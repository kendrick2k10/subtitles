3
00:01:32.844 --> 00:01:35.180
Take them into the forest now.

4
00:02:01.372 --> 00:02:03.416
You stay here.

5
00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.460
I'll be back soon.

6
00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:08.546
- Wait!
- No!

7
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:10.340
I said. stay here!

8
00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:18.890
Father! Wait!

9
00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:22.620
Help us! Please!

10
00:03:22.704 --> 00:03:23.746
Hello! ls anybody there?

11
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.705
Eat!

12
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.126
Eat!

13
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:02.553
Eat!

14
00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:06.057
Eat!

15
00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:13.231
This oven's not hot enough!

16
00:05:13.314 --> 00:05:14.357
More wood!

17
00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:44.595
What?

18
00:06:09.287 --> 00:06:11.372
Is it hot enough for you now. bitch?

19
00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:20.214
<i>My sister and I
never saw our parents again.</i>

20
00:06:21.174 --> 00:06:23.259
<i>It was just the two of us.</i>

21
00:06:23.968 --> 00:06:26.804
<i>But we learned a couple of things
while trapped in that house.</i>

22
00:06:27.972 --> 00:06:31.142
<i>One: Never walk into a house
made of candy.</i>

23
00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:37.356
<i>And two: If you're gonna kill a witch.</i>

24
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.733
<i>set her ass on fire.</i>

25
00:09:06.797 --> 00:09:09.050
Fresh milk! Fresh milk

26
00:09:09.133 --> 00:09:13.387
for the children!
Keep your children healthy! Fresh milk!

27
00:09:14.764 --> 00:09:17.600
After weeks of living in fear.

28
00:09:17.683 --> 00:09:22.688
we have finally caught the one
responsible for all this terror!

29
00:09:22.772 --> 00:09:27.443
For crimes against
the city and people of Augsburg.

30
00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:33.866
and for consorting with
the spawn of Satan.

31
00:09:35.243 --> 00:09:39.789
I hereby accuse this woman

32
00:09:40.957 --> 00:09:44.418
of the craft of witchery!

33
00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:47.380
Burn her! Burn her!

34
00:09:49.257 --> 00:09:50.591
Behold

35
00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:53.552
the eyes of the demon.

36
00:09:56.013 --> 00:09:57.223
Go to hell.

37
00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:06.983
Order!

38
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:08.484
Order!

39
00:10:12.697 --> 00:10:13.739
Berringer.

40
00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:16.534
this is still my town.

41
00:10:19.203 --> 00:10:20.663
Listen to me.

42
00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:24.500
As your mayor. I know only too well

43
00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:29.046
that many of you
have lost precious loved ones to this

44
00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:33.009
witch plague.
but we can't just burn this woman.

45
00:10:33.092 --> 00:10:35.136
We first need evidence.

46
00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:36.429
We can't just have...

47
00:10:36.512 --> 00:10:39.724
You know a witch when you see one!

48
00:10:39.807 --> 00:10:43.894
They ride at night
and they make pacts with the devil!

49
00:10:44.937 --> 00:10:48.524
This woman will burn!

50
00:10:48.607 --> 00:10:51.068
Burn her! Burn her!

51
00:10:58.492 --> 00:11:02.038
Let the girl go
or I'm gonna blow your sheriff's brains

52
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:04.248
all over these fucking hillbillies.

53
00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:08.169
Move. Go on.

54
00:11:08.252 --> 00:11:10.671
Let her go. Go over there.

55
00:11:10.755 --> 00:11:11.797
Check her.

56
00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:15.092
What's your name?

57
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.595
What's your name?

58
00:11:18.304 --> 00:11:20.389
- Mina.
- Don't worry.

59
00:11:20.765 --> 00:11:24.435
When a woman truly deals in witchcraft.
she cannot hide it.

60
00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:29.315
A nasty rot sets in. it shows in her teeth.

61
00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:31.067
in her skin and her eyes.

62
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.278
This is not a witch. This woman's clean.

63
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:40.409
I'm sure your sheriff was only trying
to protect you good people.

64
00:11:40.493 --> 00:11:42.828
But your mayor has done
a very smart thing.

65
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:45.915
He hired us.

66
00:11:45.998 --> 00:11:48.042
My name is Gretel.

67
00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:50.336
and this is my brother. Hansel.

68
00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:53.756
We know that many of your children
have gone missing.

69
00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:57.218
But killing an innocent woman
will not bring them back.

70
00:11:57.301 --> 00:11:59.387
Go home! We don't want you here!

71
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.971
We don't want more evil in Augsburg!

72
00:12:01.055 --> 00:12:04.225
Well. evil is upon you.
whether you like it or not.

73
00:12:05.309 --> 00:12:07.353
Now if your children are still alive.

74
00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:11.982
we will find them.
But if anyone harms this woman.

75
00:12:13.484 --> 00:12:15.236
you're gonna have me to deal with.

76
00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:17.238
Now go home!

77
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:19.156
Go!

78
00:12:28.499 --> 00:12:30.751
I guess you're free to go.

79
00:12:32.294 --> 00:12:33.462
Thank you.

80
00:12:35.506 --> 00:12:36.674
Hansel.

81
00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.176
You're welcome.

82
00:12:41.053 --> 00:12:43.889
What the hell do you think
you're doing? Huh?

83
00:12:43.973 --> 00:12:47.601
That woman is a suspect in my custody.
You can't just come here...

84
00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:51.021
Any man with half a brain
could see that she was not a witch.

85
00:12:51.439 --> 00:12:52.731
Now listen. Sheriff.

86
00:12:52.815 --> 00:12:54.608
Hansel and Gretel
have been brought here...

87
00:12:54.692 --> 00:12:56.694
You better listen!

88
00:12:57.862 --> 00:13:01.240
I'm not going to have this bitch
and her scoundrel of a brother

89
00:13:01.907 --> 00:13:03.242
coming into my town.

90
00:13:05.536 --> 00:13:07.204
telling me what to do.

91
00:13:13.878 --> 00:13:15.713
Don't!

92
00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:17.798
Just don't.

93
00:13:22.887 --> 00:13:25.598
Come on. Let's get you started.

94
00:13:26.724 --> 00:13:30.269
<i>There's been reports of
a strange cottage in the north forest.</i>

95
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.314
<i>Locals won't go near the place.</i>

96
00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:37.234
<i>A good place to start the investigation.</i>

97
00:13:52.208 --> 00:13:53.751
Move!

98
00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:39.898
Gretel!

99
00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:03.130
She looks angry.

100
00:16:03.881 --> 00:16:05.716
Yeah.

101
00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:08.469
A face like that. I'd be angry. too.

102
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:12.640
Would you shut up?

103
00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:16.018
<i>That witch we found
was a dead end. Mayor</i>

104
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:17.770
<i>No trace of any kids. I'm sorry.</i>

105
00:16:17.853 --> 00:16:19.688
But we found this.

106
00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:24.693
That is called the Blood Moon. Mayor.

107
00:16:25.444 --> 00:16:26.945
An eclipse of the moon.

108
00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:30.115
It happens once in a generation
and is a night most holy to witches.

109
00:16:30.908 --> 00:16:32.201
Oh. my God.

110
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:33.911
When?

111
00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:36.914
According to this.
three nights from now.

112
00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:39.458
There's no doubt in my mind
that all this is connected.

113
00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.502
Children being taken in these numbers

114
00:16:41.585 --> 00:16:43.629
from the roads and fields
so close to town.

115
00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:47.424
A witch does not come out
in the open like that.

116
00:16:47.508 --> 00:16:49.009
Not unless she has to.

117
00:16:51.595 --> 00:16:54.431
Witch activity
has been increasing lately.

118
00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:57.518
More sightings.
animal slaughter. Sabbaths.

119
00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:00.104
It seems the coming of the Blood Moon

120
00:17:00.187 --> 00:17:03.440
is dragging every damned witch
from their dark hiding place.

121
00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:06.443
So.

122
00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:08.529
it seems like a good thing

123
00:17:08.612 --> 00:17:10.572
that you brought us here.
doesn't it. Mayor?

124
00:17:11.824 --> 00:17:13.075
Half your money now.

125
00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:17.287
The rest when the children
are brought back alive.

126
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:20.541
Oh. there he is. right on time.

127
00:17:20.624 --> 00:17:23.460
This is Jackson.
He knows these woods inside and out.

128
00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:25.963
And he'll take you to where
the last sightings were.

129
00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:28.549
Yeah. We can be there in a few hours.

130
00:17:28.632 --> 00:17:31.301
Not at night. it's too dangerous.

131
00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:32.553
We'll leave in the morning.

132
00:17:32.636 --> 00:17:34.638
Yeah. she's right.
It's much too dangerous.

133
00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:39.059
So. any place
we can get a drink in this hellhole?

134
00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:46.692
Shut up!

135
00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:49.862
The last one they took was a boy.

136
00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:54.158
Less than two days ago.
so the scent is still fresh.

137
00:17:55.534 --> 00:18:00.497
100 shilling for every child
you return alive.

138
00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:02.541
You better be fast

139
00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:06.086
before our mayor's witch hunters

140
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.380
rob this town blind.

141
00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:10.174
You leave tonight.

142
00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:15.429
In witch country at night?

143
00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:16.680
You must be out of your mind.

144
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.489
Not until you finish the job.

145
00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:38.994
Thank you. Wolfgang.

146
00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:22.204
I'm telling you.

147
00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:24.748
we should put the fire out.

148
00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:26.041
We're hunting witches.

149
00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:29.837
not bears. And we have to eat.

150
00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:57.823
Such beautiful creatures.

151
00:20:01.118 --> 00:20:02.744
Are they yours?

152
00:20:04.121 --> 00:20:05.289
Yes. ma'am.

153
00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.334
Why have you come here?

154
00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:13.964
To the dark of the forest?

155
00:20:15.716 --> 00:20:17.384
A child was taken. ma'am.

156
00:20:19.553 --> 00:20:22.431
We're here to find him
and take him back.

157
00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:26.435
There are no children here.

158
00:20:29.897 --> 00:20:31.231
Here...

159
00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.401
There's only death!

160
00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:37.738
Witch!

161
00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:39.781
Fools!

162
00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:49.833
This is my land!

163
00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.427
How dare you?

164
00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:19.029
Please?

165
00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:23.116
Please. God... No.

166
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.744
There's no use in praying. my friend.

167
00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:32.042
Even your God knows better
than to come here.

168
00:21:52.688 --> 00:21:55.315
So we got this witch
on the ground. right?

169
00:21:55.399 --> 00:21:59.069
And her eyes. they start rolling back
in her head. They're glowing red.

170
00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:01.279
She's trying to put
a Soul Searcher spell on me. you see.

171
00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:03.865
So I slap her and rip out her tongue.

172
00:22:03.949 --> 00:22:08.829
And she starts pissing.
starts pissing everywhere. right?

173
00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:11.331
But a witch's piss.
it's the worst. you see.

174
00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:14.626
because it actually burns the ground.
It's like acid.

175
00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:19.214
Although. in small doses.
it does cure poison ivy. insect bites.

176
00:22:19.297 --> 00:22:21.258
I'm getting way off the subject. aren't I?

177
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:23.969
I've got to get back to my friends.

178
00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:30.934
What are you looking at?

179
00:22:31.435 --> 00:22:34.187
There have been
abductions here and here.

180
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:35.605
on both sides of the river.

181
00:22:35.981 --> 00:22:37.649
And on this last one.

182
00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:40.027
we believe a troll was involved.

183
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.320
- A troll?
- Trolls are extra.

184
00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:46.033
Hey. so what's wrong with the girls
in this place. huh?

185
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:47.367
I mean. correct me if I'm wrong.

186
00:22:47.451 --> 00:22:49.786
but aren't bar wenches
supposed to be easy?

187
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.956
- It's really unusual.
- Yes. it is unusual.

188
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:54.082
Look at this one.

189
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.626
A father and three children attacked.

190
00:22:57.294 --> 00:22:59.755
One child was taken.
but she didn't touch the other two.

191
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.590
That's weird.

192
00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:02.716
That's so weird.

193
00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:05.594
- It is strange. it is strange. okay!
- Yeah. yeah.

194
00:23:05.677 --> 00:23:07.387
Then again.
we hunt witches for a living.

195
00:23:07.471 --> 00:23:08.555
What's normal. really?

196
00:23:08.638 --> 00:23:11.558
Excuse me. Hansel and Gretel?

197
00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:13.477
Oh. my God. I can't believe you're here.

198
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.395
I'm Ben. Benjamin Walser.

199
00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:18.065
I am really quite a fan of your work.

200
00:23:18.148 --> 00:23:19.232
That's great.

201
00:23:19.316 --> 00:23:21.068
It's nice to meet you. Benjamin.

202
00:23:21.151 --> 00:23:22.778
Listen. if it's not too much trouble.

203
00:23:22.861 --> 00:23:24.571
-would you please sign...
- Oh. no...

204
00:23:24.654 --> 00:23:26.406
Okay.

205
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.991
Oh. my.

206
00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:30.577
Yeah. that's from when you
found the Fox Witch of Antwerp

207
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.787
and sank her in the moat.

208
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.748
And this one's from the
Secret Witch Ring of Belsen.

209
00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:37.667
When they tried to put a gate to
hell under the courthouse.

210
00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:40.420
I mean. you guys. you certainly
taught those witches a thing or two.

211
00:23:40.504 --> 00:23:41.588
Wow.

212
00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:44.591
This is amazing. And weird.

213
00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:46.426
- A little creepy.
- Yeah...

214
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.095
You really keep all this stuff.

215
00:23:48.178 --> 00:23:49.179
All right. well...

216
00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:51.890
I just have so many questions.
Do you mind?

217
00:23:51.973 --> 00:23:53.517
- You know. we have...
- Oh. no. no.

218
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.268
- You go ahead.
- All right.

219
00:23:56.895 --> 00:23:59.981
Okay. How do you best kill a witch?

220
00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:01.149
Hansel?

221
00:24:02.692 --> 00:24:05.278
Cutting off their heads tends to work.

222
00:24:05.362 --> 00:24:06.613
Ripping out their hearts.

223
00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:08.490
And skinning them is also nice.

224
00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:10.534
Yeah. but burning is the best way.

225
00:24:10.617 --> 00:24:12.536
'Cause that's the only way to be safe.

226
00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:15.205
- Burning. yeah. of course.
- Burn them all.

227
00:24:15.288 --> 00:24:18.041
Is it true that witches can't harm you?

228
00:24:19.626 --> 00:24:21.795
Well. no. that is horseshit. son.

229
00:24:21.878 --> 00:24:23.547
Their magic doesn't work on us.

230
00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:26.258
And they haven't killed us. yet.

231
00:24:26.341 --> 00:24:27.634
Do you think that's because of

232
00:24:27.717 --> 00:24:30.053
the witch that you burned
when you were children?

233
00:24:30.137 --> 00:24:32.472
I guess that's how
it all started for you guys.

234
00:24:32.556 --> 00:24:34.766
I mean. is that how
you became witch hunters?

235
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:35.976
How did you get your guns?

236
00:24:36.059 --> 00:24:37.310
- How did you get your weapons?
- Okay. okay.

237
00:24:37.394 --> 00:24:40.272
There's lots of things to do.
You're a really nice kid.

238
00:24:40.355 --> 00:24:42.482
but we have a town under attack.

239
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.530
She killed them!

240
00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:52.993
She killed them all.

241
00:24:53.827 --> 00:24:55.412
Who killed what?

242
00:24:55.996 --> 00:24:57.164
The witch!

243
00:24:58.165 --> 00:25:00.208
She killed the trackers. All of them.

244
00:25:01.501 --> 00:25:03.795
She gave me a message.

245
00:25:04.963 --> 00:25:06.298
For you all.

246
00:25:27.777 --> 00:25:29.738
The Curse of Hunger
for Crawling Things.

247
00:25:33.617 --> 00:25:35.202
I fucking hate that one.

248
00:25:35.285 --> 00:25:37.787
That was awesome.

249
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.473
The witch hunters are near.
I can smell their stench.

250
00:25:56.973 --> 00:25:58.642
Your plan's working.

251
00:25:59.434 --> 00:26:01.311
Did you bring the preparations?

252
00:26:01.394 --> 00:26:02.979
Of course. Muriel.

253
00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:06.441
Oiled frogs.
fattened on possum maggots.

254
00:26:06.524 --> 00:26:08.485
And Carpathian nightshade.

255
00:26:08.652 --> 00:26:10.695
deadly to the touch. most rare.

256
00:26:11.321 --> 00:26:12.489
And. Muriel.

257
00:26:15.116 --> 00:26:18.161
we brought something to test it with.

258
00:27:14.676 --> 00:27:16.553
Open your mouth.

259
00:27:17.929 --> 00:27:18.930
Open!

260
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.895
Swallow. little pig!

261
00:27:28.815 --> 00:27:29.816
He's ready.

262
00:27:55.342 --> 00:27:56.426
It's working.

263
00:28:04.267 --> 00:28:07.020
It's not even warm.

264
00:28:07.103 --> 00:28:10.065
Muriel. this could change everything.

265
00:28:10.148 --> 00:28:13.610
It will change everything.

266
00:28:14.277 --> 00:28:17.781
We will be invincible.

267
00:28:17.864 --> 00:28:19.366
Take it out.

268
00:28:19.824 --> 00:28:22.285
Take it out! Take it out!

269
00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:26.873
It's of no use if it doesn't last.

270
00:28:26.956 --> 00:28:28.583
I can make it last.

271
00:28:31.294 --> 00:28:33.421
Forever.

272
00:29:00.824 --> 00:29:02.325
Where are we going?

273
00:29:03.159 --> 00:29:04.661
We're almost there.

274
00:29:14.003 --> 00:29:15.422
Hey.

275
00:29:16.464 --> 00:29:17.507
Hey.

276
00:29:18.341 --> 00:29:20.176
I just had this really weird dream.

277
00:29:21.177 --> 00:29:23.263
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

278
00:29:23.346 --> 00:29:24.472
About what?

279
00:29:28.184 --> 00:29:31.104
I think it was about our mother.

280
00:29:33.106 --> 00:29:34.858
We don't talk about that.

281
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.445
Go to sleep.

282
00:30:12.061 --> 00:30:14.397
What do you think? Boy. girl?

283
00:30:14.856 --> 00:30:17.442
Okay. Here you go. I'll take this.

284
00:30:22.697 --> 00:30:24.491
A little small for you. maybe.

285
00:30:25.074 --> 00:30:26.784
Oh. hello.

286
00:30:27.368 --> 00:30:29.370
No. this. this is...

287
00:30:30.205 --> 00:30:31.539
This is not for me.

288
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:35.752
So. how goes the witch hunting?

289
00:30:35.835 --> 00:30:38.505
It's good. Witch hunting's good.

290
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.677
It's strange being among these people.

291
00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:45.803
Yeah?

292
00:30:46.596 --> 00:30:48.681
If you hadn't come.
they'd have burned me alive.

293
00:30:49.724 --> 00:30:51.559
Yeah. well. I probably
would have let them.

294
00:30:51.643 --> 00:30:53.603
but I'm old-fashioned that way.

295
00:30:53.728 --> 00:30:56.731
My sister. however.
requires a little bit more evidence

296
00:30:56.814 --> 00:30:58.191
before someone gets roasted.

297
00:31:01.861 --> 00:31:04.572
Have you ever come across a witch
that you didn't want to kill?

298
00:31:04.656 --> 00:31:06.032
No. never.

299
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.868
The only good witch is a dead witch.

300
00:31:13.289 --> 00:31:14.958
Can you hold this?

301
00:31:22.966 --> 00:31:24.133
Are you all right?

302
00:31:24.467 --> 00:31:25.635
Yeah.

303
00:31:29.305 --> 00:31:30.848
When I was a kid.

304
00:31:31.641 --> 00:31:34.060
a witch made me eat
so much candy. I got sick.

305
00:31:35.186 --> 00:31:38.856
Something happened to me.
I have to take this injection

306
00:31:39.607 --> 00:31:41.526
every few hours or else I die.

307
00:31:43.111 --> 00:31:44.821
You have the sugar sickness.

308
00:31:47.198 --> 00:31:50.076
I actually know a thing or two about it
if you ever need any help...

309
00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:51.828
it's all right.

310
00:31:51.911 --> 00:31:53.621
- So...
- I'm fine.

311
00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:03.339
It was good seeing you.

312
00:32:03.423 --> 00:32:04.507
Yeah.

313
00:32:05.091 --> 00:32:06.676
You're very handsome.

314
00:32:07.385 --> 00:32:09.470
And no man in this town
will walk with me.

315
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:13.349
And you have

316
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.143
my pumpkin.

317
00:32:19.355 --> 00:32:21.274
L... l have to go.

318
00:32:22.191 --> 00:32:23.359
See you.

319
00:32:39.917 --> 00:32:41.669
It'll all be perfect.

320
00:32:41.753 --> 00:32:45.798
Daddy! Daddy. please help me! I'm lost!

321
00:32:49.427 --> 00:32:51.095
Daddy. please!

322
00:32:55.224 --> 00:32:57.393
Please help me! I'm lost!

323
00:32:59.771 --> 00:33:02.940
Daddy. I'm scared!
I'm alone in the woods!

324
00:33:03.608 --> 00:33:05.943
I can help you. little boy.

325
00:33:06.444 --> 00:33:07.987
Sweet little boy.

326
00:33:08.613 --> 00:33:09.739
Please help me!

327
00:33:10.615 --> 00:33:12.575
Daddy! I'm scared!

328
00:33:12.742 --> 00:33:14.577
I'm alone in the woods!

329
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:19.290
<i>Please help...</i>

330
00:33:26.255 --> 00:33:27.965
You move. you die.

331
00:33:30.468 --> 00:33:31.719
Get her wand.

332
00:34:35.158 --> 00:34:36.159
Will you stop that?

333
00:35:15.364 --> 00:35:16.949
I like your toys.

334
00:35:18.409 --> 00:35:22.497
They have brought
a live witch into my office!

335
00:35:22.622 --> 00:35:26.375
They need to interrogate her.
That's all there is to it. Now...

336
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.546
Good night. Sheriff.

337
00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.772
Hey. wake up.

338
00:35:49.482 --> 00:35:50.733
What is she doing?

339
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.694
I have no idea.

340
00:36:10.753 --> 00:36:12.255
I see them.

341
00:36:13.172 --> 00:36:14.549
Is she there?

342
00:36:15.216 --> 00:36:16.926
That Gretel bitch?

343
00:36:17.844 --> 00:36:21.180
Yes. under the moon.

344
00:36:21.514 --> 00:36:23.099
over the sheriff.

345
00:36:24.225 --> 00:36:25.226
in the town.

346
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.031
There she is.

347
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:41.951
Good morning. sunshine.

348
00:36:42.076 --> 00:36:44.871
You tell us what we want
and this might not end up

349
00:36:44.954 --> 00:36:46.706
being the most painful night of your life.

350
00:36:46.789 --> 00:36:48.124
Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?

351
00:36:49.584 --> 00:36:52.086
No. no. better. fuck each other.

352
00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:57.216
These witches. they never learn.

353
00:37:04.932 --> 00:37:06.309
Let's try this again.

354
00:37:07.059 --> 00:37:10.479
Where are the children? Why so many?

355
00:37:11.397 --> 00:37:12.398
Where are the children?

356
00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:14.609
The blood of the twelve moons

357
00:37:14.692 --> 00:37:16.944
will soon be collected.

358
00:37:18.821 --> 00:37:20.156
And after that.

359
00:37:20.615 --> 00:37:23.951
only one object remains.

360
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.371
Why don't you just burn her?

361
00:37:27.872 --> 00:37:29.790
We're wasting our time. She's useless.

362
00:37:29.874 --> 00:37:32.501
Twelve moons. Twelve...

363
00:37:32.627 --> 00:37:34.045
Twelve. twelve...

364
00:37:34.128 --> 00:37:36.464
How many children
have been taken so far?

365
00:37:36.839 --> 00:37:38.591
I don't know. ten or eleven.

366
00:37:38.674 --> 00:37:40.509
The files. We need to count them.

367
00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:49.477
- It's eleven.
- Eleven. Twelve moons.

368
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.312
They need one more child.
One more child.

369
00:37:51.395 --> 00:37:52.897
Look.
there's gotta be some sort of pattern.

370
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.273
- Look for their age...
- Yeah.

371
00:37:54.357 --> 00:37:55.733
...hair color. genders. something.

372
00:37:55.816 --> 00:37:58.194
- I've got five girls.
- Six boys.

373
00:37:58.903 --> 00:38:00.029
You need another girl?

374
00:38:00.738 --> 00:38:02.114
"Twelve moons." what does that mean?

375
00:38:02.198 --> 00:38:03.866
It's a month. it's a month.

376
00:38:05.868 --> 00:38:07.828
There's no April. April is missing.
It's April.

377
00:38:07.954 --> 00:38:09.580
They need a girl born in April.

378
00:38:11.707 --> 00:38:13.125
You are too late.

379
00:38:22.593 --> 00:38:23.636
- Go!
- Yes!

380
00:38:26.055 --> 00:38:29.141
Sheriff. birth records of Augsburg.
Do you have them here?

381
00:38:29.225 --> 00:38:33.771
It is there.
Strictly for the law of this town. not for

382
00:38:33.854 --> 00:38:35.648
filthy bounty hunters like yourself.

383
00:38:35.731 --> 00:38:36.774
Come on.

384
00:38:37.817 --> 00:38:39.068
There can't be that many.

385
00:38:44.532 --> 00:38:45.700
- Anything?
- I only got one!

386
00:38:45.783 --> 00:38:47.618
Little girl. six years old. born April 8th.

387
00:38:48.744 --> 00:38:50.371
- She's the only one I could find.
- You go.

388
00:38:51.372 --> 00:38:52.456
This girl. do you know her?

389
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.458
Yes. I know her. Mary Behlmer.

390
00:38:54.542 --> 00:38:57.003
Where does she live?
Sheriff. she's in danger!

391
00:39:06.887 --> 00:39:08.014
Fire! Fire!

392
00:39:10.182 --> 00:39:12.268
Time is up. Tell me where she lives.

393
00:39:26.032 --> 00:39:27.283
Over here!

394
00:39:34.832 --> 00:39:37.043
Mama!

395
00:39:42.465 --> 00:39:44.133
Stop! Stop right there!

396
00:39:47.428 --> 00:39:49.638
Oh. no! No. no. Oh. no.

397
00:39:49.889 --> 00:39:51.599
No. Lucas! Lucas.

398
00:39:53.476 --> 00:39:54.643
No!

399
00:39:59.398 --> 00:40:01.442
Damn you!

400
00:40:02.068 --> 00:40:05.154
Too late. already damned.

401
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.993
Take her back!

402
00:40:20.002 --> 00:40:21.420
To the well!

403
00:40:21.504 --> 00:40:22.588
Over here!

404
00:40:23.339 --> 00:40:25.633
We need more help!

405
00:40:33.516 --> 00:40:36.018
Now whatever happens.
I want you to stay cool.

406
00:40:36.894 --> 00:40:39.772
- Follow my lead. Okay?
- Got it.

407
00:40:39.855 --> 00:40:41.565
Are you a good shot?

408
00:40:41.649 --> 00:40:42.983
No.

409
00:40:43.067 --> 00:40:44.527
Not really.

410
00:40:46.695 --> 00:40:48.030
That's why I use a shotgun.

411
00:41:01.127 --> 00:41:02.294
Gretel.

412
00:41:02.837 --> 00:41:04.505
the famous witch hunter.

413
00:41:06.048 --> 00:41:07.550
Finally we meet.

414
00:41:07.967 --> 00:41:09.093
Who are you?

415
00:41:12.012 --> 00:41:13.556
I see you got my invitation.

416
00:41:14.515 --> 00:41:17.309
Say your name
or I'll pin you to the fucking wall.

417
00:41:17.893 --> 00:41:19.228
I go by many names.

418
00:41:20.229 --> 00:41:23.899
none of which
you're worthy of pronouncing.

419
00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:30.364
Oh. my God.

420
00:41:49.758 --> 00:41:51.051
Help! Help!

421
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:53.846
Please!

422
00:41:55.347 --> 00:41:56.390
Hey!

423
00:42:06.817 --> 00:42:07.943
Fuck you!

424
00:42:09.445 --> 00:42:11.363
Help!

425
00:42:15.534 --> 00:42:16.869
Feisty bitch.

426
00:43:15.427 --> 00:43:17.471
Shit.

427
00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:34.321
Don't worry. I'm not going to kill you.

428
00:43:34.947 --> 00:43:36.198
Not now.

429
00:43:37.032 --> 00:43:38.575
And not like this.

430
00:43:40.911 --> 00:43:42.621
You

431
00:43:42.705 --> 00:43:44.540
have something I need.

432
00:43:45.666 --> 00:43:48.335
The last ingredient.

433
00:44:13.068 --> 00:44:16.905
Humans have such ghastly taste.

434
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:29.335
I think this place...

435
00:44:33.797 --> 00:44:35.632
...could use a bit

436
00:44:40.429 --> 00:44:42.097
of color.

437
00:45:00.949 --> 00:45:02.659
Shit!

438
00:45:11.585 --> 00:45:12.961
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

439
00:45:18.967 --> 00:45:22.179
Yes. No. people. Please be calm.

440
00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:24.473
Yeah. one at a time.

441
00:45:26.558 --> 00:45:32.981
Look what his witch hunters
have brought to Augsburg.

442
00:45:34.858 --> 00:45:38.362
Seven people burnt to death in the fire.

443
00:45:38.987 --> 00:45:43.492
And another young. innocent child taken

444
00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:47.162
because of those witch hunters.

445
00:45:48.539 --> 00:45:49.540
No.

446
00:45:51.166 --> 00:45:52.876
Because of you.

447
00:45:55.504 --> 00:45:58.090
I say bring them all to justice.

448
00:45:58.173 --> 00:45:59.425
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

449
00:45:59.508 --> 00:46:01.510
No! No!

450
00:46:03.053 --> 00:46:06.223
The witch hunters are not the ones
to blame for this.

451
00:46:08.183 --> 00:46:09.685
This is madness.

452
00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:11.562
People.

453
00:46:12.813 --> 00:46:14.773
hasn't enough blood been shed?

454
00:46:25.993 --> 00:46:27.119
No. no...

455
00:46:27.202 --> 00:46:28.620
Not enough. Mayor.

456
00:46:30.581 --> 00:46:31.748
Not yet.

457
00:47:09.161 --> 00:47:10.579
- Good morning.
- What are you doing?

458
00:47:10.662 --> 00:47:14.249
You were covered in filth. so I was just

459
00:47:15.083 --> 00:47:16.293
cleaning.

460
00:47:28.263 --> 00:47:29.848
What happened?

461
00:47:32.518 --> 00:47:34.186
Well. the witches took a young girl.

462
00:47:34.269 --> 00:47:36.772
and a lot of people died in the fires.

463
00:47:37.189 --> 00:47:39.399
And now the Sheriff.
he's blaming you and your brother

464
00:47:39.483 --> 00:47:40.859
for what happened last night.

465
00:47:41.527 --> 00:47:43.362
Augsburg's not really
safe for you anymore.

466
00:47:43.445 --> 00:47:44.863
And my brother?

467
00:47:44.947 --> 00:47:46.281
Last time I saw him.
he was fighting one of them

468
00:47:46.365 --> 00:47:48.617
on her broom. flying out of town.

469
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:56.708
Right.

470
00:47:58.627 --> 00:47:59.962
Wow.

471
00:48:00.629 --> 00:48:02.548
Where did you get all this stuff?

472
00:48:04.132 --> 00:48:05.467
From everywhere.

473
00:48:06.051 --> 00:48:08.845
I actually plan to be a witch hunter.
too. when I get older.

474
00:48:08.929 --> 00:48:09.972
Like you guys.

475
00:48:10.889 --> 00:48:12.683
This isn't the life we chose. Ben.

476
00:48:17.646 --> 00:48:19.815
I was wondering about that story

477
00:48:20.816 --> 00:48:22.985
about your parents leaving you.

478
00:48:23.485 --> 00:48:24.987
Is all that true?

479
00:48:25.654 --> 00:48:26.697
Yep.

480
00:48:29.616 --> 00:48:30.784
Why?

481
00:48:32.786 --> 00:48:34.121
I don't know.

482
00:48:34.788 --> 00:48:36.456
That's what they did.

483
00:48:41.628 --> 00:48:44.631
I'm sorry. Do you want some porridge?

484
00:48:45.632 --> 00:48:46.967
Sure.

485
00:48:57.144 --> 00:49:01.315
Not too hot. not too cold. but just right.

486
00:49:09.865 --> 00:49:11.199
So last night.

487
00:49:11.325 --> 00:49:13.910
who was she.
the witch who attacked us?

488
00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.121
I don't know.

489
00:49:16.204 --> 00:49:20.208
She looked normal
at first. but then she changed her face.

490
00:49:21.126 --> 00:49:23.712
- I thought only Grand...
- Grand Witches have that ability. yeah.

491
00:49:31.094 --> 00:49:33.180
Who is this?

492
00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:41.188
She lived outside of town
a long time ago.

493
00:49:43.273 --> 00:49:46.026
<i>She was accused of witchcraft.
but she never confessed.</i>

494
00:49:47.027 --> 00:49:48.820
We just burned her anyway.

495
00:49:49.488 --> 00:49:50.572
You're safe.

496
00:49:51.615 --> 00:49:52.658
You'll be safe.

497
00:49:57.162 --> 00:49:58.747
I have to find my brother.

498
00:50:01.416 --> 00:50:02.751
Hansel!

499
00:50:03.752 --> 00:50:04.836
Hey!

500
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:06.588
Hansel! Are you all right?

501
00:50:09.966 --> 00:50:11.635
Oh. shit.

502
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:15.764
The witch hunting is going well. I see.

503
00:50:16.264 --> 00:50:17.432
Yeah.

504
00:50:20.102 --> 00:50:21.603
Hey. say. can you...

505
00:50:22.646 --> 00:50:25.357
Can you tell me
which way is back to town?

506
00:50:26.274 --> 00:50:27.275
That way.

507
00:50:29.194 --> 00:50:30.362
That way.

508
00:50:31.697 --> 00:50:32.823
Okay.

509
00:50:33.198 --> 00:50:34.366
Thank you!

510
00:50:35.534 --> 00:50:37.411
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

511
00:50:39.037 --> 00:50:41.790
- You need some help?
- No. I'm fine.

512
00:50:42.124 --> 00:50:43.792
I'm fine. Thank you.

513
00:50:44.918 --> 00:50:47.170
Okay. I'll see you later.

514
00:50:47.546 --> 00:50:49.047
Motherfucker!

515
00:50:54.136 --> 00:50:55.470
Are you okay?

516
00:50:55.637 --> 00:50:57.139
Hi. Help me.

517
00:51:05.981 --> 00:51:07.691
Hansel!

518
00:51:12.988 --> 00:51:14.656
Hansel!

519
00:51:17.075 --> 00:51:18.368
Hansel!

520
00:52:05.457 --> 00:52:06.458
Come here.

521
00:52:13.715 --> 00:52:15.050
She's a wild one. eh?

522
00:52:16.218 --> 00:52:17.552
What do you think you're doing?

523
00:52:17.928 --> 00:52:21.515
You're under arrest
for the burning of Augsburg

524
00:52:21.807 --> 00:52:24.684
and for bringing
the witch plague to our streets.

525
00:52:24.768 --> 00:52:27.979
Listen. you idiot! The witches are
planning something big!

526
00:52:28.063 --> 00:52:30.315
I need to find my brother
and save your shitty little...

527
00:52:30.398 --> 00:52:31.650
Shut up.

528
00:52:32.984 --> 00:52:34.236
This time.

529
00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:38.907
I do the talking. You do the bleeding.

530
00:52:46.248 --> 00:52:47.374
Are you done yet?

531
00:52:47.749 --> 00:52:49.543
I've got to get to my sister.

532
00:52:50.377 --> 00:52:52.087
This may take a while.

533
00:52:55.423 --> 00:52:57.592
But if we don't clean it.
you'll get the fever.

534
00:52:57.926 --> 00:52:59.845
Fever?

535
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:04.266
You've really taken a beating.
haven't you?

536
00:53:05.767 --> 00:53:08.854
I think the real damage
was to my dignity.

537
00:53:09.688 --> 00:53:12.023
which I left somewhere
in that tree back there.

538
00:53:21.283 --> 00:53:23.410
It's probably gonna be easier
if you just get in.

539
00:53:25.203 --> 00:53:26.830
Oh. no. no. No. I can't.

540
00:53:27.122 --> 00:53:28.498
The water is healing.

541
00:53:29.374 --> 00:53:31.793
Yeah. I don't swim well.

542
00:53:32.377 --> 00:53:34.296
Then I'll go in with you.

543
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:39.217
Oh. okay.

544
00:53:48.059 --> 00:53:49.477
Oh. boy.

545
00:53:59.279 --> 00:54:01.656
So. it's healing waters. did you say?

546
00:54:03.325 --> 00:54:05.327
I have a passion.

547
00:54:06.494 --> 00:54:08.663
Horses. just love them.

548
00:54:09.289 --> 00:54:10.790
Beautiful creatures. huh?

549
00:54:12.709 --> 00:54:16.755
When you break any kind of a horse.

550
00:54:16.838 --> 00:54:19.466
you have to be hard on them
from the beginning.

551
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:21.676
Show them who's boss.

552
00:54:22.385 --> 00:54:25.388
Or else. they will never learn.

553
00:54:27.515 --> 00:54:29.851
At first. they will hate you.

554
00:54:31.061 --> 00:54:33.313
But once their spirit is broken.

555
00:54:35.649 --> 00:54:38.026
they will do anything you want.

556
00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:46.493
Bitch!

557
00:55:00.924 --> 00:55:04.052
Hey. boss. maybe we should
take her back to town now.

558
00:55:05.387 --> 00:55:08.181
I'm not finished breaking her yet!

559
00:55:11.643 --> 00:55:13.895
You're making this too easy.

560
00:55:21.695 --> 00:55:22.696
I got it.

561
00:55:27.242 --> 00:55:31.079
You know. the last time
I was in waters like this.

562
00:55:31.788 --> 00:55:34.833
I came across
a formidable Serpent Witch.

563
00:55:35.625 --> 00:55:37.544
She mostly looked like a toad

564
00:55:37.627 --> 00:55:38.795
but she could breathe underwater.

565
00:55:39.087 --> 00:55:41.589
which made her difficult to track.

566
00:55:44.092 --> 00:55:45.552
She was deadly.

567
00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.555
You talk too much.

568
00:56:02.277 --> 00:56:04.446
You're pathetic.

569
00:56:06.448 --> 00:56:07.907
She has guts.

570
00:56:09.451 --> 00:56:10.994
I like that.

571
00:56:12.454 --> 00:56:15.373
That's going to make me enjoy this
even more.

572
00:56:15.957 --> 00:56:16.958
No!

573
00:56:17.042 --> 00:56:18.877
Well. boys. you can have her.

574
00:56:20.378 --> 00:56:21.379
after I'm done...

575
00:56:21.463 --> 00:56:23.548
No! No!

576
00:56:23.631 --> 00:56:25.175
...If there's anything left.

577
00:56:34.684 --> 00:56:35.685
What

578
00:56:36.978 --> 00:56:37.979
the hell?

579
00:56:46.362 --> 00:56:47.363
No!

580
00:57:46.464 --> 00:57:47.841
Following this road.
you should be able to

581
00:57:47.924 --> 00:57:50.301
make it back to Augsburg by nightfall.

582
00:57:50.718 --> 00:57:51.886
Yeah.

583
00:57:52.971 --> 00:57:54.305
I hope so.

584
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:57.142
When you find your sister.

585
00:57:57.225 --> 00:57:59.227
could you come back to see me again?

586
00:58:01.437 --> 00:58:03.273
Yes. of course.

587
00:58:38.433 --> 00:58:39.434
Drink.

588
00:58:40.268 --> 00:58:41.269
No.

589
00:58:43.771 --> 00:58:45.899
Drink!

590
00:59:22.477 --> 00:59:24.479
Why did you save me?

591
00:59:27.273 --> 00:59:28.358
Trolls

592
00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:31.402
serve witches.

593
00:59:38.326 --> 00:59:39.661
Hey. wait.

594
00:59:41.037 --> 00:59:42.747
Wait!

595
00:59:48.294 --> 00:59:49.629
What's your name?

596
00:59:51.965 --> 00:59:53.967
Edward.

597
00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:58.763
Edward. wait!

598
00:59:59.722 --> 01:00:01.015
Where am I?

599
01:01:17.592 --> 01:01:18.926
Hansel?

600
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.136
Gretel?

601
01:01:20.219 --> 01:01:22.555
Where have you been?

602
01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:31.856
- Hi.
- Hi.

603
01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:33.274
Hey. what happened to your face?

604
01:01:34.859 --> 01:01:36.361
Gretel?

605
01:01:36.444 --> 01:01:37.528
- Who did this to you?
- I'm okay.

606
01:01:37.612 --> 01:01:38.613
Who did this to you?

607
01:01:38.738 --> 01:01:39.739
I'm okay.

608
01:01:41.783 --> 01:01:43.451
Honey. I'm sorry.

609
01:01:44.619 --> 01:01:46.120
I'm sorry.

610
01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:53.294
You okay?

611
01:01:53.795 --> 01:01:55.129
I'm okay.

612
01:02:00.885 --> 01:02:01.803
Where are we?

613
01:02:03.304 --> 01:02:04.555
I don't know.

614
01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:08.601
You okay?

615
01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:10.436
Did you have to land on me?

616
01:02:14.315 --> 01:02:15.983
What is this place?

617
01:02:29.831 --> 01:02:31.958
This isn't a regular witch's lair.

618
01:02:32.041 --> 01:02:33.167
No.

619
01:02:34.919 --> 01:02:37.255
Let's get the hell out of here.

620
01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:49.934
Hey. sis?

621
01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:54.730
I think you're gonna
want to come see this.

622
01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:07.452
I think this is our old house.

623
01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.955
And this is our old room.

624
01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:14.750
Here. Look.

625
01:03:15.543 --> 01:03:16.878
There's your bed.

626
01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:18.880
Right?

627
01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:24.510
Remember this?

628
01:03:30.475 --> 01:03:31.976
I think that's you.

629
01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:35.313
And some sort of vicious badger.

630
01:03:41.152 --> 01:03:42.820
Old beds.

631
01:03:51.996 --> 01:03:53.331
Hansel.

632
01:03:56.167 --> 01:03:59.170
You ever wonder
what happened to our parents?

633
01:04:06.302 --> 01:04:08.471
We don't talk about that. Gretel.

634
01:04:08.596 --> 01:04:10.306
We made a promise. you know that.

635
01:04:10.515 --> 01:04:12.850
Why do you think
the witches' spells don't work on us?

636
01:04:12.934 --> 01:04:13.893
Leave it alone.

637
01:04:13.976 --> 01:04:15.561
- This is our house.
- Yeah?

638
01:04:15.645 --> 01:04:17.146
This is where we grew up!

639
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:19.273
And what does that look like to you?

640
01:04:19.482 --> 01:04:22.068
I don't know. Gretel.
We grew up over a witch's lair.

641
01:04:22.151 --> 01:04:23.194
So what? So we're cursed?

642
01:04:23.277 --> 01:04:25.238
No. I think that our mother was...

643
01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:32.620
I see you finally found your way
home after all these years.

644
01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:35.122
How very sweet.

645
01:04:46.175 --> 01:04:48.177
I remember this house.

646
01:04:48.678 --> 01:04:50.680
The house of Adrianna.

647
01:04:51.514 --> 01:04:53.766
the Great White Witch.

648
01:04:55.851 --> 01:04:58.563
Your whore of a mother.

649
01:05:02.817 --> 01:05:05.278
Let me tell you a little story.

650
01:05:11.033 --> 01:05:15.204
Once upon a time.
near a shitty little town.

651
01:05:16.205 --> 01:05:21.002
there was a farmer who fell
in love with a white witch.

652
01:05:21.711 --> 01:05:24.380
<i>And with their two beautiful children.</i>

653
01:05:24.714 --> 01:05:27.216
<i>oh. they were so happy.</i>

654
01:05:28.718 --> 01:05:31.220
<i>But not for long.</i>

655
01:05:33.556 --> 01:05:37.059
<i>During a Blood Moon. there is a potion</i>

656
01:05:37.393 --> 01:05:40.229
<i>that will make you immune to fire.</i>

657
01:05:41.188 --> 01:05:43.566
<i>The key to the potion</i>

658
01:05:43.649 --> 01:05:47.987
<i>is the heart of a Grand White Witch.</i>

659
01:05:49.071 --> 01:05:52.992
<i>But your mother.
the most powerful white witch.</i>

660
01:05:53.075 --> 01:05:55.077
<i>was too strong for us.</i>

661
01:05:55.745 --> 01:05:58.080
<i>So it had to be you. Gretel.</i>

662
01:05:58.414 --> 01:06:01.709
<i>It had to be your heart.</i>

663
01:06:02.627 --> 01:06:06.714
<i>As the Blood Moon approached.
I sent out a little rumor</i>

664
01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:09.634
<i>to the people of Augsburg.</i>

665
01:06:10.343 --> 01:06:12.511
<i>And when she knew they were coming.</i>

666
01:06:12.928 --> 01:06:15.681
<i>she had your father take you
into the forest to hide you.</i>

667
01:06:15.765 --> 01:06:17.141
Father! Wait!

668
01:06:18.225 --> 01:06:19.268
Don't let her get away!

669
01:06:19.352 --> 01:06:21.020
<i>She didn't know what
they would do to her.</i>

670
01:06:21.103 --> 01:06:23.439
<i>but she was too proud to run.</i>

671
01:06:23.773 --> 01:06:27.735
<i>And a white witch would never use her
magic against humans.</i>

672
01:06:29.403 --> 01:06:31.447
<i>When your father came back for her..</i>

673
01:06:32.657 --> 01:06:33.658
No!

674
01:06:33.741 --> 01:06:35.534
<i>...they hanged him.</i>

675
01:06:35.618 --> 01:06:37.787
- Run him up!
- No!

676
01:06:39.622 --> 01:06:41.957
<i>...right in front</i>

677
01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:46.253
<i>of your mother's burning flesh!</i>

678
01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:55.346
<i>Adrianna was gone.</i>

679
01:06:57.348 --> 01:06:59.600
<i>But so was your heart.</i>

680
01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:03.938
<i>And the Blood Moon passed.</i>

681
01:07:04.855 --> 01:07:06.190
The end.

682
01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:09.819
It's a beautiful story. don't you think?

683
01:07:10.945 --> 01:07:13.614
They died to save you.

684
01:07:15.991 --> 01:07:17.201
And all your life.

685
01:07:17.326 --> 01:07:19.453
how you've hated them.

686
01:07:19.787 --> 01:07:21.539
Tomorrow

687
01:07:21.622 --> 01:07:25.042
sisters from all dark corners of the land

688
01:07:25.251 --> 01:07:28.003
will join me in the light
of the Blood Moon

689
01:07:28.295 --> 01:07:30.798
for the greatest Sabbath of all.

690
01:07:31.799 --> 01:07:33.634
The only thing left

691
01:07:34.593 --> 01:07:36.929
is the everlasting power

692
01:07:37.304 --> 01:07:38.973
of the heart

693
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:41.642
of a Grand White Witch.

694
01:07:41.726 --> 01:07:42.893
You know. you talk too much.

695
01:07:53.654 --> 01:07:56.073
Bad move. witch hunter.

696
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:03.497
Hansel!

697
01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:15.509
Drink it. it will help the pain.

698
01:08:18.679 --> 01:08:19.847
Mina?

699
01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:27.938
What did you do?

700
01:08:28.022 --> 01:08:29.523
Mina?

701
01:08:36.572 --> 01:08:37.907
You're a witch?

702
01:08:38.115 --> 01:08:40.367
There are good witches in the world.

703
01:08:40.534 --> 01:08:42.620
- Not many. but some.
- You stay back.

704
01:08:42.787 --> 01:08:44.205
I'm a witch. but I won't hurt you.

705
01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:46.582
I checked you. You were...
You were clean.

706
01:08:46.665 --> 01:08:48.834
Yeah. but only the dark witches
bear the signs.

707
01:08:48.918 --> 01:08:51.420
Dark witches?
What are you talking about?

708
01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:52.546
Think about it.

709
01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:55.674
if their spells don't work on you.
why would mine?

710
01:08:56.592 --> 01:08:58.260
I'm not like them. Hansel.

711
01:09:02.556 --> 01:09:04.892
Gretel. Shit.

712
01:09:06.393 --> 01:09:09.063
- Where are you going?
- They have my sister.

713
01:09:09.146 --> 01:09:10.815
Who has your sister?

714
01:09:10.898 --> 01:09:12.900
Witches have my sister. They...

715
01:09:13.150 --> 01:09:14.819
- Where?
- They said something

716
01:09:15.277 --> 01:09:18.405
about a ritual or a gathering.
I don't know.

717
01:09:18.572 --> 01:09:21.784
There's a place deep in the forest.
nearby the mountains.

718
01:09:22.076 --> 01:09:25.246
A place dark witches use
for their Sabbath.

719
01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:26.497
Where is it?

720
01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.581
Hansel. I...

721
01:09:27.706 --> 01:09:29.124
Mina. how do I get there?

722
01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:30.960
If there is a Sabbath.
there will be many witches.

723
01:09:31.043 --> 01:09:33.879
They'll be too powerful.
They'll kill you. Hansel.

724
01:09:34.588 --> 01:09:36.090
I don't have time for this.

725
01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:39.677
No. listen. Hansel.
I found something here. in this cave.

726
01:09:40.261 --> 01:09:44.098
Something very powerful.
Something that could help us.

727
01:09:44.765 --> 01:09:47.518
The <i>Abramelin Grimoire!</i> it exists!

728
01:09:47.601 --> 01:09:49.562
This is the book
of protection against black magic.

729
01:09:51.021 --> 01:09:53.524
I can't believe this.
Where did you find it?

730
01:09:53.607 --> 01:09:55.276
Don't ask. kid.

731
01:09:55.401 --> 01:09:56.694
If this thing does what it says.

732
01:09:56.777 --> 01:09:58.529
it will allow us
to penetrate their protection.

733
01:09:58.612 --> 01:09:59.655
Oh. yeah?

734
01:09:59.822 --> 01:10:02.491
Their wands won't
protect them anymore.

735
01:10:02.658 --> 01:10:03.659
We just need something to bless.

736
01:10:03.826 --> 01:10:06.161
Okay. let's start with this.

737
01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:32.980
I hope this works.

738
01:10:36.692 --> 01:10:37.985
All right.

739
01:10:42.281 --> 01:10:43.532
You ever shoot a gun?

740
01:10:44.783 --> 01:10:47.286
Well. I did win the county fair

741
01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:49.747
three times.

742
01:10:51.457 --> 01:10:53.792
All right. In that case...

743
01:10:58.130 --> 01:11:00.007
Don't touch the gun.

744
01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:17.816
Edward.

745
01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:20.986
What are you doing here?

746
01:11:23.197 --> 01:11:24.698
What's going on?

747
01:11:28.661 --> 01:11:30.329
Muriel.

748
01:11:37.002 --> 01:11:38.379
Edward.

749
01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:40.714
I need your help.

750
01:11:45.678 --> 01:11:47.346
Please. Edward.

751
01:11:50.557 --> 01:11:54.478
Hey! You filthy oaf!

752
01:11:54.561 --> 01:11:57.064
Get the children. We're moving out.

753
01:12:02.027 --> 01:12:04.697
It's time.

754
01:12:15.082 --> 01:12:16.083
Okay. are we good?

755
01:12:16.959 --> 01:12:18.127
Yes.

756
01:12:29.263 --> 01:12:32.850
Well. as far as you go. kid.

757
01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:36.603
But. I will leave you with this.

758
01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:40.441
- Wow!
- Find a place to hide.

759
01:12:40.566 --> 01:12:41.692
Shoot anything that moves.

760
01:12:43.277 --> 01:12:44.611
Good luck.

761
01:13:05.966 --> 01:13:07.301
Shut up!

762
01:13:30.324 --> 01:13:31.700
After tonight.

763
01:13:32.493 --> 01:13:35.829
no sister will be burned on their pyres!

764
01:13:37.915 --> 01:13:41.126
No sister will be ashes on the ground!

765
01:13:41.335 --> 01:13:43.337
I want your brains!

766
01:13:44.213 --> 01:13:45.214
And now.

767
01:13:46.507 --> 01:13:49.218
now we feast!

768
01:13:49.885 --> 01:13:51.637
That's a lot of witches.

769
01:13:52.638 --> 01:13:53.639
Okay.

770
01:13:54.181 --> 01:13:56.225
I'm gonna go down
around the other side.

771
01:13:56.725 --> 01:13:59.394
Push them into the middle.
get them away from the kids.

772
01:13:59.853 --> 01:14:02.564
Now. when you see my signal.
you unleash hell.

773
01:14:02.648 --> 01:14:03.774
Wish me luck.

774
01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:05.442
Wait. Wait. What's the signal?

775
01:14:05.526 --> 01:14:09.696
It'll be me blowing one of these
bitches' heads off.

776
01:14:15.702 --> 01:14:17.121
Yes.

777
01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:21.333
The hour has come!

778
01:14:22.543 --> 01:14:25.546
The Blood Moon arrives!

779
01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:31.343
The Grand White Witch dies!

780
01:14:37.683 --> 01:14:42.104
Excuse me! Excuse me. ladies. Hi.

781
01:14:43.647 --> 01:14:47.151
It seems as if I've lost my invitation
to your little dinner party here.

782
01:14:47.276 --> 01:14:48.569
I apologize.

783
01:14:48.694 --> 01:14:51.697
But don't worry.
I didn't come empty-handed.

784
01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.825
Sisters!

785
01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:01.123
Allow me to introduce you
to the famous witch hunter Hansel.

786
01:15:02.207 --> 01:15:07.296
Personally responsible for the deaths
of over 600.

787
01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.092
Listen to me carefully!

788
01:15:12.634 --> 01:15:16.138
If you let my sister
and the children go now.

789
01:15:16.638 --> 01:15:20.142
I'll consider not killing
each and every one of you.

790
01:15:26.648 --> 01:15:27.649
Enough with this.

791
01:15:30.694 --> 01:15:32.404
- Take his fucking head off.
- Yes.

792
01:15:42.289 --> 01:15:43.707
Please work.

793
01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:38.512
We have to hurry. You get the children.
I'll get her heart!

794
01:16:38.595 --> 01:16:39.930
Now. move!

795
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:58.282
Fucking...

796
01:17:09.876 --> 01:17:10.877
Eat it!

797
01:17:20.887 --> 01:17:22.306
Walk!

798
01:17:22.389 --> 01:17:23.557
Move it!

799
01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:30.397
Come on!

800
01:17:30.897 --> 01:17:31.982
Gretel!

801
01:17:37.529 --> 01:17:38.739
Edward.

802
01:17:39.156 --> 01:17:40.157
Gretel!

803
01:17:41.199 --> 01:17:43.493
I'm okay! Go get the children!

804
01:17:45.037 --> 01:17:46.121
Stay still!

805
01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:51.335
Get off of me!

806
01:18:11.188 --> 01:18:12.356
No!

807
01:18:25.243 --> 01:18:26.578
Thank you!

808
01:18:55.273 --> 01:18:56.608
- Shit!
- Too late.

809
01:19:05.909 --> 01:19:07.077
Gretel!

810
01:19:36.356 --> 01:19:37.691
Thank you.

811
01:19:42.028 --> 01:19:43.530
You okay?

812
01:19:43.613 --> 01:19:45.031
Muriel's still alive.

813
01:19:45.157 --> 01:19:46.741
I'm not done.

814
01:19:46.825 --> 01:19:48.493
Gretel. Mina. Mina. Gretel.

815
01:19:48.577 --> 01:19:50.579
- Hey.
- I need that.

816
01:19:50.662 --> 01:19:51.788
- Okay.
- She flew off that way.

817
01:19:55.542 --> 01:19:57.169
Well. where are you going?

818
01:19:57.252 --> 01:19:58.462
I have to help Edward!

819
01:19:58.628 --> 01:20:01.882
Edward. Who the fuck's Edward?

820
01:20:57.938 --> 01:21:00.106
- Hell. yeah!
- Ben!

821
01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:03.276
Hansel! Hansel!

822
01:21:03.485 --> 01:21:05.570
I did it! I shot her! Muriel.

823
01:21:05.654 --> 01:21:08.657
- Where?
- I shot her down. over there.

824
01:21:08.782 --> 01:21:09.950
Good job.

825
01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:18.792
She's close.

826
01:21:30.136 --> 01:21:31.555
Edward?

827
01:22:15.473 --> 01:22:17.392
You can't be serious.

828
01:22:30.947 --> 01:22:32.449
Is this...

829
01:22:32.866 --> 01:22:34.451
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

830
01:22:35.368 --> 01:22:36.369
Wow.

831
01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:40.624
Whatever you do.
don't eat the fucking candy.

832
01:22:52.552 --> 01:22:54.721
Stop right there.

833
01:22:54.888 --> 01:22:56.890
or the little boy dies.

834
01:22:58.141 --> 01:23:01.144
I thought it would
be fitting for us to end up here.

835
01:23:01.478 --> 01:23:03.063
where it all began.

836
01:23:03.647 --> 01:23:06.107
Kind of lost its charm a little. huh?

837
01:23:06.733 --> 01:23:07.901
Drop it.

838
01:23:13.573 --> 01:23:14.574
Good boy.

839
01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:17.160
Don't worry. kid.

840
01:23:18.995 --> 01:23:20.080
I'm not gonna let her hurt you.

841
01:23:20.246 --> 01:23:21.247
Oh. really?

842
01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:23.416
Really.

843
01:23:33.677 --> 01:23:35.345
The end is near.

844
01:23:36.262 --> 01:23:37.472
witch hunter.

845
01:23:39.516 --> 01:23:44.396
I wish I could say
it would be painless. but that

846
01:23:45.230 --> 01:23:47.190
would be a lie.

847
01:23:54.489 --> 01:23:55.573
Get away from him.

848
01:23:57.075 --> 01:23:59.327
Always funny seeing
a white witch with a wand.

849
01:24:01.287 --> 01:24:04.207
What are you going to do?
Hit me with your love spell?

850
01:24:08.086 --> 01:24:09.587
Not bad.

851
01:24:15.593 --> 01:24:19.097
Sacrificing yourself to save a human.

852
01:24:19.764 --> 01:24:21.015
Pathetic.

853
01:24:26.604 --> 01:24:28.356
No!

854
01:24:34.696 --> 01:24:36.281
Mina. Hey.

855
01:24:36.823 --> 01:24:38.032
Come here.

856
01:24:41.953 --> 01:24:43.288
Hansel.

857
01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:48.084
Hansel.

858
01:24:48.835 --> 01:24:50.336
I tried to stop her.

859
01:24:50.587 --> 01:24:52.797
You did. You did good.

860
01:24:54.257 --> 01:24:55.759
You did good.

861
01:25:01.264 --> 01:25:04.017
I want you to do something for me.

862
01:25:05.643 --> 01:25:06.978
Anything.

863
01:25:11.566 --> 01:25:14.027
Kill the fucking bitch.

864
01:25:41.638 --> 01:25:43.890
You got to be fucking kidding me.

865
01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:50.915
Oh. please.

866
01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.333
Please?

867
01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.043
Please. stop.

868
01:26:55.587 --> 01:26:56.921
Please.

869
01:26:57.046 --> 01:26:58.089
Yeah. nice try.

870
01:28:03.363 --> 01:28:05.156
I fucking hate you.

871
01:28:05.823 --> 01:28:09.410
You know. you look like shit.

872
01:28:09.494 --> 01:28:10.495
You know that?

873
01:28:12.413 --> 01:28:13.581
So do you.

874
01:28:37.605 --> 01:28:38.773
Finish her already.

875
01:29:06.259 --> 01:29:08.886
<i>Revenge doesn't change the past.</i>

876
01:29:13.057 --> 01:29:15.101
<i>It won't bring our parents back.</i>

877
01:29:15.435 --> 01:29:17.395
- You all right?
- Oh. yeah.

878
01:29:17.812 --> 01:29:19.480
Glad to hear it.

879
01:29:20.148 --> 01:29:21.607
<i>But it sure as hell feels good.</i>

880
01:29:25.319 --> 01:29:27.739
<i>My sister and I know the truth.</i>

881
01:29:29.574 --> 01:29:31.576
<i>We know who we are now.</i>

882
01:29:33.453 --> 01:29:34.871
<i>And so do they.</i>

883
01:29:37.373 --> 01:29:39.208
<i>They know our story.</i>

884
01:29:39.959 --> 01:29:41.461
<i>our powers.</i>

885
01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.463
<i>what we can do.</i>

886
01:29:45.715 --> 01:29:47.383
<i>And they should fear us.</i>

887
01:29:50.636 --> 01:29:51.679
<i>All of us.</i>

888
01:29:52.055 --> 01:29:53.973
We should be getting close now.

889
01:29:54.098 --> 01:29:56.559
And so after this next one.
we've got three more to go.

890
01:29:56.684 --> 01:30:00.146
Three? You said three more
three witches ago.

891
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:02.607
Come on. you always say.
more witches. more money. right?

892
01:30:02.732 --> 01:30:04.567
Yeah. but you ain't getting any of it.

893
01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:06.027
Unless you want to pull the cart.

894
01:30:08.196 --> 01:30:09.655
Right. big guy?

895
01:30:09.822 --> 01:30:10.948
I told you he'd come in handy.

896
01:30:12.742 --> 01:30:15.078
<i>There are good witches in the world.</i>

897
01:30:15.745 --> 01:30:17.413
<i>We know that now.</i>

898
01:30:18.247 --> 01:30:21.834
<i>But for the ones practicing
the black arts. beware.</i>

899
01:30:21.918 --> 01:30:23.628
<i>We're coming for you.</i>

900
01:30:24.337 --> 01:30:27.173
<i>No matter where you are. we'll find you.</i>

901
01:30:28.841 --> 01:30:30.593
<i>And dead or alive.</i>

902
01:30:31.677 --> 01:30:33.054
<i>we'll take you down.</i>

903
01:30:33.179 --> 01:30:35.848
Edward. want to knock?

904
01:30:35.932 --> 01:30:37.308
<i>My vote:</i>

905
01:30:37.725 --> 01:30:38.851
<i>Dead.</i>

906
01:31:05.002 --> 01:31:08.381
I hate to break it to you.
but it's not gonna be an open casket.

907
01:31:11.381 --> 01:31:15.381
