Right. right. there. there.

We love you.

Lindsey. come here baby.

14
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.570
Can you wave to the
camera and wave to mommy?

15
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.340
Blow me a kiss. blow me a kiss.

16
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.180
- [James] Here she is.

17
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.140
Look at you. honey.

18
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.600
Honey. this is so good.

19
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.350
Hey. babe. hey. gang.

20
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.130
- Can mommy have a kiss?

21
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.860
That tastes like potato chips.

22
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.990
- Well. aren't we just
the perfect little family.

23
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.650
- I love you. honey.

24
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.170
I love you.

25
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.780
- Sayonara. sweetheart.

26
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.860
- James picking you up?

27
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.350
- Nope Lena is.

28
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.230
He's in a meeting tonight.

29
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.940
- When are the three of us
getting together for a session?

30
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.170
- I'm trying he still won't talk

31
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.830
with me. not with you. not with anybody.

32
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.710
- [Doctor] Keep working on it.

33
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.310
He just needs a little more time.

34
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.430
- [Sandy] I know.

35
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.840
- So I think you're
coming along very well.

36
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.380
- Thank you.

37
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.470
(suspenseful music)

38
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.270
There she is right on cue.

39
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.130
Thanks. doc.

40
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.050
- Bye. bye.

41
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.860
Dammit.

42
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.090
(suspenseful music)

43
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.610
James.

44
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.560
you surprised me.

45
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.090
- Sorry. doc. I didn't
mean to sneak up on you.

46
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.560
- What are you doing here?

47
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.740
- I was in the neighborhood

48
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.700
thought I'd come by and pick up Sandy.

49
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.220
- Well. you just missed her.

50
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.680
But now that I have you here

51
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.870
we need to set something
up for the three of us

52
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.250
long overdue actually.

53
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.910
Let's see how about

54
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.020
Thursday evening?

55
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.860
- Well. I'll have to
talk to Sandy about that.

56
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.190
- I'm putting Thursday down.

57
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.350
How you holding up. James?

58
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.890
- Some days are worse than others.

59
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.940
- Well. have Sandy give me a call

60
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.360
about Thursday. don't forget.

61
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.830
(suspenseful music)

62
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.790
James.

63
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.120
Why?

64
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.120
- Thursday doesn't work for me. doc.

65
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.920
- [David] Come on. mom.
but I went last year.

66
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.930
I don't understand why
this year's different.

67
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.780
- [Sandy] David. we've been
over this a hundred times.

68
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.870
The answer is no.

69
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.350
- [David] The whole team's going.

70
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.280
- [Sandy] Without any adult supervision?

71
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.960
- [David] Nikky's brother's 12.

72
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.330
- [Sandy] 12 that makes
all the difference.

73
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.260
I'm so relieved.

74
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.090
- [David] Come on. mom.

75
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.150
- Yeah. come on mom.

76
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.750
- [David] Dodgers Angels.

77
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.330
- [Sandy] Not without an adult.

78
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.070
Don't give me a hard time here. David.

79
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.060
- Then stop treating me like a baby.

80
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.670
You're ruining my life. mom.

81
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.450
- That's what they pay me for big guy.

82
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.190
- No. really I mean you're so afraid

83
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.970
that something's gonna happen to me.

84
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.320
I'm not supposed to grow up
scared of my shadow. mom.

85
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.240
Look it up.

86
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.080
Ever since Lindsey...

87
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.670
(somber music)

88
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.880
Sorry. mom.

89
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.330
- It's okay.

90
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.880
Honey. I know it's been hard on all of us.

91
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.720
- Blah. blah.

92
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.670
- [Sandy] How about if I talk to dad

93
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.350
and maybe he can go with you?

94
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.140
- Excellent.

95
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.310
- Be good for both of you.

96
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.820
- [] Thanks. mom.

97
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.540
- Knock. knock.

98
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.110
- You scared me.

99
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.400
- Doing a lot of that tonight.

100
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.860
- You're late.

101
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.690
- I'm a busy guy.

102
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.110
- Well. I don't like it when you're late.

103
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.670
Hey. did I say you could stop?

104
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.420
- Hey. Schwartz. listen it's in the bag.

105
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.050
Yeah. my mom said that
she'll ask dad to take us.

106
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.760
He'll say yes.

107
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.690
Don't worry.

108
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.490
He always says yes.

109
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.660
Your sister she's so ugly.

110
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.910
- You know that kid's a spoiled brat.

111
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.760
You're gonna have to straighten him out.

112
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.890
How did it go?

113
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.930
- A minor complication.

114
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.230
- Yeah.
- No problem.

115
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.370
- Why do we even have to bother?

116
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.130
I mean don't we know enough about her.

117
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.910
She's the perfect woman.

118
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.820
Yawn. yawn.

119
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.840
- I told you we needed to
know everything and now we do.

120
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.760
- [Beth] You know the only
thing keeping me awake

121
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.250
at night is Victor.

122
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.090
He's not the type of guy to
just walk away from 50 grand.

123
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.170
- [Max] You worry too much come here.

124
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.580
- I hate this dump.

125
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.630
When are we getting out of here?

126
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.150
- Soon.

127
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.650
- This gonna work?

128
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.960
Tell me this is gonna work.

129
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.890
- Like a charm.

130
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.390
It's full proof.

131
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.550
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

132
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.800
Come here.

133
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.610
(dramatic music)

134
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.380
- Look. mommy. look it's broken.

135
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.270
- Oh. Lindsey.

136
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.180
(Sandy screaming)

137
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.980
- Sandy. Sandy it's okay.

138
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.240
It's okay. it's okay.

139
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.580
- (sobbing) I miss her.

140
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.320
- I miss her too.

141
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.020
- Your meeting ran late?

142
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.540
- Yeah. well. you know
how these meetings go.

143
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.040
Everybody's trying to out smart each other

144
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.260
it's like a Mensa convention.

145
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.490
- Honey. David misses you.

146
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.070
- David misses you.

147
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.770
- Dammit. Sandy.

148
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.470
I had auditors in all week long.

149
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.760
- It's not just this week.

150
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.270
- I know look can we talk
about this another time?

151
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.190
I got a lot on my mind right now.

152
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.880
- I know you do. James. you always do.

153
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.300
We never talk about anything that counts.

154
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.210
You can't keep everything
bottled up inside you forever.

155
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.040
You can't do it alone.

156
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.050
- Yes. I can.

157
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.730
- [Sandy] James. please.

158
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.400
You don't even know what
he does for a living.

159
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.710
- You think he's a criminal mastermind?

160
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.730
You're right about one thing

161
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.770
Roman is a naughty boy
sometimes but just we me.

162
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.680
- I don't know 40-year old naughty boys

163
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.910
with money to burn make me nervous.

164
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.000
- Easy for you to say you
have man of your dream.

165
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.410
- Beautiful morning. isn't it?

166
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.360
- If you are saying so.

167
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.070
- Hey. mom.

168
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.240
- Hi.
- Hi. dad.

169
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.740
Good morning. Lena.
- Morning.

170
00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.190
- Lena rings a good morning we don't?

171
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.280
- She's European they're more formal.

172
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.800
- Excuse me. excuse me. excuse me.

173
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.260
- You gonna sit down. Sandy.

174
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.580
(horn honking)

175
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.500
- God. there's Toni already.

176
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.150
You make sure you eat
some of that omelet. okay?

177
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.400
- [David] Okay.

178
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.560
- You be good. love you.

179
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.140
Love you guys. bye.

180
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.520
- Is mom ever gonna drive again?

181
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.400
- Sure she is kiddo.

182
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.180
She just needs a little
more time that's all.

183
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.700
(soft music)

184
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.300
(telephone ringing)

185
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.450
- Coast Pacific Development.

186
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.660
- [Caller] Mr. Kennington please.

187
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.490
- No. no sir.

188
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.280
Mr. Coulson. he hasn't come in yet.

189
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.760
Yes. sir I will just
as soon as he gets in.

190
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.130
- Thanks.
- Okay.

191
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.760
- God. look at my knee.

192
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.780
- What happened to you?

193
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.320
- Some creep darn near
ran me off the road.

194
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.790
- That'll teach you to
run through the canyon

195
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.180
during morning rush.

196
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.670
- We all hurt. Wendy.

197
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.810
- Is he in yet with. Beth?

198
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.370
- Nope.
- Good morning. ladies.

199
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.200
- Good morning.

200
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.880
- Coulson called it's urgent.

201
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.120
- Beth. can I have a--

202
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.730
- Cream two sugars.

203
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.650
- Thank you.
- Yes. sir.

204
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.840
- Wendy. do you have those--

205
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.060
- Here. sir.
- Thank you.

206
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.570
Can I ask you something?

207
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.810
- [James] Absolutely.

208
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.660
- Well. you shoot Monday.
babe. make me proud.

209
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.340
- [Bobby] Sandy. you are the best.

210
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.530
- Yeah. you owe me too.

211
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.280
- Bye.
- Bye.

212
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.080
- Another shared commission?

213
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.470
- So you got a better ever suggestion?

214
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.710
Look Bobby's paid his dues.

215
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.830
He's a great photographer.

216
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.220
Toni. he's gonna make
a killing in New York.

217
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.890
- So would you.

218
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.800
- Yeah. but my life's here remember?

219
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.870
(cellphone ringing)
Saved by the bell.

220
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:59.970
Sandy Kennington.

221
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.540
- [Sally] This is Sally
from Dr. Silverstone.

222
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.750
(somber music)

223
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.710
- Oh. my god.

224
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.550
- [sally] Mugged last night.

225
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.050
- Yeah. thank you.

226
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.740
- What's wrong?

227
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.640
- Dr. Silverstone

228
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.370
he was mugged last night.

229
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.180
He's dead.

230
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.630
- That's a very fair offer. Peter.

231
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.760
Yes. I understand.

232
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.420
That's again. Peter.

233
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.030
- Good news from Coulson.?

234
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.450
- Listen to this.

235
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.140
18 million.

236
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.260
The offer's off the table next Friday.

237
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.970
- You know in two years this company

238
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.570
could be worth 25. 30 million.

239
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.680
- It's not just the money. Jerry.

240
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.410
It's whether or not I could
actually walk out of this place

241
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:59.490
and never come back again
I mean could I do that?

242
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.120
I don't know.

243
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.670
(telephone ringing)

244
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:04.680
Yes.

245
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.340
- [Beth] Mr. Kennington. it's your wife.

246
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.000
It sounds important.

247
00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.260
- Hi. honey.
- James.

248
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.350
(suspenseful music)

249
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.750
He's dead.

250
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.170
- When'd you find out?

251
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.230
- [Sandy] They just called.

252
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.390
- [Beth] So we only have
till the end of this week.

253
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.040
- I don't like deadlines.

254
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.620
- Well. we got one.

255
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.200
- Well. then we're gonna
have to revise our schedule.

256
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.990
It'll have to be tomorrow night.

257
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.720
You're gonna be ready?

258
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.970
(Beth giggling)

259
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.720
- You know that I'm always ready.

260
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.040
(dramatic music)

261
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:56.940
- Coffee.

262
00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.980
- You're a mind reader.

263
00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.500
- Yeah. I wish I was.

264
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.830
- Hell of a day.

265
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.820
- Yeah.

266
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.100
Coulson's offer you tempted?

267
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.470
- [James] I don't know
Jerry thinks if I wait

268
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.420
a few more years I could make more money.

269
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.720
- I'll take the 18 mill
thank you very much.

270
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.430
- What are your thoughts?

271
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.260
- It's a tough one for you

272
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.580
letting go of something you love.

273
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.940
It's a great opportunity. James.

274
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.790
Total freedom.

275
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.620
You wouldn't have to work anymore.

276
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.160
- Maybe that's not what I want.

277
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.330
Maybe my work is the only
thing that's keeping me sane.

278
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.870
Sandy.

279
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.010
I'm doing the best I can.

280
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.370
- Where?

281
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.240
- What do you mean where?

282
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.970
- Where are you doing
the best you can. James?

283
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:02.100
Not with David you missed
his last three games.

284
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.750
Sure not with me.

285
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.210
I miss you.

286
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.820
I've had more dinners alone
than I care to count. James.

287
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.930
You never even tried once
with Dr. Silverstone.

288
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.040
Face it all you do you just
hide out in your office.

289
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.760
- You're facing reality head on?

290
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.330
- Well. at least I'm trying.

291
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:19.410
- Oh. really.

292
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.960
- That's not fair.

293
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:31.770
- Sandy.

294
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.930
Yes. it's an unhappy situation
but that's not the point.

295
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.280
Claire. Claire. listen.

296
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.780
Listen to me.

297
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.310
No. no. you do not wanna do that.

298
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.640
No. not tonight.

299
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.240
How about tomorrow?

300
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.620
Four o'clock.
- Where?

301
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.870
- Serge's.

302
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:55.890
- You'll be there?
- Yes.

303
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.350
- You promise. James?

304
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.930
- Yes. yes I will see you then.

305
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.690
All right.

306
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.050
- I'll see you there.
- All right.

307
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.380
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

308
00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.450
(dramatic music)

309
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.670
Damn.

310
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.500
- We had such a big fight last night.

311
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.520
- Who won?

312
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.350
- We both lost.

313
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.520
- At least you're talking.

314
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.780
- I'm not connecting.

315
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.540
- Listen sweetie I know much
you two love each other.

316
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.380
Maybe you both should
stop working for a while.

317
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.190
I don't know take a trip.

318
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.450
Have some quiet time together.

319
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.530
He'll snap out of it.

320
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.330
- I hope so.

321
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.460
When do we get your new car?

322
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.710
- It's coming. it's coming.

323
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.840
- Good night. Beth.
- Night.

324
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.170
- Have a good one.
- You too.

325
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.310
(suspenseful music)

326
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.550
Crystal.

327
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.640
you're working pretty late tonight. huh?

328
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.450
- Yeah. my former pal
Jerry dumped this on me

329
00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.960
at the last second.

330
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.100
- You need some help or something?

331
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.190
- No. it'll take me longer
to explain it than to do it.

332
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.670
Thanks any ways.

333
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.410
- Alright. well just give me
a yell if you need anything.

334
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.830
- [Crystal] Okay.

335
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.310
- Jerry should have that
information at his fingertips.

336
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.410
Listen. Greg I'll really running late.

337
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.940
Why don't you just give
Jerry a call in the morning.

338
00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.270
Yeah. okay. bye.

339
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.700
Night. Beth.

340
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.530
- Night.

341
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.180
(suspenseful music)

342
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.490
- [Female] Mr. Styles office.

343
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.800
- Hi. I'm calling for Mr. Kennington.

344
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.720
- Yes. may I help you.

345
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.420
- Yes. he won't be able to
make his appointment tonight

346
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.430
because his car broke down
on the freeway near the

347
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.770
Chadsworth site.

348
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.880
(suspenseful music)

349
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.930
- Long time no see.

350
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.600
- I'll call and reschedule.
- Beth is James still here?

351
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.570
- [Beth] No. he just left.

352
00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.900
- Darn I need to ask him some questions.

353
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.580
- Crystal. listen.

354
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.340
Could you just give this to him for me?

355
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.910
You know you probably missed him anyway.

356
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.250
- That's okay I'll catch up.

357
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.490
Mr. Kennington.

358
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.750
- Crystal. what are you doing here?

359
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.130
- I'm so glad I caught you.

360
00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.650
I need to ask you a question
about the Ventura specs.

361
00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.620
Jerry is meeting with them first thing.

362
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.880
(loud thud)
(loud grunting)

363
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.880
What's that?

364
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.120
- What?

365
00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.690
- Somebody's in there.

366
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.180
- What are you talking about?

367
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.590
- What's making that noise?

368
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.550
(suspenseful music)

369
00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.300
- Crystal. come here.

370
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.630
- [Crystal] Beth. what.

371
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.840
(neck cracking)

372
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:11.490
- Beth. don't just stand there.

373
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.000
Open the car door.

374
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.930
(loud banging)

375
00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.260
You are not going girly
girl on me are you?

376
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.220
Now look you're gonna go back in there

377
00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.630
get her purse and her
bike get back in the Jeep

378
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.960
and meet me at the house you understand?

379
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.950
- What are you gonna do with the body?

380
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.230
- Riding a bike through
the canyons at night

381
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.450
is a dangerous thing to do.

382
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.700
Now get moving.

383
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:35.870
Beth. get moving.

384
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.000
(suspenseful music)

385
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.660
My compliments to your tailor.

386
00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.400
- Jesus. Beth. what's going on here?

387
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.570
- Mr. Kennington. say hello to
your long lost twin brother.

388
00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.570
- Say hi.

389
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.740
And then only speak when
spoken to understand?

390
00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:13.660
- Fuck you.

391
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.640
(suspenseful music)

392
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.670
- You wanna say that to your wife and kid?

393
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:28.690
Now say hi.

394
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.470
- Hi.

395
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.020
- God these family reunions
give me the goose bumps.

396
00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.830
- I bet you you're surprised.

397
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.700
I mean I know I was.

398
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.420
Up until a year ago I
thought I was the only me.

399
00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.880
Then the woman that adopted me died.

400
00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.580
She was a whore.

401
00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.750
queen of the $20 blow job and a drunk.

402
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.540
She died last year.

403
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.310
They left me out of Lompoc early

404
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.810
so I could attend her funeral.

405
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.780
Guess what I found out
when I was going through

406
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.050
dear old adopted mom's
pathetic belongings?

407
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.370
I found I was not alone
in this unforgiving

408
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.620
knee in the ball's world.

409
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.050
I found you my brother.

410
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.860
Turns out I'm two minutes older than you.

411
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.030
So I guess you'll be coming
to me with your problems.

412
00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.750
Shh.

413
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.190
Naturally I was curious
I mean were you alive.

414
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.510
and if you were how did you turn out?

415
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:39.590
Guess what I found out
after exhaustive research?

416
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.710
I'm speaking to you.

417
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.530
- I thought the question was rhetorical.

418
00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:49.620
- Rhetorical.

419
00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.300
You see that. Beth.

420
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.380
You see that.

421
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.560
He gets to grow up in a big house

422
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.210
in sunny California with loving parents

423
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.040
actual pillars of the community.

424
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.630
Goes to the best schools money can buy

425
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.350
so that he can use a word like rhetorical

426
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.580
as casually as I tie my
shoes in the morning.

427
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.240
He's now wealthy man

428
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:20.300
living in an even bigger
house with the perfect wife.

429
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.130
which brings us to our present situation.

430
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.160
You see. dear brother.
although you have been

431
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.870
waffling about the sale of your company

432
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:31.170
you are about to grow some
balls and make a decision.

433
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.120
Hey. you've worked hard.

434
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.870
Time to cash in. right?

435
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.020
Lead the good life.

436
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.970
- They'll know you're not me.

437
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.930
- My son David plays
first base for the Oriels.

438
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.390
He's got a good glove
could use a little work

439
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.300
in the batting cage.

440
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.580
He's got a scar on his but

441
00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.860
that he got from falling on a rake

442
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.840
when he was three years old.

443
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.080
I keep a pair of bifocals in
the bottom of my desk at work

444
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.310
because it's getting more
difficult to read the fine print.

445
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.060
and I always read the fine print.

446
00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.810
My lovely wife. Sandy

447
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.690
hasn't driven a car in over a year.

448
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.480
Dear departed Dr.
Silverstone has concluded

449
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.390
that she blames herself
for the tragic death

450
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.310
of our daughter Lindsey in a car accident.

451
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.390
Need I go on?

452
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.930
- How do you know about Silverstone?

453
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:30.830
- Because I know everything.

454
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.960
- Just leave my family alone.

455
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.880
- There's no need for
anyone else to get hurt

456
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.630
as long as we can depend
on your cooperation.

457
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.410
Wish me luck. brother.

458
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.450
(dramatic music)

459
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.490
Are we clear?

460
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.420
- About what?

461
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.940
- About the plan. Beth.

462
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.720
- Crystal wasn't a part of the plan.

463
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.940
- It was your responsibility
to keep Crystal and the others

464
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.360
clear of the parking lot
and you didn't do that

465
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.340
so we had to kill her
and that's tough luck.

466
00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.460
Now if anyone else shows up

467
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.940
we're gonna have to take care of them.

468
00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.780
- We?

469
00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.310
- That's right you and me

470
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.040
partners in crime. bad to the bone.

471
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.150
- We can't just go killing
everybody that gets in our way.

472
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:24.630
- Yes. we can Beth.

473
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.220
Yes. we can.

474
00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.020
Now you listen to me.

475
00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.740
All of my life I have had dreams

476
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.070
and not a chance in hell
of them ever coming true.

477
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.610
Now God. providence. for
all I know the fucking

478
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.160
Easter Bunny has dropped
a fortune in our lap.

479
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.640
I'm not about to blow it because
we're not willing to make

480
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:43.470
an adjustment or two because
the situation calls for it.

481
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.450
A million dollars can buy
a lot of dreams. Beth.

482
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.060
(suspenseful music)

483
00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:51.900
So.

484
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.780
what are we gonna do with
Mr. Businessman Of The Year?

485
00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.950
- We kill him.

486
00:25:58.930 --> 00:25:59.890
- And?

487
00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.940
- And bury the body where
nobody will find it.

488
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.440
- And with me playing James.
loving husband and father

489
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.920
the Kennington family goes
on an extended vacation.

490
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.090
While the Kennington's
are on top of some fucking

491
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.290
mountain top in Turkey or
exploring some jungle temple

492
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.800
down in Mexico what happens then. Beth?

493
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.190
It's important for me to know

494
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.630
that you have it clear in your
mind what's happening next.

495
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:22.780
- You're hurting me. Max.

496
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.280
- What happens to the wife and the kid?

497
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.310
- They have an accident.

498
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.390
(suspenseful music)

499
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.280
- Tell me again why we're doing this.

500
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.110
- The money.

501
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.840
- No. not for the money.

502
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.090
For what the money can do

503
00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.490
because when you're rich you're somebody.

504
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:43.160
You and I are gonna be somebody.

505
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.440
Are we clear?

506
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.090
(door slamming closed)

507
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.880
- Evening. Mr. K.

508
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.720
- Lena.

509
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.670
You look nice.

510
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:48.570
- Thank you.

511
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.580
- Going to a party tonight?

512
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.080
- Caribbean dance.

513
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.400
- With Roman?

514
00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.530
- Don't you start with him.

515
00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.490
Mr. K. David's doing
sleep over at Kenny's.

516
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.950
- Good.

517
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.180
(suspenseful music)

518
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.560
- You're home.

519
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:49.540
- Here I am.

520
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.370
Me.

521
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.500
Home at last.

522
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.620
- Hi.

523
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.180
- I'm sorry about last night.

524
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.540
- We both said things we shouldn't have.

525
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.560
- And I didn't say things I should have

526
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.180
about the business.

527
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.910
Silverstone.

528
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:11.740
David.

529
00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:14.240
us.

530
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.850
- I've been thinking. James. that

531
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.190
maybe you feel as long as you hurt inside

532
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:25.350
as long as you keep
your grief private that

533
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.390
somehow Lindsey will stay with you.

534
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.300
- I think you're right.

535
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:33.210
- Champagne.

536
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.760
- To celebrate the first time
we laid eyes on each other.

537
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.980
- Watch yourself. pal.
the walls have ears.

538
00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.480
- April 22. 1990.

539
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.370
that horrible garden party in Brentwood.

540
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.410
- That wasn't the first time.

541
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.540
- What?
(tense music)

542
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.430
- You're wrong.

543
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.540
- We were introduced by that
city council guy Schlimer.

544
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.960
I sent him a thank you note the next day.

545
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.420
- [Sandy] That's not when it was.

546
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.880
- Don't you fucking do this to me.

547
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.210
- March 4. 1990.

548
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.180
First time I ever set eyes on you.

549
00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.510
You remember that charity
thing at the Four Seasons

550
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.840
cystic fibrosis?

551
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.340
- This is not part of the fucking plan.

552
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.350
(loud banging)

553
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:34.520
- So you gonna take off your
jacket and stay a while?

554
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.670
(soft music)

555
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.970
- I would've remembered you.

556
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.410
- I didn't say you saw me.

557
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:48.660
Said I saw you.

558
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.230
- Luckiest day of my life
and I didn't even know it.

559
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.230
- I knew it.

560
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.110
(loud banging)

561
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.920
- [Beth] Son of a bitch I can't
believe you did this to me.

562
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.760
I can't.

563
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.250
(tense music)

564
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.480
(thunder roaring)

565
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.070
- I was thinking about the business.

566
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.480
Maybe selling is a good idea.

567
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.640
The time is right. Sandy.

568
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.070
- That's a big decision.

569
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.550
- I was thinking it
might be healthy for us

570
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.990
to get out of here for a while.

571
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:45.240
Go traveling wherever you want

572
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.140
and in the fall we can try New York

573
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.300
see how we like it.

574
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.290
I know that's always
been a dream of yours.

575
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.320
- Really New York?

576
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.150
- Why not?

577
00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.740
- What about David?

578
00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.200
This isn't something we can do lightly.

579
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.830
I mean his life's in such
delicate balance now.

580
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.580
- David will be fine.

581
00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.520
Sandy. it can be a new start for us.

582
00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.770
(soft music)

583
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.930
- Let's talk to him.

584
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.230
About last night welcome home.

585
00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.090
- You're in my seat.

586
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.150
- Well. sit there.

587
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.990
You be the dad today.

588
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.330
- But that's where mom sits.

589
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.240
- Good morning everyone.

590
00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:31.700
Eat fast your bus is gonna
be here in 10 minutes.

591
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.800
That's strange. honey.

592
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.530
(suspenseful music)

593
00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.390
You haven't even opened the paper.

594
00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:43.650
I don't think I can remember a morning

595
00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:47.100
when you didn't skim the
headlines before you ate.

596
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.850
- I can't remember a
morning quite like this.

597
00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:02.280
- [Beth] So did you have a
good time last night. Maxy.

598
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.090
- Beth what are you talking about?

599
00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:05.640
- What am I talking about?

600
00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.080
What am I talking about?

601
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.190
I can hear the kid on the phone

602
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.910
talking to his stupid friends.

603
00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:12.250
I can hear Ms. Ukrainia
freaking yapping away.

604
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.840
- Beth. I don't have time for this.

605
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.650
- But the one conversation
that I wanna hear

606
00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.470
and the freaking bug goes dead.

607
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:20.760
Now I don't call that a coincidence.

608
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.630
You know what I call that?

609
00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:23.460
Fuck you.

610
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.340
(dramatic music)

611
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.990
- Give me a gun somebody
just give me a gun.

612
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:49.250
- What do you need a gun for. Wendy.

613
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:52.680
- To shoot myself with
of course bang. bang.

614
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.320
Beth a left a message on voicemail

615
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.660
saying that her mother
had an accident in Seattle

616
00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.040
or Vancouver or whatever.

617
00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.710
Did I mention to you that Crystal is late

618
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.670
and I tried to phone her.

619
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.500
I mean I just don't know

620
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.340
what to do anymore.
- Morning. James.

621
00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.180
- Good morning. Jerry.

622
00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.260
Good now that I've got you both here.

623
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:09.980
I've decided to sell.

624
00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.070
(dramatic music)

625
00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.070
- Shit.

626
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.720
- Hey. what a nice surprise
look who we have here?

627
00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.850
- Victor I--
- How you doing

628
00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.500
in the land of fruits and nuts?

629
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.520
- You know I'm just
passing through you know.

630
00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.560
I've got a job interview in Tulsa.

631
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.560
It's my mother's cousin.

632
00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.100
- Maxy with you?

633
00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.370
- Are you kidding.

634
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.200
That son of a bitch.

635
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.230
- If it were up to me.
I'd slice his apple.

636
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.730
What he done to us no respect.

637
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:16.670
- You know I heard he was up in Vallejo.

638
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:21.410
- That's a lot of groceries
there for one person.

639
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.550
- I got a new guy.

640
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.020
He's from around here.

641
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.690
He's a regular citizen.

642
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:31.150
- I thought you were just passing through.

643
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.160
(tense music)

644
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.410
Let's go meet the new fella.

645
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.290
- No. Victor I don't know where Max is.

646
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.860
Victor. I don't know where Max is.

647
00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.940
(suspenseful music)

648
00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:48.970
- So if you see Maxy.

649
00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:50.270
tell him that his friends upstate

650
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:53.600
will be real happy to know
that he's so close by.

651
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.270
I'll see you around.

652
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.290
(tense music)

653
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.180
- I would've bet anything
you were gonna say no.

654
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:28.420
- Let's just say I'm not the
same man I was yesterday.

655
00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.370
(cellphone ringing)
Jerry.

656
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:30.400
can you give me a moment?

657
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.400
- Sure. sure no problem.

658
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:36.410
- Jerry. let's fast track this thing.

659
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:39.050
- Okay.

660
00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:45.640
- What now. Beth?

661
00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.890
- Maxy. guess who I just ran into. huh?

662
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:54.890
- Victor.

663
00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:01.070
(dramatic music)

664
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.670
(loud grunting)

665
00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.410
- I hope you like day old Danish.

666
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:58.830
- No. Happy Meal?

667
00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:00.850
- Funny.

668
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.030
- I know this wasn't your idea. Beth.

669
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.040
- Yeah. and how do you know that?

670
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.450
- [James] Because I know you.

671
00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.230
- You don't know me.

672
00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:18.490
- I know you're not a killer.

673
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:20.740
- Hungry?

674
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:23.170
- Starving.

675
00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.450
It's not too late. Beth.

676
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.400
- I don't wanna talk about it.

677
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.400
- I mean it.

678
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.040
It's not too late to make things right.

679
00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.500
- I don't wanna talk
about it just shut up.

680
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.080
(tense music)

681
00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.370
- Do you love him?

682
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:14.750
- Yes.

683
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.420
Yes. I do all right.

684
00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.190
End of story and end of breakfast.

685
00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.880
- Beth. what's his name?

686
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.890
At least tell me his name.

687
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:28.720
- Max.

688
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.870
his name is Max

689
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.040
and now his name is James.

690
00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.760
- Okay. what do you think?

691
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.880
- It's cute.

692
00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.900
- Cute?

693
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.500
It's sexy.

694
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.420
So wanna give it a try?

695
00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:00.860
- Maybe tomorrow. thanks.

696
00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.820
You drive.
- Okay

697
00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:02.650
- Come on.
- Let's go.

698
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:05.240
I can't wait for you to see it.

699
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.700
- I had three martinis and a Mai Tais.

700
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.950
and I don't even drink.

701
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:19.180
I waited for you at Serge's
for an hour and 47 minutes

702
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.800
one hour and 47 minutes.

703
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.880
You know it's like to sit at a bar alone

704
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.380
for an hour and 47 minutes.

705
00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.350
- I'm sorry about Serge's.

706
00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:30.100
- You're sorry.

707
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.350
Yes. well did it slip your mind. James?

708
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:35.610
- No.

709
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.840
- Why are you looking at me like that?

710
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:44.590
James. you're just terrified of change.

711
00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:47.780
So was I but when you're in a bad marriage

712
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.380
it never gets any better.

713
00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.110
Mine's over.

714
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:52.940
I'm free.

715
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.530
- Excuse me.

716
00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.000
I have some more papers
for you to look over.

717
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.570
- Jerry have you met--

718
00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:02.400
- Claire.

719
00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.790
- [Jerry] Ogden. Jerry Ogden.

720
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:13.070
- Well. Mr. Kennington. thank
you for being so generous.

721
00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.120
Please say hello to Mrs.
Kennington for me. won't you?

722
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.220
Excuse me.

723
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:26.880
Sandy. right?
- Yes. Sandy.

724
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.650
- Well. if Sandy has any questions

725
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:31.400
I can be reached at the Woodlawn.

726
00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.960
Or perhaps I should try calling her?

727
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.250
- No. I don't think you should do that.

728
00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:39.590
- Well. I wouldn't want it
to slip your mind again.

729
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:42.180
(tense music)

730
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.200
- Fundraiser Bel Air Modern Dance

731
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.450
one of Sandy's friends gave her a name.

732
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:54.500
- Pretty.

733
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:56.550
- Who is she?

734
00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:00.990
- Her name is Claire Andrews.

735
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:03.600
- She certainly couldn't be your mistress.

736
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.430
A man with a wife like Sandy

737
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:08.040
would have no need for a mistress.

738
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.240
- Are you lecturing me on morality?

739
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.010
- Yeah. Max. you
lecturing him on morality?

740
00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:14.980
- Shut the fuck up and
do your nails. Beth.

741
00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.350
You should've known about Claire.

742
00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:21.510
My own brother Mr. Straight
and Narrow an adulterer.

743
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.820
I looked up to you.

744
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:29.240
Once again who is she?

745
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.490
Before you respond consider this.

746
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:38.030
Your beautiful wife and
your promising young son

747
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:40.700
would beg you to be truthful.

748
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.780
(suspenseful music)

749
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.770
- After Lindsey died.

750
00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:49.940
Sandy I hadn't been close.

751
00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.370
We had a terrible fight
before I left to San Francisco

752
00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:55.000
on business I thought
it was over between us.

753
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.330
I wasn't myself.

754
00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.710
I ran into Claire at a function.

755
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.680
We'd been lovers once before Sandy.

756
00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.160
- And one thing just led to another.

757
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.710
- It just happened.

758
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:11.260
- Give me a break.

759
00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.660
- I had to do something she kept calling

760
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.750
sometimes two or three times a day.

761
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:18.380
She threatened to go to
Sandy if I didn't see her.

762
00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.050
I had to do something to end it.

763
00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.470
- How was I supposed to know?

764
00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.210
- That important thing
that she had to tell you.

765
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.550
She's divorced.

766
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:36.420
and guess who she's got
lined up as a replacement.

767
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.840
- There's a solution.

768
00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:38.800
- I'm all ears.

769
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.020
- Money you want money I've got money.

770
00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.720
We'll make a deal everybody's happy.

771
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.800
I'll take care of Claire.

772
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.520
So how much is it gonna cost?

773
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.580
- That money that you're making deals with

774
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.250
it's my money now.

775
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:57.840
(tense music)

776
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:02.580
- We gotta get out of the here Maxy.

777
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.480
You know those guys with Victor

778
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.150
they scare me worse than he does.

779
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:06.380
I mean what if they find us?

780
00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.590
- They won't if you pay attention.

781
00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.810
- You know what I've
been thinking about this.

782
00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.130
I've been thinking about it a lot.

783
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.340
Now James already offered us money. right

784
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.320
I'll bet you we could get like

785
00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.460
two million right now no waiting.

786
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.510
You know what I say we take it

787
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:19.740
and get on a freaking plane--

788
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.540
- Would you shut the
hell up and listen to me?

789
00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.170
We're not taking two million dollars

790
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:27.100
when there's 18 million out
there with our name on it.

791
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.200
We're gonna keep on doing
exactly what we have been doing

792
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.960
with one exception you
do not leave this house.

793
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.210
You understand?
- Maxy I'll go nuts.

794
00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.080
- Do you understand?

795
00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.830
Now you listen to me.

796
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:42.150
We'll get out of here quick as we can.

797
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.320
- You and Mrs. Kennington and the kid?

798
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.830
- With you following close behind.

799
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.310
- Did you see her naked Maxy?

800
00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:50.740
- Huh?

801
00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.410
- She as good as me?

802
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.200
Did she do all those special
little things you like?

803
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.890
- What the hell are you talking about?

804
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:59.970
- You know what I think

805
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:04.220
I think you like being
Mr. James Kennington.

806
00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.380
I think you like every little
bit about it especially her.

807
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.810
(door slamming)

808
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.980
(car engine revving)

809
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.890
- Can I be excused?

810
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.140
- [Sandy] Sure.

811
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:31.280
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. sit here kiddo.

812
00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.150
- I have homework.

813
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:34.980
- Want some ice cream?

814
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:38.900
- You guys are getting a divorce right?

815
00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.370
- No. honey.

816
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:42.840
- We're a family and
we'll always be a family.

817
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.510
But we do have news.

818
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:46.900
- Exciting news.

819
00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.910
- Gross you guys are pregnant?

820
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:52.740
- No.

821
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.130
- David. how would you like
to do some traveling and then

822
00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:59.690
maybe this fall we'd thought
we'd take a place in New York?

823
00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:02.120
You'll love New York.
everybody loves New York.

824
00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.710
- No. thanks can I go now. mom?

825
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:06.500
- Sure.

826
00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:12.360
Gee. that went well.

827
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:20.760
(tense music)

828
00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.880
(soft knocking)

829
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:34.710
- Hi. mom.

830
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.090
- Hi.

831
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:41.340
- Can't talk right now I have homework.

832
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.790
- You know something

833
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:48.920
sometimes people just need
a change of scenery. David.

834
00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.540
- We need to stay here. mom.

835
00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.600
I mean all my friends are here.

836
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.240
I signed up for baseball.

837
00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.080
- I know.

838
00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.910
- Summer camp and football in the fall.

839
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.740
I even like my school.

840
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.630
- Okay.

841
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:06.270
Look I'm not trying to talk
you into anything you don't

842
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:10.460
wanna do I'm just asking
you to think about it. okay?

843
00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.100
- Okay. I'll think about it.

844
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:12.930
- Thanks.

845
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.550
- Okay. I thought about it.

846
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:18.570
I still don't wanna go.

847
00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:19.400
- You.

848
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.170
(David giggling)

849
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:23.760
(tense music)

850
00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.330
No luck.

851
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.590
- He'll change his mind.

852
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:37.400
- I don't think so.

853
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.260
- We go he goes that is it.

854
00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:40.980
- No. that's not it.

855
00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.100
What's wrong with you?

856
00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.680
We're not gonna force David to go anymore.

857
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.230
He's been through enough.

858
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.440
Just give him a little time

859
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.580
to get used to the idea. okay?

860
00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.160

861
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:11.370

I'll see you there tonight about 8:30.

873
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:59.280
Claire. I've been thinking about things.

874
00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:02.660
We'll talk about it tonight.

875
00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.820
Alright goodbye.

876
00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.070
- [Claire] Bye.

877
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.150
- These guys are so eager to close.

878
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:12.530
We could've gotten more.

879
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:14.750
- Well. let's not get greedy. Jerry.

880
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:16.340
- All we need are the stock certificates

881
00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:19.730
and it's a keeper signed of course.

882
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:21.280
- Of course.

883
00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.170
- The lawyer says you have them.

884
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:26.650
- Yeah. I'll take care of it.

885
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:27.490
- Okay.

886
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.580
(tense music)

887
00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:37.920
- I'll take care of everything.

888
00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:47.250
- Beth.

889
00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.340
You really think he's
gonna share with you?

890
00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:58.080
The man is conning everybody.

891
00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:58.910
- Not me.

892
00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:01.780
He loves me.

893
00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.740
- You know what I think?

894
00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:19.710
- You know really I don't
care what you think.

895
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.920
- I think once he has the money

896
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.920
once he kills all of us

897
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:30.760
the one remaining thing for
him to do is cash you in.

898
00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.260
Trade up for a classier model.

899
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.520
Is that what you were fighting
about the other night. Beth?

900
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.840
Is it. Beth?

901
00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:49.690
(tense music)

902
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.170
(telephone ringing)

903
00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:07.540
- Yeah.

904
00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:10.960
- I told you we needed to keep him alive.

905
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.310
- Hey.

906
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:19.440
Drop the pipe.

907
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.840
Alright now get up.

908
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.340
Real slow.

909
00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:35.480
I got some stock certificates
I gotta talk to you about.

910
00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:52.970
(dramatic music)

911
00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:15.050
(locks engaging)

912
00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.800
(tense music)

913
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:10.520
(suspenseful music)

914
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:29.230
(chaining jingling)

915
00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:55.080
- [Sandy] I thought I heard you down here.

916
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.160
- Hi. stock certificates Jerry needs.

917
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:06.640
I'm sorry about last night.

918
00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.610
I know David will come
around in his own time.

919
00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:12.460
- Maybe after the summer. huh?

920
00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:15.840
He's just so excited about day
camp and baseball this year.

921
00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.570
He's already got a full schedule.

922
00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:18.820
- You're right.

923
00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:21.850
There's no way we can force him.

924
00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:23.110
- Thanks.

925
00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:25.710
I knew you'd understand.

926
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:26.900
- [Max] I have a feeling everything's

927
00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.980
gonna work out just fine.

928
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:08.740
- [Beth] Victor he's here
Maxy he's here in LA.

929
00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:09.800
[David] We need to stay here. mom.

930
00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.190
- [Max Voiceover] We
go he goes that is it.

931
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:12.630
- [Sandy] We're not gonna
force David to go anywhere.

932
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:14.710
He's been through enough.

933
00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:25.780
(door creaking open)

934
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.340
- Man. it stinks in here.

935
00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.670
- I'm sorry if I offend you.

936
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.070
- Don't play me for a fool again.

937
00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:08.230
- You trust him with your life don't you?

938
00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:13.320
You better.

939
00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:15.940
Nine million dollars is a lot of money.

940
00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.440
- It's 18 million.

941
00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.610
- You're counting on nine
million as your share. right?

942
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:23.180
Then you're a fool.

943
00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:24.010
- Shut up.

944
00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:27.800
(tense music)

945
00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:39.650
- You wanted to see me?

946
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:43.390
- Yes. I'll be taking a few
hours off this afternoon

947
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:44.640
personal stuff.

948
00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:49.940
- [Wendy] Okay. James.
I'll let everyone know.

949
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:22.640
- You scared me.

950
00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.720
- Hello Lena.

951
00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.330
- Why you home now?

952
00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:29.880
- Well. it's a big day tomorrow. big day.

953
00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.090
I need you to run some errands for me.

954
00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:34.150
- Right now?
- Yes. right now.

955
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:35.980
Let's see I need a couple
of bottles champagne

956
00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.440
the kind Sandy likes.

957
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:40.300
Can you pick up my black
suit from the cleaners?

958
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.470
- Anything you say. Mr. K.

959
00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.990
- Dad. what are you doing here?

960
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:06.250
- [Max] Well. I thought we needed a little

961
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:07.530
private time together.

962
00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:10.690
(car engine revving)

963
00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.340
- If you wanna talk about moving.

964
00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:18.250
then I don't wanna talk about it.

965
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:20.570
- Do you wanna hear our side?

966
00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:22.650
- I won't change my mind.

967
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:24.780
- David.

968
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:30.390
- What difference does it
make if I wanna go or not?

969
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:31.700
- I want you to tell your mother

970
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.100
that you're ready to leave LA you got it?

971
00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:35.930
Got it?

972
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:36.770
- Yes.

973
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.500
- Good.

974
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.330
Good boy.

975
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:50.230
- But. daddy. that would be a lie.

976
00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.940
- Come here kiddo.

977
00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:55.990
Come here.

978
00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.280
- But. daddy I don't wanna go to New York.

979
00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.100
- Don't walk away from me
when I am talking to you.

980
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.180
Come back here right now.

981
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:10.710
(suspenseful music)

982
01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:24.060
David. I'm sorry I yelled at you.

983
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.050
Please open the door.

984
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:37.470
We're best buds. aren't we?

985
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:38.500
I'm gonna take you and your friends

986
01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.580
to a ball game. aren't I?

987
01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.410
David.

988
01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:03.990
I won't hurt you.

989
01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.410
Open the door.

990
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:09.870
Please.

991
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:18.930
- Damn.

992
01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.840
- I love you.

993
01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.950
I would never force you to do
something you don't wanna do.

994
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.840
- Promise.

995
01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.090
You're hurting my arm. daddy.

996
01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:49.930
- That's right I'm hurting your arm.

997
01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:51.290
Come on.

998
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:53.370
We are going to New York.

999
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:55.920
You think I'll do it?
- Yes.

1000
01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.250
- Do you think I'll do it?
- Yes.

1001
01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:59.280
- Louder.
- Yes.

1002
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.180
- What?
- Yes.

1003
01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.430
- Louder.
- Yes.

1004
01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:08.750
- Now what are you gonna tell your mother?

1005
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:10.720
- About what?
- About leaving LA.

1006
01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.180
Don't play dumb with me.

1007
01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.930
- Yes. I wanna go with you daddy.

1008
01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:26.550
- I want you to go upstairs and wait

1009
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:30.220
in your room until your mother gets here.

1010
01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:34.280
Think about what you're gonna tell her.

1011
01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.110
David.

1012
01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.120
I don't think your mother
would ever wanna know

1013
01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.170
about what happened here today.

1014
01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:42.920
'Cause you know what

1015
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.810
her hand fits in the disposal too.

1016
01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:50.400
(tense music)

1017
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.300
Lena.

1018
01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.680
- What you doing with your boy?

1019
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.030
- Playing a little game fathers do that.

1020
01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:25.150
They roughhouse with their sons.

1021
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:26.580
What are you doing here?

1022
01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.160
- Forgot my wallet.

1023
01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:32.630
- We don't spy on people in America. Lena.

1024
01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:36.010
That's big brother stuff.

1025
01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.390
- But you do hurt little boys in America

1026
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:41.870
that's okay with you?

1027
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:43.280
- I'm his father.

1028
01:03:44.350 --> 01:03:45.350
He's my son.

1029
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:49.600
(tense music)

1030
01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:53.740
It's a family thing.

1031
01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:43.510
- See you tomorrow. bye.

1032
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:44.340
- Night.

1033
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.320
- Gee. you're home early.

1034
01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:17.830
Where's David?

1035
01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:20.330
- Upstairs doing his homework.

1036
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.080
- What brought that on?

1037
01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.090
- You.

1038
01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:34.430
- Boy. that's a good answer.

1039
01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:50.700
Where's Lena?

1040
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:53.680
- The moment I walked in the door

1041
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.350
she asked for the afternoon off.

1042
01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.650
20 minutes later I hear the
boyfriend in the drive way

1043
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:02.190
sitting on his horn.

1044
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:03.430
- Roman.

1045
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:05.600
- She was gone in a flash.

1046
01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.200
I don't like him.

1047
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:11.900
He's a bad influence.

1048
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.830
- Mom.

1049
01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.400
about going away.

1050
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.370
Well. I've thought it over
and I guess it might be cool.

1051
01:06:57.370 --> 01:06:58.600
- You sure?

1052
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.310
- You thought about this carefully?

1053
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:04.140
- Yeah. besides the
Dodgers they kind of suck.

1054
01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:07.200
- Any other reason. David?

1055
01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.170
- What's going on?

1056
01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:14.010
- Nothing.

1057
01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:19.220
It's just that this place
reminds me too much of

1058
01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:20.720
Lindsey sometimes.

1059
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:24.060
- Okay.

1060
01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:29.640
(dramatic music)

1061
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:38.880
- [Max] I'll be right back.

1062
01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:58.650
(telephone ringing)

1063
01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:00.760
- Hey.

1064
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.370
- Call me at the house in five minutes.

1065
01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:04.520
- Why?
- Just do it.

1066
01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.660
You're one of Coulson's
lawyers secretaries.

1067
01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:07.500
- Okay.

1068
01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.700
- He'll be okay.

1069
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:25.550
- Well. he sure did an about face.

1070
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:27.780
- I knew he'd come around.

1071
01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:29.820
It'll be good for him.

1072
01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:31.330
- Surprised me.

1073
01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:32.160
- Me too.

1074
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:36.430
(telephone ringing)

1075
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:38.120
(tense music)

1076
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.250
- Hello.

1077
01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:41.020
- Mr. Kennington please.

1078
01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.260
- Yeah. hold on just a moment please.

1079
01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:45.010
Sounds like business.

1080
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.820

thinking about selling our
house. packing our bags

1099
01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:49.600
and heading off for destinations unknown.

1100
01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:59.430
- Hey. big guy Mr. Lambert called.

01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:01.450

01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.310
- They're in dad's car.

1104
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:06.460

1105
01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:07.820

So are you gonna go

1107
01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:12.140

1108
01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.970
(dramatic music)

1109
01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:08.560
(tense music)

1110
01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:15.810
- Holy Mary mother of God.

1111

- Yes.

1112
01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.160
You have any idea how hard it is

1113
01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.630
to get an appointment with that guy?

1114
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:24.620
- As always I'm impressed.

1115
01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:25.460
- Yeah.

1116
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:30.080
You want some coffee Tone.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.310
- Okay. what's wrong?

1118
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:33.460
You cannot hide anything from me.

1119
01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.680
- I don't know.

1120
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.440
David he's just acting really withdrawn.

1121
01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.840
I can't put my finger on it.

1122
01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.370
James god he's just been
so unpredictable this week.

1123
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:47.580
I don't know what he's
gonna say or do next.

1124
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:51.020
- [Toni] Well. Sandy. he's
been under a lot of pressure.

1125
01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.980
I mean after all he is
selling his company.

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.450
- I know.

1127
01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:58.940
There is something more though. Toni.

1128
01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:01.520
(tense music)

1129
01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.850
Lena never takes this off.

1130
01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:15.040
Never.

1131
01:13:15.970 --> 01:13:19.050

01:15:57.930 --> 01:16:00.760
(chains jingling)

1172
01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.850
(locks disengaging)

1173
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:43.920

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.430

1205
01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:43.520

- Oh. James.

1210
01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.630
(dramatic music)

1211
01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.360
What the hell is going on here?

1212
01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.320
- You see what I'm doing?

1213
01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.240
I'm eating peanut butter.

1214
01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.670
and I don't ever eat peanut butter

1215
01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:19.680
unless I'm very upset

1216
01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.760
and never fucking chunky.

1217
01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:27.020
You hear that guy?

1218
01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.530
You hear that son of a bitch.

1219
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:30.500
He's gonna get out of there.

1220
01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.490
You know what Maxy he hit me. he hit me.

1221
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:34.420
He tried to kill me.

1222
01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.990
Then there's Victor
he's out there somewhere

1223
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:37.480
with his crazy fucking psychos.

1224
01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.290
I don't know what I'm
gonna do I'm going crazy.

1225
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:41.900
- Beth. calm down you're
not making any sense.

1226
01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.390
- What do you mean I'm
not making any sense.

1227
01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:45.750
You know what. you know what Maxy

1228
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:49.830
I think we're just in this
a little bit too deep.

1229
01:20:57.870 --> 01:21:00.410
- I can handle James and Victor.

1230
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:02.900
The question is what
am I gonna do with you?

1231
01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.380
- You know what your brother said?

1232
01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.580
- I know you're gonna tell me.

1233
01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:09.420
- He said when you get the money.

1234
01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:14.050
you were gonna trade me
in for a classier model.

1235
01:21:14.050 --> 01:21:16.020
- Cupid's arrows.

1236
01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:16.860
- What?

1237
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:21.300
- I'm in love. Beth.

1238
01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.830
- Maxy.

1239
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:24.250
Maxy me too baby.

1240
01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:30.140
- I can't see you anymore.

1241
01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.190
I'm a married man now.

1242
01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:38.590
- Maxy.

1243
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:41.090
(gun firing)

1244
01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:56.830
(loud banging)

1245
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.960
- Sorry kid.

1246
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:12.390
Never was very good at breaking up.

1247
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.550
(loud banging)

1248
01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.850
- Way over your head. Beth.

1249
01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:58.390
- Oh my god.

1250
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:59.220
- Sandy.

1251
01:23:00.190 --> 01:23:01.860
Please listen to me.

1252
01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:05.890
- Who are you?

1253
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:10.010
- His name is Max.
- Don't listen to him.

1254
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:12.300
- Your brother in law and my twin brother.

1255
01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.590
- The other night after
work they kidnapped me

1256
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:14.890
and they brought me here.

1257
01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:17.000
They handcuffed me to a
chair in the basement.

1258
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.560
and then he took my place.

1259
01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.060
- Sandy they were blackmailing me.

1260
01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:22.050
Beth was in on it.

1261
01:23:22.050 --> 01:23:22.930
- [James] He's lying.

1262
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:26.250
- They must have found out about Claire.

1263
01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:27.570
- Claire?

1264
01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:30.380
- They were after the money.

1265
01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:32.340
They were gonna kill all of us.

1266
01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.000
- They demanded cash after the sale

1267
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.920
immediately or they were gonna call you.

1268
01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.330
- [James] It's not true none of it.

1269
01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:40.700
- Sandy. what happened with Claire.

1270
01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:43.200
- [James] Stay away from here.

1271
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:46.830
- Come here. honey.

1272
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:49.490
(gun clicking)

1273
01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:02.430
- Sandy. come back.

1274
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:05.020
(tense music)

1275
01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.320
Sandy. stop.

1276
01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.080
He can't hurt you anymore.

1277
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.470
Listen to the sound of my voice.

1278
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:21.310
Sandy.

1279
01:24:29.410 --> 01:24:31.160
Listen. listen to me.

1280
01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:36.640
He picked us out.

1281
01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:42.890
They studied us like
bugs under a microscope.

1282
01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:46.200
- You spied on us.

1283
01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.610
- He did it.

1284
01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:48.740
You gotta believe me.

1285
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.030
- Up against the wall.

1286
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.860
- Stop.

1287
01:24:53.190 --> 01:24:56.360
- Oh. my god look at this you're sick.

1288
01:24:59.430 --> 01:25:04.030
- You are a better actor
than you are a crook.

1289
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:07.290
- How can I believe either one of you?

1290
01:25:07.290 --> 01:25:11.440
Tell me how did Lena's cross
get in the back of your car?

1291
01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.100
- What does Lena have to do with this?

1292
01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:16.290
- She used the Jeep the other day.

1293
01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:18.490
- When was that exactly?

1294
01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:21.940
- I don't know a baseball game an errand.

1295
01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.570
She picked up my suit from the cleaners.

1296
01:25:24.570 --> 01:25:25.400
- Stop.

1297
01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:30.840
- Sandy. use your instincts.

1298
01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.100
Which one of us looks like the killer?

1299
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.840
Remember what Silverstone said

1300
01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.560
you always over
anti-intellectualize things.

1301
01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.300
You've done this ever
since your father died.

1302
01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:43.140
- How'd you know that?

1303
01:25:44.190 --> 01:25:48.190
- You told me a month
after you started therapy.

1304
01:25:58.140 --> 01:25:59.130
Come on.
- No.

1305
01:25:59.130 --> 01:26:00.970
- [Max] Give me the gun.

1306
01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:02.650
- Don't do it. Sandy. he'll kill us both.

1307
01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:03.890
He'll kill David.

1308
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:05.390
- Give me the gun.

1309
01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:09.440
- Give me something. anything?

1310
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:17.140
- What Lindsey said.

1311
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:23.260
"Look. mommy it's broken."

1312
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:38.750
- You don't know what
he's talking about do you?

1313
01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:43.360
- It's something he picked up on the bug.

1314
01:26:44.250 --> 01:26:46.330
- I asked you a question.

1315
01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:55.310
- Sandy.
(gun firing)

1316
01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.180
- You're the lucky one.

1317
01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.780
You got everything.

1318
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:40.800
- Let's go home.

1319
01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.000
So big guy what's it gonna be
Yosemite or the Grand Canyon?

1320
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.030
- The Grand Canyon.

1321
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:03.780
- Grand Canyon it is.

1322
01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.190
- And Yosemite.

1323
01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:09.770
- Both dad?

1324
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:10.600
- Why not.

1325
01:28:44.290 --> 01:28:46.710
(soft music)
