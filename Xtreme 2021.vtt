00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.600
Hi. Mr. Max.

5
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.640
How's it going. Yoli? All ready?

6
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.840
Yes. all packed and ready. sir.

7
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.200
I'll put Ander on. okay?

8
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.400
-Dad!
-Tiger.

9
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.880
-Ready to travel?
-Yeah.

10
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.120
We're not putting the guitar
in the trailer. right?

11
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.840
How about up front?

12
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.240
Of course.

13
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.160
Hey. have you said goodbye
to your buddies?

14
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.760
Sort of. Only David and Lucas.

15
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.880
The others don't really like me.

16
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.800
Right.

17
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.160
Listen. son.
you can count your real friends

18
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.200
on the fingers of one hand.
and there aren't many.

19
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.600
You'll probably have fingers to spare.
So don't worry about it. All right. son?

20
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.080
Okay. but don't be long. Dad.

21
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.560
How much did he ask for?

22
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.480
Half a million.

23
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.400
-A year?
-A month.

24
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.720
Lucero is here.

25
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.440
You better stay put.

26
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.200
These Colombians already know us.
One of us will be enough.

27
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.880
Lucero!

28
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.000
-There you are. mofo!
-Don't you ever change or what?

29
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.800
-How are you. buddy?
-I'm fine.

30
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.240
Got a light. guys?

31
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.320
I was with your son yesterday.

32
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.560
We agreed you'd support us
in the conclave of families.

33
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.160
-My father can be president.
-And my son the treasurer.

34
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.280
You always liked counting bills. huh?

35
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.520
You and Tomasín. By the way.

36
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.000
here it is.

37
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.720
The conclave will be in half an hour.
Your father must be on his way.

38
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.680
Let's make a toast.

39
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.120
Cheers.

40
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.160
To health and wealth.

41
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.520
Papa San already transferred his part.

42
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.760
I'll divert it to our secure accounts
and 18% to your reserve fund.

43
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.920
Done.

44
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.960
What did Dimitri say?

45
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.400
He'll back you if the Colombians do.

46
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.560
Romeo is greedy. but he's reasonable.

47
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.600
Don't you think so?

48
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.360
Five hundred thousand…

49
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.520
a month.

50
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.920
Tomasín!

51
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.200
Tell these motherfuckers
to lower their weapons. buddy.

52
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.960
-Motherfucker!
-Freeze!

53
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.200
Don't move!

54
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.000
Kill the fucking bastard!

55
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.720
I'm here. motherfucker!

56
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.080
This way! Quick! Bend down!

57
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.400
Come on!

58
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.400
Fucking Colombians.

59
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.160
I knew it.
I told you they weren't to be trusted.

60
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.360
Rafa!

61
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.640
Call my father. Tell him Romeo backed out.

62
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.560
The meeting's a trap.

63
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.240
We need to spill some blood.
little brother.

64
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.960
We have a problem.

65
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.200
-You son of a bitch!
-Lucero!

66
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.080
The taste of death.

67
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.400
Please. don't! Please. don't kill us!

68
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.320
Get up. you dirty rat.

69
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.960
I can't stand this bastard.

70
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.520
This wasn't the plan.

71
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.480
No. But this bastard wanted
to fuck us up. and he lost.

72
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.600
Now what?

73
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.320
Father is on his way.

74
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.560
-Will you talk with him?
-Yeah.

75
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.240
Don't worry. I'll deal with it.

76
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.960
I know these things are tough for you.
but he'll understand.

77
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.760
Go home.
A new life is waiting for you. bastard.

78
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.480
You were like a brother.

79
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.680
Faithful and loyal to my family.

80
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.840
You deserve the best.

81
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.520
Love you. bro.

82
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.000
Me too.

83
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.520
I'll miss you.

84
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.240
Bet you will.

85
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.720
Sunshine. beach.

86
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.840
Your son running around.

87
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.680
You'll be thinking about me all day.

88
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.160
Take care.

89
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.840
Bro.

90
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.920
-Hello.
-Hello. Mr. Max.

91
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.040
-Did you bring the pick?
-Come here.

92
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.880
-How about a hello?
-Hello. Show it to me.

93
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.360
Here it is.

94
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.600
Tiger. you're getting stronger every day.

95
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.680
Yoli. remember to give the keys
to the owner.

96
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.600
Okay?

97
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.960
Thanks for everything.

98
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.040
You. get ready. We're finally leaving.

99
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.480
-Good luck. Mr. Max.
-Thanks.

100
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.560
Take care. Ander.

101
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.160
Father.

102
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.280
-How are you?
-Not good.

103
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.520
I don't know
if the cancer will kill me first

104
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.880
or your crazy ideas.

105
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.720
Max?

106
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.760
Where is he?

107
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.560
You were meant to come here to pay.

108
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.680
Not this.

109
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.640
The final shot is mine.

110
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.040
Father. it was a trap.
They planned to take me hostage.

111
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.560
And make Romeo the head of the conclave.

112
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.440
-Really?
-Yeah.

113
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.120
I was with him yesterday. We had a deal.

114
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.200
I never got the impression
he was unsatisfied.

115
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.720
But what do you think
the conclave will make of this?

116
00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.680
I'll disappear for a while.

117
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.840
You have no idea how this business works

118
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.680
unless it means spilling blood!

119
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.880
Blood is necessary to make it work.

120
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.520
Do you think this is America?

121
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.840
This is Barcelona.

122
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.120
Things don't work like that here.
understand?

123
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.440
Since you came back from Japan.

124
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.520
it's like you don't care
who lives and who dies.

125
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.440
Son.

126
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.800
you've changed. but not for the better.

127
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.640
You sent me there.

128
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.400
So that you'd learn
about the value of loyalty.

129
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.560
the hierarchy--

130
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.880
The Yakuza.

131
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.680
Lucero.

132
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.320
things are going to change.

133
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.440
Yes.

134
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.280
So I've heard.

135
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.800
Cancel the transfers
and the clean-up team.

136
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.560
I want everyone to see this.

137
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.880
Your weakness puts us at risk. Father.

138
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.560
Lucero. talk with your brother and sister.

139
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.880
Let them explain it to you.

140
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.400
You adopted María.

141
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.280
And Max is just your hit man.

142
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.200
A hit man who saved your life
on more than one occasion.

143
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.920
You all grew up together.

144
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.720
You're like brothers.

145
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.440
We're not fucking brothers.

146
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.360
I'm your only son!

147
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.720
Your own flesh and blood!

148
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.880
You were going to leave them in charge.

149
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.080
No. I swear I wasn't.

150
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.320
Head or heart?

151
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.720
Dad?

152
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.360
Head or heart?

153
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.160
Head.

154
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.080
I can't find María anywhere.

155
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.800
Can you hear it. Dad?
I've been practicing all afternoon.

156
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.720
Sounds good.

157
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.840
When I'm famous. and on tour.
I'll dedicate this one to you.

158
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.520
"This one is for my father!"

159
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.840
Dad.

160
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920
What is it?

161
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.440
There are people in the hallway.

162
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.000
Hide. Ander!

163
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.880
Ander. stay on the floor!

164
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.880
Know who your son always reminds me of?

165
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.760
My brother.

166
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.120
Remember him?

167
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.960
I don't know.

168
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.080
The way he talks is the same. isn't it?

169
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.040
You made Ricardo throw him out.

170
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.640
What did you say? You said he was
too fond of blood or something like that.

171
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.640
Finito. I didn't do anything
to your brother.

172
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.680
I know.

173
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.240
Yeah. I know. Máximo.
You didn't do anything.

174
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.680
Is that why he committed suicide in jail?

175
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.000
Please.

176
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600
He's my son.

177
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.080
Don't worry.

178
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.080
-Look.
-No!

179
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.600
Tell me he didn't suffer.

180
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.640
Didn't feel a thing. just like you wanted.

181
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.840
-A happy end.
-Good job.

182
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.800
-I knew I could trust you.
-Sure. you can.

183
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.400
TWO YEARS LATER

184
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.600
Daniela!

185
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.720
It wasn't my fault.

186
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.320
Damn tutorial. always the same.

187
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.720
-Right.
-Leo!

188
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.960
Come here a sec.

189
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.760
Come here!

190
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.160
Leo.

191
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.640
You have one minute.

192
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.720
-What's up? Got my gear?
-How are you?

193
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.320
How much do you want? Twenty?

194
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.240
Yeah.

195
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.920
-Enjoy.
-Take care.

196
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.360
If you had all the money in the world.
all the money you want. what would you do?

197
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.000
We always said we'd go parachuting.
remember?

198
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.320
I would buy myself a giant island.

199
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.640
Hang on.

200
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.000
GARAGE

201
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.760
Hi!

202
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.360
Anyone home?

203
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.640
Did you see him?

204
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.120
Hi.

205
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.480
Hi.

206
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.360
Hi there. Grandpa.

207
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.800
It hasn't been the same
since Los Lobos were on.

208
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.520
Here.

209
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.120
Hey.

210
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.520
There's a lot more than usual.
What are you up to?

211
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.160
I got a new job at a garage.

212
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.080
-The Gothic Quarter.
-Yeah.

213
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.880
Near the square with the graffiti.

214
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.160
-What you doing. Tomy?
-Math.

215
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.400
You'll have to teach me.

216
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.680
I suck at math.

217
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.760
Grandpa will get mad
if he sees you with his guitar.

218
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.720
And?

219
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.280
How is your birthday going?

220
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.240
Did Mom remember?

221
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.080
She gave me this T-shirt.

222
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:14.880
It's cool.

223
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.360
Giving clothes as a present isn't cool.

224
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.120
What a bummer. I bought you clothes too.

225
00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.280
Shall I return it?

226
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.200
No.

227
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.560
No?

228
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.560
-Want it?
-Yeah.

229
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.920
Come here.

230
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.480
I knew you'd get--

231
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.200
This is…

232
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Leo. this is the best one!

233
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:49.960
Awesome!

234
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.000
Don't let Mom see it. She could sell it.

235
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.360
Hi.

236
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.800
Where are you?

237
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.840
Don't kid me. I know you're not out.

238
00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.000
The signal sucks.

239
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.480
Where are you?

240
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.280
Where are you?

241
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.360
I'm at home. It's my brother's birthday.

242
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.920
Blow out the candles real fast
and head over to Charm.

243
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.320
Charm?

244
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.960
Isn't that outside our turf?

245
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.760
Not anymore. Got a problem?

246
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.200
No. none.

247
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.200
That brat is here again.

248
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.160
Thanks. bro.

249
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.360
Tell the boss it's the third time.

250
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.280
Yes.

251
00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.120
Get off me! What the fuck are you doing?

252
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.040
If I see you dealing in Charm.
I'll kill you.

253
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.160
This is your last warning. okay?

254
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.720
Help me. please!

255
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.160
Help! I'm being mugged!

256
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.440
Don't touch me again. you fat fuck!

257
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.320
-What are you doing?
-You son of a bitch!

258
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.760
Wanna die. or what?

259
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.960
Get off him.

260
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.400
What the fuck you looking at. buddy?

261
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.080
Right! Go away and mind your own business.

262
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.240
I feel like beating someone real hard.

263
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.720
And you're asking for it.

264
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.240
That was so cool. man.

265
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.200
Hey!

266
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.800
Hey. you!

267
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.920
Wait!

268
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.880
Hey.

269
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.920
All right. dude.
I just wanted to thank you.

270
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.560
That was amazing.

271
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.080
That was so kick-ass.

272
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.920
I can see you.

273
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.000
Okay. dude. Well. thanks anyway.

274
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.280
I'm outta here.

275
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.920
I mean it. buddy. You were amazing.

276
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.440
Stop making a fuss.

277
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.480
I thought my place was a mess.

278
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.480
-You live in a garage?
-I don't live here. I live in there.

279
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.200
I prefer the garage.

280
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.800
Is that a real '73 Gibson?

281
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.600
You ask a lot of questions.

282
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.320
Shit. that really stings.
What the hell is it?

283
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.960
Disinfectant.

284
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.960
Well. it hurts.

285
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.600
Disinfectant doesn't hurt. Wounds do.

286
00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.160
Whatever you say.

287
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.160
Do you play?

288
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.040
No.

289
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.640
It belonged to my son.

290
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.760
Sweet present you gave him.

291
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.200
All my old man gave me
before he left were beatings.

292
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.680
But I'm not complaining.

293
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.560
Things are looking up.

294
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.400
Everyone makes a living
whatever way they can.

295
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.320
I plan to quit as soon as I save a bit.

296
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.080
My cousin is gonna get me a job
in his company. He earns a lot of dough.

297
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.160
Right.

298
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.240
Whatever you say. kid.

299
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.160
Even though it's battered.
it's a pity you don't play it.

300
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.920
See you. Bruce Lee!

301
00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.800
Dad.

302
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.560
There are people in the hallway.

303
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.360
Hide. Ander!

304
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.720
Know who your son always reminds me of?

305
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.640
My brother. Remember him?

306
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.560
No!

307
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.480
We only have one chance to catch Lucero.

308
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.400
He's been missing for two years.
but we finally know where he'll turn up.

309
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.440
The conclave.

310
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.640
Yay!

311
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.920
Time for another go!

312
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.680
Time for another go. One. two… Yay!

313
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.600
Now he's stood up.

314
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.280
Fantastic!

315
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.360
New players.

316
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.760
Where's your boss?

317
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.480
You don't say?

318
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.360
Papa San. where?

319
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.560
Go on. ask her.

320
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.040
I'm Japanese. She's Chinese.

321
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.000
We don't speak the same language.

322
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.040
All right.

323
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.440
Okay. arigato. everyone!

324
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.160
Turn off that music. goddamn it!

325
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.880
Let's see if we understand each other.

326
00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.040
Today. in the Chinese casino.

327
00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.320
in the "cachino."

328
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.520
we have a new gambling table.

329
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.240
The nosey croupier's table. that's me.

330
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:11.960
All right?

331
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.440
I'll ask questions. and there's
a prize for whoever gets it right.

332
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.400
And those who don't

333
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.600
will be kicked out.

334
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.240
First question.

335
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.640
Where is Papa San?

336
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.920
Easy. huh?

337
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.560
Do you get me?

338
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.320
Same question. ma'am.

339
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.640
Where is Papa San?

340
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.840
Nothing?

341
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.920
It's Mr. Miyagi!

342
00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.560
Jesus. Professor Miyagi.

343
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.560
That's enough.

344
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.360
Papa San?

345
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.280
What? Didn't know it was a woman?

346
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.920
You're kidding me.

347
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.560
Come over here.

348
00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.840
Hi. old friend. How are you?

349
00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.240
-You haven't changed.
-You too.

350
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.680
You're still hiding
like the dirty rat you are.

351
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.040
and you weren't even brave enough
to come here in person.

352
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.240
I'm not hiding.

353
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.720
I'm enjoying my free time with my family.

354
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.400
Charito. here. Take her.

355
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.400
Listen. First of all. I'd like to ask you

356
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.440
to back me in the next conclave.

357
00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.400
I want to be the head.

358
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.280
Your father was a good man.

359
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.160
I was fond of him.
There was mutual respect.

360
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.080
But you.

361
00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.400
I'll never back you.

362
00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.520
Forget it.

363
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.240
All right. then consider this.

364
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.880
A hostile takeover.

365
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.080
Fucking Russians again.

366
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.960
I told you. they're real bastards.
Charm is a shithole.

367
00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.360
-You have my dough. Give me my dough.
-Always bad news.

368
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.000
Not much dough.

369
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.360
They took half of it.
That's all I could save.

370
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.000
If I tell you to go to Charm.
you go to Charm. Okay?

371
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.800
Okay.

372
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.440
Jackie Chan!

373
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.520
Your playing sucks.
If you want. I'll tune it for you.

374
00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.760
My grandpa plays awesome
when he's not drunk.

375
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.640
But he likes more flamenco. rumba.

376
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.080
I play anything but that.

377
00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.480
Then form a band. kid.

378
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.480
You're joking?

379
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.360
Share the dough with others? No way.

380
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.520
Now we're talking.

381
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.840
Tuned.

382
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.680
And free. No charge.

383
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.400
I'm Leo.

384
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.400
Max.

385
00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.440
Max.

386
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.600
I can give you guitar lessons.

387
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.840
And you can teach me a bit of…

388
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.680
Why wait?

389
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.240
Faster.

390
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.480
Very well.

391
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.000
Cover yourself.

392
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.040
-Okay. see you.
-Guard. Strike.

393
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.360
Guard. Strike.

394
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.200
You thought I'd do it wrong?

395
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:35.840
I can't go on.

396
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.440
I'm outta here. That was awesome. dude.

397
00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.080
Call me. We can do it again.

398
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.400
Bye. Chuck Norris!

399
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.800
Here it is.

400
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.760
What about you?

401
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.400
Checkmate!

402
00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.680
What are you talking about?

403
00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.520
I need you to go to Barcelona in person.

404
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.320
Speed things up with the Russians.

405
00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.280
We need to provoke them more.

406
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.040
After what happened to Papa San.
the conclave wouldn't forgive me

407
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:08.080
if I killed that scumbag Dimitri
and took over as leader.

408
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.880
They have to see
we're defending ourselves.

409
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.480
They attack us first.

410
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.080
You can't do it.

411
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.080
It's weird when you do it.

412
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.880
Not like that.

413
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.320
Like this.

414
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.400
-Hi.
-What's up. bro?

415
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.160
-You go back to Charm tonight.
-Jesus. dude.

416
00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.360
Can you send someone else?

417
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.000
Tonight is the neighborhood fair.
Lots of people.

418
00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.440
We'll make a killing tonight.

419
00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.880
I don't wanna go. Send someone else.

420
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.960
The Russians know
there'll be trouble if they touch you.

421
00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.000
We're like a family. Leo. Your family.

422
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.480
If they touch you. it affects all of us.

423
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.000
Little shit hung up on me.

424
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:09.360
If I win the lottery.
I'll get you out of this shit you're in.

425
00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.560
Fucking kid. Go after him!

426
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.440
Move!

427
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.520
Over there!

428
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.560
What the fuck is your game?

429
00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.960
First you hang up on me.
then you avoid me.

430
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.000
I didn't recognize you. Jaro.

431
00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.920
What? Do you need glasses now?

432
00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.680
What are you doing?

433
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.920
I heard you're making a bit on the side.
At my expense.

434
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.120
That's a lie.

435
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.040
I swear I haven't taken anything.

436
00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.720
-I'm clear. I swear.
-A lie? Let's see.

437
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.080
Perhaps your pants are stuffed with bills.

438
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.680
Take that away!

439
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.840
Come here. you bastard.

440
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.040
What are you doing. man?

441
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.560
-If I tell you to go to Charm…
-Motherfucker!

442
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.440
…you go to fucking Charm.

443
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.960
I knew that the code would work.
Know where Leo is?

444
00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.320
Why would I?

445
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.120
Because you're friends?
That's what he told me.

446
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.640
Didn't you save him from the Russians?

447
00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.000
I can't find him.

448
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.520
I asked around. No one knows where he is.

449
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.520
He was siphoning off money.
If Jaro found him…

450
00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.640
Well. if you see him.
tell him to give me a ring.

451
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.560
Okay?

452
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.360
You're a bit weird. aren't you?

453
00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.280
I HEARD YOU'RE IN TROUBLE

454
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.840
WHERE ARE YOU?

455
00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.520
What happened?

456
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.840
That motherfucker Jaro did it.

457
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.640
The bastard smashed up my hand.

458
00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.440
What did you expect?

459
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.320
-You were stealing from them.
-I wasn't stealing from them.

460
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.560
What do you expect
with the shit they pay me?

461
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.800
I can't pay my old lady's rent.
certainly can't support them.

462
00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.960
Yeah. I stole.

463
00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.920
I was stealing.

464
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.320
If I had a dad. this wouldn't happen.

465
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.280
But I don't. so that's that.

466
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.040
You need to see a doctor.

467
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.680
No fucking way.

468
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.480
If we go to a hospital.
they'll call my mom.

469
00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.880
I don't want problems with her.
believe me.

470
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.120
She loses it when she gets mad.

471
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.120
Don't mess it up for me.
Who are you calling?

472
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.480
Wait here.

473
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.200
-Thanks. I know this isn't the plan--
-Exactly.

474
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.320
You know the conclave is in a week.
What the hell is this?

475
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.240
-You've been distracted since that kid--
-Leo.

476
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.960
His name's Leo.

477
00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.440
Tell him to get in. I'll deal with it.

478
00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.120
Hiya.

479
00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.800
And you.

480
00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.720
Focus.

481
00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.520
Go. Watch out for the bike.

482
00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.360
Any problem. partners?

483
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.560
Let them through.

484
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.120
Dimitri doesn't want trouble.

485
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.280
They're Lucero's boys.

486
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.840
Order a few Jager bottles
and bring me some good gear.

487
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.400
I'll be out in a second.

488
00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.280
What the fuck you staring at?

489
00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.320
I'm into babes.

490
00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.720
And young guys too.

491
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.240
Calling me a faggot? Do you know who--

492
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.960
I don't give a shit who you are.

493
00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.240
Help me!

494
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.480
Get this crazy fuck off me!

495
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.640
Come on!

496
00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.480
Máximo?

497
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.040
Why the fuck do you know him?

498
00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.760
Where are you going?

499
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.400
Help me. goddamn it!

500
00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.760
Do you want money?
Is that what you want. dough?

501
00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.400
-Who do you work for?
-What?

502
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.120
Beat his ass! Goddamn it!

503
00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.800
I won't ask you again. asshole.

504
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.760
One question. one answer.

505
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.520
Okay. I get it.

506
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.840
His name's Urquiza. okay?

507
00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.360
But don't mess with him.
I'm telling you the truth.

508
00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.720
-Don't mess with him.
-You telling me what to do?

509
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.360
Stop. please.

510
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.040
You're hitting me. retards!

511
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.800
Where is he?

512
00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.040
Where is he?

513
00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.760
Are you a total jerk or what?

514
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.520
Why repeat everything I say?

515
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.840
In Seven Rain. That's where he works.

516
00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.880
I don't know where he lives.
but he works there.

517
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.080
Did you know the kid played guitar?

518
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.960
Guitar? I don't know
what you're talking about.

519
00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.440
You smashed up his hand.

520
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.400
Are you fucking getting up?
Don't be a pussy.

521
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.160
Now does it ring a bell?

522
00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.680
Fucking old man!

523
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.120
Leo!

524
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.680
You are talking about Leo!

525
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:41.880
Man!

526
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.560
Put your hands there.

527
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.880
I don't get it. Are you his dad or what?

528
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.080
He's just a fucking kid.
Who the fuck cares?

529
00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.840
Put your hands there.
or it'll be your head.

530
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.160
Don't. please!

531
00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.440
My organization will come after you.

532
00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.280
Did you hear me?

533
00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.800
No! Please don't!

534
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.120
When you come. bring coffee.
I'll serve the biscuits.

535
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.240
Where is he?

536
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.320
I fixed up his hand
and gave him something to sleep.

537
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.000
Want to train a bit?

538
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.040
Want a thrashing?

539
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.800
Find out anything new?

540
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.160
The kid works for people
who want to screw the Russians.

541
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.680
You're risking two years' work
for someone you don't even know.

542
00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.760
He's a kid. María.

543
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.000
A kid who's distracting you from our plan.

544
00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.560
We talked about it a thousand times.

545
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.640
We only have one chance to catch Lucero.

546
00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.520
The conclave.

547
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.320
There's a date.

548
00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.280
He'll be there.

549
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.120
Two years without a trace.
now we know where he'll be.

550
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.880
It's our only chance.

551
00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.480
If the families forgive him.
he'll be untouchable.

552
00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.320
Stop worrying about me and train harder.

553
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.760
Let go. You're hurting me!

554
00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.000
Cut it out. María!

555
00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.480
The guys screwing Dimitri…

556
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:43.600
Got a name?

557
00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.080
Urquiza. Ring a bell?

558
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.760
No.

559
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.680
But I'll check it out.

560
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.240
If they work for Lucero and saw you.
we'll have to move again.

561
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.200
My father's reserve fund is almost empty.

562
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.880
Jesus! My God. I see you provoked them.
and it worked. Well done. Jaro.

563
00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.720
It wasn't the Russians.

564
00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.880
Doesn't look like it.

565
00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.840
It was some crazy fuck. okay?

566
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.800
-Some crazy fuck.
-A crazy fuck?

567
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.040
Towel.

568
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.200
One of the kids I use
to provoke them has a…

569
00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.360
I don't know.
A father. an uncle. a boyfriend.

570
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.400
Don't you have a boyfriend
who protects you. Jaro?

571
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:10.640
That motherfucker was a combination
of John Wayne and Bruce Lee.

572
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.240
He beat the shit out of us
without blinking.

573
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.280
John Wayne and Bruce Lee?

574
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.040
Does he work for them? Was he Russian?

575
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.720
He wasn't Russian. damn it!

576
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.360
He was only there
because I warned some fucking kid

577
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.720
who nobody cares about!

578
00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.320
He was stealing money from us. okay?

579
00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.520
Can you believe one of my men
ran away when he saw the guy?

580
00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.960
He ran away!

581
00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:39.880
Towel.

582
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:41.920
Maybe he knew him?

583
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.760
I guess so.
Yeah. he called him by his name.

584
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.520
So he did know him. Jaro.

585
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.040
Yeah. what was it?

586
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.280
Shit. what was the name?

587
00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.200
-Like in that movie about the Romans.
-Spartacus?

588
00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.600
No. why would he be called that?

589
00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:00.160
The other one. the good one. Gladiator.

590
00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.560
What's his name?

591
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.720
Jesus. what was it?

592
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.400
-Máximo.
-That's it. Máximo.

593
00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.320
Máximo. motherfucker.

594
00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.320
Do we know where that kid lives?

595
00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.480
-Where are you going?
-Home.

596
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.400
Kid. if they are looking for you.
it's the first place they'll go.

597
00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.960
I know.
but I'm not going to wait here forever.

598
00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.400
Thanks for everything. huh?

599
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.280
And you?
Are you going to do something or what?

600
00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.280
BE ALERT
CALL ME IF YOU SEE THE KID

601
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.480
DON'T GO UP
DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL WE COME

602
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:34.920
Great.

603
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.600
Stop.

604
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.200
-Got a little brother?
-Yeah.

605
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.800
Always watching cartoons.

606
00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.880
-Wait. I'll go in first.
-Max. chill out. Take it easy.

607
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.600
Trick or treat!

608
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.840
Happy Halloween!

609
00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.000
-Thanks!
-Thanks!

610
00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.120
Hi! You're just in time.

611
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.600
Grandma. do you want
to play trick or treat with us?

612
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.160
You must be Leo. right?

613
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.640
Just talking about you with your mom.

614
00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.280
And about your new job at the garage.

615
00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.440
What have you done?

616
00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.520
You son of a bitch!

617
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.480
You!

618
00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.360
You should be dead. bastard.

619
00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.600
Like your brother or like my son?

620
00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.680
Leo! Take it easy. don't do it.

621
00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.640
-Get out of the way. Max.
-Please. Leo.

622
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:55.960
Get out of the way!

623
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.440
Put the gun down.

624
00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.760
Get out of the way!

625
00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.320
-Let him go.
-I'll let him go now.

626
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.440
Look. I'm doing it.

627
00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:07.960
I'm letting him go. man.

628
00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.280
-The kid was the perfect excuse.
-Sure.

629
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:05.520
They wanted the Russians to kill him
so the conclave couldn't object.

630
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.120
Lucero was just defending himself.

631
00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.000
And Finito?

632
00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.280
Did he see you?

633
00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:14.560
Yes.

634
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.400
I couldn't finish him off.

635
00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.120
Fuck! I don't believe it!

636
00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.280
You screwed up our plan.

637
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:25.560
When Lucero finds out you're alive.
it'll be impossible to catch him.

638
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.720
Or even worse. he won't turn up.

639
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.640
Know what you've just done?

640
00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.240
How could I be such a jerk?

641
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.800
They killed them because of me.

642
00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:37.960
Leo.

643
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.000
Leo.

644
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.400
-Take it easy.
-You guys don't get it.

645
00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.240
You've no fucking idea
what I'm feeling right now.

646
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:54.680
It hurts so bad. right here in my chest.

647
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:55.600
Leo.

648
00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.200
They killed his son two years ago.

649
00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.320
They killed my father too.

650
00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.280
I completely understand your pain.

651
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.280
It's the same one that breaks
and destroys us every single day.

652
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.640
It doesn't let you move on or forget.

653
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.160
Max.

654
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.720
When I got you out of that house.

655
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.320
all I felt was pain and anger.

656
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.480
I couldn't believe
we'd been betrayed like that.

657
00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.360
But…

658
00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:25.400
I think that now is the time
to look for alternatives.

659
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.440
We should leave here

660
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.240
and calmly think up another plan.

661
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.800
Or just quit.

662
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.200
Besides.

663
00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:46.680
the kid…

664
00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:49.880
the kid doesn't have anyone.

665
00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.880
Running away isn't my style.

666
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.400
I hacked Urquiza's phone.

667
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.320
Perfect.

668
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:09.960
Actually. it's not that great.

669
00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.680
Finito called him to request backup

670
00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.000
for a party at your garage.
They're on their way.

671
00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:17.160
Did Finito tell him who I am?

672
00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.600
-No.
-I knew it.

673
00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.400
I know that motherfucker. He wants
to sort it out before Lucero hears.

674
00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.440
-We still have time.
-I'll think of something.

675
00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.640
There's only one plan.

676
00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.400
I'm going to kill them all.

677
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.080
Hello.

678
01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.040
Hello. Dimitri.

679
01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.920
Long time since we spoke.

680
01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.800
We need to have a chat.

681
01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.840
The garage burned down.

682
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.440
We need to get him there sooner.
Tell me about Urquiza.

683
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.640
From what I could gather.

684
01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.360
Urquiza is the manager of a club.

685
01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.800
Seven Rain. It's actually a cover
for Lucero's money laundering.

686
01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.400
Urquiza is a drunk
with his fingers in the till.

687
01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.720
Rafa turns a blind eye
because he's his friend.

688
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.920
But Lucero thinks he's a jerk.

689
01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.680
And he has terrible taste in shoes.

690
01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.520
María. the club.

691
01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.160
Max. it's best if you go through the back.

692
01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.960
Sorry. sir. you can't park there.

693
01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.440
We're closed.

694
01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.520
Take it around the back.

695
01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.960
Scratch it. you pay for it.

696
01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.520
Didn't you hear the new guy?

697
01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.800
We're closed.

698
01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.200
Seven Rain. let's see.

699
01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.600
Beat it.

700
01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:16.120
A turnover of 10 million euros a month.

701
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.000
Except today. They expect 98 million euros

702
01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.360
that Lucero has to deliver
before meeting the conclave.

703
01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.800
Peace has a price.

704
01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.360
I'll swing by and have a drink.

705
01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.720
Who's that fucker?

706
01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.280
It's a big operation.
There'll be lots of guards. About 18.

707
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.720
Six at the main entrance.

708
01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.000
Six inside.

709
01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.120
And six between the storeroom
and the backdoor.

710
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.640
Fuck. he's over there!

711
01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.200
That's where suppliers go in.
plus the money to be laundered.

712
01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.920
How do they do it?

713
01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:16.080
They go in camouflage in a van
with equipment for gigs.

714
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:19.040
But instead of lights.
the boxes are full of bills.

715
01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.760
They must deliver it personally
to Urquiza in his office.

716
01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.560
Clean and simple.

717
01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.080
How long before the van arrives?

718
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.280
You have about 20 minutes.

719
01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.520
Fuck!

720
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.480
I'll send a message to Lucero
so he crawls out of his hole.

721
01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.840
But. Max. why not come here
and we'll think up another plan?

722
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.160
No!

723
01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.320
Where are you going?

724
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.360
No!

725
01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.240
-You know Lucero. right?
-Yes.

726
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.640
Good. Give him this message.

727
01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.440
You. Take out what's inside.

728
01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.160
Put it in the trailer. Hurry!

729
01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.000
All of it?

730
01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.640
All of it.

731
01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.280
I…

732
01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.280
I can't…

733
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.320
Rafa.

734
01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:20.600
He was an animal. Rafa. an animal.

735
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.520
Wanna drink?

736
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.560
Explain properly. I don't understand.

737
01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.720
Did the Russians do this or what?

738
01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.120
I'm a bookkeeper. Rafa.

739
01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.680
I'm a bookkeeper. I don't know.

740
01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:41.000
Some guy who spoke Spanish. same as me.

741
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.640
He stormed in here and killed all of them.

742
01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.480
And he gave me a message for Lucero.

743
01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.160
-A guy--
-A guy?

744
01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.520
Spoke like me.

745
01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.000
A guy by himself?

746
01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.800
A guy by himself. Rafa.

747
01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.560
-He--
-Shut up.

748
01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.840
A guy…

749
01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.760
What was the fucking message?

750
01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.640
Heart…

751
01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.880
No! Head or heart?

752
01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.800
Head or heart?

753
01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.560
And he gave me this cell phone.

754
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.960
This cell.

755
01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:23.320
He's going to call Lucero in 24 hours.

756
01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.560
And Lucero has to pick up.

757
01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:31.120
Lucero. here. in Barcelona.
and the worst part is…

758
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.680
the guy knew where the cash was.

759
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.240
Rafa. how will you tell Lucero
about the cash?

760
01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.760
Huh?

761
01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.040
Lie down.

762
01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.480
-What happened?
-It's nothing. Don't worry.

763
01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.720
Nothing?

764
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.720
It's a serious wound. I'll need
to sedate you to take the bullet out.

765
01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.200
Max. that trailer is full of money.

766
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.640
Forget the sedative.

767
01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.360
Lucero probably got the message by now.
They'll be looking for me.

768
01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.480
Okay. this'll hurt.

769
01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.720
Why do you never listen to me?
Yet here I am.

770
01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.600
Who the fuck shot you?

771
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.120
Know what?

772
01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.960
They're going to kill you.
and I won't be here to see it.

773
01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.920
What the hell is up with you guys?

774
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.640
You're like two fucking kids.

775
01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.000
I hope this will shut you up for a while.

776
01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.800
Take the next one out yourself. you jerk.

777
01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.280
How is my favorite Russian?

778
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.560
Good. And you?

779
01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:32.640
Fine. Just arrived.

780
01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.600
Are you in Barcelona?

781
01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.240
Yeah. All good here.

782
01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.720
Are you broke?

783
01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.120
No. that's just rumors. Bullshit.

784
01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.240
Trust me. we're fine.
See you in a few days.

785
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.760
Bye.

786
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.080
Did that guy say. "Head or heart"?

787
01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.240
I wasn't there.
but Urquiza said that was the question.

788
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.000
I want him to tell me to my face.

789
01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.840
He kept the cash too.

790
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.360
I just blew out the candles
on my daughter's first birthday cake

791
01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:21.720
on FaceTime.

792
01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.240
And I have to be here with you guys
instead of being with them.

793
01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.200
Jesus Christ. That makes me…

794
01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:30.960
Pissed?

795
01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.040
Screwed.

796
01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.720
Lucero.

797
01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.760
Why is he tied up?

798
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.360
Aren't there enough men here?

799
01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.920
Oh my goodness.

800
01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.320
Hold this.

801
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.520
Why is there black plastic underneath?

802
01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.200
-Get away from me.
-Thank you.

803
01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.840
98 million vanished? Doesn't matter.

804
01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.520
My reconciliation with the conclave?

805
01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.040
-I'll think of something.
-Yes.

806
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:03.000
I'm sure we will think of something.

807
01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.560
Yes. but in return…

808
01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.840
I need to know everything
about that motherfucker.

809
01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.240
The color of his hair. his skin.
his eyebrows. his eyes. type of nose.

810
01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.240
Everything.
If he pisses standing up or sitting.

811
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.800
Start talking.

812
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.720
You can see it recorded
on the CCTV cameras.

813
01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:30.040
Black and white.
A guy like me. He had a beard. His eyes…

814
01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.640
I don't remember.
He was crazy. went ape shit.

815
01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:37.080
He got into the Porsche

816
01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:42.000
and put your cash in the trailer.

817
01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.400
I didn't talk to anyone.

818
01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.720
What you're going to promise me.
here and now.

819
01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.640
is that you'll never blab again.

820
01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:50.640
No.

821
01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.320
Never.

822
01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:56.880
Done.

823
01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.240
All sorted.

824
01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:00.640
Huh?

825
01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.000
No.

826
01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.920
No!

827
01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.040
-What's that?
-To cut out your tongue.

828
01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.480
No!

829
01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:19.440
Then my buddies will take you
to the hospital.

830
01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.640
sew you up. physio--

831
01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.200
It can't be sewn.

832
01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.640
-Lucero. I can't do it.
-You can't?

833
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.720
-How long have I…
-You can't?

834
01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.840
You can't do this to me.

835
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.320
But you can screw me over?

836
01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.480
You can let some crazy guy
steal 98 million from me!

837
01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.440
Behave like a man!

838
01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.520
Show me respect and loyalty!

839
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.040
You can't do that?

840
01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.560
Give me that fucking knife!

841
01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.560
-Open your mouth! Open it!
-No!

842
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.720
Come here. Open your mouth! Open it!

843
01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:52.960
Open!

844
01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.000
He struggled too much.

845
01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.880
I stuck it in his eye.

846
01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.520
Is this the phone?

847
01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.320
Give it to me.

848
01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.520
You had it way too long.

849
01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.200
Bring me my cake.

850
01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.080
Where's Finito?

851
01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.000
He's on his way.

852
01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.400
He said he had trouble with Jaro.

853
01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.280
Lots of blood.

854
01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.360
There are a few loose ends.
but everything is under control.

855
01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.200
What the fuck is your problem?

856
01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.080
Cruelty makes us weak.

857
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.800
It makes them respect me.

858
01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.800
They fear you. They don't respect you.

859
01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.720
Fear is enough for me.

860
01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.600
Do I look weak to you?

861
01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:03.960
Is that it?

862
01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.840
There is no honor without respect.

863
01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.920
Don't give me that!

864
01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.400
I don't believe in codes

865
01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:14.720
or any of that bullshit!

866
01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.520
That was what killed Máximo.

867
01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.120
You killed him.

868
01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.760
You killed him and his son.

869
01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.360
He was weak.

870
01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.640
Weak for having a son?

871
01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.600
Where is he?
The big guy with the ponytail?

872
01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.640
Shit!

873
01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.400
Tell me. or I'll plug you.

874
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.040
You mean him?

875
01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.080
Well. well. well. What do we have here?

876
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.480
What are you looking at? Huh?

877
01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.560
Why did you come? Huh?

878
01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.240
Why did you come?

879
01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.040
Listen up. kid.

880
01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.720
I don't know what you're looking for.
but I know what I want.

881
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:23.920
Máximo.

882
01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:27.800
Where the hell is he?

883
01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.200
Come on. Please pick up.

884
01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.400
-Who's the kid?
-It's personal.

885
01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.160
-What do you mean by that?
-It's personal.

886
01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.240
Beat it.

887
01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.400
Max will kill you.

888
01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.480
Max? Wasn't he dead?

889
01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.480
-He'll kill you.
-I'll take care of him.

890
01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:16.920
Just what I needed.

891
01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.200
Let me see.

892
01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.400
Jesus.

893
01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.600
Hey. kid. Hang in there.

894
01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.000
We're nearly there.

895
01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:13.960
Come on.

896
01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.640
Come on.

897
01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:36.000
-You told me he was dead.
-Because he was.

898
01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.320
You swore to me. Finito.

899
01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.640
I even heard you bragging
you'd killed him barehanded.

900
01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.080
He was dead. Lucero.

901
01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:46.080
I don't know
how the fuck he got out alive.

902
01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.440
But he did. didn't he?

903
01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.040
Now all he wants is to take revenge.
regain his honor.

904
01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.000
Let me sort it out.

905
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:00.840
I don't know.

906
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.120
I need to speak with the conclave.
In person.

907
01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:10.040
Bring it forward. ask for protection.

908
01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.760
You'd lower yourself. Lucero.

909
01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.720
Go on. get out of here.

910
01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.440
Move it.

911
01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:24.960
Hello.

912
01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.720
Dimitri. How are you. friend?

913
01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.000
Good. and you?

914
01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.080
Fine. Listen. I have a favor to ask.

915
01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:34.400
I know this is complicated.
but you can help me.

916
01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.360
Last night they tailed them
to the hospital.

917
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.560
They're still there.
What do I say to them?

918
01:22:58.120 --> 01:22:59.040
Come on!

919
01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.920
Please leave your message after the tone.

920
01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:05.880
Listen. I'm at Hospital del Mar. room 512.

921
01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:07.600
Leo went to find Finito.

922
01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.160
and he got beaten so hard
he can hardly breathe.

923
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:20.840
My old friend.

924
01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:24.120
Ex-friend.

925
01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.080
I always thought
that you'd be the boss one day.

926
01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.480
A boss with values. with morals.

927
01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.920
You're a traitor.

928
01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.840
You abandoned Ricardo.

929
01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.760
You left Lucero as the only choice.

930
01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.080
You should have stayed.

931
01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.520
You should have been the boss.
You screwed up everything.

932
01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.720
And Lucero. who more than disowned you.

933
01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.640
ended up doing the same as you!

934
01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.440
-Where can I find him?
-Too late.

935
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.040
He moved the conclave forward
to be under their protection.

936
01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.360
How will he pay them?

937
01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.880
I have his money.

938
01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:39.280
Don't worry about that.
I'll take it back to him.

939
01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.720
He'll be untouchable after the conclave.

940
01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:43.800
Lucero beat you.

941
01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:45.240
Once again.

942
01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.000
Thanks for the information.

943
01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.400
We're the first here.

944
01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:38.960
Whatever.

945
01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:50.120
Everyone to their posts.

946
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.200
You steal my money.

947
01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.800
You kill my people.

948
01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.040
Show your face. motherfucker.

949
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:33.840
Have some honor.

950
01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:38.600
Do you hear me?

951
01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.480
You have one new voicemail.

952
01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:52.160
Max.

953
01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:58.000
Listen. I'm at Hospital del Mar. room 512.

954
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.600
Leo went to find Finito.

955
01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:05.040
and he got beaten so hard
he can hardly breathe.

956
01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.040
The time has come to quit.

957
01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.400
We've dealt with this shit for two years.

958
01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:17.920
And for what?

959
01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.160
They've destroyed Leo's family.

960
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.480
And they've destroyed us.

961
01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.480
I couldn't stand seeing you die again.

962
01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.400
So I'm taking the kid with me.

963
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.880
far away from all this endless violence

964
01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:46.120
that only kills those you love.

965
01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:52.800
I hope that…

966
01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.760
you come with us.

967
01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.160
Speak later. Think about it.

968
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.000
I'm sorry.

969
01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:27.720
I couldn't take it.

970
01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.640
I told them where you were.

971
01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:35.080
Don't worry.

972
01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:37.800
I'm still here.

973
01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:40.600
You were really brave.

974
01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.200
Brave?

975
01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.800
That guy destroyed everything I loved.

976
01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.520
And I couldn't even give him a bruise.

977
01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:56.160
What good is being brave?

978
01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:01.480
If you hadn't stood between us
at my house.

979
01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:04.920
I swear that guy would be dead now.

980
01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:10.040
I know it wouldn't bring back my family…

981
01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.600
He should be resting.

982
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.480
It's best you let him sleep.

983
01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:23.600
…but I'd feel better.

984
01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.280
Much better.

985
01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.440
Lucero.

986
01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.080
It's him.

987
01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:56.480
He's here.

988
01:31:58.520 --> 01:31:59.360
Of course he is.

989
01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.360
I'll be Yakuza!

990
01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:35.960
He's waiting for you.

991
01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.000
Back up!

992
01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:20.280
The brother who came back from the dead.

993
01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:25.840
I'm not your brother. motherfucker.

994
01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.680
Christ.

995
01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:29.160
You've finally accepted it.

996
01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.960
No. we're not brothers.

997
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:33.560
But my father…

998
01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.560
My father loved you as a son.

999
01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.200
I did have a son.

1000
01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:40.520
-And you had him murdered!
-That's also true.

1001
01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:44.720
You'd be with him
if it weren't for Finito.

1002
01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:49.320
But you insisted on abandoning him
on his journey to heaven.

1003
01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.800
I didn't abandon anyone.

1004
01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:54.080
I earned my right to choose my own way.

1005
01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:56.200
You didn't choose anything. jerk.

1006
01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:00.400
My father chose it for us.

1007
01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:02.280
How ironic.

1008
01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:05.120
Father was annoyed
I wanted to be exactly like him.

1009
01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:09.840
As time went by. he began to fear me.

1010
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.440
He loved you though.

1011
01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.720
He respected you!

1012
01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.920
I'm not here to discuss Ricardo.

1013
01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.320
I came to kill you.

1014
01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:13.240
Let's spill some blood. little brother.

1015
01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.400
Well done. little brother.

1016
01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:36.880
You don't drop the katana anymore.

1017
01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.840
Those little Buddhas taught you well.

1018
01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:06.600
One more?

1019
01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:07.960
One more.

1020
01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.520
Wait.

1021
01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:25.560
It seems you were right about honor.

1022
01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.040
I don't have any.

1023
01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:28.880
Finito!

1024
01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:30.360
Look who came to see us.

1025
01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.160
Little sister!

1026
01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:36.280
María!

1027
01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:42.760
A family reunion.

1028
01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:48.800
Come on.

1029
01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:56.520
Come here.

1030
01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.040
Let's see. now.

1031
01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.480
I don't recognize you. Máximo.

1032
01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.680
I don't recognize you.

1033
01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.160
Finito.

1034
01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:00.520
Finish your fucking job once and for all.

1035
01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:01.880
Get to it.

1036
01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:08.280
Come here. sis.

1037
01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:13.800
Second time's the charm. motherfucker.

1038
01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:17.960
Sit over here nice and still.

1039
01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.680
Rot in hell.

1040
01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.080
Bastard.

1041
01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.240
Head or heart?

1042
01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.520
Will you spare my family?

1043
01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:05.280
The same way you
and your men spared Leo's family?

1044
01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.480
Screw you!

1045
01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:16.120
Cool wheels.

1046
01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:17.720
Really cool.

1047
01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.920
It's a bit small. don't you think?

1048
01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.360
I'll get in the back.

1049
01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:35.920
But don't get used to it.
There are still hierarchies in life.

1050
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.200
Keep that in mind.

1051
01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.160
Leo. Did you say goodbye to your friend?

1052
01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:48.120
Of course.

1053
01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.240
Friends are important.

1054
01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:58.120
Aren't they?

1055
01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:20.600
UNKNOWN NUMBER

1056
01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:22.920
Hello?

1057
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.640
My dear María.

1058
01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:26.160
I was waiting for your call.

1059
01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.960
Not for you to run off. Are we good?

1060
01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:31.080
You tell me. Are we good?

1061
01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:33.040
We ruined the conclave for you.

1062
01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:34.400
The conclave is tomorrow.

1063
01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:36.320
The only thing I did

1064
01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:37.680
was set a time and place

1065
01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:39.240
for our meeting with Lucero.

1066
01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:40.600
What?

1067
01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:42.440
I never thanked you

1068
01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:45.080
for calling me to save Max.

1069
01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:47.400
It was very useful.

1070
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:53.120
What's up?

1071
01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:55.600
-I was thinking that…
-What?

1072
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.720
Not this dumb stuff again?

1073
01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:07.000
Can you save it for another time?

1074
01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:09.280
It's not too much to ask. is it?

1075
01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:12.160
It's really gross. seriously.

1076
01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:04.240
