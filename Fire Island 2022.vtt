-Yeah. well. I'm not you.
-You could be.

171

once in a while.

I was. like.
a completely different person back then.

Felt invisible all the time.
I was miserable.

183
00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:36.808
And then we came out here.
And. I don't know. something clicked.

184
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:41.062
You know. I realized how much power
I was giving away to other people

185
00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:44.607
to make me feel a certain way
and I took it all back.

186
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:50.155
Started to do some self-improvement.
and my whole life changed.

187

Babe. you don't need a boyfriend.

188
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.660
You need to learn
how to protect yourself more.

189
00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.121
'cause this romance bullshit
is making you vulnerable.

190

191
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.458
Yeah. but I want the romance bullshit.

192
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:05.420

with a boombox

194

What's wrong with that?

195
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.556
Nothing. it's just shit like that
doesn't happen in real life.

196

198
00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:31.071
Fine. If you're so invested in this.
I will try and get laid.

Yes!

200
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.866

-He has to be nice to me.
-Okay.

202

I'm not letting some guy

331
00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:36.561
You must have very strong bones.

332
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.230
Just my knees. I guess.

333
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:41.941
Oh. God.

334
00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.652
Oh. God. that does not sound right.
(CHUCKLES) Sorry.

335
00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:49.115
Um. were you guys going?
Because we were gonna catch the sunset.

336
00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:50.867
So weird. We were. too.

337
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.453
Oh. great. I'm Charlie. by the way.

338
00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:54.787
-We know.
-What?

339
00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.497
NOAH: Never mind. Just keep walking.

340
00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:01.127
Uh. do you want some whiskey?
It would help with your knees.

341
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.671
-You can trust me. I'm a doctor.
-(YELLS)

342
00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.640
CHARLIE:
...look like they're strawberries.

343
00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.350
-You know?
-That's a classic.

344
00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:17.435
What are those called?

345
00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:18.978
-Strawberries.
-They are good.

346
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:21.439
NOAH: <i>Look at those two.</i>
<i>Absolutely perfect.</i>

347
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.775
<i>Except for one small thing.</i>

348
00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.694
Hey. sorry. What do you do again?

349
00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.865
NOAH: <i>The friends.</i>
<i>That's problem number one.</i>

350
00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:33.951
I do graphic design for this start-up.

351
00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:37.622
NOAH: <i>Cooper. who told us immediately</i>
<i>that he's a brand manager.</i>

352
00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:38.748
<i>Whatever that is.</i>

353
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:42.710
And I'm a big. powerful lawyer like
Christine Baranski in <i>The Good Wife.</i>

354
00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:44.545
Seriously?

355
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.923
No. Christine is the only lawyer
I trust.

356
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.633
The rest of them are all pretty evil.

357
00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:51.802
Oh. Uh. actually. Will is a lawyer.

358
00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:54.931
NOAH: <i>Problem number two. Will.</i>

359
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:59.268
<i>He's from L. A.. super rich. and thinks</i>
<i>he's way better than all of us.</i>

360
00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.853
Uh. my bad. Sorry.

361
00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:04.273
I'm just a nurse. you know?

362
00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.901
Essential services. Saving lives.

363
00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:10.738
-Uh. what concentration? Trauma...
-Oh. no. Free clinic for gay sluts.

364
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:12.615
I mostly just weigh people

365
00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.243
and steal doxycycline
for prophylactic purposes.

366
00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:18.579
-Oh. my God. it's starting. Look alive.
-Okay.

MAX: That was better than last time.

382
00:17:57.618 --> 00:18:00.788
-I'm proud of you. girl. You set.
-Congratulations. everyone.

383
00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:01.998
(CHUCKLES)

384
00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:05.126
-We love her. Love that girl.
-I'll see you tomorrow. girl.

385
00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:07.378
Um. it's just a stupid bit
we like to do.

386
00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:09.630
(CHUCKLES) It's funny. You're funny.

387
00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:17.722
Well. it was nice meeting you.
and I'll see you around the island.

388
00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:19.015
Yeah. totally.

389
00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:24.353
What the fuck are you doing?
Wanna get fucked or not?

390
00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:25.438
I mean. not really.

391
00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:28.608
Plus. he's. like. a super-hot doctor.
And I'm...

392
00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:32.028
Do not finish that sentence.
You are a prize to be won. okay?

393
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.904
So get over there. seal the deal.

394
00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:35.364
-(BOTH GRUNT)
-Sorry.

395
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.991
Wow. Um...

396
00:18:37.241 --> 00:18:41.162
Hey. would you boys like to come
to sort of like an after-party at ours?

397
00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:42.663
It's very chill. just like

398
00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:44.915
-wine and a hot tub.
-HOWIE: Oh.

399
00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:47.585
We actually would love to.
but we gotta check with our house.

400
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:50.421
'cause I think we have other plans.
but we'd love to fit you in.

401
00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:53.841
Okay. so there's a soft plan to go
to their house for a hot tub thing.

402
00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:56.677
-LUKE: Yes. A hot tub!
-KEEGAN: What? Hot tub?

403
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.513
-BOTH: Hot tub. Hot tub. Hot...
-HOWIE: Everybody shut up!

404
00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:00.890
-KEEGAN: Shh. stop.
-HOWIE: Yes.

405
00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.558
-MAX: Absolutely.
-KEEGAN: Hell yeah.

406
00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:04.352
-NOAH: Be chill about it.
-HOWIE: Okay.

407
00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.646
Yeah. that should work for us.

408
00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:10.024
I really don't think
we needed to bring anything.

409
00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:12.026
And if you did wanna bring something.

410
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:14.070
a full bottle of wine
would've been the play.

411
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.364
Are you crazy?
I just told you we're broke.

412
00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:19.408
Wait. Do they have a house on the beach?

413
00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:22.244
Well. we can't go over there.
We are literal trash.

414
00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.914
-I'm sure their house is like ours...
-We're here.

415
00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.416
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE)

416
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.794
Yeah. we definitely
can't bring that in here.

417
00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:32.129
-(BOTTLE BREAKS)
-(MAN SCREAMS) Oh. my God.

421
00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.684
Excuse me. Can we help you?

422

NOAH: <i>That's code.</i>
<i>He does not wanna help us.</i>

423
00:19:47.478 --> 00:19:50.523
Yeah. Hi. Is Charlie here?

424
00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.192
I think you may have the wrong house.

425
00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:54.902
Why would you think that?

426
00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:57.113
COOPER: Oh. my God.

427
00:19:58.072 --> 00:20:00.241
-You all.
-You know them?

428
00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.034
Of course.

429
00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.453
They're the cute little friends
we made at tea.

430
00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:08.416
NOAH: <i>And "cute little friends" is code</i>
<i>for not a fuckable one in the bunch.</i>

431
00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:10.876
COOPER: Get up here.
Don't be rude. Braden.

432
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.462
-Get up here. he says.
-Such a bad girl.

LUKE: Hey. you guys smell good.
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Fierce?

434
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.218
(LAUGHS) Good stuff.

435
00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:20.428
We should talk later.

436
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:23.305
These stairs is nice.
Bitch. I feel like we're plus one.

437
00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:25.808
LUKE: What's the address?
I wanna order thousands of 'em.

438
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:26.892
How you doing?

439
00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:29.478
Bitch. you're on snacks. I'm on drinks.

440
00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:30.563
-Go.
-Okay.

441
00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:31.897
-A shot. please.
-I got this.

442
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:33.649
-Let me just do it.
-I was a bartender.

443
00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.693
-You were a bar-back.
-LUKE: Semantics.

444
00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:39.071
NOAH: You wanna slow down.
It's like night one. Jesus.

445
00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.741
Excuse me. Dad.
Did you not hear Erin before?

446
00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:44.452
-We have to make the most of this night.
-Fair point.

447
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.831
Oh. my God.
Bitch. Look at all of this cheese.

448
00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.916
Bring that here.
I can use that as a garnish.

449
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.043
Guess you guys aren't bottoming tonight.

450
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:56.839
LUKE: Actually. I'm one of the cleanest
ever. I've been told. bottom-wise.

451
00:20:58.215 --> 00:20:59.633
Can you cut limes right now?

452
00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:01.719
-KEEGAN: Cut limes?
-We can handle knives. right?

453
00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:03.053

455
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:08.142

is surprisingly a good gay person.

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:09.477
In like a very happy way.

-Okay.

-...really important.
-NOAH: Hey. guys. What'd I miss?

460
00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:19.779
I was just explaining this <i>SNL</i> sketch.
He's never seen <i>Gays in Space.</i>

461
00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:23.365
Honestly. the way you explained it.
I don't even wanna watch the sketch now.

462
00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.826
-You should probably watch the sketch.
-I refuse to.

463
00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.328
-Why are you being...
-Adamantly.

464
00:21:27.411 --> 00:21:30.915
Charlie. Have you seen Will?
I can't find him. He's hiding.

465
00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:33.125
Oh. Um...

466
00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:37.546
No. I haven't. But. uh... If you will
excuse me. I'll be right back.

467
00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:43.469
Cooper. have you heard of <i>Gays in Space?</i>

468
00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:45.554
-(CHUCKLING)
-COOPER: Is that like <i>Spaceballs?</i>

469
00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:51.769
Girl. please tell me you have not spent
the entire conversation

470
00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:53.729
walking him through old <i>SNL</i> sketches.

471
00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:57.358
Shut up. It's a classic.
But. no. it's been nice.

472
00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:00.778
He's a pediatrician.
isn't that so adorable?

473
00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:04.156
Sure. But is he a top or bottom.
does he eat ass. is he on PrEP?

474
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.158
Have you gained no vital information?

475
00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:10.788
It's not like that.
I think he just likes talking to me.

476
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:12.790
Then what the fuck are we doing here?

477
00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:15.501
These people are not our people.
I was talking to one of them.

478
00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:18.045
He thinks Lindsey Graham
was in <i>The Parent Trap.</i>

479
00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:19.171
Yikes.

480
00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:20.714
I gotta pee.

481
00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:29.640
Lindsey Graham in <i>The Parent Trap.</i>
I would watch that.

482
00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:39.942
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

483
00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:45.739
<i>Hmm.</i>

484
00:22:46.657 --> 00:22:48.826
<i>Let's see what Charlie's working with.</i>

485
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:51.996
CHARLIE: He hasn't asked me for drugs.
It just feels special.

486
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:54.748
And he is nothing like Rhys.
I will say that for him.

487
00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:57.710
WILL: Yeah. well. you just met him.
so it's kind of hard to know.

488
00:22:57.793 --> 00:23:00.671
CHARLIE: He hasn't asked me
what I'm into one time.

489
00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:02.298
It's so nice.

490
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:05.885
WILL: Okay. I'm just saying
you've been single for what? A month?

491
00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:09.388
CHARLIE: Calm down.
I think that he's cute and funny.

492
00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:10.931
-WILL: Great.

where you got your Speedo from.

It's so cute. Did you get it on Amazon?

reverse-engineer it a little bit.

1314
01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:20.834
But... I think I can still fix this.
I just...

1315
01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.129
(SIGHS) I don't know. It's complicated.

1317
01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:29.551

but this is me and Howie. It's serious.

ridiculous burnout.

1320
01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:39.227

and it used to look a lot like yours.

1321

-Babe. I know all your stories.

Yes. the fun ones.
Not the ones where I fucked it up.

1325
01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:54.325
I tried to fix everyone.
but what I was doing is. over time.

1326
01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:56.911
slowly pushing
everyone I cared about out of my life.

1327
01:05:56.995 --> 01:06:00.248
Until my only friends
were a group of boys half my age

1328
01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:03.001
who only put up with me
because I have a house on Fire Island.

1329
01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:04.627
That's not true. We love you.

1330

But you're missing the point.

1331

Howie doesn't need anyone to fix him.

1332
01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:13.261
Not you. not this island. not anything.

1333
01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.139

1373
01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:45.413
He has an Instagram. What a villain.

1374
01:08:46.414 --> 01:08:48.791
Okay. So he has some thotty pictures.

1375

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:54.782
AUDIENCE MEMBER 3: I know all the words.

01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:56.659

<i>Sometimes I hide</i>

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:03.124
<i>Sometimes I'm scared of you</i>

1482
01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:07.962

-AUDIENCE MEMBER 3: Give it to me!
-(ALL CHEERING)

1486
01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:25.021
Come on. girls!

1487
01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:27.523
(SCREAMS)

1488
01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:31.027
(GASPING)

1489
01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:32.903
KEEGAN: Girl. what's the matter?

1490
01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:33.988
-More words. okay?
-Luke!

1491
01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:36.615
-What's going on?
-My poor Luke!

1492
01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:39.285
Poor me? What? Oh. my God.

1493
01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.163
Is that me?

1494
01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:43.956
What the fuck?

1495
01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.002
Fuck. is that Dex?

1496
01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:51.630
-Why are you in a video with Dex?
-My friend Jonathan sent it to me.

1497
01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:54.675
Some guy named TJ screen-recorded it
and sent it to Greg.

1498
01:15:54.759 --> 01:15:57.094
who recognized Luke.
then sent it to Jonathan!

1499
01:15:57.178 --> 01:16:00.056
Probably half the cater-waiters
on the Lower East Side have seen it.

1500
01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:02.475
There's not much to do
between courses besides jerk off.

1501
01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.435
This is bad. that's my whole face.

1502
01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:07.188
Did he tell you he was gonna do that?
If it was okay?

1503
01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:08.355
What do you think?

1504
01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:10.274
I don't know. I don't remember.

1505
01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:13.235
I was so fucked up
I barely remember having sex with him.

1506
01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:14.320
This is not cool.

1507
01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.947
But I remember I woke up
in the morning and he was there.

1508
01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:19.200
And we spent
the whole day mostly fucking.

1509
01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:21.202
which I definitely consented to that.

1510
01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:24.330
And I thought the whole thing
was kind of romantic until right now.

1511
01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:26.248
-NOAH: Give me that.
-What are you gonna do?

1512
01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:28.834
Please don't do anything insane.
Just have him take it down.

1513
01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:31.754
I don't want him mad at me.
so don't be all Noah about it.

1514
01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:33.047
NOAH: <i>I'm gonna kill him.</i>

1515
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.131
Sure.

1516
01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.094
-Luke. I'm so sor...
-What the fuck! That is so fucked up!

1517
01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:40.471
You'll be happy to know you were right.

1518
01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:42.598
I'm gonna be honest.
This feels like a trap.

1519
01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:47.561
-Why am I looking at pornography?
-Look closer.

1520
01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:53.776
-I'm gonna kill him.
-No. wait. I said that. That's my thing.

1521
01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:58.697
-Hey. what's up?
-Fucking little shit!

1522
01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:04.870
-What the fuck?
-Look familiar?

1523
01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:05.955
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1524
01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:08.791
Okay. I think there's been
some kind of misunderstanding. okay?

1525
01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:10.042
You don't get to be dry.

1526
01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:13.045
If you're pissed because
I fucked your friend instead of you.

1527
01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:14.839
-the least you could've...
-Nice try.

1528
01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:18.300
I'm pissed because you're a loser and
a fraud who takes advantage of people.

1529
01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:20.302
He was willing.
More than I can say for you.

1530
01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:22.680
He didn't know
you'd put this online! That's...

1531
01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:23.764
WILL: A crime.

1532
01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:27.685
Without some sort of
written waiver of consent.

1533
01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:31.105
this meets the criteria under
New York state law for revenge porn.

1534
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:36.402
Add in the illegal substances involved
and you're looking at jail time.

1535
01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:39.613
a hefty fine.
and registration as a sex offender.

1536
01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:42.116
-Hold on. We do not have...
-Speaking with the victim.

1537
01:17:42.199 --> 01:17:44.535
I think we can resolve
this matter right now.

1538
01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:47.913
How?

1539
01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:51.709
WILL: Delete the video on your phone
and your website for starters.

1540
01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:52.877
Now.

1541
01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:56.046
WILL: I would make it
my personal mission

1542
01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:59.133
to make sure
these videos disappear forever.

1543
01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:01.093
And you have to delete your Instagram.

1544
01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:03.971
-What? No way!
-I don't think we can make him do that.

1545
01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:06.390
If a judge saw the Instagram.
they'd be on my side.

1546
01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:08.851
Fuck. just check his phone.

1547
01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:15.816
Awesome. We're done here.

1548
01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:22.448
-Those are waterproof now. you know.
-Don't ruin this for me.

1549
01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:25.201
NOAH: Shut the fuck up!
You made that up?

1550
01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:30.247
Some of it. Some of it was
a little bit of an exaggeration.

1551
01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:32.333
Holy shit! You <i>Legally Blonde'd</i> him.

1552
01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.710
-Oh. my God.
-Sorry. I don't know what that is.

1553
01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:37.046
You don't know what...

1554
01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:40.841
Oh. my God! We were having such a nice
moment. and you had to ruin it.

1555
01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:41.926
(CHUCKLES)

1556
01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:45.137
Is that what you do in L. A.?
Big trial lawyer like the...

1557
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:47.514
No. I work for a nonprofit.

1558
01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:51.810
Mostly tenants' rights stuff.
wrongful evictions.

1559
01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:53.103
Nothing sexy.

1560
01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.606
Yeah. Sure.

1561
01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.692
I'm just happy
that I could help. you know?

1562
01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:00.819
Dex. he...

1563
01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:06.367
He's never really been concerned
about enthusiastic consent.

1564
01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:09.286
Just... I couldn't do much last time.

1565
01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:11.080
My friend. he was embarrassed. I think.

1566
01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:13.457
and didn't want us to talk about it.
so we didn't.

1567
01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.334
And Dex got to keep his image.

1568
01:19:15.793 --> 01:19:18.462
Yeah. well.
people will talk about it now.

1569
01:19:18.963 --> 01:19:20.339
I've got a real big mouth.

1570
01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:23.175
I don't know how things work in L. A..
but in New York.

1571
01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:24.927
we've ostracized people for way less.

1572
01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:27.096
That's something. at least.

1573
01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:31.183
Hey. um...

1574
01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.687
Seriously. thank you. I owe you one.

1575
01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:41.819
<i>Time on Fire Island...</i>

1576
01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:49.535
<i>Sometimes it feels</i>
<i>like it stretches on forever.</i>

1577
01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:57.418
LUKE: Hey!

1578
01:19:58.168 --> 01:19:59.253
So. what happened?

1579
01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:01.338
I'll be up in a minute.

1580
01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:03.090
LUKE: Come on.

1581
01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:07.928
Sure you don't wanna come up?

1582
01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:11.432
Yeah. no.
I'm not very good at parties. So...

1583
01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:14.268
-What? You're not good at parties?
-Uh...

1584
01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:16.937
-Not Will! No.
-All right.

1585
01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:19.732
-Not good at parties? What?
-Calm down. (CHUCKLES)

1586
01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:33.162
So I pushed him in the pool.

1587
01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:35.331
and he looked up at me
and said. "I love you."

1588
01:20:35.414 --> 01:20:37.666
And I said.
"You don't know what love is."

1589
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.460
And then I realized. "You're ugly."

1590
01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:41.754
Can't believe
you're letting him tell your story.

1591
01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:45.299
Yeah. I think this is just
his way of processing things.

1592
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:47.968
Where did Will go?

1593
01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:49.553
Why would I know that?

1594
01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:52.306
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to worry about me.

1595
01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:54.183
You can fuck whoever you want.

1596
01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:57.311
Okay. that is definitely
not what I am looking for.

1597
01:20:57.394 --> 01:21:00.147
And by the way.
I'm not done worrying about you.

1598
01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:02.858
If I hadn't pushed you.
literally pushed you. then...

1599
01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:05.736
I told you.
I'm fine with the Charlie of it all.

1600
01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:08.280
-And honestly...
-Are you talking about me?

1601
01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.824
No. We're talking
about our other friend Charlie.

1602
01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:13.452
He died in a fire.

1603
01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:14.912
It's really sad.

1604
01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:17.039
Oh. my God. I'm so sorry.

1605
01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:19.541
-Ignore him. Did you have fun?
-(CHUCKLES)

1606
01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:22.586
I did. Yes.
We don't usually go to karaoke.

1607
01:21:22.753 --> 01:21:27.633
Just the parties. So. I was glad
that you showed it to me before Rhys...

1608
01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:31.095
Choo-choo. where's my vodka soda?
Baby's thirsty.

1609
01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:32.763
Uh...

1610
01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:36.975
Sorry. you guys don't know each other.
Rhys. this is Howie and Noah.

1611
01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:40.270
Oh. my God. cute. Boyfriend twins!
It's like looking in a mirror.

1612
01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:42.189
CHARLIE: Sweetie.
they're not boyfriends.

1613
01:21:42.272 --> 01:21:43.941
Come on. let's go in and dance.

1614
01:21:44.024 --> 01:21:45.984
(WHISPERING) I'm horny. okay?

1615
01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.195
CHARLIE: I'll see you guys later?

1616
01:21:48.695 --> 01:21:50.280
-COOPER: Later. hons.
-CHARLIE: Bye.

1617
01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:53.867
Yeah. I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and scrub my eyeballs out.

1618
01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:55.702
Yeah. probably a good plan. Hey.

1619
01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:59.373
(BOTH MOUTHING)

1620
01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:03.669
You know what?
Actually. let's do it later.

1621
01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:04.878
No. We're doing it now.

1622
01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:08.590
-Hey.
-Hey.

1623
01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:11.093
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Hey. Um...

1624
01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:12.428
How are you doing?

1625
01:22:13.137 --> 01:22:15.681
Look. you did not have to do that
for me before.

1626
01:22:16.557 --> 01:22:17.641
Especially for me.

1627
01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:19.560
'cause I'm such a bitch
to you all the time.

1628
01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:22.104
I know we're friends.
but things are obviously different...

1629
01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:25.357
It's not even that we're friends. Luke.
We're more than that.

1630
01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:29.736
We're family. right?
Like. that means something to me.

1631
01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.321
Because you two and...

1632
01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:34.741
All you guys. you're. like. all I have.

1633
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:42.124
Whatever. Are we gonna hug
and wrap this up? How does this end?

1634
01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:44.084
Why don't we get fucked up and dance?

1635
01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:46.712
Come on. You're gonna be okay.

1636
01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.213
LUKE: Oh. I am?

1637
01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:49.756
-Are we gonna hug?
-NOAH: No.

1638
01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:53.635
(GRUNTS)

1639
01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:01.852

Oh. my God. You cannot end
your vacation because of one guy.

It's not just about Charlie.
It's a lifetime of Charlies.

how shitty it can be sometimes

1653
01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:55.822
to feel unwanted like this.

1654
01:23:57.407 --> 01:23:59.993

that you've found a way to feel good

1655

despite all the fucked-up shit
we deal with.

1656
01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:07.960
But you think that if you're vulnerable
for just one second.

1657
01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:10.254
that it's all gonna come crashing down.

1658
01:24:10.337 --> 01:24:15.425
And maybe that's true for you.
but it's not true for me.

1659
01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:18.595

that they're working for you either.

1665
