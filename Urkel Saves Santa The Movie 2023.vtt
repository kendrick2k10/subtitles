00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:28.028
{\an8}The holiday season is here.

4
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.537
{\an8}And I've been knitting
the perfect sweater
for Ugly Sweater Day.

5
00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:39.832
{\an8}Just so you know.
I don't think you're ugly.

6
00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:41.917
{\an8}I could spend forever
in your arms...

7
00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:45.546
{\an8}Your itchy. scritchy-scratchy
wool arms.

8
00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:48.424
{\an8}So nice.

9
00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:52.261
{\an8}Thanks. Urkelbot.

10
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:54.722
{\an8}Now that it's officially
the holiday season.

11
00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:58.559
{\an8}this room feels
so November. Ugh.

12
00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.352
{\an8}But this is the perfect time

13
00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:02.313
{\an8}for me to try out
my newest invention.

14
00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:08.068
{\an8}Steve Urkel Industries presents
the Decemberizer!

15
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.862
{\an8}With a simple flip of a switch.

16
00:01:09.862 --> 00:01:12.072
{\an8}the holidays are
at your fingertips.

17
00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:19.288
Oops!

18
00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:39.099

Happy Early Hanukkah.
Mr. Kalan.

91
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.603
That's not a thing.

92
00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:15.399
It's just Hanukkah.
And it hasn't started yet.

93
00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:18.569
But that doesn't mean
you can't get a head start
on celebrating.

94
00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.114
Anybody need help getting
holiday lights out of
a musty basement?

Kochiyama family?
I'm looking at you.

96
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:29.038
Steve. dear.
What we need is sleep.

97
00:05:29.038 --> 00:05:31.081
But. I let you sleep in
this year!

98
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:35.502
Sure. compared to last year.
when you woke us up
at midnight!

99
00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.630
I just want this holiday season
to be the best it can be!

100
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.966
And that means we can't waste
a minute of it!

101
00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:43.135
- As one of Santa's helpers.
- Steve?

102
00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:45.637
One of Santa's
"unofficial" helpers.

103
00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:47.931
I want everything to be perfect
for the big guy

104
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.683
when he arrives. It's my job...

105
00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.226
Not your job.

106
00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.728
...to make sure there's enough
good cheer spread

107
00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:54.813
into every nook and cranny
of this month.

108
00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.982
It's not
an English muffin. kid.

109
00:05:56.982 --> 00:06:00.736
It's a month where we buy
more candles and wrapping paper
than usual.

110
00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:03.906
Oh. I beg to differ.
It's Mr. K! Smell the air!

111
00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:05.616
It's different
during the holidays.

112
00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:08.494
Smells the same to me.

113
00:06:08.494 --> 00:06:11.747
Like snow
and pumpkin spiced garbage.

114
00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:15.709
You can't get that in July.
which is why Santa doesn't
show up in the summer.

115
00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.045
He shows up in December

116
00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:21.256
because Santa's drawn
to the lumens of string lights.
the pollen of mistletoe.

117
00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:25.135
the euphoria of giving gifts
and higher concentrations
of goodwill.

118
00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.387
I always assumed
it was the Christmas carols?

119
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.598
Those too.

120
00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:32.726
Now who wants to head
to the mall for a little
mall-iday window shopping?

121
00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.562
Steve. how can I put this
delicately?

122
00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.523
- No!
- What he said.

123
00:06:39.108 --> 00:06:41.944
Well. that was not the answer
I expected.

124
00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:44.071
Here's a thought!
You all rest up.

125
00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:46.240
Dream some holiday
themed dreams.

126
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.742
And when I get back.
I'll be going door to door

127
00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.537
to test and untangle
everyone's holiday lights!

128
00:06:51.537 --> 00:06:53.789
These holidays aren't gonna
celebrate themselves!

129
00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.464
This package needs a signature.

130
00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.466
I know you're in there.
Mrs. Paxson.

131
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.345
Go. get him!
Guard up on him!

132
00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:11.515
He can shoot!
Oh! Time out. time out.

133
00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:13.183
Steve! Wait up!

134
00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:15.310
Hey. thanks for fixing up
the court man. It's amazing!

135
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.981
Aw. no sweat Jordan!
Well except for the sweat
on the court.

136
00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:21.984
I'm glad that
my microwave powered.

137
00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:24.153
climate controlled concrete
is a hit!

138
00:07:24.153 --> 00:07:26.155
Microwave powered? Wait. wait!

139
00:07:26.155 --> 00:07:28.532
Is it going to stunt our growth
or anything?

140
00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:32.744
Not at all. My Urkel Industries
patent-pending Clima-Crete
is perfectly safe.

141
00:07:36.415 --> 00:07:38.333
If anything. it might make you
grow a few inches.

142
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.335
- Really?
-  No.

143
00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:42.754
You're probably never gonna get
taller than five foot ten.

144
00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:46.925
just basing that on your
general bone density
and family history. Sorry.

145
00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:50.929
Now Horace
on the other hand. whew.
you might hit seven feet!

146
00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:53.515
Hey. uh. you should
take your jacket off
and stay a while.

147
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.309
As much as I'd love
to impress you

148
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:58.353
with this killer cross over.
I've gotta head to the mall!

149
00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.855
It's a big day!

150
00:07:59.855 --> 00:08:02.024
They're lighting up
the giant Christmas tree.

151
00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:05.360
- What? They like plug it in?
- Yes!

152
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.655
Over two thousand
twinkling lights
and shiny ornaments!

153
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.074
I like to oversee
the stringing of the garland.

154
00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.952
Make sure the popcorn
to cranberry ratio isn't off.

155
00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.579
Do you get paid to do that?

156
00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:18.624
No. It's sort of a
volunteer position I created.

157
00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:21.585
It's tough and tasty work
but someone has to do it.

158
00:08:21.585 --> 00:08:25.756
The city's gotta be perfect
for when the big guy arrives
on his sleigh!

159
00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:28.050
Oops! I almost walked off
with the rock.

160
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.927
Hey Horace! No look pass!

161
00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:50.447
Whoa? What! What the?

162
00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.699
Steve! What'd you do?

163
00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.701
You're always saying
how you want to make it rain
buckets on the court.

164
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.328
so there you go!

165
00:08:56.328 --> 00:08:58.872
I built a rain machine.

166
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:02.376
Although I don't know
why you'd want to play b-ball

are not really brothers?

Nope. Not today.

How about red bottoms?

275

332
00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:02.165
Ho-ho-ho.

333
00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:07.003
Ho...
Ho...
Ho.

334
00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:10.882
Ho-ho-ho.

335
00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:13.051
Okay. I got it.

336
00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.845
Ho-ho-ho!

337
00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.347
Eh...

338
00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.641
Oh. gimme a break!
I'm a little rusty!

339
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.434
Got to come in here
for these ho-ho-ho's.
I don't get to practice them.

340
00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:24.854
Now. what would you like
for Christmas. uh...

341
00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.732
Steve Urkel. sir.

342
00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:30.610
What would you like
for Christmas. Steve Urkel sir?

343
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.862
I only want one thing
this year.

344
00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:37.242
One thing?
That's very considerate of you
to keep Santa's bag light.

345
00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:38.910
So what is it?
A new video game system?

346
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.538
A puppy dog?
Please don't say world peace.

347
00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:43.832
- Cheese!
- Are we taking a picture now?

348
00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:47.627
No. I want cheese
for Christmas!

349
00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:50.755
Hmm. cheese?

350
00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:54.425
You thinking like
a grocery store cheese plate
with some charcuterie?

351
00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.469
Maybe a cheese of the month
club type of thing?

352
00:18:56.469 --> 00:19:00.557
Not quite. This year.
I'd like a taste of
one of the rarest.

353
00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:03.309
most exquisite cheeses
in the world.

354
00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:05.520
Ooh. You're a boy
after my own heart.

355
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.938
I like a fine cheese.

356
00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:09.107
- Stop it! Stop it!

357
00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:14.070
What are we talking about?
A stilton? A Manchego?
A nice camembert?

358
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.156
Serbian donkey cheese!

359
00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:19.784
- Serbia who now?
- Serbian donkey cheese.

360
00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:21.744
Do that sell that
at one of those fancy
grocery stores?

361
00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:24.414
No.
You have to travel to Serbia...

362
00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:27.834
<i>Where you must take
a ferry to a small.
remote village.</i>

363
00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:31.713
<i>there atop a mountain
that can only be reached
on foot.</i>

364
00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:37.218
lives one cheese monger
who has perfected the art
of milking donkeys.

365
00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.596
Eww. Gross.

366
00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:43.349
Which isn't easy.
because donkeys don't produce
much milk and they kick. A lot.

367
00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:45.143
Let me get this straight.

368
00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:48.313
You want cheese
from a tiny horse?
For Christmas?

369
00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:49.898
- Yep.
- Whoa!

370
00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:52.942
Serbian donkey cheese
is expensive!

371
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.819
That's more than
I pay in rent!

372
00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:55.945
You sure you don't want
a puppy?

373
00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.614
I can't. Allergies.

374
00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:59.949
Aw! You're allergic to dogs?

375
00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.035
No. Dogs are allergic to me.

376
00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:04.162
The sound of my voice.
to be exact.

377
00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:07.540
The decibel range is a little
too harsh for their sensitive cochlea.

378
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.419
Okay. Well. Santa will see
what he can do
about your cheese.

379
00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:12.670
Oh! Robin!!

380
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.006
Okay. Who's ready for a photo?

381
00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:16.841
Donkey cheese!

382
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.430
People are really missing out
on capturing a special moment
like this!

383
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.390
Why is your phone so old?

384
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.893
It looks like it could be
my phone's grandmother!

385
00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:30.438
Electronic waste is such a huge
environmental problem.

386
00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:33.608
so rather than buy a new phone.
I figured it might be nice

387
00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:36.152
to see if I could breathe
new life into something old.

388
00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:40.323
Oh. sure.
Kind of like rebooting
an old movie or TV show?

389
00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:41.991
Um...

390
00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.248
Hey. I should post this photo.

391
00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.876
Once people see me having
all this holiday fun.

392
00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:53.962
they'll want to get their photo
with DSS

393
00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:56.214
and that'll kickstart
a yuletide celebration

394
00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:57.757
that will pique
Santa's interest!

395
00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:03.471
Okay.

396
00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:12.438
And just like that
we're viral. baby!

397
00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:14.107
I'm an influenza!

398
00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:16.734
You mean influencer?

399
00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:18.820
Not when you're this viral!

400
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.030
I'm taking away my like.

401
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:25.743
Oh! Whoa. mama!
Guess who is going live
right now?

402
00:21:25.743 --> 00:21:27.829
Dudley Von Durffel!

403
00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:30.039
- The billionaire?
- The tech genius!

404
00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.666
Who is a billionaire.

405
00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:34.085
People call him
the "real life Bruce Wayne."

406
00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:37.338
In that he has unresolved
trauma at the tragic loss
of his parents?

407
00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:40.133
No! Because he's crazy rich!

408
00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:43.261
The guy owns a yacht
that is also a hot air balloon!

409
00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:47.056
No. having a yacht air balloon
isn't what makes him cool.

410
00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:51.978
Dudley Von Durffel is cool
because he sees innovation
where others don't.

411
00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:57.567
Hello! Wave emoji! Wave emoji!

412
00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:59.444
It's me. Dudley Von Durffel.

413
00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:02.947
Just maxxin' and chillaxin'
poolside 20.000 feet in the air

414
00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:06.367
and I figured why not check in
with my Von Durffollowers.

415
00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:08.745
Is he bored and desperately
looking for connection

416
00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:11.456
to feed the insatiable appetite
of his growing ego?

417
00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.750
Ugh. thumbs down emoji!

418
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.127
I just want to get
to know my peeps. VDI!

419
00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:25.511
Huh? Again?

420
00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:28.639
Let's find someone cool
to interface with.

421
00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:32.226
Ugh! Here's a person:
@steveurkel.

422
00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:33.686
That's me.

423
00:22:33.686 --> 00:22:36.022
How is your phone's camera
better than mine?

424
00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:39.025
<i>Hello. Dudley!
I'm such a huge fan!</i>

425
00:22:39.025 --> 00:22:41.152
<i>I'm an inventor myself.</i>

426
00:22:41.152 --> 00:22:43.446
It appears he is a five time
winner of his state's science fair.

427
00:22:43.446 --> 00:22:46.866
<i>Uh. okay. well. I was
a nine time state
science fair champ.</i>

428
00:22:47.742 --> 00:22:49.535
- Boom!
- Wowzer!

429
00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:52.538
<i>Right? I want to give you
some advice. @steveurkel.</i>

430
00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:56.751
- Oh. just Steve is fine.
<i>-@steveurkel... you need
to stop inventing.</i>

431
00:22:56.751 --> 00:22:57.835
What?

432
00:22:57.835 --> 00:23:00.505
<i>And start disrupting!</i>

433
00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:02.173
I've got to be honest. Steve.

434
00:23:02.173 --> 00:23:04.300
Disrupting things seems like
it could upset people.

435
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.260
<i>Maybe @steveurkel's friend--</i>

436
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.180
<i>Facial recognition says
her name is Robin Robles.</i>

437
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.057
<i>You know that I'm not using
names anymore!</i>

438
00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:13.518
<i>The future of communication
is handles! Okay!</i>

439
00:23:13.518 --> 00:23:17.230
<i>On the socials I'm @robirob381.</i>

440
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.607
<i>Thank you! @robirob381.</i>

441
00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:22.193
<i>There was a time when people
traveled everywhere</i>

442
00:23:22.193 --> 00:23:24.737
<i>by horse drawn carriage. okay.</i>

443
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:29.158
<i>But then Henry Ford
disrupted all of that
with the automobile.</i>

444
00:23:29.158 --> 00:23:31.410
<i>Does that make Henry Ford
a bad guy?</i>

445
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:35.456
<i>Not for the car stuff.
but definitely for some
of the other stuff.</i>

446
00:23:35.456 --> 00:23:37.875
Fair point... He was...
He was not a good person.

447
00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:40.419
No. He was a real l-o-s-3-r.

448
00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:42.713
<i>Auto correcting.
He means "loser."</i>

449
00:23:42.713 --> 00:23:45.216
<i>Inventing is giving people
what they want!</i>

450
00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:48.594
<i>Now disrupting is grabbing
people by the collar
and yanking them</i>

451
00:23:48.594 --> 00:23:50.304
<i>into the future! Yeah.</i>

452
00:23:50.304 --> 00:23:52.223
Huh? what do you think
he means by... Help!

509

Wow! Okay. now I want
to find something to disrupt!

510
00:26:14.156 --> 00:26:16.617
Look. I'm not sitting
in my own yacht air balloon

511
00:26:16.617 --> 00:26:18.911
because I waited for permission
to change the world.

512
00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:20.705
No. I just changed it

513
00:26:20.705 --> 00:26:23.249
and this baby is
a very expensive.

514
00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:26.627
really. like really.
fuel inefficient thank you gift
for myself. Yeah.

515
00:26:26.627 --> 00:26:30.381
Whoa! Whoa!
Keep it steady. VDI!

516
00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:32.341
We've got some choppy
skies up here.

517
00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:34.677
You see. this is why we need
to get rid of the wind!

518
00:26:34.677 --> 00:26:38.097
Ugh. @steveurkel.
look around you.

519
00:26:38.097 --> 00:26:41.851
Is there something
that you see that
could be better for society?

520
00:26:41.851 --> 00:26:47.732
Hmm. Since it's the holidays.
maybe there's a way to spread
even more holiday cheer?

521
00:26:47.732 --> 00:26:49.734
<i>Well. if you think the holidays
need shaking up.</i>

522
00:26:49.734 --> 00:26:51.986
<i>then find a way
to disrupt them. buddy.</i>

523
00:26:51.986 --> 00:26:53.487
<i>The nicest thing you can do
for people</i>

524
00:26:53.487 --> 00:26:55.698
<i>is disrupt their lives
for the better.</i>

525
00:26:55.698 --> 00:26:57.825
<i>- Okay?</i>
- All right.

526
00:26:57.825 --> 00:27:00.953
- I'm going to disrupt
the holidays.

527
00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:02.455
Um...

528
00:27:02.455 --> 00:27:03.622
Steve.

529
00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:07.835
Look at that.
You've already started.

530
00:27:18.179 --> 00:27:19.722
Thanks. Urkelbot.

531
00:27:19.722 --> 00:27:21.390
If this is going to become
the best holiday ever.

532
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.809
I need to become
Santa's Number One Elf.

533
00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:25.227
Ooh! Even better!

534
00:27:25.227 --> 00:27:29.106
Santa's Urkelf! But what to do?

535
00:27:29.106 --> 00:27:31.901
Hmm. We might be pulling
an all-nighter.

536
00:27:41.327 --> 00:27:42.870
Ah! I think I've got it!

537
00:27:46.624 --> 00:27:49.585
Oh. that's good.
That's really good.

538
00:27:49.585 --> 00:27:51.754
Ow. that's hot!
That's really hot!

539
00:27:57.635 --> 00:28:00.930
One hot cocoa.
milk and two sugars.

540
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.890
Thanks.

541
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.476
You catch the game last night?
Nobody was rebounding!

542
00:28:05.476 --> 00:28:09.063
And then they had the nerve
to just play zone defense
for a bunch of possessions.

543
00:28:09.063 --> 00:28:11.190
Good morning. festive friends!

544
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.401
Steve?
What are you doing here?

545
00:28:13.401 --> 00:28:15.986
Wait. are you one of those kids
that wants to pull on
Santa's beard?

546
00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:18.239
Collect the hair to make
a pillow that hears
your wishes?

547
00:28:18.239 --> 00:28:20.324
I've heard about creepy
Santa super fans like you.

548
00:28:20.324 --> 00:28:22.076
I'm not a super fan!

549
00:28:22.076 --> 00:28:23.744
I'm here
in an official capacity.

550
00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:26.580
{\an8} You're not
one of Santa's helpers.

551
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.000
Well. technically speaking.
I'm one of Santa's disrupters!

552
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.211
It's a different department
than helper!

553
00:28:32.211 --> 00:28:36.340
I'm here to make sure
the holidays are operating
at peak performance.

554
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.678
and that means making sure
everyone has a great holiday.
even you. big guy.

555
00:28:40.678 --> 00:28:44.515
I was thinking since people
aren't coming to the mall
as much.

556
00:28:44.515 --> 00:28:47.643
how could we get more people
to see DSS?

557
00:28:47.643 --> 00:28:48.811
Start a podcast?

558
00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:51.480
Last night. inspiration struck.

559
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.607
Kids still need to see Santa.

560
00:28:53.607 --> 00:28:56.485
so I built something to help
spread a little of that
mall-iday cheer.

561
00:28:56.485 --> 00:28:59.989
I made you an app
that lets kids call you
whenever they want.

562
00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:02.783
You built an app overnight?

563
00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:04.201
And you're still this chipper?

564
00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:06.537
Hmm. That's a pretty
great idea. Steve.

565
00:29:06.537 --> 00:29:08.414
So the kids and I
can connect virtually?

566
00:29:08.414 --> 00:29:11.000
Even better.
Let me see your phone.

567
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.334
Don't go through my photos.

568
00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:14.545
Just... bringing it online.

569
00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:32.271
- What the--
- That's right.

570
00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:34.565
Why just talk to Santa
on your phone

571
00:29:34.565 --> 00:29:38.152
when you can have him
delivered to your door
with the press of a button.

572
00:29:38.152 --> 00:29:43.574
You failed to mention the part
where you also built engine
powered reindeer.

573
00:29:43.574 --> 00:29:47.077
Oh. no no no no no!
I do not like this idea!

574
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.261
What the Monterey Jack!

575
00:30:10.768 --> 00:30:13.395
Steve! Stop this thing!
Take us back to the mall!

576
00:30:13.395 --> 00:30:16.941
But you don't want
to disappoint the kid
who just requested you!

577
00:30:16.941 --> 00:30:20.110
Fine! Fine! But at least
slow this thing down!

578
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.195
On it.

579
00:30:23.364 --> 00:30:24.406
Whoopsie!

580
00:30:25.783 --> 00:30:26.951
Whoa. whoa.

581
00:30:30.746 --> 00:30:33.415
Oh. my gosh! Oh! Oh. my heart!

582
00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:35.417
Santa?

583
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.798
Ho-ho-ho! Hey there. Uh...

584
00:30:40.798 --> 00:30:41.924
Scottie.

585
00:30:41.924 --> 00:30:43.926
Hold up. Steve. Are you an elf?

586
00:30:43.926 --> 00:30:46.637
Did you go through the
six week training program?

587
00:30:46.637 --> 00:30:48.722
Oh. My mistake.

588
00:30:48.722 --> 00:30:49.974
Scottie Harper.

589
00:30:49.974 --> 00:30:51.850
Hello. Scottie.
Why don't you

590
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.644
hop on Santa's lap
and we can discuss--

591
00:30:53.644 --> 00:30:55.813
-  Uh-oh.
- What is "Uh-oh." Steve?

592
00:31:03.988 --> 00:31:05.531
How're you do--

593
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:08.117
When I was burning
the midnight oil...

594
00:31:08.117 --> 00:31:10.953
I may have
forgotten to...

595
00:31:10.953 --> 00:31:13.539
create a subroutine...

596
00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:16.292
to manage the requests...

597
00:31:16.292 --> 00:31:19.461
So. every kid who's
requesting Santa right now

598
00:31:19.461 --> 00:31:22.298
is going
to get Santa right now?

599
00:31:29.763 --> 00:31:30.931
Steve!

600
00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:33.017
Ho-ho-ho...

601
00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:39.440
Oh. relax. big guy.

602
00:31:40.983 --> 00:31:42.735
It's just a little hiccup.

603
00:31:45.154 --> 00:31:48.866
A hiccup? Steve.
shut it down! Shut it down!

604
00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:50.868
Take us back
to the mall right now!

605
00:31:50.868 --> 00:31:52.703
- Right now!

606
00:31:55.998 --> 00:32:00.336
Steve. you might wanna
hold on to something!

607
00:32:00.336 --> 00:32:01.712
Huh?

608
00:32:10.471 --> 00:32:13.891
Nope. No critters
on my bus.

609
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.361
Whoa. Nelly!

610
00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:26.654
Wait a minute.

611
00:32:26.654 --> 00:32:28.322
Where's
Department Store Santa?

612
00:32:28.322 --> 00:32:30.366
Steve!

613
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.499
Did I do that?

614
00:32:41.251 --> 00:32:43.879
What is wrong with you?

615
00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:47.091
I just wanted everyone
to have an amazing holiday.

616
00:32:47.091 --> 00:32:50.886
And you figured you'd do that
by blowing up my sleigh
and destroying my pants?

617
00:32:50.886 --> 00:32:53.347
I have no pants.
I have no pants!

618
00:32:53.347 --> 00:32:56.225
- But you do have
very classy underpants.

619
00:32:56.225 --> 00:32:58.769
These are bugs
that can be easily fixed.

620
00:32:58.769 --> 00:33:00.854
As Dudley Von Durffel
likes to say--

621
00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:03.232
Dudley Von Durffel
didn't do this. Steve.

622
00:33:03.232 --> 00:33:05.025
You did.

623
00:33:05.025 --> 00:33:07.403
There's a city full of kids
who didn't get to see Santa.

624
00:33:07.403 --> 00:33:10.030
but did see
a bunch of reindeer explode!

625
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.200
And to top it off.
you destroyed Pretzelegance.

626
00:33:14.535 --> 00:33:17.246
Please. DSS.
this was a beta test.

627
00:33:19.415 --> 00:33:22.584
I can iron out these
wrinkles. get you back up
and running in no time.

628
00:33:22.584 --> 00:33:24.420
We're all Team Santa here.

629
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.130
No. Steve.

630
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.549
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.

631
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:32.302
You're not
one of Santa's helpers. I am.

632
00:33:32.302 --> 00:33:35.305
I mean. I was until
you destroyed Santa's Village.

633
00:33:35.305 --> 00:33:37.725
"Destroyed" seems
like a bit of an exaggeration.

634
00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:41.228
Well. uh...

635
00:33:41.228 --> 00:33:42.771
"Destroyed" makes sense.

636
00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:45.190
Do you wanna know
why I was working here?

637
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:49.319
I wanted to surprise my dad
this year and get him
some ESL classes.

638
00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:52.614
He's from Ecuador
and he always worries
his English isn't good enough.

639
00:33:52.614 --> 00:33:55.075
So. I thought
it would be a great gift.

640
00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:56.869
That is really thoughtful.

641
00:33:56.869 --> 00:33:59.079
But thanks to you. now I can't.

642
00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:01.623
Robin. I didn't mean
to destroy anything.

643
00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:04.710
I just wanted
to help make the holidays
the best they can be.

644
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.712
You-- You wanna help?
Don't help.

645
00:34:06.712 --> 00:34:09.506
Stay away. very far away.

646
00:34:09.506 --> 00:34:11.508
You've ruined everything.

647
00:34:11.508 --> 00:34:13.635
If I were you.
I wouldn't even count
on any horsey cheese.

648
00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:15.429
Uh. donkey cheese.

649
00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:20.934
Huh? Mm? Mm.

650
00:34:32.321 --> 00:34:34.823
{\an8}<i>From mall-iday to malady.</i>

651
00:34:34.823 --> 00:34:37.826
{\an8}<i>Christmas is under attack!</i>

652
00:34:42.664 --> 00:34:47.878
<i>Did I do that?</i>

653
00:34:47.878 --> 00:34:50.672
<i>Did I do that?</i>

654
00:34:50.672 --> 00:34:54.301
{\an8}<i>Oh. ho. ho.
he did do that. America.</i>

655
00:34:54.301 --> 00:34:58.514
{\an8}<i>That bespectacled bully
made a fool of Santa Claus.</i>

656
00:34:58.514 --> 00:35:01.683
{\an8}<i>And since
now I'm showing it to you
on national television.</i>

657
00:35:01.683 --> 00:35:06.730
{\an8}<i>he made a fool of Santa Claus
on national television.</i>

658
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.691
Steve. how can you
watch that lady?

659
00:35:09.691 --> 00:35:14.279
Every week.
she's finding a new thing
that is "destroying America."

660
00:35:14.279 --> 00:35:19.284
Last week it was empanadas.
and empanadas are amazing!

661
00:35:19.284 --> 00:35:22.913
My only regret. it took me
so long to learn that.

662
00:35:22.913 --> 00:35:24.623
Urkelbot likes her show.

663
00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:27.251
Probably a good thing
Urkelbot can't talk.

664
00:35:27.251 --> 00:35:28.544
Or vote.

665
00:35:30.963 --> 00:35:34.967
We just wanted to make sure
you were feeling okay
after you blew up the mall.

666
00:35:34.967 --> 00:35:37.261
He didn't blow up the mall.

667
00:35:37.261 --> 00:35:40.264
Sorry. Just a bunch
of reindeer and Pretzelegance.

668
00:35:40.264 --> 00:35:41.640
which. good riddance.

669
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.185
Ow! Hey. I'm old.

670
00:35:45.185 --> 00:35:48.397
Mr. Kalan's right.
I messed up the mall-idays.

671
00:35:48.397 --> 00:35:50.566
DSS and Robin are mad at me.

672
00:35:50.566 --> 00:35:53.652
But it's not just that.
I mess up everything.

673
00:35:53.652 --> 00:35:56.446
I ruined Jordan's
basketball game
with his friends.

674
00:35:56.446 --> 00:35:58.657
I woke the neighborhood up
super early.

675
00:35:58.657 --> 00:36:01.994
Steve. you're being
too hard on yourself.

676
00:36:01.994 --> 00:36:04.288
Look. you might be a little...

677
00:36:04.288 --> 00:36:06.290
- Awkward?
- Goofy?

678
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.250
A bumbling.
butter-fingered klutz?

679
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.586
I was gonna say. eager.

680
00:36:10.586 --> 00:36:13.881
But we all know
your heart is in
the right place.

681
00:36:13.881 --> 00:36:17.426
{\an8}Dudley Von Durffel said
I should disrupt people's lives
for the better.

682
00:36:17.426 --> 00:36:20.262
{\an8}But when I tried.
I made everything worse.

683
00:36:20.262 --> 00:36:24.099
{\an8}So. I was thinking.
maybe I was disrupting
the wrong thing.

684
00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:28.270
{\an8}Maybe what I need to disrupt
this holiday season is myself.

685
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:30.856
Don't tell me.
you've built a contraption
that's going to turn you

686
00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:34.443
into some sort
of smooth-talking cool guy.

687
00:36:34.443 --> 00:36:35.903
Not at all.

688
00:36:35.903 --> 00:36:38.447
Being cool has
never been my problem.

689
00:36:38.447 --> 00:36:39.531
Whoa!

690
00:36:41.617 --> 00:36:44.244
Behold. my newest invention.

691
00:36:44.244 --> 00:36:46.955
I call it a nice ticker.

692
00:36:46.955 --> 00:36:48.457
It's an okay ticker.

693
00:36:48.457 --> 00:36:50.292
No. it's called a nice ticker.

694
00:36:50.292 --> 00:36:52.628
It will help me make sure
the holidays are great

695
00:36:52.628 --> 00:36:54.796
by keeping me
from screwing them up.

696
00:36:54.796 --> 00:36:58.091
Every year. I go over
to Mr. Kalan's to help him
light his menorah.

697
00:36:58.091 --> 00:37:00.594
- And my drapes.
- Exactly.

698
00:37:00.594 --> 00:37:04.473
So. the watch told me that.
this year. I should send
Urkelbot in my place.

699
00:37:04.473 --> 00:37:06.850
You want me
to celebrate Hanukkah
with your robot?

700
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:10.687
His latkes are delicious.
He makes them with
ricotta cheese.

701
00:37:10.687 --> 00:37:14.483
That sounds
like something from
one of those fancy food shows.

702
00:37:14.483 --> 00:37:18.111
- See. Mr. K's holiday
just got a little better.

703
00:37:18.111 --> 00:37:20.739
The more things I do right.
the more points I'll get

704
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:22.491
while making sure
we stay on track for

705
00:37:22.491 --> 00:37:25.327
a wonderful holiday
that Santa will love!

706
00:37:25.327 --> 00:37:27.204
Oh. Steve.

707
00:37:27.204 --> 00:37:29.998
If you weren't covered
in grease. I'd hug you.

708
00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:33.251
- No. thank you. robot.

709
00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:37.547
Steve. honey.
the holidays are great
because you're a part of them.

710
00:37:37.547 --> 00:37:40.759
Yeah. Steve.
Isn't today Jay-Z's birthday?

711
00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:43.053
Why don't we all
go Jay-Z caroling?

712
00:37:43.053 --> 00:37:45.722
That would be a wonderful thing
we can all do together.

713
00:37:45.722 --> 00:37:48.684
- Hmm. The watch
says I shouldn't.

714
00:37:48.684 --> 00:37:53.105
But. Steve. you love
singing loudly on the street.

715
00:37:53.105 --> 00:37:55.148
You can sing the curse words.

716
00:37:55.148 --> 00:37:56.900
Let's be honest.

717
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.611
I bet I'd get really excited
singing "Hard Knock Life."

718
00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:02.030
and accidentally step
on Mrs. Kochiyama's foot.

719
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.032
which would then
make her jump in pain.

720
00:38:04.032 --> 00:38:06.326
She'd slip on
an icy patch of sidewalk

721
00:38:06.326 --> 00:38:09.287
and go tumbling into Mr. Kalan.
causing him to break his hip.

722
00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:12.749
That does sound like
something you could do.

723
00:38:12.749 --> 00:38:14.668
and something that
my hip could do.

724
00:38:14.668 --> 00:38:16.420
Yep. it all tracks for me.

725
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.672
And then. he'd have
to spend Hanukkah
in the hospital.

726
00:38:18.672 --> 00:38:20.424
So. I'd ruin another holiday.

727
00:38:20.424 --> 00:38:23.593
- See. I'm
already scoring points.

728
00:38:23.593 --> 00:38:25.178
Oh. this is great.

729
00:38:25.178 --> 00:38:27.097
You all go. Have fun.

730
00:38:27.097 --> 00:38:30.350
Okay. but it won't be
the same without you.

731
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:34.354
- According to my data.
it will be 47% better.

732
00:38:34.354 --> 00:38:38.358
Robot. if I fall asleep.
that's not permission for you

733
00:38:38.358 --> 00:38:41.820
to turn my microwave against me
for your robot uprising!

734
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.864
I know what goes on
among youse.

735
00:38:43.864 --> 00:38:46.450
I read books. I got Wi-Fi.

736
00:38:49.411 --> 00:38:50.412
Hey. Urkel. come here.

737
00:38:50.412 --> 00:38:51.913
We could use another player.

738
00:38:51.913 --> 00:38:54.666
This snowman really
isn't playing much D.

739
00:38:54.666 --> 00:38:56.543
- Hmm.

740
00:38:56.543 --> 00:39:00.380
The last time I was here.
I got everybody
soaked with rain.

741
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.966
I should probably
sit this one out. Thanks.

742
00:39:07.888 --> 00:39:11.391
Okay. holiday boy.
we've gone a mile and a half.

743
00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:14.603
and you haven't
sung a single thing.

744
00:39:14.603 --> 00:39:16.855
- What's up. huh?
- You don't like singing.

745
00:39:16.855 --> 00:39:19.775
And I don't
wanna ruin your day.
So. no singing for me.

746
00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.654
So. you're just
gonna sit there all quiet.

747
00:39:24.654 --> 00:39:28.366
even as the wheels on the bus
go round and round?

748
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:31.953
- Round and round.
round and round?

749
00:39:33.663 --> 00:39:36.083
Have a nice evening.
Sheryl. the bus driver.

750
00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:38.960
You. too. holiday boy.

751
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.214
<i>♪ The wipers on the bus
go swish. swish. swish... ♪</i>

752
00:39:42.214 --> 00:39:45.300
- It was cute when
he does it. Jerry. not you!

753
00:39:52.057 --> 00:39:55.185
Hey. Steve.
What are you doing here?

754
00:39:55.185 --> 00:39:58.980
{\an8}I wanted to say sorry
I messed up everything
at Santa's Village.

755
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.192
Thanks. I appreciate that
you came here to apologize.

756
00:40:02.192 --> 00:40:05.195
I know I'm not one
of Santa's official helpers.

757
00:40:05.195 --> 00:40:08.949
But I made you something
that I hope will make
your holiday a little better.

758
00:40:08.949 --> 00:40:13.286
Steve Urkel Industries
proudly presents
my latest invention.

759
00:40:13.286 --> 00:40:15.122
The ESL-met.

760
00:40:15.122 --> 00:40:17.165
It takes
anything you say or hear

761
00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:20.127
and translates it
automatically into
the language of your choice.

762
00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:31.263
If my dad ever needs
to slay a talking dragon

763
00:40:31.263 --> 00:40:32.889
or sing a rap hook.
I'll hit you up.

764
00:40:32.889 --> 00:40:35.308
But I don't think he's much
of a helmet-to-work guy.

765
00:40:44.359 --> 00:40:45.944
That's cool. Steve.

766
00:40:45.944 --> 00:40:50.615
but I wanted to get my dad
ESL classes myself.

767
00:40:50.615 --> 00:40:53.702
Sometimes. he helps me
with my school work.

768
00:40:53.702 --> 00:40:58.331
He'll make up
silly songs to help me
remember math equations.

769
00:40:58.331 --> 00:41:03.003
It's corny. but I like getting
to spend that time with him.

770
00:41:03.003 --> 00:41:04.838
I don't know.
I guess I just figured

771
00:41:04.838 --> 00:41:06.840
it'd be fun
to do the same for him.

772
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.593
Trust me.
I've crunched the numbers
and run simulations.

773
00:41:09.593 --> 00:41:11.511
Your dad is going to love this.

774
00:41:11.511 --> 00:41:13.680
He's going to have
the best Christmas ever.

775
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.724
and you're going to have
a great holiday because of it.

776
00:41:15.724 --> 00:41:17.017
- See?

777
00:41:17.017 --> 00:41:18.935
Is that a step counter?

778
00:41:18.935 --> 00:41:20.395
No.

779
00:41:20.395 --> 00:41:21.897
It's my newest invention
to help me make sure

780
00:41:21.897 --> 00:41:24.024
everyone has
the best holiday ever.

781
00:41:24.024 --> 00:41:27.194
It's keeping score
of everything I do to hack
this holiday season.

782
00:41:27.194 --> 00:41:28.862
Who are you keeping score for?

783
00:41:28.862 --> 00:41:31.114
Santa.

784
00:41:31.114 --> 00:41:34.284
He's only going to come
if everything and everyone
is perfect. Even me.

785
00:41:34.284 --> 00:41:36.536
You'll see.
my science is sound.

786
00:41:36.536 --> 00:41:38.413
Look. your wreath is crooked.

787
00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:39.915
Hm. Looks fine to me.

788
00:41:39.915 --> 00:41:41.917
Nope. It's off
by three degrees.

789
00:41:41.917 --> 00:41:43.710
Now. that might seem small.

790
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:46.087
But it could be the difference
between someone walking by

791
00:41:46.087 --> 00:41:48.256
and feeling joy to the world.

792
00:41:48.256 --> 00:41:51.801
or simply mild satisfaction
with the globe.

793
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:56.264
Joy. mild satisfaction.

794
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:59.976
Joy. mild satisfaction.

795
00:42:01.645 --> 00:42:04.773
Point. no point.

796
00:42:04.773 --> 00:42:07.150

00:44:34.547 --> 00:44:36.257
Happy mall-idays.

842
00:44:36.257 --> 00:44:38.676
I hope you have a wonderful
shopping experience.

843
00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:40.345
Where's that holiday smile?

844
00:44:42.013 --> 00:44:44.682
Hey. Mrs. P.
Doing some malI-iday shopping?

845
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:47.936
Yep. Got all my presents
for my sister's family.

846
00:44:47.936 --> 00:44:51.314
Can I count on you to help me
gift-wrap everything this year?

847
00:44:51.314 --> 00:44:54.526
I'll make eggnog cookies
and we can watch a scary movie.

848
00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:58.279
- My nice ticker reminded me
that I'm bad at wrapping gifts.

849
00:44:58.279 --> 00:45:00.990
Every year. I mess it up
and you have to
rewrap everything

850
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.993
while I eat all the cookies
and fall asleep on your sofa.

851
00:45:03.993 --> 00:45:05.328
I don't mind.

852
00:45:05.328 --> 00:45:07.330
It's nice having your company.

853
00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:10.166
Thanks. But if you want
to have a wonderful holiday.

854
00:45:10.166 --> 00:45:12.252
you need someone or something

855
00:45:12.252 --> 00:45:15.380
that can help you wrap up
those gifts. lickety-split.

856
00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.465
That's why I built you this.

857
00:45:17.465 --> 00:45:20.635
It's a giftwrapping
machine that I call
The Hardcore Wrapper.

858
00:45:20.635 --> 00:45:24.973
It can make paper. mix tape
and get jingly with it. baby.

859
00:45:24.973 --> 00:45:26.766
There's not a box
it can't beat.

860
00:45:27.934 --> 00:45:29.018
Ooh.

861
00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:31.479
What is it?

862
00:45:31.479 --> 00:45:33.690
It's a coffee mug warmer
for my niece.

863
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:36.276
I found it at
that fancy tech store.

864
00:45:36.276 --> 00:45:38.945
You put a cup on it
and it stays warm.

865
00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:40.572
How old is your niece?

866
00:45:40.572 --> 00:45:43.324
She's nine.
Do you think she'll like it?

867
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.663
Sure. Why don't we
get our wrap on?

868
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.128
- Oh. wow. that's wonderful.

869
00:45:55.128 --> 00:45:56.921
Feel free to wrap away.

870
00:45:56.921 --> 00:45:59.299
I need to head inside
and check on DSS.

871
00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:03.887
Look at me.
I'm a hardcore wrapper.

872
00:46:03.887 --> 00:46:05.722
Oh. you don't want
none of this. honey.

873
00:46:05.722 --> 00:46:08.892
I spit bars.
fire. fire bars.

874
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.063
Well. well. well.

875
00:46:14.063 --> 00:46:16.483
if it isn't Mr. Donkey Cheese.

876
00:46:16.483 --> 00:46:18.067
-  Robin!

877
00:46:18.067 --> 00:46:19.903
Hey. DSS.

878
00:46:19.903 --> 00:46:22.906
I just wanted to apologize
for screwing things up.

879
00:46:22.906 --> 00:46:24.115
I'm sorry.

880
00:46:24.115 --> 00:46:25.617
Thanks. Steve.

881
00:46:25.617 --> 00:46:28.828
I'll be honest.
I was mad at you.

882
00:46:28.828 --> 00:46:32.457
But for you to come here now
and apologize to me.

883
00:46:32.457 --> 00:46:34.375
face-to-face...

884
00:46:34.375 --> 00:46:36.169
- Aw. geez...

885
00:46:36.169 --> 00:46:38.338
I said. geez!

886
00:46:38.338 --> 00:46:40.798
What?
It was a touching moment.

887
00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:42.926
To show you how sorry I am.

888
00:46:42.926 --> 00:46:44.594
I wanted to give you something.

889
00:46:44.594 --> 00:46:47.138
That's very nice.
But my doctor said

890
00:46:47.138 --> 00:46:49.474
my heart can't take
any more gifts from you.

891
00:46:49.474 --> 00:46:51.518
Oh. but you're
already wearing it.

892
00:46:51.518 --> 00:46:53.311
I fixed your Santa suit.

893
00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:56.231
You did this?
Thought this was from the mall.

894
00:46:56.231 --> 00:46:57.732
The fit is nice.

895
00:46:57.732 --> 00:46:59.609
Look at your boy.
all swagged out.

896
00:46:59.609 --> 00:47:02.403
You got Santa
looking like a hype piece.

897
00:47:02.403 --> 00:47:05.615
Wait. It's not gonna do
something weird. is it?

898
00:47:05.615 --> 00:47:08.409
Nope. No tech.
Just sewed it up with

899
00:47:08.409 --> 00:47:10.036
- a needle and some thread.

900
00:47:10.036 --> 00:47:13.498
Thanks. Steve.
We're all gravy. and cheese.

901
00:47:16.376 --> 00:47:18.920
Nothing? You're not gonna
take a photo of this 'fit?

902
00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.129
I look good.

903
00:47:20.129 --> 00:47:22.090
Between you and me. DSS.

904
00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:24.342
your suit wasn't in
the best shape to begin with.

905
00:47:24.342 --> 00:47:26.970
So. I reinforced everything
with some synthetic fabric

906
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:29.722
to make sure
it stayed both soft and sturdy.

907
00:47:29.722 --> 00:47:32.433
Synthetic fabric?
Like polyester?

908
00:47:32.433 --> 00:47:34.769
Wow. Steve. I was wrong.

909
00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:36.396
You really are
winning the holidays.

910
00:47:36.396 --> 00:47:38.356
And it's only gonna get better.

911
00:47:38.356 --> 00:47:40.608
This year. we're gonna
knock Santa's socks off.

912
00:47:40.608 --> 00:47:43.570
I'm allergic
to synthetic fabrics.

913
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:44.779
Or his pants.

914
00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:47.115
It's like
super-soft poison ivy!

915
00:47:47.115 --> 00:47:49.617
It's nice and painful.

916
00:47:49.617 --> 00:47:51.744
Aah! When I scratch.
it makes my fingers itchy.

917
00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:52.787
Steve!

918
00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:58.084
Oh. no. I'm
making things worse.

919
00:47:58.084 --> 00:47:59.419
Hold on. Hold on.

920
00:47:59.419 --> 00:48:01.629
I know what to do.
I can fix this.

921
00:48:01.629 --> 00:48:04.632
No!
Don't fix anything!

922
00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:06.217
But... But...

923
00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:09.637
What we need is
someone to disrupt you. Steve.

924
00:48:09.637 --> 00:48:12.265
- Wait a menorah.

925
00:48:13.224 --> 00:48:14.475
I know just the guy.

926
00:48:17.812 --> 00:48:19.772
This guy says
my hair looks fake?

927
00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:21.858
What? [hesitates] No.

928
00:48:21.858 --> 00:48:23.359
Hi-ho. Dudley.

929
00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:27.113
Who are you?
How'd you get here?

930
00:48:27.113 --> 00:48:31.159
Are you one of those ghosts
here to show me my Christmas
past. present. or future?

931
00:48:31.159 --> 00:48:33.494
No. it's me. Steve Urkel.

932
00:48:33.494 --> 00:48:36.247
We met the other day.
fellow disruptor.

933
00:48:36.247 --> 00:48:38.708
- Who?
-@steveurkel.

934
00:48:38.708 --> 00:48:42.295
@steveurkel. IRL?

935
00:48:42.295 --> 00:48:44.797
Uh. okay.
Uh. what can I do for you?

936
00:48:44.797 --> 00:48:47.508
I took your advice and
tried to disrupt the holidays

937
00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:49.469
and make everything
perfect for Santa.

938
00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:51.929
I built this nice ticker
that pushes me to find ways

939
00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:54.307
to make sure everyone
had a great holiday.

940
00:48:54.307 --> 00:48:56.309
But I kept
screwing everything up.

941
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:59.646
Hmm. You've gamified
being in the holiday spirit?

942
00:48:59.646 --> 00:49:03.733
That's fire... emoji.

943
00:49:03.733 --> 00:49:06.402
I don't think the problem
is you. @steveurkel.

944
00:49:06.402 --> 00:49:08.237
It's not?

945
00:49:08.237 --> 00:49:10.907
You turned the holidays
into an amazing game.

946
00:49:10.907 --> 00:49:12.700
But a game is only good

947
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.953
if you can get other people
to play it. too. okay?

948
00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:17.747
What if we
scaled this up a bit?

949
00:49:17.747 --> 00:49:20.124
And got everyone
playing for the holidays?

950
00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:21.668
Exactly.

951
00:49:21.668 --> 00:49:23.378
Maybe we lose the watch
and turn it into an app.

952
00:49:23.378 --> 00:49:25.171
A really nice app?

953
00:49:25.171 --> 00:49:28.508
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
But how about
a Von Durffel app?

954
00:49:28.508 --> 00:49:30.593
Ooh. That's wonderful.

955
00:49:30.593 --> 00:49:33.221
No. kid. it's Von Durffel.

956
00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:35.682
VDI. get the dev team
on this. stat.

957
00:49:35.682 --> 00:49:38.059
- I want this live in 24 hours.

958
00:49:38.059 --> 00:49:39.769
Can you get it ready
in 24 hours?

959
00:49:39.769 --> 00:49:41.604
You're right.
Let's do it in six.

960
00:49:41.604 --> 00:49:43.815
Congratulations. kid.

961
00:49:43.815 --> 00:49:45.692
You're about
to disrupt the world.

962
00:49:48.903 --> 00:49:50.321
You have a question?

963
00:49:50.321 --> 00:49:51.989
No. I was...
I was trying to high-five you.

964
00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:54.534
Oh. It looked like
you had a question.

965
00:49:54.534 --> 00:49:56.369
Maybe angle
your arm down a little more.

966
00:49:56.369 --> 00:50:00.039
Or maybe. I was disrupting
the way we do the high-five.

967
00:50:00.039 --> 00:50:01.749
Very cool.

968
00:50:01.749 --> 00:50:03.626
Thanks.

969
00:50:03.626 --> 00:50:05.878
Now. let's get you
off my boat.

970
00:50:05.878 --> 00:50:09.257
Dudley's app
should be online now.

971
00:50:09.257 --> 00:50:12.844
Oh. wow.
So many people
have already downloaded it.

972
00:50:12.844 --> 00:50:14.262
That's great.

973
00:50:14.262 --> 00:50:16.097
Oh. Santa's gonna
be so proud of me.

974
00:50:16.097 --> 00:50:18.474
Everything's gonna be
so festive that he'll
make sure

975
00:50:18.474 --> 00:50:20.476
this is the best holiday ever.

Ujamaa. bless us. everyone.

987

00:51:36.219 --> 00:51:38.721
You saved the holidays. Steve.

989

Ho-ho-ho. ho!

990
00:51:40.264 --> 00:51:43.100
You're my official
holiday helper.

991
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.894
You hear that. everybody?

992
00:51:44.894 --> 00:51:47.814
- Steve Urkel!

993
00:51:52.151 --> 00:51:54.320
Good morning. Mr. Kalan.

994
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.822
Good morning. Steve.

995
00:51:55.822 --> 00:51:58.032
Just turning
the Kochiyamas' car

996
00:51:58.032 --> 00:52:00.952
into everybody's
favorite Christmas character.

997
00:52:00.952 --> 00:52:02.995
Rudy. the holiday moose.

998
00:52:02.995 --> 00:52:04.997
I think you mean reindeer?

999
00:52:04.997 --> 00:52:08.125
- Their car is a reindeer.
- Moose. reindeer.
what's the difference?

1000
00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:10.002
I mean. they're
different subspecies.

1001
00:52:10.002 --> 00:52:11.963
not to mention.
antler size and shape.

1002
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:16.342
Yes! Seventeen points!

1003
00:52:16.342 --> 00:52:19.136
- Ooh. <i>chag sameach.</i> Mr. Kalan.

1004
00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:22.557
We've spent all morning
perfecting a matzah ball
soup recipe.

1005
00:52:22.557 --> 00:52:24.225
And some rugelach.

1006
00:52:24.225 --> 00:52:27.144
Let's get in that kitchen
and get you a Hanukkah meal.

1007
00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:29.021
- Yes!

1008
00:52:29.021 --> 00:52:31.440
That's so wonderful.

1009
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.443
Did you see Rudy. the moose?

1010
00:52:34.443 --> 00:52:37.947
It's nice. We don't
really celebrate Christmas.
But thank you.

1011
00:52:39.365 --> 00:52:41.200
I got you. Kochiyamas.

1012
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.828
For the new year.
you celebrate with
a kagami mochi.

1013
00:52:43.828 --> 00:52:46.455
- And I made you
a lawn ornament.

1014
00:52:46.455 --> 00:52:48.249
-  Yes!

1015
00:52:48.249 --> 00:52:51.002
Take that. Mr. Kalan.

1016
00:52:51.002 --> 00:52:53.921
Livingstons. you
celebrate Kwanzaa. right?

1017
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:55.381
Let me help you do that!

1018
00:52:55.381 --> 00:52:58.718
- Happy holiday. Steve.

1019
00:52:58.718 --> 00:53:01.679
I said it first.
Why didn't I get more points?

1020
00:53:01.679 --> 00:53:04.932
{\an8}No. Horace.
I insist your team
have the ball.

1021
00:53:04.932 --> 00:53:07.518
{\an8}- Happy holidays.

1022
00:53:07.518 --> 00:53:10.021
{\an8}- Oh. thank you very much.

1023
00:53:12.106 --> 00:53:14.150
{\an8}Look at that.
It's your ball again.

1024
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.235
{\an8}- I think that counts
as a Christmas gift.

1025
00:53:16.235 --> 00:53:18.321
Hey. Jordan. what's the score?

1026
00:53:18.321 --> 00:53:19.822
Oh. nothing-to-nothing.

1027
00:53:19.822 --> 00:53:22.867
But I've already got
38 Von Durffel points.

1028
00:53:22.867 --> 00:53:24.327
But what about basketball?

1029
00:53:24.327 --> 00:53:26.037
This is better than basketball.

1030
00:53:28.039 --> 00:53:31.792
Oh. look at that.
I accidentally
scored on myself.

1031
00:53:31.792 --> 00:53:35.755
- That's two points for you.
Horace and ten points for me.

1032
00:53:35.755 --> 00:53:38.466
For being so charitable
this holiday season.

1033
00:53:44.305 --> 00:53:47.934
Hey. holiday boy. Need a lift?

1034
00:53:47.934 --> 00:53:50.394
<i>♪ Dashing through the snow ♪</i>

1035
00:53:50.394 --> 00:53:52.021
- I'm good.

1036
00:54:04.325 --> 00:54:06.369
- Happy holidays.

1037
00:54:06.369 --> 00:54:10.665
Merry Christmas. Hanukkah.
Boxing Day. Kwanzaa.
Festivus to you.

1038
00:54:12.291 --> 00:54:14.168
Your smile
just brightened my day

1039
00:54:14.168 --> 00:54:15.920
- this holiday season.

1040
00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.339
Your smile is
all the Christmas. Hanukkah.

1041
00:54:18.339 --> 00:54:21.926
Boxing Day. Kwanzaa.
Solstice. Festivus gift I need.

1042
00:54:21.926 --> 00:54:24.512
- A fabulous day to you.

1043
00:54:24.512 --> 00:54:27.473
Would you stop. Gary?
You're messing up my points.

1044
00:54:27.473 --> 00:54:31.185
You're not being very merry
by telling me what to do.

1045
00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:35.982
I don't care what your grades are. You.
young man. deserve a puppy.

1046
00:54:35.982 --> 00:54:39.026
You hear that? This little boy
is getting a puppy.

1047
00:54:39.026 --> 00:54:41.404
even if Santa
has to get you one himself.

1048
00:54:41.404 --> 00:54:44.991
- Isn't that nice
of Santa?

1049
00:54:44.991 --> 00:54:46.909
Yes. A hundred points.

1050
00:54:46.909 --> 00:54:49.036
Okay. come on.
give me another kid.
Give me another kid.

1051
00:54:49.036 --> 00:54:50.746
Whoa-ho-ho.

1052
00:54:50.746 --> 00:54:54.125
- Whatever you want. little girl. Santa's
got you covered. You want world peace?
Santa will figure it out.

1053
00:54:54.125 --> 00:54:55.167
Oh. Steve!

1054
00:54:57.378 --> 00:55:00.589
You want to rip my pants off
again. make me look silly?

1055
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:04.176
Isn't that
a holly-jolly good time?

1056
00:55:04.176 --> 00:55:06.887
- What's going on?

1057
00:55:06.887 --> 00:55:09.515
I don't know you.
but I got you
this holiday card.

1058
00:55:09.515 --> 00:55:11.934
I got you one first.
Season's greetings!

1059
00:55:13.269 --> 00:55:14.937
I don't believe this.

1060
00:55:14.937 --> 00:55:17.189
These people aren't
spreading holiday cheer.

1061
00:55:17.189 --> 00:55:19.734
They're more focused
on treating it like a game.

1062
00:55:19.734 --> 00:55:21.610
Isn't that what you were doing?

1063
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:24.196
No. I was just trying to...

1064
00:55:24.196 --> 00:55:28.451
win over Santa
by getting a perfect score.

1065
00:55:29.368 --> 00:55:31.245
Oh. no.

1066
00:55:31.245 --> 00:55:33.539
Did I do this?

1067
00:55:39.628 --> 00:55:41.672
- Hey. kid. let's go caroling.

1068
00:55:41.672 --> 00:55:45.468
Everyone loves caroling.
and it'll give me some points.

1069
00:55:45.468 --> 00:55:47.720
Do you even wanna go caroling?

1070
00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.597
No. I just want points.

1071
00:55:50.473 --> 00:55:52.224
Points!

1072
00:55:52.224 --> 00:55:54.852
No! I need those points.

1073
00:55:54.852 --> 00:55:56.187
Let's make a gingerbread house.

1074
00:55:56.187 --> 00:55:57.855
Let's make
ten gingerbread houses.

1075
00:55:57.855 --> 00:55:59.648
Let's make a gingerbread city!

1076
00:55:59.648 --> 00:56:02.151
No. he's going
caroling with me.

1077
00:56:02.151 --> 00:56:04.487
Fun fact. Did you know
the fifth day of Kwanzaa

1078
00:56:04.487 --> 00:56:07.198
is all about points?

1079
00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:16.999
This game is offering
daily cash prizes

1080
00:56:16.999 --> 00:56:18.667
and a million dollars
to the person

1081
00:56:18.667 --> 00:56:21.504
who gets the highest score
of the month!

1082
00:56:21.504 --> 00:56:23.422
What? No.

1083
00:56:23.422 --> 00:56:26.300
Dudley's app is bribing people
to get into the holiday spirit.

1084
00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.927
This isn't right.

1085
00:56:27.927 --> 00:56:30.679
Maybe not. but it only
costs a few bucks to play.

1086
00:56:30.679 --> 00:56:33.182
and if I win. I could get paid.

1087
00:56:33.182 --> 00:56:34.600
Robin...

1088
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.812
No...

1089
00:56:42.733 --> 00:56:44.610
Happy holiday. Steve.

1090
00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.779
Where's that holiday smile?

1091
00:56:46.779 --> 00:56:49.698
You're one of Santa's
holiday helpers. aren't you?

1092
00:56:49.698 --> 00:56:52.118
- We should get you a hat.

1093
00:56:52.118 --> 00:56:53.953
Let's get you some eggnog

1094
00:56:53.953 --> 00:56:57.373
and sing some
carols.

1095
00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:02.586
Hey. there. Steve.
You still want
donkey cheese for Christmas?

1096
00:57:02.586 --> 00:57:04.672
Because I'll get it for you.

1097
00:57:04.672 --> 00:57:07.216
- If I win this game.
I'll buy you all the cheese.

1098
00:57:07.216 --> 00:57:09.301
So why don't you
sing some carols with me.

1099
00:57:09.301 --> 00:57:11.053
and I can get these points?

1100
00:57:11.053 --> 00:57:12.179
Oh. no!

1101
00:57:12.179 --> 00:57:14.640
Points...

1102
00:57:16.308 --> 00:57:19.311
The mall is getting
the biggest tree we can find.

1103
00:57:19.311 --> 00:57:20.729
- just for you.

1104
00:57:20.729 --> 00:57:22.356
Will you help us decorate it

1105
00:57:22.356 --> 00:57:25.109
for the points?

1106
00:57:30.322 --> 00:57:32.158
Where's your
ugly sweater? Points.

1107
00:57:32.158 --> 00:57:34.618
Want to watch some
holiday movies on my phone?

1108
00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:36.871
For points.

1109
00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:42.168
Points...

1110
00:57:42.168 --> 00:57:44.753
Steve. I think
your sweater isn't
the right Christmas green.

1111
00:57:44.753 --> 00:57:47.006
- It needs to be
a shade lighter.

1112
00:57:47.006 --> 00:57:49.675
- Take a seat and let me
tell you the story of Hanukkah.

1113
00:57:49.675 --> 00:57:52.094
- It's known as
the Festival of Lights.

1114
00:57:52.094 --> 00:57:54.722
Points...

1115
00:57:54.722 --> 00:57:56.765
-  Points...

1116
00:57:58.726 --> 00:58:01.312
Come on! I built you.
Why aren't you starting?

1117
00:58:01.312 --> 00:58:05.399
Points. points...

1118
00:58:05.399 --> 00:58:07.234
- That is very cool.

1119
00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:10.529
It's a Christmas mitzvah.
how you mess with my things.

1120
00:58:10.529 --> 00:58:12.406
Oh. come on. Come on.

1121
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:19.830
I'll bring it back. I promise!

1122
00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:23.292
- Or don't. I'm generous
and charitable that way.

1123
00:58:23.292 --> 00:58:26.462
As long as I get these points.

1124
00:58:27.338 --> 00:58:28.589
Yes.

1125
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:30.341
Would you like
to sing a carol with me?

1126
00:58:30.341 --> 00:58:32.468
- I thought you'd never ask.

1153
01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:19.658
Where am I?

1154
01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:33.630
Kid. calm down. please.

1155
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:34.840
You can talk?

1156
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.593
Yes. You've got
good aim. Steve.

1157
01:00:37.593 --> 01:00:40.012
Well. only when I'm terrified.

1158
01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:42.514
Wait. how do you know my name?

1159
01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.850
I know every kid's name.

1160
01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:47.895
It's kind of my thing.
being Santa and all.

1161
01:00:47.895 --> 01:00:49.563
You're Santa Claus?

1162
01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:51.440
In the fur.

1163
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.567
You're a...

1164
01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.736
Yes. Steve Urkel.

1165
01:00:55.736 --> 01:00:57.571
Santa Claus is a yeti!

1166
01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:02.201
No. no. no. no. no.
That's ridiculous.

1167
01:01:02.201 --> 01:01:03.952
I've been
helping Santa for years.

1168
01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:06.288
Officially. or off the books?

1169
01:01:06.288 --> 01:01:07.873
That's not important.

1170
01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:10.667
As a self-taught Santa expert.

1171
01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.419
Santa can't be a yeti.

1180
01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:40.489
But there's never been
scientific proof
of your existence.

1181
01:01:40.489 --> 01:01:42.116
Not Santa Claus. Yetis.

1182
01:01:42.116 --> 01:01:43.992
Ouch! That hurts.

1183
01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:47.371
Uh. I guess you know a lot of
centuries-old humans.

1184
01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.081
Well. my grandma's
pretty old.

1185
01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:51.500
But can she fit down a chimney
carrying a bag of toys

1186
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.835
without being seen?

1187
01:01:52.835 --> 01:01:56.046
I can. It's what
we Bigfoots are great at.

1188
01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:58.090
Doors. on the other hand.
confuse the heck out of me.

1189
01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.759
Turn and pull
and then go in.
Oh.

1190
01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:03.804
Wait a minute.
People have seen
Santa before.

1191
01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:06.098
I try to stay hidden
as much as possible.

1192
01:02:06.098 --> 01:02:12.187
but a few lucky children
have gazed upon
this beautiful visage.

1193
01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:16.024
So by now.
somebody would have said
Santa's a yeti

1194
01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:19.153
or gotten upset
that you don't look like
a biker after a spa day.

Not just any old man.

1205
01:02:41.383 --> 01:02:42.926
They want to see
the one who's--

1206
01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:47.264
White. uh. fur
can kind of look like a beard.

1207
01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.348
Don't you think?

1208
01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:50.434
Hmm. It does.

1209
01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:52.394
And I guess
from far enough away.

1210
01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:55.814
your hands and feet
kind of look like
boots and gloves.

1211
01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:57.524
Exactly!

1212
01:02:57.524 --> 01:03:00.235
I mean. "claws" is right there
in the name. Santa Claus.

1213
01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:01.612
Hello!

1214
01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:04.323
How many humans
do you know named Santa?

1215
01:03:04.323 --> 01:03:07.451
It's actually
an old yeti word.

1216
01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:10.287
It means yeti.

1217
01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:12.456
My real name
is Krisskringel.

1218
01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:13.707
Holy moly!

1219
01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:15.709
You're Santa
and you're a yeti!

1220
01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:17.628

No.

1238
01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:54.289
Santa. I. uh...

1239
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.291
I may have screwed up
the holidays.

1240
01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:59.586
It's okay.
I have other cookies.

1241
01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:02.256
Now. what brings you
to the North Pole?

1242
01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:03.757
Haven't you seen?

1243
01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:05.759
I messed up everything
back home.

1244
01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:08.136
I kind of blew up
the mall. twice.

1245
01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:10.889
I built a game-changing.
holiday-ruining app.

1246
01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:13.392
I turned
Department Store Santa
into a meme.

1247
01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:15.936
People are calling him
No Pantsa Claus.

1248
01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:18.522
Sorry. I don't have
Wi-Fi up here.

1249
01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:21.358
but I'd have maybe gone
with Santa Drawers.

1250
01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:24.611
Santa. I was trying so hard
to impress you this year

1251
01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:26.572
that I wrecked everything!

1252
01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:28.657
Why were you trying
to impress me?

1253
01:04:28.657 --> 01:04:30.659
Because you're Santa.

1254
01:04:30.659 --> 01:04:32.244
The Santa Claus.

1255
01:04:32.244 --> 01:04:33.954
You're amazing!

1256
01:04:33.954 --> 01:04:36.331
And you're only going to come
if everything is perfect.

1257
01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:38.834
The lights.
the cheer. even me.

1258
01:04:38.834 --> 01:04:41.461
I built this watch
to make sure I did
everything right

1259
01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:42.838
and bring you to Chicago

1260
01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:44.756
and fulfill everyone's
Christmas wishes.

1261
01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:47.384
Hmm.
What do you want this year?

1262
01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:51.138
Some Serbian donkey cheese.
if I remember correctly.

1263
01:04:51.138 --> 01:04:54.516
{\an8}Right now. my wish would be
to fix everything back home.

1264
01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:56.560
And I clearly
haven't earned that.

1265
01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.314
Well. between you and me.
I'm not really keeping score

1266
01:05:00.314 --> 01:05:02.149

naughty or nice.

1267
01:05:02.149 --> 01:05:03.567

I mean. don't all the
Department Store Santas
report back to you?

1318
01:09:03.849 --> 01:09:07.060
Sure. but just to
tell me what things
kids want this year.

1319
01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.813
I don't want to make
a bunch of wagons
if kids aren't into them.

1320
01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:13.900
The elves hate
when wagons go to waste.

1321
01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:16.528
I still messed up
pretty bad.

1322
01:09:16.528 --> 01:09:19.364
I don't think anyone
will ever forgive me.

1323
01:09:19.364 --> 01:09:22.075
You won't know
unless you try.

1324
01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:23.618
I'm scared to go home.

1325
01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:26.705
What if I
ruin things again?

1326
01:09:26.705 --> 01:09:28.665
Maybe I can stay here.

1327
01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:30.709
officially become
one of your helpers.

1328
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:32.627
I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

1329
01:09:35.881 --> 01:09:37.465
Oh.

1330
01:09:45.307 --> 01:09:46.933

an application fee?

1331
01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:48.351
Uh. no.

1332
01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:50.687
I mean. are you just
going to run away?

1333
01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.355
Won't people miss you?

1334
01:09:52.355 --> 01:09:54.649
No. They're better off
without me.

1335
01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:56.359
You sure about that?

1336
01:09:56.359 --> 01:10:00.530
Steve. why do you celebrate
every December holiday?

1337
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:03.366
You're not Jewish.
and yet you help Mr. Kalan

1338
01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.493
celebrate Hanukkah
every year.

1339
01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:07.245
And on New Year's Eve.
you're always helping

1340
01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:10.373
the Kochiyama family
clean their house
for Omisoka.

1341
01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:12.208
Because Mr. Kalan's
my friend.

1342
01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:15.128
and he shouldn't
have to celebrate
the holidays by himself.

1343
01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:17.130
And the Kochiyama family
matter to me.

1344
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:19.591
so I just want to know
what's special
and important to them.

1345
01:10:19.591 --> 01:10:21.635
Kid. those are nicer gifts
than anything

1346
01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:23.637
this freakishly
beautiful yeti

1347
01:10:23.637 --> 01:10:25.805
in a red suit
could ever build.

1348
01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:28.141
- You might be a little--
- Eager?

1349
01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:31.394
But as long as you care
about the people around you.

1350
01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:35.106
then you're officially
helping me spread
holiday cheer.

1351
01:10:35.106 --> 01:10:37.150
It's not about how many
lights you put up

1352
01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:40.028
or how many cookies
you leave out.

1353
01:10:40.028 --> 01:10:41.821
Although the more
the merrier.

1354
01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:43.657
You're right. Santa.

1355
01:10:43.657 --> 01:10:45.325
And if I really care.

1356
01:10:45.325 --> 01:10:47.953
then I need to go back home
and clean up my mess.

1357
01:10:47.953 --> 01:10:50.205
See. Steve.
you don't need a watch

1358
01:10:50.205 --> 01:10:52.374
to tell you
the right thing to do.

1359
01:10:52.374 --> 01:10:55.961
Dudley's got everybody
fake celebrating the holidays
to win money.

1360
01:10:55.961 --> 01:10:58.546
Maybe I can build
some kind of mind ray.

1361
01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:01.299
Not control.
but maybe just reprogramming.

1362
01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:03.802
And maybe erasing
some of their
short-term memory.

1363
01:11:03.802 --> 01:11:05.428
It shouldn't hurt too much.

1364
01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:08.556
Hmm. But maybe
you could use an assist.

1365
01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:10.225
This holiday season.

1366
01:11:10.225 --> 01:11:13.395
could I be your unofficial
official helper?

1367
01:11:13.395 --> 01:11:15.438
You want to be my helper?

1368
01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:17.482
Santa's my helper?

1369
01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:19.234
Oh. wow!

1370
01:11:19.234 --> 01:11:21.528
Well. I should probably
get you an orientation packet.

1371
01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:23.655
- and there will be
a strict dress code.
- Steve.

1372
01:11:23.655 --> 01:11:26.366
Or how about
just a lift back home
to shut Dudley's app down

1373
01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:28.868
and remind people
to just be good
for goodness sake?

1374
01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:30.328
Oh. you better watch out.

1375
01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:31.955
<i>♪ You better not pout ♪</i>

1376
01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:35.417
No. watch out.
My reindeer are pulling up.

1377
01:11:38.837 --> 01:11:40.839
Wanna go fix
the holidays?

1378
01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:41.923
Yes!

1379
01:11:46.511 --> 01:11:48.013
What was that song
you were singing?

1380
01:11:48.013 --> 01:11:50.306
"Santa Claus
Is Coming To Town."

1381
01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.559
- Who sings it?
- Everybody.

1382
01:11:52.559 --> 01:11:55.645
Have you never heard
any of the Christmas carols
people sing about you?

1383
01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:58.606
No.
I don't have the Internet.

1384
01:11:58.606 --> 01:12:00.775
And I'm not
that self-absorbed.

1385
01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.486
Are they good songs?

1386
01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:05.363
What if we change
the value of points

1387
01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:08.658
based on how many people
are using the app
at a certain time?

1388
01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:11.077
We'd call it
surge nicing.

1389
01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:12.746
<i>Ethically questionable.</i>

1390
01:12:12.746 --> 01:12:14.914
<i>But business wise.
it will make you richer.</i>

1391
01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:17.792
Perfect.
L-O-L-O-L-O-L.

1392
01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:18.960
Whoa!

1393
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.628
Stop!

1394
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:25.925
@steveurkel?
And a Bigfoot?

1395
01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:27.594
Hey. I'm Santa!

1396
01:12:27.594 --> 01:12:30.221
Whoa! Santa's a Bigfoot?

1397
01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:32.223
Explosion emoji. man.

1398
01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:34.184
You just disrupted
my mind right there. Wow.

1399
01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:36.603
Dudley. we've got
to shut the app down.

1400
01:12:36.603 --> 01:12:39.230
We've turned everyone into
a bunch of holiday zombies

1401
01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:41.691
that are only pretending
to be nice to get a reward.

1402
01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.860
I know.
I am on the precipice

1403
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:46.613
of something #epic.

1404
01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:51.576
For a reward.
I'm getting people
to do whatever I want.

1405
01:12:51.576 --> 01:12:53.870
I can make them
be merry if I want.

1406
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.789
But why stop
at the holidays?

1407
01:12:55.789 --> 01:12:57.874
I could also tell them
what to buy.

1408
01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:00.877
or how to think
or how to vote.

1409
01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:03.296
The possibilities
are endless.

1410
01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:04.714
Well. aren't we
supposed to be

1411
01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.674
disrupting people's lives
for the better?

1412
01:13:06.674 --> 01:13:08.718
Uh. yeah.

1413
01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:10.845
And what's better
than getting everyone
to do what I tell them?

1414
01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:12.347
I'm a genius.

1415
01:13:12.347 --> 01:13:14.099
I'm changing the world.

1416
01:13:14.099 --> 01:13:15.642
I'd be like Santa.

1417
01:13:15.642 --> 01:13:17.811
but year around
and with way better hair.

1418
01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:21.481
Excuse me?
Have you seen these locks?

1419
01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:23.983
What you're doing
is nothing like Santa.

1420
01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.277
Oh. please.
Isn't that what Christmas is?

1421
01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:29.489
You just pretend to be nice
to get a dolly or a video game.

1422
01:13:29.489 --> 01:13:32.575
All to please a reclusive.
well-resourced mogul

1423
01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.702
who lives
in a hard-to-reach place.

1424
01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:39.457
Say hey with five "Y"s
to your new Santa.

1425
01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:42.418
Oh. no. That's cultural
appropriation. honey.

1426
01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.087
This is a mistake!

1427
01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:45.672
I want my tech back.

1428
01:13:45.672 --> 01:13:47.090
Uh. remember when
I sang you a song

1429
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:48.883
about moving fast
and breaking things?

1430
01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:51.386
Well. I've got another song
I'd like to sing for you.

1431
01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:54.347
It's called "No Backsies."
And a one. a two--

1432
01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:55.640
No!

1433
01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.475
If you're not going
to shut it down.

1434
01:13:57.475 --> 01:13:59.936
then I'll have
to shut you down.

1435
01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:03.189
You ever see that GIF
where someone's like.
"Come. Get some."

1436
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:04.732
I'm about to make
one of my own.

1437
01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.945
Are you sure
about this. Steve?

1438
01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:11.281
You're a little boy.
he's a grown adult.

1439
01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.367
That escalated quickly.

1440
01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.081
Huh?

1441
01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:25.211
Well. I did not
see that coming.

1442
01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.881
<i>It's how real Gs
settle their differences.</i>

1443
01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:31.634
<i>When the "G"
stands for genius.</i>

1444
01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:35.722
Seeing as how
you're an uninvited guest
on my yacht air balloon.

1445
01:14:35.722 --> 01:14:38.558
I'll give you the honor
of going first.

1446
01:14:38.558 --> 01:14:39.976
Big mistake.

1447
01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:45.231
People are selfish.
@steveurkel.

1448
01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:49.277
They only want to be nice
to get something.

1449
01:14:49.277 --> 01:14:52.071
- You are wrong. Dudley!
-  Whoa!

1450
01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:54.532
Hmm.

1451
01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:56.659
Uh-oh.

1452
01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:59.370
Ah!

1453
01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:06.794
Whoopsie.

1454
01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:11.007
A-ha!

1455
01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:24.938
{\an8}I'm just making
some extra money
to get my dad a gift.

1456
01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:26.439
{\an8}This is better
than basketball.

1457
01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:28.733
{\an8}You want me to celebrate
Hanukkah with your robot?

1458
01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:30.193
{\an8}Donkey cheese.

1459
01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:34.989
What?

1460
01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:39.327
-  Ah!
- Hey!

1461
01:15:41.246 --> 01:15:42.247
Ho-ho-ho.

1462
01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:52.423
Check and mate.

1463
01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:58.179
Skull emoji.

1464
01:15:59.973 --> 01:16:00.932
Oh.

1465
01:16:00.932 --> 01:16:02.809
Did I do that?

1466
01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:04.769
I think I did.

1467
01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:07.522
Yeah! Oh!

1468
01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:19.325
Uh-oh.

1469
01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:24.080
Oh. no! Please no!

1470
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:31.296
Well. that doesn't
look good.

1471
01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:56.070
Is everyone okay?

1472
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:57.322
Oh. Santa.

1473
01:16:57.322 --> 01:16:59.824
No. Steve. I'm fine.

1474
01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:02.493
Magical being. remember?

1475
01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:05.496
Dudley. I'm sorry
I broke your ship.

1476
01:17:05.496 --> 01:17:07.623
You know. I can work it off
to pay you back.

1477
01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:11.836
All the money I made
from the Von Durffel app
kind of makes us even.

1478
01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:14.255
If you had asked
for even a small cut...

1479
01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:16.716
Ow!
...you'd be rich.

1480
01:17:16.716 --> 01:17:18.468
But...

1481
01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:22.096
<i>♪ No backsies
That's what I said. No... ♪</i>

1482
01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:24.057
I forget the rest.
but it's really cool.

1483
01:17:24.057 --> 01:17:26.642
I don't invent things
to get rich.

1484
01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:29.645
I do it to bring happiness
to people.

1485
01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:33.441
ROTFL.

1486
01:17:33.441 --> 01:17:36.361
Happiness is overrated.
@steveurkel.

1487
01:17:36.361 --> 01:17:39.072
People have already
had a taste of the future.

1488
01:17:39.072 --> 01:17:41.032
and they're not going back.

1489
01:17:41.032 --> 01:17:43.743
This is the future. okay?

1490
01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:45.453
Embrace it.

1491
01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:47.789
Your old ideas
about being nice

1492
01:17:47.789 --> 01:17:50.416
have been disrupted
by something better.

1493
01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:52.418
by someone better.

1494
01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:54.754
By me!

1495
01:17:56.923 --> 01:17:59.133
What's going on?
Did the app crash?

1496
01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:01.177
Will these points count?
I need my points!

1497
01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:04.055
Points!

1498
01:18:04.055 --> 01:18:06.140
I can't finish
these decorations
if I don't have my points.

1499
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.101
Mrs. P. stop!

1500
01:18:08.101 --> 01:18:11.270
You don't need to hang
Mr. Kalan's lights
for points.

1501
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:12.355
Yes. I do!

1502
01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:14.399
Why else would I do this?

1503
01:18:14.399 --> 01:18:16.484
Because he's your neighbor.

1504
01:18:16.484 --> 01:18:19.070
And even though
you two argue sometimes.

1505
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:23.074
you worry about him
climbing on a ladder
because he's so old.

1506
01:18:23.074 --> 01:18:24.700
Hey. words hurt!

1507
01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:29.330
That's not winning you
any holiday cheer points.

1508
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.958
Being nice
isn't a game to win.

1509
01:18:31.958 --> 01:18:33.626
I see that now.

1510
01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:36.546
The holidays aren't something
we do for points.

1511
01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:38.714
Points.

1512
01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:42.343
We celebrate the holidays
because it's an excuse
to check in on someone

1513
01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:43.636
when they have a bad day

1514
01:18:43.636 --> 01:18:45.888
and offer
to take him caroling.

1515
01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:48.182
Being with a friend
to celebrate Hanukkah

1516
01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:50.726
because you enjoy
each other's company.

1517
01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:53.813
It's not a bunch
of empty gestures
to win a prize.

1518
01:18:53.813 --> 01:18:55.940
Points?

1519
01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.776
<i>It's celebrating each day
like a holiday.</i>

1520
01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:01.612
Because the people
around us are gifts.

1521
01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:03.239
Wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

1522
01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:04.907
How is he broadcasting
from the Von Durffel game?

1523
01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:07.577
Magical being. honey.
Boop!

1524
01:19:07.577 --> 01:19:10.079
It's not about
proving how good we are.

1525
01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:12.665
but recognizing
how lucky we are.

1526
01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:14.542
Presents and treats
are great.

1527
01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:16.169
but the holidays
are a reminder

1528
01:19:16.169 --> 01:19:18.504
of how important we are
to one another.

1529
01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:21.007
Wow. you're still corny.

1530
01:19:24.469 --> 01:19:28.014
The nicest thing you can do
is to celebrate each other.

1531
01:19:28.014 --> 01:19:30.308
That's why I love
December so much.

1532
01:19:30.308 --> 01:19:31.601
Holiday boy!

1533
01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:33.978
Were you
about to sing?

1534
01:19:33.978 --> 01:19:35.354
Uh. yes.

1535
01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:38.191

decorated for Soyal?

until you decorate
your house.

you silly goose.

on everybody else.

01:23:07.191 --> 01:23:09.860
I'm really excited
about my light display
this year.

1605
01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:12.071
I hooked it up
to a solar battery

1606
01:23:12.071 --> 01:23:14.740
so you don't have to worry
about blowing out the power
to the street.

1607
01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.033
Unlike last year.

1608
01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:27.545
Did I do that?

1609
01:23:40.808 --> 01:23:42.226
