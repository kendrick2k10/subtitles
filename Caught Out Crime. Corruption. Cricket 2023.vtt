<i>Gambling is a part of life.</i>

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.200
<i>If not cricket.
people would bet on something else.</i>

only by being illegal.</i>

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.840
<i>We are villains. we are not heroes.</i>

8
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.040
[Aniruddha Bahal. in English]
I'm passionate about cricket

9
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.960
like any Indian.

10
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.200
The game is a beautiful game.

11
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.480
Poetry in motion.

12
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.520
So. when I started sports reporting.

13
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.720
I never imagined that I would be
breaking the lid off anything.

14
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.920
[commentator 1] <i>And India's captain
has reached his half-century.</i>

15
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.000
[commentator 2] <i>That is out.</i>

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.640
[Bahal] For the millions of fans.
these players were put on pedestals.

17
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.360
They were gods.

18
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.640
[phones ringing]

19
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640
But human beings are. uh. fallible.

20
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.520
And when I started digging.

21
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.120
I found that. in truth.

22
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.360
it was a very different game

23
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.640
and a very ugly game.

24
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.960

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.720
You just get really angry.
You just get so pissed off.

<i>What will happen next

29
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.000
[Ravi Sawani] The kind of allegations
being made.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.840
they were absolutely unbelievable.

31
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.840
[Minty Tejpal] We came up with this plan
to target and trap the cricketers

32
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.920
using spy cam equipment.
and get the truth out.

33

[people shouting]

34
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.440
Treachery.

35
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.000
Like you've been stabbed in the back.

36
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.880

[commentator 1] <i>Lovely shot.
Glorious shot!</i>

39
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.280
[Sharda Ugra] The '90s was the era
of superstardom in Indian cricket.

40
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.360
[commentator 2] <i>And he's picked that up
very cleanly.</i>

41
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.400
{\an8}They became
as famous and important as film stars.

[commentator 2] <i>What a wonderful catch!
That's a brilliant catch!</i>

43
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.360
{\an8}The unpredictability.
the beauty of it. the suspense unraveling...

44
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.560
Anything could happen.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.520
[commentator 2] <i>Trouble! Big trouble.</i>

46
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.120
[Karri] It didn't matter who you are.
where you came from.

47
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.080
you can be the hero of the whole country.

48
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.680
[Ugra] We wanted to follow our stars.

49
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.160
[all chanting] India! India!

50
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.760
We saw almost
a utopian version of what cricket is.

51
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.000
But when it came to issues
around gambling. I was completely naÃ¯ve.

52
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.280
Betting is illegal in India.

53
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.840
So when we started hearing about bookies.

54
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.000
we knew it wasn't good stuff.

55
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.240
but we were just rookie reporters.
We didn't know what was going on.

56
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.400
We needed someone
to just unravel everything.

57
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.000
[Bahal] Nobody sees the world
as an investigative reporter.

58
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.720
See. initially.
I never used to cover sports.

59
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.839
Then. uh. one of our journalists
in <i>Outlook.</i> I think. he fell sick.

60
00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:27.600
And so. I became
a sports reporter by accident.

61
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.120
So I was always an outsider.

62
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.680
I had few individual friends.

63
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.360
but I was never
part of that club. so to speak.

64
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.400
They never broke stories.

65
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.920
They never pointed
the finger at negative stuff.

66
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.680
And I felt that
they owed their audience much more.

67
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.560
[crowd cheering]

68
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.560
I remember '97...

69
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.040
I was sitting in the press box.

70
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.520
and I noticed there was
a whole sort of atmosphere of tension.

71
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.600
[phone ringing]

72
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.040
What was strange

73
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.080
was some of the journalists
would. uh. start getting calls.

74
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.400
They were talking about
what would happen in the match.

75
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.560
who is being dropped.
who is not being dropped.

76
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.400
how is the pitch going to behave.

77
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.880
He was giving them odds.

78
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.000
And then I realized that.
"Oh. man! The calls were from bookies."

79
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.120
[phones ringing]

80
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.080
You're not supposed to be
talking to bookies from the press box.

81
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.280
That's an ethical concern.

82
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.120
I felt a sense of outrage about it.

83
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.400
That set me thinking.
"What the hell is happening?"

84
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.880
How deep does it go? How big is the money?

85
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.560
So. I then started digging. so to speak.

86
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.320
And I managed to find some bookies.

87
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.920
They wouldn't allow me
to film them or take photographs.

88
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.280
In fact.
they didn't even tell us their names.

89
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.320
But eventually.
some of them were willing to talk.

90
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.880
[bookie. in Hindi] <i>Every bookie
starts out as a punter.</i>

91
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.000
<i>In college. I had many vices.
but no money.</i>

92
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.760
<i>Gambling was the quick fix.</i>

93
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.200
<i>When I got addicted to money.
I started making others play.</i>

94

95
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.720
<i>To kickstart the work.
we need a whole team.</i>

96
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.200
<i>Many people call this a bookie den.</i>

97
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.760
<i>We call it a shop.</i>

98
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.920
[phones ringing]

99
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.120
[in English] It used to be a madhouse.
And the phones used to be all abuzz.

100
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.440
{\an8}Wickets falling. runs being made.
the odds would keep changing.

101
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.080
So. back then.
it all used to run on trust.

102
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.560
They have to know who you are
for them to accept your bets.

103
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.720
[bookie. in Hindi] <i>Everyone is betting.</i>

104
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.520
<i>Maybe a shopkeeper. maybe a bank manager.</i>

105
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.240
<i>even college students. especially girls.</i>

106
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.200
<i>They think. "Yes. I can win this."</i>

107
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.560
<i>It is a craze.
Everybody wants to become rich.</i>

108
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.240
[in English] It was alarming. I remember
some of them used to record those calls.

109
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.080
so the punters couldn't
go back on what they had bet on.

110
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.000
{\an8}[bookie. in Hindi] <i>If you try
to swindle us. you'll be in danger.</i>

112
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.160
<i>The bookie never loses.</i>

113
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.120
<i>This is the truth.</i>

114
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.720
[phones continue ringing]

115
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.240
[Ugra. in English] There was
a great appetite for gambling.

116
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.200
and it was pan-Indian like cricket.

117
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.280
You could bet on anything.

118
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.160
So. what is the team score
going to be after ten overs?

119
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.720
How many sixes
is a particular batsman going to hit?

120
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.640
Punters even place bets
on field placings and bowling changes.

121
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.440
{\an8}And so. for a bookie to have information
gave them a huge advantage.

122
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.560
Information was power at that time.

123
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.400
[Bahal] There were bookmakers
giving us stories

124
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.039
about how in a particular match
the bets swung very suspiciously.

125
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.840
It would raise suspicions.
that somebody has inside information.

126
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.360
What is that inside information?

127
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.440
That set me thinking.

128
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.200
did the bookies
have power over the players?

129
00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.360
[all] Out!

130
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.680
In the '90s. cable television had come

131
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.120
and it brought Indian cricket
into every village in the country.

132
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.600
And so. the greatest dream
for any Indian boy of that generation

133
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.080
was to play for India.

134
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.440
There was a sudden hope

135
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.520
that even if you were from a small town.

136
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.840
you could become a hero.

137
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.200
A whole new generation of players
had come along.

138
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.800
These kids
who are coming from small towns.

139
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.640
So it was all very new to them.
and at that time.

140
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.040
there were no gatekeepers
for access to cricketers.

141
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.840
Indian cricket at that time
was filled with these people

142
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.120
who were seen everywhere around the team.

143
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.560
Strange people
are walking into the Indian dressing room

144
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.760
who wanted to shower favors on them.

145
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.080
You know. who are these people?

146
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.720
[Bahal] So I started
talking to a lot of ex-players.

147
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.480
But a lot of them
didn't want to speak on record.

148
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.400
But I always try and dig some more.
try and dig some more.

149
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.520
And finally. I found...

150
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.240
Manoj Prabhakar.

151
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.960
[commentator] <i>Well bowled! That's
the inswinger. the late movement in.</i>

152
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.480
[Ugra] Manoj Prabhakar.

153
00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.640
he was a seam-bowling
all-rounder for India.

154
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.280
Great competitor and a fighting cricketer.

155
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.280
But he was always seen
as a journeyman player.

156
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.480
A lot of people
called him the poor man's Kapil Dev.

157
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.280
He's not a good athlete.

158
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.120
{\an8}You know?

159
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.440
{\an8}He is a poor athlete.
and that is a very. very big point.

160
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.280
[Ugra] Prabhakar was always very fiery.
He had many chips on his shoulder.

161
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.560
[in Hindi] People are of the opinion
that your temper is very unpredictable.

162
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.080
and you have said
that using profanity is in my nature?

163
00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.120
[in Hindi] When you play with passion.

164
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.120
if you are not fired up.
you'll lose everything.

165
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.000
If I don't show aggression on the ground.

166
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.080
a player like me cannot perform.

167
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.120
[in English] I was scared to ask questions
because I thought he'll slam the phone.

168
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.400
[in Hindi] No one is supporting you.
inside or outside of the team.

169
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.880
What's the reason for that?
Were you on good terms with them or not?

170
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.960
No one was allowed to raise their voice.

171
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.880
Fear might be the big reason for it.

172
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.640
Because whoever has spoken up.
he's faced problems.

173
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.240
[Bahal. in English]
Manoj had just retired in '96

174
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.840
{\an8}because the World Cup
hadn't gone too well for him.

175
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.960
{\an8}And after that. he'd been dropped.

176
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.320
So. I called and asked him.
what did he know?

177
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.120
What would he be willing to share?

178
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.840
Manoj had a very gruff exterior.

179
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.040
He had
a very contemptuous dig at journalists.

180
00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.480
[in Hindi] You don't dare print the truth.
You don't have the guts.

181
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.080
[in English] So there was
a lot of that attitude in Manoj.

182
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.760
Manoj took a lot of convincing.
I remember meeting him several times.

183
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.600
But finally. he opened a lot.
he told me a lot of stories.

184
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.600
Then suddenly told me
that an Indian player

185
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.920
had approached him about throwing a match.

186
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.880
It was a revelation.

187
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.160
That was the first time
a former Indian cricket player

188
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.360
came on record saying this had happened.

189
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.000
There was no question
we would run the story.

190
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.920
It was something
we wanted to make a lot of noise with.

191
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.440
{\an8}So I wrote this in. uh. June of 1997.

192
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.240
"India's Worst Kept Secret"
which was the first time that anybody

193
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.840
even knew
that there was match-fixing in cricket.

194
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.040
And Manoj's famous allegation
really caught a cat on the hot tin roof.

195
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.160
[news intro music plays]

196
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.440
Manoj Prabhakar
recently created a sensation

197
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.960
by alleging that he'd been offered
a large sum of money to throw.

198
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.840
which means deliberately lose.

199
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.520
an international cricket match.

200
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.280
[Ugra] "I was offered rupees 25 lakh

201
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.360
for sabotaging the match
in Pakistan's favor."

202
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.560
"I was told to play
below my usual standard."

203
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.000
"I told him to get out of my room."

204
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.040
It was shocking. the scale of money.

205
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.040
And the fact that he'd been asked
by a fellow teammate to do it.

206
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.800
that was what was unsettling.

207
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.320
Sport is fundamentally
meant to be unscripted.

208
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.720
The unexpectedness of it
is what makes it special.

209
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.360
If it's scripted.

210
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.000
it takes away
everything that sport stands for.

211
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.200
And so we just got the feeling

212
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.200
something terrible was about to
break through in Indian cricket.

213
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.920
But I think a lot of people
didn't want to believe it.

214
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.480
[Karri] Cricket was suddenly
growing. growing. growing.

215
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.640
Match-fixing.

216
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.360
Suddenly that shadow. match-fixing.

217
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.840
It's like on a sunny day
you're playing a match.

218
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.520
suddenly clouds. thunder.
rains and the match stops.

219
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.000
Match-fixing allegations cast a doubt.

220
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.600
But I think. by and large.
nobody wanted to trust Manoj Prabhakar.

221
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.640
[camera shutters clicking]

222
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.680
[reporter] <i>As Prabhakar
refuses to name the player</i>

223
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.040
<i>who he claims
approached him to fix the match.</i>

224
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.280
<i>critics have wondered
if his allegations bear any substance.</i>

225
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.160
<i>His lawyer maintains that as Prabhakar
cannot prove his allegation.</i>

226
00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.400
<i>it is up to authorities to investigate.</i>

227
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.720
[Bahal] There was a lot of skepticism.

228
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.680
A lot of aggression towards us.

229
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.160
And the officials who ran the game

230
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.160
had an ostrich-like attitude
right from the beginning.

231
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.120
Here is a sport that you love so much.

232
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.920
Here is wrongdoing that you know about.
But nobody wanted to do anything.

233
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.440
[Ugra] Many in the cricket establishment

234
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.680
did not want to upset
this lovely little world.

235
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.920
"Everything is so comfortable.
we are so happy. money is coming."

236
00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.520
"This is nonsense.
Let it not rock the boat."

237
00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.440
That story was looked down on
and treated so shabbily.

238
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.640
It suddenly
just went into a pool of nothingness.

239
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.400
Manoj Prabhakar
was cast into the wilderness.

240
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.520
[Bahal] The cricket board was so unhappy

241
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.760
they went and sued us for five crores.

242
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.440
They wanted to put a lid on it.

243
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.600
[crowd cheering]

244
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.000
Cricket went on.
but the story was just dying to come out.

245
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.120
And when it actually happened.

246
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:37.320
the strange part about it
is that it happened by accident.

247
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.520
[line ringing]

248
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.520
In 2000. there was a gentleman
who made a complaint

249
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.280
{\an8}that he had been
receiving threatening calls

250
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.040
{\an8}and. uh. people were trying
to extort money from him.

251
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.319
[tape rewinding]

252
00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:20.200
We started to monitor the telephones.

253
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.839
We heard some kind of a dispute going on.

254
00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.440
Highly abusive language.

255
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.720
Not because of any extortion.

256
00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:33.119
they are discussing
something about cricket.

257
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.120
And then we heard. "Hi. Hansie."

258
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.600
"Hi. Hansie."

259
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.280
Who else could it be except Hansie Cronje?

260
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.120
[commentator] <i>And again. Well.
this is magnificent stuff from Cronje.</i>

261
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.320
[Ugra] Hansie Cronje was one of
the most admired cricketers in the world.

262
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.440
Picked for South African captaincy
very early in his career.

263
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.800
Recording for television?

264
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.000
Can I say hello to my mother?

265
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.520
[Ugra] Everybody loved Hansie.

266
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.640
He had the finest qualities.

267
00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.880
He was really a cult figure
in his own country.

268
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.840
Absolutely a pillar of the community.

269
00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.920
[Cronje speaking on phone]

270
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.920
[KK Paul] Hansie Cronje
was speaking to a bookie

271
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.320
discussing in detail
who is to score how many runs.

272
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.360
[man speaking on phone]

273
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.280
[Cronje speaking]

274
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.200
How much of money is to be paid?

275
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.720
[man speaking]

276
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.840
[Cronje speaking]

277
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.360
Here. there was solid evidence.

278
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.760
Hansie Cronje was. uh.
involved in match-fixing.

279
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.920
[Paul] It emerges

280
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.200
that the one-day international
cricket matches

281
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.880
between India and South Africa
played recently in India were fixed.

282
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.680
One of the conspirators was identified

283
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.280
as the South African cricket captain.
Hansie Cronje.

284
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.200
[Ugra] When the news first came.

285
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.760
your first chance to say.
"No. it's not true."

286
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.040
Of all the people
in the entire cricket world.

287
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.000
you would not pick on that name.

288
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.760
I've never received any sum of money
for any match that I've been involved in.

289
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.720
I've never approached any of the players.

290
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.760
First response from South Africa
was absolute denial.

291
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.680
The allegations are outrageous.

292
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.920
It's libelous. it's defamatory.

293
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.440
[Paul] Nobody would believe it.

294
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.720
So. whatever evidence we had.
we had to make it public.

295
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.160
And then Hansie Cronje felt the pressure

296
00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.480
and ultimately. then he confessed.

297
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.400
[reporter 1] <i>The cricket world
has been stunned</i>

298
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.680
<i>after a shocking admission
by Hansie Cronje.</i>

299
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.840
{\an8}[reporter 2] <i>Complete disbelief.
Impossible to say what will happen next.</i>

300
00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.040
[Bahal] When the Hansie incident broke.

301
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.200
there was a sense of.
"Finally nobody could deny it anymore"

302
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.240
that there was match-fixing in cricket.

303
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.200
The news environment became so hot.

304
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.600
Could Indian players be involved?

305
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.240
[Dev] This is have to be clean-up job.

306
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.640
If anybody in the world
have done something this bad.

307
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.160
should be hanged.

308
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.880
[Bahal] And I was getting very ambitious

309
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.320
about revisiting the match-fixing story.
so to speak.

310
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.080
So I started talking to other reporters
and that's when Minty came onboard.

311
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.960
[Tejpal] I'm insanely curious.
I've always been so.

312
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.440
I need to know the truth.
what I really love.

313
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.120
This was investigative journalism.

314
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.600
Hardcore investigative journalism
because you were chasing down a story.

315
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.720
So. in year 2000. Aniruddha Bahal.
fabulous writer and journalist and myself.

316
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.640
started this company called Tehelka.

317
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.640
It's an Urdu word which means "sensation.
impact. bloody hell. explosion."

318
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.840
And our slug line was
"News. Views. All the juice." My line.

319
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.840
[Bahal] We had the ambition
for cricket match-fixing

320
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.200
to be the first story
that we did in Tehelka.

321
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.200
But the cast of characters
who were part of it

322
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.480
were still not willing to talk about it.

323
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.280
Everybody went. "Mum's the word."

324
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.160
[Tejpal] I think the only way
to get certain truths out

325
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.800
is cloak and dagger.

326
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.480
So we came up
with this plan to target and trap

327
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.320
the cricketers and administrators

328
00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.360
using spy cam equipment
and get the truth out.

329
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.080
[Bahal] This would be
the first time hidden cameras

330
00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.200
would have been used
on a big scale in India.

331
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.560
So. I had to go to London

332
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.080
to get the most cutting-edge tech available.

333
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.280
So for example.
we can put it in these glasses.

334
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.320
[Tejpal] Camera fitted
in glasses. watches. pens...

335
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.280
Stuff never used in India before ever.
We had never seen it.

336
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.480
[Bahal] There was this briefcase
which had this whole big recording device.

337
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.680
So now if we had good quality spy cam...

338
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.440
we needed access to those players.

339
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.000
So. Manoj
was an obvious choice of an insider.

340
00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.680
Manoj realized. last three years.
nobody has found anything out.

341
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.400
Nothing came out. Nothing happened.

342
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.480
When I informed those guys.
why didn't they take the action?

343
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.120
For him to see cheating
in a sport that he loved.

344
00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.560
That's like seeing your wife
being unfaithful in front of your eyes.

345
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.640
This is not my job to solve the problem.

346
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640
This is their job.

347
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.680
He said. "How can I prove my innocence?
How can I prove this incident happened?"

348
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.680
Nobody was willing to stand up for him.

349
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.400
[Bahal] One of the ways
I could convince him was with the tech.

350
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.920
So. I went back to Manoj.

351
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.760
I told him. if you go undercover.

352
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.920
perhaps more will come out
and validate your claims.

353
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.240
Then while we were talking about it.
I filmed it and he didn't know about it.

354
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.800
Manoj was stunned. Okay?
He's saying. "What the hell?"

355
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.480
His eyes lit up.
"Really? I can do this?"

356
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.480
Manoj realized that the hidden camera

357
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.560
was the only way
to put the cat on the hot tin roof again.

358
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.000
[Tejpal] Over a period of six weeks.

359
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.400
Manoj Prabhakar and Aniruddha Bahal
traversed the country

360
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.560
to sting various cricketers
and administrators

361
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.960
who were not match-fixing themselves.

362
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.200
but they knew about it.
knew it was happening.

363
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.200
Aniruddha Bahal
is a fearless investigative journalist.

364
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.000
But Manoj Prabhakar

365
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.760
was going out and stinging
his friends and colleagues.

366
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.200
Guys he had played with for so many years.

367
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.360
You need balls
to run with this kind of thing.

368
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.360
[Bahal] It was the first time
I went undercover.

369
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.520
The fear that you could be caught out

370
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.440
is always there.

371
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.200
See. you're not getting opportunities
for controlling angles.

372
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.400
Because that would look very suspicious.

373
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.920
And you're perhaps getting
just the legs of the chair. so to speak.

374
00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.440
or the heads are cut.

375
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.440
You had to also be worried about...

376
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.120
Has the battery run out?
Or has the tape run out?

377
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.560
You would have to take a bathroom break
to change the tape or battery.

378
00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.080
And going in the loo
with a briefcase looks suspicious.

379
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.240
"Why is he..." [laughs]

380
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.360
We would bring in the tapes in.
Manoj Prabhakar and me. and then...

381
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.600
Minty's job
was to produce the whole thing.

382
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.120
[Tejpal] The first day
when the material came back

383
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.320
and we started looking at the footage.

384
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.560
I realized it's going to be
a fucking nightmare to do.

385
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.480
[indistinct voices on tape]

386
00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.360
Very scratchy audio. strange video angles.

387
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.120
You try and transcribe an interview
where you can't see lip movement. girl.

388
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.800
It is maddening.

389
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.480
But even though none of them were involved
in any wrongdoing themselves.

390
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.800
it very quickly became clear.
we had an explosive story on our hands.

391
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.600
[man 1 speaking on tape]

392
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.880
[Tejpal] These people were saying
what they suspected was happening.

393
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.520
[man 1 speaking on tape]

394
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.680
[Tejpal] We were watching
the top cricketers and administrators

395
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.160
talking about match-fixing
in such casual manner.

396
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.600
[man 2 speaking Hindi on tape]

397
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.400
[Bahal. in English]
The Hansie incident created furore.

398
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.360
Then the news environment became so hot...

399
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.720
We had this. sort of. big fear in us.

400
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.440
If we didn't break the story.
some leak will happen somewhere.

401
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.560
There was a lot of time pressure on me.

402
00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.520
But Minty was this production guy

403
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.080
who wanted to take things
one step at a time.

404
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.120
We had shot people on the sly.

405
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.240
We had stung them.

406
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.160
I could not have one word going wrong.

407
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.960
[man 3 on tape]

408
00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.760
Manoj. at one point.
called me every four. five days...

409
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.040
[in Hindi] "Is the edit ready?
Is the film done?"

410
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.040
[in English] Fuck you! This is not bloody.
some bloody Maggi noodles happening. man.

411
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.520
This is serious stuff.

412
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:41.600
and I'm a slightly serious
and scary motherfucker when I need to be.

413
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.240
[reporter] <i>An explosive film
about corruption in Indian cricket</i>

<i>that could throw the game into chaos
is said to be released today.</i>

415
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.200
Hall was filled with some 40 cameras
and 100 journalists.

416
00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.640
Packed to the rafters.

417
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.360
International media. politicians. lawyers...

418
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.440
The word had spread.

419
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.880
[camera shutters clicking]

420
00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.160
[Bahal] The cast of characters
was the who's who in cricket.

421
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.960
There was obviously enormous interest.

422
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.040
[Tejpal] We had sent
a copy of the tape to the president.

423
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.080
Because we were very worried
that our tapes might get confiscated.

424
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.040
and we didn't know
if action would be taken.

425
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.920
And then. at two o'clock.

426
00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:35.600
the final <i>Fallen Heroes</i> documentary
was eventually shown to the press.

427
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.640
[dramatic music playing]

428
00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.160
[dramatic music continues over laptop]

429
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.840
When the tapes first emerged.
everyone was aghast.

430
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.480
[man 1 on tape]

431
00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.040
I think it broke a lot of people's hearts
to see what was happening.

432
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.760
I was horrified to hear
officials say cricket's finished.

433
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.200
Everyone's going to leave it.

434
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.040
[man 1 speaking Hindi on tape]

435
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.400
[Tejpal. in English] Our press conference
was stunned.

436
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.920
It revealed quite clearly
that match-fixing was happening in India.

437
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.400
and the cricketers and administrators.
they knew it was happening.

438
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.960
[man 2 speaking Hindi on tape]

439
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.400
[in English] That creates... boom!

440
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.920
[Ugra] The cricket fans
were deeply shattered.

441
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.600
You did think that cricket
was having a credibility crisis.

442
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.560
[reporter] <i>Unsurprisingly.
some of the team's key figures</i>

444
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.960
I think. uh... Nobody told me anything.

445
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.360
I'm not aware of those things.
That's all I have to say.

<i>Thank you very much.</i>

451
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.120
[Tejpal] Manoj was very. very happy
that we stuck with him.

452
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.320
We finished the story.

453
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.000
And finally. he told us
the biggest bit of explosive news.

454
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.680
the name of the cricketer
who offered him the bribe.

455

<i>I first met Manoj in mid '97.</i>

<i>when I went to him
to have a chat about match-fixing.</i>

457
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.760
Even in those early days.
he would drop sufficient hints

458
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.200
that the name
he was referring to was Kapil Dev.

459
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.640
[commentator] <i>That's out. Yes.</i>

460
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.240
Growing up. Kapil Dev was our hero.

461
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:41.120
In 1983. when India won the World Cup.
he became a superstar across India.

[reporter 1] <i>Prabhakar has finally
come forward to name Kapil Dev.</i>

463
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.600
[Ugra] So when Manoj Prabhakar
took Kapil Dev's name.

464
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.600
it's almost like
challenging a God of cricket.

465
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:56.200
Oh. who's Prabhakar? Ready to face?
Does he have a guts to face me?

466
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.000
[in Hindi] What does Prabhakar
think of himself?

467
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.760
What is he even worth?
What cricket has he played?

468
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.200
What good has he done?

469
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.520
I have no regrets.

470
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.240
But my aim
has always been to clean cricket.

471
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.880
to clean the system.

472
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.800
Today. by doing this.

473
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.160

when all these revelations came out.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.480
But the kind of allegations that
were being made at that point of time.

501
00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.720
they were absolutely unbelievable.

502
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:06.360
How could we think anybody throwing a game
which he was playing for the nation?

503
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.680
So I just grabbed at it.
I said. "Why not. sir?"

504
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.560
"It would be an honor. Absolutely."

505
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.280
[reporters clamoring]

506
00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.320
The CBI investigation was a massive story.
It made for absolutely compelling viewing.

507
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.680
Here at the CBI headquarters.
there's almost a veil of secrecy.

508
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.240
Cricketers and alleged bookies
will be interrogated in the coming weeks.

509
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.440
[indistinct clamoring]

510
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.160
[Sawani] The eyes of the entire nation
were fixed on the CBI.

511
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.080
What happened? What is the truth?

512
00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:50.680
As a muckraker. you have to get into areas
which you think are going to be tough.

513
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.840
No-go areas.

514
00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.000
Even though
this is a very high-profile case

515
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.520
where reputations
are going to be made or marred.

516
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.280
I managed to sort of. uh. worm my way

517
00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.520
with some of the key people
involved in this investigation.

518
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:15.040
The CBI's expertise
has largely been uncovering corruption

519
00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.280
in various other facets.
but not in cricket.

520
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:24.400
I don't think they really had an inkling
on how big the case would turn out to be.

521
00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.960
[Sawani] Frankly.
when we started this investigation.

522
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.199
there was only this one allegation
made by Manoj Prabhakar

523
00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:40.760
that Kapil Dev offered him 25 lakh rupees.

524
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.239
People did want to know.

525
00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:45.000
is there any truth
in what Manoj Prabhakar is saying?

526
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.880
[Bahal] We knew the CBI
would be interested in what we had done.

527
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.320
The next thing we knew.
the CBI wanted all our material.

528
00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.280
[reporter] <i>Prabhakar seems sure
that after watching his tape.</i>

<i>against some Indian players.</i>

531

[in Hindi] If you speak with them.
you will understand.

532
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.960
I have proven who it was
that offered me the bribe.

533
00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.360
[man on laptop. in English]
<i>Azhar was officially... Yes!</i>

534
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.840
[Sawani] We did glean all the information
that was there in those tapes.

535
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.880
{\an8}[man speaking Hindi on tape]

537
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.280
[Sawani] There were
a lot of allegations flying around.

538
00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.480
but I wouldn't say

539
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.440
that there was any major evidence
which could nail somebody without doubt.

540
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.680
[Krishnan] The problem with
sting operations using hidden cameras is.

541
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.760
it was mostly anecdotal evidence.

542
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.720
There was no empirical material evidence.

543
00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.520
But RN Sawani was a very smart officer.

544
00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.280
He was keen on
looking at the bigger picture.

547
00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.320
[Sawani] Tehelka tapes
did expose the underbelly

548
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.880
in the world of cricket

549
00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.480

[man speaking Hindi on tape]

551
00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.120
[in English] The CBI had to find out
whether players were tainted

552
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.080
and what kind of nexus
they did enjoy with bookmakers.

553

[reporters clamoring]

554
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.840
[Sawani] My team started to gather

who had ever been booked
by any police station in the country.

556
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:51.240
This spread to Mumbai. Delhi.
Gujarat region. Rajasthan.

557
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.080
Within the first week.

558
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.360
we had 209 top bookies
of the country in our list.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.600
[bookie on tape. in Hindi]
<i>When the CBI agent got involved.</i>

560
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.560

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.720

562
00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:15.720

564

565
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.600

was to get deeper into this case.</i>

566
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.240

<i>84. 58-59...</i>

569
00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.600
[in English] We found that there was
a system called a "dabba system."

<i>We don't want to know
who gives these rates.</i>

581
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.520
[Ugra. in English] Every bookie was
dealing with somebody at a higher level.

582
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.880
And it is almost like a ladder at which
it goes to the person right at the top

583
00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.680
who makes all the big money there is.

584
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.400
[Sawani] As we dug further
into this investigation.

585
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.640
it became bigger and bigger and bigger.

586
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.600
We found out the bookies
were being controlled by criminals...

587
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.880
in Dubai and Sharjah.

588
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.320
Sharjah was this Las Vegas
of the Middle East.

[crowd cheering]

590
00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.320

they will go to Sharjah to watch a match.

592
00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.400
movie stars.

593

their sunglasses and fashion and all that.

594
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.240
And amidst them all
would be sitting a man.

595
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.560
India's most wanted criminal.
Dawood Ibrahim.

596
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.480
He was known for controlling drugs.

597
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.800
He would kill anybody
who wouldn't give him regular money.

598
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.880
He would be sitting there
talking on a telephone

599
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.600
and obviously giving orders
on what should happen in the game.

600
00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.040
And therefore.
those who were in cricket in those days

601
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.080
had to suffer
a lot of underworld pressure.

602
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.200
[siren wailing]

603
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.480
[Sawani] You must understand.

604
00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.680
this bookie world is a dangerous world.

605
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.520
The crime syndicates
are unforgiving to any who break the line.

606
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.920
So nobody
wanted to come out and say anything

607
00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.880
about what's wrong with the game.

608
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.200
But then a very. very important
breakthrough came from South Africa.

609
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.640
[reporter 1] <i>Cronje is to be
cross-examined at the King Commission</i>

610
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.560
<i>as part of the latest development

611
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.320
[reporter 2] <i>The aim of the commission
is to get to the truth of the allegations.</i>

612
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.400
At the same time as the CBI investigation.
South Africans set up the King Commission

613
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.880
to look into Hansie Cronje's confession.

614
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.480
I failed in my moral
and professional duties.

615
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.840
I was not honest
and I apologize unreservedly.

616
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.040
His whole persona had changed.

617
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.640
He literally shrunk down in his chair.

618
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.640
But the most dramatic thing
in the King Commission

619
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.400
was when Hansie Cronje revealed

620
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:14.480
the Indian connection
with a global network of illegal betting.

621
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:20.840
Cronje said that he had been introduced
to this bookie. M.K Gupta.

622
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.920
[Cronje] He asked me
to speak to the other players

623
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.560
and gave me approximately
30.000 US dollars in cash to do so.

624
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.720
That was a big revelation.

625
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.560
We realized
he would be a gold mine for us.

626
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.280
But M.K was not in our list of bookies.

627
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.120
So. we started a big hunt.

628
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.040
[reporter] <i>The CBI hunt
for bookie M.K Gupta</i>

629
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.720
<i>started today
in Delhi's South Extension market.</i>

630
00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.840
Who was M.K Gupta?

631
00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.760
No one knew what he looked like.

632
00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.760
Now. would he have bodyguards?
Would he have bouncers with him?

633
00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.800
[Sawani] We went to his house.
we searched his house.

634
00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.640
We went to his relatives' places.

635
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.880
We found that he had a jewelry shop.

636
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.200
which was being manned by his father.

637
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.160
[Krishnan] I found out from his neighbors.

638
00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.120
he did not mingle with people.
he kept to himself.

639
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.160
Obviously. I thought he had to do that.

640
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.240
given the line of business he was in.

641
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.920
[Sawani] The moment this news came on TV.

642
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.120
he went underground
and was nowhere to be found.

643
00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.320
But somewhere.
he learnt that the CBI is really after him

644
00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.160
and that
they would do anything to get at him.

645
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.240
and the pressure was on him
all the time to come out.

646
00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.000
[Neeraj Kumar] I have always been
a cricket fan from my childhood.

647
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.320
{\an8}I put great cricketers

648
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.360
{\an8}who would serve the country
on a high pedestal.

649
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.840
But in 2000. an informant came up to me

650
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.600
and said that
someone wanted to surrender before me.

651
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.880
A guy called M.K Gupta.

652
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.600
I said. "Why me?"

653
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.160
Because I was not
inquiring into the matter.

654
00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.760
So he said.
"Sir. he has seen you in a public meeting

655
00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.000
and somehow he feels that if he meets you.

656
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.680
you can guide him."

657
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.640
I felt important. I am like...
I am the chosen one.

658
00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.800
[laughs]

659
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.520
We decided to meet
in a super deluxe hotel.

660
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.920
I was very sure of the informant.

661
00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.840
So. I went without any backup.

662
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.960
[doorbell rings]

663
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.360
And a very ordinary-looking person
opened the door.

664
00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.280
[in Hindi] Yes. sir.

665
00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.880
[in English] Please come in.

666
00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.760
Then I suddenly see
two more people in the room.

667
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.400
Then I became a little anxious.

668
00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.920
So I took a long breath.

669
00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.680
And I said. "Why do you want to meet me?"

670
00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.520
He says...

671
00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.600
[in Hindi] "Sir. I am to blame
for this entire fiasco."

672
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.800
[in English] "I am at the root
of all the problems."

673
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.760
And as he began to talk.

674
00:44:54.200 --> 00:45:00.640
I realized that my tryst
with corruption in cricket had commenced.

675
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.840
He was telling me such secrets.

676
00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.840
I decided to take him back
to the CBI headquarters.

677
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.400
[Sawani] When we brought Mukesh Gupta
into the CBI.

678
00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.840
he was certainly scared.

679
00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.920
If he was to reveal the names of anybody.

680
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.160
his life was in danger. definitely.

681
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.360
But we assured Mukesh Gupta.

682
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.120
"No harm will come to you
once you tell us the truth."

683
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.840
And finally.
he was willing to tell us his story.

684
00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.520
Mukesh Gupta was a graduate
from one of the Delhi colleges.

685
00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.160
He was initially employed with a bank.

686
00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.200
[Kumar] When he would walk home.

687
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.880
at the road corner.
he would watch people betting on cricket.

688
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.880
He had never played cricket himself.

689
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.760
but in double-quick time.

690
00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:21.080
he understood
all the finer points of the game.

691
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.200
[Sawani] At that point of time.
he would also go and watch

692
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.520
kids playing cricket in the local grounds.

693
00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.520
[Kumar] He understood
that if you spot somebody with talent.

694
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.000
you can groom a youngster.

695
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.560
And that was when he met Ajay Sharma.

696
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.720
[Ugra] Ajay Sharma was a boy
from not a very wealthy family

697
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:52.760
playing in Delhi.

698
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.560
He plays a great innings.
he scores a hundred.

699
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.320
someone puts hundred bucks in his pocket
and says. "I'm so happy. I'm a fan."

700
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.920
[Sawani] At the time.
he didn't realize what was happening

701
00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.000
and he felt elated
that somebody was appreciating his game.

702
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.360
But bookies think long period.

703
00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.200
They will cultivate a player
for years and years

704
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.760
before they come up
with their first request.

705
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:26.320
[bookie on tape. in Hindi] <i>We meet them
as any normal person would.</i>

706
00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.720
<i>We don't tell them we are bookies.</i>

707
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.640
<i>You get to know their weaknesses.</i>

708
00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.720
[in English] <i>Gifts. parties. women...</i>

709
00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.520
[in Hindi] <i>Alcohol is very useful.</i>

710
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.600
<i>Once you have befriended them.</i>

711
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.600
<i>they are willing to talk.</i>

712
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.920
<i>Then you strike a deal.</i>

713
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.880
[Kumar. in English] And Ajay Sharma
rose to be a national cricketer.

714
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:57.920
And M.K Gupta
got so much inside information.

715
00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.880
he made lots and lots of money.

716
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.280
And he shared that money with Ajay Sharma.

717
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.160
[Sawani] Once you're in.

718
00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.720
you know. it's like the insects
who get into the wood-borer.

719
00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.840
Then you are caught for life.

720
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.320
Mukesh Gupta would say.
"You've told me this. I paid you this."

721
00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.280
Perhaps he would even
be recording the conversation.

722
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.600
He would be able to blackmail the player.

723
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.280
And it is Ajay Sharma
who introduced Mukesh Gupta

724
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.920
to no other person
than the captain himself...

725
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.280
Mohammed Azharuddin.

726
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.760
[commentator] <i>That's straight
down the ground. It's in the air...</i>

727
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.960
Azharuddin.

728
00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:46.880
Azharuddin.

729
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.680
- Azharuddin.
- Mohammed Azharuddin.

730
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.040
[audience cheering]

731
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.280
[Sawani] That was a big revelation.

732
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.520
It was really. really at the top
at that point of time.

733
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.400
The icon for the country.

734
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.960
And any allegation against him

735
00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.880
could not be palatable
to the Indian public.

736
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.120
Could Mukesh Gupta
bribe somebody like Mohammed Azharuddin?

737
00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.880
I felt the pressure
to find out what is the truth.

738
00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.120
- [man in Hindi] Does the color look right?
- It's fabulous.

739
00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.080
[woman] The color is lovely.
but it's not jittering. right?

740
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.240
It's a summer color.

741
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.080
Had I worn a dark one.
it'd have been awful in this heat.

742
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.720
[in English] Azhar was never
a communicative person.

743
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.760
He's not somebody who can really
tell you what he's thinking or feeling.

744
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.400
- This shirt is nice. right?
- Very nice.

745
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.080
I didn't wear a dark-colored shirt...

746
00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.240
[in Hindi] But I hope it's not jittering.

747
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.640
[in English] Reticent. reluctant.
very nervous.

748
00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.440
When was the last time you cried?

749
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.880
- Uh. cried?
- Yeah.

750
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
- I don't think I cry.
- You don't cry?

751
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.120
I hardly cry.

752
00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.280
All that would disappear
when he stepped on the ground.

753
00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.880
- [commentator] <i>Lovely shot.</i>
- [crowd cheering]

754
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.560
What timing. what grace. what beauty.

755
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.680
[commentator] <i>And again...</i>

756
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.040
And then these wrists...

757
00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.800
It was like a slap
on the ego of the bowler.

758
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.360
{\an8}[commentator] <i>Azharuddin
is only dealing in fours.</i>

759
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.840
{\an8}As if God made Azhar's wrists
on a very leisurely afternoon.

760
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.600
carving them to perfection.

761
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:25.960
[clicks tongue]

762
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:31.400
{\an8}[commentator] <i>There it is.
a thoroughly deserved century</i>

763
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.760
{\an8}<i>for Mohammed Azharuddin.</i>

764
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.600
[Karri] I remember
when he made a century on his debut.

765
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.280
then a second test and a second century.

766
00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.880
And then a third century.

767
00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:46.480
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

768
00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.880
He's a hero for the entire nation.

769
00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:01.000
I was. uh. 14 when Azhar came back
after creating the world record.

770
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.400
It was huge. It was massive.

771
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.640
The whole Hyderabad was there.
greeting him.

772
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:12.120
You are ours now.
You're the son of Hyderabad.

773
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.600
I told myself. one day.

774
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.920
it will be me also on that podium.

775
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:28.280
[Sawani] Mohammed Azharuddin is somebody
who brought laurels to the country.

776
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.480
Why are you filming? I'm telling you no.

777
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.080
[in Hindi] Now go blow it up
on the television.

778
00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.120
[in English] But as we dug
further into this investigation.

779
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:46.160
we found there were. you know.
some things to be looked into.

780
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.800
[in Hindi] There is no need to film.
Why are you still filming it?

781
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.080
[Tejpal. in English] During
the <i>Fallen Heroes</i> investigation.

782
00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.040
Azhar's name keeps cropping up.

783
00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.840
[man 1 speaking Hindi on tape]

784
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:09.400
[in English] A lot of stories
was about Azhar's making a quick deal

785
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.360
of 10 lakhs here. 20 lakhs here.

786
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.400
taking a watch from here.
buying a Mercedes.

787
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.400
Those kind of deals. too many of them.

788
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.840
[man 2 speaking Hindi on tape]

789
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.080
[man 3 in Punjabi]

790
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.400
[in English] Other players. they felt
he had more money than he should.

791
00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.760
[Sawani] He had cultivated
expensive habits.

792
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.720
Yeah. you are also a very stylish man.
I've already seen... very nice shoes.

793
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.520
- Louis Vuitton. Armani...
- Louis Vuitton. Armani?

794
00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.960
- And the watch?
- Piaget.

795
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.840
[Sawani] He wanted very fancy watches.

796
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.600
He was going around in Mumbai

797
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.560
in high circles.

798
00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.400
So. uh. obviously. all that needed money.

799
00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.160
[Kumar] M.K told me
that he could trap Azhar

800
00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.000
with relative amount of ease

801
00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:10.480
because by then.
Azhar's lifestyle had become such

802
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.720
that he needed lots of money.

803
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.840
[Sawani] Azhar mentioned to Ajay Sharma

804
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.360
that he was in need of some money

805
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:27.080
because his girlfriend
was doing some fashion show.

806
00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.080
His requirement was around.
I think. one crore of rupees.

807
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.800
which was a huge.
huge amount at that point of time.

808
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.960
Ajay Sharma threw the bait.

809
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.880
"There is a person
who could give you that sort of money."

810
00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:52.440
There was a meeting organized
in Taj Palace Hotel in Delhi

811
00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.000
with Azharuddin and Mukesh Gupta.

812
00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.720
Mukesh Gupta. being the clever guy he was.

813
00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:03.160
offered to pay 50 lakh rupees
on that same day.

814
00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.040
and give him
the rest of the money a little later.

815
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:12.360
But it was kind of obviously clear
M.K expected a lot from Azhar.

816
00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.240
[bookie. in Hindi] <i>To a bookie.</i>

817
00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:20.200
<i>the captain is more important
than any other player.</i>

818
00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.040
<i>Because a captain
has the most information.</i>

819
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:28.080
<i>If a bookie has a captain on his side.
he makes the most money.</i>

820
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.160
[Sawani. in English] As a captain.
Azharuddin was able to bring in

821
00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:36.480
other team members to do his bidding.

822
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.400
Get players to underperform
and therefore lose the match.

823
00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.240
All these cricketers'.
you know. claim to fame

824
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.920
is that they're playing for India.
What an honor!

825
00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.960
And selling that honor? Shameful.

826
00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.880
It definitely needed
to be met with an iron hand.

827
00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:12.400
[Kumar] M.K's revelations
were the backbone of the CBI inquiry.

828
00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.840
They recorded his statement

829
00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.840
and they found supporting evidence.

830
00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:26.840
[Sawani] We picked up all the call records
of Mohammed Azharuddin

831
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.360
and they showed he had been talking
to a number of bookies.

832
00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.080
Even talking to an underworld don.

833
00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.400
Mukesh Gupta told us

834
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:44.200
Mohammed Azharuddin was running
a locker in the Taj Palace Hotel

835
00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:48.680
where people would come and deposit money.

836
00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:53.360
And this was corroborated by.
you know. interviewing the hotel staff.

837
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.560
{\an8}He went shopping
at the famous Harrods in England.

838
00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:05.440
All his bills were paid
by somebody other than himself.

839
00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.400
We. of course.
found out it was one of the bookies.

840
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:17.680
After collecting all this evidence.
we were ready to call in Azharuddin.

841
00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.920
I had sat through the previous night

842
00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:25.440
strategizing on. you know.
the sequence of questioning.

843
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:30.000
There was a little bit
of. you know. anxiety there

844
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.800
that let's not do anything wrong.

845
00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.160
The captain of the team.
he needs to be clean

846
00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:42.400
and if he is not.
then he needs to be brought to book.

847
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.320
[reporters clamoring]

848
00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.480
[Kumar] When Mohammed Azharuddin
came to the CBI headquarters.

849
00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.040
all hell broke loose.

850
00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:00.000
[Krishnan] I clearly remember
television crews. hordes of reporters.

851
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:04.240
Could Azhar be involved
in corrupting the game?

852
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.720
Can't be. Azhar? No chance.

853
00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.240
That was the only thing
which came into my mind.

854
00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.840
[in Hindi] They are trying
to finish his career.

855
00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.320
They want to shut him down.

856
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.640
[Sawani. in English] We have
specific investigation rooms

857
00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.280
where you do interrogations.

858
00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.560
All questioning would be across the table.

859
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.320
Most of the players
who came into the CBI headquarters

860
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.000
had a scare on their face.

861
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:47.160
But there were a category of players
who knew what they were doing.

862
00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.520
I would put Mohammed Azharuddin
in that category.

863
00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.320
Azharuddin never answers
a question straight.

864
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.280
Very rarely
would he want to open his mouth.

865
00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.200
Perhaps he had been advised.
less you speak. the better.

866
00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:10.480
Mohammed Azharuddin
actually stonewalled all queries.

867
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:16.800
So. the CBI officials
decided they must change tack.

868
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.320
[Sawani] That's when we confronted him
with the evidence we had.

869
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.760
We started listing his properties.

870
00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.640
fancy cars. watches.

871
00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.080
We showed him his call records.

872
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.200
Even the SIM that was being used by him

873
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.480
was provided by one of the bookies.

874
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:43.400
{\an8}The threat was there
that we have M.K sitting in the next room.

875
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.200
If you are denying this.
should we bring him in?

876
00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.000
[Krishnan] That was the turning point.

877
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
I think he broke down after that.

878
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.280
[Sawani] And finally. he told us...

879
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.840
[in Hindi] "Yes. I fixed this match."

880
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.280
[in English] He was a broken man.

881
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.320
But I can't have any sympathy for a player
who is tainted with match-fixing.

882
00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:18.800
Letting down his nation.

883
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.000
Definitely no.

884
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:34.920
People connect
with the game of cricket personally.

885
00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:42.360
They would cry. They would laugh.
They are so passionate about this game.

886
00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.960
So. once we found

887
00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.240
that there was
something wrong with this guy

888
00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.840
who was their icon.

889
00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.640
they had every right to know.

890
00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.040
[reporter 1] <i>In Delhi today.
the minister for sport</i>

891
01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.360
<i>unveiled the 75-page
CBI report into match-fixing.</i>

892
01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.440
[reporter 2] <i>The report shatters
cricket's long-held reputation</i>

893
01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.720
<i>for being a gentlemen's game.</i>

894
01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.480
{\an8}[Sawani] The CBI came to a conclusion
that match-fixing was rampant.

895
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.120
[woman] <i>There should be
a very real punishment.</i>

896
01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.400
<i>I can say
it's a heinous crime in my opinion.</i>

897
01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.240
{\an8}[Sawani] Besides naming our own.

898
01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:32.280
{\an8}he had named nine international players.

899
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.000
[reporters clamoring]

900
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.680
We also came to the conclusion
that little was being done

901
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.480
by the administrators to investigate.

902
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.680
[reporters clamoring]

903
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.600
Immediate impact was a big.
big bang in the world of cricket.

904
01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.000
When you hear that sport
which you love and you care about

905
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.840
and you're emotionally invested in.

906
01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.240
that this is happening.
you get really angry.

907
01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.880
You just get so pissed off.

908
01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.760
[indistinct shouting]

909
01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.480
How dare they?

910
01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.440
What kind of people do this?

911
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.400
But then you realize
you're part of a whole community

912
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.320
so busy worshipping them that
they can't even see what they're doing.

913
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.800
[crowd shouting in Hindi] Shut it!

914
01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.720
Whoever messes with us won't be spared.

915
01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.200
[Tejpal. in English] The only truth
about sport that fans care about

916
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.080
is that it has to be clean.

917
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.200
That competition is real.
It's not fake. it's not a setup.

918
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.640
But the players broke that bone.

919
01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.680
That's dangerous.

920
01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.640
[in Hindi] Whoever messes with us
won't be spared.

921
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.720
[in English] We wanted to look at.

922
01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.040
can we register
a criminal case against anybody?

923
01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:14.320
So we took an opinion
from three retired Supreme Court judges.

924
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.600
Although betting is illegal in India.

925
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.560
unfortunately.
match-fixing is not a criminal offense

926
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.840
and so I was personally dissatisfied

927
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.080
that we couldn't take
criminal action against these guys.

928
01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.200
[Ugra] I know many
who stopped watching cricket after that.

929
01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.520
They just gave up. Didn't care.

930
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.680
So. the only way for Indian cricket
to return to its equilibrium

931
01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.120
was for the cricket board to take action
against cricketers that were involved.

932
01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.960
[reporter] <i>The board is expected
to deal severely</i>

933
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.440
<i>with those implicated by the CBI report.</i>

934
01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.840
Cricketing world had to say to its fans.

935
01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.920
"No. no. no.
We'll not brook any nonsense."

936
01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.560
"We will nip it in the bud."

937
01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:09.720
That was one of the reasons
Azhar had to be made an example out of.

938
01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.680
He had to be hanged publicly

939
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.440
to reassure everybody
that the cricketing story is fine

940
01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.120
and Azhar was an aberration.

941
01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:22.600
[reporter] <i>In the case
of former captain Mohammed Azharuddin.</i>

942
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.920
<i>the finding is that he had a nexus
with bookies like M.K Gupta</i>

943
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.640
<i>and that he was involved in match-fixing.</i>

944
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.280
{\an8}Mohammed Azharuddin

945
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.640
{\an8}is debarred
from playing any cricket matches

946
01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:38.280
conducted or authorized
by ICC. BCCI for life.

947
01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.840
That's the saddest moment
for Indian cricket.

948
01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.520
Saddest moment for Indian cricket.

949
01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:00.120
Azhar was like.
"The person. the cricketer."

950
01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.240
So playing under him was something great.

951
01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.480
He lived by example. led by example.

952
01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.800
He is a fighter. He didn't wanted to lose.

953
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.600
So. I never believed it.

954
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.720
I never believed it
because Azhar couldn't do that.

955
01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.560
[Krishnan] Azhar was holed up
in Hyderabad.

956
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.360
He went into hiding.

957
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.400
He was drawn into a shell.

958
01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.840
I was the only journalist
that Azharuddin spoke to.

959
01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:57.360
That drive to Banjara
was. uh. definitely nervous.

960
01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.440
This is my first occasion meeting the man.

961
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.800
Would he be hostile?

962
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.200
Would he develop cold feet?

963
01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.040
Those thoughts were playing on my mind.

964
01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.760
He asked me for lunch.

965
01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.600
He gave me chicken biryani.

966
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:20.320
And after which. uh.
we sat down for the interview.

967
01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:30.400
He said that it would be grossly unfair
to put the blame on him squarely.

968
01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.400
He thought
that the problem was even bigger.

969
01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.280
But the larger point
he was trying to send out.

970
01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:45.280
he kept protesting loudly
that he was not involved.

971
01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.360
that he was being made a scapegoat.

972
01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.520
He kept telling me
that he would ride the storm...

973
01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.120
{\an8}and he would come out triumphant.

974
01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.040
{\an8}He actually thought

975
01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.920
the ban would be lifted
if he successfully contested it.

976
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.680
[Ramakanth Reddy] Being a lawyer
is my passion. my love.

977
01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.080
I've been practicing law
for the last 30 years.

978
01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.960
Now. after the life ban was imposed.

979
01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.800
Azhar came to me and said.

980
01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.280
[in Hindi] "Do something about it."

981
01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.640
[in English] We have a CBI report
which I read. reread and went on reading.

982
01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.240
Right from the beginning.
everything was not in order.

983
01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:53.080
See. the whole enquiry
is based on hearsay.

984
01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.560
What Ajay Sharma says.
or what. uh. Manoj Prabhakar says.

985
01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.480
Or Mukesh Kumar Gupta.

986
01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:07.800
He had lot of endorsements
and lakhs of rupees coming in.

987
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.080
He never had any assets

988
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.560
disproportionate
to the known sources of income.

989
01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.280
So how can we give credence
to this whole report?

990
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:22.520
There is not a single photograph.
not a single video clipping. nothing.

991
01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.680
It's very bad.

992
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.680
You are saying
that you never did anything wrong.

993
01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.080
It's complete rubbish.
the match-fixing allegations.

994
01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.600
- I think so.
- But they said

995
01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.120
you admitted
to some of the match-fixing stuff and...

996
01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.280
No. Because I have
no chargesheet from any agency.

997
01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.760
- So unless--
- But nor has your name been cleared.

998
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.160
Hopefully. it will be cleared.

999
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.360
Azharuddin completely denied
that he'd ever told the CBI

1000
01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.600
anything that was stated
in the CBI report.

1001
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.400
But after we spoke to him.

1002
01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:02.000
the income tax authorities had raided
his wife Sangeeta's house in Mumbai.

1003
01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.040
They had found a fax from Azharuddin.

1004
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:16.240
Surprisingly. he went home
and wrote everything that he had told us

1005
01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.360
and faxed them to his wife.
Sangeeta Bijlani.

1006
01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.600
Point-by-point.

1007
01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.359
he listed all the various things
that he had told us.

1008
01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:33.279
For example.
the introduction to M.K by Ajay Sharma.

1009
01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:39.080
He had also written in the fax
about his shopping spree in Harrods.

1010
01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.720
That bill had been paid
by one of the bookies.

1011
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.359
So that corroborated that. you know.

1012
01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:48.279
Azharuddin indeed
had told all that things to us.

1013
01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:51.040
He has been consistent all throughout

1014
01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.279
in saying
that he was not involved in match-fixing.

1015
01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:59.800
and any confession before a police officer
is essentially under pressure.

1016
01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.640
We were quite certain
that he was involved.

1017
01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.600
Left no room for any doubt.

1018
01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.680
[interviewer] These allegations came
and just ended your career abruptly.

1019
01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.920
How did you cope with that?
What did you do?

1020
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:19.680
Infinite patience.
That's the only thing you can have.

1021
01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:22.560
I mean. if anybody
possesses that. infinite patience.

1022
01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.880
I think they'll always
come out successful.

1023
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.399
- Thank you for being on the couch with me.
- My pleasure.

1024
01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.880
Although not answering
all the questions that honestly.

1025
01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.800
Maybe next time.

1026
01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:34.399
- We should have another couch with you.
- Maybe next time...

1027
01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:46.920
[Ugra] Once Mohammed Azharuddin
was banned.

1028
01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:50.080
there was a kind of a... "Let's move on.
Let's move ahead from here."

1029
01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:58.000
The CBI report had a huge impact.
It changed cricket.

1030
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.800
[crowd cheering]

1031
01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.360
The main thing that we were able to do

1032
01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.120
was start this process
of educating players.

1033
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.800
Now they are told
of the dangers lurking around them.

1034
01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.200
How you can be cultivated.
how you can be trapped.

1035
01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.640
So they can avoid getting corrupted.

1036
01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.000
[bookie on tape. in Hindi] <i>Today
anti-corruption is everywhere.</i>

1037
01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:40.520
<i>An anti-corruption team
stay in the hotel with the players.</i>

1038
01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.080
[crowd clamoring]

1039
01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:47.400
<i>Even if one
is able to get the players' phone numbers.</i>

1040
01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.360
<i>anti-corruption have an eye all over.</i>

1041
01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.680
<i>But gambling is still big.</i>

1042
01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.320
<i>No one can leave it.</i>

1043
01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.920
<i>I have never even tried.</i>

1044
01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.720
<i>This is my job.</i>

1045
01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.560
[Ugra] When I look back at that time.

1046
01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.200
it was almost like growing up.

1047
01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.440
[chuckles] In sports journalism.
it's like saying. "Wake up."

1048
01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.440
Getting a slap on your fae and saying.
"Wake up. This is what real life is like."

1049
01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.720
And so. for me.
the superstars have gone away and faded.

1050
01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.880
but what I love
is being part of the cricket community.

1051
01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.800
Being part of the family.

1052
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.600
[crowd cheering]

1053
01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.240
It always comes back to cricket.

1054
01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.760
because it can just set you alight
with a piece of action

1055
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.840
{\an8}that you can't find in any other sport.

1056
01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:52.440
[commentator] <i>Gone! Off stump...</i>

1057
01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:57.160
<i>Unbelievable performance from India.</i>

1058
01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.200
[in Hindi] I will not be taking
any further legal action.

1059
01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.240
I'm very happy with the court's decision.

1060
01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:26.600
[in English] Uh. the case was overturned
only on account of technical reasons.

1061
01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:30.160
We. in CBI. are absolutely certain

1062
01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.880
that Mr. Mohammed Azharuddin
was involved in match-fixing.

1063
01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:37.960
And we said it
with lot of evidence available at hand.

1064
01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.120
[in Hindi] I want to do
something in cricket

1065
01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.000
because I have played so many years.

1066
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.840
I would want to share my experience

1067
01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.760
with the young generation of cricketers.

1068
01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.920
[reporter] <i>Azhar. uh...</i>

1069
01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.120
[in Hindi] The board is ill-informed.

1070
01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:05.600
and I'm disappointed by its decision.

1071
01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:11.000
which I feel is arbitrary
and discriminatory.

1072
01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:35.280
{\an8}[in English] I do not think
that M.K had any remorse as such.

1073
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.080
He had made enough money

1074
01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.720
and. uh. that it was time for him to.

1075
01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.120
uh. shall we say. enjoy his earnings.

1076
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.800
[reporters clamoring]

1077
01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.440
Now I can go back and sleep properly.

1078
01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.080
Nothing...
Leave it to the government agencies.

1079
01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.320
The allegation
made by Manoj Prabhakar against Kapil Dev

1080
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.640
were not corroborated
by any kind of evidence.

1081
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:19.280
The nation's spirit would have broken
if they found Kapil Dev was involved.

1082
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.120
And to that extent.
I think everybody was very relieved

1083
01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.600
that he's not involved.

1084
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.040
[man. in Hindi] Get the car!

1085
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.600
[indistinct chatter]

1086
01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.480
[Sawani. in English]
When Mukesh Gupta revealed

1087
01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.880
that he had dealings
with Manoj Prabhakar also.

1088
01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.200
that... the entire tables turned.

1089
01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:46.880
Perhaps he may not have been as bold
in taking part in the sting operations

1090
01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.000
if he had ever known
that he himself will be exposed.

1091
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.720
[in Hindi] I never expected that
this thing would end this way.

1092
01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:58.440
I was the one who originally exposed this
in front of the public.

1093
01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:02.200
If I was involved.
I would never have started it.

1094
01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.480
[Bahal] We don't know
the extent. if at all.

1095
01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.640
of Manoj's involvement
in the match-fixing saga.

1096
01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:22.400
We did ask him. we did confront him.
but he denied everything to us.

1097
01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.000
You could say that Manoj Prabhakar

1098
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.880
was possibly
the most gutsy or the most foolish.

1099
01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.960
You know. in that sense.
to me. it was enormously gutsy.
