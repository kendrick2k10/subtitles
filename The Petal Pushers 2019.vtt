           (Minister)           
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall
           not want.            

4
00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:28.594
  He maketh me to lie down in   
        green pastures.         

5
00:00:28.963 --> 00:00:30.929
 He leadeth me beside the still 
            waters.             

6
00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:32.731
     He restoreth my soul:      

7
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:36.201
 He leadeth me in the paths of  
     righteousness for his      
          name's sake.          

8
00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:38.670
 Yea. though I walk through the 
 valley of the shadow of death. 

9
00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:41.507
 I will fear no evil. for Thou  
          art with me;          

10
00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.342
  I never got to say goodbye.

12
00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:48.614
 Thou preparest a table before  
   me in the presence of mine   
            enemies;            

13
00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.949
       Thou anointest my        
       head with the oil.

      My cup runneth over.      

15
00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:56.388
Surely goodness and mercy shall 
  follow me all the days of my  
             life:              

16
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.891
And I will dwell in the House of
       the Lord forever.        

17
00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:00.559

  (Guest 1) Remember when she   
  suddenly kissed our guide in  
         Machu Picchu?          

24
00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:44.323

   what we all wanted to do.

 I'd like to make a toast to my 
       two stepdaughters        

28
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.074
       who have suddenly        
       lost their mother.       

29
00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:07.713
 May we all offer ourselves...  
       in support to them

  Ceil and Emily. you are both  
     like my own daughters.     

33
00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:21.760
I also would like to thank them 
    for the beautiful floral    
           arranging            

34
00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:23.362

        us on this day.         

35
00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:26.031
 I'm sure that they'll pass out 
      their business cards      

36
00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.734
    for any of you that are

         Are you okay?          

40
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:43.582
We're okay. More importantly how
         are you doing?         

41
00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:46.752
  Oh I'm fine. Need a new job   
          I suppose.            

42
00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:48.787
  No. Peter we'll keep you on

43
00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.491
  I don't think so honey. But   
 don't need to worry about me.

      there for two years

91
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:50.161
       Why do I do that?        
    You know I hate olives.     

92
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.764
      I always forget to        
       say no to olives.

        Yes. the woman          
      looked like mother.       

95
00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:57.102
      Can we stop talking       
       about it. please.        

96
00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:59.471
    I'm just sick of being      
       sad all the time.        

97
00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:00.906
      Plus we have other        
     things to worry about.     

98
00:09:00.908 --> 00:09:03.575
 like the fact that we've been  
   living together for eight    
             years.             

99
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.611

 I mean don't you think it's a  
     little weird. though?      

101
00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:11.016
 Don't you want babies someday  
   running around in your own   
             house.             

102
00:09:11.985 --> 00:09:14.686
 Babies. I don't see that in my 
       future. right now.       

103
00:09:15.188 --> 00:09:18.423
 That is exactly what you need. 
        You need babies.        

104
00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:23.094
       Yeah. Oh my God.         
        Look who's here?        

105
00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:26.898
     Hey. Look who's here?      

106
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.877
           Hi Peter.            

107
00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:40.745
     Ceil. Emily. How come      
    you two never stop bye?     

108
00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:44.249
Charles misses you in a bad way.

109
00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:47.419
            So do I.

          I'm Suzanne.          

111
00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:51.656
 Oh. no. Where are my manners?  

112
00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:56.795
Suzanne. This is Ceil and Emily.
My two beautiful stepdaughters. 

113
00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:03.468
How are you Peter. I see you've 
  been doing well apparently.   

114
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:09.441
  Actually Ceil. I'm ah...not   
        doing too well.         

115
00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:13.612
 It's been very very difficult  
   for me but I'm managing to   
            move on.            

116
00:10:14.715 --> 00:10:17.782
   The question is. how are     
      you two holding up?       

117
00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:21.753
We're fine. Peter. Taking it one
         day at a time.         

118
00:10:21.888 --> 00:10:24.823
You know what Emily? We actually
   should go visit. Charles.    

119
00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:27.125
    Maybe look through some

    economy and everything.     

238
00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.348
      I think we're just        
      looking. thank you.       

239
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:15.453
Okay. Well take your time. Feel 
      free to look around.      

240
00:19:16.756 --> 00:19:18.689
        Didn't know you         
      used to sell drugs.       

241
00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:21.392
             What?              

242
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.662
To doctors I mean. Legit stuff. 

243
00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:26.964
     How did you know that?     

244
00:19:27.634 --> 00:19:30.434
 Um. some reporter was in here  
       asking about you.        

245
00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:32.570
 Um. Selma had a chat with her. 

246
00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:34.405
         Where is she?          

247
00:19:34.407 --> 00:19:35.306
              Who?              

248
00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:36.374
             Selma.             

249
00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:38.509
     In the back. I think.      

250
00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:54.258
     Oh! Oh good. It's you      
          Mr. Mahoney.          

251
00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.360
 I don't know how to price this 
             lamp.              

252
00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:58.429
  We'll decide on that later.   
          Okay Selma?           

253
00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:02.233
 Did someone coming last night  
       and ask about me?        

254
00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:06.571
 Oh yes. Very nice young woman. 
        I hope it's ok?         

255
00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:11.242
I told her you worked in a bank 
  and that you were a medicine  
         sales person.          

256
00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:13.778
  You were. right? You told me  
     that a few months ago.     

257
00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:17.348
 She was a writer. She said she 
     was writing an article     

258
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.551
about successful antique dealers
            in town.            

259
00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:24.789
    What did she look like?     

260
00:20:25.825 --> 00:20:32.129
Pretty. Kind-a thin. With light 
  brown hair. Late 20s maybe.   

261
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:34.265
 It's hard to tell these days.  

262
00:20:34.534 --> 00:20:38.269
   I don't think she had any    
      tattoos or anything.      

263
00:20:38.871 --> 00:20:41.305
Kind of a refreshing young lady.

264
00:20:45.345 --> 00:20:47.111
     I didn't do anything       
         wrong. did I?          

265
00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:48.646
              No.               

266
00:20:49.215 --> 00:20:50.881
       No. No you didn't.       

267
00:20:51.017 --> 00:20:53.084
      Just do me the favor      

268
00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:57.555
  and always ask me before you  
   tell people stuff about my   
       background. Okay?        

269
00:20:57.557 --> 00:20:58.689
          Oh yes. Yes.          

270
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:01.325
  I am so sorry. Mr. Mahoney.   

271
00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:06.264
Well. don't worry. We won't talk
    about it anymore. Okay?     

272
00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:09.767
    Just do me a favor and      
       don't do it again.       

273
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:15.273
  Okay? Okay. You can go get a  
         sandwich now.          

274
00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:19.410
         Yes. I agree.          

275
00:21:19.412 --> 00:21:22.280
We find that daycare worker when
      we locate the perp.       

276
00:21:23.249 --> 00:21:24.482
        Nice work Jess.         

277
00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:29.186
   Oh. hey Jess. I got to go.   
    Something just came up.     

278
00:21:30.056 --> 00:21:31.656
     Who's the perp at the      
        daycare center?         

279
00:21:31.658 --> 00:21:33.124
    Do I even want to know?     

280
00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:34.992
       Ah. No. You don't.       

281
00:21:35.762 --> 00:21:39.864
 Um. Have a seat. How'd you get 
       back here anyway?        

282
00:21:40.066 --> 00:21:42.700
 Ah. the guy. Hennessey. said I 
     could come back here.      

283
00:21:42.702 --> 00:21:44.168
        Ahh. Hennessey.         

284
00:21:45.238 --> 00:21:46.704
 I have had a question for you. 

285
00:21:46.873 --> 00:21:48.472
       Of course. Shoot.        

286
00:21:48.608 --> 00:21:50.675
     What does it take to       
         exhume a body?         

287
00:21:51.944 --> 00:21:54.779
 Ahh. a warrant and a very good 
            reason.             

288
00:21:55.248 --> 00:21:59.884
Okay. well this may sound crazy 
   and it may turn out to be    
       completely trivial       

289
00:21:59.886 --> 00:22:01.786
 but my mother died in January. 

290
00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:03.905
        They said it was        
         a heart attack         

291
00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:06.023
 but it was just a mitral valve 
 thingy. It wasn't a big deal.  

292
00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:08.292
  Did the M.E. do an autopsy?   

293
00:22:08.294 --> 00:22:10.561
      No. Supposedly she        
        didn't want one.        

294
00:22:11.264 --> 00:22:12.763
     What was the official      
        cause of death?         

295
00:22:12.765 --> 00:22:14.131
         Heart failure.         

296
00:22:14.901 --> 00:22:17.234
      And was anyone with       
      her when she died?        

297
00:22:17.403 --> 00:22:20.037
  Yes. Peter Mahoney. He's an   
         antique dealer         

298
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.707
and yes I did google him. a lot.

299
00:22:24.077 --> 00:22:26.577
   I'd be disappointed if you   
            didn't.             

300
00:22:26.813 --> 00:22:29.113
  Like I said before. he was a  
   pharmaceutical sales rep.    

301
00:22:29.115 --> 00:22:32.850
   before he met my mother.     
       He a lot to gain.        

302
00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:35.252
    I mean he was 20 years      
       younger than her.        

303
00:22:35.655 --> 00:22:39.256
And you think he may have given 
  her some pills to cause her   
         heart attack.          

304
00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:44.762
Maybe. I don't know. Am I crazy?

305
00:22:45.164 --> 00:22:48.232
   No. not at all. You're...    
           concerned.           

306
00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:55.906
Um. by any chance did you happen
    to bring Peter Mohoney's    
     information with you?      

307
00:22:56.442 --> 00:22:58.676
        Yes. yes I did.         

308
00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:07.551
           Thank you.           

309
00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:09.854
           All right.           

310
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.625
  You know. um. I'm really not  
   supposed to be doing this    

311
00:23:14.627 --> 00:23:18.796
but I'll run a background check 
            for you.            

312
00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:21.065
             Great.             

313
00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:23.200
 What's the best way to contact 
              you?              

314
00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:24.535
             Ah...              

315
00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:28.105
   Here you go. that's mine.    

316

     Oh. you're a florist.      

317
00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:34.979
 Yeah. So you'll call me if you 
         find anything?         

318
00:23:34.981 --> 00:23:35.980
            I will.             

319
00:23:35.982 --> 00:23:36.881
          Okay. great.          

320
00:23:38.718 --> 00:23:40.017
      Have an awesome day.      

321
00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:41.585
            Thanks.             

322
00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:45.256
     Have an awesome day.       
       What am I saying?        

323
00:24:08.581 --> 00:24:10.581
I don't really feel like playing
      Clue tonight. Emily.      

324
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.183
Don't want to know what he said?

325
00:24:12.418 --> 00:24:13.317
              Nope              

326
00:24:13.319 --> 00:24:17.221
He's gonna run a check on Peter.
  He's going to help us Ceil.   

327
00:24:17.223 --> 00:24:18.722
 That's because he wants to get 
         in your pants.         

328
00:24:18.724 --> 00:24:20.224
      He's not like that.       

329
00:24:20.226 --> 00:24:22.426
 Will you stop being so naive.  

330
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:26.363
 You know. I really think this  
 is going to be the last straw  
     between us. I know it.     

331
00:24:27.033 --> 00:24:30.100
  Maybe I just think we should  
sell the business and separate. 

332
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.704
We are not selling the business.

333

We're gonna make whoever killed 
     our mother pay for it.

      What are you doing?

 You're not smoking. You're not 
    drinking. We need to be     
   centered right now. okay?    

338

   her at all. She could be a

 Good for you. It's about time  
    you started to exercise.    

344
00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:08.973
  It will help you relax and

I'm not as good a shape you are.

357
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.585
   Oh and you're including my   
       family. How nice.        

358
00:26:27.853 --> 00:26:31.355
Well I can tell you.. everything
  about me if you really want   
             me to.             

359
00:26:31.357 --> 00:26:33.457
 I mean. I feel like. you know. 

360
00:26:33.726 --> 00:26:35.926
      You and I get along       
    pretty well if we tried.    

361
00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:37.828
         Let go my arm.         

362
00:26:38.197 --> 00:26:41.231
Oh. it was nice seeing you. Em. 

363
00:26:46.772 --> 00:26:50.341
  Hey. Hey hey. wait a minute.  
 Wait a minute. Hey. watch the  
             desk.              

364
00:26:57.917 --> 00:26:59.350
             Damn.              

365
00:26:59.885 --> 00:27:01.218
             - Oh.              
           - Oh. Hey            

366
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.188
       Sorry. detective.        
      I tried to stop her.      

367
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.324
Oh. don't worry officer Morgan. 
        She's a friend.         

368
00:27:08.928 --> 00:27:11.328
    Come on in. Have a seat.    

369
00:27:12.865 --> 00:27:15.132
   You have to do something.    
        He followed me.         

370
00:27:15.134 --> 00:27:16.100
              Who?              

371
00:27:16.102 --> 00:27:17.001
          In the park.          

372
00:27:17.236 --> 00:27:18.135
       Who followed you?        

373
00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:19.036
             Peter.             

374
00:27:19.238 --> 00:27:20.855
        The Mahoney guy?        

375
00:27:20.856 --> 00:27:22.473
 The Mahoney guy. yes. Did you  
        check up on him?        

376
00:27:23.209 --> 00:27:28.278
 Yes. I found out a little bit. 
         Ah. he moved           
      around a lot and ah.      

377
00:27:28.414 --> 00:27:31.115
 I know he was married before.  
            he's...             

378
00:27:32.585 --> 00:27:33.517
             Oh...              

379
00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:35.319
You didn't know he was married? 

380
00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:37.154
  No. I was not aware of that.  

381
00:27:37.623 --> 00:27:40.858
Well. I'm going to lock down who
  she was in a little bit. um.  

382
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.826
   So what did he say to you?   

383
00:27:43.095 --> 00:27:46.163
 He asked me why I was checking 
        in on his past.         

384
00:27:46.966 --> 00:27:48.365
     And what did you say?      

385
00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:53.637
   I said that I was doing a    
   genealogy thing. a family    
        history project.        

386
00:27:53.639 --> 00:27:56.473
I know. It was really stupid. He
      was threatening me.       

387
00:27:57.143 --> 00:27:58.242
    How did he threaten you?    

388
00:27:58.511 --> 00:28:00.611
       He grabbed my arm        
     and he got in my face.     

389
00:28:00.613 --> 00:28:05.315
  and he said something creepy  
    about us getting closer.    

390
00:28:05.651 --> 00:28:07.584
He was sniffing me or something.

391
00:28:08.654 --> 00:28:12.423
Okay. listen. I really need you 
  to stay away from this guy.   

392
00:28:12.658 --> 00:28:15.759
   Alright. I'm going to do a   
 little more fact checking and  
     I'll give you a call.      

393
00:28:15.761 --> 00:28:19.029
   But as far as right now is   
           concerned            
let's just keep this between us.

394
00:28:19.999 --> 00:28:21.065
              Okay              

395
00:28:22.535 --> 00:28:25.169
      Why are we keeping        
         it between us?         

396
00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:29.707
 Because we don't exactly have  
  enough to open up an official 
           case. yet.           

397
00:28:30.276 --> 00:28:33.177
But it's okay. It's just normal 
           procedure.           

398
00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:36.880
 As soon as I have something. I 
    am going to do something    
           about it.            

399
00:28:38.384 --> 00:28:43.187
  Okay. Thank you for helping   
           me....us.            

400
00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:45.055
          No problem.           

401
00:28:48.227 --> 00:28:50.794
          Be careful.           

402
00:28:54.633 --> 00:28:57.401
  So he's been married before.  
 It's not like that's illegal.  

403
00:28:57.536 --> 00:28:58.869
But why didn't we know about it?

404
00:28:59.071 --> 00:29:00.471
  Because he didn't want us to  
             know.              

405
00:29:00.473 --> 00:29:01.572
    What else don't we know?    

406
00:29:01.974 --> 00:29:03.874
Other things he doesn't want us 
            to know.            

407
00:29:03.876 --> 00:29:06.577
 You're being really obsessive  
 about this. Do you know that?  

408
00:29:07.546 --> 00:29:11.248
Am I obsessing or do I just want
    to know what happened to    
          our mother.           

409
00:29:11.684 --> 00:29:13.150
 Oh. you mean the one who had a 
         heart attack.          

410
00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:16.854
Okay. Sorry. That wasn't funny. 

411
00:29:16.856 --> 00:29:19.890
   Look. he checked up on you   
 because you checked up on him. 

412
00:29:20.025 --> 00:29:22.893
and he's been married before but
   that doesn't mean you have   
       to arrest the guy.       

413
00:29:26.232 --> 00:29:28.599
      Shit. Did it again.       

414
00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:33.103
   Look. I don't know how to    
describe it but his behavior was
          really odd.           

415
00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:35.339
 Yeah. him running is just odd. 

416
00:29:35.508 --> 00:29:37.007
  Yeah. especially in a suit.   

417
00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:38.058
             What?              

418
00:29:38.059 --> 00:29:39.108
  Yeah. he looked ridiculous.   

419
00:29:39.545 --> 00:29:42.279
         What a goon.           
 Well your cop's on it. right?  

420
00:29:43.048 --> 00:29:46.750
  He's not my cop. And now we   
  don't even have a case yet.   

421
00:29:47.353 --> 00:29:49.086
     Well. it's good that       
         he's into you.         

422
00:29:49.889 --> 00:29:52.189
 I don't... know that he's into 
              me.               

423
00:29:52.191 --> 00:29:54.258
     Sure he is. It's good.     

424
00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:57.961
  Ah. ha ha ha. Your the best.  

425
00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:01.632
  And with your past. that's a  
          compliment.           

426
00:30:02.268 --> 00:30:04.368
   I don't know what you are    
         talking about.         

427
00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:10.174
  Okay. so what's up with the   
         Snoop sisters?         

428
00:30:10.943 --> 00:30:13.143
  I think I got to Emily this   
            morning.            

429
00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:17.447
She's timid. She's not going to 
    go anywhere with any of     
             this.              

430
00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:21.385
I don't know. You have to watch 
    out for the timid ones.     

431
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.787
    Don't worry. I got this.    

432
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:27.791
 Yes. but seriously. what about 
         the other one.         

433
00:30:28.427 --> 00:30:31.161
  She does seem like a little   
     flower. She's meaner.      

434
00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:33.297
        I handled worse.        

435
00:30:33.632 --> 00:30:34.565
            Really?             

436
00:30:34.834 --> 00:30:35.732
             Yeah!              

437
00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:38.468
         Oh. excuse me.         

438
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:41.572
 That's Okay Charles. It's not  
   like we are in the act or    
           anything.            

439
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:47.311
  I was just wondering if you   
  still need me any more this   
        afternoon. sir?         

440
00:30:47.446 --> 00:30:48.912
     No. I don't think so.      

441
00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:49.813
           You sure?            

442
00:30:49.815 --> 00:30:51.598
             Yeah.              

443
00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:53.382
Hey. Why don't you take a couple
    of bills. I'll treat you    
           to lunch.            

444
00:30:54.486 --> 00:30:57.688
       No thank you. sir.       
    I can buy my own lunch.     

445
00:30:57.857 --> 00:30:59.056
         Suit yourself.         

446
00:31:01.694 --> 00:31:03.260
 I think you offended the help. 

447
00:31:03.262 --> 00:31:04.194
          Like I care.          

448
00:31:04.196 --> 00:31:05.629
        Oh. you bad boy.        

449
00:31:05.631 --> 00:31:08.332
 I'm going to fire him. but not 
           right now.           
     It wouldn't look good.     

450
00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:17.174
Just a few more months. Okay? I 
      got to the work now.      

451
00:31:17.543 --> 00:31:19.243
And then we can get out of here.

452
00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:21.345
         Ah. I hope so.         

453
00:31:41.133 --> 00:31:45.636
  Can see right. right there.   
            Alright.            

454
00:31:45.638 --> 00:31:48.972
 Hey. well just hold onto that  
   and we'll we'll play some    
          more. okay?           

455
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:51.108
      Can I help you sir?       

456
00:31:51.377 --> 00:31:53.644
Ah. no. I'm just looking around.

457
00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:56.480
    But you have some really    
     wonderful stuff here.      

458
00:31:57.249 --> 00:32:00.751
 Thank you. Well. I'll let you  
       browse some peace.       

459
00:32:01.186 --> 00:32:02.686
    Just let me know if you     
      have any questions.       

460
00:32:02.688 --> 00:32:03.587
            I will.             

461
00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:09.760
       Where were we. Ah.       
     Let me show you this.      

462

   This is an obelisk of fun.   
  Yeah. Yes. Ancient Egyptian.  

463
00:32:16.068 --> 00:32:18.602
  And if you can see right on   
   the bottom it's described    
             here.              

464
00:32:18.604 --> 00:32:20.470
    This might help again.      
       Just take a look.        

465
00:32:26.278 --> 00:32:27.210
              Hey.

00:32:27.212 --> 00:32:28.612
        Hi. I'm working.        

467
00:32:29.548 --> 00:32:30.864
      There's no one here.      

468
00:32:30.865 --> 00:32:32.181
  Yeah. you should have seen    
        it an hour ago.         

469
00:32:32.184 --> 00:32:33.250
      Oh. yeah. Busy bee?

00:32:33.252 --> 00:32:34.284

             - Hi.              

471
00:32:34.286 --> 00:32:35.185

 I don't want you to meet her.  
     She's the pretty one.      

474
00:32:41.093 --> 00:32:43.527

   you do with your tongue -

        wasting my time.

00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:01.237
  Oh no. You can't be serious.  

590
00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:02.605
Come on. help me move the body. 

591
00:39:02.607 --> 00:39:04.574
     I'm not touching him.      
          Is he dead?           

592
00:39:04.576 --> 00:39:05.508
             Emily!             

593
00:39:09.181 --> 00:39:11.548
   It's quite the invention.    
           isn't it?            

594
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.350
              Huh.              

595
00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:14.684
              Ugg.              

596
00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:17.053
   You alright? It looks like   
      you've seen a ghost.      

597
00:39:18.156 --> 00:39:20.423
    It's nothing. What's up?    

598
00:39:21.026 --> 00:39:22.192
       We got that tape.        

599
00:39:23.862 --> 00:39:25.195
Okay. I'll be there in a second.

600
00:39:37.442 --> 00:39:38.508
          [locks door]          

601
00:39:46.852 --> 00:39:48.351
 I'm going to barf any minute.  

602
00:39:48.487 --> 00:39:50.153
Well if you do you can do it in 
           the sink.            

603
00:39:50.155 --> 00:39:52.355
I've had just about enough gross
          for one day.          

604
00:39:56.528 --> 00:39:57.694
          [door knock]          

605
00:39:58.063 --> 00:39:59.696
     What is he doing here?     

606
00:39:59.698 --> 00:40:02.632
  Oh God. What do we do? Don't  
           leave me.            

607
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.504
              Hi.               

608
00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:09.339
  Is everything okay? We just   
    heard some loud noises.     

609
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:12.342
Oh. everything is fine. We just 
      dropped a big vase.       

610
00:40:12.344 --> 00:40:14.544
       made a huge mess.        
    Spilled some pesticides.    

611
00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:17.080
I can send my wife over to help 
         you clean up.          

612
00:40:17.082 --> 00:40:20.583
 Oh. that is so nice but really 
       everything's fine.       

613
00:40:21.052 --> 00:40:22.385
        Well okay. then.        

614
00:40:22.387 --> 00:40:25.989
I'm sorry. We won't do it again 
   but I love your food. Bye.   

615
00:40:30.228 --> 00:40:31.995
     Maybe he should have       
     come in and helped us.     

616
00:40:31.997 --> 00:40:33.229
         Are you nuts?          

617
00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:35.665
Yes. And apparently so are you. 

618
00:40:35.834 --> 00:40:37.700
I don't care. I'm just glad this
      douche bag is dead.       

619
00:40:37.702 --> 00:40:38.668
            Really?             

620
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.969
     Yeah. he was terrible.     

621
00:40:40.272 --> 00:40:41.438
     So you believe me now?     

622
00:40:41.573 --> 00:40:44.507
Yeah. I guess. What comes around
      goes around. right?       

623
00:40:44.509 --> 00:40:48.011
I've never heard of karma being 
   used as defense in a case    
            before.             

624
00:40:48.747 --> 00:40:51.214
 We have to call the police and 
tell them it was some accident. 

625
00:40:51.216 --> 00:40:52.582
  It was sort of an accident.   

626
00:40:52.717 --> 00:40:54.517
  It was sort of self defense.  

627
00:40:54.753 --> 00:40:56.519
   It was an accident. Celia.   

628
00:40:56.788 --> 00:41:00.323
I feel like I'm in first grade. 
   Can you please not call me   
             Celia.             

629
00:41:01.626 --> 00:41:05.328
 The cops are going to want to  
  know why we didn't stop him   
    from drinking the stuff.    

630
00:41:05.564 --> 00:41:07.163
         Why didn't we?         

631
00:41:07.299 --> 00:41:08.731
       I was too scared.        

632
00:41:08.733 --> 00:41:10.066
      So it self defense.       

633
00:41:10.068 --> 00:41:12.302
   I mean it's definitely not   
          murder one.           

634
00:41:12.304 --> 00:41:13.536
    What's after murder one?    

635
00:41:13.705 --> 00:41:17.540
        Will you stop?          
      We didn't kill him.       

636
00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:19.709
  It's just as well you became  
  friends with our local cop.   

637
00:41:19.878 --> 00:41:22.946
He's not my friend. Shit. I need
       to call him back.        

638
00:41:23.148 --> 00:41:25.949
  You know what? Maybe that'll  
 help. Guys will do anything to 
           get laid.            

639
00:41:25.951 --> 00:41:28.918
If you sleep with him. maybe he 
       won't turn you in.       

640
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.987
       You're disgusting.       
        I'm not a slut.         

641
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:34.791
   Yeah. I have to get rid of   
  Justin. too. I just have to   
        figure out how.         

642
00:41:35.727 --> 00:41:38.828
Meanwhile we will keep him here 
   until we figure out a new    
         spot for him.          

643
00:41:40.332 --> 00:41:42.332
How long do you think he'll keep
           in there?            

644
00:41:42.501 --> 00:41:44.200
   Till we decide what to do.   

645
00:41:44.736 --> 00:41:47.470
We just tell our customers he's 
    part of an arrangement.     

646
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:53.409
         [phone rings]          

647

           <i> right now.</i>          

648

650
00:42:07.759 --> 00:42:11.094
Hey. detective Fry this is Emily
             Scott.             

651
00:42:11.263 --> 00:42:13.363
 So sorry I didn't get back to  
         you yesterday.         

652
00:42:13.498 --> 00:42:15.865
   I got hammered with a last   
          minute job.           

653
00:42:16.001 --> 00:42:19.269
  but I am looking forward to   
   talking with you tomorrow.   

654
00:42:19.538 --> 00:42:21.337
       Thank you so much        
       for all your help.       

655
00:42:35.186 --> 00:42:37.520
 We open in an hour and a half. 

656
00:42:38.023 --> 00:42:39.522
            I know.             

657
00:42:39.991 --> 00:42:43.192
  I am totally and completely   
             numb.              

658
00:42:43.495 --> 00:42:45.361
  I think we need to move him.  

659
00:42:45.564 --> 00:42:46.563
             Where?             

660
00:42:46.965 --> 00:42:49.766
    In here. Until we figure    
      something else out.       

661
00:42:50.068 --> 00:42:52.368
 Can't we just leave it in the  
         refrigerator?          

662
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:55.238
Gosh Emily. I'm pretty sure that
    would take away from the    
            orchids.            

663
00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:58.608
  Look. why don't we just call  
the police and get it over with.

664
00:42:58.743 --> 00:43:01.778
       No. I tried that.        
     They won't believe us.     

665
00:43:03.315 --> 00:43:04.781
We're going to be on death row. 

666
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.484
Yeah. it's okay. It takes years 
   these days. We can appeal.   

667
00:43:10.355 --> 00:43:12.555
 why don't we just call him and 
  tell him it was an accident.  

668
00:43:12.557 --> 00:43:14.223
  okay. we panicked. we didn't  
        know what to do.        

669
00:43:14.225 --> 00:43:18.161
It was an accident. There's got 
       to be another way.       

670
00:43:19.831 --> 00:43:22.632
 We could always bury the body  
   and pretend like it never    
           happened.            

671
00:43:23.935 --> 00:43:25.368
     You can't be serious?      

672
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:28.438
Come on. Em. Is a guy like Peter
   really going to be missed?   

673
00:43:29.174 --> 00:43:30.773
    Of course. you nut case.    

674
00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:40.516
  Okay. breathe girl. breathe.  

675
00:43:40.685 --> 00:43:42.752
 If you need a paper bag. there 
  are some under the counter.   

676
00:43:42.887 --> 00:43:44.687
 I can't look at him any more.  

677
00:43:44.923 --> 00:43:47.156
     I think he actually l      
       looks better dead.       

678
00:43:47.359 --> 00:43:48.691
At least there is no smell yet. 

679
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.327
 Oh. I forgot about the smell.  

680
00:43:53.865 --> 00:43:54.764
            Uggg...             

681
00:43:54.766 --> 00:43:57.233
   To think I almost went to    
        nursing school.         

682
00:43:57.235 --> 00:43:58.601
      There's still time.       

683
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.136
             Funny.             

684
00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:03.473
           Jeez. God.           

685
00:44:03.708 --> 00:44:06.976
    My God. he is so thin.      
     Why is he so heavy?        

686
00:44:07.245 --> 00:44:08.811
  Think we're going to need a   
         bigger carpet.         

687
00:44:08.813 --> 00:44:10.513
Oh. now you decide to be funny. 

688
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.630
 How are we going to get him up 
          the stairs?           

689
00:44:27.799 --> 00:44:30.233
I don't know. A little chutzpah.

690
00:44:30.602 --> 00:44:33.770
Can't we just put him in the van
    and move him somewhere?     

691
00:44:33.772 --> 00:44:37.340
 I mean. we're going to have to 
 take him down the stairs in a  
       few hours anyway.        

692
00:44:37.342 --> 00:44:40.843
Where are we going to go. Emily.
   The park? Is it bury your    
           dead day?            

693
00:44:41.146 --> 00:44:43.579
Besides he is going to come down
    the stairs a lot faster.    

694
00:44:43.581 --> 00:44:44.881
  I just want this over with.   

695
00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:47.817
 Yeah. So do I. But I think we  
  need the cover of darkness.   

696
00:44:47.819 --> 00:44:51.020
    So. come on. Up we go.      
          Grab a leg.           

697
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.403
        [rhythmic thuds]        

698
00:45:18.383 --> 00:45:20.183
 Are you sure we can trust him? 

699
00:45:20.185 --> 00:45:22.452
 Of course we can. Remember how 
         he met daddy?          

700
00:45:22.787 --> 00:45:24.287
 Yeah. that's what worries me.  

701
00:45:24.289 --> 00:45:26.022
Secrecy was part of his job. Em.

702
00:45:26.157 --> 00:45:27.724
        Part of his job.        

703
00:45:27.726 --> 00:45:29.125
  Not sure we want to know the  
          other part.           

704
00:45:30.729 --> 00:45:33.796
Right. Why should I be worried. 
  Of course we can trust him.   

705
00:45:34.999 --> 00:45:36.799
  I wonder how dad would have   
        dealt with this?        

706
00:45:36.801 --> 00:45:40.436
Probably would've done the same 
thing. but it wouldn't have been
          an accident.          

707
00:45:44.743 --> 00:45:48.377
 You think you should be going  
           that fast.           
  We have a dead body in back.  

708
00:45:58.356 --> 00:46:00.022
       I'm going to die         
      from all this work.       

709
00:46:00.024 --> 00:46:02.625
         Keep digging.          
    This isn't deep enough.     

710
00:46:02.861 --> 00:46:04.927
Cadaver dogs could still pick up
           the scent.           

711
00:46:04.929 --> 00:46:06.062
     Hey. where's Suzanne?      

712
00:46:06.064 --> 00:46:09.532
She's out like a light. A little
   special tea did the trick.   

713
00:46:09.534 --> 00:46:11.100
      Oh yeah. We should        
         bury her next.         

714
00:46:11.102 --> 00:46:12.101
             Ceil!              

715
00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:14.137
  I'm kidding. Let's go. It's   
         getting late.          

716
00:46:22.747 --> 00:46:24.080
     It's not deep enough.      

717
00:46:24.082 --> 00:46:25.481
         I told you so.         

718
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:26.816
           [dog bark]           

719
00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:36.092
They have a great chili omelet. 

720
00:46:36.227 --> 00:46:40.630
I'll pass. You know. chili just 
    doesn't scream breakfast    
          food to me.           

721
00:46:41.266 --> 00:46:42.799
    There's an egg in here.     

722
00:46:44.035 --> 00:46:47.003
   What was so important you    
     couldn't just text me.     

723
00:46:52.544 --> 00:46:54.277
          What is it?           

724
00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:56.011
  Isn't this the guy that you   
were looking at for that babe?. 

725
00:46:56.714 --> 00:46:59.816
Her name is Emily. But yeah. it 
   is. When did this come in?   

726
00:46:59.818 --> 00:47:01.450
         This morning.          

727
00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.854
        Do we know who          
       Suzanne Hammer is?       

728
00:47:05.223 --> 00:47:08.491
     Apparently she is his      
          girlfriend.           

729
00:47:08.893 --> 00:47:10.726
The boys said she went ballistic
       when they told her       

730
00:47:10.728 --> 00:47:12.295
  that we couldn't do anything  
          right away.           

731
00:47:12.664 --> 00:47:15.698
so they took her report just to 
        get rid of her.         

732
00:47:16.301 --> 00:47:17.333
      They took a report?       

733
00:47:17.635 --> 00:47:22.205
     Yeah. I'd say we can       
        open a case now.        

734
00:47:22.407 --> 00:47:24.140
           Maybe. Um.           

735
00:47:25.243 --> 00:47:28.044
Hey. could you do me a favor and
  cover me at the station for   
            an hour?            

736
00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.680
 Don't press your luck with the 
        captain. Bryce.         

737
00:47:30.682 --> 00:47:33.749
 I won't. I've just got a hunch 
     I've got to check out.     

738
00:47:34.352 --> 00:47:36.152
  I'll be back soon. alright?   

739
00:47:36.421 --> 00:47:39.155
    Sure think. Can't wait.     

740
00:47:42.093 --> 00:47:46.362
I know baby. I'm so sorry but we
 are up to our ears in orders.  

741
00:47:46.364 --> 00:47:49.632
 I promise I will make it up to 
     you next week. though.     

742
00:47:49.634 --> 00:47:52.735
    Okay. I love you. too.      
           Bye Bunny.           

743
00:47:54.172 --> 00:47:56.172
     How long do you think      
     you can keep him away?     

744
00:47:56.174 --> 00:47:58.574
  Well. he just started a new   
 project. so that should help.  

745
00:48:00.144 --> 00:48:03.746
Ugg. I'm screwing up everything.
  I can't find a receipt for a  
         funeral order.         

746
00:48:04.482 --> 00:48:07.884
 Okay. okay look. Why don't we  
 close the shop for another day 

747
00:48:07.886 --> 00:48:09.452
     and that will give us      
   some extra time to think?    

748
00:48:09.988 --> 00:48:12.855
       Yeah. Another day        
        ought to do it.         

749
00:48:19.697 --> 00:48:20.763
          [door bell]           

750
00:48:22.567 --> 00:48:25.735
           Oh sorry.            
     We're actually closed.     
           Inventory.           

751
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.738
  I see. Um. Is Emily around?   

752
00:48:29.874 --> 00:48:30.806
           Oh my god.           

753
00:48:30.808 --> 00:48:31.540
              Hey.              

754
00:48:31.542 --> 00:48:32.375
              Hi.               

755
00:48:33.845 --> 00:48:34.944
 Oh. let me help you with that. 

756
00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:38.748
   Oh. Don't worry about it.    
            Got it.             

757
00:48:41.019 --> 00:48:43.085
          All better.           

758
00:48:44.722 --> 00:48:45.788
         [throat clear]         

759
00:48:47.058 --> 00:48:51.894
Where are my manners? Bryce this
 is Ceil. It's short for Celia. 

760
00:48:52.163 --> 00:48:54.230
      She's my sister and       
      my business partner.      

761
00:48:54.666 --> 00:48:55.998
      Detective Bryce Fry.      

762
00:48:57.835 --> 00:48:59.568
   What can we help you with?   

763
00:49:00.872 --> 00:49:04.140
    Um. I think I have some     
interesting information for you.

764
00:49:04.909 --> 00:49:09.111
 I left you a few messages but  
    you didn't call me back.    

765
00:49:09.614 --> 00:49:12.415
   You know. we had a big big   
         wedding order          

766
00:49:12.417 --> 00:49:17.420
   and I've just been running   
around. So I was actually about 
       to call you... ah        

767
00:49:17.555 --> 00:49:20.356
 You know what? What exactly do 
   you mean when you say you    
           have some            

768
00:49:20.358 --> 00:49:22.925
interesting information for us? 

769
00:49:23.361 --> 00:49:26.963
Peter Mahoney. is now officially
       a missing person.        

770
00:49:29.434 --> 00:49:35.805
Oh wow. Yeah. that sure is him. 
     Where did you get that     
         picture from?          

771
00:49:36.274 --> 00:49:38.341
      From his girlfriend.      

772
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:40.209
       Girlfriend. Right.       

773
00:49:45.984 --> 00:49:48.851
       Well missing. Hey.       

774
00:49:49.087 --> 00:49:54.390
 Yes. missing. Ah. when was the 
  last time either of you two   
            saw him.            

775
00:49:54.726 --> 00:49:58.461
 Oh gosh. That... a while ago.  

776
00:49:59.163 --> 00:50:03.366
At the park. Remember we talked 
     about that. The park.      

777
00:50:04.502 --> 00:50:07.169
        Right. The park.        

778
00:50:14.912 --> 00:50:20.082
Well. I see you two are busy. so
    I'll let you get to it.     
     I'll check back later?     

779
00:50:20.418 --> 00:50:22.418
   Great! Hope you find him.    

780
00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:23.686
    Nice to meet you. Ceil.     

781
00:50:24.455 --> 00:50:26.022
    Oh. you too. detective.     

782
00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:37.099
    Really good job. Emily.     

783
00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:38.100
         What did I do?         

784
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.340
  Well. now he's suspicious...  

785
00:50:44.342 --> 00:50:48.444
    You know. actually. um.     
  my aunt is in the hospital.   

786
00:50:48.446 --> 00:50:52.748
I probably should take a look at
some flowers. Can I take a peak?

787
00:50:53.051 --> 00:50:54.450
     Sure. Go right ahead.      

788
00:50:54.452 --> 00:50:56.585
I love your store. bye the way. 

789
00:50:56.721 --> 00:50:58.120
         (Ceil & Emily)         
           Thank you.           

790
00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:02.058
   Wow. You guys are classy.    
    These don't come cheap.     

791
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.061
You know. why don't you just go 
   ahead and grab a bouquet.    
       It's on the house.       

792
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:14.036
Isn't this your. mother's. card?

793
00:51:14.038 --> 00:51:17.907
   Oh my God. Yes. How do you   
suppose that got in there. Ceil?

794
00:51:18.876 --> 00:51:20.643
         I don't know.          
     That is really weird.      

795
00:51:20.645 --> 00:51:24.613
  You know. we haven't cleaned  
 that out in quite a while. So. 
          no telling.           

796
00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:28.484
  Well. I would just make sure  
    that account is closed.     

797
00:51:28.486 --> 00:51:31.153
Yeah. Let's do that right away. 

798
00:51:31.155 --> 00:51:34.156
 Thanks for the offer but it's  
    against the rules. so...    

799
00:51:35.827 --> 00:51:38.260
   She likes candy anyway.      
           Ha ha ha.            

800
00:51:38.262 --> 00:51:40.096
  Have a great day. Thank you.  

801
00:51:40.098 --> 00:51:42.264
        Bye. detective.         

802
00:51:47.238 --> 00:51:50.906
     So that is your cop?       
       He's kind of cute.       

803
00:51:51.075 --> 00:51:53.342
        He's not my cop.        

804
00:51:53.343 --> 00:51:55.610
 Yeah. but aren't you glad you  
 went to the police. You know?  
           For help.            

805
00:51:55.913 --> 00:51:58.414
    Shut up. Don't blame me.    

806
00:51:58.416 --> 00:52:00.583
  I'm not the one that offered  
         free flowers.          

807
00:52:00.785 --> 00:52:02.118
  Now what are we going to do?  

808
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.254
       Well. we have to         
     move the body. again.      

809
00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:07.790
 Oh my God. I wish I were dead. 

810
00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:22.605
        You want a bite.        

811
00:52:23.774 --> 00:52:25.207
           I'll pass.           

812
00:52:26.744 --> 00:52:28.110
         How did it go?         

813
00:52:28.446 --> 00:52:29.478
            Strange.            

814
00:52:29.647 --> 00:52:32.515
      You tell them about       
       baloney. Mahoney.        

815
00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:33.916
     Yes. I did tell them.      

816
00:52:33.918 --> 00:52:34.817
              And?              

817
00:52:35.153 --> 00:52:37.486
 Something seems out of kilter. 

818
00:52:38.289 --> 00:52:39.788
What's that mean; out of kilter?

819
00:52:40.958 --> 00:52:44.393
  I'm not sure. what it means.  
      What about the car?       

820
00:52:45.229 --> 00:52:46.996
        Missing as well.        

821
00:52:48.299 --> 00:52:50.366
   I don't know. Maybe it's a   
         female thing.          

822
00:52:50.601 --> 00:52:55.304
 Women. right. Got to love em;  
 second only to their vaginas.  

823
00:52:55.973 --> 00:52:56.939
      You want my opinion?      

824
00:52:56.941 --> 00:52:58.457
              No.               

825
00:52:58.458 --> 00:52:59.974
 We don't even have a case yet. 
   Why don't you let somebody   
        else handle it.         

826
00:52:59.977 --> 00:53:01.177
        Save your neck.         

827
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:06.649
  This woman has had a strange

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:14.190
       That was strange.

839
00:53:54.881 --> 00:53:57.365
You know who. Peter. He has been
 missing for almost three days. 

840
00:53:57.501 --> 00:53:58.667
   Looks like you got dumped.   

841
00:53:58.669 --> 00:54:00.069
       Ceil. Let her in.

00:54:01.639 --> 00:54:02.905
           Thank you.           

843
00:54:03.174 --> 00:54:04.440
       What's the matter?       

844
00:54:06.244 --> 00:54:11.280
   Charles hasn't seen him. I   
 haven't seen him. but I think  
    you two know something.     

845
00:54:11.716 --> 00:54:14.316
 I guess he skipped town. gonna 
      set up something new      

846
00:54:14.318 --> 00:54:16.619
      with someone who is       
    not mentally challenged.    

847
00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:24.326
     You bitch! He wouldn't     
        do that to me.          

848
00:54:24.328 --> 00:54:27.096
  Yes he would. We killed our   
   mother for all her money.    

849
00:54:27.365 --> 00:54:29.231
        so dumping you          
      would mean nothing.       

850
00:54:30.835 --> 00:54:33.269
     Well then why is his       
  car parked down the street?   

851
00:54:36.841 --> 00:54:38.841
       You're mistaken.         
      He hasn't been here.

       think about that?

         Yes. I'm sure.

      We have to tell him.

      Don't worry. Ceil.        
     It's going to be okay.

946
01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:11.633
      I'm going to fry in       
      the electric chair.       

947
01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:14.503
       We don't use the         
    electric chair anymore.     

948
01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.004
              Oh?               

949
01:01:17.975 --> 01:01:21.910
  She was very angry. She came  
  into the shop and she made a  
             scene.             

950
01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:23.478
  and then she left in a huff.  

951
01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.715
 She didn't even see the car.   
        It was horrible.        

952
01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:29.818
  Are you going to take us in?  

953
01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:32.587
      Did you run or over?      

954
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:34.322
       No of course not.        

955
01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:36.525
        Your the second         
      person to ask that.       

956
01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:40.696
Why didn't you call the police? 

957
01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:47.569
 I don't know. I guess we were  
 just in shock and I saw other  
      people calling them.      

958
01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:55.510
Do you want me to tell you what 
 I found out about Mr. Mahoney? 

959
01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:57.946
           Of course.           

960
01:01:57.948 --> 01:02:01.349
 Okay. So I told you before he  
was married back in New Jersey. 

961
01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:05.554
  Well. he was married before   
 that. Both women died the same 
       way your mom did.        

962
01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:11.226
And they both had lots of cash. 
   So. I really need to find    
        out where he is.        

963
01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:18.233
  Well. that might be a little  
          hard to do.           

964
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:21.036
        And why is that?        

965
01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:27.642
    Well. he's a little bit     
     indisposed. currently.     

966
01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.111
          Indisposed.           

967
01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:40.756
Ah. by any chance does that mean
 that at an earlier time he was 
            expired             

968
01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:44.226
    and potentially in that     
    refrigerator over there?    

969
01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:53.802
 The card that we found. it was 
 your mom's account but it was  
         his card. huh?         

970
01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:59.441
It really was an accident. It's 
   not going to sound like it   
        was but it was.         

971
01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:04.079
     He came in here he was     
 threatening us the whole time. 

972
01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.515
   He knew what I was asking    
   questions about his past.    

973
01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.251
 And then there was this glass. 

974
01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:13.522
          What glass?           

975
01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:16.424
 It's hard to explain. You know 
   he grabbed me and I kicked   
              him.              

976
01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:18.326
   and then he grabbed Ceil.    

977
01:03:18.629 --> 01:03:22.798
 and Ceil had poured this pure  
     nicotine into a glass.     

978
01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.333
     It was eating through      
          a paper cup.          

979
01:03:25.702 --> 01:03:29.137
      He thought there was      
      booze in the glass.       

980
01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:33.942
So what. He drank the nicotine? 

981
01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.978
       Yeah. Now you're         
       getting the idea.        

982
01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:40.482
              Wow.              

983
01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:46.888
     Did he have a weapon       
      on him or anything?       

984
01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:52.294
       No. Well he didn't       
      when we buried him.       

985
01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.564
             What?              

986
01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:58.133
             Ahh...             

987
01:03:58.135 --> 01:04:03.805
 Emily. why didn't you call me? 
  Why did you call the police?  

988
01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:06.141
I don't know. I honestly don't. 

989
01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:09.077
  I mean when he fell over he   
  ripped the phone out of the   
             wall.              

990
01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:12.047
    and Ceils cell phone was    
       in the apartment.        

991
01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:16.318
   Then you called and I just   
  thought I would sound nuts.   

992
01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:22.357
     So I really did kill       
      somebody. didn't I?       

993
01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:28.830
 Um. did you have a gun to his  
           head when            
     he drank the nicotine?     

994
01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.833
       No. Of course not.       

995
01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:40.075
  Then technically you didn't   
kill anybody. Ah. you just kind 
         of... helped.          

996
01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:49.451
Ah. it's probably manslaughter. 
    But um. what I think the    
      prudent thing to do.      

997
01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:54.689
 at this juncture. would be for 
  you to take me to the body.   

998
01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:57.058
 and then we'll go from there.  

999
01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:07.102
    Right. Well. that too.      
      will be a challenge.      

1000
01:05:08.038 --> 01:05:10.939
     I probably shouldn't       
      even ask. should I?       

1001
01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:30.125
   All right. I'll admit it.    
         I'm intrigued.         

1002
01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:33.929
You've never asked me to meet in
 such a clandestine way before. 

1003
01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:37.899
Well. you yourself said that we 
 have not opened the case. yet. 

1004
01:05:38.068 --> 01:05:40.936
       Okay. Now I know         
      what this is about.       

1005
01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:42.003
      I need a big favor.       

1006
01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:45.240
  It's not going to land me in  
        prison. will it?        

1007
01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:46.508
           It might.            

1008
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:49.144
     No. no. I was joking       
       when I said that.        

1009
01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.413
 I was being a little dramatic. 

1010
01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:53.982
   No. you're never dramatic.   

1011
01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:57.185
       What's the favor?        

1012
01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:01.623
  You wouldn't happen to own a  
       snorkel. would ya?       

1013
01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.965
  Are you sure this is a spot?  

1014
01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:12.867
       Yeah. I think so.        

1015
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.971
How did you weigh the body down?

1016
01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.608
        Huh... Alright.         

1017
01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.293
           Detective?           

1018
01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:40.829
             Yeah.              

1019
01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.530
 I think these are really going 
       to help your case.       

1020
01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:47.335
         Thanks. Ceil.          

1021
01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:48.236
             Sure.              

1022
01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:50.705
           Hey guys?            

1023
01:06:50.907 --> 01:06:51.973
             Yeah.              

1024
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:54.809
          What is it?           

1025
01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:11.993
             Oops.              

1026
01:07:14.798 --> 01:07:18.266
 Oh. if it isn't detective Fry. 
      back from the dead.       

1027
01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:19.167
              Huh?              

1028
01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:22.771
      Ah. we know we were       
      early this morning.       

1029
01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:25.206
            You do?             

1030
01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.542
      You shouldn't have.       

1031
01:07:28.845 --> 01:07:30.678
      Shouldn't have what?      

1032
01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:33.448
            Come on.            

1033
01:07:34.951 --> 01:07:35.784
          I. but I...           

1034
01:07:35.786 --> 01:07:36.484
      Look. look at this.       

1035
01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:38.937
           I just....           

1036
01:07:38.938 --> 01:07:41.389
Look at this. I mean. detective 
     Fry. you are the best.     

1037
01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:44.726
No one else remembered that it's
  my 10th anniversary. But you  
              did.              

1038
01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:50.398
 And chocolate cake. That's my  
   favorite. How'd you know?    

1039
01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:53.535
     Ahhh. I'm a detective?     

1040
01:07:57.174 --> 01:07:59.274
    Nice of you to show up.     

1041
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:04.412
   All right. Hennessy. let's   
agree. I definitely owe you one.

1042
01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:07.982
 No. It's all in a day's work.  
       But you do owe me.       

1043
01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.219
        How did it feel         
      doing a day's work?       

1044
01:08:11.888 --> 01:08:15.623
  It was weird. It was like. I  
don't do nice things for people.

1045
01:08:31.074 --> 01:08:32.073
              Ow!               

1046
01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:34.626
           You okay?            

1047
01:08:34.627 --> 01:08:36.077
   Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.    
          Don't worry.          

1048
01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:39.814
 Sorry. I just want you to have 
   everything you need. Okay?   

1049
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:42.016
      I'm really excited        
      about being an aunt.      

1050
01:08:42.619 --> 01:08:45.520
 You're going to be an aunt in  
   prison and my daughter...    

1051
01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:49.190
Hey. lots of famous people were 
  born in prison. Don't worry   
           about it.            

1052
01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.659
   At least you'll have a guy   
  waiting for you when you get  
              out.              

1053
01:08:52.429 --> 01:08:55.363
 We'll see. Hennessy and Bryce  
  are still walking the beat.   

1054
01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:56.931
Bryce isn't too happy about it. 

1055
01:08:56.933 --> 01:09:00.435
 Yeah. but there's no chance in 
   hell he's not going to be    
     here when you get out.     

1056
01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:02.937
 He really threw himself under  
        the bus for you.        

1057
01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:05.140
for the both of us. as a matter 
            of fact.            

1058
01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:07.208
       I'm sure Justin's        
     gonna be there. too.       

1059
01:09:07.744 --> 01:09:09.043
  I'm not too sure about that.  

1060
01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:13.047
 But you know what. there are a 
    lot of really hot babes     
      walking around here.      

1061
01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:14.349
            Ha. ha.             

1062
01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:17.385
   We got another letter from   
            Charles.            

1063
01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:20.355
Really. What did he say? Did he 
     tell you where he was?     

1064
01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.623
       No. of course not.       

1065
01:09:24.227 --> 01:09:27.095
 I sure hope he wasn't serious  
  when he said he was looking   
        for Tim Robbins         

1066
01:09:27.097 --> 01:09:28.530
      and Morgan Freeman.       

1067
01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:31.799
    I just hope he's happy.     

1068
01:09:33.003 --> 01:09:35.703
  What do you think about that  
    sleazy producer's offer?    

1069
01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.605
 I guess if they make it into a 
           good movie           

1070
01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:40.875
   and not one of those after   
school specials. I'm okay. What 
           about you?           

1071
01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:43.811
 I just want a say in casting.  

1072
01:09:44.014 --> 01:09:45.647
  That's not going to happen.   

1073
01:09:46.116 --> 01:09:47.815
   Then they can kiss my ass.

         [loud speaker]         

1075
01:09:53.123 --> 01:09:55.657
       [End Title Music]
