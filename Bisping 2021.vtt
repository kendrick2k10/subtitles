I've had people
write me off constantly.

Constantly throughout my
career. saying I wasn't good

6
00:00:45.262 --> 00:00:48.787

Bisping has
reached his plateau.

They don't know

You forget how much he's
had to sacrifice to get to

Bisping is a fighter.

If you think you're better

beat him?

24
00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:21.211
Bisping's down to find out.

Michael was the youngest

for his older brother.

164
00:07:23.617 --> 00:07:26.446
And Michael would then price
everything he had got for

165
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.623
Christmas and say. "Well. next
year. I want you to spend the

166
00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:31.320
same amount of money on me".

167
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.671

add inflation into it.

If you have any words
to describe Michael.

talking shit. then. then I'm

177
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.001
gonna take care of it." and
that's what I started doing.

178
00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:01.611
you know. and it felt nice.

179
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:04.353
This one guy in particular
was. you know. bullying me.

180
00:08:04.353 --> 00:08:05.354
and I said. "I'm not gonna
fucking take this any more".

181
00:08:05.354 --> 00:08:06.573
You know.

182
00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:08.400
And I punched him in the face.

183
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.793
It was good.

184
00:08:09.793 --> 00:08:11.534
It was rewarding. you know.
because they changed

185
00:08:11.534 --> 00:08:13.536
their tune.

186
00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:14.842
They shut the fuck up.

187
00:08:14.842 --> 00:08:18.193
There's always idiots around.
you know. so getting into

188
00:08:18.193 --> 00:08:19.977
fights when I was younger.
unfortunately when I was

189
00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:21.762
a kid. yeah. there
was a lot of that.

190
00:08:21.762 --> 00:08:24.895
KATHLEEN:
He was always full
of life. full of energy.

191
00:08:24.895 --> 00:08:28.943
He didn't know what he was
gonna do next. and my husband

192
00:08:28.943 --> 00:08:33.730
thought it'd be a good
idea to put that energy into
Jiu-Jitsu

193
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.864
and. you know. a hobby.

194
00:08:36.864 --> 00:08:39.780
JAN:
The culture at the time
said that this guy one day

195
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.479
will be a world champion in
martial arts. and I thought.

196
00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:45.307
"Well. if you see that. then
I'll keep bringing him down

197
00:08:45.307 --> 00:08:47.352
to train".

198
00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:49.093
MICHAEL:
You know. I never
played sports when I was

199
00:08:49.093 --> 00:08:50.530
a kid.

200
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:55.012
When I was at school and we
picked teams. they picked

201
00:08:55.012 --> 00:08:57.580
that guy. that guy.
that guy. that guy.

202
00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.061
There'd be me at the end with
like the disabled kid.

203
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:01.889
and they'd pick the disa...

204
00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:02.585
I'm like. "Come on.

205
00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:03.368
For fuck's sake.

206
00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:04.413
Are you serious?"

207
00:09:04.413 --> 00:09:06.720
So I was never a gifted
athlete at school.

208
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.244
but I could fight.

209
00:09:09.244 --> 00:09:09.810
I mean. I started doing
martial arts when I was

210
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.594
8 years old.

211
00:09:11.594 --> 00:09:15.903
Fighting was something
that I liked. to be honest.

212
00:09:15.903 --> 00:09:18.601
ALLAN:
It was 100% effort or
nothing. and he always

213
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:20.864
gave 100% effort.

214
00:09:20.864 --> 00:09:22.605
He would keep coming for you.

215
00:09:22.605 --> 00:09:26.435
He's take a few shots. and
he's still coming at you. and

216
00:09:26.435 --> 00:09:29.003
get hurt. and still come at
you. because his attitude was

217
00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:31.875
absolutely phenomenal.

218
00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.790
JAN:
Say. when he was 11. was
fighting in the under

219
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.923
13's and winning it.

220
00:09:35.923 --> 00:09:39.535
The under 16's and winning
it. and invariably winning the

221
00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:43.583
under 18's and doing well
in the adult competition.

222
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.803
[♪♪♪]

223
00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:48.718
CHRIS:
His dad. his brothers.
the entire family was

224
00:09:48.718 --> 00:09:49.893
well-known around Clitheroe.

225
00:09:49.893 --> 00:09:50.764
You know what I mean.

226
00:09:50.764 --> 00:09:52.548
You didn't fuck with him.

227
00:09:52.548 --> 00:09:53.505
SHIREEN:
Be careful. because
I've heard that Bispings

228
00:09:53.505 --> 00:09:55.116
are violent.

229
00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:56.900
MICHAEL:
It was a
volatile household.

230
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.860
KATHLEEN:
Well. it was really strict.
because I think of the army.

231
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.863
and he used to shout.
and people all could hear him.

232
00:10:02.863 --> 00:10:03.994
and they used to
say. "Oh my god.

233
00:10:03.994 --> 00:10:05.735
Jan is off again."
wouldn't they.

234
00:10:05.735 --> 00:10:07.302
SHIREEN:
If I ever wanted
anything. I would always

235
00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:08.477
go up. "Dad.

236
00:10:08.477 --> 00:10:09.652
Are you in a good mood?"

237
00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:10.261
He'd be like. "Yeah.

238
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:11.698
Why?"

239
00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:12.437
I'm like. "Well. I wanted
to ask you something".

240
00:10:12.437 --> 00:10:13.613
MICHAEL:
Yeah.

241
00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:14.831
People always say.
"What was your dad like?"

242
00:10:14.831 --> 00:10:15.832
and I'm like. "Well. he was
a bit of a psycho when

243
00:10:15.832 --> 00:10:16.833
he was younger.

244
00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:18.356
He's a calm guy now.

245
00:10:18.356 --> 00:10:21.055
He's very. very calm. in
fact." but when he was

246
00:10:21.055 --> 00:10:24.275
younger. definitely
a bit of a maniac.

247
00:10:24.275 --> 00:10:25.581
Everyone in the neighbourhood.
they were all shit

248
00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:27.235
scared of him.

249
00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:30.412
I remember one time. my
brother was in the school

250
00:10:30.412 --> 00:10:32.588
football team. and it
was Saturday morning.

251
00:10:32.588 --> 00:10:34.503
We went to watch him play. and
we're standing there on the

252
00:10:34.503 --> 00:10:38.725
sidelines. and he fouled
somebody. you know. and the

253
00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:41.553
referee called foul. gave him
a yellow card. and my dad's

254
00:10:41.553 --> 00:10:42.729
like. "What the hell?

255
00:10:42.729 --> 00:10:44.556
What the fuck are you doing?"

256
00:10:44.556 --> 00:10:46.602
And he shouts something out to
the referee. and the referee.

257
00:10:46.602 --> 00:10:48.125
you know. says something
back to my dad.

258
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:49.649
Storms onto the pitch.

259
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:50.650
I'm like. "Jeez. Dad.

260
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.302
What are you doing?

261
00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:52.216
No way".

262
00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:53.435
Boom.

263
00:10:53.435 --> 00:10:55.611
Cheeky little head-butt.
drops the referee.

264
00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:57.004
I'm like. "Dad.
what are you doing?

265
00:10:57.004 --> 00:10:58.614
I'm never gonna live this down.

266
00:10:58.614 --> 00:11:00.442
He walks off. he grabs
me. "Come on. Son.

267
00:11:00.442 --> 00:11:01.704
Let's get in the car.
get out of here".

268
00:11:01.704 --> 00:11:02.705
[laughing]

269
00:11:02.705 --> 00:11:03.619
So yeah.

270
00:11:03.619 --> 00:11:04.272
There you go.

271
00:11:04.272 --> 00:11:06.143
That's what my dad was like.

272
00:11:06.143 --> 00:11:10.670
That's just one of. you know.
many. many instances I can go

273
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.150
to. but you know. as I say.
you know. "I love my dad".

274
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.630
He had a quick temper.

275
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.588
I've got a quick temper.

276
00:11:16.588 --> 00:11:19.679
SHIREEN:
But because of that.
I think. I feel like we all

277
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.507
got the reputation for like
being tough. and I'm not.

278
00:11:22.507 --> 00:11:24.205

MICHAEL:
You know. I never had
a lot of friends and stuff.

280
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.688
but then. when I started
fighting. you know. it kind of

281
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:31.778
makes you more popular. so.
you know. I kind of gravitated

282
00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:34.519
towards that a little bit.
because. you know.

283
00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:35.695
I don't know.

284
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.652
All of a sudden I had
a bunch of friends.

By the way. I'm
talking 16-17-18 years old.

289
00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:49.926
You know. when you're that
age. you don't have any

290
00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:51.275
of the cares.

00:11:51.275 --> 00:11:52.581

Eh!

KATHLEEN:
With his friends
at the time. they would say.

296
00:12:01.372 --> 00:12:03.810
"Michael. this one's
done this to me.

297
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.899
This is. can you sort it out?"

298
00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:07.465
And Michael used to think. "Oh.

299
00:12:07.465 --> 00:12:09.816
I'll sort it out for you."
but he ended up in trouble

300
00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:11.687
then himself.

just typical Michael.

always looks after you.

Growing up. all
people cared about was

304
00:12:17.954 --> 00:12:20.957
football and going to the pub.
and if you combine the two.

305
00:12:20.957 --> 00:12:23.220
the football with the pub and
the drinking and the booze.

beers in the air.

English's passion for football
and you throw in a few beers.

315
00:12:53.207 --> 00:12:54.251

And once again
British soccer supporters

320
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.608
found themselves at the centre
of a shameful display of

321
00:13:03.608 --> 00:13:05.828
running battles. knife
attacks. and sheer

322
00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:07.917

You know. Mike's from a
tough part of the world. that

324
00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:11.921
the further up north you go.
the bigger and meaner

325
00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:13.880
they get.

326
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.664
That's the good thing about
England. I think. personally.

327
00:13:15.664 --> 00:13:19.363
because we don't
have a gun culture.

328
00:13:19.363 --> 00:13:22.105
You're more likely
to just get into a scrap.

329
00:13:22.105 --> 00:13:24.847
There was a problem. you had
a fight. you settled it with

330
00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:28.024
your fists. and that's
the way we did it.

331
00:13:28.024 --> 00:13:29.852

It's funny. 'cause we'd
go. went around Clitheroe

332
00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:34.552
filming for Reebok. and we're
walking down the street going

333
00:13:34.552 --> 00:13:37.120
to this set. and it's only me
and Mike. and he says.

334
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.947
"See that pub there. Daz?"

335
00:13:37.947 --> 00:13:39.296
I said. "Yeah".

336
00:13:39.296 --> 00:13:39.819
He said. "I got
thrown out of there.

337
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.211
See that pub over there?

You see that pub over there?

Well. this happened.

He was just going down the

Anyone that. you know. needs

slaughter house in Clitheroe.

354
00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:10.762
and my fist job was to go
around and pick up all the

00:14:10.762 --> 00:14:13.026

the bin and put the heads in

That's why I was so unhappy.

we'd work Monday to Friday.

"No." and they would hit him.

00:15:11.171 --> 00:15:13.956
and he would always finish it.
but it was defence. and it got

him in trouble.

00:15:28.188 --> 00:15:29.798
And he grabs this girl. and
he grabs her - he's in like

403
00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:34.542
He's stood in the
middle of the road.

He's got this girl grabbed.

You're acting like a tough

As I'm standing here like
this. I can see the other one.

He's getting closer and closer.

He's edging closer. and the
other guy's talking. so he's

got my attention. and the
other guy's edging closer

414
00:15:56.129 --> 00:15:57.869
And I could see him. but he
didn't - I didn't let him know

415
00:15:57.869 --> 00:15:59.088
that I could see him.

416

I was laid in bed. it was summer
so the window was opened.

421
00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:09.316

It was super early.

423
00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:12.667
And I peer out the window.

424
00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:13.798
There was like 3
cops at the door.

Kind of had an idea.

428
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:19.456
And I looked out the door
there at the back. and there

429
00:16:19.456 --> 00:16:21.023
was like 4 cops there as well.

I'm trying to talk to the

"You're under arrest".

It sounds awful. but
it was kind of normal. and

asleep on the couch.

there was no argument and

I felt. it was weird.

mentally process it all.

00:26:23.146 --> 00:26:27.107
which is what we ended up doing.

688
00:26:27.107 --> 00:26:31.067
BRUCE:
Who will be crowned the
Ultimate Fighter and go on to

689
00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:35.071
receive a 6-figure
contract with the UFC.

690
00:26:35.071 --> 00:26:36.899
MIKE:
How is he
still standing?

691
00:26:36.899 --> 00:26:38.031
JOE:
Oh!

692
00:26:38.031 --> 00:26:39.510
MIKE:
Haynes is in trouble.

693
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:40.903
It is all over!

694
00:26:40.903 --> 00:26:42.513
JOE:
Wow.

695
00:26:42.513 --> 00:26:45.647
MIKE:
Michael Bisping
is the Ultimate Fighter.

696
00:26:45.647 --> 00:26:48.128
MICHAEL:
All that time as a kid.
when I was younger. you know.

697
00:26:48.128 --> 00:26:50.783
being a little dickhead.
gettin' in scraps.

698
00:26:50.783 --> 00:26:52.001
it's all paying off now.

699
00:26:52.001 --> 00:26:53.002
REBECCA:
It's worked. you know.

700
00:26:53.002 --> 00:26:55.744
This crazy plan that we had.

701
00:26:55.744 --> 00:26:57.659
A lot of people doubted us.

702
00:26:57.659 --> 00:27:00.619
MICHAEL:
I just remember sprinting up
the stands to Rebecca.

703
00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:04.927
It brought a tear to
my eye. it really did.

704
00:27:04.927 --> 00:27:06.842
MICHAEL:
I had no idea that
the people of Great Britain

705
00:27:06.842 --> 00:27:09.976
were watching and were behind
me the way they were. and I

706
00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:11.847
will never ever forget that.

707
00:27:11.847 --> 00:27:13.762
[♪♪♪]

708
00:27:13.762 --> 00:27:16.330
MICHAEL:
So I dominated Elvis Sinosic
at UFC 70. and I got

709
00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:20.551
the TKO from my first ever
UFC win on English soil.

710
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:24.033
I went on to beat Matt Hamill
in UFC 75 in a very

711
00:27:24.033 --> 00:27:27.515
hard-fought split
decision victory.

712
00:27:27.515 --> 00:27:30.736
I fought Rashad Evans. and
I was kinda just happy to be

713
00:27:30.736 --> 00:27:33.564
there. and unfortunately.
I took my first ever loss

714
00:27:33.564 --> 00:27:35.697
by split decision.

715
00:27:35.697 --> 00:27:37.656
I was kinda in awe of him a
little bit. and I was a fan

716
00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:39.396
of this guy. you know.

717
00:27:39.396 --> 00:27:42.835
So. that was the problem
with my mentality back then.

718
00:27:42.835 --> 00:27:44.837
I'd say. "Ah. well. I'm crying
all the way to the bank."

719
00:27:44.837 --> 00:27:50.756
and I think deep down. that was
just me trying to mask it.

720
00:27:50.756 --> 00:27:53.323
From that moment on. I made
sure I was in the right

721
00:27:53.323 --> 00:27:55.151
mindset for all of my fights.

722
00:27:55.151 --> 00:27:56.892
I fought Charles McCarthy.

723
00:27:56.892 --> 00:28:00.940
First-round TKO.

724
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.725
I then fought Jason Day.

725
00:28:03.725 --> 00:28:06.032
First-round TKO.

726
00:28:06.032 --> 00:28:08.861
I never lost a fight in 2008.
and I thought. "If I could

727
00:28:08.861 --> 00:28:12.691
beat Dan Henderson at UFC 100.
I had to get a title fight".

728
00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:14.301
[♪♪♪]

729
00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:20.002
ARIEL:
I knew how
big that fight was.

730
00:28:20.002 --> 00:28:23.223
It was at the time the
biggest card in UFC history. UFC
100.

731
00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:26.966
DAN:
Prior to UFC 100. Michael
Bisping and I were coaches on

732
00:28:26.966 --> 00:28:29.229
the ultimate fighter. and it
was the first time they did

733
00:28:29.229 --> 00:28:32.798
country verse country.
USA versus UK.

734
00:28:32.798 --> 00:28:35.409
During the show. Michael
talked a lot of smack.

735
00:28:35.409 --> 00:28:36.671
MICHAEL:
Taking it to the yanks.

736
00:28:36.671 --> 00:28:37.890
MICHAEL:
Is that
the best you've got?

737
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.543
MAN:
Look. man...

738
00:28:39.543 --> 00:28:41.197
DAN:
A lot of people weren't
fans of his after that.

739
00:28:41.197 --> 00:28:42.895
KARYN:
Michael was definitely
the "bad guy". definitely the

740
00:28:42.895 --> 00:28:45.680
"bad boy". the smack talker.

741
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.465
I understand why a lot of
people didn't like Michael and

742
00:28:48.465 --> 00:28:50.816
really wanted to see him
get his butt handed to him.

743
00:28:50.816 --> 00:28:52.469
MAN:
Mike. I talk so much shit
to you on Twitter. and you

744
00:28:52.469 --> 00:28:54.428
never blocked me.
and now I'm a fan.

745
00:28:54.428 --> 00:28:56.082
MICHAEL:
You can kiss my ass.

746
00:28:56.082 --> 00:28:58.171
MICHAEL:
The main challenge
this week I suppose is just

747
00:28:58.171 --> 00:29:02.784
making weight and getting into
the octagon nice and healthy.

748
00:29:02.784 --> 00:29:07.310
But it's all gonna go
swimmingly smooth. I'm sure.

749
00:29:11.967 --> 00:29:19.192
[high-pitched tone]

750
00:29:20.802 --> 00:29:28.070
[heavy breathing]

751
00:29:39.342 --> 00:29:41.083
MICHAEL:
I can't
remember anything.

752
00:29:41.083 --> 00:29:42.781
I don't remember
leaving the octagon.

753
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.347
I don't remember anything.

754
00:29:47.046 --> 00:29:48.830
I didn't know what was going on.

755
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:54.009
I had no idea why I was in a
locker room and I just fought.

756
00:29:54.009 --> 00:29:57.796
In my mind. I wasn't-I was
fighting. 3 months' time.

757
00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:01.712
[cheering]

758
00:30:01.712 --> 00:30:03.802
JOE:
He was circling
towards that direction.

759
00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:05.934
He ran right into the big
right hand of Dan Henderson.

760
00:30:05.934 --> 00:30:08.850
He is still out cold.

761
00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:09.503
MICHAEL:
And I'm thinking.
"What do you mean

762
00:30:09.503 --> 00:30:10.286
I just fought?"

763
00:30:10.286 --> 00:30:11.244
They're like. "Yeah. yeah. yeah.

764
00:30:11.244 --> 00:30:12.375
Michael. you got knocked out".

765
00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:13.289
I'm like. "No. no. no.

766
00:30:13.289 --> 00:30:15.074
I'm fighting in 3 months".

767
00:30:15.074 --> 00:30:15.770
They're like. "No. Michael.

768
00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:16.205
You fought tonight".

769
00:30:16.205 --> 00:30:17.816
I'm like. "Hold on.

770
00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:19.034
What. did I step in for
somebody at the last minute?

771
00:30:19.034 --> 00:30:19.774
Did somebody get injured?"

772
00:30:19.774 --> 00:30:20.122
They're like.

773
00:30:20.122 --> 00:30:21.732
"No. Michael.

774
00:30:21.732 --> 00:30:23.256
Right. you need to
go to the hospital".

775
00:30:23.256 --> 00:30:25.780
So. I start having a shower.
and I come out. and my manager

776
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.172
was there.

777
00:30:26.172 --> 00:30:26.781
I say. "Hey.

778
00:30:26.781 --> 00:30:27.086
Come here.

779
00:30:27.086 --> 00:30:28.043
Come here".

780
00:30:28.043 --> 00:30:30.089
I said. "What's going on?"

781
00:30:30.089 --> 00:30:31.438
He said.
"You've been knocked out.

782
00:30:31.438 --> 00:30:32.613
You need to go to the hospital".

783
00:30:32.613 --> 00:30:33.614
I said. "No.

784
00:30:33.614 --> 00:30:33.962
Ah. yeah.

785
00:30:33.962 --> 00:30:35.007
I'm fine.

786
00:30:35.007 --> 00:30:35.703
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine".

787
00:30:35.703 --> 00:30:36.791
Go back into the shower.

788
00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:37.879
30 seconds later.

789
00:30:37.879 --> 00:30:39.315
Cwuh. from out behind the towel.

790
00:30:39.315 --> 00:30:39.707
I'm like. [whispering]
"Come here.

791
00:30:39.707 --> 00:30:41.187
Come here.

792
00:30:41.187 --> 00:30:42.666
What's going on?"

793
00:30:42.666 --> 00:30:44.407
He's like. "You've been
fucking knocked out.

794
00:30:44.407 --> 00:30:45.408
You need to go to the hospital".

795
00:30:45.408 --> 00:30:46.845
I was. "Ah. I'm fine.

796
00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:48.629
I'm fine. I'm fine." and
anyway. that went on a few

797
00:30:48.629 --> 00:30:49.499
times. and like.

798
00:30:49.499 --> 00:30:49.935
"You need.

799
00:30:49.935 --> 00:30:50.936
To go.

800
00:30:50.936 --> 00:30:52.676
To the hospital. okay?"

801
00:30:52.676 --> 00:30:55.549
'cause I didn't have a fucking
clue what was going on.

Yeah.

805
00:31:05.124 --> 00:31:06.821
I was in the back of an
ambulance with Frank Mir.

806
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:08.997
Frank Mir just been fucked up
by Brock Lesnar. and me and

807
00:31:08.997 --> 00:31:11.347
Frank Mir in the back of
an ambulance like two sorry

808
00:31:11.347 --> 00:31:14.785
assholes. and yeah.
then it all started.

809
00:31:14.785 --> 00:31:17.310
I was sitting there.
and I just went. "Fuck".

810
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.876
And he went. "What?

811
00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:18.615
What?"

812
00:31:18.615 --> 00:31:19.312
I said. "Nah".

813
00:31:19.312 --> 00:31:20.704
I said. "Now it makes sense.

814
00:31:20.704 --> 00:31:23.098
Now I remember." 'cause
before I had no idea.

815
00:31:23.098 --> 00:31:25.274
I couldn't put it all
together. and my brain had

816
00:31:25.274 --> 00:31:27.842
finally started working to the
point where I could piece it

817
00:31:27.842 --> 00:31:28.843
all together.

818
00:31:28.843 --> 00:31:29.931
I was like. "Shit.

819
00:31:29.931 --> 00:31:30.976
I lost the fight".

820
00:31:30.976 --> 00:31:31.498
You know.

821
00:31:31.498 --> 00:31:32.194
Oh well.

00:31:32.194 --> 00:31:33.239

824
00:31:41.247 --> 00:31:45.164
MICHAEL W:
Those were two nasty. nasty.
nasty punches.

825
00:31:45.164 --> 00:31:49.603
I mean. that's like the punch
that. you know. when you punch

826
00:31:49.603 --> 00:31:52.911
that damn bag at the carnival.
the thing that registers

827
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:55.043
how hard you punch?

828
00:31:55.043 --> 00:31:56.479
That looks like that punch.

829
00:31:56.479 --> 00:31:58.177
You know. when you just take a-.

830
00:31:58.177 --> 00:32:01.136
If you wind up and give it all.

831
00:32:01.136 --> 00:32:04.357
JOE:
Getting fucked up in a
fight where it was your choice

832
00:32:04.357 --> 00:32:07.969
to enter into the fight.
you decided you're gonna get
into

833
00:32:07.969 --> 00:32:09.797
a cage with another man?

834
00:32:09.797 --> 00:32:12.974
It takes a special kind of
person to choose to do that.

835
00:32:12.974 --> 00:32:16.151
MICHAEL:
I have this mask that
I'm supremely confident and

836
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:20.155
this and that. but that's
probably the opposite.

837
00:32:20.155 --> 00:32:24.246
JOE:
When I see a fighter
lose. especially lose a big

838
00:32:24.246 --> 00:32:27.989
important fight by spectacular
knockout - Like. a perfect

839
00:32:27.989 --> 00:32:31.993
example is when Conor McGregor
knocked out José Aldo.

840
00:32:31.993 --> 00:32:37.564
You knew that the pain that he
was feeling right there

841
00:32:37.564 --> 00:32:40.871
inside the octogan was
just the beginning.

842
00:32:40.871 --> 00:32:47.443
He was going to be
haunted for years.

843
00:32:47.443 --> 00:32:49.097
MICHAEL:
Because when you win
a fight. it's the best feeling

844
00:32:49.097 --> 00:32:52.318
in the world. and then when
you lose. it's horrible.

845
00:32:52.318 --> 00:32:55.321
Of course it hurts physically.
but I don't give a fuck about

846
00:32:55.321 --> 00:32:56.931
physical pain. you know.

847
00:32:56.931 --> 00:33:00.021
That doesn't bother me.
but the emotional pain.

848
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:02.458
the heartache. yeah.
that fuckin' hurts.

849
00:33:02.458 --> 00:33:04.852
You're a failure
in that objective.

850
00:33:04.852 --> 00:33:07.028
You failed. and you told the
world you were gonna win.

851
00:33:07.028 --> 00:33:08.421
you did the press conferences...

852
00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:09.900
MICHAEL:
I'm gonna win.

853
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.078

And you failed.
and you lost.

It's not just the
disappointment of failure.

00:33:32.097 --> 00:33:38.407
It's the rotting pain inside
your soul that this person

858
00:33:39.887 --> 00:33:41.932
took something from you.

859
00:33:41.932 --> 00:33:44.283
Every minute of every day.
whether you're playing with

860
00:33:44.283 --> 00:33:48.069

movies or having dinner with

861
00:33:48.069 --> 00:33:50.289
your wife. in the back of
your head. you're like. "That

862
00:33:50.289 --> 00:33:54.902
mother fucker knocked me out
in front of the whole world".

863
00:33:54.902 --> 00:33:58.210
RASHAD:
The mindset of the
fighter is. is a very

864
00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:01.213
chaotic place.

865
00:34:01.213 --> 00:34:03.215
RASHAD:
Don't you understand?

866
00:34:04.738 --> 00:34:05.521
RASHAD:
What I've been doin'.

867
00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.135

To get in that cage.

TITO:
There's been a lot
of times I've been in my

869
00:34:11.223 --> 00:34:14.965
very darkest points
as a fighter. like no other.

870
00:34:14.965 --> 00:34:19.274
I remember sitting in my hotel
room at Mandalay Bay and just

871
00:34:19.274 --> 00:34:21.711
sitting in the shower. and
just tears coming down

872
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:25.715
my eyes of just... defeat.

873
00:34:25.715 --> 00:34:28.327
Anger.

874
00:34:28.327 --> 00:34:32.113

down. let all my family down.

As a fighter. there
is something that overwhelms

876

00:34:34.898 --> 00:34:36.422

878
00:34:36.422 --> 00:34:37.945
I'll give you an example.

879
00:34:37.945 --> 00:34:40.252
When I played Mike Tyson.
I had to hear everybody's

880
00:34:40.252 --> 00:34:42.471
Mike Tyson story.

881
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:45.257
So you got Robert De Niro
over here. you got former

882
00:34:45.257 --> 00:34:49.522

here. and Mike Tyson walks

883
00:34:49.522 --> 00:34:52.742
in the room. everybody's
gonna look at him.

884
00:34:52.742 --> 00:34:55.963
In a male-dominated society.
the pugilist trumps

885
00:34:55.963 --> 00:34:59.358
everything else. because deep
down people want that power

886
00:34:59.358 --> 00:35:01.403
more than anything else.

887
00:35:01.403 --> 00:35:05.364
The power to dominate another
person. that goes deep into

888
00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:07.540
the psyche of men.

889
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.021
It can be a very lonely.

don't define it as their only

911

MICHAEL:
I just burst into
tears. started bawling my eyes

912
00:36:10.516 --> 00:36:11.691
out. and my wife ran up.

913
00:36:11.691 --> 00:36:12.344
She's like. "What's wrong?

914

What's wrong?"

915
00:36:14.215 --> 00:36:15.434
And it was the first time I'd
released any emotion about

916
00:36:15.434 --> 00:36:16.609

917
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:18.437
Of course I was disappointed.

918
00:36:18.437 --> 00:36:19.220
You know. I thought I was
going to be fighting

919
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.613
for the world title.

920
00:36:20.613 --> 00:36:24.225
I'd sacrificed so much to win
that fight. you know. but as

921
00:36:24.225 --> 00:36:26.575

a joke on the end of it.

and don't relay my emotions.

923
00:36:28.795 --> 00:36:30.884
You know. I always
bottle things up.

924
00:36:30.884 --> 00:36:35.062
And I remember Joe Rogan.
Joe Rogan saying...

925
00:36:35.062 --> 00:36:38.108
JOE:
It takes incredible
mental strength to believe

926

00:36:39.327 --> 00:36:45.942
Do you really wanna do this?

Can you regroup and get
back in to become a

929
00:36:49.294 --> 00:36:50.251
world class fighter?

930
00:36:50.251 --> 00:36:53.602
Some people can't.

And I think that night
a lot of people celebrated the

932
00:36:55.256 --> 00:36:57.693
fact that Michael Bisping was
done. that. that he was

933
00:36:57.693 --> 00:36:59.478
like essentially dead.

934
00:36:59.478 --> 00:37:02.394

just killed him. and killed

935
00:37:02.394 --> 00:37:03.699
him off for good.

936
00:37:03.699 --> 00:37:07.137
We had been rid

You know.
I was. "Fuck him".

938
00:37:07.964 --> 00:37:09.923
I was mad.

939
00:37:09.923 --> 00:37:11.272
I was angry.

940
00:37:11.272 --> 00:37:13.143
I've had people write me
off constantly. constantly

941
00:37:13.143 --> 00:37:15.885
throughout my career. saying
I wasn't good enough.

942
00:37:15.885 --> 00:37:17.365
wasn't strong enough. just
wasn't skilled enough.

943

"It's over.

You're never ever gonna
get a title shot again".

945
00:37:21.717 --> 00:37:23.241
Everybody said. "You cannot
come back from a

946
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:24.894
knockout like that".

947
00:37:24.894 --> 00:37:26.505
Or maybe I should retire.
'cause this isn't good

948
00:37:26.505 --> 00:37:27.636
for my health.

949
00:37:27.636 --> 00:37:29.595
I was like. "Fuck that.

all these people that wrote me

Bisping was all
over Vitor about that.

were definitely guys who

It crept in like
this. and it stopped there.

1111
00:45:02.525 --> 00:45:04.702
it was like the curtains that
had been shut all the way.

1112
00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:07.008
and if I close this eye.
that's all I could see.

1113
00:45:07.008 --> 00:45:10.098
It was all black. and then a
strip of vision in the middle.

1114
00:45:10.098 --> 00:45:13.101

ain't gotta be a doctor to

1115
00:45:13.101 --> 00:45:17.149
figure that that isn't normal.
so I called my eye doctor.

1116
00:45:17.149 --> 00:45:18.411
"I think I've got a
detached retina."

1117
00:45:18.411 --> 00:45:20.674
and he said.
"Well. why do you say that?"

1118
00:45:20.674 --> 00:45:22.502
I said. "Because when I put
my hand in front of my face

1119
00:45:22.502 --> 00:45:24.722
and wiggle my fingers.
I can't fucking see them."

1120
00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:25.940

need to come in here

1121
00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.376

00:45:27.376 --> 00:45:29.030

'Your eye is a mess'".

It was like 90-something.

someone's pressure as high.

this other hospital".

I went to this other hospital.
and they have a procedure

they can clear the drainage

me some medication.

this in your eye. and it'll

They're operating. and I wake
up a little bit beforehand.

Mike Bisping is the true.
he's the true epitome

The life just seemed
to go out of him. and my guess

1228
00:50:50.264 --> 00:50:53.659
is I. he just felt like his
identity was gone as well.

1229
00:50:53.659 --> 00:50:56.879
as well as his
livelihood. you know.

on top of having to go through

imagine what that must have

One thing about

vast difference. but that goes

My doctor wasn't there one
day. and I saw a different

1294
00:53:30.555 --> 00:53:34.733
doctor. and this doctor said.
"My dad told me there's

1295
00:53:34.733 --> 00:53:36.996
two types of people
in this life.

1296
00:53:36.996 --> 00:53:40.217
One type of person. swings
through the jungle on a vine

1297
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:42.436
and waits until they have hold
of another vine before they

1298
00:53:42.436 --> 00:53:44.221
let go of that one".

1299
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:46.092
He said. "The other type
of person swings through the

1300
00:53:46.092 --> 00:53:48.529
fucking jungle and they let
go and they hope

1301
00:53:48.529 --> 00:53:50.705
they catch a vine".

1302
00:53:50.705 --> 00:53:51.315
He said. "Something tells
me you're that

1303
00:53:51.315 --> 00:53:53.273
second type of person".

1304
00:53:53.273 --> 00:53:55.928
I said. "You fucking
bet your ass I am".

1305
00:53:55.928 --> 00:53:57.408
He said. "Okay".

1306
00:53:57.408 --> 00:53:58.887
He said. "We'll start
training. and then we'll see

1307
00:53:58.887 --> 00:54:00.324
how that goes. and then
hopefully down the line

1308
00:54:00.324 --> 00:54:01.890
we'll book a fight".

1309
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.937

the biggest sense of joy

You know. I was so happy.

Having a doctor tell
me to start training again

1323
00:55:06.346 --> 00:55:10.132
and getting medically cleared
to fight. that's two very

1324
00:55:10.132 --> 00:55:11.438
different things.

1325
00:55:11.438 --> 00:55:13.048
I had to pass the test that

1326
00:55:13.048 --> 00:55:17.139
said I had a minimum of
2200 vision. and even though

1327
00:55:17.139 --> 00:55:21.143
2200 vision is classed as
clinically blind. for me.

1328
00:55:21.143 --> 00:55:25.365
well let's just say that
was very challenging.

I know you all wanna know how
I got medically cleared

can't talk about that.

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.592
I'm not going to go into
details. but if you know me.

00:55:34.592 --> 00:55:37.595
then you know there's nothing
I won't do to take care of my

1333
00:55:37.595 --> 00:55:40.598

to do in order to fight again

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.516
That's all I can say.

1336
00:55:45.516 --> 00:55:48.345
But long story short. I got
cleared to fight. but let me

1337
00:55:48.345 --> 00:55:50.651
tell ya. it wasn't easy.

fight after the Belfort fight.

The brain's an amazing
thing. you know.

00:56:32.432 --> 00:56:35.348
Once I actually touch the guy.
once I actually got my hands

1356
00:56:35.348 --> 00:56:38.438
on him. I could physically
touch him. my brain could

1357
00:56:38.438 --> 00:56:40.527
figure out exactly where he
was. and then I'd have more

1358
00:56:40.527 --> 00:56:44.705

an evolution all the time.

your hand over your right eye.

100 would struggle very.

1363
00:56:59.111 --> 00:57:00.634
very badly.

KENNY:
How is this guy
actually going to compete

1366
00:57:11.558 --> 00:57:13.038
with one working eye?

1367
00:57:13.038 --> 00:57:14.387
This guy should be retired.

1368
00:57:14.387 --> 00:57:15.519
What is he doing?

1369
00:57:15.519 --> 00:57:18.478
How is he gonna fight?

1370
00:57:18.478 --> 00:57:20.698
Who does this guy-I mean.
someone needs to tell this guy

1371
00:57:20.698 --> 00:57:22.308
he needs to stop.

1372
00:57:22.308 --> 00:57:23.309
This is ridiculous.

1373
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:25.529
It is difficult
enough with two eyes.

1374
00:57:25.529 --> 00:57:27.095
He's going to do it with one?

1375
00:57:27.095 --> 00:57:30.795
Man. this is. this is insane.

1376
00:57:30.795 --> 00:57:34.407
JOE:
So he has one eye that
looks almost like cross-eyed.

1377
00:57:34.407 --> 00:57:37.236
and it's kinda black. like
he's on ecstasy. like one

1378
00:57:37.236 --> 00:57:38.933
pupil's dilated.

1379
00:57:38.933 --> 00:57:43.242
It's very weird. and
he doesn't give a fuck.

1380
00:57:43.242 --> 00:57:44.417
He's got that one eye fucked
up. and he doesn't give

1381
00:57:44.417 --> 00:57:46.027
a shit.

1382
00:57:46.027 --> 00:57:47.812
He's still going in
there and slinging.

1383
00:57:47.812 --> 00:57:49.466

This is the
main event of the evening.

00:58:13.707 --> 00:58:16.841
JASON:
His eye was a big
part of. of our training.

1387
00:58:16.841 --> 00:58:19.104
And I would test it as
well. because I wanted to know
what

1388
00:58:19.104 --> 00:58:21.585
he was seeing and not seeing.

1389
00:58:21.585 --> 00:58:24.631
Believe me or not. but a
lot of the movement and the

1390
00:58:24.631 --> 00:58:27.808
positioning. to how he
would stand and move. I was
always

1391
00:58:27.808 --> 00:58:31.551
kinda trying to work around
keeping him at an angle where

1392
00:58:31.551 --> 00:58:36.991
his lead was kinda. focusing
on where you're going.

1393
00:58:36.991 --> 00:58:41.126
DAZ:
So he had to compensate
for that by being absolutely

1394
00:58:41.126 --> 00:58:44.433
150% in every other area.
and that's what he went

1395
00:58:44.433 --> 00:58:46.174
and did.

That's the Michael Bisping

1398
00:58:48.437 --> 00:58:50.048
since 2006.

JON:
Look at that.

1400
00:58:50.701 --> 00:58:51.832
Great cardio.

It is all over...

MICHAEL:
Took some time off.
had some problems.

1407
00:58:59.579 --> 00:59:01.363
This is what I'm capable of.

1408
00:59:01.363 --> 00:59:02.974
Believe me. I want
to be world champion.

1409
00:59:02.974 --> 00:59:04.453
I know I have the tools.

1410
00:59:04.453 --> 00:59:06.107
We have to back it up.

1411
00:59:06.107 --> 00:59:07.674
This is the start
of backing it up.

1412
00:59:07.674 --> 00:59:11.722
MICHAEL:
Never ever. ever once
did I contemplate throwing

1413
00:59:11.722 --> 00:59:13.550
the towel in.

1414
00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:17.597
Never once did the thought of
quitting ever cross my mind.

1415
00:59:17.597 --> 00:59:20.165
Never once did I think.
you know. "I could go blind".

1416
00:59:20.165 --> 00:59:22.602
I still had dreams
I wanted to achieve.

1417
00:59:22.602 --> 00:59:24.996
I still wanted to be the world
champion. and I wanted to set

1418
00:59:24.996 --> 00:59:27.651
my family up financially. and
the only way I could do that

1419
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:31.568
was by still fighting. so I
was willing to risk everything

1420
00:59:31.568 --> 00:59:35.310
to. you know. to go and
achieve those goals.

There's an idiot
called Luke Rockhold who

1423
00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.316
doesn't stop talking about me.

00:59:41.316 --> 00:59:43.057
I think he has the hots
for me. to be honest.

1425
00:59:43.057 --> 00:59:44.319

you called me out.

it. let's dance.

Here I am.

1428
00:59:47.496 --> 00:59:50.717
MICHAEL:
Luke and I. we have a
bit of history. and to say

1429
00:59:50.717 --> 00:59:52.589
we don't like each other.
I guess that's a bit

1430
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:53.328
of an understatement.

1431
01:00:00.814 --> 01:00:03.556
MICHAEL:
Luke Rockhold. I'm
sure he's a nice enough guy.

1432
01:00:03.556 --> 01:00:04.818
I don't really know him.

1433
01:00:04.818 --> 01:00:06.211
I can't pretend to know him.

1434
01:00:06.211 --> 01:00:08.169
But what I do know is I
was training for a fight.

1435
01:00:08.169 --> 01:00:10.389
He came down to help me spar.

1436
01:00:10.389 --> 01:00:13.958
My boxing coach.
Jason Parillo. he.

1437
01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:16.090
he was friends with Luke.

1438
01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:17.178
JASON:
People used to ask me
about that sparring session.

1439
01:00:17.178 --> 01:00:18.092
I'm like. "I don't even
talk about it." because

1440
01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:19.790
sparring is sparring.

1441
01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:21.618
Guys get their ass kicked and
kick other guys' asses

1442
01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.489
all the time. you know.

1443
01:00:23.489 --> 01:00:25.839
It's in the gym. and
It is what it is.

1444
01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:26.666
MICHAEL:
I got the better of him.

1445
01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:27.580
I kicked his ass.

1446
01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.799
Whatever you wanna
call it. you know.

1447
01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:29.669
And I was. you know. I was.

1448
01:00:29.669 --> 01:00:30.844
"Ah. Sweet".

1449
01:00:30.844 --> 01:00:32.890
I did a TV show in New York.

1450
01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:35.719
The host of the TV show knew
I'd sparred Luke Rockhold. and

1451
01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:37.938
baring in mind Luke Rockhold
was the Strikeforce champion.

1452
01:00:37.938 --> 01:00:38.896
He wasn't in the UFC.

1453
01:00:38.896 --> 01:00:40.549
He was in Strikeforce.

1454
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:42.987
He was the Strikeforce
champion. and the host said.

1455
01:00:42.987 --> 01:00:44.336
"How did that
sparring match go?"

1456
01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:46.033
I said. "You can't
really talk about sparring.

1457
01:00:46.033 --> 01:00:47.556
Well. let's put it like this.

1458
01:00:47.556 --> 01:00:49.689
I'm the unofficial
Strikeforce champion".

1459
01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:51.691
So. and it was a joke.

1460
01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:52.649
You know.

1461
01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:53.171
It really was just a joke.

1462
01:00:53.171 --> 01:00:54.912
That's my sense of humour.

1463
01:00:54.912 --> 01:00:57.697
And yeah. you know. the little
ego inside me wanted to put it

1464
01:00:57.697 --> 01:00:59.177
out there that I got the
better of him. but it was just

1465
01:00:59.177 --> 01:01:01.266
a sparring match. and
it was just a joke.

1466
01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:04.617
Well. he took offence to it.

1467
01:01:04.617 --> 01:01:06.793
You know. shortly after he was
in the UFC. and he was going

1468
01:01:06.793 --> 01:01:10.754
around talking smack that I'd
said that. and I did say that.

1469
01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:12.756
but it was a joke. and
it was a funny line.

1470
01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.279
It got a laugh from everybody.

1471
01:01:14.279 --> 01:01:19.676

That right there kinda
started the. the I don't like

1472
01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:22.113
you and you don't like me
and we don't like each other.

1473
01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:24.071

He talked so much
trash about us. about England.

1474
01:01:24.071 --> 01:01:25.725
about everything. so-.

1475
01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:28.162
MIESHA:
The thing is is
that fighters have strong

1476
01:01:28.162 --> 01:01:31.426
personalities. and you
can't expect that everybody's
going

1477
01:01:31.426 --> 01:01:33.080
to play nicely and
everybody's gonna get along.

1478
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.779
It's not realistic.

1479
01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:46.964

Okay.

1480
01:01:46.964 --> 01:01:49.227
Here we go.

1484
01:01:52.447 --> 01:01:53.753
I don't.

1485
01:01:53.753 --> 01:01:55.537
I don't give a fuck what
people think about the

1486
01:01:55.537 --> 01:01:58.627
situation and who's the
good guy. who's the bad guy.

1487
01:01:58.627 --> 01:02:01.805
I know who I am.
and I know who he is.

1488
01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:02.936
MICHAEL:
And I remember at the
time we did the show called

1489
01:02:02.936 --> 01:02:05.634
Counterpunch with Jon Anik.
and we didn't like each other

1490
01:02:05.634 --> 01:02:07.898
already. but I'm telling you.
after that. we hated

1491
01:02:07.898 --> 01:02:09.421
each other.

1492
01:02:09.421 --> 01:02:10.639
MICHAEL:
I made an
off-the-cuff remark.

1493
01:02:10.639 --> 01:02:11.423
I was having a laugh.

1494
01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:12.293
Okay?

1495
01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:12.990
LUKE:
It's a tasteless remark.

1496
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:14.339
MICHAEL:
Well. whatever.

1497
01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:14.774
And I'll knock that smug
look off your face. son.

1498
01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:16.907
Believe you me.

I'll knock that weak
little beard off your face too.

MICHAEL:
Oh my God.

1501
01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:21.041
JASON:
I think that's
Rockhold's personality

1502
01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:22.651
to be totally honest.

1503
01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:26.917
I think. I don't know if he's
the most understood guy.

1504
01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:28.788
I don't care who Michael
Bisping's fighting. there's

1505
01:02:28.788 --> 01:02:31.573
gonna be some shit-talking.
and Mike's gonna stir the pot.

1506
01:02:31.573 --> 01:02:33.532
you know. and that's
just the way it is.

The fight was in
Australia. and that's my

1509
01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:44.630
wife's home country. and
when I was walking out to the

1510
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:47.894

felt absolutely electric.

I got head bumped.

1514
01:02:59.558 --> 01:03:00.124
Head bump.

1515

Stop.

Boom.

1520
01:03:06.695 --> 01:03:08.219
He head butted me
and opens the cut.

MICHAEL:
That's the scar.

1522
01:03:09.394 --> 01:03:11.309
That's the cut.
is a big deep cut.

1523
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:13.659
From there the fight was
downhill. all the way.

1524
01:03:13.659 --> 01:03:15.095
as I say.

1525
01:03:15.095 --> 01:03:17.402
Could only just. just see
out a tiny bit if I turned

1526
01:03:17.402 --> 01:03:19.534
a certain way out of this eye.

1527
01:03:19.534 --> 01:03:21.667
Remember. the doctor
only just cleared me.

1528
01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:23.103
This eye.

1529
01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:24.931
This eye. blood was
pumping into it.

1530
01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:25.845
I couldn't see.

1531
01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:26.890
I'd wipe it.

1532
01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:28.761
Everything'd be red.

1533
01:03:28.761 --> 01:03:31.024
I'd blink a few times and
I could see a little bit.

1534
01:03:31.024 --> 01:03:33.679
DAN:
He's been wiping
the blood out of his eye.

1535
01:03:33.679 --> 01:03:35.159
It seems to be bothering
him a little bit.

1536
01:03:35.159 --> 01:03:36.725
JOHN:
Yeah. the Count would
be a little bit worried

1537
01:03:36.725 --> 01:03:37.901
about that.

1538
01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:40.077
Nice combination there.

1539
01:03:40.077 --> 01:03:42.253
LUKE:
There's nothing really
there. and so little by little

1540
01:03:42.253 --> 01:03:44.168
I found his timing.

1541
01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:46.344
DAN:
Oh.

1542
01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:47.867
LUKE:
Came back that second
round and really kinda

1543
01:03:47.867 --> 01:03:50.000
was more aware.

1544
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.784
DAN:
Round number 2.

1545
01:03:51.784 --> 01:03:55.005
The cut on Michael
Bisping's left eye does not look

1546
01:03:55.005 --> 01:03:56.963
like a good one.

1547
01:03:56.963 --> 01:04:00.010
LUKE:
Found my shot right
off the bat. and then started

1548
01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:02.186
working my kicks. and
then I landed that ah-.

1549
01:04:02.186 --> 01:04:03.535
DAN:
Straight left.

1550
01:04:03.535 --> 01:04:04.318
LUKE:
Couple of my.
my specialities.

1551
01:04:04.318 --> 01:04:05.015
DAN:
Front leg.

1552
01:04:05.015 --> 01:04:05.972
Oh... A head kick.

1553
01:04:05.972 --> 01:04:07.017
Bisping's down.

1554
01:04:07.017 --> 01:04:08.801
JOHN:
Good leg kick.

1555
01:04:08.801 --> 01:04:10.803
DAN:
Oh my. could be it...
This could be the finish...

1556
01:04:10.803 --> 01:04:13.197
MICHAEL:
I guess I got kicked
in the head and I didn't know

1557
01:04:13.197 --> 01:04:14.763
what was going on. and next
minute I'm standing there

1558
01:04:14.763 --> 01:04:16.417
and the fight's over.

1559
01:04:16.417 --> 01:04:17.897
DAN:
Takes mount position.

1560
01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:19.029
JOHN:
Luke Rockhold.

1561
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:20.160
DAN:
Wow...

1562
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.858
JOHN:
What a mounted guillotine.

1563
01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:24.338
LUKE:
I knew exactly
what I was gonna do.

1564
01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:26.645
I did exactly what
I was gonna do.

1565
01:04:26.645 --> 01:04:28.908
I told him I was gonna
pick him up off the canvas.

1566
01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:29.778
Said. "You're gonna wake up.

1567
01:04:29.778 --> 01:04:31.258
I'm gonna fuckin'
give you my hand.

1568
01:04:31.258 --> 01:04:32.564
I'm gonna pick you
up off the canvas.

1569
01:04:32.564 --> 01:04:33.782
Dusted him off".

1570
01:04:33.782 --> 01:04:38.265
That's the difference
between me and Michael.

1571
01:04:38.265 --> 01:04:41.007
MICHAEL:
It just hurt inside.
because I knew that wasn't the

1572
01:04:41.007 --> 01:04:44.924
best version of me. but by
saying anything highlighted

1573
01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:48.841
that probably or maybe I
shouldn't have been fighting.

1574
01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:51.583
So yeah. it was a fucked
situation. if I'm honest.

1575
01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:53.411
I'm standing there against a
world-class opponent.

1576
01:04:53.411 --> 01:04:56.022
one of the best to ever do it.

1577
01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:57.110
ARIEL:
And I believe that was
the first time that

1578
01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:58.198
Michael Bisping had ever been
submitted. and that was

1579
01:04:58.198 --> 01:05:00.200
very notable.

1580
01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.637
At the time. I really did
think that that was the end.

1581
01:05:02.637 --> 01:05:04.422
that maybe he would stick
around for a couple more

1582
01:05:04.422 --> 01:05:06.119
fights. but you can't
beat Luke Rockhold.

1583
01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:07.773
How are you ever going to find
yourself back in the

1584
01:05:07.773 --> 01:05:09.427
title picture?

1585
01:05:09.427 --> 01:05:10.819
MICHAEL:
I'll still fight.

1586
01:05:10.819 --> 01:05:11.777
I love doing this.

1587
01:05:11.777 --> 01:05:12.734
Me?

1588
01:05:12.734 --> 01:05:13.822
I'm going nowhere.

[♪♪♪]

1590
01:05:22.222 --> 01:05:24.137
MICHAEL:
It was shortly after
my eye injury. that I remember

1591
01:05:24.137 --> 01:05:28.011
one morning I was running down
here. and I look over. and I

1592
01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:32.972
see the Altarena. and I've had
many fights there. many main

1593
01:05:32.972 --> 01:05:36.628
events. and then when I saw
the arena. that just

1594
01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:38.021
hit home to me.

1595
01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:41.981
I thought. "I'm never
gonna fight there again.

1596
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:42.503
I'm never gonna fight.

1597
01:05:42.503 --> 01:05:44.462
I've got one fucking eye.

1598
01:05:44.462 --> 01:05:47.421
Got one eye. a bad knee.
can hardly run on it.

1599
01:05:47.421 --> 01:05:48.857
And I stopped and. you know.

1600
01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:50.642
Yeah.

1601
01:05:50.642 --> 01:05:53.340
I was crying. I'm almost
crying thinking about it now.

1602
01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.385
[throat clearing]

1603
01:05:55.821 --> 01:05:57.649
[laughing]

1604
01:05:57.649 --> 01:06:00.739
I am fucking crying. but
yeah. no. it was. it was hard.

1605
01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:03.002
It was hard.

1606
01:06:03.002 --> 01:06:03.829
I thought. "I'm done.

1607
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:04.786
I'm over.

1608
01:06:04.786 --> 01:06:05.744
I'm damaged.

1609
01:06:05.744 --> 01:06:06.353
I'm broken.

1610
01:06:06.353 --> 01:06:08.181
Can't do it anymore.

1611
01:06:08.181 --> 01:06:12.055
I did everything I could to
get past those medicals. lied.

1612
01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:15.710
fuckin' conned people. lied
through my fucking teeth.

1613
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:17.190
cheated.

1614
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:18.539
It wasn't for me.

1615
01:06:18.539 --> 01:06:19.453
It was for my family.

1616
01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:21.107
You know what I mean?

1617
01:06:21.107 --> 01:06:24.632
I want to give them everything
I can. and that was only

1618
01:06:24.632 --> 01:06:27.113
through fighting. and giving
up never. never entered

1619
01:06:27.113 --> 01:06:28.288
my mind for a second.

[♪♪♪]

1621
01:06:32.336 --> 01:06:34.077
ARIEL:
I remember there was
one moment in particular where

1622
01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:35.861
he laid out a plan.

1623
01:06:35.861 --> 01:06:37.906
He said. "I'm gonna beat
CB Dolloway. then I'm gonna

1624
01:06:37.906 --> 01:06:40.083
fight this guy. then I'm gonna
fight another guy. and around

1625
01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:42.955
this time next year. I'm
gonna be a UFC middleweight

1626
01:06:42.955 --> 01:06:47.133
champion." and I remember
sitting there. and kind of

1627
01:06:47.133 --> 01:06:51.050
thinking like. "Man. this
is a little bit sad. because

1628
01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:53.096
this is not going to happen.

1629
01:06:53.096 --> 01:06:54.227

going in the right direction

any more.

1631
01:06:55.576 --> 01:06:57.013
You've got the eye issue.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.144
It's just not going well.

So what's
going on right now?

1635
01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:11.549
LUCAS:
Um. um. he set it up
with cookies. and the carrots.

1636
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:14.465
and I'm gonna set up
the milk and beer.

Ah yeah. 'cause he might

1646
01:07:26.216 --> 01:07:27.608
get thirsty.

It was Christmas Eve.

1650
01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:33.310
I got a phone call from
Dana White Christmas Eve.

1651
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:35.007
and I'm. you know.

1652
01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:37.749
Dana's a good guy. but he
doesn't usually call me on

1653
01:07:37.749 --> 01:07:40.621
Christmas Eve to wish me
Merry Christmas. so I see Dana

1654
01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:41.840
on the phone. on the screen.

1655
01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.319

was more to it than that.

take it. but of course I did.

It was beautiful. and I always
wanted to fight that guy.

To fight in London. the
nation's capitol against one

I think the fan base that
Michael has proves it.

Weidman ends up getting

I found out that the fight
was off. and I told

1990
01:19:56.226 --> 01:19:59.229
Michael Bisping that he should
get very vocal. and he should

1991
01:19:59.229 --> 01:20:02.710
probably call the UFC and ask
for this fight before anyone

was even available.

much he wanted it.

So I text Dana

"If none of those pussies can
make it to the octagon.

it. you're next.

01:20:28.998 --> 01:20:30.869
And I thought well. I'm not
getting the fight. because

So I run out in the city.

2036
01:21:31.625 --> 01:21:33.062
I throw my backpack over
my shoulders. and I'm just

2037
01:21:33.062 --> 01:21:38.589
running through the city. and
then Dana calls. and I'm

2038
01:21:38.589 --> 01:21:41.374
on the phone to Dana
while still running.

2039
01:21:41.374 --> 01:21:41.984
DANA:
Bisping would
never say. "No".

2040
01:21:41.984 --> 01:21:43.942
Bisping is a fighter.

2041
01:21:43.942 --> 01:21:47.163
He's. he's... This is what
he was born to do. 'cause

2042
01:21:47.163 --> 01:21:50.253
there's a lot of guys that
try to pull some real stupid

2043
01:21:50.253 --> 01:21:53.038
bullshit when you call and
try to get them to fight last

2044
01:21:53.038 --> 01:21:55.606
minute. and they're actually
real dirty about it.

2045
01:21:55.606 --> 01:21:57.825
Bisping was never
dirty about it.

2046
01:21:57.825 --> 01:22:00.959
Bisping was always smooth in
the way he handled himself.

2047
01:22:00.959 --> 01:22:02.047
MICHAEL:
And as I'm running.
I start thinking.

2048
01:22:02.047 --> 01:22:03.309
"I don't believe this.

2049
01:22:03.309 --> 01:22:06.225
This is so typical of my career.

2050
01:22:06.225 --> 01:22:11.752
I've wanted a title fight my
entire life. and here I am.

2051
01:22:11.752 --> 01:22:16.453
and in true Michael Bisping
fashion. I get it on 2-weeks

2052
01:22:16.453 --> 01:22:19.195
notice against a guy
that already beat me.

2053
01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:21.980
I haven't been near a gym".

2054
01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:24.026
You know. "I had a couple
of drinks last night. and I've

2055
01:22:24.026 --> 01:22:27.681
got- And I've still got to
finish filming 'xXx'

2056
01:22:27.681 --> 01:22:30.206
before I go home. and then
focus on the fight'".

2057
01:22:30.206 --> 01:22:36.081
VIN:
It was preposterous. for
him. to take a fight in

2058
01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:43.349
11 days. with a formidable
fighter. like Luke Rockhold.

2059
01:22:43.349 --> 01:22:47.440
It was a preposterous thought.

2060
01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.052
ARIEL:
And I think Rockhold
kind of hand-picked Bisping

2061
01:22:50.052 --> 01:22:52.315
because he bet him so easily
the first time and felt like.

2062
01:22:52.315 --> 01:22:53.925
"K. 2 1/2 week notice.

2063
01:22:53.925 --> 01:22:55.231
The guy's out there
filming a movie.

2064
01:22:55.231 --> 01:22:56.928
I'm just gonna smoke him again.

2065
01:22:56.928 --> 01:22:58.103
This is great.

2066
01:22:58.103 --> 01:22:59.887
This is a perfect
title defence for me.

01:22:59.887 --> 01:23:01.541
MICHAEL:
I call my
coach. Jason Perillo.

2068
01:23:01.541 --> 01:23:03.891
I'm telling him how I feel.

2069
01:23:03.891 --> 01:23:04.501
He said. "Michael.

2070
01:23:04.501 --> 01:23:05.937
What are you talking about?"

2071
01:23:05.937 --> 01:23:07.330
He said. "You've been training
your entire life

2072
01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:09.462
for this moment".

2073
01:23:09.462 --> 01:23:11.290
He said. "You just beat
the greatest of all time

2074
01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:13.553
in Anderson Silva just a
few months ago".

2075
01:23:13.553 --> 01:23:15.164
He said. "You fight
all the time".

2076
01:23:15.164 --> 01:23:17.514
He said. "The training is done".

2077
01:23:17.514 --> 01:23:19.081
He said. "You're in shape.

2078
01:23:19.081 --> 01:23:20.647
You look after yourself".

2079
01:23:20.647 --> 01:23:22.040
He said. "We can get you
ready in a couple of weeks.

2080
01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.738
but stop having these
negative thoughts".

2081
01:23:24.738 --> 01:23:26.392
He said. "We're gonna
win this fucking fight".

2082
01:23:26.392 --> 01:23:28.873
I thought. "You know. I'm
actually in pretty good shape.

2083
01:23:28.873 --> 01:23:31.963
so yeah.

2084
01:23:31.963 --> 01:23:33.399
Let's do this.

2085
01:23:33.399 --> 01:23:34.922

train. and I wanted to go make

2088
01:23:53.898 --> 01:23:56.944
a big statement. you know.
and it was a big fight

at the time.

It seemed like Rockhold
was loving life as champion.

2094
01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:31.631
I remember him renting
out this mansion.

2095
01:24:31.631 --> 01:24:33.242
It was in California.

2096
01:24:33.242 --> 01:24:36.158
It just seemed like he was
very confident going in to

2097
01:24:36.158 --> 01:24:37.855
that fight. and he had every
right to be confident. because

2098
01:24:37.855 --> 01:24:39.987
he had beaten him not that
long ago in very

2099
01:24:39.987 --> 01:24:41.598
dominant fashion.

I tried to just
completely disrespect him and

2109
01:24:52.957 --> 01:24:55.090
find a way to market this
fight. so I was doing

2110

everything I can. and
obviously being through or

of it. and almost. you know.

01:25:28.079 --> 01:25:31.865
really believed what I was
saying. and kind of forced it

2127
01:25:31.865 --> 01:25:35.042
into my mind that I needed
to do all these things.

If you believe

absolutely no respect for

2202
01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:25.604
Perillo had noticed in a
number of his videos.

2203
01:28:25.604 --> 01:28:27.563
number one. he'll tall.

2204
01:28:27.563 --> 01:28:31.088
Tall people generally tent to
carry their chins quite high.

2205
01:28:31.088 --> 01:28:33.438
and he had this right hand
low. 'cause he's a cocky son

2206
01:28:33.438 --> 01:28:35.353
of a bitch. and then when your
chin's high and your hands are

2207
01:28:35.353 --> 01:28:38.574
low. boom. that left
hand is there all day.

2208
01:28:38.574 --> 01:28:40.184

Referee says.
"You can touch gloves now

2209

2210
01:28:41.054 --> 01:28:41.359
I said. "Hey.

01:28:41.359 --> 01:28:42.186
Come on".

2212
01:28:42.186 --> 01:28:42.621
He says. "No touch".

2213
01:28:42.621 --> 01:28:43.405
I said. "What's that?"

2214
01:28:43.405 --> 01:28:43.666
He says. "No touch".

2215
01:28:43.666 --> 01:28:44.493
I said. "Oh.

01:28:44.493 --> 01:28:45.450
No touch. buddy".

I want you
to fight clean.

2219
01:28:47.234 --> 01:28:47.713

No touch?

01:28:47.713 --> 01:28:48.410
JOHN:
Fight hard.

2221
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.540
You want to touch now?

2222
01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:49.454
Go ahead.

2223
01:28:49.454 --> 01:28:49.628
MICHAEL:
No touch?

2224
01:28:49.628 --> 01:28:50.716
Fuckin' touch?

MICHAEL:
No touch?

2227
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:53.415

Voom. voom. vo-.

JASON:
Try to sneak that
in there a little bit more.

2235
01:29:05.122 --> 01:29:07.733
JOE:
Rockhold has his chin
straight up in the air.

2236
01:29:07.733 --> 01:29:10.214
LUKE:
I just start running
forward and just trying to

2237
01:29:10.214 --> 01:29:12.869
bang. trying. trying
to land shots.

2238
01:29:12.869 --> 01:29:14.610
PAUL:
The more Rockhold throws
those kicks. especially to the

2239
01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:17.917
legs. the less movement we're
gonna see from Bisping.

2240
01:29:17.917 --> 01:29:19.441
and that's his trademark.

2241
01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:20.790
JOE:
He just dug
one into the body.

2242
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:22.052
Michael might be hurt.

2243
01:29:22.052 --> 01:29:22.748

Never really felt it.

2245
01:29:24.097 --> 01:29:25.360
"Oh. That one might've
hurt Bisping".

2246
01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.318
Not really.

2247
01:29:27.318 --> 01:29:28.667
I'm here.

2248
01:29:28.667 --> 01:29:30.234
And I'm looking
for that left hook.

2249
01:29:30.234 --> 01:29:33.411
I'm swinging a couple of
times and they just missed.

2250
01:29:33.411 --> 01:29:36.632
PAUL:
Rockhold has this air of
invincibility mentally

2251
01:29:36.632 --> 01:29:38.764
right now as well.

2252
01:29:38.764 --> 01:29:40.462

The left hook. Michael.

2255
01:29:43.595 --> 01:29:45.205
That's what gonna land.

done in this fight".

01:33:02.402 --> 01:33:05.362
And they offered me a rematch
against Dan Henderson.

2335
01:33:05.362 --> 01:33:07.582
Obviously he knocked
me out at UFC 100.

2336
01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:09.975
He'd fought on the same card
where I'd beat Luke Rockhold.

Dan Henderson".

partial vitreous detachment.

It's where the vitreous shrinks
and separates from the retina.

2515
01:39:54.945 --> 01:39:59.819
which impairs your vision and
can lead to blindness.

New York. was gonna film.

"If you went blind.

thought. "He's right."

01:41:03.448 --> 01:41:06.321
You know. toward the end of
his career. he won the title.

2542
01:41:06.321 --> 01:41:09.628

best. and the thing is. with

01:41:09.628 --> 01:41:11.500
Bisping. he fought the
best his whole career.

2544
01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:14.851
KENNY:
What you do becomes
your identity. and to say.

2545
01:41:14.851 --> 01:41:18.507
"Goodbye." to it means
to say goodbye to your self.

DANA:
Normal human beings like
you and I will never know what

2547
01:41:21.162 --> 01:41:24.904
it's like to walk through a
tunnel. you know. with 20.000

2548
01:41:24.904 --> 01:41:27.298
people cheering you or booing
you or whatever the

2549
01:41:27.298 --> 01:41:29.300
story might be.

2550
01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:31.911
That's a high that we'll never
know and never feel ever in

2551
01:41:31.911 --> 01:41:34.479
our lifetime. and that's what
you were put on this earth

2552
01:41:34.479 --> 01:41:36.177
to do. and now you
have to walk away?

2553
01:41:36.177 --> 01:41:38.222
It's hard.

2562

JOE:
I think Mike stands out
as being. without a doubt.

2563
01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:09.645
one of the most durable and
toughest guys to have ever

2564
01:42:09.645 --> 01:42:11.647
fought inside the octagon.

2565
01:42:11.647 --> 01:42:16.130
MIESHA:
He's a multi-talented
individual. and I think people

2566

Michael Bisping as. as being

VIN:
I've never in my life
heard of a fighter walk into

2569
01:42:30.231 --> 01:42:33.059
a ring in any kind of sport.
let alone the deadliest sport.

2570
01:42:33.059 --> 01:42:33.582
right?

2571
01:42:33.582 --> 01:42:35.888
Mixed Martial Arts.

2572
01:42:35.888 --> 01:42:39.936
With one eye.

2573
01:42:39.936 --> 01:42:41.590
Ever.

2574
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:43.548
If you ask Muhammad Ali.

2575
01:42:43.548 --> 01:42:47.073
If you asked Joe Lewis if a
person could walk in a ring

2576
01:42:47.073 --> 01:42:49.511
with one eye. they'd
say. "You can't".

2577
01:42:49.511 --> 01:42:54.733
But he did. and he won.

2578
01:42:54.733 --> 01:42:55.995
DANA:
Bisping is a fighter.

2579
01:42:55.995 --> 01:42:57.693
Bisping will fight
at the drop of a hat.

2580
01:42:57.693 --> 01:42:59.347
Anybody.

2581
01:42:59.347 --> 01:43:01.523
He doesn't care who you are.
how tough you think you are.

2582
01:43:01.523 --> 01:43:02.915
how tough you really are.

2583
01:43:02.915 --> 01:43:04.917
If you think you're better
than him. you think you

2584
01:43:04.917 --> 01:43:05.744
can beat him?

2585
01:43:05.744 --> 01:43:08.007
Bisping's down to find out.

2586
01:43:08.007 --> 01:43:12.316
MICKEY:
I can beat
Michael Bisping.

2587
01:43:12.316 --> 01:43:14.927
This is the only way I
can beat Michael Bisping.

2589
01:43:16.059 --> 01:43:18.279
Betty Lou.

2590
01:43:18.279 --> 01:43:21.717
It's easy to have a friend
like that. because I have

2591
01:43:21.717 --> 01:43:25.764
so much. so much
respect for the man.

2592
01:43:25.764 --> 01:43:26.896
JASON:
Calls me up to be on a
radio show. and he starts it

2593
01:43:26.896 --> 01:43:29.464
off to thank me.

2594
01:43:29.464 --> 01:43:34.469
I could cry right now thinking
about it. because. as a coach.

2595
01:43:34.469 --> 01:43:37.907
when the athletes remember
what the fuck you told them.

2596
01:43:37.907 --> 01:43:39.996
when athletes remember
what you do for them?

2597
01:43:39.996 --> 01:43:42.999
It's a different animal.
because I did cry.

2598
01:43:42.999 --> 01:43:44.130
I cried in the
phone right there.

2599
01:43:44.130 --> 01:43:45.262
I couldn't even talk.

2600
01:43:45.262 --> 01:43:46.437
I was. like I said.
I could cry right now.

2601
01:43:46.437 --> 01:43:49.614
Michael Bisping doesn't forget.

2602
01:43:49.614 --> 01:43:52.791
DAZ:
Everything that he does.
everything. is for that family

2603
01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:54.663
and them kids and his missus.

2604
01:43:54.663 --> 01:43:56.491
He's not some. some gangster.

2605
01:43:56.491 --> 01:43:59.320
He's not some. some knucklehead.

2606
01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:03.976
He's a family man that
dreampt a dream and lived it.

MICHAEL:
You know. this has
changed my life in such a way

2610
01:44:13.682 --> 01:44:16.946
you will never believe. you
know. but my dream was always

2611
01:44:16.946 --> 01:44:20.689
giving a better life
to my family. okay?

2612
01:44:20.689 --> 01:44:22.604
And that's all I ever wanted.

2613
01:44:22.604 --> 01:44:24.432
CALLUM:
I'm really. really
appreciative. so I would say.

2614
01:44:24.432 --> 01:44:25.824
"Thank you".

2615
01:44:25.824 --> 01:44:27.435
Just sacrificing his
health. you know.

2616
01:44:27.435 --> 01:44:28.262
Everything.

2617
01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:29.175
So.

2618
01:44:29.175 --> 01:44:31.177
Just thank you.

2619
01:44:31.177 --> 01:44:33.789
REBECCA:
For the love that he
has for me and for the kids.

2620
01:44:33.789 --> 01:44:40.665
that's his only
motivation in life.

2621
01:44:40.665 --> 01:44:41.971
MICHAEL:
I must've been 10
years old. "I'm gonna

2622
01:44:41.971 --> 01:44:43.581
be champion of the
world one day".

2623
01:44:43.581 --> 01:44:45.627
But that always stuck with
me. you know. always kept me

2624
01:44:45.627 --> 01:44:47.890
pushing on and working hard.

2625
01:44:47.890 --> 01:44:49.457
So many ups and downs.
peaks and valleys.

2626
01:44:49.457 --> 01:44:52.895
Beyond satisfying. but more
for my family. you know.

2627
01:44:52.895 --> 01:44:55.201
'cause as I said. "They'd
sacrificed with me".

2628
01:44:55.201 --> 01:44:57.291
For me. the sacrifice was
easy. because I'm chasing

2629
01:44:57.291 --> 01:44:59.118
my dream.

2630
01:44:59.118 --> 01:45:01.469
To support me. and go through
the ups and downs with me.

2631
01:45:01.469 --> 01:45:04.080
