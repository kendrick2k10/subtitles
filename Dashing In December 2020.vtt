- Oh. honey. it's just
so nice to have you home.

174
00:07:41.827 --> 00:07:43.620
- Oh. sh--
- [laughs]

175
00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:45.827
- All right.
- Uh-oh.

176
00:07:45.896 --> 00:07:47.965
- Not much has changed
around here.

177
00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:51.758
It still smells like
horse crap and pine cones.

178
00:07:51.827 --> 00:07:54.068
Who's that over
by the carriage?

179
00:07:54.137 --> 00:07:55.551
- Oh. that's Heath.

180
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.517
He's been working on the ranch
for a few years.

181
00:07:57.586 --> 00:07:58.896
He and Blake
are thick as thieves.

182
00:07:58.965 --> 00:08:01.172
- Oh. really?
Traitor.

183
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:03.137
- Well. everybody in town
just adores him.

184
00:08:03.206 --> 00:08:04.827
And he's kept the place going.
- Going?

185
00:08:04.896 --> 00:08:07.034
Going?
What's going around here?

186
00:08:07.103 --> 00:08:10.793
Didn't seem like Hank
is very good at his job.

187
00:08:10.862 --> 00:08:12.655
- Well. you know.
it's still early

188
00:08:12.724 --> 00:08:14.931
and we haven't had a lot
of snowfall this December.

189
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.172
- Sure. yeah.
That's it.

190
00:08:18.241 --> 00:08:20.931
- All right. so why did you
really come home?

191
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.137
Did you come home
for Christmas.

192
00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:24.000
or did you come home
to check on me?

193
00:08:24.068 --> 00:08:26.137
- Do you mind if we talk about
this after I have a shower

194
00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:27.655
over some dinner?

195
00:08:27.724 --> 00:08:29.103
I stink.
- All right.

196
00:08:29.172 --> 00:08:30.896
Well. leave your fancy shoes
out here

197
00:08:30.965 --> 00:08:32.655
and I'll hose them off.

198
00:08:32.724 --> 00:08:34.620
And try to relax!
You're home.

199
00:08:34.688 --> 00:08:37.206
- Okay. okay.

200
00:08:37.275 --> 00:08:40.379
[melancholic music]

201
00:08:40.448 --> 00:08:42.482
- Hey. what'd you bring me?
- Hey.

202
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:46.034
It's a cranberry kale salad.
- Mmm. looks like Christmas.

203
00:08:46.102 --> 00:08:48.275
- [chuckles]
That's what I was going for.

204
00:08:48.344 --> 00:08:51.068
Hey. did Wyatt make it in okay?
- I guess.

205
00:08:51.136 --> 00:08:53.688
Uh. I was out on
the sleigh ride all afternoon.

206
00:08:53.758 --> 00:08:55.172
and then I fed the horses.
showered.

207
00:08:55.241 --> 00:08:57.896
so I haven't been up
to the ranch house yet.

208
00:08:57.965 --> 00:09:00.517
- Wait. so you haven't
met him yet?

209
00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:02.655
Ooh.
[chuckles]

210
00:09:02.724 --> 00:09:04.517
It's gonna be good.

211
00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:06.275
- No. don't tell me.

212
00:09:06.344 --> 00:09:09.344
Is he one of those guys who
makes little homophobic jokes

213
00:09:09.413 --> 00:09:11.896
without knowing
it makes them look homophobic?

214
00:09:11.965 --> 00:09:13.827
Is he?
'Cause that's awkward.

215
00:09:13.896 --> 00:09:16.862
- Um. no.
Not really.

216
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.206
- So you think we'll get along?

217
00:09:19.275 --> 00:09:21.413
- I think I'm here for it
either way.

218
00:09:21.482 --> 00:09:23.275
Come on.
- All right.

219
00:09:27.137 --> 00:09:29.172
- Hi. Deb.
Brought a salad.

220
00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:31.965
- Oh. thank you. Blake.
- And I brought wine.

221
00:09:32.034 --> 00:09:34.758
- So sweet.
- Where's Wyatt?

222
00:09:34.827 --> 00:09:36.310
- He's just grabbing
a quick shower.

223
00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:37.827
- Washing off the stink
of the city?

224
00:09:37.896 --> 00:09:39.551
[both laugh]
- Nope.

225
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.241
Just some good.
ol' horse manure.

226
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.586
- Ah. Sugar Cube!
- Snow Pea!

227
00:09:43.655 --> 00:09:46.965
Oh. look at you.
- Hi. Thanks.

228
00:09:47.034 --> 00:09:49.689
- Right. 'cause Nutmeg
loves snow peas

229
00:09:49.758 --> 00:09:52.034
and Dasher loves sugar cubes.

230
00:09:52.103 --> 00:09:54.241
Dasher used to be your horse.
- Used to be?

231
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.068
He still is.
- Does he know that?

232
00:09:57.137 --> 00:09:59.172
- [forced laughter]
So tell me everything.

233
00:09:59.241 --> 00:10:00.241
What's new?
What's going on?

234
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.551
How is Sam?

235
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.862
Is he still
with Doctors Without Borders?

236
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:06.344
- Mm-hmm. he is.
I'm fine. Sam's fine.

237
00:10:06.413 --> 00:10:08.206
- And where is
ol' Dr. Berry anyhow?

238
00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:09.724
- Oh. he's still
in South Africa.

239
00:10:09.793 --> 00:10:11.068
- [groans]
- Yeah.

240
00:10:11.137 --> 00:10:12.655
I was hoping he'd
make it back for Christmas.

241
00:10:12.724 --> 00:10:14.310
but it's not looking so good.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

242
00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:17.241
That's a bummer.
And you must be Hank.

243
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.034
- Heath.
- Heath. Heath.

244
00:10:19.103 --> 00:10:21.172
I don't know why I wanna keep
calling you Hank.

245
00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:23.413
I hope you don't mind
if I mess it up sometimes.

246
00:10:23.482 --> 00:10:26.482
- If you do that.
can I call you Sugar Cube?

247
00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:27.827
[laughter]

248
00:10:27.896 --> 00:10:30.172
- I will work on
getting it right next time.

249
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:32.413
So Mom. can I help you
with anything?

250
00:10:32.482 --> 00:10:34.172
Oh. you remembered my favorite.

251
00:10:34.241 --> 00:10:35.586
spiced maple
walnut cheesecake--

252
00:10:35.655 --> 00:10:38.137
- Ah. ah. ah. you can have
as much as you want to

253
00:10:38.206 --> 00:10:39.448
after dinner.

254
00:10:39.517 --> 00:10:40.896
- Great. I'll set the table.
- Oh. no. no.

255
00:10:40.965 --> 00:10:42.344
You sit down.
I'll take care of it.

256
00:10:42.413 --> 00:10:44.172
Do you want me
to open this bottle?

257
00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:46.000
Oh. this is actually terrible.

258
00:10:46.068 --> 00:10:48.034
You literally
cannot drink this.

259
00:10:48.103 --> 00:10:51.034
- Yeah. I brought
the terrible wine.

260
00:10:51.103 --> 00:10:52.241
- Oh.

261
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.275
No. I didn't. um...
[clears throat]

262
00:10:55.344 --> 00:10:57.068
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

263
00:10:57.137 --> 00:10:59.517
This is thick sheepskin.

264
00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:01.931
- [forced laughter]

265
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.620
- He got horse manure
on his fancy shoes

266
00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:07.758
and I think he might be
a little bit cranky.

267
00:11:07.827 --> 00:11:10.103
Let's have dinner.

268
00:11:10.172 --> 00:11:12.827
The wine's good. son.
- Hmm. glad you like it.

269
00:11:12.896 --> 00:11:14.896
Hugh had it sent special
just for you.

270
00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:16.206
- Wow.

271
00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:19.241
So how is that
promotion coming?

272
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.068
- I'm actually in the middle of
this really exciting proposal

273
00:11:22.137 --> 00:11:23.827
for a western expansion.

274
00:11:23.896 --> 00:11:26.310
I've got this angel investor
in Denver who's really into it.

275
00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:27.793
- And what is it you do. Wyatt?

276
00:11:27.862 --> 00:11:29.413
- Financial planning
and venture capital.

277
00:11:29.482 --> 00:11:31.793
- He's a VP
of financial planning

278
00:11:31.862 --> 00:11:34.482
who's well-known for
bringing in angel investors.

279
00:11:34.551 --> 00:11:37.482
which is why it's hard for him
to get home.

280
00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:39.586
- Yeah. this is the
first Christmas we've seen you

281
00:11:39.655 --> 00:11:41.793
in. what. five years?

282
00:11:41.862 --> 00:11:43.620
- Maybe I just wanted
to get you to miss me.

283
00:11:43.689 --> 00:11:46.000
- Oh. is that gonna be your
excuse with Dasher tomorrow

284
00:11:46.068 --> 00:11:47.517
when you say hello to him?

285
00:11:47.586 --> 00:11:49.517
- Actually. I was thinking
about just walking right in

286
00:11:49.586 --> 00:11:51.103
with a sugar cube
peace offering.

287
00:11:51.172 --> 00:11:53.620
- Mm-hmm. well. I hope
it comes with an apology.

288
00:11:53.689 --> 00:11:55.206
- [chuckles]

289
00:11:55.275 --> 00:11:58.931
- I also noticed that
stunning mare outside today.

290
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.758
I didn't know you got yourself
a new draft. Mom.

291
00:12:00.827 --> 00:12:03.689
It must've cost a pretty penny.
- Snowbelle's mine.

292
00:12:03.758 --> 00:12:07.000
I brought her with me
when we moved onto the ranch.

293
00:12:09.689 --> 00:12:11.482
- You live here too?

294
00:12:11.551 --> 00:12:13.482
- Heath moved into
the stable house last year.

295
00:12:13.551 --> 00:12:15.310
He fixed everything up.
He redid the plumbing.

296
00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:18.965
he helps me out with Nutmeg
and down at the vet clinic.

297
00:12:19.034 --> 00:12:21.965
- Wow. a regular
jack-of-all-trades.

298
00:12:22.034 --> 00:12:24.034
- Yeah. venture capital's
up next.

299
00:12:24.103 --> 00:12:26.482
Better watch out.
[laughter]

300
00:12:26.551 --> 00:12:29.931
- Heath has been
a real blessing on the ranch

301
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.724
since Carlos retired.

302
00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:33.620
- Well. we love
being here too.

303
00:12:33.689 --> 00:12:35.275
especially Snow.

304
00:12:35.344 --> 00:12:38.827
She and Dasher are
fairly inseparable.

305
00:12:38.896 --> 00:12:40.310
They're very much in love.
you know?

306
00:12:40.379 --> 00:12:42.793
- They're in love.
Did they tell you that?

307
00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:45.344
- Well. it's true. Wyatt.
[chuckles]

308
00:12:45.413 --> 00:12:47.241
Snowbelle freaked out
the other day

309
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.896
when we were
giving Dash his shot.

310
00:12:48.965 --> 00:12:51.137
She's completely out of control
and overprotective.

311
00:12:51.206 --> 00:12:52.413
It's something to see.

312
00:12:52.482 --> 00:12:54.068
- And he follows her
everywhere she goes.

313
00:12:54.137 --> 00:12:56.379
It's really the cutest thing.

314
00:12:56.448 --> 00:12:58.862
It's like a true equine
romance on the ranch.

315
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:01.241
I mean.
Christmas carriage riders

316
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.448
just eat it up on the ranch.

317
00:13:03.517 --> 00:13:05.137
- I'm just surprised
that Dasher isn't too old

318
00:13:05.206 --> 00:13:07.103
to carry that sleigh anymore.

319
00:13:07.172 --> 00:13:08.448
- Oh. he's just 15.

320
00:13:08.517 --> 00:13:11.103
And you know Dash lives
for the ride.

321
00:13:11.172 --> 00:13:12.413
- Yeah. I wouldn't worry
too much.

322
00:13:12.482 --> 00:13:14.068
I mean. Dash is a work horse.

323
00:13:14.137 --> 00:13:16.896
He's got. like. a good one
or two years left in him still.

324
00:13:16.965 --> 00:13:19.620
- And a lot more than some
of our woodland critters do.

325
00:13:19.689 --> 00:13:21.586
The gingerbreads
are on their last leg. Deb.

326
00:13:21.655 --> 00:13:23.344
I mean. another storm
and they won't make it.

327
00:13:23.413 --> 00:13:26.482
so we might...

328
00:13:26.551 --> 00:13:28.448
- Oh. no.

329
00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:32.413
Well. maybe we could think
about getting some new ones.

330
00:13:32.482 --> 00:13:34.758
- Or we could think about just

331
00:13:34.827 --> 00:13:38.172
retiring the carriage ride
altogether.

332
00:13:38.241 --> 00:13:40.517
Hmm?

333
00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:43.275
What?
- Wyatt.

334
00:13:43.344 --> 00:13:45.206
Why would you say that?

335
00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:47.724
- Uh...

336
00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:50.482
This ranch is
prime real estate today.

337
00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:54.655
Maybe it's time we think
about finally selling it.

338
00:13:54.724 --> 00:13:58.482
- You think that we should
sell the family ranch?

339
00:13:58.551 --> 00:14:01.620
The home that you grew up in?
- Oh. come on. Mom.

340
00:14:01.689 --> 00:14:03.206
Don't say it like that.

341
00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:05.000
You know that you can't

00:22:01.758 --> 00:22:03.724
and the property taxes
on the ranch

516
00:22:03.793 --> 00:22:06.206
over three years ago now.

517
00:22:06.275 --> 00:22:08.034
- I'm sorry. are you telling me

518
00:22:08.103 --> 00:22:10.137
that Wyatt is the one
keeping us afloat?

519
00:22:10.206 --> 00:22:11.620
- Uh-huh.

520
00:22:11.689 --> 00:22:15.586
He's paying your salary
every month. my vet visits.

521
00:22:15.655 --> 00:22:19.551
not to mention Deb's
ever-growing pile of bills.

522
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.241
- I just...
[scoffs]

523
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.034
I can't believe
I didn't realize it.

524
00:22:23.103 --> 00:22:25.310
I mean. yeah.
it makes sense now.

525
00:22:25.379 --> 00:22:28.206
Of course.
- Hey.

526
00:22:28.275 --> 00:22:29.827
Wyatt didn't want Deb
to throw away

527
00:22:29.896 --> 00:22:31.482
her entire retirement
on the ranch.

528
00:22:31.551 --> 00:22:34.896
so he took over the payments.

529
00:22:34.965 --> 00:22:36.655
He does care.

530
00:22:36.724 --> 00:22:39.862
Even if he is a Scrooge.
- Well. fine.

531
00:22:39.931 --> 00:22:42.103
But it doesn't change the fact
that he's trying to destroy

532
00:22:42.172 --> 00:22:45.931
the one thing his family
worked so hard to build.

533
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Doesn't he know how much
it's gonna crush his mother?

534
00:22:48.068 --> 00:22:49.517
- Yeah. I think
he just believes

535
00:22:49.586 --> 00:22:51.448
he's doing what's best for her.
you know?

536
00:22:51.517 --> 00:22:53.724
- Yeah. yeah. 'cause he thinks
he knows everything.

537
00:22:53.793 --> 00:22:55.379
Everything.
- [chuckles]

538
00:22:55.448 --> 00:22:58.758
- He can't just roll into town
'cause he's this rich city kid

539
00:22:58.827 --> 00:23:01.586
now and start
calling the shots.

540
00:23:01.655 --> 00:23:04.310
I'm not gonna let him.

541
00:23:04.379 --> 00:23:07.344
- What are you
gonna do about it?

542
00:23:07.413 --> 00:23:09.413
- I'll prove him wrong.
- [chuckles]

543
00:23:09.482 --> 00:23:11.206
- Yeah.
[gasps]

544
00:23:11.275 --> 00:23:14.965
Oh. look.

545
00:23:15.034 --> 00:23:18.689
Aren't these just lovely?
- [sighs]

546
00:23:18.758 --> 00:23:21.344
- Look.
- Yeah.

547
00:23:29.068 --> 00:23:30.137
- [sighs]

548
00:23:30.206 --> 00:23:33.206
[kettle whistling]

549
00:23:40.896 --> 00:23:42.413
- Stables don't have
their own stove?

550
00:23:42.482 --> 00:23:44.137
- [groans]
- Oh. sorry.

551
00:23:44.206 --> 00:23:45.931
[stammers. sighs]

552
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.344
I didn't mean
to actually scare you.

553
00:23:47.413 --> 00:23:49.137
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

554
00:23:49.206 --> 00:23:51.000
I'll just go back to
the stable house where I belong

555
00:23:51.068 --> 00:23:52.310
and put this under
some ice water.

556
00:23:52.379 --> 00:23:55.068
- I said I'm sorry.
Can I take a look?

557
00:23:55.137 --> 00:23:57.655
- I brought your mom
an arrangement from town.

558
00:23:57.724 --> 00:24:00.172
And I was gonna sit out
by the tree with some tea

559
00:24:00.241 --> 00:24:02.034
because I don't have a tree
at the stable house.

560
00:24:02.103 --> 00:24:04.551
- It's gotta be
cool or lukewarm.

561
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.827
It can't be ice water.

562
00:24:05.896 --> 00:24:07.551
Will you follow me
to the sink. please?

563
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.482
[chuckles]

564
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:12.379
- What. you have
a medical degree as well?

565
00:24:12.448 --> 00:24:15.034
- Just put it under there
for a minute.

566
00:24:15.103 --> 00:24:17.689
And no. I don't.
but I did pick up a few things

567
00:24:17.758 --> 00:24:20.448
from Blake's dad
back in the day.

568
00:24:20.517 --> 00:24:23.103
He's a doctor. you know?
- Of course.

569
00:24:23.172 --> 00:24:26.344
Everyone in town goes to him.
He's great.

570
00:24:26.413 --> 00:24:28.241
I'm not sure why he'd let
his daughter date someone

571
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.862
as difficult as you.

572
00:24:29.931 --> 00:24:32.137
- You really think I'm awful.
don't you?

573
00:24:32.206 --> 00:24:36.103
- I think you're in dire need
of some Christmas spirit.

574
00:24:36.172 --> 00:24:38.586
That's for sure.
- Hmm.

575
00:24:38.655 --> 00:24:41.448
[chuckles]

576
00:24:41.517 --> 00:24:44.241
You're not wrong.

577
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.758
I guess--

578
00:24:45.827 --> 00:24:49.517
I guess I am a hard sell
when it comes to Christmas.

579
00:24:49.586 --> 00:24:53.241
They just play that
terrible music for so long.

580
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.413
And after a while. the lights
becoming blinding and--

581
00:24:56.482 --> 00:24:57.862
and in the end.

582
00:24:57.931 --> 00:24:59.689
all the holiday's
really managed to do

583
00:24:59.758 --> 00:25:03.000
is remind you of everything
you wish you had. but don't.

584
00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:06.068
- Wow. yeah.
what's your big holiday wish?

585
00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:08.034
A house in Cape Cod?

586
00:25:08.103 --> 00:25:10.275
Your very own jet plane?
- [laughs]

587
00:25:10.344 --> 00:25:12.862
Now you sound a lot more
like my ex. Lindsey. than me.

588
00:25:12.931 --> 00:25:15.000
- "Lindsey."

589
00:25:15.068 --> 00:25:17.068
Wow. what a lucky woman.

590
00:25:17.137 --> 00:25:19.793
- Luck--man.

591
00:25:19.862 --> 00:25:22.000
A lucky man.

592
00:25:22.068 --> 00:25:25.172
Lindsey's a man
with facial hair like you.

593
00:25:25.241 --> 00:25:27.827
- [scoffs]

594
00:25:27.896 --> 00:25:29.965
You're gay?

595
00:25:30.034 --> 00:25:33.241
- You sound so surprised.

596
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.689
- But you dated Blake
all through school.

597
00:25:35.758 --> 00:25:37.965
- Yeah. I was confused
in high school.

598
00:25:38.034 --> 00:25:40.103
I--I didn't know who I was.

599
00:25:40.172 --> 00:25:42.000
I knew that I loved Blake.

600
00:25:42.068 --> 00:25:44.241
but I think I also knew
that deep down.

601
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:49.137
the relationship
had a shelf life.

602
00:25:49.206 --> 00:25:53.137
- So when did you
finally come out?

603
00:25:53.206 --> 00:25:56.965
- Around the same time
that I broke up with Blake.

604
00:25:57.034 --> 00:26:00.103
I was moving to New York.
I just graduated.

605
00:26:00.172 --> 00:26:02.931
It wasn't easy growing up here.

606
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.689
Colorado clearly
has its...charms.

607
00:26:07.758 --> 00:26:10.482
But it also has
its difficulties.

608
00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:12.965
especially when it comes
to small towns and locals.

609
00:26:13.034 --> 00:26:14.827
- Oh. yeah.
Don't I know it.

610
00:26:14.896 --> 00:26:17.137
- You out around here too?
Sorry.

611
00:26:17.206 --> 00:26:18.862
I didn't mean to just assume
that you were gay.

612
00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:22.482
It's just--well.
my mom told me and. um...

613
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:24.655
[both laugh]

614
00:26:24.724 --> 00:26:27.655
Well. your eyes don't lie.
- What?

615
00:26:27.724 --> 00:26:29.068
I didn't check you out
or anything.

616
00:26:29.137 --> 00:26:32.689
- I didn't say you did.
I'm just saying that. uh.

617
00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:36.034
when you know. you know.

618
00:26:36.103 --> 00:26:38.482
- Yeah. well. I guess
I should've known about you too

619
00:26:38.551 --> 00:26:40.551
because if you're not
that into Blake--

620
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.517
- "Well.
then you must love men."

621
00:26:42.586 --> 00:26:44.137
[laughs]
- Yeah.

622
00:26:44.206 --> 00:26:45.344
- That should be good.
Here.

623
00:26:45.413 --> 00:26:48.000
Why don't you wrap it in this?

624
00:26:48.068 --> 00:26:50.551
[gentle music]

625
00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.172
- Yeah. it's--thank you.

626
00:26:53.241 --> 00:26:55.034
- Good to go.

627
00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:02.931
How about that tea?

628
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.482
- Okay.

629
00:27:08.413 --> 00:27:10.068
Thank you for this.

630
00:27:10.137 --> 00:27:12.517
- Well. thank you
for taking care of my mom

631
00:27:12.586 --> 00:27:13.931
and this whole place.

632
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.068
She seems to really
appreciate you.

633
00:27:16.137 --> 00:27:19.448
- Yeah. well. I really
appreciate your mom.

634
00:27:19.517 --> 00:27:21.241
And I love this place.

635
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.931
Never really feels like work.

636
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.655
- Why is that?

637
00:27:25.724 --> 00:27:28.689
The ranch?
Why do you love it so much?

638
00:27:31.655 --> 00:27:33.551
- [stammers]

639
00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.965
When I was 12 years old.

640
00:27:36.034 --> 00:27:40.931
my dad took off with some woman
he'd met at a work conference.

641
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.931
I didn't really understand
what that meant at the time.

642
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.827
but I do remember
it was summer.

643
00:27:47.896 --> 00:27:51.068
and the vacations
we used to take as a family

644
00:27:51.137 --> 00:27:54.103
suddenly stopped.

645
00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:58.103
And my mom.
well. she cried a lot.

646
00:27:58.172 --> 00:28:00.862
I remember her crying
from her room at night.

647
00:28:00.931 --> 00:28:04.862
even after she thought
I'd fallen asleep.

648
00:28:04.931 --> 00:28:07.172
After a few months.
it wasn't every night anymore.

649
00:28:07.241 --> 00:28:09.931
but every other day.

650
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.448
it would happen again.

651
00:28:12.517 --> 00:28:15.137
And I knew she wasn't
any better.

652
00:28:15.206 --> 00:28:17.586
And then. Christmastime came.

653
00:28:17.655 --> 00:28:20.827
and I thought
it would be so hard.

654
00:28:20.896 --> 00:28:25.517
but one night.
she bundled me up in a snowsuit

655
00:28:25.586 --> 00:28:28.103
and brought us here.

656
00:28:28.172 --> 00:28:30.517
I had no idea
where we were going.

657
00:28:30.586 --> 00:28:35.103
but when we showed up
to the carriage ride...

658
00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:37.344
[exhales]

659
00:28:37.413 --> 00:28:39.655
It was like

660
00:28:39.724 --> 00:28:42.517
a whole new world.

661
00:28:42.586 --> 00:28:46.103
The lights and the horses.

662
00:28:46.172 --> 00:28:50.344
people everywhere.

663
00:28:50.413 --> 00:28:52.172
Happy people.

664
00:28:52.241 --> 00:28:54.379
- Yeah.

665
00:28:54.448 --> 00:28:57.758
I remember when this place was
something special to the town.

666
00:28:57.827 --> 00:28:59.931
To all the neighboring counties
as well.

667
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.758
It was...
[sighs]

668
00:29:02.827 --> 00:29:05.931
It was my father's
pride and joy.

669
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.241
So your mom
loved the place too. huh?

670
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.068
- She did.

671
00:29:11.137 --> 00:29:13.482
We were so happy that night.

672
00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:16.586
Yeah. we curled up
under the blankets and--

673
00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:20.655
and we were just taken away.

674
00:29:20.724 --> 00:29:23.034
[sighs]

675
00:29:23.103 --> 00:29:25.724
You know what?
That Christmas.

676
00:29:25.793 --> 00:29:27.931
she started getting
better and better.

677
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.172
I think this place gave her
a little hope again.

678
00:29:30.241 --> 00:29:32.793
I. of course.
loved this place too.

679
00:29:32.862 --> 00:29:35.620
so we came back
every year after.

680
00:29:35.689 --> 00:29:38.482
- What does she think about you
running the place now?

681
00:29:38.551 --> 00:29:40.241
- She's gone.

682
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.103
Almost three years now.

683
00:29:43.172 --> 00:29:45.724
- I'm sorry.

684
00:29:45.793 --> 00:29:47.896
- Thank you.

685
00:29:47.965 --> 00:29:51.931
[sighs]
Anyway...

686
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.103
I think I should get back
to my place.

687
00:29:55.172 --> 00:29:57.448
- Okay.

688
00:29:57.517 --> 00:30:00.310

01:04:15.448 --> 01:04:17.758
- Wy. can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

1376
01:04:19.206 --> 01:04:22.137
- Why did it take you so long
to come home?

1377
01:04:22.206 --> 01:04:24.793
I mean. I'm not angry.
or hurt. or anything.

1378
01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:26.862
It's just...

1379
01:04:26.931 --> 01:04:29.000
it was really hard

1380
01:04:29.068 --> 01:04:32.517
not having you here
for so long.

1381
01:04:32.586 --> 01:04:36.896
And I just wondered
if I had done anything.

1382
01:04:36.965 --> 01:04:39.241
or if it's because I'm sad--

1383
01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:42.724
- No. no. no. please don't ever
think like that. Mom.

1384
01:04:42.793 --> 01:04:44.206
It wasn't you.

1385
01:04:44.275 --> 01:04:46.137
I'm so sorry that it took me
so long to come home.

1386
01:04:46.206 --> 01:04:47.965
It just always felt...

1387
01:04:48.034 --> 01:04:51.896
heavier than the alternative.
you know?

1388
01:04:51.965 --> 01:04:53.827
Being back.

1389
01:04:53.896 --> 01:04:57.413
I--I just see Dad
wherever I look.

1390
01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:02.000
I just really still miss him.
you know?

1391
01:05:02.068 --> 01:05:05.758
- Yeah.
I get that. sweetheart.

1392
01:05:05.827 --> 01:05:08.689
He was one of a kind.

1393
01:05:08.758 --> 01:05:10.275
I don't think we ever
get over the loss

1394
01:05:10.344 --> 01:05:11.931

1395
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.172

to learn to...

lean a little harder on
the ones that are still here.

1397

Wyatt did.

Christmas magic of my own.

01:06:43.482 --> 01:06:46.931
Okay. well.

good news on Sam's sabbatical
from Doctors Without Borders

1424
01:06:49.517 --> 01:06:51.068
would be really nice.
- Mm-hmm.

1425
01:06:51.137 --> 01:06:52.689
- You know. this was the year
we were supposed

1426
01:06:52.758 --> 01:06:53.862
to start trying for a baby.

1427
01:06:53.931 --> 01:06:55.517
and it's already
the end of the year.

1428

he's gonna be home next. so...

It's a tossup between
world peace and a new car.

1438

- Kidding.

I'm kidding.
I'm half-kidding.

the new Mercedes GT.

to leave the ranch.

be entry level. but--

- No. I mean...

1455
01:08:08.655 --> 01:08:11.586
you can't be serious.

1456

1457
01:08:13.448 --> 01:08:16.620
and just come and live
in New York with you?

1458
01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:18.862
Just leave everything
I built here

1459
01:08:18.931 --> 01:08:21.379
in the off chance
that you might.

1460
01:08:21.448 --> 01:08:25.033
or might not. dump me
like all the other guys?

1461
01:08:25.103 --> 01:08:27.344
- I was offering
a possibility.

1462
01:08:27.413 --> 01:08:29.689
- Look.

1463
01:08:29.758 --> 01:08:32.344
you know how much
I hate moving around.

1464
01:08:32.413 --> 01:08:34.724
I already told you that.
- Mm-hmm.

1465
01:08:34.792 --> 01:08:38.792
- And I know that you're used
to focusing on yourself

1466
01:08:38.862 --> 01:08:41.862
before your commitments
to your family.

1467
01:08:41.931 --> 01:08:44.033
your ranch. your mom.

1468
01:08:44.103 --> 01:08:46.689
your friends. your horse.

1469
01:08:46.758 --> 01:08:51.000
but that's just not me.
and that's just not an option.

1470
01:08:52.585 --> 01:08:54.206
- I'm sorry.
[chuckles]

1471
01:08:54.274 --> 01:08:56.827
I guess I'm not perfectly clear
on what your intentions are

1472
01:08:56.896 --> 01:08:58.896
to do here because

1473
01:08:58.965 --> 01:09:01.274
this place isn't gonna be
around much longer.

1474
01:09:01.344 --> 01:09:03.068
and that includes your home.

1475
01:09:03.137 --> 01:09:05.792
and the stable
where your horse lives. so--

1476
01:09:05.862 --> 01:09:07.724
- Yeah. that's thanks to you

1477
01:09:07.792 --> 01:09:10.896
because you cannot think
of anyone but yourself.

1478
01:09:10.965 --> 01:09:13.309

- No. no. it's fine.

It's fine. he's fine.
Keep going. Heath.

to be the bad guy.

You're right.

And I'm used to it.
- That's not true. Wyatt.

1483

- No. it is.
He's right.

1484
01:09:24.068 --> 01:09:27.172
And the truth is. I do care
more about my promotion

1485
01:09:27.241 --> 01:09:29.965
to senior VP than this ranch.
and that is because

1486
01:09:30.033 --> 01:09:31.758
I have worked
for everything that I have

1487
01:09:31.827 --> 01:09:33.792
and I will not apologize
for it.

1488
01:09:33.862 --> 01:09:35.448
And I happen to think
it's a whole lot better

1489
01:09:35.517 --> 01:09:37.103
than just sitting around here
in hibernation

1490

1491

when none of you actually are.

1492
01:09:41.482 --> 01:09:44.033
- All right. that's not fair.
We're doing just fine.

1493
01:09:44.103 --> 01:09:45.620
- Okay. you're not just
waiting around all day

Wyatt. it's almost Christmas.

1527

I know you're hurt.

1528
01:11:33.724 --> 01:11:36.862
but can't you stay
until after the holiday?

1529
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:40.172
- Yeah. I gotta get back
and get this whole proposal

1530
01:11:40.241 --> 01:11:42.655

before the new year. so--

1531

- What about Heath?

01:11:44.206 --> 01:11:45.550
If you go.
it's gonna break his heart.

what he set me up to do?

To disappoint him?

1535
01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:54.517
Anyway. he doesn't wanna
leave his home

1536
01:11:54.585 --> 01:11:56.689
and I gotta stop pretending
that this is still mine.
