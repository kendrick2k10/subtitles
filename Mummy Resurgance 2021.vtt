We're in a time loop
until we lift the curse.

what if it doesn't work?

- Uh-huh.

82
00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.793
Mask up. Serious.

(ominous music)

84
00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:05.766
- You know.
considering the smell.

85
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.870
it doesn't smell that bad.

86
00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:12.205
You know. being
dead for so long.

87
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.007
Considering what they
said about the stench

88
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.476
if you breathe that stuff in.

89
00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.079
- Kind of creepy.

90
00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:23.551
- You're not scared of a
dead corpse. now are you?

91
00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:24.952
- Well you know the legends.

92
00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:26.787
- The legends?

93
00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:29.056
The urban legends?

94
00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:30.057
You tosser.

95
00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:33.226
- Well. I've always been
wanting to be a bit of a...

96
00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:34.528
I don't know.

97
00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:36.530
A bit of a believer
in the supernatural.

98
00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:39.567
- Come on. ain't
nothing be scared about.

99

up in cloth. mate. Q

- Earth to Holly.

105
00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:12.966
- I'm sorry.

106
00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:16.036
- What's going on?

107
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:18.839
- It's nothing.

108
00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:20.708
- Holly. Come on.

109
00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:27.548
- It's just my brother
hasn't been replying

110
00:07:27.615 --> 00:07:29.416
to my texts or calls.

111
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.252
And he left me this really
strange voice message yesterday.

112
00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.355
And I just. I'm
worried about him.

113
00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:37.591
You know?

114
00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.326
- Well. what kind
of voice message?

115
00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:48.536
- Well. he has bipolar.

116
00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:51.471
so we have to be really
careful around him. you know?

117
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:56.476
And he was just having a moment

118
00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:01.549
and in the message he said
that he felt really alone.

119
00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:04.852
I'm. yeah.

120
00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.256
- I'm sure it's nothing.

121
00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:11.625
Just give him time.

122
00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:14.762
(ominous music)

123
00:08:14.762 --> 00:08:15.563
- Yeah.

124
00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:18.666
I just worry about
his mental state

125
00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:22.069
since dad left and now
his girlfriend's left him.

126
00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:29.877
I just. I don't want him to
think he's alone. you know?

127
00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:35.282
- Well. I'm sure he'll
call you back tonight.

128
00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:36.884
Stop being such a worrywart.

129
00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:41.488
- Yeah.

130
00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:44.792
Yeah. you're right.

131
00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:45.926
You're totally right.

132
00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:48.228
I'm just being silly.

133
00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:52.065
- I am always right. Missy.

134
00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:58.105
- (chuckling) Yeah.

135
00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:04.244
- Hey. we left that
thing in your class

136
00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:05.512
if you wanna go and check it out

137
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.647
We're gonna head off in 10.

138
00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:08.616
so any issues. give us a shout.

139
00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:10.918
- Okay. lovely. Thank you.

140
00:09:10.918 --> 00:09:12.653
- Just to let you know. love.

141
00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:15.288
that body's been in
that crate for years.

142
00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:16.389
Thousands.

143
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.390
We don't know what's in it.

144
00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:18.358
Stale air.

145
00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:20.193
So when you go around it.

146
00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:22.129
just make sure that
you wear a mask.

147
00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:23.563
- Of course. no problem.

148
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.332
I understand.

149
00:09:25.332 --> 00:09:27.334
- Yeah. there was an incident
when I found that thing.

150
00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:28.936
Someone died.

151
00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:30.804
They don't know
exactly what happened.

152
00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:34.908
Some say it was mold from
an allergic reaction.

153
00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:36.376
Obviously. it was gas.

154
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:40.080
You know. it could burn
your eyes. your nose.

155
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.882
Kill you. basically.
- We're not trying

156
00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.116
to scare you off or nothing.

157
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.351
Just make sure whoever
goes near that thing

158
00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:46.553
is wearing a mask.

159
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.988
- Right. yeah.

160
00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:49.322
- See ya.
- Thank you.

161
00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:50.123
Bye.

162
00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:54.294
- What was that. Miss Dawson?

163
00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:56.797
- Do you want to come and
take a look? Come with me.

164
00:09:56.797 --> 00:09:59.432
(ominous music)

165
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:09.509
Stay there.

166
00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:31.164
Do you like it?

167
00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:33.600
We spent most of the
university budget on it.

168
00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:37.137
- Wow. This is fascinating.

169
00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:39.606
Miss Dawson. the
students will love this.

170
00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:42.275
(ominous music)

171
00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.564
- That's enough for today.

172
00:11:04.564 --> 00:11:06.399
You can examine it
properly tomorrow.

173
00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:15.375
- [Man] I just really
need someone to talk to.

174
00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:21.048
I never felt so
alone in so long.

175
00:11:23.717 --> 00:11:26.286
I feel like I'm
messing everything up.

176
00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:31.491
I try so hard.

177
00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.127
But whatever I do
seems to go wrong.

178
00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:40.467
Sometimes I just don't know
if this is for me. you know?

179
00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:42.535
I just don't know.
- You can't keep

180
00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:43.670
listening to that.

181
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.172
- Goodbye. Curley.
- Look.

182
00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:49.009
if you wanna. I don't
know. go by his place.

183
00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:50.010
I can come with you.

184
00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:56.249
- I just. I don't
want to suffocate him.

185
00:11:57.284 --> 00:11:59.887
He clearly wants the space

186
00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:02.089
and I just need
to give it to him.

187
00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:06.927
- Whatever you think is best.

188
00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:09.129
I will be there and
I will support you.

189
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.232
- World's number one flatmate.

190
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.400
- You know it.

191
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.036
(ominous music)

192
00:12:29.116 --> 00:12:31.985
(phone vibrating)

193
00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:49.469
- Hello?

194
00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:52.105
(ominous music)

195
00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:20.200
(Holly sobbing)
(intense music)

196
00:13:38.886 --> 00:13:39.686
It's over.

197
00:13:41.054 --> 00:13:43.290
(sobbing)

198
00:13:56.636 --> 00:13:58.271
- No. no. that's fine.

199
00:13:58.305 --> 00:13:59.406
She's here with me now.

200
00:14:01.608 --> 00:14:04.177
No. but you know these things.

201
00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.246
they take time.

202
00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:07.047
Yeah.

203
00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:11.284
All right. Yeah.
I'll let her know.

204
00:14:11.284 --> 00:14:12.886
Thank you. You too.

205
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.720
Bye.

206
00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:24.131
Hey. so your mom said not
to go over there right now.

207
00:14:25.332 --> 00:14:26.566
Just 'cause your dad's
all over the place.

208
00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:28.535
They don't want you to
see him in this state.

209
00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:30.870
She said just. you know.
give it a day or so.

210
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.871
then we can see.

211
00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:39.446
- Did she say how he did it?

212
00:14:42.082 --> 00:14:43.616
- Holly. I think you just.

213
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.885
you really need to focus
on yourself right now.

214
00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:49.923
- I want to know.

215
00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:54.127
- Why?

216
00:14:57.664 --> 00:14:58.565
- He's my brother.

217
00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:02.802
I want to know.

218
00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:11.411
- I just. I don't think
now is the time. you know?

219
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.413
- I've gotta go.
- Where?

220
00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:16.116
- Class.
- What?

221
00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:20.053
No. no. no. You can't
go anywhere today.

222
00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:22.489
I called in sick. You
have to stay here.

223
00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:25.725
- I can't sit here
with these thoughts.

224
00:15:25.725 --> 00:15:28.528
You know me. I need
something to focus on.

225
00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:30.163
and we have finals coming up

226
00:15:30.163 --> 00:15:31.598
and this isn't the
time to be slacking off

227
00:15:31.631 --> 00:15:33.800
and we really need to do well.

228
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.003
- Okay. I get that you
want to get busy. I do.

229
00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:37.004
But you don't need
to do this. okay?

230
00:15:37.004 --> 00:15:38.371
You can stay here with me.

231
00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:44.211
- What I need is for things
to feel normal right now.

232
00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:46.046
Okay?

233
00:15:57.757 --> 00:15:59.559
- Okay. class.

234
00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:03.530
Today. I have a very
special treat for you.

235
00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:07.400
In our last lesson. we
went over the history

236
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.137
of mummification and mummies.

237
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.106
Today. you're going
to be able to see

238
00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:15.708
and examine one in real life.

239
00:16:17.244 --> 00:16:21.414
However. you must wear the
masks that are on your desk

240
00:16:21.448 --> 00:16:24.951
at all times when going
anywhere near the mummy.

241
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:27.954
I cannot stress how
important this is.

242
00:16:27.954 --> 00:16:29.756
It's for your health and safety.

243
00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:32.559
Remember what I taught you

244
00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:35.162
when they opened
the Pharaoh's tomb.

245
00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:37.697
an archeologist died.

246
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.400
And this was caused by
different kinds of mold

247
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.635
which may cause
allergic reactions

248
00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:45.372
or a concoction of
different substances

249
00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:49.209
which are toxic and could
potentially kill you.

250
00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:52.445
So please be careful and
follow my instructions

251
00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:56.549
when going near the mummy
and wear your masks.

252
00:16:56.616 --> 00:17:00.987
Remember. the mummy
is very. very old

253
00:17:00.987 --> 00:17:05.558
and we have to preserve it as
well as yourselves. of course.

254
00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:10.430
Now I for one never
thought or even dreamed.

255
00:17:10.497 --> 00:17:12.432
we'd be able to have
firsthand experience

256
00:17:12.432 --> 00:17:14.234
at examining a mummy.

257
00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:17.070
Well. not within the
walls of the university.

258
00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:23.276
But finals are coming up
and you need to write about

259
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:26.279
(marker scraping)

260
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.852
the Egyptian ways of living.

261
00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:37.157
Now that includes the time.

262
00:17:38.925 --> 00:17:39.826
and the period.

263
00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.163
and methods.

264
00:17:45.832 --> 00:17:46.933
And of course.

265
00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:50.170
mummification.

266
00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:59.446
Now. who can tell
me what a mummy is?

267
00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:02.081
Anyone?

268
00:18:03.216 --> 00:18:04.016
No?

269
00:18:04.984 --> 00:18:06.919
A mummy is someone whose body

270
00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.721
has been preserved after death.

271
00:18:10.257 --> 00:18:13.226
When I said. mummy. how
many of you pictured

272
00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:16.929
a human form wrapped
in layers of bandages.

273
00:18:16.963 --> 00:18:20.633
arising from a tomb
in a zombified manner?

274
00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:22.435
(chuckles)

275
00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:26.506
Mummies are real and have
a fascinating history.

276
00:18:26.573 --> 00:18:29.041
And contrary to popular belief.

277
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.110
they don't rise from the dead.

278
00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:35.682
Mummification has been
found all over the world

279
00:18:35.682 --> 00:18:38.785
and used by various
different civilizations

280
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:43.456
such as Incan. African. Aztec.

281
00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:47.594
Aboriginal and ancient
European and many more.

282
00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:50.096
It's been used for
thousands of years

283
00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:52.532
to honor and preserve the dead.

284
00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:57.637
Now these rituals ranged from
one civilization to the next.

285
00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.441
Some cultures chose to
mummify all of its citizens.

286
00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:05.445
whereas others chose to
mummify only the very wealthy

287
00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:06.913
or people of status.

288
00:19:06.946 --> 00:19:08.648
(ominous music)

289
00:19:08.681 --> 00:19:10.116
The easiest way
to create a mummy

290
00:19:10.116 --> 00:19:15.087
was to expose the body to
sun or fire or freezing cold.

291
00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:19.226
And that's because most
bacteria cannot live

292
00:19:19.292 --> 00:19:21.694
or survive in
extreme temperatures.

293
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:26.333
Now. for a Egyptian mummies.

294
00:19:27.434 --> 00:19:30.570
Now the most important
part of a body

295
00:19:30.603 --> 00:19:32.772
to be mummified back then

296
00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:36.376
was to preserve as much
skin tissue as possible.

297
00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:40.347
And the mummification
experts were the priests.

298
00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:43.716
As you all know. Egypt
is a fairly hot country.

299
00:19:43.716 --> 00:19:47.854
So it was pretty easy to
mummify and dry out a corpse.

300
00:19:47.887 --> 00:19:51.891
However. there was a
very specific process

301
00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:55.495
that you had to follow
to ensure that the dead

302
00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.964
will be granted passage
to the afterlife.

303
00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:00.400
Yes.

304
00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:03.803
- What time period
was this mummy from?

305
00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:07.240
- This is an authentic
Egyptian mummy.

306
00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:11.444
unearthed from an
Egyptian temple.

307
00:20:11.444 --> 00:20:14.314
The ancient Egyptian Kings.

308
00:20:16.516 --> 00:20:18.050
This is said to be one of them.

309
00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:22.054
And what makes this so special

310
00:20:22.088 --> 00:20:24.991
is that we are the
first university

311
00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:27.527
to be granted access
to this mummy.

312
00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.196
- You're saying we get
to unearth the findings

313
00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:31.097
behind this mummy?

314
00:20:32.632 --> 00:20:33.633
- Yes.

315
00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:37.136
And if your findings are
proven to be substantial.

316
00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:40.206
they will be
published in writing.

317
00:20:41.608 --> 00:20:45.645
This could be a career changing
opportunity for you all.

318
00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:50.750
If we can uncover more
about this ancient king.

319
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:55.254
well this could set you all
up as archeology students

320
00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:57.757
going straight
into research jobs.

321
00:21:01.561 --> 00:21:06.032
Right. so gloves on and
come and take a look.

322
00:21:18.845 --> 00:21:21.548
(ominous music)

323
00:21:29.989 --> 00:21:30.957
- Do you mind if I

324
00:21:33.826 --> 00:21:37.029
(mystical music)

325
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:38.030
take a look at this?

326
00:21:39.165 --> 00:21:40.266
- Of course.

327
00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:52.345
(mystical music)

328
00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:55.948
(intense music)
- Yo. yo. yo!

329
00:21:57.249 --> 00:21:58.485
- Kira.

330
00:21:58.485 --> 00:22:00.252
- Sorry. Didn't mean
to make you jump.

331
00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:02.555
- So check this out.

332
00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:06.626
This king. he wasn't just
an ancient Egyptian king.

333
00:22:06.693 --> 00:22:08.695
He was part of a pack of kings

334
00:22:08.695 --> 00:22:11.130
that ruled between approximately

335
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.801
450 and 250 BC.

336
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:16.603
- Holy shit. Are you serious?

337
00:22:16.603 --> 00:22:20.039
- Yeah. I can't find anything
online to suggest otherwise.

338
00:22:21.307 --> 00:22:24.076
And these words. like
there's something...

339
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.848
I don't know.

340
00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.153
- You should tell Miss Dawson.

341
00:22:35.121 --> 00:22:35.922
- Mm.

342
00:22:42.762 --> 00:22:45.231
Kira. don't look
at me like that.

343
00:22:51.003 --> 00:22:52.405
- Mark told me.

344
00:22:57.777 --> 00:23:00.112
- I just don't wanna talk
about it right now. okay?

345
00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:01.714
- You shouldn't hide
stuff like this from me.

346
00:23:01.748 --> 00:23:03.349
I'm your best friend.

347
00:23:03.349 --> 00:23:05.985
(somber music)

348
00:23:07.253 --> 00:23:09.155
You don't need to
hide this from me.

349
00:23:09.155 --> 00:23:11.090
I need. I want to help.

350
00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:13.760
And the way I help is I need
to know what's going on.

351
00:23:15.495 --> 00:23:16.763
- Sorry.

352
00:23:16.763 --> 00:23:19.398
I just. my head's not
been in the right place.

353
00:23:19.432 --> 00:23:20.833
And I just...

354
00:23:20.833 --> 00:23:22.368
(ominous music)

355
00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:24.604
I don't know how to deal with
this right now. you know?

356
00:23:24.604 --> 00:23:27.406
And I just find it
easier if we just...

357
00:23:28.875 --> 00:23:31.611
- Don't dig a big hole that
you can't get out of. Holly.

358
00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:34.881
- I'm sorry. I'm like this.

359
00:23:35.815 --> 00:23:36.683
- Don't be sorry.

360
00:23:36.683 --> 00:23:39.318
(both chuckle)

361
00:23:41.754 --> 00:23:43.956
Now. go and tell Miss
Dawson what you found

362
00:23:45.124 --> 00:23:45.925
- Okay.

363
00:23:48.895 --> 00:23:50.563
- God. I wonder what that
would have been like?

364
00:23:50.563 --> 00:23:52.732
To be mummified while
you're still alive?

365
00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:54.801
- Yeah. but that didn't
happen here. right?

366
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:56.402
- No. there wasn't even torture.

367
00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.472
(ominous music)

368
00:23:59.472 --> 00:24:02.575
- Some bodies were
mummified accidentally.

369
00:24:02.609 --> 00:24:04.410
Like the mummies of Guanajuato

370
00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:06.245
discovered in Mexico.

371
00:24:06.245 --> 00:24:08.447
where over 100
mummies were found

372
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:10.750
in above-ground crypts.

373
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.452
It would appear that
due to the extreme heat

374
00:24:13.486 --> 00:24:16.288
and the mixture of sulfur
and different minerals

375
00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:19.559
that caused the bodies
to mummify naturally.

376
00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:21.628
but accidentally.

377
00:24:23.129 --> 00:24:26.933
Some found that Buddhist monks
practice self-mummification.

378
00:24:26.933 --> 00:24:30.136
To achieve this. they
would starve themselves

379
00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:32.038
and then only eat certain foods

380
00:24:32.038 --> 00:24:33.906
that would boost
the decay process.

381
00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:36.709
trying to get rid
of their body fat.

382
00:24:36.709 --> 00:24:39.345
They would then drink
the poisonous sap

383
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:42.882
to make them vomit to
get rid of bodily fluids.

384
00:24:42.882 --> 00:24:46.318
And the poisonous sap made
the body unsavory to bugs.

385
00:24:46.352 --> 00:24:48.855
who had a pension for
feasting on corpses

386
00:24:49.722 --> 00:24:51.958
The final stage of the process.

387
00:24:51.991 --> 00:24:54.093
they would be buried alive

388
00:24:54.126 --> 00:24:57.129
and wait to die
and be mummified.

389
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.832
They usually died
pretty quickly.

390
00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:03.135
And on occasion. a
self-mummification worked.

391
00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:05.805
- Hey. I think I
found something.

392
00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:11.477
- I can't quite believe it.

393
00:25:13.746 --> 00:25:15.948
The discovery of
the hidden kings.

394
00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:18.585
- A king erased by history.

395
00:25:20.052 --> 00:25:22.689
- So you don't think this
is a discovery as such?

396
00:25:22.722 --> 00:25:25.424
- The story is why were
these kings hidden?

397
00:25:25.424 --> 00:25:27.326
What were they doing that
made people want them

398
00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:28.595
hidden in history?

399
00:25:30.763 --> 00:25:32.464
- Absolutely fascinating.

400
00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:38.504
(necklace jangles)

401
00:25:39.572 --> 00:25:41.440
Uh. Tracy.

402
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.242
(mystical music)

403
00:25:43.242 --> 00:25:44.443
Be careful with that.

404
00:25:45.912 --> 00:25:47.046
- It's beautiful. huh?

405
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.282
- Just don't drop it.

406
00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:52.985
(ominous music)

407
00:25:55.655 --> 00:25:57.657
Let me just check this out.

408
00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:00.793
(keyboard clattering)

409
00:26:11.604 --> 00:26:13.773
- "The kingdom rose.

410
00:26:13.806 --> 00:26:15.407
the darkness be chose.

411
00:26:16.375 --> 00:26:18.678
The men that be.
the men that see

412
00:26:19.746 --> 00:26:21.213
allow them to rise.

413
00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:23.883
Let the dark
foreshadow the light.

414
00:26:23.883 --> 00:26:25.084
(ominous music)

415
00:26:25.084 --> 00:26:26.719
Allow him to rise."

416
00:26:29.555 --> 00:26:31.824
These words. they
don't make sense.

417
00:26:32.992 --> 00:26:34.994
The kingdom rose. the
darkness be chose.

418
00:26:36.362 --> 00:26:38.831
Miss Dawson. do you
think this could be

419
00:26:38.865 --> 00:26:42.835
some kind of. I
dunno. like prayer?

420
00:26:45.404 --> 00:26:46.472
- Let me see.

421
00:26:46.472 --> 00:26:49.208
(ominous music)

422
00:26:55.014 --> 00:26:56.248
A prayer. no.

423
00:26:59.786 --> 00:27:00.753
A summoning.

424
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:02.989
A spell.

425
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.625
(ominous music)

426
00:27:06.693 --> 00:27:08.094
Dark magic.

427
00:27:12.665 --> 00:27:14.633
Let me show this to
Professor Matthews.

428
00:27:16.435 --> 00:27:17.870
Wait here.

429
00:27:17.937 --> 00:27:20.572
(ominous music)

430
00:27:27.814 --> 00:27:30.349
(knocking)

431
00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:31.951
Grace.

432
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:33.485
- Hi. Martha. How are you doing?

433
00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:34.486
- Good. Thank you.

434
00:27:35.922 --> 00:27:37.056
Sorry to come in.

435
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.360
Look. I think I found something.

436
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.162
- The students
enjoying their mummy?

437
00:27:45.364 --> 00:27:48.034
- We think that we
found something.

438
00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:52.204
We think that the
mummy we had delivered.

439
00:27:53.372 --> 00:27:55.074
we think it was a hidden king.

440
00:27:56.809 --> 00:28:00.012
A period of time in ancient
history. it was deleted.

441
00:28:00.046 --> 00:28:01.547
People didn't know
what happened.

442
00:28:01.547 --> 00:28:05.584
It was like a chapter of
ancient Egyptian history

443
00:28:05.651 --> 00:28:07.553
was just erased.

444
00:28:07.553 --> 00:28:10.289
But we think we know who
walked in those times.

445
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:12.992
- I thought this
was just going to be

446
00:28:12.992 --> 00:28:14.226
a good photo opportunity.

447
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:17.797
- We think that
those who walked then

448
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:19.231
were the Lost Kings.

449
00:28:20.466 --> 00:28:21.667
They were said to
be that of a myth.

450
00:28:21.734 --> 00:28:26.605
But now I think that
what we have here

451
00:28:27.373 --> 00:28:29.441
is in fact a lost king.

452
00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:32.078
(ominous music)

453
00:28:34.847 --> 00:28:35.647
Look.

454
00:28:38.484 --> 00:28:39.551
Do you see what I do?

455
00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:44.723
- We shouldn't get too excited.

456
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:46.793
Have your team
keep working on it.

457
00:28:46.826 --> 00:28:48.227
But keep it on the low down.

458
00:28:49.595 --> 00:28:52.799
This could be
brilliant breakthrough.

459
00:28:53.766 --> 00:28:57.169
- Huh.

460
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:58.905
- A real. true discovery.

461
00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:02.408
- I know. We could be famous.

462
00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:04.443
- No. but seriously

463
00:29:04.443 --> 00:29:06.078
This is incredible.

464
00:29:06.112 --> 00:29:07.146
People spend their whole lives

465
00:29:07.213 --> 00:29:09.015
trying to uncover history.

466
00:29:09.015 --> 00:29:10.082
and here we are.

467
00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:12.284
we might have just done it.

468
00:29:12.318 --> 00:29:15.454
- Well. we sure as well will
be remembered if this is legit.

469
00:29:16.923 --> 00:29:18.925
- Yeah. Do you want anything?

470
00:29:18.925 --> 00:29:21.327
- No. I'm fine. Thanks.

471
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.628
- Back in a bit.

472
00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:23.729
- Okay. fine.

473
00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:29.235
(ominous music)

474
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:36.042
(door closes)

475
00:29:36.042 --> 00:29:39.045
(suspenseful music)

476
00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:49.721
(bones cracking)

477
00:29:54.827 --> 00:29:57.596
(mummy snarling)

478
00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:04.336
(Tracy gasping)

479
00:30:05.604 --> 00:30:10.209
(Tracy choking)
(neck snapping)

480
00:30:10.242 --> 00:30:13.012
(mummy growling)

481
00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:18.450
(body thudding)

482
00:30:18.484 --> 00:30:21.153
(mummy snarling)

483
00:30:21.153 --> 00:30:23.789
(ominous music)

484
00:30:27.593 --> 00:30:30.696
(necklace jangling)

485
00:30:39.438 --> 00:30:41.607
- How is she doing really?

486
00:30:43.609 --> 00:30:45.177
- Well. she's not saying much.

487
00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:47.446
I think she blames
herself deep down.

488
00:30:47.446 --> 00:30:48.915
- It's not her fault.

489
00:30:48.948 --> 00:30:50.482
What happened with her brother.

490
00:30:50.482 --> 00:30:52.684
I mean. you can't predict what
people are thinking inside.

491
00:30:54.153 --> 00:30:56.322
- He called her and asked her
to come over to his place.

492
00:30:56.322 --> 00:30:57.756
She feels like she failed him.

493
00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:58.991
- Yeah. but she didn't
know that was gonna be

494
00:30:58.991 --> 00:31:00.359
his last ever phone call.

495
00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:01.560
- Look. we just gotta
be there for her

496
00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:03.629
if and when she
might need us. okay?

497
00:31:06.832 --> 00:31:11.837
- Yeah.

498
00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:16.508
(ominous music)

499
00:31:27.653 --> 00:31:30.389
(bones cracking)

500
00:31:32.992 --> 00:31:35.727
(mummy snarling)

501
00:31:46.672 --> 00:31:49.275
(ominous music)

502
00:32:04.123 --> 00:32:06.825
(intense music)

503
00:32:20.606 --> 00:32:21.407
Where is it?

504
00:32:22.474 --> 00:32:25.477
- I have no idea.

505
00:32:27.846 --> 00:32:29.281
- You don't think it...
- No.

506
00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:32.684
- No?
- No. someone moved it.

507
00:32:38.924 --> 00:32:40.426
- Oh. my God!

508
00:32:40.492 --> 00:32:41.293
Oh. my God!

509
00:32:41.327 --> 00:32:43.962
(ominous music)

510
00:32:47.866 --> 00:32:49.135
We need to go.

511
00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.005
Come on. we need
to go now. Come on!

512
00:32:53.005 --> 00:32:55.607
(ominous music)

513
00:33:04.683 --> 00:33:05.584
(bones cracking)

514
00:33:05.584 --> 00:33:08.054
(crows cawing)

515
00:33:08.087 --> 00:33:11.090
(suspenseful music)

516
00:33:15.627 --> 00:33:17.229
- Is someone there?

517
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:38.050
If someone's messing
about. come out now.

518
00:33:52.331 --> 00:33:53.132
Oh.

519
00:33:56.602 --> 00:33:58.170
Right. whoever moved this thing.

520
00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.106
come out now. please.

521
00:34:00.106 --> 00:34:03.075
(suspenseful music)

522
00:34:06.678 --> 00:34:09.448
(bones cracking)

523
00:34:23.028 --> 00:34:26.665
I said. whoever moved
this thing. come out now.

524
00:34:34.606 --> 00:34:37.075
(suspenseful music)

525
00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:39.945
If you don't tell me.
I'll find out myself.

526
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.046
(door bangs)

527
00:34:41.046 --> 00:34:44.049
(suspenseful music)

528
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:13.111
(mummy snarling)

529
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:15.747
(intense music)

530
00:35:26.358 --> 00:35:27.159
Oh my God!

531
00:35:27.193 --> 00:35:29.928
(mummy growling)

532
00:35:32.998 --> 00:35:35.567
- It's already in accounts-
- Miss!

533
00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:36.568
- Come quickly!
- What is it?

534
00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:38.770
- Come quickly. come!

535
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:40.672
Come. quickly!
- I'm coming.

536
00:35:40.672 --> 00:35:43.709
(ominous music)

537
00:35:43.775 --> 00:35:44.576
- Mom?

538
00:35:48.547 --> 00:35:50.015
(sighs) Great.

539
00:35:50.048 --> 00:35:50.849
Signal.

540
00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:55.487
- (sighs) What do you
mean the mummy has gone?

541
00:35:55.521 --> 00:35:57.122
- We think someone took it.

542
00:35:57.122 --> 00:35:59.325
Stole it. Shit. I don't know.

543
00:35:59.325 --> 00:36:01.960
- We're just really
scared that Tracy's dead.

544
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.065
(ominous music)

545
00:36:08.467 --> 00:36:10.736
(Miss Dawson sighs)

546
00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:11.970
- What's going on?

547
00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:14.105
- Something happened to Tracy.

548
00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:16.842
(ominous music)

549
00:36:22.314 --> 00:36:23.915
- Okay. it was just...

550
00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:26.685
(ominous music)

551
00:36:28.287 --> 00:36:30.289
- Girls. what is going on here?

552
00:36:32.157 --> 00:36:33.792
- I don't...

553
00:36:33.825 --> 00:36:37.229
She was right there.

554
00:36:37.296 --> 00:36:38.730
I'm confused.

555
00:36:40.732 --> 00:36:43.402
- You said that Tracy
was on the ground.

556
00:36:43.402 --> 00:36:44.870
Are you sure it wasn't a joke?

557
00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.905
- No. Miss. she was there.

558
00:36:46.972 --> 00:36:48.507
She wasn't moving.

559
00:36:48.507 --> 00:36:49.875
- Yeah. we checked
her breathing.

560
00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:51.477
- You have to believe us.

561
00:36:51.477 --> 00:36:53.312
- What exactly happened?

562
00:36:53.345 --> 00:36:55.647
- She was laying on the ground

563
00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:58.884
and we checked her. but nothing.

564
00:36:58.884 --> 00:37:00.652
She was totally gone.

565
00:37:02.454 --> 00:37:05.324
- Well. if what
you're saying is true.

566
00:37:06.725 --> 00:37:09.328
then we need to seal off this
room and call the police.

567
00:37:09.361 --> 00:37:10.629
- No. someone's in the school.

568
00:37:10.629 --> 00:37:12.531
We've got to get out.

569
00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:14.566
- Or maybe it's
what you said. Miss.

570
00:37:14.566 --> 00:37:17.569
Like what if that was a
chemical release by the mummy?

571
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:19.204
Was she wearing
her mask around it?

572
00:37:19.204 --> 00:37:20.406
- She was.

573
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.910
- The mummy.

574
00:37:31.683 --> 00:37:33.719
All I can think is
that someone broke in

575
00:37:33.719 --> 00:37:34.786
and stole the mummy.

576
00:37:36.288 --> 00:37:39.491
And Tracy tried to fend
them off and got attacked.

577
00:37:39.525 --> 00:37:42.428
And what the girls
saw. she wasn't dead.

578
00:37:42.428 --> 00:37:44.162
She was knocked out.

579
00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:48.434
- But if that happened. why
hasn't Tracy shown up by now?

580
00:37:48.467 --> 00:37:51.470
- Tracy would have called the
police or something. surely.

581
00:37:51.537 --> 00:37:54.406
(mystical music)

582
00:37:54.406 --> 00:37:56.408
- What do you wanna do tonight?

583
00:37:56.442 --> 00:37:58.043
- Mm. not sure.

584
00:37:58.076 --> 00:37:59.711
Open-minded.

585
00:37:59.745 --> 00:38:01.947
And we have to be
there for Holly.

586
00:38:01.947 --> 00:38:03.248
Maybe we could do
something for her.

587
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:05.150
Something nice.

588
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.118
We could go get some
food or something.

589
00:38:08.454 --> 00:38:11.056
- Yeah. I think I'm just
gonna go and see Brian.

590
00:38:11.056 --> 00:38:13.392
- (sighs) Please
give up on that guy.

591
00:38:13.392 --> 00:38:15.527
He's a total douche.

592
00:38:15.527 --> 00:38:16.995
- Hot douche.

593
00:38:17.028 --> 00:38:18.997
- But still a douche.

594
00:38:18.997 --> 00:38:21.232
Like why do you need him. Lyne?

595
00:38:21.266 --> 00:38:22.734
- Okay. I'm sorry.

596
00:38:22.768 --> 00:38:24.803
But you know me and I have
to be honest with you.

597
00:38:24.803 --> 00:38:25.604
- Go on.

598
00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:29.675
- Well. if he was into
you. you would know by now

599
00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:30.909
- What do you mean?

600
00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:32.544
- Well. he's had
his shot with you

601
00:38:32.544 --> 00:38:34.646
and he's pushed and
pushed you away.

602
00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:36.715
He just doesn't see
what you has with you.

603
00:38:38.617 --> 00:38:40.986
- What so you think I
should just sack off then?

604
00:38:40.986 --> 00:38:41.887
- I would say so.

605
00:38:45.357 --> 00:38:48.159
(toilet flushing)

606
00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:56.334
(ominous music)

607
00:38:57.335 --> 00:39:00.406
(water flowing)

608
00:39:00.406 --> 00:39:03.642
Trace. I don't think there's
any soap in that sink.

609
00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:06.712
(suspenseful music)

610
00:39:07.846 --> 00:39:08.647
Tracy?

611
00:39:12.984 --> 00:39:13.785
Tracy?

612
00:39:26.465 --> 00:39:27.265
Tracy?

613
00:39:30.802 --> 00:39:33.104
Tracy. what happened to you?

614
00:39:37.443 --> 00:39:39.310
(woman gasping)

615
00:39:39.344 --> 00:39:42.013
(intense music)

616
00:39:57.162 --> 00:39:58.830
Someone help me. please!

617
00:39:58.830 --> 00:39:59.998
Please. please!

618
00:39:59.998 --> 00:40:01.833
Please. please. help me!

619

(intense music)

620
00:40:06.805 --> 00:40:10.241
(sobbing) Stop it. Tracy!

621
00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:11.710
Stop!

622
00:40:11.777 --> 00:40:15.080
(gasping) Miss Mathews!

623
00:40:16.682 --> 00:40:19.250
Miss Mathews. please.
what the hell is going...

624
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.186
(ominous music)

625
00:40:21.186 --> 00:40:24.523
(Miss Mathews snarling)

626
00:40:28.527 --> 00:40:30.929
No! (sobbing)

627
00:40:30.962 --> 00:40:32.498
No!

628

630
00:40:48.446 --> 00:40:49.848
Stop it. please!

631

Someone help me!

632

(Lyne panting)

671
00:45:01.332 --> 00:45:03.802
- What the fuck just happened?

672
00:45:06.004 --> 00:45:08.774
(ominous music)

673
00:45:22.087 --> 00:45:22.888
- Hello?

674
00:45:22.921 --> 00:45:25.924
(static buzzing)

675
00:45:25.957 --> 00:45:27.759
Hello? This is an emergency.

676
00:45:27.793 --> 00:45:30.195
Can any member of staff read me?

677
00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:32.964
(static buzzing)

678
00:45:33.965 --> 00:45:35.000
Hello?

679
00:45:35.033 --> 00:45:37.335
We need assistance urgently.

680
00:45:37.368 --> 00:45:38.970
(static buzzing)

681
00:45:39.004 --> 00:45:41.406
There's nothing.
There's no signal.

682
00:45:41.406 --> 00:45:43.008
- Everyone. check your phones.

683
00:45:46.544 --> 00:45:47.345
- Nothing.

684
00:45:48.847 --> 00:45:49.948
- No. me neither.

685
00:45:52.283 --> 00:45:54.352
- So weird. We
usually have signal.

686
00:45:55.286 --> 00:45:57.088
- Right. who has a car?

687
00:45:57.122 --> 00:45:57.989
- Mine's out back.

688
00:45:58.957 --> 00:46:00.425
- Okay. Mark. take your car.

689
00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:02.160
go to the nearest
house. call the police.

690
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.895
I'm going to stay here
and look for Tracy.

691
00:46:03.929 --> 00:46:05.496
- I don't wanna stay here.

692
00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:06.264
- Come with me?

693
00:46:07.165 --> 00:46:08.566
- Okay.
- Okay.

694
00:46:08.566 --> 00:46:09.367
Holly. come.

695
00:46:11.937 --> 00:46:13.504
- Oh. I can't leave Tracy.

696
00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:14.372
You go.

697
00:46:15.673 --> 00:46:17.408
- We'll be back soon.

698
00:46:17.442 --> 00:46:18.609
We'll be back.

699
00:46:23.949 --> 00:46:25.250
(suspenseful music)

700
00:46:25.283 --> 00:46:27.485
- What. what the hell?

701
00:46:27.485 --> 00:46:29.487
- We just-
- We just went

702
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.488
through the front door and-

703
00:46:30.488 --> 00:46:31.289
- Yeah.

704
00:46:32.323 --> 00:46:34.725
- Why are we in reception again?

705
00:46:34.759 --> 00:46:35.760
- I have no idea.

706
00:46:43.768 --> 00:46:44.769
- The phone!

707
00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:54.112
(dial tone beeping)

708
00:46:54.112 --> 00:46:56.114
(sighs)

709
00:46:57.248 --> 00:46:59.317
- Please. don't tell me.

710
00:47:01.052 --> 00:47:03.054
- How can all the phones
in the school be down?

711
00:47:03.054 --> 00:47:04.655
I was taking a call
not an hour ago.

712
00:47:04.689 --> 00:47:05.490
They were fine.

713
00:47:11.162 --> 00:47:13.198
- It's just dawned on me.

714
00:47:14.199 --> 00:47:16.334
But where is everyone else?

715
00:47:16.367 --> 00:47:17.335
- What do you mean?

716
00:47:18.236 --> 00:47:19.637
- All the other students.

717
00:47:20.872 --> 00:47:21.907
Where are they?

718
00:47:25.276 --> 00:47:28.446
(keyboard clattering)

719
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.117
- Holly. what are you doing?

720
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:33.985
It's not really the
time for studying.

721
00:47:34.052 --> 00:47:36.554
- (scoffs) I don't think
someone just broke in

722
00:47:36.554 --> 00:47:38.489
and stole the mummy.

723
00:47:38.523 --> 00:47:40.291
- What are you saying?

724
00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:41.893
- This isn't adding up.

725
00:47:41.893 --> 00:47:42.827
Just give me a sec.

726
00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:46.431
(ominous music)

727
00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:49.968
What the...

728
00:47:49.968 --> 00:47:50.768
- What is it?

729
00:47:53.905 --> 00:47:56.041
- These research assistants.

730
00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:57.242
They awoke the mummy.

731
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:59.710
- Let me see.

732
00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:04.249
- "September 4th.
2014. Reese Warrington.

733
00:48:04.282 --> 00:48:07.318
Liv Taylor and
Thomas Cook vanished

734
00:48:07.318 --> 00:48:09.254
after four of their
friends were discovered

735
00:48:09.287 --> 00:48:11.256
in the woodlands
of East England.

736
00:48:13.091 --> 00:48:14.692
The relatives of
the suspect said

737
00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:17.162
they were excited
about their findings.

738
00:48:17.162 --> 00:48:20.932
They believe they'd found a
mummy from a century in history

739
00:48:20.966 --> 00:48:22.934
which is lost with no records.

740
00:48:24.369 --> 00:48:26.972
Over 24 hours. the bodies
of the four friends

741
00:48:26.972 --> 00:48:28.506
were found nearby a site

742
00:48:28.506 --> 00:48:31.309
which looked to be for
a sacrificial ritual.

743
00:48:32.477 --> 00:48:34.745
The suspects and the
mummy were never found."

744
00:48:38.016 --> 00:48:41.119
(keyboard clattering)

745
00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:45.123
- And what does this
have to do with us?

746
00:48:45.156 --> 00:48:47.758
- (sighs) I can
feel it in my bones.

747
00:48:47.792 --> 00:48:49.160
Something isn't right here.

748
00:48:50.528 --> 00:48:52.964
- Are you sure it's that
and not what's going on?

749
00:48:54.165 --> 00:48:55.133
- What do you mean?

750
00:48:57.935 --> 00:49:00.905
- I mean. things
are tough right now.

751
00:49:00.905 --> 00:49:03.975
You might wanna go
home. get some rest.

752
00:49:04.009 --> 00:49:05.376
- Kira. I'm fine.

753
00:49:05.376 --> 00:49:08.113
(ominous music)

754
00:49:12.417 --> 00:49:14.319
- I just. I push the door and I.

755
00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:17.355
I should go straight
out to my car. right?

756
00:49:17.388 --> 00:49:18.923
- Yeah.

757
00:49:18.923 --> 00:49:22.327
- Yeah. I just push the door
and I go straight to my car.

758
00:49:22.327 --> 00:49:23.694
- Yeah. you should.

759
00:49:23.728 --> 00:49:27.132
(ominous music)

760
00:49:27.132 --> 00:49:28.833
You should walk
out the front door

761
00:49:28.833 --> 00:49:31.236
and go straight to your car.

762
00:49:31.236 --> 00:49:32.037
- Right?
- Right.

763
00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:33.038
- Right.
- Right.

764
00:49:33.038 --> 00:49:36.041
(suspenseful music)

765
00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:53.491
(footsteps tapping)

766
00:49:53.491 --> 00:49:55.126
- Oh. What the fuck?

767
00:50:08.273 --> 00:50:10.475
- Hey. guys! Welcome
back to my channel!

768
00:50:10.475 --> 00:50:12.610
Where you learn something
new with me every Monday.

769
00:50:12.643 --> 00:50:14.079
Ghost Hunter George.

770
00:50:14.079 --> 00:50:17.115
Today we're gonna be going
all the way to Egypt.

771
00:50:17.148 --> 00:50:19.650
I have a feeling you guys know
where I'm going with this.

772
00:50:19.684 --> 00:50:22.287
We are gonna be
talking about mummies.

773
00:50:22.287 --> 00:50:24.355
So without further
ado. let's get to it.

774
00:50:29.127 --> 00:50:30.628
- Where did the girls go?

775
00:50:30.695 --> 00:50:35.400
- (sighs) God. not the time
to be splitting up. ladies.

776
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.603
(ominous music)

777
00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:44.675
- Grace?

778
00:50:46.244 --> 00:50:47.044
Grace?

779
00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:55.120
Miss Mathews?

780
00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.688
What on earth is going on here?

781
00:51:28.686 --> 00:51:29.687
Miss Mathews?

782
00:51:31.189 --> 00:51:32.190
Miss Mathews?

783
00:51:32.257 --> 00:51:34.892
(ominous music)

784
00:51:36.761 --> 00:51:37.795
Miss Mathews!

785
00:51:43.868 --> 00:51:46.471
(intense music)

786
00:51:52.643 --> 00:51:55.313
(Grace snarling)

787
00:51:58.483 --> 00:52:01.118
(mummy snarling)

788
00:52:06.757 --> 00:52:07.558
Oh. God.

789
00:52:13.264 --> 00:52:16.000
(mummy growling)

790
00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:32.149
(flesh squelching)
(screaming)

791
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.685
(body thuds)

792
00:52:35.686 --> 00:52:37.588
(Martha screaming)

793
00:52:37.655 --> 00:52:40.425
(mummy snarling)

794
00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:45.796
- Okay. so one of the
most famous mummy's

795
00:52:45.796 --> 00:52:48.366
is Tutankhamun. also
known as King Tut.

796
00:52:48.366 --> 00:52:51.969
And according to legend. if
you disturb a mummy's tomb.

797
00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:53.704
it leads to death.

798
00:52:53.704 --> 00:52:55.473
That did not stop
Carter from continuing

799
00:52:55.473 --> 00:52:57.675
to explore Tut's burial ground.

800
00:52:57.708 --> 00:52:59.710
However. the media
went into a frenzy

801
00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:01.145
when they heard
that several members

802
00:53:01.212 --> 00:53:04.415
of this expedition died
early of a unnatural causes.

803
00:53:04.415 --> 00:53:08.553
However. this curse spared
Carter's life back in 1922.

804
00:53:08.553 --> 00:53:10.988
It is said that
mummies can't feel pain

805
00:53:11.055 --> 00:53:13.258
and they're usually
hard to kill.

806
00:53:13.258 --> 00:53:15.693
Now. some people might
find this hard to believe

807
00:53:15.726 --> 00:53:18.829
but mummies. they are
not just found in Egypt.

808
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:20.965
They are found all
over the world.

809
00:53:20.965 --> 00:53:23.868
In places like South
America and Europe.

810
00:53:23.934 --> 00:53:25.836
And some mummies are
intentionally preserved

811
00:53:25.836 --> 00:53:27.638
and sometimes they're
naturally preserved.

812
00:53:27.672 --> 00:53:29.774
And they can be found
in places like caves.

813
00:53:29.807 --> 00:53:31.876
deserts and all over the place.

814
00:53:31.876 --> 00:53:34.312
The most common misconception
is that people think

815
00:53:34.345 --> 00:53:36.146
that only the pharaohs
were mummified

816
00:53:36.146 --> 00:53:37.748
which is not the case at all.

817
00:53:37.815 --> 00:53:40.485
In fact. in ancient
Egypt. all the deceased

818
00:53:40.485 --> 00:53:42.887
were mummified by
their relatives.

819
00:53:42.887 --> 00:53:44.689
The difference was
only the pharaohs

820
00:53:44.722 --> 00:53:47.425
were put into sarcophaguses
in elaborate tombs.

821
00:53:47.425 --> 00:53:49.226
filled with things they
would need in the afterlife

822
00:53:49.294 --> 00:53:52.697
such as food. wine.
perfume. to name a few.

823
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:55.733
Some of them were even buried
with their pets and servants.

824
00:53:55.766 --> 00:53:57.201
However. for the poor.

825
00:53:57.201 --> 00:54:00.070
according to Egyptologist.
Salima Ikram.

826
00:54:00.104 --> 00:54:02.239
their bodies were
filled with juniper oil

827
00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:05.242
which would help dissolve
the organs before burial.

828
00:54:05.242 --> 00:54:09.013
The way that ancient
Egyptians treated a dead body

829
00:54:09.046 --> 00:54:10.515
was called mummification.

830
00:54:10.515 --> 00:54:13.117
- Holly. I feel like I'm
watching a history lesson

831
00:54:13.117 --> 00:54:16.253
- and leave a dried form.
- Bitch. watch.

832
00:54:16.287 --> 00:54:17.755
- It was so important for them

833
00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:20.558
to keep the bodies as
lifelike as possible.

834
00:54:20.591 --> 00:54:22.192
You know guys. this is so crazy.

835
00:54:22.226 --> 00:54:24.729
I mean. you could
see a mummy today.

836
00:54:24.762 --> 00:54:28.333
you know. and get a good idea
of what they would look like.

837
00:54:28.333 --> 00:54:30.768
They were buried
like 3000 years ago.

838
00:54:30.801 --> 00:54:32.870
I mean. that's totally crazy!

839
00:54:33.771 --> 00:54:36.507
(Martha panting)

840
00:54:45.249 --> 00:54:47.985
(ominous music)

841
00:54:51.956 --> 00:54:54.124
- (sighs) Thank God
it's not just us.

842
00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:56.193
- We thought we
were going crazy.

843
00:54:57.161 --> 00:55:00.197
- What the hell is going on?

844
00:55:04.168 --> 00:55:06.170
- I don't know what
I'm watching this for.

845
00:55:07.972 --> 00:55:09.374
- The lost kings.

846
00:55:09.407 --> 00:55:12.176
(ominous music)

847
00:55:13.644 --> 00:55:16.447
- It is said that the lost
kings are the most feared.

848
00:55:16.447 --> 00:55:18.115
They are said to be
erased from history

849
00:55:18.115 --> 00:55:19.917
because they dabbled
in the dark arts.

850
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:22.453
human sacrifice and evil deeds.

851
00:55:22.487 --> 00:55:24.321
They were also hidden
due to the myth

852
00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:26.323
that if you were to come
across their bodies.

853
00:55:26.357 --> 00:55:28.559
they might live again.

854
00:55:28.559 --> 00:55:30.761
They practiced the black magic.

855
00:55:30.795 --> 00:55:32.530
Their goal was to live forever.

856
00:55:32.563 --> 00:55:33.964
continue their reign.

857
00:55:33.964 --> 00:55:36.133
taking over the world.

858
00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:38.569
It is said though. that
all of the lost kings

859
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:42.407
were all taken down and
killed in one final battle.

860
00:55:42.407 --> 00:55:45.109
They were all wrapped
up. put in their tombs

861
00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:46.577
and left to die.

862
00:55:46.611 --> 00:55:47.912
But see. here's the thing.

863
00:55:47.912 --> 00:55:50.881
The tombs. they have
never been found.

864
00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:52.116
The lost king's tombs.

865
00:55:52.149 --> 00:55:54.151
no one's ever found them.

866
00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:56.086
They've never been found.
- This book.

867
00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:58.355
it mentions the lost kings.

868
00:55:58.389 --> 00:55:59.790
I think that's what we have.

869
00:56:01.125 --> 00:56:02.827
- This is a myth. Holly.

870
00:56:02.827 --> 00:56:04.328
- A myth because it's
never been found.

871
00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:06.096
- They may be responsible

872
00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:07.932
for all of terrible plague
(loud banging)

873
00:56:07.965 --> 00:56:09.066
that happened there.

874
00:56:09.066 --> 00:56:10.735
(suspenseful music)

875
00:56:10.768 --> 00:56:12.369
- Don't freak out.

876
00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:14.839
I'm sure it's nothing. There's
no mummy lurking out there.

877
00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:16.407
I'll go check. okay?

878
00:56:16.407 --> 00:56:19.410
(suspenseful music)

879
00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.361
Holly. there's nothing here.

880
00:56:46.904 --> 00:56:49.707
(Kira screaming)

881
00:56:51.776 --> 00:56:52.577
- Kira?

882
00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:05.089
(pounding on door)

883
00:57:06.323 --> 00:57:08.593
(mummy growling)

884
00:57:08.593 --> 00:57:10.995
(suspenseful music)
(pounding on door)

885
00:57:11.028 --> 00:57:13.764
(mummy growling)

886
00:57:16.834 --> 00:57:19.236
(door opens)

887
00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.375
(mummy snarling)

888
00:57:47.131 --> 00:57:47.932
(neck cracks)

889
00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:50.668
(mummy snarling)

890
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:55.973
(suspenseful music)

891
00:58:03.648 --> 00:58:05.115
(door opens)

892
00:58:05.115 --> 00:58:08.185
(suspenseful music)

893
00:58:18.162 --> 00:58:18.963
- Wait.

894
00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.131
Come on.

895
00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.169
- No. we already tried that.

896
00:58:25.202 --> 00:58:27.071
- It doesn't work.

897
00:58:27.071 --> 00:58:28.706
- What is happening?

898
00:58:30.174 --> 00:58:34.144
- Okay. I don't know. it's
like whenever we exit.

899
00:58:34.144 --> 00:58:35.713
we go back to the beginning.

900
00:58:35.713 --> 00:58:37.715
It's like a a loop or something.

901
00:58:38.883 --> 00:58:41.285
- The text. it was right.

902
00:58:43.554 --> 00:58:44.488
- What do you mean?

903
00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:46.957
- It's an ancient cast.

904
00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:52.763
We're stuck in some alter
universe of the same reality.

905
00:58:52.797 --> 00:58:54.064
Unable to escape.

906
00:58:56.601 --> 00:58:58.603
It's two in the
morning but outside.

907
00:58:58.636 --> 00:59:00.237
it's like time hasn't moved.

908
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.506
- Yeah. it's like
time's standing still.

909
00:59:02.573 --> 00:59:04.474
- Yeah. we're trapped

910
00:59:05.676 --> 00:59:07.912
in a period of time.
unable to escape it.

911
00:59:11.315 --> 00:59:15.586
- We've gotta find the others.

912
00:59:15.653 --> 00:59:16.854
- Yes.

913
00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:21.892
(intense music)
(mummy snarling)

914
00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:24.629
(Martha gasping)

915
00:59:24.629 --> 00:59:25.429
- No. no!

916
00:59:26.764 --> 00:59:29.634
(flesh squelching)

917
00:59:30.534 --> 00:59:32.069
(mummy growling)

918
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:34.839
(Martha gasping)

919
00:59:36.807 --> 00:59:41.812
(intense music)
(mummy snarling)

920
01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:02.733
- If what the book says is true.

921
01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:04.568
we awoke the money
with that chant.

922
01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:07.237
- What chant?

923
01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:09.840
I don't recall being
a part of any chant.

924
01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:14.011
- I think it was anyone in
the school or in the grounds

925
01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:15.045
when it was said.

926
01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:18.883
- I don't recall this.

927
01:00:18.883 --> 01:00:19.684
- I said it.

928
01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:23.487
"The kingdom rose.
the darkness be chose.

929
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.755
The men that see.
the men that be.

930
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:25.990
allow them to rise.

931
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:27.191
Let the dark
foreshadow the light.

932
01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:28.592
Allow him to rise."

933
01:00:31.028 --> 01:00:31.829
- Tracy.

934
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.431
Upstairs.

935
01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:36.801
She was fucked.

936
01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:38.936
- What happened?

937
01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.373
- Me and Mora.

938
01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:44.641
We were in the toilets.

939
01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:48.445
And then Tracy came in.

940
01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:53.050
She just attacked
her for no reason.

941
01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.552
She just went batshit crazy.

942
01:00:57.554 --> 01:00:59.456
Then she dragged her out.

943
01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:00.257
And then...

944
01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:03.027
Oh. God.

945
01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:04.428
- What happened?

946
01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:05.629
Where is Mora?

947
01:01:08.565 --> 01:01:10.234
- Tracy and Miss Mathews.

948
01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:12.770
they. they held her down

949
01:01:12.803 --> 01:01:15.973
and then he. the mummy. he.

950
01:01:17.808 --> 01:01:18.809
he cut her throat.

951
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:21.946
He drained her blood
like it was some ritual.

952
01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:25.950
And Tracy and Miss Matthews.

953
01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:28.719
it's like it wasn't them.

954
01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:29.920
Something about their eyes.

955
01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.891
Like there was no life in them.

956
01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:38.628
Like they've been taken over
by some sort of dark force.

957
01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:42.432
Kind of zombie-like.

958
01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:44.001
if that makes any sense.

959
01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:47.972
- That is the craziest shit
I've ever heard. but okay.

960
01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:52.309
- Look. I don't know what
the hell is going on here.

961
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:56.246
but you should've
seen their faces.

962
01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:58.048
You should have seen Mora's
eyes. they were soulless.

963
01:01:58.082 --> 01:01:59.449
It wasn't her.

964
01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:01.351
It wasn't Mora. Do
you know what I mean?

965
01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:04.188
Whatever was inside
of her. it wasn't her.

966
01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:07.357
(ominous music) I don't
want that to happen to me.

967
01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:10.494
I don't. I don't
want that to be me.

968
01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:13.831
- It won't be you. okay?

969
01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:14.631
We won't let it.

970
01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:17.334
- It was so messed up.

971
01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:18.468
She was so crazy.

972
01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.471
I'm really scared.

973
01:02:24.809 --> 01:02:25.609
- I've got it.

974
01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:30.280
He collects the souls
within the amulet

975
01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.717
and replaces them with the
dark energy from the kings.

976
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.987
- And why do they
want to do this?

977
01:02:37.054 --> 01:02:38.488
- To fulfill the prophecy.

978
01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:40.457
What they started
all those years ago.

979
01:02:41.992 --> 01:02:44.161
- Well there has to be
some way to stop it.

980
01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:50.134
- Going by this. he has 24
hours to collect the souls

981
01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:53.437
of everyone in the presence
of his resurrection.

982
01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:55.705
And if he can store the
souls within the amulet.

983
01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:59.043
then he can make
the final sacrifice.

984
01:02:59.043 --> 01:03:01.278
And that's how he'll
roam the earth forever.

985
01:03:03.247 --> 01:03:04.915
- So we just wait until sunrise?

986
01:03:05.883 --> 01:03:07.151
But it's already daylight.

987
01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:11.388
- It's sunrise within an hour.

988
01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:12.389
If my phone's right.

989
01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.525
- We're stuck in time.

990
01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:17.995
We're stuck in the moment
when the chant was said.

991
01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:21.365
- It's like we awoken him.

992
01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:22.967
And a curse has
started and we're stuck

993
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.169
in the same time
window as the curse.

994
01:03:26.971 --> 01:03:29.273
So we can't leave.

995
01:03:29.273 --> 01:03:30.474
We can't escape.

996
01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:33.277
Not until this is all over.

997
01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:37.147
- We just have to wait it out.

998
01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:42.252
- But what happens if
he manages to do it?

999
01:03:42.286 --> 01:03:44.088
- Uh. we can't let him win.

1000
01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:52.496
(intense music)
(Martha whimpering)

1001
01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:53.964
- Why are they acting like this?

1002
01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:55.265
Hey. why are their eyes black?

1003
01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.566
Why are they acting
like zombies?

1004
01:03:56.566 --> 01:04:00.270
- (whimpering)
Part of the curse.

1005
01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:02.973
An infection.

1006
01:04:03.908 --> 01:04:05.075
I don't know.

1007
01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:07.611
- Could it be like
what you said?

1008
01:04:07.644 --> 01:04:10.147
Like maybe a mummification
contamination?

1009
01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:11.548
- No.

1010
01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:13.550
We wore masks around it.

1011
01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:15.953
I don't believe
it's the same thing.

1012
01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:17.922
- Then why are people
acting like that?

1013
01:04:20.157 --> 01:04:21.425
- You have to find Holly.

1014
01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:23.593
She had the book.

1015
01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:26.696
I think the answers
are inside that book.

1016
01:04:27.631 --> 01:04:29.633
How to stop this.

1017
01:04:29.633 --> 01:04:32.469
(ominous music)

1018
01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:35.839
- Do you really think
it can be stopped?

1019
01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:40.044
- You have to translate
what's inside that book.

1020
01:04:41.045 --> 01:04:41.845
- Okay.

1021
01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:45.215
- And I believe
it can be stopped.

1022
01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:48.485
There has to be a way.

1023
01:04:51.956 --> 01:04:53.157
Ancient curses.

1024
01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:56.026
If this is a curse.

1025
01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:00.797
there will be a way to stop it.

1026
01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:03.567
(ominous music)

1027
01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:13.277
We have to figure a way out.

1028
01:05:13.277 --> 01:05:14.811
- What if he's killed everybody?

1029
01:05:17.281 --> 01:05:19.549
(door thumping)

1030
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:20.684
- Hide.

1031
01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:21.751
- No. I'm not leaving you.

1032
01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:23.253
- Do as I say!

1033
01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:24.088
Hide!

1034
01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:27.691
(suspenseful music)

1035
01:05:27.691 --> 01:05:30.427
(mummy growling)

1036
01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:38.935
(Martha gasps)

1037
01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.671
(mummy growling)

1038
01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:46.110
(Martha choking)

1039
01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:51.881
No. no!

1040
01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:55.852
(mummy snarling)

1041
01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:03.427
(Martha choking)

1042
01:06:14.871 --> 01:06:19.876
(Martha gasping)
(mummy growling)

1043
01:06:32.522 --> 01:06:35.159
(intense music)

1044
01:06:44.034 --> 01:06:46.836
(mummy growling)

1045
01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:01.185
- [Holly] We need
to find the others.

1046
01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:04.054
- If they had any sense.
they should be hiding.

1047
01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:06.156
Like we should be.

1048
01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:08.592
Yeah. or else
they've been turned.

1049
01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:10.727
Do you think they can turn back?

1050
01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.362
- What do you mean?

1051
01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.564
- Once they've been turned.

1052
01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:18.001
do you think they can
be reverted back to
the way they were?

1053
01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.636
- Well. once he has their
souls. the book read

1054
01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:21.471
as if they were gone.

1055
01:07:21.471 --> 01:07:24.308
But once he's been turned back.

1056
01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:26.476
their souls will be
free to the afterlife.

1057
01:07:26.476 --> 01:07:29.213
(ominous music)

1058
01:07:47.164 --> 01:07:49.065
- Wait. what's the plan?

1059
01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.668
- I need to know if what
that book says is true.

1060
01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:54.238
If I walk out of this building
and I come back inside.

1061
01:07:54.238 --> 01:07:57.307
then we know we can
trust what it says.

1062
01:07:57.374 --> 01:07:59.876
- Well. if that's the case.
then I'm not going in.

1063
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.811
- I'll go.

1064
01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:06.015
(growling)

1065
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:07.251
Girls. wait a minute.

1066
01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:12.256
(suspenseful music)
(growling)

1067
01:08:27.371 --> 01:08:28.272
Jessie?

1068
01:08:28.272 --> 01:08:30.507
(growling)

1069
01:08:31.908 --> 01:08:32.709
Jessie?

1070
01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:35.011
(growling)

1071
01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:48.958
(intense music)

1072
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:53.430
Jessie.

1073
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:56.233
(Jessie snarling)

1074
01:08:57.367 --> 01:08:58.168
No.

1075
01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:02.038
(Jessie snarling)

1076
01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:11.548
(Jessie snarling)

1077
01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:14.251
(intense music)

1078
01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:16.853
- What the fuck was that?

1079
01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:19.723
- I don't know. What's
happened to Jessie?

1080
01:09:19.723 --> 01:09:22.192
- I don't know.
- Oh. my God.

1081
01:09:22.226 --> 01:09:25.195
Holly. We can't just
leave her there.

1082
01:09:25.195 --> 01:09:28.198
- No. it's too dangerous.
- Look. you stay here.

1083
01:09:29.433 --> 01:09:30.434
It's going to be fine.

1084
01:09:30.434 --> 01:09:31.401
- No. Kira.
- Look. please.

1085
01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:34.404
(suspenseful music)

1086
01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:42.946
(intense music)
(mummy snarling)

1087
01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:44.881
(Kira screaming)

1088
01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:47.551
(bat whooshes and whacks)

1089
01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:49.118
(Kira gasping)

1090
01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:51.988
(flesh squelching)

1091
01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:56.893
(intense music)

1092
01:09:56.893 --> 01:09:59.629
(bones cracking)

1093
01:10:04.968 --> 01:10:07.604
(feet stomping)

1094
01:10:10.274 --> 01:10:15.279
(mummy snarling)
(feet stomping)

1095
01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:20.284
(Lyne whimpering)

1096
01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:31.428
(suspenseful music)

1097
01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:33.630
(snarling)

1098
01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:51.448
(snarling)

1099
01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:05.161
(snarling)

1100
01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:20.377
(suspenseful music)

1101
01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:39.496
(door knob clattering)

1102
01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:40.330
- Damn!

1103
01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.536
(gasping)

1104
01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:55.479
(Lyne panting)

1105
01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:09.025
- Are you here for detention?

1106
01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:11.895
(Lyne gasping)

1107
01:12:11.895 --> 01:12:12.896
(snarling)

1108
01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:14.163
(ominous music)

1109
01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.933
(mummy growling)

1110
01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:28.612
(Lyne choking)

1111
01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:33.483
(bones cracking)

1112
01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:49.365
(suspenseful music)

1113
01:12:52.268 --> 01:12:54.871
(clock ticking)

1114
01:13:03.513 --> 01:13:06.950
(door creaking)
(intense music)

1115
01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:09.753
(mummy growling)

1116
01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:24.934
(door creaking)

1117
01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.572
(shrieking)

1118
01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:43.186
(Mark grunting)

1119
01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.053
- Holly?

1120
01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:47.056
Holly? Wake up.

1121
01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:51.561
(ominous music)

1122
01:13:52.696 --> 01:13:54.664
Holly. come on.

1123
01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:56.933
(grunting)

1124
01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.271
That's it. Come on.

1125
01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:03.640
Holly?

1126
01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.440
Holly?

1127
01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:10.146
- Mark.

1128
01:14:10.213 --> 01:14:12.616
Holly. are your ropes loose?

1129
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:13.850
We gotta get outta here.

1130
01:14:16.486 --> 01:14:19.689
(Holly whimpering)

1131
01:14:19.723 --> 01:14:21.591
- They're not. they're not.

1132
01:14:21.591 --> 01:14:22.759
I can't. I can't.

1133
01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.896
- What the hell are they doing?

1134
01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:29.666
(both grunting)

1135
01:14:33.737 --> 01:14:35.371
- It's the final sacrifice.

1136
01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.274
In order for the
mummy to fully rise.

1137
01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.276
he has to collect the
souls of everyone present

1138
01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:41.277
at his resurrection.

1139
01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:43.913
Then he can make
the final sacrifice

1140
01:14:43.947 --> 01:14:45.481
and then he can be reborn.

1141
01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:48.885
- What's the final sacrifice?

1142
01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:51.087
(ominous music)

1143
01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:52.889
- Consumption of a human heart.

1144
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.892
and to be reborn in human flesh.

1145
01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:57.727
- Oh God.

1146
01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:00.196
He's gonna use us. isn't he?

1147
01:15:01.464 --> 01:15:02.999
- To be reborn.

1148
01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:04.233
(clock ticking)

1149
01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.936
(both grunting)

1150
01:15:13.677 --> 01:15:15.078
- I can't get it.

1151
01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:17.280
(clock ticking)

1152
01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.815
- It's two minutes till dawn.

1153
01:15:20.684 --> 01:15:21.651
We're stuck in the time

1154
01:15:21.685 --> 01:15:23.352
that the resurrection was done.

1155
01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:27.591
So if he can't make
the final sacrifice.

1156
01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:32.028
then he can't me reborn.

1157
01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.396
- So we either get
out of these ropes

1158
01:15:33.396 --> 01:15:35.832
in the next two minutes or...

1159
01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:36.666
- Or he's reborn.

1160
01:15:37.634 --> 01:15:40.003
(intense music)
(Mark grunting)

1161
01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:45.008
(mummy growling)
(bones cracking)

1162
01:15:49.913 --> 01:15:51.114
- Oh my God.
(Holly sobbing)

1163
01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:54.350
(mummy snarling)

1164
01:15:54.417 --> 01:15:56.920
Hey. get the hell
away from here. huh?

1165
01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.656
(mummy growling)

1166
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:02.759
(Holly mumbling)

1167
01:16:02.759 --> 01:16:04.393
I don't know.

1168
01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:05.228
No!
- No!

1169
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:08.965
We have just over a minute!

1170
01:16:08.965 --> 01:16:10.634
- Hey. hey!
- No!

1171
01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:12.068
- Hey. look at me!
- No!

1172
01:16:12.135 --> 01:16:13.136
Look at me!

1173
01:16:13.136 --> 01:16:18.074
(intense music)
(both grunting)

1174
01:16:23.212 --> 01:16:27.516
(mummy growling)
Oh. Jesus!

1175
01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:28.317
- Oh. no!

1176
01:16:31.054 --> 01:16:33.790
(mummy snarling)

1177
01:16:38.561 --> 01:16:41.497
(Holly whimpering)

1178
01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:44.801
(Holly gasping)

1179
01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:46.002
- Hey. over here!

1180
01:16:46.002 --> 01:16:47.937
You ugly motherfucker
piece of shit!

1181
01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:49.272
Hey! Hey. buddy!

1182
01:16:50.874 --> 01:16:52.575
(Holly screaming)
No!

1183
01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.311
(mummy growling)

1184
01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.393
Hey. look at me. buddy!

1185
01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:11.895
Hey. I think you need
some more straps.

1186
01:17:11.928 --> 01:17:13.697
You're shit's looking real dry!

1187
01:17:13.697 --> 01:17:15.331
(Holly screaming)
No!

1188
01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:20.369
(intense music)
(clock ticking)

1189
01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:22.305
Look over here!

1190
01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:24.440
No!
(mummy snarling)

1191
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.575
(knife thuds)

1192
01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:29.245
(intense music)

1193
01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:35.084
(mummy growling)

1194
01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:38.287
(bones cracking)

1195
01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:39.889
(Holly gasping)

1196
01:17:39.923 --> 01:17:44.928
(feet stomping)
(mummy growling)

1197
01:17:56.706 --> 01:17:59.642
(snarling)

1198
01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:00.844
Into this kind of thing. guys.

1199
01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:02.511
but you're ugly
as shit right now.

1200
01:18:02.545 --> 01:18:03.713
Oh my God!

1201
01:18:03.713 --> 01:18:05.882
(gasping)

1202
01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:12.655
(clock ticking)

1203
01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:15.391
(mummy snarling)

1204
01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:23.166
20 seconds. Holly!

1205
01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.003
(clock ticking)

1206
01:18:27.003 --> 01:18:29.705
(mummy growling)

1207
01:18:32.976 --> 01:18:34.443
Five. four. three.

1208
01:18:36.112 --> 01:18:36.913
two. one!

1209
01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:43.452
(mummy groaning)
(bones cracking)

1210
01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:54.530
(all gasping)

1211
01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.966
(Mark laughing)

1212
01:18:56.966 --> 01:18:59.969
Whoo! (breathes heavily)

1213
01:18:59.969 --> 01:19:04.874
(soft piano music)
(Holly whimpering)

1214
01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:14.550
- Who's your mummy now?

1215
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:16.886
(chuckling)

1216
01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:27.330
- Oh. oh. God. (laughing)

1217
01:19:27.363 --> 01:19:29.365
Get these things off me.

1218
01:19:31.034 --> 01:19:32.201
Oh. thank you.

1219
01:19:36.039 --> 01:19:38.808
(both chuckling)

1220
01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:44.647
- He's vanquished.

1221
01:19:44.647 --> 01:19:45.714
- Oh. he's vanquished. is he?

1222
01:19:45.748 --> 01:19:48.384
(both laughing)

1223
01:19:50.954 --> 01:19:51.754
- Should we-
- Let's get the hell

1224
01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:52.588
out of here.

1225
01:19:53.857 --> 01:19:56.592
(both chuckling)

1226
01:19:57.927 --> 01:20:02.932
(bright music)
(birds chirping)

1227
01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.871
- No one's ever
gonna believe us.

1228
01:20:07.937 --> 01:20:08.704
- No.

1229
01:20:08.771 --> 01:20:11.407
(both laughing)

1230
01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:14.310
(phone vibrating)

1231
01:20:15.611 --> 01:20:17.213
- Mom?

1232
01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:19.148
Hi. I'm coming home.

1233
01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:20.283
We're coming right now.

1234
01:20:32.628 --> 01:20:33.897
- So what was it I said?

1235
01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:35.798
- I don't know.
apparently somebody said

1236
01:20:35.798 --> 01:20:39.235
that they think they saw a
mummy or something like that.

1237
01:20:39.268 --> 01:20:41.137
- Well a bunch of kids were
found brutally murdered.

1238
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.006
Yeah?
- Yeah.

1239
01:20:43.006 --> 01:20:45.608
And some friends
apparently got some weapons

1240
01:20:45.641 --> 01:20:48.311
and started bumping off
each other and all that.

1241
01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:51.447
Some sort of a Battle
Royale or something.

1242
01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:52.882
- You don't think...

1243
01:20:52.916 --> 01:20:55.184
- What. that the mummy did it?

1244
01:20:56.652 --> 01:20:57.453
- Come on now.

1245
01:20:58.654 --> 01:21:01.290
- Wait. we're gonna go
in the room in a moment

1246
01:21:01.324 --> 01:21:02.691
and collect that thing.

1247
01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:03.893
Get it together. mate.

1248
01:21:03.927 --> 01:21:06.095
- I mean. I believe
in that sort of stuff.

1249
01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:08.331
- Mummy's walking around.
the undead rising.

1250
01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.333
zombies and all that?

1251
01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:12.235
No. I don't mate.

1252
01:21:12.235 --> 01:21:15.271
- They found the inconsistencies
with the victim's bodies.

1253
01:21:15.304 --> 01:21:16.839
- How so?

1254
01:21:16.839 --> 01:21:19.275
- Well. they think
someone involved escaped.

1255
01:21:19.308 --> 01:21:20.643
Who had something to with it.

1256
01:21:20.643 --> 01:21:21.877
- I'm telling you. mate.

1257
01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:23.512
It's that girl.

1258
01:21:23.512 --> 01:21:24.948
All right? And her friend.

1259
01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:26.415
All right?

1260
01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:28.551
She's the one who's doing
all this crazy shit.

1261
01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:30.053
I mean. seriously
there were saying

1262
01:21:30.086 --> 01:21:32.688
that she was part of a devil
worshiping cult or something.

1263
01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:34.157
- She seems so normal.

1264
01:21:34.157 --> 01:21:35.391
- So was my last bird.

1265
01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:38.194
- Yeah. but seriously. though.

1266
01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:40.129
she was just a student.

1267
01:21:40.163 --> 01:21:41.965
No. they couldn't have
done this to each other.

1268
01:21:42.798 --> 01:21:44.400
The way no one called the cops.

1269
01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.202
No one tried to escape.

1270
01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:48.671
And the police just said
that the doors were all open.

1271
01:21:48.704 --> 01:21:50.239
- I mean. are you
listening to me?

1272
01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:52.041
Kids are thick. all right?

1273
01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:55.544
- I don't think it was them.

1274
01:21:55.611 --> 01:21:57.046
- Then who?

1275
01:21:57.046 --> 01:21:58.314
- Come on.

1276
01:21:58.347 --> 01:21:59.348
The mummy.

1277
01:22:00.883 --> 01:22:02.118
I'm serious. I'm telling you.

1278
01:22:02.118 --> 01:22:03.186
I've heard stories
like this before.

1279
01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:04.687
- Where? From what?

1280
01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:07.490
"England's Most
Haunted Shit Stories?"

1281
01:22:07.523 --> 01:22:09.125
- No. but seriously. though.

1282
01:22:09.158 --> 01:22:11.394
If that thing did do it.

1283
01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:12.996
we're about to be touching him.

1284
01:22:14.163 --> 01:22:16.199
- Then we better not
wake him up then.

1285
01:22:16.232 --> 01:22:20.169
Come on.

1286
01:22:20.203 --> 01:22:22.838
(clock ticking)

1287
01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:28.077
(ominous music)

1288
01:22:32.348 --> 01:22:33.816
Look at that.

1289
01:22:33.849 --> 01:22:34.650
Huh.

1290
01:22:40.323 --> 01:22:41.357
Get me a photo of it.

1291
01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:44.893
- Really?
- Come on. mate.

1292
01:22:44.927 --> 01:22:47.396
How often do you get
that close to a mummy?

1293
01:22:49.565 --> 01:22:50.566
Come.

1294
01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:52.768
(ominous music)
(clock ticking)

1295
01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:53.769
- Say. cheese!

1296
01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:00.576
- Well mate. it's too blurred.

1297
01:23:02.345 --> 01:23:04.647
- No. look. Come on.
let's just get this done.

1298
01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:05.948
Get the mummy out of
here and let's go.

1299
01:23:06.015 --> 01:23:08.451
Please.
- Come on one more. please.

1300
01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:09.652
- No.

1301
01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.354
I just wanna go home.

1302
01:23:11.354 --> 01:23:12.455
Do you know what?
- Come on. mate.

1303
01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:13.956
- You can deal with this.

1304
01:23:13.956 --> 01:23:17.026
I'll meet you back in the van.
- Well don't be a prude.

1305
01:23:17.093 --> 01:23:17.893
Tosser.

1306
01:23:19.962 --> 01:23:21.130
(door closes)

1307
01:23:21.164 --> 01:23:22.131
(ominous music)
(clock ticking)

1308
01:23:22.131 --> 01:23:23.632
Say. cheese.

1309
01:23:23.632 --> 01:23:26.435
(shutter clicks)

1310
01:23:26.469 --> 01:23:27.270
Well I like that.

1311
01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:29.105
Oh.

1312
01:23:33.376 --> 01:23:36.645
That is my housing
deposit sorted. there.

1313
01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:40.116
Quite a pussy magnet.

1314
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:42.885
(intense music)

1315
01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:50.759
You don't smell that bad.

1316
01:23:50.793 --> 01:23:52.561
(mummy growling)

1317
01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:55.364
(man choking)

1318
01:23:55.398 --> 01:23:56.399
(neck snapping)

1319
01:23:56.399 --> 01:23:57.366
(body thudding)

1320
01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:59.568
(intense music)

1321
01:23:59.602 --> 01:24:04.473
(mummy growling)
(bones cracking)

1322
01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:16.885
(ominous music)

1323
01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:40.209
- Stop messing about. all right?

1324
01:24:40.243 --> 01:24:41.277
It's not funny.

1325
01:24:41.277 --> 01:24:43.912
(intense music)

1326
01:24:47.716 --> 01:24:52.054
You know how much shit we
can get in for this. right?

1327
01:24:55.424 --> 01:25:00.396
(bones cracking)
(zombie growling)

1328
01:25:05.634 --> 01:25:06.635
(object whacks)

1329
01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:09.372
(mummy snarling)

1330
01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:16.145
(mummy growling)
(feet stomping)

1331
01:25:16.145 --> 01:25:18.881
No. no. no. no. please!

1332
01:25:18.881 --> 01:25:20.683
Please. no. don't. no!

1333
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:23.118
(mummy growls)

1334
01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:24.353
(sword scrapes)
(man screams)

1335
01:25:24.387 --> 01:25:27.055
(intense music)

1336
01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:43.966
(static buzzing)
