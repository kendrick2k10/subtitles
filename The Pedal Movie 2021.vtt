00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:17.350
she's 89 years old.
and I had to explain to her.
what's a pedal board.

5
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.520
I tried to explain to her
that basically electric guitar

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.290
was never engineered to sound
different from acoustic guitars.

7
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.192
It was only engineered
to sound louder.

8
00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.561
All the different flavors
that we get from guitars

9
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:32.032
has historically evolved
through these things
called effect pedals.

10
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.770
This external device
is like the go between
the guitar and the amp.

11
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.709
And it's normal to have
six to ten little boxes like.
all neatly packed into a system.

12
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.677
It's just more colors
for the guitar.

13
00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:47.147
and sometimes that changes
the type of music you play.

14
00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.582
and sometimes that's just gets
in the way of playing music.

15
00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:53.586

[mellow music playing]

18
00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:55.615
I think ever since musical
instruments were first used.

19
00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:59.352
they have been an extension of
people's power of expression.

20
00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:03.490
And they have always used
the technology available
in the times.

21
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.760
whether it was a...
a piece of bone or a log.
or something.

22
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.598
or electronic or complicated
string instruments.

23
00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:13.666
[Andrew] You have to go back
all the way to the beginning.

24
00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.436
even in classical music
where there was no electronics.

25
00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:20.173
but they wanted to modify
the sound of the instrument.

26
00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:23.510
So to me. the first pedal was
the pedal on the piano

27
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.348
that you made it to sustain
so you could hit like a chord.
you hold the pedal down.

28
00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.650
So. it's like a
mechanical device.

29
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.686
that is. modifies the sound
and give you more expression.

30
00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:37.657
Well. the history of effects.
I mean. people have always
wanted to alter their sound.

31
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.827
I mean.
if you look at the way keyboard
instruments evolved.

32
00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:44.497
I mean. people looked upon
the... the piano forte

33
00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:47.500
as this incredibly weird thing
the same way.
people look at samplers

34
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.936
when they first came out
or something. you know.
you had clavichords.

35
00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.539
and you had some Balos.
and... and all these different
instruments.

36
00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.376
And then people started
making modifications to those.

37
00:02:56.376 --> 00:03:00.647
[Andrew] And even on trumpets.
they have that mute
that is like a little cap.

38
00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:03.516
So. when you did this.
wa. wa. wa.

39
00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.952
you can hear that
like an old jazz recordings.

40
00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:08.221
but they wanted to
modify the sound.

41
00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:10.423
give another expression today
[inaudible].

42
00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:12.859
So finally.
when the electronics arrived

43
00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.428
then you could plug in
your guitar

44
00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.931
then immediately people
start to think about. yeah.

45
00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.600
how can I take it
to the next level?

46
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.469
[Mike]    With electronics.
there was a period of...

47
00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.407
growth and diversification
of using effects.

48
00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:32.745
And then there was
the increasing notion
that effects are instruments.

49
00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:35.381
[reel whirring]

50
00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.920
[clicks]

51
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.558
The history of pedals starts in
1931 with the electric guitar.

52
00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.728
Without an electric guitar
you don't need pedals.

53
00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.464
They started making
modifications to
the guitar itself.

54
00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:53.299
They added pickups.
They had amps.

55
00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.935
[Albini] Things like.
tone controls. and equalizers.

56
00:03:55.935 --> 00:04:00.974
compressors and limiters.
those were also developed fairly
early in the electronic era.

57
00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:04.744
You could consider those special
effects. but I consider those
more corrective devices.

58
00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:08.781
I suppose. perhaps.
the first special effect
would be reverb or echo

59
00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:11.351
because when you play in a room.
you hear the ambient effect.

60
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.921
I suppose that would qualify
as a special effect. but
that's an acoustic phenomenon.

61
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:20.727
["Peg O' My Heart" by Jerry
Murad's Harmonicats playing]

62
00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:28.501
There were a lot
of accidental effects as well.

63
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:30.770
A piece of equipment
would be working incorrectly.

64
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.906
There'd be like a...
a bad junction. uh.
on the vacuum tubes.

65
00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.409
The vacuum tube
would instead of behaving
like an amplifier

66
00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.345
would behave like
a diode and you'd get a...
a fuzzing effect.

67
00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:43.883
It's somebody using something
where they stumble
across some sound

68
00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:47.020
and find sort of a musical
use for it. you know.

69
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.058
where it's sort of
a broken speaker or
sort of turning the tone knob.

70
00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:54.994
you know. to create
sort of a moving filter.

71

[upbeat music playing]

72
00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:10.376
And then ultimately coming up
with some mechanical device

73
00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:13.046
that would turn
that tone knob for you.

74
00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:16.482
The earliest guitar effect
is the DeArmond Tremolo.

75
00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:19.319
It has a motor in it.
really safe contraption

when you combine electricity
with fluid moving
around inside of it.

77
00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:26.926
We used a little cylinder
of an electrolyte fluid

78
00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:31.764
and shook it back and forth
to make and break a connection.
to make a tremolo sound.

of the history of effects

82
00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:56.989
because so much of it
was people throwing things
together. uh. for their own rig.

83

practical use of echo

[Adrian] In the 1950s.
music tastes started to shift.

91
00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:37.797
There was a new type of music
on the block called
rock 'n' roll.

It was given birth
to from blues and jazz
that had gone before it.

93

Artists such as Link Wray were
doing things like cranking their
amplifiers to induce distortion.

slashing their speaker cones.
putting holes in them

towards different sounds

102

and experimentation in music
that created the necessity
for effects pedals.

Daddy was really. really
interested in transistors.

134
00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:47.820
And he had ordered books on
transistors. and learned about
the transistors and...

135
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.592
Transistors are small electronic
devices...

136
00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:56.729
and they were designed
to supersede valves and tubes.

137
00:09:56.729 --> 00:10:00.266
But. in the early days
in the 1960s.

138
00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:06.906
transistors were predominantly
used for amplification purposes.

139
00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:12.912
A small signal. such as you get
from a guitar. would be played.

140
00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:15.348
pushed through
to the effects pedal.

141
00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:19.251
and amplified
by the first transistor.

142
00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:22.088
It would then roll
from that transistor.

143
00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:27.159
and then roll through to another
transistor. and then that signal
again would be amplified.

144
00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:32.965
You would end up with.
in these designs.
a fuzz circuit. uh.

"Well. that's it.

disasters into something
that's positive.

started.

162
00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:47.873
'cause they didn't have
horn players.

163
00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:51.844
It's very easy to say.
that it would not have been
that successful

164
00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:54.113
if it wasn't for
The Rolling Stones.

165
00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:57.083
Indeed. history tells us
that basically.

166
00:11:57.083 --> 00:12:00.720
they sold out
all of those pedals worldwide

167
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.156
as a direct consequence of
that song hitting the airwaves.

168
00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:08.928
It pushed other designers
to make fuzz.

169
00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:12.398
Essentially. the Maestro laid
the foundations
for what was to come.

170
00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:16.802
[upbeat music playing]

171
00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:21.874
[man 2]    In 1965.
later in that year. you have
Denmark Street in London.

172
00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:24.243
That Maestro
pedal makes its way over.

173
00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:27.847
Only a few guys have them
in London. the Beatles.
people like that.

174
00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:32.985
The guy walks in to Macari's
instrument exchange
on Denmark Street.

175
00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:35.454
[Adrian] Who are Macari's?

176
00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:40.860
They're a legendary shop
run by legendary people.
making legendary things.

177
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.130
and have had a massive and
profound effect on our industry.

178
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.532
so. overall legends.

179
00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:50.870
[Gary]    This was all down
to Vic Flick. who was
the James Bond guitar man.

180
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.305
And he came in one day
with a Maestro Fuzz-Tone.

181
00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:57.376
can you check this out
and do some... something
a little bit better with it?

182
00:12:57.376 --> 00:12:59.779
It's not giving me
a good enough sound.

183
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:04.049
It's just this little short
burping sound
and I want a long sustain.

184
00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:06.819
So I tried it out for him.
and I couldn't really do
anything with it.

185
00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:10.990
And I said. leave it with me
and I'll work on it.
and I'll do you something.

186
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.527
Um. you know. develop.
run. which I did.
and I built him a Tone Bender.

187
00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:19.231
[heavy distortion playing]

188
00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:41.520
[Gary]    Jimmy Page.
and Jeff Beck.
and Spencer Davis. Manfred Mann.

189
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.590
all the names. you name it.
they had it. you know.
at that time.

190
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.193
[AnthonIt's the one that
Pete Townshend got hold of.

191
00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:48.961
I don't think.
he liked it very much

192
00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.297
because he gave it
to Mick Ronson.

193
00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:53.866
And of course.
it became the signature

194
00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:57.136
Bowie sound on virtually
every bit of distortion
on Bowie records.

195
00:13:57.136 --> 00:14:01.974
It's one of these. so...
It is really like the holy grail
of fuzz boxes

196
00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:04.376
along with this.
which is the MK II.

197
00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:07.613
and this... this came
along six months later.

198
00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:10.015
This has been used
all over the place.

199
00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:13.586
but most famously is.
the Led Zeppelin
Jimmy Page pedal.

200
00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:16.155
So. the product
is kind of important.

201
00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:19.458
but what's most important
are these guys getting hold
of it and going. boof.

202
00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:22.027
this is what's going on.

203
00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:27.099
And basically. at that time.
'65. there was nothing
so. everybody had a Tone Bender.

204
00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:30.936
[AnthonIt was a catalyst
for everyone to suddenly
want this fuzz sound.

205
00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:32.938
And right then there was only
one place they could get it.

206
00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:35.941
I mean. it must have
been... must've been incredible.

207
00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:41.213
And I built another version
for Marshall.
which was the super-fast.

208
00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:46.018
And all the other companies
in England actually had
Tone Bender-based fuzz boxes.

209
00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:50.155
like. Rotosound.
Barnes & Mullins. Hornby Skewes.

210
00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:52.458
all the old manufacturers
or importers

211
00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:56.929
as they were had these pedals
modified in some way or another.

212
00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:58.430
Labels and music instrument
companies.

213
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.466
people like that. didn't know.

214
00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:02.968
what the hell a fuzz
was even supposed to sound like.

215
00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:06.005
you know. they're literally
inventing like.
what rock 'n' roll became

216
00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:07.573
because no one even knew.
what the hell were...

217
00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.541
that they were trying
to accomplish other than. well.

218
00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:12.111
it needs to be louder and it
needs to be more aggressive.

219
00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:18.117
[rock music playing]

220
00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:21.120
[Craig] That gave birth to the
guitar solo in a lot of ways.

221
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.255
If you listen back
to the early days

222
00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:26.492
of The British Invasion
or Buddy Holly.
or people like that.

223
00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:29.361
The solos tended to be fairly
economical. you know.

224
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:32.031
quite short. and so.
there weren't really tambour.

225
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.033
They were all treated
from a melodic standpoint.

226
00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:37.136
Effects made the solos possible
from a tambour standpoint.

227
00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:41.040
So. you have this significant
kind of ironic moment

228
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.946
where an American accident
in a country music studio
creates an effect pedal.

229
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:51.617
which then is used
by a British man. ends up
on Denmark Street in London.

230
00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:54.253
and is turned
into the Tone Bender.

231
00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:58.724
which then gives us
everything from
The Yardbirds to Led Zeppelin.

232
00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:03.696
That's probably
the most important moment
in effects pedal history.

233
00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:06.065
Because in 1966.

234
00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:10.169
Arbiter takes
the Tone Bender 1.5
and made the Fuzz Face.

235
00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:14.707
[distorted music playing]

236
00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:29.488
[Morgan] The Fuzz Face...

237
00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:33.625
the one pedal that's made.
like. a million different
variations of it.

238
00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:39.131
It's literally like.
a little blurb out
of an RCA transistor manual.

239
00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:41.500
and some dude decided
to make it.

240
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.236
[Jeorge] I'm a Fuzz Face
fanatic. I love Fuzz Faces.

241
00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:46.005
A Fuzz Face is an instrument.

242
00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:48.774
so. you play to it
and that's what's really fun.

243
00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:51.110
It's very dynamic
and interactive.

244
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.178
and... and you can get all
sorts of crazy stuff from it.

245
00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.646
And that's how Hendrix used it.

246
00:16:54.646 --> 00:17:01.754
[rock music playing]

247
00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:10.195
In the '60s.
guitar was hugely popular.

248
00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:14.233
but it had reached kind of a.
um... kind of a plateau.

249
00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:17.603
I think. with a lot of pop bands
doing kind of the same thing.

250
00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:20.572
And then. of course.
Jimi Hendrix came along.

251
00:17:20.572 --> 00:17:22.641
The Fuzz Face is a big one.

252
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:25.244
You know. Jimi Hendrix has used
that and changed everything.

253
00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:27.312
Jimi Hendrix.
started it all. right?

254
00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:28.781
It all started with Jimi.

255
00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.516
He set a standard
in guitar playing

256
00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:32.718
that was heavily dependent
on effects.

257
00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.154
And even in the studio
where he did the flanging things

258
00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:37.056
with... with Eddie Kramer
and all that.

259
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.457
That was... that was a big deal.

260
00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:40.325
Well. certainly
Jimi's pedals were tweaked.

261
00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:42.161
There's no question.

262
00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:44.563
Um. Roger Mayer would get
in there with a screwdriver.

263
00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:47.800
take it all apart and mess
with the resistors.

264
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.668
and put different
little transistors in.

265
00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:52.538
and then it would be super-hot.

266
00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:55.274
[man 3] So. Roger Mayer is.

267
00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:59.411
I would class him probably
as one of those legends
of the effects pedal industry.

268
00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:03.549
During the 1960s.
he was working
for the British Navy.

269
00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:09.321
the Admiralty. as it was. uh.
conducting underwater research.

270
00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:13.392
It was during this time that
he was going to a fair few gigs.

271
00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:17.729
And it was at one gig.
that he actually met Jimmy Page.

272
00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:20.532
Jimmy Page. asked him.
to solve a problem

273
00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:25.804
which was to allow him
to have more distortion.
but with more sustain.

274
00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:29.374
Roger went away.
produced the device.

275
00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:34.780
which as legend goes. Jimmy
loved and used prolifically.

276
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.516
Roger also created
another device.

277
00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:40.185
We now know it as the Octavia.

278
00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:44.223
He went to another gig
and spoke to another legendary
guitarist called. Jimi Hendrix.

279
00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:49.828
[rock music playing]

280
00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:53.265
[Vai]    Hendrix reportedly.
you know. gets this prototype.

281
00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:56.468
runs and tracks some of
the solos on this debut record.

282
00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:58.904
You know. even like Purple Haze.
for instance. uh.

283
00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:03.308
where I think. that's an Octavia
where you're listening.
oh. what is that?

284
00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:08.647
It's a type of fuzz
that takes the... the wave
form and folds it over.

285
00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:11.183
and creates an octave up effect.

286
00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:15.521
You know. when they talk about
time travel and poking holes
in the paper.

287
00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:17.356
it's kind of a fuzz
that does that.

288
00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:20.659
Roger. I think. quit his job
at the Admiralty.

289
00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:24.229
and went on tour
with Jimi Hendrix.

290
00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:28.300
But he was described
as Jimi Hendrix's secret weapon

291
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:34.506
because he essentially modified
and serviced all of Jimi's amps
and effects

292
00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:37.576
which obviously got abused
on a daily basis.

293
00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:42.581
It's like everything that
is Hendrix was handed to him
at the moment it was invented.

294
00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:46.385
We tend to just think. like.
Jimi Hendrix was
a killer guitar player

295
00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:48.487
and he just went to the store
and found all this stuff.

296
00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:51.290
but it's more like these pedals
found him.

297
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:55.294
So. you have this really
wild chain of events.

298
00:19:55.294 --> 00:20:01.567
three fuzz pedals
creating genres in music within
just a span of a few years.

299
00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:08.407
These early fuzzes.
part of why they sound so unique

300
00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:13.879
is that the part itself that is
fueling the circuit is so bad.

301
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:18.617
The germanium
transistor is inconsistent.
It's unpredictable.

302
00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:21.753
It's your worst nightmare.
if you're a circuit designer.

303
00:20:21.753 --> 00:20:25.357
So. as quickly as that part
could be done away with it was.

304
00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:29.494
rightly so.
and you see the first silicon
fuzzes come into play.

305
00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:34.233
The Arbiter Fuzz Faces start
using BC108 transistors. BC109s.

306
00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:37.269
This is what Hendrix really used
more than anything.

307
00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:39.938
and Roger Mayer's designs
incorporated these.

308
00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:43.242
You see the Tone Benders
go to silicon.

309
00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:46.712
In 1969 though.
you see the Big Muff.

310
00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:48.914
[distorted music playing]

311
00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.483
[Johnny] My favorite pedal
maker?
Yeah. Mike Matthews by far.

312
00:20:51.483 --> 00:20:52.584
Absolutely.

313
00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:54.253
How do you not love that guy?

314
00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.622
He's a crazy man.

315
00:20:56.622 --> 00:21:00.025
If you want to talk about
the mad professor.
that's Mike Matthews.

316
00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:03.762
Mike is quite
a force to be reckoned with.

317
00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:07.666
And he doesn't even play guitar.
like. he plays piano.

318
00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:13.005
And still he's responsible
for so much of what we're doing
in the industry to-date.

319
00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:19.578
[soft music playing]

320
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.815
[ZacharThere's only one.
He's a god.

321
00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:27.352
To his company he said was
born in a cloud of pot smoke.

322
00:21:27.352 --> 00:21:29.588
He was having a conversation
with his wife

323
00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:31.990
and decided he was gonna
just start a pedal company.

324
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.727
[Mike Matthews]    Well. uh.
while I was in college.

325
00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:38.297
after my sophomore year
with a friend.

326
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:41.833
I started promoting big name
rock 'n' roll acts
in the summer.

327
00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:47.839
Coasters. The Drifters.
Shirelles. The Rascals.
The Byrds. Chuck Berry.

328
00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:51.910
With Chuck Berry. he traveled
alone. so. the promoter
had to get the band.

329
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.513
My band was more straight.
hard-hitting R&B.

330
00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:57.015
So. I got them to back up
Chuck Berry.

331
00:21:57.015 --> 00:21:59.685
and I played keyboards on the...
on the concert with Chuck Berry.
It was two dates.

332
00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:02.020
And then the promoter
who sold me Chuck Berry...

333
00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:04.856
he called me up a week
before the date.

334
00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:06.825
He says. "Mike.
I need you to do me a favor.

335
00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.493
I need... I got this band.

336
00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:10.329
They're...
they're... they're great.

337
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:11.963
They're... you need to
take them for three nights."

338
00:22:11.963 --> 00:22:14.800
That other band was
Curtis Knight and the Squires.

339
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.337
And the guitar player
that he said was amazing
was Jimmy James.

340
00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:20.872
But Jimmy James eventually
became Jimi Hendrix.

341
00:22:20.872 --> 00:22:24.943
and me and Jimi became
real good. real best friends
for... for a couple of years.

342
00:22:24.943 --> 00:22:29.548
The hottest thing in pedals was.
uh. Fuzz Tones.

343
00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:33.652
Uh. Al Dronge. who
is the founder of Guild Guitars
wanted to sell fuzz tones.

344
00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:37.756
So I'd go... I build them up.
and this was while
I was still working for IBM.

345
00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:41.727
But then. that's just.
when Jimi Hendrix became hot.

346
00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:45.630
and everybody then wanted
to play like Jimi Hendrix.

347
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.700
and Jimi was just vibrating
his finger and the guitar
would sing forever.

348
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.604
So. everybody wanted
what they thought was. like.
this distortion free sustaining.

349
00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:55.440
And that would go up to 10
but. I mean.

350
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.577
if you could turn it up to 30.
that's when it would. might
start to overdrive and distort.

351
00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:04.483
But with the LPB-1.
all of a sudden.
all amps were much louder.

352
00:23:04.483 --> 00:23:10.522
[rock music playing]

353
00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:14.960
[Mike] So. the LPB-1
was my first product
under the Electro-Harmonix name.

354
00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:20.699
So. in that same box.
I just changed
two of the capacitor values.

355
00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:24.669
and we had a treble booster
which was called
the Screaming Bird.

356
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:29.808
And then we also had
a bass booster. also changing
some capacitors called the Mole.

357
00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:33.578
And then we had.
I made a little older drive
distortion unit

358
00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:36.915
and had a muffled sound called.
so. I called that the Muff Fuzz.

359
00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:42.087
And then later on.
we developed a more complex
distortion unit.

360
00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:43.822
and I really fiddled around
with that.

361
00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:46.191
It had these multiple stages.

362
00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:51.797
and I carefully rolled off
the tones
and that became the Big Muff.

363
00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:58.837
[rock music playing]

364
00:23:58.837 --> 00:24:02.040
[Billy] There the sound of.
like. the greatest amp ever.

365
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.010
and the greatest guitar ever
cranked to 147

366
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.712
and you're playing on the moon.
right?

367
00:24:07.712 --> 00:24:12.551
But you got to find this exact
right fit tonally. where you get
enough low-high combination.

368
00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:14.553
You get the attack.
you get the subs.

369
00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:16.521
and that's what I always love
about this Big Muff sound.

370
00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:18.590
It's like... it kind of gives me
everything

371
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.226
I want as a guitar player
in sort of one mashed-up sound.

372
00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:24.596
And I love it 'cause
it says it's a distortion pedal.

373
00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:27.499
It's like a different word.

374
00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:30.535
You could play the same riff
through them and your attitude
will change playing to that box.

375
00:24:30.535 --> 00:24:34.673
It's a more complex circuit.
probably has 20 times
the parts in it.

376
00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:38.610
[Mike Matthews] And had this
wonderful distortion.
wonderful sustain.

377
00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:42.881
it almost was distortion free.
sweet. so it did sound like.
Jimi Hendrix.

378
00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:46.017
[JosIf it weren't
for Mike Matthews. there
would be fewer great pedals.

379
00:24:46.017 --> 00:24:49.688
You know. I had no idea.
how far back this company went

380
00:24:49.688 --> 00:24:52.691
until I saw the vintage stash
in the basement.

381
00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:56.795
or met employees that have
worked there like 30 years plus.

382
00:24:56.795 --> 00:25:00.131
[Josh] I think you have to look
at everything he pulled off.

383
00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:02.767
I mean. bankruptcy twice?

384
00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:06.972
Starts selling tubes.
and then decides I'm gonna
make my pedals here in Russia.

385
00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:08.907
Like. who does that?
It's crazy.

386
00:25:08.907 --> 00:25:12.978
Comes back from the dust.
you know. again.

387
00:25:12.978 --> 00:25:16.815
It's an ultimate story
of just a guy that is successful

388
00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:20.685
because he's a great businessman
and he's a great creator.

389
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.927
[Ben Fong] The '60s were a time
of... of amazing change.

390
00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:31.263
and it wasn't just changes
in recording studios.

391
00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:35.200
It was changes in the attitudes
and the power of the artist.

392
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.070
Now. in the mid to late '60s
with artists like Jimi Hendrix

393
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.940
and then especially The Beatles.
some of the San Francisco bands.

394
00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:48.813
they pretty much took control.
and they came to the music with
an entirely different mindset.

395
00:25:48.813 --> 00:25:54.586
And I think that that helped set
the tone for what. uh.
the wah-wah entered into.

396
00:25:54.586 --> 00:25:57.756
[mellow music playing]

397
00:25:57.756 --> 00:26:03.728
I went to work for a company
called Thomas Organ Company.
when I was 18 years old.

398
00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:09.234
One day. uh.
I was sort of between jobs.
and I was talking to my boss.

399
00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:14.573
and he said he was wrestling
with a problem on one
of the VOX amplifiers

400
00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:18.143
in that it had a switch on it
called mid-range boost.

401
00:26:18.143 --> 00:26:21.179
and the switch
was very expensive. about $4.

402
00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:24.182
And he was wondering.
if I could devise a circuit

403
00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:28.153
that would allow the mid-range
boosts to be tuned
with the potentiometer

404
00:26:28.153 --> 00:26:30.789
which only cost about 30 cents.

405
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:36.161
So. you click. click. click.
and you can get mid-range.
more mid-range. more mid-range.

406
00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:40.832
In order to give an expression
to the voice of the guitar.

407
00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:45.003
I asked the engineering
department to take
that MRB switch

408
00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:47.272
that they had put
in that amplifier.

409
00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:51.843
put in this pedal here.
so. that I can play the guitar.

410
00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:55.880
and play... and pick
at the same time.

411
00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.118
Uh. so I went next door and
asked a friend of mine.
John Glennon.

412
00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:05.624
if he would come into the office
and plug his guitar into the
pile of wires. and resistors.

413
00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:07.659
and capacitors
I had on the bench.

414
00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:11.262
I turned the potentiometer.
while he strummed some chords.

415
00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:15.934
Then we looked at each other.
he said. wow.
that's a really great sound.

416
00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:20.972
Then I looked over his shoulder
and through a doorway into
another room.

417
00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:24.142
and. um.
there was a VOX Jaguar organ.

418
00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:26.811
So. I said. hey. John.

419
00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:29.881
go steal that volume pedal
from Frank's organ
and let's put the pod in there.

420
00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:34.753
The president of the company
sent down word that he wanted
to hear this thing.

421
00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:37.055
And he said. "That sounds like.

422
00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:40.659
a Clyde McCoy wah-wah
trumpet thing."

423
00:27:40.659 --> 00:27:44.195
And I thought to myself.
what's a Clyde McCoy wah-wah
trumpet thing?

424
00:27:44.195 --> 00:27:47.432
[upbeat music playing]

425
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:56.374
[Del] Joe Benaron. who was CEO
of Warwick called Clyde McCoy.

426
00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:59.744
And he said. you... can...
can we give you some money
and we'll use your name.

427
00:27:59.744 --> 00:28:02.113
And Clyde McCoy was
living in Louisiana somewhere.

428
00:28:02.113 --> 00:28:06.051
And he said. "Hey.
fine with me." That was it.

429
00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:09.054
That was the beginning
of Clyde McCoy
and the end of Clyde McCoy.

430
00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:11.389
Ended in the fact.

431
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:14.993
that Clyde McCoy's name went
on the bottom plate of the
Wah-Wah Pedal

432
00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:16.895
that was commercially released.

433
00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:18.730
And I said. no. no.
no. Joe. you don't get it.

434
00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.366
I said.
this is really a guitar thing.

435
00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:26.171
So. would you let me make
a record of original tunes.
like I'm doing on record dates.

436
00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:30.241
but I wanna describe
what the growl of a wah
would sound like.

437
00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:32.944
what blues would sound like.

438
00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:37.148
[man The fabulous new Crybaby
Pedal opens the door to
a variety of great new sounds.

439
00:28:37.148 --> 00:28:39.451
Now. let's listen
to the Crybaby Pedal in action.

440
00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:43.888
[distorted music playing]

441
00:28:47.959 --> 00:28:50.895
And. as. I was writing the music
for it. composing it.

442
00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:54.733
I was thinking somebody's
got to really make
this sound really great.

443
00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:59.938
I told Frank Zappa about it
and I said. Frank. you got to...
you got to buy one of these.

444
00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:03.041
And so he did buy one
at Manny's in New York.

445
00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:05.310
And I think. um.
that's where. uh.

446
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:09.380
about the middle of 1967
is when Jimi Hendrix walked in

447
00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.950
and saw Frank Zappa and he said.
"What is that you're playing?"

448
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.352
And he said.
"I bought this at Manny's.
you know. Del told me about it."

449
00:29:14.352 --> 00:29:15.887
So. Jimi went over
and bought it.

450
00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:18.790
[rock music playing]

451
00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:23.862
[Skip] The wah-wah was a quiet.
kept secret at the time.

452
00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:26.097
A lot of people didn't know.
what was making that sound.

453
00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:31.102
They just heard the sound.
It was like. damn.
he's playing his ass off.

454
00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:33.138
But see. if you can play
at your feet.

455
00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:35.206
you can play
some of the wah-wah.

456
00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:37.275
[man 5]
And I think. the wah-wah
was the first effect

457
00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:41.412
that really spoke to the rock
listener or pop music listener

458
00:29:41.412 --> 00:29:43.248
because it virtually spoke.

459
00:29:43.248 --> 00:29:46.417
[rock music playing]

460
00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.157
[Eddie] The way Jimmy Page
used it Dazed and Confused.

461
00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:55.794
I remember sitting in the truck
and watching it on the monitor.

462
00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:59.364
and just being blown away.
A. by the performance that's
coming at me on the speakers.

463
00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:01.833
and B. what is he doing with it?

464
00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:05.036
In the areas of. uh.
R&B and soul music.

465
00:30:05.036 --> 00:30:09.541
I think Sly Stone
has to be credited
with being open to those sounds.

466
00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:13.945
Soon enough. Norman Whitfield
of Motown began hearing

467
00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:18.316
what Sly was doing out
of the Bay Area and said. "Man.
that is a great sound."

468
00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:21.219
And he began to apply it
to his work at Motown.

469
00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:24.022
[Dennis] Norman Whitfield. was
there with one of the arrangers

470
00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:27.859
and they counted off the song.
and I come up with this wah-wah
thing. and I was doing it.

471
00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:31.062
and I could see some of the guys
in The Funk Brothers.
were looking at me

472
00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:32.831
because they never heard
that before.

473
00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:34.966
I'd never forget the...
the horn players.

474
00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:38.236
they were older guys because
we were young and they said.

475
00:30:38.236 --> 00:30:42.307
"I wish he turned that chicka
chicka whitewash shit down."

476
00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:47.178
["Papa Was A Rollin' Stone"
by The Temptations playing]

477
00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:55.119
Cause it's like.
it was the 3rd of September.
wah. wah. wah. wah.

478
00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:58.189
So. that's what it... You know.
it's a Wah-wah pedal
so that's what it does.

479
00:30:58.189 --> 00:31:03.094
I would like to make it sound
like something else other than
wah-wah

480
00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:06.931
so. it became more of
a percussive tool for me.

481
00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:10.501
You see. like a police car
chase. you know.

482
00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:15.373
The Six Million Dollar Man.
and all the... all the '70s TV
themes had... had wah-wah.

483
00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:18.343
[Ben FonYou know. it's not
just. uh. the old Jimi Hendrix.
and Cream.

484
00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:22.480
and Derek and the Dominos.
but also more contemporary
rockers use it.

485
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:27.051
Rage Against the Machine
or Dave Matthews Band or U2.

486
00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:28.620
And different instruments.

487
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.389
Miles Davis had his side players
do the wah-wah

488
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:33.558
through their... their
keyboards. for example.

489
00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:35.560
and of course. he did it through
his trumpet.

490
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.029
And King Curtis
did it through his sax.

491
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:42.200
And so you find this sound
throughout music.

492
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.068
and throughout
all kinds of music.

493
00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:47.338
I think stomp box has completely
unlocked the door

494
00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:52.110
to a... to an awful lot
of creativity as far as
what people did with guitars.

495
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:57.081
[Craig]    Back in those days.
a lot of the pedal was driven by
popular sounds.

496
00:31:57.081 --> 00:32:02.220
And there was also a period of
time when innovation was valued
highly in the music industry.

497
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.589
Ironically. with fewer choices.

498
00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:08.426
there often tended
to be more experimentation
back in those days.

499
00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:11.129
Things changed.
Music changed.

500
00:32:11.129 --> 00:32:14.399
People's attitudes about guitar
and then the things
they could do with guitar

501
00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.067
certainly changed.

502
00:32:16.067 --> 00:32:18.136
Man. you know.
what a world they created.

503
00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:21.072
[low beat music playing]

504
00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:23.574
[Fran]    In the early '70s.
there was this huge explosion

505
00:32:23.574 --> 00:32:28.713
of pedals because there was
a huge explosion in application
of technologies for solid state.

506
00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:33.718
And then around '70. '71. '72.
all these analog effects started
to come out.

507
00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:39.057
New chips every week for. um.
doing just about everything
in the analog realm.

508
00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:44.162
It's a sordid tale.
but at its core.
it's people trying new things.

509
00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:48.266
and then try new things
with new components
when they came out.

510
00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:50.601
[Joel]
I'm way into the Mu-Tron stuff.

511
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:54.572
It's all just super interesting
to me like how... how that stuff
was coming out and then.

512
00:32:54.572 --> 00:32:57.375
you know. the music of the time
was influenced by it.

513
00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:59.143
and then they influenced
each other.

514
00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:02.480
and how that... I think.
that continues of course.

515
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:09.220
I went to MIT to study
electrical engineering in 1964.

516
00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.689
and I was interested
in synthesizers.

517
00:33:11.689 --> 00:33:17.562
My friend Izzy was making
electronic locks which
used electro-optical codes.

518
00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:22.433
Izzy. who wasn't quite as crazy
about electronic music
as I was

519
00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:25.570
said. "Well. can you make
something that actually
makes regular music?"

520
00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:29.407
At which point we collaborated
and made a synthesizer.

521
00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:35.313
What we ended up doing
was to shop around
until we actually found somebody

522
00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:38.416
who could buy
and finance the synthesizer.

523
00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:41.586
That was Al Dronge who was.
at that time.

524
00:33:41.586 --> 00:33:44.455
the President of
Guild Musical Instruments.

525
00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:49.127
After a few months
of flailing around.
we got a contract with Guild

526
00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:51.796
and proceeded to build
the synthesizer.

527
00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:54.699
and what we call the
Timbre Generator to go with it.

528
00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:58.169
One beautiful spring day.
I came into the office

529
00:33:58.169 --> 00:34:00.505
and phone rings.
it's Aaron on the phone.

530
00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:04.409
Al Dronge has been killed
in an airplane crash.

531
00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:09.614
That was the end of Al Dronge.
And that was also

532
00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:12.817
the beginning of the end
of the synthesizer project.

533
00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:17.555
We started to talk about taking
some parts of the synthesizer

534
00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:22.260
and seeing if we could squeeze
them into a pedal
that was affordable.

535
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.630
The decision was to use
the envelope follower.

536
00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.666
voltage controlled filter.
and a pre-amp

537
00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:30.802
to make a new kind of
musical effect.

538
00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:35.373
That's what we eventually
packaged as the Mu-Tron III.

539
00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:42.180
[distorted music playing]

540
00:34:56.527 --> 00:34:58.362
[Beigel]
I think from the very beginning.

541
00:34:58.362 --> 00:35:02.867
both Aaron and I wanted to put
studio quality sound

542
00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:05.603
into affordable pedals.

543
00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:11.109
That shaped our outlook
to design from the beginning
all the way to the end.

544
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:14.545
The thing that put
us so-called on the map

545
00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:18.282
was Stevie Wonder's recording of
"Higher Ground".

546
00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:22.186
which was an exquisite use of
a Mu-Tron in a song

547
00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:26.390
that I felt was very appropriate
to the times.

548
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:29.827
In the '70s.
the big stuff was filters.

549
00:35:29.827 --> 00:35:33.197
Frank Zappa. Grateful Dead.

550
00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:37.635
For Jerry Garcia of all the
different people that used it

551
00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:39.537
and made good sounds of it.

552
00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:44.675
I think that almost the
signature use of the product.

553
00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:50.548
[quirky music playing]

554
00:35:50.548 --> 00:35:54.185
The photomod combination
was something

555
00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:59.857
that was very great at low noise
and handling high signals.

556
00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:07.365
First was a two-cell photomod
for the Mu-Tron III.
and later a six-cell photomod.

557
00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:09.901
which were used in the Phasor
and Bi-Phase.

558
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:14.939
[heavy distortion playing]

559
00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:19.277
[Vai]
Still. the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase

560
00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:22.780
is a fantastic piece of gear
as a pedal.

561
00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.517
Uh. it just has these generators
sweeps

562
00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:30.588
that can. uh. manipulate
various frequencies

563
00:36:30.588 --> 00:36:32.957
and move the tonality around.

564
00:36:34.425 --> 00:36:38.362
Well. the Bi-Phase and all of
this Mu-Tron stuff I heard about

565
00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:41.432
when I was very young. and I was
reading Frank Zappa interviews

566
00:36:41.432 --> 00:36:44.635
'cause he was one of the first
ones to use this device

567
00:36:44.635 --> 00:36:46.904
in a very musical way.
I believe. you know?

568
00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:50.341
And. uh. so I always.
they always held a mystique.

569
00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:52.310
and when I could afford it
later on.

570
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.978
I just started trying to
collect them.

571
00:36:53.978 --> 00:36:57.715
My dad was one of the people
that was always at the forefront

572
00:36:57.715 --> 00:37:00.585
of trying out different things
and using them in ways

573
00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:03.221
that a lot of people
wouldn't use them.

574
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:07.558
So Frank would take an existing
piece of gear

575
00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:12.663
or an existing piece of anything
and just get into it. pull it.

576
00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:16.334
and tweeze it until it did
something he was hearing.

577
00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:19.437
And there was
Utility Muffin Research Kitchen

578
00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:22.373
which is his studio in his home.

579
00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:25.343
And right underneath the control
room was kind of like a
little. uh...

580
00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:26.711
a little office of sorts.

581
00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:29.947
It was a work room
that. uh. his engineers.

582
00:37:29.947 --> 00:37:32.817
one of them in particular
Midget.
this guy Midget Sloatman.

583
00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:37.421
who was. uh. Frank's wife's
brother was brilliant.

584
00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:40.291
And he would go down there and
he would tweak all this gear.

585
00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:44.695
Frank's gear and guitars.
and put effects in the guitars.

586
00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:48.899
and take existing effects
and just tweak them
to get more and more.

587
00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:52.536
It didn't hold any rules
or boundaries.

588
00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:57.041
I had this one pedal that
I used all through high school.
It was my favorite pedal.

589
00:37:57.041 --> 00:38:02.613
It was an odd pedal because
it had a wah-wah and
the distortion built into it.

590
00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:06.484
And I carried it around. and
I used it everywhere. and
I brought it out to California.

591
00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:09.787
and I had it in my first
Frank Zappa rehearsal.
[chuckles]

592
00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:11.656
And he said.
"What is that thing?"

593
00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:15.426
I remember thinking. Frank. take
anything. don't take that pedal.

594
00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:18.296
And he's playing it
and playing it. and I'm like...

595
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.865
Oh. you know.
you can have that if you like.

596
00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:23.701
and he looks at me.
he goes. "Thank you."

597
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:26.003
[laughs]

598
00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:28.706
So it's buried in the
Zappa vault somewhere.

599
00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:31.375
[Dweezil]
That's... that's the thing
that you just keep searching for

600
00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:34.045
as a guitarist is the thing
that will put you

601
00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:37.748
in the creative state of mind
to play your best

602
00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:41.452
and. you know. ultimately.
be able to capture that.

603
00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:44.722
and deliver it to people
'cause the sound that you make

604
00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:48.092
is the sonic fingerprint
of what you do.

605
00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:52.830
And that's what you deliver
to people so that they remember

606
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.433
what it is that you have
to offer. you know?

607
00:38:55.433 --> 00:39:01.105
So if you have all these pedals
and they create the sonic
fingerprint that you make.

608
00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:05.343
that is a big part of the
process of making music.

609
00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:09.080
If they came out with the Phasor
then you'd hear it on albums.

610
00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.881
people would wanna buy it
and they would...

611
00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:12.550
they just couldn't
make them fast enough.

612
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.051
And these were just.

613
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:16.687
uh. kind of based on maybe
studio effect ideas

614
00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.389
back in the... like the flanger.

615
00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:20.424
They wanted to get the
sound of tape flanging.

616
00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:25.963
[Josh]
Modulation is the effect
of modulating the pitch

617
00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:27.798
or the movement of the signal.

618
00:39:27.798 --> 00:39:31.502
And the earliest forms of that
are things like

619
00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:33.471
simply plugging
into a Leslie cabinet.

620
00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:35.573
You see this on Beatles records.

621
00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:37.775
and there's tons of artists
who did this.

622
00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:40.978
You also get into
the use of tape machines.

623
00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:43.981
The term flange is
a Beatles [inaudible].

624
00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:45.916
I believe the story goes.

625
00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:48.519
John Lennon puts his thumb on
the flange of the tape machine

626
00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:53.758
and... and it smears the note.
drags it next to the pure
tape recording.

627
00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:59.530
So you have these early
instances of mechanical effect.

628
00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:05.102
and the Phasors kind of start
in '68 with the Uni-Vibe.

629
00:40:05.102 --> 00:40:09.907
[distorted music playing]

630
00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:22.553
People who hear Hendrix. they
hear the "Star-Spangled Banner".

631
00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:24.789
They hear "Machine Gun".

632
00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:29.527
The idea has always been.
well. the Uni-Vibe
it's a rotary effect.

633
00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:32.596
You put your foot down.
and you speed the cabinet up
or slow it down.

634
00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:35.032
The inventor of that says
that wasn't the case.

635
00:40:35.032 --> 00:40:39.870
He grew up as a kid listening
to radio frequencies
coming from Russia.

636
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:43.774
They'd bounce off the atmosphere
and they come down. and he said.

637
00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:46.844
he listened to these as a kid
and when they bounced off

638
00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:49.914
the atmosphere.
they would whoosh. whoosh.
they would phase.

639
00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:52.950
which is so bizarre.
but Hendrix gets it.

640
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.720
And it's forever known as like
this rotary speaker effect.

641
00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.057
[Art]
People started seeing the
possibilities of what'd happen.

642
00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:01.926
you know. if you started
screwing around

643
00:41:01.926 --> 00:41:04.962
with different kinds of circuits
that would do things

644
00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:09.166
that hadn't been done before.
but to take it
beyond that point.

645
00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:11.669
it... it... it definitely
took some innovators.

646
00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:17.508
I think MXR was really
on the forefront
of a lot of that innovation.

647
00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:20.010
You've got Keith Barr and
you've got Terry Sherwood.

648
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:25.249
And they started out as guys
that really just wanted to be
repairing stuff.

649
00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:28.719
Keith was the designer.
the engineer designing products.

650
00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.921
and Terry was running
the business.

651
00:41:30.921 --> 00:41:33.123
handling the financial
end of it.
And Michael was a salesman.

652
00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:35.626
[Richard] Keith and I
drove down to New York

653
00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:40.030
to the Audio Engineering
Society Show in 1972.

654
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.799
We walked the show.

655
00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:44.235
and I think that's when Keith
kind of got the bug on.

656
00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:46.871
maybe we can make some
products for the audio industry.

657
00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:50.841
Now besides just repairing
stuff. that's when the pedal
started firming.

658
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:55.913
and one of the guys stopped by
for his repairs
and brought by a pedal.

659
00:41:55.913 --> 00:42:00.718
Keith looked at that and we got
the idea for the first one
pedal. the Phase 90.

660
00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:06.056
[rock music playing]

661
00:42:06.056 --> 00:42:09.793
[Joe]
You can hear MXR Phase 90
or Phase 45 blindfolded.

662
00:42:09.793 --> 00:42:14.965
you know. it...
it really is a very. um.
distinguishable phase sound.

663
00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:17.001
You plug into that thing
and it's one knob.

664
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:19.169
and it's like you
put it at like eight o'clock

665
00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:21.071
and you're. you have Eruption.

666
00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:23.140
You put it at 12 o'clock
and you've got Rush 2112.

667
00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.643
You put it up at. you know.
three o'clock

668
00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:28.879
and you've got Zakk Wylde today.
It looks cool
'cause it's orange.

669
00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:33.651
The term genius
is thrown around. uh.
by a lot of people too easily.

670
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:37.054
Keith Barr is the only person
I've met in my life
that I would say is a genius.

671
00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:40.658
Keith dropped out of high
school when he was 16.

672
00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:43.160
He took all of the advanced
chemistry courses.

673
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.797
all the advanced science.
all the advanced math classes
he could. quit school.

674
00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:48.799
walked out when he was in his
sophomore year.

675
00:42:48.799 --> 00:42:51.235
never got a high school degree.
never went to college for a day.

676
00:42:51.235 --> 00:42:53.003
taught himself electronics.

677
00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:55.573
Designing phase shifter.
designing distortion.

678
00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:59.643
plus products
that are going to be the
industry standard for 40 years.

679
00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:03.247
An absolutely. utterly.
brilliant. fearless guy

680
00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:06.050
who I just had endless
admiration for.

681
00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:12.656
[Richard] Uh. Keith and Terry
were renting the lower half
of the house here.

682
00:43:12.656 --> 00:43:14.925
and. uh. they have use
of the basement

683
00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:18.262
so we set up a little
production facility
in the basement of the house.

684
00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:21.665
and we're making
a dozen at a time or so.

685
00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:23.867
The board. it was raw material
we bought

686
00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:26.103
and we actually etched
the boards here

687
00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:28.973
with a drill press
drilling the holes in the boxes
and everything.

688
00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:32.743
We painted and still screwed
the outside boxes
and everything here also.

689
00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:34.812
If you look at
some of the early pedals.

690
00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:38.215
Electro-Harmonix. they were big.
Everything was big.

691
00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:42.386
Where MXR for me
was the first company

692
00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:47.958
that made a phase tone
that could fit in the palm of
your hand and in your backpack.

693
00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:51.061
You know. you're not carrying
around this behemoth of a pedal.

694
00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:54.198
[Ron]
The box that we use. the Bud box
was one of the things

695
00:43:54.198 --> 00:43:56.367
that made the product
so different.

696
00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:59.003
because up until this time
effects pedals have been

697
00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:02.272
these little bent metal things
that. you know.
just didn't stand up.

698
00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:04.341
and that's what really
set the company apart.

699
00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:07.645
I know one of the things that
Michael used to do when he'd go.

700
00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:09.680
first time he went to Manny's
in New York.

701
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.849
he basically pulled
the sales guys out
from behind the counter.

702
00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:13.717
He said. "Come out here and
I'll show you something."

703
00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:15.953
Took them out on the street. and
took the Phase 90 and whipped it

704
00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:18.822
like 50 feet up in the air. and
watched it land on the sidewalk

705
00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:21.358
or on the street.
and then picked it up.

706
00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:23.227
took it back in the store
and plugged it in. and said.

707
00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:25.362
"How about that?"
You know. it worked?

708
00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:29.133
You know.
MXR started coming out with all
these different colors. right?

709
00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:32.069
And subconsciously.
especially the young people.

710
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:35.172
you started identifying the
sound with the colors. you know.

711
00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:37.941
like. even today. if I hear
a certain chorus sound.

712
00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:42.880
it sounds yellow to me
because the MXR stereo chorus
was yellow. [chuckles]

713
00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.349
And flangers. that sounds.
sounds black to me

714
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:48.986
because that was the color
of the MXR flange.

715
00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:51.355
You know what I mean?
So they were really smart. man.

716
00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:56.460
to kind of connect.
all these primary
instincts of ours. you know?

717
00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.930
The distortion pedals certainly
would be part of someone's sound

718
00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:03.033
so we wanted to come up with
some distortion pedal.

719
00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:05.102
The Distortion + is one
of the first ones.

720
00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:07.838
And Terry. Keith's partner.
had worked at a radio station

721
00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:10.874
and was used to
using compression on vocal mics
and everything.

722
00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:14.211
So we. you know. a compressor.
i.e.. our Dyna Comp

723
00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:16.447
became one of our first staples

724
00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:19.183
and so that's what kinda started
the first three
or four products.

725
00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:23.053
[Ron]
It translated over to all of a
sudden all of the major acts

726
00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:26.724
were using MXR pedals
and talking about them.

727
00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:29.259
[Art]
You wouldn't have a lot of the
sounds that Eddie Van Halen got

728
00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:31.495
had it not been for MXR.
for example.

729
00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:35.299
You know. great talents
like he were able to do
with effects like that

730
00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:36.734
really did change the world.

731
00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:40.204
[rock music playing]

732
00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:42.172
[Ron] We moved
to this factory building

733
00:45:42.172 --> 00:45:45.042
and took over more and more
of the factory as it grew.

734
00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:49.379
By the time I left in '79.
it was doing $8.
$9 million a year.

735
00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:51.815
It was a hugely
successful company

736
00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:55.886
from nothing to this company
where we're writing the rules.

737
00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:58.455
we're writing the rules
for. uh. the music industry.

738
00:45:58.455 --> 00:46:00.991
and we're writing the rules
for business
in a lot of respects.

739
00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:03.427
And. uh. an exciting time.

740
00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:06.130
[Albini] In the '70s and '80s.

741
00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:10.033
you would only know about a
special effect of some kind
through its recorded evidence.

742
00:46:10.033 --> 00:46:12.302
Like. you would hear a sound
and say.

743
00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:14.138
oh. I wonder how they did
that sound.

744
00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.373
And then you'd have to do
reading in magazines

745
00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:18.942
and hope that he was asked
a question

746
00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:21.378
about how he made that sound and
then he would spill the beans.

747
00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:23.947
It was kind of like the Wild
West for a little bit.

748
00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:27.117
You.
if you didn't have something
that did what you wanted.

749
00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:29.820
you... you find somebody that
knew how to tinker with stuff

750
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.089
and they would just build
something crazy.

751
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:35.425
[Dweezil]
You know. like when Peter
Frampton would use the talk box

752
00:46:35.425 --> 00:46:37.294
on Frampton Comes Alive!

753
00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:40.097
that sort of sparked
an awareness of that sound.

754
00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:41.965
It made people realize
that was possible.

755
00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:43.867
and then you started
to hear that more and more.

756
00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:47.004
[Peter]
I had become friends
with. uh. George.

757
00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:50.974
He calls me up. He said.
"I'm doing a solo album.

758
00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:53.343
I'd like you to come and play
some acoustic with me."

759
00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:57.481
So one day George says.
"Well. this pedal is still late

760
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.883
coming in from Nashville.
you know?"

761
00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.485
I said. "Oh. wow. that's great."

762
00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:04.188
Then I realized he was on
Nashville Skyline.

763
00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:08.025
And every other country record
you can think of

764
00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:10.093
is Pete Drake just about.

765
00:47:10.093 --> 00:47:13.897
And he set up his pedal steel
and then we did a few tracks.

766
00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:17.568
And then in a slow moment
between tracks or something.

767
00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:21.004
he started to get this...
this little box out

768
00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:23.941
and put it on the edge
of the pedal steel.

769
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:27.878
and is plugging something in
here and another wire in there.

770
00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:29.847
And then he got this tube out

771
00:47:29.847 --> 00:47:33.984
and put the tube in his mouth
and he said. "Check this out."

772
00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:37.521
And he just goes. I am a guitar.

773
00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.990
["I'm just a guitar" playing]

774
00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:04.181
I just went that sound
I've been hearing up here

775
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:07.918
ever since I heard the station
Radio Luxembourg in Europe

776
00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:09.887
that would broadcast to.
to England.

777
00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:15.592
♪ Radio Luxembourg. 208 ♪

778
00:48:15.592 --> 00:48:19.596
So when Pete Drake does this.
I go. it's full circle.

779
00:48:19.596 --> 00:48:22.199
There it is. There's that sound.

780
00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:25.469
And I said. where...
where do I get one of these?

781
00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.571
And he said.
"Well. I made this one myself."

782
00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:33.043
and Joe Walsh was
lent that talk box that I saw

783
00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:36.613
by Pete Drake to do "Rocky
Mountain Way". It's that one.

784
00:48:36.613 --> 00:48:42.019
And then I guess Bob Heil
saw it. and it's very quiet.

785
00:48:42.019 --> 00:48:44.288
So Joe. obviously said.

786
00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:50.027
"Why don't you make another one?
You know. And I'm sure
that's what happened.

787
00:48:50.027 --> 00:48:53.096
And Bob Heil made him one.
you know.

788
00:48:53.096 --> 00:48:55.299
and then that became
the Heil talk box

789
00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:59.569
that I then got given by
Bob Heil for Christmas one year.

790
00:48:59.569 --> 00:49:02.005
And that's
when I started using it.

791
00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:05.943
["Show Me The Way"
by Peter Frampton playing]

792
00:49:16.987 --> 00:49:21.258
It was if. you know.
somebody lit a firecracker
on everybody's ass.

793
00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:23.126
They all just jumped up out of
their out of their seats

794
00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:24.962
and the girls were
all screaming.

795
00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:29.166
It's just a fantastic moment
that a sound like that

796
00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:31.601
would just excite the audience
so much.

797
00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:34.404
[Art]
The development of stomp box

798
00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:36.306
has kind of mirrored
the development of rock.

799
00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:39.443
Jeff Beck. and Jimmy Page.
and The Beatles

800
00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:42.512
and The Rolling Stones
didn't really have a playbook.

801
00:49:42.512 --> 00:49:46.216
You can't just sit down
and say that
you're gonna invent something.

802
00:49:46.216 --> 00:49:47.651
It's probably not gonna happen.

803
00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:50.387
It has to come in a.
in an organic manner.

804
00:49:51.254 --> 00:49:54.524
[Josh]
An Asian company invents
the Bucket-Brigade chip set.

805
00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:57.361
They see Roland. who's making
all these synthesizers

806
00:49:57.361 --> 00:50:01.098
and guitar pedals. they said.
"Hey. we have a new technology.

807
00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:03.567
We want you to be
the first to use it."

808
00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:07.304
And Roland puts it
in a new guitar amp

809
00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:09.539
and they call it
the Jazz Chorus.

810
00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:12.275
And that guitar amp
has two speakers.

811
00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:15.178
and they made it move
like a rotary cabinet.

812
00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:18.315
So the Bucket-Brigade chip
is put in that amp.

813
00:50:18.315 --> 00:50:20.484
They just pull it out of the
amp and put it in a pedal.

814
00:50:20.484 --> 00:50:24.021
[distorted music playing]

815
00:50:33.096 --> 00:50:36.466
[Josh] You take the chorus.
which is a short delay.

816
00:50:36.466 --> 00:50:38.769
so if you blend the clean signal
and its chorus.

817
00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:42.672
if you take all clean signal
out of a Bucket-Brigade.
it's vibrato.

818
00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:45.208
And then another Bucket-Brigade
comes along. and another.

819
00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:48.045
and you can do longer times.
and you end up with...

820
00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:49.579
[grunts]

821
00:50:49.579 --> 00:50:54.351
And you use a Bucket-Brigade
to replicate tape echo.

822
00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:58.055
Some of the earliest effects
in the studio were just

823
00:50:58.055 --> 00:51:00.557
repurposing conventional
studio stuff.

824
00:51:00.557 --> 00:51:02.759
and that's how the
earliest slap echos were made.

825
00:51:02.759 --> 00:51:06.063
Like the Sun Studio's
famous slap echo effect

826
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:09.332
was just a regeneration
on a monotape machine.

827
00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:11.568
[Andy]
So we owe a lot to the
Bucket-Brigade device

828
00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:13.670
because that meant you didn't
have to worry

829
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.639
about cleaning your tape heads
anymore.

830
00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:17.474
or getting your
Echoplex serviced.

831
00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:19.242
The Bucket-Brigade changes
everything

832
00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:23.246
because it led to
the Memory Man.

833
00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:27.384
[mellow music playing]

834
00:51:34.858 --> 00:51:37.661
Well. what's funny about it
is it's really horrible.

835
00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:40.664
It's like...
[imitating Memory Man sound]

836
00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:42.532
You know. just...
it's degrading.

837
00:51:42.532 --> 00:51:45.335
but it's magical 'cause there's
a little bit of unpredictability

838
00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:47.237
just like
the germanium transistor.

839
00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:52.342
We love the... we love the
unnatural unpredictability.

840
00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:56.346
We like things to be a little
off so the Bucket-Brigade
is a little off.

841
00:51:56.346 --> 00:51:58.615
[David]
You think about someone like
The Edge. you know.

842
00:51:58.615 --> 00:52:03.487
you hear a U2 song and
if you turn off all the effects.

843
00:52:03.487 --> 00:52:06.289
it's like he's. you're just
playing like a couple of notes

844
00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:08.558
and it's probably
not a great riff.

845
00:52:08.558 --> 00:52:10.694
You put all those effects on.

846
00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:12.829
and all of a sudden.
you're filling up an arena.

847
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:15.365
You're filling up a stadium
with a wall of sound.

848
00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:19.202
you know. effects. and
the dynamics. and the intensity.

849
00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:21.838
and sometimes make the song.

850
00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:25.342
In the '70s. you started seeing
like mass-produced pedals.

851
00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:28.612
You started seeing bifurcation
of musical forms.

852
00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:30.847
You had Kraftwerk on one side.
you had disco on another.

853
00:52:30.847 --> 00:52:33.416
and you had classic rock.
things happening.

854
00:52:33.416 --> 00:52:36.286
So there was a lot of...
of movement going on

855
00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:38.855
and music was really exploding
at that point

856
00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:41.525
because the baby boomers
now had disposable income.

857
00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:44.561
So that's when you started
seeing companies

858
00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:46.863
manufacturing pedals
in... in quantities.

859
00:52:46.863 --> 00:52:49.466
We also... we were the first
in the... in the world

860
00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:52.402
with the low cost flanger.
the Electric Mistress.

861
00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:56.373
the first with a low cost echo
unit. the very early Memory Man.

862
00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:57.941
the first with a cheap
digital delay.

863
00:52:57.941 --> 00:53:00.277
which was a two second
digital delay.

864
00:53:00.277 --> 00:53:03.947
We were the first with low cost
samplers. uh. Instant Replay.

865
00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:06.216
[Beigel]
And that was about the time

866
00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:10.420
that I had Mike Matthew's
picture on the center
of a dartboard.

867
00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:13.190
[laughs]
How could he do it?

868
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:16.626
You know. he was making
these boxes

869
00:53:16.626 --> 00:53:20.230
which would often fall
apart as soon as they were made.

870
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:24.568
beating us through the market
with our own designs.
we thought.

871
00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:29.439
and just generally outpacing us.

872
00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:31.808
There were a lot of effects
that were coming out like crazy.

873
00:53:31.808 --> 00:53:34.244
When I was doing sessions in LA.

874
00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:36.413
these guys were coming in
with pedal boards
and he had tons of stuff.

875
00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:39.549
[Andy]
Early on. you saw the old pedal
boards built by Cornish.

876
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:44.788
you know. for Andy Summers. and
David Gilmour. and Jimmy Page.
and it was just very bare bones.

877
00:53:44.788 --> 00:53:47.757
Basically. take the pedal out of
its enclosure. put it in there.

878
00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:51.328
make it reliable.
make it lasts for the tour.

879
00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:55.232
[Adrian]
Pete Cornish had very similar
beginnings to Roger Mayer

880
00:53:55.232 --> 00:54:00.237
in that his electronics career
started
with the British military.

881
00:54:00.237 --> 00:54:05.575
He moved to Sound City in London
fixing the biggest stars'

882
00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:08.878
equipment. modifying it.
improving it.

883
00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:11.648
It was in Covent Garden
in London

884
00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:17.487
where he started to branch out
and make custom pedal boards
for artists.

885
00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:20.724
And essentially. Pete Cornish
became the go-to guy

886
00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:24.661
for ensuring massive
touring artists' gear

887
00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:27.530
no matter whereabouts
in the world the artist was.

888
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:31.735
They got repeatability
and consistency
from Pete Cornish rig.

889
00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:35.939
[Anthony]
With the advent of prog rock on.
you're hearing those long.

890
00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:40.043
sustained. sweets.
melodic sounds

891
00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:43.546
as opposed to the... the rock
sounds we had in the late '60s.

892
00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:46.983
and the pedal definitely moved
with the times.

893
00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:49.853
I was pretty wild by
when I started to come through

894
00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:52.455
the history of pedals
was David Gilmour.

895
00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:54.924
There's so many effects
if you look into them.

896
00:54:54.924 --> 00:54:57.927
It's just like the name
that is attached to them
first is David Gilmour.

897
00:54:57.927 --> 00:55:00.597
[Andrew]
If you listen to Pink Floyd
recordings.

898
00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:04.467
you're not gonna be like
hearing effects all the time
'cause it's subtle.

899
00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:09.005
You have a song.
you wanna enhance what the song
is trying to tell you.

900
00:55:09.005 --> 00:55:13.076
And if the effects
are not doing that. then
you're using it the wrong way.

901
00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:16.946
[Gilbert]
Alex Lifeson. Alex. you know.
they. they would build effects

902
00:55:16.946 --> 00:55:19.849
into the songs like Anthem
where it goes...

903
00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:22.752
[imitating guitar playing]

904
00:55:23.887 --> 00:55:25.889
You know. that was.
that was the hook of...

905
00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:28.425
of Anthem was a
was an analog delay.

906
00:55:28.425 --> 00:55:30.827
[Vai]
Brian May was a master.

907
00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:34.397
and his use of delays
was the first time

908
00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:37.567
I heard somebody do something
really musical with them.

909
00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:40.603
[NelSteve Howe. uh.
and Robert Fripp.

910
00:55:40.603 --> 00:55:42.505
Steve Hackett. too. in Genesis.

911
00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:44.841
These progressive rock guys.
so-called.

912
00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:48.812
they're the ones that I think
that really started developing.

913
00:55:48.812 --> 00:55:51.815
uh. a wider palette of
expression on the guitar.

914
00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:55.719
and were able to introduce
the idea of guitar being. uh.

915
00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:57.854
something that didn't always
have to sound like a guitar.

916
00:55:57.854 --> 00:56:00.390
It makes you look at your music
a little differently.

917
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.025
And next thing you know.

918
00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:04.461
you're writing down the road map
with some more creativity.

919
00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:08.498
[rock music playing]

920
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:17.907
The colors that you can get.
man. really changed the music.

921
00:56:17.907 --> 00:56:19.943
There's certain pieces of music

922
00:56:19.943 --> 00:56:23.646
that would not be the same
without the effect.

923
00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:29.686
Exhibiting at the NAMM shows in.
uh. about 1976 on.

924
00:56:29.686 --> 00:56:34.457
we began to notice Japanese
folks coming around to our booth
and taking pictures.

925
00:56:34.457 --> 00:56:37.627
and of course. other booths
are taking pictures.

926
00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:42.065
And then you have
a brand new thing
which had not quite happened.

927
00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:47.537
You have large group of Japanese
pedal makers and companies

928
00:56:47.537 --> 00:56:49.406
coming... coming out of the
woodworks.

929
00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:53.009
The founder of Roland. uh.
his name is Ikutaro Kakehashi

930
00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:56.813
and Mr. Kakehashi founded
Roland in 1972.

931
00:56:56.813 --> 00:57:00.450
He started a little. a subset
of Roland called MEG.

932
00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:05.622
He had assigned them
some products to make
specifically small. simple.

933
00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:08.491
easy to use products
focused mainly on guitars.

934
00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:11.594
Tom Beckmen was the president
of Roland US.

935
00:57:11.594 --> 00:57:15.732
and he simultaneously
was also interested
in making some kind of products

936
00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:18.168
so he made a product called
The BOSS.

937
00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:21.838
Mr. Kakehashi said.
"Oh. The BOSS. I like that.

938
00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:25.508
Can we use that name?"
Of course. Mr. Beckman said.
"Please use it."

939
00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:28.111
[Marcus]
And that's when they made
the switch over to BOSS.

940
00:57:28.111 --> 00:57:31.915
and it was like a radical change
because the chassis all look a
little bit dissimilar.

941
00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:33.683
They all looked like
different products.

942
00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:35.518
And we went to the BOSS pedal.

943
00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:37.921
the compact pedal
that we know right now.

944
00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:40.457
It was like a radical change.
It was like really cool
industrial design.

945
00:57:40.457 --> 00:57:43.159
[Andy]
The BOSS pedals.
when they came out in the '70s.

946
00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:45.695
that's that. I mean. that's it.

947
00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:49.666
We all use BOSS 9-volt power
supply. you know. like
they standardized everything.

948
00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.835
They made these indestructible
units.

949
00:57:51.835 --> 00:57:54.204
[Marcus] You started hearing
about the BOSS pedals.

950
00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:57.240
and a lot of guitar players were
walking around with this whole
BOSS carrying cases.

951
00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.242
[man 6]
The funny thing about BOSS is.

952
00:57:59.242 --> 00:58:02.579
you look on any pro pedalboard.
there's always a BOSS pedal.

953
00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:05.048
[man 7]
One company. the same enclosure.

954
00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:09.152
it just says what it is. chorus.
distortion. overdraft.
and they're colorful.

955
00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:14.157
And you just look at the ad and
you feel like that does it all.
I'm not looking anywhere else.

956
00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:16.559
[Chris] With this particular
pedal. this design.

957
00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:19.929
you just press down and under
this little screw in the back

958
00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:22.999
and the battery was available
to be put in it in here.

959
00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:26.002
The other thing was. is that
this whole surface was part of
the pedal.

960
00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:28.171
So. well. typically.
when you use the pedal

961
00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:29.973
and you just need to
click on a little button.

962
00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:33.009
it goes click.
and this is silent switching.

963
00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:37.146
It would actually make no sound
within the circuit
so that was neat.

964
00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:42.819
This one people die for. OD-1.
This is... They call
it the magic box.

965
00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:44.988
The 1970s. they introduced
the op-amp

966
00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:50.527
which allows for kind of
almost more sequential operation

967
00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:53.162
in terms of the current flow.
where you have guitar

968
00:58:53.162 --> 00:58:57.767
hits op-amp then gets EQ'ed
and then sent out.

969
00:58:57.767 --> 00:59:00.637
[Andy]
The great thing about the op-amp
was that you can get a sound

970
00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:02.672
that sounded like you're amping
cranked up.

971
00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:05.074
And. you know. at that time.
in the mid to late '70s.

972
00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:07.777
you still had a lot of
non-master volume amplifiers

973
00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:10.580
so you hear the sound man
saying. turn it down.

974
00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:14.651
you then look to another thing.
like a pedal.
to get that overdriven sound.

975
00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:18.187
[Josh]
The ProCo Rat. MXR Distortion +.
the DOD 250.

976
00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:20.223
the Guyatone ZOOM BOX.

977
00:59:20.223 --> 00:59:23.159
and you basically have this host
of brand new distortion pedals

978
00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:27.764
come out within three years
in the late '70s. '78.

979
00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:31.801
this new idea
of overdrive soft clipping

980
00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:35.772
so the OD-1 turns
into the TS-808.

981
00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:38.741
[heavy distortion playing]

982
00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:42.245
BOSS had a patent on the
asymmetric clipping so Ibanez.

983
00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:44.747
um. did symmetric clipping.
which is actually smoother.

984
00:59:44.747 --> 00:59:47.684
which. um.
a lot of people prefer.

985
00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:50.954
And the Tube Screamer was just.
I don't know if it was dumb luck
or what.

986
00:59:50.954 --> 00:59:54.023
but it was very well tuned
and it just works really well

987
00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:59.696
for people using Stratocasters
and Fender amps.
It just warms them up.

988
00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:03.967
Gives you the sustain. gives you
some distortion mixing.
well. easier to play.

989
01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:06.069
And it also cuts through
the bands really well.

990
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:08.605
With a lot of amplifiers.
when you crank them up.

991
01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.840
they start getting tubby
in the bottom. It gets flabby.

992
01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.208
It gets in the way of the bass
player.

993
01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:13.843
and Tube Screamer fixes
all that stuff

994
01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:16.746
so it's kind of
a magic little pedal.

995
01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:21.651
Almost every genre of music.
there's somebody you'll find has
used the Tube Screamer. right?

996
01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:24.387
I mean. early Metallica stuff.
that's a Tube Screamer.

997
01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:28.291
You know. most people say. well.
you have a Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Tube Screamer.

998
01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.326
but people wouldn't think
Metallica.

999
01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:32.829
That is one of those pedals
that was around early enough.

1000
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:35.832
It did something that not
many other pedals did.

1001
01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:40.103
[Matthew]
'Cause people like BOSS.
Pearl. uh. Maxon. Ibanez.

1002
01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:42.071
because the manufacturing costs
were so low.

1003
01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:45.742
they were able to out-compete
Keith Barr and the guys at MXR.

1004
01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:48.111
and out-compete Mike Matthews.

1005
01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:50.780
[mellow music playing]

1006
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:54.017
[Anthony]
The Japanese BOSS pedal
killed the first box.

1007
01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:57.920
These things looked like
dinosaurs. and
everyone turned around and said.

1008
01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.157
heck. I don't want big. stupid.
Fuzz Box anymore.

1009
01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:05.294
We want the new BOSS. you know.
OD-1 DS-1. and they were great.

1010
01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:09.766
I was using it. you know.
myself. Even I thought
Tone Bender was dated.

1011
01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:12.969
[mellow music playing]

1012
01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:19.142
[Josh]
In the '80s. you have massive
technology advancement.

1013
01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:22.278
You see this with computers
and technology in general.

1014
01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:25.348
You see
like the first cell phones.
and weird stuff like that

1015
01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:28.818
so all of that pours into
the guitar world.

1016
01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:33.156
The technology worldwide ends
up being applied to guitar.

1017
01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:38.094
So you have these problems
where people are trying
to do the next step.

1018
01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:40.697
but they can't find
the building block yet.

1019
01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:44.701
[rock music playing]

1020
01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:13.463
[Adrian] The 1980s is known
as a decade of excess.

1021
01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:16.365
Essentially. the music industry
was no different

1022
01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:23.172
to. uh. glam metal. spandex.
massive amplifier stacks.
massive hair.

1023
01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:28.411
even bigger shoulder boards.
um. and huge pointy guitars.

1024
01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:32.415
From an effects
pedal perspective.
things shifted as well.

1025
01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:37.153
Despite the influx of all the
Japanese manufacturers.

1026
01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:43.025
the trend moved towards
to these massive
refrigerator-sized rack units.

1027
01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:45.027
[Scott] In the '60s.
you're getting fuzzes.

1028
01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:48.831
you're getting an accident
turned into a... a thing.

1029
01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:52.168
And then in the '70s. all these
effect types just erupt.

1030
01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:55.238
And then in the '80s things
kind of stalled for a moment.

1031
01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:58.441
[David] Well. I think
in the '80s. everything got
a lot more digital.

1032
01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:03.246
And so in the studio. I think
there were a lot of different
processors and harmonizers

1033
01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:05.815
that people in all genres of
music were using.

1034
01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:08.885
whether it was hair metal. or
pop. or hip hop. or whatever.

1035
01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:12.388
[Phillipe]
In the '80s. they got silly.
They used big racks.

1036
01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:15.124
They go out of control
with a lot of the stuff.

1037
01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:17.527
They start to wander
into total paradox of choice

1038
01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:21.097
where people have
a million sounds.
and none of them sound good.

1039
01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:22.832
You know. you'd go into a
recording studio

1040
01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.567
and play straight guitar.

1041
01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:26.936
And then an engineer would
add chorus after you left.

1042
01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:31.407
At that time. it was basically
one effect per rack.

1043
01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:33.309
When I was touring with like
Dave Roth.

1044
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:37.380
this was really before these
multi effects units.

1045
01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.483
I had the equivalent of three
giant refrigerators

1046
01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.518
filled with gear.
and that was my rig.

1047
01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:45.388
[Lisa]    Many of us got bit
with the Rockman bug.

1048
01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:48.491
I fell in love
with the Scholz stuff.

1049
01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:51.294
Tom Scholz is kind of the
ultimate DIY guy.

1050
01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:54.263
super intelligent guy.
amazing guitar player.

1051
01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:57.066
you know. basically made a lot
of his own equipment.

1052
01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:58.467
[Art]
There was a natural tendency

1053
01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:00.970
to kind of ditch pedals
for a while.

1054
01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:05.408
You wound up filling a rack
with all these sound producing
effects.

1055
01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:09.278
Eventually you wind up
with a signal
that's coming out the other end

1056
01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:12.014
and it's kind of not
what you wanted.

1057
01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:14.050
It's over-processed.
if you will.

1058
01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:16.319
[Andy]
I mean. we're at a point
where we weren't ready

1059
01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:18.087
for a lot of those
digital effects.

1060
01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:20.256
you know. the technology
wasn't there

1061
01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:24.160
so it's a lot of those
sterile sounding delays
and reverbs came from that era.

1062
01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.162
For me. it seemed cumbersome

1063
01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:29.465
as an improviser to have
to scroll through parameters

1064
01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:32.468
to make the simplest change
in volume or tone.

1065
01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:37.640
I like the immediacy
of what's now become
known as the stomp box.

1066
01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.544
[Art]
They started to realize
that the sounds were more alive

1067
01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:44.146
and were more tangible
through pedals on the floor

1068
01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:47.550
than they were through
scads of rack-mounted effects.

1069
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:52.488
[Josh]
At the same time BOSS. I think.
is the most significant story.

1070
01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:55.458
BOSS and Ibanez
kind of owned the '80s.

1071
01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:59.528
BOSS invents. you know. the
first ever compact analog delay.

1072
01:04:59.528 --> 01:05:04.600
the DM-2. the first ever
compact digital delay. the DD-2.

1073
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:09.005
[Andy]
It's a huge milestone with BOSS
and their digital delay.

1074
01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:13.976
This is the first time that
you can have clear repeats that
sounded like that tape echo.

1075
01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:18.614
It has a huge frequency range.
and it's in this tiny box.

1076
01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:20.316
I mean. we have BOSS
to thank for that.

1077
01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:24.053
And they've continued that
same DD series to today.

1078
01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:26.289
[Gilbert]
We had the great honor of
playing on The Tonight Show.

1079
01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:28.190
you know.
back when that meant something.

1080
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:30.192
And we did a Mr. Big Tune called
"Just Take My Heart."

1081
01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:32.995
which has like ultimate clean
sound at the beginning.

1082
01:05:32.995 --> 01:05:35.164
And I remember the guy
from Ibanez going. like.

1083
01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:37.400
how did you get that sound?
Oh. the clean sound
was unbelievable.

1084
01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.336
Like. a couple of BOSS pedals
and my blind control.

1085
01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:43.039
[Josh]
I went to a sound check
with The Cure.

1086
01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:45.541
I walked up to Robert
Smith's guitar rig.

1087
01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:47.343
I'm just looking down.
and it's like.

1088
01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:52.014
the original plastic BOSS
boards. one here. one here

1089
01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:54.350
follow the lead lines
back to the amps.

1090
01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:58.087
And it's like. there are like a
BOSS chorus pedal gaff taped

1091
01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:00.189
to the amp with the knobs
on. always on.

1092
01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:02.558
And it's just like
he needs nothing else.

1093
01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.393
Anything that I'm listening to.

1094
01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:08.664
I immediately kind of
want to uncover that mystery

1095
01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:11.400
of what makes that sound.
sound like that.

1096
01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.503
Prince was another big one who
just always played BOSS pedal

1097
01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:18.174
so I was like. well. maybe
I just need to play BOSS pedals.
maybe that will work.

1098
01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:20.409
[Ron] Went to work for Roland
and inherited the BOSS line

1099
01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:22.979
which became MXR's
biggest competitor.

1100
01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:25.648
And Roland grew from literally
a million dollars a year.

1101
01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:30.619
By the time I left Roland.
it was a $125 million a year
company in the USA.

1102
01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:33.155
The guys at MXR
didn't like that very much

1103
01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:37.393
because they were suffering
at the same time that I went
and did well at Roland.

1104
01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.695
BOSS was the pedal champion
in the '80s

1105
01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:44.200
because. what. in 1983.
Electro-Harmonix was run out
of business by the unions.

1106
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.603
In 1984. MXR collapsed
because of whatever reason.

1107
01:06:47.603 --> 01:06:51.407
So floodgates opened and the
Japanese pedals became dominant

1108
01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:53.743
because they were made
really well

1109
01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:58.414
and the only real American
competition was DOD.
and... and maybe Ross.

1110
01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.549
[man 8]
You have Ibanez and BOSS.

1111
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:03.085
and distribution
is everything then.

1112
01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:07.089
and Ibanez decides
to stop distribution
and go direct to dealers.

1113
01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:09.425
and it left this gaping hole.

1114
01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:12.528
And a company called Arion
steps in.
and they're widely distributed.

1115
01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:18.401
So you have this first glance
of like mass-produced
plastic Japanese pedals.

1116
01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:20.036
which is some
of the coolest pedals.

1117
01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:22.271
[Lisa] When I discovered
the Arion line

1118
01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:25.474
and then some BOSS stuff.
you know. in the '80s.

1119
01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:30.179
you know. it was affordable
to actually be able to add some
effects to your signal path.

1120
01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:32.415
[Josh]
Reverberation developed
in the studios.

1121
01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:34.517
and this is anything
from chamber reverb.

1122
01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:37.486
where you have speakers at
one end and a mic at the other.

1123
01:07:37.486 --> 01:07:41.624
and just picking up the natural
acoustics of that room
to plate reverb.

1124
01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:44.060
Again. a massive piece
of machinery.

1125
01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.562
It did go down in size
with spring reverb.

1126
01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:51.834
but again. you really didn't
have reverb in pedal form
for quite some time.

1127
01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:55.738
1985. two are released.
They're the first ever
reverb pedals.

1128
01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:59.275
but they're actually really
horrible Bucket-Brigade delays.

1129
01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:02.778
I think it's the DOD FX45
and the Arion reverb.

1130
01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:08.117
I mean. the DOD FX45
when they released it.
they were first.

1131
01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:11.320
but it was so bad that DOD
never made another reverb.

1132
01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.490
So they like gave up. they're
like. this is it. we're out.

1133
01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:18.227
[AndSo in the '80s.
obviously you had digital reverb
at your fingertips.

1134
01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.563
or at least over
in your refrigerator rig.

1135
01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:22.231
[Josh]
Something starts happening

1136
01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:24.567
and it's the technology
of effects.

1137
01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:28.204
and these new sounds
created new forms of music.

1138
01:08:28.204 --> 01:08:32.408
All the post-punk stuff.
from the UK particularly.

1139
01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:35.711
you know. that from
The Cure to the Siouxsie and
the Banshees. Killing Joke.

1140
01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:39.448
there was a lot of really cool
guitar stuff happening.
you know?

1141
01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:42.518
[AndThat actually did spawn
all new sounds and music.

1142
01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:46.422
especially. you know.
reverse reverb and things
you couldn't really get before.

1143
01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:51.127
["Loveless"
by My Bloody Valentine playing]

1144
01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.669
[Kevin] And from Bill. this was
like. you got to use my guitars.

1145
01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:02.538
and one of them
was a Jazzmaster.

1146
01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:05.741
And I picked it up
and started to strum it

1147
01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:08.277
and go. wow. this is cool.
you know.

1148
01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:14.283
and I put it through. um.
a reverse reverb and
then thought that sounds good.

1149
01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:15.885
And I thought.
oh. turn the tone down.

1150
01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:18.220
I said. wow. it sounds totally
like some weird tape.

1151
01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.256
sort of copy of a copy.
of a copy. of a copy.

1152
01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.424
And then it was playing fast

1153
01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:25.561
and sort of bending the tremolo
already going this way
going hmm. hmm. hmm.

1154
01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:41.477
[man 9] Kevin Shields
was really the first

1155
01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:44.413
and only person using
a tremolo arm on a guitar

1156
01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:48.184
to make a psychedelic wall of
sound no one had heard before.

1157
01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:50.686
And it's a common misconception

1158
01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:53.622
that he used a lot of effects
on those records
because he actually didn't.

1159
01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:57.359
But the influence
that that sound had
on a generation of new groups

1160
01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:59.728
looking for their own sound
is massive.

1161
01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:03.732
And many of these new groups
turn to effects pedals
to create their sound.

1162
01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.935
[Lance] Taking a lot
of the same instrumentation

1163
01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:08.671
that you find
in traditional rock music.

1164
01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:12.408
but using them
in a non-traditional fashion

1165
01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:16.412
to build those
atmospheric soundscapes.

1166
01:10:16.412 --> 01:10:19.515
I can't make it sound
like I'm in a canyon

1167
01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:22.251
with just plugging
my guitar into an amp.

1168
01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:27.256
[man 10] But you see companies
like BOSS. you see DigiTech.

1169
01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:33.462
you see this digital world
become kind of tangible
in... in the late '80s.

1170
01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:36.332
like the Whammy
is a cool example

1171
01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:40.369
of just like putting your foot
on that and throwing your note.
uh. like that's really weird.

1172
01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:43.239
I mean. obviously
the Whammy pedal
is really well-known

1173
01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:46.675
because of. uh. Tom Morello
and Rage Against the Machine
and all that.

1174
01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:48.911
[Albini]
There are some musicians

1175
01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:51.547
who use the Whammy
as an expressive part
of their playing.

1176
01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:55.517
and they literally can't play
some of their riffs if the
Whammy pedal doesn't work.

1177
01:10:55.517 --> 01:11:00.789
[rock music playing]

1178
01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:10.633
It's gonna... it's gonna
inspire you to do something

1179
01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:12.801
that you wouldn't do
if you didn't have it.

1180
01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:18.941
The evolution of technology gave
us new pieces to the puzzle.

1181
01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:22.711
and we were able
to create sounds
that had never been heard.

1182
01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:29.718
[Craig]    I think what maybe
caused the resurgence
of the boutique pedals

1183
01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:33.422
was the dissatisfaction
with a lot of the early
digital effects.

1184
01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:36.925
Digital had not reached
the level of sophistication
that it has now.

1185
01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:41.664
And so you just could not get
that "analog sound."

1186
01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:43.999
[Andrew] I was always unhappy
with the overdrives

1187
01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:47.670
and... and distortions that
were available at that time.

1188
01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:51.006
I just wanted to have
that nice amp sound.
but at a lower volume

1189
01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:53.942
so you don't have to crank it up
and everybody's complaining.

1190
01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:56.979
And then I developed
this product further and further

1191
01:11:56.979 --> 01:12:01.050
until I got to the point that
the first SansAmp was born.

1192
01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:04.586
I must be like
one of the first guys
because. like. in '89.

1193
01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:07.956
I built the first pieces
in my kitchen in Manhattan.

1194
01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:11.393
And I took it down to Sam Ash
and I showed it to them.
It was like $300.

1195
01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:13.929
And they laughed first
because it was so expensive.

1196
01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:15.964
They've never seen a pedal
that expensive.

1197
01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:18.901
But I said like. "Please. please
just take it as a consignment.

1198
01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:20.803
If you can't sell it.
I'll take it back.

1199
01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:22.838
If you sell it. I'll just.
you know. bring more."

1200
01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:25.574
They sold it the next day
to Def Leppard.

1201
01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:28.043
[man 11]
Maybe there was a disgust

1202
01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:32.348
with the big feeling
of some of the companies.
the marketing. the saturation.

1203
01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:37.486
I think it. in a lot of ways.
parallels hair metal and grunge.

1204
01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:42.958
Hair metal. all that stuff.
was just absolutely crushed
by grunge and alternative music.

1205
01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:47.029
And I think that was
a main force in... in people
using pedals again.

1206
01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:50.366
and you saw bands
like Sonic Youth and Nirvana

1207
01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:54.403
just going back to these pedals
that were just secondhand.

1208
01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:57.005
[BlakAnd I feel like the '90s
kind of blew the doors
after that.

1209
01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:58.874
Kurt Cobain stepped on a DS-1.

1210
01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:01.143
Everyone's like.
"Oh. wait. that's pretty cool."

1211
01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:04.513
"What are... what are all those
little boxes he's kicking
around on stage?"

1212
01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:06.515
[man 12]
That's a very simple solution

1213
01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:07.983
to how do you make
the chorus sound bigger

1214
01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:10.519
is you just blow it up
with a Fuzz Tone.

1215
01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:13.789
[Kevin] Sonic Youth actually
really mastered that back
in those days.

1216
01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.891
You know. they were doing bits
where they go to nothing

1217
01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:18.927
and then just go. bang.
you know what I mean?

1218
01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:22.798
There were people who could
craft that more dynamically

1219
01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:26.435
and make it more expressive
like Dinosaur is probably
the... the best example.

1220
01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:28.704
Other people of this generation

1221
01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:30.906
would think of the effects
pedals as kind of
an afterthought.

1222
01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:34.176
And he thought
of those layers of distortion

1223
01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:36.779
as fundamental voices
for his instrument.

1224
01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:39.047
I think it's the end section
of "The Lung".

1225
01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:41.150
I listened to it
over and over again.

1226
01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:44.119
The different sort of dynamics
at the end.

1227
01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:46.555
and the different... there's
a variety of pedal coming in.

1228
01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.157
the fuzz. and the wah-wah.

1229
01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:50.592
and it go round. and round. and
round. you know the bit I mean?

1230
01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:53.729
J Mascis was blowing
my flipping mind.

1231
01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:57.466
[rock music playing]

1232
01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:18.520
[J Mascis]    Um. when I was
learning to play guitar.

1233
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:21.523
I was learning to play effects
at the same time.

1234
01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:25.027
like. you know.
I wanted the effects
as part of playing guitar.

1235
01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:28.197
So I was kinda... it was all I
was kinda all doing it at once.

1236
01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:31.500
and I got this Deluxe Big Muff.

1237
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.236
and I had the Electric Mistress.
and then I got a Wah-Wah.

1238
01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:38.574
I mean. I knew I liked fuzz
in for sure. and the noise.

1239
01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:41.677
and. um. I didn't ever
understood subtle effects

1240
01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:43.712
like. oh. this is transparent.

1241
01:14:43.712 --> 01:14:46.682
Or it was like.
why would you turn it on then?

1242
01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:48.851
You know.
I don't understand what's that.

1243
01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:51.753
That always baffled me.

1244
01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:55.224
Back in the '90s. there wasn't
this big craze for vintage gear.

1245
01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:59.194
It was just. you know.
you had Thurston Moore
grabbing an old Big Muff.

1246
01:14:59.194 --> 01:15:02.564
And Billy Corgan using this
Big Muff from a decade before.

1247
01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:04.566
It wasn't about the mystique
of the gear.

1248
01:15:04.566 --> 01:15:06.969
It was just using the tools
that were available at the time.

1249
01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:08.937
[Billy] There was a band that
we were friends with. Catherine.

1250
01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:11.773
They were all using Big Muff.
all three guitar players
had Big Muff.

1251
01:15:11.773 --> 01:15:15.544
and there was the sound
in the room and it was like.
what is that sound?

1252
01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:16.945
"Oh. it's this pedal."

1253
01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:22.150
There was nothing
like I read it in a magazine
and I went and got the pedal.

1254
01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:25.787
I mean. we literally went
somewhere. found the pedal
for 75 bucks.

1255
01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:27.089
So. yeah. we went out
and got them.

1256
01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:28.991
We started rehearsing with them

1257
01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:31.026
and then that became sort of the
"Siamese Dream" sort of sound.

1258
01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:33.262
And then even
when we did the album.

1259
01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:35.864
and I told Butch Vig that
this is the sound that I wanted.

1260
01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.299
He was like. there's no way.

1261
01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:39.801
And then don't forget.
I was stacking.

1262
01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:44.573
like. in some cases.
as many as six rhythm tracks
so it was a lot to handle.

1263
01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:48.043
It killed all the cymbals.
but that's the sound
of that record.

1264
01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:51.547
[rock music playing]

1265
01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:07.329
It was kind of like what we
liked about My Bloody Valentine.

1266
01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:09.665
the sort of the shoegazer thing.

1267
01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:12.901
but it was like
as if Black Sabbath was melded
with a shoegazer band.

1268
01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:15.938
and suddenly. we're getting
this kind of warping feeling.

1269
01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:19.174
There's a now defunct
music store that used to be
in San Francisco.

1270
01:16:19.174 --> 01:16:22.044
and I remember going in there
one time looking for Big Muffs.

1271
01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:24.813
I asked the guy how much it was
and he named some crazy price.

1272
01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:28.717
And I kind of did one of these.
and he said.
"Well. it's your fault."

1273
01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:31.653
[Andy] Another great example
is Graham Coxon from Blur.

1274
01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:33.689
You know. he... that
he grabbed that Shin-ei fuzz

1275
01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:36.692
and. you know. use that
for the solo for Coffee & TV

1276
01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:40.262
just because it was probably
something that was.
uh. cool looking

1277
01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:43.231
and it sounded. you know.
unruly and it did the job.

1278
01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:46.702
It wasn't that. uh. he read
about. you know.
other artists that used it.

1279
01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:48.770
and he used what was available
at the time.

1280
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.239
[rock music playing]

1281
01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:01.350
[Graham] I never really
studied up on anything.

1282
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:03.919
There was no YouTube.
There was...
there was no person saying.

1283
01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:08.056
well. how does
this distortion pedal clean up
if you back up the volume?

1284
01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:09.958
There was none of that.
I didn't know any of that stuff.

1285
01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:13.996
["13" by Blur playing]

1286
01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:25.073
That. you know. it was just.
you know. and then pressing

1287
01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:28.777
and then go and I'll put it
there and then pressing some.
you know.

1288
01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:30.679
and that's how it went
all the way through.

1289
01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:33.181
And it was just sort of... it
was just to earmark that section

1290
01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:36.918
as a... as a solo section
or an instrumental section.

1291
01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:39.221
And I said. that would be fine.
Let's go on to the next thing.

1292
01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:41.757
And that was one
where it was like a hat trick.

1293
01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:43.425
There was tons of good goals
in that.

1294
01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:47.996
And then sometimes. at other
times. it's utter rubbish. so...

1295
01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:52.300
You couldn't find
a good analog pedal
really in... in the '90s

1296
01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:55.270
other than. you know. Ibanez was
still making some good stuff.

1297
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.205
I don't really know
what changed.

1298
01:17:57.205 --> 01:18:00.676
but people started wanting to go
for more organic tones again.

1299
01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:05.347
I think after. you know.
almost a decade of everybody
has the BOSS pedals.

1300
01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:09.217
that's all they have. you really
wanted something different.

1301
01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:12.254
And when you saw
the Full-Drive ad. you bought it

1302
01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:14.856
'cause like your friends
didn't have it.

1303
01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:20.162
That is the beginning
of this whole thing maybe.
the guitar pedal craze.

1304
01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:23.699
[rock music playing]

1305
01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:39.214
[Blake]
Mike Fuller runs Fulltone

1306
01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:43.151
which is. I mean. I think
everyone has OCD at this point
or has had an OCD.

1307
01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:45.454
This guy starts the company
in '91.

1308
01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:51.126
And in '96 he found his ticket.
This is a Full-Drive 2.

1309
01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:54.162
This is. uh. serial number 171.

1310
01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:58.233
February of 1996. label maker.

1311
01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:03.739
Uh. story goVintage Guitar
magazine talks about this.
kind of blew his business up.

1312
01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:07.209
I think he's sold 80 billion
of these.

1313
01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:09.845
They're currently
in outer space.

1314
01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:11.747
[man 13]
At the time of pre-internet.

1315
01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.849
vintage effects were really hard
to come by.

1316
01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:16.151
and we saw the music scene
coming around

1317
01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:19.254
where musicians
were again interested
in those vintage tones.

1318
01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:22.324
So Mike really used
this as inspiration.

1319
01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:25.360
and was really into bringing
back some of those
collectible items.

1320
01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.996
but also add an element

1321
01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:30.465
that wasn't really there
on the first time around.
and that's reliability.

1322
01:19:30.465 --> 01:19:34.770
[rock music playing]

1323
01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:43.879
[Jeorge] I moved to LA in '91

1324
01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:47.349
and for whatever reason
was not really wanting to go
to school.

1325
01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:49.050
[laughs]

1326
01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:50.418
hanging out on all
the guitar stores in Hollywood.

1327
01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:53.355
and just started messing
with pedals

1328
01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:57.292
and broke out a book
of the Electronic Projects
for Musicians.

1329
01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.294
The reason
I started building pedals

1330
01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:02.898
is because I had a Foxx Tone
Machine that was a tin can.

1331
01:20:02.898 --> 01:20:05.233
and I was afraid
it was just gonna crumble.

1332
01:20:05.233 --> 01:20:07.035
That's what made me
start doing it

1333
01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:09.971
because stuff would break.
and I hated that.

1334
01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:13.008
This would be
the first Piercing Moose.

1335
01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:15.977
This was pretty early on.
It would be '92 as well.

1336
01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:19.047
This is the first pedal I did
a. uh. a H circuit board.

1337
01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:21.817
I did in a bathtub
at home in Hollywood.

1338
01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.186
It's my clone
of my Foxx Tone Machine.

1339
01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:27.122
[rock music playing]

1340
01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:40.035
[man 14] And I was hanging out
at Amp Crazy and. uh. Voltage.

1341
01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:42.838
and Mike Fuller worked over
at Voltage at the time.

1342
01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.406
And I was bringing pedals in.

1343
01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:46.942
and trying to work
on this stuff and learn.

1344
01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:49.911
And it was just.
there was no like.
oh. I wanna be a pedal maker.

1345
01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:52.848
Like. what I would really
consider boutique
that was sort of happening

1346
01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:56.418
to me. it really starts
with Jack Brossart
of Prescription Electronics.

1347
01:20:56.418 --> 01:21:00.889
And. somewhere. I may still have
the cassette tape demo
of the Experience pedal.

1348
01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:04.860
[rock music playing]

1349
01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:19.941
And it actually sort of sounds
like the amps are blowing up.

1350
01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:24.212
and it has an octave in there
so it's a fuzz and octave.

1351
01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:26.882
[rock music playing]

1352
01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:33.154
[man 15] It was like
an instant Hendrix album.

1353
01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:35.156
They had the whole line.
those vintage effects.

1354
01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:37.392
They brought them back.
They had a Tone Bender.

1355
01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:40.228
They had
a Colorsound Overdriver.
you know. an octave pedal.

1356
01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:45.600
And I think. you know. sadly.
he kind of stopped right before
that major wave came.

1357
01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.236
There started to be people

1358
01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:51.973
who kind of like... I feel like
pushed that stuff like way into
the future with like Lovetone.

1359
01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:54.409
where it just seemed
like I can't afford that.

1360
01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:58.613
but that looks
like the most insane thing
that I've ever heard or seen.

1361
01:21:58.613 --> 01:22:01.149
[J Mascis]
I got all of their stuff.

1362
01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:06.488
That's probably the first real
boutique brand that I remember.

1363
01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:10.558
[Albini]
Lovetone is a British company.
They're idiosyncratic.

1364
01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:15.030
like. he ignored the convention
of using the BOSS connector
for power.

1365
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:19.067
and he uses an eighth plug
connector for power.

1366
01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:23.038
It would have made his life
and his users' lives
a lot easier if he didn't.

1367
01:22:23.038 --> 01:22:26.207
but he stuck to it for some
reasons that I don't understand.

1368
01:22:26.207 --> 01:22:29.444
[rock music playing]

1369
01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:36.418
His pedals are
exceedingly comprehensive.

1370
01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:40.188
He sold them individually
to people who wanted them.

1371
01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:42.557
He did not try to market them
as products.

1372
01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:45.160
Like if you wanted to buy
his pedals.

1373
01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.529
he would come and meet you.
and talk to you.
and show you the pedals.

1374
01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:49.698
And if you like them.
you could buy them from him.

1375
01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:53.368
You couldn't just go to a shop
and have them order them.
you know?

1376
01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:57.339
What it did for
the pedal industry.
it gave people permission.

1377
01:22:57.339 --> 01:23:00.308
It gave Zachary Vex permission
to do crazy stuff.

1378
01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:04.512
This is electricity with
Mr. Youngreen. A+;

1379
01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:07.983
Electronics One
with Mr. Youngreen. A+.

1380
01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:10.752
I was a technician
and doing semiconductor
manufacturing.

1381
01:23:10.752 --> 01:23:14.689
And when I got laid off
from that job in 1984.

1382
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:17.425
I had started
a recording studio.

1383
01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:21.363
and I continued working
as an independent recording
engineer and producer until 1995

1384
01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:24.099
when I started Z.Vex Effects
at my kitchen table.

1385
01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:26.234
And I built my first pedal.
the Octane.

1386
01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:29.671
and I brought it into. uh.
Willie's American Guitars.

1387
01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:31.139
I said. "How much
should I charge you?"

1388
01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:32.774
And he goes.
"Whatever you want."

1389
01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:34.776
So I asked him what his most
expensive pedals were.

1390
01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:36.745
and he showed me
the Fulltone Full-Drive.

1391
01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:39.080
And I said. well. I wanna make
it more expensive than that.

1392
01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.783
So I wanted to be the most
expensive pedals in the shop.

1393
01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:45.120
November came in 1995 and
I had sold 16 of those Octanes.

1394
01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.455
and I brought in
a couple of them to. uh. Nate

1395
01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:49.124
and I said. "Hey.
you need any more of those?"

1396
01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:51.126
And he goes. "No. we've sold
as many of those we can sell."

1397
01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:53.194
Make me a new pedal
and he walked away.

1398
01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:54.562
So I designed this.
I stayed up all night.

1399
01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:56.197
This is the original
Fuzz Factory.

1400
01:23:57.799 --> 01:24:01.336
[rock music playing]

1401
01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:09.044
Fuzz Factory.

1402
01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:33.268
I got turned on
to some pedals by Henry Kaiser.

1403
01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:35.737
and I remember plugging it
in and saying to him.

1404
01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:40.475
"Henry. I cannot use this
on your session.
This... this thing is insane."

1405
01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:43.611
In the back of my mind.
I was thinking. but I like it.
you know?

1406
01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:45.647
I just I don't know
what I'm gonna do with it.

1407
01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:47.816
[Joel]    It's a crazy pedal.

1408
01:24:47.816 --> 01:24:53.254
Nobody. I don't think that
was part of a larger company.

1409
01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:55.423
would release
something like that.

1410
01:24:55.423 --> 01:25:01.262
It just was such a cool kind
of fun. totally. you know.
odd ball effect.

1411
01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:03.765
And you would get someone
to like hand paint them.

1412
01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:07.435
[BlakI always forget
how early Zachary Vex was to it

1413
01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:12.140
'cause in my mind I discovered
him. you know. through Muse
like a lot of people did.

1414
01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.876
[man 16] Matt Bellamy
started putting Fuzz Factory

1415
01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:17.412
into his guitars
through Mansons UK.

1416
01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:19.481
and people would watch him
twisting the knobs.

1417
01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:22.350
So now my pedal
was up off the floor.

1418
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:25.286
[man 17] There's not a pedal
builder out there that hasn't
looked at the Fuzz Factory

1419
01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:27.722
and men like took a Fuzz Face
and did this.

1420
01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:32.160
or. you know. the boutique era
would not be what it is
without Zachary Vex.

1421
01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.829
What's interesting is back
in the '90s there was.

1422
01:25:34.829 --> 01:25:38.266
I think. only one I could think
of female pedal builder

1423
01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:40.635
and that's
Fran Blanche. Frantone.

1424
01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:43.571
[Fran]    We. uh. spent. uh.
about six months

1425
01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:47.175
and many thousands of dollars
building a prototype.

1426
01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:49.811
I learned everything that
you never are supposed to do

1427
01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:52.647
in a pedal business
in those first eight months

1428
01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:53.882
because we did everything wrong.

1429
01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:55.617
and we... we wasted
so much money.

1430
01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:57.652
The product
was exactly what I wanted.

1431
01:25:57.652 --> 01:26:00.555
but it was just
un-manufacturable.

1432
01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:03.191
Everything was done
through catalog

1433
01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:06.227
so if you wanted parts.
you sent out for catalogs
from price distributors.

1434
01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:10.565
It would take you months
or. you know.
a year to prototype a product

1435
01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:12.300
that today
you might do in weeks.

1436
01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.536
Instead of making
everything custom

1437
01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:18.339
when. you know. off the shelf
with the hand box
and got powder-coated

1438
01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:23.278
and. you know. just everything
kind of made it affordable
as a product.

1439
01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:24.779
and that became Hep Cat.

1440
01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.749
So when I did
the Williamsburg factory.

1441
01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:29.717
I wanted to do everything
under one roof.

1442
01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:32.487
So I was making my own circuit
boards from raw copper clad.

1443
01:26:32.487 --> 01:26:36.324
stock. drilling. filling.
did my own machining.

1444
01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:38.793
did my own coding.
did my own silk screening.

1445
01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:41.729
everything top-down
was done in-house.

1446
01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:45.366
I could come up with an idea.
develop it.

1447
01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:48.303
make a product out of it.
and have it out to market.

1448
01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:50.405
I can practically
in no time at all.

1449
01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:53.308
Now. when we started out
in the '90s.

1450
01:26:53.308 --> 01:26:56.544
I mean. you had
print publications
which you had to advertise in.

1451
01:26:56.544 --> 01:27:00.481
You had to go to the NAMM show
to get the dealers.

1452
01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:02.317
and then you have
brick-and-mortar stores

1453
01:27:02.317 --> 01:27:05.320
that did your selling.
and that was the structure.

1454
01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:11.759
And it's crazy to think
that people bought a pedal
from an ad in like one paper.

1455
01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:14.395
There was nothing.

1456
01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:17.699
And I think through the '90s.
the internet. you know.
you see Mike Fuller

1457
01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:21.269
and you see something happening
in a website start.

1458
01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:23.671
[Zachary] When Fulltone.
you know. got set up
with his website.

1459
01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:26.274
I went on his website
and I looked at every single
store he was selling at.

1460
01:27:26.274 --> 01:27:28.276
and I would call up all
of the stores he was selling to

1461
01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:29.744
and go. hey. you sell Fulltone?

1462
01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:31.479
And they go. yeah.

1463
01:27:31.479 --> 01:27:33.381
And I go. you know.
historically every single store

1464
01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.450
that sells Fulltone does
really well selling my pedals.

1465
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:39.420
and I just used that as my pitch
and it worked.

1466
01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:43.625
When we started Frantone.
it was right at the cusp of
the beginning of the internet.

1467
01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:46.427
We were probably like one of
a handful of people in Lancaster

1468
01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:49.030
that had internet in... in '95.

1469
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:53.668
I set up Frantone.com
so it was like
one of the very first domains.

1470
01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:59.007
[Dave] The barrier to entry
to the pedal world. you know.
was a radio shack.

1471
01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:03.044
And you could buy a box. and few
transistors. and some capacitors

1472
01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:06.948
and... and... and a soldering
iron and start a pedal company.

1473
01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:09.550
even going back a little further

1474
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:11.586
to the. you know.
the Craig Anderton Electronic
Projects for Musicians

1475
01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:14.555
is where a lot of guys like us
got their start.

1476
01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:16.891
[Craig]    I've been writing
for Popular Electronics.

1477
01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:20.495
and they decided they didn't
want any music-related articles
anymore.

1478
01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:22.630
So I looked around
the magazines.
there was    Guitar Player.

1479
01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:25.633
So I said. "Well. I'll pitch
them on a headphone amp."

1480
01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:28.503
And they were scared to death
that somebody would
like take it into a bathtub

1481
01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:30.405
and electrocute themselves
or something like that.

1482
01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:32.473
And I said. "Well. I'll give you
the schematic for it."

1483
01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:34.409
And they said. "Well.
we have our own art department."

1484
01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:36.444
So they did the schematic.
there was an error on it.

1485
01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:38.446
And that was the best thing
that ever happened in my life

1486
01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:40.581
because they got
300 letters from people

1487
01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:42.617
which ranged from
"I've never built
anything before

1488
01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:44.585
and this doesn't work.
what am I doing wrong" to

1489
01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:46.888
"Hi. I'm the audio engineer
in National Semiconductor.

1490
01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:48.990
and are you aware that there's
a problem with the schematic?"

1491
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:51.326
And Guitar Player    was like.

1492
01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:53.027
"Oh. my gosh.
people are actually interested
in this stuff."

1493
01:28:53.027 --> 01:28:54.762
And then they said.
"Well. can you write a book?"

1494
01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:57.098
I think the real importance
of that book

1495
01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:59.834
was that it made people aware
that they could do it
themselves.

1496
01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:01.569
that it wasn't some strange
esoteric thing.

1497
01:29:01.569 --> 01:29:03.905
It was like building
a model airplane. get parts.

1498
01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:06.441
you put them into a board.
and you soldered it
and you had a working effect.

1499
01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:07.975
That was the biggest
contribution.

1500
01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:10.445
It was like. well.
this guy can do it. so can I.

1501
01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:13.815
[BriaI think the guys
that I was learning from.

1502
01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:16.551
they grew up
with that Craig Anderton book.

1503
01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:22.724
And there were some other like
underground indie publishing
type of PDFs that were released.

1504
01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:27.128
[man 18] Back in the '90s
there was Usenet
which was kind of a forum.

1505
01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:30.798
There was all kinds
of alt dot guitar effects.

1506
01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:33.401
[man 19] And there's a guy
on there called R.G. Keen.

1507
01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:38.373
And R.G. was one of the pioneers
of putting trace schematics
on the internet.

1508
01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:40.041
[Brian]
I barely graduated high school.

1509
01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:42.977
I didn't go to college. just
read a lot of books. really.

1510
01:29:42.977 --> 01:29:45.546
so I... I started out
on these DIY forums.

1511
01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:50.118
listened to guys like
R.G. Keen. and Jack Orman.
and Mark Hammer.

1512
01:29:50.118 --> 01:29:53.921
and just a bunch of people
who in the DIY pedal community

1513
01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:57.024
are full of knowledge
and willing to share
that knowledge.

1514
01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:59.794
It was a really wild moment.

1515
01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:03.464
The internet is just expanding
and expanding.

1516
01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:08.403
And guys like me
can get on there and learn
how to etch a circuit board.

1517
01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:10.538
I didn't go to school.

1518
01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:14.976
We got on the internet
and we let R.G. Keen teach us
how to do stuff.

1519
01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:20.114
and that caused
a bazillion pedal companies.

1520
01:30:23.017 --> 01:30:25.753
[Piera] When I started this
business. I didn't think
I'd be here this long.

1521
01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:27.922
I thought. you know.
guitar pedals.

1522
01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:29.991
how long are people
gonna want to use these things?

1523
01:30:29.991 --> 01:30:31.859
Are they gonna want to use them
ten years from now?

1524
01:30:31.859 --> 01:30:34.796
And this was in the mid '90s.
I really didn't know.

1525
01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:37.965
There was like the big names
kind of. sort of.
dominated again

1526
01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:40.067
where you've got like BOSS.
and DigiTech.

1527
01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:42.003
and all of these pedal companies
were coming out

1528
01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:44.972
with sort of like the standard
that everyone would get into.

1529
01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:47.775
Then like jumped onto the scene

1530
01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:51.446
some sort of more weirder
things. maybe like Danelectro.

1531
01:30:51.446 --> 01:30:54.115
[man 20] You see legacy
brands reboot in a big way.

1532
01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:57.618
Mike Matthews gets
Electro-Harmonix back in action.

1533
01:30:57.618 --> 01:31:02.023
Uh. Jim Dunlop reboots MXR.
and also the Crybaby. Wah-Wah.

1534
01:31:02.023 --> 01:31:04.525
and so many different
variations.

1535
01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:07.728
and DOD really gets
younger players
excited about their products.

1536
01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:10.031
both the reissues
and the originals.

1537
01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:13.134
all this stuff really just comes
back to the forefront
once again.

1538
01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:17.238
[DaviSo I saw an ad
for something called
the DOD Thrash Master.

1539
01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:20.141
this bright pink pedal.
And I thought.
what is this thing?

1540
01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:23.110
Can I even remotely sound
like one of my idols?

1541
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:26.080
I remember one of my friends
coming over who was not
a musician at all.

1542
01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.851
and I showed him this pink box
and I was like.
this thing is so cool.

1543
01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:34.555
like one of these metal bands.
like a thrash band
and I... and I turned it on.

1544
01:31:34.555 --> 01:31:37.124
And he said. "That's just doing
all the work for you."

1545
01:31:37.124 --> 01:31:39.126
[Piera]
Factories that make pedals.

1546
01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:41.929
the original pedal design
is usually really good.

1547
01:31:41.929 --> 01:31:44.499
But then when it gets
into production.

1548
01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:46.200
they'll tend to use
cheaper parts.

1549
01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.070
or the beam counters will change
parts over the years.

1550
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:52.907
And the pedals sort of drift
away from the original
designer's ideas.

1551
01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:57.979
2000 and 2001. you have the two
biggest pedal modifiers ever.

1552
01:31:57.979 --> 01:32:00.281
Analog Man.
it's pretty significant

1553
01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:04.886
because he was modding
the big box stuff.

1554
01:32:04.886 --> 01:32:06.754
[man 21] Since we don't have
to make a million of these.

1555
01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:09.223
we can find the good parts.
the original parts.

1556
01:32:09.223 --> 01:32:12.026
put the right chip in.
change resistor's capacitors

1557
01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:14.762
to make them sound like they
originally were meant to be.

1558
01:32:14.762 --> 01:32:17.765
[rock music playing]

1559
01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:31.612
Sustained for years.

1560
01:32:31.612 --> 01:32:33.548
I love fuzz pedals.

1561
01:32:33.548 --> 01:32:38.319
Two of my favorites here
are the Analog Man Sun Face.

1562
01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:41.622
One of them is the. uh. NKT 275.

1563
01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:46.260
which is like. uh. an original.
like. 1967 Fuzz Face.

1564
01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:51.999
The Sun Face BC 108
is a blue Fuzz Face

1565
01:32:51.999 --> 01:32:55.102
like. uh. David Gilmour
had Live at Pompeii.

1566
01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:58.339
[rock music playing]

1567
01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:09.884
Echo and fuzz. man. I mean.
you just can't really go wrong.

1568
01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:12.119
[laughs]

1569
01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:15.256
When this got going.
and you think of guys
like Robert Keeley. Analog Man.

1570
01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:19.360
those guys were boutique before
this was even like a thing.

1571
01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.963
[Robert] Something I took
from car stereo world.

1572
01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:24.732
and home stereo. and...
and working for other people

1573
01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:28.102
is I'd see that. you know.
they'd have switches
for bass response or whatever.

1574
01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:29.971
I didn't really see
that on pedals

1575
01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:33.774
so that's how I brought
the switches and mods to pedals

1576
01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:37.211
to change the sound of them up
to give people more flexibility.

1577
01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:39.080
[Gilbert]
The Keeley Tube Screamer.

1578
01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:41.849
he put. you know. the standard
foot switch in the middle.

1579
01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:44.785
Is it... this style foot switch.
I was never quite sure
like that. I turn it on.

1580
01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:48.055
I'm like. this is a better
design for human beings

1581
01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:50.257
who want to feel something
go ka-chunk.

1582
01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:52.193
And it sounded great too.

1583
01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:54.095
[man 22]
Uh. Keeley is interesting

1584
01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:57.164
because I saw the way
he grew his business model.

1585
01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:59.266
uh. from just modding
boss pedals

1586
01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:02.303
to coming out with his
own compressor obviously.

1587
01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:05.006
[Robert] My first original one
was called the Katana

1588
01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:09.877
and that one was a... a couple
of fat transistors designed
to sound like tubes.

1589
01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:12.647
That pedal ended up being
picked up by John Mayer.

1590
01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:15.416
And that was the first time
I kind of caught the inkling

1591
01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:19.820
that every part selection
in even a simple design

1592
01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:24.325
like that was. uh. something
that. uh. you can create
some magic with.

1593
01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:29.030
Dealers started contacting me
and saying. "Hey. can you build
a couple of those for my shop?"

1594
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:34.769
And on it goes till
Guitar Center calls you one day
and wants to place an order too.

1595
01:34:34.769 --> 01:34:37.405
[mellow music playing]

1596
01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:43.711
[Oliver] But I felt like
at some point I kinda hit a wall

1597
01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:46.380
and like sort of
every single sound
that you could possibly get

1598
01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:52.253
so I wanted to just sort of
see what else that nobody else
had ever come up with before.

1599
01:34:52.253 --> 01:34:55.122
But then I wanted to go on
this trip with this girlfriend
to Europe

1600
01:34:55.122 --> 01:34:57.058
and I didn't have any money.

1601
01:34:57.058 --> 01:34:59.894
This was basically
my big idea to make money.

1602
01:34:59.894 --> 01:35:02.396
to go to Europe and backpack
for a month was

1603
01:35:02.396 --> 01:35:05.800
for an effect that nobody
had ever really come out
with before.

1604
01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:07.735
which is like this force
feedback loop.

1605
01:35:07.735 --> 01:35:10.805
And I thought Death By Audio
sounded cool. you know.

1606
01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:14.742
and so I was like. that sounds
cool. Total Sonic Annihilation.

1607
01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:19.113
[rock music playing]

1608
01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:30.758
I think like a month
before we were set to leave.

1609
01:35:30.758 --> 01:35:33.427
you know. sold like 30 of them
or something.

1610
01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:37.164
And so that was enough
to go on that trip.

1611
01:35:37.164 --> 01:35:40.401
My first experience with
Death By Audio was giant pedals.

1612
01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:44.772
maybe with only one or two knobs
and totally DIY.

1613
01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:49.810
That was pretty bold because
at that point you had really
professional looking. slick.

1614
01:35:49.810 --> 01:35:52.279
you know. companies up
until that point.

1615
01:35:52.279 --> 01:35:55.282
I could recognize
like all these art on those.

1616
01:35:55.282 --> 01:35:57.218
like that's
like '90s punk rock flyers.

1617
01:35:57.218 --> 01:36:00.121
I was like. oh. you can.
I can put these things together

1618
01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:02.156
so that was like
a big influence.

1619
01:36:02.156 --> 01:36:05.760
Anyone will come up with
any crazy idea. or awesome.

1620
01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.095
or stupid. or whatever idea.
send it to me.

1621
01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:11.165
and I would just give them
a quote of how much
I would build it for.

1622
01:36:11.165 --> 01:36:14.535
And then. and I even had no idea
how to build it.

1623
01:36:14.535 --> 01:36:16.804
then we'll just figure it out.

1624
01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:21.842
[man 23] So in 2003-'4.
the forums started appearing

1625
01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:24.145
like Harmony Central
and things like that.

1626
01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:26.814
I saw that lots of people were
building. you know.
effects pedals.

1627
01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:30.918
People like Wampler.
and Jamie at EarthQuaker
and stuff like that.

1628
01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:33.788
and Catalinbread. they all
started up around that time.

1629
01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:36.924
[Shadid] Catalinbread comes out
of Portland in like '03-'04.

1630
01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:39.260
Nic Harris makes
these really cool pedals

1631
01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:43.297
that are like really fresh. but
also nostalgic in certain ways.

1632
01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:45.966
And it's this feeling
like old is new again.

1633
01:36:45.966 --> 01:36:48.068
And then all of a sudden.

1634
01:36:48.068 --> 01:36:51.105
Portland becomes
this kind of epicenter
of like crazy pedal builders

1635
01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:52.940
for more experimental players.

1636
01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:55.176
[Anthony]
Portland is a very proud city.

1637
01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:58.045
and it's all about
craftsmanship here.

1638
01:36:58.045 --> 01:37:01.382
It's... it's a lot broader
than just pedals really.

1639
01:37:01.382 --> 01:37:04.018
People here are very encouraged.

1640
01:37:04.018 --> 01:37:08.422
and there's a lot of community
with the entrepreneurs in town.
um. to help each other out.

1641
01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:10.357
The reason why we make
our pedals

1642
01:37:10.357 --> 01:37:14.562
is to help artists explore
their creative boundaries.

1643
01:37:14.562 --> 01:37:19.200
We really want to make something
that has a really high level
of craftsmanship.

1644
01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.535
but as soon as you plug in.

1645
01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:25.139
it needs to inspire you to go
somewhere you haven't
been before.

1646
01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:28.342
[Josh] Well. there's so many
great examples of crazy.

1647
01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:32.413
I also really love like Jamie
Stillman's approach to crazy.

1648
01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:36.217
It's almost a little bit
like crazy is not crazy anymore.

1649
01:37:36.217 --> 01:37:41.255
[rock music playing]

1650
01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:56.337
[screeching]

1651
01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:01.976
[Patrick] He was The Black Keys
tour manager
for about five years

1652
01:38:01.976 --> 01:38:03.577
and he used to fix Dan's pedals.

1653
01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:06.614
And around 2006.
he started building pedals.

1654
01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:11.485
I have these early EarthQuaker
pedals that he made for me.

1655
01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:18.459
This has got a deal roller.
fuzz. this one.
uh. Fantastic Beast.

1656
01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:20.427
This is a B and M.
I'm not sure what that is.

1657
01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:24.231
but he's like a fuzz expert
so... this is FY SL X.

1658
01:38:24.231 --> 01:38:27.301
I don't know what that is.
Cool shit though.

1659
01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:30.104
He gave you a sound
that you could put on records.

1660
01:38:30.104 --> 01:38:31.972
and it's gonna make
people feel weird.

1661
01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:34.041
Like it just. I heard
that first time I plugged in.

1662
01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:35.976
I was like. whoa.

1663
01:38:35.976 --> 01:38:40.314
[mellow music playing]

1664
01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:54.261
When they came on.
they... they were set to just
light shit on fire.

1665
01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:58.098
When I met him.
it was just Jamie in his
basement making pedals.

1666
01:38:58.098 --> 01:39:01.936
[Albini] EarthQuaker
is a remarkable company
in a number of different ways.

1667
01:39:01.936 --> 01:39:04.305
Like they... they keep
all of their production local.

1668
01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:08.175
They keep employing musicians
from the local scene
which I think is fantastic.

1669
01:39:08.175 --> 01:39:12.947
And each of those people
in some way or another are
either a musician. an artist.

1670
01:39:12.947 --> 01:39:16.383
or there is someone
who has the same sort of empathy

1671
01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:18.953
and sort of
sympathetic resonance

1672
01:39:18.953 --> 01:39:21.555
that's gonna come through
to someone that uses them.

1673
01:39:21.555 --> 01:39:27.261
[Jamie] And they're not afraid
to overwhelm you with options
which I think is great.

1674
01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:29.530
I'm usually working
on a lot of ideas at once.

1675
01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:31.665
and it's like nine times
out of ten

1676
01:39:31.665 --> 01:39:35.235
it's either
I woke up with some idea

1677
01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:37.071
where I'm like. come on.
I wanna know what that's like

1678
01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:39.540
and most of the time it sucks.
[laughs]

1679
01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:42.309
[Julie] Well. it's interesting
'cause it's technical work.

1680
01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:46.747
I mean. it's very involved.
but it really is creativity.

1681
01:39:46.747 --> 01:39:50.284
I can't tell him what to do.
Nobody can tell him what to do.

1682
01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:52.019
-Fuck you.
-[laughing]

1683
01:39:52.019 --> 01:39:54.288
Uh. don't tell me what to do.

1684
01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:58.225
[upbeat music playing]

1685
01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.329
[Brian] They mostly all start
from the same place

1686
01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:05.099
where they just started
tinkering with things
in some way.

1687
01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:07.701
That's like almost universal.
I think.

1688
01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:10.738
There are these forums.
I could ask
these people questions

1689
01:40:10.738 --> 01:40:14.174
and they would help guide you
to the answer.

1690
01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:16.577
Along that way.
I bought a breadboard.

1691
01:40:16.577 --> 01:40:20.280
which is. basically allows you
to make circuits quickly
without soldering.

1692
01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:24.551
And I just kind of
locked myself away
for about two years.

1693
01:40:24.551 --> 01:40:27.121
and just started experimenting
with what happens

1694
01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:30.190
when you run this type of guitar
into this type of gain stage.

1695
01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:33.560
And what happens with EQ
whenever you boost the bass
or increase the mids.

1696
01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.630
which that ended up leading me
to like self-publishing a book

1697
01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:39.199
about modifying pedals
and... and building pedals.

1698
01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:41.502
I wanted something that sounded
like an orange.

1699
01:40:41.502 --> 01:40:43.404
and I wanted something
that sound like a messy boogie.

1700
01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:45.706
And I wanted like all
of these different flavors.

1701
01:40:45.706 --> 01:40:48.175
And it was obviously
not very practical

1702
01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:50.811
to drag four or five amps
to a bar gig.

1703
01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:52.446
If you look through our history.

1704
01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:54.081
a lot of people
kind of considered us

1705
01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:55.682
to be like the amp
in a box company

1706
01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:58.318
that just made a lot
of good dirt pedals.

1707
01:40:58.318 --> 01:41:00.187
I love that stuff.

1708
01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:02.556
but I... I feel like
I wanna push the boundaries of.

1709
01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:04.324
and kind of just do
some other things

1710
01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:06.293
that are fun to me.
'cause I like other stuff too.

1711
01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:08.162
And you can only make
so many marshals.

1712

um. you know.
making the Morning Glory.
the Pulp N Peel.

1716
01:41:19.606 --> 01:41:22.209
Taking these good circuits
and making them great.

1717
01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:24.711
[Andy]
When I saw JHS pedals
come through the door.

1718
01:41:24.711 --> 01:41:27.514
the simplicity of them
was... was a really
interesting thing.

1719
01:41:27.514 --> 01:41:31.185
because it was basically saying
we care about the circuits.

1720
01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:35.222
We don't really care about
trying to blow your head off
with cool graphics and designs.

1721
01:41:35.222 --> 01:41:37.291
We were just making pedals
that sound good.

1722
01:41:37.291 --> 01:41:39.393
When you're holding a pedal.

1723
01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:43.263
that is as important to me
is how it sounds.

1724
01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:48.802
75% of the time.
I think of a name or a look.

1725
01:41:48.802 --> 01:41:54.708
or like the emotion of something
that would make someone play
differently.

1726
01:41:54.708 --> 01:41:59.313
So the icon.
a name pointing to a sound
or a piece of history.

1727
01:41:59.313 --> 01:42:01.615
and then the tricky part
is to make a circuit

1728
01:42:01.615 --> 01:42:03.450
that's exceptional
to fit in that.

1729
01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:05.652
That's equally as important.
let that be said.

1730
01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:08.388
I have to go back
when I'm designing

1731
01:42:08.388 --> 01:42:13.360
and remember the feeling
of hearing Pearl Jam. "Alive".
on my brother's cassette tape

1732
01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:18.465
and how I felt.
and recreating those feelings
for guitarists.

1733
01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:21.168
in my opinion.
is... is as important.

1734
01:42:21.168 --> 01:42:23.637
if not more important.
than the circuit inside.

1735
01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:27.307
[man 24] The new age of guitar
god kind of begins again
with Jack White.

1736
01:42:27.307 --> 01:42:28.675
uh. Black Keys.

1737
01:42:28.675 --> 01:42:30.577
Arctic Monkeys. and Strokes.

1738
01:42:30.577 --> 01:42:33.147
The stuff that Annie Clark
from St. Vincent does

1739
01:42:33.147 --> 01:42:36.383
with... with fuzz
and guitar synths
is mind blowing.

1740
01:42:36.383 --> 01:42:41.455
And she's using
like Death By Audio.
nd Z.Vex . and Electro-Harmonix.

1741
01:42:41.455 --> 01:42:44.825
So it's this cool blend
of like old stuff and new stuff

1742
01:42:44.825 --> 01:42:47.728
to create something powerful
and original.

1743
01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:52.266
Independent music
really hit its stride
in the '90s and 2000s.

1744
01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:58.305
And I think the market
finally had to take notice
of bands and music like that.

1745
01:42:58.305 --> 01:43:00.841
[Steve] Now. it's rare
for every musician

1746
01:43:00.841 --> 01:43:04.811
not to have
like an assortment of pedals
in front of them.

1747
01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:08.849
and it's not uncommon
for songs to be written

1748
01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:12.419
around the features
of a particular effect.

1749
01:43:12.419 --> 01:43:15.956
[Piera]
I was invited to see Radiohead
at Madison Square Garden

1750
01:43:15.956 --> 01:43:18.492
and seeing Thom and Ed

1751
01:43:18.492 --> 01:43:21.361
kneeling down
in front of their pedalboards
playing the pedals.

1752
01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:23.263
not even touching their guitars.

1753
01:43:23.263 --> 01:43:24.765
heh. that's pretty amazing.

1754
01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:27.334
[mellow music playing]

1755
01:43:41.782 --> 01:43:43.617
[Sarah]
Usually when I'm composing.

1756
01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:46.653
I start out
by putting a board together.

1757
01:43:46.653 --> 01:43:49.823
then plugging in.
and then seeing what happens.

1758
01:43:49.823 --> 01:43:52.593
You know.
I think the magic really happens

1759
01:43:52.593 --> 01:43:56.863
when certain effects
are combined. you know?

1760
01:44:15.349 --> 01:44:18.452
Early 2000.
when I started playing
in Mars Volta. Omar had...

1761
01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:22.623
I probably had 40 or 50 pedals.
and he had probably
at that point 300 pedals.

1762
01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:25.926
[distorted music playing]

1763
01:44:35.002 --> 01:44:37.938
There's bands that I grew up
listening to that
are using this pedal.

1764
01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:41.041
and it still... is crazy for me
to wrap my head around.

1765
01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:44.011
you know. Aerosmith
or High on Fire
using something that I made

1766
01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:46.413
and designed in my basement.
right?

1767
01:44:46.413 --> 01:44:50.884
So all these new cool music
is happening.
and you're kind of going.

1768
01:44:50.884 --> 01:44:52.986
what are these sounds
I'm hearing?

1769
01:44:52.986 --> 01:44:55.622
It... there's
this kind of mass realization

1770
01:44:55.622 --> 01:44:57.991
among these communities
of musicians.

1771
01:44:57.991 --> 01:45:01.461
that is.
boutique pedal companies are.
you know. they have arrived.

1772
01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:03.030
They're influencing.
and they're innovating.

1773
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:05.599
and... and they're popping up
all over.

1774
01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:08.969
[Johnny] It kind of
was this huge beginning
of a bubble

1775
01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:12.072
around 2005. or '6. or '7.

1776
01:45:12.072 --> 01:45:14.608
[man 25]
The whole industry of guitar
effects pedals.

1777
01:45:14.608 --> 01:45:17.444
not just boutique.
but mass produced as well.

1778
01:45:17.444 --> 01:45:20.013
was consistently
steadily climbing upward.

1779
01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:23.050
[John]
The vintage guitar market.
the amp market. collectors.

1780
01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:25.052
you have big money items
on the table.

1781
01:45:25.052 --> 01:45:27.688
Guitar players.
you go buy guitars and amps.

1782
01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:30.724
but then all of a sudden.
the economy tanks.

1783
01:45:30.724 --> 01:45:35.562
[soft music playing]

1784
01:45:38.031 --> 01:45:40.667
[Holley] We were really worried.
uh. in 2008

1785
01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:44.471
We're like. "Oh. shit.
what are... we're gonna have
to get real jobs."

1786
01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:45.906
We're virtually unemployable.

1787
01:45:45.906 --> 01:45:49.810
And economic conditions
around '07-'08.

1788
01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:52.446
you saw a lot of people
who stopped
buying expensive items.

1789
01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:54.648
They stopped buying guitars.

1790
01:45:54.648 --> 01:45:58.618
They still wanted something
that would inspire them
to write or... or play.

1791
01:45:58.618 --> 01:46:01.922
Guitar players tend
to turn over their sound
every six months to a year.

1792
01:46:01.922 --> 01:46:03.890
So if they can't change
their guitars

1793
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:05.726
and they can't change
their amps.

1794
01:46:05.726 --> 01:46:08.028
really their resources
are adding

1795
01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:10.097
to their collection
of effects pedals
to get different sounds.

1796
01:46:10.097 --> 01:46:14.101
The recession fueled
the growth of pedal cells.

1797
01:46:14.101 --> 01:46:17.604
I mean. there's no way
out of that discussion.

1798
01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:20.941
[Paul] Pretty soon. anybody
who could do something crafty

1799
01:46:20.941 --> 01:46:25.946
and make a business of their own
in anything.
you know. alcohol. furniture.

1800
01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:27.647
whatever.
all of a sudden. there were...

1801
01:46:27.647 --> 01:46:31.485
there was a super explosion
of handmade goods.

1802
01:46:31.485 --> 01:46:34.621
[Julie]
Well. we didn't really know
we were starting a business.

1803
01:46:34.621 --> 01:46:37.057
-[Jamie] Heh. yeah.
-Like it was pretty well
a business

1804
01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:39.993
before we're like. "Oh. my God.
we have a business."

1805
01:46:39.993 --> 01:46:42.562
-[laughs]
-Right.

1806
01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:45.599
[Colt] The... the music
instruments industry
is a... is very unique industry

1807
01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:51.805
where it's mostly
hobbyists turned
into accidental businessmen.

1808
01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:54.107
[Holley]
And it really snowballed.

1809
01:46:54.107 --> 01:46:58.845
There is absolutely no way
we could have done
what we did today.

1810
01:46:58.845 --> 01:47:01.114
I mean. look at us. There's...
there's no business sense here.

1811
01:47:01.114 --> 01:47:02.949
There's no talent.
There's no anything.

1812
01:47:02.949 --> 01:47:06.620
We got... It was dumb luck
and lack of competitions.

1813
01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:07.821
and brute force.

1814
01:47:07.821 --> 01:47:10.090
[both laugh]

1815
01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:12.759
[Pete]    You know.
more and more pedal makers
are finding that.

1816
01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:15.929
if they have a small operation
and are. you know.
doing something interesting

1817
01:47:15.929 --> 01:47:18.665
that they can probably sustain
a small business

1818
01:47:18.665 --> 01:47:22.769
without having to become
a. you know. a big entity.

1819
01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:26.006
[Brian] As we got popular.
other companies like us
who were doing the same thing.

1820
01:47:26.006 --> 01:47:29.075
but building in our garage
as musicians.

1821
01:47:29.075 --> 01:47:31.011
you know. our businesses
just kind of happened

1822
01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:33.613
without really meaning
for it too.

1823
01:47:33.613 --> 01:47:36.917
But as you get bigger.
you can't continue building
in that garage.

1824
01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:40.754
All of a sudden.
our. you know. back orders
would get so high

1825
01:47:40.754 --> 01:47:42.589
that we decided
to hire more people.

1826
01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:44.724
There was one point.
it was so crazy

1827
01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:48.094
that I was. like.
hired eight people
on the same day.

1828
01:47:48.094 --> 01:47:49.996
And most of them are still here.

1829
01:47:49.996 --> 01:47:53.533
[Josh]
I remember 18-hour days
out in the shed.

1830
01:47:53.533 --> 01:47:55.969
you know. building stuff.
shipping stuff.

1831
01:47:55.969 --> 01:48:00.106
answering e-mails.
making a horrible website
on my own.

1832
01:48:00.106 --> 01:48:02.142
it became way too much.

1833
01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:03.844
[Ryan]    Eventually
it comes to a point

1834
01:48:03.844 --> 01:48:06.046
where we're running Fuzzrocious
full-time.

1835
01:48:06.046 --> 01:48:08.482
and we're both in education
full-time.

1836
01:48:08.482 --> 01:48:13.119
Every night is spent
in front of the TV or in here
just populate parts

1837
01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:15.956
or spend your time
on your lunch breaks doing that
as well.

1838
01:48:15.956 --> 01:48:18.158
You just never stop working.

1839
01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:20.060
[Jack] I was teching out
of a music shop.

1840
01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:22.095
um. just fixing amps
or whatever.

1841
01:48:22.095 --> 01:48:24.231
A customer came in
and. ah. he saw a breadboard
on my bench.

1842
01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:27.167
He's like. "Hey. what's that?"
And I go. "Oh. it's this
echo thing that I'm working on.

1843
01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:30.136
So he plays it.
and he's like. "This is great.
How much is it?"

1844
01:48:30.136 --> 01:48:32.572
I'm like.
"I think it'll sell for $200."

1845
01:48:32.572 --> 01:48:34.674
He's like. "Well. how much
if I buy 10 of them?"

1846
01:48:34.674 --> 01:48:36.142
"How about a hundred bucks?"

1847
01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:38.578
That's a thousand dollars.
He's like. "Okay."

1848
01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:41.214
Just like knowing
how volumes work. drugs.
and all that kind of thing.

1849
01:48:41.214 --> 01:48:43.149
like you get a discount
if you buy a bunch. you know?

1850
01:48:43.984 --> 01:48:45.986
[Pavla] The whole process
is incredibly challenging

1851
01:48:45.986 --> 01:48:48.188
from dealing
with customs officials.

1852
01:48:48.188 --> 01:48:50.090
you know. at the very end
of the supply chain

1853
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:53.093
to the customer
to engineering problems
in the beginning.

1854
01:48:53.093 --> 01:48:55.195
And so just dealing
with sizing issues.

1855
01:48:55.195 --> 01:48:58.164
how to squeeze something
into a small enclosure
and make it functional.

1856
01:48:58.164 --> 01:48:59.566
And we didn't go
to school for this.

1857
01:48:59.566 --> 01:49:00.867
Nobody taught us how to do this.

1858
01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:02.903
You just kinda dive
in head first

1859
01:49:02.903 --> 01:49:06.139
and figure it out
as you go along.

1860
01:49:06.139 --> 01:49:08.241
[Heather]
Now. as it's been growing
so much more.

1861
01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:10.810
it's kind of like.
well. now. we need other roles.

1862
01:49:10.810 --> 01:49:13.246
We need someone
who does graphic design.

1863
01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:15.782
or we need. you know.
social media person.

1864
01:49:15.782 --> 01:49:20.587
So I think it's just trying
to accomplish everything.
you know.

1865
01:49:20.587 --> 01:49:23.723
that you possibly can
with such a small team.

1866
01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:27.794
[IljNow. they are big names
such as JHS. EQD.

1867
01:49:27.794 --> 01:49:30.864
All of them proved
to the new generation

1868
01:49:30.864 --> 01:49:32.966
that you can start
from your garage.

1869
01:49:32.966 --> 01:49:35.902
and become kind of
a household name

1870
01:49:35.902 --> 01:49:37.904
in... in the guitarist
community.

1871
01:49:37.904 --> 01:49:40.040
The world is very small
at that point

1872
01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.777
where we got in
was a perfect storm

1873
01:49:43.777 --> 01:49:46.212
to really get into.
to making pedals.

1874
01:49:46.212 --> 01:49:49.649
[mellow music playing]

1875
01:49:51.217 --> 01:49:54.054
[Phillipe]
I know a lot of people.
myself included.

1876
01:49:54.054 --> 01:49:57.624
who we really slave
over our designs.

1877
01:49:57.624 --> 01:49:59.593
where it's like a breadboard
gets made.

1878
01:49:59.593 --> 01:50:03.196
and I scrutinize
every little component in there.

[Johnny] Oh. tons
of different transistors.

1882
01:50:09.903 --> 01:50:14.608
you'll have transistors
or op amps.
sometimes toggle switches.

1883
01:50:14.608 --> 01:50:16.610
[Johnny]
Just changing a few values
here and there

1884
01:50:16.610 --> 01:50:20.614
can make it sound really smooth.
or splatty. or dark. or bright.

1885
01:50:20.614 --> 01:50:25.018
If you put a wrong value
in somewhere.
it's gonna change the sound.

1886
01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:27.287
Sometimes subtly.
sometimes pretty drastically.

1887
01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:29.322
It's a study in simplicity.

1888
01:50:29.322 --> 01:50:32.726
Every single thing
does something.

1889
01:50:32.726 --> 01:50:35.362
[Josh]    Subtleties
and it all comes down
to subtleties.

1890
01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:38.064
How is the attack on that?
Each repeat?

1891
01:50:38.064 --> 01:50:40.300
Then how's the release?

1892
01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:43.870
How is it escalating?
Is it degrading?
There's so many factors.

1893
01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:46.806
[PauAnd then that.
also. then lends itself
to the idea of.

1894
01:50:46.806 --> 01:50:49.109
well. there can be
a thousand
different manufacturers

1895
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:50.210
have the same effect.

1896
01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:53.880
because there can be
different circuits
for the same effect.

1897
01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:58.685
[Jeorge] Working in a company
that... that has been founded
on analog.

1898
01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:01.688
developing analog stuff
every single year.

1899
01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:03.957
you know. we get the e-mails.

1900
01:51:03.957 --> 01:51:08.161
"Hey. we're discontinuing
this transistor.
We're discontinuing this IC."

1901
01:51:08.161 --> 01:51:12.298
That technology is being lost.
so it's harder and harder to do.

1902
01:51:12.298 --> 01:51:15.068
and more. and more.
and more expensive.

1903
01:51:15.068 --> 01:51:17.337
so digital is really
is the future.

1904
01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:19.272
[slow music playing]

1905
01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:24.944
[Roger]
Towards the end of my years
of analog devices.

1906
01:51:24.944 --> 01:51:30.383
uh. we were working on a new.
uh. audio specific.
uh. DSP chip.

1907
01:51:30.383 --> 01:51:35.455
It occurred to me that this chip
could make the perfect brains

1908
01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:38.091
for a smart stompbox.

1909
01:51:38.091 --> 01:51:39.793
[Angelo]
DSP is a microcontroller

1910
01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:41.928
that's specifically designed
for audio

1911
01:51:41.928 --> 01:51:45.065
that you can then. you know.
dream up any algorithm
that you want.

1912
01:51:45.065 --> 01:51:47.233
[David] It really was
at this tipping point

1913
01:51:47.233 --> 01:51:50.470
where the power
of digital signal processors

1914
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:55.241
got to where they could start
to do very exciting things.

1915
01:51:55.241 --> 01:51:59.846
and either replicate some
sort of traditional functions

1916
01:51:59.846 --> 01:52:02.048
that had been done
in the analog domain.

1917
01:52:02.048 --> 01:52:04.384
but more excitingly. I think.

1918
01:52:04.384 --> 01:52:08.788
open up all kinds of new doors
of things.
um. that hadn't been tried.

1919
01:52:08.788 --> 01:52:12.992
[mellow music playing]

1920
01:52:18.331 --> 01:52:21.267
[Josh] I think
the significant moment

1921
01:52:21.267 --> 01:52:24.871
in DSP.
digital signal processing.

1922
01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:27.507
walking into a music store
as a player

1923
01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:31.878
and seeing the green Line-6 DL4.

1924
01:52:31.878 --> 01:52:35.782
[David]    So the Line-6 DL4
is essentially a delay pedal.

1925
01:52:35.782 --> 01:52:39.252
I didn't even know
that it had a looper function
in it

1926
01:52:39.252 --> 01:52:41.221
for years and years.

1927
01:52:41.221 --> 01:52:44.958
Somehow. I stumbled upon
what's this sampler knob
down here do.

1928
01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:48.361
And from there.
my mind just poof.

1929
01:52:48.361 --> 01:52:52.265
[quirky music playing]

1930
01:53:02.075 --> 01:53:06.913
[Josh] And out of Line-6
came so many other companies.

1931
01:53:06.913 --> 01:53:09.783
because Strymon comes out
of that group

1932
01:53:09.783 --> 01:53:14.154
and several other people come
from that brand new thing.

1933
01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:19.092
Right after I left Line-6.
I... I knew I wanted
to start my own company.

1934
01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:24.330
In 2008.
I joined up with the guys
from Damage Control

1935
01:53:24.330 --> 01:53:27.300
who now keep going
with the Strymon line.

1936
01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:29.836
[Gregg]
Then when there only was an amp.
you know. tape delays.

1937
01:53:29.836 --> 01:53:32.872
and... and Bucket-Brigades.
and everybody wanted digital.

1938
01:53:32.872 --> 01:53:34.908
And then when...
when you actually got it.

1939
01:53:34.908 --> 01:53:38.211
then you decided.
"Oh. well.
maybe I do want those flaws."

1940
01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:40.513
[laughs] So now.
we're taking all those.

1941
01:53:40.513 --> 01:53:43.149
you know. high technology
to sort of recreate
the... the flaws

1942
01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:44.984
that everybody thought
they didn't want.

1943
01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:47.287
um. when that was all
that was available.

1944
01:53:47.287 --> 01:53:49.055
There was only a few companies
that were even...

1945
01:53:49.055 --> 01:53:51.424
had sort of evolved
to that level of technology.

1946
01:53:51.424 --> 01:53:55.395
So our thing really was putting
this really high performance
processor

1947
01:53:55.395 --> 01:53:57.897
and dedicating it
to one algorithm.

1948
01:53:57.897 --> 01:54:01.534
Ah. it was digital.
but the way you interact
with the controls.

1949
01:54:01.534 --> 01:54:05.238
the way the controls interact
with each other. it felt analog.

1950
01:54:05.238 --> 01:54:07.907
[Nick]
This company Meris popped up
a couple of years ago.

1951
01:54:07.907 --> 01:54:11.311
They kind of like came
from Strymon and Line-6.

1952
01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:13.580
[Terry] I wanted to do things.

1953
01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:16.115
I think.
with a more creative focus
and more outside the box.

1954
01:54:16.115 --> 01:54:20.320
Every effect that we've made
was going to be an instrument
in and of itself.

1956
01:54:33.099 --> 01:54:37.570
[man 26] Affordable DSP has
changed the whole pedal game.

1957
01:54:37.570 --> 01:54:44.377
and having digital technology
almost be indistinguishable
from analog

1958
01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:50.049
has made a lot of really
interesting new effects come out
in the last five years.

There's only so many things
you can really do

1961
01:55:37.563 --> 01:55:39.966
unless you start making
these crazy insane pedals.

1962
01:55:39.966 --> 01:55:44.437
By making these pedals.
it expands what people
are able to do with music.

[EmilOld Blood Noise
Endeavors. I think.

1964
01:55:46.306 --> 01:55:49.542
just blows my mind continuously
with what they release.

1965
01:55:49.542 --> 01:55:52.412
I think
that we have a good sweet spot.

1966
01:55:52.412 --> 01:55:56.249
sort of. in the weird section
of effects.

1967
01:55:56.249 --> 01:56:01.387
so some would say near sure.
like. unusable
or unmusical things

1968
01:56:01.387 --> 01:56:06.559
that kind of push the boundaries
on what you're expected
to like out of an effect.

1969
01:56:06.559 --> 01:56:10.129
[Angelo] I'm excited
when I see other builders'

1970

show through.

1971
01:56:12.432 --> 01:56:14.367
like. if it's
something unique idea.

1972
01:56:14.367 --> 01:56:16.602
I say. "Oh. man.
I can... I can see
that person behind it.

Chase Bliss. I don't think
they make a bad pedal.

1974
01:56:40.259 --> 01:56:43.262
And I am just in awe

1975
01:56:43.262 --> 01:56:47.367
of what they've been
able to accomplish
in the past several years.

1976
01:56:47.367 --> 01:56:49.202
[Joel] I wasn't a very good
student in college.

1977
01:56:49.202 --> 01:56:51.471
I didn't learn very much. heh.

1978
01:56:51.471 --> 01:56:55.575
about audio electronics
in college.

1979
01:56:55.575 --> 01:56:59.045
I basically approached Zach Vex.

1980
01:56:59.045 --> 01:57:02.081
and was like. "Hey. you know.
undergraduate degree
in electrical engineering.

1981
01:57:02.081 --> 01:57:05.118
I'm like. I'll work
for anything. like.
I just wanna learn.

1982
01:57:05.118 --> 01:57:07.320
I... I...
this is what I care about."

1983
01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:09.088
What I did
was I pulled out schematics

1984
01:57:09.088 --> 01:57:11.391
of my favorite...
favorite vibrato.

1985
01:57:11.391 --> 01:57:13.393
which was made my BOSS.
but it was discontinued.

1986
01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:15.762
Basically. I gave him a stack
of schematics

1987
01:57:15.762 --> 01:57:17.764
that would have circles drawn
on them.
like steal this. steal this.

1988
01:57:17.764 --> 01:57:19.799
steal this... this. steal this.
and build the whole circuit.

1989
01:57:19.799 --> 01:57:21.768
So Joel Korte
took all those ideas
that I gave him

1990
01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:24.637
and put it all together
as that... as that circuit.

1991
01:57:24.637 --> 01:57:27.040
[JoeHe made things
that were interesting for him.

1992
01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:30.576
And like. he didn't necessarily
worry too much

1993
01:57:30.576 --> 01:57:33.046
about how they were
gonna be received.

1994
01:57:33.046 --> 01:57:35.681
because he knew
that if he was really excited
about it.

1995
01:57:35.681 --> 01:57:39.385
and it's something that he loved
and he really cared about.
that...

1996
01:57:39.385 --> 01:57:41.621
that was gonna resonate
with people.

1997
01:57:41.621 --> 01:57:44.590
A few months
before I was gonna graduate.

1998
01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:48.795
my brother was killed
by a drunk driver.

1999
01:57:48.795 --> 01:57:52.698
For a year after that.
I was basically just...

2000
01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:56.736
I don't know.
it was just everything.
you know?

2001
01:57:56.736 --> 01:58:00.807
He was really into this guy
named Joseph Campbell.

2002
01:58:00.807 --> 01:58:07.280
who. uh. is really known
for the phrase.
"Follow your bliss."

2003
01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:10.416
I just really realized
that I wasn't doing that at all.

2004
01:58:10.416 --> 01:58:14.687
I have no interest
in trying to make something
that that's already out there.

2005
01:58:14.687 --> 01:58:17.123
You know. I wanna be talked
about as an innovator.

2006
01:58:17.123 --> 01:58:19.725
and... and if I don't.
then I won't be.

2007
01:58:19.725 --> 01:58:23.463
[upbeat music playing]

2008
01:58:42.281 --> 01:58:45.751
[Ben] And 2002.
to when I kicked in.

2009
01:58:45.751 --> 01:58:48.554
as I say. there was only
a handful of people
doing boutique stuff.

2010
01:58:48.554 --> 01:58:50.656
maybe 20. 25 people.

2011
01:58:50.656 --> 01:58:53.593
and fast forward to now at 2020.

2012
01:58:53.593 --> 01:58:58.331
and as a site. as thousands
and thousands of people.
And how can this be?

2013
01:58:58.331 --> 01:59:02.535
By 2012. '13. I was like.
"Where are these people
coming from?"

2014
01:59:02.535 --> 01:59:07.707
It was the... the speed
of knowledge on the internet.

2015
01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:12.278
[rock music playing]

2016
01:59:18.251 --> 01:59:20.853
[Blake]
Rewinding to the mid-2000s.

2017
01:59:20.853 --> 01:59:24.457
ProGuitarShop basically
started doing pedal demos.

2018
01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:26.392
I mean. there were some others.

2019
01:59:26.392 --> 01:59:28.494
but they were the ones
that started doing
nicely produced.

2020
01:59:28.494 --> 01:59:31.430
very good audio.
good playing pedal demos.

2021
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:33.866
And the man doing that
was Andy Martin.

2022
01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:38.571
There's so many demo guys now.
but almost everybody
can point back to Andy.

2023
01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:39.939
[man 27] But first.
here's the clean tone.

2024
01:59:44.877 --> 01:59:47.613
[Andy] The whole reason
I started doing demos
in the first place

2025
01:59:47.613 --> 01:59:50.550
is 'cause we... we saw
this big boom of pedal makers

2026
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:52.318
that you couldn't find
in your local store.

2027
01:59:52.318 --> 01:59:54.587
We saw there was only
a few people doing that

2028
01:59:54.587 --> 01:59:57.390
on this new thing
called YouTube.
you know. this was like 2007.

2029
01:59:57.390 --> 02:00:00.826
You know. Aaron Miller
from ProGuitarShop realized
that I was into film too.

2030
02:00:00.826 --> 02:00:04.864
but I was also in the music
and this... this new job
that he'd kind of just came

2031
02:00:04.864 --> 02:00:08.467
created out of thin air
was like the perfect marriage
of those skills

2032
02:00:08.467 --> 02:00:10.369
that. you know. we kind of
raised the bar a little bit.

2033
02:00:10.369 --> 02:00:12.205
because we weren't using
the camera mics.

2034
02:00:12.205 --> 02:00:14.740
and. uh. we were recording
these pedals professionally.

2035
02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:16.676
and we wanted it
to be a resource.

2036
02:00:16.676 --> 02:00:20.346
My pedal demo hero
is... is Andy Martin.

2037
02:00:20.346 --> 02:00:22.782
And I'd be like. "well. I wonder
what those...
this one sounds like."

2038
02:00:22.782 --> 02:00:25.585
Type in Andy. and I'll go like.
"Oh. that's
what it sounded like."

2039
02:00:25.585 --> 02:00:27.753
and then. you know.
it was almost like
trying it yourself.

2040
02:00:27.753 --> 02:00:30.423
[Emily]
YouTube demos and video demos

2041
02:00:30.423 --> 02:00:34.293
are a great way for people
who don't have
that accessibility

2042
02:00:34.293 --> 02:00:37.863
to go through
and physically play
15 different fuzz pedals

2043
02:00:37.863 --> 02:00:39.966
before... until they get
the sound that's right for them.

2044
02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:42.535
[Pete]    This gear reviewer
or a gear demonstrator

2045
02:00:42.535 --> 02:00:44.337
was... was now a profession.

2046
02:00:44.337 --> 02:00:46.305
5and it was just something
that I stumbled into.

2047
02:00:46.305 --> 02:00:50.876
I think YouTube changed the game
as YouTube stars now.

2048
02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:54.614
like those.
what are those two dudes
in England who reviewed pedals?

2049
02:00:54.614 --> 02:00:58.584
They're just like soccer dads
and shit.
but like their channel is huge.

2050
02:00:58.584 --> 02:00:59.952
Hi. guys.
welcome to That Pedal Show .

2051
02:00:59.952 --> 02:01:01.821
-Dan here.
-Mick here. Hello. and welcome.

2052
02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:03.456
[Ryan]    If you work
with a great demo

2053
02:01:03.456 --> 02:01:05.291
or that has. uh.
an excellent fan base.

2054
02:01:05.291 --> 02:01:06.892
then you know
that you're gonna be in front

2055
02:01:06.892 --> 02:01:10.363
of 1.000. 10.000.
80.000. 100.000 people.

2056
02:01:10.363 --> 02:01:12.498
[man 28] And I think
why it's so successful

2057
02:01:12.498 --> 02:01:14.767
and why all these channels
are popping up

2058
02:01:14.767 --> 02:01:17.903
is because
this whole pedal community
has been around forever.

2059
02:01:17.903 --> 02:01:19.739
but they didn't have
the platform.

2060
02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:21.374
They didn't have the internet.

2061
02:01:21.374 --> 02:01:22.608
They didn't have things
like YouTube.

2062
02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:28.981
[Scott]
There's now tons of channels

2063
02:01:28.981 --> 02:01:31.284
that are really just about
kind of laying things out
for you.

2064
02:01:31.284 --> 02:01:32.918
and helping you make decisions

2065
02:01:32.918 --> 02:01:35.554
about whether
this is a good pedal
for you or not.

2066
02:01:35.554 --> 02:01:38.391
I think it was just gonna be.
well. let's just keep doing this

2067
02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:41.827
until we run out of pedals.
and I... I still haven't.

2068
02:01:41.827 --> 02:01:45.331
[rock music playing]

2069
02:01:52.705 --> 02:01:54.573
People have
a collector's mentality.

2070
02:01:54.573 --> 02:01:57.943
and that has helped enormously
in the boutique pedal industry.

2071
02:01:57.943 --> 02:02:00.913
[Steve]    The vintage market
really didn't start happening

2072
02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:03.783
until. you know.
the... the 2000s.

2073
02:02:03.783 --> 02:02:07.987
and... and some of this stuff
that is now really coveted
is... is going up in price.

2074
02:02:07.987 --> 02:02:11.991
Well. you know. I mean.
we all start collecting stuff
that our heroes used.

2075
02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:13.959
you know. just the folklore
that gets it going.

2076
02:02:13.959 --> 02:02:18.097
[rock music playing]

2077
02:02:27.773 --> 02:02:31.010
[Josh] The Klon is fun.
It might be the greatest pedal.

2078
02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:35.881
because it's...
it's this mix of hype
and why is it hyped?

2079
02:02:35.881 --> 02:02:38.684
And does it sound good or not?
And...

2080
02:02:39.652 --> 02:02:41.620
you take the back off.
it's gooped.

2081
02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:45.624
You can't know what it is.
and Bill's attention to detail.

2082
02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:48.761
ah. why he put the LED here.
why it's in a big case.

2083
02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:52.998
And I've heard now
a million people weigh in
and say. "Oh. it's jive.

2084
02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:55.735
That thing's a piece of crap.
and it's all hype."

2085
02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:58.771
And I've heard people say.
"Oh. it's just.
it's so beautiful.

2086
02:02:58.771 --> 02:03:00.740
because it's so versatile."

2087
02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:04.076
And it has that
the... the dreaded word.
transparent qualities.

2088
02:03:04.076 --> 02:03:07.079
Then I have to definitely agree
with the... the latter camp.

2089
02:03:07.079 --> 02:03:10.015
[Brian]
I've talked to Bill Finnegan
who. uh. owns Klon.

2090
02:03:10.015 --> 02:03:13.853
I think he never really intended
for his pedals to sell

2091
02:03:13.853 --> 02:03:16.489
for $3.000. $4.000
on the used market.

2092
02:03:16.489 --> 02:03:18.891
Like he was just creating art.

2093
02:03:18.891 --> 02:03:20.760
Man. I guess it's worth it.

2094
02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:23.162
because it's...
it's traded regularly
at that price

2095
02:03:23.162 --> 02:03:25.798
that. I think.
that it's also
a brilliant circuit.

2096
02:03:25.798 --> 02:03:30.069
but you can find it in a Tumnus
and in one of my pedals even.

2097
02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:34.073
[Brian] I really don't like
doing a lot of stuff
that's based on something else

2098
02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:36.475
unless
there's substantial changes.

2099
02:03:36.475 --> 02:03:40.546
So I did the Tumnus
because that's what my customers
were asking me for.

2100
02:03:40.546 --> 02:03:43.582
And at the end of the day.
I live to serve my customers.

2101
02:03:43.582 --> 02:03:46.552
If I don't serve my customers.
I'm not gonna have a business.

2102
02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:50.489
[rock music playing]

2103
02:03:57.129 --> 02:04:04.036
There's this great doubt
that the Klon clone
is actually this.

2104
02:04:04.036 --> 02:04:09.508
and it's the psychological thing
that's really important.
uh. for the pedal industry.

2105
02:04:09.508 --> 02:04:12.845
you know. it's some mystery.
It's something special.

2106
02:04:12.845 --> 02:04:15.147
But I do think
there is some legit criticism.

2107
02:04:15.147 --> 02:04:20.052
and that there's some things
that have become confused
for public property.

2108
02:04:20.052 --> 02:04:24.156
or. uh. categories
when really they're trademarks.

2109
02:04:24.156 --> 02:04:29.128
[Steve] Meanwhile. I'm guilty
of playing telecasters
that are not made by Fender.

2110
02:04:29.128 --> 02:04:32.231
We're all frequently playing
and using instruments and amps

2111
02:04:32.231 --> 02:04:34.667
and things that are made
by other people

2112
02:04:34.667 --> 02:04:37.970
that are variations
or derivations
of things that came before.

2113
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:40.539
A friend of mine
worked at a pawn shop.

2114
02:04:40.539 --> 02:04:43.042
and he called me and he said.
"This pedal is really fucked up.
You should try it."

2115
02:04:43.042 --> 02:04:45.244
It's called
the Harmonic Percolator. HP-1.

2116
02:04:45.244 --> 02:04:47.146
That pedal traveled the world
with me.

2117
02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:48.981
I made a bunch of records
with it.

2118
02:04:48.981 --> 02:04:51.250
People ask me about it
because it was kind of unusual.

2119
02:04:51.250 --> 02:04:55.688
but along the way. this weird
sort of cult interest
in this one named pedal

2120
02:04:55.688 --> 02:05:02.027
created a kind of mini industry
of people making their version
of this circuit.

2121
02:05:02.027 --> 02:05:03.596
Obviously.
there's a lot of people

2122
02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:06.265
doing clones and stuff.
that's derivative.

2123
02:05:06.265 --> 02:05:08.834
but there are. you know.
there are a decent chunk
of people

2124
02:05:08.834 --> 02:05:12.638
doing some really. really cool.
unique and interesting things.

2125
02:05:12.638 --> 02:05:16.642
[Phillipe]
My big peeve isn't necessarily
about the people who might copy

2126
02:05:16.642 --> 02:05:19.645
or make clones of other things.

2127
02:05:19.645 --> 02:05:22.114
My big peeve

2128
02:05:22.114 --> 02:05:26.852
is when people say.
"Well. everybody does it."
because not everybody does it.

2129
02:05:26.852 --> 02:05:29.154
[Jack] I can sum that up
in one sentence.

2130
02:05:29.154 --> 02:05:31.657
Those who can do
those who can't.

2131
02:05:34.527 --> 02:05:37.029
[Brian]
I can go on Instagram right now.
and there's like...

2132
02:05:37.029 --> 02:05:40.633
Well. there's like
a hundred thousand hashtags
about pedals.

2133
02:05:40.633 --> 02:05:42.635
And when I compare that

2134
02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:47.840
and think about 1962 Gibson
releasing Maestro Fuzz-Tone

2135
02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.175
to some dealers
and nobody buys it.

2136
02:05:50.175 --> 02:05:53.612
It's so different.
It's radically different.

2137
02:05:53.612 --> 02:05:56.248
[Aisha]
Having the Instagram profile
allowed me to connect

2138
02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:58.617
with more people
who are into this.

2139
02:05:58.617 --> 02:06:03.856
And I realized. oh. my gosh.
it's a huge worldwide community.

2140
02:06:03.856 --> 02:06:07.560
[Jamie]    If you want to do
the thing that you like to do
and get paid to do it

2141
02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:09.295
like you have to put yourself
out there.

2142
02:06:09.295 --> 02:06:11.263
And right now. the way
to put yourself out there

2143
02:06:11.263 --> 02:06:13.799
is to make a bunch of "content"

2144
02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:16.902
and put it on social media.
like. that's it.

2145
02:06:16.902 --> 02:06:18.871
That's the new magazine.

2146
02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:22.608
[Piera] Some of these places
are... are 90% marketing.

2147
02:06:22.608 --> 02:06:24.977
and. you know.
they have their social media.

2148
02:06:24.977 --> 02:06:28.080
They put out great videos
on YouTube
and on their websites.

2149
02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:30.649
so they're really good
at promotion and marketing.

2150
02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:34.787
And I think it's still growing
because these guys
are getting everybody excited.

2151
02:06:34.787 --> 02:06:38.057
and there's so many new pedals
coming out.
People are... are still trying.

2152
02:06:38.057 --> 02:06:40.326
And so it's... it's a big change
in the business I'm seeing.

2153
02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:42.962
Starting a company

2154
02:06:42.962 --> 02:06:49.301
that becomes successful
because of the internet
has an equally negative side.

2155
02:06:49.301 --> 02:06:53.138
You know. the very thing
that lets you be seen.

2156
02:06:53.138 --> 02:06:56.141
throws your pedal out
in front of all these people

2157
02:06:56.141 --> 02:07:00.079
is the very thing
that throws your product out

2158
02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:02.181
in front of people
who are gonna hate you.

2159
02:07:02.181 --> 02:07:05.250
There's... there's these people
that are like chained
to the wall.

2160
02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:07.353
eating dog food
in their mother's basement.

2161
02:07:07.353 --> 02:07:09.955
They're just sitting there
typing away

2162
02:07:09.955 --> 02:07:13.225
as... as to why
the Tube Screamer
is still the best pedal ever.

2163
02:07:13.225 --> 02:07:15.761
[Josh] There's not a builder
that I know

2164
02:07:15.761 --> 02:07:19.832
that doesn't cringe
when they're tagged
on the gear page.

2165
02:07:19.832 --> 02:07:21.333
"Oh. Keeley did it again.

2166
02:07:21.333 --> 02:07:23.769
He put dipswitches
on the inside of his pedal.

2167
02:07:23.769 --> 02:07:26.672
Um. I won't be buying any
of those Keeley pedals."

2168
02:07:26.672 --> 02:07:29.375
I feel like forums
used to be extremely helpful.

2169
02:07:29.375 --> 02:07:31.677
I thought that they were like.

2170
02:07:31.677 --> 02:07:33.979
you know.
a lot of like-minded people
with a lot of knowledge.

2171
02:07:33.979 --> 02:07:35.981
Somewhere. out of nowhere.

2172
02:07:35.981 --> 02:07:38.417
it really just devolved
into people

2173
02:07:38.417 --> 02:07:41.820
arguing over whose opinion
is the right one.

2174
02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:44.657
And you know. like.
what's cool and what's not cool.

2175
02:07:44.657 --> 02:07:49.028
And people making.
like. decisions on. like.
how ethical a company is

2176
02:07:49.028 --> 02:07:50.763
without knowing anything
about them.

2177
02:07:50.763 --> 02:07:54.400
just like what they feel
about them.

2178
02:07:54.400 --> 02:08:00.372
There's a small section
of the population
that wanna watch the world burn.

2179
02:08:00.372 --> 02:08:04.677
and you provide them
with. uh. you know.
lifetime supply of matches.

2180
02:08:04.677 --> 02:08:06.045
and what are you going to get?

2181
02:08:06.045 --> 02:08:08.347
So it's a sports bar
with guitars.

2182
02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:12.084
It's like... it's... it's like
the most hyper-masculine
environment

2183
02:08:12.084 --> 02:08:13.919
that you could imagine.

2184
02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:15.287
Forever. the philosophy

2185
02:08:15.287 --> 02:08:17.289
that I had for myself
and my work was.

2186
02:08:17.289 --> 02:08:19.958
work
and tell no one what you do.

2187
02:08:20.793 --> 02:08:25.431
When it comes to... to women
who are actually building
and in companies.

2188
02:08:25.431 --> 02:08:32.004
I probably
couldn't have named a woman
other than Fran or Devi Ever

2189
02:08:32.004 --> 02:08:35.040
until about ten years ago.

2190
02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:38.410
[Aisha]
I started the Instagram profile
and got on there

2191
02:08:38.410 --> 02:08:40.879
and immediately started looking
for other lady builders.

2192
02:08:40.879 --> 02:08:43.982
and. you know.
non-binary people of color.

2193
02:08:43.982 --> 02:08:51.724
and realized. "Oh. boy.
there's just like
not very many of us.

2194
02:08:51.724 --> 02:08:55.394
[Victoria]
Men think that this is something
that women don't do.

2195
02:08:55.394 --> 02:08:57.262
People come into here.

2196
02:08:57.262 --> 02:08:59.998
and I'm like window dressing.

2197
02:08:59.998 --> 02:09:05.270
And you basically have to be
like. "Oh. hey.
I'm part of alchemy too."

2198
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:07.406
[Nathalie]
People just generally
don't want to talk to you

2199
02:09:07.406 --> 02:09:08.974
if they come up
and they have. like.

2200
02:09:08.974 --> 02:09:10.943
a technical question
about the pedals.

2201
02:09:10.943 --> 02:09:13.812
Even if you're standing there.
they'll kind of look beyond you

2202
02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:17.049
for someone else
who can help them.
That's really kind of hard.

2203
02:09:17.049 --> 02:09:20.219
I want to talk about pedals
and I want to like.

2204
02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:22.387
you know. like demo for people.

2205
02:09:22.387 --> 02:09:24.490
but. yeah.
it's kind of... it's difficult

2206
02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:28.227
to feel like you have a role
in that sort of situation.

2207
02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:30.229
I never wanted
to do the marketing.

2208
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:35.834
because I knew
what the guitar stores
and the distributors were like.

2209
02:09:35.834 --> 02:09:38.270
A possible distributor
that I spoke to.

2210
02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:40.773
he was like. "Yeah.
someone had told me
just to come by

2211
02:09:40.773 --> 02:09:42.841
because you are really pretty.
kapow!"

2212
02:09:42.841 --> 02:09:47.546
and then just walked away.
And I was like. "What?
Like. okay.

2213
02:09:47.546 --> 02:09:54.319
I mean. the imbalance is there
for the same reasons
it exists elsewhere.

2214
02:09:55.821 --> 02:09:58.056
[laughs]

2215
02:09:58.056 --> 02:10:01.927
[Fabi]
When I look at between the '30s
and even the '70s. you know.

2216
02:10:01.927 --> 02:10:04.296
at that time.
socially and culturally.

2217
02:10:04.296 --> 02:10:07.399
women just weren't allowed
to pick up tools.

2218
02:10:07.399 --> 02:10:11.136
much less be building
and designing instruments.
you know?

2219
02:10:11.136 --> 02:10:14.173
That means that there were men
creating communities.

2220
02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:18.243
teaching one another.
creating magazines.
creating brands.

2221
02:10:18.243 --> 02:10:20.112
and it was exclusively men

2222
02:10:20.112 --> 02:10:22.581
for no other reason
other than that's the only thing

2223
02:10:22.581 --> 02:10:24.883
that was socially
and culturally accepted.

2224
02:10:24.883 --> 02:10:27.486
Of course. as a marketing tool.

2225
02:10:27.486 --> 02:10:30.923
you want to market that
to the people
that have been creating it.

2226
02:10:30.923 --> 02:10:34.159
and the society
that it is now.
the guitar industry.

2227
02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:37.329
which is a bunch
of young white men
at that time. right?

2228
02:10:37.329 --> 02:10:40.299
You fast forward then
to the 2019.

2229
02:10:40.299 --> 02:10:42.935
those people.
those men are older.

2230
02:10:42.935 --> 02:10:48.040
And now. in the past five years.
it's becoming
culturally accepted

2231
02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:52.244
for women
to be picking up tools.
to be designing. to be playing.

2232
02:10:52.244 --> 02:10:54.980
And now.
you start seeing more women.

2233
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:57.316
Right? Now. you start seeing
those communities grow.

2234
02:10:57.316 --> 02:11:03.222
It is a guitar and a pedal
manufacturing industry issue.

2235
02:11:03.222 --> 02:11:07.292
but it's societal
and a cultural issue
more than anything.

2236
02:11:07.292 --> 02:11:09.595
If it was the opposite.
I wouldn't be in this chair.

2237
02:11:09.595 --> 02:11:12.297
It would be you instead.
and I would be asking you
questions. [laughs]

2238
02:11:13.198 --> 02:11:16.969
[Emily] If you want to sell
more guitar pedals.

2239
02:11:16.969 --> 02:11:21.206
you need to increase
who you're advertising to.

2240
02:11:21.206 --> 02:11:25.177
[Sarah]
I'm so used to music companies
not really considering us

2241
02:11:25.177 --> 02:11:27.145
when they're developing
their products.

2242
02:11:27.145 --> 02:11:29.281
or putting out their products.
or marketing their products.

2243
02:11:29.281 --> 02:11:32.384
God.
it's like a breath of fresh air
where we are right now.

2244
02:11:32.384 --> 02:11:35.587
and just how the culture
has... has changed.

2245
02:11:35.587 --> 02:11:38.223
[Fabi]    I think that people
can relate and connect

2246
02:11:38.223 --> 02:11:40.025
to that specific issue
right away.

2247
02:11:40.025 --> 02:11:41.526
but once you start talking
about it

2248
02:11:41.526 --> 02:11:43.495
and started really digging
into it.

2249
02:11:43.495 --> 02:11:46.298
you start to realize
that it's not just a woman's
issue.

2250
02:11:46.298 --> 02:11:48.433
It's really a cultural
and societal issue.

2251
02:11:49.601 --> 02:11:53.338
[Lance] But half that handful
of black and brown people

2252
02:11:53.338 --> 02:11:55.974
who are interested
in making pedals.

2253
02:11:55.974 --> 02:12:00.979
who have just been happy to see
that they aren't
the only ones doing that.

2254
02:12:00.979 --> 02:12:04.616
I think part of why there's not
a whole lot of people
of color building

2255
02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:10.923
isn't anything
necessarily inherent
to building guitar pedals.

2256
02:12:10.923 --> 02:12:16.028
I think it's just an issue of it
being more difficult
for people of color

2257
02:12:16.028 --> 02:12:18.630
to be able to get businesses up
and running.

2258
02:12:18.630 --> 02:12:21.099
[Fran] And the world
is slow to change.

2259
02:12:21.099 --> 02:12:22.567
People have
to really be different.

2260
02:12:22.567 --> 02:12:24.436
It's not a matter
of just acting different.

2261
02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:28.273
You gotta... you gotta evolve.
and evolution takes time.

2262
02:12:28.273 --> 02:12:30.208
Kids who are in their 20s
starting out now.

2263
02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:33.045
when they get to my age.
it'll be different.

2264
02:12:33.045 --> 02:12:35.347
[Lance]
You can't spend your life

2265
02:12:35.347 --> 02:12:38.250
thinking about what other people
are gonna think about you.

2266
02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:42.321
and whether
your pedal company takes off.

2267
02:12:42.321 --> 02:12:44.523
or whether
you just end up making pedals

2268
02:12:44.523 --> 02:12:47.526
that are pretty much
for yourself
or for your friends.

2269
02:12:47.526 --> 02:12:49.661
If you enjoy doing it.
you should do it.

2270
02:12:49.661 --> 02:12:53.598
[mellow music playing]

2271
02:13:06.211 --> 02:13:09.748
I like to view my pedalboard
as like those
are my instruments.

2272
02:13:09.748 --> 02:13:12.417
and the guitar
is the sound source.

2273
02:13:12.417 --> 02:13:17.022
It was really a way
to come up with sounds

2274
02:13:17.022 --> 02:13:19.391
that didn't necessarily sound
like a guitar.

2275
02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:22.594
It didn't necessarily sound
like music
that was already out there.

2276
02:13:22.594 --> 02:13:26.164
[quirky music playing]

2277
02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:30.769
[Nels]
Nick Reinhart comes to mind.

2278
02:13:30.769 --> 02:13:33.205
We've...
I made a record with Nick.
and I didn't know Nick at all.

2279
02:13:33.205 --> 02:13:36.541
And I realized. Oh. my God.
there's a whole generation
of players

2280
02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:40.679
who are effects pedal players.
not just guitar players.

2281
02:13:40.679 --> 02:13:44.249
It's literally
a whole other thing
of just hobbyists.

2282
02:13:44.249 --> 02:13:46.184
and people
that aren't even musicians

2283
02:13:46.184 --> 02:13:49.354
they just wanna make noise
and create something.

2284
02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:52.524
you know. what do you call
some of these effects?
I don't even know.

2285
02:13:52.524 --> 02:13:57.329
[soft music playing]

2286
02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:21.787
[David]    The pedals
aren't only for guitarists.

2287
02:14:21.787 --> 02:14:24.489
I mean. it's amazing
to see different people
utilize them

2288
02:14:24.489 --> 02:14:26.425
in ways that are unique to them.

2289
02:14:26.425 --> 02:14:28.760
and... and to see
what results people can get.

2290
02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:31.329
I think
it's just an inspiring community

2291
02:14:31.329 --> 02:14:33.265
that will keep morphing
and changing.

2292
02:14:33.265 --> 02:14:37.569
but that has really helped
shape. uh. modern music.

2293
02:14:37.569 --> 02:14:41.239
Nowadays.
as much as one can dream.

2294
02:14:41.239 --> 02:14:44.643
one can make sounds
that maybe no one's
even ever heard before.

2295
02:14:44.643 --> 02:14:49.614
The possibilities
are becoming absolutely vast.
if not endless.

2296
02:14:50.816 --> 02:14:54.186
It was definitely. you know.
in like 2014. 2015.

2297
02:14:54.186 --> 02:14:57.656
where I really thought.
holy crap.
like this is a revolution.

2298
02:14:57.656 --> 02:15:03.361
[John] This pedal boom.
and the mass amount
of pedal companies

2299
02:15:03.361 --> 02:15:09.401
holds some evidence
that people wanna connect
with a personality.

2300
02:15:09.401 --> 02:15:12.571
JHS is not Walrus.
Walrus has
a different personality.

2301
02:15:12.571 --> 02:15:15.607
You look at EarthQuaker.
or you look at Oliver
of Death by Audio.

2302
02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:17.809
Robert Keeley. Brian Wampler.

2303
02:15:17.809 --> 02:15:23.548
you couldn't have
more different personas
of a pedal company.

2304
02:15:23.548 --> 02:15:26.151
[David]    Every pedal
is like a different food. right?

2305
02:15:26.151 --> 02:15:30.222
It's got different flavors
and characteristics
that you love.

2306
02:15:30.222 --> 02:15:35.293
I have three different
distortion. overdrive pedals
on my board.

2307
02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:37.195
and. you know.
that's because each one

2308
02:15:37.195 --> 02:15:40.732
is suited to a different type
of riff or song.

2309
02:15:40.732 --> 02:15:43.135
[Julie]
You can have a bunch of pedals.

2310
02:15:43.135 --> 02:15:46.805
you know. like nobody
is gonna have a pedalboard
that has just one brand.

2311
02:15:46.805 --> 02:15:49.641
You can have a billion pedals.

2312
02:15:49.641 --> 02:15:52.477
[Josh]
Yeah. I've had conversations.
like. is there a pedal bubble?

2313
02:15:52.477 --> 02:15:54.679
Is the industry gonna implode?

2314
02:15:54.679 --> 02:15:56.481
[Julie] It is a bit
of a relief to know

2315
02:15:56.481 --> 02:15:59.784
that there was. like.
a time that pedals died.

2316
02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:02.621
but then they came back.

2317
02:16:02.621 --> 02:16:07.626
But I think that there's always
going to be enough people
that want to stomp on something.

2318
02:16:07.626 --> 02:16:10.295
manipulate it with their hands.

2319
02:16:10.295 --> 02:16:16.568
get all these different sounds
by swapping out different boxes
that will be safe.

2320
02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:20.272
[Phillipe]    A lot of genres
related to rock 'n' roll
are showing sales declines.

2321
02:16:20.272 --> 02:16:22.574
But meanwhile.
the pedal industry
keeps going up.

2322
02:16:22.574 --> 02:16:25.377
and I think it speaks to
that they just love playing.

2323
02:16:25.377 --> 02:16:27.946
They love making noise
with these things

2324
02:16:27.946 --> 02:16:30.415
and plugging in and doing stuff.

2325
02:16:30.415 --> 02:16:33.852
For I can make something
that gives someone space

2326
02:16:33.852 --> 02:16:36.955
to create something
and be inspired and create art.

2327
02:16:36.955 --> 02:16:39.591
then that's very meaningful
to me.

2328
02:16:39.591 --> 02:16:42.294
[RyaAnd it's crazy.
because technically.
we are all in direct competition

2329
02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:44.563
with one another.
especially... some of us
more than others.

2330
02:16:44.563 --> 02:16:46.731
This pedal community.

2331
02:16:46.731 --> 02:16:49.734
for the most part.
we all play really nicely
together.

2332
02:16:49.734 --> 02:16:54.206
E-mails back and forth. texts.
where did you get
these transistors?

2333
02:16:54.206 --> 02:17:00.345
What do you think
about this dealer in France?
I don't like him.

2334
02:17:00.345 --> 02:17:02.214
Are you sourcing this part
from here?

2335
02:17:02.214 --> 02:17:03.782
Well. I can get you this thing
over here.

2336
02:17:03.782 --> 02:17:05.517
You don't find that
in other industries.

2337
02:17:05.517 --> 02:17:07.852
It's not...
that's not a common thing.

2338
02:17:07.852 --> 02:17:10.622
If you're selling insurance.
you aren't calling out
other insurance companies

2339
02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:13.825
and seeing what they're doing
to gain success. [chuckles]

2340
02:17:13.825 --> 02:17:17.896
[Craig]    If this universe
is gonna continue to expand.

2341
02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:20.999
it needs to look
into doing things
that haven't been done before.

2342
02:17:20.999 --> 02:17:22.901
Not everybody thought
about going to the corner store

2343
02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:25.003
and getting
a Texas Instrument op-amp.

2344
02:17:25.003 --> 02:17:26.905
but they were there
if you wanted them.

2345
02:17:26.905 --> 02:17:29.908
It would not surprise me
if say ten years from now.

2346
02:17:29.908 --> 02:17:32.477
there's another
Electronic Projects
For Musicians type book

2347
02:17:32.477 --> 02:17:35.247
based on using
software algorithms

2348
02:17:35.247 --> 02:17:40.252
and making it as easy
for people to use
as that book did.

2349
02:17:40.252 --> 02:17:42.721
[man 29] Going forward.

2350
02:17:42.721 --> 02:17:45.590
all of those elements go
into a melting pot.
and that's what inspires us.

2351
02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:47.792
and that's what keeps us going.

2352
02:17:47.792 --> 02:17:50.795
The need and desire
to make the best
of what's possible.

2353
02:17:50.795 --> 02:17:54.666
the need and desire
to do our best
by our customers.

2354
02:17:54.666 --> 02:17:59.471
the need and desire
to stand shoulder to shoulder
with our peers.

2355
02:17:59.471 --> 02:18:01.640
[Brian] I think pedals
have been completely integrated

2356
02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:04.643
into musical instruments
at this stage.

2357
02:18:04.643 --> 02:18:07.679
[Sarah]
All these real world scenarios

2358
02:18:07.679 --> 02:18:10.815
have been captured
via circuit boards

2359
02:18:10.815 --> 02:18:13.285
and placed
in these little metal boxes.

2360
02:18:13.285 --> 02:18:15.987
And I can put them on a board.
and play my guitar in.

2361
02:18:15.987 --> 02:18:20.558
and have access
to like a million different
sonic scenarios.

2362
02:18:20.558 --> 02:18:23.495
[Emily]
I think it's a great time
for guitarists.

2363
02:18:23.495 --> 02:18:27.966
and part of that
is because it's a great time
for... for guitar pedals.

2364
02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:30.368
[David] I mean. I wouldn't be
the guitar player I am

2365
02:18:30.368 --> 02:18:32.971
without being exposed
to these little boxes.

2366
02:18:32.971 --> 02:18:35.407
Popular music would just sound.

2367
02:18:35.407 --> 02:18:38.543
I think. a little bit stale
without all the different
flavors

2368
02:18:38.543 --> 02:18:40.845
that you can get out
of the pedals.

2369
02:18:40.845 --> 02:18:42.847
[NelTo me.
without imagination

2370
02:18:42.847 --> 02:18:44.683
what good are effects pedals.

2371
02:18:44.683 --> 02:18:47.018
but if you have it.
this is a beautiful time.

2372
02:18:47.018 --> 02:18:49.054
This is like a Renaissance.

2373
02:18:49.054 --> 02:18:54.326
Uh. the possibilities
of creative wonder
are off the scale.

2374
02:18:54.326 --> 02:18:58.697
The good news is.
you have a million options.
you know?

2375
02:18:58.697 --> 02:19:00.765
So that's
either gonna drive you crazy

2376
02:19:00.765 --> 02:19:02.734
or it's gonna make you
so excited.

2377
02:19:02.734 --> 02:19:06.004
and say.
this is the best time ever
to be a guitar player.

2378
02:19:07.706 --> 02:19:09.607
Do you think
it will be like this forever?

2379
02:19:09.607 --> 02:19:11.443
[laughing]

2380
02:19:11.443 --> 02:19:13.511
