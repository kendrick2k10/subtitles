3
00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:20.400
Are we friends now?

4
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.800
Hey. I haven't seen you in forever.
How are you?

5
00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.520
No. I'm good.

6
00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.759
My gosh. he said that?

7
00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:49.960
My god. that is so cute!

8
00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.280
My god. that is so cute!

9
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.039
My god. that is so cute!

10
00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.039
- Morning!
- Hi. Aunt Angela.

11
00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.919
- Here. let me get it. I got it.
- Thank you.

12
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.159
How do I look? I know it's only been
nine months. but I don't know.

13
00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.560
- I feel like I lost a step or two.
- You look great.

14
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.800
Ladies!
Breakfast is getting cold!

15
00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.960
I smell carbs.
Why does he always do this?

16
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.680
Because he's trying.
Because that's what we do. right?

17
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.000
We rise above
and we make it work.

18
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.639
- Mi amor. Princesa.
- Coming!

19
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.800
I mean. it was just
so much simpler before.

20
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.960
I know. It was.
But I'm proud of you.

21
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.560
I'm proud of us. I mean. look at us.
We're complete.

22
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.680
- We're like one big. happy family now.
- Minus the carbs.

23
00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.479
I like that one.

24
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.599
See you down there.

25
00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.520
No. that's so cute.

26
00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.400
- You want a coffee?
- Yes. please.

27
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.000
Hey. gorgeous.

28
00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.439
- I love you in these.
- Quit it.

29
00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:14.080
I can't.

30
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.240
Good morning!
Pancakes?

31
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.079
So. big day today?

32
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.079
- We're still about two weeks out.
- You nervous?

33
00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:29.639
Emma doesn't get nervous.
Not like her auntie.

34
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.839
She's got this.

35
00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:34.199
We actually finish learning
the dance routine today.

36
00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.639
It's short.
like. four eight counts.

37
00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.120
Then we have to make a speech.
we present to everybody.

38
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.519
then everyone votes.

39
00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:42.600
and the winner is Dance Team Captain
Junior year.

40
00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.920
Any competition?

41
00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.199
Steph. but...

42
00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.680
I mean. not really. you know?

43
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.519
I don't know. Digame.

44
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.000
I'm kinda awesome.

45
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.120
- En español?
- I take French.

46
00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:01.240
Je suis géniale.

47
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.040
Besides. it's not like
you're really Cuban.

48
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.519
Soy asombroso! I mean. sure.
I'm just a huge Cuba-file.

49
00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:10.879
but there could be some Cuban
blood in me somewhere.

50
00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.040
I'm going to get you fluent
by the end of the year.

51
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.680
Steph's mom runs Pediatrics.

52
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.839
Rachel and I have been friends
for years.

53
00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:21.120
Well.
may the best dancer win.

54
00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.000
Try them. They're gluten-free.
Zero-calorie.

55
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.959
High-protein.

56
00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.600
So good.

57
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.759
Yes!

58
00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:38.439
You are so funny. mijito!
You are so funny!

59
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.319
But you can't outsmart your papa!
No. you cannot.

60
00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.160
Two things
he loves these days.

61
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.399
Yummy Oats
and throwing his spoons.

62
00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.040
There you go.

63
00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:53.680
- Hey. you sure you're okay with this?
- Okay with it? Are you kidding me?

64
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.560
I'm lucky.

65
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.920
I mean. remote classes are shorter.
I get to work on my book.

66
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.319
fix up The Beast.

67
00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:04.279
- I hate The Beast.
- No. you love The Beast...

68
00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.959
And I get to perfect my cooking
and. best of all.

69
00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:09.519
I get to take care of our son.

70
00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.360
And you get to put up a fence
around the pool

71
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.120
before the baby starts walking.

72
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.199
And I get to put up a fence
around the pool

73
00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.839
before the baby starts walking.

74
00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.920
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

75
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.439
Hey. before I forget. have either
of you seen my camping knife?

76
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.519
You know. the black one
with the carved handle?

77
00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.879
- I'll keep an eye out.
- Gracias. princesa.

78
00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:32.639
Come here.

79
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.800
Enjoy. enjoy!
Eat your pancakes.

80
00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.079
Of course.

81
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.720
Emma. what's wrong with Cade?

82
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.079
If he threw his spoon. there's some
new ones in the dishwasher.

83
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.439
- What's this?
- Rob wanted to talk to you about that.

84
00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:23.399
He used to lecture there.
He said it's amazing.

85
00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.439
95% of their graduates go Ivy.

86
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.879
- Since I know you're looking at Yale...
- Is it a boarding school?

87
00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.399
No. no. Not like that.
It's only a couple hours away.

88
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.000
so you could come home
on the weekends.

89
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.600
Just a second!

90
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.959
- This was Rob's idea?
- He just wants what's best for you.

91
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.439
Anyways. it's just something
to think about.

92
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.040
- Good luck today. Have fun.
- Thanks. kiddo. I needed that.

93
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.079
- Steph. you look so cute.
- Really?

94
00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:04.439
I keep telling you. It's adorbs.
Right. Em?

95
00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:06.720
- Yeah. It really suits you.
- You don't think it's too short?

96
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.879
No! Are you kidding me?
You look amazing.

97
00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.519
- It looks great.
- Thank you.

98
00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:33.200
All right.
Second Law.

99
00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.600
Stephanie?

100
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.799
The rate of change of momentum
of a body over time

101
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.639
is directly proportional to...

102
00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:48.960
Who can help her out?
Emma! Give us the business!

103
00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.519
The rate of change of momentum
of a body over time

104
00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:54.000
is directly proportional
to the force applied.

105
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.919
and occurs
in the same direction.

106
00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:57.919
And there it is!

107
00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:59.720
And now. for all the marbles.

108
00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:03.039
What is Newton's...

109
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.679
- Sorry.
- Come on in. Don't be shy.

110
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.639
Physics is the place to be!

111
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.279
- Okay. everyone. this is Katherine...
- Kat.

112
00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:18.320
Just Kat.

113
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.919
Kat Sandberg.
She's a transfer from upstate.

114
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.879
I'm sure you'll all
make her feel welcome.

115
00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:26.279
There's a spot just over there.

116
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.279
All right.
Back to the Big Kahuna.

117
00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:32.879
Newton's Third Law of Motion?
Anyone?

118
00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:36.120
Dazzle me. Grossman.

119
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.480
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction.

120
00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:40.559
Page 44.

121
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.720
Hello!
They moved you next to me.

122
00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:58.279
I know.
Lucky me.

123
00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:01.960
Well. consider this
a housewarming then.

124
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.320
- Still your favorite. right?
- You remembered.

125
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.639
Hide them under the desk
so the residents don't steal them.

126
00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:09.720
My gosh!
Isn't he just everything?

127
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.799
- Look at that hair!
- I know.

128
00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.600
- How're you holding up?
- Fine.

129
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.919
I somehow have
12.000 unread emails.

130
00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:20.759
- How is that even possible?
- I know.

131
00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:23.159
Hey. listen. you got a second?
I want to run something by you.

132
00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:25.519
- Yeah. Of course.
- Dance Team Captain auditions.

133
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.159
You too. right?

134
00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:30.480
Emma has been counting down
the days. It is...

135
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.799
- Ridiculous.
- Yeah.

136
00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:35.200
Girls are already so insecure
and so competitive at this age.

137
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.279
You know how long Steph cried
after she got her hair cut this weekend?

138
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.120
So I was thinking... slumber party.
Pizza. goofy games.

139
00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:47.840
Good. clean fun to just lighten it up.
take the pressure off.

140
00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:49.360
Emma would love that.

141
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.799
Dr. Grossman
to Emergency Room 3.

142
00:10:51.799 --> 00:10:53.639
They know you're here.

143
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.159
Better get in there. doc.
It's just like riding a bike.

144
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.559
Okay...

145
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.840
Okay. let's take it from that last
section again. Emma. jump in.

146
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.559
And...

147
00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:08.480
five. six. seven. eight!

148
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.440
Stop. You're too stiff.

149
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.360
Floppy feet give me migraines.

150
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.440
And face!
Give me face!

151
00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:19.240
That was a hot mess.
Okay. one more time.

152
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.679
Steph. jump in for Emma.

153
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.519
Emma. we need
more practice from you.

154
00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:28.320
And... five. six. seven. eight!

155
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.440
Amy. watch your spacing.

156
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:36.320
And face!

157
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.480
Better. Okay. girls.
catch your breath.

158
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.159
Great job. Stephanie.

159
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.360
- Bye. guys.
- See ya.

160
00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.799
Emma. you coming?

161
00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:57.320
- I need a few minutes.
- Don't worry. you'll get it.

162
00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:20.399
Emma!

163
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.919
- What's up?
- Hey. Nathan.

164
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.799
Need a ride?

165
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.559
I'm right around the corner.

166
00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:33.120
Okay. Okay. cool.

167
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.720
Next time then?

168
00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:38.519
- Sure.
- Okay.

169
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.039
- Later.
- Bye.

170
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.639
All right. guys.
welcome back.

171
00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:55.399
I want to make sure you all have your
cameras on and no cat emoticons this time

172
00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:57.039
because last time. we...

173
00:12:57.879 --> 00:13:00.519
The mouth was moving. yeah.
So. make sure your cameras are on.

174
00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:04.559
Trevor. your camera is on.
I don't like to not see your face. okay?

175
00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:06.240
So here we go.

176
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.919
This is the question
that I pose to all of you.

177
00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:12.720
Which author. of all the novels
that we've studied.

178
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.600
best represents
the heart and soul of Cuba?

179
00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:18.559
Arenas?

180
00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:20.279
Infante? Carpentier?

181
00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:24.639
Some of you are even going to make
an argument for Padura

182
00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.519
that I would be happy to read.

183
00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:31.200
I just think that if you go back
and review chapter five Carpentier.

184
00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:33.480
you're going to find...

185
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.559
Cade! Robert!
My god.

186
00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:57.399
- Cade!
- What is the matter with you?

187
00:13:57.399 --> 00:13:59.720
- You were supposed to be watching him!
- I was watching him!

188
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.559
I don't know what happened!
The door was closed!

189
00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:05.240
No. it was not closed! Do you realize
what could have just happened?

190
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.039
Okay. let's just calm down.
Are you okay. buddy?

191
00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:09.080
No. no. no!
I'm not going to calm down!

192
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.000
This is why I wanted
a fence around the pool!

193
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.879
This is exactly
what I was afraid of!

194
00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:17.159
Look. kids come into my ER all the time
after falling into the family pool.

195
00:14:17.159 --> 00:14:20.639
and it is always. always too late to save
them! Do you understand?

196
00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:22.919
Look. I'm sorry. okay?
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:25.480
I'm sorry. buddy.
I'm so sorry. Let's just...

198
00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:29.080
I'm going to get a fence put up around
this pool. and let's all just breathe.

199
00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:32.159
- Just don't.
- Angela.

200
00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.840
This looks delicious.

201
00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.720
Thank you.

202
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.120
Hopefully. we can just have
a nice dinner

203
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.000
and forget about the mistake
that I made earlier.

204
00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:16.559
That's nice.

205
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.360
- What is this?
- I'm so sorry.

206
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.799
I don't know what happened.
This is really salty.

207
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.759
Emma. don't eat that.

208
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.639
Can I order Chinese?

209
00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:39.879
Sure.

210
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.600
- He so likes you.
- I'm so not interested.

211
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.559
But I so gave him
your phone number!

212
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.519
I feel bad.

213
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.200
Should we. like. invite her
to sit with us or whatever?

214
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.159
- You're too nice. Steph.
- I'll do it.

215
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.360
Hi! I'm Emma.

216
00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:34.120
I know.

217
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.000
Those are my friends.
Steph and Lola.

218
00:16:38.679 --> 00:16:40.039
We dance.

219
00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:42.799
I'm sorry.

220
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.720
If you want.
you can. like. sit with us.

221
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.360
No thanks.

222
00:16:50.559 --> 00:16:51.960
Seriously?

223
00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:55.480
You don't recognize me. do you?

224
00:16:56.639 --> 00:16:57.919
Should I?

225
00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.799
Bye. Emma.

226
00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:04.640
Well. the offer still stands
if you get bored or whatever.

227
00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:07.119
Only stupid people get bored.

228
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.480
- Well?
- She said "maybe later."

229
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.640
Hey. Emma. Can you come in here
for a minute?

230
00:17:55.279 --> 00:17:56.720
Yeah.
What's up?

231
00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.799
Robert and I
have some amazing news.

232
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.440
Did you want to tell her
or do you want me to tell her?

233
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.000
No. you tell her.
you tell her.

234
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.599
Robert called in a few favors.
got you accepted to St. Crispin's

235
00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:09.559
for your Junior and Senior year!

236
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.880
I'm doing so well here. though.

237
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.200
Well. then you'll probably
do really good there.

238
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.400
Isn't that great?

239
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.200
Yeah.
This is incredible.

240
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.119
- Thank you. Robert.
- You're welcome.

241
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.880
And. hey. I found my knife.

242
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.920
Well. good news all around.

243
00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:35.880
We should celebrate. How about
tomorrow I make some steak?

244
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.759
- Yes. please! That would be awesome.
- Sounds great. Can't wait.

245
00:20:09.319 --> 00:20:10.920
Yeah. I can meet you at noon.

246
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.759
No. that's the earliest I can be there.
I have two appointments at ten.

247
00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:16.599
I know. Yeah. Okay.

248
00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:18.759
Just let me know
exactly where...

249
00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:02.279
- What do you want?
- I think you know.

250
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.240
Do you know what happens
in the electric chair?

251
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.279
Emma!

252
00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:08.519
It cooks you.

253
00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:10.880
Your skin crackles and shrivels
like homemade bacon in the morning.

254
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.319
It's okay. Daddy.
I'd never hurt anyone for no reason.

255
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.039
...a basket of kisses.

256
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.519
A basket of kisses...

257
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.839
- Em? Emma. what's wrong?
- Nothing. Just tired.

258
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.920
- S'up? Can I join you guys?
- Yeah. absolutely.

259
00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:45.559
- So. how do you like it here so far?
- I don't like it anywhere.

260
00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.440
- You can't smoke in here.
- No?

261
00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:57.839
- So where'd you transfer from?
- St. Alden's.

262
00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.920
My God! So you two. like.
know each other?

263
00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:03.279
Ish.
I went by Katie back then.

264
00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.759
You should've said something.

265
00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:09.440
You think you're smart.
You would've figured it out eventually.

266
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.839
- Or not.
- So wait.

267
00:22:11.359 --> 00:22:13.039
You knew that kid who drowned?

268
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.279
- And that teacher?
- Yeah.

269
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.519
Sorry about your dad.

270
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.519
It's fine.

271
00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:31.119
- I think...
- You should ask her.

272
00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:34.119
I'm having a slumber party
at my place tomorrow.

273
00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:36.480
It's more of a dance team thing.
but you should totally come.

274
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.039
Maybe.

275
00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:42.720
See ya around. Emma.

276
00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:55.400
That sounds good.

277
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.759
And... this is for you.

278
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.559
Thank you.

279
00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:04.119
De nada.

280
00:23:05.839 --> 00:23:07.640
- You know what...
- That sounds like a poopy cry.

281
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.839
- Let me go!
- No. I got it. Let me just...

282
00:23:09.839 --> 00:23:11.599
- Are you sure?
- ...do this.

283
00:23:13.079 --> 00:23:14.839
- Can you watch this?
- I will watch this.

284
00:23:14.839 --> 00:23:16.839
- I'll be right back.
- I'll do my best.

285
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:26.720
- Is that your phone?
- Darn it. It's in the office.

286
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.519
Okay... you watch these.
I'll be two minutes.

287
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.480
Okay.

288
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.119
Hello?

289
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.359
Hey. yes. We're definitely
still on for ten.

290
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.599
Okay. all clean.

291
00:23:54.319 --> 00:23:55.920
All clean.
Good boy.

292
00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:58.359
Robert?

293
00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:01.799
Come on!

294
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.960
Robert!

295
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.079
The fire extinguisher...
it's under the sink!

296
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.839
Emma. no. don't.

297
00:24:18.279 --> 00:24:19.920
I thought you were supposed
to be watching it.

298
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.440
I was watching it. I don't know what
happened. I left it with Emma.

299
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.599
I had to go to the bathroom.
I was gone for two seconds.

300
00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:27.240
- It's not my fault!
- Well. then whose fault is it?

301
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.440
Okay. quiet. please.
both of you.

302
00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:32.799
- Should we do takeout again?
- Takeout's fine.

303
00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:45.319
You know. it costs the same
whether you talk or not.

304
00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:47.480
I'm aware.

305
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.480
What is running through
that brain of yours?

306
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.680
What if the laws of physics
applied to people as well?

307
00:24:54.279 --> 00:24:56.799
Action.
Equal and opposite reaction?

308
00:24:58.039 --> 00:25:01.440
I don't think
that's what Newton meant.

309
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.880
My aunt wants to send me
to a boarding school.

310
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.480
I'm aware. And just for the record.
I've heard that school is outstanding.

311
00:25:10.519 --> 00:25:13.119
- Its alumni end up at...
- Ivy Leagues all across the country.

312
00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:16.039
I'm aware.
I've read the brochure. Twice.

313
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.640
Most girls in your shoes
would be thrilled.

314
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.079
- Robert wants me out of the house.
- And why would he want that?

315
00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:29.559
Did you behave in such a way that might
have precipitated his decision?

316
00:25:30.039 --> 00:25:32.640
Did your action
cause a reaction?

317
00:25:34.319 --> 00:25:38.039
- Maybe.
- So you created a problem.

318
00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:43.359
And what is the proper response
to a problem of our own making?

319
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.400
Solving it.

320
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.519
And you are good
at solving problems. aren't you?

321
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.079
Yes. I'm very good
at solving problems.

322
00:25:57.359 --> 00:26:00.079
Thank you. Dr. March.
This has been incredibly helpful.

323
00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:02.599
I am so glad to have been able
to help you. Emma.

324
00:26:03.759 --> 00:26:05.759
All right. Bye.

325
00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.880
Robert.
I wanted to apologize...

326
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Uncle Robert.
I just wanted to apologize...

327
00:26:35.079 --> 00:26:36.319
Hi.

328
00:26:37.319 --> 00:26:39.079
- Hey.
- I thought you might be thirsty.

329
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.200
Can we talk?

330
00:26:44.599 --> 00:26:47.960
Uncle Robert.
I just wanted to apologize

331
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.880
for forgetting
to give you back your knife.

332
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.039
I found it next
to all the pool equipment

333
00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:56.039
and it just slipped my mind
to give it back to you. so...

334
00:26:57.119 --> 00:26:58.319
I'm sorry.

335
00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:00.759
Thank you.

336
00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.079
You know.
change is hard for everyone.

337
00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.279
For me.
after my dad. you know.

338
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.240
it's just... I guess. sometimes.
something gets in my head and...

339
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.279
maybe I'll do something
I shouldn't have.

340
00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.200
I understand.

341
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.720
Maybe this is good for us?
Maybe we could start over.

342
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.200
Yeah.

343
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.880
And who knows. maybe St. Crispin's
will be good for me.

344
00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:32.839
- Really?
- Yeah. 90% of their grads go Ivy.

345
00:27:33.599 --> 00:27:36.160
I want to go Ivy. so I'd say
those are pretty good odds.

346
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.119
Yeah.

347
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.640
Besides. you're doing what's best
for your family and for me. so.

348
00:27:44.119 --> 00:27:45.279
Thank you.

349
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.400
You're welcome.

350
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.759
Come here.

351
00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.599
Emma. do you want
a ride to the party?

352
00:27:57.599 --> 00:28:00.519
No. Steph's is right around the corner.
I'm going to walk.

353
00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:04.640
Okay. Well. have fun! Just let me know
if you need anything. Anything at all.

354
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.240
- I will.
- And...

355
00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.319
Robert told me
you two are good.

356
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.680
You have no idea how happy
that makes me. honey bear.

357
00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:40.759
Emma?

358
00:28:42.319 --> 00:28:43.559
Angela?

359
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.279
Come in!

360
00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:33.680
- Hi!
- Hi.

361
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.000
Come on.
Go have a seat.

362
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.599
- Isn't that hilarious?
- That's so hilarious.

363
00:29:42.519 --> 00:29:43.839
What did you guys get?

364
00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.920
- I think so.
- That's what I said.

365
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.839
Who's that?

366
00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:52.440
- It's Kat.
- Right.

367
00:29:52.839 --> 00:29:55.319
I still don't see
why you guys had to invite her.

368
00:29:55.319 --> 00:29:57.839
Because she's your friend.
I was trying to be nice.

369
00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:03.799
It is so nice to have some of the girls
on the team here.

370
00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:06.960
Now. you girls have fun.
And remember.

371
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.759
the only person you're ever
really competing with is yourself.

372
00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:14.799
- Thanks. Mom.
- That's really helpful.

373
00:30:19.759 --> 00:30:22.599
So how cool is it that you and Emma
used to know each other?

374
00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:24.799
We weren't
really friends. though.

375
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.839
We weren't?

376
00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.599
I mean. let's face it. You weren't
really friends with anyone.

377
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.680
- I'm sure that's not true.
- It so is.

378
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.480
Remember that time I tripped
and you stole my watch?

379
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.559
- I don't think that was me.
- It was.

380
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.400
But whatever.
It's cool.

381
00:30:50.759 --> 00:30:52.559
Anyone wanna play a game?

382
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.400
Yes.

383
00:31:01.119 --> 00:31:02.240
Robert?

384
00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:08.759
Robert?

385
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.599
Okay. Do I get to go first
since it's my house?

386
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.680
Never have I ever
cheated on a test.

387
00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:36.200
My god.
My god.

388
00:31:40.599 --> 00:31:42.920
Love that we are goin'
old school on the gas.

389
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.799
Okay...

390
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.039
Never have I ever made out
in the front seat of a car.

391
00:31:51.599 --> 00:31:53.119
B.S.

392
00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:55.160
I didn't say anything
about the back.

393
00:31:59.079 --> 00:32:01.960
My god. Saint Emma.
You've never done anything.

394
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.720
I'm even on meds
and I'm smoking.

395
00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.279
- Who's next?
- I'll go.

396
00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:09.640
Make it good.

397
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.160
Never have I ever...
killed anyone.

398
00:32:26.119 --> 00:32:28.480
Who did you...
Who did you kill?

399
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.960
- My mom. When I born.
- Thank God.

400
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.119
- You know what I mean.
- What'd you think I meant?

401
00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:42.039
Did you think I actually killed someone?
I'm not a psycho.

402
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.039
- What the...
- Mom!

403
00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:49.799
Emma. honey. grab your things.
I'm taking you to the hospital.

404
00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:53.079
- Why?
- There's been an accident. Come on.

405
00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.839
We will talk about this later.

406
00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:13.519
- Aunt Angela?
- Emma. Come here.

407
00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:21.079
- What happened?
- He was pinned...

408
00:33:22.079 --> 00:33:24.720
That car.
I've always hated that car. and the...

409
00:33:25.799 --> 00:33:27.599
the jack malfunctioned somehow.

410
00:33:27.599 --> 00:33:30.480
and he was pinned under it
for god knows how long.

411
00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:34.319
But he's strong.
He's always been strong.

412
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.599
And so now
we just have to wait and see.

413
00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:08.559
Are we friends now?

414
00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:19.480
You're silly.

415
00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.320
I know you don't want
to eat right now.

416
00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.679
It's important
to keep your strength up.

417
00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.679
That's what Robert
would want you to do.

418
00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:34.039
- Cade?
- He's fine.

419
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.480
Just put him down for his nap.

420
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.079
Little guy doesn't even know
anything's wrong.

421
00:34:39.559 --> 00:34:41.639
Groceries are coming
in an hour.

422
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.719
What would I do without you.
honey bear?

423
00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:48.639
Is he going to be okay?

424
00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:51.960
I don't know.

425
00:34:53.519 --> 00:34:56.000
We're going to make it
through this. all right?

426
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.559
Because we're Grossmans.
That's what we do.

427
00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.519
- We rise above and we make it work.
- That's right.

428
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.920
Yeah.

429
00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.039
- Hello? This is Emma.
- Hey. Emma. It's Nathan.

430
00:35:47.719 --> 00:35:48.960
Hi.

431
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.360
Steph told me about your uncle
and I just...

432
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.719
I just wanted to check in.
see how you were holding up.

433
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.880
- Yeah. I'm... I'm fine.
- Okay. Cool. cool.

434
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.320
I was just checking.

435
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.199
Okay.

436
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.760
- Bye.
- Bye.

437
00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.800
Are you kidding?

438
00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:44.679
Robert. Robert!

439
00:36:44.679 --> 00:36:47.639
No. No. you've got to leave
that in for now. It's okay.

440
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.679
Nod if you can hear me.

441
00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.800
That's good.
Do you know where you are?

442
00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.480
You're in a hospital. There was
an accident and you got hurt.

443
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.519
We just have to get you
extubated and get you home.

444
00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.000
and with physio therapy. you're going
to be up and walking in a few months.

445
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.599
It's okay. it's okay.
Please. don't... don't move.

446
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.599
Robert. do you remember
what happened?

447
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.800
You want to write something?

448
00:37:26.559 --> 00:37:27.960
Okay. Yeah.

449
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.360
Here.

450
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.480
Here.

451
00:37:37.719 --> 00:37:39.000
There you go.
There you go.

452
00:37:56.679 --> 00:38:00.119
I've been dancing with you girls for
the past couple of years now. I just...

453
00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:03.199
I don't know.
we've had so much fun together.

454
00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:05.519
We've had so much fun together.

455
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.239
- We've... we've had...
- Emma? Can you come downstairs?

456
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.199
Coming!

457
00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:15.960
- You're home early.
- I have incredible news.

458
00:38:17.079 --> 00:38:19.000
- What?
- Robert's going to pull through.

459
00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.199
- I knew he'd make it through.
- Yeah.

460
00:38:23.199 --> 00:38:25.320
I don't want to keep him in there
a minute longer than he has to be.

461
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.440
so we're going to set him up down here.
I'm bringing in a nurse.

462
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.480
physical therapist.

463
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.519
He's going to be up and walking
before we know it.

464
00:38:34.239 --> 00:38:36.039
Has he said anything?

465
00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:38.119
He's had flashes.

466
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.440
What kind of flashes?

467
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.079
Nothing specific.
That's it.

468
00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:44.559
I remember
everything that happened to me.

469
00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:47.199
- Yeah. but you're special. Emma.
- I know.

470
00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:51.440
And you're the first person
he asked about when he came to.

471
00:38:54.039 --> 00:38:57.920
- What did he say?
- He asked if you were all right.

472
00:38:58.559 --> 00:39:00.079
He loves you. honeybear.

473
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.480
I need to go and practice.
Election's tomorrow.

474
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.239
Have fun.

475
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.440
What's going on?

476
00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:49.079
- You haven't heard?
- No.

477
00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:51.440
Things have been
kinda busy at my place.

478
00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.280
- Where's Steph?
- Not coming.

479
00:39:54.599 --> 00:39:55.559
Why?

480
00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:58.480
Somebody totally stole her dog
out of her backyard last night.

481
00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.719
and this morning.
some jogger found it.

482
00:40:00.719 --> 00:40:03.360
- And?
- It was dead. Emma!

483
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.760
Like. chopped up and stabbed.
and blood and guts everywhere!

484
00:40:07.719 --> 00:40:09.760
That is so horror movie.

485
00:40:10.719 --> 00:40:13.000
- Do they know who did it?
- Some psychopath.

486
00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.480
The world is full of them.
That's why there's so many podcasts.

487
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.239
Hey.

488
00:40:21.679 --> 00:40:23.000
Hey. Nathan.

489
00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:26.199
- What's up?
- Not much.

490
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.760
- Can I walk you to class?
- Sure.

491
00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:38.239
Okay. ladies.
Settle in.

492
00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:44.079
We have a bit of a dilemma
before us at the moment.

493
00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:45.239
Stephanie Lowford.

494
00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:48.480
She's not here to audition. obviously.
and for good reason.

495
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.199
So. the question becomes is she still
eligible for Captain next year?

496
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.280
I say yes. I mean. it's not her fault
someone went all stabby-stab on her pup.

497
00:40:59.719 --> 00:41:01.880
She really wants this
and she's been working super hard.

498
00:41:03.079 --> 00:41:04.320
Any opposed?

499
00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.039
Emma.

500
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.599
I just wanted to say
that I agree with Lola.

501
00:41:17.239 --> 00:41:18.760
I think that we all do.

502
00:41:20.119 --> 00:41:21.400
Girls?

503
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.400
Okay. Then let's get to it.

504
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.639
Anyone still interested in running
for Captain. come up here

505
00:41:26.639 --> 00:41:29.800
and tell us why you think
you'd be the best to lead the team.

506
00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.039
Then afterwards. we're going
to vote by secret ballot.

507
00:41:32.039 --> 00:41:34.360
and. yes. you can still vote
for Stephanie.

508
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.159
So. who's first?

509
00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:39.440
The floor is yours.

510
00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.280
I've been dancing with you girls
for the past couple years now.

511
00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.920
and I just feel like
we have so much fun together.

512
00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.840
I just really want to make sure that
we make good memories together.

513
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.719
because I want to be able
to look back on them

514
00:41:55.719 --> 00:41:58.599
when we're all old and gray.
I guess. and be able to say...

515
00:41:59.199 --> 00:42:02.159
"Damn. dance team
was really sick."

516
00:42:03.159 --> 00:42:04.800
And I just...

517
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.280
You know...

518
00:42:10.119 --> 00:42:11.840
Like I said. I just really want

519
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.480
to keep on making
great memories with you guys.

520
00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.039
I love you all. and...

521
00:42:17.039 --> 00:42:19.199
I don't know.
I guess that's my "speech".

522
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.119
Please vote for me
as dance captain.

523
00:42:22.119 --> 00:42:24.360
If you don't.
no hard feelings. I guess.

524
00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:26.519
and. yeah. go. Wasps!

525
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.800
Okay. who's up next?

526
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.079
Hey.

527
00:42:40.519 --> 00:42:43.280
Good news. Robert gets to come
home in one week.

528
00:42:44.239 --> 00:42:46.480
I just have to sort out
this room for him.

529
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.840
- Because of his wheelchair.
- That's great.

530
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.920
And you have an interview
with St. Crispin's this weekend.

531
00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.679
They just want
to touch base with you

532
00:42:54.679 --> 00:42:57.280
and see how you're feeling
about enrollment. okay?

533
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.760
I can't wait.

534
00:43:00.239 --> 00:43:01.480
How did it go?

535
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.639
Steph won.
I am so happy for her.

536
00:43:06.679 --> 00:43:10.360
- Emma. do you want to talk about it?
- No. No. I don't. Sorry. Excuse me.

537
00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.800
Emma.

538
00:43:52.239 --> 00:43:53.639
Right here.

539
00:43:53.639 --> 00:43:56.519
Don't you worry.
I've got many years' experience.

540
00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.760
Welcome home.

541
00:44:08.239 --> 00:44:10.679
That's good here. Excellent.

542
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.880
Since there is a teen
in the household.

543
00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.960
the medicine cabinet
must remain locked at all times.

544
00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.320
Take one key and keep it on your person.
always. and I'll have mine as well.

545
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.519
Okay.

546
00:44:23.039 --> 00:44:24.960
Emma. Hey.

547
00:44:25.679 --> 00:44:27.480
Come in. princesa.
Don't be shy.

548
00:44:28.119 --> 00:44:30.239
My niece. Emma.
Emma. this is Cora.

549
00:44:30.239 --> 00:44:32.719
She's going to be with us during
the day to help out with Robert.

550
00:44:32.719 --> 00:44:33.960
- Hi.
- Hi.

551
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.079
If you ever need anything.
just let me know.

552
00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:38.519
I'm thinking about
going into medicine like my aunt.

553
00:44:38.519 --> 00:44:40.760
Excellent.
You should be so proud.

554
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.599
Hi.

555
00:44:46.599 --> 00:44:48.960
It's nice to have you
back inside the house.

556
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.199
It's so good to be home.

557
00:44:51.559 --> 00:44:52.960
How do you feel?

558
00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.679
Very. very bad.

559
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.039
Pain meds in 20 minutes.

560
00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:00.639
I'm in so much pain right now.

561
00:45:00.639 --> 00:45:03.320
Yeah. the point is to get you weened off.
not get you hooked.

562
00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.679
Right. Can you tell that
to my hips and my legs?

563
00:45:05.679 --> 00:45:07.559
- Robert...
- I'm fine.

564
00:45:13.519 --> 00:45:15.599
Do you remember what happened?

565
00:45:16.239 --> 00:45:17.400
No.

566
00:45:18.079 --> 00:45:19.360
Nada. Just...

567
00:45:21.079 --> 00:45:22.280
black.

568
00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.400
- Restroom?
- Yeah. Let me show you.

569
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.639
Are you thirsty?

570
00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:39.159
Here.

571
00:45:42.679 --> 00:45:43.800
What?

572
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.559
Nothing.

573
00:45:48.639 --> 00:45:49.960
I brought you this.

574
00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.639
That way. you can always feel
close to him.

575
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.039
That's very thoughtful. Emma.
Thank you.

576
00:46:02.559 --> 00:46:05.039
I'm trying to stick at it.
like. as long as I can.

577
00:46:07.199 --> 00:46:09.559
- Think you could give us a second?
- Yeah. sure. Absolutely.

578
00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:11.760
- I'll just meet you in class.
- Okay. Bye.

579
00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.320
- What? What do you want?
- So that's what now? Six?

580
00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.679
- Six what?
- Six unfortunate coincidences.

581
00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.840
But the last one didn't really work out
the way you wanted it to. did it?

582
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.920
Steph still beat you.
I know all about you.

583
00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:31.440
- Do tell.
- Where should I start?

584
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.239
With the housekeeper falling down
the stairs? Milo drowning?

585
00:46:34.239 --> 00:46:36.800
Mrs. Ellis' car wreck?
A babysitter burning to death?

586
00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:41.039
A dad getting shot.
A stepuncle getting crushed by a car.

587
00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.440
And now a dog
getting chopped up in a park?

588
00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.159
- Coincidences? Or a pattern?
- Stray Kat has claws.

589
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.280
You've been busy.

590
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.679
If I've really been that busy.
you might want to be careful.

591
00:46:52.679 --> 00:46:54.119
Or what?

592
00:46:54.119 --> 00:46:55.719
- I'll tell everyone.
- Tell them what?

593
00:46:55.719 --> 00:46:57.079
The truth!

594
00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.280
Emma?

595
00:46:59.639 --> 00:47:01.519
- Are you coming?
- I'll be there in a second.

596
00:47:05.639 --> 00:47:07.760
Accidents happen
all the time to people.

597
00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.760
Especially people like you.

598
00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.639
People like me?

599
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.639
People who hurt themselves.

600
00:47:19.639 --> 00:47:23.920
I may have hurt myself.
but it's really you I feel sorry for.

601
00:47:25.039 --> 00:47:27.239
Well. you shouldn't worry
about me. silly.

602
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.519
I feel bad for you.

603
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.239
You'll always be alone.

604
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.519
Maybe.

605
00:47:38.519 --> 00:47:40.320
But at least
I won't be you. Kitty Kat.

606
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.039
Are you serious?

607
00:47:46.039 --> 00:47:48.679
You can't just slap people. What the
hell's wrong with you? You okay?

608
00:47:48.679 --> 00:47:50.440
She's insane!

609
00:47:51.159 --> 00:47:52.639
- What's going on here!
- She slapped her.

610
00:47:52.639 --> 00:47:54.239
- She slapped me!
- Nothing.

611
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.039
Kat. That's detention.

612
00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.199
Piss off!

613
00:47:59.199 --> 00:48:00.960
- For a week!
- Whatever!

614
00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.199
What the hell?

615
00:48:02.199 --> 00:48:04.440
Nathan. please take her
to the nurse's office.

616
00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.960
Of course. Come on.

617
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.280
Why don't you just relax
for the rest of the period?

618
00:48:10.159 --> 00:48:12.079
Let me know
if you need anything.

619
00:49:01.519 --> 00:49:03.760
- Hey. What is it. honeybear?
- Nothing.

620
00:49:04.719 --> 00:49:06.360
Emma. come on.

621
00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:10.159
It's me.

622
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:15.400
All right. I get it. it's been
a rough couple of weeks. but...

623
00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.960
I mean. how's school?

624
00:49:19.679 --> 00:49:21.519
- It's okay.
- Okay?

625
00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.960
There's this girl.
Her name is Kat.

626
00:49:27.559 --> 00:49:29.280
She transferred
from St. Alden's.

627
00:49:34.039 --> 00:49:36.519
Did you know her?
Was she in the same grade as you?

628
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.760
Not really.

629
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.199
She's just been saying some really
awful things to me lately.

630
00:49:46.519 --> 00:49:47.679
About?

631
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.239
About Milo.

632
00:49:51.639 --> 00:49:53.480
Mrs. Ellis.
My dad.

633
00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.039
You know. she thinks
I had something to do with it.

634
00:49:59.039 --> 00:50:00.960
everything that happened to us.

635
00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.400
I wasn't going to say anything.
but she hit me today.

636
00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:08.199
What?

637
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.239
Yeah. and just with everything
that's been going on lately.

638
00:50:12.239 --> 00:50:13.719
I mean. it's just awful.

639
00:50:13.719 --> 00:50:17.840
I promise you. I am going to squash
this real quick. Okay?

640
00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.639
I'm going to make a phone call
first thing in the morning.

641
00:50:20.639 --> 00:50:22.400
Come here.
It's okay.

642
00:50:24.159 --> 00:50:26.119
This is just
a rough patch. kiddo.

643
00:50:28.239 --> 00:50:30.880
We are going to get through this.
I promise.

644
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.000
Hey. it's okay.

645
00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.679
So is there... any good news?

646
00:50:38.519 --> 00:50:41.599
- I mean. there's this boy...
- Really?

647
00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.559
He's cute.

648
00:50:49.159 --> 00:50:50.719
Sorry.

649
00:51:01.079 --> 00:51:03.639
No. I don't want to hear
that you'll look into it.

650
00:51:03.639 --> 00:51:05.800
I want it taken
care of immediately.

651
00:51:06.239 --> 00:51:10.000
Yes. And if you don't plan
on calling Kat's parents. then I will.

652
00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.480
Okay. All right then.
Thank you.

653
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.119
- More good news. I take it?
- I wish.

654
00:51:19.559 --> 00:51:20.880
How's Steph?

655
00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.760
She a bit better.
now that the shock has worn off.

656
00:51:24.119 --> 00:51:26.719
Harold promised to buy her
a new dog this summer.

657
00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:29.119
They still haven't
figured out who did this?

658
00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:32.119
No. No. A jogger saw someone
walking the dog.

659
00:51:32.119 --> 00:51:35.599
We got a little on our security cam.
but nothing determinate.

660
00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:38.000
Who does something like that?

661
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.519
Who would kill
an innocent animal?

662
00:51:41.519 --> 00:51:43.000
Harold thinks I'm crazy.

663
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.159
but I could have sworn that it was
young woman in that footage.

664
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.199
- I'll send it to you.
- Yeah.

665
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:54.719
But... tell Emma congratulations
on back-up Dance Team Captain.

666
00:51:55.079 --> 00:51:57.280
Steph said she was
very sweet about it.

667
00:51:57.599 --> 00:51:58.840
I will let her know.

668
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.880
Steph!

669
00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.400
Someone get the nurse!
My god!

670
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.719
Call 911!
She needs her meds.

671
00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.559
- Stephanie!
- My god!

672
00:52:43.639 --> 00:52:46.000
- This is very disappointing.
- What is?

673
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.400
Your continued harassment
of Emma Grossman.

674
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.880
We don't condone violence
at the school.

675
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.960
Okay. listen.
it was not my fault.

676
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.039
- I was just...
- Stephanie Lowford's had a seizure.

677
00:52:55.039 --> 00:52:58.159
Her midazolam is missing. I've called 911
and they're on their way.

678
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.719
Emma...

679
00:53:09.199 --> 00:53:10.400
My god.

680
00:53:12.159 --> 00:53:14.320
- Rachel. I...
- Something happened at the school!

681
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.239
What have you done?

682
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:56.280
Nothing.

683
00:53:57.719 --> 00:54:01.559
- You wouldn't lie to me. would you?
- No. I would never.

684
00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.800
I'm not mad. Emma. I'm not.
I just need to know the truth.

685
00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.079
- About?
- Everything.

686
00:54:11.159 --> 00:54:13.119
Did you do something
to your friend. Stephanie?

687
00:54:13.119 --> 00:54:16.039
She had a seizure.
How could that have been my fault?

688
00:54:17.519 --> 00:54:19.599
- Her dog?
- That wasn't me.

689
00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.599
Emma. I saw you.
I saw you on the ring-door cam.

690
00:54:23.599 --> 00:54:26.079
- No. you didn't!
- I did. Emma. This is your sweater.

691
00:54:26.719 --> 00:54:30.800
- No. Stop lying to me!
- Tell me the truth!

692
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.840
- Emma. tell me!
- Okay. I'm sorry!

693
00:54:33.599 --> 00:54:36.199
All right?
I let her dog out. okay?

694
00:54:36.199 --> 00:54:39.719
I wanted to be Dance Captain so bad.
and Stephanie. she just...

695
00:54:39.719 --> 00:54:41.440
she makes me so angry.

696
00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.800
So I just... I thought...

697
00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.159
I wanted to hurt her
and I let her dog out.

698
00:54:45.159 --> 00:54:48.039
I thought it was going to come back.
I thought they would find it. I'm sorry!

699
00:54:48.039 --> 00:54:50.599
I promise! I promise I didn't hurt it!
I swear!

700
00:54:50.599 --> 00:54:53.079
Okay. okay.
Okay. It's okay.

701
00:54:54.719 --> 00:54:56.119
God. It's okay.

702
00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.559
What would you give me for
a basket of hugs. Aunt Angela?

703
00:55:57.159 --> 00:55:58.360
There.

704
00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.639
Now. see?
This isn't so bad.

705
00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.039
A little cold.

706
00:56:04.719 --> 00:56:06.599
It's 57 degrees.

707
00:56:07.639 --> 00:56:09.679
Fresh air
builds the immune system.

708
00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.920
You know. in Russia.
they used to bundle up children

709
00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.280
and have them take a nap in the snow
in the winter. True story.

710
00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:20.320
Do you want to know what Cubans
think of the Russians?

711
00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.960
What the hell?

712
00:56:34.199 --> 00:56:35.320
What?

713
00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.039
Great.

714
00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.679
- I need a favor.
- Of course.

715
00:57:03.159 --> 00:57:05.440
Can you bring him back inside
in a little while?

716
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.159
I have a minor disaster
to deal with.

717
00:57:07.159 --> 00:57:09.079
- Don't worry. I got it.
- Okay.

718
00:57:09.079 --> 00:57:11.400
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. it's good. I've got it handled.

719
00:57:13.239 --> 00:57:14.440
Hey.

720
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.400
Yeah. hi. Nathan.
It's Emma.

721
00:57:19.239 --> 00:57:20.519
What are you doing?

722
00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:52.960
No. I'm not doing anything.

723
00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:58.159
Yeah. I'm good.
It's quite chilly out.

724
00:57:58.159 --> 00:57:59.840
Emma?

725
00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.239
I want to get inside
and warm up. take my meds.

726
00:58:02.239 --> 00:58:04.280
- Can you help me in there?
- Whatever.

727
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.199
Emma!

728
00:58:09.199 --> 00:58:11.000
Yeah. no. it's nothing.

729
00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.039
Emma!

730
00:58:17.159 --> 00:58:18.559
No. no. no.

731
00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.400
That's the stupidest joke
I've ever heard.

732
00:58:31.239 --> 00:58:32.519
- Yeah.
- God.

733
00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.239
Yeah...

734
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.679
Robert?
What in God's name?

735
00:58:53.159 --> 00:58:55.360
- Robert. what are you doing?
- What is happening here?

736
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:58.519
- You're ignoring me. I'm trying to...
- I was finishing a call. I'm sorry.

737
00:58:58.519 --> 00:59:00.440
I can do it myself.
See?

738
00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:04.159
She was coming back to get you.

739
00:59:04.159 --> 00:59:06.480
You couldn't have waited
a few more minutes?

740
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.760
- Just get me inside.
- All right.

741
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.360
So... what's his name?

742
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.599
Nathan.

743
00:59:17.119 --> 00:59:18.320
Nathan...

744
00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.800
Well. I hope he's not
as stubborn as this one.

745
00:59:41.159 --> 00:59:44.360
Sorry. It's leftovers.
Angela's been at the hospital all day.

746
00:59:46.199 --> 00:59:47.760
I already fed Cade.

747
00:59:48.719 --> 00:59:50.880
I hope you're not mad
about earlier.

748
00:59:51.519 --> 00:59:53.039
You fool so many.

749
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.719
But not me.

750
00:59:58.079 --> 00:59:59.480
Not anymore.

751
01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.679
What are you talking about?

752
01:00:02.679 --> 01:00:05.199
I remember everything.
I know it was you.

753
01:00:07.559 --> 01:00:11.199
- What are you gonna do about it?
- This is what I'm going to do.

754
01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.440
I love my wife.
and she loves you.

755
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.119
so hurting you hurts her.
and I don't want that.

756
01:00:20.159 --> 01:00:22.440
Not after what happened
to her brother.

757
01:00:23.039 --> 01:00:25.920
So. I am going to get better...

758
01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.920
...and I'm not going
to say anything.

759
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.360
In exchange for what?

760
01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.920
You will go to boarding school
and leave the baby and us alone.

761
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.320
What if I don't want to do
either of those things?

762
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.119
Well. then I'm going
to tell the truth.

763
01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.480
And Angela will be hurt.
but you will be hurt way more.

764
01:00:53.559 --> 01:00:54.880
No Ivy League.

765
01:00:55.559 --> 01:00:57.760
No happy life.
No nothing.

766
01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.320
You will be locked away forever.
Completely alone.

767
01:01:04.679 --> 01:01:06.000
Comprende?

768
01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.360
Tio. entiendo claramente.

769
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.360
Que bueno que tuvimos
esta conversación.

770
01:01:15.079 --> 01:01:17.239
Te tengo en la mira. mijita.

771
01:02:48.039 --> 01:02:49.880
- Hey.
- Hey.

772
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.880
- Who's that for?
- It's for you. To keep you company.

773
01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.440
- Keep an eye on you.
- Where are you going?

774
01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.599
I'm going to visit
an old family friend.

775
01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:01.519
Should be back
in a couple of hours. okay?

776
01:03:01.519 --> 01:03:04.079
- Okay. What about Cade?
- I'm taking him with me.

777
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.920
- Don't worry. I'll be back soon.
- That's fine. You go.

778
01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.480
- Enjoy yourself.
- Okay.

779
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.920
- How's that hip?
- It's still there.

780
01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:14.719
- It'll heal.
- Okay.

781
01:03:18.519 --> 01:03:20.440
- I love you.
- I love you. too.

782
01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.719
You ready to go for a car ride?

783
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.920
Okay. you're going
to sleep the whole way. right?

784
01:03:35.519 --> 01:03:37.480
There we go.
Good boy.

785
01:03:38.159 --> 01:03:39.719
Okay. let's go.

786
01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.079
Brian. Hi.

787
01:04:19.719 --> 01:04:21.000
Thank you.

788
01:04:24.159 --> 01:04:26.199
- How was the drive?
- Not bad.

789
01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.360
I haven't been
out this way since...

790
01:04:30.519 --> 01:04:31.920
Well. you know.

791
01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.719
I'm glad you reached out.

792
01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.199
I've been... wanting to reach out
to you. too. it's just...

793
01:04:41.039 --> 01:04:43.239
I haven't been able to work up
the nerve to call you.

794
01:04:45.079 --> 01:04:46.280
It's...

795
01:04:47.199 --> 01:04:49.920
It's been eating at me...
what happened.

796
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.559
what I had to do.

797
01:04:52.559 --> 01:04:55.519
Stop right there. David!
I will not let you hurt that girl.

798
01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.840
I want to move on. too.
You ask away.

799
01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.840
- Anything you need to know.
- My brother.

800
01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:05.199
When he first arrived.
with Emma...

801
01:05:07.159 --> 01:05:08.400
what did he say?

802
01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.159
I mean. how did he act?
Did he...

803
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:16.840
- Did he seem crazy?
- He seemed steady. Not crazy.

804
01:05:17.599 --> 01:05:20.119
Just sad. I guess.

805
01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.960
But it was clear as day
that he adored that little girl.

806
01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.719
And how is she. by the way?
How's Emma?

807
01:05:28.719 --> 01:05:30.800
She's not so little anymore.

808
01:05:31.159 --> 01:05:33.039
It's a shame what happened.

809
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.079
- And I am so sorry.
- No. no. please. don't.

810
01:05:38.079 --> 01:05:40.239
I know that
he was threatening her.

811
01:05:40.239 --> 01:05:42.880
and I know that
you were trying to protect her.

812
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.760
so. please.
did he say anything to you?

813
01:05:46.719 --> 01:05:49.480
Before it happened?
Before you... had to shoot him?

814
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.119
He was obviously unwell.

815
01:05:55.599 --> 01:05:57.440
- But...
- But?

816
01:05:58.639 --> 01:06:00.239
One thing that stood out...

817
01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:03.840
something he said
I'll never be able to forget.

818
01:06:05.239 --> 01:06:06.400
What?

819
01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.199
He said...

820
01:06:11.639 --> 01:06:15.079
"There's something wrong with her.
I need to protect her from herself."

821
01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.880
And that's it.

822
01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:26.440
What if I told you he also said
that she would do it again.

823
01:06:28.079 --> 01:06:30.079
Do you know
what that might mean?

824
01:06:31.639 --> 01:06:33.000
No.

825
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.400
Emma. what are you doing here?

826
01:06:49.079 --> 01:06:52.079
Just checking on you.
Making sure you're still breathing.

827
01:06:57.119 --> 01:06:59.039
- This is cute.
- Leave it alone.

828
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.760
Emma. did you hear
that thunder?

829
01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:06.039
- It seems like a storm is coming in.
- Sounds like a doozy.

830
01:07:06.719 --> 01:07:08.760
Is there anything I can help you with
before you head out?

831
01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.920
No. I don't think so. I just want to get
out before the storm hits.

832
01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.239
Yeah. But thank you.

833
01:07:13.239 --> 01:07:15.239
- You're welcome.
- Okay. honey.

834
01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:18.400
Are you warm enough?
Yeah. okay. so...

835
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.000
- Take care.
- All right. Bye.

836
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.760
Okay.

837
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.360
Bye. Emma!
I'm leaving.

838
01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.159
Answer the phone.

839
01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:45.159
- What do you want. Emma?
- Hi. Kat. I didn't think you'd pick up.

840
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.039
Well. I did.

841
01:07:50.159 --> 01:07:52.079
Come on. Cora.
Pick up. pick up.

842
01:07:53.039 --> 01:07:55.199
I just kind of need
someone to talk to.

843
01:07:55.599 --> 01:07:57.519
Do you think
you could come over?

844
01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.119
Yeah. I just...

845
01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.800
I don't know...

846
01:08:07.559 --> 01:08:10.159
I really am a good person...
deep down.

847
01:08:11.559 --> 01:08:13.280
- Okay...
- I just can't go on like this.

848
01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.640
If you come over. I promise
I'll tell you everything.

849
01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.159
- Everything?
- Everything.

850
01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:24.000
Please? I just...

851
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.560
I'm so tired of being alone.

852
01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.159
And plus...

853
01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:32.119
I really need
to talk about Nathan.

854
01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.920
I really like him. and I don't know
what to do about it.

855
01:08:37.119 --> 01:08:40.880
Maybe you could just
give me advice or something.

856
01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:43.399
- All right?
- Okay. Emma.

857
01:08:44.439 --> 01:08:46.199
But only
if you tell me everything.

858
01:08:51.039 --> 01:08:52.119
Really?

859
01:08:52.119 --> 01:08:55.680
Yeah. I actually invited Kat over
to try and clear the air a little bit.

860
01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:58.600
- I think that's great. yeah.
- Yeah.

861
01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.840
She shouldn't stay
too long. though.

862
01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.600
so maybe you can come over
in. like. an hour or so?

863
01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:06.520
Really? That would be cool.
Okay. Yeah.

864
01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.920
Yeah. She'll probably be here any minute.
though. so I got to let you go.

865
01:09:11.239 --> 01:09:12.680
- Okay.
- All right.

866
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.159
- Bye.
- Bye.

867
01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.159
Hey. Come in. silly.

868
01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:54.079
I made us hot chocolate.
Just like my dad used to make.

869
01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.239
How is it?

870
01:10:19.359 --> 01:10:21.159
Good. I guess.

871
01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.880
What's up with Nathan? Is that what
you want to talk about. Emma?

872
01:10:25.439 --> 01:10:26.840
I just...

873
01:10:27.399 --> 01:10:29.800
I never really know
how to act around him.

874
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.359
Well. if you like him.
just be yourself.

875
01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.560
It's really nice
to have someone to talk to.

876
01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.119
I never really
have anyone to talk to.

877
01:10:41.159 --> 01:10:43.680
- Not really.
- Maybe there's a reason for that.

878
01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:48.439
It's hard to be different.
you know?

879
01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.439
Things have been
kind of crazy lately.

880
01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.000
- How so?
- My uncle...

881
01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.079
My step-uncle...

882
01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.119
he wanted to send me away
to a boarding school.

883
01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.319
He thought I was going to do
something to the baby.

884
01:11:04.319 --> 01:11:05.680
Did you?

885
01:11:11.119 --> 01:11:13.439
- The baby's fine.
- Your uncle isn't.

886
01:11:15.279 --> 01:11:17.840
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction.

887
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.520
Newton's Third Law.
That's basic physics.

888
01:11:29.079 --> 01:11:30.680
Accidents happen.

889
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.279
Come on!
Hurry up.

890
01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.960
Hurry up!

891
01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.039
- Steph? An accident?
- Exactly.

892
01:11:56.199 --> 01:11:57.520
And her dog?

893
01:11:59.159 --> 01:12:00.960
That was so tragic.

894
01:12:05.199 --> 01:12:08.359
And Milo and Mrs. Ellis?
And your dad. Emma?

895
01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.760
- Your own dad?
- He started it.

896
01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.239
- How?
- Hot chocolate.

897
01:12:19.279 --> 01:12:20.960
How was it by the way?

898
01:12:25.119 --> 01:12:26.680
Don't spill on my rug.

899
01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.279
There it is.

900
01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:32.840
It was taking so long.
I thought it might not work.

901
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.319
What did you give me?

902
01:12:48.279 --> 01:12:50.039
Everything.
Literally.

903
01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.039
- You won't get away with...
- Get away with this?

904
01:12:54.039 --> 01:12:55.720
You're so melodramatic.

905
01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.359
You wanna see something cool?

906
01:13:05.359 --> 01:13:07.880
- 911. What's your emergency?
- My god. please help me!

907
01:13:08.279 --> 01:13:10.840
My name is Emma Grossman!
There's this girl... she's insane!

908
01:13:11.159 --> 01:13:14.439
I invited her over to come and have hot
chocolate and she started a fire!

909
01:13:14.439 --> 01:13:16.720
She's attacking me!
Please help me!

910
01:13:22.319 --> 01:13:24.680
That was the sound
of me getting away with it.

911
01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.279
Works every time.

912
01:13:34.319 --> 01:13:35.880
I'm a psycho.

913
01:13:38.399 --> 01:13:39.840
That's fun to say.

914
01:13:42.439 --> 01:13:44.319
Too bad
no one will ever hear that.

915
01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.159
Mrs. Leyva. Milo.
Mrs. Ellis.

916
01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.560
Chloe. My dad.

917
01:13:53.159 --> 01:13:55.319
Stephanie
and that ridiculous dog.

918
01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.199
You. Uncle Robert.

919
01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.279
You guys all just
cause too much trouble.

920
01:14:00.279 --> 01:14:02.720
Don't mess with psychos.

921
01:14:05.359 --> 01:14:07.000
Really...

922
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.159
What did I just say?

923
01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.039
I mean. what are you
trying to do with this?

924
01:14:16.239 --> 01:14:17.560
God.

925
01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.439
- Now what are you going to do? Cry?
- Please.

926
01:14:21.359 --> 01:14:24.479
- You don't have to do this.
- Just go to sleep already. All right?

927
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.000
I hate to say it.
but this is getting a little boring.

928
01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:32.199
Thank you for the advice
about Nathan. Just be myself.

929
01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.439
I'll try.

930
01:14:34.439 --> 01:14:37.239
This wouldn't have been possible
without you.

931
01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:39.840
You really are
the best friend I've ever had.

932
01:14:45.239 --> 01:14:46.680
Emma...

933
01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.880
Emma?

934
01:15:20.119 --> 01:15:21.680
Angela. are you home?

935
01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:28.880
Hello?

936
01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.159
Angela?

937
01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.359
Emma?

938
01:16:11.079 --> 01:16:12.479
I'm coming. buddy!

939
01:16:14.239 --> 01:16:15.600
Daddy's coming.

940
01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.680
Yeah.
Here I come. buddy.

941
01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.680
Emma?

942
01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.199
Cade!

943
01:16:53.119 --> 01:16:54.800
Daddy's coming. buddy.

944
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.680
I'm coming. buddy.
Daddy's here.

945
01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:39.640
Everything's okay.

946
01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:03.800
Emma?

947
01:18:05.079 --> 01:18:06.600
What are you doing?

948
01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:09.039
Equal and opposite reactions.

949
01:18:10.159 --> 01:18:12.560
To be honest. it was probably always
going to end up this way.

950
01:18:16.319 --> 01:18:17.880
I am sorry. Robert.

951
01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:22.960
Sort of.

952
01:18:25.479 --> 01:18:26.840
Angela.

953
01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.000
Emma!

954
01:18:38.439 --> 01:18:40.439
- Aunt Angela!
- Emma! What did you do?

955
01:18:41.279 --> 01:18:43.000
- What?
- He was right about you!

956
01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:46.000
- What are you talking about?
- Your dad.

957
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.760
My brother. he loved you more
than anything. but he was right!

958
01:18:50.399 --> 01:18:51.960
You're a monster!

959
01:18:52.359 --> 01:18:54.760
You don't mean that!
Kat just tried to kill us!

960
01:18:55.399 --> 01:18:57.640
Liar!
What did you do to her?

961
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.960
To Robert?
What did you do. Emma?

962
01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.920
Angela!

963
01:19:04.199 --> 01:19:06.199
No... don't go.

964
01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:10.800
Robert!

965
01:19:15.239 --> 01:19:16.359
Robert!

966
01:19:33.239 --> 01:19:34.560
Hi. friend.

967
01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.960
Robert!

968
01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:05.079
Robert. wake up.
Robert. wake up. please!

969
01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:08.079
Come on.
Come on. get up!

970
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:10.600
Come on. we've got
to get you out of here!

971
01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.399
Come on. Robert.
Please!

972
01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.359
Help! Please!

973
01:20:52.279 --> 01:20:54.279
Please! My aunt!
She's still in there!

974
01:20:54.279 --> 01:20:56.199
This girl... she tried
to burn our house down.

975
01:20:56.199 --> 01:20:58.399
- Please! You've got to try and save her!
- You wait here!

976
01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.039
Emma! Are you okay?

977
01:21:06.039 --> 01:21:07.439
- My god.
- Jesus Christ.

978
01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:09.960
It's okay.
It's okay. it's okay.

979
01:21:10.479 --> 01:21:12.079
How the hell did this happen?

980
01:21:13.439 --> 01:21:15.319
It's okay.
It's okay. it's okay.

981
01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.600
So what's going to happen now?

982
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.479
We have an amazing woman
who can take you in

983
01:21:35.479 --> 01:21:37.359
until everything gets sorted.

984
01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.199
I'm so sorry. Emma.

985
01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.199
I can't imagine
how difficult this is for you.

986
01:21:44.319 --> 01:21:45.720
I loved my aunt.

987
01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.000
And my uncle.

988
01:21:51.079 --> 01:21:52.920
Can Cade and I
at least stay together?

989
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.560
We'll do our best.

990
01:21:58.279 --> 01:22:00.359
He's the only family
I have left.

991
01:22:04.279 --> 01:22:06.279
I need to make a few calls.

992
01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.079
Is there anything you need?

993
01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.199
Emma. you know
this isn't your fault.

994
01:22:24.279 --> 01:22:25.479
We'll be fine.

995
01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:30.800
We're Grossmans.
We rise above.

996
01:22:33.239 --> 01:22:34.680
Okay.
