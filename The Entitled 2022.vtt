3
00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.990
I don't feel so good.

4
00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:17.243
I feel like…

5
00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:19.537
taking a shit.

6
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:20.914
And I feel like…

7
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.877
I feel like puking too.

8
00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.838
Don't worry. They're nice people.

9
00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.049
Do I look okay?

10
00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:36.221
It's just that. I have no socks today.
I forgot to wash them.

11
00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.265
Why can't you look at me?

12
00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:40.642
Do I smell that bad?

13
00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:46.439
Well. it's good I came prepared.

14
00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.657
Aren't we there yet?
We’re so far from the gate already.

15
00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:01.579
Wow! Look at the horses!
And there's even a chapel in here!

16
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.249
What. my dad's house has a chapel?

17
00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.959
Wow.

18
00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:09.587
Woah! My dad is so rich!

19
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.674
Oh. the life of the rich--

20
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:24.894
The driver…

21
00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:27.272
He spat outside.

22
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.422
-Let me take care of this. ma'am.
-No. I got it.

23
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.173
-No. ma'am. Please. let me.
-Alright.

24
00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.989
I will always be grateful
for your service.

25
00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:32.045
I missed you so much. Daddy!
Thank you for looking for me.

26
00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.964
Daddy. I've waited so long
for this moment.

27
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:38.426
Thank you. I'm so glad you found me.

28
00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:39.719
Belinda. Be--

29
00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:44.933
You can't imagine
how long I waited. Unbelievable.

30
00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:45.934
Belinda…

31
00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.895
You look just like my neighbors.
I knew it.

32
00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.940
Belinda. wait. wait. Just a second.
Wait. wait. Come here.

33
00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:54.651
That's not your father.

34
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.028
He's not?

35
00:03:57.111 --> 00:03:58.655
So why were you crying too?

36
00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:01.115
My kid just died. so I'm resigning.

37
00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.826
Oh. condolences.

38
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.869
Belinda!

39
00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:06.829
Him?

40
00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.293
Welcome home. my dear!

41
00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.170
Did you hear all that?

42
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.589
-Yes.
-That was for you.

43
00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:25.682
All this time. your father’s been
searching for you.

44
00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.809
Thankfully. we can finally be together.

45
00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:29.852
I'm your Aunt Matilda.

46
00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.355
Caitlyn!

47
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.702
I left them outside--

48
00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.833
I left them outside. they're dirty.

49
00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:56.587
Maybe Belinda is more
used to a Japanese house.

50
00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:00.091
Whatever.

51
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.720
See. they're dirty. Wouldn't want
your floors to get dirty either.

52
00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.263
Yaya!

53
00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:07.307
Yes. madam?

54
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.891
Take Belinda to her room.

55
00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.893
She might want to settle in first.

56
00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.186
Yes. madam!

57
00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.694
Hey. shitface!

58
00:05:20.194 --> 00:05:22.113
You look like the people in my 'hood!

59
00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:24.282
I'll introduce you to them!

60
00:05:24.365 --> 00:05:26.200
You're the kind I wanna be with!
You're just like them!

61
00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.536
Well… we'll see you later. dear!

62
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.166
My room?

63
00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.461
What the fuck! This room is huge!

64
00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:38.046
Is this my bed? This?

65
00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:45.928
Who else is staying in this room? You?

66
00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.680
You can take that side.
I'll take this one.

67
00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:48.848
SiraXa's here.

68
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:49.849
Who?

69
00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:52.268
SiraXa. on lights.

70
00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:56.731
You want me to beg. SiraXa?

71
00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:05.990
Hey. Who was that?

72
00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:08.409
Call me when you're done freshening up.

73
00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.620
Hey. wait a second. Who's SiraXa?

74
00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.047
SiraXa?

75
00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:25.927
You're SiraXa?

76
00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:32.350
We can-- No!

77
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:33.976
Busted.

78
00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.193
Sweetie. let's just wait for your sister.

79
00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:49.242
Oh. shit! You guys waited for me?

80
00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.413
Have a seat.

81
00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:58.042
I had no idea you guys
were waiting for me.

82
00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:00.670
You should've called me.

83
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.007
Maybe she was enjoying herself because
she and SiraXa are pretty close now.

84
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.968
How is SiraXa?

85
00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:08.136
She's… dead.

86
00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:13.266
Oh. this?

87
00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.395
Your shower's too… confusing.
It's too high-tech.

88
00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:19.689
It's imported. with so many buttons.

89
00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:32.618
Yaya. can you please give
Belinda some burn ointment later?

90
00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.121
And don't call me ma'am.

91
00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.127
She was talking to me. not you!

92
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.004
She's such an attention whore.

93
00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:46.007
But if you're not comfortable.
you can call me Auntie.

94
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.092
"Auntie" for now. I'm still a little shy.

95
00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:52.472
But you know. I've never seen
a bathroom like yours!

96
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.807
You have that huge white basin
for doing laundry!

97
00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:59.020
I washed everything!
My panties. my bras. my socks.

98
00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:00.188
Everything!

99
00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:03.149
You know. we can wash
our neighbors' laundry too.

100
00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:04.358
We can make a lot of money.

101
00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:05.943
Your laundry area is massive!

102
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:06.861
Laundry area?

103
00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:08.154
The big white basin.

104
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.700
-You don't have to do that.
-What?

105
00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:15.495
You can give your dirty clothes
to Yaya Monina.

106
00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.497
And we'll shop for new clothes.

107
00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:25.630
This is all for us?

108
00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:27.089
Is this the last supper?

109
00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.591
Then we all know who Judas is.

110
00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.301
Her. She's Judas.

111
00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:47.360
I didn't know what you like eating.
so I had the chef cook all of this.

112
00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:49.654
Well. then…

113
00:08:50.404 --> 00:08:53.491
If I see food right in front of me.
I'll devour it!

114
00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:56.035
All for you and all for me.

115
00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:57.745
Let's eat!

116
00:08:57.828 --> 00:09:00.331
You aren't picky
when it comes to food. huh?

117
00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:01.999
You got that right.

118
00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:04.502
Wait!

119
00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:05.836
Don't eat it.

120
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.714
The meat is still raw. I see blood!

121
00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.592
Oh. my god! That's steak.

122
00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.469
That's how medium-rare steak is.

123
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:17.181
Hey. this is not a medium. This is large.

124
00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.599
-Maybe even XL.
-Okay.

125
00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:22.687
Yaya. please have Belinda's
steak well done.

126
00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:26.399
No. no need. I like blood stew.

127
00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:32.613
No need. No. I said I'll eat it already.

128
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.496
You look like a bulldog now!

129
00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.834
Don't worry. They'll serve you a new one.

130
00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.256
Wow. the pasta looks great.

131
00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:52.174
What are these green things on it?

132
00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.092
Malunggay?

133
00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:54.468
I've never seen anything like it.

134
00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:59.557
Where I’m from. it’s just pancit canton.
bihon. malabon. sometimes luglog.

135
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.976
But since malabon has thick noodles.
it's the best one.

136
00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:03.561
This is also pretty thick.

137
00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:10.276
Fuck! This is so good!

138
00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:12.737
I've never eaten anything
like this before! It's so good!

139
00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:17.408
It doesn't taste like stale food!
This is better! It's so good!

140
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:18.451
Belinda.

141
00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:19.619
Huh?

142
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.957
What?

143
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.090
Asshole!

144
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.342
You want a kiss?

145
00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.510
And right in front of my dad? Dumb shit.

146
00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:38.888
He wants a kiss. With tongue too?

147
00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.266
-You have something on your teeth!
-Huh?

148
00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.400
Gross!

149
00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.120
What are you doing out here?

150
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:06.457
Why? Am I not allowed to stay out here?

151
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.544
Back in Nalapok.
we could stay outside to get some air.

152
00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:11.796
Am I not allowed?

153
00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:13.047
No. it's okay.

154
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.048
But…

155
00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:24.433
Wow! Hold on--

156
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:25.768
Are you serious? This is for me?

157
00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:28.938
This is fancy. Thank you!

158
00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:30.564
You said this is mine. okay?
You can't take it back.

159
00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:31.941
No takebacks.

160
00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:33.192
-That's yours.
-It's pretty!

161
00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:40.616
I know this is all new to you.

162
00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:43.786
New? More like "alien" to me.

163
00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:47.456
You know. Belinda.
you have to get used to this.

164
00:11:48.707 --> 00:11:50.251
This is your life now.

165
00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:58.300
Maybe… I'm not yet used
to having a father.

166
00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:02.555
Look. I'm sorry.

167
00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:06.475
I can't take back
all those years we’ve lost.

168
00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:08.811
But…

169
00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:12.731
I can still make it up to you. right?

170
00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:18.737
It's unfortunate.
If only Mom were still alive to see this.

171
00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:22.241
I'm sure she'd be happy
to see the two of us together.

172
00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.034
I hope so.

173
00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:29.206
If she was mad. she would've
haunted me a long time ago.

174
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.459
I don't think she's mad. She's actually
smiling right there behind you.

175
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.715
I didn't know you were such a scaredy-cat.

176
00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:22.927
Ma'am?

177
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.264
Ma'am?

178
00:13:31.435 --> 00:13:32.645
Ma'am!

179
00:13:33.687 --> 00:13:35.523
What's happening to this woman?

180
00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:37.608
Ma'am?

181
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:38.734
Ma'am?

182
00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:06.011
I'm your type. huh?

183
00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:08.639
What the hell are you doing?

184
00:14:10.307 --> 00:14:12.977
I couldn't sleep.
The bed was too uncomfortable.

185
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.270
I'm used to sleeping on the floor.

186
00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:19.316
Are we having breakfast in bed?

187
00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:22.444
What do you think of me?
Room service? In the kitchen!

188
00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:25.781
Her breath stinks too.

189
00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:28.284
There it is!

190
00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:33.581
Where's my dad?

191
00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:35.708
He left early for work with Ma'am Matilda.

192
00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:38.419
How about Caitlyn?

193
00:14:38.502 --> 00:14:39.712
She's still sleeping.

194
00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:42.047
So this is all for me?

195
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:43.757
No one's joining me?

196
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:47.052
I can't eat all of this. Come on. join me.

197
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.554
I can't eat. I'm on an IF diet.

198
00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:49.722
IF diet?

199
00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:51.599
Oh. my gosh.
you don't even know what IF is?

200
00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:52.975
IF.

201
00:14:55.936 --> 00:14:58.314
Fine. but stay here.

202
00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:00.024
Let's talk.

203
00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:02.902
I want you to tell me
what my dad's interests are.

204
00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.445
What does he like?

205
00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:08.407
Does he like Raffy Tulfo? CongTV? Jamill?

206
00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.076
Or does he watch Zeinab?

207
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.202
Does he sing "Zebbianna"?

208
00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:13.370
Just add him on Facebook!

209
00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:15.497
Attorney!

210
00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.041
Attorney!

211
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.169
Have you eaten. Attorney?

212
00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:21.462
If you want. I can join you.

213
00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:24.256
Hey! I thought you were on an IF diet?

214
00:15:25.674 --> 00:15:27.384
IF 2.0.

215
00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:36.602
Yaya. I want milk tea! That's my favorite.

216
00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:39.146
I'll have an Okinawa.
with 100% sugar and pearls.

217
00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:40.230
We don't have milk tea!

218
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.150
Why aren't you prepared yet?

219
00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.611
Anyway. this is for you.

220
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:48.948
What's this?

221
00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.118
Wow. a cellphone!

222
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.498
In exchange for what?

223
00:15:57.581 --> 00:15:58.540
My pussy?

224
00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.125
What an expensive pussy.

225
00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:02.503
Last night. you wanted
a taste of my lips. and now this?

226
00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:05.130
Your dad got that for you.

227
00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:07.591
All the contacts are saved there.

228
00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:08.550
Including yours?

229
00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:09.802
Yes.

230
00:16:09.885 --> 00:16:11.595
It's my first time
to have a phone like this.

231
00:16:12.262 --> 00:16:14.890
Attorney. can you please help me
with this? I don't know how to use it.

232
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:15.975
Where's the camera?

233
00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:17.184
It's easy. I'll show you.

234
00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:20.437
Here.

235
00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:22.648
Come here. Let's take a selfie.
I look pretty here.

236
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:24.024
Check it out. My skin looks smooth here!

237
00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:26.151
Let's take a selfie.

238
00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:27.945
-Why?
-Because I look pretty in this camera.

239
00:16:28.028 --> 00:16:29.822
My skin is flawless. Just come over here.

240
00:16:32.741 --> 00:16:34.451
Come a little closer.

241
00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:36.912
Closer to my scalp.

242
00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.497
-What?
-Smell it!

243
00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:40.124
Closer.

244
00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:43.002
Okay. You better get ready. We have to go.

245
00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.296
Why can't you come near me?

246
00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:49.174
You have a crush on me. don't you?

247
00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:53.595
Look at you! Maybe you thought of me
when you touched yourself this morning.

248
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.142
Get off?

249
00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:00.602
Do you want me to say "jack off"?!

250
00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:01.937
You're so rude!

251
00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:04.690
What do you want me to say?
"Masturbate"? "Come"?

252
00:17:05.315 --> 00:17:08.360
Wait! Before this conversation
goes elsewhere…

253
00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:11.113
I'm here because I'm taking you
to your dad's office.

254
00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:18.203
Duh. I was with him yesterday. Obviously.

255
00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:23.417
Everybody looks up to him.
so please talk and act properly.

256
00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:28.839
See you in a minute.

257
00:17:29.506 --> 00:17:31.133
-I still have to eat all this.
-The game begins in three. two…

258
00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:33.260
I saw this on TV.
The one with Luis Manzano.

259
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.888
…one.

260
00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:41.393
What's wrong?

261
00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:44.271
Jacob. my stomach's acting up.

262
00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.356
You ate too much. That’s why.

263
00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:50.652
Wow! This place is huge!

264
00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.946
You're wearing the same color
as these guys. Is that your uniform?

265
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.740
Pick up the pace.
Your dad's waiting for you.

266
00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:59.787
Wow!

267
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.247
This is so grand!

268
00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:04.291
I feel like I'm in the States!

269
00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:05.626
Amazing!

270
00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:08.337
This is just one of the hotels
that your dad owns.

271
00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.464
Sir Enrico is a good businessman.

272
00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:12.341
that's why he was able to build an empire.

273
00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:17.096
But because he's so busy.
he forgets to eat or even sleep.

274
00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:21.475
And he needs more hands
to help him manage his hotels.

275
00:18:21.975 --> 00:18:25.020
Then why not Aunt Matilda?

276
00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.606
They spent a lot of time looking for you.

277
00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:32.194
Maybe he's thinking you'll
be able to help him run his empire.

278
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.363
But you might not be able to take it.

279
00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.698
Hey!

280
00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:39.284
This is Belinda of Nalapok
you're talking to.

281
00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:40.702
I can handle it!

282
00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:43.872
Of course I'll help my dad out!
He's my dad. Why won't I do it?

283
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:49.253
Whoever you see in the hotel
will be your staff.

284
00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:13.360
You have vomit all over your shoes.

285
00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:23.203
I'm feeling better now.

286
00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:25.247
I was pressured by Attorney earlier.

287
00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.791
He said. "You have a minute to win it!"
So I had to hurry and eat everything.

288
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:28.834
Oh. dear.

289
00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:31.378
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:33.672
I have to apologize as early as now.

291
00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:35.757
when I promised you
that I will make it up to you…

292
00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.348
You're leaving for China? That's okay.

293
00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:48.937
I know how busy you are
and you have a lot to do. so it's okay.

294
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:52.900
I always tell Enrico
to take it easy with work.

295
00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:55.235
He's not getting any younger.

296
00:19:55.319 --> 00:20:00.032
Especially now that our VP for Operations
recently resigned.

297
00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:03.452
He lost his right hand
in running the company.

298
00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:08.582
Isn't there anybody here
we can promote as vice president?

299
00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:11.877
Dear. HR can't find a qualified candidate.

300
00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:24.056
Wait. why don't we train Belinda?

301
00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:25.933
Belinda?

302
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.434
-Me?
-Yes!

303
00:20:27.517 --> 00:20:31.355
Sorry. dear. but she doesn't know anything
when it comes to running a company.

304
00:20:31.438 --> 00:20:33.941
No. wait. I can do it.

305
00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:35.525
Everything can be learned. anyway.

306
00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:38.237
And back in Nalapok. I can multitask.

307
00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:41.698
I clean. I cook. I iron.
all at the same time.

308
00:20:42.282 --> 00:20:43.325
I don't see why not.

309
00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.294
Hey. Attorney! Watch your words.

310
00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:56.838
You're right in front of my dad.
What will you show me?

311
00:20:57.756 --> 00:20:59.007
Can I see it now?

312
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:10.602
It's so quiet here.
Not even a word from anyone.

313
00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.229
Because this is a spa.

314
00:21:12.854 --> 00:21:16.733
I brought you here because
I want you to relax and de-stress

315
00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:20.988
before you start training.
and before you work.

316
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:22.698
-Really?
-Yes.

317
00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:25.450
There's an available room now.

318
00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:29.788
Sure.

319
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.296
It smells good.

320
00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:40.757
Do you smell that?

321
00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:44.761
Smells like doves or
those really fragrant flowers.

322
00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:46.221
What could that be?

323
00:21:49.766 --> 00:21:53.020
Belinda. have you ever tried flexing?

324
00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:57.357
Yeah. I do that a lot to pick fights
with people in my hood.

325
00:21:58.358 --> 00:22:00.527
Anyway. this is a different kind.

326
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.446
We get our own private rooms.

327
00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:04.323
That's why Mom went ahead.

328
00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:05.782
And so?

329
00:22:05.866 --> 00:22:07.784
When the attendant arrives.

330
00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:11.496
you have to ask her
where the comfort room is.

331
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.542
When you get there.
you have to take your clothes off.

332
00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:18.545
Like. you have to be totally naked.

333
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.792
Wait until your father hears about this!
You should not have done that!

334
00:23:01.004 --> 00:23:03.381
That was just a prank!
You're such a killjoy!

335
00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:06.802
A prank? That was not a good prank.
Delete that video now!

336
00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:19.147
Belinda. I'm so sorry.

337
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:23.610
You know how kids are these days.
They just love trouble.

338
00:23:23.693 --> 00:23:26.154
Oh. don't scold her anymore.

339
00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:27.781
They didn't see my pussy. anyway.

340
00:23:27.864 --> 00:23:29.032
Just the bush.

341
00:23:30.325 --> 00:23:32.452
Just hair. Promise!

342
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:44.214
Belinda. do you know
what a Brazilian wax is?

343
00:23:44.297 --> 00:23:46.091
Ma'am. are you ready?

344
00:23:46.174 --> 00:23:47.175
Yes.

345
00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:48.969
Take a deep breath.

346
00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:52.848
I'll be asking you some questions
to distract you from the pain.

347
00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:57.185
What is your favorite fruit?

348
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.728
Rambutan!

349
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:01.773
One more…

350
00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:04.359
-Okay. One. two. three…
-Ouch…

351
00:24:04.442 --> 00:24:06.444
What is your favorite vegetable?

352
00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:07.779
Snow cabbage!

353
00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:12.701
-One more.
-Snow cabbage.

354
00:24:13.201 --> 00:24:15.078
What is your favorite place?

355
00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:17.205
The pub!

356
00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:22.043
That's a lot of pubes. What the hell?

357
00:24:22.878 --> 00:24:24.754
A few more to go. ma'am.

358
00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:28.592
What's your favorite cartoon?

359
00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:30.177
Pokémon!

360
00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:35.599
Who is your favorite…

361
00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:37.392
actor?

362
00:24:38.393 --> 00:24:39.895
Boy Abunda!

363
00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:47.462
My vag… It's itchy…

364
00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:57.055
When we are all free.

365
00:25:57.639 --> 00:26:00.767
I'll schedule another family portrait.
Of course. including you.

366
00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:09.943
Don't worry about it. I understand.

367
00:26:10.026 --> 00:26:13.238
Just remember.
call me if you need anything.

368
00:26:13.321 --> 00:26:17.492
And you don't have to follow
everything that Jacob tells you.

369
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:20.537
If you're having a hard time.
you can actually say no.

370
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.541
Dad. I will give it my all
and never give up.

371
00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:27.043
I'm a fast learner. You'll see.

372
00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:28.628
You'll be proud of me.

373
00:26:39.306 --> 00:26:44.936
The first ballroom can accommodate
up to 600 guests. max capacity.

374
00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.023
Yes. and the junior ballroom
can accommodate

375
00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:51.192
250 to 300 guests. max capacity.

376
00:26:57.907 --> 00:27:00.035
-So. do you have any questions?
-Wait. hold on.

377
00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:04.622
What did you say again? From there.

378
00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:10.128
Are you telling me that
you weren't listening the whole time?

379
00:27:10.211 --> 00:27:11.463
Hey. I was!

380
00:27:11.546 --> 00:27:12.672
What?

381
00:27:12.756 --> 00:27:14.257
My dad owns all of this. Right?

382
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.384
-Anything else?
-Attorney.

383
00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:23.975
Six hundred--

384
00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:29.689
-Just go ahead.
-This way. Attorney.

385
00:27:33.568 --> 00:27:35.111
Finally. all by myself…

386
00:27:35.653 --> 00:27:38.156
Some TikTok trends
are about to go down here.

387
00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:42.243
How are you guys doing?

388
00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:43.620
Check this out.

389
00:27:43.703 --> 00:27:45.955
You don't see this in Nalapok!

390
00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:47.916
We do have these.
but with a lot of catfish.

391
00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:49.834
And here we have… oh.

392
00:27:50.668 --> 00:27:51.628
What's this?

393
00:27:51.711 --> 00:27:53.171
Let's check what's in here.

394
00:27:54.881 --> 00:27:56.091
Hey. Uncle Boy. this suits you.

395
00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:59.386
Hey! Are you the new intern
for housekeeping?

396
00:27:59.469 --> 00:28:01.346
Intern? What's that?

397
00:28:01.429 --> 00:28:03.014
Training! My goodness!

398
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:04.474
Are you here for training?

399
00:28:04.557 --> 00:28:07.143
Oh. yes! I was training and taking notes
over there. So. yes. I'm the trainee.

400
00:28:07.227 --> 00:28:09.813
Then. if that's the case.
what are you doing here?

401
00:28:09.896 --> 00:28:13.274
-My trainer left for--
-No! That can't be! Follow me.

402
00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:15.110
Let's clean the bathroom.

403
00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:17.695
-I was waiting for--
-Faster. Let's go. Push that.

404
00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:18.738
Let's go.

405
00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:20.907
-Push this?
-Push it!

406
00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:22.742
Attorney…

407
00:28:23.326 --> 00:28:26.663
Hurry up. All the floors
have to be spotless.

408
00:28:26.746 --> 00:28:29.499
All the way there.
They have to be squeaky clean.

409
00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:36.256
Where did she go?

410
00:28:36.756 --> 00:28:38.425
You need to clean that too!

411
00:28:38.508 --> 00:28:40.760
Ma'am. is this really part of my training?

412
00:28:40.844 --> 00:28:42.554
Of course!

413
00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:46.015
You millennials and your complaints.

414
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.228
Belinda?

415
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:58.278
She said this is part of my training.

416
00:28:58.361 --> 00:29:00.780
I have to make these floors spotless
because customers here are meticulous.

417
00:29:00.864 --> 00:29:02.782
Training? What training?

418
00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:05.660
Attorney. she's one of our interns here.

419
00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:07.829
Marjorie. do you know who she is?

420
00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:09.998
She is Belinda Buenavista.

421
00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:12.625
She is Enrico Buenavista's daughter.

422
00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:18.131
-I'm sorry. ma'am.
-It's okay.

423
00:29:18.214 --> 00:29:19.674
I'm sorry I won't be able to finish it.

424
00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:21.426
-Blame this guy.
-Let me do it.

425
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:24.471
This was really my job to begin with.

426
00:29:26.681 --> 00:29:31.144
Next time. don't just do
whatever people tell you to do.

427
00:29:31.227 --> 00:29:33.605
especially if you don't
even know who they are.

428
00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:36.649
Can you calm down?
I don't see what the big deal is.

429
00:29:36.733 --> 00:29:39.277
We always do that back home.

430
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.195
So it's no problem.

431
00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:42.781
Do what? Clean restrooms?

432
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:06.638
Don’t ever do that again.

433
00:30:06.721 --> 00:30:08.014
Just don’t.

434
00:30:08.097 --> 00:30:08.973
Okay. I'm so--

435
00:30:09.057 --> 00:30:10.683
Why did you bring me here anyway?

436
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:12.685
Is there something you want to do?

437
00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:17.106
I brought you here to show you this.

438
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.318
My office?

439
00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:24.405
This is my office.
That means. this is my table.

440
00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.533
And this is my chair.

441
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.410
Awesome chair. It looks like Satan's.

442
00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:30.745
Burn this.

443
00:30:31.287 --> 00:30:32.539
Burn that.

444
00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:34.290
Burn him as well.

445
00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:37.836
This is the company-issued laptop.

446
00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.254
Do you know how to use it?

447
00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:41.714
Back at home. we have
this thing called Piso Internet.

448
00:30:41.798 --> 00:30:46.094
It's like a box where
you put a dime in for the Internet.

449
00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.972
Okay. I'll show you. It's like this.

450
00:30:49.055 --> 00:30:51.641
Open it like this
and it'll automatically turn on.

451
00:30:51.724 --> 00:30:52.892
That easy.

452
00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:54.894
Woah. it turned on…

453
00:30:55.562 --> 00:30:58.356
You'll eventually have
your own staff when you start.

454
00:30:58.439 --> 00:31:00.191
But in the meantime. we'll be with you.

455
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.658
So you and Aunt Matilda
will be my staff here.

456
00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:10.493
No.

457
00:31:10.577 --> 00:31:11.870
Sorry.

458
00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:14.789
Who else will be here?

459
00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:17.584
Don't tell me another random voice is here

460
00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:20.044
to scare me off like a ghost
and tell me what to do.

461
00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:25.425
I fell asleep while waiting for you.
What took you so long. ma'am?

462
00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:27.927
Attorney…

463
00:31:33.516 --> 00:31:36.436
Your dad asked her
to be your personal assistant.

464
00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:38.605
From now on. if you have any requests.

465
00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:42.817
like things to do or buy.
you can tell her.

466
00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:46.988
She's my kind
so I know I'll be comfortable.

467
00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:49.741
You know. back in Nalapok.
you wouldd see this type of face a lot.

468
00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:50.658
Look at her face.

469
00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:53.745
She looks like one of the vendors
back home and our laundry lady.

470
00:31:53.828 --> 00:31:56.289
Look. a perfect example of a generic face.

471
00:31:56.372 --> 00:31:57.916
A lot of people look like that.

472
00:31:57.999 --> 00:31:59.500
She looks like a squid.

473
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:12.263
When you are being introduced to someone.
be the first to reach your hand out.

474
00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:18.645
-Belinda.
-Your hand…

475
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.522
-Offer my hand?
-Yes.

476
00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:24.609
To a stranger? No way!
What if they rob me?

477
00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:45.880
Okay. pretend that this is the first time
you're meeting Attorney Jacob.

478
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:47.715
and I've introduced you to each other.

479
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:53.972
Wow!

480
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:57.392
Your hands are as soft as a woman's.

481
00:32:57.976 --> 00:33:00.269
I mean. just look at your nails.
No ingrowns.

482
00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:01.813
Do you regularly get a manicure?

483
00:33:01.896 --> 00:33:02.855
Belinda!

484
00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:05.525
Can you please
take your training seriously?

485
00:33:11.114 --> 00:33:16.244
That's why it's important
to give a good first impression.

486
00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:18.746
While you shake hands.

487
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.332
maintain eye contact

488
00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:23.334
with the person you're shaking hands with.

489
00:33:23.418 --> 00:33:24.669
Eye contact?

490
00:33:24.752 --> 00:33:29.257
Because. if you're looking
at the person's eyes.

491
00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.050
it shows that you're confident

492
00:33:31.134 --> 00:33:33.553
and sincere.

493
00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:36.389
There you go.

494
00:33:36.472 --> 00:33:40.435
While looking at the person's eyes.

495
00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:43.271
you can also smile
while doing a handshake.

496
00:33:50.653 --> 00:33:53.865
Belinda?

497
00:33:54.407 --> 00:33:55.408
Belinda!

498
00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:01.372
Smile a little while you do the handshake.

499
00:34:19.807 --> 00:34:20.850
I look constipated.

500
00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:23.644
And the most important thing.

501
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.897
the handshake should be firm.

502
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.740
-Ouch!
-Why?

503
00:34:37.283 --> 00:34:38.493
Gentle.

504
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:44.290
Wait.

505
00:34:46.959 --> 00:34:48.961
This is the part of training
I've been waiting for. the food.

506
00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:50.546
I haven't tried any of this before.

507
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.390
I can't do that.

508
00:35:01.474 --> 00:35:02.433
Is she crazy?

509
00:35:02.517 --> 00:35:05.686
I've been training for days now
and you want me to starve?

510
00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.188
What am I. a little bird?

511
00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:09.148
That can't be.
I'm going to eat all of this.

512
00:35:13.569 --> 00:35:16.739
I've tried beef stew.
street food. and noodles.

513
00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:20.284
Sometimes our neighbor
would even treat us.

514
00:35:20.368 --> 00:35:21.244
Burgers.

515
00:35:22.662 --> 00:35:24.705
But on the first bite. it's just bread.

516
00:35:26.707 --> 00:35:31.504
So you can practice
and you're not only learning theories.

517
00:35:31.587 --> 00:35:33.339
I'd like that!

518
00:35:33.422 --> 00:35:36.008
You have to come. Ms. Missy.
I wouldn't know what to order there.

519
00:35:37.844 --> 00:35:38.970
Attorney. will!

520
00:35:46.394 --> 00:35:47.770
We'll go out on a date?

521
00:35:50.022 --> 00:35:53.025
I got it!
That means someone ugly will arrive!

522
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:55.403
The fork was facing that direction.
It should be like this.

523
00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:58.656
I should be with them on that date.

524
00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:01.325
I am… is a must!

525
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:15.715
You made her cry.
She wasn't crying earlier.

526
00:36:15.798 --> 00:36:17.216
She started crying when you arrived!

527
00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:18.926
Me?

528
00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:23.973
Smell it!

529
00:36:25.558 --> 00:36:27.268
Belinda. can you stop holding your butt?

530
00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:31.522
But this dress is too tight.
It's giving me a wedgie.

531
00:36:32.899 --> 00:36:35.359
What's with that reaction?
As if you don't have an ass?

532
00:36:36.652 --> 00:36:37.904
Pretentious bitch!

533
00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:47.538
Can I see yours?

534
00:36:48.581 --> 00:36:49.457
Belinda!

535
00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:00.509
-On the lap.
-Lap.

536
00:37:03.346 --> 00:37:05.723
If you don't know what to do
and you're unsure.

537
00:37:05.806 --> 00:37:10.228
just look around and observe
what other people are doing.

538
00:37:10.811 --> 00:37:12.980
Look at them and imitate them.

539
00:37:21.364 --> 00:37:22.406
What's with that?

540
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:23.491
He glared at me.

541
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.118
You told me to copy them.

542
00:37:26.202 --> 00:37:27.787
How do we do this?

543
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.124
Okay. don't be confused
with all the cutlery you see.

544
00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:35.878
Remember. we always start
from the outermost one.

545
00:37:36.462 --> 00:37:38.422
-This one?
-Which one's the outermost? Correct.

546
00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:42.093
Remember what you learned.

547
00:37:42.677 --> 00:37:44.303
You have to scoop like this.

548
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.848
Why the small serving?

549
00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:50.059
Give me more. We're paying for it. anyway.

550
00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:53.354
Scoop gently.

551
00:37:55.731 --> 00:37:56.565
Delicious!

552
00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:00.695
With poise. please.

553
00:38:21.924 --> 00:38:23.050
Belinda!

554
00:38:53.581 --> 00:38:55.166
Oh. sorry. I asked too many questions.

555
00:38:57.293 --> 00:38:59.086
Whatever you ask. I'll answer.

556
00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:05.801
Did you get your nose done?

557
00:39:06.552 --> 00:39:07.678
And…

558
00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:09.638
You have big boobs!

559
00:39:09.722 --> 00:39:10.723
Are those real?

560
00:39:10.806 --> 00:39:11.724
Like. legit?

561
00:39:15.227 --> 00:39:16.228
Is she the one?

562
00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:31.243
So…

563
00:39:32.161 --> 00:39:34.246
-I'll keep in touch.
-Yeah. Okay.

564
00:39:38.084 --> 00:39:39.585
Looks like she got a butt job. too.

565
00:39:39.668 --> 00:39:42.421
You don't need to say everything out loud.

566
00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:44.673
Especially when you're meeting them
for the first time.

567
00:39:44.757 --> 00:39:47.676
Why? I said good things about her.
I even complimented her ass.

568
00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.720
Watch your words!

569
00:39:50.763 --> 00:39:53.724
-Fire! There's fire!
-Where are you going? Belinda!

570
00:39:59.105 --> 00:40:00.272
-Sorry!
-Belinda!

571
00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:04.568
-Sorry.
-Bitch!

572
00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:06.237
Jacob. are you mad?

573
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.696
I'm sorry.

574
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:08.697
Jacob…

575
00:40:08.781 --> 00:40:12.076
So you really did not learn
a thing from Ms. Missy. huh?

576
00:40:12.159 --> 00:40:15.037
You are not taking any of this seriously!

577
00:40:15.538 --> 00:40:16.997
And you're dragging me down with you!

578
00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.834
Don't you know
how embarrassed I was in there?

579
00:40:21.502 --> 00:40:22.420
I'm sorry.

580
00:40:23.963 --> 00:40:25.172
I'm sorry. Jacob.

581
00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:29.260
I was born and raised in Nalapok.

582
00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:31.887
I don't see anything wrong
with what I did in there

583
00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:33.514
because that's how we all are back home.

584
00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:35.433
I don't know how to be fancy.

585
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:37.726
I'm not the best at English.

586
00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:41.230
And we don't get to eat
in restaurants like these.

587
00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:45.734
I can't do that with my mouth shut.

588
00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:48.654
But I know it's not an excuse.

589
00:40:48.737 --> 00:40:51.949
It's not a good reason for you
to feel ashamed when you're with me.

590
00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:55.202
But I am willing to learn.

591
00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:57.538
I promise.

592
00:40:58.539 --> 00:41:00.916
If that's what it takes
to please my dad. I will do it.

593
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.711
Just give me another chance.

594
00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:05.379
Especially you. Jacob.

595
00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:08.424
I need a little more patience and…

596
00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:13.637
a little more time to learn all of this…

597
00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:15.848
if that's okay.

598
00:41:17.224 --> 00:41:18.100
Please?

599
00:41:21.896 --> 00:41:24.523
This… is for soup. I know it is.

600
00:41:24.607 --> 00:41:25.566
What's this for?

601
00:41:28.611 --> 00:41:31.614
Yaya Mo. please help me.

602
00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:33.824
Find it out for yourself.

603
00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:37.244
Please! I just want to impress Jacob.

604
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:39.246
If you help me with this.

605
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.916
I'll let you watch your favorite videos.

606
00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:44.585
Without interruption.

607
00:41:56.889 --> 00:41:58.682
I hope that's not in English again.

608
00:42:01.477 --> 00:42:02.520
Is that Mommy Onin?

609
00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.272
-You also watch her FB live?
-Yes!

610
00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:07.066
She's my favorite. Holy shit!

611
00:42:07.149 --> 00:42:09.193
I was gonna shave my head for her!

612
00:42:09.276 --> 00:42:12.279
That son of a bitch. Rob.
he bought four BMWs.

613
00:42:16.242 --> 00:42:17.743
Really? Thank you! What is it?

614
00:42:17.826 --> 00:42:19.161
A first-class etiquette lesson.

615
00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.625
I'm gonna show you how to be fancy.

616
00:42:41.267 --> 00:42:42.184
Wait!

617
00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:27.396
Napkin goes on the lap.

618
00:43:27.479 --> 00:43:29.440
No elbows on the table.

619
00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:33.319
And no talking when your mouth is full.

620
00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:39.533
Again. no talking when you
have a mouth full of food.

621
00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:44.038
Start with the outermost cutlery.
going inward.

622
00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:46.123
For dessert.

623
00:43:46.206 --> 00:43:48.292
We already started with the soup.

624
00:43:48.876 --> 00:43:50.377
This is for the main course.

625
00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:52.004
So did I pass the test?

626
00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:58.844
Does that mean we'll go out
on another date?

627
00:43:58.927 --> 00:44:00.095
This is not a date.

628
00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:03.015
You know. you're actually my first date.

629
00:44:03.098 --> 00:44:05.225
Again. this is not a date.

630
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:07.686
You can also be my first fuck.

631
00:44:08.854 --> 00:44:09.855
Belinda!

632
00:44:09.938 --> 00:44:12.107
What did I say wrong this time?

633
00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:13.567
I only said you'd be the first.

634
00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:19.865
We'll see if you really learned something.

635
00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:25.245
Jacob. you do know that

636
00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:28.082
I'm not used to these kinds of food

637
00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:29.708
or these kinds of dishes.

638
00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:33.003
We consider ourselves lucky
if we have food to eat at Nalapok.

639
00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:35.297
So how am I supposed to know all this?

640
00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:39.301
Maybe for you.
you grew up with food like this.

641
00:44:39.385 --> 00:44:41.095
Because you seem to be
very familiar with it.

642
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:42.763
I can't remember.

643
00:44:43.389 --> 00:44:46.934
You know what I used to
bring to school as a kid?

644
00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:49.436
For us. an egg is enough.

645
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.273
And that egg could
either be fried or boiled.

646
00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:58.362
Then we'd pair it
with eggplant. okra. or tomato.

647
00:44:58.445 --> 00:44:59.488
It's really delicious!

648
00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:03.158
So this prawn herbivore…

649
00:45:03.951 --> 00:45:05.160
"Thermidor".

650
00:45:06.412 --> 00:45:08.539
"Prawn thermidor".

651
00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:12.042
Yeah. but when I eat all this.

652
00:45:12.126 --> 00:45:15.045
it'll all be the same
when they're in my belly.

653
00:45:15.629 --> 00:45:20.676
Thermidor. terminator. thermometer. whore…

654
00:45:24.346 --> 00:45:27.474
You laughed. That's a first.

655
00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:28.392
No.

656
00:45:28.475 --> 00:45:30.227
I saw you laugh.

657
00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:31.311
I saw you.

658
00:45:31.937 --> 00:45:35.274
A fork for the prawn thermidor.

659
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.910
This place is really different
in the morning and at night.

660
00:45:46.994 --> 00:45:49.371
Right? It's really nice here at night.

661
00:45:49.872 --> 00:45:51.999
We have the place to ourselves.

662
00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:57.463
I go here when I want to
clear my head and de-stress.

663
00:45:57.546 --> 00:45:59.673
to forget about my problems.

664
00:46:00.215 --> 00:46:01.383
I get to recharge.

665
00:46:01.467 --> 00:46:02.968
All my worries go away when I'm here.

666
00:46:04.178 --> 00:46:06.221
Is it hard to be a lawyer?

667
00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:12.019
But it has always been my dream
since I was a kid.

668
00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:14.229
That's amazing.

669
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:17.983
You already knew
what you wanted to be ever since.

670
00:46:18.066 --> 00:46:19.318
What about you?

671
00:46:19.401 --> 00:46:21.570
What was your childhood dream?

672
00:46:22.654 --> 00:46:23.697
Nothing.

673
00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.740
Nothing?

674
00:46:25.991 --> 00:46:26.992
How can that be?

675
00:46:27.075 --> 00:46:31.246
Well. for us at Nalapok.

676
00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:38.128
we don't really think about
what we want to be when we grow up

677
00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:40.380
because it won't happen for us. anyway.

678
00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:45.469
We'd rather make sure
we have food on the table

679
00:46:45.552 --> 00:46:50.015
and not complicate things.

680
00:46:50.098 --> 00:46:51.767
We want things that we can get.

681
00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:54.269
But now.

682
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.647
I only have one dream.

683
00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:02.194
And that is for my father
to fully accept me.

684
00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:09.785
But he doesn't need to tell the world.

685
00:47:10.452 --> 00:47:14.915
I just need to know that he's not
ashamed to have me as a daughter.

686
00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:22.297
Why?

687
00:47:23.924 --> 00:47:24.967
Nothing.

688
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:26.969
Sadness doesn't suit you.

689
00:47:27.052 --> 00:47:28.136
What am I. a clown?

690
00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.429
Sometimes.

691
00:47:31.265 --> 00:47:33.267
So I make you happy. huh?

692
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:38.188
What about your Barbie doll friend.

693
00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:39.523
does she make you happy?

694
00:47:39.606 --> 00:47:40.649
Who? Trixie?

695
00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:43.026
-Yes. Is she your ex?
-No.

696
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:44.736
-Did you court her?
-No.

697
00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.030
She's your fu-bu?

698
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.533
Fu-bu?

699
00:47:49.616 --> 00:47:51.702
Duh. "fuck buddy."

700
00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:55.497
You laughed!

701
00:47:55.581 --> 00:47:57.207
That means it's true.

702
00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:58.542
What. so it is?

703
00:47:58.625 --> 00:48:02.045
-You can't stop laughing.
-I'm not like that.

704
00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:03.255
But you're still laughing.

705
00:48:03.338 --> 00:48:06.133
-Because you're funny.
-Because you're a fuck boy.

706
00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:08.176
I'm not… I'm not that kind of guy.

707
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.429
-I'm not that kind of guy.
-Now I know you like having fu-bu's.

708
00:48:10.512 --> 00:48:12.097
-I have another joke.
-Okay. let's hear it.

709
00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.516
What did the booger say
to the booger beside it?

710
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.601
What?

711
00:48:15.684 --> 00:48:17.060
"Bro. I'll go ahead."

712
00:48:19.438 --> 00:48:20.814
Because he got picked already.

713
00:48:22.107 --> 00:48:24.192
-Okay. I also have a joke for you.
-You do?

714
00:48:24.276 --> 00:48:25.235
-I do.
-Okay. go.

715
00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:29.448
What did the eyebrow say
to the other eyebrow?

716
00:48:29.948 --> 00:48:30.907
What?

717
00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:32.075
"Hi bro-w!"

718
00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:35.746
I'll say it again.

719
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:37.247
"Hi bro-w!"

720
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.166
That was so corny.

721
00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:40.626
What kind of joke is that?

722
00:48:40.709 --> 00:48:42.753
We've never heard of those jokes
where I'm from.

723
00:48:47.674 --> 00:48:49.384
-Thank you.
-Me too.

724
00:48:49.468 --> 00:48:50.969
Thank you.

725
00:48:55.057 --> 00:48:56.183
-I'll go ahead.
-I'll go ahead.

726
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.735
-This is your house.
-You're the one leaving.

727
00:49:06.818 --> 00:49:08.695
-That's right. I'm leaving.
-And I'll stay here.

728
00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:12.699
I'll just… I'll stay put here.

729
00:49:13.867 --> 00:49:15.494
So this is good night.

730
00:49:23.335 --> 00:49:26.421
Thank you very much. Belinda.
I had fun tonight.

731
00:49:26.505 --> 00:49:28.131
You really made me happy.

732
00:49:28.215 --> 00:49:29.383
Me too.

733
00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:31.426
Thank you. You made me so happy.

734
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:56.159
I'll see you soon. bro.

735
00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:20.183
If you're be happy with her.

736
00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:23.478
I will not stop you.

737
00:50:24.062 --> 00:50:26.815
All I ask is that.

738
00:50:26.898 --> 00:50:29.818
she takes care of you and loves you.

739
00:50:32.988 --> 00:50:34.072
Jacob…

740
00:50:36.825 --> 00:50:37.743
Ouch!

741
00:50:37.826 --> 00:50:39.077
Oh. my gosh. a rat!

742
00:50:42.247 --> 00:50:43.248
It’s just me.

743
00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.668
I'm very happy for the two of you.

744
00:50:46.752 --> 00:50:49.087
I wish for a good future ahead of you.

745
00:50:49.171 --> 00:50:50.839
A happy future.

746
00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:56.386
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

747
00:50:57.596 --> 00:50:59.222
Don't! Don't look at me like that.

748
00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:02.434
I'm okay. I swear. I promise!

749
00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:08.607
And then. I opened the door.

750
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:11.610
and Yaya Monina was there.
I accidentally pushed her.

751
00:51:11.693 --> 00:51:13.361
-I actually thought it was a rat.
-Really?

752
00:51:13.445 --> 00:51:15.530
-"Oh. my gosh. a rat!"
-And then what happened?

753
00:51:15.614 --> 00:51:17.115
So she got hit.

754
00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:21.411
What will we do today with Ms. Missy?

755
00:51:26.458 --> 00:51:27.626
What?

756
00:51:27.709 --> 00:51:30.337
No way! I wouldn't know
what to say in there.

757
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.671
No. you don't have to worry

758
00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:35.133
because all you have to do
is sit down and listen.

759
00:51:35.217 --> 00:51:39.054
It's important for you to be familiar
with what's happening in the company.

760
00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:41.014
Okay. If you say so.

761
00:51:41.097 --> 00:51:42.682
And a reminder.

762
00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:44.351
it's better for you to take down notes.

763
00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:46.728
just in case a board member
asks you questions.

764
00:51:46.812 --> 00:51:48.146
So you'll be prepared.

765
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.105
Okay?

766
00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:51.024
-Someone's going to ask me a question?
-Yes.

767
00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:53.860
Now I have another meeting to run to.
so I'll see you there. Okay?

768
00:51:54.569 --> 00:51:55.445
See you!

769
00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:15.841
-See?
-Yes?

770
00:52:15.924 --> 00:52:19.511
I think we should focus on
providing experiences

771
00:52:19.594 --> 00:52:21.096
to capture their loyalty.

772
00:52:35.068 --> 00:52:37.696
I have to take a dump.
Where's the restroom?

773
00:52:41.032 --> 00:52:42.200
Take notes for me.

774
00:53:06.641 --> 00:53:09.978
Hey. girl. have you seen
Mr. Buenavista's daughter?

775
00:53:10.061 --> 00:53:11.855
Yeah. Caitlyn?

776
00:53:14.649 --> 00:53:16.776
She's Sir Enrico's daughter
with a different woman.

777
00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.404
and she is so different from Caitlyn.

778
00:53:19.487 --> 00:53:22.198
She's so lucky.
From rags to riches that quick.

779
00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:23.950
All because her dad is rich.

780
00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:25.243
Lucky indeed.

781
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:31.583
-Gross! It stinks!
-Ew.

782
00:53:31.666 --> 00:53:33.084
It smells so bad! Ew!

783
00:53:33.168 --> 00:53:34.669
Oh. my god. what is that?

784
00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:36.421
-It’s so gross!
-So bad!

785
00:53:36.963 --> 00:53:38.381
-It really stinks!
-Stinks!

786
00:53:39.758 --> 00:53:41.051
Ma’am.

787
00:53:41.134 --> 00:53:42.636
We're sorry. ma'am.

788
00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:43.845
We're really sorry.

789
00:53:43.929 --> 00:53:47.057
-Can you still smell it?
-Yes. ma'am. It really stinks.

790
00:53:47.974 --> 00:53:49.184
We're sorry. ma'am.

791
00:53:51.603 --> 00:53:54.439
Attorney Jacob.
Ma'am Belinda hasn't returned.

792
00:53:54.522 --> 00:53:56.733
What? Didn't she just… I'll look for her.

793
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:06.117
"I have to take a dump."

794
00:54:08.036 --> 00:54:10.956
-Okay. One more time.
-Sure. ma'am.

795
00:54:11.039 --> 00:54:12.290
Did you practice this already?

796
00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:16.252
Let's do this.

797
00:54:16.878 --> 00:54:18.338
Can you keep up?

798
00:54:29.182 --> 00:54:31.726
Wait a second. Let's check it first.

799
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.395
It's true what they say about you. ma'am.

800
00:54:33.478 --> 00:54:35.188
You’re so different from Caitlyn.

801
00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:37.857
We're really sorry
for gossiping about you earlier.

802
00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:40.193
-Yes. ma'am. We're really sorry.
-That's okay. I'm a gossip girl too.

803
00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:44.864
Just tell me if you see anything wrong
so I can correct it. okay?

804
00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:46.992
Enough with the chit-chat.

805
00:54:47.075 --> 00:54:50.161
-All right.
-One more time.

806
00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.712
You're so good at this. ma'am.

807
00:54:59.337 --> 00:55:01.673
-Hey. Attorney! Come here.
-Don’t make me do it.

808
00:55:01.756 --> 00:55:05.969
Join us. I know you were
dancing to it while watching us.

809
00:55:06.553 --> 00:55:08.054
Don't drag me into this.

810
00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:11.683
Attorney. this is easy. Come on!

811
00:55:11.766 --> 00:55:13.393
-Okay. fine.
-I know you know this.

812
00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:14.602
Let's do it.

813
00:55:19.899 --> 00:55:20.859
Other side.

814
00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:23.028
Who knew Attorney's body
would be this stiff?

815
00:55:23.111 --> 00:55:24.446
He needs to loosen up.

816
00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:26.364
Dance like a Sexbomb dancer!

817
00:55:26.948 --> 00:55:29.242
-Such a stiff body!
-One more time.

818
00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:30.535
Okay. Hit play.

819
00:55:31.453 --> 00:55:32.412
Okay.

820
00:55:42.922 --> 00:55:44.466
And the hands…

821
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:55.268
You'll be impressed
with Belinda's progress.

822
00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:56.186
Oh. really?

823
00:55:56.269 --> 00:55:57.729
-Yeah.
-Let's do some TikToks again later.

824
00:55:57.812 --> 00:55:59.355
-I'll dance with you guys.
-Sure.

825
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:04.069
Belinda!

826
00:56:04.152 --> 00:56:05.361
You're home.

827
00:56:06.404 --> 00:56:07.989
Hi. Aunt Matilda.

828
00:56:09.824 --> 00:56:11.910
I heard you're doing well
in your training.

829
00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:25.256
Ms. Missy said--

830
00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.342
No way. I doubt it.

831
00:56:27.425 --> 00:56:29.385
I still have a lot more to learn.

832
00:56:29.469 --> 00:56:31.304
You're so humble. Belinda.

833
00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:47.904
You'll introduce her to the stockholders?

834
00:56:47.987 --> 00:56:50.365
What? No. I'm not yet ready.

835
00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:51.783
Not yet.

836
00:56:54.536 --> 00:56:56.496
That's how I learned it.

837
00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:13.179
Why are you still up?

838
00:57:15.014 --> 00:57:16.599
I can't sleep.

839
00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:17.684
You?

840
00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:19.769
I can't sleep either.

841
00:57:23.356 --> 00:57:24.732
-I'm nervous.
-I'm nervous.

842
00:57:25.358 --> 00:57:26.985
-Why are you nervous?
-Why are you nervous?

843
00:57:29.821 --> 00:57:32.198
You heard what Daddy said earlier. right?

844
00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:37.745
He said he was going to introduce me
to the stockholders and bosses.

845
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:40.623
What if they don't like me?

846
00:57:40.707 --> 00:57:42.125
What if I fuck up?

847
00:57:42.709 --> 00:57:44.127
How about you?

848
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:46.421
Why can't you sleep?

849
00:57:49.507 --> 00:57:50.967
I drank too much coffee.

850
00:57:53.928 --> 00:57:56.264
But I'm also worried for you.

851
00:57:57.765 --> 00:58:00.685
Why? Do you think something bad
will happen tomorrow?

852
00:58:00.768 --> 00:58:01.978
Not like that.

853
00:58:02.061 --> 00:58:06.441
I'm nervous for you. but in a good way.

854
00:58:06.524 --> 00:58:08.109
I'm excited for you.

855
00:58:08.693 --> 00:58:10.653
I'm not ready. Not yet.

856
00:58:11.279 --> 00:58:16.367
You know. in our province.
our mayor ran for senator.

857
00:58:16.451 --> 00:58:19.913
Then he made his son run for mayor.

858
00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:22.749
Even if he knows nothing
about politics. he still won.

859
00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:26.586
You know what else he had?

860
00:58:27.378 --> 00:58:28.880
Confidence.

861
00:58:31.424 --> 00:58:32.383
Do you get it now?

862
00:58:32.467 --> 00:58:33.801
I know what to do now.

863
00:58:35.386 --> 00:58:36.763
I'll run for mayor.

864
00:58:39.265 --> 00:58:40.391
I'm kidding.

865
00:58:40.475 --> 00:58:45.146
What I meant was.
I'll do my best and let's see.

866
00:58:46.731 --> 00:58:47.899
Hey.

867
00:58:48.483 --> 00:58:52.695
Thanks for all your help.

868
00:58:52.779 --> 00:58:54.864
I'll miss you.

869
00:58:58.993 --> 00:59:00.078
What are you trying to do?

870
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:02.080
Fooled you. I was going for your cheek.

871
00:59:02.163 --> 00:59:03.581
I'm not on your love team.

872
00:59:03.665 --> 00:59:05.792
You talk as if you're
on the losing end of the stick.

873
00:59:11.839 --> 00:59:13.007
You can do it.

874
00:59:16.094 --> 00:59:18.179
Belinda Buenavista.

875
00:59:32.777 --> 00:59:34.112
Oh. fuck!

876
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.156
Oh. my god!

877
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.074
What did she say?

878
00:59:39.117 --> 00:59:40.827
"Fuck"? Did I hear it right?

879
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:46.916
I'm really glad to finally meet you all.

880
00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:51.754
Ah. okay. Okay.

881
01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:04.809
Nice to meet you. sir.

882
01:00:04.892 --> 01:00:07.687
And of course.
his beautiful wife. Michelle.

883
01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:08.938
Nice to meet you. ma'am.

884
01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:10.023
This is Frank Smith.

885
01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:16.738
Good job!

886
01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.409
We can proceed with our plan.

887
01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.204
Yes. ma'am.

888
01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.658
What do you think? Did I do okay?

889
01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:05.912
I think it would've been perfect
if I didn't trip. Right?

890
01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:07.705
Your dad is really proud of you.

891
01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.291
Hey!

892
01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:13.628
Just my dad? What about you?

893
01:01:13.711 --> 01:01:14.879
Shouldn't you be proud too?

894
01:01:14.962 --> 01:01:18.508
You're the reason
I'm able to do all of this.

895
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:20.468
Aren't you proud?

896
01:01:20.551 --> 01:01:22.178
Belinda!

897
01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:25.890
I've been looking for you!

898
01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:30.228
Hey! Let's talk later.

899
01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:35.316
So why are you being nice to me?

900
01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.612
You did good up there!

901
01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.572
Really? Well. thank you.

902
01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:52.917
It's good. isn't it?

903
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.086
It's good. Bittersweet.

904
01:01:55.169 --> 01:01:56.838
Sweet? There's more over there. Let's go.

905
01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:03.678
Oh! Here. This is really good.

906
01:02:05.304 --> 01:02:06.639
Caitlyn. I don't really drink.

907
01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.641
Come on. Just try it.

908
01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:11.102
-There you go.
-This is imported.

909
01:02:11.185 --> 01:02:12.019
Nice!

910
01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:13.396
I think that's enough.

911
01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:14.772
-Dad might see us. Caitlyn.
-Come on. One shot.

912
01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.065
-We might--
-Cheers!

913
01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:17.567
There you go!

914
01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:21.070
-Caitlyn--
-Belinda. I'll get mad at you.

915
01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:22.530
You're doing good.

916
01:02:23.364 --> 01:02:25.241
Let's do away with the glasses.

917
01:02:25.324 --> 01:02:26.492
There!

918
01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:27.952
Bottoms up!

919
01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:29.245
Nice!

920
01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:30.747
Alright.

921
01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:32.582
Chug it. Down it!

922
01:02:32.665 --> 01:02:34.625
Nice!

923
01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:37.670
-You'll be even more lucky. Belinda.
-You wild child.

924
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.049
Yo. yo. Let's party it up!

925
01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.427
Dance with me!

926
01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:54.562
Watch me move. you assholes!

927
01:02:57.523 --> 01:02:58.816
My god. his daughter--

928
01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.070
Come on. let's fuck this up!

929
01:03:05.406 --> 01:03:06.908
So sick!

930
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.412
See? I'm the best--

931
01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:13.372
-I can't believe this woman.
-Come on! Let's go!

932
01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:16.209
Let’s party!

933
01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:18.586
I'm fucking crazy!

934
01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:24.258
Dad. I was just livestreaming.

935
01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:28.846
Some people just screen-recorded it
and made remixes of it.

936
01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:32.558
I don't understand a word you're saying.

937
01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:36.938
but what I know is that you're the one
who did this to your sister!

938
01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:39.816
-OH MY GOD. THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING!
-SHOULD'VE LEFT HER IN THE SQUATTER'S AREA

939
01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:42.860
-JEEZ. THIS WOMAN SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED
-YOU BELONG ON THE FLOOR. GIRL!

940
01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:45.780
-YOUR DRUNK FRIEND WHO KEEP DENYING IT
-WHO THE HELL IS SHE?

941
01:03:45.863 --> 01:03:49.033
Watch me move. you assholes!

942
01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:51.619
HERE'S A ROCK. GOT HIT YOUR HEAD WITH IT

943
01:03:51.702 --> 01:03:53.371
Watch me move--

944
01:04:09.971 --> 01:04:12.265
-Who's there?
-Dickhead!

945
01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:15.393
Hey! Who are you? Who are you?

946
01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:17.520
You're a thief. aren't you?

947
01:04:17.603 --> 01:04:19.814
-Let go of me.
-You stole this watch too. huh?

948
01:04:20.314 --> 01:04:21.732
Hey!

949
01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:23.985
I'm Sir Enrico's daughter.

950
01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:27.029
-I'm running away.
-You're Mr. Enrico Buenavista's daughter?

951
01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:29.448
-You must've lost your mind!
-Shut up! I’m trying to run away.

952
01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.036
I know this.

953
01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:35.580
This is an inside job.

954
01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:38.708
You're the one behind this.
the mastermind.

955
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:41.502
I know suspicious faces
when I see them. I know those looks.

956
01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:44.797
Look! Would you trust…
Would you trust a face like that?

957
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.007
-No. right?
-Yeah. I wouldn't.

958
01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:48.926
-You better pray I don't hurt this guy.
-Are you really challenging me?

959
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.969
I say go for it.

960
01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:51.137
-You got this.
-Go for what?

961
01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.597
I'll beat you up.

962
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:54.765
Hit him!

963
01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:56.934
-Hit him hard!
-Is that all you got. huh?

964
01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:05.776
I don't mind hitting girls.
especially faces like that.

965
01:05:07.194 --> 01:05:08.237
Come here.

966
01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.156
-What now?
-It was just a fist fight.

967
01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.407
Why did you make it personal?

968
01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:12.950
She looks like a bulldog now.

969
01:05:13.784 --> 01:05:14.827
If she…

970
01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:18.247
Oh. they were fighting.

971
01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:20.583
and he made Yaya Mo cry.

972
01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:27.006
Yes. sir. Because he won't believe
that Ma'am Belinda is your daughter.

973
01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:28.257
What?

974
01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:31.802
And here's the real kicker.

975
01:05:32.386 --> 01:05:34.430
he called me ugly.

976
01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:41.896
I'm sorry. sir.

977
01:05:41.979 --> 01:05:44.190
She's wasn’t lying.
And she was going to run away.

978
01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.858
but she told me not to tell you.

979
01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.994
How could you not have known?

980
01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:59.205
I'm sorry. ma'am. I'm the new guard here.

981
01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:16.806
Hey. Daddy? Can we talk?

982
01:06:17.682 --> 01:06:20.851
I'm really sorry for the way
I've been acting

983
01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.979
and the embarrassing things
I've been doing.

984
01:06:23.729 --> 01:06:26.607
Maybe I'm not cut out to be a Buenavista.

985
01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:32.071
What people say about you
is not important.

986
01:06:38.619 --> 01:06:40.997
And what do you think of me now. Dad?

987
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.125
I don't expect you to be perfect. honey.

988
01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:46.794
After all. you're just starting out.

989
01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:52.425
I understand you'll have
your shortcomings and lapses.

990
01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:54.010
But that's okay.

991
01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:56.679
You are my daughter.

992
01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:05.312
So? For now. honey.
it's okay to make mistakes.

993
01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:07.273
or if you do something wrong…

994
01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.152
-I'll take your word for it.
-Yeah. it's part of the job.

995
01:07:11.235 --> 01:07:15.448
Since you said that.
I can mess up again. right?

996
01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:16.741
You can't take back what you just said.

997
01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:21.829
But remember. don't ever break my trust.

998
01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:27.084
I promise. I swear. Cross my heart
and hope to die. I won't break your trust.

999
01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:28.502
-Promise?
-Promise!

1000
01:07:28.586 --> 01:07:30.171
Come. Let's go inside.

1001
01:07:30.254 --> 01:07:31.380
I'm sorry again. Daddy.

1002
01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:32.465
It's okay.

1003
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:43.517
Jacob.

1004
01:07:45.644 --> 01:07:46.687
Ma’am?

1005
01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:55.029
Ma'am. are we really sure about this?

1006
01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:56.947
Maybe there's another way?

1007
01:07:57.698 --> 01:07:59.408
What for? This is the plan.

1008
01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:02.078
I've done my part. Now do yours.

1009
01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:06.624
Just like what we talked about.
if we succeed.

1010
01:08:06.707 --> 01:08:09.585
I will recommend to the board
to promote you to COO.

1011
01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:16.383
Don't you dare
bail out of our plans. or else…

1012
01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:21.180
I. myself. will tell Enrico
you are behind all of it.

1013
01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.855
What's our best-selling dish here?

1014
01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.108
Customers often order the rib-eye steak.

1015
01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.234
How much is that?

1016
01:08:33.317 --> 01:08:34.944
1.200 pesos. ma'am.

1017
01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:37.029
-That's good for how many?
-It's good for one person.

1018
01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:40.241
What? That much for just one?

1019
01:08:40.324 --> 01:08:41.450
-I'll go ahead. sir.
-Okay.

1020
01:08:41.534 --> 01:08:43.452
Mark. how long have you been working here?

1021
01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.204
Three years now. ma'am.

1022
01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.705
How much is your salary?

1023
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:48.749
500 pesos daily.

1024
01:08:48.833 --> 01:08:49.959
Is that right?

1025
01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:57.091
Attorney! Come up here. let's eat.

1026
01:08:57.174 --> 01:08:58.926
There's a dish here worth 1.200!.

1027
01:08:59.009 --> 01:09:00.302
Come on. let's try it.

1028
01:09:01.846 --> 01:09:03.430
Sorry. I have another meeting to get to.

1029
01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.641
What? Hey!

1030
01:09:05.724 --> 01:09:08.060
Hey!

1031
01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:19.613
Do you have a new chef?

1032
01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:22.158
Your pasta tasted a little bland.

1033
01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:24.535
Get as much as you want. This is my treat.

1034
01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:26.912
Help yourselves. I got you guys.

1035
01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.956
You look so pale. get some more.

1036
01:09:29.039 --> 01:09:31.000
Ma'am. isn't that your sister over there?

1037
01:09:36.088 --> 01:09:37.089
Sis!

1038
01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:38.340
Sis!

1039
01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:41.260
Caitlyn. want some fishballs?

1040
01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:43.762
Invite your friends here.
Let's eat. Come on.

1041
01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:47.057
Why is she with those tramps?

1042
01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:49.101
Tramps?

1043
01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.437
You know. those peasants.

1044
01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:58.694
She's probably still full. Yeah.

1045
01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:01.488
-Let’s go.
-Finally.

1046
01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:03.949
My gosh. what took you so long?

1047
01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:07.786
Until the next time.

1048
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:08.954
Yeah. no problem.

1049
01:10:16.795 --> 01:10:19.048
Let's continue this later.

1050
01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:20.466
-Okay. ma’am.
-Thank you.

1051
01:10:22.801 --> 01:10:23.761
Attorney.

1052
01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:27.306
Kindly sign these documents now.

1053
01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:33.187
Attorney. what's the status of my request

1054
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:34.939
to raise the salaries of the waiters?

1055
01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:36.440
Has that been approved?

1056
01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:40.319
The papers are with HR for evaluation.

1057
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.866
Thanks.

1058
01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:47.993
Attorney.

1059
01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.038
Jacob. is there something wrong?

1060
01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:52.998
What?

1061
01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:58.254
I’ve noticed that
you’ve been avoiding me lately.

1062
01:10:58.337 --> 01:11:01.966
There's just a lot of work I have to
finish for Sir Enrico and Ma'am Matilda.

1063
01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:03.050
Okay.

1064
01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:04.385
Let's go out. then.

1065
01:11:04.468 --> 01:11:05.386
What?

1066
01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:07.012
On a date. My treat.

1067
01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:10.224
If it weren't for you.
I wouldn't be able to do all this.

1068
01:11:10.307 --> 01:11:13.269
Since you were so patient with me
and you helped me.

1069
01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:14.728
let’s go out on a date.

1070
01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:15.813
Don't worry about it.

1071
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.275
You don't have to thank me.

1072
01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:22.820
So are we going out?

1073
01:11:22.903 --> 01:11:24.154
Maybe next time.

1074
01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:21.670
Here you go. Something to cheer you up.

1075
01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.672
What's been bothering you lately?

1076
01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:25.382
Here's your noodles!

1077
01:12:25.966 --> 01:12:27.092
Thank you.

1078
01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:30.346
I just miss Attorney.

1079
01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:34.058
He seems to be avoiding me lately.

1080
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:37.478
Maybe he's starting
to have feelings for me.

1081
01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:41.857
Maybe I should be the one to confess?

1082
01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:47.529
Oh. my god. Is this how women act today?

1083
01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:49.281
You should play hard to get

1084
01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:53.160
because someone
who's easy to get is easy to forget.

1085
01:12:53.243 --> 01:12:56.413
Then how do you explain
"Intercourse Fasting"?

1086
01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:58.624
Look at me now. already forgotten.

1087
01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:07.132
That's how you eat noodles?
You look stupid.

1088
01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:09.927
Caitlyn?

1089
01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:11.887
Caitlyn!

1090
01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.347
What happened?

1091
01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:22.147
Where is he? Where's that pervert?

1092
01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.690
Belinda. never mind.

1093
01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:25.401
-Let's just go home.
-There's the pig…

1094
01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:27.069
-With his tongue out!
-No!

1095
01:13:27.152 --> 01:13:29.196
-Hey! You fucking asshole!
-Belinda!

1096
01:13:29.279 --> 01:13:30.656
Why did you do that to my sister?

1097
01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:33.283
-Why are you harassing her?
-Belinda. stop it!

1098
01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:34.952
-You look like a freaking lizard!
-Please!

1099
01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:36.412
I'll beat you up. you bastard!

1100
01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:38.997
Where I'm from.
we won't let these things pass.

1101
01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:41.875
Just take a look at yourself.
You piece of shit.

1102
01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:43.127
Belinda!

1103
01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.338
You're not Bret?

1104
01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:47.673
I'm Maton.

1105
01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:50.300
Why aren't you wearing a name tag?

1106
01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:52.010
And you're eating fries?

1107
01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:53.720
I'm sorry.

1108
01:14:11.738 --> 01:14:13.240
Let's go. Sis. I'm done.

1109
01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.079
My gosh. are you okay?

1110
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.878
I have so many things to do on a weekend.

1111
01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:28.172
Actually. Attorney. there is no emergency.

1112
01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:29.423
This is the emergency.

1113
01:14:29.923 --> 01:14:31.925
No emergency? What's this?

1114
01:14:32.759 --> 01:14:35.804
Something happened to Caitlyn recently.

1115
01:14:36.346 --> 01:14:40.350
Then I realized that. if you do not
stand up for what you want.

1116
01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:43.812
then people won't know
how you really feel.

1117
01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:50.652
Jacob.

1118
01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:52.404
can you please stop avoiding me?

1119
01:14:53.113 --> 01:14:55.449
Just one more date. please?

1120
01:14:55.949 --> 01:14:58.994
Belinda. this is not the time
to talk about our--

1121
01:14:59.077 --> 01:14:59.995
Ouch!

1122
01:15:02.539 --> 01:15:04.541
-Why did you do that?
-Why?

1123
01:15:06.543 --> 01:15:08.212
Belinda. I'm not playing--

1124
01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:09.421
What's wrong?

1125
01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:12.299
Stop that! You're just playing around.

1126
01:15:12.799 --> 01:15:14.927
-Can you catch me?
-You really want to find out. huh?

1127
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.178
If that's what you want.

1128
01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:20.682
You think you can get away that easily?

1129
01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:21.808
Are you ready?

1130
01:15:40.285 --> 01:15:43.038
I still have another one left.

1131
01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:49.962
Sorry.

1132
01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:53.006
It's in my ears!

1133
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:00.681
Belinda.

1134
01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.778
Do you love me too?

1135
01:16:35.382 --> 01:16:36.425
I'm wet.

1136
01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:40.804
Me too.

1137
01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:52.316
We've reviewed your request
to increase the pay for our waiters.

1138
01:16:52.399 --> 01:16:53.900
It looks feasible.

1139
01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:55.736
-We just have to make a proposal--
-No. dear!

1140
01:16:56.236 --> 01:16:59.656
Even me. I was shocked
to learn about the irregularities.

1141
01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:34.274
What is going on. Daddy?

1142
01:17:35.108 --> 01:17:37.194
And you're back from your trip so soon?

1143
01:17:37.277 --> 01:17:40.238
I hate to do this
because you are my daughter.

1144
01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:50.040
I don't understand. What are you saying?

1145
01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:53.085
Why is my company missing
a large amount of money?

1146
01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:54.670
Money?

1147
01:17:56.797 --> 01:17:58.340
I don't know.

1148
01:17:58.423 --> 01:18:00.759
If this is about the increase
of the waiters' salaries--

1149
01:18:04.304 --> 01:18:08.809
If you needed money.
why don't you just ask me?

1150
01:18:09.559 --> 01:18:11.937
Why do you have to steal from my company?

1151
01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.105
Steal?

1152
01:18:22.072 --> 01:18:25.325
I swear that's fake news!

1153
01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:27.911
There are no ghosts here.
so how could there be ghost employees?

1154
01:18:53.478 --> 01:18:57.524
I didn't do anything. Daddy.
I promise. I'm telling the truth.

1155
01:18:57.607 --> 01:19:00.485
You can search all you want.
I swear I can't do anything like that.

1156
01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.195
I did not steal from you.

1157
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:23.341
Jacob. how did Enrico find out

1158
01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:26.094
about our plan for me to get
30 million pesos a month?

1159
01:19:26.678 --> 01:19:30.682
Good thing he didn't accuse me
because I quickly reacted to it.

1160
01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.938
This is the only way
I can get money from Enrico.

1161
01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:38.106
Ma’am.

1162
01:19:39.232 --> 01:19:41.568
I did everything you asked me to do.

1163
01:19:41.651 --> 01:19:44.863
I trained Belinda so that
she could be framed for all of this.

1164
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:47.032
Isn't that enough?

1165
01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:49.075
It's not. It's not enough.

1166
01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:51.661
Do everything you have to do.

1167
01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:02.047
Belinda?

1168
01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:04.466
Belinda?

1169
01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:08.386
Belinda. how are you?

1170
01:20:09.262 --> 01:20:10.472
What did your dad say?

1171
01:20:11.097 --> 01:20:12.390
Belinda…

1172
01:20:20.565 --> 01:20:22.025
Can I give you a ride?

1173
01:20:32.702 --> 01:20:33.912
No. thank you.

1174
01:21:01.481 --> 01:21:03.692
This is what I hate the most. Daddy.

1175
01:21:05.902 --> 01:21:08.029
To see you disappointed.

1176
01:21:11.074 --> 01:21:13.326
I have waited for a long time
to be with you.

1177
01:21:14.494 --> 01:21:17.539
Which is why I could never do that to you.

1178
01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:22.961
I am not a thief.

1179
01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:29.217
I don't need any of this.

1180
01:21:29.801 --> 01:21:32.178
I don't need any of these material things.

1181
01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:37.058
I just need you.

1182
01:21:38.184 --> 01:21:40.937
I need your love and affection.

1183
01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:44.316
I need your acceptance.

1184
01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:53.742
I'm sorry.

1185
01:21:55.535 --> 01:21:57.579
Please believe me.

1186
01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:16.116
Sis!

1187
01:23:19.202 --> 01:23:20.078
Sis…

1188
01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:23.498
I will miss… I will miss you.

1189
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:26.710
Sis…

1190
01:23:32.757 --> 01:23:33.675
Sis…

1191
01:23:44.644 --> 01:23:45.603
Belinda…

1192
01:23:46.896 --> 01:23:50.483
Belinda…

1193
01:23:51.151 --> 01:23:55.321
Belinda. don't leave.

1194
01:23:59.951 --> 01:24:01.995
Yaya. we can still contact each other.

1195
01:24:02.078 --> 01:24:03.621
You have my number.

1196
01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:08.043
Why leave now. Belinda?
Just when we were getting close.

1197
01:24:10.503 --> 01:24:12.672
I will just contact you. I have to go.

1198
01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:22.265
I want us to be together!

1199
01:24:22.348 --> 01:24:24.559
If you really want that.
Yaya. come with me.

1200
01:24:24.642 --> 01:24:26.144
Leave your job.

1201
01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.604
Let's go to Nalapok together.

1202
01:24:27.687 --> 01:24:29.981
We'll sell whatever we catch
in the market.

1203
01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:33.568
The profit's small.
but I know we'll be happy. Come on.

1204
01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:37.906
I realized I still have a lot of debt.

1205
01:24:37.989 --> 01:24:40.200
You go ahead.
You can take care of yourself. right?

1206
01:24:40.283 --> 01:24:41.576
Just go straight.

1207
01:24:42.118 --> 01:24:44.496
Don't worry. the guard knows you already.

1208
01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:49.250
Okay. go. Straight ahead.

1209
01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:52.337
But you said you wanted to be together…

1210
01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.463
I said straight ahead.

1211
01:24:53.546 --> 01:24:55.298
Down that road.

1212
01:24:55.381 --> 01:24:57.133
Watch your step.

1213
01:24:57.217 --> 01:24:58.760
-Take care of yourself.
-Okay.

1214
01:24:58.843 --> 01:24:59.761
Hey!

1215
01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:02.680
Take care. I'm just a text away.

1216
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.111
Belay!

1217
01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:19.280
-Oh my fucking god! This bitch classed up.
-Belay! Take a shot with us!

1218
01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:22.325
-Beautiful!
-You asshole! All you do is drink!

1219
01:25:22.408 --> 01:25:24.911
Belay! You're back!

1220
01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.413
Belay! Join us out here later. okay?

1221
01:25:27.497 --> 01:25:29.332
We'll play cards later. okay?

1222
01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:30.792
You're just fucking around.

1223
01:25:30.875 --> 01:25:31.709
This is too early!

1224
01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:35.088
Hey. Belay! You look like a celebrity now!

1225
01:25:35.171 --> 01:25:37.090
Yo. Chai. don't jack off to Belay!

1226
01:25:37.173 --> 01:25:39.634
Oh. but I miss those damn pussies.

1227
01:25:39.717 --> 01:25:41.302
You're jacking off?

1228
01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:42.512
Hell yeah.

1229
01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:44.139
Like this.

1230
01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:47.851
Jacking off?

1231
01:25:56.526 --> 01:25:59.571
-Uncle? Kim?
-The heat is killing me!

1232
01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:02.866
Belay! You bitch! When did you come back?

1233
01:26:02.949 --> 01:26:04.284
I just got here.

1234
01:26:04.367 --> 01:26:06.578
Fuck! We could have picked you up
if you told us.

1235
01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:08.621
Uncle. hurry up!

1236
01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:11.124
So annoying. just pull!

1237
01:26:11.207 --> 01:26:15.170
Belay. I never thought
you'd come back here.

1238
01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:17.505
-What took you so long?
-You bitch!

1239
01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:20.425
-I missed you guys. I missed Nalapok.
-We missed you too.

1240
01:26:20.508 --> 01:26:25.430
What's with all this drama?
Is that how rich people act?

1241
01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:27.849
Hey. Spongebob. stop ruining the moment.

1242
01:26:27.932 --> 01:26:30.351
Nothing changed except for my armpits.
They're flawless now.

1243
01:26:30.435 --> 01:26:32.353
That can't be for sure.
I'm sure you still stink.

1244
01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:33.813
Let me take a whiff.

1245
01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:35.440
See. it still smells.

1246
01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:37.525
And you guys
haven't showered since I left.

1247
01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:40.987
Jeez. so it's a tie now.
we're all tied. okay?

1248
01:27:22.987 --> 01:27:26.866
I know I could lose my license
for what I'm about to say.

1249
01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:35.458
But I think you need to know the truth.

1250
01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:43.299
Belinda did not steal the money.

1251
01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:55.103
What I want to know is.
why you agreed to Matilda's plan.

1252
01:28:09.033 --> 01:28:13.079
It fucking hurt when they plucked it out.

1253
01:28:13.162 --> 01:28:16.165
Gosh! But you've got to admit.

1254
01:28:16.249 --> 01:28:18.126
-Belay!
-your pussy looked like this before.

1255
01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:20.003
Belay!

1256
01:28:20.086 --> 01:28:20.962
Uncle?

1257
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:23.298
Someone wants to talk to you.

1258
01:28:26.759 --> 01:28:30.305
Fuck. isn't that your wicked stepmother?

1259
01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:31.973
Her face looks like shit.

1260
01:28:32.056 --> 01:28:33.641
Do you want me to beat her to a pulp?

1261
01:28:36.436 --> 01:28:40.523
Just say the word. I got you.

1262
01:28:40.606 --> 01:28:41.649
Ready?

1263
01:28:45.528 --> 01:28:48.197
I'm sorry if I misjudged you.

1264
01:28:49.365 --> 01:28:54.662
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
that you were being used already.

1265
01:28:55.246 --> 01:28:57.332
That's all okay. Dad.

1266
01:28:58.082 --> 01:29:02.962
It's enough for me to know
that you believe me now.

1267
01:29:03.046 --> 01:29:05.840
They're filing an arrest warrant
for Matilda.

1268
01:29:05.923 --> 01:29:06.966
And…

1269
01:29:08.259 --> 01:29:09.886
we're also getting an annulment.

1270
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.472
Why would Aunt Matilda
do something like that?

1271
01:29:24.776 --> 01:29:28.780
When she found out I had
a daughter before we got married.

1272
01:29:29.489 --> 01:29:31.032
she initiated the search for you.

1273
01:29:33.117 --> 01:29:34.369
What will happen to Caitlyn?

1274
01:29:39.123 --> 01:29:42.543
Dear. please come back to me.

1275
01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:47.507
If you don't feel like working
in the company. it's okay.

1276
01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:01.854
At first. all I really wanted was…

1277
01:30:02.605 --> 01:30:04.315
for you to accept me as your daughter.

1278
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:07.026
That's why I changed my ways

1279
01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:09.987
to be the daughter you want me to be.

1280
01:30:11.114 --> 01:30:16.327
But I realized. I should work hard first.

1281
01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:22.166
because I felt like
I didn't deserve to have everything

1282
01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.459
instantly.

1283
01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:26.045
So if it's okay with you.

1284
01:30:28.047 --> 01:30:30.424
I'd like to stay here
while I finish my studies.

1285
01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:35.179
When I'm done. I promise
I'll apply for a job at your hotel.

1286
01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:38.141
I really want to go through the process.

1287
01:30:40.726 --> 01:30:41.978
If that's what you want.

1288
01:30:43.062 --> 01:30:44.188
I respect that.

1289
01:31:04.834 --> 01:31:05.960
Belinda…

1290
01:31:06.544 --> 01:31:07.670
Belinda…

1291
01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:09.881
Belinda…

1292
01:31:17.096 --> 01:31:20.808
I told you I could help you.

1293
01:31:23.769 --> 01:31:25.229
Why are you here?

1294
01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:26.647
You brought him here. didn't you?

1295
01:31:28.191 --> 01:31:29.817
You know what. you got this.

1296
01:31:29.901 --> 01:31:31.777
She can get violent. I got to go.

1297
01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:34.030
Tell me. Why? Why are you here?

1298
01:31:34.113 --> 01:31:35.698
-Wait!
-You asshole!

1299
01:31:35.781 --> 01:31:37.200
-Let me ex--
-Get out of here!

1300
01:31:37.283 --> 01:31:38.284
-Let me explain!
-I heard everything.

1301
01:31:38.367 --> 01:31:40.912
I heard everything
that you and Aunt Matilda said.

1302
01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:42.580
-Just hear me out.
-You don't need to explain.

1303
01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:44.207
Just go back to my dad's office.

1304
01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:45.499
Because I don't want
anything to do with you.

1305
01:31:45.583 --> 01:31:46.834
-I'm here--
-You used me!

1306
01:31:46.918 --> 01:31:48.252
You and Aunt Matilda used me!

1307
01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:54.091
What? Why? But wasn't that your dream?

1308
01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:55.718
What will happen to your future now?

1309
01:31:55.801 --> 01:31:56.761
Belinda.

1310
01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.930
you are my future.

1311
01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:01.557
You are my dream.

1312
01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.563
Bullshit! You're using me!

1313
01:32:07.647 --> 01:32:08.856
You played with my feelings!

1314
01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:11.400
I heard it loud and clear
that you tricked me!

1315
01:32:11.484 --> 01:32:12.818
Can you please…

1316
01:32:12.902 --> 01:32:13.903
Just leave me alone.

1317
01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:16.072
Belinda…

1318
01:32:16.155 --> 01:32:18.157
I don't want to see you.
Not even your shadow.

1319
01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:21.452
-Please?
-I get hurt every time. Don't touch me!

1320
01:32:21.535 --> 01:32:23.287
Please. I'm begging you.

1321
01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:24.705
I was used!

1322
01:32:25.623 --> 01:32:27.208
Get lost!

1323
01:32:27.291 --> 01:32:30.169
Uncle. make it stop. please!

1324
01:32:30.253 --> 01:32:33.756
Just leave me alone. Get out!

1325
01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:36.884
Let me be!

1326
01:32:36.968 --> 01:32:38.261
Belay…

1327
01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:39.929
Ouch!

1328
01:32:42.014 --> 01:32:43.808
Jacob? Where's Jacob?

1329
01:32:44.308 --> 01:32:46.936
Now. you go after him. you drama queen.

1330
01:32:47.019 --> 01:32:48.854
Why didn't you stop him?

1331
01:32:48.938 --> 01:32:50.022
Chase him!

1332
01:32:50.106 --> 01:32:51.857
Fuck this guy.

1333
01:32:52.483 --> 01:32:55.319
I never knew you resigned!

1334
01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:57.822
What you did to me was really hurtful.

1335
01:32:57.905 --> 01:33:02.785
Besides. Yaya Mo knows this.
I really get violent when I wake up.

1336
01:33:03.786 --> 01:33:05.246
Jacob!

1337
01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:09.292
Stop playing hard to get. Jacob!

1338
01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:11.168
Oh. come on.

1339
01:33:12.878 --> 01:33:16.340
Jacob. if you don't turn around.
it means you're a fuck boy.

1340
01:33:30.521 --> 01:33:32.982
Belinda. I already told you
that I love you.

1341
01:33:33.065 --> 01:33:34.900
But you don't want to believe me.

1342
01:33:34.984 --> 01:33:36.986
And then you accuse me
of playing hard to get.

1343
01:33:38.738 --> 01:33:40.573
"And then you accuse me
of playing hard to get."

1344
01:33:42.366 --> 01:33:43.284
Belinda.

1345
01:33:45.828 --> 01:33:46.829
I love you.

1346
01:33:48.205 --> 01:33:49.290
And I accept you.

1347
01:33:50.499 --> 01:33:51.709
Belay.

1348
01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:56.839
I love you too. Jacob.

1349
01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:03.012
-Give us a big kiss. come on!
-Give us a big kiss. come on!

1350
01:34:03.095 --> 01:34:06.015
-Give us a big kiss. come on!
-Give us a big kiss. come on!

1351
01:34:06.098 --> 01:34:09.977
-Give us a big kiss. come on!
-Give us a big kiss. come on!

1352
01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:13.481
Just a little kiss for now. okay?

1353
01:34:13.564 --> 01:34:15.399
Take it easy.

1354
01:34:17.401 --> 01:34:18.694
Kiss.

1355
01:34:19.737 --> 01:34:20.696
Kiss?

1356
01:34:32.083 --> 01:34:37.880
-Dry hump! Dry hump!
-Dry hump! Dry hump!

1357
01:34:55.564 --> 01:34:57.400
Hump her brains out!

1358
01:34:57.483 --> 01:35:00.236
This guy will need a wheelchair tomorrow!
