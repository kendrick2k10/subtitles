00:00:49.353 --> 00:00:50.702
Double shot latte
with oat milk and agave.

4
00:00:50.876 --> 00:00:53.096
It's on me. In honor
of your promotion.

5
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.924
It's not even certain yet.

6
00:00:55.098 --> 00:00:57.013
Oh please. you're the best thing
about this place.

7
00:00:57.187 --> 00:00:58.449
Besides. we both know
what you're like

8
00:00:58.623 --> 00:00:59.798
before your second
morning coffee.

9
00:00:59.972 --> 00:01:00.756
Mm.

10
00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.063
Thanks. Sammie.

11
00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:15.510
Special delivery.

12
00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:17.120
Good morning. Tam.

13
00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:18.817
Is that the offer?

14
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:20.341
Yes.

15
00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:24.867
I just don't know. Tam.

16
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:26.086
Oh. that's ok.

17
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.522
You don't have to decide now.

18
00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:29.350
But let me just tell you
what I know.

19
00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:31.917
This is everything you've asked
for and then some.

20
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.181
This deal honors everywhere
you've been

21
00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:36.313
while providing growth
capital for all the places
you want to go.

22
00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:40.796
How does Chloe feel about it?

23
00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:43.929
Well. she's excited for me.

24
00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.714
She says I should do it.

25
00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:50.066
When my daughter was little.

26
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.548
her first bike had a basket
in front

27
00:01:53.722 --> 00:01:56.420
and she spent the better
part of a year

28
00:01:56.594 --> 00:02:01.382
delivering bobbles and bits
to our neighbors.

29
00:02:01.556 --> 00:02:05.255
The joy she brought
with her deliveries

30
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.867
was the inspiration
for Chloe's Couriers.

31
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:12.088
And she was my
first employee.

32
00:02:12.262 --> 00:02:14.221
She's a dentist now.
go figure.

33
00:02:17.093 --> 00:02:19.182
She must be really proud
of you.

34
00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:21.967
You worked hard for this.

35
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.144
If you need more time
to think it over...

36
00:02:24.318 --> 00:02:25.971
No.

37
00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.973
That won't be necessary.

38
00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.888
I'm ready to sign.

39
00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:31.368
It's a good deal.

40
00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:33.892
A great deal.

41
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:35.155
Thank you.

42
00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.113
My pleasure.

43
00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:44.512
Thank you. Mr. Silva.

44
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.778
This came for you.

45
00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:51.083
It's not every day you get a
brown paper package

46
00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:52.650
tied with string.

47
00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:54.522
It's from Mom and Dad.

48
00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:56.437
You're never too old
for a little goodie box. right?

49
00:03:01.093 --> 00:03:02.225
Anything else?

50
00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:04.401
Amelia wants you
in her office.

51
00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:06.360
Pronto.

52
00:03:06.534 --> 00:03:08.797
Don't worry. she makes
a cappuccino nervous.

53
00:03:08.971 --> 00:03:10.364
I'm not nervous.

54
00:03:18.023 --> 00:03:19.634
Oh. You wanted to see me?

55
00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:21.549
Yes. please. sit.

56
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.466
What's in the box?

57
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.728
Oh?

58
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.607
Uh. they...
they've gone bad.

59
00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:38.609
Oh. no. no. no.

60
00:03:38.783 --> 00:03:40.002
These were picked last night
and shipped overnight delivery

61
00:03:40.176 --> 00:03:41.960
by my parents.

62
00:03:42.134 --> 00:03:44.136
They're Knobbed Russets. they're
supposed to look like that.

63
00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:46.965
Go ahead.

64
00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.663
Try one.

65
00:03:53.363 --> 00:03:56.975
Well. I... I think this may be
the ugliest apple

66
00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:58.107
I've. I've ever seen.

67
00:03:58.281 --> 00:03:59.804
Yes.

68
00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:05.941
And the sweetest one
I've ever tasted.

69
00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:07.203
They're an heirloom variety.

70
00:04:07.377 --> 00:04:10.206
Haye's family orchard specialty.

71
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.121
Um. how did it go with Silva?

72
00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:13.601
Oh.

73
00:04:17.126 --> 00:04:19.084
Oh. yesterday he was out
the door. and today...

74
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.565
Signed. sealed. delivered.
He's in.

75
00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.393
I'm not surprised.

76
00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:25.352
You have the magic touch.

77
00:04:25.526 --> 00:04:28.485
And soon you'll get a chance
to prove it to the Board.

78
00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:30.835
You mean?

79
00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.576
Mm-hm.

80
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.012
They've set a date for
the next pitch meeting.

81
00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:35.623
You have two weeks.

82
00:04:35.797 --> 00:04:37.102
That's great. I have
the perfect company.

83
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.278
No. not a company.

84
00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:39.366
You.

85
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.932
Sorry. what?

86
00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:42.194
You're not pitching
an acquisition.

87
00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:44.196
you are pitching yourself.

88
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:46.895
They want to know what you'll
bring to the company as partner.

89
00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:48.897
Are. are you ok?

90
00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:55.599
Yes. yes. it's just.
companies I can do. but...

91
00:04:55.773 --> 00:04:57.906
Talking about myself it's.
it's not really my thing.

92
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.995
I'll let you in on
a little secret. ok?

93
00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.084
You need to find
three adjectives.

94
00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:04.913
three little words
to describe yourself.

95
00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:07.524
It's basic marketing. really.

96
00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:08.569
Ok. sure.

97
00:05:08.743 --> 00:05:10.266
Mm-hm.

98
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.574
It's um. organized.
punctual. reliable.

99
00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:14.749
Uninspiring.

100
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.058
Look. you need to dive in deep
and find a you-ness

101
00:05:20.232 --> 00:05:23.410
that makes you. you.

102
00:05:23.584 --> 00:05:26.282
Find that spark. the seed.

103
00:05:30.112 --> 00:05:31.461
You need to go home.

104
00:05:31.635 --> 00:05:32.419
Home?

105
00:05:32.593 --> 00:05:33.289
No. I can't.

106
00:05:33.463 --> 00:05:34.116
Yes. you can.

107
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.031
Yes. I can.

108
00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:37.685
You have two weeks to find
the best words you can think of.

109
00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:40.427
And remember. the Board likes
people who are

110
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:42.994
real. vulnerable and raw.

111
00:05:43.168 --> 00:05:44.431
And also perfect.

112
00:05:44.605 --> 00:05:47.434
So. perfectly imperfect.

113
00:05:47.608 --> 00:05:49.000
Exactly.

114
00:05:49.174 --> 00:05:51.089
Ok. Well. thank you.

115
00:05:51.263 --> 00:05:56.965
And Tam. I'm your biggest fan
and I support you 100 percent.

116
00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.839
So. don't mess it up. okay?

117
00:06:02.013 --> 00:06:03.928
Thank you.

118
00:06:04.102 --> 00:06:06.148
You can have the rest of these.

119
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:10.152
How did it go?

120
00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:11.849
Great.

121
00:06:12.023 --> 00:06:14.156
Fantastic. amazing.

122
00:06:21.163 --> 00:06:23.383
Ok. let's call Mom.

123
00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:01.856
Hi. Mom.

124
00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:35.716
Quiet. peaceful. charming.

125
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:06.224
Can I help you?

126
00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.968
What? Is it Tamara Hayes?

127
00:08:11.142 --> 00:08:12.579
Grant. hi.

128
00:08:14.406 --> 00:08:16.234
Now. ladies and gentlemen.
you're in luck.

129
00:08:16.408 --> 00:08:18.149
In front of us we have
a real city slicker.

130
00:08:18.323 --> 00:08:21.501
Who. rumor has it once made
a Goldman Sachs himself cry.

131
00:08:21.675 --> 00:08:25.069
Well. Goldman Sachs
isn't actually a person.

132
00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:28.856
It's two people.
Goldman and Sachs.

133
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.901
Neither of whom I made cry.

134
00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:32.337
Really?

135
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.121
Learn something new
every day.

136
00:08:33.295 --> 00:08:34.165
Right. Even?

137
00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:36.080
Yeah. I suppose so.

138
00:08:40.607 --> 00:08:42.130
What are you doing here?

139
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.046
What are you doing here?

140
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.136
Your parents leased us
a few acres.

141
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.312
How long's that been going on?

142
00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:53.489
About six months.

143
00:08:53.663 --> 00:08:56.884
That's funny. they never
mentioned it.

144
00:08:57.058 --> 00:08:59.103
I see you brought
your fan club.

145
00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:01.105
Yeah. kind of.

146
00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.804
Grant and I are teaching a
sustainable agriculture class.

147
00:09:03.978 --> 00:09:05.632
You're teaching?

148
00:09:05.806 --> 00:09:07.198
You've been talking about that
since we were kids.

149
00:09:07.372 --> 00:09:08.809
Yeah.

150
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:09.897
You look good.

151
00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:11.899
You look so different.

152
00:09:12.073 --> 00:09:12.856
Oh?

153
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.814
I mean. older.

154
00:09:13.988 --> 00:09:14.989
Oh.

155
00:09:15.163 --> 00:09:17.165
I mean. like in a good way.

156
00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:18.645
Grown up.

157
00:09:20.647 --> 00:09:22.387
What's the occasion?

158
00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.389
I'm up for partner at the firm.

159
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.044
Ah. that doesn't surprise me.

160
00:09:27.218 --> 00:09:28.219
Here to celebrate?

161
00:09:28.393 --> 00:09:30.004
Oh. no. I've been sent home.

162
00:09:30.178 --> 00:09:31.919
You say that like you've been
sent to your room.

163
00:09:32.093 --> 00:09:34.486
I have to prepare a presentation
about myself for the Board.

164
00:09:34.661 --> 00:09:37.141
I get three adjectives
to describe myself.

165
00:09:37.315 --> 00:09:38.882
Three?

166
00:09:39.056 --> 00:09:41.537
I can think of 20 at least.

167
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.847
Well. good luck with that.
It's nice to see you back.

168
00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:50.067
Yeah. well. see you around.

169
00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:55.377
Wait. Um. what might they be?

170
00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:58.206
If you had to describe me
in three words?

171
00:10:01.078 --> 00:10:05.169
Stubborn... as... heck.

172
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.478
I will make note of that.

173
00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:11.393
Happy to help.

174
00:10:14.048 --> 00:10:19.270
Same old town. same old
Lewis brothers.

175
00:10:19.444 --> 00:10:22.056
Did I see sparks?

176
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.145
You might see stars
if you keep it up.

177
00:10:24.319 --> 00:10:25.929
Hey. everyone.
who wants a lesson

178
00:10:26.103 --> 00:10:28.062
in how not to speak to girls?

179
00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:42.642
Oh! She's here!

180
00:10:42.816 --> 00:10:43.947
Mom!

181
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:46.341
-Hi!
-Bring it in here!

182
00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:47.995
So. good to see you.

183
00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:49.997
Oh. I've missed you guys.

184
00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:51.563
Oh. we missed you.

185
00:10:51.738 --> 00:10:53.565
We can't believe you're home.

186
00:10:58.179 --> 00:11:00.137
Oh wow.
Mom this is beautiful.

187
00:11:03.445 --> 00:11:05.447
There's lemon bars and tea.

188
00:11:05.621 --> 00:11:07.492
and for dinner I'm making
your favorite.

189
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.930
Grilled cheese and tomato soup.

190
00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:11.105
Ahh.

191
00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.149
Oh. it's good to have you home.

192
00:11:12.323 --> 00:11:13.716
It's good to be home.

193
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.936
The new build looks amazing.
I love it.

194
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.589
I'm so glad you like it.

195
00:11:17.764 --> 00:11:19.853
It's come a long way
since you saw it last.

196
00:11:20.027 --> 00:11:22.116
And thank goodness it's over.

197
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.858
Our kitchen was in shambles
for months.

198
00:11:25.032 --> 00:11:26.033
Oh!

199
00:11:26.207 --> 00:11:28.296
Ok. well I have a game plan.

200
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.952
The orchard is first and then
Grandma's shed is a must.
obviously.

201
00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:33.954
Huh?

202
00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:35.912
Remember?

203
00:11:36.086 --> 00:11:37.958
To find my essence?

204
00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:40.308
Yes. of course. Your work thing.

205
00:11:40.482 --> 00:11:41.962
Yes. of course.

206
00:11:42.136 --> 00:11:44.051
Dad and I pulled some boxes
from the shed.

207
00:11:44.225 --> 00:11:46.575
So photos. mementos.
old projects

208
00:11:46.749 --> 00:11:48.098
will be in your new room.

209
00:11:48.272 --> 00:11:50.144
Mm-hm.

210
00:11:50.318 --> 00:11:51.145
We're here to help.

211
00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:52.450
Thank you.

212
00:11:53.625 --> 00:11:55.062
Huh?

213
00:11:55.236 --> 00:11:56.019
Construction must have left
that behind.

214
00:11:56.193 --> 00:11:57.194
Oh. yes.

215
00:11:57.368 --> 00:11:59.980
I've been meaning to return it.

216
00:12:00.154 --> 00:12:01.633
Well. you better get started.

217
00:12:01.808 --> 00:12:03.853
Sounds like you have your work
cut out for you.

218
00:12:04.027 --> 00:12:05.159
Hm.

219
00:12:10.642 --> 00:12:12.166
Mom.

220
00:12:17.998 --> 00:12:19.434
You preserved my room.

221
00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:22.176
Well. of course we did.

222
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.570
We couldn't take down
all this magic.

223
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.659
I'll leave you to it.

224
00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:38.235
Some might call me a go-getter.

225
00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:41.195
Others might say overachiever.

226
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.212
Oh!

227
00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:11.007
This feels like a later thing.

228
00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:44.432
I'm never gonna find
my three words.

229
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.814
How's your project coming?

230
00:14:18.988 --> 00:14:20.685
Yeah. it's not.

231
00:14:22.165 --> 00:14:24.820
Think less. Feel more.

232
00:14:26.691 --> 00:14:30.957
I can still remember you
knee-high on a step stool.

233
00:14:31.131 --> 00:14:32.915
Insisting that your Grandma Mary
let you measure

234
00:14:33.089 --> 00:14:36.266
every single cup of sugar
she put in her apple pie.

235
00:14:38.486 --> 00:14:43.012
You've always been a force
to be reckoned with.

236
00:14:43.186 --> 00:14:46.146
Ah. if Mary could see you now.

237
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.930
Thank you. Dad.

238
00:14:48.104 --> 00:14:49.453
I don't know if the Board
is particularly interested

239
00:14:49.627 --> 00:14:51.151
in Grandma's pies.

240
00:14:51.325 --> 00:14:54.502
Why don't you try walking
the orchard once more?

241
00:14:54.676 --> 00:14:56.547
That usually does the trick.

242
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:57.853
Again?

243
00:14:58.027 --> 00:14:59.333
Can't hurt.

244
00:14:59.507 --> 00:15:02.945
Besides. in your journey
to find yourself.

245
00:15:03.119 --> 00:15:07.080
wherever you go.
there you are.

246
00:15:32.192 --> 00:15:33.497
What?

247
00:15:47.685 --> 00:15:48.686
Mom.

248
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.861
Did you find yourself yet?

249
00:15:50.036 --> 00:15:51.428
What is this?

250
00:15:54.736 --> 00:15:58.653
I... I guess we ought
to tell you.

251
00:15:58.827 --> 00:16:00.960
Rappled Apples
is shutting down.

252
00:16:01.134 --> 00:16:03.049
And no other distributor
is willing to buy and sell

253
00:16:03.223 --> 00:16:05.573
heirloom varieties.

254
00:16:05.747 --> 00:16:08.315
The whole town is feeling
the pressure.

255
00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:13.146
Planting new varieties. cutting
down old trees to make room.

256
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.410
You can't cut down
the Knobbed Russets.

257
00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:18.934
Your father and I are in talks
with a new distributor

258
00:16:19.108 --> 00:16:22.111
who's interested
in buying Fujis.

259
00:16:22.285 --> 00:16:23.895
The ones that taste
like cardboard?

260
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.593
They aren't that bad.

261
00:16:25.767 --> 00:16:28.117
You can't find Knobbed Russets
anywhere else.

262
00:16:28.291 --> 00:16:30.598
They're what makes
Hermansville unique.

263
00:16:30.772 --> 00:16:33.470
They're a part of
our family tradition.

264
00:16:33.644 --> 00:16:37.561
We didn't realize you cared
that much about it.

265
00:16:37.735 --> 00:16:39.824
Neither did I.

266
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.957
Well. I... I guess that's
one thing that you're
passionate about.

267
00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:46.440
Apples. Add it to your list.

268
00:16:46.614 --> 00:16:48.529
Tam's the business expert.

269
00:16:48.703 --> 00:16:50.400
Maybe she'll see something
we overlooked.

270
00:16:50.574 --> 00:16:52.272
Tam?

271
00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:55.144
I think she should focus on
one project at a time.

272
00:16:55.318 --> 00:16:57.451
Hello? I am right here.

273
00:16:59.148 --> 00:17:02.499
At any rate. the three of us
will never forget

274
00:17:02.673 --> 00:17:05.807
what Grandma started. and
that's what really matters.

275
00:17:05.981 --> 00:17:07.765
I'll figure it out.

276
00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:09.767
I just need the books.

277
00:17:25.174 --> 00:17:27.133
I've been trying to get
in touch all day.

278
00:17:27.307 --> 00:17:28.308
Oh. yeah. sorry.

279
00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:30.223
The service has been spotty.

280
00:17:30.397 --> 00:17:32.964
Well. Chad Hughes is up against
you for partnership promotion.

281
00:17:33.139 --> 00:17:34.096
Chad Hughes?

282
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.663
He started at JDS after me

283
00:17:35.837 --> 00:17:37.360
and he has never closed
a major deal.

284
00:17:37.534 --> 00:17:39.884
Yes. but Chad's father
plays golf with Bob Kent.

285
00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.973
As in Chairman Bob Kent.

286
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.368
Tam. take your hands off
your face.

287
00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:48.980
Listen. I could have hired a
Harvard MBA with baby blues.

288
00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:50.286
but I chose you instead.

289
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.896
Do you want to know why?

290
00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:52.984
Because you went to Yale?

291
00:17:53.159 --> 00:17:54.943
Yes. but more importantly.

292
00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:57.467
you were the right person
to grow this company.

293
00:17:57.641 --> 00:18:00.818
I know it. you know it and now
the Board needs to know it too.

294
00:18:00.992 --> 00:18:03.821
So. will they know it?

295
00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:05.519
They will know it.

296
00:18:05.693 --> 00:18:07.260
That's what I like to hear.

297
00:18:10.132 --> 00:18:10.959
Jeez!

298
00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:13.004
Even Lewis!

299
00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:15.442
Do we need to start locking
the doors?

300
00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:16.834
Tree medicine.

301
00:18:17.008 --> 00:18:19.054
Got to keep it cold.

302
00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:27.541
Some light reading?

303
00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:29.412
Account ledgers.

304
00:18:29.586 --> 00:18:32.241
Story's a little dry but I am
worried about the ending.

305
00:18:32.415 --> 00:18:35.070
Tamara Hayes tackles
another project?

306
00:18:35.244 --> 00:18:37.377
I can't let them cut down
Grandma's apples.

307
00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:39.553
Ah. the Knobbed Russets.

308
00:18:39.727 --> 00:18:41.859
There's never been
a sweeter apple.

309
00:18:42.033 --> 00:18:44.035
Or an uglier one.

310
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.124
Find anything?

311
00:18:45.298 --> 00:18:47.169
Not yet. but I will.

312
00:18:49.215 --> 00:18:51.913
What about your presentation?

313
00:18:52.087 --> 00:18:54.045
The one you were sent home
to prepare?

314
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.004
Your partnership pitch?

315
00:18:56.178 --> 00:18:57.832
Yes. what about it?

316
00:18:58.006 --> 00:18:59.834
You sure you have time to save
the Knobbed Russets

317
00:19:00.008 --> 00:19:02.228
and discover your true self?

318
00:19:02.402 --> 00:19:04.621
Seems to me like something's
gotta give.

319
00:19:04.795 --> 00:19:07.494
I disagree. I think
there's plenty of time for both.

320
00:19:07.668 --> 00:19:09.800
No offense. Tam.

321
00:19:09.974 --> 00:19:13.543
but you're kind of known
for sticking your fingers
in too many pies.

322
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:16.416
Pie.

323
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.939
Huh?

324
00:19:18.113 --> 00:19:19.462
That's it. That's the way in.

325
00:19:19.636 --> 00:19:20.942
What are you talking about?

326
00:19:21.116 --> 00:19:22.465
We all know our apples
are great.

327
00:19:22.639 --> 00:19:24.206
There's no doubt about it.

328
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.122
But. what we need is a brand.

329
00:19:27.296 --> 00:19:29.864
Ok. so the Knobbed Russets
aren't selling on their own.

330
00:19:30.038 --> 00:19:31.953
But if we make them into pies.
I mean.

331
00:19:32.127 --> 00:19:34.260
who doesn't love apple pie?

332
00:19:34.434 --> 00:19:35.957
Here we go again.

333
00:19:36.131 --> 00:19:37.959
This is exactly what I was
talking about.

334
00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:40.483
Grandma came to the states
with nothing.

335
00:19:40.657 --> 00:19:43.138
Look at what she built.

336
00:19:43.312 --> 00:19:46.141
And now we fight for her legacy.
With pie.

337
00:19:46.315 --> 00:19:47.273
Apple pie.

338
00:19:47.447 --> 00:19:49.231
I just need sugar.

339
00:19:49.405 --> 00:19:50.972
Honestly. I can't believe I
didn't think of this before.

340
00:19:51.146 --> 00:19:53.017
Running this place is harder
than it looks.

341
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.803
A pie isn't just gonna...

342
00:19:55.977 --> 00:19:56.891
That's salt.

343
00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:59.023
Please. I grew up here.

344
00:20:02.462 --> 00:20:03.941
Yeah. but you were a kid.

345
00:20:04.115 --> 00:20:06.117
You didn't pay attention
to orchard management.

346
00:20:06.292 --> 00:20:08.903
I know about cost accounting.
Even.

347
00:20:09.077 --> 00:20:11.297
The orchard is a business.
just like anything else.

348
00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:13.168
Exactly.

349
00:20:13.342 --> 00:20:14.430
So then you know that we could
never make enough pies

350
00:20:14.604 --> 00:20:15.997
to even make a dent.

351
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:17.477
What's going on down here?

352
00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:19.522
Pie. Apple pie.

353
00:20:19.696 --> 00:20:22.351
If we can't sell the product.
then we change the product.

354
00:20:22.525 --> 00:20:24.919
I am gonna save
the Knobbed Russets.

355
00:20:25.093 --> 00:20:26.094
What's all the noise?

356
00:20:26.268 --> 00:20:27.661
Pie.

357
00:20:27.835 --> 00:20:29.358
Don't mind if I do.

358
00:20:29.532 --> 00:20:32.622
I still need sugar.
and where is the flour?

359
00:20:32.796 --> 00:20:33.884
On my shopping list.

360
00:20:34.058 --> 00:20:36.017
That's ok.

361
00:20:36.191 --> 00:20:39.194
I mean. we really just need
Grandma's recipe.

362
00:20:39.368 --> 00:20:40.587
Oh. honey.

363
00:20:40.761 --> 00:20:43.894
She never wrote it down.
It's lost.

364
00:20:44.068 --> 00:20:46.027
Oh.

365
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:48.029
That's all right.
I'll remember it.

366
00:20:48.203 --> 00:20:50.249
I can almost hear her
little song.

367
00:20:53.513 --> 00:20:55.558
Can't we do this
in the morning?

368
00:20:55.732 --> 00:20:59.170
Three words. Lee.
Stubborn... as... heck.

369
00:20:59.345 --> 00:21:00.998
No. I can't sleep now.

370
00:21:01.172 --> 00:21:03.958
Imagine Grandma's apple pies
inside grocery stores

371
00:21:04.132 --> 00:21:05.873
across the country.

372
00:21:06.047 --> 00:21:07.527
Would be something.

373
00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:09.442
It would be everything.

374
00:21:09.616 --> 00:21:12.401
Yeah. but our resources are
stretched so thin already.

375
00:21:12.575 --> 00:21:15.012
I don't see it being possible.

376
00:21:15.186 --> 00:21:17.232
Your father's right.

377
00:21:17.406 --> 00:21:20.975
But. you know better than
to let a challenge

378
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:23.064
stand in the way of a dream.

379
00:21:23.238 --> 00:21:29.157
If you believe in this.
we do too.

380
00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:31.246
We'll find a way.

381
00:21:39.602 --> 00:21:40.386
Morning. hon.

382
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.126
Gotta pick apples!

383
00:21:58.578 --> 00:22:00.231
Hey!

384
00:22:00.406 --> 00:22:01.972
You're eating my prized apple.

385
00:22:02.146 --> 00:22:03.496
Sorry.

386
00:22:04.061 --> 00:22:05.933
How is it?

387
00:22:06.107 --> 00:22:09.371
This is the best Russet
I have ever tasted.

388
00:22:09.545 --> 00:22:10.938
I didn't know they could get
any sweeter.

389
00:22:11.112 --> 00:22:14.158
Honestly and truly.
what is your secret?

390
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:17.074
Well. I always listened
to the experts

391
00:22:17.248 --> 00:22:18.293
and then do the opposite.

392
00:22:18.467 --> 00:22:20.251
Is that so?

393
00:22:20.426 --> 00:22:22.515
Yeah. it's not easy. but if you
ignore good advice long enough.

394
00:22:22.689 --> 00:22:25.431
you'd be surprised how far
you can get.

395
00:22:25.605 --> 00:22:27.520
Is that one of your projects?

396
00:22:27.694 --> 00:22:31.088
Yeah. that tree is sick
and the paste is medicine.

397
00:22:31.262 --> 00:22:32.960
Does it work?

398
00:22:33.134 --> 00:22:35.092
You tell me. you're the one
eating my prized apple.

399
00:22:35.266 --> 00:22:37.138
Incredible.

400
00:22:38.139 --> 00:22:39.967
Usually have the orchard
to myself at this hour.

401
00:22:40.141 --> 00:22:42.186
Grant's more of a sleep
till noon kind of guy.

402
00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:43.840
I didn't sleep a wink.

403
00:22:44.014 --> 00:22:45.755
I was up all night planning.
I feel great.

404
00:22:47.104 --> 00:22:48.976
If you say so.

405
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.630
We need more apples.

406
00:22:53.676 --> 00:22:55.330
Tam.

407
00:22:55.504 --> 00:22:56.157
We'll sell more apples inside
of pies than we ever did

408
00:22:56.331 --> 00:22:57.941
by the bushel.

409
00:22:58.115 --> 00:22:59.552
It's always easier solving
another man's problem.

410
00:22:59.726 --> 00:23:01.989
I get that you're excited.
but you came home

411
00:23:02.163 --> 00:23:06.036
to solve one problem and now
you're picking at another.

412
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.517
What does baking pies have
to do with your pitch?

413
00:23:08.691 --> 00:23:10.301
Maybe everything.

414
00:23:11.346 --> 00:23:13.217
These pies are my family legacy.

415
00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:16.090
Why does JDS want to know
so much about you anyway?

416
00:23:16.264 --> 00:23:18.005
Don't you just buy
and sell companies?

417
00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:19.920
If I make partner.
my creative vision

418
00:23:20.094 --> 00:23:22.009
will influence the company's
direction.

419
00:23:22.183 --> 00:23:23.880
They just want to make sure
I'm the right fit.

420
00:23:24.054 --> 00:23:26.100
Oh. so it's not about
who you are.

421
00:23:26.274 --> 00:23:28.319
it's about who they are.

422
00:23:28.494 --> 00:23:29.843
Like you said.

423
00:23:30.017 --> 00:23:31.497
I came home to solve
a problem

424
00:23:31.671 --> 00:23:32.672
and then I found an equally
important problem

425
00:23:32.846 --> 00:23:34.978
that also needs to be solved.

426
00:23:35.152 --> 00:23:36.502
I can do both.

427
00:23:36.676 --> 00:23:38.591
Fine. But you should know.

428
00:23:38.765 --> 00:23:41.158
we've tried just about
everything to save
these Russets.

429
00:23:41.332 --> 00:23:43.247
It's impossible.

430
00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:45.249
Yeah. you haven't tried pies.

431
00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:46.947
Ah. I see.

432
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:48.862
Well. then who am I to stand
in your way?

433
00:23:49.036 --> 00:23:50.080
Good luck.

434
00:23:50.254 --> 00:23:52.213
Hm. No such thing.

435
00:24:09.143 --> 00:24:10.971
Ugh.

436
00:24:12.059 --> 00:24:14.235
Buy Mom new coffee. contact...

437
00:24:20.067 --> 00:24:20.589
You all right?

438
00:24:20.763 --> 00:24:22.069
Yeah.

439
00:24:26.769 --> 00:24:28.510
So. you're really doing this?

440
00:24:28.684 --> 00:24:31.992
Yes. I'm really doing this.

441
00:24:32.166 --> 00:24:33.863
Then you might need my help
rallying the troops.

442
00:24:34.037 --> 00:24:35.430
No. I don't need your help.

443
00:24:35.604 --> 00:24:36.257
Yeah. you might.

444
00:24:36.431 --> 00:24:37.737
I don't.

445
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:39.042
Besides. you said
this was impossible.

446
00:24:39.216 --> 00:24:41.871
Absolutely. it is impossible.

447
00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:44.265
But. it's for a good cause.

448
00:24:46.572 --> 00:24:48.965
Come on.

449
00:24:49.139 --> 00:24:50.576
Get in the car.

450
00:25:13.163 --> 00:25:14.904
Are you gonna help out or what?

451
00:25:15.078 --> 00:25:15.949
Come on.

452
00:25:16.123 --> 00:25:16.993
You're a child.

453
00:25:17.167 --> 00:25:18.299
Here. Seriously. here.

454
00:25:18.473 --> 00:25:19.996
Come on. Even. get it.

455
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:20.997
Come on. Get it.

456
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:22.129
Come on. man...

457
00:25:39.276 --> 00:25:40.539
Oh.

458
00:25:40.713 --> 00:25:41.975
Maybe aim a little lower
next time.

459
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:43.454
Me? Never.

460
00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:45.152
Right. I forgot who I was
talking to.

461
00:25:45.326 --> 00:25:48.198
Hey. you said so
yourself. Stubborn as heck.

462
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:57.338
Oh. well.

463
00:25:57.512 --> 00:25:59.383
The other side of the street's
looking a bit sparse.

464
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.037
Why don't you focus on that
instead of worrying about what

465
00:26:01.211 --> 00:26:02.822
I'm doing?

466
00:26:02.996 --> 00:26:04.345
Sure thing. boss.

467
00:26:10.177 --> 00:26:11.657
Do you two ever give it a rest?

468
00:26:11.831 --> 00:26:13.223
I mean. I would think
after 30 something years

469
00:26:13.397 --> 00:26:14.355
you would learn to get along.

470
00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:15.835
He started it.

471
00:26:16.009 --> 00:26:18.315
I'm just saying...

472
00:26:18.489 --> 00:26:20.579
And you're not still upset
about prom?

473
00:26:20.753 --> 00:26:21.841
Of course not.

474
00:26:22.015 --> 00:26:23.059
It's like a lifetime ago.

475
00:26:23.233 --> 00:26:24.844
We were practically children.

476
00:26:25.018 --> 00:26:27.020
Well. he still seems to give you
a great deal of trouble.

477
00:26:27.194 --> 00:26:28.630
if you ask me.

478
00:26:28.804 --> 00:26:30.153
Well. luckily no one
is asking you. Mom.

479
00:26:30.327 --> 00:26:31.502
Don't!

480
00:26:33.287 --> 00:26:35.550
I think the two of you
just like arguing.

481
00:26:35.724 --> 00:26:37.073
Get out of here.
Hang your posters.

482
00:26:47.301 --> 00:26:48.345
Mia. surprise!

483
00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:51.044
Wow.

484
00:26:51.218 --> 00:26:53.089
Christmas came early.

485
00:26:53.263 --> 00:26:55.004
Jeez. I can't believe you found
the time to drive down here.

486
00:26:55.178 --> 00:26:56.527
Uh...

487
00:26:56.702 --> 00:26:57.877
It's not the workaholic Tam
I know.

488
00:26:58.051 --> 00:26:59.400
Tell me more.

489
00:26:59.574 --> 00:27:00.444
How would you describe
the Tam you know.

490
00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:02.359
Say in like. three words?

491
00:27:02.533 --> 00:27:03.796
Um.

492
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.406
What should we do
with the extras?

493
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.537
Oh. we can hand them out
to people as they sit.

494
00:27:09.584 --> 00:27:12.413
Don't look at me like that.
He's just helping.

495
00:27:12.587 --> 00:27:14.545
You mean you two
are working together?

496
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.895
Yes.

497
00:27:16.069 --> 00:27:17.418
Uh-huh.

498
00:27:25.078 --> 00:27:26.253
Hey. honey.

499
00:27:26.427 --> 00:27:27.384
You nervous?

500
00:27:27.558 --> 00:27:28.647
No.

501
00:27:30.561 --> 00:27:33.216
Uh. actually yes.

502
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.437
Grandma planted these Russets
with her own hands.

503
00:27:36.611 --> 00:27:38.961
And it's not just her.
every orchard in the country

504
00:27:39.135 --> 00:27:43.096
was started by someone with a
little dream and a lot of grit.

505
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.925
The Knobbed Russets connect
our past with our present.

506
00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:48.579
Mom. we cannot cut them down.

507
00:27:48.754 --> 00:27:50.407
Ok. honey.

508
00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:51.757
Ready?

509
00:27:53.193 --> 00:27:54.281
Mm-hm.

510
00:27:55.151 --> 00:27:58.415
Aim. fire.

511
00:28:07.424 --> 00:28:09.949
Hi. Um. thank you all
for coming.

512
00:28:10.123 --> 00:28:14.475
I really appreciate you
all being here.

513
00:28:14.649 --> 00:28:16.956
Those of you that know me know
that I grew up here.

514
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.828
Haven't been around much
lately. but.

515
00:28:20.002 --> 00:28:22.439
home is home and I'm worried
that our homes are being

516
00:28:22.613 --> 00:28:24.137
taken away from us because
people can't help

517
00:28:24.311 --> 00:28:26.182
but judge an apple by its peel.

518
00:28:26.356 --> 00:28:28.881
My family's Knobbed Russets
were planted by my Grandmother.

519
00:28:29.055 --> 00:28:31.361
And Mrs. Roy. everyone knows
how your Grandfather's

520
00:28:31.535 --> 00:28:34.974
first purchase in America
was a handful of Russet seeds.

521
00:28:35.148 --> 00:28:36.497
That's right. always said

522
00:28:36.671 --> 00:28:38.281
he wished he'd bought
lunch instead.

523
00:28:38.455 --> 00:28:39.239
Less work.

524
00:28:41.328 --> 00:28:43.025
If we uproot the Knobbed
Russets.

525
00:28:43.199 --> 00:28:46.159
we uproot our traditions
and the legacy is lost forever.

526
00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:47.987
Legacies don't pay.

527
00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:50.076
No one buys our ugly
apples anymore.

528
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:53.035
Our apples are ugly. yes.

529
00:28:53.209 --> 00:28:56.996
But they're also delicious
and the solution is simple.

530
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.999
And sweet as pie.

531
00:29:02.044 --> 00:29:03.959
Apple pie.

532
00:29:04.133 --> 00:29:07.049
If we band together to sell pies
made with our families

533
00:29:07.223 --> 00:29:09.530
Knobbed Russets. we have
a fighting chance.

534
00:29:09.704 --> 00:29:11.880
We can establish a brand.
make an impact.

535
00:29:12.054 --> 00:29:14.448
But. only if we work together.

536
00:29:16.232 --> 00:29:17.712
Any questions?

537
00:29:29.158 --> 00:29:30.203
What are you doing?

538
00:29:32.074 --> 00:29:36.905
Look. everyone. I know the pie
idea's unique.

539
00:29:37.079 --> 00:29:39.865
Believe me. I was the first
person to say no way.

540
00:29:40.039 --> 00:29:41.910
I mean. pies? Come on.

541
00:29:42.084 --> 00:29:45.914
But. Tam is the only one here
addressing this problem.

542
00:29:46.088 --> 00:29:47.568
We all have a choice.

543
00:29:47.742 --> 00:29:49.526
We can look the other way

544
00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:54.923
or we can fire up our whisks and
save generations of hard work.

545
00:29:55.097 --> 00:29:58.187
We all know Tam is full of
elaborate ideas.

546
00:29:58.361 --> 00:30:00.189
Excuse me?

547
00:30:00.363 --> 00:30:04.977
But sometimes they really work
and I think this is one of them.

548
00:30:05.151 --> 00:30:07.283
Tam's heart is
in the right place.

549
00:30:07.457 --> 00:30:10.069
It always has been.

550
00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:13.507
So. all we need is a little
sugar. spice

551
00:30:13.681 --> 00:30:16.031
and a whole lot of apples.

552
00:30:16.205 --> 00:30:20.209
Your grandma's apple pie was
always the talk of the town.

553
00:30:20.383 --> 00:30:21.732
I'm in!

554
00:30:23.691 --> 00:30:27.260
Oh. um. sign here? Thank you.

555
00:30:27.434 --> 00:30:29.958
Thank you. Ms. Minnie.

556
00:30:30.132 --> 00:30:32.004
Um. just pass it around.
I guess. Thank you.

557
00:30:32.178 --> 00:30:33.005
Mm-hm.

558
00:30:33.179 --> 00:30:34.658
Me too.

559
00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:36.008
I'm not sure what
you said there.

560
00:30:36.182 --> 00:30:37.052
but thank you.

561
00:30:37.226 --> 00:30:39.098
Will?

562
00:30:50.152 --> 00:30:53.982
Mr. Sluctor. you have more
trees than anybody here.

563
00:30:54.156 --> 00:30:55.984
What do you think?

564
00:30:56.158 --> 00:30:58.204
I think Mary Hayes kept her
secret apple pie recipe

565
00:30:58.378 --> 00:31:01.207
locked up tighter than
her liquor cabinet.

566
00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:03.296
You sure you can recreate it?

567
00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:07.561
Of course she can.

568
00:31:07.735 --> 00:31:11.173
We all know Tam helped Mary
bake those pies.

569
00:31:11.347 --> 00:31:14.176
She measured out the sugar.
cup by cup.

570
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.004
That was a long time ago.

571
00:31:16.178 --> 00:31:20.443
Sure. but some things you never
forget. right Tam?

572
00:31:21.575 --> 00:31:23.055
Right.

573
00:31:23.229 --> 00:31:26.058
Well. that would be something.
all right.

574
00:31:26.232 --> 00:31:29.365
In all my years of judging
apple day's blue ribbon pies.

575
00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:34.283
I still never came across one
that's as good as Mary's.

576
00:31:34.457 --> 00:31:37.199
But. I'm in talks with
a distributor

577
00:31:37.373 --> 00:31:39.158
who wants to buy
Red Delicious.

578
00:31:39.332 --> 00:31:41.116
Mr. Sluctor.

579
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:44.859
When's the last time you ate
and enjoyed a Red Delicious?

580
00:31:45.033 --> 00:31:48.341
Business is business.

581
00:31:48.515 --> 00:31:50.038
We need your help.

582
00:31:53.607 --> 00:31:55.174
I'm sorry.

583
00:31:57.611 --> 00:31:59.482
My answer is no.

584
00:32:08.187 --> 00:32:10.406
Um.

585
00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:14.019
Anyone else?

586
00:32:14.193 --> 00:32:15.934
Oh. great. Thank you.

587
00:32:16.108 --> 00:32:18.023
Thank you.

588
00:32:25.769 --> 00:32:28.337
Nothing comes easy.

589
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.472
Oh.

590
00:32:32.646 --> 00:32:33.864
Congratulations.

591
00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:35.388
Thank you.

592
00:32:39.783 --> 00:32:41.394
That's delicious.

593
00:32:41.568 --> 00:32:44.223
Thanks for your vote
of confidence today too.

594
00:32:44.397 --> 00:32:46.007
Your support means a lot.

595
00:32:46.181 --> 00:32:48.140
And not just to me.
to everyone else. too.

596
00:32:48.314 --> 00:32:52.013
Tam. you know I'll always have
your back. no matter what.

597
00:32:52.187 --> 00:32:55.060
But this really needs to work.
A lot of people signed up.

598
00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:57.105
It will work. you said
so yourself.

599
00:32:57.279 --> 00:33:02.284
I believe in you. it's just. a
lot of people are taking a risk.

600
00:33:02.458 --> 00:33:05.244
This valley was built with a few
dollars and not much sense

601
00:33:05.418 --> 00:33:07.942
by people willing to bet
on themselves.

602
00:33:08.116 --> 00:33:09.944
True.

603
00:33:10.118 --> 00:33:14.905
But. these day's it's a lot
harder to get a second chance.

604
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.690
What are you saying?

605
00:33:19.258 --> 00:33:20.824
If this fails...

606
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:21.869
It won't fail.

607
00:33:22.043 --> 00:33:24.002
Tam.

608
00:33:24.176 --> 00:33:25.612
You don't know that.

609
00:33:27.396 --> 00:33:29.137
You're right. I don't.

610
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.140
But I do know
that fear of failure

611
00:33:32.314 --> 00:33:35.274
is the biggest obstacle
to success.

612
00:33:35.448 --> 00:33:37.406
I'm just worried we got
their hopes up.

613
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.408
That I got their hopes up.

614
00:33:39.582 --> 00:33:41.149
Well. I believe this will work.

615
00:33:41.323 --> 00:33:43.238
And if you don't. then
I will do it on my own.

616
00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:06.000
Oh!

617
00:34:06.348 --> 00:34:08.046
Oh.

618
00:34:19.492 --> 00:34:20.319
Amelia!

619
00:34:20.493 --> 00:34:22.190
Are you there?

620
00:34:22.364 --> 00:34:24.062
Hello?

621
00:34:26.151 --> 00:34:27.239
Hello?

622
00:34:28.631 --> 00:34:30.198
Hello?

623
00:34:31.156 --> 00:34:31.982
Amelia: Tam?

624
00:34:32.157 --> 00:34:33.158
Oh. yes. yes.

625
00:34:33.332 --> 00:34:37.118
Just let me step into my office.

626
00:34:37.292 --> 00:34:38.859
Tamara?

627
00:34:39.033 --> 00:34:40.513
Why do you sound like
you're gasping for air?

628
00:34:40.687 --> 00:34:45.387
Me? No. that's just
the breeze.

629
00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:47.433
Our big problem
just got bigger.

630
00:34:47.607 --> 00:34:49.478
It's not just Chad's father
golfing with Bob Kent.

631
00:34:49.652 --> 00:34:51.263
it's Chad himself.

632
00:34:51.437 --> 00:34:53.003
Oh. but Chad can't play golf.

633
00:34:53.178 --> 00:34:54.092
Exactly.

634
00:34:54.266 --> 00:34:56.050
Bob Kent loves winning.

635
00:34:56.224 --> 00:34:58.183
So. this is a disaster and I
need you back in the office now.

636
00:34:58.357 --> 00:34:59.184
What?

637
00:35:02.187 --> 00:35:03.666
Yeah. we have work to do.

638
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.581
We need to completely
reinvent your image

639
00:35:05.755 --> 00:35:08.497
so you can compete with Chad
so need you in the office.

640
00:35:08.671 --> 00:35:09.498
Psst!

641
00:35:10.195 --> 00:35:11.021
Even! Come here!

642
00:35:12.022 --> 00:35:13.067
What was that noise?

643
00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:15.156
No. no. didn't hear anything.

644
00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:16.897
Can you be here
tomorrow morning?

645
00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:18.594
Amelia. you were right about
coming home.

646
00:35:18.768 --> 00:35:20.379
I should stay.

647
00:35:20.553 --> 00:35:21.423
Yes. I've discovered some
very important things here

648
00:35:21.597 --> 00:35:22.250
that need time to bake.

649
00:35:22.424 --> 00:35:24.209
I mean. develop.

650
00:35:24.383 --> 00:35:26.211
Yes. so my pitch will be great.

651
00:35:26.385 --> 00:35:27.908
Better than golf. I promise.

652
00:35:28.082 --> 00:35:30.084
It has to be the best
they've ever seen.

653
00:35:30.258 --> 00:35:31.520
Oh. it will be.

654
00:35:31.694 --> 00:35:32.565
I'll call you soon with updates.
bye.

655
00:35:33.696 --> 00:35:34.349
Comfortable?

656
00:35:34.523 --> 00:35:36.308
Extremely.

657
00:35:36.482 --> 00:35:39.006
Can't get this kind of view
in your fancy corner office.

658
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.183
I'd take the A train over
this ladder any day.

659
00:35:46.448 --> 00:35:49.321
Uh. anyway. Back to work.

660
00:35:51.105 --> 00:35:55.109
Good luck. Oh. sorry.
no such thing.

661
00:36:25.139 --> 00:36:28.447
In the handouts.
which I am going to make.

662
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:30.840
you will see the monthly revenue
for each of the companies

663
00:36:31.014 --> 00:36:32.799
I've brought into
the JDS family.

664
00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:50.164
Oh!

665
00:36:51.644 --> 00:36:54.473
Whoever said easy as pie
has obviously never made one.

666
00:36:54.647 --> 00:36:56.997
Maybe there aren't walnuts
in Grandma's recipe.

667
00:36:57.171 --> 00:36:58.303
Are you ok?

668
00:36:58.477 --> 00:37:00.130
Yeah. why?

669
00:37:02.437 --> 00:37:04.047
Oh. yeah. it's a long story.

670
00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:06.528
But. I think I almost have
Grandma's recipe down.

671
00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:11.011
May I?

672
00:37:18.714 --> 00:37:20.150
Lavender?

673
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:25.112
It's great. but I don't think
it's in your grandma's recipe.

674
00:37:25.286 --> 00:37:27.070
Oh.

675
00:37:28.376 --> 00:37:30.378
There was a secret ingredient
she swore by.

676
00:37:30.552 --> 00:37:33.076
but I can't figure out
what it was.

677
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.035
Love?

678
00:37:35.209 --> 00:37:37.037
No. that part was no secret.

679
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.910
I was thinking scotch.

680
00:37:41.084 --> 00:37:43.435
Of course. only Mary
would think of that.

681
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:45.263
You remember what everyone
called her?

682
00:37:45.437 --> 00:37:47.569
-Mary Queen of Scotch.
-Mary Queen of Scotch.

683
00:37:47.743 --> 00:37:50.268
That's right. Try that one.

684
00:37:57.579 --> 00:37:59.059
Hm.

685
00:38:01.191 --> 00:38:01.975
Not quite.

686
00:38:02.149 --> 00:38:03.716
Oh. what is it?

687
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.153
If the pies aren't perfect
then the plan fails.

688
00:38:06.327 --> 00:38:07.894
I think they still taste great.

689
00:38:08.068 --> 00:38:09.548
Yeah. but not perfect.

690
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.986
How many pies are you making?

691
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.770
Not too many. just 100.

692
00:38:14.944 --> 00:38:15.858
100?

693
00:38:16.032 --> 00:38:17.817
Well. yeah.

694
00:38:17.991 --> 00:38:19.427
I have to test all the possible
ingredient combinations

695
00:38:19.601 --> 00:38:21.386
since I don't have Grandma
Mary's recipe.

696
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.171
Ok.

697
00:38:26.347 --> 00:38:28.131
What are you doing?

698
00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:29.829
Baking 100 pies.

699
00:38:30.003 --> 00:38:31.831
Together?

700
00:38:32.005 --> 00:38:33.223
Oh no. No. no.

701
00:38:33.398 --> 00:38:35.704
That is a recipe for disaster.

702
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.839
I'm sorry for what I said.

703
00:38:40.013 --> 00:38:41.362
Our traditions are worth
fighting for

704
00:38:41.536 --> 00:38:43.973
and you're putting up
a good fight.

705
00:38:44.147 --> 00:38:46.236
I'm sure you've got it
all under control.

706
00:38:48.413 --> 00:38:49.675
Wait.

707
00:38:52.155 --> 00:38:54.157
I could use a little help.

708
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.945
Lot of help would be good too.

709
00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:01.077
Lot of help coming right up.

710
00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:32.761
Oh here. look at this.

711
00:39:32.935 --> 00:39:34.459
Oh.

712
00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:36.286
Always so poised.

713
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:38.245
So beautiful.

714
00:39:38.419 --> 00:39:39.420
Yeah.

715
00:39:39.594 --> 00:39:41.161
I miss her.

716
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:44.991
What?

717
00:39:45.165 --> 00:39:46.819
How did this old paperclip make
it in here but not the recipe?

718
00:39:46.993 --> 00:39:48.255
We need a hint.

719
00:39:48.429 --> 00:39:50.300
One good sign.
just one little...

720
00:39:50.475 --> 00:39:51.301
Clue.

721
00:39:51.476 --> 00:39:52.346
Yes. exactly.

722
00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.478
Her name is on the cover.

723
00:39:53.652 --> 00:39:55.088
Oh!

724
00:39:55.784 --> 00:40:01.181
Excuse me. ma'am. may I interest
you in a tomato banana tart?

725
00:40:01.355 --> 00:40:02.400
Ew!

726
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.794
Oh. wait. Look at these.

727
00:40:07.796 --> 00:40:09.885
Mayonnaise Jello?

728
00:40:10.059 --> 00:40:10.973
It's actually delicious.

729
00:40:11.147 --> 00:40:12.801
Ugh. stop.

730
00:40:15.195 --> 00:40:16.805
Ew. gross. They're all gross.

731
00:40:16.979 --> 00:40:19.373
Ew!

732
00:40:19.547 --> 00:40:22.550
Hey. wait.

733
00:40:22.724 --> 00:40:28.556
Apple slump dessert.
best with top hats?

734
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.123
That's what we call
the apples that grow

735
00:40:30.297 --> 00:40:32.908
on the very top branches
in direct sunlight.

736
00:40:33.082 --> 00:40:34.388
Grandma always talked about
top hats

737
00:40:34.562 --> 00:40:36.216
but I never knew what she meant.

738
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.913
Yeah. they have the shortest
picking window

739
00:40:38.087 --> 00:40:40.133
but also the most sugar.

740
00:40:40.307 --> 00:40:43.441
Probably what made her pies
so sweet.

741
00:40:43.615 --> 00:40:46.226
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

742
00:40:54.582 --> 00:40:55.583
This one looks good.

743
00:40:55.757 --> 00:40:57.280
No. way too sour.

744
00:40:57.455 --> 00:41:00.109
In fact. I better eat
all of these myself

745
00:41:00.283 --> 00:41:01.981
to save you from how
terrible they are.

746
00:41:02.155 --> 00:41:04.853
What a sacrifice.

747
00:41:15.124 --> 00:41:19.041
Adventurous.
driven. legendary?

748
00:41:19.215 --> 00:41:21.217
I'm not gonna tell the Board
I'm legendary.

749
00:41:21.391 --> 00:41:23.393
Remember the time you re-planned
the homecoming parade

750
00:41:23.568 --> 00:41:26.396
in one day after the cafeteria
gave everyone food poisoning?

751
00:41:26.571 --> 00:41:27.920
That was pretty legendary.

752
00:41:28.094 --> 00:41:29.965
That is being resourceful.

753
00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:32.925
Hm. I like legendary better.

754
00:41:33.099 --> 00:41:35.449
Well. Amelia thinks I need
to reinvent myself.

755
00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:37.059
That would be a tragedy.

756
00:41:37.233 --> 00:41:38.931
You know what.

757
00:41:39.105 --> 00:41:39.975
I'm just gonna go in there
and give them the numbers.

758
00:41:40.149 --> 00:41:41.107
They love numbers.

759
00:41:41.281 --> 00:41:42.543
My work speaks for itself.

760
00:41:42.717 --> 00:41:45.459
But what about the three
word thing?

761
00:41:45.633 --> 00:41:48.506
Great... team... player.

762
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.682
Ok. anyone who thinks
you can be described

763
00:41:50.856 --> 00:41:53.989
in three words doesn't
know you very well.

764
00:41:54.163 --> 00:41:55.469
What do you mean?

765
00:41:55.643 --> 00:41:57.993
You're Tamara Hayes.

766
00:41:58.167 --> 00:42:00.779
There's so much more to you than
those people will ever know.

767
00:42:02.563 --> 00:42:04.478
You can't be summarized.

768
00:42:15.663 --> 00:42:17.970
These will be ready in 23 hours.

769
00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:20.015
You know it to the hour?

770
00:42:20.189 --> 00:42:21.974
To the minute.

771
00:42:22.148 --> 00:42:24.280
You have not changed one bit.

772
00:42:24.454 --> 00:42:26.369
Neither have you.

773
00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:31.331
Still the same. Tam.
CEO of big dreams.

774
00:42:31.505 --> 00:42:34.987
Yeah. I don't know about that.

775
00:42:35.161 --> 00:42:36.902
What do you mean?

776
00:42:37.076 --> 00:42:38.860
You're still gonna start
your own business

777
00:42:39.034 --> 00:42:40.862
like you always talked about.
right?

778
00:42:41.036 --> 00:42:43.038
Once upon a time.
I tried to open

779
00:42:43.212 --> 00:42:45.911
my own urban bed and breakfast.

780
00:42:46.085 --> 00:42:48.000
What happened?

781
00:42:48.174 --> 00:42:50.176
Investors pulled out overnight.

782
00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:55.616
Three days before opening.
It was over before it began.

783
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:57.009
I'm really sorry.

784
00:42:57.183 --> 00:42:58.401
It's the way it goes.

785
00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:00.360
It's a long time ago now.

786
00:43:00.534 --> 00:43:01.840
But it's your dream.

787
00:43:02.014 --> 00:43:05.191
Was my dream. When I was
a lot younger.

788
00:43:05.365 --> 00:43:07.019
I'm at the firm now.

789
00:43:09.195 --> 00:43:11.937
Don't give me that look!

790
00:43:12.111 --> 00:43:13.852
What look?

791
00:43:14.026 --> 00:43:15.288
That look you always give
when you think you know better?

792
00:43:15.462 --> 00:43:16.332
Who me?

793
00:43:16.506 --> 00:43:17.333
Who me?
Yes. you.

794
00:43:17.507 --> 00:43:19.161
Come on.

795
00:43:36.178 --> 00:43:37.266
Yes?

796
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.355
Hi. Mr. Sluctor. How are ya?

797
00:43:39.529 --> 00:43:41.009
Great.

798
00:43:41.183 --> 00:43:42.794
What can I help you with?

799
00:43:42.968 --> 00:43:44.360
I just happened to drive
by your place and I noticed

800
00:43:44.534 --> 00:43:46.232
you haven't cut down
your heirlooms yet.

801
00:43:46.406 --> 00:43:48.103
When you happened to drive by
my place did you notice

802
00:43:48.277 --> 00:43:50.062
the 'no solicitors' sign
on the gate?

803
00:43:50.236 --> 00:43:51.454
I'm not a solicitor.
Mr. Sluctor.

804
00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:53.108
I'm your neighbor.

805
00:43:53.282 --> 00:43:55.154
Regardless. I wanted to talk
to you again

806
00:43:55.328 --> 00:43:57.243
about the idea I proposed
the other night.

807
00:43:57.417 --> 00:44:00.159
Before you start the grafting
process with the Red Delicious.

808
00:44:00.333 --> 00:44:02.204
Not interested.

809
00:44:02.378 --> 00:44:03.553
Well. if you have any specific
concerns.

810
00:44:03.728 --> 00:44:04.946
I'd be happy to...

811
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.122
I said. not interested.

812
00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:11.953
Good luck to you.

813
00:44:12.127 --> 00:44:13.085
Ok.

814
00:44:14.303 --> 00:44:15.435
Have a nice day.

815
00:44:19.395 --> 00:44:21.310
I'm delighted to be considered
by the Board for this promotion.

816
00:44:21.484 --> 00:44:23.965
As you can see. I've brought in
a lot of revenue for the company

817
00:44:24.139 --> 00:44:26.011
starting with my very first
acquisition when I started.

818
00:44:26.185 --> 00:44:30.885
With my very first acquisition
when I started my... no!

819
00:44:31.059 --> 00:44:32.931
My very first acquisition when
I started at JDS has brought

820
00:44:33.105 --> 00:44:35.020
in the company a net sum of...

821
00:44:35.194 --> 00:44:36.456
Um. I had it just here.

822
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:37.413
What is it? Three cups of..

823
00:44:37.587 --> 00:44:38.893
That's not it!

824
00:44:39.067 --> 00:44:40.852
Maybe take it again
from the top.

825
00:44:41.026 --> 00:44:43.028
What is the point?

826
00:44:43.202 --> 00:44:44.420
Chad is gonna get it anyway.

827
00:44:44.594 --> 00:44:46.248
Oh. honey.

828
00:45:00.175 --> 00:45:02.264
I've given everything I have
to this job.

829
00:45:02.438 --> 00:45:04.266
I know it.

830
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.834
Every hour. night and day.
it's always Mom. I can't talk.

831
00:45:07.008 --> 00:45:09.271
I'm working.

832
00:45:09.445 --> 00:45:12.318
I'm sorry.

833
00:45:12.492 --> 00:45:16.278
I always thought it would
be one hard year. maybe two.

834
00:45:16.452 --> 00:45:18.237
Then it would just be
smooth sailing.

835
00:45:18.411 --> 00:45:20.805
It's been five.

836
00:45:20.979 --> 00:45:22.937
I know.

837
00:45:23.111 --> 00:45:24.939
What about the pie business?

838
00:45:25.113 --> 00:45:28.029
I can't remember the last time
I've seen you that excited.

839
00:45:28.203 --> 00:45:30.510
No. I don't know if it will work
without Bill.

840
00:45:30.684 --> 00:45:32.251
If Bill doesn't sign on.

841
00:45:32.425 --> 00:45:34.993
we'll need all the other
neighbors to get on board.

842
00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:36.821
Or. maybe Even was right.

843
00:45:36.995 --> 00:45:38.779
Maybe I'm in over my head

844
00:45:38.953 --> 00:45:41.564
because I was trying to distract
myself from my own problems.

845
00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:44.306
You think Even was right?

846
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.004
Pigs must be flying.

847
00:45:46.178 --> 00:45:47.179
Yes. anything is possible. Mom.

848
00:45:47.353 --> 00:45:50.356
In love and war.

849
00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:55.056
I wonder if you really want
this job at JDS?

850
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.710
When you were a little girl.

851
00:45:56.884 --> 00:45:59.017
all you talked about was being
an entrepreneur.

852
00:45:59.191 --> 00:46:01.846
And you had so many
good ideas.

853
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:06.372
Just like this idea to sell
Grandma's pies.

854
00:46:06.546 --> 00:46:09.157
Common sense is all too common.

855
00:46:09.331 --> 00:46:11.464
Honey. you have a gift.

856
00:46:12.726 --> 00:46:15.207
Don't give it up so easy.

857
00:46:15.381 --> 00:46:16.730
But I like my job.

858
00:46:17.731 --> 00:46:19.037
Are you sure?

859
00:46:20.125 --> 00:46:21.561
Of course.

860
00:46:22.257 --> 00:46:24.869
I know you'll follow your heart
in all that matters.

861
00:46:25.043 --> 00:46:27.523
Work and otherwise.

862
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:30.439
Stop.

863
00:46:38.621 --> 00:46:39.927
What about candied ginger?

864
00:46:40.101 --> 00:46:41.407
Oh. spicy.

865
00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.196
Sure. just not a standard
apple pie ingredient.

866
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.247
My grandma always swore
by maple syrup in her pie.

867
00:46:55.421 --> 00:46:57.466
Yeah. I tried that one.
It was delicious

868
00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.252
but it just didn't taste like
Grandma Mary's recipe.

869
00:47:00.426 --> 00:47:02.950
My favorite thing to put in
my pie is my fork.

870
00:47:05.692 --> 00:47:07.955
I'll see you guys
after my class.

871
00:47:08.129 --> 00:47:10.044
Maybe one of my students
will have a suggestion for ya.

872
00:47:10.218 --> 00:47:11.698
Thank you.

873
00:47:16.094 --> 00:47:16.921
You gonna get that?

874
00:47:17.095 --> 00:47:18.096
Nope.

875
00:47:22.274 --> 00:47:25.799
Have you spoken to Grant much?

876
00:47:25.973 --> 00:47:28.149
Yeah. every day.

877
00:47:28.323 --> 00:47:31.109
Has he said anything about me?

878
00:47:31.283 --> 00:47:32.458
What's going on?

879
00:47:32.632 --> 00:47:35.156
I don't know.
it's Grant.

880
00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:37.942
I can resist everything except
for temptation.

881
00:47:41.162 --> 00:47:45.036
Ah. I think about him
all the time.

882
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.256
Except for when I'm with him.
I can't think at all.

883
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:49.779
I'm sick.

884
00:47:51.999 --> 00:47:53.348
Love sick.

885
00:47:53.522 --> 00:47:55.655
Yes. yes. I've seen this before.

886
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:57.570
As the heart fills.
the brain empties

887
00:47:57.744 --> 00:48:01.835
and pretty soon you are smiling
like an idiot.

888
00:48:02.009 --> 00:48:03.097
How much longer?

889
00:48:03.271 --> 00:48:04.316
A week. maybe two.

890
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.971
Oh. I knew it.

891
00:48:07.145 --> 00:48:09.190
So much for the single life.

892
00:48:09.364 --> 00:48:10.844
You know the craziest thing?

893
00:48:11.018 --> 00:48:12.846
As nervous as he makes me.

894
00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.544
I feel the most comfortable
when I'm with him.

895
00:48:15.718 --> 00:48:18.330
I don't know. Hard to explain.

896
00:48:18.504 --> 00:48:20.245
No. I get it. I do.

897
00:48:20.419 --> 00:48:22.943
You do?

898
00:48:23.117 --> 00:48:24.989
Are you referring to Even.
your friend

899
00:48:25.163 --> 00:48:26.512
or Even your sparring partner?

900
00:48:26.686 --> 00:48:28.209
We are not that bad.

901
00:48:28.383 --> 00:48:30.168
Yeah. You go together
like oil and vinegar.

902
00:48:30.342 --> 00:48:31.082
Whatever.

903
00:48:33.171 --> 00:48:34.041
Saved by the bell.

904
00:48:34.215 --> 00:48:36.130
I don't need saving.

905
00:48:36.304 --> 00:48:37.871
I just need the secret
ingredient.

906
00:48:54.366 --> 00:48:56.368
I've been looking
all over for ya!

907
00:48:56.542 --> 00:48:58.022
Me?

908
00:48:58.196 --> 00:49:00.024
They're ready. Come on.

909
00:49:00.198 --> 00:49:02.330
What's ready?

910
00:49:06.204 --> 00:49:07.640
Think about it.

911
00:49:07.814 --> 00:49:09.903
Tam's Pie House.
serving heirloom apple pies.

912
00:49:10.077 --> 00:49:12.079
You'd be your own boss.
doing something you love

913
00:49:12.253 --> 00:49:13.863
and supporting the community.

914
00:49:14.038 --> 00:49:15.387
Yeah. I don't know.

915
00:49:20.392 --> 00:49:21.915
Remember this?

916
00:49:22.089 --> 00:49:25.484
Our old fishing spot.

917
00:49:25.658 --> 00:49:28.922
Your dad always knew
how to find 'em.

918
00:49:29.096 --> 00:49:31.316
I come out here occasionally
to talk to him.

919
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.188
Sometimes it's a sunset
or the breeze

920
00:49:34.362 --> 00:49:36.364
but I feel like he's here.

921
00:49:40.281 --> 00:49:42.109
He could always predict
the perfect sunset.

922
00:49:42.283 --> 00:49:43.589
How did he do that?

923
00:49:43.763 --> 00:49:45.895
He knew everything.

924
00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:49.029
And even when he didn't.
he still did.

925
00:49:49.203 --> 00:49:50.726
It's true.

926
00:49:52.424 --> 00:49:53.381
Why not?

927
00:49:53.555 --> 00:49:54.817
What?

928
00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:56.602
Tam's Pie House.
It could be great.

929
00:49:56.776 --> 00:49:58.256
I was thinking my parents
would take over the pie business

930
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:59.866
once it's up and running.

931
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.215
I mean. it would be great income
for them.

932
00:50:01.389 --> 00:50:02.912
I also have a job

933
00:50:03.087 --> 00:50:05.959
and a very resilient house plant
to get back to.

934
00:50:06.133 --> 00:50:09.267
Well. if that's what you feel
is best.

935
00:50:09.441 --> 00:50:11.965
Even. can I ask you something?

936
00:50:12.139 --> 00:50:14.098
You have traveled
the whole world.

937
00:50:14.272 --> 00:50:16.317
but you ended up here.

938
00:50:16.491 --> 00:50:18.972
Why?

939
00:50:19.146 --> 00:50:21.148
This place is a part of me.

940
00:50:21.322 --> 00:50:24.586
and I like to think
I'm a part of it.

941
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.501
I went traveling to study
different organic

942
00:50:26.675 --> 00:50:29.939
agriculture techniques so
I could be a better teacher.

943
00:50:30.114 --> 00:50:33.334
Everything I learned out there
I brought back here.

944
00:50:33.508 --> 00:50:36.033
Think it could have really made
a difference.

945
00:50:36.207 --> 00:50:37.686
What do you mean could have?

946
00:50:38.774 --> 00:50:40.689
The college is pulling
the funding on our class.

947
00:50:40.863 --> 00:50:43.388
turns out sustainability is
a luxury when money is tight.

948
00:50:43.562 --> 00:50:45.520
Even. I'm so sorry.

949
00:50:45.694 --> 00:50:47.870
Yeah. we've been expecting it
for a while now.

950
00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:51.091
We tried our best.

951
00:50:51.265 --> 00:50:53.659
Truth is. I could travel
the entire world

952
00:50:53.833 --> 00:50:57.489
but this will always be home.

953
00:51:12.156 --> 00:51:13.635
Ok. which one?

954
00:51:13.809 --> 00:51:14.984
How about this one?

955
00:51:15.159 --> 00:51:16.508
Oh. sorry.

956
00:51:16.682 --> 00:51:18.988
No. please. After you.

957
00:51:19.163 --> 00:51:19.946
Ok.

958
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.513
Oh. no. you. ah...

959
00:51:21.687 --> 00:51:22.818
No. Please... You go...
You go ahead.

960
00:51:22.992 --> 00:51:23.602
Ok.

961
00:51:23.776 --> 00:51:24.820
After you.

962
00:51:24.994 --> 00:51:26.692
Ok.

963
00:51:34.047 --> 00:51:35.309
It's perfect.

964
00:51:35.483 --> 00:51:36.528
Well. I don't know
about perfect.

965
00:51:36.702 --> 00:51:38.486
Ok. well that is really good.

966
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.401
I mean. I don't want to take
the words out of your mouth.

967
00:51:40.575 --> 00:51:42.011
No.

968
00:51:42.186 --> 00:51:43.796
This was exactly how
Grandma's used to taste.

969
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:47.930
Yep. Right to the minute.

970
00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:51.543
Well what are we waiting for?
Let's pick some apples.

971
00:52:33.672 --> 00:52:35.282
Yes?

972
00:52:35.456 --> 00:52:37.023
That's where you caught
that huge fish.

973
00:52:37.197 --> 00:52:39.939
Oh yeah. It was as tall as me.

974
00:52:40.113 --> 00:52:42.463
And that's where we watched
the meteor shower.

975
00:52:42.637 --> 00:52:44.422
No. it was over there.
by the trees.

976
00:52:44.596 --> 00:52:46.337
No way. It was by the shore.

977
00:52:46.511 --> 00:52:47.990
I remember. the sand
was freezing.

978
00:52:48.165 --> 00:52:49.731
No way.

979
00:52:49.905 --> 00:52:51.603
It was over there. by the trees.
because I remember

980
00:52:51.777 --> 00:52:53.909
an apple fell on your head
when you tried to kiss me.

981
00:52:54.083 --> 00:52:55.215
Ok. You're right.

982
00:52:55.389 --> 00:52:57.217
It was by the trees.

983
00:52:57.391 --> 00:52:59.176
Oh. we had some fun.
didn't we?

984
00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:01.178
Yeah. we really did.

985
00:53:09.011 --> 00:53:10.274
Sometimes I wonder
what would have happened

986
00:53:10.448 --> 00:53:13.233
if you hadn't stood me up
for prom.

987
00:53:13.407 --> 00:53:16.454
Yeah. I think about that a lot.

988
00:53:16.628 --> 00:53:18.107
You do?

989
00:53:18.282 --> 00:53:20.371
Yeah. especially lately.

990
00:53:21.459 --> 00:53:24.157
I waited and waited.

991
00:53:24.331 --> 00:53:28.335
And then for days after.
I waited for you to call.

992
00:53:28.509 --> 00:53:30.903
But eventually I had to leave
for college.

993
00:53:31.077 --> 00:53:33.949
I just never really understood
what happened.

994
00:53:34.123 --> 00:53:36.474
I was afraid.

995
00:53:36.648 --> 00:53:38.127
Of what?

996
00:53:38.302 --> 00:53:42.523
I don't know. The future.
getting older.

997
00:53:42.697 --> 00:53:46.005
You won that fellowship
and had all these big plans.

998
00:53:46.179 --> 00:53:48.312
I still don't understand.

999
00:53:48.486 --> 00:53:50.879
There was always the next thing.

1000
00:53:51.053 --> 00:53:55.144
I told you. you're Tam.
CEO of big dreams.

1001
00:53:55.319 --> 00:53:58.017
I was afraid that I couldn't
keep up.

1002
00:53:58.191 --> 00:54:00.498
That I'd get tossed aside.

1003
00:54:05.503 --> 00:54:07.505
Even. I never would have done
that to you.

1004
00:54:07.679 --> 00:54:09.115
I know. I should have
trusted you.

1005
00:54:09.289 --> 00:54:13.902
and there's not a day
I don't regret it.

1006
00:54:14.076 --> 00:54:17.036
I went to see you.

1007
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:21.170
I wanted to apologize so I drove
down to your campus.

1008
00:54:21.345 --> 00:54:23.172
But you were with someone.

1009
00:54:23.347 --> 00:54:27.525
He seemed nice.
You looked happy.

1010
00:54:27.699 --> 00:54:29.527
What did he look like?

1011
00:54:29.701 --> 00:54:31.833
Freckles. glasses.

1012
00:54:32.007 --> 00:54:33.748
Alex Gardner.

1013
00:54:33.922 --> 00:54:37.926
He was nice. but we were only
together for a few weeks.

1014
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.406
What happened?

1015
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.843
Just never got that spark.
you know?

1016
00:54:42.017 --> 00:54:44.193
Yeah.

1017
00:54:47.588 --> 00:54:52.158
You know. Apple Days has
a dance on opening night.

1018
00:54:52.332 --> 00:54:54.595
What do you think?
We can give it a go.

1019
00:54:54.769 --> 00:54:56.075
Apple days?

1020
00:54:56.249 --> 00:54:57.337
Yeah. it starts Friday.

1021
00:54:57.511 --> 00:54:58.904
And we can have funnel cake.

1022
00:54:59.078 --> 00:55:00.471
And play ring toss.

1023
00:55:00.645 --> 00:55:02.037
Oh. everyone knows
that game is rigged.

1024
00:55:02.211 --> 00:55:03.343
Which only makes it better
when you win.

1025
00:55:03.517 --> 00:55:05.171
Well. you do owe me.

1026
00:55:05.345 --> 00:55:06.433
Yeah. I certainly do.

1027
00:55:06.607 --> 00:55:08.087
Ok. it's a deal.

1028
00:55:10.742 --> 00:55:12.613
This reminds me of
one of those afternoons

1029
00:55:12.787 --> 00:55:14.920
when we used to run around the
orchard and swim in the lake.

1030
00:55:15.094 --> 00:55:17.488
Ugh. I can't believe we used
to do that.

1031
00:55:17.662 --> 00:55:18.619
What?

1032
00:55:18.793 --> 00:55:20.229
Well. the water's freezing

1033
00:55:20.404 --> 00:55:22.841
and who knows what's lurking
down there.

1034
00:55:23.015 --> 00:55:24.930
When was the last time you swam
in the lake?

1035
00:55:25.104 --> 00:55:27.106
Don't know. but it has not been
long enough.

1036
00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.457
What do you do on hot days?

1037
00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:32.894
Sit by the AC.
drink some ice water.

1038
00:55:33.068 --> 00:55:35.027
Tamara Hayes.

1039
00:55:35.201 --> 00:55:38.117
No wonder you can't think of
your three perfect adjectives.

1040
00:55:38.291 --> 00:55:40.598
Need a little lake swimming
to clear your head.

1041
00:55:40.772 --> 00:55:42.295
Is that so?

1042
00:55:43.644 --> 00:55:47.605
Here's three words.
Absolutely no way.

1043
00:55:47.779 --> 00:55:49.128
What are you doing?

1044
00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.221
Suit yourself.

1045
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:59.051
Swimming in the lake has nothing
to do with my project.

1046
00:55:59.225 --> 00:56:01.183
And that's where you're wrong.

1047
00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:03.011
Everything here
is a part of you.

1048
00:56:03.185 --> 00:56:04.361
Part of your story.

1049
00:56:04.535 --> 00:56:06.798
Especially this lake.

1050
00:56:09.104 --> 00:56:10.149
Don't splash me!

1051
00:56:29.081 --> 00:56:31.344
I'm telling you. there was
something lurking in there.

1052
00:56:31.518 --> 00:56:32.476
Right. right where
we were swimming.

1053
00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:33.172
Oh. 100 percent.

1054
00:56:33.346 --> 00:56:34.478
Yeah.

1055
00:56:34.652 --> 00:56:35.653
-I felt it.
-You felt it!

1056
00:56:35.827 --> 00:56:36.915
That's why I told you. I did...

1057
00:56:37.089 --> 00:56:37.785
Ms. Minnie.

1058
00:56:37.959 --> 00:56:39.831
Hi. Tam.

1059
00:56:40.005 --> 00:56:42.486
Uh. I was hoping to talk to you
in person.

1060
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.531
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

1061
00:56:44.705 --> 00:56:46.968
You know how I grafted a couple
of Gala trees in the orchard

1062
00:56:47.142 --> 00:56:48.535
three years ago?

1063
00:56:48.709 --> 00:56:50.363
Well. we're harvesting
our first crop

1064
00:56:50.537 --> 00:56:53.279
and. Tam. there are a lot more
apples on those trees

1065
00:56:53.453 --> 00:56:56.021
than on the Russets.

1066
00:56:56.195 --> 00:56:58.066
We've decided it's time.

1067
00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.938
We're replacing the rest of
the Knobbed Russets with Galas.

1068
00:57:00.112 --> 00:57:02.027
We just can't afford
to take the risk.

1069
00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:03.550
I'm so sorry. Tam.

1070
00:57:03.724 --> 00:57:04.986
No. It's not your fault
Ms. Minnie.

1071
00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.466
Business is business.

1072
00:57:08.076 --> 00:57:14.387
Mrs. Roy called. she's out
of the pie business too.

1073
00:57:25.703 --> 00:57:29.010
Oh look. It's the deed of sale.

1074
00:57:29.184 --> 00:57:34.494
Sold 1956 to Mary Louise Gatzke.

1075
00:57:34.668 --> 00:57:36.235
You know. she was the first
woman in the valley

1076
00:57:36.409 --> 00:57:38.585
to buy acres on her own?

1077
00:57:38.759 --> 00:57:41.501
And seven years later. she had
a fully-grown orchard.

1078
00:57:41.675 --> 00:57:42.981
That's fast.

1079
00:57:43.155 --> 00:57:44.983
Especially from seed.

1080
00:57:45.157 --> 00:57:47.855
I wish she were here to shake
a finger at Bill Sluctor.

1081
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:49.857
Yeah.

1082
00:57:50.031 --> 00:57:52.033
If he would change his mind
that would change everything.

1083
00:57:52.207 --> 00:57:56.081
You knew you were in trouble
if she shook her finger at you.

1084
00:57:56.255 --> 00:57:57.691
What was her famous line?

1085
00:57:57.865 --> 00:57:59.563
I'm not young enough
to know everything.

1086
00:58:04.263 --> 00:58:07.396
All this reminiscing
is making me sleepy.

1087
00:58:07.571 --> 00:58:10.399
Yeah. me too.

1088
00:58:10.574 --> 00:58:12.271
You know. if you get hungry.

1089
00:58:12.445 --> 00:58:15.013
there's plenty of pie
in the fridge.

1090
00:58:15.187 --> 00:58:16.580
Thank you. Mom.

1091
00:58:36.121 --> 00:58:37.818
Where?

1092
00:58:37.992 --> 00:58:40.168
It was lying under the papers.
waiting to be uncovered.

1093
00:58:44.085 --> 00:58:46.435
"Today the rain tried
to uproot my saplings.

1094
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:49.526
"A bolt of fabric saved
my tender friends.

1095
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:53.094
"A triumph. but now my shoes
are ruined."

1096
00:58:53.268 --> 00:58:54.966
That's classic Grandma.

1097
00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.968
"I saw Sam at The General today.

1098
00:58:57.142 --> 00:59:00.232
"Somehow that man
is always smiling.

1099
00:59:00.406 --> 00:59:04.976
"Even when nothing is funny.
I am going to marry him."

1100
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:09.894
That's Grandpa.

1101
00:59:10.068 --> 00:59:11.983
She was quite the romantic.

1102
00:59:12.157 --> 00:59:13.506
Yeah. I guess she was.

1103
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.987
I want that one day.

1104
00:59:16.161 --> 00:59:17.858
What she and your grandpa had.

1105
00:59:18.032 --> 00:59:20.818
Yeah. their love was timeless.

1106
00:59:20.992 --> 00:59:22.080
Can I see?

1107
00:59:22.254 --> 00:59:23.995
Yeah. of course.

1108
00:59:27.041 --> 00:59:31.002
Sam's favorite. two cups
of sugar plus a little more.

1109
00:59:31.176 --> 00:59:33.004
Three pounds of top hats.
two cups of...

1110
00:59:33.178 --> 00:59:34.658
That's the recipe!

1111
00:59:38.096 --> 00:59:39.358
What's up?

1112
00:59:41.012 --> 00:59:42.230
I just wish we would have found
it earlier

1113
00:59:42.404 --> 00:59:44.493
before everyone dropped out.

1114
00:59:44.668 --> 00:59:47.018
Maybe then they'd see that this
will actually work.

1115
00:59:47.192 --> 00:59:49.107
Everything's not lost.

1116
00:59:49.281 --> 00:59:50.978
At least we get to keep a part
of the orchard's history.

1117
00:59:51.152 --> 00:59:53.981
even if it's just a small part.

1118
00:59:54.155 --> 00:59:56.027
Growing up I always heard
that Grandma's pie recipe

1119
00:59:56.201 --> 00:59:58.116
was blue ribbon worthy.

1120
00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:00.553
I wonder how it would
hold up today?

1121
01:00:02.207 --> 01:00:03.904
Bill Sluctor has been judging
the Apple Days

1122
01:00:04.078 --> 01:00:07.342
baking competition
since before we were born.

1123
01:00:07.516 --> 01:00:08.953
If he says that your pie

1124
01:00:09.127 --> 01:00:11.042
is as good as Grandma Mary's
original then...

1125
01:00:11.216 --> 01:00:13.131
Then everyone else will follow.

1126
01:00:13.305 --> 01:00:15.002
Yeah.

1127
01:00:15.176 --> 01:00:18.092
Winning the blue ribbon would be
such great publicity.

1128
01:00:18.266 --> 01:00:20.138
I can see the business plan now.

1129
01:00:26.144 --> 01:00:28.233
All right.
here goes nothing.

1130
01:00:30.148 --> 01:00:31.976
Oh no. it's past the deadline.

1131
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:33.804
Who says?

1132
01:00:33.978 --> 01:00:35.632
Yeah. look. We're too late.
we missed it by a day.

1133
01:00:35.806 --> 01:00:38.069
No. there's still time.
we just need 400 signatures

1134
01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:40.071
for a late entry.

1135
01:00:41.072 --> 01:00:42.247
How are we gonna do that?

1136
01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:43.901
Tam. Tam. I'll sign.

1137
01:00:44.075 --> 01:00:44.902
Me too.

1138
01:00:45.076 --> 01:00:46.207
Good. that's great.

1139
01:00:46.381 --> 01:00:48.079
398 left to go.

1140
01:00:48.253 --> 01:00:49.907
Ok. so we go door to door.

1141
01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:51.386
And I'll post it on my vlog.

1142
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.258
Three words. Comment.
like. subscribe.

1143
01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:55.260
You only got 12 views
on your last video.

1144
01:00:55.434 --> 01:00:57.523
I know! My following's
really growing.

1145
01:01:01.048 --> 01:01:02.920
It's not the end. Tam.

1146
01:01:03.094 --> 01:01:04.095
I appreciate it.

1147
01:01:04.269 --> 01:01:05.444
But the fair is in two days.

1148
01:01:05.618 --> 01:01:08.316
This was our last real hope.

1149
01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:10.536
Let's just go home.

1150
01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:23.331
Wow. I mean. wow.

1151
01:01:23.505 --> 01:01:24.985
That's exactly.

1152
01:01:25.159 --> 01:01:27.509
It's incredible. sweetheart.
You did it.

1153
01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:30.121
You recreated Grandma's recipe.

1154
01:01:30.295 --> 01:01:33.298
Turns out Tam was onto something
with the candied ginger.

1155
01:01:33.472 --> 01:01:35.909
It was the secret ingredient.

1156
01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:38.477
This is a winning pie.
Tam. Honestly.

1157
01:01:38.651 --> 01:01:42.220
I suspect the Lewis brother
apples made all the difference.

1158
01:01:42.394 --> 01:01:46.137
I'd like to take the credit.
but this was all Tam.

1159
01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:48.139
I'll take the credit.

1160
01:01:49.314 --> 01:01:50.968
It's not quite right.

1161
01:01:51.142 --> 01:01:52.796
Something is wrong.

1162
01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:55.015
What?

1163
01:01:55.189 --> 01:01:56.974
All that's missing is my plate.

1164
01:01:57.148 --> 01:01:59.280
No. something is
definitely missing.

1165
01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:03.676
You're right.

1166
01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:05.286
Something is different.

1167
01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.027
But I followed Grandma's recipe
to a T.

1168
01:02:07.201 --> 01:02:09.203
I didn't miss one single grain
of sugar.

1169
01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:14.208
It's the pan.

1170
01:02:15.122 --> 01:02:16.471
All the photos in the old
cookbook we found

1171
01:02:16.645 --> 01:02:18.299
had thin metal pans.

1172
01:02:18.473 --> 01:02:20.301
She wouldn't have been
baking on Pyrex.

1173
01:02:20.475 --> 01:02:21.999
Of course.

1174
01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:23.652
Her pan would have conducted
heat differently.

1175
01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:25.350
That makes a huge difference.

1176
01:02:25.524 --> 01:02:27.308
Well. it's never going
to be exact

1177
01:02:27.482 --> 01:02:31.138
but this is very close
and very delicious.

1178
01:02:31.312 --> 01:02:33.227
Blue ribbon delicious.

1179
01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:35.012
It just would have been nice
to have one more of

1180
01:02:35.186 --> 01:02:36.883
Grandma's heirloom pies
before the Knobbed Russets

1181
01:02:37.057 --> 01:02:38.537
are cut down.

1182
01:02:38.711 --> 01:02:41.366
This is the greatest gift.
Thank you. Tam.

1183
01:02:53.204 --> 01:02:54.640
Hi.

1184
01:02:54.814 --> 01:02:56.424
We just got a call
from the college.

1185
01:02:56.598 --> 01:02:58.165
They're keeping our class
on the roster.

1186
01:02:58.339 --> 01:02:59.558
No way! That's amazing.

1187
01:02:59.732 --> 01:03:01.386
Professor Lewis.
at your service.

1188
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.388
I can't believe it.

1189
01:03:03.562 --> 01:03:06.217
We need to run down to the
school and speak with the Dean.

1190
01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:10.090
And reserve a classroom
and send out the syllabus.

1191
01:03:10.264 --> 01:03:11.048
Oh. there's just so much...

1192
01:03:11.222 --> 01:03:12.527
Hurry. go!

1193
01:03:12.701 --> 01:03:13.964
No. no. I'll help you
here first.

1194
01:03:14.138 --> 01:03:16.531
Go. You got work to do.
Professor.

1195
01:03:19.708 --> 01:03:20.927
Ok. we'll be back soon.

1196
01:03:21.101 --> 01:03:22.668
Right behind you.

1197
01:03:25.192 --> 01:03:25.976
Tam-Tam.

1198
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:27.542
Yes?

1199
01:03:27.716 --> 01:03:28.979
Do you have something to do
with that?

1200
01:03:29.153 --> 01:03:30.241
No. not at all.

1201
01:03:30.415 --> 01:03:31.764
Oh. come on.

1202
01:03:31.938 --> 01:03:33.592
You know I know you better
than that.

1203
01:03:37.422 --> 01:03:39.032
Ok. maybe just a little.

1204
01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:40.947
Thank you. Tam. Really.

1205
01:03:41.121 --> 01:03:42.427
Don't mention it.

1206
01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:44.255
This community needs that class.

1207
01:03:44.429 --> 01:03:46.431
The Dean just needed to be
reminded of that.

1208
01:03:46.605 --> 01:03:49.434
Yeah. but how did you do it?

1209
01:03:49.608 --> 01:03:51.915
I set him up with one of
our corporate clients

1210
01:03:52.089 --> 01:03:54.004
looking to make
a modest donation.

1211
01:03:54.178 --> 01:03:55.875
Dean Raddler's a tough cookie.

1212
01:03:56.049 --> 01:03:58.573
But. I guess you're tougher.

1213
01:03:58.747 --> 01:04:02.882
Oh yeah. and. um. when Even
smiles. when he really smiles.

1214
01:04:03.056 --> 01:04:04.536
he gets these terrible wrinkles.

1215
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.451
Well. you better hope
it's not genetic.

1216
01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:08.322
Oh. I'm not worried.

1217
01:04:08.496 --> 01:04:10.542
It's just. I've just noticed
he's been extra wrinkly

1218
01:04:10.716 --> 01:04:12.544
since you've been around.

1219
01:04:14.024 --> 01:04:15.808
Don't tell him I told you this.

1220
01:04:15.982 --> 01:04:18.463
but he's been working on his
dance moves for this Friday.

1221
01:04:18.637 --> 01:04:20.117
Really?

1222
01:04:20.291 --> 01:04:21.683
If he can get rid of those
two left feet.

1223
01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.511
Mia and I might have
some serious competition

1224
01:04:23.685 --> 01:04:25.122
from the two of you.

1225
01:04:25.296 --> 01:04:27.124
See ya.

1226
01:04:38.135 --> 01:04:39.179
Well?

1227
01:04:39.353 --> 01:04:41.094
The truck's not turning over.

1228
01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:42.530
That's not what I was asking.

1229
01:04:42.704 --> 01:04:44.010
Yeah? Maybe it should be.

1230
01:04:44.184 --> 01:04:46.360
Well? What's going on with you
and Tam?

1231
01:04:46.534 --> 01:04:49.320
I'm working here.
you should try it.

1232
01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:51.452
Oh. I've been working hard
all day.

1233
01:04:51.626 --> 01:04:52.976
Can you tell?

1234
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:55.282
Wow. yeah. looks like you need
a break.

1235
01:04:55.456 --> 01:04:56.675
Excuse me.

1236
01:04:58.242 --> 01:05:03.812
So. Tam and Even.
Check yes. or no?

1237
01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:05.771
We're just friends.

1238
01:05:05.945 --> 01:05:09.035
Even Lewis and Tamara Hayes
will never be just friends.

1239
01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:11.472
Yeah. well then what would you
like to call it?

1240
01:05:11.646 --> 01:05:12.473
Frenemies?

1241
01:05:12.647 --> 01:05:14.301
Soul mates?

1242
01:05:14.475 --> 01:05:15.912
Two people who can't keep
their eyes off each other?

1243
01:05:16.086 --> 01:05:17.478
I don't know.

1244
01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:18.871
But it doesn't matter
what I call it.

1245
01:05:19.045 --> 01:05:20.351
It only matters
what you call it.

1246
01:05:20.525 --> 01:05:21.874
And I'm worried
you're gonna mess it up.

1247
01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:23.354
Again.

1248
01:05:23.528 --> 01:05:24.921
Since you seem
to know everything.

1249
01:05:25.095 --> 01:05:26.313
you should know
when to stop talking.

1250
01:05:27.575 --> 01:05:30.317
I know a thing or two
about my brother Even.

1251
01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:33.016
And you haven't stopped thinking
about Tam.

1252
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:35.105
Not for one second.

1253
01:05:37.194 --> 01:05:40.501
If you care about her.
and I know you do.

1254
01:05:40.675 --> 01:05:42.677
it's time you say something.

1255
01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:46.246
That's where you're wrong.

1256
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.380
Feeling something and saying
something aren't the same thing.

1257
01:05:49.554 --> 01:05:52.078
She has to go back.

1258
01:05:52.252 --> 01:05:53.950
Ain't it funny?

1259
01:05:54.124 --> 01:05:57.692
For all that hurry.
she's not moving too fast.

1260
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.392
This is a second chance.
brother.

1261
01:06:01.566 --> 01:06:04.351
I don't imagine you'll get
another one.

1262
01:06:47.177 --> 01:06:48.134
And then. he was
talking about

1263
01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:49.962
how beautiful the view was.

1264
01:06:50.136 --> 01:06:52.834
But when I agreed. I realized he
was looking at me.

1265
01:06:54.445 --> 01:06:56.969
You and Grant make
the perfect pair.

1266
01:06:57.143 --> 01:06:59.928
When you find the person
who gives you that spark.

1267
01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:02.105
don't let them go.

1268
01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:04.411
It was just so unexpected.

1269
01:07:04.585 --> 01:07:07.501
One second it's Tuesday morning
and you have a flat tire

1270
01:07:07.675 --> 01:07:09.808
and the next second
you're falling for the goofy kid

1271
01:07:09.982 --> 01:07:12.985
who used to lick icy poles
for attention.

1272
01:07:13.159 --> 01:07:16.902
There are no rules.
You just follow your heart.

1273
01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:18.512
What is she looking for?

1274
01:07:18.686 --> 01:07:20.297
A metal pan.

1275
01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:22.125
Just wishful thinking.

1276
01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:25.476
Look!

1277
01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:26.433
Ah!

1278
01:07:26.607 --> 01:07:27.478
Oh!

1279
01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:30.655
How did this happen?

1280
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:34.137
Well. I told my girlfriends in
the quilting group. of course.

1281
01:07:34.311 --> 01:07:36.835
I told Cam at the post office.

1282
01:07:37.009 --> 01:07:39.794
Oh. and I think Grant told
a few guys at the shop.

1283
01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:41.970
Plus. the cafe. but...

1284
01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:43.494
That was it.

1285
01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:45.974
Well. I guess word
travels fast here.

1286
01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:49.065
And just in the nick of time.

1287
01:07:59.031 --> 01:08:00.815
Evan!

1288
01:08:00.989 --> 01:08:04.036
You're not gonna believe it.
We are going to Apple Days!

1289
01:08:09.998 --> 01:08:11.826
Did you do this?

1290
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.264
Who. me? Nah.

1291
01:08:14.438 --> 01:08:16.004
But my students?

1292
01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:17.876
Well. let's just say that
they're pretty popular.

1293
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:20.052
They seem to know everyone
in this town.

1294
01:08:21.662 --> 01:08:23.099
Oh.

1295
01:08:25.318 --> 01:08:26.319
How did you...

1296
01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:28.278
Mrs. Roy had this lying around.

1297
01:08:28.452 --> 01:08:30.889
Said she'd be more than happy
to donate it to the cause.

1298
01:08:31.063 --> 01:08:33.587
Couldn't stand to see you
so disappointed.

1299
01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:36.808
Just one more thing.

1300
01:08:36.982 --> 01:08:39.115
Anything.

1301
01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:43.597
How do I do this?

1302
01:08:43.771 --> 01:08:45.556
You think you've got
what it bakes?

1303
01:08:46.774 --> 01:08:48.428
Get your apron.

1304
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.822
Now. we add flour and vanilla.

1305
01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:52.954
Oh!

1306
01:08:55.566 --> 01:08:58.090
No. You have a little just...

1307
01:08:58.264 --> 01:08:59.613
Oh. you didn't.

1308
01:08:59.787 --> 01:09:01.398
Oh. but I did.

1309
01:09:01.572 --> 01:09:03.922
Don't do it! Don't!

1310
01:09:04.096 --> 01:09:06.533
Stop! Stop!

1311
01:09:06.707 --> 01:09:07.969
Stop!

1312
01:09:17.936 --> 01:09:19.459
Amelia. hi.

1313
01:09:19.633 --> 01:09:20.939
The Board has moved
the pitch meeting up to

1314
01:09:21.113 --> 01:09:22.070
first thing tomorrow morning.

1315
01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:24.247
Do you know what that means?

1316
01:09:24.421 --> 01:09:26.945
I gotta get back.

1317
01:09:27.119 --> 01:09:28.816
If your pitch doesn't blow them
out of the water.

1318
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:31.428
Chad is going to be your boss.

1319
01:09:31.602 --> 01:09:33.081
No. that's not gonna happen.

1320
01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:34.822
I'll be there with my three
perfect words.

1321
01:09:34.996 --> 01:09:36.346
Fantastic.

1322
01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.045
And remember.
perfectly imperfect.

1323
01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:41.786
Right. I'll see you soon.

1324
01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.091
Hurry.

1325
01:09:49.446 --> 01:09:50.969
Is everything ok?

1326
01:09:51.143 --> 01:09:54.494
They moved the pitches up
to tomorrow morning.

1327
01:09:54.668 --> 01:09:56.279
I need to get back to the city.
I need my words.

1328
01:09:56.453 --> 01:09:57.758
I need. I need. I need...

1329
01:09:57.932 --> 01:09:59.804
What about the baking
competition?

1330
01:09:59.978 --> 01:10:01.414
It's tomorrow.

1331
01:10:05.026 --> 01:10:06.376
We can do both.

1332
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:08.204
Are you sure that'll be
enough time?

1333
01:10:08.378 --> 01:10:10.467
I think we can have our pie
and eat it too.

1334
01:10:23.523 --> 01:10:25.133
I'm going to be back
before you can blink.

1335
01:10:25.308 --> 01:10:27.310
Don't worry.

1336
01:10:27.484 --> 01:10:30.922
Just. good luck.
And drive... Safe.

1337
01:10:31.096 --> 01:10:32.053
Yes. Mom.

1338
01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:37.798
See you guys.

1339
01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:44.152
So I cleaned your windshield.
checked your oil.

1340
01:10:44.327 --> 01:10:46.198
Checked your tire pressure.

1341
01:10:46.372 --> 01:10:47.591
Everything's good.

1342
01:10:47.765 --> 01:10:49.201
Thank you. Dad.

1343
01:10:49.549 --> 01:10:50.768
And Tam?

1344
01:10:51.159 --> 01:10:52.378
One more thing.

1345
01:10:56.513 --> 01:10:58.210
Whatever happens.

1346
01:10:58.384 --> 01:11:01.996
just want you to remember
that we're proud of you.

1347
01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:06.653
Not just me and your mom.
the community. Ok?

1348
01:11:08.699 --> 01:11:10.222
Thank you. Dad.

1349
01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:11.919
Ok. well you better hurry up.

1350
01:11:12.093 --> 01:11:13.704
Looks like it might rain.

1351
01:11:16.402 --> 01:11:18.056
Ok.

1352
01:11:19.579 --> 01:11:20.537
Bye. everyone.

1353
01:11:54.048 --> 01:11:55.876
Oh. for Amelia.

1354
01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:57.095
Thank you.

1355
01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:00.925
Hello.

1356
01:12:01.099 --> 01:12:02.143
Now. don't let them know
you're nervous.

1357
01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:03.928
They can smell fear.

1358
01:12:04.102 --> 01:12:05.712
I'm not nervous.

1359
01:12:05.886 --> 01:12:07.061
That's perfect. Keep faking
exactly like that.

1360
01:12:07.235 --> 01:12:09.020
Ok.

1361
01:12:09.194 --> 01:12:10.456
You are prepared. right?

1362
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:11.892
You have something amazing?

1363
01:12:12.066 --> 01:12:13.546
You'll see.

1364
01:12:19.117 --> 01:12:21.641
Good morning. everyone.
Thank you for being here.

1365
01:12:21.815 --> 01:12:23.948
We can just get right to it.
if you don't mind.

1366
01:12:24.122 --> 01:12:25.558
Oh. thank you are prepared.

1367
01:12:25.732 --> 01:12:26.864
I know you all came
to hear about

1368
01:12:27.038 --> 01:12:28.431
what I brought to the company.

1369
01:12:28.605 --> 01:12:30.171
Salinger Medical.
Chloe's Careers

1370
01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.999
and my other investments.

1371
01:12:32.173 --> 01:12:35.002
Outlined in the packet is
their generated daily revenue.

1372
01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:36.613
Daily?

1373
01:12:38.528 --> 01:12:40.268
Tamara. why are you
the right fit for partner?

1374
01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:41.922
I'm glad you asked.

1375
01:12:42.096 --> 01:12:43.446
The key to understanding
who I am

1376
01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:46.144
is understanding
where I came from.

1377
01:12:46.318 --> 01:12:49.321
I grew up on an apple orchard
in Hermansville.

1378
01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:50.975
just a few hours from here.

1379
01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:52.933
where there's a whole community
of farmers

1380
01:12:53.107 --> 01:12:55.066
who grow unique
heirloom apples.

1381
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.329
So. I understand
small businesses.

1382
01:12:57.503 --> 01:12:59.026
I know the struggle.

1383
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:02.813
the joy and the community
that they can build.

1384
01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:05.293
If you had to describe yourself
in three words.

1385
01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:06.991
what would they be?

1386
01:13:07.165 --> 01:13:11.474
A leader. a doer. a friend.

1387
01:13:24.051 --> 01:13:30.231
I am a daughter.
a granddaughter.

1388
01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.408
a creative mind.

1389
01:13:32.582 --> 01:13:35.541
an out of the box thinker.

1390
01:13:35.715 --> 01:13:38.196
A dreamer. a member
of my community.

1391
01:13:41.025 --> 01:13:43.375
Stubborn as heck.

1392
01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:51.383
You want to know who I am?

1393
01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:54.647
I am not the right person
for this job.

1394
01:13:54.821 --> 01:13:56.127
I hate golf.

1395
01:13:56.301 --> 01:13:57.781
Conference rooms?

1396
01:13:57.955 --> 01:14:01.567
Don't even get me started
on board meetings.

1397
01:14:01.741 --> 01:14:03.177
I don't want to make money
for people

1398
01:14:03.351 --> 01:14:07.225
who don't know anything
about people.

1399
01:14:07.399 --> 01:14:12.230
Or get so focused on dollars
that I lose my sense.

1400
01:14:12.404 --> 01:14:16.060
I want to chase dreams.
my own.

1401
01:14:16.234 --> 01:14:19.585
And. other people's.

1402
01:14:19.759 --> 01:14:22.545
I want to help my community.

1403
01:14:22.719 --> 01:14:24.111
Tamara?

1404
01:14:28.115 --> 01:14:29.552
Thank you.

1405
01:14:31.075 --> 01:14:33.599
I really appreciate
this opportunity.

1406
01:14:36.254 --> 01:14:38.169
But I quit.

1407
01:14:49.397 --> 01:14:50.703
How'd it go?

1408
01:14:53.663 --> 01:14:56.100
Couldn't have gone better.

1409
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.872
Oh. thank you.

1410
01:15:53.505 --> 01:15:58.902
Ladies and gentlemen!
Keep your eyes on the pie.

1411
01:15:59.076 --> 01:16:02.514
Our most popular competition
is starting now.

1412
01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:41.901
I don't know.

1413
01:16:42.075 --> 01:16:44.512
I think he likes it.

1414
01:16:53.565 --> 01:16:55.915
Mm.

1415
01:16:56.089 --> 01:17:01.225
Well. now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

1416
01:17:01.399 --> 01:17:03.880
The competition was stiff.

1417
01:17:04.054 --> 01:17:05.882
The pies are tasty.

1418
01:17:06.056 --> 01:17:08.406
My mouth is still watering.

1419
01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:12.889
But. uh. whose masterpiece
will take home the blue ribbon

1420
01:17:13.063 --> 01:17:16.893
for the best apple pie
in the state?

1421
01:17:17.067 --> 01:17:18.024
It's time to find out.

1422
01:17:18.198 --> 01:17:19.678
So. we'll get right to it.

1423
01:17:19.852 --> 01:17:24.074
Third place is awarded
to Pink Pearl of Wisdom.

1424
01:17:28.121 --> 01:17:34.388
Second place goes to none other
than the great. one and only.

1425
01:17:34.562 --> 01:17:35.389
Opal's Rare Gem.

1426
01:17:39.785 --> 01:17:43.441
Looks like there'll be a new
state champion this time around.

1427
01:17:43.615 --> 01:17:49.316
Finally. I'm proud to present
the one and only blue ribbon

1428
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:56.019
for best apple pie to
the incredible. inexplicable.

1429
01:17:56.193 --> 01:18:00.937
magical. Mary and Tam's
Knobbed Russet-

1430
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:08.248
Mary would be so proud.

1431
01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:13.297
So. this is a momentous win
for Ms. Hayes.

1432
01:18:13.471 --> 01:18:17.083
A first-time competitor
who found her Grandmother's

1433
01:18:17.257 --> 01:18:20.957
beloved pie recipe
in an old diary.

1434
01:18:21.131 --> 01:18:24.003
And whose win only goes
to show that.

1435
01:18:24.177 --> 01:18:28.312
well. with a little sugar
and a lot of grit.

1436
01:18:28.486 --> 01:18:29.792
anything can happen.

1437
01:18:29.966 --> 01:18:32.011
Thank you.

1438
01:18:32.185 --> 01:18:34.797
As is traditional. any words
from the winner?

1439
01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:36.015
Oh.

1440
01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:42.021
If there's one thing
I've learnt.

1441
01:18:42.195 --> 01:18:44.807
it's that this kind of success
can't be achieved on your own.

1442
01:18:44.981 --> 01:18:47.897
This ribbon isn't just mine.

1443
01:18:48.071 --> 01:18:51.204
it belongs to everyone
in Hermansville.

1444
01:18:51.378 --> 01:18:53.641
Without their support.

1445
01:18:53.816 --> 01:18:58.516
or their delicious heirloom
apples. I wouldn't be here.

1446
01:18:58.690 --> 01:18:59.822
Thank you all.

1447
01:18:59.996 --> 01:19:01.258
Thank you so much.

1448
01:19:05.088 --> 01:19:06.045
Thank you.

1449
01:19:12.008 --> 01:19:13.009
You did it.

1450
01:19:13.183 --> 01:19:15.141
We did it.

1451
01:19:16.316 --> 01:19:17.013
Tam.

1452
01:19:17.187 --> 01:19:18.666
Yes?

1453
01:19:18.841 --> 01:19:22.105
That pie was exactly like
your grandmother's.

1454
01:19:22.279 --> 01:19:22.888
Perfect.

1455
01:19:23.062 --> 01:19:24.542
Thank you.

1456
01:19:24.716 --> 01:19:26.283
I'm sure she'd be very happy
to hear that.

1457
01:19:26.457 --> 01:19:29.982
And you're sure that you can
duplicate this pie?

1458
01:19:30.156 --> 01:19:31.854
To a T.

1459
01:19:32.028 --> 01:19:33.420
Well. you were right.

1460
01:19:33.594 --> 01:19:35.509
Sometimes the reward
is worth the risk.

1461
01:19:35.683 --> 01:19:38.991
So. you can count me in.

1462
01:19:39.165 --> 01:19:40.340
If you'll still have me?

1463
01:19:40.514 --> 01:19:41.907
Yes. of course.

1464
01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:44.257
I won't let you down.
Mr. Sluctor.

1465
01:19:44.431 --> 01:19:45.911
Can I hug you?
Thank you so much!

1466
01:19:46.085 --> 01:19:48.044
Thank you. thank you.

1467
01:20:14.113 --> 01:20:15.811
Amelia?

1468
01:20:15.985 --> 01:20:16.942
Tamara. darling. you left
so fast I didn't get a chance

1469
01:20:17.116 --> 01:20:18.509
to talk to you.

1470
01:20:18.683 --> 01:20:20.598
Yeah. I had somewhere
I needed to be.

1471
01:20:20.772 --> 01:20:23.079
Is there any way I can
persuade you to come back?

1472
01:20:23.253 --> 01:20:24.254
Didn't I blow it?

1473
01:20:24.428 --> 01:20:26.952
No. the Board loved your pitch.

1474
01:20:27.126 --> 01:20:30.651
Especially the exit.
that was genius.

1475
01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:33.611
In fact. you're a shoo-in
for the promotion.

1476
01:20:33.785 --> 01:20:36.962
Amelia. I meant what I said.
I can't accept this job.

1477
01:20:37.136 --> 01:20:38.964
Really?

1478
01:20:39.138 --> 01:20:42.663
I came home and I learnt who I
am and who I am is not this job.

1479
01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:46.798
You would have your own office.
company car.

1480
01:20:48.278 --> 01:20:50.280
Office and car aside.

1481
01:20:50.454 --> 01:20:52.456
this is what you've been working
so hard for

1482
01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:55.024
for the last five years.

1483
01:20:55.198 --> 01:20:57.069
You want this more
than anyone I know.

1484
01:20:57.243 --> 01:20:59.680
You deserve this more
than anyone I know.

1485
01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:03.162
You're not really gonna just
toss that aside. are you?

1486
01:21:05.469 --> 01:21:07.123
I don't know what else to say.

1487
01:21:07.297 --> 01:21:10.648
I think you do.

1488
01:21:10.822 --> 01:21:15.348
But the pie business.
I want to help it along.

1489
01:21:15.522 --> 01:21:18.525
What better way to help
than to be a well-connected.

1490
01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:21.485
power walking point of contact?

1491
01:21:21.659 --> 01:21:26.142
You want to help your community?
You take this job.

1492
01:21:28.361 --> 01:21:30.320
I accept.

1493
01:21:30.494 --> 01:21:32.278
I'll be there on Monday.

1494
01:21:34.063 --> 01:21:36.326
Great. I'll see you then.

1495
01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:52.472
Hey. I was trying to find you.

1496
01:21:52.646 --> 01:21:53.560
Even. I have something
to tell you.

1497
01:21:53.734 --> 01:21:55.084
I'm headed out.

1498
01:21:55.258 --> 01:21:56.215
What about the dance?

1499
01:21:56.389 --> 01:21:58.174
What about it?

1500
01:21:58.348 --> 01:22:00.045
I thought we had a date?

1501
01:22:00.219 --> 01:22:03.831
I heard you on the phone. Tam.
I know you're leaving.

1502
01:22:04.006 --> 01:22:05.833
Yeah. I got the promotion.

1503
01:22:06.008 --> 01:22:07.400
You promised.

1504
01:22:07.574 --> 01:22:09.011
You promised you wouldn't
toss this aside.

1505
01:22:09.185 --> 01:22:11.883
That you'd see it through.

1506
01:22:12.057 --> 01:22:14.233
This promotion is everything.

1507
01:22:14.407 --> 01:22:16.105
I'll be able to provide
invaluable resources

1508
01:22:16.279 --> 01:22:18.368
for the community.
can't you see that?

1509
01:22:18.542 --> 01:22:21.371
Sure. I believe that
you believe that.

1510
01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:23.939
This is just so classic Tam.

1511
01:22:24.113 --> 01:22:25.941
Moving on from one thing
to the next.

1512
01:22:26.115 --> 01:22:27.855
I don't know why I thought it
would be different this time.

1513
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:29.945
What are you talking about?

1514
01:22:30.119 --> 01:22:31.337
I am doing this for everyone.

1515
01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:32.469
Yeah. I'll be in
a different place.

1516
01:22:32.643 --> 01:22:34.514
but I'll still be helping.

1517
01:22:34.688 --> 01:22:37.387
The entire town changed their
lives to take a chance on you.

1518
01:22:37.561 --> 01:22:40.042
including me.

1519
01:22:40.216 --> 01:22:42.958
I am trying to help.

1520
01:22:43.132 --> 01:22:44.916
You're trying to leave.

1521
01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:47.092
This is exactly what I was
afraid about in the beginning.

1522
01:22:47.266 --> 01:22:49.573
and I was right.

1523
01:22:49.747 --> 01:22:53.359
What is this really about?

1524
01:22:53.533 --> 01:22:55.013
You've already made
your decision.

1525
01:22:55.187 --> 01:22:56.972
There's no point in dragging
this out further.

1526
01:22:57.146 --> 01:22:59.452
Doesn't matter what I do. you
will always choose to see things

1527
01:22:59.626 --> 01:23:01.585
the way that you want
to see them.

1528
01:23:01.759 --> 01:23:04.022
I'm not going to beg you
to trust me.

1529
01:23:20.256 --> 01:23:22.258
Hey. Tam. you going
so soon?

1530
01:23:22.432 --> 01:23:24.608
Uh. yeah.

1531
01:23:24.782 --> 01:23:26.523
You're not really leaving.
are you?

1532
01:23:26.697 --> 01:23:28.264
Um. I need to get back
to the city.

1533
01:23:28.438 --> 01:23:29.874
I have to get back for work.

1534
01:23:30.048 --> 01:23:31.658
Oh. sweetie. What did he do?

1535
01:23:31.832 --> 01:23:34.444
No. no. no. nothing.
Um. I just have a lot to do.

1536
01:23:34.618 --> 01:23:35.880
Tam. come on.

1537
01:23:36.054 --> 01:23:38.970
Even's already spoiled one dance
for you.

1538
01:23:39.144 --> 01:23:41.581
Let's celebrate your victory.
You worked so hard.

1539
01:23:41.755 --> 01:23:45.063
Thank you. I love you.
I'll talk to you soon. ok?

1540
01:23:54.203 --> 01:23:55.204
Hey.

1541
01:23:55.378 --> 01:23:57.206
You're making a big mistake.

1542
01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.208
I appreciate you looking out for
me but I did the right thing.

1543
01:23:59.382 --> 01:24:00.861
Do you really believe that?

1544
01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:02.559
If you let a woman
like Tamara Hayes go.

1545
01:24:02.733 --> 01:24:04.343
you're the one that's wrong.

1546
01:24:04.517 --> 01:24:06.476
I'm tired of you sticking
your nose in my business.

1547
01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:07.781
You don't know the whole story.

1548
01:24:07.955 --> 01:24:09.392
Sure I do.

1549
01:24:09.566 --> 01:24:11.263
Tam opened up to you
and you got scared.

1550
01:24:11.437 --> 01:24:13.352
You've never appreciated her
the way that you should

1551
01:24:13.526 --> 01:24:14.875
and I'm sick of it.

1552
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.008
I'm not gonna let you hurt
her again.

1553
01:24:17.182 --> 01:24:18.401
You're supposed to be
my brother.

1554
01:24:18.575 --> 01:24:20.142
Evan. that's why I'm here.

1555
01:24:20.316 --> 01:24:22.318
I'm trying to help.

1556
01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:45.254
They told me you were
going home?

1557
01:24:45.428 --> 01:24:47.038
Yeah. I got the job.

1558
01:24:47.212 --> 01:24:48.909
Well. that's amazing.

1559
01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:52.217
There's so much celebrating
to do.

1560
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:54.567
Yeah. I don't really feel
like celebrating.

1561
01:24:58.702 --> 01:25:02.488
Dad. am I doing the right thing?

1562
01:25:02.662 --> 01:25:04.838
I don't know. pumpkin.

1563
01:25:05.012 --> 01:25:07.537
But guess what. you do.

1564
01:25:07.711 --> 01:25:10.540
What feels right?

1565
01:25:10.714 --> 01:25:13.978
I worked so hard for this job

1566
01:25:14.152 --> 01:25:16.546
and then I got home
and everything changed.

1567
01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:21.507
Trust yourself.

1568
01:25:21.681 --> 01:25:26.904
After all. only you are
an expert on you.

1569
01:25:27.078 --> 01:25:30.951
But I'm not sure about
anything anymore.

1570
01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:36.305
You know what I always say
about finding yourself.

1571
01:25:36.479 --> 01:25:40.091
Wherever you go.
there you are.

1572
01:25:45.531 --> 01:25:50.406
Hey. you're not gonna
let him go that easily. are ya?

1573
01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:53.017
Dad. I don't think he wants
to be with me.

1574
01:25:53.191 --> 01:25:55.062
He's scared.

1575
01:25:55.237 --> 01:25:58.762
All of us fools in love are
when we have something to lose.

1576
01:26:02.026 --> 01:26:05.986
If there's anything I've learned
in all these years.

1577
01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:12.297
it's that it's never too late
to dance.

1578
01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:13.777
Ok?

1579
01:26:15.474 --> 01:26:16.432
I love you. Dad.

1580
01:26:16.606 --> 01:26:18.608
Oh. I love you so much.

1581
01:26:44.503 --> 01:26:45.896
Tamara?

1582
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:47.332
I really am flattered. Amelia.

1583
01:26:47.506 --> 01:26:49.856
but I've realized I can't accept
the job.

1584
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:52.946
This is the big one.
are you sure?

1585
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.862
Thank you.

1586
01:26:56.036 --> 01:26:57.821
But I think I found
the big one here.

1587
01:27:11.269 --> 01:27:13.663
-Tam!
-Hey!

1588
01:27:18.058 --> 01:27:19.495
Oh. honey.

1589
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:21.410
I'm so glad to see you.

1590
01:27:21.584 --> 01:27:23.020
I'm sorry. Mom.

1591
01:27:23.194 --> 01:27:24.500
I really thought I was doing
the right thing.

1592
01:27:24.674 --> 01:27:26.023
Never mind that.

1593
01:27:26.197 --> 01:27:28.982
You're here now.
that's what's important.

1594
01:27:29.156 --> 01:27:30.897
So. how long are you staying?

1595
01:27:31.071 --> 01:27:32.812
I think for a while.

1596
01:27:32.986 --> 01:27:33.857
I knew it.

1597
01:27:34.031 --> 01:27:35.032
Hey!

1598
01:27:47.523 --> 01:27:49.264
Has anyone seen Evan?

1599
01:28:02.146 --> 01:28:03.669
Ms. Hayes?

1600
01:28:09.675 --> 01:28:11.808
Evan Lewis.

1601
01:28:11.982 --> 01:28:15.899
You have no idea how glad
I am to see you.

1602
01:28:16.073 --> 01:28:17.901
I guess it's true what they say.

1603
01:28:18.075 --> 01:28:23.428
Any man can make a mistake.
but only an idiot persists.

1604
01:28:23.602 --> 01:28:27.867
I was just so afraid
that I would lose you.

1605
01:28:28.041 --> 01:28:31.436
but I never meant to hurt you.

1606
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:34.265
Even. I will never
leave you behind.

1607
01:28:38.138 --> 01:28:41.098
You are the best thing that
has ever happened to me.

1608
01:28:43.622 --> 01:28:45.929
I love you.

1609
01:28:46.103 --> 01:28:48.105
Can I revise my answer?

1610
01:28:50.586 --> 01:28:56.069
Smart. beautiful. my everything.

1611
01:28:56.243 --> 01:29:00.422
That's four words.

1612
01:29:59.089 --> 01:30:00.351
One blue ribbon pie.

1613
01:30:00.525 --> 01:30:02.701
Coming right up.

1614
01:30:12.058 --> 01:30:14.800
Get back to work.
