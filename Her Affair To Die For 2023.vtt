Is the wine OK?
It's fine.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.040
What's that?

7
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.040
Grace. I want us to start over.
I love you.

8
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.360
You were with someone else.

9
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.000
How do you expect me
to trust you again?

10
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.040
Gracie.

11
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.880
You've got to let me try.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.520
I am so sorry.

14
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.160
Thanks for walking me to my car. Yeah.

15
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.760
This is nice.
It is.

16
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.920
Can I call you tomorrow?
Jason...

17
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.160
Just come home.
I'm ready to try again.

TYRES SCREECH.
BOTH CRY OUT

21
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.120
{\an8}You'll have to do better than that.
First one to the top wins.

22
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120
{\an8}THEY GIGGLE

23
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.360
{\an8}Oh!
SHE GIGGLES

24
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.440
{\an8}Victory!

25
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.560
{\an8}I'm gonna miss this.

26
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.120
{\an8}Mom.

27
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.840
{\an8}What? This is where we used
to have your birthday parties

28
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.880
{\an8}when you were little.

29
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.880
{\an8}I've come to love
our morning runs here.

30
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.640
{\an8}Hey. we said no tears.
I'm only moving 15 minutes away.

31
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.720
{\an8}Just wait until you're a mother.
you'll understand.

32
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.040
{\an8}Bright side. you can start running
with Dad again.

33
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.360
{\an8}Your father hates to run.
He hates to lose.

34
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.000
{\an8}Maybe I should let him win. too.

35
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
{\an8}Hey. I won. fair and square.
Race you home?

36
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.160
{\an8}Go!

37
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.520
{\an8}Morning. Sam.

39
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.040
You just don't think
you can run without me.

40
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.640
OK.
LIZ CHUCKLES

41
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.760
There you are.

42
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.720
Hey. sweetheart.
You said you'd come running with us.

43
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.920
I'm sorry. I just got caught up
with the case and all...

44
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.920
OK.
I just can't keep up with you two.

45
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.840
At least stay for breakfast?

46
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.160
And before you say no.
just remember. I'm moving out.

47
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.080
Wait. You finally found a roommate?

48
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.520
I'm meeting
a few more candidates today.

49
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.400
but I might hang some more flyers
on campus. just to be safe.

50
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.720
Sweetheart. we can cover
the other half of the rent

51
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.480
until you find somebody.
Thank you.

52
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.480
But I'm sure it'll work out.
Come on. Stay.

53
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.040
Mom's making pancakes.

54
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.080
Twenty minutes.

55
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.480
Thank you. Liz.
These were delicious.

56
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.200
Yeah. thanks. Mom.
You're welcome. sweetie.

57
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.280
It's amazing you found time
to fill these baking orders.

58
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.360
Luckily. Christina helped.

59
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.920
What are you gonna do
when I move out?

60
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.600
You can't do all this by yourself.

61
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.440
Well. maybe it's time
I hired some help.

62
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.520
Dad can help.

63
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.720
I guess you didn't tell her.
Tell me what?

64
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.840
Your dad's up for managing partner.

65
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.920
SHE SCREAMS
That's fantastic!

66
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.760
Will you hire me
as summer associate?

67
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.960
Oh. my God. I love you.
But it's not a done deal. Yet.

68
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.840
Which is why I won't have
much free time.

69
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.200
So I'm sorry I can't help more. Liz.

70
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.280
It's OK. Sam offered to pitch in
until I find someone.

71
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.320
Sam's helping out. huh?

72
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.040
He wanted to thank me for baking
Stacy's sweet sixteen cake.

73
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.640
Oh. which reminds me.

74
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.440
Christina. you still haven't told me
what you want for your birthday.

75
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.680
You know I live for chocolate.

76
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.520
But you're keeping this party
simple. right?

77
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.080
A few friends. finger foods...
Small and tasteful.

78
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.520
Please be sure that this party's
on your calendar.

79
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.920
Mom. come on.
He'll be here if he can.

80
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.080
I have to get to class.
Bye. sweetie.

81
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.440
Love you guys.
Love you. too.

82
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.240
Have a good day.

83
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.360
Do you have to put me
on the spot like that?

84
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.600
I just don't want her
to be disappointed.

85
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.280
Well. Liz. she's a big girl now.

86
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.280
And she understands the pressure
that I'm under.

87
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.160
And I don't? I barely have time
to plan her party.

88
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.880
That's because
you're taking on too much.

89
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.760
I thought this baking thing
was a hobby.

90
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.560
It's not a hobby. Noah. It's my job.

91
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.160
And you said you supported it.

92
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
And I do. Liz.

93
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.920
but this promotion is more than
just putting in the hours.

94
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.360
I've got dinners.
I've got functions.

95
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.280
I'll need you there.

96
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.840
And I can't do both?
KNOCK ON DOOR

97
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.120
Morning. Noah.

98
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.200
Sam.

99
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.080
So. where can I start?

100
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.960
Um. can you fold bakery boxes?

101
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.120
You got it.

102
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.920
You should go.
or you're gonna be late. Right.

103
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.120
Is everything OK?
Yeah.

104
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.800
Hey.
Hey.

105
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.440
You're putting up more flyers?

106
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.160
Still looking
for that perfect roommate.

107
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.280
Babe. I'm here for you.
You know I'm a good cook. too.

108
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.320
SHE CHUCKLES

109
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.000
We've only been dating a couple
of months. you can't move in.

110
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.440
So I'll spend the night. right?
I'll think about it.

111
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.800
Think about it? Think about this.

112
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.440
Don't you have a class?

113
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.920
Careful. A lot of weirdos out there.

114
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.320
So. my boyfriend was cheating on me
with one of my sorority sisters.

115
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.720
And there's no way that I'm gonna
keep living with that slut

116
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.680
in the Kappa Beta Kappa house.

117
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.440
Uh. so you're looking
for a new place to live?

118
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.600
And that's why I like cats
more than I like humans.

119
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.440
Ah. OK. And you own a lot of cats?

120
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.160
Well. I prefer to say I cohabitate.
You're not allergic. are you?

121
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.320
Hi. Just a second.

122
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.960
Sorry.

123
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.720
Christina. right?
Yeah.

124
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.000
I'm Alyssa.
It's so nice to meet you.

125
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.840
You as well. So. you said
on the phone you just moved here?

126
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.800
That's right. Needed a fresh start.
Bad break-up.

127
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.880
He was kind of a jerk.
so it wasn't hard getting over him.

128
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.280
His loss. So. was it difficult
transferring schools?

129
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.920
Oh. I'm not a student.
I saw your ad at a cafe.

130
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.480
Oh. which one?
This cafe.

131
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.200
It's right next door to the hospital
I volunteer at.

132
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.280
I love this place.
We study here all the time.

133
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.560
That's really sweet that
you volunteer at the hospital.

134
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.840
by the way.

135
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.960
I spent a lot of time at hospitals
when I was a kid.

136
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.800
Oh. were you sick?
My dad. Pancreatic cancer.

137
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.800
Oh. I'm so sorry.

138
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.360
During his treatments.
the nurses would take care of me.

139
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.760
We'd play poker. eat ice cream.

140
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.920
which made everything
a little less scary.

141
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.280
And now you volunteer.

142
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.560
Yeah. I understand what people
are going through.

143
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.080
and I wanna try to make it easier.
if I can.

144
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.080
Plus.
I'm a pretty good poker shark now.

145
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.960
Good to know.
Tell me about you.

146
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.440
I'm a law student. First year.
I wanna fight for the underdog.

147
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.760
Like my dad used to do

148
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.440
before he had to go
into corporate law to pay the bills.

149
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.400
Um. so. I do have to ask.
just cos we're splitting the rent.

150
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.720
you work. right?

151
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.320
Oh. yeah. I'm a personal trainer.

152
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.960
I work as an office temp.
I even walk dogs.

153
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.600
I know that doesn't sound
very ambitious.

154
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.880
but the truth is.
I always wanted to get married.

155
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.120
Have that perfect family.
No judgment.

156
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.920
My mom loved being a housewife.

157
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.120
And now she runs a bakery business
out of her house.

158
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.160
That's amazing!
Your mom sounds really smart.

159
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.960
Thanks. She is.

160
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.840
So. the apartment
is actually just off campus.

161
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.080
Do you wanna walk over
and check it out?

162
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.320
I'd love to.

163
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.440
You're in early. Trying to give me
a run for managing partner?

164
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.040
Worried?
Not really.

165
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.960
I signed two new clients
before breakfast.

166
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.760
Good morning. Patricia. Morning.

167
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.200
Thank you very much.

168
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.800
Any messages?
On your desk.

169
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.640
Can you call the florist for me?
Oh. boy. What'd you do now?

170
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.600
Send roses. Two dozen.
That bad. huh?

171
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.760
Mr Ellis needs Carson's file.
It wasn't on your desk.

172
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.320
I've got it right here.

173
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.320
I think I found a loophole
for the non-competes.

174
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.240
A loophole that could win the case?

175
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.320
We wouldn't even have
to go to trial.

176
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.000
Carson's son let it slip.
He's adopted.

177
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.920
And if I find the right precedent.

178
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.080
he could form the company independently.

179
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.960
And then Carson can finally kick
his partner to the kerb.

180
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.600
Bingo.
You gonna pitch it to Ellis?

181
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.880
Just gonna grab the file.

182
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.080
HE SIGHS

183
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.440
After reviewing it this morning.

184
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.360
Christina must have
accidentally taken it.

185
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.840
Then you better get it.
Ellis is due in court in an hour.

186
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.840
HE SIGHS

187
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.280
Come on in. Sorry about the mess.

188
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.000
So. there's two bedrooms. You can
have the bigger one. if you want.

189
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.160
It looks like
you've barely moved in.

190
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.280
I like your couch.

191
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.880
I'm in the process.
Tonight's my first night.

192
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.960
Let's see.
What else can I tell you?

193
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.400
There is a laundry facility
in the building.

194
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.880
And a gym.
A gym? Perfect.

195
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.200
I could use it
for my personal training clients.

196
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.640
So you like it?

197
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.760
Well. I mean.
it could use a little personality.

198
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.000
Maybe some art.

199
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.600
I have a really big painting
that would look great over there

200
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.240
and another one right over here.

201
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.920
One that would be perfect there.

202
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.080
And there. maybe some wallpaper.

203
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.720
How do you feel
about decorative pillows?

204
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.960
Um...
Oh.

205
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.800
Sorry.
We haven't made this official.

206
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.400
If you need more time...

207
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.040
When can you move in?

208
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.080
SHE SQUEALS

209
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.400
Thank you!
I've been looking for a while.

210
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.960
You wouldn't believe
how many weirdos are out there.

211
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.640
Um. actually I would.
PHONE CHIMES

212
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.680
Oh. no. Oh.
Bad news?

213
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.280
Er. yeah.
I think I have a file my dad needs.

214
00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.400
There it is. Damn.

215
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.920
His office is downtown.
and I have class in 20 minutes.

216
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.400
I can take it to him.
I have the day free.

217
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.000
I can't ask you to do that.

218
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.920
I'm offering. You just helped me out
in a really big way.

219
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.760
Listen.

220
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.960
Today's the anniversary
of losing my father.

221
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.400
And...
Oh. I'm so sorry.

222
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.320
No. it's OK. It happened
a long time ago. I was a kid.

223
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.000
But when the date comes up.
I like to stay busy.

224
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.360
It helps. you know.

225
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.240
Of course. I mean. thank you.

226
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.320
I'll text you the address. Great.

Hello. I'm here to see Noah Davis.
Your name?

229
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.840
Alyssa Winters.
His daughter. Christina. sent me.

230
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.840
I'm sorry. Christina sent you?

231
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.480
Yes.
She said her father needed this.

232
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.520
Oh. thanks. I'll give it to him.

233
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.200
I told Christina I would
give it to him. personally.

234
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.080
I'm Mr Davis's assistant.

235
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.560
Then you can show me to his office.
Follow me.

236
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.600
Noah. someone to see you.

237
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.760
Mr Davis?
Can I help you?

238
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.680
I'm Alyssa.
Christina's new roommate.

239
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.320
She said you needed this.

240
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.960
Her new roommate?

241
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.520
As of 30 minutes ago.

242
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.520
Christina had a class. so I offered
to bring over the file.

243
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.200
Well. thank you.
That's very generous.

244
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.560
My pleasure.

245
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.640
This is a really nice office.

246
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.720
You must be the best attorney
they have.

247
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.280
Second best!
Peter Buchanan. And you are?

248
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.640
You should stop by for dinner.
You and your wife.

249
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.160
Once Christina and I get settled.
Of course.

250
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.240
Well. I'll get out of your hair.
It was really nice meeting you.

251
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.000
Likewise. um... Alyssa.

252
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.920
Right. Thanks again for the files.

253
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.160
HE EXHALES
Who's that?

254
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.160
That's Christina's new roommate.
And she's inviting you to dinner.

255
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.280
Morning. Mr Ellis. Morning.

256
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.040
If you're heading to the courthouse.
I can give you a ride.

257
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.240
Thank you. Peter.
Patricia said you wanted to see me.

258
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.800
Yes. sir.
It's about the Carson case.

259
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.520
Peter. why don't you head down
and bring the car around?

260
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.960
This'll just take a moment. Mm.

261
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.400
I think I've found a loophole
for the non-competes.

262
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.080
RECORD CRACKLES

Ta-da!

265
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.520
Oh. I love that.

266
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.360
{\an8}I promised myself I would never
eat Chinese food ever again.

267
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.120
{\an8}but here I am.
in my brand-new apartment...

268
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.400
Well. you really went all out.
didn't you?

269
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.600
I promised I wouldn't.
but I can't help myself.

270
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.120
So. what did you decide?

271
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.600
About what?

272
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.880
About the bakery.

273
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.920
Did you talk to Noah?
You said you were ready.

274
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.160
We've barely had time
to talk about anything.

275
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.600
If we're not working.
we're wining and dining his clients.

276
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.840
so I guess it'll have to wait.

277
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.120
Why does it have to wait?

278
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.080
I have a friend
in commercial real estate.

279
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.120
I can get you a list of properties.
SHE SCOFFS

280
00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.440
I couldn't ask you to do that.

281
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.200
Liz. you were there for me
when my wife died.

282
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.720
I couldn't have made it through
without you. Please.

283
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.640
Let me just return the favour.

284
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.600
You already are.

285
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.840
I couldn't have made it
through the last couple of weeks

286
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.040
without your help.

287
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.080
NOAH CLEARS THROAT

288
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.160
Christina will be so pleased.

289
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.120
Thought the party
wasn't for another hour.

290
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.200
Uh. Liz needed some help setting up. So...

291
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.680
Sweetie. why don't you go inside
and get ready for the party?

292
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.840
KNOCK ON DOOR
Can I come in?

293
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.240
Sure.

294
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.800
You're not dressed for the party.

295
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.440
I'm not feeling up to it.

296
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.160
Are you OK?

297
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.320
I was unpacking.
and I found some old photos.

298
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.800
Of my ex.

299
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.520
I wasn't completely honest
when I said I was over him.

300
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.160
Did he cheat on you?

301
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.280
He cheated on his wife.

302
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.000
So he was married.
I didn't know.

303
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.960
Doctors
don't always wear their rings.

304
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.440
He was a doctor
and you were a volunteer?

305
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.120
That doesn't sound fair.

306
00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.240
When I found out the truth.
I finally broke it off.

307
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.800
He lost it and filed
a harassment claim with HR.

308
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.200
Hey. you know what?

309
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.400
The best way to get over him
is to get back out there.

310
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.800
Marcus is bringing his roommate
to the party tonight.

311
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.840
He is very cute.

312
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.000
I don't know.

313
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.920
You said you need a fresh start. right?

314
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.880
Come on. It'll be fun.

Hey.

Hey. guys.
This is my new roommate. Alyssa.

How you doing? Marcus Jackson.
This is my roommate. Craig Porter.

Hey. I know you.
I saw you at registration this week.

You're a nurse. right?
I'm just a volunteer.

325
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.200
OK. Well. uh. I'm just a doctor.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.160
Oh.
Bad joke?

327
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.640
Yeah.

328
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.000
I mean. you have something
against doctors?

329
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.920
Not at all.

330
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.000
OK. Well. um. how about
we get some coffee sometime?

331
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.280
I don't think so.

332
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.880
Eee. nice.

333
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.200
I'm an idiot. Her ex was a doctor.
and it did not end well.

334
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.680
Just let me talk to her.
Nah. it's...

335
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.920
Don't worry about it. man.
She's new. It's OK.

336
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.240
All right.

337
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.080

Hey. birthday girl.

Oh. honey. Do you know
if any of these have peanuts?

341
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.280
Oh. right. Your allergy.
Give me a minute and I'll check.

Thanks. Well. hi. Alyssa.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.200
Hi. Christina and I
were having a conversation.

344
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.360
and you're interrupting.

345
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.560
Well. I'm... I'm sorry.
No. it's fine.

346
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.040
Um. just give us a second.

347
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.560
Absolutely.
Alyssa...

348
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.760
I should have told you
Craig was a doctor.

349
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.040
I wasn't thinking. Clearly.

350
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.200
But he's a great guy.

351
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.280
Don't judge him just because...
It's too soon.

352
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.800
OK. I thought you understood.
Can we please just drop it?

Leaving?

355
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.200
I shouldn't have come.
I'm not in the party mood.

356
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.000
I know how you feel.

357
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.600
What are you drinking?

358
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.520
Scotch. You want one?

359
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.440
Yeah.

360
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.040
Thanks again for bringing that file.
It was a big help.

361
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.600
So... how's the place coming along?

362
00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.440
Well. our upstairs neighbour
stomps around like Bigfoot.

363
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.160
But otherwise. it's good.

364
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.600
You planning on taking us up
on that dinner invite?

365
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.080
Your wife has. Twice.

you're up for managing partner.

368
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.000
Yeah. It's between me
and another colleague.

369
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.200
Tell me it's not that sleazy guy

370
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.600
who couldn't stop staring
at my ass.

371
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.760
Actually. it is.

372
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.320
Can you beat him?
He likes to play dirty.

373
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.120
My advice... don't be like that.

374
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.440
I believe if you work hard.
you should get what you deserve.

375
00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.920
Doesn't always work that way.

Big client got arrested last night.

So. Andrew sends his regrets.
but he won't make the party.

We're working on the brief
for the judge right now.

I know. but...

Andrew is really impressed
with my work so far.

384

Is everything OK?

Yeah. I've just. uh...

387
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.880
Just got to head back
into the office.

You bought them before the party.

No. I didn't.

Why don't you understand
the pressure that I'm under?

424
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.760
I asked you for one night. Noah.
For our daughter.

425
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.480
Christina knows what's at stake.
And she believes in me.

426
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.200
I believe in you!

427
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.840
You believe in Sam.
What?

428
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.880
You cheer him on
with whatever he does.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.400
And I show up late for dinner.
and you give me hell.

That is not true.
I have always supported you.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.280
Honey. if I have ever made you
feel otherwise. I'm sorry.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.240
Support goes both ways. Noah.

433
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.640
I want to open a bakery.

She left with Marcus.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.600
I was almost home when I realised
I was missing an earring.

445
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.080
My dad gave me these.
and they mean a lot. so...

446
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.800
I shouldn't have barged in.
I'm sorry.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.000
No. no. That's... That's OK.

Those are beautiful.

449
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.480
Yeah. that's what I was hoping
Liz would say.

450
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.200
You would have been here
if you could.

451
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.040
And you told Christina
you'd make it up to her.

452
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.280

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.800
Perfect.

458
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.680
Would you. um.
give these to Christina for me?

459
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.400
Of course.

460
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.880
And. um... Here. Ah...

461
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.880
No. thank you for trying to help
with the party today.

462
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.160

left your party.

I'll be right back.

Mm. Smells so good.
My compliments to the chef.

Oh. look. Here. In your hair.
Thank you.

473
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.960
I'm starving.

474
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.560
Well. uh. let's eat.
Where's Mom?

475
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.040
She had a rush order to fill.

476
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.320
Pretty soon she's gonna have to open
her own bakery.

477
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.800
Dad. she could have ten bakeries.

478
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.160
none of it matters if she thinks
you don't support her.

479
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.040
Fine. What's your advice?

480
00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.520
All she's ever wanted
is to spend more time with you.

481
00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.080
And you know what she loves doing
almost as much as baking?

482
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.640
No. Anything but that.

483
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.680
My mom has been begging him
to go running with her.

484
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.160
but he is always finding excuses.

485
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.520
What is running gonna fix?

486
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.640
It's a romantic gesture.
Way better than flowers.

487
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.240
OK. Well. I'm not exactly
in the best shape. so...

488
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.520
All you have to do
is rebuild your stamina.

489
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.840
Alyssa's a personal trainer.
She can help you get back in shape.

490
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.240
I don't know.
It'll be easy.

491
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.120

492
00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.800
We'll start early.
so it doesn't interfere with work.

493
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.960
Come on. For Mom.

494
00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.640
OK. How hard could it be?

495
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.400
Pace yourself.

496
00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.800
Noah.
Yeah.

497
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.400
Maybe we should take a break.
I'm good.

498
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.040
You don't wanna hurt yourself.

499
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.960
OK. We're stopping.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.800
You weren't kidding when you said
you were out of shape.

501
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.400
And I thought I was getting faster.

502
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.120
We've only been training
a couple of days.

503
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.960
We'll get there.

504
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.320
Well... I need to get faster.

505
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.200
Easy. tiger.

506
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.680
Running with your wife
isn't likely to fix your marriage.

507
00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.040
But you're a good guy for trying.
Maybe Liz is right.

508
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.280
She mentioned seeing a therapist.

509
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.720
My parents did.
Yeah? Did it help?

510
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.400
It made things worse. Great.

511
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.440
I was relieved
when they got a divorce.

512
00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.200
Ah. I don't want a divorce.
I love my wife.

513
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.280
My dad loved my mom.

514
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.160
He tried so hard.
but nothing was ever good enough.

515
00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.640
She couldn't see how perfect he was.
So she left him.

516
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.800
Eventually. he found someone else.
Someone better.

517
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.960
He was finally happy.

518
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.160
You deserve to be happy. too.

519
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.080
I got a busy day.
I should get to the office.

520
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.720
Noah. wait.

521
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.600
Oh. your lunch is here.

522
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.920
I didn't order anything.

523
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.200
The delivery guy said
it was for you.

524
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.960
From who?
Something about a promotion?

525
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.640
I mean. Patricia.

526
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.560
you are always sticking
your business cards

527
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.200
in these "win a free lunch" bowls.

528
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.160
True.
But this is Chinese chicken salad.

529
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.560
I can't eat this.

530
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.360
Here. you take it.
I already ate.

531
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.400
But it says "no peanuts"
on the receipt.

532
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.200
Huh. It does.

533
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.120
Well. who said there's
no such thing as a free lunch?

534
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.240
OK. We got everything done.
I can't believe it.

535
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.200
I think this was
your biggest sales day yet.

536
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.040
It felt like it.

537
00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.880
Hey. What if I were
to loan you the money?

538
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.440
I couldn't ask you to do that.

539
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.880
No. I could underwrite the business
till you're ready to take it over.

540
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.640
That's very kind of you. Sam.

541
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.880
Well.
I believe in what you're doing.

542
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.440
I can tell you have talent.
And that shouldn't be stifled.

543
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.720
Just think about it. that's all.

544
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.480
I will. Great.

545
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.040
Hey. Noah.
Thank you. Patricia.

546
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.200
Are you feeling OK?
I don't know.

547
00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.120
Maybe I'm coming down
with something.

548
00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.480
All right. Why don't you go home?
Get some rest.

549
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.600
Yeah.

550
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.960
Patricia! Somebody get help!

551
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.160
Call 911!

552
00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.360
Hang in there. Patricia.

553
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.360
Noah. hold her head.
Is she allergic to anything?

554
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.640
Peanuts.
Does anyone have an EpiPen?

555
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.240
{\an8}I think she has one in her purse.
Go get it.

556
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.200
{\an8}Her pulse is racing.

557
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.640
{\an8}Airway is closed.
She's going into anaphylactic shock.

558
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.400
{\an8}Hold her head back.
I have to try to open up her airway.

559
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.680
Patricia?

560
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.120
Here you go.
Hold on. Patricia.

561
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.920
{\an8}You're gonna be OK.

562
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.400
Noah.

563
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.480
Noah.
Liz.

564
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.360
I called the office and heard about
Patricia. How is she?

565
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.520
She's. uh... She's OK.

566
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.960
Oh. thank goodness. How are you?

567
00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.920
We haven't really spoken
since the party.

568
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.960
Liz. I can't get into this
right now.

569
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.280
Yeah. Do you still want me to join
you for your client dinner tonight?

570
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.640
It got rescheduled.

571
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.800
OK. I'll see you at home?
We'll talk then.

572
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.440
OK.

573
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.520
You're still here?
How is she?

574
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.320
The doctors say she'll be fine.

575
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.360
How'd you know how to do that?

576
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.680
I volunteer with children.

577
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.160
Kids are in hospital all the time
with allergic reactions.

578
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.200
Patricia is so careful.
I should sue that restaurant.

579
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.720
I'm sure it was just an accident.

580
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.560
That's no excuse. She could have
been killed if you weren't here.

581
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.120
Why are you here?

582
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.960
I wanted to apologise
for this morning. I overstepped.

583
00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.640
Well. I should call
Patricia's husband and...

584
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.320
I need to get somebody
to cover the desk.

585
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.760
I can do it.

586
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.520
I can just call my temp agency

587
00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.600
and have them assign me here
for as long as you need.

588
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.640
Is there anything you can't do?

589
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.360
I updated your calendar
for the rest of the week.

590
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.920
Thank you.

591
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.720
You seem to be burring the candle
at both ends.

592
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.320
You didn't even touch your lunch.

593
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.680
I am so sorry. I should have sent
you home hours ago.

594
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.480
Do you like Chinese?

595
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.000
Huh.

596
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.400
Wow. Thank you for this.

597
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.360
I didn't even realise
how hungry I was.

598
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.760
Need me to prepare anything
for tomorrow?

599
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:58.720
Uh. no. We can go over it
on our run tomorrow.

600
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.960
Thought I scared you off.

601
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.360
I didn't want you to be right.

602
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.040
I think I'm avoiding going home
cos I...

603
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.680
I just can't talk to Liz.

604
00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.600
and this idea
of a romantic gesture...

605
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.360
HE SIGHS

606
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.520
I don't know. Maybe I'm just
delaying the inevitable.

607
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.440
At least you can say
you went down fighting.

608
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.480
My ex never even tried
to fight for us.

609
00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.000
I thought he was the perfect guy.

610
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.240
No such thing.

611
00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.440
If you don't want to go home.
I could get you a hotel room.

612
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.080
I heard the Walden's nice.

613
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.960
A room at the Walden is tempting.
but. uh...

614
00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.000
I should go home.

615
00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.320
Liz'll probably be asleep. anyways.
Don't worry. I'll clean this up.

616
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.640
OK.

617
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.120
Um. you think you could stay on
for a few more days?

618
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.240
Patricia should be back
by the end of the week.

619
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.640
So soon?

620
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.880
They're releasing her
from the hospital tomorrow.

621
00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.280
I'll be happy to cover for her.

622
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.320
Thank you.

623
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.360
My pleasure.

624
00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.200
DOOR CREAKS

625
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.440
MONITOR BEEPS STEADILY

626
00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040
Alyssa?

627
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.400
I didn't know the volunteers
worked this late.

628
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.520
Well. the kids are here 24-7.

629
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.280
Some have trouble sleeping.
so I keep them company.

630
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.960
Oh. so you work
on the children's ward?

631
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.720
What are you doing on this floor?

632
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.200
Coffee break. Care to join?

633
00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.600
I thought you hated doctors.

634
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.120
SHE CHUCKLES
I was rude at the party.

635
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.880
Christina said
you're worth getting to know.

636
00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.200
Well. my shift ends
in about ten minutes.

637
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.960
I'll meet you at the cafe next door?
Sure.

638
00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.480
Oh. hey.
What did you tell him about my ex?

639
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.760
What?

640
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.720
He knew I moved here
to get away from Jason.

641
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.520
Did you tell him that
Jason was married. too?

642
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.880
Who?
Craig. I just had coffee with him.

643
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.640
I only said it was a bad break-up.

644
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.480
Well. you shouldn't
have said anything.

645
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.560
You're right. I'm sorry.
Did you tell him my dad died. too?

646
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.880
What? No.

647
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.040
That I was just a child
when I lost him?

648
00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.160
Alyssa. I'm so sorry.
Don't feel bad for me.

649
00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.840
I don't need that.
I need you to listen. OK?

650
00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.120
I told you I wasn't ready.

651
00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.640
And now I have to go on a date
with Craig

652
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.360
so he doesn't twist things
at the hospital

653
00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.800
and tell people I'm damaged goods.

654
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.240
He would never do that.
Don't! You've done enough.

655
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.360
Alyssa.

656
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.720
Patricia. Hi. How are you feeling?

657
00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.000
I'm fine.

658
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.040
I really appreciate you
covering for me.

659
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.520
but I'm back now.

660
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.280
You don't have to be here.

661
00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.080
Oh. I know. I just wanted
to hear the announcement.

662
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.680
I'm really proud of Noah.

663
00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.960
I know I worked for him
for only a few days. but...

664
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.560
He's a great guy.

665
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.000
Yep. He is.

666
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.040
GLASS CLINKS

667
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.880
Jackson and Ellis is a firm
built on loyalty and integrity.

668
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.840
so when it came to choosing
a new managing partner.

669
00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.600
we went with someone
who gives tirelessly.

670
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.480
time and time again.

671
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:51.400
So. it is my great honour
to congratulate our new partner...

672
00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.840
Peter Buchanan.

673
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.800
APPLAUSE.
HE LAUGHS

674
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.360
WHISPERED EXCHANGE

675
00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.080
Andrew!

676
00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.600
Andrew. I respect your decision.
but I'm a little confused.

677
00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.000
If it wasn't for me. we would have
lost our biggest client

678
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.680
to another firm.
You left Carson vulnerable.

679
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.120
Did you even bother to figure out

680
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.720
who the biological father
of his adopted son was?

681
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.560
What does that even matter. sir?

682
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.400
It was his partner.
Carson's wife had an affair.

683
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.000
So you did know.
His son told me.

684
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.720
And what if this son
has a change of heart

685
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.640
and hands the company over
to his biological father?

686
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.360
Carson is aware of the risks.
There shouldn't be any risk.

687
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.360
Peter made sure of that
when he revised the contract.

688
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.360
We have to protect
our clients. Noah.

689
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.040
Even from themselves.

690
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.520
I knew I should have
come back sooner.

691
00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.400
How the hell did Peter know
about the paternity?

692
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.840
I saw Peter at the hospital
when you were in there.

693
00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.840
What? You're not suggesting
that I somehow told him?

694
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.920
Noah...
Patricia. I know you would never.

695
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.920
I wasn't accusing you.

696
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.480
I just meant it was weird
he was there so late.

697
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.120
But I never saw him.

698
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.560
That's because he wasn't visiting.
Excuse me.

699
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.280
Yeah. We'll celebrate this weekend.

700
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.480
Yeah.

701
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.440
I need to call you back.
How'd you know about the affair?

702
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.160
Carson's maid drives a hard bargain.

703
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.840
But you had to be sure. So you stole
his son's medical records.

704
00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.760
I protected this firm. You didn't.

705
00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.440
By putting Patricia in the hospital
so you had a reason to be there?

706
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.040
Now you're just reaching.
It's done. Noah.

707
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.000
Andrew made his choice.
Deal with it.

708
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.760
DIAL TONE

709
00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.240
Yeah. Sorry. hun.

710
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.720
I know. I know.
It's exciting. isn't it?

711
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.840
Peter couldn't have gotten
the records alone.

712
00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.720
He was working with someone
at the hospital.

713
00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.400
Even if he was. we can't prove it.

714
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.560
He's right. It's done.

715
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.480
Oh. I wasn't expecting you.

716
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.200
I didn't get the promotion.
What? Oh. no. I'm sorry.

717
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
I can't stay at that firm. Liz.

718
00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.880
Not after this.
I'll set up my own.

719
00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.520
Honey. I know you're upset.

720
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.440
but it's not worth throwing away
your entire career.

721
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.800
You've worked too hard.

722
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.960
Why can't you just be on my side?

723
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.240
I am on your side.

724
00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.440
Look. starting a business
isn't that simple.

725
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.520
I submitted a proposal to the bank
for my bakery

726
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.800
and they rejected it.

727
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.240
If it wasn't for Sam...
Sam?

728
00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.840
Yeah.

729
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.600
He offered to advance me the money.

730
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.680
Why would he do that. Liz?

731
00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.040
Because we're friends.

732
00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.440
You weren't expecting me?

733
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.600
I guess you're cooking for him now?

734
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.320
I wanted to thank him.
Are you sleeping with him?

735
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.560
SHE SCOFFS

736
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.040
That's what you think?

737
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.440
SHE STUTTERS
That I'm cheating on you?

738
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.240
Get out.

739
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.640
All righty. Mr Davis.
You're all checked-in

740
00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.480
for one night
in our presidential suite.

741
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.480
I'll go ahead
and call my bellman for your bags.

742
00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.200
I don't have any bags.
Where's the bar?

743
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.960
It's gonna be right over there. Thanks.

744
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.000
What are you drinking?

745
00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.520
How'd you find me?

746
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.320
Figured you'd avoid going home
and take my offer up on the hotel.

747
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.320
I was wrong when I told you
not to fight dirty.

748
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.600
I could never do what he did.

749
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.600
Of course not. You're a good guy.
You're perfect.

750
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.160
If the firm can't see that.
they don't deserve you.

751
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.000
What he did... If it got out...

752
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.480
...it could ruin the firm.

753
00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.280
I made that place what it is.
It's my legacy.

754
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.320
How can I just turn a blind eye?

755
00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.560
What's that?

756
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.920
Security footage from the hospital.

757
00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.880
What?
I was right.

758
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.960
Peter bribed one of the doctors.

759
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.600
How did you get... Look...

760
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.280
It's better if you don't know.

761
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.640
That's the only copy.
I deleted the original.

762
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.960
Alyssa. you...
You shouldn't have done that.

763
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.720
How else do you expect to start
your own firm?

764
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.920
It's not like your boss
would let you keep your clients

765
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.360
without any leverage.

766
00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:24.720
No. Liz is right. I'd be throwing
everything away if I left.

767
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.080
So then stay.

768
00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.000
And take back your promotion.

769
00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.200
You deserve to be happy.

770
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.760
Morning.

771
00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.160
Noah. it's OK.

772
00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.360
No. I shouldn't have done this.

773
00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.560
It's what you needed.

774
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.800
To feel valued. wanted...

775
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.400
No. Alyssa. I...

776
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.800
I can't do this.
You don't need to say anything.

777
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.640
I know what this was.

778
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.160
You really are the perfect guy.

779
00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.040
PHONE CHIMES

780
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.920
'Noah. I didn't want
to do this over the phone.

781
00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.920
'I'm not having an affair.

782
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.320
'Please come home
so we can talk about it.'

783
00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.800
Good morning.
What are you doing home?

784
00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.760
I just had brunch with my mom.
Just grabbing my books.

785
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.960
Oh. How is she?

786
00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.880
Fine. Somebody's in a good mood.

787
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.560
As a matter of fact. I am.

788
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.360
You didn't come home last night.
You're wearing yesterday's clothes.

789
00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.000
Did you hook up with Craig?

790
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.320
Sorry. I'm staying out of it.
I'm staying out of it. But. did you?

791
00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.600
Guilty.
SHE GIGGLES

792
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.480
Details.
OK.

793
00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.640
He was amazing. Perfect. Really.

794
00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.720
I'm so happy for you guys.
We should get drinks.

795
00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.200
It's not even lunch time.

796
00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.640
Tonight. Is Craig working?

797
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.480
I'm not sure. I can ask him.
I can text him.

798
00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.880
Christina. I can manage my own life. Thanks.

799
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.560
I mean. I'm heading to the hospital
anyway. so I'll ask him. OK?

800
00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.440
Alyssa!

801
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.720
ENGINE STARTS UP

802
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.360
Scotch. Neat.

803
00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.960
So...
You waiting for someone?

804
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.080
Are you?

805
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.200
My wife and I have an understanding.

806
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.680
Does she know that?

807
00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:11.200
HE CHUCKLES

808
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.920
Wine.
Wine not!

809
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.160
She's not answering my texts.

810
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.080
Craig.
she said she'd be here. right?

811
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.560
Yeah.
Well. then stop worrying.

812
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.360
She lives here. She'll be here.

813
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.480
Now that Patricia's back.
you can be my secretary.

814
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.600
Mm. Administrative assistant.

815
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.840
Whatever.

816
00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.360
So. do you feel guilty.
stealing that promotion?

817
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.240
I didn't steal anything.
It's just business.

818
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.480
Got to play to win.
Like chess.

819
00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.680
He takes your knight.
You take his bishop.

820
00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.920
Something like that.

821
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.400
You're cute.

822
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.760
Then all is fair.

823
00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.480
You wanna get out of here?

824
00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.640
Maybe.

825
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.720
What do I have to do
to make that a yes?

826
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.600
Can I borrow your phone?

827
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.520
Mine's dead.
and I should let my roommate know

828
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.800
I probably won't be home tonight.

829
00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.240
Barkeep.
HE CLEARS THROAT

830
00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.000
Close it out.

831
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.160
You wanna ride with me?

832
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.720
I have my own car.

833
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.480
All you have to do is follow me.

834
00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.720
HORN BLARES

835
00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.160
ENGINE REVS

836
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.960
You trying to get away from me?

837
00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.120
HORN BLARES

838
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.160
TYRES SCREECH

839
00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.400
DOOR UNLOCKS

840
00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.280
Sorry I'm late.
I had this thing for work.

841
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.080
Wow. You look... Incredible.

842
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.840
Thanks. I need a drink.

843
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.400
We finished the wine.
No. there's more in the kitchen.

844
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.160
I'll get it.
No. I got it.

845
00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.440
I'm gonna marry that girl.
That's just the sex talking.

846
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.920
I can't believe you guys
already hooked up.

847
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.240
So racy.
She told you?

848
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.920
She couldn't stop smiling
this morning.

849
00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.160
She really likes you.

850
00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.560
Yeah. she practically
ripped my clothes off.

851
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.840
We're gonna make
beautiful babies together.

852
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.120
I like a woman
that can plan my future.

853
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.960
Andrew. Glad you stopped by.
We need to talk.

854
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.160
Peter was in a car accident
last night.

855
00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.720
What? Is he OK?

856
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.480
Funeral arrangements are being made.

857
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.000
What the hell happened?

858
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.000
His blood alcohol level
was over the limit.

859
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.080
and. apparently. there was something
he couldn't live with.

860
00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.600
You mean. he killed himself?

861
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.040
I don't know. he. uh...

862
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.880
He texted me. er. saying his
conscience got the better of him

863
00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.640
and that he didn't want
the promotion

864
00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.120
if it was based on a lie.

865
00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.960
That doesn't sound like him.
I think he got spooked by someone.

866
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.880
I just received this by courier.

867
00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.960
It's footage of Peter sneaking out
of the hospital.

868
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.760
Now. on its own. it's nothing.

869
00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.440
but if the doctor he paid
to get those medical records

870
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.480
comes forward...

871
00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.920
The firm could be held culpable.

872
00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.520
Noah. uh. we need you.

873
00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:51.040
You think this is how
I wanted the promotion? By default?

874
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.000

As a matter of fact. I have.

I'm sorry.

Well. that's what I wanted

Can we do dinner tonight?
Christina said you cook now.

886
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.640

Hi. babe.

893
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.000
There's a cute breakfast stop
that's nearby.

894
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.200
I thought you said
there was one copy.

895

USB drive. Alyssa.

897
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.800
You sent another copy to Andrew

898
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.360
when I told you
I didn't wanna use it.

899
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.520
Then tell him what I did.

900
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.400
You can't. can you?
Because you know I'm right.

901

Are there any more?
No. I swear.

902
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:51.080
Is what I did so bad?
You can have whatever you want now.

903
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:54.720
I told Andrew I would handle it.
Who was working with Peter?

904
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.680
Don't worry. I took care of it.

905
00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.640
My mom and I have run
so many miles here.

906
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.640
Go easy on me. I didn't grow up
running marathons.

907
00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.520
Race you to the stairs. Go!
Wait. what?

908
00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.840
Oh. please don't hate me.
I did this for you. For us.

909
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.240
What are you talking about?
Dad!

910
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.400

What is going on?

911
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.440
We didn't wanna hurt you.

Alyssa.

914
00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.240
It's not like that.
It just happened.

915
00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.840
How could you do this to Mom?

916
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.720
No. don't touch me.
You're disgusting.

917

Show some respect.

OK. You're being immature.

920
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.840
Besides. I signed a lease.

921
00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.240
Noah. you're a lawyer.
Could you please weigh in on...

922
00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.840
OK. OK. Enough.

923
00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.120
You're defending her?
HE SIGHS

Come on. come on. come on.
Who are you?

925
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.520
Christina!

926
00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.600

stay here tonight.

I'll get you a room here. OK?

931
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.320
I can just stay with you.

932
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.440
That's not happening.

933
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.040
You're just worried
your wife will find out.

934
00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.720
Noah. she probably already knows.
HE SIGHS

935
00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.320
I don't want to hurt her
any more than I already have.

936

But you have to.

937
00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.320
It's the only way
we can be together.

938
00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.360
We could get a place of our own.

939
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.760
We barely know each other.
But we love each other.

Babe. what are we doing?
Looking for answers.

942
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:56.360
Look. I know you're upset.
but we shouldn't be in here.

943
00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.240
I have to figure out who she is.
By invading her privacy?

944
00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.480
She seduced my father.

945
00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.320
And that's not the first time
she's gone after a married man.

946
00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.520
Wait. What?

947
00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.560
Who's this?
Her ex.

948
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.120
If I can figure out who he is.
maybe he can tell me more about her.

949
00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.720
Looks like he's my dad's age.
I guess she does have a type.

950
00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.480
He knew I moved here
to get away from Jason.

951
00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.280
Did you tell him that Jason
was married. too?

952
00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.280
And I know his name.

953
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.800
Christina. what are you doing?

954
00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:35.680
Searching doctors named Jason
in Texas.

955
00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.080
It's a needle in a haystack.

956
00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.360
I know.
There's thousands of them.

957
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.800
KNOCK ON DOOR
Christina?

958
00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:49.080
I don't wanna talk to him.
Just give him a chance.

959
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.640
KNOCK ON DOOR
Honey. please.

Not long.

Are you... in love with her?

963
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.760
It's not about love.

964
00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.920
Alyssa's... It's different.

965
00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.720
And I know I've no right
to ask you this...

966
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.640
I'm not gonna lie to Mom for you.

967
00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:26.240
No. No. I don't want you to.

968
00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:29.680
Just... give me time
to tell her myself.

969
00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.760
Are you getting a divorce?

970
00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.520
Sweetheart.
you've never been married.

971
00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.560
What is that supposed to mean?

972
00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.120
You don't understand the sacrifices
that you have to make.

973
00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.960
I'm sorry we made your life
so miserable.

974
00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.120
Honey...

975
00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.160
I love you.

976
00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:52.000
And I love your mother. but we were
so young when we had you.

977
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.960
Younger than you are now.

978
00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.760
Get out.

979
00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.880
Christina.
I said get out.

982
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:56.320
Yeah. I had six orders come in
last minute. Back-to-back.

983
00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.280
You need some help?

984
00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.400
Sure. Stir that.

985
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.800
OK.

986
00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.480
You know.
I heard the news about Peter.

987
00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:11.720
It was just awful.
Yeah. Can't believe he's gone.

988
00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.920
I was thinking. tomorrow. I could
bring some food over to his wife.

989
00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.880
Yeah.
I'm sure she'd appreciate that.

990
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.240
I can't imagine what
she's going through right now.

991
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.320
Noah. if that had been you...

992
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:31.840
What's wrong?

993
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:37.640
Nothing. I'm just glad to be home.

994
00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.480
Here you go.

995
00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:54.840
Wow. You really can cook.

996
00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.520
You don't remember?

997
00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.520
When Christina was born.
you were so overwhelmed

998
00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.160
that I literally had
to learn to cook.

999
00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.600
I remember never sleeping.

1000
00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.040
Kind of like right now.
with the business taking off.

1001
00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.960
I bet you're loving
every minute of it.

1002
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.600
Just like when Christina was born.

1003
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:13.000
Honestly. it's a dream come true.

1004
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.520
And I should have considered that
before shooting down yours.

1005
00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.800
Whatever you wanna do.
I believe in you.

1006
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.560
Um. so. I talked to Andrew.

1007
00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.120
I told him I could start
my own firm.

1008
00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.000
But he agreed that
I'd already built one.

1009
00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.360
He's giving you the promotion.

1010
00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.400
Yeah.

1016
01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.680
Yeah. Just a little bit
of whipped cream for me.

1017
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.320
There you go.

You want another slice?

1020
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.240
You can never make too much of them.
More coffee?

1021
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.720
Nah. it's getting late.
I should probably go.

1022
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.400
Oh. You're going back?

1023
01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.160
Yeah.
Why?

1024
01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.400
I think we should take it slow.

1025
01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.160
But... I'll come back tomorrow
and cook for you. OK?

1026
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.040
OK. But. Noah. I... Tomorrow.

1027
01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.200
I love you.
I love you. too.

I saw you with her.

1032
01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.600
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1033
01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.200
I saw you with your wife.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You followed me?
Are you going back to her?

1035
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.480
You don't have the right to ask me
anything about my wife.

1036
01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.640
She doesn't care about you.

1037
01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:06.520
Not like I do.
No. You should go.

1038
01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.360
So. that's it?
You got what you wanted.

1039
01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.440
And now you're just going to go back
to a job you hate and a wife...

1040
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.760
Don't say another word.

1041
01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.040
Your marriage is over. Noah.
No. Alyssa. This is.

1042
01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.920
She has a right to know.
Are you threatening me?

1043
01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.280
Let go of me!

1044
01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.880
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

1045
01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:35.480
You're a liar.
And Liz has a right to know.

1046
01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.960
Ow!
Don't touch me.

1047
01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.800
Mom?

1048
01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.920
Oh. sweetie.

1049
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.320
Thank you for coming by so late.

1050
01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.800
Listen.

1051
01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.200
I wanted to let you know.
I saw your father today.

1052
01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.440
Are you OK?

1053
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.000
That's a stupid question. I'm sorry.
How could you be.

1054
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.520
No. I'm fine. It was nice.
What?

1055
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.920
Yeah. He made dinner.
It was pretty good. too.

1056
01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.760
And did you talk about anything?

1057
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.920
We talked about lots of things.

1058
01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.400
We both know
we've made some mistakes.

1059
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.680
But I think we're ready
to move forward now.

1060
01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.680
That's all?
Oh. and he kissed me.

1061
01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.000
Listen to me.
I sound like a schoolgirl.

1062
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.360
Sweetie. I thought you'd be happy.
I am happy.

1063
01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.240
Honey. as a future attorney.

1064
01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.160
you're gonna need
a better poker face.

1065
01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.960
Mom. I don't know how to say this.

1066
01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.480
Just say it.

1067
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.520
Liz.
Noah. what are you doing here?

1068
01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.480
You're bleeding. What happened?

1069
01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.480
You told her?
I didn't say anything.

1070
01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.040
What's going on?

1071
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.760
One of you please say something.

1072
01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.760
Christina. I think you should leave.
I'm staying here for Mom.

1073
01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.400
What is going on?

1074
01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.120
Dad...

1075
01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.320
I slept with someone.
What?

1076
01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.120
Who?

1077
01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.640
Alyssa.

1078
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.120
Your roommate?

1079
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.840
She was helping me to start training
to run again. with you.

1080
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.480
And then Patricia got sick.

1081
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.240
and she started helping out
around the office and...

1082
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.840
The rest just happened.
It was just one time.

1083
01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.320
You knew?
Mom. I'm so sorry.

1084
01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.680
Liz. it's not her fault.

1085
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.200
I wanted to be the one to tell you.

1086
01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.520
Liz. please. I love you.
SHE SCOFFS

1087
01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.960
I can't live without you. Liz.

1088
01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.160
Please... I'm sorry.

1089
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.720
Did she do that to your neck?

1090
01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.960
Were you with her
before you came here?

1091
01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.760
I can't even look at you.

1092
01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.280
I told Alyssa it's over.

1093
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.760
So. she didn't take it well?
No.

1094
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.760
You must hate me.

1095
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.280
I don't hate you.
You're my father.

1096
01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.880
But you can't even look at me.

1097
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.760
I see you as a person who's flawed.

1098
01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.600
I was always your hero.

1099
01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.160
I know.

1100
01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.160
What are you going to do about Mom?

1101
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.320
I know I have no right
to ask her for a second chance.

1102
01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.720
but I won't stop trying.

1103
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.120
I can't.

1104
01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.320
You better go.

1105
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.920
Yeah. OK.

1106
01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.120
HE GROANS

1107
01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.040
I love you.

1108
01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.280
Alyssa!

1109
01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.280
'Texas Memorial. Bingo.'

1110
01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.040
She moved out.

1111
01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.800
So they're staying together
at the hotel. I guess.

1112
01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.640
He says he broke it off.

1113
01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.600
Does he love her?
Mom...

1114
01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.520
They just met.
It was only one night.

1115
01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.720
It's not love.

1116
01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.440
None of this
would ever have happened

1117
01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.200
if I didn't get an apartment.
Please don't blame yourself.

1118
01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.440
He made his choice.

1119
01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.600
He made a mistake.
Don't do that.

1120
01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.360
Don't take his side.
I won't.

1121
01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.480
Not after the way he hurt you.
but I know he still loves you.

1122
01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.840
Even if you never forgive him.

1123
01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.440
I'm sorry. I have to go. Mom...

1124
01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.600
FOOTSTEPS RECEDING

1125
01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.640
SHE GRUNTS

1126
01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:21.240
Mom? Mom!

1127
01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.480
Mom! Mom!

1128
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.240
Help! Somebody help us!

1129
01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.240
Help!

1130
01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.800
SIREN WAILS

1131
01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.040
Where's Liz?

1132
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.120
She's in surgery now.
There's nothing you can do but wait.

1133
01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.280
I was in court.
I got here as quick as I could.

1134
01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.400
Do they know who did this?

1135
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.280
Police think it was a robbery.
Her purse was stolen.

1136
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.920
OK. Were there any witnesses?
No.

1137
01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.240
Do you know anyone
who'd want to harm Liz?

1138
01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:04.120
No.
Are you sure?

1139
01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.320
I said no. Where's Christina?

1140
01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.480
I sent her home to change.
She was covered in Liz's blood.

1141
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.200
Now you're telling my daughter
what to do?

1142
01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.360
Noah. this is not the time
or the place.

1143
01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.880
Your wife could die.

1144
01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.200
MY wife. Exactly.

1145
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.520
Is it done?
Yeah.

1146
01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.360
We had a deal. right?
Depends.

1147
01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.000
On what?
If she's dead.

1148
01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:50.960
No. You told me. if I stabbed her.
you would delete the footage.

1149
01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.800
You know what our deal was.

1150
01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.960
You're the one
who made a deal. Craig.

1151
01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.960
You sold private medical information
to that scumbag lawyer. Peter.

1152
01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.360
Because of you. Noah didn't get
the promotion he deserved.

1153
01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.440
You caused my family
a lot of trouble.

1154
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.600
What?

1155
01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.880
Your family? What are you talking...
Shut up!

1156
01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.800
God. you're so annoying.

1157
01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.520
Who found the security footage
before the cops?

1158
01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.000
So you're not gonna
delete the footage?

1159
01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.280
You know what? You're insane.

1160
01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:33.800
You know that?
You started this. Craig.

1161
01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.040
Not me.

1162
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.760
Well. guess what. Alyssa.

1163
01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.720
The wound wasn't fatal.

1164
01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.160
I'm a doctor.

1165
01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.400
Not a killer.

1166
01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.320
But don't worry.

1167
01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.040
I planted the knife in your car.
So you can rot in hell.

1168
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
MONITOR BEEPS STEADILY

1169
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.960
SHE GROANS
Hey. Hey. hey. hey.

1170
01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.640
What are you doing here?

1171
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.360
You're my wife.

1172
01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.800
I'm gonna get you some water.

1173
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.600
I heard about Liz. Is she OK?
I was...

1174
01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.080
You did this. didn't you?

1175
01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.800
I would never do something
like that.

1176
01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.000
Besides. I couldn't have.

1177
01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:43.280
I was at the obstetrician.
What are you talking about?

1178
01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.400
You're gonna be a father again. Noah.

1179
01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.520
I know.
I couldn't believe it either.

1180
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.600
It was only a few days.
No. No.

1181
01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.920
You're lying. and you need to leave. Now.

1182
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.600
But I wanna be here for you.

1183
01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.080
I know you have to take care of Liz.
and that's OK. I'm here to help.

1184
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.520
You are insane if you think
there's a future. Alyssa.

1185
01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.120
We do. Noah.
We're having a baby.

1186
01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.720
That is impossible. It was one time.
and it was a few days ago.

1187
01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.000
And you know that.

1188
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.200
I thought so. too.
but then I took a blood test.

1189
01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.200
and it turns out that...

1190
01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.360
Stop.

1191
01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:28.320
Ignoring this won't make it go away.
You have a responsibility.

1192
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.600
The only responsibility I have
is to my wife.

1193
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.400
You can't abandon your baby.
We're a family now. Noah.

1194
01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:36.440
All of us!
Liz.

1195

PHONE CHIMES

1196
01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.080
Dr Allers.
That photo you sent me.

1197
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.200
Was it recent?
Yes. it was.

1198
01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.280
All right. You need to contact
Detective Deckard immediately.

1199
01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.440
Your lives are in danger.
Her name is Victoria Daniels.

1200
01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.840
She killed my wife.
What?

1201
01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.080
I'm gonna give you
Detective Deckard's direct line.

1202
01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.120
Let me see if I can find his card.
Oh. my God.

1203
01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.320
I regret they day I ever met her.

1204
01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.080
When I broke it off.
she couldn't handle it.

1205
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.680
Kept going on and on about
how we were perfect for each other.

1206
01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.360
And then. Victoria vanished.
Nobody could find her.

1207
01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.560
Not until now.

1208
01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.640
I've seen her driver's license.
it says Alyssa Winters.

1209
01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.520
Victoria was smart.

1210
01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.880
She would have changed her identity
or stolen it from someone.

1211
01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.040
Wait. I think I remember an article
about a missing woman in Texas.

1212
01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.000
'I'm gonna send you a photo
of Detective Deckard's card.'

1213
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.720
You have to call him immediately.

1214
01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.800
Victoria will destroy your entire
family to get what she wants.

1215
01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.200
just like she destroyed mine.

1216
01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.760
Thanks.

1217
01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:47.280
Alyssa Winters.
She was found dead in her apartment.

1218
01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.880
Police suspect foul play.
What?

1219
01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:07.640
Got to take your pain meds.
Leave them on the table and go.

1220
01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.600
Liz. can we talk. please?

1221
01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.520
You wanna talk?

1222
01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.840
Why don't you tell me
how you could sleep with a girl

1223
01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.560
who's young enough
to be your daughter?

1224
01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.520
I was at a low point.

1225
01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.240
I was watching you and Sam
get closer.

1226
01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.400
while we were drifting
further apart.

1227
01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.720
And ever since Christina was born...

1228
01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.240
Don't you dare
bring Christina into this.

1229
01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.640
Please.

1230
01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.400
I have nothing but love
for Christina.

1231
01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.520
And you. too.
with your competitive nature

1232
01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.160
and the way you talk to each other
in your own shorthand.

1233
01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.040
It's a bond I've seen grow
since she was born.

1234
01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.200
So. then. what?

1235
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.160
It's you.

1236
01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.560
And me.

1237
01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.520
I just...
I felt so disconnected from you.

1238
01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.160
Since she was born.

1239
01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.480
Wow. That long?
It's not always.

1240
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.600
But sometimes.

1241
01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.920
And I made...

1242
01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.080
...a really big mistake.

1243
01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.840
And I got drunk.
and I wasn't thinking.

1244
01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:32.520
And by no means
is that an excuse...

1245
01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.320
...but it was just the one night.
and I would do anything...

1246
01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.720
if I could take it all back.

1247
01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.880
I am so angry.

1248
01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.760
All I wanna do is hate you.

1249
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.360
I can't.

1250
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.520
I don't want us to be disconnected.

1251
01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.120
I'm not gonna ask you to forgive me.

1252
01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.960
Not until I've done...

1253
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.800
...everything I can
to make you trust me again.

1254
01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.640
OK?

1255
01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.680
Will you go make me some lunch?

1256
01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.120
Yeah.

1257
01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.680
FOOTSTEPS RECEDING

1258
01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.120
My dad's not answering.

1259
01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.400
He always answers when I call.
Marcus. I'm scared.

1260
01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.560
HE SCOFFS

1261
01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.840
Came to see Liz.

1262
01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.520
I'd appreciate it if you got
the hell out of my house. Sam.

1263
01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:53.440
Look. I know you think I'm trying
to break up your marriage...

1264
01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.040
...but I never stood a chance.

1265
01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.480
But you wanted one. right?
But that doesn't matter.

1266
01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.920
She'll always choose you.

1267
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.920
DOOR OPENS.
DOOR CLOSES

1268
01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.200
PHONE VIBRATES

1269
01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.680
PHONE VIBRATES

1270
01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.400
He's still not answering.
Something's wrong.

1271
01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.000
{\an8}Call the police.
then try him again.

1272
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.320
BLENDER WHIRRS

1273
01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.040
SHE GRUNTS

1274
01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.840
Mom?

1275
01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.160
SHE GASPS.
SHE SCREAMS

1276
01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.600
You're weak.

1277
01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.720
SHE SCREAMS

1278
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.440
Noah!

1279
01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:37.120
Did she hurt you?
It's just cuts on my hands.

1280
01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.640
Stay down!

1281
01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.240
Christina. stop.

1282
01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.920
She's pregnant.
Are you?

1283
01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.760
Alyssa. tell the truth.

1284
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.160
I'm not.

1285
01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.320
I just... I...
SHE WHIMPERS

1286
01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.080
I just wanted to be loved.

1287
01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.920
Everyone deserves to be loved.

1288
01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.440
Right?

1289
01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:29.120
Thank you.
Mr Davis. I'm Detective Harris.

1290
01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.240
I'm glad you're OK.

1291
01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.720
I just spoke with Detective Deckard
about Miss Daniels.

1292
01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:36.400
We also believe we've found the man
who stabbed you. Mrs Davis.

1293
01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.640
Who was he?

1294
01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.720
His name was Craig Porter.
He was a doctor.

1295
01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:41.840
His body was in the trunk
of Alyssa's car.

1296
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.480
We don't have all the details.

1297
01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.840
but can you think of any reason
why he would target your family?

1298
01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:50.360
No. Craig was our friend.

1299
01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.200
He was dating Alyssa.
Wait. Did you say he was a doctor?

1300
01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.680
Yeah. I did. Why?

1301
01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:59.080
I think he attacked Liz
because Alyssa was blackmailing him.

1302
01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:02.280
Blackmailing?
Let's talk.

1303
01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.640
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1304
01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.080
We should celebrate.

1305
01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.520
We are celebrating.

1306
01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.840
I mean tonight.

1307
01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.400
I'll cook. Deal.

1308
01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.920
All's well that ends well. Yeah.

1309
01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.160
I'm happy for them.

1310
01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.840
Race you to the sugar cookies.

1311
01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.760
Oh. really? You think I'm gonna...
Go!
