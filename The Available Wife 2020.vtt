on the charts again?

362
00:15:47.555 --> 00:15:50.166
- I mean. if it
makes sense to us.

363
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.560
but I think my music
speaks for itself.

364
00:15:52.603 --> 00:15:53.735
- That's what I like to hear.

365
00:15:53.778 --> 00:15:55.258
I'd like to make every label

366
00:15:55.302 --> 00:15:57.347
that never signed you regret it.

367
00:15:57.391 --> 00:15:59.828
- So let's get right to it.

368
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:02.309
We got the hottest song
in hiphop right now.

369
00:16:02.352 --> 00:16:04.964
What's the benefit of him
signing to this label?

370
00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:06.139
I mean. I already
got them 100 grand

371
00:16:06.182 --> 00:16:07.792
just for shows last month.

372
00:16:07.836 --> 00:16:09.794
Shit. I got him 10 bands
for a walk through.

373
00:16:09.838 --> 00:16:11.231
- Yeah. that's what I'm saying.

374
00:16:11.274 --> 00:16:12.188
[chuckles]

375
00:16:12.232 --> 00:16:13.624
- 10 Bands?

376
00:16:13.668 --> 00:16:14.756
Wow.

377
00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:16.627
[laughs]

378
00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:17.672
That's cute.

379
00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:23.460
What I'm talking about is
turning bands into M's.

380
00:16:23.504 --> 00:16:24.940
Do you know how to
book the garden.

381
00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:28.770
without the ice removal fees.
the night before a show?

382
00:16:28.813 --> 00:16:30.859
Or how to collect
foreign royalties

383
00:16:30.902 --> 00:16:35.646
from streaming platforms
you've never even heard of.

384
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.909
I didn't think so.

385
00:16:37.953 --> 00:16:40.521
We don't just talk. we deliver.

386
00:16:42.479 --> 00:16:45.482
- So. Drew. where
did we leave off?

387
00:16:45.526 --> 00:16:47.789
- We were just going over
procedures and the next steps

388
00:16:47.832 --> 00:16:49.312
to bringing Kingston on board.

389
00:16:49.356 --> 00:16:51.749
- Good. I'm hoping
we have a deal?

390
00:16:51.793 --> 00:16:53.229
- We just need a few more days.

391
00:16:53.273 --> 00:16:55.927
Walter has been working
extremely hard to getting him.

392
00:16:55.971 --> 00:16:59.061
out of his preexisting
contract for Artism.

393
00:16:59.105 --> 00:17:00.149
- Nice.

394
00:17:00.193 --> 00:17:01.759
[chuckles]

395
00:17:01.803 --> 00:17:05.067
Apparently we have
found our jewel.

396
00:17:05.111 --> 00:17:08.505
Let's make this deal happen
as soon as we can. okay?

397
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:09.985
There's money to be made.

398
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.292
- [Meghan] Absolutely
- Okay?

399
00:17:12.335 --> 00:17:13.858
- I'd like to
raise your platform

400
00:17:13.902 --> 00:17:18.341
so that we can make
magic and money together.

401
00:17:18.385 --> 00:17:19.255
- I think I got a
couple of tricks

402
00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:21.823
up my sleeve I could show you.

403
00:17:21.866 --> 00:17:24.173
- Let's get to work
guys. [clears throat]

404
00:17:24.217 --> 00:17:25.044
You ready?

405
00:17:25.087 --> 00:17:25.870
- Mm-hmm.

406
00:17:25.914 --> 00:17:26.741
- Okay.

407
00:17:28.264 --> 00:17:29.091
Thank you.

408
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:33.052
Now!

409
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:37.926
[phone rings]

410
00:17:37.969 --> 00:17:39.101
- Let's give Kingston
full access to our studio

411
00:17:39.145 --> 00:17:41.756
and access to every
producer on our roster.

412
00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:43.888
I wanna create something
with him immediately.

413
00:17:43.932 --> 00:17:45.499
Keep him invested.

414
00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:47.196
Let me know when he's
in the studio. okay?

415
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.067
- Done.

416
00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:54.421
[vehicles hum]

417
00:17:57.946 --> 00:18:00.340
[door opens]

418
00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:02.255
- Ms. Cole.

419
00:18:02.298 --> 00:18:03.473
- Mr. Raymond.

420
00:18:04.344 --> 00:18:06.389
- I wasn't expecting you.

421
00:18:06.433 --> 00:18:08.217
- You filed a cease and
desist order against me

422
00:18:08.261 --> 00:18:09.740
claiming harassments.

423
00:18:09.784 --> 00:18:11.829
- Oh well. that was
just a little. you know.

424
00:18:11.873 --> 00:18:14.223
pro formal. legal
response to your claim.

425
00:18:14.267 --> 00:18:18.532
I had to do a little response
on behalf of my client.

426
00:18:18.575 --> 00:18:21.056
- It's not right. your client
Nicole Wright is a thief.

427
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.710
and God knows whatever else.

428
00:18:22.753 --> 00:18:27.106
- My client claims that the
company was given to her

429
00:18:29.673 --> 00:18:32.372
before the death of your
father. may he rest in peace.

430
00:18:32.415 --> 00:18:36.463
Therefore. rightfully
and legally. it's hers.

431
00:18:36.506 --> 00:18:38.900
- My father worked his
ass off for this company

432
00:18:38.943 --> 00:18:40.336
and it doesn't belong
to Nicole Wright

433
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.816
or no one else over there.

434
00:18:41.859 --> 00:18:44.688
I'm gonna get it back.
one way or another.

435
00:18:44.732 --> 00:18:47.517
- And you should know
that Nicole Wright

436
00:18:47.561 --> 00:18:50.303
does not give up anything

437
00:18:50.346 --> 00:18:52.131
without a fight.

438
00:18:52.174 --> 00:18:54.524
- Walter. I've been
knowing you my whole life.

439
00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:57.266
I cannot believe you're
fighting me for her.

440
00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.443
- My darling Alecia.
my sweetheart.

441
00:19:00.487 --> 00:19:03.664
I will always be
your Uncle Walter.

442
00:19:03.707 --> 00:19:07.146
but I have to honor
your father's wishes.

443
00:19:08.321 --> 00:19:09.496
- You can't convince me

444
00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:11.759
my father just gave
his life works to her.

445
00:19:11.802 --> 00:19:14.457
This label is our legacy.

446
00:19:14.501 --> 00:19:16.459
What did she do to him?

447
00:19:16.503 --> 00:19:18.940
Does she have something on him?

448
00:19:18.983 --> 00:19:20.811
Or does she have
something on you?

449
00:19:20.855 --> 00:19:23.988
[soft music]

450
00:19:24.032 --> 00:19:24.859
- Hey.

451
00:19:27.514 --> 00:19:28.950
this is business.

452
00:19:30.343 --> 00:19:33.955
- Okay. Mr. Raymond. I'll
show you just business.

453
00:19:33.998 --> 00:19:36.653
[ominous music]

454
00:19:37.741 --> 00:19:40.353
[upbeat music]

455
00:19:48.926 --> 00:19:51.102
- Mike. thanks for taking
care of him so last minute.

456
00:19:51.146 --> 00:19:52.669
- No problem.

457
00:19:52.713 --> 00:19:54.105
[upbeat music]

458
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:56.020
- Whats up Ms. Wright?

459
00:19:56.064 --> 00:19:59.502
- Why the formalities.
call me Nicole.

460
00:19:59.546 --> 00:20:02.375
- All right Ms. Nicole.
what brings you by?

461
00:20:02.418 --> 00:20:04.115
- I am checking
on my investment.

462
00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:06.205
I think the deal is
going through tomorrow.

463
00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:07.597
- Okay. perfect.

464
00:20:07.641 --> 00:20:09.120
- It is.

465
00:20:09.164 --> 00:20:10.470
I'm really impressed at how
quickly you guys started.

466
00:20:10.513 --> 00:20:12.211
Is Mike getting you
settled in okay?

467
00:20:12.254 --> 00:20:13.516
- Yeah. I mean at this
point we're just looking

468
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.865
for the perfect hit.

469
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:17.172
- A hit. that is
just what we need.

470
00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.174
- All we need is a beat.

471
00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.045
- You know what they say. when
you're looking for something

472
00:20:21.089 --> 00:20:23.265
it could be looking for you.

473
00:20:23.309 --> 00:20:24.571
Listen to that.

474
00:20:25.528 --> 00:20:28.139
[upbeat music]

475
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.886
- Okay there Ms.
Nicole. I see you.

476
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.061
[laughs]

477
00:20:37.105 --> 00:20:38.585
Don't start something
I can't finish

478
00:20:38.628 --> 00:20:40.195
- I only finish what I like.

479
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.283
You like the beat?

480
00:20:41.327 --> 00:20:42.415
- Yeah. it's cool.

481
00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:44.373
[laughs]

482
00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:45.679
- All right cool.

483
00:20:45.722 --> 00:20:47.333
Well. play with
that a little bit

484
00:20:47.376 --> 00:20:50.249
and let me know what you think.

485
00:20:50.292 --> 00:20:51.075
Mike. you got this?

486
00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:51.902
- Got him.

487
00:20:51.946 --> 00:20:52.947
- Thank you.

488
00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:57.038
- We gonna play hard
for a little while.

489
00:20:57.081 --> 00:20:59.780
[dramatic music]

490
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:10.486
- What's going on?

491
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:11.966
It must be serious

492
00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:13.228
'cause you've been texting
me like crazy all day.

493
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:15.317
- Close the door. please.

494
00:21:16.449 --> 00:21:18.581
[door closes]

495
00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:22.237
I have here in my
possession. the original will

496
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:23.499
of Gerald Cole.

497
00:21:24.979 --> 00:21:28.069
His daughter is contesting
the forgery that we made

498
00:21:28.112 --> 00:21:29.549
and she was here this afternoon.

499
00:21:29.592 --> 00:21:30.854
- Wait. can she do that?

500
00:21:30.898 --> 00:21:31.986
That was over two years ago.

501
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:33.248
- Well. she doesn't believe

502
00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:36.425
that her father left
everything to you.

503
00:21:36.469 --> 00:21:37.948
- Does it matter
what she believes?

504
00:21:37.992 --> 00:21:39.950
- To me or to Gerald?

505
00:21:39.994 --> 00:21:40.821
Uh-uh.

506
00:21:43.389 --> 00:21:45.782
Come on baby. you owe me.

507
00:21:45.826 --> 00:21:47.218
[laughs]

508
00:21:47.262 --> 00:21:48.263
- I owe you?

509
00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:49.090
- Yeah.

510
00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:50.613
- If it wasn't for me.

511
00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:52.093
your ass would have been
replaced a long time ago.

512
00:21:52.136 --> 00:21:53.834
His family had ideas
for his company

513
00:21:53.877 --> 00:21:55.879
and it didn't involve you.

514
00:21:55.923 --> 00:21:57.141
- Well. you know what.

515
00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:58.969
at least we would've
still been in the black

516
00:21:59.013 --> 00:22:01.102
'cause you don't know what
the fuck you're doing. okay?

517
00:22:01.145 --> 00:22:03.452
Gerald Cole was a visionary.

518
00:22:04.932 --> 00:22:06.368
He was a genius.

519
00:22:06.412 --> 00:22:08.457
- He was a manipulator.

520
00:22:08.501 --> 00:22:10.633
And he had me and God
knows how many other women

521
00:22:10.677 --> 00:22:13.593
doing all types of heinous acts.

522
00:22:13.636 --> 00:22:16.117
- Well. you got the
best of it didn't you?

523
00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.946
I mean you're like. come on now.

524
00:22:18.989 --> 00:22:20.991
I heard you kinda liked it.

525
00:22:21.035 --> 00:22:22.210
I heard you kinda liked it.

526
00:22:22.253 --> 00:22:23.254
[laughs]

527
00:22:23.298 --> 00:22:24.125
- Walter.

528
00:22:24.168 --> 00:22:25.344
[laughs]

529
00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:27.433
- You kinda liked it.
didn't you Nicole?

530
00:22:27.476 --> 00:22:29.957
Come on baby. you
know what I mean?

531
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.526
I've spent just as much time
together as you and Gerald.

532
00:22:33.569 --> 00:22:38.095
I made you basically. I
made you bigger than Gerald.

533
00:22:38.139 --> 00:22:41.055
Look what I made you.
from what I understand.

534
00:22:41.098 --> 00:22:42.883
you were having sexual
intercourse with him.

535
00:22:42.926 --> 00:22:44.406
Fairly regularly.

536
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.800
So what I would like
to know about Nicole

537
00:22:46.843 --> 00:22:48.584
is why won't you fuck me?

538
00:22:48.628 --> 00:22:49.585
[screams]

539

something your mother would say?

want me to pursue my dreams
