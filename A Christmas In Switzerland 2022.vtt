- We got
the India job?

28
00:01:03.857 --> 00:01:05.539
- I just got
the call.

29
00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.101
We're about to build the most
fabulous boutique hotel

30
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.823
that Mumbai
as ever seen.

31
00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.665
- Yeah. baby!
Nice job!

32
00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:13.627
- Why. thank you.
thank you!

33
00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.268
Ha. And here is
your model back.

34
00:01:15.348 --> 00:01:17.831
- Ha! Thank you!

35
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.793
I told you. bringing this would
make all the difference.

36
00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:21.675
- Well. I think the schematic
would have been fine

37
00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:23.196
on their own.

38
00:01:23.276 --> 00:01:26.159
Nobody really uses
models anymore.

39
00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:28.361
- Looking at a design on
a computer is not the same thing

40
00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:29.963
as feeling it in your hands.

41
00:01:30.043 --> 00:01:33.326
A model conveys a sense
of depth. of texture.

42
00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:35.328
of dimension.

43
00:01:35.408 --> 00:01:37.330
You know how I feel
about this. Alex.

44
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.052
- I do. I do.

45
00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.214
Which is why I lovingly
sat on the plane

46
00:01:41.294 --> 00:01:44.217
with this in my lap
for twenty hours.

47
00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:46.339
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

48
00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:49.703
Oh! I also brought you a little
something back from Mumbai.

49
00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:51.344
- How thoughtful of you.

50
00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:53.426
- I can't have my partner
not having a souvenir

51
00:01:53.507 --> 00:01:55.749
from my most
exotic location.

52
00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.791
And it's all handmade.
- Ha!

53
00:01:57.871 --> 00:01:59.432
It's beautiful!

54
00:01:59.513 --> 00:02:01.635
I love it!
Thank you!

55
00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:03.276
- You're welcome.

56
00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.398
- Can you do lunch?
- You know
I would love to.

57
00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.040
but I'm super
pressed for time.

58
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.523
I leave again
in a few hours.

59
00:02:09.603 --> 00:02:12.045
- That's right. Christmas
in Switzerland this year!

60
00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:13.967
You jet-setter!
- Ha! I am
so exited!

61
00:02:14.047 --> 00:02:15.609
I can't wait
to see my family

62
00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.370
and spend the holidays
with them.

63
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.012
- I still can't believe
your mum decided

64
00:02:19.092 --> 00:02:20.654
to purchase an inn there.

65
00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:22.656
What even possessed her?

66
00:02:22.736 --> 00:02:24.898
- Well. you know. her parents
grew up in Switzerland.

67
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.419
so she still got a lot
of family there.

68
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.261
and I think
after my dad died.

69
00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:29.983
she was looking to reconnect
with her roots.

70
00:02:30.063 --> 00:02:32.305
- She's inspiring.

71
00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:35.188
- She always says never too late
to start a new adventure.

72
00:02:35.268 --> 00:02:38.471
- Haha! I can see
where you get it from!

73
00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:40.834
So. when's the big
grand opening of the inn?

74
00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:42.435
- Ha! It's gonna be
on New Year's Day.

75
00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:44.077
My mum said
she wanted to have

76
00:02:44.157 --> 00:02:46.119
the perfect family Christmas

77
00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.761
before the grand
opening. so...

78
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:49.362
Well. have a wonderful
Christmas!

79
00:02:49.442 --> 00:02:52.485
- You too.
Have such a great trip!

80
00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:54.087
- I will.

81
00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:56.369
Alright! I will see you
when I get back.

82
00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.011
- Have a safe flight!

83
00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:00.493
(♪♪♪)

84
00:03:00.574 --> 00:03:03.496
(train siren)

85
00:03:03.577 --> 00:03:06.419
<i>- Louis. have you thought</i>

86
00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.021
about the Swiss canapés?

87
00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:10.383
We need fresh salmon.
- Hmm. mum.

88
00:03:10.463 --> 00:03:12.826
- Salmon. rucola. cucumber...

89
00:03:12.906 --> 00:03:15.068
- Ha! Mum.
- Yes. what is it?

90
00:03:15.148 --> 00:03:16.710
- Ha! Did you
talk to Alex?

91
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.713
- About what?
- About Beth and Jesse.

92
00:03:19.793 --> 00:03:21.514
- Ha! They need
to mend fences.

93
00:03:21.595 --> 00:03:23.396
They've been best friends
since they were two.

94
00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:25.078
- I know. but it's
not that simple.

95
00:03:25.158 --> 00:03:27.440
Alex's best friend is now
in a relationship with her ex.

96
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.402
- I understand that.
but I need to help them mend.

97
00:03:29.482 --> 00:03:31.524
and bringing them together
is a good start.

98
00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:33.927
- Okay. If you think
that's a good idea.

99
00:03:34.007 --> 00:03:36.169
- Trust your mother.

100
00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.251
Louis. did you hear what
I said about the canapés?

101
00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:41.815

- Hum!

<i>Danke.</i>

106
00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:23.817

Get over here. you!

111
00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:44.958
- Ha!
- Oh! I missed you!

112
00:04:45.038 --> 00:04:47.400
- I missed you too. mum!
Good to see you!

113
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.562
- Hey. sis!
Long time no see!

114
00:04:49.643 --> 00:04:52.045
- Hey! Andy. how are you?

115
00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:55.048
Hi. Linds!
Good to see you!

116
00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.530
Oh. my Noah!
You're so big!

117
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.292
- Hey. aunt Alex.
- Hey. buddy!

118
00:04:59.372 --> 00:05:01.214
Wow. mum!

119
00:05:01.294 --> 00:05:02.936
Ha! Look at this!

120
00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:05.458
This is incredible!
- You think so? Ha!

121
00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:07.260
It's hard to believe
it's really happening.

122
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.183
- Oh! Mum.
it's beautiful.

123
00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:12.906
I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.
sweetheart.

124
00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:14.988
- You want me to show
you your room?

125
00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:18.031
- Wow! Such service.
- Well. maybe
if this whole

126
00:05:18.111 --> 00:05:19.713
Doctor's Without Borders
thing doesn't work out.

127
00:05:19.793 --> 00:05:21.875
I can ask mum for a job.

128
00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:24.037
- You know. you're always
welcome to work for me. son.

129
00:05:24.117 --> 00:05:26.079
You too. Linds.
- Hum! I think
I'll stick to doctoring.

130
00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.881
Thanks. Carol.
Haha!

131
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:29.803
- She's not very good
with customer service.
- Hey!

132
00:05:29.883 --> 00:05:32.365
- Alright. come on!
- Alright. Upstairs?

133
00:05:32.445 --> 00:05:34.007
- Yeah.
- Okay.

134
00:05:34.087 --> 00:05:35.929
- Ha!

135
00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.251
- I know. this is
going to be so fun!

136
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:41.414
(♪♪♪)

137
00:05:43.096 --> 00:05:44.898

<i>- Willkomme. meine Damen.</i>

139
00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:48.501
- Okay. where is my brother

140
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.983
and what did you
do with him?

141
00:05:50.063 --> 00:05:52.425
- Haha.

142
00:05:52.505 --> 00:05:53.907
- Look at this place!

143
00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:55.869
It's so Christmassy!
I love it!

144
00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.670
- Yeah. mum has done a really
good job with the place.

145
00:05:57.751 --> 00:05:59.392
-Yeah. How is
she doing?

146
00:05:59.472 --> 00:06:01.715
I know Christmas
without dad is tough.

147
00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:03.236
- She seems okay.

148
00:06:03.316 --> 00:06:05.238
I think buying this inn.
renovating it.

149
00:06:05.318 --> 00:06:06.880
it was really good
for her.

150
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.042
Yeah. At least.
it keeps her busy.

151
00:06:09.122 --> 00:06:11.084
- That and the thousands of
cousins she apparently has here.

152
00:06:11.164 --> 00:06:13.046
- Hahaha.

153
00:06:13.126 --> 00:06:16.249
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course! Of course!

154
00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:18.091
There's no way I'd miss
Christmas with all you guys.

155
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.854
-Yeah. It'll be nice to spend
the holidays together

156
00:06:20.934 --> 00:06:23.016
as a family.
- Yeah. it will be.

157
00:06:23.096 --> 00:06:24.657
(yawn)

158
00:06:24.738 --> 00:06:26.219
I'm sorry!

159
00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:28.221
- Get some rest.
you're probably jet lagged.

160
00:06:28.301 --> 00:06:30.824
- Nah! I'm fine.
- No. no. no.
take a nap.

161
00:06:30.904 --> 00:06:32.425
We'll scrounge up dinner
in a few hours

162
00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:34.667
and you can come down
whenever you want.
- Ha!

163
00:06:34.748 --> 00:06:36.509
I don't need a nap.

164
00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.112
I just need to. you know.
rest my eyes for a few minutes.

165
00:06:39.192 --> 00:06:41.714
It'll perk me
right up.
- Whatever you say.

166
00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:43.236
- Haha!

167
00:06:43.316 --> 00:06:44.717
Ha! Okay.

00:07:22.635 --> 00:07:24.878
(yawn)

179
00:07:30.563 --> 00:07:32.765
I think I'm gonna
like it here.

180
00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:44.097
- Oops!
- Ha!

181
00:07:44.177 --> 00:07:47.020
- Oh. my gosh. honey!
Are you okay?

182
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.182
- Yeah. yeah.
No. I'm fine. mum.

183
00:07:49.262 --> 00:07:51.024
- You need to be
more careful!

184
00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.226
Oh. my goodness!

185
00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.667
Oh!

186
00:07:54.747 --> 00:07:58.391
Sweetheart. this is Liam.
our general manager.

187
00:07:58.471 --> 00:08:00.834
He's the one who keeps this
place from catching on fire.

188
00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:02.795
and my family from going
to the hospital. Ha!

189
00:08:02.876 --> 00:08:05.999
- Oh! Hi. Liam.

190
00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:08.561
I'm Alex.
- Hi. Alex.

191
00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:11.324
So great to meet you.

192
00:08:11.404 --> 00:08:13.006
Your mum has told me
so much about you.

193
00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:16.089
- Ha! Likewise.
Hum!

194
00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:17.891
I heard about all
your hotel experience.

195
00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:19.572
I thought you'd
be a little...

196
00:08:19.652 --> 00:08:21.774
- Older.
- Yeah.

197
00:08:21.855 --> 00:08:24.017
- Yeah. I get that a lot.

198
00:08:24.097 --> 00:08:25.498
- Well. we were just about
to head into town

199
00:08:25.578 --> 00:08:27.180
to get some more things
for Christmas

200
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.222
and some decorations
for the opening.

201
00:08:29.302 --> 00:08:31.865
But there is a breakfast bread
in the dining room.

202
00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:33.626
so why don't you help yourself
to that and a cup of coffee.

203
00:08:33.706 --> 00:08:35.268
- Ha! I could really
use a cup of coffee.

204
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.870
<i>- Madame!</i>
Oh. excuse me!
- Louis.

205
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.352
- There's been a problem
with the wine we selected

206
00:08:39.432 --> 00:08:42.035
for the opening:
it's not good!
- Ha!

207
00:08:42.115 --> 00:08:45.278
<i>- Rank!</i> Unacceptable!

208
00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.880
I found a new vendor.

209
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.641
but you and I. we must
select a new wine list.

210
00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:50.843
- Ha! Well. can it wait
till this afternoon?

211
00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:52.445
I need to go into town.

212
00:08:52.525 --> 00:08:54.727
- I'm sorry. no.
we must order before noon

213
00:08:54.807 --> 00:08:57.170
if we want the shipment to
arrive on time for the opening.

214
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.771
- There's always
something.
- Hum!

215
00:08:58.851 --> 00:09:00.333
- Wait. would you be able
to go into town with Liam.

216
00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:01.814
so I can take care of this?

217
00:09:01.895 --> 00:09:04.497
- Oh! Yeah. sure.
no problem.
- Okay.

218
00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:06.139
- Oh. it's fine.
I can go by myself.

219
00:09:06.219 --> 00:09:08.541
- Nonsense. no! I mean.
they'll be a lot to carry

220
00:09:08.621 --> 00:09:10.143
and it'll be
quicker with two.

221
00:09:10.223 --> 00:09:11.985
- Yeah! Yeah.
it's totally fine.

222
00:09:12.065 --> 00:09:13.466
Ha! Do you have a car?

223
00:09:13.546 --> 00:09:15.989
- Actually. there are
no cars in Wengen.

224
00:09:16.069 --> 00:09:19.032
- Oh. really?
How you guys get around?

225
00:09:19.112 --> 00:09:22.435
- We walk. The shops are only
a few blocks from here.

226
00:09:22.515 --> 00:09:24.357
- Haha!
- Ha!

227
00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:26.599
Okay. then.
Lead the way.

228
00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:28.641
Bye. mum.
- Yeah.

229
00:09:28.721 --> 00:09:33.246
(♪♪♪)

230
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.853
- So. are you
from the States too?

231
00:09:40.934 --> 00:09:42.695
You don't sound very Swiss.

232
00:09:42.775 --> 00:09:44.737
- Actually. I was born
here in Wengen.

233
00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:47.420
- Ha! No way!

234
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.702
- Yeah. my dad took a job
in New York when I was nine.

235
00:09:49.782 --> 00:09:52.305
so I mostly grew up
around there.

236
00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:55.628
- Ha! And now.
you're back here.

237
00:09:55.708 --> 00:09:57.910
- Actually.
I just moved back.

238
00:09:57.991 --> 00:09:59.953
I was living
in Bern.
- Ha!

239
00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:01.955
- I was running
the Bern Palace Hotel.

240
00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:03.436
Ever heard of it?

241
00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:06.079
- Ha! Have I heard
of the most expensive hotel

242
00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:07.880
in all of Europe?

243
00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:11.764
Why. yes!
Yes. I have.

244
00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:13.246
I mean. no offence.

245
00:10:13.326 --> 00:10:16.849
but why are you here
working for my mum?

246
00:10:16.929 --> 00:10:20.013
You could be running some
of the best hotels in the world.

247
00:10:20.093 --> 00:10:21.734
- Your mum is
a top-notch boss.

248
00:10:21.814 --> 00:10:23.376
- Haha!

249
00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.058
- Plus. you know.
my parents are here

250
00:10:25.138 --> 00:10:26.819
and pretty much
all my extended family.

251
00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:29.742
So. I just wanted
to be close.

252
00:10:29.822 --> 00:10:31.224
- That's nice.

253
00:10:31.304 --> 00:10:32.825
(kid's voice)

254
00:10:32.905 --> 00:10:35.948
- Your mum tells me
that you build hotels?

255
00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:37.430
- I do. I do.

256
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.392
I'm an architect.

257
00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.075
- She said you live
in Chicago.

258
00:10:42.155 --> 00:10:44.957
Your mum. she talks
about you a lot.
- Haha!

259
00:10:45.038 --> 00:10:47.640
Well. my apartment
is in Chicago.

260
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.282
but I travel so much for work.
I'm hardly ever there.

261
00:10:49.362 --> 00:10:51.684
- Oh. we're here.

262
00:10:51.764 --> 00:10:53.366
- Oh!

263
00:10:53.446 --> 00:10:55.408
This is so charming!

264
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:58.411
- Charming? It's just a shop.

265
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.013
- It's charming.

266
00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:01.774
Everything in Switzerland
is charming.

267
00:11:01.854 --> 00:11:04.337
Haha.

268
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.224
So. what do you think we're
gonna need for the opening?

269
00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:13.466
- Honestly?

270
00:11:13.546 --> 00:11:16.749
I have no clue. I'm terrible
at this kind of thing.

271
00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:18.751
- What? I thought you were in
charge of the whole operation.

272
00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:21.394
- No. I'm good at financials.
making hiring decisions.

273
00:11:21.474 --> 00:11:23.316
but event planning.
aesthetics. no!

274
00:11:23.396 --> 00:11:25.198
No! We just don't
have the budget

275
00:11:25.278 --> 00:11:27.480
for event planner.

276
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.402
- Well. I mean.
I'm no event planner.

277
00:11:29.482 --> 00:11:32.685
but I do know a thing or two
about visuals.

278
00:11:32.765 --> 00:11:34.407
So. let's see.

279
00:11:34.487 --> 00:11:36.049
Ha! Here!

280
00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:37.730
What about green

281
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.413
and gold for the main colours.

282
00:11:40.493 --> 00:11:42.535
And then... Oh!

283
00:11:42.615 --> 00:11:45.058
Add a few accents of red!

284
00:11:45.138 --> 00:11:46.939
And. huh... ha!

285
00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:50.463
Some lights for dimension.

286
00:11:52.024 --> 00:11:53.866
Hmm!

287
00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:56.069
- Candles?

288
00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:58.151
- I like where your heads at!

289
00:11:58.231 --> 00:11:59.752
Alright. throw them in there.

290
00:11:59.832 --> 00:12:01.834
See. you're gonna
be just fine.

291
00:12:03.436 --> 00:12:06.479
(♪♪♪)

292
00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.682
I mean. we are gonna
need a lot of candles.

293
00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:12.085
Huh! Look at these
little guys!

294
00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:13.846
Those are cute!

295
00:12:13.926 --> 00:12:16.809
(♪♪♪)

296
00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:19.051
- So. how long are
you staying in Wengen?

297
00:12:19.132 --> 00:12:20.733
- About a week.

298
00:12:20.813 --> 00:12:22.695
Then I've gotta fly
back home to Chicago

299
00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:25.698
to prep a pitch in Australia
a couple of weeks after that.

300
00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:28.581
- That's a shame you're not
staying for the opening.
- Yeah.

301
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:30.543
- I'm sure you travel a lot.

302
00:12:30.623 --> 00:12:32.705
It must be hard to have
a personal life. no?

303
00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:34.387
- Well. yeah.

304
00:12:34.467 --> 00:12:36.149
I'm not really looking for that
right now anyways. so...

305
00:12:36.229 --> 00:12:38.351
- What about your friends
back home. though.

306
00:12:38.431 --> 00:12:39.952
don't you miss
seeing them?

307
00:12:40.032 --> 00:12:41.914
- Yeah. but. you know.
the nice thing about

308
00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:45.278
travelling all the time is
you get to make new friends

309
00:12:45.358 --> 00:12:47.360
wherever you go.

310
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:51.804
- Well. thank you again
for all your help.

311
00:12:51.884 --> 00:12:54.127
I must admit. I'm a
little out of my depth

312
00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:55.808
with this whole opening.

313
00:12:55.888 --> 00:12:57.370
- Yeah. anytime.

314
00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.852
Just say the word.
I'm happy to help.

315
00:12:59.932 --> 00:13:02.014
- Hum.
- Hum.

316
00:13:02.094 --> 00:13:04.617
Take that.
- Hum.

317
00:13:04.697 --> 00:13:06.179
- Hey. you guys!

318
00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:08.060
Oh! Rummikub.

319
00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:09.702
- Yeah. He's kicking
my butt.

320
00:13:09.782 --> 00:13:12.064
- You're not allowed
to say butt. dad.

321
00:13:12.145 --> 00:13:14.987
- I'm sorry. booty.
- Well. I get
next game.

322
00:13:15.067 --> 00:13:16.829
And warning. I'm good.

323
00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:18.791
- Ha. I remember.

324
00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:22.195
- Hey. where's Linds?
- Work emergency.

325
00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:24.237
She's talking someone through
a tonsillectomy in Madagascar.

326
00:13:24.317 --> 00:13:26.118
- Oh! Wow!

327
00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:28.281
Quite the life
you guys lead now.
- Huh. huh!

328
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:30.323
- Hey. how are you liking
Madagascar. Noah?

329
00:13:30.403 --> 00:13:33.085
- I love it! I'm in a whole
club about lemurs.

330
00:13:33.166 --> 00:13:34.567
- Really? Wow. pretty cool.

331
00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.849
- Yeah. it's quite
the adventure.

332
00:13:36.929 --> 00:13:38.491
- Never too late
to start one.

333
00:13:38.571 --> 00:13:40.052
- Wise words
from a wise woman.

334
00:13:40.132 --> 00:13:43.015
- Hahaha.

335
00:13:44.016 --> 00:13:46.018
Ha.

336
00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:54.547
Andy. what does
this mean?

337
00:13:54.627 --> 00:13:57.470
Your room
in Switzerland awaits.

338
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.832
Why would you write that?

339
00:13:59.912 --> 00:14:04.637
- Ha. Beth and her mum are
coming over for Christmas.

340
00:14:04.717 --> 00:14:07.840
Mum didn't tell you
yet. did she?

341
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.802
- No! No. mum did not tell me.

342
00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:11.364
Mum!

343
00:14:11.444 --> 00:14:13.286
- Huh. mum. you're...

344
00:14:13.366 --> 00:14:15.568
- I think we need another
case of de Pinot noir.

345
00:14:15.648 --> 00:14:19.051
- Mum. did you invite
Beth and her mum here

346
00:14:19.131 --> 00:14:20.693
for Christmas?
- Of course.
I did!

347
00:14:20.773 --> 00:14:22.295
Jesse has to work
over the holidays.

348
00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:24.497
and you know how hard things
have been for Nadine

349
00:14:24.577 --> 00:14:26.178
since the divorce.

350
00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:28.020
I thought it'll be
fun for them.

Christmas with them.

You and Beth were inseparable.

a long time ago.

Beth and Jesse live together.

It's gonna be a wonderful
Christmas. I promise you.

362
00:14:50.883 --> 00:14:53.125

to Beth in over a year.

526
00:22:10.963 --> 00:22:13.525
- That doesn't make it
any less true. Noah.

527
00:22:13.605 --> 00:22:15.728
It doesn't make it
any less true.
- I'm just saying.

528
00:22:15.808 --> 00:22:17.369
- Alright! Come on!

529
00:22:17.449 --> 00:22:19.331
- Ciao!
- Bye!

530
00:22:19.411 --> 00:22:21.934
(♪♪♪)

531
00:22:22.014 --> 00:22:24.016
- Do you know what we're
waiting for?

532
00:22:25.978 --> 00:22:27.379
- I guess we'll
have to see.

533
00:22:27.459 --> 00:22:29.461
It's going
to start soon.

534
00:22:30.582 --> 00:22:32.024
- Hey. Alex!
- Hey!

535
00:22:32.104 --> 00:22:33.746
- Sorry we're late.

536
00:22:33.826 --> 00:22:35.347
One of us gets nervous

537
00:22:35.427 --> 00:22:37.910
when he meets new people.
- Haha.
No worries.

538
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.431
Who's this handsome little guy?

539
00:22:39.511 --> 00:22:41.353
- Alex. this is
my son Kelby.

540
00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:43.355
Kelby. this is
my friend Alex.

541
00:22:43.435 --> 00:22:45.277
- Nice to
meet you!
- Ha! Yeah!

542
00:22:45.357 --> 00:22:47.279
- Her mum owns the inn
where I work.
- Hum!

543
00:22:47.359 --> 00:22:48.801
- And this is
her nephew Noah.

544
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:50.843
- Hi. Kelby.

545
00:22:50.923 --> 00:22:52.364
- Hi.

546
00:22:52.444 --> 00:22:53.846
(acclamations)

547
00:22:53.926 --> 00:22:55.768
(exclamations)

548
00:22:55.848 --> 00:22:58.290
- Oh. wow!
- Yeah!

549
00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.653
(♪♪♪)

550
00:23:01.734 --> 00:23:04.256
- Oh! Okay. so who are
these guys?

551
00:23:04.336 --> 00:23:05.978
- That is Samichlaus.

552
00:23:06.058 --> 00:23:07.699
It's like our
version of Santa.

553
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.541
In Swiss tradition.
his arrival marks

554
00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:11.623
the beginning of
the Christmas season.

555
00:23:11.703 --> 00:23:13.625
Well. it was actually
supposed to happen last week.

556
00:23:13.705 --> 00:23:16.108
but Santa Claus. well. he had
an emergency appendectomy.

557
00:23:16.188 --> 00:23:18.911
- Oh! Yikes!
- Ho! ho! ho!

558
00:23:18.991 --> 00:23:21.233
- And who's the
scary-looking guy?

559
00:23:21.313 --> 00:23:24.636
- Oh! That is Schmutzli!

560
00:23:24.716 --> 00:23:26.718
Santa's sinister sidekick!

561
00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:28.801
He's like the Swiss equivalent

562
00:23:28.881 --> 00:23:30.362
of getting coal
in your stocking.

563
00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:31.844
- Huhuh.
- But instead
of coal.

564
00:23:31.924 --> 00:23:33.685
he just chases you around
with a broom stick

565
00:23:33.766 --> 00:23:36.088
and knocks you
on the head!

566
00:23:36.168 --> 00:23:38.130
Obviously. we don't...
we don't do that anymore.
- Boop. boop!

567
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:39.892
- Boop. boop!
- Oh!

568
00:23:39.972 --> 00:23:41.533
Well. that's a good thing. Haha!

569
00:23:41.613 --> 00:23:43.295
- Samichlaus!

570
00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:44.817
(Samichlaus speaks in German.)

571
00:23:44.897 --> 00:23:47.099
- Thanks.
- Wow! Awesome!

572
00:23:47.179 --> 00:23:49.621
- You guys can go
wherever you want.

573
00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:52.544
- Let's go!

574
00:23:52.624 --> 00:23:54.626
- Can I pet the donkey?

575
00:23:56.388 --> 00:23:59.311
- So. I didn't know
you had a son.

576
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:01.393
Is your wife here too?

577
00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:04.957
- Ha! I'm not married.

578
00:24:05.037 --> 00:24:06.959
I mean I was.

579
00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:10.322
but my wife. she passed away
two years ago.

580
00:24:10.402 --> 00:24:13.485
- Oh! Sorry to hear that.

581
00:24:15.047 --> 00:24:16.648
- It's actually
the main reason

582
00:24:16.728 --> 00:24:18.290
that we moved back
here to Wengen.

583
00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.372
After my wife
she passed.

584
00:24:20.452 --> 00:24:22.294
I don't know. it just...

585
00:24:22.374 --> 00:24:24.616
it rocked Kelby's world so hard.

586
00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:26.218
Both of ours.

587
00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.180
It's just. uh...

588
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.982
I want him to be
with his family.

589
00:24:30.062 --> 00:24:33.105
find some sort
of stability.

590
00:24:33.185 --> 00:24:35.948
- Yeah. Yeah. it makes sense.

591
00:24:37.229 --> 00:24:40.312
Oh. here comes
Samichalus!
- Huhuh.

592
00:24:42.194 --> 00:24:43.675
Oh!
- Oh. oh! Oh!

593
00:24:43.755 --> 00:24:46.078
Thank you so much!
<i>- Danke.</i>

594
00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.921
- It looks delicious.

595
00:24:49.001 --> 00:24:51.443
(screams from Schmutzli
and the kids)

596
00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:53.525
I'm gonna go get Noah.
I'll be right back.

597
00:24:53.605 --> 00:24:55.607
- Okay.
- Noah!

598
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.052
- Be careful!

599
00:25:00.132 --> 00:25:02.734
(screams)

600
00:25:02.814 --> 00:25:04.857
- Seriously. how do I
make him stop?!

601
00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:06.618
- You can't.
- (Alex): Wooo!

602
00:25:06.698 --> 00:25:09.301
Wooo! Wooo!

603
00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:11.383
Go for the kids.
not me!

604
00:25:11.463 --> 00:25:14.226
- Watch out for Schmutzli!

605
00:25:14.306 --> 00:25:16.388
(♪♪♪)

606
00:25:20.712 --> 00:25:23.835
<i>- Eins. zweiz. drei.</i> eh?
I'm working on my German.

607
00:25:23.916 --> 00:25:25.637
- That's very good.
- What did you
just play?

608
00:25:25.717 --> 00:25:28.120
- Haha! Oh. that was
so much fun!

609
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.602
So close!
Alright!

610
00:25:30.682 --> 00:25:32.244
Hey. guys!
- Hey!

611
00:25:32.324 --> 00:25:33.765
- Hey.

612
00:25:33.845 --> 00:25:36.608
- Let's get
all this off.

613
00:25:36.688 --> 00:25:38.730
There we go!
Hat!
- Thank you.

614
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.812
Mum. dad. look!

615
00:25:42.414 --> 00:25:43.815
- Haha! Wow!
- Wow!

616
00:25:43.896 --> 00:25:45.337
- I met Samiclaus
and Schmutzli.

617
00:25:45.417 --> 00:25:47.459
and there was a donkey
with treats!

618
00:25:47.539 --> 00:25:50.983
And Schmutzli said he was
gonna hit me with his broom!
- Well. excuse me?

619
00:25:51.063 --> 00:25:53.025
- Don't worry. they don't
actually do that anymore.

620
00:25:53.105 --> 00:25:54.907
- Oh!

621
00:25:54.987 --> 00:25:56.708
- Oh. I didn't mean
to interrupt your game.

622
00:25:56.788 --> 00:25:58.991
- You're not. You should join.
we just started.

623
00:25:59.071 --> 00:26:02.554
- Uh. not... You know.
Rummikub is not really my thing.

624
00:26:02.634 --> 00:26:04.957
- What? I thought you said
you were really good at it.

625
00:26:05.037 --> 00:26:06.558
- Right. Yeah.

626
00:26:06.638 --> 00:26:08.040
Thanks for that.
Andy.
- That my place.

627
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.561
I gotta go put this guy
to bed anyways.

628
00:26:09.641 --> 00:26:11.083
- Mum. I don't
want to.

629
00:26:11.163 --> 00:26:12.644
- No. no. no.
come on. come one!

630
00:26:12.724 --> 00:26:14.246
It's way past
your bedtime.
- Let's go.

631
00:26:14.326 --> 00:26:15.887
- Let's go.

632
00:26:15.968 --> 00:26:18.330
- Sorry. buddy. I didn't mean
to keep you out too late.

633
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.492
- Sorry.
- Good night.

634
00:26:20.572 --> 00:26:22.814
- Why don't you
grab a seat.

635
00:26:22.894 --> 00:26:24.896
- Okay.

636
00:26:25.817 --> 00:26:27.899
So. where's mum
and Nadine?

637
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.582
- Oh. they're around
here somewhere.

638
00:26:30.662 --> 00:26:33.105
- Drinking mulled wine.
reminiscing about old times.

639
00:26:33.185 --> 00:26:34.586
-You get those two together.

640
00:26:34.666 --> 00:26:36.268
they're like two
giggling schoolgirls.

641
00:26:36.348 --> 00:26:37.789
- It's sweet. they've
been best friends

642
00:26:37.869 --> 00:26:39.551
since they were kids.

643
00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:41.073
It's nice they still
have each other.

644
00:26:41.153 --> 00:26:42.554
- Yeah.

645
00:26:42.634 --> 00:26:44.596
So. whose turn is it?

646
00:26:44.676 --> 00:26:47.479
- Oh. uh. it's mine.

647
00:26:53.205 --> 00:26:55.207
- Ha!

648
00:26:56.928 --> 00:26:59.611
Hmm.
- What do you think?

649
00:26:59.691 --> 00:27:01.493
- I think your plan
might be working.

650
00:27:01.573 --> 00:27:03.895
- Oh. I hope so.

651
00:27:03.976 --> 00:27:06.458
I don't see them
talking much.

652
00:27:06.538 --> 00:27:08.740
- It's a start.

653
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.382
You know. I never thought

654
00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:12.064
putting Beth and Alex
in a room together would work.

655
00:27:12.144 --> 00:27:14.987
but I give you credit
for pushing it.

656
00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:17.429
- I just hope
that's all it takes.
- Ha.

657
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.512
Ha.

658
00:27:22.594 --> 00:27:24.836
(ringing)

659
00:27:24.916 --> 00:27:26.358
- Hey. partner!
<i>- Hey. world traveller!</i>

660
00:27:26.438 --> 00:27:28.240
<i>I Just wanted to catch you</i>

661
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.761
<i>before it got too late</i>
<i>over there.</i>

662
00:27:29.841 --> 00:27:31.883
- Oh! It's fine.
I'm up late

663
00:27:31.963 --> 00:27:33.805
and I'm still adjusting
to the time anyway.

664
00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:35.727
How are things going
at the mothership?

665
00:27:35.807 --> 00:27:39.411
- Well. actually. an interesting
opportunity just came up.

666
00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:41.853
<i>- Oh! Really? Do tell.</i>

667
00:27:41.933 --> 00:27:43.935
- How would you feel
about pitching

668
00:27:44.016 --> 00:27:45.417
for a fishing lodge in Argentina

669
00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:46.938
right after Christmas?

670
00:27:47.019 --> 00:27:49.781
- Of course!
I'd love to!

671
00:27:49.861 --> 00:27:51.703
Well. are you sure you don't
wanna take it. though?

672
00:27:51.783 --> 00:27:54.226
I know. you know. you've been
wanting to go somewhere warm.

673
00:27:54.306 --> 00:27:56.068
- Nah. you take it.

674
00:27:56.148 --> 00:27:57.789
I know you've always wanted
to go to Argentina.

675
00:27:57.869 --> 00:28:00.952
<i>Besides. I have plenty</i>
<i>to catch up on here.</i>

676
00:28:01.033 --> 00:28:02.634
<i>Have fun!</i>
- Oh! Thank you. Maya.

677
00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:04.276
<i>- So. I'll send you</i>

678
00:28:04.356 --> 00:28:06.158
<i>the preliminary schematic</i>
<i>I came up with.</i>

679
00:28:06.238 --> 00:28:09.121
Oh! And I’m mailing you
some model-making materials.

680
00:28:09.201 --> 00:28:11.483
I wasn’t sure if they sold
that kind of stuff up there.

681
00:28:11.563 --> 00:28:14.286
- It'll be fine.
the schematics are all I need.

682
00:28:14.366 --> 00:28:16.488
- Alex. you know
how I feel about models.

683
00:28:16.568 --> 00:28:18.130
<i>- Yes. I know.</i>

684
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.252
I know: texture.
depth. yadi yada.

685
00:28:20.332 --> 00:28:21.893
Okay. fine. I'll build it.

686
00:28:21.973 --> 00:28:24.776
- Good. cause I had them
sent express

687
00:28:24.856 --> 00:28:26.298
<i>and you should be getting</i>
<i>them in two days.</i>

688
00:28:26.378 --> 00:28:27.819
- Of course you did!
Alright!

00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:30.462
Thank you. Maya!
Have a good Christmas. okay?

690
00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:33.185

691
00:28:33.265 --> 00:28:34.706

693
00:28:49.081 --> 00:28:51.083
Ha.

694
00:28:51.163 --> 00:28:53.085
Well. hello there!
- Hi. Alex.

695
00:28:53.165 --> 00:28:54.806
<i>Guten morgen.</i>

697
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.692
So. all this is
for the opening?
- Yeah.

698
00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:02.614
I thought maybe we could
do it outside. you know.

699
00:29:02.694 --> 00:29:04.496
That way we could do
some activities for the kids.

700
00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:07.058
We wouldn't have to worry
about space.
- Oh. yeah!

701
00:29:07.139 --> 00:29:09.221
That is an excellent idea.

702
00:29:09.301 --> 00:29:12.184
See. you know what you're doing.
you don't need my help.

703
00:29:12.264 --> 00:29:14.106
- Actually. I could
use your help

704
00:29:14.186 --> 00:29:15.587
for the pastry tasting
for the party.

705
00:29:15.667 --> 00:29:17.949
Honestly. I could
do it myself.

706
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:20.071
but I'm not very discerning
when it comes to bread.

707
00:29:20.152 --> 00:29:23.034
- Oh! Well. I will never
say no to food.
- Well. that is great

708
00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:27.279
because Louis has baked us
quite the spread.
- Fantastic.

709
00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:30.282
(♪♪♪)

710
00:29:30.362 --> 00:29:32.124
- Mmm! Mmm. mmm. mmm!

711
00:29:32.204 --> 00:29:33.605
Oh. my goodness!

712
00:29:33.685 --> 00:29:35.487
This is delicious.
What is this?

713
00:29:35.567 --> 00:29:37.169
- It's a <i>Baumstriezel.</i>

714
00:29:37.249 --> 00:29:38.810
Chimney cake.

715
00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.452
- Huhuh.
- It's my
specialty.

716
00:29:40.532 --> 00:29:42.454
- Oh! Well. I will just
be taking all of these

717
00:29:42.534 --> 00:29:43.975
for myself then.
thank you!

718
00:29:44.055 --> 00:29:45.577
- You gotta try
this <i>pain d’épice.</i>

719
00:29:45.657 --> 00:29:47.659
- Oh!

720
00:29:49.221 --> 00:29:50.702
Aw!

721
00:29:50.782 --> 00:29:54.266
Louis. you are a genius.

722
00:29:54.346 --> 00:29:56.148
- Oh! A genius. genius.
I don't know!

723
00:29:56.228 --> 00:29:57.949
Gifted perhaps.

724
00:29:58.029 --> 00:30:00.071
but a genius...

725
00:30:00.152 --> 00:30:01.713
Maybe!

726
00:30:01.793 --> 00:30:03.395
- He's amazing!

727
00:30:03.475 --> 00:30:05.036
- You know. here at the
Christmas market in Wengen.

728
00:30:05.116 --> 00:30:06.958
we have tons of delicious food
just like this.

729
00:30:07.038 --> 00:30:09.921
- Oh! A Christmas market!
Like the one in Chicago.

730
00:30:11.443 --> 00:30:13.165
- Well. actually they take
their cues from us.

731
00:30:13.245 --> 00:30:15.247
Here you can experience
the real thing.

732
00:30:15.327 --> 00:30:18.049
You... You wanna
go tonight?

733
00:30:18.129 --> 00:30:21.533
It's at the same park
we were the other night.

734
00:30:21.613 --> 00:30:23.695
Or you had too much
Swiss culture for one day?

735
00:30:23.775 --> 00:30:25.217
- Well. if you are referring
to the delicious cake

736
00:30:25.297 --> 00:30:26.818
that I've been eating
for breakfast.

737
00:30:26.898 --> 00:30:29.541
I don't think I could ever
have enough Swiss culture!

738
00:30:29.621 --> 00:30:31.943
- Good.
- Hey. what are
you guys doing?

739
00:30:32.023 --> 00:30:33.865
Oh. is that panettone?

740
00:30:33.945 --> 00:30:35.467
Oh! Mum used to make this.

741
00:30:35.547 --> 00:30:37.148
Don't mind if I do.

742
00:30:37.229 --> 00:30:39.231
Hmm! Hmm! It is amazing!

743
00:30:39.311 --> 00:30:41.833
- Hey! Hey. hey. hey!
We're taste testing here.

744
00:30:41.913 --> 00:30:43.755
- That's what I'm doing.
tasting and testing.

745
00:30:43.835 --> 00:30:45.917
- Huh!
- And you.
my good sir.

746
00:30:45.997 --> 00:30:47.439
that passed with
flying colours.

747
00:30:47.519 --> 00:30:49.201
Bravo!
<i>- Merci.</i>

748
00:30:49.281 --> 00:30:51.283
- We were just talking about
going to the Christmas market.

749
00:30:51.363 --> 00:30:52.764
- Ha. That would
be totally fun.

750
00:30:52.844 --> 00:30:54.566
Yeah. I would
totally come!

751
00:30:54.646 --> 00:30:56.248
- Yeah. well. we didn't
really invite you. so...

752
00:30:56.328 --> 00:30:59.050
- Oh! The more the merrier.
Everybody should come.

753
00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:01.493
- Yeah! Hey. mum!
- Huh?

754
00:31:01.573 --> 00:31:03.775
- Alex and Liam invited us
to the Christmas market.

755
00:31:03.855 --> 00:31:05.977
You should come.
- Oh. that is a great idea!

756
00:31:06.057 --> 00:31:08.500
And I'm sure Nadine and Beth
would love to join us.

757
00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.142
- You know. it wasn't really
going to be a group thing.

758
00:31:11.223 --> 00:31:13.184
- Oh. is this
<i>lebkuchen?</i> Ha!

759
00:31:13.265 --> 00:31:14.746
Oh. it's so good!

760
00:31:14.826 --> 00:31:16.348
(laughs)

761
00:31:16.428 --> 00:31:17.829
Oh. this is gonna be
so much fun!

762
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:19.351
I have not been to
the Christmas market

763
00:31:19.431 --> 00:31:21.433
since I was a little girl.

764
00:31:21.513 --> 00:31:23.675
You guys are gonna love it.

765
00:31:23.755 --> 00:31:25.677
I'm so glad we're all
doing this together.
- Ha.

766
00:31:25.757 --> 00:31:27.639
- This was such
a great idea. Alex.

767
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.841
- Yeah. very sweet of you
to organise all this.

768
00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.283
- Oh. yeah.

769
00:31:31.363 --> 00:31:33.405
Well. it's gonna be
so much fun. Thanks.

770
00:31:33.485 --> 00:31:36.288
(♪♪♪)

771
00:31:37.369 --> 00:31:42.213
(Christmas music)

772
00:31:59.831 --> 00:32:03.835
(♪♪♪)

773
00:32:09.281 --> 00:32:11.723
- Wow! This place is magical.

774
00:32:11.803 --> 00:32:13.244
It's like a storybook.

775
00:32:13.325 --> 00:32:15.767
- It's just
our way of life.

776
00:32:15.847 --> 00:32:18.169
- Well. it's
a pretty good one.

777
00:32:18.249 --> 00:32:20.051
- Can I get some
chestnuts. Dad?

778
00:32:20.131 --> 00:32:21.613
- Sure you can.

779
00:32:21.693 --> 00:32:23.815
Listen. I want you
to share with Noah. okay?

780
00:32:23.895 --> 00:32:25.337
- Okay.
- Okay.

781
00:32:25.417 --> 00:32:27.419
You go. go. go.

782
00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:30.181
- I'll try some of this.

783
00:32:32.744 --> 00:32:34.346
- Noah!
- Hey!

784
00:32:34.426 --> 00:32:37.549
- Let's go get
some chestnuts.
- Okay.

785
00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:39.631
- Let's go

786
00:32:43.635 --> 00:32:45.637
- Hum!

787
00:32:46.838 --> 00:32:48.520
- Oh! Come and have a look!

788
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.602
Ha! Oh. can we see
that one. please?

789
00:32:50.682 --> 00:32:52.724
Look. it's a <i>Schmutzli</i> candle.

790
00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:55.567
- Oh!
- Yes!

791
00:32:55.647 --> 00:32:57.168
Thank you!
- Ha!

792
00:32:57.248 --> 00:32:58.930
- Isn't that lovely?
- Wow! It's
beautiful!

793
00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.693
<i>- Danke schoen.</i>

794
00:33:03.695 --> 00:33:05.897
- Hey. Alex?

795
00:33:07.939 --> 00:33:10.181
- I'll be right there.

796
00:33:12.263 --> 00:33:15.547
- Hi. The guy at the booth gave
me an extra. you want it?

797
00:33:15.627 --> 00:33:17.469
It's called Glühwein.

798
00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:18.990
Spicy Christmas wine.

799
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.272
- Nah. I'm good. thanks.

800
00:33:21.353 --> 00:33:22.754
- Are you sure?

801
00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:24.716
It's just gonna go to waste.

802
00:33:24.796 --> 00:33:26.758
- Okay. sure. why not?

803
00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.880
Thanks.

804
00:33:30.161 --> 00:33:32.764
- Hey. what is this?!

805
00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:35.767
(♪♪♪)

806
00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:37.489
- It's candle making.
You wanna try?

807
00:33:37.569 --> 00:33:39.290
- We can make
our own candles?

808
00:33:39.371 --> 00:33:40.972
We have to!

809
00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:42.814
Do you remember how much we used
to love Christmas crafts?

810
00:33:42.894 --> 00:33:47.419
- Yeah. Yeah. I do.
- How does
it works?

811
00:33:47.499 --> 00:33:49.701
- Well. first you choose a wick
and then you dip it in the wax.

812
00:33:49.781 --> 00:33:51.383
Pretty simple.

813
00:33:51.463 --> 00:33:54.386
- But there are so many colours.
Alex. red. your favourite.

814
00:33:54.466 --> 00:33:56.147
- Yeah. you can
mix and match.

815
00:33:56.227 --> 00:33:58.109
Just make sure you dip
the candle in the cold water

816
00:33:58.189 --> 00:33:59.991
to cool enough before
you put the next layer.

817
00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:02.954
- What do you do with all
the candles when you're done?

818
00:34:03.034 --> 00:34:06.317
- Well. most people here use
them for their Advent calendars.

819
00:34:06.398 --> 00:34:07.999
You put four candles in a wreath

820
00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:09.721
and light one every Sunday
until Christmas.

821
00:34:09.801 --> 00:34:11.723
- Oh. we should buy
a wreath here!

822
00:34:11.803 --> 00:34:14.486
Do you remember we used to make
Advent calendars out of felt?

823
00:34:14.566 --> 00:34:17.609
- Yeah. till Andy started
using them as dart boards.

824
00:34:17.689 --> 00:34:19.130
- Oh. that's right!

825
00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:21.573
He really messed up
the chocolates inside.

826
00:34:21.653 --> 00:34:23.495
- You know. Andy was
so annoying.

827
00:34:23.575 --> 00:34:26.297
- Hey.
I heard that.
- Oh. good!

828
00:34:26.377 --> 00:34:28.139
Then. I don't have
to say it again.

829
00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:29.941
- Oh. come on.
you guys loved

830
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:31.623
my high jinks when we were kids.

831
00:34:31.703 --> 00:34:33.985
- Ha. Sure we did
- Not exactly.

832
00:34:34.065 --> 00:34:36.948
- Okay. fine. they like
the attention.

833
00:34:37.028 --> 00:34:39.751
- Oh!
- Hmm! Did we?

834
00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:42.674
- Oh. whatever.
you're dripping.
- Oh. ha!

835
00:34:42.754 --> 00:34:44.716
Hot. hot! Ow! Hahaha!

836
00:34:44.796 --> 00:34:47.278
Thank you.
I blame you.

837
00:34:47.358 --> 00:34:49.641
Hahaha!

838
00:34:49.721 --> 00:34:52.323
Let's stick with
the Christmas wine.

839
00:34:52.403 --> 00:34:57.449
(♪♪♪)

840
00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.413
- Did you have
a good time. Noah?

841
00:35:01.493 --> 00:35:04.736
- Oh! So pretty!

842
00:35:04.816 --> 00:35:07.058
- Kelby. Ha!

843
00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:10.422
Alright! Well. I better
take this guy home

844
00:35:10.502 --> 00:35:13.184
before I gotta
carry him home.
- Yeah.

845
00:35:13.264 --> 00:35:15.266
Thanks for taking us all
out to the market tonight.

846
00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:16.748
It was really fun.

847
00:35:16.828 --> 00:35:18.229
I think everyone
enjoyed themselves.

848
00:35:18.309 --> 00:35:20.832
It's nice to see my mum
having some fun.

849
00:35:20.912 --> 00:35:22.313
The last couple of years
have been

850
00:35:22.393 --> 00:35:24.395
really hard since
my dad died. so...

851
00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:27.238
- I can relate.

852
00:35:27.318 --> 00:35:30.041
- Hum.
- I had a lot
of fun tonight too.

853
00:35:32.243 --> 00:35:33.885
Here's your candle.

854
00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:35.607
Maybe you wanna put
on your wreath.

855
00:35:35.687 --> 00:35:39.130
- You're sure you don't
wanna come and do that?

856
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.332
- No. you should do it.

857
00:35:41.412 --> 00:35:42.894
I'm gonna take this guy home!

858
00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:44.536
- Haha! Alright.

859
00:35:44.616 --> 00:35:46.618
Good night
- Bye.

860
00:35:47.458 --> 00:35:49.581
Okay. here we gooo!

861
00:35:49.661 --> 00:35:51.422
(Kelby laughing)

862
00:35:51.503 --> 00:35:54.065
- Good night. Kelby!

863
00:35:55.667 --> 00:35:57.869
- So. let's see. we've had

864
00:35:57.949 --> 00:35:59.551
two Sundays
so far. right?
- That's right.

865
00:35:59.631 --> 00:36:01.392
And then tomorrow.
we get to light

866
00:36:01.472 --> 00:36:03.434
the third candle.

867
00:36:03.515 --> 00:36:06.317
Then. just eight days
till Christmas.
- Wow!

868
00:36:07.719 --> 00:36:09.601
- Yeah!

869
00:36:09.681 --> 00:36:11.122
- Thanks. mum!
It's good.

870
00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:12.604
- Ha!

871
00:36:12.684 --> 00:36:14.085
(phone ringing)

872
00:36:14.165 --> 00:36:15.607
- (Nadine): It's a
beautiful tradition.

873
00:36:15.687 --> 00:36:18.129
- Ha. Sorry. it's Jesse.

874
00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:20.171
Hey! How is it going?

875
00:36:20.251 --> 00:36:21.653
<i>- It's good.</i>

876
00:36:21.733 --> 00:36:23.134
Sorry I didn't call sooner.

877
00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:24.816
<i>- I get it. you're busy.</i>

878
00:36:24.896 --> 00:36:27.018
We miss you. You should see
this place. it's amazing.

879
00:36:27.098 --> 00:36:28.540
<i>- Sorry I'm gonna miss it.</i>

880
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.742
I can't believe
the trial's going

881
00:36:30.822 --> 00:36:32.544
all the way through
the holidays.

882
00:36:32.624 --> 00:36:35.386
- Can't you take some days off?
The hours you put in...

883
00:36:35.466 --> 00:36:37.188
<i>It feels like you should</i>
<i>have a lot.</i>

884
00:36:37.268 --> 00:36:38.710
- Yeah. sorry. it doesn't
work like that.

885
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.231
I gotta do what I'm told.

886
00:36:40.311 --> 00:36:42.834
- Okay. I get it.

887
00:36:42.914 --> 00:36:44.475
I love you.

888
00:36:44.556 --> 00:36:46.117
<i>- I love you too.</i>

889
00:36:46.197 --> 00:36:47.639
<i>I'll try to Facetime</i>
<i>on Christmas Day. okay?</i>

890
00:36:47.719 --> 00:36:49.360
- Sounds good. Bye!

891
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.922
<i>- Okay. bye.</i>

892
00:36:51.002 --> 00:36:54.165
- Doesn't it look pretty?
That's so pretty!

893
00:36:54.245 --> 00:36:57.248
(snowblower)

894
00:37:01.773 --> 00:37:05.016
(♪♪♪)

895
00:37:05.096 --> 00:37:07.338
- Just wait till you see
what he has for tomorrow.

896
00:37:07.418 --> 00:37:10.341
- Hey!
Morning. Liam.
- Morning.

897
00:37:11.583 --> 00:37:13.264
- Hey. Alex!

898
00:37:13.344 --> 00:37:15.226
- Morning.
- Hi. honey.

899
00:37:15.306 --> 00:37:17.789
Hey. we were thinking of doing
a girl ski day today.

900
00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:19.751
Just the four of us.
like old times.

901
00:37:19.831 --> 00:37:22.794
What do you say?
- You know. honestly.
I'm a little tired

902
00:37:22.874 --> 00:37:24.676
from last night.
- Come on.
it'll be fun.

903
00:37:24.756 --> 00:37:27.278
Do you remember when we used
to ditch them on the mountain

904
00:37:27.358 --> 00:37:29.120
because they were so slow

905
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.642
and they called ski patrol on us

906
00:37:30.722 --> 00:37:32.283
because they thought
we were missing?

907
00:37:32.363 --> 00:37:34.165
- Ha. no. no. no!

908
00:37:34.245 --> 00:37:36.007
We called ski patrol on you
to teach you a lesson

909
00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:37.568
about ditching your mums.

910
00:37:37.649 --> 00:37:39.130
not because we thought
that you were missing.

911
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:40.652
- Exactly.
- Hahaha!

912
00:37:40.732 --> 00:37:42.814
- There's a rental place
right down the street.

913
00:37:42.894 --> 00:37:45.176
We could even do
a half-day.

914
00:37:45.256 --> 00:37:47.178
so you can have a nice
lazy morning if you want.

915
00:37:47.258 --> 00:37:48.980
What do you say?

916
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.462
I mean. it'll be so much fun.
there's no reason to say no!

917
00:37:51.542 --> 00:37:52.944
- That is great!

918
00:37:53.024 --> 00:37:55.546
- I just don't wanna go. Okay?

919
00:37:55.627 --> 00:38:00.111
(♪♪♪)

920
00:38:02.593 --> 00:38:06.117
Uh. I'm sorry.
I'm just a little stressed

921
00:38:06.197 --> 00:38:07.719
with everything there is
to do for the opening.

922
00:38:07.799 --> 00:38:09.320
so maybe another day.

923
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.162
- Yeah. sure. sounds good.

924
00:38:11.242 --> 00:38:13.364
Anything we can do to help?

925
00:38:13.444 --> 00:38:15.526
- No. I got it.
thanks.

926
00:38:15.606 --> 00:38:18.049
Uh. I hope to hear
all about it later. though.

927
00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:20.652
(♪♪♪)

928
00:38:23.534 --> 00:38:26.818
(sigh)

929
00:38:26.898 --> 00:38:30.902
(♪♪♪)

930
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:41.793
Hey.

931
00:38:43.514 --> 00:38:45.036
- Everything okay?

932
00:38:45.116 --> 00:38:48.439
- Ha. Not really

933
00:38:48.519 --> 00:38:50.682
(She sighs.)

934
00:38:50.762 --> 00:38:52.724
Beth and I used to be
best friends.

935
00:38:52.804 --> 00:38:55.646
I mean. since we were
born basically.

936
00:38:55.727 --> 00:38:58.970
Now. the guy she lives
with. Jesse.

937
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:01.132
it's my ex-boyfriend.

938
00:39:01.212 --> 00:39:03.574
- And?

939
00:39:03.654 --> 00:39:06.938
- And Jesse was
my first love.

940
00:39:07.018 --> 00:39:09.380
He broke my heart.

941
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.063
And then. like six months later.
they were dating. so...

942
00:39:13.705 --> 00:39:16.147
- Oof.

943
00:39:16.227 --> 00:39:18.229
- Yeah.

944
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.953
- Why. are you still in love
with this Jesse guy?

945
00:39:22.033 --> 00:39:25.156
- No! No. definitely not.

946
00:39:25.236 --> 00:39:27.318
I mean. that was ages ago.

947
00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:30.521
- So. what's the problem?

948
00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:34.766
- The problem is that
you don't date and steal

949
00:39:34.846 --> 00:39:36.728
your best friend's ex-boyfriend.

950
00:39:36.808 --> 00:39:40.331
- And you don't think
that you can forgive her?

951
00:39:42.693 --> 00:39:44.736
- I want to. you know.

952
00:39:44.816 --> 00:39:47.018
I really do.

953
00:39:47.098 --> 00:39:48.539
We had so much fun
last night.

954
00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:51.182
You know. I miss her.

955
00:39:51.262 --> 00:39:53.504
- So. you're scared
to get close again?

956
00:39:53.584 --> 00:39:55.466
(♪♪♪)

957
00:39:55.546 --> 00:39:57.148
- Yeah.

958
00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:58.629
Is that stupid?

959
00:39:58.709 --> 00:40:01.592
- Of course not.
No. no. it's natural.

960
00:40:01.672 --> 00:40:05.356
It's just... you know.
it's too bad.

961
00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:08.239
A whole friendship.
all that history

962
00:40:08.319 --> 00:40:10.361
down the drain
because of a guy?

963
00:40:12.083 --> 00:40:14.325
- Yeah.

964
00:40:14.405 --> 00:40:17.168
- Well. you know what?
Good riddance.

965
00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.130
You know. you are travelling
all over the world now.

966
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:21.132
you're living life
to the fullest.

967
00:40:21.212 --> 00:40:23.574
You are happier
than everyone. right?

968
00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:27.819
- Yeah. Totally.

969
00:40:31.622 --> 00:40:33.985
- Hey. what are you
doing tonight?

970
00:40:34.065 --> 00:40:38.469
- Well. after my little outburst
inside. probably nothing.

971
00:40:38.549 --> 00:40:41.112
- Why don't you come to
the coffee shop around six PM?

972
00:40:41.192 --> 00:40:43.154
There is something
that I wanna show you.
- Ha.

973
00:40:43.234 --> 00:40:45.436
Some more Swiss
Christmas culture?

974
00:40:45.516 --> 00:40:47.158
- Oh. wouldn't you
like to know!

975
00:40:47.238 --> 00:40:49.160
- Hahaha!

976
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.642
(♪♪♪)

977
00:40:51.722 --> 00:40:54.525
- That's nice.

978
00:40:54.605 --> 00:40:56.447
Good job.
- Thanks.

979
00:40:56.527 --> 00:40:58.930
- Oh!

980
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.813
You guys are making
gingerbread men?
- Yeah.

981
00:41:01.893 --> 00:41:04.655
- Nice.
- Haha.

982
00:41:04.735 --> 00:41:06.337
- In France. we call
them <i>roule galette.</i>

983
00:41:06.417 --> 00:41:08.219
- What do you
think of mine?

984
00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:10.862
I've got raisins for the eyes.
a cinnamon drop for the mouth

985
00:41:10.942 --> 00:41:13.064
and chocolate chips
for the buttons.

986
00:41:13.144 --> 00:41:15.506
just like the story.

987
00:41:15.586 --> 00:41:17.428
- What story. grandma?

988
00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:20.431
- Ha. you don't know
the story of <i>Roule Galette?</i>

989
00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:24.235
- Oh. sweetheart. well.
it's about a gingerbread man

990
00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:27.478
who runs away from everybody
he's ever encountered

991
00:41:27.558 --> 00:41:29.240
because he's afraid
of getting hurt.

992
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.762
- Ha. He's afraid
of getting eaten!

993
00:41:31.843 --> 00:41:34.085
But one day. he places
his trust in a fox.

994
00:41:34.165 --> 00:41:37.208
but the fox tricks him

995
00:41:37.288 --> 00:41:39.570
and gobbles
him up!
- No!

996
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.212
- Yes!

997
00:41:41.292 --> 00:41:42.693
- Well. it sounds like
that gingerbread man

998
00:41:42.773 --> 00:41:44.495
just shouldn't
have trusted anyone.

999
00:41:44.575 --> 00:41:47.578
- Oh. now that is definitely
the wrong lesson here. honey.

1000
00:41:47.658 --> 00:41:49.700
- Hmm. Well. I'm gonna take off.

1001
00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.822
- Where're you off to?

1002
00:41:51.903 --> 00:41:53.784
- I'm going out
with Liam.
- Oh. nice.

1003
00:41:53.865 --> 00:41:55.426
Is there something going on
between you two?

1004
00:41:55.506 --> 00:41:56.908
Is this a date?

1005
00:41:56.988 --> 00:41:59.030
- What? No!
No. it's not a date!

1006
00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.591
Why would you even ask that?

1007
00:42:00.671 --> 00:42:02.113
- Ha. Mother knows.

1008
00:42:02.193 --> 00:42:04.275
- Well. you are nosy.

1009
00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:06.557
But no. it's not a date. Geez!

1010
00:42:06.637 --> 00:42:08.479
- Okay. whatever you say.

1011
00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:10.561
- Alright. I'll see
you guys later.

1012
00:42:12.003 --> 00:42:13.925
- It's definitely a date.

1013
00:42:14.005 --> 00:42:15.846
- Ha! It's definitely a date.

1014
00:42:15.927 --> 00:42:18.169
- Whatever.

1015
00:42:23.414 --> 00:42:25.256
- Oh. hey!

1016
00:42:25.336 --> 00:42:26.938
- Hey. Alex.

1017
00:42:27.018 --> 00:42:28.459
You look really pretty.

1018
00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:30.821
- Oh. Thanks.

1019
00:42:30.902 --> 00:42:33.144
- I brought you a most.

1020
00:42:33.224 --> 00:42:35.106
- Oh! Thank you!

1021
00:42:35.186 --> 00:42:37.108
What is a most?

1022
00:42:37.188 --> 00:42:39.390
- It's kind of like a hot cider.

1023
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.193
- Oh! Okay.

1024
00:42:42.273 --> 00:42:44.795
Hum! Oh. yummy!

1025
00:42:44.875 --> 00:42:46.277
Ha.

1026
00:42:46.357 --> 00:42:49.600
So. uh. what are
we waiting for?

1027
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.123
- Oh. well we are patiently
awaiting the unveiling

1028
00:42:52.203 --> 00:42:54.325
of the latest <i>Adventsfenster.</i>

1029
00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:56.567
<i>- Adventsfenster?</i>
- Uhum.

1030
00:42:56.647 --> 00:42:58.129
It's a town tradition.

1031
00:42:58.209 --> 00:42:59.890
People here. they decorate
their windows at Christmas.

1032
00:42:59.971 --> 00:43:02.934
then they close the shutters
and you can't see them.

1033
00:43:03.014 --> 00:43:06.217
And then every night in December
leading up until Christmas.

1034
00:43:06.297 --> 00:43:08.099
we all gather around
a different window.

1035
00:43:08.179 --> 00:43:09.580
the shutters open.

1036
00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.382
the decorations are revealed.

1037
00:43:11.462 --> 00:43:13.664
- Oh. I love that.

1038
00:43:13.744 --> 00:43:16.387
So it's. it's like
a literal Advent calendar.

1039
00:43:16.467 --> 00:43:18.069
but with real windows.

1040
00:43:18.149 --> 00:43:19.750
- Exactly.

1041
00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:23.034
You know. displays are mostly
drawings and paper cut out.

1042
00:43:23.114 --> 00:43:24.675
but sometimes
people go all out.

1043
00:43:24.755 --> 00:43:26.477
- Ha. It's really fun.

1044
00:43:26.557 --> 00:43:29.560
You know. I really love
some of these Swiss traditions.

1045
00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.362
I gotta bring some of them
back to the States.

1046
00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:34.205
- It's just a great way
to bring the community together.

1047
00:43:34.285 --> 00:43:36.807
That way. you know. people don't
have to celebrate alone at home.

1048
00:43:36.887 --> 00:43:38.289
We can all celebrate together.

1049
00:43:38.369 --> 00:43:41.612
- Oh! I love that.

1050
00:43:41.692 --> 00:43:43.894
- Oh! It looks like
it's about to start. so...

1051
00:43:43.975 --> 00:43:46.577
- Oh. exciting!

1052
00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:50.061
(♪♪♪)

1053
00:43:50.141 --> 00:43:51.862
(exclamations)

1054
00:43:51.942 --> 00:43:54.305
Oh. it's beautiful!

1055
00:43:54.385 --> 00:43:56.787
Now. is the sixteen for
the sixteenth of December?

1056
00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:59.470
- You got it.

1057
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.993
- Okay. Oh.
you know what?

1058
00:44:02.073 --> 00:44:03.514
It would be so much fun
for the inn

1059
00:44:03.594 --> 00:44:05.116
to do one of these
next year.

1060
00:44:05.196 --> 00:44:07.078
- Actually. we're doing
one this year

1061
00:44:07.158 --> 00:44:08.839
on the twenty-fourth.
you know.

1062
00:44:08.919 --> 00:44:11.602
We're the last reveal
of the season.

1063
00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:14.405
- Oh! Maybe I can help
with the window.

1064
00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:16.287
- Yeah!

1065
00:44:16.367 --> 00:44:18.009
That would be great
because that is still

1066
00:44:18.089 --> 00:44:19.930
one of the many unfinished
items on my to-do list.

1067
00:44:20.011 --> 00:44:21.532
- Oh!

1068
00:44:21.612 --> 00:44:23.654
Well. maybe Kelby
can help too.

1069
00:44:23.734 --> 00:44:25.896
- He would love that.

1070
00:44:25.976 --> 00:44:28.739
- Do you think you can maybe
take me around

1071
00:44:28.819 --> 00:44:30.741
to see some of the other
<i>Adventfensters</i> in town.

1072
00:44:30.821 --> 00:44:32.543
so I can get
some inspiration?

1073
00:44:32.623 --> 00:44:34.665
- Of course.
Follow me.

1074
00:44:37.148 --> 00:44:42.033
(♪♪♪)

1075
00:44:47.758 --> 00:44:50.881
- This one here is
one of my personal favourites.

1076
00:44:50.961 --> 00:44:53.044
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

1077
00:44:55.126 --> 00:44:57.568
- Oh!

1078
00:44:57.648 --> 00:44:59.050
That's adorable.

1079
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.531
- Actually. this is my house.

1080
00:45:00.611 --> 00:45:02.173
- Really?
- Yeah.

1081
00:45:02.253 --> 00:45:04.135
It's been in my family
for generations.

1082
00:45:04.215 --> 00:45:06.257
It was one of the first houses
built in this town.

1083
00:45:06.337 --> 00:45:07.778
- Ha.

1084
00:45:07.858 --> 00:45:11.542
I'd love to see the inside.
if that's okay.

1085
00:45:11.622 --> 00:45:13.624
- Of course.

1086
00:45:14.785 --> 00:45:19.670
(♪♪♪)

1087
00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:25.796
- Wow! Your house is
so adorable. Liam!

1088
00:45:25.876 --> 00:45:28.519
I love it.
- Thank you.

1089
00:45:28.599 --> 00:45:33.244
- I do have to ask. though.
where is your Christmas tree?

1090
00:45:33.324 --> 00:45:34.965
- Well. here in Switzerland.

1091
00:45:35.045 --> 00:45:37.568
we don't decorate our trees
until Christmas Eve.

1092
00:45:37.648 --> 00:45:39.370
Well. here it's <i>Heiliger Abend.</i>

1093
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:41.051
- Oh! So that explains why

1094
00:45:41.132 --> 00:45:43.654
there's not one at the inn.
then. either.

1095
00:45:43.734 --> 00:45:45.336
- You know. it's actually really
fun for the kids.

1096
00:45:45.416 --> 00:45:46.977
We keep the trees hidden
<i>Heiliger Abend.</i>

1097
00:45:47.057 --> 00:45:48.459
then we bring it out.

1098
00:45:48.539 --> 00:45:49.980
We surprise them.
- Ha!

1099
00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.502
- Actually. I was planning
a big <i>Heiliger Abend</i>

1100
00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:54.465
at the inn on the twenty-fourth.

1101
00:45:54.545 --> 00:45:56.227
You're welcome to join.
if you want.

1102
00:45:56.307 --> 00:45:58.549
- Of course!
Yeah. I'd love to.

1103
00:46:01.192 --> 00:46:03.474
So. are you happy

1104
00:46:03.554 --> 00:46:05.556
you moved back here
to Wengen?

1105
00:46:07.077 --> 00:46:08.519
- Yeah.

1106
00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:10.040
You know. at first.
I was a little scared

1107
00:46:10.121 --> 00:46:11.922
that I might get stiffled.

1108
00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:13.764
I used to be a lot
like you. actually.

1109
00:46:13.844 --> 00:46:15.446
I travelled
all over the world.

1110
00:46:15.526 --> 00:46:18.169
I was running the world's
biggest hotels.

1111
00:46:18.249 --> 00:46:20.691
meeting VIPs.

1112
00:46:20.771 --> 00:46:22.933
I think I could have gone
along like that forever.

1113
00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:26.457
- Yeah. I'd imagine it would be
hard to maintain that lifestyle

1114
00:46:26.537 --> 00:46:28.139
and be a single parent.

1115
00:46:28.219 --> 00:46:32.983
- Yeah. But honestly.
once I learned to slow down.

1116
00:46:33.063 --> 00:46:35.025
I realized that I've been
keeping myself so busy.

1117
00:46:35.105 --> 00:46:36.627
I didn't even know
who I was anymore.

1118
00:46:36.707 --> 00:46:38.589
Living here.

1119
00:46:38.669 --> 00:46:41.432
being able to connect
with my roots.

1120
00:46:41.512 --> 00:46:43.194
learning about my family.
their past...

1121
00:46:43.274 --> 00:46:45.196
I mean. Kelby... I mean. he gets
to spend so much more time

1122
00:46:45.276 --> 00:46:47.077
with his grandparents.
his <i>grosi</i> and <i>gropi.</i>

1123
00:46:47.158 --> 00:46:48.599
He just adores them so.

1124
00:46:48.679 --> 00:46:50.801
- Is that where he is tonight?

1125
00:46:50.881 --> 00:46:52.683
- Uhum.

1126
00:46:52.763 --> 00:46:56.207
- And you don't feel like
you're missing out on the world

1127
00:46:56.287 --> 00:46:58.048
living in a small village?

1128
00:46:58.128 --> 00:47:00.010
- Well. I mean. the world
is still out there.

1129
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.293
You know. I can still visit it
whenever I want.

1130
00:47:02.373 --> 00:47:04.615
- Yeah.

1131
00:47:04.695 --> 00:47:06.857
- I guess I can ask you
the same thing.

1132
00:47:06.937 --> 00:47:09.300
- What do you mean?

1133
00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.101
- Well. you spend all your time

1134
00:47:11.182 --> 00:47:14.185
running away to different
countries building these hotels

1135
00:47:14.265 --> 00:47:17.188
for people who are just
also running away.

1136
00:47:17.268 --> 00:47:19.910
You ever feel like
you're missing out?

1137
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:23.194
A sense of home or community.
or roots?

1138
00:47:23.274 --> 00:47:26.116
- Hum. Well. sometimes.

1139
00:47:26.197 --> 00:47:29.640
but. I don't know. my mum lives
here in Switzerland now

1140
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.722
and. you know. Andy
and his family are in Africa.

1141
00:47:31.802 --> 00:47:34.084
so...

1142
00:47:34.164 --> 00:47:37.648
I guess I don't really
have roots anymore.

1143
00:47:37.728 --> 00:47:39.530
- Have you ever considered
that it's maybe

1144
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:42.052
because you never stay put
long enough to plant new ones?

1145
00:47:42.132 --> 00:47:44.255
- Touché!

1146
00:47:44.335 --> 00:47:46.657
Hahaha!

1147
00:47:48.339 --> 00:47:50.541
But don't you get tired
of seeing the same people

1148
00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:52.383
like day after day?

1149
00:47:52.463 --> 00:47:54.705
- Yeah. But you know.
sometimes. I get to meet

1150
00:47:54.785 --> 00:47:56.347
new and intriguing people.

1151
00:47:56.427 --> 00:47:59.590
- Hum! New intriguing people?

1152
00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.512
- Yeah. New
and intriguing

1153
00:48:01.592 --> 00:48:03.714
and kind-hearted.

1154
00:48:03.794 --> 00:48:06.437
People who love to travel
and learn about new cultures.

1155
00:48:10.361 --> 00:48:12.002
- Hum.

1156
00:48:12.082 --> 00:48:14.925
- Ha. Most?

1157
00:48:15.005 --> 00:48:17.328
- Yes. I'd love some.

1158
00:48:17.408 --> 00:48:19.410
Thanks.

1159
00:48:24.375 --> 00:48:28.899
(♪♪♪)

1160
00:48:31.542 --> 00:48:33.384
Thanks for walking me back.

1161
00:48:33.464 --> 00:48:35.145
- Of course.
Anytime.

1162
00:48:35.225 --> 00:48:37.828
- And thanks for taking me
to the <i>Adventfester.</i>

1163
00:48:37.908 --> 00:48:39.710
It was really beautiful.

1164
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:41.672
I'm lucky I got
to experience it.

1165
00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.994
- Well. you know.
I care about you. so...

1166
00:48:45.276 --> 00:48:47.077
- You care about me?

1167
00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:49.560
- I do.

1168
00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.842
(♪♪♪)

1169
00:48:51.922 --> 00:48:55.085
Well. I guess I should
be heading back.

1170
00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:57.608
- Yeah.
- Kelby will be
home soon. so...

1171
00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.252
I'll see you in the morning?

1172
00:49:02.333 --> 00:49:04.375
- Yeah. I'll... I'll be here.

1173
00:49:08.459 --> 00:49:10.861
Good night!

1174
00:49:24.274 --> 00:49:26.156
- Hey. Alex.

1175
00:49:26.236 --> 00:49:28.238
- Hey.

1176
00:49:29.079 --> 00:49:30.441
What are you doing?

1177
00:49:30.521 --> 00:49:32.763
- I'm just trying to light
all three candles

1178
00:49:32.843 --> 00:49:34.284
since it's Sunday.

1179
00:49:34.365 --> 00:49:35.846
but the matches got wet
or something.

1180
00:49:35.926 --> 00:49:37.648
It's not working.

1181
00:49:37.728 --> 00:49:39.490
- I think I found a lighter
in this drawer the other day.

1182
00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.171
Do you want to...

1183
00:49:41.251 --> 00:49:43.334
- Yeah. Great.
- Let's see.

1184
00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:45.456
Ha.

1185
00:49:50.381 --> 00:49:51.982
There you go.
- Thanks.

1186
00:49:52.062 --> 00:49:54.064
- Yeah.

1187
00:49:56.106 --> 00:50:00.871
(♪♪♪)

1188
00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:04.355
Nice.
- Yeah.

1189
00:50:04.435 --> 00:50:06.437
Look. I don't wanna
spoil the mument.

1190
00:50:06.517 --> 00:50:09.159
but can I just say one thing?

1191
00:50:09.239 --> 00:50:11.922
Something I've wanted to say
for a really long time.

1192
00:50:12.002 --> 00:50:13.804
- Uh. yeah.
Yeah. what?

1193
00:50:13.884 --> 00:50:17.007
- Jesse and I only started
dating after you two broke up.

1194
00:50:17.087 --> 00:50:20.330
and didn't mean for it
to happen. I swear.

1195
00:50:20.411 --> 00:50:22.813
I... I tried
to stop myself

1196
00:50:22.893 --> 00:50:25.656
from having feelings
for him. I really did.

1197
00:50:25.736 --> 00:50:28.338
but it just got
to the point where...

1198
00:50:28.419 --> 00:50:30.421
I realised I couldn't
live without him.

1199
00:50:32.703 --> 00:50:35.105
- Ha! Uh. Alex.

1200
00:50:35.185 --> 00:50:36.987
Noah was wondering
if you'd tuck him in.

1201
00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:38.509
- Yeah.

1202
00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:40.831
I'll be right there.

1203
00:50:43.594 --> 00:50:48.599
(♪♪♪)

1204
00:50:50.721 --> 00:50:53.884
(♪♪♪)

1205
00:50:56.687 --> 00:50:58.449
- Hey! Good morning!

1206
00:50:58.529 --> 00:51:00.130
- Good morning.
sweetheart.

1207
00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:01.852
You're in a
good mood.

1208
00:51:01.932 --> 00:51:04.415
- Well. it's a beautiful day
outside. what can I say?

1209
00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:06.457
- Hum. What are you up to?

1210
00:51:06.537 --> 00:51:08.258
- Actually. I'm gonna go
sledding with Liam and Kelby.

1211
00:51:08.338 --> 00:51:09.740
- Oh. Liam!

1212
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.463
- Stop it!
You wanna come?

1213
00:51:12.543 --> 00:51:15.185
- No. no. I'm just getting
to the good part of the book.
- Alright.

1214
00:51:15.265 --> 00:51:17.588
Mum? Nadine?

1215
00:51:17.668 --> 00:51:20.070
- Oh. I really wanna get
going on this puzzle.

1216
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.473
- Sorry. Alex. but I think
my sledding days are behind me.

1217
00:51:22.553 --> 00:51:24.154
(Nadine laughs.)

1218
00:51:24.234 --> 00:51:26.316
- Uh. Beth?
- Huhum. Sorry.

1219
00:51:26.396 --> 00:51:27.798
- Alrighty. then!

1220
00:51:27.878 --> 00:51:29.880
Well. your guys' lost.

1221
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.361
- Oh. but I can get
Louis to pack you

1222
00:51:31.442 --> 00:51:32.883
a couple of thermoses
of <i>Gerstensuppe.</i>

1223
00:51:32.963 --> 00:51:34.645
- Oh! That is an excellent idea.
Thanks. mum.

1224
00:51:34.725 --> 00:51:36.927
Alright!

1225
00:51:37.007 --> 00:51:39.409
Well. have fun with the puzzle
and I'll see you guys later.

1226
00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:40.891

- Bye!

1227
00:51:40.971 --> 00:51:43.974

1228
00:51:45.055 --> 00:51:47.698
- Hey. Alex!
- Hey!

1229
00:51:47.778 --> 00:51:49.780
Uh. I'm really sorry we got
interrupted last night.

1230
00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.782
- I just need to say to you

1231
00:51:51.862 --> 00:51:54.785
that my absolute
worst regret in life is

1232
00:51:54.865 --> 00:51:58.148
that my relationship with Jesse
ruined our friendship.

1233
00:51:58.228 --> 00:52:00.631
You were like
a sister to me

1234
00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:03.153
and I miss us.

1235
00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:06.637
- Yeah.

1236
00:52:06.717 --> 00:52:08.959
Beth. I thought long and hard

1237
00:52:09.039 --> 00:52:12.082
about this and. uh...

1238
00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:14.164
I just wanna put
this behind us.

1239
00:52:15.526 --> 00:52:17.367
- I'm so relieved
to hear you saying that!

1240
00:52:17.447 --> 00:52:20.170
- I miss my best friend!

1241
00:52:21.772 --> 00:52:24.254
Sorry!
- No! No!

1242
00:52:24.334 --> 00:52:26.216
No apology needed!

1243
00:52:26.296 --> 00:52:27.698
Ha!

1244
00:52:27.778 --> 00:52:30.340
I'm so happy
to have you back!

1245
00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:32.302
- Yeah.

1246
00:52:32.382 --> 00:52:34.585
You're sure you don't
wanna come sledding?
- No.

1247
00:52:34.665 --> 00:52:36.146
I think it's best
that stay back.

1248
00:52:36.226 --> 00:52:37.628
so you can have fun

1249
00:52:37.708 --> 00:52:39.710

1250
00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:41.792

you later.

1252
00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:50.000
- Let's go! Let's go!

1253
00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.602
- Okay. just one second.

1254
00:52:51.682 --> 00:52:53.243
Let me just get
everything ready.

1255
00:52:53.323 --> 00:52:54.725
Okay. you feel ready?

1256
00:52:54.805 --> 00:52:56.406
- Maybe Alex should come.

1257
00:52:56.486 --> 00:52:59.289
- Oh! Uh. yeah. okay!

1258
00:52:59.369 --> 00:53:00.771
Sure!

1259
00:53:00.851 --> 00:53:02.653
Thanks. Kelby.

1260
00:53:02.733 --> 00:53:04.535
Ha. I haven't done
this in decades.

1261
00:53:04.615 --> 00:53:06.216
Let's see here.

1262
00:53:06.296 --> 00:53:09.019
Here we go.
- OK!

1263
00:53:09.099 --> 00:53:11.982
- Don't worry. Alex.
I've got you.

1264
00:53:12.062 --> 00:53:13.544
- Oh. good! Good!

1265
00:53:13.624 --> 00:53:15.025
I feel much safer
now. Kelby.

1266
00:53:15.105 --> 00:53:16.547
Ready?
- Yeah.

1267
00:53:16.627 --> 00:53:18.949

Hahaha! Woo-hoo!

- I'll race
you up!

1275
00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:35.525
- Oh. man!
I'm old and slow!

1276
00:53:37.808 --> 00:53:40.330
- I need you to make
a triangle like that.
- Like this?

1277
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.532
- Like that? Okay.

1278

Plus I really wanna be here

I'm just surprised.

1299

I thought Argentina was
on top of your bucket list.

it'll be there next year.

You're off again?

- Yeah. I'm going
to Liam and Kelby's.

1330

We're gonna work on
the <i>Adventfenster</i> for the inn.

a very nice person.

Bye. mum.

Wow!

1335
00:56:58.929 --> 00:57:01.731
Kelby. this is
looking great!

1336
00:57:01.812 --> 00:57:03.854
But why is the
tree undecorated?

1337
00:57:03.934 --> 00:57:07.017
- The decorations
are here.
- Ha!

1338
00:57:07.097 --> 00:57:09.179
Okay.

some more hot cider?

1339
00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:10.781
-Yeah. I'd love some.

1340
00:57:10.861 --> 00:57:13.944

1341
00:57:14.024 --> 00:57:15.465
Ha!

Hum!

1343
00:57:17.988 --> 00:57:21.751
- My mum used to love decorating
the Christmas tree.

1344
00:57:21.832 --> 00:57:23.834
Oh yeah?

1345
00:57:24.835 --> 00:57:28.158
Did you guys have any other
fun holiday traditions?

1346
00:57:28.238 --> 00:57:30.240
- Mum and I used to sing
"Silent Night"

1347
00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.322
every Christmas Eve.

1348
00:57:33.363 --> 00:57:35.365
- Oh! Do you get to sing

1349
00:57:35.445 --> 00:57:36.807
with your dad now?

1350
00:57:36.887 --> 00:57:39.409
- No. he's not really
into singing.

1351
00:57:47.737 --> 00:57:50.460
- Oh! It's your mum.

1352
00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:52.863
Ha!

1353
00:57:52.943 --> 00:57:55.265
Wow!

1354
00:57:55.345 --> 00:57:58.508
Your mum seems like she was
a really special lady.

1355
00:57:58.588 --> 00:58:00.270
Do you have any more
photos of her?

1356
00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:02.632
- No. I don't know
where they are.

1357
00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:04.114
- Hum!

1358
00:58:04.194 --> 00:58:06.196
What do you do when
you wanna remember her?

1359
00:58:12.282 --> 00:58:15.325
- This is my old house.

1360
00:58:15.405 --> 00:58:17.687
This is my room.

1361
00:58:19.649 --> 00:58:21.251
And the piano room.

1362
00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:23.253
This is my room.

1363
00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.375
where she used to read
stories to me.

1364
00:58:25.455 --> 00:58:28.138
- Uhuh.
- That's the kitchen.
where mum and I used

1365
00:58:28.218 --> 00:58:30.460
to eat vanilla ice cream.

1366
00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.462
- Hum!

1367
00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:35.105
- That's the music room.
where she used

1368
00:58:35.185 --> 00:58:37.187
to play piano and sing.

1369
00:58:37.707 --> 00:58:40.911
- Well. these are really
great drawings. Kelby.
- Thanks.

1370
00:58:40.991 --> 00:58:43.073
- It seems like you have
a lot of nice memories

1371
00:58:43.153 --> 00:58:44.794
of your mum
and your old house.

1372
00:58:44.875 --> 00:58:46.316
Do you have anything here

1373
00:58:46.396 --> 00:58:47.837
that makes you feel
closer to her?

1374
00:58:47.918 --> 00:58:49.559
- Not really.

1375
00:58:49.639 --> 00:58:51.641
I think I'm starting
to forget her.

1376
00:58:54.084 --> 00:58:56.206
- Here you go.

1377
00:58:56.286 --> 00:58:57.727
Fresh hot cider.

1378
00:58:57.807 --> 00:58:59.209
- Thank you.
- Aw!

1379
00:58:59.289 --> 00:59:00.931
- Uhum! And somebody
looks like

1380
00:59:01.011 --> 00:59:02.452
they're ready for bed.

1381
00:59:02.532 --> 00:59:04.214
- No! I can stay up.
dad. I promise.

1382
00:59:04.294 --> 00:59:05.695
- Well. how about
if we call your <i>grosi</i>

1383
00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:08.018
to come over
and read you some stories

1384
00:59:08.098 --> 00:59:09.539
while I walk Alex home?

1385
00:59:09.619 --> 00:59:11.221
- Yeah. <i>grosi!</i>

1386
00:59:11.301 --> 00:59:14.184

1387
00:59:14.264 --> 00:59:16.266
Story time!
Hahaha!

1388
00:59:18.949 --> 00:59:23.313
(♪♪♪)

1389
00:59:25.875 --> 00:59:29.239
- I was so moved by Kelby's
drawings of your old house.

1390
00:59:29.319 --> 00:59:31.241
- It's really
sweet.
- Haha.

1391
00:59:31.321 --> 00:59:33.243
- I'm surprised about how much
he actually remembers.

1392
00:59:33.323 --> 00:59:35.045
Ha!

1393
00:59:35.125 --> 00:59:37.968
- He seems a little worried
about forgetting his mum. now.

1394
00:59:38.048 --> 00:59:41.091
He said there's not a lot
of old photographs around.

1395
00:59:41.171 --> 00:59:42.852
- Well. I mean. we still
have them. I just...

1396
00:59:42.933 --> 00:59:44.814
I don't put them out anymore.

1397
00:59:44.894 --> 00:59:47.217
Ever since she died.
he's just been so devastated

1398
00:59:47.297 --> 00:59:49.059
by anything that he sees
that reminds him of her.

1399
00:59:49.139 --> 00:59:51.261
He just turns into
a puddle of tears.

1400
00:59:51.341 --> 00:59:53.583
- Well. it's been
a few years. right?

1401
00:59:53.663 --> 00:59:56.586
I mean. maybe enough
feelings happened

1402
00:59:56.666 --> 00:59:58.708
that you could start
reintroducing some memories?

1403
00:59:58.788 --> 01:00:00.710
(sigh)

1404
01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:02.192
- Maybe.

1405
01:00:02.272 --> 01:00:03.673
- He and his mum
used to sing

1406
01:00:03.753 --> 01:00:06.516
on Christmas.
right?

1407
01:00:06.596 --> 01:00:09.719
- Yeah. It was
their tradition.

1408
01:00:09.799 --> 01:00:11.721
- And he doesn't
wanna sing anymore?

1409
01:00:11.801 --> 01:00:13.243
- Well. we couldn't
bring the piano with us

1410
01:00:13.323 --> 01:00:14.764
when we moved back
from Bern

1411
01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.526
and I can't
carry it to him.

1412
01:00:16.606 --> 01:00:18.448
Plus the thought of him
singing alone on Christmas Eve

1413
01:00:18.528 --> 01:00:19.889
without his mum.

1414
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:22.372
I think it would be
too hard on him.

1415
01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:25.375
- Ha. Maybe it's worth
a shot. you know.

1416
01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.177
It could be a nice way
for him to remember his mum.

1417
01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:28.858
(He sighs.)

1418
01:00:28.938 --> 01:00:30.500
- I just don't
wanna force it.

1419
01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.462
You know?

1420
01:00:32.542 --> 01:00:33.984
I really tried hard
to make his life

1421
01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:36.066
as pain-free as possible.

1422
01:00:37.107 --> 01:00:39.109
- You're a really good dad.

1423
01:00:39.629 --> 01:00:41.271
- Thank you.

1424
01:00:41.351 --> 01:00:42.952
And thank you for being
so great with him.

1425
01:00:43.033 --> 01:00:45.355
You know.
it really means a lot.

1426
01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:47.197
- Of course.

1427
01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:49.279
I care about you guys.

1428
01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:51.681
- You care about us?

1429
01:00:53.243 --> 01:00:55.205
- I do.

1430
01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:59.809
(♪♪♪)

1431
01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:04.694
- Is everything okay?

1432
01:01:04.774 --> 01:01:07.137
- Yeah. Yeah.

1433
01:01:07.217 --> 01:01:09.099
Yeah. I'm sorry.
everything is fine.

1434
01:01:09.179 --> 01:01:10.980
Hmm!

1435
01:01:11.061 --> 01:01:13.223
I'll see you tomorrow?

1436
01:01:14.424 --> 01:01:16.386
- Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

1437
01:01:16.466 --> 01:01:18.788
- Okay. Good night.

1438
01:01:18.868 --> 01:01:20.590
- Good night.

1439
01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:22.672
(dog barking)

1440
01:01:24.794 --> 01:01:26.276
- Jesse?

1441
01:01:26.356 --> 01:01:28.718
- Alex!

1442
01:01:28.798 --> 01:01:30.760
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to spy on your date.

1443
01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.962
- Oh. no! Uh!
It's not a date.

1444
01:01:33.043 --> 01:01:35.325
He works for my mum.

1445
01:01:35.405 --> 01:01:37.006
What are you doing here?

1446
01:01:37.087 --> 01:01:38.768
I thought you had a case
that ran through the holidays?

1447
01:01:38.848 --> 01:01:40.770
- I did too. but the judge
had a personal emergency.

1448
01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:42.772
so they postponed it
to mid-January.

1449
01:01:42.852 --> 01:01:44.734
So. I caught
the first flight out

1450
01:01:44.814 --> 01:01:46.216
and here I am.

1451
01:01:46.296 --> 01:01:49.419
It's really great
to see you.
- Yeah!

1452
01:01:49.499 --> 01:01:51.941
- Yeah!
- You too.

1453
01:01:52.021 --> 01:01:53.703
- Uh. sorry.

1454
01:01:53.783 --> 01:01:55.465
I'm just a little shocked.

1455
01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:57.147
I had no idea you were coming.

1456
01:01:57.227 --> 01:01:58.868
- Yeah. I'm not surprised.

1457
01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:00.510
I booked my ticket less
than twenty-four hours ago.

1458
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:02.031
I barely had time
to tell Beth.

1459
01:02:02.112 --> 01:02:04.954
- Oh! It's... It's nice.

1460
01:02:05.034 --> 01:02:06.756
It's great. actually.

1461
01:02:06.836 --> 01:02:08.558
that you're here for Christmas.

1462
01:02:08.638 --> 01:02:10.280
- Yeah.

1463
01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.722
(♪♪♪)

1464
01:02:12.802 --> 01:02:15.085
You know. I owe
you an apology.

1465
01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:18.808
I didn't handle
things very well.
- What things?

1466
01:02:18.888 --> 01:02:20.490
- Well. the breakup. for one.

1467
01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.693
I kind of stayed together
out of habit.

1468
01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:25.575
I should have been
more honest with you.

1469
01:02:25.655 --> 01:02:27.817
- Yeah.

1470
01:02:27.897 --> 01:02:29.579
I appreciate that.
thank you.

1471
01:02:29.659 --> 01:02:31.701
But. look. I...

1472
01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:33.303
I own part of it too.

1473
01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:36.146
and it's all
for the best. right?

1474
01:02:36.226 --> 01:02:37.667
- Yeah.

1475
01:02:37.747 --> 01:02:39.349
Well. I never meant
to hurt you.

1476
01:02:39.429 --> 01:02:42.392
- Thank you.

1477
01:02:42.472 --> 01:02:44.674
But. uh...

1478
01:02:44.754 --> 01:02:46.516
when did Beth entered
the picture?

1479
01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.558
- Oh. that... that was
months after.

1480
01:02:48.638 --> 01:02:50.200
That had nothing to do
with us breaking up.

1481
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.642
She was concerned about
how you were gonna take it.

1482
01:02:52.722 --> 01:02:55.165
She kept saying she didn't
wanna hurt you

1483
01:02:55.245 --> 01:02:58.168
and she's worried
about the whole...
- No. I know.

1484
01:02:58.248 --> 01:02:59.689
Beth and I talked.

1485
01:02:59.769 --> 01:03:01.171
We're all good.

1486
01:03:01.251 --> 01:03:02.932
- Good! I'm glad!

1487
01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:04.534
You know. Beth was telling
me how relieved she is

1488
01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.656
to have
her friend back.
- Yeah.

1489
01:03:06.736 --> 01:03:10.220
- She could never plan
a wedding without you.
- Uhm?

1490
01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:11.701
- Oh. dang! Uh!

1491
01:03:11.781 --> 01:03:14.023
She didn't tell you?

1492
01:03:14.103 --> 01:03:16.506
We're engaged.
- Hum.

1493
01:03:16.586 --> 01:03:17.947
No.

1494
01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:20.710
No. she did not
mention that.

1495
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:22.552
Uh!

1496
01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:25.275
Uh! It must be just one more
thing that slipped her mind.

1497
01:03:25.355 --> 01:03:27.317
- Alex...
- No. it's fine.

1498
01:03:27.397 --> 01:03:29.399
Good night. Jesse.
- I'm sure
she would've.

1499
01:03:32.121 --> 01:03:33.763
(Christmas music)

1500
01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.605
- You're okay back there?

1501
01:03:35.685 --> 01:03:37.967
- Uh. yeah.

1502
01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:40.049
Yeah. I'm good.

1503
01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:54.624
- Oh. nice tree!

1504
01:03:57.387 --> 01:03:58.948
(sigh of relief from Andy)

1505
01:03:59.028 --> 01:04:01.511
- Can we decorate it now?
- Not till
later. bud.

1506
01:04:01.591 --> 01:04:04.554
Remember. tradition: we do it
the night of Christmas Eve.

1507
01:04:04.634 --> 01:04:06.276
- It's not called
Christmas Eve. dad.

1508
01:04:06.356 --> 01:04:08.638
it's called
<i>Heiliger Abend.</i>
- Right. of course.

1509
01:04:08.718 --> 01:04:10.600
<i>Heiliger "Abeden".</i>

1510
01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.682
- (Caroline): Haha.

1511
01:04:13.203 --> 01:04:16.085
- Mum. When were you
gonna tell me?

1512
01:04:16.165 --> 01:04:18.167
- What are you referring to?

1513
01:04:18.248 --> 01:04:19.969
- That Beth and Jesse
are getting married.

1514
01:04:20.049 --> 01:04:22.852
You know he's here. right?
- Yes. I saw him last night.

1515
01:04:22.932 --> 01:04:25.335
- Alex. don't get
so worked up. we just...

1516
01:04:25.415 --> 01:04:26.936
- Wait. you knew too?

1517
01:04:27.016 --> 01:04:28.458
Oh!

1518
01:04:28.538 --> 01:04:30.700
I can't believe this!

1519
01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.942
- Ha! I'll be right back.

1520
01:04:33.022 --> 01:04:35.425
Alex. stop!

1521
01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:38.508
Wait. let me
talk to you.

1522
01:04:38.588 --> 01:04:41.951
Look. honey. don't blow
this out of proportion!

1523
01:04:42.031 --> 01:04:43.633
I'm sure Beth was
gonna tell you!

1524
01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.715
- But you and Andy knew.

1525
01:04:45.795 --> 01:04:47.237
and you guys weren't
gonna say anything?

1526
01:04:47.317 --> 01:04:48.758
- It wasn't our news
to share!

1527
01:04:48.838 --> 01:04:50.280
I'm sorry!

1528
01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.041
- I just got to a good place

1529
01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.563
with my best friend.

1530
01:04:53.643 --> 01:04:55.204
but another secret. I...

1531
01:04:55.285 --> 01:04:57.607
- Oh. honey!

1532
01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:01.611
- Is Alex okay?

1533
01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:03.533
- Yeah. Yeah.
she's fine.

1534
01:05:03.613 --> 01:05:05.295
Things are just
a little bit tense

1535
01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:08.177
with the Christmas
preparations.
- Ha.

1536
01:05:08.258 --> 01:05:11.220
- That's a cool
looking wolf.
- Thanks.

1537
01:05:12.181 --> 01:05:15.865
(door)

1538
01:05:21.391 --> 01:05:23.753
- Hey.

1539
01:05:23.833 --> 01:05:26.356
Is. uh. everything okay?

1540
01:05:26.436 --> 01:05:28.438
I heard you talking
to your mum.

1541
01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.642
- Beth used to be
my best friend.

1542
01:05:34.123 --> 01:05:36.205
But when she started
seeing my ex...

1543
01:05:36.286 --> 01:05:38.928
Things are little
different now. so...

1544
01:05:39.008 --> 01:05:41.010
I just don't know
if I can trust her anymore.

1545
01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:45.214
- I hope that you guys
can repair things.

1546
01:05:45.295 --> 01:05:46.696
- I don't know.

1547
01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.298
- You know.
best friends.

1548
01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:50.540
they're pretty hard to come by.

1549
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:54.023
Especially ones that you've
known for that long.

1550
01:05:54.103 --> 01:05:56.105
And you'll never find someone
that shares your life.

1551
01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:58.708
or knows your history
like she does.

1552
01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.790
It's not
my place. but...

1553
01:06:02.472 --> 01:06:04.474
don't lose your best friend.

1554
01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.358
Hey!

1555
01:06:08.438 --> 01:06:11.000
What do you say we get you
a Swiss hot chocolate?

1556
01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:14.243
- Sounds good.

1557
01:06:14.324 --> 01:06:18.368
(♪♪♪)

1558
01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:21.811
- The stars.

1559
01:06:21.891 --> 01:06:24.854

Hey! I've got a secret
mission for you.

1563

"Silent Night" tonight!

it's totally up to you

1571
01:07:01.811 --> 01:07:04.053
and I don't know
how to play the piano.

but we can play
the music on my phone?

1573
01:07:05.655 --> 01:07:07.657

happy too.

I would be honoured!

1579

Well. I'm just hoping
he can keep a secret

1597
01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:56.466
as well as you can.

1598
01:07:56.546 --> 01:08:00.189
- Alex! That's not it.
I wanted to tell you

1599
01:08:00.269 --> 01:08:01.991
as soon as you
forgave me. but...

1600
01:08:02.071 --> 01:08:03.633
- What?

1601
01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:06.636
- I just wanted to
enjoy the mument.

1602
01:08:07.597 --> 01:08:09.599
- Yeah.

1603
01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:13.683
But. look. you have
to understand how awful it was

1604
01:08:13.763 --> 01:08:16.045
to hear the news from Jesse
instead of from you.

1605
01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.567
- I know and I told Jesse

1606
01:08:17.647 --> 01:08:19.048
I wanted to be
the one to tell you.

1607
01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:20.690
but he just couldn't
keep it quiet.

1608
01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:22.251
he's such
a blabbermouth!
- Ha.

1609
01:08:22.331 --> 01:08:24.654
Jesse has always been
a bit of a blabbermouth

1610
01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:26.976
from what I recall.

1611
01:08:27.056 --> 01:08:29.819
- I'm sorry. from the bottom
of my heart.

1612
01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:32.622

think that he was ready.

but you can't be
so scared. you know.

1689

1690
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:03.152
- Kelby is stronger
than you think.

1691
01:12:03.232 --> 01:12:05.034
He can handle this. okay?

1692
01:12:05.114 --> 01:12:06.676
- No. he can't!

1693
01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:08.397
He can't handle
any more loss!

1694
01:12:08.477 --> 01:12:10.119
And I don't want him
to get attached to someone

1695
01:12:10.199 --> 01:12:11.640
who's gonna one day
walk out of his life

1696
01:12:11.721 --> 01:12:13.803
and he's never
gonna see again!

1697
01:12:13.883 --> 01:12:15.484
Your job is your life!

1698
01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:19.168
And next month. you're gonna
be in Australia or Argentina.

- I'm sorry. I know that you're
trying to do the right thing.

1703

1704

Come here!

why Liam's so mad at me!

1718
01:13:17.146 --> 01:13:19.468
Was I that out of line
for having Kelby sing?

1719
01:13:19.548 --> 01:13:20.950
- Of course not!

1720
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.792
You were just trying
to help. and you did.

1721
01:13:22.872 --> 01:13:24.874
Kelby did great.

1722
01:13:24.954 --> 01:13:27.196
I think Liam is just
being protective.

1723
01:13:27.276 --> 01:13:28.918
But kids are so much
more resilient

1724
01:13:28.998 --> 01:13:30.719
than we parents
sometimes think.

1725
01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.201
Ha!

1726
01:13:32.281 --> 01:13:34.683
I bet this all blows
over by morning.

1727
01:13:34.764 --> 01:13:37.406
You and Liam are gonna be
just fine. you'll see.

1728
01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:43.172
- Ha. Maybe it's better
if we're not fine.

1729
01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.693
- What do you mean?

1730
01:13:44.774 --> 01:13:47.056
Do you not like Liam?

1731
01:13:47.136 --> 01:13:48.858
- No. of course. I...

1732
01:13:48.938 --> 01:13:50.379
I really like Liam.

1733
01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:52.661
I... I like him a lot.

1734
01:13:52.741 --> 01:13:54.583
- Then. what's the problem?

1735
01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:57.386
- What are the chances
that this works out?

1736
01:13:57.466 --> 01:13:59.789
We live half a world apart.

1737
01:13:59.869 --> 01:14:01.270
we have completely
different lives.

1738
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:02.992
- Oh! Sweetheart.
it's early.

1739
01:14:03.072 --> 01:14:05.474
you don't have to make any
serious decisions right now!

1740
01:14:05.554 --> 01:14:06.996
- Well. maybe it's better
if I call it off

1741
01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:08.998
before it gets serious.

1742
01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:10.559
- You want to call it off

1743
01:14:10.639 --> 01:14:12.842
before you've even have
the chance to figure out

1744
01:14:12.922 --> 01:14:14.804
if you could be
something great.

1745
01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:16.886
- What if we are
something great?

1746
01:14:16.966 --> 01:14:18.527
It's only gonna make it
that much harder

1747
01:14:18.607 --> 01:14:20.009
when it doesn't work out.

1748
01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:21.931
(Caroline sighs.)

1749
01:14:22.011 --> 01:14:26.055
- Sweetheart. I know how hard
it is to put yourself out there

1750
01:14:26.135 --> 01:14:29.618
and I know how hard it is
to have your heart broken.

1751
01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:31.140
When your dad passed away.

1752
01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:33.542
my heart splintered into
a million little pieces.

1753
01:14:33.622 --> 01:14:35.825
but you know what?

1754
01:14:37.026 --> 01:14:39.348
I'd take that heartbreak
all over again

1755
01:14:39.428 --> 01:14:41.430
if it meant one more
minute with your dad.

1756
01:14:43.232 --> 01:14:45.314
Liam is an amazing man.

1757
01:14:45.394 --> 01:14:47.156
You are an amazing woman

1758
01:14:47.236 --> 01:14:49.078
and I just don't want
to see either of you

1759
01:14:49.158 --> 01:14:50.639
throw away your futures

1760
01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:52.882
because you're so stuck
on the past.

1761
01:14:54.163 --> 01:14:55.604
- Yeah.

1762
01:14:55.684 --> 01:14:57.967
- Get some sleep.

1763
01:14:58.047 --> 01:15:00.329
You'll feel better
in the morning.
- Okay.

1764
01:15:00.409 --> 01:15:02.051
(♪♪♪)

1765
01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:04.133
- Ha!

1766
01:15:04.213 --> 01:15:09.258
(birds signing)

1767
01:15:14.183 --> 01:15:16.665
- Hey! Merry Christmas.

1768
01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:18.507
- Merry Christmas.

1769
01:15:18.587 --> 01:15:21.510
Although. it doesn't
feel very merry.

1770
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:24.954
- You gonna patch
things up with Liam?

1771
01:15:26.635 --> 01:15:29.118
- I don't know.

1772
01:15:29.198 --> 01:15:32.521
I mean. Liam's entire life
is here in Wengen.

1773
01:15:32.601 --> 01:15:34.403
What am I gonna do.
move here?

1774
01:15:34.483 --> 01:15:36.125
Give up my whole life
in Chicago.

1775
01:15:36.205 --> 01:15:38.007
stop travelling the world
and having adventures?

1776
01:15:38.087 --> 01:15:41.891
- First of all. you've only
known him for like two weeks.

1777
01:15:41.971 --> 01:15:43.452
So. maybe slow your roll
just a little.

1778
01:15:43.532 --> 01:15:45.814
- Ha! Yeah!

1779
01:15:45.895 --> 01:15:47.616
- And secondly. just because
you're with someone.

1780
01:15:47.696 --> 01:15:50.499
it doesn't mean you have
to give up having adventures.

1781
01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:52.621
And you never know
what the future holds.

1782
01:15:52.701 --> 01:15:54.823
Maybe Liam would
move to Chicago.
- Hmm!

1783
01:15:54.904 --> 01:15:56.785
- Or you both move
somewhere else.

1784
01:15:56.865 --> 01:15:58.467
Look at mum.

1785
01:15:58.547 --> 01:16:01.510
she moved to Switzerland.
opened this inn.
- Ha!

1786
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.392
- Could you ever imagine
she'd do something like this?

1787
01:16:03.472 --> 01:16:06.275
- No. No. I did not see
this one coming.
- Hum.

1788
01:16:06.355 --> 01:16:08.877
It's like mum always says.
it's never too late...

1789
01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:11.680
- To start
a new adventure.
- Ha!

1790
01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.162
I guess it all comes down

1791
01:16:13.242 --> 01:16:16.445
to what you want
out of your life.

1792
01:16:16.525 --> 01:16:19.248
Do you wanna keep it safe
and never get hurt?

1793
01:16:19.328 --> 01:16:21.850
Or do you want

1794
01:16:21.931 --> 01:16:24.853
a life that is as full
as it can possibly be?

1795
01:16:24.934 --> 01:16:26.495
- Oh.

1796
01:16:26.575 --> 01:16:28.057
- Besides. what good
is an adventure

1797
01:16:28.137 --> 01:16:30.899
if you have no one
to share it with?

1798
01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:34.063
- Yeah.

1799
01:16:34.143 --> 01:16:36.465
You're right.

1800
01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.203
(Christmas music)

1801
01:16:58.287 --> 01:17:00.169
Hey. Liam.

1802
01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:02.011
- Hey. Alex.

1803
01:17:02.091 --> 01:17:05.134
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1804
01:17:06.215 --> 01:17:08.017
- Yeah. thanks.

1805
01:17:08.097 --> 01:17:09.498
- We're just...

1806
01:17:09.578 --> 01:17:11.780
We're opening
some presents.

1807
01:17:13.983 --> 01:17:15.664
- I didn't wanna
interrupt.

1808
01:17:15.744 --> 01:17:17.946
but I just wanted
to come by.

1809
01:17:18.027 --> 01:17:20.269
Uh!

1810
01:17:20.349 --> 01:17:22.951
I just really wanted
to apologise for last night.

1811
01:17:23.032 --> 01:17:26.435
I'm really sorry.

1812
01:17:26.515 --> 01:17:27.916
I should have asked you

1813
01:17:27.997 --> 01:17:29.438
if it was okay
for Kelby to sing

1814
01:17:29.518 --> 01:17:31.120
and I really overstepped
my bounds. so...

1815
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.681
- Alex...

1816
01:17:32.761 --> 01:17:34.163
- No. you are his dad.

1817
01:17:34.243 --> 01:17:37.166
you know.
you know him best.

1818
01:17:37.246 --> 01:17:38.847
And I should've
respected that.

1819
01:17:38.927 --> 01:17:40.569
- It's okay.

1820
01:17:40.649 --> 01:17:42.651
I forgive you.

1821
01:17:43.612 --> 01:17:45.254
- You do?
- Yeah.

1822
01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:49.098
In fact. I was gonna go
and apologise to you today.

1823
01:17:49.178 --> 01:17:52.341
I overreacted.
I'm sorry.

1824
01:17:52.421 --> 01:17:56.985
I'm still trying to navigate
this whole single dad thing.

1825
01:17:58.227 --> 01:18:01.870
- Yeah. Ha. no apology
needed. it's okay.

1826
01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:06.115
- By the way. you were
totally right. Ha!

1827
01:18:06.195 --> 01:18:10.119
Kelby was definitely
ready to sing again.

1828
01:18:10.199 --> 01:18:11.880
He's been talking about

1829
01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.243
last night's
performance non-stop.

1830
01:18:14.323 --> 01:18:17.326
- Oh! Oh. that's sweet.

1831
01:18:17.406 --> 01:18:19.968
- Yeah. we took out
some old photos

1832
01:18:20.049 --> 01:18:22.611
and we've been
reminiscing all morning.

1833
01:18:22.691 --> 01:18:26.935
And that's because of you.
so thank you.

1834
01:18:27.015 --> 01:18:29.778
- You're welcome.

1835
01:18:29.858 --> 01:18:33.822
- Alex. I really
care about you

1836
01:18:33.902 --> 01:18:36.185
and the time
that you spent here

1837
01:18:36.265 --> 01:18:39.068
has just been wonderful.

1838
01:18:41.029 --> 01:18:43.952
But Kelby. he's getting
really attached to you

1839
01:18:44.032 --> 01:18:46.675
and you're gonna be
leaving soon. so...

1840
01:18:49.078 --> 01:18:50.919
- Yeah.

1841
01:18:50.999 --> 01:18:53.162
I get it.

1842
01:18:54.203 --> 01:18:56.004
Hahaha! Hey!

1843
01:18:56.085 --> 01:18:57.486
- Merry Christmas. Alex!

1844
01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.488
- Merry Christmas. Kelby!

1845
01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.170
- Don't you want to come
open the presents with us?

1846
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:04.133
- Oh! Well. uh.
you know.

1847
01:19:04.213 --> 01:19:07.696
I would love to.
but I gotta to get back

1848
01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:09.898
to the inn.

1849
01:19:09.978 --> 01:19:12.060
so maybe later.
- Okay.

1850
01:19:16.024 --> 01:19:17.706
- I should... should
probably go.

1851
01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:20.389
- Yeah. sure. okay.

1852
01:19:23.152 --> 01:19:24.593
- Bye. Liam.

1853
01:19:24.673 --> 01:19:27.396
- Bye. Alex.

1854
01:19:42.411 --> 01:19:47.136
(♪♪♪)

1855
01:19:49.858 --> 01:19:54.863
(bells)

1856
01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:08.036
(♪♪♪)

1857
01:20:14.483 --> 01:20:16.925
- I just can't
believe it's over.

1858
01:20:19.408 --> 01:20:21.250
- You'll be okay.

1859
01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:23.572
Promise.

1860
01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.133
- Yeah.

1861
01:20:25.214 --> 01:20:27.656
It's just...
I thought he'd think

1862
01:20:27.736 --> 01:20:29.578
we were worth a shot.
you know?

1863
01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:31.540
- Yeah.

1864
01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:35.103
- Ha! It's gonna be really
hard to say bye to Kelby.

1865
01:20:35.184 --> 01:20:36.745
I'm gonna miss that little guy.

1866
01:20:36.825 --> 01:20:39.348
- Maybe you could do
something nice for Kelby.

1867
01:20:39.428 --> 01:20:40.829
give him a parting gift.

1868
01:20:40.909 --> 01:20:43.632
- Yeah. that's a good idea.

1869
01:20:43.712 --> 01:20:45.914
- His mum died. right?

1870
01:20:45.994 --> 01:20:47.716
Maybe something
to remember her by?

1871
01:20:47.796 --> 01:20:51.079
- I think I know just the thing.

1872
01:20:51.159 --> 01:20:52.561
Would you help me with it?

1873
01:20:52.641 --> 01:20:54.082
- Of course.
whatever you need!

1874
01:20:54.162 --> 01:20:56.365
- Okay! Great!

1875
01:20:56.445 --> 01:21:00.969
(♪♪♪)

1876
01:21:03.612 --> 01:21:07.336
- Okay! Make sure everyone
has a flute for the toast!

1877
01:21:07.416 --> 01:21:09.258
I've got apple cider
for the kids!

1878
01:21:09.338 --> 01:21:10.899
There you go.
sweetheart.

1879
01:21:10.979 --> 01:21:12.981
- Thank you
so much!

1880
01:21:14.383 --> 01:21:15.784
- Okay.

1881
01:21:15.864 --> 01:21:17.906
Are you gonna give
Kelby his gift now?

1882
01:21:17.986 --> 01:21:20.749
- Yeah. Yeah.
but I got

1883
01:21:20.829 --> 01:21:22.751
a few things I need
to say to Liam first.

1884
01:21:22.831 --> 01:21:24.313
Will you watch it
for me?

1885
01:21:24.393 --> 01:21:27.396
- Yeah. of course.
- Alright.

1886
01:21:28.357 --> 01:21:30.239
- Cheers!

1887
01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:32.761
- Here goes nothing.

1888
01:21:32.841 --> 01:21:34.723
- You got it.

1889
01:21:34.803 --> 01:21:37.846
(♪♪♪)

1890
01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:40.128
- Haha!

1891
01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:42.811
Hey!
- Hey.
Alex.

1892
01:21:44.172 --> 01:21:46.855
- Uh! I...

1893
01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:50.299
I just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

1894
01:21:50.379 --> 01:21:53.061
This Christmas has
been really magical

1895
01:21:53.141 --> 01:21:57.466
and maybe even a little
life changing for me.

1896
01:21:57.546 --> 01:21:59.868
And I really
didn't realise

1897
01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:01.470
all the things that I was
missing in my life

1898
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:04.993
until I met you.
so thank you.

1899
01:22:05.073 --> 01:22:06.915
- Wow!

1900
01:22:06.995 --> 01:22:08.557
You're welcome.

1901
01:22:08.637 --> 01:22:11.320
- And I wanted
to let you know

1902
01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.562
that I'm gonna be staying in
Switzerland for a little while.

1903
01:22:13.642 --> 01:22:17.646
help my mum out
with the inn.

1904
01:22:17.726 --> 01:22:20.369
maybe put down some roots
again a little bit.

1905
01:22:20.449 --> 01:22:22.130
trying to figure out
who I am.

1906
01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:24.293
Spend more time
with the people I love.

1907
01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:27.896
I promise. though.

1908
01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:29.418
I will steer clear of you.

1909
01:22:29.498 --> 01:22:30.899
I'll stay out of your way.

1910
01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:33.982
I won't be a problem.

1911
01:22:34.062 --> 01:22:35.944
- So. you'll be staying
for the opening?

1912
01:22:36.024 --> 01:22:38.387
- Yeah! I mean. you didn't
think I'll let you

1913
01:22:38.467 --> 01:22:39.908
handle this alone.
did you?

1914
01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:41.990
No offence.

1915
01:22:42.911 --> 01:22:45.033
- None taken.

1916
01:22:46.395 --> 01:22:48.036
I don't know what
to say. I...

1917
01:22:48.116 --> 01:22:50.319
- Well. you don't have
to say anything.

1918
01:22:50.399 --> 01:22:53.482
I just didn't want it
to come as a surprise.

1919
01:22:56.084 --> 01:22:57.646
- Merry Christmas!

1920
01:22:57.726 --> 01:22:59.207
- Oh! Hey. buddy!

1921
01:22:59.287 --> 01:23:00.889
Merry Christmas!

1922
01:23:00.969 --> 01:23:02.411
Are you ready for me to give
you your present now?

1923
01:23:02.491 --> 01:23:04.212
- Yeah!
- Yeah?
Alright!

1924
01:23:04.292 --> 01:23:05.734
It's right over
there on the table.

1925
01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:07.816
so come on.

1926
01:23:09.698 --> 01:23:12.060
- What is it?

1927
01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:14.182
- Well...

1928
01:23:14.262 --> 01:23:16.264
Tam-tadada!

1929
01:23:18.867 --> 01:23:20.869
It's a model
of your old house.

1930
01:23:20.949 --> 01:23:23.392
- Really?
- Uh. uh.

1931
01:23:23.472 --> 01:23:24.913
I made it from my memory
of your drawings.

1932
01:23:24.993 --> 01:23:26.835
- There's my bedroom.
- Yeah.

1933
01:23:26.915 --> 01:23:30.038
Yeah. And there
is your bed

1934
01:23:30.118 --> 01:23:31.520
and your chairs.

1935
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.802
And look.
even on the bookshelf.

1936
01:23:33.882 --> 01:23:35.844
there's some
tiny little books

1937
01:23:35.924 --> 01:23:37.766
like your mum used
to read to you.

1938
01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.608
- There's a kitchen!
- Yeah!

1939
01:23:39.688 --> 01:23:41.289
There's a kitchen and a freezer.

1940
01:23:41.370 --> 01:23:44.132
And in the freezer is
some vanilla ice cream.

1941
01:23:44.212 --> 01:23:46.895
- Her favourite.
- Uh. uh.

1942
01:23:46.975 --> 01:23:48.697
- And there's
a music room

1943
01:23:48.777 --> 01:23:51.179
with a piano.

1944
01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:53.382
- Where mum and I used
to sing together.

1945
01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:54.863
- Yeah.

1946
01:23:54.943 --> 01:23:57.185
And now. you can sing
anytime you want.

1947
01:23:57.265 --> 01:24:00.348
- Thanks. Alex. I love it.
- Ha!

1948
01:24:00.429 --> 01:24:01.910
You're welcome.

1949
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:03.872
- I have a present for you too.

1950
01:24:03.952 --> 01:24:06.114
- You do?
- I didn't know
that. Kelbs.

1951
01:24:06.194 --> 01:24:07.596
- Noah.
come on!

1952
01:24:07.676 --> 01:24:10.158
- Yeah.
let's do it!

1953
01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:15.404
- This is amazing.

1954
01:24:15.484 --> 01:24:17.486
- I'm glad you like it.

1955
01:24:24.613 --> 01:24:26.615
(exclamations)

1956
01:24:30.499 --> 01:24:32.821
- It's you. me and dad.

1957
01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.503
I wanted you
to have something

1958
01:24:34.583 --> 01:24:36.665
to remember us by.

1959
01:24:37.746 --> 01:24:39.548
- Oh.

1960
01:24:39.628 --> 01:24:41.069
Kelby. I love it!

1961
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:43.031
Ha! Thank you.

1962
01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:45.273
- Hey. come one.
let's look at the model!

1963
01:24:49.558 --> 01:24:51.079
- Wow! Ha!

1964

1965
01:24:53.842 --> 01:24:56.805
- I had no idea
he was gonna do this.

1966
01:25:00.168 --> 01:25:02.370
You know. I think
you were right.

1967
01:25:02.451 --> 01:25:03.852
- About what?

1968
01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.294
- I think there might
be something here.

1969
01:25:07.776 --> 01:25:09.818
I don't know what it is
or where it's gonna go.

1970
01:25:09.898 --> 01:25:11.620
but...

1971
01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.702
I'm willing to find out
if you are.

1972
01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:18.026
- I'm willing
to find out too.
