00:15:57.756 --> 00:15:59.224
but just stick with it. okay?

351
00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:01.360
- No murders in the building!

352
00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:05.130
- Darling. if we
wanted to kill you.

353
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.866
we would've done that already.

354
00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:10.602
- What she means is. hi.

355
00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:13.472
We're just three
regular old spirits

356
00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:15.874
who've been assigned to you
to make your life better.

357
00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:17.409
Aren't you lucky?

358
00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:22.147
I'm Sahra. your Celestial
Guide to Compassion.

359
00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:26.318
- And I'm Zero. your Celestial
Guide to Service.

360
00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:29.722
I made you your tea.
and you're welcome.

361
00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:30.956
- And I'm out.

362
00:16:30.956 --> 00:16:32.391
- Ooh!

363
00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:37.296
- Hi.
- Hey.

364
00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:40.165
- Truth. Compassion. Service.

365
00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.000
Together. we make love.

366
00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:45.671
- Look. people could do
whatever they want in private.

367
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.439
but I'm not into
that kind of thing.

368
00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:49.174
[laughter]

369
00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.976
- That was a joke!

370
00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:53.112
- Oh. Ditey. you're so funny.

371
00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:56.448
- Are you going to get a crush
on every mortal that we meet?

372
00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:58.917
- Maybe.

373
00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:00.786
Just to clarify--

374
00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:02.421
we make Love the concept.

375
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:04.823
Love that makes
life worth living.

376
00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:07.292
- All right. if y'all on some
kind of charity or something.

377
00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.427
you could reach me
through my website

378
00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:10.462
at Get Away From Me dot net.

379
00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:13.132
- Truth. Just like everyone
else in your life.

380
00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:15.801
there's so more
we'd rather be doing.

381
00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:17.336
- Then why don't you go do it?

382
00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:21.073
- Because unlike you.
we are going to do our job!

383
00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:23.976
- All right.

384
00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.411
So y'all are magical.

385
00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.012
- [gasps] She said magical.
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:29.148
- I think she's getting it.
Can I please ladies?

387
00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:30.382
- After you.

388
00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:36.155
- Christmas is about love.

389
00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:37.656
and you've lost it.

390
00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:39.958
You're not giving it.
you're not receiving it.

391
00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.460
We're here to help
you get it back.

392
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.529
- Christmas is not about love.

393
00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:45.664
Christmas is like
every other day.

394
00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:47.533
People looking out
for themselves.

395
00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:50.536
And maybe on Christmas
you get good food.

396
00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:52.538
maybe some cool lotion
or whatever.

397
00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:55.507
- So girlfriend.
just a real quick protip.

398
00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:58.577
No one can see us but you.

399
00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:01.313
- So see. you can do
whatever you want.

400
00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:04.183
We were just trying
to save you from...

401
00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:05.317
this.

402
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.122
Hello?

403
00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:14.493
Anyone?
[huffs]

404
00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:17.763
You see. Aphrodite.
this is how it will end up.

405
00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:18.997
This is it.

406
00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:20.899
- Where am I?

407
00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:25.537
It's cold. scary. and foggy.

408
00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:27.272
- This is what happens
to people

409
00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:30.375
who don't let love
into their lives.

410
00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:33.245
Aphrodite. look around.

411
00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:35.581
This is what happens.

412
00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:38.016
You have to let love into
your life. Aphrodite.

413
00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:39.585
- You're wasting your time.

414
00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:41.687
I don't care about Christmas.

415
00:18:41.687 --> 00:18:43.622
I don't care about any of this.

416
00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:46.959
- Oh. so you think you can lie
to the Spirit of Truth?

417
00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.495
Let's see how you really
feel about Christmas.

418
00:18:52.874 --> 00:18:55.343
- Oh Gosh.
Can you guys stop doing that?

419
00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.245
I get carsick
or magic sick. whatever.

420
00:18:57.245 --> 00:18:58.846
- No. well.

421
00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.448
if you need something
to throw up on.

422
00:19:00.448 --> 00:19:02.884
then you can just
throw it right on here.

423
00:19:02.884 --> 00:19:05.386
- What are we doing here?

424
00:19:05.386 --> 00:19:07.855
- Like I said.
learning the truth.

425
00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:12.960
- Oh my God. is that me?

426
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.129
- Look. I made it shiny.

427
00:19:15.129 --> 00:19:17.598
- It's so cute.
[both giggling]

428
00:19:18.766 --> 00:19:21.669
- What the hell is that?

429
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:24.205
- I made 'em myself.
- How...

430
00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:25.373
dare you!

431
00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:28.342
Did I ask you to do that?

432
00:19:28.342 --> 00:19:30.912
Answer me when I talk to you.
Angela Wilkins.

433
00:19:30.912 --> 00:19:32.513
- No. ma'am.

434
00:19:32.513 --> 00:19:36.050
- Angela. I haven't heard
that name in forever.

435
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.486
- You make this place so ugly

436
00:19:38.486 --> 00:19:40.488
for my dinner with my partners.

437
00:19:40.488 --> 00:19:42.423
Are you trying to embarrass me?

438
00:19:42.423 --> 00:19:44.959
- I'm sorry. I just thought--

439
00:19:44.959 --> 00:19:46.527
- No. you didn't.

440
00:19:46.527 --> 00:19:50.431
You don't think--not about
anyone but your selfish self.

441
00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:53.200
You are so lucky
I am your mother

442
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.404
and I have to love you because
no one else ever could.

443
00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.075
And make sure that
this room is cleaned up

444
00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:02.777
before that doorbell rings.

445
00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.151
- Bastia.
- Bastia.

446
00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:15.056
- So we're here... why?

447
00:20:15.056 --> 00:20:17.558
- 'Cause you said that you
don't care about Christmas

448
00:20:17.558 --> 00:20:18.926
or love.

449
00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:20.161
It's not true.

450
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:22.630
You always cared.

451
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.198
- I was ten.

452
00:20:24.198 --> 00:20:26.434
I had an arts
and crafts project.

453
00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.569
That doesn't mean
I wanted the Christmas spirit

454
00:20:28.569 --> 00:20:30.171
to come to our family.

455
00:20:30.171 --> 00:20:32.840
- Then why did you write that
exact thing in your diary?

456
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.975
Hmm?

457
00:20:33.975 --> 00:20:36.711
- So I wrote one dumb wish.

458
00:20:36.711 --> 00:20:38.546
I was ten.

459
00:20:38.546 --> 00:20:40.247
- You also wrote it...

460
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:45.152
At 12...

461
00:20:45.152 --> 00:20:46.954
then again at 14.

462
00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:49.023
and then again...

463
00:20:49.023 --> 00:20:50.424
at 16.

464
00:20:50.424 --> 00:20:53.627
- And I even saw you
put something like that

465
00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:55.529
in your notes app last year.

466
00:20:55.529 --> 00:20:57.431
- So that sound like
five to me.

467
00:20:57.431 --> 00:20:59.900
- You think you're slick.
- We--nah. we not slick.

468
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.736
'Cause slick
is like clever. right?

469
00:21:01.736 --> 00:21:04.438
And we tested in the Pantheon
for cleverness

470
00:21:04.438 --> 00:21:06.507
and we barely made like
the 50th percentile.

471
00:21:06.507 --> 00:21:08.709
But I am very
excited to say

472
00:21:08.709 --> 00:21:10.578
that I made the first
percentile for killer smile.

473
00:21:10.578 --> 00:21:12.780
Look at my gums.
They contoured.

474
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.448
Look.

475
00:21:14.448 --> 00:21:16.584
I'm showing her my gums.
[Bahira muttering. annoyed]

476
00:21:16.584 --> 00:21:19.920
- You wanted a Christmas
spirit. and you got three.

477
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.455
Aren't you lucky?

478
00:21:21.455 --> 00:21:23.257
- Stop acting like
you don't care about

479
00:21:23.257 --> 00:21:24.658
this time of the year.

480
00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:26.961
because
it's obvious that you did

481
00:21:26.961 --> 00:21:28.662
and you still do.

482
00:21:30.898 --> 00:21:34.101
- And show that little girl
some compassion.

483
00:21:34.101 --> 00:21:36.504
She's still a part of you

484
00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:39.940
and she deserves
all the love she never got.

485
00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:44.412
Take care of the people
in your life

486
00:21:44.412 --> 00:21:48.349
the way that you wanted
to be taken care of.

487
00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:50.384
That's love.

488
00:21:50.384 --> 00:21:51.952
<i>[echoing] That's love...</i>

489
00:21:51.952 --> 00:21:53.587
<i>That's love...</i>

490
00:21:56.524 --> 00:22:00.261
- That settles it--
no more cheap wine!

491
00:22:03.831 --> 00:22:05.599
Let's go!

492
00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:07.101
- Everybody check your mics.

493
00:22:07.101 --> 00:22:10.104
- Okay. I was raised to be
thankful for everything.

494
00:22:10.104 --> 00:22:13.040
but respectfully.

495
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.675
are we sure this is for me?

496
00:22:14.675 --> 00:22:15.810
- Okay.
You know what?

497
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.445
Sorry. I just need
to say something.

498
00:22:17.445 --> 00:22:18.879
- No. it's okay.
Baby. it's okay.

499
00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:21.115
- No. no. no. no. no. no.
This girl is super talented.

500
00:22:21.115 --> 00:22:22.817
She has a beautiful vibe.

501
00:22:22.817 --> 00:22:26.253
We didn't come all this way
for you to ruin all of that.

502
00:22:26.253 --> 00:22:28.389
- And that...

503
00:22:29.423 --> 00:22:32.026
is why the greats work alone.

504
00:22:32.026 --> 00:22:33.861
She's lucky I'm even
working with her.

505
00:22:33.861 --> 00:22:35.229
Nobody else would.

506
00:22:35.229 --> 00:22:37.331
- What?
- It's okay. I'm fine.

507
00:22:37.331 --> 00:22:39.533
It's fine.
- Alexandria.

508
00:22:40.835 --> 00:22:42.503
- It's Antonia.
- What?

509
00:22:42.503 --> 00:22:44.705
- Nothing.
- Get rid of her.

510
00:22:44.705 --> 00:22:46.874
- You say that like you want
to kill me or something.

511
00:22:46.874 --> 00:22:49.210
- Well. now that
you mention it...

512
00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.878
- No--
- Is that a threat?

513
00:22:50.878 --> 00:22:52.313
- No. I'm just gonna--
Kyra.

514
00:22:52.313 --> 00:22:54.248
Yeah. I'm gonna take her out.
I'll be right back.

515
00:22:54.248 --> 00:22:55.549
It's okay.

516
00:22:57.318 --> 00:22:58.919
- Our set looks like
a nightmare.

517
00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:00.821
Our star singer
looks miserable.

518
00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:02.623
What is the theme
you're going for exactly--

519
00:23:02.623 --> 00:23:03.691
Christmas in Hell?

520
00:23:03.691 --> 00:23:05.126
- Christmas is hell.

521
00:23:05.126 --> 00:23:07.361
- Only Because
you're making it that way.

522
00:23:08.996 --> 00:23:11.031
You used to believe in
the Christmas spirit.

523
00:23:11.031 --> 00:23:12.399

would stick around

the rest of your clothes off.

- Sorry. no.

so much more than an apology.

- Okay.

take this number

I wrote a song.

a prayer. really.

1501
01:11:57.543 --> 01:12:00.380
that love would be everything

1502
01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.515
I could ever hope for.

1503
01:12:02.515 --> 01:12:04.651
But because it was scary.

1504
01:12:04.651 --> 01:12:07.720
I allowed my love to be
corrupted

1505
01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:12.091
and I hurt people
because of it.

1506
01:12:12.091 --> 01:12:15.128
I wanted the song
pulled from the show

1507
01:12:15.128 --> 01:12:21.034
because it hurt
so much to hear it.

1508
01:12:21.034 --> 01:12:27.674
And I missed what I once had.

1509
01:12:27.674 --> 01:12:32.345
And I'm terrified that
I'll never feel it again.

1510
01:12:32.345 --> 01:12:37.917
But love isn't just about
me getting something for me.

1511
01:12:37.917 --> 01:12:40.386
It's about giving.

1512
01:12:40.386 --> 01:12:45.825
It's about showing love
to the cast and crew

1513
01:12:45.825 --> 01:12:48.161
that make this life possible.

1514
01:12:51.297 --> 01:12:55.935
To my best friend
who I owe so much.

1515
01:12:55.935 --> 01:13:00.373
To the person that tried
to stand by my side.

1516
01:13:00.373 --> 01:13:06.345
even though I pushed him
away over and over and over.

1517
01:13:06.345 --> 01:13:10.717
Originally. I asked
the universe to make

1518
01:13:10.717 --> 01:13:14.420
this song bring me love.

1519
01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:20.126
And now I'm committing myself
to showing love to anyone

1520
01:13:20.126 --> 01:13:24.864
and everyone who needs it.

1521
01:13:24.864 --> 01:13:29.202
There's a Christmas special
tomorrow for this show.

1522
01:13:29.202 --> 01:13:33.773
And because of some of the
dumb things that I did.

1523
01:13:33.773 --> 01:13:38.878
what you were going to see is
not what this song is about.

1524
01:13:38.878 --> 01:13:42.749
And because I got
fired today.

1525
01:13:42.749 --> 01:13:46.486
I wasn't able to do
anything about that except
