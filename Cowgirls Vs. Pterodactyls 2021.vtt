00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:31.459
NARRATOR: The time was 1864.

4
00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:39.334
The place: The Wild West

5
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:46.792
An unbridled age of heroes and villains.

6
00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.959
Sheriffs and outlaws.

7
00:00:51.292 --> 00:00:55.626
A land overflowing with water. game. timber

8
00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:01.876
...and creatures from a bygone
and forgotten age of history.

9
00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:10.250
Even now. modern
scholars refuse to accept the

10
00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:14.000
possibility that these
events actually occurred.

11
00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:16.334
But they did.

12
00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:19.959
For an entire year the Wild West

13
00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:24.584
was terrorized by these
flying devils from Hell.

14
00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:29.209
The creatures attacked
furiously and without motive.

15
00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:34.292
They showed no signs of weakness
and it was finally proclaimed

16
00:01:34.292 --> 00:01:37.751
that they were invulnerable.

17
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.167
They were indeed pterodactyls.

18
00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:49.167
Creatures that no man could stop.

19
00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:49.667
Our story begins on a dark and stormy night

20
00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.209
in the rustic town of Kirksey. Texas

21
00:02:53.584 --> 00:02:56.459
home to the Debbie Dukes Bordello.

22
00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:58.042
(thunder crash)

23
00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.667
(saloon piano playing)

24
00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:06.209
(laughter)

25
00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:13.459
So. I could do my sword trick for you...

26
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.834
(outside door opens)

27
00:03:25.042 --> 00:03:28.042
I'm looking for the man
they call: "The Outlaw"

28
00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:31.334
They call me...

29
00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.209
(drinks)

30
00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:34.626
"The Outlaw".

31
00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.834
(piano music stops abruptly)

32
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.209
Take a seat. partner.

33
00:03:44.876 --> 00:03:46.083
(thunder crash)

34
00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:53.459
(wind and rain)

35
00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.292
Well. I better be hittin'
the ol' dusty trail...

36
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.876
Hold on. partner!

37
00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:10.500
You're among friends... have a seat.

38
00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:11.542
I mean...

39
00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.626
SIT. DOWN.

40
00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:19.876
(chair squeaks)

41
00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:24.667
You got 'em?

42
00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:28.709
I traveled more than 600 miles over
the Chisos and Chinte Mountains...

43
00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:33.626
...ahead of all them Mescal.
Comanche. and Apache for four months.

44
00:04:34.626 --> 00:04:37.042
Oh. yeah. I got 'em.

45
00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:43.542
(thunder rumbles)

46
00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:48.209
Oh. they're beautiful.

47
00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:53.083
That they are. That they are.

48
00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:58.792
I'll tell you what: It took a
whole helluva lot to get 'em here.

49
00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:01.792
They said you'd be the man for the job.

50
00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:02.834
(laughter)

51
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.709
(nervous laughter)

52
00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:10.042
(laughter continues)

53
00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:16.542
I can count on one hand the
fellas that coulda pulled this off.

54
00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:23.667
And I'm counting on you to
take that into consideration

55
00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:25.959
in FULL payment.

56
00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.918
I reckon you'll get what's coming to you.

57
00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:31.959
(gun cocks)

58
00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:35.584
(tense music)

59
00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:39.918
(another gun cocks)

60
00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:48.751
(tense music continues)

61
00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:51.667
(laughter)

62
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:57.000
(laughing rises)

63
00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:01.125
(several gunshots)

64
00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:13.792
I'm okay!

65
00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:23.125
They shot each other!

66
00:06:23.876 --> 00:06:25.167
Do you think so?

67
00:06:26.542 --> 00:06:28.250
(rain sounds outside)

68
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.626
Excuse me... excuse me. Miss Parker?

69
00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:48.042
You're Bunny Parker. aren't
you? The famous sharpshooter?

70
00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:52.125
I was there the day you shot
that outlaw: Vincent de Molay.

71
00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:53.751
Vinny de Mole.

72
00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:57.918
That's the one. You're a
legend! A household name!

73
00:06:59.042 --> 00:07:00.042
Is that all?

74
00:07:00.876 --> 00:07:05.209
Oh. no. You're much more. So much more.

75
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.876
What do you want?

76
00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:08.459
I just wanted to meet you.

77
00:07:08.584 --> 00:07:11.334
Well. you met me. Now go away.

78
00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:19.000
Something else?

79
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.167
Well. the truth is ma'am:

80
00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:25.584
Word around town is
that uh... you know...

81
00:07:26.167 --> 00:07:27.167
What?

82
00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:30.334
Well. I really don't know how to say it...

83
00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:32.083
Say what?

84
00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:34.209
Well. ma'am...

85
00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:37.834
(suggestive whispering)

86
00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:42.918
Is that right?

87
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.375
Is that what you heard I do?

88
00:07:45.792 --> 00:07:46.792
Is it true?

89
00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:48.959
Come here.

90
00:07:50.667 --> 00:07:51.709
I'll show ya.

91
00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:54.459
AUURGGHH!

92
00:07:54.584 --> 00:07:57.042
Is that what you wanted?!
Is that what you heard I do?!

93
00:07:57.792 --> 00:08:00.417
You crazy witch! I'll tell the sheriff!

94
00:08:00.626 --> 00:08:01.667
Eh. blow it out your ass!

95
00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:03.000
(bottle shatters)

96
00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:10.083
-Huh! Bunny Parker.

97
00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:12.667
Yeah. Bunny Parker...

98
00:08:13.417 --> 00:08:16.709
I was there the day she shot
Vinny de Mole and saved the town...

99
00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:18.209
...changed my life.

100
00:08:18.542 --> 00:08:21.209
I hear she's living over in Kirskey now.

101
00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:22.584
Kirksey?

102
00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:26.083
I'd love to go and thank her.

103
00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:27.918
-Thank her? For what?

104
00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:31.042
For inspiring me and
many other girls like me.

105
00:08:31.042 --> 00:08:32.751
She's a great role model.

106
00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:34.209
A role model?

107
00:08:34.542 --> 00:08:35.584
(laughs)

108
00:08:35.626 --> 00:08:37.000
-What's so funny?

109
00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:39.167
She's a drunk now.

110
00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:41.042
I'm being serious.

111
00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:42.751
I am too. She's a drunk.

112
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:48.083
Now. Miss Crawford. you wanted to see me?

113
00:08:48.083 --> 00:08:50.083
I believe it's about Little Jimmy?

114
00:08:50.083 --> 00:08:56.167
-Yes. I don't know how to put this but he's
been having a little difficulty in class.

115
00:08:56.459 --> 00:09:01.626
I'll tell you what Miss Crawford: Jimmy
was never the sharpest tool in the shed.

116
00:09:01.626 --> 00:09:05.792
But. he's going to be a rancher
- he doesn't need to be a genius.

117
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.167
Now. is there anything
else? I'm a busy man.

118
00:09:09.459 --> 00:09:12.417
Well. actually. yes if
you have a moment. sir.

119
00:09:13.417 --> 00:09:16.042
His behavior has been a little unruly.

120
00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:17.959
Unruly. well... (laughs)

121
00:09:18.918 --> 00:09:20.042
I'm afraid so.

122
00:09:21.959 --> 00:09:27.250
Well. my mama always told me.
"Spare the rod and spoil the child."

123
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.876
She'd say it as she was whacking me.

124
00:09:29.876 --> 00:09:33.375
So. what you should do Miss
Crawford is use your switch

125
00:09:33.417 --> 00:09:36.626
or whatever you have
whenever he gets out of line.

126
00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.459
-Hello Doris!
(door closes)

127
00:09:49.042 --> 00:09:51.042
-You'll never guess where I was.

128
00:09:51.042 --> 00:09:57.500
I was down at the schoolhouse - teacher
wanted to talk to me about Little Jimmy.

129
00:09:58.417 --> 00:10:03.709
I told her. "Miss Crawford. you
expect me to do your job AND mine?"

130
00:10:04.083 --> 00:10:09.250
How can I do that? How can I split
myself in two and be at the school

131
00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:11.834
taking care of Jimmy and be here?

132
00:10:12.626 --> 00:10:14.292
Truth of the matter is...

133
00:10:15.083 --> 00:10:17.083
Doris. I'd rather be with you.

134
00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:20.709
I love watching you.
Making sure you're comfy.

135
00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:25.834
Making sure you're nice and warm in there.

136
00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:29.167
Look at this:

137
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.083
"Doris Yates."

138
00:10:32.584 --> 00:10:34.250
Bank robbery. arson...

139
00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:37.751
Public nudity...

140
00:10:40.709 --> 00:10:41.709
and mopery.

141
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.876
I had to look that up!
You know what mopery is?

142
00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:51.500
It's exposing yourself to a blind person!

143
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.500
Weeeyooo!

144
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.500
That's nuts!

145
00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:58.542
You are something else. Doris.

146
00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:03.626
I'd like to see if you were still so
brave if these bars weren't between us.

147
00:11:03.626 --> 00:11:05.209
Oh. I think I would.

148
00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:09.834
I think if we tangled.
Doris. I'd come out on top.

149
00:11:10.876 --> 00:11:14.209
So what's a girl gotta do to
get some water around here?

150
00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:17.334
Oh. I understand. You're thirsty?

151
00:11:18.209 --> 00:11:19.834
Water would be nice.

152
00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:22.083
I'd give you some but...

153
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
We all out.

154
00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:31.876
(thunder and light rain)

155
00:11:43.584 --> 00:11:44.792
(door creaking)

156
00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:01.042
Make one more move
and it will be your last.

157
00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:02.042
Drop it!

158
00:12:04.834 --> 00:12:05.834
(thunder)

159
00:12:13.542 --> 00:12:15.209
Hands behind your head.

160
00:12:18.292 --> 00:12:20.959
Would you have any interest
in an arrangement that...

161
00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:23.584
Not on your life! Go. Move.

162
00:12:27.626 --> 00:12:29.417
-Stand where I can see you.

163
00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:36.042
Now: Take off your clothes.

164
00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:38.125
What?

165
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:43.792
Did I studder? Take off your clothes.

166
00:12:57.918 --> 00:12:59.959
Do you even know how
to use one of those things?

167
00:13:00.083 --> 00:13:01.751
-Shut up!

168
00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:14.626
Now...

169
00:13:17.876 --> 00:13:20.584
I'm going to...

170
00:13:20.959 --> 00:13:21.959
(gasp)

171
00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:25.083
(gun clicks)

172
00:13:25.375 --> 00:13:27.083
It's not even loaded.

173
00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:32.209
You know. one of these days you're gunna
have to use one of these things!

174
00:13:32.209 --> 00:13:34.375
I'm a teacher. not a gunslinger!

175
00:13:37.876 --> 00:13:38.918
(loud voices)

176
00:13:39.584 --> 00:13:41.834
-Settle down. ladies! Settle down!

177
00:13:42.626 --> 00:13:43.959
Hey! Settle down!

178
00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:48.542
Profits are way down this year

179
00:13:48.709 --> 00:13:51.542
and we need a gimmick to
start bringing people back in.

180
00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:54.626
I'm open to suggestions...
anybody have anything?

181
00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:57.334
What about a horse-wash?

182
00:13:58.292 --> 00:13:59.959
That sounds complicated.

183
00:14:01.626 --> 00:14:04.417
What if we came to work
dressed like animals?

184
00:14:04.417 --> 00:14:07.167
Sascha here can dress like a porcupine...

185
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.584
I don't think anyone finds porcupines sexy!

186
00:14:10.584 --> 00:14:12.751
That's just you: You're a furry!

187
00:14:16.083 --> 00:14:18.751
We could sell tickets to my sword trick!

188
00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:22.542
Are you being intentionally slow?

189
00:14:24.459 --> 00:14:25.876
Men like biscuits.

190
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.459
I make biscuit.

191
00:14:32.876 --> 00:14:36.959
What kinda biscuit? Because
that could be multiple things.

192
00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.542
What about these?

193
00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:40.000
What the hell are these?

194
00:14:40.292 --> 00:14:44.000
I don't know. I found this
bag on the floor the other day.

195
00:14:44.626 --> 00:14:47.626
Maybe it will be a good
way to bring people in.

196
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Huh!

197
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:54.751
Hmm...

198
00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.375
(Jailer snoring)

199
00:15:00.792 --> 00:15:02.209
(rain and thunder)

200
00:15:03.709 --> 00:15:05.209
(snoring continues)

201
00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:20.709
(tense music)

202
00:15:30.459 --> 00:15:31.459
(snoring)

203
00:15:38.876 --> 00:15:40.500
(huge crash outside)

204
00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.250
The hell?

205
00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:45.709
-What the hell are you doing?

206
00:15:46.334 --> 00:15:47.834
What time's dinner?

207
00:15:48.459 --> 00:15:49.709
When I'm hungry!

208
00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:52.500
-I'll let you know.

209
00:15:53.042 --> 00:15:54.709
-Did you hear that noise?

210
00:15:57.542 --> 00:15:59.209
Hello?

211
00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:01.959
Anybody out here?

212
00:16:04.042 --> 00:16:05.042
-Hello?

213
00:16:07.292 --> 00:16:10.250
(rain and wind)

214
00:16:13.542 --> 00:16:15.459
(tense music)

215
00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:29.125
(keys jangle)

216
00:16:31.834 --> 00:16:33.500
(loud thump on the roof)

217
00:16:34.876 --> 00:16:35.876
What was that?

218
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.959
Probably just a tree branch or something.

219
00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.167
Don't be so jumpy.

220
00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:50.167
(another thump on the roof)

221
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.626
There it is again.

222
00:16:51.626 --> 00:16:53.250
C'mon. it's nothing!

223
00:16:54.417 --> 00:16:55.792
Go back to sleep.

224
00:17:00.167 --> 00:17:01.459
(enormous crash)

225
00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:05.542
(multiple loud thumps on the roof)

226
00:17:06.751 --> 00:17:09.626
(thumps grow louder)

227
00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:12.667
(Pterodactyl screeches)

228
00:17:13.542 --> 00:17:16.125
(heavy rain and thunder)

229
00:17:20.292 --> 00:17:23.292
(pterodactyl screech)

230
00:17:30.959 --> 00:17:32.083
(loud thunder)

231
00:17:43.417 --> 00:17:45.542
(loud screech)

232
00:17:49.709 --> 00:17:50.709
(thunder)

233
00:17:56.584 --> 00:17:59.918
(pterodactyl growls)

234
00:18:09.918 --> 00:18:12.959
(pterodactyl growling)

235
00:18:17.459 --> 00:18:19.167
(pterodactyl screeches)

236
00:18:19.626 --> 00:18:21.083
(shattering glass)

237
00:18:22.042 --> 00:18:24.125
(fire crackling)

238
00:18:26.083 --> 00:18:28.083
(coughing)

239
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.167
(pterodactyl screeches)

240
00:18:38.292 --> 00:18:39.876
(coughing continues)

241
00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:49.125
(coughing)

242
00:18:50.667 --> 00:18:52.334
(pterodactyl screams)

243
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.209
(fire crackles)

244
00:19:02.542 --> 00:19:04.918
NARRATOR: With an
outlaw now on the loose...

245
00:19:04.918 --> 00:19:09.375
Sheriff Steven Winslow had
no time to listen to complaints

246
00:19:09.375 --> 00:19:10.876
of flying monsters.

247
00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:14.000
When asked what he thought of these reports

248
00:19:14.584 --> 00:19:21.584
He went on record as saying. "The
only thing I'm interested in is proof."

249
00:19:22.042 --> 00:19:27.959
"Hard proof that these things are not
the result of overactive imaginations."

250
00:19:30.292 --> 00:19:35.459
Unbeknownst to the sheriff
and the citizens of Kirksey

251
00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:38.792
The proof lay hidden

252
00:19:39.042 --> 00:19:44.209
in the desk of Deborah
Dukes Riley Masterson III.

253
00:19:58.584 --> 00:19:59.626
(door closes)

254
00:20:02.709 --> 00:20:05.375
Isn't it a little bit late
to be making breakfast?

255
00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:06.709
What the hell are you doing here?

256
00:20:06.709 --> 00:20:09.626
That's one helluva egg.
Where'd you get that?

257
00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:10.709
None of your business.

258
00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:13.542
Oh. Debbie. Debbie. Debbie.

259
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.709
-Oh. Jesus Christ.

260
00:20:17.417 --> 00:20:21.584
Look at you: drinking half a dozen
bottles before noon. That's disappointing.

261
00:20:21.584 --> 00:20:23.667
Why? You think I could do more?

262
00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:26.459
I bet you I could

263
00:20:30.042 --> 00:20:31.042
Bunny?

264
00:20:31.459 --> 00:20:32.959
What's the problem?

265
00:20:34.626 --> 00:20:37.667
C'mon Bunny you can tell
me: What's the problem?

266
00:20:38.417 --> 00:20:40.792
I'm gunna make it
crystal clear for you:

267
00:20:41.834 --> 00:20:42.834
I'm broke.

268
00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:44.167
I am so broke.

269
00:20:44.918 --> 00:20:48.792
Well. maybe if you
cleaned yourself up a bit...

270
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.751
-Quit the drinking...

271
00:20:50.751 --> 00:20:52.334
No! No. no no no no!

272
00:20:52.792 --> 00:20:55.042
Look: Can't I come work for you?

273
00:20:55.042 --> 00:20:56.083
Psh! Like Hell!

274
00:20:56.083 --> 00:20:57.292
What? Why not?

275
00:20:57.375 --> 00:20:58.876
"Why not?" Look at you!

276
00:20:58.876 --> 00:21:01.792
Yeah! Look at me! I could do it.

277
00:21:01.792 --> 00:21:03.834
You? A whore?

278
00:21:03.834 --> 00:21:06.250
Your father would turn in his grave!

279
00:21:06.584 --> 00:21:08.125
My father is alive!

280
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.584
This'll kill him!

281
00:21:10.125 --> 00:21:13.000
Just gimme one week; that's all I'm asking.

282
00:21:14.918 --> 00:21:16.584
I'll give you a night.

283
00:21:16.626 --> 00:21:17.626
Fine.

284
00:21:17.792 --> 00:21:18.792
Fine!

285
00:21:18.792 --> 00:21:19.792
Fine!

286
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.125
Lemme tell you something. Bunny Parker

287
00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:24.042
It's not as easy as it looks!

288
00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:27.667
Men don't just waltz in here from
Laredo looking for your loving!

289
00:21:27.667 --> 00:21:28.667
(door opens)

290
00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:30.834
Hey hey!

291
00:21:31.584 --> 00:21:33.250
(mischievous laughter)

292
00:21:36.292 --> 00:21:37.959
Well. look who it is...

293
00:21:38.209 --> 00:21:41.125
I just dropped by from Laredo
to have me a good time...

294
00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:42.918
Today must be my lucky day.

295
00:21:43.334 --> 00:21:45.125
It SURE is.

296
00:21:45.334 --> 00:21:46.459
Oh. c'mon now!

297
00:21:46.876 --> 00:21:50.709
We don't put our goods on
display unless they're for sale...

298
00:21:50.834 --> 00:21:52.334
Let's go upstairs.

299
00:21:52.709 --> 00:21:54.250
Gimme some of that.

300
00:22:00.792 --> 00:22:02.375
I have a better idea.

301
00:22:02.375 --> 00:22:03.626
I'm sure you do.

302
00:22:03.626 --> 00:22:04.751
-Come with me!

303
00:22:06.751 --> 00:22:07.751
(splat)

304
00:22:08.709 --> 00:22:12.083
That hard-nosed sheriff
wants proof? I'll give him proof.

305
00:22:12.083 --> 00:22:14.083
Hun. that's my birthday roast!

306
00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:17.500
Yeah. you really deserve a birthday
roast after the way you helped me today.

307
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.542
C'mon. Becca. I told the truth!

308
00:22:19.542 --> 00:22:21.959
You honestly don't
remember seeing that thing?

309
00:22:22.042 --> 00:22:23.167
I hardly remember anything!

310
00:22:23.459 --> 00:22:25.167
What DO you remember?

311
00:22:25.459 --> 00:22:26.500
I remember...

312
00:22:27.834 --> 00:22:28.876
...The Alamo?

313
00:22:29.834 --> 00:22:31.459
(exhausted laughter)

314
00:22:33.334 --> 00:22:35.042
(suspenseful music rises)

315
00:22:37.542 --> 00:22:38.542
(splat)

316
00:22:43.542 --> 00:22:45.125
(fireplace crackles)

317
00:22:46.417 --> 00:22:48.083
(sounds of scribbling)

318
00:22:54.292 --> 00:22:58.000
(strange ethereal sounds from satchel)

319
00:23:05.959 --> 00:23:07.667
(strange sounds continue)

320
00:23:21.083 --> 00:23:22.751
(tree branches rustling)

321
00:23:23.959 --> 00:23:26.042
(dinosaur roar in the distance)

322
00:23:27.751 --> 00:23:28.751
(wind blows)

323
00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:38.876
(heavy desert wind)

324
00:23:40.959 --> 00:23:42.959
(pterodactyl roar in distance)

325
00:23:45.584 --> 00:23:46.876
(wings flapping)

326
00:23:52.626 --> 00:23:53.626
(wind blows)

327
00:23:56.584 --> 00:23:57.959
(leaves rustling)

328
00:24:01.417 --> 00:24:03.083
(pterodactyl approaches)

329
00:24:06.918 --> 00:24:08.167
(wings flapping)

330
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.500
(roar)

331
00:24:19.292 --> 00:24:20.292
(roar)

332
00:24:25.167 --> 00:24:26.834
(pterodactyl chewing)

333
00:24:32.459 --> 00:24:33.959
(chewing continues)

334
00:24:36.709 --> 00:24:38.334
No. Robert. don't...

335
00:24:38.709 --> 00:24:39.709
Robert!

336
00:24:39.959 --> 00:24:40.959
(gunshot)

337
00:24:42.083 --> 00:24:43.667
(pterodactyl growls)

338
00:24:44.584 --> 00:24:45.584
(ROAR!)

339
00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:48.334
Get inside now... NOW!

340
00:24:52.334 --> 00:24:53.334
(ROAR!)

341
00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:57.125
(ROAR!)

342
00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:02.083
Hrmmphhh!

343
00:25:04.542 --> 00:25:05.542
(ROAR!)

344
00:25:08.042 --> 00:25:09.042
Hrrmpphhh!

345
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.375
Becca! Becca!!

346
00:25:13.125 --> 00:25:14.125
(ROAR!)

347
00:25:17.542 --> 00:25:18.542
Becca!!!

348
00:25:18.959 --> 00:25:19.959
(ROAR!)

349
00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:24.417
Noooooo!

350
00:25:27.667 --> 00:25:29.959
(ROAR!)

351
00:25:32.626 --> 00:25:35.751
SHERIFF: "Well. that is
quite the story. ma'am...

352
00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:38.500
...but you don't have any proof I see.

353
00:25:38.959 --> 00:25:41.626
Proof?! It took my husband!

354
00:25:41.626 --> 00:25:46.626
Yeah. well. more than likely he walked
out on you in the middle of the night...

355
00:25:46.876 --> 00:25:49.834
That's a load of horse
manure and you know it.

356
00:25:51.542 --> 00:25:53.417
I wish I did. Miss Crawford.

357
00:25:54.459 --> 00:25:55.751
Good day to you.

358
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.834
Sheriff. time is of the
essence. We have to act now!

359
00:25:59.959 --> 00:26:01.667
What is this WE stuff?

360
00:26:02.459 --> 00:26:03.459
Look...

361
00:26:03.709 --> 00:26:06.834
If you want to find it so badly...

362
00:26:07.542 --> 00:26:09.709
Why don't you form the possee?

363
00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:10.959
Me?!

364
00:26:10.959 --> 00:26:12.792
Yes. you!

365
00:26:13.792 --> 00:26:17.542
If you want to save
that boyfriend of yours...

366
00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:21.292
You're gunna have to do it by yourself.

367
00:26:22.918 --> 00:26:23.918
No...

368
00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:27.042
Not by myself.

369
00:26:35.918 --> 00:26:37.667
(birds and rooster sounds)

370
00:26:55.918 --> 00:26:57.417
(multiple gunshots)

371
00:26:57.834 --> 00:26:59.834
What the hell's got into
you. you crazy witch?

372
00:26:59.834 --> 00:27:01.500
-You get off my property!

373
00:27:01.751 --> 00:27:04.042
The woman is supposed
to make her man breakfast!

374
00:27:04.042 --> 00:27:05.792
I'll make breakfast outta you!

375
00:27:05.792 --> 00:27:07.459
Just who the hell do you think you are?

376
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:09.626
I'm Bunny Goddamn Parker - that's who I am!

377
00:27:09.626 --> 00:27:10.626
Who are you??

378
00:27:10.626 --> 00:27:12.042
Are you still drunk? I'm George...

379
00:27:12.042 --> 00:27:13.042
(GUNSHOT)

380
00:27:13.083 --> 00:27:16.584
You open your mouth again and I'll
shoot your crotch. Goerge Jameson.

381
00:27:16.584 --> 00:27:18.500
That's my least vulnerable spot!

382
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.959
I'll certainly have difficulty
with so small a target.

383
00:27:24.083 --> 00:27:25.375
You'll be sorry!

384
00:27:26.334 --> 00:27:27.334
-Yeah. yeah!

385
00:27:31.626 --> 00:27:32.626
Roaggghh!

386
00:27:38.209 --> 00:27:39.459
(birds chirping)

387
00:27:52.209 --> 00:27:53.250
Good morning!

388
00:27:53.834 --> 00:27:56.500
Who are you? Why are you behind my tree?

389
00:27:58.876 --> 00:28:02.083
I'm Rebecca Crawford. ma'am.

390
00:28:06.459 --> 00:28:09.209
I was there the day you...

391
00:28:09.626 --> 00:28:11.167
Shot Vinny de Mole!

392
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.250
Yes!

393
00:28:12.542 --> 00:28:15.542
And you were so inspired by
my larger-than-life enterprises

394
00:28:15.542 --> 00:28:18.125
that you just had to come and
see me in the flesh. is that it?

395
00:28:18.125 --> 00:28:19.125
Well. I...

396
00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.250
Maybe...

397
00:28:22.918 --> 00:28:25.375
I'm human just like you...

398
00:28:25.626 --> 00:28:29.542
and I can do anything that any other
human can do. Is that such a shock?

399
00:28:29.542 --> 00:28:31.584
No. you're so much more than that.

400
00:28:31.584 --> 00:28:32.792
You're my hero!

401
00:28:34.542 --> 00:28:35.667
(rooster call)

402
00:28:41.918 --> 00:28:43.292
What do you want?

403
00:28:43.292 --> 00:28:47.125
I actually wanna hire
you for an assignment.

404
00:28:47.417 --> 00:28:49.292
I am not a manhunter anymore.

405
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.500
Those days are over.

406
00:28:52.667 --> 00:28:54.584
What about a dinosaur hunter?

407
00:28:55.959 --> 00:28:58.292
(inspiring music)

408
00:29:02.417 --> 00:29:04.083
(desert wind blowing)

409
00:29:07.626 --> 00:29:09.125
(suspenseful music)

410
00:29:13.459 --> 00:29:15.125
(pterodactyl chewing)

411
00:29:23.417 --> 00:29:24.959
(chewing continues)

412
00:29:32.334 --> 00:29:33.334
(wind blows)

413
00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:38.626
(tense music rises)

414
00:29:45.292 --> 00:29:46.292
(whip crack)

415
00:29:46.792 --> 00:29:47.792
(ROAR!)

416
00:29:52.167 --> 00:29:53.167
(ROAR!)

417
00:29:54.334 --> 00:29:55.542
(intense music)

418
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
(ROAR!)

419
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.250
(sounds of flapping wings)

420
00:30:15.584 --> 00:30:16.918
(music of defeat)

421
00:30:19.167 --> 00:30:22.083
REBECCA: It flew south
out towards the canyons

422
00:30:22.292 --> 00:30:24.083
I think it has a nest there.

423
00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:26.667
And you want me to avenge the
death of your beloved. is that it?

424
00:30:27.083 --> 00:30:30.042
No. he's still alive. I just
want you to bring him back.

425
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.751
Well. that is quite the challenge.

426
00:30:33.167 --> 00:30:34.751
I've seen you shoot.

427
00:30:34.918 --> 00:30:37.167
This should be easy
compared to Vinny de Mole.

428
00:30:37.167 --> 00:30:38.834
Easy? You call this easy?

429
00:30:38.834 --> 00:30:39.918
Yeah!

430
00:30:40.167 --> 00:30:44.167
Vinny de Mole was a midget with an itchy
trigger finger. This is entirely different!

431
00:30:44.167 --> 00:30:45.876
Not for Bunny Parker!

432
00:30:48.876 --> 00:30:51.459
Look. I know you've been
having some trouble lately...

433
00:30:51.459 --> 00:30:54.626
but maybe this is the
job to put you back on top!

434
00:30:55.209 --> 00:30:57.334
Why should this drunken has-been help you?

435
00:30:57.334 --> 00:31:00.709
Because this drunken
has-been happens to be my hero.

436
00:31:00.709 --> 00:31:03.167
And this hero deserves to ride again.

437
00:31:10.417 --> 00:31:11.834
(mysterious music)

438
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.667
(weird egg noises)

439
00:31:19.042 --> 00:31:20.375
Are these them?

440
00:31:20.959 --> 00:31:21.959
Sure are.

441
00:31:22.626 --> 00:31:23.959
Pterodactyl eggs.

442
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.083
Now. what the hell is a... ptero...

443
00:31:26.334 --> 00:31:27.542
Ptero...dactyl?

444
00:31:28.417 --> 00:31:32.125
Half bird... half
snake... and all devil.

445
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.334
We'd like to return the eggs to
its mama and rescue my husband.

446
00:31:37.042 --> 00:31:38.167
You're joking.

447
00:31:38.792 --> 00:31:43.459
The only reason why she's attacking
is because her eggs have been stolen.

448
00:31:43.626 --> 00:31:46.834
So. you're going to waltz
into this bird's house...

449
00:31:46.834 --> 00:31:51.751
...and you're going to ask it nicely to
trade your husband for some of its eggs?

450
00:31:51.751 --> 00:31:53.417
In a nutshell... yes.

451
00:31:54.584 --> 00:31:56.250
(laughing in disbelief)

452
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:01.792
If you're doing this. I want in.

453
00:32:01.792 --> 00:32:02.792
Really?

454
00:32:03.292 --> 00:32:05.500
You'd stick your neck out for me?

455
00:32:06.667 --> 00:32:07.667
No!

456
00:32:08.834 --> 00:32:10.542
I don't even know you!

457
00:32:11.334 --> 00:32:14.083
No. if this is as big as you say it is...

458
00:32:14.375 --> 00:32:16.959
I wanna stuff it and put it in my parlor.

459
00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:18.459
You're gunna stuff it?

460
00:32:18.459 --> 00:32:20.292
Wouldn't that be something?

461
00:32:21.125 --> 00:32:22.125
And...

462
00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:24.375
If you let me come with you...

463
00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:28.876
I'll give you access to
The Best Chest in the West.

464
00:32:29.584 --> 00:32:31.667
DEBBIE: The Best Chest in the West.

465
00:32:31.667 --> 00:32:34.542
I was expecting
something entirely different.

466
00:32:34.876 --> 00:32:36.751
Where did you get all these?

467
00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:41.209
-When our boys can't pay in cash. we get
'em to pay with something just as valuable.

468
00:32:41.209 --> 00:32:42.876
-Well. they're very nice.

469
00:32:43.417 --> 00:32:44.584
Whaddya say. ladies?

470
00:32:44.584 --> 00:32:49.334
Can this beautiful. young businesswoman
accompany y'all on your adventure?

471
00:32:49.959 --> 00:32:51.000
(music rises)

472
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.500
(gunshot)

473
00:33:12.042 --> 00:33:13.375
(adventure music)

474
00:33:18.459 --> 00:33:21.542
REBECCA: Every journey
starts with a first step.

475
00:33:21.542 --> 00:33:23.459
May the Good Lord be with us.

476
00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:24.667
Onward!

477
00:33:25.584 --> 00:33:26.584
Wait.

478
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:27.751
What is it?

479
00:33:28.334 --> 00:33:29.459
We're walking?

480
00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:31.209
Is that a problem?

481
00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:33.250
We don't have any horses?

482
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.167
Do you see any horses?

483
00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:38.250
Oh. no. no. no - this will NOT do.

484
00:33:38.918 --> 00:33:40.667
Well. what do you suggest?

485
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.626
(night crickets)

486
00:33:49.542 --> 00:33:51.584
(snoring)

487
00:33:55.417 --> 00:33:56.959
(offscreen horse sounds)

488
00:33:58.292 --> 00:34:00.751
This is awful! I feel awful!

489
00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:03.292
You'll feel worse after a day of walking...

490
00:34:03.292 --> 00:34:05.334
These horses will get
us there in half the time.

491
00:34:05.334 --> 00:34:07.334
Bunny. you're supposed
to be the voice of reason...

492
00:34:07.417 --> 00:34:08.792
Please tell me this is a bad idea.

493
00:34:08.792 --> 00:34:10.083
This is a bad idea.

494
00:34:10.083 --> 00:34:11.083
See?!

495
00:34:11.125 --> 00:34:14.125
Wait. do you mean that? Or
are you just repeating what I said?

496
00:34:18.083 --> 00:34:19.125
(tense music)

497
00:34:27.334 --> 00:34:30.125
Dammit! I thought he
kept this thing unlocked.

498
00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:31.250
That tears it!

499
00:34:37.959 --> 00:34:39.167
No. it doesn't.

500
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.417
(frisky music begins)

501
00:34:45.876 --> 00:34:48.334
Debbie! What the hell are you doing?!

502
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.250
(snoring)

503
00:35:00.167 --> 00:35:02.667
(music begins to rise)

504
00:35:08.667 --> 00:35:09.667
What?!

505
00:35:10.667 --> 00:35:11.876
Who the hell are you?!

506
00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:12.959
I can explain!

507
00:35:13.375 --> 00:35:15.042
You better do so quick!

508
00:35:15.125 --> 00:35:18.209
You wouldn't harm a beautiful
young woman and her two friends...

509
00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:19.751
Two friends!?

510
00:35:19.792 --> 00:35:24.417
Especially since all we wanted to
do was buy some of your fine horses!

511
00:35:25.751 --> 00:35:26.792
You got cash?

512
00:35:27.417 --> 00:35:28.876
Not exactly... no.

513
00:35:29.667 --> 00:35:30.667
(cocks rifle)

514
00:35:30.667 --> 00:35:31.667
BUT!

515
00:35:32.751 --> 00:35:33.751
But...

516
00:35:34.542 --> 00:35:38.500
I'm sure we can find an
alternate form of payment...

517
00:35:39.042 --> 00:35:40.751
can't we. Mr. Wilkinson?

518
00:35:42.959 --> 00:35:46.375
How much did you say those
horses were worth exactly?

519
00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:49.375
(horse neighs)

520
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.292
(keys jangle)

521
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:01.959
Step lively. girls!

522
00:36:01.959 --> 00:36:03.542
We're burning moonlight!

523
00:36:04.083 --> 00:36:05.334
(adventure theme begins)

524
00:36:12.918 --> 00:36:15.375
(horses galloping)

525
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.500
Yay! Horses!

526
00:36:45.918 --> 00:36:49.250
-Wait. wait. wait! Hold your
horses I dropped my hat!

527
00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:00.542
Okay. now let's go.

528
00:37:23.042 --> 00:37:27.792
Alright. it's your first lesson
as a shooter. schoolteacher.

529
00:37:28.959 --> 00:37:31.542
First. take note of your surroundings.

530
00:37:32.417 --> 00:37:37.334
When the sun casts long shadows. a
man will seem much further than he appears.

531
00:37:39.417 --> 00:37:43.792
At noon the sun will be directly
overhead and a man will seem much closer.

532
00:37:44.709 --> 00:37:46.417
How close is too close?

533
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.834
You'll see too much of him.

534
00:37:50.751 --> 00:37:51.751
You'll see how he sweats.

535
00:37:53.042 --> 00:37:54.709
You'll see how he blinks.

536
00:37:55.751 --> 00:37:58.459
And when you take time to see all that...

537
00:37:58.751 --> 00:37:59.876
He'll kill you.

538
00:37:59.876 --> 00:38:00.876
(gunshot)

539
00:38:01.667 --> 00:38:03.542
See everything and see nothing.

540
00:38:04.083 --> 00:38:05.083
Alright.

541
00:38:05.375 --> 00:38:06.375
Aim the gun.

542
00:38:08.417 --> 00:38:10.667
Look down the barrel of the gun...

543
00:38:11.584 --> 00:38:13.834
...and gently squeeze the trigger.

544
00:38:16.834 --> 00:38:19.167
(sneeze)
(GUNSHOT!)

545
00:38:21.959 --> 00:38:24.709
Well. I guess we'll be
leaving the shooting to Bunny.

546
00:38:24.709 --> 00:38:27.000
No. give her a chance!

547
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.792
Well. I'm moving. I don't
want to be hit by friendly fire.

548
00:38:31.626 --> 00:38:34.375
You know. maybe I'd
be better off with a rifle.

549
00:38:34.375 --> 00:38:35.667
Woah. woah. woah!

550
00:38:35.667 --> 00:38:36.667
What??

551
00:38:36.876 --> 00:38:38.375
You see this rifle?

552
00:38:39.959 --> 00:38:40.959
See it.

553
00:38:42.083 --> 00:38:43.083
Smell it.

554
00:38:44.292 --> 00:38:45.292
Touch it.

555
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:47.250
Kiss it.

556
00:38:47.751 --> 00:38:48.751
Kiss it!

557
00:38:51.292 --> 00:38:53.083
This here rifle is Dave.

558
00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:54.500
You can see him...

559
00:38:55.167 --> 00:38:56.167
You can smell him...

560
00:38:56.209 --> 00:38:57.209
You can kiss him...

561
00:38:57.292 --> 00:39:00.918
But no one. and I mean no one.
shoots Dave except for Bunny Parker.

562
00:39:01.167 --> 00:39:02.542
Whatever you say.

563
00:39:03.584 --> 00:39:05.250
(desert wind howling)

564
00:39:52.167 --> 00:39:53.876
(wind continues to howl)

565
00:40:25.083 --> 00:40:26.626
(campfire crackles)

566
00:40:39.375 --> 00:40:41.751
You really are devoted
to that husband of yours.

567
00:40:41.751 --> 00:40:43.167
He's all I've got.

568
00:40:43.876 --> 00:40:46.667
I hate to ask this. but what if he's dead?

569
00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:47.667
He isn't.

570
00:40:47.751 --> 00:40:48.751
Yeah. but what if he is?

571
00:40:48.792 --> 00:40:49.792
He isn't.

572
00:40:49.918 --> 00:40:50.918
Yeah. but what if he is?

573
00:40:50.959 --> 00:40:51.959
He's alive and I know it!

574
00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:53.167
Yeah. yeah.

575
00:40:56.292 --> 00:40:57.292
Wait.

576
00:40:58.334 --> 00:41:00.000
Where's my green bag?

577
00:41:01.542 --> 00:41:02.709
What green bag?

578
00:41:02.709 --> 00:41:04.459
The green bag with all the food in it.

579
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.500
I could have sworn...

580
00:41:05.876 --> 00:41:09.000
Wait. you didn't set it down when
we were stealing the horses. did you?

581
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.167
No. of course not.

582
00:41:10.375 --> 00:41:14.042
NARRATOR: Let's put that
statement to the test. shall we?

583
00:41:14.709 --> 00:41:16.709
(film rewinds)

584
00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:26.834
(audience cheers and applauds)

585
00:41:31.459 --> 00:41:35.334
(Stars and Stripes Forever plays)

586
00:41:39.667 --> 00:41:40.667
Oh my God.

587
00:41:41.292 --> 00:41:44.417
The most important satchel
and she leaves it behind.

588
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.667
This isn't my fault.

589
00:41:45.667 --> 00:41:47.542
Then whose fault is it. Deborah?

590
00:41:47.584 --> 00:41:50.500
Shut up. Bunny!
I don't need you to call me Deborah!

591
00:41:50.667 --> 00:41:52.459
You packed whiskey - you didn't pack food?

592
00:41:52.459 --> 00:41:54.500
If anything. it's anything but our fault!

593
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.876
If you would've got horses for us

594
00:41:55.959 --> 00:41:57.500
we wouldn't have had to steal these!

595
00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.209
Then you wouldn't have forgotten our food

596
00:41:59.292 --> 00:42:00.459
Is that it?
-Yes!

597
00:42:01.542 --> 00:42:04.250
I figure we have three days
until we reach the canyon.

598
00:42:04.417 --> 00:42:06.334
-I'm going home.
-Like hell you are!

599
00:42:06.334 --> 00:42:09.751
What do you suggest?
We starve halfway there?

600
00:42:09.751 --> 00:42:11.250
We'll find food along the way!

601
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.042
Sure! Manna from
Heaven will fall into our laps.

602
00:42:14.042 --> 00:42:16.959
I say we go back. we
stock up. and we come back later.

603
00:42:17.042 --> 00:42:18.250
Robert might be dead by then!

604
00:42:18.459 --> 00:42:19.709
He might be dead by now. babe!

605
00:42:20.125 --> 00:42:21.125
(GUNSHOT!)

606
00:42:21.667 --> 00:42:22.667
Knock it off!

607
00:42:27.918 --> 00:42:28.918
Wait...

608
00:42:29.959 --> 00:42:31.876
What if we ate one of the eggs?

609
00:42:31.876 --> 00:42:32.876
Debbie!

610
00:42:33.125 --> 00:42:35.959
I mean. we have a bunch
of them! It won't even miss it.

611
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.834
Oh. I'm sure that'll make
the mama real happy.

612
00:42:37.959 --> 00:42:39.959
How do you know the mama
doesn't eat her own eggs?

613
00:42:39.959 --> 00:42:41.500
A mother wouldn't eat her own children!

614
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:44.334
A human mother! But
we're talking about a ptero...

615
00:42:44.334 --> 00:42:45.334
A ptero...

616
00:42:45.334 --> 00:42:46.334
A PTERODACTYL!

617
00:42:46.417 --> 00:42:48.250
A pterodactyl! Much obliged!

618
00:42:48.334 --> 00:42:49.334
Gimme that.

619
00:42:49.918 --> 00:42:51.626
No! Bunny. help me out here!

620
00:42:51.626 --> 00:42:52.959
I agree with Debbie on this one.

621
00:42:52.959 --> 00:42:53.959
What?!

622
00:42:54.542 --> 00:42:55.876
(stressful music)

623
00:42:57.125 --> 00:42:58.125
Now look at what you did!

624
00:42:58.542 --> 00:43:00.209
So help me God if you...

625
00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.626
(cracking sounds)

626
00:43:02.626 --> 00:43:03.626
What?

627
00:43:05.292 --> 00:43:06.876
(cracking continues)

628
00:43:13.876 --> 00:43:17.709
(adorable pterodactyl noises)

629
00:43:20.375 --> 00:43:21.667
Well. I'll be...

630
00:43:22.626 --> 00:43:25.250
And you wanted to eat him!

631
00:43:26.417 --> 00:43:28.334
(adorable pterodactyl noises)

632
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.542
(tense music)

633
00:43:37.584 --> 00:43:38.834
(flapping wings)

634
00:43:52.876 --> 00:43:53.876
(growling)

635
00:44:07.834 --> 00:44:08.834
(ROAR!)

636
00:44:18.375 --> 00:44:19.375
(ROAR!)

637
00:44:22.918 --> 00:44:23.918
(ROAR!)

638
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:27.792
(tense music)

639
00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:30.292
(GUNSHOT!)

640
00:44:31.125 --> 00:44:32.125
(ROAR!)

641
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:38.500
(ROAR!)

642
00:44:44.167 --> 00:44:45.167
(ROAR!)

643
00:44:47.751 --> 00:44:48.751
(GUNSHOT!)

644
00:44:52.209 --> 00:44:54.459
(adorable baby pterodactyl noises)

645
00:45:01.375 --> 00:45:03.626
When you're done playing
nurse-maid to that thing

646
00:45:03.626 --> 00:45:05.709
could you possibly
shoot us something to eat

647
00:45:05.709 --> 00:45:08.375
before I gnaw off my arm in starvation?!

648
00:45:08.459 --> 00:45:11.125
Have you seen any wildlife this morning?

649
00:45:11.292 --> 00:45:12.792
(suspenseful music)

650
00:45:14.292 --> 00:45:15.959
(silence)

651
00:45:18.209 --> 00:45:19.209
(light wind)

652
00:45:22.876 --> 00:45:25.334
Someone or something scared them off.

653
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.459
(foreboding music)

654
00:45:48.459 --> 00:45:50.167
I can't take this anymore.

655
00:45:53.042 --> 00:45:54.042
Oh my God...

656
00:45:54.417 --> 00:45:57.167
-What do you think you're doing?
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

657
00:45:57.167 --> 00:45:58.292
Don't do that!

658
00:45:58.417 --> 00:45:59.417
I'm hungry!

659
00:45:59.459 --> 00:46:01.584
Do you even know what those are?
-Berries!

660
00:46:01.667 --> 00:46:03.250
They're gunna make you sick!

661
00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.459
-Nah! I got an iron constitution!

662
00:46:06.125 --> 00:46:07.500
(chewing berries)

663
00:46:07.876 --> 00:46:10.000
You're gunna delay us like two hours!

664
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.709
Why? What's gunna happen?

665
00:46:12.876 --> 00:46:14.584
(loud wretching noises)

666
00:46:16.292 --> 00:46:21.792
I know. The stupid lady had to go eat those
poisonous berries after we told her not to

667
00:46:22.334 --> 00:46:24.000
and delay us four hours!

668
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:27.584
(irritated baby pterodactyl noises)

669
00:46:27.834 --> 00:46:30.918
Terry! No! No! Come back!
-He'll never come back!

670
00:46:31.959 --> 00:46:34.167
(curious baby pterodactyl noises)

671
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.459
No. I think he will. Here.
gimme Debbie's coat.

672
00:46:43.918 --> 00:46:45.375
Hey. Terry! Terry?

673
00:46:46.334 --> 00:46:47.334
Here Terry!

674
00:46:48.918 --> 00:46:50.375
C'mon. boy! C'mon!

675
00:46:51.918 --> 00:46:54.000
(happy baby pterodactyl noises)

676
00:46:54.918 --> 00:46:56.250
(THUNK!)

677
00:46:56.542 --> 00:46:58.209
Hey. how'd you do that?

678
00:46:58.542 --> 00:47:00.250
D'ye ever see a bullfight?

679
00:47:00.459 --> 00:47:01.459
Yeah. so?

680
00:47:01.751 --> 00:47:05.709
Y'know. the matador holds
a red cape and the bull charges?

681
00:47:06.125 --> 00:47:07.125
So?

682
00:47:07.375 --> 00:47:10.709
I think that the same
principle can be applied here.

683
00:47:11.417 --> 00:47:13.209
(Debbie coughing offscreen)

684
00:47:18.584 --> 00:47:19.584
Ladies...

685
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.417
I have come to the
very difficult decision...

686
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.209
I'm going home.

687
00:47:27.918 --> 00:47:29.459
(crickets chirping)

688
00:47:31.209 --> 00:47:34.209
You know. we're not gunna last
much longer if we don't get some food.

689
00:47:34.959 --> 00:47:36.667
Something will turn up.

690
00:47:37.042 --> 00:47:38.709
The odds are on our side.

691
00:47:39.292 --> 00:47:40.959
You really are something.

692
00:47:43.959 --> 00:47:45.292
Y'all smell that?

693
00:47:46.709 --> 00:47:48.292
Someone's cooking chicken.

694
00:47:48.292 --> 00:47:49.500
Not here. girl.

695
00:47:50.709 --> 00:47:51.959
No. I'm serious.

696
00:47:52.292 --> 00:47:54.209
Why don't you go back to bed?

697
00:47:54.542 --> 00:47:57.083
No. wait. I smell it too.

698
00:47:57.334 --> 00:47:59.000
(the girls sniff the air)

699
00:48:09.459 --> 00:48:11.626
What did I tell you? What did I tell you?!

700
00:48:13.751 --> 00:48:15.667
Get down! Are you crazy?

701
00:48:15.667 --> 00:48:19.834
No. I'm hungry! And it's
my fault we're in this mess.

702
00:48:19.834 --> 00:48:21.667
Don't worry. I'll cover you.

703
00:48:21.834 --> 00:48:26.167
Not to worry. ladies. My
methods are much simpler.

704
00:48:26.542 --> 00:48:27.667
Oh. not again.

705
00:48:28.459 --> 00:48:29.959
(campfire crackles)

706
00:48:33.459 --> 00:48:35.125
Well. hey there. boys.

707
00:48:37.876 --> 00:48:43.292
You boys wouldn't be willing to help me and
my friends get a little din-din for tonight

708
00:48:43.584 --> 00:48:44.584
Would you?

709
00:48:44.876 --> 00:48:45.876
Well...

710
00:48:46.042 --> 00:48:47.667
What's in it for us?

711
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:49.250
Well...

712
00:48:50.292 --> 00:48:51.417
(frisky music)

713
00:48:52.334 --> 00:48:55.042
She's got guts. A lot of guts.

714
00:48:55.042 --> 00:48:57.584
What's she gunna do with both of them?

715
00:48:59.042 --> 00:49:01.834
So. what do you say?

716
00:49:02.626 --> 00:49:03.709
What do I say?

717
00:49:04.834 --> 00:49:07.792
Haha! What do you think I say. Debbie?

718
00:49:11.375 --> 00:49:12.375
C'mon out. girls!

719
00:49:13.334 --> 00:49:17.167
-We thought you'd need a hand
so... we came to help you out!

720
00:49:18.542 --> 00:49:19.542
Oh.

721
00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:26.250
We tracked these winged beasts to
their cave at the bottom of that cliff.

722
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.751
-And we picked up a friend along the way.

723
00:49:30.375 --> 00:49:31.375
C'mon out. Doris!

724
00:49:33.209 --> 00:49:34.417
(intense music)

725
00:49:40.334 --> 00:49:44.500
Come to think of it. we should've
just let you think we were men.

726
00:49:44.876 --> 00:49:46.542

NARRATOR: Rebecca Crawford.

818

Schoolteacher and devoted wife.

819
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:31.626
Her friends...

820
00:55:32.083 --> 00:55:36.626
...dead from an explosive
and fatal dinosaur attack.

821
00:55:38.042 --> 00:55:44.083
Alone with nothing but a stick of
dynamite. a metal bucket and some string.

822
00:55:46.209 --> 00:55:50.292
And yet. Rebecca Crawford hatches a plan.

823
00:55:52.083 --> 00:55:53.626
A plan so remote...

824
00:55:54.626 --> 00:55:59.334
...so implausible that it
fringes upon insanity.

825
00:56:00.918 --> 00:56:03.918
But it could work.

826
00:56:05.959 --> 00:56:07.417
For her husband...

827
00:56:07.876 --> 00:56:10.209

842
00:57:58.709 --> 00:57:59.709

843
00:58:00.167 --> 00:58:01.876
Robert. wake up. please!

844
00:58:02.292 --> 00:58:03.584

845
00:58:04.417 --> 00:58:06.083
Robert. please wake up.

846
00:58:06.751 --> 00:58:08.751

848
00:58:10.792 --> 00:58:12.209

Yeah. it's me!

854
00:58:19.209 --> 00:58:21.375
Oh. thank God! Thank God!

855
00:58:22.042 --> 00:58:23.042

856
00:58:24.209 --> 00:58:25.500

857
00:58:31.209 --> 00:58:32.209

(music rises)

864
00:58:57.292 --> 00:58:59.959
This ends now.

865
00:59:01.667 --> 00:59:02.667
Becca!

866
00:59:02.876 --> 00:59:04.751

(music intensifies)

871
00:59:35.959 --> 00:59:39.500
I'm gunna distract it and when it
comes this way. you pull the string.

872
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.626
And then what?

873
00:59:41.042 --> 00:59:42.542
Terry will take care of the rest.

874
00:59:42.542 --> 00:59:44.209
Who the heck is Terry?

875
00:59:44.417 --> 00:59:46.959
What if it doesn't work?
-It will work!

876
00:59:49.626 --> 00:59:51.918
There's four bullets left but
I think the powder is damp.

877

891
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.918
Get ready. Robert.

892

01:01:05.876 --> 01:01:06.876
-Get ready.

894
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.250

And for Doris Yates and
the girls at the bordello

987

-Alright!

994
01:08:09.209 --> 01:08:11.459

-Alright. you gotta help me out here...

996
01:08:19.918 --> 01:08:20.959
...I'm blind.

997
01:08:28.042 --> 01:08:29.042
I'm done.

998
01:08:30.542 --> 01:08:32.584
(happy baby pterodactyl noises)

999
01:08:34.584 --> 01:08:38.209
Now. didn't I tell you my
sword trick would save the day?

1000
01:08:39.167 --> 01:08:40.167
Didn't I?

1001
01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:44.751
If you knew the drama this caused.

1002
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:48.334
Let's be honest. if it wasn't for
my slip-up with the dynamite...

1003
01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:51.042
Would we even be here today?
-You're absolutely right.

1004
01:08:51.042 --> 01:08:53.375
Thank you! Can we get more whiskey?

1005
01:08:54.375 --> 01:08:56.375
That's how I lost this here eye.

1006
01:08:57.250 --> 01:09:00.584
Now. I'll never look at
anything the same way again.

1007
01:09:04.292 --> 01:09:06.459
(music of success and happiness)

1008
01:09:07.167 --> 01:09:08.167
