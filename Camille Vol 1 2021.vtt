3
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.830
looks like doa

4
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.239
nobody saw shit as usual

5
00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.239
let's get this whole area searched throughly

6
00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.000
and don't let anyone touch a damn thing

7
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
we got here early before the media

8
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.500
but this is the sixth dead girl in two months

9
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.500
coincidence

10
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.436
either that or a long string of bad luck

11
00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:11.723
either way this has to stop

12
00:03:15.537 --> 00:03:17.537
everything alright Edwards?

13
00:03:17.537 --> 00:03:21.819
yeah yeah it's all good

14
00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.819
good I know this is new for you

15
00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.819
but welcome to the shit show

16
00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.404
the city is under fire

17
00:03:28.404 --> 00:03:30.404
everyone wants to be on top

18
00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:32.404
you life can be taken away

19
00:03:32.404 --> 00:03:35.048
on a random day just sitting on your porch

20
00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:41.506
you sure you okay?

21
00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:43.506
yeah

22
00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:47.506
just reminds me of someone I know

23
00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:49.506
it's fucked up you know

24
00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:51.506
girls are around my age

25
00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:53.267
I always wondered what would

26
00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:55.506
happen if I ever took the wrong turn

27
00:03:55.506 --> 00:03:59.500
yup it is fucked up

28
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.739
we got a black female

29
00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:03.978
early 20s doa

30
00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:05.978
seems to be an act of foul play

31
00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:08.622
appears to battered with

32
00:04:08.622 --> 00:04:12.085
lacerations on her neck and buttocks

33
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:15.899
what kind of freaky shit was she into

34
00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:17.957
dancer

35
00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:20.426
robbed

36
00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:23.011
nah

37
00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.217
looks like distribution

38
00:04:25.217 --> 00:04:29.236
apparently she wasn't too good at it

39
00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:31.880
is that blood coming out of her mouth?

40
00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:35.353
interesting

41
00:04:35.353 --> 00:04:38.231
she maybe one of Delilah's Khan

42
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.640
I'm starting to think she's the one

43
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.231
doing this shit

44
00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:43.646
there's no way she's not

45
00:04:43.646 --> 00:04:45.002
that's a bet

46
00:04:45.002 --> 00:04:47.412
this is starting to look like more and more

47
00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:50.000
I wasn't on my best behaved sort of retaliation

48
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.702
we've got to shut them down Carter

49
00:04:52.702 --> 00:04:54.142
they dealing drugs

50
00:04:54.142 --> 00:04:55.112
damage

51
00:04:55.112 --> 00:04:57.814
and destroying women

52
00:04:57.814 --> 00:04:59.814
the city doesn't bat an eye

53
00:04:59.814 --> 00:05:01.814
but when homicide is involved

54
00:05:01.814 --> 00:05:03.814
it becomes our problem

55
00:05:03.814 --> 00:05:05.814
I hear you young solider

56
00:05:05.814 --> 00:05:07.229
but remember this

57
00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.814
change doesn't happen overnight

58
00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:11.814
neither does justice

59
00:05:11.814 --> 00:05:13.814
don't worry young sister

60
00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:16.165
their day will come

61
00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:20.300
sooner rather than later

62
00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:28.279
life

63
00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.279
family

64
00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.279
friends

65
00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:34.279
love

66
00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.279
art

67
00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.279
beauty

68
00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:40.279
these are all the thing that

69
00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.635
describe America

70
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.619
you know but it's going to be okay

71
00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:13.209
cause I'm going to fix it

72
00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:15.560
I'm going to uplift our black people

73
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.209
this is a new day and age

74
00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:18.565
black and brown people

75
00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:21.735
it's time to take back what's ours

76
00:06:21.735 --> 00:06:24.710
to destroy and rebuild

77
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.549
that's the mission

78
00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:29.549
we must put down the pride

79
00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:31.549
and pick up our heads

80
00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:33.549
ask yourself people

81
00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:35.491
how long we going to go around

82
00:06:35.491 --> 00:06:38.135
asking for handouts favors

83
00:06:38.135 --> 00:06:40.310
we're trying to dethrone the opressor

84
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.434
you know what I mean?

85
00:06:43.716 --> 00:06:45.716
it's time for us to break the cycle

86
00:06:47.296 --> 00:06:49.296
the so called crabs in a bucket

87
00:06:49.296 --> 00:06:50.945
mentality has to stop

88
00:06:50.945 --> 00:06:52.945
cause we are no longer crabs

89
00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.360
and I'm Shane Sanders and I'm

90
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.424

00:10:23.212 --> 00:10:25.680
who was Charley dealing with?

183
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.680

184
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.000
I say one of them low bottom dudes from the uptown

185
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.990
or maybe she was at the wrong place at the wrong time

186
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.394

187
00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:39.394

188
00:10:39.394 --> 00:10:40.565

00:10:40.565 --> 00:10:41.394

190
00:10:41.394 --> 00:10:42.692

192
00:10:44.048 --> 00:10:46.048
I wouldn't run around like a vigilante

thank you for having me Nance

331
00:20:33.117 --> 00:20:34.532
it's a pleasure as always

332
00:20:34.532 --> 00:20:36.532
you're running against a subjective mirror

333
00:20:36.532 --> 00:20:37.479
in Brad Ferrell

334
00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:38.952
both young and determined

335
00:20:38.952 --> 00:20:40.952
what do you think separates you?

336
00:20:40.952 --> 00:20:42.484
I'm well rounded Nance

337
00:20:42.484 --> 00:20:44.484
I actual come from these neighborhoods

338
00:20:44.484 --> 00:20:45.957
that the media tries to destroy

339
00:20:45.957 --> 00:20:47.899
no offense

340
00:20:47.899 --> 00:20:50.426
but I been around the block

341
00:20:50.426 --> 00:20:53.070
I have and education in Harvard Law

342
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.070
so for lack of a better term

343
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.543
I've been around the world

344
00:20:56.543 --> 00:20:58.543
my I ask what is your goal

345
00:20:58.543 --> 00:21:00.543
when you become mayor of this fine city

346
00:21:00.543 --> 00:21:02.543
I plan to pick up where the old mayor

347
00:21:02.543 --> 00:21:04.543
left off but do it the right way

348
00:21:04.543 --> 00:21:06.543
I want to make sure we have

349
00:21:06.543 --> 00:21:08.250
everything we need

350
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.777
umm there comes a time where we

351
00:21:10.777 --> 00:21:13.128
have to stand up for ourselves

352
00:21:13.128 --> 00:21:16.064
cause waiting on the man was not cutting it

353
00:21:16.064 --> 00:21:18.591
you know as my father always said

354
00:21:18.591 --> 00:21:22.522
you have to fix yourself because

355
00:21:22.522 --> 00:21:25.166
tools don't grow on trees

356
00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:27.751

367
00:21:55.943 --> 00:21:57.943

368
00:21:57.943 --> 00:21:59.943

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.600
have people

451
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.600

452
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.000
working for me

453
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.756

454
00:26:23.756 --> 00:26:25.756
low level

455
00:26:25.756 --> 00:26:27.756

464
00:26:46.214 --> 00:26:48.740

tell me what she needs to hear

469
00:27:27.673 --> 00:27:30.237

470
00:27:33.408 --> 00:27:36.520
someone from you past is

471
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.000

474
00:27:49.619 --> 00:27:51.794
metaphorically speaking

475
00:27:51.794 --> 00:27:53.794

476
00:27:53.794 --> 00:27:55.794

477
00:27:55.794 --> 00:27:57.794

478
00:27:57.794 --> 00:27:59.794

479
00:27:59.794 --> 00:28:01.794
they have secrets

480
00:28:01.794 --> 00:28:05.900
{music}

481
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.900
this person is in the wind

482
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.900
in the wind

483
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.900
{music}

484
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:17.060

if you don't give me some good news

488
00:28:25.459 --> 00:28:27.459
the next card you pull

489
00:28:27.459 --> 00:28:29.459
will be your death card

490
00:28:29.459 --> 00:28:33.624
spirits

491
00:28:33.624 --> 00:28:36.736
tell me what this bitch need to hear

492
00:28:36.736 --> 00:28:38.736
so we can get Mrs. Khan on her way

493
00:28:38.867 --> 00:28:40.867
right now

494
00:28:40.867 --> 00:28:42.867
{music}

495
00:28:42.867 --> 00:28:44.867

knight of cups

497
00:28:46.867 --> 00:28:52.670

and the ten of cups

504
00:29:08.065 --> 00:29:09.819
is usually someone you married

505
00:29:09.819 --> 00:29:11.819
or been with a long time

506
00:29:11.819 --> 00:29:14.543

I was embarrassed

687
00:41:23.823 --> 00:41:25.823

735
00:45:44.512 --> 00:45:46.512
I never took you for a man

736
00:45:46.512 --> 00:45:48.512
of such class and elegance

737
00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:51.156
on the contrary my brother

738
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:55.390
I ain't expect you to be who you are either man

739
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:58.970
and why may I ask?

740
00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:02.560
I see you a ghetto smooth talking man

741
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.000
of the people

742
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
shhhh

743
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.590
man don't tell nobody

744
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:09.063
the white people don't know about that

745
00:46:09.063 --> 00:46:10.000
they think I'm Obama

746
00:46:11.529 --> 00:46:13.529

00:46:13.529 --> 00:46:15.529

748
00:46:15.529 --> 00:46:18.875
umm I must be honest with you

749
00:46:18.875 --> 00:46:20.875
I was very reluctant to work with you

750
00:46:20.875 --> 00:46:21.900
Mr. Khan

751
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.405
I would imagine so

752
00:46:22.405 --> 00:46:25.517
I tell ya

753
00:46:25.517 --> 00:46:27.517
what makes me so different from

754
00:46:27.517 --> 00:46:29.517
the teamsters back in the day

755
00:46:29.517 --> 00:46:33.331
shit they funded the president

756
00:46:33.331 --> 00:46:35.682
you a politician right

757
00:46:35.682 --> 00:46:37.682
well actually there's no difference

758
00:46:37.858 --> 00:46:39.858
except the color of your skin brotha

759
00:46:39.858 --> 00:46:41.858
I mean we live in a country where

760
00:46:41.858 --> 00:46:43.858
a white boy can bomb a church and get away with it

761
00:46:43.858 --> 00:46:45.858
get off scot-free

762
00:46:45.858 --> 00:46:47.858
but you ain't even safe in your own home

763
00:46:47.858 --> 00:46:49.858
isn't that ironic

764
00:46:49.858 --> 00:46:53.858
life is funny isn't it

765
00:46:53.858 --> 00:46:56.501
we come from the same walk of life

766
00:46:56.501 --> 00:46:59.145
the only difference is you went to

767
00:46:59.145 --> 00:47:01.555
a fancy institution

768
00:47:01.555 --> 00:47:04.598

1036
01:05:17.678 --> 01:05:18.390
some bad news

1037
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:19.571
some shocking news

1038
01:05:19.571 --> 01:05:20.927
James cut the bullshit

1039
01:05:20.927 --> 01:05:22.401
give me all three

1040
01:05:22.401 --> 01:05:24.401
for starters I know who you were working for

1041
01:05:24.401 --> 01:05:26.811
I been trying to take them down for years

1042
01:05:26.811 --> 01:05:29.572
ever heard of Delilah Khan

1043
01:05:29.572 --> 01:05:31.631
no I don't

1044
01:05:31.631 --> 01:05:33.631
well she's married to Sampson Khan

1045
01:05:33.631 --> 01:05:35.631
a known criminal

1046
01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:37.631
and together they have this

1047
01:05:37.631 --> 01:05:39.631
underground life stay out of the public eye

1048
01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:41.631
and only come in town to eat

1049
01:05:41.631 --> 01:05:43.631
what does this have to do with Charley

1050
01:05:43.631 --> 01:05:45.631
what does that have to do with Shane

1051
01:05:45.631 --> 01:05:47.338
Shane?

1052
01:05:47.338 --> 01:05:49.338
see I been tracking Sampson for years

1053
01:05:49.338 --> 01:05:51.338
and never comes out to play

1054
01:05:51.338 --> 01:05:55.620
but that's until he meets his new best friend

1055
01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.493
I'm sure it's for a reason

1056
01:05:59.493 --> 01:06:03.307
as far as my sister you should handle it

1057
01:06:03.307 --> 01:06:04.304
I see people like to

1058
01:06:04.304 --> 01:06:06.243
take the law in their own hands

1059
01:06:06.243 --> 01:06:08.243
who like you?

1060
01:06:08.243 --> 01:06:11.179
you don't think I know about your past Camille?

1061
01:06:11.179 --> 01:06:12.477
even when we were dating

1062
01:06:12.477 --> 01:06:13.775
you would disappear

1063
01:06:13.775 --> 01:06:17.062
you know I even found blood on your jacket

1064
01:06:19.647 --> 01:06:22.700
all I take is defense classes James

1065
01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:24.700
I just want to protect myself

1066
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.700
and my family

1067
01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.700
you already have two family members

1068
01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.402
close to those beautiful iron bars

1069
01:06:31.402 --> 01:06:33.402
don't make me take you in

1070
01:06:57.011 --> 01:06:59.011

but I was worried about you

1076
01:07:11.703 --> 01:07:15.703
Mama Dee she stopped worrying

1077
01:07:15.703 --> 01:07:17.703
said you was weak and fuck it

1078
01:07:17.703 --> 01:07:19.703
I guess she really did care about you

1079
01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.703

1080
01:07:21.703 --> 01:07:27.039

01:11:12.144 --> 01:11:14.144
let me tell you something about me personally

1147
01:11:14.144 --> 01:11:17.724
as a professional well known ball hogger myself

1148
01:11:17.724 --> 01:11:18.360
I swear

1149
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.251
this man Kerry

1150
01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:21.540
is going to gaurentee himself

1151
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:25.597
35 points a game

1152
01:11:25.597 --> 01:11:28.182
and even more

1153
01:11:28.182 --> 01:11:30.182
man you like the sound of your own voice don't you

1154
01:11:30.182 --> 01:11:31.714
I love it I put it on recording

1155
01:11:31.714 --> 01:11:33.070
and wake up to it

1156
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:35.714
give him over time

1157
01:11:35.714 --> 01:11:37.714
man you writing checks your ego can't cash

1158
01:11:37.714 --> 01:11:39.714
but the bank will cash them

1159
01:11:39.714 --> 01:11:41.714
back up the truck

1160
01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.070
you know what?

1161
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.899
I'm tired of this bull

1162
01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:45.899
when we come back

1163
01:11:45.899 --> 01:11:49.713
we will have more to talk about

1164
01:11:49.713 --> 01:11:51.713
I'm Nancy Barnes and today

1165
01:11:51.713 --> 01:11:53.713
I'm sitting with mayoral candidate Brad Ferrell

1166
01:11:53.713 --> 01:11:55.713
thanks for having me Nance

1167
01:11:57.713 --> 01:11:59.713
listen

1168
01:11:59.713 --> 01:12:01.713
I want to use this time to talk about

1169
01:12:01.713 --> 01:12:03.538
the crisis in our city

1170
01:12:03.772 --> 01:12:05.416
remember when this city

1171
01:12:05.416 --> 01:12:07.613
used to be one big family?

1172
01:12:07.613 --> 01:12:09.283
we used to walk outside our door

1173
01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:10.585
and play with our friends

1174
01:12:10.585 --> 01:12:12.268
until the street lights come on

1175
01:12:12.268 --> 01:12:14.268
not a worry in the world

1176
01:12:14.268 --> 01:12:16.268
some say you not the man for the job

1177
01:12:16.268 --> 01:12:18.268
I'm aware

1178
01:12:18.268 --> 01:12:20.268
I'm aware of the change that

1179
01:12:20.268 --> 01:12:21.975
needs to take place

1180
01:12:21.975 --> 01:12:23.180
and I know what it takes to lift this

1181
01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:25.321
city out of the mud and clean it up

1182
01:12:25.321 --> 01:12:26.756
you're running against councilman

1183
01:12:26.756 --> 01:12:29.252
Shane Sanders

1184
01:12:29.252 --> 01:12:33.417
Mr. Sanders is well familiar with this city

1185
01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:37.417
Nancy you bet not make me look bad

1186
01:12:37.417 --> 01:12:40.000
or I'll release that sextape from back in the days

1187
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
what are your thoughts about his

1188
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
keep it real approach

1189
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.702
you can only as real and far as you have been

1190
01:12:46.702 --> 01:12:48.702
and he hasn't been anywhere

1191
01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:50.702
he's a novice

1192
01:12:50.702 --> 01:12:55.569
with him this world will be very difficult

1193
01:12:55.569 --> 01:12:58.622
some say the same thing about you

1194
01:12:58.622 --> 01:12:59.569
Mr. Ferrell

1195
01:12:59.569 --> 01:13:01.569
some say you only care about the rich

1196
01:13:01.569 --> 01:13:04.154
some say you only care about yourselfs

1197
01:13:04.154 --> 01:13:06.154
some say you don't even respect the city

1198
01:13:06.154 --> 01:13:08.681
how can a man save a city he doesn't respect

1199
01:13:08.681 --> 01:13:11.149
respect is earned

1200
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:13.149
and that's what we need to change

1201
01:13:13.149 --> 01:13:15.149
respect needs to be given

1202
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:18.261
and when we respect ourselves

1203
01:13:18.261 --> 01:13:21.022
we will be able to respect the place we live

1204
01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:23.022
resepct?

1205
01:13:23.022 --> 01:13:24.027
Mr. Ferrell

1206
01:13:24.027 --> 01:13:25.559
you have allegations of

1207
01:13:25.559 --> 01:13:27.559
starting programs and pocketing all the money

1208
01:13:27.559 --> 01:13:30.437
is that such criteria to run the city?

1209
01:13:31.969 --> 01:13:33.969
Nancy people will call me all kinds of names

1210
01:13:33.969 --> 01:13:36.320
or put barriers in my way

1211
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.320
but we shall prevail

1212
01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.100
you said you was opening

1213
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.100
community centers for the less fortunate

1214
01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.100
but just last Friday you said some

1215
01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:45.776
some funds for the city

1216
01:13:45.776 --> 01:13:49.616
should be spent on more roads and more events

1217
01:13:49.616 --> 01:13:51.616
which one is it?

1218
01:13:51.616 --> 01:13:52.446
Nance you know I didn't

1219
01:13:52.446 --> 01:13:53.977
say any of those things

1220
01:13:53.977 --> 01:13:55.450
what I said was

1221
01:13:55.450 --> 01:13:56.906
we need to let the people decide

1222
01:13:56.906 --> 01:13:58.035
where the funds go

1223
01:13:58.035 --> 01:13:59.481
and if the people want

1224
01:13:59.481 --> 01:14:01.100
easier transportation

1225
01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.515
and they want more festivals

1226
01:14:02.515 --> 01:14:03.696
for their families

1227
01:14:03.696 --> 01:14:05.696
well I need to listen to the people

1228
01:14:09.286 --> 01:14:13.685
I believe I found what you been looking for

1229
01:14:18.101 --> 01:14:20.920
hell yeah that's what I'm talking bout

1230
01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:22.920
my people are looking for yall

1231
01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.920
I suggest you clean this up

1232
01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.920
and get gone for a while

1233
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:30.383
man only breaks are in Hollywood

1234
01:14:32.383 --> 01:14:35.500
here's your shit

1235
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.500
this why I do this

1236
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:40.300
the money is easy and I go about my way

1237
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.020
the less I know the better I'm out

1238
01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.514
yeah the money's easy

1239
01:14:46.514 --> 01:14:50.700
let Sampson know he owes me big

1240
01:15:14.864 --> 01:15:16.864
it's hot as a motherfucka

1241
01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.919
you don't get tired of this shit?

1242
01:15:25.919 --> 01:15:27.919

1243
01:15:27.919 --> 01:15:29.919

what do you know about Lanae Barnes murder?

1264
01:16:25.897 --> 01:16:28.833
I believe you know her as Diamond

1265

01:16:33.466 --> 01:16:35.583
cross the west end where you belong

1268
01:16:35.583 --> 01:16:38.227
Latoya this is not a fucking game

1269
01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:40.227

1270
01:16:40.227 --> 01:16:42.227

I'm homicide I'm about bodies

1274
01:16:52.381 --> 01:16:55.903
so yes I do have shit on you

1275
01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:58.547
guilty by association

that's bullshit how?

1277
01:17:03.366 --> 01:17:07.941
Latoya Miles also known as Divine

1278
01:17:07.941 --> 01:17:09.941
better known as Vonnie

1279
01:17:09.941 --> 01:17:11.941
prior charges include

1280
01:17:11.941 --> 01:17:13.941
one count of possession

1281
01:17:13.941 --> 01:17:16.372
one count of solicitation

1282
01:17:16.372 --> 01:17:17.872
simple battery

1283
01:17:17.872 --> 01:17:19.872

1284
01:17:22.574 --> 01:17:24.633
sounds like a string of bad luck to me

1285
01:17:24.633 --> 01:17:25.434
that's all

1286
01:17:25.434 --> 01:17:27.434
going to be a whole lot more of it

1287
01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:30.000

1288
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.239

1293
01:17:38.166 --> 01:17:38.762

keep bullshitting

1295
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
but we can't always be there

1296
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
remember that when you protecting

1297
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
someone you don't even know

1298
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
you know

1299
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Lanae was going to be a doctor before

1300
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.766
she got strung out

1301
01:17:51.766 --> 01:17:53.766
Barnes made her decision

1302
01:17:53.766 --> 01:17:57.100
now it's time for you to make yours

1303
01:18:20.959 --> 01:18:23.060

1308
01:18:35.834 --> 01:18:38.480
Mama Dee the cops knocked Vonnie

01:18:53.782 --> 01:18:56.075
True But

1318
01:18:56.075 --> 01:18:59.421

1319
01:18:59.421 --> 01:19:01.421
I can't afford loose strings

1320
01:19:01.421 --> 01:19:03.421

Mama Dee please spare Vonnie

01:19:14.874 --> 01:19:16.231

I know what's best for you

1331
01:19:36.844 --> 01:19:39.546

1332
01:19:39.546 --> 01:19:44.063

1333
01:19:46.063 --> 01:19:48.063

1334
01:20:00.304 --> 01:20:01.894

01:20:01.894 --> 01:20:03.894
I wouldn't go in there if I were you

1336
01:20:03.894 --> 01:20:05.543
I'm good

1337
01:20:05.543 --> 01:20:07.367

1338
01:20:07.367 --> 01:20:09.367

1339
01:20:16.069 --> 01:20:18.069

1341
01:20:21.005 --> 01:20:23.005
so when you were going to

1342
01:20:23.064 --> 01:20:25.064
tell me you got picked up?

1343
01:20:25.064 --> 01:20:26.479
there wasn't nothing to tell

1344
01:20:26.479 --> 01:20:28.479
they asked me a few questions

1345
01:20:28.479 --> 01:20:30.479
I ain't tell them shit

1346
01:20:30.479 --> 01:20:32.479
so they let me go simple

1347
01:20:32.479 --> 01:20:34.479
Hmph

1348
01:20:36.011 --> 01:20:38.713
If only it were so simple

1349
01:20:41.942 --> 01:20:43.942
you know

1350
01:20:43.942 --> 01:20:47.346

1351
01:20:47.346 --> 01:20:49.346
constantly in trouble

1352
01:20:49.346 --> 01:20:51.346
over and over again

1353
01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:53.346
you are uncoachable

1354
01:20:53.346 --> 01:20:55.346
unreachable

1355
01:20:55.346 --> 01:20:58.458

I grew up with the detective

1365
01:21:29.519 --> 01:21:31.987

1366
01:21:35.567 --> 01:21:37.977

1367
01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:42.426

1368
01:21:42.426 --> 01:21:46.232

1370
01:21:48.897 --> 01:21:51.179
