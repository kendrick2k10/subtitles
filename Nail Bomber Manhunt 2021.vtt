00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.360
I got a little nail in the leg.

171
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.320
I can't believe he didn't get hit.
He was in front. That's mad.

172
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.000
There's people with. like. limbs missing.
with nails in their head. I thought.

173
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.960
"Why do I need to waste a stretcher
going to hospital with a nail?"

174
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.400
-[man 5] They cut his jeans up.
-[Lee] It hit me in the leg.

175
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.240
So. me mum just bought me these
for me birthday.

176
00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.240
"Don't cut my jeans! My mum got me these
for my birthday." I'll never forget that.

177
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.360
[Talent] There were glasses
all over the place.

178
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.400
Because I wasn't hurt.

179
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.400
I was grateful for that.

180
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.960
Most people around there.

181
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.000
there were lots of casualties.

182
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.320
Everybody were running all over the place

183
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.240
trying to find out
if their loved ones are safe.

184
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.520
It was a horror in the day.

185
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.840
[suspenseful music playing]

186
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.040
[tape recorder clicks]

187
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.800
[Johnstone] Did you think
of the consequences?

188
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.400
[suspect] No.

189
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.120
On the train.
I just kept imagining it exploding.

190
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.720
I had to do it.

191
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.360
I was like a robot.

192
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.360
[Johnstone] Did you think of the…

193
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.120
the people?

194
00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.480
[suspect] No.

195
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.800
Not at all.

196
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.200
[tense music playing]

197
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.640
[man 6] Thirty-nine people were injured.

198
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.000
including a child with a four-inch nail

199
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.720
embedded in their skull.

200
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.720
[sirens wailing]

201
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.560
The combination of burns
and blast injuries

202
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.800
with severe shrapnel injuries
is a very difficult thing to deal with.

203
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.680
This bomb was designed

204
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.080
to kill as many people as possible.

205
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.400
and it is miraculous
that nobody lost their life on that day.

206
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.320
The whole design of a nail bomb

207
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.240
is-- is to do the maximum amount of harm

208
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.120
to the maximum number of people.
to kill as many people as possible.

209
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.560
Putting fragments of metal inside a bomb

210
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.640
and-- and then exploding.

211
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.080
it's going to carry this metal

212
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.040
300 miles an hour.

213
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.520
Nails are accompanied by anything else

214
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.440
that the blast wave picks up on the way.

215
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.640
And as it moves through different people.

216
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.480
it can carry bits of one person

217
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.240
into another.

218
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.000
So. you end up with very complex wounds

219
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.960
where bits of somebody's leg

220
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.520
can end up… end up in their chest.

221
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.120
or they can end up in the chest
of the next person.

222
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.360
We had never seen anything
quite like this before.

223
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.280
You join me in the heart of Brixton

224
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.320
where the mood is one of rising anger

225
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.040
against whoever was responsible
for the nail bomb.

226
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.120
[man 7] Brixton is a very tense area.

227
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.800
We just want to sort out
what happened Saturday.

228
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.080
and we take it from there.

229
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.280
With me now is Mike Franklin.

230
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.920
He's from the community police
consultative group.

231
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.920
Mike. I've seen today how high tensions
are running here.

232
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.960
Yes. uh. people are angry.

233
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.160
This was a-- a-- a cowardly.
callous attack on innocent people

234
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.480
going about their lawful
daily business in Brixton on Saturday.

235
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.800
Limbs amputated.

236
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.040
shredding injuries
from-- from-- from nails.

237
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.400
People that-- deafened. blinded.

238
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.000
It wasn't a bomb.
a bit of a loud noise down the road.

239
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.360
This was--
This-this ruined people's lives.

240
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.640
Police were very. very careful
not to jump to conclusions.

241
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.520
You know. they wanted to say.
"We're keeping an open mind

242
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.720
about what the motivation of this is."

243
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.840
[tense music playing]

244
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.880
I thought it was a racist attack.

245
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.320
Instinctively.

246
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.040
You live--
live down here and that happens.

247
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.120
and you normally have an idea.

248
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.360
And you had police officers
saying things to you like. you know.

249
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.480
"We wanna catch the bomber
as much as you do."

250
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.560
And you'd say to them. "No. no. you don't.
because. like. where do you live?"

251
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.520
"You're not living in an area
that's a target for this."

252
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.840
And the fact that the bomber
didn't kill anybody the first time around.

253
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.000
there's a possibility he might come back.

254
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.160
[man 8] You know.
London had had bombings before.

255
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.360
The IRA campaigns. you know.
weren't that distant a memory.

256
00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.960
[reporter 1] This morning.
evidence taken from the wrecked building

257
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.760
is being minutely examined
by the bomb squad.

258
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.120
One theory is that the attack

259
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.160
was a calculated act of defiance
by the IRA

260
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.000
after the discovery in Southampton…

261
00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.200
But what we hadn't had experience of

262
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.800
was a bomb of that type

263
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.680
in the middle of a pedestrianized
shopping high street.

264
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.920
[phone ringing]

265
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.680
Annette. hi. Simon Foy here.

266
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.680
I was the young.
fresh-faced. inexperienced.

267
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.840
quite aspiring.

268
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.600
probably slightly naive

269
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.880
potential commander to Brixton Division.

270
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.920
It was the most challenging place
to… to work.

271
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.880
[uneasy music playing]

272
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.360
It was quite a tense atmosphere.

273
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.680
There was lots and lots of speculation

274
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.200
about what was going on
and who was responsible for it.

275
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.920
A whole load of reasons
went through my mind.

276
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.120
We knew there was some gang violence
brewing up.

277
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.680
and there had been some shootings
fairly recently.

278
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.120
Was it that?

279
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.680
And people were sort of saying.
"Come on. then…"

280
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.960
You know.
"What are you gonna do about it?"

281
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.800
[man 9] Don't you think. sir. it is time

282
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.760
to come clean and say
you have not got enough police officers

283
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.200
to do the job that is necessary
within this community?

284
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.360
[Franklin] People felt under-protected
and over-policed.

285
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.960
We'd all been through
the Brixton riots of '81.

286
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.120
Deaths in custody.
we'd been through all that stuff.

287
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.560
so a lot of us in the community

288
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.600
weren't that happy or comfortable

289
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.000
working with the police.
'cause we didn't trust them.

290
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.560
[man 10] The police are harassing members
of our community through stop and search.

291
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.480
The police announced
that they're going to swamp our area

292
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.120
because of the bombing.

293
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.400
[Franklin] Police stop and search was
a real issue when I was young growing up.

294
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.880
Going into Brixton
on a Saturday afternoon with friends.

295
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.800
to record shops. things like that.

296
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.280
One of the things
that would happen most Saturdays

297
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.160
is you'd be stopped and searched
by the police.

298
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.680
[reporter 2] The senior policeman
who runs this area was telling me

299
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.920
that the advice he'd give you lot

300
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.920
is to think seriously
about joining the police force.

301
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.080
-He hasn't got enough--
-[youths laughing]

302
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.680
[Franklin] Friends got taken
to the police station.

303
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.920
come out with bruises.

304
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.920
and they'd tell you they got punched
in the face by a police officer.

305
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.760
That was-- That was fairly normal.

306
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.080
[crowd shouting]

307
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.440
Those were the things
that  sowed the seeds of antipathy

308
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.120
between the community and the police.

309
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.120
Now to the day's other news.

310
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.000
Detectives investigating
yesterday's bomb explosion

311
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.440
in Brixton in South London

312
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.720
say they're keeping an open mind
about who planted the device.

313
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.680
The attack has not been linked
to a known terrorist group.

314
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.560
Were you here last Saturday?

315
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.360
[man 11] We've had lots of people
that have come forward.

316
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.800
uh. but no one has been able to tell us

317
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.080
anything particular. uh. about the bomber
at this moment in time.

318
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.320
[man 12] No one really had a clue
of anything.

319
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.680
Was it a group of people?
Was it one person?

320
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.040
It created real fear.

321
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.640
The police were not really monitoring
the far right at that time.

322
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.160
They say they were and people
were getting picked up every now and then.

323
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.880
but there was a mindset at the top
of the security services

324
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.760
saying that the far right
weren't a threat.

325
00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.840
They just wrote about these things.
they weren't going to carry it out.

326
00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.880
You know. just a bunch of hooligans.
Why are we having to look at these people?

327
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.720
Searchlight was
a private intelligence operation.

328
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.040
We infiltrated and monitored
fascist groups.

329
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.640
[crowd chanting] Rights for whites!
Rights for whites!

330
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.240
[man 12]
We'd been warning about it for years.

331
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.440
Terrorist movement
defending the last stand.

332
00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.920
taking on the system.

333
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.120
Kind of an underground guerrilla army.

334
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.320
And it was all about terrorism.
All about killing people.

335
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.840
[crowd chanting] Sieg Hiel! Sieg Hiel!

336
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.400
Sieg Hiel! Sieg Hiel! Sieg Hiel!

337
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.800
[man 12] These were dangerous times.
and we wanted to stop these people.

338
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.920
The more we can find out
what they're up to. the more we can…

339
00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.360
stop what they're doing.

340
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.960
draw attention to what they're doing.

341
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.840
And then. we were contacted by someone

342
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.640
volunteering to get involved.

343
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.240
Hello. Searchlight.

344
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.560
Said he was a young lad in his early 20s.
who was political.

345
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.200
very. very anti-racist.

346
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.760
Obviously. from my perspective.
the best thing he could do

347
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.560
was to go inside the far right.

348
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.280
And that's what he did.

349
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.080
[siren wailing in distance]

350
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.760
[man 1] Is it important
to still keep your identity a secret?

351
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.680
[man 2] Yeah.

352
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.080
'Cause. like. these guys
really are dangerous.

353
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.440
[man 1] And they still believe
that you're a Nazi?

354
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.040
[man 2] Yeah.

355
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.880
[man 1] Why did you do it?

356
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.640
[man 2] I like being a spy. It's. um…

357
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.080
[exhaling]

358
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.040
It's a buzz.

359
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.640
[man 1] Can you start at the beginning.
Arthur?

360
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.640
[Arthur] In 1999.
I was undercover in the BNP.

361
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
[Tyndall] For the new century.
we need a new ideal.

362
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.160
a new kind of politics.

363
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.200
[Arthur] The British National Party
was the law and order party.

364
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.080
[Tyndall] We must stop immigration.

365
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.880
and we must help the immigrants
return home.

366
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.920
[Arthur] We projected ourselves
as being decent.

367
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.800
honorable. law-abiding citizens.

368
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.000
We were the good guys.

369
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.000
To build a movement.
which in the coming century

370
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.360
will put the "great" back into Britain.

371
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.240
[Arthur] But behind that.

372
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.920
you'd be going to. like. a BNP meeting

373
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.200
at a church hall or. like.
a back room of a pub.

374
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:55.880
Fuck off.

375
00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.400
[Arthur] And people were. like.
distributing hit lists.

376
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.200
overtly Nazi propaganda.

377
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.920
bomb manuals.

378
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.480
It was their dream that someone
would go out and blow up

379
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.240
someone they've suggested to target.

380
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.240
So. it was pretty extreme.

381
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.160
My assumption was

382
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.680
that they'd keep the Nazi thing

383
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.120
out of the way for new recruits.

384
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.400
but straight away they were saying
killing Jews was a good thing.

385
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.640
-[man 1] First day?
-[Arthur] First day. yeah.

386
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.400
[man 1] What did you think?

387
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.120
[Arthur] The thing was. I was shocked.
I was scared. but I was also excited.

388
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.480
And also. like. the fact
that they were so overtly Nazi.

389
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.680
that's more reason to carry on. isn't it?

390
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.240
[man 1] Did you feel people
were checking you out?

391
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.800
Were they sussing you out?

392
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.320
[Arthur] Not really. no.

393
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.520
I guess they were thinking that

394
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.520
why wouldn't any white man
want to join their organization?

395
00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.520
-[crowd shouting]
-[car alarm blaring]

396
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.840
[Arthur] Obviously. the anti-fascists
had no idea I was on their side.

397
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.440
So. there were a few times I got whacked.

398
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.120
The worst time was actually--
It was. like. a girl.

399
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.200
and. um. like. she was smashing me
over the head with. I think. a hammer.

400
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.680
This was my reality.

401
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.680
[unsettling music playing]

402
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.800
[suspenseful music playing]

403
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.520
[tape recorder clicks]

404
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.040
[Boland] What do you believe in. son?

405
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.360
[suspect] We've got so many
poor white people in this country.

406
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.800
You get all this bullshit.

407
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.200
everything has to be equal.
everything this…

408
00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.000
It just puts white--

409
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.200
It demeans the white man
in this country now.

410
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.320
People like me.

411
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.480
[Boland] So. you wanted
to put some bombs down?

412
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.280
[suspect] Yeah. yeah. As many as I could.

413
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.800
One a week.

414
00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.040
[Johnstone] Why did you put nails in them?

415
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.640
[suspect] It means they'd smash windows.
stick into people. and maim people.

416
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.720
And kill people.

417
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.840
[somber music playing]

418
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.600
[stopwatch ticking]

419
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.640
[brooding music playing]

420

[clock beeps]

421
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.400
[recorder playing scale]

422
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.760
[explosion]

423

-[crowd screaming]

425

[sirens wailing]

426
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.760
[reporter 3] The second weekend
in the capital.

427
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.240
it appears that ethnic communities
have once again been targeted

428
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.440
in an attack without any warning.

429
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.360
[reporter 4] Brick Lane
is sealed off tonight.

430
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.840
and as well as a sense of shock.

431
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.600
there's also a sense of relief
that nobody was actually killed.

432
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.520
This strikes at the heart
of the-- the Bengali community.

433
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.600
We have a problem.
which is tantamount to racial terrorism.

434
00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.720
[camera shutters clicking]

435
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.680
These things are… are outrageous.
that we will not tolerate.

436
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.480
and we'll make every effort
to find out who-- those responsible.

437
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.360
They'll be prosecuted
and brought to justice.

438
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.480
No doubt about that.

439
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.720
With me is Siddy Shivdasani.
who's the editor of Eastern Eye newspaper.

440
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.560
We've received. uh. death threats
even today at our offices.

441
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.320
We actually warned our readers last week.

442
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.040
if you live in a Black or Asian area
to be aware.

443
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.960
Whilst politicians and the police

444
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.320
were dithering about
whether it was a racial crime.

445
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.080
in the meantime.
they were planning their next attack.

446
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.960
[Shivdasani] I was just trying
to get my message out there

447
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.120
of my personal frustration
with the police.

448
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.800
You know. try and do the right thing.

449
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.240
That's what I was trying to do then.
to do the right thing.

450
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.680
I was editor of a British Asian paper
at the time.

451
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.880
We faced a fair bit of racism.

452
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.240
[scoffs] Oh. you just got
used to it after a while.

453
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.320
and it was just a bit mindless. really.

454
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.760
But then we got this letter.

455
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.000
It was from some group called
the White Wolves.

456
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.040
I knew that an Asian area
was gonna be targeted next. I felt it.

457
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.360
But the police gave us no advice
to look for anything suspicious

458
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.560
or to be vigilant. Nothing.

459
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.640
We felt like they didn't give a fuck.

460
00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.600
[news jingle playing]

461
00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.840
The homemade bomb
that exploded in South London on Saturday

462
00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.040
seemed to have been an act of lunacy.

463
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.920
Tonight. you can help. and this is how.

464
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.720
This is the quantity of nails
packed around the explosives.

465
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.080
Who bought this lot?

466
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.320
It wasn't a regular customer.
wasn't a regular builder.

467
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.800
Who came in
for this sort of quantity of nails?

468
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.120
Alan Fry is head
of the Anti-Terrorist branch.

469
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.320
Alan. has it taken you any further.
what you've got so far? Do you know?

470
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.600
I'm-- I'm sure it has.

471
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.760
although it's-- it's too soon.
uh. to be able to. uh. be particular

472
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.800
in regard to a--
a particular line of inquiry.

473
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.480
Well. if there's any way that you think
you can help. please. please do.

474
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.000
There's a £10.000 reward. That may go up.

475
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.600
[woman 2] There weren't many
serial killers in this country.

476
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.720
let alone there'd never been
a serial bomber.

477
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.800
You know. people were afraid.

478
00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.920
People were afraid.

479
00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.080
[tense music playing]

480
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.720
I was the senior investigating officer.

481
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.800
The responsibility was huge.

482
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.360
I had no experience
in-- in terrorism investigation.

483
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.480
It brought the pressure to a different--
a completely different level.

484
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.640
[reporter 5] Police are viewing
hours of tape

485
00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.520
from closed-circuit TV cameras

486
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.880
in the hope that the person
who planted the device

487
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.360
will have been caught on film
and someone may recognize them.

488
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.320
The quality of the CCTV in 1999

489
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.400
wasn't great.

490
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.320
However. we started to find images

491
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.400
that-- that might be the bomber.

492
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.160
There was someone
wearing a white baseball cap

493
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.560
who was carrying over their shoulder

494
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.880
what appeared to be a sports bag.

495
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.840
The only difficulty was

496
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.800
he wasn't recognizable.

497
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.520
We went to all sorts
of different agencies.

498
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.160
We even went to the Americans
and-- and the military.

499
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.400
I mean. we sent it out there hoping.

500
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.240
uh. that-- that someone could enhance it.

501
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.240
Um. they couldn't.

502
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.680
We had to just keep looking.

503
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.760
I started working with the police.

504
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.520
I mean. I did joint press conferences.

505
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.480
So. when they produced this picture
of an individual

506
00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.440
who may be the bomber.

507
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.920
there was arguments with me
about whether it should be published.

508
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.880

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.400
who-- who don't fit their perception
of normal society.

680
00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.080
We began having conversations
with the police at quite a senior level.

681
00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.640
We were told that it was a--
a racial issue.

682
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:14.840
And we raised our concerns.
and it was met with some skepticism

683
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.120
and some disbelief at Scotland Yard.

684
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.600
So it was really pretty much down to us

685
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:24.800
to ring round the managers
of the key venues.

686
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.680
the pubs. the clubs. the coffee bars.
the restaurants. to say…

687
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.320
"This could come to us.
Please be aware. Be vigilant."

688
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.680
[suspenseful music playing]

689
00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.440
We will defeat the people
who are responsible for these bombs.

690
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.560
We will catch them.

691
00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.320
We don't have specific corroboration
for any particular group.

692
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.200
uh. who are responsible
for these outrages.

693
00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.360
but clearly. it is--
it is most likely to be. um.

694
00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.320
far-right extremists
who are targeting minority groups.

695
00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.480
[man 12] Everyone was kind of blind to it.
'cause no one knew where it was coming.

696
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.680
But everyone was expecting
for it to happen.

697
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.520
I'd meet Arthur in places
where we thought

698
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.520
other people who knew him
or knew me wouldn't be.

699
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.640
Tourist hotels in London.

700
00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.440
meet outside London.

701
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.640
He understood what his mission was.

702
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.640
And he understood
that he had to stop them.

703
00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.520
[Arthur] I'd meet my contact

704
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.520
and go through all these names
of people I knew already…

705
00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.560
and mentioned this guy

706
00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.280
who I'd referred to as "Dave from Barking"

707
00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.080
because he-- he mentioned
that was where… where he was living.

708
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.800
We were a similar sort of age.

709
00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.800
bonded a little bit.

710
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.560
talked about music

711
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.920
and the fact he didn't like people
with brown faces very much.

712
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.680
I last saw him at the annual rally

713
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.720
when. um. he was acting like a-a steward.

714
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.640
He had. like. a steward's armband.
He stood next to John Tyndall.

715
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.840
I think Tyndall got quite badly beaten up
by anti-fascists.

716
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.960
After that. Dave just. like. disappeared.

717
00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.240
And I didn't think anything of him.

718
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.280
[projector clicking]

719
00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.360
[uneasy music playing]

720
00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.120
[tape recorder clicks. whirring]

721
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.880
[suspect] After Saturday at Brick Lane.

722
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.440
I got a taxi to Soho to do a bit of recon.

723
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.120
[Johnstone] Roughly what time
would this have been?

724
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.680
[suspect] Must've been about 7:00.

725
00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.800
[Johnstone] Right. So. what was
your intention at that point?

726
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.080
[suspect] I was thinking what pub
I was gonna blow up.

727
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.800
I went down to Old Compton Street.

728
00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.000
I wanted to make sure it was the right pub
'cause I was after a queer one.

729
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.720
A gay one or whatever you wanna call it.

730
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
[Boland] Have you got a problem
with gays. then?

731
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.000
-[suspect] Yeah. I have.
-[Boland] Why?

732
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.400
[suspect] I'm just very homophobic.

733
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.480
That's pretty-- You know. I just hate 'em.

734
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.400
[Johnstone] Why?

735
00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.480
[suspect] I don't know. You just do.

736
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.160
[Johnstone] There must be a reason.

737
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.200
[suspect] I got a thing about homosexuals.

738
00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.280
I just don't like talking about it.
you know what I mean?

739
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.560
I chose the gays 'cause I hate them.

740
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.640
You know? I mean. that was personal.

741
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.480
[Johnstone] The tape doesn't pick this up.
but when we speak to you about the gays.

742
00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:50.440
you-- you have to close your eyes.
and you seem quite intense there. David.

743
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.240
[David] Yeah. I just don't like them.

744
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.040
I just don't like them. yeah?

745
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.840
[stopwatch ticking]

746
00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.080
I'm completely straight.
Don't worry about that.

747
00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.240
[Johnstone] No. no. no.
It's not a problem. but it upsets you.

748
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.680
You know? I don't know why it upsets you.

749
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.320
It upset you enough to plant a bomb.

750
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.200
But I don't know why.

751
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.760
[unsettling music playing]

752
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.600
[reporter 7] After the two
Saturday afternoon bombings in London.

753
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.040
police forces around the country
are warning people

754
00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.520
who could be potential targets
to be vigilant this weekend.

755
00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.280
Detectives fear the Brick Lane
and Brixton bombs

756
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.320
could be the start of a nationwide
racist terror campaign.

757
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.200
Police say they don't want to spread panic

758
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.840
but want everyone to be aware
of the possible threat

759
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.320
of another bomb this bank holiday weekend.

760
00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.800
[suspenseful music playing]

761
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.200
[Foy] There were two things
that drew attention to the suspect.

762
00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.360
Instead of looking at thousands of people.

763
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.720
your job is to look at all those thousands
of people who might be carrying a bag.

764
00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:34.840
And then once that bag was found.
then there was the hat he was wearing.

765
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.320
But there was hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of hours.

766
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.080
[woman 2] At first. the images were so bad
you couldn't tell who it was.

767
00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.640
But then we started to find other images
that were clearer.

768
00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.680
The guys were straight down at my office.
"Boss. you've gotta see this."

769
00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.960
[Foy] I distinctly remember that moment.

770
00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.560
Here's the image. This is the bomber.

771
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.480
[thrilling music playing]

772
00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.840
[reporter 8] Before rush hour.
it was on posters at stations

773
00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.160
and other key locations
across the capital.

774
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.440
The images have been posted
on the internet

775
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.400
and are being sent
to every police force in the country.

776
00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.440
[reporter 9] Even though the police
suspect he may be behind the bombing.

777
00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.120
if he's watching this broadcast

778
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.120
and he honestly thinks he's innocent.
then he should come forward.

779
00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.800
[tape recorder clicks. whirring]

780
00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.160
[David] I heard on the radio
that you had pictures of me.

781
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.080
And at first. I thought.
"That's it. I'm caught."

782
00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:49.960
So. I've immediately gone straight home.
and I've realized I ain't been caught yet.

783
00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.920
I built my device. set the time.
I packed it all up.

784
00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.760
Waited till about half past four.
caught a taxi up to Soho.

785
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.960
[Johnstone] What time did you set
the timer up for the Soho bomb?

786
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.080
[David] Six thirty.

787
00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.520
[clock beeps]

788
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.000
[man 16] It was my day off.

789
00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:36.360
I think I'd been to a gallery.
and I was on my way home.

790
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.240
And it was a Friday.

791
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.640
beginning of a-- a holiday weekend.
The weather was glorious.

792
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.840
I think maybe it was late afternoon.

793
00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:52.760
There were people finishing work.
there was an-- an air of gaiety

794
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.840
and. you know.
it was like a holiday weekend.

795
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.160
There was an atmosphere.

796
00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:00.040
And I'd been into the Admiral Duncan
once before. I think.

797
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.120
Um. didn't really remember it
all that well.

798
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.320
and I was passing by. and I thought.

799
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.600
"Fancy a half a beer."

800
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.680
It was a small pub. Narrow.

801
00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.640
And it-it was sort of beginning
to be buzzing.

802
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.920
You know?
And people were arriving all the time.

803
00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.520
[suspenseful music playing]

804
00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.880
[Arthur] It was a Friday afternoon.

805
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:32.400
And I had heard the police
had identified footage from Brixton.

806
00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.880
I saw copies of the Evening Standard.

807
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.040
Pretty much straight away. I thought
that it might be Dave from Barking.

808
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.120
And then my contact at Searchlight phoned.

809
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.560
and I just said.

810
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.800
"It could be David Copeland."

811
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.880
[Foy] We started going through
our own records.

812
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.600
all the stuff that Arthur
had told us over the years.

813
00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.600
and. you know. there we found
Copeland's name

814
00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.560
in a number of different meetings.
a number of different events.

815
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.640
So a colleague of mine
contacted the police.

816
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:09.400
[clock beeps]

817
00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.360
[siren wailing]

818
00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.360
[suspenseful music rising]

819
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.000
[David] Looked at my watch.
I still had. what?

820
00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.320
An hour to go before the ignition?

821
00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.560
I sort of waited by the telephone box.

822
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.000
making it look
like I was waiting for the phone.

823
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.840
I went in there about I'd say ten--

824
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.200
ten to six.

825
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.080
Ordered a drink.

826
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.200
When I was in there. I seen the people
I was gonna maim and kill.

827
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.600
I didn't feel joy about it.

828
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.960
I didn't feel sad.

829
00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.920
I just didn't feel anything.

830
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.560
[Johnstone] And how long were you here for
at the end of the bar. you said?

831
00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.200
[David] Fifteen minutes. Twenty minutes.

832
00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.560
[Johnstone] Is that right?
You had a glass of Coke or something?

833
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.240
[David] A glass of Coke.

834
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.640
I left it there and I asked one of the men
in there if there was a bank nearby.

835
00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.360
[Johnstone] And this is just as you left.
was it now?

836
00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.800
-[David] Yeah.
-[Johnstone] Yeah.

837
00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.160
[Boland] How many people
were actually in the public house

838
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.960
when you actually put the bag down?
Do you remember?

839
00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.920
[David] Between 15 to 20 people.

840
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.480
I struggled to actually
get out of the place.

841
00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.840
I had to go around people
and ask them to move.

842
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:37.320
I knew that people would be killed.
but I had to do it.

843
00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.800

The noise level was getting louder.

Ordered the beer.

847
00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.120
I don't know whether I even sipped it.

848
00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:58.960
-And then…

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.400
[high-pitched ringing]

851
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.680
I couldn't hear anything.

852
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.840
Something's really strange.

853
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.240
I felt really strange.

854
00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.640
Everything switched off.

855
00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.000
I don't feel right.

856
00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.400
And I think that I was still
leaning on… on the bar.

857
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:35.920
And I looked across to where the optics
and-- and-- and things--

858
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.240
and the bottles should have been.
and there was nothing.

859
00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.760
Just darkness. wisps of smoke.

860
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.120
and nobody.

861
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.200
I-I couldn't see anybody.
couldn't hear anything.

862
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.200
And I can remember turning

863
00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.880
to-- to look to see what was going on.

864
00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.640
and then the next memory is of being…

865
00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.280
looking up at a-- a young woman.

866
00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:05.640
and I could see her mouth opening
and closing. screaming. I think.

[somber music playing]

868
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.560
I learnt later. if you're in a bomb.
your eardrums get blown.

869
00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:46.040
I think that I was dragged outside
and there was a guy

870
00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:50.160
who was with me and--
who said that I was talking to him.

871
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.320
I could tell him where I came from.

872
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.080
I don't remember any of that.
None. None of it.

873
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.160
I was taken to hospital.

874
00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.400
They didn't know whether I was gonna live.

875
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.800
They had me on some pretty strong drugs.

876
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.800
And I remember. sort of. dreaming
and things like that

877
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:29.480
while they were altering. um.
the level of-- of pain medication.

878
00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:34.840
I was having this dream about being
in a nightclub. and everybody was rats.

879
00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.720
And the rats were dressed
as human beings.

880

[eerie music playing]

881
00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.440
There were rats in the wall.
I could hear them.

882
00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.840
There was a-- a biplane.

883
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.640
You know. one of those planes
that goes onto the water?

884
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.800
That arrived at the… at the nightclub.

885
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.600
Rats. rats. and more rats.

886
00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.440

[liquid pouring]

888
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:19.280
I learned later that. um. Copeland
had let his rats--

889
00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.480
He had pet rats.

890
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:26.080
And he let them. um. run across the stuff
that he was packing the nail bombs with.

891
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.680
And. um. so. from what I can tell.

892
00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.960
the guys that were
in the same hospital as me.

893
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.800
um. we all got these weird infections.

894
00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.080
and they couldn't figure out
what was wrong with us.

895
00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.760
And it was all because
he let these rats…

896
00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.160
you know. like. urinate and defecate

897
00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.760

that he was jamming in there.

-[sirens wailing]

899
00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.880
[man 6] As these patients
came in one at a time.

900
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:10.080
we began to realize
just how serious this was.

901
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.560
They had quite horrific injuries.

902
00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.760
This was like a war scene.

903
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.880
Patients came in with extensive burns.

904
00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.280

905
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.400
one after another.

906
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:38.520
And perhaps the most difficult thing
I've had to do in my career

907
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:43.160
was dealing with a patient
who had come in unconscious.

908
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.680
and he remained unconscious
for a few days.

909
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.880
As he came round gradually.

910
00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.360
we realized that we had to speak to him

911
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:59.040
to give him the worst possible news.

912
00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:03.880
Two friends had both died

913
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:10.560
and tragically his wife and unborn child

914
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.040
had also been killed.

in the explosion.

921

It was just complete shock.

922
00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.960
And helplessness.

933

mean to you?

935

I-I don't understand.

you never existed.

941
00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:29.920

is about to finish.

for the bombings.

It is understood that he was working alone

[reporter 10] The start
of David Copeland's murder trial

962
00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:59.080
was attended by more
than three dozen of his victims

963
00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.280
and the relatives of those he killed.

964

The 24-year-old defendant
denies three murder charges

965
00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.800
due to diminished responsibility.

966
00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:12.400
[man 14] Copeland wouldn't be
the first person

967
00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.200
who thought he could get away with murder
by claiming he's mad.

968
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.240
I've got a massive problem with people

969
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.800
who harm women or children.

970
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.640
And so when Copeland happened--

971
00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.920
For-- He's murdered that woman.

972
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.800
and he's murdered an unborn child.

973
00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.240
You know. I was never gonna let him
get away with it.

974
00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.640
His only option really

975
00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.520
was to plead diminished responsibility.

976
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:49.960
so I needed him to confess
that he was perfectly sane.

977
00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:57.800
But these days. you've got
these pedophile hunters on the internet.

978
00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.840
and they pretend to be a male or a female.

979
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.360
and a pedophile
will get in touch with them.

980
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.480
they'll arrange to meet.
then they give the evidence to the police.

Well. if you like. before the internet.

How can they call people monsters and evil
without even knowing them?

I believe everyone is innocent
until proven guilty.

and he had a barrage of lawyers.

1010

He had. you know. more on-- on his side

1011

It's now for the jury to decide
his state of mind.

1016
01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.040
[man 14] Essentially. what I needed
was a smoking gun.

1017
01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.040
I needed him to say. you know. something

1018
01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.640
that showed he was playing a game
with the doctors.

1019
01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.200
but I didn't have a lot of time
to get him.

1020
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.640
[Patsy] Dear David.

1021
01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.600
I hope you're not too worried
about your trial.

1022
01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.040
It must be a stressful time for you.

1023
01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.920
[David] Dear Patsy.

1024
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.920
you are a very attractive young lady.

1025
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.120
[laughing]

1026
01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.640
Oh. you know.

1027
01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.440
My plan was to build Copeland up.

1028
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.640
By doing that. get him to open up.

1029
01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.640
[Patsy] I hope you're feeling confident
and thinking positive thoughts.

1030
01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.200
[David] It feels strange being famous.

1031
01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.760
[Patsy] Dear David.

1032
01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.280
I saw your picture in the papers
the other day.

1033
01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.640
Your mum is right.
You really are handsome.

1034
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.960
[David] Dear Patsy.

1035
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.600
I can't get you out of my mind.

1036
01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.600
All I do is dream about you
and when we can finally meet.

1037
01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:00.960
And he signed that "Love. Dave."
which was an escalation of things. really.

1038
01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.120
The whole mood
of Copeland's letters changed.

1039
01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.560
[David] Dear Patsy…

1040
01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.320
[man 14] I had a…
a flurry of letters at that point.

1041
01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.120
[David] Your letters are the only things
that are keeping me going here.

1042
01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.640
I lie on my bed at night
and think of you.

1043
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.120
Promise me. Patsy.
you'll never forget about me.

1044
01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.880
-Hope I'll hear from you soon.
-[man 14] Then. finally. I had him.

1045
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.280
[David] Dear Patsy. this place is a joke.

1046
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.560
So are the doctors.

1047
01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.920
They think they're clever.

1048
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.960
but they're as stupid
as the fools in here.

1049
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.240
Things are not looking too bad
for my trial.

1050
01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.680
I can't believe that I fooled
all the doctors.

1051
01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.840
"I can't believe that I have fooled
all the doctors."

1052
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.240
The jury looked at the correspondence
in its entirety.

1053
01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.880
Saw it as I saw it.
Saw it as the psychiatrist saw it.

1054
01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.680
There's absolutely nothing wrong with him.

1055
01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.560
Copeland was showed photographs
of these horrific injuries

1056
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.840
and all the misery and pain he'd caused.

1057
01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.400
and not once did he show
a sign of emotion.

1058
01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.840
But then when the prosecutor read out

1059
01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.920
that. um. the girl he wanted to marry

1060
01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.680
was actually a… an hairy-arsed bouncer
from Essex called Bernie.

1061
01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:24.200
you know. he put his head in his hands
and slumped in the dock.

1062
01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.120
You know. his-- his world ended.

1063
01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.840
[reporter 11]
David Copeland. the young fanatic

1064
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.320
who worshiped Adolf Hitler
and planted nail bombs across London.

1065
01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.800
is in Broadmoor tonight
starting six life sentences.

1066
01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.800
He was convicted of murdering three people
and injuring nearly 150 others

1067
01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.880
in a bombing campaign
that targeted Blacks and homosexuals.

1068
01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.960
The jury rejected his plea

1069
01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.400
that he wasn't responsible
for his actions.

1070
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.240
[crowd cheering and applauding]

1071
01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.320
[camera shutters clicking]

1072
01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.680
[dramatic music playing]

1073
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.920
[crowd cheering]

1074
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.720
[reporter 12] For two of the survivors.
a poignant moment outside the Old Bailey.

1075
01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.080
David Copeland has not achieved his aims
of fame and power.

1076
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:18.200
Today's verdict prove he--
proves he is a dangerous. pathetic nobody

1077
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.800
who is now where he belongs.

1078
01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.920
-Thanks. fellas.
-[reporter 13] Thanks.

1079
01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.560
[crowd cheering]

1080
01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.320
Everybody was saying. "Come on.
we'll go out for a drink" and "Yeah."

1081
01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:43.600
And I can remember thinking… [scoffs]
"Nothing to celebrate here. Really."

1082
01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.400
[man 18] Oh. beautiful.

1083
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.680
To new beginnings.

1084
01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.000
[man 16] I've always had this real
overwhelming sense of. um.

1085
01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.320
what a bloody waste.

1086
01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.760
What a waste of human life.

1087
01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.680
His included.

1088
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.320
'Cause he'll never get out.
he'll never be any use to anybody.

1089
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.200
And what he's done
to all these people. you know?

1090
01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.080
Hundreds and hundreds of people.

1091
01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.160
[somber music playing]

1092
01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:21.640
[Arthur] I wish…

1093
01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.680
I wish we'd been able to stop it.

1094
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.800
Just. like. stop those people
from being killed and injured.

1095
01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.680
[man 1] So. there's some sort of guilt
that exists. is there?

1096
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.360
[Arthur] Yeah.
Yeah. definitely. Definitely.

1097
01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.640
Definitely.

1098
01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.240
I think about that a lot.

1099
01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:49.560
I thought I'd got over it.
[laughing] And then it came back.

1100
01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.400
[sighs]

1101
01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.560
I. you know. well--

1102
01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.480
Joining the BNP. I wanted. like.
the excitement of. like. being a spy and…

1103
01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.280
all that. and. like.
taking on. like. the bad people.

1104
01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.480
But when something on that scale happened.

1105
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:13.360
I wish-- I wish we'd been able
to stop what happened sooner.

1106
01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.560
Yep.

1107
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.360
[somber music playing]

1108
01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:28.000
[man 12] Arthur was someone
who was motivated by doing something good.

1109
01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.560
At the time. there was a reward.
There was a reward put out by the police.

1110
01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.080
Seventy-thousand pounds
for his identification.

1111
01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.360
Arthur was never interested in a penny.

1112
01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.400
And even now. I mean--
There were some people in his family.

1113
01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.960
only on the 20th anniversary
of the London nail bombings

1114
01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.920
that some of his family found out
what-- what he had done.

1115
01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.080
That he wasn't a Nazi after all.

1116
01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.640
Arthur had been inside for 10 years.

1117
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.880
you know. week in. week out.
going to British National Party meetings.

1118
01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.120
being chased down the street
by anti-fascists.

1119
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.440
being attacked by anti-fascists.

1120
01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.920
going to concerts with Nazis.

1121
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.880
and he'd done all of this and--

1122
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.560
Of course. you know. he did far more
than just identify Copeland.

1123
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.200
He played a major role

1124
01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:26.760
in the British National Party not building
on their successes in East London.

1125
01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:32.200
Tyndall failed to take hold
across the country because of Arthur.

1126
01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.040
The police say that the BNP presence does
introduce an element of racial tension--

1127
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.560
Oh. "The police say.
the police say. the police say."

1128
01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.600
-So you don't believe them.
-No. we don't accept it at all.

1129
01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.040
And you don't accept the courts and
the convictions that your members have.

1130
01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.280
I've told you before.

1131
01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.600
our members have no greater proportion

1132
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.320
of convictions
than any other party members.

1133
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.200
Okay. Thanks very much.

1134
01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.960
Right. Get your stuff out of here
with the minimum delay.

1135
01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.200
You people are true to form.

1136
01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:09.680
You're exactly the way that. uh.
we've learned to expect. and…

1137
01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.480
[introspective cello music playing]

1138
01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.000
[activist] They're trying
to drive us apart.

1139
01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.440
and the message
we're giving them here today.

1140
01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.480
that it's the reverse effect.

1141
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.400
We're coming together!

1142
01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.120
-In a way you've never seen us before!
-[crowd cheering]

1143
01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.120
Let's march to fulfill this day!

1144
01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.680
I think that someone like Copeland.

1145
01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.040
someone trying to do what Copeland did.
will never succeed.

1146
01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.200
What gives me hope

1147
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.080
is that there are still more good people
than bad people.

1148
01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.160
And-- and the haters can never win.

1149
01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.720
In the long-- in the long term.
the haters can ne-- can never win.

1150
01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:16.200
And it must be… it must be horrible
to be consumed with hate.

1151
01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.240
You know?

1152
01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:22.520
Think about all the things you can't enjoy
'cause. you know. you're full of hate.

1153
01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.360
No. Today's Friday.
I'm gonna go home and have a beer.

1154
01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.120
[laughing]

1155
