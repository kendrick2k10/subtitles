I just wanna go home.

13
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.113
We. we have money.

14
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.963
- Money?

15
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.883
Don't fucking mention money to me.

17
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.348

- Your boyfriend? (chuckles)

19
00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:47.733
Your boyfriend's fucking useless.

(Lily whimpers)

34
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.442
It will hurt less. if you don't move.

35
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:36.893
All right? Yeah?

36
00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:43.980
I really don't want to have to gag you.

37
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.363
So please stay quiet. yeah?

38
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.780
Hey.

39
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.813
Look at me. Look at me.

40
00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:54.754
You're doing really well. Yeah?

41
00:02:54.754 --> 00:02:55.587
You are.

42
00:02:57.523 --> 00:02:58.356

48
00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:28.931

50
00:03:34.078 --> 00:03:35.245
Huh? So brave.

51
00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:38.399
Stupid.

52
00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:43.625
(Lily sobs)

53
00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:44.458
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.343
I never wanted to hurt anyone.

55
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.493
But it's my daughter.

56
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.673
I have to save my daughter.

57
00:03:53.673 --> 00:03:56.670
- Your daughter. Where is she?

58
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.380
We can help her.

59
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.373
We've got money.

60
00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:02.942
- "Money!"

61
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.433
Money will not help you.

62
00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:08.139

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.472
(Lily sobs)

64
00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:16.399
My daughter's... (sighs)

65
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.143
She died.

66
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.262
She drowned.

67
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.960
She's so lucky we found you. Lily.

68
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.830
It was fate.

69
00:04:27.488 --> 00:04:29.571
- [Lily] How can we help?

70
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.210
- My daughter's soul needs a body.

71
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.582
And a sacrifice.

72
00:04:41.427 --> 00:04:43.760
(Lily sobs)

73
00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:52.075
(suspenseful music continues)
(Lily pants)

74
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.153
It's time.

75
00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:58.170
(ominous music)

76
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.830
Lily. you and Santana must drink
the blood of the sacrifice.

77
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.753
So Santana's soul can breathe again.

78
00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:06.900
(Lily pants)

79
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.803
I am sorry.

80
00:05:14.512 --> 00:05:15.974
Look who it is.

81
00:05:15.974 --> 00:05:17.254
- Lily.

82
00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:18.592
- I'm sorry.

83
00:05:18.592 --> 00:05:21.521
(Lily sobs)

84
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:23.021
Please. just stop.

85
00:05:24.538 --> 00:05:29.288
(Lily sobs)
(tape tears)

86
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.523
(Lily sobs)

87
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.040
- Let blood be tasted
to take life's light.

88
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.350
The restless soul. restless no more.

89
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.293
(knife thuds)

90
00:05:46.293 --> 00:05:50.110
- No! (sobs)

91
00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.659
(Lily pants)

92
00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:56.577
- Lily. no!

93
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.870
Santana. please!

94
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.320
There might not be another.

95
00:06:10.492 --> 00:06:15.492
(Lily pants)
(hurried footsteps approach)

96
00:06:16.746 --> 00:06:19.163

(Lily screams)

100
00:07:22.594 --> 00:07:23.427
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:46.129
You were so beautiful.

102
00:07:58.696 --> 00:08:00.113
I'm sorry. I'm...

103
00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.865
(dark music)

104
00:08:12.727 --> 00:08:15.644

- [Reporter] Rescue teams in Indi...

108
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.830
- Many brave souls have entered.

109
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.750
only to be forever changed by the darkness

110
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.923
living in its walls.

111
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.430
With each step. we will
uncover its secrets.

112
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.603
once and for all.

113
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.923
Welcome to another
episode of "Laid to Rest".

114
00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:03.055
- Oh. Santana.

115
00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:06.259
I've found you.

116
00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:12.659
(brooding piano music)

117
00:10:20.189 --> 00:10:24.272
(brooding piano music continues)

118
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.950
- Whether it be on a clear
day or an unsettled night.

119
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.810
you can still feel the
presence of those doomed

120
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.500
civil war deserters. pleading
for forgiveness. possessed.

121
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.060
trapped here forever.

122
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.920
Until next time. I'm Jo Brooks.

123
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.017
and you were watching "Laid to Rest".

124
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.060
- And cut!

125
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.040
Hell yeah!

126
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.503
- That's a wrap. everybody.
Thank you so much!

127
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.013
Kisses all that stuff.

128
00:11:55.497 --> 00:11:56.643
- Uh. mic's still on.

129
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.590
- Let 'em listen.
(Sadie chuckles)

130
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.970
- Barf.

131
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.400
- [Hughie] Veronica.
Help us load up the car?

132
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.477
- Your arms are full. are they?

133
00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:10.227
(Sadie chuckles)

134
00:12:12.716 --> 00:12:15.090
Is this the only reason why
you have me on set. Michael?

135
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:15.990
Shooting during the day.

136
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.050
so you can have your light
tech carry your shit?

137
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.643
- We appreciate it. Veronica.

138
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.630
- Oh. you love being here with us. V.

139
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.190
- [Hughie] She loves
being here with one of us.

140
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.803
- Shush. Hughie. You little troublemaker.

141
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.810
- I repeat.

142
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.653
Barf.

143
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.800
- [Michael] Hey. Jo!

144
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.844
(Michael and Jo chuckle)

145
00:12:34.844 --> 00:12:36.753
- Woo!
- Give me that face. please!

146
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:38.733
Perfect.

147
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.430
- Um. actually. Michael.

148
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.380
I wanted to speak to you about something.

149
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.730
- Yeah. sure. What's up?

150
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.590
Great job. yet again. by the way.

151
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.980
- Thanks. It's just another haunted field.

152
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.712
We've done like so many
episodes like that.

153
00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:55.190
I want to do something
new. I want adventure.

154
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.023
(Michael chuckles)

155
00:12:56.023 --> 00:12:57.840
- Well. let me know when you find it.

156
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.090
But we can't afford to traipse around

157
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.340
and hope we land on a gold mine. Jo.

158
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.173
You know that.

159
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.336
Besides. we have a good time. don't we?

160
00:13:06.336 --> 00:13:07.620
(Jo sighs)

161
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.420
I love you guys.

162
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.683
It pays our bills.

163
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.164
Hughie and Sadie found each other. too.

164
00:13:14.164 --> 00:13:14.997
(Jo chuckles)

165
00:13:14.997 --> 00:13:16.466
Hughie!

166
00:13:16.466 --> 00:13:18.630
(Michael chuckles)

167
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.790
- I know. I know.

168
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.430
I just want to uncover
something no one has before.

169
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.023
I want something transcendent.

170
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.240
- Mm.

171
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.484
Well. I know that's code
for "passion project".

172
00:13:30.484 --> 00:13:31.826
(Jo chuckles)

173
00:13:31.826 --> 00:13:33.720
We can't afford those.

174
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.220
We do this for the market.

175
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.893
Look. I wish it were
different. Believe me.

176
00:13:39.762 --> 00:13:40.595
Yeah?
- Yeah. yeah.

177
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.653
- [Michael] Look.

178
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.930
You're the best there is.

179
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.724
If anyone can find transcendent. it's you.

180
00:13:49.724 --> 00:13:50.790
(Jo chuckles)

181
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.110
- Thanks.

182
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.603
- All right.
(Jo chuckles)

183
00:14:00.088 --> 00:14:02.737
- (gasps) Tori! What did I say before?

184
00:14:02.737 --> 00:14:05.250
- "A large cappuccino. oat
milk. no whipped cream.

185
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.770
Lots of chocolate"?
- About sneaking up on me.

186
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.380
- Oh. "We film the scares.
we don't make the scares."

187
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.663
- Exactly. But the cappuccino sounds good.

188
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.450
- Uh. I'm so sorry.

189
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.640
I just got all this fan email
and I was trying to work out

190
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.860
when to give it to you because
you always look so busy. and.

191
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.410
and great. by the way.

192
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.490
I think this will cheer you up.

193
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.400
because you also sometimes
look all depressed and...

194
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.078
I'm so sorry.

195
00:14:28.078 --> 00:14:30.478
I'm so sorry.
- Thanks. thanks.

196
00:14:30.478 --> 00:14:33.228
(car door slams)

197
00:14:38.198 --> 00:14:43.198
(car door slams)
(Jo sighs)

198
00:14:43.743 --> 00:14:45.993
(Jo sighs)

199
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.833
(Jo breathes deeply)

200
00:15:02.934 --> 00:15:05.184
(Jo sighs)

201
00:15:11.936 --> 00:15:14.186
(Jo moans)

202
00:15:22.744 --> 00:15:25.327
(gentle music)

203
00:15:31.496 --> 00:15:32.403
- [Julien] Dear Ms. Brooks.

204
00:15:32.403 --> 00:15:34.560
I am a great admirer of your work

205
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.360
and would like to invite you and your crew

206
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.750
to my private island. Isla de las Munecas.

207
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.670
to film a documentary.

208
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.220
I feel its story would be
of great interest to you.

209
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.960
People are afraid to visit here.

210
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.210
They say the island is cursed.

211
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.219
but I know the truth is
much deeper than that.

212
00:15:51.219 --> 00:15:54.150
I would like you to be
the one to do it justice.

213
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.405
I promise you. it is like
nowhere you have visited before.

214
00:15:57.405 --> 00:15:58.440
(Jo sighs)

215
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.330
Please get in touch at
your earliest convenience

216
00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.470
to make the arrangements.
if indeed you are ready.

217
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.660
Warmest regards. Julien.

218
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.650
- Michael!

219
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.500
Michael. I've got our next adventure.

220
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:11.636
Yeah.

221
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.593
- Hey.

222
00:16:28.836 --> 00:16:29.850
(Lily gasps)

223
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.072
Hey.

224
00:16:31.072 --> 00:16:31.905
It's all right.

225
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.471
It's okay.

226
00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:35.392
(Lily gasps)

227
00:16:35.392 --> 00:16:36.225
It's okay.

228
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:38.823
I found another one.

229
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.580
She's coming here.

230
00:16:45.054 --> 00:16:45.903
Her name is Jo.

231
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.930
She's everything I hoped she would be.

232
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.793
She's confident.

233
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.593
She's smart.

234
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.933
She's well respected.

235
00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:00.243
Successful.

236
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.560
She's perfect. (chuckles)

237
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.040
- Can I...

238
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.207
Can I go home?

239
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.098
Please?

240
00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:13.018
I won't...

241
00:17:13.018 --> 00:17:15.295
I won't tell anyone.

242
00:17:15.295 --> 00:17:19.752
Can you just like. you know... (sobs)

243
00:17:19.752 --> 00:17:20.586
- Hey.

244
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.411
Yeah.
(suspenseful music)

245
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:26.430
I'm gonna let you go.

246
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.520
You're free.

247
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.937
(Lily pants)

248
00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.491
There's nothing to be scared of anymore.

249
00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:36.158
(Lily sniffles)

250
00:17:43.363 --> 00:17:46.180
Up you get. up you get. up you get.

251
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.430
(suspenseful music continues)

252
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.013
(Julien sighs)

253
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.207
(neck snaps)

254
00:18:16.507 --> 00:18:19.090
(somber music)

255
00:18:29.503 --> 00:18:30.553
- [Al] I want double.

256
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:32.760
- We've already paid.

257
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.370
I've got the receipt here.

258
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.540
- I know.

259
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.790
- We've got a contract
to film on the island.

260
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.290
You were specifically
recommended to get us there.

261
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.280
- Trust me. I will get you there.

262
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.197
For double.

263
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:48.840
- We'll find someone else.

264
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.660
- You won't find anyone
else to take you there.

265
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.580
They all know about the island.

266
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.190
and all about the man that lives there.

267
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.580
He comes back here sometimes.
to claw through rubbish.

268
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.593
He takes old dolls with him!

269
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.360
A man. alone on an
island. collecting dolls?

270
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.830
What does he do with 'em? (scoffs)

271
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.753
Actually. I don't wanna know.

272
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.310
- Production will never go for this.

273
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.230
Fine. I guess I don't have a choice.

274
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.210
Supposed to be our best production ever.

275
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.520
- Thank you very much.

276
00:19:33.821 --> 00:19:36.404
(somber music)

277
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:03.371
(ropes creak)

278
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.357
You can get up to the that way.

279
00:20:18.357 --> 00:20:19.743
And good luck to ya.

280
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.770
I'll be back here. on the shore.

281
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.783
tomorrow at noon. to collect ya.

282
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.540
But know this.

283
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.793
If you're not there. I'm gone.

284
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.943
Oh.

285
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.123
By the way. I need payment
for tomorrow's journey.

286
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.140
- I already paid you for a return journey.

287
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.480
- Correct. (scoffs)

288
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.340
Rate's just gone up again.

289
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.893
I remembered just how
much I hate this place.

290
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.340
- This is ridiculous!

291
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.260
- Bank transfer's fine.

292
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.360
You've got my details.

293
00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.500
- Do you know what? Fine.

294
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.830
There.

295
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.330
- Pleasure doing business with ya.

296
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.163
- Yes.

297
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.497
We appreciate your...

298
00:21:10.416 --> 00:21:11.249
Your help.

299
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.370
- Intense fella.

300
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.930
- Hm.

301
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.130
- How can you be that wired.

302
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.274
when you literally own your own boat?

303
00:21:19.274 --> 00:21:20.610
(Jo chuckles)

304
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.525
- This place is so weird.

305
00:21:22.525 --> 00:21:23.358
(Jo sighs)

306
00:21:23.358 --> 00:21:25.857
- I'd call it "transcendent".

307
00:21:27.197 --> 00:21:28.110
(Michael chuckles)

308
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.390
- All right. Hughie. You should
start getting some shots.

309
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.610
Sadie. Veronica. we'll
unpack in the clearing.

310
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.043
Set things up for an intro. Yep?

311
00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:38.289
- Mm-hm.
- All right. let's go.

312
00:21:38.289 --> 00:21:40.789
(eerie music)

313
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.130
(faint giggling)

314
00:21:51.538 --> 00:21:53.705
- Fucking hate this place.

315
00:21:57.388 --> 00:22:00.888
(eerie music intensifies)

316
00:22:06.245 --> 00:22:08.995
(faint giggling)

317
00:22:14.016 --> 00:22:17.348
(faint giggling)

318
00:22:17.348 --> 00:22:18.181
Nope.

319
00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:22.856
(faint giggling)

320
00:22:25.407 --> 00:22:26.240
It's okay.

321
00:22:27.287 --> 00:22:28.996
I'm leaving now.

322
00:22:28.996 --> 00:22:31.174
And I won't be back.

323
00:22:31.174 --> 00:22:33.814
- [Santana] But I want you to stay!

324
00:22:33.814 --> 00:22:35.655
- Oh. fuck off!

325
00:22:35.655 --> 00:22:37.587
- [Santana] I'm gonna ripe your face off.

326
00:22:37.587 --> 00:22:39.613
(intense music)

327
00:22:39.613 --> 00:22:43.920
- The history of Isla de las
Munecas. "The Island of Dolls".

328
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.410
has fascinated many for years.

329
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.520
His daughter's death

330
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.490
has sparked the island sole inhabitants.

331
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.070
Julien places his daughter's doll

332
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.840
near the site of her death.

333
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.503
His heart aches. willing to
do anything to get her back.

334
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.740
As the years have gone by.

335
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.650
he's placed more and more
dolls by the site of her death.

336
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:09.120
hoping against hopelessness
that one day. she will return.

337
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.880
But what of the curse they
speak of. of the island?

338
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.460
For the first time. cameras
have been given exclusive access

339
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.253
onto the island to find out more.

340
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.070
- And...

341
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.120
Cut.

342
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.070
All right. perfect.

343
00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:27.813
All right. let's get
some shots of the doll.

344
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:29.603
Yeah?

345
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.530
- Sure.
- When you're ready.

346
00:23:38.953 --> 00:23:41.640
(leaves rustle)

347
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.960
Hughie. what's up?

348
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.019
(eerie music)

349
00:23:44.019 --> 00:23:45.690
(faint giggling)

350
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.523
Mate.

351
00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.190
That's a good tape and we need the shot.

352
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.363
What's going on?

353
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.970
- Babe. are you okay?

354
00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.130
- I saw something move behind Jo.

355
00:24:08.556 --> 00:24:11.889
(eerie music continues)

356
00:24:15.458 --> 00:24:16.830
- I've been feeling a breeze behind me.

357
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.810
It was probably just that.

358
00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.550
Look. relax. (sighs)

359
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.200
Hughie. we need to get these
shots while its daytime.

360
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.593
- It's not the wind.

361
00:24:27.172 --> 00:24:28.339
It's its head.

362
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.033
It's like it's watching me.

363
00:24:33.251 --> 00:24:36.539
- (chuckles) What?
(Veronica chuckles)

364
00:24:36.539 --> 00:24:38.010
- (chuckles) Look at him!

365
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.620
He's terrified! (snickers)

366
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.270
- All right. look. Hughie.

367
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:45.090
You really need to pull
yourself together. mate.

368
00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:46.390
Are you ready to go again?

369
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.590
- I have a phobia of dolls.

370
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:53.423
- Sorry?

371
00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:58.170
- I have a phobia of dolls. okay?

372
00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.082
It's called pediophobia.

373
00:25:00.082 --> 00:25:01.299
- "Pedo"?

374
00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:02.842
- No. not "Pedo."

375
00:25:02.842 --> 00:25:04.500
"Pedio."

376
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.218
It's legit. I...

377
00:25:06.218 --> 00:25:07.118
They freak me out.

378
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.690
Oh. God. I can't be here. I've gotta go.

379
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:10.787
- Babe. why didn't you tell me?

380
00:25:10.787 --> 00:25:13.710
- Because it's so fuckin' funny.

381
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.420
So what's the story. then. Hughie?

382
00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.100
Where did Action Man touch you?

383
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:17.933
- V.

384
00:25:19.804 --> 00:25:20.940
(Jo sighs)

385
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.820
- Look. Hughie. you're one
of the best cameramen I know.

386
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.190
Think about all the haunted
fields we've been to.

387
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.053
We're all together. We'll be fine.

388
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.010
They're just dolls.
They're just ornaments!

389
00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.780
- Haunted ornaments.

390
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.090
- All right!
(Veronica giggles)

391
00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:37.250
Look. let's just...

392
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.193
Let's take a moment. shall we?

393
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.060
It's been a long day
already. We'll just...

394
00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.490
We'll put ourselves together.
get the opening shot.

395
00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.553
and then find this Julien character. yeah?

396
00:25:51.453 --> 00:25:52.903
- Yep. Yep. you good. Hughie?

397
00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.260
- Let's take a walk.

398
00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.600
- I think we should...

399
00:26:10.174 --> 00:26:15.174
(faint giggling)
(dark music)

400
00:26:16.181 --> 00:26:17.073
- Hughie's right. you know.

401
00:26:17.073 --> 00:26:19.740
I think I saw it move. too.

402
00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.150
But don't worry.

403
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.083
I'll protect ya.

404
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.753
You stick with me. okay?

405
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.233
- Okay.

406
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.720
Looks like there's a clearing up ahead.

407
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.800
I'm gonna check it out.

408
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.920
Getting a little bit
claustrophobic around here.

409
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.993
- Cool. I'll come with you.

410
00:26:39.655 --> 00:26:42.905
(dark music continues)

411
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.380
Oh. boy.

412
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.630
I didn't think anyone
would actually be here.

413
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.940
- Why wouldn't there be?

414
00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.810
- Who would wanna live here?

415
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.530
- Well. that Julien guy. I guess

416
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.250
- The doll man.

417
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.470
Can't wait to meet the fella.

418
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.053
- He wrote to Jo. He sounded kinda nice.

419
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.350
- Jo has kind of

420
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.770
intense fans.

421
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.110
So I'm glad she didn't
try and come here alone.

422
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.553
She can be quite naive.

423
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.910
Guys?

424
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.593
Creepy old house. right here!

425
00:27:30.118 --> 00:27:31.713
- (chuckles) Whoa.

426
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.910
- [Veronica] Right?

427
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.410
- I think it looks kinda cute.

428
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.900
- This

429
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.105
is gold.

430
00:27:44.105 --> 00:27:44.938
(fingers click)

431
00:27:44.938 --> 00:27:47.160
Okay. Change of plan.

432
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.720
Get ready for the next shot. Jo.

433
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.470
We'll get you right up to the door.

434
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.353
- So. the guy who sent
the letter. lives here?

435
00:27:57.697 --> 00:27:59.297
I'm sure he's normal.
- Hughie?

436
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.190
Our viewers don't want normal.

437
00:28:03.026 --> 00:28:05.943
(Michael chuckles)

438
00:28:12.197 --> 00:28:14.697
(door creaks)

439
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.683
- Absolutely not.

440
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.780
- Whoa.

441
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.613
- Hughie?

442
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.162
- Get your camera going. right now.

443
00:28:27.162 --> 00:28:28.830
- I knew you were gonna say that.

444
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.330
- You want your comfort dolly. Hughie?

445
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.580
- Shut up. V.

446
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.830
(Jo sighs)

447
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.993
- Hello?

448
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.303
Julien?

449
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.313
It's Jo. I'm here with the camera crew.

450
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.803
Michael. this. this is
giving me really bad vibes.

451
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.070
- Perfect. Use it.

452
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.953
Imagine how the viewers are gonna feel.

453
00:28:56.465 --> 00:29:01.465
(Jo sighs)
(suspenseful music)

454
00:29:03.233 --> 00:29:05.733
(door creaks)

455
00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.593
- Okay?

456
00:29:10.451 --> 00:29:12.951
(eerie tones)

457
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.110
Oh. God! Gross!

458
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:22.050
If this guy offers to feed
us too. I don't want it.

459
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.010
- Give the guy a break.

460
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.830
I doubt he has many visitors. you know?

461
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.630
- Not willing ones. anyways.

462
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:28.983
Proper murderer vibes.

463
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.140
- It's...

464
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.700
Quaint.

465
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.533
- Perfect.

466
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.330
Remind me of that first haunted
house doc we did. (chuckles)

467
00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:38.760
- (chuckles) Oh. is that
the one where Hughie

468
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.470
screamed at his own reflection?

469
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.570
- Yeah. I screamed 'cause
I thought it was you.

470
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.820
- You wish.
- All right. guys. please.

471
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.710
- How many haunted houses have you done?

472
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.060
- We did eight in season one.

473
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.100
but now we keep it to two every season.

474
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.320
You know. otherwise. it gets a bit samey.

475
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.870
- So. to answer your question. Tori. none.

476
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.910
None of them have been actually haunted.

477
00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:58.260
- Uh. they were.

478
00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.210
I've recorded so much weird breathing.

479
00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.360
- Because Hughie had to walk
up so many flights of stairs.

480
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.500
- What about the orbs?

481
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.140
- Oh. you mean the
out-of-focus dust particles?

482
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.673
- Guys. please. Come on.

483
00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.240
- Yeah. Michael. I think I'm
ready to go. Should we go?

484
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.770
- Cool.
- Yeah.

485
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:15.213
- You good. Hughie?
- Sure.

486
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.271
- You get the take. We move on. right?

487
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:20.520
- Okay. yeah. yeah.
- Right.

488
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.353
- Okay.

489
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.730
Everyone set?

490
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:24.563
- Sadie?

491
00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.320
Hughie?

492
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.153
- [Hughie] Sure.

493
00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:32.580
- And...

494
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.810
Action.

495
00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.760
- I'm Jo Brooks and we are "Laid to Rest".

496
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.700
standing here in the
island. Isla de las Munecas.

497
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.440
There is an atmosphere here of loss.

498
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.670
and what might have been.

499
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.250
Julien. living here in
the island's only house.

500
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.960
surrounded by memories of his daughter.

501
00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.990
and in the hope that.
one day. she will return.

502
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.240
Julien has given us exclusive
access to the island.

503
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.950
and I cannot wait to
find out what happened

504
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.360
on that fateful day.

505
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.850
and why this island elicits so much fear.

506
00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.620
- [Michael] Hughie. We need this.

507
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.050
Your job is on the line here. mate.

508
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:01.883
Hughie!

509
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.063
Hughie!

510
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:07.770
- [Veronica] Sick.

511
00:31:10.051 --> 00:31:13.301
(Jo clears her throat)

512
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.200
- [Jo] Should we. um. should we continue?

513
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.613
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm. yep.

514
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.223
- Everyone set?

515
00:31:22.835 --> 00:31:23.668
And...

516
00:31:24.573 --> 00:31:25.406
Action.

517
00:31:26.763 --> 00:31:28.350
(tarp rustles)
(Sadie screams)

518
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:31.380
- You made it!
(ominous music)

519
00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.383
Welcome to Isla de las Munecas!

520
00:31:45.213 --> 00:31:47.525
(fire crackles)

521
00:31:47.525 --> 00:31:49.463
I hope you all brought lighters with you.

522
00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.290
Gets a bit chilly out here at night.

523
00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.310
- I brought my onesie.

524
00:31:57.593 --> 00:32:00.030
- We can't thank you
enough for this. Julien.

525
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.913
We're all honored to share your story.

526
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.882
- I'm delighted to have you here.

527
00:32:05.882 --> 00:32:06.799
All of you.

528
00:32:08.535 --> 00:32:11.370
(crow caws)

529
00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:12.780
- Julien.

530
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.913
You've got an interesting place.

531
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.293
- You're welcome. (chuckles)

532
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.510
- The soup was incredible. though.

533
00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.530
Sumac?

534
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:29.400
- Yeah. Well tasted. (chuckles)

535
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.920
- Julien. I just wondered if
I could ask some questions

536
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.003
with the camera?

537
00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.330
- Of course. That's
why you're here. right?

538
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.470
(Jo chuckles)

539
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.320
- When I received your letter.
I was (sighs) thrilled.

540
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.300
I mean. we've all been waiting
for somewhere like this

541
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.983
for such a long time.

542
00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.170
- Oh. there is nowhere like this.

543
00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.070
- Correct.

544
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.903
- Shush.

545
00:32:54.787 --> 00:32:55.620
(melancholy music)

546
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.170
When I first started collecting
the dolls for Santana.

547
00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.710
I would get visitors
from the mainland often.

548
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.650
I think. to begin with.
it was out of sympathy.

549
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.240
But then after a while.

550
00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.140
it felt like they were laughing at me.

551
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.890
So I stopped sanctioning their boats.

552
00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.723
I felt like it was just
better to be on my own.

553
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.333
But now I think people
should know the truth.

554
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.280
- Um...

555
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.900
What is the truth?

556
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.273
I mean. we've heard rumors about a curse.

557
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.600
- If the island is cursed by
anything. it is cursed by love.

558
00:33:41.223 --> 00:33:44.013
- Oh. my God. That's beautiful.

559
00:33:44.013 --> 00:33:45.363
- Love for Santana?

560
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.377
Uh...

561
00:33:49.377 --> 00:33:53.118
We're all really sorry about
what happened to your daughter.

562
00:33:53.118 --> 00:33:56.190
(sighs) It must be hard.
hearing what people say.

563
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:57.333
- Santana is not dead.

564
00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:01.620
- She...

565
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:02.453
She's not?

566
00:34:03.638 --> 00:34:04.471
- No.

567
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.610
Her spirit is here on the island.

568
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:09.443
- But not

569
00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:11.583
her body?

570
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.710
- Santana's spirit is what matters.

571
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.763
Her body is gone.

572
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.800
but she still helps
give life to the island.

573
00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:26.330
She knew this would
bring me great comfort.

574
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.933
- [Jo] And where is Santana now?

575
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.976
- The dolls were my tribute to her.

576
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.639
I left her favorite doll
near where she died and.

577
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.672
and over the years. I've just added more.

578
00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:51.063
Now they are her vessels.

579
00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:56.270
They are everywhere.

580
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:57.453
So she can watch.

581
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.630
She's watching us. right now.

582
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:04.703
Waiting.

583
00:35:07.931 --> 00:35:10.161
(phone thuds)

584
00:35:10.161 --> 00:35:11.713
- Sorry.

585
00:35:11.713 --> 00:35:12.546
Sorry.

586
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.950
- Look. Do you have
everything you need for now?

587
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.500
'Cause I'm feeling a little bit tired.

588
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.563
Just reliving it all. It kinda
takes all of my energy away.

589
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.460
- Yes. Yes. of course.

590
00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.960
Um...

591
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:28.833
That was perfect.

592
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.860
Thank you so much. Julien.

593
00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.610
- Are you sure you're
okay camping out here?

594
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.180
I. I have some room inside.

595
00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.480
- [Michael] No. that's kind.
I think. I think we're fine.

596
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.860
- Jo?

597
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.287
- Oh. uh...

598
00:35:44.287 --> 00:35:45.480
(Jo chuckles)

599
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.030
Thank you. um. but I can't.

600
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.340
We've. we've got shots to
film around here tonight.

601
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.700
and whatnot and you know.
we'll be back in the morning.

602
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.440
Of course. (chuckles)

603
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.313
- As you wish.

604
00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.209
Goodnight. everyone.

605
00:35:59.209 --> 00:36:00.509
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight!

606
00:36:03.662 --> 00:36:07.162
(Michael breathes deeply)

607
00:36:10.581 --> 00:36:11.664
- Oh. my God.

608
00:36:12.738 --> 00:36:14.250
(Veronica chuckles)

609
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.420
That was perfect.

610
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.880
- He's a fucking creep! (chuckles)

611
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.450
- Aw. I actually. I
think he's quite broken.

612
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:22.860
And I really hope we can tell the story.

613
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.753
the way he'd like. guys.

614
00:36:23.753 --> 00:36:26.152
- I think we know what he would like. hon.

615
00:36:26.152 --> 00:36:29.010
(Jo chuckles)

616
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.410
- All right. look. We've got
some good footage today. guys.

617
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:32.940
Tomorrow's a big day.

618
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.610
We'll get the rest of
Julien's story in the morning.

619
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.630
We'll get a few more bits.

620
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.730
and we're back to the boat for noon.

621
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.940
Tonight. we need some creepy
shot from where the girl died.

622
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.910
and some decent sound from the forest.

623
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.350
- Santana.

624
00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:47.280
- Sorry?

625
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.513
- Her name was Santana.

626
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.730
- Right.

627
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:51.960
Santana. Sorry.

628
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.793
Where Santana died.

629
00:36:52.793 --> 00:36:54.753
- I thought she didn't die?

630
00:36:56.714 --> 00:37:00.297
(ominous orchestral music)

631
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.767
- I'll record in the forest.

632
00:37:03.767 --> 00:37:05.760
I love all the different
noises. (chuckles)

633
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.377
- Yeah. I'll come with you.

634
00:37:07.377 --> 00:37:10.440
- Uh. no. Hughie. We
need you for these shots.

635
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.620
We can't be up here all
night. We've gotta rest up.

636
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.090
We're up at dawn.

637
00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:16.690
- I can film where Santana died.

638
00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.280
I want to be a cinematographer. one day.

639
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.950
I've got a good eye. I can do it.

640
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.530
- She's taken good
establishing shots for me.

641
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:26.670
- Okay. fine.

642
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:28.200
- I'll go with her.

643
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.910
She might get lost.

644
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.160
You know what she's like.

645
00:37:33.107 --> 00:37:36.529
(ominous orchestral music)

646
00:37:36.529 --> 00:37:40.276
- All right. Don't be too long. everyone.

647
00:37:40.276 --> 00:37:41.868
Have you got time to go over the script?

648
00:37:41.868 --> 00:37:42.951
- Yeah. sure.

649
00:37:52.828 --> 00:37:55.245
(dark music)

650
00:37:58.557 --> 00:38:01.560
- Are you scared. baby boy? (chuckles)

651
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.080
- It's a phobia. I can't help it.

652
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:04.913
- I'm sorry.

653
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.880
I wish you would've told
me. We wouldn't have come.

654
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.300
- How am I supposed to know
that de las Maracas meant dolls?

655
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.047
- Well. it doesn't.

656
00:38:14.047 --> 00:38:17.370
"Maracas." (chuckles)

657
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.720
- That's cute.

658
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.553
You're cute.

659
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.373
Come on.

660
00:38:44.367 --> 00:38:47.043
- Are you sure You don't
need me to protect you?

661
00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:00.630
- They're just dolls.

662
00:39:02.922 --> 00:39:04.511
- Aww.

663
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:09.128
Me hero. (giggles)

664
00:39:14.133 --> 00:39:15.363
- Poor Santana.

665
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.983
This is where they last
saw her alive. It's so sad.

666
00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:23.130
- Well. someone's done their research.

667
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:24.580
- I just wanna do a good job.

668
00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.060
- Jo mentioned it was
one doll to begin with.

669
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.620
Reckon this is it.

670
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.170
- This is it.

671
00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:38.003
- [Veronica] Hm.

672
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.220
Freaky.

673
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.560
It's in pretty good nick. though.

674
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.530
- It was Santana's. It
was very special to her.

675
00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.430
I think it's really nice that
Julien left it here for her.

676
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:55.200
- Do you reckon that
guy even had a daughter?

677
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.160
He's a bit off. isn't he?

678
00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.260
Makes a mean soup. though.

679
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.850
- Well. of course she was real.

680
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.100
You don't lie about something like that.

681
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.813
He's heartbroken. You can tell.

682
00:40:08.013 --> 00:40:11.930
(suspenseful orchestral music)

683
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.240
- What's your story then. Tori?

684
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.040
- [Tori] My story?

685
00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.510
- Yeah.

686
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.850
You rock up as an intern.
you've got this whole

687
00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.190
ditsy-but-in-control thing going on.

688
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:27.640
but I know nothing about you.

689
00:40:31.187 --> 00:40:33.440
- I. I'm sorry. I'm really not interested.

690
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.030
- Excuse me?

691
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:38.396
- [Tori] I'm just here to do my job.

692
00:40:38.396 --> 00:40:40.770
- (chuckles) Oh. yeah?

693
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.810
You suddenly wanna
become a cinematographer.

694
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:44.910
as soon as there was a chance to be alone?

695
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.033
- I do want to be a cinematographer.

696
00:40:59.582 --> 00:41:01.350
(leaves rustle)

697
00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:02.183
Veronica!

698
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.490
I'm not done here! Where are you going?

699
00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:06.790
(ominous music)
Veronica!

700
00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:23.529
(leaves rustle)
- What was that?

701
00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.673
- Stop.

702
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.930
Normal rustling to be
found in any normal forest?

703
00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:33.270
- [Sadie] No. No. it was something else.

704
00:41:35.603 --> 00:41:39.451
(leaves rustle)
(distant giggling)

705
00:41:39.451 --> 00:41:41.235
- Okay. I heard that.

706
00:41:41.235 --> 00:41:42.985
- Hughie. I'm scared.

707
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.350
- Who's out there?

708
00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:47.193
Veronica?

709
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.071
Stop being such a weird bitch.

710
00:41:51.071 --> 00:41:53.258
(leaves rustle)

711
00:41:53.258 --> 00:41:56.175
(distant giggling)

712
00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.217
- I think we should go.

713
00:41:59.217 --> 00:42:01.156
- No. no. no. no. We're
not going anywhere.

714
00:42:01.156 --> 00:42:02.310
- Hughie!

715
00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:04.710
- This cheesy giggling is just Veronica.

716
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:07.493
Even though I've never heard
her laugh. a day in my life!

717
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.733
The viewers will eat this shit up.

718
00:42:10.733 --> 00:42:13.650
(distant giggling)

719
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.220
Yeah. Ha ha!

720
00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.410
Okay. we know it's you. Veronica.

721
00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:25.230
Just give us something.
so we can go back to camp.

722
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.103
It's chilly.

723
00:42:27.569 --> 00:42:29.430
(distant giggling)

724
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.870
- Hughie. please.

725
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.630
- Oh. give it up. V. Just give
us a little lighting trick!

726
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:35.580
Whatever it is you're planning.

727
00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.380
Is Michael there. too?

728
00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.553
Was this all a setup?

729
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.870
Do you reckon this was all a setup?

730
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:44.580
- I reckon we should go.

731
00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:45.510
- Okay. fine.

732
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.310
Gone quiet now. anyway. She gave up.

733
00:42:49.606 --> 00:42:52.770
(ominous orchestral music)

734
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.123
- Were those here before?

735
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:57.680
- Yeah. um...

736
00:42:59.117 --> 00:43:00.367
Okay. let's go.

737
00:43:01.777 --> 00:43:06.777
(Sadie screams)
(intense ominous music)

738
00:43:06.822 --> 00:43:09.392
- [Santana] You're so pretty.

739
00:43:09.392 --> 00:43:12.059
(Sadie screams)

740
00:43:15.971 --> 00:43:18.638
(fire crackles)

741
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.120
- Veronica! You scared me.

742
00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.410
- And what?

743
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.150
- What's wrong with you. and where's Tori?

744
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:28.150
- How should I know?

745
00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.930
- Okay.

746
00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:31.980
- Michael!

747
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.090
Michael!

748
00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:35.550
If you're gonna snore. you're
sleeping in Julien's house.

749
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:36.843
with the creepy dolls!

750
00:43:37.847 --> 00:43:40.180
(tent zips)

751
00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:45.987
(Jo sighs)

752
00:43:45.987 --> 00:43:49.080
- (gasps) Tori! What did I say before?

753
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.580
- I'm so sorry. "We film the scares"-

754
00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.418
- Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just...

755
00:43:53.418 --> 00:43:55.650
I'm anxious with all this
work stuff. you know?

756
00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:58.413
- Yeah. of course.
(Jo sighs)

757
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.010
- Um. anyway. did you get
what we needed out there?

758
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.753
- Sure did.
- Great. great.

759
00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.330
- You know. I think it's really great.

760
00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:07.950
It's very creepy over there

761
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:10.110
and we found Santana's
doll and everything.

762
00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:12.300
- Oh. cool. Maybe we
can film that tomorrow.

763
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.133
- Yeah. cool.

764
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:15.443
- Great.

765
00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:21.690
Ah. Hughie's camera.

766
00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.180
You can just put that over
there with his things.

767
00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.880
- Oh. they're not back yet?
- No.

768
00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:32.880
- You know. I really admire you.

769
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.590
You make everything so accessible.

770
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:37.563
and whenever you speak to
anyone. you do it with dignity.

771
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.625
You're the reason I wanted
this internship so badly.

772
00:44:41.625 --> 00:44:44.250
(Jo chuckles)

773
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.520
- Yeah. you've been a great
addition to the team. too.

774
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.783
Keep up a good work.

775
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.421
- Do you think Hughie would
let me take some more shots?

776
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:56.471
- (sighs) He's precious about his camera.

777
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:59.850
- Yeah. Maybe I'll just wait up for him.

778
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:00.683
- I wouldn't.

779
00:45:00.683 --> 00:45:03.780
I dread to think what he's
even doing out there. and.

780
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.870
you know. um. maybe ask him tomorrow.

781
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.130
- Yeah.

782
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:08.970
Yeah.

783
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:09.803
So...

784
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.743
So. should we just gang
out for a little bit?

785
00:45:15.999 --> 00:45:17.190
(Jo sighs)

786
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:20.140
- You know. I really have to
get on with these notes. Tori.

787
00:45:21.582 --> 00:45:22.415
Goodnight.

788
00:45:30.043 --> 00:45:32.460
(dark music)

789
00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:43.540
(distant giggling)
(Jo pants)

790
00:45:44.428 --> 00:45:45.638
- [Jo] Hello?

791
00:45:45.638 --> 00:45:47.888
(Jo pants)

792
00:45:51.127 --> 00:45:54.890
(Jo pants)
(dark music continues)

793
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.807
(distant giggling)

794
00:46:02.298 --> 00:46:05.215
(distant giggling)

795
00:46:10.808 --> 00:46:12.698
(Jo pants)

796
00:46:12.698 --> 00:46:15.437
(distant giggling)

797
00:46:15.437 --> 00:46:16.767
Hello?

798
00:46:16.767 --> 00:46:19.017
(Jo pants)

799
00:46:23.087 --> 00:46:28.087
(Jo pants)
(dark music swells)

800
00:46:47.418 --> 00:46:50.085
(doll clatters)

801
00:46:50.927 --> 00:46:51.760
Shit.

802
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.270
- Jo.
(Jo gasps)

803
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:58.563
Everything okay?

804
00:46:58.563 --> 00:47:02.430
- Yeah. I'm so sorry
that your doll scared me.

805
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.620
- [Julien] Yeah. they have
a tendency to do that.

806
00:47:05.882 --> 00:47:08.382
(Jo chuckles)

807
00:47:09.792 --> 00:47:11.542
Do you wanna come in?

808
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.260
- I mean. sure.

809
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.300
I just. I'm not sure if
you'd rather be alone.

810
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.750
and I know we said we'd
come back in the morning.

811
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:21.060
- [Julien] It's no trouble.

812
00:47:21.994 --> 00:47:23.394
I'll be glad of the company.

813
00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:29.184
- Okay. (chuckles)

814
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:37.110
- [Julien] I can't remember the last time

815
00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:39.210
I had someone here for tea.

816
00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:41.043
- Well. I'm glad to be of service.

817
00:47:43.996 --> 00:47:46.579
(Julien sighs)

818
00:47:54.819 --> 00:47:56.583
- (sighs) Where did you find that?

819
00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.685
- Oh. I just found it outside.
Is it your daughter's?

820
00:48:02.685 --> 00:48:03.518
- Yeah.

821
00:48:05.496 --> 00:48:07.746
- "Dear Lily. love Johnny"?

822
00:48:12.822 --> 00:48:14.294
(Julien sighs)

823
00:48:14.294 --> 00:48:15.756
- Oh. yeah. (chuckles)

824
00:48:15.756 --> 00:48:17.694
I remember now.

825
00:48:17.694 --> 00:48:20.460
It was Santana's friend. Lily's.

826
00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.853
She must've dropped it.
the last time she was here.

827
00:48:23.886 --> 00:48:26.333
They used to play outside
together. all the time.

828
00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.433
- And Johnny?

829
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:33.023
- Yeah.

830
00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:34.973
And Johnny.

831
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.764
Little Johnny.

832
00:48:37.764 --> 00:48:38.854
(Jo chuckles)

833
00:48:38.854 --> 00:48:40.204
He had such a crush on her.

834
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:48.270
- I know it's not the same
thing. but. I live alone too.

835
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:51.393
So. I know what it's like to be alone.

836
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:55.503
Actually. uh. I just throw
myself into work. you know?

837
00:48:56.739 --> 00:48:58.620
I don't really have any family.

838
00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.030
Well. no. the crew. (chuckles)

839
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.036
They're like my family. you know?

840
00:49:02.036 --> 00:49:05.523
I don't think they realize
just how much they mean to me.

841
00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:08.583
- Family is important.

842
00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.030
And you know. the best thing about family

843
00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.070
is that you can always make your own.

844
00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:20.673
They don't have to be blood. (chuckles)

845
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.970
You know. there is a difference

846
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.863
between being alone and feeling lonely.

847
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:32.703
I don't feel lonely.

848
00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.613
I feel Santana's spirit
all around me. every day.

849
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:42.363
I feel her warmth.

850
00:49:43.798 --> 00:49:45.120
- [Jo] That's... (chuckles)

851
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:45.993
That's nice.

852
00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.363
- Look. I know you'd rather
stay outside with your friends.

853
00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:00.663
but I have some extra blankets
you can take. if you like.

854
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:03.393
- That'd be lovely. Thank you.

855
00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:15.163
(clock ticks rhythmically)

856
00:50:43.009 --> 00:50:46.092
(footsteps approach)

857
00:50:47.801 --> 00:50:50.301
(Jo chuckles)

858
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:59.190
- We used to sit outside and
wrap ourselves in this blanket.

859
00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:02.320
It was Santana's favorite.

860
00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:06.003
It's lovely and warm.

861
00:51:06.003 --> 00:51:08.503
(Jo chuckles)

862
00:51:18.803 --> 00:51:21.386
(chair creaks)

863
00:51:23.603 --> 00:51:24.960
(Jo exhales sharply)

864
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:28.530
- Um. I wouldn't. without your
permission. of course. but.

865
00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:32.400
I just wondered if you
had any photos of Santana.

866
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.940
You know. it brings this
story sort of more to life.

867
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.040
seeing there's a face.

868
00:51:38.151 --> 00:51:39.318
You know?
- Mm.

869
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:43.103
- I have many.

870
00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.420
I used to look at them. every day.

871
00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.893
But it was too painful to see her face.

872
00:51:53.003 --> 00:51:56.550
- Yeah. I understand. (chuckles)

873
00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:57.850
- I have some locked away.

874
00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:02.850
It's getting easier to think
about looking at them again.

875
00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:05.190
- You. you mentioned before that Santana.

876
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:07.053
you know. sees through dolls.

877
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:10.463
- What do you want to know?

878
00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:12.293
- Um...

879
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.513
Like...

880
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:16.830
What's she looking for?

881
00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:17.663
- Not what.

882
00:52:19.405 --> 00:52:20.581
Who.

883
00:52:20.581 --> 00:52:25.128
- She's looking for someone?
(gentle music)

884
00:52:25.128 --> 00:52:28.530
- Santana was a very curious girl.

885
00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:29.970
She liked to sit in the forest and watch.

886
00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:31.371
when we would have visitors.

887
00:52:31.371 --> 00:52:33.210
(both chuckle)

888
00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:36.633
She used to sit there for
hours. and just stare.

889
00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.220
Her and her sister would
stay out there for hours.

890
00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.123
- Her sister?

891
00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:45.075
Wait. (chuckles)

892
00:52:45.075 --> 00:52:46.158
Is she alive?

893
00:52:47.193 --> 00:52:49.053
Does she live here?

894
00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.090
How old is she?

895
00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:52.809
- Enough!
(plates clang)

896
00:52:52.809 --> 00:52:57.809
(suspenseful music)
(clock ticks rhythmically)

897
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.533
I'm sorry. Jo.

898
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.190
This is all very emotional.

899
00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:11.610
- It's okay. um. I should get going.

900
00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:14.320
because we have a really early
start in the morning and-

901
00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.153
- You know I'd never hurt you. Jo.

902
00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:19.591
(Jo chuckles)

903
00:53:19.591 --> 00:53:24.591
- Thanks for tea. Julien. (chuckles)

904
00:53:26.023 --> 00:53:30.231
- Don't forget this.
(Jo chuckles)

905
00:53:30.231 --> 00:53:31.729
- Goodnight.

906
00:53:31.729 --> 00:53:32.979
- Sweet dreams.

907
00:53:45.299 --> 00:53:50.299
(distant giggling)
(suspenseful music continues)

908
00:53:51.749 --> 00:53:54.666
(distant giggling)

909
00:54:00.859 --> 00:54:03.776
(distant giggling)

910
00:54:08.557 --> 00:54:11.474
(distant giggling)

911
00:54:15.518 --> 00:54:18.851
(intense ominous music)

912
00:54:19.699 --> 00:54:20.532
- Santana?

913
00:54:23.201 --> 00:54:24.542
(Jo pants)

914
00:54:24.542 --> 00:54:26.901
- Will you be my doll. Jo?

915
00:54:26.901 --> 00:54:29.151
(Jo gasps)

916
00:54:37.077 --> 00:54:38.663
- [Veronica] You all right. Michael?

917
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.853
What's that face for?

918
00:54:44.558 --> 00:54:46.677
Are you grumpy?
(Michael sighs)

919
00:54:46.677 --> 00:54:48.870
- [Michael] I'm the
director. I have to be grumpy

920
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:51.423
- [Jo] Morning. guys.

921
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.830
- We need to be getting
those shots up at the house.

922
00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:56.790
right now.

923
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:59.670
Boat is coming in two
hours. I can't believe this.

924
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:03.330
- Hughie and Sadie are
still sleeping. or...

925
00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:04.710
- They didn't come back in last night.

926
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:05.550
- [Jo] What?

927
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:07.650
- You didn't see them. either?

928
00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:11.338
- No. I was writing some notes
and I went straight to bed.

929
00:55:11.338 --> 00:55:14.670
- I knew it was a bad idea
to keep hiring them both.

930
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:17.400
Ever since they got together.
they've been wandering off.

931
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.020
every five minutes. canoodling.

932
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:22.650
- No. this isn't like them. We
should go and look for them.

933
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:24.690
- No. no. We're not wasting any more time.

934
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:25.620
Tori.

935
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.450
Tori. you've got the camera there. right?

936
00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:28.283
- Yeah.

937
00:55:28.283 --> 00:55:29.760
- [Michael] And how do you
feel about taking over?

938
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.660
- I'd love it.

939
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.250
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
- All right.

940
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:33.930
- What about sound?

941
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:37.561
I know I torture Hughie and
Sadie. but they are the best.

942
00:55:37.561 --> 00:55:39.840
- (sighs) And they could be in trouble.

943
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.532
- Maybe Action Man came back for Hughie?

944
00:55:42.532 --> 00:55:45.030
- (sighs) We don't know what's out there.

945
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.050
- Please. they'll be fine.

946
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:47.370
They probably got busy in the woods

947
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:49.350
and then fall asleep or something.

948
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:53.340
I mean. Hughie definitely
has. but poor Sadie-

949
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.363
- Okay!

950
00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.350
Look. me and Tori are
going up at the house.

951
00:55:58.350 --> 00:55:59.610
to speak to Julien.

952
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:02.523
You two find those other
idiots and meet us there.

953
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:07.140
- If those two are having
tea with Julien right now.

954
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.590
I swear. I'll kill them both.

955
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.670
- Tea with Julien?

956
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:14.430
- Yeah. sorry. It's a bit too normal.

957
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:15.263
- [Michael] Go.

958
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.363
- Don't get paid enough for this.

959
00:56:20.049 --> 00:56:21.570
- I think I should get paid a little more.

960
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:23.703
taking on these extra responsibilities.

961
00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:26.010
- This counts as ad hoc.

962
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:32.049
(eerie music)

963
00:56:59.389 --> 00:57:00.806
- Soon. my child.

964
00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.853
(eerie music continues)

965
00:57:17.479 --> 00:57:20.229
(knocks on door)

966
00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:24.240
- We did say we'd be back
to him this morning. right?

967
00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.073
- Yeah.

968
00:57:26.316 --> 00:57:29.066
(knocks on door)

969
00:57:33.453 --> 00:57:36.453
(suspenseful music)

970
00:57:44.246 --> 00:57:45.246
- Fuck this.

971
00:57:49.436 --> 00:57:51.005
(door squeaks)

972
00:57:51.005 --> 00:57:51.838
Julien?

973
00:57:53.913 --> 00:57:56.013
It's Michael. the director. I'm coming in.

974
00:58:01.053 --> 00:58:03.553
(door creaks)

975
00:58:08.904 --> 00:58:09.737
Julien?

976
00:58:17.932 --> 00:58:18.765
Julien?

977
00:58:23.674 --> 00:58:26.174
(door creaks)

978
00:58:27.754 --> 00:58:30.171
(door slams)

979
00:59:01.325 --> 00:59:03.251
What the fuck?

980
00:59:03.251 --> 00:59:06.834
(ominous orchestral music)

981
00:59:31.111 --> 00:59:33.112
(Tori screams)
(wood thuds)

982
00:59:33.112 --> 00:59:37.790
(Tori grunts wildly)
(wood thuds rapidly)

983
00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:39.131
(Tori pants)

984
00:59:39.131 --> 00:59:43.035
(wood clatters)
(Tori pants)

985
00:59:43.035 --> 00:59:45.702
(Tori chuckles)

986
00:59:49.226 --> 00:59:50.430
- "Ad hoc."

987
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:51.753
Fucking cheap skate.

988
00:59:55.101 --> 00:59:57.725
(Tori pants)

989
00:59:57.725 --> 01:00:00.392
(ominous music)

990
01:00:02.731 --> 01:00:05.398
(Tori chuckles)

991
01:00:12.082 --> 01:00:14.340
- Hey.

992
01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.390
- Did I do good. Dad?

993
01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.630
- We're proud of you.

994
01:00:19.969 --> 01:00:21.370
You've done so much for your sister.

995
01:00:23.529 --> 01:00:26.362
(Julien chuckles)

996
01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.550
- Hughie!

997
01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:30.783
Sadie!

998
01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.880
- You better be decent
by the time I find you!

999
01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:37.613
- What if something's happened to them?

1000
01:00:37.613 --> 01:00:40.200
What if an animal got to them?

1001
01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.223
- An animal?

1002
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:43.650
- Yeah. Well. something's not right.

1003
01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.150
Something's happened.

1004
01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:46.470
- Relax. They'll be fine.

1005
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:49.260
They're cringe little idiots
and they love each other.

1006
01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.090
They're probably trying to sneak past us.

1007
01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:53.243
while pulling on their
clothes on right now.

1008
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:55.710
- Hughie!

1009
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:56.973
Sadie!

1010
01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:01.002
- That was us. once.

1011
01:01:01.002 --> 01:01:02.490
- (sighs) What?

1012
01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:04.233
- Cringe little idiots who love?

1013
01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.833
- Veronica. this isn't the time. Come on.

1014
01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:10.440
- I'm just saying.

1015
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.140
Try and remember how great it was.

1016
01:01:15.015 --> 01:01:17.673
- Well. the way I remember
it. it wasn't great fun.

1017
01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.550
- I don't understand the
fucking nothing reasoning

1018
01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:21.800
why you ended it. though.

1019
01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:26.293
But it's cool. Don't worry about it.

1020
01:01:26.293 --> 01:01:28.980
I don't wonder what was going
on in your head anymore.

1021
01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:29.823
I'm over it now.

1022
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:31.703
- Well. if you didn't know.

1023
01:01:31.703 --> 01:01:33.083
then that says it all. doesn't it?

1024
01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:38.163
- Keep going home alone
and telling yourself that.

1025
01:01:38.163 --> 01:01:40.014
- (sighs) Don't. you!

1026
01:01:40.014 --> 01:01:43.035
(distant giggling)
(suspenseful music)

1027
01:01:43.035 --> 01:01:43.985
- [Santana] Hi. Jo.

1028
01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:48.997
I can't wait for you to be my doll.

1029
01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:50.997
You should come with me.

1030
01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:54.870
- Uh... (chuckles)

1031
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:56.610
Is she for real?

1032
01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:59.302
- That's Santana. I saw her last night.

1033
01:01:59.302 --> 01:02:02.219
(distant giggling)

1034
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.833
- Santana?

1035
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:07.323
Think fast.

1036
01:02:08.939 --> 01:02:11.220
(Santana growls)
(Veronica chuckles)

1037
01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.110
It's just a fucking dolly.

1038
01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:16.316
I'll slice that open. like I
did to mine when I was a kid.

1039
01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:17.847
(Veronica giggles)

1040
01:02:17.847 --> 01:02:20.370
- [Santana] You don't sound very nice.

1041
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:21.240
- Oh.

1042
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.860
I'm not.

1043
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.210
- I think we should go.

1044
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.500
- [Santana] You should come with me. Jo.

1045
01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.653
- She's not going anywhere with you.

1046
01:02:30.136 --> 01:02:31.976
- [Santana] She is mine!

1047
01:02:31.976 --> 01:02:34.476
(tense music)

1048
01:02:42.648 --> 01:02:45.731

(Jo pants)

1055
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.028
- Michael?

1056
01:03:53.028 --> 01:03:53.861
Michael.

1057
01:03:55.058 --> 01:03:56.010
(Jo sighs)

1058
01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:58.448
(dark orchestral music)

1059
01:03:58.448 --> 01:03:59.281
Fuck.

1060
01:04:00.749 --> 01:04:02.916
(Jo sobs)

1061
01:04:11.335 --> 01:04:13.585

1075
01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.410
Sadie! (sobs)

1076
01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:09.150

(Veronica gasps)

1079
01:06:13.368 --> 01:06:16.796
- Who are you?
- Just a fucking dolly.

1080
01:06:16.796 --> 01:06:19.546
(Veronica gasps)

1081
01:06:22.518 --> 01:06:27.518

(chair creaks)

1084
01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:41.163

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.833
Veronica. can you hear me?

1086
01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.013
Veronica!

1087
01:06:46.946 --> 01:06:51.780
(Veronica groans)

1088
01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.883
Oh. my God. Are you okay?

1089
01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:57.393
- I feel like shit.

1090
01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:00.789
(Veronica groans)

1091
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:03.060
(Jo pants)

1092
01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.560
- I think they killed Michael.

1093
01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.023
- Hughie and Sadie. too.

1094
01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:12.300
- [Jo] I'm gonna get out of here. okay?

1095
01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.586
We just have to find Tori and-

1096
01:07:13.586 --> 01:07:18.387
- Oh. hi!
(ominous music)

1097
01:07:18.387 --> 01:07:19.743
- Oh. I'm hearing things.

1098
01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:21.503
- Nope!

1099
01:07:21.503 --> 01:07:23.400
Hi. Veronica!

1100
01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.087
Mm. Sorry about this. Jo.

1101
01:07:25.087 --> 01:07:27.570
"We film the scares. we
don't make the scares."

1102
01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:30.191
I tried to make sure
I didn't frighten you.

1103
01:07:30.191 --> 01:07:31.350
- You're Julien's other daughter.

1104
01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:32.687
- I knew you'd work it out!

1105
01:07:32.687 --> 01:07:35.130
You're so smart. Jo!

1106
01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:37.680
- What's going on there?
What other daughter?

1107
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.580
- [Tori] Surprise!

1108
01:07:40.024 --> 01:07:41.823
- He had two daughters.

1109
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:44.010
You brought us here.

1110
01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:45.540
- Well. you brought us here.

1111
01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.760
So desperate for your big story.

1112
01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.110
My dad found you. though.

1113
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.670
Your series is okay. by the way.

1114
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:51.683
I think I could do better.

1115
01:07:51.683 --> 01:07:54.783
But you look so much like our Santana.

1116
01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.140
See?

1117
01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.040
That's me and Dad!

1118
01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:03.470
Oh. my God. Do you know
what could be amazing?

1119
01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:06.690
If we could turn this into a documentary.

1120
01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:09.090
I mean. we wouldn't be able to
show it to anyone. of course.

1121
01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:11.730
but it would be amazing. wouldn't it?

1122
01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:13.830
Then me and Santana could look back at it.

1123
01:08:15.167 --> 01:08:16.617
- [Jo] You're fucking insane!

1124
01:08:17.969 --> 01:08:20.130
- We're so happy to have you here. Jo.

1125
01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:23.430
We've been looking for a body
for Santana for a long time.

1126
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:26.612
She's quite picky. but she
really seems to like you.

1127
01:08:27.907 --> 01:08:30.569
- You brought us here.
leading us to our deaths.

1128
01:08:30.569 --> 01:08:31.680
How could you?

1129
01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.690
- Not your death. Jo.

1130
01:08:33.690 --> 01:08:34.893
We could never hurt you.

1131
01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:37.139
But yeah. what about everyone else?

1132
01:08:37.139 --> 01:08:39.389
We don't need 'em. do
we? We have each other!

1133
01:08:41.453 --> 01:08:44.100
- Tori. you fucking bitch!

1134
01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.819
Bring your stuffed sister here
and I'm gonna fuck her up!

1135
01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:49.806
And then it'll be your turn!

1136
01:08:49.806 --> 01:08:51.870
- You're so angry. Veronica.

1137
01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:55.495
Do you know how much I fantasized
about breaking your neck?

1138
01:08:55.495 --> 01:09:00.047
(Veronica gasps)
(suspenseful music continues)

1139
01:09:00.047 --> 01:09:01.710
(Tori giggles)

1140
01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:03.330
- Tori.

1141
01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:04.889
It's me you want. isn't it?

1142
01:09:04.889 --> 01:09:06.840
So just let her go.

1143
01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:07.920
Please.

1144
01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.800
- You untie me. I'm
gonna slice that bitch-

1145
01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.819
- Veronica!

1146
01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:12.690
Veronica.

1147
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:13.523
Stop.

1148
01:09:14.969 --> 01:09:15.803
Tori.

1149
01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.406
It's me you want. okay?

1150
01:09:18.406 --> 01:09:21.479
You don't need her. So
just let her go. please.

1151
01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:22.357
- No.

1152
01:09:22.357 --> 01:09:24.780
Actually. we need her.

1153
01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.240
You see. for Santana to take her new body.

1154
01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.740
we need a sacrifice.

1155
01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:32.053
Guess who that is? (chuckles)

1156
01:09:32.053 --> 01:09:34.523
I think that will be my favorite part.

1157
01:09:34.523 --> 01:09:38.585
(Tori giggles)
(suspenseful music continues)

1158
01:09:38.585 --> 01:09:39.417
- No!

1159
01:09:39.417 --> 01:09:40.251
No!

1160
01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:43.756
- Tori. that's enough!

1161
01:09:47.188 --> 01:09:51.021
(suspenseful music continues)

1162
01:09:57.177 --> 01:09:59.227
I'm sorry I had to do all of this. girls.

1163
01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:03.040
I thought I could just take
two lives and it'd all be over.

1164
01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:06.973
But I've had to kill. and kill again!

1165
01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.610
We have needed Santana's blessing.

1166
01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:13.411
and that has been difficult.

1167
01:10:13.411 --> 01:10:15.480
(Veronica yelps)

1168
01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.630
Her spirit has grown very
powerful and very unsettled.

1169
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:21.483
It's taken a lot of work to
find someone she approves of.

1170
01:10:22.469 --> 01:10:23.770
You should be honored. Jo.

1171
01:10:25.748 --> 01:10:26.898
- You're fucking crazy!

1172
01:10:27.858 --> 01:10:29.891
- Silent. or I cover your nose. too!

1173
01:10:29.891 --> 01:10:32.963
(muffled screams)

1174
01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:34.920
(Julien laughs)

1175
01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.910
- Why me?

1176
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:36.743
Why?

1177
01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.053
- Santana went missing one morning.

1178
01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.900
The last time I saw her.

1179
01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.150
she was playing happily
in her favorite spot.

1180
01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.190
The next thing I know. I find
her drowned in the river.

1181
01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:58.260
It fucking destroyed me!
(Veronica yelps)

1182
01:10:58.260 --> 01:10:59.823
I didn't protect her.

1183
01:11:01.119 --> 01:11:02.403
I failed as a father.

1184
01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:08.853
The years passed and
my pain only got worse!

1185
01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:13.080
I couldn't be the father to
Tori that I wanted to be.

1186
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:13.913
because of it.

1187
01:11:15.659 --> 01:11:18.409
(muffled grunts)

1188
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:20.740
But I needed to do something.

1189
01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.010
(Jo yelps)

1190
01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:31.170
(Julien chuckles)
(Jo sobs)

1191
01:11:32.684 --> 01:11:34.080
The pain.

1192
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.718
The grief. The sorrow.

1193
01:11:35.718 --> 01:11:38.550
All of that cursed Santana's soul.

1194
01:11:39.509 --> 01:11:44.509
It was my fault!
(Jo screams)

1195
01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.163
I made her a temporary body.

1196
01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.373
and now all I can do is free her.

1197
01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.900
She is trapped. and she will stay trapped.

1198
01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.450
until she finds the perfect host.

1199
01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.920
And she does have to be perfect.

1200
01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:05.142
(Jo sobs)

1201
01:12:05.142 --> 01:12:08.110
(Veronica grunts)

1202
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:09.450
(Veronica screams)

1203
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:10.734
Shut up!

1204
01:12:10.734 --> 01:12:14.400
(Veronica screams)

1205
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.250
Tori was looking for her sister. too.

1206
01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:20.612
We'd almost given up. until I found you.

1207
01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:24.120
As soon as I heard your voice.

1208
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.973
before I ever saw your face. I just knew.

1209
01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:32.219
You were everything I
imagined Santana to be.

1210
01:12:32.219 --> 01:12:33.243
If she had lived.

1211
01:12:34.770 --> 01:12:36.120
Santana knew. too.

1212
01:12:38.474 --> 01:12:41.807
(intense ominous tones)

1213
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:48.010
(suspenseful music continues)

1214
01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:49.147
Now we can begin.

1215
01:12:49.147 --> 01:12:54.594
(Veronica screams)

1216
01:12:55.837 --> 01:12:58.472
- Please let us go! Just please. Julien.

1217
01:12:58.472 --> 01:12:59.305
Please.

1218
01:13:00.239 --> 01:13:02.489
(Jo yelps)

1219
01:13:04.475 --> 01:13:09.475
(Jo whimpers)
(Julien chuckles)

1220
01:13:10.162 --> 01:13:12.677
Please! Please just let us go!

1221
01:13:12.677 --> 01:13:13.510
Please!

1222
01:13:15.205 --> 01:13:16.684
(Jo screams)

1223
01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:20.165
(Veronica screams)

1224
01:13:20.165 --> 01:13:21.616
(Veronica grunts)
(Julien chuckles)

1225
01:13:21.616 --> 01:13:23.087
(Veronica grunts)

1226
01:13:23.087 --> 01:13:26.670
(clock ticks rhythmically)

1227
01:13:27.848 --> 01:13:31.946
(knife thuds)
(Veronica screams)

1228
01:13:31.946 --> 01:13:35.029
(Veronica splutters)

1229
01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:41.096
(Veronica gasps)

1230
01:13:41.096 --> 01:13:43.664
(Veronica splutters)

1231
01:13:43.664 --> 01:13:45.304
(Veronica chokes)

1232
01:13:45.304 --> 01:13:48.387
(Veronica splutters)

1233
01:13:55.416 --> 01:13:57.093
- [Julien] It is with blood
running the trapped souls

1234
01:13:57.093 --> 01:13:58.653
find a crack to escape.

1235
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:01.833
Tori. focus!

1236
01:14:05.309 --> 01:14:07.258
(flesh crunches)
(Tori screams)

1237
01:14:07.258 --> 01:14:09.690
(Tori pants)

1238
01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:11.690
- [Tori] Fucking bitch!

1239
01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:12.960
(Tori pants)

1240
01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.010
- What have you done?

1241
01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.282
You spoiled the blood of the sacrifice.

1242
01:14:23.187 --> 01:14:25.230
- No. I didn't. They can
drink from the same cup.

1243
01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:28.666
- They cannot drink the
mixed blood. you fool!

1244
01:14:28.666 --> 01:14:30.014
Fuck!
- Forgive me.

1245
01:14:30.014 --> 01:14:35.014
(Tori pants)
(suspenseful music continues)

1246
01:14:40.889 --> 01:14:44.392
- We finish this. we will
have our Santana back.

1247
01:14:44.392 --> 01:14:46.809
(Tori pants)

1248
01:14:52.423 --> 01:14:54.591
(head thuds)
(Tori groans)

1249
01:14:54.591 --> 01:14:55.424
No!

1250
01:14:57.172 --> 01:14:59.589
(Tori moans)

1251
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:03.287
(Tori moans)

1252
01:15:05.371 --> 01:15:07.379
(hurried footsteps approach)

1253
01:15:07.379 --> 01:15:09.629
(Jo pants)

1254
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.666
(ominous music)

1255
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:21.763
Jo!

1256
01:15:28.989 --> 01:15:31.239
(Jo pants)

1257
01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:38.603
Jo!

1258
01:15:40.921 --> 01:15:45.088
The longer you hide. it'll
only get worse for you!

1259
01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:52.378
Where the hell is she?

1260
01:16:02.918 --> 01:16:05.168
(Jo pants)

1261
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:15.770
(ominous music continues)

1262
01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:24.160
I'm not gonna hurt you!

1263
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.160
I need you fit and well!

1264
01:16:27.431 --> 01:16:29.476
I am everywhere!

1265
01:16:29.476 --> 01:16:30.393
Everywhere!

1266
01:16:36.193 --> 01:16:37.027
Jo.

1267
01:16:38.316 --> 01:16:39.148
Jo!

1268
01:16:44.714 --> 01:16:46.297
Jo. I love a chase.

1269
01:16:50.781 --> 01:16:51.614
Jo!

1270
01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.138

Jo.

1273
01:17:04.615 --> 01:17:05.448
Jo.

1274
01:17:07.146 --> 01:17:07.978
Jo?

1275
01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:12.541
Know you're in here.
and I'm coming for you.

1276

(Jo pants)

1277
01:17:21.447 --> 01:17:24.947
(ominous music continues)

1278
01:17:36.186 --> 01:17:38.403
(pitchfork thuds)
(Jo pants)

1279
01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:39.584

(pitchfork thuds)

1280
01:17:39.584 --> 01:17:44.315

(dark music)

1281
01:17:44.315 --> 01:17:45.654
(Julien groans)

1282
01:17:45.654 --> 01:17:48.571
(Julien splutters)

1283
01:17:51.764 --> 01:17:53.713
(somber orchestral music)

1284
01:17:53.713 --> 01:17:56.630
(Julien splutters)

1285
01:17:58.585 --> 01:18:01.252
(Julien groans)

1286
01:18:03.891 --> 01:18:06.502
(pitchfork clatters)
(Tori pants)

1287
01:18:06.502 --> 01:18:08.252
- What have you done?

1288
01:18:10.003 --> 01:18:11.790
You killed my dad.

1289
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:14.550
- He wasn't well. Tori! How
many people did he kill?

1290
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:16.350
- He did what he had to!

1291
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:18.690
All he wanted was for
us to be a family again!

1292
01:18:18.690 --> 01:18:21.690
- Look. I'm gonna get out of here.

1293
01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:24.034
You can come. too. You're a good girl.

1294
01:18:24.034 --> 01:18:25.170
And this can just be-

1295
01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:27.960
- You're not going anywhere.
(tense music)

1296
01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.540
You know what? I used to
think you were so amazing.

1297
01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.550
I couldn't wait for us to be sisters.

1298
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:35.850
to get my Santana back. but
you're not worthy of her.

1299
01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:37.320
- She must have been so
special for you to go to-

1300
01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:39.333
- She was my best friend!

1301
01:18:39.333 --> 01:18:42.061
I didn't mean for her to die.

1302
01:18:42.061 --> 01:18:44.760
(distant giggling)

1303
01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.610
- You killed her?

1304
01:18:47.398 --> 01:18:49.080
- It was an accident.

1305
01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.177
She fell and I couldn't save her.

1306
01:18:51.177 --> 01:18:54.030
But she fell because of me.
so I have to do this for her.

1307
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:56.010
- Tori. look. You're not bad sister. okay?

1308
01:18:56.010 --> 01:18:58.209
You're not. You're a good kid. okay?

1309
01:18:58.209 --> 01:19:00.690
We can get out of here.
We can go start fresh.

1310
01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:03.389
We can start new. we... (chuckles)

1311
01:19:03.389 --> 01:19:04.623
- I killed Michael. too.

1312
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:08.253
I meant that one.

1313
01:19:09.441 --> 01:19:12.472
(eerie tones)
(suspenseful music continues)

1314

(Jo pants)

1319
01:19:30.846 --> 01:19:34.179
(intense ominous tones)

1320
01:19:35.968 --> 01:19:39.347
- I'm sorry for your dad and
your sister. but it's over.

1321
01:19:39.347 --> 01:19:42.995
- [Santana] Then you are not necessary.

1322
01:19:42.995 --> 01:19:44.487
(intense ominous tones)

1323
01:19:44.487 --> 01:19:46.821

1324
01:19:49.148 --> 01:19:50.898
You're so pretty. Jo.

1325
01:19:52.952 --> 01:19:56.072
I can't wait for you to be my doll.

1326
01:19:56.072 --> 01:19:59.239
(Jo gasps and chokes)

1327
01:20:15.929 --> 01:20:18.429
(eerie music)

1328
01:20:22.249 --> 01:20:25.166

(Jo hums cheerfully)

1333
01:20:57.436 --> 01:20:59.835
(Jo hums cheerfully)

1334
01:20:59.835 --> 01:21:03.647
(Jo breathes deeply)

1335

- You're so pretty.

1336
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:07.559
Thanks for being my doll.
