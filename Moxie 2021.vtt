Well. Lucy.
since you did the summer reading.

151
00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:29.125
I'll ask you the first question
we apparently have to ask

152
00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.500
about every work of art now.

153
00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:33.583
no matter what it's about
or what time period it was created.

How are women portrayed?

155
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.375
Well. I think the real question is.
why are we still reading this book?

156
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:46.666
It's written by some rich white guy
about some rich white guy.

157
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.125
and I guess we're supposed
to feel bad for him

158
00:08:49.208 --> 00:08:52.208
because he's obsessed
with the only girl he can't have?

159
00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:54.541
If the point is to learn
about the American dream.

160
00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:58.916
we should be reading about immigrants.
or the working class. or Black mothers.

161
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.083
or at least someone
who doesn't have a mansion.

-I thought it was great.

Hey. I was talking.

164
00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:10.875
Yeah. I know.
but The Great Gatsby is a classic.

165
00:09:11.458 --> 00:09:14.750
Just because other books are good
doesn't mean this is less good.

-You're not listening to me.

and have loved The Great Gatsby forever.

that makes it so we read it every year

01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:11.916
Claudia got suspended for Moxie.

1536
01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:15.083
What…? What do you mean?

1537
01:25:15.166 --> 01:25:17.833
Yeah. it's pretty awesome.
She took one for the team.

1538
01:25:19.458 --> 01:25:22.166
-That's not awesome.
-[Lucy] She's gonna be fine.

1539
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.333
She'll write about it
on a college application.

1540
01:25:24.416 --> 01:25:25.416
and people will freak.

1541
01:25:26.166 --> 01:25:28.625
-She'll be fine.
-Don't tell me about Claudia.

1542
01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:32.208
She's been my best friend my whole life.
and you only just got here.

1543
01:25:34.416 --> 01:25:35.541
Okay. Wow.

1544
01:25:39.291 --> 01:25:40.291
[doorbell chimes]

1545
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:44.750
No.

1546
01:25:50.583 --> 01:25:51.541
[knocking]

1547
01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:05.916
Front door didn't go so great. huh?

1548
01:26:06.416 --> 01:26:08.000
I'd call it a bust.

1549
01:26:08.583 --> 01:26:13.083
Yeah. My mom would literally prefer
I die of contracting bacterial meningitis

1550
01:26:13.166 --> 01:26:14.958
than get suspended from school.

1551
01:26:15.041 --> 01:26:17.208
Disease is at least an honorable death.

1552
01:26:18.416 --> 01:26:20.666
This is gonna screw everything up for you.

1553
01:26:21.458 --> 01:26:22.333
I don't know.

1554
01:26:23.333 --> 01:26:26.166
Shelly's blaming me
because I put my name down for Moxie.

1555
01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:28.000
I can't believe you did that.

1556
01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:29.041
[softly] Yeah.

1557
01:26:30.958 --> 01:26:34.166
She kept asking me who the leader was.
and I said I didn't know.

1558
01:26:38.458 --> 01:26:40.083
Is there anything you wanna say?

1559
01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:45.500
How did you know?

1560
01:26:47.333 --> 01:26:49.833
We've been best friends
since we were four.

1561
01:26:49.916 --> 01:26:52.458
You think you could lead a revolt
and I wouldn't notice?

1562
01:26:55.666 --> 01:26:57.041
Why didn't you tell me?

1563
01:26:58.208 --> 01:27:00.416
At first. you were being
so shitty about it.

1564
01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.208
Yeah. because I knew
it was a bad idea. and look. It was.

1565
01:27:04.291 --> 01:27:07.000
-I didn't ask you to get involved.
-Yes. you did.

1566
01:27:07.708 --> 01:27:10.125
You made me feel bad
because I wasn't doing enough.

1567
01:27:10.958 --> 01:27:12.583
And you don't get it. Viv.

1568
01:27:12.666 --> 01:27:15.375
You don't get what's going on
with me because you're white.

1569
01:27:16.166 --> 01:27:17.458
Wh-What?

1570
01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:20.125
Do you know what my mom sacrificed
to get to this country?

1571
01:27:20.708 --> 01:27:23.791
What she had to do to make it
so that I could go to college?

1572
01:27:25.125 --> 01:27:27.875
I am under an insane amount of pressure.

1573
01:27:28.458 --> 01:27:31.125
I don't have the freedom
to take the risks that you do.

1574
01:27:31.208 --> 01:27:32.708
-Claudia. I'm sorry.
-I gotta go.

1575
01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.500
My mom is making me
deep clean the rugs to atone for my sins.

1576
01:27:38.916 --> 01:27:41.500
If you knew it was me.
why didn't you tell her?

1577
01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:46.083
Because I'm not a coward. unlike you.

1578
01:27:49.375 --> 01:27:50.333
[Claudia sniffs]

1579
01:27:57.083 --> 01:27:57.916
Oh. right.

1580
01:27:58.958 --> 01:28:00.375
This whole thing.

1581
01:28:09.375 --> 01:28:11.291
[Lisa] We have so many breadsticks.

1582
01:28:11.375 --> 01:28:13.291
[John and Lisa chuckle]

1583
01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:15.458
[John] Oh. are those the ones I gave you?

1584
01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:17.791
I got fresh ones just for you.

1585
01:28:18.625 --> 01:28:20.375
-[chuckling]
-What is that voice?

1586
01:28:22.416 --> 01:28:23.291
It's my voice.

1587
01:28:24.291 --> 01:28:25.416
No. it's not.

1588
01:28:27.583 --> 01:28:28.541
[Lisa sighs deeply]

1589
01:28:30.833 --> 01:28:33.166
So. what's new in teen life these days?

1590
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.375
Not much. man. Um…

1591
01:28:37.208 --> 01:28:39.166
Physics is really crushing me.

1592
01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:41.916
-[laughing] Oh. physics took me out.
-Yeah.

1593
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.208
You guys have so much in common.
Maybe you should share a high-five.

1594
01:28:47.375 --> 01:28:50.541
Um. do they still teach you
those. um. mnemonic devices

1595
01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:52.333
to help you remember all the laws?

1596
01:28:52.416 --> 01:28:54.083
-If they do. it's not working.
-[laughs]

1597
01:28:54.166 --> 01:28:58.958
It was like for thermodynamics.
"Something something never really tire."

1598
01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:02.666
PV equals NRT. Pure virgins--

1599
01:29:03.625 --> 01:29:05.458
[sighs] It was a different time.

1600
01:29:05.541 --> 01:29:07.333
Why is nobody asking me about physics?

1601
01:29:07.416 --> 01:29:10.166
Do you think because I'm a girl
I don't know about science?

1602
01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:12.791
Not at all.
You want to talk about physics?

1603
01:29:12.875 --> 01:29:14.041
You made a salad?

1604
01:29:14.708 --> 01:29:15.958
With green things in it?

1605
01:29:16.541 --> 01:29:20.208
Yes. that's the colors
that are traditionally found in a salad.

1606
01:29:20.291 --> 01:29:23.791
This isn't normal. She usually
lives off frozen pizza and ice cream.

1607
01:29:24.375 --> 01:29:28.125
Well. with our hours.
it's hard to find time to make dinner.

1608
01:29:28.208 --> 01:29:29.875
That's okay. I love to cook.

1609
01:29:31.875 --> 01:29:34.125
Why do you have
an American flag on your car?

1610
01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.875
Do you love America?
Do you think it's perfect?

1611
01:29:37.958 --> 01:29:41.583
Do you know it's gonna take 300 years
to reach gender equality in the US?

1612
01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:43.625
I don't love that part.

1613
01:29:43.708 --> 01:29:46.291
If you don't love that part.
what are you doing about it?

1614
01:29:46.375 --> 01:29:47.458
Hey. Viv.

1615
01:29:47.541 --> 01:29:49.000
[scoffs] Okay. What? What?

1616
01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:51.083
You want me to calm down?

1617
01:29:51.166 --> 01:29:54.541
You want me to be nice? Like you?
And make sure everybody's comfortable?

1618
01:29:54.625 --> 01:29:57.208
Be your cute little girlfriend
with a little ponytail.

1619
01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:59.875
Well. forget hearts and stars on my hand.

1620
01:29:59.958 --> 01:30:04.458
Why don't I just write your name on my arm
and tell everybody that I'm your property

1621
01:30:04.541 --> 01:30:05.375
or something?

1622
01:30:05.458 --> 01:30:07.291
-Vivian.
-Fuck the patriarchy!

1623
01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:15.208
[John sighs]

1624
01:30:15.291 --> 01:30:16.708
What's going on?

1625
01:30:16.791 --> 01:30:18.083
I'm not like you.

1626
01:30:18.625 --> 01:30:21.208
I don't want you to be like me.
I want you to be like you.

1627
01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:24.458
I hate that. That's the suckiest thing
you can say to someone.

1628
01:30:24.541 --> 01:30:28.125
Just be you. Just be yourself.
I mean. that is such bullshit mom talk.

1629
01:30:28.208 --> 01:30:30.708
Okay. Okay. What do you want me to say?

1630
01:30:30.791 --> 01:30:32.083
Can you just leave?

1631
01:30:32.166 --> 01:30:34.583
No. this is my house.
I get to stand wherever I want.

1632
01:30:35.166 --> 01:30:36.500
Oh. right. Yeah. I forgot.

1633
01:30:36.583 --> 01:30:38.916
You're a rebel girl.
and no one tells you what to do

1634
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.416
unless it's some lame dork who flirts
with you once in a grocery store.

1635
01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.375
Hey. you can't talk to me like that.

1636
01:30:44.458 --> 01:30:46.375
I'm your mother and I'm also a person.

1637
01:30:46.458 --> 01:30:49.541
and I get lonely.
and it's nice when someone likes me.

1638
01:30:49.625 --> 01:30:52.416
Okay. fine.
then just go enjoy your spring salad

1639
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.125
while I sit here
with my entire life falling apart.

1640
01:30:55.208 --> 01:30:56.416
What is falling apart?

1641
01:30:57.541 --> 01:30:58.375
Nothing.

1642
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.208
Just Claudia won't talk to me.
I might get kicked out of school.

1643
01:31:02.291 --> 01:31:03.583
and I might have sex.

1644
01:31:04.208 --> 01:31:06.083
Wait. you might get kicked out?

1645
01:31:06.166 --> 01:31:08.250
You don't care that I might have sex?

1646
01:31:08.333 --> 01:31:09.416
Vivian. slow down.

1647
01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:13.291
Shelly said anybody associated
with Moxie is gonna get kicked out.

1648
01:31:13.375 --> 01:31:14.750
Claudia already was.

1649
01:31:14.833 --> 01:31:16.208
What is Moxie?

1650
01:31:17.375 --> 01:31:18.958
It's a feminist club I started.

1651
01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:23.625
-You started a feminist club?
-Yeah. and it's all your fault.

1652
01:31:24.208 --> 01:31:26.791
I only started Moxie
because you made me believe

1653
01:31:26.875 --> 01:31:30.500
I was strong or something.
but I'm not that kind of person.

1654
01:31:30.583 --> 01:31:33.083
None of it is working.
and no one is helping me.

1655

for a crime he didn't commit.

There's nothing.

-[Mr. Davies] He's a gangster.

leaves it so ambiguous at the end.

1666
01:32:25.583 --> 01:32:27.708
Is he good? Is he bad? I don't know.

1667
01:32:27.791 --> 01:32:29.583
He wants you to ask that question.

1668
01:32:29.666 --> 01:32:32.416
He wants you to look upon yourself
and your morality.

1669

Hey. are you mad at me?

1674
01:33:14.958 --> 01:33:18.541
You mean for yelling at me at the table
and ditching me during dinner?

1675
01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.625
Nah. Vivian. why would I be mad at you?

1676
01:33:22.625 --> 01:33:25.083
I'm sorry.
I've been under a lot of pressure lately.
