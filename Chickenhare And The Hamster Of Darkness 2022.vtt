3
00:00:57.917 --> 00:00:59.542
Told you I'd find it.

4
00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:01.917
But not if they found it first.

5
00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.375
I doubt it.

6
00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:09.667
It looks to me like that crocodile
won't have to feed for a while.

7
00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:35.917
And to think you.

8
00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:38.292
and everyone. doubted me.

9
00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:42.417
You know. I don't even know why
I let you come. Brother…

10
00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:49.333
I'm sure you'll think of a reason.

11
00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:10.000
The Hamster of Darkness.

12
00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:12.708
Finally.

13
00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:14.958
And when I bring this back
to the kingdom.

14
00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:18.042
nobody's going to be laughing
at my ear anymore.

15
00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:19.208
No.

16
00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:21.917
I'm going to be the one
who's laughing…

17
00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:23.583
not at my ear of course.

18
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.500
But because I was right.

19
00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:28.042
that the hamster is real.

20
00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:36.583
Something does not feel right.

21
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.958
Oh hush.

22
00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:41.583
let me enjoy
this glorious moment.

23
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.083
<i>Twenty years ago my father</i>
<i>and his brother Lapin</i>

24
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.292
<i>almost found the greatest</i>
<i>artifact in the world.</i>

25
00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:08.208
I'm sorry. Lapin.

26
00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:10.292
This isn't happening.

27
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.333
- What the…?
- Over there.

28
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.000
<i>But they found something else…</i>

29
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.750
<i>Me.</i>

30
00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:27.208
What is it?

31
00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.333
The little freak's
pointing at my ear!

32
00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:33.208
No. he's not.

33
00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:35.167
He did it again!

34
00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:37.833
Nonsense. He's adorable.

35
00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:39.792
Hi there. little guy.

36
00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:41.708
You're not taking him back with us?

37
00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:42.917
I'm not leaving him.

38
00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:46.375
Good thing I'm the older brother
and will be king someday.

39
00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:47.958
because you're too soft. Brother!

40
00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:50.000
Way too soft!

41
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.042
<i>My uncle never found</i>
<i>the Hamster of Darkness.</i>

42
00:03:53.208 --> 00:03:54.958
<i>And he was never named king.</i>

43
00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:57.500
<i>But we'll get to that soon enough…</i>

44
00:04:30.042 --> 00:04:32.417
<i>From the moment</i>
<i>my dad brought me home.</i>

45
00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:34.333
<i>I was preparing for the day</i>

46
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.458
<i>when I would become</i>
<i>a great adventurer like him.</i>

47
00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:44.042
There you go.

48
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.292
Nice slap of the wrist.

49
00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:01.167
What do you think?

50
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.125
<i>My favorite days were the days</i>

51
00:05:08.292 --> 00:05:10.833
<i>when my dad returned</i>
<i>from an adventure…</i>

52
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.333
Personally. I don't see
what the big deal is…

53
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.250
I mean. they just found old junk.

54
00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:20.125
I find old junk in alleys
and nobody's throwing me a parade.

55
00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:22.458
That's my turtle servant Abe.

56
00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:25.333
He's a "glass-is-all-empty" kind of guy.

57
00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:29.125
- Dad!
- Hi there. little guy.

58
00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:31.625
Did you find the fork
from the last brunch?

59
00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:33.792
And the knife!

60
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:37.667
But I couldn't find the spoon!

61
00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:39.750
Of course. I found the spoon!

62
00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:49.708
<i>When I saw how everyone looked up</i>
<i>to adventurers like my dad.</i>

63
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.125
<i>there and then I decided</i>
<i>that's how I wanted them to see me.</i>

64
00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:03.667
And so there I was. 200 feet
above hare-eating crocodiles.

65
00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:06.125
hanging from a cliff.

66
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.667
- And then what happened?
- And then…

67
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.167
you went to bed.

68
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.667
That's why they call it
a cliffhanger. pal.

69
00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:22.458
Good night.
my future royal adventurer.

70
00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:42.042
<i>I was obsessed with adventuring.</i>

71
00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:44.625
<i>I stayed up every night reading.</i>

72
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.083
Stupid feathers…

73
00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:04.042
<i>I devoured every book about adventuring</i>
<i>and spent hours in the royal library…</i>

74
00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:07.833
<i>I could not get enough of it.</i>
<i>I knew the day would come.</i>

75
00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:24.250
I don't think heavy lifting
is in my job description.

76
00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:44.792
The tryouts. let's go. Abe.

77
00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:11.917
<i>Every year I watched</i>
<i>the Royal Adventure Society tryouts.</i>

78
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.125
<i>determined to pick up tips</i>
<i>for when it was my turn to run.</i>

79
00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:20.333
Why'd you invite him to sit with us?

80
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.875
My dad made me
'cause his dad's the new king.

81
00:08:24.042 --> 00:08:26.667
I can't believe we gotta be seen
with that freak Chickenhare.

82
00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:27.833
It could be worse.

83
00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:30.375
We could be Chickenhare.

84
00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:33.125
- Right?
- Oh man.

85
00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:18.167
That was a lot of fun.

86
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:19.750
What a crock.

87
00:09:19.917 --> 00:09:23.208
the competitors are getting
better and better every year.

88
00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:25.500
- Some world classic…
- Chickenhare?

89
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.667
What are you wearing?

90
00:09:29.667 --> 00:09:31.917
Like it? It's very in.

91
00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:34.500
It's very now… now.

92
00:09:34.667 --> 00:09:39.125
Boots that make you look like
you have hare feet are very now… now?

93
00:09:39.292 --> 00:09:42.167
Style's changed a lot since
you were a kid. Dad.

94
00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:44.917
Come on.
let's take that hat off so I can…

95
00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:46.125
No!

96
00:09:46.292 --> 00:09:48.625
Everybody laughs at me. Dad.

97
00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:51.917
I know it's hard being different.

98
00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:55.958
No. you don't know.
Nobody knows what it's like to be me.

99
00:09:56.917 --> 00:09:59.875
Chickenhare.
now what have I always told you?

100
00:10:00.042 --> 00:10:02.542
The things that make us different…

101
00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:04.958
Are the things that make us special.

102
00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:08.083
Yeah. I know. Dad.
But I don't wanna be special.

103
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.083
I just wanna be normal.

104
00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:12.292
And wearing this.

105
00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:15.042
I feel normal.

106
00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.667
Maybe I'm not as up
on the fashion trends as I used to be.

107
00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:23.083
It's not just you. Dad!

108
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.833
It's all old people.

109
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.833
And check out what I can do
in my new boots.

110
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.417
I'm okay.

111
00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:35.583
All good…

112
00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.167
Little sore. but good.

113
00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:39.750
It's just a phase.
He'll grow out of it.

114
00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:17.250
This is it. Abe. Moment of truth.

115
00:11:17.417 --> 00:11:19.667
The day all my dreams come true.

116
00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:22.542
Remember my three keys to success?

117
00:11:22.708 --> 00:11:25.708
Don't. Screw. Up.

118
00:11:26.583 --> 00:11:28.958
In accordance with the laws
in the Royal Rulebook.

119
00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:32.208
those applicants today
who reach the finish line

120
00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:37.333
shall be considered for
the Royal Adventure Society for life.

121
00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.083
First up. Chickenhare.

122
00:11:52.583 --> 00:11:54.708
This should be interesting!

123
00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:11.083
Come on!

124
00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:20.333
That's just slowing me down.

125
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.500
What are you doing?

126
00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:40.417
Ouch. that hurts.

127
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.208
Just getting my bearings.

128
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.875
Time to make up some ground.

129
00:13:06.708 --> 00:13:07.708
Here we go.

130
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.542
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Just go on.

131
00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:29.417
Sorry!

132
00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:47.583
Hey. that's cheating!

133
00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:08.958
Come on.

134
00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:10.250
You're almost there.

135
00:14:10.417 --> 00:14:13.792
All you have to do is get across
the Really-Really-Deep-

136
00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958
But-Not-Quite-Bottomless-Pit.

137
00:14:20.708 --> 00:14:22.125
Careful. Son.

138
00:14:22.917 --> 00:14:25.875
I can't watch.
but I can't look away.

139
00:14:32.208 --> 00:14:33.208
Easy.

140
00:14:39.292 --> 00:14:40.375
- Come here.
- Let it go!

141
00:15:07.708 --> 00:15:11.042
- Well. there's always a plan B.
- I don't have a plan B.

142
00:15:11.208 --> 00:15:13.333
You could become a stamp collector.

143
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.333
Yeah. it's like an adventure
every time the mail comes.

144
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.000
And the mail comes every day.
That's a lot of adventures.

145
00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:24.667
What's so great about being
a royal adventurer anyway?

146
00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:26.458
Besides the fame and adulation?

147
00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:29.375
Hey. Chickenhare. nice work today!

148
00:15:29.542 --> 00:15:31.250
Nothing but net!

149
00:15:32.542 --> 00:15:35.625
What'd you expect?
He's mostly chicken.

150
00:15:36.042 --> 00:15:37.458
No. he's mostly hare.

151
00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:38.708
- Chicken!
- Hare!

152
00:15:38.875 --> 00:15:40.417
- Chicken!
- Hare!

153
00:15:40.583 --> 00:15:44.125
You know. if you close your eyes
and take it out of context.

154
00:15:44.292 --> 00:15:46.333
it sounds like
they're cheering for you.

155
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.708
Chicken! Hare! Chicken! Hare!

156
00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:50.875
Chicken…

157
00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.583
Why can't I be like everyone else?

158
00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.208
Chickenhare?

159
00:16:01.375 --> 00:16:03.333
Geez. Dad. think you could knock?

160
00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:05.333
Sorry.

161
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.208
Thought you'd want to talk
about what happened today.

162
00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:09.750
Oh. that.

163
00:16:10.417 --> 00:16:12.208
Just a minor setback is all.

164
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.167
Next year. I'm gonna focus
on doing more cardio.

165
00:16:15.333 --> 00:16:17.625
Maybe some altitude training.

166
00:16:17.792 --> 00:16:20.333
You do know you can't audition twice.

167
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.083
Well I figured since you're the King.
you could make an exception.

168
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.167
I can't break the rules
just because you're my son.

169
00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:28.792
Come on. Dad.

170
00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.792
All I need is one more shot.
I know I could crush it…

171
00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.667
Chickenhare. you need
to put your energies elsewhere.

172
00:16:38.917 --> 00:16:42.875
I know it's difficult
to let go of your dream.

173
00:16:43.042 --> 00:16:45.833
I just don't want
to see you get hurt again.

174
00:16:47.292 --> 00:16:49.500
Is this because I embarrassed you?

175
00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:53.458
Chickenhare.
You could never embarrass me.

176
00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:57.708
When I look at you.
I wish you could see what I see.

177
00:16:57.875 --> 00:16:59.708
Yeah. wish I could too.

178
00:16:59.875 --> 00:17:03.500
All I see is that I got the worst parts
of a hare and a chicken.

179
00:17:03.667 --> 00:17:05.958
Maybe you got the best parts.

180
00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:07.625
Do you know

181
00:17:07.792 --> 00:17:10.583
the greatest treasure I ever found?

182
00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.917
The Fountain of Middle Age?

183
00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:14.500
It was you.

184
00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:19.417
Finding you when Uncle Lapin and I went
searching for the Hamster of Darkness

185
00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:22.250
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

186
00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:24.792
Goodnight. Son.

187
00:17:40.208 --> 00:17:41.750
Oh. shut up!

188
00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:45.292
I've studied adventuring

189
00:17:45.458 --> 00:17:47.000
more than anybody. right?

190
00:17:47.792 --> 00:17:51.875
I've gotta figure out the location
of the treasure that every adventurer

191
00:17:52.042 --> 00:17:54.625
has been searching for.
but has never found…

192
00:17:59.333 --> 00:18:01.000
And when I figure that out.

193
00:18:01.167 --> 00:18:04.042
he'll have to let me
into the Royal Adventurer Society.

194
00:18:06.875 --> 00:18:07.875
What's the treasure?

195
00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:11.125
Come on.
you know what I'm talking about.

196
00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:14.167
The greatest
undiscovered treasure of all time…

197
00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:17.875
Gotcha. The greatest
undiscovered treasure of all time.

198
00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:19.333
I have no idea.

199
00:18:19.917 --> 00:18:23.500
Arturo the Rodent King created it
to take over the world.

200
00:18:23.917 --> 00:18:25.167
Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.

201
00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:27.708
Then his brother Ramon
stole it and hid it

202
00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:29.875
before Arturo could use it.

203
00:18:30.833 --> 00:18:33.833
It's got the power
of a million hamsters!

204
00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:37.875
Nope. still don't have it.

205
00:18:38.292 --> 00:18:40.833
It rhymes
with the "Damster of Harkness".

206
00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:50.250
The Hamster of Darkness. Abe!
How could you not get that?

207
00:18:50.583 --> 00:18:53.375
From where I'm sitting.
it was a problem with the clues.

208
00:18:53.542 --> 00:18:55.375
According to the old legends.

209
00:18:55.542 --> 00:18:57.667
"At the hour of 9
on a new day's dawn.

210
00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:01.125
"the constellation
of the hamster shall point

211
00:19:01.292 --> 00:19:03.500
"to The Temple
of the Hamster of Darkness."

212
00:19:03.667 --> 00:19:05.083
Well. it's almost 9

213
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.833
which means I'm about
to make time-and-a-half.

214
00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:10.250
There's just one problem.

215
00:19:10.417 --> 00:19:12.875
You can't see a constellation
at 9 in the morning.

216
00:19:13.042 --> 00:19:14.125
It's too bright out.

217
00:19:14.292 --> 00:19:17.000
- We gotta be missing something.
- Yeah. breakfast.

218
00:19:17.292 --> 00:19:19.208
- I'm starving!
- I need the original text.

219
00:19:32.042 --> 00:19:34.167
<i>Erik the Literal's Volume 13</i>

220
00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:36.833
on the Hamster of Darkness
is checked out.

221
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.333
When's it due back?

222
00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.458
Three months ago.

223
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.250
Fine. I'll go get it myself.
So. who's got it?

224
00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:46.750
Your Uncle Lapin.

225
00:19:51.333 --> 00:19:55.083
So how long has it been
since you've seen your uncle?

226
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.917
Not since he tried
to overthrow my father.

227
00:19:58.083 --> 00:20:01.875
He wasn't happy that my grandfather
chose my dad as king and not him.

228
00:20:02.042 --> 00:20:03.958
Talk about rich people's problems.

229
00:20:04.125 --> 00:20:05.375
Let's go.

230
00:20:05.542 --> 00:20:06.917
I'm sure time has mellowed him.

231
00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:09.125
Oh no.
My duties as your turtleservant

232
00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:11.208
do not extend to accompanying you

233
00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:14.417
to meet with your terrifying uncle
in his jail cell.

234
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.833
Nothing about meeting
with evil uncles in their jail cells…

235
00:20:19.542 --> 00:20:21.500
See. this is why you join a union.

236
00:20:21.667 --> 00:20:24.375
Servants-and-Bed-Pan-Handlers Local 645.

237
00:20:24.542 --> 00:20:26.542
Strength through numbers.

238
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.750
What's he in for?

239
00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:51.083
Murder.

240
00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:52.417
Tax evasion.

241
00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:55.167
I murdered the tax code.

242
00:20:56.125 --> 00:21:00.333
The prison that can hold Barry Goldfarb
hasn't been built!

243
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.042
Some rules to remember:

244
00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:06.500
Do not pass Lapin anything
as he will turn it into a weapon.

245
00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:07.875
even a carrot.

246
00:21:08.042 --> 00:21:10.417
Do not approach his cell.
Do not touch the bars.

247
00:21:10.583 --> 00:21:12.667
And whatever you do.
don't reach through the bars.

248
00:21:12.833 --> 00:21:15.667
The last guy to do that
spent a month in the hospital.

249
00:21:15.833 --> 00:21:19.875
Granted that was for the flu.
But I'm sure he caught it from Lapin.

250
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.750
You're not coming with me?

251
00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:26.083
The union says I don't have to.
Thank goodness

252
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.167
for Prison-Guards-and-Haberdashers
Local 646.

253
00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:31.125
Strength through numbers.

254
00:21:59.833 --> 00:22:00.833
Nephew?

255
00:22:01.875 --> 00:22:03.750
What a pleasant surprise.

256
00:22:04.292 --> 00:22:05.625
Hi. Uncle Lapin.

257
00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:09.333
I was in the neighborhood
and thought it might be nice

258
00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:12.833
to stop by and say "hi".

259
00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:14.167
So…

260
00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:15.625
Hi!

261
00:22:16.542 --> 00:22:17.625
And oh yeah.

262
00:22:17.792 --> 00:22:20.417
there's this book
that you've got from the library.

263
00:22:20.583 --> 00:22:22.542
It's actually long overdue.

264
00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:25.583
Oh no.
What are they gonna do.

265
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:26.833
lock me up?

266
00:22:29.417 --> 00:22:30.500
Right.

267
00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:33.375
That's funny because
you're already locked up

268
00:22:33.542 --> 00:22:35.458
for trying to overthrow my father.

269
00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:38.750
Well. I always did have a problem
with authority.

270
00:22:38.917 --> 00:22:42.250
So. you're looking
for the Hamster of Darkness.

271
00:22:42.583 --> 00:22:43.583
are you?

272
00:22:45.042 --> 00:22:46.458
I don't think it's real.

273
00:22:46.625 --> 00:22:47.625
Really?

274
00:22:48.625 --> 00:22:51.542
Every time I've requested a book
on the topic of adventuring

275
00:22:51.708 --> 00:22:55.292
and it wasn't in.
it was because you had checked it out.

276
00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:58.500
Somebody's been doing
their homework.

277
00:22:58.667 --> 00:23:01.583
It's real. And we both know it.

278
00:23:02.042 --> 00:23:04.542
It'd be quite a feather
in your cap to bring back

279
00:23:04.708 --> 00:23:08.333
to the Royal Adventure Society.
wouldn't it?

280
00:23:09.042 --> 00:23:10.208
Maybe…

281
00:23:11.542 --> 00:23:12.917
Such a waste.

282
00:23:13.083 --> 00:23:15.625
You see. when I find
the Hamster of Darkness.

283
00:23:15.792 --> 00:23:18.583
I'm going to use it
to take over the kingdom.

284
00:23:21.208 --> 00:23:22.292
I'm just joking.

285
00:23:22.458 --> 00:23:25.083
Besides. I'm locked in this tower

286
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.125
that no one has ever escaped from.

287
00:23:28.292 --> 00:23:29.625
You think I've been waiting here.

288
00:23:29.792 --> 00:23:33.208
hoping you'd visit because you were
the final piece of my escape plan?

289
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.833
I wish I was that cunning.
But now…

290
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.833
let me find that book for you.

291
00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:43.167
Is this the one?

292
00:23:43.542 --> 00:23:45.625
Oh yeah. that's the one.

293
00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:48.792
So. if you'd just toss it on over here.

294
00:23:48.958 --> 00:23:52.750
I'll get out of your way
and you can go back

295
00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:55.750
to marking the days
on the wall with chalk.

296
00:23:56.125 --> 00:24:00.708
I'm afraid my time in here
has weakened me.

297
00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:03.042
Come over here.

298
00:24:03.625 --> 00:24:06.833
Why not just give it a little toss?

299
00:24:09.792 --> 00:24:11.208
On second thought.

300
00:24:11.542 --> 00:24:12.708
I'll come get it.

301
00:24:24.583 --> 00:24:26.917
Hold on.
I just remembered…

302
00:24:27.292 --> 00:24:28.500
I'm not done with it.

303
00:24:31.833 --> 00:24:34.042
Goodbye. Chickenhare.

304
00:24:34.208 --> 00:24:36.125
Don't forget your hat.

305
00:25:04.667 --> 00:25:05.875
Oh no…

306
00:25:11.917 --> 00:25:16.292
"Dear Brother.
enjoy your last days as king.

307
00:25:16.458 --> 00:25:18.292
"All the best. Lapin."

308
00:25:18.458 --> 00:25:20.125
I'm sorry. Dad.

309
00:25:20.292 --> 00:25:23.042
You know you're not allowed
to visit Lapin!

310
00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:24.500
What were you thinking?

311
00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:27.625
He had this book I needed
about the Hamster of Darkness.

312
00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:30.708
- See I figured…
- I told you to let it go.

313
00:25:31.792 --> 00:25:33.125
Sir. it's a map!

314
00:25:34.667 --> 00:25:37.083
"The Tomb of the Unknown Turtle"?

315
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.750
The ancient adventurer Frederic
the Extremely Short proposed that

316
00:25:41.083 --> 00:25:43.583
as one of the rumored locations
of the Hamster of Darkness.

317
00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:45.417
That's where Lapin's going.

318
00:25:45.583 --> 00:25:47.500
Ready my fastest boat.
We leave immediately.

319
00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:52.500
Dad. I know everything
about the Hamster of Darkness.

320
00:25:52.667 --> 00:25:53.792
Bring me along. I can help.

321
00:25:54.167 --> 00:25:56.833
No. You've done enough already.

322
00:26:21.167 --> 00:26:24.042
Hey. Boss. just came by
to see how you're doing.

323
00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:27.208
Other than letting the Kingdom's
most dangerous criminal escape.

324
00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:28.917
- I'm doing great.
- You are?

325
00:26:29.083 --> 00:26:32.208
- Look what was behind the bookshelf.
- An abstract painting?

326
00:26:32.833 --> 00:26:33.833
A map. Abe.

327
00:26:35.125 --> 00:26:37.667
Lapin's been obsessed
with the Hamster of Darkness.

328
00:26:37.833 --> 00:26:39.375
It doesn't make sense
that he'd think

329
00:26:39.542 --> 00:26:42.250
the Temple would be
at the Tomb of the Unknown Turtle.

330
00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:44.625
That's been searched so many times.

331
00:26:45.375 --> 00:26:47.208
It's a minute before 9.

332
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.042
something's missing.

333
00:26:49.542 --> 00:26:52.542
The moths are gonna be
the only ones to miss Lapin.

334
00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:54.083
It's winter.

335
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.833
There are no moths.

336
00:26:57.458 --> 00:26:58.917
It's the constellation!

337
00:26:59.708 --> 00:27:00.708
Coincidence.

338
00:27:00.875 --> 00:27:01.958
It's not. Abe.

339
00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:04.417
Lapin has been on his quest for years.

340
00:27:04.583 --> 00:27:07.375
It's not a blanket.
it's a curtain. give me that.

341
00:27:12.167 --> 00:27:14.250
You see. total coincidence.

342
00:27:14.542 --> 00:27:16.292
I'm not so sure.

343
00:27:16.708 --> 00:27:17.958
Let me clear the floor.

344
00:27:18.125 --> 00:27:19.333
Yes. that's it!

345
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.583
The book.

346
00:27:25.958 --> 00:27:29.000
"At the hour of 9
on a new day's dawn.

347
00:27:29.375 --> 00:27:31.083
"the constellation shall point

348
00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:34.250
"to The Temple
of the Hamster of Darkness."

349
00:27:56.042 --> 00:27:57.375
Bingo.

350
00:27:57.917 --> 00:28:01.042
Where's the "X"? Don't maps need
an "X" to mark the spot?

351
00:28:03.125 --> 00:28:05.250
Oh. darn tropes.

352
00:28:09.292 --> 00:28:10.958
Dad! Wait!

353
00:28:11.125 --> 00:28:13.000
You're going the wrong way!

354
00:28:16.417 --> 00:28:18.208
We need to get a boat ready.

355
00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:21.292
We have to beat Lapin
to the Hamster of Darkness.

356
00:28:21.458 --> 00:28:24.667
Oh no. forget about it.
I am not an adventurer.

357
00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:27.625
And you're…
How do I put this delicately?

358
00:28:27.792 --> 00:28:29.458
You're… you.

359
00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:31.417
Maybe I'm not much of an adventurer.

360
00:28:31.583 --> 00:28:33.958
but we're the only ones
who can do this now.

361
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.750
And if we don't.

362
00:28:35.917 --> 00:28:38.625
Lapin's gonna come back
and take over the Kingdom.

363
00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:41.167
Well. unemployment is kinda high.

364
00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:43.667
And your dad's been king for what?
15 years?

365
00:28:43.833 --> 00:28:46.250
This is serious. Abe.
And it's all my fault.

366
00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:49.167
Not all. Only like 90%.

367
00:28:49.417 --> 00:28:51.708
I'm going.
And I want you to come with me.

368
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.708
I'm your royal servant.
I'm legally bound to go with you.

369
00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:58.833
No. I'm not asking as your master.

370
00:28:59.292 --> 00:29:01.042
I'm asking you as a friend.

371
00:29:01.208 --> 00:29:02.875
That makes it an easy decision.

372
00:29:05.458 --> 00:29:08.792
Actually. that makes it
an incredibly difficult decision.

373
00:29:08.958 --> 00:29:10.500
Can you be friends with your boss?

374
00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:14.500
Isn't the relationship completely skewed
by the power dynamic?

375
00:29:14.667 --> 00:29:15.667
What?

376
00:29:15.833 --> 00:29:17.458
These are deep questions.

377
00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:20.417
I. for one. find them
intellectually invigorating.

378
00:29:20.583 --> 00:29:22.333
Wait. wait.

379
00:29:22.708 --> 00:29:24.083
Actually. I'm sorry.
keep going.

380
00:29:24.958 --> 00:29:25.958
Wait.

381
00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:28.667
I'm coming…

382
00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:30.042
friend.

383
00:29:30.208 --> 00:29:32.833
But be prepared
for a lot of "I told you so's."

384
00:29:39.458 --> 00:29:44.000
<i>I have been at sea</i>
<i>for 12 long minutes.</i>

385
00:29:44.167 --> 00:29:46.000
<i>The heat is unbearable.</i>

386
00:29:46.333 --> 00:29:48.667
<i>Thirst is a constant companion.</i>

387
00:29:48.833 --> 00:29:50.458
<i>And as for hunger.</i>

388
00:29:50.625 --> 00:29:54.667
<i>I may be developing</i>
<i>a taste for chicken and hare.</i>

389
00:29:59.208 --> 00:30:00.917
Not too late to turn around.

390
00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:03.125
I always wanted an adventure.

391
00:30:03.292 --> 00:30:05.750
I just hope we can pull it off.

392
00:30:05.917 --> 00:30:07.167
I'm sure we will.

393
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.250
<i>I have no confidence</i>
<i>in our chances.</i>

394
00:30:13.417 --> 00:30:16.542
<i>If you're reading this.</i>
<i>that means I've either been crushed.</i>

395
00:30:16.708 --> 00:30:19.417
<i>impaled. pole-axed. harpooned.</i>

396
00:30:19.583 --> 00:30:22.125
<i>eaten alive by carnivorous beetles.</i>

397
00:30:22.292 --> 00:30:24.667
<i>drowned in a sea full of sharks.</i>

398
00:30:24.833 --> 00:30:28.500
<i>killed by birds</i>
<i>pecking at my every being.</i>

399
00:30:42.417 --> 00:30:44.083
So. so parched.

400
00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:49.583
Water?

401
00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.542
Oh. that goes down nice.
Oh yeah.

402
00:30:53.708 --> 00:30:54.917
So. parched.

403
00:30:55.667 --> 00:30:57.542
That jet stream gets me every time.

404
00:30:57.708 --> 00:30:58.792
Well?

405
00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:00.667
Huh? Oh. yeah uh…

406
00:31:00.833 --> 00:31:03.792
The King took the bait.
Everything's going like we planned.

407
00:31:03.958 --> 00:31:05.167
Like <i>we</i> planned?

408
00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:06.750
Well. yeah. okay.

409
00:31:06.917 --> 00:31:10.417
Technically it was your plan.
but I agreed it was a great plan.

410
00:31:11.167 --> 00:31:13.208
No. it's the perfect plan.

411
00:31:13.708 --> 00:31:16.500
- Well. not quite perfect.
- What?

412
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.250
It's your nephew.

413
00:31:18.417 --> 00:31:19.417
The freak?

414
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.792
He knows where the hamster is.

415
00:31:21.958 --> 00:31:25.375
And he and his little turtle friend
are following us.

416
00:31:25.542 --> 00:31:27.750
Hey. I figured we could wait for them.

417
00:31:27.917 --> 00:31:31.750
then flank them
and engage them in a nautical battle.

418
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.042
I've always wanted
to be in a nautical battle.

419
00:31:35.375 --> 00:31:39.292
Please remember you're here
because of your wings. not your brain.

420
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.083
I cannot waste valuable time
on the off chance

421
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:45.208
that the freak actually makes it
across the ocean.

422
00:31:46.167 --> 00:31:47.292
No.

423
00:31:47.583 --> 00:31:50.083
we'll subcontract this one out.

424
00:31:50.583 --> 00:31:54.833
And I have just the animal
for the job.

425
00:31:57.542 --> 00:31:58.667
<i>Luther.</i>

426
00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:01.167
<i>the last member of our team.</i>

427
00:32:01.542 --> 00:32:03.500
<i>The most ruthless animal</i>

428
00:32:03.667 --> 00:32:05.917
<i>I've ever had the pleasure</i>
<i>of working with.</i>

429
00:32:06.083 --> 00:32:07.083
<i>He's so mean.</i>

430
00:32:07.833 --> 00:32:09.833
<i>he once killed an animal</i>

431
00:32:10.083 --> 00:32:11.750
<i>just for snoring.</i>

432
00:32:13.833 --> 00:32:16.625
I have sleep apnea.

433
00:32:17.625 --> 00:32:18.708
It's pretty bad.

434
00:32:18.875 --> 00:32:20.458
Can we get separate rooms?

435
00:32:21.417 --> 00:32:24.417
Lapin. it's been too long.

436
00:32:27.167 --> 00:32:28.958
It's okay. little guy…

437
00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:54.000
This city is where Alexander the Sweaty
discovered the Mustache of Destiny.

438
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.333
Isn't this place great?

439
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:01.125
Yeah. Great place to get murdered.
Why are we here anyway?

440
00:33:01.292 --> 00:33:02.458
Follow me.

441
00:33:04.458 --> 00:33:05.958
This very tavern

442
00:33:06.125 --> 00:33:09.417
is where Hector the Lost
hired the legless sherpa

443
00:33:09.583 --> 00:33:11.583
who led him to the Atheist's Temple.

444
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.458
I never thought I'd see it
with my own eyes.

445
00:33:14.625 --> 00:33:17.333
I think you and I have
very different bucket lists.

446
00:33:20.792 --> 00:33:23.333
With any luck.
this is where we'll find our guide.

447
00:33:23.708 --> 00:33:25.708
Or at least a communicable disease.

448
00:33:25.875 --> 00:33:27.625
Hey. You need a guide?

449
00:33:28.083 --> 00:33:29.417
I'm your gal.

450
00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:32.458
I know that jungle
like the back of my tail. And the front.

451
00:33:32.625 --> 00:33:35.125
Don't do it. kid. She's bad news.

452
00:33:35.292 --> 00:33:37.792
Only a fool without a snout
would hire a skunk.

453
00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:39.958
The guy you want's over there.

454
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.000
Excuse me?

455
00:33:48.417 --> 00:33:49.792
I'm looking for a guide.

456
00:33:50.333 --> 00:33:53.125
Well. fellow hare.

457
00:33:53.292 --> 00:33:54.917
you've come to the right rat.

458
00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:58.792
The name's Rusty.
but my sense of direction's not.

459
00:33:59.167 --> 00:34:02.792
Come on. let's go talk in the back.
away from prying ears.

460
00:34:02.958 --> 00:34:05.333
Yup.
I think we can totally trust this guy.

461
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.292
Not suspicious at all.

462
00:34:12.875 --> 00:34:16.375
- So Rusty. we gotta go to…
- I already know where you're going.

463
00:34:16.875 --> 00:34:18.042
You do?

464
00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:20.750
Wow.
No wonder you're a guide.

465
00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:22.792
You're going with him.

466
00:34:28.417 --> 00:34:29.833
He's joking. right?

467
00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:36.583
Please tell me we've stumbled
into a very messed-up daycare.

468
00:34:37.333 --> 00:34:38.625
Rusty?

469
00:34:38.792 --> 00:34:39.958
Is this guide humor?

470
00:34:40.125 --> 00:34:44.208
You didn't tell me this guy was looking
for the Hamster of Darkness.

471
00:34:45.958 --> 00:34:47.750
You lose your manners
along with that eye?

472
00:34:48.458 --> 00:34:50.250
Stay out of this skunk!

473
00:34:50.625 --> 00:34:52.750
Yeah. it's me.
I'm Meg by the way.

474
00:34:52.917 --> 00:34:56.083
I don't care.
Now give me that map.

475
00:34:56.375 --> 00:34:59.042
Over our dead bodies.

476
00:34:59.208 --> 00:35:01.250
So. Mr. Gorilla. just to be clear.

477
00:35:01.417 --> 00:35:04.458
Meg was speaking metaphorically
about the dead bodies thing.

478
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.708
He's a literalist.

479
00:35:16.417 --> 00:35:17.500
Take this!

480
00:35:17.667 --> 00:35:20.000
Yeah. my kind of girl!

481
00:35:24.833 --> 00:35:26.708
We're in a bar fight. Abe!

482
00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:38.792
Our map! He's getting away.

483
00:35:38.958 --> 00:35:40.292
Or not.

484
00:35:42.625 --> 00:35:45.625
Yeah. come on.
is that all you got?

485
00:35:58.292 --> 00:35:59.958
Meg. you're amazing.

486
00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:03.208
I'm assuming you're not going
with Rusty as your guide.

487
00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:05.542
You know.
because of the whole betrayal thing.

488
00:36:05.708 --> 00:36:07.083
You're hired!

489
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.125
This should probably be a lesson.
don't judge a book by its cover.

490
00:36:11.292 --> 00:36:13.917
'cause you might end up
reading a really bad book.

491
00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:25.208
I'm really. really sorry.

492
00:36:25.375 --> 00:36:27.167
Meg? We've got a problem…

493
00:36:27.333 --> 00:36:29.042
And I've got the solution.

494
00:36:29.208 --> 00:36:30.792
Guys. put these on.

495
00:36:32.542 --> 00:36:33.667
Now.

496
00:36:41.958 --> 00:36:43.167
What a blast!

497
00:36:43.333 --> 00:36:45.792
I'm gonna keep this if that's okay.

498
00:36:48.917 --> 00:36:52.667
Oh darn.
I need to change your diaper.

499
00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:01.333
Hold up. This sweat is chaffing me
like there's no tomorrow…

500
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.292
Which there probably isn't.

501
00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:08.125
That's better.

502
00:37:11.375 --> 00:37:14.042
A little hot in that jacket?

503
00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:17.583
Not at all.
I'm actually a little cold.

504
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.917
Okay… So. I know
we haven't talked compensation.

505
00:37:21.083 --> 00:37:22.875
but I have a proposal.

506
00:37:23.042 --> 00:37:26.167
I'll take you to wherever
you wanna go for free.

507
00:37:26.583 --> 00:37:27.708
What's the catch?

508
00:37:27.875 --> 00:37:30.167
I've been on a fair number
of adventures myself.

509
00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:33.750
exclusively solo expeditions.
you know. 'cause of the skunk thing.

510
00:37:34.417 --> 00:37:37.708
And the truth is.
it's been kind of lonely.

511
00:37:43.542 --> 00:37:47.500
Meg. you can stay
with us as long as you like.

512
00:37:47.917 --> 00:37:49.042
- Really?
- Really?

513
00:37:49.208 --> 00:37:51.750
You are not going to regret this.
No sirree.

514
00:37:51.917 --> 00:37:55.125
I gotta say. I think we're on the cusp
of something great here.

515
00:37:55.292 --> 00:37:58.167
Something epic.
something unprecedented.

516
00:38:00.792 --> 00:38:03.875
Hamster of Darkness.
That's the Big One.

517
00:38:04.042 --> 00:38:06.667
When we find it.
they'll put us on the cover

518
00:38:06.833 --> 00:38:09.667
of <i>Adventure Weekly</i>
and <i>Adventure Monthly</i>.

519
00:38:11.542 --> 00:38:13.958
And Chickenhare.
if they put your name first.

520
00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:17.667
I'm totally fine with that.
just happy to be part of the team.

521
00:38:17.833 --> 00:38:20.458
You think she brought anything
to plug my ears?

522
00:38:22.292 --> 00:38:24.583
Hey. what kind of name
is Chickenhare anyway?

523
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.542
Is that part Yukinarian?

524
00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.083
I actually don't know.

525
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:33.000
Really? No clue?
Because it is such a unique name.

526
00:38:33.167 --> 00:38:35.250
Well. it's very unusual.

527
00:38:35.417 --> 00:38:38.167
Because I see the hare.
but I don't see the chicken.

528
00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:41.042
I'm gonna figure this out.
I'm great at puzzles.

529
00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:52.167
Well. that's too bad.
Looks like we'll have to head back.

530
00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:54.500
Follow me.

531
00:38:57.167 --> 00:38:58.333
Your turn.

532
00:38:59.958 --> 00:39:01.083
Why can't I meet anyone

533
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.542
who shares my pessimism?

534
00:39:06.167 --> 00:39:10.167
If you take off that jacket.
it might help with your follow-through.

535
00:39:10.333 --> 00:39:13.250
Just a suggestion.
What do I know. I'm just a skunk. right?

536
00:39:13.625 --> 00:39:16.958
No. no. I'm good!
Third time's a charm!

537
00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:21.875
Now what?

538
00:39:24.125 --> 00:39:26.083
Stay put and don't try
anything foolish.

539
00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:36.708
I expected more from you. Luther.

540
00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:39.833
I won't tolerate another mistake.

541
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.375
And why is this thing even here.

542
00:39:43.542 --> 00:39:47.042
why isn't he at home with your wife?
What has happened to you?

543
00:39:47.208 --> 00:39:49.875
See. Lapin.
me and my wife have 2-3 jobs.

544
00:39:50.042 --> 00:39:52.417
It's hard. you know.
providing for the baby.

545
00:39:52.583 --> 00:39:55.708
See. I can't afford
the cost of diapers and…

546
00:39:55.875 --> 00:39:56.875
Enough!

547
00:39:57.042 --> 00:40:01.542
Has the entire criminal underworld
gone soft since I've been locked up?

548
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.708
Do me a favor.
go back to your wife.

549
00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:08.708
Go!

550
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.833
Oh good. the duck's back.

551
00:40:14.375 --> 00:40:16.500
Please tell me
something positive.

552
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.125
Chickenhare made it through
the Desert of Death.

553
00:40:19.542 --> 00:40:21.125
What? Impossible!

554
00:40:21.458 --> 00:40:24.750
Well. technically improbable
since he did make it through.

555
00:40:24.917 --> 00:40:26.583
He's just a couple clicks behind us.

556
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.250
What are clicks?

557
00:40:28.417 --> 00:40:32.375
I hear that term on missions like this.
but I don't know what they are.

558
00:40:32.542 --> 00:40:34.458
Destroy the bridge.

559
00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:37.292
It will take them a week
to get around the quicksand.

560
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.958
By then. I'll have Featherbeard
completely under my control.

561
00:40:43.917 --> 00:40:46.250
Our control.

562
00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:49.917
Your control… obviously.

563
00:41:02.917 --> 00:41:06.292
We'll have to go around.
that's gonna take at least a week.

564
00:41:06.458 --> 00:41:07.917
We don't have a week.

565
00:41:08.083 --> 00:41:11.000
My Uncle Lapin'll already have
the hamster by then.

566
00:41:11.167 --> 00:41:12.208
We can cross it.

567
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:15.833
Sure. for a couple of feet.
But then we'd die!

568
00:41:16.417 --> 00:41:19.958
Because this is quicksand!
Quicksand sucks you under until you die!

569
00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:22.583
That's what it does!
That's its reason for existing!

570
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:27.000
Chickenhare is right. we should try.
The quicksand is only in a few spots.

571
00:41:27.167 --> 00:41:29.583
If we avoid those spots.
we'll have a solid path.

572
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.000
Do you know where that path is?

573
00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:34.333
Just follow in my footsteps
and you'll be okay.

574
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.125
I'll go last.

575
00:41:40.958 --> 00:41:42.708
Who's this Uncle Lapin?

576
00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:45.208
He's just a genius adventurer

577
00:41:45.375 --> 00:41:50.625
with grandiose plans most likely
covering a deep-seeded insecurity.

578
00:41:50.792 --> 00:41:53.583
Sounds like someone else I know.

579
00:41:54.458 --> 00:41:56.208
- Chickenhare!
- Oh no!

580
00:41:56.375 --> 00:41:58.250
- Chickenhare!
- Abe. help!

581
00:41:58.625 --> 00:42:01.792
Grab onto me.
Darn. I'm a goner too.

582
00:42:01.958 --> 00:42:03.208
Hey. watch the shell!

583
00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:05.000
Hold on. Chickenhare.

584
00:42:09.208 --> 00:42:10.208
Meg!

585
00:42:10.375 --> 00:42:11.792
I'm going down!

586
00:42:11.958 --> 00:42:13.708
Stay still. don't move.

587
00:42:23.292 --> 00:42:24.500
What are you doing?

588
00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:26.125
Grab the whip!

589
00:42:26.542 --> 00:42:28.917
With your hands!
Isn't that kind of implied?

590
00:42:30.542 --> 00:42:31.542
Just pull!

591
00:42:33.167 --> 00:42:35.292
A little help. Abe!
Hurry!

592
00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:39.250
You need to use your hands!

593
00:42:39.792 --> 00:42:42.958
Isn't it a pretty simple concept
he's failing to grasp? Abe!

594
00:42:53.625 --> 00:42:56.333
Oh. my gosh!
I'm pulling him out of his skin!

595
00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:08.125
Wait. are those… chicken legs?

596
00:43:10.333 --> 00:43:13.667
Hold on a second.
Chickenhare… Oh. lightning bolt!

597
00:43:13.833 --> 00:43:16.000
That's where the name
comes from!

598
00:43:16.167 --> 00:43:19.208
Told you I was great at puzzles!
Those are chicken feet.

599
00:43:20.042 --> 00:43:22.833
You're part chicken. part hare.
aren't you?

600
00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:27.292
Hello. what about me?

601
00:43:27.458 --> 00:43:30.667
Hey. a little help here. guys.
I'm stuck.

602
00:43:37.417 --> 00:43:39.500
- Do you have other chicken parts?
- No.

603
00:43:43.625 --> 00:43:44.625
Hey!

604
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.417
That is… awesome!

605
00:43:47.292 --> 00:43:49.750
What else?
Do you have wings?

606
00:43:50.417 --> 00:43:52.125
You have wings under that jacket!

607
00:43:52.292 --> 00:43:56.167
Nope. You've seen the top-shelf stuff.
He has a couple feathers under there.

608
00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:58.375
- Lemme see 'em.
- No!

609
00:43:58.792 --> 00:44:01.542
- Are there other chickenhares?
- Not that I know of.

610
00:44:01.708 --> 00:44:04.917
You're your own species!
How awesome is that?

611
00:44:05.083 --> 00:44:07.042
You're basically
automatically endangered.

612
00:44:07.208 --> 00:44:10.042
- It's not awesome!
- So like what you can do?

613
00:44:10.208 --> 00:44:11.958
Oh my gosh. you can fly!

614
00:44:12.125 --> 00:44:15.000
I can't fly.
Chickens can't even fly.

615
00:44:15.167 --> 00:44:17.667
Technically they can over
very short distances.

616
00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:20.208
Oh come on.
but you're only part chicken.

617
00:44:20.375 --> 00:44:22.500
How many flying hares
have you ever seen?

618
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.583
Well. none.

619
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:28.375
But I've also never seen a hare
with such gigantic floppy ears.

620
00:44:28.542 --> 00:44:31.458
- I mean. on an elephant.
- I can't fly!

621
00:44:32.583 --> 00:44:34.667
You can fly!

622
00:44:40.042 --> 00:44:42.083
See. I can't fly.

623
00:44:42.625 --> 00:44:45.250
I can't clear a bar
with my scent like you Meg.

624
00:44:45.708 --> 00:44:48.958
There's nothing good
about being me. okay?

625
00:44:49.667 --> 00:44:52.125
You've got a "me" problem.

626
00:44:55.375 --> 00:44:57.625
I think we got a "we" problem.

627
00:44:58.875 --> 00:44:59.875
Oh no!

628
00:45:43.292 --> 00:45:44.625
Pigmies?

629
00:45:48.042 --> 00:45:50.625
Heya! We come in peace.

630
00:45:50.792 --> 00:45:53.042
For the record.
I didn't wanna come at all.

631
00:45:53.208 --> 00:45:54.667
Blast 'em. Blast 'em all.

632
00:45:54.833 --> 00:45:57.417
Hold on. I can't.
I haven't recharged yet.

633
00:45:57.583 --> 00:46:00.500
"Haven't recharged!"
What happened to being special?

634
00:46:05.125 --> 00:46:07.542
Hey! That tickles!

635
00:46:09.167 --> 00:46:10.500
Behold!

636
00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:12.542
The Chickenhare!

637
00:46:12.708 --> 00:46:15.000
God of the land and sky!

638
00:46:15.292 --> 00:46:17.750
Flyer over short distances!

639
00:46:18.542 --> 00:46:20.917
Part chicken. part hare.

640
00:46:21.083 --> 00:46:22.667
Almighty!

641
00:46:39.333 --> 00:46:42.333
You are a god?

642
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.083
Sure?

643
00:46:45.625 --> 00:46:47.625
That's good enough for me.

644
00:46:47.792 --> 00:46:50.042
Prepare the feast!

645
00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:52.125
See. "me" problem.

646
00:46:52.292 --> 00:46:53.375
Tonight.

647
00:46:53.542 --> 00:46:57.167
we shall ply
the almighty Chickenhare

648
00:46:57.333 --> 00:46:59.917
and his strange helpers

649
00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:02.958
with our finest banquet!

650
00:47:04.292 --> 00:47:07.917
And then. tomorrow at first light.

651
00:47:08.083 --> 00:47:10.458
we shall take them to our volcano.

652
00:47:11.625 --> 00:47:14.833
and sacrifice the god Chickenhare

653
00:47:15.083 --> 00:47:19.125
to our god…
Santoro the Stoic!

654
00:47:19.292 --> 00:47:21.542
I think you're just the thing

655
00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:26.500
to finally put a smile
on Santoro's face.

656
00:47:26.667 --> 00:47:27.917
Just to be clear.

657
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.625
Chickenhare's the only one
going in the volcano. right?

658
00:47:45.958 --> 00:47:47.500
That meal was incredible.

659
00:47:47.667 --> 00:47:49.708
These guys know how
to throw a sacrifice.

660
00:47:50.125 --> 00:47:53.875
See. Meg. this is what happens
when I'm myself.

661
00:47:54.042 --> 00:47:56.583
Maybe we could take a break
from the pity party?

662
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:59.292
Let me tell you
about a little skunk named…

663
00:47:59.458 --> 00:48:01.083
I don't know… "Peg."

664
00:48:01.625 --> 00:48:05.625
I love a good story.
especially after a meal like that.

665
00:48:05.958 --> 00:48:08.708
Growing up. nobody wanted
to have a play date with "Peg."

666
00:48:08.875 --> 00:48:10.667
on account of her being a skunk.

667
00:48:10.833 --> 00:48:14.958
Even when she got cool new dolls.
and had goody bags for her birthday.

668
00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.792
<i>nobody came.</i>

669
00:48:16.958 --> 00:48:19.250
<i>She bathed twice a day.</i>
<i>didn't matter.</i>

670
00:48:19.417 --> 00:48:22.125
<i>So… she corked herself.</i>

671
00:48:22.292 --> 00:48:23.958
Ouch!

672
00:48:24.292 --> 00:48:25.875
Ouch is right.

673
00:48:26.292 --> 00:48:27.875
But that didn't work either.

674
00:48:28.042 --> 00:48:31.000
So naturally. "Peg" got angry…

675
00:48:31.167 --> 00:48:34.125
<i>Her parents wanted her anger channeled</i>
<i>into something positive.</i>

676
00:48:34.292 --> 00:48:36.500
<i>So. she got a black belt in karate…</i>

677
00:48:36.667 --> 00:48:38.083
<i>and Kung Fu…</i>

678
00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:39.667
<i>and Kendo…</i>

679
00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:41.958
<i>and seven other martial arts.</i>

680
00:48:42.125 --> 00:48:45.542
<i>But that didn't help either.</i>
<i>She was still angry.</i>

681
00:48:45.958 --> 00:48:49.833
<i>Deep down. "Peg" still wished</i>
<i>she was anything but a skunk.</i>

682
00:48:50.167 --> 00:48:53.583
<i>Until one day. when she went</i>
<i>on a field trip to the Royal Treasury.</i>

683
00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:59.083
<i>and then Billy Goat Jones.</i>
<i>the jerk who teased "Peg" the most.</i>

684
00:48:59.708 --> 00:49:01.417
<i>shut the door behind us.</i>

685
00:49:01.833 --> 00:49:04.583
<i>But the treasurer was</i>
<i>the only one with the combination.</i>

686
00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:07.292
<i>Know what happens</i>
<i>when a skunk fears for her life?</i>

687
00:49:07.458 --> 00:49:10.333
<i>Well. "Peg" was a skunk</i>
<i>who feared for her life</i>

688
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.458
<i>and had been corked for 3 years.</i>

689
00:49:15.333 --> 00:49:17.292
<i>"Peg" saved everyone that day.</i>

690
00:49:17.458 --> 00:49:20.375
<i>And you were a big hero</i>
<i>and everyone loved you. Meg.</i>

691
00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:22.833
<i>I mean "Peg".</i>

692
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
<i>No. they treated me worse than ever.</i>

693
00:49:26.167 --> 00:49:29.042
But for the first time.
I didn't care.

694
00:49:29.208 --> 00:49:33.417
I realized the thing that I was corking.
wasn't something to be ashamed of.

695
00:49:33.583 --> 00:49:35.792
No. it's what made me special.

696
00:49:36.333 --> 00:49:39.000
Chickenhare. you're a corker.

697
00:49:39.167 --> 00:49:43.542
Until you blow open your treasury vault.
you won't know what makes you special.

698
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.333
Nice story. Meg.

699
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.500
and I liked the way
you changed your name

700
00:49:48.667 --> 00:49:50.583
to make it feel more universal.

701
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:52.917
But when the volcano turns us to ash.

702
00:49:53.083 --> 00:49:56.792
it isn't gonna discriminate
between the corkers and the non-corkers.

703
00:49:56.958 --> 00:50:00.167
True. But they're not gonna
throw us in that volcano.

704
00:50:01.583 --> 00:50:03.667
- They're not?
- Nope.

705
00:50:03.833 --> 00:50:05.750
Because you're gonna break us out.

706
00:50:11.625 --> 00:50:14.292
- Are you sure about this?
- Trust me.

707
00:51:03.333 --> 00:51:04.333
Chickenhare.

708
00:51:11.125 --> 00:51:12.708
I'll be right back.

709
00:51:13.292 --> 00:51:14.292
No.

710
00:51:20.667 --> 00:51:21.667
Really?

711
00:51:33.375 --> 00:51:35.500
Chickenhare. don't.

712
00:51:41.125 --> 00:51:42.958
You don't need those.

713
00:52:27.333 --> 00:52:28.792
Well. you know.

714
00:52:28.958 --> 00:52:33.375
I always felt waiting
'til first light was a bit arbitrary.

715
00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.333
Take them to the volcano now!

716
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.667
Put down your weapons.

717
00:52:36.833 --> 00:52:38.708
or your god gets it!

718
00:52:39.625 --> 00:52:40.625
Abe?

719
00:52:41.333 --> 00:52:42.958
Come on. guys. hurry up.

720
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:47.250
Look how Santoro maintains his stoicism.

721
00:52:47.833 --> 00:52:50.792
even with a spear at his throat.

722
00:52:50.958 --> 00:52:55.208
Let's see how he maintains
his stoicism rolling down a hill!

723
00:52:55.542 --> 00:52:58.458
Now they'll all follow him
as we make our escape…

724
00:53:03.333 --> 00:53:05.625
- Or not.
- Get them!

725
00:53:09.708 --> 00:53:11.375
Oh great Santoro.

726
00:53:11.542 --> 00:53:14.667
your revenge is at hand!

727
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.750
Watch out!

728
00:53:24.083 --> 00:53:26.667
This is not worth
perpetual three-day weekends!

729
00:53:29.708 --> 00:53:30.708
No. come here!

730
00:53:54.333 --> 00:53:56.958
- Please tell me you've recharged!
- I'm trying!

731
00:53:57.125 --> 00:53:58.625
Almost there.

732
00:54:04.083 --> 00:54:06.625
I'm really starting to think
you're not special at all.

733
00:54:06.792 --> 00:54:08.167
you just have an enormous ego!

734
00:54:08.458 --> 00:54:10.333
There we go. I'm back.

735
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.708
Fire in the hole!

736
00:54:23.458 --> 00:54:24.833
Chickenhare!

737
00:54:38.542 --> 00:54:41.000
- Chickenhare! This way!
- Coming!

738
00:54:58.625 --> 00:55:00.750
Chickenhare!
Your moves have moves.

739
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.083
Good work. Chickenhare.

740
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:20.250
Did you see that?

741
00:55:25.208 --> 00:55:26.208
Let's go.

742
00:55:29.625 --> 00:55:30.667
Look!

743
00:55:30.833 --> 00:55:33.333
Woah. the mountain!

744
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.042
Incoming!

745
00:55:48.875 --> 00:55:51.250
- Meg. get us across!
- I can't do it.

746
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:53.500
I can't do it.
Last time I tried…

747
00:55:53.667 --> 00:55:56.250
Last time your jacket
was holding your arm back.

748
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.208
You're almost here. Chickenhare.

749
00:56:03.625 --> 00:56:05.833
- I did it! Hang on!
- Here we go!

750
00:56:09.958 --> 00:56:10.958
Oh. please.

751
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:12.875
No!

752
00:56:14.958 --> 00:56:17.125
You couldn't have brought
the extra-large whip.

753
00:56:17.292 --> 00:56:18.625
could you. Meg?

754
00:56:20.125 --> 00:56:21.500
I hate adventuring!

755
00:56:25.417 --> 00:56:27.500
Hey! It's even further than I thought.

756
00:56:46.583 --> 00:56:49.958
According to the map.
the temple's at the top of the mountain.

757
00:56:50.125 --> 00:56:51.125
We need a plan.

758
00:56:51.292 --> 00:56:53.542
Lapin is probably
halfway up there already.

759
00:56:53.708 --> 00:56:54.750
I have a plan!

760
00:56:55.083 --> 00:56:57.125
If we take the Nearly Impassable Pass.

761
00:56:57.583 --> 00:57:00.708
by the time the trails merge.
we should be ahead of them…

762
00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:02.708
Sounds like a genius plan to me.

763
00:57:02.875 --> 00:57:05.917
You know what? We might get
that Hamster of Darkness after all.

764
00:57:06.083 --> 00:57:10.333
What do you mean "might"?
Lapin's gonna eat our feather dust.

765
00:57:11.708 --> 00:57:12.708
Abe?

766
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.500
This mud is actually very nutrient-rich.

767
00:57:17.083 --> 00:57:18.542
Uh. let's go.

768
00:57:18.708 --> 00:57:21.583
Hey. I wanna stop Lapin
as much as you.

769
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:23.583
well maybe 10% as much as you.

770
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:26.042
but can't we look good doing it?

771
00:57:47.042 --> 00:57:49.083
Here I am. You won't believe it.

772
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:52.500
Chickenhare's heading up
the Nearly Impassable Pass!

773
00:57:52.667 --> 00:57:54.250
What? Impossible!

774
00:57:54.583 --> 00:57:58.000
No. again I think
it's more improbable than impossible.

775
00:57:58.167 --> 00:58:00.667
You know. I tell you what.
the way he's going.

776
00:58:01.167 --> 00:58:04.667
the Three Deadly Trials
won't be a problem for Chickenhare.

777
00:58:09.583 --> 00:58:11.500
Get the dynamite.

778
00:58:12.333 --> 00:58:13.458
Come on. Abe!

779
00:58:14.542 --> 00:58:16.083
We're closing in on them.

780
00:58:16.375 --> 00:58:17.625
Hello. I'm a turtle!

781
00:58:17.792 --> 00:58:21.500
Are you completely unaware
of my species' role in fables?

782
00:58:28.167 --> 00:58:29.167
You idiots!

783
00:58:29.333 --> 00:58:33.208
The avalanche was supposed
to take out Chickenhare. not us!

784
00:58:38.125 --> 00:58:40.833
It really is difficult
to find good help these days.

785
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:43.833
Lapin!

786
00:58:44.333 --> 00:58:45.667
Lapin!

787
00:58:45.833 --> 00:58:47.458
Look. Lapin's a goner.

788
00:58:49.667 --> 00:58:51.750
I guess there's nothing we can do.

789
00:58:51.917 --> 00:58:52.917
Yeah there is.

790
00:58:56.875 --> 00:58:58.417
You're right.
nothing we can do.

791
00:58:58.583 --> 00:58:59.833
Oh. let's go.

792
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.417
Sorry. guys.

793
00:59:13.375 --> 00:59:15.083
According to the legend.

794
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:19.042
we're looking for a hamster face
etched in the ice.

795
00:59:33.708 --> 00:59:34.958
I got it!

796
00:59:36.375 --> 00:59:37.583
This way!

797
00:59:47.333 --> 00:59:49.333
Alright. we're going in.

798
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.208
You read my mind. partner.

799
00:59:51.417 --> 00:59:53.958
Wait. Lapin's dead and buried.

800
00:59:54.125 --> 00:59:55.833
Probably not in that order.

801
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.792
We saved the Kingdom.
We're done here. Let's go home.

802
00:59:58.958 --> 01:00:02.292
Abe. if I can bring back
the Hamster of Darkness.

803
01:00:02.458 --> 01:00:05.167
my dad will let me join
the Royal Adventure Society.

804
01:00:05.542 --> 01:00:07.583
Isn't it enough
that you made it this far?

805
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.542
And who's gonna believe me?

806
01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:12.167
I need the hamster as proof.

807
01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:15.042
Now the only thing
standing between us and it

808
01:00:15.208 --> 01:00:17.042
are the Three Deadly Trials.

809
01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:19.458
Abe. if you wanna stay behind.
fine. but…

810
01:00:19.875 --> 01:00:21.125
I'm in!

811
01:00:26.542 --> 01:00:28.583
I've always been a follower.

812
01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:32.000
I want every other Thursday off too!

813
01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:41.167
"In order to enter
the Temple of the Hamster of Darkness.

814
01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:44.250
"one must pass the Three Deadly Trials."

815
01:00:44.417 --> 01:00:48.375
Why's it always three?
Why can't it ever be two trials?

816
01:00:51.708 --> 01:00:53.042
What's the first one?

817
01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:55.750
"We hamsters may be small of stature.

818
01:00:55.917 --> 01:00:57.875
"but we are cool under pressure.

819
01:00:58.042 --> 01:00:59.250
"We never lose our heads.

820
01:01:01.375 --> 01:01:04.583
"even when confronted
by imminent death."

821
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:07.500
"Imminent death!"
That's how we start?

822
01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:13.375
Sadistic little rodents. aren't they?

823
01:01:19.917 --> 01:01:21.375
"Small of stature"…

824
01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:28.875
"Cool under pressure"…

825
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:41.833
A secret passage!

826
01:01:42.292 --> 01:01:44.292
- Well done!
- Let's get out of here!

827
01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:59.042
What's the second trial?

828
01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:04.250
"Though we hamsters may not be so fleet
of foot to outrun our Destiny.

829
01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:07.042
"we do have the courage to face it."

830
01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:10.125
Enough with this fake
self-deprecating routine.

831
01:02:10.292 --> 01:02:13.042
Why couldn't these hamsters
hire shrinks like us?

832
01:02:19.917 --> 01:02:21.458
Run!

833
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.500
Look. that's Ramon's wife!

834
01:02:30.667 --> 01:02:33.667
It's wonderful that you're an admirer
of the female form…

835
01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:37.125
His wife Destiny.
We have to stand here facing Destiny.

836
01:02:38.083 --> 01:02:39.583
Or… we can run!

837
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:42.625
Meg. if you're gonna side with me
once before I die.

838
01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.458
you have 10 seconds.
9…

839
01:02:44.625 --> 01:02:45.625
I'm with Chickenhare.

840
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:49.958
Miscalculated!
7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1…

841
01:03:29.208 --> 01:03:31.792
Think these hamsters
had issues with being short?

842
01:03:32.125 --> 01:03:34.875
Do I even wanna ask
what the third trial is?

843
01:03:35.167 --> 01:03:37.458
All the legend says. is:
"Do this."

844
01:03:37.625 --> 01:03:38.625
Do what?

845
01:03:48.708 --> 01:03:50.875
That can't be it. Could it?

846
01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:31.292
Man. these hamsters
keep you off-balance.

847
01:04:42.792 --> 01:04:44.167
The scepter…

848
01:04:47.208 --> 01:04:48.208
We made it!

849
01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:03.792
I'm taking you home.

850
01:05:15.167 --> 01:05:17.917
The Hamster of Darkness.

851
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.708
- But you…
- Were buried in that avalanche?

852
01:05:23.875 --> 01:05:26.542
Or did I make you think I was?

853
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.625
See. I asked myself:

854
01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:33.000
Why should I try to pass
the Three Deadly Trials

855
01:05:33.167 --> 01:05:36.458
when my very eager nephew
would do it for me?

856
01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:38.667
Now give me that scepter.

857
01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:40.417
Don't do it. Don't give it to him!

858
01:05:41.292 --> 01:05:44.375
You're smart. Chickenhare.
I could use someone like you.

859
01:05:44.917 --> 01:05:48.542
You could be in charge
of my adventure society.

860
01:05:48.917 --> 01:05:50.958
We'll show everyone who laughs at us.

861
01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:54.792
take our revenge on those who'd shun us
because we're different.

862
01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:57.292
We're so alike. you and I.

863
01:05:58.125 --> 01:06:00.083
I'm nothing like you.

864
01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:03.167
But you are.
Because Chickenhare…

865
01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:04.625
I'm your father.

866
01:06:06.292 --> 01:06:08.167
I'm just kidding.
I'm not your father!

867
01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:10.625
But wouldn't it
have been crazy if I was.

868
01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:12.042
right?

869
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:14.333
Give me that scepter or…

870
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.250
One more step
and I'll throw it over the edge.

871
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:20.042
Do it and I'll throw your friends over.

872
01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.083
Give it to him! Post haste.

873
01:06:22.417 --> 01:06:23.875
Do not call his bluff.

874
01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:26.458
Prisoners play a lot of poker!
A lot!

875
01:06:26.625 --> 01:06:29.458
If I give it to you.
you'll let them go?

876
01:06:29.792 --> 01:06:31.875
I'll let you all go.

877
01:06:32.042 --> 01:06:33.083
I swear it.

878
01:06:33.417 --> 01:06:35.417
Chickenhare. no. he's lying.

879
01:06:35.917 --> 01:06:39.083
Do you know the final piece
of the legend. Chickenhare?

880
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.500
"He who releases the Hamster of Darkness

881
01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:46.083
"shall be followed for all of his days."

882
01:06:49.417 --> 01:06:51.625
That's right. little freak.

883
01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:02.708
I. Lapin the IX.

884
01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:04.625
call upon you

885
01:07:04.958 --> 01:07:07.375
to bring the darkness.

886
01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:26.833
What have I done?

887
01:07:33.667 --> 01:07:36.208
Now what do you say
we go take back my kingdom?

888
01:07:36.417 --> 01:07:40.667
- What about the freak and his friends?
- I promised I'd let them go.

889
01:07:40.833 --> 01:07:42.958
So. let them go… over the edge.

890
01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:44.958
Darn semantics…

891
01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:55.458
I have good news and bad news.

892
01:07:55.958 --> 01:07:58.167
The bad news is that
you should freeze to death

893
01:07:58.333 --> 01:08:00.750
in about 12 hours.

894
01:08:00.917 --> 01:08:03.125
Really? I think
it's gonna be much quicker.

895
01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:04.542
What's the good news?

896
01:08:04.708 --> 01:08:07.958
Please be that they're sending
a rope down for us.

897
01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:11.583
The good news is you'll live longer
than your father. Chickenhare.

898
01:08:12.292 --> 01:08:13.917
I wouldn't call that good news.

899
01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:16.125
Maybe slightly better news…

900
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.500
We found nothing.

901
01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:28.250
It was just another
of my brother's tricks.

902
01:08:28.417 --> 01:08:30.417
Hope for the best
and prepare for the worst.

903
01:08:30.583 --> 01:08:33.167
If Lapin got to the scepter.
things could get rough.

904
01:08:33.458 --> 01:08:36.167
Go and take shelter in the dungeon.

905
01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:42.292
<i>Dad. I've gone to stop Lapin.</i>

906
01:08:42.458 --> 01:08:45.667
<i>I know I'm not an Adventurer like you.</i>
<i>but I'll try my best.</i>

907
01:08:45.833 --> 01:08:47.417
<i>I'm sorry for all this.</i>

908
01:08:47.583 --> 01:08:50.125
<i>I love you. Chickenhare.</i>

909
01:08:56.333 --> 01:08:57.542
This is all my fault.

910
01:08:57.708 --> 01:09:01.875
You know what? You're right!
It is all your fault! 100%!

911
01:09:02.125 --> 01:09:04.292
We could've gone home now. but no.

912
01:09:04.458 --> 01:09:06.375
you needed to find
the Hamster of Darkness.

913
01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:09.167
- So everyone would forget you're…
- A freak?

914
01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:13.750
I thought bringing it back
would make them accept me.

915
01:09:15.333 --> 01:09:16.958
It's not all your fault.

916
01:09:17.125 --> 01:09:19.458
It's Meg's fault too.
She's a terrible influence.

917
01:09:19.833 --> 01:09:23.042
And I wasn't gonna say "freak."
I was gonna say "Chickenhare."

918
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.333
- Same thing.
- No. they're not.

919
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:28.875
Look at me!
Why couldn't I just be normal?

920
01:09:29.042 --> 01:09:32.417
Lapin never would've escaped.
and I wouldn't've come all this way.

921
01:09:32.833 --> 01:09:36.500
Because you're not normal!
Pretending you were only made it worse.

922
01:09:37.042 --> 01:09:39.917
But when you got rid of that costume
and became you…

923
01:09:40.292 --> 01:09:41.708
You found the Hamster of Darkness.

924
01:09:41.875 --> 01:09:45.250
The treasure that no adventurer
could find for thousands of years.

925
01:09:45.542 --> 01:09:47.875
Yeah. Lapin never would've found it
without you.

926
01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:50.083
I'm trying to let it go.
but I can't.

927
01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:53.000
Look. all of us are born with things
that make us different.

928
01:09:53.167 --> 01:09:55.792
The only choice we have
is how we see those things.

929
01:09:56.083 --> 01:09:59.958
So. we can either be ashamed of them
or we can embrace them

930
01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:01.875
and recognize that our differences
make us…

931
01:10:02.042 --> 01:10:03.250
Special.

932
01:10:05.958 --> 01:10:07.458
- No!
- Chickenhare!

933
01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:37.458
Really?

934
01:10:44.542 --> 01:10:46.000
Come on. Abe.

935
01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:48.625
They're too far ahead.

936
01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:51.125
By the time we get to your kingdom.
it'll be too late.

937
01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:54.458
We've come too far.
There's gotta be a way.

938
01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:56.833
- I have a plan.
- You have a plan?

939
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.042
I have my moments.

940
01:10:59.417 --> 01:11:00.917
My secret shame.

941
01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:03.000
I was born without a shell.

942
01:11:03.167 --> 01:11:06.542
This one's my Uncle Herb's…
Love you Uncle Herbie!

943
01:11:09.708 --> 01:11:12.875
What? It's not like I got feathers
growing out of my head.

944
01:11:13.042 --> 01:11:14.458
It's not that.

945
01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:16.583
It's just that…

946
01:11:16.875 --> 01:11:19.375
you're really pale.

947
01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:21.750
That is unattractive.

948
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:24.417
Anyway. who's ready to ride?

949
01:11:28.375 --> 01:11:30.750
- Should've used less wax!
- Get down!

950
01:11:32.875 --> 01:11:33.875
Watch out!

951
01:11:43.042 --> 01:11:44.250
Alright!

952
01:11:44.417 --> 01:11:46.667
- We're gonna catch Lapin.
- Or not.

953
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:53.125
I hate adventuring.

954
01:11:59.042 --> 01:12:00.792
Sir. Lapin's at the gate.

955
01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:03.042
He requests to see you.

956
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.417
Let's settle this!

957
01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:15.500
Not another step forward. Brother.
until you tell me where my son is.

958
01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.708
You mean that worthless
little half-breed freak?

959
01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:21.792
He's not coming back.

960
01:12:21.958 --> 01:12:24.125
I made quite sure of that.

961
01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:27.208
Hold it.

962
01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:30.500
Brother. please. Where is my son?

963
01:12:32.708 --> 01:12:34.750
I assume by now he's frozen to death

964
01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.500
on the side of the cliff
I threw him over.

965
01:12:36.667 --> 01:12:37.667
No!

966
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:39.250
The scepter?

967
01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:42.000
That's right! I found it.

968
01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:44.750
Ah. technically Chickenhare found…

969
01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:47.458
Enough talk. Hamsters. attack!

970
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.792
Sounds like a lost cause.

971
01:13:10.958 --> 01:13:12.625
My favorite kind.

972
01:13:12.792 --> 01:13:14.583
Meg. I'll need your whip.

973
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.042
Thought you'd never ask.

974
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.167
We can sneak up on Lapin.

975
01:13:29.333 --> 01:13:32.417
That's a terrible plan.
he's got a million hamsters.

976
01:13:32.583 --> 01:13:33.625
Lance. Whitey!

977
01:13:33.792 --> 01:13:35.625
Chickenhare!
We thought you were dead.

978
01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:38.625
Nope. Alive and kicking with these.

979
01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:40.750
So. where do we stand?

980
01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.542
It looks pretty hopeless.

981
01:13:43.708 --> 01:13:44.833
We gotta get down there.

982
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.167
We gotta figure out a way
to get past those million hamsters.

983
01:13:48.333 --> 01:13:49.625
With big tails.

984
01:13:50.167 --> 01:13:52.458
What? I was born without a shell.

985
01:13:52.792 --> 01:13:55.750
A dose of skepticism
has been essential to my survival.

986
01:13:56.708 --> 01:13:58.583
That's how we sneak up on Lapin!

987
01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:02.875
- With my skepticism?
- No. with your shell.

988
01:14:03.042 --> 01:14:06.667
Well. at least we know your plan's
not the worst one. Whitey.

989
01:14:07.667 --> 01:14:09.667
Mine. at long last.

990
01:14:12.458 --> 01:14:13.917
Perfect fit.

991
01:14:14.542 --> 01:14:17.542
Actually. I'll need
to have it taken in a little

992
01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:21.250
because you have
such a big fat head. Brother.

993
01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.625
Maybe you're not so perfect
after all.

994
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
What?

995
01:14:30.167 --> 01:14:33.042
Peg. say hello
to my little smelly friend!

996
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.750
Hey. Chickenhare's plan worked!

997
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.667
Chickenhare!

998
01:14:48.625 --> 01:14:49.625
You?

999
01:14:49.792 --> 01:14:54.500
Hamsters. I command you to fight no more
and return to the scepter.

1000
01:14:56.833 --> 01:14:58.250
I mean it.

1001
01:14:58.417 --> 01:14:59.417
I'm serious.

1002
01:14:59.792 --> 01:15:01.708
I command you!

1003
01:15:02.667 --> 01:15:03.958
Please…

1004
01:15:06.208 --> 01:15:07.417
Fool!

1005
01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:10.250
That scepter is nothing without me.

1006
01:15:10.625 --> 01:15:12.917
"For he who releases
the Hamster of Darkness

1007
01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:15.833
"shall be followed for all of his days."

1008
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.417
The power's already mine.

1009
01:15:17.583 --> 01:15:19.792
That's not true. Without the scepter.

1010
01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:21.750
he will lose his power.

1011
01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.292
Then I'll get rid of it.

1012
01:15:23.833 --> 01:15:24.833
Hamsters…

1013
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:26.708
Run. Chickenhare!

1014
01:15:26.875 --> 01:15:28.083
Attack!

1015
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:44.375
Now what?

1016
01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:47.667
What are you waiting for?
Break that wall!

1017
01:16:14.292 --> 01:16:17.042
Get the scepter. now.
before he throws it in the pit!

1018
01:16:30.208 --> 01:16:31.875
Hamsters. the wheel!

1019
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.875
Okay. Chickenhare.
that's how you want to play it.

1020
01:16:44.042 --> 01:16:46.833
then let's do it my way.

1021
01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:03.667
How does it look?

1022
01:17:07.792 --> 01:17:08.917
That wasn't there before.

1023
01:17:23.792 --> 01:17:26.750
Hey rodents.
come and get us if you dare!

1024
01:17:32.708 --> 01:17:33.917
Hi there.

1025
01:18:08.958 --> 01:18:09.958
Look at him!

1026
01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:13.542
Get me the scepter
if you want to fly another day.

1027
01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:27.333
Come on!

1028
01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.917
Game over. Lapin.

1029
01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:47.333
No it's not.
we're just about to get started.

1030
01:19:23.958 --> 01:19:25.792
Catch me if you can!

1031
01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:29.292
- Let's finish this. Brother.
- Not so fast.

1032
01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:33.917
Hamsters. charge!

1033
01:19:40.292 --> 01:19:43.000
Finish him. Chickenhare's mine.

1034
01:20:21.125 --> 01:20:22.625
Give me that!

1035
01:20:39.375 --> 01:20:40.375
Good riddance.

1036
01:21:02.542 --> 01:21:03.667
Uncle!

1037
01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:22.958
I got you. come on.

1038
01:21:29.792 --> 01:21:31.583
Chickenhare. no!

1039
01:21:32.042 --> 01:21:34.958
Fly chicken. fly.

1040
01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:57.542
If I'm going down.
at least I'm taking you with me.

1041
01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:03.708
What?

1042
01:22:03.875 --> 01:22:05.583
Impossible!

1043
01:22:34.708 --> 01:22:36.500
Hey. guys. I'm back!

1044
01:22:36.667 --> 01:22:38.333
Alright. you did it!

1045
01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:41.042
Did you see that? I can fly!

1046
01:22:41.708 --> 01:22:44.500
I wouldn't call that flying.
more like gliding.

1047
01:22:44.958 --> 01:22:46.750
Abe. cork it. will you?

1048
01:22:46.917 --> 01:22:48.125
Chickenhare.

1049
01:22:48.292 --> 01:22:49.542
you found it.

1050
01:22:50.292 --> 01:22:51.833
Yeah. but Lapin took it and…

1051
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.500
Not the Hamster of Darkness.
Chickenhare.

1052
01:22:54.667 --> 01:22:55.875
You.

1053
01:22:56.208 --> 01:22:57.458
You found you.

1054
01:22:59.833 --> 01:23:01.208
I'm glad.

1055
01:23:02.458 --> 01:23:04.042
Me too. Dad.

1056
01:23:06.042 --> 01:23:08.292
A hare who can fly.

1057
01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:10.000
How cool is this?

1058
01:23:10.167 --> 01:23:13.583
What are you talking about?
He can fly because he's a chicken.

1059
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:15.333
What? He's a hare.

1060
01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:16.500
- Chicken.
- Hare.

1061
01:23:16.667 --> 01:23:17.792
- Chicken.
- Hare.

1062
01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:21.542
So what'd I miss?

1063
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.292
Hey!

1064
01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:26.417
What do you want from me?
I just…

1065
01:23:33.458 --> 01:23:34.458
Chickenhare?

1066
01:23:39.833 --> 01:23:40.833
Chickenhare.

1067
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.167
I knew it.

1068
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:50.292
Chickenhare. what are you doing?

1069
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:54.125
Guys. I just discovered the location
of the holy spork!

1070
01:23:54.625 --> 01:23:56.417
We leave in 5 minutes.

1071
01:23:56.583 --> 01:24:00.083
But they're just about to start
bringing out the hors d'oeuvres.

1072
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.042
But what about your induction?

1073
01:24:02.208 --> 01:24:04.042
This is what you've wanted
your whole life.

1074
01:24:04.208 --> 01:24:05.667
Sorry. Dad. don't have time.

1075
01:24:05.833 --> 01:24:09.375
Hold on. Chickenhare.
You can't leave…

1076
01:24:09.875 --> 01:24:11.000
without this.

1077
01:24:16.833 --> 01:24:18.625
Your golden machete.

1078
01:24:19.042 --> 01:24:21.000
You really mean this?

1079
01:24:21.542 --> 01:24:23.375
I love you. Dad.

1080
01:24:25.542 --> 01:24:28.417
Now. go get that holy spork.

1081
01:24:44.333 --> 01:24:47.792
What are the odds
both of my best friends are masochists?

1082
01:24:51.792 --> 01:24:52.792
Hey!

1083
01:30:54.458 --> 01:30:57.000
