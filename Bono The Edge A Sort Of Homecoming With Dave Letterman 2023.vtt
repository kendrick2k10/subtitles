3
00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:19.602
Growing up in Ireland.

4
00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:23.106
it felt as if the future
was always somewhere else.

5
00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:29.070
In our Dublin.
it felt as if there were no present.

6
00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:31.990
let alone past or future.

7
00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:42.125
In our band.

8
00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:46.421
we felt estranged from any traditions
we could have held on to.

9
00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:53.762
And the question
that began to intrigue us was.

10
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.474
"How do we fit into this story?"

11
00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.568
I'm looking for the peanut butter cups.

12
00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:10.945
I don't think we got some here.

13
00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.078
{\an8}Eh. what are those?

14
00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.872
{\an8}Just-- Just--
I don't wanna touch your food.

15
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.167
{\an8}Well. see. now you've touched--
Okay. Thank you.

16
00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:25.960
{\an8} <i>...for boarding.
Thank you.</i>

17
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.838
{\an8}- You know. what's your name?
- Felix.

18
00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:30.173
Felix? I'm Dave.

19
00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.718
Nice to see you.
I'm trying to get to Dublin.

20
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:35.720
Take care. Thank you.

21
00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:52.237
{\an8}I'll tell you what else is. uh.
great about the show tonight.

22
00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.782
{\an8}This is the biggest. the greatest.

23
00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:59.119
{\an8}most exciting. most influential
rock-and-roll band in the world.

24
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.913
Ladies and gentlemen. once again. U2.

25
00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.213
U2. ladies and gentlemen.

26
00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.134
-  Hi. Dave.
- Oh. my goodness.

27
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.553
- A pleasure to see you again.
- Good to see you.

28
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.638
Thank you for letting me be part of this.

29
00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.683
Good God. What expectations
you have set for yourself.

30
00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:25.478
Writer. poetry and prose. musician.

31
00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.021
Something else I forgot.

32
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:30.942
My. um. self-esteem... never been lower.

33
00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.485
- I just wanna tell you...

34
00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:33.653
...the door is now closed.

35
00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.739
- You and I are not gonna be best friends.

36
00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:40.368
D-D-Do you like
retrospectives of yourself?

37
00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.829
Do you like looking over your shoulder
at this point in your life?

38
00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.913
No.

39
00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.332
Okay. Well. that's all we need.
Thank you very much.

40
00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.628
Let's-- Let's talk about music.

41
00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:54.757
Years of reflection has caused you
to change lyrics in some of these songs.

42
00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:58.011
Some of them you thought perhaps
were never finished in the first place.

43
00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.095
Yeah. that's right.

44
00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:04.309
We wanted to. sort of.
strip away the artifice

45
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.395
that inevitably emerges after
you've been around this long.

46
00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:14.903
In the isolation of the pandemic.
it was almost like the question became.

47
00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.739
"What is left when everything
is stripped away?"

48
00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.033
But where do you take it?

49
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.536
All right. yeah.
Let's take it from the top.

50
00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.956
Do you-- Do you wanna know
what I did during the pandemic?

51
00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:28.958
- What did you do?
- Calligraphy.

52
00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.126
- Really?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:31.669
- I've gotten very good.
- How cool.

54
00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:32.754
- Wow.
- Yeah.

Two. three. four.

62
00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:18.591
And there was certainly a part of me
that wanted to hear them again.

63
00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.218
{\an8}as if for the first time.

64
00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:26.474
And we ask ourselves the nervous question.

65
00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:28.559
"Is there any merit to these songs

66
00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:32.855
if you take away the firepower
of a rock band like U2?"

67
00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:34.357
- Hold on.

68
00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:37.360

It might work for you to tickle
your instrument as it were.

83
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:13.396

96
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.014
It sounds really beautiful.

97
00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.892
and we got "His Dave-ness" to Dublin.

98
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.478
Where-- Where is Dave?

99
00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.526
Holy geez! They're still alive.

100
00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.030
- Oh. David Letterman!
- David.

101
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.698
- Hello. men.
- Hello.

102
00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:06.824
Hi.

103
00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:08.868
- Hi. How are you?
- Hello. How are you?

104
00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:09.952
How about this?

105
00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:11.871
-  Oh. yeah. Wow.
-  Wow.

106
00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:15.083
-  It's your first time here?
- It's my first time in Dublin.

107
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.377
My first time out of the house.
as a matter of fact.

108
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.129
Tell us a little bit
about this establishment.

109
00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:21.672
InDub Reggae Store.

110
00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:23.966
- The only reggae shop in Ireland.
- The only reggae shop?

111
00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:25.510
Yeah. the only reggae shop in Ireland.

112
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.346
I'm interested in a wheel of cheese.

113
00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.515
I've never purchased a wheel of cheese.

114
00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.768
{\an8}I would like to buy two hats
for friends of mine.

115
00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.186
- All right.
- Their heads are...

116
00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:38.898
One's about like this.
and one's about like that.

117
00:06:39.982 --> 00:06:43.486
Is there anyone here that can help
an old man carrying a cheese?

118
00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.448
I'd like to welcome you
all today to the U2 walking tour.

119
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.076
There are certain bands.
when I listen to them.

120
00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.079
I just see streetscapes open up before me.

121
00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.706
And Dublin and U2 is deeply connected.

122
00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:02.797
{\an8}In October '77. a great British punk band
called The Clash played two gigs

123
00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.550
{\an8}in the Examinations Hall
of Trinity College. Dublin.

124
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.137
And in the crowd was a young.
impressionable Bono.

125
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.267
Seeing The Clash onstage
singing these angry songs

126
00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.436
was a moment of awakening.

127
00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:20.731
Later on. when they're arguably
the biggest band in the world.

128
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.901
they never really forget
this part of Dublin.

129
00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:26.737
and everything it does for them.

130
00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.617
I-I was told there would be a hot meal.

131
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.543
Let's. uh. go back.

132
00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:46.424
- Exactly what you don't wanna do.

133
00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:49.677
How old were you kids
when you got together and. uh...

134
00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:53.181
So in '76. I would've been. uh. 15.

135
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.265
Fifteen?

136
00:07:58.186 --> 00:07:59.187
That.

137
00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:03.441
At age 11.
I went to that school for one year.

138
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.026
They asked me to leave.

139
00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.487
Had they not have.
I would not have met this man.

140
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.738
- Really?
- This is true.

141
00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:13.201
Tell me about
your relationship with the band.

142
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:14.285
When did that begin?

143
00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.329
{\an8} February. '82.

144
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:19.624
{\an8}-  You became close with them?
- Close enough.

145
00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.919
Make sure you got some sun on your faces.

146
00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.880
Yeah. you're all about shadows.
aren't you?

147
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.965
But you are part of the family.

148
00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:32.261
H-Have you seen them. obviously. change
over the years since you've met them?

149
00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.182
Um. they're the same people. you know?
I-I have to say.

150
00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.767
-  Move in.
- Okay. the Edge.

151
00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:39.894

157
00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:58.329
I'd say the band
was born out of the culture

158
00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:02.500

at a particular time.

160

It's-- It's non-denominational.
people of any religion can come.

162
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.391
and. more importantly to me.
girls and boys.

166
00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:36.951
We invented a whole culture
of our own amongst our friends.

167
00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.121
We called ourselves Lypton Village.

168
00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.539
I can't remember why.

169
00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:46.877
And in Lypton Village. all our friends
were given their own unique nicknames.

170
00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:49.797
That's where I got the name "the Edge."

171
00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:51.132
Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:54.719
Bono's Village name
was "Bono Vox of O'Connell Street."

173
00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.929
- The-The hearing-aid store?
-  Right.

174
00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:59.432
And this was part of a pushback

175
00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:02.852
against the conservative society
that we were a part of.

176
00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.774
{\an8}-  So here we have the Edge.
-  Yeah.

177
00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:10.818
{\an8}-  Bono.
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:12.778
{\an8}-  Then we have Adam.
- Mm-hmm.

179
00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:14.196
{\an8} And we have Larry.

180
00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:16.657
When you hear what
their original Village names were.

181
00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:19.243
you would understand why
they didn't run with them.

182
00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:21.704
So. Larry's was--
He was known as "The Jam Jar."

183
00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:22.955
The Jam Jar?

184
00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:25.499
Adam was "Mrs. Burns."

185
00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:28.836
The bass player is called "Mrs. Burns."

186
00:10:28.836 --> 00:10:29.920
-  Yeah.
- Ah!

187
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.466
<i>♪ We got spirit. we got soul ♪</i>

188
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.802
<i>♪ My brothers and I are out of control ♪</i>

189
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.222
We had no aspirations beyond

190
00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:43.142
just something fun to do
on a Saturday afternoon.

191
00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:48.272
But then. weirdly.
as we started to play together.

192
00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:51.442
and at first atrociously badly.

193
00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.861
we recognized some chemistry there.

194
00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:01.243
My. uh. nickname. "Dumbass."

195
00:11:01.243 --> 00:11:03.329
{\an8}- Yeah.

196
00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:14.090
{\an8} You and I last saw
one another in the early aughts.

197
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.550
{\an8} The early aughts.
We were on doing your show.

198
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.261
{\an8}Our next guests are a pair
of talented singer-songwriters

199
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:20.846
who star in the motion picture <i>Once</i>...

200
00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:25.059
In those days. I don't think
you and I talked much of anything

201
00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:27.561
other than here he is.
and thank you and good night.

202
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:30.189
Yeah. you stuck your head into the room.
We said a quick hello.

203
00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:31.524
- It was a big deal.

204
00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.110
Other than that.
we were all told. "Avoid David."

205
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.696
- And don't look me in the eye.
- That's what we were told. yeah.

206
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:39.115
Hi. Glen. That was beautiful. Excuse me.

207
00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:41.492
Your eyes. by the way.
stunningly beautiful.

208
00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:42.743
Oh. thank you. David.

209
00:11:42.743 --> 00:11:44.328
Uh. explain where we are.

210
00:11:44.328 --> 00:11:46.080
We're in Dublin.
Well. we're in Greystones.

211
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.292
So we're on the kind of southern edge
of the "swerve of shore bend of bay."

212
00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:52.378
- To quote Joyce. We're in-- Yeah.
- Hmm.

213
00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:55.089
Oh. you've been here less than a minute.
and you're quoting Joyce.

214
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.507
- Good Lord.

215
00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:59.677
You know. I'm meeting you.
I have to impress you with the Irishness.

216
00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:03.222
We're gonna talk
about your buddies. U2.

217
00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:06.183
Yeah. Well.
I've known them pretty much all my life.

218
00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:10.312
When I was ten years old.
my uncle took me to see the Police.

219
00:12:11.188 --> 00:12:13.816
but the opening band was U2.

220
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.783
-  Oh. my God.
-  Yeah. Yeah.

221
00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:25.453
And everyone. the whole. like--

222
00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:29.331
This guy came onstage
and he was like-- he was possessed.

223
00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:39.383
- Everybody left going. "Who were they?"
- Mm-hmm.

224
00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:42.136
And they were Irish. They were Dubliners.

225
00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.388
They were from the same town I'm from.

226
00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.099
And so we all became obsessed.

227
00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:55.107
{\an8}It didn't sound like anything else.

228
00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:59.445
{\an8}Not just in Ireland. but anything else we
were hearing from America or from Britain.

229
00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.155
U2 were completely different.

230
00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:04.033
<i>♪ I was on the outside when you said ♪</i>

231
00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:06.702
<i>♪ You said you needed me ♪</i>

232
00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:09.663
So not just America. uh. but globally.

233
00:13:09.663 --> 00:13:14.251
why do people respond. uh.
emotionally to this music?

234
00:13:14.251 --> 00:13:18.297
Well. the first time you heard
"I Will Follow" on the radio.

235
00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.257
at that time
where everything was trying to show

236
00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:21.884
how much you were against everything.

237
00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:28.933
you know. U2 was trying to express
something with this force of sincerity.

238
00:13:30.434 --> 00:13:33.145
They had a purpose and they had
an earnestness in their music

239
00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.605
that you could easily dismiss.

240
00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:39.026
Because Bono was just-- He was like. uh.
he was strident with something pure.

241
00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:41.237
<i>♪ Why. oh. why? ♪</i>

242
00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:44.532
The first album was made--
I would've been 18.

243
00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:48.285
So we were kids. really.
when we started on it.

244
00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:51.664
Did you have a vision
for your future at all.

245
00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.958
or was it day-to-day. week-to-week?

246
00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.212
It was about our concerts
and about. you know. the U2 audience live

247
00:13:58.212 --> 00:14:02.633
that gave us a constant sense of
moving up and moving forward.

248
00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:08.514
It was a complete game changer.

249
00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:11.350
U2 kind of cleared the decks.

250
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.020
Like. any bands that were going.
U2 were suddenly. boom.

251
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.481
<i>♪ I was looking through the window
I was lost ♪</i>

252
00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:19.817
Nobody ever would've
thought that U2 would be the band.

253
00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:22.403
Because they were. kind of. just. like.
awkward and--

254
00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.405
But they had something.
They had a kind of a--

255
00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.490
They had a message in their songs.

256
00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:33.414
Thank you. God bless you.

257
00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.755
Wanna go see a U2 show tomorrow?

258
00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:44.091
There's a. uh. free U2 show.

259
00:14:44.091 --> 00:14:45.175
-  Oh.
- Yeah.

260
00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:47.219
Are you familiar with the band U2?

261
00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:49.388
- Yes. Yes.
- Have you ever seen them live?

262
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.724
Uh. not live. believe it or not.

263
00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.684
- They're doing a show in town here.
- Yeah. Yeah.

264
00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.060
- Tomorrow night.
-  Yeah.

265
00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.604
You should come to the show.

266
00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:59.773
Just mention my name and you'll get in.

267
00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:02.568
Just say. uh.
"Dave said it would be okay if I came."

268
00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.403
Yeah. okay. I'd love to.
That'd be a pleasure.

269
00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:07.114
Yeah. you should--
For God's sake. you should go. Yes.

270
00:15:07.114 --> 00:15:09.491
- My work here is finished.

271
00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:12.244
But I think what's interesting now is
that I think there's--

272
00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:14.496
they're going back to the beginning again.

273
00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:19.543
Your biggest competition
is wanting to be safe.

274
00:15:19.543 --> 00:15:22.796
{\an8}It feels really good
to sell 20 million albums.

275
00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.715
{\an8}or whatever the heck it is.

276
00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:27.217
{\an8}And you know what that sounds like.

277
00:15:27.217 --> 00:15:31.388
But to say. "No. we're gonna change it.

278
00:15:31.388 --> 00:15:33.641
And we're gonna bring
our audience with us."

279
00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:37.227
- How do you sing this warm-up. the Edge?

280
00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:39.605
Uh. let me guess.

281
00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:47.237
Your biggest foe there
is your fear of moving forward.

282
00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:52.159
See. the problem with these is
they don't tell you where to go.

283
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.620
Oh. we'll find our way.

284
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.121
- Don't you worry.

285
00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:06.298
{\an8}This is a bit of a day. isn't it?

286
00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:08.300
Lovely.

287
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.182
- Yeah. Seeing them for the first time.

288
00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:17.935
- What a venue.
- Yes.

289
00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.395
-  Fantastic.
- Yeah. yeah.

290
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:22.439
Is everything you do still
within your comfort zone?

291
00:16:22.439 --> 00:16:24.024
Rarely.

292
00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:26.485
Yeah. the-- I'm rarely in my comfort zone.

293
00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:28.737
And I think that's been difficult
for the band.

294
00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:30.614
because I don't let them be in it either.

295
00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:37.997
For me. music and songwriting is just.
you know. heart surgery.

296
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:48.632
Oh. no.

297
00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:50.592
Thank you very much.

298
00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:54.847
Thank you.

299
00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.725
Do we have an idea
of what we're in for tonight?

300
00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:03.272
You will be very. very happy
you did have this experience.

301
00:17:04.898 --> 00:17:06.066
Are you ready?

302
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:09.611
Bono and the Edge.

303
00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:24.585

360
00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:32.522
The genesis of the band is always linked
with religious. Christian influence.

361
00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:34.149
To me that sounds unusual.

362
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:37.402
When you compare it to the United States
with a rock-and-roll band.

363
00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:41.240
it's kids smoking weed in their garage
and wanting to meet girls.

364
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.200
- We'll get to that.

365
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.118
Is that because of Ireland?

366
00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.497
Well. I should draw you a map.

367
00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:50.791
Okay. so...

368
00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:54.044
Just give me a second
till I get a rough Ireland for you.

369
00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:55.629
Okay. that's close enough.

370
00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:58.840
So we live on a tiny island
in the North Sea.

371
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.261
brutalized by occasional bad weather
and some difficult neighbors.

372
00:21:03.178 --> 00:21:06.014
And in the country of Northern Ireland.

373
00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:10.852
the Northern Protestants
outnumbered the Catholics.

374
00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:13.105
What caused the border to be established?

375
00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:15.274
Our War of Independence.

376
00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.817
So who do I dislike in this?

377
00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:19.486
- I'm-- I'm eager to dislike somebody.

378
00:21:19.486 --> 00:21:20.862
I'm part of the great divide.

379
00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:22.906
I wanna dislike--
Shall I dislike the British?

380
00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:24.825
- No. No.
- Okay.

381
00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:27.035
- Whoever you don't like. I don't like.

382
00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:30.289
So chief among the differences here
still would be the religion?

383
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.373
Well. yeah.

384
00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:36.837
{\an8} When we were kids.
we were in the middle of the Troubles.

385
00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:41.174
<i>British troops. called to
break up a protest. killed 13 Catholics.</i>

386
00:21:42.217 --> 00:21:45.887
It was just a constant drip. drip. drip
when we were forming the band.

387
00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:51.059
So. we were looking for a way
to express our faith

388
00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:52.769
that wasn't obviously religious.

389
00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:57.899
And there was a kind of movement
in Ireland in the late '70s.

390
00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:00.861
uh. which was called Charismatic Renewal.

391
00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:04.448
And we met some religious people.

392
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:06.950
They'd no possessions. particularly.

393
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.785
They lived a very disciplined life.

394
00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:10.704
We thought they were
a bit punk-rock actually.

395
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.416
And they seemed to accept us
for who we are.

396
00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:19.171
But they'd. kind of. started to become
much more like a conventional church.

397
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:22.466
And it was then that the leadership.
sort of. came to us and said.

398
00:22:22.466 --> 00:22:26.803
"Look. you should be full-time for God.
not this rock-and-roll thing."

399
00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:29.681
Music was just something
that we had to give up

400
00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:33.769
because these people felt
rock and roll was kind of nonsense.

401
00:22:34.478 --> 00:22:37.939
And that the real job
was fixing a broken world.

402
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.443
And Edge was in some kind of--

403
00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:43.945
Yeah. agony.

404
00:22:44.571 --> 00:22:48.325
So it was taken that seriously that
it might actually put an end to the band.

405
00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:49.409
Yeah.

406
00:22:49.409 --> 00:22:54.915
Because if we are to be useful.
as it were. in music. well. what is--

407
00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:56.416
How's that gonna look?

408
00:22:57.042 --> 00:23:03.507
So I spent this couple of weeks really
trying to figure out what felt right.

409
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.802
It was still nagging at us.

410
00:23:06.802 --> 00:23:11.640
and the actual answer came in the shape

411
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.351
of a song that Edge started.

412
00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:23.693
And then on one particular day.
this rage poured out.

413
00:23:23.693 --> 00:23:28.031
This frustration
at not being able to write.

414
00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:30.534
not knowing
if I should be in a rock-and-roll band.

415
00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:34.204
Um. what the future might hold.

416
00:23:34.204 --> 00:23:35.956
How old were you at this point?

417
00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:37.124
Maybe 21.

418
00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:40.669
<i>♪ Can't believe the news today ♪</i>

00:23:49.886 --> 00:23:52.222
And I was watching it.
I'm standing beside it.

422
00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:58.979
I saw this transformation of internal rage
to external.

423
00:24:00.313 --> 00:24:05.068

00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:26.298
-  Yeah.
-"That's why I'm with this dude."

429
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.301
- And that song. "Sunday Bloody Sunday."
-  Yeah.

430
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:35.390
it was a way to feel our music could mean
something outside of just itself.

431
00:24:43.773 --> 00:24:48.028
We got this broadcast on RTÉ
of U2 at Red Rocks.

432
00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:49.237

in the north of Ireland. in America.

438
00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:15.972
U2 had gone and made our case
in front of millions of Americans.

439
00:25:15.972 --> 00:25:19.059
And we were getting to see it on TV.
and we were gobsmacked.

455
00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:14.948
So right now. we've got peace in Ireland.

456
00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:17.534
Eventually. I don't know when it will be.

457
00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:20.787
I hope it's in my lifetime.
when the border goes away.

458
00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:25.709
because it's kind of ridiculous
having a border on an island this size.

459
00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:30.338
And the north and the south will hopefully
have more respect for each other.

460
00:26:31.047 --> 00:26:32.132
That would be nice.

461
00:26:35.677 --> 00:26:39.681
Before it was a cinema. this was
part of Rotunda Hospital. this very room.

462
00:26:40.557 --> 00:26:42.434
I was born here. Yes. I was.

463
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.394
Brendan Behan said.

464
00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:47.606
"If you weren't born in the Rotunda.
you weren't a proper Dubliner."

465
00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:49.316
- There you go.

466
00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:55.447
This next song is the first song.
really. we wrote about Dublin.

467
00:26:55.447 --> 00:27:01.953
In the '70s. it was a very different
Dublin than it is today.

468
00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:03.830
A very different country.

469
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.165
Uh. very bad.

470
00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:06.916

00:30:15.188 --> 00:30:18.608
You see. I wasn't wrong about this.
was I. folks? It's a wonderful night.

509
00:30:19.609 --> 00:30:22.987
By the way. do you know who's doing a show
tonight at Croke Park stadium?

510
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.949
- Adam and Larry.
- Oh!

511
00:30:25.949 --> 00:30:28.743
- Yeah. I hear-- I hear it's great.

512
00:30:28.743 --> 00:30:30.245
- That's good.
- I'm sure it is.

513
00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.957
Let me ask you. uh.
a question about songwriting.

514
00:30:33.957 --> 00:30:36.084
When you're writing a song.
and you end up with...

515
00:30:36.084 --> 00:30:38.753
<i>♪ Hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo ♪</i>

516
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:42.257
- Who-- Who provided that inspiration?

517
00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:45.718
Bec-- I'm telling you. it's lovely.
but who says. "Okay. here's where you do"...

518
00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:47.720
<i>♪ Hoo-hoo ♪</i>

519
00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:51.516
We like to ask the big questions.
so we start with "who?"

520
00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:52.600
Uh-huh.

521
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.977
And we eventually get to "why."

522
00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:57.063
- So. we'll hear "why-why" later?
-  Yeah.

523
00:30:57.063 --> 00:30:59.899
- And "when" is coming.

524
00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:02.527
- That's a full night. isn't it. folks?

525
00:31:05.238 --> 00:31:10.326
Going back to the "why" of U2.
you gotta stay with the "why."

526
00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:14.122
And I think the band
are on the same page in this one.

527
00:31:15.331 --> 00:31:19.335
Yeah. they wanted to entertain.
but they didn't want to just entertain.

528
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:21.546
They wanted to do something great.

529
00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:26.551
Something that spiritually
affected people.

530
00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:29.429
And that's the "why."

531
00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:48.990
We grew up as a band on a live stage.

532
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.784
That's-- That's how we learned
to do what we do.

533
00:31:51.784 --> 00:31:55.872
And "Where the Streets Have No Name."
when I wrote the music.

534
00:31:55.872 --> 00:32:01.377
I set myself the specific.
sort of. thought exercise of.

535
00:32:01.377 --> 00:32:04.714
-"What would I want to listen to"...
- Mm-hmm.

536
00:32:04.714 --> 00:32:06.549
..."if I was in the audience?"

537
00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:08.968
What would blow me away?

538
00:32:08.968 --> 00:32:10.136
Uh. please do it again

539
00:32:10.136 --> 00:32:13.681
because this is an experience
I'll never get again in my life. so--

540
00:32:34.327 --> 00:32:38.873
"Where the Streets Have No Name"
is an unusual brew of a song.

541
00:32:38.873 --> 00:32:42.919
The lyric is not very fleshed out.

542
00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:47.173
But the suggestion
contained in the lyric is gigantic.

543
00:32:48.424 --> 00:32:51.594
And what it seems to suggest is.

544
00:32:51.594 --> 00:32:55.848
there's a transcendent place
we can go to together.

545
00:32:55.848 --> 00:32:56.933

E-Explain to me the connection between
"Where the Streets Have No Name"

561
00:34:10.173 --> 00:34:15.053
to Super Bowl XXXVI. six months
after the September 11th attack.

562
00:34:15.053 --> 00:34:21.976
I recall grappling with
the concept of America.

563
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.396
and what it meant to me
and what it might mean around the world.

564
00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:27.940
Um. and that this is a fragile moment.

565
00:34:33.112 --> 00:34:36.365
{\an8}-  I wanted to use some exhortation...
-  Mm-hmm.

566
00:34:36.365 --> 00:34:38.451
{\an8}...taking away normal spectacle.

567
00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:42.413
{\an8}and turning it into a monument
of rolling names.

568
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.125
{\an8}The Super Bowl halftimes are a spectacle.

569
00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:51.380
{\an8}But the greatest spectacles are emotions.

572
00:35:08.189 --> 00:35:12.276
the connection
about spirituality and religion.

573
00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:16.697
You-- You feel that. and it doesn't--
doesn't hit you over the head.

574
00:35:16.697 --> 00:35:19.200

That's my drug of choice.

578
00:35:30.837 --> 00:35:35.174
Uh. the feeling of. not writing a song.
but being sung by the song.

579
00:35:35.174 --> 00:35:37.343
Sounds a little arty. but it's not--

580
00:35:37.343 --> 00:35:40.847
It's-- You do-- You feel it. um.
strongly coming through you.

581
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.934
You know. and Brian Eno. who said to us.

582
00:35:46.018 --> 00:35:51.190
"You know. you should not be concerned
with things like being cool.

583
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.942
That would be uncool for you.

584
00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:55.194
- Just be yourselves."
- Right.

585
00:35:55.194 --> 00:35:58.906
You know. and I-I look back now
and I realize that's U2's thing.

586
00:35:58.906 --> 00:36:00.408
ecstatic music.

587
00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:09.208
Because you're in that studio.

00:38:15.876 --> 00:38:18.462
And they kinda got the rock-star thing.

624
00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:21.299
and the humor entered
what they were doing.

625
00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:22.883
Because they were the pilgrims.

626
00:38:22.883 --> 00:38:26.345
They were the guys going to America
with a Christian's mind-set.

627
00:38:26.345 --> 00:38:28.681
and suddenly they were the rock stars.

628

648
00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:03.442
And what I knew of Ireland growing up.
was it was controlled religiously.

649
00:40:03.442 --> 00:40:06.987
And then it changed.
and it changed quickly.

650
00:40:06.987 --> 00:40:08.781
How did it happen here?

651
00:40:08.781 --> 00:40:11.033
The world into which U2 are coming.

652
00:40:11.033 --> 00:40:14.829
is a society
which has been kind of liberalizing.

653
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:16.872
but is now going back. [laughs] You know?

654
00:40:16.872 --> 00:40:20.334
It's-- It's getting cold feet about.
"Do we really wanna change?

655
00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:22.461
Do we really wanna become more modern?"

656
00:40:27.383 --> 00:40:29.927
And this band comes
into the middle of that.

657
00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:32.888
And I think they formed a. kind of.
critical bridge...

658
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:40.771
{\an8}...from being a conservative society
to being the place it is now.

659
00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:42.940
{\an8}which is a very open and tolerant society.

660
00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.822
Oh. my God. Are those real diamonds?

661
00:40:49.822 --> 00:40:51.449
- Holy God.

662
00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:53.242
-  Dave. Dave.
-  Oh!

663
00:40:53.242 --> 00:40:55.453
You can't leave the building with those.

664
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:58.164
{\an8}Dressing like a woman makes
a lot of money in this culture.

00:40:59.582 --> 00:41:01.834
- This is your first time to Ireland?
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

666
00:41:01.834 --> 00:41:03.669
You need to get out more. Dave.

667
00:41:03.669 --> 00:41:06.130
That's true in almost
every aspect of my life.

668
00:41:07.173 --> 00:41:09.008
Like many things in my life.

669
00:41:09.008 --> 00:41:11.927
I'm operating on a--
from a position of ignorance.

670
00:41:11.927 --> 00:41:13.262
I'm an open book. Dave.

671
00:41:13.262 --> 00:41:15.222
- You can ask whatever you want.
- Okay. All right.

672
00:41:15.222 --> 00:41:17.475
- I'm unshockable.
- Yeah. that's good.

673
00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:23.647
Is it safe to say that Ireland was among
the most repressive toward homosexuality.

674
00:41:23.647 --> 00:41:26.484
and has now become
almost the diametric opposite?

675
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:27.568
Yes.

676
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.908
I grew up in a country that would
absolutely repress any hint of sexuality.

677
00:41:34.575 --> 00:41:40.372
Dublin. all through the '80s.
was this gray. aggressively normal.

678
00:41:40.372 --> 00:41:42.416
if you know what I mean. kind of place.

679
00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:45.711
Homosexuality wasn't even heard of.

680
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:48.797
You know. when I was
a high school student in the '80s.

681
00:41:48.797 --> 00:41:51.509
U2's albums were-- They exposed you.

682
00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.385
Did you respond to those as a kid?

683
00:41:53.385 --> 00:41:54.595
See. I didn't.

684
00:41:55.346 --> 00:42:00.100
I unfairly maligned U2.
because to me. at that time.

685
00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:06.398
they were part and parcel of this culture.
this sort of straight-boy rock culture

686
00:42:06.398 --> 00:42:09.360
that I felt absolutely rejected by.

687
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.486
So I left.

688
00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:14.740
I went to Japan. um.
to-- to live and work and do this.

689
00:42:16.075 --> 00:42:19.912
And while I was living there.
U2 came and performed.

690
00:42:19.912 --> 00:42:22.540
And I started to see.

691
00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:27.044
oh. actually this U2 is not the U2
that I. you know. unfairly maligned.

692
00:42:28.003 --> 00:42:32.132
What I saw onstage in Tokyo
was outward-looking. you know?

693
00:42:32.132 --> 00:42:34.093
It was sexy and fun.

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:42.601

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:06.542
Ireland was the first country
in the world ever

704
00:43:06.542 --> 00:43:08.919
to bring in same-sex marriage
through popular vote.

705
00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.045
One thing here.

706
00:43:10.045 --> 00:43:12.506
So Bono gives you the microphone.
do you remember what you said?

707
00:43:13.299 --> 00:43:15.593
I don't actually.

708
00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:17.678
Have you something to say to your people?

709
00:43:17.678 --> 00:43:19.471
I'd just like to say I think this might be

710
00:43:19.471 --> 00:43:21.390
the straightest audience
I've ever played to.

711
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.226
I would have to check that. Dave.

712
00:43:24.226 --> 00:43:26.478
That sounds like work
and I don't like to do work.

713
00:43:26.478 --> 00:43:30.608
So I would just like to say. on behalf
of people like me. thanks a million.

714
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:33.068
- We really appreciate it.

715
00:43:33.068 --> 00:43:34.320
Let's get married.

716
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.655
Yeah. I found my way back over the years.

717
00:43:37.197 --> 00:43:39.158
but not because I changed.

718
00:43:39.158 --> 00:43:41.910
I'm still the same idiot I was then.

719
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:45.664
But this country changed dramatically.

720
00:43:46.832 --> 00:43:50.377
U2 was a part of what allowed Ireland
to stand on its own two feet.

721
00:43:50.377 --> 00:43:52.087
So actually. we have our own thing.

722
00:43:52.087 --> 00:43:54.798
I appreciated that at the time
and I still do now.

723
00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:57.426
Well. good for you.
And do you have any questions for me?

724
00:43:57.426 --> 00:44:01.096
Um. yeah. I think you've always been.
kind of. low-key. a fashion icon. Dave?

725
00:44:01.096 --> 00:44:03.766
- You look like a cool dude now.

726
00:44:03.766 --> 00:44:05.809
- Cool dude of-- What age are you now?

727
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:07.645
- Seventy-five.
- Seventy-five.

728
00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:09.647
You are a cool-looking 75.

729
00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:11.982

- What do I do about the chest pains?

730
00:44:11.982 --> 00:44:13.484
- Oh! Oh!

731
00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:16.862
Dave. if you get chest pains and die here.
I'll be cashing in for years.

732
00:44:17.946 --> 00:44:20.366
I'll have a blue plaque out there.

734
00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:22.660
- Yeah.

735
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.412
There's several theaters in the world
where I died.

736
00:44:25.412 --> 00:44:27.998
-  Yeah.
- But this would be an honor to die here.

737
00:44:27.998 --> 00:44:29.708
Thank you for that.

738
00:44:29.708 --> 00:44:31.001

739
00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:43.263
Your work in particular

00:44:43.263 --> 00:44:46.850

Ireland is about a hundred years old.
and the band is about 50 years old.

810
00:49:30.008 --> 00:49:31.635
Which is more unlikely:

811
00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:36.473
That Ireland is a hundred and better than
ever. and the band. uh. 50 years in?

812
00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:38.058
To that question. I would say.

813
00:49:38.058 --> 00:49:43.522
it's probably the fact that we're a band
for this long is a more remarkable thing.

814
00:49:43.522 --> 00:49:45.941
We kind of grew up working together

815
00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:52.698
and learned how to be. you know.
people of the world because of our band.

816
00:49:52.698 --> 00:49:54.282
So we're probably. to some extent.

817
00:49:54.282 --> 00:49:58.328
oh. a little institutionalized
by being in U2 this long.

818
00:50:02.624 --> 00:50:06.044
I don't know that I could work
with my friends in a creative arena

819
00:50:06.044 --> 00:50:07.546
for any length of time.

820
00:50:08.296 --> 00:50:10.132
There's many times in the past. I think.

821
00:50:10.132 --> 00:50:14.594
that that might've been just
pushing our luck a little too far.

822
00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:20.100
Friendship.
it's deeply part of who we are.

823
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:23.854
But you could lose that along the way.
and we have to work on it.

824
00:50:25.439 --> 00:50:27.274
Do you embarrass the band?

825
00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:29.192
Yes. I do.

826
00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:36.408
My activism. as the band would accept.

827
00:50:36.408 --> 00:50:38.827
is fairly unhip work.

828
00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:41.663
If you're in a rock-and-roll band.

829
00:50:41.663 --> 00:50:44.291
you don't wanna be in a photograph
with some people

830
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:49.880
that might be polar opposite
to the values that you hold dear.

831
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.381
And I did that to them.

832
00:50:52.007 --> 00:50:55.886
{\an8}And-- And I'll say it's extraordinary
on a few levels because.

833
00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:59.347
{\an8}you know.
it's bad for both of our images.

834
00:50:59.347 --> 00:51:03.977
{\an8} When I was working with Jesse Helms
and we did great work together...

835
00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:12.819
Edge just said. "Please. just please.
whatever you do. don't bring Jesse Helms.

836
00:51:12.819 --> 00:51:16.740
who personally dismantled
the National Endowment for the Arts.

837
00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:19.576
do not bring him to a U2 show."

838
00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:22.496
- And I brought him to a U2 show.
-  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

839
00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:27.000
-  It was very hard for us.
-  Yeah.

840
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.836
There was a lot of tension
created by that.

841
00:51:31.546 --> 00:51:34.549
I wouldn't have done it. I guess.
I probably wouldn't have done it.

842
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:35.634
Mm-hmm.

843
00:51:36.176 --> 00:51:40.055
Yeah. it-- it's an awkward one.
It's an awkward one.

844
00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:45.644
You know.
I'm turning what we create as a band

845
00:51:45.644 --> 00:51:50.065
into currency that I choose to spend
in these areas.

846
00:51:52.567 --> 00:51:56.113
And they. by and large. support me.

847
00:51:56.113 --> 00:51:59.449
But I do know I test their patience.

848
00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:04.913
And do you feel that this relationship is
getting stronger as you guys get older?

849
00:52:05.539 --> 00:52:10.210
Yeah. I-- I think we acknowledge
each other's. um. idiosyncrasies.

850
00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:12.712
and they're not-- it's not threatening.

851
00:52:12.712 --> 00:52:15.257
- And we're also not in competition.
- Mm-hmm.

852
00:52:15.257 --> 00:52:20.011
It's-- It's just part of the way.
I suppose. we show respect to each other.

853
00:52:20.011 --> 00:52:21.179
Yeah. yeah.

854
00:52:23.431 --> 00:52:26.434
We have an unusual relationship.

855
00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:33.400
As I often explain to the audience.
Edge is from the future.

856
00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:37.237
And as I often ask him. "How is it?"

857
00:52:37.237 --> 00:52:39.948
Which he will always reply. "Better."

858
00:52:42.534 --> 00:52:44.619
-<i>Hi. guys.</i>
-  This is digital.

859
00:52:44.619 --> 00:52:46.705
It's not actually me. It's not video.

860
00:52:46.705 --> 00:52:48.415
- Now I'm confused. That's not you.
- No.

861
00:52:48.415 --> 00:52:50.167
- That's not a human being?
- No.

862
00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:52.752
It's a rendering of me as an avatar.

863
00:52:52.752 --> 00:52:55.881
<i>...virtual version of me.
A replica. Imagine if we could take...</i>

864
00:52:55.881 --> 00:52:57.132
- I just--

865
00:52:57.132 --> 00:53:00.510
Just promise me
you'll always use this for good. not evil.

866
00:53:08.185 --> 00:53:09.978
The thing I don't like--

867
00:53:10.812 --> 00:53:14.149
- The thing I don't like about you...

868
00:53:14.149 --> 00:53:18.820
The thing I don't like about Edge
is that he-- he-- he doesn't need me.

869
00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.990
I mean. he could be doing all of this.

870
00:53:22.741 --> 00:53:26.411
writing. singing. performing.
playing. producing. on his own.

871
00:53:27.913 --> 00:53:29.581
- But he doesn't.
- Mm-hmm.

872
00:53:30.165 --> 00:53:32.042
- Ha ha.
- 'Cause it's not as much fun.

{\an8} Wow. This-- You feel like
you're in Ireland here. eh?

907
00:56:07.238 --> 00:56:09.449
What is this called?
This is the Forty Foot?

908
00:56:09.449 --> 00:56:11.034
-  Yeah.
-  The Forty Foot.

909
00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:13.995
Tell us what--
Why are you here? And-- And then. why?

910
00:56:13.995 --> 00:56:15.538
I'm here to swim.

911
00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.499
{\an8}-  But did you lose a bet?
- No.

912
00:56:17.499 --> 00:56:19.709
{\an8}Well. explain the routine.

913
00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:22.253
Every morning. there's a crowd
of swimmers and we all meet up.

914
00:56:22.253 --> 00:56:24.005
-  Every season?
-  Every season.

915
00:56:24.005 --> 00:56:26.132
-  Summer. spring. winter. fall?
-  Yeah.

916
00:56:26.132 --> 00:56:28.843
- Hello. how is everyone?

917
00:56:28.843 --> 00:56:29.928
Just grand.

918
00:56:29.928 --> 00:56:34.307
-  There's a man in a Santa hat.
-  He swims here every day.

919
00:56:34.307 --> 00:56:37.018
- We're gonna say that that's me.
- Okay.

920
00:56:37.018 --> 00:56:39.354
- There I am. There's Dave.

921
00:56:39.354 --> 00:56:41.898
So you want me to swim
with Dave and pretend that's you?

922
00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:44.609
Yes. please do.
Yes. 'cause I'm freezing now.

923
00:56:46.986 --> 00:56:49.280
No. no.
I can make that sound without getting in.

924
00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.032
Ooh. is that kelp?

925
00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:53.993
Oh. my God!

926
00:56:57.497 --> 00:57:02.836
This is like there's been some shipwreck.
but yet. we've found the survivors.

927
00:57:04.212 --> 00:57:06.881
- How was that?
-  It was actually very nice.

928
00:57:06.881 --> 00:57:09.134
- You enjoyed it?
- Feels brilliant. Actually brilliant.

929
00:57:09.134 --> 00:57:11.094
- You're happy to be alive?
- Yeah. It's amazing.

930
00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:13.513
You go into the sea one person
and you come out another.

931
00:57:13.513 --> 00:57:16.182
-  That's lovely to hear.
- It's a great change. Try it.

932
00:57:16.182 --> 00:57:19.436
Yeah. wait till I get back to the hotel
and try it in the pool.

933
00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:20.603
Yes.

934
00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:23.273
Traditionally. this was only for men.

935
00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.525
{\an8}-  Until 1974...
-  Yeah. yeah.

936
00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:26.734
...and then women were allowed.

937
00:57:26.734 --> 00:57:29.446
I was here
when the women rushed in.

938
00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:32.073
and hopped in there
and swam in there naked.

939
00:57:32.866 --> 00:57:34.993
There's a lovely atmosphere down here.

940
00:57:34.993 --> 00:57:37.579
You never come out of a swim
without a smile on your face.

941
00:57:37.579 --> 00:57:40.081
- And if you've any worries--

942
00:57:40.081 --> 00:57:43.751
- If you've any worries. they're just gone.
- I understand the smile on your face.

943
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:46.671
- Sort of frozen on one's face.
-  Probably. yeah.

944
00:57:46.671 --> 00:57:48.715
Well. let's just see
what temperature this water is.

945
00:57:50.008 --> 00:57:52.969
{\an8}-  I wouldn't get too close to that.
- No. this is as close as I'm gonna get.

946
00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:57.307
- I told you not to let me get too close.

947
00:57:58.391 --> 00:58:00.643
I have to leave now. Shoes are wet.

948
00:58:05.273 --> 00:58:08.359
Well. we just want to welcome
the Forty Foot man.

949
00:58:08.359 --> 00:58:10.195
- He's been out in the Forty Foot...
- Yes.

950
00:58:11.279 --> 00:58:15.658
- ...and getting splashed around in the bay.
- Thank you. I. um...

951
00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:18.995
It was on the news. I stripped naked
and got in for 45 minutes.

952
00:58:21.206 --> 00:58:24.292
You've seen more of Dublin in the last
three days. he has. than...

953
00:58:24.292 --> 00:58:26.544
- You know. I was--
- ...than we have in the last year.

954
00:58:26.544 --> 00:58:28.630
This also was a gift.

955
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:31.925
Uh. we went somewhere and got on the DART.

956
00:58:31.925 --> 00:58:34.552
and. uh. spent two hours with Glen.

957
00:58:34.552 --> 00:58:36.054
Aha. well. there you go.

958
00:58:36.054 --> 00:58:39.766
That means you've-- Beard-off. beard-off.
Glen Hansard and you.

959
00:58:39.766 --> 00:58:41.768
He has a beautiful beard. but I--

960
00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:44.521
If you ever get a chance
to get right up close to him.

961
00:58:45.146 --> 00:58:48.024
you'll be hypnotized by his blue eyes.

962
00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:50.318
Oh. my goodness. ladies and gentlemen.

963
00:58:59.118 --> 00:59:01.621
There's a Moya Cannon poem

964
00:59:01.621 --> 00:59:05.833
that probably speaks a lot
to the idea of taking songs

965
00:59:05.833 --> 00:59:09.337
and what happens to songs
and where they go and where music goes.

966
00:59:09.963 --> 00:59:11.464
It's called "Carrying the Songs."

967
00:59:12.215 --> 00:59:14.342
{\an8}It was always those
with little else to carry

968
00:59:14.342 --> 00:59:16.177
{\an8}who carried the songs.

969
00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:20.515
- Deep rhythms-- Ah. [bleep].

970
00:59:20.515 --> 00:59:23.977
Every one of the poems I write.
ends in "Aw. [bleep]."

971
00:59:25.478 --> 00:59:27.480
- Okay. I think I have it.
- All right.

972
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.565
Okay. one more time.

973
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.920
So this idea that--
that songs are what we carry...

974
01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.006
- Yeah.
- ...even when we have nothing else.

975
01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:38.843
Those who are the victors
write the history.

976
01:00:38.843 --> 01:00:39.927
Yeah.

977
01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.513
And those who suffered wrote the songs.

978
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.642
So we have a lot of songs in Ireland.

979
01:01:05.286 --> 01:01:10.208
{\an8}<i>♪ Sometimes I wake up in the morning ♪</i>

980
01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:18.424
<i>♪ A ginger lady by my bed ♪</i>

981
01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:23.638
-  How long have you been sober?
-  Since I was 34.

982
01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:25.556
"Since I was 34." Okay. fingers crossed.

983
01:01:26.724 --> 01:01:28.017
- Wanna see a walk. Dave?
- Yeah.

984
01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:29.185
Watch this.

985
01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.437
Okay. this is a walk-- Dublin walk.
You ready?

986
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.983
Yeah. All right.

987
01:01:35.983 --> 01:01:37.527
- Pretty good.
-  Dublin.

988
01:01:39.153 --> 01:01:40.488
- Like that?
- Yeah. That's it.

989
01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.745
-  Are we here?
-  This is it.

990
01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:50.164
Haven't been in here for a long time.

991
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:52.291
Hello.

992
01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.632
Hello. hello. hello.

-  Aye.

-  Heya.
- Good to see ya.

Okay.

1001
01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:38.171
That was just wonderful. Thank you.

1002
01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:40.798

Wow. guys. That was badass.

1017
01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:18.062
{\an8}You've mentioned
recording phrases of music...

1018
01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:19.814
-  Yeah.
- ...on a device.

1019
01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:22.191
I mean. it could be
literally the middle of the night.

1020
01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:24.193
- I'll wake up with an idea.
- Mm-hmm.

1021
01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:27.905
So I have to get out of bed.
find the phone. a guitar.

1022
01:04:27.905 --> 01:04:32.702
Looking at my phone this morning.
I have 6.000 voice notes.

1023
01:04:37.748 --> 01:04:43.087
See. to be able to do this. honestly.
it's like you guys are a magic act.

1024
01:04:43.087 --> 01:04:45.214
Well. we have some magic for you.

1025
01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.800
We were gonna write a tune for you
called "Forty Foot Man."

1026
01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.343
When did this happen? How long--

1027
01:04:49.343 --> 01:04:52.513
- This is just downstairs.
- This is. uh. 3:00 a.m. this morning.

1028
01:04:52.513 --> 01:04:53.931
-  It started at 3:00 a.m.
- Really?

1029
01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:57.643
So this whole little thing that you're
doing for me now is fresh out of the oven?

1030
01:04:57.643 --> 01:04:58.728
Yeah.

1031
01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:01.063
- That's crazy.
-  Try it again. Let me try it again.

1032
01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:04.692
- Do you wanna give it a go?
- Yeah. Okay.

1033
01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:10.531
- Tell me when to start.
- You've written lyrics and everything.

1034
01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:11.949
Oh. yeah.

1035
01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:15.369
A one. two. three. four.

1036
01:05:15.953 --> 01:05:20.791
<i>♪ We come to love this Forty Foot man ♪</i>

1037
01:05:21.792 --> 01:05:26.297
<i>♪ He keeps on doing the best that he can ♪</i>

1038
01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:32.011

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:03.334

<i>♪ He travels... ♪</i>

1051
01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.940
-  Oh. man.
- You hate this--

1052
01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.024
- Okay.
- Oh. man.

1053
01:06:27.024 --> 01:06:31.153
The phrase in there that absolutely rings
true is. "Tries the best that he can."

1054
01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:36.283
And I have to tell myself that
every minute of every day.

1055
01:06:36.283 --> 01:06:39.078
Many nice things have happened for me
in my life.

1056
01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:41.789
This is-- would be
right at the top of that list.

1057
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:47.503
I mean. this is like people could call
and order custom-made U2 songs.

1058
01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:49.255
Well. I don't know about that.

1059
01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:52.133
You see.
the thing is it's about inspiration.

1060
01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:55.803
-  Oh. this is too much.
- You gave us the inspiration.

1061
01:06:55.803 --> 01:06:59.181
Well. when do we talk about.
uh. publishing?

1062
01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:01.767
- Publishing? [scoffs] Hey. back off.
-  Yeah.

1063
01:07:01.767 --> 01:07:03.686
- Back off. Letterman.

1064
01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:14.864
{\an8} "The greatest songwriting
is never conclusive...

1065
01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:19.618
but the search for conclusion."

1066
01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.038
Hmm.

1067
01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:31.756
<i>♪ How long

1068
01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:35.009

01:08:21.347 --> 01:08:24.850
<i>♪ Wipe the tears from your eyes ♪</i>

1077
01:08:26.018 --> 01:08:30.189
The lyrics of this
have been rewritten for the new release.

1078
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.732
Yeah. that's right.

1079
01:08:31.732 --> 01:08:35.611
What a thrill to finish "Sunday
Bloody Sunday" all these years later.

1080
01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:39.782
To go back to Derry
and make it present tense.

1081
01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:43.410
I could never have written that song
this way back then.

1082
01:08:47.164 --> 01:08:49.667
<i>♪ Here at the murder scene ♪</i>

1083

<i>♪ Where is the victory Jesus won? ♪</i>

1089
01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:31.709
Thank you.

1090
01:09:32.918 --> 01:09:36.964
So. all I want now is the answer to
the question. "How do you write a song?"

1091
01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:38.215
And I don't have that yet.

1092
01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:40.509
Not to get into the weeds too much.

1093
01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:43.387
but chords are the foundation
of all melody.

1094
01:09:43.387 --> 01:09:46.599
- So. actually. before we get to melody...

1095
01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:48.976
- ...we need to find the right chords.

1096
01:09:48.976 --> 01:09:50.895
I don't agree with Edge on that one.

1097
01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:55.274
I'm just saying. because think about
what you just did to "One."

1098
01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:56.817
You changed the chords.

1099
01:09:56.817 --> 01:09:58.694
Same melody. Same words.

1100
01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.237
- You just did it.
- Actually. I didn't.

1101
01:10:00.237 --> 01:10:02.823
We changed the key
but not the chords.

1102
01:10:02.823 --> 01:10:05.159
We did well. We nearly got to 50 years.

1103
01:10:05.159 --> 01:10:09.496
- and in Marsh's Library it all fell apart.
-  It's coming apart.

1104
01:10:09.496 --> 01:10:12.583
Well. yes.
but the fact you're still doing it.

1105
01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:14.335
and you're not tired of doing it.

1106
01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:15.794
- and you're still--

1107
01:10:15.794 --> 01:10:20.132
You know. I've certainly thought about.
um. walking away from U2.

1108
01:10:20.132 --> 01:10:22.551
- and I know every member has.
- No. No.

1109
01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:23.844
- Yeah. we've--
- No. no.

1110
01:10:23.844 --> 01:10:26.096
No. we have all thought about it.
and it's really--

1111
01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:28.390
Thought about it.
but didn't get you out the door.

1112
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:32.519
But it's really the right instinct
is to question

1113
01:10:32.519 --> 01:10:35.022
whether this should be a going concern

1114
01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:37.816
and what it demands
of all four members of U2.

1115
01:10:37.816 --> 01:10:39.068
Mm-hmm.

1116
01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:42.196
And the reason why I want to go forward is

1117
01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:46.492
because something is stirring
in my voice and in my singing.

1118
01:10:46.992 --> 01:10:50.663
And this desire to write the song
that we haven't got yet. you know?

1119
01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:54.750
We're sort of chasing the dragon
of the song we can't get.

1120
01:10:56.835 --> 01:10:59.088
{\an8}- Do you wanna hear another song?
-  Yes.

1121
01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:03.133
Let's try "Breaking Wave."
'cause we never quite nail the vocal here.

1122
01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:05.052
Let's do something completely different.

1123
01:11:06.887 --> 01:11:08.764
This is a ten-year-in-the-making song.

1124
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:17.314
<i>♪ Every breaking wave on the shore ♪</i>

1125

<i>♪ And stop chasing every breaking wave? ♪</i>

1140
01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:40.606
Uh. you know. the early songwriting
was just sketching really.

1141
01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:45.152
Sometimes. you know.
you've just started the song.

1142
01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:49.365
- and it might take 20 years to finish it.
-  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1143
01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:56.997
But then you realize this song
has been waiting for this moment.

1144
01:12:56.997 --> 01:12:58.290
Yeah.

1145
01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:03.587
