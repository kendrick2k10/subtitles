- Yeah.

167
00:11:46.613 --> 00:11:50.717
- Yeah. Harold originally
had quite a number of songs

168
00:11:50.718 --> 00:11:52.519
in that collection.

169
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.336
Wanted to call it Nightingale.

170
00:11:54.337 --> 00:11:57.095
- It's so weird that I had
no idea it even existed.

171
00:11:57.096 --> 00:11:58.929
He never mentioned it.

172
00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:01.200

173
00:12:01.201 --> 00:12:03.868

175
00:12:06.734 --> 00:12:09.978
well. we had our disagreements.

176
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:13.444
While he felt that they were
meant for just one person.

177
00:12:13.445 --> 00:12:17.445
I believe the whole world
deserved to hear them.

178

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.486

some of my originals?

181

- I want you to sing Nightingale. Artur.

182
00:12:35.105 --> 00:12:36.615
I'll be able to get a deal

183
00:12:36.616 --> 00:12:39.985

business and produce it.

184
00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:41.815

185
00:12:41.816 --> 00:12:43.991

00:12:47.724 --> 00:12:49.557
- Holzenberg material.

188
00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:53.158
- Nightingale by Arthur Holzenberg.

189
00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:55.326
heir of Harold Holzenberg.

190
00:12:56.612 --> 00:12:57.928
I can get every plugger. publisher.

191
00:12:57.929 --> 00:13:01.929
and distributor in the
business at our doorstep.

192
00:13:08.987 --> 00:13:10.095
Lunch?

193
00:13:10.096 --> 00:13:11.513
- Yeah. I'm down.

194
00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:16.472
You're gonna leave it here.

195
00:13:16.473 --> 00:13:19.428
- Yeah. I'm running low on juice.

196
00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:21.563
- But what'd your guy say?

197
00:13:21.564 --> 00:13:23.821
- He wants me to listen to his originals.

198
00:13:23.822 --> 00:13:25.637
- Good. then why don't you hear him out?

199
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:30.341
- Every Tom. Dick and
Harry has a song to sing.

200
00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:33.128
Question is. what sells?

201
00:13:33.129 --> 00:13:33.962
Come on.

202
00:13:37.996 --> 00:13:40.746
(door squeaking)

203
00:13:42.323 --> 00:13:44.906
(mellow music)

204
00:13:47.814 --> 00:13:50.564
(birds chirping)

205
00:14:03.961 --> 00:14:05.874
- Well. it doesn't look
like you got a check.

206
00:14:05.875 --> 00:14:10.875
- Arthur Holzenberg. the son
of legendary Harold Holzenberg?

207
00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:12.238
- Come on.

208
00:14:13.266 --> 00:14:15.816
- What if that's all I'll ever be?

209
00:14:15.817 --> 00:14:17.688
- One of the biggest in the business.

210
00:14:17.689 --> 00:14:19.630
pitches a label to you. right?

211
00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:22.264
A freaking record label.

212
00:14:22.265 --> 00:14:24.455
And you're just gonna turn it away.

213
00:14:24.456 --> 00:14:26.123
What are you? Insane?

214
00:14:28.214 --> 00:14:30.069
- Yeah. he wants Holzenberg.

215
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.442
but just not Arthur.

216
00:14:32.443 --> 00:14:34.411
- Suppose we get the deal. right?

217
00:14:34.412 --> 00:14:35.909
We get our foot in the door.

218
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.348
and you just do one song. one hit song.

219
00:14:39.349 --> 00:14:42.565
And then we earn the
stage to do what we want.

220
00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:44.233
what we really want.

221
00:14:52.076 --> 00:14:54.493
(TV playing)

222
00:15:04.663 --> 00:15:07.496
(dishes clanking)

223
00:15:18.358 --> 00:15:21.358
(trashcan clanking)

224
00:15:26.326 --> 00:15:27.326
- All right.

225
00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:37.194
All right.

226
00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:44.624
Man. what is this crap you're watching?

227
00:15:44.625 --> 00:15:47.125
Bon appetit. dinner is served.

228
00:15:48.619 --> 00:15:49.921
- What is this?

229
00:15:49.922 --> 00:15:54.089
- Oh. that's your favorite.
It's chicken sandwich.

230
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.373
So Dad.

231
00:16:23.281 --> 00:16:26.729
The other night. someone
actually came to see our show.

232
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.741
and they wanna pitch me to a label.

233
00:16:29.742 --> 00:16:33.909
The catch is that they
want me to play your songs.

234
00:16:39.475 --> 00:16:40.808
Did you hear me?

235
00:16:44.869 --> 00:16:46.768
Dad. I'm speaking to you.

236
00:16:46.769 --> 00:16:48.416
- I heard you fine.

237
00:16:48.417 --> 00:16:49.930
- They want me to sing your songs. Dad.

238
00:16:49.931 --> 00:16:51.348
I need your help.

239
00:16:53.785 --> 00:16:56.488
(clears throat)

240
00:16:56.489 --> 00:17:00.343
You can just stop. stop
drinking just for a second.

241
00:17:00.344 --> 00:17:01.177
Please.

242
00:17:09.344 --> 00:17:11.243
- Yeah. I'm proud of you

243
00:17:11.244 --> 00:17:16.164
cause you haven't learned a
damn thing from your old man.

244
00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:19.582
- This is a huge opportunity for me. Dad.

245
00:17:25.304 --> 00:17:26.565
Hey.

246
00:17:26.566 --> 00:17:29.463
Hey. I was talking to you.

247
00:17:29.464 --> 00:17:31.751
What is wrong with you. Dad?

248
00:17:31.752 --> 00:17:34.331
Why can't you just hear me out?

249
00:17:34.332 --> 00:17:36.165
What the hell is this?

250
00:17:43.303 --> 00:17:44.803
- Look at me. Art.

251
00:17:46.923 --> 00:17:49.237
Look what I am. (chuckles)

252
00:17:49.238 --> 00:17:51.886
Haven't you picked up anything on my life?

253
00:17:51.887 --> 00:17:55.304
- Yeah. I picked up. I picked up enough.

254
00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:01.170
It's always about what
you want. isn't it. Dad?

255
00:18:04.642 --> 00:18:05.475
Here.

256
00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:09.835
Thank you for being such a great father.

257
00:18:13.747 --> 00:18:16.330
(mellow music)

258
00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.382
(beeps)

259
00:18:35.736 --> 00:18:37.204
(crying)

260
00:18:37.205 --> 00:18:39.788
(mellow music)

261
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.983
(dishes clanking)

262
00:19:36.939 --> 00:19:39.522
(mellow music)

263
00:19:59.076 --> 00:20:01.918
(knocking)

264
00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:04.502
(upbeat music)

265
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.782
Hello

266
00:20:15.783 --> 00:20:16.615
- [Lavanya] Hey.

267
00:20:16.616 --> 00:20:18.306
- [Arthur] What's up?

268
00:20:18.307 --> 00:20:19.914
- You know the usual.

269
00:20:19.915 --> 00:20:21.564
- Oh. yeah.

270
00:20:21.565 --> 00:20:22.466
- There you go.

271
00:20:22.467 --> 00:20:23.894
- Here you go. Yeah. the usual.

272
00:20:23.895 --> 00:20:25.724
You're cut from Friday night.

273
00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.308
- Sweet. Thank you.

274
00:20:29.289 --> 00:20:31.007
(groans)

275
00:20:31.008 --> 00:20:31.936
Need that.

276
00:20:31.937 --> 00:20:33.295
- So what's up?

277
00:20:33.296 --> 00:20:35.999
- [Lavanya] Working. dude.

278
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.830
- That sounds serious.

279
00:20:37.831 --> 00:20:39.331
You care to share?

280
00:20:40.463 --> 00:20:43.046
- Finding members for our band.

281
00:20:44.197 --> 00:20:45.831
- What's wrong with the sequencer?

282
00:20:45.832 --> 00:20:48.007
- [Lavanya] Sequencers
ain’t gonna cut it. chief.

283
00:20:48.008 --> 00:20:48.840
- Come again.

284
00:20:48.841 --> 00:20:50.767
- Trust me. we don't wanna
perform all by ourselves

285
00:20:50.768 --> 00:20:53.722
when Mr. Greenfield
takes us to a record rep.

286
00:20:53.723 --> 00:20:54.556
- Okay.

287
00:20:55.691 --> 00:20:57.285
How do you plan to pay them?

288
00:20:57.286 --> 00:20:59.157
- Well. you start with
credit cards. of course.

289
00:20:59.158 --> 00:21:00.335
- [Arthur] Credit cards? (laughs)

290
00:21:00.336 --> 00:21:01.914
- Okay. no more machines.

291
00:21:01.915 --> 00:21:03.830
Musicians only.

292
00:21:03.831 --> 00:21:06.534
- La. I don't think I'm
on board with this plan.

293
00:21:06.535 --> 00:21:07.878
- Come on. dude.

294
00:21:07.879 --> 00:21:10.805
We have to step up our game plan for this.

295
00:21:10.806 --> 00:21:13.897
Did you get the album from Harold?

296
00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:16.065
- Yeah. I'm working on it.

297
00:21:17.489 --> 00:21:20.072
- You know it's the key. right?

298
00:21:22.246 --> 00:21:23.079
- Yeah.

299
00:21:25.338 --> 00:21:27.154
- When did he wanna hear him?

300
00:21:27.155 --> 00:21:29.072
- [Arthur] Three weeks.

301
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.927
- Then we better get started.

302
00:21:43.645 --> 00:21:44.978
- What happened?

303
00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:49.538
- What happened?

304
00:21:49.539 --> 00:21:51.706
You tell me what happened.

305
00:21:55.657 --> 00:21:57.990
So you get this opportunity.

306
00:22:01.287 --> 00:22:05.533
- Hey. man. I wouldn't really
call it an opportunity.

307
00:22:05.534 --> 00:22:07.221
They want me to record his songs.

308
00:22:07.222 --> 00:22:08.055
- I see.

309
00:22:11.105 --> 00:22:13.655
I just I'll never understand

310
00:22:13.656 --> 00:22:15.555
why he's such a goddamn asshole.

311
00:22:15.556 --> 00:22:18.079
- What do you know about your father?

312
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.091
Tell me.

313
00:22:19.092 --> 00:22:22.168
- He's a drunk who's
embarrassed of his own son.

314
00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:24.252
- Is that what you think?

315
00:22:25.593 --> 00:22:29.260
Back in the day. when
your father would sing

316
00:22:30.976 --> 00:22:32.181
it would be like-

317
00:22:32.182 --> 00:22:33.623
- [Audience] Holzenberg!

318
00:22:33.624 --> 00:22:35.163
Holzenberg!

319
00:22:35.164 --> 00:22:36.081
Holzenberg!

320
00:22:37.646 --> 00:22:40.210
- That was a long time ago.

321
00:22:40.211 --> 00:22:42.294
He ain’t that guy anymore.

322
00:22:43.456 --> 00:22:45.784
Your father hasn't touched his guitar

323
00:22:45.785 --> 00:22:48.558
since your mama left him.

324
00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:50.638
His concerts were canceled.

325
00:22:50.639 --> 00:22:51.889
Couldn't write.

326
00:22:52.844 --> 00:22:55.463
And he started drinking.

327
00:22:55.464 --> 00:22:57.214
And he never stopped.

328
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.440
Your father is a jackass

329
00:23:01.441 --> 00:23:05.274
because he thinks there's
nothing left inside.

330
00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:11.096
But there is an inkling
of anything. Arthur.

331
00:23:11.966 --> 00:23:14.633
you need to find out what it is.

332
00:23:18.384 --> 00:23:20.967
(mellow music)

333
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.123
(mellow music)

334
00:24:12.959 --> 00:24:15.732
(buzzing)

335
00:24:15.733 --> 00:24:16.566
- Hey.

336
00:24:22.417 --> 00:24:23.250
Arthur?

337
00:24:25.689 --> 00:24:26.936
- All right. here's the
game plan. all right?

338
00:24:26.937 --> 00:24:29.945
We're gonna get that band that you wanted.

339
00:24:29.946 --> 00:24:34.171
but we're not gonna give
Stephan what he wants.

340
00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:36.755
(upbeat music)

341
00:24:46.913 --> 00:24:49.630
Awesome. That was. that was great.

342
00:24:49.631 --> 00:24:50.463
- Really good.

343
00:24:50.464 --> 00:24:52.528
- So. what's your rate?

344
00:24:52.529 --> 00:24:56.094
- I'll do 500 for rehearsals.
1.000 for local performances.

345
00:24:56.095 --> 00:24:59.281
and then studio work and touring stuff.

346
00:24:59.282 --> 00:25:01.388
we could cut you a discount on that stuff.

347
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:03.371
If we're on the road
I'm gonna need my roadie

348
00:25:03.372 --> 00:25:04.561
and my trainer of course.

349
00:25:04.562 --> 00:25:06.812
(drumming)

350
00:25:11.644 --> 00:25:14.508
- Okay. I gotta get outta here.

351
00:25:14.509 --> 00:25:15.454
(laughing)

352
00:25:15.455 --> 00:25:17.681
- Don't leave me by myself.

353
00:25:17.682 --> 00:25:20.599
(Chinese flute playing)

354
00:25:24.855 --> 00:25:27.121
- Usually I do 1.000 per gig.

355
00:25:27.122 --> 00:25:29.478
It was a lot of 'em in a row that I can.

356
00:25:29.479 --> 00:25:30.720
you know. if I could package stuff.

357
00:25:30.721 --> 00:25:32.601
sometimes I can like trim
a little bit off the top.

358
00:25:32.602 --> 00:25:33.434
You know what I'm saying?

359
00:25:33.435 --> 00:25:35.001
- Now this is my partner
and my best friend.

360
00:25:35.002 --> 00:25:37.187
and his name is Mr. Melody.

361
00:25:37.188 --> 00:25:38.401
Say hi.

362
00:25:38.402 --> 00:25:40.652
(drumming)

363
00:25:43.522 --> 00:25:46.134
♪ Soda pop and ginger ale ♪

364
00:25:46.135 --> 00:25:49.294
♪ You cannot have any
cause you have a tail. ♪

365
00:25:49.295 --> 00:25:51.639
♪ Ginger ale and soda pop ♪

366
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.472
♪ You cannot have any
because you're a pup. ♪

367
00:25:52.473 --> 00:25:53.305
- It's actually really good

368
00:25:53.306 --> 00:25:54.138
- I'm sorry.

369
00:25:54.139 --> 00:25:56.389
(drumming)

370
00:25:57.442 --> 00:25:58.441
That was amazing.

371
00:25:58.442 --> 00:26:00.374
I don't think it's exactly
what we're going for.

372
00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:01.734
but-
- Yeah.

373
00:26:01.735 --> 00:26:03.654
- But for our international section.

374
00:26:03.655 --> 00:26:04.547
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

375
00:26:04.548 --> 00:26:06.993
- Yeah. maybe.
- Round two.

376
00:26:06.994 --> 00:26:07.826
- [Both] Chris.

377
00:26:07.827 --> 00:26:08.788
- Chris. cool.

378
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:10.052
Hey. Chris. thanks for coming in.

379
00:26:10.053 --> 00:26:10.885
- Hey. guys.

380
00:26:10.886 --> 00:26:11.718
- [Lavanya] Hi.

381
00:26:11.719 --> 00:26:12.551
- Good to see you.

382
00:26:12.552 --> 00:26:13.384
- [Arthur] Good to see you too. man.

383
00:26:13.385 --> 00:26:14.217
- Mostly you.

384
00:26:14.218 --> 00:26:15.267
- Oh.
- Oh.

385
00:26:15.268 --> 00:26:16.100
- Thank you.

386
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:16.933
(laughs)

387
00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:17.766
- Okay.

388
00:26:17.767 --> 00:26:21.509
- It's getting a little hot in here.

389
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.704
- Okay. yeah.

390
00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:23.955
Why does it say

391
00:26:25.214 --> 00:26:28.199
that you're a professional
stalker on your resume?

392
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.214
- Because my words creep up

393
00:26:30.215 --> 00:26:32.401
into your mind without you knowing.

394
00:26:32.402 --> 00:26:34.827
- Okay. you might wanna rephrase that.

395
00:26:34.828 --> 00:26:35.908
- Just one second.

396
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:37.054
- [Arthur] Take your time.

397
00:26:37.055 --> 00:26:39.679
- Darling. this is the
part where you sing. okay?

398
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.847
(barking)

399
00:26:43.089 --> 00:26:45.672
(upbeat music)

400
00:27:00.709 --> 00:27:04.401
- So you want me to perform with you

401
00:27:04.402 --> 00:27:07.681
for low to no money for three weeks.

402
00:27:07.682 --> 00:27:09.182
- Yes. maybe more.

403
00:27:12.522 --> 00:27:14.105
- Is she your girl?

404
00:27:14.949 --> 00:27:16.708
(laughs)

405
00:27:16.709 --> 00:27:17.801
- No. no. man.

406
00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:18.801
We just play together.

407
00:27:18.802 --> 00:27:20.135
She's keyboards.

408
00:27:21.256 --> 00:27:23.521
- How many more on the team?

409
00:27:23.522 --> 00:27:25.689
- Three if I count you in.

410
00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:32.391
All right.

411
00:27:32.392 --> 00:27:33.224
- I'm thirsty.

412
00:27:33.225 --> 00:27:34.057
- All right.

413
00:27:34.058 --> 00:27:35.081
Let me get you a drink. man.

414
00:27:35.082 --> 00:27:36.828
That went well.

415
00:27:36.829 --> 00:27:37.912
- Yeah. yeah.

416
00:27:39.869 --> 00:27:42.015
- He thinks you're cute.

417
00:27:42.016 --> 00:27:43.988
- Well. can you blame him?

418
00:27:43.989 --> 00:27:44.821
- Humble.

419
00:27:44.822 --> 00:27:45.788
(laughs)
- I know.

420
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:48.456
Very. that's how you have to be.

421
00:27:49.869 --> 00:27:51.786
Okay. so we've got one.

422
00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:54.949
What about bass?

423
00:27:57.482 --> 00:27:58.748
- I might know a guy.

424
00:27:58.749 --> 00:28:02.036
(upbeat music)

425
00:28:02.037 --> 00:28:04.287
(knocking)

426
00:28:07.589 --> 00:28:08.533
- Arthur?

427
00:28:08.534 --> 00:28:09.534
- Hey. Adam.

428
00:28:10.416 --> 00:28:11.468
- What you doing here?

429
00:28:11.469 --> 00:28:12.948
Oh hell. come in. come in.

430
00:28:12.949 --> 00:28:16.735
- I'll come in depending on your answer.

431
00:28:16.736 --> 00:28:18.775
- Well. I haven't heard a question.

432
00:28:18.776 --> 00:28:21.359
(upbeat music)

433
00:29:12.444 --> 00:29:14.444
(claps)

434
00:29:26.543 --> 00:29:28.115
- Good afternoon. Mr. Greenfield.

435
00:29:28.116 --> 00:29:29.797
- Here to meet Mr. Tucker.

436
00:29:29.798 --> 00:29:31.782
- Just please wait inside and
he'll be with you shortly.

437
00:29:31.783 --> 00:29:33.704
- Great. Thank you.

438
00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:35.872
(ringing)

439
00:29:41.025 --> 00:29:41.858
- Sure.

440
00:29:42.811 --> 00:29:45.311
Yeah. Saturday at one is good.

441
00:29:47.053 --> 00:29:48.477
Okay. great.

442
00:29:48.478 --> 00:29:49.311
Bye.

443
00:29:51.345 --> 00:29:52.762
Steve. what's up?

444
00:29:54.078 --> 00:29:55.411
Okay. thank you.

445
00:29:57.797 --> 00:30:00.250
- I got what you asked for.

446
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:02.370
I'll give you 30 days
to find something fresh.

447
00:30:02.371 --> 00:30:04.582
and you come back in 10.

448
00:30:04.583 --> 00:30:06.689
That's very impressive.

449
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.107
Who's our talent?

450
00:30:09.638 --> 00:30:14.221
- The son of an old friend
of mine. the heir of legend.

451
00:30:16.291 --> 00:30:17.208
- One. two.

452
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:23.100
♪ As we all wander
through a million things ♪

453
00:30:24.768 --> 00:30:29.768
♪ Striving to rise up
with our broken wings ♪

454
00:30:31.479 --> 00:30:34.170
♪ If we took a moment ♪

455
00:30:34.171 --> 00:30:35.004
- Sorry.

456
00:30:35.856 --> 00:30:36.688
Sorry.

457
00:30:36.689 --> 00:30:37.521
- It's okay.

458
00:30:37.522 --> 00:30:38.833
- So we-

459
00:30:38.834 --> 00:30:40.550
- All right.

460
00:30:40.551 --> 00:30:43.185
One more time. same place. chorus.

461
00:30:43.186 --> 00:30:44.019
One. two.

462
00:30:44.899 --> 00:30:49.899
♪ As we all wander

463
00:30:50.011 --> 00:30:51.292

464
00:30:51.293 --> 00:30:52.574
Come on. man.

465
00:30:52.575 --> 00:30:53.408
Come on.

466
00:30:54.633 --> 00:30:57.081
It's all good. It's all good.

467
00:30:57.082 --> 00:30:58.706
From the chorus. Here we go.

468
00:30:58.707 --> 00:31:03.707
♪ As we all wander

469
00:31:05.203 --> 00:31:08.572

470
00:31:08.573 --> 00:31:10.156
All right. no.

471
00:31:10.157 --> 00:31:11.250
Let's just take 10.

472
00:31:11.251 --> 00:31:12.330
Take 10.

473
00:31:12.331 --> 00:31:13.163
(tapping)

474
00:31:13.164 --> 00:31:14.331
- Smoke break!

475
00:31:22.451 --> 00:31:24.451
(sighs)

476
00:31:26.674 --> 00:31:29.257
(symbol bangs)

477
00:31:39.676 --> 00:31:41.863
- You know what. don't act
so defeated. all right?

478
00:31:41.864 --> 00:31:44.393
- Oh. you can see why I
wanted that sequencer now.

479
00:31:44.394 --> 00:31:45.550
can't you?

480
00:31:45.551 --> 00:31:46.383
- Don't start with the sequencer.

481
00:31:46.384 --> 00:31:47.254
- Start what?

482
00:31:47.255 --> 00:31:50.200
We have two days. and what
are we even doing here?

483
00:31:50.201 --> 00:31:52.480
- We're at a good pace.

484
00:31:52.481 --> 00:31:53.840
- Good's not good enough.

485
00:31:53.841 --> 00:31:55.118
- Arthur. we're not machines.

486
00:31:55.119 --> 00:31:56.667
- Exactly. Exactly.

487
00:31:56.668 --> 00:31:59.614
Because machines don't mess
up three times in a row.

488
00:31:59.615 --> 00:32:00.759
Three times.

489
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.593
- Cut them some Slack.

490
00:32:04.468 --> 00:32:06.667
Sometimes you need a
friend to lend you a hand

491
00:32:06.668 --> 00:32:10.168
when you feel low. not an iPod. all right?

492
00:32:12.995 --> 00:32:15.860
Sometimes it's nice to
give a pat on the back

493
00:32:15.861 --> 00:32:18.278
and the little. you did well.

494
00:32:20.086 --> 00:32:21.669
It helps. Trust me.

495
00:32:23.702 --> 00:32:26.285
Little kindness. little warmth.

496
00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:33.466
- Should we do it again?

497
00:32:33.467 --> 00:32:34.299
- Yeah.

498
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.116
- All right. Let's do it.

499
00:32:36.117 --> 00:32:37.380
All right. (claps)

500
00:32:37.381 --> 00:32:38.556
Let's go again.

501
00:32:38.557 --> 00:32:39.557
We got this.

502
00:32:41.903 --> 00:32:42.735
Ready?

503
00:32:42.736 --> 00:32:44.329
- Yeah. it was only half
a smoke. but whatever.

504
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.580
(laughing)

505
00:32:56.734 --> 00:32:57.567
- Yeah.

506
00:32:59.876 --> 00:33:00.793
- Hey. Dad?

507
00:33:01.968 --> 00:33:04.179
Hey. my band's playing
tomorrow for the first time.

508
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.847
and I thought you might
wanna check it out.

509
00:33:14.193 --> 00:33:15.025
All right. cool. yeah.

510
00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:15.943
Great talk.

511
00:33:20.913 --> 00:33:23.330
(door slams)

512
00:33:25.873 --> 00:33:28.456
(mellow music)

513
00:33:41.231 --> 00:33:43.084
(drink pouring)

514
00:33:43.085 --> 00:33:44.830
(dishes clanking)

515
00:33:44.831 --> 00:33:47.498
(water pouring)

516
00:33:55.807 --> 00:33:58.807
(suspenseful music)

517
00:34:08.386 --> 00:34:11.053
(water running)

518
00:34:58.286 --> 00:35:00.645
- Arthur. let me talk to you.

519
00:35:00.646 --> 00:35:01.479
- Yeah.

520
00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.592
What's up. man?

521
00:35:04.593 --> 00:35:06.391
- Does your father know about this?

522
00:35:06.392 --> 00:35:08.432
- Yeah. he doesn't care.

523
00:35:08.433 --> 00:35:11.085
- You sure about that?

524
00:35:11.086 --> 00:35:13.099
Cause him and Stephan
didn't exactly get along.

525
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.629
- Yeah. trust me. I told him.

526
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.699
and he really doesn't give a shit.

527
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.700
- All right.

528
00:35:18.673 --> 00:35:19.859
- Good luck. fellas.

529
00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.277
- Thanks. Oliver.

530
00:35:30.555 --> 00:35:31.979
- Did you talk to Stephan?

531
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.963
- Yeah.

532
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:35.099
Yeah. I told him what we talked about.

533
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.565
- He's cool with it?

534
00:35:36.566 --> 00:35:37.432
- Yeah.

535
00:35:37.433 --> 00:35:39.433
Yeah. it should be fine.

536
00:35:40.793 --> 00:35:41.685
- Okay.

537
00:35:41.686 --> 00:35:42.656
- Okay?

538
00:35:42.657 --> 00:35:43.499
- I hope it works.

539
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.192
- It is. It's gonna be great. okay?

540
00:35:45.193 --> 00:35:46.026
Trust me.

541
00:35:50.072 --> 00:35:51.219
(grunts)

542
00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.392
- They are all set.

543
00:35:53.393 --> 00:35:54.805
- What?

544
00:35:54.806 --> 00:35:57.071
- I said. they're all set.

545
00:35:57.072 --> 00:35:57.989
- Oh. okay.

546
00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.299
Here flies Nightingale.

547
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.992
(laughs)

548
00:36:02.993 --> 00:36:03.825
- All right.

549
00:36:03.826 --> 00:36:06.431
Ready when you are. guys.

550
00:36:06.432 --> 00:36:07.339
- Ready?

551
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.172
- [Will] Let's do it.

552
00:36:08.173 --> 00:36:09.029
- Here we go.

553
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:11.699
(tapping)

554
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.283
(mellow music)

555
00:36:21.633 --> 00:36:26.335
♪ From time to time we
tend to get a little lost ♪

556
00:36:26.336 --> 00:36:27.169
- Stop it.

557
00:36:37.035 --> 00:36:38.972
What the hell is this. Arthur?

558
00:36:38.973 --> 00:36:39.805
- I just-

559
00:36:39.806 --> 00:36:42.559
- I'm not here to listen to this.

560
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.117
I thought I was very clear
with what we're here for.

561
00:36:45.118 --> 00:36:46.132
- You were. and I just thought-

562
00:36:46.133 --> 00:36:51.133
- My job is two words. What. Sells.

563
00:36:51.413 --> 00:36:54.052
Do you have any idea what
I have in store for you?

564
00:36:54.053 --> 00:36:56.212
This is a waste of my freaking time.

565
00:36:56.213 --> 00:36:57.237
Adam. was this your-

566
00:36:57.238 --> 00:36:58.070
- No. no. no. no. no.

567
00:36:58.071 --> 00:37:00.799
I just thought if you
heard our song. you would.

568
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.199
Man. just give us a chance.

569
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.200
- Did I not?

570
00:37:04.293 --> 00:37:06.210
You don't belong here.

571
00:37:10.267 --> 00:37:13.350
- What the hell is going on. Arthur?

572
00:37:18.173 --> 00:37:21.439
- So. before you guys joined the band.

573
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.718
Stephan Greenfield came
to one of our gigs.

574
00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:27.145
and he approached me and gave me a card.

575
00:37:27.146 --> 00:37:28.919
Wanted to take a meeting.

576
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.587
So. I jumped at the opportunity.

577
00:37:32.432 --> 00:37:35.182
I thought this was my big break.

578
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.850
But it turns out he wanted me to record

579
00:37:41.026 --> 00:37:42.239
one of my dad's albums.

580
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.612
an album I never even heard of it before.

581
00:37:44.613 --> 00:37:46.946
an album called Nightingale.

582
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.946
But man. after we talked that night.

583
00:37:49.947 --> 00:37:51.946
I knew I couldn't do that.

584
00:37:51.947 --> 00:37:56.106
I knew that I had a play
some of my original stuff

585
00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:57.940
and just not tell 'em.

586
00:38:02.904 --> 00:38:06.359
I'm sorry. I didn't tell you guys really.

587
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.266
I guess I blew that.

588
00:38:08.267 --> 00:38:10.850
(ringtone)

589
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.990
- Let me talk to him.

590
00:38:26.987 --> 00:38:29.320
Give me a second. all right?

591
00:38:37.147 --> 00:38:41.230
So you never heard of the
Nightingale collection?

592
00:38:43.147 --> 00:38:44.147
- No. I did.

593
00:38:45.693 --> 00:38:47.776
- What. it was that bad?

594
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.937
- No. man. it was incredible.

595
00:38:54.344 --> 00:38:55.177
It's just.

596
00:38:58.067 --> 00:38:59.903
it's not mine.

597
00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:01.904
- So that's the problem.

598
00:39:07.417 --> 00:39:09.417
You ever sailed. Arthur?

599
00:39:12.577 --> 00:39:14.744
You know. when I was young

600
00:39:16.509 --> 00:39:18.092
I waited on a boat.

601
00:39:19.377 --> 00:39:22.294
big and beautiful. the perfect one.

602
00:39:24.532 --> 00:39:26.106
I mean. many boats came by.

603
00:39:26.107 --> 00:39:29.190
but nothing was ever what I expected.

604
00:39:30.823 --> 00:39:34.019
But then one day she come in.

605
00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.542
the Titanic of 'em all.

606
00:39:36.543 --> 00:39:40.182
I mean. she exceeded all my expectations.

607
00:39:40.183 --> 00:39:44.350
but I told myself. maybe
there's something better.

608
00:39:45.943 --> 00:39:47.526
So I chose to wait.

609
00:39:48.768 --> 00:39:50.073
Now many people said. Adam.

610
00:39:50.074 --> 00:39:52.742
ain’t nothing better ever is gonna come.

611
00:39:52.743 --> 00:39:55.743
but I stood my ground. and I waited.

612
00:39:58.277 --> 00:39:59.360
and I waited.

613
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:03.210
and I waited

614
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.153
until I looked up one day

615
00:40:07.154 --> 00:40:10.809
and I saw that I had gray in my beard

616
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.227
and the wrinkles on my face.

617
00:40:14.543 --> 00:40:18.126
You was Harold's son
before you was Arthur.

618
00:40:21.794 --> 00:40:24.544
The compromise might be worth it.

619
00:40:29.814 --> 00:40:31.981
I'll see ya later. Junior.

620
00:40:34.217 --> 00:40:36.050
- See you later. Adam.

621
00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:41.386
(ringtone)

622
00:40:47.097 --> 00:40:49.514
(TV playing)

623
00:41:03.683 --> 00:41:04.516
Hey. Dad!

624
00:41:09.337 --> 00:41:10.170
Hey. Dad!

625
00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:14.470
(door squeaks)

626
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.109
(door slams)

627
00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.482
Hey. Dad.

628
00:41:27.483 --> 00:41:28.316
Dad!

629
00:41:29.181 --> 00:41:30.014
Shh. Dad!

630
00:41:31.507 --> 00:41:32.964
Dad!

631
00:41:32.965 --> 00:41:34.172
Dad!

632
00:41:34.173 --> 00:41:36.506
Okay. come on. Dad. Come on.

633
00:41:37.857 --> 00:41:38.896
All right.

634
00:41:38.897 --> 00:41:40.987
(phone dialing)

635
00:41:40.988 --> 00:41:43.536
(ringing)

636
00:41:43.537 --> 00:41:45.922
- [Phone] 911. what's the
nature of your emergency?

637
00:41:45.923 --> 00:41:48.756
(sirens ringing)

638
00:41:53.587 --> 00:41:55.122
- Did he not mention any of this?

639
00:41:55.123 --> 00:41:55.956
- No.

640
00:41:57.515 --> 00:42:00.736
- Well. I can't promise the
outcome of a transplant surgery

641
00:42:00.737 --> 00:42:01.847
considering his age.

642
00:42:01.848 --> 00:42:02.976
- Is he?

643
00:42:02.977 --> 00:42:04.567
- He's still unconscious.

644
00:42:04.568 --> 00:42:06.246
We have to treat the encephalopathy coma

645
00:42:06.247 --> 00:42:09.328
before we can even consider the surgery.

646
00:42:09.329 --> 00:42:10.368
Make up your mind.

647
00:42:10.369 --> 00:42:12.367
You have to get them on a donor list ASAP.

648
00:42:12.368 --> 00:42:14.446
- Well. how long will it
be til he finds a donor?

649
00:42:14.447 --> 00:42:16.368
- Months. weeks if we're lucky.

650
00:42:16.369 --> 00:42:18.536
It's hard to say for sure.

651
00:42:19.633 --> 00:42:21.715
- Yeah. let's move forward.

652
00:42:21.716 --> 00:42:24.221
- [Doctor] All right.
sign the consent forms.

653
00:42:24.222 --> 00:42:25.808
and bring me his medical records

654
00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:29.892
and someone will talk to
you about the insurance.

655
00:42:33.369 --> 00:42:35.536
(beeping)

656
00:42:53.461 --> 00:42:56.369
(dialing)

657
00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:58.537
(ringing)

658
00:43:04.237 --> 00:43:08.049
- [Stephan] This is Stephan
with Reindeer Music.

659
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:09.217
- It's Arthur.

660
00:43:10.944 --> 00:43:13.196
- [Stephan] You have three seconds.

661
00:43:13.197 --> 00:43:14.697
- I have the album

662
00:43:17.236 --> 00:43:20.290
(laughing)

663
00:43:20.291 --> 00:43:22.356
- Someone's early.

664
00:43:22.357 --> 00:43:23.636
- As always.

665
00:43:23.637 --> 00:43:24.836
- Oh really?

666
00:43:24.837 --> 00:43:25.783
(laughing)

667
00:43:25.784 --> 00:43:29.690
When in your land always
basically means never. right?

668
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:30.916
- So what's the plan.

669
00:43:30.917 --> 00:43:35.084
- Oh. the plan. my punctual
friend is to practice.

670
00:43:36.557 --> 00:43:37.743
- I gave it a listen.

671
00:43:37.744 --> 00:43:38.623
- [Lavanya] And?

672
00:43:38.624 --> 00:43:39.660
- [Will] It's dope.

673
00:43:39.661 --> 00:43:40.823
- He likes it.

674
00:43:40.824 --> 00:43:41.822
(laughing)

675
00:43:41.823 --> 00:43:44.250
- [Lavanya] We've got his approval.

676
00:43:44.251 --> 00:43:46.063
- [Arthur] All right. count us in.

677
00:43:46.064 --> 00:43:48.314
(ticking)

678
00:43:54.554 --> 00:43:56.637
- [Lavanya] Is he asleep?

679
00:43:57.726 --> 00:43:58.976
- No. I'm dead.

680
00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:02.271
(laughing)

681
00:44:05.233 --> 00:44:06.065
(piano playing)

682
00:44:06.066 --> 00:44:08.220
- Ooh. I love that.

683
00:44:08.221 --> 00:44:10.888
(piano playing)

684
00:44:15.425 --> 00:44:17.146
- [Stephan] Hey!

685
00:44:17.147 --> 00:44:18.536
How we doing?

686
00:44:18.537 --> 00:44:20.535
- Mr. Greenfield.

687
00:44:20.536 --> 00:44:21.775
- [Stephan] Working hard. I see. huh?

688
00:44:21.776 --> 00:44:23.042
- Yeah. yeah.

689
00:44:23.043 --> 00:44:24.320
- How's it coming along?

690
00:44:24.321 --> 00:44:25.229
- Nearly perfect.

691
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.149
- Better be.

692
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.961
(laughing)

693
00:44:27.962 --> 00:44:28.795
Good news.

694
00:44:30.923 --> 00:44:33.840
The label loved the tracks we sent.

695
00:44:35.243 --> 00:44:38.413
- I see Christmas coming early this year.

696
00:44:38.414 --> 00:44:41.109
- Well. it gets even better.

697
00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:44.362
An executive wants to hear
the band perform live.

698
00:44:44.363 --> 00:44:45.309
- Wow.

699
00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:47.096
(muttering)

700
00:44:47.097 --> 00:44:48.176
- Thursday.

701
00:44:48.177 --> 00:44:49.010
- Oh. wow.

702
00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:52.683
- That's like in three days.

703
00:44:55.923 --> 00:44:58.509
- Artists may want freedom.

704
00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:00.615
but what they need are deadlines.

705
00:45:00.616 --> 00:45:02.027
- It's just not enough time.

706
00:45:02.028 --> 00:45:04.709
- Thought you said it was perfect.

707
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:07.043
- I said it's getting there.

708
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:10.210
- Nervous. Arthur?

709
00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:13.247
- No. not at all.

710
00:45:14.375 --> 00:45:15.792
- What can I say?

711
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:21.290
If he's convinced he might
sign a deal then and there.

712
00:45:26.243 --> 00:45:30.826
- Well. I guess we better
get back to work then. right?

713
00:45:32.203 --> 00:45:35.453
Thanks for stopping by. Mr. Greenfield.

714
00:45:36.937 --> 00:45:39.437

715
00:46:05.077 --> 00:46:07.244
(beeping)

716
00:46:30.234 --> 00:46:34.982
- I wish you were there
to see my band play. Dad.

717
00:46:34.983 --> 00:46:37.407

- Loud and clear.

737
00:48:00.267 --> 00:48:02.103
- [Oliver] Yep.

738
00:48:02.104 --> 00:48:03.586
I'm still hearing a hum.

739
00:48:03.587 --> 00:48:05.754
- Yeah. Yeah. me too. man.

740
00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.757
Shit. okay.

741
00:48:10.027 --> 00:48:12.114
We better get this squared
away before four. right?

742
00:48:12.115 --> 00:48:13.826
- Oh. well thank you Captain Obvious.

743
00:48:13.827 --> 00:48:15.946
You never fail to save the day. do you?

744
00:48:15.947 --> 00:48:18.356
- All right. man. let's
just get this squared up.

745
00:48:18.357 --> 00:48:19.904
All right. coming in.

746
00:48:19.905 --> 00:48:22.072
(beeping)

747
00:48:57.318 --> 00:48:59.928
- Yeah. we should be set.

748
00:48:59.929 --> 00:49:01.429
That should do it.

749
00:49:02.598 --> 00:49:04.531
Call me crazy.

750
00:49:04.532 --> 00:49:06.782
Reset input to two and bam.

751
00:49:09.318 --> 00:49:10.150
That should do it.

752
00:49:10.151 --> 00:49:12.476
- Yup. Yup. I don't hear anything now.

753
00:49:12.477 --> 00:49:13.315
- Cool.

754
00:49:13.316 --> 00:49:14.784
Always know what I'm doing sometimes.

755
00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:17.504
(groans)
(laughing)

756
00:49:17.505 --> 00:49:19.944
- Oh. man. I hope this goes well today.

757
00:49:19.945 --> 00:49:21.862
- Yeah. me too. Me too.

758
00:49:22.704 --> 00:49:25.342
Let me ask you something.

759
00:49:25.343 --> 00:49:26.676
What drives you?

760
00:49:27.625 --> 00:49:30.542
What inspires you. keeps you going?

761
00:49:33.443 --> 00:49:36.864
- I don't know. man. (laughs)

762
00:49:36.865 --> 00:49:38.365
I guess it's just.

763
00:49:41.638 --> 00:49:44.491
I don't know. it's hard to put into words.

764
00:49:44.492 --> 00:49:48.575
I wake up every morning
and it's what I wanna do.

765
00:49:50.092 --> 00:49:51.876
When I get up it's all I think about.

766
00:49:51.877 --> 00:49:55.437
It consumes me.
(mellow music)

767
00:49:55.438 --> 00:49:58.271
It's like. it's like an obsession.

768
00:50:01.305 --> 00:50:02.472
- That's nice.

769
00:50:03.905 --> 00:50:06.744
That's actually really inspiring.

770
00:50:06.745 --> 00:50:09.531
You pursue what you want.

771
00:50:09.532 --> 00:50:10.782
- Don't we all?

772
00:50:13.113 --> 00:50:13.946
- No.

773
00:50:16.515 --> 00:50:17.682
Not all of us.

774
00:50:21.116 --> 00:50:22.283
Not all of us.

775
00:50:26.198 --> 00:50:28.115
So do not mess this up.

776
00:50:29.798 --> 00:50:31.715
- I'll do my best. man.

777
00:50:32.598 --> 00:50:34.637
- All right. brother.

778
00:50:34.638 --> 00:50:37.221
(ringtone)

779
00:50:38.892 --> 00:50:40.392
- Excuse me a sec.

780
00:50:42.664 --> 00:50:43.497
Hello?

781
00:50:47.585 --> 00:50:50.335
(dramatic music)

782
00:50:52.798 --> 00:50:54.424
Hey Adam. will you help me with this. bro?

783
00:50:54.425 --> 00:50:55.257
- Yeah.

784
00:50:55.258 --> 00:50:56.424
♪ I feel the rain ♪

785
00:50:56.425 --> 00:50:58.184
♪ I hear the thunder ♪

786
00:50:58.185 --> 00:50:59.017
- Where you want it?

787
00:50:59.018 --> 00:50:59.850
- Just right up here.

788
00:50:59.851 --> 00:51:01.984
- Where's Arthur?

789
00:51:01.985 --> 00:51:04.997
- I thought he was with you.

790
00:51:04.998 --> 00:51:06.088
- No.

791
00:51:06.089 --> 00:51:07.196
- Hypovolemic shock.

792
00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:08.029
- Yeah. but if he needs blood.

793
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.874
why aren't you giving it to him?

794
00:51:08.875 --> 00:51:10.651
- He's AB negative.

795
00:51:10.652 --> 00:51:12.069
We need to donor.

796
00:51:15.705 --> 00:51:18.051
- You said he was here
earlier today. right. Oliver?

797
00:51:18.052 --> 00:51:19.597
- [Oliver] Yes I did. Lavanya.

798
00:51:19.598 --> 00:51:20.501
I have no idea where he's at.

799
00:51:20.502 --> 00:51:22.157
- It's Lavanya. but whatever.

800
00:51:22.158 --> 00:51:22.990
- [Oliver] Oh. whatever.

801
00:51:22.991 --> 00:51:24.454
- Yeah. don't give me that. okay?

802
00:51:24.455 --> 00:51:25.288
My god.

803
00:51:29.143 --> 00:51:30.451
Nope. can't reach him.

804
00:51:30.452 --> 00:51:32.397
- Stop freaking out.

805
00:51:32.398 --> 00:51:33.651
- [Lavanya] Okay. that helps.

806
00:51:33.652 --> 00:51:34.744
- Should I go to his house.

807
00:51:34.745 --> 00:51:36.143
- [Lavanya] No. no. they're
almost gonna be here.

808
00:51:36.144 --> 00:51:37.561
There's no point.

809
00:51:40.705 --> 00:51:41.705
- Hey. guys.

810
00:51:42.758 --> 00:51:46.677
This is Mr. Robert Tucker
from Sungoria Records.

811
00:51:46.678 --> 00:51:47.510
- [Lavanya] Hi!

812
00:51:47.511 --> 00:51:48.343
- How do you do?

813
00:51:48.344 --> 00:51:50.731
- [Lavanya] Good. good.
It's lovely to meet you.

814
00:51:50.732 --> 00:51:52.504
- Yeah. nice to be here.

815
00:51:52.505 --> 00:51:53.384
- [Lavanya] Thank you so much

816
00:51:53.385 --> 00:51:55.131
for giving us this opportunity.

817
00:51:55.132 --> 00:51:56.904
- Yeah. my pleasure.

818
00:51:56.905 --> 00:51:59.568
Well. good luck. gentlemen and lady.

819
00:51:59.569 --> 00:52:01.397
- [Lavanya] Thank you.

820
00:52:01.398 --> 00:52:03.301
Everything going well?

821
00:52:03.302 --> 00:52:04.874
- Yeah.

822
00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:06.011
- Yeah. Oliver. why don't you take

823
00:52:06.012 --> 00:52:08.345
Mr. Tucker up to the suite.

824
00:52:09.558 --> 00:52:12.517
Walk them up there while I set
things up here on the stage.

825
00:52:12.518 --> 00:52:13.350
- Absolutely.

826
00:52:13.351 --> 00:52:14.556
- Yeah. great.

827
00:52:14.557 --> 00:52:15.930
- You guys good? You
have everything you need?

828
00:52:15.931 --> 00:52:17.917
- [Lavanya] Yeah. Thank you so much.

829
00:52:17.918 --> 00:52:18.750
- Okay.

830
00:52:18.751 --> 00:52:20.704
- [Lavanya] Just a few
minutes to prep. That's it.

831
00:52:20.705 --> 00:52:21.537
- Take your time.

832
00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:22.491
- [Lavanya] Thanks.

833
00:52:22.492 --> 00:52:23.783
- Great. great. Thanks.

834
00:52:23.784 --> 00:52:24.617
Okay.

835
00:52:29.516 --> 00:52:31.266
Where the hell is he?

836
00:52:33.278 --> 00:52:36.361
- Come on. come on. come on. come on.

837
00:52:37.518 --> 00:52:42.185
- [Audio] I'm sorry. the
person you are trying to reach.

838
00:52:44.598 --> 00:52:46.472
- Where's your star. Steve?

839
00:52:46.473 --> 00:52:49.331
- Yeah. he should be
walking in any second.

840
00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:51.531
Any second. yeah.

841
00:52:51.532 --> 00:52:53.584
- I'm leaving in five.

842
00:52:53.585 --> 00:52:55.481
- Okay. just give it a five more.

843
00:52:55.482 --> 00:52:58.648
Oliver. you wanna set up
the board in a way. please?

844
00:52:58.649 --> 00:52:59.481
- Yes. sir.

845
00:52:59.482 --> 00:53:01.624
- Thanks. thanks.

846
00:53:01.625 --> 00:53:03.611
So maybe I'll just make a quick call.

847
00:53:03.612 --> 00:53:05.944
make sure that there's no problems.

848
00:53:05.945 --> 00:53:07.117
You know LA traffic.

849
00:53:07.118 --> 00:53:09.451
- Please. no excuses. Steve.

850
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:15.784
- [Stephan] Can I get you
something while we're waiting?

851
00:53:15.785 --> 00:53:18.785
(suspenseful music)

852
00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:36.103
I'm going to make a quick call.

853
00:53:40.173 --> 00:53:41.423
- Sorry. sorry.

854
00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.127
- Where were you?

855
00:53:46.128 --> 00:53:47.064
- Sorry.

856
00:53:47.065 --> 00:53:48.304
Sorry!

857
00:53:48.305 --> 00:53:49.305
- He's here.

858
00:53:50.358 --> 00:53:51.489
- He's late.

859
00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:53.077
- Yes. he's late.

860
00:53:53.078 --> 00:53:55.384
I'll give him a good talking to.

861
00:53:55.385 --> 00:53:57.302
Don't worry about that.

862
00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.468
- Okay.

863
00:54:06.469 --> 00:54:08.052

You okay?

865
00:54:12.211 --> 00:54:13.043

- Yeah.

867

- [Oliver] Yes.

869
00:54:18.825 --> 00:54:21.130
- Okay. Oliver. would you
please just see if they're ready

870
00:54:21.131 --> 00:54:22.964

871

898
00:57:36.714 --> 00:57:39.007
- He's a Holzenberg.

899
00:57:39.008 --> 00:57:41.008
He's not the Holzenberg.

907
00:58:00.887 --> 00:58:03.167
This can't be happening.

908
00:58:03.168 --> 00:58:05.001
It's a safety blanket.

909
00:58:05.861 --> 00:58:08.140
They were not published anyway.

910
00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:09.913
Besides actors do this all the time.

911
00:58:09.914 --> 00:58:12.497
- Yeah. well. I'm not an actor.

912
00:58:13.408 --> 00:58:15.647
- Let me get this straight.

913
00:58:15.648 --> 00:58:19.500
You want us to pretend
that we did the song.

914
00:58:19.501 --> 00:58:20.752
- And take credit for it.

915
00:58:20.753 --> 00:58:23.379
- [Adam] Steal Harold's stuff.

916
00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:26.533

00:58:29.975 --> 00:58:32.058
(groans)

919
00:58:33.385 --> 00:58:36.427
- Okay. yeah. Now I see
where your head's at.

920
00:58:36.428 --> 00:58:37.906
So you want me to mime

921
00:58:37.907 --> 00:58:40.161
some remastered version
of my father's song?

922
00:58:40.162 --> 00:58:42.066
Do you have any idea
how insulting that is?

923
00:58:42.067 --> 00:58:43.627
- Forget it. Let's just go.

924
00:58:43.628 --> 00:58:44.460
- Good call.

925
00:58:44.461 --> 00:58:45.598
Let's go back to the bar.

926
00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:47.571
wait for another Robert Tucker to show up.

927
00:58:47.572 --> 00:58:49.072
Happens every day.

928
00:58:49.959 --> 00:58:52.959
Why don't we ask Adam about it. huh?

929
00:58:56.932 --> 00:58:58.611
- If you choose not to speak up.

930
00:58:58.612 --> 00:59:01.358
we'll have to assume that
you support this nonsense.

931
00:59:01.359 --> 00:59:04.276
- The decision has to be unanimous.

932
00:59:06.012 --> 00:59:08.345
- It's a line I can't cross.

933
00:59:12.385 --> 00:59:15.556
- Do you understand the
bigger picture here?

934
00:59:15.557 --> 00:59:17.583
- Don't even answer him. man.

935
00:59:17.584 --> 00:59:20.904
I'm tired of listening to this clown.

936
00:59:20.905 --> 00:59:23.238
- Yeah. you walk out that door. then what?

937
00:59:23.239 --> 00:59:25.406
- That's not your concern.

938
00:59:26.662 --> 00:59:29.024
- Can I have a second with you?

939
00:59:29.025 --> 00:59:31.278
- No. Stephan. have a
second with all of us.

940
00:59:31.279 --> 00:59:34.112
All right? I'm not here by myself.

941
00:59:37.345 --> 00:59:38.178
- Um...

942
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:45.384
What do you think Harold
would want for his son?

943
00:59:45.385 --> 00:59:48.104
- This is not about Harold.

944
00:59:48.105 --> 00:59:49.878
It's about Arthur.

945
00:59:49.879 --> 00:59:50.984
It's about Lavanya.

946
00:59:50.985 --> 00:59:52.571
It's about Will.

947
00:59:52.572 --> 00:59:54.371
It's about me.

948
00:59:54.372 --> 00:59:56.622
Hell. it's even about you.

949
00:59:57.985 --> 01:00:01.184
We're the ones that's
gonna have to live with it.

950
01:00:01.185 --> 01:00:03.102
Do you understand that?

951
01:00:05.984 --> 01:00:08.651
(slow clapping)

952
01:00:16.199 --> 01:00:19.616
- You just threw your future to the curb.

953
01:00:23.932 --> 01:00:26.599
(cars rumbling)

954
01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:32.545
- Hello. sir.

955
01:00:35.074 --> 01:00:38.657
I'm Katherine with Milo
and Milo Insurance.

956
01:00:39.582 --> 01:00:42.128
I believe you are Mr. Holzenberg's son.

957
01:00:42.129 --> 01:00:42.961
- Yeah.

958
01:00:42.962 --> 01:00:44.128
- Is it a good time to talk?

959
01:00:44.129 --> 01:00:45.212
- Yeah. yeah.

960
01:00:46.729 --> 01:00:50.395
- I'm here to talk about the
coverage for Mr. Holzenberg.

961
01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:51.515
- Is there a problem?

962
01:00:51.516 --> 01:00:52.933
- Absolutely not.

963
01:00:54.476 --> 01:00:57.976
Just need to confirm certain details. sir.

964
01:01:03.356 --> 01:01:06.661
You said your father was in rehab twice

965
01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:08.912
for his addiction. correct?

966
01:01:11.556 --> 01:01:15.075
The doctor mentioned that he
had advised surgery earlier.

967
01:01:15.076 --> 01:01:18.076
Did you have any knowledge about it?

968
01:01:27.462 --> 01:01:28.861
(door slams)

969
01:01:28.862 --> 01:01:29.899
- Hi.

970
01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.701
Here to see Mr. Tucker.

971
01:01:31.702 --> 01:01:35.119
- Sure. Give me a second. Mr. Greenfield.

972
01:01:37.916 --> 01:01:38.749
Yeah.

973
01:01:39.969 --> 01:01:41.755
Mr. Greenfield.

974
01:01:41.756 --> 01:01:43.208
Okay.

975
01:01:43.209 --> 01:01:44.042
Thanks.

976
01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:50.087
I'm sorry. but unfortunately
he's unavailable at the moment.

977
01:01:50.088 --> 01:01:51.968
Would you like to leave a message?

978
01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:53.886
- I had an appointment.

979
01:01:55.515 --> 01:01:58.432
- As I said. he's unavailable. sir.

980
01:02:09.404 --> 01:02:11.987
(car rumbling)

981
01:02:13.892 --> 01:02:16.059
(beeping)

982
01:02:34.797 --> 01:02:37.316
- What are you doing here?

983
01:02:37.317 --> 01:02:39.817
- Just checking on an old pal.

984
01:02:45.957 --> 01:02:48.329
What'd the doc say?

985
01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:52.163
- He needs to have a
liver transplant surgery.

986
01:02:54.307 --> 01:02:56.390
- Well. sounds expensive.

987
01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:02.401
How do you plan to pay for it?

988
01:03:02.402 --> 01:03:05.835
That's not your area of
concern. Mr. Greenfield.

989
01:03:05.836 --> 01:03:08.276
- You're absolutely right.

990
01:03:08.277 --> 01:03:11.110
Harold's health is not my concern.

991
01:03:12.383 --> 01:03:13.466
Shouldn't be.

992
01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:18.702
Last I checked. insurance doesn't pay

993
01:03:18.703 --> 01:03:21.036
for someone who is suicidal.

994
01:03:22.877 --> 01:03:27.460
or a chronic alcoholic who
dragged himself to this bed.

995
01:03:32.797 --> 01:03:34.929
- I'll take out a loan.

996
01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:35.763
Charity.

997
01:03:37.402 --> 01:03:38.377
I'll do whatever I have to do.

998
01:03:38.378 --> 01:03:41.607
I'll sell the house if I have to.

999
01:03:41.608 --> 01:03:43.775
- Sure. You could do that.

1000
01:03:45.943 --> 01:03:50.610
Or you can be the reason your
old man gets up and walks.

1001
01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:00.419
$90.000.

1002
01:04:03.867 --> 01:04:04.867
One single.

1003
01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.680
- All right.

1004
01:04:28.707 --> 01:04:29.624
One single.

1005
01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:33.226
in exchange for the entirety
of his medical bills.

1006
01:04:33.227 --> 01:04:37.106
All right. not a penny
more. not a penny less.

1007
01:04:37.107 --> 01:04:38.774
There'll be no team.

1008
01:04:41.347 --> 01:04:44.770
I'll take full responsibility
for everything.

1009
01:04:44.771 --> 01:04:47.104
I'll make sure no one talks.

1010
01:04:52.253 --> 01:04:53.086
- Deal.

1011
01:04:55.427 --> 01:04:57.732
- I think I just made
a deal with the devil.

1012
01:04:57.733 --> 01:04:59.599
- Yeah. but who'd even believe you?

1013
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.433
- I agree.

1014
01:05:01.504 --> 01:05:02.731
This might ruin your career.

1015
01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:06.315
- Yeah. well. I gotta
take the chance. man.

1016
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.157
- It's a stretch.

1017
01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:16.079
- Yeah. well. what are
my options here. bro?

1018
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.372
- What about we publish our own stuff?

1019
01:05:19.373 --> 01:05:20.997
- Yeah. like I haven't tried that already.

1020
01:05:20.998 --> 01:05:21.959
- We've tried that.

1021
01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.351
- It's not an option. bro.

1022
01:05:24.352 --> 01:05:26.185
- Say you do it. then?

1023
01:05:28.933 --> 01:05:30.879
- I don't know. man. we do the job.

1024
01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.666
All right. we get the money.

1025
01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:37.012
and then sooner or later we
can do what we actually do.

1026
01:05:37.013 --> 01:05:37.845
Right?

1027
01:05:37.846 --> 01:05:39.277
- Whatever it takes?

1028
01:05:39.278 --> 01:05:41.445
- Gotta do it for my dad.

1029
01:05:44.212 --> 01:05:45.959
- Whatever it takes.

1030
01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.043
(groans)

1031
01:05:49.147 --> 01:05:49.980
- Me too.

1032
01:05:51.093 --> 01:05:53.052
Me too. Let's do it together.

1033
01:05:53.053 --> 01:05:55.470
- No. no. you guys are alright.

1034
01:05:56.373 --> 01:05:58.330
It's asking too much.

1035
01:05:58.331 --> 01:06:00.066
- You're not asking.

1036
01:06:00.067 --> 01:06:04.484
Something that I can do for
Mr. Holzenberg. as a fan.

1037
01:06:08.451 --> 01:06:10.784
- You know I'm in. Come on.

1038
01:06:18.293 --> 01:06:19.852
- Who ate my slice?

1039
01:06:19.853 --> 01:06:20.839
(laughs)

1040
01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:24.257
- You'll do it for a friend. right. Adam?

1041
01:06:29.773 --> 01:06:32.172
- [Announcer] The heir of a
once famous country singer

1042
01:06:32.173 --> 01:06:35.466
has stepped forward to
revive the legends name.

1043
01:06:35.467 --> 01:06:37.399
Arthur Holzenberg.

1044
01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.799
the son of the one and
only Harold Holzenberg.

1045
01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.532
shines and his new single Nightingale.

1046
01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:45.063
If you guys haven't heard the song yet.

1047
01:06:45.064 --> 01:06:46.660
it's very heartwarming.

1048
01:06:46.661 --> 01:06:48.623
I think it'll be at the top of the charts

1049
01:06:48.624 --> 01:06:50.688
for quite some time.

1050
01:06:50.689 --> 01:06:52.303
(jazz music)

1051
01:06:52.304 --> 01:06:53.437
- [Arthur] You all
right there. Adam buddy?

1052
01:06:53.438 --> 01:06:54.370
- [Adam] I feel great.

1053
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:55.983
I feel great. I feel great!

1054
01:06:55.984 --> 01:06:56.816
(laughing)

1055
01:06:56.817 --> 01:06:57.828
- [Arthur] Slow down. man.

1056
01:06:57.829 --> 01:07:02.829
- I cannot believe that we
sold 18.000 copies in a week.

1057
01:07:03.191 --> 01:07:04.023
- Yeah!

1058
01:07:04.024 --> 01:07:04.856
Here here!

1059
01:07:04.857 --> 01:07:05.689
- Proud of you. my brother.

1060
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:06.522
- Yeah!

1061
01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:07.980
- It was worth it.

1062
01:07:07.981 --> 01:07:10.037
Christmas really did come early this year.

1063
01:07:10.038 --> 01:07:12.277
(laughing)

1064
01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:13.450
Thank you.

1065
01:07:13.451 --> 01:07:15.868
(jazz music)

1066
01:07:17.478 --> 01:07:19.023
- It's one o'clock already?

1067
01:07:19.024 --> 01:07:19.981
- One more!

1068
01:07:19.982 --> 01:07:21.677
- [Adam] Na. na. na. no more.

1069
01:07:21.678 --> 01:07:22.850
- Just one. One more.

1070
01:07:22.851 --> 01:07:24.183
Come on. it's celebration time.

1071
01:07:24.184 --> 01:07:25.016
- [Adam] No more.

1072
01:07:25.017 --> 01:07:26.770
We keep this up. we'll be
driving these guys home.

1073
01:07:26.771 --> 01:07:29.188
- Next time. we'll sell more.

1074
01:07:30.024 --> 01:07:33.357
- Next time we'll sell something better.

1075
01:07:34.664 --> 01:07:36.063
- We'll sell it all.

1076
01:07:36.064 --> 01:07:37.637
(laughing)

1077
01:07:37.638 --> 01:07:39.782
We'll sell all of it.

1078
01:07:39.783 --> 01:07:43.866
Arthur. you and me will
be millionaires together.

1079
01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:47.703
- All right. calm down there. captain.

1080
01:07:47.704 --> 01:07:49.503
It's my turn now.

1081
01:07:49.504 --> 01:07:50.504
- Here here!

1082
01:07:52.544 --> 01:07:53.722
- Here here.

1083
01:07:53.723 --> 01:07:54.806
Dare tell me.

1084
01:07:59.691 --> 01:08:02.608
Dare tell the captain to calm down?

1085
01:08:04.975 --> 01:08:05.810
Huh?

1086
01:08:05.811 --> 01:08:07.797
- All right. that's enough.

1087
01:08:07.798 --> 01:08:09.050
Arthur. he's drunk.

1088
01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:11.051
- [Stephan] Aw. come on.

1089
01:08:11.971 --> 01:08:14.721
(Stephan laughs)

1090
01:08:17.011 --> 01:08:17.928
- Come on.

1091
01:08:18.771 --> 01:08:20.104
Let's call this.

1092
01:08:21.358 --> 01:08:23.525
(beeping)

1093
01:08:30.211 --> 01:08:32.794
(ringtone)

1094
01:08:39.307 --> 01:08:41.057
- Hey. look who's up.

1095
01:08:42.162 --> 01:08:43.495
You're out for a while there.

1096
01:08:43.496 --> 01:08:45.748
I was worried about you.

1097
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:46.853
- Yeah. sorry Art.

1098
01:08:46.854 --> 01:08:47.687
- Come on.

1099
01:08:48.669 --> 01:08:52.615
- No. I'm sorry for all the
trouble I'm putting you through.

1100
01:08:52.616 --> 01:08:54.788
- I'm sure I beat you
at it when I was six.

1101
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:57.508
(laughing)

1102
01:08:57.509 --> 01:08:59.259
- You were a handful.

1103
01:09:00.922 --> 01:09:04.455
- So dad. the doctor's advise surgery.

1104
01:09:04.456 --> 01:09:05.388
You're already on the donor's list.

1105
01:09:05.389 --> 01:09:08.056
We're just waiting on the liver.

1106
01:09:10.742 --> 01:09:13.183
- Well. I got myself here.

1107
01:09:13.184 --> 01:09:15.767
I don't want you to waste
your time and money on me.

1108
01:09:15.768 --> 01:09:16.661
- [Arthur] Come on. Dad.

1109
01:09:16.662 --> 01:09:19.744
You know I'm gonna do
whatever is necessary.

1110
01:09:19.745 --> 01:09:22.412
- How are we gonna pay for all this?

1111
01:09:25.971 --> 01:09:27.388
- There are ways.

1112
01:09:28.678 --> 01:09:31.197
Financing. installment plans.

1113
01:09:31.198 --> 01:09:34.647
- No. I'm not gonna leave
you with a shit pile of debt.

1114
01:09:34.648 --> 01:09:36.398
Juts to live a little bit longer.

1115
01:09:39.155 --> 01:09:43.674
- So Dad. your old manager
Stephan Greenfield.

1116
01:09:43.675 --> 01:09:45.659
he gave me a record deal.

1117
01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:48.540
- Stay away from Stephan Greenfield.

1118
01:09:48.541 --> 01:09:50.541
- Calm down. Calm down.

1119
01:09:51.515 --> 01:09:52.900
- Just a single. that's it.

1120
01:09:52.901 --> 01:09:55.674
- Don't waste your life on music.

1121
01:09:55.675 --> 01:09:58.508
Just walk away. Do something else.

1122
01:10:01.861 --> 01:10:02.693
- Do something else?

1123
01:10:02.694 --> 01:10:03.527
- Yeah.

1124
01:10:09.443 --> 01:10:11.780
- I don't know how to
do anything else. Dad.

1125
01:10:11.781 --> 01:10:14.700
- I've been down this road before.

1126
01:10:14.701 --> 01:10:18.647
It always ends up in the same
place. a big pile of shit.

1127
01:10:18.648 --> 01:10:20.565
Do something else. Art.

1128
01:10:23.461 --> 01:10:25.628
(beeping)

1129
01:10:32.075 --> 01:10:34.629
- You know. not everybody rides

1130
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:37.860
to reach the end of the road. Dad.

1131
01:10:37.861 --> 01:10:40.778
Some people just enjoy the journey.

1132
01:10:41.981 --> 01:10:44.140
If I don't follow my heart right now

1133
01:10:44.141 --> 01:10:45.207
what would I have to loop back on

1134
01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:48.125
and cherish when I'm 100 years old?

1135
01:10:49.795 --> 01:10:51.992
- If your music is gonna pay for this

1136
01:10:51.993 --> 01:10:54.207
them I am not gonna have the surgery.

1137
01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:55.041
- Dad.

1138
01:10:56.088 --> 01:10:57.921
- It's my choice. Art.

1139
01:10:58.807 --> 01:11:00.807
I hope you can respect that.

1140
01:11:01.781 --> 01:11:02.614
- But.

1141
01:11:07.981 --> 01:11:11.511
You know what? Congratulations. Dad.

1142
01:11:11.512 --> 01:11:12.679
You win again.

1143
01:11:28.131 --> 01:11:30.381
(rumpling)

1144
01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:47.667
(breathing heavy)

1145
01:11:50.128 --> 01:11:52.878
(doorbell rings)

1146
01:11:57.795 --> 01:11:59.592
- Mr. Greenfield?

1147
01:11:59.593 --> 01:12:00.426
- Hey.

1148
01:12:01.821 --> 01:12:03.404
Look what I got ya.

1149
01:12:04.328 --> 01:12:06.411
- Thanks for the whiskey.

1150
01:12:07.398 --> 01:12:10.754
Never know when you're gonna
need booze in this house.

1151
01:12:10.755 --> 01:12:12.588
So what brings you by?

1152
01:12:15.755 --> 01:12:18.940
- Well. I came to ask you
when we're doing the next one.

1153
01:12:18.941 --> 01:12:20.137
- I'm ready whenever you are.

1154
01:12:20.138 --> 01:12:21.287
My songs are ready to go.

1155
01:12:21.288 --> 01:12:23.714
- Here's the thing with that. Arthur.

1156
01:12:23.715 --> 01:12:27.382
The company thinks we
should do what we did.

1157
01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:29.459
- Again.

1158
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:30.980
- [Stephan] Again.

1159
01:12:30.981 --> 01:12:31.814
- No.

1160
01:12:32.834 --> 01:12:33.980
No. I'm sorry. Mr. Greenfield.

1161
01:12:33.981 --> 01:12:35.727
but I'm done with that.

1162
01:12:35.728 --> 01:12:36.714
I'm done.

1163
01:12:36.715 --> 01:12:41.433
- The company's willing
to negotiate a new deal.

1164
01:12:41.434 --> 01:12:44.554
willing to increase benefits.

1165
01:12:44.555 --> 01:12:45.579
Just think of Harold.

1166
01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:46.514
- You see. don't do that.

1167
01:12:46.515 --> 01:12:49.420
Stop playing the father
card cause he woke up.

1168
01:12:49.421 --> 01:12:51.514
He's refusing the surgery.

1169
01:12:51.515 --> 01:12:52.515
- Seriously?

1170
01:12:53.968 --> 01:12:55.968
And you're fine with it.

1171
01:12:56.968 --> 01:13:00.444
- It's not my call to make Mr. Greenfield.

1172
01:13:00.445 --> 01:13:02.564
- He's sick for Christ's sake.

1173
01:13:02.565 --> 01:13:07.300
- I'm sorry. but the next time
that you and I work together

1174
01:13:07.301 --> 01:13:09.714
it's gonna be on my songs.

1175
01:13:09.715 --> 01:13:12.260
It's gonna be with my voice.

1176
01:13:12.261 --> 01:13:14.511
But thanks for the whiskey.

1177
01:13:16.181 --> 01:13:18.264
(laughs)

1178
01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:22.427
- You think you can walk away from it?

1179
01:13:24.835 --> 01:13:27.418
(upbeat music)

1180
01:13:35.308 --> 01:13:36.641
- You all right?

1181
01:13:37.561 --> 01:13:38.393
- Yeah.

1182
01:13:38.394 --> 01:13:39.226
- Sure?

1183
01:13:39.227 --> 01:13:40.644
- Yes. I'm great.

1184
01:13:41.813 --> 01:13:43.984
- Hey. can I get you guys something?

1185
01:13:43.985 --> 01:13:45.360
- Yeah.

1186
01:13:45.361 --> 01:13:46.360
- [Caroline] Arthur.

1187
01:13:46.361 --> 01:13:47.279
- Caroline.

1188
01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.547
(laughing)

1189
01:13:48.548 --> 01:13:50.733
- Hey. hey. how are you guys?

1190
01:13:50.734 --> 01:13:51.587
- Lavanya.

1191
01:13:51.588 --> 01:13:52.420
- Yes. right.

1192
01:13:52.421 --> 01:13:54.002
- Yes. thanks.

1193
01:13:54.003 --> 01:13:55.211
- Congrats on the song. man.

1194
01:13:55.212 --> 01:13:56.053
- Thank you.

1195
01:13:56.054 --> 01:13:58.747
- You sound so damn
different than you used to.

1196
01:13:58.748 --> 01:14:02.959
- Yeah. that's funny
how that happens. right?

1197
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.640
- Look who we have here today. people.

1198
01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:07.985
Arthur Holzenberg. huh?

1199
01:14:07.986 --> 01:14:09.293
(clapping)

1200
01:14:09.294 --> 01:14:10.707
(laughing)

1201
01:14:10.708 --> 01:14:12.800
Come on. sing a song for us.

1202
01:14:12.801 --> 01:14:13.827
- Maybe another time. okay?

1203
01:14:13.828 --> 01:14:14.660
- [Caroline] Come on.

1204
01:14:14.661 --> 01:14:15.640

1205
01:14:15.641 --> 01:14:17.760

(breathing heavy)

1221
01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:05.439
- Let's get a drink of water or something.

1222
01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.273
(breathing heavy)

1223
01:15:36.783 --> 01:15:38.919
(mellow music)

1224
01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.587
(water running)

1225
01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:09.111
(dramatic music)

1226
01:17:06.643 --> 01:17:09.722
- If you think I enjoy coming down here.

1227
01:17:09.723 --> 01:17:12.188
you got another thing coming.

1228
01:17:12.189 --> 01:17:13.456

How you doing. buddy?

01:17:21.257 --> 01:17:23.696
They found you a liver.

1233
01:17:23.697 --> 01:17:26.697
All you gotta do is sign right here.

1234
01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:34.760
- All you gotta do is understand
what the fuck no means.

1235
01:17:35.293 --> 01:17:38.946
- Harold. people just trying to help you.

1236

01:17:50.912 --> 01:17:52.971
Well. think about it.

1243
01:17:58.152 --> 01:17:59.569
- Piss off. Adam.

1244
01:18:00.952 --> 01:18:02.952
Get the fuck outta here.

Arthur!

1249
01:18:24.246 --> 01:18:26.338

01:18:26.339 --> 01:18:27.171
- All right. all right!

1251
01:18:27.172 --> 01:18:28.379
- [Adam] Arthur!

1252
01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:29.523
Open the door.

1253
01:18:29.524 --> 01:18:31.029
- Coming.

1254
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.863
Jesus.

1255
01:18:33.937 --> 01:18:35.881
- Come on. what are

1256
01:18:35.882 --> 01:18:37.549

1258
01:18:40.417 --> 01:18:41.309

1259
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:44.562
- Come on. man. I'm celebrating.

1260
01:18:44.563 --> 01:18:45.443
I'm enjoying my life.

1261
01:18:45.444 --> 01:18:47.536
This is time to be celebrating. isn't it?

1262
01:18:47.537 --> 01:18:48.370
- Yeah.

1263
01:18:49.404 --> 01:18:51.213
You've clearly gone crazy.

1264
01:18:51.214 --> 01:18:52.381
- Yes. I have!

1265
01:18:53.964 --> 01:18:56.214
Y'all play out lately? Huh?

1266
01:18:58.097 --> 01:18:59.347
What about you?

1267
01:19:00.190 --> 01:19:04.349
Ringo Starr over here. Keeping it tight?

1268
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:05.856
What about you?

1269
01:19:05.857 --> 01:19:10.309
See. see. you can all
perform whenever you want.

1270
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:12.668
I can't do that anymore.

1271
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:13.789
Now. I have to be worried

1272
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:18.623
about people finding out what
my actual voice sounds like.

1273
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:24.360
You know I did all this for
my father in the first place.

1274
01:19:24.361 --> 01:19:27.321
You know what he said to me?

1275
01:19:27.322 --> 01:19:29.109
If your music's what's gonna pay for this

1276
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:31.610
then I don't want the surgery.

1277
01:19:33.084 --> 01:19:36.917
That's was before I
could tell him the truth.

1278
01:19:39.337 --> 01:19:40.441
I couldn't tell him.

1279
01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:41.274
- Why not?

1280
01:19:41.275 --> 01:19:43.216
- Because how do you follow that. La?

1281
01:19:43.217 --> 01:19:46.295
Hey dad. I stole your work

1282
01:19:46.296 --> 01:19:49.213
and sold it to the world as my own.

1283
01:19:51.764 --> 01:19:54.136
It's actually pretty funny.

1284
01:19:54.137 --> 01:19:57.163
I mean he never wanted me
to sing in the first place.

1285
01:19:57.164 --> 01:19:59.216
and here I am unable to sing.

1286
01:19:59.217 --> 01:20:02.029
So let's celebrate that. huh?

1287
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.863
- Arthur.

1288
01:20:03.844 --> 01:20:08.361
What we did. we did for Harry.

1289
01:20:09.268 --> 01:20:12.927
And that sacrifice ain’t for nothing.

1290
01:20:12.928 --> 01:20:15.595
FYI. they found him a new liver.

1291
01:20:16.671 --> 01:20:19.588
but he's still refusing to consent.

1292
01:20:21.499 --> 01:20:22.832
- Hey. look man.

1293
01:20:25.538 --> 01:20:27.978
I didn't know I'd give
a damn about any of this

1294
01:20:27.979 --> 01:20:30.524
when I first saw you in that bar.

1295
01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:32.324
You're a good dude.

1296
01:20:32.325 --> 01:20:35.492
But if you give up on your own family.

1297
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:41.257
you'll have nothing left to live for.

1298
01:20:43.043 --> 01:20:43.876
- Hey.

1299
01:20:44.912 --> 01:20:47.293
We're not going to give up on you.

1300
01:20:47.294 --> 01:20:50.977
So you can't give up on your father.

1301
01:20:50.978 --> 01:20:51.811
Okay?

1302
01:21:02.872 --> 01:21:05.289
(door slams)

1303
01:21:06.285 --> 01:21:07.431
Hi. sir.

1304
01:21:07.432 --> 01:21:08.432
I'm Lavanya.

1305
01:21:11.339 --> 01:21:12.496
- Hello. sir.

1306
01:21:12.497 --> 01:21:13.330
Will Goff.

1307
01:21:14.792 --> 01:21:15.625
Big fan.

1308
01:21:18.991 --> 01:21:19.823
- What is all this?

1309
01:21:19.824 --> 01:21:21.824
- This is my band. Dad.

1310
01:21:24.845 --> 01:21:26.031
- Maybe I should step out.

1311
01:21:26.032 --> 01:21:26.864
- No.

1312
01:21:26.865 --> 01:21:28.204
- No. no. maybe I should step out.

1313
01:21:28.205 --> 01:21:30.258
- No. no. everyone in this room

1314
01:21:30.259 --> 01:21:33.926
has a reason for being
in this room. right?

1315
01:21:36.337 --> 01:21:38.110
I need to understand your
thought process here. Dad.

1316
01:21:38.111 --> 01:21:40.111
because clearly I don't.

1317
01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.444
And I don't think this
decision that you're making

1318
01:21:45.445 --> 01:21:47.804
is in anyone's best interest.

1319
01:21:47.805 --> 01:21:49.591
I don't understand why
it's so hard for you

1320
01:21:49.592 --> 01:21:52.538
to sign the consent forms
now that we have the money.

1321
01:21:52.539 --> 01:21:55.231
and we have the liver.

1322
01:21:55.232 --> 01:21:58.748
You need to have the surgery.
Dad. or you're gonna die.

1323
01:21:58.749 --> 01:21:59.582
And...

1324
01:22:02.552 --> 01:22:07.469
The only person from stopping
you from getting this is you.

1325
01:22:08.579 --> 01:22:09.951
- Can I speak now?

1326
01:22:09.952 --> 01:22:14.884
- After everyone in this room
says what they came to say.

1327
01:22:14.885 --> 01:22:15.718
La?

1328
01:22:17.339 --> 01:22:20.085
- Sir. I've known Arthur
for a long time now.

1329
01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.527
And I've got a father too.

1330
01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:28.471
- It's all right. go on.

1331
01:22:28.472 --> 01:22:29.815
- No child would wanna see their father

1332
01:22:29.816 --> 01:22:32.399
go through something like this.

1333
01:22:34.377 --> 01:22:35.209
- Will.

1334
01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:36.042
- Hm?

1335
01:22:36.043 --> 01:22:36.895
Do you want me to?

1336
01:22:36.896 --> 01:22:37.729
- Yeah.

1337
01:22:39.311 --> 01:22:40.144
Go head.

1338
01:22:43.352 --> 01:22:45.444
- Arthur is a good man.

1339
01:22:45.445 --> 01:22:48.695
And I think you should consider surgery

1340
01:22:50.713 --> 01:22:55.309
because whatever he had
done. he's done for you.

1341
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:59.789
- If you don't sign the
consent form today. Harold.

1342
01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:02.232
they gonna take you off the list.

1343
01:23:02.233 --> 01:23:06.426
and at that point. there's
nothing anybody can do.

1344
01:23:06.427 --> 01:23:07.986
- Can I talk now?

1345
01:23:07.987 --> 01:23:08.820
- Please.

1346
01:23:15.853 --> 01:23:16.770
- Arthur...

1347
01:23:19.587 --> 01:23:24.587
Your mother didn't leave
me. I mean. just leave me.

1348
01:23:24.711 --> 01:23:27.044
She left me for another man.

1349
01:23:29.767 --> 01:23:33.017
I was on the top of this damn business.

1350
01:23:34.045 --> 01:23:36.962
I was so busy. I couldn't be a dad.

1351
01:23:38.793 --> 01:23:40.793
I couldn't be a husband.

1352
01:23:42.204 --> 01:23:44.272
And I was so busy I
didn't even see the signs

1353
01:23:44.273 --> 01:23:47.773
where she's going off with some other man.

1354
01:23:50.758 --> 01:23:53.008
And I couldn't accept that.

1355
01:23:55.657 --> 01:23:56.574
I couldn't.

1356
01:23:58.190 --> 01:23:59.607
And then I drank.

1357
01:24:00.563 --> 01:24:02.646
And I drank. and I drank.

1358
01:24:05.872 --> 01:24:07.955
And then I couldn't play.

1359
01:24:09.963 --> 01:24:13.213
I lost my music because I lost my love.

1360
01:24:14.867 --> 01:24:17.784
I lost my love because of my music.

1361
01:24:19.094 --> 01:24:21.389
(uplifting music)

1362
01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:24.256
What good is all this
fame and money doing ya

1363
01:24:24.257 --> 01:24:27.257
when you don't even got your family.

1364
01:24:29.094 --> 01:24:30.011
You see me?

1365
01:24:32.043 --> 01:24:34.002
I don't have any reason for hanging around

1366
01:24:34.003 --> 01:24:37.836
to see him go down the
same shitty road. Adam.

1367
01:24:38.897 --> 01:24:39.730
- For me?

1368
01:24:41.203 --> 01:24:43.286
Just fucking die already.

1369
01:24:50.424 --> 01:24:52.257
- He ain’t you. Harold.

1370
01:24:54.258 --> 01:24:55.258
He's better.

1371
01:24:57.071 --> 01:25:01.550
He gambled what he wanted
to be for your sake.

1372
01:25:01.551 --> 01:25:02.551
and he lost.

1373
01:25:04.618 --> 01:25:07.577
They didn't just ask
him to sing your song.

1374
01:25:07.578 --> 01:25:09.745
They asked him to mime it.

1375
01:25:10.765 --> 01:25:12.550
And now he's running around scared

1376
01:25:12.551 --> 01:25:15.218
that everybody's gonna find out.

1377
01:25:16.176 --> 01:25:19.124
And if you leave him in this state

1378
01:25:19.125 --> 01:25:22.458
then you ain't no better than your wife.

1379
01:25:26.589 --> 01:25:29.185
So get yourself together. man.

1380
01:25:29.186 --> 01:25:32.519
Do the right thing but not for yourself.

1381
01:25:33.816 --> 01:25:34.899
for your son.

1382
01:25:36.493 --> 01:25:37.743
He deserves it.

1383
01:25:56.263 --> 01:25:59.967
- Hey. you mind if I play some music?

1384
01:25:59.968 --> 01:26:01.051
- Yeah. sure.

1385
01:26:05.674 --> 01:26:08.257
(upbeat music)

1386
01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:16.809
- You seems like this one.

1387
01:26:16.810 --> 01:26:17.876
- Oh yeah. yeah.

1388
01:26:17.877 --> 01:26:20.960
I'd say it's an old one from the 90s.

1389
01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:24.817
That was famous back then.

1390
01:26:28.410 --> 01:26:31.156
- I knew the guy who sang it.

1391
01:26:31.157 --> 01:26:31.990
- Really?

1392
01:26:33.237 --> 01:26:34.237
What was it?

1393
01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:38.370
Hollenburg. or Holkenborg?

1394
01:26:39.570 --> 01:26:43.306
Had a couple of hits back in the day.

1395
01:26:43.307 --> 01:26:46.608
Don't know what ever
happened to him after that.

1396
01:26:46.609 --> 01:26:47.942
He disappeared.

1397
01:26:49.263 --> 01:26:51.680
- So who's your favorite now?

1398
01:26:53.610 --> 01:26:56.916
- I don't have any in this decade.

1399
01:26:56.917 --> 01:26:58.917
- Really? May I ask why?

1400
01:27:01.507 --> 01:27:06.142
- Artists back in those
days. had a story to tell.

1401
01:27:06.143 --> 01:27:08.169
an actual art. (laughs)

1402
01:27:08.170 --> 01:27:11.662
And they had to actually be good.

1403
01:27:11.663 --> 01:27:14.663
Not like these hashtag artists in LA

1404
01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:19.353
with their reboots. and their remakes.

1405
01:27:19.354 --> 01:27:21.130
I don't know

1406
01:27:22.596 --> 01:27:25.663
They plug the aux into their iPhones

1407
01:27:27.383 --> 01:27:29.209
Play a song.

1408
01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.627
That they sang for the 100th time.

1409
01:27:33.149 --> 01:27:35.329
and then ask my honest opinion.

1410
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:39.527
(laughs)

1411
01:27:39.528 --> 01:27:44.147
As if they're gonna get
a record deal from me.

1412
01:27:44.148 --> 01:27:47.156
Yeah.

1413
01:27:47.157 --> 01:27:49.407
- Had a story to tell. huh?

1414
01:27:53.063 --> 01:27:55.102
Hey. you know what? Can
you let me out right here?

1415
01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:56.169
- Right here? Are you sure?

1416
01:27:56.170 --> 01:27:58.420
- Yeah. yeah. this is good.

1417
01:28:04.903 --> 01:28:05.736
Thanks.

1418
01:28:20.703 --> 01:28:21.870
Hey. everyone.

1419
01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:25.167
Arthur Holzenberg here.

1420
01:28:26.527 --> 01:28:31.511
and I have a confession that
I wanna get off my chest.

1421
01:28:35.217 --> 01:28:38.378
So. many of you know.
we just had some success

1422
01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:40.629
with the album Nightingale.

1423
01:28:42.219 --> 01:28:43.052
but...

1424
01:28:45.952 --> 01:28:48.911
I didn't write Nightingale.

1425
01:28:48.912 --> 01:28:51.086
It's not even me singing.

1426
01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:54.194
It's my dad.

1427
01:28:55.486 --> 01:28:56.736
It's his songs.

1428
01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:58.949
It's his voice.

1429
01:29:00.524 --> 01:29:03.774
I did it to pay for his medical bills.

1430
01:29:06.473 --> 01:29:07.306
But...

1431
01:29:11.125 --> 01:29:12.289
no excuses.

1432
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:15.540
At the time it seemed like a good idea.

1433
01:29:19.727 --> 01:29:21.394
- Okay. hello? Yeah.

1434
01:29:23.424 --> 01:29:26.777
I don't know. why'd he do that?

1435
01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:29.566
I... (exhales)

1436
01:29:29.567 --> 01:29:30.417
Well. I don't know.

1437
01:29:30.418 --> 01:29:32.168
I wasn't there. Okay?

1438
01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.779
- This is my decision.

1439
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:40.447
and I have to live with
the consequences. so

1440
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.667
I just thought it was
time to tell my story.

1441
01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:52.130
Thanks for listening.

1442
01:30:05.593 --> 01:30:07.760
(exhales)

1443
01:30:55.356 --> 01:30:58.106
- So what made you do it. Arthur?

1444
01:31:02.556 --> 01:31:04.806
(laughing)

1445
01:31:10.463 --> 01:31:11.296
Oh. well.

1446
01:31:15.062 --> 01:31:17.145
(laughs)

1447
01:31:26.123 --> 01:31:26.955
- No. no. no. no. no.

1448
01:31:26.956 --> 01:31:29.429
Don't mess up your stitches.

1449
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:31.551
How you feeling?

1450
01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:33.219
- Never felt better.

1451
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:36.873
