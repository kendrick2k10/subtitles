1
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.880
66 million years ago.

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.120
Planet Earth was very different
from today.

3
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.040
Back then. one of our closest
ancestors might have looked

4
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.480
something like
this little furry creature.

5
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.400
RUMBLING GROWL

6
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.600
The rulers of the land
were giant reptiles.

7
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.720
Dinosaurs.

8
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.360
That's one of the most infamous.

9
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.240
a carnivorous T-rex.

10
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.200
And just behind are
the bison of their time.

11
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.960
a common plant-eater.
Edmontosaurus.

12
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.880
But what happened to them all?

13
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.680
66 million years ago.

14
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.000
an asteroid hit the Earth.

15
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.200
and scientists think
that it was this collision

16
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.320
that wiped out the dinosaurs.

17
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.880
But no-one has ever found
direct evidence of that.

18
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.200
In fact. no-one has ever found
the fossil of a dinosaur

19
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.240
that died within
a thousand years of the impact.

20
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.000
However. a remarkable dig site
promises to change that.

21
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.600
It's in the Hell Creek formation

22
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.000
in the American Midwest.

23
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.840
These badlands are rich
in prehistoric remains...

24
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.400
ROARS

25
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.400
..from triceratops...

26
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.320
SQUAWKS

27
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.320
..to pterosaurs.

28
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.160
And here. one patch of land

29
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.600
about the size of a football pitch

30
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.680
is yielding a collection
of astonishing fossils.

31
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.280
The precise location is
a closely guarded secret.

32
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.480
because this place
may hold evidence...

33
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.120
..of one of the most dramatic events

34
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.200
in all the four-and-a-half-
billion-year history

35
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.600
of our planet.

36
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.040
Right. let me get down here
between you.

37
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.640
For ten years.
a palaeontologist and his team

38
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.800
have been trying to find out
exactly what happened here.

39
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.280
You're at the edge
of your seat every moment.

40
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.880
trying to dig this stuff up.

41
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.840
It's like trying to defuse
a nuclear weapon

42
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.000
while you're in a rainstorm.

43
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.360
He's named the site Tanis.

44
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.800
and believes it could be
a mass graveyard

45
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.320
of creatures that were killed

46
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.000
in the catastrophic asteroid strike.

47
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.160
A site that could reveal not only
how the last dinosaurs lived.

48
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.720
but how they died.

49
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.400
If the dig team is right.
Tanis could be a place

50
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.560
where the remains
of a long-lost world

51
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.480
are frozen in time.

52
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.200
A place that gives us.
for the first time.

53
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.520
an unprecedented window...

54
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.720
SHRIEKS

55
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.000
..into the lives
of the very last dinosaurs...

56
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.200
..and a minute-by-minute
picture of what happened

57
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.880
on the day the asteroid hit.

58
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.960
This landscape is full of fossils

59
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.320
dating from the Late Cretaceous.

60
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.720
the period which began
around 100 million years ago

61
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.320
and ended 66 million years ago.

62
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.120
when the dinosaurs vanished.

63
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.280
Palaeontologist Robert DePalma
wants to find out more.

64
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.680
I think anybody
who's ever liked dinosaurs

65
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.600
in the past. or still does.

66
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.360
has thought at one point
or another.

67
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.680
"Well. what happened to them?

68
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.400
"Why are they not here
any more?"

69
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.240
So many different theories
are out there.

70
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.840
and nobody has a tight answer
to that question.

71
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.200
Judging from fossil evidence.

72
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.000
this is what Hell Creek looked
like in the Late Cretaceous.

73
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.520
There were low-lying.
marshy flood plains.

74
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.520
intercut by river channels
and covered with horsetails.

75
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.920
ferns and trees.

76
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.280
Back then. it was warm
and wet here all year round.

77
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.720
Tanis lies
in the north-eastern corner

78
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.160
of the Hell Creek formation.

79
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.360
Instead of today's
dusty prairies.

80
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.120
there were sandy river banks.

81
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.640
Instead of rocky cliffs.
there were forests.

82
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.840
And instead
of the life we know today...

83
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.960
DEEP RUMBLING CALLS

84
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.600
TRILLING

85
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.200
..well. Robert is hoping
to find out more

86
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.920
about what that was like.

87
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.640
COOING

88
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.680
A sandbank lying between
a river and a forest

89
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.360
would one day become
what Robert now calls Tanis.

90
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.840
He and his team have been
digging here since 2012.

91
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.360
So somewhere from between there

92
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.040
and down here
is where that came from.

93
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.800
It's come from up above.
Hey. look at this.

94
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.200
What?  Look.

95
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.720
Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah. OK.

96
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.240
And what they found is unexpected.

97
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.280
Here we've got
this freshwater environment

98
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.600
of the Hell Creek formation.

99
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.520
and these shocking
red. green colours

100
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.200
coming from the shells of ammonites.
a marine organism.

101
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.800
kind of like a coiled snail
in appearance.

102
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.480
So we've got this marine organism
that's been thrown up

103
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.000
into this freshwater environment.

104
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.920
and they do not belong here.

105
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.440
How they got here is a mystery.

106
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.480
OK...

107
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.600
And there's more.

108
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.120
I'm just going to go ahead and
plane down some of this rock.

109
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.320
Sitting just above the ammonites

110
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.040
is something that
many dinosaur hunters

111
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.080
are desperate to find.

112
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.120
So this orange layer right here
is composed 100%

113
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.280
of impact-related debris
that is enriched in iridium.

114
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.080
Iridium is an element that's rare
in the Earth's crust.

115
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.200
but it's common in asteroids.

116
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.800
The layer it's in is called
the K-Pg boundary.

117
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.200
Dear Momma...

118
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.640
Oh. dear. Really?
Yeah.

119
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.200
It's made up of dust and debris
from a huge asteroid impact.

120
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.800
Look at that.  That's amazing.

121
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.880
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.
That's what we want.

122
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.560
OK. So it's coming
from this area here.

123
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.480
So somewhere within that region is
where these pieces are coming from.

124
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.320
The boundary separates
the age of the dinosaurs

125
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.280
from the age of mammals.

126
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.120
so the rocks here
come from about the time

127
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.560
that the dinosaurs became extinct.

128
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.520
No rattlesnakes.

129
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.360
What makes the site even
more exciting

130
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.360
is the rock layer
right beneath the boundary

131
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.160
where Robert found the ammonites.

132
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.840
The rock here
is really not quite rocky.

133
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.480
as you would expect dinosaur bones
and things to be encased -

134
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.000
you expect really. really hard
rocks and jackhammers

135
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.640
and things like this.
but it's very. very crumbly

136
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.280
and it just falls apart
in your hands.

137
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.760
As well as being crumbly
throughout.

138
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.480
this layer of rock is also
around a metre thick.

139
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.760
which. along with
other unusual features. makes

140
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.880
Robert think that something very
strange must have happened here.

141
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.400
Maybe a flood or a mud flow.

142
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.880
burying anything within it
in an instant.

143
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.160
Oh. there's a beautiful...
Look at that one - beautiful.

144
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.240
This could mean that anything
he finds in this layer

145
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.960
would have been quickly entombed.

146
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.000
like the bodies in
the volcanic ash of Pompeii.

147
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.840
Robert knows from the geology

148
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.400
that anything he finds at Tanis
will be tantalisingly close

149
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.640
to the end
of the age of the dinosaurs

150
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.880
and could be so well preserved

151
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.880
that it could reveal new evidence

152
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.800
that will bring this time period
to life

153
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.160
in a way
no-one has ever done before.

154
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.800
Robert digs at Tanis each summer.

155
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.880
the only time the weather
allows him to do so.

156
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.400
Come on down.
check out this lens over here.

157
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.240
In order to understand how the
impact affected life on Earth.

158
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.240
you really need to get
a very clear picture

159
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.800
of what the world was like
right before.

160
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.440
That is a critical part
of the story.

161
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.680
Palaeontologists Dr David Burnham

162
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.200
and Loren Gurche have been
digging with Robert for years.

163
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.240
Oh. wow!

164
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.400
See...see the brown?  Yep.

165
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.000
That might be a tubercle
right there.

166
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.480
And it seems today is their
lucky day.

167
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.320
Oh. my God! Look at that!
Look at that.

168
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.760
Look. the scales are preserved!

169
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.240
Holy crap! Like doing
a freaking dissection.

170
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.400
Oh. my God.  Biology of Tanis.

171
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.720
Oh. the scale...

172
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.480
Look. look - the wrinkles
continue down that way.

173
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.280
Mine's all nice and wet so far.

174
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.600
The scales are getting smaller
in that direction.

175
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.680
How big are they there?

176
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.400
I got a...I got one with
the projection over here.

177
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.640
What?  Oh!

178
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.760
Yeah.  Oh.

179
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.640
Yeah. there's the protuberance
right there.

180
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.840
I've only seen that on one other
specimen. in life.  Yep.

181
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.760
This is the closest thing
to getting to touch

182
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.160
a living. breathing dinosaur.

183
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.600
It is.

184
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.040
They found something extraordinary.

185
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.720
It is so exceedingly rare -

186
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.360
a piece of triceratops skin
in the Hell Creek formation.

187
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.480
It may look like
an impression in the rock.

188
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.760
but this is skin
that has been fossilised

189
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.240
and. over millions of years.
has turned to stone.

190
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.920
Triceratops bones are relatively
common finds in Hell Creek.

191
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.840
but skin in such condition as this
is very rare indeed.

192
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.560
The size and the patterning
of the scales.

193
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.160
together with the age
and location of the rocks

194
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.640
where it was found.
strongly suggests

195
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.760
that this is
from a triceratops.

196
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.080
The brown colour contains
traces of organic material.

197
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.080
So it might even be possible
from this

198
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.960
to work out
which pigments were in it.

199
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.120
Finding and studying

200
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.520
such well-preserved fossils
as this

201
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.440
helps palaeontologists build

202
00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.280
a much more detailed picture
of how these creatures lived.

203
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.040
Combining this information

204
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.960
with insights from scientists
around the world

205
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.000
makes it possible to speculate

206
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.080
about what life
in the Late Cretaceous

207
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.080
might have been like.

208
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.960
We know from bones

209
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.720
that adult triceratops could
reach nine metres in length

210
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.640
and three metres in height.

211
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.120
RUMBLING

212
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.080
Marks on the fossil also show us

213
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.680
that this one was badly scarred.

214
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.080
RUMBLING GROWL

215
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.560
Triceratops were plant-eaters.

216
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.680
Other fossils tell us
that they had sharp beaks

217
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.680
and hundreds of teeth that enabled
them to shred tough plants

218
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.560
such as these cycads.

219
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.400
DISTANT TRUMPETING

220
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.400
Almost all adult
triceratops fossils.

221
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.640
including Robert's.
have been found on their own.

222
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.200
So it's possible
that the adults were solitary.

223
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.760
like modern-day male rhinos.

224
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.160
So they were
probably territorial.

225
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.400
chasing rivals away.

226
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.280
And perhaps
marking their territories.

227
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.040
If you weigh more
than an African elephant.

228
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.120
there's not much
that can bother you...

229
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.720
SQUEAKING

230
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.800
..except perhaps a little mammal.

231
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.560
GROWLS

232
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.200
Robert found these jawbones

233
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.600
in the fossilised burrow at Tanis.

234
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.840
The shape of this tiny bone
and tooth

235
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.160
means it's most likely come
from what's known

236
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.240
as a pediomyid. an early mammal

237
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.240
and a type of marsupial.

238
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.960
Robert also discovered
fossilised nuts and seeds

239
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.240
in the burrow.

240
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.600
So we have an idea about
what it might have eaten.

241
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.240
DISTANT TRUMPETING

242
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.240
Robert's finds are adding

243
00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.720
to our knowledge
of the complex world

244
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.840
at the very end
of the Late Cretaceous.

245
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.280
And it's not just
the fossilised creatures.

246
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.920
If you walk on damp sand.

247
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.960
you'll leave a trace behind.

248
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.280
A footprint.

249
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.040
The same was true
66 million years ago.

250
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.520
And very. very occasionally.
such traces were preserved.

251
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.120
And that's exactly
what happened here at Tanis.

252
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.640
You know. we won't foil a backside.

253
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.720
Right. we'll just put...
Put plaster right on.

254
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.880
That way you've got...

255
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.400
Robert has discovered
a number of footprints.

256
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.320
Yeah. Let's see.

257
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.640
Looks like a good print.  Yeah.

258
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.680
Their shape gives him a clue

259
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.280
as to what might have made them.

260
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.600
If he's right.

261
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.040
they were made by a winged creature.

262
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.080
that might well have liked
a small mammal...

263
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.080
..for lunch.

264
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.640
The footprints are long and narrow

265
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.200
with four toe prints.

266
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.800
Two are slightly longer
than the others.

267
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.760
and that suggests
they were made by...

268
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.800
..a pterosaur.

269
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.320
SQUAWKS

270
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.200
Pterosaurs are not dinosaurs.
but flying reptiles

271
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.240
on a different branch
of the evolutionary tree.

272
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.160
SCREECHING

273
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.200
Male pterosaurs
usually had crests.

274
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.000
while females didn't.

275
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.600
So crests may have been
used in courtship displays.

276
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.360
SHRIEKS

277
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.200
And we have an indication of
where females laid their eggs.

278
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.120
because evidence suggests
one pterosaur laid hers

279
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.840
in the soft. sandy banks
of the river at Tanis.

280
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.040
And this is a fossilised egg

281
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.960
of a pterosaur
that Robert found there.

282
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.760
The only one ever discovered
in North America.

283
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.160
If you look at it
with the naked eye.

284
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.200
all you see
is a jumble of lines.

285
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.200
But if you examine it
with the latest technology.

286
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.280
you can find out
a wealth of information.

287
00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.480
from the chemistry of the bones

288
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.480
to the composition of the shell.

289
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.360
And that. in turn.
can tell us a lot about

290
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.200
how these incredible creatures
lived.

291
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.160
Robert has been given access

292
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.200
to the Diamond Light Source
synchrotron in Oxfordshire.

293
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.080
It's a very powerful research tool

294
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.160
that acts like a giant microscope.

295
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.960
By accelerating electrons
in this huge ring.

296
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.040
the synchrotron creates
beams of light

297
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.560
many times brighter than the sun.

298
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.440
Robert and paleobiologist
Dr Victoria Egerton

299
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.480
now want to turn that beam
onto the egg fossil

300
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.920
to discover more
about its chemical make-up.

301
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.560
We're pretty much lined up
on the skeleton.

302
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.440
but we might have to move
the stage a little bit

303
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.320
to get to the right part.  Sure.

304
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:22.400
Meanwhile. Robert can reveal
the creature inside.

305
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.520
And this?

306
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.760
Who made this wonderful thing?

307
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.080
I got replicas of the bones
from inside that egg

308
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.520
and I restored the remainder

309
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.560
and put together

310
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.920
what the skeleton would've
looked like when it hatched.

311
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.000
That's how big the creature
would've been

312
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.440
outside the egg. if it had hatched.

313
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.440
So this is the baby.
How big was it going to grow?

314
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.160
These very long neck vertebrae
here

315
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.320
are what really gave part
of the story away to us.

316
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.840
because those long bones
match very. very closely

317
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.480
with the azhdarchid pterosaurs.

318
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.160
That is the giant pterosaurs.

319
00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.280
Oh. they were the whoppers.
weren't they?

320
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.360
I mean. what. 25 feet?

321
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.880
Wingspan?  Some of them.

322
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.240
This probably had a wingspan.
maybe 15 feet. five metres.

323
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.000
Well. it looks as though
it could take off. really.

324
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
It's easy to picture
something like that

325
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.160
just hatching out of the egg
and fluttering out.

326
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.000
almost like a little bat.

327
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.360
They've scanned the egg.
here and in America.

328
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.640
Victoria has the results.

329
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.720
So what have you learned
from the synchrotron image?

330
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.120
What we have here is a chemical map

331
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.960
of calcium directly within
the bones of this animal.

332
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.080
That tells us that these bones
were already hardened.

333
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.880
So it might be ready to fly
not long after it hatches.

334
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.440
OK. Can you see any sign
of the shell.

335
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.840
and what sort of shell was it?

336
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.120
We can. What I can show you...

337
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.520
Ah!

338
00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.600
..is we can see the rim
of the egg in sulphur.

339
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.560
Does that tell you whether it was
a hard shell or a soft shell?

340
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.160
We have been looking at this.

341
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.360
We can see folding occurring.
and this unusual undulation.

342
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.160
If it were a hard egg.

343
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.080
we would expect splintered bits
and broken bits.

344
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.200
just like a chicken egg.

345
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.000
This helped to tell us
that it was soft.

346
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.200
So it was perhaps like a turtle?

347
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.520
Absolutely.

348
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.040
That's not the case. is it.
with dinosaurs?

349
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.120
Many dinosaurs laid
hard-shelled eggs.  Yes.

350
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.400
So this is a new discovery
about azhdarchid pterosaurs?

351
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.760
Absolutely. This is something

352
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.000
that we are confirming
for the first time.

353
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.360
Huh!

354
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.640
That flying pterosaurs
had eggs like turtles.

355
00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.720
Yes.

356
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.360
Much more reptilianlike
than birdlike.

357
00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.720
And that can potentially
tell us more

358
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.120
about the environment
in which these eggs were laid.

359
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.920
How interesting. Yeah.

360
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.160
Creatures that lay soft eggs
tend to bury them

361
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.800
in order to protect them.

362
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.440
SQUAWKS

363
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.040
So female pterosaurs
probably looked for

364
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.280
places like Tanis
to lay their eggs...

365
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.000
..because the sandy soil here
is just soft enough

366
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.200
for the hatchling to dig itself out.

367
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.960
SNIFFING

368
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.480
Now the pterosaur
just has to make sure

369
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.040
that the hole...

370
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.040
..is perfect.

371
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.880
SQUAWKS

372
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.320
WARBLING

373
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.200
Success!

374
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.080
But it's not over yet.

375
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.520
Pterosaurs had two ovaries.

376
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.240
and they laid their eggs in pairs.

377
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.040
Here on the sandbank.

378
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.240
sandwiched between the river
and these glorious trees.

379
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.240
life at Tanis
seemed to be thriving.

380
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.240
GASPS

381
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.240
Whoops!

382
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.160
Never a dull moment.

383
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.200
But all that was about to change.

384
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.840
The chain of events that led to the
extinction of the dinosaurs

385
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.960
began in the distant past.
deep in space.

386
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.520
Most scientists think it all started
in a ring of dust.

387
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.280
rocks. and debris
known as the asteroid belt.

388
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.000
It's usually an uneventful place.

389
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.080
But it's thought that many.
many millions of years ago.

390
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.240
a rock was bumped
into a new orbit...

391
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.720
..and diverted onto a collision
course with Planet Earth.

392
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.200
Robert is building a vivid picture

393
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.440
of Late Cretaceous life
at Tanis.

394
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.840
And the team have found some more
well-preserved footprints.

395
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.520
So these are animals that were
actually walking in the water?

396
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.560
These guys would've been
essentially on

397
00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.080
a mushy river bank going down

398
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.800
to drink at some point.

399
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.960
You know. animals tend to
congregate around the rivers.

400
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.680
This print is 30 centimetres long.

401
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.240
So I think this is from
a type of dinosaur

402
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.160
that we call a duck-billed dinosaur.

403
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.800
And they would've been
very common in the Cretaceous.

404
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.120
They ate the plants in the area

405
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.640
and they got very large -
30 feet long.

406
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.840
And there are more.

407
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.600
This track. you see all the toes
are very well preserved.

408
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.680
You even see a nail print
at the tips of the toes.

409
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.000
So the little toenails
dug into the mud.

410
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.240
I love this one.

411
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.120
This is Robert's prized footprint.

412
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.040
It has three toes.

413
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.560
and it's longer than it is wide.

414
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.160
So it's very likely to be
a carnivorous dinosaur.

415
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.680
It's so well preserved
that you can see

416
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.240
the mark left by
its sharp claw there.

417
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.040
Hell Creek is well known

418
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.960
for one carnivore in particular -
T-rex.

419
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.480
This footprint is too small
for an adult T-rex.

420
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.480
but it's possible that it was made
by a young one.

421
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.320
Robert also found this at Tanis -

422
00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.800
the crown of a tooth.

423
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.800
Its shape and its serrated edge

424
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.200
are indications that it comes

425
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.960
from an adult T-rex.

426
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.400
RUMBLING GROWL

427
00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:58.360
DEEP RUMBLING GROWL

428
00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.760
GROWLS

429
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.000
Bite marks found on T-rex bones

430
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
show that they ate other T-rexes.

431
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.320
And a youngster
would make an easy catch.

432
00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.360
SNEEZES

433
00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.680
But not this time.

434
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.320
Very few footprints
are preserved as fossils

435
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.200
in Hell Creek.

436
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.520
So if you find several
in one place.

437
00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.160
as Robert has done.

438
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.720
it's a reasonable assumption

439
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.120
that there would've been
many more nearby.

440
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.160
And that supports the idea

441
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.880
that dinosaurs and pterosaurs
were thriving at Tanis

442
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.960
shortly before the impact.

443
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.320
GROWLING

444
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.040
And if they were thriving...

445
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.360
SQUAWKING

446
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.440
..they must have been reproducing.

447
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.080
Fossils from dinosaurs
similar to T-rex

448
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.280
show they may have laid
around 20 eggs

449
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.280
in a circular nest.

450
00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.280
It's possible that. like crocodiles.

451
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.680
they partly covered their eggs
to keep them warm.

452
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.720
SNEEZES

453
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.360
For one T-rex. a misfortune.

454
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.080
But for all dinosaurs...

455
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.280
ROARS

456
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.320
..a disaster was looming.

457
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:30.720
Deep in space.
the asteroid was approaching.

458
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.440
Its journey would take it through
the orbit

459
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.240
of our neighbouring planet. Mars.

460
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.720
Had the two collided.

461
00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.800
a catastrophe on Earth
would've been avoided.

462
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.560
But it was not to be...

463
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.800
..and Earth's fate was sealed.

464
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.560
As Robert's dig continues.

465
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.640
his vision of what happened at Tanis

466
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.480
is finally starting to come
together.

467
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.320
It seems the sandbank was full
of life.

468
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.840
T-rex. triceratops.

469
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.080
little mammals.

470
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.000
alongside the footprints of
other dinosaurs and pterosaurs.

471
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.040
all in a very small area.

472
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.800
BLOWS

473
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.800
You see the scales?

474
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.840
I do. Oh. my God.

475
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.080
That excites me just looking at it!

476
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.560
Then Robert finds
something truly remarkable.

477
00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.600
See the cracks already forming?
Look at that.

478
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.520
So we're going to have to really
monitor that before we glue it.

479
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.880
Cos this is getting vulnerable
now.

480
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.320
An almost complete creature.

481
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.800
To get this block out.
we're freezing it.

482
00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.360
Robert is about to attempt
something tricky.

483
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.760
Steady... Let's go.

484
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.640
To get the fossil out
in one piece. they're trying

485
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.120
to freeze it using liquid nitrogen

486
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.280
at almost 200 degrees below zero.

487
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.440
Watch your footing.

488
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.880
Loren. I'm worried
about brittleness here.

489
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.200
Get that hammer. Give this a couple
whacks with the hammer.

490
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.800
OK. Move over five centimetres.
Good.

491
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.600
It's cracked loose. Yep.
OK. It's loose.

492
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.120
So we have to get this out
in one piece.

493
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.160
One. two. three.

494
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.480
Yeehaw!

495
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.640
Total success.  Total success.

496
00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.800
This is a technique
used in archaeology

497
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.240
for digging up human remains.

498
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.400
We've got enough time
to work with the fossil

499
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.120
and not damage it.

500
00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.600
And I couldn't be happier.

501
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.640
And the creature Robert found?

502
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.480
A turtle.

503
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.440
This is the fossil
now it's been cleaned up.

504
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.080
It's lying on its side.

505
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.960
Here's the outline of its shell.

506
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.000
The shape of the shell
and the scalloped edges here

507
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.720
tell us that this was
a baenid turtle.

508
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.520
Robert's baenid turtle
looks very similar

509
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.320
to modern cooter turtles

510
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.720
and lived in the same sort
of freshwater environment.

511
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.920
For a turtle.
Tanis would've been ideal.

512
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.520
Warm. shallow water.

513
00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.080
Plenty to eat.

514
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.800
And lots of safe places
in which to warm up

515
00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.960
in the Late Cretaceous sunshine.

516
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.320
The turtle fossil Robert found
is almost complete.

517
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.200
This is the underside.

518
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.280
and this brown material up here
is fossilised wood.

519
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.000
It's the end of a stick that passes
right through its body

520
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.200
and comes out just here.

521
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.000
So the evidence points towards

522
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.280
this turtle having been impaled.

523
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.120
A violent end to one of
the many creatures found

524
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.400
in the crumbly rock layer at Tanis.

525
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.080
When I look at the animals

526
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.720
and plants preserved
in the sediments of Tanis

527
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.440
and the footprints beneath it.

528
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.080
I see a picture of
a vibrant ecosystem.

529
00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.240
many different dinosaurs.
and a thriving. thriving place.

530
00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.480
After ten years of digging.

531
00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.600
there is now enough evidence
to piece together

532
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.440
much of the story of Tanis

533
00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.080
and the creatures which lived here.

534
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.200
Robert has found so many fossils.
it looks as if.

535
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.600
even at the very end
of the Late Cretaceous.

536
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.680
Tanis was bursting with life.

537
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.600
VARIOUS ANIMAL CALLS

538
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.440
Full of the giant reptiles
that had dominated the planet

539
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.520
for more than 150 million years.

540
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.440
BARKING

541
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.640
It's impossible to know
how much longer

542
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.280
their reign would've continued...

543
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.760
SQUAWKS

544
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.240
..because all this was about to end.

545
00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.400
The asteroid hit...

546
00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:51.280
..in what is now the Yucatan
peninsula in Mexico.

547
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.800
It's called the Chicxulub asteroid

548
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.720
after the town nearest
to the centre of its crater.

549
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.520
ROARING

550
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.760
ROARS

551
00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:22.160
Any living thing within 900 miles
of the impact...

552
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.120
..was destroyed by the blast.

553
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.840
But what effect
did the impact have on Tanis.

554
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.360
nearly 2.000 miles away?

555
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.640
To find out.

556
00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.720
Robert is looking for clues
that might link Tanis

557
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.920
to the actual day the asteroid hit.

558
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.480
BLOWS

559
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.320
We've got some wood.

560
00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.320
and pressed up against this
and all intertangled.

561
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.200
we've got the carcasses of fish.

562
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.520
OK.

563
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.720
That's a beautifully preserved
tail.

564
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.640
so that fish is going to be
absolutely gorgeous.

565
00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.200
So part of the detail work
that we're doing right now

566
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.840
is going in and checking out

567
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.600
all the individual elements
in this mass death layer.

568
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.840
Some of the evidence
he's found so far

569
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.400
has been hidden inside
the fish themselves.

570
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.640
In more ways than one. it literally
is an operation of a Cretaceous

571
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.640
fish. so we're performing surgery
on this thing.

572
00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.680
Robert needs to open this
fish's skull.

573
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.720
And very carefully.
we want to separate this

574
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.200
from the rest of the fish.

575
00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.760
OK.

576
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.640
Here we go.

577
00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.880
Opening up the fish.

578
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.080
Got a nice ant
that made a home in there.

579
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.880
And beautiful. look at that.

580
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.920
OK. here we have
the gill bars of the fish.

581
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.560
Those are the bars that hold
the filaments of the gills.

582
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.480
And between the gill bars.

583
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.560
all of these clusters
of round objects.

584
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.360
those are the ejecta spherules.

585
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.840
Ejecta spherules are tiny balls
that were once molten rock.

586
00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.440
They could be evidence
of what Robert suspects -

587
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.040
that creatures here died

588
00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.760
on the day
of the asteroid strike.

589
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.880
Those ejecta spherules
last saw the light of day

590
00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.880
when they were flying through
the air 66 billion years ago.

591
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.000
After a large asteroid impact.

592
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.760
a mix of vaporised and molten rock

593
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.880
is propelled into space.

594
00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.400
There. it cools.

595
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.600
solidifying
into tiny glass droplets.

596
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.280
Some carry on deeper into space.

597
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.760
But most are pulled back
to Earth by gravity.

598
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.120
After a major asteroid hit.

599
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.840
trillions of ejecta spherules
would fall from the sky.

600
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.040
Then. over millions of years.

601
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.040
pressure and chemical reactions
in the ground

602
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.200
would turn most of them to clay.

603
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.760
They'd look something like this.

604
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.960
So finding spherules
in the gills of a fish.

605
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.280
as Robert has done at Tanis.

606
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.680
suggests the fish sucked them in

607
00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.480
while the spherules
were still falling.

608
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.280
So these creatures could have died

609
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.160
at the time of an asteroid impact.

610
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.960
Once Robert begins to look
for ejecta spherules.

611
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.640
he finds more and more.

612
00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.040
and realises the thick.
crumbly layer of rock at Tanis

613
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.440
is full of them.

614
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.000
I mean. this stuff is go...
Oh. my God. look at that one.

615
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.960
These things are just gorgeous.

616
00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.840
Ejecta spherules like this

617
00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.440
give us a fingerprint
of where they came from.

618
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.120
If these spherules were connected

619
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.880
to the Chicxulub impact.

620
00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.000
then the whole crumbly layer
could be full of evidence

621
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.680
of what happened on the day
the asteroid hit.

622
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.960
That's a good one.

623
00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.360
Oh. is that a droplet right there?

624
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.320
To see if that's the case.

625
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.960
Robert needs to find a spherule
that hasn't turned to clay.

626
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.760
Oh. my God.
that's a beautiful droplet.

627
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.680
OK.

628
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.800
The small pieces of orange material

629
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.640
that Robert and Loren are digging up

630
00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.800
may be able to help.

631
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.840
They're amber.

632
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.320
If there was anything flying
through the air at that time.

633
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.160
this is where it's going to get
caught.

634
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.800
The amber they're collecting
was once sticky resin

635
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.920
oozing out of
a Late Cretaceous tree trunk.

636
00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.120
It's a way for the tree
to protect itself.

637
00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.920
like a scab forming on a cut.

638
00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.960
Anything covered by the resin
would be frozen

639
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.000
in an amber time capsule.

640
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.840
If they find a spherule
preserved in amber.

641
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.400
it could be analysed

642
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.560
to see if it comes from
the Chicxulub asteroid impact.

643
00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.080
So during this batch.

644
00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.640
we were incredibly lucky
that we came across

645
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.080
two completely unaltered spherules.

646
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.960
This spherule could be
something amazing.

647
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.600
Evidence preserved well enough
to analyse for chemical clues.

648
00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.880
If so.

649
00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.440
it could link Tanis directly
with the Chicxulub impact

650
00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.920
and the last day of the dinosaurs.

651
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.160
To investigate. Robert is joined

652
00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.240
at the Diamond Light Source

653
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.120
by Professor of Natural History
Phil Manning.

654
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.440
of the University of Manchester.

655
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.920
They've already run initial tests

656
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.920
on the spherules in America.

657
00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.800
What have you found out so far?

658
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.560
These little glass spherules.
these globs

659
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.520
of molten material
from the impact site

660
00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:55.960
have a chemical signal that ties it
with where they came from.

661
00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.480
Cos when an asteroid hits.

662
00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.680
it melts the ground that it hits.

663
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.920
but also that glass has

664
00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.520
a little bit of contamination
from the asteroid itself.

665
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.920
And that gives you a unique
geochemical fingerprint.

666
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.440
We can see once we've scanned it.

667
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.280
and looking at spherules from
other sites in North Dakota.

668
00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.960
we can get a baseline

669
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.200
for what the ejecta should look
like when it's related to

670
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.880
the Chicxulub crater.

671
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.440
And you can see each element here

672
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.480
and the ratios of those elements.

673
00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.720
And when we look at Tanis.
it's a match.

674
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.480
I mean. it perfectly overlays.

675
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.480
So I think
this is powerful evidence

676
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.080
supporting that Tanis
and Chicxulub are linked.

677
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.120
And what do these findings mean

678
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.040
for the rest of the fossils
that you're finding in Tanis?

679
00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.080
This data is key for the
entire site.

680
00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.360
because once you have that link

681
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.120
and you know
what impact affected Tanis.

682
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.760
then you essentially know
that every object in that site.

683
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.640
all the animals and the plants
and everything buried

684
00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.000
in those sediments.

685
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.640
are linked to the last day
of the Cretaceous.

686
00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.480
And the synchrotron here in the UK

687
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.040
reveals something even more
remarkable.

688
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:14.000
So this is showing
a beautiful synchrotron scan

689
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.400
of the half of one spherule.

690
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.240
The glass is
a good geochemical fingerprint.

691
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.920
and we've got calcium. some iron.

692
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.960
we've got strontium.

693
00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.760
but when we look at the
entire thing.

694
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.720
we see something quite unexpected.

695
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.880
That's your entire spherule.

696
00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.280
What's this?

697
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.280
In this. we've got
a little bit of a nugget.

698
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.520
There was a little particle
right there.

699
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.760
So we scan it.

700
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.240
And that's a lot of iron
in there.

701
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.080
Over here. we've got chromium.
a big peak in chromium.

702
00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.160
Over here. we've got
a big peak in nickel.

703
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.960
And the abundances
of iron. nickel and chromium.

704
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.400
all together.

705
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.120
that matches what you expect
to see in a meteoric body.

706
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.120
That does not match what you
would normally have down here.

707
00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.720
So this is
extraterrestrial material?

708
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.960
If you were to sort of grind up

709
00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:09.320
and stuff into a spherule
a piece of meteorite.

710
00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.200
that's what it's going to look
like.

711
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.560
This could be a piece of
the Chicxulub asteroid.

712
00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.760
A piece of the bullet
that killed the dinosaurs.

713
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.160
No!

714
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.320
Robert could have found

715
00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.680
a fragment of the asteroid itself
in Tanis.

716
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:35.440
physical evidence linking this site
to the Chicxulub impact.

717
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.680
But Tanis is almost 2.000 miles away

718
00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.600
from where the asteroid hit.

719
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:44.400
So exactly how did it cause
the creatures' deaths?

720
00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.200
To answer that question.

721
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.880
Robert is searching
in the mass death layer.

722
00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.280
Right here. we've got
this intertangled mass of fish.

723
00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.800
There's one fish here.
another sturgeon goes this way.

724
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.800
underneath the body of a paddlefish.

725
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.680
There's another sturgeon
that goes this way.

726
00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.240
underneath this log. and continues
out the other side.

727
00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.400
And his head hit that log

728
00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.760
and has deflected downward
at a 90-degree angle.

729
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.840
Robert uncovered a tangled mass of
fossilised creatures and logs

730
00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.040
surrounded by spherules

731
00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:29.480
and crushed together
in what's known as a logjam.

732
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.280
He has a theory that
the creatures were swept

733
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.760
to their death in some kind
of turbulent surge of water

734
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.120
and quickly entombed in sediment.

735
00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.960
which is why
they're so well preserved.

736
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.720
But what could have caused the wave?

737
00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:50.200
One theory is a tsunami.

738
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.880
The asteroid hit at sea.

739
00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.440
Recent studies show

740
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.480
it may have caused a wave
almost a mile high.

741
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.280
The height of the wave
would've gradually reduced

742
00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.520
as it spread across the oceans.

743
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.480
In the Late Cretaceous.

744
00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.600
North America was divided
by a narrow sea

745
00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.840
that's been called
the Western Interior Seaway.

746
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.640
The tsunami could have
travelled up this.

747
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.240
towards Tanis.

748
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.440
But there's a big question
about the tsunami idea.

749
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.000
The timing.

750
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.920
Oh. which fish is that?

751
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.040
That's a new...
It's a new contact.  New one. Yeah.

752
00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.920
If a tsunami killed the fish.

753
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.960
it would have to have hit

754
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.760
while ejecta spherules
were falling...

755
00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:02.160
..because spherules were found
in the fish's gills.

756
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:09.200
So how long after impact did
the spherules arrive at Tanis?

757
00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.680
Pretend this ball of foil
is a piece of ejecta

758
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.840
coming out of the crater. It would
then go on an arc path.

759
00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.840
ballistic trajectory.
out of the crater

760
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:19.400
and to wherever it lands -
in this case. Tanis.

761
00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.000
If we know the distance
between myself

762
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.360
and the landing site. and if we know
the size of that ball.

763
00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.560
we can accurately calculate how long
it would take to get there.

764
00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.480
The result is surprising.

765
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.960
Robert and his team calculated

766
00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.320
that these ejecta spherules
landed at Tanis

767
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.680
between 13 minutes
and two hours after the impact.

768
00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.320
If a wave killed the fish.

769
00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.680
it must also have reached Tanis
within two hours.

770
00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.040
Data from recent tsunamis show

771
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.400
even a powerful one would take much
longer than that

772
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:08.200
to travel almost 2.000 miles
from the impact site

773
00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.640
to Tanis.

774
00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.280
So if it wasn't a tsunami.

775
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.040
what could have caused
a surge of water at Tanis?

776
00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.320
Professor Stein Bondevik
is an expert in tsunamis.

777
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.720
The fjords in Norway
are very special.

778
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.120
We have tall mountains
surrounding bodies of water.

779
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.400
So the water is usually very calm.

780
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:51.120
In 2011. something very strange
happened.

781
00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:55.480
The water in the fjord
began to move violently.

782
00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:00.080
The height of the water increased
by one and a half metre.

783
00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:04.080
like a maelstrom
with the turbulent water.

784
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.800
Someone said
that the fjord was boiling.

785
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.400
THUNDER RUMBLES

786
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.240
News started to roll in -

787
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.520
there'd been an earthquake
5.000 miles away in Japan.

788
00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.240
A journalist from
the local newspaper called me.

789
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.160
and he said that
people were observing waves

790
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.560
here. in the fjords.

791
00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.160
I got a video clip of the waves.

792
00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.600
I saw immediately that they looked
like a tsunami wave.

793
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.440
So later in the afternoon.

794
00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.600
you can see that the fjord is
perfectly calm.

795
00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.480
But at the beach here.

796
00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.600
you could see that the water
is sloshing back and forth.

797
00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.560
and no-one had ever seen
anything like it.

798
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.120
And some people
got very upset and afraid.

799
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:59.560
A magnitude nine earthquake had
devastated the northeast of Japan.

800
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.560
around Fukushima.

801
00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:08.280
But how did that affect a fjord
so far away?

802
00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.840
So no-one in Norway
could feel the earthquake.

803
00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.400
but I could see that
the times matched

804
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.200
the arrival of the waves here.
in the fjord.

805
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.200
Eventually.
Stein and his team realised

806
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.960
that this might have something
to do with seismic waves -

807
00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:35.120
shock waves that pass quickly
through the Earth

808
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.680
during an earthquake.

809
00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.560
So it took only 12 minutes
before the first signal

810
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.240
of the earthquake in Japan
reached all the way here.

811
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.600
to western Norway.

812
00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.920
So it was the seismic waves

813
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.720
that caused the normally calm
water in the fjord

814
00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.680
to slosh turbulently
back and forth.

815
00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:02.440
Just thinking of that.
scientifically. it's fantastic.

816
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:12.360
Could something similar
have happened in Tanis?

817
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.680
A large weather front's
coming through the northwest...

818
00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.000
Trying to find out

819
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.240
is geophysicist professor
Mark Richards.

820
00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:25.800
who's been studying the site at
Tanis for several years.

821
00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.280
He's working with Robert
to discover

822
00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.120
what could have caused
a surge of water here.

823
00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:42.520
A tsunami can't get here
in less than minimum 12 hours.

824
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.240
But seismic waves travelling
from the Yucatan impact site

825
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:51.120
to North Dakota
can arrive here fairly quickly.

826
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:57.320
In the Late Cretaceous.
the Western Interior Seaway

827
00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:01.440
that divided North America could
have been connected to Tanis

828
00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.360
through a system of rivers.

829
00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.080
If you have
a very large body of water.

830
00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.080
like the Western Interior Seaway.

831
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.360
and you can shake it back and forth.

832
00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.600
you can generate
a large water wave

833
00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.200
coming up this river at Tanis.

834
00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:30.400
So seismic waves from the impact
could have caused

835
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.320
surges of water
in the Tanis river system.

836
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.560
The seismic waves
get here quickly enough.

837
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.920
coming up the Tanis river.

838
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.320
inundating this area.
arriving at the same time

839
00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.000
these spherules are
still falling out of the air.

840
00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.440
The mystery of the wave

841
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.760
and the thick layer of crumbly rock
has been solved.

842
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.280
Seismic waves travelling
through the Earth

843
00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:00.120
could have caused powerful surges of
water at Tanis...

844
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.240
..possibly carrying mud
and marine creatures.

845
00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.320
like ammonites. from the Western
Interior Seaway...

846
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.680
..dumping them on the Tanis sandbank
and burying everything

847
00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.600
at the same time as spherules fell.

848
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.240
Over millions of years.

849
00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:33.440
the mud would turn into
the layer of crumbly rock.

850
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.280
And that's the beauty of Tanis.

851
00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:40.400
What you're seeing is a deposit

852
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:44.760
that is literally recording
the last. say.

853
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.600
45 minutes to an hour and a half
of the Cretaceous.

854
00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:01.960
If the extinction
of the dinosaurs was a crime.

855
00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:06.240
the detective solving it
would have plenty of evidence.

856
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.160
They would see
that the asteroid was

857
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.760
in the right place
at the right time.

858
00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.360
They would see
that no dinosaurs survived

859
00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.800
after the hit.

860
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.120
They would have a piece
of the murder weapon -

861
00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.200
a fragment of the asteroid.

862
00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:24.160
But they would be missing
one very important thing -

863
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.720
a body.

864
00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:34.000
No-one has ever found
the fossil of a dinosaur

865
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.360
that was killed by the effects
of the asteroid impact.

866
00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.960
But Robert did find
part of a triceratops

867
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.280
in the crumbly layer at Tanis.

868
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.480
So could that be the remains

869
00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.360
of a dinosaur
that died on that day?

870
00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.880
I'm still dubious about the horn.

871
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.880
I kind of want to keep
the horn in the jacket.

872
00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.120
I think if you took it off.

873
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.760
at least take this section off.

874
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.400
to see what's going on under here.

875
00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.560
Yeah?

876
00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:03.400
To find out. the team needs to
establish cause of death.

877
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.760
which can be difficult when you only
have a piece of skin

878
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.880
and a horn to go on.

879
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.120
This is the horn
after they've cleaned it up.

880
00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:19.600
The team is particularly
interested in these lines here.

881
00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.200
And they found that the fractures go

882
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.800
right through the horn.

883
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:28.080
So rather than dying
as a result of the impact.

884
00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:31.440
they wondered whether
it had been killed in a fight.

885
00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.560
But when they looked at
the fractures in more detail.

886
00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.440
they found signs
of new bone growth here.

887
00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.880
An indication that
the bone had started to heal.

888
00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.440
So it looked as though
the triceratops survived

889
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.880
the event that broke its horn.

890
00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.280
Could this triceratops
have survived

891
00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:02.000
until the day of the impact?

892
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.640
The team found evidence.
including sagging in the skin.

893
00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:09.400
which suggested that
there was decay underneath.

894
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.800
That means its body had started
to rot

895
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:15.720
before it was entombed
and preserved by the surge.

896
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:20.760
So it seems that this dinosaur
didn't die as a result

897
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.720
of the asteroid impact.

898
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.520
Perhaps. in the months
before the impact.

899
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.600
the broken horn put the triceratops

900
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.040
at a disadvantage over its rivals.

901
00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:35.520
GRUNTS

902
00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:50.480
And that might have led
to starvation.

903
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.360
THUNDER CRACKS

904
00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.400
WIND WHOOSHES

905
00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.880
Robert has still not found
direct evidence

906
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.840
of a dinosaur that was killed
by the asteroid.

907
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:22.120
We've got all these bones
in the ground right now.

908
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.920
But the one thing
that we would just dream

909
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.880
of finding is that one dinosaur

910
00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.520
that died on the day of the impact.

911
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.560
And the weather
isn't helping his search.

912
00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.840
GROANS

913
00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.640
That therapod print is toasted.

914
00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.800
Yeah. it was in a low corner.

915
00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.840
Look. it's full mud.
It's full of mud and water.

916
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.000
The problem is it's wet. look.

917
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.720
See... If we're not careful.
we're going to lose the print.

918
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.160
And that's the biggest
theropod print we've got.

919
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.800
I see some areas that could use
glue right now. too.

920
00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.640
The team is racing
to excavate the footprints.

921
00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:22.080
along with dozens of fish fossils

922
00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:26.800
tangled together in a logjam.
before storms wash them away.

923
00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.160
THUNDER RUMBLES

924
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.760
We're up against the clock here.

925
00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:31.600
This stuff that could be
exposed right now

926
00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.440
is going to get ruined by the rain.

927
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.600
But then.
Robert comes across something

928
00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.280
that looks very unusual.

929
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.040
That's going there.

930
00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.320
What is going on right there?

931
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.680
Are we sure
this isn't crocodilian?

932
00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:49.680
That's not crocodilian.  No.

933
00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:52.280
Right. let me try
this piece right here.

934
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.920
I'll go in from the top
and then twist up.

935
00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.520
and it separates right on that line.

936
00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.040
Oh. that's skin right there.

937
00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.520
That's actually scaly skin.
Oh. my God.

938
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.360
No. no. no. no. no.
Look. look. look.

939
01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.320
Look at that pattern
right there.

940
01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.080
Have you ever seen elongated
scales like that before. Dave?

941
01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.320
That's insane.
Scuttelates - in birds.

942
01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.080
Just careful.

943
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.440
Oh. my God.
It's changing again.

944
01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.960
It's changing again.
Oh. my God.

945
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.760
We're seeing it for the first time
in 66 million years.

946
01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.720
I think we've got ourselves
a dinosaur.

947
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.000
A dinosaur fossil!

948
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.120
And. unlike the triceratops.

949
01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:36.360
this is located in the logjam.
the mass death layer.

950
01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.680
surrounded by the fish
with spherules in their gills.

951
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.440
This is the most incredible thing
that we could possibly imagine here.

952
01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.080
The best-case scenario.

953
01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.160
We're excavating
this mass death layer of fish

954
01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.040
from the surge
sent up by the impact.

955
01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.120
and we've got dinosaur remains.

956
01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.400
The one thing that we would always
want to find at this site.

957
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.720
and here we've got it.

958
01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.440
This is unreal. I-I-I cannot
process this in my brain.

959
01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.080
No. I am absolutely blown away
by this.

960
01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.520
Just my heart is literally
pumping out of my chest

961
01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.920
wondering what is behind there.

962
01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.120
just a couple of centimetres
back in the outcrop.

963
01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.760
What is waiting for us back there?

964
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.320
Get it out...

965
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.920
This is...

966
01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.240
The team keeps digging.

967
01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.200
The scales get big again
over on this side.

968
01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.760
So this could be a ribcage.

969
01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.920
it could be laying against ribs
that are curved.

970
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.480
There's something here.

971
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.960
That's hard.  A bit more bone.

972
01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.920
That's bone right next
to the skin.

973
01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.960
Yeah. that's an articular
surface right there.

974
01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.400
so this is either a hip
or a shoulder element.

975
01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.560
After hours
of painstaking work...

976
01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.160
And we can go
from the thigh of the animal.

977
01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.800
There's the knee.

978
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.520
And then you've got
the little calf muscles

979
01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.400
of the dinosaur.
they're bulging out.

980
01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.360
and you go down
to the anklebones.

981
01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.160
and these are the toes
of the feet.

982
01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.200
We have got nails
at the tips of the toes.

983
01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.040
It's a beautifully preserved leg.

984
01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.880
all articulated. covered with skin.

985
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.840
The complete leg of a dinosaur.

986
01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.880
In my wildest dreams.

987
01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.120
I never expected to find
a dinosaur leg in this deposit.

988
01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.480
Yeah. I mean. and then
it's got skin and tissue.

989
01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.960
It does look
just like a drumstick.

990
01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.840
It looks like
a Thanksgiving turkey.

991
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.600
just laid out in the ground.

992
01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.480
And this weird scale pattern
on the thigh of the animal.

993
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.240
which we've never seen
in a dinosaur before.

994
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:36.000
Well. thescelosaurs don't have
any form of defence.

995
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.240
so they have to have camouflage
or something.

996
01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.680
That's a good point.

997
01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:43.240
So this could have been some
sort of a camouflage marking.  Yeah.

998
01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.000
Robert thinks he has found
the body in question -

999
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.240
a dinosaur that might itself
have witnessed

1000
01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.080
the cataclysmic impact.

1001
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.560
Dinosaur fossils are not known

1002
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.440
from the last years
of the Cretaceous.

1003
01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.040
And it was unclear whether
they were already extinct

1004
01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.920
or in decline
or what was going on.

1005
01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.760
So they were just sort of absent.

1006
01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.760
And this answers that question.

1007
01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.360
Were dinosaurs still there then?

1008
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.480
Well. yes - this one likely
died in that surge.

1009
01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.920
For such big claims.
Robert needs verification.

1010
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.520
He's brought the dinosaur leg
to London

1011
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.200
to get a second opinion...

1012
01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.760
And then here are the pads
of the toes.

1013
01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.400
We see all those
beautiful scales lined up.

1014
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.720
..from Professor Paul Barrett.

1015
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.960
an expert
in ornithischian dinosaurs

1016
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.840
from the Natural History Museum.

1017
01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.120
So what do you think
this might be?

1018
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.000
When we look at the leg.
it has claws.

1019
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.600
like the claws we see in small.
agile. bipedal. running dinosaurs

1020
01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.000
that are plant-eaters.

1021
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
We can rule out things
like triceratops.

1022
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.400
partly just because
it's not big and stocky.

1023
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.600
And the proportions of those legs
are also different

1024
01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.880
from some of
the other plant-eaters we see.

1025
01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.760
in that they have
this rather long ankle

1026
01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.120
and shin. compared with its
thighbone.

1027
01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.160
So as we narrow
those possibilities down.

1028
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.640
what we're left with. probably.

1029
01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.480
is an animal called a thescelosaur.

1030
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.000
SQUEAKS

1031
01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.160
Thescelosaurs lived next to rivers

1032
01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.200
where there was plenty
of rich vegetation to feed on.

1033
01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.960
They had leaf-shaped teeth.

1034
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.000
common amongst herbivores.

1035
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.080
and claws
on their short front limbs -

1036
01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.240
excellent for digging.

1037
01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.960
SQUEAKS

1038
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.880
CRUNCHING

1039
01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.880
But how did
Robert's thescelosaur die?

1040
01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.400
Could it have been killed
by another dinosaur?

1041
01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.120
It's a possibility.

1042
01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.200
This is a relatively agile animal.

1043
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.360
And that turn of speed
would've been

1044
01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.360
its primary defence against the
large predators living alongside it.

1045
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.640
So. to escape a hungry T-rex.

1046
01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.040
a thescelosaur's first line
of defence...

1047
01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.360
BARKS

1048
01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.880
..would've been to run.

1049
01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.800
But it may have had
another defensive trick.

1050
01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.440
ROARS

1051
01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.840
Living next to rivers.

1052
01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.640
it's possible thescelosaurs
were able to swim.

1053
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.480
It doesn't seem to me
like there is any evidence

1054
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.160
that this animal was predated -

1055
01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.800
none of the obvious tooth marks

1056
01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.960
or leftover bits
of carnivore teeth

1057
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.040
to suggest it's been eaten.

1058
01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.600
So how do you think it died?

1059
01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.560
It didn't have any particularly
nasty diseases when it died.

1060
01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.280
as we can see
that the bones look OK.

1061
01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.240
So this is an animal
that was probably living

1062
01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.480
and healthy at the time
that this happened to it.

1063
01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:40.600
Could this be a victim
of the meteor strike?

1064
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.000
I think it's entirely possible.

1065
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.200
This is actually a shoulder bone.

1066
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.160
and this bone in a living animal

1067
01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.200
would actually be way over here.

1068
01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.000
And similarly. this little bone here

1069
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.800
would've been from about
maybe a third of the way

1070
01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.760
along the tail. maybe halfway down.

1071
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:59.320
So somehow these two bones
have been telescoped together.

1072
01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.760
So maybe this animal's
been tumbled around.

1073
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.400
We've ruled out
a lot of other possible

1074
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.360
causes of death for this animal.

1075
01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.320
So it could well be
that this is an animal

1076
01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.080
that was there. being tumbled around

1077
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.760
in its death throes. in that river.

1078
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.520
as a result of the asteroid impact.

1079
01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.440
Well. it is exactly analogous

1080
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.600
to those human bodies
found in Pompeii.

1081
01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.840
It's very similar in terms of
you get that quick entombment.

1082
01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.880
Yes. And it's almost as evocative.

1083
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.160
That's absolutely true.

1084
01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.440
You've got literally
the blink of an eye

1085
01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.320
at the end of the Cretaceous.

1086
01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.480
snapped up into history.
and there it is.

1087
01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.920
ready to be dug up.  Wow.

1088
01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.920
LAUGHS

1089
01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.600
After years of investigation.

1090
01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.880
Robert has found out a great deal

1091
01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.000
about the creatures
which lived at Tanis.

1092
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.600
and he knows that many of them were
alive on that fateful day

1093
01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.680
when the asteroid
devastated our planet.

1094
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.000
But how exactly did they die?

1095
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.840
Robert's finds now allow us
to tell the story of that day

1096
01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.320
and finally answer that question.

1097
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.600
One of the most important days
in Earth's history

1098
01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.520
probably started much like any
other late spring morning.

1099
01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.520
We know the season because Robert
found fossils of young fish that

1100
01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.200
died at the size they reach
at that time of year.

1101
01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.840
This agrees
with evidence already found

1102
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.880
by other scientists.

1103
01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.960
Perhaps this day. that would end
with so much death.

1104
01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.560
began with something different.

1105
01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.960
A new life.

1106
01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.400
SQUEAKING

1107
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.080
SQUAWKS

1108
01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:22.760
No-one can be certain
of the exact timings of the day

1109
01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:25.880
when the asteroid collided
with our planet.

1110
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.240
But it's estimated that within
just 40 minutes of the impact.

1111
01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.800
the consequences
for the creatures of Tanis

1112
01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.360
would have been profound.

1113
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.880
Based on Robert's finds

1114
01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.680
and the latest evidence
from other scientists.

1115
01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.160
this is how the catastrophe
might have unfolded.

1116
01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.360
The asteroid is around
seven miles across.

1117
01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.240
bigger than Mount Everest...

1118
01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:00.280
..and travelling at close
to 45.000mph.

1119
01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.280
The impact causes an explosion

1120
01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.440
bigger than a billion
Hiroshima atomic bombs.

1121
01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.600
At Tanis.
almost 2.000 miles away...

1122
01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.320
..it's completely silent.

1123
01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.240
But at the impact site...

1124
01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.480
..the asteroid vaporises.

1125
01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.880
More than three trillion
tonnes of rock

1126
01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.800
are ejected into space

1127
01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.440
in a blast
of super-heated violence.

1128
01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.160
Winds higher than 600mph.

1129
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:57.320
A colossal earthquake. followed
by a ring of massive tsunamis.

All the while.
the creatures at Tanis

1133

go about their business...

1134
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.800
CACOPHONY OF

1135
01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.120

SQUAWKS

1142
01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.880
The evidence suggests
that baby pterosaurs

1143
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.360
emerge from the egg
ready to fend for themselves.

1144
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.880
And that includes...

1145
01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.880
..flying?

1146
01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.960
Well. almost.

1147
01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:06.840
Elsewhere. as the devastation
spreads out across North America

1148
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.160
towards Tanis...

1149
01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.920
..dinosaurs and creatures
of all shapes and sizes

1150
01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.360
are obliterated by the blast.

1151
01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:30.320
At Tanis. for a few more
precious minutes.

1152
01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.040
life carries on as usual.

1153
01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.320
But the clock is ticking.

1154
01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.680
GRUNTING

1155

DEEP BELLOWING

1156
01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.600
The blast from the impact
never reaches Tanis.

1157
01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.120
but seismic shock waves do.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.200
They are far more powerful

1161
01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.640
than any earthquake
ever recorded.

1164
01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.680
The thescelosaur might head
for a place of safety...

1165
01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.800
..but seismic waves
are now slowly shaking

1166
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:37.200
the whole region. causing water
to slosh and churn.

1167
01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.600
At Tanis.
strange currents in the river

1168
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.240
give a hint
of what is still to come.

1169
01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.760
THUNDER CRACKS

1170
01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:00.120
Next. it begins to rain.

PATTERING

1172
01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.480
Ejecta spherules
are falling back to Earth.

1173
01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.280
As the spherules
begin their fall...

1174
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.720
..friction heats them
until they're red hot.

1175
01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:30.560
Then the heat transfers
to the air.

1176
01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.320
Temperatures rise with every second.

1177
01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.080
As the heat builds.
the creatures of Tanis

1178
01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.720
are fighting for their lives.

1179
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.280
ROARS

1180
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.320
And then. as seismic waves

1181
01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.120
continue to slowly rock
the whole region...

1182
01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.960
..a violent surge wave
ten metres high

1183
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.280
rushes up the Tanis river.

1184
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.680
Surviving the turbulence
of the surge

1185
01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.840
is a challenge
even for the best swimmers.

1186
01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:47.600
Then. the powerful rocking
of the river system

1187
01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.240
slowly begins to draw the water
back the way it came.

1188
01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.640
Swimming may have saved

1189
01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:05.320
the thescelosaur in the past.

1190
01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.120
but not this time.

1191
01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.320
A large. robust animal
like a T-rex

1192
01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.400
might have survived the surge.

1193
01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.240
As might a hard-shelled reptile.

1194
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.760
But there is much more to come.

1195
01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.880
As billions of tonnes of superheated
spherules continue to fall.

1196
01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.200
the atmosphere gets even hotter...

1197
01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.760
..igniting dead leaves
and sparking wildfires.

1198
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.680
Earthquakes.

1199
01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.640
fire...

1200
01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.240
..devastation.

1201
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.800
Little would survive for long.

1202
01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.640
on land..

1203
01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.880
ROARS

1204
01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.080
..or in the air.

1205
01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:15.400
SHRIEKS

1206
01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.280
GRUNTS

1207
01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.280
As the air reaches the temperature
of an industrial oven...

1208
01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.320
..those that live
deep underground

1209
01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.880
may have a better chance.

1210
01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:52.360
As the slow sloshing of
the river system continues...

1211
01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.600
..another powerful surge hits.

1212
01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:21.080
There is no escaping
the destruction.

1213
01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.280
For many of the creatures
of Tanis.

1214
01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.680
their stories end underwater.

1215
01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:49.520
In less than two hours.
the world has changed forever.

1216
01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.960
The mud the surge waves leave behind

1217
01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:02.960
will gradually turn into the thick
layer of crumbly rock

1218
01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:05.880
entombing the creatures
which died here...

1219
01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.880
..until 66 million years later.

1220
01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.200
when they're finally unearthed.

1221
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.920
Robert's finds have helped us
understand in remarkable detail

1222
01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.600
what happened at Tanis

1223
01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.120
in the minutes
after the asteroid impact.

1224
01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:35.280
But what about
the rest of the world?

1225
01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:41.240
The impact triggered catastrophic
events

1226
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:44.120
such as earthquakes all over
the planet.

1227
01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.240
And as spherules
continued to fall...

1228
01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.560
..wildfires may have sprung up
around the globe.

1229
01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.600
As that horrific day
drew to a close.

1230
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:04.400
many of the world's dinosaurs
were already dead.

1231
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:14.440
Research shows that the angle
at which the asteroid hit

1232
01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:17.440
and the sulphur-rich rocks
at the impact site

1233
01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.720
amplified the devastation.

1234
01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.680
Billions of tonnes of sulphur

1235
01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.960
were ejected into the atmosphere.

1236
01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.840
blocking the sunlight.

1237
01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:32.800
Without light. most plants died.
and food became scarce.

1238
01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.280
As the weeks and months passed.

1239
01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.680
any dinosaur left alive
would've died of hunger.

1240
01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.240
In the oceans. it was the same.

1241
01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.560
Nearly all of the world's
plankton disappeared.

1242
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.600
leading to the starvation
of most marine creatures.

1243
01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.720
It's thought that the nuclear
winter that followed

1244
01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.360
caused a global temperature drop

1245
01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.320
of at least
25 degrees centigrade.

1246
01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:08.320
The fossil record tells us that this
huge change in climate

1247
01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:12.200
marked the disappearance of three
quarters of all species.

1248
01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.040
including the dinosaurs.

1249
01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:21.080
The planet was in semi-darkness
for around a decade.

1250
01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.280
as dust and soot
slowly fell to Earth.

1251
01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.440
But then came something wonderful.

1252
01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.040
A new beginning.

1253
01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.160
Once the dust cleared
from the atmosphere

1254
01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.840
and the sunlight returned...

1255
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:46.000
..plant life was gradually restored.

1256
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.960
led by ferns.

1257
01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:52.160
the spores of which had lain
dormant deep underground.

1258
01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:56.160
and the world began
to turn green once more.

1259
01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.480
But what about the animals?

1260
01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:06.520
Back at Tanis.
Robert has unearthed something

1261
01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:09.320
that could have helped save
some of the creatures

1262
01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.920
from the devastating fires.

1263
01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.560
We saw a little thing
poking out.

1264
01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.560
so we kind of followed it back.

1265
01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.600
And I'm so glad that we did.

1266
01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.920
because what we have here
is a fossil burrow

1267
01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:22.680
from an animal 66 million years ago.

1268
01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.680
The only animals that
would've been around back then

1269
01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.960
that would likely build
a burrow like this

1270
01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.880
would be the small mammals.
roughly ferret-sized.

1271
01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.440
and also some reptiles.

1272
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:38.680
If it is from a mammal.
this is sort of a window

1273
01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.560
into the lifestyle of some of
our oldest ancestors out here.

1274
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.640
This guy would've burrowed
sideways.

1275
01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.080
right into the river bank.

1276
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.480
We actually have
some scratch marks on there

1277
01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.680
from the interior
when they were digging it.

1278
01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.560
going back.
and he would've lived back here

1279
01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.360
and sought shelter
from the dinosaurs

1280
01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.640
cos they just did not
want to get eaten.

1281
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.280
Burrows are part of the reason

1282
01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.320
that mammals survived
the great extinction.

1283
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.880
During the nuclear winter.

1284
01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.080
a burrow would've provided warmth.

1285
01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:19.280
protection.
and a place to store food.

1286
01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.880
Mammals that survived
were resourceful omnivores.

1287
01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.680
and insects would've been
a plentiful source of food.

1288
01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:43.120
And they had another advantage -
their size.

1289
01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.240
If conditions are right.
many animal species get larger

1290
01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.200
as they evolve
over millions of years.

1291
01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:55.680
Take T-rex as an example.

1292
01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.960
This is a cast of the lower jaw

1293
01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:01.600
of a predecessor. called
gorgosaurus.

1294
01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.360
which lived
72 million years ago.

1295
01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:10.280
Whereas this is the cast
of the lower jaw of a T-rex.

1296
01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:12.880
which lived
five million years later.

1297
01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:16.800
Look at the difference in size.

1298
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.200
But the bigger the creature.

1299
01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.760
the more energy they need
to stay alive.

1300
01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:24.600
So when catastrophe strikes
and food is scarce.

1301
01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:26.960
the largest tend to die out.

1302
01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.920
whilst the smallest
often survive.

1303
01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.960
That's one of the reasons

1304
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.400
why many of the smaller mammals

1305
01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.200
lived through the great darkness.

1306
01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.240
And they weren't alone.

1307
01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.960
Robert's fossil turtle
may have been unlucky.

1308
01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.680
but many others survived.

1309
01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:56.000
As did crocodiles.

1310
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.800
snakes.

1311
01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:00.720
and many fish species.

1312
01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.480
And as for the dinosaurs.

1313
01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.960
did the impact
really kill them all?

1314
01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:09.640
Well. this beautiful
fossilised feather

1315
01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:11.680
isn't from a bird.

1316
01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.840
but from a predatory dinosaur.

1317
01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.560
So we have to be careful

1318
01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.800
when we say
that dinosaurs are extinct.

1319
01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.880
because what we call birds
originally evolved

1320
01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:25.920
from the smallest
feathered dinosaurs.

1321
01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.160
So to be correct. we should say

1322
01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:32.120
all non-avian dinosaurs
are extinct.

1323
01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.080
Robert's finds have given us

1324
01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.400
a better idea
than ever before...

1325
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.800
..about what happened on the day
that led to the extinction...

1326
01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.360
..of the largest beasts
ever to walk the Earth.

1327
01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.000
Dinosaurs were perhaps

1328
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.440
some of nature's
most extraordinary creatures.

1329
01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.520
dominating the planet
for over 150 million years

1330
01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.480
before they became extinct.

1331
01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.040
But extinction
comes in different forms.

1332
01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.320
and many of the amazing creatures

1333
01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:16.760
and plants alive today
are also threatened.

1334
01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.760
It's possible that humanity
is having

1335
01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.120
as big an impact on the world

1336
01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:26.880
as the asteroid that ended
the age of the dinosaurs.

1337
01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.440
As human beings.
we are unique in our ability

1338
01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.520
to learn from the distant past.

1339
01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:38.640
Now we must use that ability
wisely and do our very best

1340
01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:41.040
to protect the millions of species

1341
01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:45.520
for whom. alongside us.
this planet is home.
