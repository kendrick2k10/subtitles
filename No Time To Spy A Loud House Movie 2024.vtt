00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.016
Hey. watch it!
This is a lease!

4
00:00:50.318 --> 00:00:53.754
I think it's time
we go our separate ways.

5
00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.956
<i>Agent 28.
what are you doing?</i>

6
00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:59.693
What I do best.
Improvising.

7
00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:28.889
Can you be a doll

8
00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.858
and open that door
over there for me?

9
00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.793
Ah! Ah!

10
00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.530
Thanks. hon.

11
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.703
X. I'm in.

12
00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:44.705
<i>And only 23 seconds.</i>

13
00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.507
<i>I owe you lunch. Myrtle.</i>

14
00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:48.942
Actually. it was 22.5.

15
00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.745
But what's a half a second
between gal pals?

16
00:01:55.316 --> 00:01:56.917
So what's the situation?

17
00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:58.352
You should have
a straight shot

18
00:01:58.352 --> 00:01:59.853
to Dr. Dufu's rocket.

19
00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:02.423
<i>I checked the visuals.
and it's all clear.</i>

20
00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:03.791
Are you sure?

21
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:06.093
There's got to be at least
one more henchman.

22
00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:07.995
<i>Have I ever
steered you wrong?</i>

23
00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:11.665
<i>Ooh.
My bad.</i>

24
00:02:15.203 --> 00:02:17.070
Ow!
Ugh.

25
00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:22.710
Ah!

26
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.285
Hiyah!

27
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.722
<i>Facial access granted.</i>

28
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:50.103
Oh. hello. Agent 28.

29
00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:53.106
I was wondering
when you'd get here.

30
00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:57.044
I must say. I'm flattered
they sent the best.

31
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.681
Don't get too excited.

32
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:04.184
It's gonna be a quick visit!

33
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.053
Oh!

34
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.063
What do you think
of my most loyal henchman?

35
00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:17.498
Ham Hand.

36
00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:18.999
He came to me after his hand

37
00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.034
was crushed
in a wrestling match.

38
00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.704
so I forged him a hammer hand.

39
00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:26.307
I think
his name is confusing.

40
00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:28.909
I expected pork.

41
00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.311
Oh!

42
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:33.314
I thought you'd be tougher
than this. Agent 28.

43
00:03:33.314 --> 00:03:35.783
And not a curl out of place.

44
00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:38.552
Oh. will you please
stop talking about the hair?

45
00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:41.021
It's always about the hair.

46
00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:49.963
So what's the deal
with your dumb rocket anyway?

47
00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:52.633
You see those lasers?

48
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:55.736
This rocket will take out

49
00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:58.339
every communication satellite
on Earth.

50
00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.641
And then I launch my own.

51
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:04.545
Dufu TV. Dufu Phone.
Dufu Electric.

52
00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:06.980
Dufu Daily News!

53
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.950
My beautiful wife
Schmoofy Doofy and I

54
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.122
will own all communication
and rule the world!

55
00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:16.757
Boop.

56
00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:19.527
<i>T minus
one minute until lunch.</i>

57
00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:21.329
Not today. doofus.

58
00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.564
I've got lunch plans.

59
00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:26.600
It's pronounced Dufu.
It's French!

60
00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:30.538
- Ha!
- Hey. get back in your cage.

61
00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:33.907
Ooh.

62
00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:36.710
- Hold still.
- Ah!

63
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.747
Hey. you messed up
Ham Hand's do.

64
00:04:39.747 --> 00:04:41.715
Well. let me fix that
for you.

65
00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:50.057
Oh. no. stop it!

66
00:04:50.057 --> 00:04:52.192
Give me it! Hey!
- Ow!

67
00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:54.528
- Ugh!

68
00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:00.668
<i>No!</i>

69
00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:02.002
I know I just tried
to kill you.

70
00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:04.338
but get me out of here!

71
00:05:05.606 --> 00:05:07.475
<i>You need to shut down
the launch.</i>

72
00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:09.943
Yep. working on it.

73
00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:13.881
<i>You stopped the lasers.
not the launch.</i>

74
00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:17.651
<i>Three. two. one.</i>

75
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:22.590
- No!

76
00:05:26.594 --> 00:05:29.229
X. how do we get doofus
back down?

77
00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.898
<i>You won't be
seeing him again.</i>

78
00:05:30.898 --> 00:05:33.300
<i>That rocket is
a one way ticket into orbit.</i>

79
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.369
Well. that's a shame.

80
00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:37.605
But at least he got
a room with a view.

81
00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.908
That was your best
Myrtle spy story yet.

82
00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:42.510
Ten out of ten
on the showmanship.

83
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.177
Thanks. Clyde.

84
00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.013
I can't wait to have
a secret agent for a Gran-Gran.

85
00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:48.516
Just think--
jet setting across the world.

86
00:05:48.516 --> 00:05:51.452
going on spy missions together.
doing dropkicks.

87
00:05:51.452 --> 00:05:53.387
Whoa.

88
00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:56.023
You're seriously about to
have the coolest grandma ever.

89
00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:57.791
Don't tell Nana Gale
I said that.

90
00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:00.327
Look alive. Loud crowd.

91
00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:02.863
I'm here. and I'm ready
to load bags.

92
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:04.264
Who's getting married?

93
00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:06.199
We're getting married.

94
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.436
Gran-Gran.

95
00:06:08.436 --> 00:06:09.870
Perfect timing.

96
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.338
I was just telling Clyde
about the time

97
00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:13.306
you saved the world
from Dr. Dufu.

98
00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:15.443
Oh Lincoln.
that was ages ago.

99
00:06:15.443 --> 00:06:18.145
All I can think about
right now is the wedding.

100
00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:20.414
I'm about to marry
the man of my dreams

101
00:06:20.414 --> 00:06:22.616
and finally have a family.

102
00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:24.251
Speaking of the wedding.

103
00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:26.854
if any spy business goes down
this weekend and you need help.

104
00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:28.221
I'm your man.

105
00:06:30.924 --> 00:06:32.660
Actually.
I do need your help.

106
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.861
Yeah?

107
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:36.096
With a super important
mission.

108
00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:37.097
Yeah?

109
00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:39.232
That only you can do.

110
00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.968
Yeah?

111
00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:43.203
Operation wedding rings.

112
00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:46.440
I need you to guard these
with your life.

113
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.609
Oh. I thought
you were gonna ask me

114
00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:50.143
to go on a real mission.

115
00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:52.446
Oh. honey. this is real.

116
00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:54.047
They aren't insured.

117
00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.917
I'm gonna head out.
Lincoln.

118
00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:57.885
Hoo. ha. huh.

119
00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.253
Have fun at the wedding.

120
00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:02.923
Let's kick it into gear. kiddos.

121
00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:06.026
Butts need to be in Vanzilla
in 10 minutes.

122
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.767
- Hey. watch it.

123
00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.969
I can't find anything.

124
00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:19.840
Has anyone seen
my vacation coffin?

125
00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.545
Now to pack the essentials.

126
00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.680
David Steele fart spray.

127
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.081
David Steele grappling hook.

128
00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:29.850
David Steele throwing stars.

129
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.520
Oh. those are sharp.

130
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.523
Hm. I feel like I'm
forgetting something important.

131
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.058
Of course.

132
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.964
My David Steele spy watch.

133
00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:47.535
Charles!

134
00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:50.237
Lincoln.
I'm flower girling here.

135
00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:52.405
Drop it.
We don't have time to play.

136
00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:55.375
- Hey. watch it. Stinkoln.

137
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:58.178
- Get back here.
- Now. where were we?

138
00:07:58.178 --> 00:08:02.650
3. 23. hut. hut. hut.

139
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.852
Lynn. don't throw so hard.

140
00:08:04.852 --> 00:08:06.920
You want to catch
Myrtle's flowers or not?

141
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.189
It's called a bouquet.
and duh.

142
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:11.525
Whoever catches it
totes gets married next.

143
00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:14.294
Oh. can you imagine
Bobby and I's wedding?

144
00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:17.931
LJ. where's your suitcase?

145
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:19.266
Don't need one.

146
00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:20.734
Yeah. I'm wearing
all the underwear

147
00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:22.502
I plan on taking.

148
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.873
That's clever. wow.
- Heads up. Pops.

149
00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:29.142
Here's Lily's bag.
- No. no. no. no! Ah!

150
00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:32.012
Nice catch. Loud.
Hello.

151
00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.647
I'm here to watch
your dang house.

152
00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:36.216
Mr. Grouse.
as our acting groundskeeper.

153
00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:38.451
I need you to keep
a watchful eye on this.

154
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.520
What?
Is that a TV remote?

155
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.456
Don't make me laugh.

156
00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.068
My nuclear fusion laser.

157
00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:57.270
My rivals have been eyeing it
for months.

158
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.339
Guard it with your life
and by no means press any--

159
00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:01.942
How do I get the news
on here?

160
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.583
You owe an apology
to the country of Finlandistan.

161
00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:11.919
Get back here
with my watch. Charles.

162
00:09:14.922 --> 00:09:16.690
This is a collectible.

163
00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:22.429
My house!

164
00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:24.031
Well.
look at the bright side.

165
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:25.833
Now you have satellite TV.

166
00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:27.067
Oh.

167
00:09:28.636 --> 00:09:30.137
All packed.

168
00:09:30.137 --> 00:09:32.840
You got our wedding rings
in there. right kiddo?

169
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.675
The wedding rings?

170
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.348
Right.
Uh. they must be in my room.

171
00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:44.618
Be right back.
- All right. kids. time to go.

172
00:09:44.618 --> 00:09:47.988
- Ugh.

173
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.292
Initiating vacation mode.

174
00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:54.561
Lincoln. come on.
We're gonna be late.

175
00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:55.996
<i>I got the rings.</i>

176
00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.003
Myrtle!

177
00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:05.372

Adorable kids.

187
00:10:51.284 --> 00:10:52.585
Are all of them yours?

188
00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.588
Different mothers. I assume.
I'm Fifi.

189
00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:57.024
Oh. hi.
I'm Lin.

190
00:10:57.024 --> 00:10:59.927
Sorry. I get
a little plane sick.

191
00:11:02.229 --> 00:11:05.398
Oh.

192
00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:12.439
Ah!

193
00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.778
Lily. that's not
a diving board.

194
00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:22.315
How's it going. sweetie?
- Never better.

195
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.821
I can taste
other people's breath.

196
00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:29.322
Ugh.

197
00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.228
Ow.

198
00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:38.098
- Yo. Lori. heads up.
- Lynn.

199
00:11:38.098 --> 00:11:40.300
I said not on the plane.

200
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.836
Ooh. tie-dye.

201
00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:45.839
Oh. how about a couple's
massage on the beach. huh?

202
00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:50.443
Oh. never eat
the airplane sashimi.

203
00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:53.346
Oh.
I'll be right back.

204
00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.517
Is there something
in your eye. hon?

205
00:11:57.517 --> 00:11:59.686
No. I just wanted
to let you know.

206
00:11:59.686 --> 00:12:01.288
Whoa.

207
00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:03.423
I've located the exits
in case an evil villain

208
00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:06.059
is hiding in the cargo hold
waiting to take us captive.

209
00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:08.095
Oh. honey.
there's no bad guys

210
00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:09.897
on this plane.
and trust me.

211
00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:12.232
if there were.
you don't want to meet them.

212
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:16.136
It's not all fun and games like
your picture book Derek Stump.

213
00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:17.838
David Steele.

214
00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:21.274
There are real consequences
to spy life. dangerous ones.

215
00:12:21.274 --> 00:12:23.110
But you're just a kid.

216
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.712
and I don't expect you
to get it.

217
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.253
Hey. did that Stump fellow
ever throw a villain

218
00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.422
off Mount Everest
while deliriously low

219
00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:38.291
on oxygen?
Cause I did.

220
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:40.327
Whoa. really?

221
00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:42.830
So there I was
in-hand-to hand combat

222
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.064
at the highest peak

223
00:12:44.064 --> 00:12:46.299
and slowly
losing consciousness.

224
00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:48.168
The odds of me
making it out alive

225
00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:49.837
were slim to none.

226
00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:53.273
Whoops.
Coming through.

227
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.707
Hey. what's wrong. Al?

228
00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:57.510
Well. sometimes hearing about
Myrtle's past

229
00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.246
makes me worry.
maybe I'm not

230
00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:00.881
exciting enough for her.

231
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:03.984
Maybe I'm a little
small potatoes. you know?

232
00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:06.786
Al. that's ridiculous.
You're not a small potato.

233
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:10.123
Who just won Sunset Canyon's
shuffleboard showdown?

234
00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.691
Seymour.

235
00:13:11.691 --> 00:13:13.460
Oh. yeah.

236
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.794
That guy's incredible.

237
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.200
And that's why
I love free napkins.

238
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.435
Never know
when they'll save your life.

239
00:13:22.435 --> 00:13:24.204
Well. enough about that.

240
00:13:24.204 --> 00:13:26.173
Let's go over
the wedding playlist.

241
00:13:26.173 --> 00:13:27.908
Psst. Gran-Gran.
I'm pretty sure

242
00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:30.277
that flight attendant
is listening to us.

243
00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:33.346
Sweetie. you're being silly.

244
00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:36.884
I bet she's undercover.
gathering intel on us.

245
00:13:36.884 --> 00:13:38.318
Oh. no. I ate the peanuts.

246
00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.587
There's probably a tracking
device in my stomach.

247
00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:45.558
I really. really
don't think so.

248
00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:47.527
Lincoln.
you already have a mission.

249
00:13:47.527 --> 00:13:50.297
You still got those rings?
- Don't worry.

250
00:13:50.297 --> 00:13:51.798
They're safe inside the box.

251
00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:53.833
I'm going back to my seat
to read comics.

252
00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:57.270
Ah!

253
00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.741
Lori. go long.
Hut. hut. hut.

254
00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:07.447
Oh. cold. cold!
Oh. is that citrus?

255
00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:09.983
Oh. it's a deep burn.

256
00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:12.485
Sorry about that.
Lori doesn't know how to catch.

257
00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:15.588
- Lynn.
- Way to make enemies already.

258
00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:19.326
Relax.
We'll never see her again.

259
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:25.832
So we're staying
at the same place.

260
00:14:25.832 --> 00:14:28.168
Tight.

261
00:14:40.147 --> 00:14:42.415
Ooh!

262
00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.000
Ooh.

263
00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:03.937
Welcome to
the Thunderball Resort.

264
00:15:03.937 --> 00:15:05.538
Can I get you a hot towel?

265
00:15:05.538 --> 00:15:08.675
- Lori. think fast.
- Stop it. Lynn.

266
00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:10.443
- Ahem.

267
00:15:10.443 --> 00:15:13.313
That'll be 20 big ones
for the hot towel.

268
00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:16.583
Yo. Mom.
this sounds like a you problem.

269
00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:19.452
You know. you bear
a striking resemblance

270
00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:22.055
to someone.
Do you know a Flip Phillipini?

271
00:15:22.055 --> 00:15:23.223
I sure do.

272
00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:24.891
I'm Flap Phillipini.

273
00:15:26.893 --> 00:15:28.428
Flip's my cousin.

274
00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:31.031
Huh.
What are the chances?

275
00:15:31.031 --> 00:15:33.100
One in one billion. five--

276
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.302
Charge it to the room. Flap.

277
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.605
I have you all checked in.

278
00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:42.375
Ceviche. can I get these people
some keys. please?

279
00:15:44.077 --> 00:15:45.645
Thank you. Ceviche.

280
00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:47.680
OK. girls.
let's head to the pool

281
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.950

for tonight.

282
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.085
Yeah!

283
00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:53.853
Don't forget about Todd.
y'all.

284
00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:55.555
I'm gonna go meet
with the caterer

285
00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:56.856
and go over the menu.

286
00:15:56.856 --> 00:15:59.326
And I was planning
on taking my Myrtle buns

287
00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:02.195
on a surprise fishing trip.
Surprise!

288
00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:05.865
Oh. Al.
How romantic.

289
00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:07.934
Ooh. you guys
are going on a boat?

290
00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:10.603
That sounds awesome.

291
00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:14.541
Oh. did you want to come.
Lincoln?

292
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:16.343
I don't have
anything else to do.

293
00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:18.278
I'll go grab my spy stuff.

294
00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:20.747
Lincoln. you don't need it.

295
00:16:20.747 --> 00:16:23.450
Don't you kids
go anywhere without me.

296
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.218
Hey. watch it. kid.

297
00:16:25.218 --> 00:16:28.521
You wouldn't want to bump into
the wrong guy on this island.

298
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:30.190
Yeah. yeah. I got it.

299
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:34.894
The truck's all loaded
for. uh. the fishing trip.

300
00:16:34.894 --> 00:16:36.629

No sign of mohawk man.

There's something going on.

I wonder
what's in those crates.

312
00:17:20.073 --> 00:17:21.374
Wait.

313
00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.610
My David Steele

I used to fish with a spear.

Oh. Al.
That's so rugged.

320
00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:49.636

324
00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.014

325
00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:03.616
I don't know what.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.435
Got it.

359
00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:31.604
<i>♪ As they'll all win alone ♪</i>

360
00:19:34.241 --> 00:19:36.243
Oh. not what I meant to do.

361
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.780
That's right. fish.
Come to Pop-Pop.

362
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.049
Lincoln. hit the gas now.

363
00:19:48.588 --> 00:19:53.526
<i>♪ Lonely times before ♪</i>

364
00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:56.896
Whoa.

365
00:20:05.572 --> 00:20:07.507
Aw. cheap lures.

366
00:20:07.507 --> 00:20:09.576
Oh.
Sorry. Al.

367
00:20:09.576 --> 00:20:12.078
Lincoln needs aloe vera ASAP.

368
00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:13.480
He's in sun shock.

369
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.283
OK. let's get my best man
back to the resort.

370
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.622
Oh. don't worry. Myrtle dove.

371
00:20:22.622 --> 00:20:25.091
I'm gonna make up
for not catching anything.

372
00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:26.926
Tonight.
you'll have the best table

373
00:20:26.926 --> 00:20:30.597
at the best restaurant.
- Can't wait.

374
00:20:30.597 --> 00:20:33.666
Um. I'll get some cold towels
for Linc.

375
00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:35.702
Ooh.

376
00:20:35.702 --> 00:20:36.969
Lincoln. now listen to me.

377
00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:38.738
I know
what you're gonna say.

378
00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.607
It's too bad cargo shorts
fell in the ocean

379
00:20:40.607 --> 00:20:42.909
with my camera.
or we'd have some clues.

380
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:45.445
What? No.
We don't need clues.

381
00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:47.680
We are leaving immediately.

382
00:20:48.948 --> 00:20:50.950
Myrtle.
Long time no talk.

383
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.219
What's it been. 30 years?

384
00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:55.388
Sorry. X.
No time to catch up.

385
00:20:55.388 --> 00:20:56.856
Our fishing boat
was just attacked

386
00:20:56.856 --> 00:20:58.591
after my fiancé's grandson

387
00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:00.226
witnessed a shady deal
going down.

388
00:21:00.226 --> 00:21:01.894
I'm sending you
our coordinates

389
00:21:01.894 --> 00:21:04.331
so you can have an agent
check into it.

390
00:21:04.331 --> 00:21:06.866
Myrtle. can you do it?
You're right there.

391
00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:08.635
Yes. we accept the mission.

392
00:21:08.635 --> 00:21:11.604
No. we do not accept.
Lincoln. zip it.

393
00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:15.775
X. I retired.
and I have a family now.

394
00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:18.044
<i>I'm about to get married.</i>
- I know.

395
00:21:18.044 --> 00:21:19.646
And an invite
would have been classy.

396
00:21:19.646 --> 00:21:21.080
<i>but let's table that.</i>

397
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.650
I'm sorry. but I have
to get us off this island

398
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.886
on the first flight tomorrow.
I'll call you when we're safe.

399
00:21:26.886 --> 00:21:28.755
But Gran-Gran.
think about it.

400
00:21:28.755 --> 00:21:30.289
This is our chance
to be heroes.

401
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:34.193
You and me. working together.
the ultimate spy duo.

402
00:21:34.193 --> 00:21:36.896
Let's call her back.
- Lincoln. just stop it.

403
00:21:36.896 --> 00:21:38.331
You don't understand
what it means

404
00:21:38.331 --> 00:21:39.699
to be a real hero.

405
00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:41.501
It's not about
ticking time bombs.

406
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:44.270
high-tech gadgets.
and invisible laser shields.

407
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.706
They make
invisible laser shields?

408
00:21:46.706 --> 00:21:48.575
Being a hero
is about sacrifice.

409
00:21:48.575 --> 00:21:51.578
It's making a tough choice
even if you don't like it.

410
00:21:51.578 --> 00:21:55.181
And right now that means
getting your family to safety.

411
00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:56.248
Hey. party of--

412
00:21:56.248 --> 00:21:57.984
- Oops.

413
00:21:57.984 --> 00:21:59.752
Old habits die hard.

414
00:21:59.752 --> 00:22:01.754
I better check on Flop.

415
00:22:05.625 --> 00:22:08.995
I know what a hero is.

416
00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:11.230
and they don't
turn down missions.

417
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.899
Hey. X. Myrtle here.

418
00:22:12.899 --> 00:22:15.201
Totes changed my mind
about the mission. LOL.

419
00:22:15.201 --> 00:22:16.803
We're on it.

420
00:22:16.803 --> 00:22:18.337
Strong arm emoji.
high five emoji.

421
00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:19.639
party emoji. and--

422
00:22:19.639 --> 00:22:21.107
Stopped the bleeding.

423
00:22:21.107 --> 00:22:23.309
but he'll definitely
need to ice that.

424
00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:24.977
I'm sorry. Gran-Gran.

425
00:22:24.977 --> 00:22:26.946
You were right
about everything.

426
00:22:26.946 --> 00:22:28.981
I'll go pack my stuff now.

427
00:22:28.981 --> 00:22:31.918
Good.
I knew I could count on you.

428
00:22:31.918 --> 00:22:33.620
I'll go talk to Pop-Pop.

429
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:38.491
And Lincoln. I'm proud of you
for handling this so well.

430
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.297
Yes.

431
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.369
Yoo-hoo. white haired boy.

432
00:22:51.571 --> 00:22:53.072
Oh. I was just looking
for sea glass

433
00:22:53.072 --> 00:22:55.341
on the beach
for my dog jewelry business.

434
00:22:55.341 --> 00:22:57.810
I make collars.
harnesses. cuff-links.

435
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.480
but I call them ruff-links.

436
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.782
Sorry. I don't have any cash.

437
00:23:02.782 --> 00:23:06.519
Oh. you're a riot.
A riot.

438
00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:08.421
I'm not selling you.

439
00:23:08.421 --> 00:23:10.089
I just found your camera.

440
00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:13.693
It washed up on shore.
I also found cargo shorts.

441
00:23:13.693 --> 00:23:15.127
I think I'll make them
into curtains.

442
00:23:15.127 --> 00:23:16.896
But with pockets.

443
00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:18.865
Neat. huh?
- Thank you. thank you.

444
00:23:18.865 --> 00:23:20.733
I can't believe you found it.

445
00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:22.769
Oh. it's so cute
how you wrote

446
00:23:22.769 --> 00:23:26.005
"property of Lincoln Loud.
super spy."

447
00:23:26.005 --> 00:23:28.708
You know. I used to play spy
when I was eight too.

448
00:23:28.708 --> 00:23:31.377
Actually I'm 12.
but thanks again.

449
00:23:31.377 --> 00:23:33.846
Just give me a call
for all your ruff-link--

450
00:23:33.846 --> 00:23:36.683
ooh!

451
00:23:36.683 --> 00:23:38.651
Apologies. Fifi.

452
00:23:38.651 --> 00:23:41.521
I'm always practicing
my grave digging technique.

453
00:23:41.521 --> 00:23:44.624
No worries.
I'm OK.

454
00:23:44.624 --> 00:23:46.593
Let me just try to stand up.

455
00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:48.628
Oh.
Nope.

456
00:23:48.628 --> 00:23:50.830
Not gonna stand up.

457
00:23:58.137 --> 00:24:00.339
Come on. pick up. pick up.

458
00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:04.544
Hey Lincoln.
How's the wedding prep?

459
00:24:04.544 --> 00:24:06.813
Clyde. I'm in the middle
of a spy operation.

460
00:24:06.813 --> 00:24:08.481
and I need your help.
- Roger that.

461
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:10.382
I'll head to HQ.

462
00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:12.151
Sorry. dads.
I've got some important

463
00:24:12.151 --> 00:24:14.487
spy business to attend to.

464
00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:16.523
Just stay hydrated!

465
00:24:16.523 --> 00:24:18.725
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!

466
00:24:24.564 --> 00:24:26.533
Oh.

467
00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.639
<i>Ugh.</i>

468
00:24:32.639 --> 00:24:34.373
Ow.

469
00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:37.810
Whew.

470
00:24:44.383 --> 00:24:46.185
Agent Loud. I'm in.

471
00:24:46.185 --> 00:24:49.288
Clyde. our boat was attacked
after I snapped this photo.

472
00:24:49.288 --> 00:24:51.023
<i>It's in pretty bad shape.</i>

473
00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:52.424
<i>but there might be a clue
in there.</i>

474
00:24:52.424 --> 00:24:54.894
<i>Can you enhance it?
What does the crate say?</i>

475
00:24:57.129 --> 00:24:58.130
Rubiner's.

476
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.198
Give me one second.

477
00:24:59.198 --> 00:25:01.333
All right.
Let's see.

478
00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:03.603
Looks like there's
a restaurant on the island

479
00:25:03.603 --> 00:25:05.705
called Rubiner's Fishmongers.

480
00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:07.373
I'll send you a pin.
- Perfect.

481
00:25:07.373 --> 00:25:09.475
I'll start there.
- Awesome.

482
00:25:09.475 --> 00:25:12.044
Your first real
spy mission with Myrtle.

483
00:25:12.044 --> 00:25:14.581
Uh. Gran-Gran's busy
prepping for the wedding.

484
00:25:14.581 --> 00:25:17.449
so I'm going to take on
this mission solo.

485
00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:18.718
Well. be careful.

486
00:25:18.718 --> 00:25:20.086
And remember to stay hydrated.

487
00:25:33.633 --> 00:25:37.303
Al. whenever you're done
in there. we need to talk.

488
00:25:37.303 --> 00:25:38.605
Okey dokey

489
00:25:38.605 --> 00:25:40.607
You're gonna love
this restaurant. sweetie.

490
00:25:40.607 --> 00:25:42.742
<i>But I already asked
about the napkins.</i>

491
00:25:42.742 --> 00:25:45.945
<i>and they're cloth.
so you can't take them.</i>

492
00:25:45.945 --> 00:25:47.580
Yeah. about that.

493
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.382
I don't think
I'll be making dinner.

494
00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:53.019
I'm just so exhausted
from fishing.

495
00:25:53.019 --> 00:25:55.521
I think I'm gonna lie down.

496
00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:59.659
His little spy butt
is in so much trouble.

497
00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:01.728
Maybe Lynn Sr.
will have dinner with you.

498
00:26:03.362 --> 00:26:05.798
Well. I'm not paying
for Lynn's 12 appetizers.

499
00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:06.999
Yah.

500
00:26:10.202 --> 00:26:12.338
We here at
Thunderball Resort

501
00:26:12.338 --> 00:26:14.406
would like to thank you
for staying with us

502
00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:15.775
on your big day.

503
00:26:15.775 --> 00:26:17.977
Please accept this gift basket
as a token of--

504
00:26:19.378 --> 00:26:22.114
How'd you like to make
the best tip of your life?

505
00:26:30.556 --> 00:26:32.859
Just pretend
to be me taking a nap.

506
00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:34.560
and I'll be back in 20 minutes.

507
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.529
If anyone asks.
your name is Myrtle.

508
00:26:47.807 --> 00:26:49.441
Rest up. honey.

509
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.711
You wouldn't want to miss out
on our cuddle under the stars.

510
00:26:57.349 --> 00:27:00.519
See you soon.
my little Myrtle dove.

511
00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:04.957
OK. well. I guess
that wasn't too bad.

512
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:06.458
Bachelorette party!

513
00:27:07.827 --> 00:27:10.697
Mom--can I call you Mom?
Why are you in bed?

514
00:27:10.697 --> 00:27:12.999
Aren't you excited
for your bachelorette party?

515
00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:14.400
Let's rock. Gran-Gran.

516
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.635
We have a limo
parked out front.

517
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:19.739
Uh. I'm Myrtle?

518
00:27:21.273 --> 00:27:22.909
I'd say that's a yes.

519
00:27:40.326 --> 00:27:45.264
Welcome to Rubiner's.
home of the calamari safari.

520
00:27:49.368 --> 00:27:52.739
Steele. David Steele.
party of one.

521
00:27:52.739 --> 00:27:56.042
Um. this is a restaurant.
not a daycare.

522
00:27:56.042 --> 00:27:57.676
Sorry. kid.

523
00:28:00.112 --> 00:28:02.614
Oh. Juan.

524
00:28:02.614 --> 00:28:06.485
Fine. I guess I'll take
my patronage elsewhere.

525
00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:13.325
Uh. I got a delivery here
from Juan.

526
00:28:13.325 --> 00:28:16.262
Those must be for me.

527
00:28:16.262 --> 00:28:17.663
Next thing you know.
he's gonna propose.

528
00:28:17.663 --> 00:28:19.465
but I'm too young for that.
so I'm gonna say no.

529
00:28:19.465 --> 00:28:20.800
and then we'll wait a year.

530
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.302
and then I'll ask him again
to propose.

531
00:28:23.302 --> 00:28:25.571

We don't serve flippies here.

539
00:28:50.997 --> 00:28:54.266
But we serve floppees.

540

It's me. Fifi.

546
00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:13.219
I ordered the calamari safari.

547
00:29:13.219 --> 00:29:16.055
Come join me
before the clams get hot.

548
00:29:16.055 --> 00:29:18.224
OK. shh.

549
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:26.532
Ta-da!
Huh?

550
00:29:29.368 --> 00:29:31.770
Ugh. you did it again. Randall.

551
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.906
You always push him away.

552
00:29:36.308 --> 00:29:39.745
Go Myrtle.

553
00:29:39.745 --> 00:29:42.548
Your bachelorette party
would not be complete

554
00:29:42.548 --> 00:29:44.383
without some
funky accessories.

555
00:29:44.383 --> 00:29:46.318
Oh.

556
00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:47.753
And some games.

557
00:29:47.753 --> 00:29:51.157
First up.
how well do you know Pop-Pop?

558
00:29:54.193 --> 00:29:55.895
OK. first question.

559
00:29:55.895 --> 00:29:59.331
What's Pop-Pop's
favorite steamed vegetable?

560
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.670
Uh. I'm Myrtle.

561
00:30:05.704 --> 00:30:08.240
Ooh. so close.
It's carrots.

562
00:30:09.976 --> 00:30:11.210
Oh.

563
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.113
This guy
is so not getting a tip.

564
00:30:14.113 --> 00:30:18.350
Ah. these brakes are a doozy.
Everybody all right back here?

565
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.419
Flop?
You're our driver?

566
00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:23.055
The name's Louie. chiefs.

567
00:30:23.055 --> 00:30:25.291
Louie's Limo and Lemonade.

568
00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:26.592
Anybody want some?

569
00:30:26.592 --> 00:30:29.195
I juice the lemons
with my tire jack.

570
00:30:29.195 --> 00:30:30.562
Ugh.

571
00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:32.731
Cut from the same cloth
as our Flip.

572
00:30:32.731 --> 00:30:34.766
Hard pass
on the jacked lemonade.

573
00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:37.469
Yo Louie.
you know any karaoke places?

574
00:30:37.469 --> 00:30:40.706
I think it's time
to sing to the bride to be.

575
00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:42.942
Oh. you betcha.
And right!

576
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.916
Car candles
is my other business.

577
00:30:49.916 --> 00:30:54.186
They're great for road trips
and legal in three states.

00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:55.821
I'm famous for my fragrances.

579

Wet shower. yogurt in a bowl.

580
00:30:59.391 --> 00:31:01.293
and of course. tar.

581
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.598
Save me.

582
00:31:06.598 --> 00:31:07.900
Ugh.

583
00:31:12.471 --> 00:31:15.207
So my cousin's uncle's
brother's great. great aunt--

584
00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:17.009
Oh. man. sorry I'm late.

585
00:31:17.009 --> 00:31:19.979
Jerry wouldn't stop talking
about his cargo shorts.

586
00:31:19.979 --> 00:31:21.981
Huh?

587
00:31:21.981 --> 00:31:24.583
Ugh. Jerry and his pockets.

588
00:31:25.985 --> 00:31:27.954
But my funky foot
fungus fragrance.

589
00:31:27.954 --> 00:31:30.122
that was my best seller.

590
00:31:30.122 --> 00:31:33.025
Excuse me. Fifi.
I have some important business

591
00:31:33.025 --> 00:31:34.360
to attend to.

592
00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:40.366

Yes. sir.

634
00:33:25.704 --> 00:33:29.375
Ham Hand
from Gran-Gran's stories.

<i>Well. we better get moving.</i>

636
00:33:31.077 --> 00:33:34.380
Yeah. last thing I need
is a hammer in the face.

637
00:33:35.581 --> 00:33:39.185
Ow. Ooh. ugh.

638
00:34:00.206 --> 00:34:02.007
Dang it.
Where'd he go?

639
00:34:02.007 --> 00:34:03.242
Ugh!

640
00:34:03.242 --> 00:34:04.943
Lincoln.
what are you doing here?

641
00:34:04.943 --> 00:34:07.313
Oh. phew.
Gran-Gran. it's you.

642
00:34:07.313 --> 00:34:09.148
I told you
to drop the spy stuff.

643
00:34:09.148 --> 00:34:12.584
These people are dangerous.
We need to get out of here now.

644
00:34:12.584 --> 00:34:14.586
Look. I'm sorry
I didn't listen to you.

645
00:34:14.586 --> 00:34:16.522
but Ham Hand is here.
and he said something

646
00:34:16.522 --> 00:34:18.524
about building a rocket
for Dufu.

647
00:34:18.524 --> 00:34:21.560
What?
Doofus is back from space?

648
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.429
Yeah.
And we have to stop him.

649
00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:25.364
No. X is sending
another agent.

650
00:34:25.364 --> 00:34:27.032
and they can stop doofus.

651
00:34:27.032 --> 00:34:30.802
Uh. so don't get mad.
but no one's coming.

652
00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:33.205
- Is that my phone?
- Yeah.

653
00:34:33.205 --> 00:34:36.875
I sort of borrowed it
and accepted the mission.

654
00:34:36.875 --> 00:34:39.278
- What?
- I said don't get mad.

655
00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:41.180
Don't worry.
We got this.

656
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.316
You and I make a great team.

657
00:34:44.316 --> 00:34:46.452
Hey. what are you doing here?

658
00:34:47.786 --> 00:34:50.322
Wait a second.
You're the two from the boat.

659
00:34:50.322 --> 00:34:52.424
David Steele fart spray.

660
00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:55.227
- Nice move. huh?

661
00:34:55.227 --> 00:34:56.262

664
00:35:05.637 --> 00:35:08.807
- Room for dessert?

665
00:35:08.807 --> 00:35:11.377
- Sweet burn. Gran-Gran.
- Come here.

666
00:35:15.581 --> 00:35:18.016
- Gazpacho in your face.
- Gross.

667
00:35:18.016 --> 00:35:22.288
Get over here. kid.
- Ah! Ah!

668
00:35:22.288 --> 00:35:25.624
Ah. ah. ah. ah!

669
00:35:25.624 --> 00:35:29.528
- Ugh!
- Get her!

670
00:35:29.528 --> 00:35:31.463
- Table for three?

671
00:35:31.463 --> 00:35:32.664
Take that booth.

672
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.506
Crab cakes. table ten.

673
00:35:40.506 --> 00:35:43.442
I can't see.
Whoa!

674
00:35:43.442 --> 00:35:46.478
- Gotcha.

675
00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:48.414
Who's hungry for more?

676
00:35:50.516 --> 00:35:52.251
Ah.

677
00:35:57.423 --> 00:35:58.957
That was incredible.

678
00:36:00.426 --> 00:36:02.628
Can we get a quick pic
with all the bodies behind me?

679
00:36:02.628 --> 00:36:04.863
Not now.
We gotta get out of here.

680
00:36:04.863 --> 00:36:06.765
Too late. chump burgers.

681
00:36:06.765 --> 00:36:08.300
- Hiyah!
- Ow!

682
00:36:10.802 --> 00:36:14.072
Excuse us.
- Sorry. Enjoy your meal.

683
00:36:14.072 --> 00:36:15.574
Moped. 12 o'clock.

684
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:21.012
- Go. go. go.
- E-scooter?

685
00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:22.981

689
00:36:32.658 --> 00:36:34.360
Let's go. let's go.

690
00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.662
I'm downloading the app.

691
00:36:36.662 --> 00:36:39.064
Ah!

692
00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:44.603
- Whoa!

693
00:36:44.603 --> 00:36:46.738
Do you think
they'll figure out the app?

694
00:36:46.738 --> 00:36:49.808
I figured out the app.
Let's roll.

695

696
00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:06.525

ditch these punks.

697
00:37:11.497 --> 00:37:14.366
Huh?

698
00:37:19.271 --> 00:37:20.406
Whoa.

699
00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:37.756
Are they blasting at us?

700
00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:40.659
Well. they're sure not
blowing us kisses.

701
00:37:43.295 --> 00:37:45.030
Tranquilizer darts?

702
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:48.166
Don't worry. Gran-Gran.
I'll take care of this guy.

703
00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:50.636
I've got it. Lincoln.
Just give me your phone.

704
00:37:50.636 --> 00:37:53.472
Ugh.
Yeah. great idea.

705
00:37:53.472 --> 00:37:56.708
You can use my David Steele
distraction light.

706
00:37:57.809 --> 00:38:00.346
Hey.

707
00:38:07.353 --> 00:38:09.220

708
00:38:16.395 --> 00:38:17.763
Huh?

709
00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:22.300
Whoa. that was amazing.

710
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.836
We messed
those dudes up. Gran-Gran.

711
00:38:24.836 --> 00:38:26.638
We sure did.

712
00:38:28.907 --> 00:38:30.909
- Ah!
- Whoa!

713
00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:33.044
Ow.
- Ooh.

714
00:38:36.448 --> 00:38:38.249
Lincoln.

715
00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:40.586
Ow.
Huh?

716
00:38:40.586 --> 00:38:42.253
You've got
to get out of here.

717
00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:44.022
But Gran-Gran--

718
00:38:44.022 --> 00:38:46.792
Listen to me. you need
to get Pop-Pop and your family

719
00:38:46.792 --> 00:38:49.094
off the island.
I'll be fine.

720
00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:51.363
Now go.

721
00:39:03.442 --> 00:39:06.244
Oh. come on.
All my pictures were on there.

722
00:39:06.244 --> 00:39:11.417
Agent 28. we meet again.

723
00:39:11.417 --> 00:39:13.519
Hammy. long time no see.

724
00:39:13.519 --> 00:39:15.253
Did your hair get thinner?

725
00:39:15.253 --> 00:39:18.189
Get the jokes in now.

726
00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:21.359
Dufu got you front row tickets
for our main event.

727
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:24.963
and then I'm gonna put
an end to this little reunion.

728
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.001
Tie her up.

729
00:39:30.001 --> 00:39:32.404
Sweep the area
for the wannabe spy.

730
00:39:38.844 --> 00:39:41.312
Where is this kid?

731
00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:44.850
Oh. no.
So not good. So not good.

732
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.585
Hey. I hear some panicking.

733
00:39:46.585 --> 00:39:48.386
Over here.
- Ugh!

734
00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:50.789
You check over there.
I'll check over here.

735
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.860
What do I do?
What would David Steele do?

736
00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.662
Think. think. think.

737
00:40:00.432 --> 00:40:02.668
Just got to take this
one step at time.

738
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.879
Ow.

739
00:40:14.846 --> 00:40:16.882
Ow.

740
00:40:19.017 --> 00:40:20.886
They found me.

741
00:40:27.025 --> 00:40:28.627
Lincoln. we can see you.

742
00:40:28.627 --> 00:40:30.195
Yeah. and you look terrible.

743
00:40:30.195 --> 00:40:31.663
What are you doing out here?

744
00:40:31.663 --> 00:40:34.399
Are you playing spy again?

745
00:40:34.399 --> 00:40:37.569
Lori? Lola?
Am I glad to see you guys.

746
00:40:37.569 --> 00:40:39.905
There's an evil doctor
trying to take over the world.

747
00:40:39.905 --> 00:40:41.873
and his goons
captured Gran-Gran.

748
00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:45.343
What are you talking about?

749
00:40:45.343 --> 00:40:47.813
Myrtle is literally
in the limo with us.

750
00:40:47.813 --> 00:40:49.147
Huh?

751
00:40:52.618 --> 00:40:53.952
Go Myrtle.

752
00:40:53.952 --> 00:40:57.656
Go Myrtle. go Myrtle.
- Gran-Gran? You escaped.

753
00:40:57.656 --> 00:40:59.991
Are you catching everyone up
on our wild night?

754
00:40:59.991 --> 00:41:03.662
What's the plan?
- Um. I'm Myrtle.

755
00:41:05.697 --> 00:41:08.500
- Huh?

756
00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:11.670
- Imposter.

757
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:13.104
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

758
00:41:13.104 --> 00:41:15.306
Look. Myrtle promised me
a big tip

759
00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:18.376
if I pretended to be her. so...

760
00:41:18.376 --> 00:41:20.145
You're telling me
we've been buying drinks

761
00:41:20.145 --> 00:41:22.581
all night for some rando?

762
00:41:22.581 --> 00:41:24.783
I would have said
something earlier.

763
00:41:24.783 --> 00:41:27.385
but I just got caught up
in being Myrtle.

764
00:41:27.385 --> 00:41:29.655
It was so freeing.

765
00:41:29.655 --> 00:41:31.089
I just got to say.

766
00:41:31.089 --> 00:41:34.926
you're the most supportive
family I've ever met.

767
00:41:37.996 --> 00:41:41.099
So Lincoln's
ridiculous story is true?

768
00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:43.201
Lori. call Pop-Pop
and your father stat.

769
00:41:43.201 --> 00:41:45.470
Mom. nobody makes
phone calls anymore.

770
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.807
It's all about the emojis.
- Just call them!

771
00:41:50.075 --> 00:41:52.077
Flop. Louie.
whatever your name is.

772
00:41:52.077 --> 00:41:53.845
take us to
the island police station

773
00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:55.581
and step on it.
- OK.

774
00:41:55.581 --> 00:41:57.816
But if anyone yacks
on the upholstery.

775
00:41:57.816 --> 00:42:00.786
I got to charge
a $50 upchuck fee.

776
00:42:02.654 --> 00:42:05.691
Oop. that one was me.

777
00:42:05.691 --> 00:42:08.093
<i>But I'm still charging you.</i>

778
00:42:13.832 --> 00:42:16.668
We need to see
the chief ASAP.

779
00:42:17.903 --> 00:42:20.138
You got him.

780
00:42:20.138 --> 00:42:23.541
Chief Phillipini.
nice to meet youse.

781
00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:26.612
How is he
in so many places at once?

782
00:42:26.612 --> 00:42:28.213
That's not important.

783
00:42:28.213 --> 00:42:29.781
My Myrtle was taken.
and we need you

784
00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:31.883
to get her back chop-chop.

785
00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:33.919
Oh. yeesh.
That is a pickle.

786
00:42:33.919 --> 00:42:36.487
But I got to wait
48 hours before filing

787
00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.123
a missing persons report.

788
00:42:38.123 --> 00:42:40.458
Hey. if you're looking
to kill a little time.

789
00:42:40.458 --> 00:42:42.828
Ceviche and are doing
two nights of improv

790
00:42:42.828 --> 00:42:44.429
at the Chuckle Condo.

791
00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:47.198
Just make sure to lock up
on your way out.

792
00:42:47.198 --> 00:42:50.836
There's a whole lot
of evidence in here.

793
00:42:50.836 --> 00:42:54.539
Oh. I can't believe
I wasn't there to help her.

794
00:42:54.539 --> 00:42:56.775
What kind of fiancé am I?

795
00:42:56.775 --> 00:42:58.944
What are we gonna do?

796
00:42:58.944 --> 00:43:00.712
I know exactly
what we have to do.

797
00:43:00.712 --> 00:43:01.813
Huh?

798
00:43:01.813 --> 00:43:04.115
We form an elite spy team

799
00:43:04.115 --> 00:43:06.217
and go into the jungle
to save her.

800
00:43:06.217 --> 00:43:08.419
That's what David Steele
would do.

801
00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:11.256
Lincoln. we are
so not secret agents.

802
00:43:11.256 --> 00:43:13.024
Yeah. Lori can't even catch.

803
00:43:13.024 --> 00:43:15.861
- Ow. Lynn!
- See?

804
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:17.629
No. but I am.

805
00:43:17.629 --> 00:43:19.230
and I can lead the way.

806
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.599
Besides. we're in
the middle of the ocean.

807
00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:24.636
Nobody's coming.
and we're running out of time.

808
00:43:24.636 --> 00:43:27.105
Who's with me?

809
00:43:28.907 --> 00:43:30.942
- I am.
- Huh?

810
00:43:30.942 --> 00:43:33.211
Lincoln's right.

811
00:43:33.211 --> 00:43:36.014
It's us or no one.
I'm in.

812
00:43:38.083 --> 00:43:39.718
That's a cute idea. guys.

813
00:43:39.718 --> 00:43:43.188
But how are we supposed to
take down an army of henchmen?

814
00:43:43.188 --> 00:43:46.224
Easy. we just need
the right equipment.

815
00:43:50.228 --> 00:43:54.232
Meet me at the hotel
business center in the morning.

816
00:43:56.234 --> 00:43:59.304
Welcome to my makeshift lab.

817
00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:00.939
It's been tough
without the proper facilities.

818
00:44:00.939 --> 00:44:02.874
but we're making do.

819
00:44:02.874 --> 00:44:05.711
Todd. initiate Protocol Steele.

820
00:44:05.711 --> 00:44:07.545
Affirmative. y'all.

821
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.919
Ooh.

822
00:44:13.919 --> 00:44:17.422
Is that "David Steele"
issue 479?

823
00:44:17.422 --> 00:44:19.024
Keen observation. brother.

824
00:44:19.024 --> 00:44:20.726
Taking a page from this comic.

825
00:44:20.726 --> 00:44:22.861
I've whipped up
a few devices that should aid

826
00:44:22.861 --> 00:44:25.764
in the kicking of some serious
villain posterior.

827
00:44:25.764 --> 00:44:28.533
street name. butts.

828
00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:30.802
For Leni.
lightning lemonade lipstick

829
00:44:30.802 --> 00:44:33.772
capable of cutting
any and all types of material.

830
00:44:33.772 --> 00:44:35.573
Ooh. a spring shade.

831
00:44:35.573 --> 00:44:38.176
For you. Lily.
this special lollipop.

832
00:44:38.176 --> 00:44:39.745
One lick.
and an elephant

833
00:44:39.745 --> 00:44:41.279
will be sleeping for hours.

834
00:44:43.148 --> 00:44:45.483
For Lori.
a pitching wedge grappling hook

835
00:44:45.483 --> 00:44:48.153
capable of holding
10.000 pounds.

836
00:44:48.153 --> 00:44:51.056
What's this button do?

837
00:44:51.056 --> 00:44:52.357
And for the flower girl.

838
00:44:52.357 --> 00:44:54.592
delicate
and destructive daffodils.

839
00:44:56.995 --> 00:44:58.930
For Luan. a whoopee cushion
filled with Lynn's

840
00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:02.600
post-meatball flatulence.
- Deadly. Wait. how did you--

841
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.669
Hydraulic knuckles
for Pop-Pop.

842
00:45:04.669 --> 00:45:06.271
That's the stuff.

843
00:45:06.271 --> 00:45:08.573
And Lincoln. for you.
your David Steele watch

844
00:45:08.573 --> 00:45:10.842
has now been reinforced
with stainless steel

845
00:45:10.842 --> 00:45:12.911
and bulletproof carbon
as well as equipped

846
00:45:12.911 --> 00:45:14.712
with a built in super magnet.

847
00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:17.983
It's only got enough charge
for one use. so use it wisely.

848
00:45:17.983 --> 00:45:20.351
Ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh.
what's my device. Lisa?

849
00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:23.721
What's my device. huh?
- Glad you asked. Father.

850
00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:26.424
Whoa. pepper shakers.

851
00:45:26.424 --> 00:45:28.293
Do they talk? Explode?
Oh. I bet they're heat-seeking.

852
00:45:28.293 --> 00:45:29.861
Ah!

853
00:45:31.362 --> 00:45:33.765
- Uh. Lisa.

854
00:45:33.765 --> 00:45:36.067
Don't worry.
They're just electric.

855
00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:37.368
I don't want him
hurting anyone.

856
00:45:37.368 --> 00:45:40.538
including himself.

857
00:45:40.538 --> 00:45:42.808
Dr. Dufu
won't know what hit him.

858
00:45:42.808 --> 00:45:45.543
Let's go save Gran-Gran!

859
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:53.718
In you go.

860
00:45:55.086 --> 00:45:57.288
No. no. no.
this is all wrong.

861
00:45:57.288 --> 00:46:00.225
I requested a suite
with a king-size bed.

862
00:46:00.225 --> 00:46:01.827
Keep joking. 28.

863
00:46:01.827 --> 00:46:04.930
Dufu will get the last laugh.

864
00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:07.298
Like he isn't already
laughing at that caterpillar

865
00:46:07.298 --> 00:46:09.000
under your nose.

866
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.370
- It's a timeless look. OK?
- Don't listen to her.

867
00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.806
I think it's cute.
- Thanks. Rick.

868
00:46:14.806 --> 00:46:17.508
You always know what to say.

869
00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:19.477
Ugh.

870
00:46:19.477 --> 00:46:23.281
Oh. Myrtle. you just can't
escape this life. can you?

871
00:46:35.193 --> 00:46:36.527
Come on. guys.

872
00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:38.063
I'm pretty sure
these tire tracks

873
00:46:38.063 --> 00:46:39.664
will lead us
right to Gran-Gran.

874
00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:47.005
Wait.
The tracks just end here.

875
00:46:47.005 --> 00:46:48.907
Oh. well that's just great.

876
00:46:48.907 --> 00:46:51.609
We came all this way.
and now we're lost. Lincoln.

877
00:46:53.044 --> 00:46:55.613
Lip balm.
mothballs. and a hint

878
00:46:55.613 --> 00:46:58.216
of those hard caramels
from the gas station.

879
00:46:58.216 --> 00:47:00.551
That's Myrtle.
She was here.

880
00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:03.421
Come on. girl.
what do you smell?

881
00:47:03.421 --> 00:47:05.991
- She's got the scent.

882
00:47:09.294 --> 00:47:12.697
Huh.
The scent goes cold here.

883
00:47:14.432 --> 00:47:16.167
That's it.

884
00:47:16.167 --> 00:47:17.903
That's where
they have Gran-Gran.

885
00:47:17.903 --> 00:47:19.504
In "David Steele" issue 10.

886
00:47:19.504 --> 00:47:21.539
Malice captured
David Steele's nephew

887
00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:23.441
and held him hostage
in a mountain lair.

888
00:47:23.441 --> 00:47:25.676
We just need to find a way in.

889
00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:28.346
Hey. maybe those guys
can help us.

890
00:47:30.015 --> 00:47:31.649
Get down.

891
00:47:34.385 --> 00:47:36.988
Howdy. Loudies!

892
00:47:38.723 --> 00:47:41.392
Rented a buggy
from the resort.

893
00:47:43.228 --> 00:47:44.762
Did you hear something?

894
00:47:44.762 --> 00:47:47.698
Fifi. please stop.

895
00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:50.435
Hey. it's that nosy
white haired kid from the boat.

896
00:47:50.435 --> 00:47:53.338
Get him.
- Quick. follow me.

897
00:47:53.338 --> 00:47:55.006
This thing really moves.

898
00:47:55.006 --> 00:47:57.342
Sorry.
we're commandeering this.

899
00:47:57.342 --> 00:48:00.678
Hold on to your butts.

900
00:48:01.913 --> 00:48:03.314
See you soon.

901
00:48:06.784 --> 00:48:08.319
Go. go. go.

902
00:48:15.426 --> 00:48:17.395
Did we lose them?

903
00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:20.331
Coast is clear. Mom.

904
00:48:23.168 --> 00:48:25.303
[together
Whoa!

905
00:48:30.976 --> 00:48:32.377
Cliff approaching.

906
00:48:33.378 --> 00:48:34.912
Hang on. kids.

907
00:48:42.153 --> 00:48:44.555
More bad guys!

908
00:48:48.393 --> 00:48:50.361
Ugh. so dramatic.

909
00:48:50.361 --> 00:48:52.763
I'll handle this.

910
00:49:06.111 --> 00:49:07.745
Huh?

911
00:49:20.091 --> 00:49:22.493
- Ah!
- Mom. look out!

912
00:49:35.006 --> 00:49:36.374
Hmm?

913
00:49:36.374 --> 00:49:37.742
Huh?

914
00:49:40.378 --> 00:49:41.946
Where are we?

915
00:49:41.946 --> 00:49:44.582
This must be the entrance
to Dr. Dufu's secret lair.

916
00:49:44.582 --> 00:49:46.317
Let's go take it to him.

917
00:49:46.317 --> 00:49:48.053
Not so fast. Pop-Pop.

918
00:49:48.053 --> 00:49:51.422
Villain 101. any evil lair
is gonna be heavily guarded.

919
00:49:51.422 --> 00:49:53.358
If we're gonna
breach this place.

920
00:49:53.358 --> 00:49:56.827
we got to do it spy style.

921
00:50:03.768 --> 00:50:05.570
- Huh?

922
00:50:07.438 --> 00:50:10.007
Uh. hello. baby.

923
00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:11.242
Are you lost?

924
00:50:13.111 --> 00:50:14.945
Oh. thanks. but no thanks.

925
00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:17.982
I'm trying
to cut back on my sweets.

926
00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.619
No. wait. don't cry.

927
00:50:21.619 --> 00:50:25.290
Look.
See?

928
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:27.425
Oh. is that cinna--

929
00:50:27.425 --> 00:50:29.327
Night-night.

930
00:50:29.327 --> 00:50:31.262
Nice work. Lily.

931
00:50:31.262 --> 00:50:32.730
Thank you.

932
00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:34.732
<i>Attention all security staff.</i>

933
00:50:34.732 --> 00:50:36.267
<i>We have ten minutes
until the big launch.</i>

934
00:50:37.735 --> 00:50:39.437
<i>Also today
is Tony's birthday.</i>

935
00:50:39.437 --> 00:50:42.240
<i>so don't forget to sign
his card in the break room.</i>

936
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.409
Guys. we got get
Gran-Gran quick.

937
00:50:44.409 --> 00:50:45.643
Come on.

938
00:50:50.548 --> 00:50:53.851
Look.
A directory.

939
00:50:53.851 --> 00:50:55.586
Let's see.

940
00:50:55.586 --> 00:50:58.723
Aha. there's a jail cell
on the 10th floor.

941
00:50:58.723 --> 00:51:00.525
That's where
they'll be keeping Gran-Gran.

942
00:51:00.525 --> 00:51:02.593
It's jailbreak time. baby.

943
00:51:02.593 --> 00:51:04.061
Be careful.

944
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:06.664
These places are usually
riddled with booby traps.

945
00:51:06.664 --> 00:51:08.599
One wrong step and you--
- Uh. Lincoln.

946
00:51:10.235 --> 00:51:11.469
Dang it.

947
00:51:12.737 --> 00:51:16.141
- Whoa!
- Oh!

948
00:51:16.141 --> 00:51:17.608
That was close.

949
00:51:17.608 --> 00:51:19.444
Hey. what gives?

950
00:51:19.444 --> 00:51:21.312
<i>- Are you guys OK?</i>
- We're fine.

951
00:51:21.312 --> 00:51:22.547
We all know where to go.

952
00:51:22.547 --> 00:51:24.081
Let's meet up at the jail cell.

953
00:51:27.618 --> 00:51:31.289
T-minus ten minutes
until launch.

954
00:51:31.289 --> 00:51:33.057
Think. Myrtle. think.

955
00:51:33.057 --> 00:51:35.993
You can't let doofus
fire that rocket.

956
00:51:39.964 --> 00:51:41.499
Free napkins.

957
00:51:41.499 --> 00:51:44.535
Never know
when they'll save your life.

958
00:51:48.139 --> 00:51:49.874
Ah. that's our way up.

959
00:51:49.874 --> 00:51:51.509
But how do we get
those guys out of here?

960
00:52:02.653 --> 00:52:05.723
Hmm.
We work in a nice place.

961
00:52:05.723 --> 00:52:08.793
- I got this one.
- Huh?

962
00:52:11.229 --> 00:52:14.232
Sorry to butt in. Tony.

963
00:52:14.232 --> 00:52:18.569
Hmm. anyone here
wear a men's extra large?

964
00:52:18.569 --> 00:52:21.906
I'm more of a snug medium.

965
00:52:21.906 --> 00:52:23.708
Stop it.

966
00:52:23.708 --> 00:52:25.876
Hey. hey. fellas.

967
00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:28.679
You henching hard
or hardly henching?

968
00:52:28.679 --> 00:52:30.281
Hey. it's Tony.

969
00:52:30.281 --> 00:52:31.516
Happy birthday. man.

970
00:52:31.516 --> 00:52:33.918
Oh. thanks.
You too.

971
00:52:33.918 --> 00:52:36.754
Hey. wait.
my birthday is next Tuesday.

972
00:52:36.754 --> 00:52:39.257
and the real Tony
would know that.

973
00:52:39.257 --> 00:52:41.759
Uh. I didn't want
to have to do this.

974
00:52:41.759 --> 00:52:43.728
but you left me no choice.

975
00:52:50.201 --> 00:52:51.636
- Ah. ah...
- Yah...

976
00:52:55.273 --> 00:52:56.641
Huzzah!

977
00:52:57.875 --> 00:53:00.378
It's OK. kids.
Daddy saved us all.

978
00:53:00.378 --> 00:53:03.914
Hiyah!

979
00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:06.484
All right. just a straight shot
to the top.

980
00:53:08.453 --> 00:53:10.221
Whoa. wait.
why are we stopping?

981
00:53:10.221 --> 00:53:12.490
I have an idea.

982
00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:13.624
Whoa!

983
00:53:17.428 --> 00:53:19.897
Hey. Tony.

984
00:53:19.897 --> 00:53:21.999
Someone's been really
putting away the birthday cake.

985
00:53:21.999 --> 00:53:24.635
Yeah. well. you know me.

986
00:53:24.635 --> 00:53:27.405
Tony can't help himself.

987
00:53:35.746 --> 00:53:39.016
How are we gonna cross
without them seeing us?

988
00:53:42.987 --> 00:53:44.589
We need to cut the lights.

989
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:46.090
On it.

990
00:53:52.297 --> 00:53:53.431
- Huh?
- What?

991
00:53:58.936 --> 00:54:01.205
Stay close.
I have natural night vision.

992
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.709

out of my face.

993
00:54:04.709 --> 00:54:06.844

Oxygen levels waning.

995
00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.382
Need air.

996
00:54:13.651 --> 00:54:15.320
Huh?

997
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.622
You know.

Time for your nap. grandma.

1067
00:59:07.778 --> 00:59:09.446
Ham Hand. heads up.

1068
00:59:09.446 --> 00:59:11.181
Huh?

1069
00:59:14.885 --> 00:59:17.554
Looks like
you've got a clog. Hammy.

1070
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.936
Al? Kids!

1071
00:59:31.936 --> 00:59:33.403
Gran-Gran.

1072
00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:34.905
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

1073
00:59:34.905 --> 00:59:36.440
Don't you worry.

1074
00:59:39.243 --> 00:59:41.145
Gran-Gran.
look out behind you.

1075
00:59:41.145 --> 00:59:44.048
- Huh?

1076
00:59:45.683 --> 00:59:46.917
Huh?

1077
00:59:49.754 --> 00:59:51.822
There you are. doofus.

1078
00:59:51.822 --> 00:59:55.760
It's pronounced Dufu.

1079
00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.727
Fifi?

1080
00:59:56.727 --> 00:59:57.995
Huh?

1081
00:59:57.995 --> 01:00:01.065
You don't remember me.
Agent 28?

1082
01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:03.333
Because I remember you.

1083
01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.569
The day you ruined my life

1084
01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:09.239
will be etched
in my mind forever.

1085
01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:11.375
Good news. Roofy Floofy.

1086
01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:13.177
there was a hair
in the mashed potatoes.

1087
01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:16.313
so we got our sides for free.

1088
01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:18.615
I love mashed potatoes.

1089
01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:21.051
Rufus?

1090
01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:27.992
- No!
- Rufus!

1091
01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:36.433
Well. that's a shame.

1092
01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:38.969
But at least
he got a room with a view.

1093
01:00:42.106 --> 01:00:45.609
You're Schmoofy Doofy.

1094
01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:47.611
Very good. 28.

1095
01:00:47.611 --> 01:00:50.447
I stopped your husband
from taking over the world.

1096
01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:53.751
and I'll stop you too.

1097
01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:56.620
I never planned
to take over the world.

1098
01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.790
That was all
just a ruse to get you here.

1099
01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:01.926
This is personal.

1100
01:01:01.926 --> 01:01:06.596
Roofy Floofy and I had
our whole future ahead of us.

1101
01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.899
And you snatched
that dream from me

1102
01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:10.534
by shooting him into space.

1103
01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:12.937
I didn't throw
your husband into that rocket.

1104
01:01:12.937 --> 01:01:15.639
He tripped and fell.
- Silence.

1105
01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:17.742
This is my monologue.

1106
01:01:17.742 --> 01:01:21.278
I've been waiting years
to exact my revenge.

1107
01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:23.814
and when I saw your
little wedding announcement

1108
01:01:23.814 --> 01:01:28.652
in the "Royal Woods Gazette."
I was elated.

1109
01:01:28.652 --> 01:01:31.688
I've been studying you all
for months now.

1110
01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:34.024
I know who's a genius.

1111
01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:36.660
I know who's creepy.

1112
01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:40.064
I even know
who's prone to flatulence.

1113
01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:41.531
Is it me?

1114
01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.700
'Cause this one's a toss-up
between Lori and I.

1115
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.869
Stop it. Lynn.

1116
01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:46.971
But I needed a way
to get close.

1117
01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:50.741
and I found it with you.
Lincoln.

1118
01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:54.078
A wittle boy playing spy.

1119
01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:57.815
I knew if I could lure you
into my spy game.

1120
01:01:57.815 --> 01:02:00.250
you wouldn't be able to resist.

1121
01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:01.752
Wait a sec.

1122
01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:05.622
You mean. the boat.
the restaurant. the dune buggy?

1123
01:02:05.622 --> 01:02:08.258
It was all a setup.

1124
01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:10.761
I can't believe
I fell for it.

1125
01:02:10.761 --> 01:02:12.096
I can.

1126
01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:14.264
You're just
an irresponsible child.

1127
01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:16.333
I mean.
you couldn't even take care

1128
01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:18.602
of a couple wedding rings.

1129
01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:25.075
You've led your loved ones
right into my trap.

1130
01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:28.545
<i>Rocket armed.</i>

1131
01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:31.448
You took away my family.
Agent 28.

1132
01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:34.885
and now
I'm gonna take away yours.

1133
01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:37.321
By launching them into space!

1134
01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:46.196
<i>T-minus one minute
until launch.</i>

1135
01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:49.967
<i>59. 58. 57...</i>

1136
01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:52.469
Au revoir. Louds.

1137
01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:57.507
You're not going anywhere.

1138
01:02:57.507 --> 01:03:00.677
So just sit back
and enjoy the show.

1139
01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:07.284
Hey Hammy.
your bald spot's showing.

1140
01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:11.221
What?
But wait. I combed over it.

1141
01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:13.824
Hey.

1142
01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:16.293
Whoa!

1143
01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:32.476
Now. where were we?

1144
01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:34.811
Time for your nap.

1145
01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:36.380
Huh?

1146
01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:39.950
Hold tight. kids.

1147
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:43.854
If I can get doofus's phone.
I can stop the rocket.

1148
01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:56.500
I guess
you won't be needing these

1149
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.169
since I'll be shooting
your fiancé into space.

1150
01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:06.376
No!

1151
01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:09.213
Oh. that felt good.
Boop.

1152
01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:13.083
Toodles.
Enjoy the show.

1153
01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:20.257
Too slow. doofus.

1154
01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:24.995
No. no. no. no. no. no. no!

1155
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:29.766
<i>30 seconds until launch.</i>

1156
01:04:29.766 --> 01:04:31.068
Ow.

1157
01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:41.912
Gotcha.

1158
01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:46.383
I need that phone. Fifi.

1159
01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:49.286
Never.
I must have my revenge.

1160
01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:51.255
We don't have time for this.

1161
01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:53.423
Give me the phone.
and I'll pull you up.

1162
01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:58.162
Come on. you're gonna fall.

1163
01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:04.201
- No!

1164
01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:08.872
<i>Three. two. one.</i>

1165
01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:43.373
OK. everybody.
we need to conserve oxygen.

1166
01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:46.376
Forget that.
Suck it down.

1167
01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:49.846
Oh. what's the point?

1168
01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:52.882
I'm never gonna see
my Myrtle again.

1169
01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:56.320
Myrtle!

1170
01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.191
Oh. thank you.

1171
01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:04.194
We're saved.
You brought parachutes. right?

1172
01:06:06.263 --> 01:06:09.399
I'm sorry. Lynn.
I've got nothing.

1173
01:06:09.399 --> 01:06:12.102
I don't know
if there's a way back down.

1174
01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:15.705
This is all my fault.

1175
01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.074
Lincoln.

1176
01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:19.743
No. Fifi was right.

1177
01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:22.412
I'm just a dumb kid
playing spy.

1178
01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:25.449
I couldn't even keep track
of your rings.

1179
01:06:25.449 --> 01:06:28.852
I ruined the wedding
and our lives.

1180
01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:31.388
and now we're stuck up here
forever because of me.

1181
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:54.644
Maybe not.

1182
01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:56.580
Once I was on a mission
in Minsk

1183
01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:57.847
and had to escape
through the toilet

1184
01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.450
on a Trans-Siberian rail car.

1185
01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:05.455
Yah!

1186
01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:08.392
Whoa.
She just dead lifted the john.

1187
01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:12.129
We can use the septic tank
as an escape pod.

1188
01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:15.299
We are still
in the troposphere.

1189
01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:18.568
If we can seal off the tank.
we just may survive impact.

1190
01:07:20.204 --> 01:07:22.406
There is. however. one problem.

1191
01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:26.576
Someone is gonna have to close
the tank from the outside.

1192
01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.044
You mean--

1193
01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.114
One of us
isn't getting off this rocket.

1194
01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.085
I'll do it.

1195
01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:36.353
What?

1196
01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:39.123
- I got us into this mess.
- Absolutely not.

1197
01:07:39.123 --> 01:07:40.924
You're all family.

1198
01:07:40.924 --> 01:07:42.692
I'll stay behind.

1199
01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:46.796
Myrtle. you're part
of this family too.

1200
01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.998
No.

1201
01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:53.470
I'm not. Al.
I can't marry you.

1202
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:54.604
Huh?

1203
01:07:54.604 --> 01:07:57.541
I love you. Al.
I love you all.

1204
01:07:57.541 --> 01:07:59.676
But it's like I told Lincoln.

1205
01:07:59.676 --> 01:08:02.312
The spy life has consequences.

1206
01:08:02.312 --> 01:08:04.148
I thought
I could escape my past.

1207
01:08:04.148 --> 01:08:06.082
but it'll always be there.

1208
01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.885
putting anyone I care about
at risk.

1209
01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:11.488
Uh. I don't want
to come off as insensitive.

1210
01:08:11.488 --> 01:08:14.424
but we've got to get
this show on the road.

1211
01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.695
Go.

1212
01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:30.039
Whoa.
Oh!

1213
01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:37.481
I can't do this.

1214
01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:40.083
I don't want to live
a life without you.

1215
01:08:40.083 --> 01:08:41.718
Oh. my Al.

1216
01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:44.554
A gentleman till the end.

1217
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:48.525
I'm so sorry.

1218
01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:56.400
Lincoln!

1219
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.068
- Whoa!
- Ah!

1220
01:09:02.172 --> 01:09:04.308
Goodbye. everyone.

1221
01:09:04.308 --> 01:09:06.543
No!

1222
01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:27.697
Ham Hand is invincible.

1223
01:09:31.535 --> 01:09:33.337
Call the Air Force.
Radio NASA.

1224
01:09:33.337 --> 01:09:36.506
Does anyone know an astronaut?

1225
01:09:58.094 --> 01:09:59.596
Huh?

1226
01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:04.768
Rita. Lynn. kids.
I have an idea.

1227
01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:07.837
We just need to get back
to the rocket console.

1228
01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:11.741
Five layers of love.

1229
01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:14.411
Yummy. dum. dum.

1230
01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.915
We've established
a connection with my laser.

1231
01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:21.050
but I only see
one viable satellite

1232
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.886
that can course correct
the rocket.

1233
01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:26.323
It's moving fast.
so we've only got one shot.

1234
01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.061
Aha. right there.

1235
01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.764
It's the satellite.
Deploying laser.

1236
01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.735
Yah!

1237
01:10:41.204 --> 01:10:45.241
Behold the power of science.

1238
01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:55.352
Huh?

1239
01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:00.824
Impact successful.

1240
01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:07.797
Look. there he is!

1241
01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:16.406
Lincoln!

1242
01:11:28.452 --> 01:11:30.253
That's my best man.

1243
01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:32.489
I'm coming. little buddy.

1244
01:11:55.211 --> 01:11:57.213
Ha!

1245
01:11:59.182 --> 01:12:02.285
I should have brought
more coffins.

1246
01:12:02.285 --> 01:12:04.454
Ow.

1247
01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:11.628
How could that man ever think
he's small potatoes?

1248
01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:16.032
He's the biggest potato I know.

1249
01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:21.871
You-- you-- you--

1250
01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:24.674
Lori. think fast.

1251
01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:25.842
Thanks. Lana.

1252
01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:28.111
Pop-Pop. you saved me.

1253
01:12:28.111 --> 01:12:30.680
Aw. it was mostly Myrtle.

1254
01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.982
It was her plan
to use my laser.

1255
01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:35.652
I couldn't have done it
without David Steele

1256
01:12:35.652 --> 01:12:37.787
and all of you.

1257
01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:43.427
No one in this family
goes at it alone. big brother.

1258
01:12:48.532 --> 01:12:50.567
Come on. Gran-Gran.

1259
01:12:50.567 --> 01:12:51.968
Get in here.

1260
01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:55.304
Really?
Even after all of this?

1261
01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:56.506
You heard Lisa.

1262
01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:59.108
This family
always sticks together.

1263
01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:02.779
even if a super villain and her
army of henchmen are after us.

1264
01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:10.854
Maybe I can have a family.

1265
01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:12.656
Does that mean--

1266
01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:17.326
Let's get married. Al.

1267
01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.795
- Yes!
- Yay!

1268
01:13:25.535 --> 01:13:27.671
Uh. knock. knock.

1269
01:13:27.671 --> 01:13:31.007
You wanted to see me?
Ooh. Ah.

1270
01:13:31.007 --> 01:13:33.376
I'm not looking.
I promise.

1271
01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:35.612
Lincoln.
that wedding superstition

1272
01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:37.714
only applies to the groom.

1273
01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:40.249
I just want to say.
you were brave

1274
01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.819
to step up
for your family like that.

1275
01:13:42.819 --> 01:13:46.556
I'm so proud
I get to be your Gran-Gran.

1276
01:13:48.792 --> 01:13:50.594
Oh. I almost forgot.

1277
01:13:50.594 --> 01:13:52.061
These are for you.

1278
01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:54.197
I'm sorry they're not
the original rings.

1279
01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:56.332
They're made out of bamboo.

1280
01:13:56.332 --> 01:13:58.635
Oh. thank you.

1281
01:13:58.635 --> 01:14:01.004
These are beautiful.

1282
01:14:01.004 --> 01:14:03.106
Where'd you get them?

1283
01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:05.374
You'd be amazed
what a David Steele watch

1284
01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:06.776
is worth on this island.

1285
01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:10.179
But Lincoln.
it's a collectible.

1286
01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:12.115
I know. but someone
once told me

1287
01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:14.317
that there's more to spy life
than fancy gadgets.

1288
01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:17.253
and I think I'm starting
to understand what they meant.

1289
01:14:17.253 --> 01:14:18.788
Come here.

1290
01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:23.026
Just don't go jumping into
any rockets again without me.

1291
01:14:25.228 --> 01:14:28.598
And now I.
Willie of Willie's Weddings

1292
01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:31.434
and Wakes. pronounce you. Al.

1293
01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:34.070
and you. Myrtle. married.

1294
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:36.139
Psst. the rings.

1295
01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.409
I knew we could count on you.

1296
01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:50.920
I love you. Myrtle dove.

1297
01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.022
Oh. Al.

1298
01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:57.093
Come on. Gran-Gran!

1299
01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:01.531
It's bouquet time. baby.

1300
01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:03.867
Here. use this shrimp
as a mouth guard.

1301
01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:06.269
It could get ugly out there.

1302
01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:10.106
Use your body. Lori.

1303
01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:13.977
Out of the way.
Yes!

1304
01:15:13.977 --> 01:15:16.045
I got it.

1305
01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:18.782
X. you came.

1306
01:15:18.782 --> 01:15:20.750
Uh. who's X?

1307
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:22.118
My boss.

1308
01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:24.854
Nice catch. blondie.

1309
01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.422
but if you ever
tackle me again.

1310
01:15:26.422 --> 01:15:29.158
I'll make Bobby Boo Boo Bear
disappear

1311
01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:31.961
and have it look
like an accident.

Me and Ceviche were out
diving for buried treasure

1323
01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:14.638
when we found these two clowns.

1324
01:16:14.638 --> 01:16:16.740
Consider it a wedding gift.

1325
01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.975
Weddings always get me.

1326
01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:20.509

1327
01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:23.046
you muscle head.
You're leaking on me.

1328
01:16:23.046 --> 01:16:25.882
Oh. oh. oh!

1329
01:16:25.882 --> 01:16:29.152
Boy. they're going away
for a long time.

1330
01:16:29.152 --> 01:16:31.320
Oh. by the way.
thanks for this

1331
01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.023
fancy new watch. Got
a lot of buttons.

1332
01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:35.892

1333
01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:37.326
It's a collectible.

1334
01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:40.129
Collectible?
Consider it sold.

1335
01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:46.002
Hey. everyone. let's get
a photo with my new family.

1336
01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:48.171
All right.

1337
01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:50.239
Let's see those big smiles.

1338
01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:53.342

Lincoln.

1339
01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:55.845
Mission accomplished.
