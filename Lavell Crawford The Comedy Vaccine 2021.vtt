Teeth and haircuts

84
00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.761
I was like. "Who the fuck

85
00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:41.846
He ain't playing no more.
Charging--

86
00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.765
Charging that much

87
00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.266
He ain't playing.
He can't play

I got the Jordans.
They hurt my fucking feet.

90
00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:53.191
I'm too--I'm too grown

100
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.883

Everybody

Nobody can bitch no more.
It's an even playing ground now.

105
00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.771
You know what I'm saying?
White folks looking at niggas

106
00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:35.108
like. "Hey. don't come to me.
We're all in this

107
00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:37.944

108
00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:41.447
You gotta laugh. man.

109
00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.825
We gotta laugh.
People--We know

to still be here.
This shit--shit here.

112
00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.790
I think it was supposed
to be over. but God just let it

113
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.667
run a little longer
than He should've

114
00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.253
'cause we supposed to be gone
during Y2K.

115
00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.798

125
00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:20.320
We had a lot of shit

00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:22.530
We had AIDS.
Remember AIDS?

127
00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:26.367
AIDS was real fucked up.
Nobody put no fucking mask on.

128
00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.703
You know. they wouldn't even
put a condom on.

129
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:32.165
"Oh. she ain't sick.
She all right.

130
00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:34.125
She ain't sick.
She don't even smell

00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:54.228
"Hey. man. you got herpes?"
"Nah. that's acne."

138
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.189
"Bullshit.

149
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.385
This the only time
you supposed to wear a mask

150
00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.011
when you walk in the bank.
I walk in the bank.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.514
"Sir. you can't come in here
without a mask."

152
00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.766
I said.
"Thank you for warning me. sir."

153
00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.559
I put my mask on.
Came in.

154
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.229
"Everybody on the ground now!

155
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.607
Everybody on

156
00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.027
[laughter]

157
00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.406
"I'm just glad he's robbing us
with a mask on.

158
00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:49.742
At least be safe.

00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:55.748
'Cause people so stupid

166
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:09.929
"Cover your mouth.

I need one of 'em open.

169
00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:18.438
What kind of bullshit is that?

170
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.440
And they want you to put
that cloth shit on your--

171
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:22.817
You got a tampon
on your fucking face.

172
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:25.319
That shit hurt.
Into your goddamn nose.

173
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.613
Got a piece of metal
in the shit.

174
00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:29.240
And then. Black folk.

175
00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.576
"Shit. I blinged mine out.

176
00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:34.579
I put studs and shit
all over it.

177
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.790
I got 'God Blessed Me'
'I'm Blessed' on it."

178
00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:41.294
[laughs]
We just go too goddamn far.

179
00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:44.589
We gonna pimp our masks.

180
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.175
Shit...[laughs]

181
00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:49.177
And. you know.
the mask just so stupid

182
00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:52.472
'cause people wear 'em outside
in God's fresh air.

183
00:07:52.513 --> 00:07:55.349
Birds still
fucking flying around.

184
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:56.976
[laughter]

185
00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.478
They're like.
"Look at that dumb motherfucker

186
00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:01.147
out here with a mask on."

187
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.316
You know.
that's God's fresh air.

188
00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:05.985
What the fuck
you scared of outside?

189
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:09.322
I mean. now--I mean. I can't
get on board with this mask shit

190
00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:12.158
unless I'm outside
and a bird gonna go. [gasping].

191
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.659
Boom!
Then I'll be like. "Oh. shit.

192
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:16.329
This shit's for real.
It's for real.

193
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.457
Lord help me. Jesus."

194
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.792
But right now.
fuck the damn masks.

195
00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:24.462
I only wear it 'cause I can't
get in stores without it.

196
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.714
Soon as I get in.
I pull that bitch down.

197
00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:28.382
I'll be walking around.
"Excuse me. sir.

198
00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:31.469
Oh. I'm so sorry.

199
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.638
Did I have it down?
It just fell down.

200
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.974
I'm so sorry.
This mask got a mind of itself."

201
00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:42.355
They don't work.
If you can still smell a fart.

202
00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:44.482
you know
these masks don't work.

203
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.234
For real.
I mean. for real.

204
00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:48.528
They don't work.
I farted on a guy with a mask

205
00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:50.696
the other day.
I lit him up. too. man.

206
00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:53.533
I gave one of them
silent but deadly ones.

207
00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:55.868
Right...ah-ha!

208
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.995
And it stinked so bad
it looked like he came out

209
00:08:58.037 --> 00:08:59.580
with a knife in his hand.
I was like.

210
00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.999
"Ooh. ooh. I ain't even
gonna look at him.

211
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.584
I ain't even
gonna look at him.

212
00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.336
Hope he don't think it's me."
I turned around.

213
00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.921
He looked at me
right in my damn face.

214
00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.881
He was like--I was like.
"What's your problem?"

215
00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:12.718
He said. "Did you just fart?"
I said. "Did you smell it?"

216
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.221
He said. "Yes. I did."

217
00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:18.057
I said. "Well. your mask
is malfunctioning

218
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.226
and you should be saying
'Thank you.'

219
00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.395
'Cause I just
saved your life.

220
00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:24.397
'Cause if my fart
get through that mask.

221
00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:28.693
Lord knows COVID-19
is following right behind it."

222
00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:32.363
-[laughter]
-I'm a hero today!

223
00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.115
This the best time
to fart. though.

224
00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:37.201
I mean. in public.
It's like. fartopia out there.

225
00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.704
I be farting on groups
of motherfuckers.

226
00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:41.581
I be crop.
badab badab badab.

227
00:09:41.622 --> 00:09:43.457
Rabadab.
They don't even know it's me.

228
00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:45.710
I can just stand by
and letting shit out.

229
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:48.087
They'll be like. "Oh. my God.
it must be a sewer main

230
00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:50.089
broke around here."

231
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.466
And I be standing right there.
"Yes. this city is just

232
00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:55.595
falling apart."

233
00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:58.431
'Cause back in the day
when you had to fart.

234
00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:00.933
stomach be bothering you.
Had to find--You had to find

235
00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.810
a secret space to fart.
you know?

236
00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.604
You had to find a place
no one's at.

237
00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:06.439
Like. in the grocery store.
I find an empty aisle.

238
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.899
Usually where the disinfectants
is. you know?

239
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:12.236
'Cause if it stink too bad.
I just spray some Lysol around.

240
00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.905
You know.
Lysol is so funny.

241
00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:18.242
It kills
99.9 motherfucking odors.

242
00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.578
but shit ain't one.

243
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.413
But it smell like--
it smell like--

244
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.957
[laughs] either you shit
a bunch of lemons.

245
00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:27.627
or you shit a tree.
That's how it smell.

246
00:10:27.668 --> 00:10:29.670
I mean.
I killed that aisle. man.

247
00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:31.464
I wiped that aisle out.

248
00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:33.674
They need
to put some cones down there.

249
00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:37.178
But then always--Old Reliable.
nosey motherfucker

250
00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:40.306
come right behind me.

251
00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:43.476
"Oh. my God.
we need a manager immediately.

252
00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:46.312
I think something died
over here under these shelves.

253
00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:49.982
Sir. do you smell that?"
"No. No. I do not."

254
00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:53.861
"You don't smell that. sir?"
"No. I do not...

255
00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.280
smell it."

256
00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.450
And I got outta there
before I got arrested.

257
00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:03.162
[laughs]

258
00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:06.332
This shit--This shit get--
This shit getting stupid. man.

259
00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.542
They think we--
They think we dumb. man.

260
00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:10.169
For real.
You go to the grocery store.

261
00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.046
they got street signs
in the grocery store now.

262
00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.048
"One Way."
"Left Turn."

263
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.842
"Stop."
I went--I went down--

264
00:11:16.884 --> 00:11:18.344
back down the aisle.
this lady goes.

265
00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:21.180
"Excuse me. sir.
You're going the wrong way."

266
00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:24.350
I said. "Hell if I am.
My sour cream and onion

267
00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.852
potato chips down here.
I'll be damned

268
00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:29.313
if I walk all the way
around this fucking store

269
00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.649
to come back
where the fuck I'm at.

270
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.984
You better report me. ho.

271
00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:36.195
'cause I'm legal."

272
00:11:39.573 --> 00:11:41.534
This shit getting out of control
'cause people

273
00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:44.203
be snitching on you.
Not having your mask on.

274
00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:47.039
And every--Nobody know
all the symptoms and shit

275
00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:48.499
so. I mean.
you do something.

276
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.084
"Ah. look at him
scratchin' his forehead.

277
00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.002
That motherfucker

278
00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:54.338
Look at--Aah. what you
sniffing for. motherfucker?

279
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.007
What wrong with you?
Uh-uh. stay out of my house."

280
00:11:57.049 --> 00:12:00.386
You know. but I read on the can.
"Lysol kill COVID-19."

281
00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.346
Shit.
I got the vaccine right there.

282
00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:05.057
I just spray my face right away
with Lysol.

283
00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:07.268
It burned like a motherfucker
for like. 40 minutes.

284
00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:10.563
Then I'm good.
you know what I'm saying?

285
00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:13.733
I don't like to mask myself
because it's a burden.

286
00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:15.693
You know how it is.
You rushing.

287
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.361
I'm going to the store
real quick.

288
00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.238
I get to the fucking door
like. "Damn!

289
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.741
I forgot my damn mask."
And then my car parked

290
00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:23.743
all the way at the end
of the fucking street

291
00:12:23.784 --> 00:12:26.746
and it's raining outside.
Like. "Fuck that damn mask.

292
00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:28.289
I'm going in
the store anyway."

293
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.583
I say.
"I wish a motherfucker would

294
00:12:30.624 --> 00:12:33.085
say something to me."
I walk in the door.

295
00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:34.712
police standing
with his mask on.

296
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.756
hand on his gun. talking about.
"Sir. where your mask?"

297
00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:39.425
I stepped back and put my
underwear on my fucking face.

298
00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:42.094
I'm like--I said.
"I be damned if I get shot

299
00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:46.557
not having a mask on."
[laughs]

300
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.225
And I walk in the store
and they say.

301
00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.727
"Sir. can you put that
over your nose?"

302
00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:53.272
I said. "Ma'am.
if I put this shit over my nose.

303
00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.608
you gonna have to call
the ambulance.

304
00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:57.318
I got the balls on my face.

305
00:12:57.359 --> 00:12:59.737
I'll be damned if I put
that shit stain on my nose.

306
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.740
[laughter]

307
00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.992
[chuckles]

308
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:07.995
And I just can't believe

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:09.955

Sit at home.

318
00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:27.640
[laughter]

319
00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:30.810
Really?
You're afraid of COVID-19

00:14:09.056 --> 00:14:11.684
You gonna die from salad.
Get the fuck outta here."

336
00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:16.480
I don't--I don't like the mask
'cause it's a burden.

337
00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.524
I see you ladies--
Some people looking at me mad

338
00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:21.026
and be judging me.
You know what I'm talking about?

339
00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:22.528
"[groans]
I can't believe--"

340
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.698
Shut your ass up.
I can say the fuck I want.

341
00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:27.992
We were just normal
motherfuckers

342
00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.660
picking shit off the ground.

343
00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.370
You find a Cheeto between
your seats. be like.

344
00:14:31.412 --> 00:14:34.081
"God made dirt.
dirt don't hurt."

345
00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:36.375
Then all of a sudden
we done became germophobes.

346
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:38.878
[moaning]

347
00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:41.505
Shut up.
Get the fuck outta here.

348
00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.382
-[woman] Yes. man.
-Ugly people kissing babies

349
00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:44.884
and shit.
Didn't know--Don't even know

350
00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:46.719
where they lips been.
but all of a sudden--

351
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.013
I seen people kissing dogs!

352
00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:50.890
You know. I was on a fucking
plane with a fucking dog

353
00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:52.725
sitting right next to me.
I was like.

354
00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:55.394
"Excuse me. stewardess...

355
00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:58.397
this dog don't have
a fucking mask on.

356
00:14:58.439 --> 00:14:59.857
[laughter]

357
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.693
I don't feel safe."

358
00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:04.945
The dog looking at me like.
"Ugh. here we go

359
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.238
with this bullshit."

360
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.033
[laughter]

361
00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.076
[laughs]

362
00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:13.746
They don't make kids wear masks
and they some of

363
00:15:13.787 --> 00:15:15.414
the dirtiest motherfuckers
in the world.

364
00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.291
Little motherfuckers sneeze...
[sneezes]

365
00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.376
Snot all over the place.
I said.

366
00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.587
"That COVID-19 right there.

367
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:25.257
Get out of here.
little Johnny."

368
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:28.636
And I ain't trying--I ain't
trying to lead nobody astray.

369
00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:31.096
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not up here preaching.

370
00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:32.890
I just think that. you know.
we got--

371
00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.768
we should question a few things
like Dr. Fauci.

372
00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:37.436
I don't even know
who the fuck he is.

373
00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:40.439
He looks like COVID-19.
I don't trust that motherfucker.

374
00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:42.942
He done had it for years.
He's still around.

375
00:15:42.983 --> 00:15:44.944
It ain't--It must not
be that damn bad

376
00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:47.780
'cause the most hated president
in the world had it

377
00:15:47.821 --> 00:15:49.949
and he had it for three days.

378
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.117
[laughs]
And he was right back up.

379
00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.953
You know. I was like--
I was like.

380
00:15:53.994 --> 00:15:56.789
"What kind of COVID he have?
He must've had COVID-16."

381
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.832
You know?
Talking about. "I had it.

382
00:15:58.874 --> 00:16:00.417
I had it.
Let me tell you. I had it.

383
00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.920
All right. I had it.
I wish that. uh. Melania

384
00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.797
help me. Uh...

385
00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:07.341
But the next day I felt better
than I ever did before.

386
00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:11.261
I was like. 'Man. maybe my blood
is the vaccine.'"

387
00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:14.765
[laughter]

388
00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.351
I knew he wasn't gonna win
'cause his running mate

389
00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:20.437
is the walking dead.
Anytime you sit up there

390
00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:22.648
and got a fly
on top of your head...

391
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.150
and you don't
swat that shit one time.

392
00:16:25.192 --> 00:16:26.652
you ain't alive.
motherfucker.

393
00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.195
Come on!

394
00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:29.947
The fly was just sitting up
there like this...

395
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.866
Just like. "Hm hmm hmm.

396
00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:36.286
What you mean I'm on a head?"
You know?

397
00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:39.790
It's like. you know. they keep
calling it a "pandemic."

398
00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.667
That's what bothers me.
"A pandemic."

399
00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:43.627
I think these motherfuckers
just be making shit up

400
00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:45.671
'cause it ain't a pandemic.
You know why?

401
00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.464
You know why
it's not a pandemic?

402
00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:48.674
I seen the movie.

403
00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.509
I saw the fucking movie.
all right?

404
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:52.177
When they show the movie
they got dead bodies

405
00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:54.179
hanging outside
of abandoned cars.

406
00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:56.682
A crow eating
a fucking dead eye out.

407
00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:59.184
Motherfucking zombie going.
[groans].

408
00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:01.854
That's a fucking pandemic.
This is not a pandemic.

409
00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:03.355
This is a "massdemic."
You know why

410
00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:04.898
this ain't a pandemic?
You know why?

411
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.526
Bill collectors keep calling
my fucking house.

412
00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:10.195
How the fuck y'all still alive?

413
00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:12.322
Ain't nobody sneezed
on a keyboard

414
00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.991
at the electric company?

415
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:17.911
Ain't nobody coughed
on a monitor at the gas company?

416
00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:19.747
Lady from the car note place
called me.

417
00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:22.249
"Mr. Crawford. you're two months
behind on your car note."

418
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.252
I said. "COVID-19."

419
00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:27.046
[laughter]

420
00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:31.842
She said. "Oh. my God.
You have it?"

421
00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:35.012
I said.
"No. my bank account got it.

422
00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:39.016
It has no taste.
no smell.

423
00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:44.438
It has no funds. either.

424
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.899
We have it on a respirator
right now

425
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.110
and we're taking it
day by day."

426
00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:55.240
They be threatening
to turn shit off at my house.

427
00:17:55.282 --> 00:17:57.409
"Mr. Crawford. you're late
on your payment again.

428
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:59.411
We're gonna cut
your electricity off."

429
00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:02.122
I said. "[voice wavering]
Cut it out. Cut it off.

430
00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:04.917
You're willing to cut my
electricity off...

00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:09.088
[gasps]

[gasps]
We don't have no food.

We ain't got no lights in here.
[gasps]

435
00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:19.932
We gotta wear
masks everywhere.

436
00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:22.476
Cut it off. motherfucker!

437
00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:24.645
You gonna cut it off
in a pandemic

438
00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:29.149
I hope God forgive your soul."

439
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:32.277
He goes. "Oh. my God.

440
00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:33.904
Anybody in your house

441
00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.073

"Okay. Mr. Crawford.

00:18:40.994 --> 00:18:43.622
We'll give you six months."
"Six months?

445
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.958
That's all you're willing
to give me during a pandemic?

446
00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:48.460
Who knows
how long this is gonna go.

447
00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:51.130
They told us three months
then they told us three weeks.

448
00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:54.258
You're only gonna give me six--"
"Mr. Crawford. calm down.

"If that's what you wanna do."

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:18.490
My children ain't gonna be able

Internet or nothing

'cause you wanna

462
00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:35.007
"Six months?

"Okay. we'll match them

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.209
"I ain't sucking
your nasty ass dick."

476
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:13.503
I said. "Really?

I can't--I can't believe

We don't have nothing else."

482
00:20:26.433 --> 00:20:28.769
"Yeah. all right. motherfucker.
I'll suck your dick

483
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.854

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:34.942
Since I'm sucking your dick.

486
00:20:34.983 --> 00:20:38.362
I said. "[clears throat]
Let's calm down.

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:40.739
[laughter]

488
00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:43.242
Let's calm down.

489
00:20:43.283 --> 00:20:46.620
We gotta stay safe.

490
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:50.207
We don't know how
this is 'contracted.'

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:51.750
[laughs]

492
00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:54.544
Eating booty hole right now
don't sound like

493
00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:57.256
good judgment.

494
00:20:57.297 --> 00:21:00.092
I'ma put my mask on...

495

496
00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.266
And then shit caught on fire.
They talking about--

497
00:21:07.307 --> 00:21:11.228
I knew it was bad
when they shut down the NBA.

498
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.147
I was like.
"No. No. not really."

499
00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:16.108
LeBron'll make--
LeBron James makes

500
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:17.985
$100 million a year.

501
00:21:18.026 --> 00:21:20.112
He can stop playing

502
00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:21.405

504
00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:26.076
LeBron got so much money
his hairline does what it want

505
00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:27.786
to fucking do.

506
00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:29.663
For real.
It'd be back here.

507
00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:31.957
Then it's up here.
Then it's a bang.

508
00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:34.668
Then it'd be a curlicue
and come down to be a mustache.

509
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.920
Then it's a goatee.
[laughs]

510
00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.965
Then his sideburn.
Then it's a shag.

511
00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:43.010
That's million-dollar hair
right there.

512
00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:45.304
Shit. I don't got
that kind of money hair.

513
00:21:45.345 --> 00:21:47.639
My hair won't even grow up here.
It's like a--

514
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:50.183
like it's a No Trespassing sign
up here.

515
00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:52.311
It grow on the sides.
On my eyebrows.

516
00:21:52.352 --> 00:21:54.104
On my mouth.
but it won't grow

517
00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:57.149
on the fucking top of my head.
I got hair in my asshole.

518
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.651
I don't even know why.
I mean...

519
00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:01.820
am I growing a tail?
You know what I'm saying?

520
00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:04.656
I'm about to call one of them
hair transplant places

521
00:22:04.698 --> 00:22:06.366
like Bosley Medical
or something.

522
00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:09.619
I said. "Can you transfer
this out of my ass to my scalp?"

523
00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:11.538
I'd be walking around
brushing that shit

524
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.291
and be like. "Man.
it stink like ass around here."

525
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:15.834
"I don't know
what you talking about.

526
00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:19.338
but these waves are the shit.
[laughs]

527
00:22:19.379 --> 00:22:21.840
I'm about to get me
a doo-doo rag."

528
00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:24.843
[laughter]

529
00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:29.556
[laughs]

530
00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:31.183
Shit.

531
00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:33.518
They didn't--That didn't make me
think it was bad

532
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.520
when I was--they ended up
cutting down the NBA.

533
00:22:35.562 --> 00:22:37.898
What made me thought it was
serious when I looked outside

534
00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:40.359
and seen this homeless man
with a mask on.

535
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.527
I was like. "Wait a minute.

536
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:45.030
What does Pissy Joe know?
Shit.

537
00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:48.200
He was just eating
out of that Dumpster yesterday.

538
00:22:48.241 --> 00:22:51.161
Now he got a mask on.
What has he heard?"

539
00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:55.248
I mean. they--they think we--
You know. they think

540
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.042
this shit's smart. though.

541
00:22:57.084 --> 00:23:00.337
They got curfews in some cities.
I was in Nashville I think.

542
00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:04.383
They had a ten o'clock curfew.
Like. COVID-19's smart as shit.

543
00:23:04.424 --> 00:23:07.094
Like. you out at 10:05.
"Bitch. what you doing

544
00:23:07.135 --> 00:23:10.889

You done fucked up.

545
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:14.267
I'm about to--I'm about to get
all in your lungs.

546
00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:16.728
You know who I am?"

547
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.772
[laughs]

548
00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:20.440
I be seeing people
at restaurants

549
00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:22.234
they'll eat
and put they mask back on.

550
00:23:22.275 --> 00:23:23.860
Like COVID-19 playing
Double Dutch.

551
00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.445
"Ohhh!

552
00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:27.781
Oh. bitch. you done--
Ohh!

553
00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:31.243
Ooh oh!

554
00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:35.080
[laughter]

555
00:23:35.122 --> 00:23:37.207
[laughs]

556
00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:39.459
But. see. you know people--
people get scared

557
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:41.461
about that shit there.
But I didn't trust it

558
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:43.088
when they closed down
the churches.

559
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.965
That was some bullshit
'cause I believe in God.

560
00:23:45.006 --> 00:23:47.384
I cuss and talk a lot of shit.
but I believe in God.

561
00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:49.553
It ain't nothing but God
that let y'all came--

562
00:23:49.594 --> 00:23:51.763

563
00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:53.223
-and watch me tape this show.
-[cheers and applause]

564
00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:55.600
I don't care if you believe it
or not.

565
00:23:55.642 --> 00:23:58.437
God is good. man. you know?

566
00:23:58.478 --> 00:24:00.397
I mean. we need preachers
up in here saying.

567
00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:03.900
"In the name of Jesus.
He was born in a manger.

568
00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:06.820
His mother was a virgin.
He came down for our sins.

569
00:24:06.862 --> 00:24:08.613
He came down--
[mumbles]

570
00:24:08.655 --> 00:24:11.116
He came down to save our souls.

571
00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:14.286
He came down for our sentence.
He came down for our burden.

572
00:24:14.327 --> 00:24:17.289
He walked on water.
I said he walked on water

573
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.000
He walked on water.
Man said he was blind.

574
00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:21.460
He said--Jesus said.
'You ain't blind.

575
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:23.170
Put this thing on your face.
Peek-a-boo.

576
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:24.504
You can see me?
I can see you.'

577
00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:26.298
[laughs]

578
00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:27.966
'Jesus. I can't walk.'
'Get your ass up

579
00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:29.468
and get off that bed.

580
00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:31.636
Carry your bed on home.'
He walked on home.

581
00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:33.472
They said.
'Jesus. Lazarus is dead.'

582
00:24:33.513 --> 00:24:35.098
'No. he ain't.
Get your ass outta that grave.

583
00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.475
Lazarus.
You ain't dead.

584
00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:38.810
Get your punk ass up right now.'
[laughs]

585
00:24:38.852 --> 00:24:40.812
'Jesus. we hungry.'
'I got two pieces of fish

586
00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:43.023
and five loaves of bread.'
'Give me some Miracle Whip.

587
00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:45.358
That's right.
give me some Miracle Whip.

588
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.818
I'm gonna make
tuna fish salad.'

589
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.320
Ha

590
00:24:48.361 --> 00:24:50.780
He hung from the cross...

591
00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:53.158
and three days later
He rose from the grave.

592
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.660
I said three days later--
One. two. three.

593
00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:58.163
Three days later...
He rose from the grave

594
00:24:58.205 --> 00:24:59.706
'cause death
don't have no power.

595
00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:01.333
Death don't have no steam.

596
00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:03.502
Death can't hold me
in the ground!"

597
00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:06.505
"What about COVID-19?"
"Shut the doors!

598
00:25:06.546 --> 00:25:09.508
We going Livestream.
Shut the doors right now.

599
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:12.802
We--God tired.
He done done enough for y'all."

600
00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:15.347
[laughter]

601
00:25:15.388 --> 00:25:17.349
People get mad
I joke about it.

602
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.309
I'm a comedian.
I'm gonna joke about this shit

603
00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.853
'cause some of the shit's funny
and I don't give a fuck.

604
00:25:21.895 --> 00:25:23.480
"People dying."

605
00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:25.524
"They been dying
for motherfucking many.

606
00:25:25.565 --> 00:25:27.192
many motherfucking years.

607
00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:29.069
This ain't the first
fucking time

608
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.029
we done died. motherfucker."

609
00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:33.323
But now they keeping count?
For real?

610
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:36.493
You know.

611
00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:39.329
more than fucking 209 they died.

612
00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:40.747
Motherfucker would die

613
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:42.040
They ain't never
keep fucking count.

614
00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:44.668
All of a sudden.
"We're dying."

615
00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:46.378
You ain't gonna live
that damn long anyway.

616
00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:48.672
You gonna live long
the fuck enough and that's it.

617
00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:50.382
You ain't gonna live
fucking forever.

618
00:25:50.423 --> 00:25:53.385
I don't wanna live
past 80-85 my damn self.

619
00:25:53.426 --> 00:25:56.596
I don't wanna be too old where
I don't even know I'm alive.

620
00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:58.932
You ever seen them people?
They so old they chewing

621
00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:00.725

00:26:00.767 --> 00:26:02.227
[mumbles]

623
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:05.230
[laughter]

624
00:26:07.774 --> 00:26:12.237
"You--You hungry. Papa?"
"Nah. nah.

625
00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:14.114
I-I--"

626
00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:17.117
[laughter]

627
00:26:17.158 --> 00:26:19.286
[laughs]

628
00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:22.455
You know. that one
motherfucker be shaking--

629
00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:24.791
Like. you ask him
a bunch of questions

630
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:26.918
he don't agree with.
That...

631
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.212
[laughter]

632
00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.715
"What you--Why--
What you shake your head?"

633
00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:33.258
"[groans]"
"You agree with me?"

634
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.551
"[groans] I agree."

635
00:26:34.593 --> 00:26:36.553
"Why you keep
shaking your head nah?"

636
00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:38.722
"[groans]
What you talking about?"

637
00:26:41.474 --> 00:26:43.435
And some of them people
be too independent.

638
00:26:43.476 --> 00:26:45.604
They be getting on my nerves.
I was at Golden Corral.

639
00:26:45.645 --> 00:26:48.773
This old lady had that
palsy hand shaking everywhere.

640
00:26:48.815 --> 00:26:52.319
She's shaking corn and
mac 'n' cheese on everything.

641
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.321
It was
all in the fudge and shit.

642
00:26:54.362 --> 00:26:56.114
I was like.
"Mrs. Brown. let somebody

643
00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:59.284
get that shit for you."
"I got it!

644
00:26:59.326 --> 00:27:01.620
I got it!"

645
00:27:01.661 --> 00:27:03.455
Just shaking it.

646
00:27:03.496 --> 00:27:05.749
[laughter]

647
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.626
And she had a dog. too.
He shaking. too.

648
00:27:07.667 --> 00:27:09.336
They both...

649
00:27:09.377 --> 00:27:13.298
Like they in
they own private earthquake.

650
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.343
Shit. it scaring me. though.

651
00:27:16.384 --> 00:27:18.762
I ain't know.
I'm glad to be doing comedy

652
00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:21.806
anywhere. man. 'cause I ain't
have shit to fall back on.

653
00:27:21.848 --> 00:27:25.268
When they shut down everything.
I-I went to college

654
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.812
to drop my cousin off.
I didn't have no--

655
00:27:27.854 --> 00:27:29.939
I had no money.
I ain't have nothing

656
00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:31.983
to fall back on.
I got nervous.

657
00:27:32.025 --> 00:27:34.319
I mean.
and the toilet paper shortage?

658
00:27:34.361 --> 00:27:36.029
That shit
scared the hell outta me.

659
00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:38.448
You know. I had--
I had to hold my shit.

660
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.117
you know what I'm saying?
'Cause we use the bathroom good.

661
00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:43.036
You know. we use it--
We lived a nice life.

662
00:27:43.078 --> 00:27:45.830
We had good toilet paper.
We had that Angel Soft.

663
00:27:45.872 --> 00:27:48.041
The four-ply
with the angel laying on it.

664
00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:49.501
I used to just ball it up
and hit my ass

665
00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:51.211
and drop it in the water.

666
00:27:51.252 --> 00:27:53.380
Just ball it up and hit the ass
and drop it in the water.

667
00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:55.840
It was--It sucked all the water
out the toilet

668
00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:57.717
I had so much toilet paper
in that water.

669
00:27:57.759 --> 00:28:00.220
But when times got hard
during that pandemic.

670
00:28:00.261 --> 00:28:03.723
shit...we moved from Angel Soft
down to Scott.

671
00:28:03.765 --> 00:28:05.350
[laughter]

672
00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:07.686
Scott is one ply.
you know what I'm saying?

673
00:28:07.727 --> 00:28:10.188
But it got wood chips in it.

674
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.857
You can't wipe
all willy nilly with Scott.

675
00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:14.526
You gotta take your time.
Like--

676
00:28:14.567 --> 00:28:16.861
Like. "Ah!

677
00:28:16.903 --> 00:28:19.572
Ow!

678
00:28:19.614 --> 00:28:21.574
Oww!"

679
00:28:21.616 --> 00:28:24.077
Trying not to get no splinters
in my booty hole.

680
00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:26.079
you understand?

681
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.419
And then my wife only allowed me
three--three sheets a day.

682
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.046
So I had to get creative.
I had to learn origami

683
00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:37.841
so I could be able to get--
[laughs]

684
00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:42.262
I turned it into a swan
and then into a table football

685
00:28:42.303 --> 00:28:44.180
so I could get the crack.
Fap!

686
00:28:47.142 --> 00:28:49.060
I didn't eat finger food
for a while.

687
00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:51.104
I wasn't--I wasn't licking
nothing off my finger.

688
00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:53.606
"Eh! No."

689
00:28:53.648 --> 00:28:56.401
Toilet paper shortage.
Can't do that.

690
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.949
[laughs]

691
00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:05.410
It got ne--It got nervous
around the house.

692
00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:07.537
Man.
wasn't no money coming in.

693
00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:09.914
I was getting scared. man.
We was down to our last

694
00:29:09.956 --> 00:29:11.875
two rolls of Scott.

695
00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:13.752
two packs of Top Ramen noodles.

696
00:29:13.793 --> 00:29:16.629
we had Creamy Chicken
and motherfucker...

697
00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:18.590
beef and shit
and we got nervous.

698
00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:21.426
I was like. "All right.
it's getting crazy around here."

699
00:29:21.468 --> 00:29:22.927
You know. I had to call
a family meeting.

700
00:29:22.969 --> 00:29:25.597
"Family meeting.
Family meeting!"

701
00:29:25.638 --> 00:29:27.474
They be like. "What's wrong.
Daddy? What's wrong?"

702
00:29:27.515 --> 00:29:29.476
"Well. we ain't got no money
coming in.

703
00:29:29.517 --> 00:29:31.436
We down to our
last two rolls of Scott.

704
00:29:31.478 --> 00:29:33.438
I don't know what we gonna do."

705
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.898
"What you think we should do.
Daddy?"

706
00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:38.735
I said. "Well...
I done came to the conclusion...

707
00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:41.279
somebody might have to sell
some ass around here."

708
00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:44.324
[laughter]

709
00:29:44.365 --> 00:29:46.826
My wife said.
"Get your ass out there then."

710
00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:50.121
I--I said.
"I'm going. I'm going.

711
00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:54.793
I wonder how much money I can
get for this man pussy out here.

712
00:29:54.834 --> 00:29:57.754
I done lost a little weight...
[laughs]

713
00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:00.423
maybe somebody want it."

714
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.260
This shit got hard on me.
though. man.

715
00:30:04.302 --> 00:30:07.180
Before this shit hit.
I was  the  Lavell Crawford.

716
00:30:07.222 --> 00:30:08.431
you understand me?

717
00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:11.017
The  Lavell Crawford.

718
00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:13.520
See. y'all don't understand.
"Who are you?"

719
00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:16.314
"I'm  the  Lavell
motherfucking Crawford!"

720
00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:20.026
I was BET.  Last Comic Standing.
Breaking Bad.

721
00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:21.778
TV shows out the yin yang.

722
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.947
I was on a 30-city tour
with Mike Epps.

723
00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:27.158
-[man shouts indistinctly]
-[cheers and applause]

724
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.619
I appreciate the claps

725
00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:31.287
and I appreciate you
not clapping. sir.

726
00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.831
Thank you very much.
You're like.

727
00:30:32.872 --> 00:30:35.333
"I still don't know
who the fuck you are."

728
00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:38.127
[laughs]
He's like. "Oh. really?

729
00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:40.839
You've done a lot of things."
But. no...

730
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.716
Yes. yes. I was
the  fucking Lavell Crawford.

731
00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:45.510
but this pandemic hit...

732
00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:47.846
I used to walk around my house
talking shit.

733
00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:49.681
I did.
You know. I'd walk around

734
00:30:49.722 --> 00:30:51.307
the house. "You know why these
lights are on in the house?

735
00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:52.976
Huh? You know why these lights
are on in the house?

736
00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:54.561
Anybody know?

737
00:30:54.602 --> 00:30:57.063
These jokes keep these goddamn
lights on in the house!

738
00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:59.023
Anybody else can tell a fucking
joke and put some lights

739
00:30:59.065 --> 00:31:00.692
on in the house?
Anybody? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

740
00:31:00.733 --> 00:31:03.361
Anybody?
Anybody tell some jokes

741
00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:04.696
to keep the lights on
in the house? Huh?

742
00:31:04.737 --> 00:31:06.906
Nobody? No?

743
00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:08.658
I know you don't!

744
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.535
You know why there's food
in that refrigerator?

745
00:31:10.577 --> 00:31:13.037
Hm? You know why there's food
in that fucking refrigerator?

746
00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:15.039
Hmm?
These jokes keep that food

747
00:31:15.081 --> 00:31:17.000
in the refrigerator!
Anybody can tell some jokes

748
00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:18.418
and keep the fucking food
in the refrigerator?

749
00:31:18.459 --> 00:31:21.045
Hmm? Huh?
Huh?

750
00:31:21.087 --> 00:31:24.257
I'm the big dog around here.
[barks]"

751
00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:27.218
That pandemic hit.
I went from big dog...

752
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.888
[laughs]
to puppy dog real quick.

753
00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:32.724
I went from  the  Lavell Crawford
to Vell like a motherfucker.

754
00:31:32.765 --> 00:31:34.183
I walk around the house
humble as hell like...

755
00:31:37.103 --> 00:31:38.229
They be like.
"What's up. big dog?"

756
00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:40.690
"No. not right now.
Nah. nah.

757
00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:43.192
No. I ain't big dog right now.
I'm more like kitty cat.

758
00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:45.403
I ain't no--"
[laughs]

759
00:31:45.445 --> 00:31:47.447
And I was being real nice.
I was talking to my wife.

760
00:31:47.488 --> 00:31:49.908
I was like. "Hey. boo.
you think I can get

761
00:31:49.949 --> 00:31:51.618
a little of that orange juice?"

762
00:31:51.659 --> 00:31:53.244
She's talking to me
like I'm one of the kids.

763
00:31:53.286 --> 00:31:55.580
"Didn't your ass
just have some orange juice

764
00:31:55.622 --> 00:31:58.583
earlier like everybody else?

765
00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:00.752
Get some water.
motherfucker.

766
00:32:00.793 --> 00:32:04.547
'cause your jokes didn't pay
for this damn orange juice.

767
00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:06.883
But can your jokes
take the trash out?

768
00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:08.801
Huh? Can your jokes
take the trash out?

769
00:32:08.843 --> 00:32:11.262
Huh? Can your jokes
cut the grass? Huh?"

770
00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:13.765
I was crying
like a son of a bitch.

771
00:32:13.806 --> 00:32:18.603
"[crying]
Why you have forsaken me. Lord?

772
00:32:18.645 --> 00:32:21.147
I used to be
The  Lavell Crawford.

773
00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:23.733
I done fell off so fast.

774
00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:27.612
I didn't even go through the
stages of drug abuse. alcohol.

775
00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:29.989
I ain't get a documentary.
Hell. I ain't even get

776
00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:33.910
a  Unsung  on TV One. y'all.

777
00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:36.788
Why you do me like this.
Jesus?"

778
00:32:36.829 --> 00:32:38.915
And then my mama called.
"You need to call

779
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:42.460
the Unemployment Office
and get your unemployment."

780
00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:46.130
I said. "Ah. Lord.
I went from 30-city tour

781
00:32:46.172 --> 00:32:48.591
to now I'm calling
the Unemployment Office."

782
00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.969
My mama. "Stop.
Stop all that bullshit crying.

783
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.972
Shit. I-I called them.
I got six months back stimulus

784
00:32:54.013 --> 00:32:55.473
plus my unemployment.

785
00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:57.141
I'm getting
$2.200 every other week."

786
00:32:57.183 --> 00:32:59.811
I said. "Shit.
what's that number again?"

787
00:32:59.852 --> 00:33:03.481
I ain't even say. "Hold on."
I just clicked the fuck over.

788
00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:05.858
[laughter]

789
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.819
A little Black girl
answered the phone.

790
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.279
"Yes. yes. this is Lakeisha
at the Unemployment Office.

791
00:33:10.321 --> 00:33:12.365
How can I help you?"
I said. "Hi. Lakeisha.

792
00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:14.283
I heard you're giving people
back stimulus money

793
00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:15.702
plus their unemployment?"
"That's correct. sir.

794
00:33:15.743 --> 00:33:17.120
We're really
helping people out."

795
00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:18.997
"I'd like to help myself out.
too.

796
00:33:19.038 --> 00:33:21.666
Can I get my money. too?"
"Sir. let's get you a file.

797
00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:23.167
Your name in the files
and get you going.

798
00:33:23.209 --> 00:33:26.462
What's your name. sir?"
I went. "[clears throat]

799
00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:28.006
[laughter]

800
00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:29.507
Lavell Crawford."
She's like.

801
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:31.050
"The  Lavell Crawford?"

802
00:33:31.092 --> 00:33:33.219
I just hung up
the fucking phone.

803
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:35.179
I said. "This heffer's
about to set me up.

804
00:33:35.221 --> 00:33:37.849
She gonna have me
on Instagram Live and...

805
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.351
[laughs]
TMZ.

806
00:33:40.393 --> 00:33:44.355
"Guess who just filed
for his unemployment?

807
00:33:44.397 --> 00:33:46.899
The  Lavell Crawford.
That's right.

808
00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:49.861
The  Lavell..."

809
00:33:49.902 --> 00:33:53.865
When my cousin who ain't worked
in 30 years

810
00:33:53.906 --> 00:33:56.576
said he was getting $3.500
I called Lakeisha

811
00:33:56.617 --> 00:33:58.369
right the fuck back.

812
00:33:58.411 --> 00:34:00.872
I was like. "Hi. Lakeisha.
you know who the fuck this is.

813
00:34:00.913 --> 00:34:02.874
Yes.
this is  The  Lavell Crawford.

814
00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:04.208
Could you put my name
in them files

815
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:07.045
so I can get
my $3.500 right now?"

816
00:34:07.086 --> 00:34:09.255
My shit's still pending.

817
00:34:09.297 --> 00:34:13.217
[laughter]

818
00:34:13.259 --> 00:34:15.511
I ain't got my shit yet.

819
00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:17.221
[laughs]

820
00:34:17.263 --> 00:34:19.724
But. I mean. you know.
that's one thing

821
00:34:19.766 --> 00:34:21.893
I gotta salute my wife.
She--She got me

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:31.736
-[cheers and applause]

I was weighing 550 pounds.

830
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:41.245
I don't even know
why she was with me.

831
00:34:41.287 --> 00:34:44.916
I-I'm glad she never woke up.

832
00:34:44.957 --> 00:34:47.126
For real.
I mean. and people only wanna

00:34:47.168 --> 00:34:49.087
try to get you with
smaller people. you know?

834
00:34:49.128 --> 00:34:50.421
Bigger people--
when you a big person.

835
00:34:50.463 --> 00:34:51.756
"You need to get a girl
your size."

836
00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:53.800
I don't got no problem
with big women.

837
00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:57.136

925
00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:33.978
But there's been
some crazy times.

926
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.272
That's why I'm glad I'm married.
I got me a woman I--

927
00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:38.316

This world got crazy.

929
00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:42.153
Shit.
I live in Houston. Texas.

930
00:38:42.194 --> 00:38:46.490
We fucking had a snow storm.
I legitimately think the Lord

931
00:38:46.532 --> 00:38:48.034
is on His way back.

932
00:38:48.075 --> 00:38:50.661
I just wanna be outside

933
00:38:50.703 --> 00:38:53.331
'cause He coming back.
It snowed in Houston. Texas.

934
00:38:53.372 --> 00:38:55.458
Now. if you've ever been
to Houston. Texas.

935
00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:57.376
it's like Tempe. you know?

936
00:38:57.418 --> 00:38:59.670
Tempe get around--
I think the lowest y'all get

937
00:38:59.712 --> 00:39:01.672
about 45.
That's like Houston.

938
00:39:01.714 --> 00:39:03.841
Houston don't get around
about 45. 50.

939
00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:07.845
but it get about 300
and 99 degrees

940
00:39:07.887 --> 00:39:11.474
all summer long.
Even at fucking night.

941
00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:14.185
It gets so hot
my air conditioner be crying.

942
00:39:14.226 --> 00:39:17.355
[groaning]

943
00:39:17.396 --> 00:39:20.816
[sobbing]

944
00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:22.151
[wailing]

945
00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:26.197
What the fuck
is wrong with that shit?

946
00:39:26.238 --> 00:39:30.368
So. when we had
fucking sleet and snow...

947
00:39:30.409 --> 00:39:31.869
fucking come down.

948
00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:33.913
it shut down
the whole fucking city.

949
00:39:33.954 --> 00:39:36.374
Our electricity went off
and everything.

950
00:39:36.415 --> 00:39:40.044
And I was just thankful
I was in a better neighborhood

951
00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:42.421
where I had. you know.
I had a couple white folks

952
00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.382
that could help me out.
'Cause white folks--

953
00:39:44.423 --> 00:39:46.092
-[laughter]
-I love my Black people.

954
00:39:46.133 --> 00:39:48.427
Don't get me wrong.
but we are not good

955
00:39:48.469 --> 00:39:50.930
in apocalyptic situations.

956
00:39:50.971 --> 00:39:53.891
For real.
I'm sorry. Black folk.

957
00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:55.393
You can get offended
if you want to.

958
00:39:55.434 --> 00:39:57.228
I don't give a fuck.
but you know

959
00:39:57.269 --> 00:39:59.730
you ain't ready
for a zombie crisis.

960
00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:02.608
You ain't ready for electricity
going the fuck out.

961
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.777
If the electricity go out
at Black people's house.

962
00:40:04.819 --> 00:40:07.238
we look at the bill.
That's what we be like.

963
00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:09.448
"I don't know
what is going on.

964
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.867
Call the company
'cause I paid that shit.

965
00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:14.412
I know I paid it."

966
00:40:14.453 --> 00:40:17.289
"The whole street lights out."
"That's they business.

967
00:40:17.331 --> 00:40:19.875
I wanna make sure
our shit ain't cut off."

968
00:40:21.794 --> 00:40:23.421
White folks know how to handle
theyselves during

969
00:40:23.462 --> 00:40:25.089
this fucked up shit.
Black folk be like. "Man..."

970
00:40:25.131 --> 00:40:28.426
I had some Black friends

971
00:40:28.467 --> 00:40:30.761
Niggas didn't have no heat
gonna bring the grill

972
00:40:30.803 --> 00:40:33.264

00:40:33.305 --> 00:40:35.808
Nigga slow-roasted to death

[laughter]

976
00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:44.316
I just wanna know
who was the genius that said.

977
00:40:44.358 --> 00:40:46.735
"Let's bring the grill
in the house!"

978
00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:49.947
"Now you thinking."
No. he ain't.

979
00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:52.575
I was hanging out
with my white friends.

980
00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:54.160
he bought--
he bought a generator.

981
00:40:54.201 --> 00:40:55.453
I said. "Why you buying
that generator?"

982
00:40:55.494 --> 00:40:58.164
He's like.
"You never know."

983
00:40:58.205 --> 00:41:00.124
I said. "Bob. why you buying

986
00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:12.094
"You never fucking know."

987
00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:15.097
"Shit. why you got a Pitbull
and an alligator?"

988
00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:18.142
"I don't know."
You know?

989
00:41:19.518 --> 00:41:21.145
But I-I bought all that shit.

990
00:41:21.187 --> 00:41:23.314
I bought that generator.
Didn't even know how to use it.

991
00:41:23.355 --> 00:41:25.274
but I was sitting up there
mad as a motherfucker.

992
00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:27.318
I said. "Now how the fuck

993
00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:29.653
He had to come over.

gas in it. you gotta turn
the motherfucker on.

995
00:41:32.698 --> 00:41:34.450
and then you plug shit into it."

996
00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:36.827
Man. he put
that motherfucking gas in there.

997
00:41:36.869 --> 00:41:39.788
we turned that bitch on.
we started plugging everything.

998
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.500
All the lights on in the house.
We helped out a couple

999
00:41:42.541 --> 00:41:44.376

Like. "Let me get some

1000

1002
00:41:50.716 --> 00:41:53.052
I called the electric company.
Said. "Fuck you!

1003
00:41:53.093 --> 00:41:55.012

Only problem we had

1019
00:42:32.591 --> 00:42:34.552
was the water.

1021
00:42:37.304 --> 00:42:39.348

"That can't stay in there.

1029
00:42:55.948 --> 00:42:59.410
That's gonna be worse
than the pandemic."

1030
00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:02.246
I took a bucket of water
and I flushed that sucker down.

1031
00:43:02.288 --> 00:43:03.914
That water went.

00:52:25.851 --> 00:52:29.354
"You shut the fuck up.

1247
00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:31.523
You always got something

1248
00:52:31.565 --> 00:52:34.151
We don't wanna
climb the fucking stairs.

1249
00:52:34.192 --> 00:52:36.361
We're gonna
climb the fucking wall.

1250

[laughter]

1253
00:52:50.876 --> 00:52:53.795
"What you want me to do.

1254
00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:56.798
"I want you

1255
00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.677
and put a buffalo horn helmet

1256
00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:04.681
That's gonna
really fuck 'em up."

1257
00:53:04.723 --> 00:53:07.142
And I love--And I love--

1258
00:53:07.184 --> 00:53:10.395
And I love the security guard
they're saying was a hero.

1259
00:53:10.437 --> 00:53:14.733
That motherfucker ain't never
had an emergency ever

1260
00:53:14.774 --> 00:53:16.484
at that damn building.

1261
00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:19.196
For 30 years his ass
was sitting

1262
00:53:19.237 --> 00:53:21.531
looking at the building.
Just looking at it.

1263
00:53:21.573 --> 00:53:23.491
"Eh.

1264
00:53:28.246 --> 00:53:30.540
Hey. my DoorDash came yet?"

1265
00:53:30.582 --> 00:53:32.709
He looked out on that mob
and he heard.

1266
00:53:32.751 --> 00:53:35.045
We're not gonna take it

1267
00:53:35.086 --> 00:53:37.214
"What the fuck is that?

1268
00:53:37.255 --> 00:53:40.050
Is that a buffalo
running up here?

1269
00:53:40.091 --> 00:53:43.011
Where all them F-150s come
from?"

1270
00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:45.055
That motherfucker.
he started running

1271
00:53:45.096 --> 00:53:46.932
in them bad ass shoes.

1272
00:53:46.973 --> 00:53:49.100
His feet was killing him.

1273
00:53:49.142 --> 00:53:51.061
"I need back up.

1274
00:53:51.102 --> 00:53:54.356
My feet is killing me.
Bring me some Dr. Scholls."

1275
00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:01.947
But--
But the thing about it is. man.

1276
00:54:01.988 --> 00:54:05.575
it's so funny.
Out here we been blessed. man.

1277
00:54:05.617 --> 00:54:07.410
We been blessed.
I thank God.

1278
00:54:07.452 --> 00:54:10.747
I thank God for where we are now
'cause this shit was crazy.

1279
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:13.083
I hear they were losing
all they minds.

1280
00:54:13.124 --> 00:54:15.252
but I realized one thing.

1281
00:54:15.293 --> 00:54:20.215
In-In adversity there's always
progress and perseverance

1282
00:54:20.257 --> 00:54:23.593
and I-I look at my son.
I look at--I brought him

1283
00:54:23.635 --> 00:54:25.804
on stage and shit.
but he--you know.

1284
00:54:25.845 --> 00:54:28.098
sometimes we forget.
I always tell people.

1285
00:54:28.139 --> 00:54:31.768
"Don't ever be upset
how far you've came."

1286
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.645
You know?
Don't ever be upset.

1287
00:54:33.687 --> 00:54:37.107
It may not be where you are.
but be happy at your success

1288
00:54:37.148 --> 00:54:39.109
'cause you was over there.
now you up here.

1289
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:42.570
Just look at--It may be two feet
or it might be three miles.

1290
00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:46.283
[applause]

1291
00:54:46.324 --> 00:54:49.995
But--But never get comfortable
where you at.

1292
00:54:50.036 --> 00:54:52.122
Don't ever just sit.
"Well. I'm good right here."

1293
00:54:52.163 --> 00:54:54.082
Nah. nah. fuck that.
you know?

1294
00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.917
You're good today. but it ain't
gonna be good tomorrow.

1295
00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:58.503
Always strive for better.
you know what I'm saying?

1296
00:54:58.545 --> 00:55:00.255
You always know where you are.

1297
00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:02.674
No--And never get mad
at--'cause nobody owe you shit.

1298
00:55:02.716 --> 00:55:04.467
There's always things
that are important.

1299
00:55:04.509 --> 00:55:05.969
Like.
my son will come up to me.

1300
00:55:06.011 --> 00:55:08.680
"Dad.
I just wanna let you know."

1301
00:55:08.722 --> 00:55:11.641
He goes.
"I really hate school."

1302
00:55:11.683 --> 00:55:14.602
I said. "If you don't get
your little entitled ass...

1303
00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:18.606
downstairs and--and log in
on that goddamn computer

1304
00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:21.818
and go to class...
I wish I could go to class

1305
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.778
sitting in my Superman underwear

1306
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.115
eating a bowl of cereal
and deleting fucking teachers.

1307
00:55:28.575 --> 00:55:30.160
Motherfucker.
I hated school.

1308
00:55:30.201 --> 00:55:32.454
Every motherfucker--
I had to walk two miles

1309
00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:36.791
to the bus stop chased by
a Pitbull and a Rottweiler

1310
00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:38.543
and it was one dog.

1311
00:55:38.585 --> 00:55:40.670
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

1312
00:55:40.712 --> 00:55:43.631
And I don't know how this dog
knew my bus schedule.

1313
00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:47.177
but this motherfucker--
[laughs]

1314
00:55:47.218 --> 00:55:49.554
this motherfucker
chased me every day.

1315
00:55:49.596 --> 00:55:52.349
He was my motivation
to get to school.

1316
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:54.017
I got up there.
A little fat boy running

1317
00:55:54.059 --> 00:55:56.728
like a pig going.
"Help! Help!"

1318
00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:58.688
And I'd get up there.
had to help the bus driver

1319
00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:00.523
change a tire.

1320
00:56:00.565 --> 00:56:02.817
Then make sure to look out
so the police wouldn't get him

1321
00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:04.569
'cause he didn't have
a driver's license.

1322
00:56:04.611 --> 00:56:06.196
I'd get to school.
Got my ass whupped

1323
00:56:06.237 --> 00:56:08.365
by both bullies.
The white bully for being Black

1324
00:56:08.406 --> 00:56:10.742
and the Black bully
for being fat.

1325
00:56:10.784 --> 00:56:13.703
And then I'd get to class
and forgot my homework

1326
00:56:13.745 --> 00:56:16.706
so the teacher. evil ass.
gave me a F plus.

1327
00:56:16.748 --> 00:56:19.542
The fuck you give a nigga
a F plus for?

1328
00:56:19.584 --> 00:56:21.669
You a dirty motherfucker.
It could've been

1329
00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:22.921
a straight fucking F.

1330
00:56:22.962 --> 00:56:24.547
You gonna give me a plus
on it. bitch?

1331
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:27.550
I'll knock
your monkey ass out.

1332
00:56:27.592 --> 00:56:28.760
Then I get home.
My mama talking about.

1333
00:56:28.802 --> 00:56:30.845
"How the hell
you get a F plus?"

1334
00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:34.015
I said. "Look here. lady.
that's beside the point.

1335
00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:37.769
I got chased by a fucking
mutant Pitbull Rottweiler.

1336
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:40.939
walked up a fucking hill
two miles.

1337
00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.274
changed a fucking tire."
I'm eight. all right?

1338
00:56:43.316 --> 00:56:46.194
[laughter]

1339
00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:48.279
"And then get to school
and get my ass whupped

1340
00:56:48.321 --> 00:56:50.740
twice before I get in class?

1341
00:56:50.782 --> 00:56:55.078
Hell with that F plus.
I got an A in survival."

1342
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.039
[cheers and applause]

1343
00:57:01.501 --> 00:57:03.795
Only thing I liked about school
was free lunch.

1344
00:57:03.837 --> 00:57:06.548
I love free lunch.
I love that free lunch.

1345
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:10.051
I used to love spaghetti Tuesday
and pizza Friday. man.

1346
00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:12.262
I'd save two tickets
for pizza Friday. boy.

1347
00:57:12.303 --> 00:57:14.305
And I'd get two pieces of pizza
and scrape all the toppings

1348
00:57:14.347 --> 00:57:15.932
off one pizza
and put it on one.

1349
00:57:15.974 --> 00:57:18.726
It'd be like a meat lovers.
[whistles]

1350
00:57:18.768 --> 00:57:22.272
Oh. shit!
Get me one of them juice cups.

1351
00:57:22.313 --> 00:57:24.983
Whoo!
I love that shit.

1352
00:57:25.024 --> 00:57:27.444
I used to fuck that up
every Friday.

1353
00:57:27.485 --> 00:57:29.279
But then my mama
got a better job

1354
00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:32.657
and then she made 35 cents more
than the equivalency

1355
00:57:32.699 --> 00:57:36.119
so I couldn't get free lunch
or the reduced lunch.

1356
00:57:36.161 --> 00:57:38.288
So I had to take
my fucking lunch to school

1357
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:42.292
so I had Vienna sausage
and crackers

1358
00:57:42.333 --> 00:57:44.294
and she used to put
my milk in a mason jar

1359
00:57:44.335 --> 00:57:46.129
so it'd taste like
apple butter.

1360
00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:47.964
[laughter]

1361
00:57:48.006 --> 00:57:50.467
And on every Friday she would
make what I wanted for lunch.

1362
00:57:50.508 --> 00:57:52.427
Like. one week
she made me meatloaf.

1363
00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:56.014
but this week she--she made me
a meatloaf sandwich. you know?

1364
00:57:56.055 --> 00:57:57.765
After the--You know.
the excess meatloaf

1365
00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:59.476
on white bread
with some Miracle Whip.

1366
00:57:59.517 --> 00:58:01.436
[whistles] Off the chain.
you know what I'm saying?

1367
00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:03.313
But she said. "Well.
we out of meatloaf. baby.

1368
00:58:03.354 --> 00:58:05.148
but this Friday
whatever you want.

1369
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:07.025
I'll make it for you."
And I said. "Well. I'd love

1370
00:58:07.066 --> 00:58:08.485
a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich."

1371
00:58:08.526 --> 00:58:09.986
She said. "Peanut butter
and jelly coming up."

1372
00:58:10.028 --> 00:58:11.446
I said. "Cool."

1373
00:58:11.488 --> 00:58:13.656
She go to the--
go to the. uh. cabinet.

1374
00:58:13.698 --> 00:58:15.617
"Oh. we out of bread. baby.
I'm sorry."

1375
00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:18.161
I said. "Oh. it's cool.
Just give me some Vienna sausage

1376
00:58:18.203 --> 00:58:20.538
and crackers and I'll drink
my apple butter milk

1377
00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.373
and go on about my business."

1378
00:58:22.415 --> 00:58:24.209
She said. "Wait a minute.
I found some bread.

1379
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:26.503
I found these hotdog buns.
I'll just put some

1380
00:58:26.544 --> 00:58:28.046
peanut butter and jelly
on the hotdog buns."

1381
00:58:28.087 --> 00:58:31.966
I said. "No. No.
No. that's not gonna work.

1382
00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:34.344
We're not gonna do that
right now."

1383
00:58:34.385 --> 00:58:36.513
She's like. "What?
Bread is bread."

1384
00:58:36.554 --> 00:58:38.139
I said. "I'm not arguing
with you there.

1385
00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:41.059
Bread is bread.
In this house bread is bread.

1386
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.810
but at that school...

1387
00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:44.562
[laughter]

1388
00:58:44.604 --> 00:58:47.023
where I'm already getting
a F plus...

1389
00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:49.067
I'm getting my ass whupped
by both bullies.

1390
00:58:49.108 --> 00:58:52.820
and you dress me
like a Best Buy manager..."

1391
00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:55.490
My mama told me.
"I'ma make it for you anyway."

1392
00:58:55.532 --> 00:58:58.535
I said. "Fine.
I won't eat it at school."

1393
00:58:58.576 --> 00:59:00.411
I got to school.
I didn't even wanna go to lunch.

1394
00:59:00.453 --> 00:59:02.038
Lunch is my favorite part
of the day.

1395
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.415
So. I went outside.
Kids changing lunches.

1396
00:59:04.457 --> 00:59:06.376
Changing lunch.
"I trade you some of my Cheetos

1397
00:59:06.417 --> 00:59:08.211
for some of your Doritos."

1398
00:59:08.253 --> 00:59:10.713
"I change you a Oreo
for a piece of your Twinkie."

1399
00:59:10.755 --> 00:59:12.882
"What you got. Vell?"
I said. "Hey. I'm cutting back

1400
00:59:12.924 --> 00:59:15.426
today. fellas."

1401
00:59:15.468 --> 00:59:17.554
But the Black bully.
he didn't believe me.

1402
00:59:17.595 --> 00:59:19.180
The Black bully
by the name of Erik.

1403
00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.224
And Erik wasn't your normal
third grader.

1404
00:59:21.266 --> 00:59:24.727
He had a--He had a beard
and a mustache.

1405
00:59:24.769 --> 00:59:26.854
He had chest hair.
He worked the night shift

1406
00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:28.731
as the janitor at the school

1407
00:59:28.773 --> 00:59:31.401
and his son was in kindergarten.

1408
00:59:31.442 --> 00:59:33.903
He said. "You're a damn liar.
I know your fat ass got a--

1409
00:59:33.945 --> 00:59:36.781
I know your fat ass got--
got some good--

1410
00:59:36.823 --> 00:59:38.449
something good.
You had meatloaf last week.

1411
00:59:38.491 --> 00:59:40.076
You didn't give me none of that.
You gonna give me

1412
00:59:40.118 --> 00:59:41.619
some of that damn
whatever you got in your bag."

1413
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:44.914
He snatched my bag
and he saw that hotdog bun.

1414
00:59:44.956 --> 00:59:47.458
And. you know. third graders.
they see a hotdog.

1415
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.919
it's like filet mignon.
"Oh. shit!

1416
00:59:49.961 --> 00:59:53.423
Lavell got a hotdog.
y'all!"

1417
00:59:53.464 --> 00:59:55.592
I said. "Erik.
looks can be deceiving.

1418
00:59:55.633 --> 00:59:57.260
Don't--Don't--

1419
00:59:57.302 --> 00:59:59.220
It's not necessarily
a hotdog."

1420
00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.389
He said. "Shut your fat ass up
and break me off a piece

1421
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.808
of that hotdog right now
before I whup your ass."

1422
01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.102
I said. "I just don't
want you to be surprised

1423
01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.479
when I break it."

1424
01:00:08.521 --> 01:00:10.440
So. I broke that
motherfucking hotdog bun.

1425
01:00:10.481 --> 01:00:13.318
He seen that peanut butter
and jelly ooze outta there.

1426
01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:17.113
He snapped. "What kind
of fucking appetite you got?

1427
01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:20.617
You putting peanut butter
and jelly on a hotdog bun?

1428
01:00:20.658 --> 01:00:23.411
You ain't got no
mustard or ketchup?"

1429
01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:27.332
And I broke down and said.
"My mama ran out of bread."

1430
01:00:27.373 --> 01:00:30.293
He started laughing.
"[laughs] Lavell poor!

1431
01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:31.919
He can't afford bread."

1432
01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.796
And I ran off crying
and I had to eat

1433
01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:37.425
with the faculty
the rest of the year.

1434
01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.802
Thank you. ladies and gentlemen.

Man. you know
I always need you. man.

1441
01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:01.491
Oh.
I knew I'd be back. man.

1442
01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:03.159
I was a little nervous.

1443
01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:05.203
-You know how we play with you.
-Yeah. yeah.

1444
01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:06.829
But Junior was asking me
a question

1445
01:01:06.871 --> 01:01:09.499
something I forgot about.
He was asking me

1446
01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.876
how much--how much
he supposed to get paid.

1447
01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:14.212
And I just remembered
I let you grab the check.

1448
01:01:14.253 --> 01:01:15.463
-Right.

1449
01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.006
Let me get that back
from you.

1450
01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.549
-You want the check back?
-Yeah. man. I mean.

1451
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:20.468
-Junior gotta get paid.
-I mean. he ten.

Hey. look. hey. man.

1454
01:01:24.555 --> 01:01:26.474
Just give Junior the check.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:29.143

1457
01:01:30.728 --> 01:01:33.856
-You need a ride back?
-My rent due on the first.

01:01:33.898 --> 01:01:35.483
All right. yeah.
I--You know what?

1459
01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.652
-I needed that.
-We'll say a prayer for you.

1460
01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.362
I gotta go to a prayer meeting
this week.

1461
01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:40.655
-Man. I got you. though.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.580
I need you to chip in

01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:51.666
-But--
-Let's stop arguing about it.

1467
01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.544
We'll argue at home.
You got 1.200 in your pocket.

1468

You got a new job.
You gonna make much more money.
