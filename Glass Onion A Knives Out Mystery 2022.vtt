167
00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:35.583
-Ma!
-It's a compass!

168
00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:37.166
Okay. north. south…

169
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.916
Okay. N is for north.
so turn it due north.

00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:49.708
-[gasps] It's music. Guys. it's music!
-Shh!

173
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:51.958
-Are you mocking me?
-Yes.

174
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:55.541
Okay. ha-ha. I'm gonna Shazam it.

175
00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:56.750
What is that?

176
00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:02.208
Alexa. Shazam this song please.
Alexa. Shazam this song please.

177
00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:05.791
Hey. this is Bach's <i>Little Fugue</i>
in G Minor.

178
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:07.416
-You sure?
-Yeah.

179
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.541
Uh. I'm Shazam-ing it.
Alexa. Shazam this song please.

180
00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:14.750
So a fugue is a beautiful musical puzzle
based on just one tune.

181
00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:18.250
<i>And when you layer this tune</i>
<i>on top of itself.</i>

182
00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:22.416
it starts to change
and turns into a beautiful new structure.

183
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.583
This can't Shazam. It's a lamp.

00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:27.208
-I love you. Birdie.
-I love you too. Claire.

Wait. "La-la-layered back over itself."
Hold on.

Ooh. ooh. ooh!

Forty-seven for sure?

197
00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:05.291
That's the atomic number for silver.

198
00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:07.875
-Are you-- Are you sure that's silver?
-That's silver.

199
00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:10.500
So this is it.

200
00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:14.250

the stir at her arrival.

00:18:33.208 --> 00:18:36.166
Yeah. That was a stir.

351
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.083
She's not in your little gang?

00:18:59.458 --> 00:19:01.208
The question isn't.
"Why did he invite her?"

361
00:19:02.916 --> 00:19:04.791
It's. "Why did she show up?"

That's Derol. He's just staying here.
He's going through things.

420

-[Claire] Yep.
-[Miles] It's past. present and future.

438

It's what came before. where I am now.
what I'll leave to the world.

439
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:52.708
Ignore me.

440
00:22:52.791 --> 00:22:55.958
This is the full reclamation of everything
I've achieved up to now--

441
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:59.041
So. what kind of staff does it take
to run a place like this?

442
00:22:59.125 --> 00:23:02.875
Normally like 50. but. you know…
Look. I sent everyone home.

443
00:23:02.958 --> 00:23:06.125
I just wanna have a normal weekend
with my old friends like the old days.

00:23:06.208 --> 00:23:08.541
Right? See. look. that's the thing.

445
00:23:08.625 --> 00:23:10.791

a rich-asshole house. It's…

I mean. it's not even a house.

447
00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:17.041

in this murder mystery game

I'd be more than happy to oblige.

Just to be included and to… To meet you…

481
00:25:08.333 --> 00:25:10.166
Is that a motorcar?

482
00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:12.458
Oh. yeah. That's my Baby Blue.

483
00:25:12.541 --> 00:25:16.000
It's one-of-a-kind. Goes anywhere I go.
All around the world.

484
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.541
Why is it on the roof?

485
00:25:20.041 --> 00:25:22.083
'Cause there's nowhere to drive it
on the island.

486
00:25:22.583 --> 00:25:25.208
[inhales] Oh. yes. Yes. of course.

487
00:25:25.291 --> 00:25:26.791
[Miles] Mr. Blanc. uh…

488
00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:28.375
I wanted to ask.

489
00:25:29.833 --> 00:25:31.125
what are you doing here?

490
00:25:31.708 --> 00:25:33.166
[spluttering] I'm sorry?

491
00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.541
What are you doing here?

[scoffs]

493
00:25:37.083 --> 00:25:39.000
Uh. you invited me.

494
00:25:39.666 --> 00:25:40.750
No. I didn't.

495
00:25:41.416 --> 00:25:42.458
What…

496
00:25:44.791 --> 00:25:46.500
You sent me a box.

497
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.083
-Wait. you received a box?
-[Benoit] Yes.

498
00:25:50.166 --> 00:25:55.541
The wooden box was delivered to my home
with some simple children's puzzles

499
00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:59.083
which. once I completed them.
there was an invitation inside.

500
00:25:59.166 --> 00:26:00.541
Do you have that invitation?

501
00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:02.166
Well. yes. I do. [laughs]

502
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.666
I'm sorry. I'm… I'm very confused.

503
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.708
[spluttering] Is this part of the game?

504
00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:09.791
[mouthing] No.

505

How many of these boxes did you create?

508

-Five. One for each of my friends.
-No test boxes? No prototypes?

509

No. my puzzle guy barely got the five done
in time.

is there any way to close them again?
To… To reset 'em?

[sighs] Mr. Bron. I've learned
through bitter experience

523
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.666
that an anonymous invitation
is not to be trifled with.

-Oh. I left it in my room.
-[Miles] Okay.

643
00:33:18.208 --> 00:33:22.208
If you want to shake things up.
you start with something small.

644
00:33:22.291 --> 00:33:24.791
You break a norm.
or an idea. or a convention.

645

some little business model.

646
00:33:26.041 --> 00:33:29.458
But you go with things
that people are kind of tired of anyway.

Everybody gets excited
because you're busting up something

that everyone wanted broken
in the first place.

649
00:33:36.083 --> 00:33:39.000
That's the infraction point.

650
00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:42.625
That's the place
where you have to look within yourself

651
00:33:43.416 --> 00:33:46.666
and ask. "Am I the kind of person
who will keep going?"

652
00:33:47.916 --> 00:33:49.333
Will you break more things?

653
00:33:50.291 --> 00:33:51.958
Break bigger things?

654
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:56.916
Are you willing to break <i>the</i> thing
that nobody wants you to break?

655
00:33:57.875 --> 00:34:01.750
Because at that point.
people are not gonna be on your side.

656
00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:03.833
They're gonna call you crazy.

657
00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:07.125
They're gonna say you're a bully.
They're gonna tell you to stop.

658
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.416
Even your partner will say.
"You need to stop."

659
00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:13.916
Because as it turns out.

660
00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:18.958
nobody wants you to break
the system itself.

661
00:34:20.208 --> 00:34:23.375

662
00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:28.041
And that is what unites all of us.

663
00:34:29.291 --> 00:34:32.750
We all got to that line and crossed it.

00:44:14.458 --> 00:44:16.458
I call it Klear. with a K.

846
00:44:16.541 --> 00:44:20.500
And at this event.
we are going to announce "Klear America."

847
00:44:20.583 --> 00:44:22.583
Our affordable home power solution.

848
00:44:22.666 --> 00:44:25.333
Klear is going to be powering
people's dreams.

849
00:44:25.416 --> 00:44:27.916
all over this country.
by the end of this year.

850

-[glass shield thuds]

851
00:44:30.583 --> 00:44:31.416
No.

852
00:44:32.625 --> 00:44:34.916
No. Because I was clear with you.

853
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.708
I told you I need two years minimum

854
00:44:37.791 --> 00:44:40.916
to test this stuff
to see if it's safe or even viable.

855
00:44:42.125 --> 00:44:45.541
Claire and I are not gonna be responsible
for putting something out in the world

856
00:44:45.625 --> 00:44:47.291
before it's tested and--

857
00:44:52.208 --> 00:44:53.208
Oh. no.

858
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.208
Oh. yeah.

859
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:56.708
No.

860
00:44:56.791 --> 00:45:00.750
You're running this entire place off this?

861
00:45:00.833 --> 00:45:03.208
All of it. All this awesome lighting.

862
00:45:03.916 --> 00:45:07.000
the heating and cooling.
everything right down to my fax machine.

863
00:45:07.916 --> 00:45:10.958
The whole Glass Onion is powered by Klear.

864
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.333
Oh my God. Miles.

865
00:45:13.708 --> 00:45:15.750
Guys. we did it.

866
00:45:15.833 --> 00:45:16.791
I'm out. I'm done.

867
00:45:18.416 --> 00:45:22.375
This is reckless.
And you're gonna get somebody killed.

868
00:45:22.458 --> 00:45:24.291
Bro. you're not getting out.

869
00:45:24.916 --> 00:45:26.291
It's already happening.

870
00:45:27.166 --> 00:45:29.916
I love you. Come on. let's… Let's eat!

871
00:45:31.541 --> 00:45:32.916
[Lionel sighs heavily]

872
00:45:34.416 --> 00:45:35.625
Okay. gang.

873
00:45:36.625 --> 00:45:41.500
It's been a memorable weekend already.
to be sure. but now the real fun starts.

874
00:45:43.083 --> 00:45:47.416
We got three days to bask in the sun.
swim in the Ionian Sea.

875
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.750
eat good food and wine.
and enjoy each other's company.

876
00:45:49.833 --> 00:45:54.958
But alongside and underneath the partay.
you've been charged with a serious task.

877
00:45:55.583 --> 00:46:00.750
Because tonight. in this very room.
a murder will be committed.

878
00:46:00.833 --> 00:46:01.833
[Claire scoffs]

879
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.375
My murder.

880
00:46:04.375 --> 00:46:06.708
You will have
to closely observe the crime.

881
00:46:07.333 --> 00:46:09.000
Consider what you know about each other.

882
00:46:09.083 --> 00:46:12.375
Know that across the island.
I've hidden clues.

883
00:46:12.458 --> 00:46:16.625
Some may be helpful. some may misdirect.
That's for you to determine.

884
00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:23.541
But if anyone can name the killer.
tell me how they achieved the murder.

885
00:46:23.625 --> 00:46:26.875
and. most importantly.
what was the motive.

886
00:46:26.958 --> 00:46:29.041
that person wins our game.

887
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:33.583
Any questions?

888
00:46:33.666 --> 00:46:36.625
Uh. wait… What do we win?

889
00:46:37.916 --> 00:46:40.250
I… What do you mean? What do you…

890
00:46:41.083 --> 00:46:42.125
What do you want?

891
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.791
No. No. nothing. I just…

892
00:46:44.875 --> 00:46:47.458
I just thought maybe
there was a prize or something.

893
00:46:48.291 --> 00:46:51.041
I… An iPad or like…

894
00:46:53.708 --> 00:46:56.125
Okay. fine.
Yeah. no. the winner gets an iPad.

895
00:46:57.083 --> 00:47:01.875
And. uh. once you're dead.
will we still be able to talk to you?

896
00:47:02.583 --> 00:47:05.541
Yeah. I'm not playing dead
the whole weekend. dude. [splutters]

897
00:47:05.625 --> 00:47:06.708
We hang. but I…

898
00:47:06.791 --> 00:47:09.416
You just can't ask me questions.
I'm not gonna help.

899
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.000
I don't actually need an iPad.
I'm just saying. It's just…

900
00:47:13.083 --> 00:47:16.583
When you said "win." it…
You know. it made me say it.

901
00:47:16.666 --> 00:47:18.458
Can we. um. work together?

902
00:47:19.291 --> 00:47:21.708
[Miles] Um. only one person
can solve the crime.

903
00:47:21.791 --> 00:47:25.583
so if you got a theory.
keep it close to your chest.

904
00:47:25.666 --> 00:47:28.958
It's designed to be hard.
This will take the whole weekend.

905
00:47:29.041 --> 00:47:30.791
Well. this is truly delightful.

906
00:47:32.083 --> 00:47:34.291
Oh! Have we started already. is it--

907
00:47:34.375 --> 00:47:36.791
-Well. the murder hasn't happened. But…
-Oh. yeah.

908
00:47:36.875 --> 00:47:39.416
Yeah. why not? As Watson said to Holmes--

909
00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:43.458
It was Birdie
who planted a remote device on a crossbow

910
00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:47.541
in revenge for you stealing
her signature Ren Diamond.

911
00:47:51.708 --> 00:47:53.458
Look at the seating arrangement.

912
00:47:54.041 --> 00:47:58.375
It triangulates Birdie
just perfectly with that thing.

913
00:47:58.958 --> 00:48:00.958
which is loaded with a dummy bolt.

914
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:03.666
Aimed directly…

915
00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:07.541
at Mr. Bron.

916
00:48:08.208 --> 00:48:13.333
Now I believe close inspection will reveal
some sort of remote triggering device.

917
00:48:13.416 --> 00:48:19.500
but more damning.
that is a vintage Jayhawk brand crossbow.

918
00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:22.166
Jayhawk. Birdie Jay.

919
00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:25.875
Of course. there are other superfluous
and rather clumsy clues.

920
00:48:25.958 --> 00:48:28.375
The hedgerow
in the south garden spells letter B.

921
00:48:28.458 --> 00:48:31.833
Birdie's room is the sacral chakra.
which is the one blocked by guilt.

922
00:48:31.916 --> 00:48:35.958
Blah. blah. blah. But the motive. yes.

923
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:40.000
on the cleverly planted 1998 issue
of <i>The Face</i> magazine

924
00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:41.750
with Birdie on the cover…

925
00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:46.916
[chuckles] …she famously wore
what became known as the Ren Diamond.

926
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
And that's a family heirloom. I believe.

927
00:48:49.083 --> 00:48:53.958
Well. to be clear. I mean. I didn't know
what a "blood diamond" was so--

928
00:48:54.041 --> 00:49:00.083
Mr. Bron. the large pendulous locket
which is… Has not left your neck.

929
00:49:00.166 --> 00:49:04.041
[chuckles] Bit out of keeping
with your breezy island style.

930
00:49:04.791 --> 00:49:06.666
Would you kindly open it for us?

931
00:49:12.875 --> 00:49:13.875
[screams]

932
00:49:14.791 --> 00:49:15.875
My Ren Diamond!

933
00:49:15.958 --> 00:49:20.500
A dramatic. passionate
and colorful crime for a fashionista.

934
00:49:20.583 --> 00:49:21.916
Miss Birdie Jay.

935
00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:28.208
Unfortunately. this crime clashed
with the presence of Benoit Blanc.

936
00:49:33.833 --> 00:49:34.791
[Benoit laughs] Oh!

937
00:49:34.875 --> 00:49:39.500
That… See that? That just went up…
Very good. Very good.

938
00:49:41.833 --> 00:49:48.166
My God. that just felt so good.
So solid. so satisfying!

939
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.625
You know. like one of those
mini-crosswords <i>The Times</i> has

940
00:49:51.708 --> 00:49:56.083
or. you know. I have a chef friend.
and she speaks of trying to create

941
00:49:56.166 --> 00:50:01.833
the perfect bite and that just felt like
the most satisfying bite-sized--

942
00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:09.166
You're angry.

943
00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:15.000
No. Blanc. I'm. uh. just. you know…

944
00:50:15.708 --> 00:50:16.708
What the hell?

945
00:50:17.625 --> 00:50:21.458
That was not
the simplest thing to set up. so…

946
00:50:21.541 --> 00:50:24.208
It's fine. It doesn't matter. It's just…

947
00:50:24.291 --> 00:50:26.666
I hired Gillian Flynn
to write the whole thing--

948
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:30.583
-Oh. she's quite good.
-She's goddamn expensive. is what she is.

949
00:50:31.458 --> 00:50:35.333
What am I supposed to do now?
Play Yahtzee all weekend? Just… [exhales]

950
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:42.333
Mr. Bron. truth is.
I… I ruined your game on purpose

951
00:50:43.458 --> 00:50:45.458
and for a very good reason.

952
00:50:45.541 --> 00:50:46.875
I'm sorry. what?

953
00:50:48.833 --> 00:50:51.708
I like the Glass Onion as a metaphor.

954
00:50:51.791 --> 00:50:54.666
An object that seems densely layered.

955
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:57.583
but in reality
the center is in plain sight.

956
00:50:58.166 --> 00:51:01.708
Your relationship with these people
may seem complex.

957
00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:04.833
but look. what you've done
this weekend is crystal clear.

958
00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:07.416
You've taken seven people.

959
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.791
each of whom has a real-life reason
to wish you harm.

960
00:51:10.875 --> 00:51:13.791
gathered them together on a remote island

961
00:51:13.875 --> 00:51:17.250
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads.

962
00:51:18.583 --> 00:51:22.375
It's like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights!

963
00:51:22.458 --> 00:51:24.166
Oh. whoa. [chuckles]

964
00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:25.375
Come on.

965
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.750
So you play hardball with Lionel.
threaten to destroy his reputation

966
00:51:30.833 --> 00:51:34.500
if he does not play along
and power a manned rocket with Klear.

967
00:51:34.583 --> 00:51:36.250
But now with Claire too…

968
00:51:36.333 --> 00:51:39.083
Now perhaps.
you threaten to support her opponent

969
00:51:39.166 --> 00:51:43.958
in the up-and-coming election
if she does not approve your power plant.

970
00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:46.208
You have done some homework.

971
00:51:46.291 --> 00:51:49.000
And Birdie. Bangladesh.

972
00:51:49.083 --> 00:51:51.958
Sweetie Pants are manufactured there
in a sweatshop.

973
00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:55.458
You're making Birdie take the fall
to cover your ass as the main investor.

974
00:51:56.916 --> 00:52:02.375
And Duke? Well… [chuckles]
…we all know why Duke wants to kill you.

975
00:52:02.958 --> 00:52:04.208
He doesn't know about that.

976
00:52:04.791 --> 00:52:06.208
Yes. he does.

977
00:52:07.666 --> 00:52:10.666
Take my presence as a sign.

978
00:52:11.375 --> 00:52:16.500
For at least one person on this island.
this is not a game.

979
00:52:19.208 --> 00:52:21.833
Oh. this is the famous napkin!

980
00:52:21.916 --> 00:52:23.791
I know this story.

981
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.125
-Right…
-Will you look at that?

982
00:52:26.208 --> 00:52:29.708
I sketched out the original idea
for Alpha on a cocktail napkin

983
00:52:29.791 --> 00:52:32.583
and I showed it to Andi one night
at the Glass Onion.

984
00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:34.791
That was our local bar.

985
00:52:36.375 --> 00:52:40.791
That's where it all began.
But they tore it down the year after that.

986
00:52:40.875 --> 00:52:41.750
[Benoit] Mm-hmm.

987
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:44.500
[sighs] Andi.

988
00:52:45.625 --> 00:52:46.791
Yes. Andi.

989
00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:49.875
Andi used to tell me the truth.

990
00:52:51.041 --> 00:52:52.458
Nobody does that now.

991
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:56.166
It's all just fake smiles and agendas

992
00:52:56.250 --> 00:53:00.250
and people wanting
what they think they're owed.

993
00:53:00.833 --> 00:53:06.000
Hating you when you don't give it to them
because that's what you're there for.

994
00:53:10.291 --> 00:53:15.333
I know it's probably hard to have sympathy
for the poor. tortured billionaire. But…

995
00:53:16.708 --> 00:53:18.416
God damn. I miss that bar.

00:54:05.625 --> 00:54:08.291
-Fine. You're murdering my vibe.
-[cell phone ringing]

1013
00:54:08.375 --> 00:54:11.791
[Lionel] Well. I hate saying this
in any context.

1014
00:54:11.875 --> 00:54:12.791
but I'm with Duke.

1015
00:54:12.875 --> 00:54:16.583
Or we can get drunk
and enjoy paradise for the weekend.

1016
00:54:16.666 --> 00:54:18.750
We should probably go too.

1017
00:54:18.833 --> 00:54:22.791
No. Miserable in paradise.
We've all earned this.

1018
00:54:22.875 --> 00:54:24.041
Yes. you have.

1019
00:54:29.541 --> 00:54:32.083
Are we even gonna talk about
the elephant in the room?

1020
00:54:32.583 --> 00:54:35.625
Or just gonna throw a blanket over it
and push through the weekend?

1021
00:54:35.708 --> 00:54:36.666
Am I the elephant?

1022
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:39.250
Yeah. You're the elephant!

1023
00:54:39.333 --> 00:54:40.333
You're not that bad.

1024
00:54:40.416 --> 00:54:42.125
[Lionel] What'd you come for. Andi?

1025
00:54:42.875 --> 00:54:45.333
Given the circumstances.
I think it's a fair question.

1026
00:54:45.958 --> 00:54:46.791
Fair?

1027
00:54:46.875 --> 00:54:51.875
Oh my God. Yes. no. fine.
Nothing about any of this is fair.

1028
00:54:51.958 --> 00:54:53.583
Congratulations. Now. you know.

1029
00:54:55.208 --> 00:54:58.958
And we all stuck with Miles.
What do you want?

1030
00:54:59.833 --> 00:55:04.708
Do you wanna know why we did it? Hmm?
Really? Why? Do the math. It's easy math.

1031
00:55:05.708 --> 00:55:09.666
[scoffs] So you come here.
in your Gucci flats. telling us…

1032
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:10.583
Valentino.

1033
00:55:10.666 --> 00:55:11.791
…that we owe you?

1034
00:55:12.458 --> 00:55:14.833
You made money off of Alpha
all those years.

1035
00:55:14.916 --> 00:55:16.583
You did fine. You got yours.

1036
00:55:16.666 --> 00:55:17.500
I got?

1037
00:55:18.625 --> 00:55:23.000
No. he got his from me. All of it!

1038
00:55:23.583 --> 00:55:28.291
My life was taken away from me
by someone. by everyone in this room.

1039
00:55:28.375 --> 00:55:31.500
My life! Do you even know what that means?

1040
00:55:31.583 --> 00:55:32.625
Huh?

1041
00:55:32.708 --> 00:55:35.416
What Claire's trying to say.
is we're sorry.

1042
00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:38.708
We feel bad for you. What do you want?

1043
00:55:38.791 --> 00:55:41.250
-Are you really asking me that?
-[Claire] Yes. What do you want?

1044
00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:43.541
A check? You want performative pity?

1045
00:55:43.625 --> 00:55:44.625
[sighs]

1046
00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:47.458
Just tell us the right words
that we can use

1047
00:55:47.541 --> 00:55:49.416
so that we can get on with our lives.

1048
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.083
You want revenge?
You want to slit Miles' throat?

1049
00:55:52.791 --> 00:55:56.916
You wanna take us all down?
What? Just drop the bombshell! Say it!

1050
00:55:57.875 --> 00:55:59.625
-Say it!
-I want the truth!

1051
00:55:59.708 --> 00:56:00.750
[thuds]

1052
00:56:00.833 --> 00:56:03.083
I want the truth.

1053
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.166
I can give you that.

1054
00:56:09.916 --> 00:56:11.125
I'll be the asshole.

1055
00:56:11.958 --> 00:56:12.833
[sighs]

1056
00:56:14.916 --> 00:56:20.708
The truth is. is that we
are all holding on to that golden tit.

1057
00:56:21.583 --> 00:56:23.375
We're all playing
the same game here. honey.

1058
00:56:24.541 --> 00:56:25.500
You lost.

1059
00:56:26.708 --> 00:56:29.166
So you can go ahead
and put yourself up on a cross

1060
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:32.750
like some unspeakable crime
has been committed against you

1061
00:56:32.833 --> 00:56:34.791
that none of us could possibly imagine.

1062
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.041
But me. I'm tired of pretending
like you're the victim in this game.

1063
00:56:42.291 --> 00:56:43.708
You just couldn't hack it.

1064
00:56:45.833 --> 00:56:49.500
You're the loser. There. That's the truth.

Oh. jeez. detective.

1072

Hey. Alpha DJ. give us something upbeat!

1076
00:57:15.541 --> 00:57:18.166
Miles. I'm gonna be leaving
in the morning.

-["Star" by David Bowie playing]
-Yeah. me too.

1078

No. No. we're having a champagne brunch
on the beach tomorrow.

1079
00:57:24.375 --> 00:57:25.750
You're gonna try foil surfing.

1080

work on that tan.

1081

"What was she doing in lockdown?"

There it is. there's my guy.

1088

What's going on?
You look like you got good news.

1089

I was wondering
why my Googs are blowing up.

1090

are off the charts. You gotta see this.

Ooh!

1092
00:57:57.708 --> 00:58:00.916
This is all over the Internet.
I mean. look at those numbers.

1093

That's fire. That changes things. right?

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:05.500
It sure does.

1095
00:58:05.583 --> 00:58:09.458

Maybe we can talk Alpha News?

1109
00:58:42.791 --> 00:58:47.041
Five minutes ago. Blanc was telling me
that this whole party was a dangerous idea

1110

'cause you all hate me so much
that one of you would actually wanna…

in his airways.

the cause of death without an autopsy.

that nobody touch the body

or disturb anything around it.

1164
01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:29.625

1165
01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:33.833
Are you treating this
as a crime scene then?

1166

Oh my God. No. wait. wait. this is bad.
[spluttering] I can't. I…

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:02.625
Well. we don't know.

1178
01:02:03.333 --> 01:02:06.750
But Mr. Cody's death was
so acute and violent… yes.

1179
01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:13.333
My guess is something
was put in his drink. intentionally.

1180
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.000
[dramatic music playing]

1181
01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:21.875
What do you mean "morning"?
How's that possible?

1182
01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:24.500
[Andino] <i>Pisceshite! Dock is Pisceshite!</i>

1183
01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:26.791
Piece-of-shite. Piece of…

1184
01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:33.625
Boat can't come till low tide
in the morning. 6:00 a.m. at the earliest.

1185
01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:35.958
Do they understand the situation?

1186
01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:37.666
There is no other landing point.

1187
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:41.250
and Miles' dumbass Banksy dock
was set to low-tide height

1188
01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:43.708
and it isn't buoyant.
It is a piece of shit.

1189
01:02:43.791 --> 01:02:47.125
Oh. heck. Yeah. all right. all right. Um…

1190
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:52.291
I suggest you all retire to your rooms.
lock the doors until 5:30.

1191
01:02:53.041 --> 01:02:56.208
when we will convene here
and walk together to the dock.

1192
01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:57.833
I'll stay up all night with the body.

1193
01:02:57.916 --> 01:03:00.791
Make sure it's not tampered with
in any way.

1194
01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:03.541
I recommend that everyone gets some sleep.

1195
01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:10.000
Oh!

1196
01:03:14.166 --> 01:03:16.250
That is…

1197
01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:18.708
[gasps] That's your glass. Miles.

1198
01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:23.291
[Miles] He…

1199
01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:26.750
He picked up mine.

1200
01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:32.333
He picked up mine.

1201
01:03:32.416 --> 01:03:33.333
He…

1202
01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.791
Now we could…

1203
01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:40.708
Uh…

1204
01:03:41.333 --> 01:03:43.291
Oh. come on. Miles.

1205
01:03:43.375 --> 01:03:45.125
Miles. it's us!

1206
01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:46.750
Miles. baby. for real?

1207
01:03:47.541 --> 01:03:49.000
I'll pay you one billion dollars

1208
01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:50.833
to tell me
which one of them tried to kill me.

1209
01:03:50.916 --> 01:03:51.958
-Miles!
-Miles!

1210
01:03:52.041 --> 01:03:53.500
-[phone dings]
-[glass shield thuds]

1211
01:03:53.583 --> 01:03:55.541
I'm just going to silence Duke's phone.

1212
01:03:57.666 --> 01:03:59.041
We're staying here in this room.

1213
01:03:59.125 --> 01:04:02.833
I'm keeping you all in plain sight
until that boat arrives.

1214
01:04:02.916 --> 01:04:05.333
-That's what we're doing.
-For God's sakes.

1215
01:04:05.416 --> 01:04:06.250
[scoffs]

1216
01:04:07.208 --> 01:04:10.041
Where's Whiskey? Where's Andi?

1217
01:04:10.125 --> 01:04:11.958
Where's Duke's phone?

1218
01:04:12.041 --> 01:04:14.625
It just dinged. It must be here.

1219
01:04:14.708 --> 01:04:16.041
[Lionel] Yeah. I saw it.

1220
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:17.750
We just heard it.

1221
01:04:18.375 --> 01:04:19.958
It isn't in any of his pockets.

1222
01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:23.708
Well. he must have dropped it somewhere.
Let's wait for it to ding again.

1223
01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:25.375
Forget about his phone. Look.

1224
01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:31.250
Where is his stupid gun?

1225
01:04:33.083 --> 01:04:37.250
Oh. fiddlesticks.
When did his gun disappear?

1226
01:04:37.333 --> 01:04:38.750
He always has his gun.

1227
01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:42.416
Well. he always has it.
which means we stopped seeing it.

1228
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.583
But at some point this evening.
it was gone.

1229
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:47.625
-When was that?
-Andi.

1230
01:04:47.708 --> 01:04:49.208
We need to find Andi.

1231
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:50.583
[Miles] Andi!

1232
01:04:51.208 --> 01:04:52.500
Oh. [sputters]

1233
01:04:52.583 --> 01:04:54.666
-Mr. Bron!
-[male voice over speakers] <i>Dong!</i>

1234
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:58.500
Oh. it's all right.
It's just that hourly dong thing.

1235
01:04:58.583 --> 01:04:59.708
What?

1236
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:02.916
-Oh. no. No.
-Miles. calm down!

1237
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.333
Oh. shit. Shit.

1238
01:05:04.416 --> 01:05:06.958
-No. It's happening.
-Mr. Bron. What is the matter?

1239
01:05:07.041 --> 01:05:10.750
It was the game. The game! My murder game.
We were gonna be having drinks.

1240
01:05:10.833 --> 01:05:13.166
and I thought it'd be fun
to say something dramatic at 10:00.

1241
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:15.625
We were gonna have
20 minutes where… [gasps]

1242
01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:19.041
Blanc. you have to help me.
You have to help me. Help me! Help me!

1243
01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.625
What happens at ten o'clock?

1244
01:05:23.083 --> 01:05:24.750
[systems powering down]

1245
01:05:28.916 --> 01:05:31.041
[Birdie screaming]

1246
01:05:31.916 --> 01:05:34.125
-[Peg] Birdie. listen to my voice.
-[Birdie] Oh my God.

1247
01:05:34.208 --> 01:05:35.625
-Is that you?
-[Peg] Stop screaming.

1248
01:05:35.708 --> 01:05:37.958
-[Birdie] Something touched me!
-[Benoit] Do not panic!

1249
01:05:38.041 --> 01:05:39.583
-[Birdie] It's so dark.
-[Peg] I'm here.

1250
01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:42.125
-Where's my phone? It has a flashlight.
-[Birdie] I can't see.

1251
01:05:42.208 --> 01:05:43.916
-[Benoit] How does this--
-[Claire] Lionel!

1252
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.333
-[Lionel] Claire?
-Everybody…

1253
01:05:45.416 --> 01:05:46.583
-[Lionel] Over here!
-I'm here!

1254
01:05:46.666 --> 01:05:49.583
Stand still. Calm down. Do not panic.

1255
01:05:49.666 --> 01:05:53.250
It was Andi! [panting] It was Andi.

1256
01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:57.166
She killed Duke.
and she tore our room apart. I saw her!

1257
01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:58.916
-What?!
-[Claire] Is that a speargun?

1258
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.666
No. Not today!

1259
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:03.458
[Birdie] Wait. wait. wait.

1260
01:06:03.541 --> 01:06:05.833
-[Benoit] Mr. Bron!
-[Claire] What the hell is happening?

1261
01:06:05.916 --> 01:06:08.541
Oh. hell's bells!
Just. everybody. just stay here!

1262
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.333

[footsteps]

1264
01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.791
[Peg] Aha! Here's my phone!

1265
01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:32.958
Birdie? Lionel? Guys?

1266
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Andi?

1267
01:06:44.666 --> 01:06:45.666
[Benoit] Andi!

1268

[footsteps running]

1270
01:06:54.208 --> 01:06:55.625
Who's that?

1271
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:04.666
Oh. Lord help us.

1272
01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:10.416
[footsteps approaching]

1273
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:13.583

-[grunts]
-[panting]

1275
01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:16.750
Now listen. did you take Duke's gun?

1276
01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:18.916
Why would I take Duke's gun?
Why are the lights out?

1277
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.333
-Duke is dead.
-What?

1278
01:07:37.291 --> 01:07:38.291
I don't understand.

1279
01:07:38.375 --> 01:07:42.000
Please. Trust me. It's all in plain sight.

1280
01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:46.833
We only need one last piece
of information. but only you can--

1281
01:07:46.916 --> 01:07:47.916
[gunshot]

1282
01:07:55.875 --> 01:07:57.000
[glass shield thuds]

1283
01:07:58.416 --> 01:07:59.791
[Claire] Lionel? Lionel?

1284
01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:02.666
[Peg] Guys? Where are you?

1285
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:04.375
[Miles] I'm here! What happened?

1286
01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:06.333
-[Claire] Did you hear that?
-[Miles] Guys?

1287
01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.541
[Lionel] I heard it from here.
Everybody all right?

1288
01:08:08.625 --> 01:08:09.541
[Miles] What was that?

1289
01:08:09.625 --> 01:08:12.958
[Peg] Was that a gunshot?
It sounded like a gunshot.

1290
01:08:17.958 --> 01:08:19.375
[systems powering up]

1291
01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:31.875
[knife clatters]

1292
01:08:47.708 --> 01:08:48.916
Oh. God.

[screams. whimpers]

1295
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.791
[Benoit] Everyone. Inside.

1296
01:09:03.875 --> 01:09:06.083
-Shouldn't we--
-She's not going anywhere.

1297
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.500
It's time to finish this.

1298
01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:19.333
Peg. radio the mainland.
Tell them to send the boats now.

1299
01:09:19.416 --> 01:09:22.416
Banksy be damned!
Beach them if they have to!

1300
01:09:24.416 --> 01:09:27.250
-She killed Duke. Why would she--
-No.

1301
01:09:29.125 --> 01:09:30.500
It makes no sense.

1302
01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:31.958
It all makes perfect sense.

1303
01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:34.625
Duke. Andi. this weekend.

1304
01:09:34.708 --> 01:09:38.458
this ridiculous game that started
well before we set foot on this island.

1305
01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:41.708
Will you explain it to us then. detective?

1306
01:09:41.791 --> 01:09:45.208
No. I can peel back the layers.

1307
01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:49.750
I can take it to a point.
but what lies at the center.

1308
01:09:51.416 --> 01:09:55.458
only one person can tell us
who killed Cassandra Brand.

1309
01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:58.625
[gentle piano music playing]

1310
01:10:01.958 --> 01:10:02.875
[knock on door]

1311
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:08.916
[Benoit] Get that. would ya?

1312
01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:12.375
[Phillip] You're not in the bath again.
are you?

1313
01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:13.708
[Benoit hesitates] No!

1314
01:10:14.416 --> 01:10:15.458
[door unlocking]

1315
01:10:18.458 --> 01:10:19.416
Yep?

1316
01:10:20.958 --> 01:10:21.791
Uh…

1317
01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:24.375
Can I help you?

1318
01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:27.541
[in Southern accent]
Yes. is this Benoit Blanc's residence?

1319
01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:29.875
Um. what is this regarding?

1320
01:10:29.958 --> 01:10:34.250
Well. his office was closed.
and I really need to speak with him.

1321
01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:36.416
It's urgent. Please.

1322
01:10:38.208 --> 01:10:40.833
Blanc! There's someone here for you.

1323
01:10:42.583 --> 01:10:43.583
With a box!

1324
01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.166
[Benoit chuckles] Oh my.

1325
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:52.625
Well. why don't we start at the beginning?

1326
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:58.208
My name is Helen Brand.
and I came all the way here from Alabama.

1327
01:10:59.791 --> 01:11:02.458
Well. what do you do in Alabama?

1328
01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:06.333
I teach. Third grade. Do a lot of Zooming.

1329
01:11:07.291 --> 01:11:10.500
We've been getting into tie-dying a lot
and all this pandemic stuff.

1330
01:11:12.458 --> 01:11:14.416
Okay. none of that really matters.

1331
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.625
Mr. Blanc. two days ago.
I received a call.

1332
01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:19.833
My twin sister committed suicide.

1333
01:11:22.208 --> 01:11:23.458
<i>In her car.</i>

1334
01:11:26.333 --> 01:11:27.583
<i>In her garage.</i>

1335
01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:31.750
<i>With the engine running.</i>

1336
01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:39.541
My sister was Cassandra Brand.
Do you know who she was?

1337
01:11:39.625 --> 01:11:45.333
Yes. of course. I'm sorry. you…
I thought you looked familiar. [chuckles]

1338
01:11:46.458 --> 01:11:48.500
Impressive woman. your sister.

1339
01:11:49.958 --> 01:11:52.833
You know. she kept a journal
every day of her life

1340
01:11:52.916 --> 01:11:54.625
since she was six years old.

1341
01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:56.666
You know what she called it?

1342
01:11:57.416 --> 01:12:02.291
"Notes For Future Biographers."
Biographers. Plural.

1343
01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:04.791
-The girl was six years old.
-[chuckles]

1344
01:12:04.875 --> 01:12:07.333
Then the day after high school.
she shot off to New York.

1345
01:12:07.416 --> 01:12:08.708
and she just never looked back.

1346
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.791
[laughs] You know. when we were kids.

1347
01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:13.791
we goofed together.
and we'd do this character. Rich Bitch.

1348
01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:18.375
"Heavens. the dog ate the caviar again."

1349
01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:20.083
[chuckles]

1350
01:12:20.166 --> 01:12:22.916
Then I hear her doing a talk.
and that's exactly how she sounded.

1351
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.083
Rich Bitch! And I'm like.
"Who are you fooling. girl? Not me!"

1352
01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:29.416
She had the guts and brains
for both of us.

1353
01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.625
and I was just happy watching her.
you know?

1354
01:12:32.291 --> 01:12:35.416
So you. um… You get the call…

1355
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.916
Yeah. yeah. I get the call and I fly in.
This was yesterday.

1356
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.958
And then I go to Andi's house.
I'm cleaning it out. It's a mess.

1357
01:12:43.041 --> 01:12:44.708
All of her books everywhere.

1358
01:12:44.791 --> 01:12:47.875
And I'm just thinking about
what was taken from my sister.

1359
01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:49.875
how I wasn't there for her.

1360
01:12:49.958 --> 01:12:53.625
And I'm getting angrier and angrier.
and then I just hear a knock at the door.

1361
01:12:53.708 --> 01:12:57.041
and it's some courier
with this thing from Miles Bron.

1362
01:12:57.583 --> 01:12:59.958
And I'm sure there's
some clever way to open it.

1363
01:13:00.041 --> 01:13:02.000
I don't know. I just open it.

1364
01:13:02.083 --> 01:13:03.458
And it's an invitation

1365
01:13:03.958 --> 01:13:06.791
to his private island in Greece
for next weekend.

1366
01:13:06.875 --> 01:13:10.833
One of those little trips she'd go on
with him and his group of shitheads.

1367
01:13:10.916 --> 01:13:13.708
They like to call themselves
"The Disruptors."

1368
01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:19.083
But I knew who they were.
and I told her who they were. Shitheads.

1369
01:13:21.416 --> 01:13:22.333
[sighs]

1370
01:13:22.416 --> 01:13:26.208
Miss Brand. what can I do for you?

1371
01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:29.750
Andi didn't commit suicide.

1372
01:13:29.833 --> 01:13:30.916
[dramatic music plays]

1373
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.791
[Helen] She didn't leave any note.

1374
01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:35.875
So I went on her computer.
and I looked in her email.

1375
01:13:35.958 --> 01:13:38.541
her sent messages.
to see if she wrote anybody anything.

1376
01:13:38.625 --> 01:13:44.166
And look. She sent this at 4:00 p.m..
the day she was murdered. four days ago.

1377
01:13:45.166 --> 01:13:46.666
"I finally found it."

1378
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:51.083
"It's right here. and I'm going to use it
to burn his whole empire down."

1379
01:13:51.166 --> 01:13:53.875
"I'm giving you all one last chance
to make things right."

1380
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.958
"You know where to find me. A."

1381
01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:01.958
And I'm assuming
all of these names here are--

1382
01:14:02.041 --> 01:14:05.916
Birdie Jay. Duke Cody.
Claire Debella and Lionel Toussaint.

1383
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.125
The Shitheads.

1384
01:14:07.625 --> 01:14:10.541
She sends that email.
nobody writes back anything.

1385
01:14:10.625 --> 01:14:13.333
and then the next day.
she's dead in the garage

1386
01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:15.125
with sleeping pills in her system?

1387
01:14:16.416 --> 01:14:19.458
I searched every inch
of every room in her house.

1388
01:14:19.541 --> 01:14:21.291
and guess what wasn't there?

1389
01:14:23.916 --> 01:14:24.958
The red envelope.

1390
01:14:27.916 --> 01:14:28.916
Compelling.

1391
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:32.625
Google said you are
the world's greatest detective.

1392
01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:34.583
Somebody like me.
takes something like this

1393
01:14:34.666 --> 01:14:37.666
about a group of rich folk
with an army full of lawyers--

1394
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:39.583
But if one was to get 'em alone.

1395
01:14:40.791 --> 01:14:44.666
isolated for a weekend with.
in your words.

1396
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:47.000
the world's greatest detective…

1397
01:14:49.458 --> 01:14:51.375
You wanna hire me to go to that island.

1398
01:14:51.458 --> 01:14:53.041
It's a stupid idea. right?

1399
01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:55.166
Listen. I want to be clear. huh?

1400
01:14:55.916 --> 01:14:57.291
I am not Batman.

1401
01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:59.875
I can find you the truth.
I can gather evidence.

1402
01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:03.291
I can present it to the police
and the courts. but… [scoffs]

1403
01:15:03.375 --> 01:15:05.416
…that is where my jurisdiction ends.

1404
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:09.166
Yeah. but it's you doing it instead of me.
I'll take those odds.

1405
01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:11.791
I've not seen
your sister's death in the news.

1406
01:15:11.875 --> 01:15:14.250
-Did you release a statement?
-[Helen] No.

1407
01:15:14.333 --> 01:15:15.833
Shit. Was I supposed to?

1408
01:15:16.875 --> 01:15:18.291
I don't know how this works.

1409
01:15:18.375 --> 01:15:21.833
And you have no other family member
who was informed of the death and…

1410
01:15:22.666 --> 01:15:25.250
Oh. if I pulled a few strings.

1411
01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:29.000
I could keep it from leaking
to the press for another… week?

1412
01:15:29.083 --> 01:15:30.583
Maybe. that's…

1413
01:15:31.833 --> 01:15:32.666
Oh.

1414
01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:35.875
No. that's outrageous. That wouldn't…

1415
01:15:38.041 --> 01:15:39.041
Well. now…

1416
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:44.000
Wow. No. that… Yes. Miss Brand.

1417
01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:50.041
Any feelings of reverence or respect
that you had for me

1418
01:15:50.125 --> 01:15:53.666
when you crossed my threshold.
buttress those feelings now.

1419
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:54.625
Buttress them.

1420
01:15:56.291 --> 01:16:02.083
I am proposing
that you come with me to that island

1421
01:16:03.166 --> 01:16:04.333
as your sister.

1422
01:16:05.416 --> 01:16:07.125
As Cassandra Brand.

1423
01:16:08.166 --> 01:16:12.458
What? No.
No. no. no. I'm hiring you to go.

1424
01:16:13.416 --> 01:16:15.958
I… I'm not… Are you insane?

1425
01:16:16.041 --> 01:16:17.666
Buttress now. Yes.

1426
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:19.583
A famous detective shows up

1427
01:16:19.666 --> 01:16:23.083
and out of the blue.
starts poking the subject of your sister.

1428
01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:24.833
they'll shut up like a clam.

1429
01:16:25.875 --> 01:16:30.541
Your presence on that island
is the essential catalyst.

1430
01:16:30.625 --> 01:16:32.625
-Oh. no. come on. man.
-Buttress.

1431
01:16:32.708 --> 01:16:36.000
Yeah. I'm trying real hard to buttress.
but this sounds nuts.

1432
01:16:36.083 --> 01:16:38.250
But it is the only way that this works.

1433
01:16:38.333 --> 01:16:41.750
Look at me.
They'll know instantly that I'm not her.

1434
01:16:41.833 --> 01:16:44.083
You'll cut your hair.
You'll wear her clothes.

1435
01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:46.416
Oh. you really think
I can fit into that shit?

1436
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:49.041
-And what about my hair?
-I know a guy.

1437
01:16:49.125 --> 01:16:51.333
Now. why would anyone suspect

1438
01:16:51.416 --> 01:16:55.625
you showing up. playing your sister.
when they don't know your sister is dead?

1439
01:16:58.791 --> 01:16:59.666
[Helen] Right.

1440
01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:01.916
They don't know Andi is dead.

1441
01:17:03.541 --> 01:17:05.333
So why would they suspect anything?

1442
01:17:07.208 --> 01:17:11.375
-And you'll do the inspecting?
-Yes. I will. You just have to be there.

1443
01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:16.958
Mr. Blanc. is… Is this safe?

1444
01:17:19.166 --> 01:17:20.083
No. No.

1445
01:17:21.166 --> 01:17:23.625
One person will know the truth about you.

1446
01:17:24.375 --> 01:17:26.083
From the moment you arrive on that island.

1447
01:17:26.166 --> 01:17:28.916
the killer will know who you are
and what you are doing.

1448
01:17:29.416 --> 01:17:32.458
And they certainly wouldn't hesitate
to kill again if it covers their tracks.

1449
01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:36.708
I'm… I'm a detective. Helen.
I'm not a bodyguard.

1450
01:17:37.541 --> 01:17:40.041
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

1451
01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:42.250
No.

1452
01:17:44.583 --> 01:17:48.125
One of those shitheads killed my sister.

1453
01:17:53.458 --> 01:17:56.166
Do you really think
we can get the son of a bitch?

1454
01:17:56.250 --> 01:17:57.750
[suspenseful music playing]

1455
01:18:00.541 --> 01:18:02.083
[music continues]

1456
01:18:24.541 --> 01:18:25.750
Well. my goodness.

1457
01:18:25.833 --> 01:18:30.750
I shouldn't be here. This is nuts.
But I'm here. So let's do this.

1458
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:34.000
-Drink?
-You need a drink.

1459
01:18:34.083 --> 01:18:36.000
Oh. no. I don't drink.
I'll have some coffee.

1460
01:18:36.083 --> 01:18:37.041
[waiter] All right.

1461
01:18:37.541 --> 01:18:38.500
Andi's journals.

1462
01:18:38.583 --> 01:18:42.375
Good. you keep studying them.
Okay. so… Tomorrow.

1463
01:18:42.958 --> 01:18:44.125
I'll get there early.

1464
01:18:44.208 --> 01:18:47.541
Really lay on some Southern hokum.
get them all off guard.

1465
01:18:47.625 --> 01:18:50.166
On the boat… be cold.

1466
01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:51.458
Don't engage in conversation.

1467
01:18:51.541 --> 01:18:53.583
-Okay. I'm not great on boats.
-Oh. you'll be fine.

1468
01:18:53.666 --> 01:18:57.083
Just remember. Rich Bitch voice.
Andi posture.

1469
01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:00.666
I have all of her TED Talks on this.
and I've been studying 'em.

1470
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:01.916
Good.

1471
01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:05.958
-[in stately tone] The dog ate the caviar.
-There you go.

1472
01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:07.375
Yeah.

1473
01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:08.958
[in Southern accent] So. you said

1474
01:19:09.041 --> 01:19:11.041
you were gonna be researching
these folks for motive.

1475
01:19:11.125 --> 01:19:12.333
Did you find anything?

1476
01:19:12.416 --> 01:19:13.625
Yes. I did.

1477
01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:17.166
But motives for each of them
to want Miles Bron dead.

1478
01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:20.083
Now why would they
kill her to protect him?

1479
01:19:20.166 --> 01:19:21.375
I just don't get it.

1480
01:19:21.458 --> 01:19:24.166
What about Miles? What if he just did it?

1481
01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:28.375
Well. we can't rule it out.
but Miles Bron is not an idiot.

1482
01:19:29.125 --> 01:19:32.375
To risk committing murder
after a very public court case.

1483
01:19:32.458 --> 01:19:35.083
with the possibility
of that email of Andi's coming to light.

1484
01:19:35.166 --> 01:19:37.916
would be an exceedingly
stupid thing to do.

1485
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.291
Especially if someone
was willing to do it for him.

1486
01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:42.416
Come on. Walk me through these journals.

1487
01:19:43.083 --> 01:19:44.000
Okay.

1488
01:19:44.541 --> 01:19:47.208
About ten years ago.
before they all hit it big.

1489
01:19:47.291 --> 01:19:48.833
<i>they used to hang together at this bar.</i>

1490
01:19:48.916 --> 01:19:50.875
[Benoit] <i>And Miles was leader of the pack?</i>

1491
01:19:50.958 --> 01:19:52.166
[Helen] <i>No. Andi was.</i>

1492
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:54.250
<i>They were all friends with Andi.</i>

1493
01:19:54.833 --> 01:19:56.625
<i>Birdie was a washed-up model.</i>

1494
01:19:56.708 --> 01:20:00.000
<i>Duke was a nerd</i>
<i>doing video game tournaments.</i>

1495
01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:02.166
<i>Claire just lost a race for city council.</i>

1496
01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:04.291
<i>Lionel was a substitute teacher.</i>

1497
01:20:04.375 --> 01:20:06.541
<i>All of them run aground in their thirties.</i>

1498
01:20:06.625 --> 01:20:09.500
<i>But Andi saw their potentials.</i>
<i>She found them all.</i>

1499
01:20:09.583 --> 01:20:10.583
-Hi!
-Hey!

1500
01:20:10.666 --> 01:20:13.333
[Helen] <i>Then she found Miles.</i>
<i>Introduced him to the group.</i>

1501
01:20:13.416 --> 01:20:14.958
This is Miles.

1502
01:20:15.041 --> 01:20:16.708
-Hey. nice to meet you.
-Hey. bro.

1503
01:20:16.791 --> 01:20:17.833
[Claire] I love your hair.

1504
01:20:17.916 --> 01:20:19.666
[Helen] <i>At first. nobody liked him.</i>

1505
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:20.916
[Miles] …outlive the person…

1506
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.125
[Helen] <i>He'd say stuff like…</i>

1507
01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:24.458
I want to be responsible for something

1508
01:20:24.541 --> 01:20:28.291
that gets talked about in the same breath
as the <i>Mona Lisa.</i> Forever.

1509
01:20:28.375 --> 01:20:30.708
What does that even mean?

1510
01:20:30.791 --> 01:20:32.291
It just means immortality.

1511
01:20:32.375 --> 01:20:35.125
He wants to create something
that feels lasting. that feels--

1512
01:20:35.208 --> 01:20:37.791
His first venture was Moviefone
for foot massages.

1513
01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:39.666
-Did it work?
-[Lionel] No!

1514
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:41.583
Okay. listen. let's just roll with it.

1515
01:20:41.666 --> 01:20:44.333
Let's humor him. Let's see where it goes.
Let's see what happens.

1516
01:20:44.416 --> 01:20:46.875
-Hey. team.
<i>-</i>[Helen] <i>And things started happening.</i>

1517
01:20:46.958 --> 01:20:48.625
[screams]

1518
01:20:48.708 --> 01:20:51.666
[Helen] <i>He got Birdie a show</i>
<i>for her designs. It did well.</i>

1519
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:55.041
<i>Got Lionel published.</i>
<i>Duke set up at Twitch.</i>

1520
01:20:55.125 --> 01:20:56.750
<i>Claire elected locally.</i>

1521
01:20:56.833 --> 01:20:58.250
…at you. I love you back!

1522
01:20:58.333 --> 01:21:01.000
[Helen] <i>You know. small stuff.</i>
<i>but it happened.</i>

1523
01:21:02.375 --> 01:21:04.375
<i>And then the big thing happened.</i>

1524
01:21:05.958 --> 01:21:07.250
What is that you're working on?

1525
01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:08.958
<i>♪ He told me ♪</i>

1526
01:21:09.041 --> 01:21:11.250
<i>♪ Let the children lose it ♪</i>

1527
01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.458
<i>♪ Let the children use it ♪</i>

1528
01:21:13.541 --> 01:21:15.416
<i>♪ Let all the children boogie ♪</i>

1529
01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.916
So based on the napkin idea.
Andi and Miles created Alpha.

1530
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.375
It blows up.
They bring everyone along for the ride.

1531
01:21:22.375 --> 01:21:24.625
Miles' aspirations
keep getting bigger and bigger.

1532
01:21:24.708 --> 01:21:25.916
Cut to two years ago.

1533
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.166
Miles meets
some sketchy Norwegian scientist

1534
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.583
at an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru

1535
01:21:30.666 --> 01:21:33.166
who sells him
on this whole new hydrogen fuel.

1536
01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:36.541
-Hmm.
-He becomes obsessed.

1537
01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:40.583
And he's willing to give the company's
entire resources to launch this thing.

1538
01:21:42.041 --> 01:21:43.041
No.

1539
01:21:43.125 --> 01:21:46.666
Andi. Andi. come on. This is it!

1540
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:50.583
No. no. no. This is not a start-up.
This could blow up the world.

1541
01:21:50.666 --> 01:21:51.500
Yeah.

1542
01:21:51.583 --> 01:21:54.416
No! Literally. Miles.
This could blow up the world!

1543
01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.333
[sighs]

1544
01:21:55.416 --> 01:22:00.583
The reality-distortion field ends here.
I can't let you do this.

1545
01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:04.208
What… What do you mean you can't let me?

1546
01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:05.750
I'll walk.

1547
01:22:06.333 --> 01:22:09.750
And I'll take half the company
to stop you from using it for this.

1548
01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:13.166
And she did it.
And. God. I love that she did it.

1549
01:22:13.916 --> 01:22:16.750
Then she found out Miles
had the lawyers work the contract

1550
01:22:16.833 --> 01:22:18.541
so she was cut out the company completely.

1551
01:22:18.625 --> 01:22:20.375
So she sued over that?

1552
01:22:20.458 --> 01:22:21.833
Her whole case was based on

1553
01:22:21.916 --> 01:22:25.250
intellectual ownership
of the company's founding idea.

1554
01:22:25.833 --> 01:22:27.250
Her idea on the napkin.

1555
01:22:28.083 --> 01:22:29.750
Which she didn't keep.

1556
01:22:29.833 --> 01:22:33.666
Miles was very excited. He had an idea.

1557
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:35.625
Uh. so he grabbed a napkin.

1558
01:22:35.708 --> 01:22:40.208
and he. uh. he scribbled
something on it to show us.

1559
01:22:40.291 --> 01:22:44.166
-That's a lie! Your Honor. it's a lie.
-[judge] Order! Counsel. get your client--

1560
01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:46.958
[Andi] Look me in the eye. Claire!
You know it's a lie!

1561
01:22:47.625 --> 01:22:48.708
It's a lie.

1562
01:22:48.791 --> 01:22:49.875
[camera shutters clicking]

1563
01:22:49.958 --> 01:22:53.666
[lawyer] And do you recall. Mr. Cody.
who wrote this napkin?

1564
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:54.833
Yeah. Miles.

1565
01:22:55.541 --> 01:22:57.583
Uh. it was Miles.

1566
01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:00.083
Miles.

1567
01:23:03.333 --> 01:23:04.291
[Helen] <i>This was March.</i>

1568
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:07.250
<i>And right after the verdict.</i>

1569
01:23:07.333 --> 01:23:10.541
<i>Miles suddenly found the napkin</i>
<i>written in his handwriting</i>

1570
01:23:10.625 --> 01:23:12.958
<i>and did all those interviews about it.</i>

1571
01:23:13.041 --> 01:23:15.041
[Benoit] <i>A bald-faced fabrication.</i>

1572
01:23:15.125 --> 01:23:19.083
A damn lie. and it worked.

1573
01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:21.208
[dramatic music playing]

1574
01:23:22.041 --> 01:23:23.125
[grunts]

1575
01:23:54.708 --> 01:23:59.333
So… every one of The Disruptors
perjured themselves

1576
01:23:59.416 --> 01:24:02.375
to destroy Andi and shield Miles Bron.

1577
01:24:02.458 --> 01:24:06.666
We… You and I.
we need to find out why. Motive.

1578
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:10.458
Whose was strong enough
to go one step further and commit murder?

1579
01:24:10.541 --> 01:24:12.250
And then. this will be tricky.

1580
01:24:12.333 --> 01:24:15.625
everyone's whereabouts
on the night of her death.

1581
01:24:15.708 --> 01:24:19.666
Who could have been
at Andi's house that night? Opportunity.

1582
01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:24.083
-Our suspects. motive. opportunity… Hey!
-Mm-hmm.

1583
01:24:25.041 --> 01:24:27.500
-This kinda looks like that <i>Clue</i> notepad.
-Yes. yes. yes.

1584
01:24:27.583 --> 01:24:29.125
You must be really great at <i>Clue.</i> huh?

1585
01:24:29.208 --> 01:24:32.458
I'm very bad at dumb things.
My Achilles' heel.

1586
01:24:32.541 --> 01:24:35.541
Ticking boxes. running around.
searching all the rooms.

1587
01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:37.375
It's just a terrible. terrible game.

1588
01:24:37.458 --> 01:24:39.666
Well. my students love it.

1589
01:24:44.916 --> 01:24:45.791
I'm scared.

1590
01:24:48.791 --> 01:24:49.875
I understand.

1591
01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:55.125
This is your last chance to back out.

1592
01:25:04.958 --> 01:25:06.750
[dramatic music playing]

1593
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:15.375
[grunts softly]

1594
01:25:15.458 --> 01:25:18.791
Oh. God. Boats.

1595
01:25:20.375 --> 01:25:21.458
[Duke whistles]

1596
01:25:23.916 --> 01:25:25.000
Ballsy move.

1597
01:25:26.041 --> 01:25:27.625
[Birdie] You shouldn't be here.

1598
01:25:36.583 --> 01:25:40.916
Duke and Birdie. I think they're onto me.
Or they were just being assholes.

1599
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.583
Well. that's not mutually exclusive.

1600
01:25:42.666 --> 01:25:45.041
Now. look. I suspect.
when we're all settling in.

1601
01:25:45.125 --> 01:25:47.916
Bron's going to pull me aside
to explain my presence.

1602
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.958
That is your chance to snoop.

1603
01:25:50.041 --> 01:25:50.875
Snoop?

1604
01:25:51.916 --> 01:25:52.916
Snoop.

1605
01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:56.833
[suspenseful music playing]

1606
01:25:56.916 --> 01:25:59.166
Snooping. Snoop.

1607
01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:02.791
Okay. here we go.

1608
01:26:13.875 --> 01:26:16.166
-[Whiskey] Hey.
-[Helen. in stately tone] Hi.

1609
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:17.125
Andi.

1610
01:26:18.375 --> 01:26:19.333
Yes.

1611
01:26:19.416 --> 01:26:21.833
I'm Whiskey. We didn't really meet.

1612
01:26:22.916 --> 01:26:25.791
-Are you looking for the pool?
-I am.

1613
01:26:25.875 --> 01:26:28.000
-Do you want to walk?
-Sure.

1614
01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:31.291
Do you want this? I'm not into it.
It smells like that guy Derol.

1615
01:26:32.166 --> 01:26:34.958
That's a beautiful necklace.
You're a Taurus?

1616
01:26:35.041 --> 01:26:37.333
Yeah. Um. Miles got it for me.

1617
01:26:38.583 --> 01:26:41.958
He. um. surprised me for my birthday.

1618
01:26:42.041 --> 01:26:44.750
He filled his entire
penthouse apartment with roses.

1619
01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:45.958
It was very cute.

1620
01:26:47.375 --> 01:26:50.458
He's a really good guy. He's complicated.

1621
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:52.875
But…

1622
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:57.000
I think it's really shitty
what they all did to you.

1623
01:26:57.875 --> 01:26:59.333
And how they all treated you.

1624
01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:01.875
I read your court transcripts.
and you got shanked.

1625
01:27:04.625 --> 01:27:06.041
Thanks. Whiskey.

1626
01:27:06.125 --> 01:27:08.083
Yeah. this is my second one
of these things.

1627
01:27:08.166 --> 01:27:09.458
We did a yacht thing last year.

1628
01:27:09.541 --> 01:27:11.166
Well. that sounds fun.

1629
01:27:11.708 --> 01:27:13.166
[laughs] No.

1630
01:27:13.958 --> 01:27:16.791
I mean. when they're all together.
it's kind of the worst.

1631
01:27:17.291 --> 01:27:20.208
Duke just treats me like arm candy.
and they just ignore me.

1632
01:27:20.291 --> 01:27:22.333
-Why do you put up with it?
-With Duke?

1633
01:27:23.958 --> 01:27:28.208
I'm building my brand. and he's putting me
on his channel more often.

1634
01:27:29.375 --> 01:27:32.750
Though. he's leaning harder right
into this mandom stuff.

1635
01:27:32.833 --> 01:27:35.000
If I'm going to go
into politics eventually.

1636
01:27:35.916 --> 01:27:37.666
I don't think
that's a road I wanna go down.

1637
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:40.500
It's expeditious.
but it's kind of a shitshow.

1638
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:45.041
-Oh. here's the pool.
-I'm gonna walk around a little longer.

1639
01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:46.625
-I'll catch you over there.
-Okay.

1640
01:27:46.708 --> 01:27:49.041
Hey. it's really great
talking to you. Whiskey.

1641
01:27:49.125 --> 01:27:50.041
You too.

1642
01:27:55.708 --> 01:27:58.875
-[male voice over speakers] <i>Dong!</i>
-[gong reverberating]

-[gunshot]
-[Claire] Oh my God!

1644
01:28:01.958 --> 01:28:02.791
[Duke] Really.

1645
01:28:03.916 --> 01:28:04.791
Asshole.

1646
01:28:04.875 --> 01:28:06.625
-[Miles] Now it's a party.
-[grunts]

1647
01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:10.583
I did it. Two weeks ago. I did it.

1648
01:28:11.833 --> 01:28:13.500
You signed off on the power plant.

1649
01:28:13.583 --> 01:28:16.458
Yep. When this thing breaks. poof.

1650
01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:20.375
My whole base is gone.
The grassroots lefties? Gone.

1651
01:28:20.458 --> 01:28:21.833
I did it too.

1652
01:28:21.916 --> 01:28:22.875
Did what?

1653
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:26.208
I signed off on putting Klear
in a manned mission.

1654
01:28:26.291 --> 01:28:28.625
-The staff doesn't know it yet.
-[Claire] Oh. God damn it.

1655
01:28:29.583 --> 01:28:32.500
Let's just pray that
Andi was wrong about this Klear stuff.

1656
01:28:32.583 --> 01:28:34.041
No. she was right.

1657
01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:37.333
You put its gas form
into household piping.

1658
01:28:37.416 --> 01:28:40.291
there's massive leakage into the air.
The hydrogen particles are too small.

1659
01:28:40.375 --> 01:28:41.500
Hydrogen gas?

1660
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:44.416
Lionel. I sold my soul for this.

1661
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.458
You're telling me that it could literally
turn people's homes into the Hindenburg?

1662
01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:57.000
I will take care of him. Don't worry.

1663
01:29:02.583 --> 01:29:04.541
There was a time. you know. back when…

1664
01:29:06.125 --> 01:29:08.458
I was the one on magazines. He was nobody.

1665
01:29:09.291 --> 01:29:11.666
He was this little thing in my hand.

1666
01:29:12.958 --> 01:29:14.291
I preferred that.

1667
01:29:20.083 --> 01:29:22.208
Andi! Hi!

1668
01:29:25.166 --> 01:29:28.958
Wow! No.
[chuckles] You're really good at this.

1669
01:29:29.041 --> 01:29:33.375
This is interesting stuff about Whiskey
and motives for both Lionel and Claire.

1670
01:29:33.458 --> 01:29:34.458
Well done!

1671
01:29:34.541 --> 01:29:37.166
Those were motives?
Because I was kind of confused.

1672
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:39.833
Oh. no. they bet the farm
and will both be ruined

1673
01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:41.750
along with Miles if he fails.

1674
01:29:41.833 --> 01:29:44.250
They need to protect him at all costs.

1675
01:29:44.333 --> 01:29:46.833
But I can't imagine them killing her.
I just can't.

1676
01:29:46.916 --> 01:29:50.500
Think of the crime. the nature of it.

1677
01:29:51.791 --> 01:29:55.500
<i>No. they've come to apologize.</i>
<i>to make amends.</i>

1678
01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:59.750
<i>And the murder itself. it's nonviolent.</i>

1679
01:30:00.708 --> 01:30:01.916
<i>Gentle even.</i>

1680
01:30:04.625 --> 01:30:06.833
<i>They don't even see her die.</i>

1681
01:30:06.916 --> 01:30:07.750
[engine starts]

1682
01:30:08.375 --> 01:30:10.291
[Benoit] <i>She just goes to sleep.</i>

1683
01:30:13.958 --> 01:30:15.250
No. No.

1684
01:30:15.958 --> 01:30:18.000
They're all more than capable.

1685
01:30:19.875 --> 01:30:21.541
[Helen gulping]

1686
01:30:22.625 --> 01:30:24.416
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

1687
01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.333
I thought you said you didn't drink?

1688
01:30:26.416 --> 01:30:29.875
Oh. this? This isn't a drink.
This is some funky health stuff.

1689
01:30:29.958 --> 01:30:31.916
No. you give me that.

1690
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.833
That's hard kombucha.
That's Jared Leto's hard kombucha.

1691
01:30:36.916 --> 01:30:39.416
What is it that? That's 9% alcohol or so…

1692
01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.416
Get off that.
How many of these things you had?

1693
01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:44.083
I don't know. but I feel fine.

1694
01:30:44.833 --> 01:30:46.416
Okay? We need to focus.

1695
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.916
We need to focus. We need
to find the O's. the opportunities.

1696
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.125
We got to open them up. It's time to push.

1697
01:30:52.208 --> 01:30:54.750
No. no. no.
We're not pushing anything right now.

1698
01:30:54.833 --> 01:30:56.833
Listen. I feel good.

1699
01:30:56.916 --> 01:30:58.333
I think maybe you should lie down.

1700
01:30:58.416 --> 01:31:00.375
-We're running out of time. Blanc!
-Helen!

1701
01:31:01.083 --> 01:31:02.083
[softly] Helen…

1702
01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:04.291
Please.

1703
01:31:04.375 --> 01:31:05.916
Think of the danger here.

1704
01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.458
You gotta step back
and let me handle this.

1705
01:31:09.166 --> 01:31:10.208
Push nothing.

1706
01:31:14.125 --> 01:31:15.833
[Miles] <i>They're gonna tell you to stop.</i>

1707
01:31:16.416 --> 01:31:19.833
Even your partner will say.
"You need to stop."

1708
01:31:20.458 --> 01:31:22.458
Because as it turns out.

1709
01:31:22.541 --> 01:31:26.166
nobody wants you to break
the system itself.

1710
01:31:26.916 --> 01:31:29.958
But that is what true disruption is.

1711
01:31:30.625 --> 01:31:34.208
And that is what unites all of us.

1712
01:31:34.291 --> 01:31:37.125
We all got to that line and crossed it.

1713
01:31:40.833 --> 01:31:41.791
[Claire] Andi…

1714
01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.333
Wait! Wait.

1715
01:31:46.666 --> 01:31:49.541
Wait? No. you wait!

1716
01:31:50.458 --> 01:31:53.208
That day in court.
you couldn't even look me in the eye.

1717
01:31:55.708 --> 01:31:57.000
What are you doing?

1718
01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:07.000
You want to talk about the email?

1719
01:32:07.083 --> 01:32:07.916
Oh.

1720
01:32:08.541 --> 01:32:12.958
So now you want to talk about the email?
You didn't even write back.

1721
01:32:13.708 --> 01:32:15.458
I'm a politician.

1722
01:32:15.541 --> 01:32:17.041
I never email anything

1723
01:32:17.125 --> 01:32:20.208
that I wouldn't want to see
on the front page of <i>The Times.</i>

1724
01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:21.583
That's why I called.

1725
01:32:21.666 --> 01:32:22.500
[scoffs]

1726
01:32:23.291 --> 01:32:26.666
We all did.
Right after we got it. over and over.

1727
01:32:27.166 --> 01:32:30.750
You… Your phone was off.
and then the whole next week.

1728
01:32:31.708 --> 01:32:32.875
Yeah. I've got a new number.

1729
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:37.166
And when we couldn't reach you.
I went to your house.

1730
01:32:37.916 --> 01:32:40.125
[Claire] <i>Lionel and I got there</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

1731
01:32:40.208 --> 01:32:41.458
<i>Duke was already there.</i>

1732
01:32:41.541 --> 01:32:43.250
-[Duke] Andi!
-[Lionel] Hey. Andi?

1733
01:32:43.333 --> 01:32:44.375
[Duke] <i>The lights were out.</i>

1734
01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.458
<i>I was pounding so hard.</i>
<i>I almost broke it down.</i>

1735
01:32:46.541 --> 01:32:47.375
Andi!

1736
01:32:49.291 --> 01:32:52.166
We knocked. waited. and called for you.
but after an hour. we left.

1737
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:55.041
Birdie came back later on to check.
It was the same thing.

1738
01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:58.125
-Where the hell were you. Andi?
-What time did you get there?

1739
01:32:58.708 --> 01:33:00.166
I don't know. It was dark.

1740
01:33:01.666 --> 01:33:02.500
And. Duke.

1741
01:33:03.708 --> 01:33:05.166
you were already there?

1742
01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:07.333
He almost got in an accident
on his motorcycle.

1743
01:33:07.416 --> 01:33:08.541
he was driving so fast.

1744
01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:09.875
Andi. I almost got pancaked.

1745
01:33:09.958 --> 01:33:13.208
Okay. okay. Can you say all that
one more time for me. please?

1746
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:15.583
[sighs]

1747
01:33:17.125 --> 01:33:17.958
Look.

1748
01:33:19.291 --> 01:33:22.083
I don't know what you're planning
on pulling being here.

1749
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:24.500
but we need to talk about this.

1750
01:33:25.583 --> 01:33:27.750
If I would've answered
the door that night.

1751
01:33:28.875 --> 01:33:32.333
would you have said.
"I'm sorry. I back you with Miles."

1752
01:33:33.666 --> 01:33:35.625
Or were you just showing up

1753
01:33:35.708 --> 01:33:38.250
so you could stop me
from using that envelope?

1754
01:33:53.083 --> 01:33:54.208
Something's off.

1755
01:33:55.041 --> 01:33:56.166
I don't like it.

1756
01:33:57.208 --> 01:33:58.583
What's she playing at?

1757
01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:02.500
[alarm blaring]

1758
01:34:02.583 --> 01:34:05.208
[automated voice]
<i>Please. keep our water clean. Please…</i>

1759
01:34:05.291 --> 01:34:06.291
[Helen] Blanc!

1760
01:34:06.833 --> 01:34:08.916
[automated voice]
<i>Please. keep our water clean.</i>

1761
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.583
That's everything she said. I think.

1762
01:34:11.666 --> 01:34:14.875
I think maybe you should take up drinking.
You're just killing it.

1763
01:34:14.958 --> 01:34:20.250
Lionel and Claire were never there alone.
But Duke came early and Birdie came late.

1764
01:34:20.333 --> 01:34:22.791
But they could've gotten there early.
killed your sister.

1765
01:34:22.875 --> 01:34:25.916
circled away and then waited
for the other to arrive.

1766
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.166
Shit.

1767
01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:30.583
Something is just teasing the edge
of my brain.

1768
01:34:30.666 --> 01:34:33.791
This… this case confounds me.
It just confounds me.

1769
01:34:33.875 --> 01:34:37.333
We don't have a motive
for Duke or Birdie. so--

1770
01:34:37.416 --> 01:34:39.958
<i>Do either of you two</i>
<i>want to do a session or what?</i>

1771
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:41.750
<i>I'm on the clock.</i>

1772
01:34:44.208 --> 01:34:46.708
No. not right now.

1773
01:34:46.791 --> 01:34:48.125
[fax machine whirring]

1774
01:34:49.541 --> 01:34:50.541
Maybe later.

1775
01:34:50.625 --> 01:34:52.500
<i>All right. It's your money. not mine.</i>

1776
01:34:57.250 --> 01:35:03.333
Ugh. Oh. if I ever meet Jared Leto.
I'm gonna whoop his kombucha-brewing ass.

1777
01:35:03.416 --> 01:35:06.041
One number. All his machines.

1778
01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:10.625
[Helen] Holy shit.

1779
01:35:10.708 --> 01:35:14.375
From that afternoon.
just minutes after Andi sent the email.

1780
01:35:15.041 --> 01:35:16.875
Lionel. Lionel faxed it--

1781
01:35:16.958 --> 01:35:19.666
Now hold on.
it doesn't necessarily mean he… Get down.

1782
01:35:20.291 --> 01:35:22.958
Right now. Go to him.
Do what you gotta do.

1783
01:35:23.041 --> 01:35:26.125
push that son of a bitch.
Just get an answer out of him.

1784
01:35:26.208 --> 01:35:31.750
Look. babe. We really need this.
So do this for me one last time. okay?

1785
01:35:33.333 --> 01:35:35.583
-All right. I love--
-[line disconnects]

1786
01:35:44.041 --> 01:35:45.000
[Miles chuckles]

1787
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:53.666
[Miles moaning]

1788
01:35:54.666 --> 01:35:55.583
[Miles] Come here.

1789
01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:58.833
[rustling]

1790
01:36:09.125 --> 01:36:10.500
Are you gonna do it for me?

1791
01:36:10.583 --> 01:36:12.250
[Miles] Mm-hmm.

1792
01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:13.416
[grunts]

1793
01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:14.333
Not that.

1794
01:36:14.833 --> 01:36:16.083
-Hmm?
-Huh-uh.

1795
01:36:16.666 --> 01:36:18.000
Oh. come on. come on.

1796
01:36:18.083 --> 01:36:20.041
It's all he wants.

1797
01:36:20.125 --> 01:36:22.625
The YouTube channel's dying.
He needs the exposure.

1798
01:36:22.708 --> 01:36:26.958
Just put him on Alpha News. baby.
Just a late-night spot.

1799
01:36:27.041 --> 01:36:30.208
And you know he's earned it.
With what he did.

1800
01:36:30.291 --> 01:36:31.500
[Miles] Listen. listen.

1801
01:36:31.583 --> 01:36:33.875
I am building the future of news.

1802
01:36:33.958 --> 01:36:37.291
I can't have
rhino-horn-boner-pill karma in the mix.

1803
01:36:37.375 --> 01:36:39.375
-[both giggle]
-See? See?

1804
01:36:40.166 --> 01:36:45.333
Like. he is my loyal friend.
but I can't put him on Alpha News. Okay?

1805
01:36:45.416 --> 01:36:46.708
[breathing heavily]

1806
01:36:54.791 --> 01:36:57.041
[Birdie] There's no stopping it. Peg.

1807
01:36:57.125 --> 01:36:58.833
I can't do this anymore. I'm done.

1808
01:36:58.916 --> 01:37:00.791
-Peg!
-Don't. Just don't talk to me!

1809
01:37:00.875 --> 01:37:03.500
-Wait! Peg!
-[Peg] Ten years! Ten years!

1810
01:37:03.583 --> 01:37:05.375
My therapist says
this is a toxic relationship.

1811
01:37:05.458 --> 01:37:07.833
-[Birdie] Don't be like that!
-[Peg] Don't follow me. Birdie!

1812
01:37:07.916 --> 01:37:09.375
I quit! I quit!

1813
01:37:12.208 --> 01:37:14.666
[Birdie] <i>It was a tribute to Beyoncé.</i>
<i>but people…</i>

1814
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:16.083
[fast forwarding]

1815
01:37:16.166 --> 01:37:18.625
[Peg] <i>What did Miles mean.</i>
<i>"This is her only chance"?</i>

1816
01:37:18.708 --> 01:37:20.583
[Birdie] <i>What does anything mean?</i>

1817
01:37:20.666 --> 01:37:23.125
[Peg] <i>I swear to God.</i>
<i>I'll punch you in the face if you do not…</i>

1818
01:37:23.208 --> 01:37:24.166
…tell me!

1819
01:37:24.250 --> 01:37:26.833
I am going to sign the statement.

1820
01:37:26.916 --> 01:37:28.958
No! That will destroy us.
There's no coming--

1821
01:37:29.041 --> 01:37:31.541
The story is gonna break!
There's no stopping it!

1822
01:37:31.625 --> 01:37:33.583
We will do what we always do.

1823
01:37:33.666 --> 01:37:36.916
Deny. half-apologize.
and then go silent awhile.

1824
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.208
I will handle this. You…

1825
01:37:41.708 --> 01:37:42.583
What is this?

1826
01:37:43.416 --> 01:37:44.500
It's my secret phone.

1827
01:37:47.166 --> 01:37:48.083
What is this?

1828
01:37:48.666 --> 01:37:51.791
An email from the Sweetie Pants contractor
two years ago.

1829
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.625
"Miss Jay. I'm writing to inform you
that the proposed Bangladesh factory

1830
01:37:57.708 --> 01:38:00.583
is notoriously one of the world's
biggest sweatshops."

1831
01:38:00.666 --> 01:38:01.833
"Please advise."

1832
01:38:03.291 --> 01:38:07.375
And then you replied.
"Sounds perfect. Thanks."

1833
01:38:08.958 --> 01:38:10.791
With your Memoji dabbing.

1834
01:38:15.916 --> 01:38:16.916
Birdie.

1835
01:38:18.916 --> 01:38:23.666
please tell me you did not think
sweatshops are where they make

1836
01:38:25.416 --> 01:38:27.000
sweatpants.

1837
01:38:30.166 --> 01:38:32.208
Oh my God.

1838
01:38:32.291 --> 01:38:34.666
[sighs] Miles is going to pay me off.

1839
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:37.333
He said if I take full responsibility
for the sweatshops.

1840
01:38:37.416 --> 01:38:39.666
he'll pay me the value of my shares.

to save myself.

1846

That's because it's a terrible game.

1847
01:38:55.041 --> 01:38:57.125
They all had a motive to protect Miles.

1848
01:38:57.208 --> 01:38:59.916
They were all there that night.
So what now. detective?

1849
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:01.833
The envelope.

1850
01:39:02.833 --> 01:39:06.708
Whoever killed your sister
took that envelope to protect Miles.

1851
01:39:06.791 --> 01:39:08.500
and they wouldn't just destroy it.

1852
01:39:08.583 --> 01:39:10.916
They would want him to see
what they'd done for him.

1853
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.875
They brought it here. It's here.

1854
01:39:14.458 --> 01:39:16.250
So how are we supposed to find it?

1855
01:39:16.333 --> 01:39:18.791
Well. unless someone brings
an attaché case to dinner.

1856
01:39:18.875 --> 01:39:21.958
they won't have an envelope
that size on their person.

1857
01:39:24.666 --> 01:39:26.583
They'll have to hide it in their room.

1858
01:39:27.583 --> 01:39:29.541

to us all then. detective?

No. I can peel back the layers.

who killed Cassandra Brand.

through this entire case…

01:48:32.041 --> 01:48:33.333
"Inbreathiate."

1986
01:48:36.458 --> 01:48:37.500
It's not a word.

1987
01:48:38.375 --> 01:48:39.291
What?

1988
01:48:39.375 --> 01:48:42.750
Can we just take a second
and fully inbreathiate this moment?

1989
01:48:43.333 --> 01:48:44.625
It's not a real word.

1990
01:48:44.708 --> 01:48:47.666
It kind of sounds like one.
but it's just entirely made up.

1991
01:48:48.250 --> 01:48:49.333
Now "reclamation."

1992
01:48:49.416 --> 01:48:50.500
now. well. that…

1993
01:48:50.583 --> 01:48:54.416
That is a word. but it's the wrong word.

is remedial at best.

01:49:45.833 --> 01:49:49.875
Look into the clear center
of this Glass Onion…

2012
01:49:52.541 --> 01:49:54.291
Miles Bron is an idiot.

2013
01:49:56.125 --> 01:50:01.541
Oh. please.
Just tell us who tried to kill me.

2014
01:50:01.625 --> 01:50:06.416
Nobody tried to kill you.
you vainglorious buffoon.

2015
01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:09.083
Duke took my glass!

2016
01:50:09.166 --> 01:50:11.041
That's what you told us he did.

2017
01:50:11.958 --> 01:50:15.625
He must've picked it up by mistake.
you told us. right after it happened.

2018
01:50:15.708 --> 01:50:19.291
Look at that dress spin.
Birdie. do that again. Watch this.

2019
01:50:19.375 --> 01:50:21.333
And after you said those words.

2020
01:50:21.416 --> 01:50:24.291
that's what we all remember seeing.
but think!

2021
01:50:25.625 --> 01:50:29.291
Ignore his lies. everyone.
and think clearly now.

2022
01:50:29.375 --> 01:50:32.291
What did we all actually see?

2023
01:50:32.375 --> 01:50:35.208
Wow! Look at that dress spin.
Birdie. that's amazing.

2024
01:50:35.291 --> 01:50:36.333
Just…

2025
01:50:36.416 --> 01:50:40.416
-[gasps]
-[Benoit] You handed Duke your own glass.

2026
01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.875
Clear as crystal.
Right in front of our eyes.

2027
01:50:42.958 --> 01:50:46.666
All of us.
And then told a bald-faced fabrication.

2028
01:50:47.458 --> 01:50:48.625
And it worked.

2029
01:50:49.208 --> 01:50:51.583
Blanc. are you telling us
Miles killed Duke?

2030
01:50:51.666 --> 01:50:53.625
-Yes.
-Why?

2031
01:50:53.708 --> 01:50:56.291
Because the night
Andi sent you all the emails.

2032
01:50:56.375 --> 01:50:59.041
when Duke got to Andi's house
early on his motorcycle…

2033
01:50:59.125 --> 01:51:00.041
[engine revving]

2034
01:51:01.416 --> 01:51:03.041
[Benoit] …<i>he saw Miles leaving.</i>

2035
01:51:04.583 --> 01:51:05.500
[tires screeching]

2036
01:51:06.958 --> 01:51:08.333
[Benoit]<i> Was almost struck by him.</i>

2037
01:51:08.416 --> 01:51:12.041
<i>In fact. he told all of us.</i>
<i>Right out in the open. he told us.</i>

2038
01:51:12.125 --> 01:51:13.541
Iconic.

2039
01:51:14.208 --> 01:51:17.291
Remember that night you almost pancaked me
with it on the road outside of Andi's?

2040
01:51:17.375 --> 01:51:19.250
Anderson Cooper's birthday? Mm-hmm.

2041
01:51:19.333 --> 01:51:21.833
That night. at Andi's.

2042
01:51:22.416 --> 01:51:25.583
That night. Duke told us
he almost got in an accident.

2043
01:51:25.666 --> 01:51:27.083
He… pancaked?

2044
01:51:27.166 --> 01:51:30.250
Yeah. but Miles had been living in Greece
the past six months.

2045
01:51:30.333 --> 01:51:32.125
No. Whiskey.

2046
01:51:33.416 --> 01:51:36.458
Miles saw you
on your birthday in New York.

2047
01:51:36.541 --> 01:51:40.125
Gave you that necklace for your birthday.
And you're a Taurus.

2048
01:51:41.125 --> 01:51:42.208
I am.

2049
01:51:43.375 --> 01:51:44.875
Two weeks ago.

2050
01:51:44.958 --> 01:51:47.125
-[Benoit] Forget the hydrofuels…
-May 9th.

2051
01:51:47.208 --> 01:51:48.125
…and the sweatshops.

2052
01:51:48.208 --> 01:51:51.166
and the consensual cuckolding
for cable news assignments.

2053
01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:52.083
Sorry. what?

2054
01:51:52.166 --> 01:51:53.333
And focus

2055
01:51:55.208 --> 01:51:56.291
on the envelope.

2056
01:52:03.375 --> 01:52:04.458
[screams]

2057
01:52:04.541 --> 01:52:06.791
[gasps] Holy shit!

2058
01:52:10.875 --> 01:52:12.916
What is reality?

2059
01:52:14.208 --> 01:52:15.291
Andi?

2060
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:21.458
[Benoit] Who did the envelope threaten?

2061
01:52:24.541 --> 01:52:25.666
Miles Bron.

2062
01:52:28.083 --> 01:52:33.916
<i>That night. Lionel faxed Andi's email</i>
<i>to Miles who received it in New York.</i>

2063
01:52:34.625 --> 01:52:37.916
<i>The one thing that could destroy</i>
<i>his empire of lies.</i>

2064
01:52:38.666 --> 01:52:42.791
<i>the truth in the hands</i>
<i>of the only person unafraid to tell it.</i>

2065
01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:47.458
<i>So Miles drives his Baby Blue Porsche</i>

2066
01:52:47.541 --> 01:52:50.708
<i>to the scene of the crime.</i>
<i>and Andi lets him in.</i>

2067
01:52:50.791 --> 01:52:51.916
<i>Of course she did.</i>

2068
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.833
<i>Miles' machine of lawyers and power</i>

2069
01:52:54.916 --> 01:52:58.166
<i>could destroy her</i>
<i>through sheer dumb force.</i>

2070
01:52:58.250 --> 01:52:59.791
<i>But Miles himself?</i>

2071
01:52:59.875 --> 01:53:02.250
<i>Oh. she was clever enough</i>
<i>not to fear Miles.</i>

2072
01:53:03.916 --> 01:53:10.208
<i>But she didn't see the real threat.</i>
<i>the obvious threat until it was too late.</i>

2073
01:53:20.291 --> 01:53:24.208
Duke alone knew you were there that night.
but he didn't know Andi was dead.

2074
01:53:24.291 --> 01:53:27.750
No. no. he didn't know that
until this evening.

2075
01:53:27.833 --> 01:53:32.000
Right here.
when he got a Google Alert on his phone.

2076
01:53:32.083 --> 01:53:35.125
which has now fallen strangely silent.

2077
01:53:35.625 --> 01:53:37.000
And which he showed to you…

2078
01:53:38.291 --> 01:53:39.208
[gasps]

2079
01:53:39.291 --> 01:53:41.458
…because you don't own a phone.

2080
01:53:42.041 --> 01:53:43.750
Duke! No!

2081
01:53:48.458 --> 01:53:50.375
Did he really think
he could stop all of them

2082
01:53:50.458 --> 01:53:52.208
from finding out about Andi's death?

2083
01:53:52.291 --> 01:53:53.958
They all have phones.

2084
01:53:54.041 --> 01:53:55.458
-Where's my phone?
-[Birdie] Peggy.

2085
01:53:56.250 --> 01:53:57.791
-Phone!
-Still no.

2086
01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:00.416
[Benoit] He didn't need to hide the death.

2087
01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:03.166
He just needed to hide
that Duke had shown him the death

2088
01:54:03.250 --> 01:54:05.541
<i>moments before he was killed.</i>

2089
01:54:06.541 --> 01:54:08.541
<i>Right out in the open. Duke showed him.</i>

2090
01:54:08.625 --> 01:54:10.333
[Duke] That changes things. right?

2091
01:54:10.416 --> 01:54:11.833
It sure does.

2092
01:54:11.916 --> 01:54:15.000
And told him exactly what he wanted
in return for his silence.

2093
01:54:15.083 --> 01:54:18.375
Numbers like this.
Maybe we can talk Alpha News?

2094
01:54:19.208 --> 01:54:21.208
You bet your ass. Come here.

2095
01:54:22.041 --> 01:54:23.541
So what does Miles do?

2096
01:54:23.625 --> 01:54:25.750
Does he keep a vial of poison
in his tooth or something?

2097
01:54:25.833 --> 01:54:26.916
Is that a rich person thing?

2098
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.666
No. no. no. no. it's just…
It's so much stupider than that.

2099
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:34.666
Birdie. what are the ingredients
to your Cuban Breeze?

2100
01:54:35.291 --> 01:54:38.208
Um. vodka. amaretto.

2101
01:54:38.291 --> 01:54:39.125
Oh. God.

2102
01:54:44.875 --> 01:54:46.708
[Birdie] <i>And… pineapple juice.</i>

2103
01:54:46.791 --> 01:54:49.458
No pineapple in that. right?
Duke don't dance with pineapple.

2104
01:54:50.041 --> 01:54:51.208
An allergy.

2105
01:54:51.291 --> 01:54:52.791
He can't even have a drop.

2106
01:54:52.875 --> 01:54:54.333
Pineapple juice!

2107
01:54:54.833 --> 01:54:58.041
He just put
pineapple juice in his whiskey.

2108
01:54:58.958 --> 01:55:00.375
It's so dumb.

2109
01:55:00.458 --> 01:55:02.791
Oh. it's so dumb. it's brilliant.

2110
01:55:02.875 --> 01:55:05.666
No! It's just dumb!

2111
01:55:06.541 --> 01:55:09.916
"Died of an apparent suicide.
She is survived by her sister. Helen."

2112
01:55:11.208 --> 01:55:12.083
Helen.

2113
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.500
You told me about Helen. your sister--

2114
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.916
[gasps] Oh. wait!

2115
01:55:21.875 --> 01:55:24.291
Helen Brand. ladies and gentlemen.

2116
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.416
And now we come
to Helen's attempted murder.

2117
01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:36.750
which. I have to give you credit for.
did have a sound foundation of thought.

2118
01:55:37.833 --> 01:55:41.333
You realized the opportunity
laid out in front of you.

2119
01:55:41.416 --> 01:55:43.333
You have a house on a remote island.

2120
01:55:43.416 --> 01:55:46.333
<i>filled with desperate people.</i>

2121
01:55:46.416 --> 01:55:51.333
all of whom have a real-life reason
to wish this woman harm. You--

2122
01:55:56.166 --> 01:56:02.500
Furthermore. you have
a loaded gun conveniently within reach.

2123
01:56:05.583 --> 01:56:08.916
And the lights had even been turned off.

2124
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.500
You've taken seven people.

2125
01:56:10.583 --> 01:56:13.208
each of whom has a real-life reason
to wish you harm.

2126
01:56:13.291 --> 01:56:15.583
gathered them together on a remote island.

2127
01:56:15.666 --> 01:56:19.125
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads.

2128
01:56:19.208 --> 01:56:23.166
It's like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights!

2129
01:56:25.083 --> 01:56:26.166
Heavens to…

2130
01:56:27.291 --> 01:56:29.750
You dim-witted. brainless

2131
01:56:30.416 --> 01:56:31.833
jackass!

2132
01:56:32.958 --> 01:56:36.666
Your one murder. with any panache at all.

2133
01:56:37.583 --> 01:56:41.458
and you stole the whole idea from me.

2134
01:56:41.541 --> 01:56:42.750
[dramatic music playing]

2135
01:56:48.166 --> 01:56:49.458
[gunshot]

2136
01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.958
And after all that. you…
You still kept the envelope?

2137
01:57:00.875 --> 01:57:02.500
You didn't burn it or anything?

2138
01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.500
You recognize this?

2139
01:57:06.625 --> 01:57:08.333
Andi's handwriting.

2140
01:57:09.666 --> 01:57:11.166
I got you. son of a bitch.

2141
01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:14.541
Oh. let's slow down there. sister. Okay?

2142
01:57:14.625 --> 01:57:18.375
Because first. how could you
ever prove that that's the original?

2143
01:57:18.458 --> 01:57:20.125
-She might have copied mine.
-No.

2144
01:57:21.041 --> 01:57:23.541
The bar closed nine years ago.

2145
01:57:23.625 --> 01:57:26.625
and hers has one thing
that yours just doesn't.

2146
01:57:34.583 --> 01:57:36.875
Okay. but second…

2147
01:57:39.458 --> 01:57:40.291
[thuds]

2148
01:57:45.916 --> 01:57:48.291
-What the hell did he do?
-He just burned it!

2149
01:57:48.375 --> 01:57:50.375
[Miles] Burned what?
I didn't see anything.

2150
01:57:50.458 --> 01:57:51.416
[Helen] You burned it!

2151
01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:54.041
-Is someone making toast?
-This will not stand.

2152
01:57:54.125 --> 01:57:59.708
Uh-huh. Well. did you see this proof.
this smoking napkin. Blanc?

2153
01:58:01.166 --> 01:58:03.333
No. Did anybody?

2154
01:58:08.583 --> 01:58:10.208
Okay. then wow!

2155
01:58:10.916 --> 01:58:13.750
Wow! We got some big accusations
flying around here.

2156
01:58:14.458 --> 01:58:16.541
Except. everybody seems to have

2157
01:58:16.625 --> 01:58:19.125
a very foggy recollection
of what they actually saw.

2158
01:58:19.208 --> 01:58:22.541
and there's nothing
but totally circumspective evidence.

2159
01:58:22.625 --> 01:58:23.458
[sighs]

2160
01:58:23.541 --> 01:58:27.541
So. if this was just us
playing my murder mystery game.

2161
01:58:27.625 --> 01:58:30.083
which we should have been doing
all weekend.

2162
01:58:30.166 --> 01:58:33.583
then Blanc wins an iPad Pro this time.

2163
01:58:34.625 --> 01:58:36.000
But this is the real world.

2164
01:58:36.666 --> 01:58:40.375
And in the real world. you need
more than a neat. little detective story.

2165
01:58:40.458 --> 01:58:41.958
You need evidence.

2166
01:58:42.041 --> 01:58:45.166
And you've got… nothing.

2167
01:58:45.875 --> 01:58:46.875
Do you?

2168
01:58:54.416 --> 01:58:55.416
He's right.

2169
01:58:57.250 --> 01:59:00.250
The contents of that envelope
and his possession of it

2170
01:59:00.333 --> 01:59:02.583
were our only physical evidence.

2171
01:59:04.375 --> 01:59:05.458
Right.

2172
01:59:08.208 --> 01:59:12.125
Wanna take that to the cops?
You wanna take it to the courts?

2173
01:59:12.208 --> 01:59:13.375
[chuckles]

2174
01:59:13.458 --> 01:59:15.666
Look. you pick your poison.

2175
01:59:16.291 --> 01:59:20.416
Anywhere you go.
it's going to be your word against mine.

2176
01:59:21.250 --> 01:59:22.916
How do you think that's gonna go?

2177
01:59:23.708 --> 01:59:27.416
I think it's gonna go
about like it went for Andi.

2178
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:28.916
Jesus.

2179
01:59:31.541 --> 01:59:33.666
