written all over it.

Sit tight. let me get into it.

All right. I'll see
you at the office.

10
00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:04.952
- Everything okay?

11
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:06.195

cold. your breakfast.

- [Conner] Don't even
think about it. Lori!

16
00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:14.996
- Okay. let's move
you over a little.

17
00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:16.101
- You heard her!

18
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.309
- [Beth] Don't you start.

19
00:02:17.378 --> 00:02:18.931
- [Conner] She's the instigator.

20
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.416
- I am not!

21
00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:21.451
- Honey. you're not
still mad at your dad

22
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.866
for missing your game?

23
00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:24.420
- I don't care. whatever.

24
00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.216
- Yeah. that's the only
word he says. pretty much.

25
00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:28.838
- You know he wants to be there.

26
00:02:28.907 --> 00:02:32.117
- Yeah. and he works
for a real jerk too.

27
00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:33.636
- Where did you hear that?

28
00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:35.879
- Nowhere. I didn't
say anything.

29
00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:38.088
- Lori. what did I
tell you about that?

30
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.918
You know better.

31
00:02:39.987 --> 00:02:41.575
- Honey. this looks amazing.

32
00:02:42.886 --> 00:02:44.336
You look hot. by the way.

33
00:02:45.026 --> 00:02:46.614
- You think so?

34
00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:49.341
- Absolutely. and I
got us a reservation

35
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.860
at your favorite restaurant.

36
00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.414
I'm gonna make it up to
you this time without fail.

37
00:02:53.483 --> 00:02:56.555
Most of the things. I can't
talk about in front of you kids.

38
00:02:56.624 --> 00:02:58.108
- Daddy. when are
we going camping?

39
00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.939
I drew a map so
we won't get lost.

40
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:03.010
- Ooh. love the bear.

41
00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.667
Soon. very soon. I promise.

42
00:03:04.736 --> 00:03:05.392
- Yes!

43
00:03:05.461 --> 00:03:06.807
- He's bluffing!

44
00:03:08.326 --> 00:03:09.982
- Don't wait up for your mother.

45
00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:11.984
- Don't wait up for what?

46
00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:13.193
- Gotta go. I'm late.

47
00:03:13.262 --> 00:03:14.746
- Are you sure you're off.

48
00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:16.920
because I can make other
plans with the girls.

49
00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.303
- Have I ever not kept my word?

50
00:03:20.372 --> 00:03:21.891
- You serious?

51
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.758
- Do you really want me
to answer that question?

[kettle whistling]

53
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:38.770
- Hey. you got my message.

54
00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:39.840
Can you grab a seat?

55
00:03:40.944 --> 00:03:42.187
- Nice to see you here.

56
00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:43.982
- Ah.

57
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:45.155
- What'd you want me to say?

58
00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.743
- Actually. I want
you to listen.

59
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.920
Apparently. there's been some
new questions about Lancer.

60
00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.542
I got a call from up top.

61
00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:53.854
- Lancer's being investigated
and we're gonna be audited.

62
00:03:53.923 --> 00:03:54.717
Got the call too.

63
00:03:55.856 --> 00:03:56.650
Thank you.

64
00:03:58.134 --> 00:03:59.031
What's the matter?

65
00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.756
You look concerned.

66
00:04:00.757 --> 00:04:01.862
Parched?

67
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:03.001
- I'm not on trial here.

68
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.658
- No. no. not yet.

69
00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.039
- Explain something to you.

70
00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:09.628
Do you have any idea
how much litigation

71
00:04:09.697 --> 00:04:12.321
we have to go through to
keep a company like Lancer

72
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.219
in business. who's
involved with more debts

73
00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:16.325
than. let me think. the plague?

74
00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:19.017
"Hey. we're comin' up
with the cure for cancer!"

75
00:04:19.086 --> 00:04:21.261
It's a smoke screen.
over and over again.

76
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.023
and they got the stones to come
after us for double billing?

77
00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:26.783
Double billing.
are you kiddin' me?

78
00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:29.096
When the whole stinkin'
board should be locked up

79
00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:31.409
and rot in federal prison
for the last 20 years?

80
00:04:31.478 --> 00:04:33.859
If it wasn't for us. if
it wasn't for what I did.

81
00:04:33.928 --> 00:04:35.861
you know what. I don't
think I can keep up

82
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:36.966
with these people.

83
00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:39.589
Fraud. embezzlement. negligence!

84
00:04:39.658 --> 00:04:42.937
Trust me. I have washed these
people clean over and over

85
00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:45.492
and over again to make
them whiter than snow.

86
00:04:45.561 --> 00:04:48.218
And I'm gonna tell
ya somethin'. buddy.

87
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.497
You can't put a
price tag on that!

88
00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:53.948
- I hear you. I'll look into it.

89
00:04:54.017 --> 00:04:55.191
- Yeah. you will look into it.

90
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.813
and then you'll
answer only to me.

91
00:04:58.021 --> 00:05:00.092
- Okay. and when I button
this all up for you.

92
00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:03.095
I have to have
that vacation time.

93
00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:05.063
I've been promising my two kids.

94
00:05:05.132 --> 00:05:06.547
Come on. I need this.

95
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:08.929
- Are you kiddin' me?

96
00:05:09.964 --> 00:05:12.208
You got one family to
worry about right now.

97
00:05:12.277 --> 00:05:13.692
They're this business.

98
00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:16.799
This job is all you need
to take care of right now.

99
00:05:18.663 --> 00:05:21.148
I think it's time to put
your head in the game. man.

[pensive music]

101
00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.713

about this. Doug.

102

- Appreciate that. Janet.

103
00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:38.510
- Good luck.

104
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.581
- Right.

105
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.102
- Hey. if China sweeps
in like they say.

106
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:46.932
I'll probably be out there
lookin' for work too.

107
00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:49.349
- Thanks.

108
00:05:49.418 --> 00:05:52.559
[soft pensive music]

109
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.140
- This is even less
than the last one!

110
00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:24.384
- So who wants Chick-fil-A?

111
00:06:26.489 --> 00:06:28.318
Well. I think that
settles it then.

112
00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:31.598
- You know we can't
afford to be eating out.

113
00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.946
- I'm gonna buy my
daughter some lunch.

114
00:06:38.846 --> 00:06:42.402
[dramatic pensive music]

115
00:07:39.251 --> 00:07:42.151
- [sighs] You don't
have to act like this

116
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.842
to get what you want.

117
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:48.295
- Mom. you've told me
this a thousand times.

118
00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:51.505
- Hey. you're better than this.

119
00:07:51.574 --> 00:07:54.059
- I don't need
you to control me!

120
00:07:55.233 --> 00:07:57.269
- [Beth] I just don't
know how to reach you.

121
00:07:57.338 --> 00:07:58.788
- You don't need to reach me!

122
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:01.101
There's nothing wrong.

123
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.518
- Mom. can we walk to
school today. please?

124
00:08:04.587 --> 00:08:05.795
- Let's go.

125
00:08:05.864 --> 00:08:07.176
- Grow up!

126
00:08:07.245 --> 00:08:08.280
- You grow up.

127
00:08:10.075 --> 00:08:12.215
- No. you grow up.

128
00:08:12.284 --> 00:08:13.769
- No. you grow up.

129
00:08:13.838 --> 00:08:14.770
- [Conner] You grow up.

130
00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:16.668
- [Beth] You grow up.

131
00:08:17.566 --> 00:08:20.741
[telephone ringing]

132
00:08:25.677 --> 00:08:26.885
- Why's my door closed?

133
00:08:26.954 --> 00:08:29.094
- [Bella] Your wife is in there.

134
00:08:29.163 --> 00:08:32.373
- Ex-wife. and I will need you
to interrupt in five minutes.

135
00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:33.961
Schedule a meeting.

136
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.686
- With who?

137
00:08:34.755 --> 00:08:36.239
- I don't care.

138
00:08:36.308 --> 00:08:37.137
- Okay.

139
00:08:39.415 --> 00:08:41.175
- You know she's
trying to bleed me

140
00:08:41.244 --> 00:08:42.970
for everything I have. right?

141
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.662
If there is a woman
in this nation

142
00:08:44.731 --> 00:08:47.319
that's not a certified nut
job. I'd like to meet her.

143
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.701
No offense.

144
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:50.737
- None taken.

145
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:53.774
[Michael clears throat]

146
00:08:53.843 --> 00:08:57.191
[tense pensive music]

147
00:09:34.194 --> 00:09:37.197
[telephone ringing]

148
00:09:38.336 --> 00:09:41.581
- Michael. what a
pleasure to see you.

149
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.860
- Oh. no. it's my privilege.

150
00:09:44.929 --> 00:09:46.931
I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

151
00:09:48.415 --> 00:09:51.521
- I know you think that
you can just ride this out.

152
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.799
and I'm gonna let it go.

153
00:09:53.869 --> 00:09:55.387
- I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

154
00:09:55.456 --> 00:09:59.668
- Oh. you think I don't know
about your Cayman accounts.

155
00:09:59.737 --> 00:10:02.187
[Mrs. Durwood laughs]

156
00:10:02.256 --> 00:10:04.845
- Still don't know what
you're talkin' about.

157
00:10:06.985 --> 00:10:09.988
- But I want you to
know. without a doubt.

158
00:10:10.057 --> 00:10:12.888
that I will make you pay.

159
00:10:13.578 --> 00:10:16.685
even if I have to detach

160
00:10:16.754 --> 00:10:21.103
and sell the flesh
from your very bones.

161
00:10:22.518 --> 00:10:23.415
Is that understood?

162
00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:28.420
- I have no doubt.

163
00:10:29.836 --> 00:10:30.837
- Well then.

164
00:10:32.528 --> 00:10:33.425
good day to you.

165
00:10:41.261 --> 00:10:44.229
[telephone ringing]

166
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.445
- Good or bad?

167
00:10:53.514 --> 00:10:54.964
- In a decent mood.

168
00:10:55.033 --> 00:10:56.448
- I don't think you're
gonna make it tonight.

169
00:10:56.517 --> 00:10:58.002
- What's the matter with
you. that's not good news.

170
00:10:58.071 --> 00:10:59.451
- I'm just trying
to be realistic.

171
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.315
- Woe to you of little faith.

172
00:11:06.527 --> 00:11:09.082
- Benjamin. Benjamin. Benjamin.

173
00:11:19.817 --> 00:11:21.404
I should fire you.

174
00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:22.474
- You should promote me.

175
00:11:24.994 --> 00:11:26.824
- Okay. what you're
suggesting here

176
00:11:26.893 --> 00:11:28.342
flies in the face of the records

177
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:30.586
of maybe the biggest
client we have

178
00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:32.312
in North America. genius.

179
00:11:32.381 --> 00:11:33.727
- Second biggest.

180
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.733
- Let me get this straight.
so you're supposing

181
00:11:41.114 --> 00:11:43.254
that they owe us money.

182
00:11:44.289 --> 00:11:45.601
- Is that what you
read into that?

183
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.430
- Hey. don't play smart with me.

184
00:11:49.053 --> 00:11:51.434
- If in fact Lancer received
funds from the feds.

185
00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:54.575
and even if they overpaid us
into seven or eight figures.

186
00:11:54.644 --> 00:11:56.198
it appears we have a firewall.

187
00:11:56.267 --> 00:11:58.372
A list of services we
provided on a consulting level

188
00:11:58.441 --> 00:12:02.100
over a period of 20 years
that went uncompensated for--

189
00:12:02.169 --> 00:12:04.482
- Okay. okay. okay.
I see what you're do.

190
00:12:04.551 --> 00:12:06.035
[laughs] you know what?

191
00:12:06.104 --> 00:12:10.108
That's almost clever for
somebody as challenged as you.

192
00:12:11.144 --> 00:12:13.077
- If Lancer were
to point the finger

193
00:12:13.146 --> 00:12:15.424
at any accounting irregularity.

194
00:12:15.493 --> 00:12:18.392
let's say for some
bizarre speculation

195
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:23.328
that they were to say that
you embezzled funds from them.

196
00:12:25.503 --> 00:12:27.436
this would offer
some protection.

197
00:12:27.505 --> 00:12:29.300
or at least slow them
down for a little bit.

198
00:12:29.369 --> 00:12:30.680
I mean. not that
we would need it.

199
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.234
You do have regulated accounting

200
00:12:32.303 --> 00:12:34.339
as for where those
funds went. right?

201
00:12:35.962 --> 00:12:36.963
- Right.

202
00:12:38.274 --> 00:12:42.692
Listen. what this document's
laid out. it's too generic.

203
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.142
This is not gonna
stand up in court.

204
00:12:44.211 --> 00:12:48.422
and how did you get a
hold of this information?

205
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:49.872
- I just wanted you to know

206
00:12:49.941 --> 00:12:52.633
that we have the moral
high ground here.

207
00:12:52.702 --> 00:12:55.705
puts us in a stronger position.

208
00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.604
- It's ambitious.
but if you think

209
00:12:57.673 --> 00:13:00.227
this is gonna get you
upstairs. it won't.

210
00:13:00.296 --> 00:13:03.472
because if I even
allow this to be seen

211
00:13:03.541 --> 00:13:07.959
at a partner's desk. not gonna
have your name on it. son.

212
00:13:09.167 --> 00:13:11.549
- That's why I wake up
every morning. to serve you.

213
00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:15.553
- Huh. well. then. I'm
gonna do you a favor.

214
00:13:15.622 --> 00:13:18.798
and not 'cause you've earned
it. 'cause you haven't yet.

215
00:13:20.109 --> 00:13:24.148
If you can put this into a
format that passes muster

216
00:13:24.217 --> 00:13:28.600
with the boys. then
I might consider

217
00:13:29.878 --> 00:13:32.501
not firing you for accessing

218
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.953
confidential
company information.

219
00:13:36.022 --> 00:13:38.610
void of prior consent.

220
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.268
You got till midnight [mumbles].

221
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.445
- You know. I have a
very important dinner

222
00:13:45.514 --> 00:13:47.067
with my wife tonight.

223
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.276
- Do ya?

224
00:13:49.345 --> 00:13:51.347
Hmm. how exactly you
gonna plan on payin'

225
00:13:51.416 --> 00:13:53.418
for them dinner plans
without this cushy little job

226
00:13:53.487 --> 00:13:55.110
that I happened to
provide for you?

227
00:13:55.179 --> 00:13:58.734
And fear not. I will
give your wife my best.

228
00:13:58.803 --> 00:14:02.358
[melancholic pensive music]

229
00:14:04.222 --> 00:14:05.154
- [Coach] All right. guys.
let's start off talkin'

230
00:14:05.223 --> 00:14:06.707
about our full [mumbles].

231
00:14:06.776 --> 00:14:08.157
Start with the [mumbles]--

232
00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:09.158
- [Tim] Are you still
spendin' the night

233
00:14:09.227 --> 00:14:10.677
after the game Friday?

234
00:14:10.746 --> 00:14:11.920
- No!

235
00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:13.438
- Are your parents
dropping you off.

236
00:14:13.507 --> 00:14:16.269
or do you want a ride
home with my dad?

237
00:14:16.338 --> 00:14:18.858
- Look. I don't even like you.

238
00:14:19.789 --> 00:14:20.652
Nobody likes you.

239
00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:24.725
- Hey. I'm your only friend.

240
00:14:24.794 --> 00:14:26.382
You should try acting like it.

241
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.799
- Fine. I'll come over!

242
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:30.835
- [Tim] Cool.

243
00:14:30.904 --> 00:14:32.492
- But on one condition.

244
00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:34.080
- What?

245
00:14:34.149 --> 00:14:35.702
- We camp out in the backyard.

246
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:38.947
After your parents go
to sleep. we sneak out.

247
00:14:39.016 --> 00:14:40.638
- No. I'm not sneaking out!

248
00:14:40.707 --> 00:14:43.537
- [shushes] It's only camping.

249
00:14:43.606 --> 00:14:46.644
And it's up to you.
deal or no deal?

250
00:14:46.713 --> 00:14:47.748
- My mom won't let us.

251
00:14:47.817 --> 00:14:49.405
- Deal or no deal?

252
00:14:49.474 --> 00:14:51.580
- [Coach] And put your shoulder
into it a little bit. okay?

253
00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:53.271
It's all right. I want
to see you knock all--

254
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.169
- Deal.

255
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.310
- Tim. Conner!

256
00:14:57.379 --> 00:14:58.932
Since what I have to say
doesn't seem very important.

257
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:00.002
how 'bout the two of
you give me 10 more

258
00:15:00.071 --> 00:15:01.693
suicide sprints with William?

259
00:15:01.762 --> 00:15:03.178
- Thanks a lot. Tim.

260
00:15:03.247 --> 00:15:05.490
- [Coach] Now. come
on. fellas. let's go!

261
00:15:05.559 --> 00:15:06.940
You don't need the
ball. come on. guys.

262
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:08.804
This isn't gonna
cut it in college.

263
00:15:08.873 --> 00:15:12.118
[soft pensive music]

264
00:15:14.258 --> 00:15:16.018
- My daughter has
choir practice today.

265
00:15:16.087 --> 00:15:17.951
so I thought I'd take
off a little early.

266
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.573
- Go ahead.

267
00:15:19.642 --> 00:15:20.781
- [Carol] Sorry.

268
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.404
- It's okay.
- But thanks.

269
00:15:23.232 --> 00:15:24.647
- Oh. well. that's nice.

270
00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:27.236
So this is the example
Benjamin sets for ya. huh?

271
00:15:27.305 --> 00:15:28.755
Lettin' you get off early?

272
00:15:28.824 --> 00:15:30.308
- Yes. but.

273
00:15:31.275 --> 00:15:33.346
no. sir. I mean.
my daughter has a--

274
00:15:33.415 --> 00:15:35.520
- Whatever. I don't
wanna hear it.

275
00:15:35.589 --> 00:15:37.764
You. I want the
numbers on my desk.

276
00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:39.179
and I want 'em by midnight.

277
00:15:39.248 --> 00:15:40.249
- They'll be there.

278
00:15:40.318 --> 00:15:43.183
- Yeah. they'll be there.

279
00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:49.741
[bicycle chain clicking]
[soft pensive music]

280
00:15:52.882 --> 00:15:55.230
- Hey. Sharon. that a new bike?

281
00:15:55.299 --> 00:15:57.163
- Yeah. but the chains broke.

282
00:15:57.232 --> 00:15:58.716
- [Conner] That's not bad.

283
00:15:58.785 --> 00:16:00.166
- Where have you been?

284
00:16:00.235 --> 00:16:02.720
You haven't been in school
for. like. two months.

285
00:16:02.789 --> 00:16:05.033
Hey. what happened to your hair?

286
00:16:05.102 --> 00:16:06.068
- Lori!

287
00:16:06.137 --> 00:16:07.621
- I have cancer. or did.

288
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.140
They say they got most of it.

289
00:16:09.209 --> 00:16:10.624
I don't really know.

290
00:16:10.693 --> 00:16:12.626
They said my hair will
grow back some day.

291
00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:14.283
But I'm moving
soon to go camping.

292
00:16:14.352 --> 00:16:16.872
My dad doesn't have
to go to work anymore.

293
00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:18.460
so he said we can live in the RV

294
00:16:18.529 --> 00:16:20.669
and go camping whenever we want.

295
00:16:20.738 --> 00:16:21.739
Pretty cool. huh?

296
00:16:21.808 --> 00:16:23.258
- I wish we could do that!

297
00:16:23.327 --> 00:16:26.295
- That means they're
gonna be homeless.

298
00:16:26.364 --> 00:16:27.434
- Well. I've gotta go.

299
00:16:27.503 --> 00:16:29.298
See you at school or whatever.

300
00:16:29.367 --> 00:16:32.784
[bicycle chain clicking]

301
00:16:40.723 --> 00:16:43.726
- You were supposed to
be back two hours ago.

302
00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.521
- Yeah. well. the
unemployment office

303
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.799
doesn't exactly have the best
customer service. you know?

304
00:16:49.594 --> 00:16:50.802
So where's Sharon?

305
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:51.872
- She's out riding her bike.

306
00:16:51.941 --> 00:16:53.426
- All right. I'll go get her.

307
00:16:53.495 --> 00:16:56.118
- No. no. she'll be back in
a few minutes. I know it.

308
00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:58.396
- But it's getting late.

309
00:16:59.466 --> 00:17:00.950
- If she's not
back in 15 minutes.

310
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.228
then you can go look for her.

311
00:17:02.297 --> 00:17:03.574
She needs some time!

312
00:17:03.643 --> 00:17:05.507
- All right. fine.
she needs time.

313
00:17:07.888 --> 00:17:09.304
You know what?

314
00:17:09.373 --> 00:17:11.927
I'm not the only person
who could work. you know?

315
00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:13.342
I mean. maybe you could start

316
00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:15.517
an online business.
or something.

317
00:17:15.586 --> 00:17:17.829
You don't even touch
the computer I gave you.

318
00:17:19.555 --> 00:17:20.384
Just an idea.

319
00:17:26.769 --> 00:17:29.703
[soft tense music]

320
00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:37.504
[bicycle rattling]

321
00:17:40.128 --> 00:17:43.717
[bicycle chain clicking]

322
00:17:47.238 --> 00:17:49.861
[wind blowing]

323
00:17:53.969 --> 00:17:55.729
- When is Grandma comin' over?

324
00:17:55.798 --> 00:17:56.730
- She's on her way.

325
00:17:58.939 --> 00:18:00.631
- Where does cancer come from?

326
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.529
- [Conner] Comes from
eating too much pizza.

327
00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:04.186
and it looks like
you're well on your way.

328
00:18:04.255 --> 00:18:06.464
- There's never too much pizza!

329
00:18:06.533 --> 00:18:09.018
- [groans] What was that for?

330
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:09.847
- Please. Conner.

331
00:18:10.848 --> 00:18:12.850
Lori. where did you
hear about cancer?

332
00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:14.334
- The girl down the
street named Sharon

333
00:18:14.403 --> 00:18:16.060
lost all her hair from cancer.

334
00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:17.993
Now she gets to skip school.

335
00:18:18.062 --> 00:18:19.339
Could I get cancer?

336
00:18:21.928 --> 00:18:23.447
- Probably not.

337
00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:27.313
I don't know where
cancer comes from. honey.

338
00:18:27.382 --> 00:18:29.798
There are plenty of
smart doctors who do.

339
00:18:29.867 --> 00:18:30.833
- And Mommy?

340
00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:32.283
- Yes. honey?

341
00:18:32.352 --> 00:18:34.423
- Did you talk to
Daddy about the trip?

342
00:18:34.492 --> 00:18:36.874
- He's not going to
take you camping.

343
00:18:36.943 --> 00:18:39.463
He can't even make
it home for dinner.

344
00:18:39.532 --> 00:18:41.361
You think he's just
gonna pop a tent for us

345
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.707
in the mountains. huh?

346
00:18:42.776 --> 00:18:45.641
- Yes. I have
faith that he will.

347
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.022
- Grace first.

348
00:18:47.091 --> 00:18:48.679
- I'll say grace.

349
00:18:49.887 --> 00:18:51.751
Grace.

350
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.821
- I'll pray.

351
00:18:56.376 --> 00:18:58.792
God. thank you for this meal.

352
00:18:58.861 --> 00:19:00.898
and for our Conner.
so he'll be nice

353
00:19:00.967 --> 00:19:02.555
and stop making fun of me.

354
00:19:02.624 --> 00:19:03.901
Amen.

355
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.351
- Beautiful. sweetheart.

356
00:19:13.013 --> 00:19:14.946
- Bella. where's Benjamin?

357
00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:17.880
I mean. you know
Lancer's about to unleash

358
00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.606
the feds on me. right?

359
00:19:19.675 --> 00:19:21.021
And I gotta go over
those numbers with him.

360
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.644
I mean. where did he go?

361
00:19:22.713 --> 00:19:25.060
I mean. this is startin' to
feel like Enron reincarnated.

362
00:19:25.129 --> 00:19:26.303
- Sir. he went home.

363
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:29.478
- I see.

364
00:19:29.547 --> 00:19:30.962
- He had a dinner reservation.

365
00:19:33.448 --> 00:19:35.967
- Hmm. well. that's sweet. huh?

366
00:19:36.036 --> 00:19:37.624
- Would you like me to call him?

367
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.559
- No. I'd like you to do
what I asked you to do.

368
00:19:41.628 --> 00:19:42.871
which is to find my phone.

369
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:43.975
Can you do that for me?

370
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:46.668
- Sir. I called the restaurant.

371
00:19:46.737 --> 00:19:49.084
and they said that they
hadn't found anything.

372
00:19:49.153 --> 00:19:50.706
Who were you there with?

373
00:19:50.775 --> 00:19:53.433
[Michael sighs]

374
00:19:55.849 --> 00:19:57.782
- You get Benjamin here.
and I mean right now.

375
00:19:57.851 --> 00:20:00.785
[soft tense music]

376
00:20:13.867 --> 00:20:14.868
- You're kidding me.

377
00:20:16.974 --> 00:20:19.632
I could try and slip away
after my dinner with my wife.

378
00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:22.497
but he's not even gonna look
at it until tomorrow morning.

379
00:20:22.566 --> 00:20:23.739
- No. he said he needs them

380
00:20:23.808 --> 00:20:25.603
on the partner's
desk first thing.

381
00:20:25.672 --> 00:20:28.675
- Bella. this dinner with
my wife is important.

382
00:20:28.744 --> 00:20:31.713
I'm taking her to
The Melting Pot.

383
00:20:32.748 --> 00:20:34.198
- [Bella] Look.
okay. the restaurant

384
00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:35.648
is right down the block.

385
00:20:35.717 --> 00:20:37.028
I'm gonna have a limo
come pick her up.

386
00:20:37.097 --> 00:20:37.857
- Fine.

387
00:20:38.961 --> 00:20:41.032
- Hey. how come you're
not in the shower yet?

388
00:20:44.104 --> 00:20:45.830
No. no way.

389
00:20:46.624 --> 00:20:48.039
- The firm's bein' audited.

390
00:20:49.351 --> 00:20:50.663
It's the biggest
case we've ever run.

391
00:20:50.732 --> 00:20:52.941
I've never seen
anything like this.

392
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.255
Durwood would have my job
if I didn't help him out.

393
00:20:56.324 --> 00:20:58.326
- Excuses. it's all I ever hear.

394
00:20:59.223 --> 00:21:00.293
- No. it's not.

395
00:21:01.398 --> 00:21:03.641
It's the only way I'll
ever make partner.

396
00:21:04.711 --> 00:21:06.851
- Make partner. right.

397
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.681
You lied to me.

398
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.545
- I got a limo for you.

399
00:21:10.614 --> 00:21:11.615
I'll meet you at the restaurant.

400
00:21:11.684 --> 00:21:13.375
It'll be just like we planned.

401
00:21:14.376 --> 00:21:15.929
- I knew it. I knew
this would happen.

402
00:21:15.998 --> 00:21:18.277
I don't know why I thought
tonight would be any different.

403
00:21:18.346 --> 00:21:21.038
- We will. trust
me. I'll be there.

404
00:21:21.107 --> 00:21:22.557
The sooner I get going.

405
00:21:22.626 --> 00:21:24.110
the sooner I can meet
you at the restaurant.

406
00:21:24.179 --> 00:21:26.077
- I am sick of it. sick of it!

407
00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.079
Don't touch me!

408
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.083
- This night is as important
to me as it is to you.

409
00:21:35.224 --> 00:21:36.709
I wanted to surprise you.

410
00:21:38.849 --> 00:21:41.334
I got us a room
at the Vanderbilt.

411
00:21:41.403 --> 00:21:44.958
[soft melancholic music]

412
00:21:46.235 --> 00:21:48.099
- How can you live
with yourself?

413
00:21:51.931 --> 00:21:53.519
- How do you do it?

414
00:21:53.588 --> 00:21:54.761
- You're trouble.

415
00:21:57.281 --> 00:21:58.938
- So we're good?

416
00:21:59.007 --> 00:22:00.664
- No. we're not good.

417
00:22:01.975 --> 00:22:03.080
- We're good.

418
00:22:06.152 --> 00:22:08.292
[Beth sighs]

419
00:22:08.361 --> 00:22:10.225
I'll be there. I promise.

420
00:22:10.294 --> 00:22:13.711
[soft melancholic music]

421
00:22:19.234 --> 00:22:22.133
[soft tense music]

422
00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:34.525
- You look gorgeous.

423
00:22:37.148 --> 00:22:38.149
Honey. what's wrong?

424
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.774
- You try being
married to a lawyer.

425
00:22:41.843 --> 00:22:44.432
He's sending a limo so he can
meet me at the restaurant.

426
00:22:44.501 --> 00:22:46.192
or so he says.

427
00:22:46.261 --> 00:22:47.158
Romantic. isn't it?

428
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.404
- Well. depends on
how you look at it.

429
00:22:51.473 --> 00:22:52.509
It could be.

430
00:22:53.613 --> 00:22:55.822
Look at it like he's
sending his chariot

431
00:22:55.891 --> 00:22:58.307
to pick you up to
meet him at the ball.

432
00:22:58.377 --> 00:22:59.792
That has potential.

433
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.521
- It sounds nice. but that's
somebody else's story.

434
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.213
[tense pensive music]

435
00:23:07.282 --> 00:23:10.561
- Tonight. this is your story.

436
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.978
[tense pensive music]

437
00:23:15.704 --> 00:23:17.085
[cell phone chiming
and vibrating]

438
00:23:17.154 --> 00:23:19.639
[car revving]

439
00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:27.647
[cell phone chiming
and vibrating]

440
00:23:33.826 --> 00:23:35.483
- Durwood. what are you up to?

441
00:23:35.552 --> 00:23:40.729
[car revving]
[tense music]

442
00:23:56.296 --> 00:23:57.643
Yes!
[Sharon screams]

443
00:23:57.712 --> 00:24:02.233
[loud thudding]
[car tires screeching]

444
00:24:12.692 --> 00:24:15.868
[melancholic music]

445
00:24:35.404 --> 00:24:37.303
Somebody. help me!

446
00:24:37.372 --> 00:24:40.548
[melancholic music]

447
00:24:56.322 --> 00:25:01.189
- [Radio Dispatcher] [mumbling]
300 Winter Boulevard.

448
00:25:01.258 --> 00:25:04.261
[melancholic music]

449
00:25:06.332 --> 00:25:09.404
[siren wailing]

450
00:25:09.473 --> 00:25:11.233
- I heard a loud thump.

451
00:25:11.302 --> 00:25:14.996
and those brakes
screeching like pigeons.

452
00:25:15.065 --> 00:25:17.205
Then I looked up and I
saw that man over there

453
00:25:17.274 --> 00:25:20.346
with a cell phone in his hand.

454
00:25:20.415 --> 00:25:23.280
like all the kids do these days!

455
00:25:25.282 --> 00:25:26.386
- [Policeman] He was
texting and driving.

456
00:25:26.455 --> 00:25:27.733
would you say that?

457
00:25:27.802 --> 00:25:29.631
- [Witness] Oh. I don't know.

458
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.220
- Stay here.
- I suppose so.

459
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.225
- Sorry. we're gonna take
this into evidence. sir.

460
00:25:38.295 --> 00:25:39.089
- How's the little girl?

461
00:25:39.158 --> 00:25:39.952
She gonna be okay?

462
00:25:40.021 --> 00:25:41.574
I need to call my wife.

463
00:25:41.643 --> 00:25:42.782
- You can do all that
from the station.

464
00:25:42.851 --> 00:25:44.370
Were you talking
or texting on this

465
00:25:44.439 --> 00:25:46.441
when the accident occurred?

466
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:47.546
- What are you saying?

467
00:25:47.615 --> 00:25:48.616
- This phone. so you were on it

468
00:25:48.685 --> 00:25:50.134
when you hit the little girl?

469
00:25:50.203 --> 00:25:51.480
- What?

470
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.378
- You been drinking?

471
00:25:52.447 --> 00:25:53.793
- No. I haven't.

472
00:25:53.862 --> 00:25:54.863
- You have the right
to remain silent.

473
00:25:54.932 --> 00:25:56.451
- What are you accusing me of?

474
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.487
- Anything you say or do can
and will be used against you

475
00:25:58.557 --> 00:25:59.730
in the court of law.

476
00:25:59.799 --> 00:26:01.076
You have the right
to an attorney.

477
00:26:01.145 --> 00:26:01.974
Stand still.

478
00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:03.907
[cell phone camera clicks]

479
00:26:03.976 --> 00:26:05.529
- Look. no. I need
to call my wife!

480
00:26:05.598 --> 00:26:06.357
- You're goin' in.

481
00:26:06.426 --> 00:26:07.462
- What?

482
00:26:07.531 --> 00:26:09.084
She's just down the street.

483
00:26:10.085 --> 00:26:13.572
[muffled chattering
over police radio]

484
00:26:13.641 --> 00:26:16.989
[tense pensive music]

485
00:26:26.515 --> 00:26:28.932
[telephone ringing]

486
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:31.486
- Larry's Law. Darla speaking.

487
00:26:31.555 --> 00:26:33.868
- Some lawyer hit a little girl.

488
00:26:33.937 --> 00:26:35.386
I just sent you a picture.

489
00:26:36.456 --> 00:26:39.218
This guy's a real scumbag
lawyer. probably filthy rich.

490
00:26:39.287 --> 00:26:42.808
no remorse. like he was texting
at the time of the accident.

491
00:26:42.877 --> 00:26:44.154
You owe me.

492
00:26:44.223 --> 00:26:46.881
[siren wailing]

493
00:26:56.442 --> 00:26:58.824
[Larry huffing]

494
00:26:58.893 --> 00:27:01.240
- [Darla] Hey. Larry.

495
00:27:01.309 --> 00:27:03.449
- I know this guy. we went
to high school together!

496
00:27:03.518 --> 00:27:05.831
Real hotshot. fancy law school.

497
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.177
Thought he was really somethin'

498
00:27:07.246 --> 00:27:08.903
just 'cause I didn't
go to Harvard.

499
00:27:08.972 --> 00:27:11.146
- There ain't nothin'
wrong with a GED. baby.

500
00:27:11.215 --> 00:27:12.700
- Not so hot anymore.

501
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:14.529
Not after Larry's

- Yeah. you got the spike gun!

503
00:27:17.774 --> 00:27:18.844

Oh. yeah!

Yeah. what's he gonna

508
00:27:27.507 --> 00:27:30.545
[siren wailing]

509
00:27:30.614 --> 00:27:33.375
- [Conner] Oh. my gosh!

00:28:11.517 --> 00:28:12.691
- [Carol] What's going on?

533
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.899
I keep texting and
calling Benjamin.

534
00:28:13.968 --> 00:28:15.935
- He's been in an
accident. Carol.

535
00:28:16.867 --> 00:28:19.145
He's run over a little girl.

536
00:28:19.214 --> 00:28:21.078
They've taken her
to the hospital.

537
00:28:21.976 --> 00:28:24.047
The police took
Benjamin. maybe to jail.

538
00:28:24.772 --> 00:28:25.773
I don't know.

539
00:28:26.774 --> 00:28:28.223
- [Carol] Beth. listen to me.

540
00:28:28.292 --> 00:28:30.639
I know you're in shock.
I need you to focus.

541
00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:32.400
We'll get through this.

542
00:28:32.469 --> 00:28:33.919
Just stay calm.

543
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:38.820
[soft tense music]

544
00:28:43.342 --> 00:28:44.895
- I think we're lookin'
at some real money. baby.

545
00:28:44.964 --> 00:28:48.036
We have got to pounce.
you know what I'm sayin'?

546
00:28:48.105 --> 00:28:49.555
No more sittin' around.

547
00:28:49.624 --> 00:28:50.798
We've been takin' these
low-level jobs long enough.

548
00:28:50.867 --> 00:28:52.351
Not anymore. no. sir.

549
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.733
Time to go for the big
leagues. you know what I mean?

550
00:28:54.802 --> 00:28:56.148
I mean. no more
ambulance chasin'.

551
00:28:56.217 --> 00:28:57.494
We gotta strike
while the iron's hot.

552
00:28:57.563 --> 00:28:58.944
You know what's hot right now?

553
00:28:59.013 --> 00:29:00.531
Textin' and drivin'.
drivin' and textin'.

554
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.086
Justice will take our
side any day of the week.

555
00:29:03.155 --> 00:29:04.881
This is actually the
future of injury cases.

556
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:05.882
I guarantee it.

557
00:29:05.951 --> 00:29:07.746
DUI's a thing of the past.

558
00:29:09.609 --> 00:29:10.990
Are you listenin'?

559
00:29:11.059 --> 00:29:12.026
Didn't look to me like
you was listenin'.

560
00:29:12.095 --> 00:29:13.510
What's the golden goose?

561
00:29:13.579 --> 00:29:14.925
- Textin' and drivin'.
drivin' and textin'. Larry.

562
00:29:14.994 --> 00:29:16.444
I heard ya.

563
00:29:16.513 --> 00:29:17.825
- All right. that's
what I'm talkin' about.

564
00:29:17.894 --> 00:29:19.205
- [Darla] Well. if
that's the case.

565
00:29:19.274 --> 00:29:20.448
then why am I still
on minimum wage?

566
00:29:20.517 --> 00:29:21.898
- Honey. you lack conviction.

567
00:29:21.967 --> 00:29:23.589
- [scoffs] That
doesn't make any sense.

568
00:29:23.658 --> 00:29:24.693
- Let's talk about that later.

569
00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:25.971
Did you get a hold of hospital?

570
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.351
- Of course I did.

571
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.663
- All right! [claps]

572
00:29:28.732 --> 00:29:30.147
I'm tellin' you.
this is the one.

573
00:29:30.216 --> 00:29:31.631
this is the one we've been
waitin' for. honey pie.

574
00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.598
This is gonna take us places.

575
00:29:32.667 --> 00:29:33.599
Forget the Bahamas.

576
00:29:33.668 --> 00:29:34.842
I'm gonna shuck and jive.

577
00:29:34.911 --> 00:29:36.429
They are not gonna
see Larry comin'.

578
00:29:36.498 --> 00:29:38.121
Bang. zoom. I'm outta here!

579
00:29:42.988 --> 00:29:45.576
- All right. all right.
good. just send it to me.

580
00:29:47.751 --> 00:29:49.580
- [Mr. Hash] What's goin' on?

581
00:29:50.754 --> 00:29:52.031
- Nothing.

582
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.482
- Is it about one of our guys?

583
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:55.932
Not in the middle of an audit.

584
00:29:56.001 --> 00:29:57.623
We're already on thin
ice with the feds.

585
00:29:57.692 --> 00:29:59.038
- Just stay out of it.

586
00:29:59.107 --> 00:30:00.522
- We can't handle
publicity right now.

587
00:30:00.591 --> 00:30:02.283
- As far as we know.
it was an accident.

588
00:30:02.352 --> 00:30:05.389
I'm telling you. this is
nothing for you to worry about.

589
00:30:05.458 --> 00:30:07.081
- Cut him loose. Jack!

590
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.530
Would you rather
take one to the head.

591
00:30:08.599 --> 00:30:11.533
or two to the chest
and bleed to death?

592
00:30:11.602 --> 00:30:13.156
Cut him loose.

593
00:30:13.225 --> 00:30:15.814
I'm tellin' you.
we don't need this.

594
00:30:15.883 --> 00:30:17.677
- Now. is that a threat?

595
00:30:17.746 --> 00:30:20.888
- [sighs] What's the boy's name?

596
00:30:22.717 --> 00:30:26.445
- Stills. Benjamin Stills.

597
00:30:28.792 --> 00:30:30.000
- Larry. guess what!

598
00:30:30.069 --> 00:30:31.657
Joe just called me.

599
00:30:31.726 --> 00:30:33.348
They just took that little girl
to the children's hospital.

600
00:30:33.417 --> 00:30:34.798
and get this.
- We won.

601
00:30:34.867 --> 00:30:36.627
Try and track a lead right now.

602
00:30:36.696 --> 00:30:38.560
- [Darla] He is a
big fancy lawyer

603
00:30:38.629 --> 00:30:40.148
who represents the same company

604
00:30:40.217 --> 00:30:42.185
that her dad was
just fired from.

605
00:30:42.254 --> 00:30:45.464
- Lancer. it's called Lancer
Multinational Corporation.

606
00:30:45.533 --> 00:30:46.948
Good one!

607
00:30:47.017 --> 00:30:48.329
Now. get me the number of
the children's hospital.

608
00:30:48.398 --> 00:30:49.986
and I'm gonna pounce
on this bad boy

609
00:30:50.055 --> 00:30:53.644
like Saturday Night
Fever. baby! [grunts]

610
00:30:53.713 --> 00:30:55.543
[soft melancholic music]

611
00:30:55.612 --> 00:30:57.648
- What are you still doing up?

612
00:30:59.029 --> 00:31:01.618
- They don't arrest a
driver unless it's serious.

613
00:31:01.687 --> 00:31:04.379
He may face criminal charges.

614
00:31:04.448 --> 00:31:08.590
- Beth. we will get through
this. I promise you.

615
00:31:08.659 --> 00:31:11.007
But for now. why
don't you go upstairs

616
00:31:11.076 --> 00:31:12.491
and try and get some sleep?

617
00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.458
Worrying about this isn't
going to help anybody.

618
00:31:14.527 --> 00:31:16.771
- Do you have any idea
what's going on outside?

619
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.430
[soft melancholic music]

620
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.295
You look out my front window.

621
00:31:23.364 --> 00:31:25.400
and you tell me there's no
good reason to be upset.

622
00:31:25.469 --> 00:31:27.057
- [Reporter] This picture
of Benjamin Stills

623
00:31:27.126 --> 00:31:28.887
was taken just moments
after the accident.

624
00:31:28.956 --> 00:31:31.510
[soft melancholic music]

625
00:31:31.579 --> 00:31:34.582
[metallic clanging]

626
00:31:35.583 --> 00:31:40.933
- Hey. sweetheart.
I like them shoes.

627
00:31:41.865 --> 00:31:42.866
Where'd you get them shoes?

628
00:31:42.935 --> 00:31:43.971
I think I wanna buy me a pair.

629
00:31:46.007 --> 00:31:47.112
- I don't remember.

630
00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:50.598
- Wanna hear a secret?

631
00:31:50.667 --> 00:31:51.461
- No.

632
00:31:55.085 --> 00:31:56.052
Sure.

633
00:31:58.675 --> 00:32:02.023
- These guys are gonna eat
you alive in here. man.

634
00:32:04.508 --> 00:32:05.337
Wedding ring?

635
00:32:06.994 --> 00:32:08.443
Expensive watch.

636
00:32:09.893 --> 00:32:10.721
Don't worry.

637
00:32:12.033 --> 00:32:13.517
I'll take care of ya.

638
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.452
- I appreciate that.

639
00:32:17.521 --> 00:32:18.626
- Benjamin Stills!

640
00:32:21.525 --> 00:32:22.354
Goin' home.

641
00:32:22.423 --> 00:32:26.737
[soft melancholic music]

642
00:32:26.806 --> 00:32:30.465
[siren wailing in distance]

643
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.071
- Hello. Benjamin.

644
00:32:51.176 --> 00:32:53.764
You might not know my
face. I work upstairs.

645
00:32:54.627 --> 00:32:56.595
- Mr. Cromer. I
know who you are.

646
00:32:56.664 --> 00:32:58.424
- Considering the situation.
I thought it might be helpful

647
00:32:58.493 --> 00:33:00.633
if you had a friendly
face here to meet you.

648
00:33:00.702 --> 00:33:01.496
Come on. get in.

649
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.781
How much do you know
about what happened?

650
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.301
- I remember everything.

651
00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:16.787
I was driving along. and then.

652
00:33:17.788 --> 00:33:20.446
the little girl just.
she came outta nowhere.

653
00:33:21.275 --> 00:33:22.276
- Poor child.

654
00:33:24.657 --> 00:33:26.073
- I have to go see her. I
have to go to the hospital.

655
00:33:26.142 --> 00:33:27.660
Drive--
- No. no. no. no.

656
00:33:27.729 --> 00:33:31.906
She's in a coma. but
her condition is stable.

657
00:33:31.975 --> 00:33:35.289
Making contact with the victim.
that's not going to happen.

658
00:33:36.393 --> 00:33:38.982
Right now. your
family needs you.

659
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:41.019
Benjamin. you need
to stay centered.

660
00:33:42.296 --> 00:33:43.573
You had a company phone on you

661
00:33:43.642 --> 00:33:46.093
at the time of the
accident. right?

662
00:33:46.162 --> 00:33:47.887
- Police took everything.

663
00:33:47.956 --> 00:33:49.855
- City or state. the officers?

664
00:33:49.924 --> 00:33:51.857
- State. I think.

665
00:33:51.926 --> 00:33:53.307
- Good. good.

666
00:33:53.376 --> 00:33:54.860
Now. when you get home.

667
00:33:54.929 --> 00:33:57.759
it's just fine not to
talk to those reporters.

668
00:33:57.828 --> 00:34:00.935
If you're questioned.
it's perfectly
acceptable to just say.

669
00:34:01.004 --> 00:34:02.523
"I don't recall."

670
00:34:04.352 --> 00:34:05.767
It's all over the press.

671
00:34:06.941 --> 00:34:09.219
That girl you hit
was a cancer patient.

672
00:34:10.082 --> 00:34:11.152
What are the odds?

673
00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:13.982
- I can't believe
this is happening.

674
00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:15.570
- Press just gobbles that up.

675
00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.779
I know you know this.
but it's very different

676
00:34:17.848 --> 00:34:20.299
when you're the one
on the spot. trust me.

677
00:34:23.716 --> 00:34:25.649
- Mr. Cromer. I don't
mean to be rude.

678
00:34:25.718 --> 00:34:28.894
but I've worked for your
firm for several years now.

679
00:34:28.963 --> 00:34:32.691
and you and I have never so
much as even sat down together.

680
00:34:33.726 --> 00:34:36.902
Now this accident. and you
show up at the police station.

681
00:34:36.971 --> 00:34:40.871
I appreciate the ride.
but what is this?

682
00:34:42.942 --> 00:34:44.565
- You're one of
us now. Benjamin.

683
00:34:45.945 --> 00:34:47.533
We always take care of our own.

684
00:34:49.052 --> 00:34:52.435
[soft melancholic music]

685
00:35:02.238 --> 00:35:03.239
Benjamin.

686
00:35:04.067 --> 00:35:05.241
are you thinking this situation

687
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.898
might be more than
you can handle?

688
00:35:10.038 --> 00:35:10.867
- Just slightly.

689
00:35:12.627 --> 00:35:13.456
- Just pray.

690
00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.906
You'll get through this.

691
00:35:16.838 --> 00:35:17.701
Let's go. Andrew.

692
00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:26.710
- Benjamin!

693
00:35:28.402 --> 00:35:29.403
Oh. my God!

694
00:35:30.197 --> 00:35:31.094
What happened to you?

695
00:35:31.163 --> 00:35:32.371
You didn't call me!

696
00:35:34.856 --> 00:35:37.065
- Okay. Sabrina. when you
go see Dr. Stevens tomorrow.

697
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:38.860
you tell him exactly
as I told you.

698
00:35:38.929 --> 00:35:41.069
That's right. you've had
numbness down your arm

699
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:41.932
since the accident.

700
00:35:42.968 --> 00:35:45.867
No. no. no. not before.
that's when it started.

701
00:35:45.936 --> 00:35:47.386
Okay.

702
00:35:47.455 --> 00:35:48.663
And you're gonna bring
a written report to me

703
00:35:48.732 --> 00:35:49.906
that he gives you.

704
00:35:49.975 --> 00:35:51.873
All right. baby doll. bye-bye.

705
00:35:54.428 --> 00:35:56.878
I am gonna kill this thing!

706
00:35:58.501 --> 00:36:01.676
[warm pensive music]

707
00:38:05.213 --> 00:38:08.424
- [gasps] Where are the kids?

708
00:38:08.493 --> 00:38:10.149
- They're here. they're fine.

709
00:38:10.218 --> 00:38:12.945
- [panting] Right.

710
00:38:13.014 --> 00:38:14.084
- Come back to sleep.

711
00:38:16.708 --> 00:38:17.950
- It really happened.

712
00:38:20.401 --> 00:38:21.885
- Yes. it really happened.

713
00:38:25.233 --> 00:38:26.580
- I have to go see her.

714
00:38:27.719 --> 00:38:29.962
- Honey. I don't think
that's a good idea.

715
00:38:30.963 --> 00:38:33.656
Look. I know you wanna
do the right thing.

716
00:38:33.725 --> 00:38:35.934
but it's all over the media.

717
00:38:36.003 --> 00:38:37.349
They have it out for you.

718
00:38:37.418 --> 00:38:39.006
There are reporters
at that hospital.

719
00:38:41.249 --> 00:38:43.355
- If that little girl dies.

720
00:38:43.424 --> 00:38:45.115
- It was an accident.

721
00:38:50.569 --> 00:38:52.088
- If the girl dies.

722
00:38:52.157 --> 00:38:54.849
they'll have me on
vehicular manslaughter.

723
00:38:57.024 --> 00:38:58.128
- She's not dead.

724
00:38:59.026 --> 00:39:00.061
It's gonna be fine.

725
00:39:01.684 --> 00:39:03.858
- Honey. this is what
I do for a living.

726
00:39:15.214 --> 00:39:16.664
- Benjamin!

727
00:39:16.733 --> 00:39:19.149
I did not expect to
see you here this late.

728
00:39:20.219 --> 00:39:21.497
That's dedicated.

729
00:39:21.566 --> 00:39:23.050
- Just finishing up.

730
00:39:25.259 --> 00:39:27.744
- You wouldn't happened
to have seen my phone?

731
00:39:27.813 --> 00:39:32.611
'Cause I'm almost positive
I left it at that restaurant

732
00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.164
that you and I were...

733
00:39:36.304 --> 00:39:37.133
Ah. forget it.

734
00:39:38.168 --> 00:39:41.171
So. what do you know
about that Lancer case?

735
00:39:42.483 --> 00:39:44.485
- Not that much. actually.

736
00:39:44.554 --> 00:39:47.626
- You know. I am curious.

737
00:39:47.695 --> 00:39:49.559
when you got in that accident.

738
00:39:50.457 --> 00:39:52.251
were you on your phone?

739
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.081
'Cause I was talkin' to the DA.

740
00:39:56.324 --> 00:39:57.912
he said it happened pretty fast.

741
00:39:59.327 --> 00:40:01.260
- What are you doing here.

742
00:40:01.329 --> 00:40:02.848
and with friends?

743
00:40:04.056 --> 00:40:05.920
- Oh! [chuckles]

744
00:40:05.989 --> 00:40:09.061
Well. the partners
have impressed upon me

745
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.547
the privilege of bringing
to your attention

746
00:40:11.616 --> 00:40:14.619
the importance of integrity.

747
00:40:14.688 --> 00:40:19.347
and confidentiality when
it comes to anything

748
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:22.212
in regards to this
company. because

749
00:40:23.731 --> 00:40:26.769
we are very serious
about protectin' our
interest. Benjamin.

750
00:40:29.496 --> 00:40:33.776
Anyways. I did
have the foresight

751
00:40:33.845 --> 00:40:38.505
to draft a little addendum to
the confidentiality agreement

752
00:40:38.574 --> 00:40:41.024
that we have with you.

753
00:40:49.757 --> 00:40:51.172
- Interesting.

754
00:40:51.241 --> 00:40:53.761
- Mm-hmm. matter of fact.
I think you'll find that

755
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:55.245
in your best interest.

756
00:40:58.317 --> 00:40:59.077
And

757
00:41:00.527 --> 00:41:01.493
you'll sign it.

758
00:41:02.321 --> 00:41:03.253
- And

759
00:41:05.635 --> 00:41:06.636
if I don't?

760
00:41:10.295 --> 00:41:13.022
- [laughs] What?

761
00:41:14.092 --> 00:41:17.198
Nah. you don't wanna
go there. do you?

762
00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:19.269
We're on the same
team now. aren't we?

763
00:41:21.686 --> 00:41:24.274
And you will sign it. I promise.

764
00:41:29.348 --> 00:41:30.246
Let's go. guys.

765
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.460
- [Tall Doctor] Well. right
now. we're in a waiting mode.

766
00:41:37.529 --> 00:41:39.531
No one knows what
induces a coma sometimes.

767
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.222
- Okay. so what do we do now?

768
00:41:41.291 --> 00:41:43.224
I mean. there's
gotta be something!

769
00:41:43.293 --> 00:41:45.157
- We just have to wait and see.

770
00:41:45.226 --> 00:41:47.608
- That's it. that's all
you've got to say to us?

771
00:41:48.367 --> 00:41:49.783
- I'm afraid so.

772
00:41:49.852 --> 00:41:50.887
We just have to see
how her body responds.

773
00:41:50.956 --> 00:41:53.269
if she comes out of the coma.

774
00:41:53.338 --> 00:41:54.270
We'll know more soon.

775
00:41:55.236 --> 00:41:56.928
It could get worse.
it could get better.

776
00:41:57.998 --> 00:41:59.931
I'm sorry. that's the
best that I can do.

777
00:42:02.036 --> 00:42:04.383
- So what does
that leave us with?

778
00:42:04.452 --> 00:42:05.281
- I'm sorry.

779
00:42:16.292 --> 00:42:18.328
- Hey. how's your
daughter holdin' up?

780
00:42:19.847 --> 00:42:20.779
- Are you a doctor?

781
00:42:20.848 --> 00:42:22.022
- My name's Larry Layson.

782
00:42:22.091 --> 00:42:23.920
I'm here visiting
one of my clients.

783
00:42:23.989 --> 00:42:26.164
Heard what happened to your
daughter. it's a shame!

784
00:42:26.233 --> 00:42:27.303
- Yeah. thanks.

785
00:42:27.372 --> 00:42:28.442
- Do you have representation?

786
00:42:28.511 --> 00:42:29.719
You're gonna need it.

787
00:42:30.893 --> 00:42:32.342
- Representation for what?

788
00:42:32.411 --> 00:42:34.275
- To protect your rights
and your daughter's.

789
00:42:34.344 --> 00:42:36.381
The guy who hit her. he's
liable for serious damages

790
00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:37.347
to your family.

791
00:42:38.417 --> 00:42:40.592
I can help. if you like.

792
00:42:40.661 --> 00:42:42.525
- I'm sorry. do you work here?

793
00:42:42.594 --> 00:42:43.595
- Not exactly.

794
00:42:44.941 --> 00:42:47.806
- Well. I appreciate it.
but I think we're okay.

795
00:42:47.875 --> 00:42:52.259
- Oh. I'm sure you are. but
isn't this place expensive?

796
00:42:52.328 --> 00:42:55.849
[laughs] Trust me. bills
that come aren't as friendly

797
00:42:55.918 --> 00:42:57.367
as the faces you see here.

798
00:42:58.541 --> 00:43:02.649
Now. I have a close relationship

799
00:43:02.718 --> 00:43:04.305
with this hospital.

800
00:43:04.374 --> 00:43:06.376
Could be a good help
to you later on.

801
00:43:07.136 --> 00:43:08.724
Look. I care about your family.

802
00:43:08.793 --> 00:43:11.002
I don't wanna see ya high
and dry after all this.

803
00:43:12.486 --> 00:43:15.144
- No. they haven't been
that friendly here.

804
00:43:15.213 --> 00:43:19.424
- No. they're not. here
you go. [clicks tongue]

805
00:43:19.493 --> 00:43:22.392
[soft tense music]

806
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:48.626
[telephone ringing]

807
00:44:20.692 --> 00:44:23.626
[Beth sighs deeply]

808
00:44:23.695 --> 00:44:25.421
- Leave us alone!

809
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.319
- [Reporter] Would you care
to comment about your case.

810
00:44:27.388 --> 00:44:29.459
The Public versus Mr. Stills?

811
00:44:29.528 --> 00:44:32.048
It's our understanding
that Benjamin Stills

812
00:44:32.117 --> 00:44:35.155
was texting while driving
when the accident occurred.

813
00:44:35.224 --> 00:44:36.190
And the victim was

814
00:44:36.259 --> 00:44:38.054
a cancer survivor--
- No.

815
00:44:38.123 --> 00:44:39.159
- [Reporter] Is that correct?

816
00:44:39.228 --> 00:44:40.436
- No comment.

817
00:44:40.505 --> 00:44:43.232
- [Reporter] Well. no.
the public deserves to...

818
00:44:45.959 --> 00:44:48.478
- A tragedy has rocked a small
community here in Nashville.

819
00:44:48.547 --> 00:44:51.102
I'm standing outside the
home of Benjamin Stills.

820
00:44:51.171 --> 00:44:53.414
the man accused of
hitting a small child.

821
00:44:53.483 --> 00:44:55.934
As of now. the girl's
in critical condition.

822
00:44:56.003 --> 00:44:57.349
A candlelight vigil will be held

823
00:44:57.418 --> 00:44:59.697
at St. John's the Cathedral.
later this evening

824
00:44:59.766 --> 00:45:01.284
in prayer for her healing.

825
00:45:01.353 --> 00:45:03.321
We'll update you
as we learn more.

826
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.495
We'll send it back to
you now in the studio.

827
00:45:07.532 --> 00:45:09.948
- [Sam] I need to talk to
you about the Stills case.

828
00:45:11.674 --> 00:45:12.502
- Walk with me.

829
00:45:15.436 --> 00:45:17.093
- Still haven't been able
to get to the cell phone

830
00:45:17.162 --> 00:45:18.577
to prove he transmitted a text

831
00:45:18.646 --> 00:45:20.579
within that 11-second
window the accident occurred

832
00:45:20.648 --> 00:45:21.891
to send this guy
where he belongs.

833
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.961
- Oh. he's goin'
away. all right.

834
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:24.963
The question is for how long.

835
00:45:25.032 --> 00:45:26.413
How's the girl doin'?

836
00:45:26.482 --> 00:45:27.794
- Critical condition.

837
00:45:27.863 --> 00:45:28.795
I think the parents
will play ball.

838
00:45:28.864 --> 00:45:29.899
- You don't know that yet.

839
00:45:29.968 --> 00:45:31.349
- I'll tell you what I do know.

840
00:45:31.418 --> 00:45:32.557
If we don't make an
example of this guy.

841
00:45:32.626 --> 00:45:34.041
the public will crucify us.

842
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.940
- Kid. I've been at this
20 years without worrying

843
00:45:36.009 --> 00:45:37.769
for two seconds what
the public thinks.

844
00:45:37.838 --> 00:45:39.667
- I'm tellin' you.
the hot button here

845
00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:42.325
is voluntary vehicular
manslaughter for
driving and texting.

846
00:45:42.394 --> 00:45:44.638
He knowingly got behind the
wheel of a two-ton vehicle

847
00:45:44.707 --> 00:45:45.777
and chose to use
that cell phone.

848
00:45:45.846 --> 00:45:47.399
knowin' the damage he could do.

849
00:45:47.468 --> 00:45:49.539
- Just give me the
cell phone reports.

850
00:45:49.608 --> 00:45:51.541
We're gonna nail this guy.

851
00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:53.336
- I'm sorry. please don't call.

852
00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:56.236
- Carol. any word from our boy?

853
00:45:56.305 --> 00:45:58.686
- No. but there have been
several calls from reporters

854
00:45:58.756 --> 00:45:59.895
asking about him.

855
00:45:59.964 --> 00:46:01.413
What am I supposed to say?

856
00:46:01.482 --> 00:46:03.933
- Ignore 'em. we'll
issue a statement soon.

857
00:46:04.002 --> 00:46:05.176
Let us handle that.

858
00:46:06.591 --> 00:46:08.041
What was he doing here so late?

859
00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:09.767
- Durwood asked him to come in

860
00:46:09.836 --> 00:46:11.838
and go over billing on Lancer.

861
00:46:11.907 --> 00:46:12.804
- Hmm.

862
00:46:12.873 --> 00:46:16.497
[soft pensive music]

863
00:46:16.566 --> 00:46:19.500
Let me have everything
you've got on that.

864
00:46:19.569 --> 00:46:20.467
- You got it.

865
00:46:20.536 --> 00:46:23.539
[soft pensive music]

866
00:46:46.596 --> 00:46:49.082
- Facing charges
of reckless driving

867
00:46:49.151 --> 00:46:50.566
along with a pending charge

868
00:46:50.635 --> 00:46:53.327
of voluntary vehicular
manslaughter.

869
00:46:53.396 --> 00:46:54.950
If convicted. you could
receive a sentence

870
00:46:55.019 --> 00:46:58.056
of five or up to 20
years imprisonment.

871
00:46:58.125 --> 00:47:00.127
Do you understand
what you're facing?

872
00:47:01.508 --> 00:47:02.405
- Yes. Your Honor.

873
00:47:03.096 --> 00:47:04.649
- Are there any priors?

874
00:47:04.718 --> 00:47:06.306
- [Lawyer] None. Your Honor.

875
00:47:06.375 --> 00:47:08.653
- I will be releasing you on
your personal recognizance.

876
00:47:08.722 --> 00:47:11.035
but as the record indicates.

877
00:47:11.104 --> 00:47:13.831
you've been accused of
texting while driving.

878
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.835
Therefore. you are not to be
behind the wheel of a vehicle

879
00:47:17.904 --> 00:47:19.457
for any reason. is that clear?

880
00:47:19.526 --> 00:47:22.425
- Your Honor. given the
considerable resources available

881
00:47:22.494 --> 00:47:25.566
to this defendant. we
consider him a flight risk.

882
00:47:25.635 --> 00:47:28.431
That coupled with the threat
that he poses to the public.

883
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.641
we're asking that he be
detained until trial.

884
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:33.540
- Then although
he has no priors.

885
00:47:33.609 --> 00:47:35.266
because of the
financial resources

886
00:47:35.335 --> 00:47:36.612
available to the defendant.

887
00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:38.131
I'm gonna reduce the flight risk

888
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.203
by requiring the defendant
to wear an ankle tracer.

889
00:47:41.272 --> 00:47:42.514
Bail set.

890
00:47:42.583 --> 00:47:44.309
- Your Honor. what if
this happens again?

891
00:47:44.378 --> 00:47:47.036
This is a man who's proven
that he will disregard the law.

892
00:47:47.105 --> 00:47:48.762
What if he gets
behind the wheel.

893
00:47:48.831 --> 00:47:51.834
sends another text while
he's in a belligerent state?

894
00:47:51.903 --> 00:47:53.353
Whose child will end up--

895
00:47:53.422 --> 00:47:55.734
- Well. you need to
save that for the jury.

896
00:47:55.803 --> 00:47:56.735
Bail set.

897
00:47:56.804 --> 00:47:59.669
[gavel clangs loudly]

898
00:48:08.575 --> 00:48:11.129
- I can't believe they're
making you wear that dog leash.

899
00:48:11.198 --> 00:48:12.406
as if you would leave town

900
00:48:12.475 --> 00:48:13.856
before this whole
thing is settled.

901
00:48:13.925 --> 00:48:15.099
It's humiliating.

902
00:48:17.411 --> 00:48:18.930
- I hate that I'm
puttin' us through this.

903
00:48:18.999 --> 00:48:23.831
- I wanna take the
kids and I wanna go.

904
00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:25.247
- I don't want you to leave.

905
00:48:25.316 --> 00:48:27.421
- Then I need you to
sit down with them

906
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:30.666
and explain to them
what could happen.

907
00:48:30.735 --> 00:48:32.771
[dramatic tense music]

908
00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.842
[telephone ringing]

909
00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:35.843
- Hello!

910
00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:36.672
- [Conner] Who is it?

911
00:48:37.673 --> 00:48:39.019
- It's gonna be all
right. I promise.

912
00:48:39.088 --> 00:48:40.538
- No. it's not.

913
00:48:40.607 --> 00:48:41.711
It's not.

914
00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.230
- What will be all right?

915
00:48:43.299 --> 00:48:45.060
- Nothing. honey. you
finish your breakfast.

916
00:48:45.129 --> 00:48:46.785
I'm gonna take you
to school today.

917
00:48:46.854 --> 00:48:48.235
- What about Mommy?

918
00:48:48.304 --> 00:48:50.306
- Mommy and Daddy
have some stuff to do.

919
00:48:50.375 --> 00:48:51.687
- Yeah!
[Katherine shushes]

920
00:48:51.756 --> 00:48:53.378
Dad got her--
- Conner!

921
00:48:53.447 --> 00:48:55.242
Let your mom and
dad handle this.

922
00:48:55.311 --> 00:48:57.348
- Dad got arrested
for hitting Sharon.

923
00:48:57.417 --> 00:48:59.074
- It's not true. you're lying!

924
00:48:59.143 --> 00:49:01.835
- I told you it right
after it happened.

925
00:49:01.904 --> 00:49:04.079
Why won't you just accept it?

926
00:49:05.252 --> 00:49:07.565
- [Lori] Daddy. Daddy.
Conner said you were in jail!

927
00:49:10.602 --> 00:49:13.571
- Daddy's going through
a difficult situation.

928
00:49:15.124 --> 00:49:17.713
I did have an accident.
and now I gotta see

929
00:49:17.782 --> 00:49:19.542
if I can make things right.

930
00:49:19.611 --> 00:49:21.786
- Dad ran over your
friend. Sharon!

931
00:49:21.855 --> 00:49:22.718
Tell her!

932
00:49:22.787 --> 00:49:23.891
- No!

933
00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:24.927
- That's enough.

934
00:49:24.996 --> 00:49:27.412
- No. he's right. I did.

935
00:49:27.481 --> 00:49:31.278
- I've told you. I've been
telling you this whole time.

936
00:49:32.797 --> 00:49:33.591
- Lori.

937
00:49:35.834 --> 00:49:37.284
She's in the hospital.

938
00:49:37.353 --> 00:49:39.390
Your mom and I. we're gonna
go see her this morning.

939
00:49:39.459 --> 00:49:42.634
- I can draw her a picture
and make her feel better

940
00:49:42.703 --> 00:49:46.155
so they won't take you
to jail forever. Daddy.

941
00:49:46.224 --> 00:49:47.881
- I think that's a great idea.

942
00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.608
I'm sure it will
really help her.

943
00:49:51.712 --> 00:49:53.059
- I'll go get my drawing set.

944
00:49:53.128 --> 00:49:56.096
Gonna need a lot of
colors this time.

945
00:49:56.165 --> 00:49:57.960
- Conner. go help your sister.

946
00:49:58.029 --> 00:50:01.032
- Come on. please.
- Conner. go.

947
00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:02.240
- He'll come around.

948
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:03.759
[telephone ringing]

949
00:50:03.828 --> 00:50:04.898
- Don't answer that.

950
00:50:04.967 --> 00:50:05.864
- [Katherine] And just why not?

951
00:50:05.933 --> 00:50:06.796
[telephone ringing]

952
00:50:06.865 --> 00:50:08.143
- Death threats.

953
00:50:08.212 --> 00:50:09.592
- Oh. that's no way to live.

954
00:50:09.661 --> 00:50:11.801
[telephone ringing]
just no way at all.

955
00:50:12.975 --> 00:50:14.597
May I help you?

956
00:50:14.666 --> 00:50:17.428
No. I'm afraid you
must be mistaken. I...

957
00:50:19.775 --> 00:50:21.259
You should watch your mouth!

958
00:50:21.328 --> 00:50:23.779
Your mother would
be ashamed of you!

959
00:50:23.848 --> 00:50:25.125
Good day!

960
00:50:31.856 --> 00:50:35.377
[knocking on door]

961
00:50:35.446 --> 00:50:38.242
- You're not gonna like
what you find here.

962
00:50:38.311 --> 00:50:41.038
We just got the report back
on your boy's cell phone.

963
00:50:41.107 --> 00:50:42.073
- Try me.

964
00:50:44.731 --> 00:50:47.837
- Voluntary vehicular
manslaughter.

965
00:50:47.906 --> 00:50:49.736
- You're not serious.

966
00:50:49.805 --> 00:50:51.841
- Death requires responsibility.

967
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:54.292
- What am I missing here?

968
00:50:55.845 --> 00:50:57.571
You know. if you keep
fishing like this.

969
00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.849
it's you who's not gonna
like what you find.

970
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:03.715
- You know. you're awfully
protective of this kid.

971
00:51:03.784 --> 00:51:05.269
I wonder why.

972
00:51:05.338 --> 00:51:06.856
- And you're outta your depth.

973
00:51:07.995 --> 00:51:08.858
- Yeah. maybe so.

974
00:51:10.619 --> 00:51:13.449
- You like that chair.
comfortable enough for you?

975
00:51:13.518 --> 00:51:15.244
- Could use a little
more lumbar support.

976
00:51:15.313 --> 00:51:16.832
but it's okay. why?

977
00:51:17.833 --> 00:51:19.869
- I wouldn't get too
comfortable if I were you.

978
00:51:19.938 --> 00:51:22.424
You might not be sitting
there much longer.

979
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.531
- [Reporter] Cromer. Mr. Cromer!

980
00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.844
[reporters speaking
simultaneously]

981
00:51:28.913 --> 00:51:30.570
- Take it easy. take it easy.

982
00:51:30.639 --> 00:51:32.468
We would appreciate
it if all the media

983
00:51:32.537 --> 00:51:36.921
would give the parties
and their families

984
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.130
time to grieve in
this situation.

985
00:51:40.614 --> 00:51:41.443
Thank you.

986
00:51:42.168 --> 00:51:43.479
That will be all.

987
00:51:43.548 --> 00:51:47.863
[reporters speaking
simultaneously]

988
00:52:05.087 --> 00:52:05.950
- Can I help you?

989
00:52:06.019 --> 00:52:07.469
- Yes. I--

990
00:52:07.538 --> 00:52:09.816
- We're looking for
Sharon Blackwell's room.

991
00:52:11.576 --> 00:52:14.234
- She's in ICU. sixth floor.

992
00:52:14.303 --> 00:52:15.649
- Appreciate it.

993
00:52:15.718 --> 00:52:17.858
- Hey. haven't I
seen you on the news?

994
00:52:17.927 --> 00:52:20.171
- Come on. guys. let
me escort you up.

995
00:52:39.363 --> 00:52:40.536
- Can I help you?

996
00:52:42.469 --> 00:52:44.609
- I'm Benjamin--
- Yeah. I know who you are.

997
00:52:44.678 --> 00:52:46.887
You're the one who did
this to my little girl.

998
00:52:46.956 --> 00:52:48.095
- Yes.

999
00:52:48.165 --> 00:52:50.305
- I'm the attorney
for the parents.

1000
00:52:50.374 --> 00:52:53.411
Anything you have to say
to them. you can say to me.

1001
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.964
I'm here for their protection.

1002
00:52:58.485 --> 00:53:00.073
- I just wanted to see if
there's anything I can do--

1003
00:53:00.142 --> 00:53:02.317
- You'll find no catharsis here.

1004
00:53:02.386 --> 00:53:04.664
- Ooh. are we okay here?

1005
00:53:04.733 --> 00:53:05.630
- We're all right.

1006
00:53:06.907 --> 00:53:09.841
What you have done to this
poor child is unforgivable.

1007
00:53:11.947 --> 00:53:14.294
Now. I'm gonna need you both
to give this family some space.

1008
00:53:14.363 --> 00:53:16.883
We'll see you in court.

1009
00:53:19.403 --> 00:53:21.025
Are those even real?

1010
00:53:21.094 --> 00:53:21.922
Thanks anyway.

1011
00:53:22.682 --> 00:53:24.166
- I'm so sorry. we didn't--

1012
00:53:24.235 --> 00:53:25.202
- Honey.

1013
00:53:25.271 --> 00:53:28.998
[melancholic pensive music]

1014
00:53:32.485 --> 00:53:33.624
- I don't enjoy doing this.

1015
00:53:33.693 --> 00:53:35.833
It's the worst part of my job.

1016
00:53:35.902 --> 00:53:38.145
If we don't handle this now.
we'll regret it down the road.

1017
00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:39.733
and so will your family.

1018
00:53:39.802 --> 00:53:41.287
This will ensure that I
can protect your rights

1019
00:53:41.356 --> 00:53:42.598
when things get ugly.

1020
00:53:44.186 --> 00:53:45.774
- What do you mean ugly?

1021
00:53:45.843 --> 00:53:47.362
- This isn't your first
time through this.

1022
00:53:47.431 --> 00:53:49.847
You know what those
hospital bills look like.

1023
00:53:49.916 --> 00:53:51.469
Is it fair to your
wife that you leave her

1024
00:53:51.538 --> 00:53:53.022
without a roof over her head?

1025
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:57.026
- Oh. this guy was insured.

1026
00:53:58.338 --> 00:54:00.409
We're not vindictive.
we don't sue.

1027
00:54:01.617 --> 00:54:04.068
- Yeah. but even the
Bible says that a shepherd

1028
00:54:04.137 --> 00:54:06.346
needs to protect his
flock from the wolves.

1029
00:54:06.415 --> 00:54:10.177
and right now. the wolves
are. [knocking on table]

1030
00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:11.765
are knockin' at your door.

1031
00:54:14.837 --> 00:54:16.908
- Yeah. well. what do
you get out of this?

1032
00:54:16.977 --> 00:54:18.358
- Oh. no. sir.

1033
00:54:18.427 --> 00:54:20.464
No. sir. I don't
take an upfront fee.

1034
00:54:21.188 --> 00:54:22.811
I get paid when you get paid.

1035
00:54:24.191 --> 00:54:25.676
I just wanna see you blessed.

1036
00:54:27.056 --> 00:54:29.162
But a workman is
worthy of his wages.

1037
00:54:29.231 --> 00:54:30.922
I know you can attest to that.

1038
00:54:30.991 --> 00:54:33.891
Right now. though. my
number-one priority

1039
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.721
is to make sure your family's
not left high and dry.

1040
00:54:38.896 --> 00:54:43.521
- Yeah. but look. I'm still
on the fence about this.

1041
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:47.594
- Okay. okay. but look. the
aggressor here. don't forget.

1042
00:54:47.663 --> 00:54:50.942
works at one of the largest
law firms in the state.

1043
00:54:51.011 --> 00:54:53.980
We can sue the company as
well for gross negligence.

1044
00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:57.052
By then. we're in the
seven. eight figures easily.

1045
00:54:57.121 --> 00:55:00.400
Look. I know what
you're thinkin'. but
I have a philosophy.

1046
00:55:01.436 --> 00:55:05.094
from the Bible in
1 Timothy 6:10.

1047
00:55:06.268 --> 00:55:08.822
It's not money that's evil.

1048
00:55:08.891 --> 00:55:10.928
It's the love of money. the
Bible actually says that.

1049
00:55:10.997 --> 00:55:13.448
You gotta just keep
it in its right place.

1050
00:55:14.552 --> 00:55:16.071
- Yeah. I hear you.

1051
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:16.968
- Good. good.

1052
00:55:18.798 --> 00:55:20.627
I'll get you the
contract through email

1053
00:55:20.696 --> 00:55:22.111
and we'll take it from there.

1054
00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:28.325
[door bell rings]

1055
00:55:50.519 --> 00:55:52.487
- I don't wanna go. Daddy.

1056
00:55:52.556 --> 00:55:53.833
- We'll be together soon.

1057
00:55:53.902 --> 00:55:55.524
It's for the best.

1058
00:55:55.593 --> 00:55:57.112
- Conner. did you
pack underwear?

1059
00:55:57.181 --> 00:55:59.183
- I know how to pack. Mom.

1060
00:55:59.252 --> 00:56:00.218
Thanks.

1061
00:56:00.287 --> 00:56:01.737
- Remember how to get there?

1062
00:56:01.806 --> 00:56:03.256
- Yup. do you know what
I did with my keys?

1063
00:56:03.325 --> 00:56:04.153
- Yeah.

1064
00:56:05.914 --> 00:56:07.571
- Come with us. I don't
think you should stay here.

1065
00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.951
It's too dangerous.

1066
00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:09.849
- I'll be fine.

1067
00:56:16.131 --> 00:56:17.960
- I don't like leaving you.

1068
00:56:18.029 --> 00:56:19.928
- I don't like
leaving you either.

1069
00:56:21.585 --> 00:56:23.241
- We'll be together soon.

1070
00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:24.173
- No matter what?

1071
00:56:25.451 --> 00:56:27.142
- No matter what.

1072
00:56:27.211 --> 00:56:30.041
[birds chirping]

1073
00:56:57.344 --> 00:56:58.932
- I'm sorry to have to say this.

1074
00:57:00.831 --> 00:57:03.212
but there's absolutely
nothing that we can do.

1075
00:57:04.075 --> 00:57:05.732
Tests don't reveal
any brain activity.

1076
00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:08.597
and machines are the only
thing keepin' her alive.

1077
00:57:10.288 --> 00:57:11.220
I'm sorry.

1078
00:57:12.359 --> 00:57:14.223
[respirator hissing]

1079
00:57:14.292 --> 00:57:15.777
- What do you mean you're sorry?

1080
00:57:15.846 --> 00:57:17.157
There's gotta be
something else you can do!

1081
00:57:17.226 --> 00:57:18.780
This is a hospital!

1082
00:57:21.299 --> 00:57:24.233
[respirator hissing]

1083
00:57:35.382 --> 00:57:38.800
[clock ticking softly]

1084
00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:56.887
- Hope you don't
mind. I let myself in.

1085
00:57:57.612 --> 00:57:59.027
- I don't mind at all.

1086
00:58:00.442 --> 00:58:01.719
- Had a talk with the DA today.

1087
00:58:01.788 --> 00:58:04.998
Things are not as we'd wish.

1088
00:58:06.344 --> 00:58:07.276
- Why are you here?

1089
00:58:09.416 --> 00:58:11.108
- Did you hear what I said?

1090
00:58:11.177 --> 00:58:14.594
[soft melancholic music]

1091
00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.564
- [Benjamin] Courtesy
of your friends.

1092
00:58:22.395 --> 00:58:23.292
- Where's your family?

1093
00:58:26.433 --> 00:58:27.262
- They're safe.

1094
00:58:28.746 --> 00:58:30.230
- I'm glad to hear that.

1095
00:58:30.299 --> 00:58:33.268
- If you came here for your
confidentiality agreement.

1096
00:58:33.337 --> 00:58:34.821
you can go.

1097
00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:36.443
I'm not signin' anything.

1098
00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:39.274
- I don't know anything about
a confidentiality agreement.

1099
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:42.588
Look. if you need money.
you can always ask.

1100
00:58:42.657 --> 00:58:44.831
- What are you talking about?

1101
00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:46.315
- I'm concerned about you.

1102
00:58:46.384 --> 00:58:47.869
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1103
00:58:49.077 --> 00:58:51.355
I'm on your side. Benjamin.
you should know that.

1104
00:58:51.424 --> 00:58:55.290
- 'Cause you're trying to
protect your interests?

1105
00:58:55.359 --> 00:58:56.912
- That's right.

1106
00:58:56.981 --> 00:58:59.087
You're workin' with me now.

1107
00:58:59.156 --> 00:59:02.573
Benjamin. I know you're a good
man. and you made a mistake.

1108
00:59:02.642 --> 00:59:04.333
Now you think your life is over.

1109
00:59:05.265 --> 00:59:06.094
It's not.

1110
00:59:07.371 --> 00:59:10.339
But you need to be strong now
for your wife and your kids.

1111
00:59:10.408 --> 00:59:13.446
See. they're carrying
this burden with you.

1112
00:59:13.515 --> 00:59:15.344
They need you now
more than ever.

1113
00:59:16.863 --> 00:59:19.659
- How can I be there for
my family if I'm in prison?

1114
00:59:20.764 --> 00:59:22.075
- Look at me. Benjamin.

1115
00:59:24.457 --> 00:59:27.011
I chose to build an
empire over my family.

1116
00:59:28.461 --> 00:59:29.773
Now I'm old and rich.

1117
00:59:31.291 --> 00:59:33.190
and I'm alone.

1118
00:59:33.259 --> 00:59:36.089
You ever see a hearse luggin'
a U-Haul full of money?

1119
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:39.368
I would trade it
all in a heartbeat

1120
00:59:41.301 --> 00:59:42.717
to have a home to go back to.

1121
00:59:43.856 --> 00:59:46.134
for one moment to
have my family back.

1122
00:59:48.067 --> 00:59:50.241
We're not guaranteed
another day.

1123
00:59:51.898 --> 00:59:53.175
but we have today.

1124
00:59:55.937 --> 00:59:58.111
And your family needs
you now. Benjamin.

1125
00:59:59.319 --> 01:00:00.182
Be strong.

1126
01:00:01.528 --> 01:00:03.013
strong for your family.

1127
01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:08.259
Read that.

1128
01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:10.572
Might do you some good.

1129
01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:14.403
[melancholic pensive music]

1130
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:24.206
[respirator hissing]
[Jennie humming]

1131
01:00:26.519 --> 01:00:29.349
[Jennie mumbling]

1132
01:00:37.323 --> 01:00:38.117
- Honey.

1133
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.776
you remember Mr. Layson.

1134
01:00:41.845 --> 01:00:43.432
He wanted to check on Sharon.

1135
01:00:46.228 --> 01:00:48.645
- Why is that guy always
sniffin' around here?

1136
01:00:50.577 --> 01:00:51.509
- He's representing us.

1137
01:00:51.578 --> 01:00:55.375
[respirator hissing]

1138
01:00:55.444 --> 01:00:56.445
- We don't need a lawyer.

1139
01:00:58.033 --> 01:00:59.448
Our daughter needs us.

1140
01:01:00.622 --> 01:01:02.279
Why don't you call our pastor?

1141
01:01:03.073 --> 01:01:04.764
- Jennie. I'm unemployed.

1142
01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:08.009
Welfare barely gives us
enough to make the bills.

1143
01:01:08.078 --> 01:01:10.011
and who's gonna
pay for all this?

1144
01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.978
We sure can't afford it.

1145
01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:14.256
That's what Larry's
here to help us with.

1146
01:01:16.431 --> 01:01:17.466
- Then you deal with him.

1147
01:01:18.605 --> 01:01:19.503
I'm busy.

1148
01:01:19.572 --> 01:01:22.402
[respirator hissing]

1149
01:01:22.471 --> 01:01:23.472
- Okay.

1150
01:01:23.541 --> 01:01:24.473
- Shall we?

1151
01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:27.580
Nice meetin' you.

1152
01:01:27.649 --> 01:01:29.651
[respirator hissing]

1153
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.135
I'm not focused on the money.

1154
01:01:31.204 --> 01:01:32.930
I'm focused on seein'
your family prosper.

1155
01:01:32.999 --> 01:01:34.898
One second. so many hurtin'
people in the world.

1156
01:01:34.967 --> 01:01:36.865
Just call Larry.

1157
01:01:36.934 --> 01:01:38.453
I know it's a hard
pill to swallow.

1158
01:01:38.522 --> 01:01:41.387
but we gotta prepare for
the worst just in case.

1159
01:01:41.456 --> 01:01:45.391
Now. if she lives. it's
a harder case to make.

1160
01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.359
but we'll swing for
the fences regardless.

1161
01:01:48.428 --> 01:01:50.948
I think we should go ahead and
file. it's been long enough.

1162
01:01:51.017 --> 01:01:53.986
Thing is. nobody likes to go
to court and sign legal papers

1163
01:01:54.055 --> 01:01:55.608
while preparin' for a funeral.

1164
01:01:55.677 --> 01:01:59.854
It's time. we need to build
the ark before the storm hits.

1165
01:02:04.582 --> 01:02:05.963
[knocking on door]

1166
01:02:06.032 --> 01:02:07.413
- Look. I don't have to tell you

1167
01:02:07.482 --> 01:02:10.174
the entire state's
lookin' at this case.

1168
01:02:10.243 --> 01:02:12.073
I have an interview on
primetime this evenin'

1169
01:02:12.142 --> 01:02:13.833
about texting and driving.

1170
01:02:13.902 --> 01:02:14.869
How do I look?

1171
01:02:14.938 --> 01:02:15.973
Oh. never mind.

1172
01:02:16.042 --> 01:02:17.561
- His superior. Michael Durwood.

1173
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:19.770
gave me his personal assurance
Stills would be comin' in.

1174
01:02:19.839 --> 01:02:21.151
It's taken care of.

1175
01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.152
- [District Attorney]
Let's hit it.

1176
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:26.225
- [Michael] He'll
be here any minute.

1177
01:02:26.294 --> 01:02:28.434
- Good. let's get
this over with.

1178
01:02:28.503 --> 01:02:32.024
- This is how we're repaid.
stealin' from the company.

1179
01:02:32.093 --> 01:02:35.303
[scoffs] You know what gets me?

1180
01:02:35.372 --> 01:02:37.823
He's workin' under
my nose every day.

1181
01:02:38.824 --> 01:02:41.102
I mean. I never saw it comin'.

1182
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:43.621
Oh. guys. this is unbelievable.

1183
01:02:44.657 --> 01:02:48.385
- It appears that he's
been nesting millions

1184
01:02:48.454 --> 01:02:50.939
in an unidentified
Cayman's account.

1185
01:02:52.527 --> 01:02:54.805
- Well. that's a travesty.

1186
01:02:54.874 --> 01:02:56.013
See. now.

1187
01:02:58.084 --> 01:02:59.258
that is a travesty.

1188
01:03:05.471 --> 01:03:08.750
- [Doug] Oh. I can't
take this anymore.

1189
01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:09.924
- Well. maybe if
you prayed more.

1190
01:03:09.993 --> 01:03:12.685
you'd know she's a fighter.

1191
01:03:12.754 --> 01:03:14.411
- I know she's a
fighter. Jennie.

1192
01:03:15.446 --> 01:03:17.310
I was there for the
chemo too. remember?

1193
01:03:18.622 --> 01:03:19.968
And you want me to pray more?

1194
01:03:20.037 --> 01:03:21.487
You want me to pray for what?

1195
01:03:21.556 --> 01:03:23.213
Want me to pray that our
daughter doesn't get cancer.

1196
01:03:23.282 --> 01:03:25.215
that she doesn't
get hit by a car?

1197
01:03:26.492 --> 01:03:28.597
'Cause I don't know
what to do anymore.

1198
01:03:31.911 --> 01:03:33.326
It's time to say goodbye.

1199
01:03:35.984 --> 01:03:36.985
- Fine.

1200
01:03:40.471 --> 01:03:43.992
- Guys. I'm your pastor.
and I'm here to support you.

1201
01:03:44.061 --> 01:03:46.615
but are you sure this is
what God wants you to do?

1202
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:49.239
- [Jennie] No.

1203
01:03:49.308 --> 01:03:52.552
- I mean. listen. once
you make this choice.

1204
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:54.347
there's no undoing it.

1205
01:03:54.416 --> 01:03:56.729
I just think you
need to pray about it

1206
01:03:56.798 --> 01:03:59.145
and give God room to be God.

1207
01:04:02.597 --> 01:04:03.563
- I can't do this.

1208
01:04:04.288 --> 01:04:05.634
I'm not doing this today.

1209
01:04:06.773 --> 01:04:08.361
I think I need a minute.

1210
01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.021
- I miss Daddy.

1211
01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:14.471
- I miss him too. honey.

1212
01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:16.991
- Just not enough to
stick it through with him.

1213
01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.579
Face it. you're
weak and selfish!

1214
01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:23.376
- Conner. don't talk to
your mother like that!

1215
01:04:23.445 --> 01:04:24.481
- Conner. sit.

1216
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:26.448
Sit.

1217
01:04:26.517 --> 01:04:27.587
Lori. honey. you too.

1218
01:04:32.765 --> 01:04:35.526
I would like for all
of us to say a prayer

1219
01:04:35.595 --> 01:04:38.564
for the little girl who's
in hospital. Sharon.

1220
01:04:39.737 --> 01:04:41.670
and pray that she
will be healed.

1221
01:04:41.739 --> 01:04:43.638
- [Lori] Do you
think it'll work?

1222
01:04:43.707 --> 01:04:45.536
- I think it just might.

1223
01:04:47.435 --> 01:04:48.263
- Conner!

1224
01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:53.579
- [Larry] What'd
Dr. Stevens say?

1225
01:04:53.648 --> 01:04:55.995
- I don't know if we're
doin' the right thing here.

1226
01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:57.894
Somethin' doesn't feel right.

1227
01:04:57.963 --> 01:04:58.998
I don't know if I can do this.

1228
01:04:59.067 --> 01:05:00.758
- Gotta do what's in your heart.

1229
01:05:00.827 --> 01:05:02.933
What's your heart tellin' you?

1230
01:05:03.002 --> 01:05:04.555
- If my baby girl dies--

1231
01:05:04.624 --> 01:05:05.453
- Not if.

1232
01:05:06.178 --> 01:05:07.731
Your heart.

1233

- I'm angry!

1234
01:05:09.629 --> 01:05:11.148
I'm angry that my
daughter's suffering

1235
01:05:11.217 --> 01:05:12.563
and there's nothin'
I can do about it.

1236
01:05:12.632 --> 01:05:14.980
and I'm angry about
everything. the situation.

1237
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:16.050
- [Larry] I'm
representin' you now.

1238
01:05:16.119 --> 01:05:17.534
You let me handle this.

1239
01:05:17.603 --> 01:05:20.261
You want to see the
man pay. who did this.

1240
01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:22.504
same man who protects
those monsters.

1241
01:05:22.573 --> 01:05:25.266
Took your job and your
family away from you.

1242
01:05:26.888 --> 01:05:29.235

Anything I should know about?

1247
01:05:49.014 --> 01:05:50.843
- Durwood wants you upstairs.

1248

This is gonna be very short.

These officers are
here to take you in

and they'll explain
everything to you.

1256

you. Benjamin?

I mean. after all
we've done for you.

I don't know what to say.

1259
01:06:51.076 --> 01:06:53.147
- Wait. what's this about?

1260
01:06:53.216 --> 01:06:55.666
- Your text messages
confirmed an illegal transfer

1261
01:06:55.735 --> 01:06:57.427
of company money to
an offshore account

1262
01:06:57.496 --> 01:06:59.187
at the time of your accident.

1263

in the Caymans. but ooh.

got in a little
accident. didn't we?

1266
01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:08.852
- Look. our forensics
team has all this.

1267
01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:10.026
Can we wrap this up?

1268
01:07:10.095 --> 01:07:11.579
- This isn't what it looks like!

1269
01:07:11.648 --> 01:07:13.822

01:07:33.325 --> 01:07:36.293
I'm telling you for the
last time it's not smart

1280
01:07:36.362 --> 01:07:37.570
to ignore your mother!

1281
01:07:37.639 --> 01:07:40.056
You'll see. you'll
regret it one day.

You'll see. you'll
regret it one day.

going to be here!

1286

[soft tense music]

1292
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:10.569
- Mr. Cromer. I may
need a few things.

[warm pensive music]

1353
01:12:28.654 --> 01:12:30.829

of fact. I got a call

1354
01:12:30.898 --> 01:12:33.003
from my old pledge
mate. state's attorney.

1355
01:12:33.072 --> 01:12:34.557
- Once the DA?

1356
01:12:34.626 --> 01:12:36.731

the girl's off life support.

What's wrong?

1359
01:12:46.051 --> 01:12:49.157
- That little girl and
my daughter were friends.

1360
01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:54.439
Her father worked for Lancer
and was recently terminated.

1361
01:12:56.233 --> 01:12:58.166
- Yeah. that is unfortunate.

1362
01:13:00.065 --> 01:13:01.963
- Lancer's still our
number-one client?

1363
01:13:02.032 --> 01:13:03.102
- Oh. yeah. yeah.

1364
01:13:04.207 --> 01:13:06.968

if you could get his job back.

1365
01:13:07.037 --> 01:13:11.456
no termination clause. full
benefits. all retroactive?

1366
01:13:12.215 --> 01:13:13.389
- I'll look into it.

1367
01:13:14.769 --> 01:13:16.046
- I'd appreciate that.

1368
01:13:18.324 --> 01:13:20.085

family. Benjamin.

You will regret ever
calling this house.

Of that. you can be sure!

1382

What are you doing here?

1384
01:13:56.984 --> 01:13:58.537
You're not supposed to be here!

1385
01:13:58.606 --> 01:14:00.539
And how did those
monsters find this number?

1386

- [Benjamin] What are
you talkin' about?

1387

lives are in danger.

1388

- No. that's what I
came here to tell you.

1389
01:14:07.615 --> 01:14:08.996
She's gonna be fine.

1390
01:14:09.928 --> 01:14:12.171
- You have to go. that's
how they found us.

1391
01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.587
They were following you.

1392
01:14:13.656 --> 01:14:15.105
- No. nobody's
followin' me. all right?

1393
01:14:15.865 --> 01:14:18.350
Beth. she's gonna live.

1394

She's gonna live.

1395
01:14:20.525 --> 01:14:21.526
- Oh.

1396
01:14:25.115 --> 01:14:27.221
- [Jack] Well. I expect
you heard from my friends.

1397
01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:29.050
or you wouldn't be calling.

1398
01:14:29.119 --> 01:14:31.225

Well. your man is lucky.

1399

1401
01:14:34.331 --> 01:14:35.712
from the state. and I
was waitin' to charge him

1402
01:14:35.781 --> 01:14:37.852
until after the investigation.

1403
01:14:37.921 --> 01:14:39.716
The report indicates
that although

1404
01:14:39.785 --> 01:14:42.063
there was texting
involved prior to--

1405
01:14:42.132 --> 01:14:43.824
- Get to the point.

1406
01:14:43.893 --> 01:14:45.342
- [District Attorney]
We will not be pursuing

1407
01:14:45.411 --> 01:14:48.069
any charges at this time.

1408
01:14:48.138 --> 01:14:48.967
- Good.

1409
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:54.179
Good.

1410
01:15:04.258 --> 01:15:05.086
- Ms. Blackwell.

1411
01:15:06.156 --> 01:15:07.848
- We--
- I know who you are.

1412
01:15:08.987 --> 01:15:10.298
- Is your husband here?

1413
01:15:12.093 --> 01:15:12.887
- I don't know.

1414
01:15:14.061 --> 01:15:15.407
I can check.

1415
01:15:15.476 --> 01:15:18.203
- Can we see her?

1416
01:15:18.272 --> 01:15:21.033
- Honey. I don't think
they're ready for that.

1417
01:15:21.102 --> 01:15:22.587
- No. it's okay.

1418
01:15:22.656 --> 01:15:23.657
It's okay.

1419
01:15:26.418 --> 01:15:27.833
God tells me to forgive.

1420
01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.630
Do I want to?

1421
01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:33.321
Maybe not.

1422
01:15:34.495 --> 01:15:36.290
But I know she would want me to.

1423
01:15:38.188 --> 01:15:39.949
- I know there's
nothin' I can say

1424
01:15:40.018 --> 01:15:42.261
that can change
what happened. but

1425
01:15:44.367 --> 01:15:46.990
I know that God wanted
me to come here today.

1426
01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.062
- [Doug] Well. congratulations.

1427
01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:57.345
- I know I'm the last
person that you wanna see.

1428
01:15:59.485 --> 01:16:01.349
- So God told you
to come here. huh?

1429
01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.145
Yeah. I heard what you said.

1430
01:16:06.009 --> 01:16:08.115
So glad you could have
your come-to-Jesus moment

1431
01:16:08.184 --> 01:16:10.117
while nearly killing
my little girl.

1432
01:16:12.395 --> 01:16:14.431
And here you are with your Bible

1433
01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.261
and your little stuffed animal.

1434
01:16:17.503 --> 01:16:18.366
And now what?

1435
01:16:19.367 --> 01:16:22.060
What. you go off and do
some kind of penance.

1436
01:16:22.129 --> 01:16:25.891
some thing to make yourself
feel better for what you did?

1437
01:16:28.411 --> 01:16:30.516
That's great. but you know what?

1438
01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:34.037
When this is all over for
us. and the lights go down.

1439
01:16:34.106 --> 01:16:36.384
and then they boot us
out of this hospital.

1440
01:16:37.351 --> 01:16:39.387
we're gonna be out there
with a broken child.

1441
01:16:40.319 --> 01:16:42.356
traumatized for the
rest of her life.

1442
01:16:44.979 --> 01:16:47.568
Why don't you take your
stuff and whatever it is

1443
01:16:47.637 --> 01:16:50.122
you came to say.
and just get out.

1444
01:16:51.952 --> 01:16:54.402
- You have every right
to be angry. all right?

1445
01:16:57.405 --> 01:16:59.994
I think you know that my law
firm represented the company

1446
01:17:00.063 --> 01:17:01.340
you used to work for.

1447
01:17:05.517 --> 01:17:08.416
Want you to know you
have your job back.

1448
01:17:09.901 --> 01:17:11.765
You've been reinstated
with full benefits

1449
01:17:11.834 --> 01:17:14.353
for you and your
daughter. all retroactive.

1450
01:17:15.561 --> 01:17:17.115
Everything's gonna
be taken care of.

1451
01:17:18.599 --> 01:17:19.911
- I don't know what to say.

1452
01:17:20.705 --> 01:17:23.190
Thank you. thank you.

1453
01:17:23.259 --> 01:17:24.087
We need this.

1454
01:17:25.468 --> 01:17:26.434
We need this.

1455
01:17:31.163 --> 01:17:34.546
Well. I have a
hungry little girl.

1456
01:17:34.615 --> 01:17:36.065
Would you like to come meet her.

1457
01:17:44.073 --> 01:17:46.454
Baby girl. I'd like to
introduce you to someone.

1458
01:17:48.525 --> 01:17:49.768
- Hi.

1459
01:17:49.837 --> 01:17:51.218
- I remember you!

1460
01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:53.841
- [Benjamin] You do?

1461
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:55.429
- You're Lori's dad.

1462
01:17:56.706 --> 01:17:57.707
- That's right.

1463
01:17:58.846 --> 01:18:01.331
- Are you the man that
I hit with my bike?

1464
01:18:02.608 --> 01:18:06.854
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to hurt your car.

1465
01:18:08.511 --> 01:18:09.926
- No. no. that was my.

1466
01:18:12.446 --> 01:18:13.827
yes.

1467
01:18:13.896 --> 01:18:14.862
That was me.

1468
01:18:16.519 --> 01:18:19.177
- You don't have to feel
bad about that. you know.

1469
01:18:21.455 --> 01:18:22.283
- Okay.

1470
01:18:27.841 --> 01:18:29.497
Lori wanted you to have this.

1471
01:18:31.983 --> 01:18:33.294
She drew it for you.

1472
01:18:40.094 --> 01:18:41.958
- I don't mean to interrupt.

1473
01:18:42.027 --> 01:18:43.477
She needs her rest.

1474
01:18:44.547 --> 01:18:48.309
- Baby girl. say goodbye
to Mr. Benjamin. okay?

1475
01:18:48.378 --> 01:18:51.209
[soft warm music]

1476
01:19:07.466 --> 01:19:08.951
- [Conner] Dad!

1477
01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.193
- [Benjamin] Hey. wait.
wait. wait. wait. wait. wait!

1478
01:19:10.262 --> 01:19:10.953
- What?
- Right here. wait.

1479
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:15.440
- [sighs] We just can't
get away from this thing.

1480
01:19:15.509 --> 01:19:16.855
- I'll be brief.

1481
01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:18.374
Hey. make sure you
got all your stuff.

1482
01:19:18.443 --> 01:19:20.376
Don't leave anything behind
at Grandma's this time.

1483
01:19:20.445 --> 01:19:21.377
Hello?

1484
01:19:21.446 --> 01:19:22.585
- Hey there. Benjamin.

1485
01:19:22.654 --> 01:19:23.828
I thought I might
reach you here.

1486
01:19:23.897 --> 01:19:25.139
- Hello. Mr. Cromer.

1487
01:19:25.208 --> 01:19:26.658
- [Jack] Get ready
for the big trip?

1488
01:19:26.727 --> 01:19:29.419
- We're tryin' to. we're
just about to leave.

1489
01:19:29.488 --> 01:19:31.352
- Listen. Benjamin.
I know what I said.

1490
01:19:31.421 --> 01:19:35.253
but there's a case just
came across my desk.

1491
01:19:35.322 --> 01:19:36.979
It is huge.

1492
01:19:37.048 --> 01:19:40.741
I'd really like to tag
team this with you.

1493
01:19:41.742 --> 01:19:44.158
You know. maybe postpone
that trip just a week.

1494
01:19:44.227 --> 01:19:46.574
I'll send a chopper out
there and pick you up.

1495
01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:48.611
- As tempting as that may be--

1496
01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.888
- Just be for a week.

1497
01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.684
I'll give you my plane after
and you can take your family

1498
01:19:52.753 --> 01:19:56.481
for a camping trip or
the Bahamas if you want.

1499
01:19:59.001 --> 01:20:01.417
- Just how big a case
are we talkin' about?

1500
01:20:01.486 --> 01:20:05.041
- You think I'd be offering
all of this if it wasn't huge?

1501
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:08.079
Might be a partnership
in it for you.

1502
01:20:10.426 --> 01:20:12.877
- [Benjamin] No. my
family has to come first.

1503
01:20:12.946 --> 01:20:14.568
I'll talk to you
soon. Mr. Cromer.

1504
01:20:14.637 --> 01:20:15.465
- I see.

1505
01:20:20.988 --> 01:20:22.196
- Come on. Dad.

1506
01:20:22.265 --> 01:20:27.339
- [Benjamin] Let's
hit it! [exhales]

1507
01:20:31.723 --> 01:20:35.900
[playful video game music]

1508
01:20:35.969 --> 01:20:39.213
[cell phone ringing]

1509
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:41.491
[cell phone vibrating]
- [Lori] What's going on?

1510
01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.838
- [Conner] Dad?

1511
01:20:42.907 --> 01:20:44.356
[cell phone ringing
and vibrating]

1512
01:20:44.425 --> 01:20:45.910
- This is a family trip.
and we're a family.

1513
01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.499
and these things.
as cool as they are.

1514
01:20:49.568 --> 01:20:50.846
they're just a distraction.

1515
01:20:52.157 --> 01:20:53.538
So I'm gonna power mine down
and throw it in the back.

1516
01:20:53.607 --> 01:20:54.608
Who's with me?

1517
01:20:54.677 --> 01:20:55.471
- [Lori] I'm with you. Daddy.

1518
01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:57.059
- Okay. I'm game.

1519
01:20:58.715 --> 01:20:59.613
- [Conner] Come on!

1520
01:21:04.238 --> 01:21:05.930
- I'm so proud of you.

1521
01:21:05.999 --> 01:21:07.172
- Hey. all right.

1522
01:21:07.241 --> 01:21:08.449
- Why are we doing this. Dad?

1523
01:21:08.518 --> 01:21:09.657
- Come on. put it in!

1524
01:21:09.726 --> 01:21:10.900
- Come on. Conner.
you can do it.

1525
01:21:10.969 --> 01:21:12.764
- All right.
- I told you Dad

1526
01:21:12.833 --> 01:21:13.938
was gonna take us camping.

1527
01:21:14.007 --> 01:21:14.939
- That's right. here we go.

1528
01:21:15.008 --> 01:21:16.906
Oh. last one. come on.

1529
01:21:16.975 --> 01:21:19.495
- [groans] You got me.

1530
01:21:19.564 --> 01:21:21.669
- Yeah. some day.
you're gonna thank me.

1531
01:21:23.533 --> 01:21:24.638
Let's go!

1532
01:21:24.707 --> 01:21:25.535
- Dad.

1533
01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:29.712
I love you.

1534

[warm music]

1535
01:21:33.578 --> 01:21:34.959
- I love you too.

1536
01:21:37.064 --> 01:21:38.031
Let's go.

[warm orchestral music]

1538
01:21:39.170 --> 01:21:40.550
- [Conner] Let's go camping!

1539
01:21:40.619 --> 01:21:41.448
- Yeah!

1540
01:21:42.759 --> 01:21:43.726
Buckle up.

1541

[warm orchestral music]

1542
01:21:45.866 --> 01:21:46.832
Here we go!
