3
00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:36.514
Always by my side. Always!

4
00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.933
I just can't believe I'm doing this.

5
00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:41.602
we should have kept on scamming tourists
and be done.

6
00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:43.229
Do you want me to explain again?

7
00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.690
These snakeskins are worth more than
the purses and wallets that you steal.

8
00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.651
I don't care about that.

9
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.486
Look. it’s suicide to be here.

10
00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:52.571
It’s suicide because you don’t do what I tell
you to do.

11
00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:54.323
- By my side!
- No. I said no.

12
00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:56.826
It’s insane to be hunting at a place like this.

13
00:01:56.992 --> 00:01:58.619
I’m not afraid of Las Arenas.

14
00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:00.538
Well. I am. so what?

15
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:04.208
- See that? Bye!
- Stay here! Stay!

16
00:52:12.713 --> 00:52:15.591
Hey. hey! look at me.

17
00:52:17.343 --> 00:52:18.886
Are my friends alive?

18
00:52:22.306 --> 00:52:23.724
Do you want money?

19
00:52:26.519 --> 00:52:29.689
I’ve got 200 dollars. If you want them.
they are yours but tell me where they are.

20
00:52:32.233 --> 00:52:33.359
Hand them over.

21
00:52:34.235 --> 00:52:35.862
They are upstairs in my bag.

22
00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:39.991
When we get out of here I’ll tell the police
this was all a misunderstanding.

23
00:52:39.991 --> 00:52:41.951
I made a mistake and then I give you the money.

24
00:52:45.454 --> 00:52:46.956
Give me that watch.

25
00:52:54.005 --> 00:52:55.840
It was my dad’s.

26
00:52:57.633 --> 00:52:59.093
Then don’t give me anything.

27
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.935
This is worth a lot. you better start talking.

28
00:53:14.483 --> 00:53:15.902
A week ago.

29
00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:19.864
I was hunting snakes.

30
00:53:21.365 --> 00:53:22.617
Snakes?

31
00:53:24.076 --> 00:53:24.785
Yes.

32
00:53:25.786 --> 00:53:28.289
venom is well paid. Skins too.

33
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.833
I was at Las Arenas.

34
00:53:32.001 --> 00:53:33.419
Is that where they are?

35
00:53:35.338 --> 00:53:36.881
That’s where I saw them.

36
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:38.883
But they are alright.

37
00:53:39.842 --> 00:53:41.802
Do you know why it’s called Las Arenas?

38
00:53:44.263 --> 00:53:47.642
That place is called Las Arenas
because there’s a lot of quicksands.

39
00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:52.104
There’s no quicksand in this country;
that’s bullshit.

40
00:53:54.941 --> 00:53:57.777
Did you know I went hunting with a friend.
but I came back alone.

41
00:53:59.153 --> 00:54:01.238
If you don’t want to believe me.
it’s your problem.

42
00:54:02.156 --> 00:54:03.866
but they are in danger.

43
00:54:12.917 --> 00:54:14.251
Hey buddy.

44
00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:18.506
I'm a doctor; I organized the conference here;

45
00:54:18.714 --> 00:54:19.799
let me out.

46
00:54:20.383 --> 00:54:22.969
I mean it; my friends are in danger.

47
00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.054
If you want. call the manager.

48
00:54:26.222 --> 00:54:28.140
Let me out!
