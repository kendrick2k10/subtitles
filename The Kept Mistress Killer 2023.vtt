I hope you’ll forgive me
for not making pancakes.

32
00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:31.902
I made oatmeal instead.

the best pancakes.

quit? Too many secrets?

I’m calling security!

But that feels a little scary.

131
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.252
Yeah. Jackie’s been
very difficult.

132
00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.214
But I promise you. you’ll
never see her again.

133
00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.049
She’ll never even get
back in the building.

care of everyone here.

think you’re pretty special.

on the spot before.

Ah...

142
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.990
In the past. there was a lot
of focus in your portfolios

143
00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.956
on bespoke tranche
opportunities.

144
00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:58.076
And frankly. there’s
a better way.

145
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.090
It’s way less risky
and predatory.

146

We need to think
of the future here.

the second quarter.

to any of my assets

pulled a gun on us.

you’re lying about that.

of the company.

torn her case apart.

tear apart anything else

we’re bulletproof.

165
00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:42.462

Said they were very pleased
by your pitch this morning.

173
00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.355
they’ve already brought
in additional investors.

174
00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:02.232
I call this a
hole-in-one for you.

175

which is why I want
you to have this.

177
00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:17.372
This is a check for $10.000.

up to your expectations.

Oh. come on. You already have.

184
00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.302
You’ve got your finger
on the pulse. Catherine.

185
00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.557
your ethics are second to none.

186
00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:38.677
I think we’re gonna
do this deal too.

187
00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.106
Excellent job.

188
00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:45.016
-Thank you.
-Excellent.

189
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.953
So. any fun plans this evening?

[lighthearted jazz music]

191
00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.906
You know. I’ve gotta say. you
are a breath of fresh air.

192
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.619
especially after Jackie Reese.

193
00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.829
She was pathological.

194
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.120
Between us girls. she
had a thing for Paul too.

195
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.460
When he divorced Julia.

196
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.250
Jackie made her move. and
he shut her right down.

197
00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:07.255
[Catherine laughs]

198
00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.585
Wow. A shark and
a woman scorned?

199
00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:12.051
That’s a dangerous combination.

200
00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.512
Oh. but Jackie’s no one to
worry about. believe me.

201
00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:15.847
She’ll bounce back
at a new firm.

202
00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.557
and lose her job
inside of a year.

203
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.177
She didn’t even last
eight months with us.

204
00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:22.235
Well. hello ladies.

205
00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.024
Paul. hi!

206
00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.691
It’s nice to see you again.

207
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:28.276
Good to see you again.

208
00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:31.486
Yeah. I had to come by
and meet with Lou Dryden.

209
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.157
He’s right back
there. impatient.

Would you like to meet him?

212
00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.452
I am pitching him your idea.

213
00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.247
You know what? I’ll
leave you guys to it.

214
00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.665
I need to get home anyway.

215
00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.075
So I will see you on
Monday. Catherine.

216
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.253

much for everything.

-How are you?
-Catherine.

225
00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:01.559
Nice to meet you.

Check. please.

227
00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.265
[Server] Yes. ma’am.

228
00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:06.689
So he’s quite a guy. huh?

229
00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:07.398
Yeah.

[Paul chuckles]

231
00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:10.693
I think he was really
taken with you.

232
00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:13.238
The deal’s all but done.

233
00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:16.198
You know. I’ve been in
finance a while now.

234
00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:19.285
and I gotta say.
this is a new one.

235
00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.285
I mean. usually your
boss just takes your idea

236
00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:22.577
and cashes it in.

237
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:26.376
Well. I believe in giving
credit where credit is due.

238
00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.585
And to be honest.

239
00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.125
I’m starting to wonder
what I’d do without you.

240

Please. I just got here.

241

Care for a toast?

242
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.636
It’s not a school
night after all.

243
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.846
Aren’t toasts usually
made with champagne?

244
00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.348
Yes. that’s usually
how it works.

245
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.140
Well...

246
00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:49.272
As lovely as this is.
it’s not champagne.

247
00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.069

great time tonight.

I had fun too.

I hope you’ll forgive me.

263
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.660
Look. I didn’t
wanna bring this up.

264
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.706
but I ran into somebody
in your lobby on Monday.

265
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:51.166
and she warned me about you.

Let me guess. Jackie
Reeves. right?

267
00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:54.125
Yeah.

her a second thought.

Well. yeah. I guess that’s true.

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:10.388
[ominous music]

366
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:17.351
I think that she thinks that
I should pump the brakes.

367
00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:19.437
Pump the brakes on what?

368
00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:20.267
On this.

369
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.651
[calming music]

370
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:31.529
Oh...

371
00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:32.450
Wow.

372
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.700
This has been such a whirlwind.

373
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:35.542
Yeah.

374
00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.538
You’ve been so generous.

375
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.126
I’m starting to feel
like a kept woman.

376
00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:43.166
[Catherine chuckles]

377
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:45.211
Oh. I want to be generous
with you. Catherine.

378
00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.422
You’ve earned it.

379
00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:48.299
Can never be
anyone’s kept woman.

380
00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.089
[Catherine chuckles]

381
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.719
Time to celebrate. people.

382
00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:52.549
Oh.

383
00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:54.506
Thank you.

384
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:58.099
And Catherine is the
rock star of the night.

385
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.560
Well. to Catherine.

386
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.640
To Catherine.

387
00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:01.395
[glasses clinking]

388
00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:02.435
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

389
00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:03.397
Well done.

390
00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:04.187
Thank you.

391
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.730
[Paul] Well done.

392
00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:09.067
Mm.

393
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.740
[ominous music]

394
00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:21.916
[mysterious music]

395
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.540
Ow.

396
00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:37.104
[Catherine grunts]

397
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:43.061
[mysterious music]

398
00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:50.941
Oh.

399
00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:08.548
[dramatic music]

400
00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:20.058
[Catherine breathes heavily]

401
00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:27.306
[Hailey] Okay. honey.
Everything’s gonna be okay.

402
00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.774
just try to stay calm.

403
00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.651
and tell them everything
you can recall.

404
00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:31.651
[Catherine] But that’s just it.

405
00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:33.738
I don’t remember anything.

406
00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:35.278
Did they talk to you yet?

407
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.821
No.

408
00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:38.492
Someone called saying that they
might be by to interview me.

409
00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:42.330
but I can come and get you
in a little while. okay?

410
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.789
No. Mom. I’ll get a ride share.

411
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:47.126
you stay there in
case the cops come by.

412
00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:49.956
Okay. honey. be brave.

413
00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:56.716
Okay. let’s go over it again.

414
00:18:56.719 --> 00:19:00.509
The party’s ending. it’s your
first visit to the place.

415
00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:03.726
You guys have a
nightcap. you get sleepy.

416
00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:05.556
and go to the guest room.

417
00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:06.651
That’s it.

418
00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.685
That’s all I remember.

419
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.860
And then you came down
the stairs at 10:00 AM.

420
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:16.111
and that’s when you
saw Ms. Burke’s body.

421
00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:19.116
[Catherine] Yeah. correct.

422
00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:21.576
And you didn’t hear anything?

423
00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:23.617
No sounds of a struggle?

424
00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.661
And you have no idea
why she would be here?

425
00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:28.501
Like I said. she just showed
up at my house yesterday

426
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.877
and confronted me.

427
00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:31.667
Maybe she followed me here.

428
00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:34.461
Maybe someone told her
I was here. I don’t...

429
00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:38.719
Well. her phone was taken.
so we can’t check that.

430
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:40.888
Did you talk to Paul or Pam?

431
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:43.098
They were both here last night.

432
00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.017
We haven’t been able
to reach Mr. Burke.

433
00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.847
He took a late flight to London.

434
00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:50.398
and we are looking into
the rest of that now.

435
00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.898
So we have your DNA
swab and hair sample.

436
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.200
I don’t think we need
anything else from you today.

437
00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:02.116
Looks like CSI is
gonna be a while.

438
00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:05.746
You need a ride home?

439
00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:08.456
[tense music]

440
00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:10.793
[Catherine] Didn’t
think police detectives

441
00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:12.253
were supposed to do this.

442
00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.253
[Detective Barr] What?
Drive someone home?

443
00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:16.841
See. the big idea is that you’re
supposed to warm up to me.

444
00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.008
It’s like we’re friends.

445
00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:19.718
So I’m more likely
to tell you things.

446
00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:20.799
Exactly.

447
00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:24.509
But I know you’re way too smart
for that. Ms. Brunner. so.

448
00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:26.016
All my cards are on the table.

449
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:28.016
You know. I was...

450
00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:30.018
I was thinking about
something that happened

451
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.647
my first day of work.

452
00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:32.807
Yeah?

453
00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:36.193
This really angry
woman was in the lobby.

454
00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:38.779
Her name is Jackie Reeves.

455
00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.197
She said that I took her job.

456
00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:43.197
She threatened me. told
me to watch my back.

457
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.786
So you think she might
have killed Julia Burke

458
00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.746
to set you up for revenge?

459
00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:49.831
Jackie was...

460
00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:51.832
She was really intense.

461
00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:53.878
Well. why didn’t she
just come after you?

462
00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:54.918
I don’t know. I don’t know.

463
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.547
I’m just saying
it’s a possibility.

464
00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:57.207
Okay.

465
00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:58.424
It is.

466
00:20:58.424 --> 00:20:59.934
We’ll look into it.

467
00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:03.637
Ooh...

468
00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:05.177
Nice ride. Yours?

469
00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:08.181
No. it’s a company car.

470
00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.021
Wow.

471
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.148
Well. it looks to me like he
had you set up real sweet.

472
00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:18.027
He had new toys. high
paying position at his fund.

473
00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:20.067
I believe they have a name
for that kind of arrangement.

474
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.820
Are we done here?

475
00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:23.822
Yeah. we’re done.

476
00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.786
But don’t leave town.

477
00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:29.446
We’ll be talking
again real soon.

478
00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:32.255
[dramatic music]

479
00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:38.839
Catherine. just calm down.

480
00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:41.089
I know there’s no way in
hell you could’ve done this.

481
00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:43.886
Paul. I don’t know
what happened.

482
00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:45.846
Okay. I blacked out.

483
00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:48.386
That’s never happened
to me before.

484
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.100
It was right after Pam took
me into the guest bedroom.

485
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:53.311
Well. she left. and then
I had to make my flight.

486
00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.397
You were all alone in the house
when we left for the airport.

487
00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:56.937
[Catherine] Well. someone
else was obviously there.

488
00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:58.981
Can’t we check the
security cameras?

489
00:21:58.984 --> 00:21:59.985
Well. that might be a problem.

490
00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:01.815
The cameras have
been down for weeks.

491
00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:03.906
Pam’s having the system
overhauled or something.

492
00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:06.196
They’re waiting on a part.

493
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.450
Oh. God.

494
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:08.951
Just don’t panic okay?

495
00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:10.913
I’m catching a red-eye
back to Atlanta.

496
00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:12.122
Catherine. I care about you.

497
00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:13.165
I don’t need any camera footage

498
00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.995
to know that you’re innocent.

499
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.460
Paul. I--

500
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.960
[Paul] Look. you don’t have to
say anything else. okay?

501
00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:20.047
I’m not gonna let you fall.

502
00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:21.377
I’m gonna get you
the best lawyer.

503
00:22:21.382 --> 00:22:24.382
I’m gonna fight for you.
and we’re gonna win. okay?

504
00:22:24.385 --> 00:22:26.055
-Okay.
-[Paul] Hang in there.

505
00:22:29.932 --> 00:22:32.476
[Catherine] I
can’t believe this.

506
00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:33.516
Oh. honey.

507
00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:41.318
I don’t know what to do.

508
00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:42.898
There’s a lot to unpack here.

509
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:46.823
Just be careful with your
feelings right now. okay?

510
00:22:46.824 --> 00:22:47.624
Stay calm.

511
00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:49.988
I mean...

512
00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:54.999
At least she didn’t
arrest me. right?

513
00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:59.169
The thing is. Mom. I had no
motive to kill that woman.

514
00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.919
I mean. if somebody is
trying to set me up.

515
00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:03.507
they’re not doing
a very good job.

516
00:23:03.507 --> 00:23:06.547
Everything’s gonna be okay.

517
00:23:06.552 --> 00:23:08.512
Oh. I love you so much.

518
00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:13.179
-[dramatic music]
-[Catherine sobs]

519
00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:18.397
It’s so terrible. the
police were just here.

520
00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:19.767
They talked to me
about everything.

521
00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:20.941
they made it sound
like you could’ve been

522
00:23:20.941 --> 00:23:22.526
planning Julia’s death.

523
00:23:22.526 --> 00:23:24.316
Well. I guess it’s
not surprising.

524
00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.570
They might try to prove it
like maybe I hired someone.

525
00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:28.115
so I spoke with Carpenter.

526
00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:30.365
he’s mobilizing an
offense team as we speak.

527
00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:32.367
Go over the details
with you later.

528
00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:34.909
I’m headed to Heathrow now to
catch the next flight back.

529
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:37.917
Paul. I’m so sorry you’re
going through all of this.

530
00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:39.417
Thanks for your support. Pam.

531
00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:41.545
There’s only a few things in
this world I can count on.

532
00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:43.415
and one of ’em is you.

533
00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:45.424
Of course. Paul.

534
00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:47.009
I’ll be right here.

535
00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:49.049
Thank you.

536
00:23:49.053 --> 00:23:51.813
[dramatic music]

537
00:23:57.811 --> 00:24:00.191
[tense music]

538
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.569
Well. aren’t you a
pretty little thing?

539
00:24:05.569 --> 00:24:07.609
Are you good in a fight?

540
00:24:08.656 --> 00:24:12.156
Getting along
famously with Paul?

541
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:14.659
You’re making a big mistake.

542
00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:22.965
Well. it looks to me like he
had you set up real sweet.

543
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:26.548
Catherine. I care about you.

544
00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:30.008

[phone rings]

546
00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:39.098
I told you not to call me.

547
00:24:39.103 --> 00:24:41.483
We can’t have any contact now.

548
00:24:43.023 --> 00:24:45.067
Look. I fixed the cameras.

549
00:24:45.067 --> 00:24:48.067
The police won’t find anything
I don’t want them to find.

550
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.406
But I don’t think
I can trust you.

551
00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:52.446
I’ve never been sure of that.

552
00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:54.868
So I want more money.

553
00:24:54.868 --> 00:24:57.078

554
00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:59.869
[Pam chuckles]

555
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.880
Oh my gosh.

556
00:25:08.716 --> 00:25:11.176
All these damn bags and lines.

557
00:25:15.097 --> 00:25:17.767

[Operator] 911.
what’s your emergency?

562
00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:28.001
No! Please. don’t.

563
00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:28.963
Please. no!

564
00:26:30.172 --> 00:26:31.298
I won’t say anything.

565
00:26:31.298 --> 00:26:32.088
Please. no!

566
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.131
[Pam screams]

567
00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:33.926
Please. no!

[Pam screams]

569
00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:39.971
Thank you. Mr. Burke.

570
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:40.933
We’ll be in touch.

571
00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:41.975
Lemme know what you find.

572
00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:42.805
Sure.

573
00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:50.859
Oh. just the lady
I wanted to see.

574
00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:51.985
[Catherine] What’s going on?

575
00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:53.645
Do I need to have
my lawyer present?

576
00:26:53.654 --> 00:26:56.490
Look. I only have one question
to ask you. Ms. Brunner.

577
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.780
Okay.

578
00:26:57.783 --> 00:27:01.203
Where were you last night
at exactly 12:26 AM?

579
00:27:01.203 --> 00:27:03.122
I was at home. asleep.

580
00:27:03.122 --> 00:27:05.332
Do you have a witness
that can corroborate that?

581
00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:07.000
Yes. my mother.

582
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.295
She was at home. She
was up late watching TV.

583
00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.335
Why? What is this about?

584
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:15.549
I’ll be in touch. Ms. Brunner.

585
00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:18.221
[ominous music]

586
00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:20.514
Catherine.

587
00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:21.348
What is going on?

588
00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:24.348
I am so glad you’re here.

589
00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:25.978
Where’s Pam?

590
00:27:25.978 --> 00:27:27.646
Why didn’t you call me
when you got in last night?

591
00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:29.686
My flight was delayed.
I didn’t wanna wake you.

592
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.358
Nonstop crazy around here.

593
00:27:31.358 --> 00:27:32.648
What’s going on?

594
00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:34.151
Something terrible
happened last night.

595
00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:36.697
-Oh. no.
-Come with me.

596
00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:39.697
[mysterious music]

597
00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:45.872
Paul. what is going on?

598
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:46.873
It’s bad.

599
00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:49.668
Can’t believe this is happening.

600
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:52.045
Pamela Prescott is dead.

601
00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:54.875
Someone broke into her home
and killed her last night.

602
00:27:54.882 --> 00:27:56.382
What?

603
00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:59.593
They have part of the murder
on a 911 call. apparently.

604
00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:02.222
That’s how they know
exactly when it happened.

605
00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:06.935
They wanted to know where
Paul was and where you were.

606
00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:09.095
Where were you?

607
00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:10.856
Well. I was in the
limo on the way home.

608
00:28:10.856 --> 00:28:13.186
The driver will testify to that.

609
00:28:13.192 --> 00:28:15.902
The police are also
speculating that Ms. Prescott

610
00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:18.030
might have discovered something

611
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.616
about the murder of Julia Burke.

612
00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:22.866
Catherine. this is
Andrew Carpenter.

613
00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:24.198
He’s the best
attorney in the city.

614
00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:25.621
He’ll be handpicking
our defense team

615
00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:28.248
if it goes the distance.

616
00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:29.958
They haven’t brought any
charges against you yet.

617
00:28:29.958 --> 00:28:33.128
but if they do. we’ll be ready.

618
00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:36.378
Wait. What about Jackie Reeves?

619
00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:38.926
She threatened me
directly. Paul.

620
00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:41.216
Why isn’t anyone
questioning her?

621
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.970
The detective told us
they were on their way

622
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:45.098
to interview Ms. Reeves.

623
00:28:45.098 --> 00:28:48.268
Meanwhile. I have some people
on their way here. now.

624
00:28:48.268 --> 00:28:49.768
We have a whole lot of questions

625
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.270
we need to ask
both you and Paul.

626
00:28:52.272 --> 00:28:55.108
Are you two ready for that?

627
00:28:55.108 --> 00:28:56.478
Yes.

628
00:28:56.485 --> 00:28:58.955
[tense music]

629
00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:02.115
[Detective Barr] So
you’re saying no one else

630
00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:03.235
was with you last night?

631
00:29:03.242 --> 00:29:05.077
I’m saying it hasn’t
been a good time.

632
00:29:05.077 --> 00:29:07.577
I just lost my job.

633
00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:08.997
So it’s just been you up late

634
00:29:08.997 --> 00:29:11.827
with the Johnny Walker Red. huh?

635
00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:13.627
I don’t appreciate
that. Detective.

636
00:29:13.627 --> 00:29:17.127
Well. I don’t appreciate
dead bodies. Ms. Reeves.

637
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.465
You had every reason to hate

638
00:29:18.465 --> 00:29:21.005
Paul Burke and
Catherine Brunner.

639
00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:22.509
I mean. he terminated
your employment

640
00:29:22.511 --> 00:29:24.346
and she took your job.

641
00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:26.346
So obviously I’m a murderer?

642
00:29:26.348 --> 00:29:28.475
Do you have any idea
how crazy that sounds?

643
00:29:28.475 --> 00:29:30.515
Oh. it wouldn’t be the
first crazy idea I had

644
00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:33.149
that turned out to be the truth.

645
00:29:35.148 --> 00:29:39.188
I think it’s time for
you to leave. Detective.

646
00:29:39.194 --> 00:29:41.321
For now. Ms. Reeves.

647
00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:42.161
For now.

648
00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:45.492

[ominous music]

651
00:29:54.668 --> 00:29:56.208
That was close.

652
00:30:00.048 --> 00:30:02.378
It was all so crazy. you know?

653
00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:06.388
He had this big time
lawyer in the room.

654
00:30:06.388 --> 00:30:07.638
He just kept asking me

655
00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:10.517
over and over and over
again what happened.

656
00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:13.387
He was coming up with
different narratives.

657
00:30:13.395 --> 00:30:15.731
questions to answer
in interviews.

658
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:18.150
Do you think it will help?

659
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.650
Mom. right now I can’t think
clearly about anything.

660
00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.202
This is all nuts.

661
00:30:23.196 --> 00:30:26.026
And Paul’s devastated.

662
00:30:26.033 --> 00:30:27.826
And what about him?

663
00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:29.866
Do you think you can trust Paul?

664
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:30.700
Yes.

665
00:30:32.164 --> 00:30:33.044
I think so?

666
00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:36.039
I mean. right now. I
don’t know what to think.

667
00:30:36.043 --> 00:30:37.043
I feel like...

668
00:30:38.045 --> 00:30:42.095
I feel like maybe we missed
something or someone.

669
00:30:43.425 --> 00:30:45.218
Hey. I thought I
heard you back here.

670
00:30:45.218 --> 00:30:47.218
Sorry to sneak up
on you like this.

671
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.556
I was on the front porch
just ringing the bell.

672
00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:52.726
Hey. Sol. Thanks
for coming over.

673
00:30:52.726 --> 00:30:56.346
I’m glad to see you.
It’s been a rough day.

674
00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:59.066
Hey. look. I know you’re tired
of talking about all this.

675
00:30:59.066 --> 00:31:02.235
but I just want you to know
that I’ve got your back.

676
00:31:02.235 --> 00:31:03.395
Oh. and I brought this.

677
00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:05.530
-[Catherine] Oh.
-What’s that?

678
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.199
Just some computer
stuff from work.

679
00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:09.239
Data miners and whatnot.

680
00:31:10.202 --> 00:31:11.787
Sure you don’t
need help using it?

681
00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:12.787
I mean. it’s no problem at all.

682
00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:14.748
I can show you how.

683
00:31:14.748 --> 00:31:17.248
This is my rabbit hole. okay?

684
00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:20.709
You’re a good friend.

685
00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:22.593

She’s the best there is.

688
00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:30.472
She’s tough. resilient.

689
00:31:30.472 --> 00:31:32.099
She was made for this business.

690
00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:34.099
She acts like
she’s a sweet girl.

691
00:31:34.101 --> 00:31:36.061
but all good girls
are secretly bad.

Bravo. Cathy.

701
00:31:51.451 --> 00:31:53.081
You fooled them all.

702
00:31:53.954 --> 00:31:56.124
You’re the belle of the ball.

703
00:31:57.416 --> 00:31:58.456

Oh. You must be the mom.

712
00:32:34.327 --> 00:32:36.157
You must be the detective.

Barr.

714
00:32:37.164 --> 00:32:37.998
May I come in?

Please.

You look like you
just saw a ghost.

719
00:32:49.843 --> 00:32:51.386
Bad dreams.

720
00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:53.676
Oh. well. they say
nightmares are a sure sign

721
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.348
of a guilty conscience.

722
00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:57.348
Is that what they say?

723
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.810
[Detective Barr] Do you mind
giving us a moment. please?

724
00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.188
I think I’m good
right here. Detective.

725
00:33:01.188 --> 00:33:02.188
Okay. fine.

726
00:33:02.189 --> 00:33:03.309
Have it your way.

727
00:33:03.315 --> 00:33:05.692
I’ll get right to the point.

728
00:33:05.692 --> 00:33:07.861
We found the weapon that was
used to kill Pam Prescott

729
00:33:07.861 --> 00:33:09.196
the other night.

730
00:33:09.196 --> 00:33:10.816
It turns out it was
at the crime scene.

731
00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:12.322
but that’s not the fun part.

732
00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:16.244
For the record. Detective.
none of this is fun.

733
00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:17.414
Duly noted.

734
00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:21.666
The blood test on the
weapon came in this morning.

735
00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:25.376
and of course Pam Prescott’s
was fully present.

736
00:33:25.378 --> 00:33:28.418
but we also found traces
of Ms. Burke’s blood.

737
00:33:28.423 --> 00:33:30.759
That means it’s the same weapon
that was used to kill Julia.

738
00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:33.049
Okay. and what does this
have to do with me though?

739
00:33:33.053 --> 00:33:35.222
Well. you didn’t let me finish.

740
00:33:35.222 --> 00:33:39.017
There were also traces of DNA
on the knife’s handle as well.

741
00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:40.227
They matched the swab sample

742
00:33:40.227 --> 00:33:42.057
you gave us the other
day. Ms. Brunner.

743
00:33:42.062 --> 00:33:44.356
Now what that means is
that we need to have

744
00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:46.396
an official chat with you.

745
00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:49.528
and I’m assuming you’ll wanna
have your lawyer present.

746
00:33:49.528 --> 00:33:51.238
Am I under arrest?

747
00:33:51.238 --> 00:33:52.778
No. not just yet.

748
00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.450
But I’ll see you this afternoon
at the precinct at 1:00 PM.

749
00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:58.119
Don’t be late.

750
00:33:58.119 --> 00:34:00.579
[tense music]

751
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:10.089
This is utter nonsense.

752
00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.926
Your theory is nothing
more than a sick fantasy.

753
00:34:12.926 --> 00:34:16.756
My client had no possible motive
for murdering those women.

754
00:34:16.763 --> 00:34:19.099
nor does she have any
history of violence.

755
00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:21.429
Yeah. but where I’m
still a little fuzzy

756
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:23.979
is the coincidence
that Ms. Brunner’s DNA

757
00:34:23.979 --> 00:34:27.107
is on the same weapon that
was used to kill both women.

758
00:34:27.107 --> 00:34:29.647
You and I both know Detective.

759
00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:32.611
my client was asleep
for a full six hours

760
00:34:32.612 --> 00:34:35.240
while Julia Burke
was being killed.

761
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.280
During that time.

762
00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:39.661
the security cameras in the
house were out of order.

763
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:41.997
A DNA sample could easily
have been taken from her

764
00:34:41.997 --> 00:34:44.287
while she was asleep.

765
00:34:44.291 --> 00:34:48.128
It’s clear to me that my
client has been set up.

766
00:34:48.128 --> 00:34:53.168
Jackie Reeves has no alibi for
the night of either murder.

767
00:34:53.466 --> 00:34:55.636
and she had clear motivation.

768
00:34:56.595 --> 00:34:59.431
Is that what you’re
gonna tell a jury?

769
00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:03.268
I promise. if you arrest
Catherine Brunner.

770
00:35:03.268 --> 00:35:07.478
an attempt to take it to trial
using the so-called evidence

771
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.440
that you presented
here this afternoon.

772
00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:13.320
we will win so big on acquittal
that it will embarrass

773
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.280
your entire police
department for years.

774
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:20.281
and savage your personal
reputation beyond repair.

775
00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:24.165
Now. that being said. I
believe it’s your move.

776
00:35:25.332 --> 00:35:27.712
[tense music]

777
00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:33.006
You’re free to go. Ms. Brunner.

778
00:35:33.006 --> 00:35:33.836
For now.

779
00:35:35.634 --> 00:35:36.843
Don’t say a word.

780
00:35:36.843 --> 00:35:38.386
We’re out of here.

781
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:41.136
[tense music]

782
00:35:49.481 --> 00:35:51.066
That was incredible.

783
00:35:51.066 --> 00:35:52.896
I thought I was a goner.

784
00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:54.401
You know. I’ve seen this before.

785
00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:56.029
The only reason she
did not arrest you

786
00:35:56.029 --> 00:35:58.698
was because she didn’t
want to Mirandize you.

787
00:35:58.698 --> 00:35:59.988
She’ll try to get you to slip up

788
00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:01.531
and say something
off the record.

789
00:36:01.534 --> 00:36:03.204
Don’t talk to her.

790
00:36:04.371 --> 00:36:06.498
Don’t talk to anyone.

791
00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:08.708
And I’ll see you and
Paul in my office

792
00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:10.418
first thing Monday morning.

793
00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:12.545
Well. is it true what you
said about the evidence?

794
00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:14.165
Will it stand up in court?

795
00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:16.007
I meant every word
I said in there.

796
00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:18.677
If they try this.
they will lose.

798
00:36:26.518 --> 00:36:27.768
Hey. Catherine.

799
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:30.061
Working from home today.

800
00:36:30.063 --> 00:36:33.523
I was hoping you would have
time to stop by the house.

801
00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:37.570
We’ve got a lot to talk
about. and I wanna see you.

802
00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.610
Okay?

803
00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:40.615
Bye.

805
00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:49.042
Hey. come in.

806
00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:55.916
Paul.

807
00:36:55.922 --> 00:36:57.882
Come here. Come here.

808
00:37:01.136 --> 00:37:03.296
Sorry. I just missed you.

809
00:37:04.139 --> 00:37:05.219
It’s okay.

810
00:37:06.558 --> 00:37:09.558
I’m just feeling really
overwhelmed right now and...

811
00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:10.601
Yeah.

812
00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:16.609
Pam and Julia didn’t
deserve any of this.

813
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:18.109
Can’t even make
funeral arrangements

814
00:37:18.111 --> 00:37:22.281
because of all the medical
examinations going on.

815
00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:27.579
I don’t even know how
you can stand to be here.

816
00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:29.789
where it all happened.

817
00:37:29.789 --> 00:37:32.289
I’m not the kind of guy to run
from things. you know that.

818
00:37:32.292 --> 00:37:34.085
I’m sorry. I didn’t. I mean-

819
00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:35.285
No. Catherine. it’s okay.

820
00:37:35.295 --> 00:37:38.423
I should be the one
apologizing to you.

821
00:37:38.423 --> 00:37:40.173
Just thought maybe
you. you know.

822
00:37:40.175 --> 00:37:42.469
being back in this
place might help

823
00:37:42.469 --> 00:37:44.429
jog your memory or something.

824
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:47.099
That’s when I asked you to come.

825

Well. the last
thing I remember....

We were toasting champagne.

828
00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:00.437
And then I...

829
00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:02.151
I’m awake.

830
00:38:03.865 --> 00:38:08.835
And I just. I remember
this feeling of panic.

831
00:38:10.663 --> 00:38:12.713
seeing her on the floor.

832
00:38:14.209 --> 00:38:16.789
Well. you got dizzy
after your last drink.

833
00:38:16.795 --> 00:38:19.672
and then Pam helped you
lie down in the guest room.

834
00:38:19.672 --> 00:38:21.172
You were completely
asleep by the time

my ride share came at midnight.

836
00:38:22.634 --> 00:38:24.844
and then what happened next?

837
00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:30.517
It all went down when you
were alone in the house.

838
00:38:30.517 --> 00:38:31.677
Is there anything
you can remember.

839
00:38:31.684 --> 00:38:34.729
can you just try and
think. that might help?

840
00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:36.147
No. no.

841
00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:37.147
-Nothing.
-Okay.

It’s okay. It’s okay.

Just take a breath. all right?

844
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.820
We’ll figure it
out some other way.

845
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.660
Would it be crazy if
I said I love you?

I’m scared.

I don’t know what I’m feeling.

850
00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:07.893
I know.

And I feel guilty for
making love to you.

just so messed up.

Well. it’s something
we both wanted.

Well. if Jackie
Reeves is responsible.

866
00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:11.242
the cops will nail her.

867
00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:14.702
She’s too hotheaded
to not make a mistake.

868
00:40:15.914 --> 00:40:18.917
But there might be
another possibility.

869

What are you thinking?

870
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.590
Well. Julia had a daughter
out of wedlock before we met.

and she hated Julia.

She attacked her once.

00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:33.348
We had to send her away to
a boarding school in Europe.

and she ran away.

where she is now?

clear she wanted nothing

out where she is now.

00:41:59.892 --> 00:42:04.856
and that his wife caught
the two of them together?

901
00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:06.606
I’m not saying
another word to you.

902
00:42:06.607 --> 00:42:07.977
You’re trying to trick me.

903
00:42:07.984 --> 00:42:09.986
I’ve had my cards out on
the table this whole time.

904
00:42:09.986 --> 00:42:11.896
and I’m not going away.

905
00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:15.699
So you just think about that.

906
00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:17.494
Real hard.

907
00:42:18.536 --> 00:42:21.706
[mysterious music]

908
00:42:28.921 --> 00:42:31.841
So. I got Jackie’s address
from that archives resource

909
00:42:31.841 --> 00:42:34.510
that Sol gave me access to.

910
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.805
It’s a powerful server that
basically takes a screenshot

911
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:40.265
of literally everything
on the internet.

912
00:42:40.266 --> 00:42:41.726
And look.

913
00:42:41.726 --> 00:42:43.436
I found this.

914
00:42:43.436 --> 00:42:46.186
Jackie Reeves was
Zoey Blackwell.

915
00:42:46.898 --> 00:42:48.898
It’s Julia Burke’s kid.

916
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.440
Paul’s stepdaughter.

917
00:42:51.694 --> 00:42:54.864
This came right off of
Jackie’s social media.

918
00:42:54.864 --> 00:42:57.784
She deleted it a
day and a half ago.

919
00:42:58.659 --> 00:42:59.869
Clearly she’s panicking. right?

920
00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:02.997
I mean. she’s trying
to erase her history.

921
00:43:02.997 --> 00:43:05.367
So. Zoey came back to America.

922
00:43:05.374 --> 00:43:07.794
and Jackie was friends with her?

923
00:43:07.794 --> 00:43:09.384
It’s interesting.

924
00:43:10.463 --> 00:43:12.923
Catherine. I know you
don’t wanna hear this.

925
00:43:12.924 --> 00:43:15.510
but I think we should turn
what you found over to the cops

926
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.260
and let them handle it.

927
00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:18.888
No. no. no. no. no.

928
00:43:18.888 --> 00:43:21.348
I wanna talk to Jackie first.

929
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:22.889
Just listen.

930
00:43:22.892 --> 00:43:24.182
I don’t think it
necessarily means anything

931
00:43:24.185 --> 00:43:27.063
that Jackie and Zoey
knew each other.

932
00:43:27.063 --> 00:43:29.148
But if Jackie’s goal
was to kill Julia

933
00:43:29.148 --> 00:43:30.608
and hang it on you.

934
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:31.978
well then you could be walking
right into the lion’s den.

935
00:43:31.984 --> 00:43:34.612
and I won’t have you
risking your life like that.

936
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:35.782
I hear you.

937
00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:38.908
I have to go to
my job interview.

938
00:43:38.908 --> 00:43:40.528
I’ll be back around five or six.

939
00:43:40.535 --> 00:43:41.494
Will you be okay?

940
00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:42.620
Yeah.

941
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.950
I’m worried for you.

942
00:43:43.955 --> 00:43:44.914
I’m okay.

943
00:43:44.914 --> 00:43:45.790
I love you.

944
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:46.749
[Hailey] I love you.

945
00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:47.999
Good luck.

946

[mysterious music]

947
00:43:52.338 --> 00:43:53.958
Yeah. well...

948
00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:58.928
I was seeing someone. and
Julia caught us together.

949
00:43:58.928 --> 00:44:01.055
She got the whole
incident on her phone.

950
00:44:01.055 --> 00:44:03.015
but couldn’t use it against me.

951
00:44:03.015 --> 00:44:04.305
Why was that?

952
00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:06.727
Well. she pulled a
gun on us that night.

953
00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:09.307
She was completely
outta control.

954
00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:11.149
We had already signed
the separation papers.

955
00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:13.399
so she didn’t have a
legal leg to stand on.

956
00:44:13.401 --> 00:44:16.861
Well. maybe she had another
plan and it just backfired.

957
00:44:16.863 --> 00:44:18.948
Paul. why didn’t
you tell me this?

958
00:44:18.948 --> 00:44:21.028
Well. I just. I don’t know.

959
00:44:21.033 --> 00:44:24.162
There was so much going on.
I didn’t think it mattered.

960
00:44:24.162 --> 00:44:25.580
It matters. okay?

961
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.120
Everything matters now.

962
00:44:28.124 --> 00:44:29.292
You know that cop?

963
00:44:29.292 --> 00:44:31.002
She told me that
they didn’t arrest me

964
00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:34.046
because she thought something
more complicated was going on.

965
00:44:34.046 --> 00:44:35.916
Those were her exact words.

966
00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:38.593
They haven’t ruled you
out as a suspect yet.

967
00:44:38.593 --> 00:44:40.011
Me?

968
00:44:40.011 --> 00:44:41.137
Come on. you don’t actually
believe that I could-

969
00:44:41.137 --> 00:44:43.757
No. I’m just telling
you what she said.

970
00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:49.226
Paul. I think we
moved too quickly.

971
00:44:49.228 --> 00:44:51.105
It’s no one’s fault.

972
00:44:51.105 --> 00:44:53.475
We both wanted what we wanted.

973
00:44:54.317 --> 00:44:55.977
I’m not saying that it’s over.

974
00:44:55.985 --> 00:45:00.665
I’m just saying that I need
time to process my feelings.

975
00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.367
Can you please just
give me that time?

976
00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:04.197
Yeah.

977
00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:05.826

stay here anymore.

out on the street?

You’re stalking me.

You still are. aren’t you?

Is that why you got
the job at Paul’s firm?

revenge plot?

1013

were embezzling funds.

put you up to it?

she do that. Ms. Reeves?

what you’re doing.

I want to help you. I
want to protect you.

1082
00:51:34.425 --> 00:51:36.927
but I can’t if you run from us.

1083
00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.596
Detective. I only
called you to tell you

1084
00:51:38.596 --> 00:51:40.386
that I am innocent.

1085
00:51:41.348 --> 00:51:43.475
I didn’t attack Jackie Reeves.

1086
00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:46.305
and I didn’t kill
those two others.

1087
00:51:46.312 --> 00:51:47.852
The next time you see me.

1088
00:51:47.855 --> 00:51:50.566
I am going to be able
to prove that to you.

1089
00:51:50.566 --> 00:51:52.226
Until then. I have
to stay off the grid.

1090
00:51:52.234 --> 00:51:56.280
so please. just tell my
mother that I love her.

1091
00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.406

Listen. if you get me
to where I need to go

1098

fast and quiet.

1099
00:52:32.441 --> 00:52:34.318
there’ll be a big cash

complete madness!

Yeah. I just said
the same thing.

1104
00:52:50.709 --> 00:52:52.628
We know she maxed
out her ATM card

1105
00:52:52.628 --> 00:52:54.878
at a drug store near the bar.

1106
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.257
and then she vanished.

1107
00:52:57.257 --> 00:53:00.427
Now. if you know where she
is. I suggest you come clean.

1108
00:53:00.427 --> 00:53:01.797
All I know is that my daughter

1109
00:53:01.804 --> 00:53:03.347
is out there alone and scared.

1110

accused of crimes
she did not commit.

1111
00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:07.810
Well. who do you think
did these crimes?

1112
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:09.436
I’d start with Julia’s daughter.

1113
00:53:09.436 --> 00:53:11.186
She hated her mother.

1114
00:53:12.314 --> 00:53:15.275
You know. Jackie Reeves
just told us all about her.

1115
00:53:15.275 --> 00:53:16.855
Yeah. she said Paul
Burke’s stepdaughter

1116
00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.110
has been living at her
place off and on now

1117

for a little under a year.

1118
00:53:21.073 --> 00:53:23.533
Of course. we have no idea
where she is now though.

1119
00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:24.952
but as it stands.

1120
00:53:24.952 --> 00:53:27.079
they’re both still
suspects even though

1121
00:53:27.079 --> 00:53:29.249
we have no real evidence.

1122
00:53:31.333 --> 00:53:33.043

waste any time.

1162

I completely understand.

1171
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:21.441
And you have every right
to feel the way you do.

this is all happening.

me that Catherine

wasn’t the only suspect.

into other possibilities.

Hello?

[Woman] Are we
going to play nice?

Who the hell is this?

1262
01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:29.561
[Woman] That’s need to know.
and you don’t need to know.

1263
01:01:29.561 --> 01:01:30.979
I’m not intimidated by you.

1265
01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:33.481
I’m very smart.

1266

I’ve covered the bases.

1267
01:01:35.066 --> 01:01:36.896
Julia had a daughter.

1268
01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:38.278
Is that you?

1269
01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:39.898
Are you seeking revenge?

1270
01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:41.907
[Woman] If you were
right about that.

1271
01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.987
do you think I would
really tell you?

1272
01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:47.579
All I want is your
daughter’s cooperation.

1273
01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:49.409
I need you to make that happen.

1274
01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:52.959
But honestly. I really don’t
care if you live or die.

1275

get that door open.

it won’t go well.

make any calls on the phone.

that we can trust him?

Why did you kill Julia? And Pam?

1400
01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:47.599
[Woman] I needed Pam to
make sure that the cameras

1401
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.269
in Paul’s house were down.

1402
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:54.019
She was easy to buy.
but she got greedy.

1403
01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.566
Where is my mother?

1404
01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:57.356
[Woman] Upstairs.

1405
01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.360

1406
01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:00.202
Move!

1407
01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:04.873

[Woman] She’ll be fine.

1411
01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:18.126
as long as you continue
to do exactly as I say.

1412
01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:19.631
Just let her go. okay?

1413
01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.592
I’ll do whatever you want.

1414
01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:23.219
[Woman] Whatever I want?

1415
01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.179

My name is Catherine Brunner.

1420
01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:13.979
and I killed Julia Burke.

1421
01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.356
She came to Paul’s
house that night.

1422
01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:20.606
she was angry and attacked me.

1423
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:25.448
I killed her in self-defense.
but I was scared.

1424
01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:29.288
so I lied to the police
about what really happened.

1425
01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:31.996
I mean. you don’t actually think

1426
01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:33.536
that anyone is gonna
believe this. do you?

1427
01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:36.125
Just say the words exactly
as they are written.

1428
01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:37.785
or your mom dies.

1429
01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:40.004
You can’t get away with this!

1430
01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:41.380
Yes. I can!

1431
01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:45.630
Now start the app again.
and say the damn words.

1432
01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:46.844
I said say it!

1433
01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:48.387
Okay. okay.

1434
01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:51.017
[tense music]

1435
01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:11.536
When Pam Prescott became
aware of the truth.

1436
01:12:13.538 --> 01:12:17.418
I had to eliminate her
to protect my secret.

1437
01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.745
[tense music]

1438
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:32.390
I’ve been on the
run from the police

1439
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:34.890
ever since I attacked Jackie.

1440
01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:38.521
I killed them all.

1441
01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:44.439
And I can no longer
live with my crimes.

1442
01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:46.363
This is my confession.

1443
01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.908
May God forgive me.

1444
01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:51.908
Very good.

1445
01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:57.748
No one is ever going to believe

1446
01:12:57.748 --> 01:13:00.708
that I did any of those things.

1447
01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:03.750
You’re no longer in
any position to argue.

1448
01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:07.133
In fact. you wanna
know a secret?

1449
01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:09.302
You never were.

1450
01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:12.597
Put it down now.

1451
01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:15.266
You sneaky bitch.

1452
01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:20.306
-[guns firing]
-[Catherine shrieks]

1453
01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:23.937
Are you okay?

1454
01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:25.276
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1455
01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:26.485
Are you okay?

1456
01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:27.485
Are you hurt?

1457
01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:32.115
We have to get my mom.

1458
01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.576
Come on.

1459
01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:36.286
[dramatic music]

1460
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.330
Mom! Are you okay?

1461
01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:43.085
Are you okay?

1462
01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.455
Yes. Yes. I think so.

1463
01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:46.962
Just sit tight. The
police will be here soon.

1464
01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:47.844
It’s over.

1465
01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:53.346
Paul. get me some scissors
so I can cut these.

1466
01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:54.136
Okay.

1467
01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:56.638
I’m gonna get you outta here.

1468
01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:58.809
I know you will. I
love you so much.

1469
01:13:58.809 --> 01:13:59.769
I love you too. Mom.

1470
01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:02.647
[Catherine and Hailey sobbing]

1471
01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:03.517
Okay.

1472
01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.482
We have an APB out on the woman.

1473
01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:09.278
but without a positive
ID. it’s gonna be tough.

1474
01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:12.156
You sure you never saw the
lady before. Mr. Burke?

1475
01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.696
Damn sure.

1476
01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:15.368
So does this mean
that Jackie Reeves

1477
01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.787
is no longer a suspect?

1478
01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.157
Maybe.

1479
01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:22.500
Unless she’s been working
with the kidnapper somehow.

1480
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.040
I’ll pick her and Zoey
Blackwell up for questioning.

1481
01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:26.837
If they had anything
to do with this.

1482
01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:28.377
I’ll get it out of them.

1483
01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:29.507
Thank you. Detective.

1484
01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:31.337
At least we know
you’re innocent.

1485
01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:33.636
The killer has no reason
to come after you again.

1486
01:14:33.636 --> 01:14:34.886
Yeah. maybe.

1487
01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:36.887
We’ll make sure you’re
protected for a few weeks.

1488
01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:38.557
just to be on the safe side.

1489
01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:39.976
Well. thank you. Detective.

1490
01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:41.226
Well. don’t thank me yet.

1491
01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:44.807
We still have a lot of
red tape to go through.

1492
01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:47.692
But I think we’ve
all earned some rest.

1493
01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:48.818
at least for a while.

1494
01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:50.488
Yeah. of course.

1495
01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:55.989
I’ll give you ladies
a minute. okay?

1496
01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.582
Thank you. Paul.

1497
01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:01.042
Hey. come here.

1498
01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:05.710
You okay?
Oh. my baby girl.

1499
01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:09.755
Oh. honey. I really thought
I was gonna die in there.

1500
01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:11.915
Well. you are safe now.

1501
01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:12.844
Okay?

1502
01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:16.220
And I love you so much.
I’m gonna take care of you.

1503
01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:17.930
Well. you better!

1504
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:20.766
You’re the adult in
this relationship now.

1505
01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:22.556
Come here.

1506
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.440
[calming music]

1507
01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:39.906
So. my mom accepted
the teaching position.

1508
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:42.410
She said that the classroom
is where she belongs.

1509
01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:43.873
That woman is awesome.

1510
01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.753
Damn right she is.

1511
01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:50.634
What’s wrong?

1512
01:15:53.632 --> 01:15:55.551
I mean. it’s been weeks.

1513
01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:57.591
Jackie and Zoey
had solid alibis.

1514
01:15:57.595 --> 01:16:00.306
and ran off to Europe as soon
as the cops cut ’em loose.

1515
01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:03.636
And that woman who kidnapped
your mom has just...

1516
01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:06.479
I mean. she just disappeared.

1517
01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:08.647
I mean. aren’t you concerned
that she’s out there somewhere?

1518
01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:10.477
Yeah.

1519
01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:13.653
Yeah. but we can’t
live in fear forever.

1520
01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:15.994
Yeah. I guess..

1521
01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.445
It’s just. there’s so many
question marks in the air.

1522
01:16:18.449 --> 01:16:20.949
But we got through it. right?

1523
01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:23.407
Found each other.

1524
01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:25.748
That means something. right?

1525
01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:26.788
Of course.

1526
01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:31.002
[wondrous music]

1527
01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:06.658
What do you think?

1528
01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:09.792
Wow. this place is amazing.

1529
01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:10.672
Like you.

1530
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:13.045
Come inside. I wanna
show you something.

1531
01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:14.125

Wow.

1537
01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.607
You know. I always wished
for a place like this

1538
01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:35.647
when I was a kid.

1539
01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:38.737
Somewhere I could escape
to. beautiful things.

1540
01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:41.407
and just nature all around.

1541
01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:42.237
It’s...

1542
01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:45.659
Well. your wish is my command.

1543
01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:46.745
If you look in the back.

1544
01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:48.955
beautiful green
grass. wonderful pool.

1545
01:17:48.956 --> 01:17:49.746
See that out there?

1546
01:17:49.748 --> 01:17:50.538
Yeah.

1547
01:17:56.797 --> 01:18:00.087
Catherine. will
you do me the honor

1548
01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:02.722
and allow me to be your husband.

1549
01:18:03.888 --> 01:18:06.765
You said if I killed
Julia. I’d be a rich woman.

1550
01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.305
You promised me $2 million.

1551
01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:09.559
Yeah. I know what I promised.

1552
01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.188
but you didn’t follow the plan.

1553
01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:14.558
Catherine was not supposed
to be in the crossfire.

1554
01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:15.774
and then when you
got Pam involved.

1555
01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:16.525
it got too complicated.

1556
01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:17.685
[Skye] I needed Pam!

1557
01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:18.736
Yeah. and she’s gonna
put us both in jail

1558
01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:20.446
if we don’t act fast.

1559
01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.777
Keep watching. guys.

1560
01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:26.160
Paul!

1561
01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.740
You poisonous snake!

1562
01:18:28.913 --> 01:18:31.583
You’ll miss the best part.

1563
01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:37.963
So if we play this smart.
we can get away with it.

1564
01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:41.926
What you need to do is
take care of Pam ASAP.

1565
01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:43.756
Then I can get Catherine.

1566
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:46.471
and you’ll get
what we agreed on.

1567
01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:51.936
You see. Catherine.
I didn’t trust Paul.

1568
01:18:51.936 --> 01:18:54.806
so I needed this
video as insurance.

1569
01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:58.859
I guess this is what they
mean by poetic justice.

1570
01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:00.069
I don’t know what this is.

1571
01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.609
She’s lying. She’s a liar.

1572
01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:02.821
I don’t know what that is.

1573
01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:04.821
Paul. you’re so pathetic.

1574
01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:06.242
I did everything for you.

1575
01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:09.286
and you threw me
under the bus for her.

1576
01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:13.456
So I had to hedge my bets by
kidnapping Catherine’s mom

1577
01:19:13.457 --> 01:19:15.537
to force the
confession out of her.

1578
01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:20.552
You ruined that. so now
all I want is my money.

1579
01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:24.126
Unfortunately. the
price just went up.

1580
01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:25.886
It’s 3 million now.

1581
01:19:25.886 --> 01:19:27.756
And if I don’t get it
wired to my account.

1582
01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:29.890
right now. tonight.

1583
01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:32.309
guess what goes
right to the cops?

1584
01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:34.639
I made a lot of copies of this.

1585
01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:36.272
You’ll get your money.

1586
01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.022
Leave Catherine out of it.

1587
01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:39.653
Hmm. how noble.

1588
01:19:40.567 --> 01:19:42.317
But don’t kid yourself. Paul.

1589
01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:44.399
By the time the police
figure all of this out.

1590
01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:46.949
I will be long gone.

1591
01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.239
and Catherine here
will always know

1592
01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:51.620
what a two-face slime you are.

1593
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.039
So I win. Paul.

1594
01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:55.207
I win.

1595
01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:56.077
No.

1596
01:19:58.043 --> 01:19:59.003
I win.

1597
01:19:59.003 --> 01:19:59.843
Freeze!

1598
01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:02.423
Drop that weapon.

1599
01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:03.263
Now!

1600
01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:06.468
I said now!

1601
01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:08.258
[gun clangs]

1602
01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:09.052
Get on the ground.

Hands behind your head.

1605
01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.270
Took you long enough.

1606
01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:21.022
Yeah. we had you covered.

1607
01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:22.860
You have the right
to remain silent.

1608
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:25.696
Anything you say can and
will be held against you.

1609
01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:26.486
All right. back off!

1610
01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.657
[Catherine gasps]

1611
01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:31.237
Calm down. Mr. Burke.

1612
01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:32.870
Give him some breathing room.

1613
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:34.955
Catherine. how did you know
Skye was gonna be here?

1614
01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:37.865
You remember that video
that Julia took of you two?

1615
01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:40.961
She sent that footage to
her lawyer before she died.

1616
01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:43.461
We saw it yesterday.

1617
01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:46.884
and it was unmistakably
Skye in that video.

1618
01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:47.760
[gun fires]

1619
01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.090
[both shrieking]

1620
01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:52.473
[dramatic music]

1621
01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:54.723
Damn it. Burke! Open this door!

1622
01:20:54.725 --> 01:20:57.395
[dramatic music]

1623
01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:09.656
Come with me. come with me!

1624
01:21:09.656 --> 01:21:14.696
-[dramatic music]
-[Catherine exhales]

1625
01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:38.727
[car beeps]

1626
01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:39.557
Freeze!

1627
01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:41.979
You got nowhere to go.

1628
01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:43.150
Drop it. Burke.

1629
01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:45.646
I said drop it!

1630
01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:50.284
Hands behind your head.

1631
01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:55.945
Turn around. face the car.

1632
01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:57.246
Turn around.

1633
01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:59.866
[tense music]

1634
01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:07.671
You have the right
to remain silent.

1635
01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:09.550
Anything you say can and
will be held against you

1636
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:10.800
in the court of law.

1637
01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:13.181
[siren blares]

1638
01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:19.935
[Catherine] So Jackie and
Zoey were never even involved.

1639
01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:22.895
It was just you and Skye
getting revenge on your ex-wife.

1640
01:22:22.896 --> 01:22:25.186
Julia knew all my secrets.

1641
01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:27.190
She was gonna destroy
everything I built.

1642
01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:29.111
just out of spite.

1643
01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:30.988
I couldn’t let her.

1644
01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:34.988
Yeah. so. it really was
all about money. huh?

1645
01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:37.369
I mean. after everything
that you said to me.

1646
01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:39.409
all your speeches
about integrity.

1647
01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:42.708
Catherine. what we had was real.

1648
01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:45.958
Just. I didn’t expect to
fall in love with you.

1649
01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.130
I could’ve been so happy.

1650
01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:50.966
You are a monster. Paul.

1651
01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:54.006
[melancholic music]

1652
01:22:59.683 --> 01:23:01.183
I’m so sorry.

1653
01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:04.275
[melancholic music]

1654
01:23:09.109 --> 01:23:11.028
[lighthearted music]

1655
01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:16.068
So. do you like your sausage
burnt or only slightly burnt?

1656
01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:18.865
I think I’ll stick
with these pancakes.

1657
01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:20.449
These look lovely.

1658
01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:23.081
Only the best for
the unemployed.

1659
01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:25.501
[Hailey] You’ll be back
on your feet in no time.

1660
01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:27.419
There’s lots of opportunities
out there for you.

1661
01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:28.249
Mhm.

1662
01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:32.922
And if I know the adult
in this relationship.

1663
01:23:32.925 --> 01:23:35.886
she’ll be running a Fortune
500 company in no time.

1664
01:23:35.886 --> 01:23:37.216
You know. after everything
we’ve been through.

1665
01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:40.057
looking for jobs isn’t
that scary. is it?

1666
01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:40.887
Mm-mm.

1667
01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:48.147
What is it. honey?

1668
01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:48.978
I just...

1669
01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:55.200
I just keep thinking about
all the lives he destroyed.

1670
01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:00.410
And even though I saw
his true face in the end.

1671
01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:05.165
I have no idea how much
of the kindness was real.

1672
01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.325
or if it was all just a lie.

1673
01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:11.421
Monsters have no true face.

1674
01:24:11.421 --> 01:24:14.131
They live in their
own deceit every day.

1675
01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:16.969
Mostly they deceive themselves.

1676
01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:20.055
That makes ’em so
much harder to see.

1677
01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:21.345
I mean. he looked
me right in the eye

1678
01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:23.767
and he told me
that he loved you.

1679
01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:27.937
And I believed him. because
he believed it himself.

1680
01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:31.941
But some of them do pay.

1681
01:24:31.942 --> 01:24:34.361
and he’ll be paying
a long. long time.

1682
01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:35.401
Hmph.

1683
01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:37.072
Yeah. he will.

1684
01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:40.992
In the meantime. we
have worlds to conquer.

1685
01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:42.828
[Catherine and Hailey chuckling]

1686
01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:44.198
Oh. honey.

1687
01:24:44.204 --> 01:24:47.374
Your father would
be so proud of you.

1688
01:24:47.374 --> 01:24:49.174
You’re a real hero.

1689
01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.796
Mom. you’re my hero.

1690
01:24:52.796 --> 01:24:54.086
Oh. I’ll take that.

1691
01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:55.007
[Catherine and Hailey chuckling]

1692
01:24:55.007 --> 01:24:56.627
Oh. well then here’s to us.

1693
01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:57.801
Oh.

1694
01:24:57.801 --> 01:24:58.927
Here’s to pancakes.

1695
01:24:58.927 --> 01:24:59.886
Oh. yeah.

1696
01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:02.756
[Catherine and Hailey chuckling]

1697
01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:05.394
[ominous music]
