a flat arm with our hand
rested under our elbow.

178
00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:37.248
and we're gonna go like this.

179
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:38.916
Christmas.

180
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.209
Christmas.

181
00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:43.045
A good way to remember this
is it's a whole day.

182
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.046
It's a whole day.

183
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.591
So here's the sun rising.

184
00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:47.717
Christmas morning.

185
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.887
And then it sets again.
and Christmas is over.

186
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.764
You're gonna be
having open hands.

187
00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:58.436
and then you're gonna be going
in that shape of the menorah.

188
00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:00.229
with those eight candles.

189
00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.564
Cold.

190
00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:02.940
Brr.

191
00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.066
If you're all cold.
what are you doing?

192
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.151
You're shivering.

193
00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:06.986
Brr.

194
00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.071
Oh. my gosh.
it's cold.

195
00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.866
In real life. you'd be showing
with your expressions.

196
00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:14.368
If it's really cold.
you're like...[gasping].

197
00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.871
You're sucking in your teeth.
Ooh!

198
00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:19.540
You're gonna show that
with your face. right?

199
00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.209
Or maybe
you're shaking even more.

200
00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:22.251
You're crouching down.

201
00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.545
"Ah. it's so cold!"

202
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:25.922
Right?

203
00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:29.842
The most important part
of Christmas

204
00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.011
or any other winter holiday.

205
00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:33.471
It's not about the presents.

206
00:08:33.554 --> 00:08:35.598
It's not about the stress.

207
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:37.308
It's not about the finals.

208
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:39.977
It's about family.
and we're gonna make sure

209
00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:43.272
that we're gonna be
spreading that love. right?

210
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.399
I know
that this year is very hard.

211
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.735
2020 has been kind of crazy.

212
00:08:47.818 --> 00:08:50.738
Right now. it might be
a very stressful time

213
00:08:50.821 --> 00:08:52.114
for a lot of you guys.

214
00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.115
but I want you to know.

215
00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.869
even if you can't see
your real-life family.

216
00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.080
you have a family here. okay?

217
00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:02.708
And I really want you guys
to take away from this lesson

218
00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.962
that we are a family here.

219
00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:08.089
Cheese!

220
00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:11.926
This one.

221
00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:14.845
So she loves french fries.

222
00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.931
Like always. she's eating them.

223
00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:18.182
Whenever we do video calls.

224
00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:21.727
she's always eating
french fries. like. constantly.

225
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.230
And she also loves Starbucks.

226
00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:26.274
and so.
she added the two of those.

227
00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:27.900
I think it's so funny
because. like.

228
00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:31.570
if I think of Nikki. I think
of french fries and Starbucks.

229
00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.614
[laughs]
Like. that's her.

230
00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:34.824
It's kind of hard to see.

231
00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:39.453
but this is actually a picture
of this person's panties.

232
00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:40.579
It's Dummy. and. like.

233
00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:43.499
there's just this old photo.

234
00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:46.460
and then taken a photo
of his skirt being lifted up.

235
00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.296
And they're like.
yeah. there you go.

236
00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.047
There's your locker.

237
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:51.674
It makes no sense.
and I love it.

238
00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.217
[giggles]

239
00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:56.304
<i>[bird chirping]</i>

240
00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:07.106
<i>So for me. personally.</i>

241
00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:09.025
<i>I have a few different stuff</i>
<i>going on.</i>

242
00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:12.320
<i>I have something that's called</i>
<i>auditory processing disorder.</i>

243
00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:14.113
and what that means is

244
00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:16.324
if there's
tons of sounds going on--

245
00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:18.034
like three people
talking at once.

246
00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:21.537
and there's music
or loud noises--

247
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.706
my brain just can't process it.

248
00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:27.710
and it ends up sounding
like a broken radio.

249
00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.587
You know.
sound comes in waves.

250
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.880
and it's supposed
to hit your eardrum.

251
00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:32.214
and it vibrates.

252
00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.342
but for me.
it just comes in.

253
00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.719
and my right eardrum
does not vibrate.

254
00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:41.057
So it creates sort of like an
echo chamber in my inner ear.

255
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.559
<i>and it could be</i>
<i>actually pretty painful.</i>

256
00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:49.023
So I am a teacher
for Helping Hands.

257
00:10:49.106 --> 00:10:52.068
Helping Hands is
a sign language community

258
00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.694
here in VRChat.

259
00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.364
<i>We have a lot</i>
<i>of deaf members.</i>

260
00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:58.574
<i>but it's not just</i>
<i>for deaf people.</i>

261
00:10:58.657 --> 00:11:02.536
<i>And it was established.</i>
<i>like. late 2018.</i>

262
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.915
Our goal is to
not only educate people

263
00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:09.085
about sign language
and the deaf community

264
00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.587
but also just
to create an environment

265
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.923
<i>where people can have fun.</i>
<i>make friends.</i>

266
00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:18.219
<i>And nowadays.</i>
<i>we have about 2.000 members.</i>

267
00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:22.139
<i>Each of our classes can hold</i>
<i>up to 60 people at times.</i>

268
00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:23.599
<i>which is an insane amount.</i>

269
00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:25.768
<i>We have a class</i>
<i>every single day of the week</i>

270
00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:29.313
<i>for five different</i>
<i>sign languages.</i>

271
00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.732
So this is one
of our other classroom worlds

272
00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.734
that we have here
in Helping Hands.

273
00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.070
We actually have
several different worlds

274
00:11:36.153 --> 00:11:37.863
for teaching ASL

275
00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.532
and all
of our other sign languages

276
00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:41.242
for their respective teachers.

277
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:44.662
And this world is primarily
used here by my friend Ray.

278
00:11:44.745 --> 00:11:47.248
Do you want
to introduce yourself?

279
00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:48.624
[interpreting]
Hello. everyone.

280
00:11:48.707 --> 00:11:50.126
How are you?

281
00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:52.670
I'm good.

282
00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:55.923
I'm very happy
to see you all again.

283
00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:01.470
So I am a fully deaf person.

284
00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:06.308
and I have been teaching here
for a very long time--

285
00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:08.310
since 2018.

286
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.938
And that's pretty much
about me.

287
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:12.982
I love helping out
everyone here

288
00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.483
and seeing them learn
and grow.

289
00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.485
That's all.

290
00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:18.946
[speaking as self]
<i>It was really hard for me</i>

291
00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:21.240
<i>to sign in VR</i>

292
00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:22.616
<i>because I've never</i>
<i>done it before.</i>

293
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.493
<i>and it was</i>
<i>a very big transition.</i>

294
00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:25.536
<i>But Ray.</i>

295
00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:28.664
<i>he was just so patient</i>
<i>and understanding.</i>

296
00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:30.791
<i>And he literally</i>
<i>just sat there with me</i>

297
00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.377
<i>and wrote words all over</i>

298
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.045
<i>and just sat there.</i>

299
00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:38.340
<i>And we signed together</i>
<i>each and every single word.</i>

300
00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:41.302
<i>just learning</i>
<i>how to adapt into VR.</i>

301
00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:44.555
<i>And it was</i>
<i>such a beautiful experience.</i>

302
00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:48.184
<i>just seeing his kindness</i>
<i>and patience.</i>

303
00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:51.395
<i>And. you know. I started</i>
<i>getting close to him.</i>

304
00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.315
<i>And then. he introduced me</i>
<i>to other members</i>

305
00:12:54.398 --> 00:12:56.650
<i>until it is where it is today.</i>

306
00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:59.862
And. like. Ray is still
a really big part of my life.

311
00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:30.476
you're gonna start
straightening this leg slowly

312
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.436
and bending this leg
at the same time

313

it was more of an escape.

When I first discovered VRChat.

713
00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:32.705
I was in a very dark place
in my life.

714
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:34.582
I'd just lost.

715
00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:39.254
like. someone who was
very. very important to me.

716
00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:41.965
So I saw VRChat.
and I was like.

717
00:30:42.048 --> 00:30:44.092
I can't be myself in real life.

718
00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:47.303
so I'll just be myself
in VRChat.

719
00:30:47.387 --> 00:30:50.098
which was very refreshing
to me

720
00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:52.892
that I can jump on.
and no one knew what...

721
00:30:52.976 --> 00:30:55.103
Like. when you lose someone
in real life.

722
00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:57.438
everyone's like.
"Oh. I'm sorry for your loss."

723
00:30:57.522 --> 00:31:02.026

to the death. basically.

724
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.779
In VRChat. no one knew
that my family died.

725
00:31:04.862 --> 00:31:07.282
or no one knew
that anything happened.

726
00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:12.704
So I just got to forget.
in a sense. that that happened.

727
00:31:12.787 --> 00:31:15.415
and then I have fun in VRChat.

728

where I had to go to hospital
about it.

737
00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:47.238

I was like. I can't do this.

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:24.383
is sometimes
what saves people's lives

1038
00:47:24.466 --> 00:47:28.303
or what gets them up out of bed
in the morning. you know?

1039
00:47:28.387 --> 00:47:29.596
- I won.
- No. you did not.

1040
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.099
- And I was like...
- Yeah.

1041
00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:34.059
- You're so weak.
- It's okay.

1042
00:47:34.142 --> 00:47:35.269
- I am not!

1043
00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:36.728

- Zap.

1048

Don't forget:
energy. expression. emotion.

1049

Exaggerate it.

1050

- [exclaims]

1051

"Oh. my God!"

1052

Really.
but commit to it. guys.

Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1065
00:48:20.314 --> 00:48:21.231
I'm Goblox.

1066
00:48:21.315 --> 00:48:23.775
I will be your host
for the evening.

1067
00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:25.611
- For professional chicken--

1068
00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:27.779
what the hell is it?

1069
00:48:27.863 --> 00:48:30.449
- Interpretative
chicken dancer.

1070
00:48:30.532 --> 00:48:32.951
- Interpretive chicken dancer.

1071
00:48:33.035 --> 00:48:34.286
I imagine that's going

1072
00:48:34.369 --> 00:48:37.664
to have a whole wide range
of requirement.

1073
00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.249
so I'm very much
looking forward

1074
00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:42.169
to seeing what it takes to be
an interpretive chicken dancer.

1075
00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:45.005
Zircron. take it away.

1076
00:48:45.088 --> 00:48:46.173
- Mm!

1077
00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:48.967
[tapping rhythmically]

1078

Bawk.

1079
00:48:50.802 --> 00:48:52.346
Now. I'm gonna give you
a dance sequence.

1080
00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:56.308
and I'm gonna let you tell me
what you think of it. okay?

1081
00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:02.356
[laughter]

1082
00:49:06.568 --> 00:49:09.571
- [grunting]

1083
00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:13.659
Thank you for having me.

1084
00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:15.243
[laughter]

1085
00:49:15.327 --> 00:49:18.205
<i>- Only two months</i>
<i>into our relationship.</i>

1086
00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:22.209
<i>Toaster came to fly out to me.</i>

1087
00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:25.379
<i>But of course. we knew when</i>
<i>he was gonna come visit me.</i>

1088
00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:30.133
<i>and we went</i>
<i>to a airport world...</i>

1089
00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:34.513
<i>And reenacted</i>

1090
00:49:34.596 --> 00:49:37.849
<i>what we think it might be like</i>
<i>to meet up in real life.</i>

1091
00:49:37.933 --> 00:49:40.560
<i>like. what we're gonna do</i>
<i>when we see each other.</i>

1092
00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:43.188
<i>We pretended that</i>
<i>he'd come out of the airport</i>

1093
00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:44.856
<i>and then I'm like over there</i>

1094
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.775
<i>like. you know.</i>
<i>like. super excited.</i>

1095
00:49:46.858 --> 00:49:49.361
<i>And then. we'd give</i>
<i>a big ol' hug and stuff.</i>

1096
00:49:50.904 --> 00:49:53.073
- The feeling I had
when I landed--

1097
00:49:53.156 --> 00:49:54.366
that last plane.

1098
00:49:54.449 --> 00:49:57.911
and it was dark.
and I was in her town--

1099
00:49:57.994 --> 00:49:59.371
<i>I was just like...</i>

1100
00:49:59.454 --> 00:50:01.123
<i>[breathing heavily]</i>

1101
00:50:01.206 --> 00:50:03.625
<i>I had to remember</i>
<i>to breathe. literally.</i>

1102
00:50:03.709 --> 00:50:05.043
<i>'cause I felt.</i>
<i>like. lightheaded.</i>

1103
00:50:05.127 --> 00:50:07.421
<i>I was so nervous.</i>

1104
00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:08.922
<i>And we're on the phone.</i>
<i>and I'm walking out.</i>

1105
00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:10.716
<i>and she's like. "Come here.</i>
<i>Come to this one."</i>

1106
00:50:10.799 --> 00:50:13.176
<i>you know. like 7B</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

1107
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.219
<i>So I start walking.</i>

1108
00:50:14.302 --> 00:50:15.887
<i>And then. she's like.</i>
<i>"Oh. God. I see you."</i>

1109
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:16.930
<i>and then hangs up.</i>

1110
00:50:17.013 --> 00:50:18.598
<i>And I'm like. oh. no!</i>

1111
00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:19.933
And then. I just hear...

1112
00:50:20.016 --> 00:50:21.435
[running footsteps]

1113
00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:23.311
[laughter]
In the parking lot.

1114
00:50:23.395 --> 00:50:25.397
And she tries to run
behind the pillar.

1115
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.234
but all I see is this goofball
running across the parking lot

1116
00:50:29.317 --> 00:50:31.737
in this beautiful red dress.

1117
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.947
and my heart sank

1118
00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:37.284
'cause I was like.
that's definitely her.

1119
00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:41.163
Nobody would be
as goofy as that.

1120
00:50:41.246 --> 00:50:43.248
- Wearing a red dress.
[laughs]

1121
00:50:43.331 --> 00:50:46.752
<i>- Wearing a red dress.</i>
<i>like. just beautiful</i>

1122
00:50:46.835 --> 00:50:50.630
<i>but just running behind</i>
<i>a pillar in the parking lot.</i>

1123
00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:53.425
<i>That was the only time.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1124
00:50:53.508 --> 00:50:57.512
- And I stayed there
for two weeks.

1125
00:50:57.596 --> 00:50:59.806
And then I had
to go back. sadly.

1126
00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.894
And with COVID. she's not
even allowed to come here.

1127
00:51:03.977 --> 00:51:05.896
Like. my country
will not let her in.

1128
00:51:05.979 --> 00:51:07.939
Nobody's allowed in.

1129
00:51:08.023 --> 00:51:09.858
We're the only ones
allowed out.

1130
00:51:09.941 --> 00:51:13.320
and even coming back is iffy.

1131
00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:15.155
so it's really tough right now.

1132
00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:18.575
So with
a long-distance relationship.

1133
00:51:18.658 --> 00:51:21.620
having VR is a gamechanger.

1134
00:51:21.703 --> 00:51:24.414
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>we'd be as close as we are.</i>

1135
00:51:24.498 --> 00:51:28.001
<i>and I don't think</i>
<i>we would have gotten as close.</i>

1136
00:51:28.084 --> 00:51:32.047
<i>I don't know if we'd even</i>
<i>have hit it off like we did</i>

1137
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:34.800
<i>because I would act</i>
<i>a different way.</i>

1138
00:51:34.883 --> 00:51:37.636
<i>She probably acts</i>
<i>a different way</i>

1139
00:51:37.719 --> 00:51:40.847
<i>to. like. someone new</i>
<i>that you meet. you know?</i>

1140
00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:45.352
Now that our feelings. you
know. are very. very surefire

1141
00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:47.312
and I know that I love her

1142
00:51:47.395 --> 00:51:51.191
and I know that I want to.
you know. keep being with her

1143
00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:54.486
and making this work
and eventually. you know.

1144
00:51:54.569 --> 00:51:58.114
not have to rely on VR one day.

1145
00:51:58.198 --> 00:52:00.659
100% in the future.

1146
00:52:00.742 --> 00:52:02.452
as soon as it's available.

1147
00:52:02.536 --> 00:52:05.580
I'm going to her.
she's coming to me.

1148
00:52:05.664 --> 00:52:08.875
I miss her more than anything.
- No way around it.

1149
00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:10.961
- Yeah. you know.
just after two weeks.

1150
00:52:11.044 --> 00:52:12.337
you know.
I know I belong with her.

1151
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:16.716
I need to have her in my life.

1152
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.260

00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:03.591
I have a feeling
you will like it.

1206
00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:06.886
And you're just
very appreciative.

1207
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:10.890
Anything I do.
anything I say.

1208
00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:12.851
you put it on a pedestal.

1209
00:55:12.934 --> 00:55:14.561
You're like.
"Thank you so much."

1210
00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:18.398
Like. honestly it means
the absolute world to me.

1211
00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:22.986
and I'm so happy that
I'm your go-to avatar creator.

1212
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:24.362
But--sorry.

1213
00:55:24.446 --> 00:55:26.364
- You're gonna make me cry
just for that.

1214
00:55:26.448 --> 00:55:30.076
[laughter]

1215
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.871
Oh. no.
- We're in for a treat today.

1216
00:55:32.954 --> 00:55:35.081
- I'm about to cry
just to that.

1217
00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:37.250
All right.
- All right.

1218
00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.085
- Hello?

1219
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:41.004
- You all good?
- I'm--I'm good.

1220
00:55:41.087 --> 00:55:42.422
I'm good.
- We're walking?

1221
00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:44.758
Yeah. we're walking.

1222
00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:47.010
Whoo!

1223
00:55:47.093 --> 00:55:48.511
[chuckles]

1224
00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:51.264
- I'm nervous.
I'm scared.

1225
00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:53.016
- You should be.
- All right. all right.

1226
00:55:53.099 --> 00:55:54.642
All right. we're gonna look.
- Yeah?

1227
00:55:54.726 --> 00:55:56.603
- In three. two...

1228
00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:58.271
- Come a little bit forward.
No. come here.

1229
00:55:58.354 --> 00:56:00.440
Forward a little bit.
Keep coming forward.

1230
00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:01.900
In the middle. in the middle.
- All right.

1231
00:56:01.983 --> 00:56:03.234
- There we go.
- All right.

1232
00:56:03.318 --> 00:56:04.486
- You ready?
- I'll look forward.

1233
00:56:04.569 --> 00:56:08.698
In one. two. three.
- Mm-hmm. mm-hmm.

1234
00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:10.533
- [gasps]

1235
00:56:10.617 --> 00:56:12.702
- Ooh.

1236
00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:15.705
[laughter]

1237
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:18.249
- [sobbing]

1238
00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:21.294
- I told you.
I told you.

1239
00:56:24.297 --> 00:56:25.840
- Give me a second.

1240
00:56:25.924 --> 00:56:28.676
- Like
you've never seen before.

1241
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.513
- Take it all in.
every feature.

1242
00:56:31.596 --> 00:56:33.973
- And you wanted
blue eyes.

1243
00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.975
I love blue eyes.
- Yeah. I changed it up.

1244
00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:37.769
I bumped into them.

1245
00:56:37.852 --> 00:56:40.814
- Head up. and then...

1246
00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:43.274
And then. spin.
- Yas. queen.

1247
00:56:43.358 --> 00:56:44.484
Spin it.

1248
00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:47.862
This is like a total.
like. new model for you.

1249
00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:50.448
- Yeah. this is like
completely different.

1250
00:56:50.532 --> 00:56:52.283
even the base. the head--

1251
00:56:52.367 --> 00:56:56.830
the only thing that stayed
the same was the horns.

1252
00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:59.249
- Yeah. which of course.
you're gotta get the tail.

1253
00:56:59.332 --> 00:57:01.126
but I didn't want to put it
on this model.

1254
00:57:01.209 --> 00:57:03.253
There was no way I was
gonna be able to work out

1255
00:57:03.336 --> 00:57:05.839
how to do a tail with a dress.

1256
00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:08.675
I was like. I have to leave it.
- Yeah.

1257
00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:12.178
- We tested her out
in the world as well.

1258
00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:16.724
She matches beautifully.
so you'll be perfect.

1259
00:57:16.808 --> 00:57:20.687
She's ready to go when you are.

1260
00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:25.525
- And then. in the middle.
is a hot dog.

1261
00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:28.194
- I have never tried
a croissant hot dog.

1262
00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:30.321
Oh. oh.

1263
00:57:30.405 --> 00:57:32.157
We're ready.
- We're going.

1264

1265
00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:38.246
<i>- Oh. I think it's supposed</i>
<i>to be. like. a blackboard.</i>

1266
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:40.331
so you can grab the ends
and stuff right there.

1267
00:57:40.415 --> 00:57:43.710
- I did this. ASL.
and then the assistive lessons.

1268
00:57:43.793 --> 00:57:45.920
- Okay. thank you.
Thank you.

1269
00:57:46.004 --> 00:57:47.922
I appreciate it. you guys.

1270
00:57:48.006 --> 00:57:50.258
[laughs]

1271
00:57:50.341 --> 00:57:55.305
I know it's. uh.
awkward and weird.

1272
00:57:55.388 --> 00:57:57.390
This is my first time
teaching here.

1273
00:57:57.473 --> 00:58:01.769
I'm trying my best
being a sub for Ray.

1274
00:58:01.853 --> 00:58:04.439
so bear with me. okay?

1275
00:58:06.232 --> 00:58:09.068
Next sign.
there's two signs for this.

1276
00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:10.653
You could either
sign it like this.

1277
00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:13.031
You point to your head--
point to your head--

1278
00:58:13.114 --> 00:58:15.200
and you pull the thought
out of your head

1279
00:58:15.283 --> 00:58:18.328
and you mix it all up.
'cause you're confused.

1280
00:58:18.411 --> 00:58:20.705
You pull that thought out
of your head. and you mix it.

1281
00:58:20.788 --> 00:58:21.706
You're all confused.

1282
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:24.709
You get all your thoughts
all jumbled.

1283
00:58:24.792 --> 00:58:26.377
Cry.

1284
00:58:26.461 --> 00:58:29.130
Cry. cry. cry. cry.

1285
00:58:29.214 --> 00:58:32.759
Show your tears.
or if you're really crying.

1286
00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:35.470
"Oh. I'm crying a lot."
Crying.

1287
00:58:35.553 --> 00:58:39.974
This is tons and tons of tears.
or just a little bit of tears.

1288
00:58:40.058 --> 00:58:41.643
Cry. cry. cry.

1289
00:58:41.726 --> 00:58:44.562
Cry. cry. cry.

1290
00:58:44.646 --> 00:58:46.314
Okay.
How do I pronounce your name?

1291
00:58:46.397 --> 00:58:47.732
TheThirdR?

1292
00:58:49.651 --> 00:58:50.568
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

1293
00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:53.613
- Hello.
- Hello!

1294
00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:57.033
- How do I sign "similar"?

1295
00:58:57.116 --> 00:58:59.410
- Mm.
Mm. that's a good question.

1296
00:58:59.494 --> 00:59:03.248
So same.
the sign for same is like this.

1297
00:59:03.331 --> 00:59:05.083
You have a "Y" hand.
You're showing same.

1298
00:59:05.166 --> 00:59:07.126
So you're connecting.

1299
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.628
But if you want to say
they're kind of--

1300
00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:10.630
you can say they're the same.
they're similar.

1301
00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:11.631
or you could use this.

1302
00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:14.634
This means "also."

1303
00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:16.302
Does that make sense?
Yeah. they're separate.

1304
00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:19.138
Separate. yeah.
- Thank you.

1305
00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.015
- You don't have
to go over all of them.

1306
00:59:21.099 --> 00:59:24.352
but like different signs
for. like. sexual orientation.

1307
00:59:24.435 --> 00:59:26.980
So. like. bisexual.
- Oh. like queer signs?

1308
00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:28.106
- Yeah. like queer signs.

1309
00:59:28.189 --> 00:59:30.984
Yeah. like. in your class.
or just. like--

1310
00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:33.278
- Yeah. I could do
a quick one real quick.

1311
00:59:33.361 --> 00:59:34.654
Sure. yeah.
- Thanks.

1312
00:59:34.737 --> 00:59:35.947
- We'll just go
through a few.

1313
00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:38.616
Yeah. well. one--one
that's good to know is "queer."

1314
00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.118
It's literally a rainbow.

1315
00:59:40.201 --> 00:59:42.245
Rainbow.

1316
00:59:42.328 --> 00:59:43.288
Rainbow.

1317
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:44.622
That's how you sign
rainbow or queer.

1318
00:59:44.706 --> 00:59:46.082
Queer.

1319
00:59:46.165 --> 00:59:50.003
And then one of my favorite
signs overall is this sign.

1320
00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:52.422
And this sign means trans.

1321
00:59:52.505 --> 00:59:54.299
And the reason why
I love it so much

1322
00:59:54.382 --> 00:59:58.219
is it means beautiful heart
and change of heart.

1323
00:59:58.303 --> 01:00:01.556
So instead of signing
beautiful--beautiful--

1324
01:00:01.639 --> 01:00:03.224
you're doing
that same hand movement.

1325
01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:04.559
but on your chest.

1326
01:00:04.642 --> 01:00:06.311
Yep. yep.

1327
01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:09.647
So your heart is pure
and beautiful. just like that.

1328
01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:11.357
And that means trans.

1329
01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:14.444
<i>[wind whooshing]</i>

1331

- [interpreting]
I really have no idea.

1332
01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:30.877
It's. like...

1333
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.881
it's kind of hard
for me to understand.

1334
01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:37.550
But I was just so focused
on my work.

1335
01:00:37.633 --> 01:00:39.844
focused on my students.

1336
01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:42.930
focused on my social life.

1337
01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:45.558
focused on everything else
in my life.

1338
01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:46.893
I got a phone call.

1339
01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:50.021
And you know. of course. me
being deaf. I couldn't hear.

1340
01:00:50.104 --> 01:00:53.358
But I was still able
to feel my phone vibrating.

1341
01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:56.402
I took off my VR headset.
and I saw that the call

1342
01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:58.529
was from my mother.

1343
01:00:58.613 --> 01:00:59.906
I was like. "Oh."
you know. "what's up?"

1344
01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:03.034
I really didn't know
what was going on.

1345
01:01:03.117 --> 01:01:07.080
When I answered the call.
I was able to see.

1346
01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:10.500
My mother explained that
my brother had passed away.

1347
01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:14.420
And I asked if he had passed
from coronavirus.

1348
01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:17.924
and she said no.

1349
01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:21.469
And see.
my brother has a problem.

1350
01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:23.554
He has a lot of depression.

1351
01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:27.934
And he struggled
for a long time in his life.

1352
01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:30.645
I asked what was wrong.
what had happened.

1353
01:01:30.728 --> 01:01:34.482
I was concerned
over everything.

1354
01:01:34.565 --> 01:01:39.779
There was one problem
in particular that...

1355
01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:42.115
He had--[sputters]

1356
01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:43.741
he had committed suicide.

1357
01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:46.911
And he had ended up
taking his own life.

1358
01:01:46.994 --> 01:01:49.914
And it was
a really big surprise for me.

1359
01:01:49.997 --> 01:01:52.917
I was really. really surprised.

1360
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.002
I-I couldn't express
my feelings.

1361
01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:56.129
I didn't know what happened.

1362
01:01:56.212 --> 01:02:00.007
And my mom also had no idea
what had happened.

1363
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:04.137
It was my first time
experiencing this.

1364
01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:10.768
I don't know what
to say. really.

1365
01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:17.275
I just felt helpless.

1366
01:02:17.358 --> 01:02:19.652
I realized that people
actually planned

1367
01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:25.950
to surprise me with flowers
in my Helping Hands community.

1368
01:02:26.033 --> 01:02:28.077
Uh...

1369
01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:30.455
they wanted
to support me

1370
01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:33.624
because of my loss
of my brother.

1371
01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:38.296
And they were very sincere
in telling me

1372
01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:41.674
that they really loved me.

1373
01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:47.054
And they understood the love

so much deeper in VR

The circumstance

it doesn't define
your relationship at all.

1725
01:27:14.228 --> 01:27:17.440
because you can't control that.

would see that

a lot of people

1739
01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:56.980
