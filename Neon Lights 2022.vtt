00:02:02.187 --> 00:02:04.198
>> What are you thinking about?

4
00:02:05.828 --> 00:02:07.630
>> The interview.

5
00:02:12.274 --> 00:02:13.834
>> What about it?

6
00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:18.245
>> I'm nervous.

7
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.171
>> What about it
makes you nervous?

8
00:02:21.206 --> 00:02:23.074
I won't be able to prove
that I can run Tempest

9
00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.647
and I'll lose my company.

10
00:02:24.682 --> 00:02:26.649
>> What do we do
when we're getting to that

11
00:02:26.684 --> 00:02:28.684
uncontrollable state?

12
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.297
Very good.

13
00:02:37.332 --> 00:02:40.091
What is the worst
that can happen?

14
00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:50.035
>> I've been calling you.

15
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.037
>> I didn't hear.

16
00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.284
>> I call you answer.

17
00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.046
That's how this works.

18
00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:02.454
>> I can handle this.

19
00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.214
>> Great.

20
00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.261
So we're not going to
fuck this up then are we?

21
00:03:08.462 --> 00:03:09.659
>> I have it under control.

22
00:03:09.694 --> 00:03:11.331
>> Hey. again. I

23
00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:14.158
just wanted to pop in and say
hi before we get started.

24
00:03:17.937 --> 00:03:19.438
Okay. all righty. um.

25
00:03:19.473 --> 00:03:22.067
looking forward to it
and see you out there.

26
00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:27.743
>> She's going to be trouble.

27
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.884
Tense is never good.

28
00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.326
Never good.

29
00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:43.528
Smile. Act natural.

30
00:03:43.563 --> 00:03:46.190
Don't bring up the offer price.
and if she brings it up.

31
00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:47.928
just tell her
it's still being finalized.

32
00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:51.261
You can talk about India.
just no specifics.

33
00:03:51.296 --> 00:03:54.902
Clayton. don't fuck this up.

34
00:03:54.937 --> 00:03:56.937
They're watching.

35
00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:01.040
You know. you're my favorite.

36
00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:04.978
You know that.
always and forever.

37
00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:11.556
>> Good morning. everyone.
and welcome to Tech Weekly.

38
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:13.525
I'm your host Anna Reid.

39
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.725
Here with us today
is Clay Amani.

40
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.223
the brilliant mind and
visionary behind Tempest Tech.

41
00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.060
Thanks for
coming in today. Clay.

42
00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:27.165
So Tempest has had the fastest
growth in the last 18 months.

43
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.266
You must be proud?

44
00:04:29.972 --> 00:04:31.741
>> Yes. it's very exciting.

45
00:04:31.776 --> 00:04:33.380
We work very hard and

46
00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:35.943
we're very close to
achieving our goals.

47
00:04:35.978 --> 00:04:39.386
>> There seems to be a trend
with young tech entrepreneurs of

48
00:04:39.421 --> 00:04:41.586
promising the Moon and
pushing for aggressive growth

49
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:45.183
in a short span
with minimal to show for it.

50
00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:47.823
Is that the case with Tempest?

51
00:04:47.858 --> 00:04:51.156
>> We've been able to manage
our growth conservatively.

52
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.993
Yet effectively.

53
00:04:53.864 --> 00:04:55.666
>> What sets you apart?

54
00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:02.442
>> Well. our expansions
have been more timely.

55
00:05:02.477 --> 00:05:06.776
and we've been able to manage
our hires and our facilities

56
00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:09.416
to meet our requirements
and product output rather...

57
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:12.177
>> Rather than showcase
nominal value.

58
00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:20.185
>> No. no. no.

59
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.791
Not nominal.

60
00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:25.795
actual value with correct
figures to back the growth.

61
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.830
>> Speaking of growth.

62
00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:29.997
there has been a ton of
speculation surrounding

63
00:05:30.032 --> 00:05:32.472
Tempest's expansion
and specifically.

64
00:05:32.507 --> 00:05:36.839
what are your strategic plans
for expanding into India?

65
00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:39.369
>> We feel our
expansion into India

66
00:05:39.404 --> 00:05:42.372
will provide opportunities
for us to grow

67
00:05:42.407 --> 00:05:44.484
while still allowing Tempest

68
00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:46.816
to bring better health care
systems to parts of the world

69
00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:49.016
that. obviously need it.

70
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:53.053
>> Well. obviously it's also
a cost effective investment.

71
00:05:53.088 --> 00:05:55.121
Now would you say.
the lower offer price

72
00:05:55.156 --> 00:05:57.431
is a way to entice investors to

73
00:05:57.466 --> 00:05:59.466
overlook a depressed
last quarter.

74
00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:06.132
>> No. no. no.
not depressed.

75
00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:08.167
not depressed at all.

76
00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:11.401
Prices would decrease to garner
attention from investors

77
00:06:11.436 --> 00:06:14.712
willing to take a bet on
Tempest. long term.

78
00:06:14.747 --> 00:06:16.714
We're excited
about our technologies.

79
00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:19.519
product and growth.

80
00:06:19.554 --> 00:06:23.886
>> Prices weren't increased.
though. correct?

81
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.497
How about this. sources. say

82
00:06:30.532 --> 00:06:35.095
that. Tempest's management is
undergoing massive change.

83
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:39.330
specifically that your board
is looking to replace

84
00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.706
you as acting CEO.

85
00:06:42.544 --> 00:06:44.544
Is there any truth to that?

86
00:06:49.947 --> 00:06:52.211
We can skip to the next
question. if you'd like.

87
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:56.281
Okay.

88
00:06:56.316 --> 00:06:57.557
Let's go back to...

89
00:06:57.592 --> 00:07:00.087
>> No more questions.

90
00:07:00.122 --> 00:07:01.924
Shut that off.

91
00:07:12.937 --> 00:07:14.508
>> Are you okay?

92
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.973
Was I too much?

93
00:07:18.008 --> 00:07:20.580
I'm just. it's my job.

94
00:07:22.177 --> 00:07:23.583
>> You're trying to ruin me.

95
00:07:23.618 --> 00:07:25.376
>> I'm not trying to
do anything.

96
00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:28.313
>> You're trying to
make me look inept.

97
00:07:28.348 --> 00:07:31.558
You. succeeded.

98
00:07:31.593 --> 00:07:33.021
>> Clay.

99
00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.156
May I?

100
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:38.565
You're talented.

101
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.161
Everyone recognizes that.

102
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.572
That brain of yours
is. incredible.

103
00:07:45.607 --> 00:07:47.739
It's extraordinary.

104
00:07:47.774 --> 00:07:53.613
Building software
and technology.

105
00:07:53.648 --> 00:07:56.374
What you went through
was tragic.

106
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.589
But eventually. you'll set
yourself free otherwise.

107
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.421
Good luck
with everything. Clay.

108
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:28.846
>> Oh you sure handled that.

109
00:08:30.817 --> 00:08:35.248
That was the one time
you had to do it alone. Clayton.

110
00:08:35.617 --> 00:08:38.383
That was the one time

111
00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:41.386
that you needed to prove

112
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:43.190
that you could
handle the stresses

113
00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:47.227
that come with being
a CEO of your own company.

114
00:08:48.063 --> 00:08:49.669
That you can handle
the tough questions.

115
00:08:49.704 --> 00:08:54.234
the scrutiny. that you could
handle your destiny

116
00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:57.270
and you failed.

117
00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:58.909
You failed.

118
00:09:00.682 --> 00:09:03.573
You'll always need me.

119
00:09:03.608 --> 00:09:07.445
>> No. I don't.

120
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:12.824
>> Round and round
and round. you go.

121
00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:16.025
into the shadows.
Clayton must go.

122
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.667
Round and round
and round you go.

123
00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:26.266
>> I can't do it.

124
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:28.939
>> You don't need that
here. Clay.

125
00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:36.716
Thank you.

126
00:09:37.884 --> 00:09:40.280
What can't you do?

127
00:09:40.315 --> 00:09:42.315
>> Run. Tempest.

128
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:47.617
I can't run Tempest.
>> Just stay with me
just for a moment. Clay.

129
00:09:52.393 --> 00:09:55.394
Clay. Sit down. please.

130
00:09:56.936 --> 00:09:59.167
Please Clay. sit down.

131
00:10:02.106 --> 00:10:03.567
Thank you.

132
00:10:04.306 --> 00:10:05.503
Now.

133
00:10:06.748 --> 00:10:08.638
Do you need to
run Tempest to be happy

134
00:10:08.673 --> 00:10:12.543
with what you've created?

135
00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:15.282
>> Tempest is all I have left.

136
00:10:15.317 --> 00:10:17.515
It's all that's been
keeping me going.

137
00:10:19.794 --> 00:10:24.390
>> Are you having
dark thoughts. Clay?

138
00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:25.490
>> No.

139
00:10:28.935 --> 00:10:32.398
>> We can't move forward and
deal with our present issues

140
00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:35.137
until we deal with our past.

141
00:10:35.172 --> 00:10:38.668
I think it's time
we deal with the traumas

142
00:10:38.703 --> 00:10:41.781
we talked about what
needed to happen eventually.

143
00:10:41.816 --> 00:10:43.541
And now it's time.

144
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.613
It is time you
reconnect with them.

145
00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:58.391
You must and you will.

146
00:11:05.807 --> 00:11:08.566
Okay. Okay. Okay.

147
00:11:13.012 --> 00:11:17.245
Good. Now just
close your eyes.

148
00:11:18.853 --> 00:11:21.183
Allow yourself to relax.

149
00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:42.666
>> Clay Amani of Tempest Tech

150
00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:45.812
has gone off the grid
with little explanation.

151
00:11:45.847 --> 00:11:47.077
And so close to IPO.

152
00:11:47.112 --> 00:11:49.739
the company stands
on the verge of collapsing.

153
00:11:49.774 --> 00:11:51.741
His ability to operate and lead

154
00:11:51.776 --> 00:11:54.678
has come into question
for quite some time now.

155
00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:56.581
How will Tempest recover?

156
00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:58.825
Who will replace
the once revolutionary

157
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.794
health care tech genius?

158
00:12:02.864 --> 00:12:06.591
>> Hello Anna. it's been
a really long time.

159
00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:08.868
and I just thought.
I would call.

160
00:12:08.903 --> 00:12:13.873
because. because I thought maybe

161
00:12:13.908 --> 00:12:17.701
I could take the family
back to India.

162
00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:32.892
>> Well. well. if it ain't
the tech genius himself.

163
00:12:32.927 --> 00:12:35.620
>> James. James.

164
00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:36.830
>> We see you got
your stut. stutter

165
00:12:36.865 --> 00:12:39.866
when you're nervous. huh.

166
00:12:39.901 --> 00:12:42.528
Still like physical
contact too right.

167
00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:45.432
Damn. you did good bro.
>> Yeah.

168
00:12:45.467 --> 00:12:47.467
>> You did real good.

169
00:12:48.303 --> 00:12:51.636
>> Hi. thanks for
having us. Clay.

170
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:53.473
This place is beautiful.

171
00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:58.247
Blair baby. come say hi
to your. uncle.

172
00:12:58.282 --> 00:13:02.284
>> Hi. It's uh. nice to
see you again.

173
00:13:03.485 --> 00:13:06.860
>> Again. when did you see him?

174
00:13:06.895 --> 00:13:10.655
>> Oh. honey. he's a famous
tech guy on TV.

175
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.096
>> Yeah.

176
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:14.934
>> Oh. right. right.

177
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.938
All right. well.
this is all. peachy.

178
00:13:18.973 --> 00:13:21.138
Can we go inside?

179
00:13:21.173 --> 00:13:22.700
>> Yes. yes.

180
00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:24.878
Why don't I show you to
rooms and get you settled?

181
00:13:24.913 --> 00:13:26.704
>> Um-hmm!

182
00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:28.948
James. come and grab
our shit.

183
00:13:28.983 --> 00:13:30.477
>> No. no. no. that's okay.

184
00:13:30.512 --> 00:13:32.776
The housekeepers will be
able to bring you bags

185
00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:33.843
up to your rooms for you.

186
00:13:33.878 --> 00:13:35.086
>> Housekeepers.

187
00:13:35.121 --> 00:13:37.924
That's uh. that's what I wanted.

188
00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:39.288
I like that. I like that a lot.

189
00:13:39.323 --> 00:13:41.521
You got uh. you got to
have a few of those.

190
00:13:41.556 --> 00:13:44.359
>> James. you're so annoying.
let's go Blair.

191
00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:47.791
>> You good?

192
00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:15.159
>> This. this is
the living room?

193
00:14:15.194 --> 00:14:16.721
>> Yeah. no shit.

194
00:14:16.756 --> 00:14:19.526
>> This place looks old.

195
00:14:19.561 --> 00:14:22.100
>> It is. it was built
in the 20s.

196
00:14:22.135 --> 00:14:23.937
>> Furniture's from the 20s too?

197
00:14:23.972 --> 00:14:26.731
>> Some. yes.

198
00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:28.370
>> Antiques.

199
00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:30.735
>> That's right.

200
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.803
>> Yeah. you got any booze?

201
00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:34.838
>> Yes.
>> Really. So soon.

202
00:14:38.019 --> 00:14:42.747
>> Here's the bar. it's full.
so please help yourself.

203
00:14:42.782 --> 00:14:45.816
>> Antique bar to go with
antique furniture

204
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:50.623
and an antique house.
it's amazing.

205
00:14:55.696 --> 00:14:57.465
>> No don't.

206
00:14:59.403 --> 00:15:01.832
There's a bottle opener
in the drawer James?

207
00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:04.406
>> There's no need bro.
I'm simple.

208
00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.376
>> Whoops!
>> No. no. no.

209
00:15:07.411 --> 00:15:09.048
>> Guys.

210
00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:12.843
>> Please be careful
because this rug...

211
00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:15.582
>> It's antique.

212
00:15:15.617 --> 00:15:16.814
>> Yes.

213
00:15:18.455 --> 00:15:20.158
That's the kitchen.

214
00:15:20.193 --> 00:15:22.226
>> Let me guess.
let me guess. umm.

215
00:15:22.261 --> 00:15:24.393
personal chef.

216
00:15:24.428 --> 00:15:28.793
>> No. but there's lots of food

217
00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:31.400
and you can help yourself.
>> Thank you.

218
00:15:31.435 --> 00:15:33.963
>> You have housekeepers.
but no chef.

219
00:15:33.998 --> 00:15:37.274
Okay. I got to teach you how to
run a mother fuckin mansion.
>> James. Shut up man.

220
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:38.869
>> What?

221
00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:40.640
We're bonding.

222
00:15:40.675 --> 00:15:41.806
>> Uh.

223
00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:43.841
I'll. I'll show you
to your rooms.

224
00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:02.893
This is your room.

225
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.075
>> Check out the lighting.

226
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.308
It's just like the club. huh.

227
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.907
>> This one's yours. James.

228
00:16:19.483 --> 00:16:22.715
>> Money for the money. man.

229
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.321
Well I dig it.

230
00:16:24.356 --> 00:16:25.454
>> Hmm.

231
00:16:25.489 --> 00:16:27.126
>> Yeah. we'll work on that.

232
00:16:27.161 --> 00:16:28.523
Yeah. when did
the housekeepers bring this up?

233
00:16:28.558 --> 00:16:31.460
I didn't see no one.

234
00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:33.264
Stealth employees. I like it.

235
00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:35.464
>> No. no. no. no.
no shoes on the bed.

236
00:16:35.499 --> 00:16:39.105
Take them off bro.
>> Just chill.

237
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:44.539
Oh. this feels good.

238
00:16:44.574 --> 00:16:49.874
>> This one's yours.

239
00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:51.876
>> Wow.

240
00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:52.910
Oh. this is beautiful.

241
00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:56.683
>> This isn't yours.

242
00:16:56.718 --> 00:16:59.686
>> Don't worry kid. won't make
too much noise. all right.

243
00:16:59.721 --> 00:17:01.721
>> No. please.

244
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:03.987
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

245
00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:09.168
My house. my rules.
everybody gets their own rooms.

246
00:17:09.203 --> 00:17:13.997
>> Hey. that's. that's cool.
that's cool. right?

247
00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:15.339
>> Yeah. sure.

248
00:17:30.224 --> 00:17:32.587
>> Dinner will be at- 00 p.m..

249
00:17:32.622 --> 00:17:34.556
Please don't be late.

250
00:17:34.591 --> 00:17:36.954
>> What's upstairs?

251
00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.362
>> It's off limits.

252
00:17:38.397 --> 00:17:40.958
>> What else
is off limits. hotshot?

253
00:17:42.962 --> 00:17:44.368
>> Housekeepers
live on the estate

254
00:17:44.403 --> 00:17:47.404
and they prefer their privacy.

255
00:17:52.444 --> 00:17:55.214
Okay. We'll see you at dinner.

256
00:17:55.249 --> 00:17:57.040
Please don't be late.

257
00:18:02.652 --> 00:18:04.982
- 00 p.m.

258
00:18:10.429 --> 00:18:11.956
>> Why?

259
00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:20.602
My house. my rules. Benny.

260
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.218
>> How joyful.

261
00:18:32.253 --> 00:18:34.649
Family reunions Clayton.

262
00:18:34.684 --> 00:18:37.685
are always just joyful.

263
00:18:39.183 --> 00:18:42.690
Clarissa's still very easy to
look at. isn't she?

264
00:18:45.629 --> 00:18:49.092
We're still fond of your
brother's wife. aren't we?

265
00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:55.164
Nothing like a little
incestuous reunion.

266
00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:57.441
Just spice things up.

267
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.413
I want it noted
that I don't think

268
00:19:02.448 --> 00:19:06.010
this is going to pan out
exactly the way you think

269
00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:08.045
it's going to happen.

270
00:19:09.653 --> 00:19:11.147
>> Noted.

271
00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:17.186
>> Very well then sire.

272
00:19:17.221 --> 00:19:19.463
you're in control now.

273
00:20:00.341 --> 00:20:01.274
>> Hello.

274
00:20:04.268 --> 00:20:07.478
Sorry. hope
I didn't scare you.

275
00:20:07.513 --> 00:20:09.513
What have you got there?

276
00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:13.319
Oh. it's a magpie.

277
00:20:13.354 --> 00:20:16.080
One means sorrow.

278
00:20:16.115 --> 00:20:18.324
It's a superstition.

279
00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:21.327
May. may I?

280
00:20:21.362 --> 00:20:26.123
Here little guy. here little guy
it's okay. it's okay. it's okay.

281
00:20:30.734 --> 00:20:32.734
You need to set him free.

282
00:20:57.596 --> 00:21:01.290
♪ You made me
you trust me ♪

283
00:21:01.325 --> 00:21:05.195
♪ It's all over the country ♪

284
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.133

285
00:21:09.168 --> 00:21:11.377

286
00:21:17.418 --> 00:21:19.418
>> You're the fuckin wolf.

287
00:21:19.453 --> 00:21:21.145
Yeah that's right baby

288
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.181
you're the motherfucking wolf.

289
00:21:25.426 --> 00:21:27.393
You're going to
get what's yours.

290
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.363
Tonight.

291
00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:32.827
So are you.

292
00:21:50.484 --> 00:21:52.484
>> What are you doing?

293
00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.624
>> We're going to take a shower.
but it's taken.

294
00:22:02.463 --> 00:22:03.858
>> Dinner's almost ready. James.

295
00:22:03.893 --> 00:22:05.893
>> Yeah. I'll be right there.

296
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:22.613
>> I think I got a business
proposition for you.

297
00:22:22.648 --> 00:22:26.881
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. I think it's time
that you diversify a bit.

298
00:22:26.916 --> 00:22:29.213
Maybe we become partners.

299
00:22:30.722 --> 00:22:32.458
>> In what?

300
00:22:32.493 --> 00:22:34.625
>> The club. obviously.

301
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.858
>> Oh obviously.

302
00:22:36.893 --> 00:22:39.025
>> Look. man. I'm serious.
I'm looking to expand.

303
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.466
and I know you do
a little bit of this

304
00:22:40.501 --> 00:22:41.665
and a little bit of that.

305
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.295
>> Wow. Clay. this looks
absolutely amazing.

306
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.505
Oh.

307
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.474
>> Who made all this?

308
00:22:48.509 --> 00:22:50.476
>> My chef.

309
00:22:50.511 --> 00:22:52.137
>> I thought you said
you didn't actually.

310
00:22:52.172 --> 00:22:54.513
actually let me guess. umm.

311
00:22:54.548 --> 00:22:58.044
You hired one
because I'm a genius.

312
00:22:58.079 --> 00:23:00.079
See. we make great partners.

313
00:23:00.114 --> 00:23:01.718
James. I honestly think
you get dumber

314
00:23:01.753 --> 00:23:03.049
by the minute. dude.

315
00:23:03.084 --> 00:23:06.250
>> Mm-Hmm. Mm-Hmm.

316
00:23:06.285 --> 00:23:08.527
>> So we good.
>> Mm-Hmm. Yes.

317
00:23:08.562 --> 00:23:10.661
>> I'm starved.
Lets have a leg.

318
00:23:10.696 --> 00:23:13.664
>> Wait. wait. could
you start with the salad.

319
00:23:13.699 --> 00:23:14.929
Salad first.

320
00:23:14.964 --> 00:23:18.504
>> Okay. Yeah. okay..

321
00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:19.901
>> Yeah. I don't eat salad.

322
00:23:19.936 --> 00:23:21.540
>> You can use
some veggies. bro.

323
00:23:21.575 --> 00:23:23.267
>> What does that
even mean. man?

324
00:23:23.302 --> 00:23:25.907
>> Just please
shut up. man. All right.

325
00:23:26.943 --> 00:23:28.338
>> Here you go.
>> I'm just saying.

326
00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:30.549
>> You got it.

327
00:23:30.584 --> 00:23:32.375
>> Well. there's a carrot.

328
00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:35.114
>> Why did you
stop eating meat?

329
00:23:37.591 --> 00:23:40.086
>> I never liked meat Benny.

330
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:41.692
>> What are you talking about?

331
00:23:41.727 --> 00:23:44.156
We ate meat our whole lives.

332
00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:47.533
>> We were forced to eat meat
our whole lives. James

333
00:23:47.568 --> 00:23:50.503
But I didn't like it.

334
00:23:50.538 --> 00:23:52.329
>> Why didn't you
just say something?

335
00:24:02.506 --> 00:24:06.783
>> Well you've. you've done
good for yourself. Clay.

336
00:24:06.818 --> 00:24:08.719
I never really
thought you'd make it.

337
00:24:08.754 --> 00:24:13.119
Never mind.
never mind all this.

338
00:24:13.154 --> 00:24:16.628
>> Rags to riches
like. literally.

339
00:24:17.464 --> 00:24:20.159
Speaking of which. back to my
proposition about the clubs.

340
00:24:20.194 --> 00:24:24.603
>> James. shut the fuck up about
your business ventures. man.

341
00:24:24.638 --> 00:24:29.938
No one's going to invest in a.
in a chunky club rat.

342
00:24:29.973 --> 00:24:32.171
>> Fuck you. man.

343
00:24:32.206 --> 00:24:33.777
I'm a legitimate businessman.

344
00:24:33.812 --> 00:24:36.780
I am.

345
00:24:36.815 --> 00:24:39.618
>> Hm-Mmm.
>> Fuck all you guys.

346
00:24:39.653 --> 00:24:41.587
>> What I was getting at

347
00:24:41.622 --> 00:24:44.953
what I was getting at
is this kid

348
00:24:44.988 --> 00:24:47.791
couldn't keep himself
from wetting his own bed.

349
00:24:47.826 --> 00:24:51.388
Now he's the owner of a.
of a giant company.

350
00:24:57.869 --> 00:25:02.399
>> So I hear you might lose
your job in your own company.

351
00:25:03.006 --> 00:25:04.038
How does that work?

352
00:25:04.073 --> 00:25:05.611
>> Can I please go to my room?

353
00:25:05.646 --> 00:25:06.777
>> Yes.
>> No.

354
00:25:06.812 --> 00:25:08.779
>> Benny.
>> I said no.

355
00:25:10.013 --> 00:25:12.013
Honey finish your food.

356
00:25:14.413 --> 00:25:15.379
>> Okay.

357
00:25:16.316 --> 00:25:17.854
>> Is that true?

358
00:25:19.583 --> 00:25:22.056
>> Losing your marbles. bro?

359
00:25:22.091 --> 00:25:23.552
Whatever's left of them.

360
00:25:23.587 --> 00:25:27.391
>> Please um. I don't want to
talk about work.

361
00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:30.295
Why. why don't we have dessert?

362
00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.396
>> Mommy. I don't really
feel like dessert.

363
00:25:32.431 --> 00:25:35.003
>> Yes. Yes. you do. honey.

364
00:25:35.038 --> 00:25:38.039
>> Dad.

365
00:25:38.074 --> 00:25:41.240
>> She doesn't have to
have dessert.

366
00:25:41.275 --> 00:25:43.440
>> What did you say?

367
00:25:43.475 --> 00:25:45.211
>> I'm sorry.

368
00:25:45.246 --> 00:25:48.852
>> She's not
your daughter. Clay.

369
00:25:48.887 --> 00:25:50.887
Honey.

370
00:25:50.922 --> 00:25:53.659
why don't you have
some of the cake.

371
00:25:53.694 --> 00:25:57.487
you're incredible.
super smart.

372
00:25:57.522 --> 00:26:01.029
super giving uncle
made for you. okay.

373
00:26:01.064 --> 00:26:07.706
>> Okay.

374
00:26:07.741 --> 00:26:09.466
>> Why are we here bro?

375
00:26:13.637 --> 00:26:17.474
We don't see you for what
ten years maybe?

376
00:26:18.642 --> 00:26:20.609
James. you've seen him.

377
00:26:20.644 --> 00:26:23.447
James hasn't seen you.

378
00:26:23.482 --> 00:26:25.691
I haven't seen you.

379
00:26:25.726 --> 00:26:27.451
They haven't seen you.

380
00:26:28.762 --> 00:26:30.729
Not a call.

381
00:26:30.764 --> 00:26:32.522
Not a visit.

382
00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:40.068
Not even help bailing me out
when I needed it the most.

383
00:26:40.103 --> 00:26:42.301
So why are we here Clay?

384
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.941
Why now?

385
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:52.641
Am I too dumb for you. Clay?

386
00:26:52.676 --> 00:26:53.917
Hm-mmh.
>> No.

387
00:26:53.952 --> 00:26:57.690
>> Not worth responding.

388
00:26:57.725 --> 00:27:00.990
>> I just want to
spend some time together.

389
00:27:01.692 --> 00:27:06.094
Have. be a family.
you know. like.

390
00:27:06.129 --> 00:27:07.293
you know. move past all of this.

391
00:27:07.328 --> 00:27:10.131
>> Move pass what exactly?

392
00:27:11.365 --> 00:27:13.662
The fact that you abandoned us.

393
00:27:13.697 --> 00:27:15.136
>> I didn't.

394
00:27:15.171 --> 00:27:18.502
>> You think I forgot that
you abandoned us Clay.

395
00:27:23.344 --> 00:27:24.915
Is it fucking with your.

396
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:28.952
with your techie zen bullshit.
is that it. bro. hmm?

397
00:27:31.792 --> 00:27:36.553
Or maybe. just maybe
you're going a little. you know?

398
00:27:38.557 --> 00:27:42.229
Cuckoo. cuckoo.

399
00:27:42.731 --> 00:27:46.233
A little cuckoo. hmm.

400
00:27:47.632 --> 00:27:49.632
Please. please.

401
00:27:58.643 --> 00:28:00.412
>> I'm sorry.

402
00:28:05.859 --> 00:28:09.718
Thank you for a lovely evening.

403
00:28:09.753 --> 00:28:11.258
Goodnight.

404
00:28:14.835 --> 00:28:16.164
>> Can I please be excused?

405
00:28:16.199 --> 00:28:18.661
>> Yes. Yes. of course. baby.

406
00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:30.211
>> So we're doing shots?
>> Yes.

407
00:28:47.296 --> 00:28:49.395
>> inhale. exhale.

408
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.232
Where are we Clay?

409
00:28:53.302 --> 00:28:55.302
Breathe. where are we?

410
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.115
>> Round. round and round
and round you go.

411
00:29:09.087 --> 00:29:12.682
Round and round
and round and round.

412
00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:14.992
You will always need me Clay

413
00:29:15.027 --> 00:29:19.260
you will always live in
other people's shadows.

414
00:29:20.263 --> 00:29:24.837
You need to deal with
your problems like a man.

415
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:31.877
Your company is plummeting.

416
00:29:31.912 --> 00:29:35.078
And yes. always
you are incapable

417
00:29:35.113 --> 00:29:37.278
of doing anything about it.

418
00:29:37.313 --> 00:29:41.249
And I'll step in
to save the day and I will.

419
00:29:41.284 --> 00:29:43.647
Because you're my favourite.

420
00:29:43.682 --> 00:29:46.155
Always. my favourite.

421
00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:50.456
I am a man.

422
00:29:50.491 --> 00:29:53.690
and I don't
need your help anymore.

423
00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.663
>> Whose help don't you
need anymore Clay?

424
00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.877
>> I'm doing the best I can.

425
00:30:04.912 --> 00:30:08.738
>> Well. your best is as always.
nowhere near good enough.

426
00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:10.344
>> What's happening Clay?

427
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.579
>> I'm telling you.
I'm telling you.
>> I know.

428
00:30:14.614 --> 00:30:16.922
>> This kid's losing his shit.
>> No.

429
00:30:16.957 --> 00:30:19.287
Any day now.

430
00:30:19.322 --> 00:30:21.289
>> Hopefully we're in his will.

431
00:30:21.324 --> 00:30:22.752
>> Okay. really. really.

432
00:30:22.787 --> 00:30:24.490
Is James thinking about others?

433
00:30:24.525 --> 00:30:26.129
>> I better be in that will.

434
00:30:26.164 --> 00:30:27.691
I didn't come up here
for nothing.

435
00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:32.597
>> Aah. I'm going to
go take a piss.

436
00:30:32.632 --> 00:30:36.403
If I can find a bathroom
in this shithole.

437
00:30:38.143 --> 00:30:39.373
>> Hurry back.
>> No problem.

438
00:30:39.408 --> 00:30:40.704
>> Thank you.

439
00:30:46.987 --> 00:30:47.920
Aah.

440
00:30:50.188 --> 00:30:54.322
>> So how have you been?
>>Really.

441
00:30:54.357 --> 00:30:57.556
>> Come on.
It'll be fun.

442
00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.163
Just one.

443
00:31:01.001 --> 00:31:03.199
>> Just once.

444
00:31:03.234 --> 00:31:06.334
Oh. well. you feel
me on top of you.

445
00:31:06.369 --> 00:31:07.797
You want to feel my tongue?

446
00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:09.975
>> Yeah.

447
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.142
>> Are you my wolf?
>> Oh yeah.

448
00:31:12.177 --> 00:31:15.739
>> Are you my big.
bad fucking wolf?
>> Yeah. baby.

449
00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:17.840
>> Oh. you want to howl for me?
>> Yeah.

450
00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:19.545
>> How bad?
>> Really bad.

451
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.779
>> Keep dreaming.
Get the fuck away from me.

452
00:31:28.391 --> 00:31:30.996
Well. I think I've had
enough for tonight.

453
00:31:31.031 --> 00:31:32.261
I'm a...

454
00:31:34.265 --> 00:31:36.859
I'm going to head upstairs.

455
00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:39.664
Would you like to join me?
>> Mm-hmm.

456
00:31:39.699 --> 00:31:41.765
>> Goodnight James.

457
00:31:45.804 --> 00:31:46.770
>> What?

458
00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:50.642
>> I didn't say anything.

459
00:32:15.273 --> 00:32:16.833
>> Fuck.

460
00:32:18.672 --> 00:32:20.738
Fucking bullshit.

461
00:32:24.051 --> 00:32:26.282
>> There's something
weird about all this shit.

462
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:29.285
>> He's always been odd. okay.

463
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.616
You of all people know this.

464
00:32:30.651 --> 00:32:34.257
Yeah. but not like this.
Never like this.

465
00:32:37.064 --> 00:32:39.328
>> He probably has
cancer or something.

466
00:32:40.859 --> 00:32:43.662
>> I don't know. I'm just
getting a bad vibe somehow.

467
00:32:44.464 --> 00:32:46.962
I just don't know
why we're here.

468
00:32:49.109 --> 00:32:50.834
>> Hey. babe. Hey.

469
00:32:53.938 --> 00:32:55.113
Fuck.

470
00:32:55.148 --> 00:32:57.676
>> You haven't seen him
in a long time.

471
00:32:59.548 --> 00:33:00.877
He's always been
good to us though.

472
00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:02.648
>> Yeah. yeah.

473
00:33:02.683 --> 00:33:05.255
The little creep has
always been good to you.

474
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:07.917
He's never been good to us.

475
00:33:07.952 --> 00:33:09.853
>> Hello.

476
00:33:09.888 --> 00:33:12.493
>> He's acted like.
like I never existed.

477
00:33:12.528 --> 00:33:14.528
the minute he left for college.

478
00:33:14.563 --> 00:33:16.662
>> Benny you never
made it easy for him.

479
00:33:16.697 --> 00:33:17.927
>> What is that
supposed to mean?

480
00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:19.137
>> You know what it means?

481
00:33:19.172 --> 00:33:21.766
He was your
literal punching bag.

482
00:33:21.801 --> 00:33:23.339
>> He had it easy.

483
00:33:25.277 --> 00:33:26.936
Not me.

484
00:33:26.971 --> 00:33:28.509
And not. James.

485
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.349
We took the beatings
every time he fucked up.

486
00:33:34.715 --> 00:33:37.716
We got licked.
fucking literally. always.

487
00:33:37.751 --> 00:33:40.488
so that Clay
could learn a lesson.

488
00:33:40.523 --> 00:33:42.985
And why. hmm?

489
00:33:44.395 --> 00:33:47.693
Why. what did he have
that we didn't?

490
00:33:47.728 --> 00:33:49.926
That I deserved...
>> Okay.

491
00:33:52.535 --> 00:33:58.506
>> Baby you're so. so special.

492
00:33:58.541 --> 00:34:00.541
You're my favourite.

493
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.363
>> Housekeepers?

494
00:34:28.967 --> 00:34:30.571
No. no. I'm coming.

495
00:34:33.642 --> 00:34:35.444
Fuck me.

496
00:35:49.487 --> 00:35:51.454
>> Good morning.

497
00:35:51.489 --> 00:35:53.720
>> Oh. good morning.

498
00:35:59.222 --> 00:36:01.057
You're up early.

499
00:36:22.487 --> 00:36:25.257
>> Is that true
what Benny said last night?

500
00:36:28.559 --> 00:36:30.086
>> About what?

501
00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:33.727
>> Are you going crazy?

502
00:36:33.762 --> 00:36:38.226
>> Oh. no.

503
00:36:38.261 --> 00:36:40.965
I don't think so.

504
00:36:45.774 --> 00:36:47.741
>> Are you sick?

505
00:36:47.776 --> 00:36:49.105
>> No.

506
00:36:52.517 --> 00:36:55.485
Well. Maybe.

507
00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:03.251
Just joking.

508
00:37:03.286 --> 00:37:06.562
>> Oh. good joke.

509
00:37:17.135 --> 00:37:18.937
>> Do you read a lot?

510
00:37:19.775 --> 00:37:21.775
>> Yeah. I find it soothing.

511
00:37:22.976 --> 00:37:24.976
>> You and I both.

512
00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:30.179
>> Astrology.
>> Sorry.

513
00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:32.522
>> It's on astrology.
>> Hm-mmh!

514
00:37:32.557 --> 00:37:35.184
>> Our birthdays give us
our meaning to life.

515
00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:37.758
Sometimes our purpose
in life too.

516
00:37:40.763 --> 00:37:44.732
>> So what's the meaning
to your life?

517
00:37:44.767 --> 00:37:47.735
>> Well. I'm born April 7th.

518
00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:49.935
which makes me an Aries.

519
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:51.970
So that means uh.

520
00:37:55.811 --> 00:37:57.239
I don't actually
believe in this shit.

521
00:37:57.274 --> 00:38:01.177
I just find it interesting.

522
00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:02.783
>> You're funny.

523
00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:09.790
>> Do you know what
the meaning to your life is?

524
00:38:18.438 --> 00:38:21.406
Are you at least
happy with your life?

525
00:38:26.369 --> 00:38:30.206
>> I. don't know.

526
00:38:33.849 --> 00:38:35.849
>> Me neither.

527
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.822
>> What would you change?

528
00:38:46.466 --> 00:38:47.894
>> Love.

529
00:38:49.865 --> 00:38:51.194
>> Love.

530
00:38:53.473 --> 00:38:56.034
>> I wish I had parents
that loved me.

531
00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:03.679
>> They do.

532
00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:08.486
>> They're not parents.

533
00:39:08.521 --> 00:39:11.214
Parents protect their kids.

534
00:39:11.249 --> 00:39:14.052
Or actually take care of them.

535
00:39:14.087 --> 00:39:17.858
Take them to after school
programs. events.

536
00:39:17.893 --> 00:39:20.630
And teach them things.

537
00:39:20.665 --> 00:39:22.830
Mine are just

538
00:39:22.865 --> 00:39:24.865
adult kids.

539
00:39:27.507 --> 00:39:29.474
>> What are
you two nerds. doing?

540
00:39:29.509 --> 00:39:31.234
>> Good morning.

541
00:39:33.876 --> 00:39:36.679
Hey. have you guys.
have you guys seen James?

542
00:39:36.714 --> 00:39:40.045
>> Ah knowing Jay he's probably
passed out under a tree?

543
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.685
>> I mean.
you're probably right.

544
00:39:47.384 --> 00:39:50.253
Hey. Clay.
do you have rackets?

545
00:39:50.288 --> 00:39:51.859
>> I ain't playing tennis.

546
00:39:51.894 --> 00:39:53.355
>> Yes. you are.
>> Uh-uh.

547
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:54.664
>> Yes. you are.
>> No.

548
00:39:54.699 --> 00:39:57.469
>> Come on. please.
please. please. please.

549
00:40:00.199 --> 00:40:02.540
Blair baby.

550
00:40:02.575 --> 00:40:03.431
I am.
>> Okay.

551
00:40:03.466 --> 00:40:05.070
>> And please keep it that way.

552
00:40:05.105 --> 00:40:07.303
>> Yeah you too.
You're dead anyway.

553
00:40:18.118 --> 00:40:21.086
>> Aren't you. uh cold?

554
00:40:21.121 --> 00:40:23.352
>> No.

555
00:40:26.929 --> 00:40:29.567
What were you guys
talking about?

556
00:40:29.602 --> 00:40:30.700
>> Who?

557
00:40:30.735 --> 00:40:33.164
>> You and Clay.

558
00:40:33.199 --> 00:40:35.771
>> Oh. books.

559
00:40:36.573 --> 00:40:40.204
>> Ah. You guys
got that in common. huh?

560
00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:42.206
>> Yeah. I guess.

561
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.380
>> Do you have any book
recommendations for me?

562
00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:54.724
>> What?
>> No.

563
00:40:54.759 --> 00:40:56.561
>> You know. your dad
can read. right?

564
00:40:56.596 --> 00:40:59.597
>> I don't have any
recommendations.

565
00:40:59.632 --> 00:41:03.601
>> I'm just saying we can.
maybe we can do uh.

566
00:41:03.636 --> 00:41:07.396
you know. like a.
like a dad daughter.

567
00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:12.203
like a. like a father
daughter. kind of.

568
00:41:13.646 --> 00:41:16.647
you know. like a
mutual hobby kind of thing.

569
00:41:21.984 --> 00:41:23.984
Yeah. that's not
really my thing. huh.

570
00:41:27.055 --> 00:41:28.857
>> Come on.

571
00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.010
>> Hello.

572
00:41:51.618 --> 00:41:55.279
James. I swear to God.
if you were just.

573
00:41:55.314 --> 00:41:58.546
Clay you scared.
the shit out of me.

574
00:41:58.581 --> 00:42:01.054
>> I'm. I'm sorry.

575
00:42:01.089 --> 00:42:04.189
Oh. I got this one for you.

576
00:42:04.224 --> 00:42:05.696
>> Thank you.

577
00:42:07.227 --> 00:42:08.490
>> What?

578
00:42:10.835 --> 00:42:12.802
>> We really missed you.

579
00:42:21.439 --> 00:42:24.781
>> I missed you guys a lot.
and I should've been there.

580
00:42:24.816 --> 00:42:28.686
I just I can't. I can't.
>> Clay. It's okay.

581
00:42:28.721 --> 00:42:32.481
Just forget it.
Don't worry.

582
00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:41.094
>> You got to
warm up first. okay.
>> Okay.

583
00:42:41.129 --> 00:42:42.425
>> There you go.

584
00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.329
Yeah. Get those
knees up. up. up.

585
00:42:45.364 --> 00:42:47.331
Get your cardio up hon.

586
00:42:48.873 --> 00:42:52.039
You know.
I used to play a little.

587
00:42:52.074 --> 00:42:54.679
>> Oh. okay.
>> I was really good.

588
00:42:54.714 --> 00:42:57.473
Ready. Watch out
it's going to be fast.

589
00:43:06.693 --> 00:43:08.154
That was good. right?

590
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.363
>> Dad. dad. dad. are you okay?
>> Aah.

591
00:43:20.597 --> 00:43:23.598
>> Sorry. sorry.
>> Don't yell.

592
00:43:24.304 --> 00:43:25.677
I'm fine.

593
00:43:25.712 --> 00:43:27.305
>> I won't do that again.

594
00:43:30.112 --> 00:43:32.277
>> Shall we start?

595
00:43:32.312 --> 00:43:34.147
>> What. what are the teams?

596
00:43:34.182 --> 00:43:35.720
>> You're on my team.

597
00:43:35.755 --> 00:43:37.887
>> Where do I go. here?

598
00:43:37.922 --> 00:43:39.152
>> Yeah.

599
00:43:42.421 --> 00:43:45.587
>> Oh.
>> Here you go.

600
00:43:45.622 --> 00:43:48.931
>> Oh. hehehe. Yes.
>> See.

601
00:43:50.627 --> 00:43:52.627
>> Sorry. My ball.
>> Okay.

602
00:43:53.429 --> 00:43:55.971
>> Nice and low. nice and low.
>> Okay.

603
00:43:58.536 --> 00:44:01.339
>> Um. shhh. Sorry.
>> Bend your knees.

604
00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.178
It's okay.

605
00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:14.121
There you go.
>> Aah.

606
00:44:14.156 --> 00:44:16.156
>> Hehehe. yes.

607
00:44:19.557 --> 00:44:21.359
>> It's two for them.
>> Sorry. sorry.

608
00:44:32.779 --> 00:44:34.746
>> There you go. Yes.

609
00:44:35.573 --> 00:44:38.816
>> A winner. yes.

610
00:44:41.216 --> 00:44:42.952
>> Fuck you. that was in.

611
00:44:42.987 --> 00:44:45.383
>> Benny. sometimes
you win. sometimes you lose.

612
00:44:45.418 --> 00:44:49.156
>> That was in.
>> Benny. Come on.

613
00:44:49.191 --> 00:44:51.422
>> Dude. that was in.

614
00:44:59.762 --> 00:45:01.267
>> Benny.

615
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:03.841
Really?

616
00:45:03.876 --> 00:45:06.635
>> You're a cheating a little
scrawny. fuck. you know that.

617
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:07.669
>> Benny. come on.

618
00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:09.737
>> No. fuck this.

619
00:45:09.772 --> 00:45:11.244
>> Benny.

620
00:45:11.884 --> 00:45:13.884
No. no. no. Benny stop.

621
00:45:16.284 --> 00:45:19.021
>> Stay the fuck away
from my girl. you creep.

622
00:45:19.056 --> 00:45:20.649
You didn't think I knew
you were seeing her

623
00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:21.991
when I was on the inside.

624
00:45:22.026 --> 00:45:23.586
>> Benny. Huh?

625
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:31.660
>> Don't.

626
00:46:07.907 --> 00:46:11.667
>> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

627
00:46:15.838 --> 00:46:21.809
What to do. what to do
what to do?

628
00:46:21.844 --> 00:46:24.647
I was only playing.

629
00:46:24.682 --> 00:46:26.814
I just. I was just trying to
play tennis.

630
00:46:26.849 --> 00:46:29.091
I was just trying to
play tennis.

631
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.358
I'm sorry.

632
00:48:03.781 --> 00:48:04.747
>> I'm sorry.

633
00:48:05.618 --> 00:48:06.848
I'm sorry.

634
00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:09.422
>> Round and round
and round you go.

635
00:48:09.457 --> 00:48:12.458
Beyond the shadows
you must go.

636
00:48:20.963 --> 00:48:23.975
Round and round
and round and round.

637
00:48:47.495 --> 00:48:48.791
>> What is this?

638
00:49:37.116 --> 00:49:40.678
>> Tell me what's happening.

639
00:49:40.713 --> 00:49:42.911
>> Please just stop it.
stop. stop.

640
00:49:42.946 --> 00:49:46.123
>> Clay. just breathe.
>> Stop it.

641
00:49:46.158 --> 00:49:48.092
>> Where are we Clay?

642
00:49:48.127 --> 00:49:50.017
>> Why does he always hurt me?

643
00:49:50.052 --> 00:49:51.689
>> Who's hurting you?

644
00:49:51.724 --> 00:49:54.065
>> It was my brother.

645
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:55.099
>> Why does he hate me?

646
00:49:55.134 --> 00:49:57.662
>> You need to
let him go. Clay.

647
00:49:57.697 --> 00:49:59.301
You need to set him free.

648
00:49:59.336 --> 00:50:02.337
>> When will we stop this Clay?

649
00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:15.251
You can't be fixed.

650
00:50:15.286 --> 00:50:19.255
You shake. you. you tremble

651
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:20.553
you can't be fixed.

652
00:50:20.588 --> 00:50:23.490
You. you left me alone.
>> No.

653
00:50:23.525 --> 00:50:24.689
>> You ran away.

654
00:50:24.724 --> 00:50:27.527
You abandoned
the family Clayton.

655
00:50:29.927 --> 00:50:34.171
>> She can't help you.
but I can.

656
00:50:34.206 --> 00:50:37.207
>> Could you?
>> Please.

657
00:50:38.606 --> 00:50:42.971
Please what.
please what?

658
00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:46.513
You're so weak.
so pathetic.

659
00:50:46.548 --> 00:50:50.011
>> It's okay Clay.
Clay I got you.

660
00:50:52.158 --> 00:50:56.127
Just breathe.
Tell me what's happening.

661
00:50:56.162 --> 00:50:58.954
Clay. stay right here.

662
00:51:17.216 --> 00:51:18.974
>> Rough day.

663
00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:24.386
>> And who are you
supposed to be?

664
00:51:24.421 --> 00:51:26.388
>> Denver Kane.

665
00:51:26.423 --> 00:51:29.193
>> And when did you get here
Mr. Kane?

666
00:51:29.228 --> 00:51:32.163
>> Denver please.
>> Right.

667
00:51:32.198 --> 00:51:35.430
>> May I?
>> Please.

668
00:51:43.242 --> 00:51:47.772
>> It's such a weak
man's characteristic to

669
00:51:47.807 --> 00:51:50.577
actually strike a woman.

670
00:51:50.612 --> 00:51:53.844
such a beautiful way
to mock you.

671
00:51:54.813 --> 00:51:57.815
>> And you're. you're what.
you're a strongman.

672
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.431
>> A truly strong man.

673
00:52:09.466 --> 00:52:15.371
Who knows exactly what to do
with his hands for a woman.

674
00:52:15.406 --> 00:52:17.406
>> Is that right?

675
00:52:17.441 --> 00:52:20.838
>> Yes.
>> Hmm!

676
00:52:20.873 --> 00:52:23.005
How so?

677
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.380
>> Depends.

678
00:52:24.415 --> 00:52:29.220
It really does. depend.

679
00:52:30.487 --> 00:52:33.719
>> And it depends on what?

680
00:52:53.906 --> 00:52:55.906
Oh. yes.

681
00:53:08.921 --> 00:53:10.921
What the heck?

682
00:53:18.304 --> 00:53:21.305
>> Round and round and
round and round

683
00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:25.672
and round and round and round

684
00:53:25.707 --> 00:53:28.873
round and round. round.

685
00:53:28.908 --> 00:53:30.479
>> James.

686
00:53:57.574 --> 00:54:02.137
>> Round and round
and round and round and round.

687
00:54:04.581 --> 00:54:06.108
>> James.

688
00:54:50.187 --> 00:54:51.956
>> Really. he's doing
much better.

689
00:54:51.991 --> 00:54:53.221
>> Oh. that's good news.

690
00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:55.223
>> However. the damage to
the frontal lobe.

691
00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:56.994
that's going to be challenging.

692
00:54:57.029 --> 00:54:58.259
>> Okay.

693
00:54:58.294 --> 00:55:00.404
You've said he's doing
better though. correct?

694
00:55:00.439 --> 00:55:02.571
>> Well. we won't know the
full extent of his mental state

695
00:55:02.606 --> 00:55:04.232
until he's recovered from
the current state

696
00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:05.772
that he's in right now.

697
00:55:05.807 --> 00:55:07.972
His motor controls are
completely diminished.

698
00:55:08.007 --> 00:55:10.480
except for some
sensory feelings.

699
00:55:11.373 --> 00:55:12.977
>> So when can
I take him home?

700
00:55:13.012 --> 00:55:16.079
>> We'll have to take that day
by day as the court ordered.

701
00:55:16.114 --> 00:55:17.212
He's still a threat to
his own life

702
00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:19.819
and perhaps those around him.

703
00:55:19.854 --> 00:55:21.656
>> He can't move.
how can he be violent?

704
00:55:21.691 --> 00:55:24.659
>> I know this is difficult
for you. sweetheart.

705
00:55:24.694 --> 00:55:26.463
but until I can assess
his mental state.

706
00:55:26.498 --> 00:55:28.861
I cannot advise
that he'd be released.

707
00:55:28.896 --> 00:55:30.698
Okay. please understand.

708
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.438
Now your visits are very good
for him and I'd recommend

709
00:55:34.473 --> 00:55:37.804
you continue to see him
as much as possible. okay.

710
00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:39.839
>> Of course.
>> Okay.

711
00:55:49.488 --> 00:55:51.246
Hey. baby.

712
00:55:58.629 --> 00:56:00.057
We need to get you a haircut.

713
00:56:04.701 --> 00:56:06.701
Maybe also a beard trim.

714
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:10.672
You are looking
rather distinguished.

715
00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:15.237
Sorry Blair couldn't be here.

716
00:56:17.681 --> 00:56:21.243
She is on her way to
her future mother in laws.

717
00:56:23.115 --> 00:56:25.115
For a wedding outfitting.

718
00:56:29.528 --> 00:56:31.957
So strange that she's
getting married so soon.

719
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:44.772
Can you hear me?

720
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.339
Please. please. just say
something baby.

721
00:57:00.559 --> 00:57:02.284
>> Sorry. to interrupt ma'am.

722
00:57:03.562 --> 00:57:04.286
>> Oh.

723
00:57:10.701 --> 00:57:12.294
I got to get going anyway.

724
00:57:43.998 --> 00:57:48.363
>> I wonder what's going through
that head of yours?

725
00:57:48.398 --> 00:57:52.136
Honestly. I can't imagine

726
00:57:52.171 --> 00:57:54.743
what it'd be like to be
trapped in my own mind.

727
00:57:55.779 --> 00:58:00.210
Not being able to move or
control anything in my life.

728
00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.787
Do I bother you.
Mr. Amani?

729
00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:11.221
You don't like me washing
your balls and your armpits?

730
00:58:13.192 --> 00:58:16.523
Maybe too much.

731
00:58:16.558 --> 00:58:19.031
Fuck you.

732
00:58:19.666 --> 00:58:22.573
I mean. do you think I
want to fucking be here.

733
00:58:22.608 --> 00:58:26.368
I mean. you. it's your
own fault that you're here.

734
00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:30.273
You're weak.

735
00:58:32.013 --> 00:58:33.782
You know what?

736
00:58:35.082 --> 00:58:39.623
Immobile patients
drown. all the time.

737
00:58:40.626 --> 00:58:42.659
Accidents happen. right?

738
00:58:44.025 --> 00:58:46.289
And come.
come to think of it.

739
00:58:46.324 --> 00:58:49.457
you were in
an accident. right. Clay?

740
00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:52.031
That's how you
ended up adopted.

741
00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:58.840
That brain of yours
is incredible.

742
00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:02.008
It's extraordinary even.

743
00:59:02.043 --> 00:59:04.472
Building software technology.

744
00:59:05.541 --> 00:59:07.882
But now.

745
00:59:07.917 --> 00:59:10.687
round and round. you go

746
00:59:10.722 --> 00:59:14.416
into the shadows.
you will go.

747
00:59:17.696 --> 00:59:19.894
Hey. hey.

748
00:59:19.929 --> 00:59:22.930
It's okay. it's okay.

749
00:59:24.329 --> 00:59:26.329
It'll be quick.

750
00:59:26.364 --> 00:59:29.596
I know. I know.
you don't want to go. I know.

751
00:59:29.631 --> 00:59:32.434
It's time for you to go.

752
00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:34.469
I'm going to set you free.

753
00:59:54.733 --> 00:59:55.622
What did you do?

754
00:59:55.657 --> 00:59:57.668
What did you do?
What did you do?

755
01:00:20.759 --> 01:00:21.692
>> Clay.

756
01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.388
Where is everyone?

757
01:00:39.778 --> 01:00:41.503
>> What'd you do.
what'd you do. what did you do?

758
01:00:49.755 --> 01:00:50.985
Clarissa.

759
01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:05.527
Oh my.

760
01:01:19.741 --> 01:01:23.017
>> Oh.

761
01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:31.993
>> What the hell happened?

762
01:01:32.028 --> 01:01:34.259
>> I found the tequila
bottle out there.

763
01:01:38.232 --> 01:01:40.463
>> I saw James.

764
01:01:40.498 --> 01:01:42.465
I fucking saw James.

765
01:01:43.401 --> 01:01:46.975
First. there was a shed
and it was purple and...

766
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:52.783
Oh my God. oh my God.

767
01:01:52.818 --> 01:01:54.576
James is dead.

768
01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:55.819
James is fucking dead.

769
01:01:58.384 --> 01:02:00.186
Where. where's. where's Benny
and where's Blair

770
01:02:00.221 --> 01:02:03.453
and. and. and where we're at?

771
01:02:03.488 --> 01:02:05.389
I don't know. I don't know.

772
01:02:05.424 --> 01:02:06.863
I just I...

773
01:02:06.898 --> 01:02:10.691
>> Stop. stop. you're fine.
you're fine. you're fine.

774
01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:12.627
I just saw them.
>> No.

775
01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:13.837
>> I just saw them.
>> No.

776
01:02:13.872 --> 01:02:16.631
James's body is in
a purple shed.

777
01:02:17.799 --> 01:02:19.601
I. I.

778
01:02:29.085 --> 01:02:32.680
>> Clarissa listen.
stay with me. breathe okay.

779
01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:35.023
Look at me. look at me.
look at me.

780
01:02:37.258 --> 01:02:38.895
You're going to be okay.

781
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:40.721
I'll take care of you.

782
01:02:42.824 --> 01:02:44.230
I believe you.

783
01:02:44.265 --> 01:02:46.430
We just need to
get back home

784
01:02:46.465 --> 01:02:48.267
and sort things out.

785
01:02:48.769 --> 01:02:51.303
And make things right. okay.

786
01:03:24.338 --> 01:03:26.877
>> Round and round
and round. you go

787
01:03:26.912 --> 01:03:29.704
into the shadows
you must go.

788
01:03:30.872 --> 01:03:33.840
Round and round.
round and round

789
01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:36.678
into the shadows you go.

790
01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.780
Hello. Benny.

791
01:03:40.354 --> 01:03:43.685
>> Fuck. Fuck you.

792
01:03:44.721 --> 01:03:46.490
>> It's time. Benny.

793
01:03:46.525 --> 01:03:48.294
I know. I know.

794
01:03:48.329 --> 01:03:51.935
I know. I know you
don't want to go.

795
01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:53.904
but it's time.

796
01:03:53.939 --> 01:03:54.971
>> I can't take it.

797
01:03:55.006 --> 01:03:58.535
>> You need to set him free.

798
01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:01.703
You're scared.
you're scared. you're sorry.

799
01:04:01.738 --> 01:04:04.871
For what were you
scared of sorry?

800
01:04:04.906 --> 01:04:07.148
>> I'm sorry.

801
01:04:07.183 --> 01:04:09.183
>> Are you sorry?
Are you sorry?

802
01:04:09.218 --> 01:04:10.778
>> I'm sorry.
>> Are you scared?

803
01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.351
I said. I'm sorry.

804
01:04:12.386 --> 01:04:14.782
>> Say it louder.
>> I'm sorry.

805
01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:16.993
>> You lie.
>> I'm sorry.

806
01:04:17.028 --> 01:04:18.929
>> Lies.
>> I'm sorry.

807
01:04:18.964 --> 01:04:20.931
>> I'm sorry.

808
01:04:29.205 --> 01:04:33.207
>> You will be shot.

809
01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:39.807
>> I didn't do anything.
I. I made mistakes.

810
01:04:40.381 --> 01:04:42.018
I made mistakes.

811
01:04:42.053 --> 01:04:45.747
I. I tried really.

812
01:04:45.782 --> 01:04:46.957
>> Goodbye Benny.
>> No.

813
01:05:06.407 --> 01:05:07.868
Goodbye.

814
01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:24.093
>> Hey. baby.

815
01:05:25.294 --> 01:05:26.821
You okay?

816
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:30.462
>> Benny's gone.

817
01:05:30.497 --> 01:05:32.794
>> Wait. what
do you mean. gone?

818
01:05:35.106 --> 01:05:36.633
Blair.

819
01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:40.868
What is she talking about Clay?

820
01:05:42.674 --> 01:05:44.674
What is she talking about?

821
01:05:45.677 --> 01:05:47.215
>> They're gone.

822
01:05:48.119 --> 01:05:49.877
>> What did you say?

823
01:05:51.122 --> 01:05:52.451
>> They're gone.

824
01:05:55.126 --> 01:05:57.918
>> I need you to speak up.

825
01:05:57.953 --> 01:06:00.723
And I need you to
be a fucking man.

826
01:06:07.666 --> 01:06:08.995
>> I am a man.

827
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:13.901
No. I am a man.

828
01:06:15.542 --> 01:06:16.673
Clarissa.

829
01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:18.048
>> Blair.

830
01:06:22.318 --> 01:06:23.878
Benny.

831
01:06:25.046 --> 01:06:26.551
Benny.

832
01:06:28.489 --> 01:06:32.524
Ben. where did...

833
01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:34.064
Where are they?

834
01:06:34.099 --> 01:06:35.131
Where are they Clay?

835
01:06:35.166 --> 01:06:39.498
>> Stop. Stop it.

836
01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.868
I won't ever hurt you again.

837
01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:50.179
We can finally be together.
we can be a family.

838
01:06:51.578 --> 01:06:52.973
>> You won't hurt me?

839
01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:54.150
>> Mom.

840
01:06:54.185 --> 01:06:56.284
>> Baby it's okay. it's okay.

841
01:06:56.319 --> 01:07:00.013
Don't be scared. okay.
everything's. everything's fine.

842
01:07:07.165 --> 01:07:09.132
>> I've been good to everyone.

843
01:07:10.828 --> 01:07:13.994
Haven't I?
>> Yes.

844
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:16.139
>> Haven't I?
>> Yes. Yes.

845
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:23.575
Dinner will be ready soon.

846
01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:25.577
You should both
get cleaned up.

847
01:07:25.612 --> 01:07:27.414
You're filthy.

848
01:07:28.846 --> 01:07:33.189
Oh it's your favourite dishes.

849
01:07:33.224 --> 01:07:35.752
I'm so excited.

850
01:07:38.427 --> 01:07:41.395
Oh. and.

851
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:44.761
please don't be late.

852
01:08:03.188 --> 01:08:04.979
>> I've been calling.

853
01:08:06.587 --> 01:08:09.951
I call you answer.

854
01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:11.788
That's how this works.

855
01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:16.958
What do you think you're doing.
Clayton playing house?

856
01:08:16.993 --> 01:08:18.993
While. I take out the trash.

857
01:08:20.667 --> 01:08:22.964
Need I remind you?

858
01:08:25.243 --> 01:08:29.443
That I raised you.
I raised you.

859
01:08:30.446 --> 01:08:34.041
I made you.
and you were my favourite.

860
01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:36.417
You had such promise.

861
01:08:36.452 --> 01:08:38.221
Then you ran away.

862
01:08:38.256 --> 01:08:40.982
You ran away.

863
01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:42.225
You ripped us apart.

864
01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.458
You are spitting
on my sacrifices

865
01:08:44.493 --> 01:08:46.460
and continue to do so.

866
01:08:46.495 --> 01:08:50.156
I want you to come back to
what is important.

867
01:08:50.191 --> 01:08:52.631
us. and our company.

868
01:08:52.666 --> 01:08:55.161
You need to
come back to me.

869
01:08:55.196 --> 01:08:59.704
To me. boy. boy. boy.

870
01:09:02.445 --> 01:09:04.137
It ends tonight?

871
01:09:09.287 --> 01:09:11.485
No Denver. please.

872
01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.324
Please Denver. Denver.

873
01:10:38.376 --> 01:10:40.937
>> Would you like
some salad Clay?

874
01:10:42.237 --> 01:10:56.359
>> Yes. darling. I would.

875
01:10:56.394 --> 01:10:58.394
Oh let me help you.

876
01:11:02.565 --> 01:11:07.128
Can you get that?

877
01:11:07.163 --> 01:11:08.437
Thank you.

878
01:11:18.845 --> 01:11:20.141
>> Thank you.

879
01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:21.648
>> Of course.

880
01:11:30.791 --> 01:11:32.791
>> It's the outside fork.

881
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:52.448
I was thinking you should take
up coding. sweetheart.

882
01:11:52.483 --> 01:11:54.274
I'm talking to you.

883
01:11:56.817 --> 01:11:58.817
>> Like computer coding.

884
01:12:00.887 --> 01:12:02.183
>> Mm-hmm.

885
01:12:04.121 --> 01:12:13.799
>> I'm not really into that.

886
01:12:13.834 --> 01:12:18.001
>> You'll learn
to be into it. like me.

887
01:12:18.036 --> 01:12:20.234
We'll start a company
together someday.

888
01:12:54.072 --> 01:12:55.676
Why aren't you eating?

889
01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:02.408
I asked a question.

890
01:13:02.443 --> 01:13:05.246
I ask and you answer.
that's how this works.

891
01:13:07.723 --> 01:13:10.152
>> What is this?

892
01:13:10.187 --> 01:13:12.253
What are we doing Clay?

893
01:13:12.288 --> 01:13:14.288
And why are
we dressed like this?

894
01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:24.936
>> I'm trying to
have a nice family dinner.

895
01:13:27.545 --> 01:13:28.940
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

896
01:13:28.975 --> 01:13:31.074
I just really. will you stop.

01:13:31.109 --> 01:13:33.516
Blair. baby. get up.
We're going.

898
01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.519
>> Sit right there
and don't move.
>> Blair Baby. get up.

899
01:13:36.554 --> 01:13:38.521
We're going home.

900
01:13:39.722 --> 01:13:42.525
>> Can you please
come back to the table?

901
01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.792
We're having a dinner.
>> Get up. baby.

902
01:13:47.488 --> 01:13:53.360
>> No.

Please sit down.

904
01:13:55.738 --> 01:13:58.464
Sit down.

905
01:13:58.499 --> 01:14:01.544
You're ruining dinner.

906
01:14:02.503 --> 01:14:05.240
Eat your food.
>> I can't.

907
01:14:07.981 --> 01:14:10.982
>> Baby let's go. let's go.

908
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:15.756
>> Why are you being
so ungrateful

909
01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:17.560
after everything
I've done for you.

910
01:14:17.595 --> 01:14:21.729
you are spitting
on my sacrifices.

911
01:14:21.764 --> 01:14:23.423
>> Where's James. Clay

912
01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:24.765
and where's Benny?

913
01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:32.333
Stop. asking for him.

914
01:14:32.368 --> 01:14:34.973
I've done everything for you.
haven't I?

915
01:14:36.273 --> 01:14:38.779
I've been good to you.
haven't I?

916
01:14:38.814 --> 01:14:41.342
>> Please.

917
01:14:42.378 --> 01:14:43.784
>> Do you want to know?

918
01:14:43.819 --> 01:14:46.589
>> Please. Clay
where is Benny?

919
01:14:46.624 --> 01:14:48.591
>> He's gone.

920
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:51.022
Gone.

921
01:14:55.996 --> 01:14:58.458
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

922
01:15:05.203 --> 01:15:07.203
I'm trying to protect you.

923
01:15:07.238 --> 01:15:09.502
Trying to protect
both of you.

924
01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:16.784
>> No. get away from me.
get away from me.

925
01:15:16.819 --> 01:15:19.380
>> Don't say that.
don't say that.

926
01:15:26.092 --> 01:15:28.389
>> Are you ready
to face the traumas?

927
01:15:35.596 --> 01:15:37.068
>> Yes.

928
01:15:38.676 --> 01:15:39.873
>> Good.

929
01:15:42.042 --> 01:15:46.044
Why don't you start with the
earliest memory of your father?

930
01:15:54.692 --> 01:15:58.584
>> Okay. My father's name
was Denver Kane.

931
01:16:01.127 --> 01:16:03.864
He took me in
at the age of four.

932
01:16:03.899 --> 01:16:06.064
>> Okay.

933
01:16:06.099 --> 01:16:07.703
It's okay. stay with me. Clay.

934
01:16:07.738 --> 01:16:09.705
stay with me. what else?

935
01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:12.070
>> No.
>> Clay.

936
01:16:12.908 --> 01:16:13.874
>> No.

937
01:16:13.909 --> 01:16:15.370
I should've been there

938
01:16:15.405 --> 01:16:18.879
I could have protected them
I. I could have saved them.

939
01:16:19.548 --> 01:16:24.346
>> You need to get rid of
the guilt and the fears.

940
01:16:24.381 --> 01:16:26.689
You need to let them go. Clay.

941
01:16:46.942 --> 01:16:49.503
>> You need to
kill off the guilt.

942
01:16:57.414 --> 01:16:59.084
>> I should have been there.

943
01:16:59.119 --> 01:17:00.580
I should have been there.

944
01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:06.652
I should have been there.

945
01:17:06.687 --> 01:17:09.523
I could have saved them.

946
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.591
>> End this.

947
01:17:18.743 --> 01:17:20.908
>> What did you do Clay?

948
01:17:20.943 --> 01:17:23.504
>> What did you do.
what did you do. Clay?

949
01:17:26.146 --> 01:17:28.509
>> This must end tonight. Clay.

950
01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:32.348
They must all be gone.
>> No.

951
01:17:32.955 --> 01:17:35.582
>> She must go.

952
01:17:35.617 --> 01:17:40.521
They all must go.
>> No.

953
01:17:40.556 --> 01:17:43.128
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

954
01:17:43.163 --> 01:17:44.657
You're okay.

955
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:48.694
It's OK. come out.

956
01:17:48.729 --> 01:17:50.773
>> You just. kill me.
kill me. kill me.

957
01:17:50.808 --> 01:17:51.741
>> No.

958
01:18:18.033 --> 01:18:19.835
Didn't mean to hurt you.

959
01:18:31.849 --> 01:18:33.783
Please. It's okay. come out.

960
01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:40.581
Blair.

961
01:18:46.061 --> 01:18:48.589
>> This is all your fault.

962
01:18:48.624 --> 01:18:50.624
>> I'm sorry.

963
01:18:51.792 --> 01:18:53.297
>> Blair.

964
01:18:55.433 --> 01:18:57.235
>> It's too late. Clay.

965
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:58.764
You couldn't save us.

966
01:18:58.799 --> 01:19:00.634
You can save her.

967
01:19:03.804 --> 01:19:05.639
>> I'm sorry.

968
01:19:08.644 --> 01:19:10.710
>> You were his favourite.

969
01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:13.823
He did this for you.
for you. for you. for you.

970
01:19:28.103 --> 01:19:31.907
>> Blair. I'll protect you now.

971
01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:35.735
>> Stay away from me.

972
01:19:37.079 --> 01:19:38.771
Stay away from me.

973
01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:43.853
>> Blair.

974
01:19:44.284 --> 01:19:45.481
Blair.

975
01:19:50.092 --> 01:19:51.322
Blair.

976
01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:52.895
Blair.

977
01:19:57.858 --> 01:20:00.661
>> Help! Help! Help!

978
01:20:00.696 --> 01:20:02.168
>> Ahh!

979
01:20:29.725 --> 01:20:32.198
>> It all ends tonight.

980
01:20:39.405 --> 01:20:41.702
>> No. no. no.

981
01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:43.913
You just stay with me.
stay with me. stay with me.

982
01:20:43.948 --> 01:20:45.310
Stay with me. stay with me.

983
01:20:45.345 --> 01:20:47.147
Oh my god.
oh my God. oh my God.

984
01:20:47.182 --> 01:20:48.874
No. no.

985
01:20:48.909 --> 01:20:52.185
Oh God.

986
01:21:28.949 --> 01:21:30.784
I'm sorry.

987
01:21:32.392 --> 01:21:34.590
I should have protected you.

988
01:21:35.225 --> 01:21:37.967
I should have protected you.

989
01:21:38.002 --> 01:21:42.565
>> Round and round
and round you go.

990
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.865
Into the shadows.
Clay must go.

991
01:21:49.046 --> 01:21:51.178
I did this for us. Clay.

992
01:21:51.213 --> 01:21:53.642
>> It needs to
end tonight. Clay.

993
01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:57.778
You must
move past all the guilt.

994
01:21:57.813 --> 01:22:02.420
You must kill
all of the trauma.

995
01:22:03.654 --> 01:22:06.226
You must finish this.

996
01:22:06.261 --> 01:22:08.888
>> You've always been
my favourite.

997
01:22:08.923 --> 01:22:12.034
I did this. so you would
come back to me

998
01:22:12.069 --> 01:22:14.696
and I could
keep you to myself.

999
01:22:14.731 --> 01:22:18.733
Keep you all to myself forever.

1000
01:22:30.285 --> 01:22:34.089
I've always been
good to you. Clayton. haven't I?

1001
01:22:37.457 --> 01:22:40.920
I've always been
good to you. haven't I?

1002
01:22:46.103 --> 01:22:50.072
It must end tonight. Clay.

1003
01:22:50.107 --> 01:22:52.338
You must set yourself free.

1004
01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:59.279
>> I forgive you father.

1005
01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.845
>> My favourite.

1006
01:23:05.518 --> 01:23:08.057
>> Always and forever.

1007
01:24:57.663 --> 01:24:58.959
Sorry.

1008
01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:07.896
>> Where are we
right now. Clay?

1009
01:26:10.736 --> 01:26:13.066
Clay. where are we
right now?

1010
01:26:14.872 --> 01:26:16.872
>> It's done.

1011
01:26:18.546 --> 01:26:20.073
>> What's done?

1012
01:26:24.354 --> 01:26:26.145
>> I set them free.

1013
01:26:27.082 --> 01:26:30.886
I set myself free.

1014
01:26:32.527 --> 01:26:36.298
>> How do you feel about that?

1015
01:26:41.536 --> 01:26:43.536
>> The best that I can.

1016
01:26:47.377 --> 01:26:48.904
>> Good.

1017
01:26:54.912 --> 01:27:00.487
I am so proud of you Clay.

1018
01:27:00.522 --> 01:27:03.017
You had a breakthrough
here today.

1019
01:27:05.285 --> 01:27:08.693
You dealt with a lot.

1020
01:27:08.728 --> 01:27:11.465
You were
able to kill off a lot

1021
01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:15.535
of the pain and the agony.

1022
01:27:17.572 --> 01:27:20.573
You were able to
kill off the guilts.

1023
01:27:21.378 --> 01:27:23.906
You faced the ones you loved

1024
01:27:23.941 --> 01:27:26.205
and the ones who lost.

1025
01:27:28.517 --> 01:27:31.551
This will help you find
the peace within you.

1026
01:27:33.984 --> 01:27:35.324
>> Thank you.

1027
01:27:38.021 --> 01:27:42.188
>> Be kind to yourself
for these next few days.

1028
01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:44.223
Take things slow.

1029
01:28:09.987 --> 01:28:12.394
>> I'll see you next week.

1030
01:28:12.429 --> 01:28:15.430
>> If you need to
you know where to find me.

1031
01:28:38.455 --> 01:28:39.388
>> Hey.

1032
01:29:55.125 --> 01:29:56.465
>> Sir.

1033
01:30:00.097 --> 01:30:02.768
