4
00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:00.208
Thank you.

5
00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:25.208
There is a driving force
that's greater than human willpower

6
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:30.041
which allows us to perform colossal tasks

7
00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:34.000
that are almost beyond human ability.

8
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:39.583
And that great force is neither physical.
tangible. nor material.

9
00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:44.958
it lies within the very spirit
of every human being.

10
00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:50.458
That great force that inspires us
to keep moving forward...

11
00:02:52.583 --> 00:02:54.375
is called faith.

12
00:02:57.041 --> 00:03:00.625
When we Franciscans came to this land.

13
00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:04.916
we ventured deeper inland
than swords ever could.

14
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.708
And our only weapon was a crucifix

15
00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:13.250
together with words of life
and consolation.

16
00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:20.250
The natives became very fond
of our Blessed Mother's images.

17
00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:33.833
Praise and bless my Lord

18
00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:35.791
and thank Him. brothers.

19
00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:39.666
but always thank and follow Him
with great humility.

20
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.250
With joy.

21
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.541
Thank and serve Him. but serve Him
with great humility for Sister Water.

22
00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:05.291
May the Lord assist you
by the grace of the Holy Spirit

23
00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:08.250
so that. freed of your sins...

24
00:05:19.416 --> 00:05:20.583
Why?

25
00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.875
My God. Why?

26
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.541
Something caught my eye from afar.

27
00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:38.833
Hidden among the copious mesquite trees
in the distance.

28
00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:43.708
sprawling in the age-old darkness.
laid the village of Mezquititlán.

29
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:34.666
Do you like her?

30
00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:45.416
Something here inside tells me

31
00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:51.000
that you will take special care
of our Mother.

32
00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:26.208
MEXICO CITY

33
00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:29.708
I don't know what to do
because he won't pay me.

34
00:07:29.791 --> 00:07:31.208
He's a tightfisted one.

35
00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:34.750
The problem is
that I already delivered the order.

36
00:07:34.833 --> 00:07:37.833
That's right.
You already delivered the order.

37
00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:50.333
Carmen. What are you doing this weekend?

38
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.375
I'm visiting my parents in Tultepec.
I haven't seen them in ages.

39
00:07:56.083 --> 00:08:00.708
Carmen. how I wish we could go back
to where we grew up. remember?

40
00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:05.791
I remember. I'd like that too.

41
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:09.750
But sometimes we just can't.
Maybe when Pancho gets a raise.

42
00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:14.500
Move it. ladies.
We need to meet our production goal.

43
00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:17.958
Don't worry. I've even finished
this weekend's quota.

44
00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:19.541
Good job.

45
00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:22.875
If not. I couldn't give you
those days off for your trip.

46
00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.500
I'll work two extra hours
to meet my quota.

47
00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:29.750
What about you?
You're always busy chatting.

48
00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:33.250
Who. me? I'm doing a great job as usual.

49
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.500
Get back to work.

50
00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:11.000
-Pancho. the boss needs you.
-Okay.

51
00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:22.125
I gave them ten years of my life.
How can they do this to me?

52
00:09:22.208 --> 00:09:27.375
Pancho. you're always late.
you show up drunk.

53
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.166
you never meet your deadlines.

54
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.583
I can't help you like that.

55
00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:36.291
Please understand. I have a family.
My wife and I both work.

56
00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.875
But we barely make enough for expenses.

57
00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.750
Give me another chance.

58
00:09:40.833 --> 00:09:43.916
I can't. Pancho. Orders from above.

59
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.333
Then transfer me. boss. please.

60
00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.666
Here's your severance pay. Pancho.
I'm sorry.

61
00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:55.666
Pancho.

62
00:09:59.208 --> 00:10:00.333
Quit that stuff.

63
00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:04.500
Be strong.

64
00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:17.916
This one.

65
00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:23.500
-How much is this dress. Miss?
-4.500.

66
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.833
But we have a layaway plan.

67
00:10:26.916 --> 00:10:29.500
-Thank you. You're very kind.
-You're welcome.

68
00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:32.333
Is this the one you like?

69
00:10:36.416 --> 00:10:38.666
You'll look gorgeous in this dress. Gaby.

70
00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:46.583
Did you guys take everything up?

71
00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:49.333
I did.

72
00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:52.458
-Gaby. did you take everything up?
-Can we buy another one?

73
00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:54.166
Yes. Later.

74
00:10:56.875 --> 00:10:58.416
Hurry up. Carmen!

75
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.666
Coming!

76
00:11:08.208 --> 00:11:11.833
TEYAHUALCO. TULTEPEC. STATE OF MEXICO

77
00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:23.458
-Grandma!
-Honey!

78
00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.333
I'm so glad to see you. honey!

79
00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:28.500
-Go ahead.
-Darling!

80
00:11:28.583 --> 00:11:32.375
You're a sight for sore eyes.
my beautiful girl!

81
00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:35.708
-Hi.
-Mother-in-law.

82
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:39.791
-Why haven't you come to see us?
-Work.

83
00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:42.625
-What's up. Pancho?
-Gerónimo.

84
00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:43.875
-Come in.
-Thank you.

85
00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.416
It's a miracle you came to see us.
We missed you guys.

86
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:51.083
We missed you too.

87
00:11:51.166 --> 00:11:54.833
Your job prevents you from coming.
Right. honey?

88
00:11:54.916 --> 00:11:57.375
But it's great you could make it today.

89
00:11:57.458 --> 00:11:58.875
-Please have a seat.
-Yes.

90
00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.250
And how's my Gaby?

91
00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:03.583
Gaby. your grandma's talking to you.

92
00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:05.083
I'm fine. Grandma.

93
00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:09.208
She's so tall. isn't she?
And you're beautiful. honey.

94
00:12:09.916 --> 00:12:13.333
-You have a boyfriend. right?
-Mom. she's just a kid.

95
00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:16.208
I think you have a boyfriend.
Right. honey?

96
00:12:16.291 --> 00:12:18.500
No. my parents still won't let me.

97
00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:21.500
We'll see when she's 15.

98
00:12:21.583 --> 00:12:25.583
That's pretty soon.
in just five months.

99
00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:29.583
-You're throwing her a party. right?
-We're on it. ma'am.

100
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:33.708
Carmen's working overtime
to help pay for it.

101
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.833
Don't forget to invite us.
You've forgotten all about us.

102
00:12:40.916 --> 00:12:43.333
We certainly will. ma'am.

103
00:12:43.416 --> 00:12:45.333
How much have you saved?

104
00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:50.500
We've only got 20.000 pesos.
We've had a few issues.

105
00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:52.583
Let me see your drawings. Gaby.

106
00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:56.708
I have some savings. it's not much.

107
00:12:56.791 --> 00:13:00.291
but I'd like to chip in
for my Gaby's birthday.

108
00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:03.500
-That won't be necessary.
-We'd appreciate it if you could.

109
00:13:03.583 --> 00:13:04.750
I'd love to.

110
00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:08.083
Honey. please. You have to accept it.

111
00:13:08.166 --> 00:13:11.916
-No. that's really not necessary.
-Sure it is. honey.

112
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.333
Your dad and I will check our savings.

113
00:13:15.416 --> 00:13:19.041
We'll love to help you out.
Right. honey?

114
00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:22.083
We'll definitely be there
for the family. honey.

115
00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:25.291
And yes. it is necessary. ma'am.
Thank you.

116
00:13:25.375 --> 00:13:27.541
It is not. Pancho. I'm telling you.

117
00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:30.666
Don't do this to me in front of my folks.

118
00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:34.750
What's wrong with accepting
your parents' help?

119
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:37.083
We can pay for Gabriela's party.

120
00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:39.000
We'll save the money.

121
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.791
Any kind of help is welcome
in these circumstances.

122
00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:46.458
We'd have the money
if you didn't spend it on liquor.

123
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.500
You need to accept your parents' help
because I was just fired.

124
00:13:56.083 --> 00:13:58.208
You'd better be kidding. Francisco.

125
00:13:58.291 --> 00:14:03.041
I'll find another job.
Meanwhile. accept your parents' help.

126
00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:05.708
I will not. Get a job.

127
00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:09.666
Even unemployed and broke
you've always got your booze.

128
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.291
Why don't you guys relax?
Relax and enjoy your dessert.

129
00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:15.708
And talk to us.

130
00:14:16.416 --> 00:14:17.958
It's okay. Pancho.

131
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Thank you.

132
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.208
So. tell me. How have you been?
How's it going?

133
00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:41.625
Mom.

134
00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:44.416
Gaby!

135
00:14:51.375 --> 00:14:55.666
VICEROYALTY OF NEW SPAIN - 1615

136
00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:12.458
How was your trip. sir?

137
00:15:12.541 --> 00:15:14.166
Very pleasant indeed.

138
00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.833
Although some native bandits
tried to steal our horses.

139
00:15:18.916 --> 00:15:20.583
But they were just hungry.

140
00:15:20.666 --> 00:15:22.666
We gave them food and water.

141
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.750
and they ended up protecting us
the rest of the way.

142
00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:28.666
I don't understand.

143
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:34.333
Why are the natives in these lands
so neglected?

144
00:15:35.666 --> 00:15:41.666
I know you want to continue
our viceroy's project. don't you. sir?

145
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.750
And we have made a huge effort

146
00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:47.500
to treat our natives
the best we can.

147
00:15:48.083 --> 00:15:49.333
It's just that...

148
00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:54.416
they're so many
we can't look after all of them. but...

149
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.666
we're doing our best.

150
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.458
Your employees
look more like slaves to me.

151
00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:06.041
I hope your Excellency likes
what we've prepared for you.

152
00:16:06.125 --> 00:16:09.666
And I hope it's not a huge feast
like the last time.

153
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.208
At this rate. I'll be as fat as your wife.

154
00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:16.625
Where is she?

155
00:16:16.708 --> 00:16:20.458
She's in Spain taking care of business.

156
00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:22.375
I wanted to say hello to her.

157
00:16:22.458 --> 00:16:24.833
Let's see what you've got for me.

158
00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:26.583
Go right ahead. sir.

159
00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:44.583
Ladies and gentlemen.

160
00:16:45.791 --> 00:16:52.166
Pay attention. this festival
promises to be most exciting.

161
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.833
because after watching our performance

162
00:16:55.916 --> 00:16:59.916
your viceroy
will want to jump off his box seat.

163
00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:06.958
To honor the arrival
of your beloved viceroy.

164
00:17:07.041 --> 00:17:11.083
we've organized a humble celebration.

165
00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:15.166
So humble it will last all night long!

166
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:22.166
I'd also like to take this opportunity
to thank your beloved host.

167
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:25.333
Squire Buenaventura De La Garza.

168
00:17:28.833 --> 00:17:30.500
And to keep you awake...

169
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:35.500
we begin with acts that defy all logic.

170
00:17:36.083 --> 00:17:41.250
And men who are brave enough
to face death.

171
00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:46.833
and achieve the feat
known as the final leap.

172
00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:51.833
will receive from your viceroy's emissary

173
00:17:51.916 --> 00:17:54.916
one hundred coins!

174
00:18:00.416 --> 00:18:04.666
Here is your first participant.

175
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.750
María.

176
00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:28.291
Think about it.

177
00:18:30.291 --> 00:18:34.708
I'll be expecting your reply
before I sail for Spain.

178
00:18:36.166 --> 00:18:38.708
I know you don't want to go back. and...

179
00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:42.208
I respect your decision.

180
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.250
but I cannot stay here.

181
00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:49.333
My home is in Spain.

182
00:18:51.666 --> 00:18:53.041
Don't worry. Father.

183
00:18:55.458 --> 00:18:57.666
I understand perfectly well.

184
00:19:03.583 --> 00:19:04.791
I will be alright.

185
00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:10.416
And remember to write
when you arrive in Spain.

186
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:12.625
I love you.

187
00:19:13.916 --> 00:19:15.916
Don't you ever forget it.

188
00:19:37.458 --> 00:19:39.291
I need you to come with us.

189
00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:49.875
Come on!

190
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.416
I guess you're next.

191
00:19:58.916 --> 00:20:02.583
My famous friend.
I like seeing you alive.

192
00:20:02.666 --> 00:20:05.833
Same here. I thought you were dead.

193
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.250
I thought you gave up games
that defy Lady Luck.

194
00:20:10.333 --> 00:20:11.583
I did give them up.

195
00:20:12.666 --> 00:20:14.333
But they won't give me up.

196
00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:19.916
Why don't we make this
a little more exciting?

197
00:20:20.916 --> 00:20:22.916
Sure. What are you up to?

198
00:20:23.916 --> 00:20:28.000
I bet you 100 coins

199
00:20:28.083 --> 00:20:31.833
that you won't dare be next.

200
00:20:31.916 --> 00:20:35.166
One hundred coins!
That's very brave of you.

201
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:40.750
I bet you only ten

202
00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:44.791
that you won't dare to try it after me.

203
00:20:46.416 --> 00:20:47.541
-Well?
-It's a deal.

204
00:20:47.791 --> 00:20:48.916
Yes!

205
00:20:56.208 --> 00:20:57.208
Damn!

206
00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:02.833
It's my turn.

207
00:21:08.208 --> 00:21:09.875
So?

208
00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:14.208
Does any other spectator
dare to face death?

209
00:21:18.541 --> 00:21:22.166
We have our next participant!

210
00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:29.416
How long?

211
00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:31.666
Too long.

212
00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:34.208
Go on!

213
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.750
I need my money.

214
00:21:43.708 --> 00:21:47.291
I also heard you're traveling
to Veracruz tomorrow.

215
00:21:47.833 --> 00:21:51.166
-Weren't you going to tell me?
-I was going to.

216
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.000
Julio. Julio!

217
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:57.500
I won't fall for your tricks this time.
I know you too well.

218
00:21:57.583 --> 00:22:00.541
I swear it wasn't my fault this time.

219
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.666
I promise to pay you everything I owe you.

220
00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:06.958
You've run out of luck.

221
00:22:07.833 --> 00:22:10.500
You can't pay me. can you?

222
00:22:12.333 --> 00:22:17.291
You worked for me for many years.
I gave you some good land.

223
00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:18.875
I appreciate that.

224
00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:21.750
But as I always told you:

225
00:22:21.833 --> 00:22:27.041
"Those who don't use their land
end up losing."

226
00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:36.333
My daughter? Not my daughter!

227
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.458
Don't hurt her. please! I beg you!

228
00:22:42.916 --> 00:22:44.541
Bring me that one.

229
00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:45.750
It's okay. Justino.

230
00:22:47.125 --> 00:22:49.125
Luck is always on our side.

231
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:53.541
Let's do this. handsome.

232
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.750
A promise is a promise.

233
00:23:30.583 --> 00:23:33.583
We have a winner!

234
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.708
A hundred coins makes life easy for you.

235
00:23:45.916 --> 00:23:48.458
Justino will feast like a king.

236
00:23:50.583 --> 00:23:53.166
So. what are you waiting for?

237
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.500
The horse won't saddle itself.

238
00:23:56.916 --> 00:23:58.083
Some other day.

239
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.750
No.

240
00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:05.125
What a negative attitude.

241
00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:22.208
I'll be right back.

242
00:24:27.541 --> 00:24:29.583
Excuse me. You look familiar.

243
00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:40.291
You look familiar.

244
00:24:42.166 --> 00:24:44.166
You say that to all women.

245
00:24:46.166 --> 00:24:47.750
Tell me something.

246
00:24:49.291 --> 00:24:51.375
How many fell for your tricks?

247
00:24:51.458 --> 00:24:54.833
It worked for more than half the women
I've tried it with.

248
00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.458
But...

249
00:24:58.375 --> 00:25:00.458
I mean it this time.

250
00:25:02.333 --> 00:25:03.916
You look familiar.

251
00:25:06.708 --> 00:25:07.833
Don't you remember me?

252
00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:11.958
From Veracruz?

253
00:25:19.583 --> 00:25:21.166
Are you...

254
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.250
that tightrope walker kid?

255
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:30.333
Who made a few coins on the jetty
by walking on a rope?

256
00:25:33.125 --> 00:25:35.541
-You're nothing like him.
-Really?

257
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.500
That was ages ago.

258
00:25:40.416 --> 00:25:41.416
That's true.

259
00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:47.625
If only coins were as durable as scars.

260
00:25:48.833 --> 00:25:49.833
I'd be different.

261
00:25:56.083 --> 00:25:58.083
How is your father?

262
00:25:58.875 --> 00:26:00.333
He's here today.

263
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Although

264
00:26:05.458 --> 00:26:07.458
he doesn't seem to like it here.

265
00:26:09.458 --> 00:26:11.666
Do you like it here?

266
00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:14.375
-I'm better off here than in Spain.
-Good.

267
00:26:15.833 --> 00:26:16.916
I have no complaints.

268
00:26:19.333 --> 00:26:22.333
And you? Do you like the New World?

269
00:26:24.958 --> 00:26:25.958
Yes.

270
00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:28.291
Very much.

271
00:26:31.208 --> 00:26:33.208
I have no complaints either.

272
00:26:34.083 --> 00:26:38.083
I have been very blessed here

273
00:26:40.083 --> 00:26:42.833
and going back to Spain would be madness

274
00:26:42.916 --> 00:26:45.333
because I have no friends
or family over there.

275
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.916
But I have my horse. Justino.

276
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.250
my good luck and a lousy map
that always makes me lose my way.

277
00:26:58.333 --> 00:27:00.916
-It's funny.
-What?

278
00:27:02.666 --> 00:27:07.333
For someone who brags about his good luck
to get lost so much.

279
00:27:10.791 --> 00:27:13.458
That doesn't say much
about your good luck. does it?

280
00:27:13.541 --> 00:27:14.625
Well...

281
00:27:15.916 --> 00:27:18.333
I guess you're right.

282
00:27:19.083 --> 00:27:23.666
But I've always believed

283
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:28.250
it all depends
on where you end up getting lost.

284
00:27:28.333 --> 00:27:30.083
Don't you agree?

285
00:27:31.666 --> 00:27:35.625
Speaking about good luck.
would you like to...

286
00:27:35.833 --> 00:27:37.958
Your father needs you. Come with us.

287
00:27:50.791 --> 00:27:53.833
Sometimes the pain isn't enough. right?

288
00:27:55.166 --> 00:27:56.166
Come on.

289
00:27:56.666 --> 00:27:57.666
Come on.

290
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.583
I have a question for you.

291
00:28:01.791 --> 00:28:02.791
Go ahead.

292
00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:06.666
Have you worked for that squire?

293
00:28:07.583 --> 00:28:09.416
Yes. Why?

294
00:28:10.958 --> 00:28:12.458
What's that woman to him?

295
00:28:13.666 --> 00:28:15.041
I don't know.

296
00:28:15.166 --> 00:28:18.333
All I know is. her father owes the squire
some money.

297
00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:23.333
Thanks.

298
00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:27.333
Excuse me.

299
00:28:29.083 --> 00:28:33.166
-I need to speak with you.
-Tell me. What brings you here?

300
00:28:33.291 --> 00:28:34.666
Business.

301
00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:40.791
A poor devil like you?

302
00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:43.041
What can you possibly offer me?

303
00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:51.000
I offer you 150 coins for that man's debt.

304
00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:55.750
That man's debt has been paid.

305
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.416
So. get out of my sight.

306
00:29:03.916 --> 00:29:05.166
You won't see me again.

307
00:29:09.166 --> 00:29:10.166
Making friends?

308
00:29:17.583 --> 00:29:18.666
I need a favor.

309
00:29:20.916 --> 00:29:22.416
No. man.

310
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.750
I'm not going back to jail
because of you.

311
00:29:24.833 --> 00:29:25.916
Well.

312
00:29:26.625 --> 00:29:28.625
if you made some friends there.

313
00:29:29.833 --> 00:29:30.833
you're welcome.

314
00:29:32.958 --> 00:29:35.125
You still haven't convinced me.

315
00:29:37.333 --> 00:29:39.250
I'll convince you on the road.

316
00:29:54.583 --> 00:29:57.166
I'll be with Buenaventura.
if you fall asleep again.

317
00:29:57.833 --> 00:29:59.083
I'll have your heads.

318
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:20.541
It's here.

319
00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:26.833
What are you doing?

320
00:30:27.416 --> 00:30:31.750
-In Andalusia you need to watch...
-We need to watch our backs.

321
00:30:31.833 --> 00:30:32.833
Okay.

322
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:36.791
You should too. if you're smart.

323
00:30:40.166 --> 00:30:42.833
Stay with the horses. I'll be right back.

324
00:30:45.333 --> 00:30:46.333
Hey.

325
00:30:47.208 --> 00:30:49.541
I'm the one that knows the estate.

326
00:30:51.291 --> 00:30:53.541
And I'm stealthier than you.

327
00:30:53.625 --> 00:30:55.375
And I know where he has the gold.

328
00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:58.125
I'm more experienced.

329
00:31:01.625 --> 00:31:03.208
Let's do this.

330
00:31:03.875 --> 00:31:07.375
-I bet you ten coins.
-No way.

331
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.916
I've had enough dares for today.
Go by yourself.

332
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.125
Old age is getting to you.

333
00:32:47.791 --> 00:32:50.875
So. now you steal women?
I didn't see that coming.

334
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.166
I stole nothing. I borrowed her
and plan to return her.

335
00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.958
This one never returns what he borrows.

336
00:32:58.333 --> 00:33:01.750
He means it's been a huge feat.

337
00:33:01.833 --> 00:33:02.833
Okay. Fine.

338
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:08.541
Why don't we just go?
You can chat on the way.

339
00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:09.625
Right?

340
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.208
Whoa! Whoa!

341
00:33:30.291 --> 00:33:34.750
My friend. I bid you farewell.
It's been a pleasure to help you.

342
00:33:34.833 --> 00:33:36.375
Okay. Diego.

343
00:33:36.458 --> 00:33:40.125
Thanks for your help.
I hope to see you soon.

344
00:33:40.208 --> 00:33:42.125
Not that soon. I hope.

345
00:33:42.208 --> 00:33:45.208
Miss. take good care of him.

346
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:47.500
Godspeed to both of you.

347
00:33:47.583 --> 00:33:48.916
Same to you.

348
00:33:49.833 --> 00:33:51.250
Giddy up!

349
00:34:01.166 --> 00:34:03.916
So. my old friend.

350
00:34:04.916 --> 00:34:06.750
Now that you're free.

351
00:34:07.541 --> 00:34:10.291
where will you go with your father?

352
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.375
No.

353
00:34:14.375 --> 00:34:17.875
I'll write my father
telling him not to worry about me.

354
00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:23.166
I think I've found my destiny here.

355
00:34:25.375 --> 00:34:26.708
I think so too.

356
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.708
So. where do you want to go. Miss?

357
00:34:35.416 --> 00:34:37.916
Let's go wherever fate takes us.

358
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.041
You'll see just how amazing fate can be.

359
00:35:05.083 --> 00:35:09.625
I think your daughter fainted
simply because she's weak.

360
00:35:10.291 --> 00:35:13.958
Probably due to malnutrition.

361
00:35:15.375 --> 00:35:17.791
She's fine for now. hypothetically.

362
00:35:17.875 --> 00:35:21.125
but she needs to be hospitalized
for one or two days

363
00:35:21.208 --> 00:35:23.291
until she's stable. okay?

364
00:35:30.166 --> 00:35:32.791
Is there something I can do to help?

365
00:35:32.875 --> 00:35:34.958
My son is very ill.

366
00:35:36.208 --> 00:35:37.666
And it's only getting worse.

367
00:35:38.458 --> 00:35:40.291
I'm so sorry. ma'am.

368
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.458
What's your son's name?

369
00:35:44.541 --> 00:35:46.291
Pedrito is my son's name.

370
00:35:47.083 --> 00:35:51.916
You wouldn't believe
what he's been through since he was three.

371
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:57.458
Watching him struggle with all of this...

372
00:36:00.125 --> 00:36:05.000
gives me the strength to keep going
stronger than ever.

373
00:36:05.583 --> 00:36:07.083
I'm here

374
00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:10.750
because my granddaughter
collapsed in my living room.

375
00:36:11.375 --> 00:36:13.625
Her nose was bleeding.

376
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.833
And I'm very concerned.

377
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.833
Kids. Our little ones.

378
00:36:21.916 --> 00:36:26.250
They're the ones who make us so strong.

379
00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:32.333
That's my daughter.
I'll see what's going on. ma'am.

380
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.833
This is your fault.

381
00:36:37.916 --> 00:36:40.791
If you were at home some more
the kid would be fine

382
00:36:40.875 --> 00:36:43.083
and none of this would be happening.

383
00:36:43.166 --> 00:36:44.916
So now it's my fault?

384
00:36:45.458 --> 00:36:49.625
You say it's all my fault?
At least I've got a job.

385
00:36:49.708 --> 00:36:51.875
You know things are tough.

386
00:36:51.958 --> 00:36:56.625
And about the money.
don't worry. there's more than enough.

387
00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:02.541
Don't lie to me. Pancho. I know you.
You just loaf around all day.

388
00:37:02.625 --> 00:37:05.500
How would you know?
You're never at home.

389
00:37:05.583 --> 00:37:08.416
-Just find a job or else...
-Or else what?

390
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.250
I'll move in with my folks.

391
00:37:10.791 --> 00:37:14.375
You have a kid. Pancho.
You're still acting as a child.

392
00:37:14.458 --> 00:37:16.541
-Look. just...
-Just what?

393
00:37:17.125 --> 00:37:19.708
Don't you dare be disrespectful to me.

394
00:37:53.166 --> 00:37:56.208
I have to go to work.

395
00:37:58.041 --> 00:38:01.875
Will you do everything the nurses say?

396
00:38:01.958 --> 00:38:04.416
Yes. Mom. I love you.

397
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.875
-I love you too.
-Bye. Mom.

398
00:38:21.291 --> 00:38:26.000
-You heard my mom. right?
-No.

399
00:38:26.833 --> 00:38:29.208
Don't worry. We hear everything here.

400
00:38:31.041 --> 00:38:32.625
What are you drawing?

401
00:38:33.583 --> 00:38:38.333
My quinceañera party dress. Take a look.

402
00:38:40.458 --> 00:38:43.666
-I like the design.
-I have other designs.

403
00:38:50.541 --> 00:38:54.416
-You shouldn't be here.
-Why not?

404
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:58.083
Look at you. You don't look sick.

405
00:38:58.166 --> 00:39:02.208
No offense meant.
but you might join the club soon.

406
00:39:02.875 --> 00:39:06.791
I just got here.
How long have you been here?

407
00:39:07.583 --> 00:39:10.791
Not long. but don't worry.

408
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:15.958
You get accustomed to everything
except the food.

409
00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:17.791
What do you suggest?

410
00:39:18.291 --> 00:39:21.333
Beans and eggs. Their specialty.

411
00:39:21.416 --> 00:39:25.958
I mean being in hospitals.
How can you stand it?

412
00:39:26.041 --> 00:39:29.541
If it helps any.
imagine you're somewhere else.

413
00:39:29.625 --> 00:39:32.500
Wherever you want to be.
That works sometimes.

414
00:39:34.041 --> 00:39:38.250
-Do you believe in God?
-The answer is obvious.

415
00:39:38.833 --> 00:39:41.625
Me too. but in a different way.

416
00:39:41.708 --> 00:39:43.500
What do you mean?

417
00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:47.708
That sometimes God sends us to this world
to test us

418
00:39:47.791 --> 00:39:51.666
and if we pass the test.
he sends another and another.

419
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.000
And so forth. in order to heal us.

420
00:39:54.083 --> 00:39:58.416
Sure. to make us stronger.
You sound like my grandpa.

421
00:40:14.791 --> 00:40:17.708
Raúl. Pour me one. please.

422
00:40:18.208 --> 00:40:20.666
-Want a tab?
-Yes.

423
00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:37.208
How are you doing. buddy?

424
00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:38.875
Okay.

425
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.291
Hanging in there.

426
00:40:41.375 --> 00:40:43.291
But you'll have one with me. right?

427
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.708
I don't want to drink too much.

428
00:40:47.291 --> 00:40:49.208
One is like none.

429
00:40:50.416 --> 00:40:52.791
What? Does your wife beat you up?

430
00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:01.625
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

431
00:41:03.708 --> 00:41:06.625
I'd like to stay with you. but...

432
00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:09.500
-I can't.
-Why not?

433
00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:11.291
I have to work.

434
00:41:13.125 --> 00:41:14.500
And...

435
00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:20.875
I'd like to stay here with you. but...

436
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.291
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

437
00:41:26.708 --> 00:41:30.375
You'll see.
we'll be able to go to the beach.

438
00:41:30.458 --> 00:41:34.708
You'll be just fine.
We'll be very happy there.

439
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.500
You can go running.

440
00:41:39.458 --> 00:41:40.916
and then...

441
00:42:20.375 --> 00:42:21.916
Grandma.

442
00:42:22.541 --> 00:42:26.875
My Gaby is awake!
How are you feeling. baby?

443
00:42:26.958 --> 00:42:30.375
-Better than yesterday.
-That's great. honey.

444
00:42:30.958 --> 00:42:35.208
That's Our Lady of San Juan.

445
00:42:35.291 --> 00:42:39.250
She has interceded for thousands of people
and healed many others.

446
00:42:39.333 --> 00:42:43.958
But you need to pray to her
with a lot of faith.

447
00:42:44.916 --> 00:42:47.333
And you'll see how she'll help you too.

448
00:42:49.125 --> 00:42:50.791
Let's pray to her. okay?

449
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:56.500
In the name of the Father. and of the Son.
and of the Holy Ghost. amen.

450
00:42:57.208 --> 00:43:00.750
Our Father who art in Heaven
hallowed be Thy name.

451
00:43:15.416 --> 00:43:16.500
Yes?

452
00:43:16.583 --> 00:43:20.458
-Is the manager in?
-What do you need him for?

453
00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:24.666
-To hand him my job application.
-I'll take care of it.

454
00:43:27.708 --> 00:43:29.208
Thanks.

455
00:43:36.791 --> 00:43:40.083
-How's it going. Mom?
-Everything's fine. honey.

456
00:43:42.916 --> 00:43:44.625
Hi. Gaby.

457
00:43:45.458 --> 00:43:47.541
-How are you?
-I'm okay. Mom.

458
00:43:48.458 --> 00:43:49.958
What are you doing?

459
00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:52.708
Is this us?

460
00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:55.000
Yes. next to the Blessed Virgin.

461
00:43:55.583 --> 00:43:58.041
I'll take it with me
when it's done. honey.

462
00:43:59.625 --> 00:44:01.666
Mom.

463
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:06.666
-Where did you get this picture?
-A nurse found it on the floor.

464
00:44:07.208 --> 00:44:10.958
Mom. do you like the altar Grandpa made?

465
00:44:11.041 --> 00:44:14.250
Yes. Gaby. it's very nice.
The Blessed Virgin will protect you.

466
00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:20.958
Mom. Hasn't Pancho come back?

467
00:44:41.333 --> 00:44:45.708
TEYAHUALCO CLINIC

468
00:45:16.416 --> 00:45:17.750
What happened?

469
00:45:22.083 --> 00:45:24.291
It's not just malnutrition. apparently.

470
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.208
They're running some more tests.

471
00:45:27.958 --> 00:45:30.166
I had to stay in the hospital all alone.

472
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.750
Calm down.
Wait and see what the doctors say.

473
00:45:32.833 --> 00:45:34.000
What about Pancho?

474
00:45:34.083 --> 00:45:36.041
He never listens to me.

475
00:45:36.125 --> 00:45:37.541
Look.

476
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:43.250
It's a workshop the church organizes.
Give it to him.

477
00:45:44.458 --> 00:45:47.708
Ramón was here a while ago.

478
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:51.416
He didn't believe
you were in the restroom.

479
00:45:55.833 --> 00:45:57.375
This can't be happening.

480
00:45:58.125 --> 00:45:59.750
It's one thing after another.

481
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.166
Aren't you ladies talking too much?

482
00:46:05.333 --> 00:46:07.708
Looks like somebody's alarm clock
didn't work.

483
00:46:07.791 --> 00:46:11.916
Ramón. Carmen's kid is in hospital
with a serious condition.

484
00:46:14.416 --> 00:46:16.583
I hope she gets better soon.

485
00:46:16.666 --> 00:46:19.708
but I also hope
it's the last time you're late.

486
00:46:19.791 --> 00:46:21.750
You're making it very hard for me.

487
00:46:21.833 --> 00:46:26.166
I know your kid is ill.
but the supervisors are pressuring me.

488
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.958
I told them you're one of our best. but...

489
00:46:29.041 --> 00:46:32.125
It won't happen again. I'm sorry. Ramón.

490
00:46:32.208 --> 00:46:34.166
I hope so. Carmen.

491
00:46:38.458 --> 00:46:40.541
-Ceci.
-Yes?

492
00:46:40.625 --> 00:46:43.375
Can you take me to the hospital
after work?

493
00:46:43.458 --> 00:46:47.041
Sure. I'll see how Gabrielita's doing.

494
00:46:52.125 --> 00:46:57.083
And the old lady says.
"No. he's too ugly and thick-lipped."

495
00:46:58.041 --> 00:46:59.041
I'm here.

496
00:46:59.541 --> 00:47:01.375
-Hi.
-Hi.

497
00:47:01.458 --> 00:47:02.541
Hi.

498
00:47:03.125 --> 00:47:04.000
-Hi.
-Mom.

499
00:47:04.083 --> 00:47:05.875
-Hi. honey.
-Hi. Gaby.

500
00:47:05.958 --> 00:47:07.666
How are you feeling?

501
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:11.208
Fine. Mom.
Grandpa Gerónimo came to see me.

502
00:47:11.291 --> 00:47:13.250
I glad to hear you're feeling better.

503
00:47:13.333 --> 00:47:16.333
You guys can go home. Dad.
Thanks for helping with Gaby.

504
00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:18.416
Your dad and I need to speak with you.

505
00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:22.083
-Is it urgent. Mom?
-Let's go outside. honey.

506
00:47:22.166 --> 00:47:24.625
Your dad. Mariela and I
are going on a pilgrimage

507
00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:27.125
to Our Lady of San Juan de Los Lagos.

508
00:47:27.208 --> 00:47:31.458
Mom. you scared me. But why now?

509
00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:34.750
I don't know where Pancho is.
I need your support.

510
00:47:34.833 --> 00:47:38.458
Honey. we're always there for you.
but this time.

511
00:47:38.541 --> 00:47:42.416
we want to go and pray for Gaby
and our family.

512
00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:46.708
Carmen. we need to have a lot of faith
right now.

513
00:47:46.791 --> 00:47:51.708
I know the Blessed Virgin
will do a miracle for our Gaby.

514
00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:54.833
We need to be together
more than ever now.

515
00:47:54.916 --> 00:47:56.708
Pancho never showed up.

516
00:47:57.666 --> 00:48:01.000
I'm getting tired of that man.
if he keeps this up...

517
00:48:01.083 --> 00:48:04.541
Calm down. honey. please.
Everything will be just fine.

518
00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:06.416
Everything will be just fine.

519
00:48:07.416 --> 00:48:08.750
I understand.

520
00:48:09.791 --> 00:48:11.750
Go if you have to.

521
00:48:11.833 --> 00:48:16.041
If you think that can help Gabriela.
go right ahead.

522
00:48:16.125 --> 00:48:18.708
It's just a few days
and everything will be okay.

523
00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:20.750
We will pray for our Gaby.

524
00:48:21.541 --> 00:48:25.625
Meanwhile you and Pancho
take good care of her. Okay. honey?

525
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.833
Yes. Mom. Go pray for our family.

526
00:48:28.916 --> 00:48:32.125
We'll say goodbye to Gaby. Okay. honey?

527
00:48:35.375 --> 00:48:37.916
-I love you very much. honey.
-I love you too.

528
00:48:40.625 --> 00:48:43.916
It's beautiful. honey!

529
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
This is lovely. honey.

530
00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:49.375
Honey.

531
00:48:49.458 --> 00:48:52.500
We're going to San Juan de los Lagos
for a few days

532
00:48:52.583 --> 00:48:55.541
to pray to the Blessed Virgin for you.

533
00:48:55.625 --> 00:48:57.208
We'll be back soon.

534
00:48:57.291 --> 00:48:59.208
Just remember.

535
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:05.000
be good and do whatever the doctors say.

536
00:49:05.916 --> 00:49:07.750
Bring me something from San Juan.

537
00:49:07.833 --> 00:49:10.416
-Of course. honey.
-Of course.

538
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:14.416
-We love you very much.
-I love you too.

539
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:15.875
My princess.

540
00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:23.291
What's up. Raúl?

541
00:49:23.958 --> 00:49:25.875
I came to pay my tab.

542
00:49:25.958 --> 00:49:27.166
Sure.

543
00:49:29.708 --> 00:49:33.083
One for the road. José? We'll miss you.

544
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:36.875
I don't think so.
We can see each other at Mass.

545
00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:39.541
Bartender.

546
00:49:40.375 --> 00:49:41.958
Pour me another.

547
00:49:44.916 --> 00:49:47.041
To toast to this unfair life.

548
00:49:49.916 --> 00:49:51.958
I'm losing the best thing I have.

549
00:49:53.291 --> 00:49:55.916
It's the first time
I hear you talk like that.

550
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.083
We all know
what your family is going through.

551
00:49:59.166 --> 00:50:00.666
What do you know how I feel?

552
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.875
It's unbearable pain.

553
00:50:04.958 --> 00:50:07.875
Maybe I don't know
what you're going through. but...

554
00:50:07.958 --> 00:50:11.041
I know this is no place
to find a solution.

555
00:50:11.125 --> 00:50:13.125
Who are you to judge me?

556
00:50:15.375 --> 00:50:17.125
You have your family.

557
00:50:18.125 --> 00:50:19.833
Why aren't you with them?

558
00:50:20.791 --> 00:50:22.041
I know that.

559
00:50:24.291 --> 00:50:26.500
But sometimes there's nothing you can do.

560
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.375
Raúl.

561
00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:32.250
Give him the free tequila shot instead.

562
00:50:32.333 --> 00:50:35.958
He needs it more than me.
Maybe it's his last drink.

563
00:50:38.916 --> 00:50:41.041
Leave me alone.

564
00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:47.958
He doesn't mean any harm.
His son just died.

565
00:50:48.041 --> 00:50:50.250
He's having a hard time.

566
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:10.500
Tell Brandon to help him.
He helped a lot of people in his workshop.

567
00:51:10.583 --> 00:51:12.041
I'll tell him.

568
00:51:12.875 --> 00:51:15.666
Thanks. Ceci. What would I do without you?

569
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.166
You're welcome. I'm always there for you.

570
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:22.291
Hi. princess.

571
00:51:23.958 --> 00:51:27.291
-Where were you?
-Job hunting.

572
00:51:28.166 --> 00:51:31.166
-Pancho. we need to talk.
-But I haven't found anything.

573
00:51:31.958 --> 00:51:34.416
-I don't want you lacking anything.
-Pancho.

574
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:38.958
I'll be right back.

575
00:51:44.583 --> 00:51:47.416
Give me Gaby's picture
you took from my wallet.

576
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:48.875
What picture?

577
00:51:48.958 --> 00:51:52.083
I looked for you all day long.
Where were you?

578
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:55.083
Carmen. I've been looking for work
all day.

579
00:51:55.166 --> 00:51:56.916
How do I know that?

580
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.166
You know how many factories
I went to today?

581
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:04.750
I'm trying to believe you. Pancho.
But I can't.

582
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:06.750
You're right.

583
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:11.791
I just ask one thing of you. Trust me.

584
00:52:14.125 --> 00:52:17.250
And regarding Gaby's expenses.
don't worry about them.

585
00:52:17.333 --> 00:52:19.625
The doctors don't know
what's wrong with her.

586
00:52:19.708 --> 00:52:22.375
They're running more tests.

587
00:52:22.458 --> 00:52:27.458
Your daughter needs you.
Do not let her down.

588
00:52:35.375 --> 00:52:38.166
-Good morning. everyone.
-Good morning.

589
00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:40.791
Welcome to this new pilgrimage.

590
00:52:40.875 --> 00:52:43.833
I need you to know this is no field day.

591
00:52:43.916 --> 00:52:48.083
It's a very long day
to our Lady of San Juan's shrine.

592
00:52:48.166 --> 00:52:50.708
We'll thank her for her benevolence

593
00:52:50.791 --> 00:52:54.625
and ask her to be at our side
in our times of need.

594
00:52:55.291 --> 00:53:00.250
Remember that each challenge
is a test from God.

595
00:53:00.916 --> 00:53:02.916
This will make us very strong

596
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.916
for our trip
and whatever we have to deal with.

597
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.291
The rest is up to us.

598
00:53:08.375 --> 00:53:10.583
All that matters
is getting there together.

599
00:53:10.666 --> 00:53:15.208
Remember that fear and faith
are incompatible.

600
00:53:15.291 --> 00:53:18.208
You're only scared if you lack faith.

601
00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:21.750
So the last to get there buys the tamales.

602
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:23.666
Yes.

603
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:28.333
Get bottled water. check your bicycles.
and see you in ten minutes.

604
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.250
Let's go.

605
00:53:34.458 --> 00:53:36.416
Hurrah for our Lady of San Juan!

606
00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.708
Hurrah!

607
00:53:45.333 --> 00:53:46.916
Who brought it for you?

608
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.083
-My granddad.
-How sweet of him.

609
00:53:51.125 --> 00:53:54.375
My parents did that pilgrimage
for many years.

610
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:59.583
They say it's an experience...
I can't even describe it.

611
00:53:59.666 --> 00:54:01.125
It's so beautiful.

612
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.916
I've never been on a pilgrimage.

613
00:54:04.916 --> 00:54:06.791
Because of my job.

614
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:11.166
But I'd love to be there.

615
00:54:11.833 --> 00:54:14.458
-Good morning. Rosalba.
-Good morning.

616
00:54:14.958 --> 00:54:19.625
Gaby. what do you want me
to tell the folks outside?

617
00:54:19.708 --> 00:54:21.041
What folks?

618
00:54:26.625 --> 00:54:30.083
Your friends miss you.
They came to see how you're doing.

619
00:54:41.083 --> 00:54:43.666
Carmen. come with me.

620
00:54:47.166 --> 00:54:48.666
Don't you understand?

621
00:54:49.541 --> 00:54:51.666
My kid is hospitalized.

622
00:54:52.208 --> 00:54:54.416
I can't even afford her medication.

623
00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:57.250
I need my job.

624
00:54:59.041 --> 00:55:00.791
I need your signature.

625
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.166
What's wrong?

626
00:55:21.041 --> 00:55:22.041
What's wrong?

627
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.375
Oh no!

628
00:55:40.041 --> 00:55:41.208
Good morning. sir.

629
00:55:41.291 --> 00:55:44.500
-Can I help you?
-The manager?

630
00:55:44.583 --> 00:55:46.958
I'm the owner. How can I help you?

631
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:50.000
I'm looking for work.
Are there any positions available?

632
00:55:50.083 --> 00:55:52.291
We're not hiring at the moment.

633
00:55:52.375 --> 00:55:56.083
But you can give your application
to the secretary

634
00:55:56.166 --> 00:55:58.625
and we'll let you know when we're hiring.

635
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:05.833
I'll do anything.

636
00:56:19.791 --> 00:56:21.041
Okay. guys.

637
00:56:21.916 --> 00:56:24.083
We have a more precise diagnosis.

638
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.208
From the tests we ran on Gabriela.

639
00:56:29.916 --> 00:56:32.708
she has a rare condition.

640
00:56:32.791 --> 00:56:37.708
We think your daughter's condition
is a rare mutation of her heart valves.

641
00:56:40.458 --> 00:56:42.666
The right side is the most affected.

642
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:45.916
It pumps blood to the lungs.

643
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.833
so insufficient oxygen
is being pumped to the blood.

644
00:56:50.666 --> 00:56:54.500
We don't know for sure
how she'll respond to treatment.

645
00:56:54.583 --> 00:56:57.416
since there's no known cure
for the disease.

646
00:57:00.833 --> 00:57:03.500
Carmen. Are you listening?

647
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:06.375
Carmen.

648
00:57:06.458 --> 00:57:10.166
I need to know if you agree
to transferring her to Mexico City

649
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:13.125
for better medical attention
and a more precise diagnosis.

650
00:57:13.208 --> 00:57:17.000
We're not in a good situation
at the moment. Doctor.

651
00:57:18.541 --> 00:57:20.791
So that's difficult for now.

652
00:57:22.666 --> 00:57:23.791
I see.

653
00:57:23.875 --> 00:57:27.250
If it's about money.
I suggest you ask a relative for help.

654
00:57:27.333 --> 00:57:29.333
or get a bank to finance it.

655
00:57:37.416 --> 00:57:42.083
CHRIST INVITES YOU TO IMPROVE YOUR LIFE
PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOP

656
00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:07.416
I'm fine.

657
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.291
Pass me a bottle of water.
please. my child.

658
00:58:10.375 --> 00:58:11.833
Sure.

659
00:58:11.916 --> 00:58:13.250
-Thank you.
-Sure.

660
00:58:15.041 --> 00:58:16.125
Thanks.

661
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.166
Are you okay. Mom? Where does it hurt?

662
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:28.041
My feet and my legs.
But I'll be fine after I get some rest.

663
00:58:28.583 --> 00:58:29.750
Everything okay?

664
00:58:29.833 --> 00:58:34.375
Yes. son. We're a little tired.
but happy to see our blessed Virgin.

665
00:58:34.458 --> 00:58:36.583
-First time?
-Is it that obvious?

666
00:58:36.666 --> 00:58:38.291
That's normal. Don't worry.

667
00:58:38.375 --> 00:58:41.833
I can get you some transportation
if you like.

668
00:58:41.916 --> 00:58:46.583
Thanks. son. a few minutes rest
and we'll be fine. thank you.

669
00:58:46.666 --> 00:58:48.000
Let me know what you need.

670
00:58:48.083 --> 00:58:50.041
-How kind of you.
-Thanks.

671
00:58:52.375 --> 00:58:53.875
How are you feeling?

672
00:58:54.666 --> 00:58:56.125
Hi. sis.

673
00:59:01.875 --> 00:59:03.166
What? When?

674
00:59:09.791 --> 00:59:10.750
What is it. honey?

675
00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:35.791
Don't worry. honey.
We need to have a lot of faith.

676
00:59:35.875 --> 00:59:40.000
The Virgin Mary will heal Gaby.
You'll see.

677
00:59:42.916 --> 00:59:46.500
Sorry to intrude.
but I couldn't help hearing what you said.

678
00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:48.125
Is it a sick relative?

679
00:59:48.708 --> 00:59:51.625
Yes. my niece is getting worse.

680
00:59:52.125 --> 00:59:56.125
I lost my brother five years ago.

681
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:58.250
He died of cancer.

682
00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:02.875
Since then. I've done the pilgrimage
to thank God and the Virgin Mary

683
01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:06.875
for letting my brother live longer
than what the doctors predicted.

684
01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:13.208
Thank them for letting me speak with him.
laugh with him and say goodbye.

685
01:00:13.291 --> 01:00:17.833
This is how I say thank you.
It's my fourth pilgrimage.

686
01:00:17.916 --> 01:00:20.500
You guys are going to pray for her.
Aren't you?

687
01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:23.041
With all our hearts. son.

688
01:00:23.125 --> 01:00:26.791
My husband and I are very devoted
to Our Lady of San Juan.

689
01:00:26.875 --> 01:00:29.166
Have you heard of her first miracle?

690
01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:30.458
No.

691
01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:32.791
Why don't I tell you on the way?

692
01:00:32.875 --> 01:00:37.291
-Sure.
-Let's do that. Let's go. guys!

693
01:00:38.416 --> 01:00:40.750
It happened precisely

694
01:00:40.833 --> 01:00:44.166
in the town we're going to.
San Juan de los Lagos.

695
01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:47.166
In the year 1623

696
01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:50.041
it was called
San Juan Bautista de Mezquititlán.

697
01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:54.125
There was a very humble shrine
in the village.

698
01:00:54.208 --> 01:00:59.833
Ana Lucía and Pedro Andrés took care of it
and of Our Lady of San Juan.

699
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.208
Look at you.

700
01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.083
My beloved princess.

701
01:01:12.708 --> 01:01:18.208
What are you doing here on the altar?

702
01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:22.291
Yesterday you were in the sacristy.

703
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.916
Explain that to me.

704
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.125
Back to your niche you go.

705
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:41.875
I'm putting you back in here.

706
01:01:41.958 --> 01:01:44.791
You'll be just fine here.

707
01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:07.666
Pedro Andrés!

708
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:12.166
I found our beloved princess
here on the altar again.

709
01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:14.291
Did you take her out?

710
01:02:14.916 --> 01:02:17.833
Only we can go in there.

711
01:02:25.958 --> 01:02:31.583
Ana Lucía and Pedro Andrés were
Our Lady of San Juan's custodians.

712
01:02:31.666 --> 01:02:33.916
What was the circus people's family like?

713
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.791
That's next.
But now I'm going to disappoint you.

714
01:02:38.875 --> 01:02:42.541
We'll get to our base. eat and continue.
Is that okay?

715
01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:45.791
-Okay.
-This way. This way. guys.

716
01:03:02.625 --> 01:03:05.875
-Hi. Raúl.
-Hi.

717
01:03:05.958 --> 01:03:08.583
Have you seen the guy
I argued with the other day?

718
01:03:08.666 --> 01:03:10.250
I haven't seen him in a while.

719
01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:15.250
-Do you know where I can find him?
-No.

720
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:22.041
-I came to pay my tab.
-Thanks.

721
01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:37.833
This one is on the house.

722
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:43.583
No.

723
01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:46.083
Thanks.

724
01:04:02.375 --> 01:04:04.125
How is everyone doing?

725
01:04:04.625 --> 01:04:08.666
-Just fine. son.
-Good. Have you eaten and rested?

726
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:10.166
-We're fine.
-Yes. Thank you.

727
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:14.916
I wanted to thank you
for all your support.

728
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.041
There's nothing to thank me for.
Just let me know what you need.

729
01:04:19.125 --> 01:04:23.833
Thanks. son. I remembered our chat
about the Virgin Mary's custodians.

730
01:04:23.916 --> 01:04:26.500
What did they have to do
with the first miracle?

731
01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:31.083
They had a lot to do with it.
I came to tell you the story.

732
01:04:31.166 --> 01:04:33.708
Precisely in that year. 1623.

733
01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:37.708
a family of acrobats from San Luis Potosí

734
01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.916
consisting of the parents
and two daughters

735
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.750
were traveling to Guadalajara

736
01:04:42.833 --> 01:04:46.000
and decided to stop over
at San Juan Bautista de Mezquititlán.

737
01:04:49.333 --> 01:04:52.208
-Good morning.
-Can I help you?

738
01:04:53.083 --> 01:04:55.708
Our family is traveling
from very distant lands.

739
01:04:57.166 --> 01:04:58.625
It's been a very rough trip.

740
01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:03.541
We're very tired. hungry and thirsty.

741
01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:07.750
We very humbly request

742
01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:10.541
your hospitality.

743
01:05:13.375 --> 01:05:14.541
We have two girls.

744
01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:21.958
We're just going through
on our way to Guadalajara.

745
01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:24.250
Okay. you can stay.

746
01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:28.000
But only three days.

747
01:05:28.083 --> 01:05:30.875
-That will do.
-Outside our village.

748
01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:34.250
Thank you very much.

749
01:05:44.416 --> 01:05:48.166
So you met in Veracruz?

750
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:50.333
Yes. a long time ago.

751
01:05:50.916 --> 01:05:52.541
Wonderful.

752
01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:59.083
Mrs. Lucía.
Why doesn't your husband say anything?

753
01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:01.958
Is he afraid of strangers?

754
01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.291
Watch your mouth!

755
01:06:04.375 --> 01:06:08.000
I won't lie to you.
He is afraid of strangers.

756
01:06:08.916 --> 01:06:13.750
Sorry for asking such a rude question.
Mrs. Lucía.

757
01:06:13.833 --> 01:06:15.416
Don't worry about it.

758
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:19.958
What do you want to be
when you grow up. little girl?

759
01:06:20.041 --> 01:06:25.583
I'm sure she'll be a great writer.
She loves it when I read stories to her.

760
01:06:25.666 --> 01:06:29.708
-I want to be like Dad.
-Really? Like your dad?

761
01:06:30.916 --> 01:06:32.416
And why?

762
01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:36.416
Because he's the strongest.
He killed a wolf all by himself.

763
01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.916
Dear God! He killed a wolf?

764
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:43.000
Did he kill the wolf
for causing your scars?

765
01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:48.041
No. this scar is from when my dad
taught me the death-defying walk.

766
01:06:48.125 --> 01:06:50.250
The death-defying walk?

767
01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:54.875
Sadly. the elder one
took more after her dad.

768
01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:58.458
And that scares me.

769
01:07:01.125 --> 01:07:04.958
-But your husband seems to be a good man.
-That he is.

770
01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:08.625
But sometimes he ignores the risks.

771
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:12.500
I worry that he might risk his life
or someone else.

772
01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:15.833
Dinner is delicious. Mrs. Lucía.

773
01:07:15.916 --> 01:07:18.958
We would be very pleased
to pay for your hospitality.

774
01:07:19.041 --> 01:07:20.666
There's no need to pay us.

775
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:22.500
Thank you so much. Mrs. Ana Lucía.

776
01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:24.666
-May God reward you.
-I insist.

777
01:07:26.416 --> 01:07:28.125
There must be something we can do.

778
01:07:29.666 --> 01:07:36.125
Well. my husband has a hard time
working the fields

779
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.416
and your husband is big and strong.

780
01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:46.625
He could work the fields with him
while you're here.

781
01:07:46.708 --> 01:07:49.041
Excellent idea.

782
01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:55.000
And I would love to help you out
with your daily chores.

783
01:07:55.083 --> 01:08:00.041
but I need to practice for a...

784
01:08:00.125 --> 01:08:02.333
A show we're doing in Guadalajara.

785
01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:05.166
This is no time for quackery. dear.

786
01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:07.375
What show?

787
01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:11.416
-You'll love it. ma'am. I promise.
-Not this time. please.

788
01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:15.416
If we may. and with all due respect.

789
01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:20.791
we'd love to perform for you. right. dear?

790
01:08:20.875 --> 01:08:24.625
But of course.
To thank you for your hospitality.

791
01:08:25.083 --> 01:08:27.250
We'd appreciate that.

792
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.416
But for now we need to rest.

793
01:08:32.583 --> 01:08:34.083
Good night.

794
01:08:34.166 --> 01:08:37.083
-Good night.
-Good night. baby girl.

795
01:08:37.166 --> 01:08:39.791
-Good night.
-Good night.

796
01:08:47.583 --> 01:08:51.250
Honey. why don't you go to bed
with your sister?

797
01:08:51.333 --> 01:08:57.208
-I'm not sleepy. Mom.
-It's your bedtime. honey. It's late.

798
01:08:57.291 --> 01:09:00.000
Little mermaid. like your mom says.
it's bedtime.

799
01:09:00.083 --> 01:09:01.166
Yes. Daddy.

800
01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:24.041
You thought I wouldn't notice?

801
01:09:25.833 --> 01:09:29.583
You use your rehearsals as an excuse
to avoid helping Pedro Andrés.

802
01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:35.833
Don't forget what our goal is now.

803
01:09:35.916 --> 01:09:38.416
Settling down
and making a living some other way.

804
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.000
You're a father. for God's sake.

805
01:09:51.333 --> 01:09:54.333
I know this is our livelihood.

806
01:09:54.416 --> 01:09:58.875
but it's time you got accustomed
to doing something else.

807
01:10:04.708 --> 01:10:07.541
You're helping Pedro Andrés. period.

808
01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:09.500
Sure.

809
01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.708
Fine. woman.

810
01:10:15.625 --> 01:10:19.125
I'll help Pedro Andrés tomorrow morning.

811
01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:29.125
But after I work out and warm up.
and that's okay.

812
01:10:29.875 --> 01:10:33.208
Go to bed then.
Tomorrow is a long day for you.

813
01:11:16.166 --> 01:11:17.833
Welcome. everyone.

814
01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:22.625
In appreciation of your hospitality

815
01:11:23.958 --> 01:11:26.833
we have a great show for you.

816
01:11:28.791 --> 01:11:29.916
I hope you enjoy it.

817
01:12:37.166 --> 01:12:40.416
-Want to give it a try?
-But Dad. with daggers below?

818
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.916
I won't say no if that's what you want.

819
01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:47.458
I know you can do it.
You're my daughter and I trust you.

820
01:12:47.541 --> 01:12:52.541
But Dad. if Mom sees me.
she'll be mad at us.

821
01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:56.583
It's okay. honey.
Your mom can overdo it sometimes.

822
01:12:56.666 --> 01:13:01.416
She'll be so happy
to see how good you are at it.

823
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.791
She'll love it.

824
01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:04.125
-Okay.
-Okay.

825
01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.250
Listen up. people!

826
01:13:11.208 --> 01:13:15.250
I give you my daughter's very first act!

827
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.583
And we're doing it
with the greatest feat of all.

828
01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:22.583
The death-defying walk!

829
01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:25.583
Pay attention!

830
01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:40.125
What's wrong with you?
How can you allow such a scene?

831
01:13:40.208 --> 01:13:42.875
-What's wrong?
-Get your daughter down here now!

832
01:13:43.625 --> 01:13:48.000
I forgot to tell you
your daughter's ready to join my show.

833
01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:49.500
It's okay. she'll be fine.

834
01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:52.166
Tell her to get off of there now!

835
01:13:52.916 --> 01:13:57.333
I need a trained companion.
You used to help me.

836
01:13:57.416 --> 01:14:00.166
And I still do. I'm here.

837
01:14:02.041 --> 01:14:05.875
But now they're what matters most.

838
01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:07.125
You're here?

839
01:14:07.208 --> 01:14:10.583
Like when you let me do my act alone
to look after the girls?

840
01:14:10.666 --> 01:14:13.416
I need a trained companion like her.

841
01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.416
And now that I have her.
you'd take her away?

842
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.541
My daughter

843
01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:25.833
doesn't deserve
to be part of your tacky shows.

844
01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:29.666
You're mistaken. woman.
And I'll prove it to you.

845
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.375
Calm down. woman. It's okay.

846
01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:35.208
Honey. get down here right now.

847
01:14:38.166 --> 01:14:40.250
Please listen to me!

848
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.291
Go. honey. go.

849
01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:36.000
Go. go. go.

850
01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:42.458
Come on. you can do it.

851
01:15:49.833 --> 01:15:51.250
What happened?

852
01:17:06.708 --> 01:17:08.958
That's exactly what happened.

853
01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:13.625
Excuse me. son. but...

854
01:17:14.708 --> 01:17:17.625
I can't help remembering my granddaughter.

855
01:17:28.375 --> 01:17:29.750
Thanks. son.

856
01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:38.500
The nightmare of Gaby
closing her eyes forever

857
01:17:39.583 --> 01:17:41.208
torments me.

858
01:17:45.916 --> 01:17:48.291
What if we can't pay the hospital?

859
01:17:49.583 --> 01:17:50.833
Have some tea.

860
01:17:53.958 --> 01:17:55.916
What if Pancho has a relapse?

861
01:17:56.833 --> 01:18:02.583
I understand your doubts.
but you cannot lose your faith.

862
01:18:04.541 --> 01:18:08.291
You need to hang in there
and be as strong as Gaby.

863
01:18:13.541 --> 01:18:15.208
I'd like to be stronger.

864
01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:18.208
You've always been strong
since the day we met.

865
01:18:19.625 --> 01:18:23.125
You must be strong. Promise me you will.

866
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.916
Promise me on our friendship.

867
01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:33.458
Thank you. Ceci.

868
01:18:59.291 --> 01:19:00.708
Good morning. princess.

869
01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:28.916
Why?

870
01:19:29.958 --> 01:19:31.458
You deserve it.

871
01:19:32.958 --> 01:19:34.583
You're doing well?

872
01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:37.166
I work hard.

873
01:19:38.666 --> 01:19:40.333
You hardly drink now. right?

874
01:19:42.416 --> 01:19:43.958
What makes you say that?

875
01:19:44.541 --> 01:19:46.958
Don't worry. I won't tell Mom.

876
01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:54.416
-Can I say something?
-Anything you want.

877
01:19:57.208 --> 01:19:58.500
I'm scared.

878
01:20:08.625 --> 01:20:12.125
How are you feeling. Gaby?
You don't feel any pain?

879
01:20:14.833 --> 01:20:19.333
-Ceci. can you stay with Gaby for a while?
-Sure. I'll look after her.

880
01:20:19.416 --> 01:20:21.916
I'll be right back.
I need to speak with your dad.

881
01:20:26.208 --> 01:20:28.166
-How are you. honey?
-HI.

882
01:20:30.208 --> 01:20:31.333
That's beautiful!

883
01:20:31.416 --> 01:20:34.416
Tell me you didn't use our savings
to buy those gifts.

884
01:20:34.916 --> 01:20:37.416
No. it's money I earned.

885
01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:42.333
You just found a job.
Tell me you didn't spend that money.

886
01:20:42.916 --> 01:20:44.041
What if I did?

887
01:20:45.625 --> 01:20:47.291
Don't you dare. Pancho.

888
01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:49.958
Why did you do that?

889
01:20:50.666 --> 01:20:53.541
She already loves you
no matter what you do.

890
01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:56.333
What if it's not about that?

891
01:20:58.416 --> 01:20:59.916
What do you mean?

892
01:21:00.916 --> 01:21:02.958
What if she leaves us today?

893
01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:07.083
How can you say that. Francisco?

894
01:21:07.166 --> 01:21:10.416
-What if she doesn't make it to 15?
-The party isn't important.

895
01:21:10.916 --> 01:21:13.708
What if any day now
she's not with us anymore?

896
01:21:15.333 --> 01:21:19.041
First we need to get the money
to take her to another clinic.

897
01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:23.375
We don't have the money.
or a surgeon for her. Carmen!

898
01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:32.750
-And you spent the money like a kid?
-I want her last days to be happy.

899
01:21:41.708 --> 01:21:42.750
Here.

900
01:21:45.541 --> 01:21:47.250
You might need it.

901
01:21:50.208 --> 01:21:51.708
Take good care of Gaby.

902
01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:55.500
Tell her I had to go.

903
01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:03.916
CHRIST INVITES YOU TO IMPROVE YOUR LIFE

904
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.458
PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOP

905
01:22:17.708 --> 01:22:19.166
Okay. Let's begin.

906
01:22:20.625 --> 01:22:23.041
I'm not here to judge you.

907
01:22:23.125 --> 01:22:26.291
let alone to make you feel guilty.

908
01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:30.791
I'm here to speak with you.

909
01:22:32.333 --> 01:22:36.916
So. who'll be the first to share with us?

910
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.291
Okay.

911
01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:42.041
Those of you we've already met...

912
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:47.291
know that I lost a son.

913
01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.208
For the newcomers.

914
01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:56.250
I'm José.

915
01:22:56.333 --> 01:22:58.666
I work with numbers.

916
01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:03.750
I think in numbers. I understand numbers.

917
01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:09.958
But lately. before I fall asleep.
I just stare at the roof

918
01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:15.833
haunted by all the times
I failed him as a dad.

919
01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:20.416
All the days I wasn't with him...

920
01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:24.708
are the same days I was sober.

921
01:23:29.833 --> 01:23:31.291
I just wish...

922
01:23:33.291 --> 01:23:39.875
he knew how much I regret being a bad dad.

923
01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:43.500
We're here for you. José.

924
01:23:43.625 --> 01:23:48.666
Thank you for sharing that with all of us.

925
01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:50.500
Thank you.

926
01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:55.250
Does anyone else wish to share something?

927
01:23:57.666 --> 01:23:59.000
How about you?

928
01:24:01.666 --> 01:24:03.625
Is there anything you'd like to share?

929
01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:07.625
No.

930
01:24:07.708 --> 01:24:09.416
No. some other time.

931
01:24:10.166 --> 01:24:12.166
Come on. man.
I don't think you came here

932
01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:14.416
just to sit there and listen to us.

933
01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:21.125
Letting it out will make you feel better.
Trust me.

934
01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:27.916
My name is Francisco.
You can call me Pancho.

935
01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:32.416
I'm 39.

936
01:24:35.666 --> 01:24:37.166
Married.

937
01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.291
And I have a great daughter.

938
01:24:41.916 --> 01:24:43.875
I used to be a barfly.

939
01:24:45.041 --> 01:24:49.125
I used to toast so much.
And while I said "cheers"...

940
01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:53.083
my kid was fighting for her life.

941
01:24:58.083 --> 01:24:59.708
I have no money.

942
01:25:03.083 --> 01:25:06.708
But I always find some to buy liquor.

943
01:25:11.166 --> 01:25:13.250
I'm trying to improve

944
01:25:14.916 --> 01:25:16.166
for my wife.

945
01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:18.291
for my daughter...

946
01:25:20.333 --> 01:25:21.375
and for myself.

947
01:25:23.916 --> 01:25:25.875
Good job. Pancho.

948
01:25:27.291 --> 01:25:29.333
You're a good man.

949
01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:31.166
Always be like that.

950
01:25:32.166 --> 01:25:33.291
Always.

951
01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:36.583
Thank you.

952
01:25:40.166 --> 01:25:41.750
Well done. Pancho.

953
01:25:41.833 --> 01:25:44.041
-Thanks.
-Thanks. José. and all of you.

954
01:25:44.125 --> 01:25:46.208
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

955
01:26:09.375 --> 01:26:14.125
Forgive me. Mrs. Benita.
I couldn't continue the other day.

956
01:26:14.208 --> 01:26:16.958
The most important part of the story
is missing.

957
01:26:17.083 --> 01:26:18.583
I'm sorry too. son.

958
01:26:18.666 --> 01:26:21.666
because your story
reminded me of my little girl.

959
01:26:58.666 --> 01:27:01.375
I'll get a priest

960
01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:04.333
to give her a Christian burial.

961
01:27:06.666 --> 01:27:11.083
The nearest priest
is in the town of Xalostotitlán.

962
01:27:11.166 --> 01:27:14.916
I'm taking Pedro Andrés
to make the arrangements.

963
01:27:29.416 --> 01:27:30.916
Look at my daughter.

964
01:27:36.708 --> 01:27:38.833
It looks like she's asleep.

965
01:27:40.041 --> 01:27:43.000
Ma'am. with your permission.

966
01:27:43.083 --> 01:27:47.916
I can place the Blessed Virgin
on your daughter's chest.

967
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.166
She's extremely miraculous.

968
01:27:56.916 --> 01:27:58.000
Okay.

969
01:28:01.416 --> 01:28:04.166
If our beloved princess would like to.

970
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:07.208
She has done so many miracles.

971
01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.416
Ma'am. come quickly.

972
01:29:05.916 --> 01:29:09.791
Come and take a look.

973
01:29:09.875 --> 01:29:15.291
Look. The girl is breathing.

974
01:29:15.375 --> 01:29:18.416
She's breathing.
Look at her little stomach.

975
01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:21.708
The child is breathing.
She performed the miracle!

976
01:29:22.416 --> 01:29:24.458
I'm going to tell the men.

977
01:29:25.083 --> 01:29:26.458
I'll be right back.

978
01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:45.125
Pedro Andrés! Sir! Come quickly!

979
01:30:23.666 --> 01:30:27.583
I knew it. I knew it.

980
01:30:28.166 --> 01:30:30.583
She did the miracle for us.

981
01:30:31.458 --> 01:30:36.083
Our beloved princess
performed the miracle for us.

982
01:30:36.166 --> 01:30:38.458
Most Holy Beloved Princess!

983
01:30:47.416 --> 01:30:49.875
Are you okay. honey?
Do you feel any pain?

984
01:30:49.958 --> 01:30:53.250
No. Mother.
Just a burning sensation in my chest.

985
01:30:59.375 --> 01:31:02.666
-This is a real miracle.
-Yes.

986
01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:16.083
From the parish of Xalostotitlán.

987
01:31:18.375 --> 01:31:22.875
Signer. parish priest Diego de Herrera.

988
01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:29.083
Year 1623.

989
01:31:31.458 --> 01:31:34.250
Send it to Guadalajara at once.

990
01:31:40.916 --> 01:31:42.708
What brings you here?

991
01:31:53.291 --> 01:31:55.000
I knew it.

992
01:31:56.208 --> 01:32:02.083
I always knew that God
has blessed this land.

993
01:32:03.083 --> 01:32:05.916
I knew it. Thank you. Holy Father.

994
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.541
Thank you.

995
01:32:08.041 --> 01:32:10.333
Do you trust this native?

996
01:32:11.916 --> 01:32:14.166
I have a feeling it's true.

997
01:32:15.291 --> 01:32:18.166
I'll check it out personally.

998
01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:19.708
What if it's not true?

999
01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:24.166
He's not the first native
to tell us a tale like that.

1000
01:32:25.833 --> 01:32:28.083
The question is.

1001
01:32:30.041 --> 01:32:32.208
what if it's true?

1002
01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:39.666
I've always trusted that God

1003
01:32:41.125 --> 01:32:45.208
has blessed all of us in this land.

1004
01:32:45.791 --> 01:32:48.875
and now I've confirmed it myself.

1005
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:53.333
I thank some of the witnesses

1006
01:32:54.083 --> 01:32:55.833
here with us today

1007
01:32:55.916 --> 01:32:59.333
for their faith and support

1008
01:32:59.416 --> 01:33:03.791
of the events
that occurred in our community.

1009
01:33:04.458 --> 01:33:09.916
Captain Miguel López de Elizalde.

1010
01:33:11.458 --> 01:33:14.041
don Gerónimo de Arona.

1011
01:33:16.125 --> 01:33:21.416
and this great painter. Francisco Flores.

1012
01:33:22.041 --> 01:33:27.583
The family has made a special request.

1013
01:33:28.375 --> 01:33:31.041
We grant them permission

1014
01:33:32.583 --> 01:33:36.166
to take the image of our Blessed Mother

1015
01:33:36.833 --> 01:33:40.916
to Guadalajara to be restored.

1016
01:33:42.041 --> 01:33:45.666
These two guards will accompany you

1017
01:33:46.208 --> 01:33:48.083
to protect the image.

1018
01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:53.458
May God be with you.
You have my blessing.

1019
01:33:55.083 --> 01:33:58.833
We want to thank you for your hospitality.

1020
01:34:00.083 --> 01:34:01.708
for your kindness.

1021
01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:06.000
and above all. for your help.

1022
01:34:07.458 --> 01:34:10.958
We will always be grateful to you.

1023
01:34:12.416 --> 01:34:14.000
And we also appreciate

1024
01:34:14.958 --> 01:34:18.083
the honor you bestow upon us

1025
01:34:18.166 --> 01:34:23.000
by allowing us to take the image
of our Blessed Mother to be restored

1026
01:34:23.083 --> 01:34:26.250
because she granted us
the greatest of miracles.

1027
01:34:27.583 --> 01:34:30.083
a second chance to be a family.

1028
01:34:35.291 --> 01:34:38.750
THE ROYAL ROAD TO GUADALAJARA

1029
01:35:01.666 --> 01:35:05.125
We just need to eat
and I'll bring our things down.

1030
01:35:07.416 --> 01:35:08.750
Excuse me. sir.

1031
01:35:12.541 --> 01:35:14.416
Do you need to restore any statues?

1032
01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:17.083
Are you guys from around here?

1033
01:35:17.583 --> 01:35:22.208
Yes. we're restoring statues
in a chapel nearby.

1034
01:35:25.041 --> 01:35:28.916
Okay. young lady. Go with Mom.

1035
01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:33.875
I got lucky.

1036
01:35:41.958 --> 01:35:45.541
This is the statue of our Blessed Mother

1037
01:35:46.458 --> 01:35:49.000
which I ask you to handle
with love and devotion.

1038
01:35:49.625 --> 01:35:54.250
They'll go with you.
I'll pay you when the job is done.

1039
01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:56.833
Very well.

1040
01:37:46.583 --> 01:37:50.833
Dad. Mom. Someone's knocking the door.

1041
01:37:51.791 --> 01:37:56.166
I'm going to have to get up.

1042
01:38:23.875 --> 01:38:27.333
Dad! Daddy! Wake up!

1043
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:35.708
What are you doing. young lady?
Where are the restorers?

1044
01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:38.166
They gave me the Virgin Mary and left.

1045
01:38:40.458 --> 01:38:43.375
Where are they?
Where did they go? I need to pay them.

1046
01:38:43.875 --> 01:38:47.791
It's okay. Dad. they are the angels
who protect the Virgin Mary.

1047
01:38:48.375 --> 01:38:49.916
Angels?

1048
01:38:50.833 --> 01:38:56.041
DE LA CORREA INN

1049
01:41:24.958 --> 01:41:26.375
Blessed Virgin.

1050
01:41:32.833 --> 01:41:34.625
Dear Virgin Mary.

1051
01:41:35.666 --> 01:41:39.333
Thank you for allowing me
to pray with you.

1052
01:42:35.166 --> 01:42:38.416
There are several representations
of our beloved Lady.

1053
01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:39.958
of Our Lady of San Juan.

1054
01:42:40.041 --> 01:42:44.291
It's very interesting that each pilgrim
has a different image of her.

1055
01:42:44.375 --> 01:42:49.416
This one is very important
for us sanjuanenses

1056
01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:52.458
because it's about an event
that marked our history.

1057
01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:57.250
Pope John Paul II
came to our town in 1990.

1058
01:42:57.333 --> 01:43:00.666
And over here
we have some audiovisual material.

1059
01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:02.666
San Juan de los Lagos.

1060
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:05.541
a wonderful place.

1061
01:43:05.625 --> 01:43:07.708
"Do not be conquered by evil.

1062
01:43:09.666 --> 01:43:14.125
But overcome evil with good."

1063
01:43:17.916 --> 01:43:20.875
Romans 12:21.

1064
01:43:22.791 --> 01:43:25.041
Congratulations to our graduates.

1065
01:43:37.541 --> 01:43:38.833
Congratulations. Pancho.

1066
01:43:38.916 --> 01:43:41.125
I'm so proud of you. my friend.

1067
01:43:41.208 --> 01:43:44.083
Thank you. Brandon. Meet my wife Carmen.

1068
01:43:44.166 --> 01:43:46.666
-Its a pleasure to meet you.
-The pleasure is mine.

1069
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:48.666
Pancho told us a lot about you.

1070
01:43:49.375 --> 01:43:52.666
Thank you for supporting Pancho

1071
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:57.208
all the way. because his life
has changed so incredibly.

1072
01:43:57.291 --> 01:43:59.125
Thanks to you and the workshop.

1073
01:43:59.208 --> 01:44:01.416
No. thanks to Pancho's good will.

1074
01:44:02.041 --> 01:44:07.333
He told me your daughter is hospitalized
with a very rare condition?

1075
01:44:07.416 --> 01:44:10.958
I contacted a close friend of mine
who is a specialist

1076
01:44:11.041 --> 01:44:14.416
in cases like your daughter's
for him to treat her.

1077
01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:16.708
and he's very willing to help you.

1078
01:44:18.083 --> 01:44:19.958
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

1079
01:44:22.208 --> 01:44:26.250
Thank you. Brandon.
But we can't afford a specialist.

1080
01:44:26.333 --> 01:44:28.541
Don't worry about the money.

1081
01:44:28.625 --> 01:44:31.333
I spoke with Pedrosa.
my good friend. the specialist.

1082
01:44:31.416 --> 01:44:36.750
He's aware of your case.
and he's willing to help you.

1083
01:44:36.833 --> 01:44:38.666
But he needs to see you right away.

1084
01:44:39.583 --> 01:44:40.958
That was the hospital.

1085
01:44:42.083 --> 01:44:45.500
Go. I'll tell Pedrosa to meet you there.

1086
01:44:46.041 --> 01:44:47.958
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

1087
01:44:48.041 --> 01:44:49.041
You're very welcome.

1088
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.166
And...

1089
01:44:57.708 --> 01:44:59.208
will she make it?

1090
01:45:00.708 --> 01:45:03.083
It's a complicated surgery.

1091
01:45:03.166 --> 01:45:08.125
but the sooner we do it. the better.
tomorrow if possible.

1092
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:13.916
Can we have a moment. please?

1093
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Sure.

1094
01:45:21.541 --> 01:45:23.291
What if the surgery fails?

1095
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.375
It's very risky.

1096
01:45:28.041 --> 01:45:29.958
but it's our only option.

1097
01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:40.458
Hello.

1098
01:45:56.041 --> 01:45:57.208
Carmen phoned.

1099
01:46:49.291 --> 01:46:50.916
Stand clear!

1100
01:47:11.166 --> 01:47:12.166
"Dear Father.

1101
01:47:13.208 --> 01:47:16.791
I know it's been many years
since I last wrote you.

1102
01:47:17.625 --> 01:47:20.375
But I want you to know
how kind life has been to me.

1103
01:47:20.958 --> 01:47:22.791
It's given me an amazing family.

1104
01:47:23.833 --> 01:47:27.416
You are the granddad
of two lovely princesses.

1105
01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:31.958
They're wonderful.
You'll meet them one day.

1106
01:47:32.958 --> 01:47:34.625
They took after Mom.

1107
01:47:36.375 --> 01:47:40.375
My life in the New World
has been a blessing.

1108
01:47:41.375 --> 01:47:43.541
My husband Santiago

1109
01:47:44.208 --> 01:47:46.875
is a little reckless.

1110
01:47:46.958 --> 01:47:50.500
but he's the most loyal and loving man
I've ever met.

1111
01:47:53.041 --> 01:47:56.583
There was a tragedy in our family
a few days ago.

1112
01:47:56.666 --> 01:47:59.833
but life has granted us another chance.

1113
01:47:59.958 --> 01:48:03.791
and I am forever grateful
to God and the Virgin Mary

1114
01:48:03.916 --> 01:48:06.791
for showering us
with blessings and well-being.

1115
01:48:06.875 --> 01:48:13.208
It's a totally new beginning
and I promise to live my life to the full.

1116
01:48:13.291 --> 01:48:16.125
If you ever decide
to return to the New World.

1117
01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:18.791
please do not hesitate to visit us.

1118
01:48:18.875 --> 01:48:22.166
Your family will welcome you
with our arms wide open.

1119
01:48:22.958 --> 01:48:27.541
God bless you. I love you. Father.
Your daughter."

1120
01:48:50.208 --> 01:48:51.458
Mom!

1121
01:49:02.083 --> 01:49:03.208
Dad!

1122
01:49:59.875 --> 01:50:01.916
Is it really you?

1123
01:50:02.458 --> 01:50:05.166
Yes. it's me. my child.

1124
01:50:06.166 --> 01:50:08.708
Why is all the pain gone?

1125
01:50:08.791 --> 01:50:10.375
Did you heal me?

1126
01:50:10.958 --> 01:50:12.708
I did more than that.

1127
01:50:12.791 --> 01:50:16.541
Your heart is now ready
to live a lot better.

1128
01:50:19.666 --> 01:50:20.958
Pedro!

1129
01:50:24.166 --> 01:50:27.833
-Why did you abandon him?
-I never did. Gabriela.

1130
01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:30.000
But why did you allow it?

1131
01:50:30.083 --> 01:50:35.291
Honey. people cross our paths
for a purpose.

1132
01:50:35.875 --> 01:50:38.916
And Pedrito has fulfilled his.

1133
01:50:40.333 --> 01:50:43.791
Gabriela. when I was born.
the doctors told my mom

1134
01:50:43.875 --> 01:50:47.000
I had three years to live.

1135
01:50:47.083 --> 01:50:49.750
I lived long enough to meet you.

1136
01:50:50.333 --> 01:50:51.875
But...

1137
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:57.833
Now we need to rekindle your love. honey.
Are you willing to do that?

1138
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:02.583
Come with us.

1139
01:51:47.291 --> 01:51:49.000
Who would've guessed. right?

1140
01:51:56.583 --> 01:52:00.500
So. buddy. What brings you here?

1141
01:52:01.541 --> 01:52:05.416
There are rumors all over New Spain
of a tightrope walker

1142
01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:08.458
who does some amazing feats
with his family.

1143
01:52:09.458 --> 01:52:12.833
And I only know one madman
who would do that.

1144
01:52:13.416 --> 01:52:16.291
So I'm here to confirm my suspicions.

1145
01:52:17.291 --> 01:52:20.125
You haven't changed much
in all these years.

1146
01:52:21.208 --> 01:52:23.583
I'm afraid you're mistaken. my friend.

1147
01:52:25.125 --> 01:52:27.958
The man you knew no longer exists.

1148
01:52:33.333 --> 01:52:36.166
God gave me a second chance.

1149
01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:39.541
I'm very pleased to hear that.

1150
01:52:41.125 --> 01:52:42.500
Tell me something.

1151
01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:45.625
How could that woman
become your wife?

1152
01:52:45.916 --> 01:52:47.500
I didn't think you'd do it.

1153
01:52:49.208 --> 01:52:50.375
It's been so long now.

1154
01:52:56.583 --> 01:52:58.500
She won me over. my friend.

1155
01:53:13.041 --> 01:53:16.208
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1156
01:53:16.291 --> 01:53:19.250
Any news about my daughter.
Gabriela Hernández?

1157
01:53:19.333 --> 01:53:21.583
We haven't had any updates in a while.

1158
01:53:24.541 --> 01:53:25.791
Come with me.

1159
01:53:33.166 --> 01:53:34.541
I'll get the doctor.

1160
01:53:47.583 --> 01:53:49.500
Hi. Princess.

1161
01:53:51.583 --> 01:53:53.291
How are you feeling?

1162
01:53:53.875 --> 01:53:56.916
Fine. Mom.
but my chest feels a little hot.

1163
01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.000
You'll be fine in no time.
And we'll go home.

1164
01:54:04.875 --> 01:54:05.750
Good afternoon.

1165
01:54:05.833 --> 01:54:07.666
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

1166
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:09.375
I see you heard the good news.

1167
01:54:12.416 --> 01:54:18.541
A few moments ago.
Gabriela was considered clinically dead.

1168
01:54:18.625 --> 01:54:22.000
But against all odds
we managed to bring her back.

1169
01:54:22.666 --> 01:54:26.416
All that matters
is there's no brain damage

1170
01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:30.583
and your daughter
is totally out of harm's way.

1171
01:54:32.708 --> 01:54:34.291
Everything went well.

1172
01:54:38.791 --> 01:54:42.208
SIX MONTHS LATER

1173
01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:17.791
Coming with Dad?

1174
01:55:17.875 --> 01:55:19.625
That's it. Let's go.

1175
01:55:19.708 --> 01:55:20.708
Miss.

1176
01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:22.791
Hi.

1177
01:55:22.875 --> 01:55:25.166
-Diego!
-Long time no see.

1178
01:55:25.250 --> 01:55:26.500
How are you?

1179
01:55:26.708 --> 01:55:28.291
Who is this little girl?

1180
01:55:28.375 --> 01:55:29.958
He's your uncle Diego.

1181
01:55:30.041 --> 01:55:33.291
-He's your uncle.
-Hello. I'm your uncle.

1182
01:55:33.375 --> 01:55:36.416
-How are you. young lady?
-I'm fine.

1183
01:55:37.375 --> 01:55:41.250
-Have you heard your dad's stories?
-No.

1184
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:48.833
As time goes by. and as the years go by.

1185
01:56:48.916 --> 01:56:51.833
generation after generation.

1186
01:56:51.916 --> 01:56:58.250
the faith never ends
and the miracles continue.

1187
01:56:58.375 --> 01:57:04.375
Entire caravans of pilgrims entreat you.
and thank you. Blessed Lady of San Juan.

1188
01:57:05.333 --> 01:57:12.041
Your story already spans
four centuries of miracles.

1189
