You wanted this.

But only in theory.
Like sex.

39
00:02:33.892 --> 00:02:36.025
Right. It's overrated.
Come on. get in there.

40
00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.201
Play for the tie. Go.

41
00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:40.943
Let's go.
Blue. let's go!

42
00:02:41.117 --> 00:02:43.424
I'd already
given God a few chances.

43
00:02:43.598 --> 00:02:46.078
Like when I asked him
for my period to start.

44
00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:48.733
And then when I prayed
for him to make him stop.

45
00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:53.042
This was his last shot
at redemption.

46
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.219
Nice pass.

47
00:02:56.393 --> 00:02:58.917
Hey. go. Go!

48
00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.965
-No. No!
-Steady. Lem.

49
00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:05.837
Get back!

50
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:11.887
What the hell. Lem?
The wrong goal?

51
00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:13.454
God blew it again.

52
00:03:14.672 --> 00:03:15.891
Are you kidding me?

53
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:21.984
You so suck.

54
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:28.730
Sit down.

55
00:03:31.036 --> 00:03:34.039
When someone's a failure.
everybody is a failure.

56
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.868
That's why
communism doesn't work.

This isn't Survivor.

60
00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:49.098
We can't just
vote her off the team.

61
00:03:49.272 --> 00:03:51.056
She shouldn't even
be on the team.

62
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.841
She was going to
jump off a roof.

63
00:03:53.537 --> 00:03:55.452
Why is it up to us
to make her life better anyway?

64
00:03:55.626 --> 00:03:57.237
I mean.
she lives in a frickin' car.

65
00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:58.803
She lives with her mom.

66
00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:00.240
Oh. have you seen her mom?

67
00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:01.763
She's gorgeous.

68
00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:03.025

70
00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:16.125
Oh. is that what you learned
at Hamburger High?

71
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:17.692
It's my major.

72
00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:19.737

74
00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.134
Ouch.
Sticks and stones. bitch.

75
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:35.710
Do you want to die?

76
00:04:35.884 --> 00:04:37.364
Too late.
I'm already dead.

77
00:04:40.236 --> 00:04:42.282
-Excessive. Lem. even for you.
-Well...

78
00:04:42.978 --> 00:04:45.415

wearing the purple eyeshadow.

79

81

82
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.791

84
00:05:22.017 --> 00:05:23.932
Hey.
Where are you going?

85
00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:26.151
My trainer charges

86
00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:29.416
Hey. Hey!

87
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:31.853
My mom's card.

88
00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:33.898
You still might want to
buy the house. right?

89
00:05:34.072 --> 00:05:35.247
I know how to reach her.

90
00:05:37.162 --> 00:05:39.817
What kind of sadist
names her kid Marge?

91
00:05:41.384 --> 00:05:43.343
My mom. That's who.

92
00:05:43.517 --> 00:05:45.649
Mini Marge Bickford.

93
00:05:45.823 --> 00:05:48.391
Realtor of the year.
five years ago.

94
00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:50.045
Shit.
did I forget to buy milk?

95
00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.439
Mm-hmm. It's okay.

96
00:05:52.613 --> 00:05:54.702
I'm off dairy.
Professional courtesy.

97
00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:56.660
Don't say that.
You're beautiful.

98
00:05:56.834 --> 00:05:59.489
You're beautiful.
I'm fat.

99
00:05:59.663 --> 00:06:01.752
The person you see in your head
is not who you are.

100
00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:03.406
The person I see.
is who you are.

101
00:06:03.885 --> 00:06:05.147
You're trying to sell me.

102
00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:07.323
Everything's a negotiation.

103
00:06:07.497 --> 00:06:09.369
Mm. always be closing. Mom.

104
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.676
That guy
gonna make an offer?

105
00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:15.070
He couldn't even make
the deposit.

106
00:06:17.202 --> 00:06:19.291
Ew. That's so gross.

107
00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:21.859
No utilities. honey.

108
00:06:22.643 --> 00:06:25.472
Don't worry.
We'll get there. I promise.

109
00:06:27.082 --> 00:06:28.126
Where is there?

110
00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:30.302
Only seen it
from a distance.

111
00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:33.828
But it looked just like you.
When you're happy.

112
00:06:35.482 --> 00:06:38.572
-Today's your day.
-Go take it.

113
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:41.923
Puker! Oh.

114
00:06:42.097 --> 00:06:43.751
Hello. bobby.

115
00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:45.405
It really
doesn't stress me out

116
00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:46.275
that my mom has sex
with clients.

117
00:06:48.538 --> 00:06:50.235
In fact.
the abnormality of it

118
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.672
sort of appeals to me.

119
00:06:51.846 --> 00:06:53.587
It's not sex
in the abstract.

120
00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:55.110
like a lot of parents
talk about.

121
00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:56.720
It's sex in the real.

122
00:06:56.894 --> 00:06:58.113
That mom
can trust me enough to know

123
00:06:58.287 --> 00:06:59.375
is kind of cool.

124
00:07:02.813 --> 00:07:04.293
Metaphors be with you.

125
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.513
Hey. Margie.

126
00:07:07.122 --> 00:07:09.167
-How's soccer?
-It's great.

127
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:10.430
Really?

128
00:07:10.952 --> 00:07:13.084
Hmm.
Big school. small world.

129
00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:15.565
Yeah. well.
club is really hard.

130
00:07:16.087 --> 00:07:17.741
Well. varsity
would love to have you.

131
00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:19.874
And club is better.
It's the next step.

132
00:07:20.048 --> 00:07:21.658
And because
your father played club.

133
00:07:22.398 --> 00:07:23.791
You know.
it's not his fault

134
00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:24.922
that he was 20 years
ahead of the game.

135
00:07:26.228 --> 00:07:28.099
It's not the part
that I'm blaming him for.

136
00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:29.449
Mr. Farnsworth.

137
00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:35.193
Did I tell you

138
00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:36.804
I have an exclusive
on that whole development?

139
00:07:36.978 --> 00:07:37.848
That's how we get to
stay there for free.

140
00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:39.328
No. We're squatters.

141
00:07:39.502 --> 00:07:40.590
We're homeless.
We are a statistic.

142
00:07:40.764 --> 00:07:41.983
No.
we're saving money.

143
00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:43.027
so we can buy
our own place.

144
00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:44.638
We're being frugal.

145
00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:46.335
And by that time.
I will be moving out.

146
00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:48.119
Oh. you discovered my plan.

147
00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:52.254
It's fine.
I'll just move in with Dad.

148
00:07:52.428 --> 00:07:54.343
-In prison?
-He's not in prison.

149
00:07:54.517 --> 00:07:56.911
-He should be.
-I'm allowed to miss him. Mom.

150
00:07:57.085 --> 00:07:58.347
Oh. please.

151
00:07:58.521 --> 00:07:59.696
You were two
when he dumped us.

152
00:08:00.828 --> 00:08:03.395
He hurts people. Margie.
He's a professional hurter.

153
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.788
And a professional
soccer player.

154
00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:06.268
For. like. an hour.

155
00:08:06.442 --> 00:08:07.574
Which is half
the amount of time

156
00:08:07.748 --> 00:08:09.053
of the best part
of our marriage.

157
00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:11.926
That is so gross.

158
00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:15.756
I thought it was destiny.
which used to pass for romance.

159
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:17.584
I want to know
what it's like

160
00:08:17.758 --> 00:08:19.411
to fall in love
for real someday.

161
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:21.892
Well. maybe
you shouldn't try so hard.

162
00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:23.241
Hey.

163
00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:25.635
I can't help it
if I meet a lot of men.

164
00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:28.638
Oh. well. this is the part
where she tells us

165
00:08:28.812 --> 00:08:30.858
the heartbreak
in being beautiful.

166
00:08:31.032 --> 00:08:32.990
You know.
sometimes I get lonely. Margie.

167
00:08:34.122 --> 00:08:35.427
Lonely or horny?

168
00:08:35.993 --> 00:08:38.256
What about hornly?

169
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.521
Hornly.

170
00:08:43.348 --> 00:08:44.436
That's what I am.

171
00:08:51.313 --> 00:08:52.444
Get out.

172
00:08:58.189 --> 00:08:59.234
Hey.

173
00:09:01.802 --> 00:09:03.281
You're my one in a million.
kid.

174
00:09:04.108 --> 00:09:05.240
Don't let 'em beat you up.

175
00:09:05.414 --> 00:09:07.895
-Mm-hmm. Love you.
-What?

176
00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:13.291
No worries.
A 60-day escrow is perfect.

177
00:09:13.465 --> 00:09:14.641
All right. let's do it.

178
00:09:14.815 --> 00:09:15.946
Let's put it in an offer.

179
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.079
Fabulous. Absolutely.

180
00:09:18.253 --> 00:09:20.037
The first of many.
Thank you.

181
00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:21.299
All right. Thanks. Marge.

182
00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:27.567
Okay. okay. okay.

183
00:09:29.612 --> 00:09:31.788
Hey. kid.
Your mom's a star.

184
00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:33.050
She just sold her--

185
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.592
And if you hold Marge
in your heart.

186
00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:54.724
please do the same
for her daughter.

187
00:09:54.898 --> 00:09:56.987
who she loved
more than anything else.

188
00:10:01.862 --> 00:10:04.212
This is what happens
in California.

189
00:10:05.343 --> 00:10:07.258
Frank. please.

190
00:10:07.998 --> 00:10:09.304
If it wasn't for California.

191
00:10:09.478 --> 00:10:12.002
she never would have met--

192
00:10:12.176 --> 00:10:15.092
Let's just say
we wouldn't be here now.

193
00:10:16.746 --> 00:10:18.269
I wouldn't be here.
either.

194
00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:20.489
Tomorrow.
we're leaving for Scottsdale.

195
00:10:22.099 --> 00:10:23.753
Can I at least
say goodbye to my friends?

196
00:10:26.147 --> 00:10:27.931
Just be ready
first thing in the morning.

197
00:10:30.238 --> 00:10:31.892
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:32.893 --> 00:10:35.547
Your grandfather
always wants to beat traffic.

199
00:11:25.423 --> 00:11:26.947
Arizona's not that bad.

200
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:29.166
It's
an air-conditioned nightmare.

201
00:11:30.602 --> 00:11:32.692
I hardly even talk
to my grandparents.

202
00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:36.696
You know. they only ever called
to yell at my mom

203
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.262
about marrying my dad.

204
00:11:40.395 --> 00:11:42.919
-I should go live with him.
-In Mexico?

205
00:11:46.662 --> 00:11:47.881
My dad is in Mexico?

206
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.752
I'm guessing.

207
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:53.800
My dad is in Mexico.
isn't he?

208
00:11:53.974 --> 00:11:55.018
I'm not sure.

209
00:11:57.325 --> 00:11:59.240
How long have you known
that my dad is in Mexico?

210
00:12:03.766 --> 00:12:05.899
You-- you--

211
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:09.598
I can't--

212
00:12:14.124 --> 00:12:15.822
This is between you
and your grandparents. Margie.

213
00:12:15.996 --> 00:12:17.040
you know?

214
00:12:49.856 --> 00:12:50.900
No!

215
00:13:06.698 --> 00:13:07.699
You want me to come?

216
00:13:08.483 --> 00:13:10.180
No. Just wait here.

217
00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:19.032
No more chances.

218
00:15:01.117 --> 00:15:02.162
Mexico.

219
00:15:34.194 --> 00:15:35.499
Sh-- shut up.

220
00:15:43.638 --> 00:15:46.554
♪ Just ways to behavin' ♪

221
00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:53.039
♪ And I've shown you the kind of
man that I could be ♪

222
00:15:54.866 --> 00:15:57.565
♪ Like bringin'
the sunlight ♪

223
00:15:57.739 --> 00:16:00.568
♪ Out of a dark night ♪

224
00:16:00.742 --> 00:16:04.354
♪ Like a perfect wave
that's waitin' there for me ♪

225
00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:18.934
-Hey. buddy.
-Can I swim?

226
00:16:19.108 --> 00:16:21.632
Think not.
You were doing good.

227
00:16:38.345 --> 00:16:39.737
You don't even have a passport?

228
00:16:40.477 --> 00:16:41.565
You don't need a passport

229
00:16:41.739 --> 00:16:42.871
if you're leaving.

230
00:16:46.222 --> 00:16:48.529
You can't just go and do this.
Marge. it's insane.

231
00:16:48.703 --> 00:16:50.705
If I don't find my dad.
I'm going to be an orphan.

232
00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:52.707
Who's the drama queen here?
Please.

233
00:16:52.968 --> 00:16:54.970
You have family
in-- in Arizona.

234
00:16:55.144 --> 00:16:57.016
-Have you met them?
-No.

235
00:16:57.538 --> 00:16:58.669
They wouldn't like you.

236
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.584
Nobody does.

237
00:17:02.804 --> 00:17:03.848
Come here.

238
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:07.722
Puker. come on.

239
00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:12.205
What do you want me
to tell everyone

240
00:17:12.379 --> 00:17:13.728
when the federales
find your body?

241
00:17:13.902 --> 00:17:16.122
Um. that it was all
their fault.

242
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.081
This is serious. Marge.

243
00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:21.388
Right?
Like. life-changing serious.

244
00:17:21.562 --> 00:17:23.564
I know.
That's why I'm doing it.

245
00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:27.568
Is it okay to tell you that
I'm really gonna miss you?

246
00:17:29.526 --> 00:17:30.571
Sure.

247
00:17:33.095 --> 00:17:34.836
Can I give you something
to remember me by?

248
00:17:37.969 --> 00:17:39.058
Okay.

249
00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:43.236
How about
if I give you my dog?

250
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.239
-I knew there'd be a catch.
-Nope. No. there isn't.

251
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:49.155
But. you know.
I googled it.

252
00:17:49.329 --> 00:17:51.070
and. uh. you can't take a dog
into Mexico

253
00:17:51.244 --> 00:17:52.506
without vaccinations.

254
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.811
And that can take
at least a week.

255
00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:56.249
-So. wait.
-No.

256
00:17:56.423 --> 00:17:58.512
I'd whimp out
and I'd end up in Scottsdale.

257
00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:03.169
Goodbye. my little...

258
00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.174
There you go. Bye. Pukes.

259
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.001
Gonna miss you.

260
00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:11.829
Bye. Puker.

261
00:18:13.004 --> 00:18:14.093
You still call him that?

262
00:18:33.068 --> 00:18:34.113
Siri.

263
00:18:35.288 --> 00:18:40.119
Directions
to Lo de Marcos.

264
00:18:40.293 --> 00:18:42.469
Getting directions
for low daycare prices.

265
00:18:42.643 --> 00:18:43.731
No.

266
00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:50.259
S-- directions
to Lo de Marcos.

267
00:18:54.437 --> 00:18:55.482
To--

268
00:19:07.233 --> 00:19:09.365
-What?
-It's very far.

269
00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:14.805
-Gracias.
-You're welcome.

270
00:19:21.812 --> 00:19:23.031
Mexico is...

271
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.425
nice.

272
00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:27.601
Pretty.

273
00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:29.429
Green.

274
00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:31.474
And there's a lot of food.

275
00:19:31.648 --> 00:19:33.607
Really good food.

276
00:20:02.723 --> 00:20:05.508
Go. go. go. go. go!

277
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:10.905
Hey. Blue!

278
00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:12.036
What are ya doing?

279
00:20:14.256 --> 00:20:16.215
-What're you saying?
-Follow. follow. follow.

280
00:20:16.911 --> 00:20:18.217
Get on her! Go!

281
00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:21.785
It's like a bunch of kids
chasing a ball.

282
00:20:21.959 --> 00:20:24.571
Guys. I am tired
of looking in this direction.

283
00:20:27.835 --> 00:20:30.185
No. no. no!

284
00:20:32.883 --> 00:20:33.971
Fuck!

285
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.452
Oh. shit!

286
00:20:37.845 --> 00:20:39.629
Oh. come on. Darn it!

287
00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:50.249
This might be one of
the stupider things I've done.

288
00:21:00.171 --> 00:21:01.738
All right.
all right. all right.

289
00:21:03.305 --> 00:21:04.350
Yeah. yeah.

290
00:21:04.959 --> 00:21:06.090
Listen.

291
00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.789
We are championship material.

292
00:21:09.442 --> 00:21:10.791
We're this close.

293
00:21:11.313 --> 00:21:13.707
We still have four more games
left in the playoff.

294
00:21:13.881 --> 00:21:14.969
Okay?

295
00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:17.972
Yoo-hoo. Okay?

296
00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:23.586
Who's buying
the cervezastonight?

297
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.241
Aw. see?
Oh. you got that one!

298
00:21:26.415 --> 00:21:29.157
All right.
Yo? Again? Okay.

299
00:21:31.377 --> 00:21:33.814
I got the cooler.

300
00:21:40.821 --> 00:21:43.084
Darn it!

301
00:22:00.449 --> 00:22:01.668
I knew
if I waited here long enough.

302
00:22:01.842 --> 00:22:02.930
you would show up.

303
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.630
Did Elsa send you?

304
00:22:11.417 --> 00:22:14.463
No-- uh.
I don't speak the language.

305
00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.596
My girlfriend.

306
00:22:18.902 --> 00:22:20.208
No. I don't know her.

307
00:22:21.992 --> 00:22:23.167
I-- I know him.

308
00:22:32.133 --> 00:22:33.352
Hey.

309
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:35.571
Where'd you get that?

310
00:22:36.746 --> 00:22:39.183
I inherited it.

311
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:43.840
I got one just like it.

312
00:22:44.014 --> 00:22:45.233
It's from my mom.

313
00:22:46.452 --> 00:22:47.844
Marge Bickford?

314
00:22:50.194 --> 00:22:51.805
Marge is your mom?

315
00:22:53.023 --> 00:22:54.590
Uh. she was. she...

316
00:22:55.417 --> 00:22:56.940
she-- she's gone now.

317
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:06.689
Marge died?

318
00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:11.912
How?

319
00:23:15.306 --> 00:23:16.395
The hard way.

320
00:23:18.222 --> 00:23:19.485
Well. when?

321
00:23:21.312 --> 00:23:22.401
Uh. recently.

322
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:28.755
Wait...

323
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.975
who are you?

324
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.238
I'm your daughter.

325
00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:37.067
You're my daughter?

326
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.331
-Yeah. I'm-- I'm Margie.
-Holy shit!

327
00:23:45.293 --> 00:23:46.642
Are you drunk?

328
00:23:46.816 --> 00:23:48.731
Not as much
as I was a minute ago.

329
00:23:50.646 --> 00:23:52.213
That's all you can say?

330
00:23:53.388 --> 00:23:55.477
-I don't know. give me a minute.
-You've had 14 years.

331
00:23:58.306 --> 00:24:00.395
Wait. You got an ID?

332
00:24:19.414 --> 00:24:20.720
Holy shit.

333
00:24:54.275 --> 00:24:55.494
Oh. boy.

334
00:24:58.714 --> 00:25:01.412
I carried this
in my pocket for over a month.

335
00:25:01.587 --> 00:25:04.851
-You were scared?
-No. I was terrified.

336
00:25:07.027 --> 00:25:08.942
I loved your mom so much.

337
00:25:09.682 --> 00:25:11.118
Right up until
she kicked me out.

338
00:25:12.989 --> 00:25:14.687
So. why didn't
you fight for us?

339
00:25:15.209 --> 00:25:16.819
You know. like.
try and make it work?

340
00:25:17.472 --> 00:25:18.908
Because I was in handcuffs

341
00:25:19.082 --> 00:25:21.694
and. um. I just wrecked
the family Porsche.

342
00:25:24.914 --> 00:25:26.002
Where is she?

343
00:25:26.829 --> 00:25:28.483
Oh. man.
you're gonna love her.

344
00:25:28.657 --> 00:25:29.702
She is so--

345
00:25:30.311 --> 00:25:33.183
She's so sweet
and kind. smart.

346
00:25:33.662 --> 00:25:35.098
Like-- I don't know.

347
00:25:36.709 --> 00:25:38.145
What's wrong? You okay?

348
00:25:39.102 --> 00:25:41.714
Yeah. I'm-- I'm fine. I'm--
I'm nervous to meet her is all.

349
00:25:41.888 --> 00:25:44.804
Yeah. she makes me
a little nervous. too.

350
00:25:44.978 --> 00:25:47.241
But-- so.
I'm going to have a cerveza.

351
00:25:47.415 --> 00:25:48.459
You?

352
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.418
Isn't it a little early?

353
00:25:50.592 --> 00:25:52.333
Um. well...

354
00:25:53.377 --> 00:25:55.118
we're on London time here. so...

355
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.956
-Hey. there she is!
-We're not open yet.

356
00:26:08.305 --> 00:26:11.570
Um.
can't beat the service here.

357
00:26:11.744 --> 00:26:13.180
Don't worry.

358
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.312
I'm gonna need some ID

359
00:26:15.486 --> 00:26:17.750
-for your new drinking buddy.
-What?

360
00:26:17.924 --> 00:26:19.360
I don't know what's your plan.
muchachita.

361
00:26:19.534 --> 00:26:21.144
but this guy
comes with a warning label.

362
00:26:21.318 --> 00:26:23.886
-Just so you know. Okay?
-Oh! No. no. no! Elsa!

363
00:26:24.626 --> 00:26:25.714
Sorry. Hold on a sec.

364
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.412
-Elsa! Elsa. Please--
-What? What? What?

365
00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:30.589
Can-- Elsa.
can-- can I-- I'm sorry.

366
00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:32.634
Can I introduce you?
Please?

367
00:26:32.808 --> 00:26:34.288
Just one second

368
00:26:34.462 --> 00:26:35.855
and then you can go
back to work. all right?

369
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:38.814
Just let me introduce you.
Please. Come on.

370
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.164
Elsa...

371
00:26:42.165 --> 00:26:43.384
this is my daughter.

372
00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:47.823
Margie.

373
00:26:49.129 --> 00:26:50.173
Margie?

374
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.611
I'm sorry. Hi.

375
00:26:52.785 --> 00:26:55.135
-I'm Elsa.
-Mucho gusto.

376
00:26:55.309 --> 00:26:56.745
Mucho gusto.

377
00:26:56.919 --> 00:26:58.747
-Margie's visiting.
-For how long?

378
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:00.836
-I dunno.
-Forever.

379
00:27:01.881 --> 00:27:05.058
-Well--
-No. I-- I wanna live with you.

380
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.062
-What?
-If you have space.

381
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.325
Oh. he has plenty of room.

382
00:27:12.543 --> 00:27:15.155
-Yeah. but it-- it leaks.
-Yeah. only in the rainy season.

383
00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:17.026
Well. yeah.

384
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.549
You know. the hard part
is gonna be putting up with him.

385
00:27:18.724 --> 00:27:20.203
-Oh. I'll give it a try.
-Good.

386
00:27:20.377 --> 00:27:21.814
Because Los de Marcos
needs more strong women.

387
00:27:21.988 --> 00:27:24.381
Uh. look. I'm-- I--

388
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.383
I-- I'm a heavy drinker.

389
00:27:26.557 --> 00:27:27.689
Don't say that--

390
00:27:27.863 --> 00:27:29.169
-I do.
-Stop.

391
00:27:29.343 --> 00:27:31.040
-No. it's bad.
-I just--

392
00:27:31.214 --> 00:27:32.694
-No. I drink a lot.
-You drink-- Don't say that--

393
00:27:32.868 --> 00:27:34.478
-No. it's--
-Well. okay.

394
00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:35.784
Look. will you let me
raise my daughter. please?

395
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:39.309
-Did he really just say that?
-He did. He did.

396
00:27:39.788 --> 00:27:41.921
Your blood is in her heart.
Jackson.

397
00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:43.705
Oh. my God.

398
00:27:43.879 --> 00:27:45.751
Drama is such a big part
of the culture down here.

399
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:51.060
See? Look. okay.

400
00:27:51.234 --> 00:27:53.628
Just. um. we'll try...

401
00:27:55.804 --> 00:27:56.849
a month.

402
00:27:58.198 --> 00:27:59.242
But...

403
00:28:05.335 --> 00:28:06.728
What?

404
00:28:06.902 --> 00:28:10.123
It is his house.
so he makes the rules.

405
00:28:10.297 --> 00:28:11.559
He has rules?

406
00:28:12.038 --> 00:28:13.692
I surf
when there's a swell.

407
00:28:13.866 --> 00:28:15.606
I sleep when there isn't.
so don't set an alarm.

408
00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:18.435
I'll assume that you know
everything you have to know

409
00:28:18.609 --> 00:28:21.090
-about Kotex and condoms.
-Ew.

410
00:28:21.264 --> 00:28:23.527
As far as boys are concerned.
don't bring them home

411
00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:24.659
if they're kooks or creeps.

412
00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:26.922
-Cool?
-Mm-hmm.

413
00:28:28.837 --> 00:28:30.230
Just humor him.

414
00:28:30.404 --> 00:28:31.492
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

415
00:28:37.672 --> 00:28:41.110
Welcome to Lo de Marcos.
This is so exciting.

416
00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:48.117
I get 10% of any deals
made on the golf course. Frank.

417
00:28:50.554 --> 00:28:51.730
Yes. it's Frank Nelson.

418
00:28:52.948 --> 00:28:55.298
Frank. It's. uh. Jackson.

419
00:28:55.864 --> 00:28:57.866
I told you
never to contact me.

420
00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.564
-That hasn't changed.
-I'm sorry for your loss. Frank.

421
00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:02.523
And the last thing I want
is your sympathy.

422
00:29:05.526 --> 00:29:06.614
Um...

423
00:29:07.571 --> 00:29:09.095
Margie is with me.

424
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:10.618
Well. seeing
as how she walked out on us

425
00:29:10.792 --> 00:29:12.402
when her mom died.

426
00:29:12.576 --> 00:29:13.490
tells me you two
will get along just fine.

427
00:29:14.317 --> 00:29:15.318
Look. I. um...

428
00:29:16.624 --> 00:29:18.931
Margie's safe and I just
wanted you to know that.

429
00:29:19.105 --> 00:29:20.584
-Okay?
-I'll tell Betty.

430
00:30:08.371 --> 00:30:10.852
Oh.

431
00:30:33.309 --> 00:30:34.571
Hey. what's the password?

432
00:30:35.485 --> 00:30:36.486
Broken.

433
00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:43.232
-No. that's not it.
-No. No. as in it's busted.

434
00:30:44.364 --> 00:30:45.365
There's no internet.

435
00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:47.889
How do you not have internet?

436
00:30:49.412 --> 00:30:51.893
I dunno. 'Cause I don't.

437
00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:55.375
Well. what about.
like. Snapchat?

438
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:57.072
Well.
who am I gonna Snapchat at?

439
00:30:57.246 --> 00:31:00.249
Um. Elsa.

440
00:31:00.989 --> 00:31:02.469
She snaps at me
without it.

441
00:31:03.687 --> 00:31:06.603
I get all the information I need
just looking out my window.

442
00:31:07.169 --> 00:31:08.867
Nothing works.

443
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:11.695
Look. my priorities
are to keep this town running.

444
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.480
surf in second.
I'm third.

445
00:31:16.613 --> 00:31:17.658
Where do I fit in?

446
00:31:20.748 --> 00:31:22.532
Yeah. I'm still trying
to figure that one out.

447
00:31:24.578 --> 00:31:25.666
But...

448
00:31:27.407 --> 00:31:29.104
I think I'm gonna love
the challenge.

449
00:31:31.106 --> 00:31:32.978
Are you going surfing?

450
00:31:33.152 --> 00:31:34.414
You will get to a point

451
00:31:34.588 --> 00:31:35.937
where you won't have to
ask that.

452
00:31:36.938 --> 00:31:38.026
Can you teach me?

453
00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:42.161
You know. you can't really
teach someone how to surf.

454
00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:44.380
It's like walking.

455
00:31:44.554 --> 00:31:46.034
No one taught you how to walk.
did they?

456
00:31:46.948 --> 00:31:49.081
Well. you and Mom did.

457
00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:51.648
No. we just picked you up
when you fell down.

458
00:31:52.345 --> 00:31:53.824
Walking part
you did on your own.

459
00:31:56.044 --> 00:31:57.089
Help yourself.

460
00:32:28.207 --> 00:32:29.469
Oh! Oh!

461
00:32:55.799 --> 00:32:56.844
Had enough?

462
00:32:58.106 --> 00:32:59.673
I'm just getting started.

463
00:33:00.891 --> 00:33:01.980
All right.

464
00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:05.374
Waves come in sets.

465
00:33:06.332 --> 00:33:08.203
Here. usually
three or four at a time.

466
00:33:08.377 --> 00:33:09.552
Then there's a lull.

467
00:33:10.205 --> 00:33:11.380
That's when you paddle out.

468
00:33:11.554 --> 00:33:12.860
Now.
you sit off to the side

469
00:33:13.034 --> 00:33:14.688
from where the wave
starts to break.

470
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.516
The part that curls.
okay?

471
00:33:17.952 --> 00:33:19.606
Float on your board.
on the shoulder.

472
00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.651
that's that rolling hump
coming out the back.

473
00:33:22.652 --> 00:33:25.264
And rest. okay? Chill.

474
00:33:26.221 --> 00:33:28.180
And watch. Always watch.

475
00:33:28.354 --> 00:33:30.399
Watch for waves.
watch for sharks.

476
00:33:30.573 --> 00:33:31.748
watch the horizon.

477
00:33:33.533 --> 00:33:34.577
Watch your ass.

478
00:33:37.058 --> 00:33:38.103
Cool?

479
00:33:40.627 --> 00:33:42.368
Nobody surfs
the first day. Margie.

480
00:33:43.456 --> 00:33:44.500
Takes a lifetime.

481
00:34:29.241 --> 00:34:31.547
Nobody surfs
the first day. Margie.

482
00:34:37.901 --> 00:34:40.948
No. Takes a lifetime.

483
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:43.516
You'll get it.

484
00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:11.065
"La Margies." is that me?

485
00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:14.634
Uh. that's the town crier.

486
00:35:14.808 --> 00:35:16.592
Telling everyone
the latest chisme.

487
00:35:16.766 --> 00:35:18.594
That's you.

488
00:35:18.768 --> 00:35:21.162
-What's chisme?
-Gossip.

489
00:35:22.207 --> 00:35:24.383
Great.
What are they saying?

490
00:35:24.861 --> 00:35:25.906
He's saying...

491
00:35:27.516 --> 00:35:29.127
that you came here
to save me.

492
00:35:32.913 --> 00:35:34.697
Maybe you got that one
backwards.

493
00:35:35.742 --> 00:35:36.873
Maybe.

494
00:35:39.311 --> 00:35:41.530
Hey. there's practice
this afternoon.

495
00:35:41.704 --> 00:35:42.966
-You coming?
-Yeah.

496
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:44.925
All right.
Well. see you there.

497
00:35:45.621 --> 00:35:46.666
Okay?

498
00:35:47.841 --> 00:35:49.190
Hey.

499
00:35:49.364 --> 00:35:51.845
Nothing hungrier
than surf hungry. huh?

500
00:35:53.412 --> 00:35:55.588
I haven't been able to eat much
since Mom died.

501
00:35:56.415 --> 00:35:57.459
Try drinking.

502
00:36:03.813 --> 00:36:05.467
I wonder
how many karma points you lose

503
00:36:05.641 --> 00:36:08.078
for using your dead mom
as an excuse to binge.

504
00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:16.217
I promised myself
I would only do it

505
00:36:16.391 --> 00:36:17.566
when I felt really bad.

506
00:36:19.699 --> 00:36:23.659
Which wasn't great.
because I felt bad a lot.

507
00:36:26.575 --> 00:36:27.620
-Hi.
-Hi.

508
00:36:28.534 --> 00:36:29.535
Are you sick?

509
00:36:30.492 --> 00:36:32.451
Seasick.
I went surfing.

510
00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:35.671
How'd that go?

511
00:36:36.324 --> 00:36:37.934
Still waiting
for it to change my life.

512
00:36:39.414 --> 00:36:41.373
Wow.
I see you did the dishes.

513
00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:44.245
Yeah. I'm--
I'm staying here. so...

514
00:36:45.551 --> 00:36:46.639
And you fixed that.

515
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.077
-It's just a bulb.
-Well. don't tell him.

516
00:36:51.818 --> 00:36:53.733
You know. Marge. I...

517
00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:56.301
I used to get sick.

518
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:57.824
From surfing?

519
00:36:57.998 --> 00:36:59.173
No. no. from...

520
00:37:00.174 --> 00:37:01.262
from eating.

521
00:37:02.307 --> 00:37:04.265
You know. Mexico
is the comfort food capital

522
00:37:04.439 --> 00:37:05.527
of the world. so...

523
00:37:06.311 --> 00:37:08.138
you know. who doesn't wanna be
comfortable?

524
00:37:09.792 --> 00:37:10.837
I'm comfortable.

525
00:37:11.533 --> 00:37:12.795
Elsa. I am fine.

526
00:37:12.969 --> 00:37:15.537
Are you? Okay. Good.

527
00:37:16.712 --> 00:37:18.540
Well. tell your dad
I-- I stopped by. okay?

528
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.325
I will.

529
00:37:22.936 --> 00:37:23.980
Take care of yourself.

530
00:37:42.216 --> 00:37:43.696
Hey.

531
00:38:10.157 --> 00:38:13.073
Control it. Go.

532
00:38:14.248 --> 00:38:15.293
That's it.

533
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:21.560
Wow. You have a big kick.

534
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.692
What.
you never googled me?

535
00:38:24.954 --> 00:38:26.129
I was afraid to.

536
00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:27.914
college ride.

537
00:38:28.088 --> 00:38:30.046
Signed with Portsmouth.
300K a year.

538
00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:32.788
First season.
started every game.

539
00:38:32.962 --> 00:38:35.138
Met your mom.
got married. had you.

540
00:38:36.096 --> 00:38:38.054
Second season.
learned how to drink.

541
00:38:39.055 --> 00:38:42.058
Uh. wrecked two cars.
got arrested. ruined my life.

542
00:38:43.451 --> 00:38:44.496
Went surfing.

543
00:38:47.412 --> 00:38:48.587
You?

544
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:52.460
Mm.
Fat. slow. unpopular.

545
00:38:52.982 --> 00:38:54.636
Only ever played
when we were way ahead.

546
00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:56.334
or way behind.

547
00:38:57.247 --> 00:38:58.336
Quit.

548
00:38:59.206 --> 00:39:00.294
'Cause I hated it.

549
00:39:02.644 --> 00:39:03.689
Went to Mexico.

550
00:39:05.517 --> 00:39:07.345
You left out the part
about your mom dying.

551
00:39:12.437 --> 00:39:14.395
These ladies are--
are really good.

552
00:39:15.178 --> 00:39:16.266
Yeah.

553
00:39:17.267 --> 00:39:18.834
I mean. two years ago.

554
00:39:19.008 --> 00:39:20.140
they couldn't kick
their boyfriends out of bed.

555
00:39:20.314 --> 00:39:22.272
But they--
oh. I'm sorry.

556
00:39:22.447 --> 00:39:23.578
That wasn't very dadlike.
was it?

557
00:39:24.927 --> 00:39:26.102
How well
did you know Mom?

558
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:30.150
You should've stuck around.
you would've liked us.

559
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:34.415
Well. I don't think
you would've been too crazy

560
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:36.461
about the kind of dad
I was back then.

561
00:39:37.026 --> 00:39:38.114
What kind is that?

562
00:39:39.768 --> 00:39:40.813
This kind.

563
00:39:45.252 --> 00:39:47.733
Hey. Go.

564
00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:50.388
-No. no. no. no.
-Yeah. Come on.

565
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.391
Can't just sit there.
Come on. Go.

566
00:39:54.479 --> 00:39:55.610
There you go. kid.

567
00:40:02.922 --> 00:40:03.966
Get in there. kid!

568
00:40:28.469 --> 00:40:30.428
I wonder
if drinking too much

569
00:40:30.602 --> 00:40:33.561
feels as bad
as eating too much.

570
00:40:35.084 --> 00:40:36.564
I wonder
if it runs in the family.

571
00:40:36.738 --> 00:40:38.958
like big kicks.

572
00:40:39.132 --> 00:40:40.176
And quitting.

573
00:40:59.674 --> 00:41:01.720
Sorry. uh.
I don't speak Spanish.

574
00:41:03.635 --> 00:41:04.984
I speak English.
Like Harry Potter.

575
00:41:05.724 --> 00:41:09.205
Hey. I saw you at.
um. Tal Ivan.

576
00:41:10.772 --> 00:41:13.253
-What?
-Uh. the tacos.

577
00:41:13.427 --> 00:41:14.515
When?

578
00:41:15.429 --> 00:41:16.822
You no remember Chilo?

579
00:41:18.432 --> 00:41:19.694
Not really.

580
00:41:22.088 --> 00:41:24.351
I. um--
I teach you how to surf.

581
00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:28.268
My dad says that no one
can teach you how to surf.

582
00:41:30.531 --> 00:41:31.924
He never meet Chilo.

583
00:41:34.535 --> 00:41:35.971
Come on. I teach you.

584
00:41:36.145 --> 00:41:38.104
-What? Now?
-Yeah. Let's go. Come on.

585
00:41:38.278 --> 00:41:40.933

Who also happens to be
mi nueva hija.Chilo.

615
00:43:10.979 --> 00:43:12.154
Uh...

616
00:43:14.896 --> 00:43:16.115
When did you get
a daughter?

617
00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:19.031
I ordered one.
Long time ago.

618
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.511
-She just got here.
-I--

619
00:43:46.406 --> 00:43:48.495
What did he say?

620
00:43:49.235 --> 00:43:51.454
Uh. to be a gentleman.

621
00:43:52.804 --> 00:43:54.066
Huh.

622
00:43:54.893 --> 00:43:57.765
-Jackson is your papa?
-Yeah.

623
00:44:00.072 --> 00:44:01.116
You're lucky.

624
00:44:02.074 --> 00:44:03.815
Lo de Marcos
loves him very much.

625
00:44:04.946 --> 00:44:06.774
He-- he brings us pride.

626
00:44:11.431 --> 00:44:12.519
Him?

627
00:44:26.228 --> 00:44:28.187
So. how many boys
have kissed you?

628
00:44:29.362 --> 00:44:32.626
That's--
I'm not telling you that.

629
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.888
Okay.

630
00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:36.804
So. how many Mexican boys
have you kissed?

631
00:44:37.979 --> 00:44:39.154
It's easy. None.

632
00:44:47.249 --> 00:44:48.555
Well. now it's one.

633
00:45:08.488 --> 00:45:09.750
All right.
let's bring it in.

634
00:45:11.012 --> 00:45:13.536
Azus.

635
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.190
Stay positivo.

636
00:45:18.193 --> 00:45:20.065
Whistle doesn't even--
bring it in.

637
00:45:20.239 --> 00:45:22.763
Atención.
Come on. All right.

638
00:45:23.895 --> 00:45:25.026
We're two players short.

639
00:45:26.027 --> 00:45:27.420
so everybody's gotta play
the whole game.

640
00:45:27.594 --> 00:45:29.422
but we can do it. okay?

641
00:45:29.596 --> 00:45:30.902
Go ahead. All right.

642
00:45:31.641 --> 00:45:34.166
García. Placencia. Veneda.
Rodríguez. Morales. Guerra.

643
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.559
Martínez. Avalos.

-D-- Dad. no. please. no.

648
00:45:51.487 --> 00:45:53.663
No. I will not do it.
Please. please don't make me.

649
00:45:53.838 --> 00:45:54.926
You need a jersey.
Here. wear mine.

00:45:59.713 --> 00:46:03.108
Mi equipo. yo jofe-- yo jefe?

651
00:46:03.282 --> 00:46:05.588
What is it?
What do I say? Just talk to her.

00:46:06.851 --> 00:46:09.767
Hey. you know what.

653
00:46:09.941 --> 00:46:11.638
that-- that she's a good goalie.

654
00:46:20.473 --> 00:46:22.692
They don't want me here.
I'm an expert at this part.

655
00:46:22.867 --> 00:46:25.608
Oh. Nayeli will get over it.
Eventually.

656
00:46:25.783 --> 00:46:27.872
-She's so pissed.
-This is how it was back home.

657
00:46:28.437 --> 00:46:30.178
-I'm not going to do it.
-You have to.

658
00:46:30.352 --> 00:46:31.614
-No!
-Yeah.

659
00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:33.616
My house. my rules.

660
00:46:37.185 --> 00:46:39.013
-This is so unfair.
-No. you know what?

661
00:46:39.187 --> 00:46:41.886
Eating termites off a stick to
stay alive. tha-- that's unfair.

662
00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.844
This is Mexican football.

663
00:46:44.018 --> 00:46:45.324
You know. and you're right
with the drama being a big deal

664
00:46:45.498 --> 00:46:46.934
down here.
so if you humiliate me.

665
00:46:47.108 --> 00:46:48.718
I'm gonna hate you
for the rest of my life.

666
00:46:48.893 --> 00:46:50.764
Okay.
That's what dads are for.

667
00:46:50.938 --> 00:46:52.200
Oh. two days
and you're an expert?

668
00:46:55.987 --> 00:46:57.379
Does this make me look fat?

669
00:46:58.816 --> 00:46:59.860
Proud.

670
00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:03.385

That's it.

680
00:47:43.382 --> 00:47:44.949
That's a foul!

681
00:47:45.123 --> 00:47:46.211
Hey.
how do you say foul?

682
00:47:46.385 --> 00:47:47.386
-Faul.
-Faul.

683
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.517

There you go.

692
00:48:24.553 --> 00:48:28.253
Right. right. go. go!

693
00:48:32.692 --> 00:48:33.736
Perfect. perfect.

706
00:50:02.086 --> 00:50:04.001
Ooh. Jesus.

707
00:50:10.311 --> 00:50:12.009
You have to start
treating yourself better.

708
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:15.186
You first.

709
00:50:17.884 --> 00:50:19.712
Don't bullshit me. Margie.

710
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:22.584
You make yourself sick. too.

711
00:50:23.672 --> 00:50:24.760
Did Elsa tell you that?

712
00:50:25.761 --> 00:50:28.721
-She said it was a possibility.
-Yeah. well. I did.

713
00:50:30.027 --> 00:50:31.071
But now I don't.

714
00:50:32.725 --> 00:50:34.161
You still drink.

715
00:50:35.249 --> 00:50:36.772
Yeah. well.
how would I know?

716
00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:38.426
Because you fall down
and then you throw up.

717
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.646
-that's a clue.
-No. no. no.

718
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.604
About your bulimia.
smartass.

719
00:50:48.393 --> 00:50:51.048
I did it to get rid of the parts
me that I didn't like.

720
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.789
And then when it was over.

721
00:50:53.963 --> 00:50:55.182
it was the only parts
that were left.

722
00:50:57.706 --> 00:51:00.187
That sounds like the lie
I tell myself about drinking.

723
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:05.671
There are more parts of me
that I like now.

724
00:51:06.324 --> 00:51:08.891
What. now that Chilo
was being nice to you?

725
00:51:10.763 --> 00:51:11.851
No.

726
00:51:12.895 --> 00:51:14.071
Maybe because you are.

727
00:51:15.811 --> 00:51:17.465
I mean. I jumped
into the middle of your life

728
00:51:17.639 --> 00:51:19.685
and you didn't make me
feel bad about it.

729
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:22.818
Well...

730
00:51:27.432 --> 00:51:28.650
you're my daughter.

731
00:51:31.044 --> 00:51:32.263
So. when are we gonna
start acting

732
00:51:32.437 --> 00:51:33.960
like we care
about each other?

733
00:51:34.134 --> 00:51:35.918
We care about each other.

734
00:51:37.137 --> 00:51:38.182
Show me.

735
00:51:39.966 --> 00:51:41.315
Stop drinking.

736
00:51:46.842 --> 00:51:47.930
Okay.

737
00:51:57.201 --> 00:51:58.941
Promise me
you'll stop drinking.

738
00:52:04.469 --> 00:52:06.253
The only promise
I was able to keep

739
00:52:06.427 --> 00:52:10.083
was the one about
not making any more promises.

740
00:52:36.457 --> 00:52:37.589
I'll try.

741
00:52:42.724 --> 00:52:43.769
Okay?

742
00:53:02.091 --> 00:53:03.180
Here.

743
00:53:05.138 --> 00:53:06.835
The sun will give us
enough electricity?

744
00:53:07.009 --> 00:53:08.576
Guaranteed.

745
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:10.448
And yet you still
don't believe in miracles.

746
00:53:10.622 --> 00:53:11.666
I do not.

747
00:53:13.059 --> 00:53:16.671
Patrick. I believe in science.
You should give it a try.

748
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:19.544
Ah. Jesus on a fucking bike.
it works.

749
00:53:19.718 --> 00:53:20.806
Jackson.

750
00:53:21.763 --> 00:53:23.983
What?
What's wrong with riding a bike?

751
00:53:24.157 --> 00:53:25.289
What do you mean.
"What's wrong?"

752
00:53:25.463 --> 00:53:27.073
I mean.
Jesus doesn't ride a...

753
00:53:28.335 --> 00:53:29.467
a fucking bike.

754
00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:32.209
He rides a-- a good bike.

755
00:53:32.905 --> 00:53:33.993
A nice bike.

756
00:53:35.777 --> 00:53:36.865
What?

757
00:53:37.388 --> 00:53:39.477
You need to work
on your tolerance. padre.

758
00:53:56.407 --> 00:53:58.365
There you go.

759
00:54:00.802 --> 00:54:04.153
What is the good people
from Lo de Marcos owe you?

760
00:54:04.328 --> 00:54:07.548
-Uh. same as you always. Nada.
-Come on. please.

761
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:12.510
-You have a daughter now.
-All right. 50 pesos.

762
00:54:13.598 --> 00:54:14.860
Okay.

763
00:54:18.864 --> 00:54:19.952
100.

764
00:54:21.475 --> 00:54:23.260
Don't spoil me. Patrick.

765
00:54:23.999 --> 00:54:26.045
You know
I don't handle it very well.

766
00:54:30.092 --> 00:54:31.180
Hey.

767
00:54:33.008 --> 00:54:34.358
I'll pray for you.

768
00:54:34.923 --> 00:54:37.796
Eh. pray for them.
I'm good.

769
00:55:37.943 --> 00:55:39.205
Yes!

770
00:55:39.379 --> 00:55:42.077
Yeah!

771
00:55:58.659 --> 00:56:02.794
El Bichos are two and one!

772
00:56:11.063 --> 00:56:12.020
Move. move. move. move!

773
00:56:20.159 --> 00:56:21.769
Who's marking?

774
00:56:35.522 --> 00:56:37.132
That was a tough loss.
ladies.

775
00:56:37.698 --> 00:56:39.352
But. hey.

776
00:56:39.526 --> 00:56:41.920
we're still in contention
for the league final.

777
00:56:42.094 --> 00:56:43.617
And maybe
even the friendship cup.

778
00:56:44.792 --> 00:56:45.837
All right?

779
00:56:56.717 --> 00:57:00.199
Hey. hey. hey.
Uh. only if it's for good luck.

780
00:57:00.373 --> 00:57:02.419
There's no such thing
as luck.

781
00:57:03.028 --> 00:57:04.638
What about my lucky shirt?

782
00:57:08.686 --> 00:57:10.731
Maybe Chilo
will buy you this.

783
00:57:10.905 --> 00:57:13.952
Oh. my God.
This town is too small.

784
00:57:14.518 --> 00:57:16.476
There are no secrets
at the plaza.

785
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:19.174
Only chisme.
Chisme. chisme.

786
00:57:21.089 --> 00:57:22.351
Is Chilo a good guy?

787
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:25.224
He goes to church
and he takes care of his mom.

788
00:57:25.398 --> 00:57:26.443
That matters.

789
00:57:29.097 --> 00:57:31.752
-Is my dad?
-No. he doesn't go to church.

790
00:57:32.057 --> 00:57:34.015
Yeah. but.
I mean. is he a good guy?

791
00:57:36.365 --> 00:57:37.454
He is to me.

792
00:57:37.932 --> 00:57:39.281
You've been good for him.
Marge.

793
00:57:40.761 --> 00:57:43.460
-He's been good for me.
-Is that why he quit drinking?

794
00:57:43.634 --> 00:57:44.765
Well.
I hope that one's for him.

795
00:57:44.939 --> 00:57:46.332
Mm-hmm.

796
00:57:48.116 --> 00:57:49.553
You know what?
I'm gonna miss you.

797
00:57:55.167 --> 00:57:56.647
Yes!

798
00:57:57.474 --> 00:57:58.692
A month ago.

799
00:57:59.824 --> 00:58:01.565
I was a drunk soccer coach.

800
00:58:02.217 --> 00:58:04.611
Hanging out in Mexico
without a peso to my name.

801
00:58:05.264 --> 00:58:07.614
Today.
I'm a single dad.

802
00:58:08.572 --> 00:58:10.748
Hanging out in Mexico
without a peso to my name.

803
00:58:10.922 --> 00:58:14.012
-How does it feel?
-So different.

804
00:58:23.238 --> 00:58:24.370
You gonna be okay?

805
00:58:26.372 --> 00:58:28.113
Yeah. I mean.
I'm gonna miss you like crazy.

806
00:58:28.287 --> 00:58:30.985
but now that I have
a real dad.

807
00:58:31.682 --> 00:58:32.770
it'll be easier.

808
00:58:32.944 --> 00:58:34.989
Hmm. I'm a real dad now. huh?

809
00:58:35.163 --> 00:58:36.513
Sometimes too real.

810
00:58:37.731 --> 00:58:39.124
I'll take that
as a compliment.

811
00:58:40.865 --> 00:58:43.345
Hey. last night.

812
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.522
Let's. uh--
let's take a walk on the beach.

813
00:58:45.696 --> 00:58:47.088
See me a full moon.

814
00:58:48.046 --> 00:58:49.830
I'll show you where I used to
bang my head against it.

815
00:58:50.004 --> 00:58:53.355
Oh. Jeez. Dad. I'm sorry.

816
00:58:54.443 --> 00:58:57.359
It's my last night.
so I told Chilo we would--

817
00:58:58.491 --> 00:58:59.536
Oh.

818
00:59:00.275 --> 00:59:02.016
Okay.

819
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:05.716
Look.
Be careful on your last night.

820
00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:07.282
Especially
if there's a full moon.

821
00:59:07.456 --> 00:59:09.371
Wha--
we're going surfing.

822
00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:11.373
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

823
00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:14.376
Well. you know. you've been
doing a lot of that lately.

824
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:15.595
I just...

825
00:59:17.249 --> 00:59:18.772
I just hope
he's wearing a leash.

826
00:59:18.946 --> 00:59:19.991
-is all I'm--
-Dad.

827
00:59:22.036 --> 00:59:25.170
Sorry.
Just doing my job. kiddo.

828
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:29.478
I won't be late.

829
00:59:30.741 --> 00:59:32.438
Not that
it's any of your business.

830
00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:37.617
Okay.

831
00:59:39.271 --> 00:59:40.359
Have fun.

832
01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.597
Sorry
for being late and stupid.

833
01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.993
Well.
you come by it honestly.

834
01:00:50.168 --> 01:00:53.171
-Good surf?
-Yeah. Made some fun ones.

835
01:00:54.607 --> 01:00:56.348
Yeah. naked surfing

836
01:00:56.522 --> 01:00:58.132
under a full moon...

837
01:00:58.306 --> 01:01:00.047
...is a tradition down here.

838
01:01:00.961 --> 01:01:03.442
And Chilo
is a traditionalist.

839
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:12.407
Uh. when is--
when is the bus?

840
01:01:19.632 --> 01:01:21.634
I want you to keep it. Dad.

841
01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:45.702
Went by fast.
though. didn't it?

842
01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:51.272
It was the best month
of my life.

843
01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:02.893
You know. they're probably
gonna put me in boarding school.

844
01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:07.549
"Sorry. kid. your mom died.
but we have tea times."

845
01:02:19.779 --> 01:02:22.739
I love you. Margie.

846
01:02:33.619 --> 01:02:34.751
Where's the bus?

847
01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.188
Yeah.

848
01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.539
How--

849
01:02:49.026 --> 01:02:50.941
Aw. you know what?

850
01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:55.119
The bus was yesterday.

851
01:02:59.558 --> 01:03:01.473
Yesterday?

852
01:03:01.647 --> 01:03:03.997
Yeah. see.
it's. like. martesis Tuesday.

853
01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:05.433
miércoles is Wednesday.

854
01:03:05.607 --> 01:03:06.652
I always get
the two mixed up.

855
01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:07.871
God.

856
01:03:09.611 --> 01:03:11.004
I wonder how the surf is.

857
01:03:12.919 --> 01:03:14.703
-So. I'm not leaving?
-Not today.

858
01:03:25.236 --> 01:03:26.280
But...

859
01:03:27.978 --> 01:03:30.154
no more naked surfing.

860
01:03:34.854 --> 01:03:35.942
What if
there's a full moon out?

861
01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:38.379
Now. don't. Don't even--

862
01:03:39.598 --> 01:03:40.686
Wait!

863
01:03:41.861 --> 01:03:43.254
Wait. wait. wait--

864
01:03:44.342 --> 01:03:46.997
Wait!

865
01:04:32.346 --> 01:04:36.698
Hey. hey. hey.
hey. hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

866
01:04:37.569 --> 01:04:38.613
What's this?

867
01:04:41.616 --> 01:04:42.966
Well.
this is quite an honor.

868
01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:44.532
Yeah.
Is Azu getting married?

869
01:04:45.098 --> 01:04:46.665
Hmm. Not yet.
She's only 15.

870
01:04:47.144 --> 01:04:48.449
-She's 15?
-Mm-hmm.

871
01:04:48.623 --> 01:04:50.712
I'm older than Azu? Whoa.

872
01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.671
Wow. She's so pretty.

873
01:04:52.845 --> 01:04:56.457
Azucena is inviting you
to her quinceañera.

874
01:04:56.936 --> 01:04:57.894
Her what?

875
01:04:58.068 --> 01:04:59.547
It's a celebration.

876
01:04:59.721 --> 01:05:02.289
as Azucena
is crowned queen of her life.

877
01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:05.423
takes command of her body
and walks into womanhood.

878
01:05:07.164 --> 01:05:09.296
-Is that a translation?
-Word for word.

879
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:12.299
You know. I think that Azu

880
01:05:13.039 --> 01:05:15.172
walked into womanhood
a few miles back.

881
01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:18.218
Well. girls grow up fast
in Mexico.

882
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.056
You know.
my older sister wore this dress

883
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:31.449
to her quince años.

884
01:05:31.623 --> 01:05:32.929
And I wore it to mine.

885
01:05:33.712 --> 01:05:34.756
What about
your little sister?

886
01:05:35.627 --> 01:05:36.976
Well.
she wanted to get married in it.

887
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:38.369
but it didn't fit.

888
01:05:40.414 --> 01:05:41.589
Ah. look who's here.

889
01:05:45.332 --> 01:05:47.552
Quinceañera rule number one.

890
01:05:49.902 --> 01:05:51.904
Never look more beautiful
than the queen.

891
01:05:52.078 --> 01:05:54.820
We broke that rule. big time.

892
01:05:59.085 --> 01:06:00.130
Wow.

893
01:07:27.913 --> 01:07:30.263
And you are the queen
of my life.

894
01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:33.049
How can you know
so soon?

895
01:07:34.311 --> 01:07:35.355
Because I do.

896
01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.474
Hey.

897
01:08:08.736 --> 01:08:09.955
Hey.

898
01:08:10.564 --> 01:08:12.653
Are-- are you gonna
keep your hair like that?

899
01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:14.742
Yes.

900
01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:16.962
All right.

901
01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:25.057
With your permission.
señor.

902
01:08:25.231 --> 01:08:27.146
Stop with the bowing.
Dance.

903
01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:31.063
That's a miracle.

904
01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:32.978
What. that I haven't
killed him yet?

905
01:08:34.022 --> 01:08:35.154
-Vamos.
-No.

906
01:08:35.328 --> 01:08:36.764
-Vamos. vamos.

No. no. no. I'm good.

Uno. dos.
tres. cuatro. cinco.

923
01:10:21.129 --> 01:10:22.914
Your turn!

924
01:10:40.627 --> 01:10:41.759
What-- what's up?

925
01:10:43.456 --> 01:10:45.676
What's up?

926
01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:47.460
No.

927
01:10:47.634 --> 01:10:48.940
Should we tell her?

928
01:10:49.506 --> 01:10:51.290
It's just that...

929
01:10:51.464 --> 01:10:53.205
Chilo sleeps
with all the gringas.

930
01:10:54.946 --> 01:10:55.990
Oh. my God.

931
01:10:57.296 --> 01:10:58.515
I'm so sorry.

932
01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.322
Dad.

933
01:11:24.976 --> 01:11:26.064
Dad!

934
01:11:26.673 --> 01:11:28.458
You were right.
Chilo isn't a good guy.

935
01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:41.906
Wha-- what about Chilo?

936
01:11:42.602 --> 01:11:43.690
Huh?

937
01:11:54.658 --> 01:11:55.963
I'm sorry.

938
01:11:57.182 --> 01:11:59.489
Margie. look.
I've been drinking a long time.

939
01:12:00.272 --> 01:12:02.013
I mean. you don't learn
how to surf in one day.

940
01:12:02.187 --> 01:12:05.321
C'mon. Margie. it's a process.

941
01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:08.193
We had a promise!

942
01:12:09.716 --> 01:12:11.762
And you broke it.

943
01:12:17.245 --> 01:12:19.987
You know.
Mom was right about you.

944
01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:24.035
I shouldn't have come.

945
01:13:00.158 --> 01:13:02.508
My dad started drinking again.

946
01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:36.020
Where is she?

947
01:13:38.457 --> 01:13:39.545
Are you still drunk?

948
01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:42.679
You hurt my daughter.

949
01:13:45.377 --> 01:13:46.422
And you didn't?

950
01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:04.265
So. are all men assholes?

951
01:14:06.485 --> 01:14:08.139
Mi abuela will think so.

952
01:14:13.274 --> 01:14:15.929
I can't say. though.
I've never had a boyfriend.

953
01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:18.802
-You're a virgin?
-Of course I am.

954
01:14:18.976 --> 01:14:20.543
-Come on!
-I am.

955
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.329
Oh. but if someone
is special. yes.

956
01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:27.941
If I'm getting married one day.
of course.

957
01:14:29.247 --> 01:14:30.770
But until then.

958
01:14:30.944 --> 01:14:31.945
local guys can do it
with the gringas.

959
01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:33.164
I don't care.

960
01:14:37.429 --> 01:14:38.474
I'm sorry.

961
01:14:39.779 --> 01:14:40.824
No. I deserve it.

962
01:14:41.302 --> 01:14:42.739
I was stupid.

963
01:14:42.913 --> 01:14:43.914
Oye.

964
01:14:44.088 --> 01:14:46.307
Weak. Not stupid.

965
01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:50.181
A little bit stupid.

966
01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.055
A little bit. yes.

967
01:14:59.146 --> 01:15:01.235
-Hey.
-I have nothing to say to you.

968
01:15:01.409 --> 01:15:02.498
No. It's Margie.

969
01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:05.022
She ran away.

970
01:15:05.762 --> 01:15:08.068
She must be trying
to get back across the border.

971
01:15:10.157 --> 01:15:11.724
I don't know what to do.

972
01:15:15.162 --> 01:15:16.294
I don't know.

973
01:16:08.955 --> 01:16:10.000
Get in.

974
01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:14.613
You're gonna need this.

975
01:16:15.919 --> 01:16:16.963
Let's go find her.

976
01:16:30.977 --> 01:16:33.501
Be brief.
don't tell them too much.

977
01:16:33.676 --> 01:16:34.851
and they will let you pass.

978
01:16:35.025 --> 01:16:36.287
Okay?

979
01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:38.028
Thank you
for being so kind to me.

980
01:16:43.424 --> 01:16:44.512
Bye.

981
01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:48.473
Oh. and. Marge.

982
01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.345
Smile.

983
01:16:59.179 --> 01:17:00.267
Country of birth?

984
01:17:00.877 --> 01:17:04.141
-America.
-Uh. North. South. Central?

985
01:17:04.315 --> 01:17:06.491
Um. North.

986
01:17:07.274 --> 01:17:09.929
-Canada?
-Uh. no. The United States.

987
01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.671
Okay. Passport.

988
01:17:15.369 --> 01:17:17.067
Oh. I don't have one.

989
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:18.938
Uh. you need one.
I'm sorry.

990
01:17:19.112 --> 01:17:20.897
Well. when I came to Mexico.
um. I didn't need one.

991
01:17:21.071 --> 01:17:22.507
And I'm American.

992
01:17:22.986 --> 01:17:24.901
Right.
Well. they don't check. we do.

993
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:27.338
Do you have
other documents?

994
01:17:27.512 --> 01:17:29.514
Well.
you're undocumented. amiga.

995
01:17:30.036 --> 01:17:31.777
-Um...
-Next.

996
01:17:40.743 --> 01:17:42.614
-Azu.
-What are you doing here?

997
01:17:42.788 --> 01:17:45.225
-They wouldn't let me in.
-But why? You're an American.

998
01:17:45.399 --> 01:17:46.966
An undocumented one.
apparently.

999
01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.620
Welcome to my world.

1000
01:17:52.798 --> 01:17:53.843
Follow me.

1001
01:18:12.035 --> 01:18:15.081
Hey. We are fine.
But it's not cheap.

1002
01:18:15.255 --> 01:18:17.127
-It's 1.000.
-Pesos?

1003
01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:19.390
Dollars.

1004
01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:32.751
Okay.

1005
01:18:34.274 --> 01:18:35.319
Okay.

1006
01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:41.107
This is the longest
of long shots. man.

1007
01:18:41.281 --> 01:18:42.587
And that's a miracle.

1008
01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:46.199
We're looking for your daughter
and you're sober.

1009
01:18:46.373 --> 01:18:48.898
-Yeah. barely.
-Barely a miracle?

1010
01:18:49.072 --> 01:18:50.247
Barely sober.

1011
01:18:50.769 --> 01:18:53.163
You need to be thankful
for the smallest gift.

1012
01:18:53.946 --> 01:18:54.947
Trust me.

1013
01:18:55.818 --> 01:18:57.907
And him.

1014
01:18:58.081 --> 01:19:00.257
Man.
you make atheism hard.

1015
01:19:00.431 --> 01:19:03.042
Dude. that's what I do
for a living.

1016
01:19:17.622 --> 01:19:19.102
Uh. the ring.

1017
01:19:19.276 --> 01:19:20.364
Oh.

1018
01:19:27.066 --> 01:19:28.067
Okay.

1019
01:19:36.249 --> 01:19:37.729
I haven't lived long enough

1020
01:19:37.903 --> 01:19:39.600
to do
a lot of stupid shit.

1021
01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:42.952
if you don't count tracking down
my loser dad in Mexico.

1022
01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:44.997
But following a psycho
into the desert...

1023
01:19:45.171 --> 01:19:47.260
...gotta top my list.

1024
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:02.798
Oh. it's lunchtime.

1025
01:20:23.383 --> 01:20:26.125
No!

1026
01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:37.006
-Help!
-Hey!

1027
01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:40.357
Now come on!

1028
01:20:45.318 --> 01:20:48.017
-Wait! Wait!
-No. no. no. no. don't!

1029
01:21:18.569 --> 01:21:20.092
Oh. come on.

1030
01:21:20.266 --> 01:21:22.312
Are you good?

1031
01:21:23.356 --> 01:21:24.705
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1032
01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:25.924
Okay.

1033
01:21:27.012 --> 01:21:28.057
There's the highway.

1034
01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:29.928
We're close.

1035
01:21:34.802 --> 01:21:36.108
-Morning. gentlemen.
-Good morning. sir.

1036
01:21:36.282 --> 01:21:37.327
Passports. please.

1037
01:21:38.197 --> 01:21:39.242
And. uh...

1038
01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:40.896
where are you guys from?

1039
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:42.680
San Diego. California.

1040
01:21:43.028 --> 01:21:44.377
Bakersfield. California.

1041
01:21:45.291 --> 01:21:46.336
What?

1042
01:21:47.293 --> 01:21:49.382
-What?
-You're from Bakersfield?

1043
01:21:50.166 --> 01:21:51.254
Yes.

1044
01:21:51.776 --> 01:21:52.908
I'm an anchor baby.

1045
01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.040
My parents got deported
when I was a kid.

1046
01:21:55.214 --> 01:21:56.737
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
I get the whole thing.

1047
01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.957
But you never told me
you're from Bakersfield.

1048
01:21:59.131 --> 01:22:00.654
-Yes. I did.
-No.

1049
01:22:00.828 --> 01:22:02.439
If you told me
that you were from Bakersfield.

1050
01:22:02.613 --> 01:22:03.875
I would have said.
"Yeah. he's from Bakersfield."

1051
01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:05.224
Gentlemen.

1052
01:22:05.398 --> 01:22:06.443
Oh. thank you. sir.

1053
01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:09.750
-We had breakfast this time...
-We've never had breakfast.

1054
01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.230
-...and then we talked--
-Guys!

1055
01:22:11.404 --> 01:22:12.405
-Oh. I'm sorry.
-Let's keep it going.

1056
01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.370
Dr. Foster.
please come to the ER.

1057
01:22:20.544 --> 01:22:22.328
Dr. Foster to the ER.

1058
01:22:38.388 --> 01:22:40.259
Bueno.Azucena?

1059
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.089
-Sí. sí.
-Hey!

1060
01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:05.676
-Marge Bickford?
-Yeah.

1061
01:23:06.546 --> 01:23:10.159
Your bloodwork is normal.
but you're very dehydrated.

1062
01:23:11.029 --> 01:23:12.074
What happened?

1063
01:23:13.118 --> 01:23:14.163
Football injury.

1064
01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:17.253
Rough game.

1065
01:23:18.123 --> 01:23:19.559
Let's take care
of your eye.

1066
01:23:37.534 --> 01:23:38.622
You sure
you don't want to stay?

1067
01:23:39.666 --> 01:23:40.972
Totally and completely sure.

1068
01:23:41.581 --> 01:23:42.756
But you're here.

1069
01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:44.628
It could be so hard
to get back in.

1070
01:23:45.933 --> 01:23:48.153
You know who thinks everyone
wants to live in America?

1071
01:23:48.806 --> 01:23:50.721
Americans.

1072
01:23:52.157 --> 01:23:54.203
Now. it's fine
to be the neighbor.

1073
01:23:54.377 --> 01:23:55.856
And I'll keep
an eye on you

1074
01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.336
while you're keeping an eye
on your dad.

1075
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:59.556
-I've given up on him.
-Don't.

1076
01:24:00.557 --> 01:24:02.167
He hasn't given up on you.

1077
01:24:02.341 --> 01:24:03.429
Yeah. well.
it sure feels like he has.

1078
01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:09.131
What is he doing here?

1079
01:24:11.089 --> 01:24:12.134
I called.

1080
01:24:13.874 --> 01:24:15.702
Azu.
you should have asked me.

1081
01:24:15.876 --> 01:24:17.095
He was amazingly
not there for me

1082
01:24:17.269 --> 01:24:18.357
when I needed him.

1083
01:24:19.619 --> 01:24:21.099
He's new
at being your dad.

1084
01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:27.671
Be kind.

1085
01:24:54.872 --> 01:24:56.656
I'm gonna need you. Dad.

1086
01:25:01.183 --> 01:25:02.227
I'm here.

1087
01:25:04.882 --> 01:25:05.970
Come on.

1088
01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:07.798
Let's go home.

1089
01:25:22.595 --> 01:25:23.727
Jackson.

1090
01:25:24.945 --> 01:25:27.383
Los Bichos are going to
the friendship cup in Tijuana.

1091
01:25:27.557 --> 01:25:29.080
Let me see that.

1092
01:25:29.254 --> 01:25:31.604
We've been selected
as Nayarit state team.

1093
01:25:31.778 --> 01:25:32.997
What's it say?

1094
01:25:36.043 --> 01:25:38.002
-Yeah. I know. In English.
-We're going to Tijuana.

1095
01:25:38.176 --> 01:25:39.090
-That's it.
-Okay. cool.

1096
01:25:39.264 --> 01:25:40.352
Let's go tell them.

1097
01:26:11.383 --> 01:26:14.430
!Bichos. Bichos!

1098
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:52.859
Gracias. Padre.

1099
01:26:59.953 --> 01:27:02.217
I told you.

1100
01:27:02.826 --> 01:27:03.914
Come on. guys.

1101
01:27:04.088 --> 01:27:05.307
Look sharp.

1102
01:27:08.048 --> 01:27:09.180
Is that Lem?

1103
01:27:10.050 --> 01:27:11.313
Is that Large Marge?

1104
01:27:12.749 --> 01:27:15.404
No. it can't be.
Her ass isn't big enough.

1105
01:27:17.362 --> 01:27:19.669
Sure looks like her.
but-- but she looks good.

1106
01:27:19.843 --> 01:27:21.540
I thought
these guys were from Mexico.

1107
01:27:21.714 --> 01:27:22.889
They're supposed to be.

1108
01:27:23.542 --> 01:27:25.196
Lem's dad lives in Mexico.

1109
01:27:25.892 --> 01:27:28.068
Jackson Bickford was the best
soccer player I've ever seen.

1110
01:27:28.547 --> 01:27:29.983
All instinct. no restraint.

1111
01:27:30.723 --> 01:27:32.029
Looks like he's
El Bicho's coach.

1112
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:34.771
Y'all need to
level up today. girls.

1113
01:27:35.598 --> 01:27:37.948
Go. Get out there.
Go. warm up. Let's go.

1114
01:27:38.557 --> 01:27:39.602
Come on.

1115
01:28:40.489 --> 01:28:41.533
You already won.

1116
01:28:44.231 --> 01:28:45.320
Have fun.

1117
01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:08.865
Move it over!

1118
01:29:09.866 --> 01:29:11.824
She's open. pass!

1119
01:29:14.261 --> 01:29:15.350
Yeah!

1120
01:29:22.879 --> 01:29:24.837
Attagirl. that was goal!

1121
01:29:29.668 --> 01:29:30.713
I'm back.

1122
01:29:40.592 --> 01:29:43.160
No. no.
No. no. no. no. no. no!

1123
01:29:43.334 --> 01:29:45.075
Yes!

1124
01:29:48.426 --> 01:29:50.428
-All right.
-Good job. ladies!

1125
01:29:53.126 --> 01:29:54.911
Let's go back.
Come on. Hurry up!

1126
01:29:59.959 --> 01:30:01.918
Let's go!

1127
01:30:04.094 --> 01:30:05.617
Come on. Get on her!

1128
01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:06.879
Let's go. ladies.

1129
01:30:10.883 --> 01:30:13.408
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1130
01:30:14.104 --> 01:30:15.192
Fuck!

1131
01:30:18.238 --> 01:30:20.110
-Feels good. Huh?
-Yeah.

1132
01:30:23.983 --> 01:30:26.072
Rápido. Come on.
Go. go. go. go. go!

1133
01:30:26.246 --> 01:30:28.205
Hey! Hey!

1134
01:30:28.379 --> 01:30:30.599
Unbelievable!

1135
01:30:30.773 --> 01:30:31.861
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. don't worry.

1136
01:30:32.035 --> 01:30:34.472
Okay. okay. okay. okay.

1137
01:30:34.646 --> 01:30:36.692
Come on. guys!

1138
01:30:37.257 --> 01:30:38.563
Come on. kid. come on!

1139
01:30:54.536 --> 01:30:57.582
Gringa. Gringa!

1140
01:31:02.021 --> 01:31:05.547
!Bichos. Bichos!

1141
01:31:29.353 --> 01:31:31.616
-Hey.
-Hey.

1142
01:31:33.139 --> 01:31:35.881
So. you beat your old team?

1143
01:31:36.534 --> 01:31:37.753
Yeah.

1144
01:31:38.231 --> 01:31:39.494
Well. how does that
make you feel?

1145
01:31:42.714 --> 01:31:43.759
This feels bigger.

1146
01:31:45.978 --> 01:31:47.066
Good answer.

1147
01:32:03.779 --> 01:32:04.823
We are here...

1148
01:32:06.433 --> 01:32:07.957
because of God's grace.

1149
01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:10.220
and the promise

1150
01:32:10.394 --> 01:32:13.440
that Marge Bickford
will be remembered well.

1151
01:32:15.268 --> 01:32:16.356
Humility...

1152
01:32:17.619 --> 01:32:18.707
and forgiveness

1153
01:32:19.577 --> 01:32:20.709
are the gifts

1154
01:32:21.623 --> 01:32:23.059
we leave to our children.

1155
01:32:25.104 --> 01:32:26.149
Rest in peace.

1156
01:32:29.761 --> 01:32:30.806
Jackson.

1157
01:32:38.901 --> 01:32:41.556
"Marge and I came here
on our honeymoon.

1158
01:32:42.339 --> 01:32:43.732
Back when
we were so in love.

1159
01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:53.263
When life looked easy.

1160
01:32:57.441 --> 01:32:58.485
And everything...

1161
01:32:59.748 --> 01:33:01.314
was still out
in front of us.

1162
01:33:06.755 --> 01:33:10.280
It's the only
place that I've ever felt whole.

1163
01:33:14.632 --> 01:33:15.720
Which is..."

1164
01:33:16.329 --> 01:33:17.592
Sorry. It's hard.

1165
01:33:17.766 --> 01:33:19.985
"...which is why..."

1166
01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:22.292
Come here.

1167
01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:31.649
"Which is why...

1168
01:33:32.650 --> 01:33:33.738
I came back here.

1169
01:33:35.087 --> 01:33:36.741
I need
to thank Marge for that.

1170
01:33:38.438 --> 01:33:39.788
And her daughter

1171
01:33:39.962 --> 01:33:42.138
for all the love
I'm feeling right now."

1172
01:33:51.713 --> 01:33:55.238
Mom would have loved
you're with me here right now.

1173
01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:59.634
She never stopped
trying to make my life better.

1174
01:34:00.896 --> 01:34:02.898
And all of a sudden...

1175
01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.248
it is.

1176
01:34:10.732 --> 01:34:11.776
Um...

1177
01:34:35.539 --> 01:34:36.627
I love you.

1178
01:34:38.237 --> 01:34:39.325
I know.

1179
01:35:24.196 --> 01:35:25.720
-Thank you.
-There you go. baby.

1180
01:35:25.894 --> 01:35:29.288
-Mm. Delicious.
-Oh. forgot the knife.

1181
01:35:31.203 --> 01:35:33.162
It's your daughter. again.

1182
01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:36.643
Hey. kid.

1183
01:35:36.818 --> 01:35:38.167
-Hi. Dad.
-Say "hi."

1184
01:35:38.341 --> 01:35:40.473
-Oh. hi. Elsa.
-Hi.

1185
01:35:41.126 --> 01:35:44.347
-How you doing?
-Oh. uh. yeah. I'm okay.

1186
01:35:44.521 --> 01:35:47.132
-I just really miss you.
-Good. You're supposed to.

1187
01:35:47.698 --> 01:35:49.221
But I'm here.

1188
01:35:49.395 --> 01:35:51.702
-Here.
-Oh. man. I'm jealous.

1189
01:35:51.876 --> 01:35:55.097
-Thanks for getting Internet.
-Oh. no worries.

1190
01:35:55.271 --> 01:35:56.881
I actually kind of
like the machine.

1191
01:35:57.055 --> 01:35:58.535
-Huh.
-Hey.

1192
01:35:59.666 --> 01:36:01.016
You're gonna do
great up there.

1193
01:36:01.190 --> 01:36:02.452
When are you gonna come up?

1194
01:36:02.626 --> 01:36:04.149
-Thanksgiving.
-Wha--

1195
01:36:04.323 --> 01:36:05.803
Thanksgiving?
That's. like. a month away.

1196
01:36:05.977 --> 01:36:07.544
Remember. months go fast.

1197
01:36:07.718 --> 01:36:09.589
Yeah. Okay.

1198
01:36:10.503 --> 01:36:11.940
Bye.

1199
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:19.295
Hey. um.

1200
01:36:19.469 --> 01:36:21.384
you're that hotshot futbolista
on that full ride.

1201
01:36:22.124 --> 01:36:23.734
Uh. maybe.

1202
01:36:23.908 --> 01:36:26.302
I'm the hotshot Mexicano
on that full ride. too.

1203
01:36:26.476 --> 01:36:28.695
-Um. mucho gusto.
-Mucho gusto.

1204
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:30.523
-Fernando.
-Marge.

1205
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:32.961
You played for Los Bichos.

1206
01:36:33.135 --> 01:36:34.397
Yeah. I did.

1207
01:36:34.571 --> 01:36:35.877
