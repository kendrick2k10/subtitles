00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.404
I don't love you anymore. Rome.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.277
What?

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.845
What happened to 'I want
to be with you forever'?

8
00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:22.935
You said that to me last
night. I specifically remember.

9
00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:26.026
I want to be with you. forever.

10
00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.028
[bell chiming]

11
00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:31.161
Forever is only a word.

12
00:00:32.684 --> 00:00:34.425
You could say that
about anything.

13
00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:36.340
What?

14
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.125
'Forever is only a word.' you
could say that about anything.

15
00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.344
Words are used to signify
things and concepts.

16
00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:42.912
that's the entire
purpose of language.

17
00:00:42.912 --> 00:00:43.869
And forever is forever.

18
00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:45.349
Whatever.

19
00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:46.829
See. anytime I
try to talk to you

20
00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.874
you turn into some
philosophical discourse.

21
00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:50.833
Because you're saying things
that don't make any sense

22
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:53.575
- so I have to-- - I don't
love you anymore. Rome.

23
00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:55.055
Is that clear enough for you.

24
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.536
or do I need to justify
it. with a proof?

25
00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:00.408
Fucking bitch.

26
00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:02.540
Ow man. I'm supporting you and--

27
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.021
See. this I
psychological warfare.

28
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:06.588
Look dude. she didn't
mean what she said

29
00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:07.545
in the creative room. okay?

30
00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:08.372
She was--

31
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.158
She was stressed.

32
00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:12.681
I didn't mean what I said
in the creative room.

33
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.074
I was stressed.

34
00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.598
I do love you. forever.

35
00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.775
[Rome panting]

36
00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:23.387
[Leo] And now she broke
up with you again.

37
00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:26.738
Yeah.

38
00:01:26.738 --> 00:01:28.523
Tell her you don't want
to fight anymore man.

39
00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:31.091
Said things you don't
believe out of desperation.

40
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.918
which is only a form of love.

41
00:01:32.918 --> 00:01:34.137
Armando. fuck off.

42
00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:35.356
You don't know shit about women.

43
00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:37.488
I fucked my cousin.

44
00:01:37.488 --> 00:01:39.316
Like. cousin's cousin.

45
00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:41.666
I hope.

46
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:42.537
Nah. check it out.

47
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:45.757
[footsteps thumping]

48
00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:47.890
Jesus. this girl's banging!

49
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.413
Did you see this?

50
00:01:49.413 --> 00:01:51.415
I'm sorry. I take back
what I said. great job.

51
00:01:51.415 --> 00:01:54.505
[upbeat music]

52
00:02:02.992 --> 00:02:04.602
[singing in Italian]

53
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.361
I want your dick.

54
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.278
She wants my dick.

55
00:03:11.278 --> 00:03:12.844
I'll be honest man.

56
00:03:12.844 --> 00:03:14.411
I don't think she's
remotely interested--

57
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:15.586
Or maybe she said I
like Charles Dickens

58
00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:16.761
but. you know. same shit.

59
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:18.154
Yeah. it's very different.

60
00:03:18.154 --> 00:03:18.981
Come.

61
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.679
It's a four bedroom villa.

62
00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:23.203
but we've only
rented three rooms.

63
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.422
Two of the rooms
have one big bed.

64
00:03:25.422 --> 00:03:27.119
- the other room has two
small beds-- - Wait wait wait.

65
00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:28.120
Wait. wait.

66
00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:30.514
Keep up. asshole.

67
00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:31.950
You designed this because.

68
00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:34.910
why would you design this?

69
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.955
What else am I supposed to
do for Architectural Design?

70
00:03:36.955 --> 00:03:38.827
Freaking jerk off class.

71
00:03:38.827 --> 00:03:41.743
So originally. you were gonna
share a bed with Amber Jane.

72
00:03:41.743 --> 00:03:44.615
Claire and Katrina would have
their own room sharing a bed

73
00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:46.965
'cause. girls are
cool with that.

74
00:03:46.965 --> 00:03:49.533
And I was gonna have to share
a room with Unremarkable Dan.

75
00:03:50.447 --> 00:03:52.275
[pizzicato music]

76
00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:55.670
But. one or two days into
the trip. three tops.

77
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.673
after a steady infusion
of Aperol Spritz.

78
00:03:58.673 --> 00:04:01.850
the Mediterranean sun
slightly swelling our lips.

79
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.895
and Claire realizing
how compatible we are

80
00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:06.507
when she girdles my rib cage
on the back of my Vespa.

81
00:04:07.986 --> 00:04:09.336
I was gonna shack
up with Claire.

82
00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:11.251
And Katrina and Unremarkable Dan

83
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.122
would have to share the room
with the two little beds.

84
00:04:13.122 --> 00:04:14.254
Yeah. no. no.

85
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.777
I'm pretty creeped out by this.

86
00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:18.258
You've got us living
in like a little house.

87
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.564
with a little kitchen.
little washer. dryer--

88
00:04:20.564 --> 00:04:22.174
The assignment was
to draw an apartment.

89
00:04:22.174 --> 00:04:23.785
I couldn't just
draw three rooms.

90
00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:25.743
It's a mini kitchen. sack up.

91
00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:28.137
So you showed this
to Miss. Polotzi.

92
00:04:28.137 --> 00:04:29.791
with our names on the beds?

93
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:31.793
Do you understand
that were Seniors

94
00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:33.490
and no one gives a fuck?

95
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.883
[Rome] What grade
did she give you?

96
00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:36.450
She hasn't given me a grade yet.

97
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.278
She says we need to
have a serious talk.

98
00:04:39.757 --> 00:04:41.977
Can you focus. do
you see the problem?

99
00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:44.501
Now Amber Jane's
gonna hog Claire

100
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:46.634
'cause she's a fucking bitch.

101
00:04:46.634 --> 00:04:48.679
Katrina and Unremarkable
Dan are gonna take the room

102
00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:50.464
with the two little beds.

103
00:04:50.464 --> 00:04:52.640
And you and I are gonna
have to share a big bed.

104
00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:56.165
Which means...

105
00:04:56.165 --> 00:04:58.254
[exhales] I'll never get
to sleep with Claire.

106
00:04:58.254 --> 00:05:00.300
Listen. if Claire really
wants to sleep with you.

107
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.390
which I guarantee you she
doesn't. looking at this.

108
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.957
you could manage to
find a place to do it.

109
00:05:07.132 --> 00:05:09.047
I guess that's true.

110
00:05:09.047 --> 00:05:11.615
[triumphant music]

111
00:05:40.644 --> 00:05:41.819
[sighs]

112
00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.386
Thanks. Rome.

113
00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:44.256
No worries.

114
00:05:45.693 --> 00:05:49.218

116
00:05:57.922 --> 00:05:59.359
Did you understand?

117
00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.577
No. no way man.

118
00:06:00.577 --> 00:06:02.405
If it has half a tank of gas.

119
00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:04.015
which I'm gonna check right now.

120
00:06:04.015 --> 00:06:05.843
then we're returning it
with half a tank of gas.

121
00:06:05.843 --> 00:06:06.801
Whatever.

122
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.159
[engine whirring]

123
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.381
See you guys at the villa.
a little later though.

124
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.512
[engine accelerating]

125
00:06:22.512 --> 00:06:24.514
Who the fuck is that?

126
00:06:24.514 --> 00:06:26.690
That's just some guy we
met during Spring Break.

127
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.866
All right familia.
let's do this.

128
00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:31.695
Unremarkable Dan. feel free to
contribute to this vacation.

129
00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:32.783
I can't wait to pregame.

130
00:06:32.783 --> 00:06:35.699
Yes! Paradoxically.

131
00:06:37.092 --> 00:06:38.659
the pregame is the
best part of the night.

132
00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:39.834
Yeah. but you can't
go in knowing that.

133
00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:41.444
otherwise it's not a pregame.

134
00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:43.620
It is a paradox.

I need to get one of those.

138

[pizzicato music]
Welcome to Villa Luna Bianca.

139
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:22.354
Where's the rest of the group?

140
00:07:22.354 --> 00:07:24.661
You said three
girls. three guys.

141
00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:27.969
Katrina decided she was sick
this morning and couldn't come.

142
00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:29.710
And she's the only
reason he's here.

143
00:07:30.885 --> 00:07:32.669
[birds chirping]

144
00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:37.108
Listen. I don't give a
fuck about that story.

145
00:07:37.108 --> 00:07:40.851
I know you kids. first you
bring in the "small group."

146
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:45.116
the "reconnaissance team." with
the unintimidating fucktard.

147
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.554
And once I leave.

148
00:07:47.554 --> 00:07:50.687
you try to sneak in
four more people.

149
00:07:50.687 --> 00:07:52.472
[pizzicato music]

150
00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:58.695
I have cameras all over this
villa. so don't fuck around.

151
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.961
If I see you sneak into
the downstairs bedroom.

152
00:08:03.961 --> 00:08:07.051
I will literally
fuck you in the ass.

153
00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:09.010
If you pass out
in the tree house.

154
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.491
you will wake up with
my dick in your ass.

155
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.754
Anyone else disturbed by this?

156
00:08:13.754 --> 00:08:15.669
Oh. thanks for joining. Dan.

157
00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:17.497
What d'you mean?

158
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.368
[Schmae] I'll come by and
serve breakfast on the terrace.

159
00:08:19.368 --> 00:08:21.239
from 7 to 8.

160
00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:25.766
Brioche. coffee. cappuccino.
fresh fruit from my garden

161
00:08:26.854 --> 00:08:28.682
and pancakes upon request.

162
00:08:28.682 --> 00:08:32.555
If you come at 7:59. it's
fine. 8:01. fuck off.

163
00:08:32.555 --> 00:08:35.689
Have a little
respect. Jesus fuck.

164
00:08:35.689 --> 00:08:36.864
Any questions?

165
00:08:36.864 --> 00:08:39.170
Yeah. where can we buy alcohol?

166
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.608
This is Villa Luna
Bianca. bitch.

167
00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:44.393
Sorry. I didn't mean
to call you a bitch.

168
00:08:44.393 --> 00:08:48.615
I meant the festive.
universal festive "bitch."

169
00:08:48.615 --> 00:08:50.007
The villa's fully stocked.

170
00:08:50.007 --> 00:08:51.792
It's all included in the price.

171
00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:54.490
Speaking of. do
you have the cash?

172
00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:59.843
[cash crinkling]

173
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.325
I have mixed feelings about
what's happening here.

174
00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:04.544
[sly music]

175
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.328
See you tomorrow
between 7 and 8.

[engine whirring]

178
00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:15.380
1. 2. 3. 4 guys. you're
trying to fuck me.

179
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.860
How many people?

180
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.688
No. no. no. this is
just um. this is just...

181
00:09:19.907 --> 00:09:20.951
Who are you?

182
00:09:20.951 --> 00:09:21.952
I'm Leonardo.

183
00:09:21.952 --> 00:09:23.214
[Leo] Like me.

184
00:09:23.214 --> 00:09:24.389
Romulus.

185
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:26.391
Ah. like Romulus and Remus.

186
00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:27.567
Don't worry I'm
not sleeping here.

187
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.046
I'm only dropping off Aubergine.

188
00:09:29.046 --> 00:09:31.309
[Schmae] Cameras
all over this villa.

189
00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:32.920
Rome here is also Italian.

190
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.399
you should both
speak in Italian.

191
00:09:35.749 --> 00:09:36.924
Come on. you're
always telling people

192
00:09:36.924 --> 00:09:37.925
at school that you're Italian.

193
00:09:39.274 --> 00:09:40.928
- Just an eighth.
- Diluted.

194
00:09:40.928 --> 00:09:43.452
Like the pale moonlight.
or Aperol Spritz.

195
00:09:43.452 --> 00:09:45.846
The best things in
life are a subtle mix.

196
00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:50.720
Hey. do you know where
I can rent one of these?

197
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.288
Oh no. not this.

198
00:09:53.288 --> 00:09:55.290
Something similar maybe.

199
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.118
- This is the villa?
- [Leonardo] Not the same.

200
00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:59.381
This place sucks. it's
like an eighth of a villa.

201
00:09:59.381 --> 00:10:01.731
But you can borrow
this one. tomorrow.

202
00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:03.646
Meet me at La Sirena at 9?

203
00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:04.691
Okay. great.

204
00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:05.692
[engine starting]

205
00:10:07.084 --> 00:10:08.433
[engine accelerating]

206
00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:11.872
[Rome] What?

207
00:10:11.872 --> 00:10:13.700
What?

208
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.179
Dude. you're going Vespa
riding with Leonardo. he's--

209
00:10:15.179 --> 00:10:16.703
- [Leo] Romeo. relax...
- He's trying to--

210
00:10:16.703 --> 00:10:18.966
The whole Vespa thing
is purely self serving.

211
00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:20.576
Yeah. I'm gonna use it.

212
00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:22.099
I'm also gonna find
out who this guy is.

213
00:10:22.099 --> 00:10:23.623
I mean. who the
fuck is Leonardo?

214
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.189
Why is he so cozy
with your girl?

215
00:10:29.106 --> 00:10:30.586
That was some
pretty good acting.

216
00:10:32.414 --> 00:10:34.677
You know for a second there
I thought you were kind of...

217
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.505
smitten with him.

218
00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:40.248
Don't even bring him
up tonight. be cool.

219
00:10:40.248 --> 00:10:41.684
Let me investigate.

220
00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:43.686
[tense music]

221
00:10:43.686 --> 00:10:45.906
[Narrator] Since Amber
Jane broke up with Rome.

222
00:10:45.906 --> 00:10:49.083
everyone knew he'd be
a mopey little bitch.

223
00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:53.087
But the boys could fix that
at the bar. This however...

224
00:10:53.087 --> 00:10:55.263
[Rome] So uh. where
did you meet Leonardo?

225
00:10:55.263 --> 00:10:56.090
Spring Break.

226
00:10:57.221 --> 00:10:59.049
Cool.

227
00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:01.922
I think it was that night
when you passed out at 5:12pm.

228
00:11:01.922 --> 00:11:04.664
[birds chirping]

229
00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:08.406
[whimsical music]

230
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.671
Yeah. it was that night.

231
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.369
We met when Claire
and I went dancing.

232
00:11:14.369 --> 00:11:17.241
Do you have a
problem. with dancing?

233
00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:19.809
No. I was just [clears
throat] wondering.

234
00:11:19.809 --> 00:11:22.072
since-- how he knew
where to pick you up.

235
00:11:22.072 --> 00:11:25.815
Well he's a friend. so
friends talk. message.

236
00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:27.469
Oh. so you're sending
him letters as well.

237
00:11:27.469 --> 00:11:29.514
No one sends letters. Rome.

238
00:11:29.514 --> 00:11:31.081
Only you with your
stupid typewriter

239
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:33.780
think you're so
artistic. you're not.

240
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.870
So you've been calling
Leonardo with your phone.

241
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.828
We message each other online.

242
00:11:38.828 --> 00:11:40.221
What's the big deal?

243
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:42.876
And yeah. now we text.

244
00:11:42.876 --> 00:11:44.486
What's the big deal?

245
00:11:44.486 --> 00:11:46.314
You're messaging some
sleazy Italian guy while

246
00:11:46.314 --> 00:11:49.709
you hijack my phone in the name
of some technological detox.

247
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:53.190
While you message him. and
tell me that you still love me.

248
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.192
Again. undermining my love.

249
00:11:55.192 --> 00:11:58.456
I wasted so much
time on you. Rome.

250
00:11:58.456 --> 00:12:01.068
I gave you everything
for four years

251
00:12:01.068 --> 00:12:03.113
and you don't even realize it.

252
00:12:03.113 --> 00:12:05.072
And I didn't use my phone.

253
00:12:05.072 --> 00:12:07.596
I didn't touch it
until we broke up.

254
00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:10.512
Yeah. we broke up.

255
00:12:10.512 --> 00:12:12.427
So stop harassing me.

256
00:12:12.427 --> 00:12:15.430
I didn't violate the detox. I
messaged him on the computer.

257
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.738
Do you even understand how
stupid what you just said is?

258
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.957
Or do you need Siri to
define technology for you?

259
00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:23.917
I can't stand you.

260
00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:29.052
Technically a typewriter is--

261
00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:31.054
Dan. I will fuck you in the
asshole on this tree house

262
00:12:31.054 --> 00:12:33.622
till you pass out and wake up
with another dick in your ass!

263
00:12:33.622 --> 00:12:35.537
Tact. Dan. tact!

264
00:12:35.537 --> 00:12:38.714
Listen. let's go down the
bar. talk everything out.

265
00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:41.369
Dan. sorry I exploded just
now. you can come too.

266
00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:42.805
Am I a terrible person?

267
00:12:42.805 --> 00:12:45.590
No buddy. it's way
more complex than that.

268
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.157
Let's go talk it out.

269
00:12:47.157 --> 00:12:49.246
First. let's get out
of this tree house.

270
00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:51.553
I don't think I'm
gonna come tonight.

271
00:12:51.553 --> 00:12:55.252
I'm gonna take it easy
and just pace myself.

272
00:12:57.037 --> 00:12:59.039
[dreamy music] [Leo] It's a
five day fucking vacation.

273
00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:00.997
you don't have to pace yourself.

274
00:13:00.997 --> 00:13:01.998
[Leo] Hey. hey.

275
00:13:01.998 --> 00:13:02.999
[Geoffrey] You're back!

276
00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:04.087
Of course we're back.

277
00:13:04.087 --> 00:13:05.393
I told you we'd be back.

278
00:13:05.393 --> 00:13:07.830
That's right Senior Slack baby.

279
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.223
Hi. I'm Rome.

280
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:11.616
You don't remember me?

281
00:13:13.183 --> 00:13:15.664
We went free-diving together.

282
00:13:15.664 --> 00:13:18.406
[gentle music]
[seagulls chirping]

283
00:13:21.452 --> 00:13:23.672
You fucking made me go sea
glass searching with you.

00:13:25.282 --> 00:13:28.024
[gentle music]

285
00:13:28.024 --> 00:13:31.158
Damn. I guess I was pretty
hammered that entire trip.

286
00:13:31.158 --> 00:13:33.290
Uh. two shots of
tequila. bottom shelf.

banned the fights in Spain.

290

Vicente showed up at the bar.

291
00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:47.957
He keeps ordering and
Geoffrey keeps serving.

292
00:13:47.957 --> 00:13:51.221
Because what can you tell
a man who had it all...

293
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:54.877
You feel pity for me.
And you're nosy. huh?

294
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.142
You want to know
what Vicente Caudales

295
00:13:59.142 --> 00:14:00.491
is going to do now.

love. that you live for...

Poof!

To find something
new. or to die.

Do you know how the bull
dies. during the Estocada?

305
00:14:34.134 --> 00:14:38.399
I stab it between the
shoulders. through the heart!

Okay.

309
00:14:45.014 --> 00:14:46.755
Do you have the courage to
perform on me the Estocada?

00:14:48.713 --> 00:14:49.714
No.

[crickets cricking]

312
00:14:51.368 --> 00:14:54.894
I do not have the
courage to start anew.

313
00:14:56.852 --> 00:14:58.593
so I will kill myself.

314
00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:03.903
But tonight.

315
00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:08.559

How was your night?

00:15:30.668 --> 00:15:33.236
Pregame was the
best part. yours?

323
00:15:33.236 --> 00:15:34.411
Epic.

324
00:15:34.411 --> 00:15:36.805
Hey. um. I was wondering.

325
00:15:36.805 --> 00:15:39.286
do you wanna go on a
Vespa ride with me?

326
00:15:39.286 --> 00:15:41.375
I'm borrowing that
guy's Vespa today.

327

Leonardo's?

328
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.681
I don't know. could be fun.

329
00:15:45.161 --> 00:15:47.947
Yeah. yeah. definitely.

330
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.557
Do you know how to drive it?

[speaking Spanish]

336
00:15:57.565 --> 00:15:59.393
What the fuck Leo. come on.

337
00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:01.177
Finals start in 10
minutes all right.

338
00:16:01.177 --> 00:16:03.397
and we're in way
deeper shit than that.

339
00:16:03.397 --> 00:16:05.399
Okay. the names on the beds.

340
00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:07.923
I was just trying
to entertain myself.

341
00:16:07.923 --> 00:16:09.142
I can redraft the apartment

342
00:16:09.142 --> 00:16:10.970
but please don't
report me for...

343
00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:14.103
sexual harassment.

344
00:16:14.103 --> 00:16:16.888
So you assigned
two people per bed.

345
00:16:16.888 --> 00:16:18.020
who gives a fuck?

346
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.587
Everyone knows you're a perv.

347
00:16:19.587 --> 00:16:21.981
I mean. you were voted
most likely to perv.

348
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.548
Come to think of it. this
is probably your best shot

349
00:16:24.548 --> 00:16:26.376
to get with Claire.

350
00:16:26.376 --> 00:16:29.249
I've seen the way you look
at her. It's so creepy

351
00:16:29.249 --> 00:16:32.469
and quit walking so
close. she knows.

352
00:16:32.469 --> 00:16:35.995
Let's get serious. Leo.
your projects this semester

353
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:39.259
have been well. superb.

354
00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:41.609
Maybe I didn't
challenge you enough.

00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:55.420
So. what are we doing today?

717
00:38:58.379 --> 00:39:01.208
Okay. don't answer me. I'll
just go hang out with Dan.

718
00:39:01.208 --> 00:39:03.079
- He went nuts last night.
- Really?

719
00:39:03.079 --> 00:39:04.254
- No.
- Oh.

720
00:39:04.254 --> 00:39:06.779
Dan doesn't know how to live.

721
00:39:06.779 --> 00:39:08.998
He's wasting his life
in front of a computer.

722
00:39:08.998 --> 00:39:11.392
I don't know. maybe
that's just his M.O.

723
00:39:11.392 --> 00:39:12.567
he seems pretty happy.

724
00:39:12.567 --> 00:39:15.614
You should go and see Giorgia.

725
00:39:15.614 --> 00:39:16.658
Giorgia.

726
00:39:18.573 --> 00:39:20.053
I could go bug her at work.

727
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.577
[footsteps fading]

728
00:39:22.577 --> 00:39:23.404
[birds chirping]

729
00:39:25.711 --> 00:39:26.799
[leaves rustling]

730
00:39:29.149 --> 00:39:30.368
Can I talk to you?

731
00:39:33.414 --> 00:39:36.504
[introspective music]

732
00:39:36.504 --> 00:39:37.723
[birds chirping]

733
00:39:38.941 --> 00:39:42.597
[introspective music]

734
00:39:52.912 --> 00:39:54.914
[Amber Jane] Chapel tower.

735
00:39:54.914 --> 00:39:56.263
[Rome] Twice.

736
00:39:56.263 --> 00:39:57.612
Music rooms.

737
00:39:57.612 --> 00:39:59.875
[Amber Jane] Many times.
[both chuckle]

738
00:40:01.355 --> 00:40:02.878
Do you remember the very
first time we kissed?

739
00:40:02.878 --> 00:40:06.882
Of course. it was
freshman year. snowing.

740
00:40:08.362 --> 00:40:09.885
You know I made it
to check-in on time?

741
00:40:10.886 --> 00:40:12.845
From Willard Hall.

742
00:40:12.845 --> 00:40:14.760
in one minute.

743
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.761
I don't think I'll run half
as fast the rest of my life.

744
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:16.892
Rome. I miss you.

745
00:40:21.593 --> 00:40:23.203
This whole semester has been--

746
00:40:25.597 --> 00:40:27.729
How can you say
something like that?

747
00:40:27.729 --> 00:40:30.471
And then at times be so
scathing. denigrating.

748
00:40:30.471 --> 00:40:32.908
Stop using SAT words.

749
00:40:32.908 --> 00:40:36.434
They're not SAT words.
they're just. words.

750
00:40:37.913 --> 00:40:39.698
You say don't love me
anymore. Amber Jane.

751
00:40:41.003 --> 00:40:42.352
And now you say you miss me.

752
00:40:43.658 --> 00:40:46.356
It's. it's a little crazy.

753
00:40:46.356 --> 00:40:47.183
It is.

754
00:40:48.228 --> 00:40:49.055
It is.

755
00:40:52.058 --> 00:40:53.973
I'm sorry. Rome.

756
00:40:55.409 --> 00:40:57.237
[introspective music]

757
00:41:12.905 --> 00:41:13.906
I need to know.

758
00:41:15.342 --> 00:41:17.126
What's the real
story with Leonardo?

759
00:41:18.388 --> 00:41:19.694
You're always so jealous.

760
00:41:22.697 --> 00:41:24.046
Listen. it's fine.

761
00:41:26.396 --> 00:41:30.052
I forgive your jealousy. it
just means you care about me.

762
00:41:33.316 --> 00:41:34.840
Let's go back to the villa.

763
00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:38.844
I want you to ravish me.

764
00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.064
[whispers] It's an
eighth of a villa.

765
00:41:42.064 --> 00:41:44.023
Shh.

766
00:41:44.023 --> 00:41:47.113
[whimsical music]

767
00:41:47.113 --> 00:41:49.724
[footsteps approaching]

768
00:41:49.724 --> 00:41:51.552
[birds chirping]

769
00:41:53.902 --> 00:41:55.382
[bell ringing]

770
00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.300
[Leo moaning]

771
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.215
[Leo] Am I doing this right?

772
00:42:02.215 --> 00:42:03.042
Perfect.

773
00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.959
Maybe a little faster?

774
00:42:08.047 --> 00:42:09.222
Okay.

775
00:42:09.222 --> 00:42:10.528
[moaning]
[bed creaking]

776
00:42:11.485 --> 00:42:12.878
[both moaning]

777
00:42:12.878 --> 00:42:14.836
- Perfect
- I need to slow down.

778
00:42:16.882 --> 00:42:18.623
[frame creaking]

779
00:42:20.363 --> 00:42:22.365
[bed clattering]
[both panting]

780
00:42:22.365 --> 00:42:24.150
[foot thud]

781
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:25.934
[Leo] They banned this in Spain.
They banned this in Spain.

782
00:42:25.934 --> 00:42:28.415
Charles Dickens.
Charles Dickens.

783
00:42:28.415 --> 00:42:30.373
Charles Dickens!

784
00:42:30.373 --> 00:42:31.200
Shit.

785
00:42:34.639 --> 00:42:36.902
[whimsical music]

786
00:42:46.868 --> 00:42:47.869
[door shuts]

787
00:43:01.361 --> 00:43:02.188
[wood creaks]

788
00:43:12.328 --> 00:43:13.503
[deep sighing]

789
00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:20.293
[grunts. taps]

790
00:43:26.038 --> 00:43:28.693
[frenzied footsteps]

791
00:43:34.046 --> 00:43:34.960
[door slams]

792
00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:39.312
[Claire laughing]

793
00:43:39.312 --> 00:43:40.618
She's seriously gotten
dumber since she started

794
00:43:40.618 --> 00:43:42.097
hooking up with Leo.

795
00:43:42.097 --> 00:43:43.272
[Claire laughing]

796
00:43:43.272 --> 00:43:45.013
It's like the head of a beluga.

797
00:43:45.013 --> 00:43:46.536
[Claire laughing]

798
00:43:46.536 --> 00:43:49.061
I bet he'll die during
his gap year. O.D.

799
00:43:50.149 --> 00:43:51.324
He's my best friend.

800
00:43:51.324 --> 00:43:52.847
I know but. you'll see.

801
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.633
Fine for high school
but. you know.

802
00:43:57.286 --> 00:43:58.244
I don't actually.

803
00:43:59.985 --> 00:44:03.249
I don't think he's bright
enough for you. okay?

804
00:44:03.249 --> 00:44:05.164
It's a compliment.

805
00:44:05.164 --> 00:44:08.341
You should be friends with
people of a certain level.

806
00:44:08.341 --> 00:44:09.168
You like it?

807
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.606
I got it at your
little friend's store.

808
00:44:12.606 --> 00:44:14.826
Cheap stuff but
what can you expect?

809
00:44:14.826 --> 00:44:17.176
It's Santa Lorena. not Milan.

810
00:44:19.744 --> 00:44:23.008
Come here. I want
you to rip it off me.

811
00:44:26.533 --> 00:44:30.145
No. no.

812
00:44:35.629 --> 00:44:37.718
Look we broke up.
Amber Jane. okay?

813
00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:39.633
You broke up with me.

814
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.810
I think we should
stay broken up.

815
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:46.596
[sighing]

816
00:44:46.596 --> 00:44:50.035
I mean. how can you be so
disparaging of your friend

817
00:44:50.035 --> 00:44:51.210
and my best friend?

818
00:44:53.429 --> 00:44:56.606
No. I don't want to rip
off Giorgia's swimsuit.

819
00:45:00.219 --> 00:45:01.176
This was a mistake.

820
00:45:04.484 --> 00:45:06.791
[gasping]

821
00:45:06.791 --> 00:45:08.357
[door slams]

822
00:45:08.357 --> 00:45:11.143
[indignant panting]

823
00:45:11.143 --> 00:45:14.973
You're oblivious. stupid.

824
00:45:14.973 --> 00:45:16.626
[headrest bangs]

825
00:45:16.626 --> 00:45:18.628
[pillow thud]
[indistinct grievance]

826
00:45:19.673 --> 00:45:20.500
[Amber Jane] Rome?

827
00:45:22.632 --> 00:45:25.026
Pssst. what's going on?

828
00:45:27.333 --> 00:45:28.160
Nothing.

829
00:45:29.814 --> 00:45:31.729
I think I'm finally
over Amber Jane.

830
00:45:33.774 --> 00:45:34.644
Come in.

831
00:45:36.255 --> 00:45:37.299
Centipede style?

832
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:41.260
[upbeat music]

833
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.748
It's dick time.

834
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:52.662
[singing in Italian]

835
00:45:56.666 --> 00:45:58.190
[Unremarkable Dan] Get
the fuck off of me!

836
00:45:59.931 --> 00:46:01.889
[footsteps pattering]
[both struggling]

837
00:46:01.889 --> 00:46:03.151
[grunting]

838
00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:04.239
[Schmae] Fucking bitch.

839
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:06.894
Fucking bitch!

840
00:46:08.591 --> 00:46:11.159
[upbeat music]
[singing in Italian]

841
00:46:19.428 --> 00:46:21.953
I know. I'm more
off-putting during the day.

842
00:46:24.042 --> 00:46:25.434
I have something for you.

843
00:46:30.918 --> 00:46:32.485
I love it.

844
00:46:32.485 --> 00:46:34.139
[bells ringing]

845
00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:36.358
[Rome] I need to confess
something that happened.

846
00:46:36.358 --> 00:46:41.363
This morning. Amber Jane. my
ex. she wanted to talk. so.

847
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.586
We talked about stuff.
the past. et cetera.

848
00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:52.810
And then she kissed me.
And I resisted. at first.

849
00:46:54.289 --> 00:46:57.205
but then I kissed her
back for a little while.

850
00:46:59.599 --> 00:47:01.340
But then I realized. you
know. it was a big mistake

851
00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.168
and we're not right
for each other.

852
00:47:03.168 --> 00:47:04.909
Look. I know you probably
don't care about this.

853
00:47:04.909 --> 00:47:06.475
'cause you're super
liberal about these things.

854
00:47:06.475 --> 00:47:09.478
but I just wanted
to tell you. since.

855
00:47:09.478 --> 00:47:11.611
You know. we've been hanging
out these last two days

856
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:12.786
which has been great.

857
00:47:14.135 --> 00:47:15.571
I'm not with her anymore.

858
00:47:17.922 --> 00:47:19.445
I'm sorry.

859
00:47:19.445 --> 00:47:21.142
We're not boyfriend
and girlfriend.

860
00:47:21.142 --> 00:47:25.103
I mean. you don't. you
don't have to apologize.

861
00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:28.671
Okay.

862
00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:33.807
Can I still see you
today or maybe tonight?

863
00:47:33.807 --> 00:47:34.634
Not today.

864
00:47:35.765 --> 00:47:37.158
[Giorgia] I'll see you around.

865
00:47:41.162 --> 00:47:43.338
Thank you for the drawing.

866
00:47:43.338 --> 00:47:45.906
[gentle music]

867
00:47:58.788 --> 00:47:59.789
[sighing]

868
00:47:59.789 --> 00:48:02.357
[gentle music]

869
00:48:11.497 --> 00:48:13.847
[sea lapping]

870
00:48:59.066 --> 00:49:00.024
You keep a diary?

871
00:49:00.981 --> 00:49:02.461
Kind of.

872
00:49:02.461 --> 00:49:04.942
With like. your feelings?

873
00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:06.552
[Claire chuckling]

874
00:49:06.552 --> 00:49:08.423
Sometimes.

875
00:49:08.423 --> 00:49:12.210
Usually events. special
times I want to remember.

876
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:13.211
Can I read it?

877
00:49:14.429 --> 00:49:15.953
You can read this page.

878
00:49:17.302 --> 00:49:18.781
You're in it.

879
00:49:18.781 --> 00:49:20.435
[Claire chuckling]

880
00:49:20.435 --> 00:49:21.959
You see. in 10 years.

881
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:24.526
I would have forgotten
all about this trip.

882
00:49:24.526 --> 00:49:28.530
Or maybe have some vague
memory of it. you know.

883
00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:30.010
the vacation with the Vespa.

884
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:31.838
[Claire chuckling]

885
00:49:31.838 --> 00:49:35.885
So this diary is a sort
of door to the past.

886
00:49:36.886 --> 00:49:38.062
A way to access it.

887
00:49:39.846 --> 00:49:42.631
And when I open to this page.

888
00:49:42.631 --> 00:49:43.458
I'll remember.

889
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.072
the Vespa and the spritz.

890
00:49:48.072 --> 00:49:50.248
sunbathing with Amber Jane.

891
00:49:51.858 --> 00:49:52.859
Leo.

892
00:49:55.949 --> 00:49:58.734
You should try keeping a
diary during your gap year.

893
00:49:58.734 --> 00:49:59.953
Yeah. maybe.

894
00:50:02.956 --> 00:50:04.305
Can I read the whole thing?

895
00:50:04.305 --> 00:50:06.046
No.

896
00:50:06.046 --> 00:50:08.396
There are definitely
embarrassing things in here.

897
00:50:08.396 --> 00:50:09.963
Boys from the past.

898
00:50:09.963 --> 00:50:10.964
[both laughing]

899
00:50:10.964 --> 00:50:12.226
Now I have to read it.

900
00:50:12.226 --> 00:50:14.011
No.
[Claire laughing]

901
00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:15.316
I have a proposition.

902
00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:20.191
I'll open the diary and whatever
I land on. I can read it.

903
00:50:22.889 --> 00:50:23.803
Fine.

904
00:50:25.239 --> 00:50:26.197
[Claire titters]

905
00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:32.551
- Oh no no no that's too
embarrassing. - Wait wait wait.

906
00:50:35.858 --> 00:50:38.252
[wistful music]

907
00:50:38.252 --> 00:50:40.863
A library. with walnut floors.

908
00:50:40.863 --> 00:50:42.082
[water splashing]

909
00:50:42.082 --> 00:50:43.736
All I wanted was
to get with her.

910
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:48.349
Now that I did. I
realize I don't have her.

911
00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:53.137
Soon. I'll just be
another guy from the past.

912
00:50:55.008 --> 00:50:56.314
A page in her diary.

913
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:00.057
I think you should appreciate

914
00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:01.710
that she even lets
you talk to her.

915
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:04.365
The fact you've
been inside her...

916
00:51:05.671 --> 00:51:07.760
blows my fucking mind.

917
00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:11.068
You want too much.

918
00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:13.592
But hey. if you really want it.

919
00:51:13.592 --> 00:51:15.594
you're gonna have
to work for it.

920
00:51:15.594 --> 00:51:16.682
[tapping]

921
00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:19.815
You're wise.

922
00:51:19.815 --> 00:51:23.732
If I were really wise.
I'd be fucking rich.

923
00:51:23.732 --> 00:51:25.647
[film camera rolling]

924
00:51:32.785 --> 00:51:34.526
[memory chimes]

925
00:51:37.181 --> 00:51:40.053

[tense suspenseful music]

927

[pebbles moving]

928
00:52:08.821 --> 00:52:10.127
Vicente! Vicente!

929
00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:11.824
Don't do it!

930
00:52:11.824 --> 00:52:13.695
I have nothing to live for.

931
00:52:13.695 --> 00:52:14.914
Stop. stop okay?

932
00:52:14.914 --> 00:52:16.263
[Rome panting]

933
00:52:17.438 --> 00:52:18.439
[tense suspenseful music]

934
00:52:18.439 --> 00:52:21.138
Look. I'll do it. okay?

935
00:52:22.574 --> 00:52:27.100
I'll perform the.
Estocada on you. okay?

936
00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.406
So you can die with honor.

937
00:52:30.451 --> 00:52:31.365
Like the bulls?

938
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.238
Yeah. yeah like the bulls.

939
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:38.503
I am listening.

940
00:52:40.244 --> 00:52:43.421
I can stab you through
the nape. into your heart.

941
00:52:43.421 --> 00:52:44.726
That's not a problem.

942
00:52:46.511 --> 00:52:50.297
But. first I've gotta go
back and change. you know?

943
00:52:50.297 --> 00:52:53.170
Ah. I have to be wearing my
finest attire. to honor you.

944
00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:55.041
You know. Like you
honor the bulls.

945
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:56.825
Of course. of course.

946
00:52:56.825 --> 00:52:59.654
And plus. I mean. it's
flood tide right now. right?

947
00:52:59.654 --> 00:53:01.482
So you're body's just
gonna end up on the rocks.

948
00:53:01.482 --> 00:53:03.397
Wait for the tide
to be going out

949
00:53:03.397 --> 00:53:05.921
so you'll be carried into the
Mediterranean Sea. with honor.

950
00:53:05.921 --> 00:53:06.879
Like the beluga?

951
00:53:08.576 --> 00:53:11.231
Yeah. yeah like the beluga.

952
00:53:11.231 --> 00:53:13.015
You know. and there's
also less chance

953
00:53:13.015 --> 00:53:14.669
of me being arrested for
homicide which is always a plus.

954
00:53:17.324 --> 00:53:18.282
[inhales deeply]
Okay.

955
00:53:19.761 --> 00:53:22.677
Estocada. when the
lower arc of the sun

956
00:53:22.677 --> 00:53:24.679
is 15 degrees from horizon.

957
00:53:25.767 --> 00:53:26.594
Okay.

958
00:53:28.117 --> 00:53:31.425
And hey. if you don't
kill me. I am jumping.

959
00:53:33.819 --> 00:53:35.864
Fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck.

960
00:53:37.257 --> 00:53:38.737
[tense dramatic music]

961
00:53:38.737 --> 00:53:39.868
[footsteps approaching]

962
00:53:39.868 --> 00:53:42.131
What the fuck.

963
00:53:42.131 --> 00:53:44.221
[tense dramatic music]

964
00:53:47.876 --> 00:53:51.837
[fast running patter]

965
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:54.318
[raps on glass]

966
00:53:56.624 --> 00:53:58.322
Rome please. not today.

967
00:53:59.758 --> 00:54:00.933
[Rome heaving]

968
00:54:00.933 --> 00:54:03.283
This has nothing to do with us.

969
00:54:03.283 --> 00:54:06.895
Vicente Caudales. is
going to kill himself.

970
00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:09.115
[footsteps approaching]

971
00:54:09.115 --> 00:54:10.943
[tense dramatic music]

972
00:54:44.629 --> 00:54:45.804
[door booming]

973
00:54:45.804 --> 00:54:47.109
I came super super quick.

974
00:54:53.855 --> 00:54:55.030
Where's Amber Jane?

975
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:56.684
[spiritual music]

976
00:55:08.914 --> 00:55:10.089
Whatever.

977
00:55:10.089 --> 00:55:12.004
Alright. here's the deal.

978
00:55:12.004 --> 00:55:15.573
Vicente Caudales is
planning to kill himself.

979
00:55:15.573 --> 00:55:17.618
Now. I bought us some more time.

980
00:55:17.618 --> 00:55:19.968
because I promised I'm
gonna murder him myself.

981
00:55:19.968 --> 00:55:22.057
I do not intend to go
forward with that promise.

982
00:55:22.057 --> 00:55:24.103
By which point. he's gonna
proceed with his plan.

983
00:55:24.103 --> 00:55:25.452
Now what we need to do.

984
00:55:25.452 --> 00:55:27.324
is help Vicente change his mind.

985
00:55:28.368 --> 00:55:30.327
Find meaning in his life.

986
00:55:30.327 --> 00:55:32.720
Otherwise. even if
we save him today.

987
00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.896
he's just gonna kill
himself any other day.

988
00:55:34.896 --> 00:55:38.639
Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday.

989
00:55:38.639 --> 00:55:40.467
Thursday.

990
00:55:40.467 --> 00:55:42.251
Hey. it's great that you guys
know the days of the week.

991
00:55:42.251 --> 00:55:43.644
but listen. you're
getting way too ambitious

992
00:55:43.644 --> 00:55:45.516
with the whole
meaning of life thing.

993
00:55:45.516 --> 00:55:47.256
We just need to make
sure this guy doesn't die

994
00:55:47.256 --> 00:55:49.346
before the sun dips
below the horizon line.

995
00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:52.697
[keyboard clicking]

996
00:55:52.697 --> 00:55:54.394
Dan. are you with us?

997
00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.225
The fuck!

998
00:55:59.225 --> 00:56:01.270
Someone's life is on the line.
and you're fucking around.

999
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:04.317
[electronic music playing
from Dan's computer]

1000
00:56:04.317 --> 00:56:05.318
What is this?

1001
00:56:05.318 --> 00:56:08.147
[electronic music]

1002
00:56:08.147 --> 00:56:09.583
This is phenomenal.

1003
00:56:09.583 --> 00:56:10.889
Who is this?

1004
00:56:10.889 --> 00:56:12.804
Well it's my song.

1005
00:56:12.804 --> 00:56:14.719
I've been making it over the
past few days. it's almost--

1006
00:56:14.719 --> 00:56:16.808
Bullshit. this isn't your song.

1007
00:56:16.808 --> 00:56:19.550
[scoffs] Yeah it is.
It's Pro Tools. bitch.

1008
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:23.075
[electronic music]

1009
00:56:46.577 --> 00:56:47.404
That's it.

1010
00:56:48.535 --> 00:56:49.754
This is it.

1011
00:56:49.754 --> 00:56:51.625
Vicente enjoys electronic music.

1012
00:56:51.625 --> 00:56:53.671
Everyone enjoys
electronic music.

1013
00:56:53.671 --> 00:56:54.498
Think about it...

1014
00:56:55.977 --> 00:56:57.457
Even if there's one
reason. however small.

1015
00:56:57.457 --> 00:56:59.067
why existing is better
than not existing.

1016
00:56:59.067 --> 00:57:00.808
Why it's better to
be than not to be.

1017
00:57:02.027 --> 00:57:03.811
One thing that makes him smile.

1018
00:57:03.811 --> 00:57:06.074
Whoa. whoa. whoa. you're
getting way too philosophical.

1019
00:57:06.074 --> 00:57:07.902
No. no. he's right.

1020
00:57:07.902 --> 00:57:10.165
Given the choice between
listening to this sick song

1021
00:57:10.165 --> 00:57:13.430
and dying. it's better to listen
to this song. much better.

1022
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:15.214
I'd stay alive for this.

1023
00:57:15.214 --> 00:57:17.434
Is not finished. I still
haven't added the djembe track.

1024
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:19.566
Could give it that
Spanish flair.

1025
00:57:19.566 --> 00:57:22.656
[Spanish Flamenco music]

1026
00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:29.968
That would be absurd.

1027
00:57:31.448 --> 00:57:33.319
[suspenseful music]

1028
00:57:36.627 --> 00:57:39.020
All right for when that doesn't
work. I have a real plan.

1029
00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.326
We need all hands on deck.

1030
00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:43.547
Amber Jane.

1031
00:57:44.504 --> 00:57:45.374
Amber?

1032
00:57:48.769 --> 00:57:50.031
[temporal whir]
[clock ticking]

1033
00:57:54.732 --> 00:57:55.994
[door opening]

1034
00:57:55.994 --> 00:57:57.778
[loud sigh]

1035
00:57:57.778 --> 00:58:00.128
Goddammit. Amber
Jane. hogging Claire.

1036
00:58:01.216 --> 00:58:02.609
What a bitch of a situation.

1037
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:06.004
Whatever.

1038
00:58:06.004 --> 00:58:09.181
[footsteps pattering]

1039
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:12.097
[paper rustling]

1040
00:58:12.097 --> 00:58:14.186
On the pier. we're gonna
need a few key players.

1041
00:58:15.448 --> 00:58:17.363
[suspenseful music]

1042
00:58:18.538 --> 00:58:19.974
Vicente Caudales.

1043
00:58:22.542 --> 00:58:24.109
Rome. for the kill.

1044
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:31.638
Geoffrey. serving shots
to loosen everyone up

1045
00:58:31.638 --> 00:58:34.467
'cause let's be honest.
this is some intense shit.

1046
00:58:34.467 --> 00:58:37.209
[suspenseful music]

1047
00:58:41.561 --> 00:58:43.258
Dan. with the music cued.

1048
00:58:46.784 --> 00:58:49.526
And Giorgia. 'cause
you're super hot.

1049
00:58:49.526 --> 00:58:51.789
and hot girls give
guys a reason to live.

1050
00:58:51.789 --> 00:58:54.269
I'm not being misogynistic.
I'm just being honest.

1051
00:58:54.269 --> 00:58:57.011
[suspenseful music]

1052
00:59:01.146 --> 00:59:03.322
Once he realizes you're
not really gonna kill him.

1053
00:59:03.322 --> 00:59:04.497
he's gonna jump in the water

1054
00:59:04.497 --> 00:59:05.846
with the rocks tied to his feet.

1055
00:59:05.846 --> 00:59:07.500
So we need to do two things.

1056
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.067
One. remove rocks.

1057
00:59:09.067 --> 00:59:10.895
Two. get this guy
out of the water.

1058
00:59:10.895 --> 00:59:12.331
I have a dinghy.

1059
00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:14.812
I fucking love this guy.

1060
00:59:14.812 --> 00:59:15.813

[engine roaring]

1067
00:59:42.796 --> 00:59:46.017
Schmae. you're sneaky as
shit. can cling to the pier?

1068
00:59:46.017 --> 00:59:47.714
Like a barnacle.

1069
00:59:47.714 --> 00:59:50.151
Exactly. like a
motherfucking barnacle.

1070
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:51.500
You'll patiently wait.

1071
00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.980
And right before he jumps in.

1072
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:54.591
you untie the rocks
from his ankles.

1073
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:55.592
Done.

1074
00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:57.376

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.851
So. what's next for you?

1254
01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:34.290
You're still nosy. huh?

1255
01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:37.510
You want to know what Vicente
Caudales is going to do. huh?

1256
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:38.990
[sighs]

1257
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:41.079
I will tour all
Mediterranean Islands.

1258
01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:46.040
Festivals. parties.
and discover new music.

1259
01:11:47.738 --> 01:11:49.043
Sounds like a good plan.

1260
01:11:49.043 --> 01:11:51.611
[emotional music]

1261
01:12:18.072 --> 01:12:19.335
[car door creaking]

1262
01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:22.163
You guys weren't so terrible.

1263
01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:24.601
That means a lot. buddy.

1264
01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:27.038
It's been a great mini vacation.

1265
01:12:27.038 --> 01:12:29.127
Now get to work. asshole.

1266
01:12:38.092 --> 01:12:39.485
[emotional music]

1267
01:12:45.186 --> 01:12:47.624
Can you really come
back this summer?

1268
01:12:47.624 --> 01:12:48.755
And then what?

1269
01:12:52.106 --> 01:12:53.978
[kissing]

1270
01:13:36.237 --> 01:13:38.414
Are we coming back
to Santa Lorena?

1271
01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:39.458
[phone dings]

1272
01:13:43.941 --> 01:13:44.942
Let's go graduate.

1273
01:13:46.378 --> 01:13:47.510
and come straight
back to Santa Lorena.

1274
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:48.380
Yes!

1275
01:13:49.816 --> 01:13:51.557
[car engine roaring]
[uplifting music]

1276
01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:53.080
So this was only the
pregame. Who's coming back?

1277
01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:55.431
Dan. tell me you're coming back.

1278
01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.084
You can DJ. I'll event plan.

1279
01:13:57.084 --> 01:13:58.738
We can make millions.

1280
01:13:58.738 --> 01:14:00.958
DJ name? Unremarkable Dan.

1281
01:14:00.958 --> 01:14:02.438
Remarkable Dan.

1282
01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:03.830
DJ Dan.

1283
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:05.615
[Claire laughing]

1284
01:14:05.615 --> 01:14:08.095
That's pretty unremarkable
but kind of awesome.

1285
01:14:09.923 --> 01:14:11.708
[engine roaring]

1286
01:14:11.708 --> 01:14:14.885
[Narrator] While memory
is a comforting access

1287
01:14:14.885 --> 01:14:15.886
to the past.

1288
01:14:17.627 --> 01:14:20.412
it is also a cruel reminder
of its inaccessibility.

1289
01:14:21.848 --> 01:14:25.896
Everything ends.
The tide recedes.

1290
01:14:25.896 --> 01:14:29.465
But we are made of those
impressions. like barnacles.

1291
01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:31.684
brushed by the ancient sea.

1292
01:14:31.684 --> 01:14:35.688
Holding on between the
past and the future.

1293
01:14:37.168 --> 01:14:39.039
[Leo] So Ms. Polotzi.

1294
01:14:39.039 --> 01:14:41.781
I think I will need that
recommendation after all.

1295
01:14:41.781 --> 01:14:44.218
I'm applying to
architecture school.

1296
01:14:44.218 --> 01:14:47.700
I sent you a copy of my designs
for Claire's dream house.

1297
01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.746
no need to inform
the authorities.

1298
01:14:49.746 --> 01:14:51.487
Claire knows all about it.

1299
01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.489
In fact. she's
with me right now.

1300
01:14:54.968 --> 01:14:56.143
We're spending a
few days together

1301
01:14:56.143 --> 01:14:57.710
before I get back on the road.

1302
01:14:57.710 --> 01:15:00.496
So far. I haven't
screwed things up.

1303
01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.454
But I'll keep you posted.

1304
01:15:02.454 --> 01:15:04.369
Love. Leo.

1305
01:15:04.369 --> 01:15:06.937
[uplifting music]

1306
01:15:08.329 --> 01:15:09.766
I told you she wanted my dick.

1307
01:15:09.766 --> 01:15:13.291
[upbeat music]
[singing in Italian]

1308
01:16:42.554 --> 01:16:43.642
[plastic bag rustling]

1309
01:16:43.642 --> 01:16:44.948
[speaking Spanish]
