3
00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:37.708
Don't be scared.

4
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.333
Hey?

5
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.667
Tucker?

6
00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:07.542
Tucker?

7
00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.167
Tucker?

8
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.125
Breathe. Just breathe.

9
00:05:21.708 --> 00:05:23.000
It's clean.

10
00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:31.792
Radiation?

11
00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:35.458
No. no radiation.

12
00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:43.000
No neurological damage.

13
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.708
Where's Holden?

14
00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.125
She crossed over.

15
00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:53.333
That puts you in command.

16
00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.167
- We need to report.
- Yes.

17
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.667
How long until
the tide comes back in?

18
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.250
Six hours and 45 minutes.

19
00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.042
OK. We'll use that time
to gather data.

20
00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:10.750
I want to report results
by then.

21
00:06:11.208 --> 00:06:12.375
Let's gear up.

22
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.500
I'm gonna do
the first recon on my own.

23
00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:12.667
<i>Blake. Can you hear me?</i>

24
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.917
- First recon underway at 8:17.
<i>- Copy.</i>

25
00:07:16.542 --> 00:07:17.792
Argh...

26
00:07:42.708 --> 00:07:44.292
<i>What's it like out there?</i>

27
00:07:45.292 --> 00:07:46.458
Still flat.

28
00:07:47.542 --> 00:07:49.042
We should go into detail.

29
00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:51.750
<i>What ya got?</i>

30
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.417
<i>Are you seeing this?</i>

31
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.625
<i>Confirming
biogeochemical recycling.</i>

32
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.500
This exceeds
the model's predictions.

33
00:08:23.292 --> 00:08:24.583
Can you classify?

34
00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:26.500
<i>Chelicerata.</i>

35
00:08:26.917 --> 00:08:28.250
Clearly a reproductive.

36
00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:33.207
I'm guessing
internal fertilisation.

37
00:08:38.042 --> 00:08:39.000
We should test.

38
00:08:40.417 --> 00:08:41.500
It's too soon.

39
00:08:41.582 --> 00:08:44.167
We've been away from Kepler's
radiation for 563 days.

40
00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:45.792
<i>It's worth a shot.</i>

41
00:08:49.208 --> 00:08:51.667
<i>Run the biometer.
That's an order.</i>

42
00:09:11.042 --> 00:09:12.958
Erythrocyte count
is normal range.

43
00:09:13.042 --> 00:09:16.125
- Yeah. haemoglobin's the same.
- Minor reduction in leukocytes.

44
00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:17.625
Well. that's a good sign.
right?

45
00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:20.833
Negative.

46
00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:30.042
Hey. Blake.

47
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.542
<i>At least it's a prospect.</i>

48
00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:40.083
Moving on.

49
00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:51.458
Blake?
I'm tracking some weather.

50
00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:53.167
I'm getting a high
humidity reading.

51
00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:56.083
<i>The patterns
are changing real fast.</i>

52
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.917
Copy. What are they?

53
00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:01.792
<i>Ah... Aurelia aurita.</i>

54
00:10:01.875 --> 00:10:04.750
They reproduce
both sexually and asexually.

55
00:10:19.292 --> 00:10:20.750
- What happened?
- It stung me.

56
00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:22.458
<i>Your vitals are fine.</i>

57
00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:24.292
<i>They have these barbs
on their tentacles.</i>

58
00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:25.875
Maybe I should've
warned you about that.

59
00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.333
Thank you.

60
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.750
<i>Blake. the weather's
getting worse.</i>

61
00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:32.750
<i>It's probably
a storm coming in.</i>

62
00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:36.083
<i>Let's send
what we've got so far.</i>

63
00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:47.000
<i>Our next communication window</i>

64
00:10:47.083 --> 00:10:48.958
<i>is in four hours
and five minutes.</i>

65
00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:50.250
Copy.

66
00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:07.833
I lost visibility.

67
00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:11.250
You better come back to base.
I'll shoot you a flare.

68
00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:29.417
Got it. Coming in.

69
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.958
- That was quick.
<i>- What was?</i>

70
00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:13.458
- You.
- But I'm still two clicks away.

71
00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:20.958
<i>Tucker?</i>

72
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.208
<i>Tucker. do you copy?</i>

73
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.958
Blake. go again.

74
00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:31.083
- What's going on?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

75
00:12:32.292 --> 00:12:34.042
–

76
00:12:45.333 --> 00:12:47.000
- Tucker!
- –

77
00:13:21.542 --> 00:13:23.875
Help! Blake!

78
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.458
Help!

79
00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.500
- What happened?
- They came out of nowhere.

80
00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:46.250
Survivors?

81
00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:47.833
Mmm.

82
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.458
I'm going to get you the meds.

83
00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:18.875
- Hey!
<i>- Agi!</i>

84
00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.875
My colleague
needs medical help!

85
00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.417
I saw a child. Tucker.

86
00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:35.750
A child.

87
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.625
Keep pressure on it.

88
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.125
<i>Enugoro! Ordu!</i>

89
00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:31.042
<i>Kumit. Kick na ooke.</i>

90
00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:32.625
<i>Hilfen.</i>

91
00:16:36.583 --> 00:16:37.583
<i>Hilfen.</i>

92
00:16:38.667 --> 00:16:39.917
<i>Hilfoken.</i>

93
00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:48.167
I need my medical equipment.

94
00:16:52.417 --> 00:16:54.750
- Do you understand me?
- <i>Mayi ye nel ye.</i>

95
00:16:54.833 --> 00:16:56.250
Narvik!

96
00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:58.083
Where is it?

97
00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.000
Where is it?

98
00:17:03.792 --> 00:17:04.833
In the pod.

99
00:17:28.166 --> 00:17:29.833
–

100
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.333
<i>Mish griev.</i>

101
00:17:50.208 --> 00:17:51.458
<i>Men ai nochte zere.</i>

102
00:17:54.042 --> 00:17:55.417
Then hold him still.

103
00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:02.750
I said keep him still!

104
00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:19.708
Tucker?

105
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.167
- Tucker.
- Blake...

106
00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:27.125
A whole community.
I saw babies.

107
00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.292
Babies. Tucker!

108
00:19:32.042 --> 00:19:34.083
- We have to let Kepler know.
- How?

109
00:19:35.833 --> 00:19:37.500
They destroyed the pod...

110
00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:39.542
the panel. everything...

111
00:19:41.125 --> 00:19:42.708
but I spotted the biometer.

112
00:19:43.042 --> 00:19:44.625
We'll just have to gain
their trust.

113
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.458
Maybe we can find
the Ulysses 1.

114
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.417
- I've lost too much blood.
- You don't have to do this.

115
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.875
I'll only slow you down.

116
00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:04.083
Base orders.

117
00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:07.167
If we pose a threat
to the mission. we have...

118
00:20:07.292 --> 00:20:10.083
No. you're my fertility match.
87%. remember?

119
00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:11.583
Without transmission...

120
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.167
none of this even matters.

121
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.875
Go.

122
00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:19.750
Get the biometer.

123
00:20:21.667 --> 00:20:23.333
Find the Ulysses 1.

124
00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:27.750
Maybe he's still alive.

125
00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.125
For the many.

126
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.167
I have something for you.

127
00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:00.917
I'm gonna give you one...

128
00:21:01.917 --> 00:21:03.542
and I'm gonna take
this one for me.

129
00:21:06.542 --> 00:21:09.000
My father got them
from his father.

130
00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:10.417
What is it?

131
00:21:19.708 --> 00:21:20.958
Don't be scared.

132
00:21:23.625 --> 00:21:26.000
Every time the second moon
passes Cygnus

133
00:21:26.458 --> 00:21:27.667
you light a match...

134
00:21:28.708 --> 00:21:30.000
and wherever I am...

135
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.958
in a ship or on a planet
far. far away...

136
00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:34.250
I'll do the same.

137
00:21:35.667 --> 00:21:37.333
And before
the last one's gone...

138
00:21:38.292 --> 00:21:39.667
we'll be together again.

139
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.667
I promise.

140
00:21:47.083 --> 00:21:48.667
Daddy. please don't leave me.

141
00:21:50.125 --> 00:21:51.792
What does Kepler teach us.
Louise?

142
00:21:52.625 --> 00:21:54.375
We will not think
about ourselves.

143
00:21:54.875 --> 00:21:56.500
We will not let
our emotions guide us.

144
00:21:56.625 --> 00:21:57.917
We do this for the many.

145
00:21:58.042 --> 00:21:58.917
Please.

146
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.125
- For the many. Louise.
- I don't want

147
00:22:00.208 --> 00:22:02.625
- to be here without you.
- Say it. For the many.

148
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.625
- For the many.
- Again. why do we do it?

149
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.792
- For the many.
- Yes. say it. for the many.

150
00:22:06.917 --> 00:22:08.417
That's why we do it.
for the many.

151
00:22:09.917 --> 00:22:11.000
Good.

152
00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:18.958
For the many.
For the many. For the many.

153
00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:21.625
For the many. For the many.

154
00:22:21.917 --> 00:22:25.875
For the many. For the many.
For the many.

155
00:23:07.875 --> 00:23:08.917
Oh!

156
00:23:14.958 --> 00:23:15.958
Hey!

157
00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:24.750
Help!

158
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.583
Help!

159
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.667
Help me!

160
00:26:02.583 --> 00:26:04.833
She was called Mother Earth.

161
00:26:06.833 --> 00:26:08.875
It's close enough to the sun
to have water

162
00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:11.000
air and fire.

163
00:26:11.375 --> 00:26:13.333
There used to be
tropical jungles

164
00:26:13.417 --> 00:26:16.417
and mighty forests
breathing oxygen for us.

165
00:26:18.667 --> 00:26:20.042
And we couldn't stay?

166
00:26:20.792 --> 00:26:22.708
No. we plundered
everything she offered.

167
00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:26.958
Now. you see.
we can take this...

168
00:26:32.917 --> 00:26:34.042
That's it.

169
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.250
This is the seedling
of a plant called "a tree".

170
00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:43.292
Will they ever grow?

171
00:26:43.667 --> 00:26:45.083
No. not here.

172
00:26:45.625 --> 00:26:47.708
Maybe I should take them
with me. what do you think?

173
00:26:49.792 --> 00:26:50.708
You had a signal?

174
00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.875
Yeah. I did.

175
00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:55.708
We left all these weather
stations around the globe.

176
00:26:57.125 --> 00:26:59.250
And to our surprise.
we got some data

177
00:26:59.333 --> 00:27:01.375
from one of the weather
stations right here.

178
00:27:01.958 --> 00:27:04.458
This one. It's called
the "Henderson Hub".

179
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.500
It seems like there's
a new area of regeneration.

180
00:27:07.917 --> 00:27:09.167
I mean. of course.
it's miles away

181
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.042
from any former
human civilisation

182
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.833
but that's a good thing.

183
00:27:13.625 --> 00:27:16.625
Because humans basically
spoiled the rest of the Earth.

184
00:27:20.625 --> 00:27:21.792
Listen. if...

185
00:27:22.417 --> 00:27:25.917
if what we find promises
to be true and it's safe...

186
00:27:27.583 --> 00:27:29.833
I'll send for you. alright?

187
00:27:30.625 --> 00:27:31.917
You promise?

188
00:27:32.083 --> 00:27:33.750
- I promise.
<i>- Five. four...</i>

For the many.
For the many. For the many.

00:28:06.333 --> 00:28:09.875
For the many. For the many.
For the many.

193
00:28:10.375 --> 00:28:12.708
For the many. For the many.

194
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.167
- For the many.
- For the many. For the many.

195
00:28:25.708 --> 00:28:27.000
<i>Back in grot.</i>

196
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.417
Hey! I'm thirsty!

197
00:28:32.167 --> 00:28:33.500
I need water!

198
00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:36.583
<i>Yas di iey iech?</i>

199
00:28:38.208 --> 00:28:39.250
Where did you get this?

200
00:28:44.625 --> 00:28:45.708
Hey.

201
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.042
Can you get that...
that red case?

202
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.625
The boy has it.
Can you get it from him?

203
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.583
No. the red case.

204
00:29:21.042 --> 00:29:22.625
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

205
00:29:25.792 --> 00:29:27.292
<i>Wien ar vu?</i>

206
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.458
<i>Wien... ar... vu?</i>

207
00:29:32.875 --> 00:29:35.708
- Oh. where am I from?
- <i>Frams eiland?</i>

208
00:29:42.792 --> 00:29:44.000
Earth.

209
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.250
<i>Aarda?</i>

210
00:29:45.833 --> 00:29:48.667
Yes.
And very far away from here

211
00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:51.583
there is another planet.
Kepler 209.

212
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:55.542
<i>Aarda? Wai kira?</i>

213
00:29:56.625 --> 00:29:58.042
Why we came to Earth?

214
00:30:00.542 --> 00:30:01.750
People...

215
00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:05.833
I mean. there are
no babies anymore.

216
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.333
<i>No kinders?</i>

217
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.375
Maila.

218
00:30:19.708 --> 00:30:20.917
I'm Blake.

219
00:30:24.708 --> 00:30:25.875
OK. Maila...

220
00:30:27.167 --> 00:30:29.083
if you could find
this thing for me.

221
00:30:31.583 --> 00:30:33.042
Can you bring it to me?

222
00:31:36.375 --> 00:31:37.542
Shh!

223
00:31:55.208 --> 00:31:58.125

224
00:32:14.833 --> 00:32:17.667

Mama?

235
00:35:01.208 --> 00:35:02.417

Who were those people?

240
00:36:22.542 --> 00:36:23.708
Who were they?

241
00:36:57.833 --> 00:36:58.792
Maila. she...

242
00:36:58.875 --> 00:36:59.875
She's your sister?

243
00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:02.542
Daughter.

244
00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:15.458
Where's her father?

245
00:37:17.583 --> 00:37:18.667
Flood took him.

246
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.125
Why are you following me?

247
00:37:43.417 --> 00:37:44.542
I wanna help you.

248
00:37:52.792 --> 00:37:54.208
You just want your stuff back!

249
00:37:56.708 --> 00:37:59.125

00:38:54.375 --> 00:38:56.125
- What are you doing?
- They're leaving.

254
00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:58.167
- That's just a flare gun.
- If they leave. she's gone!

255
00:39:00.833 --> 00:39:02.500
Listen to me! Shoot in the air.

256
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:04.958
- Shoot in the air.
- What?

257
00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:06.958
They'll be distracted.
while we free her.

258
00:39:11.167 --> 00:39:13.333
Trust me! Give it to me!

259
00:39:13.542 --> 00:39:14.750
- Narvik!
- Ah!

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.958

<i>Vjimay yiz deehea?</i>

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:32.625
Stop.

281
00:47:34.208 --> 00:47:35.625
Take off your cape.

282
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.167
Take it off.

283
00:47:52.542 --> 00:47:53.625
Hands up.

284
00:47:54.458 --> 00:47:55.542
Hands up!

285
00:48:12.542 --> 00:48:13.875
Mind your head.

286
00:48:26.667 --> 00:48:27.583
Wait here.

287
00:48:45.042 --> 00:48:46.458
You're not from here.

288
00:49:03.792 --> 00:49:05.583
Are you an astronaut?

289
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:12.667
She is.

290
00:49:17.542 --> 00:49:18.833
I can't believe it.

291
00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:22.917
Welcome!

292
00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:25.792
We've waited so long.

293
00:49:28.042 --> 00:49:29.208
I'm Gibson.

294
00:49:30.917 --> 00:49:32.125
Louise Blake. sir.

295
00:49:35.292 --> 00:49:36.458
Louise?

296
00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:40.833
Oh. God. I remember you.
You were...

297
00:49:41.458 --> 00:49:43.750
his size the last time
I saw you.

298
00:49:46.042 --> 00:49:49.042
Well. I'm sorry you didn't
receive a warmer welcome.

299
00:49:52.042 --> 00:49:53.250
What happened to your crew?

300
00:49:54.042 --> 00:49:55.167
They crossed.

301
00:49:56.958 --> 00:49:59.583
We had a malfunction
after entering the stratosphere.

302
00:50:01.375 --> 00:50:03.292
Have you communicated
with Kepler?

303
00:50:04.208 --> 00:50:07.042
No. the people we encountered
damaged the pod.

304
00:50:07.708 --> 00:50:09.667
Well. the people here.
they're...

305
00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:12.292
hot-headed.

306
00:50:13.583 --> 00:50:15.208
But we still have the biometer.

307
00:50:16.958 --> 00:50:19.875
We developed it on Kepler
to measure biochemical changes.

308
00:50:20.167 --> 00:50:21.875
It's specialised in fertility.

309
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.917
Your men took it.
It must be here somewhere.

310
00:50:25.417 --> 00:50:26.458
Can it transmit?

311
00:50:27.792 --> 00:50:28.958
Not by itself.

312
00:50:32.167 --> 00:50:35.167
I figured I could connect it
to the Ulysses 1's transmitters.

313
00:50:39.583 --> 00:50:42.417
I'm afraid the Ulysses 1
was completely destroyed.

314
00:50:47.625 --> 00:50:48.708
And my father?

315
00:51:05.375 --> 00:51:08.250
The people of Kepler
owe him a huge debt.

316
00:51:10.208 --> 00:51:11.292
What happened?

317
00:51:15.208 --> 00:51:18.292
Shortly after sending
our last status report

318
00:51:19.833 --> 00:51:21.500
we encountered the survivors.

319
00:51:22.333 --> 00:51:24.000
"Muds". we called them.

320
00:51:24.167 --> 00:51:26.167
We were stunned
these people had survived.

321
00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:29.375
Your father. in particular.
was very good with them.

322
00:51:30.583 --> 00:51:34.958
And then. we were waiting for
the next communication window

323
00:51:35.625 --> 00:51:38.458
to send our report to trigger
the Kepler homecoming...

324
00:51:41.667 --> 00:51:44.708
and they rebelled.
erupted in violence

325
00:51:44.792 --> 00:51:47.083
destroyed everything
including the Ulysses 1

326
00:51:47.417 --> 00:51:49.458
our only means
of communication.

327
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.042
It was...

328
00:51:52.792 --> 00:51:53.958
mystifying...

329
00:51:54.375 --> 00:51:56.292
after we'd offered them so much.

330
00:51:58.792 --> 00:52:00.542
Stafford was killed that day...

331
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.375
and so was your father.

332
00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:12.042
It's so dangerous here. we've
been forced to arm ourselves.

333
00:52:12.583 --> 00:52:15.125
We found weapons in one of
the abandoned ships.

334
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:17.500
But we're running out
of arsenal.

335
00:52:17.583 --> 00:52:18.875
Daddy?

336
00:52:19.667 --> 00:52:21.417
Can I give her a present?

337
00:52:24.542 --> 00:52:25.583
Come.

338
00:52:29.875 --> 00:52:31.458
It's a Space Shuttle.

339
00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.917
I had a bit of trouble
with the nose cone.

340
00:52:37.875 --> 00:52:38.917
Very nice. Neil

341
00:52:39.083 --> 00:52:41.583
but off you go now.
with your mother.

342
00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:55.000
He's excited you came.

343
00:52:56.333 --> 00:52:57.625
Is he your son?

344
00:52:58.708 --> 00:52:59.750
I adopted him.

345
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:02.500
What's the situation on Kepler?

346
00:53:02.792 --> 00:53:03.958
Much worse.

347
00:53:04.542 --> 00:53:06.875
All reproductive technology
efforts failed

348
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.167
for both men and women.

349
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.083
Well...

350
00:53:15.208 --> 00:53:18.042
it's imperative now
that we bring our people

351
00:53:18.458 --> 00:53:20.292
and realise
your father's vision.

352
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.417
How do we handle
Kepler's arrival?

353
00:53:26.583 --> 00:53:29.625
Tide waters. mudflats.
unstable sediment

354
00:53:29.708 --> 00:53:31.375
make it extremely complex.

355
00:53:44.833 --> 00:53:47.250
A dam across
the mouth of the estuary.

356
00:53:47.708 --> 00:53:49.917
This way. we'll finally
hold back the sea.

357
00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:53.125
But the rebellion
set back our progress.

358
00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.292
Almost all the work
had to stop.

359
00:53:55.792 --> 00:53:57.042
Are those turbines?

360
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:02.000
Your father realised the tides
might provide a source of...

361
00:54:02.083 --> 00:54:03.458
Hydroelectricity.

362
00:54:05.458 --> 00:54:07.792
He knew the constant
ebb and flow of the water

363
00:54:07.875 --> 00:54:09.583
could power a whole community.

364
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.167
It's not just for us.

365
00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:16.125
Have you noticed how hardly any
of the Muds is older than 30?

366
00:54:16.917 --> 00:54:18.833
It's the conditions
they live under.

367
00:54:18.958 --> 00:54:21.583
Twice a day.
stricken by mist and tide.

368
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:26.333
We have to take care
of future generations.

369
00:54:26.917 --> 00:54:28.583
Give them the...

370
00:54:29.292 --> 00:54:31.083
...the chance of civilisation.

371
00:54:32.375 --> 00:54:33.417
Sir?

372
00:54:35.875 --> 00:54:37.083
Cabin is ready.

373
00:54:47.583 --> 00:54:51.083
The shower works.
but the water's a bit cloudy.

374
00:54:52.958 --> 00:54:55.500
Right. I'll leave you
for the night.

375
00:54:56.583 --> 00:54:57.750
Gibson.

376
00:55:01.917 --> 00:55:02.875
Thank you.

377
00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:05.542
I'm so pleased that
you're here with us now.

378
00:55:29.333 --> 00:55:31.000
For the many.

379
00:55:31.875 --> 00:55:33.167
For the many.

380
00:55:34.542 --> 00:55:35.708
For the many.

381
00:55:36.292 --> 00:55:37.917
Carbon dioxide...

382
00:55:38.875 --> 00:55:40.000
oxygen...

383
00:55:40.708 --> 00:55:42.042
water vapour?

384
00:55:42.583 --> 00:55:43.917
Very good. and?

385
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.167
- Nitrogen?
- Nitrogen. Very good.

386
00:55:46.375 --> 00:55:49.625
See that orange glow is made
out of tiny atoms of carbon.

387
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.250
Can you imagine that moment...

388
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.500
when humans
first discovered fire?

389
00:56:02.542 --> 00:56:05.000
Suddenly. we could
control the elements.

390
00:57:16.542 --> 00:57:18.417
I brought you
some fresh clothes.

391
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:21.667
Thank you.

392
00:57:50.708 --> 00:57:51.875
Children.

393
00:57:54.792 --> 00:57:57.625
We have an incredibly
special visitor today.

394
00:57:58.125 --> 00:58:00.333
Shh. shh. shh!

395
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:04.708
Children. this is Louise Blake.

396
00:58:04.792 --> 00:58:06.208
Would you like
to say something?

397
00:58:06.958 --> 00:58:10.125
- Welcome. Miss Blake.
- Very good.

398
00:58:10.708 --> 00:58:13.375
We will perform
what we've learnt.

399
00:58:14.083 --> 00:58:15.208
Stand up.

400
00:58:17.208 --> 00:58:20.250
They've waited a long time
to perform for a Kepler.

401
00:58:22.292 --> 00:58:23.208
And...

402
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:26.708
♪ We were lost. alone in space ♪

403
00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:30.375
♪ So far from home
in airless waste ♪

404
00:58:30.958 --> 00:58:34.333
♪ Alone within
our star-filled dome ♪

405
00:58:34.875 --> 00:58:38.417
♪ No countryside
in which to roam ♪

406
00:58:39.042 --> 00:58:43.000
♪ We endured
that we may endure ♪

407
00:58:43.208 --> 00:58:46.292
♪ To make our destiny secure ♪

408
00:58:46.708 --> 00:58:50.333
♪ To find a land of hope
and plenty ♪

409
00:58:50.667 --> 00:58:53.375
♪ For the many. for the many ♪

410
00:58:53.458 --> 00:58:54.667
Well done. children.

411
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:55.750
Sit down now.

412
00:58:56.208 --> 00:58:58.292
Do you mind if they ask you
a few questions?

413
00:58:58.583 --> 00:58:59.958
- No. of course.
- Sit.

414
00:59:01.667 --> 00:59:03.250
- Any questions?
- Sir!

415
00:59:03.542 --> 00:59:04.833
- Mr Gibson!
- Damek.

416
00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:07.208
Can you swim on Kepler?

417
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:10.500
We have simulation pools.
but there's no...

418
00:59:11.417 --> 00:59:12.958
lake or oceans.

419
00:59:13.042 --> 00:59:15.375
- Do you like it here?
- Yes.

420
00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:18.417
I like it here. I mean. it's
a bit wet sometimes. but...

421
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.583
Remember on Kepler. it's dry.
and it's arid. very rocky

422
00:59:24.333 --> 00:59:27.250
so when you go outside.
you need to wear a respirator

423
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:29.500
and people live

424
00:59:29.625 --> 00:59:31.792
inside these huge...

425
00:59:32.292 --> 00:59:34.042
- Biodomes.
- Well done. Lexi!

426
00:59:34.208 --> 00:59:36.875
Very good. Any more questions?

427
00:59:37.458 --> 00:59:38.708
Do you miss home?

428
00:59:44.708 --> 00:59:47.292
Well. actually. I'm hoping that
this could become my home.

429
00:59:47.958 --> 00:59:49.000
Any more questions?

430
00:59:51.542 --> 00:59:53.167
No. that... that's enough.

431
00:59:53.292 --> 00:59:54.333
That's enough. I think.

432
00:59:54.417 --> 00:59:56.042
What do you want to say.
children?

433
00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:58.750
Thank you. Miss Blake!

434
01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:15.750
Why aren't you at school?

435
01:00:16.042 --> 01:00:17.625
I get private lessons.

436
01:00:27.417 --> 01:00:28.875
Are you good at maths?

437
01:00:30.542 --> 01:00:31.542
Test me.

438
01:00:34.583 --> 01:00:37.458
What's 83 times 76?

439
01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:40.917
6.308.

440
01:00:49.792 --> 01:00:52.542
What's 67 times 54?

441
01:00:54.708 --> 01:00:56.792
3.618.

442
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.583
Do you want to know a secret?

443
01:01:29.792 --> 01:01:31.542
It's called a "tree".

444
01:01:40.125 --> 01:01:42.625
Do you know. they used to be
as big as me...

445
01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:45.750
and everywhere?

446
01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:50.042
Imagine...

447
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.083
- Who taught you this?
- What?

448
01:01:55.167 --> 01:01:56.250
The tree.

449
01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:01.417
Christopher Columbus.

450
01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:06.917
He lives in a cabin
next to the engine room.

451
01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:11.792
I talk to him
through the pipes.

452
01:02:14.458 --> 01:02:15.500
Show me.

453
01:02:17.417 --> 01:02:19.000
I'm not allowed to go there.

454
01:04:03.792 --> 01:04:05.458
I'm sorry I lied to you.

455
01:04:09.208 --> 01:04:10.417
Why is he in there?

456
01:04:12.083 --> 01:04:14.208
- Give me a chance to explain.
- Just tell me why?

457
01:04:20.458 --> 01:04:22.167
The rebellion I told you about.

458
01:04:23.667 --> 01:04:25.917
It wasn't the Muds who led it.
it was your father.

459
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:29.958
- You're lying.
- No. Blake.

460
01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:32.958
Why would he do that?

461
01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:36.417
He fell in love...

462
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:39.958
with a Mud woman.

463
01:04:42.167 --> 01:04:44.000
Forgot whose side he was on.
I guess.

464
01:04:50.667 --> 01:04:51.750
Open the door.

465
01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:27.625
Papa.

466
01:05:28.042 --> 01:05:29.167
Louise.

467
01:05:31.125 --> 01:05:32.375
Oh. Louise.

468
01:05:39.292 --> 01:05:41.375
I missed you so much.

469
01:05:51.667 --> 01:05:52.875
Louise...

470
01:05:56.875 --> 01:05:58.000
I'm sorry.

471
01:05:59.333 --> 01:06:00.375
Papa.

472
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:06.917
Is it true?

473
01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:11.583
You betrayed us?

474
01:06:20.792 --> 01:06:22.958
Fifteen years I waited
to hear from you.

475
01:06:23.375 --> 01:06:25.500
I did everything to be sent
on this mission

476
01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:27.417
just to know what had
happened to you.

477
01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:29.708
And you gave up on me?

478
01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:33.375
I did.

479
01:06:35.667 --> 01:06:37.083
You gave up on Kepler?

480
01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:41.083
Why?

481
01:06:43.292 --> 01:06:44.500
I had to stop it.

482
01:06:46.167 --> 01:06:48.250
- Stop what?
- The mistakes.

483
01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:53.750
I don't understand.

484
01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.167
Can't you see
what's going on here?

485
01:07:04.083 --> 01:07:05.875
Kepler shouldn't come back.
Louise.

486
01:07:06.333 --> 01:07:08.250
None of us
should have come back.

487
01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:15.417
Louise!

488
01:07:38.375 --> 01:07:41.083
He ruined everything we'd
worked so hard to achieve.

489
01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:45.833
In the end. nothing changes
the fact he's still from Kepler.

490
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:50.083
That's the Henderson Hub?

491
01:07:53.167 --> 01:07:55.125
They wanted to
destroy that. too.

492
01:07:55.458 --> 01:07:56.667
But we stopped them.

493
01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.917
I'll transmit from there.

494
01:08:00.417 --> 01:08:02.042
It's just a weather station.

495
01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:04.083
But it's intact. right?

496
01:08:04.833 --> 01:08:06.708
I could connect
the biometer to it.

497
01:08:08.458 --> 01:08:09.667
And send what?

498
01:08:09.875 --> 01:08:12.583
Kepler wants proof that
we could procreate here.

499
01:08:16.957 --> 01:08:19.375
It looks like my TSH levels
have recovered.

500
01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:26.582
We'll find the biometer.

501
01:08:27.667 --> 01:08:29.000
I'll send Paling now.

502
01:08:32.332 --> 01:08:34.832
Our predecessors failed us
in so many ways

503
01:08:35.457 --> 01:08:38.125
but this was one of
their greatest inventions.

504
01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:47.957
- For the many.
- For the many.

505
01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:58.957
Again?

506
01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:00.625
- Soup!
- Neil.

507
01:09:03.667 --> 01:09:04.832
<i>Dyen korse.</i>

508
01:09:05.832 --> 01:09:07.875
I'm still learning
their language.

509
01:09:08.417 --> 01:09:10.332
The vocabulary is remarkable.
They have...

510
01:09:10.667 --> 01:09:12.500
thirteen different words
for water.

511
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.417
Fourteen. Daddy.

512
01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.625
It depends on what it does.

513
01:09:17.042 --> 01:09:18.667
Saltwater.

514
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.500
Drinking water.

515
01:09:20.875 --> 01:09:23.042
- Floodwater...
- You know what. Neil?

516
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.625
You should be our interpreter
when they come.

517
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:27.832
I don't want to be
an interpreter.

518
01:09:27.917 --> 01:09:31.875
I want to be an astronaut.
saving people's lives.

519
01:09:32.082 --> 01:09:35.167
You're thinking of a superhero.
not an astronaut.

520
01:09:35.457 --> 01:09:36.957
He found some old comics.

521
01:09:37.542 --> 01:09:39.250
But you saved my life.

522
01:09:40.957 --> 01:09:42.707
Your favourite story. isn't it?

523
01:09:44.542 --> 01:09:47.250
Munay. why don't you
tell it to Blake?

524
01:09:53.167 --> 01:09:55.042
When I delivered Neil

525
01:09:56.083 --> 01:09:57.167
his...

526
01:09:58.333 --> 01:09:59.500
"Naelsnora"?

527
01:10:00.542 --> 01:10:01.833
Umbilical cord.

528
01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:06.875
It was wrapped around his neck.

529
01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:10.542
Out there. in the ocean

530
01:10:10.625 --> 01:10:13.375
both Neil and I
would be dead now.

531
01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:18.958
This man saved our life.

532
01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:23.792
He cut my stomach open.
got the baby out

533
01:10:24.792 --> 01:10:26.042
treated my wounds.

534
01:10:26.708 --> 01:10:29.000
And then he made us
into his family.

535
01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:31.375
Dramatic way to start a family.

536
01:10:32.917 --> 01:10:35.042
- Fish balls!
- Neil...

537
01:10:36.583 --> 01:10:37.542
No. Neil!

538
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:40.208
Use a knife and fork.

539
01:10:41.167 --> 01:10:43.083
You're a civilised human being.
for God's sake.

540
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.292
Oh. don't worry.
it's just a blackout.

541
01:10:50.042 --> 01:10:51.542
Happens from time to time.

542
01:10:57.458 --> 01:11:00.167
Sir. we were looking
for the biometer

543
01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:01.708
when there
has been an intrusion.

544
01:11:01.792 --> 01:11:03.417
Someone took out the guards
by the generators

545
01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:04.667
and killed the power.

546
01:11:05.208 --> 01:11:06.583
Secure this floor.

547
01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:08.583
Have all guards check
every entrance.

548
01:11:08.917 --> 01:11:10.292
- Yes. sir.
- You take Neil

549
01:11:10.375 --> 01:11:11.458
lock yourself in.

550
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:12.750
Mummy?

551
01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:15.667
- I'll check the corridors.
- You're safest in your room.

552
01:11:17.625 --> 01:11:18.708
That's an order.

553
01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.792
Maila. where is she?

554
01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:46.417
Where is she?

555
01:11:47.417 --> 01:11:48.667
Take me to her.

556
01:11:50.417 --> 01:11:51.417
Alright.

557
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:53.375
OK.

558
01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:22.250
Maila?

559
01:12:26.167 --> 01:12:27.292
<i>Huej!</i>

560
01:12:27.667 --> 01:12:29.208
<i>Naskiratsi tsi strap pissot!</i>

561
01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:31.458
- <i>Huej!</i>
- Maila!

562
01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.375
Ma! Ma!

563
01:12:36.125 --> 01:12:37.125
Mama!

564
01:12:38.042 --> 01:12:39.500
Mama!

565
01:12:39.708 --> 01:12:41.875
<i>Lemnach ma Mama ensama!</i>

566
01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:44.875
What the fuck
is going on here? Enough!

567
01:12:46.667 --> 01:12:47.750
Ma!

568
01:12:52.417 --> 01:12:54.375
Narvik.

569
01:12:55.083 --> 01:12:56.667
- Stop!
- Mama!

570
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:58.458
Stop it! You stop it!

571
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.125
Mama!

572
01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:01.500
What did you say?

573
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.375
Take this thing away.

574
01:13:06.667 --> 01:13:09.042
<i>Lemnach ma Mama ensama!</i>

575
01:13:09.375 --> 01:13:11.792
<i>Lemnach ma Mama ensama!</i>

576
01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:15.417
They only take the girls.

577
01:13:20.167 --> 01:13:22.292
Mama! Mama!

578
01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:25.833
Mama!

579
01:13:26.333 --> 01:13:27.500
Are you OK?

580
01:13:46.042 --> 01:13:47.208
You will be fine.

581
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:52.917
- What will happen to her?
- Shh.

582
01:13:54.167 --> 01:13:55.958
Better if we are not talking.

583
01:14:28.875 --> 01:14:30.292
You have his eyes.

584
01:14:33.833 --> 01:14:35.167
How's the throat?

585
01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.542
I'll survive.

586
01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:51.625
I'm sorry you got
caught up in all this.

587
01:14:52.708 --> 01:14:54.750
Narvik has quite a temper.

588
01:14:55.292 --> 01:14:56.500
You know her name?

589
01:14:57.208 --> 01:14:59.417
She was one of the guards
who turned against us.

590
01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.333
They hate us.

591
01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:08.917
She just wanted her daughter.

592
01:15:11.375 --> 01:15:12.958
She's a Kepler daughter now.

593
01:15:17.667 --> 01:15:18.875
Why only girls?

594
01:15:21.208 --> 01:15:22.375
Let me ask you this.

595
01:15:23.667 --> 01:15:26.667
What's the average age
of our females back home?

596
01:15:27.458 --> 01:15:30.208
Maybe late. mid-40s?

597
01:15:31.167 --> 01:15:32.833
Assuming they leave now

598
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.958
most of them will be
in their 50s

599
01:15:35.042 --> 01:15:36.417
by the time they arrive.

600
01:15:37.125 --> 01:15:38.667
Do the maths. Blake.

601
01:15:39.208 --> 01:15:41.417
Even if their fertility
is restored

602
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.875
it'll be too late
for most of them to conceive.

603
01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:47.833
We need a diverse
and vigorous gene pool.

604
01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:49.167
They are children.

605
01:15:49.958 --> 01:15:52.417
They won't be by the time
our people arrive.

606
01:15:55.667 --> 01:15:57.083
So is this our mission?

607
01:15:57.708 --> 01:15:59.833
To ensure we don't die out?
Absolutely.

608
01:16:00.208 --> 01:16:01.708
In case you didn't notice.
Gibson

609
01:16:01.792 --> 01:16:03.833
the human race doesn't
actually need us to survive.

610
01:16:03.917 --> 01:16:05.458
You sound just
like your father.

611
01:16:06.542 --> 01:16:07.833
They're not like us.

612
01:16:08.833 --> 01:16:11.208
We can repopulate our planet.

613
01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.417
Our current predicament

614
01:16:15.167 --> 01:16:17.042
calls for a measure
of expediency.

615
01:16:17.667 --> 01:16:19.708
If you have an alternative.
please...

616
01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:21.625
enlighten me.

617
01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:29.208
Paling.

618
01:16:29.708 --> 01:16:30.958
It was on the tugboat.

619
01:16:31.667 --> 01:16:32.750
Thank you.

620
01:16:35.125 --> 01:16:38.167
Now. Paling is a perfect
example of a Mud

621
01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:40.208
who worked out
what's best for him.

622
01:16:46.583 --> 01:16:47.708
Where is it?

623
01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:50.458
- Where is it?
- It must be back at the camp.

624
01:16:50.583 --> 01:16:52.125
- Daddy. Daddy!
- Shut up!

625
01:16:56.167 --> 01:16:59.000
When the tide comes in.
you and Paling...

626
01:16:59.583 --> 01:17:02.458
you're gonna go back there
and find the damn thing.

627
01:17:06.375 --> 01:17:07.500
And Narvik?

628
01:17:12.458 --> 01:17:14.208
She'll be executed at dawn.

629
01:17:19.792 --> 01:17:21.583
Are you still with us. Blake?

630
01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:27.458
Yes. sir.

631
01:17:32.583 --> 01:17:33.917
Keep an eye on her.

632
01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:44.500
What's that?

633
01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:11.750
Hey.

634
01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:13.167
What are you doing here?

635
01:18:14.958 --> 01:18:16.083
Blake!

636
01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:34.792
Listen to me.

637
01:18:37.125 --> 01:18:38.625
We're gonna find your mother.

638
01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:41.292
Ma?

639
01:18:41.375 --> 01:18:42.458
Yes. Ma.

640
01:18:42.542 --> 01:18:45.125
Open the door!

641
01:18:46.167 --> 01:18:48.333
It's alright. Just wait here.

642
01:18:51.083 --> 01:18:52.250
Stay there.

643
01:18:55.792 --> 01:18:57.792
Captain's order. open!

644
01:19:07.708 --> 01:19:08.958
I have to search your cabin.

645
01:19:11.042 --> 01:19:12.542
One of the girls is missing.

646
01:20:08.458 --> 01:20:09.500
I'm curious.

647
01:20:11.417 --> 01:20:13.292
What was it like
being on Kepler...

648
01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:15.583
with no one?

649
01:20:17.167 --> 01:20:19.458
Must make a woman hungry...

650
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:22.250
to feel life inside.

651
01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.583
Have a seat.

652
01:20:43.333 --> 01:20:44.458
Come.

653
01:21:18.708 --> 01:21:19.667
Paling!

654
01:21:55.417 --> 01:21:56.458
Let's go.

655
01:22:34.792 --> 01:22:36.208
<i>Varidi es hou heir?</i>

656
01:22:36.708 --> 01:22:39.833
<i>Con vous yjelp mezure
fjyend dai tochlett?</i>

657
01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:44.500
<i>Vous net hier!</i>

658
01:22:45.417 --> 01:22:46.875
<i>No vous fier! No vous...</i>

659
01:23:15.667 --> 01:23:16.625
Ma!

660
01:23:18.167 --> 01:23:19.292
Maila!

661
01:23:49.917 --> 01:23:50.958
Come!

662
01:24:06.292 --> 01:24:08.208
Mama? Mama?

663
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:21.042
Let's get out of here.

664
01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:24.292
Louise.

665
01:24:26.708 --> 01:24:29.042
What's going on here?
Come and see this.

666
01:24:34.417 --> 01:24:35.875
Why are they going there?

667
01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:39.750
Gibson never leaves the ship.

668
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.417
Never.

669
01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:49.792
How did you get this?

670
01:24:53.917 --> 01:24:56.542
It's Neil.
He sends me surprises.

671
01:25:01.917 --> 01:25:03.500
It was in there all the time.

672
01:25:04.042 --> 01:25:05.625
What? What was?

673
01:25:06.708 --> 01:25:07.833
The biometer.

674
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:11.917
They want the proof
that we can procreate here.

675
01:25:14.708 --> 01:25:16.000
But there's none on there.

676
01:25:16.458 --> 01:25:17.917
No. No!

677
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:21.500
He has the proof.
He has it with him.

678
01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:24.583
- What do you mean? What proof?
- Neil is the proof.

679
01:25:26.042 --> 01:25:27.958
Neil is a Kepler.

680
01:25:28.792 --> 01:25:31.458
Whatever Gibson told you.
it's a lie.

681
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.458
We have to stop him.

682
01:25:39.708 --> 01:25:41.083
You have to stop him.

683
01:25:43.375 --> 01:25:44.458
Louise.

684
01:26:04.583 --> 01:26:05.708
Louise?

685
01:26:09.708 --> 01:26:11.333
I never lit the last one.

686
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Come!

687
01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:27.583
Come!

688
01:27:34.417 --> 01:27:35.458
Go!

689
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.542
Stop it!

690
01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:18.208
- No. please!
- Drop the gun!

691
01:29:18.458 --> 01:29:20.917
- Please!
- He's your own flesh and blood.

692
01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.458
Please!

693
01:29:23.542 --> 01:29:25.000
- Tell her!
- It's true!

694
01:29:25.542 --> 01:29:26.917
He's your brother.

695
01:29:32.125 --> 01:29:33.333
Drop the gun.

696
01:29:36.125 --> 01:29:37.792
- You don't think I'll do it?
- No!

697
01:29:38.083 --> 01:29:39.417
No. please. Gibson!

698
01:29:39.542 --> 01:29:40.833
No! No!

699
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:43.792
Mama!

700
01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:45.667
Drop the gun.

701
01:29:47.708 --> 01:29:49.375
- Drop it!
- Mama!

702
01:29:59.625 --> 01:30:00.833
No. Mama!

703
01:30:01.167 --> 01:30:02.333
Mama!

704
01:30:15.375 --> 01:30:16.542
It's sent!

705
01:31:38.083 --> 01:31:39.500
Wake up!

706
01:31:58.167 --> 01:32:00.542
Wake up!

707
01:32:13.667 --> 01:32:14.667
Blake.

708
01:33:37.208 --> 01:33:38.583
Go to him. Louise.

709
01:33:39.625 --> 01:33:41.042
He trusts you.

710
01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:52.375
Hey...

711
01:33:58.792 --> 01:34:00.000
Can I sit down?

712
01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.583
My father got this
from his father.

713
01:34:22.042 --> 01:34:24.292
He told me it must be
handled with care.

714
01:34:28.458 --> 01:34:29.708
Now it's yours.

715
01:34:40.042 --> 01:34:42.208
He must have named you
after one of them.

716
01:35:02.625 --> 01:35:03.792
Are they coming?

717
01:35:06.375 --> 01:35:07.542
Maybe.

718
01:35:12.125 --> 01:35:13.375
How many?

719
01:35:16.583 --> 01:35:17.792
All of them.

720
01:35:28.458 --> 01:35:30.375
Will they bring some trees?

721
01:35:33.333 --> 01:35:34.500
Possibly.
