00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.520
To all the Freelancers.
independant workers...

4
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.640
Blondie Maxwell never loses

5
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.920
You should add some colour.

6
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.200
Colour?

7
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.280
Yes. Red. yellow. green. Colour. Life.

8
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.240
You sure?

9
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.840
Yes. Add colour.

10
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.696
But it’s a death sentence.

11
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.000
not a birthday card.

12
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.080
Yes.

13
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480
So?

14
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.736
Why don’t we keep it standard?

15
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.960
Classic. Black and white. Sober.

16
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.736
Colours would look kind of frivolous.

17
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.920
Add colour.

18
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.400
Add colour!

19
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.400
As you wish.

20
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.160
A bit cocky. wasn’t he?

21
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.480
He’s an outsider.

22
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.856
Nah…

23
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.880
Yup.

24
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.440
Knobhead.

25
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.760
I’ll tell Marie-Lou to sack him tonight.

26
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.640
What agency’s he from?

27
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.320
Genius Coder.

28
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.536
I’ll give him a shit score.

29
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.880
He’ll never work again.

30
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.960
Too right.

31
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.200
Good morning. gentlemen.

32
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.696
Maintenance sent me
to inspect your servers.

33
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.656
Sure. Last door on the right.

34
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680
Right there.

35
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.416
Thanks. Good day.

36
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.096
Likewise.

37
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120
Thank you.

38
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.240
Several hacking attempts this evening
on servers at Chronos Industries.

39
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.816
Since last week’s attacks
by the terrorist Boloch.

40
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.376
we are seeing an activity
spike in hacking networks.

41
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.016
They are now running
large-scale operations.

42
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.256
Did you read the last
report by the finance guy?

43
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.720
Yup. Slapdash if you ask me.

44
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.536
Who’s he? Not from here. is he?

45
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.176
Security forces are actively searching
the terrorist Boloch and his acolytes.

46
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.656
It was not uninteresting.

47
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.816
Spare me.

48
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.376
Chronos Industries says it is not worried

49
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.656
Sure. But efficiency metrics
on trends like that are tricky.

50
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.657
Hello?

51
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:33.416
And reassures its customers that they
will not be inconvenienced by. I quote.

52
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.736
Especially when the workshops are airtight.

53
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.457
Hello!

54
00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:38.136
Hello? Who do you think you are?
Can’t you see we’re talking?

55
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.296
“the activities of marginal subjects
hankering after bygone days.”

56
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.256
You are a freelancer. an ant. a nobody.

57
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.040
So shut your big gob and…

58
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.080
Thursday 6:00pm
Place: Downtown Flat

59
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.920
Traffic sources comparison

60
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.480
Chronos wants to make death profitable

61
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.080
Was it worth it?

62
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.720
What's wrong?

63
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.760
Who is your source Alex?

64
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.280
You know I can't tell you

65
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400
What is it?

66
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.960
The case of the millenium

67
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.240
Dark Chronos!

68
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.897
What's that?

69
00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:53.440
A smartphone app

70
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.560
What does it do?

71
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.560
Imagine you want to get rid of me…

72
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.760
Tempting!

73
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.680
15 years of marriage. That's exhausting.

74
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.320
Well. this app allows you to order a hitman
to fullfill your wish

75
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.960
as simply as you would order a pizza.
a cab or toy boy

76
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.440
Dear humans. when are you going to wake up?

77
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.577
Is it public?

78
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:20.240
Non. it's hosted deep on
the sub layers of Chronos.

79
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.720
You only access it with sponsorship.

80
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.160
Chronos is behind all this?

81
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.680
I think so yes!

82
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.936
Then stop. we can't publish

83
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.937
Of course we can

84
00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:37.056
Stephane. we can't go up against Chronos

85
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.376
Their legal department is a war machine.

86
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.320
I can't protect you. You will go to prison.

87
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.200
I won't back down this time.

88
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.680
If I have a shot at Chronos. I'm publishing

89
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.120
Once the article is online. i'm safe.

90
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.880
I need a passport. and train ticket out.

91
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.400
You want to leave?

92
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.960
Non. it's not for me

93
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.160
It's for a source.

94
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.040
A trainee from Chronos

95
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.160
She want's to talk.
but she's scared to death

96
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.520
I hope you know what you do

97
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.120
Thursday 6:30pm
Place: Restaurant Gergovia

98
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.360
N ice to see you!

99
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.280
Yes. have a seat.

100
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.240
You’re even more beautiful in real life.

101
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.520
That’s kind.

102
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.416
Good evening!

103
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.440
You ready to order?

104
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.480
I’ll have the vegetable sausage.

105
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.840
And you?

106
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.040
A burger.

107
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.240
Rare.

108
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.240
Coming up.

109
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.200
Well. so… My name is Sam.

110
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.200
And you?

111
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.240
What?

112
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.720
Well. I mean… What’s your name?

113
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.000
Blondie Maxwell.

114
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.520
Blondie

115
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960
Is there a problem?

116
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.280
No. not at all.

117
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.160
What do you do for a living?

118
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.960
I’m a private eye.

119
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.240
Wow! That’s fab!

120
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.320
No. it’s not.

121
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.080
But I’m good at it.
So it's what I do now.

122
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.120
Now?

123
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.040
I’m onto a big fish now.

124
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.800
And a few gigs on the side.

125
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.937
But. when I find him.

126
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:59.440
I get the 3 million reward.

127
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.440
You after Boloch?

128
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.080
Everyone’s after Boloch.

129
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.480
I’m going to find him.

130
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600
And voilà...

131
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.136
The vegetables and the burger.

132
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.160
Thank you.

133
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And…

134
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.360
What else are you doing right now?

135
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.040
Just is shitty little job.

136
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.440
Tell me!

137
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.880
A wanker who hacked the CRNews website

138
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.440
Oh. yes. I heard about that.

139
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.600
You making progress?

140
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.560
Yep. Found him.

141
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.856
This can go two ways.

142
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.296
I drag you to the judge.

143
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.416
I get my pathetic reward.

144
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.760
you get 20 years.

145
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.560
The other option:

146
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.520
"Boloch - Dead or Alive"

147
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.800
I don’t know him!

148
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.400
I really don’t!

149
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.960
What are you doing here?

150
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.240
Who’s that?

151
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.320
Shit. Hector. I got here first!

152
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.280
Hector. you can’t do that!

153
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.880
He didn’t get the memo!

154
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.456
He’s my source! My source!

155
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.840
You can’t just turn up and take him!

156
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.120
Where is Boloch?

157
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.840
I swear I don’t know!

158
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.400
He uses my servers to send his
crypted text messages. That's it!

159
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.120
I couldn’t say no.
He’s a legend to me. a god!

160
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.760
Give me your phone!

161
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.136
Will he leave me alone?

162
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.160
Yeah.

163
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.480
You’re worthless. Sam.

164
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.640
Your reward’s not even 50.

165
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.000
Not much. even for me.

166
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.360
So I can go?

167
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.480
You joking?

168
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.040
You’re going to help me find Boloch.

169
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.016
Insufficient funds for €55 cheque cashed 27/02/2020
4:30 am on account XXX253. Rejection warning.

170
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.960
Your balance is €50.
You have 24 hours to supply funds.

171
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.440
You been here long?

172
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.760
Just arrived.

173
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.840
How’s your case going?

174
00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.680
A dead end... for now.

175
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.360
What about your budget?

176
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.800
I’ll manage. don’t worry.

177
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.800
When I get the reward we’re out of here.

178
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.160
Hurry up. we’re running late.

179
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240
No. Clara…

180
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.416
I don’t want to go.

181
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.417
Why?

182
00:13:15.441 --> 00:13:17.800
I have nothing to wear.
look like shit. smell like shit.

183
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920
Wear this.

184
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.600
I’ll look like…

185
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.080
A stunner!

186
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.776

Yes. it's online.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.840
I have nothing to fear anymore…

235
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.496
… It’s never easy to know.

236
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.976
Do you think they might have
wiretapped my classroom?

237
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.840
No. not classrooms. Really?
- I don’t think so.

238
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.840
What?

239
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.936
I don’t know. it was a bit too easy.

240
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.360
They guy leaves digital
footprints everywhere.

241
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.640
Everything points to him.

242
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.000
All the free-access data points to him.
No exceptions.

243
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.216

00:19:25.241 --> 00:19:26.336
That’s unbelievable.

246
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.840
The guy covers his tracks.

247
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.360
but leaves his gene pool in the victim…

248
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.320
And there’s no way that girl was an escort.

249
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.120
Shit. Blondie. what are you saying?

250
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.936
Give me another 150
and I’ll run the sperm DNA.

251
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.400
No way. If I give you 150 I’ll lose money.

252
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.520
120?

253
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.120
You want to get paid or not?

00:19:43.161 --> 00:19:44.520
Then drop it.

256
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.720
We put him away and
you get paid in an hour.

257
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.096
My friends! Let’s think about
something else for two minutes…

258
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.096
Yes!

What do you want?

263
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.400
Yes. almost done.

264
00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.720
I’ll be there as soon as we close the case.

265
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.960
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.800
Yes.

267
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.760
Please sign.

270
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.720
I need to call my lawyer.

271
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.576
Honestly. madam. I wouldn’t.

272
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.976
The case is solid.

273
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.216
Your husband is the only suspect
in an extremely serious crime.

274
00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.440
He’s going down.

275
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.680
Call your insurance.
Cover as much of the fine as you can.

276
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.880
Do you have insurance?

277
00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:05.840
Yes.

278
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.296
Good. Call now. Forward the receipt.

279
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.880
They’ll take all necessary measures
to provide adequate support.

280
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.320
Get back on your feet now. madam.

281
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.416
But Stéphane…

282
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.280

283
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.200

284
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.520
Yes?

285
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.360

Yes. don’t worry.

289
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.840
How’s it going?

290
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Not bad.

291
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.536
I’ve sold a few.

292
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.560
The people seem happy.

293
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.920
I’m proud of you.

294
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280
Thank you.

295
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.480
What’s wrong?

296
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.680
Nothing.

297
00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.520
You thought he’d come?

298
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.760
No.

299
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.800
I mean. yes.

300
00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.240
I really wanted to meet him tonight.

301
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.720
It would have been perfect.

302
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.400
You still writing to him?

303
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.240
A text message a day.

304
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.720
It’s like a diary.

305
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560
He never answers.

306
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.480
He just sends me money.

307
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.920
Great relationship.

308
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.560
It’s pathetic.

309
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.680
Enjoy your party.

310
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.160

Stephane Maleb. from Medialeaks

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.280
has just been arrested for the
presumed murder of a prostitute downtown.

317
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.936
Maleb was known for his freedom of speech.
and the controversies he liked to trigger.

318
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.616
and he is now reaching the end of the line.

319
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.840
His unconventional methods. and doubtful
sources has always been denounced.

320
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.120
And we are just hearing right now...

321
00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:01.040
that the medialeaks computer servers are being placed
under judicial control by the private judge Kleber.

322
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.376

325

You ran the investigation?

326
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.200
I didn’t kill her.

327
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.520
I didn’t rape her.

328
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.480
I didn’t even touch her.

329
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.560
Why didn’t you run the DNA test?

330
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.920
I can’t afford to.

331
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.480
They don’t pay me much.

332
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.400
And all the clues point to you.

333
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.960
I can’t help it.

334
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.400
What clues?

335
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.280
The escort account logs. For example.

336
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.120
You were the poor girl’s last customer.

337
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.120
She wasn’t an escort: she was my source.

338
00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.440
I was investigating Chronos.

339
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.000
She wanted to testify.

340
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.680
Her father helped develop
the Dark Chronos app.

341
00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.840
He was found dead too.

342
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.960
They want to muzzle me.

343
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.496
Dark Chronos?

344
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.040
You heard of it?

345
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.080
You have to help me.

346
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.600
If I go into this room.
we both know I won’t come out.

347
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.520
There’s nothing I can do.
- Yes. there is.

348
00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.760
You can talk to judge Hardy.
try to convince him…

349
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.360
Run the DNA test.

350
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.120
A 12-year-old kid could see it’s a setup.

351
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.680
I know.

352
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Are you freelance?

353
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440
Who isn't?

354
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.240
What platform?

355
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.800
SmartMonkey? ClueMaster?

356
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.160
They all belong to Chronos Industries.

357
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.040
I don’t belong to anyone.

358
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.080
Let me guess: money problems?

359
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.640
Ask yourself this:

360
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.840
How would you have worked
the case if you weren’t broke?

361
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.640
Hey! Hi Blondie!

362
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.480
Hi Fabrice. You’re early.

363
00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.800
Judge Hardy called me himself.
He wants this sorted immediately.

364
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.040
I’m begging you!

365
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.200
Right. all done.
Excellent report. Blondie.

366
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.360
Ah. Hello Fabrice.
Are you well?

367
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.400

371
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.800
I think we need to
review the investigation.

372
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.800
You talked to him. didn't you?

373
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.920
Yes. And he’s making some sense.

374
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.960
We need to check the DNA.

375
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.257
He’s playing you. Blondie!

376
00:28:51.281 --> 00:28:53.200
It’s his job to play feeble minds.

377
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.920
No. I don’t know.
I think he’s telling the truth.

378
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.560
Blondie. I’m not paying for the DNA test.

379
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.920

I’ll do the paperwork. promise!

383
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.280
Let me earn some money
back and I’ll pay for the DNA test.

384

391
00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.080
Blondie. do you really expect a good score
when you’ve done something like this?

392

Shit. Hardy. I’ll never
work again if you do that!

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.840
You did nothing!

549
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.800
Stood there like a twat and did nothing.

550
00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.840
I will destroy you. you hear me?

551
00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.680
Fucking destroy you!

552
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.680
That’s for making me wait.

553
00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.480
I soiled myself.

554
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.280
I’m sorry. mate.

555
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.400
What did Boloch want?

556
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.080
The Chronos server coordinates.

557
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.360
All the servers. access codes.
my passwords…

558
00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.520
I gave him everything.

559
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.120
I thought he’d kill me…

560
00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.336
Mach2: Rendez-vous

561
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.056
Disneyland: Funfair

562
00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.960
Travolta: Tonight

563
00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.720
Alexandra Maleb.

564
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
I don’t understand.

565
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.856
The journalist's wife. She
knows Boloch. He is the source.

566
00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.161
She is going to meet him at
the the funfair. Wiretap her!

567
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.760
She’s on the phone.

568
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.120
With who?

569
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.320
Encrypted number.

570
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:24.800
Got sound?

571
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.840
Coming up.

572
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.656
They came in. blasting the door.
hitting everyone and the took Stéphane

573
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.856
- Calm down
- I don't know where he is.
- Please Alex. calm down.

574
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.056
- We need to find him. How
the fuck could I calm down.

575
00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.296
Help me please.
- Breathe

576
00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.456
- I can't Breathe
- Listen to me for fuck sake.

577
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.576
Fuck me. it’s Boloch.

578
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.776
We need to find a solution.
- Oh. fuck.

579
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:40.776
- I can't help. There is no way.

580
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.816
- No I'm sorry.
- Yes you can
- No. no. no.

581
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.936
- We should never have listen to you
- Calm down. please calm down.

582
00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.056
We should never have listen to you.

583
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.696
- Don't say that.
- You have to help me. Please!

584
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:52.120
- We can't leave him.
- I can't help you. I just can't.

585
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.496
- You know it's over.
- No

586
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.680
- It's the end. there is nothing we can do.
- No

587
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.320
- They executed him. He is dead.
- No

588
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.856
I’m opening an arrest mission on her.

589
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.120
I have enough to take her down.

590
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.920
Can you locate him?

591
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.560
No. he scrambles everything.

592
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.576
The tracker is losing it.

593
00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.497
- They're coming for me.

594
00:47:09.521 --> 00:47:12.376
- I'm in danger!
Fucking museum phones.

595
00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.400
I need the train ticket.

596
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.760
Traffic jams on the ring road.

597
00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.520
The tactical team’s 15 minutes out.

598
00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.120
OK. Stay on Alexandra.

599
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.680
He’ll call her back.

600
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.400
She’s moving.

601
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.400
Approaching.

602
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:19.960
Next left.

603
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.240
She’s right there.

604
00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.320
I see her.

605
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.800
The squad’s nowhere near.

606
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.360
Back off. I’ve got her.

607
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.936
No caller ID. It’s him.

608
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:49.960
Plug me in.

609
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.360
Yes

610
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.360
The pillars by the river.

611
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.520
He hung up.

612
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.960
She’s heading for the river.

613
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.520
We’re there.

614
00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.360
Perfect. It’s the ideal location.

615
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.160
The squad will be there any second.

616
00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.360
We’ll pick him up on the stairs.

617
00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:56.760
What?

618
00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:58.776
He's calling back!

619
00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.537
What did you say?

620
00:49:59.561 --> 00:50:00.616
What?
- Boloch?

621
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.456
Got the tickets?

622
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.480
Yes

623
00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.696
- What do yo mean?
- I'm sorry for everything.

624
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.936
You said it was the ideal location.

625
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.656
Sorry about Stéphane. and the girl.
- So?

626
00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:07.816
It's all my fault.
- Why did you say that?

627
00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.576
- Because the stairs are on the waterfront.
- Drop your phone

628
00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.536
he tactical squad is coming on the waterfront.
- Your jacket. your bag

629
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.176
and run to the tramway as fast as you can.

630
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200
What did he say?
- But...

631
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:18.696
Now. Alexandra!

632
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.376
Blondie. what’s going on?

633
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.136
It makes no sense.
Why go somewhere he’s so easy to catch?

634
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.840
Wait wait! What are you saying?

635
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.936
He can see us!

636
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.960
And hear you.

637
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.120
Well. Hector.

638
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.800
do you think you can catch me?

639
00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.600
You came very close last time.

640
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:45.680
You know what I like about you. Hector?
Your loyalty.

641
00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.520
You never let me go.

642
00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.056
Blondie Talk to me!

643
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.536
He fucked us! He's at the ferris wheel. Your
men are coming from the wrong side of the fair.

644
00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.616
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

645
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.880
We’ve known each other
for what? 15 years? 20 years?

646
00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.000
And you’re still on my arse.

647
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.120
Nothing personal.

648
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.000
I like to see a job well done.

649
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.360
You murdered my wife.

650
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.600
You. deep shit.

651
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.400
I found this rather personal.

652
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.096
It’s nearly over.

653
00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.520
You don't understand. You never have.
You will never catch me.

654
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.480
You're far too studid for that.

655
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.520
I. on the other hand. know you very well.

656
00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.800
I know all about you.

657
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.920
I know you IQ. your passwords.

658
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.040
your favorite meals.

659
00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.720
I know you work for Pat Fredericks.

660
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.600
I know you work for Chronos.

661
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.360
You might be the world best Freelancer.

662
00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.920
but there's nothing in your head.

663
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.000
I even know how fast you run.

664
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.640
And I knew that you would
rush into that bloody ferris wheel.

665
00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.320
Danger. Explosive.

666
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.480
Fuck!

667
00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.840
BOLOCH
Friday 04:00am
Place: the outskirt

668
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:15.320
Identify suspect?

669
00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.360
Target approved

670
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.080
What do you want from me?

671
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.840
Fucking untie me!

672
00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.240
Calm down and watch.

673
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.880
What?

674
00:53:58.680 --> 00:53:59.800
The billboards.

675
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.720
It’s everywhere.

676
00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.040
What do you want?

677
00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.200
To fix a mistake.

678
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000
What mistake?

679
00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.720
Have you ever been in a polling station.
Blondie?

680
00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.160
I’m too young.

681
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.280
At your age. I’d voted 6 times.

682
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.240
We stopped voting years ago.

683
00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.560
And nobody noticed.

684
00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:37.480
Nobody cares.

685
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.800
I don’t understand.

686
00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.720
If nobody votes. who’s governing?

687
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:46.720
Chronos.

688
00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.600
Who governs Chronos?

689
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.280
Nobody governs Chronos. Blondie.

690
00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.840
Chronos isn’t a person.

691
00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.320
It’s a machine.

692
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.840
An algorithm.

693
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.480
And you created it?

694
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.360
What happened?

695
00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.416
I was working on an update
to humanise its judgement.

696
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.800
It was sometimes too radical.
too pragmatic.

697
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.920
I think that’s why it reacted.

698
00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:31.960
What did it do?

699
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:39.240
One evening. I got home and
found my wife dead. A bullet in her head.

700
00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:45.520
The police got there at the same time.
I barely had time to run and disappear.

701
00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.360
Then I watched Chronos
extend its grip over our society.

702
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.640
take over our biggest companies.
our institutions.

703
00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:56.480
all our screens…

704
00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.160
And our minds.

705
00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.680
That’s fucked up.

706
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.240
I created it to help us.

707
00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.200
It analysed us.

708
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.560
And concluded that we
needed a nice fat dictatorship.

709
00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.280
I’ve spent months trying to destroy it.

710
00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:28.200
I’ve destroyed every known
server and it’s still running.

711
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.120
I don’t get it!

712
00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.240
It will connect you to me soon.

713
00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.400
I didn’t do anything.

714
00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.080
You ask too many questions. Blondie.

715
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.040
You should run. leave the country.

716
00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.400
I can’t afford to.

717
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.000
Get out of here.

718
00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.200
I have a life here.

719
00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.240
With that you can have
a life somewhere else.

720
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.040
Where?

721
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.880
Anywhere. As far away as possible.

722
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.760
Somewhere there are no connections.
There must be some left.

723
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.160
Boloch?

724
00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:26.480
What?

725
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.720
Why are you protecting me?

726
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.560
Suspicious behaviour alert

727
00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:54.640
We remind our valued passengers that smoking
is strictly forbidden in the station.

728
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.120
Clara. I have to…

729
00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:31.200
Oh. no!

730
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.560
No. no. no. no. no!

731
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:45.480
I’ll call you back.

732
01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.880
Dammit!

733
01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.640
New assignment

734
01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.160
Simon.

735
01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.720
I’m busy. Medhi.

736
01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080
Simon.

737
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.360
You need to learn to respect insiders. kid.

738
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.537
Simon.

739
01:00:39.561 --> 01:00:40.760
For fuck’s sake. Medhi!

740
01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.696
Premium Assassination Assignment

741
01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.960
Tell me where Chronos is.

742
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.520
Akward!

743
01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.280
Do you think it’s a bug?

744
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.520
I'd rather say it’s an analytics glitch.

745
01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.480
Very well.

746
01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.520
I presume you want to destroy it?

747
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.920
Blast it to hell.

748
01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.120
Ok. well.

749
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.400
The thing is…

750
01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.080
You’re not the first one.

751
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.936
Some guy torched our server last week.

752
01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.440
We can prepare a room for you to blow up.

753
01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.720
Chronos isn’t on an actual server.

754
01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.880
Chronos is everywhere.

755
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.936
First Dark Chronos Assignment
Level 1. Easy target assassination.
Accept? Yes / No?

756
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.560
On telephones. tablets.
laptops. all connected objects…

757
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.936
Warning! Your alert keyword appears on
1 Dark Chronos assassination assignment.

758
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.520
Chronos uses every machine connected
to the network to keep on running.

759
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.640
Chronos has self-modernised.

760
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.600
Chronos is everywhere.

761
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.520
Chronos is indestructible.

762
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.520
Chronos predicts everything.

763
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.600
And Chronos is never wrong.

764
01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.600
Can I have a word at least?

765
01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.680
With whom?

766
01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.600
Chronos…

767
01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.280
You don’t seem to get
artificial intelligence.

768
01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.480
It isn’t a malevolent entity with a
face and a voice. like in the old films.

769
01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.920
It’s a program. an algorithm.

770
01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:30.800
We can ask a question. a query if you wish.

771
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.840
Yeah. please do that.

772
01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.400
Ask your question out loud.

773
01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.440
Boloch created Chronos to help humans.
So why is it killing them?

774
01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.616
That’s easy. I can answer…

775
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.616
Ask it!

776
01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.640
Allright.

777
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.920
Chronos is programmed to generate
constantly increasing revenue.

778
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.800

Chronos Housing Incoming call

780
01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.816
Your presence by the
phone has been detected.

781
01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.120
This is a legally binding
administrative call.

782
01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.320
Answering is mandatory. You are being
automatically transferred to your caller.

783
01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.920
Ms Bolivaro?

784
01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.680
Miss… Yes.

785
01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.720
Your rent is 2 months
late on your MonLoyer app.

786
01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.880
We have sent you 5 notifications.
which you deliberately ignored.

787
01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.760
You knowingly tried to avoid our calls.

788
01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.520
Your phone logs will be used
as evidence in your case file.

789
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:02.920
This call is being recorded and
is legal proof of this notification.

790
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.120
Mummy. who is it?

791
01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.560
It’s just that… Things are a bit tight.

792
01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.456
I won’t be able to pay.

793
01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.016
Madam.
I’m not calling to discuss the matter.

794
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.080
You have 15 days to pay your
debt or vacate the premises.

795
01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.760
Or we will send the district militia
to evict you. forcibly if necessary.

796
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.640
Who was that?

797
01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.440
Nothing. sweetheart.

798
01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.440
Nothing at all.

799
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.560
OK. There’ no easy way to say this:

800
01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.120
your profile’s unsuitable.

801
01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.240
You have too much
experience and not enough.

802
01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.960
How so?

803
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.720
Well.
you clearly trained as a PHP9 developer.

804
01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.200
We need someone who knows ASPX2.

805
01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.696
They’re similar languages.
I could figure it out.

806
01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.697
I’m sorry.

807
01:05:22.721 --> 01:05:25.416
We want an ASPX2 expert.

808
01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.840
I swear I’ll figure out ASPX2.

809
01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:33.040
I learnt all by myself.
So I’m very self-reliant.

810
01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.280
That’s all very well.

811
01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:39.400
But you have no ASPX2 experience.

812
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.600
You’re not listening.

813
01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.760
Dad

814
01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.960
Pick up for fuck’s sake!

815
01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.120
Pick up!

816
01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.600
Pick up!

817
01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.280
Clara!

818
01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.360
You’ve received a photo.

Epilogue
Friday 2:00pm
Place: Melville News Studio

832
01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.760
You know. honey…

833
01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.600
there’s only one way
to make it in this job.

834
01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.856
What do you want to be?

835
01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.240
An actress.

836
01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.200
Actress?

837
01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.440
It’s true you’re… gifted.

838
01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.880
Guess what. I feel charitable today.

839
01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.120
See me in my room after the show.
I’ll give you a nice shot.

840
01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.880
That’s so kind of you. Mr Melville.

841
01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.920
You move and he’s toast.

842
01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.960
Stream me live from your camera. Hurry!

843
01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.656
Do what she says. for fuck’s sake!

844
01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.440
But boss...
- Shut the fuck up. film and stream.

845
01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.680
Is it live?

846
01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.640
Good.

847
01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:57.880
Have you heard of Stephane Maleb.
the Medialeaks reporter?

848
01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.200
No. of course you haven't

849
01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.760
He died last night.

850
01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.600
He died because he wanted
to bring the truth to you.

851
01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.640
He died because of Chronos.

852
01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.360
He died for nothing.

853
01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.040
You know why?

854
01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.160
I died for nothing.
because you don't give a shit.

855
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.520
Charlotte Moon Baï also died for nothing.

856
01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.720
She risked and lost her life.
to inform you.

857
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.920
In the face of injustice.
she refused to remain silent.

858
01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.360
She contacted a journalist.
she put her life in the balance.

859
01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.440
and she lost.

860
01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.760
And you don't give a shit.

861
01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.280
You fool!

862
01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:55.320
Of course. there will be one or two morons
among you to like the article.

863
01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.840
Even share it.

864
01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.480
It can bring you peace of mind.
to feel righteous.

865
01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.920
And then what?

866
01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.600
When you put a blue thumb on a vaguely
shocking video. what do you really pledge for.

867
01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.320
You can share all the
anarchist videos you want.

868
01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:17.240
you're safe.
as long as you buy Chronos products.

869
01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.840
and as long as you
remain docile in your seat.

870
01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:21.960
Nobody watched.

871
01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.920
Whether you like it or not.

872
01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.040
it's a dictatorship.

873
01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.440
And not because of a megalomaniac general.

874
01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.080
a mad billionnaire.

875
01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.240
or some inhuman businessmen corporation.

876
01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.160
No! It's a machine.

877
01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.640
Chronos is a machine.

878
01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.200
and we put it in charge.

879
01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.400
by handing it over our personnal datas.

880
01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:49.120
and by buying all the useless craps
it pours on us every fucking day.

881
01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.600
Blondie

882
01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.240
You never understood what we do. Blondie.

883
01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.280
Our job is to make the world safer.

884
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.800
If that means sacrificing a little liberty.
it works for me.

885
01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:27.560
It works for us all.

886
01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.440
It’s a choice we make as a society.

887
01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.560
That is the meaning of Chronos.

888
01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.400
That is what this world is all about.

889
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.040
What you have done just now

890
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:47.280
is declare war on human society.

891
01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.400
What can we do?

892
01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:57.200
To Die?

893
01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:58.880
Or to shut the fuck up?

894
01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.200
Drop your gun!

895
01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.640
I’m sorry. Blondie.

896
01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.360
Execution order Death sentence

897
01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.840
A job’s a job.

898
01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.360
What are you going to do?

899
01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.960
Nothing I guess!

900
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.520
You're right.

901
01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.360
There is nothing you can do.

902
01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:42.880
It doesn't matter.

903
01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.200
I just had to say it.

904
01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:52.760
Have you heard of Stephane Maleb.
the Medialeaks reporter?

905
01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.840
He died last night!

906
01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.600
He died because of Chronos.

907
01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.240
He died for nothing.

908
01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.560
Have you heard of Stephane Maleb?

909
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.416
Whether you like it or not.
it's a dictatorship.

910
01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.257
He died for nothing.

911
01:22:09.281 --> 01:22:11.896
- Chronos uses every machine connected
to the network to keep on running.

912
01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.920
Chronos is a machine.
- Chronos is everywhere.

913
01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.656
What did Boloch want with you?

914
01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.056
The Chronos server coordinates.

915
01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.496
I’ve spent months trying to destroy it.

916
01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.056
All the servers. access codes.
my passwords…

917
01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.560
I’ve destroyed every known server.

918
01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.320
I gave him everything.

919
01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.257
She's going viral.

920
01:22:28.281 --> 01:22:29.536
Stop this. Shut her down!

921
01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.696
Stop it now! This bitch
won't fuck me again.

922
01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.697
The algorithm is heating up.

923
01:22:32.721 --> 01:22:34.576
Stop the broadcast. Shut the
network down if you have to.

924
01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.496
That would kill Chronos.

925
01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.416
Then run a backup.

926
01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.417
With which server?

927
01:22:37.441 --> 01:22:38.616
I’ve destroyed every known server.

928
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.040
Boloch blasted them all.

929
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.080
Boloch... son of a bitch!

930
01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.600
What can we do?

931
01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.040
What are you going to do?
