00:10:24.903 --> 00:10:26.892
- Yeah. who's this?

187
00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:28.901
- [Joanne] It's Joanne.

188
00:10:28.901 --> 00:10:31.531
- Joanne. what in the world?

189
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:32.468

190
00:10:32.468 --> 00:10:34.477
but it's an emergency.

00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:35.484
I'm puttin' the bacon in the oven.

(phone ringing)

212
00:11:57.663 --> 00:11:58.805
Hello.

213
00:11:58.805 --> 00:11:59.729
- [Cpt. Adcock] Good morning. Copeland.

214
00:11:59.729 --> 00:12:00.681
You up?

215
00:12:00.681 --> 00:12:02.285
- Just finishing up my workout.

216
00:12:02.285 --> 00:12:03.545
- [Cpt. Adcock] Workout?

217
00:12:03.545 --> 00:12:04.378
Why?

218
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:06.994
- I wanna be strong and healthy.

219
00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:09.719
- [Cpt. Adcock] Damn Yankee. I swear.

220
00:12:09.719 --> 00:12:11.111
- What can I do for you captain?

221
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:12.253
- [Cpt. Adcock] On your
way in this morning.

222
00:12:12.253 --> 00:12:13.791
stop in Mira and see if you will locate

223
00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:15.405
a car off the side of the road.

224
00:12:15.405 --> 00:12:17.215
Supposedly it had a couple of flat tires.

225
00:12:17.215 --> 00:12:19.089
Can't tell you much more than that.

226
00:12:19.089 --> 00:12:20.827
(indistinct) call this morning.

227
00:12:20.827 --> 00:12:22.345
Worried about her son-in-law.

228
00:12:22.345 --> 00:12:23.476
Said he didn't come home last night.

229
00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:25.570
- Surely. there's something
more pressing than this

230
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.551
I need to be doing.

231
00:12:26.551 --> 00:12:27.764
- [Cpt. Adcock] There's time for all that.

232
00:12:27.764 --> 00:12:29.247
You gotta drive through there anyway.

233
00:12:29.247 --> 00:12:30.795
Mira is so small. when you blink

234
00:12:30.795 --> 00:12:31.666
when you passing through it

235
00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:33.148
You can dang near miss it.

236
00:12:33.148 --> 00:12:35.398
Just see what you can find.

237
00:12:36.874 --> 00:12:38.134
- Yes. sir.

238
00:12:38.134 --> 00:12:40.345
- [Cpt. Adcock] Thank you. sir.

239
00:12:40.345 --> 00:12:41.345
- Bye.
- Bye.

240
00:13:12.493 --> 00:13:15.160
(phone ringing)

241
00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:22.059
- Hello.

242
00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:23.759
Hey. Joanne.

243
00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:25.292
What's wrong?

244
00:13:25.292 --> 00:13:26.723
- You gotta love small town life.

245
00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.401
- Try not to worry.

246
00:13:28.401 --> 00:13:30.298
I'll ask him right now.

247
00:13:30.298 --> 00:13:32.215
and we'll try to get back with you

248
00:13:32.215 --> 00:13:34.596
with something sometime this morning.

249
00:13:34.596 --> 00:13:35.429
Okay?

250
00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:37.862
All right.

251
00:13:37.862 --> 00:13:39.154
Okay.

252
00:13:39.154 --> 00:13:39.987
Bye.

253
00:13:41.503 --> 00:13:42.967
Hey. babe?

254
00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:44.568
- Hey. Let me guess.

255
00:13:44.568 --> 00:13:47.438
Some guy's mother-in-law's
wanting me to stop in Mira.

256
00:13:47.438 --> 00:13:49.325
See if I can find out where he is.

257
00:13:49.325 --> 00:13:50.856
Is that about the gist of it?

258
00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:53.103
- Are you eavesdropping?

259
00:13:53.103 --> 00:13:55.180
- This looks good.

260
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.654
- You're not getting
out of that this easy.

261
00:13:56.654 --> 00:13:58.494
Were you listening to my call?

262
00:13:58.494 --> 00:14:00.681
- Nah. it's just your friend...

263
00:14:00.681 --> 00:14:02.418
What's her name?
- Joanne.

264
00:14:02.418 --> 00:14:03.776
- Well. Joanne must be calling

265
00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:06.143
every law enforcement person she knows.

266
00:14:06.143 --> 00:14:09.683
trying to get them to look
for her son-in-law in Mira.

267
00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.493
- Well. she just knows
that you're a detective

268
00:14:12.493 --> 00:14:13.717
and we're not far from there.

269
00:14:13.717 --> 00:14:15.965
So she just wanted to see if
maybe you could check it out.

270
00:14:15.965 --> 00:14:18.132
but who else did she call?

271
00:14:19.332 --> 00:14:20.965
- Adcock.

272
00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:21.798
- Jesse?

273
00:14:24.791 --> 00:14:26.658
I don't know. She's just worried.

274
00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:29.036
They haven't heard from him.

275
00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:31.448
- Well. the boss has
already told me to do it.

276
00:14:31.448 --> 00:14:36.088
So I'm headed up there as
soon as I'm finished here.

277
00:14:36.088 --> 00:14:36.952
- What'd he say?

278
00:14:36.952 --> 00:14:40.057
Get your Yankee ass down
there and check it out.

279
00:14:40.057 --> 00:14:42.453
- He drives me crazy with that.

280
00:14:42.453 --> 00:14:45.094
I told him I was born in South Carolina.

281
00:14:45.094 --> 00:14:48.123
Although I grew up for
the most part in Maryland.

282
00:14:48.123 --> 00:14:51.014
Technically I'm from the South.

283
00:14:51.014 --> 00:14:53.316
- Not to folks in these parts.

284
00:14:53.316 --> 00:14:54.930
- Whatever.

285
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.930
(crickets chirping)

286
00:15:39.095 --> 00:15:41.762
(ominous music)

287
00:15:59.102 --> 00:16:00.852
What do we have here?

288
00:17:34.937 --> 00:17:37.280
(soft knocking)

289
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.030
(dramatic music)

290
00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:02.814
(ominous music)

291
00:18:15.614 --> 00:18:18.197
(upbeat music)

292
00:18:30.284 --> 00:18:32.951
(phone ringing)

293
00:18:36.233 --> 00:18:39.816
- He's really starting
to get on my nerves.

294
00:19:12.369 --> 00:19:13.202
Oh no!

295
00:19:18.597 --> 00:19:21.471
You know what. I could use a
break from all this studying.

296
00:19:21.471 --> 00:19:24.291
plus they need me down there

297
00:19:24.291 --> 00:19:26.958
to look after their crazy asses.

298
00:19:32.953 --> 00:19:35.953
(crickets chirping)

299
00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:42.916
(laughing)

300
00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:44.828
- I tell you what. with
all this high water. man.

301
00:19:44.828 --> 00:19:45.693
all I've got to do go

302
00:19:45.693 --> 00:19:48.905
is go out my back door about 50 feet.

303
00:19:48.905 --> 00:19:52.938
You know. cast a line and five
minutes later. I got dinner.

304
00:19:52.938 --> 00:19:55.386
(laughing)

305
00:19:55.386 --> 00:19:57.394
Hey listen. let me hook up with you

306
00:19:57.394 --> 00:19:59.561
in the morning. all right?

307
00:20:00.636 --> 00:20:03.240
All right. I gotta get
some work done around here.

308
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.960
All right. I'll see you.

309
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.877
All right.

310
00:20:08.546 --> 00:20:10.210
Sorry to keep you waiting. my friend.

311
00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.610
Thank you for being patient.

312
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.072
- No problem.

313
00:20:13.072 --> 00:20:14.094
- All right.

314
00:20:14.094 --> 00:20:18.514
Now then. any sign of our guy
on the way in this morning?

315
00:20:18.514 --> 00:20:22.166
- I did find his car. but no sign of him.

316
00:20:22.166 --> 00:20:25.934
I checked the nearest houses
and they seem to be vacant.

317
00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.880
and there were two flat
tires just like you said.

318
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.840
- You know. with every minute that goes by

319
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.116
and that family don't hear from that boy.

320
00:20:34.116 --> 00:20:35.748
that feeling in the pit of their stomach

321
00:20:35.748 --> 00:20:38.722
just gets worse and worse.

322
00:20:38.722 --> 00:20:40.544
- You think there's something to this?

323
00:20:40.544 --> 00:20:43.364
I mean. it hasn't been 24 hours yet.

324
00:20:43.364 --> 00:20:45.680
- Well. now. hold on just a second.

325
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.354
Stop thinking like a
detective for a minute.

326
00:20:48.354 --> 00:20:49.201
All right?

327
00:20:49.201 --> 00:20:51.368
Now. what if it was Karen?

328
00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.025
And what if some police
officer was telling you

329
00:20:55.025 --> 00:20:57.899
that it hadn't even been 24 hours yet?

330
00:20:57.899 --> 00:21:01.054
Now. is that gonna make
you feel any better?

331
00:21:01.054 --> 00:21:02.444
Is it?

332
00:21:02.444 --> 00:21:03.444
Well. is it?

333
00:21:05.709 --> 00:21:07.209
I didn't think so.

334
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:11.557
- Well. what do we know about this kid?

335
00:21:11.557 --> 00:21:13.597
- Well. now. I got to thinking about that.

336
00:21:13.597 --> 00:21:14.957
I remember meeting him a couple of times

337
00:21:14.957 --> 00:21:17.494
when he came to church with Melissa.

338
00:21:17.494 --> 00:21:19.620
Seemed like a really nice young man.

339
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.619
Beautiful family.

340
00:21:21.619 --> 00:21:23.984
- I'll definitely keep
my eyes and ears open.

341
00:21:23.984 --> 00:21:25.974
- Well. it's all I'm asking.

342
00:21:25.974 --> 00:21:28.539
I mean. I know that we don't
have a whole lot of crime

343
00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:32.956
in these parts. but we're
certainly not immune to it.

344
00:21:34.246 --> 00:21:36.812
- Well. it seems there's some
calls that I need to make.

345
00:21:36.812 --> 00:21:38.212
If you would excuse me. sir.

346
00:21:38.212 --> 00:21:39.295
- Absolutely.

347
00:21:40.554 --> 00:21:41.887
Keep me updated.

348
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:43.843
- Yes. sir. I will.

349
00:21:43.843 --> 00:21:44.843
- All right.

350
00:21:49.803 --> 00:21:52.470
(phone ringing)

351
00:22:01.005 --> 00:22:02.841
- [Karen] Hey babe. what's up?

352
00:22:02.841 --> 00:22:05.311
- Hey. I'm just following up with you.

353
00:22:05.311 --> 00:22:08.221
Although I think Adcock
has probably already given

354
00:22:08.221 --> 00:22:09.767
Ms. Joanne a call.

355
00:22:09.767 --> 00:22:10.938
- [Karen] That's fine.

356
00:22:10.938 --> 00:22:12.975
So what'd you find out?

357
00:22:12.975 --> 00:22:14.107
- Nothing new. really?

358
00:22:14.107 --> 00:22:15.690
I did find his car.

359
00:22:17.199 --> 00:22:19.782
(upbeat music)

360
00:22:39.211 --> 00:22:40.044
- Fuck!

361
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.182
Fuck this.

364
00:22:47.977 --> 00:22:49.982

365
00:22:49.982 --> 00:22:51.732
- [Melissa] Yes. who's calling?

366
00:22:51.732 --> 00:22:54.165
- This is Detective Keith Copeland.

367
00:22:54.165 --> 00:22:55.525
- [Melissa] Oh. no.
Don't tell me he's gone.

368
00:22:55.525 --> 00:22:56.858
I can't take it.

369
00:22:58.404 --> 00:22:59.931
- No. ma'am. No. ma'am.

370
00:22:59.931 --> 00:23:03.186
I just called to let you
know I did find his car.

371
00:23:03.186 --> 00:23:05.705
and just to ask you a few questions.

372
00:23:05.705 --> 00:23:08.393
Please calm down. I
didn't mean to upset you.

373
00:23:08.393 --> 00:23:09.834
- [Melissa] Detective.
sir. I'm telling you.

374
00:23:09.834 --> 00:23:10.987
something is wrong with Dan.

375
00:23:10.987 --> 00:23:12.133
He wouldn't do this.

376
00:23:12.133 --> 00:23:13.846
- Just calm down. Melissa.

377
00:23:13.846 --> 00:23:17.097
You're probably getting yourself
all worked up over nothing.

378
00:23:17.097 --> 00:23:18.897
- [Melissa] Something's
wrong. I can feel it.

379
00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.647
(birds chirping)

380
00:23:26.277 --> 00:23:28.141

- No.

The only reason that I'm going

389
00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:43.769
is to make sure that you and Caleb

390
00:23:43.769 --> 00:23:45.948

Great. Electricity is still on.

591
00:32:12.261 --> 00:32:14.344
- [John] Oh wow! Not bad.

592
00:32:21.426 --> 00:32:24.368
- Man. y'all don't even get
the regular channels up here?

593
00:32:24.368 --> 00:32:26.416
- We came to throw a party. not watch TV.

594
00:32:26.416 --> 00:32:27.772
- Speak for yourself.

595
00:32:27.772 --> 00:32:29.752
A movie sounds real good to me.

596
00:32:29.752 --> 00:32:31.824
- Yeah. I'm not in much of
a partying moody either.

597
00:32:31.824 --> 00:32:33.907
- Y'all some squares.

598
00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:37.709
- Wow.
- Spooky looking dude.

599
00:32:37.709 --> 00:32:39.169
- Who's this. Caleb?

600
00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:41.363
- That's my great. great
grandpa on my dad's side.

601
00:32:41.363 --> 00:32:43.929
- (chuckles) There's one
serious looking dude.

602
00:32:43.929 --> 00:32:46.248
- Yeah. well. most slave owners were.

603
00:32:46.248 --> 00:32:47.975
- Slave owners?

604
00:32:47.975 --> 00:32:49.521
How you know he was a slave owner?

605
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:51.053
- James and I grew up together.

606
00:32:51.053 --> 00:32:53.199
K-12. He knows everything about my family.

607
00:32:53.199 --> 00:32:54.407
- Exactly. that's how he knows

608
00:32:54.407 --> 00:32:56.991
my great. great grandparents
were sharecroppers

609
00:32:56.991 --> 00:32:58.723
for his great. great grandparents.

610
00:32:58.723 --> 00:33:00.109
- That's interesting.

611
00:33:00.109 --> 00:33:02.806
- Why am I not surprised?

612
00:33:02.806 --> 00:33:05.805
- Anyway. hey. did your
great. great grandfather

613
00:33:05.805 --> 00:33:07.369
mistreat his slaves?

614
00:33:07.369 --> 00:33:10.125
- Enslavement within
itself is mistreatment.

615
00:33:10.125 --> 00:33:11.952
What kinda asinine question is that?

616
00:33:11.952 --> 00:33:12.972
- Look. chill out.

617
00:33:12.972 --> 00:33:14.400
Look. that's a legitimate question.

618
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.181
If you look at the timeframe it's in.

619
00:33:16.181 --> 00:33:18.860
everybody thinks that all
slave owners mistreated slaves.

620
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.609
but that's not always the case.

621
00:33:20.609 --> 00:33:22.145
- Can we change the subject please?

622
00:33:22.145 --> 00:33:22.993
- Wait. wait.

623
00:33:22.993 --> 00:33:24.525
Let's let the man answer the question.

624
00:33:24.525 --> 00:33:25.799
- It's funny you asked the question.

625
00:33:25.799 --> 00:33:27.481
because from everything
I've always been told.

626
00:33:27.481 --> 00:33:28.828
he did treat his slave slaves good

627
00:33:28.828 --> 00:33:30.229
but he was just a racist.

628
00:33:30.229 --> 00:33:32.486
I mean. he believed black
people could buy their freedom

629
00:33:32.486 --> 00:33:36.145
or whatever. but he didn't
think we should mix the races.

630
00:33:36.145 --> 00:33:38.235
- Well. I guess that racist son of a bitch

631
00:33:38.235 --> 00:33:41.543
is rolling around in
his grave as we speak.

632
00:33:41.543 --> 00:33:43.234
- Well. you joke about that now.

633
00:33:43.234 --> 00:33:46.639
but supposedly. my great uncle.

634
00:33:46.639 --> 00:33:48.980
which was my great.
great grandfather's son.

635
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.357
well. he fell in love with a black woman

636
00:33:50.357 --> 00:33:52.265
and he didn't like that one bit.

637
00:33:52.265 --> 00:33:54.434
- What did he do?

638
00:33:54.434 --> 00:33:57.420
- Well. of course he
said he would disown him

639
00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.558
if he didn't end it.

640
00:33:58.558 --> 00:34:03.021
but uncle called his bluff and
he got engaged to her anyway.

641
00:34:03.021 --> 00:34:04.381
- Well. good for him.

642
00:34:04.381 --> 00:34:07.259
- [Caleb] But a couple of
days before the wedding.

643
00:34:07.259 --> 00:34:08.703
my uncle goes missing.

644
00:34:08.703 --> 00:34:10.065
- What? What happened?

645
00:34:10.065 --> 00:34:11.683
- Well. they found him
a couple of days later.

646
00:34:11.683 --> 00:34:13.196
face down in a creek that used to run

647
00:34:13.196 --> 00:34:15.034
by their property here back then.

648
00:34:15.034 --> 00:34:16.901
He'd been struck in the back of the head.

649
00:34:16.901 --> 00:34:18.447
- Was he dead?
- Yeah.

650
00:34:18.447 --> 00:34:21.328
And he started to
decompose a little bit too.

651
00:34:21.328 --> 00:34:23.989
- Wow. Creepy story. dude.

652
00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:25.296
- Yeah. it's starting to get dark.

653
00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:27.138
We need to like change this subject.

654
00:34:27.138 --> 00:34:30.519
- Yeah. Let's set up the
tables. get everything ready?

655
00:34:30.519 --> 00:34:31.453
- No shit.

656
00:34:31.453 --> 00:34:32.448
Well. people should start showing up here

657
00:34:32.448 --> 00:34:34.031
pretty soon anyway.

658
00:34:37.665 --> 00:34:40.082
- Y'all just gonna sit there?

659
00:34:42.472 --> 00:34:44.003
- I guess I'll help.

660
00:34:44.003 --> 00:34:47.053
I need to do something to
keep my focus off this phone.

661
00:34:47.053 --> 00:34:48.498
- You got boy problems?

662
00:34:48.498 --> 00:34:50.372
- More Like stalker problems.

663
00:34:50.372 --> 00:34:53.900
- Actually. I wanna go check
it out across the street.

664
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.815
before it gets dark.

665
00:34:55.815 --> 00:34:56.663
- Why?

666
00:34:56.663 --> 00:34:57.973
Those woods over there
don't look any different

667
00:34:57.973 --> 00:34:59.676
from the woods right over here.

668
00:34:59.676 --> 00:35:00.887
- You know what? I'll go with you.

669
00:35:00.887 --> 00:35:01.720
Come on.
- Yeah.

670
00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.796
Shelly knows her way around up.

671
00:35:03.796 --> 00:35:05.037
- You coming. Cherika?

672
00:35:05.037 --> 00:35:08.184
- I guess I'll follow y'all up.

673
00:35:08.184 --> 00:35:10.256
- You gonna come out with us.

674
00:35:10.256 --> 00:35:11.897
or you're gonna go with them?

675
00:35:11.897 --> 00:35:14.528
- I'm not exactly crazy
about either option.

676
00:35:14.528 --> 00:35:16.085
but I guess I'll go with them.

677
00:35:16.085 --> 00:35:19.085
- [Caleb] All right. that's my girl.

678
00:35:20.865 --> 00:35:22.003
- Help your friends.

00:35:22.003 --> 00:35:23.184
We'll be back in a second.

680
00:35:23.184 --> 00:35:25.925
- Come on. don't be like that.

681
00:35:25.925 --> 00:35:27.008
Man. shut up.

682
00:35:31.811 --> 00:35:34.443
- So. how long have you known Caleb?

683
00:35:34.443 --> 00:35:35.909
- About eight years now.

684
00:35:35.909 --> 00:35:38.588
Yeah. we met in junior
high. like sixth grade.

685
00:35:38.588 --> 00:35:41.684
- Has he always liked black girls?

686
00:35:41.684 --> 00:35:43.084
- Let's see.

687
00:35:43.084 --> 00:35:46.144
You know what. back then
he had a white girlfriend.

688
00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:49.262
But he was a little bit of a player.

689
00:35:49.262 --> 00:35:51.074
- That was just like
his little crazy behind.

690
00:35:51.074 --> 00:35:54.134
(girls giggling)

691
00:35:54.134 --> 00:35:55.569
- Whose house is this?

692
00:35:55.569 --> 00:35:58.236
- This is Caleb's uncle's house.

693
00:36:08.031 --> 00:36:10.541
- What happened to you. Daniel?

694
00:36:10.541 --> 00:36:12.937
- Hold on for a second.
y'all. This is my mom.

695
00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:15.734
She thinks I'm still at school.

696
00:36:15.734 --> 00:36:17.302
- Well. I might as well
go ahead and call home too

697
00:36:17.302 --> 00:36:19.209
before all this noise and
commotion gets started up

698
00:36:19.209 --> 00:36:20.911
out here in these woods.

699
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:22.214

00:56:37.816 --> 00:56:38.713
- What?

1249
00:56:38.713 --> 00:56:39.721
- [Justin] You heard me.

1250
00:56:39.721 --> 00:56:41.370
You sure you're in Texarkana?

1251
00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:44.170
- Where I am is none of your concern.

1252
00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:47.420
You need to stop obsessing and move on.

1253
00:56:49.116 --> 00:56:50.471
- Damn!

1254
00:56:50.471 --> 00:56:51.839
She must have got that good juug

1255
00:56:51.839 --> 00:56:55.179
if that fool tripping like that.

1256
00:56:55.179 --> 00:56:56.541
(upbeat music)

1257
00:56:56.541 --> 00:56:58.944
- Dude. that car looks familiar.

1258
00:56:58.944 --> 00:57:00.332
- Shit.

1259
00:57:00.332 --> 00:57:02.332

1264
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:15.682
- Tell who where we were at?

1265
00:57:16.771 --> 00:57:18.547
- Look. just be nice.

1266
00:57:18.547 --> 00:57:20.450
After tonight. you won't ever have to see

1267
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:21.283
his crazy ass again.

1268
00:57:21.283 --> 00:57:22.245
- Don't even talk to me.

1269
00:57:22.245 --> 00:57:23.795
All y'all are getting on my damn nerves.

1270
00:57:23.795 --> 00:57:24.628
- Why are you tripping?

1271
00:57:24.628 --> 00:57:25.940
I just asked if you told
the dude where we was at.

1272
00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:26.773
Somebody had to tell him.

1273
00:57:26.773 --> 00:57:27.739
- And that person had to be me?

1274
00:57:27.739 --> 00:57:29.148
- You women change your
mind like the weather.

1275
00:57:29.148 --> 00:57:30.975
- Do not compare me to the
girls that you talk to.

1276
00:57:30.975 --> 00:57:32.012
- Will you guys just shut up?

1277
00:57:32.012 --> 00:57:33.226
You're starting to sound
like a fucking couple.

1278
00:57:33.226 --> 00:57:35.929
All right? Jesus Christ!

1279
00:57:35.929 --> 00:57:39.179
- Man. y'all some cold ass niggas. man.

1280
00:57:40.026 --> 00:57:40.859
Oh. what?

1281
00:57:40.859 --> 00:57:42.223
Now y'all gonna act like you
don't know a nigga or whatever.

1282
00:57:42.223 --> 00:57:43.056
- We ain't acting like shit.

1283
00:57:43.056 --> 00:57:45.773
We don't even run with you like that.

1284
00:57:45.773 --> 00:57:50.479
- Lil' Jay. grew up and
got you some balls. huh?

1285
00:57:50.479 --> 00:57:51.342
Y'all little punks must've forgot

1286
00:57:51.342 --> 00:57:52.686
I used to buy y'all beer and shit.

1287
00:57:52.686 --> 00:57:54.845
- That was like three or
four fucking years ago.

1288
00:57:54.845 --> 00:57:56.224
- And you only did that
shit a couple of times.

1289
00:57:56.224 --> 00:57:57.325
- Y'all don't owe him an explanation.

1290
00:57:57.325 --> 00:57:58.412
- [James] I know.

1291
00:57:58.412 --> 00:58:00.043
- You know what?

1292
00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:00.893
I'm about tired of your fucking mouth?

1293
00:58:00.893 --> 00:58:01.838
- [James] Do something
about it then. nigga.

1294
00:58:01.838 --> 00:58:03.279
- All right. Chill out dog.

1295
00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:05.239
You didn't help me out here. all right?

1296
00:58:05.239 --> 00:58:07.643
Bro. we're trying to throw
a fucking party here. okay?

1297
00:58:07.643 --> 00:58:08.808
- Bro?

1298
00:58:08.808 --> 00:58:09.752
Man. get your little white ass

1299
00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:10.585
out of my motherfucking face.
- All right.

1300
00:58:10.585 --> 00:58:12.121
Nope. We're gonna go.

1301
00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:13.400
- It's cool.

1302
00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.082
Go on with you girl then. man.

1303
00:58:15.082 --> 00:58:16.793
- [Shelly] Shut up. Caleb.

1304
00:58:16.793 --> 00:58:18.190
- Keep your eyes on that motherfucker.

1305
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.859
I don't trust him as far
as I can throw a cow.

1306
00:58:19.859 --> 00:58:20.692
God!

1307
00:58:20.692 --> 00:58:21.561
How did she get involved

1308
00:58:21.561 --> 00:58:24.616
with that nutty motherfucker anyway?

1309
00:58:24.616 --> 00:58:26.570
- Boy. y'all off the chain.

1310
00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:29.336
- I had no idea this many
people were gonna show up.

1311
00:58:29.336 --> 00:58:30.249
♪ And it's running deep ♪

1312
00:58:30.249 --> 00:58:33.019
- Guess Caleb and James got a
little pull down there. huh?

1313
00:58:33.019 --> 00:58:34.729
♪ When I see your heart ♪

1314
00:58:34.729 --> 00:58:36.505
- Yeah. I guess.

1315
00:58:36.505 --> 00:58:39.095
At least they think they do.

1316
00:58:39.095 --> 00:58:42.055
- You know. the only
thing that has me tripping

1317
00:58:42.055 --> 00:58:43.888
is why you lied to me.

1318
00:58:45.224 --> 00:58:48.702
Got another boyfriend here or something?

1319
00:58:48.702 --> 00:58:52.209
- You know. honestly. I don't
even know why I lied to you.

1320
00:58:52.209 --> 00:58:55.008
I mean. it's not like we're a couple.

1321
00:58:55.008 --> 00:58:57.440
We literally went out on like a few dates.

1322
00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:59.647
- Well. can you tell me what went wrong?

1323
00:58:59.647 --> 00:59:02.730
'cause I thought you were havin' fun.

1324
00:59:03.901 --> 00:59:05.246
- [Man] Somebody please help.

1325
00:59:05.246 --> 00:59:06.288
My friend just passed out

1326
00:59:06.288 --> 00:59:07.913
and I don't think he's breathing.

1327
00:59:07.913 --> 00:59:08.746
- Oh God!

1328
00:59:10.047 --> 00:59:11.297
- Hey. hold up.

1329
00:59:13.611 --> 00:59:15.778
- DJ. turn down the music.

1330
00:59:20.013 --> 00:59:21.272
Do you know what you're doing?

1331
00:59:21.272 --> 00:59:24.174
- Yeah. I just passed first aid with an A.

1332
00:59:24.174 --> 00:59:26.174
- Well. is he breathing?

1333
00:59:27.566 --> 00:59:29.341
- He's got an accelerated heart rate.

1334
00:59:29.341 --> 00:59:32.312
How much did he have to drink?

1335
00:59:32.312 --> 00:59:34.968
- I don't know. We kinda started early.

1336
00:59:34.968 --> 00:59:36.385
- Has he vomited?

1337
00:59:38.157 --> 00:59:39.584
- I don't know.

1338
00:59:39.584 --> 00:59:42.251
(ominous music)

1339
00:59:50.508 --> 00:59:51.969
- Okay.

1340
00:59:51.969 --> 00:59:53.407
He has alcohol poisoning

1341
00:59:53.407 --> 00:59:54.913
and we need to get him to a hospital.

1342
00:59:54.913 --> 00:59:56.863
- All right. alcohol poisoning.

1343
00:59:56.863 --> 00:59:57.696
Oh. no.

1344
00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:01.388
Well. no. he can sleep it off.

1345
01:00:01.388 --> 01:00:02.221
Yeah.

1346
01:00:03.629 --> 01:00:04.924
Okay.

1347
01:00:04.924 --> 01:00:07.632
I'm way too fucked up to
do anything right now.

1348
01:00:07.632 --> 01:00:09.987
I keep having visions
of a small Asian lady

1349
01:00:09.987 --> 01:00:10.989
behind the bushes.

1350
01:00:10.989 --> 01:00:13.403
and I think she wants to steal my eyes.

1351
01:00:13.403 --> 01:00:16.820
I think I'm about to pass out too. okay?

1352
01:00:17.886 --> 01:00:20.715
- Okay. So find someone sober.

1353
01:00:20.715 --> 01:00:21.616
- Are you sober?

1354
01:00:21.616 --> 01:00:22.909
- [Shelly] Yes.

1355
01:00:22.909 --> 01:00:24.028
- Okay. then.

1356
01:00:24.028 --> 01:00:26.030
I have news for you. darlin'.

1357
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:28.162
'cause in case you didn't realize.

1358
01:00:28.162 --> 01:00:30.832
we're all pretty much wasted.

1359
01:00:30.832 --> 01:00:32.591
So I'm just gonna have to ask you

1360
01:00:32.591 --> 01:00:34.306
to do it for me. okay?

1361
01:00:34.306 --> 01:00:36.610
- Okay. So we'll call him an ambulance.

1362
01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:37.443
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

1363
01:00:37.443 --> 01:00:38.737
But you can't call 911.

1364
01:00:38.737 --> 01:00:40.785
What do you wanna do? Get us all arrested.

1365
01:00:40.785 --> 01:00:42.945
- What do you want me to
do. Caleb? Let him die?

1366
01:00:42.945 --> 01:00:44.158
- Look. what's your name. man?

1367
01:00:44.158 --> 01:00:45.395
- Doug.
- Like Doug said.

1368
01:00:45.395 --> 01:00:47.395
he's gonna sleep it off.

1369
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:49.762
- You know what?

1370
01:00:49.762 --> 01:00:51.586
You morons can do whatever you want.

1371
01:00:51.586 --> 01:00:52.419

01:09:20.106 --> 01:09:20.939
- Okay. look. party's over.

1597
01:09:20.939 --> 01:09:21.772
We gotta get these people outta here.

1598
01:09:21.772 --> 01:09:23.625
- Dude. what do you mean party's over?

1599
01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:24.840
What?

1600
01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.539
- Excuse me. bro. Can I get in there?

1601
01:09:26.539 --> 01:09:27.818
- Oh yeah.

1602
01:09:27.818 --> 01:09:29.098
Just piss outside.

1603
01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:30.857
All right. tell your people
get the fuck outta here.

1604
01:09:30.857 --> 01:09:32.182
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1605
01:09:32.182 --> 01:09:33.801
- Caleb. shut up. Trust me.

1606
01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:35.705
All right. these people gotta get out.

1607
01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:37.688
- Yeah? What happened
to sleeping in our cars?

1608
01:09:37.688 --> 01:09:38.983
- No. that shit's dead. bro.

1609
01:09:38.983 --> 01:09:40.810
Tell your people to ski-fucking-daddle.

1610
01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:42.121
All right? Go.

1611
01:09:42.121 --> 01:09:44.083
- All right. dude. Chill.

1612
01:09:44.083 --> 01:09:44.916
Later. dude.

1613
01:09:44.916 --> 01:09:46.289
- Dude. you can stay.

1614
01:09:46.289 --> 01:09:47.762
He's probably just fucking wasted. okay?

1615
01:09:47.762 --> 01:09:49.845
- I'm not fucking wasted.

1616
01:09:52.046 --> 01:09:53.983
I'm kinda fucking wasted.

1617
01:09:53.983 --> 01:09:56.399
but we got some big fucking problems. man.

1618
01:09:56.399 --> 01:09:57.965
We gotta get these people outta here.

1619
01:09:57.965 --> 01:10:00.458
- James. you keep telling me
that but you won't tell me why.

1620
01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:02.378
- I'm still trying to
process this shit myself.

1621
01:10:02.378 --> 01:10:03.591
- Process what?

1622
01:10:03.591 --> 01:10:06.591
- Someone's fucking killing people.

1623
01:10:07.434 --> 01:10:09.782
Don't look at me like I'm fucking crazy.

1624
01:10:09.782 --> 01:10:11.415
If you don't believe. just go inside.

1625
01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:12.394
Matter of fact. he's probably out here

1626
01:10:12.394 --> 01:10:13.227
watching us right now.

1627
01:10:13.227 --> 01:10:14.983
- Okay. you're shittin' me. right?

1628
01:10:14.983 --> 01:10:16.601
It's the drugs. it's the
pills. it's the drink.

1629
01:10:16.601 --> 01:10:17.732
They got you tripping balls?

1630
01:10:17.732 --> 01:10:19.525
- I wish it was.

1631
01:10:19.525 --> 01:10:22.858
Like I said. we got fucking issues. bro.

1632
01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:27.661
- Okay. you know what. James?

1633
01:10:29.542 --> 01:10:32.102
I agree with you on one
thing. the party's over.

1634
01:10:32.102 --> 01:10:34.628
but I don't know about these
people driving home tonight.

1635
01:10:34.628 --> 01:10:35.686
- We don't have a fucking choice.

1636
01:10:35.686 --> 01:10:36.519
We gotta get 'em out of here

1637
01:10:36.519 --> 01:10:37.352
before someone else gets fucking killed.

1638
01:10:37.352 --> 01:10:38.757
- Okay.

1639
01:10:38.757 --> 01:10:41.607
Let's just keep our cool about it.

1640
01:10:41.607 --> 01:10:42.440
We don't wanna freak out

1641
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.266
Jennifer's psychopath brother. all right?

1642
01:10:45.266 --> 01:10:46.930
- I'm staying right here. I'm not moving.

1643
01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:47.810
- Okay. great.

1644
01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:49.373
You have to deal with them now.

1645
01:10:49.373 --> 01:10:51.040
- You go I got it.

1646
01:10:53.756 --> 01:10:55.080
- Party's over. okay?

1647
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.215
We're closed for business.

1648
01:10:56.215 --> 01:10:57.957
- As far as I'm concerned.
this party's been over.

1649
01:10:57.957 --> 01:11:00.124
We just need to go inside.

1650
01:11:01.943 --> 01:11:04.772
- I'm sorry. I can't let y'all in.

1651
01:11:04.772 --> 01:11:06.517
- What do you mean you can't let us in?

1652
01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:08.418
Look. it's been a long night. I'm tired.

1653
01:11:08.418 --> 01:11:10.165
I really don't feel like
dealing with your shit.

1654
01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:12.642
Justin just needs to go lay down.

1655
01:11:12.642 --> 01:11:15.139
- Hey. where's your little friend?

1656
01:11:15.139 --> 01:11:16.928
- He just walked off.

1657
01:11:16.928 --> 01:11:18.067
Hey. chill out.

1658
01:11:18.067 --> 01:11:20.381
I can't let nobody in.

1659
01:11:20.381 --> 01:11:23.228
- You are out of your freaking mind.

1660
01:11:23.228 --> 01:11:26.265
You and Caleb need fucking help.

1661
01:11:26.265 --> 01:11:27.708
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1662
01:11:27.708 --> 01:11:28.573
I can't deal with this.

1663
01:11:28.573 --> 01:11:29.490
I'll drive.

1664
01:11:31.246 --> 01:11:32.348
- Be safe.

1665
01:11:32.348 --> 01:11:34.029
- [Shelly] Don't talk to me.

1666
01:11:34.029 --> 01:11:37.911
- [Justin] Told you they
were some little punks.

1667
01:11:37.911 --> 01:11:40.265
- Hey. what's going on here?

1668
01:11:40.265 --> 01:11:41.098
Hey.

1669
01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:43.482
Hey. I asked you a question.

1670
01:11:43.482 --> 01:11:45.001
What the hell going on in there?

1671
01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:46.537
What you hidin'?

1672
01:11:46.537 --> 01:11:48.491
(ominous music)

1673
01:11:48.491 --> 01:11:50.283
That's it. I'm done playin' around. man.

1674
01:11:50.283 --> 01:11:51.116
I'm calling the cops.

1675
01:11:51.116 --> 01:11:53.659
- Look. you don't wanna go in.

1676
01:11:53.659 --> 01:11:54.764
It's a mess. all right?

1677
01:11:54.764 --> 01:11:58.681
Somebody got sick and
they threw up everywhere.

1678
01:12:01.898 --> 01:12:04.842
- I don't believe a word coming
out of your fucking mouth.

1679
01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:05.925
You got that?

1680
01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:09.270
- Look. you sister's not in here.

1681
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:12.547
It's all you care about. right?

1682
01:12:12.547 --> 01:12:14.386
- Is that right?

1683
01:12:14.386 --> 01:12:18.291
If Jennifer is not here in five minutes.

1684
01:12:18.291 --> 01:12:20.898
there's nothing. I repeat. nothing.

1685
01:12:20.898 --> 01:12:23.377
that's gonna stop me
from getting in there.

1686
01:12:23.377 --> 01:12:26.127
I'm a be all up in your ass. boy.

1687
01:12:32.977 --> 01:12:34.190
♪ I've been just wanting
to see your shit ♪

1688
01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:36.632
- Hey. cut it. Cut it. dude.

1689
01:12:36.632 --> 01:12:39.180
Guys. look. we appreciate
you guys coming out tonight

1690
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.562
to party with us and we hope
you had fun. but party's over.

1691
01:12:41.562 --> 01:12:42.621
You guys gotta go home.

1692
01:12:42.621 --> 01:12:43.499
Drive safe.

1693
01:12:43.499 --> 01:12:45.865
Just drive safely and go home. Go home.

1694
01:12:45.865 --> 01:12:47.283
- What's going on?
- Just go home.

1695
01:12:47.283 --> 01:12:48.880
(ominous music)
It's over. okay?

1696
01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.713
I'm sorry.

1697
01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:54.701
Nice. Just nice.

1698
01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:58.105
Fuck. man!

1699
01:12:59.034 --> 01:13:02.034
(crickets chirping)

1700
01:13:06.586 --> 01:13:08.372
- I'm certain we need to
get the hell outta here.

1701
01:13:08.372 --> 01:13:10.122
Let me get your keys.

1702
01:13:11.986 --> 01:13:14.964
Just be still. I'll grab 'em.

1703
01:13:14.964 --> 01:13:18.576
Probably. you got like some broken ribs.

1704
01:13:18.576 --> 01:13:21.409
Just take you to a hospital. okay?

1705
01:13:29.153 --> 01:13:31.189
- Jen. I'm really not in
the mood for this tonight.

1706
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:33.522
I'm about to leave your ass.

1707
01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.246
Time's up. kid.

1708
01:13:39.394 --> 01:13:41.860
- Look. man. You can't go in there.

1709
01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.396
- And who's gonna stop me?

1710
01:13:43.396 --> 01:13:44.313
You. nigga?

1711
01:13:45.218 --> 01:13:46.968
- You're trespassin'.

1712
01:13:47.825 --> 01:13:49.997
- Don't ever put your hands on me again.

1713
01:13:49.997 --> 01:13:51.106
- Dude. what the fuck. dude?

1714
01:13:51.106 --> 01:13:51.939
You can't go-
- Jen.

1715
01:13:51.939 --> 01:13:53.853
- Hey.
- Jennifer.

1716
01:13:53.853 --> 01:13:54.749
Jen. you in here?

1717
01:13:54.749 --> 01:13:56.603
- Hey. I told you she
ain't in here. nigga.

1718
01:13:56.603 --> 01:13:58.491
- Back off me.

1719
01:13:58.491 --> 01:14:00.538
- We told you. you
can't come in here. sir.

1720
01:14:00.538 --> 01:14:01.679
Dude. you gotta get out of here.

1721
01:14:01.679 --> 01:14:03.020
- Get your fucking hands off me.

1722
01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.119
- Dude. this is my fucking property.

1723
01:14:04.119 --> 01:14:05.178
- I don't give a fuck.

1724
01:14:05.178 --> 01:14:06.184
Jen!

1725
01:14:06.184 --> 01:14:08.262
Jen. What the...

1726
01:14:08.262 --> 01:14:09.286
What the fuck?

1727
01:14:09.286 --> 01:14:10.326
What the fuck?

1728
01:14:10.326 --> 01:14:11.702
- What the fuck?
- Jen.

1729
01:14:11.702 --> 01:14:12.726
Jen!

1730
01:14:12.726 --> 01:14:14.997
- Dude. what the fuck is that?

1731
01:14:14.997 --> 01:14:16.837
What the fuck is that?

1732
01:14:16.837 --> 01:14:19.004
- Jen!
- Fucking dead body.

1733
01:14:22.441 --> 01:14:23.736
- Shit!

1734
01:14:23.736 --> 01:14:25.704
- Okay. some party. huh?

1735
01:14:25.704 --> 01:14:27.523
- Yeah. I guess.

1736
01:14:27.523 --> 01:14:29.223
It ended kind of abruptly though.

1737
01:14:29.223 --> 01:14:32.640
However. it all doesn't have to end here.

1738
01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:37.092
- Such a gentleman.

1739
01:14:37.092 --> 01:14:39.092
- As always. sweetheart.

1740
01:14:42.088 --> 01:14:44.722
- Three more fucking dead bodies?

1741
01:14:44.722 --> 01:14:46.222
Are you fucking...

1742
01:14:50.617 --> 01:14:53.284
(ominous music)

1743
01:14:57.909 --> 01:15:00.242
(screaming)

1744
01:15:06.425 --> 01:15:07.258
- What the fuck was that?

1745
01:15:07.258 --> 01:15:09.301
- Our imaginary killer
killing somebody else.

1746
01:15:09.301 --> 01:15:11.718
- What are you talking about?

1747
01:15:13.191 --> 01:15:14.041
- Jason.

1748
01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:14.874
Hey.

1749
01:15:14.874 --> 01:15:15.707
Hey.

1750
01:15:15.707 --> 01:15:17.095
It's okay. it's okay.

1751
01:15:17.095 --> 01:15:18.388
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1752
01:15:18.388 --> 01:15:19.221
Oh my god.

1753
01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:24.755
- It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna...

1754
01:15:24.755 --> 01:15:26.172
- Son of a bitch.

1755
01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:29.952
- We gotta go.

1756
01:15:32.909 --> 01:15:33.791
- We need some weapons.

1757
01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:35.196
Y'all ain't got no straps in here?

1758
01:15:35.196 --> 01:15:37.196
- What the fuck is that?

1759
01:15:40.251 --> 01:15:41.903
What the fuck!

1760
01:15:41.903 --> 01:15:43.134
- I need something
different than this knife.

1761
01:15:43.134 --> 01:15:44.191
We gotta get you close to him.

1762
01:15:44.191 --> 01:15:46.608
- Dude. I don't fucking know.

1763
01:15:48.798 --> 01:15:49.631
Fuck!

1764
01:15:50.722 --> 01:15:52.179
- Look. I need you to
snap the fuck out of it.

1765
01:15:52.179 --> 01:15:55.135
All right. we gotta get out
there and show some bottle.

1766
01:15:55.135 --> 01:15:56.561
Look at me.

1767
01:15:56.561 --> 01:15:57.838
Get your shit together.

1768
01:15:57.838 --> 01:15:59.541
I need you. bro.

1769
01:15:59.541 --> 01:16:01.532
- Fine. Fine.
- Come on.

1770
01:16:01.532 --> 01:16:02.365
- Fine.

1771
01:16:03.439 --> 01:16:05.880
- We're gonna have to either
go to the police station

1772
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.327
or call from the highway.

1773
01:16:07.327 --> 01:16:09.264

1774
01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:10.734

1775
01:16:10.734 --> 01:16:11.567

We could have used your help.

1790
01:17:07.946 --> 01:17:10.665
- I guess his crazy ass was
good for something after all.

1791
01:17:10.665 --> 01:17:12.252

1792

to the cops. man.
