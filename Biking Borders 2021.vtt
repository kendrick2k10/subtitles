00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.640
Our eyelashes. eyebrows froze.

4
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.520
‪headphones broke. cell phone died.

5
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.400
We can't feel our hands anymore.

6
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.040
It's just sick. In moments like these.

7
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.640
you start to question
some of your life choices.

8
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.800
<i>This cold man here is me: Nono.</i>

9
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.240
{\an8}<i>And this is what I look like</i>
<i>without my mask on.</i>

10
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.640
<i>And this hairy creature is me.</i>

11
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.720
<i>‪Max.</i>

12
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.440
<i>We met in college.</i>

13
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.200
<i>are best friends</i>
<i>and have one thing in common:</i>

14
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.040
I hate it. I hate cycling.

15
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.760
I'll never like cycling.

16
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.120
<i>First of all. our trip</i>
<i>really didn't change anything about that.</i>

17
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.320
<i>And yet. these 15.000 kilometers</i>

18
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.960
<i>on two wheels</i>
<i>were the best thing we've ever done.</i>

19
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.360
<i>Because Biking Borders</i>
<i>is more than just a bicycle trip.</i>

20
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.960
<i>During our semester abroad.</i>
<i>we got to teach at schools.</i>

21
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.680
<i>in Guatemala. among other places.</i>

22
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.600
<i>One in five children there</i>
<i>can't attend school.</i>

23
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.560
<i>There is a lack of infrastructure</i>
<i>and financial resources.</i>

24
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.480
<i>Since then. we've had a big dream.</i>

25
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.720
<i>We want to build a school there.</i>

26
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.400
<i>That's why we're launching a fundraiser</i>

27
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.120
<i>together with an NGO</i>
<i>for sustainable education.</i>

28
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.000
{\an8}<i>We'll try to generate attention</i>
<i>through social media.</i>

29
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.120
<i>Nowadays. the best way to do that is</i>
<i>by doing crazy things.</i>

30
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.280
{\an8}<i>Our challenge:</i>

31
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.200
{\an8}<i>a bike trip around the world.</i>

32
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.120
<i>From Berlin to Beijing.</i>

33
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.160
{\an8}<i>Guatemala wasn't an option</i>
<i>because of all the water.</i>

34
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.560
<i>And so Biking Borders is born.</i>

35
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.320
<i>probably</i>
<i>the longest bicycle fundraiser "run" ever</i>

36
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.240
<i>to build a school</i>
<i>on the other side of the world.</i>

37
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.400
Yes. and we'll bike from here to Beijing.

38
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.400
{\an8}<i>Six months of planning are now over.</i>

39
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.040
{\an8}To be honest. I don't even know

40
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.040
{\an8}what we've gotten ourselves into.

41
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.840
{\an8}Man. I've never cycled
more than 50 kilometers.

42
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.480
<i>I've been imagining this day</i>
<i>for six months.</i>

43
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.160
<i>and now it's actually here.</i>

44
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.720
{\an8}There's just all of this excitement.
anticipation. nervousness.

45
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.960
Alright. bro. let's go!

46
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.920
{\an8}‪DAY 1 - 25 KM
‪CLOSE TO BERLIN

47
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.240
{\an8}Headwind and uphill. Nice.

48
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.320
My butt is hurting already.

49
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.160
I have to say.

50
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.920
But I still don't quite realize

51
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.240
that we're actually on our way
to China already.

52
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.840
<i>In the first two days.</i>
<i>we make it to Saxony-Anhalt.</i>

53
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.880
<i>Beijing seems within reach.</i>

54
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.520
We're here in Wittenberg.
where we've reached 100 kilometers.

55
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.960
Wittenberg!

56
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.880
<i>From the beginning. you can also follow</i>
<i>our journey on Instagram.</i>

57
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.000
{\an8}Can I do it in Adidas slippers?

58
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.000
-Can you push me?
-It's getting even steeper!

59
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.080
<i>Filming for the fundraiser</i>
<i>doesn't necessarily make us any faster.</i>

60
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.440
Come on. Nono. The last meters.
It's so hot!

61
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.720
So incredibly hot!

62
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.200
‪DAY 3 - 218 KM
‪SOMEWHERE IN SAXONY

63
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.960
What should I film here?

64
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.760
Well. bro. I'm not a filmmaker either.

65
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.800
but I think

66
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.400
that we must somehow convey
that it's not about cycling. You know?

67
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.480
I think we just have to show

68
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.520
that we're doing this shit here.

69
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.200
camping in the middle of nowhere.
to build this school.

70
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.920
I think we need to show that. you know?

71
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.760
Sure. adventure is one part of it.
but we're doing it for another reason.

72
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.680
Beijing. here we come!

73
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.320
There's something outside the tent.
Definitely a big animal.

74
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.000
And Max was just telling me
that there are wolves here.

75
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.880
I didn't know that before.

76
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.800
And now you can guess
which one of us has the ax.

77
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.640
Yes. not me.

78
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.600
Dude. that's a wolf. isn't it?

79
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.960
I hope not…

80
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.480
What are you looking at?

81
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.840
Dude. if that's a wolf outside
and if it's about to howl. then…

82
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.560
I'll shit my pants.

83
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.840
What do we do. then? Tell me already!

84
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.200
Go outside with the ax.

85
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.120
-You got the pepper spray?
-Yes.

86
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.000
There are the eyes in the back.

87
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.120
Nono. three. two. one…

88
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.320
It's running away.

89
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.440
Okay. we're not joking.

90
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.120
There was a wolf just two meters from us.

91
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.960
My heart is still racing.

92
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.080
Tomorrow we'll sleep at a campsite.

93
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.280
Yeah. man!

94
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.720
That was definitely an exciting night.

95
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.520
Oh dear. Let's see what's in store for us.

96
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.760
{\an8}<i>After five days.</i>
<i>we cross the Czech border.</i>

97
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.280
<i>We bike 60 to 70 kilometers a day</i>
<i>and slowly get used to being outside.</i>

98
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.840
<i>rain or shine.</i>

99
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.040
<i>And yes. we even get used</i>
<i>to cycling a bit.</i>

100
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.280
<i>Sometimes you'll even hear this:</i>

101
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.840
Cycling is nice.

102
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.440
<i>Especially when you have</i>
<i>these little feelings of success.</i>

103
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.159
Okay. Max… 30 meters…

104
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.200
20 meters… 10 meters… 500!

105
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.440
-Awesome!
-Cool!

106
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.520
{\an8}Cool! Nine days on the road.
500 kilometers.

107

{\an8}8.500 euros for the school.

108
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.480
{\an8}-Max. what do you say?
-Awesome!

109
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.200
Simply awesome.

110

112
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.480
<i>…get supporters on board…</i>

113
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.960
<i>Biking Borders</i>

115
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.680

<i>Of course. this triumph</i>

119

-A big one or a small one?
-A big one.

{\an8}Rice with sardines.

127

{\an8}and garlic salt.

136

{\an8}So. how does it taste?

137
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.360
{\an8}It's like honey made by fish.

138
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.360
{\an8}-Just bread and mustard?
-Yes.

139
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.440
{\an8}My grandma showed me this back then.
A family recipe.

140

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.240
Sleeping outside tonight. Are you happy?

146
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.120
Well. yes.

147
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.600
Do we have bug spray?

148
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.160
Oh. that's low.

149
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.560
No! That's disgusting.

150
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.480
-I still have to wash my face.
-Go somewhere else.

151
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.040
How many more nights outside
do you think we'll have

152

153
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.840
That's a silly question. I don't know.

154
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.680
I agree.

It's so cozy. Just look at that view.

160
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.920
Yeah. man.

<i>And then this wildlife.</i>

166
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.600
<i>And those mountains...</i>

<i>Those damned mountains.</i>

168

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.080
<i>At least after 900 kilometers.</i>
<i>the bet is finally over.</i>

‪DAY 20 - 1.000 KM
‪STYRIA. AUSTRIA

173
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.560
{\an8}The first 1.000 are behind us.

174
00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.240
{\an8}I can't believe it.

175
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.480
{\an8}Another 14 times that much

176
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.200
and then we'll be in Beijing.

177
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.040
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

178
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.640
Finally. not so many mountains.

179
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.800
Finally going into the ocean.

180
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.080
I don't believe it!

181
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.280
Ocean!

182
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:46.840
This is the reward
for every fucking mountain

183
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.640
in Austria and Slovenia.
This is the reward for every mountain.

184
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.240
‪DAY 37 - 1.820 KM
‪ISTRIA. CROATIA

185
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.320
We've found a place to sleep.
and I'm starting to realize

186
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.360
that today is October 9th.

187
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.480
It's my birthday tomorrow.

188
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.240
That's kind of weird.

189
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:27.480
Your family. girlfriend and friends
can't share this day with you.

190
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:33.600
In moments like this. you do think.
"Wouldn't it be nice to see them all.

191
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.080
to toast in some way. to hug and…?"

192
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.440
Well. but… I do have Nono here.

193
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.400
Shall we eat now?

194
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.760
Yep!

195
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.360
Morning!

196
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.720
Thanks. brother.

197
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.960
You bearded creature.

198
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.960
And my gift is the view.

199
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.040
Come!

200
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.760
Good morning!

201
00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.560
<i>In Croatia. the journey feels</i>
<i>a little bit like a vacation at the beach.</i>

202
00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:26.960
<i>We only cycle 50 km a day and hardly</i>
<i>ever take off our swimming trunks.</i>

203
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.200
We have found
the coolest camping spot ever.

204
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.240
Unbelievably beautiful!

205
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.640
It's just insane.

206
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.160
<i>So far. we've mostly been lucky</i>
<i>with the weather.</i>

207
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.280
<i>But on the exposed coastal roads.</i>
<i>we contend with gusts of 100 km/h.</i>

208
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.520
We can't move forward at all.

209
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.080
We can't cycle properly either
because we're being pulled right and left.

210
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.080
So now we push our bikes a bit.

211
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.720
<i>We don't get much further that day.</i>

212
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.720
<i>And we already have a feeling that</i>
<i>the fine weather will soon be over.</i>

213
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.040
<i>After 46 days. we leave the EU.</i>

214
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.960
Welcome to the Balkans.

215
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.360
We have now arrived in Bosnia
and have done almost 2.000 kilometers.

216
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.840
So only 13.000 kilometers
to go to Beijing.

217
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.680
<i>The further east we go.</i>
<i>the more lively experiences we get.</i>

218
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.840
<i>Not only the animals. The people also</i>
<i>become more curious and interested.</i>

219
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.240
Hi. I'm Max.

220
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:40.760
How are you?

221
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.720
Hi.

222
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.800
15.000 to China. 15.000 kilometers.

223
00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.720
Would you maybe like some juice?

224
00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.920
Or beer?

225
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.720
We're having <i>cevapcici</i> today!

226
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.520
<i>People invite us.</i>

227
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.320
<i>Share their food</i>

228
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.840
<i>and their lives with us.</i>

229
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.360
Great photo.

230
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.120
<i>Miro teaches us Bosnian dances.</i>

231
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.760
<i>Toma shows us how to milk cows in Albania.</i>

232
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.800
<i>And Ibrahim prepares us for Turkey.</i>

233
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.600
<i>And often we understand each other</i>
<i>completely without words.</i>

234
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.320
We're leaving Albania soon.
We're still in the Balkans.

235
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.240
And we're driving through
a really insane landscape.

236
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:27.560
Mega desolate. but the people are
still super nice.

237
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.400
The people really don't have much here.

238
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.760
yet they share what they have with us

239
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:40.680
and take us into their homes…
That is really an indescribable feeling.

240
00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.120
<i>And the landscape doesn't remain</i>
<i>quite so desolate after all.</i>

241

<i>We've already been through ten countries.</i>

243
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.360
<i>but this is the first time we really pause</i>

244
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.200
<i>and leave the bikes for a few days.</i>

245
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.200
So crazy. There's just nothing here.

246
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.080
Nothing. Absolutely no-man's-land.

247
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.800
But we can ride wherever we want.
That's always nice.

‪SOMEWHERE IN GREECE

249
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.480
{\an8}I don't want to get up.

250
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.200
It's so cold.

251
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.080
I don't want to.

252
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.640
<i>Within a few days. the temperature drops</i>

253
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.800
<i>to freezing at night.</i>

254
00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:51.160
It gets colder and colder. Day by day.

255
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.560
And we just can't be bothered
to sleep in the tent today.

256
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.960
<i>In line with the weather.</i>

257
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.520
<i>Greece also makes</i>
<i>a bit of a dreary impression.</i>

258
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.400
<i>At least we don't always have</i>
<i>to sleep in our tent.</i>

259
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.520
<i>Cycling gets more unpleasant every day.</i>

260
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.160
<i>And our vacation at the beach</i>
<i>takes a new direction.</i>

261
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.880
So?

262
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.000
It tastes bad.
but it makes you warm on the inside.

263
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.520
Do you think it will get much colder?

264
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.640
I think this is just a taste
of what it's really like

265
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.800
when we drive through Turkey in winter.

266
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.600
-I don't want to go outside.
-Neither do I.

267
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:15.320
It's raining. it's windy. it's cold.
and it's so cozy inside.

268
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.280
And it's supposed to rain today
and tomorrow and thunder the day after.

269
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.640
So great cycling conditions.

270
00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.520
Let's hope for a tailwind.

271
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.440
-For what?
-A tailwind.

272
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.600
Yes. because we've had tailwinds so often.

273
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.000
-I don't think there is such a thing.
-I think a tailwind is a lie.

274
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.120
Yes. I agree. Just like climate change.
Doesn't exist either.

275
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.680
It's raining. it's windy.

276
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.200
It's about to get dark. and we still
don't have a place to sleep.

277
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.200
This sucks. It's no fun.

278
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.320
This is one of those moments

279
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.800
when you question it all.
Completely soaked.

280
00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.960
<i>And just when you think</i>
<i>it can't get any worse…</i>

281
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.880
Man…

282
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.440
Three thousand kilometers
and I have my first flat tire.

283
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.640
I've never changed a tire in my life.

284
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.680
Max has to show me that first.

<i>right before we left.</i>

286
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.600
{\an8}<i>we went to the bike shop</i>
<i>and had everything explained to us.</i>

287
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.400
<i>For four hours.</i>

288
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.280
<i>I must have been… a bit inattentive.</i>

289
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.440
I don't believe it.
Who builds such a long fucking valve?

290
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.920
<i>After only one hour. Nono finally did it!</i>

291
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.680
<i>And then the tire lasted… a whole day.</i>

292
00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.240
I'm so fed up with this.

293
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.320
<i>Well. Nono. what are good friends for?</i>

294
00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.240
<i>Well. for a fair division of labor?</i>

295

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:12.240
I've never slept outdoors
when it was this cold. I slept with

336
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.360
the thick gloves on. the hat. the hood.

337
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.640
And still. I woke up at night
because I was cold.

338
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.000
<i>No matter how well you plan.</i>

339
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:38.480
<i>on a bike tour from Germany to China.</i>
<i>you'll end up in winter at some point.</i>

340
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.960
<i>Many ski tourists come</i>
<i>to eastern Turkey in January.</i>

341
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.920
<i>and this year also two cyclists.</i>

342
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:55.200
It's been snowing here all day.
We have 30 centimeters of fresh snow.

343
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.120
The cycling… we slide all the time.
It's so difficult.

344
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.080
Hello!

345
00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.760
But it's exactly because of situations
like these that it's fun.

346
00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.640
-Are you alright?
-Yeah.

347
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.360
I don't think we have winter tires.

348
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.520
Now I have a lot of snow in my shoe.

349
00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.360
I think when people told us
Turkey was impossible in winter.

350
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.000
this is what they meant.

351
00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.400
If it keeps snowing like this.
we'll have to stop.

352
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.600
We must go somewhere.

353
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.560
Yes. that's true.

354
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.920
<i>What worries us a bit:</i>
<i>We are on the road to Eastern Anatolia.</i>

355
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.040
<i>the coldest and highest region of Turkey.</i>

356
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.480
<i>In a few days. we'll be going up</i>
<i>another 1.000 meters.</i>

357
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.880
<i>No idea how we're going to get there</i>
<i>if we can't even make it here.</i>

358
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:31.080
<i>But at the same time. these are exactly</i>
<i>the situations we can use for our project.</i>

359
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.840
<i>Maybe the snow will get us</i>
<i>a bit more attention again.</i>

360
00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.480
<i>Cycling is no longer possible today.</i>
<i>though.</i>

361
00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.240
<i>Cooking. showering and. above all.</i>
<i>sleeping are so unpleasant in this snow</i>

362
00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.080
<i>that we don't want to spend</i>
<i>the night outside.</i>

363
00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.320
<i>We try to improvise.</i>

364
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.640
Sorry. question. do you speak English?

365
00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.400
<i>-Bicicletta. Alemania…</i>
-China.

366
00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.320
China?

367
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.520
Turkey. Iran. Turkmenistan.
Uzbekistan. Kyrgyzstan.

368
00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.880
Thank you!

369
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.440
<i>Really. we had only wanted</i>
<i>to ask about a mosque.</i>

370
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.160
<i>But Kadir invited us without hesitation</i>
<i>to spend the night in his tearoom.</i>

371
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.280
Now we're lying here in the middle
of a bar. on the floor.

372
00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.160
Welcome to hospitality in Turkey.

373
00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.720
Goodbye!

374
00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.200
<i>Kadir forgives</i>
<i>our non-existent knowledge of Turkish</i>

375
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.280
<i>and tells us</i>
<i>that he has lived in Austria before…</i>

376
00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.960
Austria. Lindenhof 154.

377
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.080
<i>…and that his son</i>
<i>passed away a few months ago.</i>

378
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.280
<i>We sense how happy he is about our visit.</i>

379
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.240
<i>We stay in touch with him</i>
<i>even after the trip.</i>

380
00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:02.760
<i>The mountains of Eastern Anatolia</i>
<i>keep what the locals promised us:</i>

381
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.560
<i>They're beautiful.</i>

382
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.880
<i>And fucking cold.</i>

383
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:28.240
I'm wearing two pairs of ski socks
and the thick winter boots.

384
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.840
My feet are just blocks of ice.

385
00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.200
<i>For six weeks. we drive through the snow.</i>

386
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.720
<i>Sometimes we only manage</i>
<i>30 km a day. encounter ice storms</i>

387
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.160
<i>and at times. we forget</i>
<i>why we're even here.</i>

388
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.440
It's really the first time on this trip
that I don't feel like it anymore.

389
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.360
I just want nice weather. summer…

390
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.480
Really. it just pisses me off.

391
00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.600
But we took a break
and looked at our cell phones.

392
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.800
We got many messages from
people who've seen where we're going.

393
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:24.640
{\an8}And that still gives you the motivation
to keep going.

394
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.360
<i>And: We finally make it</i>
<i>into the Turkish newspaper.</i>

395
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.520
{\an8}<i>…and lots of other media</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

396
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:58.200
<i>The winter has driven the fundraiser</i>
<i>so much that the freezing was worth it.</i>

397
00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.720
<i>After four and a half months.</i>
<i>we reach the border to Iran.</i>

398
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.960
‪DAY 141 - 5.290 KM
‪DOGUBEYAZIT. TURKEY

399
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.520
<i>Many friends and relatives were wary</i>
<i>about us crossing through there.</i>

400
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.360
We're excited about the country.
the people. especially the differences.

401
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:51.480
between what you imagine
and what it's like. We're so over winter.

402
00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.720
Iran. here we come!

403
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:06.400
<i>The first days in Iranian traffic</i>
<i>take some getting used to.</i>

404
00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.440
It's just no fun.

405
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.560
<i>So little fun that we even switch</i>
<i>sides sometimes.</i>

406
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.600
<i>It's a shame</i>
<i>when there's no room in the front.</i>

407
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.240
Ouch. that really hurt!

408
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.760
<i>But this is where Iran shows itself</i>
<i>from its most beautiful side.</i>

409
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:12.080
<i>First he takes us 50 km in his truck.</i>
<i>and then Nemat invites us to his house</i>

410
00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.560
<i>for a traditional Persian dinner.</i>

411
00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.760
His name is Ali.

412
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.680
These are Max and Nono.

413
00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.800
-The Iranian team wears white jerseys.
-Iran. white.

414
00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.800
-Who are you supporting? Iran or Japan?
-Iran.

415
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.800
<i>We've experienced a lot of hospitality</i>
<i>on our trip.</i>

416
00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.800
<i>But Iran just takes it</i>
<i>to a whole new level.</i>

417
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.480
Goodbye!

418
00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.880
Hello!

419
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:04.880
Hello!

420
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.600
<i>No matter where we go.</i>
<i>people greet us. stop us.</i>

421
00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.720
<i>share their food with us.</i>

422
00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.440
Thank you.

423
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.280
<i>What seems impossible to us in Germany</i>
<i>is quite normal here:</i>

424
00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.800
<i>Complete strangers invite us</i>
<i>to their homes.</i>

425
00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.120
<i>We hardly sleep in our tents.</i>
<i>We're given a place to sleep most nights.</i>

426
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.520
<i>As Europeans. we are still</i>
<i>a rarity for the people here.</i>

427
00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.400
<i>The interest in us and our view</i>
<i>of the world is huge.</i>

428
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.960
<i>The Iranians are</i>
<i>grateful for the opportunity</i>

429
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.080
<i>to pass on some of their thinking.</i>

430
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.640
<i>their culture and their language to us.</i>

431
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:19.520
<i>On 21 March 2019.</i>
<i>we celebrate the Iranian New Year 1398.</i>

432
00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.200
<i>Sale no mobaarak.</i>

433
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.000
<i>Sale no mobaarak.</i>

434
00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.680
<i>And all the people we meet here</i>
<i>are united by one thing:</i>

435
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.640
<i>They want us to remember them well</i>

436
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.360
<i>and to see Iran</i>
<i>from a different point of view</i>

437
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.720
<i>than what our media shows.</i>

438
00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.760
<i>There's no other way to say it:</i>

439
00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.800
<i>We have fallen in love with Iran.</i>

440
00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.960
<i>We love the culture.</i>

441
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.520
<i>We love the people.</i>

442
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.480
Hello!

443
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.840
<i>We love the food.</i>

444
00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.280
<i>Well… most of it anyway.</i>

445
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.800
Spicy?

446
00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.200
Oh. yes…

447
00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.920
Max. do you want a Magnam?

448
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.400
<i>It's strange that. of all places.</i>
<i>we feel safest here in Iran.</i>

449
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.840
<i>the country</i>

450
00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.680
<i>we had the most reservations about.</i>

451
00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.280
I don't think we've ever had
so much food on us.

452
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.840
We have to turn left.

453
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:21.160
<i>Shortly after Yazd. about 650 kilometers</i>
<i>before Tehran. we enter no-man's-land.</i>

454
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.040
‪DAY 173 - 5.836 KM
‪NODOUSHAN. IRAN

455
00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:39.440
We're completely on our own.
We have to make do with what we've got.

456
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:44.280
But it's awesome.
I think it's so awesome. I feel so free.

457
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.360
Alone. in Iran. 50 km/h!

458
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.480
<i>And just when it couldn't get any better…</i>

459
00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:54.560
We're in the middle of Iran.
exactly five months on the road.

460
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.680
‪I'm looking at my cell phone

461
00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:01.800
and someone really just made
a huge donation and we built the school.

462
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:07.080
We just really did it!
We built the school. after five months!

463
00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.680
I can't believe it.

464
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:35.320
I'm only now realizing
that what we've been cycling for

465
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.360
these past five months.

466
00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:43.640
is really happening -
that this school can be built.

467
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:50.360
And I could just… I don't know… explode.
So much happiness!

468
00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.000
<i>Out of nowhere.</i>
<i>someone donated 12.000 euros.</i>

469
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.200
<i>And suddenly. there it is.</i>

470
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.040
<i>This number.</i>

471
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.480
{\an8}<i>50.000 euros.</i>

472
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.720
{\an8}<i>We've reached our goal.</i>

473
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.480
<i>And then you stop and think.</i>
<i>"Wait a minute.</i>

474
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.440
What is our goal?"

475
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.400
<i>The donations?</i>

476
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.160
<i>The school?</i>

477
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.760
<i>Or our own journey after all?</i>

478
00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.360
<i>We were not prepared for this scenario.</i>

479
00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.920
<i>That we would get so many donations</i>
<i>in such a short time…</i>

480
00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.680
<i>After all. we had said we'd go to Beijing.</i>

481
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:17.440
<i>Should we go on now</i>
<i>to prove something to ourselves?</i>

482
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.400
<i>We are kind of aimless.</i>

483
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:33.400
{\an8}<i>And in the midst of this uncertainty.</i>
<i>Nono and his girlfriend break up.</i>

484
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.600
It's just too much of a distance

485
00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.480
and not seeing each other enough.

486
00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.640
And that's not going to stop.

487
00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.520
Come here. bro.

488
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.360
I can't be bothered.
We still have three months to go.

489
00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.400
I wish it was over.

490
00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:13.840
Such a low point on this journey.
I don't feel like it anymore.

491
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.960
This moment.

492
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.640
when personal relationships suffer
because of what we're doing here.

493
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.600
it takes so much momentum away.

494
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.000
We're still in Tehran. and…

495
00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:39.600
Yesterday I looked up how much it costs
to fly back to Hamburg.

496
00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:07.200
{\an8}<i>And then you see these comments</i>
<i>and news and donations.</i>

497
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.800
{\an8}<i>And there are people behind them.</i>
<i>There are thousands of real people</i>

498
00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.400
{\an8}<i>behind us who believe in</i>
<i>what we are doing.</i>

499
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:23.320
{\an8}<i>We realize that we're part</i>
<i>of something bigger than just a bike trip.</i>

500
00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.840
{\an8}<i>Something that you can't measure</i>
<i>in numbers of followers</i>

501
00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.440
{\an8}<i>or kilometers or donations.</i>

502
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.760
{\an8}<i>We haven't arrived yet.</i>

503
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:41.640
<i>We're not going home. We're going</i>
<i>to the embassy of our next destination:</i>

504
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.200
<i>a closed-off. authoritarian state.</i>

505
00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.240
<i>with the strictest entry regulations</i>
<i>in Central Asia.</i>

506
00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.200
We're writing to the government.

507
00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.120
explaining why we want to come here.

508
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.360
Right. It has to say who we are.

509
00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.920
what we're doing.
why we want to enter the country

510
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.360
and which country
we want to enter afterwards.

511
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.200
We also have to predict exactly

512
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.080
when we want to enter.

513
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.720
and then we're only allowed to enter
on that day.

514
00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.200
That's a bit… Oh well.

515
00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.960
Hello. dear King…

516
00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.240
<i>The next few days in Tehran</i>

517
00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.480
<i>are a visa marathon.</i>

518
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.360
<i>We also have to extend our Iranian visa</i>

519
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.760
<i>and go to the Chinese embassy four times</i>

520
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.440
<i>due to missing documents</i>

521
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.000
<i>to apply for our visa there.</i>

522
00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.200
<i>After four days.</i>
<i>we have everything together.</i>

523
00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.960
<i>But Biking Borders is not only supposed</i>
<i>to be a biking tour.</i>

524
00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:48.280
<i>While the construction work</i>
<i>for the school in Guatemala is starting.</i>

525
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.280
{\an8}<i>we continue the fundraising campaign.</i>

526
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.440
<i>We want to raise more awareness</i>
<i>for the issue of education.</i>

527
00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:01.000
{\an8}<i>And who says we won't get enough donations</i>

528
00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.040
<i>for a second school?</i>

529
00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.240
{\an8}<i>After our crisis of purpose</i>

530
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.680
{\an8}<i>and three weeks of standstill in Tehran.</i>

531
00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.160
<i>it feels good to be heading back</i>
<i>towards Beijing.</i>

532
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.000
<i>On the way to Turkmenistan.</i>
<i>we once again realize how much Iran</i>

533
00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:39.120
<i>with its stunning landscapes</i>
<i>and friendly people has grown on us.</i>

534
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.440
Goodbye.

535
00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.120
Goodbye.

536
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.320
Goodbye.

537
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.080
<i>Ahead lies a country</i>

538
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.840
<i>with only 7.000 tourists a year.</i>

539
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:17.320
<i>We are two of them.</i>

540
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.760
<i>‪and for the first time.</i>
<i>‪we're pressed for time.</i>

541
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.520
This is our last day in Iran.
and tomorrow we have

542
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:28.280
what I think is the biggest challenge
of our whole trip:

543
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.600
a five-day transit visa
through Turkmenistan.

544
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:36.000
And in those five days. we have to cycle
almost 600 kilometers.

545
00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:40.720
I stepped away from Max for a little bit
because I didn't want him

546
00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.760
to hear my doubts

547
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:47.560
about whether or not we can do it

548
00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:51.440
because throughout this trip.
we've only cycled 100 kilometers once.

549
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:54.600
and now we're doing
over 100 kilometers every day.

550
00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.640
<i>Yes. even after half a year on the bike.</i>

551
00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.280
<i>100 kilometers is a lot for us.</i>

552
00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.600
<i>If we overstay our stay in Turkmenistan.</i>

553
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:10.160
<i>we could be fined</i>
<i>up to 1.000 dollars per day</i>

554
00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.440
<i>and. in the worst case. prison.</i>

555
00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:25.280
Our tent is 2 meters
from the border crossing

556
00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:30.120
so we can cycle straight across
once it opens at 6 a.m.

557
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.720
I must say. I am a bit tense.
Well. I know we can do this

558
00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.840
if everything goes smoothly. but…

559
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:45.720
I'm a little bit nervous. I don't think
I'll be able to sleep well tonight.

560
00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.360
Nothing can go wrong.

561
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:04.080
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>if it's a good sign or a bad sign.</i>

562
01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.400
<i>But somehow. we're the only ones</i>
<i>who want to cross the border.</i>

563
01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.920
-It's completely deserted.
-Completely.

564
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.400
<i>We wait for an hour.</i>
<i>Then we're frisked twice.</i>

565
01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.240
<i>We quickly turn the camera off again.</i>

566
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.880
<i>‪Our video equipment seems suspicious</i>
<i>‪to the border guards.</i>

567
01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.120
<i>But in the end. we seem harmless enough.</i>

568
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.880
<i>‪so after three hours.</i>
<i>‪we are allowed to leave Iran</i>

569
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.200
<i>and enter into Turkmenistan.</i>

570
01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.160
{\an8}‪DAY 205 - 7.512 KM
‪TURKMEN BORDER

571
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:54.520
<i>We're not allowed to move around freely.</i>
<i>Our route is predetermined by the state.</i>

572
01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.920
<i>Every 50 kilometers. we have to present</i>
<i>our passports at military checkpoints.</i>

573
01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.120
<i>We better not film there.</i>

574
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.960
<i>There is no free internet access</i>
<i>in the country. But camels everywhere.</i>

575
01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.800
<i>Of course we're too slow.</i>

576
01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:35.240
We've only gone 50 kilometers.
We've got headwind. It'll be dark soon.

577
01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:40.480
We will definitely not make
our daily target. It's already 4 p.m.

578
01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.520
I've got a terrible headache.

579
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.240
We'll try to make up as many kilometers
as we can here

580
01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.360
and ride until dark.

581
01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.320
The end of the first day.

582
01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:09.360
Eighty kilometers completed after all.
and I have a feeling I'm getting sick.

583
01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.680
It can't be. I feel terrible.
Everything hurts.

584
01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.560
Everything.

585
01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:25.840
When I imagine lying at home in front of
the radiator in a bed.

586
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.360
taking medication. drinking tea
and not going 100 kilometers tomorrow…

587
01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.320
I've come down with something.

588
01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.960
Severe stomach pain.
It just doesn't fit into this schedule.

589
01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.240
We had a very restless night last night.

590
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.440
Nono kept waking up. all the time.
He had a fever. probably an upset stomach.

591
01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.440
and he already told me last night that
he'd have to go to the hospital today.

592
01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.320
That's so unlike him.
so he must be feeling really shitty.

593
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.520
<i>But the nearest hospital is in Mary.</i>

594
01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.360
<i>100 kilometers away</i>
<i>and off the approved route.</i>

595
01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.240
<i>But I just can't go any further.</i>

596
01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:56.280
{\an8}<i>For those 100 kilometers. we change cars</i>
<i>four times and it takes us nine hours</i>

597
01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.400
{\an8}<i>until we finally reach the hospital.</i>

598
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.680
<i>The nurse speaks as much English</i>
<i>as we do Turkmen.</i>

599
01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.040
<i>In the next few minutes.</i>
<i>we lose control over the situation.</i>

600
01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.480
<i>Suddenly. three ladies enter</i>
<i>the room and want to help us communicate.</i>

601
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.720
<i>And the man in the blue bathrobe?</i>
<i>No clue what he's doing.</i>

602
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.320
<i>They give me some pills. What are they?</i>
<i>I don't know. Maybe they'll help.</i>

603
01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:46.080
<i>15 minutes later. two gentlemen join us.</i>
<i>Our passports. Government employees.</i>

604
01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.640
<i>Two Europeans in a Turkmen hospital -</i>
<i>off the route - logical…</i>

605
01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:02.200
<i>Nono should go to another hospital. Alone.</i>
<i>And a chaperone drives me to the hotel.</i>

606
01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:10.560
I've been told I can't stay there.
I'm in this flophouse now. and yeah…

607
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.400
I don't know what Nono is doing right now.

608
01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.760
<i>I'm in hospital number two now.</i>

609
01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.800
<i>I don't know why. but here. too.</i>
<i>I'm having a nice chat with the staff.</i>

610
01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.280
<i>The result of the long day:</i>

611
01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:41.080
<i>An injection in the butt.</i>
<i>And because it was so nice. another one.</i>

612
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.800
One. two!

613
01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.080
<i>I let them do anything to me.</i>

614
01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.200
<i>They must know what they're doing.</i>

615
01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.520
Just a fever. stomachache. vomiting.

616
01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:23.160
Oh. man. I don't want to be
in this country anymore.

617
01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:30.240
The nicest people. so helpful. but now
all I associate with it is this infection.

618
01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.040
<i>Somehow. we imagined it to be</i>
<i>a little different in Turkmenistan.</i>

619
01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.520
<i>In any case. no way we can cycle anymore.</i>

620
01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:45.600
<i>Not with two days to spare.</i>
<i>and certainly not with Nono.</i>

621
01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:53.120
<i>Truck driver Oraz takes us</i>
<i>almost 300 kilometers.</i>

622
01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.760
<i>Even if he doesn't manage to sell us</i>
<i>his really foul-smelling energy drink.</i>

623
01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.000
<i>we are grateful to him</i>
<i>for giving us a ride</i>

624
01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:09.800
<i>and for getting to know Turkmen people</i>
<i>outside of a hospital.</i>

625
01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.960
<i>Almost ten hours in the truck.</i>

626
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:26.000
<i>and finally. we reach Turkmenabad</i>
<i>right on the Uzbek border.</i>

627
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.280
<i>At least we make it in time.</i>

628
01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.040
‪DAY 211 - 8.412 KM
‪TASHKENT. UZBEKISTAN

629
01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:46.920
{\an8}<i>In an international clinic in Uzbekistan.</i>
<i>I am diagnosed with severe gastritis.</i>

630
01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:51.360
<i>I get antibiotics. but this time</i>
<i>with an English translator.</i>

631
01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.400
<i>A few days of convalescence</i>
<i>in Tashkent. and I'm fit again.</i>

632
01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:06.360
<i>Finally back on the bike. I'm off</i>
<i>to the last country before China:</i>

633
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.880
<i>‪Kyrgyzstan.</i>

634
01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:25.399
<i>"A Kyrgyz's wings are his horse."</i>
<i>they say here.</i>

635
01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.439
<i>No matter their age. in this country.</i>
<i>anyone can ride a horse.</i>

636
01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:46.120
<i>We'd also like to switch to a horse</i>
<i>every now and then.</i>

637
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.160
<i>But even if we don't look</i>
<i>quite as graceful on our bikes.</i>

638
01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.080
<i>we still feel exhilarated.</i>

639
01:08:58.279 --> 01:09:02.960
It's indescribable how beautiful
it is here. I'm really amazed.

640
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:17.640
<i>We're in nature from morning till night.</i>
<i>avoid big cities or main roads</i>

641
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:21.240
<i>and sometimes feel a bit like</i>
<i>we're in an Indiana Jones movie.</i>

642
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.240
The last meters.

643
01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.560
‪DAY 218 - 8.921 KM
‪ISSYK KUL. KYRGYZSTAN

644
01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.840
It got dark last night. and we showed up
in front of this house and…

645
01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.040
without knowing who we are.
what we do. where we come from.

646
01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.600
they invited us in.
sat us down at the table.

647
01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.280
We were given tea and food.

648
01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:34.320
It is unbelievable how warmhearted
and open the people are.

649
01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.280
I could never imagine doing
something like this in Germany.

650
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.880
But it's moments like this
that really make me

651
01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.840
want to rethink
this attitude I have at home.

652
01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.640
<i>People here really live</i>
<i>in pretty simple conditions.</i>

653
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.600
<i>mostly off agriculture.</i>

654
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.240
<i>and quite often without running water.</i>

655
01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:07.280
The little boy who lives here
has never ridden a bike in his life.

656
01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:11.440
I've just told him he's about to go
for a ride. He's very excited.

657
01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.600
-Da…
-Da?

658
01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.280
<i>I don't think "Da" is his name.</i>

659
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.080
<i>Two months ago.</i>
<i>we were thinking about flying home.</i>

660
01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.920
<i>It's a good thing we didn't.</i>

661
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.400
We're sitting here

662
01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:52.480
‪in Kyrgyzstan in the Steppe in front
‪of a yurt. We rode our bikes here.

663
01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.200
are close to 10.000 kilometers.
we're almost in China.

664
01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.960
It's so crazy what has happened

665
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.600
in the last seven months.

666
01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.560
It feels like we've been on the road
for several years.

667
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.640
and I'm so incredibly grateful

668
01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.440
for what can happen
in such a relatively short time.

669
01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:27.840
That we get to do this here
and experience this here is unbelievable.

670
01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.360
unique. and I will never forget it.

671
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.680
I am so grateful.

672
01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.640
‪DAY 229 - 11.450 KM
‪TRAIN STATION URUMQUI. CHINA

673
01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.160
Absolutely surreal.

674
01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:15.800
It's just another world.
It's so modern unlike the other countries.

675
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.560
Turkmenistan… I can't even put
the differences into words.

676
01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:26.760
<i>Three days ago. we crossed</i>
<i>into China. into the Xinjiang province.</i>

677
01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.160
For the last three days.
I've felt like a constant suspect.

678
01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.520
We were checked six or seven times a day.

679
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.960
We had to empty our bags every time.

680
01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:43.320
We were questioned. had to sign things.
had no idea what was going on and…

681
01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:47.560
It's really so stressful. so exhausting.

682
01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.000
<i>In the autonomous Xinjiang province.</i>
<i>there is total surveillance.</i>

683
01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:56.840
<i>Even in restaurants or supermarkets.</i>
<i>our passports are checked.</i>

684
01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.040
<i>There is virtually no freedom of movement.</i>

685
01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.720
<i>‪We therefore decide</i>
<i>‪to cross the region by train.</i>

686
01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.360
-Are you really drinking that?
-I'm hungry.

687
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.560
<i>It feels weird</i>
<i>being cooped up for 30 hours.</i>

688
01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.960
<i>Who'd have thought we'd be so happy</i>
<i>to be back on the bike?</i>

689
01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:36.920
Now we're off to Beijing.

690
01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:18.960
<i>The wings of a Chinese man</i>
<i>apparently are his electric scooter.</i>

691
01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.280
<i>Merge somehow and go with the flow.</i>

692
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.520
<i>Where one city ends. the next begins.</i>
<i>Goodbye. nature.</i>

693
01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.800
<i>But the streets are full of life -</i>
<i>basically a free cultural program.</i>

694
01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.760
The way he does it is so crazy.

695
01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.120
Can I have a go?

696
01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.240
I don't think you're qualified for this.

697
01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.720
<i>In no other country</i>
<i>have we seen so blatantly</i>

698
01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.920
<i>how tradition meets modernity.</i>

699
01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:27.840
<i>China is somehow. in every respect.</i>
<i>a complete cultural sensory overload.</i>

700
01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.920
<i>After nine months. we got used to spending</i>

701
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.760
<i>every day in the saddle.</i>

702
01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.840
<i>Nevertheless. we are just happy</i>

703
01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.200
<i>when it finally arrives:</i>

704
01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.880
The last day on the bike.

705
01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.600
The last day!

706
01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.680
The last one!

707
01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:55.920
{\an8}‪DAY 246 - 15.239 KM
‪CLOSE TO BEIJING

708
01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.160
Sixty-two to go.

709
01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.920
-Crazy.
-So crazy!

710
01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.560
Exactly 10 kilometers left.

711
01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.080
In your head. you have to go through

712
01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.320
everything that's happened
up to this very moment.

713
01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.040
I've just done that.

714
01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.920
They're all greeting us.

715
01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:46.200
‪TIANANMEN SQUARE. BEIJING

716
01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.640
<i>After 246 days. we arrive in Beijing.</i>

717
01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:15.120
<i>We did not go the whole 15.000 km by bike.</i>

718
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.240
<i>but we don't care.</i>

719
01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:23.400
<i>We were. are and will remain.</i>
<i>two not particularly ambitious cyclists.</i>

720
01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.920
<i>Our bike tour ends in Beijing.</i>

721
01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.160
<i>But as I said.</i>

722
01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.600
<i>‪Beijing was never the destination.</i>

723
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.560
{\an8}‪30 HOURS LATER

724
01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.720
{\an8}<i>While we were still on the bike.</i>

725
01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:00.520
<i>a more important journey began</i>
<i>on the other side of the globe.</i>

726
01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.160
PARAJE XOLJOC SCHOOL

727
01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.120
<i>It is only in Paraje Xoljoc. a village</i>
<i>in Guatemala. that we understand</i>

728
01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.800
<i>what our idea has turned into</i>
<i>in the last nine months.</i>

729
01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:08.240
<i>Let's hear it for the third graders!</i>

730
01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.520
Welcome to the school.

731
01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.320
My name is Vaillan Antonio Ritanopez.

732
01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.440
I'm here to speak for our primary school.

733
01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.400
Thank you. Nono.

734
01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.360
Thank you. Max.

735
01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.360
For our school.

736
01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.120
<i>137 children</i>

737
01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:06.040
<i>can now attend a proper elementary school</i>
<i>thanks to the donation money</i>

738
01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:10.720
<i>and now enjoy the education</i>
<i>that we often take for granted.</i>

739
01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.960
<i>In Guatemala. it is the custom</i>

740
01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:34.040
<i>for the children to hide their dreams</i>
<i>for the future at the construction site.</i>

741
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.800
<i>Their goals are. so to speak.</i>
<i>the foundation for the new school.</i>

742
01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:45.040
<i>The question is. wasn't that</i>
<i>exactly our goal in the end?</i>

743
01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.440
<i>I believe that a goal is never about</i>

744
01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:53.040
<i>something definitive like Beijing</i>
<i>or a fundraising amount.</i>

745
01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:58.120
<i>It's just a step that paves the way</i>
<i>for the next step…</i>

746
01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:02.200
<i>for you or for someone else.</i>

747
01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.360
<i>And the path on which you take those steps</i>

748
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.320
<i>is best walked</i>

749
01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:08.800
<i>together.</i>
