extra in there for you.

You look like you could use it.

43
00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.022
- Thanks. Raz. You
know me so well.

44
00:06:11.022 --> 00:06:13.547
- That I do. which is why I know

45
00:06:13.547 --> 00:06:15.592
you haven't been yourself today.

46
00:06:15.592 --> 00:06:16.985

00:06:25.733 --> 00:06:27.778
Could bend my ear a few?

52

- How could I resist
such an invitation?

53
00:06:31.956 --> 00:06:33.001
- I'm gonna take 15.

54
00:06:36.178 --> 00:06:37.092

55
00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.008
So what's on your mind?

56
00:06:41.183 --> 00:06:42.489
Confess your sins.

[Mara chuckles]

58
00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:45.448
- No sins to confess to.

59
00:06:45.448 --> 00:06:46.580
- [Raziel] That's boring.

60
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.016
- Mm.

61
00:06:48.016 --> 00:06:50.845
I just feel drained lately.

62
00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:53.064
- [Raziel] Are you not sleeping?

63
00:06:53.064 --> 00:06:55.850
- No. that's the problem. I am.

64
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.548
- So nobody's keeping you busy?

65
00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.031
- And why would you wanna
know about that. hmm?

66
00:07:03.031 --> 00:07:04.424
Jealous?
- No.

67
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.339
No. we've known each
other for a while now

68
00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:09.080
and I've never
seen you with a guy

69
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.040
or even heard you bring
one into the cafe.

70
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.825
- Mm. This has nothing
to do with a guy.

71
00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:17.698
Besides. I don't have
time for romance.

72
00:07:17.698 --> 00:07:19.743
- Who said anything
about romance?

73
00:07:19.743 --> 00:07:21.528
Maybe you just need a little...

00:07:21.528 --> 00:07:23.312
[Mara gasps]

75
00:07:23.312 --> 00:07:24.487

[Raziel chuckles]

76
00:07:24.487 --> 00:07:25.706
- Okay. then what is it?

77
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.969
- It's nothing.

78
00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:30.145
It's silly.

79
00:07:31.407 --> 00:07:33.104
- Well. now you have to tell me.

80
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:37.761
- All right.

81
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:43.245
I keep having this dream.
over and over. each night.

82
00:07:43.245 --> 00:07:46.857
- So that's it? Just
dreaming of somebody special?

83
00:07:46.857 --> 00:07:48.163
- Yes. No.

84
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.948
Not exactly.

85
00:07:50.948 --> 00:07:53.690
Somebody or something.

86
00:07:55.823 --> 00:08:00.436
I always wake up when he. or
it. is about to reveal itself.

87
00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:03.874
It's terrifying.

88
00:08:05.267 --> 00:08:07.661
- Sounds something
like sleep paralysis.

89
00:08:09.576 --> 00:08:13.580
- These just feel like
something more than bad dreams.

90
00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:18.280
- How open-minded are you?

91
00:08:19.194 --> 00:08:20.848
- Try me.

92
00:08:20.848 --> 00:08:23.590
- I don't know much about dreams

93
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.548
or even how to begin
interpreting them.

94
00:08:26.593 --> 00:08:29.073
but I do know somebody who does.

95
00:08:29.073 --> 00:08:30.161
Maybe she can help.

96
00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:33.208
Think it might be good
for you two to talk.

97
00:08:34.818 --> 00:08:36.298
- I don't know.
- You're probably thinking

98
00:08:36.298 --> 00:08:39.257
of some crystal-rubbing
new age whackjob.

99
00:08:39.257 --> 00:08:43.044
but I can assure you. while
she's admittedly eccentric.

100
00:08:43.044 --> 00:08:45.655
she's an academic and
she's very professional.

101
00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:48.963
I mean. you haven't
been yourself lately.

102
00:08:48.963 --> 00:08:50.747
And I want the sassy Mara back.

103
00:08:50.747 --> 00:08:52.314
not the spaced out zombie.

104
00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:55.317
- I don't think so.

105
00:08:55.317 --> 00:08:57.449
- Boom. it's settled. I'll
bring you to your house tonight.

106
00:08:57.449 --> 00:08:58.494
- Wait a minute-

107
00:08:58.494 --> 00:09:00.104
- It's gonna be okay.

108
00:09:00.104 --> 00:09:02.672
Trust your old pal
Raz. I've got you.

109
00:09:02.672 --> 00:09:03.673
This is gonna help.

110
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.459
- I guess we're doing it. then.

111
00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:08.286
- Yeah.
- Mm.

112
00:09:08.286 --> 00:09:09.287
- 8:00 PM sharp.

113
00:09:11.028 --> 00:09:14.510
And with that settled. should
probably get back to work.

114
00:09:16.294 --> 00:09:18.949
- You know. all this time
we've known each other.

115
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:20.951
you've never made a pass at me.

116
00:09:20.951 --> 00:09:23.475
I mean. not that I wanna
ruin our friendship.

117
00:09:23.475 --> 00:09:26.348
which it certainly
would. [chuckles]

118
00:09:26.348 --> 00:09:30.134
yet here you are
coming to my rescue.

119
00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:33.877
- I only live to serve.

120
00:09:33.877 --> 00:09:35.052
But you're not for me.

121
00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:38.186

- I'm sorry?

128
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.979
- He sees you.

129
00:10:33.154 --> 00:10:35.025
- Look. I can't help you. sir.

130
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.509
- He commands to
bring her to me.

131

He commands to bring her to me!

132
00:10:44.426 --> 00:10:46.036

I'll call the cops!

133

We're out front.

- Already? I must have
just missed you coming in.

149
00:11:39.307 --> 00:11:40.874
Did you see a homeless
guy out there?

150
00:11:40.874 --> 00:11:43.311
- [Raziel] No. No one
out here. just us.

151
00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:45.487
- Hmm. Weird.

152
00:11:45.487 --> 00:11:47.489
I'll tell you about
it in a second.

153
00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:48.490

- [Raziel] The one and
only. We've arrived.

167
00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:40.934

- Hey.

173
00:13:14.184 --> 00:13:16.534
Is this a bad time?
I did say eight.

174
00:13:16.534 --> 00:13:20.321
- No. you're good.
Ignore me and come on in.

175
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:22.192
- Well. then. Mara.
let me introduce you

176
00:13:22.192 --> 00:13:24.542
to Miss Abagail Firth.

177
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.806
- Is there a problem?

178
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:27.937
- [Mara] No. no. no problem-

179
00:13:27.937 --> 00:13:29.243
- Trepidation perhaps?

180
00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:31.941
- I dozed off. You
two woke me is all.

181
00:13:31.941 --> 00:13:33.900
- Oh. starting without us.

182
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.466
- [Mara] No. I
didn't. I was just-

183
00:13:35.466 --> 00:13:37.294
- I'm just giving you
a hard time. my dear.

184
00:13:37.294 --> 00:13:38.165
[Mara laughs]
It's Mara. is it?

185
00:13:38.948 --> 00:13:39.819
- That's me.

186
00:13:40.689 --> 00:13:41.951
Come on in. Miss Firth.

187
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:44.432
- Oh. please. do
call me Abagail.

188
00:13:44.432 --> 00:13:45.999
- Deal. Well. come on in.

189
00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:47.174
Make yourself at home. Abagail.

190
00:13:47.174 --> 00:13:48.044
- Thank you.

191
00:13:52.527 --> 00:13:54.181
[door thuds]

192
00:13:54.181 --> 00:13:56.792
Raziel. why don't you
make us all some tea?

193
00:13:56.792 --> 00:13:59.534
- Tea? I was hoping for a beer.

194
00:13:59.534 --> 00:14:00.752
- [Mara] Oh. I
bought some earlier.

195
00:14:00.752 --> 00:14:02.363
- Tea will do.

196
00:14:02.363 --> 00:14:04.321
And be a doll. Raziel.
make it how I like it?

197
00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:08.238
[gentle music]

198
00:14:13.809 --> 00:14:16.420
- Here. [chuckles]

199
00:14:20.163 --> 00:14:22.165
[lighter clicks]

200
00:14:22.165 --> 00:14:25.734
You weren't kidding about
her being a little eccentric.

201
00:14:25.734 --> 00:14:28.084
This isn't gonna
cost me much. is it?

202
00:14:28.084 --> 00:14:31.087
- Relax. She's harmless. and no.

203
00:14:32.262 --> 00:14:35.222
[lighter clatters]

204
00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:42.055
[Abagail speaking
in foreign language]

205
00:14:43.926 --> 00:14:45.754
- What is she doing?

206
00:14:45.754 --> 00:14:47.408
- I'm purifying the room.

207
00:14:48.278 --> 00:14:49.149
- Oh.

208
00:14:50.672 --> 00:14:52.195
- I mean. smells nice. though.

209
00:14:53.066 --> 00:14:54.763
- Purify from what?

210
00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:58.158
- Oh. all kinds of nasty things.

211
00:14:58.158 --> 00:15:01.509
Emotions. energies. memories.

212
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:02.423
[Abagail blows]

213
00:15:02.423 --> 00:15:03.293
There you go.

214
00:15:06.731 --> 00:15:11.780
So. my dear Mara. come
tell me about your dreams.

215
00:15:19.483 --> 00:15:22.095
[gentle music]

216
00:15:28.275 --> 00:15:29.145
Thank you.

217
00:15:30.973 --> 00:15:32.627
- Thanks.
- For sure.

218
00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:39.939
- Mm. it's good.

219
00:15:43.551 --> 00:15:48.034
So. Raziel has told me a
little about your troubles.

220
00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:49.818
but I want to hear it from you.

221
00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:52.429
Lay down for me.

222
00:15:56.216 --> 00:15:57.782
[mug clatters]

223
00:15:57.782 --> 00:15:59.480
[Mara sighs]

224
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.611
There you go.

225
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:05.573
- This feels silly.

226
00:16:05.573 --> 00:16:07.488
- I know it does.

227
00:16:07.488 --> 00:16:08.706
Bit like you're gonna have
your head shrunk. right?

228
00:16:08.706 --> 00:16:10.534
- Exactly.
[Abagail laughs]

229
00:16:10.534 --> 00:16:12.493
- Well. we won't be doing
any of that tonight.

230
00:16:12.493 --> 00:16:15.887
I just find lying in
repose just relaxes one.

231
00:16:15.887 --> 00:16:19.413
just opens one up more than
sitting all crunched up

232
00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:21.763
and restricted in a chair.

233
00:16:21.763 --> 00:16:23.243
You do feel relaxed?

234
00:16:23.243 --> 00:16:24.766
- Very.

235
00:16:24.766 --> 00:16:26.246
- Then let's begin.

236
00:16:28.117 --> 00:16:29.945
- They started a while ago.

237
00:16:32.556 --> 00:16:35.995
I feel myself drifting
into the darkness.

238
00:16:37.648 --> 00:16:42.131
into a void. to a dark place.

239
00:16:43.176 --> 00:16:47.006
Someone's there. watching me.

240
00:16:49.965 --> 00:16:51.488
I only catch glimpses of him.

241
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.884
but I'm engulfed
by his darkness.

242
00:16:58.756 --> 00:17:03.065
Can feel him all
around me. on me.

243
00:17:04.632 --> 00:17:05.763
- In you?

244
00:17:05.763 --> 00:17:06.677
- Abagail.

245
00:17:09.158 --> 00:17:11.334
- No. not in me.

246
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.688
It's terrifying and
I can't get away.

247
00:17:19.473 --> 00:17:22.519
I can feel his hot breath on me.

248
00:17:24.217 --> 00:17:25.087
And...

249
00:17:27.437 --> 00:17:29.961
- And what happens next. Mara?

250
00:17:33.269 --> 00:17:34.140
- And then-

251
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.228
[demon growls]

252
00:17:35.228 --> 00:17:37.708
[Mara gasps]

253
00:17:38.927 --> 00:17:40.015
- [Raziel] You okay?

254
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:45.934
- Yeah. [clears throat]

255
00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:48.067
It ends about the
same each night.

256
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:51.026
but a little bit more intense.

257
00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:54.290
[Mara sighs]

258
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:58.251
- And when you wake. do you
have feelings of lethargy?

259
00:17:59.687 --> 00:18:01.993
- I'm completely
drained. all day.

260
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.477
It's like the dream
is sucking my energy.

261
00:18:07.477 --> 00:18:08.348
- In fact. it is.

262
00:18:10.393 --> 00:18:12.308
- What do you mean?

263
00:18:12.308 --> 00:18:15.964
- Well. when you're dreaming.
like truly. deeply dreaming.

264
00:18:15.964 --> 00:18:19.533
the dream state is just as
real as our waking reality.

265
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.277
If you have an
exhausting. active dream.

266
00:18:24.277 --> 00:18:26.192
we often wake up exhausted.

267
00:18:27.236 --> 00:18:28.759
The mind doesn't disconnect

268
00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:31.719
between the dream state
and our waking life.

269
00:18:33.155 --> 00:18:36.027
because the dream state is

270
00:18:36.027 --> 00:18:37.855
just as real as the
rest of our day.

271
00:18:39.335 --> 00:18:41.120
- Reminds me of that
old playground talk.

272
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.296
when you die in your sleep.
you die in real life.

273
00:18:43.296 --> 00:18:45.211
- It's not always a wives' tale.

274
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:51.260
Again. the the two
worlds don't disconnect.

275
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.437
The dream is so
real that the body

276
00:18:54.437 --> 00:18:56.874
doesn't realize that it's-

277
00:18:56.874 --> 00:18:58.224
- Just a dream.

278
00:18:59.703 --> 00:19:03.359
- And that. my dear. you
are correct. [chuckles]

279
00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:06.449
- So you know what
my dreams mean. then?

280
00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:09.452
- I believe I know
what you must do.

281
00:19:10.845 --> 00:19:12.063
- Which is?

282
00:19:12.063 --> 00:19:13.500
- See it through to the end.

283
00:19:14.544 --> 00:19:16.720
- I don't think I can do that.

284
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.852
- Oh. but you must.

285
00:19:19.114 --> 00:19:20.681
The only way you will stop

286
00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:22.944
these dreams is
to see it through.

287
00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:25.164
- I don't know.

288
00:19:27.253 --> 00:19:30.081
- Look. I'm gonna be here

289
00:19:30.081 --> 00:19:32.823
to guide you through.
along with Raziel.

290
00:19:33.737 --> 00:19:35.086
Raziel. you game?

291
00:19:36.087 --> 00:19:37.045
- You'll be okay.

292
00:19:40.004 --> 00:19:41.876
- She'll be perfectly fine.

293
00:19:43.617 --> 00:19:47.142
- So you're talking about
me falling asleep now?

294
00:19:47.142 --> 00:19:50.537
I wasn't expecting
to do this tonight.

295
00:19:50.537 --> 00:19:52.452
This is just all a bit too much.

296
00:19:52.452 --> 00:19:55.063
- We'll be here to guide
you every step of the way.

297
00:19:56.847 --> 00:19:59.937
- I feel like I don't have
a choice in the matter.

298
00:19:59.937 --> 00:20:02.418
- Nonsense. [laughs]

299
00:20:04.855 --> 00:20:06.988
- I'm game. [chuckles]

300
00:20:06.988 --> 00:20:08.207
- Good girl.
[Mara chuckles]

301
00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.078
- Up you get.

302
00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:12.689
Raziel. be a dear and
brew some more tea for us.

303
00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:17.607
Now. go get ready for bed.
just as you always do.

304
00:20:17.607 --> 00:20:19.479
You must have the same routine

305
00:20:19.479 --> 00:20:21.829
to not disturb what
we're doing here.

306
00:20:21.829 --> 00:20:22.743
Off you go.

307
00:20:32.187 --> 00:20:33.101
- [Mara] Ready.

308
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.763
[Mara sighs]
[Abagail clears throat]

309
00:20:42.763 --> 00:20:45.244
- Think you should wait outside.

310
00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.332
- [Raziel] Of course.

311
00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:52.816
- So. my dear. make
yourself comfortable.

312
00:20:57.995 --> 00:21:01.390
- You've done this sort
of thing before. I trust?

313
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:02.348
- Countless.

314
00:21:04.915 --> 00:21:06.439
Just relax.

315
00:21:09.442 --> 00:21:14.447
Close your eyes and focus
only on my voice. my words.

316
00:21:15.926 --> 00:21:18.538
Let me guide you
into the dream state.

317
00:21:20.235 --> 00:21:24.239
Listen to my voice. my words.

318
00:21:24.239 --> 00:21:26.981
Don't fight it. Just relax.

319
00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:33.379
Listen to my voice. my words.

320
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.078
Listen to my voice. my words.

321
00:21:38.253 --> 00:21:42.170
Listen to my voice. my words.

322
00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:47.001
Listen to my voice. my words.

323
00:21:47.001 --> 00:21:49.438
Listen to my voice. my words.

328

- She's away.

Do not fear me.

I only wish to talk.

351

- I have to get back.

352

- But you've only just arrived.

353

Stay.

- It's beautiful.

- Tailored for you
and your beauty.

362
00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:13.588
Mara.

363
00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:19.420
Sit. relax. get comfortable.

364
00:27:22.902 --> 00:27:24.686
You must be hungry.

365
00:27:27.297 --> 00:27:30.866
Your journey must have
worked up quite the appetite.

366
00:27:30.866 --> 00:27:32.868
Whatever you desire is yours.

367
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:36.045
- No thank you.

368
00:27:36.045 --> 00:27:39.179
- Is this sustenance
not to your liking?

369
00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:41.485
- It's all so lovely to see.

370
00:27:41.485 --> 00:27:43.139
- But not to eat.

371
00:27:43.139 --> 00:27:45.925
[teeth snapping]

372
00:27:47.056 --> 00:27:49.102
Libations. perhaps?

373
00:27:49.102 --> 00:27:51.104
[wine pouring]

374
00:27:51.104 --> 00:27:51.974
Thirsty?

375
00:27:58.677 --> 00:27:59.808
Something else?

376
00:28:01.505 --> 00:28:04.160
Anything to make your
time here enjoyable.

377
00:28:07.294 --> 00:28:09.209
Most enjoyable.

378
00:28:09.209 --> 00:28:10.166
- I'm good.

379
00:28:13.082 --> 00:28:14.605
- Suit yourself.

380
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.218
I've been waiting for you.

381
00:28:18.218 --> 00:28:20.655
Lifetimes. it would seem.

382
00:28:20.655 --> 00:28:24.093
- I've been drawn to
here by someone. You.

383
00:28:26.052 --> 00:28:29.098
- And finally. you
heeded my call.

384
00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:35.626
- I had to. even though I
don't understand any of this.

385
00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:40.153
I can't seem to think
of anything else.

386
00:28:41.502 --> 00:28:46.028
I'm frightened yet
compelled to know more.

387
00:28:47.464 --> 00:28:49.336
- There's nothing to
be frightened of here.

388
00:28:49.336 --> 00:28:52.556
Savor all I have to offer.

389
00:28:53.644 --> 00:28:56.996
[gentle music]

390
00:28:56.996 --> 00:28:58.562
- I think she's waking up.

391
00:28:58.562 --> 00:28:59.476
- It's too soon!

392
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.046
- There is no haste.

393
00:29:05.134 --> 00:29:07.746
Time stands still here.

394
00:29:09.791 --> 00:29:11.706
Soon. we'll be as one.

395
00:29:13.273 --> 00:29:14.143
- As one?

396
00:29:15.536 --> 00:29:16.537
- When we feast.

397
00:29:17.668 --> 00:29:21.847
[demon snarls]
[Mara screams]

398
00:29:21.847 --> 00:29:24.501
[gentle music]

399
00:29:27.113 --> 00:29:28.984
- There. there. my dear.
We're here for you.

400
00:29:28.984 --> 00:29:30.725
- Are you okay?

401
00:29:30.725 --> 00:29:33.293
[Mara sighs]

402
00:29:33.293 --> 00:29:34.163
- I'm okay.

403
00:29:35.643 --> 00:29:38.037
I'm not sure what
happened. though.

404
00:29:38.037 --> 00:29:40.039
- You were in a
deep dream state.

405
00:29:40.039 --> 00:29:42.128
- Huh?
- Tell me. what did you see?

406
00:29:42.128 --> 00:29:45.218
- I went further
than ever before.

407
00:29:47.133 --> 00:29:48.134
I saw someone.

408
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.354
He was waiting for me.

409
00:29:52.442 --> 00:29:53.530
- This is a big step.

410
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.751
And we'll go even
further next time.

411
00:29:57.665 --> 00:29:59.580
- Next time?

412
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.582
- You take some rest. We'll
continue this tomorrow night.

413
00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:05.760
- I can stay the night
if you need anything.

414
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.631
- I'll be fine.

415
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:09.503
- I think it's best we just
leave her alone to rest.

416
00:30:11.113 --> 00:30:12.854
Come on. Raziel. Take me home.

417
00:30:16.945 --> 00:30:20.079
- Thank you for helping me.

418
00:30:20.079 --> 00:30:23.822
- No thanks necessary.
my dear. It's what I do.

419
00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:26.999
Now you rest. We'll
see ourselves out.

420
00:30:37.966 --> 00:30:40.099
[Mara sighs]

421
00:30:40.099 --> 00:30:42.666
[door clacks]

422
00:30:45.278 --> 00:30:47.758
[door thuds]

423
00:30:49.717 --> 00:30:51.023
- He likes her.

424
00:30:53.155 --> 00:30:54.113
He wants her.

425
00:30:54.113 --> 00:30:54.983
- Ooh.

426
00:30:56.942 --> 00:30:57.856
Good.

427
00:31:03.383 --> 00:31:05.254
[door thuds]

428
00:31:05.254 --> 00:31:07.866
[door rumbles]

429
00:31:12.696 --> 00:31:14.568
[birds chirping]

430
00:31:14.568 --> 00:31:17.179
[gentle music]

431
00:31:19.312 --> 00:31:22.097
[coffee pouring]

432
00:31:23.838 --> 00:31:26.536
- Last night was awesome.

433
00:31:27.581 --> 00:31:29.844
- It was anything but.

434
00:31:29.844 --> 00:31:32.499
Why can't I have dreams
like normal people?

435
00:31:32.499 --> 00:31:35.328
I mean. I could handle
being naked in a crowd.

436
00:31:35.328 --> 00:31:38.505
- Abagail said you
made great strides.

437
00:31:38.505 --> 00:31:40.463
- Yeah. I went further.

438
00:31:40.463 --> 00:31:45.120
but it's even more confusing
and terrifying than before.

439
00:31:46.469 --> 00:31:48.384
- Then it's working.

440
00:31:48.384 --> 00:31:51.344
You need to see it all the
way through to the very end.

441
00:31:51.344 --> 00:31:54.564
- You wouldn't be saying that
if you were experiencing-

442
00:31:54.564 --> 00:31:57.089
- Look. I understand.
but if you're-

443
00:31:57.089 --> 00:31:59.787
- You're starting
to sound like her.

444
00:31:59.787 --> 00:32:00.875
How do you know her?

445
00:32:02.485 --> 00:32:03.486
- Who? Abagail?

446
00:32:03.486 --> 00:32:04.400
- Yeah.

447
00:32:05.749 --> 00:32:07.447
- I've known her
for a long time.

448
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:11.886
From the cafe. Like how we met.

449
00:32:11.886 --> 00:32:14.802
- Right. and that
qualifies her to...

450
00:32:14.802 --> 00:32:19.372
- Listen. I think
she's an amazing woman.

451
00:32:21.287 --> 00:32:23.680
She helped me through
my nightmares. Now
she's helping you.

452
00:32:25.508 --> 00:32:27.249
As a favor to me.

453
00:32:28.598 --> 00:32:29.817
[Mara sighs]

454
00:32:29.817 --> 00:32:31.775
- Right. I didn't mean to-

455
00:32:31.775 --> 00:32:32.689
- I know.

456
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:39.827
- There's something
else I didn't tell you.

457
00:32:39.827 --> 00:32:40.784
- From last night?

458
00:32:42.743 --> 00:32:45.964
- You. you changed.

459
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:48.314
So did Abagail.

460
00:32:50.011 --> 00:32:53.841
You had these awful
faces looking down at me.

461
00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:55.625
- I mean. yeah. you
could do so much better.

462
00:32:55.625 --> 00:32:56.975
but you could also
do so much worse.

463
00:32:56.975 --> 00:32:59.281
- No. I'm serious.

464
00:32:59.281 --> 00:33:02.328
- You sure your dream
just wasn't incorporating

465
00:33:02.328 --> 00:33:04.069
the events and
people of your day?

466
00:33:05.592 --> 00:33:07.855
- I suppose you could be right.

467
00:33:07.855 --> 00:33:09.639
- Of course I'm right.

468
00:33:09.639 --> 00:33:11.598
And Abagail would
say the same thing.

469
00:33:11.598 --> 00:33:13.513
- I'm sure she would.

470
00:33:13.513 --> 00:33:15.819
- [Coworker] Hey. Raz!
Come help in the back!

471
00:33:17.604 --> 00:33:19.388
- Gotta get going.
See you tonight?

472
00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.347
- Eight sharp.

473
00:33:24.263 --> 00:33:26.917
[gentle music]

474
00:33:43.586 --> 00:33:45.153
- You think she'll
break through tonight?

475
00:33:45.153 --> 00:33:46.154
- She has to.

476
00:33:48.678 --> 00:33:50.419
- Are we starting now?

477
00:33:50.419 --> 00:33:52.204
- [Abagail] Of course. my dear.

478
00:33:52.204 --> 00:33:53.466
- I'll be outside.

479
00:33:53.466 --> 00:33:54.336
- Stay.

480
00:33:55.555 --> 00:33:56.469
- If she wishes.

481
00:33:57.731 --> 00:33:59.385
Okay. my dear. lay down.

482
00:34:00.647 --> 00:34:03.258
[Mara sighing]

483
00:34:04.651 --> 00:34:06.305
Just relax.

484
00:34:06.305 --> 00:34:08.350
[Mara sighs]

485
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:11.527
[gentle music]

486
00:34:11.527 --> 00:34:16.445
And just focus only
on my voice. my words.

487
00:34:17.881 --> 00:34:19.361
Close your eyes.

488
00:34:20.754 --> 00:34:22.886
Let me guide you into
your dream state.

489
00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:26.890
Listen only to my
voice. my words.

490
00:34:28.892 --> 00:34:32.853
Listen only to my
voice. my words.

491
00:34:34.289 --> 00:34:38.467
[Abagail speaking
in foreign language]

492
00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:53.743
- Don't worry. you won't have

493
00:34:53.743 --> 00:34:55.832
to do this again after tonight.

494
00:34:55.832 --> 00:34:57.225
- [Abagail] What are
you saying to her?

495
00:34:57.225 --> 00:34:58.879
- Nothing.
- Well. just careful

496
00:34:58.879 --> 00:35:00.968
not to poison her dream.

497
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:07.017
[Abagail speaking
in foreign language]

498
00:35:07.017 --> 00:35:10.847
[Abagail shouting
in foreign language]

499
00:35:10.847 --> 00:35:12.893
She is yours. my master!

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:19.117
[Abagail laughs]

[Raziel groaning]

505
00:35:49.886 --> 00:35:51.149
- She's there.

[Abagail exhales]

[electricity buzzing]

508
00:36:09.471 --> 00:36:12.039
- You came back.

509
00:36:12.039 --> 00:36:12.953
- I had to.

510
00:36:14.389 --> 00:36:16.043
- So you understand
you had no choice.

511
00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.264
- [Mara] Didn't I?

512
00:36:19.264 --> 00:36:23.050
- It's your fate. Unavoidable.

513
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.880
- So there's no
turning back now?

514
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.186
- Useless.

515
00:36:29.665 --> 00:36:31.319
- Then let's enjoy
our time together.

516
00:36:33.365 --> 00:36:34.279
- Sit.

517
00:36:40.633 --> 00:36:44.027
- There's something
different about you.

518
00:36:45.464 --> 00:36:46.943
- Is something not
to your liking?

519
00:36:48.597 --> 00:36:52.035
- There's a sense of
urgency in your voice

520
00:36:52.035 --> 00:36:54.603
that I don't
remember from before.

521
00:36:56.431 --> 00:36:57.432
- Urgency?

522
00:36:58.912 --> 00:37:01.567
Perhaps I feel our time
together is culminating.

523
00:37:03.046 --> 00:37:05.397
- I thought time
here stood still?

524
00:37:05.397 --> 00:37:08.226
- Or my patience grows
thin from your insolence!

525
00:37:11.446 --> 00:37:12.969
- Is he feasting now?

526
00:37:12.969 --> 00:37:15.102
- No. no. Something's wrong.

527
00:37:15.102 --> 00:37:16.799
She's fighting him.

528
00:37:18.279 --> 00:37:20.020
- Do we kill her now?
- Oh. no. no. no. no.

529
00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.850
The master is merely anxious.
Let him enjoy himself.

530
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.809
[Abagail laughing]

531
00:37:30.204 --> 00:37:32.337
- My apologies
for upsetting you.

532
00:37:33.816 --> 00:37:35.514
I only thought we had
nothing but time here.

533
00:37:36.558 --> 00:37:38.647
- It's I who should apologize.

534
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.870
My anticipation
for what is to come

535
00:37:44.914 --> 00:37:46.525
has tempered of the night.

536
00:37:46.525 --> 00:37:48.309
- And what is to come?

537
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:55.055
- A union. one that will
answer your questions

538
00:37:56.099 --> 00:37:58.885
and satiate my longing appetite.

539
00:37:58.885 --> 00:38:00.974
- [Mara] So that's
what this is about?

540
00:38:00.974 --> 00:38:02.628
- About?

541
00:38:02.628 --> 00:38:06.588
- Our union. You seek a
bride. a suitable mate.

542
00:38:08.024 --> 00:38:10.984
- My dear girl. I
do not seek a mate.

543
00:38:12.202 --> 00:38:13.073
- Well. what do you seek?

544
00:38:18.034 --> 00:38:19.340
- Consumption!

545
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:23.997
[Mara screams]
[demon growls]

546
00:38:25.825 --> 00:38:28.349
[eerie music]

547
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:49.762
- It should be time.

548
00:38:49.762 --> 00:38:54.114
You know what needs to be
done. Go and fetch the blade.

549
00:38:54.114 --> 00:38:56.725
- Wait. what needs to be done?

550
00:38:56.725 --> 00:38:58.771
[body thuds]
- Whoa.

551
00:38:58.771 --> 00:39:01.077
There. there.
- Wait. what needs to be done?

552
00:39:01.077 --> 00:39:02.905
What's going on?
- Shh. shh. it's okay.

553
00:39:02.905 --> 00:39:04.472
It's over now.

554
00:39:04.472 --> 00:39:06.082
- Oh. I can assure you
it's far from over.

555
00:39:06.082 --> 00:39:07.649
You should be in bed. my dear.

556
00:39:07.649 --> 00:39:09.564
You're not seeing this
through to the end.

557
00:39:09.564 --> 00:39:12.262
- Wait. no. get off of me!
- You're wasting his time!

558
00:39:12.262 --> 00:39:13.786
- Whose time am I wasting?

559
00:39:13.786 --> 00:39:16.092
- Raziel. take her
back to the bed.

560
00:39:16.092 --> 00:39:17.964
- No. what is going on?

561
00:39:17.964 --> 00:39:19.792
- It's fine. Mara. you need
to get back to the bed.

562
00:39:19.792 --> 00:39:22.185
- Yes. listen to
Raziel. my dear.

563
00:39:22.185 --> 00:39:24.231
You must continue your dream.

564
00:39:24.231 --> 00:39:26.059
- You seem to be
far more invested

565
00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:27.974
in my dreams than you should be.

566
00:39:27.974 --> 00:39:30.803
- Because I want to
help you. my dear.

567
00:39:30.803 --> 00:39:33.327
help guide you through
the dream state

568
00:39:33.327 --> 00:39:35.982
so you can see this through.

569
00:39:35.982 --> 00:39:40.203
And I can only do that if
you just fucking fall asleep!

570
00:39:42.292 --> 00:39:44.033
- Get off of me!

571
00:39:44.033 --> 00:39:45.687
- You should have
given her more.

572
00:39:46.732 --> 00:39:47.950
- I'm sorry. I thought I did.

573
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.474
- Wait? More what?

574
00:39:49.474 --> 00:39:53.478
- A simple drug. my
dear. to slow you down.

575
00:39:53.478 --> 00:39:56.002
help you along the way.

576
00:39:56.002 --> 00:40:01.007
The time is nigh. Reality and
the dream state are blending.

577
00:40:02.791 --> 00:40:04.880
That's why it's so important
for you to drink your tea.

578
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.491
Raziel. why don't you
make us all some tea?

579
00:40:06.491 --> 00:40:09.407
And be a doll. Raziel.
make it how I like it.

580
00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:12.105
- [Raziel] I've been
waiting for this all day.

581
00:40:12.105 --> 00:40:14.455
- You're enjoying
this way too much.

582
00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.154
You?

583
00:40:19.939 --> 00:40:21.854
- I'm sorry.

584
00:40:21.854 --> 00:40:25.771
- Apologies at this point
in time are so preposterous.

585
00:40:27.163 --> 00:40:30.036
He can't help but
take a liking to you.

586
00:40:30.036 --> 00:40:32.865
But in the end. he's
only doing the bidding

587
00:40:32.865 --> 00:40:35.128
of his mother and father.

588
00:40:40.176 --> 00:40:41.569
- Bring her to me.

589
00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:45.051
[Raziel groaning]

590
00:40:45.051 --> 00:40:47.532
- He grows impatient!

591
00:40:47.532 --> 00:40:52.537
- Raz?
[Raziel groaning]

592
00:40:53.233 --> 00:40:55.540
- He wants you!

593
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.106
- Bring her to me.

594
00:40:58.543 --> 00:41:00.196
[Raziel groaning]
[bones cracking]

595
00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:02.285
- Oh. enough of this!

596
00:41:02.285 --> 00:41:05.637
Show this harlot
what you really are!

597
00:41:05.637 --> 00:41:10.642
[Raziel groaning]
[bones cracking]

598
00:41:12.774 --> 00:41:15.342

[Abagail laughing]

601
00:41:35.928 --> 00:41:38.496
- Wakey-wakey. pretty. pretty.

602
00:41:40.367 --> 00:41:43.022
[bed rustling]

603
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:47.635
You should be resting.

604
00:41:49.071 --> 00:41:50.899
- How can I rest
after all of this?

605
00:41:50.899 --> 00:41:55.948
- Aww. Perhaps you
need a bedtime story.

606
00:41:56.775 --> 00:41:59.038
[Mara sighs]

607
00:41:59.038 --> 00:41:59.952
Hmm?

608
00:42:05.914 --> 00:42:09.527
Once upon a time.
there was a woman

609
00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:13.182
who wanted nothing more
than her own child.

610
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.273
Of course. by some
cruel twist of fate.

611
00:42:17.273 --> 00:42:22.278
she couldn't conceive. no
matter how hard she tried.

612
00:42:23.149 --> 00:42:26.152
Prayed. begged. nothing.

613
00:42:26.152 --> 00:42:27.719
Was all she could dream about.

614
00:42:29.155 --> 00:42:32.506
And then one day. her
dream was answered.

615
00:42:34.334 --> 00:42:35.248
- Your dream.

616
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:39.731
- My master heard my cries

617
00:42:39.731 --> 00:42:41.994
through the darkness
of the dream state.

618
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.563
He took pity on
my wretched soul.

619
00:42:47.347 --> 00:42:51.090
He answered my prayers. He
made my dream come true.

620
00:42:53.527 --> 00:42:55.485
He gave me his seed.

621
00:42:57.662 --> 00:43:01.796
a son for me. and his
vessel to the world.

622
00:43:04.494 --> 00:43:07.976
Oh. I know. to some.
he's a monstrosity.

623
00:43:07.976 --> 00:43:11.937
but to a loving mother. he's
nothing short of a miracle.

624
00:43:11.937 --> 00:43:13.112
- It's ready. Mother.

625
00:43:13.112 --> 00:43:17.333
- Oh. my dear boy.

626
00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:20.075
taking care of all
his mother's needs.

627
00:43:21.555 --> 00:43:22.687
All of them.

628
00:43:24.645 --> 00:43:27.561
- And doing this to me
is part of your needs?

629
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:30.346
- It's the price
I pay for my boy.

630
00:43:31.739 --> 00:43:33.349
Feed my master.

631
00:43:35.134 --> 00:43:38.877
He sees through Raziel. He
picks his meals through him.

632
00:43:38.877 --> 00:43:41.401
His women. prettier the better.

633
00:43:41.401 --> 00:43:45.666
Oh. the whores. all
alike. [chuckles]

634
00:43:45.666 --> 00:43:50.628
It is my pleasure and
honor to serve them to him.

635
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.543
- You bring the lambs
to the slaughter?

636
00:43:53.543 --> 00:43:58.548
- Oh. I know. I know.
I was hard on you.

637
00:43:59.593 --> 00:44:01.116
I said things I shouldn't have.

638
00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:05.817
But I have to admit.
I am going to delight

639
00:44:07.557 --> 00:44:10.386
in the thought of you
being torn limb from limb

640
00:44:11.736 --> 00:44:16.131
and your flesh sucked
from your bones.

641
00:44:16.131 --> 00:44:17.959

- Just shut up and
finish it already!

644
00:44:21.963 --> 00:44:23.138
- Oh. all right!

645
00:44:24.923 --> 00:44:27.839
Oh. let's use this.

646
00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:31.843

mouth open. [laughs]

Oh. won't be long now.

The only thing to smite the pain

658
00:45:20.674 --> 00:45:25.331
of you leaving is the
sight of you returning.

659
00:45:25.331 --> 00:45:28.334
- There will be no more exits.

660
00:45:28.334 --> 00:45:30.858
I'm here to see this through.

661
00:45:30.858 --> 00:45:33.339
- So you have
accepted your faith.

662
00:45:35.428 --> 00:45:36.734
- I couldn't stay away.

663
00:45:38.126 --> 00:45:40.912
I have my own urges
to satisfy now.

664
00:45:43.175 --> 00:45:46.526
- I have craved you
more than anyone.

665
00:45:48.658 --> 00:45:50.008
- Then you shall have me.

666
00:45:55.927 --> 00:45:57.493
- He's taking her.

667
00:45:59.104 --> 00:46:02.455
- I will grant you this.
your final pleasure.

668
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.504
- We will be rewarded.

669
00:46:08.504 --> 00:46:10.680

like the others.

own. baiting my own traps.

717
00:49:47.941 --> 00:49:50.248
I knew when I met
your vessel Raziel

718
00:49:50.248 --> 00:49:55.253
that he was protecting
something dark. ancient. you.

719
00:49:58.038 --> 00:50:01.563
but I wasn't expecting your
crone of a servant. though.

720
00:50:01.563 --> 00:50:05.263
She made things much more
complicated than needed.

721
00:50:05.263 --> 00:50:07.221
- Enough of this taunting.

722
00:50:07.221 --> 00:50:10.920
- You're not the only one who
likes to play with their food.

723
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.879
- End this.

724
00:50:12.879 --> 00:50:15.838
- You're in no position to
make any kind of demands.

725
00:50:15.838 --> 00:50:19.712
Now you can join the eons
worth of your victims.

726
00:50:19.712 --> 00:50:22.062
devoured like scraps of meat.

727
00:50:23.107 --> 00:50:26.284
You can die with that honor.

728
00:50:26.284 --> 00:50:29.069
[blood squelching]
[demon screaming]

729
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:31.332
[Abagail grunting]

730
00:50:31.332 --> 00:50:32.942
[knife clanks]

731
00:50:32.942 --> 00:50:37.556
[demon screaming]
[blood squelching]

732
00:50:45.085 --> 00:50:46.043
- So be it.

733
00:50:48.436 --> 00:50:51.396
[heart squelching]

734
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:57.837
[thunder crackling]

735
00:50:59.839 --> 00:51:02.581
[Mara laughing]

736
00:51:14.158 --> 00:51:16.290
- No! I don't understand!

737
00:51:17.596 --> 00:51:19.119
Oh my sweet boy...

738
00:51:20.903 --> 00:51:25.125
Oh. Mother will save you.
The bitch will pay for this.

739
00:51:28.041 --> 00:51:30.870
[dramatic music]

740
00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:35.570
[Abagail groaning]

741
00:51:42.577 --> 00:51:44.449
No. No. this can't be!

742
00:51:46.407 --> 00:51:50.237
- But it is. Your
master is no more.

743
00:51:50.237 --> 00:51:53.371
I should thank you for
bringing us together.

744
00:51:53.371 --> 00:51:55.982
He was most delicious.

745
00:51:57.026 --> 00:51:59.116
- What have you done. you bitch?

746
00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:01.640
- Merely what I have
done for centuries.

747
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.469
- Raziel? Raziel.

748
00:52:04.469 --> 00:52:08.690
Speak to me. Raziel.
answer me. I command you!

749
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:12.085
- Silence. hag! You have
no power over him anymore.

750
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:14.305
He serves a new master now.

751
00:52:14.305 --> 00:52:16.742
- No. No. no. no. no!

752
00:52:16.742 --> 00:52:19.397
Let my boy go! Release him!

753
00:52:19.397 --> 00:52:21.181
- You sure you
want me to do that?

754
00:52:21.181 --> 00:52:23.140
- You will do it.

755
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:28.145
Whatever you are. I will make
sure your soul pays for this!

756
00:52:29.015 --> 00:52:30.364
- Foolish old woman.

757
00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:34.586
You should stop concerning
yourself with what I am.

758
00:52:34.586 --> 00:52:37.371
and start thinking
about what I've done.

759
00:52:37.371 --> 00:52:40.896
think about what this
little. unassuming whore

760
00:52:40.896 --> 00:52:43.638
did to your all powerful master.

761
00:52:45.074 --> 00:52:47.512
And if I can do that to him.

762
00:52:47.512 --> 00:52:50.428
just imagine what I
have in store for you.

763
00:52:51.733 --> 00:52:52.604
Thinking?

764
00:52:54.083 --> 00:52:58.653
Better yet. why don't
we find out together?

765
00:53:00.612 --> 00:53:01.526
Raziel.

766
00:53:05.051 --> 00:53:06.183
Bring her to me.

767
00:53:07.096 --> 00:53:08.576
- No!

768
00:53:08.576 --> 00:53:09.534
No. no! No!

769
00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:15.235
[Abagail screaming]

770
00:53:23.548 --> 00:53:26.333
[dramatic music]

771
00:53:51.837 --> 00:53:55.449

foreign language]

773
