198
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.894
- And I was just going

199
00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:31.980
d

200
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.548
- You did it to me too.

201
00:06:32.588 --> 00:06:33.668
- I did it to you.

202
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.980
- And I was a nervous wreck.

203
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.146
and I was like. "Oh. my God!"

204
00:06:36.186 --> 00:06:36.980
- All right. so wait.

205
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.980
So my side of that was

206
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.261
when we were on the set

207
00:06:40.301 --> 00:06:40.980
of the pilot.

208
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.784
that was my first time.

209
00:06:42.824 --> 00:06:44.980
like. really doing dialogue.

210
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.348
- So you did

211
00:06:45.388 --> 00:06:46.648
everybody's dialogue?

212
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.980
- I learned everybody's.

213
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.980
So it's on the episode.

214
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.061
You can see it on the episodes.

215
00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:51.980
- Oh. yeah. you can see it.

216
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.666
- I saw one episode. though.

217
00:06:53.706 --> 00:06:54.980
where you're standing.

218
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.922
like. behind the couch

219
00:06:55.962 --> 00:06:56.980
in the living room scene.

220
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.980
- Yeah?

221
00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.434
- And it's you

222
00:06:58.474 --> 00:06:58.980
and whoever else.

223
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.980
- Was that Don Cheadle?

224
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.980
- Tray!

225
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.801
- Prince!

226
00:07:03.841 --> 00:07:04.980
Homey. homey!

227
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.980
[grunting]

228
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.008
- They literally had to show

229
00:07:08.048 --> 00:07:08.980
me. and I was like [gasps].

230
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.988
- That's the one that was like.

231
00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:12.980
"Okay. we need to change this."

232
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.720
- You don't go to school.

233
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.980
Ice Tray?

234
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.902
- Oh. sure I do.

235
00:07:14.942 --> 00:07:15.980
I've been held back

236
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.368
in the tenth grade

237
00:07:17.408 --> 00:07:18.980
three times in a row.

238
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.980
- Three times?

239
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.980
- Yeah. see. my motto is

240
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.869
when I find a grade I like.

241
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:25.000
I stick with it.

242
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.980
I stick with it.

243
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.044
- That's terrible.

244
00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:31.980
That's terrible.

245
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.869
Oh. wow.

246
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:35.980
Oh. that's painful to watch.

247
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.000
[laughter]

248
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.432
- She was so ugly that

249
00:07:38.472 --> 00:07:38.980
Freddy Krueger used to have

250
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.980
nightmares about her.

251
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.460
- Was it the fifth episode

252
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.980
when you finally had enough

253
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.152
and you were like--

254
00:07:45.192 --> 00:07:46.980
'cause I remember in rehears--

255
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.753
she just looked

256
00:07:47.793 --> 00:07:49.233
and she said. "Stop it!"

257
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.980
[laughter]

258
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.980
I knew everybody's lines.

259
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.785
I would have

260
00:07:53.825 --> 00:07:54.980
played Uncle Phil.

261
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.980
I could have played Aunt Viv.

262
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.825
I was--I knew

263
00:07:56.865 --> 00:07:57.980
everybody's words.

264
00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.740
Does anybody remember

265
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.980
their audition?

266
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:01.795
- I mean. I remember

267
00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:02.980
very little of it. obviously.

268
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.980
but. like. I do remember--

269
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:06.883
- Oh. no.

270
00:08:06.923 --> 00:08:07.980
- Oh! Ohhh!

271
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.244
- Alfonso Ribeiro.

272
00:08:09.284 --> 00:08:10.980
- You're ten. you're ten.

273
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.986
- Whoo!

274
00:08:12.026 --> 00:08:12.980
- Okay.

275
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.271
What am I wearing?

276
00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:14.980
[laughter]

277
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.107
What have you been

278
00:08:16.147 --> 00:08:16.980
doing in here?

279
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.980
- Just maxing and relaxing.

280
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.180
- I meant what have you been

281
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:20.980
doing to this room?

282
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.487
- Oh. I'm trying to make it

283
00:08:23.527 --> 00:08:25.980
a little more [indistinct].

284
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.980
Malcolm X. he's my hero.

285
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.640
- Well. he was a great man.

286
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.889
I don't know if I'd call him

287
00:08:31.929 --> 00:08:32.980
my hero exactly.

288
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.828
- Whoa. Wow.

289
00:08:34.868 --> 00:08:34.980
d

290
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:35.735
- All right.

291
00:08:35.775 --> 00:08:36.980
first. I would say--

292
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.006
- No. no. we're gonna give

293
00:08:38.046 --> 00:08:38.980
that a moment of silence!

294
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.980
- Okay. yes.

295
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.079
I know I didn't go there

296
00:08:42.119 --> 00:08:42.980
wearing a sweat suit

297
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.719
believing that I was gonna

298
00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:45.980
get that character.

299
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:46.362
I don't know

300
00:08:46.402 --> 00:08:46.980
what I was thinking.

301
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.758
I don't know

302
00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:48.980
how I got that job.

303
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.552
- You know what thought--

304
00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:49.980
- That dude sucked!

305
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.038
[laughter]

306
00:08:51.078 --> 00:08:51.980
- No. no.

307
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.980
- No.

308
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.616
- You are so much fun to watch.

309
00:08:54.656 --> 00:08:55.980
- Yeah. I wanna watch you.

310
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.174
- With everything you do.

311
00:08:57.214 --> 00:08:57.980
- Thank goodness.

312
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.902
I guess somewhere along

313
00:08:59.942 --> 00:09:01.980
the line people were able

314
00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.437
to see the magic

315
00:09:03.477 --> 00:09:05.980
that I clearly couldn't see.

316
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.081
- Do you remember

317
00:09:07.121 --> 00:09:07.980
your audition?

318
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.634
- They had me audition

319
00:09:08.674 --> 00:09:09.394
in New York.

320
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.314
and I remember my mom and

321
00:09:11.354 --> 00:09:12.980
my aunties being really excited

322
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.174
because I was auditioning

323
00:09:14.214 --> 00:09:14.980
for Quincy Jones.

324
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:15.980
That was my second call.

325
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.630
- Mm-hmm.

326
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.980
- Oh.

327
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.980
- And they had me rap.

328
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.980
but they had the kids.

329
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.674
like. last-minute.

330
00:09:21.714 --> 00:09:23.000
make up a rap.

331
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.980
- A rap?

332
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.600
- Like. I can sing.

333
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:25.980
I can't rap.

334
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.038
Like. that's a whole

335
00:09:27.078 --> 00:09:27.980
'nother skill set.

336
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.861

356
00:09:55.597 --> 00:09:55.980

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.980
- Karyn Parsons.

358
00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.165
Lord. have mercy on me.

359
00:09:59.205 --> 00:10:00.165

362
00:10:04.297 --> 00:10:04.980
Will's here.

363
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.980
- Hi.

364
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.980
Dad. I need $300.

365
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:08.862
Like. I'm going on the

366
00:10:08.902 --> 00:10:09.980

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.748
and it's gonna be Bruce Willis

369
00:10:13.788 --> 00:10:14.980
and Demi and Rob Lowe

370
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.042
and Emilio Estevez

371
00:10:17.082 --> 00:10:18.980
or Charlie Sheen.

372
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.980
I don't remember which.

373
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.504
- Wow.

374
00:10:21.544 --> 00:10:22.980
That's beautiful.

375
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.980
d

376
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.090
- I auditioned a lot.

377
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:26.980
- Did you really?

378
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.225
- I auditioned a lot.

379
00:10:28.265 --> 00:10:29.980
and I remember the network one

380
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.980
because it was down to--

381
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.854
there were. like.

382
00:10:32.894 --> 00:10:33.980
you know. two Hilarys.

383
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.980
and I was so nervous.

384
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.317
and I caught my reflection

385
00:10:37.357 --> 00:10:37.980
in something.

386
00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.986
and I remember I kinda

387
00:10:40.026 --> 00:10:41.980
started primping and--

388
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.000
[laughter]

389
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.401
And it was like.

390
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:45.980
I started feeling her.

391
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.565
She started. like.

392
00:10:46.605 --> 00:10:47.385
coming over--

393
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.592
- They're like. "You got it.

394
00:10:48.632 --> 00:10:48.980
You got the role!"

395
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.616
- No. but you could

396
00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:51.980
absolutely see--

397
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.980
see the Hilary.

398
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.075
- That was Hilary.

399
00:10:54.115 --> 00:10:54.980
- Come to life.

400
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.987
Even as little as the way

401
00:10:57.027 --> 00:10:58.980
you held your bottom jaw.

402
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.500
- Yeah. yeah. it's like--

403
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:00.980
- Right?

404
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.386
Like. it was so just.

405
00:11:02.426 --> 00:11:02.980
like. ha.

406
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.831
- I'm in a bad mood. and

407
00:11:04.871 --> 00:11:06.980
somebody is going to suffer.

408
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.091
- I didn't go to the audition

409
00:11:09.131 --> 00:11:10.980
in 1990 because they said.

410
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.367
"Oh. we want you to audition

411
00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:14.980
for this new sitcom

412
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:15.867
with a rapper."

413
00:11:15.907 --> 00:11:16.980
I said. "Mm. pass."

414
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.980
[laughter]

415
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.815
I said. "Um. um.

416
00:11:21.855 --> 00:11:23.980
thank you. no. no."

417
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.441
And I left.

418
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:24.980
and I watched

419
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.980
the show come on in September.

420
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.144
I said. "Oh. damn.

421
00:11:28.184 --> 00:11:28.980
that's cute."

422
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:29.980
[laughter]

423
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.561
- Got this whole town

424
00:11:31.601 --> 00:11:32.980
of Bel-Air buzzing.

425
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.880
- Get a load of me

426
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.980
and my rapping cousin!

427
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.980
- Yeah. you know.

428
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.191
So Quincy Jones basically

429
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:42.000
steamrolled me

430
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.980
through the whole process

431
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.378
without ever really

432
00:11:45.418 --> 00:11:46.980
auditioning me. right?

433
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.588
So the only kind of audition

434
00:11:49.628 --> 00:11:50.980
I had was the--

435
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.000
Quincy's birthday.

436
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.980
The show was an idea.

437
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.877
Benny Medina had

438
00:11:56.917 --> 00:11:57.980
pitched me the idea.

439
00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.834
and it's like.

440
00:11:58.874 --> 00:11:59.980
I was making music.

441
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:00.868
and they were like.

442
00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:01.980
"Come to Quincy's house.

443
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.049
We have this idea

444
00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:03.980
for a TV show."

445
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.980
I'm like. "Okay." you know?

446
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.980
- "I'll go to Quincy's."

447
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.980
So I got to Quincy's house.

448
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.487
and Benny Medina pitched me

449
00:12:11.527 --> 00:12:12.980
the whole idea of the show.

450
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.943
and he's like. you know.

451
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:14.980
"We have this--this idea."

452
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:15.886
'cause it was based

453
00:12:15.926 --> 00:12:16.980
on Benny Medina's life.

454
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.980
- His life. right.

455
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.523
- He went from Watts

456
00:12:19.563 --> 00:12:19.980
to Beverly Hills.

457
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.836
So I'm like. "Cool."

458
00:12:20.876 --> 00:12:21.980
so we go to Quincy's house.

459
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.201
and Benny's like.

460
00:12:23.241 --> 00:12:24.980
"Hey. you know. this is--

461
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.580
this is the Fresh Prince."

462
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.311
Quincy said.

463
00:12:27.351 --> 00:12:27.980
"I know who that boy is.

464
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:28.951
I seen his stuff." you know?

465
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:29.980
"Hey. come on in. Come on in."

466
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.980
So Quincy. it's his birthday.

467
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.961
He had been tasting

468
00:12:33.001 --> 00:12:33.980
a little bit. right?

469
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.985
So he was--he was

470
00:12:35.025 --> 00:12:35.980
wetting his beak.

471
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:36.980
He wet his beak. right?

472
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.334
So he--you know. he's like.

473
00:12:38.374 --> 00:12:38.980
"Come on in."

474
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:39.711
So we go in.

475
00:12:39.751 --> 00:12:40.980
and he said--he said.

476
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.772
"Where you from?"

477
00:12:41.812 --> 00:12:42.980
I said. "I'm from Philly."

478
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.317
He said. "Your character's

479
00:12:44.357 --> 00:12:44.980
from Philly."

480
00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:45.867
"Oh."

481
00:12:45.907 --> 00:12:47.980
Like. "Okay.

482
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.160
Give me a glass of whatever

483
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:49.980
Quincy's drinking."

484
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.980
Right?

485
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:52.738
So it's like--

486
00:12:52.778 --> 00:12:53.980
it's Quincy's birthday.

487
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:54.434
so it's like--

488
00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:54.980
it's a big party.

489
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.441
so everybody's in there.

490
00:12:56.481 --> 00:12:56.980
you know?

491
00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.980
So it was Brandon Tartikoff.

492
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.980
who's the head of NBC.

493
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.210
Warren Littlefield.

494
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:02.980
all of that.

495
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.185
So everybody gets in the room.

496
00:13:04.225 --> 00:13:04.980
and Quincy. he says.

497
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:05.303
"Hey!

498
00:13:05.343 --> 00:13:06.980
Clear the living room out!

499
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.006
Clear the living room out!

500
00:13:08.046 --> 00:13:08.980
We gonna do an audition."

501
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:09.949
- Oh. man.

502
00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:11.980
- You like go. "Who?"

503
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:12.609
- Right. I'm saying.

504
00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:12.980
"Who? Who--"

505
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.276
Yeah. "Who's gonna audition?"

506
00:13:14.316 --> 00:13:14.980
And he was like.

507
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:15.841
"Yeah. you got it.

508
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:16.980
You got it. You got it."

509
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.345
I said. "Q. Q. no. no."

510
00:13:19.385 --> 00:13:20.980
and he grabs me.

511
00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.894
and he takes me

512
00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:22.980
in the other room.

513
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.135
and he sits me down

514
00:13:24.175 --> 00:13:24.980
in his office.

515
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.915
and there's a 48 million

516
00:13:27.955 --> 00:13:29.980
"Thriller" thing.

517
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.980
There's a "Color Purple."

518
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.704
and he sits me under this

519
00:13:34.744 --> 00:13:36.980
70 Grammys. you know.

520
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.624
this Em--and I'm sitting under

00:13:38.664 --> 00:13:39.980
all of that stuff. like--

522
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.041
and Michael's looking down

523
00:13:42.081 --> 00:13:42.980
on me like--

524
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.980
[laughter]

525
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.980
So Quincy says.

526
00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.373
"Okay. what do you need?"

527
00:13:49.413 --> 00:13:49.980
and I said.

528
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.350
"Quincy. I'm the--I don't

529
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.980
know how to--I'm not an actor.

530
00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.341
"I just--just give me

531
00:13:54.381 --> 00:13:54.980
two weeks.

532
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.257
"Let me find an acting coach.

533
00:13:57.297 --> 00:13:58.980
and let me work on it.

534
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.141
and then let's just set up

535
00:14:00.181 --> 00:14:00.980
a proper audition."

536
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.026
He said. "Oh. so two weeks.

537
00:14:02.066 --> 00:14:02.980
You only need two weeks?"

538
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.097
I said. "Yeah. yeah.

539
00:14:04.137 --> 00:14:04.980
just two weeks."

540
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.980
He said. "So here's the deal.

541
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.980
"Right now everybody

542
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.307
"that needs to say yes

543
00:14:10.347 --> 00:14:11.980

544
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.228

545
00:14:13.268 --> 00:14:14.980
right now waiting for you."

546
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:15.980
- It's now.

547
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.980
- And I was like--

548
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:18.985
I was like.

549
00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:20.980
"Give me ten minutes."

550
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.025
And he's like. "All right!

551
00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:22.980
Audition in ten minutes!

552
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.980
Audition in ten minutes!"

553
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.980
- Far out.

554
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:27.652
- They did a deal memo

555
00:14:27.692 --> 00:14:27.980
that night.

556
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.681
That's how we got

557
00:14:29.721 --> 00:14:31.980
to the pilot that fast.

558
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:32.504
- Whoa.

559
00:14:32.544 --> 00:14:33.980
- How is it possible

560
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.929
I've known you this long

561
00:14:34.969 --> 00:14:35.980
and never heard that story?

562
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:36.345
- I know.

563
00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:36.980
- I know. right?

564
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.044
- Do you remember.

565
00:14:38.084 --> 00:14:38.980
we were on tour?

566
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:39.980
- We were in Detroit. yep.

567
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:40.958
- We were on tour

568
00:14:40.998 --> 00:14:41.980
and had a day off.

569
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:42.347
- Yep.

570
00:14:42.387 --> 00:14:43.980
- And Will flew and came...

571
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:44.571
- To go to

572
00:14:44.611 --> 00:14:45.980
"The Arsenio Hall Show."

573
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.236
- And said. "I got a TV show."

574
00:14:48.276 --> 00:14:49.000
[laughter]

575
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.524
Being from Philly.

576
00:14:51.564 --> 00:14:52.980
"I got a TV show"

577
00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:53.850
was a homeboy

578

the very first show that I did.

You eat here never.

869
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.755
- Looks like

00:23:06.795 --> 00:23:08.000

One day we filmed maybe

874
00:23:18.657 --> 00:23:20.980
about 150 takes

875
00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.064

876
00:23:22.104 --> 00:23:22.980

Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

878
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.027
I think they didn't want

879
00:23:27.067 --> 00:23:27.980
to torture me anymore.

880
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.016
so that's the reason why they

881
00:23:30.056 --> 00:23:31.980
started using the same shot.

882
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.760
and then that became a thing.

883
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.314

so many things.

but one that comes to mind

897
00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:52.980
right away of my favorite

898
00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:53.980
is when you lost your mind

899
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:54.509

how to do that?

00:29:59.020 --> 00:29:59.515
- Take your notes.

1156
00:29:59.555 --> 00:29:59.980
- Say this line.

1157
00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:00.567
- Yeah.

1158
00:30:00.607 --> 00:30:01.980
- Move over here.

1159
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.967
- At some point the producers

1160
00:30:04.007 --> 00:30:04.980
and the writers

1161
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.486
wanted to make Hilary

1162
00:30:06.526 --> 00:30:07.980
a strong Black woman.

1163
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.420
They wanted to. like.

1164
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.980
see that switch in her.

1165
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.386
and then I felt like.

1166
00:30:12.426 --> 00:30:12.980
you know.

1167
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.561
there are some people

1168
00:30:14.601 --> 00:30:15.980
who are just flawed

1169
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.980
and see things a certain way.

1170
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.852
and you can learn a lot

1171
00:30:19.892 --> 00:30:20.980
from them too.

1172
00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.980
Look. I'm a career woman.

1173
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.580
I don't have time to dust

1174
00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.980
and push around that--

1175
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.986
oh. what do you call

1176
00:30:27.026 --> 00:30:27.980
that big. loud thing

1177
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.980
that sucks up everything?

1178
00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.013
- We were able to share

1179
00:30:33.053 --> 00:30:34.980
the experience.

1180
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.302
the real experience

1181
00:30:37.342 --> 00:30:39.980
and gave those writers

1182
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:40.680
our perspective.

1183
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:40.980
- Yeah.

1184
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.730
- You can put your hands

1185
00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:44.980
down. Jazz.

1186
00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:45.675
- No way.

1187
00:30:45.715 --> 00:30:46.980
Dude's got a gun.

1188
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.870
Next thing you know. I got

1189
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.000
six warning shots in my back.

1190
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.047
When we did

1191
00:30:53.087 --> 00:30:54.980
the courtroom scene.

1192
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.580
there was a level

1193
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.980
of truth to it.

1194
00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.472
That's the reason

1195
00:30:58.512 --> 00:30:58.980
why they wrote it.

1196
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.261
I'm putting

1197
00:31:01.301 --> 00:31:04.980
my hands down now.

1198
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:05.825
- Part of the power

1199
00:31:05.865 --> 00:31:06.980
of what we would always do

1200
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.980
with "The Fresh Prince."

1201
00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.681
there would be

1202
00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:12.980
very powerful ideas

1203
00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.233
under the jokes

1204
00:31:14.273 --> 00:31:15.980
and under the comedy.

1205
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.515
- You can wear the T-shirts.

1206
00:31:17.555 --> 00:31:18.980
you can put up the posters.

1207
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:19.980
and you can shout the slogans.

1208
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.254
but unless you know

1209
00:31:21.294 --> 00:31:22.980
all the history behind it.

1210
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.451
you're trivializing

1211
00:31:24.491 --> 00:31:25.980
the entire struggle.

1212
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.399
- That is one of those things

1213
00:31:27.439 --> 00:31:28.159
that I think

1214
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.980
kinda makes people understand

1215
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.226
just how groundbreaking

1216
00:31:32.266 --> 00:31:32.980
this show was.

1217
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.980
- It is as relevant today

1218
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.470
as it was 30 years ago.

1219
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.980
unfortunately.

1220
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.880
- Whenever we would come

1221
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.980
across moments

1222
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.624
that they wrote that was like.

1223
00:31:44.664 --> 00:31:45.980
"This wouldn't happen..."

1224
00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:46.805
- Right.

1225
00:31:46.845 --> 00:31:49.980
- "Black people don't do this."

1226
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.129
- Right.

1227
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.980
- Yes.

1228
00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.433
- Tuesday and Wednesday is

1229
00:31:53.473 --> 00:31:54.980
what made this show special.

1230
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.445
because we made sure that we

1231
00:31:57.485 --> 00:32:00.000
were authentic every episode.

1232
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.815
- I had spent a career

1233
00:32:02.855 --> 00:32:03.980
being on shows

1234
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.552
that showed the variety

1235
00:32:05.592 --> 00:32:06.980
of the Black culture.

1236
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.016
showing that we were not just

1237
00:32:09.056 --> 00:32:10.980
a monolithic group of people

1238
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.241
with one idea

1239
00:32:12.281 --> 00:32:13.980
and one lifestyle.

1240
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:14.980
and when I got here.

1241
00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.244
we had the freedom

1242
00:32:16.284 --> 00:32:17.980
to express to the writers

1243
00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.945
the cultural aspects of what

1244
00:32:19.985 --> 00:32:21.980
they had in the written word.

1245
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.015
I remember a table read

1246
00:32:24.055 --> 00:32:24.980
one Monday.

1247
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.915
and there was some line that

1248
00:32:26.955 --> 00:32:28.980
they had given Tatyana to say.

1249
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.980
and I said. "Excuse me.

1250
00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.980
if Tatyana says that

1251
00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:33.724
to her daddy.

1252
00:32:33.764 --> 00:32:34.980
she'd lose her teeth."

1253
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:35.850
- Yeah. yeah.

1254
00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:36.980
exactly. exactly.

1255
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.064
- So no. culturally.

1256
00:32:38.104 --> 00:32:38.980
we don't do that.

1257
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:39.886
- James used to sit

1258
00:32:39.926 --> 00:32:41.306
where you're sitting...

1259
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:42.179

1260
00:32:42.219 --> 00:32:42.980
- That was James's spot.

1261
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.980
- During those note sessions.

1262
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.726
and that is where I learned

1263
00:32:47.766 --> 00:32:47.980
that

1264
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:52.980
what we do is not for us.

1265
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.980
It's not about us.

1266
00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.084
We are here

1267
00:32:57.124 --> 00:32:58.980

1268
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.980
- Mm-hmm.

1269
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.700
- To represent. to expand.

1270
00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.980
to push forward.

1271
00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.613
and I learned that here

1272
00:33:09.653 --> 00:33:10.980

1286
00:33:34.027 --> 00:33:34.980
of jazz music.

1287
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.291
and I would spend a lot

1288

of times in his dressing room.

1289

1299
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.460
was always just amazing.

1300
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.480
- Ashley. honey.

1301
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:54.980
this is possibly

1302
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.283
the most beautiful music

00:34:01.466 --> 00:34:02.980
to be an artist from him.

1307
00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.298

1308

00:34:54.947 --> 00:34:55.980
- Yeah.

1345
00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:56.987
- You know. that history.

1346
00:34:57.027 --> 00:34:57.980
and those notes sessions.

1347
00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.346
that's where I went to school.

1348
00:34:59.386 --> 00:34:59.980
like. that's--

1349
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:00.803
- And that was--

1350
00:35:00.843 --> 00:35:01.980
no. that was the thing.

1351
00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.980
James. he pushed me so hard.

1352
00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.980
- You think you're so wise.

1353
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:09.867
Look at me

1354
00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:12.000
when I'm talking to you.

1355
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.980
Let me tell you something. son.

1356
00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.248
I grew up on the streets

1357
00:35:17.288 --> 00:35:18.128
just like you.

1358
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.448
I encountered bigotry

1359
00:35:20.488 --> 00:35:21.980
you could not imagine.

1360
00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.020
Now. you have a nice poster

1361
00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.980
of Malcolm X on your wall.

1362
00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.980
I heard the brother speak.

1363
00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.980
I read every word he wrote.

1364
00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:32.904
Believe me.

1365
00:35:32.944 --> 00:35:35.000
I know where I come from.

1366
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.936
- His thing was that I am

1367
00:35:37.976 --> 00:35:39.980
in such a unique position.

1368
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.754
and that responsibility.

1369
00:35:42.794 --> 00:35:45.980
you must elevate your craft.

1370
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.392
You have to represent.

1371
00:35:47.432 --> 00:35:48.980
and you are paving a way.

1372
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.097
and he just wouldn't

1373
00:35:50.137 --> 00:35:50.980
give me an inch.

1374
00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.229
and I remember in the--

1375
00:35:53.269 --> 00:35:54.980
one of my favorite

1376
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.134
and most famous scenes

1377
00:35:57.174 --> 00:35:58.980
from "Fresh Prince"

1378
00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.340
is the father episode.

1379
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.344
Hey. what's up. man?

1380
00:36:02.384 --> 00:36:03.980
Can I get you something?

1381
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.000
- No. I'm fine. son.

1382
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
- Um. if you need--

1383
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
- So is he a cop?

1384
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.980
- He's my father.

1385
00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.980
So. you know. James Avery

1386
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.980
was this 6'4".

1387
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.980
300-pound...

1388
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.486
- Plus.

1389
00:36:29.526 --> 00:36:30.980
- Yeah.

1390
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.146
- Stage-trained...

1391
00:36:33.186 --> 00:36:33.980
- Yeah.

1392
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.980
- Shakespearean beast. right?

1393
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.018
And I'm--I'm the little rapper

1394
00:36:39.058 --> 00:36:40.980
from Philly under him. right?

1395
00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.728
And I wanted him to think

1396
00:36:42.768 --> 00:36:43.980
I was good so bad.

1397
00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:44.441
- You wanted him

1398
00:36:44.481 --> 00:36:44.980
to be proud of you.

1399
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:45.861
- I wanted him

1400
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:46.980
to be proud of me.

1401
00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.280
so the episode comes.

1402
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.146
and. you know.

1403
00:36:50.186 --> 00:36:51.980
we come to that scene.

1404
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.820
and I was like. I'm--you know.

1405
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.890
I wanna deliver

1406
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:55.980
this scene so bad.

1407
00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.319
and if you remember.

1408
00:36:57.359 --> 00:36:58.980
in front of the audience.

1409
00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.918
I flubbed my line

1410
00:37:01.958 --> 00:37:03.980
on the take.

1411
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:04.980
- Mm-hmm.

1412
00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.874
- And I messed it up

1413
00:37:05.914 --> 00:37:07.414
in front of the audience.

1414
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.929
and my mind snapped.

1415
00:37:09.969 --> 00:37:11.980
and I'm like. "Aghh!"

1416
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.483
I'm like.

1417
00:37:13.523 --> 00:37:15.980
"Ahh! Damn it!"

1418
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.484
And James says.

1419
00:37:17.524 --> 00:37:17.980
"Hey!

1420
00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.980
Right here!"

1421
00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.837
and I was like--and

1422
00:37:21.877 --> 00:37:24.000
he was like. "Use me!"

1423
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.807
And I'm like--

1424
00:37:26.847 --> 00:37:27.980
and I'm right there.

1425
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.065
and he takes. and he's like.

1426
00:37:29.105 --> 00:37:30.545
"Get yourself together."

1427
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.143
And I get it together.

1428
00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:32.980
and I'm looking.

1429
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:33.980
and he says. "Action."

1430
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:34.980
- I'm sorry. I--

1431
00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:35.883
You know. if there was

1432
00:37:35.923 --> 00:37:36.980
something that I could do--

1433
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.004
- Hey. you know what? You ain't

1434
00:37:38.044 --> 00:37:38.980
got to do nothing. Uncle Phil.

1435
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.624
You know. ain't like I'm still

1436
00:37:40.664 --> 00:37:41.980
five years old. you know?

1437
00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.036
Ain't like I'ma be sitting up

1438
00:37:43.076 --> 00:37:43.980
every night asking my mom.

1439
00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.604
"When is Daddy coming home?"

1440
00:37:45.644 --> 00:37:46.980
You know? Who needs him?

1441
00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.980
And the scene that we do

1442
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.754
is the scene that ended up

1443
00:37:51.794 --> 00:37:53.980
being in the episode.

1444
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:54.922
I ain't need him then.

1445
00:37:54.962 --> 00:37:55.980
and I don't need him now.

1446
00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:56.980
- Will. Will--

1447
00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.297
- Nah. you know what.

1448
00:37:58.337 --> 00:37:58.980
Uncle Phil?

1449
00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.319
I'ma get through college

1450
00:38:00.359 --> 00:38:00.980
without him.

1451
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:01.600
I'm get a great job

1452
00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:01.980
without him.

1453
00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:02.825
I'ma marry me

1454
00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:03.980
a beautiful honey.

1455
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:04.826
and I'ma have me

1456
00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:05.980
a whole bunch of kids.

1457
00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:06.560
I'ma be a better father

1458
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:06.980
than he ever was!

1459
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:07.858
And I sure as hell

1460
00:38:07.898 --> 00:38:08.980
don't need him for that

1461
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.046
'cause ain't a damn thing

1462
00:38:10.086 --> 00:38:10.980
he could ever teach me

1463
00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.000
about how to love my kids!

1464
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
d

1465
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.680
How come he don't

1466
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.000
want me. man?

1467
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.480
And I fall into his arms

1468
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.980
at the end of the scene.

1469
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.980
and he's holding me.

1470
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:31.861
and. you know.

1471
00:38:31.901 --> 00:38:32.980
the shot pans off.

1472
00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:33.602
and he whispered

1473
00:38:33.642 --> 00:38:33.980
in my ear.

1474
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:34.869
he said.

1475
00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:37.980
"Now. that's acting." right?

1476
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:38.980
- That's right.

1477
00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.336
- "That's acting."

1478
00:38:40.376 --> 00:38:41.980
and I was like. "Ahh!"

1479
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.980
[laughter]

1480
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:44.951
You know. every single time.

1481
00:38:44.991 --> 00:38:46.791
- I cry every time I see that.

1482
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.359
- Every single time.

1483
00:38:48.399 --> 00:38:48.980
you know?

1484
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.390
And it's like. he just--

1485
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.000
he. um--he. uh--

1486
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.226
it's like--oh. come on.

1487
00:38:56.266 --> 00:38:56.980
Don't do this.

1488
00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.246
- I know. I'm s--

1489
00:38:58.286 --> 00:38:58.980
I'm sorry.

1490
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.980
- Tatyana throwing me off.

1491
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.980
[laughter]

1492
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.000
And it's like. when--

1493
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:07.980
it's like. people do--

1494
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.900
people don't even know

1495
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.980
when they're shaping you

1496
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:12.920
and forming you

1497
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.980
and crafting you.

1498
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:14.629
- He knew.

1499
00:39:14.669 --> 00:39:15.980
- In that w--he knew.

1500
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.187
No. that's what I'm saying.

1501
00:39:17.227 --> 00:39:17.980
- I think he knew.

1502
00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.980
- He knew what he was doing.

1503
00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:20.538
- There's some people

1504
00:39:20.578 --> 00:39:20.980
that plant seeds.

1505
00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:21.409
- Yep.

1506
00:39:21.449 --> 00:39:22.980
- That's what they do.

1507
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:24.740
And they do it to anyone

1508
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.980
they come across.

1509
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.585
- I mean. he was--

1510
00:39:27.625 --> 00:39:29.980
he was proud of who he was.

1511
00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:30.980
He was proud of his race.

1512
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.370
He was proud of the history

1513
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:32.980
of his race.

1514
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.980
- Yes.

1515
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.744
- And. you know.

1516
00:39:35.784 --> 00:39:36.980
he could see it. you know?

1517
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:37.688
And it fell upon you.

1518
00:39:37.728 --> 00:39:37.980
you know?

1519
00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.927
It fell upon you

1520
00:39:39.967 --> 00:39:41.980
to grab the rein.

1521
00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:42.980
- Vote for Philip Banks.

1522
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.980
Philip Banks.

1523
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.980
Break out Lucille.

1524
00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:48.980
[laughter]

1525
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.980
[upbeat music]

1526
00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.235
I've got a few questions

1527
00:39:54.275 --> 00:39:54.980
for you.

1528
00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:55.666
When you got

1529
00:39:55.706 --> 00:39:56.980

2302
01:04:02.627 --> 01:04:04.980
the essence of the show.
