3
00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:46.375
From time immemorial.

4
00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:48.458
the ancient Ukrainian forest

5
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.791
has harboured amazing secrets
and mysteries.

6
00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:54.625
Behind the Dark Mountain.

7
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.250
in the forest's heart.

8
00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:58.541
the Source of Life is hidden.

9
00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:01.916
It provides the forest
and its dwellers

10
00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.750
with their power. their spark.

11
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:07.291
But one winter.

12
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.166
while the forest
was fast asleep.

13
00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:12.791
with the guardian alone
watching over it.

14
00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:16.083
a human broke into the forest

15
00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:18.375
through the passage
in the Dark Mountain.

16
00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:21.208
It was the owner of the sawmill.

17
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.416
He needed at least one drop
from the Source of Life

18
00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:28.458
to save his dying
newborn daughter.

19
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.875
But then he returned
and brought an army with him.

20
00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:36.458
hoping to take over
the entire Source for himself.

21
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.833
And so a terrible battle began

22
00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.458
that left no winners.

23
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.750
Only losers.

24
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.291
All humans who had trespassed

25
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:49.166
behind the Dark Mountain
vanished.

26
00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:52.208
The Forest Guardian

27
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.458
lost all but an echo
of his ancient strength.

28
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.375
And when the forest creatures
woke in the spring.

29
00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:03.750
they were greeted by
the horrific consequences

30
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:05.625
of the humans' treachery.

31
00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:10.041
Look at what
our enemies have done.

32
00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:12.083
For this reason.

33
00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:15.000
no human shall set foot

34
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:18.666
behind the Dark Mountain
ever again!

35
00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:21.916
This is the new forest law.

36
00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:28.166
Many years have passed
since that day.

37
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.708
Another winter is over.

38
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.708
Oh. I've slept so long.

39
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.708
I was having
the loveliest dream.

40
00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:09.666
But this is better
than any dream.

41
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:24.166
It's finally spring.

42
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.375
Swampy!

43
00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:59.416
It's the best part
of the best day of the year.

44
00:03:59.458 --> 00:04:01.875
Time to wake up the forest.

45
00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:27.583
Hark! Hush. the master
of sounds. approaches.

46
00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:29.791
Happy spring. Mavka!

47
00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:32.583
Hush! You can fly?!

48
00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:35.208
That's kind of huge news.

49
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.416
They'll call me Hush.
who conquered the sky!

50
00:05:38.458 --> 00:05:40.166
Just don't tell Lesh.

51
00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:42.750
He'll think
I'm stork-raving mad.

52
00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:55.500
Whoa!

53
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.125
Yeah! One more! More!

54
00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.250
And the fans go wild!

55
00:06:58.291 --> 00:07:01.208
We are so ready
to conquer the world.

56
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.250
Settle down. kid.
Hometown crowd.

57
00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:06.000
Everybody knows us here.

58
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:08.333
Wow. I'm just so nervous.

59
00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:10.125
What if things don't work out
in the city?

60
00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:13.041
There are so many
other musicians there.

61
00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:15.125
You have to believe
in yourself. Nina.

62
00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:17.125
and let the music
show us the way.

63
00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:20.041
Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

64
00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:23.166
What was that?

65
00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:35.291
"Big money
for an important job?"

66
00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:38.583
Hm. not for a soon-to-be
musical legend like me.

67
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.791
But maybe Uncle Leo
can use this.

68
00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:43.250
Lucas. your uncle.

69
00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:45.083
he's not feeling well.

70
00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:47.083
They called the healer
and everything.

71
00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:49.083
Get home. quick.

72
00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:50.875
Hopefully we'll see you
at the fair later.

73
00:07:56.916 --> 00:07:59.166
-Hey. look!
-What is it?

74
00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:15.875
Greetings.

75
00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:19.333
after so long.
my dear fellow villagers.

76
00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:21.500
It is I. Kylina.

77
00:08:21.541 --> 00:08:25.916
the daughter and only heiress
of the late sawmill owner.

78
00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.541
The one that got burned up
by forest demons?

79
00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:32.750
Yes. my father died tragically

80
00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:35.166
in a forest wildfire.

81
00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:38.875
but it had nothing to do
with your quaint superstitions.

82
00:08:38.916 --> 00:08:42.750
After dear Daddy's death.
my mother and I left this place.

83
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:46.041
but soon I became an orphan.

84
00:08:46.083 --> 00:08:47.958
-Oh. poor thing. What a shame.

85
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.208
How positively tragic!

86
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:57.833
But now I am back to make
our village prosperous again.

87
00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:00.708
I'm offering you all a job.

88
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.458
You'll have so much money

89
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.916
that you'll never
have to work again.

90
00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.000
Not working is my dream job.

91
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:09.458
I'll rebuild the sawmill.

92
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.916
We'll start selling our timber
all around the world.

93
00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:17.291
Aren't you all good and ready
to become rich and happy?

94
00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:18.375
-Yeah!
-Absolutely.

95
00:09:18.416 --> 00:09:20.291
-Yes!
-What do you want us to do?

96
00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:23.250
All you have to do is pop over
the Dark Mountain...

97
00:09:23.291 --> 00:09:25.625
What?

98
00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:27.416
Oh. she's cuckoo.

99
00:09:27.458 --> 00:09:29.958
Ugh. just like her father.

100
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.750
But I'm talking huge money.

101
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:35.166
You can't buy another life.

102
00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:38.583
Tell the evil spirits I said hi.

103
00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:43.916
-What's that?

104
00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:05.083
Easy. easy.

105
00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:11.583
What's the matter?

106
00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:17.875
A trap!

107
00:10:17.916 --> 00:10:19.750
Probably left
from the old times.

108
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:23.333
Huh?

109
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.708
Huh?

110
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:56.000
The guardian is calling us.

111
00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.208
Uh. how is he?

112
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.416
He's holding on. but my herbs
can only do so much.

113
00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:08.708
Leo needs real medicine
from the city.

114
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.666
But...it's not going
to be cheap.

115
00:11:12.833 --> 00:11:14.041
Uh...

116
00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:19.166
"Per-du-cabri-co-carum"?

117
00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:22.291
Just give this to the pharmacist
in the city.

118
00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:23.875
He'll understand.

119
00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.875
Thank you. Sincerely.

120
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.041
Great news. Uncle.

121
00:11:31.083 --> 00:11:32.958
A little perdi-caca-something-um

122
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.166
and you'll be good as new.

123
00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:42.458
Lucas. what are you doing?

124
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.583
You can't waste
your money on me.

125
00:11:44.625 --> 00:11:49.166
I'm old and I've had
a good long run.

126
00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:56.625
Spend it on a nice girl.
get settled down...

127
00:11:56.666 --> 00:12:00.541
..so your old uncle
can die in peace.

128
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:04.000
Nobody's going to D-word.

129
00:12:04.041 --> 00:12:06.958
I'll find the money
some...where.

130
00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:13.375
Uncle. you'll be fine.
I've got you.

131
00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:15.583
-I've got you!

132
00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:33.625
Oh. madam.
it's your family mansion.

133
00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:35.708
How...rustic.

134
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.041
Ugh. it's just
a revolting hovel.

135
00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:43.250
A bunch of pathetic cowards!

136
00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:45.666
All my plans are at risk

137
00:12:45.708 --> 00:12:49.500
just because this primitive mob
is terrified by the forest.

138
00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:51.708
-Move it. Frol!

139
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.375
Oh. ma'am. Right away.
Just a second.

140
00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:59.833
Do me a favour and get
these peasant rags off me.

141
00:12:59.875 --> 00:13:02.833
How can they wear
this hideous stuff?!

142
00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:06.166
Ugh. I hate it.
Get rid of it right away.

143
00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:10.041
What a terrible piece
of tasteless trash.

144
00:13:10.083 --> 00:13:11.958
Stupid. uneducated.
superstitious mob.

145
00:13:13.041 --> 00:13:15.375
-Frol!
-Oh. my God.

146
00:13:15.416 --> 00:13:16.875
This is so old-fashioned.

147
00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:21.708
Don't get me upset. Frol.

148
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.500
It's bad for my complexion.

149
00:13:23.541 --> 00:13:25.666
Oh. sure. madam.

150
00:13:25.708 --> 00:13:27.250
-Oh!

151
00:13:35.416 --> 00:13:38.041
Clumsy idiots!

152
00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:41.125
Inside this case is...

153
00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:44.958
Just be careful with it.

154
00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:47.791
Mm?

155
00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:50.166
What is it?

156
00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:51.750
Uh. about this job offer...

157
00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:53.041
Oh. forget it.

158
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.458
Who's there?

159
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.916
Frol!

160
00:13:57.416 --> 00:13:59.583
Oh. about THAT job offer?

161
00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:01.041
Please come in.

162
00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:10.708
Hi. My name's Lucas.

163
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.291
It says you'll pay well.

164
00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:13.666
Hmm.

165
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.333
Hmm.

166
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:25.375
I will.

167
00:14:25.416 --> 00:14:27.208
If you're up to it.

168
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.541
Uh. I am.

169
00:14:29.583 --> 00:14:31.125
I can do any job.

170
00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:32.375
Good.

171
00:14:32.416 --> 00:14:35.375
Eric. Derek. you go with him.

172
00:14:38.458 --> 00:14:40.833
So...what do I have to do?

173
00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:43.125
Find me the tree with this leaf.

174
00:14:45.541 --> 00:14:46.750
Uh... Huh!

175
00:14:46.791 --> 00:14:50.166
In the forest
behind the Dark Mountain.

176
00:14:53.375 --> 00:14:55.166
Hmm.

177
00:14:56.416 --> 00:14:57.791
FOREST-DWELLER: What happened?

178
00:14:57.833 --> 00:14:59.833
The guardian
is summoning everybody?

179
00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:02.958
This hasn't happened
since I was a sapling.

180
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.750
-I'd rather take a nap.
-The guardian?!

181
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.708
Greetings upon the new spring.

182
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.958
my fellow forest-dwellers.

183
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.958
Is everyone here?

184
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.666
Mavka. did you wake
everybody up?

185
00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:32.916
She's probably frolicking

186
00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.791
through the crocuses
with Swampy again.

187
00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.458
-I'm sorry I'm late. Guardian.

188
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.083
I was helping the lynx cub
get out of an old trap.

189
00:15:43.458 --> 00:15:46.000
-How terrible!
-An old trap.

190
00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:48.500
I thought they were
all removed after the battle?

191
00:15:48.541 --> 00:15:50.166
Nymphs.

192
00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:53.416
You are
the forest's armed forces.

193
00:15:53.458 --> 00:15:56.208
Which one of you missed this?

194
00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.916
Good job. Mavka.

195
00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.208
You've embarrassed us
in front of the guardian.

196
00:16:20.666 --> 00:16:22.166
Now. then.

197
00:16:22.208 --> 00:16:25.125
listen. forest-dwellers.

198
00:16:25.166 --> 00:16:28.166
The Supreme Spirits of Nature

199
00:16:28.208 --> 00:16:32.541
whisper that dangerous times
approach.

200
00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:36.208
Therefore. at midnight tonight.

201
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.375
in the heart of the forest.

202
00:16:38.416 --> 00:16:43.500
the spirits shall choose
a new guardian.

203
00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:46.666
Lesh. but what about you?

204
00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:49.625
I have so little strength left.

205
00:16:49.666 --> 00:16:51.625
The guardian's burden

206
00:16:51.666 --> 00:16:54.625
has grown too heavy for me.

207
00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:58.583
Lesh won't be
the guardian anymore?

208
00:16:58.625 --> 00:17:00.583
Will the humans attack us again?

209
00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:04.125
-Who else can protect us?
Hark.

210
00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:08.208
Hush the sky conqueror
can become the guardian.

211
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.583
Guardian chatterbox?

212
00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:13.625
Yeah. just what we need.

213
00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:15.625
I heard that.

214
00:17:15.666 --> 00:17:18.750
But really. anyone
can become the guardian.

215
00:17:18.791 --> 00:17:20.833
You mean like even you?

216
00:17:20.875 --> 00:17:22.583
No. no. no. Mavka.

217
00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:25.708
You may be the sweet.
pure soul of the forest.

218
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.416
but for this job
you are just way too nice.

219
00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:30.791
No. I'm not.

220
00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:33.416
Ooh. I feel unwell.

221
00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:35.000
Ondina. are you alright?

222
00:17:35.041 --> 00:17:38.333
See? So gullible and nice!

223
00:17:39.666 --> 00:17:40.958
Enough!

224
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.291
All will be decided at midnight

225
00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:47.291
in the heart of the forest.

226
00:17:52.416 --> 00:17:54.666
People say that
behind the Dark Mountain.

227
00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:57.750
the water nymphs and tree
spirits can tickle you to death.

228
00:17:57.791 --> 00:18:00.833
Uh. you're laughing and laughing

229
00:18:00.875 --> 00:18:03.083
and then bleugh!

230
00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:06.666
We don't believe in monsters
of the forest.

231
00:18:06.708 --> 00:18:09.375
Where do we go from here?

232
00:18:09.416 --> 00:18:11.875
I think through this way.

233
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.791
Uh...

234
00:18:34.208 --> 00:18:35.500
Uh-huh.

235
00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:37.625
I didn't think we came here
to hunt.

236
00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:40.208
This isn't hunting.

237
00:18:43.458 --> 00:18:46.125
This is fun.

238
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.083
-Yeah.

239
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:57.625
Impossible.

240
00:18:57.666 --> 00:18:59.875
Today of all days.

241
00:19:12.625 --> 00:19:14.583
It was an accident. I tripped.

242
00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:16.958
I am extremely clumsy.

243
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.875
My childhood nickname was
Clumsy Lucas.

244
00:19:19.916 --> 00:19:23.833
We'll make you
Clumsy Black-and-Blue-cus.

245
00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:27.208
Mm-hm.

246
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.083
My brother thinks
you should go on by yourself.

247
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.500
If you find the tree.
mark it on the map.

248
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.375
OK.

249
00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:46.083
I was gonna suggest that anyway.

250
00:20:00.416 --> 00:20:02.125
I feel their fear.

251
00:20:59.166 --> 00:21:00.916
Quiet down.

252
00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:02.750
Everything is fine now.

253
00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:13.291
What scared you so much?

254
00:21:16.791 --> 00:21:18.875
Humans? Here?

255
00:21:18.916 --> 00:21:20.750
I have to tell the nymphs.

256
00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:22.208
Wait.

257
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.916
Come on. Swampy.

258
00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:25.958
I'll deal
with the humans myself.

259
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.750
Let's show them how 'nice' I am.

260
00:21:57.125 --> 00:21:58.791
Argh!

261
00:22:03.833 --> 00:22:06.916
Where in the haunted heck
is this tree?

262
00:22:11.041 --> 00:22:13.291
Believe in yourself. Lucas.

263
00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:15.250
Let the music show you the way.

264
00:22:17.833 --> 00:22:20.166
Whatever that means.

265
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:44.125
Ohh!

266
00:22:49.583 --> 00:22:52.375
It's so beautiful.

267
00:22:52.416 --> 00:22:54.416
Oh. thanks. I...

268
00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:56.125
Uhh...

269
00:22:57.458 --> 00:22:58.916
Argh!

270
00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:01.000
-Argh!

271
00:23:01.041 --> 00:23:03.083
Forest demon!

272
00:23:03.125 --> 00:23:04.333
Argh!

273
00:23:08.708 --> 00:23:10.291
Is the human dead?

274
00:23:34.875 --> 00:23:38.875
Is this some sort
of human magic?

275
00:23:40.416 --> 00:23:42.041
Mavka!

276
00:23:42.083 --> 00:23:43.916
A lot of weird. whistly.
raspy sounds

277
00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:46.416
coming from this exact area
and I...

278
00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:48.416
-Uh. Hush.

279
00:23:48.458 --> 00:23:50.875
You already learned
how to dismount the stork.

280
00:23:50.916 --> 00:23:52.333
Nice.

281
00:23:52.375 --> 00:23:54.458
I am on high alert.

282
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.666
Our forest has just been
incursion-ated by...

283
00:23:57.708 --> 00:24:00.583
Argh! THE HUMANS!

284
00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:02.750
I'll watch him.
You go get the nymphs.

285
00:24:02.791 --> 00:24:03.875
Oh. no.

286
00:24:03.916 --> 00:24:05.625
I say we can drive the human

287
00:24:05.666 --> 00:24:07.375
out of the forest on our own.

288
00:24:07.416 --> 00:24:10.458
So I would be Hush. the first
kicker-outer of humans?

289
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.333
Oh. I like that very much.

290
00:24:12.375 --> 00:24:14.208
-Argh!

291
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.250
Uh... Argh! Evil spirits.

292
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:26.500
Keep back. I'm warning you.

293
00:24:26.541 --> 00:24:30.083
I... I'm a...borscht belt
in combat polka.

294
00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:32.500
Pathetic little human!

295
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:34.041
You violated
our sacred forest...

296
00:24:34.083 --> 00:24:35.291
Huh?!

297
00:24:35.333 --> 00:24:37.833
..and tried to harm
these noble bison.

298
00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:39.875
No! Super no.

299
00:24:39.916 --> 00:24:41.875
That was the bouncer brothers.

300
00:24:41.916 --> 00:24:44.208
In fact. I saved
the bison from them!

301
00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.000
What is this. then?

302
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:47.833
Oh. That's my flute.

303
00:24:47.875 --> 00:24:50.541
I. uh. play my music on it...
with it.

304
00:24:50.583 --> 00:24:52.708
'Music'?

305
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.625
And you were doing this

306
00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:56.583
to try and magically
enchant me in some way?

307
00:24:56.625 --> 00:24:58.791
No! Well. sure.

308
00:24:58.833 --> 00:25:00.791
Music is kind of magic. but...

309
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:03.458
Wait. so you liked it. then?

310
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.916
You do not question me.
little human!

311
00:25:06.958 --> 00:25:08.833
Why have you trespassed here?

312
00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:12.916
A strange lady offered me a big
reward to find a special leaf.

313
00:25:12.958 --> 00:25:15.916
Aha! You hear that? A reward!

314
00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:18.333
I knew that all humans
were selfish and greedy!

315
00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:20.250
-Why you little...

316
00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:22.500
-Ouch.

317
00:25:30.416 --> 00:25:33.750
You see this!
Human treachery!

318
00:25:36.375 --> 00:25:37.875
Huh?

319
00:25:40.666 --> 00:25:42.291
Wow!

320
00:25:42.333 --> 00:25:45.583
You are the most amazingly
beautiful demon

321
00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:48.041
I have ever seen.

322
00:25:48.083 --> 00:25:49.833
Your eyes.

323
00:25:49.875 --> 00:25:51.291
I am not a demon.

324
00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:54.791
I am Mavka.
the soul of the forest.

325
00:25:54.833 --> 00:25:57.125
Well. I'm Lucas.

326
00:25:57.166 --> 00:26:00.166
The soul of...myself?

327
00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:03.375
Look. I can explain.

328
00:26:03.416 --> 00:26:06.416
I need that reward to buy
medicine for my uncle Leo.

329
00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:10.333
No. I have been warned that
humans are skilful liars.

330
00:26:10.375 --> 00:26:14.125
You have broken the law
of the forest and I expel you!

331
00:26:14.166 --> 00:26:17.791
No expulsion necessary.
I'll leave myself.

332
00:26:17.833 --> 00:26:20.333
Just let me find
this silly leaf first

333
00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:23.000
or else my uncle...

334
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:24.041
..dies.

335
00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:27.833
How awful. I'm so sorry.

336
00:26:27.875 --> 00:26:29.041
-Whargh!

337
00:26:29.083 --> 00:26:31.458
Hey there. little...

338
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.041
What are you?

339
00:26:33.083 --> 00:26:35.375
This is Swampy.
the last of the kittyfrogs.

340
00:26:35.416 --> 00:26:37.875
Awww!

341
00:26:37.916 --> 00:26:39.708
It's so cute how much
he hates me.

342
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:40.875
-Oh!

343
00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:42.791
You want something super yummy?

344
00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:50.791
Had a feeling you'd like that.

345
00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:53.750
You're very different
from the evil humans

346
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:56.166
in all the forest legends.

347
00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:35.333
-Huh?

348
00:27:41.416 --> 00:27:42.750
Huh?

349
00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:48.833
Derek. hold my boomstick.

350
00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:50.583
Derek?

351
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.916
Derek? Where are you?

352
00:27:57.916 --> 00:28:00.250
I'll teach you.
you filthy human!

353
00:28:00.291 --> 00:28:01.875
Hush. what are you doing?

354
00:28:01.916 --> 00:28:04.125
Swampy. spit it out immediately!

355
00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:07.541
This grotty fleshbag
is trying to poison you.

356
00:28:07.583 --> 00:28:09.500
Hey! It's my mother's recipe.

357
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:11.750
Oh. Mommy
poisons folks too. huh?

358
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.166
Hush. stop!

359
00:28:17.333 --> 00:28:19.000
Lucas. leave him alone.

360
00:28:19.041 --> 00:28:22.000
-Huh?
-You gave it a name already?

361
00:28:26.083 --> 00:28:28.458
Lucas. Stop it right now!

362
00:28:32.708 --> 00:28:35.875
Well. he started it.
He has to leave.

363
00:28:35.916 --> 00:28:37.416
I need the leaf.

364
00:28:37.458 --> 00:28:39.708
Fine. here's a leaf. Now leave.

365
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.125
Not this one.

366
00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:42.875
Are all humans this picky?

367
00:28:42.916 --> 00:28:45.708
Lucas. It's not the leaves
you really need.

368
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.541
You need to heal your uncle

369
00:28:47.583 --> 00:28:49.875
and I'll give you
the cure he needs.

370
00:28:49.916 --> 00:28:51.166
Really?!

371
00:28:51.208 --> 00:28:53.916
Oh. thank you. You are so nice.

372
00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:55.291
Hey. hey. hey.

373
00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:56.791
Do you really want
to break the law

374
00:28:56.833 --> 00:28:59.333
to help a human on such a day?

375
00:28:59.375 --> 00:29:01.041
You heard him.

376
00:29:01.083 --> 00:29:02.875
He saved the bison.

377
00:29:02.916 --> 00:29:06.416
and for some reason...
I believe him.

378
00:29:06.458 --> 00:29:08.250
-Urgh!

379
00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:11.625
After all.
the soul of the forest

380
00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:14.583
must help all the living
creatures in the forest. right?

381
00:29:14.625 --> 00:29:17.250
And Lucas is a living creature
who is in the forest.

382
00:29:17.291 --> 00:29:19.000
-Huh?
-Therefore. I have to help him.

383
00:29:19.041 --> 00:29:21.625
And you will help me help him.

384
00:29:21.666 --> 00:29:23.083
Me?

385
00:29:23.125 --> 00:29:24.500
No way! Never!

386
00:29:24.541 --> 00:29:26.583
Never. never. never. never.
never. never. never!

387
00:29:26.625 --> 00:29:28.541
-No!

388
00:29:28.583 --> 00:29:33.291
When will I learn that I'm
incapable of saying no to you?

389
00:29:33.333 --> 00:29:37.500
Don't worry. Hush. We'll make it
before the ceremony starts.

390
00:29:37.541 --> 00:29:40.208
I'll give Lucas the cure
for his uncle and...

391
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.625
And then he'll leave
the forest forever.

392
00:29:42.666 --> 00:29:44.583
I promise.

393
00:29:47.583 --> 00:29:49.000
Hmm?

394
00:29:49.041 --> 00:29:51.791
Come to me!

395
00:29:51.833 --> 00:29:56.250
Don't be shy. Come closer.

396
00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:58.083
Ahhh!

397
00:30:12.291 --> 00:30:13.500
Huh?

398
00:30:15.291 --> 00:30:16.791
Argh!

399
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.875
How did I...

400
00:30:22.916 --> 00:30:24.541
Curses!

401
00:30:29.708 --> 00:30:31.125
-Uh...

402
00:30:31.166 --> 00:30:32.500
Oh.

403
00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:35.458
Mm.

404
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.041
Huh?

405
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:45.208
Mavka. how can I thank you
for your help?

406
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.083
Just tell me and I'll do it
with pleasure.

407
00:30:48.125 --> 00:30:51.500
Maybe you could play
your music for me?

408
00:30:51.541 --> 00:30:53.250
Oh. Sure thing.

409
00:30:54.708 --> 00:30:56.708
No. no. no. not now.

410
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.000
Nobody can know you're here.

411
00:30:58.041 --> 00:30:59.958
No. let him play.

412
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.833
The nymphs will hide him
safely in the forest.

413
00:31:02.875 --> 00:31:05.958

actually as terrible
as you've been taught.

449
00:33:00.541 --> 00:33:03.125
We have a lot of nice things.

450
00:33:03.166 --> 00:33:06.291
Like music. It's so lovely.

451
00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:09.541
You must be the guardian
of music in your world.

452
00:33:09.583 --> 00:33:11.416
Not yet.

453
00:33:11.458 --> 00:33:14.833
But my dream is to fill
my whole life with music.

454
00:33:14.875 --> 00:33:17.083
As soon as my uncle gets better.

455
00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:20.250
my musician friends and I are
leaving for the big city.

456
00:33:20.291 --> 00:33:22.583
"The big city".

457
00:33:22.625 --> 00:33:25.416
What is the big city?

458
00:33:25.458 --> 00:33:29.708
It's a place where everything
is made of bricks and stone

459
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.416
and there are as many buildings

460
00:33:31.458 --> 00:33:32.875
as there are trees
in the forest...

461
00:33:32.916 --> 00:33:34.708
Hurry up. hurry up. Move!

462
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.708
What are you doing?
Back off. shrubby.

463
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.000
Hush! Mavka!

464
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:43.500
Are you the ones
making all this noise?

465
00:33:43.541 --> 00:33:45.416
Too late.

466
00:33:45.458 --> 00:33:46.791
Nice knowing you. Mavka.

467
00:33:46.833 --> 00:33:49.708
Up until today. anyway.

468
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.916
Lesh. how's it going?

469
00:33:51.958 --> 00:33:54.250
Busier than I'd like.

470
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:57.166
Who is your guest?

471
00:33:57.208 --> 00:34:01.083
Uh. I'm...Hush's...cousin.

472
00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:03.875
Yes. dropped by
for a visit from overseas.

473
00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:06.083
Right. Hush?

474
00:34:07.458 --> 00:34:09.875
Uh-huh.

475
00:34:09.916 --> 00:34:13.666
A very. very
many-times-removed cousin.

476
00:34:13.708 --> 00:34:17.041
Shmucas is his name.

477
00:34:17.083 --> 00:34:20.500
Ah! Welcome. friend Shmucas.

478
00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:24.791
Come quickly.
The ceremony is about to begin.

479
00:34:27.583 --> 00:34:30.125
Oh. great. What do we do now?

480
00:34:30.166 --> 00:34:33.041
Do you realise how illegal
this is?

481
00:34:33.083 --> 00:34:36.458
We just need to keep our
distance from the new guardian.

482
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.250
As soon as the ceremony is over.
I'll come up with something.

483
00:34:46.291 --> 00:34:48.583
You look just like
your parents. madam.

484
00:34:51.916 --> 00:34:54.708
Hm. much better now.

485
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.041
Yeah. Lovely portrait.

486
00:34:57.083 --> 00:34:58.958
Totally...horridness.

487
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.041
Hmm?

488
00:35:07.125 --> 00:35:09.166
Hmm. Did you find the tree?

489
00:35:12.833 --> 00:35:14.583
So what stopped you?

490
00:35:14.625 --> 00:35:17.791
Bunnies? Squirrels?
The forest demons?

491
00:35:20.833 --> 00:35:22.583
Knuckleheads.

492
00:35:22.625 --> 00:35:25.833
Totally useless. Oh!

493
00:35:25.875 --> 00:35:28.041
Stop being such fools.

494
00:35:28.083 --> 00:35:29.958
You are stupid idiots.

495
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.791
What am I paying you for?

496
00:35:31.833 --> 00:35:34.833
And where is the boy?

497
00:35:37.166 --> 00:35:38.416
Oh!

498
00:35:39.916 --> 00:35:41.458
-Out of my way.

499
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.500
Oh!

500
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.916
Oh. damn!

501
00:36:18.125 --> 00:36:19.833
I'm running out of time.

502
00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:28.791
And where is this peasant loser?

503
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.750
Ohhh! Oh!

504
00:37:05.125 --> 00:37:07.166
-Hey.

505
00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:08.541
Shhh!

506
00:37:14.125 --> 00:37:15.708
It is time.

507
00:37:16.958 --> 00:37:18.000
Hmm!

508
00:37:24.083 --> 00:37:26.250
Oh! That's the...

509
00:37:26.291 --> 00:37:29.583
The Supreme Spirits of Nature.

510
00:37:29.625 --> 00:37:32.833
I summon you.

511
00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:36.250
The One Who Dwells in the Earth.

512
00:37:36.291 --> 00:37:38.750
I call on you.

513
00:37:43.916 --> 00:37:47.541
The One Who Moves the Waters.

514
00:37:47.583 --> 00:37:50.875
I call on you.

515
00:37:54.916 --> 00:37:57.958
The One Who Flies
with the Wind...

516
00:38:00.958 --> 00:38:03.541
..the One Who Sits
on the Rock...

517
00:38:03.583 --> 00:38:06.666
..I call on you.

518
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.625
Those who protect us.

519
00:38:11.666 --> 00:38:13.916
those who help us.

520
00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:17.291
those who dwell
at the Source of Life.

521
00:38:17.333 --> 00:38:21.916
please choose the new guardian.

522
00:38:53.916 --> 00:38:55.416
Mm.

523
00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:56.625
Hmm?

524
00:38:59.208 --> 00:39:01.916
The guardian is chosen.

525
00:39:01.958 --> 00:39:03.250
Huh?

526
00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:05.041
-Her?
-Me?

527
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.125
What's happening?
Is it good or bad?

528
00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:13.500
Please close the knothole
on the front of your face.

529
00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:15.916
Lesh. why me?

530
00:39:15.958 --> 00:39:18.333
I can't possibly be
the guardian.

531
00:39:18.375 --> 00:39:20.208
I have to tell you something.

532
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:23.333
The Supreme Spirits are wise.

533
00:39:23.375 --> 00:39:28.375
and they know who is capable
of protecting our realm.

534
00:39:28.416 --> 00:39:31.208
Now the Supreme Spirits

535
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.791
will bestow their powers
on the chosen one.

536
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:04.041
-Incredible.
-Perfect.

537
00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:08.541
So how do we "keep our distance
from the new guardian" now?

538
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:14.291
Mavka. you are now granted

539
00:41:14.333 --> 00:41:18.875
the powers of
the Supreme Spirits of Nature.

540
00:41:18.916 --> 00:41:20.791
It is for you now

541
00:41:20.833 --> 00:41:24.166
to always remember
that our enemy -

542
00:41:24.208 --> 00:41:27.750
the humans - are out there.

543
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:31.416
Defend this fragile.
sacred place

544
00:41:31.458 --> 00:41:33.583
with your very life.

545
00:41:33.625 --> 00:41:38.041
Please welcome our new guardian

546
00:41:38.083 --> 00:41:41.375
of the Source of Life
and the forest.

547
00:41:51.875 --> 00:41:54.875
That was just...whoa!

548
00:41:54.916 --> 00:41:57.875
Our little Mavka
is now the guardian.

549
00:41:57.916 --> 00:42:01.083
I always knew this would happen.

550
00:42:02.708 --> 00:42:05.000
There has got
to be some mistake.

551
00:42:05.041 --> 00:42:07.708
Why did the spirits not choose
the strongest one?

552
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:09.541
With her as guardian.

553
00:42:09.583 --> 00:42:12.250
our forest is more in danger
than ever.

554
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:14.375
Hey. Easy there. friend.

555
00:42:14.416 --> 00:42:17.000
Who are you supposed to be?

556
00:42:17.041 --> 00:42:19.583
Me? I am. uh. Hush's cousin.

557
00:42:19.625 --> 00:42:21.583
You...

558
00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:24.291
You stink like a human.

559
00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:28.416
Yeah. he stepped in some human
on the way here.

560
00:42:28.458 --> 00:42:30.666
Uh. Cousin Shmucas.

561
00:42:30.708 --> 00:42:32.833
If he's a noise keeper.

562
00:42:32.875 --> 00:42:35.208
I'm the new guardian
of the forest.

563
00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:36.500
And we all know...

564
00:42:36.541 --> 00:42:38.333
-..I'm not.

565
00:42:39.708 --> 00:42:41.625
-Uh...oops.

566
00:42:41.666 --> 00:42:44.041
Human?!

567
00:42:44.083 --> 00:42:46.750
Run. Move your footsticks.

568
00:42:46.791 --> 00:42:50.916
You treacherous human.
You have tricked me!

569
00:42:50.958 --> 00:42:53.083
-Human?
-Oh. no. he's a human.

570
00:42:58.041 --> 00:42:59.791
Don't let him get away!

571
00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:02.541
Am I the only one here
who's completely confused?

572
00:43:02.583 --> 00:43:04.291
Hush!

573
00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:09.333
You've got a great deal
of explaining to do.

574
00:43:15.458 --> 00:43:17.416
Argh!

575
00:43:20.083 --> 00:43:22.166
-Huh?

576
00:43:22.208 --> 00:43:23.541
Argh!

577
00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:45.791
Argh!

578
00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:59.041
Argh!

579
00:44:05.125 --> 00:44:06.958
Argh!

580
00:44:13.666 --> 00:44:16.166
-Mavka.
-Get on. quick.

581
00:44:16.208 --> 00:44:17.541
The lynx will take you home.

582
00:44:17.583 --> 00:44:20.583
Whoa! Sounds safe.

583
00:44:20.625 --> 00:44:22.416
Nice...kitty.

584
00:44:22.458 --> 00:44:23.791
Take this.

585
00:44:23.833 --> 00:44:26.041
It will heal your uncle.

586
00:44:28.375 --> 00:44:30.000
Thank you.

587
00:44:30.041 --> 00:44:31.708
-Huh?

588
00:44:33.166 --> 00:44:35.666
There's no time.
Go...and never return.

589
00:44:35.708 --> 00:44:38.083
Death is the only thing
for a human to seek here.

590
00:44:38.125 --> 00:44:40.500
-Go!
-Wait!

591
00:44:40.541 --> 00:44:42.083
I promised I'd play for you.

592
00:44:43.625 --> 00:44:46.291
Where is he? Where's the human?

593
00:44:46.333 --> 00:44:47.916
He got away.

594
00:44:49.166 --> 00:44:50.833
What? How did he...

595
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.750
You helped him?

596
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:56.000
You have the powers
of the guardian

597
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:58.000
at your disposal.
you could have -

598
00:44:58.041 --> 00:45:01.375
no. you should have -
stopped him.

599
00:45:01.416 --> 00:45:03.666
The guardian
doesn't need your help

600
00:45:03.708 --> 00:45:06.625
deciding how and when
to use her powers. Ondina.

601
00:45:06.666 --> 00:45:08.333
Mavka.

602
00:45:08.375 --> 00:45:11.375
this human is no different
than all the others.

603
00:45:11.416 --> 00:45:13.208
He will betray you.

604
00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:17.666
And when he does.
we will all pay the price.

605
00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:38.791
Hmm.

606
00:45:47.916 --> 00:45:49.250
Frol!

607
00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:51.416
Yes. madam?

608
00:45:51.458 --> 00:45:54.833
There's something
about this boy Lucas

609
00:45:54.875 --> 00:45:57.125
I don't trust.

610
00:45:57.166 --> 00:45:58.500
Watch him.

611
00:45:58.541 --> 00:46:00.125
I'm not so sure

612
00:46:00.166 --> 00:46:03.125
he came back from the forest
empty-handed.

613
00:46:03.166 --> 00:46:04.375
Me?!

614
00:46:04.416 --> 00:46:07.541
Madam. I am a fashion tsar
in the making.

615
00:46:07.583 --> 00:46:09.458
not a spy.

616
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.875
Oh. that's too bad.

617
00:46:11.916 --> 00:46:15.083
If I get what I want.
I could establish you

618
00:46:15.125 --> 00:46:17.666
as the number one fashion god...

619
00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:19.625
..in the world.

620
00:46:19.666 --> 00:46:24.333
With my own Soul of Frol
Manly Lace Boutique?

621
00:46:24.375 --> 00:46:26.416
With a global chain

622
00:46:26.458 --> 00:46:29.708
of whatever insane thing
you just said.

623
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.708
Then. if you need a spy.

624
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.208
why. Frol is your guy.

625
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:47.208
Ugh. Uh!

626
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:51.750
Silks. ribbons and laces
don't have to be disgraces.

627
00:46:51.791 --> 00:46:53.666
That's the Soul of Frol.

628
00:46:56.208 --> 00:46:59.916
No. This really happened to me.
Last night.

629
00:46:59.958 --> 00:47:04.125
The forest is full of -
not demons - but creatures.

630
00:47:04.166 --> 00:47:06.666
And they are
not fond of us at all.

631
00:47:08.833 --> 00:47:12.208
Except Mavka. She is very nice.

632
00:47:17.291 --> 00:47:19.833
Danger or no.
I have to go back to the forest

633
00:47:19.875 --> 00:47:22.250
to Mavka. to thank her.

634
00:47:22.291 --> 00:47:26.416
Lucas. look. if you've been at
the village fair all night long

635
00:47:26.458 --> 00:47:30.541
and plan on going back.
you can just tell me.

636
00:47:30.583 --> 00:47:32.416
Busted. You know me.

637
00:47:32.458 --> 00:47:34.541
Party animal.

638
00:47:34.583 --> 00:47:36.708
Best carnival ever.

639
00:47:47.833 --> 00:47:49.541
Mmm!

640
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.458
So how is this.

641
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.416
uh. perdi-caca-something-um

642
00:48:04.458 --> 00:48:06.208
supposed to work?

643
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.416
I have less than no idea.

644
00:48:10.916 --> 00:48:13.291
-Huh?

645
00:48:20.208 --> 00:48:22.000
Uncle?

646
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.750
Whoa!

647
00:48:26.791 --> 00:48:29.125
Hah! And no pain.

648
00:48:29.166 --> 00:48:31.916
I haven't stood this straight
in 20 years.

649
00:48:31.958 --> 00:48:34.833
It's a miracle.

650
00:48:38.083 --> 00:48:39.708
It is a miracle.

651
00:48:41.916 --> 00:48:44.625
It's a miracle
of perdi-caca-something-um.

652
00:48:44.666 --> 00:48:47.083
I've got so much energy.

653
00:48:47.125 --> 00:48:49.708
Now I'll be Hercu-Leo.

654
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:51.750
Hey. let's take up curling.

655
00:49:27.166 --> 00:49:30.041
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

656
00:49:33.958 --> 00:49:37.041
Yeah. it's bit more
complicated now.

657
00:49:37.083 --> 00:49:40.583
But. Swampy. think for yourself.

658
00:49:40.625 --> 00:49:44.083
How can he play his beautiful
music without his flute?

659
00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:48.958
We have to return this to Lucas.

660
00:49:53.375 --> 00:49:56.541
What if something happens
in the forest while I'm gone?

661
00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:00.708
What if nothing happens
while I'm here?

662
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.583
You're absolutely right.

663
00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:05.708
I'm the guardian now.
I can't leave the forest.

664
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:07.916
Humans are enemies.

665
00:50:07.958 --> 00:50:10.708
I somehow managed to live
without Lucas before.

666
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:12.541
Or his music.

667
00:50:12.583 --> 00:50:14.125
Or his eyes.

668
00:50:14.166 --> 00:50:15.500
Or his smile.

669
00:50:15.541 --> 00:50:17.541
Or this feeling

670
00:50:17.583 --> 00:50:19.666
that now lives right here.

671
00:50:36.625 --> 00:50:40.791
Hmm. Mmm.

672
00:50:40.833 --> 00:50:44.166
Madam! Madam! Where's Madam?

673
00:50:54.916 --> 00:50:58.750
Madam
is probably upstairs.

674
00:50:58.791 --> 00:51:00.500
-Gah!

675
00:51:04.333 --> 00:51:06.000
Madam! Madam!

676
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:10.166
Madam. you were right!

677
00:51:12.166 --> 00:51:13.583
Eugh!

678
00:51:15.458 --> 00:51:17.333
That icky boy lied to you!

679
00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:19.541
Here.

680
00:51:23.708 --> 00:51:26.083
Oh.

681
00:51:26.125 --> 00:51:28.625
Lucas was at the Source of Life.

682
00:51:29.958 --> 00:51:32.833
The heart of the forest.

683
00:51:32.875 --> 00:51:36.916
And I also found this.

684
00:51:37.916 --> 00:51:41.125
Finally it will be mine!

685
00:51:42.583 --> 00:51:45.416
But...but there is nothing
marked here!

686
00:51:45.458 --> 00:51:49.166
Now think! Did Lucas
say anything about the tree?

687
00:51:49.208 --> 00:51:50.541
No!

688
00:51:50.583 --> 00:51:52.333
Nothing about the tree.

689
00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:55.750
but he just said
he will go into the forest again

690
00:51:55.791 --> 00:51:57.458
to see the nice forest.

691
00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.000
The magma! Boy. what a fool.

692
00:52:00.041 --> 00:52:02.208
It doesn't make sense.

693
00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:04.000
The nice forest magma?

694
00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:06.625
Yeah. that's what he said.

695
00:52:06.666 --> 00:52:10.291
He probably wants to keep
the source to himself.

696
00:52:10.333 --> 00:52:12.708
-Frol.
-Yes. Madam?

697
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:15.208
-Keep an eye on this boy.

698
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:17.916
When he decides to go
to the forest.

699
00:52:17.958 --> 00:52:20.916
we need to keep him company
by all means.

700
00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:32.625
But on the other hand.
as the guardian.

701
00:52:32.666 --> 00:52:36.375
shouldn't I learn as much
about our enemies as I can?

702
00:52:36.416 --> 00:52:40.333
If Lucas isn't evil. maybe other
humans aren't evil either.

703
00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:45.083
Oh. stop croaking about
the law of the forest!

704
00:52:45.125 --> 00:52:47.291
Maybe it's time
for things to change

705
00:52:47.333 --> 00:52:51.208
so that the forest-dwellers
and humans could live in peace.

706
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:52.333
Oh!

707
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:11.750
Uhh. no! I can't show up
looking like this.

708
00:53:11.791 --> 00:53:13.875
-Hm!

709
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:17.166
Huh?

710
00:53:17.208 --> 00:53:20.208
Gotta find something
a human would wear.

711
00:53:58.916 --> 00:54:01.791
Hey. boy. I'm making a gift.

712
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:07.500
Yes. Dot.
Mavka is going to love me.

713
00:54:07.541 --> 00:54:09.875
Uh. it! It.

714
00:54:15.416 --> 00:54:18.083
And...done.

715
00:54:25.208 --> 00:54:27.375
-Hey. where are the pies?!

716
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:30.875
Pie-demolisher!

717
00:54:30.916 --> 00:54:32.791
-It's fine.

718
00:54:32.833 --> 00:54:34.708
I'm not perfect either.

719
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:37.291
For instance. I'm about to
break my promise to Hush

720
00:54:37.333 --> 00:54:38.916
and the forest law

721
00:54:38.958 --> 00:54:41.250
in order to keep
my promise to Mavka.

722
00:54:47.416 --> 00:54:49.583
Mavka. are you here?

723
00:54:49.625 --> 00:54:52.791
Your hair! How are you here?

724
00:54:52.833 --> 00:54:54.833
Aren't you happy to see me?

725
00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:57.000
No. I mean. yes!

726
00:54:57.041 --> 00:54:59.458
Heart-burstingly happy.

727
00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.416
which is a thing I probably
shouldn't say out loud.

728
00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:06.541
Oh. is this your nest?

729
00:55:06.583 --> 00:55:10.875
I prefer
to think of it as a cave.

730
00:55:12.125 --> 00:55:14.791
Is this for making music too?

731
00:55:16.666 --> 00:55:18.500
-Uh. no.

732
00:55:18.541 --> 00:55:23.000
Those are regular instruments.
not musical instruments.

733
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:24.708
I've come to return your flute.

734
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.000
It was broken. but I...

735
00:55:27.041 --> 00:55:29.000
Here.

736
00:55:32.583 --> 00:55:33.958
Thank you.

737
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:46.458
Now you can go to the stone
forest and follow your dream.

738
00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.750
Just play for me one last time
and then I'll leave.

739
00:55:49.791 --> 00:55:52.250
No. No. don't leave!

740
00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:54.083
Uh. I have an idea.

741
00:55:54.125 --> 00:55:56.333
I'll play even better music
for you.

742
00:55:56.375 --> 00:55:59.166
There's a festival in town and
my band is playing. Let's go!

743
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.166
-Uh...
- Don't be afraid.

744
00:56:05.208 --> 00:56:07.000
It'll be good
for guardian of the forest

745
00:56:07.041 --> 00:56:08.708
to know more about us humans.
right?

746
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:10.583
Uh...

747
00:56:12.083 --> 00:56:14.583
-You're gonna love it.

748
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.708
Huh?

749
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:44.500
Mavka. let's find you
an outfit that says.

750
00:56:44.541 --> 00:56:47.041
"I am a non-alarming
local human."

751
00:56:47.083 --> 00:56:48.750
What's wrong with this one?

752
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:51.125
Well. it kind of screams.

753
00:56:51.166 --> 00:56:53.833
"Howdy. I'm a barely disguised
forest demon

754
00:56:53.875 --> 00:56:55.416
"from behind the Dark Mountain."

755
00:56:57.083 --> 00:56:58.500
Oh!

756
00:57:27.083 --> 00:57:28.541
Oh.

757
00:57:31.708 --> 00:57:33.083
-Oh!

758
00:57:34.166 --> 00:57:36.916
-Hm?

759
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:49.916
-And this is my uncle Leo.
-Oh!

760
00:57:49.958 --> 00:57:52.125
He's the one you saved
with your gift.

761
00:58:04.583 --> 00:58:06.333
Hm?

762
00:58:07.833 --> 00:58:09.750
What have you done?

763
00:58:11.458 --> 00:58:14.333
Oh! Those are
my friends playing.

764
00:59:00.875 --> 00:59:05.208
This music. the dancing -
how delightful!

765
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:08.000
But you still play better
than anybody else.

766
00:59:08.041 --> 00:59:10.083
He was born that way!

767
00:59:10.125 --> 00:59:13.041
So. Lucas.
Uncle Leo is recovered.

768
00:59:13.083 --> 00:59:14.833
He looks better than you now.

769
00:59:14.875 --> 00:59:17.833
Isn't it time to show
your talent to the big city?

770
00:59:17.875 --> 00:59:20.541
Um. well...

771
00:59:20.583 --> 00:59:24.333
Or has the music shown you
a different way?

772
00:59:24.375 --> 00:59:27.333
A very beautiful way.

773
00:59:27.375 --> 00:59:30.208
Well. your call. Romeo.

774
00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:32.416
We're always happy
to have you with us.

775
00:59:32.458 --> 00:59:34.541
Pack up. We gotta go.

776
00:59:34.583 --> 00:59:37.875
Oh. that's right. it's late.
I must go too.

777
00:59:37.916 --> 00:59:41.666
Thank you for the wonderful time
and for the gift.

778
00:59:41.708 --> 00:59:45.500
Wait! I haven't fulfilled
my promise yet.

779
01:00:05.416 --> 01:00:10.208
-Look! A demon from the forest!

780
01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:15.375
-She's glowing!
-Green hair!

781
01:00:15.416 --> 01:00:18.666
An evil spirit from behind
the Dark Mountain!

782
01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:20.166
What shall we do?

783
01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:22.833
She's come to kill
our lovey ones

784
01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:25.625
and destroy our food crops!

785
01:00:25.666 --> 01:00:28.250
No! It's not true!

786
01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.708
This lad is trying
to protect the demon.

787
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.291
She has bewitched him.

788
01:00:32.333 --> 01:00:34.500
-She'll put a curse on us.

789
01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:36.000
Get her!

790
01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:38.750
No! She won't hurt anyone.

791
01:00:47.666 --> 01:00:49.166
-Lucas!

792
01:00:49.208 --> 01:00:50.625
No!

793
01:00:50.666 --> 01:00:52.333
- Hm...
-Argh!

794
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.583
Let me go! Lucas!

795
01:01:08.625 --> 01:01:10.833
What do we do?

796
01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.458
-Burn her. right?
-No. they drown witches!

797
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.083
Let's do both!

798
01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:18.541
My fellow villagers.
I was wrong.

799
01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:22.750
The evil spirits of the forest
are very real.

800
01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:27.583
And now I see that it was her
kind that burned up my father.

801
01:01:27.625 --> 01:01:30.666
the goodly sawmill owner.

802
01:01:30.708 --> 01:01:32.541
How dare she!

803
01:01:32.583 --> 01:01:33.875
But fear not!

804
01:01:33.916 --> 01:01:36.208
My eyes are open now

805
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:39.791
and I will find out what
the demons have in store for us.

806
01:01:39.833 --> 01:01:41.333
be it plague...

807
01:01:41.375 --> 01:01:42.791
-..drought...

808
01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:47.208
-..famine. fire or flood!

809
01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:50.208
And where the Source of Life is.

810
01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:55.458
-Oh!

811
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.458
-What is this?!

812
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.291
-What's happening?
-Black magic!

813
01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:10.000
-Argh!

814
01:02:17.666 --> 01:02:18.750
Don't let her get away!

815
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:32.625
-Lesh!

816
01:02:45.833 --> 01:02:47.958
Where'd he go?
Is he gone?

817
01:02:49.458 --> 01:02:51.375
All is lost!

818
01:02:51.416 --> 01:02:56.166
My strong silks. my robust
ribbons. my manly laces.

819
01:02:56.208 --> 01:02:59.583
the Soul of Frol - gone!

820
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:06.625
Oh!

821
01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:11.833
It isn't over yet.
my whiny little pet.

822
01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:18.458
My poor. dear.
terrified fellow villagers.

823
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.333
we underestimated
the demon's power

824
01:03:21.375 --> 01:03:24.041
and the results were tragic.

825
01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:28.541
But this is not the end.

826
01:03:28.583 --> 01:03:30.166
They'll soon be back!

827
01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:33.333
-Oh. no! What do we do?
-Oh. this is terrible!

828
01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:37.083
There's only one way
to stop this evil.

829
01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:38.833
Strike first!

830
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.791
Lesh.
how did you find me?

831
01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:52.416
Hush told me everything.

832
01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:55.416
I don't understand what's
happening. Those humans...

833
01:03:55.458 --> 01:03:57.291
Calm down now.

834
01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.708
Those humans obviously conspired

835
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:03.458
to lure you into a trap.

836
01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:08.708
I love how no matter where you
look. you see goodness. Mavka.

837
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:13.625
but you have made
the same mistake I made once

838
01:04:13.666 --> 01:04:16.500
in trusting a human.

839
01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:18.375
Lucas would never do that.

840
01:04:18.416 --> 01:04:20.791
I'm sure
he can explain everything.

841
01:04:28.875 --> 01:04:30.333
-Mavka!?

842
01:04:42.125 --> 01:04:45.041
Now. Lucas.

843
01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:47.708
be a good boy of limited
intellect and integrity

844
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:51.458
and mark the Source of Life
on this crudely drawn map.

845
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.875
Never gonna happen. lady.

846
01:04:58.916 --> 01:05:02.125
Somebody found a backbone!

847
01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:05.541
Let's see if we can't just
melt it like meringue.

848
01:05:05.583 --> 01:05:07.625
Ooh. I'm peckish.

849
01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:11.166
Oh. no!

850
01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.583
Don't touch her!

851
01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:24.458
The source...

852
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.541
-..or she dies.

853
01:05:35.958 --> 01:05:37.750
Now let Mavka go!

854
01:05:37.791 --> 01:05:40.958
Sure thing. ding-a-ling.

855
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.875
Oh. Lucas!
Smooch. smooch. swoon!

856
01:05:44.916 --> 01:05:47.833
Oh. you saved me! You saved me!

857
01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:51.750
You're so. so dumb.

858
01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:55.583
No! Kylina. you won't
get away with this!

859
01:05:55.625 --> 01:05:58.375
-Ah! Ah!

860
01:05:58.416 --> 01:06:02.416
Really?
Guess I'll just stop. then.

861
01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:05.041
Have a nice swim. sweetie!

862
01:06:13.208 --> 01:06:19.125
So much water has flowed past
since that fateful day.

863
01:06:19.166 --> 01:06:23.416
the time has come for me
to tell the full truth.

864
01:06:23.458 --> 01:06:28.458
The battle
all those winters ago -

865
01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:32.791
I've never told anyone
the reason why it happened.

866
01:06:35.875 --> 01:06:39.333
The sawmill owner
came to me in tears.

867
01:06:39.375 --> 01:06:43.250
He was begging me to save
his newborn daughter...

868
01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:47.958
..and I believed in goodness
in him.

869
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:52.083
I gave this human

870
01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:55.708
a drop from
the Source of Life itself.

871
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:59.000
Soon. he returned with...

872
01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:02.166
..well. with an army of humans.

873
01:07:02.208 --> 01:07:06.208
They wanted the Source of Life
for themselves.

874
01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:12.416
So. I called for the Supreme
Spirit of the Underworld.

875
01:07:12.458 --> 01:07:17.166
the One Who Sits in the Rock.
to give me the Spark of Rage.

876
01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:23.166
And. may all those I love
forgive me.

877
01:07:23.208 --> 01:07:25.708
he did.

878
01:07:27.208 --> 01:07:32.291
Everything good in me
was replaced by sheer rage.

879
01:07:32.333 --> 01:07:36.958
I burned and the world burned.

880
01:07:43.791 --> 01:07:46.791
Humans and the forest alike.

881
01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:52.666
Fire and hatred without end.

882
01:08:04.666 --> 01:08:06.625
Have you seen Lucas?

883
01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:09.208
Have you seen my boy. Lucas?

884
01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:10.541
Oh!

885
01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:14.041
Your boy's been taken by
the evil forest demons.

886
01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:17.458
-Huh?
-Stings. right?

887
01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:22.083
But you can still save him
if you join us.

888
01:08:22.125 --> 01:08:25.333
Take the weapon. old man.
I'm on a schedule here!

889
01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:29.291
You stay here and make sure
nobody finds the boy...

890
01:08:29.333 --> 01:08:32.833
..unless you were just dying
to be in the battle?

891
01:08:34.666 --> 01:08:38.875
This is for our home!

892
01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:40.833
And my youthful skin.

893
01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:44.208
Now let's go
eradicate those demons

894
01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:47.000
for the good of
all we hold dear!

895
01:08:47.041 --> 01:08:51.083
-Yes!
-Yes! Death to the demons!

896
01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:53.916
Start the forest killer!

897
01:09:24.125 --> 01:09:28.208
Humans are preparing
to attack the forest.

898
01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.708
Uh!

899
01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:37.333
Hey! Somebody! Anybody! Hey!

900
01:09:53.791 --> 01:09:56.208
Dot? Dot. is that you?

901
01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.541
Good boy!

902
01:09:59.583 --> 01:10:02.250
Run! Find someone to help me!
Hurry!

903
01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:15.833
So. that's it. War is here.

904
01:10:17.375 --> 01:10:19.916
The sawmill owner's daughter...

905
01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:21.916
I know what to do!

906
01:10:21.958 --> 01:10:25.166
What? Decorate their axes
with flowers?

907
01:10:25.208 --> 01:10:28.333
I know what we all need to do -
fight!

908
01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:30.625
No! There's another way!

909
01:10:30.666 --> 01:10:35.083
I am the guardian
and this is my call. Wait here.

910
01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:39.666
-Don't look at me.

911
01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:42.583
She is the guardian.

912
01:11:15.375 --> 01:11:17.500
What's going on?

913
01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:23.666
Whoa!

914
01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:36.041
Please stop!

915
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:38.333
Hm.

916
01:11:40.708 --> 01:11:43.041
I might've frightened
the people at the fair.

917
01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:45.958
but the forest means no harm
to humans.

918
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.708
We can live in peace
and even help each other.

919
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:52.041
"Help each other"?

920
01:11:52.083 --> 01:11:55.250
A long time ago.
the forest gave a drop

921
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:57.750
from the Source of Life
to the owner of the sawmill

922
01:11:57.791 --> 01:12:00.583
so he could heal
his sick newborn daughter.

923
01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:03.125
The forest saved you!

924
01:12:03.166 --> 01:12:06.416
What? Nobody ever told me!

925
01:12:06.458 --> 01:12:09.208
It is the truth.

926
01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:12.083
The truth?

927
01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:18.250
The truth is the sawmill owner
never had a daughter.

928
01:12:18.291 --> 01:12:22.291
but he had a beautiful wife that
came up with a tragic story

929
01:12:22.333 --> 01:12:25.125
about a little sick daughter.

930
01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:27.916
My husband was obedient
but weak.

931
01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:30.458
He only got me
the one lousy drop

932
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.958
that kept me young and fit
for all these years.

933
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.125
But how does this
make us enemies?

934
01:12:36.166 --> 01:12:39.333
Oh. you'll never
understand this. Look at you!

935
01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:43.958
You're Nature's queen.
glowing and gorgeous forever!

936
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.041
You don't know nothing about
crow's-feet. turkey neck.

937
01:12:47.083 --> 01:12:48.875
back fat.

938
01:12:48.916 --> 01:12:52.583
You'll never get old
and saggy and shrivelled.

939
01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:54.666
But I can give you
one more drop.

940
01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:57.708
That is so nice of you.

941
01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:03.333
but. see. if I get hold of
the entire Source of Life.

942
01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:07.250
I will not only be young
and beautiful forever.

943
01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:09.083
but it'll also make me

944
01:13:09.125 --> 01:13:13.208
the richest.
most powerful woman ever.

945
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:16.166
But without the Source of Life.
the forest will die.

946
01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:18.375
It's gonna die
one way or the other. honey.

947
01:13:18.416 --> 01:13:20.666
so why not just
get out of my way?

948
01:13:20.708 --> 01:13:22.541
Hm.

949
01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:29.833
Not all humans are
as cruel and selfish as you are!

950
01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:35.458
Oh. you're thinking about
that lad of yours? Lucas?

951
01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.500
Huh?

952
01:13:42.666 --> 01:13:44.583
Do you have any idea
where he is?

953
01:13:46.958 --> 01:13:49.083
I...

954
01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:51.875
I'll tell you another truth.
sister.

955
01:13:51.916 --> 01:13:55.666
I paid Lucas very well
so he would find the source

956
01:13:55.708 --> 01:13:57.833
and lure you into the village.

957
01:13:57.875 --> 01:14:02.333
-Huh?
-He took his money and left.

958
01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:10.708
To the city?

959
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.208
Exactly.

960
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:14.625
Oh.

961
01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:19.833
And one more thing.

962
01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:23.625
Lucas told me it was
almost too easy to fool you

963
01:14:23.666 --> 01:14:27.041
because you're just so nice.

964
01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:28.833
Oh.

965
01:14:30.625 --> 01:14:33.291
Now get out of my way

966
01:14:33.333 --> 01:14:36.291
and take your
freaky woodland zoo with you!

967
01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:49.375
Mavka! I knew we couldn't
trust that Shmucas!

968
01:14:49.416 --> 01:14:52.333
I got it so wrong. Hush.

969
01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:55.750
Humans really are all evil.
Lucas is...

970
01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:58.041
Huh! Huh!

971
01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:04.375
Who are you. friend?

972
01:16:06.166 --> 01:16:08.958
You're saying
Shmucas didn't betray us?!

973
01:16:10.375 --> 01:16:11.625
-Do you believe him?

974
01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.416
Then I have an idea.

975
01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:22.166
Mm! Frol Style!
Madam is going to love it!

976
01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:27.250
Huh?

977
01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:35.208
Well? Where's our hero?

978
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:39.666
Hm! Hm!

979
01:16:39.708 --> 01:16:43.041
Go get Shmucas
and I'll deal with this one.

980
01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:45.083
-Huh?

981
01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:46.375
Hm!

982
01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:50.208
Argh!

983
01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:53.375
I will slice you into
robust little ribbons!

984
01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:03.666
Dot?

985
01:17:18.708 --> 01:17:20.833
Get back here.
you rotten cabbage!

986
01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:27.875
Oh-ho-ho! You have
awakened the beast now!

987
01:17:27.916 --> 01:17:30.416
Knock. knock! Anybody home?

988
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:37.791
Ooh!

989
01:18:11.416 --> 01:18:14.416
-Hm.

990
01:18:56.833 --> 01:19:00.500
Am I glad to see you!

991
01:19:02.583 --> 01:19:04.666
Ooh!

992
01:19:12.083 --> 01:19:13.666
Oh-oh-oh!

993
01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:16.000
Huh? Oh!

994
01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:35.125
Hm.

995
01:20:02.541 --> 01:20:07.083
So. that's where you're hiding.
you rotten old stump!

996
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:15.958
This is all my fault.

997
01:20:17.416 --> 01:20:19.750
I have to stop this.

998
01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:27.166
Supreme Spirit.

999
01:20:27.208 --> 01:20:29.458
the One Who Sits in the Rock.

1000
01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.375
I call on you!

1001
01:20:31.416 --> 01:20:36.083
No! Mavka. don't!

1002
01:20:46.083 --> 01:20:48.375
You have called me. Guardian.

1003
01:20:51.416 --> 01:20:56.166
I beg you. give me the strength
to answer my calling.

1004
01:20:56.208 --> 01:20:59.416
I need the Spark of Rage
to protect the forest.

1005
01:20:59.458 --> 01:21:03.166
The Spark of Rage has its price.

1006
01:21:03.208 --> 01:21:06.041
The price paid
by the previous guardian

1007
01:21:06.083 --> 01:21:09.333
was his enormous strength.

1008
01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:13.333
The rage burned him out
from the inside.

1009
01:21:13.375 --> 01:21:15.625
And you.

1010
01:21:15.666 --> 01:21:19.333
the Spark will cost you
your life.

1011
01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:24.250
You shall enter the Nothingness
for eternity.

1012
01:21:24.291 --> 01:21:28.750
I agree. for this
treacherous feeling here.

1013
01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:31.833
now it brings only pain.

1014
01:21:31.875 --> 01:21:35.166
As you wish. Guardian.

1015
01:21:39.583 --> 01:21:42.333
Ondina was right.

1016
01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:45.000
I was too nice.

1017
01:22:04.666 --> 01:22:07.333
Whoa!

1018
01:22:14.958 --> 01:22:16.750
I forgot to mention...

1019
01:22:16.791 --> 01:22:19.791
I've got you now. weed-face!

1020
01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:22.333
..I'm allergic to chainsaws!

1021
01:22:30.166 --> 01:22:31.500
Hush. you alright?

1022
01:22:31.541 --> 01:22:33.416
Oh. Shmucas!

1023
01:22:33.458 --> 01:22:37.375
I'm fine. Got some yellow spots.
but. overall. fine.

1024
01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:39.333
-Huh?

1025
01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:49.041
This village has the worst aura!

1026
01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:56.000
Hush. please.
I need to find Mavka!

1027
01:22:56.041 --> 01:22:58.875
What the hometown hurricane
is that?!

1028
01:22:58.916 --> 01:23:02.375
It seems that IS Mavka.

1029
01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:18.416
Oh!

1030
01:23:32.791 --> 01:23:34.541
-Whoa!

1031
01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:43.791
Mavka!

1032
01:23:43.833 --> 01:23:47.791
It's me. Lucas! I'm here!

1033
01:23:49.583 --> 01:23:52.000
Argh. I've got to get closer!

1034
01:23:52.041 --> 01:23:55.125
I might be able to help
with that.

1035
01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:01.875
Thank you. dear cousin.

1036
01:24:01.916 --> 01:24:06.458
Ha! They'll call me Hush.
who first befriended humans.

1037
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.958
Uh...uh... Whoa!

1038
01:24:12.708 --> 01:24:15.166
-Whoa!

1039
01:24:15.208 --> 01:24:17.791
Mavka! It's me!

1040
01:24:17.833 --> 01:24:20.291
Please! You have to stop!

1041
01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:23.500
Aah!

1042
01:24:25.041 --> 01:24:27.916
Whoa! Aah! Oh!

1043
01:24:30.625 --> 01:24:32.791
-Oh!

1044
01:24:34.458 --> 01:24:37.250
Where are you going?
You're gonna die!

1045
01:24:37.291 --> 01:24:41.000
I don't care.
I have to save her.

1046
01:24:41.041 --> 01:24:43.291
There's nothing you can do.

1047
01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:46.791
She can no longer understand
your words. Do you copy?

1048
01:24:46.833 --> 01:24:48.208
What did you say?

1049
01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:52.500
I said she can't hear
your words! Run!

1050
01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:55.416
Hush. you are a genius!

1051
01:24:55.458 --> 01:24:59.958
Finally I can scratch
hearing that off my bucket list!

1052
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.791
She can't hear my words.
but what if...

1053
01:25:34.333 --> 01:25:38.916
I got it! I got it!
They need our help.

1054
01:25:53.458 --> 01:25:56.541
We should all do this together!

1055
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Mavka. it's me.

1056
01:26:51.708 --> 01:26:55.250
Hear me. please!

1057
01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:09.625
Come back to me. Please!

1058
01:27:33.250 --> 01:27:37.666
Is this what Nothingness
feels like?

1059
01:27:37.708 --> 01:27:41.541
This is
the place of no phantom dreams.

1060
01:27:41.583 --> 01:27:45.416
where no songs are carried
by the wind.

1061
01:27:45.458 --> 01:27:49.458
The fire of hate and rage
does not burn here.

1062
01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:52.541
Rage doesn't burn
in my heart anymore.

1063
01:27:52.583 --> 01:27:58.666
I heard his voice and now
I know he never betrayed me.

1064
01:27:58.708 --> 01:28:02.333
You have chosen
to spare the lives of the humans

1065
01:28:02.375 --> 01:28:04.875
who have caused you
so much pain.

1066
01:28:06.416 --> 01:28:08.583
But they also
gave me something

1067
01:28:08.625 --> 01:28:11.000
I've never felt before.

1068
01:28:14.166 --> 01:28:16.500
We have made the right choice

1069
01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:19.625
making you the new guardian.

1070
01:28:19.666 --> 01:28:22.916
You have bridged the gap
between the humans

1071
01:28:22.958 --> 01:28:25.583
and the forest-dwellers.

1072
01:28:25.625 --> 01:28:29.500
but now you have to pay
the promised price

1073
01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:34.083
and remain in
the Nothingness forever.

1074
01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:36.125
For eternity.

1075
01:28:44.166 --> 01:28:45.666
No.

1076
01:28:45.708 --> 01:28:49.083
I'm alive
and I will live on forever

1077
01:28:49.125 --> 01:28:53.375
because now my heart is full of
something that will never die.

1078
01:29:12.583 --> 01:29:16.625
Through the darkness.
I heard your music.

1079
01:29:16.666 --> 01:29:20.583
It filled me here.

1080
01:29:20.625 --> 01:29:24.375
Your music is the real magic.

1081
01:29:24.416 --> 01:29:26.541
No.

1082
01:29:26.583 --> 01:29:30.708
The only magic humans have
is love.

1083
01:29:59.666 --> 01:30:01.791
Uh?

1084
01:30:05.291 --> 01:30:07.958
♪ Sing me
your woodland ballad... ♪

1085
01:30:09.291 --> 01:30:12.583
