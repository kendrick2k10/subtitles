1
00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:20.410
Follow me.

2
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.806
Come on. you...

3
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:51.687
Can't get a shot.

4
00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:08.871
Come on.

5
00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.921
Come on... come on.

6
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:44.119
There's a storm right now.
160 miles per hour.

7
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.116
And we still have gusts around 190.

8
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:53.124
So this area. this territory.
is certainly very much in danger.

9
00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.292
Fifteen inches of rainfall possible
across parts of Puerto Rico.

10
00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:03.551
And life-threatening mudslides
and really more flash flooding.

11
00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:08.306
This is where we will see
the storm surge. storm winds.

12
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.351
There will certainly be damage.

13
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.241
Jj

14
00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:12.332
The entire territory
will be absolutely under the control

15
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.832
of this category 4.
maybe category 5 storm.

16
00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.252
You got something we want.

17
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.012
- Walk normal. Walk normal.
- Right.

18
00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:37.270
If you say anything. I'll shoot you
and the person next to you.

19
00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.106
How can I help you?

20
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.777
Thank you.

21
00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.839
He... he wouldn't even tell me his hame.

22
00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.654
It was... it was arranged
through a third party.

23
00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.260
- I don't know anything...
- Calm down. calm down. It's okay.

24
00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:11.558
What's the address?

25
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.851
Here's Puerto Rico:

26
00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:20.810
3.5 million Americans live there.

27
00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:23.611
And here it comes. right along the shore.

28
00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.110
But San Juan is still going to have winds

29
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.943
of 130 to 140 miles an hour.

30
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.823
There will be weeks without power.

31
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.996
There may be weeks without water.

32
00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:35.657
- I need to sit.
- You're fine.

33
00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.242
I need... please. I need to...

34
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.373
John. John.

35
00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.999
Jj

36
00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.924
- Let's go.
- Where's babie?

37
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.762
The old prune panicked.
Babie was aborted.

38
00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.347
Come on. Let's go.

39
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.372
Jj

40
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.146
Whoo.

41
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.891
- Hey. Pete.
- Hey.

42
00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:48.107
Cardillo. I need the keys
to the prisoner holding cell.

43
00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.150
- Yes. sir. There you go.
- Thanks.

44
00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:52.862
Mom make bail?

45
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:57.901
- Cardillo!
- Wow. Yeah?

46
00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.237
This is officer pena.
She'll be assisting with the evac.

47
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.743
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

48
00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.540
The two of you will take the Van.

49
00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:06.913
You'll be scouring
every last motherfucking inch

50
00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:08.541
- for anybody that's left.
- Buyt...

51
00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:10.484
You find 'em. you take 'em
to the safety shelter.

52
00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.840
- I'm really looking forward to...
- That's not my job.

53
00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:16.419
It is today.
Get your ass out there.

54
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:17.754
Good luck.

55
00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.190
Okay. I'll wait for you outside.

56
00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.612
Fuck.

57
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.784
Hey.

58
00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.796
We're gonna get you those burgers. huh?

59
00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:02.640
Hey. man. Do you mind leaving some
for the rest of us?

60
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.644
- Excuse me?
- You took all the meat.

61
00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.311
Oh. god.

62
00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:15.357
Come on. man.
Need just some meat for my kid.

63
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.406
What do you wanna do. man. huh?

64
00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.575
You wanna fight me in front of your kid?

65
00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.825
Excuse me. Excuse me!

66
00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:29.247
That man just grabbed a pack of ground
beef right out of my son's hand.

67
00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:30.481
What? What are you talking about?

68
00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.838
What?

69
00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:37.292
Sir. I'm gonna have to take your cart
and ask you to leave.

70
00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.930
Whoa. whoa! Stop it!

71
00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:02.696
Any advice?

72
00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.037
About?

73
00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:08.456
This precinct. The residents.

74
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:14.546
Oh. Don't trust 'em. but...
That applies everywhere.

75
00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:19.251
Not just the places. where. um.
don't speak the fucking language.

76
00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:22.136
Oh. yeah?

77
00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:25.966
Well. uh. I'm actually trying
to transfer into this house.

78
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.973
Or rio piedras. I don't know.
Something with more action.

79
00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:32.430
- Yeah.
- It's slow as hell up in zone two.

80
00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.608
That's why I volunteered today.

81
00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.439
- Okay.
- Okay.

82
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:45.076
- So how are we gonna play this?
- Play what?

83
00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:49.289
What if people refuse to leave?

84
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.492
Well. then they die
horrible fucking deaths.

85
00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:56.371
But this good news is.
is it ain't our fault.

86
00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.749
We're not picking anybody up.

87
00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:06.215
Yeah. but. uh. it. Cunningham
said that we have to...

88
00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:10.348
Okay. okay. okay. Let's just say
that we go out and we grab a guy. right?

89
00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:12.303
He doesn't wanna leave.

90
00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:17.017
He wants your name. he wants your badge
number to file a complaint.

91
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.227
Yeah. let him. I'm doing my job.

92
00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:20.732
Oh. like that matters?

93
00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:24.407
You want a transfer or a promotion.

94
00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:27.861
and the bosses. they're gonna
look at your record. right?

95
00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:30.197
Oh. see you got a complaint.

96
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.532
Could be bullshit. Doesn't matter.

97
00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:36.119
You wash your hands at the sink
and you get splash back.

98
00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.375
it still looks like you pissed yourself.

99
00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:42.004
Okay. So we're doing nothing?

100
00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.631
That's the idea.

101
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.712
Maybe we'll get some donuts later.

102
00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:55.643
10-32. Plaza del mercado
de rio piedras.

103
00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:56.939
Don't.

104
00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.654
Show sector Adam-boy-Charlie responding.

105
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.198
All right.

106
00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:15.624
You insist.

107
00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.089
Alrighty then.

108
00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.673
What happened?

109
00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:36.058
Um. he was trying
to clear out the meat section.

110
00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.459
and he got into a fight with a customer.

111
00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:41.817
Mm... clear out the meat section.

112
00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:43.360
What. the entire section?

113
00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:46.611
Is there a law against
how much meat I can buy?

114
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.534
Sure isn't. but how much meat
were you trying to buy?

115
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.201
Just for the record.

116
00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.532
- A hundred pounds.
- Oh. wow.

117
00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:57.582
- Quite the party.
- Yeah. that's a lot of meat.

118
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.910
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

119
00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.417
Uh. where's the victim?

120
00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:09.341
Guy left. Didn't wanna press charges.

121
00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:12.048
All he wanted was to make hamburgers
for his little kid.

122
00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.496
- Well. that's adorable.
- See. the guy didn't wanna press charges.

123
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.511
Y'all gotta let me go. right?

124
00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:21.225
Yeah. well. you tell me what you need
all that meat for. I'll consider it.

125
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.910
Huh...

126
00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:34.737
That... is a little suspicious. Let's go.

127
00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.451
Let's go.

128
00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:40.625
Y'all arresting me?

129
00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.433
No. We're putting you on a bus
to a shelter.

130
00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:43.917
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Wait a minute.

131
00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.124
- Y'all can't do that.
- No?

132
00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.676
- I'm pretty sure we can.
- I have to stop past my place.

133
00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:51.550
- Yeah?
- Yo. officer. I'm being serious.

134
00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.223
- This is very important.
- No.

135
00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:57.344
Are you just gonna
give me one-word answers?

136
00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:59.144
- Maybe.
- All right. Let's go.

137
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.722
- You know what? Fuck you.
- Oh. no.

138
00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:01.897
- Fuck you. too.
- Oh. yeah?

139
00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:03.144
- Fuck you.
- You walk...

140
00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:05.648
Whoa! That escalated quickly.

141
00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:11.066
Yo. officer. I got some people at my place
that are refusing to leave.

142
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.240
Yeah. who?

143
00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.569
Well. there's this old guy
who never leaves.

144
00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:16.950
And a cop. One of you guys.

145
00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:18.827
How do you know they don't wanna leave?

146
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.749
Well. the old guy. he never leaves.

147
00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:23.397
And the cop was just bragging
about how he wasn't going anywhere.

148
00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:27.369
Look. I have a pet.
That's why I'm here at the supermarket.

149
00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.008
- You have a pet?
- Yeah.

150
00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:32.007
- What kind of pet?
- A hungry one.

151
00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.931
- Uh-huh. What's its name?
- Her name is Janet.

152
00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:37.383
Yeah. I don't... I don't like that.

153
00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:39.639
Well. Janet doesn't like cops.
Look. guys...

154
00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:46.025
Y'all can arrest me.
do whatever the hell you wanna do.

155
00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:48.774
But I need to feed her
and get her some water before the storm.

156
00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:51.064
Please.

157
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.447
You said there's a cop that won't leave?

158
00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:56.778
Yeah.

159
00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:00.706
All right. Let's go feed your fuckin' cat.

160
00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.013
That the super?

161
00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:21.389
Yeah.

162
00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:24.104
Yeah. that's him.

163
00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.903
- What's your name?
- Luillo.

164
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:35.994
All right. Louie Joe.

165
00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.990
This guy says you got residents
that are refusing to evacuate.

166
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:40.081
That's right.

167
00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:42.873
He said you got a retired cop
and an old guy.

168
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.168
- Old guy in 15e.
- And the cop?

169
00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:48.712
Barrett. 53b.

170
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.381
All right. let's grab Barrett.

171
00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:53.750
and then we'll swing back down
and grab the old guy. okay?

172
00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:55.510
- Okay.
- You gonna let me feed Janet?

173
00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:58.089
- What apartment number you in?
- 33b.

174
00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.015
- Is that true?
- Yes.

175
00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:02.539
All right. do it quick.
We'll grab you in five minutes. all right?

176
00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.428
Fine.

177
00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:14.188
Does that say "out of order?”

178
00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:16.194
What is that? I

179
00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.991
- si.
- Si sj

180
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.239
perfect.

181
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.616
All right.

182
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.917
You know. you should learn some Spanish.

183
00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:29.620
- Yeah.
- Yeah. you're in Puerto Rico.

184
00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:33.583
- Yeah.
- That's how we say it. Puerto Rico.

185
00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:50.558
Can you get them to fuck off?

186
00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:52.609
We're evacuating the building.

187
00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.023
We're evacuating the building.

188
00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:58.654
Thank god. I need your help.

189
00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.530
Look. even the pd's taking this seriously.

190
00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.452
Yeah. current pd's full of pussies

191
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.747
who care more about
liability and politics.

192
00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.194
I'm staying here. I'm not leaving.

193
00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:07.913
I'm not going anywhere.

194
00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:12.792
You gonna take that risk?

195
00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:17.968
Well. hurricane Irene
started like this. came to nothing.

196
00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:20.046
She wants to take me to centro medico.

197
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:23.053
That third-rate shithole.
I mean. that's death depot.

198
00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:24.884
We used to take the od cases there.

199
00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:27.015
I don't recall seeing any
of them ever again.

200
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:30.815
Well. unfortunately. sir.
it's either that or the evac bus.

201
00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:35.269
Excuse me. senorita.

202
00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.282
You all right there?

203
00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:39.322
You worked in rio piedras?

204
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.401
Yeah. I used to run that house.

205
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:43.820
Do I know you?

206
00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:45.915
I know you.

207
00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.950
'Cause I just put in a transfer there.

208
00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:52.208
Is that right?
Where do I know you from?

209
00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:53.458
I know you.

210
00:18:58.721 --> 00:19:03.431
- I know you from someplace.
- Uh... from this evac.

211
00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:05.758
- Sir. can we get your stuff?
- Yeah. let's get going.

212
00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:07.138
You're cardillo.

213
00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:11.480
Yeah. Yeah. yeah. cardillo. You had that
thing about a year ago. right?

214
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.067
Yeah? How'd it go down?

215
00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:21.407
It got me down here.
Don't worry about it.

216
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:24.242
I'm not worried about it.

217
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.156
They ever catch the guy
that made the call?

218
00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:34.629
- Eventually. yeah.
- Yeah? Did you beat his ass?

219
00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:36.330
- Dad...
- Did I what?

220
00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:37.505
Did you beat his ass?

221
00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:40.801
Hey. back in my day.
we had this moron called Willie bosket.

222
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:43.925
He used to call the stationhouse
to report a rape or a robbery.

223
00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:47.804
We'd all rush down there. the guy'd be on
the roof with a bb gun. sniping us.

224
00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.374
About the third time round.
we caught him and broke a few fingers.

225
00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:53.481
- Nice. dad. That's real nice.
- Hey. it stopped him. Okay?

226
00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:57.480
- Yep.
- Hey. the other cop. the partner.

227
00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:59.152
That was your girl. right?

228
00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:10.365
Troy. honey. uh. I think
I like my odds better here.

229
00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:13.041
I'm a stubborn asshole.
she takes after me.

230
00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:14.856
I'm standing right here.
you know what I mean?

231
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.962
Hey. what do you think
I got fuckin' Alzheimer's...

232
00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:20.212
It's a category 5 fuckin' hurricane goin'
on outside. you forgot about that.

233
00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:22.338
You think it's a five already?

234
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.092
Hey. lay it out for me.
How did it go down?

235
00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:26.638
Tell me.

236
00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:30.096
All right. I'm gonna go
grab the other old guy.

237
00:20:30.187 --> 00:20:32.143
- Sir. I highly advise...
- Other old guy?

238
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:34.334
- That you go with your daughter.
- Yes. thank you.

239
00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:36.974
- Or in this case. your guardian.
- Oh. a fuckin' comedian. yeah.

240
00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.775
And it's only out of respect for the badge

241
00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.855
that you're not on a 5150 hold.
face down on the ground.

242
00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.385
- hog-tied and fuckin' cuffed...
- Whoa. whoa. hey!

243
00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:44.615
What. you gonna shoot me. too?

244
00:20:44.702 --> 00:20:46.784
Okay. you hear me. you crazy old fuck?!

245
00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:49.032
- Shut the fuck up!
- You cop-killing cocksucker!

246
00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:51.788
- Hey!
- Where you goin'?

247
00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:53.036
- Where you goin'?
- You stay!

248
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:55.355
Yeah. and don't go with that guy.
Not without a bulletproof vest.

249
00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:56.915
Honestly. you are so fuckin' stubborn.

250
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:01.836
This guy's your fuckin' partner?

251
00:21:02.845 --> 00:21:04.051
Yep.

252
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:07.880
You're a very brave girl.

253
00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:09.465
Hey. hey! What are you...

254
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.176
What are you doing?
You're just gonna leave?

255
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:15.513
Your dad doesn't wanna leave. ma'am.
I can't force him.

256
00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:18.103
Isn't that what you're here for?

257
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.339
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to carry him down?

258
00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:23.900
Hey. you know what.
I don't care what you do.

259
00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:26.107
He needs his dialysis machine.

260
00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:29.410
Once the storm knocks
the power out in this building.

261
00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:32.660
nothing's gonna work.
No machine is gonna work.

262
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.911
I have a bed for him
reserved at the hospital.

263
00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:37.288
but if we don't get there soon.
we lose it.

264
00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:41.789
You really a doctor?

265
00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:45.839
No. I just like wearing pajamas all day.

266
00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:49.964
Look. all I'm asking you to do
is to go back in there with me

267
00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:52.019
and help me get him the fuck out
of this building.

268
00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:57.142
Well. officer pena's with him. okay?
She'll take him down.

269
00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:01.896
He doesn't exactly respond
to female authority.

270
00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:10.655
All right.

271
00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:12.156
You know this old guy. right?

272
00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:17.742
Yeah. I've seen him around.

273
00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:20.749
Do me a favor. and help me with him.

274
00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:23.276
And once we get him out.
we'll come back up.

275
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.040
and we'll grab your father. Okay?

276
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.051
All right. Come on.

277
00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:38.053
Around the corner to the left.

278
00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:41.648
Down there. Straight ahead.

279
00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:49.094
This guy always
have this much security?

280
00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:51.279
Not that I recall. Sir?

281
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.985
Hello. sir. it's Troy Barrett.

282
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.490
You know my father. ray.

283
00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.622
Hello. sir.

284
00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:02.290
What can I help you with?

285
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:03.791
You need to come with us. sir.

286
00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:05.589
No. I cannot leave.

287
00:23:05.676 --> 00:23:07.507
You're gonna be
flooded out here if you stay.

288
00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:09.460
you're on the first floor.
It's too dangerous.

289
00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:12.467
Has your father left?

290
00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:15.974
We're gonna evacuate him
right after you.

291
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.676
Cardillo to pena.

292
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:19.499
The sooner you come with me.
we're gonna get him.

293
00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:20.792
we're gonna get everyone safe
out of the building.

294
00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:22.272
Pena. are you there?

295
00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:33.029
Cardillo. you copy?

296
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.360
Crickets. huh?

297
00:23:35.372 --> 00:23:37.158
All your comms are down in this shit.

298
00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:42.535
Hey. listen. sweetheart.
You don't need to babysit me. okay.

299
00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:51.044
So you ran rio piedras. huh?

300
00:23:52.306 --> 00:23:54.592
Yeah. you're not leaving. Okay.

301
00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:56.719
Okay. you don't take a hint. do ya?

302
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.971
I'll be clearer.
You can go now. Thank you. It's...

303
00:23:59.063 --> 00:24:01.019
- So...
- I'm good. thank you.

304
00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:04.724
I'm trying to transfer into that house.
but it's being held up.

305
00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:10.063
So... you think you can put in...
A word for me?

306
00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:19.909
- I'm sorry.
- Pefia. do you copy?

307
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.709
I know it feels safer to stay here.
but we gotta get to higher ground.

308
00:24:23.796 --> 00:24:25.607
You cannot park there!
Keep it moving!

309
00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:29.249
I'm safer here. I'm not leaving.
I cannot leave my home.

310
00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:34.087
Hey! Hey! You cannot park there.

311
00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:40.430
Keep it moving! Get out!

312
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.472
You cannot park there!

313
00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:45.976
I'll take care of this.

314
00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:54.565
What is it with these stubborn bastards
in this building?

315
00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.820
- You have to come with us.
- I'm sorry. I'm not going.

316
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.532
- Officer!
- Hold on just a second.

317
00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:00.908
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

318
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.912
- So you can go.
- No. this is an evacuation.

319
00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:08.875
It is closed.
They are closing the roads.

320
00:25:08.966 --> 00:25:12.299
Please. keep going. Come on. man.

321
00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:15.674
Take it easy. Take it easy...

322
00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:18.972
Jj

323
00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:31.856
Let's go! Let's go! We gotta go now!

324
00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:33.483
- Why?
- We've gotta go right now.

325
00:25:33.574 --> 00:25:36.782
Come on! Come on!

326
00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:38.905
Right now!

327
00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:43.284
Okay. Come here.
Come on! Quick. quick!

328
00:25:44.293 --> 00:25:46.124
Ernesto...

329
00:25:55.596 --> 00:25:57.257
It's a fucking cop!

330
00:25:59.475 --> 00:26:00.555
No. no. no. Don't shoot.

331
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.970
You might hit the old man.

332
00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:08.139
Migs. you need to catch up
to them. Top floor.

333
00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:13.318
- Who the hell were those guys?
- I have no idea.

334
00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:14.645
We have to get back to my dad.

335
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.402
No. it's too far. We won't make it.
They'll see us.

336
00:26:17.493 --> 00:26:20.075
- Well. then where are we going?
- Up.

337
00:26:20.162 --> 00:26:22.744
Come... come on. Come on.

338
00:26:26.752 --> 00:26:28.708
What are we gonna do
about the fucking cop?

339
00:26:28.796 --> 00:26:31.003
Don't get excited. They're trapped.

340
00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.049
Those stairs only lead up
and the only exit is on this floor.

341
00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:37.842
Dillon. start your way on top
and work your way down.

342
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.842
Pride. Ernesto.
you two guard the front door.

343
00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:44.642
Nobody gets in. Nobody gets out.
Okay? Go.

344
00:26:56.532 --> 00:26:57.942
Let's go.

345
00:26:59.368 --> 00:27:02.701
Janet! I'm sorry. baby. I'm coming.

346
00:27:02.788 --> 00:27:04.528
I got caught up in the supermarket.

347
00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:08.414
All right. Here we go.

348
00:27:08.502 --> 00:27:10.208
I know. I know. I know. I know.

349
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.626
Griffin!
Open the door. right now!

350
00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:16.957
Open the door.

351
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.585
I'll meet you downstairs.

352
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.600
Open the door. Griffin.

353
00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:26.183
Griffin. open the door!
You gotta let us in. right now.

354
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.727
Fuck that!

355
00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:30.270
How I know you're not setting me up?

356
00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:34.598
Back. back. back...

357
00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:37.315
Griffin. you think this is a trap?
I let you go earlier.

358
00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:40.569
Listen. I've got Troy
and your downstairs neighbor here.

359
00:27:40.659 --> 00:27:41.719
If you don't let us in right now.

360
00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:44.576
we are gonna get our
motherfuckin' heads blown off!

361
00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:47.120
Open the door!

362
00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:49.831
Open the door.

363
00:27:49.918 --> 00:27:51.374
Shit.

364
00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:56.004
We on the same side?

365
00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:57.831
Hey. do me a favor. all right?

366
00:27:57.926 --> 00:28:00.542
Put your ear to the door.
I'm gonna tell you something.

367
00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:03.219
- Put your ear to the door!
- My ear's to the goddamn door!

368
00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:06.006
Okay.

369
00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:09.017
Open the fucking door!

370
00:28:12.274 --> 00:28:13.274
Okay.

371
00:28:17.696 --> 00:28:19.152
Central. 10-13.

372
00:28:20.407 --> 00:28:23.991
- Shots fired. Okay.
- Who's killing who?

373
00:28:24.077 --> 00:28:26.681
- Just quiet down. Be quiet.
- No. you quiet down! You in my house.

374
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:27.932
Shots fired at...
What's the address here?

375
00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:30.038
- Six... sixty-five...
- Six-five-eight.

376
00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:34.710

377
00:28:34.796 --> 00:28:37.003
Fuck! Landline.
I need a landline.

378
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.526
- Do you have a landline?
- Sorry. man.

379
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.694
I didn't get the fuckin' bundle.

380
00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:41.446
- Who the fuck's got a landline. man?
- Oh. fuck.

381
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.553
You know. you guys bust into my place
without any consideration.

382
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.950
I don't give a fuck who shot who.

383
00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:47.854
Super Louie Joe...

384
00:28:47.935 --> 00:28:49.721
Well. he's super fucking dead. okay?

385
00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:55.939
Oh. shit! Oh. shit!

386
00:28:58.237 --> 00:28:59.277
Give me that bowl of food!

387
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:03.318
- What?
- Give me that bowl of food!

388
00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:05.148
- What food?
- Give me the bowl of food!

389
00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:06.950
- What?
- Give me the bowl of food!

390
00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:13.782
Help!

391
00:29:18.715 --> 00:29:21.047
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- What?

392
00:29:21.134 --> 00:29:23.341
- Don't shoot.
- Don't shoot?

393
00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:26.010
Just bring me that bowl of food.

394
00:29:27.266 --> 00:29:29.222
- What?
- Bring me the bowl of food!

395
00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:31.766
It's right behind you.
Bring me the bowl of food.

396
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:33.977
Okay...

397
00:29:37.901 --> 00:29:39.437
The whole thing?

398
00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:43.479
Oh. my god.

399
00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:48.442
What the fuck?

400
00:29:51.415 --> 00:29:52.951
Stop. stop...

401
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:56.408
- What?
- Take off your uniform.

402
00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:58.368
Take off my fucking uniform?

403
00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:01.375
Yeah. She hates cops. I trained her.

404
00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:04.708
If you don't want her to bite
your fuckin' ass. take your uniform off.

405
00:30:17.274 --> 00:30:19.265
Okay. Tell me your story.

406
00:30:20.277 --> 00:30:23.047
- What do you mean? What kind of story?
- A Disney story. What do you think?

407
00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:25.778
I want your story.
Like your best collar.

408
00:30:25.866 --> 00:30:28.152
If you want a rec.
you gotta gimme something to work with.

409
00:30:30.746 --> 00:30:35.490
There was a warrant out on a murder
suspect about five months back.

410
00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:39.293
I'm on patrol driving
by the burger king off avenida ashford.

411
00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:41.665
And I see a guy in the parking lot.

412
00:30:41.757 --> 00:30:45.750
Six-two. 160. long hair.

413
00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:47.334
We park and approach.

414
00:30:47.429 --> 00:30:51.013
But as I'm getting closer.
I realize it's not the guy.

415
00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:02.183
Slow. Nothing too quick.

416
00:31:02.277 --> 00:31:03.483
Oh. my god.

417
00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:07.062
All right.
Now you gonna grab my hand.

418
00:31:07.157 --> 00:31:08.192
All right.

419
00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:10.899
And when I say.
pull me out as fast as you can.

420
00:31:10.994 --> 00:31:12.279
- Yeah. yeah.
- Okay.

421
00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:14.737
- All right.
- Okay. here we go. Okay.

422
00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:15.911
Go!

423
00:31:17.084 --> 00:31:18.924
Close the door!
Close the door! Close the door!

424
00:31:21.838 --> 00:31:23.453
What the fuck is that?!

425
00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:26.085
Oh. shit.

426
00:31:27.344 --> 00:31:30.461
- I lost them.
- You lost them?

427
00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:32.200
They gotta be somewhere else
in the building.

428
00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:34.966
- There's no other way out.
- No. Shut the fuck up.

429
00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.516
All right? No excuses!

430
00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:41.931
Okay? Go find them. Now. go!

431
00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:01.370
Griffin. that's your fucking pet?

432
00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:04.999
You got a killing machine
for a fucking service animal.

433
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.671
Okay. we got a problem.

434
00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:08.874
What kinda bedside manner talk is this?

435
00:32:08.969 --> 00:32:10.960
"We got a problem?”
you don't wanna ease me in?

436
00:32:11.054 --> 00:32:12.840
I could really use a saw.

437
00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:17.095
Yeah. this would be a great point
for an amputee.

438
00:32:17.185 --> 00:32:20.427
- No. you're not cutting my leg off!
- We don't have time to ease you in.

439
00:32:20.522 --> 00:32:22.137
What do you need?

440
00:32:22.232 --> 00:32:24.268
Uh. a splint to secure the femur.

441
00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:28.272
Antiseptic. penicillin. gauze. stitches.

442
00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:32.982
- I know a doctor.
- Congratulations.

443
00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:35.408
He's here in the building.

444
00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:38.487
- Dr. berman.
- Yeah. what apartment? Where?

445
00:32:38.582 --> 00:32:42.871
- It's. uh... 63b.
- Shit...

446
00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:46.378
All right. I'll go get that stuff.

447
00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:48.192
- Well. I'll come with you.
- No. no. you gotta stay here with him.

448
00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:50.194
No. I'll come with you.
The sooner we take care of this.

449
00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:51.778
the sooner I can get back to my father.

450
00:32:52.721 --> 00:32:55.463
- All right.
- Hey. come over here. Come here.

451
00:32:55.557 --> 00:32:57.047
Come. I need your help.

452
00:32:57.142 --> 00:32:58.678
I need you to take both your hands

453
00:32:58.768 --> 00:33:01.134
and apply pressure
to this wound. okay? Hard.

454
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.476
Talk to him. keep him awake.
It's just as important

455
00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:07.211
as applying pressure
to the wound. You got it?

456
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:08.475
- Of course.
- Okay.

457
00:33:09.905 --> 00:33:10.905
- Griffin...
- Hm?

458
00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:12.980
There any back stairs?
Alternate routes up?

459
00:33:13.074 --> 00:33:14.814
There's only one set of stairs.

460
00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:17.117
And the elevator.
but the elevator's out.

461
00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:18.614
Yeah. of course it is.

462
00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:21.117
But there's another way.

463
00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:22.664
Scaffolding.

464
00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.036
Scaffolding.

465
00:33:32.636 --> 00:33:37.300
So. oh. yeah. The guy we're looking for
has tats and this guy's clean.

466
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:42.305
But something was off. He looks nervous.

467
00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:45.808
My radar starts going off.
and that's when I see it.

468
00:33:47.275 --> 00:33:48.515
What?

469
00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:52.194
A giant bulge sticking out of his...

470
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.943
- You know...
- What. his crotch? What?

471
00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:58.116
No. his ass.

472
00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:02.955
I see the top of a plastic baggie
sticking out of the top of his pants.

473
00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:05.282
I ask him what it is. he goes nuts.

474
00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:07.993
We cuff him. take him back
to the stationhouse.

475
00:34:08.088 --> 00:34:13.503
and when we strip search him.
we find 93 baggies of crack cocaine.

476
00:34:15.053 --> 00:34:17.294
Biggest narcotics collar that month.

477
00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:20.388
- Biggest.
- Wow.

478
00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:23.592
So what you're telling me
is you stumble onto a narcotics collar.

479
00:34:23.687 --> 00:34:27.350
all because some moron had a family-sized
baggie sticking out of his ass?

480
00:34:28.567 --> 00:34:29.932
That's your best collar?

481
00:34:31.403 --> 00:34:33.359
You didn't even have probable cause.

482
00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:41.781
- Never mind.
- No. you know. I'm just saying.

483
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:43.140
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
They should be done by now.

484
00:34:43.164 --> 00:34:45.405
I'm... I'm gonna go check on them.

485
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.331
- Yeah...
- Yeah. you can do...

486
00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:49.375
You can do. you know. whatever.

487
00:34:51.506 --> 00:34:54.043
I'm such an asshole.

488
00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:57.254
- You got it?
- Yeah.

489
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:11.682
So. two flights up and three units over.

490
00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:14.813
Yeah. Are you a good shot?

491
00:35:14.904 --> 00:35:17.646
- Yeah. why?
- Do me a favor.

492
00:35:17.741 --> 00:35:19.902
If I fall. shoot me.

493
00:35:19.993 --> 00:35:23.235
I don't wanna wait four-and-a-half hours
to die of a brain hemorrhage.

494
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.695
Yeah. what if I fall?

495
00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:27.201
You're hard-headed. You'll survive.

496
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:36.043
- Ready?
- Blow it.

497
00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:04.279
Watch it. sweetheart.

498
00:36:04.371 --> 00:36:06.908
Take your hand off your gun. slowly.

499
00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:09.080
Hands in the air.

500
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:12.576
Where are they?

501
00:36:14.464 --> 00:36:15.795
Where are who?

502
00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:17.793
Your partner and the old man.

503
00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:25.346
- Follow me. I'll show you.
- Go.

504
00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:29.725
Better not be fucking with me.

505
00:36:32.399 --> 00:36:33.684
Come on.

506
00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:39.564
Hey! You mind pointing
that gun somewhere else?

507
00:36:39.656 --> 00:36:40.941
Hey. shut the fuck up.

508
00:36:42.742 --> 00:36:44.983
Is this it?

509
00:36:45.078 --> 00:36:46.193
This is it.

510
00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:49.492
You go first.

511
00:36:49.582 --> 00:36:51.197
If this is a fucking ambush.

512
00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:53.283
I swear to god. I will fucking kill you.

513
00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:54.413
Hey. asshole!

514
00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:03.506
Oh. yeah. Come on. now
help me drag him inside.

515
00:37:03.596 --> 00:37:06.087
He's a heavy motherfucker.

516
00:37:06.182 --> 00:37:08.047
Yeah. come on. Come on. buddy.

517
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:15.350
Boss!

518
00:37:32.417 --> 00:37:34.999
Get down there.
I'll go check on Chaz. Go.

519
00:37:41.801 --> 00:37:43.712
Don't worry.

520
00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:45.759
She won't break through.

521
00:37:50.477 --> 00:37:52.138
What's your name?

522
00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:57.810
- Paul.
- Paul...

523
00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:03.107
What's the accent? German?

524
00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:06.401
- German. yes.
- Mm-hm.

525
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.150
I'm Jason.

526
00:38:09.245 --> 00:38:13.204
I would offer to shake your hand. but I
really need you to keep pushing down.

527
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:14.872
Of course.

528
00:38:58.962 --> 00:39:00.122
Give me the gun.

529
00:39:07.554 --> 00:39:09.545
Jj

530
00:39:29.784 --> 00:39:32.241
Oh. shit.

531
00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:41.118
- Hey. you okay?
- Yeah.

532
00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:48.083
They're on the fourth floor. heading up.

533
00:39:48.177 --> 00:39:50.384
- Where's Ernesto?
- He's dead.

534
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:52.553
Bigger splits for the rest of us.

535
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.517
Ah... you recognize that name?

536
00:40:01.608 --> 00:40:05.351
Alexander Dillon. No. No. should I?

537
00:40:05.445 --> 00:40:08.653
You want to work the good cases.
you gotta know the players.

538
00:40:10.575 --> 00:40:12.566
- Who is he?
- He's part of a crew.

539
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.025
He does high-end heist jobs...

540
00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.031
Jewelry. museums. armored trucks.

541
00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:20.748
The shot caller's
a real psycho piece of shit.

542
00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:23.042
Calls himself John the baptist.

543
00:40:23.129 --> 00:40:25.461
I got a buddy downtown.
a lieutenant I trained.

544
00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:27.504
he works the major crime zone three.

545
00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:30.299
He's been chasing these clowns
for a... for a month.

546
00:40:32.305 --> 00:40:34.216
You okay? Are you all right?

547
00:40:34.307 --> 00:40:37.891
Yeah. Hey. can you do me a favor?
Get my pills.

548
00:40:37.977 --> 00:40:40.468
Oxy. oxy-whatever the fuck you call it.

549
00:40:40.563 --> 00:40:42.394
I can't pronounce it.
Uh. not that room.

550
00:40:42.482 --> 00:40:44.973
The next door down.
That's my wife's art studio.

551
00:40:45.068 --> 00:40:46.854
The next door down is the bathroom.

552
00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:51.775
So did you read the paper?

553
00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:54.357
Today? No. No. why?

554
00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:57.944
So this crew targets
this blue-haired old bag.

555
00:40:58.039 --> 00:41:01.873
But the pop the old girl before they
can finish the job. the greedy fuckers.

556
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.123
That was this guy Dillon?
It's empty. by the way.

557
00:41:05.213 --> 00:41:07.499
Ah. yeah. thanks. This guy? Yeah.

558
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.150
My buddy thinks he's one of them. yeah.

559
00:41:09.217 --> 00:41:13.381
I haven't worn this
in 15 years. Wonder if it still fits.

560
00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:16.552
- What... what do you think this guy wants?
- Yeah...

561
00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:20.592
I might have a pretty good idea.

562
00:41:20.687 --> 00:41:24.851
But if you're trying to make
an impression. now's the time. Let's go.

563
00:41:29.946 --> 00:41:32.278
- What apartment is this?
- 44b.

564
00:41:32.365 --> 00:41:34.697
All right. One up and two over.

565
00:41:37.704 --> 00:41:40.821
She's this woman.
came into the hospital a bunch of times.

566
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.742
Claimed cops used to hold her down
and inject rat blood in her eyes.

567
00:41:44.836 --> 00:41:47.122
What? Roberta gradischer?

568
00:41:47.213 --> 00:41:50.000
- You know her?
- Oh. yeah.

569
00:41:51.009 --> 00:41:52.249
Wait a second.

570
00:41:54.012 --> 00:41:55.172
It was you.

571
00:41:56.931 --> 00:42:00.423
Right? It was you. That's what my father
was referring to downstairs.

572
00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:02.850
Uh. partially. yeah.

573
00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:06.429
Oh. my god.
She used to say it was two cops.

574
00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:08.310
- Smith...
- No. Smythe.

575
00:42:08.401 --> 00:42:11.188
Smith and Smythe. Exactly.

576
00:42:11.279 --> 00:42:12.894
Did you treat her?

577
00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:15.446
After four times.
I had to give her an eye dropper.

578
00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:17.398
Told her there was holy water in it.

579
00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:20.735
That's funny. She actually
brought that down to the lab.

580
00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:23.537
She wanted us to test it for rat poison.

581
00:42:23.624 --> 00:42:27.458
See? She didn't trust me either.

582
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:29.831
She wanted me to file a police report.

583
00:42:29.922 --> 00:42:32.208
On me? Wait.

584
00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:35.007
I et me see that.

585
00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:36.630
- Come here.
- Oh. no. it's nothing.

586
00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:37.881
- Come here.
- Oh. it's fine.

587
00:42:37.972 --> 00:42:39.382
Come here.

588
00:42:39.474 --> 00:42:40.884
It'll push itself out.

589
00:42:41.934 --> 00:42:44.471
- It's a surface wound.
- Yeah. it's fine.

590
00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:48.146
No. it was a police report.
It was for the commissioner.

591
00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:50.097
Yeah. she. uh...

592
00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:54.983
She thought that the police commissioner
was stealing her coupons.

593
00:42:55.073 --> 00:42:59.112
No! Shit. She's fuckin' nuts.

594
00:43:24.352 --> 00:43:26.638
You mind if I ask you something?

595
00:43:26.729 --> 00:43:30.563
I mind if you ask permission.
You wanna ask something. just ask.

596
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.107
What... what the hell did you stay for?

597
00:43:33.194 --> 00:43:35.355
I mean. you had to know the storm was
gonna be bad.

598
00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:36.982
Right?

599
00:43:37.073 --> 00:43:38.233
Yeah.

600
00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:42.734
Do you know what a fecal transplant is?

601
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:44.911
- A what?
- A fecal transplant.

602
00:43:44.997 --> 00:43:46.578
It's exactly what it sounds like.

603
00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:50.284
Doctor takes someone else's shit.
puts it in your body.

604
00:43:50.378 --> 00:43:51.738
- What the hell for?
- Yeah. right.

605
00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:54.458
It's good for colitis or something.
Troy wants me to do that.

606
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:56.255
I also got some other bullshit going on.

607
00:43:56.342 --> 00:43:58.549
Kidneys. lungs. they're fucked.

608
00:43:58.636 --> 00:44:00.922
It's gonna kill me. eventually.
I'm on a million pills.

609
00:44:01.013 --> 00:44:04.255
She takes me to the hospital. it's over.
and I'm not going out that way.

610
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.308
Jackpot!

611
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.806
So you are or aren't full of shit?

612
00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:17.518
Shut the fuck up.

613
00:44:20.616 --> 00:44:22.732
I ran out of my prescription.

614
00:44:22.827 --> 00:44:26.695
- What's that?
- Oxy-moron. It's good for the pain.

615
00:44:26.789 --> 00:44:28.825
- Want one?
- I'm good.

616
00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:30.076
Okay.

617
00:44:41.387 --> 00:44:43.298
Okay. Let's go. smartass.

618
00:44:43.389 --> 00:44:46.426
Okay.

619
00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.849
- Wait. wait. wait.
- What?

620
00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:51.723
- Where we going?
- Oh. Apartment 44a.

621
00:44:51.814 --> 00:44:54.271
Ex-DEA agent lives there.
He's armed to the teeth.

622
00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:56.064
He's like a survivalist.

623
00:44:56.152 --> 00:44:58.112
See. if we're gonna stand
any kinda chance at all.

624
00:44:58.196 --> 00:44:59.857
we need all the firepower we can get.

625
00:44:59.947 --> 00:45:01.312
Remember. shoot to kill. kid.

626
00:45:01.407 --> 00:45:03.819
I got your back.
You got mine. all right?

627
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:05.275
Here we go.

628
00:45:08.664 --> 00:45:11.656
Jj

629
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.881
Get the fuck in.

630
00:45:35.358 --> 00:45:36.438
Fuck.

631
00:45:41.614 --> 00:45:43.024
Drop it.

632
00:45:45.076 --> 00:45:47.692
Drop it. Drop it.

633
00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:50.570
Slowly.

634
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:53.701
Now toss it.

635
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:56.750
Come on.

636
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.586
Don't fucking move
or I'll blow your head off.

637
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:01.797
Where's the old man?

638
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:05.968
He's up my ass.
you wanna tickle his feet?

639
00:47:39.899 --> 00:47:41.309
Come on.

640
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.186
I can't get a shot.

641
00:48:36.205 --> 00:48:38.617
Wow! Oh. come on. Come on.

642
00:48:41.127 --> 00:48:43.584
- You shot me!
- Come on!

643
00:48:45.506 --> 00:48:47.792
Come on!

644
00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:50.295
I couldn't help it. You were in the way.

645
00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:58.265
Where the hell did they go?
Did you see?

646
00:48:58.352 --> 00:49:00.468
You're kidding me.
I couldn't see anything.

647
00:49:00.563 --> 00:49:02.428
You're supposed to be my eyes. kid.

648
00:49:02.523 --> 00:49:04.013
Okay. watch out.

649
00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:06.269
Hey. hey! Don't. I got a key.

650
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.147
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- This guy's a friendly.

651
00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:10.694
I think it's this one.

652
00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:11.941
Yeah. there you go.

653
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:17.159
Everything I told you. right? Huh?

654
00:49:17.246 --> 00:49:19.703
One-stop shopping. ladies and gentlemen.

655
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.452
- Holy shit.
- Choose your weapon.

656
00:49:22.543 --> 00:49:24.408
Take your pick.

657
00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:52.728
You a Nazi?

658
00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:01.491
You don't like people like me.

659
00:50:06.086 --> 00:50:07.667
Oh. no. I...

660
00:50:09.089 --> 00:50:13.048
I don't... feel that way anymore.

661
00:50:13.135 --> 00:50:15.922
I didn't think there was no Nazis left.

662
00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:21.261
I guess there gotta be some.

663
00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:24.389
But they must be old
as shit like your ass.

664
00:50:33.447 --> 00:50:34.607
Yeah.

665
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:44.116
Can you hold this?

666
00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:50.206
Bullet passed straight through the calf.

667
00:50:50.297 --> 00:50:53.789
Tibia. fibula clear.

668
00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:56.671
Lucky me. huh?

669
00:50:57.721 --> 00:51:01.305
No... I'm a good shot.

670
00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:07.724
Yeah.

671
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:14.019
Yeah. one Thanksgiving. my dad...

672
00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:18.989
He went out and bought
a bunch of frozen turkeys.

673
00:51:20.619 --> 00:51:23.326
Not for eating them.

674
00:51:23.414 --> 00:51:26.577
But he brought them home to just
shoot the fuck out of them all.

675
00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:30.376
- Just filled those birds up with lead.
- Just...

676
00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:34.413
Target practice.

677
00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:39.422
And I was really excited. 'cause...

678
00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:42.630
I always wanted to be a doctor.

679
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:45.512
And I loved it 'cause...

680
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.557
I got to pick all the bullets
out of the birds and...

681
00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:52.352
Stitch up all the holes.

682
00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:54.479
Wow.

683
00:51:56.405 --> 00:51:59.693
So what were you and my dad
really talking about downstairs?

684
00:52:06.248 --> 00:52:07.408
Well...

685
00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:10.199
For real.

686
00:52:15.841 --> 00:52:19.004
I used to be on the detective squad
out in New York.

687
00:52:20.137 --> 00:52:21.968
Real busy.

688
00:52:22.056 --> 00:52:24.968
Never a down moment. I loved it.

689
00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:31.016
And. uh. I hear a call
for a gun run one night.

690
00:52:31.106 --> 00:52:35.725
And. uh. I'm close. like four blocks away.

691
00:52:37.738 --> 00:52:40.150
I don't even hesitate. Take it.

692
00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.776
But I'm with Jasmine.

693
00:52:42.785 --> 00:52:44.992
Uh. she's my. um...

694
00:52:47.915 --> 00:52:49.246
I get it.

695
00:52:55.297 --> 00:52:57.879
That's actually just not far from here.

696
00:52:57.966 --> 00:52:59.957
No. baby. please...

697
00:53:00.052 --> 00:53:02.213
She asked me not to take the call.

698
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:07.135
Jasmine was a cop. too.

699
00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:12.311
But I told her. you know.
stay in the car and...

700
00:53:13.524 --> 00:53:15.560
And to call for backup.

701
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:17.687
I'll take care of it.

702
00:53:22.157 --> 00:53:23.772
So I go in there.

703
00:53:25.661 --> 00:53:27.026
I see a barrel.

704
00:53:30.249 --> 00:53:32.456
I amped up. I squeezed the trigger...

705
00:53:37.423 --> 00:53:39.004
And I'm just...

706
00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:44.884
Jasmine?

707
00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:51.675
Where was the guy with the gun?

708
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:55.346
There was no gun.

709
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:56.851
Hey!

710
00:53:56.942 --> 00:53:58.648
- You call this in?
- Yeah.

711
00:53:58.736 --> 00:54:00.422
You have any weapons on you. sir?
Do you have any weapons?

712
00:54:00.446 --> 00:54:03.279
This asshole just
called in a fake gun run

713
00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:07.529
'cause he figured that we were taking too
long to respond to his noise complaint.

714
00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:14.198
That's not on you. you know that.

715
00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:16.955
I know.

716
00:54:18.213 --> 00:54:21.171
But it happened to me. you know.

717
00:54:26.263 --> 00:54:28.254
I put her in that position.

718
00:54:33.562 --> 00:54:36.429
I always said I'd never
hook up with a cop.

719
00:54:38.525 --> 00:54:40.561
What. why? Because of your father?

720
00:54:40.652 --> 00:54:43.519
Yeah. I'm not really
that into kissing my dad. you know.

721
00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:46.401
Well. daddy issues. huh?

722
00:54:55.209 --> 00:54:57.416
He always wanted a boy.

723
00:55:04.885 --> 00:55:06.125
Troy.

724
00:55:08.514 --> 00:55:10.675
You really believe that?

725
00:55:14.102 --> 00:55:15.262
You met him.

726
00:55:16.271 --> 00:55:19.308
I did. Yeah.

727
00:55:19.399 --> 00:55:22.015
He's a fucking asshole. but...

728
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:24.271
I also met you...

729
00:55:25.364 --> 00:55:27.605
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't think that.

730
00:55:41.755 --> 00:55:43.620
Well done.

731
00:55:45.676 --> 00:55:48.839
You act like you've
never been shot before.

732
00:55:48.929 --> 00:55:51.170
God. you got the touch. doc.

733
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.341
All right.

734
00:55:55.435 --> 00:55:58.427
- You're good.
- Thank you.

735
00:56:06.738 --> 00:56:08.729
When we. uh. get out of here...

736
00:56:09.741 --> 00:56:11.072
Would you. um...

737
00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:15.031
Be open to...

738
00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:18.285
You know. helping me
take these stitches out?

739
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:19.978
I'm gonna need 'em out for sure.

740
00:56:20.002 --> 00:56:22.709
No. no. I'm... I'm serious. Like. uh...

741
00:56:22.796 --> 00:56:25.879
I'm... I'm very particular
when it comes to making sure

742
00:56:25.966 --> 00:56:27.877
I get my stitches out and all that.

743
00:56:27.968 --> 00:56:31.176
- Okay.
- You know. needles and such.

744
00:56:32.931 --> 00:56:34.762
Well. I am particularly good at that.

745
00:56:35.767 --> 00:56:37.007
I appreciate that.

746
00:56:38.645 --> 00:56:39.645
Anytime.

747
00:56:40.647 --> 00:56:41.682
Ah!

748
00:56:42.816 --> 00:56:44.022
Ahh!

749
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.361
Boss. you gotta see this.

750
00:57:04.296 --> 00:57:06.332
Ah. that looks nice.

751
00:57:06.423 --> 00:57:08.334
Nice uzi. that's a good one.

752
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:11.292
Have one of these.
This could be handy.

753
00:57:11.386 --> 00:57:13.092
I like this little baby here.

754
00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.011
Don't you want an m4. maybe a shotgun?

755
00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:18.340
- Don't fucking move!
- Whoa. okay.

756
00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:23.682
So this is the spot?

757
00:57:23.774 --> 00:57:25.639
Why. you asking us or telling us?

758
00:57:25.734 --> 00:57:27.599
I'm asking. fuck-face.

759
00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:30.731
- I'm just trying to clarify is all.
- Yes.

760
00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:34.860
This is the spot.

761
00:57:36.703 --> 00:57:38.159
Put your weapons on the floor.

762
00:57:39.498 --> 00:57:41.034
All right. nice and slow now.

763
00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:42.409
Make the man happy. sweetheart.

764
00:57:44.503 --> 00:57:46.915
Weapons on the floor. that's it.

765
00:57:47.005 --> 00:57:48.870
Nice and calm now.

766
00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:54.880
Okay.

767
00:57:57.849 --> 00:57:59.134
Okay?

768
00:58:10.988 --> 00:58:13.320
Jj

769
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:40.798
Ah. fuck me. Fuck!

770
00:58:46.857 --> 00:58:47.857
- Hey.
- Hey!

771
00:58:47.941 --> 00:58:49.226
Hey. nice fucking work. kid.

772
00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:51.854
I think I got a spare hole here.

773
00:58:53.613 --> 00:58:56.605
Yeah. fuck.
The old familiar part.

774
00:58:56.700 --> 00:59:00.238
Yeah. help me up.
You lie down. you die. Help me up.

775
00:59:00.328 --> 00:59:04.116
Okay. Okay.

776
00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:05.913
It's empty! It's fucking empty!

777
00:59:06.001 --> 00:59:08.492
I know it's fucking empty!
Shut the fuck up!

778
00:59:08.587 --> 00:59:10.669
Okay. The old man
knows where the art is.

779
00:59:10.756 --> 00:59:12.108
We find the old man. we find the art.

780
00:59:12.132 --> 00:59:13.542
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

781
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:19.594
You trained Janet to attack the police?

782
00:59:22.017 --> 00:59:23.302
Yeah.

783
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:26.222
Why?

784
00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.772
I was walking home from work...

785
00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:35.606
And two cops. they stop me.

786
00:59:37.866 --> 00:59:40.573
Said I match a description
of this robbery.

787
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:44.828
I know what the description was.

788
00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:47.659
Black male...

789
00:59:49.002 --> 00:59:53.211
18 to 40s. 5'6 " to 6'8".

790
00:59:53.298 --> 00:59:57.007
I've been stopped like 20 times.
and I ain't commit any robbery.

791
00:59:58.386 --> 00:59:59.967
I was sick of it.

792
01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:03.338
So I kept walking.

793
01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.348
Said a few choice words...

794
01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.973
Pushed off of one of them.

795
01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.609
Next thing I knew.
I was waking up in the hospital.

796
01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:22.862
I filed a notice of claim...

797
01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:26.657
Sued the city...

798
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.874
And got a big ass settlement
and I moved down here.

799
01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:33.869
And I rescued Janet.

800
01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:39.632
Feels like dirty money.

801
01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.886
Like I took something
that didn't belong to me.

802
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.181
You know what I mean?

803
01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:51.603
I do.

804
01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.275
I do.

805
01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.481
Okay. ray...

806
01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.693
Oh... that's a hole.

807
01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.033
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

808
01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.366
I'm sorry. it was my fucking fault.
I'm so sorry.

809
01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.898
I was trying to do something
to give us a shot.

810
01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:18.584
Shut the fuck up! Jesus.

811
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.361
You did what you had to do.
and you did good.

812
01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:22.717
- So own it. all right?
- I'm sorry.

813
01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:24.590
If we get outta this.

814
01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.297
I'll recommend you
for any damn unit you want.

815
01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.474
Except warrants. Fuck warrants.

816
01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.946
Wow. That hurts.

817
01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.524
- Are you okay?
- Okay. let's go.

818
01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:47.109
Okay.

819
01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:50.449
Jj

820
01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:59.246
We'll go floor by floor until we find him.

821
01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.924
What happened to them?

822
01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.717
Well. he's not taking a nap.

823
01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:09.180
All right. you ready?

824
01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:12.134
Not really. but hey.
what else are we gonna do?

825
01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.389
Where's my vest?

826
01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:17.814
Fat lot of good that did. huh?

827
01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.732
They don't make them
big enough. do they?

828
01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:22.644
- Thank you. sweetheart.
- Yeah.

829
01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:23.945
Let's go.

830
01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.153
Okay.

831
01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.218
Ray!

832
01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:52.056
Get up!

833
01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:53.349
Now! Get up.

834
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.766
I'll shoot you in the fucking head.

835
01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:58.642
Get up. Get up!

836
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:03.192
Move!

837
01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:27.049
Go in there. In there.

838
01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:04.921
Dad?

839
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:08.875
- Hey.
- Oh. shit.

840
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:11.586
- Hi. sweetie. Hi.
- I got this.

841
01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:15.807
I've been looking for you two all over.
Where you been?

842
01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:22.180
These clowns are pretty heavy tooled up.
You be careful. all right?

843
01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:24.503
I'd appreciate it if you could
cap a couple of them. too.

844
01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.392
Sons of bitch...

845
01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:27.728
It's okay. Shh...

846
01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:32.273
Hey. honey...

847
01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.610
Honey. don't. No. honey. stop.

848
01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:38.322
I have too many holes in me.
Just sit with me for a sec. huh?

849
01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:40.782
Just sit with me for a sec.

850
01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.243
That's it. Yeah. That's it.

851
01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.790
Good shooting.

852
01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:53.803
I saw you down there. Good work.

853
01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.892
Hold my hand. darling. Hold my hand.

854
01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:01.685
Yeah. that's good.

855
01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:11.188
Come here.

856
01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.157
Jj

857
01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.398
We gotta go.

858
01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:56.441
Um...

859
01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.538
I love you. dad.

860
01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:41.952
Hey...

861
01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.281
Will you let me know how it feels

862
01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:46.991
for a bullet to go through your skin...

863
01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:50.165
And into your brain?

864
01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:57.256
Why don't you go and fuck yourself?

865
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.442
You know where your partner is?

866
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:24.495
How about the old man?

867
01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.453
It was worth a shot.

868
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:38.089
Adam-boy-Charlie.
Over. Do you copy?

869
01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:52.436
Is it over?

870
01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.145
We're in the eye of the storm.

871
01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:07.113
Open up.

872
01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:08.414
It's safe.

873
01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:10.787
All right.

874
01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:13.544
We need weapons.

875
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.747
Guns. knives. anything that kills.

876
01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.570
Hey. we're in the fucking
same boat now. huh. Griffin?

877
01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:20.085
Yeah. And your father?

878
01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:28.510
It was getting real dark
in here for a minute.

879
01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:32.438
Are you okay?

880
01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:40.772
We should get out of here.

881
01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.489
Poppy flowers.

882
01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:50.577
Vincent Van gogh. $55 million.

883
01:08:50.668 --> 01:08:53.375
It's here in this building.

884
01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.376
Officer cardillo.

885
01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:06.722
This is cardillo.

886
01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.972
I'm here with your partner. officer pena.

887
01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.638
Is she okay?

888
01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:17.187
Say hello.

889
01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.854
I'm okay. I'm okay. cardillo.

890
01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:27.489
I'm sure you can see.
we've hit a lull in the storm.

891
01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:32.244
Which gives us about 15 minutes
to finish our business

892
01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:33.916
and safely exit.

893
01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:37.166
I would suggest.
for officer pena's sake.

894
01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.089
that you refrain from calling for backup.

895
01:09:45.431 --> 01:09:47.046
Officer cardillo.

896
01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:52.430
I haven't called.

897
01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:55.980
Then I'll keep this simple for expediency.

898
01:09:56.067 --> 01:10:00.151
I want you. the old man and the art.

899
01:10:11.999 --> 01:10:13.535
I can't finish this here.

900
01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:17.452
- What is it?
- He's bleeding out.

901
01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:19.287
I gotta get him to a hospital. now.

902
01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:21.665
Officer?

903
01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:28.637
You can have me and the art...

904
01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.928
But you have to release officer pena.

905
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:39.186
That's so cliché. So cliché.

906
01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:41.438
You know. I figured
you were the smart one.

907
01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:43.778
Oh...

908
01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:45.856
Come to apartment 44a.

909
01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:48.816
Leave your guns.

910
01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:51.306
If you're not here in five minutes.
I'll execute your partner

911
01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:53.321
and throw her out the fucking window.

912
01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:56.658
Don't make the same mistake
you made in New York.

913
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.001
How do you know about that?

914
01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:06.710
I know everything.
I'm John the baptist.

915
01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:21.308
Where are they?

916
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.191
Where the fuck are they?

917
01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:31.242
- I... don't know.
- Don't you fucking lie to me.

918
01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:35.203
They came here looking for you.

919
01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.536
Did you hear what
he said they're gonna do?

920
01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:40.789
They're gonna fucking kill pena.

921
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.836
and then they're gonna hunt us down.

922
01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:46.378
This storm is gonna start back up.

923
01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:47.925
and then we're gonna be trapped.

924
01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.964
They'll be shooting fish
in a fucking barrel.

925
01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:08.779
They have been in my family since the war.

926
01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:13.075
- Are you a Nazi?
- No.

927
01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:19.949
My father was.

928
01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:26.172
And he passed these paintings to me.

929
01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.006
That's blood money.

930
01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:35.305
Are they in the building?

931
01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.429
Are they in the fucking building?

932
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:39.977
Tell him!

933
01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:50.021
Two minutes.

934
01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:57.032
Here. Take this.

935
01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:59.079
- Why?
- You're gonna need it.

936
01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:00.531
What about you?

937
01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.537
We're gonna go on up there
and finish this.

938
01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.619
- Okay.
- I know you know how to shoot.

939
01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:11.338
You get out when you can.
Both of you.

940
01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:13.631
Hey...

941
01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:21.598
Don't take the scaffolding.

942
01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:27.525
Yeah.

943
01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:37.743
All right. buddy. Let's go.

944
01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:41.247
Okay.

945
01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:42.334
Come on.

946
01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.454
We gotta keep moving. Come on.

947
01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:49.088
Jj

948
01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:07.766
- I can't.
- Hey.

949
01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.816
- I can't.
- Come on.

950
01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.365
One minute.

951
01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:35.801
Where is it?

952
01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.385
- Let her go first.
- I don't think so.

953
01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:41.340
Where is it?

954
01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.891
Jj

955
01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:11.329
Come on. forward.

956
01:15:11.424 --> 01:15:13.506
Open that door. slowly.

957
01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:18.423
Slowly.

958
01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:27.270
You moved it all in here. huh?

959
01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:32.066
Ray was the only person that I trusted.

960
01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:34.272
It's that way.

961
01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:47.619
After you.

962
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:51.373
And if there's anything other than art
on the other side of that door...

963
01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.459
Yeah. I know.

964
01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:04.966
Go in.

965
01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.946
Jj

966
01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.790
Don't!

967
01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:20.129
Please... take the paintings down.

968
01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.014
Let me get the keys to your Van.

969
01:17:31.105 --> 01:17:33.892
- No. not my ride.
- Give me the keys to your Van.

970
01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:39.773
A little jumpy.

971
01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:44.152
Take off your uniform.

972
01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:48.239
I just met you.

973
01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.321
Yeah. we're gonna get a lot closer now.

974
01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.575
All right...

975
01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.285
Hey. You got this?

976
01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:03.045
I et's have a moment.

977
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.637
Contessa's back.

978
01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:16.354
Are you satisfied?

979
01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:18.103
All right. shut the fuck up.

980
01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:21.185
I don't know.

981
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.862
I love the duck room.

982
01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:30.243
Decoys. right?

983
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.410
Decoys!

984
01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:49.801
These are decoys?

985
01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:54.936
Does that look like
a fucking masterpiece to you?

986
01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.807
No. You want the real shit?

987
01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:01.267
Old man Nazi fuck.

988
01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:03.648
he hid them in other people's apartments.

989
01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:11.660
Just hiding them... right in plain sight.

990
01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:18.750
Yeah.

991
01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.166
Let's go find them.

992
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:26.375
Well. you got a way with words.

993
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.756
- I'll give you that.
- Come.

994
01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.051
- We're cool.
- Don't worry.

995
01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:34.599
- I'm gonna let you shoot him.
- Okay.

996
01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:42.190
It's okay.

997
01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:45.819
It's okay.

998
01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:19.770
Ah!

999
01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:45.751
If there's water coming in.
there's a way out.

1000
01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:48.669
Come on. let's do this.

1001
01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:51.218
What... shit.

1002
01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:58.430
The old man talked his way
into all these apartments?

1003
01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.226
Yeah. he owned the building.

1004
01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.263
Not anymore.

1005
01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.549
Oh. my god.

1006
01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:37.381
This is the crown Jewel.

1007
01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:40.221
The concert.

1008
01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:43.186
Johannes vermeer.

1009
01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.356
Isabella Stewart gardner

1010
01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:52.154
bought this painting at an auction
in Paris in 1892 for $5.000.

1011
01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:58.403
And now it has
an estimated worth... 200 million.

1012
01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:03.039
Art sucks.

1013
01:22:06.213 --> 01:22:07.373
Take it down.

1014
01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:15.882
Hey. Carefully.

1015
01:22:36.243 --> 01:22:39.531
Okay. Okay. Hey. look at me.

1016
01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:42.738
Look at me. We're gonna be okay.
We're not gonna die.

1017
01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:44.164
- Okay.
- Okay?

1018
01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:46.569
There's gotta be a way out of here.

1019
01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:49.870
Hey. hey. This... hold this light.

1020
01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.626
- What are you doing?
- I'm going down.

1021
01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:53.653
Point the light down.
I'm going to find a way out.

1022
01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:56.214
Okay. One. two. three.

1023
01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:08.560
Oh. shit.

1024
01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:23.905
Jj

1025
01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:26.532
What's in there?

1026
01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:29.580
I don't know. Nothing.

1027
01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:34.248
That's a lot of locks for nothing.

1028
01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:35.549
Open the door.

1029
01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:51.853
Hey. hey. hey.

1030
01:23:52.945 --> 01:23:54.310
Anything?

1031
01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:57.111
- Oh. shit.
- I got you. I got you.

1032
01:23:57.199 --> 01:23:59.235
Okay.

1033
01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:00.361
Oh...

1034
01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:02.238
- Anything?
- I found it.

1035
01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:04.160
Take my... take it.

1036
01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:06.614
- Okay.
- Okay. We're gonna get outta here.

1037
01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:09.074
Here we go. One. two. three...

1038
01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:27.476
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Open it!

1039
01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.104
All right.

1040
01:24:32.693 --> 01:24:34.149
Suit yourself.

1041
01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:15.311
Knock. knock.

1042
01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:18.443
How we holding up there. sir?

1043
01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:20.945
You doing all right?

1044
01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.691
I'm thankful to be alive.

1045
01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.695

not far from here.

Who woulda thought...

1050
01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:46.666
That I'd be this happy to see
a cop walk through them doors?
