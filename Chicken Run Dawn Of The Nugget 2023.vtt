00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:20.291
Steady. mate. Steady.

171
00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:22.958
[voice breaking] But I've never had
a family of me own.

172
00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:24.083
Me neither.

173

-[both crying hysterically]
-[Rocky sighs]

174
00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:31.291
Mum. I was thinking. Can we go over there?

175
00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:32.250
Where. love?

176
00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:34.208
The other side of the water.

[sinister music fades]

181
00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:46.833
Oh. we've spoken about this. Molly.

182
00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:49.416
-There's nothing over there for us.
-[bright music playing]

183
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.458
What about stuff Uncle Nick
and Fetch bring?

184
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:53.875
Isn't that for us?

185
00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.583
Hey. What's up. Ginge?

186
00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:57.500
Rocky. [takes a deep breath]

187
00:07:57.583 --> 00:08:01.375
Molly's asking about going off the island.

188
00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:02.375
Oh. right.

189
00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:04.416
Oh. right.

190
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.291
[inhales] Hey. Molly.

191
00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:09.041
Do you wanna see
the world's coolest invention?

192
00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:11.166
[Molly] Hmm. [sighs]

193
00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:13.791
Okay.

-[cap sizzling]
-What is it. Dad?

197
00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:25.500
Only the answer to all of life's problems.

198
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:27.875
Popcorn. [sighs]

199
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.125
[crunches] Mm!

200
00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:34.250
-Is that the best thing ever or what?
-[tender orchestral music playing]

201
00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:37.916
-Mm! It is good.
-[scoffs] "Good"?

202
00:08:38.416 --> 00:08:40.000
This is great!

203
00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:41.875
-[Rocky chuckles]
-[Ginger sighs happily]

204
00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:46.458

-[Molly] Mum. what is it?
-It's nothing to worry about. Molly.

211
00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:08.416
Nothing at all.

212
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.458
[chainsaws buzzing]

00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:19.375
[ominous music fades]

217
00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:26.000
Well. it was only a matter of time
before the humans showed up.

218
00:09:26.083 --> 00:09:27.333
[ominous music resumes]

219
00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:28.791
[chickens clucking in truck]

220
00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:32.791
[Ginger] It looks like they're taking them
to some kind of chicken farm.

221
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.041
-[uplifting music playing]
-Uh-oh.

222
00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:40.166
I haven't seen that look in a long while.

223
00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.791
You can't right
all the world's wrongs. duck.

224
00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:47.416
Meeting tonight. Spread the word.

225
00:09:47.916 --> 00:09:50.166
[tuts] Here we go again.

226
00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:55.416
-[indistinct. excited chatter]
-[energetic instrumental music playing]

227
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.125
-[footsteps approach]
-[Molly] What's going on. Mum?

228
00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:01.958
Why can't I go up my tree anymore?
What's this meeting about?

229
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:04.125
It's nothing. Molly.

230
00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:06.416
It's. um. just…

231
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.875
There's some quite big wasps
up there this year.

232
00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.666
[sighs] Really?

233
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.083
Besides. I need someone to stay here
and look after your dad.

234
00:10:16.166 --> 00:10:17.333
[grunts]

235
00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:18.916
[yells. strains]

[yelps. groans]

237
00:10:21.375 --> 00:10:23.375
Don't worry. I'm good.

238
00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:25.416
[giggles] Okay.

239
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:28.708
Maybe while you're out.
he can tell me a story.

240
00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:29.875
Good idea.

241
00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:33.083
Good night. my big. brave girl.

242
00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:36.791

-[Molly giggles]
-[Rocky] Good night. Ginge. Good luck.

244
00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:43.333
Okay. Mollypod. What do you wanna do?

245
00:10:43.416 --> 00:10:49.041
Well. I thought
you could tell me about… this.

246
00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:51.833
Oh! [chuckles sheepishly]

247
00:10:51.916 --> 00:10:56.291
Uh. uh. uh. that… that is… not me.

248
00:10:56.375 --> 00:10:58.375
[whimsical music playing]

249
00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:07.625
Okay. Yes. it's me.
But it was a long time ago.

250
00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:09.875
And?

251
00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:11.375
And.

252
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.750
actually.

253
00:11:14.666 --> 00:11:17.291
it's a… it's a pretty good story.

254
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:19.166
[chickens chattering inside]

255
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.083
[hen 1] It's not just eggs
they want from us.

256
00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:23.083
[Bunty] Ginger has that look about her.

257
00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:26.416
I reckon she'll have us charging
right into the fray.

258
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.000
I don't want to charge into any frays.

259
00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:30.500
I… I'm fray-phobic.

260
00:11:30.583 --> 00:11:34.416
-All right. everyone! Please. quiet!
-[hen 2] Wait. She's starting.

261
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.250
-[Ginger] Quiet!
-[hen 2] Shut your beak.

262
00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:39.750
-[chatter dies down]
-Now. we all know about the new road.

263
00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.041
-[tense music playing]
-[chickens murmuring]

264
00:11:42.125 --> 00:11:47.083
And the trucks taking chickens
to what looks like some kind of farm.

265
00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:49.333
A farm? [clucks nervously]

266
00:11:49.416 --> 00:11:51.916
No. it's all right. Beryl. Listen. Listen.

267
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.208
We know from experience
what that can mean.

268
00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:56.125
[yelps]

269
00:11:56.208 --> 00:11:58.791
It's something we just can't ignore.

270
00:11:58.875 --> 00:11:59.958
[tense music building]

271
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:02.875
We really only have one choice.

272
00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.000
[shudders] I don't want to hear it.

273
00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:06.708
We've got to do something.

274
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:08.125
-[chickens clamoring]
-[chomps]

275
00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:09.541
[music stops suddenly]

276
00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:11.125
We have to hide.

277
00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:12.791
-[Babs] Ah?
-[chickens] Huh?

278
00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:14.083
[hen 3 gulps]

279
00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:15.833
Hide?

280
00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:17.708
Yes. Hide!

281
00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:20.583
-[wing pops free]
-You mean. pretend we're not here?

282
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.166
Exactly.

283
00:12:22.666 --> 00:12:24.541
[uneasy string music playing]

284
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.583
-[chickens cheering]
-[music grows triumphant]

285
00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:34.833
Operation Lie Low. Jolly good.

286
00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:38.250
Ooh! I like lilos.
Especially the stripy ones.

287
00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:39.500
She's right. you know.

288
00:12:39.583 --> 00:12:41.958
-It's really not our problem.
-[hen 4 laughs] Oh. you!

289
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:43.708
Are you all right. hen?

290
00:12:44.416 --> 00:12:47.083
It's not like you to shy away from danger.

291
00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:51.000
I know. but I have Molly
to think about now.

292
00:12:51.083 --> 00:12:52.083
And I…

293
00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:54.375
We can't risk our freedom

294
00:12:54.458 --> 00:12:57.583
by venturing into a world
that finds chickens so…

295
00:12:59.333 --> 00:13:00.458
delicious.

296
00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:05.666
-[hens panting]
-[energetic orchestral music playing]

297
00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:09.958

-[orchestral music swells. fades]
-[frog croaks]

302
00:13:19.583 --> 00:13:21.000
[Ginger] Right.

303
00:13:21.083 --> 00:13:25.333
All we have to do now is keep quiet
and not draw attention to ourselves.

304
00:13:25.416 --> 00:13:29.250
-[loudly] Cock-a-doodle-doo!

307
00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:35.083
[Ginger. hushed] Rocky!

308
00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:41.333
Um. given our new situation.
maybe you shouldn't crow anymore.

309
00:13:41.416 --> 00:13:44.000
[exhales. coughs]

310
00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:45.791
[gasps] Don't crow?

311
00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:48.416
[chuckles] What?
But that's. like. my thing.

312
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.958
Maybe you could do a different thing.

313
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:52.041
A quieter one?

314
00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:53.875
[Molly] Wow! Look at this!

315
00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.708
Molly! Get away from that.

316
00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:59.333
-Ginge. can we talk about the whole…
-[Fowler] She's right. you know.

317
00:13:59.416 --> 00:14:00.625
[tense music plays]

318
00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:04.666
-[yelps]
-Careless squawks cost lives.

319
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.458
We have to lie low.

320
00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.750
I'm running a camouflage lesson at noon.

321
00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:12.708
If you can find me.

322
00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:15.791
-[Fowler yelps]
-[hens] Ooh.

323
00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.583
[Molly] What's it for. Mum?

324
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.583
[chickens clucking inside truck]

325
00:14:23.666 --> 00:14:26.166
[gasps] Oh! What is that?

326
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.916
[chickens clucking loudly]

327
00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:31.500
It's got a chicken sitting
in a bucket on it.

328
00:14:31.583 --> 00:14:33.333
It's doing this.

329
00:14:33.416 --> 00:14:35.375
[giggles] Oh. that's so funny.

330
00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.791
Uh. let's go home.

331
00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:39.666
[Molly sighs]

332
00:14:40.416 --> 00:14:41.458
[chuckles softly]

333
00:14:42.458 --> 00:14:45.000
Where are they going?
[gasps] Can we go with them?

334
00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:47.333
-It looks like a lot of fun.
-I'm sorry. Molly.

335
00:14:47.416 --> 00:14:49.791
-You're not ready to go off the island.
-But I…

336
00:14:49.875 --> 00:14:52.458
Uh. Rocky? Little help?

337
00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:54.916
Maybe I could crow on weekends. Y'know?

338
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.375
Why am I not ready?

339
00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:57.750
I'm a big. brave girl.

340
00:14:57.833 --> 00:15:00.000
-You always say so.
-I know.

341
00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:01.708

Says me and your dad.

344
00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:06.541
Right. Rocky?

345
00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:09.958
Yeah. that's right. That's right. Yes.
Listen to your mom. kiddo.

346
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:13.958
Oh! Oh. How about just half a crow?
Like a "cock-a" or "doodle-doo"?

347
00:15:14.041 --> 00:15:15.500
Something that's a little shorter.

348
00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:20.833
Well. I'm going over to see those trucks
because I am a Lone Free Ranger.

349
00:15:20.916 --> 00:15:22.166
Like Dad was.

Ah.

353
00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:28.416

That's it.

357
00:15:35.458 --> 00:15:37.875
Molly. you are not leaving this island.

358
00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.833
You can't make me stay here.
You're not the boss of me.

359
00:15:40.916 --> 00:15:43.083
Actually. I am.

360
00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:48.458
Look. Molly. you've got
everything you want right here.

361
00:15:48.541 --> 00:15:50.583
Except for one thing.

362
00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:51.958

363

Isn't it a bit late
for you to be out. baby girl?

Molly.

421
00:18:34.791 --> 00:18:36.750
[sighs] Although.
it's kind of a goofy name.

422
00:18:36.833 --> 00:18:38.416
So I'm thinking of changing it to…

423
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.458
Zip it. kidda.

424
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:42.625

00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:48.916
To the happy chicken truck.

427
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.791
[gasps] You've seen them too?

428
00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:52.333
Right.

Wherever that truck's goin'.

431
00:18:55.708 --> 00:18:58.958
it's gonna be cooler
than a penguin's toenails.

432
00:18:59.541 --> 00:19:02.083
Uh. what's a toenail?

433
00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:04.041
What's a penguin?

434
00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:08.041
Oh! You have got so much to learn.
Come on.

435
00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.875
[sighs] Wait for me!

436
00:19:12.666 --> 00:19:15.916
I mean. so she found my poster.
and I told her a story.

437
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.291
I don't think that's such a big deal.

438
00:19:18.375 --> 00:19:21.541
Oh no. It was perfectly sensible
to encourage our daughter

439
00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:23.375
to be a Lone Free Ranger.

440
00:19:23.458 --> 00:19:26.041
You know. if you had it your way.
she'd still be in her shell.

441
00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:29.041
Well. better in her shell
than out on the open road.

442
00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:32.666
So. do you live on an island too?

443
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.833
Nah. I was stuck on a boring old farm.

444
00:19:35.916 --> 00:19:39.208
Then the trucks came.
and they said I was too small to go.

445
00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:40.750
But that's not gonna stop me.

446
00:19:40.833 --> 00:19:42.625
You get to sit in a bucket.

447
00:19:43.125 --> 00:19:45.333
What chicken doesn't want
their own bucket?

448
00:19:45.416 --> 00:19:47.250
I want a bucket.

449
00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:48.708
The thing about us. Mol.

450
00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:52.458
is that we wanna go
where we wanna go whenever we want.

451
00:19:52.541 --> 00:19:55.875
Yeah. With nobody telling us
what we can and can't do.

452
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.625

You've never seen a human before?

463
00:20:26.083 --> 00:20:28.041
We had them back at the farm.

464

[quietly] They're kinda stupid.

465
00:20:30.166 --> 00:20:33.708

They're basically like waitin' staff.

We mustn't panic.

521

-No. No panicking.
-I don't like it.

522
00:23:18.166 --> 00:23:21.625
It's a perfect time to panic.
The enemy has the upper hand.

523
00:23:21.708 --> 00:23:23.208
We must keep our heads!

524
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:25.958

I say. last time.
we broke out of a chicken farm.

528
00:23:39.333 --> 00:23:42.708

562

Listen. everyone. We can do this.

563
00:25:17.791 --> 00:25:20.458
-We just need a really clever plan.
-Ooh. Ooh.

564
00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:22.291
Okay. I've got this. I've got this.

565
00:25:23.291 --> 00:25:28.333
[slowly] I'm gonna go in there.
and I'm gonna bust Molly out.

566
00:25:28.833 --> 00:25:31.791
And just how the bloomin' heck
are you going to do that?

567
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:37.500
Well. by. uh… uh. y'know. going in there

568
00:25:37.583 --> 00:25:40.000
and then… busting her out.

569
00:25:41.041 --> 00:25:42.958
That's not a plan.

570
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:45.083
That's just saying
what you wish would happen.

571
00:25:45.166 --> 00:25:46.916
Aye. and 12 herrings and a bagpipe

572
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.166
are just a pile of mince
if you havnae kent the rules.

573
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.791
You know.
that sounded a little negative to me.

574
00:25:52.875 --> 00:25:55.250
Mac's right. We need more details.

575
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.625
We only get one shot at this.
so we need to make sure

576
00:25:58.708 --> 00:26:02.291
that every move we make
is carefully thought through.

577
00:26:02.375 --> 00:26:04.000

[gulls calling]

620

Uh. shouldn't it be the other way around?

625

[sighs] Don't be a 'nana. Fetch.

626
00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.083
I know it looks
like a million-to-one shot.

627

but we know the layout.
and Mac thinks there's a way in.

628

Oh!

630

Uh. thanks. Babs.

632
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.250
There's a wee side door in a blind spot.

633

Please. You've got to help us.
Rocky's in there.

640

Nick and Fetch.

655
00:29:23.375 --> 00:29:26.500

Oh. [sniffles]

657

-You're too kind.
-[chuckles] Flatterer.

[snoring]

661
00:29:38.458 --> 00:29:43.125
Ooh. [splutters] And then the second wave
of bombers approach the target.

662
00:29:43.208 --> 00:29:45.083
and that's where I come in.

663
00:29:46.125 --> 00:29:50.375
Actually. Fowler.
we need to find something special for you.

664

-Ah. right.

Hmm. [clicks tongue] Sounds important.

I like it.

669
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.333
Right. Let's gather what we need
and hurry.

670
00:30:06.833 --> 00:30:09.458
Who knows what horrors
Molly is dealing with in there.

[scoffs] Yeah. right.

679

Are the streets paved
with marshmallows where you live?

680
00:30:29.958 --> 00:30:31.791
Can ya bounce on them?

681
00:30:31.875 --> 00:30:35.125

[control panel beeps]

1052

That's a clever little cartoon. Dr. Fry.

1053

Hello. Reginald.

I see you've met
my current husband. Dr. Fry.

1070
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:11.666
Was I attracted to his large inheritance
and vast acres of land?

1071
00:50:12.166 --> 00:50:15.875
No. it was his mind.

1072
00:50:15.958 --> 00:50:20.666
You probably can't tell
by looking at him. but he's a genius.

1073
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:22.375
You flatter me. darling. [chuckles]

01:03:30.916 --> 01:03:31.875
Where's Rocky?

1392
01:03:31.958 --> 01:03:33.708
I saw him back in that big room.

1393
01:03:33.791 --> 01:03:35.541
[sighs] He saved us.

1394
01:03:36.166 --> 01:03:37.416
He did?

1395
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.875

1398
01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:46.791
[grunts] Huh?

1399
01:03:47.625 --> 01:03:48.750
Oh!

1400
01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:51.708
-[all straining]
-Come on. We can do it this time.

1401
01:03:51.791 --> 01:03:54.666
I can't hold this much longer.

1402
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.500
Fetcher. quickly!

1403
01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:59.041
Find a ledge or a crack to grab hold of!

1404
01:03:59.125 --> 01:04:00.083
[Fetcher] Righto.

1405
01:04:00.666 --> 01:04:02.500
Ooh! Not that crack.

1406

[all groan]

1409
01:04:08.666 --> 01:04:11.750
[sighs] Face the facts. duck.

1410
01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:14.291
We need a miracle to get out of here.

1411
01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:16.833
-[Rocky] Hey! Anyone down there?
-[Ginger gasps]

1412
01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:18.041
-[Molly] Dad!
-[Ginger] Rocky!

1413
01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:22.041
[laughs] Do not tell him he's our miracle.
There'll be no living with him.

1414
01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:24.166
Rocky is on the case.

1415
01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:26.500
[group] No! Don't jump!

1416
01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:28.416
-[group shouting]
-What? What's that?

1417
01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.208
I can't hear you! Wait. I'm comin' down!

1418
01:04:31.291 --> 01:04:32.458
Don't jump!

1419
01:04:32.541 --> 01:04:33.625
[Rocky yells]

1420
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.708
-Oh! Family hug!
-[Molly gasps. grunts]

1421
01:04:40.791 --> 01:04:42.625
Oh. I missed you guys.

1422
01:04:42.708 --> 01:04:46.541
Okay. Well. let's blow this henhouse
and head home.

[wind billows]

1424
01:04:52.416 --> 01:04:53.375
Ah.

1425
01:04:54.708 --> 01:04:56.291
That's the way out. isn't it?

1426
01:04:57.291 --> 01:04:58.208
[Ginger chuckles]

1427
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.125
I am so sorry.

1428
01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:02.708
[Molly crying]

1429
01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:04.791
[somber orchestral music playing]

1430
01:05:08.833 --> 01:05:10.041
[Molly sobbing]

1431
01:05:10.125 --> 01:05:12.583
Molly. what's wrong?

1432
01:05:12.666 --> 01:05:14.333
This is all my fault.

1433
01:05:14.833 --> 01:05:18.666
I should have listened to you
and done what I was told.

1434
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:20.958
Now everything is a mess.

1435
01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:29.208
[sighs] Hey. where's my big. brave girl?

1436
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:31.791
[sighs] That girl's stupid.

1437
01:05:32.708 --> 01:05:34.000
You were right.

1438
01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:38.708
If we ever get home. I'll just stay there
and never leave. Ever.

1439
01:05:39.208 --> 01:05:40.916
Hey. no. Molly.

1440
01:05:41.416 --> 01:05:42.791
This is my fault.

1441
01:05:43.291 --> 01:05:48.958
I should not have told you all
of that ridiculous Lone Free Ranger stuff.

1442
01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:52.916
No. this is on me.

1443
01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:55.916
I used to hate being fenced in.

1444
01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:59.083
So why did I expect you
to be any different?

1445
01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:02.875
I guess I was afraid
you were so much like me.

1446
01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:06.333
What's wrong with being like you?

1447
01:06:11.958 --> 01:06:13.000
Nothing.

1448
01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:15.833
-Because your mom is the best.
-[sighs]

1449
01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:19.083
And she always has a plan.

1450
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:22.041
Not this time.

01:06:22.583 --> 01:06:23.750
[tense music playing]

1452
01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:25.583
[sighs] He's here.

[Fry murmuring nervously]

1454
01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:29.708
-Are we ready to fry. Fry?
-[buttons beeping]

1455
01:06:29.791 --> 01:06:31.375
Five minutes. pumpkin. [chuckles]

1456
01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:33.541
-Make it four.
-[Fry. shakily] Oh.

1457
01:06:33.625 --> 01:06:35.250
Where is she?

1458
01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:36.583
-[bell dings]
-Hmm?

1459
01:06:36.666 --> 01:06:41.083
Them runaway chickens. uh.
have got themselves stuck in a corn silo.

1460
01:06:41.708 --> 01:06:43.708
In the silo. you say?

1461
01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:47.166
Excellent. I'll go and greet our guest.

1462
01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:49.416
Production starts in three minutes.

1463
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.875
[splutters] Three? [yelps]

1464
01:06:50.958 --> 01:06:55.041
Looks like you've just run out of cluck.

[family] Huh?

1468
01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:05.125
[Rocky] Huh?

1469
01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:06.750
Huh?

1470
01:07:06.833 --> 01:07:08.166
[Babs whines]

1471
01:07:11.208 --> 01:07:13.666
I think there's a grinder
at the bottom of this thing.

1472
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:16.625
On the plus side. though.
we will all probably drown

1473
01:07:16.708 --> 01:07:18.666
before we're ground into tiny. wee pieces.

1474
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:20.500
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

1475
01:07:20.583 --> 01:07:22.333
Popcorn. [chuckles nervously]

1476
01:07:22.416 --> 01:07:25.208
Popcorn. everyone. Look.
Look. popcorn. [laughs]

1477
01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:28.250
Rocky. I don't think this is the time to…

1478
01:07:30.625 --> 01:07:31.958
Ah.

1479
01:07:32.041 --> 01:07:33.750
[bright music playing]

1480
01:07:33.833 --> 01:07:36.583
The answer to all life's problems.

1481
01:07:36.666 --> 01:07:37.708
Of course.

1482
01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:39.916
Mac. we need heat.

1483
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.625
-Lots of it.
-[Mac] Oh.

1484
01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:43.833
Will this work? [grunts]

1485
01:07:43.916 --> 01:07:45.708
[grunts] Perfect.

1486
01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:48.541
[grunts] Now. does anyone have a match?

1487
01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:51.000
Yeah. you and a raving lunatic.

1488

-You'll blow us all to bits.
-[Molly gasps]

1489
01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:59.458
Besides. we've used the last one.

1490
01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.375
Oh no.

[suspenseful music playing]

1494
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.041
Um. can I once again raise
my health and safety concerns?

1495
01:08:20.625 --> 01:08:21.458
What is it?

-[both] Huh?
-[rumbling and popping]

1498
01:08:28.958 --> 01:08:30.000
All right.

1499
01:08:33.083 --> 01:08:34.041
Oh!

1500

[alarm blaring]

1501
01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:38.541
Mm. That tastes nice.

1502
01:08:38.625 --> 01:08:39.958
Is there any more?

1503
01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:41.708
[all scream]

1504
01:08:50.833 --> 01:08:52.125
[Fowler] But guess what?

1505
01:08:52.208 --> 01:08:55.916
Just as Whizzbang Charlie
thought we were back in Blighty.

-Ye gods. It's raining popcorn?

1508

Good old British weather.

1509
01:09:03.875 --> 01:09:04.958
Unpredictable.

1510
01:09:05.041 --> 01:09:06.458

-Look.
-[Fetcher] Whoo-hoo!

1522
01:09:25.958 --> 01:09:29.750

-[bright music playing]
-Well done. you old sausage.

1524

Firm handshake will do. thank you.

1525
01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:41.708
[laughs] Mission accomplished.
Now let's fly this crazy coop. huh?

1526
01:09:42.208 --> 01:09:43.208
[Babs] Oh yes.

1527
01:09:43.291 --> 01:09:45.416
[group chattering excitedly]

1528

[Fetcher] Oh. look. Nick.

1529

[tender instrumental music playing]

1546
01:10:38.958 --> 01:10:44.375
Just because where we live is cut off
from the world doesn't mean we are too.

1547

No chicken is an island.

[Rocky] Hmm.

1549
01:10:53.375 --> 01:10:55.166
We are with you. Ginger.

Oh. well. I didn't think you…

Hey. Molly. um.

-[guard grunts. thuds]
-Sounded like an explosion.

has blown its top.
