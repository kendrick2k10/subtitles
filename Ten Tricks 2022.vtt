3
00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.019
- This is my last trick.

4
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.989
Watch carefully. when I'm done.
I'll tell you how it works.

5
00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.573
- Right now around the world.

6
00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:44.744
there are about 80
million people. fucking.

7
00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.281
Some of them are even
getting pregnant.

8
00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:52.185
Which is what I'm trying
to do myself. tonight.

9
00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:00.659
You know. when you undress
a woman with your eyes.

10
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.995
that's just half the story.

11
00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.663
'Cause once the
woman says "Yes."

12
00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:07.466
and we do more often
than you think.

13
00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.503
it's the woman who sooner
or later sees a man naked.

14
00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.605
I'll put it on your tab.

15
00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.076
And I don't mean buck naked. I
mean what's beneath the skin.

16
00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.878
behind your eyes.
inside your heart.

17
00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:23.049
It's a whole lot more
complicated than just plain fucking.

18
00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:30.189
Funny thing is. it's not the
sex you come here for. is it?

19
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.590
It's something else.

20
00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.259
- One!

21
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.065
- I know you.

22
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.000
You're that comedian.

23
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:15.167
- Ah. yeah.

24
00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.202
- You're funny.
You're really funny.

25
00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.104
Uh. thanks.

26
00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:19.939
- Can you?

27
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.674
Could you?

28
00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:24.344
Never mind.

29
00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:25.611
- Oh. what?

30
00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.746
- Could you do that
thing thing you do?

31
00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:28.881
- Oh.

32
00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:29.949
I'd rather not.

33
00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.018
- Okay.

34
00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.188
- Unless. you know. you
wanna give me a little...

35
00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.489
- What?

36
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.892
- A little discount.

37
00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.994
- You want me to
give you a discount

38
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.196
just because you do
some stupid joke?

39
00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.531
Well. you're the one who wanted.

40
00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:48.300
- Oh come. you won't just do it?

41
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.202
- Oh God.

42
00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.406
Okay.

43
00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:58.978
Okay.

44
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.081
- Hubba Bubba Dubba!

45
00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:09.322
- All the dumb things men do
to get laid. like talking.

46
00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.657
You wanna be sexy?

47
00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.125
Just shut up.

48
00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.093
Otherwise you run the risk
of telling us too much

49
00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:17.129
about your mother. or your wife.

50
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.564
Don't get me wrong.

51
00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:20.632
gettin' laid is what
makes the world go 'round.

52
00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.802
It's an absolute
necessity for my business.

53
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.372
Hey. who's wearing
too much aftershave?

54
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.041
- What did you order?

55
00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.275
You must have some wine.

56
00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.544
This is my favorite.
1987 Chateau Margaux.

57
00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.613
I'll buy you a case.
send it to your house!

58
00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:39.285
Oh.

59
00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.027
I see the people walking by.

60
00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.866
- I got a stand-up
routine for you.

61
00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:55.835
- Really?

62
00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.237
- You betcha. you wanna hear it?

63
00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.940
- I kinda rather
you just show me.

64
00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:02.742
- Okay.

65
00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.276
You got the money?

66
00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.245
- Well. I thought you were
gon' give me a discount?

67
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.479
- For what?

68
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.414
- You know. the
hubba hubba stuff.

69
00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.782
- Oh. we didn't discuss that.

70
00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:12.284
- Oh yeah we did.

71
00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:15.821
Remember I specifically asked
if you'd give me a discount.

72
00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:17.156
- Did I agree to the terms?

73
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.491
- Terms?

74
00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.892
- Did I agree. either
verbally or on paper

75
00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:23.228
to provide you with a discount?

76
00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.331
Okay. how much?

77
00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:27.166
- 500.

78
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.102
- I can't believe you're
gon' charge me that much.

79
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.570
- How much do you think
these things usually cost?

80
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:35.875
- Look. what if I. say. gave
you. my. say. autograph?

81
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.079
- How much is that worth?

82
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.782
- I dunno. 400 or so.

83
00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:44.617
- Dollars?

84
00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:45.917
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.887
- Your autograph isn't
not worth that much.

86
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.092
You don't think I'm
worth 500 measly dollars?

87
00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.227
- I'm sure you are-
- Just because you're

88
00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:56.728
some big-shot
celebrity. been on TV.

89
00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:57.664
makes you any better
than me. okay?

90
00:04:57.665 --> 00:04:58.930
Well. No one said-

91
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.198
- I should charge you
extra. for the insult.

92
00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.334
- Look. I'm going home.

93
00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:04.203
- Fine.

94
00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:07.440
Your loss. buddy.

95
00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:11.110
- Somehow I'll survive.

96
00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:15.013
- You know. you're a
very disturbed person.

97
00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:16.281
- What?

98
00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.116
- That's why you come
to see people like me.

99
00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:20.085
- Oh. you my therapist now?

100
00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:21.520
- Otherwise. you'd
have a girlfriend.

101
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:24.557
- Well. for your information.
I do have a girlfriend.

102
00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.593
- And you're cheating on her?

103
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.829
With me?

104
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.030
Oh my God!

105
00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:33.432
- You really are
nuts. you know that?

106
00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:34.734
- What did you say?

107
00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.303
- You are. You are really crazy.

108
00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:44.276
- I'm not crazy.

109
00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.111
- You get out of the way.

110
00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:46.045
- You take that back.

111
00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:46.813
- You get away from that door!

112
00:05:46.814 --> 00:05:48.380
- No.

113
00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:52.584
The women.

114
00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:54.020
Mostly the women.

115
00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:56.355
Wooh!

116
00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:02.194
And in the morning. their hair
still wet from the shower.

117
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.830
the women. so beautiful
and naked in their shower

118
00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:06.465
I live through
you. you know that.

119
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.577
Oww!

120
00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:23.782
- Hubba Bubba!

121
00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:24.951
Oh my God.

122
00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.286
- Another fucking birthday.

123
00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:29.621
Feel the magic.

124
00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:59.785
You guys all have
one thing in common.

125
00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:01.320
You're so damn funny to watch.

126
00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:03.688
Though I gotta say.

127
00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.357
turn 'em upside down.
they all look the same.

128
00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:06.892
It's such a guy thing.

129
00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:14.867
- I teach yoga.

130
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.004
Breath of life.

131
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:23.842
- Women don't look
at men that way.

132
00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:25.577
We could if we wanted to.

133
00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:28.815
Hey. Brit. I need you to
spell me at nine. Okay?

134
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:32.285
- Hot date?

135
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.620
- None of your damn business.

136
00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:39.758
- You must have a beautiful
name or I will surely die.

137
00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.359
- Florida.

138
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.361
- Florida!

139
00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.630
But why not Nebraska
or Carolina?

140
00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:46.466
Or Marina Del Rey

141
00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:48.233
I call you Marina!

142
00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.401
- Sure. Why Not.

143
00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:51.269
- Marina. this is more
sexy name for you.

144
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.773
The water. the boats slipping
in and out of the docks.

145
00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:56.842
this is so much more sexy.

146
00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.977
Please. you will have some wine?

147
00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.545
- Just a diet coke. no ice.

148
00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:03.548
- No. you must taste this
wine. 1987 Chateau Margaux.

149
00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:04.650
- Diet coke. no ice. Thanks.

150
00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:08.753
So. what's your name?

151
00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.690
- Marcello. Mastroianni.

152
00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:13.459
- You don't happen to
have any mouthwash?

153
00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:16.161
Never mind.

154
00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.063
Never mind.

155
00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:22.467
Look. I know you've probably
heard this before. I'm married.

156
00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:23.935
I'm married.

157
00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:24.770
But.

158
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.979
I'm just not a very good liar.

159
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.280
She always knows when
I've snuck a Snickers

160
00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:37.082
out of the fridge.
or when I smoke.

161
00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.650
Boy oh boy. she
hate when I smoke.

162
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.553
So she'd smell me. And you.

163
00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:43.021
Course. she's been
really busy lately.

164
00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.257
And I'm still young.

165
00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:50.428
You know in Europe. men
have wives and mistresses.

166
00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:51.663
(Sitar Music

167
00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:52.098
- I can do this for
one hour. 10 minutes.

168
00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.166
The Yogi Kutamanda.

169
00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:57.537
could remain in this
position for 48 hours.

170
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:03.308
One woman died of
pleasure afterward.

171
00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:04.543
Died!

172
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:08.047
So many orgasms. oh.
she could not breathe.

173
00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.650
- I mean. in Europe.
they sit around a café.

174
00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.119
You can't exactly do that here.

175
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.755
I mean there's Seattle's
Best and Starbucks.

176
00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:21.761
I kinda like. you know. prefer
the chai latte at Starbucks.

177
00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:26.365
Sprinkles. and the
nutmeg they put on it.

178
00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:29.134
Did you know that
seven-year itch

179
00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.002
is a biologically-based
phenomenon?

180
00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:32.938
That deer and bears
and. you know. animals.

181
00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.273
they take seven years to
have and wean their young.

182
00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:36.741
And then they move on and
start a whole other family!

183
00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:38.511
They're like serial monogamists!

184
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.114
So maybe I'm just in the
seven-year-itch part. huh!

185
00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:43.983
- Do it to me!

186
00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:53.124
- Oh. yeah. baby. do it to me.

187
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.794
Do it to me.

188
00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:56.194
Oh yeah baby!

189
00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:59.999
- Wait! Boston Bruins!
Boston Bruins! Boston Bruins!

190
00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:09.809
- I've only been
married. four years.

191
00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:15.880
But we dated for
four. no. five years.

192
00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:18.117
So I'm either too
early or too late.

193
00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:20.886
If you count dating.

194
00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:23.321
My therapist tells
me I need to have

195
00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:25.290
a fuller experience
of my masculinity.

196
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.758
I guess he's just
trying to say that

197
00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.994
as men. we all make mistakes
and I should. you know.

198
00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:29.862
take my turn.

199
00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:33.932
- So what can I do for you?

200
00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:35.500
- What are my choices?

201
00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:36.968
- You know the choices.

202
00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:40.538
- Ah. tell them to me.
Is so much more sexy.

203
00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:44.576
Ah. you women. on your knees
you have all the power.

204
00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:47.712
Should you ever stand.
we men are finished.

205
00:10:47.713 --> 00:10:51.049
- What you're paying. I can
go around the world with you.

206
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.486
- Can you go around
the world in 450 days?

207
00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.989
- I can go anywhere
you want. baby. 750.

208
00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:00.892
- But if I already
know it's a mistake.

209
00:11:00.893 --> 00:11:03.795
then it's not really
a mistake. is it?

210
00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:05.997
Although there could be
ramifications I am not aware of.

211
00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:07.132
Which makes it a mistake.

212
00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:09.401
So. this is a mistake.
coming to you.

213
00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:10.635
Not that you're a mistake.

214
00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.304
Just. you know.
coming to see you.

215
00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:18.644
- Boston Bruins! Boston
Bruins! Boston Bruins!

216
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.484
Whenever my Pranayama
breath begins to fail.

217
00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:28.988
I think of hockey. the
Boston Bruins specifically.

218
00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:31.824
- You know. maybe we should
get to know each other first.

219
00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:34.392
We could get some coffee.

220
00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:35.593
Maybe even take in
a play at night.

221
00:11:35.594 --> 00:11:37.696
At night. I forgot.
your prime time.

222
00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.965
So. maybe. you know. there's
this Italian film festival.

223
00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:41.934
Rosalini and De Sica.

224
00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:42.868
- Boston Bruins! Boston Bruins!

225
00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:45.370
Boston Bruins! Boston Bruins!

226
00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.206
No. coffee.
coffee sounds better.

227
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.241
Yeah. so we'll get some coffee

228
00:11:49.242 --> 00:11:50.476
and then we'll. whoa!

229
00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:55.547
- Whooo!

230
00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.881
I'm taking these drugs.

231
00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.783
that make me feel like shit.

232
00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:00.819
Clomid. Myradol.

233
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.421
And on the back here. it
says. "Symptoms may include

234
00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:07.058
severe headaches. mood
swings. nausea. hot flashes."

235
00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:09.461
I guess it makes being
pregnant downright pleasurable

236
00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.396
in comparison.

237
00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:15.333
- How much money do you make
in one year? 200.000? More?

238
00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:16.367
- Yeah. Good luck.

239
00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:17.602
- You make less?

240
00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:18.837
- Maybe.

241
00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:22.006
- What if I could pay
you one million dollars?

242
00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:23.575
- What. I gotta kill somebody?

243
00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:27.412
- Oh my darling. so
much not killing.

244
00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.582
- Yeah. This is getting
weird. I'm gotta go.

245
00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.785
- Ah! A tough negotiator!
You must be a Capricorn!

246
00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:34.620
- No.

247
00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:38.457
So. are we on the
same boat or not?

248
00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:42.494
Si. Madonna. you American
women. nothing fools you. yes?

249
00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.329
- Yes.

250
00:12:45.564 --> 00:12:46.798
Taurus.

251
00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:47.666
- Ah. I knew it!

252
00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:49.134
The bull.

253
00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:51.504
Stubborn. But so sexy.

254
00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:56.708
Aowwww!

255
00:12:56.709 --> 00:13:00.145
You are fiery. I
love this in a woman.

256
00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:02.380
I will pay you 2000.

257
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:03.615
- I only want 750.

258
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.216
- No. That is for
the other thing.

259
00:13:05.217 --> 00:13:06.584
I pay you to argue with me.

260
00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:08.086
- 750.

261
00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:09.988
- No! You must take the 2000.

262
00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:11.457
- Yeah. okay you are whacked.

263
00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.994
- This is perfetto!

264
00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:17.195
- Oh!

265
00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:19.564
Is this like the Kama
Sutra Indian shit?

266
00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:23.068
- India? No way. sister.
I am from Pakistan.

267
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.305
- Oh. you guys from Pakistan
really know what you're doing.

268
00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:29.908
Oh yeah. don't stop.
Don't stop! Don't stop!

269
00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:33.244
- Boston Bruins. Boston Bruins.

270
00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:34.079
- I'm out of here.

271
00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:34.914
- Wait!

272
00:13:36.715 --> 00:13:38.283
Where are you going?

273
00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:39.218
Wait!

274
00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:42.620
What did I do? What did I say?

275
00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:43.855
You Western women.

276
00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:46.658
you fuck like you are
shopping for vegetables!

277
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.493
- Oh. God.

278
00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:50.396
I look like shit.

279
00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:55.066
You know. we check
you guys out too.

280
00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:58.536
Your butts. your
hands. your faces.

281
00:13:58.537 --> 00:13:59.871
we're scoping out
the whole package.

282
00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:02.240
Something from the
prehistoric days.

283
00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:04.175
Searching through
the whole gene pool.

284
00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.845
trying to keep
the race evolving.

285
00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:08.580
We may start out
looking for a good fuck.

286
00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:11.784
but sooner or later we end
up looking for a good father.

287
00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.153
Maybe that's why we end up
with versions of our own dad.

288
00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:17.389
I don't know.

289
00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:20.726
Hello. is Richard there?

290
00:14:22.094 --> 00:14:24.129
Oh. Who are you. his wife?

291
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:27.666
His mother?

292
00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:31.769
What do you mean he's out of
town. he can't be out of town.

293
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.740
we had a very. very important
appointment tonight.

294
00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:38.676
Well people don't
just go out of town.

295
00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:40.412
they go someplace I mean.

296
00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:43.382
Cleveland?

297
00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.151
Nobody goes to Cleveland.

298
00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:51.657
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:21.086
- So. I am blindfolded by
Magic Girl. okay thank you.

300
00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:25.657
Okay! Can I just have the
cards. back. Thank you.

301
00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:29.395
And I need somebody
to. pick a card.

302
00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:32.964
And if you're raising
your hand. I can't see it.

303
00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:35.199
I just assume you're
right there. go ahead.

304
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.302
tell me when to stop.

305
00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:39.170
Before I'm done.

306
00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:41.372
Okay. here we go.
Tell me when to stop.

307
00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:42.308
- Stop.
- Okay. good.

308
00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:43.876
Take the top card. please.

309
00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:49.681
Do not show it to
me or Magic Girl.

310
00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:01.060
- Give me back my card.

311
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.372
- We also do a thriving
out-call business.

312
00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.608
My employees don't offer much
in the way of conversation.

313
00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:19.944
They let the clients
do the talking.

314
00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:23.881
- Society invented love to try
to keep the family together.

315
00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:25.083
Yeah. they want you to think

316
00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:26.250
there's got to be some
kind of connection

317
00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:27.986
between sex and the love thing.

318
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.254
But it just ain't true.

319
00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:33.358
No. I give you an example.
I mean I love to play golf.

320
00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:35.226
But I don't wanna have
sex with my golf partner.

321
00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:38.529
you know what I'm sayin'?

322
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.031
Man I'd love to
have sex with you.

323
00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:42.700
but I don't know if I'd
wanna play golf with you.

324
00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:46.070
Yeah. I got this Iowa deal
I've been working on for about.

325
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:50.108
oh maybe like five months.
something like that. you know.

326
00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:52.577
If I could get that
baby to close. whoo boy!

327
00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:54.212
We're talking champagne.
champagne for everybody.

328
00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:55.381
Yeah. big old payday!

329
00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:58.983
How much you usually
cost. anyway?

330
00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:00.318
I mean. it don't
make any difference.

331
00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:01.552
I mean he's gon' pay you.

332
00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:03.021
and he's gonna pay
you well. you know?

333
00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.756
I mean. I consult with
this guy. you know?

334
00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:07.291
I am his consultant. you know?

335
00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:09.428
Yeah. he you gon' like you.

336
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:13.164
We got ourselves a
little extra time here.

337
00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:14.365
Great big old limousine.

338
00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:17.301
Maybe you feel like
making yourself

339
00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:20.004
a little extra cash
here. you know?

340
00:17:20.005 --> 00:17:22.073
I ain't got a whole lot. I
didn't bring much with me.

341
00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:24.943
But. hell. he's gonna pay
you enough anyway as it is.

342
00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:27.846
The guy's got more
money than God.

343
00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:32.050
It ain't like he's gonna catch
my hand in the cookie jar.

344
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.851
before his.

345
00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:35.287
He's got everything.

346
00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:40.892
How's about a look
at your breasts? Huh?

347
00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:43.828
Yeah? I bet you could do one
of them wet-tee-shirt contests.

348
00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:46.431
Whoo-hoo. yeah. I bet you could.

349
00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:49.567
I went to one of them once
down in Cabo. whoo hoo!

350
00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:53.738
I'm tellin' you wild. I
mean real wild! Yes indeed!

351
00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.207
Them "Girls Gone Wild"
totally video things.

352
00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:57.875
you know what I'm sayin'?

353
00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:59.077
I bet it's probably kinda tame

354
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:00.945
for what you're
used to though. hey.

355
00:18:00.946 --> 00:18:02.447
Yeah!

356
00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:03.915
I mean. an example of that
is. you're kinda short.

357
00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:07.118
what are you. about 5'2".
something like that?

358
00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:07.953
Is that right?

359
00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:11.523
Yeah?

360
00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:16.327
I got an eye for height.
even with you sitting down.

361
00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:17.829
I can check it.

362
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.098
Yeah check it out get it all
the time right there yeah.

363
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:23.000
I bet you'd be one hell
of a little spinner-fuck.

364
00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.203
I bet you would.

365
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.872
I bet I could spin you around.

366
00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:30.576
I bet I could spin you around
and make your head dizzy.

367
00:18:33.546 --> 00:18:34.812
- How come?

368
00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:35.647
How come?

369
00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:40.785
There's the leather furniture
and the pretty white girls

370
00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.320
who ain't got no problems.

371
00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:43.889
I cain't pay for none of that.

372
00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:47.693
How come I can't fuck
the pretty white girls.

373
00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:51.596
I gotta fuck some nasty
whore with syphilis

374
00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:54.066
and gonorrhea and aids and shit.

375
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.969
'Cause George Bush he done it.

376
00:18:58.437 --> 00:19:02.473
He put us over there
in Nam. I was there.

377
00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:04.709
I saw everything.
They fucked up.

378
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.044
The brothers is all fucked up.

379
00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:11.116
A whole generation of Black
brothers messed up in the head.

380
00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:14.252
You ain't seen no
George Bush in Nam.

381
00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:15.586
Huh?

382
00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:16.754
Now where the fuck was he?

383
00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:19.123
Hangin' out on daddy's farm.

384
00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:24.129
that's where. MPs patrollin'
the oil fields.

385
00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:30.868
George Bush... and
that Watergate thing.

386
00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:33.271
Now. he the president

00:19:36.975 --> 00:19:38.043
That shit is...

389
00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:41.713
How much you gon' cost? Huh?

390
00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:46.684
You are skanky. girl. you are
one skanky mo' fuckin' bitch.

391
00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:47.519
Oh.

392
00:19:50.155 --> 00:19:51.957
I can't say bitch now. can I?

393
00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:58.996
I just wanna know. 'cause I
go up and down these streets.

394
00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.464
'cause I'm cold. see?

395
00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:02.867
And there's all
these pretty people.

396
00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:06.137
and I'm thinkin'. what happened?

397
00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:08.874
What happened to Love and Peace?

398
00:20:09.775 --> 00:20:12.610
Where'd those hippies go off to?

399
00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:15.780
They all just keel over and die?

400
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.282
Naw! They around.

401
00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:21.819
They just cut their hair.
put on their good suits.

402
00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.390
stash their jeans and beads
and sewed up their pockets.

403
00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:28.492
They voted for George Bush.

404
00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:30.228
I mean. where'd
those hippies go?

405
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:33.264
Not to the Nam.
that's for damn sure.

406
00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:36.300
Only black men and
spics and shit.

407
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:40.539
One or two crackers in there
too. but mostly it was us.

408
00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:44.275
And now they back.

409
00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:47.445
Them white folk.
they got their BWM's

410
00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:49.381
and their leather furniture

411
00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:54.820
and Yankee baseball
hats and warm coats.

412
00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:57.923
The love generation!

413
00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:00.425
They love they selves.

414
00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:06.664
- Number one. have
you ever paid for sex?

415
00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:09.600
Number two. was it good? Very
good? Dreamlike? Horrendous?

416
00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:11.068
Crash and burn?

417
00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:12.536
Number three. have you ever
worked in a whorehouse?

418
00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:14.171
Number four. have you ever
taken part in group sex?

419
00:21:14.172 --> 00:21:16.374
Number five. have you ever
performed magic tricks in public?

420
00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.576
Number six. have you ever
performed in a dog-and-pony act?

421
00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.678
Number seven. what does
this remind you of?

422
00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:23.080
Number eight. are you having
sexual fantasies right now?

423
00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:24.582
Number nine.

424
00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:25.683
who is the object of your
sexual fantasies right now?

425
00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:27.184
- Wait. wait. wait.

426
00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.120
Look at
the following photographs.

427
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.054
would you pay to have sex with-

428
00:21:29.055 --> 00:21:30.288
- Can I have a moment here?

429
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.455
- Sure. You need
a glass of water?

430
00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:32.757
- Okay.

431
00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:41.733
- Come on in.

432
00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:45.469
Get me a drink. would you?

433
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.004
Vodka martini if you
know how to make it.

434
00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:47.873
I'll be right back.

435
00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:49.941
- Hi. I'm Sal.

436
00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:54.211
- Where are we?

437
00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:57.114
- It's your hotel room.

438
00:21:57.115 --> 00:22:01.052
- No. I mean. what's the plan.

439
00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:02.420
How does all this work?

440
00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:04.922
- It's $300 for the hour.

441
00:22:04.923 --> 00:22:07.291
- Good lord. it's
more than my facial.

442
00:22:07.292 --> 00:22:08.126
- Yeah.

443
00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:11.463
But this'll get those
blood vessels circulating.

444
00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:14.333
It's $300.

445
00:22:15.634 --> 00:22:17.002
- I know but God.

446
00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:26.678
Where are you going?

447
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.182
- I don't negotiate on price.

448
00:22:31.383 --> 00:22:32.818
- Not even if I...

449
00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:38.523
- That's $400.

450
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:43.527
- Oh. Well. let's just
stick to the basics.

451
00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:44.396
Good.

452
00:22:44.396 --> 00:22:45.197
- You take a check?

453
00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:47.032
- Would you?

454
00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:50.135
- I guess not.

455
00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:52.003
Turn around.

456
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.308
- All right.

457
00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:02.314
- I mean. turn
and face the wall.

458
00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:05.050
- Okay.

459
00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:26.538
Okay. Here.

460
00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:10.648
- Thanks.

461
00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:12.317
- Shall we continue?

462
00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:14.920
- Okay.

463
00:24:15.887 --> 00:24:17.055
Is it hot in here?

464
00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:20.225
- I'm feeling a
little warm myself.

465
00:24:35.073 --> 00:24:36.675
When was your first ejaculation?

466
00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:43.414
- Somehow I expected a
little romance in the deal.

467
00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:45.950
- Romance'll cost you $500.

468
00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:47.251
- The market rate?

469
00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:50.754
- Let me tell you.
you're lucky at 500.

470
00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:51.590
Really?

471
00:24:51.591 --> 00:24:52.656
- Yes.

472
00:24:52.657 --> 00:24:55.192
Senior prom. I took this girl.

473
00:24:55.193 --> 00:24:58.329
set me back $750 by
the time we were done.

474
00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.964
And that was high school.

475
00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:00.832
- Did you score?

476
00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:06.738
- Yeah. I scored. I always
score when I want to.

477
00:25:07.606 --> 00:25:09.173
- Well then.

478
00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:11.942
It looks as though you chose
your profession with care.

479
00:25:11.943 --> 00:25:13.978
- Follow your bliss.

480
00:25:13.979 --> 00:25:16.280
Of course. if I
coulda done anything.

481
00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:17.849
I'd've been a real estate agent.

482
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.485
- That's not so hard.
You could do that now.

483
00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:22.953
- What? Between tricks.

484
00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:26.090
- Sure. Kind of a
work-study program.

485
00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:28.259
You could build your
clientele that way.

486
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.760
- I can't add.

487
00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:30.961
- What?

488
00:25:30.962 --> 00:25:32.730
- I can't add to save my life.

489
00:25:32.731 --> 00:25:35.799
But I was really good
at geography. though.

490
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.402
- Going around the
world your specialty?

491
00:25:38.403 --> 00:25:39.237
- No. really.

492
00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:44.109
Magellan... he's my hero.

493
00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:47.778
It took balls to do what he did.

494
00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:50.281
- Yeah. what was that?

495
00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:53.417
- Everyone remembers
Columbus. right?

496
00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:56.620
Magellan. boom! Way more cool.

497
00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.356
Magellan circumnavigated
the globe.

498
00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:00.891
- Circumnavigated?

499
00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:04.862
- Yeah. went around the
world. in a boat in 1522.

500
00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:07.998
Now. considering everyone else
thought the world was flat.

501
00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:11.869
Magellan. this guy. He's like
Kobe or Shaq or something.

502
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.103
I mean. think about it.

503
00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:15.739
no refrigerators. no
telephones. no GPS.

504
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.141
no radar. no electri-

505
00:26:17.142 --> 00:26:20.712
- We're not here for a
geography lesson. are we? Sal.

506
00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:24.883
- I think there's some
exploring I can do.

507
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.764
- Ever had sex with a
partner of the same sex?

508
00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:43.067
Ever had a partner of no sex?

509
00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:44.002
- Wait. what does that mean?

510
00:26:44.003 --> 00:26:45.436
- Have you ever had no sex?

511
00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:48.472
- Do you mean. have
I ever been celibate?

512
00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:49.975
- How often do you masturbate?

513
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:56.113
- Can I just write these down?

514
00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:58.182
- The purpose of this study
is to monitor the physical

515
00:26:58.183 --> 00:26:59.917
and physiological
responses to verbal

516
00:26:59.918 --> 00:27:01.619
as well as visual stimuli.

517
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.056
- But I'm embarrassed.

518
00:27:05.924 --> 00:27:07.024
- I think that's evident.

519
00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:09.827
- Can't we just skip this part?

520
00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:10.662
- Fine.

521
00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:17.501
- Do I still get paid the $200?

522
00:27:17.502 --> 00:27:19.536
- You haven't completed
the questionnaire.

523
00:27:19.537 --> 00:27:20.738
- But I-
- You must complete the

524
00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:22.540
questionnaire or the
data will be incomplete.

525
00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:25.877
- How many more questions?

526
00:27:27.846 --> 00:27:28.647
- Just five.

527
00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:32.549
- Can't you just
write them down?

528
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.551
- No. But I can whisper
them if you'd like.

529
00:27:34.552 --> 00:27:37.955
- But no one's in the room.

530
00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:39.324
- You know. watching.

531
00:27:40.458 --> 00:27:42.126
- People been watching us?

532
00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:43.727
- Of course. It is
a study. after all.

533
00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:45.262
NSF isn't going to fund research

534
00:27:45.263 --> 00:27:47.331
on the effects of socio-sexual
behavioral patterns

535
00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:48.532
without empirical data.

536
00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:50.167
- You mean. scientists
are watching us?

537
00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:52.770
- Oh yeah. and video.
Electroencephalograms.

538
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:54.939
That's why the wires and all.

539
00:27:58.543 --> 00:28:00.644
- Maybe you'd better whisper.

540
00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:01.446
- Okay.

541
00:28:05.817 --> 00:28:07.819
- Let's just not talk. okay?

542
00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:11.122
- Who's talking?

543
00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:14.459
- Oh. okay.

544
00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:18.129
- Besides it wasn't
me yammering anyway.

545
00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:19.831
- What was that?

546
00:28:19.832 --> 00:28:20.931
- Nothing.

547
00:28:20.932 --> 00:28:22.633
- Did you just say. yammering?

548
00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:24.369
That I'm yammering? Me?

549
00:28:25.503 --> 00:28:27.805
- I just want to make
you happy. honey.

550
00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:30.775
- Don't you honey me.
Sal. You yammerer.

551
00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:34.578
Oh here we go.

552
00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:35.647
- Here we go. what?

553
00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:39.249
- Hey. Let's just drop it. okay?

554
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.719
- Oh. yeah you
wanna just drop it?

555
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.854
Next thing you know you'll
be trying to take it back.

556
00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:45.355
- I do. I take it back.

557
00:28:45.356 --> 00:28:47.357
- Well you can't just take
it back! It's been said!

558
00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:48.559
- All right. you know what?

559
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.094
I don't have to
listen to this crap.

560
00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:52.663
- Oh. excuse me but
who exactly is paying

561
00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:53.831
for this little date?

562
00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:56.100
This big romantic fuck?

563
00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:57.936
- Looks like me in
that special way.

564
00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:05.410
- Get outta here.

565
00:29:07.278 --> 00:29:11.750
Get your clothes and get out.

566
00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:15.953
- There's a little settling up
that we gotta do first. lady.

567
00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:17.354
- We've have nothing to settle.

568
00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:19.823
- It's $350 for the date.

569
00:29:19.824 --> 00:29:21.592
- This is no date.
This is not a date.

570
00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:23.093
- Yes it is.

571
00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:24.928
- And you said 300 before.
when did it become 350?

572
00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:29.867
- It's 300 for the fuck.
an extra 50 because you...

573
00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:31.236
touched my clothes!

574
00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:38.977
- I don't owe you one red cent.

575
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:47.352
- Usually we just
start breaking things

576
00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:53.157
until you decide to cooperate.

577
00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:55.626
- You break one thing and
I'll see you in court.

578
00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:57.261
- You're gonna sue me?

579
00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:59.396
Why don't you just
give me the extra $50

580
00:29:59.397 --> 00:30:00.998
and I'll get out of your hair.

581
00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:02.533
- No.

582
00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:03.368
- Gimme the money!

583
00:30:03.368 --> 00:30:04.202
- Put that down.

584
00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:05.036
- The money!

585
00:30:05.036 --> 00:30:05.970
- I know karate.

586
00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:07.471
- Gimme the fuckin' money!

587
00:30:09.007 --> 00:30:10.374
- You almost broke this vase!

588
00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:11.309
- Oh. fuck!

589
00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:15.412
Oh. you broke my fucking balls!

590
00:30:15.413 --> 00:30:16.247
- Okay!

591
00:30:16.248 --> 00:30:17.248
Okay. just quiet down.

- Oh. you really do know karate!

593
00:30:19.684 --> 00:30:21.185
Here. Just put this on it.

594
00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:23.854
- Ah Jesus Christ! Is that ice?

595
00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:25.956
- That's what you use to
keep the swelling down.

596
00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:30.027
- Oh.

597
00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:33.597
Oh God.

598
00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:35.032
Oh.

599
00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:40.004
- Oh my God.

600
00:30:40.638 --> 00:30:45.176
Oh my God.

601
00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:49.479
Oh my God.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.248
Oh my God.

00:30:52.817 --> 00:30:53.685
Oh my God.

604
00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:23.348
Maybe I could call
you some time?

605
00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.415
- What?

606
00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:28.052
- I'd like to ask
you out. a date.

607
00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:30.654
- Dinner? A movie?

608

Oh.

612
00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:40.264
Does your husband know
what you do for a living?

613
00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.734
- My husband's the lead
scientist on this project.

614
00:31:44.769 --> 00:31:45.536
- So.

- He's been watching the
entire interview. right there.

617
00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:57.482
He's a scientist.

- I'll say.

622
00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:44.094
- You are one looney
chick. you know that?

623
00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:46.463
- I don't think anyone's
ever called me that before.

624
00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:48.131
- What. looney?

625
00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:50.034
All they gotta do
is look at you lady.

626
00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:54.605
- It's just. I'm the
CEO of my company.

627
00:32:56.774 --> 00:33:00.177
And nobody would dare
call me a looney chick.

628
00:33:00.178 --> 00:33:03.613
- Hey. I gotta go
to the hospital.

629
00:33:06.818 --> 00:33:08.251
My balls are gonna fall off.

630
00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:09.087

- I'll drive you.

633
00:33:11.422 --> 00:33:13.457
I hurt you. the least I can
do is get you to the hospital.

634
00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:21.699
- This has been some date. huh.

635
00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:28.973
- Maybe we can reschedule.

636
00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:32.709
- You wanna what?

637
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.811
- You know. maybe when
you're feeling better.

638
00:33:34.812 --> 00:33:36.948
- Like some time next November?

639
00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:41.218

640
00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:42.487
We'd. you know.

641
00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:46.157
We called ourselves
fuck buddies.

642
00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:49.026
- You mean that he knew you

643
00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:51.062
and he still wanted
to have sex with you?

644
00:33:51.996 --> 00:33:54.031
- I come to town pretty often.

645
00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:55.233
We could be fuck buddies.

646
00:33:58.236 --> 00:34:02.339
- Excuse me. this. is
how I make my living.

647
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.474
- Oh. I'll pay you.

648
00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:05.443
Money is no object.

- What?

650
00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:14.418
That's not what you said
just a few minutes ago.

651
00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:15.286
- Oh. I know.

652
00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:17.288
I was just.

653
00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:24.295
I'm sorry.

- What?

656
00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:36.307
- I'll bet you don't
apologize much.

657
00:34:38.776 --> 00:34:39.610
- No.

658
00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:46.884
- Thank you. The ice helped.

659
00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:55.092
- It's cold. And wet.

660
00:34:58.196 --> 00:34:59.997
- I wanna start
over with the date.

661
00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:14.212

romance would cost extra.

662
00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:16.481
- Next time.

Around the world?

Ah. that's a little
pricey for me.

680
00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:21.711
I'll just take the blow job.

681

685
00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:34.858
like a fucking vacuum cleaner.

We'd go to the movies.

Oh. yeah. that's good.

Karen lifts her head. and
there's jizz all over her lip.

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:14.431
And the waitress. she don't
miss a beat. she smiles

698
00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:17.468
and says. "You want some
extra napkins with that?"

699
00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:20.370
Oh man.

700
00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:22.505

Great in bed.

But he was a poet. you know?

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:28.979
- Oh. God save me from
poets. And guitar players.

704
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.947
- Yeah. He was moody.

705
00:37:30.948 --> 00:37:33.416
I never knew what mood
he was gonna end up in.

706
00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:37.053
Oh God. he jumped out of a
window. tried to kill himself.

707
00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:40.023
ended up in a fucking
wheelchair. I forgot.

708
00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:41.224
Loser.

709
00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:44.395
- Oh man. we had
fun in the old days.

710
00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:49.033
- Grace. you're gonna get
old just looking for lines.

711
00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:51.168
Stop.

712
00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:57.540
- It probably starts just
as Uranus and Jupiter

713
00:37:57.541 --> 00:38:01.544
go into Aries. Saturn
passes into Libra.

714
00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:04.681
and the sun and
moon cross Cancer.

715
00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:08.452
- I bought her flowers.
real nice flowers.

716
00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:11.454
you think that makes
any difference?

717
00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:13.123
- If we're lucky enough
to still be standing here

718
00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:18.129
after all this massive
shit-storm currently raining down

719
00:38:19.563 --> 00:38:22.699
on the human population.
well then I say. sit back.

720
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.669
relax and enjoy the movie.

721
00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:28.072
- Have you ever been in love?

722
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.176
They was right about it.

723
00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:35.578
It hurts to be in love.

724
00:38:35.579 --> 00:38:38.249
It hurts so much.
- You want some more?

725
00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:41.519
- I'll kill 'em both.

726
00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:46.523
I'll find out where they are.
which goddamn motel they're in

727
00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:49.359
and put a bullet in their heads!

728
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.428
- I'll suck cock and
take it up the ass

729
00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:52.830
for the right dollar figure.

730
00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:55.266
'Cause none of this matters.

731
00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:02.306
- Hey. hey. come on.
come on. come on.

732
00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:08.678
Let's try again. all right?

733
00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:11.382
- Not when you look at the
night sky with a telescope.

734
00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:14.984
- Here's more.

735
00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:16.120
Is all I got.

736
00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:19.289
- See. I got this telescope.

737
00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:22.258
And last night. I looked
up and I saw a galaxy

738
00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:24.362
50 million light years away.

739
00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:27.664
I'm looking at light
particles that left their home

740
00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:30.567
50 million years ago!

741
00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:33.503
So don't try to tell
me any of this matters.

742
00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:36.974
Except maybe a good
laugh. And a good fuck.

743
00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:54.825
♪ <i>Watching and waiting for
this movie in the dark</i> ♪

744
00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:58.762
- Hey. hey. turn
around. Turn around.

745
00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:03.768
♪ <i>Time slowly. fading while
the actors play their part</i> ♪

746
00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:21.752
♪ <i>Time slowly. fading while
the actors play their part</i> ♪

747
00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:33.864
- Oh no. this is not good.

748
00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:36.133
I've got to go teach a class.

749
00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:38.436
Oh.

750
00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:44.909
Oh. that is not good.

751
00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:48.845
- All right what number's this?

752
00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:50.413
- Six!
- No. it's seven!

753
00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:51.981
- No. six!
- It's seven!

754
00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:53.383
I need to borrow a ring from
someone in the audience.

755
00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:55.719
Any kind of a ring?
Wedding ring? Anything?

756
00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:57.888
Okay. if you don't
give me a ring.

757
00:40:57.889 --> 00:40:59.289
we can't go to intermission.

758
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.458
Well. last trick
before intermission!

759
00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:02.393
Come on now. Great.

760
00:41:02.394 --> 00:41:03.593
Okay! Beautiful! Here's a ring!

761
00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:05.295
Now watch very carefully
as I take the ring.

762
00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:06.930
put it on my finger.
throw it in the air.

763
00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:09.365
like so. it disappears.
reach in my back pocket.

764
00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:12.902
and there. on my
zipped-up key ring case.

765
00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:16.573
is a bunch of keys. and a
ring. is this your ring. Ma'am?

766
00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:17.408
Yeah!

767
00:41:17.409 --> 00:41:18.843
- Okay good. you happy?

768
00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:23.313
It's intermission!

769
00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:24.681
Get some milk and cookies okay?

770
00:41:24.682 --> 00:41:26.617
Get something to drink.

771
00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:38.695
Vodka.

772
00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:40.598
- I thought you weren't
drinking during shows.

773
00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:45.068
- What? I have to. like.
pass a test to get a drink?

774
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.836
- Get out!

775
00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:48.905
- What. I just want a drink.

776
00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:52.108
- Go back to the casino.
They've got six bars there.

777
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.910
- Grace. c'mon.

778
00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:54.845
- Go away.

779
00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:57.414
- I just want one fucking vodka.

780
00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:01.852
- Behave?

781
00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.021
- Yeah.

782
00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:11.060
- What are you in
such a good mood for?

783
00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:13.129
- Why are you such a shit?

784
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.564
- I hate my job.

785
00:42:14.565 --> 00:42:15.599
What's your excuse?

786
00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:20.938
- I got dumped by some asshole
for a trip to Cleveland.

787
00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:24.807
- A big date?

788
00:42:24.808 --> 00:42:25.976
- None of you business.

789
00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:28.511
Why don't you just quit?

790
00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:30.947
- Why don't you
get another date?

791
00:42:30.948 --> 00:42:31.782
- Point taken.

792
00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:36.921
Is it the gig. or the city?

793
00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:45.029
- I just wanna move on with
my fucking life somehow.

794
00:42:45.663 --> 00:42:46.030
and I just.

795
00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:48.665
I don't know how.

796
00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:49.633
- Can't go forward.

797
00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:52.102
- Can't go back.

798
00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:57.908
I know.

799
00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:02.646
I had this date
tonight with Richard.

800
00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:07.384
I figured he's alone. I'm
alone. we'd get together.

801
00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:12.355
I even took these
drugs. fertility drugs.

802
00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:13.757
they made me feel like shit.

803
00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:18.695
- What? You want to have
a baby with this guy?

804
00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:19.997
- That's the general idea.

805
00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:25.069
- Wow! Congratulations.

806
00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:29.173
- No. no. it didn't work out.

807
00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:33.110
I had this list. you know?

808
00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:37.348
Brains. looks. the
whole genetic alphabet.

809
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:39.550
Richard was the guy.

810
00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:42.052
It was supposed to be tonight.

811
00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:45.555
- Oh.

812
00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:46.723
What he just left?

813
00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:48.257
- Yeah.

814
00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:50.026
To Cleveland.

815
00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:52.429
What's in Cleveland.
huh? Nothing.

816
00:43:56.033 --> 00:43:57.234
You ever think about kids?

817
00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:01.070
- Think about them? I
work with them every day.

818
00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:03.741
- No. I mean about having. kids.

819
00:44:08.545 --> 00:44:12.282
- No. They're too
self-centered and spoiled.

820
00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:16.452
And there's only room for
one of those in my life.

821
00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:18.555
- You could learn. to
be less self-centered.

822
00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.125
- Sorry.

823
00:44:23.927 --> 00:44:26.497
I guess I've just done too
many shows or something.

824
00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:29.932
Besides. I don't
wanna bring a kid

825
00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:31.602
into a world this fucked up.

826
00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:33.470
- I know.

827
00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:39.375
Seemed to me to be the
greatest act of faith.

828
00:44:39.376 --> 00:44:44.114
You know. to try. Not
to give up.

829
00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:51.587
- Right now it's
just a full-time job

830
00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:53.323
trying to figure
out my own life.

831
00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.295
- You gon' go finish
your show now?

832
00:45:00.198 --> 00:45:01.231
- Yeah. I guess.

833
00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:07.204
Thank you for the. drink.

834
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:14.545
Hey. Grace.

835
00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:23.153
I used to love this one.

836
00:45:24.354 --> 00:45:26.356
First time I saw it. I thought.

837
00:45:28.258 --> 00:45:30.194
"That's why I got into magic."

838
00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:39.470
Well. it used to cheer me up.

839
00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:42.939
- Thank you for trying.

840
00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:45.042
- Hey.

841
00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:47.778
come back later.

842
00:45:48.645 --> 00:45:49.646
If you feel like it.

843
00:45:59.556 --> 00:46:01.125
- So. what's gonna happen?

844
00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:05.996
Well. some say the
sky will open up

845
00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:09.032
and rain fire down
upon our heads

846
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.368
the Lord will appear

847
00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:15.472
and the blessed will
be taken into Heaven

848
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.175
and the damned into hell.

849
00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.545
In the Big FJ.

850
00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:24.081
Final Judgment.

851
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.619
- Would you like a drink?

852
00:46:30.654 --> 00:46:33.957
Of vodka of course.

853
00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:37.627
I should have died years ago

854
00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:39.229
from all the vodka that I drink.

855
00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:45.368
Do you understand
a word I'm saying?

856
00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:49.205
Of course not.

857
00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:50.374
How utterly delightful.

858
00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:52.042
- Happy.

859
00:46:53.243 --> 00:46:57.113
So glad to see you. Did
you get to my last gig?

860
00:46:57.114 --> 00:46:59.216
I left a message for
you with the doorman.

861
00:47:00.717 --> 00:47:03.220
It's okay. it was a
late night anyway.

862
00:47:04.087 --> 00:47:05.756
The piano was out of tune.

863
00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:12.629
Oh no. they can't...

864
00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:17.967
I start playing tonight.
and just like that.

865
00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:19.903
just like that. I stop.

866
00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:24.508
'Cause I forgot. the lyrics.

867
00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.410
I can't play the tune

868
00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:29.779
if I don't remember the lyrics.

869
00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:30.881
So I stopped.

870
00:47:32.816 --> 00:47:36.720
My wife. that's her favorite
song. she loved that song.

871
00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:39.656
Oh no. they...

872
00:47:44.761 --> 00:47:46.796
Arigato.

873
00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:51.335
You know. we could
just talk awhile.

874
00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:56.640
- Yes.

875
00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:00.477
You look like a
bear. a dancing bear.

876
00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:05.448
You might rethink your
particular fashion statement.

877
00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:06.682
God knows I'm not judging you.

878
00:48:06.683 --> 00:48:08.417
it's just I believe the
clothes make the man.

879
00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:10.519
You could use some refinement

880
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.787
in some of your
choices here. you know.

881
00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:13.590
I know that we just met.

882
00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:17.294
Do you read. sir?

883
00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:19.930
Read. as in books?

884
00:48:21.598 --> 00:48:23.666
Yes. I do seem to have
quite a few of them.

885
00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:27.070
I bring them along as
companions on my journey.

886
00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:29.538
I've read all of
these. so of course.

887
00:48:29.539 --> 00:48:31.675
the question would
be. what next?

888
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:36.979
Reading can be something of
a savior when one's alone.

889
00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:41.985
Well. let me refresh your glass.

890
00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:46.056
You're not much a
drinker. are you friend?

891
00:48:48.525 --> 00:48:50.793
- This is some
window you got here.

892
00:48:50.794 --> 00:48:52.562
Hey. where are you
from? What city?

893
00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:56.432
Let me guess. not New York.

894
00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:57.668
You got too sweet a face.

895
00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:02.538
I just heard a bit of an accent.

896
00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:06.776
Charming though. I just thought.
maybe Chicago or something.

897
00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:07.744
- Chicago.

898
00:49:07.745 --> 00:49:09.845
- And the blond hair.

899
00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:13.082
Blond hair.

900
00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:14.918
- It look real nice on you.

901
00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:19.156
Your hair dresser
done a real nice job.

902
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.558
I like it blond better.

903
00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:25.729
My wife has dark hair.

904
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:30.366
Well. now with the
treatments she's got a wig.

905
00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:35.172
but she's real pretty. even
with most of her hair gone.

906
00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:46.416
She was always worried that I
would go to a younger woman.

907
00:49:49.252 --> 00:49:52.022
I never did. Ever.

908
00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:59.963
Look at that building there.

909
00:50:00.864 --> 00:50:02.566
That's real old brick.

910
00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:06.136
You don't see that much anymore.

911
00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:11.141
Looks kinda like a castle.

912
00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:15.779
That's a coincidence. isn't it?

913
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.948
Do you know what that is?

914
00:50:19.182 --> 00:50:21.250
That's the hospital. isn't it?

915
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:25.221
It is. I should've known.

916
00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:29.326
We're on this side of
the. I didn't realize.

917
00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:31.128
No.

918
00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:46.710
I don't wanna do anything.

919
00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:51.815
I don't even know
why I come up here.

920
00:50:55.685 --> 00:51:00.123
You can keep the
money. Here's a tip.

921
00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:21.745
She was a real
funny kid. my girl.

922
00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:27.183
She would always
laugh at my bad jokes.

923
00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:29.820
even after 20 times
me telling 'em.

924
00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:36.092
Why. just last Tuesday. just
Tuesday. just three days ago.

925
00:51:36.093 --> 00:51:38.394
I got her to laugh.

926
00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:43.400
She actually laughed
which was hard

927
00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:46.636
'cause she was hurting so bad.

928
00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:05.956
I have to go.

929
00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.495
I have to go.

930
00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:18.001
You take care.

931
00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:22.004
And be careful. 'cause
it's dangerous out there.

932
00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:23.806
And I'll bet there's
people out there.

933
00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:27.443
there's someone out
there. worrying about you.

934
00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:30.847
thinking about you.
at this very moment.

935
00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:39.523
People dying every day.

936
00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:51.101
You take care.

937
00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:54.538
- But I think God's
smarter than that.

938
00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:58.775
I think He's gonna
sneak up on us.

939
00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:01.945
One day. He'll just show up.

940
00:53:03.246 --> 00:53:05.447
He'll have some
cleaning up to do.

941
00:53:05.448 --> 00:53:08.751
The air. the water.
certain politicians.

942
00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:10.853
But there'll be a time of peace.

943
00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:14.124
Like we can take the race
out of the human race.

944
00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:17.627
Well. I gotta get
back to studying.

945
00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:21.564
Unless you've got some
more disposable income

946
00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:22.899
you wanna dispose on me.

947
00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:30.373
See. this integral calculus
needs time to sink in.

948
00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:33.542
I can handle the
one-variable stuff.

949
00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:38.548
but the two-variable stuff
is one mind-bending fuck.

950
00:53:41.985 --> 00:53:45.555
Hey. you got a handle
on integral calculus?

951
00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:56.865
- Oh yes my. you do stay
in shape. don't you?

952
00:53:56.866 --> 00:54:00.936
There must be something to this
gym-health-club craze. huh?

953
00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:02.705
I find it a bit of a circus

954
00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:04.273
with all the women
prouncing around

955
00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:07.042
with their silly little outfits.

956
00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:10.079
I don't hate women. I just
find them superficial.

957
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.780
They lack substance.

958
00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:15.351
Always wondered. what is
one to talk with them about?

959
00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:17.186
My mother was a wonderful
conversationalist

960
00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:20.189
but even she could be limited

961
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.991
in the breadth of her subjects.

962
00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:24.194
I just will never understand.

963
00:54:25.729 --> 00:54:28.063
Never will understand.

964
00:54:28.064 --> 00:54:28.865
Yes.

965
00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:34.570
Would you mind?

966
00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:35.405
Yes.

967
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.608
Do you ever get lonely. sir?

968
00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:40.976
Lonely?

969
00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:44.681
Do you ever feel. alone?

970
00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:50.253
Oh. never mind.

971
00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:56.926
Beautiful. quite.
quite beautiful.

972
00:54:58.461 --> 00:55:03.333
Yes. so bovine. so diamond hard.

973
00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:07.971
Youth always is. somehow.
so oblivious to it all.

974
00:55:09.072 --> 00:55:13.776
Here you are. like
Michelangelo's "David."

975
00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:18.782
And I do not mean the
dance club. friend. No.

976
00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:20.150
I mean an artist.

977
00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:24.287
An artist who loved
the human form.

978
00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:27.590
It seemed to keep him going.

979
00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:35.031
And you are beautiful.
Yes you are.

980
00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:38.201
And I am drunk.

981
00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:43.773
To Michelangelo.

982
00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:51.748
Come here.

983
00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:04.694
I am going to suck you dry.

984
00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:12.702
- I love this one.

985
00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:15.538
It's just so pure.

986
00:56:20.443 --> 00:56:22.211
But I guess I'm kind of
inconsistent. actually.

987
00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:24.012
'Cause you know
all these tricks.

988
00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:26.115
sooner or later
just become tricks.

989
00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:26.950
Lies.

990
00:56:28.385 --> 00:56:30.653
Show me a trick. it's
like saying. lie to me.

991
00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:33.289
Even this one.

992
00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:38.127
If I keep doing it.
sooner or later.

993
00:56:38.128 --> 00:56:39.462
I'm probably gonna hate it.

994
00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.433
But I'm gonna do
it for you anyway.

995
00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:46.970
- You're supposed
to do this one.

996
00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:50.139
- See. if I lie to you.

997
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.908
Magic Girl will tell
you that I'm sane.

998
00:56:54.377 --> 00:56:57.747
But if I tell you the truth.
she'll tell you I've gone nuts.

999
00:56:58.848 --> 00:57:00.350
- You're gonna blow this gig.

1000
00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:03.653
- Don't worry. You'll get paid.

1001
00:57:12.495 --> 00:57:13.963
The one-handed link.

1002
00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:22.439
It always worked so
well in the shower.

1003
00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:33.148
- Marina?

1004
00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:34.050
I'm sleeping.

1005
00:57:35.185 --> 00:57:36.685
- For this I pay you?

1006
00:57:36.686 --> 00:57:37.954
- No. for this.

1007
00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:41.758
- Ow!
- You pay me.

1008
00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:45.829
That was my union
break. Marcello.

1009
00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:53.902
- I thought you'd
never make the kiss.

1010
00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:55.404
- I woke up romantic.

1011
00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:57.706
- I could marry you.

1012
00:57:57.707 --> 00:58:01.243
- Make an honest woman of
me? Yeah. no thank you.

1013
00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:03.579
- Of course. you are right.

1014
00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.881
You know why I go to escort
service and not the date?

1015
00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:07.616
- 'Cause whores
know how to fuck.

1016
00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:09.718
- You are so direct. my darling.

1017
00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:12.621
But also. the women I date
want to marry me. for my money.

1018
00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:15.123
- Whereas I only wanna
fuck you for your money.

1019
00:58:15.124 --> 00:58:17.493
- Yes. my darling. You
are. how I say? Authentic.

1020
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:18.962
This I love about you.

1021
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:23.733
Come. what is your real name?

1022
00:58:24.634 --> 00:58:25.734
- I already told you.

1023
00:58:25.735 --> 00:58:26.669
- I do not believe you.

1024
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:27.903
- What's your real name?

1025
00:58:27.904 --> 00:58:28.771
- I tell you.

1026
00:58:28.772 --> 00:58:30.006
- No. you lied.

1027
00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:32.341
I saw those Fellini movies.

1028
00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:34.544
you are definitely not
Marcello Mastroianni.

1029
00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:39.015
Come on. what's your real name?

1030
00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:43.186
- Emilio Santangelo Tognoni.

1031
00:58:46.155 --> 00:58:46.990
And yours?

1032
00:58:47.924 --> 00:58:49.157
- Santa Lucia.

1033
00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:51.960
- Come on. I tell you
mine. you tell me yours.

1034
00:58:51.961 --> 00:58:54.162
- Marilynn Monroe.

1035
00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:56.965
- Okay. I pay you
1.000 to tell me.

1036
00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:58.367
- Really. $1.000?

1037
00:58:58.368 --> 00:58:59.368
- $100.

1038
00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:00.702
- You said $1.000.

1039
00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:02.738
- I make mistake. My
English not so good.

1040
00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:04.973
- I just forgot my real name.

1041
00:59:04.974 --> 00:59:08.644
- Okay. okay! I pay you $1.000.
now you tell me your name.

1042
00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:10.078
- Let's see the bucks.

1043
00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:10.914
- After. Later.

1044
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:13.448
- Now.

1045
00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:16.718
Maybe we get one more...

1046
00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:18.053
For same price?

1047
00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:18.888
- Maybe.

1048
00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:26.495
It's raining and I
can't get wet.

1049
00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:27.330
- I'm sorry?

1050
00:59:28.197 --> 00:59:29.699
- It's all this sex happening.

1051
00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:33.336
- You're looking for a date?

1052
00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:36.039
- Maybe.

1053
00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.409
- Wow. I didn't think...

1054
00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:41.611
- You didn't think what?

1055
00:59:42.812 --> 00:59:45.148
- You're the boss.
I didn't think...

1056
00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:47.917
- Shut up.

1057
00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:50.420
Come dance with me.

1058
00:59:55.491 --> 00:59:57.626
♪ <i>I'm going crazy over you</i> ♪

00:59:57.627 --> 00:59:59.028
I love this song.

1060
01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:03.933
Oh God. why didn't
I get married?

1061
01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:08.404
Not like I didn't have
enough guys asking me.

1062
01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:17.579
Hey. this is the happiest
place on earth. isn't it. Dave?

1063
01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.217
Disneyland's got nothing on us.

1064
01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:24.087
Hey. Dave?

1065
01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:28.523
You got any kids?

1066
01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:32.695
- It depends on whether
or not he's talking to me.

1067
01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:36.165
- What does he look like?

1068
01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:42.271
- Takes after his mother.
Good looking. not too bright.

1069
01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.909
- I bet that makes him
popular with the girls. huh.

1070
01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:48.745
- Oh yeah.

1071
01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:53.816
I guess that makes him the
smartest kid in his class.

1072
01:00:56.419 --> 01:01:01.324
So what room do you have free?

1073
01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.994
- Why don't we find out?

1074
01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:11.000
- Wow. Yeah.

1075
01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:17.039
What?

1076
01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.778
I'm sorry.

1077
01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:26.348
- What's so funny?

1078
01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.083
- Nothing. I...

1079
01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:36.459
- Bitch.

1080
01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:50.573
- Okay. Now. tell me your name.

1081
01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:52.875
- Kay Leonard.

1082
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:55.944
- No.

1083
01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:58.948
- Yeah. Kay Eleanor Leonard.

1084
01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:03.452
- This name. not $1.000 name.

1085
01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:05.654
- Tough shit. buddy. you
agreed and I got the cash.

1086
01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:10.125
- No. I mean merely you are too
beautiful to have this name.

1087
01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:12.195
- I know. It's a dumb name. huh?

1088
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:14.931
- You. Kay Leonard.

1089
01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:17.333
You have baby with me?

1090
01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:19.901
- What?

1091
01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:20.936
Are you nuts?

1092
01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:22.170
Get out of here!

1093
01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:23.371
- I want to have
bambino with you.

1094
01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:26.074
- Okay. do not joke
about this. I'm serious.

1095
01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:28.845
- I am serious too. Why not
you want to have baby with me?

1096
01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.481
- You not exactly breaking
down the doors of romance.

1097
01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:33.982
Just can it. okay?

1098
01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.217
Is very romantic.

1099
01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:36.218
- Oh. you want me
to have your bambino

1100
01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:38.353
but you don't wanna marry me?

1101
01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:42.691
- No. because then is
sure way to kill romance.

1102
01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:44.760
- But it's okay for me
to vomit for three months

1103
01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:47.195
and then drop some kid on his
head that looks just like you?

1104
01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:48.498
- Maybe like you too.

1105
01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.200
I pay you a lot of money.

1106
01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:55.505
- Okay.

1107
01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.907
- What?

1108
01:02:58.908 --> 01:02:59.675
- I'll do it.

1109
01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.444
- You make joke. yes?

1110
01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.447
- I make joke. no
come on. let's go.

1111
01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:08.150
- What. now? Tonight?

1112
01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:11.253
- Yeah. I'm ready. And I'm
gonna be a great mommy.

1113
01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.088
You know as soon as I
get out of this place

1114
01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:14.356
and I get a house.

1115
01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:15.557
- Okay. wait!
- We need a four-bedroom house

1116
01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:17.058
so that my family can
come live with us.

1117
01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:18.560
- First maybe we talk. First
we talk. We talk. We talk.

1118
01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:20.162
- And I want a Volvo 'cause
they're really safe for kids.

1119
01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:21.663
- Of course. Oh. ow!

1120
01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:23.932
Yeah. Okay. Oh. no. no. no. no.

1121
01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:26.735
But first maybe we practice.

1122
01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:28.503
- What's there to practice. huh?

1123
01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:30.438
You're gonna take one of
those pre-natal classes?

1124
01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:32.842
Learn how to change
diapers and shit?

1125
01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:40.583
- You are such a
jokey girl. mami.

1126
01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.621
- Yeah. I'm a jokey girl.

1127
01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.525
And you are one weird dude.

1128
01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:56.499
- And I have money.
Lots and lots of money.

1129
01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:02.404
You know it's a good thing
you know how to fuck.

1130
01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:04.740
- Life. she is. how do you say?

1131
01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.411
Molto complicato. Si?

1132
01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:12.281
Yeah. Molto complicato.

1133
01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:18.688
- Already you begin
to learn Italian.

1134
01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.230
- 10!

1135
01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.935
This is my last trick.

1136
01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:37.206
Watch carefully. When I'm done.
I'll tell you how it works.

1137
01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:40.976
- I can't believe I
turned down Lance Burton

1138
01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:41.878
to work with you.

1139
01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:50.352
- So. I've been
doing these tricks.

1140
01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:52.788
These lies. for
so many years now.

1141
01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:56.359
It started as an easy
way to meet women.

1142
01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:58.960
To get laid.

1143
01:04:58.961 --> 01:05:00.830
To control the illusion.

1144
01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:03.431
Funny thing about
the women. though.

1145
01:05:03.432 --> 01:05:06.001
They always wanted me
to explain the tricks.

1146
01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:08.036
You know. that's totally
taboo for magicians.

1147
01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:09.537
You never give
away your secrets.

1148
01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:13.476
But I figured. I was sleeping
with them. so what the hell.

1149
01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.680
I did it. I'd give
away the tricks.

1150
01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:20.815
And I gotta tell you
something. every time.

1151
01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:22.684
every single time.

1152
01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:24.719
they would get this
look on their faces.

1153
01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.557
this look of disappointment.

1154
01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:32.193
'Cause you're not just
telling them the trick.

1155
01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:34.730
You're telling them there's
no such thing as magic.

1156
01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:39.635
No perfect romance to
sweep them off their feet.

1157
01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:42.637
After that. it was
just a matter of time.

1158
01:05:42.638 --> 01:05:45.041
They would leave me.
or I would leave them.

1159
01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:47.109
Usually it was mutual.

1160
01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.812
They could never get that
look of disappointment

1161
01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:51.881
off their faces.

1162
01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:55.150
So. now I want to find a life

1163
01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:57.252
that's not filled
with disappointment.

1164
01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:58.955
I don't care where.

1165
01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:02.792
just some place. authentic.

1166
01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:06.428
'Cause when you're in that zone.

1167
01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:08.898
and you're feeling authentic.

1168
01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:12.567
well. there's nothing
disappointing about it.

1169
01:06:16.772 --> 01:06:18.574
So this is my last trick.

1170
01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:24.480
Forever.

1171
01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:31.287
Voi-fucking-la.

1172
01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.125
Hope you enjoyed the show.

1173
01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:41.696
Right. Right. I was gonna
tell you how I did the trick.

1174
01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:42.531
Well guess what?

1175
01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:45.701
I lied.

1176
01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:48.837
- I just couldn't
stay with Richard.

1177
01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.439
he's just such a shitty painter.

1178
01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:55.678
And Tom. lawyers.
what can you say?

1179
01:06:57.079 --> 01:06:58.480
- Grace!
- Can you come down here?

1180
01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:00.081
- I'm coming!

1181
01:07:00.082 --> 01:07:01.850
There's Kelly. he's
a great businessman.

1182
01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:05.254
Very rich. very smart.
very successful.

1183
01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.924
Finally I gotta say. he's
just one shitty human being.

1184
01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:12.628
Mean. self-centered. no loyalty.

1185
01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:15.230
Short.

1186
01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:17.432
Too damn short for his own good.

1187
01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:19.668
Grace! Get
down here right away!

1188
01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:21.704
- I am coming!

1189
01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:24.172
What?

1190
01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.340
- Surprise!

1191
01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:26.175
Happy birthday!

1192
01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:30.646
- Oh.

1193
01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.850
- Oh come on.

1194
01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:37.218
- Open it!

1195
01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:38.987
Come on open it.

1196
01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:43.324
- Are these real?

1197
01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:44.160
- Yeah.

1198
01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:47.495
- Wow! You shouldn't have.

1199
01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:50.465
I haven't had a pearl
necklace in quite some time.

1200
01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.204
- Hi.

1201
01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:56.438
Hello.

1202
01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:57.439
Happy birthday.

1203
01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.007
- Oh. thank you.

1204
01:07:59.008 --> 01:08:01.009
Get back to work up there.

1205
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:02.078
- Good night.

1206
01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:04.480
- Happy birthday.

1207
01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:05.713
- Thank you.

1208
01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:06.715
- Thank you.

1209
01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:10.785
- What are you doing here?

1210
01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:14.189
- It's your birthday and I
got you a little something.

1211
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:16.826
Nice wrapping.

1212
01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:19.662
Okay.

1213
01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:26.868
Our high school yearbook?

1214
01:08:26.869 --> 01:08:28.069
- Give it back. I'll get
you something different.

1215
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:29.771
- No. no.
- Come now. no really.

1216
01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:30.939
- I want it.

1217
01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.273
Why?

1218
01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.775
- Well. I was trying to think.

1219
01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.009
what could I possibly get you
that you don't already have?

1220
01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:38.847
You know. me on a cop's
salary and you on yours.

1221
01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.081
- There's Jeff McEwen.

1222
01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.050
- And then I remembered

1223
01:08:41.051 --> 01:08:42.484
that you left school two weeks

1224
01:08:42.485 --> 01:08:45.186
before they gave the
yearbooks out. so. tadada.

1225
01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:46.988
- Bill Nowicki's right here.

1226
01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:49.825
- Yeah. I hear he's up
in Canada selling cars.

1227
01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.729
- Oh. Tammy Paul. I liked her.

1228
01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:56.965
- Oh. I hear that she died
actually. car accident.

1229
01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:57.833
- Oh.

1230
01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:03.037
Alex Racine. He was a nice guy.

1231
01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:04.272
- He's gone too.

1232
01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:06.709
- Oh. gee Keith. this
is a really great gift.

1233
01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:10.545
- They're mostly still
alive. you just have to...

1234
01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:12.080
- Okay.

1235
01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:15.750
Oh. there she is. Miranda
Scanlon. How's she doing?

1236
01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:16.951
- Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.

1237
01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:17.786
- And the kids?

1238
01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:20.655
- Almost out of the house.

1239
01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:24.025
- Well if she's there. then
I bet you are right here.

1240
01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:27.996
No. let me see.

1241
01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.265
You were really cute.

1242
01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:31.634
Didn't we go out once?

1243
01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:33.768
- To the Senior Prom.

1244
01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:34.603
- We did?

1245
01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:37.006
- Gracie. you invited me.

1246
01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:39.208
- Oh yeah.

1247
01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:41.677
That was fun.

1248
01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:46.048
You were nervous.

1249
01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:51.085
- It was my first time. y'know.

1250
01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:52.353
- I don't believe that.

1251
01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.355
- You couldn't tell?

1252
01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.727
- Whoo! You must've thought
I was some kind of slut.

1253
01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:01.530
sleeping with you
on the first date.

1254
01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:06.968
- No I'd say I had a bit of
a crush on you for a while.

1255
01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:08.204
- You never told me that!

1256
01:10:10.172 --> 01:10:11.273
- I was too shy.

1257
01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:14.242
You were this
really popular girl

1258
01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:15.643
and I was just this nerdy kid.

1259
01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:18.147
Lemme show you something here.

1260
01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:22.084
Voted "Most Beautiful."

1261
01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:31.259
- Wow!

1262
01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.861
How long'd you have
a crush on me for?

1263
01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:36.097
- For a while.

1264
01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:36.899
- A while?

1265
01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:41.103
Bet you never got over me.

1266
01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:43.105
- I never did.

1267
01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:47.843
- I'm sorry.

1268
01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:50.613
- Hey. there's nothing
to be sorry about.

1269
01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:55.817
- It's my birthday.

1270
01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:58.853
- Yes. Many happy returns.

1271
01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:04.559
- I wanna show you
something. Upstairs.

1272
01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.194
- What?

1273
01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:07.695
What do you gonna show me?

1274
01:11:07.696 --> 01:11:08.963
- Just relax. just
the music room.

1275
01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:09.798
- Wait. wait. wait.

1276
01:11:09.799 --> 01:11:11.032
What we gonna do?

1277
01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:13.434
- You ever give yourself
a really great gift?

1278
01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:14.669
- Yeah.

1279
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.137
- Like what?

1280
01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:18.273
- Just last month. I got myself
a new pair of hiking boots.

1281
01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:22.578
- No. I mean. a
really great gift.

1282
01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:25.281
- You know. Miranda's
probably wondering

1283
01:11:25.282 --> 01:11:26.548
where I am about now.

1284
01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:28.784
- It's just this yearbook.

1285
01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:32.186
It's like we're psychically
linked or something.

1286
01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:33.088
Tonight it's so...

1287
01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:34.857
- You think so?

1288
01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:38.059
- I just don't know
how I missed you.

1289
01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:38.894
- You what?

1290
01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:42.430
- Missed. That you
were thinking about me.

1291
01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:43.866
Come here. let's go.

1292
01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.267
- Gracie.
- No.

1293
01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:47.102
- Gracie. it's just.

1294
01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:47.936
- No. come on.

1295
01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:49.103
- Wait a minute.

1296
01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:50.973
- This is my private room.

1297
01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:56.679
- Wow.
- So.

1298
01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.447
did you ever fantasize about me?

1299
01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:03.485
Well. no. not in that way.

1300
01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.921
- What way then?

1301
01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:10.358
Well. y'know. I would see you
around town. or at the store.

1302
01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:13.429
Or up here. and I'd just wonder.

1303
01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:19.100
- What would you wonder?

1304
01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:21.769
- What it would've
been like for us.

1305
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.304
Just. stuff.

1306
01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:25.473
- Like. sex?

1307
01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:30.479
- No. more like. uh.
marriage. and kids and stuff.

1308
01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:34.582
- Marriage?

1309
01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.184
- Well yeah.

1310
01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:38.187
- I've got to be
honest with you. Keith.

1311
01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:40.356
I'm not the marrying type.

1312
01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:43.658
- But I bet you
could learn to be.

1313
01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.193
- I don't think so.

1314
01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.395
Never been able to spend
more than a couple months

1315
01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:48.197
with a guy.

1316
01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:51.400
I'm not that patient.

1317
01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:56.004
- Yeah. but you could be.
if you had the right guy.

1318
01:12:58.107 --> 01:12:59.074
- Oh. Keith.

1319
01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:03.044
Keith.

1320
01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:03.846
- What?

1321
01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:09.985
- I had this plan tonight.
I even took these drugs.

1322
01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.253
- Nothing illegal I hope.

1323
01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:15.124
- No. Fertility drugs.

1324
01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:17.693
- To have a baby?

1325
01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:20.896
- Yeah.

1326
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:23.065
To have a baby of my own.

1327
01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:26.834
I made an appointment.
with this old flame.

1328
01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:30.405
I had this list of all
the men in my past.

1329
01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:34.910
trying to find. you know.
the right genes. for my baby.

1330
01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:37.211
- And they're coming
over here tonight?

1331
01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:40.581
- No. No. He couldn't make it.

1332
01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:43.885
Guess I forgot to check
on his dependability gene.

1333
01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:50.893
You have such sweet eyes.

1334
01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:54.096
- Do I?

1335
01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:56.832
Well. thank you.

1336
01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.535
- I had forgotten about you.

1337
01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:03.371
I was making these
charts comparing IQ's

1338
01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:06.307
and bank accounts and
the size of a guy's nose.

1339
01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:10.879
And I think all I really
need for my baby is.

1340
01:14:12.981 --> 01:14:13.816
- Is what?

1341
01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.554
- Sweet-eyed kindness.

1342
01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:20.956
You could give that to me.

1343
01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:27.462
I just want someone
to pass it onto.

1344
01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:30.299
Otherwise. it just
disappears when we do.

1345
01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:35.037
- I can't do this.

1346
01:14:35.038 --> 01:14:36.337
- Don't. why not?

1347
01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:37.805
Why not?

1348
01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:39.974
There are men here every night.
doing things with my girls.

1349
01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:43.277
married men. they don't
think twice about it.

1350
01:14:43.278 --> 01:14:45.980
- That's them. it's not me.

1351
01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:47.081
And this is different.

1352
01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:48.583
This is really different.

1353
01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:50.885
- You'd never have to see us.

1354
01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:51.887
No one would know.

1355
01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:54.990
- I would know.

1356
01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:03.664
- Our baby would have your eyes.

1357
01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.300
- No. your eyes.

1358
01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:10.572
- Okay. my eyes. And
your strong hands.

1359
01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:12.875
Your goodness.

1360
01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:16.043
And my business sense.

1361
01:15:16.044 --> 01:15:18.179
- You are good at business.

1362
01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.515
- And you were smart at school.

1363
01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:24.886
so we'd have a strong.
smart. successful kid

1364
01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:26.822
with your hands and my eyes.

1365
01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:29.824
- This is getting
very complicated.

1366
01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:34.830
- No. no. baby. It's
simple. It's real simple.

1367
01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.133
'Cause I'm ready.

1368
01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:41.035
And you're ready.

1369
01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:42.304
And I want you.

1370
01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:47.976
- Miranda...

1371
01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:51.213
Miranda's...

1372
01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:55.050
Miranda's probably wondering
where I am about now.

1373
01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:00.622
- Yeah. Sure.

1374
01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:03.492
Give her my best.

1375
01:16:06.795 --> 01:16:10.264
- I don't think that she would
appreciate me visiting you.

1376
01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:11.632
- Don't give her my best then.

1377
01:16:11.633 --> 01:16:13.869
It'll be our secret.
it's sexier that way.

1378
01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:21.443
Keith.

1379
01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:23.579
I'm sorry.

1380
01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:44.032
Now I feel like
shit for nothing.

1381
01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:13.929
- Hey.

1382
01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:24.206
I forgot you have brown eyes.

1383
01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:28.310
Such beautiful.
beautiful brown eyes.

1384
01:17:58.607 --> 01:17:59.441
- Oh fuck.

1385
01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:02.711
I enjoyed your show tonight.

1386
01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:05.646
- Good for you.

1387
01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:07.215
- Now is that any
way to treat a fan?

1388
01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:12.853
- You don't exactly
look like a fan.

1389
01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:14.956
- What's a fan look like?

1390
01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:19.326
- I dunno. let's just say
you look too sophisticated.

1391
01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:21.696
So what are you doing down here?

1392
01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:24.565
- I'm in town for a couple
days for a convention.

1393
01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:26.668
- Oh. I heard. a high
tech thing. right?

1394
01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:29.603
Well. you don't look
like a computer geek.

1395
01:18:29.604 --> 01:18:31.839
- That's the second nicest
thing you've said to me.

1396
01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.641
- Well you don't. What are
you? Like a programmer?

1397
01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:36.510
- I'm. like. a CEO.

1398
01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:37.412
- You have any openings?

1399
01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:38.547
I'm looking for a new career.

1400
01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:41.248
- For someone with
your people skills?

1401
01:18:41.249 --> 01:18:43.085
I'm sure we can
find you something.

1402
01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.455
- Sorry. You caught
me at a weird time.

1403
01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:54.495
Hey. did you know that the
origin of the word career

1404
01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:56.064
is actually of a journey?

1405
01:18:57.165 --> 01:18:57.999
A road.

1406
01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:00.568
The road we travel.

1407
01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:01.803
- Construction ahead.

1408
01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.139
Why don't you take a vacation?

1409
01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:08.843
- Yeah. I'd last about
two days alone on a beach.

1410
01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:10.212
- I managed four days once.

1411
01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:13.080
Can't be alone.

1412
01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:15.249
And I can't be with someone.

1413
01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.218
It's terrible.

1414
01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.523
So are you gonna miss it?

1415
01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.091
- No.

1416
01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:25.493
You know I counted them tonight.

1417
01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:27.128
The tricks.

1418
01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:28.729
This one. I never
have to do again.

1419
01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:31.832
I'm done with the rings.
done with the ropes.

1420
01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:33.134
done with the doves.

1421
01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:34.202
No offense. Ralph.

1422
01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:37.972
Finito all card tricks.

1423
01:19:37.973 --> 01:19:40.875
- I think it's brave of
you to quit like that.

1424
01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:43.410
- We'll see how brave
I am in two months.

1425
01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:45.279
Is that why you stayed?
To tell me that?

1426
01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.149
- Partly. It's just.
you ever hear that joke?

1427
01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.450
What joke?

1428
01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:50.951
- You know.

1429
01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:52.553
Who do you have to fuck to
get out of the business?

1430
01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:54.488
- What business?

1431
01:19:54.489 --> 01:19:55.490
- Any business.

1432
01:19:57.759 --> 01:20:00.694
- Okay. is there a
punchline to this joke?

1433
01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.230
- No. That is the joke.

1434
01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:05.399
Who do you have to.
you know. to get...

1435
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.334
- To get out. who do you
have to fuck to get out. oh.

1436
01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:08.669
- Yeah.

1437
01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:09.504
- That's funny.

1438
01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:13.107
Could have used that one
in my routine tonight.

1439
01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:15.376
- Well. tonight you answered
that question for me.

1440
01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:16.410
- I did?

1441
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:17.212
- Yeah.

1442
01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:19.481
The answer is. no one.

1443
01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:21.715
You don't need to fuck anyone

1444
01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:23.251
to do what you know
you need to do.

1445
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.655
- Glad to see I could help.

1446
01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.391
- So where are you going?

1447
01:20:30.392 --> 01:20:32.326
- I dunno. New York maybe.

1448
01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:36.598
- No. I mean. where are
you going right now?

1449
01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:39.800
- You want to get a
drink or something?

1450
01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:40.769
- I wanna get dinner.

1451
01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:42.671
- You buying?

1452
01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:45.540
- How 'bout we go dutch?

1453
01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:47.275
What's your name?

1454
01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:51.146
- Can't you read? It's
Magno the Magnificent.

1455
01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:54.249
Or Jack.

1456
01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:58.552
What's your name?
- Nancy.

1457
01:20:58.553 --> 01:21:01.356
- When I was a kid. I used to
have a crush on Nancy Drew.

1458
01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:05.125
- Hope I can live up
to your expectations.

1459
01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:06.827
You forget. I
am done with mystery.

1460
01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:09.897
And I have absolutely
no expectations.

1461
01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:13.468
As of tonight. I am a
blank slate. A tabula rasa.

1462
01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:17.404
- In that case. Jack. let's go.

1463
01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:18.773
I am starving.

1464
01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:24.111
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

1465
01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:25.814
- Right. Just dinner.

1466
01:21:37.792 --> 01:21:39.961
It's in case you get cold.

1467
01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:49.069
My God.

1468
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.838
- What?

1469
01:21:51.806 --> 01:21:53.041
- What if it's a boy?

1470
01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:16.831
- That's it. come
on in. have a seat.

1471
01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:20.501
Where's the fucking chair.
get her a chair. goddammit!

1472
01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:21.735
That stupid bitch
moved the chair.

1473
01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:24.238
Somebody ought to nail
the fucking thing down!

1474
01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:26.006
Why don't you make yourself
useful and get me a cappuccino!

1475
01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:28.742
Make sure it's hot. the
last one. fucking cold.

1476
01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:29.577
Hot!

1477
01:22:31.179 --> 01:22:32.413
Yes!

1478
01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:34.682
Your agent sent me your resume.

1479
01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:36.184
Where's the fucking resume?

1480
01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:41.221
You're very beautiful.

1481
01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:42.690
You must get a lot of
compliments around this town.

1482
01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:44.658
Lots of attention.
How tall are you?

1483
01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:47.995
Now with heels on. you're
quite. well. quite statuesque.

1484
01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:49.430
Of course. you know this
could be a slight problem

1485
01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:51.265
with our star.

1486
01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:53.500
He's a bit. well. short.

1487
01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:55.169
Practically a dwarf
in comparison to you.

1488
01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:56.670
On the other hand.

1489
01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:58.205
the scene is mostly of a
lying down nature. isn't it?

1490
01:22:58.206 --> 01:23:02.344
We'll just put a pin in the
whole. height issue. shall we?

1491
01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:07.082
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1492
01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:18.959
Beautiful dress you have on.

1493
01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.661
Very elegant. Shows off
your legs quite nicely.

1494
01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:21.795
Is that your own hair?

1495
01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:23.163
I hope you don't mind my asking.

1496
01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:25.132
just these days with extensions.
you can't really tell.

1497
01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:32.374
Hello?

1498
01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:35.042
Mother?

1499
01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:35.977
Yes.

1500
01:23:35.978 --> 01:23:38.213
Listen. can I call you back?

1501
01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:46.820
I'm in the middle
of working. mother.

1502
01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:48.656
I'll call you back. yes. yeah.

1503
01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:53.561
Yeah. yes. love
you too... Good-bye.

1504
01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:04.205
Well. let's have
you read. shall we?

1505
01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:10.745
- How far do you
wanna take this?

1506
01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:13.348
- Excuse me?

1507
01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:15.883
- The director thing.

1508
01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:17.552
That's cool. very cool.

1509
01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:26.761
Mr. Director. oh. I really.
really want this role.

1510
01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:37.705
- You are an
actress. aren't you?

1511
01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:43.044
- You did call
Grace. didn't you?

1512
01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:49.451
- Grace is your. uh... manager?

1513
01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:55.723
- Oh. I am really. really sorry.

1514
01:24:57.125 --> 01:25:00.562
There's no charge.
There'll be no charge.

1515
01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:07.569
- Actually. you really could be.

1516
01:25:10.805 --> 01:25:11.639
- Yes?

1517
01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:16.644
- Do you have any
problem with nudity?

1518
01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:26.988
- No problem.

1519
01:25:28.623 --> 01:25:29.557
No problem.

1520
01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:33.160
No problem here.

1521
01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:35.029
Oh. that'll cost you extra.

1522
01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:37.198
No problem.

1523
01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:39.334
I can handle it.

1524
01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:47.208
- Well. um. we could
meet up over there?

1525
01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:53.648
Say. after the day's
over. at my place.

1526
01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:57.217
learn a bit more about the role.

1527
01:25:57.218 --> 01:25:58.919
And you. I mean.

1528
01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.889
you really are quite
right for the part.

1529
01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:04.491
I just really would
need to read you.

1530
01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:08.095
I mean have you read something
