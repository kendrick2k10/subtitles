KELSA: One of the reasons
I like animals so much

5
00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:43.836

Here are some
of my favorites.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:49.133

357
00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:04.821
I've been on hormone blockers
for two months

358
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:10.952
and I haven't felt any changes
in my mood or personality.

359
00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:14.122
I'm not more emotional
or calmer.

360
00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:17.167
I think more of that will come
once I'm on estrogen.

361
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.879
I have to decide whether
to take pills or shots.

362

They say shots
are more smooth sailing.

363

375
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.617

naturally come up.

376

And I'm not even worried
about harassment

377
00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.246
or anything like that.

378
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.957
I'm worried about people
only pretending to like me

379
00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.876
because they wanna be woke
or something.

380
00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:03.838

far away.

381

and no one knows my tea.
I could go stealth.

382
00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:12.138
But that would mean
nobody would know me.

383

of not being known

386

or the existential despair

387
00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:29.155
of being known
and being rejected?

388
00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:31.116

in the real world.

389

1922
01:24:15.593 --> 01:24:17.386

for Thanksgiving.

meets someone else

and breaks
the other one's heart.

very. very complicated.

in my life.

in this world.

I know it's gonna be hard.

1933
01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:54.298
but I don't want
to just exist.

1934
01:24:56.467 --> 01:24:59.303
I need to find out
what else I'm capable of.

1936

you know. there's something
about you that I don't know.

Um. don't mind
the new background.

1978
01:28:23.966 --> 01:28:26.593
I did move
into a college dorm.

1979

last year

by someone I love.

1986
01:28:44.653 --> 01:28:48.574

over fields and reed beds.

1991
01:28:57.916 --> 01:29:01.420
And it's known for its sharp
and precise hunting.

1992
01:29:01.503 --> 01:29:04.048
as well as its daring
courtship displays.

from a foggy gray

1997
01:29:15.934 --> 01:29:18.979
to the creamy brown likeness
of the female.

1998
01:29:19.063 --> 01:29:22.524
So. I like to say
my favorite animal

1999
01:29:22.608 --> 01:29:24.443
is the marsh harrier

2000
01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:30.032
