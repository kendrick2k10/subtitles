3
00:00:57.231 --> 00:00:59.450
I call this meeting

4
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.018
of the Boonton. Pennsylvania
City Council to order.

5
00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:03.280
Please stand.

6
00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:11.680
I pledge
allegiance to the flag of
the United States of America

7
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.596
and to the republic
for which it stands.

8
00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:17.077
First item on the agenda.

9
00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:20.602
an update to the construction
of the baseball field
on Juniper Street.

10
00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:24.127
With us is Steve Gorham.
general contractor.

11
00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.914
As promised.
we will not be needing
an extension on construction.

12
00:01:28.914 --> 00:01:30.699
We will finish by November 1.

13
00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:33.484
within the period furnished
by our previous extension.

14
00:01:33.484 --> 00:01:36.226
What lies ahead is electrical.
plumbing. not including

15
00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:38.707
- exterior bathrooms...

16
00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:40.839
...gonna be
some congestion...

17
00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:43.712
...we'll divide it
into four subsections.

18
00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:48.108
We now move to the next
part of the meeting.
which is open public comments.

19
00:01:49.065 --> 00:01:52.895
The Council will hear comments.
but is not expected to respond.

20
00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:57.117
Please remember to
limit your comments to
one and a half minutes.

21
00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:03.993
I think that we ought
to change our town slogan.

22
00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:06.865
"A Great Place To Call Home"
is confusing

23
00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:09.041
because when somebody hears it.

24
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:11.131
it can mean that
it's a great place

25
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.959
to call your home
on the telephone.

26
00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.006
I suggest a clearer motto.

27
00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:19.965
like "A Great Place
to Refer to as Home."

28
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.924
Though it doesn't
have to be that.

29
00:02:23.404 --> 00:02:26.146
We need a crosswalk
on Trent Avenue

30
00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.625
between Frost and Allegheny.

31
00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:33.240
It's a very long distance to
walk when you're in the middle
and you need to cross

32
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.633
and you either need to get
to Frost or Allegheny.

33
00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:38.984
It encourages jaywalking.
and jaywalking is
an expensive ticket.

34
00:02:38.984 --> 00:02:40.638
and I know
'cause I've gotten three.

35
00:02:40.638 --> 00:02:43.685
Not to mention
a great way to get you killed.

36
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:46.427
Thank you.

37
00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:48.358
<i>This is the second major
glacier collapse in a week...</i>

38
00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:50.752
All right. Dad.
I'm ready for you.

39
00:03:50.752 --> 00:03:54.538
<i>...can expect to see happening
in other parts of the world?</i>

40
00:03:54.538 --> 00:03:56.236
Okay.

41
00:03:59.108 --> 00:04:00.501
Here.

42
00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:07.203
Your gas bill. your phone bill.
and your Medicare supplement.

43
00:04:07.203 --> 00:04:08.900
in case you're interested.

44
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.988
Hmm?

45
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:21.261
Have you heard from Tim?

46
00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:25.439
No.

47
00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:29.747
It costs a lot to make
a long-distance call.

48
00:04:29.747 --> 00:04:31.358
so I understand.

49
00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:38.713
Okay. Well. I have to use
the girl's room before I go.

50
00:04:52.553 --> 00:04:53.815
Dad?

51
00:04:54.642 --> 00:04:57.209
I found this
in the bathroom cabinet.

52
00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:58.689
Oh.

53
00:05:00.082 --> 00:05:01.692
Any idea why you put it there?

54
00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.522
I must've just gotten confused.

55
00:05:07.132 --> 00:05:09.352
Maybe the kitchen cabinets
were full.

56
00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:11.441
There's plenty of space in 'em.

57
00:05:12.616 --> 00:05:14.575
Well.
I must have been distracted.

58
00:05:16.272 --> 00:05:18.361
- Are you feeling okay. Dad?
- Yeah.

59
00:05:19.536 --> 00:05:21.843
You think that maybe
you should go get a checkup

60
00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:24.454
- to see how you're doing?
- I don't need a checkup.

61
00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:27.414
- Well. it can't hurt.
though. right?
- I don't need it.

62
00:05:31.243 --> 00:05:35.900
Well. I'm late for work.
But you let me know if
there's anything else you need.

63
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.337
All right.

64
00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.262
<i>All right. y'all.
Uh. okay. well.
we're gonna take a call now.</i>

65
00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.581
<i>Now. we swabbed
the area around his neck
to check for DNA.</i>

66
00:06:05.452 --> 00:06:08.063
<i>Would you care to give us
a sample for comparison?</i>

67
00:07:11.996 --> 00:07:13.215
Oh. my.

68
00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.465
Oh. my.

69
00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:53.473
<i>911 operator.
what is your emergency?</i>

70
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:57.346
There is a spaceship
that's crashed in my backyard.

71
00:07:57.346 --> 00:07:59.479
And it has crushed my azaleas.

72
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.742
-  <i>A spaceship?</i>
- Yes.

73
00:08:01.742 --> 00:08:06.877
<i>Sir.
placing prank calls to 911
emergency services is a felony.</i>

74
00:08:06.877 --> 00:08:12.492
It's not a prank. A spaceship
has crashed in my backyard.
and it has crushed my azaleas.

75
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.799
<i>Sir. please try
lying down and go back to sleep.</i>

76
00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:18.019
- I'm wide awake.

77
00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:19.237
Hello?

78
00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:22.893
Hello? [clears throat] Hello?

79
00:08:34.165 --> 00:08:36.820
<i>Denise is unavailable.</i>

80
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.996
<i>- The voicemail is full--</i>

81
00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:09.026
I have been talking to you
about pickleball

82
00:09:09.026 --> 00:09:13.770
for the past four years. and you
haven't done nothin' about it.

83
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.904
Pickleball is a fantastic sport

84
00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:20.516
for those of us
whose knees aren't agile enough

85
00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:22.387
to get us across
the tennis court.

86
00:09:22.387 --> 00:09:25.260
Who's filibustering pickleball?

87
00:09:26.435 --> 00:09:28.002
Is that you. Wu?

88
00:09:29.177 --> 00:09:32.702
The new cold storage facility
near the highway

89
00:09:32.702 --> 00:09:36.227
is going to give our businesses
a marvelous way

90
00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:38.360
to store their perishable goods.

91
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.407
But it also gives us
another thing:

92
00:09:42.407 --> 00:09:44.975
a giant wall.

93
00:09:44.975 --> 00:09:48.065
I wonder if this council
would consider

94
00:09:48.065 --> 00:09:51.721
commissioning a muralist
to add a little magic

95
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:56.247
to what will already be
a valuable building.

96
00:09:58.032 --> 00:10:02.166
I think we ought to
change our town slogan.

97
00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:05.430
"A Great Place To Call Home"
is confusing

98
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.607
because when somebody hears it.

99
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.739
it can mean that
it's a great place

100
00:10:09.739 --> 00:10:12.263
to call your home
on the telephone.

101
00:10:12.263 --> 00:10:13.961
I suggest a clearer motto.

102
00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:16.964
like "A Great Place
to Refer to as Home."

103
00:10:16.964 --> 00:10:21.011
Though. um.
it doesn't have to be that.

104
00:10:22.883 --> 00:10:25.668
We need a crosswalk
on Trent Avenue

105
00:10:25.668 --> 00:10:27.365
between Frost and Allegheny...

106
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:41.962
<i>Denise is unavailable.</i>

107
00:11:41.962 --> 00:11:43.790
<i>The voicemail is full.</i>

108
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.009
- Yeah? Hi. Denise--

109
00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:49.796
I called you
a few nights ago because

110
00:11:50.666 --> 00:11:55.192
a spaceship had crashed
in my backyard.

111
00:11:55.192 --> 00:11:56.759
Well. now...

112
00:11:57.629 --> 00:12:00.720
a space man
has come out of the ship.

113
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.113
and he's lying on my patio.

114
00:12:05.202 --> 00:12:06.421
I'm scared.

115
00:12:08.597 --> 00:12:10.120
I don't know what to do.

116
00:12:11.426 --> 00:12:14.342
Anyway... call me.

117
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.314
How are you. Milton?

118
00:12:30.314 --> 00:12:33.013
Well. I'll tell you.

119
00:12:33.013 --> 00:12:35.711
- I've g--
I've got a real situation.

120
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:39.019
I call this meeting
of the Boonton City Council
to order.

121
00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:41.238
Esteemed Council members.

122
00:12:41.238 --> 00:12:46.243
I am delighted
to speak to you tonight
about elderly-youth connections.

123
00:12:46.243 --> 00:12:50.813
I hope eventually to collaborate
with this board on this project.

124
00:12:50.813 --> 00:12:55.426
but in the meantime.
I am launching a pilot project.

125
00:12:55.426 --> 00:12:59.343
I will be placing
these posters around town

126
00:12:59.343 --> 00:13:01.781
in order to connect
with a young person

127
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:05.088
who would like to learn from me.
and I from them.

128
00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:09.789
I will keep you updated
on this exciting project.

129
00:13:11.268 --> 00:13:12.313
Thank you.

130
00:13:18.275 --> 00:13:21.757
We should change the town motto
to something clearer.

131
00:13:21.757 --> 00:13:24.107
because
"A Great Place to Call Home"

132
00:13:24.107 --> 00:13:26.327
can mean you're calling home.

133
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.244
I feel there needs
to be a crosswalk

134
00:13:30.244 --> 00:13:33.943
on Trent Avenue
between Frost and Allegheny.

135
00:13:33.943 --> 00:13:36.119
I feel it is too far

136
00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:39.166
between Frost and Allegheny.

137
00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:42.343
and-- and-- and it encourages
people to jaywalk.

138
00:13:42.343 --> 00:13:43.474
and they can die.

139
00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:50.525
Also.
a UFO has crashed in my backyard

140
00:13:50.525 --> 00:13:54.703
and has taken out my azaleas
and has destroyed my bird bath.

141
00:13:59.012 --> 00:14:01.841
- Did you just say "UFO"?
- Yes.

142
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.974
It has crashed in my backyard

143
00:14:04.974 --> 00:14:08.586
and taken out my azaleas
and destroyed my bird bath.

144
00:14:27.562 --> 00:14:29.607
You should not talk like that!

145
00:14:29.607 --> 00:14:32.872
When you talk like that.
it makes them all
take us less seriously.

146
00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:37.528
But it's true. A spaceship
crashed in my backyard
and crushed my azaleas.

147
00:14:37.528 --> 00:14:40.488
I'm dead serious!
You should not talk like that.

148
00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:42.664
It is not good.

149
00:14:42.664 --> 00:14:44.884
What should I do?
Not tell anybody?

150
00:14:47.974 --> 00:14:50.977
Good night. Joyce.
See you next week.

151
00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:53.414
Milton?

152
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.026
- You want a ride?
- I can walk.

153
00:14:57.026 --> 00:15:00.595
I can give you a lift.
It's no problem at all.

154
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.664
- Is everything okay. Milt?
-  Yeah.

155
00:15:26.664 --> 00:15:28.884
You feeling well?

156
00:15:28.884 --> 00:15:31.452
Except for this situation
with the spaceship.

157
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:37.980
If there's anything I can do.
you let me know.

158
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.635
I suppose.

159
00:15:47.598 --> 00:15:49.557
You take care. Milt.

160
00:17:28.699 --> 00:17:29.744
Oh. my.

161
00:17:45.325 --> 00:17:48.458
It's warmer inside.
Do you wanna come inside?

162
00:17:53.898 --> 00:17:57.424
Do you wanna come inside?
'Cause it's warmer in here.

163
00:18:09.914 --> 00:18:11.438
I'm not sure what to do.

164
00:18:12.395 --> 00:18:15.094
This hasn't
happened to me before.

165
00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.487
- Shoot!

166
00:18:25.365 --> 00:18:27.845
That was the kettle. Sorry.

167
00:18:30.457 --> 00:18:33.721
I saw you'd finished your water.
so maybe you want more.

168
00:18:39.292 --> 00:18:41.294
Looks like I was right.

169
00:18:53.784 --> 00:18:56.352
I brought you
a bunch of different things

170
00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:58.485
'cause I wasn't sure
what you'd eat.

171
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:12.238
You liked the apples.

172
00:19:15.197 --> 00:19:17.330
That was the last one.

173
00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.480
-  Hey. Clarence!
- I'm Milt.

174
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.960
Okay.

175
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.483
That's a lot of apples!

176
00:19:40.483 --> 00:19:43.225
They're for the alien
that's back in my house.

177
00:19:43.225 --> 00:19:45.488
You mean an illegal alien. or...

178
00:19:45.488 --> 00:19:49.188
No.
Like. an alien from outer space.

179
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:53.322
A ship crashed in my backyard
a couple nights ago.

180
00:19:53.322 --> 00:19:55.542
and an alien came
crawling out of it.

181
00:19:55.542 --> 00:19:58.806
and so far. the only thing
he eats is apples.

182
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.903
Be $11.32.

183
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.389
<i>The government is searching for
pieces of a weather satellite</i>

184
00:20:16.389 --> 00:20:18.913
<i>they say disintegrated
over Western Pennsylvania.</i>

185
00:20:18.913 --> 00:20:22.743
<i>They ask that anyone
who comes across parts of
the fallen device not touch it.</i>

186
00:20:22.743 --> 00:20:26.442
<i>During the time you were
incarcerated. you were
also receiving disability.</i>

187
00:20:26.442 --> 00:20:30.707
<i>- Yes.</i>

188
00:20:30.707 --> 00:20:32.883
-  <i>Here in McKinley--</i>

189
00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:37.975
I'm sorry.

190
00:20:39.194 --> 00:20:42.110
I'm just...

191
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.417
...u-- used to living alone.

192
00:20:47.724 --> 00:20:48.769
You're walking.

193
00:20:51.946 --> 00:20:53.252
That's a good sign.

194
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:55.863
Maybe I'll show you around.

195
00:20:55.863 --> 00:20:57.865
This is the bathroom.

196
00:20:57.865 --> 00:20:59.388
You got hot water. cold.

197
00:20:59.388 --> 00:21:01.912
If the hot doesn't
come out right away.

198
00:21:01.912 --> 00:21:03.479
just give it a minute.

199
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.352
Here's where you
do your business.

200
00:21:09.355 --> 00:21:12.183
There's things to read.
if it takes a while.

201
00:21:12.183 --> 00:21:14.403
This is the guest bedroom.

202
00:21:14.403 --> 00:21:18.277
If you need to stay the night.
this is where you'll sleep.

203
00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:22.803
It was a gift.

204
00:21:24.674 --> 00:21:28.374
The backyard. you already know.
That's where you crashed
into my azaleas.

205
00:21:28.374 --> 00:21:30.637
We'll have a word
about that later.

206
00:21:30.637 --> 00:21:32.116
The kitchen.

207
00:21:32.116 --> 00:21:35.598
Here's where
I leave myself reminders.

208
00:21:35.598 --> 00:21:37.600
And this is the living room.

209
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.124
I mainly use it to watch TV.

210
00:21:40.864 --> 00:21:44.128
And you use this one
to control everything.

211
00:21:44.128 --> 00:21:48.089
The only thing you use this one
for is to change the volume.

212
00:21:48.089 --> 00:21:53.921
If you change anything else.
then I have to call Denise over
and she gets irritated with me.

213
00:21:55.662 --> 00:21:58.055
This channel shows the news
that's happening.

214
00:21:58.969 --> 00:22:03.278
This channel's the same. but
the people are a little angrier.

215
00:22:03.278 --> 00:22:06.586
This channel shows
<i>CSI</i> three times a day.

216
00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:09.240
I like <i>CSI</i> because
it always surprises me.

217
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.680
You think it's going this way.
but suddenly-- Ooh!
It's going this way instead.

218
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.466
Oh.

219
00:22:18.249 --> 00:22:19.555
This is my family.

220
00:22:20.687 --> 00:22:22.819
She unfortunately
has passed away.

221
00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:26.345
She lives in town.
He lives in California.

222
00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:28.521
Moved there
about ten years ago for a job.

223
00:22:28.521 --> 00:22:30.174
I don't hear from him much.

224
00:22:30.174 --> 00:22:32.263
Th-- that's--
That's okay.

225
00:22:32.263 --> 00:22:33.830
Young people are busy.

226
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.484
I was busy at his age.

227
00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:39.270
Oh! It's seven o'clock.

228
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.707
I forgot to tell you...

229
00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:44.450
about the dance show.

230
00:22:53.241 --> 00:22:55.069
- Hey. Denise!
-  Hi. Dave!

231
00:22:55.069 --> 00:22:56.549
How's the clinic going?

232
00:22:56.549 --> 00:23:00.857
Well. so far I've had
two neuters and three spays.

233
00:23:00.857 --> 00:23:03.033
and the day's only half over. so...

234
00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:08.125
Uh...
your dad was in here earlier.

235
00:23:08.125 --> 00:23:11.520
He said some stuff which
struck me as a little strange.

236
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.741
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. I don't mean to
make a mountain out of it.

237
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:17.526
but he said he was buying apples

238
00:23:17.526 --> 00:23:19.920
for an alien
that was staying with him.

239
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.530
Like an illegal alien?

240
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.751
No.
like an alien from outer space.

241
00:23:25.708 --> 00:23:28.102
Do you think that he was joking?

242
00:23:30.104 --> 00:23:31.584
He didn't seem to be joking.

243
00:23:39.896 --> 00:23:42.029
-  Oh. hi. Denise.
- Listen.

244
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.858
Dad. I don't wanna argue.

245
00:23:46.076 --> 00:23:49.906
You're 78 years old.
and you haven't seen a doctor
in three years.

246
00:23:49.906 --> 00:23:52.779
Please let me
schedule you a checkup.

247
00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:57.479
And I'll take you.
and they'll check you out.
and that'll be that.

248
00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:00.439
But I'm fine. Denise.
I don't need a doctor.

249
00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:03.920
Well. if you're fine.
then they'll tell you
that you're fine.

250
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.182
and that'll be that!

251
00:24:05.966 --> 00:24:08.882
And I'm not taking no
for an answer.

252
00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:13.147
Well. I'd rather say no.
but in that case. I guess.

253
00:24:15.105 --> 00:24:16.150
Thank you.

254
00:24:18.413 --> 00:24:19.936
Did you get my message?

255
00:24:20.763 --> 00:24:23.723
No. Did it say that
my mailbox was full?

256
00:24:23.723 --> 00:24:27.074
Remember. if my mailbox is full.
I'm not gonna get the message.

257
00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:29.772
- Um...

258
00:24:29.772 --> 00:24:32.253
All right. you should get that.
And I'm late.

259
00:24:32.253 --> 00:24:34.429
I'll talk to you later. okay?

260
00:24:34.429 --> 00:24:35.996
Oh. okay.

261
00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:45.962
- Hello?
-  <i>Hi. Milt. it's Sandy.</i>

262
00:24:45.962 --> 00:24:47.094
Oh.

263
00:24:47.877 --> 00:24:49.618
I found your number
in the phonebook.

264
00:24:49.618 --> 00:24:51.490
I hope you don't mind
I'm calling.

265
00:24:52.795 --> 00:24:55.842
- No.
-  <i>Milton. do you happen
to have a printer?</i>

266
00:24:56.843 --> 00:24:58.409
A printer?

267
00:24:58.409 --> 00:25:00.324
<i>Let me see.</i>

268
00:25:00.324 --> 00:25:02.588
<i>Denise set me up
with a lot of things</i>

269
00:25:02.588 --> 00:25:04.503
when she stopped using them.

270
00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:06.548
Yeah. I have a printer.

271
00:25:06.548 --> 00:25:09.377
Oh!
Mine stopped working long ago.

272
00:25:09.377 --> 00:25:11.161
Computer stopped recognizing it.

273
00:25:11.945 --> 00:25:14.643
<i>Anyhow. do-- do you think
I could use yours?</i>

274
00:25:14.643 --> 00:25:17.777
It's for the poster
for the program.

275
00:25:19.387 --> 00:25:21.171
Don't they have one
in the library?

276
00:25:21.911 --> 00:25:24.871
<i>I don't think
they still have one.</i>

277
00:25:26.046 --> 00:25:28.178
If-- if it's a problem--

278
00:25:28.178 --> 00:25:31.399
It-- it isn't a problem.
I guess.

279
00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:35.925
-  Hey. Milt.
- Hi. Sandy.

280
00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:39.538
Uh... I really wish
these machines would warn you

281
00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:42.236
before they screw themselves up
like that.

282
00:25:42.236 --> 00:25:44.891
I'll probably print about 22.
On my way through town.

283
00:25:44.891 --> 00:25:47.023
I thought of an another
couple of places to--

284
00:25:47.023 --> 00:25:50.374
Oh. good Christ!
What the fuck is that?

285
00:25:51.288 --> 00:25:54.553
You remember the spaceship
that crashed in my yard?

286
00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:57.468
This is the little man
who came out of it.

287
00:25:57.468 --> 00:25:59.383
This is Sandy.

288
00:25:59.383 --> 00:26:01.342
She's an acquaintance of mine.

289
00:26:04.258 --> 00:26:06.260
Milton. what is this?

290
00:26:07.087 --> 00:26:10.786
Uh. this is an alien from space.
I suppose.

291
00:26:13.006 --> 00:26:15.051
How long
has he been here?

292
00:26:15.051 --> 00:26:17.140
Oh. for a few days.

293
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.754
Though the first couple days
he was inside the spaceship.

294
00:26:22.842 --> 00:26:26.367
Mm-hmm. And he's just
sitting on your couch?

295
00:26:26.367 --> 00:26:28.848
Yeah. He's very friendly.

296
00:26:28.848 --> 00:26:30.893
He watches whatever I watch.

297
00:26:31.677 --> 00:26:33.722
He's undemanding.

298
00:26:33.722 --> 00:26:36.290
Oh. my Lord.
I think I need to sit down.

299
00:26:42.078 --> 00:26:43.602
Oh. my God. Milton.

300
00:26:43.602 --> 00:26:46.692
This-- this is a very big thing.

301
00:26:46.692 --> 00:26:48.824
Yeah. I suppose it is.

302
00:26:48.824 --> 00:26:52.175
This is a being

303
00:26:52.175 --> 00:26:54.961
from a-- another galaxy.

304
00:26:56.484 --> 00:26:58.573
This has never happened before.

305
00:26:58.573 --> 00:27:00.096
I guess that's true.

306
00:27:02.316 --> 00:27:04.100
And there's a ship?

307
00:27:09.802 --> 00:27:12.935
- Oh. dear God.
-  Yep.

308
00:27:12.935 --> 00:27:16.852
I think it'll be a couple
seasons before they grow back.

309
00:27:21.204 --> 00:27:24.120
When he arrived.
he wasn't doing nearly so well.

310
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.384
He was really banged up
from the crash landing.

311
00:27:27.384 --> 00:27:31.345
But he's been
eating apples ever since.
and I guess they've helped him.

312
00:27:31.345 --> 00:27:33.303
- Apples?
- Yeah.

313
00:27:35.305 --> 00:27:36.829
And you wanna keep him here?

314
00:27:36.829 --> 00:27:38.308
As long as he wants to.

315
00:27:38.308 --> 00:27:40.615
Mmm. I don't know about that.

316
00:27:40.615 --> 00:27:43.096
He may be a threat.
We don't know.

317
00:27:43.096 --> 00:27:44.445
I really doubt it.

318
00:27:47.578 --> 00:27:52.148
Listen. Milton. if you wanna
keep him here. you've got to
stop telling people about him.

319
00:27:52.148 --> 00:27:56.457
No more just letting people
come over like you did with me.

320
00:27:56.457 --> 00:27:59.808
I-- I've seen what people do
with these kinds of guys.

321
00:27:59.808 --> 00:28:01.680
This has happened to you before?

322
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.290
No!

323
00:28:04.117 --> 00:28:08.382
From the movies. and the-- the
movies are based on something.

324
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.864
He's gotta be a secret.

325
00:28:12.734 --> 00:28:14.257
No more telling anyone.

326
00:28:14.257 --> 00:28:17.217
You know. and I know. and...

327
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.874
...I'm not telling anybody.

328
00:28:33.537 --> 00:28:36.366
Hmm. Sandy?

329
00:28:46.768 --> 00:28:48.770
Are you sure it's safe?

330
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.903
Far as I can tell.

331
00:28:51.817 --> 00:28:53.949
he's really far from home.

332
00:28:53.949 --> 00:28:56.430
Seems like he would
be the scared one.

333
00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.738
I'll see you soon. Milt.

334
00:29:02.436 --> 00:29:03.916
And remember.

335
00:29:04.786 --> 00:29:07.441
don't tell anybody.

336
00:29:07.441 --> 00:29:08.964
I won't.

337
00:29:30.464 --> 00:29:33.119
<i>His eyes were shaped
like you see in the movies.</i>

338
00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:35.730
<i>It hovered in the sky
right above the house.</i>

339
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.427
<i>It was round
like a cylinder.</i>

340
00:29:37.427 --> 00:29:39.603
<i>Had lights
all the way around it.</i>

341
00:29:39.603 --> 00:29:42.998
<i>and it had a dome on top of it
with a bright light shining out.</i>

342
00:29:48.134 --> 00:29:52.225
<i>The government now says
it was a security satellite
and not a weather satellite</i>

343
00:29:52.225 --> 00:29:55.271
<i>that crashed somewhere
in Western Pennsylvania.
They ask anyone...</i>

344
00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:58.797
That was Sandy.
I think you'll like her.

345
00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:00.320
<i>...call the number below.</i>

346
00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.626
-  <i>But she did.</i>

347
00:30:02.626 --> 00:30:05.629
<i>She did tell you everything
she knew about the autopsy.</i>

348
00:30:05.629 --> 00:30:09.111
<i>- She wanted to help.</i>
-  <i>You're sure
she wanted to help.</i>

349
00:30:09.111 --> 00:30:11.418
<i>or had she simply
exhausted her options. Robert?</i>

350
00:30:11.418 --> 00:30:14.464
<i>That's right. John.
She exhausted her options.</i>

351
00:30:14.464 --> 00:30:17.119
<i>Nothing she could do was
going to fix what she did.</i>

352
00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:19.818
<i>So why help now? 'Cause she
honestly wanted to do good.</i>

353
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:24.344
<i>Robert. I'm sorry. but
I'm not buying it for a second.
I know she's your daughter.</i>

354
00:30:24.344 --> 00:30:27.826
-  <i>Damn right
she's my daughter.</i>
-  <i>But it can't happen.</i>

355
00:31:14.742 --> 00:31:16.265
Good morning.

356
00:31:21.009 --> 00:31:24.012
Repairs have begun. That's good.

357
00:31:24.795 --> 00:31:27.059
I hope you can fix it.

358
00:31:27.059 --> 00:31:30.584
Must not be easy to be
stuck on a different planet.

359
00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:35.937
Thank you for the picture.

360
00:31:35.937 --> 00:31:37.896
It's very beautiful.

361
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.684
I'm gonna put some coffee on.

362
00:31:55.174 --> 00:31:57.916
We're looking for differences.

363
00:31:57.916 --> 00:32:00.919
Could you circle the one
that's different. please?

364
00:32:14.628 --> 00:32:16.282
I'm gonna show you four objects.

365
00:32:19.111 --> 00:32:22.941
Do me a favor. Milton.
and remember these objects.

366
00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:33.952
Now I'm going to show you a new
paper with three of the objects.

367
00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:36.650
You tell me
which one is missing.

368
00:32:51.143 --> 00:32:54.015
Jump rope.
The word is jump rope.

369
00:32:54.015 --> 00:32:55.364
You have that?

370
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:58.498
Yeah.

371
00:32:59.803 --> 00:33:02.241
I'm going to
tell you a short story.

372
00:33:05.331 --> 00:33:08.595
A young girl went
to the store to buy grapes.

373
00:33:08.595 --> 00:33:12.294
When she got there.
she didn't have enough money.

374
00:33:12.294 --> 00:33:14.775
so she bought milk instead.

375
00:33:14.775 --> 00:33:17.517
At home.
her mother asked what happened.

376
00:33:18.257 --> 00:33:22.261
Milton. what was the word
I asked you to remember?

377
00:33:40.366 --> 00:33:43.369
It must be strange for you.

378
00:33:43.369 --> 00:33:46.589
having me here
and-- and Milton gone.

379
00:33:46.589 --> 00:33:48.591
He'll be back shortly. He--

380
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:53.292
he just had a-- an appointment
he had to go to.

381
00:33:55.903 --> 00:33:57.557
Do you understand me?

382
00:33:58.906 --> 00:34:02.040
With those eyes.
it-- it seems like you do.

383
00:34:04.694 --> 00:34:09.699
Well. since you can't talk.
I guess I will.

384
00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:11.658
Um...

385
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:20.275
I have a daughter.

386
00:34:20.275 --> 00:34:21.407
Uh...

387
00:34:22.712 --> 00:34:24.323
we get along pretty well.

388
00:34:24.323 --> 00:34:26.194
but I don't get to see her much.

389
00:34:26.194 --> 00:34:29.763
She. uh. lives out
on the West Coast.

390
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.115
I have pictures.

391
00:34:35.812 --> 00:34:37.249
Uh...

392
00:34:39.164 --> 00:34:42.123
Monica. That's her partner Lisa.

393
00:34:43.124 --> 00:34:45.170
That's my grandson. Philip.

394
00:34:46.649 --> 00:34:50.218
She and she are together.

395
00:34:50.958 --> 00:34:53.613
You know. together-together?

396
00:34:55.136 --> 00:34:57.399
I don't know if you have that
on your planet.

397
00:34:57.399 --> 00:35:01.186
where two people of the same sex
end up loving each other.

398
00:35:01.186 --> 00:35:04.189
but it's been
happening here a lot

399
00:35:04.189 --> 00:35:06.843
over the last few years.

400
00:35:06.843 --> 00:35:12.327
I let her know from the start
that it didn't make
a hair's difference to me.

401
00:35:13.198 --> 00:35:17.724
And. uh. wouldn't you know.
they spend all their time

402
00:35:17.724 --> 00:35:24.165
sucking up to her mother instead
of coming out here to see me.

403
00:35:29.431 --> 00:35:32.217
I haven't seen them
in person in--

404
00:35:33.609 --> 00:35:34.915
in three years.

405
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:44.272
I swear to God.
I don't normally talk this much!

406
00:35:46.187 --> 00:35:51.061
Milton. do you find yourself
having trouble recollecting
information about yourself

407
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:52.846
that you've known all your life?

408
00:35:52.846 --> 00:35:54.630
Your birthday. your middle name?

409
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:57.807
Do you leave objects in places
where they normally don't go

410
00:35:57.807 --> 00:35:59.548
and not realize until later?

411
00:36:00.506 --> 00:36:01.594
No.

412
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:04.901
- Dad.
- I don't.

413
00:36:05.902 --> 00:36:09.036
He left a can of green beans
in the bathroom cabinet.

414
00:36:09.906 --> 00:36:13.214
That was just once.
I was probably just confused.

415
00:36:15.477 --> 00:36:17.610
I found a newspaper
in the freezer.

416
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.527
That also was just once.

417
00:36:23.093 --> 00:36:28.142
But Dad. that's not the point.
The point is that together.
they're kinda happening often.

418
00:36:28.142 --> 00:36:29.709
He. uh...

419
00:36:32.102 --> 00:36:36.324
he told the cashier at Corrado's
that there was an alien
living in his house.

420
00:36:38.065 --> 00:36:40.676
Milton.
do you remember saying that?

421
00:36:40.676 --> 00:36:42.112
Yeah.

422
00:36:42.112 --> 00:36:43.984
Do you remember
why you said that?

423
00:36:43.984 --> 00:36:45.638
It was a joke.

424
00:36:47.553 --> 00:36:50.033
I don't think it was
a joke when you said it.
I think that you meant it.

425
00:36:50.033 --> 00:36:53.559
I think that he thought
that there was an alien
living in his house.

426
00:36:54.516 --> 00:36:58.303
Milton. this is
a sensitive subject to bring up.

427
00:36:58.303 --> 00:37:02.394
but at your age. and with
these deficits in your thinking.

428
00:37:02.394 --> 00:37:06.267
it may be time to consider
options for assisted living.

429
00:37:06.267 --> 00:37:08.269
such as an in-home caregiver

430
00:37:08.269 --> 00:37:10.402
or moving to
an assisted-living facility.

431
00:37:10.402 --> 00:37:13.840
- Nope.
- Dad. just try to listen
to what she has to say!

432
00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.624
No. I'm sorry. I need to go.

433
00:37:15.624 --> 00:37:18.975
I've got a--
<i>Anderson Cooper</i> is on.

434
00:37:18.975 --> 00:37:21.630
Dad. Wait.

435
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.764
You set me up!
God damn it. you set me up!

436
00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:27.506
I did it because
I'm worried about you.

437
00:37:27.506 --> 00:37:30.726
You brought me here.
had her spring that test on me

438
00:37:30.726 --> 00:37:32.772
without even giving me
a chance to study!

439
00:37:32.772 --> 00:37:35.601
- I'm trying to help.
- I don't need your help!

440
00:37:53.967 --> 00:37:55.664
- Hey. Milt.

441
00:37:55.664 --> 00:37:58.928
I'm just reading him a book
I found in Monica's baby things.

442
00:37:58.928 --> 00:38:00.365
Milty?

443
00:38:01.322 --> 00:38:03.324
- Is everything okay?
-  I'm fine!

444
00:38:03.324 --> 00:38:06.284
-  Are you sure
you're fine?

445
00:38:07.241 --> 00:38:09.896
All right.
I'll talk to you later.

446
00:38:10.853 --> 00:38:12.464
He's had lunch.

447
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:53.853
Denise thinks I'm losing it.
She wants to put me in a home.

448
00:38:55.898 --> 00:39:00.816
I think I called her too many
times to fix the TV system.

449
00:39:10.957 --> 00:39:12.524
I don't talk to my son.

450
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:15.788
He doesn't like me very much.

451
00:39:17.267 --> 00:39:19.748
I understand it.
I wasn't good at...

452
00:39:21.402 --> 00:39:22.838
being a dad.

453
00:39:22.838 --> 00:39:24.013
So I stopped.

454
00:39:25.624 --> 00:39:29.018
No sense keeping going with
something you're not good at.

455
00:39:49.212 --> 00:39:52.215
<i>Hi. this is Tim.
I am unavailable at the moment.</i>

456
00:39:52.215 --> 00:39:54.130
<i>- Please leave a message.</i>

457
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:55.871
Hey. Tim.

458
00:39:55.871 --> 00:39:57.177
It's Dad.

459
00:39:59.092 --> 00:40:00.615
Hope things are good there.

460
00:40:03.183 --> 00:40:05.098
Fall's starting to show up here.

461
00:40:08.449 --> 00:40:10.146
Denise's clinic has moved.

462
00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:13.933
next to that new car wash
out on Lincoln.

463
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.545
Was that here
when you were here?

464
00:40:19.242 --> 00:40:20.461
I don't know.

465
00:40:22.942 --> 00:40:25.205
We'll see how she deals
with the noise.

466
00:40:26.772 --> 00:40:29.078
Maybe the dogs
will get riled up.

467
00:40:35.345 --> 00:40:38.523
I know I wasn't there for you
in ways I should've been.

468
00:40:40.307 --> 00:40:41.787
You deserved better.

469
00:40:45.312 --> 00:40:47.532
But enough's enough.
don't you think?

470
00:40:52.798 --> 00:40:54.800
Looks like I got your machine.

471
00:41:08.378 --> 00:41:10.859
All right.
Arms in the air.

472
00:41:12.034 --> 00:41:15.603
May I?

473
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.789
You can put your arms down now.

474
00:41:37.364 --> 00:41:38.713
It's from back in the day

475
00:41:38.713 --> 00:41:41.629
when she could not
shut up about it.

476
00:41:41.629 --> 00:41:43.370
I thought she was a lesbian.

477
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:44.850
She is.

478
00:41:45.677 --> 00:41:48.636
It's some sort of joke.

479
00:41:48.636 --> 00:41:49.942
Oh.

480
00:41:50.943 --> 00:41:52.553
Well...

481
00:41:52.553 --> 00:41:54.903
at least he's not naked anymore.

482
00:41:55.382 --> 00:41:57.863
I'm not sure myself

483
00:41:57.863 --> 00:41:59.647
that he was.

484
00:42:00.213 --> 00:42:01.257
Oh.

485
00:42:02.868 --> 00:42:06.175
I also thought it might be nice

486
00:42:06.175 --> 00:42:07.916
if we gave him a name.

487
00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:10.658
Do you think that's necessary?
He's just here.

488
00:42:10.658 --> 00:42:12.704
I don't see the need
to call him anything.

489
00:42:12.704 --> 00:42:17.012
Well. for instance.
when we talk about him.

490
00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:21.495
- What do you suggest?
- Well. I had an idea.

491
00:42:21.495 --> 00:42:23.889
And it just feels right.

492
00:42:25.325 --> 00:42:27.327
You think we can call him Jules?

493
00:42:27.327 --> 00:42:29.634
Good as anything else.

494
00:42:29.634 --> 00:42:31.549
But I'm not gonna
call him anything.

495
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:32.985
If he's just here.

496
00:42:32.985 --> 00:42:35.553
then I don't need
to call him anything.

497
00:42:41.123 --> 00:42:44.431
<i>The government continues
to ask the public for help</i>

498
00:42:44.431 --> 00:42:46.259
<i>in its search
for parts of a satellite</i>

499
00:42:46.259 --> 00:42:47.956
<i>they say fell out of the sky</i>

500
00:42:47.956 --> 00:42:50.089
<i>near the Pennsylvania-Ohio

502
00:42:52.874 --> 00:42:56.008
<i>to anyone with information

503
00:43:13.678 --> 00:43:16.594
- Who is it?

504
00:43:22.556 --> 00:43:25.646
-  It's Joyce!
- What do we do?

505
00:43:25.646 --> 00:43:27.866
Take Jules upstairs!

506
00:43:40.487 --> 00:43:42.620
Joyce! How are you?

507
00:43:43.403 --> 00:43:45.971
Uh. Milt and I were
just having a-- a little dinner.

508
00:43:45.971 --> 00:43:50.149
- Would you like to join?
- I seen the alien.

509
00:43:53.065 --> 00:43:56.634
Oh. my goodness.
it's a goddamn extraterrestrial.

510
00:43:58.418 --> 00:44:00.463
I had a feeling
you weren't lying.

511
00:44:00.463 --> 00:44:02.683
I knew you were slipping
but not that fast.

512
00:44:02.683 --> 00:44:04.467
Why were you spying on us?

513
00:44:04.467 --> 00:44:07.383
I thought it was odd the two
of you hanging out together.

514
00:44:07.383 --> 00:44:09.255
You shouldn't have spied on us.

515
00:44:10.735 --> 00:44:13.651
His eyes are so understanding.

516
00:44:16.305 --> 00:44:18.177
- May I touch him?
- Hey!

517
00:44:18.177 --> 00:44:19.961
She shouldn't know!
This is a secret.

518
00:44:19.961 --> 00:44:22.311
- She-- she shouldn't know!
- Guys. calm down.

519
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:24.879
Just. everybody. calm down.
You're scaring Jules.

520
00:44:24.879 --> 00:44:26.533
Jules? He's no Jules.

521
00:44:26.533 --> 00:44:30.580
He's more of a Gary
or-- or a Naomi.

522
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.104
His name is Jules.

523
00:44:32.104 --> 00:44:34.323
and listen. Milton.
she's in on it now. okay?

524
00:44:34.323 --> 00:44:37.326
So we got to trust her.
There's nothing else we can do.

525
00:44:37.326 --> 00:44:38.980
- We could kill her.
- Kill me?

526
00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.808
You can't kill me.
I'll kill you.

527
00:44:40.808 --> 00:44:42.897
- That's what I'll do!
- Guys. stop it!

528
00:44:44.638 --> 00:44:46.422
How do you know
he's not dangerous?

529
00:44:46.422 --> 00:44:48.207
- We know!
- We just know!

530
00:44:48.207 --> 00:44:50.731
Okay. okay.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

531
00:44:51.863 --> 00:44:53.865
But no more
keeping secrets from me.

532
00:44:53.865 --> 00:44:56.128
I'm in on this. like Sandy says.

533
00:44:56.128 --> 00:44:58.957
- We shoulda killed her.
- Milton. hush.

534
00:45:06.616 --> 00:45:09.750
- What's that?
- It's just pictures.

535
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.926
He hands them to me
all the time.

536
00:45:12.753 --> 00:45:14.799
Maybe he's trying
to tell you something.

537
00:45:14.799 --> 00:45:16.888
He's not trying
to tell me something.

538
00:45:17.758 --> 00:45:19.717
This isn't
gonna be fun with her.

539
00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:23.155
Joyce. Jules has come to mean...

540
00:45:24.199 --> 00:45:25.853
quite a bit to us.

541
00:45:25.853 --> 00:45:28.813
And he's gotta be a secret.
You've seen the movies too.

542
00:45:28.813 --> 00:45:30.728
You know
what happens to these guys

543
00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:32.730
when they fall to Earth.

544
00:45:43.262 --> 00:45:45.699
<i>I've tried
getting him back into the house.</i>

545
00:45:45.699 --> 00:45:49.050
<i>but he spends
all day looking at
that spaceship in the backyard.</i>

546
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.878
<i>First thing in the morning.</i>

547
00:45:50.878 --> 00:45:53.185
<i>he's out there
looking at that spaceship.</i>

548
00:46:10.985 --> 00:46:12.334
Yes?

549
00:46:12.334 --> 00:46:14.815
We're from the Department
of National Security.

550
00:46:14.815 --> 00:46:17.296
Do you mind if we have
a look at the premises?

551
00:46:19.124 --> 00:46:21.300
-  Hey. Joyce.
- Gary here?

552
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.259
You mean the alien?
Yeah. Where else would he be?

553
00:46:24.259 --> 00:46:26.305
Come to spend
some time with him.

554
00:46:44.366 --> 00:46:45.541
Hey. Gary.

555
00:46:48.718 --> 00:46:52.374
Joyce. I met you the other day.

556
00:46:54.594 --> 00:46:57.423
Um. I brought you a new shirt.

557
00:46:57.423 --> 00:47:00.034
The one you're wearing
is hardly appropriate.

558
00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:10.566
- Hello?
-  <i>Hi.</i>

559
00:47:10.566 --> 00:47:12.177
<i>I saw your poster at the library</i>

560
00:47:12.177 --> 00:47:14.527
<i>about the senior
mentoring program.</i>

561
00:47:14.527 --> 00:47:16.137
Yes?

562
00:47:16.137 --> 00:47:18.139
<i>Well.
I'm-- I'm not super-young.</i>

563
00:47:18.139 --> 00:47:22.143
<i>but. um-- um. I wouldn't mind
a chat like that.</i>

564
00:47:22.143 --> 00:47:24.667
Oh. fantastic!

565
00:47:24.667 --> 00:47:28.106
And. uh. to whom am I speaking?

566
00:47:29.672 --> 00:47:31.152
Boonton's fine.

567
00:47:32.545 --> 00:47:34.503
But it's not like the Big City.

568
00:47:35.113 --> 00:47:38.290
You might not know it
looking at me the way I am now.

569
00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:39.552
but I was an item.

570
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.035
Away in the Big City.
you can find all the pleasure

571
00:47:44.035 --> 00:47:46.776
and danger you're looking for.

572
00:47:46.776 --> 00:47:49.431
You just have
to exercise self-control.

573
00:47:49.954 --> 00:47:53.261
Otherwise.
the city'll eat you alive.

574
00:47:53.261 --> 00:47:54.436
I was lucky.

575
00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.526
I had my problems.
I mean. my moments.

576
00:47:57.526 --> 00:47:58.658
But. uh...

577
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.357
at least I got out in one piece.

578
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:06.057
No more Pittsburgh for me.

579
00:48:10.539 --> 00:48:12.063
- Danny?
- Yeah.

580
00:48:12.498 --> 00:48:14.674
-  Come on in.
-  Thank you.

581
00:48:17.633 --> 00:48:18.896
Would you like some tea?

582
00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.593
- Sure.
- Great.

583
00:48:20.593 --> 00:48:22.595
So how old are you. Danny?

584
00:48:22.595 --> 00:48:25.380
- 27.
- I'm 72.

585
00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.339
- Ah.

586
00:48:27.339 --> 00:48:30.342
Some people. they get real
sensitive about their age.

587
00:48:30.342 --> 00:48:32.997
Do everything they can
to look younger.

588
00:48:32.997 --> 00:48:36.870
But that's one thing
I wanted to tell you. Danny.

589
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:39.655
Aging is natural.

590
00:48:40.743 --> 00:48:42.876
Physical beauty
is here for a moment.

591
00:48:42.876 --> 00:48:45.618
and then it is gone.

592
00:48:47.185 --> 00:48:49.752
I really blossomed
in the Big City.

593
00:48:49.752 --> 00:48:51.319
Came into my own.

594
00:48:51.319 --> 00:48:54.540
Joyce. I think
he wants to fix his spaceship.

595
00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.498
I had my share of lovers.

596
00:48:58.283 --> 00:49:00.285
Never really
settled down with one.

597
00:49:01.503 --> 00:49:02.591
For a while. I...

598
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:05.072
I sang.

599
00:49:05.899 --> 00:49:08.293
Can you believe it?
I was a singer.

600
00:49:09.859 --> 00:49:11.470
You bet I can sing.

601
00:49:13.037 --> 00:49:15.126
And I've still got it too.

602
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:17.911
Does this thing have Bluetooth?

603
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:20.305
Do you mind
if I use the bathroom?

604
00:49:20.305 --> 00:49:21.959
Uh. of course.

605
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:23.786
Top of the stairs
and on your left.

606
00:49:23.786 --> 00:49:24.918
- Up there?
- Yeah.

607
00:49:24.918 --> 00:49:26.398
Okay.

608
00:49:34.449 --> 00:49:39.977

You don't have to do that.

615
00:50:07.874 --> 00:50:09.484
Why don't you
come back downstairs.

616
00:50:09.484 --> 00:50:12.357
and we'll talk
some more about life.

617
00:50:12.357 --> 00:50:15.534
I think I'd rather
just take some of your jewelry.

618
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:18.363

00:51:30.957 --> 00:51:32.524
That's right.

628
00:51:32.524 --> 00:51:33.829
Out of nowhere?

629
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:36.136
Out of nowhere.

630
00:51:41.098 --> 00:51:43.230
Heads don't tend to just...

631
00:51:44.797 --> 00:51:46.320
explode like that.

632
00:51:47.539 --> 00:51:50.063
Are you suggesting
I made a man's head

633
00:51:50.063 --> 00:51:52.283
explode off his shoulders?

634
00:51:52.283 --> 00:51:55.024
And how exactly would I do that?

635
00:51:55.024 --> 00:51:56.635
You tell us.

636
00:51:56.635 --> 00:51:58.941
How would something
that extraordinary

637
00:51:58.941 --> 00:52:00.247
happen in your house?

638
00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.320
Oh. it's Sandy.

639
00:52:30.538 --> 00:52:31.844
Where is he?

640
00:52:31.844 --> 00:52:33.715
In the back.
working on his ship.

641
00:53:09.055 --> 00:53:10.491
I knew he had powers.

642
00:53:10.491 --> 00:53:12.711
These guys usually have powers.

643
00:53:13.538 --> 00:53:15.322
Does this mean he's dangerous?

644
00:53:15.322 --> 00:53:18.630
Well. only when someone's
being dangerous towards us.

645
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:20.240
Right.

646
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.547
Only when someone's
being dangerous towards us.

647
00:53:22.547 --> 00:53:26.638
- That's true.
- I mean. he saved me.

648
00:53:26.638 --> 00:53:28.814
Can you imagine
what would've happened

649
00:53:28.814 --> 00:53:30.294
if he didn't get involved?

650
00:53:31.164 --> 00:53:32.687
I wouldn't be here.

651
00:53:33.949 --> 00:53:35.473
Well. is it possible

652
00:53:35.473 --> 00:53:37.779
he could do it
to someone who wasn't bad?

653
00:53:37.779 --> 00:53:39.694
What? He hasn't done it yet.

654
00:53:39.694 --> 00:53:42.262
I don't see
why we should prejudice him

655
00:53:42.262 --> 00:53:43.524
with our fearful thoughts.

656
00:53:43.524 --> 00:53:45.309
All right. Just asking.

657
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:46.875
As far as I'm concerned.

658
00:53:46.875 --> 00:53:49.617
Jules is on our side.
and we oughta be on his.

659
00:53:49.617 --> 00:53:51.924
-  I agree.
-  I agree too.

660
00:54:57.903 --> 00:55:00.035
There was no weapon
found at the scene?

661
00:55:00.035 --> 00:55:01.994
- No explosive material?
- Nothing.

662
00:55:02.516 --> 00:55:04.823
Heads do not
just blow off people's bodies.

663
00:55:04.823 --> 00:55:06.390
No. they do not.

664
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:09.001
- Forensics has no explanation?
- Not a one.

665
00:55:10.524 --> 00:55:12.265
Maybe Sandy's
protecting someone.

666
00:55:12.265 --> 00:55:13.527
She has a big heart.

667
00:55:13.527 --> 00:55:15.181
Let's put a tail on her.

668
00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:17.139
See if she gets up
to anything unusual.

669
00:55:17.139 --> 00:55:18.489
Yes. sir.

670
00:55:20.273 --> 00:55:23.232
Dad. Dad.

671
00:55:23.232 --> 00:55:24.451
Oh. Dad. come--

672
00:55:24.451 --> 00:55:26.845
hey. come on. just a minute.

673
00:55:29.369 --> 00:55:31.850
Since when have you been
hanging out with Sandy?

674
00:55:32.459 --> 00:55:34.635
- Okay.
- Okay. just-- okay. wait.

675
00:55:34.635 --> 00:55:37.856
I am sorry for surprising you
the other day.

676
00:55:37.856 --> 00:55:39.510
I'm worried. okay?

677
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:41.773
What you have said
has not been normal.

678
00:55:41.773 --> 00:55:44.166
And I know that you value
your independence.

679
00:55:44.166 --> 00:55:47.300
But there comes a time.

680
00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.520
Denise.
I swear to you. I'm okay.

681
00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.956
How can you say that

682
00:55:50.956 --> 00:55:52.958
when you're buying apples
for an alien?

683
00:55:52.958 --> 00:55:55.482
The apples aren't for an alien.
They're for me.

684
00:55:55.482 --> 00:55:57.963
- 20 of them?
- Can't talk right now.

685
00:56:00.705 --> 00:56:02.446
Good to see you.
Try not to worry.

686
00:56:02.446 --> 00:56:03.751
Well. that's impossible!

687
00:56:03.751 --> 00:56:06.058
- Dad!

688
00:56:24.163 --> 00:56:25.817
So I said to the doctor.

689
00:56:25.817 --> 00:56:29.821
I think this medicine
is giving me sexual feelings.

690
00:56:29.821 --> 00:56:31.213
What did he say?

691
00:56:31.213 --> 00:56:33.041
He went and researched it.

692
00:56:33.041 --> 00:56:35.392
and he said. "You're darn right.

693
00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:37.437
It's one of the side effects.

694
00:56:37.437 --> 00:56:41.136
It's a rare one.
but it's one of 'em."

695
00:56:41.963 --> 00:56:45.184
He switched me
to another medication.

696
00:56:45.184 --> 00:56:47.186
Do you have any
of the old pills left?

697
00:56:47.186 --> 00:56:50.929
Milton!

698
00:56:57.501 --> 00:56:59.851
Do you guys smell that?

699
00:56:59.851 --> 00:57:00.939
What?

700
00:57:01.679 --> 00:57:03.811
It's kind of a rotting smell.

701
00:57:03.811 --> 00:57:05.726
I-- I didn't want
to say anything

702
00:57:05.726 --> 00:57:08.816
because I thought that's the way
your house usually smelled.

703
00:57:11.776 --> 00:57:12.864
Oh. my.

704
00:57:14.518 --> 00:57:15.997
It's a cat.

705
00:57:16.824 --> 00:57:19.479
He killed a cat
and brought it here?

706
00:57:19.479 --> 00:57:21.481
That's a tire mark.

707
00:57:21.481 --> 00:57:24.963
Unless he stole a car.
he didn't kill this animal.

708
00:57:24.963 --> 00:57:27.966
He-- he found it.

709
00:57:30.185 --> 00:57:31.970
He needs cats.

710
00:57:34.015 --> 00:57:35.974
I told you
he was sending us a message.

711
00:57:35.974 --> 00:57:38.455
You guys should listen
to me more often.

712
00:57:41.501 --> 00:57:42.850
Let me see that.

713
00:57:44.243 --> 00:57:45.984
That's his spaceship.

714
00:57:48.813 --> 00:57:51.946
I think he needs six more cats

715
00:57:51.946 --> 00:57:54.296
to get his ship working!

716
00:57:54.296 --> 00:57:56.429
Before. he needed seven.

717
00:57:56.429 --> 00:57:59.606
But with that one.
he needs six more.

718
00:57:59.606 --> 00:58:01.608
Oh. I'm telling you.
I get this guy.

719
00:58:01.608 --> 00:58:03.436
I get this guy more than you do.

720
00:58:03.436 --> 00:58:06.308
I think she might be right.

721
00:58:06.308 --> 00:58:08.310
Seven cats?

722
00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:10.487
What makes his ship run
is seven cats?

723
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:14.665
Well. the only thing
he eats is apples.

724
00:58:14.665 --> 00:58:18.016
You got to kinda take him
on his own terms. you know?

725
00:58:18.756 --> 00:58:20.584
So what are we supposed to do?

726
00:58:20.584 --> 00:58:23.282
- Kill six cats?

727
00:58:23.282 --> 00:58:26.677
<i>Green Turtle Veterinary Clinic.
How can I help you?</i>

728
00:58:26.677 --> 00:58:29.027
Is Dr. Robinson there?
This is her father.

729
00:58:29.027 --> 00:58:30.681
<i>Just one moment.</i>

730
00:58:32.987 --> 00:58:36.556
- Hey. Dad. what's up?
<i>- Oh. not much.</i>

731
00:58:36.556 --> 00:58:38.819
Um. how are you doing?

732
00:58:38.819 --> 00:58:40.168
<i>I'm fine.</i>

733
00:58:42.475 --> 00:58:45.130
What happens to the cats
that die in your office?

734
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:46.827
What?

735
00:58:47.611 --> 00:58:50.178
<i>What happens to the cats
that die in your office?</i>

736
00:58:51.745 --> 00:58:54.008
Why are you asking me that?

737
00:58:54.008 --> 00:58:57.446
Oh. j-- just trying
to make conversation.

738
00:58:57.446 --> 00:58:59.884
Dad. what is going on?

739
00:58:59.884 --> 00:59:01.538
Nothing.

740
00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:03.975
Then. why are you
asking me that?

741
00:59:04.584 --> 00:59:06.238
Do they--
do they incinerate them.

742
00:59:06.238 --> 00:59:09.371
or-- or do they just throw them
in the dumpster out back?

743
00:59:09.371 --> 00:59:10.938
Well. I'm not saying
another word

744
00:59:10.938 --> 00:59:13.637
until you tell me
why you're asking.

745
00:59:13.637 --> 00:59:15.334
<i>Do you even know
why you're asking?</i>

746
00:59:15.334 --> 00:59:18.337
<i>- And you wonder why I'm
worried.</i>
- You know what?

747
00:59:18.337 --> 00:59:20.382
- Forget it.
<i>- Forget it?</i>

748
00:59:20.382 --> 00:59:22.254
How am I supposed to forget it?

749
00:59:22.254 --> 00:59:23.777
I was just curious. that was it.

750
00:59:23.777 --> 00:59:26.084
<i>And you don't even have a cat.</i>

751
00:59:26.084 --> 00:59:28.216
I've got to go. Love you.

752
00:59:30.915 --> 00:59:33.091
She didn't give me
a straight answer.

753
00:59:58.290 --> 00:59:59.378
Slow down.

754
01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:05.079
Raccoon.

755
01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.006
Possum.

756
01:00:20.486 --> 01:00:23.358
Car is going
extremely slow out on 22.

757
01:00:23.358 --> 01:00:26.753
Makes following them undetected
almost impossible.

758
01:00:26.753 --> 01:00:29.016
<i>Any idea what they're doing?</i>

759
01:00:29.016 --> 01:00:31.323
Seems like
they're looking for something.

760
01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:38.025
Sandy.

761
01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:41.768
- How'd it start?
- What?

762
01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.120
With Earl.

763
01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.818
How'd it start?

764
01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:55.347
He was generally
forgetful at first.

765
01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:01.179
Not as quick...

766
01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:04.225
as he used to be.

767
01:01:06.793 --> 01:01:09.361
He s-- started leaving things

768
01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:12.190
in-- in weird places.

769
01:01:14.192 --> 01:01:16.673
I found the silverware
in the bedroom.

770
01:01:18.892 --> 01:01:23.027
One time.
he-- he pooped in the bidet.

771
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:29.207
He was very embarrassed
about that.

772
01:01:32.863 --> 01:01:34.212
Why?

773
01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:37.694
Did the doctor say
something that worried you?

774
01:01:41.828 --> 01:01:44.178
Do you forget things sometimes?

775
01:01:48.443 --> 01:01:49.706
Milton?

776
01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:54.449
I don't mean to.

777
01:01:59.498 --> 01:02:01.195
I don't want to worry you.

778
01:02:02.414 --> 01:02:05.330
Milton. it-- it was years

779
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:07.158
before it got bad.

780
01:02:08.463 --> 01:02:10.117
Don't go down that rabbit hole.

781
01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:15.514
You gotta enjoy life.
not worry it away.

782
01:02:15.514 --> 01:02:16.820
- Stop.
- All right.

783
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.386
I won't say another thing.

784
01:02:18.386 --> 01:02:20.519
No. no. no. no. I mean s-- stop.

785
01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:48.068
The fuck?

786
01:02:57.730 --> 01:03:00.254
-  How many did you get?
- We got two.

787
01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.735
Well. one and three quarters.

788
01:03:02.735 --> 01:03:05.216
Not easy. what's out there
is mostly possums.

789
01:03:06.478 --> 01:03:10.787
We need four more.

790
01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.440
Well. three and a--

791
01:03:13.528 --> 01:03:14.965
four and--

792
01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:18.490
aw. heck.
I was never good at fractions.

793
01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:20.013
I'll find 'em.

794
01:03:20.013 --> 01:03:21.710
How will you find 'em?

795
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:24.452
I don't care if I have to scour

796
01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:26.193
the streets of this town.

797
01:03:26.193 --> 01:03:27.629
I'll find 'em.

798
01:03:27.629 --> 01:03:29.980
-  <i>How are you?</i>
-  <i>I'm good.</i>

799
01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:32.243
<i>- What's up?</i>
-  <i>It's about Dad.</i>

800
01:03:32.243 --> 01:03:36.116
<i>He's not doing well.
He's acting strange lately.</i>

801
01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:38.989
<i>Well. he's been acting
strange for years.</i>

802
01:03:38.989 --> 01:03:41.643
<i>He told
the check-out guy at Corrado's</i>

803
01:03:41.643 --> 01:03:43.080
<i>that he was buying apples</i>

804
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.734
<i>for an alien
living in his house.</i>

805
01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:48.128
<i>Well.
was it an illegal alien?</i>

806
01:03:48.128 --> 01:03:50.435
<i>No. it was an alien
from outer space.</i>

807
01:03:50.435 --> 01:03:52.741
<i>- He was very clear on that.</i>

808
01:03:59.444 --> 01:04:00.532
I got three.

809
01:04:00.532 --> 01:04:03.491
Well. three and a third. really.

810
01:04:03.491 --> 01:04:06.320
And that more than makes up

811
01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.322
for the missing quarter.

812
01:04:11.978 --> 01:04:15.199
I've always been
very decent with fractions.

813
01:04:17.201 --> 01:04:18.855
We still need one more.

814
01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:40.485
Those look like agents.

815
01:04:40.485 --> 01:04:43.009
L-- like government agents?

816
01:04:43.009 --> 01:04:44.750
Like the ones in the movies.

817
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.491
I'll take Jules upstairs.

818
01:04:49.407 --> 01:04:50.538
Where is he?

819
01:05:01.593 --> 01:05:04.422
<i>Unit 4.
return to operations.</i>

820
01:05:04.813 --> 01:05:06.337
Come on. Let's go.

821
01:05:26.661 --> 01:05:28.011
Okay.

822
01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:29.534
We've gotta act quickly.

823
01:05:29.534 --> 01:05:30.927
'cause any moment we waste

824
01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.667
is a moment
they can discover him.

825
01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:35.714
- We can both go out driving.
- That'll take too long.

826
01:05:35.714 --> 01:05:37.237
And besides.
I looked everywhere.

827
01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:38.891
Well. short of killing a cat.

828
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:40.719
I don't know
how we're gonna do it.

829
01:05:40.719 --> 01:05:42.068
Well. what about yours?

830
01:05:44.766 --> 01:05:46.029
Henry?

831
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:47.726
The hell you talking about?

832
01:05:47.726 --> 01:05:51.556
You said he doesn't hear.
he doesn't see. he can't walk.

833
01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:53.079
He's pretty much dead.

834
01:05:56.604 --> 01:05:58.519
Well. he's not dead.

835
01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:04.090
He's like my child.

836
01:06:06.223 --> 01:06:08.355
You can go fuck yourself!

837
01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:39.952
I'm sorry
about what Milton said.

838
01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:41.432
He spoke out of turn.

839
01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:48.134
Henry's been there
every time I've come home.

840
01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:51.094
No one else has.

841
01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:53.618
Of course.

842
01:06:53.618 --> 01:06:55.054
Pets may just be pets.

843
01:06:55.054 --> 01:06:58.449
but they're part of the family.

844
01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:03.323
I watched him get worse.

845
01:07:03.323 --> 01:07:05.543
and I just
didn't do anything about it.

846
01:07:07.371 --> 01:07:10.026
I was too afraid
of what it would be like

847
01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:11.288
without him.

848
01:07:14.117 --> 01:07:15.727
He's all I have.

849
01:07:20.732 --> 01:07:22.168
Do you know it's been a year

850
01:07:22.168 --> 01:07:24.736
since he was able to
walk up to me on his own?

851
01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:30.350
Milton's right.

852
01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:33.571
He's not all I have.

853
01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:37.140
He's all I had.

854
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.805
All right. go ahead.

855
01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:52.372
Let's do this.

856
01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.332
Explode his head.

857
01:07:55.332 --> 01:07:56.420
Wait.

858
01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:02.426
Better to cut down on the mess.

859
01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:08.171
Goodbye. sweet pea.

860
01:10:51.464 --> 01:10:53.118
<i>Go back to 870 Elmore!</i>

861
01:10:53.118 --> 01:10:54.641
<i>- Go back!</i>
- Yes.

862
01:11:25.063 --> 01:11:26.934
Congratulations.

863
01:11:26.934 --> 01:11:28.936
Jules. I'm--

864
01:11:28.936 --> 01:11:30.982
I'm so happy for you.

865
01:11:36.161 --> 01:11:37.554
I brought you something.

866
01:11:37.554 --> 01:11:39.904
It's a snow globe of the city.

867
01:11:39.904 --> 01:11:44.430
It's a typical gift that you get
when you're in some place new.

868
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:47.085
It's. uh--
it kind of means a lot to me.

869
01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:48.869
reminds me
of my time in the city.

870
01:11:50.393 --> 01:11:51.742
I want you to have it.

871
01:11:54.658 --> 01:11:58.357
I. uh--
I brought you something too.

872
01:11:58.357 --> 01:12:02.579
I don't know if it gets cold
where you're from.

873
01:12:02.579 --> 01:12:06.322
but you maybe.
you can get some use out of it.

874
01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:09.760
Oh. not now.

875
01:12:11.239 --> 01:12:12.502
Later.

876
01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.376
I didn't know
we were giving gifts.

877
01:12:20.205 --> 01:12:22.555
So you don't forget
what I look like.

878
01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:35.176
What was that?

879
01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:36.917
Did he just
do something?

880
01:12:44.403 --> 01:12:46.100
I think he's inviting us.

881
01:13:03.161 --> 01:13:04.380
I'll go.

882
01:13:13.911 --> 01:13:15.173
I'd like to go with you.

883
01:13:15.913 --> 01:13:18.872
Milton. You can't.
You've got Denise.

884
01:13:18.872 --> 01:13:20.091
I'm ready to go.

885
01:13:22.702 --> 01:13:24.661
Jules has been
nice company to me here.

886
01:13:24.661 --> 01:13:27.707
and I prefer
not to have Denise see me

887
01:13:27.707 --> 01:13:29.579
get worse and worse every year.

888
01:13:44.463 --> 01:13:45.421
Hello?

889
01:13:47.205 --> 01:13:50.251
<i>Dad.
I'm not calling about the alien.</i>

890
01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:52.123
<i>I'm not calling
about any of that.</i>

891
01:13:53.777 --> 01:13:55.518
<i>It's time for your hair cut.</i>

892
01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:57.607
<i>So I could. uh--
I could come by Saturday.</i>

893
01:13:57.607 --> 01:14:00.566
<i>and we could have lunch.
and I could take care of it.</i>

894
01:14:04.657 --> 01:14:07.051
We've been fighting.
and I just want to hang out.

895
01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:11.577
<i>Will you be around Saturday?</i>

896
01:14:13.666 --> 01:14:15.712
Don't you work Saturdays?

897
01:14:16.321 --> 01:14:18.584
<i>I'll get Heather
to cover for me.</i>

898
01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:20.717
<i>Will you be around?</i>

899
01:14:23.502 --> 01:14:24.721
<i>Dad?</i>

900
01:14:25.548 --> 01:14:28.812
<i>I've seen you shut down before.</i>

901
01:14:31.292 --> 01:14:33.164
<i>I don't want that
to happen to us.</i>

902
01:14:36.776 --> 01:14:38.822
I'll have to check my schedule.

903
01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:44.001
Is everything okay?

904
01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:49.006
Yes. it is.

905
01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:50.964
<i>All right.</i>

906
01:14:52.009 --> 01:14:53.097
<i>I'll wait to hear.</i>

907
01:14:54.533 --> 01:14:55.795
I love you. Dad.

908
01:14:57.275 --> 01:14:58.494
You too.

909
01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:00.539
Bye.

910
01:15:16.773 --> 01:15:19.036
National Security!
Open the door!

911
01:15:19.776 --> 01:15:21.299
They're coming for Jules!

912
01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:24.041
They're coming!

913
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.912
Get him in the ship!

914
01:16:01.513 --> 01:16:03.428
Whoa. Whoa.

915
01:16:03.428 --> 01:16:06.213
That was amazing.

916
01:16:06.213 --> 01:16:08.259
Are we on his planet already?

917
01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.654
That didn't feel like very long.

918
01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:13.656
Felt
like just a few seconds.

919
01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:17.660
I've got four bars
and a text message.

920
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:20.880
I think we're still on Earth.

921
01:16:21.794 --> 01:16:24.275
I think he just stopped to--

922
01:16:25.406 --> 01:16:26.756
to drop us off.

923
01:16:27.495 --> 01:16:29.106
I think we're still on Earth.

924
01:16:35.329 --> 01:16:36.592
Well. Jules.

925
01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:40.291
I guess it's time
for your intergalactic journey.

926
01:16:43.294 --> 01:16:46.253
If they didn't need me
to keep this town on the rails.

927
01:16:46.253 --> 01:16:47.777
I'd come with you.

928
01:17:01.268 --> 01:17:02.792
And Milton?

929
01:17:10.974 --> 01:17:14.107
I'm so thankful
for your invitation to join you.

930
01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:17.502
And I know
I would have enjoyed very much

931
01:17:17.502 --> 01:17:19.591
journeying with you
through the heavens.

932
01:17:19.591 --> 01:17:20.940
and seeing your home.

933
01:17:24.248 --> 01:17:26.990
But I've lived
on this planet all my life.

934
01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:29.645
It's my home.

935
01:17:31.516 --> 01:17:32.952
Doesn't stop being that

936
01:17:32.952 --> 01:17:35.215
just 'cause
I'm getting ready to leave it.

937
01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:39.698
What's coming
probably won't be fun.

938
01:17:41.744 --> 01:17:43.180
But I ought to do it here.

939
01:17:58.325 --> 01:17:59.936
I'll be okay.

940
01:19:45.084 --> 01:19:46.912
Do you think he remembers us?

941
01:19:49.219 --> 01:19:50.394
Who?

942
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.092
Gary.

943
01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:55.834
Of course he remembers us.

944
01:19:55.834 --> 01:19:58.315
Don't you think
he's been to other planets?

945
01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:01.579
Don't you think
he's met other life forms?

946
01:20:01.579 --> 01:20:04.234
He remembers us.

947
01:20:05.278 --> 01:20:07.106
I am sure of it.

948
01:20:11.676 --> 01:20:13.634
Do you think Gary
remembers us. Milton?

949
01:20:13.634 --> 01:20:15.811
Gary? Who's Gary?

950
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:17.073
Jules.
