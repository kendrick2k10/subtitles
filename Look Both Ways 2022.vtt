-Are you ready?
-No.

4
00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:17.291
-Are you ready?
-No.

5
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:20.500
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

6
00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:24.250
Okay. the Swiss astronomer
who discovered dark matter was…

7
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.333
-Ferrero Rocher?

8
00:00:26.416 --> 00:00:27.416
No…

9
00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:28.791
No.

10
00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.916
This is impossible. Uh…

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.708
You said that this was gonna be
the easiest class. and it's not.

12
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:36.708
The only reason you took this class

13
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:38.833
is because that really hot girl
was gonna take it.

14
00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:41.250
You know what? Forget finals.

15
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.041
I am a drummer in a band.
and you are a brilliant artist.

16
00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:45.625
Look at this.

17
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:48.583
You've got a great future
ahead of you. Nat.

18
00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:52.500
Not yet. which is why
I need to graduate with honors…

19
00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:54.958
-Mm-hmm.
-…so I can get my job in LA…

20
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.916
-Mm-hmm.
-…and impress the shit out of my bosses

21
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.833
so I can make my own movies.
that's what I want.

22
00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:00.041
You're gonna do it.

23
00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:01.625
-Yeah.
-'Cause of the five-year plan.

24
00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:04.125
-If you fail to plan. you plan to fail.
-Plan to fail.

25
00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:06.041
-Exactly correct.
-Live. love. laugh.

26
00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:08.625
-"Live. laugh. love." We've talked about--
-Live. laugh. love.

27
00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:10.666
Gabe. this is important.

28
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.583
What we're doing right now
is setting us up for our future.

29
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.750
Okay. fine.

30
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:19.250
But you got the future covered.
so I got the present. Let's go.

31
00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:31.208
-A toast.
-A toast? To what?

32
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.958
Drink first. then I'll tell you.

33
00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:40.125
My band
finally got sponsored for our tour.

34
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.583
Your band got sponsored for your--

35
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.500
-Oh my God! Shit. Sorry.
-Shh!

36
00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:45.875
-Yeah.

37
00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.791
See? That's why I'm saying. like.
Nat. we're graduating.

38
00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:52.541
And you're gonna pass. and I'm gonna pass.

39
00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:56.083
and you don't realize that your--
your five-year plan is already in motion.

40
00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.000
Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:59.791
But we only have this moment once.

42
00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:04.583
The present moment.

43
00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:08.208
-The present moment?
-Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.833
So what do you suggest we do
to harness this present moment?

45
00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.250
This is crazy.

46
00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:25.583
It's batshit.

47
00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:30.958
We're just friends.

48
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:32.666
-Good friends.
-Yeah.

49
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.625
Very good friends.

50
00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:36.791
And we're so different.

51
00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:39.750
I mean.
we couldn't be more opposite.

52
00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:44.416
I mean. we're not even
attracted to each other. really.

53
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.458
Oh.

54
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:47.541
that's not true.

55
00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:50.083
Gabe?

56
00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:51.041
Nat?

57
00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.541
-Just promise me…
-What?

58
00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:56.791
Promise me this doesn't
have to be a big deal.

59

-I know.
-It shouldn't happen to us.

142
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.541
-This happens to other people.
-I know.

143
00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:48.583
We shouldn't be in this situation.
Damn it.

144
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.833
Hmm.

-I'm sorry.
-No.

147
00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:04.541

I'm trying to wrap my head around it.

148
00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.000
-I don't know.
-Me too.

149
00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:08.041

It is… It is your choice.

153
00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:33.541
Hmm?

154
00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:39.041
I don't mean that as a cop-out
because. obviously. it affects me.

155
00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:42.791
And I support you
with whatever you choose.

156
00:09:46.083 --> 00:09:47.458

-Thank you.
-I mean it.

158
00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:55.125
-I mean it.
-I know.

159
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.208
I think I'm gonna have this baby.

160
00:10:20.458 --> 00:10:21.416
Okay.

161
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.041
So you and Gabe…

162
00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:29.416
He was really…

163
00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.083
supportive and-- and

164
00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:37.041
understanding.

165
00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:39.500
-Mm-hmm.
-We're obviously not gonna be a couple.

166
00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:44.125
but he wants to help.
and I could really use that right now.

167
00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:46.083
Just for a while.

168
00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:52.750
I don't know how to explain it.

169
00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:55.250
It's just. it feels like
this is something…

170
00:10:57.083 --> 00:10:59.166
…that I have to do.

171
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.166
Like this is what was supposed to happen.

172
00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:10.208
-So. obviously. I can't go to LA.
-Oh…

173
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:11.791
I mean. it's okay.

174
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:13.583
I'm…

175
00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:16.875
-I'm not gonna go either. obviously.
-No. You're going to LA.

176
00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.125
-You're going to LA.
-I-- I can't leave you here.

177
00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:21.291
-Yes. You can go to--
-I can't go to LA by myself.

Yes. you can.
If anyone can do it. it's you.

179
00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:29.125
-Nat.
-You worked

180
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.833
so hard for this.

181
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.625
And you have
that advertising job lined up. Remember?

182
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:45.166
So you're gonna go.

183
00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:48.291
And don't worry about me.

184
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:52.083
I can still draw. one way or another.
I'll figure it out.

185
00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:55.041
Okay?

186
00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:58.625
Okay.

187
00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.208
I'm going to miss you!

188
00:12:17.125 --> 00:12:18.916
-Hey!
-I guess the next time I'll see you

189
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.916
is when
you're playing at the Hollywood Bowl.

190
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.666
Oh! Or worst case. the Wiltern.

191
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.166
-Yeah. worst case.

192
00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958
-Thank you for helping me.
-Yes.

193
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.375
Okay. call me as soon as you…

194
00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:35.708
-I'll miss you.
-I'm gonna miss you too. Gabe.

195
00:12:36.416 --> 00:12:37.666
-Okay.

196
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.541
-I'm gonna visit.
-Yeah. I know that.

197
00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:40.958
Use your blinkers.

198
00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:42.791
-Watch out when you merge.
-I will.

199
00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:46.458
Cara!

200
00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:47.791
See you.

201
00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:50.625
Oh. hey!

202
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.791
Bye.

203
00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:55.708
Bye.

204
00:12:59.666 --> 00:13:00.666
Okay.

205
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.958
Buckle up. bitch.

206
00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:12.250
-Later!

207
00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:47.625
Oh yeah.

208
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.000
-Is that Nat?
-Huh?

209
00:13:50.083 --> 00:13:53.333
Let's just ease into it.
I'll find the right time to tell them.

210
00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:54.916
-Yeah.
-Is that okay?

211
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.041
-Mm-hmm. Sounds good.
-Cool.

212
00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:58.625
Hi! Honey. what are you doing here?

213
00:13:58.708 --> 00:14:00.375
-I thought you were on your way to LA.
-Hey!

214
00:14:00.458 --> 00:14:01.333
Hi. Gabe!

215
00:14:01.416 --> 00:14:02.833
-It's great to see ya.
-I'm pregnant.

216
00:14:03.416 --> 00:14:04.250
What?

217
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.750
Him?

218
00:14:12.708 --> 00:14:15.375
Can we… talk about it?

219
00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:21.291
I didn't-- I didn't even know
that you guys were a thing.

220
00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:22.416
We're not.

221
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.333
Oh. great!

222
00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:26.166
Yeah. no. we're just friends. mostly.

223
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.083
-Uh-huh.
-Um…

224
00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:29.041
Every day. except one day. Uh…

225
00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:31.375
It was a night. really.
Just-- It was half a night.

226
00:14:31.458 --> 00:14:32.708
-Good Lord!
-Stop. Gabe!

227
00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:33.750
Wow!

228
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:36.333
I'm still trying to figure this out.

229
00:14:36.416 --> 00:14:38.916
I'm trying to make
the best decision here.

230
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.958
-Right.
-Moving forward.

231
00:14:40.041 --> 00:14:41.916
I-- I know you guys are very happy

232
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.250
-with your empty nest that you've had…
-It's been great.

233
00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:46.625
…and you've been enjoying that.

234
00:14:47.208 --> 00:14:49.458
But could I possibly

235
00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:51.166
come home?

236
00:14:52.375 --> 00:14:53.291
Hmm.

237
00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.208
What about your goals?
What about moving to LA?

238
00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:58.875
-What about--
-You just got your degree. Nattie.

239
00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.833
That's everything you'd worked towards
since you were a little girl.

240
00:15:01.916 --> 00:15:05.500
-Everything you dreamed about.
-I'm still gonna work in animation. Dad.

241
00:15:05.583 --> 00:15:07.750
-Some-- Someh--Ye-- I am!
-I mean--

242
00:15:07.833 --> 00:15:10.500
It's just being put on pause
for a-- a minute.

243
00:15:10.583 --> 00:15:11.583
Wha…

244
00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:14.166
What-- what did you study again. Gabe?

245
00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.416
-History.
-History?

246
00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.333
Oh!

247
00:15:18.416 --> 00:15:21.083
Yeah. I'm still obviously trying
to figure out what to do with that.

248
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.583
Stop. Gabe.

249
00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:29.583
But. um. I'm planning to work as a… uh…

250
00:15:29.666 --> 00:15:33.708
Keep my job in dry cleaning. and. um…
throughout the summer. between gigs.

251
00:15:33.791 --> 00:15:36.875
-Gigs?
-I'm also a… a drummer in a band.

252
00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.000
Drummers…

253
00:15:38.083 --> 00:15:39.541
So. a musician.

254
00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:40.750
Does that pay?

255
00:15:44.583 --> 00:15:45.708
Uh…

256
00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:46.875
Not yet.

257
00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.666
Then you're not a musician.
You're a dry cleaner.

258
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.041
And now you got us on spin cycle.
don't you. pal?

259
00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:56.833
No. you can't do that. You can't tell him
to give up on his dream.

260
00:15:56.916 --> 00:15:58.875
-You've gotta give up yours. Why can't…
-I'm not--

261
00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.458
-I'm not giving up my dream!
-With all due respect. Ms. Bennett--

262
00:16:01.541 --> 00:16:03.875
-No. I'm not!
-…I'm gonna be doing my share.

263
00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.250
Your share?
I think you've already done your share!

264
00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:09.833
-You can't have this judgmental attitude.
-Your share has been accomplished!

265
00:16:09.916 --> 00:16:12.416
-We're trying to come to you…
-You think we're gonna be like…

266
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.833
-What conversation did you think--
-Hold on. Tina. just…

267
00:16:14.916 --> 00:16:18.583
Guys. just hold on. We've all got
a lot of feelings right now. okay?

268
00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:22.875
Your mother and I. in particular.
towards this… young gentleman…

269
00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.458
-And you.
-I know.

270
00:16:24.541 --> 00:16:27.708
I think the best thing
that can be done at this moment

271
00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:30.833
is for you and I
to take a few deep breaths.

272
00:16:30.916 --> 00:16:32.416
We're gonna take a moment.

273
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.541
-Step outside onto the porch.
-Seriously?

274
00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:36.041
-Yeah. I'm serious. Come on.
-Okay.

275
00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:37.875
-Wow.
-I think it's the best thing to do.

276
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.541
Did we not teach her about safe sex?

277
00:16:46.625 --> 00:16:48.458
-Not show her how to put on a condom?
-We did.

278
00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:51.500
We did. We taught her about condoms.
I remember the conversation.

279
00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:53.625
She was 15. I was sweating.

280
00:16:53.708 --> 00:16:56.083
They were just not expecting it
to play out that way.

281
00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:57.250
They weren't ex--

282
00:16:57.333 --> 00:17:00.041
-I wasn't expecting… this.
-…to do?

283
00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:03.250
-I did not see…
-Why are you okay with this?

284
00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:07.375
-…"single. unemployed. 22-year-old mom"…
-Why are you not freaking out?

285
00:17:07.458 --> 00:17:10.916
…on my tarot card reading
that Cara gave me last month.

286
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.708
What about our plans?

287
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:15.166
What about naked Sundays?

288
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.875
-And furniture with sharp edges?

289
00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.791
-We were going to Barcelona next year.
-Hey--

290
00:17:19.875 --> 00:17:22.250
I've been thinking
about that quite a bit.

291
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.291
It would make sense if…

292
00:17:25.833 --> 00:17:28.750
-What?
-If you and I just…

293
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.166
I need a therapist right now.
but naked Sundays…

294
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.208
-If. um…
-They're not gonna be on--

295
00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:35.250
Oh. no. Uh-uh.

296
00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:36.791
-Let's get married.
-Nope!

297
00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:39.250
-Nuh-uh! No! Get up! That's not happening!
-! Hey!

298
00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:40.750
-Hey! Hey!
-Get up!

299
00:17:40.833 --> 00:17:43.583
-He's not talking to you!
-You better be praying. Get up. Sit.

300
00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:48.916
-I've thought a lot since last night--
-Oh. a well-thought-out decision.

301
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.791
They've been thinking about this all--
Since last night.

302
00:17:51.875 --> 00:17:54.250
-Sorry. I thought it was a rash decision.
-We'll go back out.

303
00:17:54.333 --> 00:17:57.083
I thought this was a quick thing.
Like. "We're having a ba--"

304
00:17:57.166 --> 00:17:59.916
-No. they thought for four to six hours.
-It's okay. Use your head!

305
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.875
I don't know why
you're being so weird about this. Rick.

306
00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:05.041
-They clearly have this under control.

307
00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:13.333
What? Uh…

308
00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:16.583
-It's not as thought out as it could be.
-Gabe.

309
00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:18.458
-We're still figuring things out.
-Gabe.

310
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:20.125
-You know? Yeah…
-I know.

311
00:18:21.583 --> 00:18:23.958
You're gonna be such a good dad.

312
00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:30.375
And if I'm gonna be in this situation
with anyone. I'm glad that it's with you.

313
00:18:30.458 --> 00:18:31.666
Really.

314
00:18:32.916 --> 00:18:33.875
You know?

315
00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:38.791
But you wanna marry someone
that you're in love with. I know you do.

316
00:18:38.875 --> 00:18:40.416
Right? Obviously.

317
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.625
Right?

318
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.416
Right.

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:45.833

I'm trying to…

448
00:25:07.625 --> 00:25:10.708
There's a woman in there.
I applied for a job with her.

449
00:25:11.208 --> 00:25:12.750
You-- you applied for a job?

450
00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:15.666

451
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.000
-Lucy Galloway.
-So you're stalking a potential employer.

452
00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:19.708
-No! No!
-That's a bold move.

453
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:21.458
-I'm impressed. What's your play?
-I--

454
00:25:21.541 --> 00:25:22.541
No!

455
00:25:23.458 --> 00:25:24.833
I'm just trying…

456
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.083
Look. I'm trying
to take advantage of a situation.

457
00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:29.208
I just moved here.

458
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.750
You have to know people in this town.
and I don't know anyone.

459
00:25:32.833 --> 00:25:36.916
So I was gonna… try to get in.

460
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.458
-You don't seem to be trying that hard.
-Well. because there's a man with a list.

461
00:25:40.541 --> 00:25:42.458
There's probably 100 names on that list.

462
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:45.916
He doesn't know whether you came out
to use the bathroom or get a drink.

463
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.625
So. come on.

464
00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:51.791
I just walk by him and smile and

465
00:25:52.791 --> 00:25:54.791
pretend like I know where I'm going?

466
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:02.583

488
00:27:29.375 --> 00:27:30.875
She doesn't come to these things.

489
00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:38.791
Okay. Well. she's not here.
So that was a waste of time.

490
00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:42.000
-Thank you for this. Good night.
-Hang on. You're not leaving.

491
00:27:42.083 --> 00:27:44.041
-Yeah.
-We just-- We just got in.

492
00:27:44.125 --> 00:27:48.041
She's not here. So I need to go home
and send out more résumés.

493
00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:50.041
-Right now?
-Yeah.

494
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.333
Okay. Well… well. we're here.

495

496
00:27:56.958 --> 00:27:59.000
I'm not gonna steal food.

497
00:28:00.166 --> 00:28:01.250
What do they have?

498
00:28:01.333 --> 00:28:03.916
I'm doing all right. you know.
LA's not the same without you.

499
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.500
but I'm doing my best
to live the dream for both of us.

500
00:28:07.583 --> 00:28:10.250
I found someone to take your room.
She's cool.

501
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.791
And I start that new job tomorrow.
Any advice?

502
00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:16.875
Maybe just don't be late for work.

503
00:28:16.958 --> 00:28:18.333
Mm. Good idea.

504
00:28:18.833 --> 00:28:19.666
Yeah.

505
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.916
Hey. Nat. Did you know that
everyone in LA has a job title.

506
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.500

507
00:28:25.125 --> 00:28:25.958
No.

508
00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:27.916
Yeah. well. I met this girl last night

509
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.333
who said she was
a supervisor for gifted youth.

510
00:28:30.416 --> 00:28:32.125
Um. I don't know what that means.

511
00:28:32.208 --> 00:28:33.208
Yeah. I didn't either.

512
00:28:33.291 --> 00:28:36.625
Apparently. she's just the nanny
for some celebrity's kids.

513
00:28:37.375 --> 00:28:39.708
Oh. LA is so weird.

514
00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:42.000
Anyway. how are you?

515
00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:44.625
Um…

516
00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:48.916
I'm kinda terrible. actually.

517
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Um…

518
00:28:50.666 --> 00:28:55.541
Yesterday. I just basically ate crackers
and took three naps.

519
00:28:55.625 --> 00:28:59.000
and then threw up for the rest of the day.

520
00:28:59.625 --> 00:29:03.000
-Oh. honey. I'm sorry.

521
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.833
I mean. that's normal. right?

522
00:29:05.916 --> 00:29:06.958
-Yeah.
-It…

523
00:29:07.583 --> 00:29:09.208
It's part of the process.

524
00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:11.458
I'm sure it'll get better.

525
00:29:12.166 --> 00:29:14.333
-Hey. have you been drawing much?

526
00:29:16.291 --> 00:29:17.916
-Nat?
-No.

527
00:29:20.416 --> 00:29:21.541
Oh…

528
00:29:22.125 --> 00:29:23.291
Can I. um…

529
00:29:24.708 --> 00:29:29.375
can I just call you back later
so I can cry on this couch by myself?

530
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.166
Yeah. course.

531
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.750
-I'm here if you need anything.
-Okay. Okay. I love you.

532
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.541
-I love you.
-Bye.

533
00:29:43.875 --> 00:29:45.250
Oh…

534
00:29:57.791 --> 00:29:58.625
Hello?

535
00:29:58.708 --> 00:30:00.708
Hi. Natalie Bennett?

536
00:30:00.791 --> 00:30:04.416
-This is she.
-Hi. I'm calling about your application.

537
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.541
Are you free this afternoon or tomorrow
to come in?

538
00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.208
Yeah.

539
00:30:09.708 --> 00:30:10.666
Great. Uh…

540
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.333
-Natalie. Hi.

541
00:30:26.416 --> 00:30:27.500
Hi…

542
00:30:27.583 --> 00:30:30.291
I found your résumé. and I had Hannah
put it at the top of the pile.

543
00:30:30.375 --> 00:30:32.375
-Jake.
-Um… uh. yeah.

544
00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:34.000
Yeah. you remember. That's so sweet.

545
00:30:34.083 --> 00:30:35.125
You work here.

546
00:30:35.208 --> 00:30:38.750
Yeah. The fact that you studied both
2D and 3D animation is your selling point.

547
00:30:38.833 --> 00:30:41.208
You gotta lead with that.
Do you know how to roll calls?

548
00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:44.916
Don't answer that.
When she asks you. the answer is "yes."

549
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.541
Why did you not tell me
that you worked here?

550
00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:50.541
Ah. it didn't come up. I don't know.
I thought you might be nuts.

551
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:55.791
You thought I might be nuts? You knew.
hey. that Lucy wasn't even in there.

552
00:30:55.875 --> 00:30:57.333
Of course I knew
Lucy wasn't in there.

553
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
You can't just accost a major player
at an event.

554
00:31:00.083 --> 00:31:03.833
It's like-- like a valet handing Spielberg
his screenplay along with his car keys.

555
00:31:03.916 --> 00:31:05.000
Accosting her…

556
00:31:05.083 --> 00:31:07.875
Well… I didn't know
what you were gonna do.

557
00:31:07.958 --> 00:31:10.625
Look. the point is.
there aren't many people in this town

558
00:31:10.708 --> 00:31:13.833
who would rather print out résumés
on a Friday night than hang at a party.

559
00:31:13.916 --> 00:31:15.416
-Hmm.
-That's why you're here.

560
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.125
Nice blazer. Don't wear it.
You're not a real estate agent.

561
00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:22.708
-Natalie?

562
00:31:22.791 --> 00:31:23.958
-Uh…
-You ready?

563
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:25.666
Yes. Weird.

564
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.458
You're just my idol. I've…

565
00:31:35.958 --> 00:31:37.833
I just love everything that you've
ever done.

566
00:31:37.916 --> 00:31:39.375
-Shh.
-You're such an--

567
00:31:39.958 --> 00:31:41.416
Talking too much.

568
00:31:44.333 --> 00:31:45.750
Mm…

569
00:31:47.708 --> 00:31:48.791
Hmm.

570
00:31:51.375 --> 00:31:53.000
Very interesting.

571
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.458
Can I borrow your face?

572
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.916
Mm… What? My face?

573
00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:09.166
Okay. Uh… Why don't we try happy?

574
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.958
Gleeful!

575
00:32:12.458 --> 00:32:13.791
Why don't you try anger?

576
00:32:13.875 --> 00:32:15.166
-Anger?
-Yeah.

577
00:32:16.875 --> 00:32:18.458
What about confused?

578
00:32:19.166 --> 00:32:21.916
-I'm so sorry. Who are you?
-Natalie Bennett.

579
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.791
-Natalie Bennett.
-Yes.

580
00:32:24.458 --> 00:32:28.791
Natalie Bennett
with a paper folded résumé.

581
00:32:29.666 --> 00:32:33.541
Okay. so you studied 3D?

582
00:32:34.958 --> 00:32:36.458
-And 2D.
-Mm.

583
00:32:36.541 --> 00:32:38.625
I'm actually more of an illustrator.

584
00:32:39.208 --> 00:32:41.666
So what was that.
some sort of hybrid situation?

585
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.000
-No. I doubled.
-Oh.

586
00:32:44.083 --> 00:32:45.416
After doing my research.

587
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.500
I figured that I'd have a better shot
at getting a job if I knew how to do both.

588
00:32:49.583 --> 00:32:54.083
And. um… it's not like 3D
is devoid of illustration these days.

589
00:32:54.166 --> 00:32:56.666
You have Spider-Verse. Paperman…

590
00:32:58.041 --> 00:33:00.625
New draft is in.
They wanna discuss it for--

591
00:33:00.708 --> 00:33:02.791
-Sorry.
-Oh my God. You're Shay Tanzie.

592
00:33:03.666 --> 00:33:05.125
Oh. I was just-- I was just gonna say

593
00:33:05.208 --> 00:33:08.750
I loved your homage to Fiver
in Rabbit Lost.

594
00:33:08.833 --> 00:33:11.750
It was… beautiful.

595
00:33:11.833 --> 00:33:12.666
Thanks.

596
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:16.041
And you got Tucker
to do the background work on that. yeah?

597
00:33:16.125 --> 00:33:17.541
Uh… Mm-hmm.

598
00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:18.750
Amazing.

599
00:33:19.875 --> 00:33:20.791
Who's this?

600
00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:22.333
Natalie Bennett.

601
00:33:23.416 --> 00:33:24.791
She's here for the job.

602
00:33:25.458 --> 00:33:26.500
Oh.

603
00:33:27.458 --> 00:33:28.916
Uh. can you roll calls?

604
00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:31.166
Yes.

605
00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:50.458
Here you go.

606
00:33:54.125 --> 00:33:57.458
And that's it? It's so fast.

607
00:33:57.541 --> 00:34:01.208
-Well. it's strong. Just listen.

608
00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:06.166
-Wanna know if it's a boy or a girl?
-Is it a boy or a girl?

609
00:34:09.541 --> 00:34:10.750
It's a little girl.

610
00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:12.875
-Girl!

611
00:34:41.416 --> 00:34:42.666
Oh!

612
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.833
-Ugh! Cara! Roach! Roach!

613
00:34:56.875 --> 00:34:58.916
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

614
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.666
Happy New Year!

615
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.291
It's gonna be a great one!

616
00:35:02.375 --> 00:35:03.500
Happy New Year!

617
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.375
First year's torture for everybody.

618
00:35:14.458 --> 00:35:17.041
It's long days. late nights.
Very little sleep.

619
00:35:17.125 --> 00:35:19.625
Did you have a social life
that you liked before this?

620
00:35:19.708 --> 00:35:21.083
-Not really.
-Very good.

621
00:35:21.166 --> 00:35:22.750
That would never have survived.

622
00:35:22.833 --> 00:35:25.166
It's like having a child. basically. Um…

623
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.708
Keep your head down. eyes on the prize.
Soon. you'll have your own assistant.

624
00:35:29.291 --> 00:35:30.958
Have you always wanted
to work in animation?

625
00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:33.041
Honestly. no. Nothing against animation.

626
00:35:33.125 --> 00:35:36.416
But. um… I think
it's more of a stepping-stone for me.

627
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.083
-Uh-huh.
-Um. I moved around a lot as a kid.

628
00:35:39.166 --> 00:35:42.291
Met a lot of interesting people.
A lot of weird places.

629
00:35:42.375 --> 00:35:43.458
Mm.

630
00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:46.125
Eventually. what I wanna do
is kinda tell those stories.

631
00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:48.875
I don't know whether
it's narrative or documentary. but. um…

632
00:35:49.875 --> 00:35:52.333
that's what I wanna-- what I wanna do.
is tell those stories.

633
00:35:53.333 --> 00:35:54.166
What about you?

634
00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.333
Um… I stayed in the same place growing up.

635
00:35:57.416 --> 00:36:00.250
That's why I moved to LA.
so I could have those experiences.

636
00:36:00.333 --> 00:36:01.708
That's why I'm at this job.

637
00:36:02.916 --> 00:36:04.500
You're in the perfect position.

638
00:36:04.583 --> 00:36:08.208
For me. I think it's a slightly smaller
part of the five-year plan.

639
00:36:10.875 --> 00:36:12.000
The five-year plan?

640
00:36:12.083 --> 00:36:16.166
What's the quote? "If you fail to plan.
you should plan to fail."

641
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:17.416
Oh!

642
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.750
-What?

643
00:36:21.208 --> 00:36:22.625
I can't believe you just said that.

644
00:36:23.208 --> 00:36:24.666
I didn't. Benjamin Franklin said it.

645
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.791
But I used to say that all the time.

646
00:36:27.875 --> 00:36:30.000
and I would get so much shit for it.

647
00:36:30.083 --> 00:36:32.958
For quoting Benjamin Franklin
or for having a five-year plan?

648
00:36:33.041 --> 00:36:34.708
-For both.
-I don't understand that.

649
00:36:34.791 --> 00:36:37.458
-Why would anybody give you shit--
-I don't know!

650
00:36:37.541 --> 00:36:39.500
What is it?
What do people have against planning?

651
00:36:39.583 --> 00:36:41.583
What do people have against planning?

652
00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:43.791
I think it's great that
you have a five-year plan.

653
00:36:43.875 --> 00:36:45.833
-Me too.
-Cheers to five-year plans.

654
00:36:46.583 --> 00:36:47.750
To five-year plans.

655
00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:54.208
-What? I hate these books!

656
00:36:54.291 --> 00:36:55.166
These books suck.

657
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:57.791
Everyone says something different.
How do you know?

658
00:36:57.875 --> 00:36:59.750
How do you know which one to follow?

659
00:36:59.833 --> 00:37:02.041
-Uh…
-Eeeh! Oooh…

660
00:37:02.125 --> 00:37:03.916
-What's up?
-She's kicking a lot.

661
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.041
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

662
00:37:05.125 --> 00:37:06.541
Oh. wow!

663
00:37:07.791 --> 00:37:10.250
I think I'm having contractions.

664
00:37:10.333 --> 00:37:12.500
-What? Right now? That's-- Are you sure?
-Yeah.

665
00:37:12.583 --> 00:37:14.958
-I'm scared we're gonna screw this up.
-Okay.

666
00:37:15.041 --> 00:37:17.458
-We're gonna screw it up.
-Of course. That's unavoidable. but…

667
00:37:17.541 --> 00:37:18.708
-Oh shit.

668
00:37:18.791 --> 00:37:20.208
Your parents screwed you up. right?

669
00:37:20.291 --> 00:37:21.791
-My parents screwed me up.
-Yeah!

670
00:37:21.875 --> 00:37:23.083
Their parents screwed them up.

671
00:37:23.166 --> 00:37:25.083
That's the cycle
of people screwing each other up.

672
00:37:31.083 --> 00:37:32.541
-Okay.
-Ooh…

673
00:37:32.625 --> 00:37:33.541
Oh. oh. oh!

674
00:37:33.625 --> 00:37:36.583
We should stop at. um…
a Whataburger on the way.

675
00:37:36.666 --> 00:37:38.416
-For what?
-Because I need to eat.

676
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.166
-They're not gonna let me eat there.
-That's probably for a reason.

677
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.291
No! I'm about to push a baby
out of my vag.

678
00:37:43.375 --> 00:37:46.083
and I'm gonna do it
after eating a buffalo chicken sandwich.

679
00:37:46.166 --> 00:37:48.833
-Let's go!
-Okay. All right. Aah!

680
00:37:48.916 --> 00:37:49.958
Aah…

681
00:37:52.666 --> 00:37:54.000
Oh my God! My parents!

682
00:37:54.583 --> 00:37:56.500
I'm gonna call them. Don't worry.

683
00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:01.333
Um… This way.

684
00:38:01.416 --> 00:38:02.333
-This way? Okay.
-Yeah.

685
00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:04.458
-Did they stop at Whataburger?

686
00:38:04.541 --> 00:38:05.708
-Huh?
-That's my girl!

687
00:38:06.458 --> 00:38:09.625
Yeah. she's havin' major contractions.
but you're doin' a great job.

688
00:38:09.708 --> 00:38:11.833
We're makin' it happen.
This is how you do it.

689
00:38:11.916 --> 00:38:13.666
-You don't panic.
-Here we go.

690
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:16.875
You make things happen.
Guys? Come on. Hey. guys.

691
00:38:16.958 --> 00:38:18.291
-Rick!
-Yeah?

692
00:38:18.375 --> 00:38:20.833
Hey. you gotta
keep me posted on this stuff.

00:38:20.916 --> 00:38:22.750
-Here-- Oh. here it comes.

694
00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.916
Okay. it's gonna-- Here it comes.

695
00:38:25.541 --> 00:38:27.208
Breathe it through. Try to breathe.

696
00:38:27.291 --> 00:38:29.625
Do you want me to get you
a juice box or a water?

697
00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:31.291
-Okay.

698
00:38:31.875 --> 00:38:33.541
Oh. hey. quick question.

699
00:38:33.625 --> 00:38:36.375
Or forget it. Very busy. Sorry.

700
00:38:36.458 --> 00:38:40.041
I just realized I gotta relearn
all those lullabies I used to sing you.

701
00:38:40.125 --> 00:38:42.333
-I remember that.
-Yeah.

702
00:38:42.416 --> 00:38:44.166
-You're doin' great.

703
00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:45.416
Nine.

704
00:38:47.041 --> 00:38:49.375

705
00:38:49.458 --> 00:38:50.375
…seven…

706
00:38:52.083 --> 00:38:54.875
All right.
You're not goin' down. are you. Dad?

707
00:38:54.958 --> 00:38:56.458
No. I'm good. I'm good.

708
00:38:56.541 --> 00:38:59.458
-Okay. Five…
-I'm good. You got it. There you go.

709
00:38:59.541 --> 00:39:00.541
…four…

710
00:39:00.625 --> 00:39:01.666
There we go. Good.

711
00:39:02.708 --> 00:39:04.750
-Oh! All done!
-I-- Oh!

712
00:39:08.208 --> 00:39:09.958
Good job. Mom!

713
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.791
Here you go. Mom.

714
00:39:11.875 --> 00:39:13.500
Hi. baby.

715
00:39:14.083 --> 00:39:15.541
-Hi. baby!

716
00:39:16.083 --> 00:39:17.291
Hi. baby!

717
00:39:20.583 --> 00:39:21.791
Hi. Rosie.

718
00:39:29.958 --> 00:39:31.208
-Hey!
-Hi.

719
00:39:32.583 --> 00:39:37.416
Um. do you have
any kids experience. by chance?

720
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.875
No!

721
00:39:39.583 --> 00:39:41.333
Okay. Doesn't matter. Come with me.

722
00:39:44.333 --> 00:39:46.000
-What did you do?
-Oh my God!

723
00:39:46.625 --> 00:39:48.625
Uh. well. it's my birthday.

724
00:39:49.791 --> 00:39:50.833
Happy birthday.

725
00:39:51.416 --> 00:39:52.333
Thank you.

726
00:39:53.041 --> 00:39:55.250
And I wanted to pet one for my birthday.

727
00:39:55.333 --> 00:39:56.166
Okay.

728
00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.625
The other ones got jealous.
so I had to pet them too.

729
00:39:58.708 --> 00:40:00.291
You let them all out of the crate?

730
00:40:00.375 --> 00:40:02.375
-Yes. I did. That's what happened.
-Yeah.

731
00:40:02.458 --> 00:40:04.500
-I think it--
-They're eating the storyboards.

732
00:40:04.583 --> 00:40:07.500
-Oh my God. they are. Wow. Okay. Um…

733
00:40:08.416 --> 00:40:11.625
All right. you get the storyboards.
I will handle…

734
00:40:11.708 --> 00:40:13.166
I happen to be great with kids.

735
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.250
-You go first.

736
00:40:16.166 --> 00:40:17.750
I leave you alone for five minutes.

737
00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:21.083
-You get up on the table.
-Excuse me. Aah… Pardon me.

738
00:40:21.166 --> 00:40:23.541
Hi. buddy. Oh. sorry.
Not what I had in mind.

739
00:40:23.625 --> 00:40:24.958
No. no. no. No. no. no.

740
00:40:25.041 --> 00:40:27.666
-This thing does not want to stop. Aah!
-They've run amok.

741
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.708
-They're eating the things.
-Come on. guys. Just chase 'em away.

742
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:33.541
-Excuse me. Go! Hey. hey. hey.
-You're doing great. You're a natural.

743
00:40:34.875 --> 00:40:36.083
Put your face on his face.

744
00:40:36.166 --> 00:40:39.291
I dare you.
Put your face on his face. It's so soft.

745
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:41.916
Aw!

746
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.041
Oh! Shh!

747
00:40:46.125 --> 00:40:49.250
-Sh. sh. sh!

748
00:40:51.166 --> 00:40:52.833
-Oh. baby.
-Hey.

749
00:40:54.125 --> 00:40:55.000
{\an8}Oh no!

750
00:40:55.083 --> 00:40:57.250
{\an8}-It's up her back.
-Take her to the tub. please.

751
00:41:00.916 --> 00:41:02.625
-Sh. sh. sh.

752
00:41:02.708 --> 00:41:04.833
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Whoa!

753
00:41:04.916 --> 00:41:08.833
Gabe. you're gonna wanna point
the explosive end away from you. okay?

754
00:41:08.916 --> 00:41:11.250
Can you give me a hand?
I can't reach the--

755
00:41:11.333 --> 00:41:12.541
If you can believe it.

756
00:41:12.625 --> 00:41:14.708
these are the moments
you're gonna miss the most.

757
00:41:14.791 --> 00:41:16.666
Good night.

758
00:41:20.333 --> 00:41:21.166
Goats?

759
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:23.041
-There were a lot of them.
-Why?

760
00:41:23.125 --> 00:41:27.250
Because it was Jake's birthday.
He wanted to let them out and pet them.

761
00:41:27.333 --> 00:41:28.875
It was really cute.

762
00:41:29.625 --> 00:41:33.708
Can I come work with you. meet Jake?
It sounds like you guys have fun.

763
00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:36.500
-I hate my job.

764
00:41:36.583 --> 00:41:37.708
Shh!

765
00:41:38.208 --> 00:41:39.083
Wha--

766
00:41:39.916 --> 00:41:40.916
Hello?

767
00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:44.166
You are so loud!

768
00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:46.583
You are so loud!

769
00:41:46.666 --> 00:41:49.458
-Also. this is not a library!

770
00:41:49.541 --> 00:41:50.416
Well--

771
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:54.750
-Here! Pretend!
-What--

772
00:41:56.333 --> 00:41:57.791
Oh my God!

773
00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:02.208
Hey! I'm keeping this book.

774
00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.125
You!

775
00:42:08.208 --> 00:42:09.041
No. no.

776
00:42:09.125 --> 00:42:12.333
I'm not going to sleep
because I'm your night owl.

777
00:42:13.708 --> 00:42:15.583
-What else? You nocturnal?

778
00:42:16.375 --> 00:42:17.958
Yeah. you're nocturnal?

779
00:42:18.541 --> 00:42:20.625
And-- and you got business to biz

780
00:42:20.708 --> 00:42:23.000
-and-- and papers to file.

781
00:42:23.083 --> 00:42:27.250
-Oh. what else you gotta do?
-What else you gotta do. little night owl?

782
00:42:28.625 --> 00:42:30.208
-Little night owl. you got…
-Aww…

783
00:42:31.583 --> 00:42:34.666
You got what? Em-- employees to fire!

784
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:36.583
-You got employees to fire? No!
-Okay.

785
00:42:36.666 --> 00:42:38.708
-Okay. we won't fire employees. no.
-We won't.

786
00:42:38.791 --> 00:42:40.333
No. no. Sh. sh.

787
00:42:40.416 --> 00:42:42.208
-Sh. sh. sh.
-Sh. sh. sh.

788
00:42:42.291 --> 00:42:44.291
Sh. sh. sh…

789
00:42:44.375 --> 00:42:45.791
-Yeah?

790
00:43:29.333 --> 00:43:31.041
-Nat. you okay?
-Yep.

791
00:43:33.583 --> 00:43:37.250
-Okay. that doesn't sound okay.
-Yeah.

792
00:43:37.333 --> 00:43:39.333
-What is it?
-It's just the hormones.

793
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:43.250
-And I'm--
-Okay. I know.

794
00:43:44.333 --> 00:43:45.166
Okay.

795
00:43:45.958 --> 00:43:50.416
I want you to know that this…
this is normal.

796
00:43:52.833 --> 00:43:54.416
This doesn't feel normal.

797
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.666
Well. it is.

798
00:43:57.666 --> 00:43:58.791
-Okay.

799
00:43:59.958 --> 00:44:03.791
There's this thing that happens when
you get pregnant. No one talks about this.

800
00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:08.625
But you… you mourn a little bit.

801
00:44:09.833 --> 00:44:13.500
You mourn. you know.
the person that you used to be.

802
00:44:14.125 --> 00:44:19.125
Because the fact is.
no matter how much you wanna be a mom.

803
00:44:19.708 --> 00:44:23.541
you're never not going to be one again.

804
00:44:25.125 --> 00:44:27.875
-Not to freak you--

805
00:44:27.958 --> 00:44:29.541
-Okay.
-It's a…

806
00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:31.958
That is a huge brain adjustment.

807
00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:36.000
You are letting go of your old self.

808
00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:39.333
Yeah.

809
00:44:41.083 --> 00:44:44.500
But Dad and I are there for you.
no matter what.

810
00:44:47.208 --> 00:44:49.833
All right. We are almost done.

811
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.208
What's going on? Everything okay?

812
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.625
-Haircut.
-Oh.

813
00:44:56.708 --> 00:44:58.125
I felt disgusting.

814
00:44:58.208 --> 00:45:00.875
And we're actively dealing with it. right?

815
00:45:00.958 --> 00:45:02.125
Right.

816
00:45:02.208 --> 00:45:03.458
Take a look at this.

817
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:06.458
There's still a little bit.
but what do you think of this length?

818
00:45:06.541 --> 00:45:09.041
Oh boy! That looks great!

819
00:45:09.125 --> 00:45:10.958
I look like a mom.

820
00:45:13.083 --> 00:45:14.625
And that's a good thing. right?

821
00:45:14.708 --> 00:45:16.708
Mom jeans. dad bods.

822
00:45:16.791 --> 00:45:18.666
-Parenting is cool now. right?
-No.

823
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.208
Doesn't mean a "mom"
just 'cause it's that length.

824
00:45:21.291 --> 00:45:23.000
I don't want to look like one.

825
00:45:23.083 --> 00:45:24.333
-Wow.
-This looks bad. I hate it.

826
00:45:24.416 --> 00:45:27.708
I loved it when you had
that haircut at her age. Loved it.

827
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:30.958
You loved everything about me
when I was her age.

828
00:45:31.041 --> 00:45:33.333
-I love everything about you at every age.
-Really?

829
00:45:33.416 --> 00:45:34.583
-Yeah.
-Prove it.

830
00:45:34.666 --> 00:45:35.583
Okay.

831
00:45:35.666 --> 00:45:38.541
-Can you guys give us a moment?

832
00:45:39.166 --> 00:45:40.250
-Yeah.

833
00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:42.541
We will be in our room. You look cute.

834
00:45:43.041 --> 00:45:46.958
I can do. you know.
some point cutting to even--

835
00:45:47.625 --> 00:45:49.083
I think it looks nice.

836
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:53.750
What's up? Hmm?

837
00:45:55.333 --> 00:45:57.916
Talk to me. I know it's not--
I know it's not the hair.

838
00:46:02.375 --> 00:46:05.375
I just feel like
I don't have a life anymore.

839
00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:10.083
Mm.

840
00:46:12.875 --> 00:46:14.625
Because I don't draw.

841
00:46:16.958 --> 00:46:19.208
I don't see my friends.

842
00:46:24.416 --> 00:46:27.375
I don't do anything. I feel like…

843
00:46:30.416 --> 00:46:31.708
I'm just this.

844
00:46:31.791 --> 00:46:35.416
No. no. no. no. No. you're…
You're everything.

845
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:36.916
-Hmm.
-You are. You are.

846
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.125
You're doing so much. and… and…

847
00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:43.291
you're doing it on. like. two hours
of sleep every three days.

848
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:46.208
It's incredible.

849
00:46:46.291 --> 00:46:47.916
You're-- you're literally keeping

850
00:46:48.416 --> 00:46:51.208
a small little human alive
just on your own.

851
00:46:53.041 --> 00:46:54.708
You're doing an amazing job.

852
00:46:56.125 --> 00:46:58.875
And this is gonna be
the toughest thing you ever do in life.

853
00:47:00.416 --> 00:47:01.375
Ever.

854
00:47:05.916 --> 00:47:08.916
When you get through this.
and you will get through this.

855
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.500
you're gonna take off like if Elon
built you himself. whoosh. like a rocket.

856
00:47:13.583 --> 00:47:14.875
I promise you!

857
00:47:22.208 --> 00:47:23.666
And you look beautiful.

858
00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:25.791
like you always do.

859
00:47:31.791 --> 00:47:33.833
Here we go!

860
00:47:33.916 --> 00:47:36.833
-Half a cake for half a birthday!
-Whoa!

861
00:47:36.916 --> 00:47:38.500
Look what's coming!

862
00:47:38.583 --> 00:47:40.541
-That is unbelievable.
-Wow!

863
00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:42.000
Look at that!

864
00:47:42.083 --> 00:47:44.291
Look at her face.
She doesn't even know what to do.

865
00:47:44.375 --> 00:47:46.291
-Can you believe that?
-Wow!

866
00:47:46.375 --> 00:47:48.541
-That's a cake!
-You want some? Oh!

867
00:47:48.625 --> 00:47:50.000
-Want some cake?
-Sh. sh!

868
00:47:50.083 --> 00:47:51.875
-That's for you. bubby.
-Look. Ro!

869
00:47:51.958 --> 00:47:55.333
This little old lady!
You're half a year old!

870
00:47:55.416 --> 00:47:56.916
Oh yeah!

871
00:47:59.291 --> 00:48:00.375
Hi!

872
00:48:00.458 --> 00:48:02.750
-You want some cake. Ro?
-Here we go.

873
00:48:02.833 --> 00:48:04.291
-Everybody ready?
-There we go.

874
00:48:04.375 --> 00:48:07.750
-Aww!
-Okay. I don't wanna crop Gabe out.

875
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:10.666
Get in there. Okay. you ready?

876
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:12.666
-There you go!
-Here we go!

877
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:15.083
-Aah! Yeah!
-One. two. three. yeah!

878
00:48:15.666 --> 00:48:16.708
Hannah!

879
00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:19.875
-Hannah. I need coffee right away.

880
00:48:19.958 --> 00:48:22.458
She's always upset
about the goat legs.

881
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.791
Hi. Um. I have just a couple ideas
for Billy. The--

882
00:48:45.875 --> 00:48:48.375
I didn't ask for ideas.
I asked for coffee.

883
00:48:50.916 --> 00:48:51.791
Yes.

884
00:48:52.791 --> 00:48:56.666
I tried to show her.
She just doesn't see me as an artist.

885
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:58.583
{\an8}I didn't think it would be so difficult.

886
00:48:58.666 --> 00:49:02.041
{\an8}Maybe I should leave and become a barista.
I don't know.

887
00:49:02.125 --> 00:49:04.083
Have you ever considered leaving?

888
00:49:04.166 --> 00:49:05.416
Uh…

889
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:06.916
Actually. I. um…

890
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.291
You know. I got a job. another job.

891
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.291
-Uh…
-You did?

892
00:49:11.375 --> 00:49:13.333
Yeah. I don't know
if I'm gonna take it. though.

893
00:49:13.416 --> 00:49:16.375
It's a small documentary
production company.

894
00:49:16.458 --> 00:49:19.541
A lateral move. at best. Pay cut.

895
00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:21.833
Although technically.
I would be a producer.

896
00:49:21.916 --> 00:49:23.125
You would be a producer?

897
00:49:23.208 --> 00:49:24.875
Yeah. but like a baby producer. It--

898
00:49:24.958 --> 00:49:26.916
You should do it. You should--

899
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.875
This is moving in the direction
you wanna move in. Take the job.

900
00:49:29.958 --> 00:49:33.166
They're shooting a heli-ski documentary.
You know what heli-skiing is?

901
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:35.541
-No.
-It's jumping-out-of-helicopters skiing.

902
00:49:35.625 --> 00:49:37.708
-I'd get to--
-Oh! You would do this?

903
00:49:37.791 --> 00:49:40.708
-Not me. but I'd go with the guys who do.
-Watch people do it.

904
00:49:40.791 --> 00:49:42.750
Yeah. I'll get to go to Switzerland and…

905
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:45.875
Oh God. Alaska. Chile. Japan. hopefully.

906
00:49:45.958 --> 00:49:48.250
I hope I get to go to Japan.
I always wanted to go.

907
00:49:48.333 --> 00:49:49.333
Oh my God!

908
00:49:49.416 --> 00:49:51.666
This movie…

909
00:49:52.583 --> 00:49:53.416
this movie…

910
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.791
The animation director of this movie.
her work is so beautiful.

911
00:49:56.875 --> 00:49:57.875
When I first saw it.

912
00:49:57.958 --> 00:50:01.833
it-- it. like. gave me the same feeling
as when I first saw Spirited Away.

913
00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:02.750
-Ah!
-You know?

914
00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.375
-Love Spirited Away.
-Mm-hmm?

915
00:50:04.458 --> 00:50:06.250
I've-- I've been saying for years.

916
00:50:06.333 --> 00:50:09.500
somebody should make
a live-action remake of Spirited Away.

917
00:50:09.583 --> 00:50:11.625
You have not been saying that for years.

918
00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:14.375
-Yes. What's wrong with that?
-No. Oh my God.

919
00:50:14.458 --> 00:50:16.333
-What's the matter with that?
-No!

920
00:50:16.416 --> 00:50:19.208
-What's wrong with a remake?
-I'm walking away.

921
00:50:19.875 --> 00:50:20.791
Wha--

922
00:50:21.333 --> 00:50:23.958
What do you--
What's-- what's so bad about that?

923
00:50:25.166 --> 00:50:26.166
Okay.

924
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:27.708
Making…

925
00:50:29.375 --> 00:50:33.083
a live-action remake
of an animated film

926
00:50:33.166 --> 00:50:38.750
is like trying to tell somebody
about your dream that you had last night.

927
00:50:38.833 --> 00:50:41.458
The magic never translates.
It never works.

928
00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:45.958
Okay. so you-- you don't think
there's any value in taking one story

929
00:50:46.041 --> 00:50:47.708
and telling it two different ways?

930
00:50:47.791 --> 00:50:50.041
Why do you need a live-action version

931
00:50:50.125 --> 00:50:54.625
when the animated interpretation
is always so much more beautiful?

932
00:50:54.708 --> 00:50:56.958
It conveys what reality can't.

933
00:50:57.041 --> 00:51:01.333
You're saying that there is
no live-action remake of an animated film

934
00:51:01.416 --> 00:51:04.166
that isn't as good
or a little bit better than the original?

935
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:06.208
-Not one?
-Name-- name one.

936
00:51:06.291 --> 00:51:08.291
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Boom.

937
00:51:08.375 --> 00:51:10.333
2014?

938
00:51:10.416 --> 00:51:11.916
No. not 2014. 1990.

939
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.125
Oh!

940
00:51:13.208 --> 00:51:15.625
There are more. by the way.
I could name you more.

941
00:51:15.708 --> 00:51:16.958
Well. please.

942
00:51:17.041 --> 00:51:19.083
-If I had my notes in front of me.

943
00:51:19.166 --> 00:51:20.166
Okay.

944
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:24.916
I got 'em.

945
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:30.875
Okay. Um…

946
00:51:31.375 --> 00:51:35.333
Okay. So I see myself
in one just above Sunset.

947
00:51:35.416 --> 00:51:37.500
Mm. House in the Hills. Classic.

948
00:51:37.583 --> 00:51:38.583
Mm--

949
00:51:38.666 --> 00:51:42.375
But also an animation studio
just off the PCH.

950
00:51:42.458 --> 00:51:44.541
Oh. the traffic's gonna be a nightmare.

951
00:51:45.416 --> 00:51:48.125
That's okay.
I will have a studio off the PCH.

952
00:51:48.208 --> 00:51:50.208
That's true. Right.
Close to the beach. That's good.

953
00:51:51.166 --> 00:51:52.333
Oh!

954
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.375
Yeah. What about you?

955
00:51:54.458 --> 00:51:56.833
Aah… I'm a man of simple tastes.

956
00:51:56.916 --> 00:51:59.666
I just need a small production studio.
you know.

957
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.000
-Fifty. sixty employees. you know.

958
00:52:03.083 --> 00:52:05.666
Four-bedroom apartment directly above it.

959
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:10.250
So you want a…
a bougie high-rise in Brentwood

960
00:52:11.125 --> 00:52:15.416
or just. like. a $30 million
sprawling mansion.

961
00:52:16.041 --> 00:52:16.958
Mid-century?

962
00:52:17.541 --> 00:52:18.958
No. No. no. Not at all.

963
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:20.583
-Oh. thank God.
-No. um…

964
00:52:20.666 --> 00:52:21.791
-I'm so sorry.
-Uh. no. no.

965
00:52:21.875 --> 00:52:26.041
I-- I want something.
you know. warm and soulful. Um…

966
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.500
My friend once described me
as a blueberry muffin.

967
00:52:29.583 --> 00:52:31.458
-So I need something sort of…

968
00:52:31.541 --> 00:52:32.583
I love muffins.

969
00:52:32.666 --> 00:52:34.291
…in keeping with that.

970
00:52:34.375 --> 00:52:36.750
I'm thinking. like.
a Spanish bungalow. you know.

971
00:52:36.833 --> 00:52:40.041
rooted in the past
but with an eye towards the future.

972
00:52:40.541 --> 00:52:42.416
-I just made that up.
-I love that.

973
00:52:44.541 --> 00:52:47.125
-Five years. you think?
-Mm… Probably six.

974
00:52:47.208 --> 00:52:48.833
Six. Sounds more realistic.

975
00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:52.541
-It's-- Things take a while here.
-Yeah. Some things.

976
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:58.500
So how do we get there?
You know. how do we make this happen?

977
00:52:58.583 --> 00:53:00.416
How do we achieve these things?

978
00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:03.166
-"We"?
-Yeah. Oh. well…

979
00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:06.791
-"We." as in individual "we's."
-Right.

980
00:53:11.875 --> 00:53:12.750
What?

981
00:53:16.583 --> 00:53:19.208
You know. when I moved to LA. um…

982
00:53:20.833 --> 00:53:23.333
I moved to LA because I thought I had to.

983
00:53:23.416 --> 00:53:24.750
-Yeah.
-You know? For work.

984
00:53:24.833 --> 00:53:25.750
Mm-hmm.

985
00:53:25.833 --> 00:53:29.291
I just realized I've spent
so much of the time since I've been here

986
00:53:29.375 --> 00:53:33.916
trying to convince myself that
this was the place I was supposed to be.

987
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:34.916
Mm.

988
00:53:37.708 --> 00:53:39.583
I don't feel that way anymore.

989
00:53:45.791 --> 00:53:48.583
I feel like this is definitely
where I'm supposed to be.

990
00:53:52.666 --> 00:53:54.583
This feels like where I'm supposed to be.

991
00:53:55.083 --> 00:53:55.916
Good.

992
00:54:07.125 --> 00:54:08.333
Shh!

993
00:54:15.958 --> 00:54:17.250
Oh!

994
00:54:20.583 --> 00:54:21.666
Oh.

995
00:54:23.875 --> 00:54:24.750
Hi. I'm Jake.

996
00:54:25.333 --> 00:54:27.041
-Cara.
-Nice to meet you. Cara.

997
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.250
It's good to be met.

998
00:54:32.791 --> 00:54:34.083
I was just leaving.

999
00:54:34.166 --> 00:54:35.333
Oh. yeah.

1000
00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:37.750
I'm glad I got to meet you.

1001
00:54:39.916 --> 00:54:40.916
Hi!

1002
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:45.750
-Hey. what's up?
-Hi. I brought you a housewarming gift.

1003
00:54:45.833 --> 00:54:48.666
-Oh. wow. you shouldn't have. This is--
-For both of us.

1004
00:54:49.708 --> 00:54:51.416
-To share.
-Hmm--

1005
00:54:52.083 --> 00:54:54.708
I don't remember the last time
we both had a night off.

1006
00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:57.166
I know. Congratulations. Cheers.

1007
00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:00.416
-Cheers.
-This place is really great. Mm.

1008
00:55:02.166 --> 00:55:03.125
Thank you.

1009
00:55:03.208 --> 00:55:06.791
Look it! You have your own little…
You've got such a nice space.

1010
00:55:06.875 --> 00:55:09.625
-Yeah.
-Your own little practice space!

1011
00:55:09.708 --> 00:55:12.416
Well. I'm gonna be
my neighbors' favorite. so…

1012
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.458
Uh. you know what? They're lucky.

1013
00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:17.208
-They're lucky to hear you play.
-Are they?

1014
00:55:17.291 --> 00:55:18.916
-You're gonna go at it. Okay.
-Yeah.

1015
00:55:21.625 --> 00:55:23.541
-Put this foot over there.
-What do I do? Oh.

1016
00:55:23.625 --> 00:55:25.083
-That foot there--

1017
00:55:25.166 --> 00:55:26.125
This is…
-God.

1018
00:55:27.291 --> 00:55:28.625
You gotta really kick it. Kick it.

1019
00:55:28.708 --> 00:55:30.666
-Kick it like you mean it.
-It scares me.

1020
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:33.875
-Kick it like you mean it. It's gonna…

1021
00:55:33.958 --> 00:55:36.708
Okay. Now. let's go with a soft roll.

1022
00:55:40.583 --> 00:55:42.000
Speed it up. speed it up!

1023
00:56:02.541 --> 00:56:03.708
Whoa. hold on.

1024
00:56:04.541 --> 00:56:05.500
Sorry.

1025
00:56:06.375 --> 00:56:07.583
Sorry.

1026
00:56:07.666 --> 00:56:08.750
Uh…

1027
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:13.500
Let's. uh… let's talk about--
Let's talk about this.

1028
00:56:13.583 --> 00:56:14.791
Uh…

1029
00:56:14.875 --> 00:56:15.750
Okay.

1030
00:56:16.458 --> 00:56:17.541
For a minute.

1031
00:56:19.166 --> 00:56:21.500
-Yeah.
-You know. because last time.

1032
00:56:22.875 --> 00:56:25.000
we said it wasn't gonna be a big deal.

1033
00:56:25.083 --> 00:56:28.500
and then it was. like.
the biggest deal ever.

1034
00:56:28.583 --> 00:56:34.541
And it could be even bigger
now that Rosie's… involved.

1035
00:56:36.125 --> 00:56:37.000
So…

1036
00:56:38.958 --> 00:56:41.375
Yeah. yeah. it definitely… It can… Um…

1037
00:56:43.083 --> 00:56:45.166
Which is why I was just kind of…

1038
00:56:46.666 --> 00:56:49.500
I was thinking that maybe
you and Ro could move in here with me.

1039
00:56:53.166 --> 00:56:56.666
No pressure. but you could set up
your little art studio right there.

1040
00:56:56.750 --> 00:57:00.666
and there's. like. two good schools
in the neighborhood for Ro.

1041
00:57:01.375 --> 00:57:03.375
Um… If we're thinking that far ahead.

1042
00:57:03.458 --> 00:57:06.541
I think it would be-- would be prudent
to think about where she goes to school.

1043
00:57:06.625 --> 00:57:07.541
Um…

1044
00:57:08.875 --> 00:57:11.416
Okay. uh. it just seems like…

1045
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.541
I can barely keep my head above water
as it is.

1046
00:57:15.625 --> 00:57:18.166
and the idea of moving
and not having my parents--

1047
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:20.625
We could be doing that stuff together.
you know. just--

1048
00:57:21.958 --> 00:57:25.416
just as-- as co-parents or…

1049
00:57:28.541 --> 00:57:30.750
just as… just as parents.

1050
00:57:34.208 --> 00:57:36.125
What's the worst thing that could happen?

1051
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.708
You know. we could give this a real shot
and-- and see where it goes.

1052
00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:43.916
This could end badly.
Gabe. you and I. we're so different--

1053
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.541
-Is that a bad thing?
-I don't want to lose this.

1054
00:57:46.625 --> 00:57:50.375
What if we can never go back to this?
This is-- this is good. This works.

1055
00:57:50.458 --> 00:57:52.416
What if. what if. what if. what if…

1056
00:57:53.458 --> 00:57:56.083
What if it works well? What if it--
What if it works amazing?

1057
00:57:56.166 --> 00:57:58.250
What if it just is the beginning of. like…

1058
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.375
this beautiful thing that we create?

1059
00:58:03.208 --> 00:58:04.500
You know. like. what if that?

1060
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.708
What if Ro gets to be
with both of her parents… together?

1061
00:58:10.875 --> 00:58:13.083
I'm scared. I'm sorry.

1062
00:58:13.166 --> 00:58:16.333
I can't. I'm--
I don't-- I can't risk this.

1063
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:19.166
I don't wanna risk this.

1064
00:58:21.208 --> 00:58:24.125
Just for Ro. I'm sorry. I can't.

1065
00:58:27.541 --> 00:58:28.625
That's…

1066
00:58:30.666 --> 00:58:31.666
I get it. Um…

1067
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:34.458
Just because I'm not ready
doesn't mean you can't be ready.

1068
00:58:35.833 --> 00:58:38.250
Enjoy this space. you know?

1069
00:58:38.333 --> 00:58:40.416
-Yeah. I mean…
-Go start dating!

1070
00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:43.083
-Dating…
-Or not. I don't know.

1071
00:58:43.166 --> 00:58:44.375
No. I…

1072
00:58:50.583 --> 00:58:52.166
If you want.

1073
00:58:58.291 --> 00:58:59.208
Okay.

1074
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:05.208
Okay.

1075
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.291
…'cause she is so cute!

1076
00:59:15.375 --> 00:59:16.708
Come here. baby girl!

1077
00:59:16.791 --> 00:59:19.125
-Oh. big burp! Big burp!
-Oh. go to Momma.

1078
00:59:19.208 --> 00:59:21.166
-Huh.

1079
00:59:21.791 --> 00:59:22.833
I miss you.

1080
00:59:22.916 --> 00:59:23.958
I miss you.

1081
00:59:24.041 --> 00:59:25.708
-I miss you too. A lot.
-Mm-hmm.

1082
00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:31.583
-Oh! Wait. I remember this.

1083
00:59:32.125 --> 00:59:35.333
You were always the most organized person
in the world with this thing.

1084
00:59:35.416 --> 00:59:37.166
They're just doodles.

1085
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.541
They're just doodles!

1086
00:59:38.625 --> 00:59:40.666
Just doodles?

1087
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:42.291
{\an8}No. these are…

1088
00:59:43.791 --> 00:59:45.166
{\an8}These are so good. Who is this guy?

1089
00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:48.791
{\an8}So. when Ro was first born.
she had her days and nights mixed up.

1090
00:59:48.875 --> 00:59:52.583
{\an8}So we started calling her
our little night owl. Boop!

1091
00:59:53.416 --> 00:59:54.500
{\an8}Beep!

1092
00:59:54.583 --> 00:59:58.541
{\an8}And Gabe does this little voice with her
where he makes her say things as the owl.

1093
00:59:58.625 --> 01:00:02.708
{\an8}and it's… it's just the cutest
and cringiest thing you've ever seen.

1094
01:00:02.791 --> 01:00:04.291
{\an8}Isn't that right?

1095
01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:10.041
So Gabe got his own place?

1096
01:00:10.916 --> 01:00:12.875
-Uh-huh.
-How's that been?

1097
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.250
Um. it sucks.

1098
01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:16.958
{\an8}Um. he offered to stay.

1099
01:00:17.041 --> 01:00:22.000
{\an8}but I actually told him
to go and get his own space and bed

1100
01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:25.041
{\an8}-and to put some women in it.

1101
01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:27.791
-Wait. it was-- it was your idea?
-Yeah. it was mine.

1102
01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:31.208
-Wh-- why would you do that?
-I don't know.

1103
01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:33.833
{\an8}I was overwhelmed.

1104
01:00:33.916 --> 01:00:36.791
{\an8}I started seeing him
as. like. this man for the first time.

1105
01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:40.291
{\an8}-and it was scary and overwhelming.

1106
01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:41.583
{\an8}And. um…

1107
01:00:43.166 --> 01:00:45.583
{\an8}And I screwed up! I screwed up!

1108
01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:49.583
Gimme a little smoochy!

1109
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.250
-You gotta keep goin'.
-Okay!

1110
01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:05.666
-Did you get one? Can I have one?
-Yes. you can have one.

1111
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:06.833
Oh!

1112
01:01:08.083 --> 01:01:10.625
Oh! That's… that's my poster.

1113
01:01:11.208 --> 01:01:12.708
That's my name!

1114
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.791
Stand by the poster.

1115
01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:20.333
Look. Wanna go see that?

1116
01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:23.125
-Are you gonna go see that?
-Yes.

1117
01:01:26.791 --> 01:01:29.291
-Don't do it.
-I don't have a technique. but I could…

1118
01:01:29.375 --> 01:01:31.833
I thought you were gonna say.
"I don't have a tongue."

1119
01:01:38.541 --> 01:01:40.958
I'm gonna be the lead producer
on the Sable Island project.

1120
01:01:41.041 --> 01:01:42.791
-You are?
-Yeah. It's never gonna happen.

1121
01:01:42.875 --> 01:01:44.333
-It won't get funded.
-Don't say that.

1122
01:01:44.416 --> 01:01:48.208
-It's cool that it's my project.
-It is. Oh my God! That's amazing!

1123
01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:51.083
And I was thinking maybe
we could look for a place together.

1124
01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:54.541
You and me move… Get a place together?

1125
01:01:54.625 --> 01:01:57.208
-You know… Yeah. unless you don't want to.
-No. no. I--

1126
01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:00.166
I want to. You wanna-- you want to?

1127
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.958
-Then let's do it.
-I think we should do it.

1128
01:02:03.041 --> 01:02:04.333
I'll start looking.

1129
01:02:04.416 --> 01:02:05.791
Aww!

1130
01:02:05.875 --> 01:02:08.041
This-- I can't--
This thing's defective. I--

1131
01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:09.208
Seriously?

1132
01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:12.750
Oh. oh! I'm just trying
to get the mud off your foot.

1133
01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:14.833
-I'm sorry!

1134
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:18.958
She's almost as cute
as Natalie was as a baby.

1135
01:02:19.041 --> 01:02:20.708
We made that baby.

1136
01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:23.458
I mean. through one other baby.

1137
01:02:23.541 --> 01:02:25.458
-I get it. I follow.
-Yeah. Okay.

1138
01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:26.916
How you doin'. buddy?

1139
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.125
Pretty good.

1140
01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.625
-Hey. Gabe!
-All right…

1141
01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:33.333
-Hey.
-Oh. hey!

1142
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:34.833
Who's that?

1143
01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:38.708
I think that's Miranda. His new lady.

1144
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:40.416
-No kiddin'.
-She's cute.

1145
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.208
I want big bubbles!

1146
01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:45.625
-That's nice she's here.
-Yeah.

1147
01:02:45.708 --> 01:02:47.583
-Good for him.
-I know.

1148
01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:50.333
What have you got…

1149
01:02:50.416 --> 01:02:51.541
-Nothing…
-Hi!

1150
01:02:51.625 --> 01:02:52.500
Hi.

1151
01:02:53.916 --> 01:02:55.625
Can I talk to you inside for two seconds?

1152
01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:02.791
What's up?

1153
01:03:02.875 --> 01:03:05.833
I just didn't know
that Miranda was gonna be here today.

1154
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.000
You-- you told me to bring a guest.

1155
01:03:08.083 --> 01:03:10.500
Yeah. but I just don't know her.

1156
01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:13.500
and now she's at my parents' house…

1157
01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.208
And?

1158
01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:19.583
Now she knows that I live with my parents.
and that just is weird to me.

1159
01:03:19.666 --> 01:03:20.708
Why wouldn't she?

1160
01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:24.000
She's in my life.
And I want her to be in ours.

1161
01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:25.750
Get to know Rosie.

1162
01:03:30.291 --> 01:03:32.625
But. um… I do have to thank you. though.

1163
01:03:33.208 --> 01:03:34.083
For what?

1164
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:35.791
Um…

1165
01:03:36.708 --> 01:03:38.250
Well. if it wasn't for you…

1166
01:03:39.375 --> 01:03:42.041
telling me to get out there
and start dating again. I…

1167
01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:47.125
I wouldn't have met her. so thank you.

1168
01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:52.708
Well. then. you're welcome.

1169
01:04:10.791 --> 01:04:12.916
-Oh. that was fun.

1170
01:04:13.708 --> 01:04:14.666
Yeah.

1171
01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:20.291
-Okay. bye.

1172
01:04:20.375 --> 01:04:21.708
-Right up. Yep.
-Okay. See ya.

1173
01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:23.791
Bye.

1174
01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:27.541
Well. well. well.

1175
01:04:28.208 --> 01:04:29.208
Nice.

1176
01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:30.208
Yeah. You know?

1177
01:04:30.291 --> 01:04:34.750
Things do be moving fast around here.
Gotta keep up. Whew!

1178
01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:36.333
I was gonna eat that.

1179
01:04:36.416 --> 01:04:38.291
-It's okay. We have more.
-Do you?

1180
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.541
-Yeah. in the kitchen.
-I'll get some. Want somethin'?

1181
01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:43.875
No. I'm okay. Oh. wait! But wait. hold on.
I wanna show you something.

1182
01:04:46.041 --> 01:04:48.000
I'm gonna show Lucy my portfolio.

1183
01:04:49.166 --> 01:04:53.166
and I want
your brutally honest opinion. please.

1184
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:54.750
-Hell. yes.
-Take a look.

1185
01:05:00.125 --> 01:05:01.291
You just swipe.

1186
01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:16.041
Wow.

1187
01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:21.625
These are great.

1188
01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:24.958
-Yeah?
-When are you gonna show her?

1189
01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:29.291
-Soon. Sometime soon.
-Uh-huh.

1190
01:05:29.375 --> 01:05:31.500
You should 'cause
you're gonna wrap soon. right?

1191
01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:34.166
-Yeah?
-She'll be staffing up her next project.

1192
01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:36.208
-You want her thinkin' of you.
-True.

1193
01:05:37.208 --> 01:05:41.000
I don't know. It's hard to.
like. sell myself in that way.

1194
01:05:42.791 --> 01:05:44.375
You have to ask for what you want.

1195
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:46.833
Okay?

Yes. Yes.

01:06:05.125 --> 01:06:06.416
-I do.
-You sure?

1203
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.500
-Mm-hmm.
-Amazing.

1204
01:06:07.583 --> 01:06:10.791
Well. please tell the team
that we are locking the final sequence!

1205
01:06:10.875 --> 01:06:12.375
-Yay!
-Yes!

1206
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.083
Uh…

1207
01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:21.291
Now that you maybe have a spare moment.
would you be able to look at my portfolio?

1208
01:06:21.375 --> 01:06:22.708
If you have the time--

1209
01:06:22.791 --> 01:06:25.333
Absolutely. I would love to.
Just please send me the link.

1210
01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:27.166
Thank you. Thank you.

1211
01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:32.208
But she hasn't even opened the link.

1212
01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:34.625
You gotta give people a month
before you follow up.

1213
01:06:35.666 --> 01:06:37.333
-A month?
-Yes. a month.

1214
01:06:38.208 --> 01:06:40.041
What the hell are people doing?

1215
01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:45.833
Oh. did you see the. um…
the Highland Park one?

1216
01:06:45.916 --> 01:06:50.166
It has a cute tile bathroom. and it's.
like. a walk away from Donut Friend.

1217
01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.250
which is… nice.

1218
01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:54.458
Did you-- What?

1219
01:06:54.541 --> 01:06:55.416
Uh…

1220
01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.125
We got the funding
for the Sable Island project.

1221
01:06:59.000 --> 01:06:59.875
Okay.

1222
01:07:00.833 --> 01:07:02.541
I'm gonna have to go to Nova Scotia.

1223
01:07:02.625 --> 01:07:04.333
-Oh. well--
-For six months.

1224
01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:06.875
For six months?

1225
01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:08.625
-Or maybe a year.
-Oh my God.

1226
01:07:09.166 --> 01:07:10.083
Yeah.

1227
01:07:12.583 --> 01:07:15.041
-Ah. it's just bad timing.
-Yeah.

1228
01:07:16.375 --> 01:07:19.125
So we're not
looking for an apartment. then?

1229
01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:20.250
I mean…

1230
01:07:22.041 --> 01:07:23.291
we can still.

1231
01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.291
-I just--
-You won't…

1232
01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:28.875
You just won't be living in it.

1233
01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:32.083
Yeah.

1234
01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:36.208
-It's okay. Hey. It's okay. It's fi--
-I'm sorry.

1235
01:07:36.291 --> 01:07:37.625
Don't be sorry.

1236
01:07:38.125 --> 01:07:40.041
This is so great for you.

1237
01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:42.458
We'll make it work.
I'm not worried about it.

1238
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Okay.

1239
01:07:45.375 --> 01:07:47.000
-Let's get ice cream.
-Okay.

1240
01:07:53.916 --> 01:07:55.041
-Bye. babe.
-Bye.

1241
01:07:55.125 --> 01:07:57.125
Whee!

1242
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.625
Okay. I'll see you soon. okay? Mwah!

1243
01:08:01.708 --> 01:08:02.875
Go ahead.

1244
01:08:02.958 --> 01:08:04.416
Have fun while I'm away.

1245
01:08:04.916 --> 01:08:06.041
Let's go.

1246
01:08:28.583 --> 01:08:30.875
-Hi!
-Hey!

1247
01:08:32.125 --> 01:08:33.208
You made it!

1248
01:08:33.708 --> 01:08:35.958
-Yeah. only took me four years.
-Mm!

1249
01:08:36.708 --> 01:08:39.125
-I got the invite to Nicole's baby shower.
-Yeah.

1250
01:08:39.208 --> 01:08:41.791
-You gonna go to that?
-I have to go. I live a block away.

1251
01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:45.875
-Right. Well. if you're going. I'll go.
-Mm! I'll get to see you again!

1252
01:08:45.958 --> 01:08:47.291
Yeah!

1253
01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:48.291
I guess.

1254
01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.125
Thank you for having me here.

1255
01:08:50.208 --> 01:08:52.041
Yeah! Course!

1256
01:08:52.125 --> 01:08:53.291
Yeah. but…

1257
01:08:54.333 --> 01:08:57.625
I needed to get away.
and I'm just thankful to be here.

1258
01:08:57.708 --> 01:09:01.625
I love having you here.
And literally. any time. by the way.

1259
01:09:01.708 --> 01:09:05.791
You know. My couch is your couch.
This is your home too. okay?

1260
01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:09.125
Thank you. I'm gonna get some juice.
Do you want any?

1261
01:09:09.208 --> 01:09:10.333
No. I'm okay.

1262
01:09:11.208 --> 01:09:12.166
Be right back.

1263
01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:13.083
Okay.

1264
01:09:15.625 --> 01:09:17.791
-Oh shit.
-Oh God. I am so sorry.

1265
01:09:17.875 --> 01:09:19.541
No. it's okay. Um…

1266
01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:21.833
-It's fine. No. don't worry about it.
-Aah… There.

1267
01:09:21.916 --> 01:09:24.541
They're old. It's fine.
Seriously. it's fine.

1268
01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:26.125
You shouldn't have said that.

1269
01:09:26.208 --> 01:09:28.458
I was gonna insist
on buying you a round of drinks.

1270
01:09:28.541 --> 01:09:33.291
Oh. well. then. you know.
they're actually vintage and priceless.

1271
01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:35.708
-I love it a lot. So…
-Yeah. That's what I thought. I--

1272
01:09:35.791 --> 01:09:37.833
I deeply apologize.
and I owe you a round of drinks.

1273
01:09:37.916 --> 01:09:40.000
-You actually don't have to.
-No. I'm going to.

1274
01:09:40.083 --> 01:09:41.458
-Oh. okay.
-And sorry again.

1275
01:09:41.541 --> 01:09:42.458
Thank you.

1276
01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:51.833
I would love to grab that table some…

1277
01:09:56.791 --> 01:10:00.458
I really cannot imagine
what my life would have been like here.

1278
01:10:00.541 --> 01:10:01.750
-What?
-Mm-mm.

1279
01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:04.500
-That's a lie.
-No. 'cause it's very overwhelming.

1280
01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:06.416
Whatever. Wasn't meant to be.

1281
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.666
You were supposed to go
and have your gorgeous family.

1282
01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:12.041
Yeah.

1283
01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:16.500
I said I found a really good place
that's near here.

1284
01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:18.125
Uh…

1285
01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:20.416
Aah. sorry. I can't…

1286
01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:22.333
Hello?

1287
01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:24.500
Um. I miss you.

1288
01:10:24.583 --> 01:10:27.208
I-- I miss you too! I miss you!

1289
01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:29.958
I'm telling you about the apartment.
I emailed you. It's--

1290
01:10:30.041 --> 01:10:32.125
I can't hear what you're saying. Sorry.

1291
01:10:32.208 --> 01:10:35.541
-It has a really cute studio space for me.

1292
01:10:36.083 --> 01:10:37.125
Can you hear me?

1293
01:11:04.625 --> 01:11:05.458
Hey.

1294
01:11:05.541 --> 01:11:07.166
Uh. Blue Bottle?

1295
01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:09.916
What?

1296
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.916
Uh… Coffee?

1297
01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.208
Oh. yeah. yeah. Thank you.

1298
01:11:20.708 --> 01:11:22.083
Mm.

1299
01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:29.041
Hi. good morning!

1300
01:11:29.541 --> 01:11:30.583
Mommy!

1301
01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:32.916
How are you. baby?

1302
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:33.833
Good.

1303
01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:37.375
Good. I miss you.

1304
01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:40.166
Can I speak to your dad for a second?

1305
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:41.750
Daddy's not here.

1306
01:11:42.416 --> 01:11:43.583
No? Where is he?

1307
01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:46.708
Daddy said Jessie's in charge.

1308
01:11:49.083 --> 01:11:50.041
Who's Jessie?

1309
01:11:51.208 --> 01:11:53.208
She's a girl.

1310
01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:55.500
Has she been with you all night?

1311
01:11:55.583 --> 01:11:57.625
Yeah. she slept on the couch.

1312
01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:00.958
I miss you. When are you coming home?

1313
01:12:01.041 --> 01:12:04.041
I'm gonna come.
I'm gonna come. gonna see you soon. Okay?

1314
01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:07.750
Okay. Love you. I'll see you soon.

1315
01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:09.541
-Bye. Mommy.
-Bye. Ro.

1316
01:12:10.166 --> 01:12:11.625
What the fuck?

1317
01:12:23.083 --> 01:12:25.541
Yo. this is Gabe. Leave your message.

1318
01:12:26.833 --> 01:12:29.041
-Gabe. call me back right now.

1319
01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:32.291
Hey. Morning.

1320
01:12:32.375 --> 01:12:33.541
Hi.

1321
01:12:34.125 --> 01:12:37.708
Should we maybe get some brunch
before we go to the beach?

1322
01:12:37.791 --> 01:12:41.083
I think I have to go. Home.
I think I have to go home.

1323
01:12:42.166 --> 01:12:43.291
Wh--

1324
01:12:43.791 --> 01:12:44.750
Like…

1325
01:12:45.791 --> 01:12:47.833
-Uh-- Like Texas?
-Yeah.

1326
01:12:47.916 --> 01:12:49.833
-You just got here.
-No. I know.

1327
01:12:49.916 --> 01:12:50.958
Uh…

1328
01:12:51.041 --> 01:12:53.458
Rosie just called me.
She doesn't know where Gabe is.

1329
01:12:53.541 --> 01:12:55.750
I don't know where Gabe is.
He's not answering his phone.

1330
01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:58.250
She's with a sitter.
She was with a sitter all night.

1331
01:12:58.333 --> 01:13:00.666
Oh. she's with-- she's with a sitter?

1332
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:03.750
Yeah. but I don't know her.
I don't know who this person is.

1333
01:13:03.833 --> 01:13:05.041
Do you have to go home. though?

1334
01:13:05.125 --> 01:13:08.541
-I mean. I just took the week off work--
-I know. Yeah. No. I know.

1335
01:13:08.625 --> 01:13:13.208
-Like. we were gonna go and brunch and--
-Rosie-- Rosie just takes precedence over…

1336
01:13:15.041 --> 01:13:17.833
brunch and going to the beach. you know?

1337
01:13:18.666 --> 01:13:20.875
Yeah. yeah. Of course. Yeah.

1338
01:13:22.666 --> 01:13:24.000
-Hey.
-Some coffee?

1339
01:13:24.083 --> 01:13:25.166
Yeah. thanks.

1340
01:13:27.416 --> 01:13:29.500
Wanna go to the beach?

1341
01:13:29.583 --> 01:13:31.333
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1342
01:13:31.416 --> 01:13:32.416
Mm-hmm.

1343
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.458
Do you wanna get brunch?

1344
01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:37.750
Um…

1345
01:13:38.208 --> 01:13:39.750
You had a few days.

1346
01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:41.250
Hey. it's so much…

1347
01:13:45.458 --> 01:13:46.791
-Natalie?
-Yeah?

1348
01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:48.166
In my office. please.

1349
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:49.250
Yeah.

1350
01:13:51.208 --> 01:13:52.125
Yes?

1351
01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:56.000
Have a seat.

1352
01:14:03.458 --> 01:14:05.375
I'm gonna be really honest.

1353
01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:06.333
Okay.

1354
01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:17.416
There's definitely some skill there.
Nice perspective. beautiful shading…

1355
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.375
Thank you.

1356
01:14:19.166 --> 01:14:22.500
…but it. um… it feels a little derivative.

1357
01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:25.333
Oh. actually. a lot derivative.

1358
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:28.458
Okay. what do you mean?

1359
01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:30.500
Like you use some algorithm.

1360
01:14:31.041 --> 01:14:32.166
You see. you're smart.

1361
01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:35.666
You've done the work. That's a good thing.
That is a great thing.

1362
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:39.333
But it seems to me that you are drawing
what you think you should draw.

1363
01:14:39.416 --> 01:14:41.625
based on what already is.

1364
01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:44.541
You see. I see Barbera.

1365
01:14:44.625 --> 01:14:46.041
I see Chuck Jones.

1366
01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:48.041
I see Tissa David.

1367
01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:52.291
I even see a bit of myself.
but I don't see you in any of this.

1368
01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:55.041
Okay.

1369
01:14:55.666 --> 01:14:56.833
Maybe…

1370
01:14:58.333 --> 01:15:03.250
maybe you could help me find… my voice?

1371
01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:06.208
"Help you find your voice."

1372
01:15:06.291 --> 01:15:09.791
You know. I was an assistant at Pixar
for many years.

1373
01:15:09.875 --> 01:15:11.416
And I learned a lot. It was great.

1374
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.458
But the biggest lesson that I learned

1375
01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:18.750
was that I was spending so much time
helping other people find their voice

1376
01:15:18.833 --> 01:15:21.291
that I had no time to find my own.

1377
01:15:22.833 --> 01:15:25.125
And one day. I just quit.

1378
01:15:25.208 --> 01:15:28.458
and I took a shit job
that I didn't have to take home.

1379
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:32.291
and all I did every single day
was find my voice.

1380
01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:36.041
I didn't have a mentor.
I didn't have any help.

1381
01:15:37.541 --> 01:15:38.958
Do you understand?

1382
01:15:40.625 --> 01:15:42.250
Are you trying to tell me I should quit?

1383
01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:45.416
I'm telling you that
everybody has that moment in their life

1384
01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:48.000
where they have to decide
what's most important to them.

1385
01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:49.000
This.

1386
01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:53.083
This is… what's most important to me.

1387
01:15:54.541 --> 01:15:56.333
Then this is the moment.

1388
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.208
She fired you?

1389
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:09.208
No. but she basically told me that
all my work was unoriginal. uninspired.

1390
01:16:09.291 --> 01:16:15.416
and that I was copying other artists.
and that I should basically just quit.

1391
01:16:20.958 --> 01:16:22.166
Are you listening to me?

1392
01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:26.375
Yes. Yeah. I'm-- I'm sorry. Nat. That's--

1393
01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.083
-That's really unfair.

1394
01:16:29.833 --> 01:16:34.625
Okay. uh. what I'll do is. when I--
when I get a second. I'll. um. call Jenny.

1395
01:16:34.708 --> 01:16:37.083
-She had some leads for me…
-No! Please don't call Jenny.

1396
01:16:37.166 --> 01:16:39.000
I don't want you to help.

1397
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.166
I'm just trying to vent to you.

1398
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:45.083
I just wanna talk to my boyfriend
and feel comforted.

1399
01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:46.625
I just wanna connect with you.

1400
01:16:46.708 --> 01:16:50.875
because I feel like that doesn't really
happen very much these days.

1401
01:16:52.166 --> 01:16:54.541
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Um…

1402
01:16:55.041 --> 01:16:58.458
I've created space for you.
I've sent you apartment listings.

1403
01:16:58.541 --> 01:17:01.166
You don't even look at them.
You don't even answer me.

1404
01:17:01.666 --> 01:17:04.833
I'm trying to create a home
and a life with you. I wish you would…

1405
01:17:05.666 --> 01:17:09.208
I wish you would want
to include me in your plan.

1406
01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:13.125
Nat. I'm here on the phone with you.
I'm talking to you. I…

1407
01:17:13.208 --> 01:17:16.166
It is a ridiculous day here.

1408
01:17:16.916 --> 01:17:18.541
and I'm freezing my ass off.

1409
01:17:18.625 --> 01:17:21.791
and I'm on the other side
of the continent.

1410
01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:25.625
But I'm here. I'm talking to you.
I don't know what more you want from me.

1411
01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:27.791
I'm-- I'm doing my best here.
I know it sucks. but--

1412
01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:30.791
Maybe you are exactly
where you're supposed to be.

1413
01:17:30.875 --> 01:17:33.125
But right now. that is not with me.

1414
01:17:36.166 --> 01:17:39.041
This isn't working. It's just not working.

1415
01:17:47.875 --> 01:17:49.666
Right. well. if you feel
like it's not working.

1416
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:52.041
then it's not working. I'm sorry.

1417
01:17:59.458 --> 01:18:01.125
Okay. Bye.

1418
01:18:15.916 --> 01:18:16.875
Yeah. Hi.

1419
01:18:17.833 --> 01:18:19.583
Hi. Ro! Hi. baby!

1420
01:18:19.666 --> 01:18:21.291
-Hi. baby girl!
-Mommy!

1421
01:18:21.375 --> 01:18:23.666
Hi! I missed you!

1422
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:25.375
-Are you drawing?
-Yes.

1423
01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:26.958
Oh my God. It's so beautiful.

1424
01:18:27.041 --> 01:18:28.916
-Can you get your stuff? We're going home.
-Okay.

1425
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.333
Get your stuff. and we'll go.

1426
01:18:30.416 --> 01:18:31.875
And get your toys too.

1427
01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:34.416
All right. What's up?

1428
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.666
You left our daughter alone
with someone that I don't know?

1429
01:18:38.666 --> 01:18:40.750
-Not alone. With Miranda's sister.
-Yeah. I know.

1430
01:18:40.833 --> 01:18:42.833
You left her overnight
with a sitter I've never met.

1431
01:18:42.916 --> 01:18:46.083
-With Miranda's sister.
-Great. Gabe. I asked for one weekend.

1432
01:18:46.166 --> 01:18:48.375
One weekend
so I can visit my friend in LA.

1433
01:18:48.458 --> 01:18:50.625
-One weekend.
-No one told you to end your trip early

1434
01:18:50.708 --> 01:18:52.416
-and come in and start shouting!
-No. no!

1435
01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:53.916
-Call--
-My daughter called me.

1436
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.708
And I had to come home
to take care of her.

1437
01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:57.166
-I'm sorry. plans changed.
-What--

1438
01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:59.791
-She wasn't supposed to stay overnight.
-Something took precedence?

1439
01:18:59.875 --> 01:19:01.708
-You couldn't trust me?
-No. I had to come home.

1440
01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:03.833
-You're the only one that's responsible.
-Yeah.

1441
01:19:03.916 --> 01:19:05.666
Yeah. well. I proposed to Miranda.

1442
01:19:08.333 --> 01:19:10.416
That's what happened.
That's what spilled over.

1443
01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:16.208
Just some willy-nilly plan.
Just-- Yeah. just a proposal.

1444
01:19:22.208 --> 01:19:23.416
Oh my…

1445
01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:27.375

Oh.

1495
01:22:58.583 --> 01:23:02.708

that stuff also happens.

01:23:02.791 --> 01:23:04.666
Yeah. yeah. yeah. Mm.

1497
01:23:07.125 --> 01:23:09.041
Are you still doing any drawing?

1498
01:23:09.125 --> 01:23:12.583
I still have that last picture
that you drew for me up on my fridge.

1499
01:23:12.666 --> 01:23:14.208
Oh. no. No.

1500
01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:17.708
No. not-- not really drawing either. so…

01:23:18.708 --> 01:23:20.625

-Wait. What?
-I know.

1506
01:23:27.958 --> 01:23:31.500
-I need to leave. I can't be here anymore.
-What? We just got here.

1507
01:23:31.583 --> 01:23:33.083
Hold on. Wait! Wait. wait. wait. Wait.

1508
01:23:33.166 --> 01:23:36.583
No. It's getting sad and pathetic
that I'm trying to explain to these people

1509
01:23:36.666 --> 01:23:39.083
that my life did not turn out
the way that I planned.

1510

-And we're literally doing it.
-Yeah.

1515
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:50.458
I'm gonna be living with you until I'm 40
because I'm broke.

1516
01:23:50.541 --> 01:23:52.583
I just lost my job.
I'm single. I'm gonna die alone.

It was a true nightmare.

1522
01:24:46.291 --> 01:24:48.041
-I couldn't do it.
-Hmm.

1523
01:24:48.125 --> 01:24:49.666

-What?
-Yeah.

1621

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.958
He's trying to set us up
with a gig at South-by. also.

1632
01:30:09.041 --> 01:30:12.791
So we'll try to maybe
line up. uh… the same weekend.

1633
01:30:12.875 --> 01:30:15.166
Your band is gonna play South-by?

1639
01:30:39.791 --> 01:30:42.833

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:46.750

1645
01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:04.916
So I just wanted to let you know.

1648
01:31:23.166 --> 01:31:24.791

Hi. Natalie Bennett.

1654
01:31:53.666 --> 01:31:54.833
Here you go.

1655
01:31:54.916 --> 01:31:55.916
Thank you.

1656
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.208
You're welcome.

1657
01:31:59.666 --> 01:32:01.458
-Hi!
-Natalie Bennett.

1658
01:32:04.125 --> 01:32:06.166
Here you go. That's yours.

1659
01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:08.375
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1660
01:32:09.541 --> 01:32:11.666
So you mentioned that Night Owl

1661
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:15.083
was inspired
by your daughter's bedtime routine.

1662
01:32:16.125 --> 01:32:20.500
Yeah. So the first few months.
she was basically nocturnal.

1663
01:32:20.583 --> 01:32:22.791
We were out of our minds.
and somewhere in there.

1664
01:32:22.875 --> 01:32:24.833
we started calling her
our "little night owl."

1665
01:32:24.916 --> 01:32:25.875
-Aww!
-There--

1666
01:32:25.958 --> 01:32:28.333
Normally. there was
an expletive thrown in there.

1667
01:32:28.416 --> 01:32:32.208
"Our little bleeping night owl!"
Cover your ears. baby.

1668
01:32:32.291 --> 01:32:34.375
-She's so cute.
-Thank you.

1669
01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:39.041
Uh. anyways. her dad and I would joke
that she must be having anxiety

1670
01:32:39.125 --> 01:32:41.916
about all the things
she had to do the next day.

1671
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.750
and it became a whole routine

1672
01:32:43.833 --> 01:32:49.208
where she was our overwhelmed.
stressed-out little zoot-suit-wearing owl.

1673
01:32:49.291 --> 01:32:51.083
and it was an inside joke.

1674
01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:52.875
We thought it was hilarious.

1675
01:32:52.958 --> 01:32:55.625
but we weren't sure if anyone else
would really find it amusing.

1676
01:32:55.708 --> 01:32:59.166
For myself. I do know
what it feels like to stay up all night

1677
01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:03.125
worried about the hundred things
that I have to take care of the next day.

1678
01:33:03.208 --> 01:33:05.750
Well. you can always call me
because I'm always awake.

1679
01:33:05.833 --> 01:33:07.625
-Okay. Maybe I'll do that!

1680
01:33:07.708 --> 01:33:09.583
-Great!
-It's so lovely to have you here today.

1681
01:33:09.666 --> 01:33:11.458

01:34:47.875 --> 01:34:50.666

1714
01:34:59.000 --> 01:34:59.916

1716
01:35:01.875 --> 01:35:03.250

1717
01:35:03.333 --> 01:35:05.083

1718
01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:07.708
This is-- That's-- It's--
Yeah. It's crazy.

1719
01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:09.500
I have to tell you something.

1720
01:35:09.583 --> 01:35:11.000
-Um…
-Mm-hmm?

1721
01:35:12.375 --> 01:35:14.166
You remember graduation night?

1722
01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:15.208
Mm-hmm.

1723
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.666
I took a pregnancy test that night.

1724
01:35:21.291 --> 01:35:25.166
-Oh…
-Which would have been…

1725
01:35:26.916 --> 01:35:29.833
Yeah. yeah.
It would have been mine. And-- and--

1726
01:35:29.916 --> 01:35:32.375

Why did you keep this from me?

1743
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:35.583
I didn't! I told you guys
from the first day I was a drummer.

1744
01:36:35.666 --> 01:36:38.791
-I did not believe you.
-You said I was a dry cleaner.

1745
01:36:39.375 --> 01:36:41.500
Unreal. Way to go.

1746
01:36:41.583 --> 01:36:43.458

-You want a beer? Beer?

1747
01:36:43.541 --> 01:36:45.458

-Yeah. Okay. Go with Gramps.

1748
01:36:45.541 --> 01:36:49.375
-Oh my God! Oh. there she goes.
-You wanna get a little tiny beer? Okay.

1749
01:36:50.125 --> 01:36:51.333
You were amazing.

1750
01:36:51.416 --> 01:36:53.500
-Mm… I was a little rusty.
-No.

1751
01:36:53.583 --> 01:36:54.541
Mm.

1752
01:36:55.708 --> 01:36:58.958
Where's Miranda? Is she gonna…
I thought she was gonna be here.

1753
01:37:00.291 --> 01:37:03.500
Uh… we… we ended things.

1754
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:06.041
-What?
-Yeah. It just…

1755
01:37:07.291 --> 01:37:09.333
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1756
01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:12.291
Yeah. I'm good.

1757
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.500
It was rough for a couple weeks.
obviously. but. um…

1758
01:37:20.708 --> 01:37:21.875
She just wasn't you.

1759
01:37:28.125 --> 01:37:30.625
Does anybody have
a spare ticket to this thing?

1760
01:37:30.708 --> 01:37:32.458
That they're--
Tickets that they're not using?

1761
01:37:32.541 --> 01:37:36.000
Extra tickets? Anybody have a ticket?
Do you have a ticket you're not using?

1762
01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:37.833
-Extra ticket. maybe?
-No. I'm sorry.

1763
01:37:37.916 --> 01:37:40.958
Does anybody have a spare ticket
they might be willing to give me?

1764
01:37:41.041 --> 01:37:41.875
Jake?

1765
01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:44.708
Hi.

1766
01:37:45.291 --> 01:37:46.500
Wow. you look…

1767
01:37:49.375 --> 01:37:50.333
Hi.

1768
01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:55.166
What are you doing here?

1769
01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:58.541
Well. uh… I was trying to surprise you.

1770
01:37:58.625 --> 01:38:00.666
This is not exactly how I planned this.

1771
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:02.458
-Yeah.
-But my flight got delayed in Toronto.

1772
01:38:02.541 --> 01:38:05.125
I just got here.
I didn't expect it to be sold out.

1773
01:38:05.208 --> 01:38:08.000
It's sold out.
That's tremendous! Well done!

1774
01:38:08.083 --> 01:38:10.791
You… came here for…

1775
01:38:12.375 --> 01:38:13.916
Your work let you come here?

1776
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Oh. no. no. Yes. technically. they did.
but. um… they weren't happy about it.

1777
01:38:18.083 --> 01:38:22.666
A lot of. uh… lot of angry conversations.
A couple of angry phone calls.

1778
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:25.041
One or two angry voice mails
I think I'm gonna have

1779
01:38:25.125 --> 01:38:27.375
when I turn my phone back on.

1780
01:38:27.458 --> 01:38:28.833
I gotta do what I gotta do.

1781
01:38:28.916 --> 01:38:30.083
Mm.

1782
01:38:32.916 --> 01:38:34.458
And I got your voice mail.

1783
01:38:36.166 --> 01:38:37.250
And the truth is.

1784
01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:41.875
I'd rather be here for you
than anywhere else in the world for me.

1785
01:39:14.333 --> 01:39:15.458
-That was…
-Natalie!

1786
01:39:15.541 --> 01:39:16.791
Miles to go…

1787
01:39:17.416 --> 01:39:18.583
-Oh. hi.
-Hi.

1788
01:39:18.666 --> 01:39:19.958
Uh. I'm sorry…

1789
01:39:20.041 --> 01:39:23.333
Hi. Lucy. I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

1790
01:39:23.416 --> 01:39:26.166
Oh. I was on a panel earlier.
and I saw your name on the program.

1791
01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:28.083
I wanted to come and say hello.

1792
01:39:29.166 --> 01:39:32.000
-I appreciate that. Thank you.
-Mm.

1793
01:39:34.583 --> 01:39:36.083
I know I was hard on you.

1794
01:39:36.625 --> 01:39:39.625
In the same way that people
were hard on me when I first started.

1795
01:39:41.791 --> 01:39:43.125
It's a hard industry.

1796
01:39:43.791 --> 01:39:44.833
It is.

1797
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.375
I could have done more.

1798
01:39:49.916 --> 01:39:52.958
You know. maybe you did
exactly what I needed you to do.

1799
01:39:53.541 --> 01:39:56.750
Well. either way. you found your voice.

1800
01:39:57.333 --> 01:39:59.125
-I'm very proud of you.

1801
01:40:01.916 --> 01:40:03.666
I wondered if you'd consider

1802
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:06.125
coming by my office
when you get back to Los Angeles.

1803
01:40:06.208 --> 01:40:09.208
because I'd love to see
what you're working on next.

1804
01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:15.166
Yes. Yes! I would love that.

1805
01:40:15.250 --> 01:40:16.750
Thank you. Lucy.

1806
01:40:16.833 --> 01:40:18.500
-You're welcome.

1807
01:40:19.458 --> 01:40:21.041
-I'll see you then.
-Yes.

1808
01:40:23.708 --> 01:40:26.750
Do you remember
the last time we were on this bridge?

1809
01:40:26.833 --> 01:40:28.750
Mm-hmm. Where it all started.

1810
01:40:29.625 --> 01:40:31.291
Where it all started.

1811
01:40:33.833 --> 01:40:35.708
That night. you said…

1812
01:40:37.625 --> 01:40:39.458
that you would be there for me.

1813
01:40:40.833 --> 01:40:45.416
And you have been. every step of the way.

1814
01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:46.625
Well. I've tried my best.

1815
01:40:46.708 --> 01:40:49.375
Well. you've been the greatest partner
in all of this.

1816
01:40:49.458 --> 01:40:52.083
-Oh. stop it.
-No. I'm not gonna st--

1817
01:40:52.166 --> 01:40:53.125
No.

1818
01:40:54.458 --> 01:40:58.458
You know. I've told myself all this time
that we should not be together…

1819
01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:02.875
because maybe we were
holding each other back from something.

1820
01:41:02.958 --> 01:41:06.958
and If things didn't work out. it would be
too complicated with Rosie. but I…

1821
01:41:09.125 --> 01:41:11.416
I don't want to worry about
if it doesn't work out.

1822
01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.375
because what if it does?

1823
01:41:14.416 --> 01:41:20.166
And I have been so stupidly
in love with you this whole time.

1824
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:26.791
Finally.

1825
01:41:27.541 --> 01:41:28.750
Finally?

1826
01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:32.083
Finally?

1827
01:41:32.166 --> 01:41:33.208
Finally.

1828
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:42.916
Wow.

1829
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.750
-That's so cool.

1830
01:41:46.708 --> 01:41:48.416
Can you wait here for two seconds?

1831
01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:49.833
-Are you gonna go in?
-Yeah. yeah.

1832
01:41:49.916 --> 01:41:51.291
-Will you hold these?
-Okay. Yeah.

1833
01:41:51.375 --> 01:41:53.083
-Okay.
-I'll be here.

1834
01:41:57.916 --> 01:41:59.250
I need to…

1835
01:41:59.333 --> 01:42:02.375
Thank God you haven't.
because that's another…

1836
01:42:02.458 --> 01:42:05.208
-You're doing it with me this time.
-I know.

1837
01:42:06.875 --> 01:42:08.875
-Will you give me a minute?
-Yeah.

1838
01:43:13.458 --> 01:43:14.458
You're okay.

1839
01:43:15.708 --> 01:43:16.833
