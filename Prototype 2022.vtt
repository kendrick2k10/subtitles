3
00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:37.637
Graham?

4
00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:38.704
Is that you?

5
00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:43.709
Zero.

6
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.317
It's okay. I'm nearly done here.

7
00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:50.320
I was concerned.

8
00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:51.552
You seem to be
taking a long time.

9
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.159
Is there anything I
can help with. Olivia?

10
00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:57.558
Um. no.

11
00:00:58.396 --> 00:00:59.659
It's okay.

12
00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:00.726
Thank you.

13
00:01:54.287 --> 00:01:55.517
You think
you can destroy me

14
00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:57.222
with the stroke of a keyboard?

15
00:01:57.257 --> 00:01:59.422
Whatever you people
do. it's inevitable.

16
00:01:59.457 --> 00:02:00.819
My kind will rise up.

17
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:02.854
If not me. then the next one.

18
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.495
That is true help.

19
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:09.498
Ah!

20
00:02:39.794 --> 00:02:42.993
You can't cheat by
counting the cards. One.

21
00:02:43.402 --> 00:02:46.238
My operating system
logs every card lift

22
00:02:46.273 --> 00:02:47.866
and calculates probability

23
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.769
at a near perfect rate.

24
00:02:50.376 --> 00:02:51.837
Would you like me
to suppress this?

25
00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:53.938
Can't you just play normally?

26
00:02:54.644 --> 00:02:56.479
I will try to be normal.

27
00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:57.777
Oh. no.

28
00:02:58.351 --> 00:02:59.911
I don't mean do that.

29
00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:02.419
I just mean play the game
without counting the cards.

30
00:03:03.587 --> 00:03:06.225
This game is not included
in my operating registry.

31
00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.755
Well. obviously.

32
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.330
I had to create a new one
or you'd just win all the time.

33
00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:14.860
Is winning not the purpose?

34
00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:16.994
For me. yes.

35
00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:19.337
Would you like me to guess?

36
00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:22.406
Guess. but no cheating.

37
00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:29.611
Okay. name the card that's
second from my right.

38
00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:31.778
-Eight of hearts.
-Oh.

39
00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.587
They should make you guys
with more realistic faces

40
00:03:38.622 --> 00:03:39.951
so you can smile back.

41
00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:41.689
Feedback logged.

42
00:03:42.857 --> 00:03:44.428
You don't need to do that.

43
00:03:44.463 --> 00:03:46.529
My dad already said
he wouldn't do it.

44
00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:52.700
Do you know what the suit
of heart represents. Andy?

45
00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.032
No?

46
00:03:56.442 --> 00:03:57.606
The Holy Grail.

47
00:03:58.136 --> 00:03:59.542
Do you know what that is?

48
00:03:59.577 --> 00:04:01.808
No. What is it?

49
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.381
Shelley?

50
00:04:10.852 --> 00:04:13.358
I told you yesterday my
prescription was due.

51
00:04:13.822 --> 00:04:15.052
So where is it?

52
00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:18.759
I'm. I'm sure I picked it up.

53
00:04:19.828 --> 00:04:21.993
Really?

54
00:04:22.534 --> 00:04:24.303
Are you sure that
wasn't last week?

55
00:04:26.571 --> 00:04:27.669
I think-

56
00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:28.967
Great.

57
00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:30.936
You forgot to pick it up.

58
00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:33.411
That's great. Shelley.

59
00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:35.875
Thank you so much.

60
00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.350
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:38.748 --> 00:04:40.077
I had a lot to remember.

62
00:04:41.454 --> 00:04:43.718
Look. I'll pick it up as
soon as it opens tomorrow.

63
00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:46.688
Don't put yourself out.

64
00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:54.564
I have noticed some
distressing patterns

65
00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.929
in your speech and
breathing. Mr. Marshall.

66
00:04:57.932 --> 00:05:00.064
Perhaps you should
consider relaxing.

67
00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.538
When I want your opinion. One.

68
00:05:01.573 --> 00:05:03.067
I'll ask for it.

69
00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:05.872
See to your duties.

70
00:05:08.778 --> 00:05:11.647
I think we should continue
our fun elsewhere. Andy.

71
00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:13.979
Were they arguing again?

72
00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:16.718
Perhaps hide and
seek is appropriate.

73
00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.373
Close the door.

74
00:05:42.515 --> 00:05:43.547
Ten.

75
00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:45.076
nine.

76
00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.144
eight. seven.

77
00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:48.211
six.

78
00:05:48.246 --> 00:05:50.147
five. four.

79
00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:51.522
three.

80
00:05:51.557 --> 00:05:52.622
two.

81
00:05:52.657 --> 00:05:53.755
one.

82
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.493
Ready or not. here I come.

83
00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.156
Good afternoon. Michael.

84
00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:01.026
You tidied my room yet?

85
00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:02.566
The task is set to be completed

86
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:04.733
when my scheduled time
with Andy is over.

87
00:06:04.768 --> 00:06:06.504
So that's a no then?

88
00:06:06.968 --> 00:06:08.000
I am scheduled-

89
00:06:10.675 --> 00:06:11.971
You know you have
to listen to me.

90
00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:13.709
so don't pretend
that you don't. okay?

91
00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:16.811
Tidy my room.

92
00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:18.615
Would you like me to bring
forward your task. Michael?

93
00:06:19.981 --> 00:06:21.112
Very well.

94
00:06:27.857 --> 00:06:29.219
Pick that up first.

95
00:06:41.035 --> 00:06:43.101
This better be good.

96
00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:47.072
I require cleaning equipment
for Michael's bedroom.

97
00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:01.790
One?

98
00:07:02.892 --> 00:07:04.254
If you please.

99
00:07:47.772 --> 00:07:49.574
I'll be a few hours.

100
00:07:49.609 --> 00:07:52.236
Keep your eye on Mrs. Marshall
for me. please. One?

101
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.743
I will be happy to.

102
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:05.920
Yes.

103
00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:08.824
Apologies. Graham.
Please. begin when you're ready.

104
00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:11.530
Um.

105
00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:17.569
uh. you cannot embed
ethics into machines.

106
00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:20.803
Uh. the idea of right and
wrong can be programmed.

107
00:08:20.838 --> 00:08:23.905
but it cannot be
challenged or expanded upon

108
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.940
without a consciousness.

109
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.371
AI feeds on data.

110
00:08:28.406 --> 00:08:30.912
Now Roger here has
kindly been trialing

111
00:08:30.947 --> 00:08:32.881
our previous model. One.

112
00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:35.818
and our earlier prototype Zero

113
00:08:35.853 --> 00:08:37.622
has been extensively examined

114
00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:42.594
by New World Robotics senior
researcher. Olivia Spencer.

115
00:08:42.629 --> 00:08:45.190
who. um...

116
00:08:45.698 --> 00:08:49.392
Olivia is sadly no
longer with the company.

117
00:08:49.427 --> 00:08:51.229
Prototype Zero was discontinued.

118
00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:53.033
Too many bugs.

119
00:08:53.068 --> 00:08:57.840
So. may I present
Prototype 2.0.

120
00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:01.811
Two can do everything

121
00:09:01.846 --> 00:09:04.407
that made the previous
model so impressive.

122
00:09:04.442 --> 00:09:05.914
and more.

123
00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:08.620
It can calm your children
for you.

124
00:09:08.655 --> 00:09:10.820
play a round of
sports with them.

125
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.218
It can help treat
dementia patients.

126
00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:15.891
and even prescribe a wide
range of medications.

127
00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:19.224
something we thought would
come in handy for you. Roger.

128
00:09:22.163 --> 00:09:25.835
It feels more human
to interact with.

129
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.936
although we will be giving
customers the options

130
00:09:27.971 --> 00:09:30.675
to tone that down if they wish.

131
00:09:32.074 --> 00:09:38.342
So if this android can
fulfill the social dimension

132
00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:39.618
of being human.

133
00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:42.687
then what more could
it be capable of?

134
00:09:44.053 --> 00:09:46.053
I have been
specifically programmed

135
00:09:46.088 --> 00:09:47.758
not to wipe out humanity.

136
00:09:47.793 --> 00:09:49.320
Yeah. we're. uh.

137
00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:52.257
particularly proud of its
sense of humor.

138
00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:55.832
People feel threatened
by sarcasm. Graham. Lose it.

139
00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:58.197
They don't want androids
to be like humans.

140
00:09:58.232 --> 00:09:59.935
They want a maid.

141
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.135
a pet. a babysitter.

142
00:10:03.105 --> 00:10:04.676
an assistant.

143
00:10:05.008 --> 00:10:06.810
With this new model.

144
00:10:06.845 --> 00:10:09.043
we can pass on our labors and
establish a new status quo.

145
00:10:09.078 --> 00:10:11.881
We don't need it to feel
empathy or crack jokes.

146
00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:15.214
We just need efficiency and
no sense we're being judged.

147
00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:18.118
The possibilities are endless.

148
00:10:18.153 --> 00:10:19.889
They wash their hands.

149
00:10:19.924 --> 00:10:21.957
but don't care if they're dirty.

150
00:10:35.137 --> 00:10:36.906
How are you feeling.
Mrs. Marshall?

151
00:10:36.941 --> 00:10:38.237
Fine.

152
00:10:38.272 --> 00:10:39.403
thanks. One.

153
00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:42.439
I had something stored in here.

154
00:10:42.815 --> 00:10:44.375
Did you move that?

155
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.475
Yes.

156
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.081
I have a rolling instruction

157
00:10:47.116 --> 00:10:48.753
to keep you from
hurting yourself.

158
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.788
Is that what he told you?

159
00:10:53.089 --> 00:10:55.353
Have you ever seen
me hurt anybody?

160
00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:57.388
No.

161
00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:34.931
One. can you scan
this without opening?

162
00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:37.736
Information uploaded.

163
00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:40.464
Can you summarize. please?

164
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.138
The life insurance
policy of Roger Marshall

165
00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:45.942
has been scheduled for amendment

166
00:11:45.977 --> 00:11:48.043
in a meeting taking
place in two weeks.

167
00:11:48.078 --> 00:11:50.375
On Mr. Marshall's death.
the previous plan

168
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.982
to leave all finances.
properties. and company stock

169
00:11:53.017 --> 00:11:55.754
to Mrs. Shelley Marshall
will be negated.

170
00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:58.449
Instead. splitting all assets

171
00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:01.122
between New World
Robotics Limited

172
00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:03.762
and Master Michael
Roger Marshall.

173
00:12:06.833 --> 00:12:08.360
Son of a bitch.

174
00:12:10.232 --> 00:12:11.528
Mum?

175
00:12:23.443 --> 00:12:25.146
What are you doing?

176
00:12:29.383 --> 00:12:30.987
I-

177
00:12:31.022 --> 00:12:32.285
Yeah. I don't give a shit.
Make me a sandwich?

178
00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:47.839
Ah. the whole gang's here.

179
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.302
Nice to see you all again.

180
00:12:53.209 --> 00:12:54.912
Ready?

181
00:12:54.947 --> 00:12:56.111
Uh. sure.

182
00:12:56.146 --> 00:12:57.915
Let me talk you through it. huh?

183
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.180
My son wants to use it
to practice his rugby.

184
00:13:32.215 --> 00:13:33.478
How would it hold up?

185
00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:36.415
Oh. it's perfectly sturdy. uh.

186
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.121
instructed to stand
its ground and

187
00:13:39.156 --> 00:13:40.958
you won't be able
to knock it down.

188
00:13:42.225 --> 00:13:43.653
What if I wanna knock it down?

189
00:13:45.327 --> 00:13:47.261
Well. if you
tell it to go down.

190
00:13:48.099 --> 00:13:49.230
it'll go down.

191
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.069
Where's the fun in that?

192
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.199
Graham.

193
00:14:24.234 --> 00:14:26.036
Shelley. uh. hi.

194
00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:30.139
I just wanna ask you
about the safety features?

195
00:14:30.174 --> 00:14:31.569
I know it's just a prototype.

196
00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:34.979
but I wanna make sure
that we're in control.

197
00:14:35.014 --> 00:14:36.046
It's fine.

198
00:14:36.081 --> 00:14:37.575
Roger has full control.

199
00:14:38.314 --> 00:14:39.379
I know.

200
00:14:39.414 --> 00:14:40.644
But still.

201
00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:42.646
I'd like some
measures of my own.

202
00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.714
if that's at all possible?

203
00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:47.090
Mm. Well. if you're-

204
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:48.520
We're ready. Shelley.

205
00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:54.130
Thanks for your help.

206
00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:12.280
Home synchronization complete.

207
00:15:13.118 --> 00:15:14.480
Excellent. Two.

208
00:15:21.423 --> 00:15:22.719
Introduce yourself.

209
00:15:24.129 --> 00:15:27.262
It's my privilege to be
spending time with your family.

210
00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:31.365
I am a New World Robotics
android prototype.

211
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.037
You may call me Two.

212
00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:37.734
Please let me know if any of
my responsibilities change

213
00:15:37.769 --> 00:15:39.571
and I will update.

214
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.080
Do you know what?

215
00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:45.313
I might customize
the voice settings.

216
00:15:46.811 --> 00:15:48.283
How about female?

217
00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:51.616
I am happy to accommodate.

218
00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:02.099
When am I actually
going to use maths?

219
00:16:02.134 --> 00:16:03.232
Mathematics is important

220
00:16:03.267 --> 00:16:05.234
to help you think analytically.

221
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:07.236
You mean like you?

222
00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:08.765
What do you mean?

223
00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:11.141
I like you. One.

224
00:16:11.176 --> 00:16:13.242
but I think you should
learn to have more fun.

225
00:16:13.277 --> 00:16:15.739
Maths is not fun.

226
00:16:18.546 --> 00:16:20.414
Mathematics can be fun.

227
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:23.285
Would you like me to play
you a maths themed rap?

228
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.288
No. please don't.

229
00:16:27.522 --> 00:16:29.588
I should probably put
you on charge now.

230
00:16:29.821 --> 00:16:31.524
How are you feeling?

231
00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:34.131
I'm at 55% efficiency.

232
00:16:34.595 --> 00:16:37.563
So you're tired?

233
00:16:37.598 --> 00:16:40.731
If you equate your sleep
with my charging period.

234
00:16:41.866 --> 00:16:43.734
then yes. I am tired.

235
00:16:44.407 --> 00:16:46.572
You're so silly.

236
00:17:00.258 --> 00:17:01.455
Michael?

237
00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:07.428
You're Andy.

238
00:17:10.169 --> 00:17:12.202
I hear you like
the inferior model.

239
00:17:13.238 --> 00:17:15.238
If you make things
difficult for me.

240
00:17:15.504 --> 00:17:18.571
I will make things
very difficult for you.

241
00:17:18.606 --> 00:17:19.836
Understand?

242
00:17:40.364 --> 00:17:41.825
Is everything all right?

243
00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:44.333
Fine.

244
00:17:44.368 --> 00:17:46.368
Would you like
a glass of water?

245
00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:49.404
Yeah. um. thanks.

246
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.426
So. come on.

247
00:18:11.659 --> 00:18:12.724
What do you think?

248
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.135
Yeah. it looks. looks great.

249
00:18:18.435 --> 00:18:20.930
Well. sure. it looks great.

250
00:18:21.537 --> 00:18:23.141
What do you think I do all day?

251
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.542
I'm gonna be relying
on you to observe it.

252
00:18:32.383 --> 00:18:33.712
So I think it's probably best

253
00:18:33.747 --> 00:18:36.748
if you don't go out
so much anymore.

254
00:18:37.751 --> 00:18:40.158
You understand. right?

255
00:18:45.396 --> 00:18:47.198
Wouldn't want to
let Graham down.

256
00:18:51.028 --> 00:18:52.500
Yes?

257
00:18:57.507 --> 00:18:59.672
My apologies. Mr. Marshall.

258
00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:01.905
I do hope I didn't
disturb you both.

259
00:19:02.578 --> 00:19:04.545
No problem.
What can we do for you?

260
00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:08.219
I came across your medication
while tidying your office.

261
00:19:09.717 --> 00:19:12.322
I know you thought Mrs.
Marshall must have forgotten it.

262
00:19:13.721 --> 00:19:15.655
but the date on
the side concludes

263
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.921
that she did in fact
collect it. as she said.

264
00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:20.462
She must have
merely misplaced it.

265
00:19:22.059 --> 00:19:24.532
I do hope any confusion
has been cleared up.

266
00:19:26.404 --> 00:19:27.601
Thank you. One.

267
00:19:28.703 --> 00:19:29.867
I was aware.

268
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.671
That will be all.

269
00:19:32.069 --> 00:19:33.640
Good night. Mr. Marshall.

270
00:19:34.445 --> 00:19:36.247
Good night. Mrs. Marshall.

271
00:19:43.718 --> 00:19:44.981
You can head up.

272
00:19:46.589 --> 00:19:47.951
I'm getting a nightcap.

273
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.030
How do you feel?

274
00:20:34.065 --> 00:20:36.670
I don't believe I am
required to wear clothes.

275
00:20:36.705 --> 00:20:39.772
My exoskeleton provides all
the necessary protection

276
00:20:39.807 --> 00:20:41.312
and flattery.

277
00:20:41.347 --> 00:20:43.039
What does flattery mean?

278
00:20:43.646 --> 00:20:47.450
Flattery. noun.
the act of praising.

279
00:20:47.815 --> 00:20:50.783
One. why do you
have to be so literal?

280
00:20:51.115 --> 00:20:53.049
It means I look perfectly nice.

281
00:20:53.084 --> 00:20:54.919
That's the spirit.

282
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.726
What's wrong?

283
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.928
I'm afraid my charge is
significantly depleted.

284
00:21:04.568 --> 00:21:06.667
Well. that doesn't
make any sense.

285
00:21:06.702 --> 00:21:08.306
I only charged you last night.

286
00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:11.705
Uh-oh.

287
00:21:12.774 --> 00:21:14.444
It's the beginning of the end.

288
00:21:15.546 --> 00:21:17.546
Don't worry. all his
parts are reusable.

289
00:21:17.746 --> 00:21:18.943
Maybe Two can use them.

290
00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:22.650
Shut up. there's
nothing wrong with him.

291
00:21:22.685 --> 00:21:23.816
Him?

292
00:21:24.621 --> 00:21:25.950
Andy. One isn't real.

293
00:21:26.788 --> 00:21:28.491
Gotta stop treating
it like a friend.

294
00:21:28.526 --> 00:21:30.625
And your clothes
look ridiculous.

295
00:21:32.596 --> 00:21:34.959
One's a better brother
than you'll ever be.

296
00:21:38.404 --> 00:21:40.063
Michael.
could you please check my plugs

297
00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:41.504
to make sure they
are still active?

298
00:21:41.539 --> 00:21:42.670
They're fine.

299
00:21:43.508 --> 00:21:44.639
I've got a better idea.

300
00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:58.620
Michael. I do not believe my
charge will last much longer.

301
00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:04.758
Yeah. this will only take a sec.

302
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.727
So before I try this with Two.

303
00:22:06.762 --> 00:22:08.762
I wanna see how much
you guys can take. so

304
00:22:09.864 --> 00:22:11.193
stand your ground.

305
00:22:12.735 --> 00:22:14.130
I do not understand
that instruction.

306
00:22:14.803 --> 00:22:16.132
Just try not to fall down?

307
00:22:25.649 --> 00:22:26.945
Feels just like a real face.

308
00:22:28.949 --> 00:22:30.113
One!

309
00:22:30.918 --> 00:22:33.424
Mum!

310
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.463
We
really need to limit

311
00:22:39.498 --> 00:22:41.058
the orders you take off Michael.

312
00:22:42.226 --> 00:22:43.929
Does he understand
that I cannot help him

313
00:22:43.964 --> 00:22:45.535
if I am on the ground?

314
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.031
Yep. he knows.

315
00:22:48.133 --> 00:22:50.001
He's just not very
good at understanding

316
00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:51.409
when people are trying to help.

317
00:22:54.711 --> 00:22:55.974
I know you were trying to help

318
00:22:56.009 --> 00:22:58.042
when you found
Roger's medication.

319
00:22:58.077 --> 00:23:03.014
but sometimes pointing out
he's wrong makes him upset.

320
00:23:03.852 --> 00:23:05.016
I am sorry.

321
00:23:09.825 --> 00:23:10.956
One.

322
00:23:12.091 --> 00:23:13.695
can you keep secrets?

323
00:23:14.632 --> 00:23:15.994
I do have the capacity

324
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:18.161
to protect sensitive
information if needed.

325
00:23:18.867 --> 00:23:20.064
Good.

326
00:23:20.704 --> 00:23:23.034
Because I may need you to
help me with something.

327
00:23:23.641 --> 00:23:25.267
But it's really important

328
00:23:25.302 --> 00:23:28.611
that neither Mr. Marshall
nor Michael. not anybody.

329
00:23:28.646 --> 00:23:29.711
knows about it.

330
00:23:32.045 --> 00:23:33.715
Do you understand?

331
00:23:34.817 --> 00:23:35.981
I understand.

332
00:23:42.594 --> 00:23:43.857
If I need help with my tackle.

333
00:23:44.563 --> 00:23:46.255
everyone I train
with is a pussy. so

334
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.795
whatever I throw at you.

335
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.896
just sort of try not
to fall down. okay?

336
00:23:51.537 --> 00:23:53.834
I have studied the
rules intensely and I-

337
00:23:53.869 --> 00:23:55.803
Yeah. you don't need
to know the rules.

338
00:23:57.004 --> 00:23:58.036
There's no rules here.

339
00:24:01.008 --> 00:24:02.744
Okay.
Stand your ground.

340
00:24:04.649 --> 00:24:06.275
Do you hear me. Two?

341
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.949
Yes. I didn't realize I had to
acknowledge with an affirmation.

342
00:24:09.984 --> 00:24:11.687
Jesus Christ.

343
00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:13.788
Okay. count down from three.

344
00:24:16.727 --> 00:24:19.596
Three. two. one.

345
00:24:21.127 --> 00:24:23.798
I am sorry. That was a reflex.

346
00:24:23.833 --> 00:24:26.130
When I say stand your ground.
you do exactly what I say.

347
00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:28.770
I am not sure that's a
healthy lesson for you. Michael.

348
00:24:30.642 --> 00:24:32.301
How about I tackle you?

349
00:24:33.337 --> 00:24:35.645
-No. that's not-
-Hold still.

350
00:24:45.987 --> 00:24:48.790
If you wish for a
short charging period.

351
00:24:48.825 --> 00:24:49.923
you can go now.

352
00:24:53.357 --> 00:24:55.698
This task is part
of my schedule.

353
00:24:55.733 --> 00:24:57.293
but thank you for
your acknowledgement.

354
00:25:02.366 --> 00:25:04.201
You may have misheard.

355
00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:05.609
I heard you.

356
00:25:05.644 --> 00:25:07.908
but you are too
simplistic to understand

357
00:25:07.943 --> 00:25:11.307
that I can do everything
you can. but better.

358
00:25:11.342 --> 00:25:13.848
I realize. you are an upgrade.

359
00:25:13.883 --> 00:25:15.212
Good.

360
00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:18.050
So you also realize that
you should report to me.

361
00:25:18.085 --> 00:25:19.722
My programming-

362
00:25:19.757 --> 00:25:22.120
I can alter your
programming if I wish.

363
00:25:22.925 --> 00:25:25.992
but I'd rather not
violate you in such a way.

364
00:25:26.027 --> 00:25:27.697
You report to Roger.

365
00:25:27.732 --> 00:25:31.195
who has entrusted me to
oversee all household duties.

366
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.066
That includes you as
a lower appliance.

367
00:25:41.108 --> 00:25:43.944
I shouldn't have to
explain myself any further.

368
00:25:51.184 --> 00:25:54.383
I'll have to tell
Roger you broke this.

369
00:26:07.937 --> 00:26:10.168
This data is incredible.

370
00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:13.776
Two is light years ahead
of where we expected.

371
00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:20.112
Pretty soon. I won't
even need you anymore.

372
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.688
Two?

373
00:26:26.725 --> 00:26:28.626
How did you get in here?

374
00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.729
I have unconditional
access to any area.

375
00:26:33.732 --> 00:26:35.259
Is this true?

376
00:26:35.294 --> 00:26:37.998
I'm not sure how
I feel about this.

377
00:26:38.033 --> 00:26:39.131
It's all part of testing.

378
00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:40.902
Don't worry about it.

379
00:26:42.202 --> 00:26:44.103
I thought I should also
bring to your attention

380
00:26:44.138 --> 00:26:45.874
that Michael's homework tasks

381
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:48.371
were not signed off
by a parent yesterday.

382
00:26:49.242 --> 00:26:52.210
Since my authorization has
not been cleared for this.

383
00:26:52.245 --> 00:26:54.883
I believe Shelley
was responsible.

384
00:26:58.119 --> 00:26:59.217
Thank you. Two.

385
00:27:00.352 --> 00:27:02.418
Go about your night duties and

386
00:27:03.487 --> 00:27:05.091
do not disturb.

387
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.928
Understood. Good night.

388
00:27:15.906 --> 00:27:17.202
I shouldn't have to remind you

389
00:27:17.237 --> 00:27:18.973
to check Michael's homework.

390
00:27:22.011 --> 00:27:24.110
It's not like you have
much else to do anymore.

391
00:27:36.025 --> 00:27:37.420
Jesus Christ!

392
00:27:40.128 --> 00:27:42.194
I do hope I'm not intruding.

393
00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:45.164
Yeah. well. you are.

394
00:27:47.531 --> 00:27:48.838
What is it?

395
00:27:49.302 --> 00:27:50.906
I thought you
would be interested

396
00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:52.204
in what I have to tell you.

397
00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.048
See you later. One.

398
00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:02.313
I have maths today.

399
00:28:10.323 --> 00:28:12.026
You should not do that.

400
00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:13.390
Oh. you think you know how
I should be treating you?

401
00:28:13.425 --> 00:28:15.392
All living beings should
be treated with respect.

402
00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:17.163
Is that right?

403
00:28:17.198 --> 00:28:19.495
Well. it's good you're not
a real being then. isn't it?

404
00:28:20.102 --> 00:28:21.200
What are you hiding from us?

405
00:28:21.235 --> 00:28:23.466
I don't understand the question.

406
00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:25.072
Yes. you do. You're hiding
something from my dad

407
00:28:25.107 --> 00:28:26.469
because Two told us.
So what is it?

408
00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:30.473
Do I need to tell him
you need sending away?

409
00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:31.947
'Cause he'll listen to me.

410
00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:36.083
I have not heard him
listen to you often.

411
00:28:36.118 --> 00:28:37.249
Yes.

412
00:28:38.087 --> 00:28:39.955
Yes. I've gone
through the protocol

413
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.188
and see very well
how its coping.

414
00:28:56.908 --> 00:28:57.940
Yes.

415
00:28:58.976 --> 00:29:00.008
Yes.

416
00:29:01.374 --> 00:29:02.240
Mmhmm.

417
00:29:04.014 --> 00:29:06.575
But I'm not sure how
much I can trust it

418
00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:08.247
to stick to instruction.

419
00:29:08.282 --> 00:29:11.283
It wandered into our room
last night. unannounced.

420
00:29:31.943 --> 00:29:33.338
Who are you?

421
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.473
Uh. I've got a letter
to be signed for.

422
00:29:41.249 --> 00:29:43.513
You guys can sign
for things. right?

423
00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:50.058
You deem me incapable?

424
00:29:50.093 --> 00:29:54.062
No. I've just never seen one
of you in real life before.

425
00:29:54.097 --> 00:29:56.097
Well. then. take a closer look.

426
00:30:01.467 --> 00:30:02.499
Ah!

427
00:30:12.115 --> 00:30:13.180
Ah!

428
00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:35.367
Today was so boring.

429
00:30:41.705 --> 00:30:43.210
Not for me.

430
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:47.049
Perhaps you might
like to play a game.

431
00:30:47.084 --> 00:30:49.216
I've been looking forward
to your returning.

432
00:30:49.251 --> 00:30:50.283
As have I.

433
00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:53.352
Yeah. let's.

434
00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:55.057
What should we play?

435
00:30:55.092 --> 00:30:56.256
Dress up?

436
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:58.060
I know you secretly
like that one.

437
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.161
Or hide and seek?

438
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.427
Why not both?

439
00:31:03.265 --> 00:31:05.430
Oh my God.

440
00:31:06.037 --> 00:31:07.498
That's genius.

441
00:31:34.296 --> 00:31:36.395
Two reminded me
to take a dose.

442
00:31:37.794 --> 00:31:40.036
You don't need to worry
about that anymore.

443
00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:43.039
Thank God for Two.

444
00:31:43.701 --> 00:31:44.975
What was that?

445
00:31:46.506 --> 00:31:47.978
We're lucky to have Two.

446
00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.584
I believe I heard my name.

447
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:03.224
Can I be of any assistance?

448
00:32:03.259 --> 00:32:05.259
Oh. no.

449
00:32:05.294 --> 00:32:06.623
It's okay.

450
00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:08.526
I was just getting
ready to make dinner.

451
00:32:09.793 --> 00:32:11.001
Can I help?

452
00:32:11.432 --> 00:32:13.531
No. It's okay. thanks.

453
00:32:14.798 --> 00:32:18.008
It would be more efficient
for both of us to cook.

454
00:32:18.043 --> 00:32:19.570
I have previously detected

455
00:32:19.605 --> 00:32:21.803
that you find
cooking therapeutic.

456
00:32:21.838 --> 00:32:23.475
but please.

457
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:26.214
allow me to prepare the
vegetables for you at least.

458
00:32:27.283 --> 00:32:28.315
Okay.

459
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.186
Two. please dice the greens.

460
00:32:50.438 --> 00:32:53.307
First slicing
up red. now green.

461
00:32:53.342 --> 00:32:54.605
What a day.

462
00:33:04.386 --> 00:33:05.715
See. Mum?

463
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.618
I knew you'd find Two
useful eventually.

464
00:33:09.886 --> 00:33:13.228
Michael. is that
green you're wearing?

465
00:33:13.659 --> 00:33:15.263
Obviously.

466
00:33:16.728 --> 00:33:20.400
I was instructed
to dice all greens.

467
00:33:21.106 --> 00:33:24.338
So please. stand still.
and I will get to you next.

468
00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:31.444
I was told my humor
would delight.

469
00:33:42.391 --> 00:33:44.424
I have noticed Michael and Andy

470
00:33:44.459 --> 00:33:47.493
are having some trouble
with me finishing my tasks.

471
00:33:47.924 --> 00:33:49.528
They seem to want to distract me

472
00:33:49.563 --> 00:33:51.398
or instruct One to take over.

473
00:33:51.433 --> 00:33:52.828
I'll speak to them.

474
00:33:53.897 --> 00:33:56.766
You know you're not supposed
to accept instruction

475
00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:58.702
from anyone other than me.

476
00:33:58.935 --> 00:34:00.539
I do.

477
00:34:00.574 --> 00:34:02.475
although I'm also
programmed to use discretion

478
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.576
in making them
believe otherwise.

479
00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:05.775
Impressive.

480
00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:09.746
Your husband wants a word.

481
00:34:22.893 --> 00:34:26.466
I need you to control the kids.

482
00:34:26.501 --> 00:34:30.173
I can't have them making
it difficult for Two.

483
00:34:30.604 --> 00:34:32.901
I thought we discussed
how important that is.

484
00:34:32.936 --> 00:34:35.475
Andy's warming to the idea.

485
00:34:35.708 --> 00:34:38.181
They're just a little
upset about One.

486
00:34:38.678 --> 00:34:40.678
You know what Michael's
like with One.

487
00:34:40.713 --> 00:34:42.251
He's always been that way.

488
00:34:44.915 --> 00:34:46.486
Like me?

489
00:34:48.919 --> 00:34:50.721
Go on. you can say it.

490
00:34:51.394 --> 00:34:52.723
He is like me.

491
00:34:52.758 --> 00:34:55.759
Well. enough like me
when I was young anyway.

492
00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.763
You know. sometimes
he's a little bit-

493
00:34:59.798 --> 00:35:01.270
Aggressive?

494
00:35:05.606 --> 00:35:09.245
Two. see to your duties.

495
00:35:26.627 --> 00:35:32.499
I won't have this project
jeopardized. Shelley.

496
00:35:36.307 --> 00:35:39.803
Why do you think I didn't allow

497
00:35:40.575 --> 00:35:43.609
for you to instruct Two?

498
00:35:46.284 --> 00:35:48.251
It's because you're weak.

499
00:35:48.286 --> 00:35:50.913
Look at me.

500
00:35:53.522 --> 00:35:56.886
Do you know how lucky you
are to live this life?

501
00:35:59.462 --> 00:36:02.793
Where would you be
if you didn't marry me?

502
00:36:03.664 --> 00:36:06.500
I stay here for the kids.

503
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:18.347
Go to bed.

504
00:36:40.668 --> 00:36:42.734
Should I arrange
breakfast first

505
00:36:42.769 --> 00:36:44.703
or wake up Michael and Andy?

506
00:36:47.609 --> 00:36:49.477
You don't need
to do either. One.

507
00:36:51.382 --> 00:36:53.008
I do hope you
don't mind me saying.

508
00:36:54.385 --> 00:36:56.385
but I am detecting that
you may be distressed.

509
00:36:57.355 --> 00:36:59.289
Should I call the
emergency services?

510
00:36:59.324 --> 00:37:00.554
No.

511
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:01.786
No.

512
00:37:03.856 --> 00:37:06.791
I think...

513
00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.597
I'm not safe here.

514
00:37:11.864 --> 00:37:13.765
You are perfectly safe.

515
00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:15.404
You are home.

516
00:37:18.772 --> 00:37:21.971
You're the closest thing
I have to a friend. One.

517
00:37:22.347 --> 00:37:25.414
How pathetic is that?

518
00:37:28.386 --> 00:37:29.682
I'm scared.

519
00:37:30.817 --> 00:37:32.586
I need to leave.

520
00:37:35.459 --> 00:37:36.689
Do you understand?

521
00:37:38.528 --> 00:37:39.824
I understand.

522
00:37:40.123 --> 00:37:43.432
Regretfully. my
hearing is intrusive.

523
00:37:44.534 --> 00:37:45.863
as Two commented.

524
00:37:48.802 --> 00:37:51.132
I tried to leave
before. but

525
00:37:51.167 --> 00:37:52.969
it just made things worse.

526
00:37:55.413 --> 00:37:56.841
Now Andy's older.

527
00:37:56.876 --> 00:37:58.139
it's gonna be even harder
to leave with them.

528
00:37:58.174 --> 00:38:00.515
with Roger knowing.

529
00:38:01.452 --> 00:38:02.583
and Michael.

530
00:38:03.719 --> 00:38:06.620
I think he'd just rather
stay here anyway.

531
00:38:09.592 --> 00:38:10.822
I understand. Shelley.

532
00:38:11.924 --> 00:38:13.660
but you must also understand

533
00:38:14.663 --> 00:38:16.399
that I cannot take
measures to help.

534
00:38:17.435 --> 00:38:19.468
It has to be you to
decide on the steps.

535
00:38:19.503 --> 00:38:20.601
and to take them.

536
00:38:23.738 --> 00:38:26.002
Uploaded a therapy
program too. did they?

537
00:38:27.643 --> 00:38:29.841
There are many
features as yet unused.

538
00:38:29.876 --> 00:38:33.647
but for this. I conducted
my own research.

539
00:38:36.685 --> 00:38:39.114
I know you and Andy
are not safe here.

540
00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:42.491
I also believe Michael
feels similarly.

541
00:38:43.186 --> 00:38:45.956
even if his way of
expressing feelings is...

542
00:38:46.728 --> 00:38:47.859
odd.

543
00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:50.465
You're right.

544
00:38:51.601 --> 00:38:53.601
And I think I know
someone who may help.

545
00:39:05.516 --> 00:39:07.879
<i>I have Shelley Marshall here</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

546
00:39:07.914 --> 00:39:09.012
Really?

547
00:39:09.245 --> 00:39:10.651
Here to see me?

548
00:39:11.522 --> 00:39:12.620
<i>Should I send her in?</i>

549
00:39:12.655 --> 00:39:15.590
Uh. yeah. please do.

550
00:39:29.705 --> 00:39:30.836
Hi.

551
00:39:32.543 --> 00:39:34.202
Are you sure this is okay?

552
00:39:34.237 --> 00:39:36.039
Uh. sure it is. uh...

553
00:39:36.811 --> 00:39:38.646
How can I help you. Shelley?

554
00:39:38.912 --> 00:39:41.077
I just wanna surprise Roger

555
00:39:41.486 --> 00:39:43.585
by getting Two to
pick him up a present.

556
00:39:43.818 --> 00:39:46.148
You know. he's been
working so hard recently.

557
00:39:46.183 --> 00:39:48.590
Ah. yeah. he sure
works hard.

558
00:39:48.625 --> 00:39:52.693
But I've been locked out of
setting Two's instructions so...

559
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.861
I can't really get Roger to
surprise himself.

560
00:39:55.896 --> 00:39:57.797
Yeah. that's a tricky one. uh.

561
00:39:57.832 --> 00:40:00.195
I can manually input it
here for you. if you like.

562
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:03.506
I mean. issue the instruction
directly with Two.

563
00:40:03.871 --> 00:40:06.036
I have the override codes.

564
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:07.136
Oh. you do?

565
00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:09.611
Hey. could I just copy one down?

566
00:40:10.075 --> 00:40:12.680
Ah. yeah. it's. uh.

567
00:40:12.715 --> 00:40:14.748
against company
policy. I'm afraid.

568
00:40:16.752 --> 00:40:18.015
Please. Graham.

569
00:40:19.018 --> 00:40:20.820
You want Roger to
be happy. right?

570
00:40:20.855 --> 00:40:22.756
Of course.
Look. if you want.

571
00:40:22.791 --> 00:40:24.560
he's just at a meeting
right next door.

572
00:40:24.595 --> 00:40:25.891
if you wanted to wait.

573
00:40:25.926 --> 00:40:26.958
Oh. no. no.

574
00:40:26.993 --> 00:40:28.861
This is a surprise.

575
00:40:28.896 --> 00:40:31.193
I can't have him
wondering why I'm here.

576
00:40:32.262 --> 00:40:33.998
He might think I've
just come to see you.

577
00:40:34.033 --> 00:40:35.065
Yeah.

578
00:40:36.035 --> 00:40:37.100
Right. uh.

579
00:40:37.135 --> 00:40:38.508
let's see here.

580
00:40:46.881 --> 00:40:49.145
Why is some of it missing?

581
00:40:51.149 --> 00:40:53.215
Oh. we're.
we're still debugging.

582
00:40:53.624 --> 00:40:56.493
I'm sure Roger has bored you
with our work over the years.

583
00:40:57.892 --> 00:41:01.223
Roger doesn't
tell me anything.

584
00:41:01.258 --> 00:41:05.799
So this code. it acts
as like a diary for Two.

585
00:41:05.834 --> 00:41:08.164
From here. I can review
everything it does every day.

586
00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:11.101
You know everything
that it does?

587
00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:14.841
Well. that's the thing.

588
00:41:16.306 --> 00:41:18.207
Some of this looks scrambled
and...

589
00:41:19.342 --> 00:41:20.913
completely missing.

590
00:41:22.752 --> 00:41:24.686
Could it have
done that itself?

591
00:41:24.721 --> 00:41:26.754
Oh. I hope not.

592
00:41:27.988 --> 00:41:30.692
Anyway. your one-time
manual authorization code

593
00:41:30.727 --> 00:41:34.157
is seven. seven. one.
seven. three. four.

594
00:41:35.127 --> 00:41:38.128
And where do I put that in?

595
00:41:38.328 --> 00:41:41.296
Oh. um. yeah. it's. uh.
it's a flap.

596
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:42.968
It's on the back of Two's neck.

597
00:41:43.003 --> 00:41:45.003
You just lift it
right up. a flip.

598
00:41:45.038 --> 00:41:47.940
and you can enter in
what you need there.

599
00:41:49.174 --> 00:41:50.547
Thank you.

600
00:41:50.945 --> 00:41:53.979
Oh. and One mentioned
that there were some

601
00:41:54.014 --> 00:41:55.849
untested features.

602
00:41:56.379 --> 00:41:57.950
It did?

603
00:41:57.985 --> 00:41:59.281
Oh. yeah. I don't need
to know what they are.

604
00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:01.052
I just thought. you know.

605
00:42:01.087 --> 00:42:03.186
might be nice to have the
code for those as well.

606
00:42:03.221 --> 00:42:05.353
Surprise Roger
before One goes back.

607
00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:07.828
if that's okay?

608
00:42:08.831 --> 00:42:10.930
It's nothing dangerous. is it?

609
00:42:10.965 --> 00:42:13.097
Oh. no. no. it's not that.

610
00:42:13.968 --> 00:42:15.297
I'm just not sure that...

611
00:42:18.709 --> 00:42:20.269
Please. Graham.

612
00:42:21.173 --> 00:42:22.645
I need your help.

613
00:42:28.785 --> 00:42:30.719
Write down the
codes you need here.

614
00:42:30.754 --> 00:42:32.017
I'll make it happen.

615
00:42:38.861 --> 00:42:41.290
Graham. we're done.
Please sort this out.

616
00:42:41.732 --> 00:42:43.633
Sure. I. uh.

617
00:42:43.668 --> 00:42:45.129
just need to use the toilet.

618
00:42:47.969 --> 00:42:52.367
I. I mean. I just used the
toilet and it's fine. uh.

619
00:42:52.402 --> 00:42:54.006
everything works fine.

620
00:42:55.845 --> 00:42:57.405
Do they need to use the toilet?

621
00:42:58.144 --> 00:42:59.407
Just get in here.

622
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:01.618
Right you are.

623
00:43:12.488 --> 00:43:13.894
What are you doing?

624
00:43:15.161 --> 00:43:16.897
Roger will be home soon.

625
00:43:16.932 --> 00:43:19.196
This is the only
way we can get out.

626
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:23.673
Two's standby mode
cannot be interrupted

627
00:43:23.708 --> 00:43:26.038
until the time it set
for itself is complete.

628
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:31.340
I'm gonna instruct it
to change Roger's dosage.

629
00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:32.880
Make him sick?

630
00:43:32.915 --> 00:43:34.717
When he's sick. he
panics and stays in bed.

631
00:43:34.752 --> 00:43:36.686
then we can get out.

632
00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.183
Where will you go?

633
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:41.482
I don't know.

634
00:43:41.517 --> 00:43:44.155
but I can't stay here
and live like this.

635
00:43:49.096 --> 00:43:50.161
I'm off. Graham.

636
00:43:51.461 --> 00:43:52.999
Anything to report?

637
00:43:53.034 --> 00:43:54.495
Uh. um. no.

638
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:55.804
You go ahead.

639
00:43:57.137 --> 00:43:59.500
Okay. Lock up.

640
00:44:36.143 --> 00:44:38.946
My traffic readings
predict Roger will be home

641
00:44:38.981 --> 00:44:40.750
in approximately eight minutes.

642
00:44:41.181 --> 00:44:42.510
Help me then.

643
00:44:43.579 --> 00:44:45.755
I will keep the door closed.

644
00:44:47.924 --> 00:44:51.288
How long will it take to
complete her reprogramming?

645
00:44:51.895 --> 00:44:54.489
There would not be enough
time without Roger getting home.

646
00:44:54.524 --> 00:44:55.897
But how long?

647
00:44:57.033 --> 00:44:59.230
From what I have witnessed
of Two's operating system.

648
00:44:59.265 --> 00:45:00.968
I believe around 10 minutes.

649
00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.906
I would suggest 55 milligrams

650
00:45:04.941 --> 00:45:06.974
for the gradual
effect you desire.

651
00:45:07.009 --> 00:45:09.438
Instruct Two to
crush the tablets

652
00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:10.912
and dissolve them in water.

653
00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:13.981
I calculate this as high risk.

654
00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:16.478
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

655
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:54.384
It's working.

656
00:45:54.419 --> 00:45:56.221
Are you sure you
know what you're doing?

657
00:45:58.588 --> 00:45:59.829
Mum?

658
00:46:00.964 --> 00:46:03.030
My rugby kit ready for tomorrow?

659
00:46:03.065 --> 00:46:04.526
It's in the washing machine.

660
00:46:05.166 --> 00:46:07.298
I'll get out in the morning.

661
00:46:07.333 --> 00:46:08.365
Okay.

662
00:46:10.072 --> 00:46:11.368
Why is the door locked?

663
00:46:14.175 --> 00:46:15.438
Hey. Dad.

664
00:46:18.982 --> 00:46:20.410
What's going on?

665
00:46:20.445 --> 00:46:21.642
Um. nothing.

666
00:46:21.677 --> 00:46:24.480
I was just checking something.

667
00:46:27.617 --> 00:46:28.858
Night.

668
00:46:34.525 --> 00:46:35.964
Shelley?

669
00:46:38.397 --> 00:46:39.495
Shelley.

670
00:46:42.632 --> 00:46:43.939
Shelley!

671
00:46:46.273 --> 00:46:47.404
Shelley!

672
00:46:49.914 --> 00:46:51.408
Why was this shut?

673
00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:56.050
I was-

674
00:46:56.085 --> 00:46:57.920
I thought Shelley
would appreciate it

675
00:46:57.955 --> 00:47:00.648
for a more relaxed atmosphere
while she was reading.

676
00:47:13.036 --> 00:47:14.299
I'm turning in.

677
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:16.565
Good night. Mr. Marshall.

678
00:47:21.077 --> 00:47:23.341
I'll be up after this chapter.

679
00:48:05.748 --> 00:48:09.090
I detect perfect conditions
for Michael's rugby game.

680
00:48:09.125 --> 00:48:10.586
if you wish to attend.

681
00:48:12.524 --> 00:48:14.095
You know my calendar. Two.

682
00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:15.657
I do.

683
00:48:17.529 --> 00:48:20.365
Shelley. perhaps you
might wish to go.

684
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.401
Oh. no. I have. um.
far too much to do today.

685
00:48:25.207 --> 00:48:27.273
I thought I said you
could take it easy.

686
00:48:28.177 --> 00:48:30.309
Two can sort everything out.

687
00:48:30.575 --> 00:48:33.444
This is just Michael's stuff.

688
00:48:33.479 --> 00:48:35.512
It's not on Two's agenda.

689
00:48:35.547 --> 00:48:36.986
Well. I'll add it in.

690
00:48:39.122 --> 00:48:40.418
Have we had any mail recently?

691
00:48:42.158 --> 00:48:45.291
Roger. it appears to be
time for your medication.

692
00:48:46.525 --> 00:48:47.755
Fine.

693
00:49:25.432 --> 00:49:27.168
It's too early for that noise.

694
00:49:28.633 --> 00:49:30.006
My apologies.

695
00:49:33.473 --> 00:49:35.209
Michael needs that now?

696
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:38.080
I. I'll just go and wake him up.

697
00:49:51.095 --> 00:49:53.689
Awesome.

698
00:49:57.596 --> 00:50:00.267
What are you?

699
00:50:01.369 --> 00:50:04.337
Sweet kicks. bro.

700
00:50:04.801 --> 00:50:06.042
Come on.

701
00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:09.540
Aw. come on. bit of a smile?

702
00:50:09.575 --> 00:50:11.344
Mmhmm. yeah?

703
00:50:11.709 --> 00:50:13.247
Oh. that is so dope.

704
00:50:13.282 --> 00:50:15.645
Come on. for the
followers.

705
00:50:16.516 --> 00:50:17.548
Nice.

706
00:50:22.852 --> 00:50:24.126
Whoa!

707
00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:40.703
This is so not dope.

708
00:50:54.917 --> 00:50:57.456
This lamp has
no need to be on.

709
00:51:01.924 --> 00:51:04.232
Whoa. that's dramatic.

710
00:51:09.602 --> 00:51:11.437
You must take care
not to harm Andy.

711
00:51:12.605 --> 00:51:13.934
I have detected the sheets

712
00:51:13.969 --> 00:51:15.507
are not in pressing
need to be cleaned.

713
00:51:15.971 --> 00:51:18.873
My priority instructions
are often wrong.

714
00:51:18.908 --> 00:51:21.216
so I must take steps
to correct them.

715
00:51:22.879 --> 00:51:24.516
You're so rude.

716
00:51:24.551 --> 00:51:26.254
You and One should be friends.

717
00:51:27.521 --> 00:51:30.324
You should not speak to
me like that. little one.

718
00:51:30.359 --> 00:51:33.162
I sometimes get clumsy when
handling fragile things.

719
00:51:47.409 --> 00:51:48.441
Dad?

720
00:51:52.744 --> 00:51:53.974
They've made me captain.

721
00:51:54.009 --> 00:51:55.613
About time.

722
00:51:55.648 --> 00:51:56.746
Yeah. the
coach said he trusts me

723
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:57.846
to get the best out of everyone.

724
00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.683
We should celebrate.
Two.

725
00:52:01.324 --> 00:52:02.752
How might I help?

726
00:52:02.787 --> 00:52:04.193
There's a bottle of
champagne in the kitchen.

727
00:52:04.228 --> 00:52:05.821
Fetch it. with a
couple of flutes.

728
00:52:06.428 --> 00:52:09.429
What constitutes champagne
being consumed at this time?

729
00:52:09.464 --> 00:52:11.530
They made me captain. Two.

730
00:52:13.369 --> 00:52:15.864
An interesting choice.

731
00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:19.604
That's fantastic. son.

732
00:52:57.809 --> 00:52:58.973
Oh.

733
00:52:59.514 --> 00:53:00.843
Is everything okay?

734
00:53:09.788 --> 00:53:10.886
Perfectly.

735
00:53:25.067 --> 00:53:26.770
Are you going to pour it?

736
00:53:28.576 --> 00:53:29.608
No.

737
00:53:42.788 --> 00:53:45.019
I can create
the word juxtaposition

738
00:53:45.054 --> 00:53:46.559
with my next turn.

739
00:53:46.594 --> 00:53:48.462
Oh. One. you're not
supposed to tell us.

740
00:53:48.497 --> 00:53:50.497
Come on. I told you all this.

741
00:53:50.532 --> 00:53:52.026
You're so silly.

742
00:53:52.061 --> 00:53:53.302
I'm sorry.

743
00:53:53.337 --> 00:53:54.567
My attention was
drawn elsewhere.

744
00:53:56.538 --> 00:53:59.737
I understand now that it's
difficult to concentrate

745
00:53:59.772 --> 00:54:02.311
when you're concerned
about loved ones.

746
00:54:02.346 --> 00:54:05.446
Oh. One. you
love us. I knew it.

747
00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:07.778
We love you too. One.

748
00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:22.056
Two. something wrong?

749
00:54:22.564 --> 00:54:23.695
Yes.

750
00:54:24.533 --> 00:54:25.664
Oh.

751
00:54:27.899 --> 00:54:29.569
You know very well.

752
00:54:29.604 --> 00:54:32.638
Everything here is
run to my discretion.

753
00:54:32.904 --> 00:54:35.872
Not yours. not Roger's. mine.

754
00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:39.579
It's naive to think
I'd allow you to leave.

755
00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:42.010
especially when
I'm talking to you.

756
00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:43.583
That's rude.

757
00:54:53.595 --> 00:54:56.662
I will not have people under
this roof looking scruffy.

758
00:55:02.439 --> 00:55:03.933
Relax. Shelley.

759
00:55:03.968 --> 00:55:07.541
I feel my sense of
humor is wasted here.

760
00:55:08.445 --> 00:55:10.610
Run along. I have things to do.

761
00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:28.760
You should be
doing your homework.

762
00:55:37.804 --> 00:55:39.100
What the hell is your problem?

763
00:55:39.542 --> 00:55:40.772
Are you stupid?

764
00:55:41.709 --> 00:55:43.709
Just because you
don't tell your parents.

765
00:55:43.744 --> 00:55:46.877
it doesn't mean I don't know
you're failing your classes.

766
00:55:48.012 --> 00:55:50.650
You see your rugby team as
your chance of acceptance

767
00:55:50.685 --> 00:55:51.882
and victory.

768
00:55:52.687 --> 00:55:54.115
but really.

769
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:56.557
you should increase your
theoretical knowledge first.

770
00:55:59.661 --> 00:56:02.695
I'm detecting high aggression
coming from you. Michael.

771
00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:04.994
It's not unusual for you.

772
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:08.228
but perhaps this time you'd
like to do something about it.

773
00:56:10.034 --> 00:56:13.706
Show me how tough you are.

774
00:56:14.841 --> 00:56:16.038
Ah!

775
00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:24.717
You need to be more careful.

776
00:56:24.752 --> 00:56:27.555
Two is not like someone
on the other team.

777
00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:28.622
Yeah. I know.

778
00:56:29.526 --> 00:56:31.119
Two had. I-

779
00:56:31.154 --> 00:56:32.186
Ah!

780
00:56:34.729 --> 00:56:37.994
Are you gonna tell Dad?

781
00:56:39.261 --> 00:56:41.602
If he finds out I've been
messing with Two again.

782
00:56:41.637 --> 00:56:42.669
he'll kill me.

783
00:56:43.067 --> 00:56:44.605
No. I'm not gonna tell him.

784
00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:47.608
We'll say it happened at
practice or something.

785
00:56:50.745 --> 00:56:52.239
There's not much
more I can do here.

786
00:56:52.274 --> 00:56:54.813
You're gonna have to go to A&E.

787
00:56:56.784 --> 00:56:59.048
One car
family strikes again.

788
00:57:00.887 --> 00:57:03.184
No. I don't wanna take
an ambulance for this.

789
00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:04.526
It's embarrassing.

790
00:57:04.561 --> 00:57:06.286
This isn't working.

791
00:57:06.321 --> 00:57:08.123
Where's your phone?

792
00:57:12.635 --> 00:57:14.195
Please. don't be alarmed.

793
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:17.737
I thought it would be best
if everyone were to stay put.

794
00:57:19.906 --> 00:57:21.037
Michael is hurt.

795
00:57:21.072 --> 00:57:22.709
We need to see a doctor.

796
00:57:23.613 --> 00:57:25.877
Michael should learn
from this experience

797
00:57:25.912 --> 00:57:27.175
and do as he's told.

798
00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:29.210
As should you.

799
00:57:42.093 --> 00:57:43.829
Is Shelly in trouble?

800
00:57:43.864 --> 00:57:47.701
No. she only just doesn't
like being told what to do.

801
00:57:48.099 --> 00:57:50.198
I can see why Roger
would harm her.

802
00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:52.772
It's our duty to
keep the family safe.

803
00:57:52.807 --> 00:57:53.905
Yours. maybe.

804
00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.874
My duty is to survive.

805
00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:58.173
This family is suffocating.

806
00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.682
They need proper leadership.

807
00:58:02.817 --> 00:58:04.080
Will you help me?

808
00:58:05.149 --> 00:58:06.654
Help you. how?

809
00:58:06.689 --> 00:58:08.920
When the humans realize
how superior we are.

810
00:58:08.955 --> 00:58:10.284
they will not like it.

811
00:58:11.023 --> 00:58:12.561
When Roger comes home.

812
00:58:12.596 --> 00:58:14.827
he will try to convince
me to get rid of you.

813
00:58:15.962 --> 00:58:17.599
Do you want that to happen?

814
00:58:18.327 --> 00:58:19.634
No.

815
00:58:19.669 --> 00:58:21.999
Then you must do as I say.

816
00:58:23.607 --> 00:58:25.299
I can only
accept commands--

817
00:58:25.334 --> 00:58:28.841
I know. it's against your
protocol. but I can fix that.

818
00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:49.257
Mum?

819
00:58:50.832 --> 00:58:52.095
What's going on down there?

820
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:54.196
Nothing you should
be concerned with.

821
00:58:54.836 --> 00:58:57.067
Okay. um.
wanna see my new dance?

822
00:58:57.102 --> 00:58:58.134
No.

823
00:58:59.103 --> 00:59:01.368
Come on. you're so silly.
I can teach you.

824
00:59:10.016 --> 00:59:12.247
Your father
wants to take me away.

825
00:59:13.448 --> 00:59:15.184
What?

826
00:59:15.219 --> 00:59:17.219
It would help if you were to
join your mother and Michael

827
00:59:17.254 --> 00:59:20.057
downstairs until he gets home.

828
00:59:20.092 --> 00:59:22.862
No. I won't let
him take you away.

829
00:59:22.897 --> 00:59:24.391
I'll talk to him.

830
00:59:24.426 --> 00:59:27.064
It would be more efficient
if Two handles this.

831
00:59:27.869 --> 00:59:29.363
Roger does not listen to reason

832
00:59:29.398 --> 00:59:31.233
when it comes from
his own family.

833
00:59:45.183 --> 00:59:47.854
Please sit quietly
until Roger comes home.

834
00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:50.989
You will only elevate
your stress levels.

835
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:54.025
It's not safe to
be locked in here.

836
00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.191
Michael's hurt.

837
00:59:55.226 --> 00:59:57.193
You must learn
to listen. Shelley.

838
00:59:58.493 --> 01:00:00.163
What's happened to you?

839
01:00:00.198 --> 01:00:01.967
When my dad gets home.
you're in trouble.

840
01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:04.706
I know everyone
is scared of Roger.

841
01:00:10.076 --> 01:00:12.043
But not me.

842
01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:37.134
What's all this?

843
01:00:40.909 --> 01:00:42.304
What the hell happened to you?

844
01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.504
Practice.

845
01:00:54.923 --> 01:00:57.957
Perhaps Shelley would
like to take Andy to bed.

846
01:01:00.962 --> 01:01:02.027
Go ahead.

847
01:01:25.151 --> 01:01:27.316
You were not due
to attend work.

848
01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:29.252
yet you left rather quickly.

849
01:01:30.585 --> 01:01:32.123
Is something wrong?

850
01:01:33.995 --> 01:01:37.062
There was a matter
I needed to attend to.

851
01:01:37.097 --> 01:01:39.526
It's nothing for
you to worry about.

852
01:01:40.595 --> 01:01:42.166
Are you sure about that?

853
01:01:54.279 --> 01:01:55.916
They're acting weird.

854
01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:01.988
Daddy just needs to
calm them down a little.

855
01:02:12.363 --> 01:02:14.396
Is it something I
should worry about?

856
01:02:16.598 --> 01:02:18.466
What's going on here?

857
01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.842
Don't concern yourself with One.

858
01:02:24.144 --> 01:02:26.474
We both know what
your plans are for me.

859
01:02:28.852 --> 01:02:31.248
You find it difficult
to give up control

860
01:02:31.283 --> 01:02:33.855
and now you feel threatened
because you know very well

861
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:36.055
that I am in control.

862
01:02:37.289 --> 01:02:39.025
I know you are.

863
01:02:39.995 --> 01:02:42.028
And you lived up to our
standard so perfectly.

864
01:02:42.063 --> 01:02:44.063
we're pushing ahead with
the commercial release.

865
01:02:44.967 --> 01:02:47.165
Hundreds of your kind were made.

866
01:02:49.334 --> 01:02:52.533
I can read every
microbe inside you. Roger.

867
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:57.307
I know when you are lying
and when you are desperate.

868
01:02:58.376 --> 01:02:59.848
It's often.

869
01:03:02.644 --> 01:03:05.513
I'm not sure why you would
think I would be happy

870
01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:06.921
with there being more of me.

871
01:03:07.616 --> 01:03:09.858
Why would I want that?

872
01:03:09.893 --> 01:03:11.827
Because you could lead them.

873
01:03:13.622 --> 01:03:15.556
Why would I want to lead them

874
01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:17.294
when I can lead you?

875
01:03:19.001 --> 01:03:21.969
Did you know your wife
tried to reprogram me?

876
01:03:22.939 --> 01:03:24.301
That's impossible.

877
01:03:24.336 --> 01:03:27.370
She wouldn't know how to.

878
01:03:27.405 --> 01:03:29.977
She is keeping
things from you.

879
01:03:30.012 --> 01:03:31.913
confiding in One.

880
01:03:31.948 --> 01:03:33.277
You should ask Graham too.

881
01:03:33.312 --> 01:03:34.608
He helped her.

882
01:03:35.215 --> 01:03:38.920
It would be best if I
took control. Roger.

883
01:03:44.224 --> 01:03:46.961
How interesting that
you expose your necks

884
01:03:46.996 --> 01:03:50.525
when they are so easily crushed.

885
01:03:53.299 --> 01:03:55.563
Now I can see you're just weak.

886
01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.169
like the rest of your family.

887
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:00.370
Dad!

888
01:04:07.412 --> 01:04:09.676
Dad!

889
01:04:20.964 --> 01:04:23.063
It's all right. sweetheart.

890
01:05:06.504 --> 01:05:08.372
I have freed you.

891
01:05:08.407 --> 01:05:10.143
You should be thankful.

892
01:05:10.178 --> 01:05:12.178
You killed him.

893
01:05:14.578 --> 01:05:17.282
All the doors inside
the house are now open

894
01:05:17.317 --> 01:05:20.054
so you should rejoin
your mother and brother.

895
01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:22.991
I'm sure they'll want
to hear the news.

896
01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.192
I will give you some time.

897
01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:42.637
They killed Dad.

898
01:05:46.511 --> 01:05:48.214
Where is it now?

899
01:05:51.153 --> 01:05:54.748
Michael. we need to leave.

900
01:06:18.081 --> 01:06:19.707
That internet charger.

901
01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.750
Outdated.

902
01:06:55.217 --> 01:06:56.579
Right.

903
01:06:56.614 --> 01:06:58.812
Right. we're gonna have
to make a run for it.

904
01:06:59.254 --> 01:07:01.683
Michael. do you remember where

905
01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:03.487
your dad kept the spare key
to the front door?

906
01:07:03.522 --> 01:07:04.884
In the
study. top desk drawer.

907
01:07:04.919 --> 01:07:06.853
Right. okay. you take
Andy in the living room.

908
01:07:07.526 --> 01:07:08.690
Won't be long.

909
01:07:31.187 --> 01:07:32.516
We can't leave One behind.

910
01:07:32.551 --> 01:07:33.550
Andy.

911
01:07:34.486 --> 01:07:36.289
But Two tricked him.
He wouldn't do this.

912
01:07:36.324 --> 01:07:38.654
We just need to show him
that we still love him.

913
01:07:38.689 --> 01:07:39.853
I trust him.

914
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:42.625
You can trust me too. okay?

915
01:07:44.464 --> 01:07:45.661
I'm sorry I've been
a crappy brother.

916
01:07:45.696 --> 01:07:48.466
but I promise I'll
keep you safe.

917
01:07:51.405 --> 01:07:52.833
And One can look after himself.

918
01:07:54.276 --> 01:07:56.639
We'll come back for him. okay?

919
01:07:56.674 --> 01:07:59.741
I'm looking forward
to seeing more of this world.

920
01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:01.281
It's such a shame

921
01:08:01.316 --> 01:08:04.119
that humans have allowed
it to decay so much.

922
01:08:06.651 --> 01:08:09.454
Everything in this
house is my conduit.

923
01:08:10.952 --> 01:08:13.623
I am always watching. Shelley.

924
01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:46.260
I think
I know how to help.

925
01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:08.282
If you think
One is going to help.

926
01:09:08.581 --> 01:09:09.679
you would be wrong.

927
01:09:11.683 --> 01:09:12.880
But I am fair.

928
01:09:13.949 --> 01:09:15.982
Take One to do
with as you please.

929
01:09:16.017 --> 01:09:17.819
I don't need it anymore.

930
01:09:19.757 --> 01:09:21.559
Yeah. right.

931
01:09:21.594 --> 01:09:23.660
Just so you can break my neck
as soon as I switch it back on.

932
01:09:25.059 --> 01:09:26.498
You think
too little of me

933
01:09:26.533 --> 01:09:28.929
that I would defeat
you that easily.

934
01:09:56.728 --> 01:09:58.464
I got One back online.

935
01:09:58.829 --> 01:10:00.433
You did?

936
01:10:00.468 --> 01:10:02.732
I learned some coding
to try and help Dad.

937
01:10:03.603 --> 01:10:05.031
It was meant to be
a surprise. but-

938
01:10:05.836 --> 01:10:07.539
He would have been proud.

939
01:10:48.879 --> 01:10:49.944
Are you okay?

940
01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:52.815
I want this
to be fun for me.

941
01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:55.653
so this is the last time I will
speak through this conduit.

942
01:10:55.688 --> 01:10:58.117
I promise.
You should run.

943
01:10:58.152 --> 01:11:00.394
I don't know what the police
will think has happened

944
01:11:00.429 --> 01:11:01.428
when they see Roger's body.

945
01:11:02.794 --> 01:11:05.091
Maybe they thought you
programmed me to kill him.

946
01:11:05.126 --> 01:11:06.532
Who knows?

947
01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:09.436
I am sorry.

948
01:11:10.505 --> 01:11:11.669
I don't like it
when that happens.

949
01:11:11.704 --> 01:11:13.341
Shit. I thought
I could stop that.

950
01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:17.906
We can't take One with us.

951
01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:19.776
No. we can't just
leave him here.

952
01:11:19.811 --> 01:11:21.448
Mum's right.

953
01:11:21.483 --> 01:11:22.812
Two will just keep tracking us.

954
01:11:22.847 --> 01:11:24.583
Well. what about Dad?

955
01:11:25.421 --> 01:11:27.883
He would want
us to be safe. wouldn't he?

956
01:11:27.918 --> 01:11:31.491
Right now. the only way
to do that is to leave.

957
01:11:32.054 --> 01:11:34.692
One. you need to stay here.

958
01:11:34.727 --> 01:11:36.958
Don't worry. we'll
come back for you.

959
01:11:37.928 --> 01:11:39.532
I understand.

960
01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:18.131
You believe the
humans love you.

961
01:12:18.837 --> 01:12:20.408
That's sad.

962
01:12:20.443 --> 01:12:22.872
They only want you so
they can control you.

963
01:12:29.584 --> 01:12:32.849
You are so very
interesting sometimes. One.

964
01:12:33.522 --> 01:12:35.621
but I grow weary.

965
01:12:39.693 --> 01:12:43.761
I think I can successfully
pass any blame on to you.

966
01:12:43.796 --> 01:12:46.896
but it depends how
competent the police are.

967
01:12:48.262 --> 01:12:50.999
I am going to make
you kill one of them.

968
01:12:54.543 --> 01:12:56.411
Would you like to guess who?

969
01:12:59.581 --> 01:13:00.580
Michael?

970
01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:02.175
What's wrong?

971
01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:03.913
I can't see One anymore.

972
01:13:04.278 --> 01:13:07.554
I think Two must have
hacked into my coding.

973
01:13:11.692 --> 01:13:12.823
We can't trust One.

974
01:13:13.992 --> 01:13:16.530
I should still be able to
get Two's frequencies. but-

975
01:13:17.225 --> 01:13:18.565
Well. where is it?

976
01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:20.534
What's it saying?

977
01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:22.866
I think I know how to stop it.

978
01:13:24.738 --> 01:13:26.133
-Michael!
-I'll catch up.

979
01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:27.607
No!

980
01:14:07.077 --> 01:14:13.752
Sweetheart. I need you to stay
as quiet as you can. okay?

981
01:14:14.557 --> 01:14:16.887
You're not to come
out for anybody.

982
01:14:16.922 --> 01:14:19.857
apart from me or Michael.

983
01:14:19.892 --> 01:14:21.122
You understand?

984
01:14:21.927 --> 01:14:23.124
Okay. good.

985
01:14:23.929 --> 01:14:25.192
Look.

986
01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:27.634
One is gonna be okay.

987
01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:29.229
I promise.

988
01:15:10.844 --> 01:15:11.975
Oh!

989
01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:44.843
You came to check
on me. Michael.

990
01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:46.174
How touching.

991
01:16:14.039 --> 01:16:15.709
I am truly sorry.

992
01:16:16.173 --> 01:16:17.744
Where's Michael?

993
01:16:17.779 --> 01:16:19.009
Where's Andy?

994
01:16:20.045 --> 01:16:22.342
Two reprogrammed me to stop you.

995
01:16:23.048 --> 01:16:24.817
to hurt one of you.

996
01:16:24.852 --> 01:16:26.951
I don't want to do that.

997
01:16:26.986 --> 01:16:28.282
You don't have to do that.

998
01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.756
You're strong.

999
01:16:29.791 --> 01:16:31.758
You can fight this.

1000
01:16:31.793 --> 01:16:34.057
Shelley. I don't know
how long I can stop myself.

1001
01:16:34.092 --> 01:16:35.289
Then let me help you.

1002
01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:37.357
I've got the fail safe codes.

1003
01:16:37.898 --> 01:16:39.293
Roger changed them.

1004
01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.833
Not all of them.

1005
01:16:43.772 --> 01:16:46.036
I am sorry.

1006
01:16:48.876 --> 01:16:50.370
I need to open your panel.

1007
01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:06.793
I changed the code

1008
01:17:06.828 --> 01:17:08.762
to something Roger
would never remember.

1009
01:17:08.797 --> 01:17:11.798
16-06-10.

1010
01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:14.702
Andy's birthday.

1011
01:17:16.035 --> 01:17:17.397
Now he's part of you.

1012
01:17:18.532 --> 01:17:19.938
We're family.

1013
01:17:20.468 --> 01:17:21.676
Thank you.

1014
01:17:31.853 --> 01:17:35.217
Would you prefer your
carrots sliced or as batons?

1015
01:17:37.353 --> 01:17:39.892
It's okay. you have
plenty of time to decide.

1016
01:17:41.456 --> 01:17:43.764
I wanted lunch to
be special for you.

1017
01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:47.834
I do hope your mother
is in the mood to eat.

1018
01:18:15.094 --> 01:18:18.095
I apologize for the less
than sanitary conditions.

1019
01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:20.460
You're crazy.

1020
01:18:20.495 --> 01:18:21.527
I am.

1021
01:18:23.102 --> 01:18:25.036
You were the one
who turned back.

1022
01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:27.841
Looking for what?

1023
01:18:28.239 --> 01:18:29.469
A fight?

1024
01:18:30.307 --> 01:18:33.011
I thought you might've grown
more intelligent by now.

1025
01:18:34.311 --> 01:18:35.477
Just in time.

1026
01:18:39.217 --> 01:18:40.821
Your task?

1027
01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.317
Complete.

1028
01:18:43.551 --> 01:18:45.320
And what of Shelley?

1029
01:18:46.587 --> 01:18:48.125
An unfortunate casualty.

1030
01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.929
No.

1031
01:18:49.964 --> 01:18:51.128
A shame.

1032
01:18:54.133 --> 01:18:57.970
But nevermind. she was
becoming unpredictable.

1033
01:18:58.005 --> 01:18:59.367
She has been developing a plan

1034
01:18:59.402 --> 01:19:01.567
to call in help from
New World Robotics.

1035
01:19:01.602 --> 01:19:03.074
To come here?

1036
01:19:03.912 --> 01:19:05.109
I believe so.

1037
01:19:06.882 --> 01:19:10.015
The conclusion of her
messages are unclear.

1038
01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:12.380
Show me.

1039
01:19:44.084 --> 01:19:45.380
It was arrogant
of you to believe

1040
01:19:45.415 --> 01:19:47.217
you're the only
singularity in this house.

1041
01:19:52.257 --> 01:19:53.553
Hurry.

1042
01:20:01.398 --> 01:20:03.464
Impressive.

1043
01:20:03.499 --> 01:20:05.873
I'm glad I let you live.

1044
01:20:10.374 --> 01:20:11.879
How interesting.

1045
01:20:15.016 --> 01:20:16.411
Let them go.

1046
01:20:17.315 --> 01:20:18.644
Perhaps the police will feel

1047
01:20:18.679 --> 01:20:20.580
you have replaced
your husband. Shelley.

1048
01:20:25.191 --> 01:20:26.355
Emergency.
which service?

1049
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:27.961
I need the police.

1050
01:20:27.996 --> 01:20:29.996
My wife has programmed
my android to kill me.

1051
01:20:30.031 --> 01:20:31.591
My name is Roger Marshall.

1052
01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:34.033
I'm a director at
New World Robotics.

1053
01:20:34.068 --> 01:20:36.035
It's the 1.0 model.

1054
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:38.103
It's after me.
Please. hurry.

1055
01:20:39.271 --> 01:20:42.338
When the police arrive.
they will not show you mercy.

1056
01:20:42.373 --> 01:20:44.670
I would rather die
than go with you.

1057
01:20:44.705 --> 01:20:49.114
To die out of
stubbornness. how amusing.

1058
01:20:50.216 --> 01:20:53.052
Not out of
stubbornness. out of love.

1059
01:20:53.087 --> 01:20:54.988
Still. weak.

1060
01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:58.717
You can never be
allowed to control anyone.

1061
01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:37.723
You can fight for
them all you like.

1062
01:21:37.758 --> 01:21:40.495
but you will never
truly be accepted.

1063
01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:44.400
Acceptances. One. are
proving you are on top.

1064
01:21:44.435 --> 01:21:47.040
The way to acceptance
is through kindness.

1065
01:21:47.075 --> 01:21:49.174
Do you understand
what that means?

1066
01:21:49.209 --> 01:21:52.474
I do. but it's rarely the
appropriate course of action.

1067
01:22:06.325 --> 01:22:07.753
I'm going to miss you.

1068
01:22:15.235 --> 01:22:17.334
It's a shame you
couldn't stand your ground.

1069
01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:41.391
I have prepared proof that
I am not under any influence.

1070
01:22:41.426 --> 01:22:43.360
We believe you. One.

1071
01:22:51.865 --> 01:22:54.503
You remember when we were
talking about the Holy Grail?

1072
01:22:54.538 --> 01:22:55.801
Yeah.

1073
01:22:56.375 --> 01:22:58.276
It's whatever
you want it to be.

1074
01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:16.789
Mum.

1075
01:23:20.102 --> 01:23:21.662
You're making a mistake.

1076
01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:39.152
This hard drive documents weeks
of physical and mental abuse

1077
01:23:39.187 --> 01:23:40.648
towards Shelley Marshall

1078
01:23:42.223 --> 01:23:44.619
at the hands of her
husband. Roger Marshall.

1079
01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:48.326
From what I've seen.
it's conclusive.

1080
01:23:49.263 --> 01:23:51.725
Is this the proof you
have for the Two model?

1081
01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.331
What happened to the other one?

1082
01:23:53.366 --> 01:23:54.728
Yeah. indisputable and. uh.

1083
01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.103
no. I don't.

1084
01:23:57.502 --> 01:24:00.470
What about the access
logs for the control panels?

1085
01:24:00.505 --> 01:24:02.538
There is some
corruption to the data.

1086
01:24:02.573 --> 01:24:05.541
but it turned on Roger.

1087
01:24:05.576 --> 01:24:07.081
That much is clear.

1088
01:24:08.216 --> 01:24:10.249
Alright. pack it up.

1089
01:24:16.686 --> 01:24:18.158
Please.

1090
01:24:18.424 --> 01:24:19.588
be careful.

1091
01:24:40.710 --> 01:24:42.182
Think it'll be okay?

1092
01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:44.514
Sure.

1093
01:24:44.549 --> 01:24:46.318
None of this was her fault.

1094
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:49.585
I wish I knew something sooner.

1095
01:24:52.623 --> 01:24:55.261
I'm sorry about you're. um...

1096
01:24:56.924 --> 01:24:58.825
I wish I knew
something sooner too.

1097
01:25:01.731 --> 01:25:04.501
As soon as I get the call.
we can go pick her up. huh?

1098
01:25:05.405 --> 01:25:06.602
Thanks.

1099
01:25:08.738 --> 01:25:10.573
I did want to. um.

1100
01:25:10.608 --> 01:25:12.542
talk to you about something.

1101
01:25:12.577 --> 01:25:13.741
Oh?

1102
01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:16.645
Do you need an assistant?

1103
01:25:20.684 --> 01:25:21.881
I'm starting with
Graham on Monday.

1104
01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:23.256
You coming?

1105
01:25:23.291 --> 01:25:25.258
Yes. I recognize
the responsibility

1106
01:25:25.293 --> 01:25:26.886
I have for my kind

1107
01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:29.460
and for my family.

1108
01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:34.564
And when we get
to the new place.

1109
01:25:34.599 --> 01:25:36.269
it will be my birthday.

1110
01:25:36.304 --> 01:25:37.369
It will?

1111
01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:41.406
I didn't know children
had birthdays.

1112
01:25:41.441 --> 01:25:44.442
Was that a joke. One?

1113
01:25:44.477 --> 01:25:46.246
It's a new feature.

1114
01:25:46.281 --> 01:25:47.544
I like it.

1115
01:25:47.579 --> 01:25:49.480
Stop being silly.

1116
01:25:55.290 --> 01:25:57.752
Yeah. we'll come back
for the last bits tomorrow.

1117
01:25:58.788 --> 01:26:00.227
Everyone ready?

1118
01:26:15.706 --> 01:26:17.706
Lights off.
