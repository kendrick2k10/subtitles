(gun popping)

6
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.748
- [Joseph] I'm General
Joseph Wheeler.

7
00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:56.384
Confederate States of America.

8
00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.054
What you're looking at
here is Savannah River.

9
00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.557
That's the line between
Georgia and South Carolina.

10
00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:07.060
It's a pretty good-sized river.

11
00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:10.063
We thought it'd keep the
Yanks on the Georgia side.

12
00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:14.235
at least until I could muster
up my cavalry together.

13
00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:18.105
But it was a hell
of a lot of Yanks.

14
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.941
and they had everything they
needed to cause us trouble.

15
00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:31.819
- Begging your pardon. General.

16
00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.821
We received word that
Kilpatrick and his men

17
00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:35.789
have crossed the
to Savannah River.

18
00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:38.025
- Is this 100%

19
00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:39.126
- Yes. it is. General.

20
00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:42.530
- We may be able
to fall back again.

21
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.697
regroup a little better.

22
00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:48.202
- No. we can't keep doing that.

23
00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:50.137
- What would you
like us to do. sir?

24
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.343
- We'll make a stand
at Broxton's Bridge.

25
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.447
(water lapping)

26
00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:06.554
(insects chirping)

27
00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:21.802
- What's your report. Major?

28
00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:23.737
- Everyone we need is
across the river. sir.

29
00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:27.074
- Finally. It only
took two days.

30
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.311
- That's quite an ordeal. sir.
We're talking 60.000 troops.

31
00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:32.980
- What's the scout's report
and the enemy disposition?

32
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.415
- Well. they're
mainly scattered.

33
00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:36.350
but they're coming together
at Broxton Bridge. sir.

34
00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:38.919
- What type of troops are they?

35
00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.889
- Some solid artillery
but mainly cavalry.

36
00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.358
- Ah. cavalry. That'd
be Joe Wheeler?

37
00:03:44.392 --> 00:03:46.660
- That would be correct. sir.

38
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.828
- My old friend.

39
00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:50.498
Well. maybe this time
I'll get a chance to put

40
00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:51.899
a bullet through his skull.

41
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.935
- Well. that'd be
a fine day. sir.

42
00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:57.271
But what else do you
need from me. sir?

43
00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:58.772
- Who's the best scout you got?

44
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.842
- That would be Masterson. sir.

45
00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:03.043
- All right. I want
a meeting with him.

46
00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.078
you. and me and that's
it. you understand?

47
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:05.913
- Yes. sir.

48
00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:07.080
- All right. carry on.

49
00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.852
(water lapping)

50
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.583

00:05:56.957 --> 00:06:01.862
(people shouting)
(guns popping)

54
00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.323
(guns popping)

55
00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:52.045
(people shouting)

56
00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:06.059
- Right here!

57
00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:10.430
(guns popping)

58
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.436
- Let's go!

59
00:08:36.684 --> 00:08:40.053
(upbeat whistling music)

60
00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:03.911
(dramatic music)

61
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:17.057
- Take cover. take cover!

62
00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:19.993
(cannons blasting)

63
00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.619
(dramatic music)

64
00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:15.649

65
00:13:36.984 --> 00:13:38.351
(people shouting)

66
00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:41.021
(cannon blasts)

67
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.038
- Fire!

68
00:14:54.094 --> 00:14:56.829
(dramatic music)

69
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.908
(water lapping)

70
00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:28.321
- Masterson. Maddox says you're
the best scout we've got.

71
00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.757
- I can find my way around
here pretty good. sir.

72
00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.694
- Excellent. What I need
is good intelligence.

73
00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:37.130
real information about
General Wheeler's whereabouts.

74
00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:38.765
you understand?

75
00:16:38.765 --> 00:16:41.934
- Yes. sir. I imagine he's
with his troops right now.

76
00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:44.137
- He could be with them.
he could be one of them.

77
00:16:44.137 --> 00:16:47.274
He's a slippery son of a bitch.

78
00:16:47.274 --> 00:16:49.609
He's like a snake in
the grass. Wheeler is.

79
00:16:49.609 --> 00:16:51.444
You stomp on him.
you lift your boot.

80
00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:53.646
and he's not there anymore.

81
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.349
Him and his troops.
they just slither away.

82
00:16:57.384 --> 00:16:59.286
- So he could be anywhere.

83
00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:01.988
- Well. he has to maintain
command of his troops.

84
00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:05.225
They're an army of
ghosts. vanished into dust

85
00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:08.895
right outside of Atlanta.
and here they are.

86
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:13.133
- So. do I get a bonus if
I take care of business?

87
00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:15.868
- Well. it depends on
what you mean by business.

88
00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.838
- Well. you want
Wheeler dead. right?

89
00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:21.374
- Yes. I do want Wheeler dead.

90
00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:22.909
And if you can arrange that.

91
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:26.213
you'll be very well taken
care of financially.

92
00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:31.684
(dramatic music)

93
00:18:01.848 --> 00:18:03.850
- I'm looking for Mama Thorn.

94
00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.219
- Well. this is her swamp.

95
00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:07.754
- Better watch out
around that swamp.

96
00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.356
That old swamp witch'll get you.

97
00:18:17.864 --> 00:18:20.300
- This ain't her place. is it?

98
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.703
- Oh. no. Her place
ain't so grandiose.

99
00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:25.605
- That's who the
general wants to see.

100
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.746
- OK. when we get
close. y'all hold back.

101
00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:35.815
She don't like a whole
lot of people. now.

102
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.851
- Come on in. Joe.

103
00:19:33.873 --> 00:19:35.342
- Mama Thorn.

104
00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:39.212
- Been a piece since your
last visit. What news you got?

105
00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:40.947
- Yanks have crossed
the Savannah River.

106
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.014
- That I knew.

107
00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:44.551
- They're heading this way.

108
00:19:45.452 --> 00:19:47.487
- That I didn't know.

109
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.989
How long you figure
'fore they get here?

110
00:19:49.989 --> 00:19:51.558
- Well. they brought what they
needed to cross the Savannah

111
00:19:51.558 --> 00:19:54.394
to River. Swamp might
slow them down a bit.

112
00:19:54.394 --> 00:19:56.729
- My swamp will slow
them down a lot.

113
00:19:56.796 --> 00:19:59.999
Water's cold this time of
year. At least a day or two.

114
00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:03.403
- If that. You
gonna hightail it?

115
00:20:03.403 --> 00:20:06.639
- I been here a long time.
Why should I leave now?

116
00:20:06.673 --> 00:20:09.509
- These boys. they
ain't so friendly.

117
00:20:09.509 --> 00:20:12.078
- I've seen plenty
of soldiers before.

118
00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:15.147
- These are different.
All the way up the line.

119
00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:16.649
- What do you mean?

120
00:20:16.649 --> 00:20:19.819
- I know their cavalry
commander from way back.

121
00:20:19.852 --> 00:20:21.321
- Who's he?

122
00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:25.258
- Name's Kilpatrick. We
went to West Point together.

123
00:20:25.258 --> 00:20:29.696
- Sounds like an Irishman.
I can handle an Irishman.

124
00:20:31.864 --> 00:20:34.267
- Kilpatrick only
answers to one person.

125
00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.035
- Sherman.

126
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:39.238
- Both of these men are
rough on local folks.

127
00:20:40.607 --> 00:20:44.043
- So they're punishing the
people that ain't even fighting.

128
00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:46.413
- That's right. And
you need to be careful.

129
00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:48.180
- I ain't worried
about these Yanks.

130
00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.618
You suppose they'll be
asking your whereabouts?

131
00:20:52.852 --> 00:20:53.620
- Probably.

132
00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.925
- How 'bout if I send them
to your family cemetery?

133
00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:05.064
- I just may have to pay my
respects after the battle.

134
00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:06.466
- You just might.

135
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.570
(birds chirping)

136
00:21:13.906 --> 00:21:16.743
- Is there anything else you
think you will be requiring?

137
00:21:16.743 --> 00:21:19.579
- Yes. Be sure the men
have plenty of matches.

138
00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.481
I know we lost a lot
when they got wet

139
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:24.417
when we were crossing
the uh. swamps.

140
00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:26.953
- Yes sir. but please
remember we did purchase

141
00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:28.488
every matchstick in Savannah.

142
00:21:28.555 --> 00:21:31.624
- I know. I know.
Just make sure.

143
00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:33.125
- Yes. sir.

144
00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:36.463
- And uh. have we heard from
the scout yet. Masterson?

145
00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:38.130
- Nothing concrete.

146
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.134
However. his reports do confirm
our earlier intelligence

147
00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.804
that the rebel
cavalry is scattered.

148
00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:47.840
and heading in the general
direction of Aiken.

149
00:21:47.907 --> 00:21:51.243
- Is there anything else?
I have ladies waiting.

150
00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:54.481
- One thing. sir. we
are approaching the
town of Barnwell.

151
00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:56.849
and it seems a number
of clergy and merchants

152
00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:58.951
wish to hold a meeting with you.

153
00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:03.856
- Oh. God. All right.
uh. one meeting though.

154
00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:05.925
Narrow it down.

155
00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:08.595
I want to meet with one person.
somebody from the clergy.

156
00:22:08.628 --> 00:22:10.597
no merchants. all right.

157
00:22:10.597 --> 00:22:11.964
Two minutes.

158
00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:16.268
One person. one meeting.
two minutes. Understand?

159
00:22:16.268 --> 00:22:18.337
- Yes. sir. Thank you. sir.

160
00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:19.171
- Very well.

161
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.477
- My name is Hugh
Judson Kilpatrick.

162
00:22:24.477 --> 00:22:27.346
My highest to rank
was Major General.

163
00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:30.550
and that's of course
in the real army.

164
00:22:30.617 --> 00:22:34.153
which would be the army of
the United States of America.

165
00:22:35.622 --> 00:22:39.959
I've been called ambitious.
aggressive. and blustery.

166
00:22:39.992 --> 00:22:43.295
I must say I agree
on all counts.

167
00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:45.498
I have also been
called fearless.

168
00:22:46.666 --> 00:22:49.335
And that is how I
hope I am remembered.

169
00:22:54.073 --> 00:22:58.010
- Rumor has it Wheeler
is really really close.

170
00:22:58.044 --> 00:23:00.046
- There's always a
rumor. Major Maddox.

171
00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:01.414
What I'm interested in

172
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:03.349
is what our men have
actually laid their eyes on.

173
00:23:04.817 --> 00:23:07.654
- I've got Masterson on his
trail. Best scout we have.

174
00:23:08.988 --> 00:23:12.158
- That man is a bloodhound.
I'll give you that.

175
00:23:12.158 --> 00:23:13.760
- That's the kind
of man we need.

176
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.600
- Who the hell is this?

177
00:23:21.868 --> 00:23:23.870
- Who are you? What's
your business here?

178
00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:26.673
- I don't mean to
make no trouble.

179
00:23:26.673 --> 00:23:28.675
I know you two
fellas are very busy.

180
00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:32.211
- Come closer.
please. and speak up.

181
00:23:35.047 --> 00:23:36.849
- That's as far as you go.

182
00:23:36.849 --> 00:23:38.951
Don't have any weapons
on you. do you?

183
00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:42.755
- No. sir. I'm Reverend Fuller.

184
00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:45.858
My congregation is the
Independent Baptist Church

185
00:23:45.892 --> 00:23:47.460
of Barnwell. South Carolina.

186
00:23:48.728 --> 00:23:51.698
- Why does that ring
a bell? Barnwell?

187
00:23:51.698 --> 00:23:53.533
- It's right in the middle
of our path to Aiken.

188
00:23:55.468 --> 00:23:57.637
- What's your business
with us. Reverend?

189
00:23:58.871 --> 00:24:03.109
- General. Major.
when's the last time

190
00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:04.544
you gentlemen went to church?

191
00:24:05.878 --> 00:24:08.414
- It's been quite
some time. Reverend.

192
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:11.083
- Well if you should happen
to pass through Barnwell.

193
00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:14.086
I'd like to invite you
to services at my church.

194
00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:18.725
The services would be at
your convenience. of course.

195
00:24:18.758 --> 00:24:22.929
- Really? Well. that would
certainly be a change of pace.

196
00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:26.799
What do you think. Captain?

197
00:24:26.833 --> 00:24:27.934
- Is that why you're
here. Reverend?

198
00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:30.402
To ask us to go to church?

199
00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:31.337
- That is correct.

200
00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:35.808
Your presence would show the
good people of South Carolina

201
00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:39.579
that you and your men would
like to have a peaceful

202
00:24:39.612 --> 00:24:41.981
end to this terrible conflict.

203
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:45.084
- That's not the only
reason you're here.

204
00:24:45.117 --> 00:24:47.987
or it's not the primary
reason you're here.

205
00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:49.689
Why don't you tell
us what that is?

206
00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:54.794
- I heard tell of you
fellers burning through

207
00:24:54.794 --> 00:24:58.831
a lot of places. especially
since you crossed the river.

208
00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:01.834
- Reverend. we burn
any structure that
harbors resistance.

209
00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:04.003
Those are our orders.

210
00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:08.507
- As such. I figured if you
attended services at my church.

211
00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:12.211
that you would see that
we harbored no resistance

212
00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:15.381
and our doors are
always open to any

213
00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:18.951
that would love to
worship. black or white.

214
00:25:18.985 --> 00:25:21.487
- Well. I don't know if we'll
make the services or not.

215
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.990
Reverend. but I
will tell you this.

216
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.358
If we have to burn
structures in Barnwell.

217
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:30.362
we will not burn the
Independent Baptist Church.

218
00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:31.998
- Feels awful good to hear that.

219
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:35.568
Our little church started
in a one room shack

220
00:25:35.635 --> 00:25:37.369
about 10 years ago.

221
00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:40.840
We recently fixed it
up. added on a bit.

222
00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:43.142
added a little
small cross tower.

223
00:25:43.142 --> 00:25:45.645
It isn't much. but
we're proud of it.

224
00:25:45.678 --> 00:25:47.479
and it would really
calm my nerves

225
00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:50.583
to get your personal
guarantee on this. General.

226
00:25:50.583 --> 00:25:54.186
- Reverend. you have
my personal guarantee.

227
00:25:57.323 --> 00:25:58.858
- Thank you.

228
00:25:58.891 --> 00:26:01.694
Gentlemen. I sincerely
appreciate your
time this evening.

229
00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:08.768
- Spare the man's church.

230
00:26:09.736 --> 00:26:11.570
- Hell no. Burn the whole town.

231
00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:17.243
- Copeland.

232
00:26:17.276 --> 00:26:18.110
- Sir.

233
00:26:23.883 --> 00:26:25.685
- You notice some of
the men had new gear.

234
00:26:25.685 --> 00:26:26.585
- Yes. sir.

235
00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:27.854
There's a new supplier in town.

236
00:26:27.887 --> 00:26:30.757
and he's quite pleased
to take our money.

237
00:26:30.757 --> 00:26:32.024
- That's rare these days.

238
00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:35.594
- Well. actually he
was looking for you.

239
00:26:39.265 --> 00:26:42.434
- Was he now? What business
did he have for me?

240
00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:45.037
- Don't know. He only wanted
to discuss it with you.

241
00:26:46.305 --> 00:26:49.075
- Okay then. You been scouting?

242
00:26:49.108 --> 00:26:51.110
- As you ordered. sir.

243
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.545
- What'd you find
out about Kilpatrick?

244
00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:56.548
- He's definitely on the
move as you thought. but-

245
00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.952
- But what?

246
00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:02.989
- He doesn't appear to be
moving directly to Augusta.

247
00:27:03.055 --> 00:27:04.290
- Where then?

248
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.793
- Maybe. maybe Aiken.

249
00:27:06.826 --> 00:27:09.161
- Aiken? Why Aiken?

250
00:27:09.161 --> 00:27:11.664
- Not figuring
that one out. sir.

251
00:27:13.132 --> 00:27:15.802
- Huh. Augusta would make sense.

252
00:27:18.805 --> 00:27:21.007
- Yes. sir. with the
powder works and all.

253
00:27:21.073 --> 00:27:25.144
- Yeah. Columbia's Columbia.

254
00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:26.645
- What do you think
we should do. sir?

255
00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:30.449
- Headed for Aiken? That means
he's going to hit Barnwell.

256
00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:32.484
- Yes. sir. right through it.

257
00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:35.287
- Lordy. I got
good friends there.

258
00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:38.290
- Well. we can throw
some troops that way.

259
00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:43.095
- No. we got a good
chance here at something.

260
00:27:43.095 --> 00:27:44.130
- All right.

261
00:27:44.997 --> 00:27:46.432
- Well. for every man you got.

262
00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:48.134
we're gonna make
a stand in Aiken.

263
00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:54.206
(fire crackling)
(dramatic music)

264
00:28:04.116 --> 00:28:07.787
- Boys. the name of
this town is Barnwell.

265
00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.858
but tonight it's Burnwell!

266
00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:15.828
- Yeah! Burnwell.
Burnwell. Burnwell.

267
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:23.702
Burnwell. Burnwell. Burnwell.
Burnwell. Burnwell. Burnwell!

268
00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:25.738
- Burn it to the ground. boys!

269
00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:28.140
- Yeah! Burnwell.
Burnwell. Burnwell.

270
00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:34.546
Burnwell. Burnwell. Burnwell.
Burnwell. Burnwell. Burnwell!

271
00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:55.768
(somber music)

272
00:29:28.968 --> 00:29:33.973
- They promised. They promised
they wouldn't burn it.

273
00:29:44.884 --> 00:29:47.786
- I'm sorry. Come. my friend.

274
00:30:16.682 --> 00:30:20.352
- Who's that sneaking
around my door?

275
00:30:20.352 --> 00:30:21.187
- A friend.

276
00:30:22.688 --> 00:30:24.690
- I can tell when a
friend's at my door.

277
00:30:25.858 --> 00:30:27.826
- I didn't mean to
cause no interruption.

278
00:30:29.295 --> 00:30:32.131
I don't have a gun if that's
what you're worried about.

279
00:30:32.131 --> 00:30:33.765
- What I'm worried
about is you don't want

280
00:30:33.765 --> 00:30:36.268
to tell me who you are.

281
00:30:36.268 --> 00:30:38.804
- Name's Masterson.
Just want to talk.

282
00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:41.941
- Then come on in and talk.

283
00:30:56.622 --> 00:30:58.624
- So you're the one
they call Mama Thorn.

284
00:30:58.624 --> 00:31:00.392
- That's right.

285
00:31:00.392 --> 00:31:02.494
- So you fancy yourself
some type of witch.

286
00:31:04.063 --> 00:31:06.732
- I know what I am. Swamp witch.

287
00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:09.235
Most dangerous kind there is.

288
00:31:11.137 --> 00:31:14.073
- I guess I better
be careful then.

289
00:31:14.073 --> 00:31:17.409
- Finally a piece of
fine thinking out of you.

290
00:31:17.476 --> 00:31:19.578
You do know I charge
for my services.

291
00:31:21.047 --> 00:31:22.381
- You mean for soothsaying?

292
00:31:23.315 --> 00:31:25.484
I guess that's not out of line.

293
00:31:25.484 --> 00:31:27.186
So what kind of payment
are you looking for?

294
00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:28.654
- How about some truth?

295
00:31:30.522 --> 00:31:31.357
- Truth?

296
00:31:32.758 --> 00:31:35.494
- Truth. I've had enough
of lying and double talk.

297
00:31:36.695 --> 00:31:39.031
- The truth can be
a very thorny place.

298
00:31:39.031 --> 00:31:40.032
It can tear you up.

299
00:31:42.568 --> 00:31:44.870
- Is that some kind of threat?

300
00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:48.074
- No. ma'am. I'm just
here to ask questions.

301
00:31:48.074 --> 00:31:49.241
- So ask.

302
00:31:50.876 --> 00:31:53.545
- Well. you were
kind of hard to find.

303
00:31:53.545 --> 00:31:55.714
- That ain't no question.

304
00:31:55.714 --> 00:31:57.249
And I ain't hard to find

305
00:31:57.249 --> 00:31:59.085
for those who are
supposed to find me.

306
00:32:00.286 --> 00:32:02.254
- Well. I am aware
that General Wheeler

307
00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:03.455
has been here to see you.

308
00:32:06.192 --> 00:32:07.759
- I see a lot of folks.

309
00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.228
- Not a lot of generals.

310
00:32:10.462 --> 00:32:11.964
- You'd be surprised.

311
00:32:13.399 --> 00:32:16.235
- So what. what did you and
fighting Joe have to talk about?

312
00:32:17.636 --> 00:32:21.473
- Mister. I have no reason
at all to tell you about

313
00:32:21.473 --> 00:32:22.975
my private conversations.

314
00:32:25.111 --> 00:32:26.612
- What about self-preservation?

315
00:32:28.214 --> 00:32:31.550
- Now that is a threat.

316
00:32:31.583 --> 00:32:33.319
- Not from me.

317
00:32:33.319 --> 00:32:34.553
- Then from who?

318
00:32:34.586 --> 00:32:36.288
- I'll tell you what.

319
00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:38.991
You answer my questions.
I'll answer yours.

320
00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:42.561
- You like playing
this game. Masterson.

321
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:45.897
- Sure. if it pays off. And you?

322
00:32:45.931 --> 00:32:47.799
- I can be very.
very good at it.

323
00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:50.802
- I got money. United
States currency.

324
00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:52.304
Not that funny money
that they're trying

325
00:32:52.338 --> 00:32:53.905
to pass off down here.

326
00:32:53.939 --> 00:32:55.907
- Ain't interested.

327
00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:59.245
- So can I give to you
to get what I want?

328
00:32:59.278 --> 00:33:02.814
- Masterson. there is absolutely
nothing you can offer me

329
00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:04.983
that would make me
betray a good friend.

330
00:33:06.085 --> 00:33:07.353
- You're making a mistake.

331
00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.823
- I know what I'm doing.

332
00:33:11.857 --> 00:33:14.626
You go back and report
now to General Kilpatrick.

333
00:33:19.298 --> 00:33:20.966
- The next visit
won't be from me.

334
00:33:22.601 --> 00:33:23.802
And I bet it's not as friendly.

335
00:33:57.203 --> 00:34:01.540
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa. Reverend.

336
00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:05.644
- Hey. Joe. Dobbs.

337
00:34:07.213 --> 00:34:08.580
- Good to see you alive.

338
00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:11.983
Heard there's nothing
left of Barnwell.

339
00:34:12.017 --> 00:34:13.652
- Sorry about your
church. Reverend.

340
00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:17.589
- That was my life.

341
00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:22.261
- Well. this is in the middle
of nowhere. Did you walk here?

342
00:34:22.328 --> 00:34:27.166
- I did. I walked until
I couldn't walk anymore.

343
00:34:29.168 --> 00:34:32.171
I don't know how long I
been sitting on these steps

344
00:34:32.171 --> 00:34:35.874
but I think I'll find me a
peaceful grove somewhere.

345
00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:38.944
lay down and let the
earth take me back.

346
00:34:40.846 --> 00:34:42.348
- I got an idea.

347
00:34:42.348 --> 00:34:44.516
After the battle.
I'll take a platoon

348
00:34:44.516 --> 00:34:46.385
and go and rebuild
his church for him.

349
00:34:48.053 --> 00:34:51.257
- What now? What
about the Yanks?

350
00:34:51.257 --> 00:34:52.258
They'd be all over.

351
00:34:53.692 --> 00:34:54.893
- That ain't what I been seeing.

352
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.862
They come in. tear
up and haul out.

353
00:34:57.729 --> 00:34:58.630
- That's right.

354
00:35:00.132 --> 00:35:03.068
- Y'all know I wouldn't be
able to pay you nothing.

355
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:05.103
- Hey. I got a young
lass I plan on marrying

356
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:06.772
when this is all over.

357
00:35:06.772 --> 00:35:09.775
If you could do the honors.
that would be payment enough.

358
00:35:09.808 --> 00:35:12.144
- I know where some nice
timber's being stored.

359
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.047
- That's be fine. gentlemen.

360
00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:19.651
- Is there anything
we can do for you?

361
00:35:19.651 --> 00:35:21.153
Can we send some men
over to give you a hand?

362
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.155
- Maybe some water.

363
00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:26.725
- Corporal. give him some water.

364
00:35:51.617 --> 00:35:53.352
- You ain't invited.

365
00:35:54.453 --> 00:35:55.354
- I'm not alone.

366
00:35:56.588 --> 00:35:58.590
What I'm looking for is
any information you have

367
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.593
against the rebel
general Joseph Wheeler.

368
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.264
- I don't know where
General Wheeler is.

369
00:36:07.266 --> 00:36:10.602
- I need to know. Is he
planning on attacking us?

370
00:36:10.636 --> 00:36:12.371
And what is his troop strength?

371
00:36:12.371 --> 00:36:16.342
- I ain't no soldier. Why would
I know nonsense like that?

372
00:36:17.209 --> 00:36:19.511
- Then what do you talk about?

373
00:36:19.511 --> 00:36:21.447
- Healings for his wounded.

374
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:25.784
Getting messages to their
families. Important things.

375
00:36:25.784 --> 00:36:28.220
- Ma'am. I have
food. Plenty of food.

376
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.322
- I got the forest
and the swamp.

377
00:36:30.356 --> 00:36:32.524
I can get all the food I need.

378
00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:36.061
- Fine. We have U.S.
currency. silver.

379
00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:39.565
We'd pay a good bit if you'd
show me the whereabouts

380
00:36:39.565 --> 00:36:40.499
of General Wheeler.

381
00:36:41.467 --> 00:36:43.469
- Ain't interested.

382
00:36:43.469 --> 00:36:46.372
- You need to be telling
me what you know.

383
00:36:46.372 --> 00:36:48.039
- I can't tell you
what I don't know.

384
00:36:48.073 --> 00:36:51.343
and I don't know where
General Wheeler is right now.

385
00:36:53.479 --> 00:36:54.313
- Don't move.

386
00:37:18.003 --> 00:37:21.273
- Mama Thorn. I'm
General Hugh Kilpatrick.

387
00:37:21.273 --> 00:37:24.109
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

388
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:26.778
- You and your men
ain't welcome here.

389
00:37:29.415 --> 00:37:33.118
- Mama Thorn. we've got
something to discuss. ma'am.

390
00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:35.354
Do you believe in the
institution of slavery?

391
00:37:35.387 --> 00:37:38.056
Do you believe that human
beings should be chained up

392
00:37:38.056 --> 00:37:39.758
and traded like cattle?

393
00:37:39.758 --> 00:37:41.226
- No. I do not.

394
00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:44.396
- Well. good. We have
something in common. then.

395
00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:47.899
Now our great army
has swept through

396
00:37:47.899 --> 00:37:49.635
most of this
so-called Confederacy.

397
00:37:49.635 --> 00:37:51.136
and do you know what
we've left in our wake

398
00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:52.270
everywhere we've gone?

399
00:37:53.439 --> 00:37:55.474
- Burned buildings
and ruined land.

400
00:37:55.541 --> 00:37:58.209
- Freedom. Mama Thorn.

401
00:37:58.243 --> 00:38:01.380
Now I've freed slaves
in Tennessee. Georgia.

402
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.614
and now South Carolina.

403
00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:04.282
We are not the enemy.

404
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:07.419
- You are taking the crops
and belongings of poor people.

405
00:38:07.453 --> 00:38:10.288
people who work
hard for a living.

406
00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:13.325
These ain't the rich
folk who owned slaves.

407
00:38:13.392 --> 00:38:15.894
- War is a cruel and
heartless endeavor. ma'am.

408
00:38:15.927 --> 00:38:18.296
- You're making war on children.

409
00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:21.733
What you leave in your
wake are children.

410
00:38:21.767 --> 00:38:24.836
with nothing to eat.
nowhere to sleep in the

411
00:38:24.836 --> 00:38:26.171
dead of winter.

412
00:38:26.171 --> 00:38:28.640
- This is a war
that was brought on

413
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.308
by an illegal government.

414
00:38:30.342 --> 00:38:33.078
an illegal government
supported by people like you.

415
00:38:33.111 --> 00:38:38.116
- I don't support no government.
and I don't support no war.

416
00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:40.486
I support the people.

417
00:38:40.486 --> 00:38:42.654
- Well. I believe this building

418
00:38:42.688 --> 00:38:44.856
is harboring rebel resistance.

419
00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:47.125
So we're leaving. and
I'm gonna have my men

420
00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:48.760
nail the windows
and the doors shut.

421
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.363
and set fire to this
place with you in it.

422
00:38:51.363 --> 00:38:52.931
And if you don't
think I'll do it.

423
00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:55.300
you better remember
what I have done.

424
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:56.167
Let's go.

425
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:59.538
- General Kill.

426
00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.142
Everybody knows that Joe
Wheeler is getting ready

427
00:39:04.142 --> 00:39:06.344
for some big battle.

428
00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:08.213
I don't know nothing about that.

429
00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:11.049
But I'm pretty sure that
when the fighting's over.

430
00:39:11.049 --> 00:39:13.051
no matter what happens.

431
00:39:13.051 --> 00:39:16.622
he's gonna want to go
to his family cemetery.

432
00:39:16.655 --> 00:39:19.324
That's just down the road
from his home in Augusta.

433
00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:23.128
That'll be after the battle.
before he heads out to regroup.

434
00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:29.134
- I'm gonna put
guards on this place.

435
00:39:29.134 --> 00:39:32.203
If what you say is
true. you'll be free.

436
00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:36.374
But if not. I'm gonna burn
everything here to the ground.

437
00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:37.509
Good day. ma'am.

438
00:39:44.149 --> 00:39:46.818
(water rushing)

439
00:39:52.057 --> 00:39:54.993
(birds twittering)

440
00:40:01.199 --> 00:40:02.768
- Hello. Mama Thorn.

441
00:40:02.768 --> 00:40:04.603
- Well. look who's
all soldiered up.

442
00:40:04.603 --> 00:40:06.104
Good to see you again. Marcus.

443
00:40:07.072 --> 00:40:09.274
- I'm liking the
feel of freedom.

444
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.842
- That's good.

445
00:40:10.876 --> 00:40:12.678
You know. when I put someone
on the railroad to Harriet.

446
00:40:12.678 --> 00:40:14.946
I never know if they're
gonna make it or not.

447
00:40:14.946 --> 00:40:17.382
Even I don't know the
routes past South Carolina.

448
00:40:18.784 --> 00:40:21.753
- Things was tough for a while
but I made it up to Boston

449
00:40:21.753 --> 00:40:24.690
and joined the
54th Massachusetts.

450
00:40:26.357 --> 00:40:28.026
- Well. you're taking
a big chance being back

451
00:40:28.059 --> 00:40:30.395
in this neck of the woods.

452
00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:32.230
Rebel army ain't
taking no prisoners

453
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.565
when it comes to ex-slaves.

454
00:40:33.565 --> 00:40:35.901
I hear they're
shooting them on sight.

455
00:40:35.934 --> 00:40:38.436
- I heard the same thing.
That's why I'm fighting.

456
00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:42.407
- But you made it back. just
like you said you would.

457
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.077
- I almost didn't. I was
up around Charleston.

458
00:40:46.077 --> 00:40:47.245
Lost a lot of boys.

459
00:40:48.814 --> 00:40:50.816
- Got any plans
for after the war?

460
00:40:50.816 --> 00:40:53.652
- I want to see if I can
find any of my family.

461
00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:56.054
- You know. your
brother got sold

462
00:40:56.087 --> 00:40:57.923
before I could put
him on the railroad.

463
00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:00.258
- I heard.

464
00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:03.094
- Try looking for
him in Augusta.

465
00:41:03.094 --> 00:41:04.596
You know. a lot of
these black folk there.

466
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.165
they don't know
they're free yet.

467
00:41:07.165 --> 00:41:08.634
- I'll be sure to tell them.

468
00:41:08.634 --> 00:41:09.668
- You want some food?

469
00:41:11.136 --> 00:41:14.806
- I wish I could stay 'cause
I'm tired of eating army grub.

470
00:41:16.174 --> 00:41:17.776
- How much time you got?

471
00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:20.979
- Not much. They're probably
wondering where I'm at.

472
00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:23.682
- Well. Marcus. you always
made my neck of the woods

473
00:41:23.749 --> 00:41:25.584
a better place by being here.

474
00:41:25.584 --> 00:41:28.253
Take care of yourself.
Hope I'll see you again.

475
00:41:28.253 --> 00:41:29.087
- Mama Thorn.

476
00:41:29.087 --> 00:41:31.790
(dramatic music)

477
00:41:54.145 --> 00:41:57.448
- Fancy seeing you
here. Mama Thorn.

478
00:41:57.448 --> 00:42:00.786
- Yep. Them bluecoats
wanted my cabin.

479
00:42:00.819 --> 00:42:02.554
I figured I'd just
let them have it.

480
00:42:04.222 --> 00:42:06.692
- Yeah. I heard.
What you gonna do?

481
00:42:08.193 --> 00:42:10.829
- I'll go wandering a
bit like I always do.

482
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.633
I'm gonna find me
some new roots.

483
00:42:14.633 --> 00:42:17.569
- So? Need to talk
to me about anything?

484
00:42:19.004 --> 00:42:23.508
- I met your opponent.
this Kilpatrick.

485
00:42:23.508 --> 00:42:27.178
- Did you now? What'd
you think of him?

486
00:42:27.178 --> 00:42:29.581
- He likes to shoot
off his mouth a lot.

487
00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:32.183
- Hmmm. Sounds like him.

488
00:42:33.885 --> 00:42:35.887
- He wouldn't stop
barking til I told him

489
00:42:35.921 --> 00:42:37.923
where you were gonna
be after the battle.

490
00:42:39.758 --> 00:42:42.093
- Well. what exactly
did you tell him?

491
00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.329
- Exactly what we talked about.

492
00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:47.398
- Well. I do appreciate that.

493
00:42:47.432 --> 00:42:49.334
How do you think
he's gonna handle it?

494
00:42:50.769 --> 00:42:53.504
- He'll send one of his
bullies like he always does.

495
00:42:56.541 --> 00:43:00.045
- Well. I guess I'll be
seeing you around. Mama Thorn.

496
00:43:00.045 --> 00:43:01.179
- Sure as sunrise.

497
00:43:09.855 --> 00:43:12.590
(dramatic music)

498
00:43:14.025 --> 00:43:17.362
- There are those who
would say that a general

499
00:43:17.395 --> 00:43:19.631
shouldn't be taking
advice from um.

500
00:43:19.631 --> 00:43:22.367
those that call
themselves witches.

501
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.905
They said I had no business
associating with folk like that.

502
00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:29.040
Take Mama Thorn for instance.

503
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.541
She'd been around these parts

504
00:43:30.575 --> 00:43:32.644
since before anyone
can remember.

505
00:43:34.045 --> 00:43:37.282
Did I believe in her mumbling
and spells and all that?

506
00:43:37.282 --> 00:43:40.451
Well. I tell you what
I saw with my own eyes.

507
00:43:44.222 --> 00:43:46.792
When we run out of
medicines for our wounded.

508
00:43:46.792 --> 00:43:49.961
some of her potions and lotions.

509
00:43:49.995 --> 00:43:51.763
they kept some of
them boys alive.

510
00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:55.500
She eased a lot of suffering.

511
00:43:58.169 --> 00:44:00.806
(dramatic music)

512
00:44:07.145 --> 00:44:09.647
(light music)

513
00:44:13.084 --> 00:44:15.821
(dramatic music)

514
00:45:59.424 --> 00:46:01.927
(guns popping)

515
00:46:10.268 --> 00:46:13.104
(people shouting)

516
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:13.932
(somber music)

517
00:47:31.616 --> 00:47:34.185

518
00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:18.096
(people shouting)

519
00:49:18.656 --> 00:49:21.426
(dramatic music)

520
00:50:14.179 --> 00:50:17.515
(bright dramatic music)

521
00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:47.245
(guns popping continues)

522
00:51:58.449 --> 00:52:00.951
(somber music)

523
00:52:22.473 --> 00:52:25.075
(guns popping)

524
00:55:07.738 --> 00:55:10.240
(light music)

525
00:55:16.013 --> 00:55:18.849
(people shouting)

526
00:55:46.611 --> 00:55:50.014
(guns popping continues)

527
00:55:54.519 --> 00:55:57.354
(people shouting)

528
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.703
(dramatic music)

529
01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:47.311
(people shouting)

530
01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.326
(dramatic music)

531
01:01:07.698 --> 01:01:10.300
(guns popping)

532
01:01:58.248 --> 01:02:03.153
(water lapping)
(birds twittering)

533
01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:17.601
(tense music)

534
01:03:48.092 --> 01:03:49.927
- If I'm dead. you're dead.

535
01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:00.104
- I saw you in here. General.

536
01:04:00.137 --> 01:04:02.606
I just want to make
sure you're all right.

537
01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:05.509
- You got a funny way of
showing it. Holster that weapon.

538
01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:13.951
- Fellas. is this the same
man we been talking about?

539
01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:14.818
- He is.

540
01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:16.820
- You're that broker.

541
01:04:18.022 --> 01:04:19.223
- I am.

542
01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:21.992
(dramatic music)

543
01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:36.740
- I recognize you two.
You don't recognize me?

544
01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:39.376
- Yeah. we recognize you.

545
01:04:42.679 --> 01:04:44.014
- That's far enough.

546
01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:46.383
- Hey. I thought
we knew each other.

547
01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:02.866
- I understand you don't
mind Confederate payment.

548
01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:05.069
- That's right. We
can make a deal.

549
01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:07.671
(guns popping)

550
01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:17.047
(dramatic music)

551
01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:32.596
- Paid in full.

552
01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:04.094
- Have a seat. Colonel.

553
01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:04.961
- Thank you. sir.

554
01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.170
- I hope you have
some good news for me.

555
01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.771
- I'm sorry. sir. but I
cannot accommodate you

556
01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:15.639
with that today.

557
01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:19.676
- Ah. very well.

558
01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:22.646
Let's. uh. let's get on with it

559
01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:25.149
so we can get out of
this godforsaken place.

560
01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:28.852
- Yes. sir. We received the
communique from General Sherman.

561
01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:30.754
He wants us to begin
our march on Columbia

562
01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:32.156
as soon as possible.

563
01:06:32.156 --> 01:06:33.490
- Well. that's
not terrible news.

564
01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:35.525
It gets us out of this to place.

565
01:06:35.592 --> 01:06:36.960
- Yes. sir.

566
01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:40.530
In regard to General
Sherman. I put in my request

567
01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:43.167
for a transfer
back to his staff.

568
01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:45.269
- Did you now?

569
01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:46.936
- Yes. sir.

570
01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:50.807
- Well. I guess you've had
enough of this front lines. huh?

571
01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.343
- Yes. sir. I have
had my fill of it.

572
01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:56.680
- Well. that's all right.

573
01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.515
I never thought you had
the sand in your guts

574
01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.317
for this anyway on
the front lines.

575
01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:05.455
Being a Quaker and all.
you all have a tough time

576
01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:06.890
developing a thick hide

577
01:07:08.158 --> 01:07:11.228
for the type of warfare
we're involved in now.

578
01:07:11.228 --> 01:07:13.363
- Yes. sir. possibly.

579
01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.532
- What about the
scout Masterson?

580
01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:17.567
Have we heard back
anything from him?

581
01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:20.470
- We have not heard
from Mr. Masterson.

582
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:23.073
but we did hear
about Mr. Masterson.

583
01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:24.808
- Please report. Colonel.

584
01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:27.844
- I'm afraid to inform you.
sir. that Mr. Masterson is dead.

585
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.182
Yes. sir. and as I understand.

586
01:07:32.216 --> 01:07:34.251
he was on assignment
from you in Augusta.

587
01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:38.555
- And what about
Wheeler. General Wheeler?

588
01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:39.523
Is he dead too?

589
01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:40.690
- No. sir. he is not.

590
01:07:57.674 --> 01:08:00.777
- You know. Colonel.
I don't think we lost

591
01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:02.078
this battle here today.

592
01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:04.414
I don't think so.

593
01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:05.449
- Excuse me. sir?

594
01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.519
- Against Wheeler's men today.

595
01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.259
No. no. I actually think it was
closer to a draw. don't you?

596
01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:17.461
- Sir. they drove us back.

597
01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:23.400
- Yes. but when we get
ready to file our reports

598
01:08:24.568 --> 01:08:27.070
with General Sherman and others.

599
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:30.907
it's important that you
and I are in agreement

600
01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:34.578
on the outcome of the battle
today. if you get my meaning.

601
01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:35.445
Colonel.

602
01:08:35.445 --> 01:08:37.281
- I will not lie. sir.

603
01:08:38.982 --> 01:08:42.152
- Yes. I understand that.
I don't want you to lie.

604
01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:44.654
But you have to admit. Colonel.

605
01:08:44.654 --> 01:08:46.590
there's a lot of
layers to the truth.

606
01:08:46.623 --> 01:08:48.258
It's just like an onion.

607
01:08:48.258 --> 01:08:50.394
So I'm not asking you to lie.

608
01:08:50.394 --> 01:08:55.064
I'm simply asking you to peel
one layer back for the truth.

609
01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.236
- I'm afraid I cannot
comply with that request.

610
01:09:00.637 --> 01:09:03.139
- Well. you will comply.
and it's an order. Colonel.

611
01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:18.188
You wouldn't disobey an
order. would you. Colonel?

612
01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:22.992
- No. sir. I will comply
with your request.

613
01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.434
- Very well. then. you
can have your transfer

614
01:09:30.434 --> 01:09:32.602
back to headquarters
where you'll be safe.

615
01:09:35.038 --> 01:09:36.039
Dismissed.

616
01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:45.882
- Sir. permission
to speak freely.

617
01:09:50.354 --> 01:09:55.359
Sir. your comments
about my courage.

618
01:09:57.361 --> 01:10:00.697
I served honorably
in the Mexican War.

619
01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.566
I was a medical attendant.

620
01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:06.169
I saw men blown apart in
front of me by cannon fire.

621
01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:09.005
I had their blood on
my clothes for days.

622
01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:12.242
I held men as they
died in my arms crying

623
01:10:12.242 --> 01:10:13.910
for their mothers
or their wives.

624
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:16.179
I have never forgotten
those experiences. sir.

625
01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.882
and I pray God I never do.

626
01:10:20.317 --> 01:10:23.052
- Tell it to the
chaplain. Colonel Peabody.

627
01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.321
I just don't care.

628
01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:28.525
Get out of my sight.

629
01:10:45.409 --> 01:10:46.610
Now I know a lot of people

630
01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:48.445
called me and my
boys guerrillas.

631
01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:53.016
They say we didn't fight
like proper soldiers.

632
01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:55.352
But I come to realize this.

633
01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:59.188
most of these complainers
was not from Dixie.

634
01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:01.725
Most of these
complainers were Yanks.

635
01:11:02.626 --> 01:11:04.794
So what this tells me is.

636
01:11:04.794 --> 01:11:08.231
we must have been doing
a pretty good job.

637
01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:14.203
(somber music)

638
01:11:59.483 --> 01:12:02.118
Rebs got lucky in
Aiken. South Carolina.

639
01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:05.455
'specially Wheeler.

640
01:12:05.489 --> 01:12:08.157
I was a victim of
bad intelligence.

641
01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:12.028
Why wasn't I told about the
number of cannon the enemy had?

642
01:12:12.095 --> 01:12:17.100
I was expecting shells from
two. I received a barrage.

643
01:12:18.502 --> 01:12:22.472
And how could the number on
Wheeler's cavalry be so wrong?

644
01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.675
I was expecting about 100.

645
01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:30.013
and instead ended up facing
about 1.000 cavalry troops.

646
01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:32.048
On the day of the
battle in Aiken.

647
01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:35.385
the officers that supplied
me that intelligence failed.

648
01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.187
It won't happen again.

649
01:12:41.324 --> 01:12:43.860
(somber music)

650
01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:27.564
(upbeat music)

651
01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:49.866
(dramatic music)
