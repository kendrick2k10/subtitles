[female voice] Dear Tamara.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:36.416
you got lucky this time.

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:41.250
I usually play my cards very well.

8
00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:45.666
Never stop looking over your shoulder.

What were you saying?

21
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.041
I was asking
if you are ready for the meetings?

22

‎Hmm. I don't know.

23
00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:04.583
I think it's just a regular in-and-out.
I'm more worried about the board meeting.

24
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.291
Hey. the board meeting
is only happening in a few months.

25
00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:08.750
You don't need to worry about that.

26

They are going to do the right thing.

27
00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:13.166
they're going to vote for you.
you're going to make partner.

28

Yeah.

you just believe in me.
even when I don't believe in myself.

32

Hey. I'll always believe in you.

33

-Clinton.
-Oh no.

[chuckles] No. I love Clinton.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.250
Whatever has upset you is probably
your fault. so what did you do?

44
00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.250
I did nothing.

45
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.166
Tell me more.

that is to me and then…

you. you get it. right?

52
00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:47.750
Well friend. it's not about me.
it's just. you know…

53
00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:50.833
A relationship is about
the two people in it.

54
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:53.208

Before we get going. I'd like to start

66

but it seems like she might be…

67
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.666
-Oh. there you are.
-Hi.

68

-Welcome.
-Thank you.

74
00:04:58.208 --> 00:04:59.125
Right. So…

75
00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.166
It's a really tough
business climate right now.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.916
-Morning. everyone.
-Morning. Isabel.

77
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.625
I don't know if you know this
but a lot of our competitors

78
00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:12.291
have had to shut their doors
over the last few months.

79
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.333
Some have been bought
up by the larger firms.

80
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.250
The economy is shaky
and everybody is cutting costs.

81
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.791
Now…

82
00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:24.250
we've had some casualties along
the way. We've lost some clients.

83
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.375
So if you get any hint

84
00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.333
that our clients are uneasy.
don't hesitate to tell me or Isabel.

85
00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:33.125
We can keep our clients.

86
00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.416
But we cannot do that if we
do not know what they are thinking.

87
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:41.666
How about instead of waiting
for hints. find out if they'd like to…

88
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.083
restructure their deals.

89
00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:45.333
From that. we actually show that we're

90
00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:49.375
one. proactive… two. that we care
not only for their business.

91
00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:50.416
but for them.

92
00:05:51.708 --> 00:05:53.125
I think that's a very good idea.

93
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.583
I think we should implement that.

with him and see if they're still happy.

this is a very big client of ours.

the bigger the floral arrangement.

109

else. I think we're done.

-Good. and you.

-Have yourself a great day.

-Hi.

119
00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:10.666
Welcome to Jo'burg.

120
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.125
I hope you've settled in.

121
00:07:12.208 --> 00:07:14.958
Yes. I still have some
unpacking to do but I'll be good.

122
00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:16.916
Well. as you might have noticed. we've

123
00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:19.416
got some renovations going on here.

124
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.333
I hope you don't
mind sharing an office with Tamara.

125
00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:23.041
No. I don't mind at all.

126
00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:24.500
It'll give us some time to catch up.

127
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:26.333
You know. if you need anything.

128
00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:28.666
and we're not around.
she's the person to talk to.

129
00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:30.791
She's really on the ball

130
00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:32.500
and on her way to becoming partner.

131
00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:35.750
Yeah. actually that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

132
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.791
So. Kenzie

133
00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:43.208
wants to be considered
for partner in the next run.

134
00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:45.250
But she's just started.

135
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.541
Her argument is that.

136
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:49.625
she put the work in. in Durban

137
00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:53.750
and why should she be penalised
just because she is transferred.

138
00:07:54.416 --> 00:07:56.416
I just don't think it is

139
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.833
very realistic for us to be
offering her the partnership yet.

140
00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:03.416
She stands a better chance
in the Durban office but in Jo'burg…

141
00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:05.583
she hasn't put in the work yet.

142
00:08:05.666 --> 00:08:07.416
Well. I'm just telling you how it is.

143
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.708
I'm sure everything will work itself out.

144
00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:15.166
You know. I was thinking of putting
both Kenzie and Tamara on T&T Bank.

145
00:08:15.708 --> 00:08:17.416
I'm hoping that the work
will be challenging enough

146
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.916
for Kenzie to know that

147
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
we do value her as a senior associate.

148
00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:23.625
Oh. I can action that. Anything else?

149
00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:26.708
Just make sure
we don't lose any more clients.

150
00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:28.541
Yes. ma'am.

-Got the flowers.

152
00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:38.291
Baby. I shouldn't have said what I said.

153
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.875
-Can we talk later?
-Sure.

154
00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:43.208

-Alright. bye.

[Tamara sighs]

156
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:54.875
Ah. Martin left me here.

157
00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.541
He said we'll be sharing an office.

158
00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:58.291
No. it's alright.

159
00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:00.791
Oh. orange roses.

160
00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:03.125
-My favourite.
-What?!

161
00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:04.375
Me too.

162
00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:05.875
People don't usually get it.

163
00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.750
I know. it's like a perfect combination
between yellow and red roses. right?

164
00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:12.208
-Yes. exactly.
-[both laugh]

165
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:14.250
So they're from a boyfriend?

166

Uh…

167
00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:18.708
Sorry it's none of my business.

168
00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:21.083
No. it's okay. They are.

169
00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:23.708
He messed up.
So he's trying to fix things.

170

and I'm having a small dinner.

You're welcome to come if you'd like.

-I'd love to.
-Great.

174
00:09:36.916 --> 00:09:39.125
I have meetings all day.

175
00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:41.458
But Rob should be here
with your new laptop.

176
00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:43.750
Yeah. Martin
did mention something like that.

177
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.083
-Alright.
-I hope your meetings go well.

178
00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:48.041
Thank you. Have a good day.

179
00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:49.375
-Thanks.
-Bye.

00:09:54.208 --> 00:09:58.291
‎[soft music playing]

181
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.000
-Hi.
-Hey.

182
00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:35.833
[sighs]

183
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:38.000
Okay.

184
00:10:38.708 --> 00:10:40.958
I should've just waited
just a little bit longer.

185
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:46.208
[tensely] You of all people know
how much I want to make partner.

186
00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:49.166
Hey. baby… I get it.

187
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.750
Baby. I don't want to fight.

188
00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.708
I just wanted to know that

189
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:55.791
you're committed to
this relationship just as I am.

190
00:10:55.875 --> 00:10:58.291
I am committed.

191
00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:01.625
There are just some things
that I need to do for me.

192
00:11:01.708 --> 00:11:04.250
And these things
I need to do are important to me.

193
00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:10.125
You have had the chance
to achieve everything you've wanted.

194
00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:18.208
All I'm asking for…

195
00:11:19.708 --> 00:11:21.541
is for that same chance.

196
00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:25.083
And then. I'm all yours.

197
00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:43.625
[tense music playing]

198
00:12:03.416 --> 00:12:07.083
[sombre music playing]

199
00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:20.333
Wow! Early bird.

200
00:12:20.416 --> 00:12:22.875
Hmm. Well. if
I'm gonna make partner at this firm.

201
00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.000
I'm gonna have to up my game.

202
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.458
Oh. you're… you're running for partner?

203
00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:32.291
Martin and Isabel said
that if I can prove myself.

204
00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:33.375
they'll consider me.

205
00:12:33.458 --> 00:12:34.875
Well that's… that's great.

206
00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:36.666
They give everyone a fair chance.

207
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:39.000
[chuckles] May the best woman win.

208
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.166
We'll use Kenzie.

209
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.875
She's got a good eye for contracts.

210
00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:57.666
she knows how to maneuver clauses
that don't benefit our clients.

211
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.958
But Tamara had already
helped me out with this contract.

212
00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:01.750
Bring Kenzie on board too.

213
00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:03.041
The more eyes. the better.

214
00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:05.500
There's also
that new drug that's rolling out.

215
00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:07.375
We need to update those clauses.

216
00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:10.125
make sure they align with
the regulations from the medical board.

217
00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:15.708
Alright. We'll bring her on board.

218
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.625
-Hello. you.
-Hey.

219
00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:23.000
I could have taken a cab.

220
00:13:23.083 --> 00:13:25.125
Hey. Maybe I just wanted to see your face.

221
00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:28.000
‎Mmh. I'm at work. [giggles] Kenzie?

222
00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:30.666
-Yeah?
-This is my boyfriend.

223
00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:33.833
-Oh. wait!
-Clinton Nkosi.

224
00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:37.958
Oh my gosh! Where the hell have you been?!

225
00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:39.208
I've been around.

226
00:13:39.291 --> 00:13:42.833
Oh. wait. You moved to Durban
and I never heard from you again.

227
00:13:42.916 --> 00:13:44.833
-Yeah.
-Wow. so good to see you.

228
00:13:44.916 --> 00:13:46.916
[giggles] It's so good to see you too.

229
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.250
How's your mom?

230
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.291
-She um. recently passed away.
-Aww.

231
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.041
I'm so sorry to hear that.

232
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.583
She never stopped asking about you though.

233
00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:58.958
-Aww. Mommy.
-Or your cooking.

234
00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:00.916
-[giggles] Oh. well!
-[laughs]

235
00:14:01.458 --> 00:14:03.541
So. you guys know each other?

236
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:06.083
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

237
00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:08.208
We used to stay
at the same building years ago.

238
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:10.458
-and we used to hang out a lot.
-[Tamara] Hmm.

239
00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:13.416
You have one of the good ones. Tamara.

240
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.416
Thank you.

241
00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:17.583
I think we need to catch up
and do lunch some time.

242
00:14:17.666 --> 00:14:19.375
-We should.
-[Clinton] Yeah.

243
00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:20.291
Yeah.

244
00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:22.375
Yeah. I think a catchup
would be great. Let's do that.

245
00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:26.708
Look. I need to rush off to a meeting.

246
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.000
-Okay.
-You be good.

247
00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:30.208
Okay. I'll see you soon. yeah?

248
00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:31.250
-Alright.
-Alright.

249
00:14:32.833 --> 00:14:34.041
Eh. baby look.

250
00:14:34.125 --> 00:14:35.625
you don't have to walk me
all the way to the car.

251
00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:36.666
You sure?

252
00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:41.375
‎[sinister music builds up]

253
00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:45.333
Hey babe. you okay?

254
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.708
-Yes baby. I'm fine. [scoffs]
-Hmm.

255
00:14:48.625 --> 00:14:50.000
I know her. We go way back.

256
00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:51.666
We go… yeah. it's been a long time.

257
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.500
Yeah well.
you guys seemed pretty comfortable.

258
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.666
Well baby. like I said. we go way back.

259
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.041
I mean. I knew her mother.

260
00:14:58.125 --> 00:15:00.666
And her mother
would visit her every few months.

261
00:15:01.208 --> 00:15:02.416
‎-Yeah.
‎-Okay.

262
00:15:03.041 --> 00:15:04.875
Baby. you need to go back to work.

263
00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.083
I need to leave. I'll see you.

264
00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:07.541
-Lovely day.
-Bye.

265
00:15:21.416 --> 00:15:24.166
[upbeat music playing]

266
00:15:26.291 --> 00:15:30.791
He. he… he had this look. right.
that I didn't quite understand.

267
00:15:31.291 --> 00:15:32.208
What look?

268
00:15:32.791 --> 00:15:34.416
A look. you know like… [sighs]

269
00:15:35.375 --> 00:15:37.916
"If you are mine" kind of look.

270
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.625
So you think there's history?

271
00:15:41.125 --> 00:15:42.666
Well. they knew each each other but

272
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.416
long before me. and

273
00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:47.500
they did spend a lot of time together.

274
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.291
I mean. he even met her mom.

275
00:15:50.791 --> 00:15:52.791
Don't you think you're overreacting?

276
00:15:52.875 --> 00:15:54.625
No. hear me out. It's like…

277
00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:56.791
how Clinton always complains
about you and Lawrence.

278
00:15:56.875 --> 00:15:57.916
Okay. that's different.

279
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.833
Okay. Lawrence and I work together and

280
00:15:59.916 --> 00:16:02.458
-we're just friends.
-No. it's exactly the same thing.

281
00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.916
Your friendship with Lawrence
makes Clinton uncomfortable.

282
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.833
Now over the years he's learned
to accept it because he trusts you.

283
00:16:08.916 --> 00:16:10.958
-What are you saying?
-That you need to trust him.

284
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.166
[sighs] I trust him.

285
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.583
It's… her.

286
00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:19.708
Cause she has this…
go-getter thing about her.

287
00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:23.250
Okay. maybe…
try and find out what she's about.

288
00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:25.666
But don't make it
too obvious that you're a bit rattled.

289
00:16:26.416 --> 00:16:29.041
Yeah. I mean. she's coming
to my house later on

290
00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:30.333
for a meeting.

291
00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:31.958
-Okay. that's the perfect time. Just…
-Yeah.

292
00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:33.750
Just be innocent about it.

293
00:16:34.541 --> 00:16:37.583
Don't make her realise that you're
trying to get information from her.

294
00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:41.125
And for the record. babe.

295
00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:43.791
I don't think Clinton would cheat on you.

296
00:16:43.875 --> 00:16:46.166
More especially
with someone you work with. babe.

297
00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:47.958
‎Yeah.

298
00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:50.208
Okay?

299
00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:52.375
[mimics] "Okay?"

300
00:16:52.458 --> 00:16:53.416
‎No. for real.

301
00:16:59.416 --> 00:17:01.125
[Kenzie] You have a beautiful house.

302
00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:02.708
[Tamara] Thank you.

303
00:17:03.458 --> 00:17:05.416
You know. Clinton and I
decided to get this house

304
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.250
before getting married and I must say.

305
00:17:07.875 --> 00:17:08.875
it's going well so far.

306
00:17:10.041 --> 00:17:11.333
So when's the wedding?

307
00:17:11.416 --> 00:17:13.375
Argh! [laughs]

308
00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:15.583
I don't know about that. you know?

309
00:17:15.666 --> 00:17:18.125
I just… I have a lot of things
happening in my life. and

310
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:19.541
work is quite demanding.

311

312
00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:25.458
He's still so cute.

313
00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:27.166
What was that?

314
00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:29.458
Oh. uh… [giggles]

315
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:32.541
I was just saying
you guys look great together.

316
00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:35.916
I'll take that complement
but please don't tell him.

317
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.500
or I'll never hear the end of it.

318
00:17:37.583 --> 00:17:38.833
[both laugh]

319
00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.166
So…

320
00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:44.958
Do you have someone special in your life?

321
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.041
I haven't had anyone in a while.

322
00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:52.250
And are you looking?

323
00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:56.250
You know the last time
I was with someone was

324
00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:59.000
around the time
I used to hang out with Clinton.

325
00:17:59.916 --> 00:18:01.791
But I used to spend
so much time with Clinton

326
00:18:01.875 --> 00:18:05.875
that the guy eventually just…
walked away and ended things.

327
00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.083
You guys must have hung out a lot.

328
00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:09.250
Oh. every day.

329
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.750
We'd just hang out
in his apartment for hours just.

330
00:18:13.833 --> 00:18:15.958
just… talking.

331
00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:18.458
Well. you know… in the big city.

332
00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:21.875
there's a man out there who is looking
for someone exactly like you.

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

‎[sinister music plays]

337
00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:39.083
I'm actually quite interested

338
00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:42.041
to see what you've uncovered
with regards to T&T Bank. and

339
00:18:42.666 --> 00:18:44.041
Harbour Pharmaceuticals.

340
00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:47.083
I do hope it'll be beneficial to…

341
00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:48.541
both their bottom lines.

342
00:18:48.625 --> 00:18:50.333
-especially T&T Bank.
-Hmm.

343
00:18:50.416 --> 00:18:52.333
The Harbour contract was
pretty airtight to begin with.

Yeah.

-Hmm.

351
00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:12.708
‎Babe. you're welcome.
‎[grunting] Hot dogs for dinner. Ooh!

352
00:19:12.791 --> 00:19:14.458
-Ooh!
-Tamara [giggling]

353
00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:16.458
‎[both laugh]

354
00:19:16.541 --> 00:19:18.416
-Hot dogs for dinner.
-Hot dogs for dinner.

355
00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:22.125
‎[sinister music playing]

356
00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:24.958
‎[door slams]

357
00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:34.250
‎[liquid pouring]

358
00:19:38.458 --> 00:19:39.833
-Hey. babe.
-Morning.

359
00:19:39.916 --> 00:19:41.875
-Here you go.
-Ah. thank you. but I can't stay.

360
00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.000
I have a meeting to rush to.

361
00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:44.291
Hmm. All the more for me.

362
00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:45.750
I'll see you.

363
00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:47.291
Have a good day.

364
00:19:47.375 --> 00:19:49.000
Oh. I just remembered.

365
00:19:49.083 --> 00:19:51.166
I'm seeing Kenzie later
for a catchup session.

366
00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.500
Oh. what… what happened to. uh…

367
00:19:54.375 --> 00:19:56.375
all of us. err. having lunch together?

368
00:19:56.458 --> 00:19:58.708
Ah baby. we'll be catching up
on our own stuff.

369
00:19:58.791 --> 00:20:01.250
I didn't think you'd want
to get left out on our conversation.

370
00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:02.375
‎Hmm. wow.

371
00:20:03.416 --> 00:20:04.625
Unless you want to join us?

372
00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:10.250
No. it's actually fine.
I … work's crazy. So. I have a lot to do.

373
00:20:10.333 --> 00:20:12.375
-Okay baby. have a lovely day. yeah.
-You too.

374
00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:14.208
-Bye.
-Bye.

375
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.458
-Speak to me. Lawrence.
-Look. I promise you

376
00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:23.875
things are coming together.

377
00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:26.166
It's just that my diary's
a bit of a mess right now.

378
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.083
So perhaps you should offload
some of your work to Kenzie.

379
00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:32.583
I know Tamara is already working
with you on some of the other clients.

380
00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:34.708
[sighs] I don't know. boss.

381
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.875
Look. if we want to give her
a chance to prove she can be partner.

382
00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.916
we have to give her
something to work with.

383
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.875
But we have to even out the workload.

384
00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:45.583
Kenzie. just in time.

385
00:20:45.666 --> 00:20:48.250
-Lawrence has got some work for you.
-Oh.

386
00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:51.125
Oh yes. Harbour Pharma wanted
to move their meeting forward.

387
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:54.000
Please let Tamara know
there will be a time change.

388
00:20:54.083 --> 00:20:55.916
-Will do.
-Alright. I'll see you guys later.

389
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.125
-Alright.
-Bye.

390
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.750
‎[sinister music playing]

391
00:21:01.625 --> 00:21:02.708
-Got it?
-Yes.

392
00:21:02.791 --> 00:21:03.625
Ah. Thank you.

393
00:21:03.708 --> 00:21:05.166
-Hey. hey.
-Hey you.

394
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.458
Heading out to see a client quickly.

395
00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:08.375
Okay. no problem.
Go. I'll see you in the next meeting.

396
00:21:08.458 --> 00:21:11.166
Yes. there's been some changes
but Kenzie will update you.

397
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.333
-Okay. perfect. Bye.
-Alright. bye.

398
00:21:12.416 --> 00:21:13.958
-You know what to do with these?
-Yes. ma'am.

399
00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:14.875
Bye-bye.

400
00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:23.000
Do you need help with anything?

401
00:21:25.666 --> 00:21:28.333
No. but if you could please
just send me notes from

402
00:21:28.416 --> 00:21:30.500
the commercial contract for T&T Bank.

403
00:21:30.583 --> 00:21:32.250
Yeah. I'm almost finished with it.

404
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:33.708
I'll email it shortly.

405
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:36.958
Great. And Lawrence said
you had a message for me?

406
00:21:37.041 --> 00:21:39.083
Yes. He…

407
00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:41.416
He said you don't need to come
to the meeting with Pharma.

408
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.916
he'll handle that on his own.

409
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.916
That's great. you know? I'll get some time

410
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.208
to do some stuff for my birthday dinner.

411
00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:48.458
‎[eerie music plays]

412
00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:49.375
‎Hmm.

413
00:22:01.583 --> 00:22:04.708
-[Tamara] Is there anything else?
-[woman] I think we're done.

414
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:05.875
Great.

415
00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.500
So we've already handed them this contact.

416
00:22:07.583 --> 00:22:09.833
and they seem pretty happy
with the adjustments. So…

417
00:22:09.916 --> 00:22:11.000
I think we're done.

418
00:22:12.541 --> 00:22:16.250
Um… Just err… one last thing.

419
00:22:16.333 --> 00:22:18.625
No. no. thank you. Kenzie.
we've concluded everything.

420
00:22:18.708 --> 00:22:19.958
And we're done with the meeting.

421
00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:24.000
Um… sorry. there's something
I forgot to mention on page 45.

422
00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:25.625
‎[lady in blue sighs]

423
00:22:28.916 --> 00:22:29.750
But…

424
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.333
Tamara. why didn't you
make mention of this before?

425
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.125
Oh. my apologies.

426
00:22:36.208 --> 00:22:38.041
I have a good team. I'm sure we'll…

427
00:22:38.125 --> 00:22:39.541
we'll get through the contract.

428
00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:41.208
Kenzie?

429
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.416
There is a new regulation that will be
in effect from 1st November.

430
00:22:47.041 --> 00:22:48.208
Right now there's no issue.

431
00:22:48.291 --> 00:22:50.375
but if we don't bring it
to your attention. you might not

432
00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:52.000
be able to plan for it accordingly.

433
00:22:52.791 --> 00:22:54.333
Well. please do tell us more.

434
00:22:55.333 --> 00:22:58.625
[spluttering] But why…
you haven't mentioned this to me.

435
00:22:59.166 --> 00:23:02.083
I really had forgotten. Do forgive me.

436
00:23:03.916 --> 00:23:09.333
[soft music playing]

437
00:23:10.916 --> 00:23:12.541
That was really good. Thank you.

438
00:23:12.625 --> 00:23:14.208
You know I'm really happy to see you.

439
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:16.541
And I think coming to Jo'burg
is really going to pay off.

440
00:23:17.125 --> 00:23:19.125
-I hope so.
-It will. It will.

441
00:23:19.208 --> 00:23:21.250
Look. the money. the big car.

442
00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:24.125
-the big house…
-The husband. the baby.

443
00:23:24.208 --> 00:23:25.875
Yeah. all that will come.

444
00:23:26.458 --> 00:23:29.041
And the nice thing is that you're
working at Fish & Associates.

445
00:23:29.125 --> 00:23:31.000
So that's definitely going to pay off.

446
00:23:31.083 --> 00:23:33.708
I mean. they do know how
to take care of their employees.

447
00:23:34.291 --> 00:23:35.958
-They sure do.
-Ah.

448
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.833
Isn't this crazy?
We spoke about this years ago.

449
00:23:39.416 --> 00:23:43.541
And now. our dreams
are starting to come true for us.

450
00:23:43.625 --> 00:23:45.125
We weren't just big dreamers. huh?

451
00:23:45.708 --> 00:23:47.083
Oh. but we were.

452
00:23:52.208 --> 00:23:54.333
I should get back to work.

453
00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:57.500
-We should do this again some time.
-Yeah. we should.

454
00:23:57.583 --> 00:23:58.541
-Yeah.
-Come here.

455
00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:10.625
I've always wanted to do that.

456
00:24:15.208 --> 00:24:18.208
Ah. ah. Kenzie. no. no. no. wait.

457
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.833
You can't do that. Okay?

458
00:24:21.916 --> 00:24:23.000
I'm in a relationship.

459
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.458
I love Tamara.

460
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.583
You can't be kissing me.

461
00:24:27.541 --> 00:24:28.416
Okay. I'm sorry.

462
00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:30.291
I couldn't help myself.

463
00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:33.125
I kind of thought we had our moment there.

464
00:24:34.541 --> 00:24:35.708
It won't happen again.

465
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.291
‎[tense music playing]

466
00:24:57.291 --> 00:25:00.250
I'm so sorry. everyone. [sighs]

467
00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:03.708
Tamara couldn't make it.

468
00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:05.916
She had a personal errand she had to run.

469
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.708
so she asked me to stand in for her.

470
00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:11.250
Okay. did she

471
00:25:11.333 --> 00:25:14.083
at least give you the documentation
we need for this meeting?

472
00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:15.750
[sighs] Don't worry about it.

473
00:25:15.833 --> 00:25:18.083
I've been working on this
over the past few days.

474
00:25:20.458 --> 00:25:21.291
Okay.

475
00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:23.750
‎[sinister music plays]

476
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.333
Alright. let's begin.

477
00:25:30.541 --> 00:25:35.208
‎[upbeat music plays]

478
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:36.500
‎[phone notification rings]

479
00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:38.041
‎[dial pad tapping]

480
00:25:44.458 --> 00:25:45.833
‎-Hey. bestie.
‎-Eww! [laughs]

481
00:25:45.916 --> 00:25:48.208
Come on! You need to stop
trying to sneak up on me.

482
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:49.458
Actually.

483
00:25:49.541 --> 00:25:52.541
why didn't you tell me you weren't
gonna make it to the meeting at Pharma?

484
00:25:52.625 --> 00:25:55.125
Well because you
said that you didn't need me there.

485
00:25:55.208 --> 00:25:56.750
You had a new agenda and

486
00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:58.291
I didn't need to be there anymore.

487
00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:00.375
No… they moved it up.

488
00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:03.708
I bumped into Kenzie
and asked her to tell you.

489
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.708
You weren't answering your phone.

490
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.041
[scoffs] That's not what she said.

491
00:26:08.125 --> 00:26:10.458
She said that
you said you could handle it.

492
00:26:11.833 --> 00:26:13.625
Oh. at least she came prepared.

493
00:26:15.208 --> 00:26:16.041
‎But hang on…

494
00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:19.708
She came prepared to a meeting
she wasn't meant to be at?

495
00:26:22.458 --> 00:26:24.625
Man. I've got a bad feeling about Kenzie.

496
00:26:26.458 --> 00:26:28.875
You know what happened
in the T&T Bank meeting?

497
00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:30.958
‎-Hmm?
‎-She brought up a regulation

498
00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:32.750
that she hadn't spoken to me about

499
00:26:32.833 --> 00:26:35.416
in front of the client.
which made me look like

500
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.041
a village idiot. and her look like a hero.

501
00:26:39.458 --> 00:26:42.375
And you said
you went to the same university with her.

502
00:26:42.458 --> 00:26:44.583
Yeah. we went to the same university but…

503
00:26:45.083 --> 00:26:47.041
Clinton knows her better. you know.

504
00:26:47.916 --> 00:26:50.333
Apparently. they're old friends.

505
00:26:51.416 --> 00:26:52.750
Now she's…

506
00:26:52.833 --> 00:26:55.583
trying to make partner
at the firm by sabotaging you.

507
00:26:56.333 --> 00:26:57.875
[scoffs] No.

508
00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:02.208
Do you think so?

509
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:05.791
‎But…

510
00:27:09.458 --> 00:27:14.125
[cool jazz playing]

511
00:27:29.291 --> 00:27:30.500
[door knocking]

512
00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:42.333
-Hey.
-Hi.

513
00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:43.375
You came?

514
00:27:43.458 --> 00:27:45.416
Well. I had to honour the invite.

515
00:27:46.458 --> 00:27:48.458
Gosh. this is a stunning house.

516
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:49.875
-It's beautiful. right?
-Yeah.

517
00:27:49.958 --> 00:27:52.125
I would love to take
the credit for all of this.

518
00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:53.125
but I must say I…

519
00:27:53.875 --> 00:27:56.666
I wanna say thank you to my
beautiful wife for making it what it is.

520
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.375
I'm Lloyd. Tamara's dad.

521
00:27:58.458 --> 00:28:00.375
I'm Kenzie. It's great to meet you.

522
00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:05.125
Likewise. I love meeting uh.
Tamara's friends and colleagues.

523
00:28:05.875 --> 00:28:08.041
In another time. I would
have loved to be a lawyer.

524
00:28:08.125 --> 00:28:09.208
‎Yeah? [laughs]

525
00:28:09.291 --> 00:28:10.583
‎-Yes.
‎-Really?

526
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.791
-Thank you
-Okay. my darling.

527
00:28:17.541 --> 00:28:18.416
What are you doing here?

528
00:28:18.916 --> 00:28:20.458
You invited me.

529
00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:23.250
You know.
it's so good to get out of my house.

530
00:28:24.458 --> 00:28:25.333
Happy birthday.

531
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:40.208
That looks amazing but before
anybody touches anything…

532
00:28:42.416 --> 00:28:44.541
I'd like to thank all of you

533
00:28:44.625 --> 00:28:47.291
for coming by to celebrate
my birthday dinner with me.

534
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:49.666
You're like family.

535
00:28:51.208 --> 00:28:52.166
Dad.

536
00:28:53.541 --> 00:28:55.916
Mom. [giggles]

537
00:28:56.458 --> 00:28:58.041
I love you both so much and

538
00:28:58.125 --> 00:28:59.250
thank you for being who you are.

539
00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.166
I know you all want me to break
into this big speech but I won't. So…

540
00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:05.791
Let's eat. I didn't cook so it's good.

541
00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:07.000
‎[all laugh]

542
00:29:07.083 --> 00:29:08.375
Here you go. Mommy.

543
00:29:08.458 --> 00:29:09.666
Here you go.

544
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.083
Oh. thank you. young man.

545
00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:12.250
‎[all laugh]

546
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.583
Please pass me. I need that.

547
00:29:14.666 --> 00:29:15.500
‎Thank you.

548
00:29:19.583 --> 00:29:21.166
So err. Kenzie…

549
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.416
is the food edible at least?

550
00:29:24.458 --> 00:29:28.250
I mean. my wife.
she's an awesome cook but I.

551
00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:31.291
I did suggest that we hire a private chef.

552
00:29:31.791 --> 00:29:35.500
and I think Clinton here decided that
he wanted to help with the cooking. So…

553
00:29:36.416 --> 00:29:39.000
if it doesn't go down that well.
you know that it's him.

554
00:29:39.583 --> 00:29:41.208
Wow. really?

555
00:29:41.958 --> 00:29:44.750
No. the food is great. Thank you.

556
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.375
Mrs. Oliphant. Clinton.
you did a great job.

557
00:29:49.458 --> 00:29:54.666
It's a little better than someone's
famous hotdog rolls. I must say.

558
00:29:55.208 --> 00:29:58.500
If you ate Tamara's hotdog
and live to tell the tale then.

559
00:29:59.125 --> 00:30:01.166
you definitely belong with us
because we are the only species

560
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.416
who can actually eat her food. [laughs]

561
00:30:03.958 --> 00:30:05.750
‎Really? You are dead.

562
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.375
Is my daughter still
on track to making partner?

563
00:30:09.458 --> 00:30:13.125
Okay. okay. Mom.
I thought we don't discuss business

564
00:30:13.208 --> 00:30:14.083
on the dinner table.

565
00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:15.208
Okay.

566
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.416
So…

567
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.166
what was Tamara like as a child?

568
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.250
She was such a sweet child.

569
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.541
-Inquiring mind.
-True story.

570
00:30:24.625 --> 00:30:26.125
Always fighting for the rights of others.

571
00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:27.458
Hmm.

572
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:29.875
-That's my friend.
-[Dad] That's my girl.

573
00:30:29.958 --> 00:30:32.541
Yeah. I remember one day
we got called into the school.

574
00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:36.541
-She must have been around ten years old.
-[Tamara] Here we go.

575
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.708
Some of her fellow classmates
were getting punished

576
00:30:42.208 --> 00:30:44.000
for making noise while
the teacher was away.

577
00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:48.416
So somebody secretly
wrote all the names down.

578
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.166
Hmm. when the teacher got back.

579
00:30:50.833 --> 00:30:53.000
this learner gave the list to the teacher.

580
00:30:53.916 --> 00:30:56.625
Mind you. her name was not on the list.

581
00:30:56.708 --> 00:30:58.000
[all] Of course.

582
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.666
But she felt it unfair

583
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:07.208
that they were not warned
someone was secretly writing names down.

584
00:31:08.083 --> 00:31:10.375
Aww child. she was prepared

585
00:31:10.958 --> 00:31:12.208
-to get suspended…
-Yes!

586
00:31:12.291 --> 00:31:15.125
-…fighting for her fellow classmates.
-Aluta!

587
00:31:15.208 --> 00:31:18.000
[all laughing]

588
00:31:18.083 --> 00:31:20.541
Sorry. sir. I need some water.

589
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.666
I'll come with you. I need some water too.

590
00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:30.000
‎[door hinges squeaks]

591
00:31:34.458 --> 00:31:37.083
Kenzie. [whispering]
what the hell are you doing?!

592
00:31:37.166 --> 00:31:38.500
[Kenzie] I'm falling for you.

593
00:31:39.875 --> 00:31:41.250
-Excuse me.
-[seat drags]

594
00:31:42.833 --> 00:31:44.833
We are friends. Friends!

595
00:31:47.125 --> 00:31:48.208
‎[door opens]

596
00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:50.500
‎[sighs]

597
00:31:52.458 --> 00:31:53.666
Is everything okay?

598
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:54.875
[grunts] Baby.

599
00:31:54.958 --> 00:31:57.916
[sighs] Yeah. everything's okay. babe.

600
00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:00.375
-You got your water?
-Hmm!

601
00:32:01.416 --> 00:32:03.208
‎[whispering] Yes baby. I did.

602
00:32:03.958 --> 00:32:04.791
Kenzie?

603
00:32:06.666 --> 00:32:08.500
[sighs] Yes.

604
00:32:10.291 --> 00:32:11.291
Thank you.

605
00:32:12.541 --> 00:32:15.833
-Great then. I'll see you at the table.
-Yes. baby.

606
00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:17.833
‎[Clinton breaths heavily]

607
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:31.875
Mmh. it smells good in the house.

608
00:32:31.958 --> 00:32:33.541
-I hope you'll like it.
-[Tamara giggles]

609
00:32:34.041 --> 00:32:36.625
-You want some coffee?
-Yes please. baby.

610
00:32:36.708 --> 00:32:38.166
‎[phone buzzes]

611
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.291
Thanks. babe.

612
00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:41.916
‎[notification rings]

613
00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:44.291
So do you have a lot of meetings today?

614
00:32:52.541 --> 00:32:54.250
-Earth to Clinton.
-[dial pad clicks]

615
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:56.083
Babe?

616
00:32:56.916 --> 00:32:59.416
-Can you hear me?
-Sorry. Sorry. love. What was that?

617
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.583
I was asking if you had a busy day today.

618
00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:03.500
‎[notification rings again]

619
00:33:05.666 --> 00:33:08.041
‎-[Clinton] Um…
‎-[several notifications]

620
00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:13.625
Is everything okay?

621
00:33:13.708 --> 00:33:14.500
‎[tense music plays]

622
00:33:14.583 --> 00:33:15.875
‎And who is that?

623
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:18.833
It's Kenzie.

624
00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:24.375
‎[sighs]

625
00:33:24.916 --> 00:33:26.625
-She's been trying--
-Babe. actually…

626
00:33:26.708 --> 00:33:28.833
You know what? You don't have to tell me.

627
00:33:33.083 --> 00:33:34.500
‎[notification rings again]

628
00:33:59.083 --> 00:34:01.041
‎[light traffic]

629
00:34:01.125 --> 00:34:02.375
‎[footsteps approaching]

630
00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:06.708
Hey. Kenzie.

631
00:34:06.791 --> 00:34:08.625
Hello. Excuse me.

632
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.958
You've been here for a while now.

633
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.041
Have you found your rhythm yet?

634
00:34:14.125 --> 00:34:15.875
-Um…
-[Isabel chuckles]

635
00:34:16.416 --> 00:34:17.333
You know.

636
00:34:17.416 --> 00:34:20.000
I have been meaning to
talk to you for some time now.

637
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.208
It seems some
of your colleagues and clients

638
00:34:23.291 --> 00:34:25.083
have been very impressed by you.

639
00:34:26.208 --> 00:34:30.375
So does that. um. bring me
closer to being partner?

640
00:34:31.458 --> 00:34:33.750
Wow. [chuckles]

641
00:34:33.833 --> 00:34:35.208
You don't hold back. do you?

642
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:40.208
Look. I don't like
to string people along so

643
00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:41.416
I'll give you this…

644
00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:44.541
Tamara will probably
make partner in this round.

645
00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:47.500
Once you have built
a better rapport with your clients.

646
00:34:47.583 --> 00:34:48.458
so will you.

647
00:34:48.958 --> 00:34:49.875
In the next round.

648
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:51.875
I understand.

649
00:34:53.208 --> 00:34:54.208
Good.

650
00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:56.333
-Lawrence.
-Hey.

651
00:34:58.583 --> 00:34:59.625
What was that all about?

652
00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:01.916
Nothing. Just…

653
00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:04.583
Nothing. I have to go.

654
00:35:15.958 --> 00:35:20.208
[sinister music playing]

655
00:35:20.291 --> 00:35:23.041
‎[keyboard keys clicking]

656
00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:09.625
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

657
00:36:09.708 --> 00:36:11.208
I appreciate it. And this?

658
00:36:11.291 --> 00:36:13.083
Oh. no child. those aren't for you.

659
00:36:13.166 --> 00:36:14.333
-Kenzie.
-Hey.

660
00:36:14.416 --> 00:36:15.583
Surprise!

661
00:36:19.833 --> 00:36:21.791
[chuckling] Oh. wow.

662
00:36:21.875 --> 00:36:25.166
-Are those from your ex?
-[exclaims]

663
00:36:29.958 --> 00:36:33.083
I'm just so glad
that things are going well for you.

664
00:36:36.833 --> 00:36:38.500
Can't wait to see you.

665
00:36:39.041 --> 00:36:41.875
Love… C.

666
00:36:45.375 --> 00:36:46.666
[receptionist] C.

667
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.791
C…Thank you.

668
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.500
‎C.

669
00:36:59.708 --> 00:37:01.041
-Good day.
-Hello.

670
00:37:01.125 --> 00:37:02.416
How are you?

671
00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:05.291
-Take your seats.
-Thank you.

672
00:37:06.875 --> 00:37:08.416
Oh. Good day. everyone.

673
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.000
-Hi. everyone.
-Everyone is here.

674
00:37:12.125 --> 00:37:13.000
Okay.

675
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
You may begin.

676
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:20.000
I'd like to thank my team
who worked tirelessly

677
00:37:20.083 --> 00:37:23.208
for us to be here today. and T&T Bank.

678
00:37:23.291 --> 00:37:25.166
Thank you for giving us
the information we needed

679
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.250
promptly for us to be here today.

680
00:37:27.916 --> 00:37:31.250
So. our strategy for today.

681
00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:33.625
we want to make sure that T&T Bank

682
00:37:33.708 --> 00:37:36.083
is the most compliant bank in Africa.

683
00:37:36.166 --> 00:37:39.666
Yes. we know there have been
some hurdles in the banking industry

684
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:41.166
but we have solutions.

685
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.666
We know what
the problem is. and that's banking--

686
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.458
Yeah. that. What that means--

687
00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:46.458
I'm so sorry.

688
00:37:46.958 --> 00:37:47.833
He just couldn't wait.

689
00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:49.666
I need to see you. Now.

690
00:37:55.541 --> 00:37:57.416
-You know what's going on?
-I have no idea.

691
00:38:15.666 --> 00:38:16.666
I don't understand.

692
00:38:17.708 --> 00:38:19.291
Tamara sent me that email.

693
00:38:19.375 --> 00:38:22.000
basically advising me as my legal counsel

694
00:38:22.083 --> 00:38:24.416
to take an offer from W&K Law Associates.

695
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.333
instead of renewing my contract with you.

696
00:38:26.416 --> 00:38:27.541
This doesn't make sense.

697
00:38:29.166 --> 00:38:31.583
Okay. You know what. we will investigate.

698
00:38:31.666 --> 00:38:33.458
I have chosen to stay with this firm

699

my loyalties are misplaced.

So. you knew nothing about this?

703
00:38:46.333 --> 00:38:48.500
In other words. she went behind your back.

704
00:38:50.291 --> 00:38:51.125
I want her fired.

705
00:38:51.958 --> 00:38:53.208
Or I'm taking my business elsewhere.

706
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:55.583
There are due processes that we need to--

Consider her gone.

we need to follow.

Get rid of her.

Well. he wants you off his account.

And if we don't fire you.

727

he's threatened to take
his business to another firm.

728

-What?! Why?
-Because he doesn't trust you anymore.

and I can confirm

846
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:47.083
that the email was sent
from Tamara's laptop.

847
00:49:47.666 --> 00:49:49.625
Yeah. but do you have proof
that Tamara was

848
00:49:49.708 --> 00:49:52.000
the one who actually
typed and sent that email?

849
00:49:52.083 --> 00:49:56.333
Well I can prove that
the email was sent from these premises

850
00:49:56.416 --> 00:49:58.750
at the same time that
her car was parked here

851
00:49:58.833 --> 00:50:00.833
because she swiped in
at the security gate.

852
00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:04.958
So. the likelihood that
she sent the email is very high.

discrepancies in this email?

873
00:51:15.583 --> 00:51:17.291
What is your next move. babe?

874
00:51:22.625 --> 00:51:23.458
I don't know.

875
00:51:27.041 --> 00:51:30.791
Hey… OMG! Thando.

876
00:51:30.875 --> 00:51:32.000
‎Hey.

877
00:51:32.083 --> 00:51:33.208
I see what's happening here.

878
00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:35.958
You only ever come
to my place if T is here.

879
00:51:36.458 --> 00:51:39.208
-That's not right. [laughs]
-You got me.

880
00:51:39.291 --> 00:51:41.916
-So good to see you.
-Oh. same here.

881
00:51:44.208 --> 00:51:45.083
Hey. T.

882
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:53.750
-Is everything okay?
-I spoke to Isabel and Martin.

883
00:51:54.458 --> 00:51:56.291
They called me into a meeting with Robert.

884
00:51:56.916 --> 00:51:58.666
I told them I'd deliver the findings

885
00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.000
-from the investigation myself.
-Great.

886
00:52:01.625 --> 00:52:03.083
And what are the findings?

887
00:52:03.708 --> 00:52:06.958
T. the email definitely
comes from your laptop.

888
00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:10.416
and this happened at the time
when you were checked into the premises.

889
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:15.375
So they'll start with formal
termination of employment.

890
00:52:15.458 --> 00:52:17.625
then call you in for an exit interview.

891
00:52:18.875 --> 00:52:19.958
I'm so sorry.

892
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.375
‎So…

893
00:52:25.416 --> 00:52:26.625
‎Didn't…

894
00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:42.625
‎[door knocking]

895
00:52:50.375 --> 00:52:51.208
Kenzie.

896
00:52:51.875 --> 00:52:54.208
I figured you'd be hungry at some point.

897
00:52:54.291 --> 00:52:55.875
You shouldn't have. I mean. you know that

898
00:52:55.958 --> 00:52:57.291
I can cook for myself. right?

899
00:52:57.375 --> 00:52:58.666
Yes. but…

900
00:52:59.375 --> 00:53:02.416
where's the fun in eating by yourself?

901
00:53:04.166 --> 00:53:05.208
Can I come in?

902
00:53:09.291 --> 00:53:11.125
No man should be by himself.

903
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:15.708
Especially when
there's a woman around.

904
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.666
Kenzie. Kenzie. Kenzie.
we spoke about this.

905
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:21.791
‎[laughs]

906
00:53:21.875 --> 00:53:23.083
No need to be so uptight.

907
00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:25.083
-Why are you so cheery?
-Ah!

908
00:53:25.166 --> 00:53:27.583
Because I…

909
00:53:27.666 --> 00:53:29.500
think I can actually get the next thing

910
00:53:29.583 --> 00:53:31.916
on my list of things
I've been working towards.

911
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.250
What list is this?

912
00:53:34.041 --> 00:53:35.541
[sighs] Clinton.

913

‎[plates clinking]

914
00:53:42.708 --> 00:53:43.916
Move to Jo'burg.

915
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.416
make partner at the firm.

916
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.250
get married. buy a house.

917
00:53:50.916 --> 00:53:51.916
have a baby.

918
00:53:53.666 --> 00:53:54.916
I've got two things done.

919
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:58.958
And the next one is so
close I can actually taste it.

920
00:54:00.791 --> 00:54:01.875
So you've made partner?

921
00:54:02.958 --> 00:54:04.833
Huh. Tamara has been fired.

922
00:54:05.708 --> 00:54:08.291
I'm the only one still
in the running for the position.

923
00:54:09.333 --> 00:54:10.833
I made sure of that.

924
00:54:10.916 --> 00:54:11.875
You made sure of it?

925
00:54:11.958 --> 00:54:15.625
[chuckles] Clinton.
you like playing stupid.

926
00:54:16.541 --> 00:54:18.041
There's no way I would have
been able to make partner

927
00:54:18.125 --> 00:54:20.333
with Tamara in the picture. [sighs]

928
00:54:20.416 --> 00:54:23.541
And it just so happens
that things worked in my favour.

929
00:54:26.791 --> 00:54:29.458
Sweet little Tamara with her…

930
00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:32.583
perfect mom and dad

931
00:54:32.666 --> 00:54:35.750
and her perfect job and her perf…

932
00:54:37.208 --> 00:54:38.583
And her perfect partner.

933
00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:42.500
Why can't I have what she has?

934
00:54:45.166 --> 00:54:46.166
‎[Clinton clears throat]

935
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:48.166
Because everything happens the way

936
00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:50.416
it should at its own time.

937
00:54:51.625 --> 00:54:53.041
[laughs]

938
00:54:54.125 --> 00:54:57.000
You know. it's really cute
that you believe that.

939
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.500
I need the bathroom.

Pick up!

[phone hangs up]

947
00:56:25.708 --> 00:56:27.750
-That was quick.
-Yep.

948
00:56:28.333 --> 00:56:30.791
[sighs deeply] See?

949
00:56:31.416 --> 00:56:33.291
I told you it won't be long
until I'm married.

950
00:56:33.375 --> 00:56:34.875
What the hell are you doing?

951
00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:37.291
Take that off. Kenzie!

952
00:56:38.416 --> 00:56:40.041
-How dare you?
-Okay. um…

953
00:56:40.833 --> 00:56:42.375
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--
-Ah.

954
00:56:42.458 --> 00:56:44.666
-my goodness.
-I didn't mean to upset you.

955
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:50.000
I'm going to ask you to leave. Now.

956
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:05.416
Please leave.

957
00:57:14.958 --> 00:57:16.916

Hey. Lawrence. It's Clinton. I'm outside.

964
00:57:57.541 --> 00:57:58.875
It's urgent. we need to talk.

965
00:58:06.125 --> 00:58:07.958
-Hi.
-Hi.

966
00:58:09.458 --> 00:58:11.041
Um. Mart… yeah. you can take a seat.

967
00:58:13.291 --> 00:58:15.875
Oh. Tamara.

968
00:58:15.958 --> 00:58:20.250
Oh. it is so good to see you.

969
00:58:20.791 --> 00:58:21.708
[huffs]

970
00:58:22.583 --> 00:58:25.416
I'm just rushing off to
a meeting with T&T Bank. I…

971
00:58:27.166 --> 00:58:28.375
I'm sorry.

972

[sighs]

973
00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:32.125
You don't have to worry about it.

974
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:36.166
The truth always comes to light.

975
00:58:37.375 --> 00:58:40.291
‎Oh. sweetheart.

976
00:58:41.041 --> 00:58:44.291
You really think the truth is
what's going to solve your case?

977
00:58:46.125 --> 00:58:48.750
[scoffs] I think it's best to just…

978
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:51.375
move on and start over.

979
00:58:52.666 --> 00:58:54.625
-Tamara.
-I have to go.

980
00:59:01.583 --> 00:59:04.625
Rob. I need you to pull up
footage from 2nd March.

981
00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:07.208
specifically the boardroom.
But even if it's from the corridor.

982
00:59:07.291 --> 00:59:09.208
Of course. of course. Uh…

983
00:59:10.291 --> 00:59:13.000
-You just need to complete this form…
-What is this?

984
00:59:13.083 --> 00:59:15.083
…before I can pull out
any footage for you.

985
00:59:19.833 --> 00:59:22.958
So you basically need
a signature from a name partner?

986
00:59:23.041 --> 00:59:25.875
It's protocol. man.
So you get me that signature.

987
00:59:25.958 --> 00:59:27.250
and I'll get you that footage.

988
00:59:28.958 --> 00:59:29.791
Alright.

989
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.541
You know. we're really
disappointed about the outcome

990
00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:37.291
of this investigation.

991
00:59:38.791 --> 00:59:40.875
The investigation found what it found.

992
00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:44.583
It doesn't necessarily make it true.

993
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:48.166
We wish you the best.

994
00:59:48.833 --> 00:59:51.583
Then. I guess the bad guys win.

995
00:59:52.166 --> 00:59:55.041
-Tamara.
-It's a pity.

996
00:59:56.166 --> 00:59:57.458
Well. thank you.

997
01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:10.458
[sad music playing]

998
01:00:16.208 --> 01:00:20.333
[sighs] I went in
for my exit interview today.

999
01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:21.833
I'm sorry. friend.

1000
01:00:21.916 --> 01:00:25.083
[exhales] Babe. that's why I asked
to meet with you here.

1001
01:00:25.583 --> 01:00:27.375
When this whole thing started with

1002
01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:29.666
Kenzie. I decided to dig around

1003
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.208
and I found some interesting things. Tams.

1004
01:00:33.125 --> 01:00:35.458
You are not the first person
this is happening to.

1005
01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:37.583
There's another woman.

1006
01:00:38.208 --> 01:00:40.541
-Another woman?
-She'll tell you her story.

1007
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.333
Ah. Thanks for

1008
01:00:43.416 --> 01:00:44.458
-coming.
-Hi.

1009
01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.125
Ah. not an issue. I was in town.

1010
01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:49.000
Tamara. this is Michelle.

1011
01:00:49.083 --> 01:00:50.750
‎-Lovely to meet you.
‎-Likewise.

1012
01:00:51.916 --> 01:00:53.833
I asked her to come

1013
01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:57.083
and give you her story.
and see if she can help in any way.

1014
01:00:58.166 --> 01:01:00.416
Of course. Um…

1015
01:01:02.416 --> 01:01:05.625
Kenzie used to work
with my ex-husband. Mile.

1016
01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:07.250
and she was our lawyer.

1017
01:01:08.625 --> 01:01:10.500
We became friends quickly.

1018
01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:14.916
She spent a lot of time
at our house on business.

1019
01:01:16.458 --> 01:01:18.833
Huh. We clicked.

1020
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.791
Now she became my best friend.

1021
01:01:23.916 --> 01:01:26.708
Then I found out
that she was texting my husband.

1022
01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:28.833
And they started meeting

1023
01:01:28.916 --> 01:01:30.541
without me.

1024
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:33.875
That's when I…

1025
01:01:35.166 --> 01:01:37.583
knew that something
was going horribly wrong.

1026
01:01:38.125 --> 01:01:39.333
At that point I knew--

1027
01:01:39.416 --> 01:01:41.208
You don't have to share everything.

1028
01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:44.750
I do.

1029
01:01:45.958 --> 01:01:47.750
It happened so quickly.

1030
01:01:49.833 --> 01:01:51.416
I fell ill.

1031
01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:56.041
Turns out I was 11 weeks pregnant.

1032
01:01:59.333 --> 01:02:00.875
Kenzie wanted my life.

1033
01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:06.791
I stood no chance.

1034
01:02:07.416 --> 01:02:10.125
I was being pushed out
on the business I just started.

1035
01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:13.500
I miscarried at sixteen weeks.

1036
01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:17.875
Kenzie had…

1037
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:22.208
flowers and a card delivered to me

1038
01:02:23.916 --> 01:02:25.083
that read um…

1039
01:02:26.416 --> 01:02:28.541
"You do not deserve to carry his child.

1040
01:02:29.583 --> 01:02:30.750
I should instead."

1041
01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:33.875
‎[Michelle sighs]

1042
01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:40.250
In a nutshell.

1043
01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.375
I would stay far away from her.

1044
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:50.875
She creeps into your life and
when you're not watching.

1045
01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:52.583
she strikes.

1046
01:02:54.958 --> 01:02:56.250
Don't let her win.

Sure.

1063
01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:21.125
[Clinton] I didn't realize how much
I loved you. until everything fell apart.

1064

Look. I know that

1065

things might not work out between us.

1067
01:04:27.416 --> 01:04:29.916
Tamara. is you thinking
that I cheated on you

1068

with Kenzie because I did not.

1069

You know. a lot

1074
01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:48.666
has happened in these
past couple of weeks.

1075
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:51.583
And things that made me
question myself and

1076

things I managed to get answers for.

1077
01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:57.875

1078
01:04:58.666 --> 01:05:00.000
sometimes

1079
01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:04.583

to people who don't deserve it. [sobs]

1080

you have to face the face
of adversity and I run.

I don't know why I do it. but I do it.

I ran when you proposed to me.

1085
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.083
I ran when things got rough. but

moved to another city and…

1111

so there's a chance to just speak
to her husband and get some closure.

01:16:52.625 --> 01:16:55.000
‎Argh! [shouts]

1226
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:57.833
‎[grunts]

1227
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
‎Fuck!

1228
01:17:03.541 --> 01:17:07.250
‎[breathes heavily]

01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:25.291
‎Come on! [hisses]

1231
01:17:27.625 --> 01:17:29.416
‎[sighs] Hi.

1232
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:34.833
‎Hi. I'd like to order
‎a mild chicken and chips. please.

1233
01:17:35.583 --> 01:17:39.750
Delivery?
Yes. my number is. zero-eight-three.

1234
01:18:09.208 --> 01:18:10.458
‎Lawrence?

1235
01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:14.791
‎[suspenseful music playing]

1236
01:18:15.333 --> 01:18:16.583
‎[Tamara] Oh my God. Lawrence!

‎-[Kenzie] Chill!

1240
01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.125
Gee-whizz!

1241
01:18:56.208 --> 01:18:58.583
Hey. [grunts] Oh. Woah!

1242
01:19:01.291 --> 01:19:02.208
I know you did it.

1243
01:19:03.125 --> 01:19:04.625
I don't know what you're talking about.

1244
01:19:04.708 --> 01:19:06.375
I need you to leave my house.

1245
01:19:07.333 --> 01:19:09.875
You framed me so I'll get fired.

1246
01:19:09.958 --> 01:19:12.416
You lied about Clinton and the worst one.

1247
01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:14.625
‎is what you did to Lawrence.

1248
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:16.583
‎Hmm.

1249
01:19:17.541 --> 01:19:19.083
And if you don't leave my house.

1250
01:19:19.958 --> 01:19:21.583
‎you will end up like Lawrence.

1251
01:19:21.666 --> 01:19:23.625
‎-[yelps]
‎-Don't mention his name!

1252
01:19:24.125 --> 01:19:26.416
‎[laughs mockingly]

1253
01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.041
‎Tamara.

1254
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:31.791
You think you had it. didn't you?

1255
01:19:32.791 --> 01:19:34.000
‎[both grunts]

1256
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.541
‎You're not going to ruin my life!
‎Not now. not ever!

1257
01:19:41.625 --> 01:19:43.250
‎No!

1258
01:19:48.916 --> 01:19:51.166
‎Die. bitch. Die!

1259
01:19:54.583 --> 01:19:57.041
‎-[Kenzie choking]
‎-[Tamara grunting]

1260
01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:01.750
‎[box dropping]

01:20:06.333 --> 01:20:09.125
‎[Kenzie coughing]

1262
01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:13.625
‎What's this?

1263
01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:14.875
Put that down!

1264
01:20:14.958 --> 01:20:16.166
Why do you have a picture of my father?

1265
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:17.875
-That is not your father.
-[shouting] This is my father!

1266
01:20:19.833 --> 01:20:22.583
‎[pants]

1267
01:20:22.666 --> 01:20:24.625
Is he a part of your next scheme?

1268
01:20:25.125 --> 01:20:26.541
Hmm? Is he a target?

1269
01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:28.916
Now. you listen to me.

1270
01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:32.583
If you do
anything to my parents… Anything!

1271
01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:35.791
[panting] I will kill you myself.

1272
01:20:40.708 --> 01:20:41.875
‎[door bangs]

1273
01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:06.375
‎[police walkie talkie chatter]

1274
01:21:08.583 --> 01:21:10.125
‎Martin. what's going on?

1275
01:21:13.333 --> 01:21:14.166
‎Rob.

1276
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.291
They found his body
this morning in the server room.

1277
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:20.375
Looks like he was strangled.

1278
01:21:22.041 --> 01:21:25.041
I went to see him about
an invoice I was sent about

1279
01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:27.875
pulling footage from one
of our external servers.

1280
01:21:29.375 --> 01:21:31.750
It wasn't supposed to happen like that.

1281
01:21:33.208 --> 01:21:34.041
What?

1282
01:21:38.041 --> 01:21:39.291
Lawrence has been shot.

1283
01:21:40.166 --> 01:21:41.791
He's in critical condition right now.

1284
01:21:42.625 --> 01:21:45.291
But I'm sure Kenzie
has something to do with it.

1285
01:21:48.875 --> 01:21:50.875
How could Kenzie be involved?

1286
01:21:51.541 --> 01:21:52.875
Can I please see my laptop?

1287
01:21:52.958 --> 01:21:54.416
You handed it in when you left.

1288
01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.833
Yes. but I gave it to Rob.

1289
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.583
Lawrence had said to me in
our last conversation.

1290
01:21:58.666 --> 01:22:01.541
that he had found some information
that would clear my name.

1291
01:22:02.166 --> 01:22:04.125
-Did he send you anything?
-No.

1292
01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:07.875
I know he would have
sent something to you.

1293
01:22:08.375 --> 01:22:10.666
There's nothing here from
Lawrence. maybe to Isabel.

1294
01:22:12.375 --> 01:22:13.291
Tamara.

1295
01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:15.416
I just heard what happened.

1296
01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.750
It's been a crazy night.

1297
01:22:18.291 --> 01:22:19.125
Wait.

1298
01:22:22.041 --> 01:22:22.875
Come and see this.

1299
01:22:27.083 --> 01:22:28.208
‎[Tamara breathing heavily]

1300
01:22:29.708 --> 01:22:32.333
What… what if Kenzie
found this footage too.

1301
01:22:32.416 --> 01:22:33.916
-and then she's--
-Okay. alright.

1302
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.750
We need to take this to the police.

1303
01:22:36.791 --> 01:22:37.791
I'm sorry. Tamara.

1304
01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:41.708
So now that we have
the recordings. I think

1305
01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:43.750
we're in a much better position to…

1306
01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:46.583
I just…
I don't understand how we didn't see this.

1307
01:22:46.666 --> 01:22:48.166
We can handle… Uh. there she is.

1308
01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:49.333
‎-Um…
‎-Uh-huh.

1309
01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:53.125
-[ominous tune playing]
-Morning.

1310
01:22:53.208 --> 01:22:54.125
[receptionist] Hi.

1311
01:22:54.208 --> 01:22:57.333
We are looking for Kenzie Myeni
and Tamara Oliphant.

1312
01:22:57.416 --> 01:22:58.375
[police walkie talkie chatter]

1313
01:22:58.458 --> 01:23:00.291
Hi. Officer. I'm Tamara.

1314
01:23:02.125 --> 01:23:04.250
We'd like to take you in for questioning.

1315
01:23:05.166 --> 01:23:06.041
Me?

1316
01:23:07.958 --> 01:23:08.875
What…

1317
01:23:08.958 --> 01:23:11.333
I mean the person you should
be arresting is right next to me.

1318
01:23:11.416 --> 01:23:12.333
Well. ma'am.

1319
01:23:12.416 --> 01:23:14.333
we can discuss the
whole thing at the police station.

1320
01:23:15.375 --> 01:23:18.125
Miss Myeni. we also
found your fingerprints.

1321
01:23:18.208 --> 01:23:19.958
Do you mind
perhaps coming with us to the station?

1322
01:23:20.041 --> 01:23:21.958
Okay. okay. wait. Officer. Martin.

1323
01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:24.291
‎Let's go.

1324
01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:26.666
-Martin.
-This is a mess.

1325
01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.208
So that's when
I went to my friend Lawrence's house.

1326
01:23:33.916 --> 01:23:34.750
I just…

1327
01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:36.875
I needed a break from everything.

1328
01:23:38.083 --> 01:23:40.125
So who can confirm the story?

1329
01:23:40.208 --> 01:23:42.625
That will be my friend Thando and…

1330
01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:45.458
my boyfriend Clinton.
They came to visit me

1331
01:23:45.541 --> 01:23:46.583
a couple of times.

1332
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:56.333
‎[door opens]

1333
01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.333
Kenzie Myeni.

1334
01:23:59.750 --> 01:24:00.833
So tell me.

1335
01:24:01.375 --> 01:24:04.416
where were you between
8:00pm and 10:00pm last night?

1336
01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:06.541
I was at home.

1337
01:24:10.916 --> 01:24:13.250
I ordered food for delivery
at Sunny's Chicken.

1338
01:24:13.333 --> 01:24:15.791
I have the receipt
in my bag if you want to go check.

1339
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:18.791
I will verify that.

1340
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:20.958
So tell me.

1341
01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:24.708
how do you explain
your fingerprints being found

1342
01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:26.791
at the gate with control
at Lawrence's house?

1343
01:24:27.916 --> 01:24:28.958
I mean. it's possible.

1344
01:24:29.708 --> 01:24:31.291
We sometimes leave the office together

1345
01:24:31.375 --> 01:24:33.458
and help each other
carry out things to our cars.

1346
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.958
So there's something
that doesn't add up here. Ms. Myeni.

1347
01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:40.916
It won't add up.

1348
01:24:41.916 --> 01:24:43.833
because I wasn't at the scene of crime.

1349
01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:51.666
There you go.

1350
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:03.833
‎Huh.

1351
01:25:07.916 --> 01:25:08.791
‎[door closing]

1352
01:25:09.333 --> 01:25:10.958
Listen. I know you want
to solve this case.

1353
01:25:11.041 --> 01:25:12.958
but I am not the suspect here.

1354
01:25:15.583 --> 01:25:19.583
Mr. Clinton Nkosi.
just confirmed your story. So…

1355
01:25:20.208 --> 01:25:21.083
you're free to go.

1356
01:25:22.625 --> 01:25:24.958
[sighs] Thank you.

1357
01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:31.000
Can I speak to Kenzie?

1358
01:25:32.083 --> 01:25:34.625
Unfortunately
I can't allow that. So I'm sorry.

1359
01:25:34.708 --> 01:25:37.416
Do you want to solve this case or not?

‎-[door bangs shut]
‎-[scoffs]

1361
01:25:48.583 --> 01:25:49.958
I see you made it out.

1362
01:25:50.458 --> 01:25:52.208
It wasn't difficult.

1363
01:25:52.291 --> 01:25:54.125
‎I did nothing wrong.

1364
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:55.708
Of course.

1365
01:25:56.541 --> 01:25:59.041
You like to colour in between the lines.

1366
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.041
I find that boring.

1367
01:26:02.041 --> 01:26:03.416
Tell me. how long do you think

1368
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.750
it will take
for them to figure you out. hmm?

1369
01:26:07.333 --> 01:26:11.916
You know. they deal
with criminals like you every single day.

1370
01:26:13.791 --> 01:26:15.250
If they were going to charge
me for something.

1371
01:26:15.333 --> 01:26:16.791
they would've done it by now.

1372
01:26:16.875 --> 01:26:19.708
And it still doesn't change the
fact that I didn't murder Lawrence.

1373
01:26:21.083 --> 01:26:22.166
Murder?

1374
01:26:22.666 --> 01:26:24.375
Hmm. isn't what this is all about?

1375
01:26:24.958 --> 01:26:26.041
‎Huh.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:27.833
‎[door opens]

1377
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.291
Kenzie Myeni. you are under arrest.

1378
01:26:36.375 --> 01:26:37.958
for the murder of Robert Abrahams

1379
01:26:38.041 --> 01:26:40.916
and attempted murder of Lawrence.

1380
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.875
I mean. no. no. no! You…

1381
01:26:43.458 --> 01:26:44.791
You don't know what you're talking about.

01:27:00.083 --> 01:27:01.416
Can you sign for me here. please?

1388

Thank you. I will also be a witness.

that you were going through so much?

I'm sorry. Dad.

1394
01:27:22.791 --> 01:27:23.875
-is why she has…
-[bag unzipping]

1395
01:27:25.166 --> 01:27:26.458
She has this picture of you.

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:37.708
[wistful music playing]

1399
01:27:38.416 --> 01:27:39.833
I think I need to see Kenzie.

1400
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:51.833
‎[sighs]

1401
01:27:52.833 --> 01:27:54.916
You're here to fight on
behalf of your daughter?

1402
01:27:55.958 --> 01:27:56.791
No.

1403
01:27:58.333 --> 01:27:59.750
I want to know where you got this.

1404
01:28:02.625 --> 01:28:04.166
Why does it matter where I got it?

1405
01:28:07.416 --> 01:28:08.250
Well. I…

1406
01:28:08.791 --> 01:28:12.666
I gave this picture to somebody
that was very. very special to me and…

1407
01:28:14.166 --> 01:28:15.916
I lost contact with her over the years.

1408
01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:17.375
Juliet.

1409
01:28:19.166 --> 01:28:21.666
She's my mother. Did you know her?

1410
01:28:22.958 --> 01:28:24.125
She… yes.

1411
01:28:24.625 --> 01:28:26.583
It… briefly but yes.

1412
01:28:26.666 --> 01:28:28.333
I did know her. We met and…

1413
01:28:29.166 --> 01:28:32.833
I… had to keep a low profile
from the police at the time.

1414
01:28:33.416 --> 01:28:35.416
Still kept in contact with her. you know.

1415
01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.041
We wrote to each other. but then…

1416
01:28:38.333 --> 01:28:39.416
She just stopped writing.

1417
01:28:40.916 --> 01:28:44.375
Yeah. when she fell pregnant with me
and I think her family disowned her.

1418
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:47.333
They didn't even come to her funeral.

1419
01:28:47.416 --> 01:28:48.541
Funeral?

1420
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:50.958
Sorry.

1421
01:28:51.708 --> 01:28:54.500
[walkie-talkie chatter in background]

1422
01:28:55.083 --> 01:28:57.166
She was married to an asshole of a man

1423
01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:58.791
who abused both of us.

1424
01:29:00.125 --> 01:29:01.416
But it kept the lights on.

1425
01:29:02.875 --> 01:29:03.791
He died.

1426
01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:05.916
In his sleep.

1427
01:29:12.625 --> 01:29:13.958
What do you want from me?

1428
01:29:17.541 --> 01:29:20.291
[laughs] Oh.

1429
01:29:21.625 --> 01:29:23.375
You think you could be my father?

1430
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.583
So you came in here
to clear your conscience.

1431
01:29:27.666 --> 01:29:29.000
What are you expecting. huh?

1432
01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.875
A fairytale family reunion?

1433
01:29:33.791 --> 01:29:35.791
[sobs] I'm not expecting anything. Kenzie.

1434
01:29:35.875 --> 01:29:37.583
Get the fuck out of here!

1435
01:29:38.208 --> 01:29:42.916
You and your fucking daughter!
You think everybody's life is perfect.

1436
01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:47.625
You can go and clear your
fucking conscience in hell… Lloyd!

1437
01:30:00.541 --> 01:30:02.333
It's quite puzzling how

1438
01:30:02.416 --> 01:30:04.416
she'd have a picture of your dad.

1439
01:30:07.208 --> 01:30:08.125
And?

1440
01:30:10.458 --> 01:30:13.250
Dad. did she tell you where she
got a picture of you from?

1441
01:30:13.833 --> 01:30:16.416
[sighs] She… stole it from the house.

1442
01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.541
I knew it.

1443
01:30:18.125 --> 01:30:20.166
But why? Why would she do that?

1444
01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:23.750
I don't know. She didn't say.

1445
01:30:26.541 --> 01:30:27.375
‎Crazy.

1446
01:30:41.083 --> 01:30:42.000
Take a seat.

1447
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.916
Tamara. I owe you an unreserved apology.

1448
01:30:54.791 --> 01:30:56.666
It's okay. you don't have to apologise.

1449
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:58.041
Yes. I do.

1450
01:30:58.125 --> 01:31:00.583
Kenzie's going
to be in jail for a long time.

1451
01:31:01.125 --> 01:31:03.333
An apology is the least I can give you.

1452
01:31:04.958 --> 01:31:06.250
I need you here.

1453
01:31:06.333 --> 01:31:09.291
Would you do me the honour
of taking your job back…

1454
01:31:09.833 --> 01:31:10.708
when you're ready?

1455
01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:13.000
Yes.

1456
01:31:13.625 --> 01:31:16.166
I will take my job back.

1457
01:31:16.791 --> 01:31:18.750
I just need your assurance

1458
01:31:19.625 --> 01:31:22.125
that you will trust how
I handle my clients.

1459
01:31:23.416 --> 01:31:24.250
Done.

1460
01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:28.583
Oh. and…
I have the pleasure to inform you.

1461
01:31:29.416 --> 01:31:31.291
that you are now partner at this law firm.

1462
01:31:34.833 --> 01:31:37.375
Um. thank you. Thank you!

1463
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:39.875
You deserve it.

1464
01:31:41.166 --> 01:31:42.000
‎Yes.

1465
01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:44.916
‎[laughs]

1466
01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:49.416
[warden] Lights out!

1467
