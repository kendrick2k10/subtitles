00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:26.708
Those things down below...

4
00:24:27.166 --> 00:24:28.750
...they have bigger hearts.

5
00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:32.541
You can't beat A.I.

6
00:24:32.916 --> 00:24:35.583
It is evolution.

7
00:30:10.083 --> 00:30:12.666
Go! You must leave...

8
00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:15.041
...Go find Nirmata!

9
00:48:37.666 --> 00:48:39.416
You have six children in your van.

10
00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:41.250
This says you only have five.

11
00:48:43.083 --> 00:48:45.666
I'm sorry I forgot.

12
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.333
My brother's kid
is also traveling with us.

13
00:48:59.625 --> 00:49:00.833
Take your hat off.

14
00:49:02.708 --> 00:49:03.541
Take your hat off.

15
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:34.625
I found the child.

16
00:55:35.083 --> 00:55:36.833
She's with the American.

17
01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:39.916
What's happening?

18
01:13:59.541 --> 01:14:00.708
Where is the child?

19
01:15:30.541 --> 01:15:33.791
Sir. casualties from the NOMAD attack!

20
01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:14.000
The child will save us.

21
01:16:44.416 --> 01:16:46.708
No. She is innocent.

22
01:20:00.208 --> 01:20:01.166
It's me! It's me!

23
01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:05.916
Where is she?

24
01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:01.000
Have you found her?

25
01:21:01.166 --> 01:21:02.291
What happened?

26
01:21:03.583 --> 01:21:04.666
Report back!

27
01:21:06.708 --> 01:21:07.666
Come in!

28
01:21:14.291 --> 01:21:15.750
What is it?

29
01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:17.833
I can't see.

30
01:28:10.375 --> 01:28:11.208
Daw!

31
01:28:11.208 --> 01:28:12.208
Get in!

32
01:28:19.083 --> 01:28:19.958
Let's move.

33
01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:21.208
Let's move!

34
01:28:39.125 --> 01:28:40.375
Where is my child?

35
01:28:40.541 --> 01:28:43.541
We've escaped them sister. you're safe.

36
01:28:43.708 --> 01:28:44.916
We'll fix your eyes.

37
01:28:45.125 --> 01:28:48.041
But first we need to find Harun.

38
01:28:48.916 --> 01:28:51.333
The Americans are following him.

39
01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:53.750
We need to warn him.

40
01:28:54.208 --> 01:28:55.750
Where's he headed?

41
01:28:56.791 --> 01:28:58.833
He's going downriver with the child.

42
01:28:59.083 --> 01:29:00.708
Headed to Than Ton Temple.

43
01:29:01.791 --> 01:29:03.583
To see the Nirmata.

44
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.541
We will take the child.

45
01:32:28.083 --> 01:32:30.125
Joshua. come.

46
01:32:30.666 --> 01:32:32.458
She is ready for you.

47
01:36:58.833 --> 01:37:01.750
NOMAD has found us!

48
01:37:02.250 --> 01:37:03.791
