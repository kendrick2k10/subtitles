00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:32.153
I can see things others can’t.

8
00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.239
Also I can move anywhere in time.

The future and the past.

10
00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:40.060
My past has many secrets.

11
00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:44.857
I’ve learned that I can’t change the past.
but I can take something from it.

The boy hears the dead woman moving
around down stairs.

The last time I saw my brother was the
night he disappeared.

50
00:05:02.554 --> 00:05:07.201
[Emma]
Quins face was on every news channel in
Shasta.

51
00:05:07.267 --> 00:05:11.038
[Emma]
He was the missing boy who vanished in
thin air.

52
00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:14.250
[Emma]
I don’t remember much about that night.

53
00:05:14.316 --> 00:05:19.046
[Emma]
There were no signs of a break in and all
the doors and windows were locked

54
00:05:19.112 --> 00:05:21.888
[Emma] When the news started
to lose interest about my brother's

55
00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:24.993
disappearance and began following
the other stories of missing people.

56
00:05:25.786 --> 00:05:31.083
[Emma]
I would spend most of my time in my room
away from my mom.

57
00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:34.771
[Emma]
That's when my mom and Drifted apart.

58

[Emma]
Her spirit was broken just like mine.

I miss my brother. I miss hearing his
laugh.

00:06:10.998 --> 00:06:13.434
[Emma]
We did everything together.

63
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.854
[Emma]
I always had his back and he always had
mine.

64
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.234
[Emma]
He’s always on my mind. I dream about
him often.

65
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.054
[Emma]
I enjoy falling asleep so I can escape
reality.

[Kids laughing]

67
00:06:49.953 --> 00:06:52.682

Sometimes I would have bad dreams.

68
00:06:52.748 --> 00:06:55.125

calling to me.

Help me.

74
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:14.402
[Emma] He always sounded
scared and alone. I'm

75
00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:18.641
always alone in the dreams.
I could never find him.

76
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:31.745

And then I would wake up.

mom fell into depression.

00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:45.597
[Emma] My grandma was
special to me. she helped

80
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.821
me open up about everything
that was bothering me.

[Grandma and Emma laughing]

82
00:07:50.764 --> 00:07:55.703

My Grandma has been alone since my
grandpa disappeared around Mount Shasta.

[Grandma]
That's really good. You're a good cook.

84
00:07:59.106 --> 00:08:01.318
[Emma] He went missing
around the same time my

85
00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:03.986
brother disappeared. We
lost two loved ones that year.

[Wind blowing]

87
00:08:09.825 --> 00:08:12.214
[Emma] My Grandma would spend most of her

88
00:08:12.247 --> 00:08:14.847
nights watching my
Grandpa’s research vlogs.

89
00:08:14.913 --> 00:08:18.880
[Emma] My Grandma believed
something inside Mount Shasta took

90
00:08:18.913 --> 00:08:22.913
Grandpa and my brother. She
believes the lemurians took them.

91
00:08:35.183 --> 00:08:38.571
[Jack Widmer] Good
morning. I hope you all can hear

92
00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:41.958
me. I’m using a new camera
and I hope it's working.

93
00:08:42.024 --> 00:08:45.762
Today is Sunday. February 27th.
It's about six in the morning and a

94
00:08:45.795 --> 00:08:50.024
beautiful morning. You can see Mount
Shasta behind me. isn't she gorgeous.

95
00:08:52.367 --> 00:08:55.513
I just want to say hi to my loving wife
Barbara.

96
00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:59.301
She's usually by my side
during these explorations. but

97
00:08:59.334 --> 00:09:03.020
she hasn't been feeling
to well for the last two days.

98
00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:07.900
About two hours from now I'll be
exploring the baseline of Mount Shasta.

99
00:09:07.966 --> 00:09:11.696
And I hope to find the lost city
entrance of Telos.

100
00:09:11.762 --> 00:09:14.878
I need to be careful. The
energy around here can

101
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:17.994
change rather quickly
if I cause a disturbance.

102
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.833
I'll using special equipment to locate
any of the tunnels within the mountain.

103
00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:30.006
The Lemurians were well known for using a
complex vast tunnel system to get around.

104
00:09:30.072 --> 00:09:33.373
I'll be video documenting
my way to Mount Shasta. And I

105
00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:36.679
hope to capture some
interesting sightings in the sky.

106
00:09:36.745 --> 00:09:39.598
They can be very curious when they want
to be.

107
00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:42.918
This is Jack Widmer signing out.

108
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.619
[Emma]
Lemurians

109
00:10:00.685 --> 00:10:04.590
My Grandma told me Lumerians
are a highly evolved spiritual race

110
00:10:04.623 --> 00:10:08.685
who live in an underground city
11 miles deep within Mount Shasta.

111
00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:16.010
Some people have claimed the city is full
of gold and shields and powerful crystals.

112
00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:21.307
The city is called Telos. This city
houses 200.000 lemurians.

113
00:10:21.373 --> 00:10:24.727
Today many people flock to Mt. Shasta.

114
00:10:24.793 --> 00:10:28.123
Some people have reported
hearing low frequency

115
00:10:28.156 --> 00:10:31.233
sound coming from the
peak of the mountain.

116
00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:35.237
while others have witnessed bright lights
moving around the mountain.

117
00:10:35.303 --> 00:10:39.533
It’s these types of mysteries that have
made my grandparents search for the truth.

118
00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:43.031
While Grandpa was focused
on the search for lemurians

119
00:10:43.064 --> 00:10:46.398
my Grandma was more
interested in other phenomenon.

120
00:10:46.773 --> 00:10:49.565
By the way my Grandma. like my Grandpa is

121
00:10:49.598 --> 00:10:52.630
different and always
thinks outside the box.

122
00:10:52.696 --> 00:10:57.802
She believes in anything from Bigfoot to
UFOs crop circles and time travel.

123
00:10:57.868 --> 00:11:01.496
You name it. my Grandma has researched
it all.

124
00:11:04.207 --> 00:11:06.710
[Emma]
Video feedback loop.

125
00:11:07.627 --> 00:11:10.912
This involves a video
camera connected to a TV

126
00:11:10.945 --> 00:11:14.551
monitor that creates
looping pattern interference.

127
00:11:19.598 --> 00:11:23.396
Paranormal investigators use this
technique because they believe the

128
00:11:23.429 --> 00:11:27.598
video feedback helps energy from
other dimensions connect with the living.

129
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:35.155
My Grandma has been working on this
concept ever since my grandpa
disappeared.

130
00:11:35.906 --> 00:11:43.580
[TV static]

131
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.262
[Emma] Every night she
tries to make contact with him.

Waiting for any sign to come
through. an image or his voice.

133
00:11:54.299 --> 00:11:58.845
[Grandma]
I know you can do. just say my name.

134
00:11:59.596 --> 00:12:03.183
Say my name.

136
00:12:05.268 --> 00:12:07.371
Please say my name.

137

Jack. say my name.

139
00:12:13.235 --> 00:12:16.338
I know you can do it Jack.

140
00:12:16.404 --> 00:12:22.118
Can you hear me? If you can
hear my. say my name.

141
00:12:22.827 --> 00:12:25.914
[Sigh]

142
00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:32.479
Say my name. just say my name.

143
00:12:32.545 --> 00:12:40.053

say my name.

[Grandpa]
Barbara!

147
00:13:31.646 --> 00:13:35.395
When I was 9 years old my
Grandma used the The video

148
00:13:35.428 --> 00:13:39.646
feedback on me to help me
to astral travel to the unknown.

149
00:13:39.904 --> 00:13:44.802
[Grandma]
Let's begin.

150
00:13:44.868 --> 00:13:48.180
You're safe now.

151
00:13:48.246 --> 00:13:53.560
I want you to focus only on my voice.

152
00:13:53.626 --> 00:13:56.647
You are a traveler

153
00:13:56.713 --> 00:13:59.257
You are now free from this world

154
00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:05.823
Free from everything.

155
00:14:05.889 --> 00:14:09.159
You see a door.

156
00:14:09.225 --> 00:14:16.375
This door will open secrets
only you will see.

157
00:14:16.441 --> 00:14:20.379
You are not afraid.

158
00:14:20.445 --> 00:14:28.095
You see yourself moving closer and closer.

159
00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:33.666
When I count to three. the door will open.

160
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.978
One.

161
00:14:36.044 --> 00:14:38.772
Two.

162
00:14:38.838 --> 00:14:41.091
Three.

163
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.761
What do you see?

164
00:14:48.139 --> 00:14:50.225
[Loud static boom]

[Emma playing sounds]

167
00:14:58.775 --> 00:15:01.820
That was the first time I met Cyan.

168
00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:07.617
After my first astral trip this spirit
became a part of my life.

169
00:15:08.076 --> 00:15:15.125
[Emma playing sound]

170
00:15:15.834 --> 00:15:21.172
My Grandma believes this female
presence is my spirit guide or
guardian angel.

171
00:15:22.173 --> 00:15:26.302
[Cyan]
May I play?

172
00:15:40.692 --> 00:15:42.193
[Emma]
Cyan?

173
00:15:42.944 --> 00:15:46.948
I decided to call this spirit Cyan

349
00:39:42.491 --> 00:39:45.927
been vacationing near mount
Shasta for the last 10 years.

350
00:39:46.136 --> 00:39:49.865
1983 would be their last vacation
together.

351
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:53.234
Manuel Rose's son 13
year old James Rose went

352
00:39:53.267 --> 00:39:56.455
missing on the third
day of their vacation.

353
00:39:56.521 --> 00:40:00.114
While hiking near the base of Mount Shasta

354
00:40:00.147 --> 00:40:03.945
Manuel and James lost
touch with each other.

355
00:40:04.112 --> 00:40:08.408
It was the last time anyone saw
young James again.

356
00:40:09.367 --> 00:40:13.622
Police and rangers scoured the
forest looking for James.

357
00:40:15.999 --> 00:40:19.061
Manuel Rose describes to a television
crew in 1994

358
00:40:19.127 --> 00:40:23.298
about a young woman who approached
deep in the woods while looking for
his son.

359
00:40:23.632 --> 00:40:27.177
The woman was described as out
of place. looking angelic.

360
00:40:27.385 --> 00:40:31.156
A local sketch artist created an
image of the mysterious woman.

361
00:40:31.222 --> 00:40:36.912
Some people believe Manuel
crossed paths with a lemunian being.

362
00:40:36.978 --> 00:40:40.347
One from nearby
towns reported recognizing

363
00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.318
this person to be from the local area.

364
00:40:43.443 --> 00:40:46.696
What do you believe?

365
00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:09.052
[Electric shock]

366
00:41:43.878 --> 00:41:45.981
[Grandma]
Oh God. where did you get this?

367
00:41:46.047 --> 00:41:47.841
[Emma]
I don't know.

368
00:41:48.633 --> 00:41:50.135
[Grandma]
This is important.

369
00:41:55.473 --> 00:41:56.474
[Grandma]
Come here.

370
00:41:59.978 --> 00:42:03.248
[Emma]
My Grandma knew I had a powerful
gift when she saw the watch.

371
00:42:03.314 --> 00:42:06.961
My Grandpa wore that watch on the
day he disappeared.

372
00:42:07.027 --> 00:42:10.375
I told my Grandma everything
about my dreams and all the things

373
00:42:10.408 --> 00:42:13.467
I was able to pull through
during my astral travel trips.

374
00:42:13.533 --> 00:42:16.941
I was able to grab onto
something from the past.

375
00:42:16.974 --> 00:42:20.057
A toy tire. a coin.
but this was different.

376
00:42:20.123 --> 00:42:24.034
I told grandma everything
She told me I have a gift. not

377
00:42:24.067 --> 00:42:27.940
a gift to astral travel but
astral travel back in time.

378
00:42:28.006 --> 00:42:32.427
I can't change the past. but i have the
ability to bring something back.

379
00:42:34.137 --> 00:42:36.723
Grandma knew a psychic from the area.
.

380
00:42:39.017 --> 00:42:44.623
[Grandma]
Hi. hey. I need to bring my
granddaughter in to get a reading.

381
00:42:44.689 --> 00:42:48.182
[Emma] Grandma knew a psychic
from the area who might be able to

382
00:42:48.215 --> 00:42:51.797
help me understand more about
my gifts so she took me to see her.

383
00:42:51.863 --> 00:42:54.758
I was nervous but willing to try anything.

384
00:42:54.824 --> 00:42:58.953
[Grandma]
I appreciate it so much. Thank you.
thank you.

385
00:43:05.251 --> 00:43:07.187
[Clock ticking]

386
00:43:07.253 --> 00:43:09.798
[Psychic]
Okay. let's begin.

387
00:43:10.715 --> 00:43:14.817
I want you to close your
eyes. take a few deep

388
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:18.715
breaths and focus on
the sound of my voice.

389
00:43:25.438 --> 00:43:29.192
Push your thoughts out of your mind.

390
00:43:30.235 --> 00:43:33.935
As you feel them drift further and further

391
00:43:33.968 --> 00:43:38.235
away. you find yourself
floating in nothingness.

392
00:43:41.454 --> 00:43:49.454
While you’re in this space. allow your
mind to focus on what you most
desire to know.

393
00:43:57.053 --> 00:44:00.014
What are you searching for Emma?

394
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:05.019
What are you yearning to uncover?

395
00:44:05.603 --> 00:44:13.603
Keep focusing on that feeling
and allow it to grow stronger.

396
00:45:17.884 --> 00:45:23.031
You may open your eyes now.

397
00:45:23.097 --> 00:45:29.580
Traditionally. the Star Card represents
inspiration.

398
00:45:29.646 --> 00:45:37.646
renewed hope and a possibility for
rebirth after great struggle. change
and chaos.

399
00:45:38.655 --> 00:45:43.886
For you. I sense that there is a
second meaning.

400
00:45:43.952 --> 00:45:51.952
There is a messenger. a presenter of
sorts. she is searching for you.

401
00:45:53.169 --> 00:45:56.749
She brings something wrapped in light that

402
00:45:56.782 --> 00:46:01.169
unfortunately reveals
within it undesirable truths.

403
00:46:08.101 --> 00:46:16.001
She is a beautiful spirit who is
surrounded in darkness.

404
00:46:16.067 --> 00:46:19.004
She walks through the shadows

405
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:23.675
She is cosmic and wise.

406
00:46:23.741 --> 00:46:27.447
She has been making
her way to you for many

407
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.741
years now and comes to
you with outstretched arms

408
00:46:36.212 --> 00:46:43.028
She beckons you forward towards
your destiny.

409
00:46:43.094 --> 00:46:47.061
While she doesn’t mean
to cause you any harm. the

410
00:46:47.094 --> 00:46:51.094
truths she reveals bring
great emotional turmoil.

411
00:46:54.147 --> 00:46:59.962
I want you to know that you have
the ability to move through this.

412
00:47:00.028 --> 00:47:05.968
The pain and hardships that will
arise from this difficult encounter

413
00:47:06.034 --> 00:47:14.034
act like a beacon of light
illuminating the path that
stretches out before you.

414
00:47:14.667 --> 00:47:22.667
Even though the truth may hurt.
whatever she reveals to you
has great purpose.

415
00:47:22.925 --> 00:47:30.200
I want you to remember that you
have what it takes to navigate through
this.

416
00:47:30.266 --> 00:47:33.870
You have all you need to triumph.

417
00:47:33.936 --> 00:47:35.956
[Emma]
Her friend pulled a card for me.

418
00:47:36.022 --> 00:47:39.918
The card revealed that I indeed had
a spirit guide that was trying to
help me

419
00:47:39.984 --> 00:47:43.463
and it was up to me to understand
what she was trying to show me.

420
00:47:43.529 --> 00:47:46.466
My Grandma felt that. when I was
astral traveling.

421
00:47:46.532 --> 00:47:51.013
that I was going through the portal that
all the missing people disappeared through.

422
00:47:51.079 --> 00:47:54.496
because I was able to
bring back an object that

423
00:47:54.529 --> 00:47:57.686
was with my Grandpa
the day he disappeared.

424
00:47:57.752 --> 00:48:00.499
that maybe I would be able
to retrieve items from my

425
00:48:00.532 --> 00:48:03.525
brother and the other three
people who had gone missing.

426
00:48:03.591 --> 00:48:06.570
and prove to the world that anything
is possible.

427
00:48:06.636 --> 00:48:09.573
This was something she could show
to the skeptics.

428
00:48:09.639 --> 00:48:12.659
I had to prepare myself for the ultimate
trip.

429
00:48:12.725 --> 00:48:16.204
I had to prepare myself for what’s
behind the wall of time.

430
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:22.235
My brother was waiting for me.
I was ready.

431
00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:26.757
[TV switch click]

432
00:48:26.823 --> 00:48:31.369
[Camera beeps]

433
00:48:33.788 --> 00:48:39.210
The first person I was going to visit
was Sage Martin.

434
00:48:48.469 --> 00:48:51.472
[Grandma]
You're safe now.

435
00:48:51.806 --> 00:48:56.745
I want you to focus only on my voice.

436
00:48:56.811 --> 00:49:00.624
You are a traveler.

437
00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:05.796
You're now free from this world.

438
00:49:05.862 --> 00:49:11.534
Free from everything.

439
00:49:13.327 --> 00:49:16.098
[Piano tone]

440
00:49:16.164 --> 00:49:18.225
[Sage Martin laughing]

441
00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:20.477
[Sage]
Do it again.

442
00:49:20.543 --> 00:49:23.271
[Piano tone]

443
00:49:23.337 --> 00:49:26.924
[Sage]
Again.

444
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:32.054
[Electric static]

445
00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:57.497
[Emma]
Now it was Logan Douglas turn.

446
00:49:58.456 --> 00:50:02.126
[Crickets]

447
00:50:05.421 --> 00:50:11.177
[Logan Douglas breathing heavily]

448
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:15.323
[Logan]
Somebody help me!

449
00:50:15.389 --> 00:50:20.019
[Rumbling]

450
00:50:20.561 --> 00:50:22.813
[Logan]
God help!

451
00:50:38.621 --> 00:50:43.334
[Emma]
Now I was off to visit Alex Hayden.

452
00:50:43.793 --> 00:50:49.524
[Muffled car horn]

453
00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:56.698
[Water splashing]

454
00:50:56.764 --> 00:51:00.309
[Muffled car horn]

455
00:51:19.495 --> 00:51:22.193
[Emma] Every trip I was able to bring back

456
00:51:22.226 --> 00:51:25.477
something. and now I was
ready to go even further.

457
00:51:25.543 --> 00:51:28.546
It was time to get my brother.

458
00:51:38.472 --> 00:51:42.744
[Grandma]
You're safe now.

459
00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:46.957
I want you to focus only on my voice.

460
00:51:47.023 --> 00:51:50.043
You are a traveler.

461
00:51:50.109 --> 00:51:53.713
You're now free from this world.

462
00:51:53.779 --> 00:51:58.009
Free from everything.

463
00:51:58.075 --> 00:52:04.182
It's now June 4th. 2017

464
00:52:04.248 --> 00:52:08.770
The time is 10:20 pm.

465
00:52:08.836 --> 00:52:12.607
You're ten years old.

466
00:52:12.673 --> 00:52:16.027
You're at that moment.

467
00:52:16.093 --> 00:52:19.531
Safe at home.

468
00:52:19.597 --> 00:52:22.993
You hear your brother's voice.

469
00:52:23.059 --> 00:52:26.687
What do you see?

470
00:52:27.605 --> 00:52:29.874
[Quinn]
Where are you?

471
00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:36.590
[Emma laughing]

472
00:52:36.656 --> 00:52:39.259
[Emma]
I scared you.

473
00:52:39.325 --> 00:52:42.220
[Quinn]
No. go to sleep Emma.

474
00:52:42.286 --> 00:52:44.598
[Emma]
Hey. I didn't finish the story.

475
00:52:44.664 --> 00:52:48.685
[Quinn]
Mom is going to get mad.

476
00:52:48.751 --> 00:52:52.188
[Quinn]
Go to bed Emma.

477
00:52:52.254 --> 00:52:59.095
[Mom]
You two go to bed. You guys
have school tomorrow.

478
00:53:03.182 --> 00:53:05.535
[Quinn]
Did you hear me?

479
00:53:05.601 --> 00:53:09.664
[Emma]
The door slowly opens.

480
00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:12.834
[Door click]

481
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:20.491
[Door creaks]

482
00:53:30.126 --> 00:53:33.563
[Emma]
Quinn!

483
00:53:33.629 --> 00:53:39.027
[Rumbling]

484
00:53:39.093 --> 00:53:43.264
[Electric static]

485
00:53:50.312 --> 00:53:53.708
[Emma]
He's here!

486
00:53:53.774 --> 00:53:56.252
[Grandma]
Who's here?

487
00:53:56.318 --> 00:53:58.880
[Emma]
Quinn!

488
00:53:58.946 --> 00:54:01.866
[Emma]
Quinn where are you?

489
00:54:04.994 --> 00:54:07.222
[Emma]
Quinn come out.

490
00:54:07.288 --> 00:54:09.265
[Grandma]
Emma. he didn't come through.

491
00:54:09.331 --> 00:54:10.392
[Emma]
Yeah he did. I saw him

492
00:54:10.458 --> 00:54:11.393
[Grandma]
He's not here.

493
00:54:11.459 --> 00:54:12.435
[Emma]
He is here.

494
00:54:12.501 --> 00:54:14.378
[Door knocking]

495
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.130
[Emma]
He's here!

496
00:54:21.469 --> 00:54:22.779
[Emma]
Quinn!

497
00:54:22.845 --> 00:54:23.845
[Grandma]
Oh my God!

498
00:54:25.347 --> 00:54:27.558
[Grandma]
You're safe. you're safe Quinn.

499
00:54:28.392 --> 00:54:30.829
[Grandma]
Don't move!

500
00:54:30.895 --> 00:54:33.164
[Grandma]
Wait Emma. don't touch him.

501
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:35.441
[Emma]
It's okay Quinn.

502
00:54:36.317 --> 00:54:38.980
[Emma] I knew I was
able to bring my brother

503
00:54:39.013 --> 00:54:41.464
back even though it was hard to believe.

504
00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:45.135
I was seeing him with my own eyes.
He was here.

505
00:54:45.201 --> 00:54:49.723
Grandma was shocked and cautious.
she wouldn’t let me go near him.

506
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:53.560
She believed Quinn was surrounded
with lemurian energy.

507
00:54:53.626 --> 00:54:56.646
I just stood there. I had no emotions.

508
00:54:56.712 --> 00:55:00.400
There was something not right. Quinn
was different.

509
00:55:00.466 --> 00:55:06.156
He looked older. Something or someone
took the life out of his eyes.

510
00:55:06.222 --> 00:55:09.308
Something just wasn't right.

511
00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:19.060
[Crickets]

512
00:55:24.698 --> 00:55:28.128
[Emma] On the last night I
saw Cyan. she told me the

513
00:55:28.161 --> 00:55:31.890
reason she could see her
was because I was very special.

514
00:55:31.956 --> 00:55:33.927
She said they are preparing people like me

515
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.060
to be ready to help
them when the time came.

516
00:55:36.126 --> 00:55:38.646
To help our planet and the human race
heal.

517
00:55:38.712 --> 00:55:42.437
She told me they’re
more like her. and they too

518
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:46.387
