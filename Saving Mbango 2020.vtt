00:13:41.968 --> 00:13:42.991
Oggen

193
00:13:45.004 --> 00:13:46.255
Iya

194
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.000
(Snoring)

195
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.280
Iya open this door.

196
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.520
Ok

197
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.400
You people lock my door

198
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:03.880
(Snoring away)

199
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.900
Useless children.

200
00:14:27.723 --> 00:14:29.778
You locked me out of my house?

201
00:14:33.075 --> 00:14:34.966
You left me to sleep outside?

202
00:14:37.163 --> 00:14:39.139
And you stupid woman.

203
00:14:40.257 --> 00:14:42.491
you laid on my bed snoring.

204
00:14:47.028 --> 00:14:48.825
I will teach you guys a lesson.

205
00:14:49.106 --> 00:14:50.380
Stop looking at me.

206
00:14:50.895 --> 00:14:52.935
Look like a ripe pawpaw.

207
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.700
Your mates go to Equatorial Guinea
and bring back better goodies.

208
00:14:55.732 --> 00:14:57.106
you go and come back with
skin lightening cream

209
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.860
to spoil the environment with.

210
00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.900
Bunch of bushmeat!

211
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.420
Bunch of whores.

212
00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:02.568
Get out of my face!

213
00:15:04.473 --> 00:15:05.778
Father

214
00:15:06.888 --> 00:15:08.654
that is my wife you are berating.

215
00:15:08.693 --> 00:15:10.154
Shut your filthy mouth!

216
00:15:10.412 --> 00:15:11.506
You drunk!

217
00:15:12.272 --> 00:15:13.943
Can you dowry a woman?

218
00:15:14.459 --> 00:15:16.255
You dare measure words with me

219
00:15:16.286 --> 00:15:19.144
You are incapable of getting
money to marry your woman.

220
00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:21.021
and you want to measure up to me.

221
00:15:21.053 --> 00:15:22.060
nonsense!

222
00:15:23.201 --> 00:15:24.232
John.

223
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.420
this is all because of you that father insults me.

224
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.960
Are you happy with that?

225
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.940
I ask you for a small sum of
money to go marry my woman.

226
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.700
you are refusing to help me.

227
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.420
Why are you so wicked?

228
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.300
No think about it. Is it fair?

229
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.880
Good morning to you to you too senior brother

230
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.480
How did you sleep?

231
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.180
(mockery)

232
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.360
( giggles and Laughter)

233
00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.880
Look at you

234
00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:56.020
I will teach you all a lesson.

235
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:08.020
(selecting palm fruits)

236
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.520
Mbango

237
00:16:22.679 --> 00:16:23.906
Yes grandma

238
00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:37.570
I am starving.

239
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.380
Mbango. am asking for food instead you give me palmnuts?

240
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.520
(grandma throws away the nuts in frustration)

241
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.740
ah ah! Aam Aam?

242
00:17:05.263 --> 00:17:07.662
The swelling has increased.

243
00:17:08.951 --> 00:17:10.490
This is serious.

244
00:17:10.576 --> 00:17:11.482
Take heart.

245
00:17:11.537 --> 00:17:12.592
Thank You

246
00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:16.725
Dam Dam

247
00:17:16.857 --> 00:17:18.936
don’t worry we will do
the dowry rites here.

248
00:17:18.983 --> 00:17:20.795
In my father’s house.

249
00:17:21.267 --> 00:17:23.422
Where has it been seen
that a dowry for a girl

250
00:17:23.447 --> 00:17:25.501
is paid at the man’s parents?

251
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.883
It is at my parents’ house
that it should take place.

252
00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:30.571
I already informed them you will be coming

253
00:17:30.814 --> 00:17:32.454
Oh no. Why did you do that?

254
00:17:35.173 --> 00:17:37.212
Now they will be expecting me.

255
00:17:37.329 --> 00:17:40.255
Did you not say we
are getting married soon?

256
00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:41.365
Yes…

257
00:17:43.338 --> 00:17:45.909
I don’t even have the money.

258
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.250
Been begging my brother to give me money…

259
00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.723
I told John to give me
money and he refused.

260
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.222
I have no choice than to
wait for my father to come

261
00:18:03.247 --> 00:18:04.263
and talk to him more.

262
00:18:04.303 --> 00:18:07.373
He might give me the
money to go see your folk.

263
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.420
Then why did you give the
impression we are getting married soon?

264
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.680
(sighs)

265
00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.820
Amm Amm

266
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.940
(drums)

267
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.900
Damn. why startle me?

268
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.760
Do you ever speak?

269
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.366
Mbango. who is talking?

270
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.560
(The gong)

271
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:21.460
(music)

272
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.940
(music fades)

273
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.120
What is this you are reading?

274
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.700
What have I told you about
speaking pidgin English?

275
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.820
What are you reading?

276
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.893
I am just revisiting
my old geography notes.

277
00:20:14.693 --> 00:20:18.193
Are you sure you will make it
to the university this time.

278
00:20:18.264 --> 00:20:20.076
Yes. I am ready.

279
00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:26.521
Ok. Don’t worry Oggen will take care of us.

280
00:20:31.429 --> 00:20:32.499
Don’t worry.

281
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.500
I will visit you home from time to time.. ok?

282
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:44.580
This one is above your knowledge. Its bigger than your level.

283
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.340
Why did you bring me the food?

284
00:21:12.932 --> 00:21:14.885
What is this attitude?

285
00:21:16.377 --> 00:21:17.971
What attitude?

286
00:21:18.807 --> 00:21:20.823
To startle people always.

287
00:21:21.899 --> 00:21:23.836
Wait a minute...So. you can speak?

288
00:21:24.649 --> 00:21:26.498
Just want to know why you gave the food.

289
00:21:26.523 --> 00:21:28.250
I didn’t as you for anything.

290
00:21:32.893 --> 00:21:36.049
Because I know what hunger does to people.

291
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.542
Everyone has their own problem.

292
00:21:47.373 --> 00:21:48.756
Wait.

293
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.000
Give me your bag.

294
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.700
(smiles)

295
00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.820
(contented)

296
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.360
(music)

297
00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.720
Namundo

298
00:22:57.947 --> 00:22:59.119
Goodbye

299
00:23:00.603 --> 00:23:01.705

301
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.660
Take this.

302
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.520
(Everyone rushes to receive a share)

303
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.600
Amm Amm

304
00:23:24.435 --> 00:23:25.052

Yes.

306
00:23:25.724 --> 00:23:26.844
Come and get your own money.

307
00:23:27.622 --> 00:23:29.645
Don’t come complaining afterwards.

308
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:33.974
Father. no.

309
00:23:34.013 --> 00:23:35.921
That is not fair.

310
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.600
Give our own money.

311
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.680
(counting savings)

312
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:11.860
(music)

313
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.520
This is to inform you all that

314
00:24:45.552 --> 00:24:47.693
finally I will be going to the university.

315
00:24:48.667 --> 00:24:50.658
I have been able to gather the money.

316
00:24:51.292 --> 00:24:54.096
So I wish that you guys

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:57.042

319
00:24:58.229 --> 00:25:00.198
so that the household can be provided for.

320
00:25:04.896 --> 00:25:06.669
I can’t work on the palm plantation.

321
00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:09.107
Look at me.

322
00:25:10.252 --> 00:25:12.599
I will give birth soon.

323
00:25:13.998 --> 00:25:15.857
You are going to the university

324
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.680
Who is going to take care of me and my kid?

325
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.300
Who is going to take care of your kid?

326
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.660

Beatrice

330
00:25:33.794 --> 00:25:35.208
What is it?

331
00:25:35.398 --> 00:25:37.499
Listen to what your brother is saying.

332
00:25:38.733 --> 00:25:40.819
He says he will go to the university

333
00:25:41.186 --> 00:25:44.741
and leave the palm plantation to you

334
00:25:45.123 --> 00:25:46.311

I can’t work on the farm.

00:26:00.308 --> 00:26:02.183
I am due soon.

342
00:26:03.136 --> 00:26:05.190
Whether you accept it or not.

00:26:05.268 --> 00:26:06.550
I am going to the university.

344
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.440

00:27:02.962 --> 00:27:03.554
Yes

347
00:27:03.579 --> 00:27:04.946
Who took money from my room?

348
00:27:04.993 --> 00:27:06.001
I don’t know!

349
00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.061
Where is everybody

350
00:27:07.086 --> 00:27:08.384
They are at Amdam’s parents.

351
00:27:08.431 --> 00:27:09.461
What are they doing there?

352
00:27:09.485 --> 00:27:10.993
Oggen is paying Amdam’s dowry.

353
00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.516
You start with the husband.

354
00:27:18.229 --> 00:27:19.229
Thank you

355
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:20.182

356
00:27:20.229 --> 00:27:21.682
I haven’t picked mine.

357
00:27:22.404 --> 00:27:24.435
Hello my in-laws

358
00:27:24.927 --> 00:27:27.779
This cola is like the one we

We thank you

00:27:34.132 --> 00:27:36.890
We are sorry we are coming late.

362
00:27:37.065 --> 00:27:39.845
Only after my son has birthed
3 issues with your daughter.

363
00:27:39.884 --> 00:27:41.634
But we have vowed that today.

364
00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.814
we are taking her back in the proper way.
We come prepared.

365
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.200
Everyone who accompanied me here is ready.

366
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:52.740
So that we go back and start

Give it back

371
00:28:01.335 --> 00:28:02.452
Seize it.

372
00:28:02.507 --> 00:28:03.836
I say seize it.

373
00:28:04.227 --> 00:28:05.406
Stand there.

374
00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:06.740
Are you insane?

375
00:28:07.256 --> 00:28:09.053
Look at your tiny eyes.

376
00:28:09.435 --> 00:28:10.787
Who do you want to disgrace?

377
00:28:10.937 --> 00:28:12.880
I am a respected man in this village

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.240

379
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.300
Animal!

380
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.880
(Packing belongings)

381
00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.140
John

382
00:28:43.449 --> 00:28:44.449
John

383
00:28:44.566 --> 00:28:45.566
John!

384
00:28:46.879 --> 00:28:48.425
Please don’t go

385
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.496
I have to go.
I am tired of living like this.

386
00:28:50.527 --> 00:28:51.566
Where are you going to go to?

387
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:52.363
I don’t know!

388
00:28:52.402 --> 00:28:53.707
What I do now?

389
00:28:53.927 --> 00:28:55.295
I will come see you.

390
00:30:05.482 --> 00:30:07.131
Get out of my chair.

391
00:30:12.678 --> 00:30:13.920
Maggie.

392
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.250
bring me water to drink.

393
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.030
Hold on. I am coming back.

394
00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.870
Why should we wait for you?

395
00:30:22.914 --> 00:30:25.335
Eat gradually no fighting

396
00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:26.780
You dont eat garri?

397
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.280
hell no!

398
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.800
don't collide with my spoon again...ok?

399
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:29.570
What is it?

400
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:33.460
So you are swallowing food with your fat mouths

401
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.880
without worrying about my
only son’s whereabouts.

402
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.180
Aha father.

403
00:30:38.585 --> 00:30:39.906
your only son?

404
00:30:40.215 --> 00:30:41.731
I am your son too.

405
00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.996
What type of son?

406
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.965
What type of a son are you?

407
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.865
Father. you called this
meeting to insult us.

408
00:30:50.816 --> 00:30:54.066
I don’t want to see anyone
of you in this compound

409
00:30:54.809 --> 00:30:57.566
if you don’t return with my only son.

410
00:30:57.643 --> 00:30:58.368
But father.

411
00:30:58.407 --> 00:31:00.345
we did not cause him to leave the house.

412
00:31:01.963 --> 00:31:03.619
Oggen. this is all your fault.

413
00:31:04.197 --> 00:31:05.338
What did I do?

414
00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:07.962
Tell me what I did.

415
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.380
You took his money.

416
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.080
Hei hei hush shush.

417
00:31:13.126 --> 00:31:14.259
Let it go.

418
00:31:14.712 --> 00:31:15.892
Is it his money?

419
00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:16.652
Take it easy.

420
00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:18.090
It is the family’s money.

421
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.160
Sit down.

422
00:31:19.981 --> 00:31:21.770
Is he not a child of this family?

423
00:31:22.849 --> 00:31:24.232
(spoofs) I took his money!

424
00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.060
Is that not so father?

425
00:31:29.576 --> 00:31:33.490
(Laughter)

426
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.120
(Music)

427
00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.180
Sango of all Sangos (saluting)

428
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.520
You steal.
yet you have a sympathetic heart.

429
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.938
You know nothing about me.

430
00:32:33.266 --> 00:32:34.938
Where did you steal this one?

431
00:32:35.016 --> 00:32:36.516
I am not a thief.

432
00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.762
That was a joke.

433
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.180
I know you are not a thief.

434
00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.520
No farm or market today?

435
00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.320
Let me help you with your load.

436
00:32:51.358 --> 00:32:52.740
then I will tell you.

437
00:32:52.888 --> 00:32:54.427
Come on. Give me.

438
00:32:58.843 --> 00:33:00.562
How are you?

439
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.640
I am ok.

440
00:33:01.742 --> 00:33:03.031
Where did you get these?

441
00:33:03.262 --> 00:33:05.262
I picked them from somewhere down there.

442
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:06.212
From whose farm?

443
00:33:06.243 --> 00:33:07.595
Not from your plantation.

444
00:33:08.595 --> 00:33:10.376
Did I say it was from our farm?

445
00:33:11.737 --> 00:33:13.198
Can eat one?

446
00:33:13.276 --> 00:33:14.323
Yes. You can.

447
00:33:19.966 --> 00:33:22.036
Here. taste it.

448
00:33:45.954 --> 00:33:47.025
Your Are

449
00:33:48.118 --> 00:33:49.790
You go first!

450
00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.247
Your house looks good.

451
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:59.005
Thank you.

452
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.622
Who gave it to you?

453
00:34:01.856 --> 00:34:03.091
I am renting.

454
00:34:03.762 --> 00:34:05.028
Who has it?

455
00:34:05.434 --> 00:34:08.192
The brother of the person
who used to be here

456
00:34:08.284 --> 00:34:12.049
Have you heard that the lady
who used to live here at first.

457
00:34:12.182 --> 00:34:13.385
was a witch?

458
00:34:13.412 --> 00:34:14.818
She used to eat children.

459
00:34:14.857 --> 00:34:16.694
She sat exactly at that spot
where you are sitting at the

460
00:34:16.718 --> 00:34:18.896
moment of her dead.

461
00:34:28.234 --> 00:34:31.289
Have you heard people say you are a witch?

462
00:34:31.477 --> 00:34:33.500
That you killed your parents.

463
00:34:36.576 --> 00:34:38.381
But I don’t believe them.

464
00:34:39.623 --> 00:34:41.162
What do they know?

465
00:34:47.091 --> 00:34:48.192
John.

466
00:34:48.356 --> 00:34:49.934
My name is John!

467
00:34:50.565 --> 00:34:51.979
John.

468
00:34:52.307 --> 00:34:53.604
Yes

469
00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.900
(sounds of natural habitat)

470
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.560
(drinking beer)

471
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.100
What type of father are you?

472
00:35:34.234 --> 00:35:36.890
I wish I could just get a peek at John.

473
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.281
Father do you know you
have to take care of us?

474
00:35:41.148 --> 00:35:42.945
You have to provide for us!

475
00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:46.906
I don’t want my kids to starve to death.

476
00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.140
(covering a pot)

477
00:36:20.343 --> 00:36:22.522
Maybe you should just go back home

478
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:24.210
Hum

479
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:27.074
Just go back home.

480
00:36:27.106 --> 00:36:28.512
It is clear you miss them.

481
00:36:30.145 --> 00:36:32.059
You cannot understand.

482
00:36:37.433 --> 00:36:39.855
I will understand. Tell me.

483
00:36:41.136 --> 00:36:44.410
My father and my brother are lazy.

484
00:36:44.738 --> 00:36:46.707
They only drink. get drunk.

485
00:36:49.394 --> 00:36:51.394
They refuse to do anything.

486
00:36:52.548 --> 00:36:55.040
It is I who takes care of the family.

487
00:36:57.954 --> 00:36:59.619
I produced palm oil

488
00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.149
and sold to raise money for my schooling.

489
00:37:02.809 --> 00:37:06.184
and they stole it to go
marry my brother a wife.

490
00:37:14.373 --> 00:37:16.155
I can’t live a life like this.

491
00:37:16.287 --> 00:37:17.756
I want to go back to school.

492
00:37:20.036 --> 00:37:21.364
I can’t

493
00:37:37.752 --> 00:37:39.276
Spit it out.

494
00:37:39.276 --> 00:37:40.076
(vomiting)

495
00:37:41.504 --> 00:37:43.136
Easy now.

496
00:37:44.652 --> 00:37:46.176
Take heart

497
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:55.640
sorry

498
00:37:59.336 --> 00:38:00.843
Take heart

499
00:38:17.022 --> 00:38:18.772
Have you told him?

500
00:38:20.576 --> 00:38:24.193
Mbango. why haven’t you told him?

501
00:38:26.943 --> 00:38:29.490
Don’t you think he should now?

502
00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:36.735
Come.

503
00:38:38.204 --> 00:38:39.876
lay your head here.

504
00:38:43.374 --> 00:38:45.124
You will be find.

505
00:38:45.702 --> 00:38:47.476
You will be find.

506
00:39:15.684 --> 00:39:17.161
You are so beautiful!

507
00:39:19.577 --> 00:39:22.038
(Chuckles)

508
00:39:38.595 --> 00:39:41.002
Is that blood?

509
00:39:50.834 --> 00:39:52.615
It is blood.

510
00:40:24.532 --> 00:40:26.008
You shouldn’t have taken his money.

511
00:40:26.039 --> 00:40:27.188
Mother. wait…

512
00:40:27.226 --> 00:40:28.273
Mother loo… I don’t…

513
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.696
No. It was family.

514
00:40:29.726 --> 00:40:30.851
Mother. don’t say that.

515
00:40:30.883 --> 00:40:32.485
That money was family money.

516
00:40:32.516 --> 00:40:33.782
It was his money.

517
00:40:33.891 --> 00:40:35.133
It was family.

518
00:40:36.151 --> 00:40:37.720
It was John’s money.

519
00:40:37.807 --> 00:40:39.127
Hei shut your mouth.

520
00:40:39.299 --> 00:40:40.940
It was not family money

521
00:40:41.026 --> 00:40:42.604
I say it was family

522
00:40:42.732 --> 00:40:43.888
Lazy man!

523
00:40:43.943 --> 00:40:46.170
Only making children
you cannot take care of.

524
00:40:49.497 --> 00:40:51.794
Any day. anytime.

525
00:40:51.833 --> 00:40:53.318
I will take the money.

526
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.460
its the family's money

527
00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.320
Stop the noise!

528
00:40:57.717 --> 00:40:59.349
I will hit somebody.

529
00:41:00.052 --> 00:41:01.801
Shut your mouth.

530
00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.373
Nonsense.

531
00:41:04.248 --> 00:41:06.029
I said shut your mouths

532
00:41:26.471 --> 00:41:27.479
Hei.

533
00:41:28.284 --> 00:41:30.010
what are you doing here.

534
00:41:31.385 --> 00:41:33.299
Did your grandma not say you should rest?

535
00:41:35.244 --> 00:41:38.057
Or you are feeling better now

536
00:41:39.791 --> 00:41:41.028
John.

537
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.980
I have something to tell you.

538
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.860
Intruding knock)

539
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.920
She is that...

540
00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.680
why are you here?

541
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.820
(music)

542
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.300
(John sneaks in)

543
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.840
(giggles sweetly)

544
00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.320
I don't like that kind of play

545
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.640
(john tickles on)

546
00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.060
(she laughs on)

547
00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.560
What did you want to tell me?

548
00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.280
hmmm?

549
00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.660
At my home. There is something you wanted to tell me.

550
00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.260
No.it wasn't anything.

551
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.160
Are you sure?

552
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.680
Yes. I am sure.

553
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.940
They are wasting their time.

554
00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.480
The Penda’s did this.

555
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.400
they did that!

556
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.680
They did this!

557
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.020
Wretch of a man!

558
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.480
Coward!

559
00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.460
You want me to die with
your child in my womb?

560
00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.080
If you don’t give me food money now.

561
00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.920
then your death happens today.

562
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.060
Oggen. this is a baby I have in here.

563
00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.700
It is a baby!

564
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.500
Father…!

565
00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.740
Don’t touch me!

566
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.120
Let us go inside.

567
00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.080
move!

568
00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:17.920
Mbango

569
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:19.920

You should go back to your father’s house.

608
00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.400
A man doesn’t take his wife
into his father’s house.

609

I am warning you. Don’t mess with me.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.280
do you know who made you pregnant?

619
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.160
Do you even know who made you pregnant?

620
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.660
You must leave this compound!

621
00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:51.780
Useless girl!

622
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:52.320

mum its because of you i am tolerating...

624
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.280
You should instead leave the house.

625
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:54.780
(mum)Do you people want to kill me in this house?

626
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:55.860

627
00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:56.360
Useless Girl...

628
00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.660
nonsense girl

629
00:49:58.340 --> 00:49:58.935
It is your fault.

630
00:49:58.935 --> 00:49:59.435
What is it!

631
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.500
I will harass you again

632
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.380
Try daring me next time.

633
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.980
Is it because I decided to
get marry to your brother.

634
00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.080
I will teach you a lesson.

635
00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.980
You want to inherit your mother’s place.

636
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:08.480

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.640
He will come back.

640
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.600
He won’t.

641
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.400
What was I even thinking?

642
00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.220
Nobody likes me.

643
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.260
I am a fool.

644
00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.080
I am stupid.

645
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:48.240
Don’t talk like that.

646
00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.200
You a good child.

647
00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:55.840
Are you saying you don’t know that?

648
00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:01.440
Yes. you are a great child.

649
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:10.140
Let us go inside less
mosquitoes eat you up.

650
00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.220
I want to stay a little more.

651
00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.160
No

652
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:17.180
Come in. I am not leaving you here. let's go inside the house.

653
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.940
(dripping oil)

654
00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.620

655
00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:58.080

You haven’t even heard the question.

664
00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.800
I know it is about school.

665
00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.900

Now you have the audacity to question how many cones i have to make...

704
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.980
Watch your words!

705
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.380
Talking about university

706
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:12.440

Choice?

717
00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:37.820
When you choose to use
your family as an excuse

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.220
You are talking about choice?

719
00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.000

Johnny

801
01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:40.600

I said it

808
01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:05.260
This is a real witch!

809
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.060
Badluck has been on my heels all day.

810
01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:10.180
Here I am face to face with it here.

811
01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.120
This is a true witch right here.

812
01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.720
So you don't know a real witch?

813
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.720
No doubt.

814
01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.720
This is a real witch.

815
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.000
Oh no! Shut your mouth!

816
01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.180

What is it with you?

822
01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:30.720
You could have at least
shown some courtesy.

823
01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:31.900
And only speak out when she is gone.

824
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.420
You can’t always be running like mouth.

825
01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.160
If you were not my buddy you will leave

826
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:34.840
my house right now.

827
01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.720
You don't really have to mind Epie

828
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.280
Just a guy with the the big mouth

829
01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.680
You know him

830
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.820

You know.

832
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.220
About Mbango are you going
to bring her to burn fire?

833
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.860

That's it!

837
01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.520
Hope you remember our tradition

838
01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.400
No date no burn fire

839
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.040
I am part of the canton

But that makeup man....hahahahahahaha

845
01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.320
That is just how it started.

846
01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:16.680
Really?

847
01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:17.820
That is nice.

848
01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.760
Just a moment.

849
01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.280

850
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.480
Just read it.

851
01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:36.180
Sorry!

852
01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:38.360
I didn’t know you cannot read.

853
01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:49.580
Every time I went to school.

854
01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.480
other kids ran away from me.

855
01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.900
They said I looked like a witch.

856
01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.000
That I am witch.

857
01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.680
And my grandma didn’t have money to

858
01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.220
send me to school in a different town.

859
01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.540
What is written on it?

860
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:23.540
It is ‘John loves Mbango'…

861
01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.700
” No ‘John like Mbango plenty’

862
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.600
Don’t you like it?

863
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:33.440
I love it.

864
01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.100

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.580
What did you say......This witch?

890
01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.060

891
01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.440
John

892
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:53.020
Is this the only girl you
have seen in this village?

893
01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:56.700
This thing will not enter my house.

894
01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:03.220
And if you dont come to your senses. you too!

895
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.500
Epie. Look at what you did.

896

What did I do?

897
01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:10.580
You just go around running your mouth

898
01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.720
like an idiot.

899
01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:13.320
What is wrong with you?

900
01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.300

Her father got the news

927
01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.760
He felt and hit his head on a stone

928
01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.260
and died that day

929
01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.740
Now her Grandmother

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.720
I have something important

974
01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:29.440
to tell you all.

975
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.240
I think...

976
01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.200
I have not been a good father to you all.

977
01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:51.960
Father.

978
01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.360

979
01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.240
(Claps in awe)

980
01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:02.960
(sighs)

981
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.380
That didn’t come close.

982
01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.120
you didnt do well... Not even a bit!

983
01:15:55.580 --> 01:16:00.200
Its because you won’t prancing around.

984
01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.320
Leave me alone.

985
01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:10.180
Jesus

986
01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:13.780
Father

987
01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.340
Father

988
01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.040
Father

989
01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.760
John

990
01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:21.980
What is this?

991
01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:26.120
She doesn’t have a place to live.

992
01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:29.460
So what should we do now?

993
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:33.540
Why did you bring her here?

994
01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:34.040
mum. please!

995
01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.020
Begging for what John?

996
01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.840
Just take that ill-fated
girl out of my compound

997
01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.540
before I do the unspeakable.

998
01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.500
Stay if you have balls!

999
01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.600
Why run again?

1000
01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.760
Namundo. leave let me lay down.

1001
01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:56.060
Disturbing my dream about a beautiful girl.

1002
01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.200
Please don’t be mad.

1003
01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.100
I told you they won’t let me.

1004
01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.560
But we needed to be sure.

1005
01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:15.780
John

1006
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.620
Go back home.

1007
01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:22.460
I am a grown up. I can take care of myself.

1008
01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:24.220
I am used to

1009
01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.860
I cannot leave your by yourself.

1010
01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.840
John

1011
01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:17.720
Father please she just
lost her grandmother.

1012
01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.360
She does not have someone
to take care of her.

1013
01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:21.520
Please father.

1014
01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.660
Of all the girls in this village.

1015
01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:25.920
Is that the only one you can choose?

1016
01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:29.300
Why Mbango?

1017
01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.380
Why do you want to bring
a curse on this family?

1018
01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:36.620
Let my lady come leave her.

1019
01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.240
Get out of this house.

1020
01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.180
Don’t utter that nonsense again.

1021
01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.800
Father she is not well.

1022
01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.100
I said get of this house.

1023
01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:46.500
Father she is not well.

1024
01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.240
I said get of here my friend!

1025
01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.280
nonsense!

1026
01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:59.120
Let no one come looking for me.

1027
01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:09.540
John

1028
01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:11.280
Yes!

1029
01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:12.980
It is you I was coming to meet.

1030
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.180
I hope all is well

1031
01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:15.780
Yes. all is well.

1032
01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:19.160
I hear your family inherited
the palm plantation

1033
01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.120
from your grandfather.

1034
01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.120
Yes. it was he who left handed it to us.

1035
01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.220
I hope there is no problem.

1036
01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.200
No.

1037
01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.160
Do you now my brother?

1038
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.240
Hmmm. Andrew?

1039
01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.160
Yes.

1040
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.300
Andrew

1041
01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.060
Yes

1042
01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:37.800
We were in high school together

1043
01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.660
correct!

1044
01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:41.600
He wants to buy a piece of land.

1045
01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:43.220
Ok

1046
01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:46.160
That is why I wanted to meet you

1047
01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.060
and find out if you are
willing to sell that land.

1048
01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.060
No.

1049
01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.820
Am not selling piece of land

1050
01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:53.400
That piece of land is not for sale.

1051
01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.700
You won’t even stay let us talk about it.

1052
01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.020
No!

1053
01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:02.440
(bewildered)

1054
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.180
Father.

1055
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.460
How come you can afford
money for your drinks.

1056
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:25.620
but you cannot afford food money?

1057
01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:38.160
Can you tell me who made you pregnant?

1058
01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:42.920
Father.

1059
01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.740
Njanjo is right.

1060
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.600
Let us leave that topic.

1061
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:46.680
Father.

1062
01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.600
this thing with John and that girl.

1063
01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:51.680
what are we doing about it?

1064
01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.640
Starting tomorrow that nonsense stops.

1065
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.420
That is right!

1066
01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.740
It is important we sort it out now.

1067
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.720
Because it might take

1068
01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.280
a turn for the worse.

1069
01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:37.040
Thank you

1070
01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.040
You remember I taught you

1071
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.340
there are 26 letters of the alphabet?

1072
01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:43.840
Hmmm.

1073
01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.740
Can you remember?

1074
01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:48.660
You have forgotten?

1075
01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:52.220
The first one is. A

1076
01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.120
I remember that!

1077
01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:56.460
A. B. C. D

1078
01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:57.700
Let us start and recite it till the end.

1079
01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.460
(Reciting)

1080
01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:08.940
(Reciting the Alphabet)

1081
01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.060
I forgot the others.

1082
01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.540
I thought you were smarter than everyone.

1083
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.940
So you too forgot?

1084
01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.980
I am smart. You think I am not smart.

1085
01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:20.720
Then remember the others.

1086
01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:22.220
(Recites the Alphabet)

1087
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.560
Wow. there are many.

1088
01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:40.000
They are just 26.

1089
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:47.400
listen up..Can you all tell me when John

1090
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:50.180
started seeing this girl?

1091
01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.360
Father I can’t really tell.

1092
01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.860
we dont know!

1093
01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.700
You don’t now?

1094
01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.000
Nobody knows

1095
01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:03.480
Do you realise that now she is got him

1096
01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.880
wrapped around her finger.

1097
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.940
all the money John makes

1098
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.940
is going to go to her?

1099
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.700
All the money that was supposed

1100
01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:16.580
to help in taking care of this family

1101
01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.600
will go to that witch.

1102
01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.680
Witch

1103
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.700
I will do something.

1104
01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:29.100
I think John is a grown up.

1105
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.500
Let him do as he pleases.

1106
01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.020
Let him do as he pleases huh?

1107
01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:36.960
She can say that because

1108
01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.340
she has young guys who provide for her.

1109
01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.400
John is a grown up.

1110
01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.760
He knows what is good for him.

1111
01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.840
Nonsense. Shut that trap.

1112
01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.760
Nonsense. Shut that trap.

1113
01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:53.180
Hmmm.

1114
01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.260
I think I have an idea.

1115
01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.000
Huh!

1116
01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:06.020
Say what?

1117
01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:07.280
I have an idea.

1118
01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:09.580
What is the idea?

1119
01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.880
Apple.

1120
01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.140
Apple the fruit.

1121
01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:14.020
Apple

1122
01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:17.760
The first letter in front is A.

1123
01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.180
Apple

1124
01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.940
Apple

1125
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.400
Apple

1126
01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.440
Apple

1127
01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:28.140
This first sound in front of the image Egg

1128
01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:32.260
Say E ‘egg’.

1129
01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:33.160
Egg

1130
01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.180
Egg

1131
01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:35.600
Egg

1132
01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:38.540
That is it.

1133
01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:42.340
It is even in your name ‘M Mbango’

1134
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:43.880
Mbango’

1135
01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.940
Mbango

1136
01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.360
There is the A sound.

1137
01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:50.540
It must not be in the
beginning of the word.

1138
01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:52.060
They could be in the middle of it.

1139
01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.400
at the end too.

1140
01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.600
Mbango

1141

Is he coming to take a wife?

1185
01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.080

1186
01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:41.780
No. Not that!

1187
01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:44.000
He wants to buy a piece of land

1188
01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.360
So I wish to find out

1189
01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:48.060

1190
01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:56.300

1191
01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.620

01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:00.860
You think I would go without

1304
01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:03.140
bidding you farewell.

1305
01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:09.180
I am sorry about the attitude of my sisters.

1306
01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.640

1307
01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:18.620

1309
01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:26.740
The doctor says you need to eat something.

1310
01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:30.220
I am not hungry.

1311
01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:37.140
I want to feel the sun rays on my face while sitting outside

1312
01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:11.840
Can we go back inside?

1313
01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.680
Let us stay a little more.

1314
01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.760
The doctor says you should go back inside.

1315
01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:24.300
I saw my mother.

1316
01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:26.780
What did you say?

1317
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.040
She was so beautiful..

1318
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:41.660
She wanted me to stay with her but…

1319
01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:43.580
But what?

1320
01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.820
I wanted to come bid farewell.

1321
01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:54.740
I am calling the doctor.

1322
01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.520
John

1323
01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.740
I dont have an ounce of strength to fight anymore.

1324
01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.700
Stop the silly talk!

1325
01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.700
Please let me go!

1326
01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:13.420
Go to where?

1327
01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:17.060
I am exhausted.

1328
01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.800
(nostalgic laughter)
