00:07:51.278 --> 00:07:52.241
- [Woman] I fucking hate you!

187
00:07:52.277 --> 00:07:53.545
- [Man] Relax!

188
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.310
- [Woman] You didn't
come home last night.

189
00:07:55.346 --> 00:07:56.411
You're a liar.

190
00:07:56.446 --> 00:07:57.512
- [Man] Calm down.

191
00:07:57.547 --> 00:07:59.313
- [Woman] You're a liar.

192
00:07:59.348 --> 00:08:00.417
- Wow.

193
00:08:00.452 --> 00:08:02.688
- [Man] What are you doing?

194
00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:06.252
(cloth rips)

195
00:08:08.623 --> 00:08:09.823
- Listen. Abby.

196
00:08:09.859 --> 00:08:11.728
tuition payments
need to be issued

197
00:08:11.763 --> 00:08:13.895
through a bank account
or a credit card.

198
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.530
There is accountability
to be considered.

199
00:08:15.566 --> 00:08:17.733
not to mention the taxes.

200
00:08:17.769 --> 00:08:19.604
- I'm in the process
of setting one up.

201
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.872
- [Bursar] Can't your
parents help you out?

202
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.806
- It's complicated.

203
00:08:24.842 --> 00:08:26.905
My mom. I haven't
spoken to in years.

204
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.585
and my dad is not the best guy.

205
00:08:32.783 --> 00:08:33.881
- I'll allow it
for this semester.

206
00:08:33.916 --> 00:08:35.785
but sort yourself
out a bank account

207
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.254
because this will not
be happening again.

208
00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.225
- Thank you.

209
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.624
Thank you. thank you. thank you.

210
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.459
So I talked to the
bursar this morning

211
00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:43.761
and she ended up
taking the cash.

212
00:08:43.796 --> 00:08:46.292
I mean. at least I'm
covered for the semester.

213
00:08:46.327 --> 00:08:48.429
- [America] Oh. what happens
when the money runs out?

214
00:08:48.465 --> 00:08:49.799
- I don't know.

215
00:08:49.834 --> 00:08:51.632
I'll find a job or
I'll get a scholarship.

216
00:08:51.668 --> 00:08:53.004
I'll figure something out.

217
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.838
Incoming.

218
00:08:55.142 --> 00:08:56.208
- Hey. pumpkin.

219
00:08:56.243 --> 00:08:57.671
I got you a coffee here.

220
00:08:57.706 --> 00:08:58.607
- Thank you.
- Aw.

221
00:08:58.642 --> 00:09:00.275
- [Shepley] That's for you.

222
00:09:00.311 --> 00:09:01.114
- Thanks.

223
00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:02.477
- How was last night?

224
00:09:02.512 --> 00:09:03.380
Did you have fun?

225
00:09:03.416 --> 00:09:04.780
- Yeah. it was memorable.

226
00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:06.078
So what was the deal
with the one guy.

227
00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:08.154
the guy that was
covered in tattoos?

228
00:09:08.189 --> 00:09:09.022
- Oh. that's his cousin.

229
00:09:09.057 --> 00:09:10.586
He's a sophomore.

230
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:12.751
- Oh. that guy goes to college?

231
00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:13.687
- [America] Mm-hm.

232
00:09:13.723 --> 00:09:15.393
- Wow. that is surprising.

233
00:09:15.428 --> 00:09:16.391
- [Travis] What's surprising?

234
00:09:16.426 --> 00:09:17.693
(Abby gasps)

235
00:09:17.729 --> 00:09:18.691
- [Shepley] That
you go to college.

236
00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:19.628
(Shepley giggles)

237
00:09:19.663 --> 00:09:20.895
- Why can't I go to college?

238
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:21.527
- I didn't say it.
bro. she said it.

239
00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:22.531
- What?

240
00:09:22.566 --> 00:09:23.433
No. I didn't say that.

241
00:09:23.468 --> 00:09:24.733
- Sorry. have we met?

242
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:25.766
- Oh. you don't
remember. Travis?

243
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:27.306
You. you ruined her sweater.

244
00:09:27.341 --> 00:09:28.906
- I ruin a lot of sweaters.

245
00:09:28.941 --> 00:09:31.141
- I'm pretty sure they
retired bad double entendres.

246
00:09:31.177 --> 00:09:32.406
- Pigeon.

247
00:09:32.441 --> 00:09:33.210
- Abby.

248
00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:34.980
My name is Abby.

249
00:09:35.016 --> 00:09:35.608
- Travis.

250
00:09:35.644 --> 00:09:36.983
Travis Maddox.

251
00:09:37.018 --> 00:09:38.383
(lips smack)

252
00:09:38.418 --> 00:09:39.680
- Does that move really work?

253
00:09:39.715 --> 00:09:41.582
- No. not a single time.

254
00:09:41.617 --> 00:09:42.821
but it is sincere.

255
00:09:43.587 --> 00:09:45.422
- You're not my type.

256
00:09:45.457 --> 00:09:46.993
- I'm everybody's type.

257
00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:47.587
(Abby giggles)

258
00:09:47.623 --> 00:09:48.722
See. I got you.

259
00:09:48.758 --> 00:09:49.823
I got a smile out of you.

260
00:09:49.858 --> 00:09:51.894
- No. no. that was not a smile.

261
00:09:51.929 --> 00:09:53.900
That was actually a
condescending chuckle.

262
00:09:53.935 --> 00:09:54.734
- Yeah.

263
00:09:56.735 --> 00:09:58.771
Hey. I'm gonna come
over. all right?

264
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.501
See you later. pigeon.

265
00:10:00.537 --> 00:10:01.537
(chair clanks)

266
00:10:01.572 --> 00:10:02.539
- Abby. my name is Abby.

267
00:10:02.575 --> 00:10:03.705
- [Travis] Well.
it's pigeon now.

268
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.206
- Can you believe that guy?

269
00:10:06.512 --> 00:10:07.841
- And that is what brings us

270
00:10:07.876 --> 00:10:10.476
to the discovery of game theory.

271
00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:15.755
Now. game theory is a term
that was pioneered in the 1950s

272
00:10:16.555 --> 00:10:17.755
by mathematician John Nash.

273
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.721
The term game is defined
as any interaction

274
00:10:20.757 --> 00:10:22.693
where each person's payoff

275
00:10:22.728 --> 00:10:24.756
is affected by the decisions.
- Mm.

276
00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:28.065
(gentle music)

277
00:10:28.101 --> 00:10:28.834
Wow.

278
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:37.810
So hot.

279
00:10:40.447 --> 00:10:41.715
- That one's my favorite.

280
00:10:43.582 --> 00:10:45.246
It's too late to close it now.

281
00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:49.088
- Has anyone ever told you
that it's not very polite.

282
00:10:49.124 --> 00:10:50.086
- Young lady?

283
00:10:51.555 --> 00:10:53.091
What is your name?

284
00:10:53.126 --> 00:10:54.594
- Abby.

285
00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:57.226
- Ms. Abby. would you
care to educate us

286
00:10:57.261 --> 00:11:00.561
as to why Nash's equilibrium
is irrelevant to game theory?

287
00:11:00.597 --> 00:11:02.100
- Irrelevant?

288
00:11:02.135 --> 00:11:03.770
I can't.

289
00:11:03.805 --> 00:11:05.231
- Well. then perhaps you
should focus a little more on.

290
00:11:05.266 --> 00:11:07.967
- Well. but that's
because it is relevant.

291
00:11:08.002 --> 00:11:09.809
If equilibrium is achieved.

292
00:11:09.844 --> 00:11:11.808
that means that both players
can't increase payoff

293
00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:14.107
by changing decisions
unilaterally.

294
00:11:14.142 --> 00:11:15.914
It can also be
known as no regrets

295
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:17.509
in the sense that once a
player does make a decision.

296
00:11:17.544 --> 00:11:20.787
they'll have no regrets
thinking about the consequences.

297
00:11:21.587 --> 00:11:23.990
- Have you been reading ahead?

298
00:11:24.025 --> 00:11:24.824
- A bit.

299
00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:27.789
- As I was saying.

300
00:11:27.824 --> 00:11:29.491
- Wow. pigeon. that was so hot.

301
00:11:29.527 --> 00:11:30.456
You got brains.

302
00:11:31.464 --> 00:11:32.698
- Why are you here?

303
00:11:32.733 --> 00:11:34.161
- Why are you sending
me a mixed signal?

304
00:11:34.196 --> 00:11:35.799
- There's nothing
mixed about my signals.

305
00:11:35.835 --> 00:11:37.733
- I just caught you
Insta stalking me.

306
00:11:37.768 --> 00:11:40.333
- I was not Insta stalking.

307
00:11:40.369 --> 00:11:42.804
Look. I'm going to save
you a lot of wasted time.

308
00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:44.574
You can stop the antics. okay?

309
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.877
I'm not sleeping with you.

310
00:11:45.912 --> 00:11:48.746
- I'm not trying to sleep
with you or bag you.

311
00:11:48.782 --> 00:11:50.049
I'm just trying to
take you to dinner.

312
00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:51.251
- Bag me?

313
00:11:51.286 --> 00:11:52.918
What am I. groceries?

314
00:11:52.953 --> 00:11:55.081
Have you not read a newspaper
in the last four years?

315
00:11:55.117 --> 00:11:56.716
Men don't talk
like that anymore.

316
00:11:56.751 --> 00:11:57.923
- Which men?

317
00:11:59.022 --> 00:12:01.960
- The evolved men
of planet Earth.

318
00:12:01.996 --> 00:12:04.490
The ones who are actually in
touch with their feelings.

319
00:12:06.696 --> 00:12:07.933
I don't like you.

320
00:12:09.599 --> 00:12:10.400
(Abby sighs)

321
00:12:10.436 --> 00:12:11.937
Leave me alone.

322
00:12:14.676 --> 00:12:17.102
You're not going to let
this go. aren't you?

323
00:12:17.137 --> 00:12:18.878
- I'll pick you up at eight.

324
00:12:19.845 --> 00:12:21.780
- But wait. you
don't have my number.

325
00:12:21.815 --> 00:12:24.183
- [Professor] Interest
to play his part.

326
00:12:24.218 --> 00:12:25.285
(Abby sighs)

327
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.481
(motor engine revving)

328
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.457
(crickets chirping)

329
00:12:34.493 --> 00:12:36.792
(Travis sighs)

330
00:12:36.827 --> 00:12:38.161
- [Travis] You dress up for me?

331
00:12:38.196 --> 00:12:41.665
- No. I didn't have to
because this is not a date.

332
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.664
- Well. I hope you're hungry.

333
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.467
(helmet thuds)

334
00:12:44.503 --> 00:12:46.137
- No. no. no.

335
00:12:46.172 --> 00:12:48.471
I don't need this because I'm
not getting on that thing.

336
00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:50.141
- Yeah. you are.

337
00:12:50.176 --> 00:12:52.304
- Do you know the statistics
of motorcycles in accidents?

338
00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:55.313
No. I'm not putting
on that thing.

339
00:12:55.349 --> 00:12:56.447
- Yeah. you are.

340
00:12:56.482 --> 00:12:59.880
(helmet thudding)

341
00:12:59.915 --> 00:13:01.987
I can do this all night.

342
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.991
- (sighs) Fine.

343
00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:08.594
(scanner beeps)

344
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.159
- [Travis] Thanks. Miguel.
- Yep.

345
00:13:11.295 --> 00:13:12.959
- You're really not gonna
let me buy you dinner?

346
00:13:12.994 --> 00:13:14.835
- No. this isn't a date.

347
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.667
- Yes. I'm aware.

348
00:13:16.702 --> 00:13:18.030
You've said that twice now.

349
00:13:18.066 --> 00:13:19.237
- [Abby] Oh. you noticed.

350
00:13:19.272 --> 00:13:20.604
- Mm-hm.

351
00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:21.804
That and your outfit.

352
00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:23.805
which screams "I detest Travis."

353
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.107
- I don't detest you.

354
00:13:25.143 --> 00:13:27.376
I just don't like being
a foregone conclusion

355
00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:31.449
for one of the many. many.
many notches on your bedpost.

356
00:13:31.485 --> 00:13:32.779
- Oh. you're smart.

357
00:13:32.814 --> 00:13:34.382
I like that.

358
00:13:34.417 --> 00:13:35.982
- Something you're probably
not used to in a woman.

359
00:13:36.017 --> 00:13:38.488
- Oh. I'm striking out.

360
00:13:38.523 --> 00:13:39.921
I surrender.

361
00:13:39.956 --> 00:13:41.461
We can at least be friends.

362
00:13:41.496 --> 00:13:43.061
- Friends. but with no benefits.

363
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.764
- We're not sleeping together.

364
00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:47.664
I won't even think
about the benefits

365
00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:49.100
unless you want me to.

366
00:13:49.135 --> 00:13:52.037
- No. that can't happen so
that we can stay friends.

367
00:13:53.373 --> 00:13:54.204
- Friends.

368
00:13:55.242 --> 00:13:56.041
Friends.

369
00:13:58.043 --> 00:13:59.977
I've been coming to
this place for years.

370
00:14:00.013 --> 00:14:02.214
My family home is only
three miles that way.

371
00:14:02.249 --> 00:14:03.344
- Aw.

372
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.681
You couldn't move farther
away from your mommy?

373
00:14:05.717 --> 00:14:06.953
- No. that's not it.

374
00:14:08.053 --> 00:14:10.554
- Her grilled cheese
was just that good?

375
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.985
- Well. she's dead.

376
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.157
- (chuckles) Shut up.

377
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.594
Are you serious?

378
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:19.930
(Travis chuckles)

379
00:14:19.965 --> 00:14:22.361
I'm such an asshole.
I'm so sorry.

380
00:14:22.396 --> 00:14:24.029
I feel horrible.
- It's okay. it's okay.

381
00:14:24.064 --> 00:14:25.703
I was only three.

382
00:14:25.738 --> 00:14:27.000
- Okay. I'm not that sorry.

383
00:14:27.035 --> 00:14:28.073
Get your hand off me.

384
00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:31.076
How's your dad?

385
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:33.774
- He's still alive. so
you can make fun of him.

386
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:34.577
(Abby chuckles)

387
00:14:34.613 --> 00:14:35.847
He's a good man.

388
00:14:35.882 --> 00:14:37.076
He raised five boys
all on his own.

389
00:14:37.111 --> 00:14:38.679
- Five Maddox brothers?

390
00:14:38.714 --> 00:14:40.116
- Yeah.

391
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:42.153
Thomas. Taylor. Tyler.
Trent. and Travis.

392
00:14:43.318 --> 00:14:45.056
If you wanna get
good at fighting.

393
00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:46.118
having four older brothers
beat your ass daily

394
00:14:46.154 --> 00:14:47.491
is a good place to start.

395
00:14:47.526 --> 00:14:48.291
- Why do it?

396
00:14:49.761 --> 00:14:51.060
- College ain't cheap.

397
00:14:51.095 --> 00:14:52.764
Fighting is a good
way to make money.

398
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.300
- Just seems
unnecessarily risky.

399
00:14:55.335 --> 00:14:56.436
- Why?

400
00:14:56.471 --> 00:14:57.735
You worried about me?

401
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.533
- Not even in the slightest.

402
00:15:01.003 --> 00:15:02.567
- What's your story?

403
00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:05.807
- Just your average girl
from your ordinary town.

404
00:15:05.842 --> 00:15:08.039
- Oh. mom and dad?

405
00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:09.177
- One of each.

406
00:15:09.212 --> 00:15:11.347
- Wow. you're a
wealth of information.

407
00:15:11.383 --> 00:15:13.483
- Well. I can't give away
all the goods in one night.

408
00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:14.816
- Most do.

409
00:15:14.852 --> 00:15:16.121
I actually enjoy it.

410
00:15:17.823 --> 00:15:19.050
Are you seriously leaving?

411
00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:20.625
- Dinner's over.

412
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.127
- We just got started.

413
00:15:22.695 --> 00:15:23.997
- Good night. Travis.

414
00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:27.193
(car door thuds)

415
00:15:27.228 --> 00:15:31.070
(gentle instrumental music)

416
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:35.772
- Hey. purple sweater.

417
00:15:35.807 --> 00:15:37.241
Little help?
- Yeah.

418
00:15:39.007 --> 00:15:39.741
(frisbee thuds)

419
00:15:39.777 --> 00:15:40.743
- [Crowd] Ooh!

420
00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:42.040
- Oh. no! (grunting)

421
00:15:42.076 --> 00:15:43.141
- Oh. my god.

422
00:15:43.176 --> 00:15:44.780
(Parker grunting)

423
00:15:44.816 --> 00:15:45.616
- [Passerby] Police.

424
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:47.420
- He's. he's fine.

425
00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:48.354
(Parker grunting)

426
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:48.914
Okay. it's okay.

427
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.048
He's okay.

428
00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:51.084
- I'm fine.

429
00:15:51.119 --> 00:15:52.358
- Okay. are you okay?

430
00:15:52.394 --> 00:15:53.387
- Oh. I'm fine.

431
00:15:53.422 --> 00:15:55.261
- Okay. I'm so sorry.
(Parker grunting)

432
00:15:55.297 --> 00:15:56.360
- Oh. God.

433
00:15:56.396 --> 00:15:57.422
Oh!

434
00:15:57.458 --> 00:15:58.929
- You're so cute
and you're crying.

435
00:15:58.965 --> 00:16:00.192
I swear.
- I'm not. I'm not crying.

436
00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:02.498
It's. uh. it's the wind.

437
00:16:02.534 --> 00:16:04.902
How long have you been captain
of the Frisbee club? (groans)

438
00:16:04.938 --> 00:16:06.366
- Oh. no. no. no.
I'm not captain

439
00:16:06.402 --> 00:16:07.373
of the Frisbee club.
- Oh. it was. uh.

440
00:16:07.409 --> 00:16:08.102
it was a joke.

441
00:16:08.137 --> 00:16:09.508
It was a joke. I'll be okay.

442
00:16:09.544 --> 00:16:10.475
- Oh. hi.
- Hi.

443
00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:12.345
- Hi. I'm Abby.

444
00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:12.974
- I'm gonna go.

445
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:15.178
I'm. I'm gonna wobble.

446
00:16:15.213 --> 00:16:16.981
- You should put some
ice on your balls.

447
00:16:17.016 --> 00:16:19.177
- You should put
some ice on my balls.

448
00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:20.281
- Okay. (chuckles)

449
00:16:20.316 --> 00:16:22.482
- [Parker] Oh.
yeah. I'm gonna go.

450
00:16:22.517 --> 00:16:24.722
- It was really nice
to meet you. Parker.

451
00:16:24.758 --> 00:16:25.558
(ball whooshes and thuds)

452
00:16:25.593 --> 00:16:27.360
Oh!
(Parker groans)

453
00:16:27.396 --> 00:16:28.461
- Thanks. man.

454
00:16:28.496 --> 00:16:29.362
- [Man] Fuck you!

455
00:16:29.398 --> 00:16:30.327
- Be careful!

456
00:16:31.499 --> 00:16:34.364
(water splashing)

457
00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:39.204
(gentle instrumental music)

458
00:16:40.242 --> 00:16:41.074
Ow!

459
00:16:42.343 --> 00:16:43.238
Ow.

460
00:16:43.273 --> 00:16:45.378
Could someone turn
the water back on?

461
00:16:45.414 --> 00:16:46.473
(bags thudding)

462
00:16:46.508 --> 00:16:48.377
So the RA said we're
gonna be without water

463
00:16:48.413 --> 00:16:50.982
for the next 24 hours. so
it's just for the night.

464
00:16:51.018 --> 00:16:53.180
Are you sure Shepley
is cool with this?

465
00:16:53.215 --> 00:16:55.218
- Hey. Abby's staying over.

466
00:16:55.254 --> 00:16:57.488
- Just stay out of
Travis's room. all right?

467
00:16:57.523 --> 00:16:58.051
- What?

468
00:16:58.086 --> 00:16:59.354
You didn't tell me

469
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.285
that Travis lives here.
- No. of course I did.

470
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:00.987
No. remember. I told you.

471
00:17:01.023 --> 00:17:02.158
No. no. no. no.

472
00:17:02.193 --> 00:17:03.224
no. no. no.
- I'm not staying here.

473
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.425
- Abby. Abby!
- No. I'm leaving.

474
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.961
- No. I promise you
will never see him.

475
00:17:05.996 --> 00:17:06.930
He's never even here.

476
00:17:06.965 --> 00:17:08.163
You won't see him. I promise.

477
00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:09.363
You have to stay.
It'll be so fun.

478
00:17:09.399 --> 00:17:11.432
Hey. tell her that
Travis will be okay.

479
00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:12.638
- [Shepley] Oh. he won't
care. he likes you.

480
00:17:12.673 --> 00:17:13.736
- He doesn't know me.

481
00:17:13.772 --> 00:17:14.707
- He likes you.

482
00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:15.675
We're gonna have a sleepover.

483
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.509
So much fun. we'll make s'mores.

484
00:17:17.545 --> 00:17:18.476
Hey. let's go.

485
00:17:18.511 --> 00:17:19.609
- Bye.

486
00:17:19.644 --> 00:17:20.410
- Bye.

487
00:17:21.813 --> 00:17:25.146
(crowd chattering)

488
00:17:25.181 --> 00:17:28.451
- [Mick] Abby. babe. it's Dad.

489
00:17:29.656 --> 00:17:31.322
Where'd you go?

490
00:17:31.357 --> 00:17:35.392
Could you return the call
or at least text me back?

491
00:17:37.829 --> 00:17:40.394
(Carmen moaning)

492
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.800
(Carmen speaking in
foreign language)

493
00:17:44.836 --> 00:17:46.103
(door clicks)

494
00:17:46.139 --> 00:17:49.541
(Carmen speaking in
foreign language)

495
00:17:49.577 --> 00:17:50.608
(Carmen moaning)

496
00:17:50.643 --> 00:17:51.637
(door thuds)

497
00:17:51.672 --> 00:17:52.973
- [Abby] Shit. shit.
shit. shit. shit. shit.

498
00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:53.811
(gentle music)

499
00:17:53.846 --> 00:17:55.812
(door creaks and clicks)

500
00:17:55.848 --> 00:17:57.348
(footsteps tapping)

501
00:17:57.383 --> 00:17:59.683
- [Carmen] Excuse me.
(speaks in foreign language)

502
00:17:59.719 --> 00:18:00.312
- [Abby] Sure.

503
00:18:00.347 --> 00:18:01.385
- [Carmen] Okay. merci.

504
00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:07.493
(door thuds)

505
00:18:07.529 --> 00:18:09.822
(gentle music)

506
00:18:18.738 --> 00:18:19.804
(floor creaks)

507
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.266
- [Abby] (screams) Jesus.

508
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:22.236
- Enjoy the show?

509
00:18:22.271 --> 00:18:23.570
- You scared the crap out of me.

510
00:18:23.606 --> 00:18:25.405
- You know that's not
a very attractive idiom

511
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:26.978
once you stop and
think about it.

512
00:18:27.014 --> 00:18:28.506
- Because in your
sexist universe.

513
00:18:28.541 --> 00:18:30.413
women don't actually defecate?

514
00:18:30.449 --> 00:18:32.615
- Wow. that's a perfect
word for someone like you.

515
00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:36.220
Did you know that the saying
used to be "bejesus out of me?"

516
00:18:36.256 --> 00:18:39.219
- Your friend gave this
to me to give to you.

517
00:18:39.255 --> 00:18:41.119
(paper crumples and thuds)

518
00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:42.456
What?

519
00:18:42.491 --> 00:18:43.755
The woman that you
just had sex with

520
00:18:43.791 --> 00:18:46.229
gives you her number and
you just throw it away?

521
00:18:46.264 --> 00:18:47.900
- That's not her
leaving her number.

522
00:18:47.936 --> 00:18:49.532
That's her marking
her territory.

523
00:18:49.567 --> 00:18:51.433
- Well. then maybe you
shouldn't have sex with her.

524
00:18:51.468 --> 00:18:53.670
- I don't remember
promising her a thing.

525
00:18:53.705 --> 00:18:54.900
- Wow.

526
00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:56.773
You embody everything that
is wrong with your gender.

527
00:18:56.809 --> 00:18:57.774
She's an adult.

528
00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:58.776
I'm an adult.

529
00:18:58.811 --> 00:19:00.271
It was consensual.

530
00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:01.811
Look at this.

531
00:19:01.847 --> 00:19:03.445
- Consent date.

532
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:05.150
- [Travis] Can never be
too careful nowadays.

533
00:19:05.185 --> 00:19:06.945
- How many women do you
have contracts with?

534
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.514
- [Travis] No idea. I'm a
quality guy over quantity.

535
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:11.649
- (groans) I'm gonna throw up.

536
00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:13.456
- Well. my bedroom
is down the hall

537
00:19:13.492 --> 00:19:15.554
and the bed is all yours
for when you wanna crash.

538
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:16.825
- I'm not gonna
sleep in your bed.

539
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.929
- Why?

540
00:19:17.964 --> 00:19:19.897
No one but me sleeps in my bed.

541
00:19:19.932 --> 00:19:21.166
My bed is sacred ground.

542
00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.796
- Well. then why would I
be allowed in your bed?

543
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:24.866
- Are you planning on
having sex with me tonight?

544
00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:25.733
- No.

545
00:19:26.906 --> 00:19:27.933
- Then it's settled.

546
00:19:31.778 --> 00:19:33.945
(door clicks)

547
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.612
Wow. make yourself at home.

548
00:19:35.647 --> 00:19:38.281
- Sorry. I just have a big
10 a.m. Bio test to cram for.

549
00:19:38.316 --> 00:19:39.646
but I can move back
to the kitchen.

550
00:19:39.681 --> 00:19:41.017
- No. you're fine.
stay where you're at.

551
00:19:41.052 --> 00:19:42.181
Don't be silly. (groans)

552
00:19:42.216 --> 00:19:43.552
- Thank you.

553
00:19:43.588 --> 00:19:44.816
- Do you want me to make
you some tea or something?

554
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:47.055
- No. but. uh. my
highlighter just died.

555
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.356
Can I borrow one?

556
00:19:48.392 --> 00:19:49.790
- Oh. yeah. check
the top drawer.

557
00:19:52.061 --> 00:19:52.926
Wait. um.

558
00:19:52.962 --> 00:19:53.794
no.

559
00:19:55.096 --> 00:19:56.800
- Wow.

560
00:19:56.836 --> 00:19:57.829
That's a lot.

561
00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:00.768
- Is practicing safe
sex a crime? (chuckles)

562
00:20:02.611 --> 00:20:03.671
- What's this?

563
00:20:03.706 --> 00:20:05.073
- It's not a highlighter.
I'll tell you that.

564
00:20:05.108 --> 00:20:08.281
(device vibrating)

565
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.078
Um.

566
00:20:11.114 --> 00:20:11.949
- It's a yo-yo?

567
00:20:11.984 --> 00:20:13.916
- No. definitely not.

568
00:20:13.952 --> 00:20:14.819
It's awkward.

569
00:20:14.855 --> 00:20:16.421
I'm gonna go shower.

570
00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:25.463
(disinfectant hissing)

571
00:20:26.866 --> 00:20:29.599
(device vibrating)

572
00:20:30.969 --> 00:20:34.300
(Travis whistling)

573
00:20:34.336 --> 00:20:37.442
(crickets chirping)

574
00:20:39.978 --> 00:20:42.513
(gentle music)

575
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:02.962
(Travis sighs)

576
00:21:11.177 --> 00:21:16.045
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

577
00:21:16.081 --> 00:21:19.451
(singers vocalizing)

578
00:21:26.521 --> 00:21:30.660
- (giggling) What are you doing?

579
00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:34.667
(cat squeaking)

580
00:21:34.703 --> 00:21:36.936
(Abby laughs)

581
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:38.803
Bad kitty.
(cat squeaking)

582
00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:41.673
Mouse. (giggles)

583
00:21:41.708 --> 00:21:42.771
Mouse.

584
00:21:45.275 --> 00:21:48.573
(Abby giggling)
- Abby.

585
00:21:48.608 --> 00:21:50.715
Pigeon.
- Really cute.

586
00:21:50.751 --> 00:21:51.483
How much?

587
00:21:52.213 --> 00:21:53.579
- Um.

588
00:21:53.615 --> 00:21:56.620
It's not what do
you think it is.

589
00:21:58.155 --> 00:21:59.222
Abby. you're.

590
00:21:59.257 --> 00:22:01.287
- Wait. what are you doing?

591
00:22:01.323 --> 00:22:03.125
(Abby screaming)

592
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.225
(wings whooshing)

593
00:22:05.261 --> 00:22:07.228
(door clicks)

594
00:22:07.263 --> 00:22:08.295
- [Shepley] Abby!

595
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.363
- [America] Abby!

596
00:22:09.399 --> 00:22:10.332
- [Travis] What the heck?

597
00:22:10.367 --> 00:22:11.266
- [Abby] What is wrong with you?

598
00:22:11.301 --> 00:22:12.034
- I didn't do anything.

599
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.272
You touched me.

600
00:22:13.307 --> 00:22:14.973
- Oh. says the man with
the raging hard-on.

601
00:22:15.008 --> 00:22:16.208
You should be locked up.

602
00:22:16.243 --> 00:22:17.537
- You're the sleepy
cock toucher.

603
00:22:17.572 --> 00:22:19.410
I didn't put your hand there.

604
00:22:19.446 --> 00:22:21.307
And if you bothered to
read a biology textbook.

605
00:22:21.343 --> 00:22:22.710
you'd find out

606
00:22:22.746 --> 00:22:23.909
that it's called
parasympathetic nerve response

607
00:22:23.944 --> 00:22:24.983
and you'd know that
if you knew anything

608
00:22:25.018 --> 00:22:26.345
about biology or men.

609
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:27.885
- Oh. shit. Bio!

610
00:22:27.921 --> 00:22:28.819
What time is it?

611
00:22:28.854 --> 00:22:29.821
- 9:42.

612
00:22:29.857 --> 00:22:30.583
- Oh. my God.

613
00:22:30.618 --> 00:22:32.618
- [Both] What are you wearing?

614
00:22:32.654 --> 00:22:33.593
- We were playing.
- We were

615
00:22:33.628 --> 00:22:34.460
playing.

616
00:22:35.491 --> 00:22:36.424
- Let me give you a ride.

617
00:22:36.459 --> 00:22:38.464
- No. this is just a madhouse.

618
00:22:39.667 --> 00:22:40.832
A nurse?

619
00:22:40.868 --> 00:22:41.698
- Yeah. no. I.

620
00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:43.530
- Sorry. excuse me.

621
00:22:43.565 --> 00:22:45.836
(gentle instrumental music)

622
00:22:45.871 --> 00:22:46.937
Sorry.

623
00:22:46.972 --> 00:22:47.938
Oh. my God!

624
00:22:47.974 --> 00:22:50.168
(Abby groans)

625
00:22:51.307 --> 00:22:54.414
(crowd chattering)

626
00:22:55.278 --> 00:22:57.813
(phone beeps)

627
00:22:59.149 --> 00:23:00.547
I slipped.

628
00:23:00.582 --> 00:23:02.247
But I still aced my Bio test.

629
00:23:02.282 --> 00:23:04.955
- (chuckles) Well. I'm glad
you're not drawing attention

630
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.550
to yourself.

631
00:23:05.586 --> 00:23:07.455
- [Abby] Hilarious.

632
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.990
- Okay. I have to run to class.

633
00:23:09.025 --> 00:23:10.326
but I want a full play-by-play
of what happened last night.

634
00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:11.393
- Nothing happened last night.

635
00:23:11.428 --> 00:23:12.126
- Yeah?
- I do not like him.

636
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:13.565
- Yeah.

637
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:14.393
and that's why you're giving
him a good morning handy.

638
00:23:14.429 --> 00:23:15.963
(phone beeps)

639
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.871
Is Mick still bothering you?

640
00:23:19.907 --> 00:23:20.965
- [Abby] Yeah.

641
00:23:21.001 --> 00:23:22.909
- You got to cut him
out of your life.

642
00:23:22.944 --> 00:23:24.109
- He is out of my life.

643
00:23:24.144 --> 00:23:25.110
- He is not out of your life

644
00:23:25.145 --> 00:23:26.473
because he is still texting you.

645
00:23:26.508 --> 00:23:28.043
I-I gotta go to class.

646
00:23:28.078 --> 00:23:28.844
- What?

647
00:23:32.346 --> 00:23:33.480
- Hey.

648
00:23:33.515 --> 00:23:35.350
Parker. we meet again.

649
00:23:35.385 --> 00:23:37.884
- Abby. are you okay?

650
00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:40.555
- Yeah. yeah. it's a
long story. (chuckles)

651
00:23:40.591 --> 00:23:42.858
Hey. um. how are
your. your balls?

652
00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:44.357
- Not good.

653
00:23:44.393 --> 00:23:45.391
- Oh. my God.

654
00:23:45.427 --> 00:23:47.028
- That's okay.

655
00:23:47.063 --> 00:23:50.668
I think they said I had a 20%
chance of a normal sex life.

656
00:23:52.601 --> 00:23:53.531
- Are you messing with me?

657
00:23:53.566 --> 00:23:54.634
- Not funny?

658
00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:57.371
- No. it was. it was hilarious.

659
00:23:57.407 --> 00:23:59.641
Well. um. okay. bye.

660
00:23:59.676 --> 00:24:01.373
- Do you have dinner
plans tonight?

661
00:24:01.408 --> 00:24:02.979
- Me?

662
00:24:03.014 --> 00:24:04.283
- Yes.

663
00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:06.514
- No. I-I-I-I do not
have dinner plans.

664
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:08.512
- I know a great Italian spot.

665
00:24:08.548 --> 00:24:11.821
- Um. um.

666
00:24:11.856 --> 00:24:13.522
- Is that a. is that?
- (gasps) No. that is a yes.

667
00:24:13.558 --> 00:24:15.186
Yes. I would love
that very much.

668
00:24:15.222 --> 00:24:18.196
Pick me up at seven. I
live at Tucker dormitory.

669
00:24:18.231 --> 00:24:20.029
- Sure. I'll pick you up then.

670
00:24:20.064 --> 00:24:20.897
- Okay.

671
00:24:20.933 --> 00:24:21.765
Bye.

672
00:24:23.333 --> 00:24:24.836
(gentle music)

673
00:24:24.872 --> 00:24:25.703
I see you!

674
00:24:29.406 --> 00:24:32.140
(laughs) Oh. Parker.

675
00:24:32.175 --> 00:24:33.504
Really?

676
00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.441
Thank you.

677
00:24:34.476 --> 00:24:35.342
Thank you. Parker.

678
00:24:35.378 --> 00:24:36.543
(phone beeps)

679
00:24:36.579 --> 00:24:38.750
Oh. no way. Travis Maddox.

680
00:24:38.785 --> 00:24:42.415
You can keep knocking but I
am not gonna answer that door.

681
00:24:42.451 --> 00:24:45.420
No way. (laughs)

682
00:24:45.456 --> 00:24:46.625
I'll see you soon. Parker.

683
00:24:48.458 --> 00:24:49.324
- Thanks again. Sonny.

684
00:24:49.359 --> 00:24:50.057
- Anytime. doctor.

685
00:24:51.427 --> 00:24:52.792
- Doctor Hayes.

686
00:24:52.828 --> 00:24:54.727
- He's jumping
the gun. you know.

687
00:24:54.762 --> 00:24:56.562
I just started. that's all.

688
00:24:56.598 --> 00:24:59.002
- Wow. fancy-fancy.

689
00:24:59.037 --> 00:24:59.836
- Yeah.

690
00:25:01.941 --> 00:25:02.773
Wow.

691
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.743
- Are you on call?

692
00:25:05.778 --> 00:25:08.677
- No. I-I just got a heads-up
about a show tonight.

693
00:25:08.713 --> 00:25:10.646
- Oh. oh. I can get
my own ride home.

694
00:25:10.681 --> 00:25:12.649
- No. no. no. we-we
should both go.

695
00:25:12.685 --> 00:25:15.249
Unless you've got work
or sick of seeing me.

696
00:25:15.284 --> 00:25:16.319
- No.

697
00:25:16.354 --> 00:25:17.651
No. I would love to go.

698
00:25:17.686 --> 00:25:19.592
- This is-this is gonna be fun.

699
00:25:20.456 --> 00:25:21.858
(Abby chuckles)

700
00:25:21.893 --> 00:25:23.926
- You know. I've always wanted
to see Titus Andronicus.

701
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:27.330
It's considered to be
Shakespeare's most violent play.

702
00:25:27.366 --> 00:25:28.632
- You don't mind violence?

703
00:25:28.668 --> 00:25:30.768
- No. I was something
of a tomboy growing up.

704
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.667
- Well. then you're
in for a treat.

705
00:25:33.702 --> 00:25:34.970
- Ooh. I guess it's starting.

706
00:25:36.675 --> 00:25:37.836
- (speaks indistinctly)
he's a state champ.

707
00:25:37.871 --> 00:25:39.544
He's gonna come out swinging.

708
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.838
He's not gonna be
wasting any sort of time.

709
00:25:40.874 --> 00:25:42.241
Okay. what are you doing?

710
00:25:43.747 --> 00:25:45.280
- Abby hasn't texted
me back today.

711
00:25:45.316 --> 00:25:46.218
- Oh. my God.

712
00:25:46.253 --> 00:25:47.649
Would you forget about Abby?

713
00:25:47.685 --> 00:25:49.050
Have you. have
you seen this guy?

714
00:25:49.085 --> 00:25:52.955
He's got a white robe and
a belt that's huge. okay?

715
00:25:52.991 --> 00:25:54.620
I mean. you're acting like
the kissing booth over here.

716
00:25:54.655 --> 00:25:56.324
You need to focus.

717
00:25:56.359 --> 00:25:57.490
(hand slaps)

718
00:25:57.526 --> 00:25:58.997
- I am focused.

719
00:25:59.033 --> 00:26:01.895
(hands slapping)

720
00:26:01.931 --> 00:26:03.836
- (scoffs) That's
the Travis we need.

721
00:26:03.871 --> 00:26:05.263
Come on.

722
00:26:05.299 --> 00:26:07.701
- I just don't know why
she hasn't texted me back.

723
00:26:07.736 --> 00:26:08.803
I'm gonna go outside and see

724
00:26:08.838 --> 00:26:10.140
if I can get better
cell reception.

725
00:26:10.176 --> 00:26:10.943
(upbeat music)

726
00:26:10.979 --> 00:26:12.640
- We're dead.

727
00:26:12.675 --> 00:26:15.314
(crowd cheering and clapping)

728
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:17.049
- Oh. wow. modern
interpretation.

729
00:26:17.085 --> 00:26:18.013
I love Shakespeare.

730
00:26:19.415 --> 00:26:20.351
(foot thuds)

731
00:26:20.386 --> 00:26:23.386
(crowd cheering and clapping)

732
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:24.355
- All right. all right.

733
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.921
Next up. we have the main event:

734
00:26:26.956 --> 00:26:29.992
Freddy Heflin versus
Travis "Mad Dog" Maddox!

735
00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:34.694
- This is gonna be great.

736
00:26:34.729 --> 00:26:37.032
Travis is a real animal.

737
00:26:40.602 --> 00:26:42.068
Are you okay?

738
00:26:42.104 --> 00:26:44.969
- Yeah. yeah. it's just
a little hot in here.

739
00:26:45.004 --> 00:26:47.474
I'm gonna go find a bathroom.

740
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.576
(door clicks)

741
00:26:48.611 --> 00:26:49.748
- What the fuck. Abby?

742
00:26:51.013 --> 00:26:52.682
You don't respond
to any of my texts.

743
00:26:52.718 --> 00:26:54.814
and now you're here
dressed like that

744
00:26:54.849 --> 00:26:55.749
with your titties hanging out.

745
00:26:55.784 --> 00:26:57.214
- They are not hanging out.

746
00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.419
This is a tasteful
amount of cleavage.

747
00:26:59.454 --> 00:27:00.391
- Yeah?

748
00:27:00.426 --> 00:27:01.292
Well. they're distracting me.

749
00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:02.461
- Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot.

750
00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:04.657
It's all about
you. you egomaniac.

751
00:27:04.693 --> 00:27:06.160
- I must break you.

752
00:27:07.232 --> 00:27:08.063
- Go for it.

753
00:27:09.699 --> 00:27:11.233
- That's who you're fighting?

754
00:27:11.268 --> 00:27:11.962
- Yes.

755
00:27:11.998 --> 00:27:13.564
- That guy could kill you.

756
00:27:13.599 --> 00:27:16.570
- Is this your weird little
way of admitting you like me?

757
00:27:16.606 --> 00:27:17.803
- I don't like you.

758
00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:18.870
But I do worry about you.

759
00:27:18.906 --> 00:27:20.071
I worry about the planet.

760
00:27:20.107 --> 00:27:22.009
They're two very
different things.

761
00:27:22.044 --> 00:27:24.514
- Okay. well. if it
puts your mind at ease.

762
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:25.710
he's not even gonna hit me.

763
00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:26.746
- Hilarious.

764
00:27:26.781 --> 00:27:27.579
- Are you doubting me?

765
00:27:27.614 --> 00:27:28.446
- Yeah.

766
00:27:29.554 --> 00:27:30.585
- Care to make it interesting?

767
00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.090
- Make it interesting?

768
00:27:32.125 --> 00:27:33.025
Like a bet?

769
00:27:33.061 --> 00:27:33.586
- [Travis] Yeah.

770
00:27:33.622 --> 00:27:34.719
- I don't bet.

771
00:27:34.755 --> 00:27:35.922
(door clicks)

772
00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:36.756
- Come on. Travis.
they need you.

773
00:27:36.791 --> 00:27:38.459
- Yeah. just a minute.

774
00:27:38.494 --> 00:27:39.860
How's this?

775
00:27:39.896 --> 00:27:42.026
If he manages to
lay a hand on me.

776
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:44.365
I'll go without sex for a week.

777
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.663
- Ooh.

778
00:27:45.699 --> 00:27:46.706
- A month.

779
00:27:47.603 --> 00:27:48.436
Three months.

780
00:27:48.472 --> 00:27:49.938
- Three months?

781
00:27:49.973 --> 00:27:52.141
That's impossible
for someone like you.

782
00:27:52.176 --> 00:27:56.477
- Okay. and if I win. you have
to stay with me for a month.

783
00:27:56.512 --> 00:27:57.613
- You're on.

784
00:27:57.648 --> 00:27:59.015
But get it through your head.

785
00:28:00.651 --> 00:28:02.315
I am never having sex with you.

786
00:28:05.186 --> 00:28:06.852
- I don't wanna have
sex with you. pidge.

787
00:28:06.887 --> 00:28:08.893
I wanna be around you.

788
00:28:09.758 --> 00:28:10.730
You're good for me.

789
00:28:13.101 --> 00:28:16.098
(crowd cheering)

790
00:28:17.171 --> 00:28:18.532
You are handsome.

791
00:28:18.568 --> 00:28:19.335
- You're dead.

792
00:28:19.371 --> 00:28:20.765
(Freddy grunts)

793
00:28:20.801 --> 00:28:23.501
(crowd cheering)

794
00:28:25.078 --> 00:28:25.772
- Hah.

795
00:28:25.808 --> 00:28:27.940
You are handsome as hell.

796
00:28:27.975 --> 00:28:29.243
No wonder you're the champ.

797
00:28:30.349 --> 00:28:31.278
Champ of my heart.

798
00:28:32.781 --> 00:28:33.779
(punches whooshing)

799
00:28:33.815 --> 00:28:35.015
- Come on. hit him!

800
00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.448
- You ever hiked
Brokeback Mountain?

801
00:28:37.752 --> 00:28:38.885
Do you wanna?

802
00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.419
- I'll be gentle. you know.

803
00:28:42.124 --> 00:28:43.895
- How are you gonna
kill me. big boy?

804
00:28:45.794 --> 00:28:46.658
(punches whooshing)

805
00:28:46.694 --> 00:28:47.525
Giddy up.

806
00:28:55.268 --> 00:28:57.109
- [Woman]
(indistinctly) kill you!

807
00:28:57.145 --> 00:28:58.243
(crowd cheering)

808
00:28:58.278 --> 00:29:00.906
(Freddy growling)

809
00:29:00.941 --> 00:29:02.179
- What are you doing?

810
00:29:02.215 --> 00:29:03.109
- Shut up.

811
00:29:03.144 --> 00:29:04.346
(Freddy grunting)
(fists whooshing)

812
00:29:04.382 --> 00:29:05.683
- Hit him!

813
00:29:05.718 --> 00:29:07.251
(Freddy grunting)
(fists whooshing)

814
00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:08.251
(cage clanks)

815
00:29:08.287 --> 00:29:09.217
Just once!

816
00:29:10.184 --> 00:29:11.552
(Freddy grunting)
(fists whooshing)

817
00:29:11.587 --> 00:29:13.787
(body thuds)

818
00:29:13.822 --> 00:29:15.758
- Oh-oh. baby fell down.

819
00:29:15.794 --> 00:29:17.555
Get back in your
crib. little baby.

820
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.094
(Freddy growls)

821
00:29:21.129 --> 00:29:22.728
(Freddy grunting)
(fists whooshing)

822
00:29:22.764 --> 00:29:23.629
(cage clanks)

823
00:29:23.665 --> 00:29:24.496
Oh-ho-ho.

824
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:27.101
Now. (indistinctly).

825
00:29:27.137 --> 00:29:29.540
So I'm saving the upper
left sock throw for you.

826
00:29:29.575 --> 00:29:31.008
- [Freddy] Fuck you. bitch.

827
00:29:32.412 --> 00:29:34.006
- You cover those up.

828
00:29:34.041 --> 00:29:35.642
- [Freddy] You bitch. (growls)

829
00:29:35.677 --> 00:29:36.978
- Excuse me.

830
00:29:37.013 --> 00:29:38.946
(Freddy grunting)
(fists whooshing)

831
00:29:38.982 --> 00:29:43.916
(Travis grunting)
(fists thudding)

832
00:29:43.951 --> 00:29:45.952
- Just once. hit him!

833
00:29:45.988 --> 00:29:49.689
(Freddy grunts)
(fists thuds)

834
00:29:49.725 --> 00:29:50.525
- Here we go!

835
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.362
(kick thuds)

836
00:29:52.398 --> 00:29:55.098
(fists thudding)

837
00:29:58.602 --> 00:30:01.236
(gentle music)

838
00:30:05.741 --> 00:30:08.141
(crowd cheering)

839
00:30:08.176 --> 00:30:11.943
- Ladies and gentlemen.
Travis Maddox!

840
00:30:11.978 --> 00:30:14.980
(Travis grunting)

841
00:30:15.016 --> 00:30:16.752
- Pack your bags. pigeon.

842
00:30:16.787 --> 00:30:19.151
You're coming home with me.

843
00:30:19.187 --> 00:30:22.427
(Travis imitating
monkey whooping)

844
00:30:22.462 --> 00:30:23.258
- How did this happen?

845
00:30:24.357 --> 00:30:28.560
(Travis imitating
monkey whooping)

846
00:30:29.998 --> 00:30:32.403
- Hey. I got you a water.

847
00:30:32.438 --> 00:30:34.899
(Travis grunting)

848
00:30:34.935 --> 00:30:36.271
What's going on?

849
00:30:37.311 --> 00:30:39.612
(gentle music)

850
00:30:39.647 --> 00:30:41.707
(sighs) I just need
to process this.

851
00:30:41.743 --> 00:30:43.075
- I know.

852
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.075
- We go out for a great dinner.

853
00:30:45.111 --> 00:30:46.847
Get on really well.

854
00:30:46.882 --> 00:30:48.415
I take you to a show.

855
00:30:49.248 --> 00:30:51.423
I leave you for five minutes.

856
00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:52.956
And during that time.

857
00:30:52.992 --> 00:30:56.690
you've decided to move
in with Travis Maddox.

858
00:30:56.726 --> 00:30:58.196
- I lost a bet.

859
00:30:58.231 --> 00:30:59.057
- Right.

860
00:30:59.092 --> 00:31:00.059
- We're just friends.

861
00:31:00.094 --> 00:31:01.431
I mean. we're not even friends.

862
00:31:01.467 --> 00:31:02.768
We're nothing.

863
00:31:02.803 --> 00:31:04.899
I had a really nice
time with you tonight

864
00:31:04.934 --> 00:31:06.301
and I would love to do it again.

865
00:31:07.935 --> 00:31:09.875
(Parker chuckles)

866
00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:12.307
Do you think I can. I can
get a good-night kiss?

867
00:31:15.976 --> 00:31:16.878
(Travis screams)

868
00:31:16.913 --> 00:31:18.347
(Abby screams)
- Oh. God!

869
00:31:18.383 --> 00:31:19.349
No!

870
00:31:19.385 --> 00:31:20.318
- Travis!

871
00:31:20.354 --> 00:31:21.413
- Time to go.

872
00:31:21.449 --> 00:31:22.951
- Yeah. you need to. you
need to leave the car.

873
00:31:22.987 --> 00:31:26.388
- He is not going
to do anything.

874
00:31:26.424 --> 00:31:27.993
See?

875
00:31:28.028 --> 00:31:28.955
- No. he's gonna hurt me.
- He's not gonna hurt you.

876
00:31:28.991 --> 00:31:29.789
- No. he's gonna hurt me.

877
00:31:29.825 --> 00:31:30.894
- Open the door.

878
00:31:30.929 --> 00:31:31.660
- Get out of the car.
- [Abby] No.

879
00:31:31.695 --> 00:31:32.563
(knuckles rapping)

880
00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:33.499
- Please get out the car!

881
00:31:33.534 --> 00:31:34.466
- You are strong. it's okay.

882
00:31:34.501 --> 00:31:36.434
- No. he is a maniac.

883
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:37.836
He is gonna hurt me.

884
00:31:37.871 --> 00:31:38.935
leave the car!
- He's not going to hurt.

885
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.703
- Leave the car now!
- Oh. my God.

886
00:31:40.739 --> 00:31:43.104
- Get out the fucking car!

887
00:31:43.139 --> 00:31:44.741
- Open the door!
- You're being insane.

888
00:31:44.776 --> 00:31:45.976
Okay. okay.
- Leave the car.

889
00:31:46.011 --> 00:31:48.445
Go. go. leave the car!
- Okay. I'm leaving.

890
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.446
Okay. okay.

891
00:31:49.482 --> 00:31:50.380
- Go. please.

892
00:31:50.415 --> 00:31:51.547
Go now.

893
00:31:51.583 --> 00:31:52.316
- [Travis] Okay.

894
00:31:52.351 --> 00:31:53.812
- Okay.

895
00:31:53.847 --> 00:31:55.147
Okay.

896
00:31:55.182 --> 00:31:56.821
(Travis screams)
- Oh. Jesus.

897
00:31:56.856 --> 00:31:59.691
Yeah. on it. yeah.
(Travis giggling)

898
00:31:59.727 --> 00:32:00.991
(Travis imitating
monkey whooping)

899
00:32:01.027 --> 00:32:02.494
- [Abby] I cannot believe
this is happening.

900
00:32:02.529 --> 00:32:03.828
- Well. for the record.

901
00:32:03.864 --> 00:32:04.794
I didn't think you'd
really settle up.

902
00:32:04.829 --> 00:32:05.862
- Well. I made a bet. I lost.

903
00:32:05.898 --> 00:32:08.133
You're only as
good as your word.

904
00:32:08.168 --> 00:32:10.032
I made it through one night
without any funny business.

905

00:37:16.535 --> 00:37:18.510
- Oh. that's not for me.

1084
00:37:18.545 --> 00:37:19.743
Drinks?

1085
00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:21.377
- [Boys] Yeah.

1086
00:37:21.412 --> 00:37:23.544
- Beer for me and
there's chips up there

1087
00:37:23.579 --> 00:37:25.213
and there's dip and
there's like you know.

1088
00:37:25.248 --> 00:37:26.376
just whatever you can carry.

1089
00:37:26.412 --> 00:37:27.646
- [Abby] Okay.

1090
00:37:27.682 --> 00:37:28.620
- Deal. deal. deal.
deal. deal. deal.

1091
00:37:28.655 --> 00:37:29.580
- Let's go.

1092
00:37:29.615 --> 00:37:30.822
- [Thomas] Let me get the chip.

1093
00:37:30.857 --> 00:37:31.950
- [Trenton] Got nothing.

1094
00:37:33.088 --> 00:37:33.919
- Eat shit.

1095
00:37:35.758 --> 00:37:38.763
Straight on the river and
he does it again. boys.

1096
00:37:38.798 --> 00:37:39.490
(boys chattering)

1097
00:37:39.525 --> 00:37:40.791
- Are you kidding me?

1098
00:37:40.827 --> 00:37:42.326
- Abby. you've been
watching a while.

1099
00:37:42.362 --> 00:37:43.360
You wanna join?

1100
00:37:43.396 --> 00:37:44.361
- Oh. I'm okay.

1101
00:37:44.397 --> 00:37:45.698
- Don't worry.

1102
00:37:45.733 --> 00:37:47.639
We take it easy on
the ladies over here.

1103
00:37:47.675 --> 00:37:48.501
(Abby chuckles)

1104
00:37:48.537 --> 00:37:49.701
- We can play Go
Fish if you like.

1105
00:37:49.736 --> 00:37:51.242
- You know. I
actually don't think

1106
00:37:51.278 --> 00:37:52.374
it's a question of you
guys going easy on me.

1107
00:37:52.409 --> 00:37:53.537
I actually think
it's a question of me

1108
00:37:53.572 --> 00:37:55.339
going easy on you guys.

1109
00:37:55.374 --> 00:37:56.414
- [Boys] Oh.

1110
00:37:57.412 --> 00:37:59.376
- Okay. you're being serious.

1111
00:37:59.412 --> 00:38:00.179
- [Abby] Mm-hm.

1112
00:38:00.215 --> 00:38:00.948
- [Jeff] Okay.

1113
00:38:00.983 --> 00:38:01.815
- Okay.

1114
00:38:02.848 --> 00:38:04.450
- Abby. you might
not wanna do that.

1115
00:38:04.485 --> 00:38:06.051
Taylor may look like an idiot.

1116
00:38:06.086 --> 00:38:08.286
but he happens to be one of
the best poker players in town.

1117
00:38:08.322 --> 00:38:10.420
- Oh. in town.

1118
00:38:10.456 --> 00:38:11.594
- In the county.

1119
00:38:12.866 --> 00:38:14.098
- Oh. wow. the county.

1120
00:38:14.134 --> 00:38:15.634
- [Tyler] He's
even played on TV.

1121
00:38:15.669 --> 00:38:17.796
- Oh. on TV.

1122
00:38:17.831 --> 00:38:19.767
That's pretty
impressive. I don't know.

1123
00:38:21.302 --> 00:38:24.002
(cards flipping)

1124
00:38:25.712 --> 00:38:26.710
Let's go.

1125
00:38:26.745 --> 00:38:27.511
- Okay.

1126
00:38:28.716 --> 00:38:31.350
(intense music)

1127
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.616
Fold. beginner's luck.

1128
00:38:38.651 --> 00:38:40.620
- This is no beginner's luck.

1129
00:38:40.656 --> 00:38:42.559
- Well. I never said
I was a beginner.

1130
00:38:44.092 --> 00:38:44.891
Call.

1131
00:38:45.764 --> 00:38:49.393
- Flash.

1132
00:38:49.429 --> 00:38:50.768
- Pair of aces.

1133
00:38:50.804 --> 00:38:52.131
- [Twins] Yes!

1134
00:38:52.166 --> 00:38:53.435
- Yes!

1135
00:38:53.471 --> 00:38:55.269
- [Twins] Da. da.
da. da. da. da. da.

1136
00:38:55.304 --> 00:38:56.972
- Aces and eights. boys.

1137
00:38:57.008 --> 00:38:58.568
- Don't tell me!

1138
00:38:58.604 --> 00:39:00.437
That's a full house.

1139
00:39:00.473 --> 00:39:01.740
- Yes. it is.

1140
00:39:01.775 --> 00:39:03.613
- You just got
hustled. bro. (laughs)

1141
00:39:03.648 --> 00:39:06.684
- Well. no. it's only
hustling if I keep your money.

1142
00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:07.478
- Oh.

1143
00:39:07.513 --> 00:39:08.745
- Oh. no. no. no.

1144
00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.957
Sweetheart. that money's yours.

1145
00:39:11.992 --> 00:39:13.757
You won it fair and square.

1146
00:39:13.792 --> 00:39:14.619
- Shit.

1147
00:39:14.654 --> 00:39:17.190
- Where did you learn to play?

1148
00:39:17.226 --> 00:39:18.597
- [Abby] Home.

1149
00:39:18.632 --> 00:39:19.728
- Home?

1150
00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:21.763
Where was that?

1151
00:39:22.702 --> 00:39:23.765
- Vegas.

1152
00:39:24.596 --> 00:39:25.800
My dad taught me.

1153
00:39:27.035 --> 00:39:30.035
- Used to be a high-stakes
poker player named Abernathy.

1154
00:39:31.774 --> 00:39:34.339
I remember hearing stories
about him in Vegas.

1155
00:39:34.375 --> 00:39:35.277
- What happened?

1156
00:39:35.312 --> 00:39:37.674
- Uh. he had this daughter.

1157
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.011
Went with him everywhere.

1158
00:39:40.286 --> 00:39:41.548
I think the mom
walked out on him

1159
00:39:41.584 --> 00:39:43.015
so he was raising
her on his own.

1160
00:39:44.391 --> 00:39:45.754
- [Mick] Your eyes even
when you're shuffling.

1161
00:39:45.789 --> 00:39:46.750
- [Jeff] While she was way
too young to play legally

1162
00:39:46.786 --> 00:39:50.721
but man. she was
a poker prodigy.

1163
00:39:50.756 --> 00:39:52.827
As she got better. he got worse.

1164
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:57.269
So she was left bailing
him out even as a kid.

1165
00:39:57.304 --> 00:39:58.998
- [Mick] Look your
opponent in the eyes.

1166
00:40:00.533 --> 00:40:02.106
- I remember this.

1167
00:40:02.141 --> 00:40:03.940
They called her Lucky Charms.

1168
00:40:03.975 --> 00:40:05.442
- Lucky 13.

1169
00:40:05.477 --> 00:40:07.771
Abby. you must have
heard of her. right?

1170
00:40:07.806 --> 00:40:09.712
She must be about your age.

1171
00:40:12.145 --> 00:40:17.151
After all. this is you
in the article. isn't it?

1172
00:40:17.187 --> 00:40:19.821
(intense music)

1173
00:40:24.029 --> 00:40:25.057
- You're Lucky 13?

1174
00:40:26.597 --> 00:40:28.559
- [Tyler] We just got
hustled by Lucky 13?

1175
00:40:28.594 --> 00:40:29.626
- No fucking way.

1176
00:40:29.661 --> 00:40:31.229
- Guys. I'm sorry.

1177
00:40:31.264 --> 00:40:33.435
I wasn't trying to hustle you
guys or anything. I swear.

1178
00:40:33.471 --> 00:40:36.136
I'm.
- Lucky 13's in this house?

1179
00:40:36.171 --> 00:40:37.273
- Yeah.

1180
00:40:37.308 --> 00:40:39.604
- [Twins] Lucky 13 in the house!

1181
00:40:39.639 --> 00:40:40.905
- Lucky 13 in the house.

1182
00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.113
- Abby. can I get
a photo with you?

1183
00:40:42.148 --> 00:40:43.178
- No. guys. it wasn't really.

1184
00:40:43.213 --> 00:40:44.480
- Guys. guys. hey.

1185
00:40:44.516 --> 00:40:45.512
You're acting like
a bunch of fangirls.

1186
00:40:45.547 --> 00:40:46.313
- [Tyler] Get out of my way.

1187
00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:47.082
- You're a fangirl.

1188
00:40:47.118 --> 00:40:47.711
- She beat me.

You're a fangirl. move!

00:43:11.693 --> 00:43:13.129
That was between Mer and I.

1259
00:43:13.165 --> 00:43:14.129
(finger snaps)

1260
00:43:14.164 --> 00:43:15.159
- Ow!

1261
00:43:15.194 --> 00:43:16.033
- [Abby] That was a
private conversation.

1262
00:43:16.068 --> 00:43:17.196
- That hurt.

1263
00:43:17.231 --> 00:43:18.628
- Well. it serves you right
for eavesdrop (snorts).

1264
00:43:18.664 --> 00:43:20.504
- Whoa-ho.

1265
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.602
What did I just get
out of you there?

1266
00:43:21.637 --> 00:43:22.503
What are you. half bulldog?

1267
00:43:22.538 --> 00:43:23.838
- Well. you groped me.

1268
00:43:23.873 --> 00:43:26.010
- I did not grope
you. that was a poach.

1269
00:43:26.046 --> 00:43:26.605
(Abby snorts)

1270
00:43:26.641 --> 00:43:28.007
Oh. you are a snort.

1271
00:43:28.043 --> 00:43:29.640
I didn't realize this.
- Mm. I'm not ticklish.

1272
00:43:29.676 --> 00:43:30.743
- Okay. don't.

1273
00:43:30.778 --> 00:43:31.982
Do you really wanna play this?

1274
00:43:32.017 --> 00:43:32.543
Okay.

1275
00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:33.713
- Come on.

1276
00:43:33.749 --> 00:43:34.881
- There we go.
- This is just.

1277
00:43:34.917 --> 00:43:35.646
- How do you think
this was gonna end?

1278
00:43:35.682 --> 00:43:36.814
- Get off me.

1279
00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:38.222
I'll fight you. you know.

1280
00:43:38.257 --> 00:43:39.022
I'll fight you.
- Fight?

1281
00:43:39.057 --> 00:43:39.824
Oh. you.

1282
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:40.651
Ow!

1283
00:43:40.687 --> 00:43:41.520
You bit my cat.

1284
00:43:41.555 --> 00:43:42.554
- Oh. relax.

1285
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.557
It was a nibble.

1286
00:43:43.592 --> 00:43:44.523
- Yeah. well it hurt.

1287
00:43:44.559 --> 00:43:45.557
- Oh. did it?

1288
00:43:45.593 --> 00:43:46.624
You loved it.

1289
00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.563
(both panting)

1290
00:43:48.598 --> 00:43:49.965
- I did kind of love it. yeah.

1291
00:43:53.139 --> 00:43:55.938
(both moaning)

1292
00:43:59.673 --> 00:44:02.208
(Abby moaning)

1293
00:44:08.647 --> 00:44:09.482
- Wait!

1294
00:44:09.518 --> 00:44:11.022
(Travis grunts)

1295
00:44:11.058 --> 00:44:13.857
(Abby panting)

1296
00:44:16.227 --> 00:44:16.992
You good?

1297
00:44:20.398 --> 00:44:21.966
- (sighs) Am I good?

1298
00:44:22.001 --> 00:44:22.833
- Mm-hm.

1299
00:44:23.796 --> 00:44:25.000
- (sighs) No.

1300
00:44:28.538 --> 00:44:31.539
Um. I'm just confused.

1301
00:44:31.574 --> 00:44:32.770
- Where are you going?

1302
00:44:32.805 --> 00:44:33.739
- This is a joke.

1303
00:44:33.774 --> 00:44:34.708
- Oh. come on. Travis.

1304
00:44:34.743 --> 00:44:35.807
Don't you wanna talk about this?

1305
00:44:35.842 --> 00:44:37.177
- Talk about it. why?

1306
00:44:37.212 --> 00:44:38.744
You want to hear how I
really feel about you. Abby?

1307
00:44:38.779 --> 00:44:39.776
- [Abby] No. I-I don't.

1308
00:44:39.812 --> 00:44:40.914
- Abby. then.

1309
00:44:40.949 --> 00:44:42.581
- Because I don't
feel the same way.

1310
00:44:42.617 --> 00:44:44.021
- You're lying.

1311
00:44:44.057 --> 00:44:45.284
- I'm not.

1312
00:44:45.319 --> 00:44:49.024
Travis. you're vulgar. you're
a brute. you're (sighs).

1313
00:44:53.426 --> 00:44:56.760
♪ Can you say my name.
say my name. say my name ♪

1314
00:44:56.796 --> 00:44:59.232
(Abby moaning)

1315
00:45:05.342 --> 00:45:06.008
- Touch me.

1316
00:45:08.313 --> 00:45:10.081
(Abby moaning)

1317
00:45:10.117 --> 00:45:12.916
(both moaning)

1318
00:45:17.157 --> 00:45:17.987
I have to pee.

1319
00:45:19.125 --> 00:45:20.022
I'm sorry.

1320
00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:22.853
(door thuds)

1321
00:45:22.888 --> 00:45:24.360
(knuckles rapping)

1322
00:45:24.395 --> 00:45:26.024
(Shepley moaning)

1323
00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.264
- [Shepley] Wait.
where you going?

1324
00:45:27.299 --> 00:45:28.464
I'm on the verge.

1325
00:45:28.499 --> 00:45:29.399
- I'll be right back.

1326
00:45:29.435 --> 00:45:30.101
- [Shepley] Babe. I'm on.

1327
00:45:30.137 --> 00:45:31.202
(door clicks)

1328
00:45:31.237 --> 00:45:32.135
- What's going on?

1329
00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:33.599
- Shh.

1330
00:45:33.634 --> 00:45:34.602
- You okay?

1331
00:45:34.637 --> 00:45:36.038
- No. no. I'm not okay.

1332
00:45:36.073 --> 00:45:40.044
Um. Travis and I. we made
out kind of aggressively.

1333
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:40.974
- Clarify.

1334
00:45:41.009 --> 00:45:43.842
- And then I grabbed.
he grabbed my.

1335
00:45:43.877 --> 00:45:45.850
I put his hand on my.

1336
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:47.679
- Breast?

1337
00:45:47.714 --> 00:45:49.086
- No. lower.

1338
00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:49.949
- Oh.

1339
00:45:49.985 --> 00:45:51.249
- America. I don't
know what to do.

1340
00:45:51.284 --> 00:45:53.654
It's like. the logic
goes out of my head.

1341
00:45:53.689 --> 00:45:54.922
If I go back in there.

1342
00:45:54.957 --> 00:45:56.493
I'm not gonna be
able to stop myself.

1343
00:45:56.528 --> 00:45:58.060
- (chuckles) So you do like him.

1344
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.833
- America. I think
I'm in love with him.

1345
00:46:02.564 --> 00:46:03.362
- Hey. Abby.

1346
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.602
This is a totally
normal position

1347
00:46:06.637 --> 00:46:08.601
and I'm not flexing at all.

1348
00:46:08.637 --> 00:46:09.808
Hey. baby girl.

1349
00:46:11.508 --> 00:46:13.375
Are you okay?

1350
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:14.574
Are you okay?

1351
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:16.009
Are you okay?

1352
00:46:16.044 --> 00:46:17.244
She's okay. she's
okay. she's okay.

1353
00:46:18.582 --> 00:46:20.047
She's just nervous.

1354
00:46:20.083 --> 00:46:21.385
but I can help you
through your nervousness.

1355
00:46:21.421 --> 00:46:22.648
Don't read her like this.

1356
00:46:22.684 --> 00:46:24.655
It's too corny.

1357
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.787
You're not toxic.
you're a cool guy.

1358
00:46:26.822 --> 00:46:28.653
You're really cool and strong.

1359
00:46:28.689 --> 00:46:30.326
Hi. Abby.

1360
00:46:30.362 --> 00:46:31.725
Give me a hug.

1361
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.931
Oh. no. that's so scary.

1362
00:46:35.301 --> 00:46:38.100
(intense music)

1363
00:46:47.072 --> 00:46:49.279
(footsteps tapping)

1364
00:46:49.315 --> 00:46:50.808
(door creaks)

1365
00:46:50.843 --> 00:46:52.348
(door thuds)

1366
00:46:52.384 --> 00:46:55.018
(door clicks)

1367
00:46:56.223 --> 00:46:57.020
- [Abby] Travis?

1368
00:47:09.567 --> 00:47:12.563
(phone message beeps)

1369
00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:18.407
(vehicle engines revving)
(crowd chattering)

1370
00:47:19.243 --> 00:47:20.904
- Yeah. no. I mean. he might
have a (speaks indistinctly).

1371
00:47:20.939 --> 00:47:22.377
(door thuds)

1372
00:47:22.412 --> 00:47:22.939
Guys.

1373
00:47:22.974 --> 00:47:23.910
Oh. hold up.

1374
00:47:23.945 --> 00:47:25.149
Where the hell have you been?

1375
00:47:25.184 --> 00:47:26.309
- Out.

1376
00:47:26.544 --> 00:47:28.282
- Jesus. you reek of alcohol.
(cat meows)

1377
00:47:28.883 --> 00:47:30.350
- (sighs) I got a cat.

1378
00:47:31.524 --> 00:47:33.389
I named him Tabby. he's a stray.

1379
00:47:33.424 --> 00:47:34.991
(cat hisses)

1380
00:47:35.027 --> 00:47:37.124
And I would kill for him.
and he would kill for me

1381
00:47:37.159 --> 00:47:39.260
unlike some people I
know in this house.

1382
00:47:40.525 --> 00:47:43.361
- That's the neighbor's
cat. Rumpleteazer.

1383
00:47:43.396 --> 00:47:45.099
- [Travis] All right.
isn't this Tabby?

1384
00:47:45.135 --> 00:47:47.568
- I mean. brah. it's got
a collar right there.

1385
00:47:47.604 --> 00:47:50.174
(cat meowing)

1386
00:47:50.209 --> 00:47:51.439
- Shit.

1387
00:47:51.474 --> 00:47:52.141
Well.

1388
00:47:53.444 --> 00:47:54.110
- Hey. bud.

1389
00:47:55.748 --> 00:47:57.311
- The hell are you
still doing here?

1390
00:47:59.214 --> 00:48:01.551
- I was up all night
worried about you.

1391
00:48:01.586 --> 00:48:03.351
- (laughs) That's rich.

1392
00:48:03.386 --> 00:48:06.257
Shouldn't you be worried about
your boyfriend or something?

1393
00:48:06.293 --> 00:48:07.588
- My boyfriend?

1394
00:48:07.624 --> 00:48:09.992
- Yeah. Mick.

1395
00:48:10.028 --> 00:48:12.991
That's right. I saw the
text on your computer.

1396
00:48:13.026 --> 00:48:14.291
Very nice. very nice.

1397
00:48:14.327 --> 00:48:16.467
Staying here while
he's texting you

1398
00:48:16.503 --> 00:48:18.601
"I love you. I miss you."

1399
00:48:18.636 --> 00:48:20.097
(scoffs) What a joke.

1400
00:48:20.133 --> 00:48:22.941
- Travis. Mick is my dad.

1401
00:48:24.209 --> 00:48:26.437
And how often are you going
through my text messages?

1402
00:48:26.472 --> 00:48:31.510
- "Can I come see
you?" would make sense.

1403
00:48:31.946 --> 00:48:33.284
So it was your dad?

1404
00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.285
(Travis laughs)

1405
00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.817
No way.

1406
00:48:36.852 --> 00:48:38.154
That's terrible of me.

1407
00:48:38.954 --> 00:48:40.684
Well. I misinterpreted that.

1408
00:48:41.988 --> 00:48:42.686
That's great news.

1409
00:48:43.826 --> 00:48:45.662
- Is it great news?

1410
00:48:45.697 --> 00:48:47.161
Travis. you invaded my privacy

1411
00:48:47.196 --> 00:48:49.926
and then you turned
around and ghosted me.

1412
00:48:49.961 --> 00:48:50.830
Goodbye.

1413
00:48:50.866 --> 00:48:51.800
- Abby. wait. wait.

1414
00:48:51.835 --> 00:48:53.571
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1415
00:48:53.606 --> 00:48:55.904
I-I was jealous. I messed up.

1416
00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:57.734
- No. Travis. you
didn't mess up.

1417
00:48:57.769 --> 00:49:00.806
If anything. you just showed
me who you really are.

1418
00:49:00.842 --> 00:49:02.238
(gentle music)

1419
00:49:02.274 --> 00:49:03.644
- Abby. wait. can we talk?

1420
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:04.645
- [Abby] Bye.

1421
00:49:04.681 --> 00:49:05.811
(door creaks)

1422
00:49:05.847 --> 00:49:06.911
- [Travis] Hey.

1423
00:49:06.946 --> 00:49:08.715
(door thuds)

1424
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:10.989
(soft music)

1425
00:49:12.955 --> 00:49:16.720
(Abby sniffs and mumbling)

1426
00:49:20.598 --> 00:49:23.595
(crowd chattering)

1427
00:49:31.338 --> 00:49:32.808
- [Parker] Did
anyone ever tell you

1428
00:49:32.843 --> 00:49:35.643
that you're a very cute sleeper?

1429
00:49:35.679 --> 00:49:37.545
- Hi. Parker.

1430
00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.142
- Hi.

1431
00:49:39.177 --> 00:49:40.716
Is Travis nearby?

1432
00:49:40.751 --> 00:49:41.648
Do I need to be worried?

1433
00:49:41.684 --> 00:49:43.454
- Ugh. no.

1434
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:44.951
- It's been a while.

1435
00:49:44.986 --> 00:49:46.753
How-how have you been?

1436
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:47.685
- Pretty shitty.

1437
00:49:48.988 --> 00:49:50.193
- Postmates?

1438
00:49:50.827 --> 00:49:52.063
- I would love that.

1439
00:49:54.064 --> 00:49:56.230
- So. I spent most
of fifth grade

1440
00:49:56.266 --> 00:49:59.068
with a broken leg that
they had to reset twice.

1441
00:49:59.103 --> 00:50:01.367
So I got to know the
doctors pretty well.

1442
00:50:01.402 --> 00:50:03.035
and realized that's
what I wanted to do

1443
00:50:03.071 --> 00:50:04.875
with the rest of my life.

1444
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:06.577
- What kind of doctor
do you wanna be?

1445
00:50:06.612 --> 00:50:07.637
- Pediatric medicine.

1446
00:50:07.673 --> 00:50:09.372
- Right. yeah. of
course. because it's you.

1447
00:50:09.408 --> 00:50:11.916
- Anyway. that's
enough about me.

1448
00:50:11.951 --> 00:50:13.711
- What do you wanna
be when you grow up?

1449
00:50:14.579 --> 00:50:16.114
- I'm still trying
to figure it out.

1450
00:50:16.149 --> 00:50:19.183
(phone message beeps)

1451
00:50:19.218 --> 00:50:20.987
(phone keys clacking)

1452
00:50:21.022 --> 00:50:22.119
(phone message beeps)

1453
00:50:22.154 --> 00:50:23.859
Really good ramen.

1454
00:50:23.894 --> 00:50:25.858
- Do you wanna get out of here?

1455
00:50:25.894 --> 00:50:28.699
- Yes. yes. yes.

1456
00:50:28.734 --> 00:50:31.833
I'm saying yes a lot. but yes.

1457
00:50:31.868 --> 00:50:33.137
- It is right up here.

1458
00:50:34.502 --> 00:50:36.874
- [Abby] We're not gonna
a show again. are we?

1459
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:37.903
- I would not make
that mistake again.

1460
00:50:37.939 --> 00:50:39.542
(Abby chuckles)

1461
00:50:39.578 --> 00:50:40.511
(door creaks)

1462
00:50:40.547 --> 00:50:42.043
Right through here.

1463
00:50:42.079 --> 00:50:44.075
- [Abby] Why is it
so dark in here?

1464
00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:46.317
- [All] Surprise!

1465
00:50:46.352 --> 00:50:47.211
- Whoo.

1466
00:50:47.246 --> 00:50:48.144
All right. everybody.

1467
00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.145
Get some drinks.

1468
00:50:49.181 --> 00:50:50.214
Get some shots.

1469
00:50:50.249 --> 00:50:51.554
Happy birthday. Abby.

1470
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:52.387
- Thank you.

1471
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.292
- [Shepley] Hey.
are you surprised?

1472
00:50:54.327 --> 00:50:55.019
- Yeah.

1473
00:50:55.054 --> 00:50:56.825
- Touchdown.

1474
00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.662
And. uh. nice work. doc.

1475
00:50:58.697 --> 00:50:59.995
- Were you in on this?

1476
00:51:00.031 --> 00:51:01.831
- Uh. only for the
last 10 minutes.

1477
00:51:01.866 --> 00:51:03.194
Shepley put out an APB for you.

1478
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:05.436
- Babe. success. success.

1479
00:51:05.472 --> 00:51:06.902
Take some shots.

1480
00:51:06.937 --> 00:51:08.270
Told you this would work out.

1481
00:51:08.306 --> 00:51:09.307
did I not. I said it.
- You did. you really did.

1482
00:51:09.342 --> 00:51:10.834
Yeah.

1483
00:51:10.869 --> 00:51:13.004
- I'm gonna grab us a
drink and I will take this.

1484
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.912
- Oh. thank you.

1485
00:51:14.947 --> 00:51:16.809
- How are you. birthday pal?
- Hi.

1486
00:51:16.845 --> 00:51:17.680
Thank you.

1487
00:51:17.716 --> 00:51:18.911
- Isn't this great?

1488
00:51:18.947 --> 00:51:20.849
- Yeah. yeah.

1489
00:51:20.885 --> 00:51:22.112
Who are all these people?

1490
00:51:22.148 --> 00:51:23.786
- Mm. no idea.

1491
00:51:23.822 --> 00:51:25.088
Travis got it in his head

1492
00:51:25.124 --> 00:51:26.320
that this was the only
way to say he was sorry

1493
00:51:26.355 --> 00:51:28.960
and then Shepley got
like really excited and.

1494
00:51:28.995 --> 00:51:30.590
and I couldn't talk
them off the ledge.

1495
00:51:32.026 --> 00:51:33.128
- There he is.

1496
00:51:33.163 --> 00:51:35.091
I should probably
go talk to Travis.

1497
00:51:35.126 --> 00:51:36.534
- Yeah.

1498
00:51:36.569 --> 00:51:37.234
Bye. little bird.

1499
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:41.131
(keg tapping)

1500
00:51:41.166 --> 00:51:43.204
- You busy?

1501
00:51:43.239 --> 00:51:46.476
- Hey. it's the
almost birthday girl.

1502
00:51:46.512 --> 00:51:47.978
Surprised?

1503
00:51:48.014 --> 00:51:49.680
- Yeah. surprised is
an understatement.

1504
00:51:49.716 --> 00:51:51.682
You even recruited Parker.

1505
00:51:51.717 --> 00:51:53.184
- Well. he found you.

1506
00:51:54.419 --> 00:51:56.814
I should have known that you
guys would be hanging out.

1507
00:51:57.822 --> 00:51:58.849
- Well. I can trust him.

1508
00:52:00.393 --> 00:52:00.917
- Cool.

1509
00:52:02.527 --> 00:52:03.260
- Cool.

1510
00:52:07.161 --> 00:52:08.324
Um. well. I'm gonna.

1511
00:52:08.359 --> 00:52:10.060
- Yeah. have fun.

1512
00:52:10.095 --> 00:52:10.927
- Yeah.

1513
00:52:13.066 --> 00:52:13.798
- You okay?

1514
00:52:14.671 --> 00:52:15.503
- No.

1515
00:52:16.775 --> 00:52:17.835
I need to get fucked up.

1516
00:52:19.405 --> 00:52:21.210
- I can make that happen.

1517
00:52:21.245 --> 00:52:25.383
- [Crowd] Shot. shot.
shot. shot. shot.

1518
00:52:25.418 --> 00:52:26.978
- Whoo!

1519
00:52:27.013 --> 00:52:27.812
- Ooh!

1520
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.548
- Oh. two.

1521
00:52:30.583 --> 00:52:33.149
- Shoot. oh. all right.
- Damn. girl.

1522
00:52:33.184 --> 00:52:34.120
- Whoo!

1523
00:52:34.156 --> 00:52:35.556
- It's that kind of night.

1524
00:52:37.155 --> 00:52:38.088
Oh.

1525
00:52:38.123 --> 00:52:39.530
- Oh.

1526
00:52:39.565 --> 00:52:40.124
- Slow down.

1527
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.061
- I'm so sorry.

1528
00:52:41.097 --> 00:52:41.828
The line was interminable.

1529
00:52:41.863 --> 00:52:43.162
- Oh.

1530
00:52:43.198 --> 00:52:44.900

1531
00:52:44.935 --> 00:52:46.063

- Uh.

1533
00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:49.632
- Why are you so good at this?

1534
00:52:49.668 --> 00:52:51.269
- I'll be over
there on the sofa.

1535
00:52:51.305 --> 00:52:52.301
- You played this before.

1536
00:52:52.337 --> 00:52:53.743
You played this.

1537
00:52:53.779 --> 00:52:56.808
(electro-pop music)

1538
00:53:08.592 --> 00:53:10.721
- If you look at the health
care system under Obamacare.

1539
00:53:10.756 --> 00:53:14.027
we are obviously on
a collision course.

1540
00:53:14.062 --> 00:53:16.064
I know. it's bad.

1541
00:53:16.099 --> 00:53:20.599
(electro-pop music continues)

1542
00:53:20.634 --> 00:53:22.970
Oh. come on.
- No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

1543
00:53:23.005 --> 00:53:24.102

1544
00:53:24.138 --> 00:53:25.234

He's got.

00:53:28.012 --> 00:53:31.645

1547
00:53:36.855 --> 00:53:38.520
- No. I don't want kids!

1548
00:53:38.555 --> 00:53:40.858
- What do you. what do you
mean you don't want kids?

1549
00:53:40.893 --> 00:53:42.518
It's.
- I don't want kids.

1550
00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:43.419
I don't wanna.
- Why?

1551
00:53:43.454 --> 00:53:44.454
I never knew this.

1552
00:53:44.489 --> 00:53:46.489
- I don't want any kids.

1553
00:53:46.524 --> 00:53:47.963
- I want like five kids.

1554
00:53:47.998 --> 00:53:49.194
- Five kids?
- Yes.

1555
00:53:49.229 --> 00:53:50.493
I want Ted Junior.

1556
00:53:50.528 --> 00:53:51.998
- Don't. who is Ted One?

1557
00:53:52.033 --> 00:53:53.334
- Millicent.

1558
00:53:53.369 --> 00:53:55.431
- I'm not a baby factory.
- This is.

1559
00:53:55.467 --> 00:53:56.700
this is like whole.

1560
00:53:56.736 --> 00:53:58.370
- And I'm not naming
my kid Millicent.

1561
00:53:58.405 --> 00:53:59.635
- This is the point of life.

1562
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:02.946
- (screams) I hate Millicent.

1563
00:54:02.981 --> 00:54:04.376
- [Shepley] Well. I hate you.

1564
00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:05.716
- [America] I hate you more.

1565
00:54:05.751 --> 00:54:07.046
(Shepley sobbing)

1566
00:54:07.082 --> 00:54:08.616
- Are you okay?

1567
00:54:09.621 --> 00:54:10.687
- No.

1568
00:54:10.723 --> 00:54:11.982
No. it's over.

1569
00:54:12.985 --> 00:54:15.689
I'm never giving my heart
to anyone ever again.

1570
00:54:15.957 --> 00:54:16.859
- No!

1571
00:54:16.895 --> 00:54:17.993
No. don't say that.

1572
00:54:18.028 --> 00:54:19.658
You just need to dance.

1573
00:54:19.693 --> 00:54:21.391
You just need to dance
your troubles away.

1574
00:54:21.426 --> 00:54:23.059
Just do what I do.

1575
00:54:25.164 --> 00:54:26.969
Oh. hi.

1576
00:54:27.004 --> 00:54:28.534
- Babe. I am so sorry.

1577
00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:30.039
I don't know why I
said that out there.

1578
00:54:30.074 --> 00:54:31.903
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1579
00:54:34.675 --> 00:54:36.109
Do you wanna go

1580
00:54:36.144 --> 00:54:37.474
- Yes. right now?

1581
00:54:37.509 --> 00:54:39.948
Yeah. let's go.
- Okay.

1582
00:54:39.983 --> 00:54:41.616

1583
00:54:44.423 --> 00:54:46.319

00:54:46.354 --> 00:54:49.453
- No. come on. dance with me.

1585
00:54:49.489 --> 00:54:50.586

00:54:50.622 --> 00:54:53.191

00:54:53.226 --> 00:54:54.423
Oh. I know.

1589
00:54:56.703 --> 00:54:57.429

1590
00:54:57.464 --> 00:54:58.264
- The boys like the twerking.

1591
00:54:58.299 --> 00:54:59.500
- No. no. you're not.

1592
00:54:59.535 --> 00:55:00.736
No. this is. uh. yeah.
- This is twerking.

1593
00:55:00.772 --> 00:55:01.531
Twerking.

1594
00:55:01.566 --> 00:55:02.799
- Yeah. yeah. it's good.

1595
00:55:02.834 --> 00:55:04.700
- Come on. have

Come on. loosen up. have fun.

Come on.

1598
00:55:08.441 --> 00:55:09.710
- He's in the back room.

1599
00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:11.714
- Excuse me.

1600
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:12.543
- Travis?

1601
00:55:12.578 --> 00:55:14.578
The guy you're looking for.

1602
00:55:14.613 --> 00:55:16.013
- No. I came here with you.

1603
00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:19.120
- Wow!

1604
00:55:19.156 --> 00:55:20.287
Oh. you actually recoiled.

1605
00:55:20.322 --> 00:55:22.288
- You just caught me off guard.

1606
00:55:22.324 --> 00:55:23.589
- Be honest with yourself

1607
00:55:23.625 --> 00:55:25.830
and see this thing
through with Travis.

1608
00:55:25.865 --> 00:55:27.229
- He's not good for me.

1609
00:55:27.265 --> 00:55:28.828
- You keep telling
yourself that.

1610
00:55:36.006 --> 00:55:37.466
- Hello. hello.

1611
00:55:37.502 --> 00:55:38.541
Okay. thank you.

1612
00:55:40.839 --> 00:55:43.607
- Hey. what the
fuck are you doing?

1613
00:55:43.642 --> 00:55:44.742
You heard of alcohol poisoning?

1614
00:55:44.777 --> 00:55:46.477
You hit double
digits an hour ago.

1615
00:55:46.513 --> 00:55:48.346
- What are you. counting?

1616
00:55:48.381 --> 00:55:49.580
- Yeah. actually.

1617
00:55:49.615 --> 00:55:50.621
You've had enough for tonight.

1618
00:55:50.656 --> 00:55:51.683
- No.

1619
00:55:51.718 --> 00:55:52.987
- Have you got
anything to eat today?

1620
00:55:53.022 --> 00:55:54.385
- Yes. soup.

1621
00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.018
- Soup?
- Soup.

1622
00:55:56.053 --> 00:55:58.421
- Okay. well. that's
gonna end badly for you.

1623
00:55:58.457 --> 00:55:59.663
Stop drinking.

1624
00:55:59.698 --> 00:56:00.823
- No.

1625
00:56:00.859 --> 00:56:02.426
- [Travis] You're
beyond stubborn.

1626
00:56:02.461 --> 00:56:03.862
- Oh. I'm so sorry

1627
00:56:03.898 --> 00:56:06.095
I'm not one of your
subservient little wenches.

1628
00:56:06.131 --> 00:56:07.498
- Do you know how hard
this was to put together?

1629
00:56:07.533 --> 00:56:08.898
I did all this for you.

1630
00:56:08.933 --> 00:56:11.701
- I didn't ask you
to do any of this.

1631
00:56:11.736 --> 00:56:14.573
- I-I know. that's the point.

1632
00:56:14.609 --> 00:56:16.739
I did it because
I care about you.

1633
00:56:16.774 --> 00:56:18.615
- Well. Travis. you're too late.

1634
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:22.013
Tomorrow the bet's over. and
you never have to see me again.

1635
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:25.588
- [Travis] Shit.

1636
00:56:26.418 --> 00:56:27.187
Abby. wait.

1637
00:56:27.222 --> 00:56:27.956
- [Abby] Go away!

1638
00:56:27.992 --> 00:56:29.057
- Stand still.

1639
00:56:29.092 --> 00:56:30.520
I. you're a mess.

1640
00:56:30.556 --> 00:56:31.289
Why are you running?

1641
00:56:31.325 --> 00:56:32.460
- You're a mess.

1642
00:56:32.495 --> 00:56:33.224
- I'm faster than you.
- No. no. no.

1643
00:56:33.259 --> 00:56:34.523
- Abby!

1644
00:56:34.559 --> 00:56:36.064
- Get off. no!

1645
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.365
- Okay. okay. okay.

1646
00:56:37.401 --> 00:56:39.536
- You know. you
are such a coward.

1647
00:56:39.571 --> 00:56:41.234
You're such a coward.
- You're not making any sense.

1648
00:56:41.269 --> 00:56:42.698
- No. you're not.

1649
00:56:42.734 --> 00:56:44.536
You just run away from me.

1650
00:56:44.571 --> 00:56:47.104
Rather than ask me who Mick was.

1651
00:56:47.139 --> 00:56:50.239
You just-you just run away
and then you just throw me

1652
00:56:50.274 --> 00:56:54.548
this really big surprise
birthday party for my birthday.

1653
00:56:54.583 --> 00:56:55.778
And you think it's
all gonna be okay

1654
00:56:55.813 --> 00:56:57.485
where I don't even know anybody.

1655
00:56:57.521 --> 00:56:59.950
And then you just
ignore me all night.

1656
00:56:59.985 --> 00:57:02.758
And you think I'm just
gonna forgive you?

1657
00:57:02.793 --> 00:57:06.891
Because you throw me this really
big surprise birthday party

1658
00:57:06.927 --> 00:57:09.692
for my birthday where
I don't know anybody.

1659
00:57:09.727 --> 00:57:11.464
- You said that already.

1660
00:57:11.499 --> 00:57:12.836
- Stop telling me what to do!

1661
00:57:12.872 --> 00:57:14.500
- Okay. okay.

1662
00:57:14.536 --> 00:57:17.705
First off. I did
apologize to you

1663
00:57:17.741 --> 00:57:19.672
and I tried to have a
conversation with you too.

1664
00:57:19.708 --> 00:57:21.475
But you ran off to
the fucking library

1665
00:57:21.511 --> 00:57:23.512
only to show up
later with Parker

1666
00:57:23.547 --> 00:57:25.713
and then proceed to
get beyond fucked up.

1667
00:57:25.749 --> 00:57:28.582
So. pidge. you're gonna
have to walk away from me

1668
00:57:28.617 --> 00:57:30.114
because I can't
walk away from you.

1669
00:57:38.557 --> 00:57:40.226
(vomits splashes)

1670
00:57:40.262 --> 00:57:42.524
(gentle music)

1671
00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:43.693
Beautiful.

1672
00:57:43.729 --> 00:57:45.096
- When did I have noodles?

1673
00:57:47.566 --> 00:57:50.666
(Abby coughing)

1674
00:57:50.701 --> 00:57:51.641
I think I'm done.

1675
00:57:53.539 --> 00:57:54.910
(both groaning)

1676
00:57:54.945 --> 00:57:55.945
- Okay.

1677
00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.739
- Oh. sorry.

1678
00:57:56.774 --> 00:57:58.379
- Oh. you're all right.

1679
00:57:58.414 --> 00:58:00.476
Well. I sure hope you're done.

1680
00:58:00.511 --> 00:58:02.853
I'm not sure if you
have anything left
in there to throw up.

1681
00:58:02.889 --> 00:58:05.583
(both laughs)

1682
00:58:05.619 --> 00:58:08.119
- Hey. you wanna make out?

1683
00:58:10.028 --> 00:58:11.089
- Not really. no.

1684
00:58:12.094 --> 00:58:13.061
I don't.

1685
00:58:13.097 --> 00:58:14.895
(Abby laughs)

1686
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:17.064
You know what the best
part about this is. pigeon?

1687
00:58:17.099 --> 00:58:18.534
- Hm.

1688
00:58:18.569 --> 00:58:20.166
- You're not gonna
remember any of this.

1689
00:58:20.202 --> 00:58:21.002
- I'm not?

1690
00:58:21.037 --> 00:58:22.573
- No.

1691
00:58:22.608 --> 00:58:26.302
So when I tell you that
I'm madly in love with you.

1692
00:58:27.376 --> 00:58:28.271
- I won't remember.

1693
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.582
- But I really mean it.

1694
00:58:32.411 --> 00:58:33.309
- Hm.

1695
00:58:34.084 --> 00:58:35.684
(Abby gasps)

1696
00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.054
Do you wanna go to
International House of Pancakes

1697
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:39.120
and get pancakes?

1698
00:58:39.156 --> 00:58:40.087
(Travis gasps)

1699
00:58:40.122 --> 00:58:40.891
Yeah?

1700
00:58:40.927 --> 00:58:42.118
You wanna go?

1701
00:58:42.154 --> 00:58:43.526
I love pancakes.
- Oh. man. what a great idea.

1702
00:58:43.561 --> 00:58:44.992
I'm gonna get you up.
- Do you wanna go?

1703
00:58:45.027 --> 00:58:46.030
- I'm gonna stand you up.
- Oh. I wanna go to pancakes.

1704
00:58:46.065 --> 00:58:47.056
Okay. I want pancakes.

1705
00:58:47.091 --> 00:58:48.894
- I got you a clean
shirt instead.

1706
00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:51.195
I'll be back.
- Thank you. that's very nice.

1707
00:58:51.562 --> 00:58:53.137
- Um.

1708
00:58:53.172 --> 00:58:56.073
- I'm a monster. (chuckles)

1709
00:58:56.108 --> 00:58:57.536
- Okay. let me help you.

1710
00:58:57.571 --> 00:58:58.438
- I'm stuck out here.

1711
00:58:58.473 --> 00:58:59.770
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1712
00:58:59.806 --> 00:59:01.538
- Okay. there we
go. put this on.

1713
00:59:01.574 --> 00:59:02.580
- Turn around.

1714
00:59:03.982 --> 00:59:05.410
I'm decent.

1715
00:59:05.446 --> 00:59:06.447
Just kidding.

1716
00:59:06.483 --> 00:59:08.483
(Abby laughs)
- Oh. my God.

1717
00:59:08.519 --> 00:59:09.417
- I got you.
- Put your shirt on.

1718
00:59:09.452 --> 00:59:11.153
- I got you.
- Put it on.

1719
00:59:11.189 --> 00:59:11.954
- I'm putting it on.

1720
00:59:11.989 --> 00:59:12.650
- Okay.

1721
00:59:12.686 --> 00:59:14.353
- Okay. it's on. (laughs)

1722
00:59:14.389 --> 00:59:15.157
- Oh. my God.

1723
00:59:15.192 --> 00:59:16.257
Oh. I can't trust.

1724
00:59:16.292 --> 00:59:18.128
- I got you again.

1725
00:59:18.163 --> 00:59:18.888
- You did. you got me.

1726
00:59:18.923 --> 00:59:20.594
and I really wanna look again.

1727
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:21.826
but you should
put your shirt on.

1728
00:59:21.862 --> 00:59:23.367
- I'm a little
prankster tonight.

1729
00:59:23.402 --> 00:59:25.831
- You are very
silly. I'll say that.

1730
00:59:25.867 --> 00:59:28.768
Okay. you did it.
I'm so proud of you.

1731
00:59:28.803 --> 00:59:30.472
I'm gonna get you
some water. okay?

1732
00:59:30.508 --> 00:59:31.336
I'll be back.
- That's so nice.

1733
00:59:31.372 --> 00:59:32.640
Thank you.

1734
00:59:32.676 --> 00:59:33.772
you're really nice.
- I'm very sweet.

1735
00:59:33.807 --> 00:59:35.506
- Thanks.
- Who's your daddy?

1736
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:38.110
(door thuds)

1737
00:59:40.448 --> 00:59:42.579
(crowd screaming)

1738
00:59:42.615 --> 00:59:45.582
(phone ringing)

1739
00:59:45.617 --> 00:59:46.855
- Hey. baby.

1740
00:59:47.619 --> 00:59:49.289
- Hi. Mick.

1741
00:59:49.325 --> 00:59:50.720
- How are you?

1742
00:59:50.756 --> 00:59:52.793
- It's my birthday.

1743
00:59:52.828 --> 00:59:55.496
I was just wondering
if you were gonna call.

1744
00:59:55.531 --> 00:59:56.959
- I know it's your birthday.

1745
00:59:56.994 --> 00:59:58.896
I. uh. I wanted to come see you

1746
00:59:58.932 --> 01:00:01.034
but I have no idea
where you are.

1747
01:00:02.133 --> 01:00:05.038
- [Abby] I'm in
college in Sacramento.

1748
01:00:06.475 --> 01:00:07.242
- [Mick] How's college?

1749
01:00:07.277 --> 01:00:08.011
How are you doing?

1750
01:00:08.046 --> 01:00:08.877
- I'm good.

1751
01:00:09.641 --> 01:00:10.774
I'm good.

1752
01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:11.877
- I haven't talked to you

1753
01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:14.718
and I-I-I really
miss talking to you.

1754
01:00:15.615 --> 01:00:16.581
- [Travis] Pidge?

1755
01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:17.550
- Oh. I have to go.

1756
01:00:17.585 --> 01:00:21.685
I love you. Dad. bye.

1757
01:00:21.721 --> 01:00:24.860
(car engine revving)

1758
01:00:32.764 --> 01:00:34.465
What time is it?

1759
01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.468
- One.

1760
01:00:35.504 --> 01:00:36.734
- In the afternoon?

1761
01:00:36.769 --> 01:00:38.869
How am I not hung over?

1762
01:00:38.905 --> 01:00:40.973
- Well. I forced
a liter of water

1763
01:00:41.008 --> 01:00:41.871
down your throat along
with two ibuprofens

1764
01:00:41.907 --> 01:00:43.642
before you went to sleep.

1765
01:00:43.677 --> 01:00:45.714
(Abby chuckles)
What?

1766
01:00:45.749 --> 01:00:47.977
- It's just that one
night. you're drunk.

1767
01:00:48.012 --> 01:00:50.017
Then the next night. I'm drunk.

1768
01:00:51.722 --> 01:00:53.757
- Yeah. we're not
really in sync. are we?

1769
01:00:54.886 --> 01:00:56.386
- We're like a disaster.

1770
01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.225
- You know.

1771
01:01:01.666 --> 01:01:02.794
just thinking we can
kick this birthday off

1772
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:04.762
with some breakfast in bed.

1773
01:01:04.797 --> 01:01:06.865
- I would love a coffee.

1774
01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.706
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.

1775
01:01:14.475 --> 01:01:17.044
(sniffs) Oh.

1776
01:01:19.183 --> 01:01:21.312
(Abby sighs)

1777
01:01:25.818 --> 01:01:26.749
(footsteps tapping)

1778
01:01:26.785 --> 01:01:28.621
(door creaks)

1779
01:01:28.656 --> 01:01:29.620
- [Travis] Here you go.

1780
01:01:29.655 --> 01:01:31.056
- Thank you.

1781
01:01:31.092 --> 01:01:33.993
You know I was thinking
since it's my birthday

1782
01:01:34.028 --> 01:01:35.993
and our last night
together as roommates

1783
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:39.330
that maybe we do
something special.

1784
01:01:40.834 --> 01:01:42.098
- What do you have in mind?

1785
01:01:42.134 --> 01:01:44.137
- Let's look in
the magic drawer.

1786
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:49.373
A foot massage.

1787
01:01:51.811 --> 01:01:52.849
- Anything you want.

1788
01:01:53.647 --> 01:01:56.149
(gentle music)

1789
01:02:00.225 --> 01:02:01.123
(Abby groans)

1790
01:02:01.159 --> 01:02:01.985
Too much?

1791
01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.160
- No. it's good. it's good.

1792
01:02:03.195 --> 01:02:04.721
It's really good.

1793
01:02:04.756 --> 01:02:05.689
Do it again.

1794
01:02:05.725 --> 01:02:06.492
(Abby groaning)

1795
01:02:06.527 --> 01:02:07.691
Okay. okay.

1796
01:02:07.727 --> 01:02:08.461
Maybe lighter.

1797
01:02:08.497 --> 01:02:09.830
Maybe lighter.

1798
01:02:09.866 --> 01:02:11.101
lighter. lighter.
- Okay. okay. okay.

1800
01:02:12.567 --> 01:02:14.368
- Yeah. (chuckles)

1801
01:02:14.403 --> 01:02:15.234
That's good.

1802
01:02:17.376 --> 01:02:19.441
My calf's kind of hurting.

1803
01:02:19.476 --> 01:02:20.638

1804
01:02:20.674 --> 01:02:21.878

1806
01:02:25.812 --> 01:02:28.147
Yeah. that feels good.

1807
01:02:28.183 --> 01:02:32.350
- Is there anyone else do
you want me to massage?

1851
01:04:42.015 --> 01:04:43.045
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

Good night. Abby.

1859
01:05:08.545 --> 01:05:10.379
Abby Abernathy.

1860
01:05:10.415 --> 01:05:10.973
Good morning.

01:05:12.582 --> 01:05:13.308
Can I help you?

1863
01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:15.510
- Uh. this might sound weird.

1864
01:05:15.546 --> 01:05:17.647
but I'm gonna need
you to come with me.

1865
01:05:19.022 --> 01:05:21.150
- Yeah. no. that's
not going to happen.

1866
01:05:21.186 --> 01:05:22.586
- What if I asked nicely?

1867
01:05:23.659 --> 01:05:24.588
- Have a nice day.

1868
01:05:25.729 --> 01:05:27.195
- [Vince] It's about your dad.

1869
01:05:31.732 --> 01:05:32.632
- My dad?

1870
01:05:32.668 --> 01:05:33.498
- [Vince] Yeah.

1871
01:05:34.802 --> 01:05:36.104
- What about him?

1872
01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.635
- [Vince] He's placing
bad bets and owes my boss.

1873
01:05:38.671 --> 01:05:41.476
They're gonna break his legs
if you don't come with me.

1874
01:05:41.512 --> 01:05:44.113

1875

1878
01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:26.450
- What?
- Hey.

1879
01:06:26.485 --> 01:06:27.788
- There you guys are.
where have you been?

1880
01:06:27.823 --> 01:06:28.588
- What's going on. man?

1881
01:06:28.624 --> 01:06:29.218
Just geez.

1882
01:06:29.253 --> 01:06:30.861
- Abby's disappeared.

1883
01:06:30.896 --> 01:06:32.828
Now help me look for
a clue or anything.

1884
01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:34.428
- First of all.
don't yell at me.

1885
01:06:34.463 --> 01:06:35.927
Second of all. there's a lot
about Abby that you don't know.

1886
01:06:35.963 --> 01:06:37.227
- I know everything.

1887
01:06:37.262 --> 01:06:38.729
I know that she's Lucky 13.

1888
01:06:38.764 --> 01:06:42.938
and now I know that she packed
her mattress full of money.

1889
01:06:42.973 --> 01:06:44.635
- Hang on. I'm
tracking her location.

1890
01:06:46.743 --> 01:06:48.003
She's headed to Vegas.

1891
01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:48.808
- Vegas?

1892
01:06:48.843 --> 01:06:50.240
- This isn't good.

1893
01:06:50.275 --> 01:06:52.010
Wait. hey. that's my phone!

1894
01:06:52.046 --> 01:06:53.745
- Buy yourself a new one.

1895
01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:54.515

1896
01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:55.685

- Hey.

1904
01:07:06.728 --> 01:07:08.093
Hey. Mick.

1905
01:07:08.128 --> 01:07:10.898
- (clears throat) I'm sorry.

1906
01:07:10.933 --> 01:07:12.635
- How much do you owe Benny?

1907
01:07:12.671 --> 01:07:14.166
- [Mick] A hundred grand.

1908
01:07:14.202 --> 01:07:15.869
- $100.000. Dad?
- I know. I know.

1909
01:07:15.905 --> 01:07:17.104
- Are you kidding me. Dad?

1910
01:07:17.139 --> 01:07:19.142
- I'm doing all
this stuff. I swear.

1911
01:07:19.177 --> 01:07:22.342
I'm-I'm doing Gamblers
Anonymous and Debtors Anonymous.

1912
01:07:22.377 --> 01:07:24.274
I've-I've complete.
- It works if you work it.

1913
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:26.075
Isn't that what they say. Mick?

1914
01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:27.150
Hello. Abby.

1915
01:07:28.487 --> 01:07:29.683
How's your game?

1916
01:07:29.719 --> 01:07:31.151
- I'm retired.

1917
01:07:31.186 --> 01:07:34.817
- Oh. Abigail. anonymous
college student.

1918
01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:39.129
Well. uh. for your
father's sake.

1919
01:07:39.164 --> 01:07:42.792
I hope it's a short time
because he owes me 100 grand

1920
01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.961
by midnight tonight.

1921
01:07:44.997 --> 01:07:46.266
- Come on.

1922
01:07:46.302 --> 01:07:47.670
Your own dad wouldn't
even lend him any money.

1923
01:07:47.706 --> 01:07:49.302
You know he has a problem.

1924
01:07:49.337 --> 01:07:52.306
- Unlike my father.
may he rest in peace.

1925
01:07:52.342 --> 01:07:54.208
I'm not running a daycare.
I'm running a business.

1926
01:07:54.243 --> 01:07:57.275
- Well. 100 grand by
tonight is impossible.

1927
01:07:57.311 --> 01:07:58.407
- We both know.
with your talent.

1928
01:07:58.442 --> 01:07:59.942
you can make that in a day.

1929
01:07:59.977 --> 01:08:03.380
I used to watch you win 30
grand in 30 minutes underground.

1930
01:08:03.416 --> 01:08:05.620
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1931
01:08:05.656 --> 01:08:06.782
- I'm underage.

1932
01:08:06.818 --> 01:08:09.025
- If I get caught. I have
to drop out of college.

1933
01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.388
- You've lived here
long enough. kiddo.

1934
01:08:10.423 --> 01:08:12.294
You know how to
avoid getting caught.

1935
01:08:13.694 --> 01:08:15.691
- There has to be another
way that we can handle this.

1936
01:08:15.727 --> 01:08:17.731
- There it is. but
you're not gonna like it.

1937
01:08:17.767 --> 01:08:18.568
(fingers snaps)

1938
01:08:18.603 --> 01:08:20.203
- [Abby] Hey. hey!

1939
01:08:20.239 --> 01:08:24.104
- No. no. no. no. please no!
- I'll do it. I'll do it!

1940
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:25.837
- Good to see you
again. Abigail.

1941
01:08:25.872 --> 01:08:27.238
Mick.

1942
01:08:27.273 --> 01:08:30.073
Hey. enough with the buffet.

1943
01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:31.681
Get her a room.

1944
01:08:31.717 --> 01:08:33.515
Leave her the fuck alone.

1945
01:08:33.551 --> 01:08:34.211
Let's go.

1946
01:08:34.247 --> 01:08:35.685
Come on. take the top off.

1947
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.412
What are you doing here?

1948
01:08:36.447 --> 01:08:40.289
(motorcycle engine revving)

1949
01:08:44.794 --> 01:08:47.761
(taser crackling)

1950
01:08:47.797 --> 01:08:50.398
(upbeat music)

1951
01:08:53.836 --> 01:08:56.602
(elevator pings)

1952
01:09:08.785 --> 01:09:11.050
- Wow. wow. wow.

1953
01:09:11.086 --> 01:09:12.614
- Did you do what I asked?

1954
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:14.554
- Yeah. just like
you instructed.

1955
01:09:16.323 --> 01:09:17.488
Are you sure you
wanna stay here?

1956
01:09:17.523 --> 01:09:18.960
There are bigger
whales at the Bellagio.

1957
01:09:18.995 --> 01:09:20.259
- They'll recognize me there.

1958
01:09:20.295 --> 01:09:21.897
I'm trying to stay
under the radar.

1959
01:09:21.932 --> 01:09:23.261
- Anything else. Your Majesty?

1960
01:09:23.296 --> 01:09:24.999
- Yeah. give the waitress 200

1961
01:09:25.034 --> 01:09:26.695
to start watering down my drinks

1962
01:09:26.731 --> 01:09:28.802
and go wait outside
until I call you.

1963
01:09:28.838 --> 01:09:29.971
- You got it.

1964
01:09:30.006 --> 01:09:33.674
(motorcycle engine revving)

1965
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:34.910
- Hey.

1966
01:09:34.945 --> 01:09:36.844
Are you guys playing poker?

1967
01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.746
- No. it's roulette.

1968
01:09:38.782 --> 01:09:41.350
(Abby groaning)

1969
01:09:42.813 --> 01:09:44.820
- There's a minimum
buy-in of five grand.

1970
01:09:44.855 --> 01:09:47.857
- Ooh. okay. Lion King.

1971
01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.221
- Look at you. you look nice.

1972
01:09:49.256 --> 01:09:50.819
But this is a high-stakes room.

1973
01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:53.095
Do yourself a favor and
go to the main floor

1974
01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:54.657
and pick out a
shiny slot machine.

1975
01:09:54.692 --> 01:09:56.659
- I can't go back
to the main floor.

1976
01:09:56.695 --> 01:09:58.529
You see. I'm at this
bachelorette party

1977
01:09:58.564 --> 01:10:01.338
and Cheryl invited
this twat. Terry.

1978
01:10:01.373 --> 01:10:04.671
who hates me because Lyle
finger-banged me on Halloween.

1979
01:10:04.706 --> 01:10:07.842
which in my defense I thought
that they were separated.

1980
01:10:07.878 --> 01:10:09.139
Where's my vibrator?

1981
01:10:09.175 --> 01:10:10.140
- [Players] Huh?

1982
01:10:10.176 --> 01:10:12.645
(upbeat music)

1983
01:10:15.282 --> 01:10:17.749
- Psst. is this a good hand?

1984
01:10:20.586 --> 01:10:22.721
What's up with the
silent treatment?

1985
01:10:25.895 --> 01:10:28.628
(chips clattering)

1986
01:10:33.467 --> 01:10:36.673
Hey. Cliff. I like
your tiger shirt.

1987
01:10:36.708 --> 01:10:37.707
Or is it cheetah?

1988
01:10:37.743 --> 01:10:38.873
- Can you be quiet?

1989
01:10:38.908 --> 01:10:39.808
- Can I be quiet?

1990
01:10:39.843 --> 01:10:41.437
Can you be quiet?

1991
01:10:41.472 --> 01:10:42.972
I'm as quiet as a mouse.

1992
01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:45.548
Asshole. say what?

1993
01:10:45.583 --> 01:10:46.549
- What?

1994
01:10:46.585 --> 01:10:48.013
- Exactly.

1995
01:10:48.049 --> 01:10:50.952
(upbeat music)

1996
01:10:50.988 --> 01:10:52.347
I've got two black cards.

1997
01:10:52.383 --> 01:10:53.450
Is that good?

1998
01:10:53.485 --> 01:10:56.285
- You gotta show your hand.

1999
01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.294
- The cards!

2000
01:11:01.592 --> 01:11:02.797
- You gotta be kidding me.

2001
01:11:02.833 --> 01:11:03.927
- Hey. Cliff.

2002
01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:13.442
Rawr.

2003
01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:17.006
(upbeat music)

2004
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:25.151
Okay. well. I'm gonna go
meet up with my peeps.

2005
01:11:25.186 --> 01:11:26.923
It's been real. fellas.

2006
01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:28.952
And like my dad used to say.

2007
01:11:28.987 --> 01:11:32.092
if you can't spot the chump
in the first 30 seconds.

2008
01:11:32.127 --> 01:11:33.088
then you're the chump.

2009
01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:35.794
Bye.

2010
01:11:37.703 --> 01:11:40.029
(phone beeps)

2011
01:11:47.108 --> 01:11:48.270
(crowd chattering)

2012
01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:49.038
- Ma'am?

2013
01:11:51.443 --> 01:11:52.976
You in the blue dress?

2014
01:11:54.047 --> 01:11:54.846
Stop.

2015
01:11:57.986 --> 01:11:58.984
I gotcha.

2016
01:11:59.019 --> 01:12:00.088
- Jesse.

2017
01:12:00.123 --> 01:12:01.483
- I totally got you.
- Hi.

2018
01:12:01.519 --> 01:12:02.792
- [Jesse] Come here.

2019
01:12:02.828 --> 01:12:04.289
- Oh. you scared me.

2020
01:12:04.324 --> 01:12:05.122
- [Jesse] I bet I did.

2021
01:12:05.157 --> 01:12:06.426
- Yeah.

2022
01:12:06.461 --> 01:12:07.422
- [Jesse] Jesus.
you look fantastic.

2023
01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:08.631
- Thank you.

2024
01:12:08.667 --> 01:12:09.192
So do you.

2025
01:12:09.228 --> 01:12:10.031
- Thanks.

2026
01:12:10.066 --> 01:12:11.426
Yeah. security. right?

2027
01:12:11.462 --> 01:12:12.730
- [Abby] Great.

2028
01:12:12.766 --> 01:12:14.002
- Man. I knew I should
have asked you to prom.

2029
01:12:14.037 --> 01:12:15.337
- Right?
- For real.

2030
01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:17.532
- Um. well. I have a. I
have a thing to get to.

2031
01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:18.808
- Oh. yeah. right.

2032
01:12:18.843 --> 01:12:19.975
- Can I call you?

2033
01:12:20.011 --> 01:12:21.174
- Yeah. I would love that.

2034
01:12:21.209 --> 01:12:22.275
I have the same number.

2035
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:23.539
- Yeah. I'll give you a call.

2036
01:12:23.574 --> 01:12:24.779
We'll hang out later.

2037
01:12:24.815 --> 01:12:26.178
- Awesome.

2038
01:12:26.214 --> 01:12:27.309
Just one more thing.

2039
01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:28.746
- Yeah?

2040
01:12:28.781 --> 01:12:31.347
- I'm gonna need you
to give me these chips.

2041
01:12:31.382 --> 01:12:32.480
- Excuse me?

2042
01:12:32.516 --> 01:12:34.383
- Come on. Abby.

2043
01:12:34.419 --> 01:12:35.721
You're underage.

2044
01:12:35.757 --> 01:12:36.759
You know you can't gamble
when you're underage.

2045
01:12:36.795 --> 01:12:37.721
It's illegal.

2046
01:12:37.757 --> 01:12:38.758
I don't wanna see
you get in trouble.

2047
01:12:40.293 --> 01:12:41.061
- Jesse. please.

2048
01:12:41.097 --> 01:12:42.799
I-I need this money.

2049
01:12:42.834 --> 01:12:44.267
- This is my job.

2050
01:12:44.302 --> 01:12:46.903
And I would hate to
see you go to jail.

2051
01:12:46.938 --> 01:12:47.930
Abby. give me the chips.

2052
01:12:47.965 --> 01:12:50.099
I'll totally cover you
with my boss. okay?

2053
01:12:51.269 --> 01:12:52.604
Call me.

2054
01:12:52.639 --> 01:12:57.678
(footsteps tapping)
(intense music)

2055
01:13:03.118 --> 01:13:04.346
(phone ringing)

2056
01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:05.151
- Hey.

2057
01:13:05.187 --> 01:13:05.987
- [Abby] It's Abby.

2058
01:13:06.023 --> 01:13:07.017
Are you at the club?

2059
01:13:08.322 --> 01:13:09.253
- Why. are you okay?

2060
01:13:09.289 --> 01:13:10.658
- I got caught.

2061
01:13:11.663 --> 01:13:12.422
- What?

2062
01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:14.028
- Listen to me. Dad.

2063
01:13:14.064 --> 01:13:14.797
Get out of the club.

2064
01:13:14.833 --> 01:13:15.525
Get out of town.

2065
01:13:15.561 --> 01:13:16.825
Don't use your cell phone.

2066
01:13:16.861 --> 01:13:18.092
Don't use any of
your credit cards

2067
01:13:18.128 --> 01:13:20.100
and text me when you get
a burner phone. okay?

2068
01:13:20.136 --> 01:13:20.965
We'll figure it out.

2069
01:13:22.306 --> 01:13:23.136
- [Mick] I guess
I'll leave tonight.

2070
01:13:23.172 --> 01:13:24.368
I'll hike to Denver.

2071
01:13:24.404 --> 01:13:26.402
- I'm so sorry. Dad.

2072
01:13:26.438 --> 01:13:27.510
I let you down.

2073
01:13:34.017 --> 01:13:35.083
- You called me.

2074
01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:35.885
You said you had my money.

2075
01:13:35.921 --> 01:13:37.178
- I had your money.

2076
01:13:37.214 --> 01:13:39.385
and then it was taken
from me by Jesse Viveros.

2077
01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:40.820
- And that is my problem how?

2078
01:13:41.893 --> 01:13:43.521
Where's Mick?

2079
01:13:43.556 --> 01:13:45.088
- He's gone. but we'll find him.

2080
01:13:47.296 --> 01:13:50.764
(motorcycle engine revving)

2081
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.333
- Just go find Jesse.

2082
01:13:54.368 --> 01:13:55.668
Jesse has your money.

2083
01:13:55.703 --> 01:13:58.774
- I'm not a charity.
and I don't run errands.

2084
01:13:58.809 --> 01:13:59.974
- Shit.

2085
01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:00.774
- You know what?

2086
01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.580
Abby. I like you.

2087
01:14:05.542 --> 01:14:06.681
You're nice.

2088
01:14:07.314 --> 01:14:09.678
So why don't you?

2089
01:14:09.713 --> 01:14:11.150
- What are you doing?

2090
01:14:11.186 --> 01:14:12.484
- Oh. I'm gay.

2091
01:14:12.519 --> 01:14:14.117
Trust me. you're not my type.

2092
01:14:15.492 --> 01:14:18.590
I will sponsor all of
your entrance fees.

2093
01:14:18.626 --> 01:14:20.794
The legal age in
California is 18.

2094
01:14:21.959 --> 01:14:23.894
and we'll split
the profits 50-50.

2095
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:25.662
- Well. I don't wanna
play poker for a living.

2096
01:14:25.697 --> 01:14:27.433
I just wanna go to college.

2097
01:14:27.468 --> 01:14:29.531
- I'm offering you a compromise.

2098
01:14:29.567 --> 01:14:31.038
(door thudding)

2099
01:14:31.074 --> 01:14:31.973
- [Travis] Abby!

2100
01:14:32.008 --> 01:14:33.406
(door slams)

2101
01:14:33.441 --> 01:14:35.278
- What the fuck?
- Travis?

2102
01:14:35.313 --> 01:14:36.610
- [Benny] Security.
- Are you okay?

2103
01:14:36.645 --> 01:14:38.442
- Hey. you got to
leave right now. okay?

2104
01:14:38.477 --> 01:14:41.279
(punches thudding)

2105
01:14:41.314 --> 01:14:43.385
(body thuds)

2106
01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.350
(Dane speaking in
foreign language)

2107
01:14:45.385 --> 01:14:46.382
(clothes ripping)

2108
01:14:46.417 --> 01:14:47.351
- What?

2109
01:14:47.387 --> 01:14:50.156
(lively music)

2110
01:14:50.192 --> 01:14:52.826
(both grunting)

2111
01:14:54.295 --> 01:14:55.626
(monitor clatters)

2112
01:14:55.662 --> 01:15:00.702
(both grunting)
(fists thudding)

2113
01:15:02.566 --> 01:15:03.573
- Travis?

2114
01:15:08.507 --> 01:15:10.708
- That's your one.

2115
01:15:10.744 --> 01:15:11.540
(Dane speaks in
foreign language)

2116
01:15:11.576 --> 01:15:14.650
(both grunting)

2117
01:15:20.056 --> 01:15:21.517
(head thuds)

2118
01:15:21.552 --> 01:15:24.025
(fist thuds)

2119
01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.357
(body thuds)

2120
01:15:26.393 --> 01:15:27.828
- You're good.

2121
01:15:30.632 --> 01:15:32.230
- Taxi.
- [Passerby] Call me. bro.

2122
01:15:32.266 --> 01:15:33.462
- Pigeon?

2123
01:15:33.497 --> 01:15:34.769
Pigeon?

2124
01:15:35.436 --> 01:15:36.466
Where are you going?

2125
01:15:36.502 --> 01:15:37.907
What the heck?

2126
01:15:37.943 --> 01:15:39.173
(elevator pings)

2127
01:15:39.209 --> 01:15:40.106
- Don't talk to me.

2128
01:15:40.141 --> 01:15:40.702
- Why?

2129
01:15:40.738 --> 01:15:42.341
Where are we going?

2130
01:15:42.377 --> 01:15:43.572
Will you talk to me?

2131
01:15:43.607 --> 01:15:45.144
Abby. stop!

2132
01:15:45.179 --> 01:15:46.411
- What?

2133
01:15:46.446 --> 01:15:47.916
What do you want?

2134
01:15:47.951 --> 01:15:49.113
- I. uh.

2135
01:15:50.455 --> 01:15:52.915
- Do you have any idea
what you just did?

2136
01:15:52.951 --> 01:15:54.555
- I wasn't gonna
let them hurt you.

2137
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:56.621
- They weren't hurting
me. I was fine.

2138
01:15:56.656 --> 01:15:58.260
I was handling it on my own.

2139
01:15:58.295 --> 01:15:59.593
- How am I supposed to know

2140
01:15:59.628 --> 01:16:01.729
when you keep
everything a secret?

2141
01:16:01.765 --> 01:16:05.368
I had to track you down
to a strip club in Vegas.

2142
01:16:05.403 --> 01:16:06.532
One day you're
dressed like a nun.

2143
01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:07.400
and then you're wearing this.

2144
01:16:07.435 --> 01:16:08.233
Who the hell are you?

2145
01:16:08.268 --> 01:16:09.468
- God.

2146
01:16:09.503 --> 01:16:10.871
- [Travis] I love you.

2147
01:16:12.604 --> 01:16:14.439
- You love me?

2148
01:16:14.474 --> 01:16:15.209
You don't know me.

2149
01:16:15.244 --> 01:16:16.778
- That's not true.

2150
01:16:16.813 --> 01:16:20.678
Whatever you're going
through. we can figure it out.

2151
01:16:20.713 --> 01:16:22.311
- I don't wanna figure it out.

2152
01:16:23.113 --> 01:16:24.748
I've had enough
crazy in my life.

2153
01:16:24.783 --> 01:16:26.684
I don't want any more crazy.

2154
01:16:26.719 --> 01:16:29.153
And Travis. you make me crazy!

2155
01:16:33.865 --> 01:16:34.928
Shit!

2156
01:16:37.265 --> 01:16:38.066
(body thud)

2157
01:16:38.102 --> 01:16:40.530
(upbeat music)

2158
01:16:40.566 --> 01:16:43.332
(both moaning)

2159
01:16:49.707 --> 01:16:51.708
(mirror shatters)

2160
01:16:51.743 --> 01:16:52.509
Get it out. get it out.

2161
01:16:52.545 --> 01:16:53.642
- I'm trying.

2162
01:16:53.678 --> 01:16:55.314
(tracker rips)

2163
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:56.985
- (groans) Shit.

2164
01:16:57.021 --> 01:16:58.185
Come here.

2165
01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.551
(Abby moans)

2166
01:17:00.586 --> 01:17:03.957
(glass shattering)

2167
01:17:04.922 --> 01:17:05.687
I'm so horny. I'm so horny.

2168
01:17:05.722 --> 01:17:06.658
- I'll try!

2169
01:17:06.693 --> 01:17:08.360
Okay. I'm trying. I'm trying!

2170
01:17:08.396 --> 01:17:09.163
(Travis thuds)

2171
01:17:09.198 --> 01:17:10.798
- Oh. shit.

2172
01:17:10.834 --> 01:17:12.628
- [Man] Hey. what the fuck
is going on over there?

2173
01:17:12.664 --> 01:17:13.764
- Get these off.

2174
01:17:13.799 --> 01:17:14.999
What's wrong with your button?

2175
01:17:15.034 --> 01:17:16.764
- Hey. keep it down.
we're trying to sleep.

2176
01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.568
(Abby groans)

2177
01:17:17.603 --> 01:17:18.571
- Oh. oh. my gosh.

2178
01:17:18.606 --> 01:17:19.405
I'm so sorry. you all right?

2179
01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.840
I-I-I just needed

2180
01:17:20.875 --> 01:17:21.705
to take off my shoe.
- It's okay. come here.

2181
01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.476
(cabinet thud)
Aw.

2182
01:17:23.512 --> 01:17:24.574
- [Man] Hey. knock it off!

2183
01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:25.576
(lamp shatters)

2184
01:17:25.611 --> 01:17:26.812
- [Travis] Jesus.

2185
01:17:26.847 --> 01:17:27.511
- [Woman] What's
going on over there?

2186
01:17:27.547 --> 01:17:28.780
(phone ringing)

2187
01:17:28.816 --> 01:17:33.252
(cabinet clanking
and clattering)

2188
01:17:33.287 --> 01:17:33.982
- No.

2189
01:17:34.017 --> 01:17:34.883
(mirror thuds and shatters)

2190
01:17:34.919 --> 01:17:35.817
(phone ringing continues)

2191
01:17:35.852 --> 01:17:37.320
Go back.
- Yeah.

2192
01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:41.459
(water splashing)

2193
01:17:41.494 --> 01:17:42.430
(Abby gasps)

2194
01:17:42.465 --> 01:17:44.199
(sink crashing)
(cat meows)

2195
01:17:44.234 --> 01:17:45.429
- Oh. no. in here.

2196
01:17:45.464 --> 01:17:47.102
- Yeah.

2197
01:17:47.138 --> 01:17:49.599
(door banging)

2198
01:17:49.635 --> 01:17:50.666
- Take this off.

2199
01:17:50.702 --> 01:17:51.941
Help me get it.

2200
01:17:51.976 --> 01:17:52.571
- Yeah.

2201
01:17:52.606 --> 01:17:53.637
(shower knob squeaks)

2202
01:17:53.672 --> 01:17:55.803
(water splashing)

2203
01:17:55.839 --> 01:17:56.804
(Abby giggles)

2204
01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.914
(siren wailing)

2205
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:06.382
- No.

2206
01:18:07.521 --> 01:18:08.456
(water splashing)

2207
01:18:08.491 --> 01:18:11.060
(cat meows)
(Abby groaning)

2208
01:18:11.096 --> 01:18:13.763
(clothes rip)

2209
01:18:14.595 --> 01:18:15.527
- Do you mind?
- Okay.

2210
01:18:15.562 --> 01:18:16.529
- Yeah. put it in.

2211
01:18:16.564 --> 01:18:17.732
- I don't think it's in.

2212
01:18:17.767 --> 01:18:18.430
- I-I don't think it's
in. I don't think.

2213
01:18:18.466 --> 01:18:19.067
- It's not in.

2214
01:18:19.102 --> 01:18:20.102
- Ow!

2215
01:18:20.137 --> 01:18:20.895
- Oh. sorry.

2216
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:22.099
- Ow. okay. okay.

2217
01:18:22.134 --> 01:18:25.500
Yeah. no. hold on.
let's switch. switch.

2218
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:30.043
- Ow!

2219
01:18:30.908 --> 01:18:33.046
- I can't feel anything.

2220
01:18:34.514 --> 01:18:35.317
- No. no.

2221
01:18:35.352 --> 01:18:36.084
- Let's get out of here.

2222
01:18:36.119 --> 01:18:37.050
- Okay.

2223
01:18:38.915 --> 01:18:40.222
(curtains rattles)

2224
01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:43.056
(phone vibrating)

2225
01:18:50.228 --> 01:18:53.399
- [Benny] Abby. Mick
still owes me 100 grand

2226
01:18:53.435 --> 01:18:55.070
and it's on you.

2227
01:18:55.105 --> 01:18:56.171
Call me.

2228
01:18:56.207 --> 01:18:58.841
(intense music)

2229
01:19:19.857 --> 01:19:21.690
(phone ringing)

2230
01:19:21.725 --> 01:19:22.694
Abby.

2231
01:19:22.730 --> 01:19:25.030
- No. it's her boyfriend.

2232
01:19:25.065 --> 01:19:27.131
Look. I-I know that
she owes you money.

2233
01:19:27.167 --> 01:19:29.437
but I think I have a way
to get it back to you.

2234
01:19:29.472 --> 01:19:30.565
- [Benny] I'm listening.

2235
01:19:32.069 --> 01:19:34.903
♪ Oh. oh. oh. oh. oh. oh ♪

2236
01:19:34.939 --> 01:19:37.508
(Abby groans softly)

2237
01:19:37.544 --> 01:19:38.309
- Travis?

2238
01:19:51.494 --> 01:19:55.023
(phone message beeps)

2239
01:19:55.058 --> 01:19:58.131
(phone keys clacking)

2240
01:20:02.766 --> 01:20:03.598
What?

2241
01:20:07.906 --> 01:20:09.945
- Pigeon. don't be mad.

2242
01:20:11.042 --> 01:20:12.541
I worked out a deal with Benny.

2243
01:20:12.576 --> 01:20:16.013
I'm gonna fight for him
tonight and settle your debt.

2244
01:20:16.049 --> 01:20:18.215
You and your dad
are off the hook.

2245
01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:19.717
I left a rental car
in the parking garage

2246
01:20:19.753 --> 01:20:21.050
for you to get home.

2247
01:20:21.085 --> 01:20:22.619
I'll be back before you know it.

2248
01:20:22.654 --> 01:20:24.952
- Shit.

2249
01:20:24.988 --> 01:20:26.190
(phone rings)

2250
01:20:26.225 --> 01:20:27.460
- [Travis] It's Travis.
you know what to do.

2251
01:20:27.496 --> 01:20:28.222
(phone beeps)

2252
01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:30.163
- Hey. it's me. call me back.

2253
01:20:30.198 --> 01:20:32.462
You have no idea what
you've gotten yourself into.

2254
01:20:36.067 --> 01:20:38.065
- I see you found my new car.

2255
01:20:38.101 --> 01:20:39.308
Pretty sick. right?

2256
01:20:39.343 --> 01:20:40.305
- Yeah. it's nice.

2257
01:20:42.339 --> 01:20:44.246
Tons of room in
there. I like that.

2258
01:20:44.281 --> 01:20:45.612
- Yeah. man.

2259
01:20:45.648 --> 01:20:46.812
- [Mick] So it went okay?

2260
01:20:46.847 --> 01:20:48.210
- Oh. she told me about it.

2261
01:20:48.246 --> 01:20:50.183
Handed over the
chips. no problem.

2262
01:20:51.316 --> 01:20:54.086
So what do you think
she's gonna do now?

2263
01:20:54.121 --> 01:20:56.321
She gonna start working
for Benny or what?

2264
01:20:57.558 --> 01:20:59.258
- Ah. yeah.

2265
01:20:59.293 --> 01:21:01.626
I don't think she has much
of a choice at this point.

2266
01:21:01.662 --> 01:21:03.261
(Jesse chuckles)

2267
01:21:03.296 --> 01:21:05.660
One of the greatest things
that I ever heard is

2268
01:21:05.695 --> 01:21:09.438
if you don't spot the chump
in the first 30 seconds.

2269
01:21:09.473 --> 01:21:10.368
then you are the chump.

2270
01:21:11.707 --> 01:21:12.938
I. uh. I wanna come see you

2271
01:21:12.974 --> 01:21:15.543
but I have no idea
where you are.

2272
01:21:15.578 --> 01:21:16.638
- [Abby] I'm in college.

2273
01:21:17.944 --> 01:21:19.377
- [Vince] It's about your dad.

2274
01:21:21.084 --> 01:21:25.117
- Mick still owes me 100
grand by midnight tonight.

2275
01:21:25.152 --> 01:21:27.185
- I'm gonna need you
to give me these chips.

2276
01:21:27.221 --> 01:21:29.424
- Get out of the club.
get out of town. okay?

2277
01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:30.752
We'll figure it out.

2278
01:21:30.787 --> 01:21:34.095
- [Mick] I guess I'll leave
tonight. I'll hike to Denver.

2279
01:21:35.228 --> 01:21:38.099
- You know. Abby. she's
looking pretty hot.

2280
01:21:38.134 --> 01:21:39.093
- [Mick] Can you not talk
about my daughter. thanks.

2281
01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:40.161
- No. no. I know.

2282
01:21:40.196 --> 01:21:41.636
I was just like. "Dang."

2283
01:21:41.672 --> 01:21:42.898
(Jesse grunts)
(taser crackles)

2284
01:21:42.933 --> 01:21:44.236
(body thuds)

2285
01:21:44.272 --> 01:21:45.474
- Ho. Abby. what are you.
- You son of a bitch.

2286
01:21:45.509 --> 01:21:46.101
- What are you doing?

2287
01:21:46.136 --> 01:21:47.441
- How's Denver. Mick?

2288
01:21:47.477 --> 01:21:48.473
- What the hell?

2289
01:21:48.509 --> 01:21:49.277
Aw.

2290
01:21:49.312 --> 01:21:50.040
Shit.

2291
01:21:50.075 --> 01:21:50.875
Obviously. I'm not in Denver.

2292
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:51.711
That's not what I meant.

2293
01:21:51.746 --> 01:21:54.145
I'm going to Den. ow!

2294
01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:56.046
- You have two
seconds to come clean.

2295
01:21:56.081 --> 01:21:57.214
- To come clean about wha-ow!

2296
01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:00.248
- You. Benny. Jesse.
you guys set me up

2297
01:22:00.283 --> 01:22:02.018
from the beginning. didn't you?

2298
01:22:02.053 --> 01:22:03.287
- [Mick] Abby. Abby. I.

2299
01:22:03.322 --> 01:22:04.452
- You don't owe Benny
any fucking money.

2300
01:22:04.488 --> 01:22:05.926
- Look at me. I'm
an old fucking man.

2301
01:22:05.962 --> 01:22:08.160
I can't play as good
as you play. okay?

2302
01:22:08.195 --> 01:22:10.194
And I need money. I
need money to live.

2303
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:12.834
- Then get a job
like a normal person.

2304
01:22:12.869 --> 01:22:14.632
- I know this doesn't
look good. okay?

2305
01:22:14.668 --> 01:22:15.871
I get it.

2306
01:22:15.906 --> 01:22:18.538
This does not look good.
- Yeah. right. yeah.

2307
01:22:18.574 --> 01:22:19.571
- I love you.

2308
01:22:19.607 --> 01:22:20.376
- Get out.

2309
01:22:20.411 --> 01:22:22.343
Get out!
- Okay.

2310
01:22:22.379 --> 01:22:22.938
- Get out!

2311
01:22:22.974 --> 01:22:23.773
Out of my life.

2312
01:22:23.808 --> 01:22:24.776
Get out!

2313
01:22:24.812 --> 01:22:25.744
- Can I get my bag?

2314
01:22:25.779 --> 01:22:26.876
- [Abby] Get out!

2315
01:22:26.912 --> 01:22:27.711
(tires screech)

2316
01:22:27.746 --> 01:22:28.578
- Abby!

2317
01:22:30.751 --> 01:22:33.850
(upbeat music)

2318
01:22:33.886 --> 01:22:35.419
(crowd cheering)

2319
01:22:35.454 --> 01:22:40.293
(punches and kicks thudding)
(fighter groaning)

2320
01:22:41.025 --> 01:22:42.227
(phone ringing)

2321
01:22:42.262 --> 01:22:42.991
- [Travis] It's Travis.

2324
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.931
You don't have to fight.

2325
01:22:45.966 --> 01:22:47.399
No one owes Benny anything.

2326
01:22:49.973 --> 01:22:52.674

- Man. when you said
come out to Vegas.

2332
01:23:08.452 --> 01:23:10.026
I thought you
meant the Bellagio.

2333
01:23:10.061 --> 01:23:10.721

your mother. all right?

Mad Dog.

2339
01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:22.604

2340
01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.269
in five. four. three. two.

2341
01:23:25.305 --> 01:23:26.872

I can (indistinct)?

2342
01:23:26.907 --> 01:23:27.841

2348
01:23:47.763 --> 01:23:49.527

2353
01:24:04.009 --> 01:24:05.076

(Chernobyl growls)

2361
01:24:16.253 --> 01:24:17.019
- This is gonna suck.

2362
01:24:17.054 --> 01:24:17.857
- Yeah. wow.

2363
01:24:17.892 --> 01:24:20.187
- Let the battle begin.

2364
01:24:20.223 --> 01:24:22.764
(intense music)

2365
01:24:22.799 --> 01:24:25.063
(kicks and punches thudding)

2366
01:24:25.098 --> 01:24:26.193
- [Shepley] Yeah. there you go.

2367
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:27.361
There you go.

2368
01:24:27.397 --> 01:24:29.204

(Travis groaning)
(crowd cheering)

2377
01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:50.184
- Here. I'll pay for him.

2378
01:24:50.219 --> 01:24:52.186
(man smooch)

2379
01:24:52.221 --> 01:24:53.222
(kick thuds)

2380

(Chernobyl grunts)

2385
01:25:03.237 --> 01:25:05.867
- [Chernobyl] No
bitch. Chernobyl.

2386
01:25:06.908 --> 01:25:07.674
- You can't use a chain.

2387
01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:08.837
What is this?

2388
01:25:10.548 --> 01:25:11.105
(Travis grunts)

2389
01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.239
- Ref!

2390
01:25:12.275 --> 01:25:13.241
Stop the fight.

2391
01:25:13.276 --> 01:25:16.552
(punches thudding)

2392
01:25:16.587 --> 01:25:17.816
This is bullshit.

2393
01:25:17.852 --> 01:25:19.246
(chains clank)

2394
01:25:19.282 --> 01:25:22.755
(intense music)

2395
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:24.452

- [Abby] Can I get
through. please?

2400
01:25:32.503 --> 01:25:33.433
- No. whoa!

2401
01:25:36.333 --> 01:25:37.506
- [Shepley] Oh. shit.

2402
01:25:37.542 --> 01:25:39.868
(Travis grunts)

2403
01:25:41.611 --> 01:25:43.108
(kick thuds)

2404
01:25:43.143 --> 01:25:48.184
That's my boy. man. (groans)

2405
01:25:49.981 --> 01:25:51.212
- Shit.

2406
01:25:51.248 --> 01:25:52.050
(bottle cracks)

2407
01:25:52.085 --> 01:25:54.889

01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:14.576
(Chernobyl growling)

01:26:14.612 --> 01:26:16.578
(chair thuds)

2413
01:26:16.614 --> 01:26:19.347
(crowd shouting)

2414
01:26:20.277 --> 01:26:21.683
- Shit. fire!

2415
01:26:21.718 --> 01:26:22.980
(flames crackling)

2416
01:26:23.016 --> 01:26:23.945
- Fire. fire!

2417
01:26:25.084 --> 01:26:26.048
(flames whooshing)

2418
01:26:26.084 --> 01:26:26.882
- Oh. God!

2419
01:26:29.119 --> 01:26:29.918
- Hey.

2420
01:26:31.825 --> 01:26:32.593
- Abby?

2421
01:26:32.628 --> 01:26:33.460
- Hi.

2422
01:26:36.162 --> 01:26:37.257
- Shepley. come on.

2423
01:26:37.293 --> 01:26:38.500
- Come on.

2424
01:26:38.536 --> 01:26:39.293
- Come on.

2425

(Shepley groans)

2426
01:26:45.504 --> 01:26:47.473
- I talked to Shepley
and he's fine.

2427
01:26:47.508 --> 01:26:50.338
I'll be on the first
flight to Vegas tomorrow.

2428
01:26:50.374 --> 01:26:51.809
Hey. just a thought.

2429
01:26:51.844 --> 01:26:54.112
but maybe you wanna check
into the Mirage or the Luxor.

2430
01:26:54.148 --> 01:26:55.177
I-I hear they have deals.

2431
01:26:55.212 --> 01:26:56.148
- It's fine.

2432
01:26:56.183 --> 01:26:57.517
Benny's not gonna do anything.

2433
01:26:57.552 --> 01:26:59.882
His scam didn't work out
and no one owes him a dime.

2434
01:27:00.616 --> 01:27:02.820
Mer. you just have to trust me.

2435
01:27:02.856 --> 01:27:03.853
Bye.

2436
01:27:07.859 --> 01:27:10.324
- I don't know if I ever
wanna leave this bed. pigeon.

2437
01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:11.726
- Hey. Travis?

2438
01:27:11.761 --> 01:27:13.694
- Hm?
- Why do you call me pigeon?

2439
01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:15.998
- You don't know
what a pigeon is?

2440
01:27:16.034 --> 01:27:19.002
- Yeah. it's an annoying bird
that craps on people's heads.

2441
01:27:19.037 --> 01:27:20.240
- No.

2442
01:27:20.275 --> 01:27:23.537
It's a dove. an
attractive girl. a.

2443
01:27:23.573 --> 01:27:25.712
- A winning hand in poker.

2444
01:27:25.747 --> 01:27:26.781
- See?

2445
01:27:26.816 --> 01:27:27.481
You're my pigeon.

2446
01:27:29.084 --> 01:27:30.519
- I'm an exhausted pigeon.

2447
01:27:30.554 --> 01:27:31.520
- I bet.

2448
01:27:31.555 --> 01:27:32.618
- You?

2449
01:27:33.586 --> 01:27:35.249
- I'm gonna stay up
for a little while.

2450
01:27:35.284 --> 01:27:36.855
- Oh.

2451
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:39.894
Are you scared I'm
gonna disappear again
if you go to sleep?

2452
01:27:39.929 --> 01:27:40.989
- It crossed my mind.

2453
01:27:43.261 --> 01:27:43.992
- I love you.

2454
01:27:45.562 --> 01:27:49.305
I love you. Travis Maddox.

2455
01:27:51.775 --> 01:27:52.741
- You love me?

2456
01:27:52.777 --> 01:27:54.002
- It's the tattoos.

2457
01:27:55.505 --> 01:27:56.271
- They're pretty cool.

2458
01:27:56.307 --> 01:27:58.842
(Abby giggles)

2459
01:28:04.019 --> 01:28:05.615
Sure you wanna do this?

2460
01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:08.750
- (scoffs) Dude. I
was born to ride.

2461
01:28:08.786 --> 01:28:10.651
- You got some brain
damage back there.

2462
01:28:10.686 --> 01:28:12.655
- (scoffs) I love you. Mommy.

2463
01:28:12.690 --> 01:28:14.530
Hey. I'll see you
back at the ranch.

2464
01:28:14.565 --> 01:28:15.696
- What?

2465
01:28:15.731 --> 01:28:16.997
- Corn.

2466
01:28:17.032 --> 01:28:18.661
(motorbike engine revs)

2467
01:28:18.696 --> 01:28:20.736
Ah. let's see what
this puppy can do.

2468
01:28:20.771 --> 01:28:22.563
(cans clattering)

2469
01:28:22.598 --> 01:28:23.530
- Is he gonna be okay?

2470
01:28:23.566 --> 01:28:24.639
- [Shepley] Yee-ha!

2471
01:28:24.674 --> 01:28:25.801
- No.

2472
01:28:25.836 --> 01:28:28.170
- [Shepley] I need to
get me one of these.

2473
01:28:28.205 --> 01:28:29.142
Whoo!

2474
01:28:29.177 --> 01:28:29.776
- [Travis] Whose bag is this?

2475
01:28:29.812 --> 01:28:31.179
- Jesse's.

2476
01:28:31.214 --> 01:28:32.576
- Who's Jesse?
- I love this thing.

2477
01:28:32.611 --> 01:28:34.080
- Doesn't matter.
(objects clanking)

2478
01:28:34.116 --> 01:28:35.750
- Does Jesse have a shirt?

2479
01:28:35.785 --> 01:28:36.781
- He might.

2480
01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:41.722
- He does have a shirt.

2481
01:28:41.757 --> 01:28:42.650
- Hey.

2482
01:28:42.685 --> 01:28:44.419
- It's not my favorite style.

2483
01:28:44.454 --> 01:28:45.823
A little loud but.

2484
01:28:54.534 --> 01:28:56.064
He also has a ton
of money in here.

2485
01:28:57.535 --> 01:29:00.368
- Actually. no. that's my money.

2486
01:29:00.404 --> 01:29:02.105
- You won this?

2487
01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:03.242
- Yeah.

2488
01:29:03.277 --> 01:29:04.705
Told you I'm good.
- Yeah.

2489
01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:07.880
So then. this is yours too?

2490
01:29:07.915 --> 01:29:08.884
- Mm-hm.

2491
01:29:08.919 --> 01:29:09.784
- You have great taste.

2492
01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:10.785
(Abby laughs)

2493
01:29:10.821 --> 01:29:11.651
Here's to you.

2494
01:29:14.724 --> 01:29:15.482
Ow.

2495
01:29:15.518 --> 01:29:16.722
- Here's to us.

2496
01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:20.726
- How's my face?

2497
01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:24.763
- Ooh.

2498
01:29:26.332 --> 01:29:28.200
You look better already.

2499
01:29:28.235 --> 01:29:29.537
Vegas for another night?

2500
01:29:30.502 --> 01:29:31.707
- That would be a disaster.

2501
01:29:31.742 --> 01:29:32.837
