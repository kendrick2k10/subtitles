My dad used to
read me bedtime stories

but I...

79
00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.185
I never knew what it meant.

80
00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.645
It's a Spanish folk saying.

81
00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:11.232
It roughly translates to
"That's the end of the story."

82
00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:14.861

lived happily ever after."

and. yeah.

181
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:21.441
I don't want to leave
Principal Lee in the lurch.

182
00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:24.319
Mom. what about
your travel plans?

183
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.446
Well. what fun
would it be on my own?

184
00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:29.407
I'd rather wait till you
had a moment to come along.

185
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.576
and just like Dad planned to do.

186
00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.579
Did talk ever talk about
going back to Mexico again?

How do you mean?

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.668
Well. I mean.
he grew up there.

189
00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.295
but isn't it kind of weird that
he never instilled. you know.

191
00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:48.301
Becoming an American citizen
meant the world

to your father.

193
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.847
He fully embraced his life here.

194
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.684
and assimilating for him meant

195
00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.937
leaving certain parts behind.

196
00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.772

it's been three years.

-Ugh?
Why are you so glum?

-Apartment hunting
in this market is bleak!

204

So little space
for so much money.

205
00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:24.713
-Ooh. forced coziness!

206
00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.340
Oh. I think that would actually
be really good for you and Evan.

to afford it now.

Do I have to move out?

-I mean. if it were up to me.
you would stay here forever.

214
00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.855
but I really don't
think that your BF

215
00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:44.024
wants to live with your BFF.

216

and he was reading to the kids
and singing to them. and...

Spanish lessons.

Okay. good. 'cause I was
freaking out a little bit

267

'cause I thought
that you told me

distracted and didn't notice.

that I gave you.

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.163
Okay.

358
00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:37.210
-Mmm!
-I told you.

359
00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:39.838
-It's good. right?
-Oh. this is good!

360
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.214
Yeah!

361
00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:43.133
-Very good call.
-Of course.

362
00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:44.467
Okay. so tell me about you.

363
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:47.345
You are an elementary
school teacher by day.

364
00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:50.181
but by night you teach
adult Spanish classes?

365
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.891
That's me!

366
00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:53.727
So do you live in the area?

367
00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.770
Uh. originally. yes.

368
00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:57.188
And then I moved
when I was younger.

369
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.940
I spent my twenties
in California.

370
00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:00.775
And. uh. yeah. my brother

371
00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.569
and his family
all still live here.

372
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.070
So what brought you back?

373
00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.407
Thank you.
Uh. phew.

374
00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:11.244
Well. my life was flipped
upside-down about a year ago.

375
00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:14.664
and I am not gonna
bore you with those details.

376
00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:19.294
Thank you.
For the horchata.

377
00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:22.422
-Of course.
So tell me. what about you?

378
00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:23.548
You have a busy schedule

379
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.175
and you're taking
my Spanish classes...

380
00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.509
Are you a glutton
for punishment?

381
00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:28.136
-It's in my DNA.

382
00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:29.554
I mean. what do you expect?

383
00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:32.349
My dad's an immigrant
from Mexico. so. you know.

384
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.684
he worked himself
to the bone and...

385
00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.105
I'm sorry.

386
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:42.233
I think about my dad
a lot around my birthday.

387
00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:45.111
I'm sorry. it's your birthday?

388
00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:46.279
No!

389
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.822
No. my birthday's
not for another month.

390
00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:50.784
but. um. I'm turning 30.

391
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.828
It's a milestone birthday.

392
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.498
It's definitely weird

393
00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.124
that he's not
gonna be here for it.

394
00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:04.005
Yeah. I hear that dads
and daughters. it's a thing.

395
00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:06.549
Well. my niece's quince
is this weekend.

396
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:07.967
and my brother. ugh!

397
00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.804
He is just going on and on
about how his little girl

398
00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.514
is becoming a woman.

399
00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:13.973
That's very sweet.

400
00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.642
Yeah. it is.

401
00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:16.726
How was your quince?

402
00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.728
Mm. I didn't have one.

403
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.438
-What?
-No!

404
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.192
Well. my mom is American
and my dad was very Americanized

405
00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.736
by the time I came along.
so no quince.

406
00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:28.905
You know. that's a common story
for a lot of Latin immigrants.

407
00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:30.156
They want to assimilate

408
00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.491
and just not be known
as different. so...

409
00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:32.784
Whoosh!

410
00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:34.327
You know.
it's kind of crazy. though.

411
00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.121
'cause not only
did I not have a quince.

412
00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.455
I've never even been to one!

413
00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.374
You're kidding.
Well. that makes sense.

414
00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:40.834
Why. you've never
tried horchata!

415
00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:44.713
Well. I'm glad we fixed that!

416
00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:46.297
What about a double quince?

417
00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.092
A what?

418
00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:50.969
You said that you
were turning 30. right?

419
00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.721
Yeah.

420
00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:55.223
So. you should have a double
quinceañera to celebrate.

421
00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:59.561
Two times fifteen.

422
00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:01.354
Come on. what better way
to honour your father

423
00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:04.024
than to embrace
your Mexican heritage?

424
00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:07.485
Did you see me
in your Spanish class?

425
00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:10.196
I don't think
a fiesta's in my future!

426
00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.323
Look. why don't you come
with me to my niece's quince

427
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.951
and you can see what
all the fuss is about?

428
00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:16.036
Like...

429
00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.537
like a date?

430
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.873
No.
No. no.

431
00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:21.833
Not a... not a date.

432
00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:24.544
Um. think of it like...

433

extra credit.

434
00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:38.475
I know you're thinking
up reasons not to go.

435
00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:40.393
Learning about
surgical dentistry seems like

436
00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:42.687
a much better use of my time.
rather than going

437
00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.397
to a fifteen-year-old's
birthday party.

438

disappoint your future husband

You literally bring out
the best in Evan.

Of course she's gonna love you.

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:33.196

-No. no. I don't want to!

-Yes!
-Go to the quince!

have to do with work

put yourself out there--

that you put on the back burner.

00:38:51.414 --> 00:38:53.375
-Oh. yeah.
Yeah. he loved history.

896
00:38:53.416 --> 00:38:56.002
Which is surprising because he
never talked about his history.

897
00:38:56.044 --> 00:38:57.462
-Really?
-Yeah.

898
00:38:57.504 --> 00:39:00.715
I mean. he also was a quiet man.

899
00:39:00.757 --> 00:39:03.051
Or maybe it was that
my mom talked so much

900
00:39:03.093 --> 00:39:05.970
he couldn't get
a word in edgewise!

901
00:39:06.012 --> 00:39:07.931
Well. look.
now you're making up for it.

902
00:39:07.972 --> 00:39:09.974
I think it's really cool
that you're wanting to stay

904
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.937
Yeah. I agree.

a little fun fact about

-It's so good.

-It originated in Mexico.
-Oh... Mexico!

an aphrodisiac.

-Fifty?

Well. okay. I'm gonna just
jump ahead here and say that

917
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.964
this is when Montezuma's
Revenge occurred.

918
00:39:41.006 --> 00:39:42.966
Bingo!
Yup!

919
00:39:43.008 --> 00:39:45.885

like the pure form of cacao.

-Ermm...
-I know you don't like sweets.

921

in their dishes. and the best.

talking to my Abuelita?

...Yes?

928
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.778
And you understood her Spanish?

929
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.738
I did.

930
00:40:04.779 --> 00:40:06.031
And actually. she told me

931
00:40:06.072 --> 00:40:08.074
I have an open invitation
into her kitchen.

932
00:40:08.116 --> 00:40:10.160

take her up on that.

a side of me that I have
never seen before!

Okay. tell me.

I need a caterer.
so do you think that your Abuela

948
00:41:26.403 --> 00:41:29.030
will make a mole for 50 people?

949
00:41:29.072 --> 00:41:31.866
I think that might be a big ask
for an 80-year-old woman.

00:41:31.908 --> 00:41:34.327
-Yeah. it might!
-But...

951

-Okay. it's been open
since the '70s.

958

00:41:54.597 --> 00:41:56.099
Eh. he's kind of a dork.

So I heard you're keeping
my mom around a little longer.

1036
00:44:45.143 --> 00:44:47.228
She told me all about
the hiring freeze

1037
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:48.980
and how she had to
postpone retirement.

1038
00:44:49.022 --> 00:44:50.690
Oh. not at all.

that she didn't feel ready

to retire yet.

I'd keep her forever.

want to retire?

she doesn't have

-Alright.
then why not just say that?

1051
00:45:14.255 --> 00:45:15.382
-I dunno. cut her some slack.

1052
00:45:15.423 --> 00:45:17.384
Maybe she's just
embarrassed to admit it.

1053
00:45:17.425 --> 00:45:19.928
Or she doesn't want you
worrying about her.

1054
00:45:22.055 --> 00:45:24.057
-That is a very
astute observation.

1055

-Thank you.

1056
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.727
Just keep taking her
to those dance classes.

retirement can be fun.

00:45:50.333 --> 00:45:52.002
JAVI: Yeah. of course.
It's so good to see you.

1068
00:45:52.043 --> 00:45:54.254
Well. this is Team Flower Power.

1069
00:45:54.295 --> 00:45:55.964
Alright. girls. what's next?

1070
00:45:56.006 --> 00:45:57.507
Uh. we need vases
on every table.

1071
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:59.300
Oh. and there is
also the tradition

1072
00:45:59.342 --> 00:46:01.428
where you lay
the flower wreath on my head.

1073
00:46:01.469 --> 00:46:03.346
[Javi chuckles]
Wow!

1074
00:46:03.388 --> 00:46:04.556
Someone's been taking notes.

1075
00:46:04.597 --> 00:46:06.975
-I have! I told you!
-[laughs] Okay.

1076
00:46:07.017 --> 00:46:08.768
Oh. uh. usually
the birthday girl

1077
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.770
picks her favourite flower
for the wreath ceremony.

1078
00:46:10.812 --> 00:46:12.355
Oh!

1079
00:46:12.397 --> 00:46:14.774
So. which one is your favourite?

1080
00:46:14.816 --> 00:46:16.401
Oh. Um...

1081
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.697
You know. I really
like this one.

1082
00:46:25.243 --> 00:46:26.536
JAVI: Good eye.

1083
00:46:27.954 --> 00:46:30.206
That is the flower of Mexico.

1084
00:46:30.248 --> 00:46:31.624
Really?

1085
00:46:31.666 --> 00:46:34.711
SHERRY: That was your father's
favourite flower.

1086
00:46:34.753 --> 00:46:36.171
Did you know that?

1087
00:46:36.212 --> 00:46:38.882
No. I didn't.

1088
00:46:38.923 --> 00:46:41.843
He chose dahlias
for my wedding bouquet.

1089

-It's kismet!

1090
00:46:44.346 --> 00:46:47.223
-Okay. why don't you girls
head over to the café?

1091
00:46:47.265 --> 00:46:49.100
I'll place the order
and join you later.

1092
00:46:51.019 --> 00:46:53.021
-I'll see you guys there.
-SHERRY: See you later.

1093
00:46:53.063 --> 00:46:55.190
CAMILA: Love you.
Thank you. Bye.

1094
00:46:55.231 --> 00:46:57.901
-I'll help you find someone.
-Great.

[door opens and bell dings]

1096
00:47:00.695 --> 00:47:02.947
MAREN: So am I gonna be
your maid of honour or what?

1097
00:47:02.989 --> 00:47:04.783
-Pretty sure that's
not a quince thing.

1098
00:47:04.824 --> 00:47:06.743
-Oh. no. I mean for
you and Javi's wedding!

1099
00:47:06.785 --> 00:47:08.078
-Mar!
-What?!

1100
00:47:08.119 --> 00:47:09.829
He is in there alone
with your mother right now.

1101
00:47:09.871 --> 00:47:11.122
-Stop!

1102
00:47:11.164 --> 00:47:12.957
-He could be asking
for your hand in marriage!

1103
00:47:12.999 --> 00:47:14.751
-He is literally just
helping us plan the quince.

1104
00:47:14.793 --> 00:47:15.877
-That's it!
-[phone buzzes]

1105
00:47:15.919 --> 00:47:17.921
Ooh. it's Evan!
He's got a hot tip.

1106
00:47:17.962 --> 00:47:20.256
A friend of a friend is thinking
of renting out his condo.

1107
00:47:20.298 --> 00:47:21.341
-Go!
-Mind if I jet?

1108
00:47:21.383 --> 00:47:23.635
-Love you! Bye!
-Love you!

1109
00:47:23.677 --> 00:47:26.721
Javi. I meant to ask you
the other day.

1110
00:47:26.763 --> 00:47:29.099
are you looking for a permanent
position at the school?

1111
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.476
Because I can
put in a good word.

1112
00:47:31.518 --> 00:47:33.395
That's very kind of you.
I. um...

1113
00:47:33.436 --> 00:47:35.563
I don't know if I'm
gonna be there long-term.

1114
00:47:35.605 --> 00:47:36.690
Oh...

1115
00:47:36.731 --> 00:47:37.774
-Thank you.

1116
00:47:39.234 --> 00:47:41.027
-Sure thing.

1117
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:44.698
I'm just so glad
Cami signed up for your class.

1118
00:47:44.739 --> 00:47:47.867
-Oh. being bilingual.
it opens up a lot of doors.

1119
00:47:47.909 --> 00:47:49.828
-Well. yeah. that too.

1120
00:47:49.869 --> 00:47:54.541
But honestly. I just want her
to have more fun in her life.

1121
00:47:54.582 --> 00:47:56.835
She puts so much
pressure on herself.

1122
00:47:56.876 --> 00:47:58.670
Always has.

1123
00:47:58.712 --> 00:48:01.673
You know. in the. uh...
pie chart of life.

1124
00:48:01.715 --> 00:48:05.802
Camila is like one
very big slice of work pie.

1125
00:48:05.844 --> 00:48:08.013
[laughs]

1126
00:48:08.054 --> 00:48:09.764
And now I'm craving pie.

1127
00:48:09.806 --> 00:48:11.307
-Me. too.

1128
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:13.685
But maybe you can relate.

1129
00:48:13.727 --> 00:48:16.813
I just-- I feel like sometimes
it's easy to get so used to

1130
00:48:16.855 --> 00:48:19.315
a work routine
that it kind of becomes daunting

1131
00:48:19.357 --> 00:48:21.651
to think about
anything else outside of that.

1132
00:48:25.405 --> 00:48:27.115
Hmm!

1133
00:48:28.742 --> 00:48:30.535
CAMILA: This is
just what I needed

1134
00:48:30.577 --> 00:48:33.038
after the day I had at work.

1135
00:48:33.079 --> 00:48:34.789
Okay. how good is that?

1136
00:48:34.831 --> 00:48:36.499
-Mmm!
-I know!

1137
00:48:36.541 --> 00:48:38.793
-What's it called again?
-It's pronounced "horchata."

1138
00:48:38.835 --> 00:48:41.171
Your dad would have loved this.

1139
00:48:43.256 --> 00:48:44.924
Mom. can I talk to you
about something?

1140
00:48:44.966 --> 00:48:46.718
Sure.

1141
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.472
[Latin music playing
in background]

1142
00:48:50.513 --> 00:48:54.267
So... I ran into Principal Lee.

1143
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:56.144
Oh. really?

1144
00:48:56.186 --> 00:48:57.729
That's nice.

1145
00:48:59.481 --> 00:49:01.483
What did she have to say?

1146
00:49:03.651 --> 00:49:08.615
Well. she told me that they're
not in a hiring freeze

1147
00:49:08.656 --> 00:49:11.159
and that you decided
not to retire.

1148
00:49:11.201 --> 00:49:13.620
So why are you putting it off?

1149
00:49:13.661 --> 00:49:16.247
Especially after
everything with Dad.

1150
00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.125
I mean.
we're not promised tomorrow.

1151
00:49:19.167 --> 00:49:21.002
so why are you waiting?

1152
00:49:24.005 --> 00:49:26.091
[sighs]

1153
00:49:26.132 --> 00:49:30.095
For years. your dad and I
dreamed of retirement.

1154
00:49:30.136 --> 00:49:34.057
All the exciting things
we were gonna do!

1155
00:49:34.099 --> 00:49:38.645
But without him
to share it with. it just...

1156
00:49:40.397 --> 00:49:42.190
seems pointless.

1157
00:49:49.447 --> 00:49:52.826
Mom. I'm sorry.

1158
00:49:52.867 --> 00:49:56.746
I'm not sure
who I am without him. Cam.

1159
00:49:59.666 --> 00:50:04.713
And at least if I am working.

1160
00:50:04.754 --> 00:50:07.048
I know how to fill up my day.

1161
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.509
Well. Mom.
I think you're doing great.

1162
00:50:09.551 --> 00:50:11.761
I mean. look at you.
You took up a new hobby.

1163
00:50:11.803 --> 00:50:14.014
I mean. you're dancing now.

1164
00:50:14.055 --> 00:50:16.641
You've been
taking night classes.

1165
00:50:16.683 --> 00:50:20.020
You're enjoying that. right?

1166
00:50:20.061 --> 00:50:21.855
Very much.

1167

I do. too.

bringing new people
into your life and having fun.

1176
00:51:01.436 --> 00:51:04.981
that doesn't diminish
the love that you have for Dad.

1177

I mean.
he would want that for us.

to those moves.

Ow! Oh. I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

It's just... it's. um...

1252
00:54:19.092 --> 00:54:20.010
just little cut.
It's tiny.

1253

I am pretty sure your Abuela
just put a spell on me.

1260
00:54:38.236 --> 00:54:39.779
-Oh. she did.

1261
00:54:39.821 --> 00:54:41.573
It was a love spell.

1262
00:54:41.614 --> 00:54:45.118
No. it's a thing that we say
when kids get hurt.

1263
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.955
It actually translates to
"Heal. little frog."

1264
00:54:48.997 --> 00:54:50.582
-That's...
-Weird.

1265

-Yeah. weird!
[laughs]

1266

-Yeah. they're pretty amazing.

00:56:09.369 --> 00:56:11.996
Javi. I have not had
this much fun in.

1291
00:56:12.038 --> 00:56:13.665
well. I don't even
know how long.

just come to the quince?

Is it too late to ask them?

1296

JAVI: Okay. be careful
what you wish for.

1297

all of 'em!

00:57:11.556 --> 00:57:13.391
Did I do something wrong?

1310
00:57:14.893 --> 00:57:16.269
Wrong? No.

1311
00:57:16.311 --> 00:57:17.729
No. not at all.

1312
00:57:19.773 --> 00:57:21.983
That kiss was perfect.

1313
00:57:22.025 --> 00:57:23.860
You. you are perfect.

1314
00:57:25.236 --> 00:57:26.738
But...

1315
00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.868
Ah...

1316
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:33.620
I really like you. Camila.

1317
00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.750
And I really enjoyed helping you
get ready for your quince.

1318
00:57:38.792 --> 00:57:41.628
Javi. I'm still waiting
for the "but."

1319
00:57:44.047 --> 00:57:45.674
But...

1320
00:57:47.634 --> 00:57:50.804
I'm not ready
for anything serious.

1321
00:57:50.845 --> 00:57:52.097
It scares me.

1322
00:57:52.138 --> 00:57:53.515
It's kinda hard to explain.
I...

1323
00:57:53.556 --> 00:57:56.434
-No. no. but please.
please try to.

1324
00:58:00.397 --> 00:58:04.567
Camila. you...

1325
00:58:04.609 --> 00:58:07.987
are absolutely wonderful.
in every way.

1326
00:58:11.157 --> 00:58:12.784
This is my baggage.

1327
00:58:12.826 --> 00:58:14.536
No. no. Javi. please
don't do the whole

1328
00:58:14.577 --> 00:58:16.454
"It's not you. it's me" thing.

1329
00:58:16.496 --> 00:58:19.666
No. no. no. no. no.
it's the truth. okay?

1330
00:58:19.708 --> 00:58:20.959
I...

1331
00:58:21.001 --> 00:58:24.087
Look. whatever happened
in my past relationship.

None of it matters. okay?

1334
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:31.594

been able to shake it.

Hi. Mom!

-Hey!
-Thank you for coming over.

1353
00:59:37.702 --> 00:59:38.995
-Of course. darling.

1354

-Come here.
-Mmm!

1355
00:59:40.372 --> 00:59:42.457
-Come get cozy on the couch.
-Muah!

1356
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:46.586
What's up?

1357
00:59:50.048 --> 00:59:51.841
Talk to me. sweetie.

1358
00:59:51.883 --> 00:59:54.010
What's wrong?

1359
00:59:57.722 --> 00:59:59.849
Javi doesn't want to date me.

1360
00:59:59.891 --> 01:00:01.518
-You told him how you feel?

1361
01:00:01.559 --> 01:00:03.019
Oh. yeah!

1362
01:00:03.061 --> 01:00:06.648
And he practically sprinted
in the other direction!

1363
01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:07.691
[sighs]

1364
01:00:07.732 --> 01:00:09.275
Oh...

1365
01:00:09.317 --> 01:00:11.861
But Mom.
before he blindsided me.

1366
01:00:11.903 --> 01:00:17.909
we had this kiss
and it was so magical. and...

1367
01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:21.162
there were these seconds
between him kissing me

1368
01:00:21.204 --> 01:00:23.915
and before the bad news

1369
01:00:23.957 --> 01:00:26.751
that it really felt like.

1370
01:00:26.793 --> 01:00:29.379
I don't know.
like we could be something.

1371
01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:30.714
And...

1372
01:00:30.755 --> 01:00:32.549
he doesn't feel the same way?

1373
01:00:35.093 --> 01:00:38.847
His past just has
such a strong hold over him

1374
01:00:38.888 --> 01:00:41.391
and he can't shake it.

1375
01:00:42.809 --> 01:00:44.602
Well...

1376
01:00:44.644 --> 01:00:46.730
I know that feeling.

1377
01:00:46.771 --> 01:00:48.982
-What do you mean?

1378
01:00:49.024 --> 01:00:54.070
I dipped the tiniest of toes
in the world of romance.

1379
01:00:54.112 --> 01:00:56.865
and it was like bungee jumping.

1380
01:00:56.906 --> 01:00:59.659
My heart was beating so fast!

1381
01:00:59.701 --> 01:01:02.120
Mom!
Oh. come here!

1382
01:01:03.705 --> 01:01:05.457
SHERRY: Ohh...

1383
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.420
Past relationships.
they leave their marks.

1384
01:01:12.964 --> 01:01:15.717
Your father certainly did
on the both of us.

1385
01:01:24.476 --> 01:01:25.894
He did great!

1386
01:01:25.935 --> 01:01:27.937
There you go.
Go to Mommy!

1387
01:01:27.979 --> 01:01:29.564
Good job.
Keep brushing your teeth.

1388

-Dr. Lopez?
-Yes?

1389
01:01:31.941 --> 01:01:33.485
Cam. I'd like to talk
to you about something.

1390
01:01:33.526 --> 01:01:35.028
-Okay?

1391
01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:38.114
I wanted to thank you for
taking on so many of my patients

1392
01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:39.908
as I start to scale back.

1393
01:01:39.949 --> 01:01:41.284
-Of course!
-Right there.

1394
01:01:41.326 --> 01:01:43.953
In fact. I've delayed
looking for another dentist

1395
01:01:43.995 --> 01:01:47.957
to join the practice
because I think

1396
01:01:47.999 --> 01:01:50.460
it should be your choice
who we hire.

1397
01:01:50.502 --> 01:01:52.629
-Wow.

1398
01:01:52.671 --> 01:01:55.298
Uh. thank you.
That means a lot.

1399
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:58.176
-Well. you mean
a lot to this practice.

1400
01:01:58.218 --> 01:02:01.513
That's why. when I retire.

1401
01:02:01.554 --> 01:02:04.349
I want to leave it to you.

1402
01:02:04.391 --> 01:02:06.101
Really?

1403
01:02:06.142 --> 01:02:08.645
Well...
Wow. I...

1404
01:02:08.687 --> 01:02:10.855
I don't even know what to say.

1405
01:02:10.897 --> 01:02:12.440
Well. don't say
anything just yet.

1406
01:02:12.482 --> 01:02:15.026
Think it over.
It's a lot of responsibility.

1407
01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:16.778
-Well. I can handle
responsibility.

1408
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.030
-Oh. I have
no doubt of that.

1409
01:02:19.072 --> 01:02:20.615
but you've gotta want to.

1410
01:02:20.657 --> 01:02:22.409
That's the difference.

1411
01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:23.743
Here you go.

Oh...

1415
01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:41.720
Oh. no.

1416
01:02:41.761 --> 01:02:42.929
-It's not...

1417
01:02:42.971 --> 01:02:45.181
that bad.

1418
01:02:45.223 --> 01:02:47.350
Mar. I look like
Little Red Riding Hood

1419
01:02:47.392 --> 01:02:49.811
skipped Grandma's house
and went to prom.

1420
01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:51.688
At least it's rojo!

1421
01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:53.606
Oh!

1422
01:02:53.648 --> 01:02:55.358
How did this happen?

1423
01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.486
Uh. essentially. um.
because you told her

1424
01:02:58.528 --> 01:02:59.529
to do her thing.

1425
01:02:59.571 --> 01:03:00.989
So she...

1426
01:03:01.031 --> 01:03:02.699
she did her thing.

1427
01:03:02.741 --> 01:03:04.367
-Ugh!

1428
01:03:04.409 --> 01:03:08.705
Well. I mean.
I can't wear this. right?

1429
01:03:08.747 --> 01:03:11.458
You strut into that party
with confidence.

1430
01:03:11.499 --> 01:03:14.586
and I truly believe
you could make anything work.

1431
01:03:17.339 --> 01:03:20.091
[quietly] Okay. okay.
Maybe you ask Lupe

1432
01:03:20.133 --> 01:03:21.551
to remake the dress?

1433
01:03:21.593 --> 01:03:22.719
[quietly] By tomorrow?!

1434
01:03:22.761 --> 01:03:24.721
No. there's no chance!

1435
01:03:24.763 --> 01:03:26.598
[sighs] You know what?

1436
01:03:26.639 --> 01:03:27.682
It's okay.

1437
01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:29.559
I am going to pay for this

1438
01:03:29.601 --> 01:03:31.728
and I will go buy something
at the mall.

1439
01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:33.021
Oh. no!

1440
01:03:33.063 --> 01:03:34.898
No. no. no.
you can't buy off the rack

1441
01:03:34.939 --> 01:03:36.274
for something this important.

1442
01:03:36.316 --> 01:03:38.526
Well. uh. okay.
then I'll rent something.

1443
01:03:38.568 --> 01:03:40.195
No!
No. no!

1444
01:03:40.236 --> 01:03:42.822
-Well. what do you want me
to do with all of this?

1445
01:03:42.864 --> 01:03:44.491
Okay. I...

1446
01:03:44.532 --> 01:03:45.867
Ooh!
I...

1447
01:03:47.619 --> 01:03:49.245
I will make you a dress.

1448
01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:53.124
-Ah!
-Okay. no. no. it's okay.

1449
01:03:55.251 --> 01:03:57.837
[exhales in relief]

1450
01:03:57.879 --> 01:03:59.547

1451
01:03:59.589 --> 01:04:01.132
[loud rips]

1452
01:04:01.174 --> 01:04:03.093
Oh. wow...
Okay!

1453
01:04:03.134 --> 01:04:05.095
Thank you for staying up
late to do this.

1454
01:04:05.136 --> 01:04:06.513
You are amazing.

1455
01:04:06.554 --> 01:04:08.640
And tomorrow.
my mom and I are gonna handle

1456
01:04:08.682 --> 01:04:10.350
everything pre-party
so you can sleep in.

1457
01:04:10.392 --> 01:04:12.268
-Oh. no. no.
I'm happy to do it!

1458
01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:15.855
Plus. a little stress
will help me sew faster.

1459
01:04:15.897 --> 01:04:17.732
-I love this.

1460
01:04:17.774 --> 01:04:19.109
Can we use this?

1461
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:20.860
-Yes. of course.
-Thank you!

1462
01:04:20.902 --> 01:04:22.404
[both giggle]

1463
01:04:22.445 --> 01:04:23.822
Ooh!
What happened with the condo?

1464
01:04:23.863 --> 01:04:25.240
Is it a go?

1465
01:04:25.281 --> 01:04:27.283
Oh. no.
No. no.

1466
01:04:27.325 --> 01:04:29.703
Evan's friend of a friend
forgot to mention

1467
01:04:29.744 --> 01:04:32.205
one very important detail--

1468
01:04:32.247 --> 01:04:34.624
he planned to live
in the other bedroom.

1469
01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:35.959
-Oh...
-Yeah.

1470
01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:37.627
Sorry.

1471
01:04:37.669 --> 01:04:40.880
It's fine. We just have to.
uh. adjust our expectations.

1472
01:04:44.592 --> 01:04:46.845
Well. what if...

1473
01:04:46.886 --> 01:04:48.763
What if you guys didn't have to?

1474
01:04:49.973 --> 01:04:52.017
What do you mean?

1475
01:04:52.058 --> 01:04:53.768
[sighs]

1476
01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:55.395
I don't know.

1477
01:04:55.437 --> 01:04:57.772
just with everything that's
gone on this past month.

1478
01:04:57.814 --> 01:05:00.608
I'm just kind of thinking
why I got into dentistry

1479
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:02.193
in the first place.

1480
01:05:02.235 --> 01:05:03.486
To help people.

1481
01:05:03.528 --> 01:05:04.988
Like Barb.

1482
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:07.240
[laughs] Barb...

1483
01:05:10.035 --> 01:05:12.328
Do you remember in college

1484
01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.164
when I almost went to
work with a non-profit

1485
01:05:14.205 --> 01:05:16.332
and they would do dentistry

1486
01:05:16.374 --> 01:05:20.587
in all sorts of
underprivileged areas?

1487
01:05:20.628 --> 01:05:22.130
I do remember.

1488
01:05:22.172 --> 01:05:24.090
You asked Dr. Benoit
to sponsor the program

1489
01:05:24.132 --> 01:05:25.842
when you first started
working with him.

1490
01:05:25.884 --> 01:05:29.346
Well. I looked it up and they...

1491
01:05:29.387 --> 01:05:31.389
have some positions
open in Mexico.

1492
01:05:33.099 --> 01:05:35.852
And I was thinking...

1493
01:05:35.894 --> 01:05:38.521
what if I move to Mexico?

1494
01:05:38.563 --> 01:05:41.358
I mean. I can continue
to learn Spanish.

1495
01:05:41.399 --> 01:05:44.611
and I could really get into
my roots and find out

1496
01:05:44.652 --> 01:05:46.071
more about
where my dad came from.

1497
01:05:46.112 --> 01:05:47.572
And...

1498
01:05:49.741 --> 01:05:52.744
I just feel like that's
where I'm supposed to be.

1499
01:05:56.873 --> 01:05:59.084
I think it's a great idea.

1500
01:05:59.125 --> 01:06:01.169
Really?

1501
01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:02.420
Yes!

1502
01:06:06.424 --> 01:06:09.678
If you go.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1503
01:06:09.719 --> 01:06:11.554
Oh!

1504
01:06:11.596 --> 01:06:13.765
But I am totally turning your
room into my sewing room.

1505
01:06:13.807 --> 01:06:15.266
Oh. wow.

1506
01:06:15.308 --> 01:06:17.018
-Muah!
-Wow.

1507
01:06:20.146 --> 01:06:21.773
[sighs]

1508
01:06:32.367 --> 01:06:33.451
Here's a few more.

1509
01:06:33.493 --> 01:06:34.619
-Oh. wow.

1510
01:06:34.661 --> 01:06:36.287
Thank you.

1511
01:06:37.539 --> 01:06:39.416
Buenos días. birthday girl!

1512
01:06:39.457 --> 01:06:40.959
Hi. Mom.

1513
01:06:41.001 --> 01:06:42.252
-Hi!

1514
01:06:42.293 --> 01:06:45.338
Brought your favourite--
bagels from Just My Lox.

1515
01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.631
Thank you.

1516
01:06:46.673 --> 01:06:48.008
How are you feeling?

1517
01:06:48.049 --> 01:06:49.551
Nervous.

1518
01:06:49.592 --> 01:06:51.011
Excited.

1519
01:06:52.721 --> 01:06:53.596
[sighs]

1520
01:06:55.015 --> 01:06:57.475
[office phones
ringing in background]

1521
01:06:57.517 --> 01:07:00.186
I have to tell Dr. Benoit
by the end of the day

1522
01:07:00.228 --> 01:07:03.440
whether or not I want
to take over the practice.

1523
01:07:03.481 --> 01:07:05.942
-Well...

1524
01:07:05.984 --> 01:07:08.570
you were the one who told me
to take a leap. didn't you?

1525
01:07:09.696 --> 01:07:11.072
Yes.

1526
01:07:13.783 --> 01:07:15.994
Have you heard from Javi?

1527
01:07:20.874 --> 01:07:25.545
If you want him there
as a friend.

1528
01:07:25.587 --> 01:07:27.464
you really should call him.

1529
01:07:27.505 --> 01:07:30.133
*

1530
01:07:30.175 --> 01:07:32.469
It just got really
complicated. Mom.

1531
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:36.639
*

1532
01:07:36.681 --> 01:07:39.559
-Whatever you decide.
you have worked really hard

1533
01:07:39.601 --> 01:07:43.313
and I want you to enjoy every
minute because you deserve it.

1534

CAMILA: Hi!

1538
01:07:56.451 --> 01:07:58.536
MAREN: Uh. I think I started
hallucinating just a little bit.

1539
01:07:58.578 --> 01:07:59.537
but I finished!

1540
01:07:59.579 --> 01:08:01.831
And...?

1541
01:08:01.873 --> 01:08:03.750
What do you think?

[gasps]

1543
01:08:07.253 --> 01:08:08.630
You hate it.

-You hate it!
-No!

1545
01:08:10.215 --> 01:08:11.341
No.

1546
01:08:11.383 --> 01:08:13.134
-I love it!
-Oh!

1547
01:08:13.176 --> 01:08:15.345
I just-- I don't even have
enough words to tell you

1548
01:08:15.387 --> 01:08:16.554
how much I love it!

1549
01:08:16.596 --> 01:08:17.722
Okay. well. don't
get too excited.

1550
01:08:17.764 --> 01:08:19.099
You have to try it on first.

1551
01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:22.102
-Thank you.
-But also. um...

1552
01:08:22.143 --> 01:08:23.228
What?

01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:27.315
*

1554
01:08:27.357 --> 01:08:28.274
Hi.

1555
01:08:30.235 --> 01:08:31.277
Hey.

1556
01:08:31.778 --> 01:08:33.113
Mar?

1557
01:08:33.154 --> 01:08:35.198
I-I told him you were.
uh. running errands

1558
01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.283
and he said he could wait.

1559
01:08:38.785 --> 01:08:43.164
So I'm just gonna let you two
have your. uh. "conversacíon."

1560
01:08:50.755 --> 01:08:52.590
Feliz Cumpleaños!

1561
01:08:52.632 --> 01:08:54.259
Thank you.

1562
01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:56.761
Big 3-0!

1563
01:08:56.803 --> 01:08:59.472
-And. uh.
it's a big night tonight.

1564
01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.183
Yeah. it's a big night.

1565
01:09:03.685 --> 01:09:05.395
Well. you've worked really hard.

1566
01:09:05.437 --> 01:09:06.938
You should be proud.

1567
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:09.065
Oh. I mean. it took a team.

1568
01:09:10.608 --> 01:09:13.069
Well. I just wanted you to know
that tonight's gonna be amazing.

1569
01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:15.238
just like you.

1570
01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.614
Thank you.

1571
01:09:18.992 --> 01:09:20.618
Is that. uh.
what you came here to tell me?

1572
01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:22.620
Ah!
[nervous laugh]

1573
01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:25.123
No. no.
No. actually. um...

1574
01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:30.420
I-I have some really good news.

1575
01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:34.007
Uh. I spoke to the HR department
at the school

1576
01:09:34.049 --> 01:09:35.508
and I told them
that I was interested

1577
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:37.969
in a full-time position.

1578
01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:41.264
and they said that there's
actually an opportunity

1579
01:09:41.306 --> 01:09:43.516
as a fourth-grade teacher
next year.

1580
01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:47.437
Wow!

1581
01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:49.397
I mean. that's...

1582
01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:50.774
really incredible.

1583
01:09:50.815 --> 01:09:53.735
Yes. and I'm gonna take it.
and I'm gonna stay here.

1584
01:09:53.777 --> 01:09:54.986
I'm gonna stick around.

1585
01:09:55.028 --> 01:09:57.864
I'm gonna plant
some roots and I...

1586
01:09:57.906 --> 01:10:00.116
You-- you inspire me. Camila.

1587
01:10:01.201 --> 01:10:03.536
You commit to
everything you do. 100%.

1588
01:10:05.872 --> 01:10:08.041
That's the person
that I want to be. too.

1589
01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:11.461
Javi. I'm so happy for you.

1590
01:10:11.503 --> 01:10:15.298
Hey. I'm sorry
about the other night.

1591
01:10:16.758 --> 01:10:18.551
After Elena. I...

1592
01:10:21.221 --> 01:10:24.432
Look. I tend to run away
from everything.

1593
01:10:24.474 --> 01:10:27.602
I go from one place
to the next and I just...

1594
01:10:27.644 --> 01:10:30.021
I'm scared.
