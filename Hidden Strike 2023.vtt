3
00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:58.833
After surviving
relentless attacks from
mercenary forces

4
00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:00.500
in the escalating oil wars.

5
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.750
sources tell us that pleas
have finally been answered

6
00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:07.333
for the besieged employees
of Yutime Chinese oil refinery

7
00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:08.541
in the Middle East.

8
00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:11.708
Professor Cheng.
Yutime's Director of Operations.

9
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:15.208
tells us that a private security
team from China has volunteered

10
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:19.041
to carry out the high-risk
mission of extracting her
trapped oil workers.

11
00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:20.666
who are facing certain death.

12
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.500
and escorting them
to the safety of the Green Zone.

13
00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:38.875
Commander Luo.

14
00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.416
we're approaching the LZ.

15
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.750
Copy. Captain.

16
00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:10.625
-Dragon Luo.
-Yes.

17
00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:12.000
Professor Cheng.
head of Yutime Oil.

18
00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:12.958
Hello. professor.

19
00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:15.375
Thank you for coming
to rescue us.

20
00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:17.041
Can you bring me up to speed?

21
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:19.583
-Of course. follow me.
-HaiMing. unload.

22
00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:20.625
You two. follow me. Hurry up.

23
00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:21.541
Yes. sir.

24
00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:24.375
We are only
safe inside the refinery.

25
00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:27.083
Don't worry.
we're here to escort you out.

26
00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:30.000
Our planes are waiting for you
in the Green Zone.

27
00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:32.000
Do you know who the rebels are?

28
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.166
I don't know.

29
00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:35.208
They want us to give
up the refinery.

30
00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:37.166
We've been surrounded
for two weeks.

31
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.541
They launch an attack
every couple of days.

32
00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:41.833
We've increased our security

33
00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:43.875
but if they launch another
attack like yesterday.

34
00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.541
we won't make it.

35
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.958
We must evacuate immediately.

36
00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:49.708
How many
are we evacuating?

37
00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:52.000
Four hundred
and ninety eight including the
children.

38
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:56.416
There's a lot
of things to do before we go.

39
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.750
We plan to leave at dawn.

40
00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.458
Gets it all and
is happy with it.

41
00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:05.916
Looks happy. looks concerned.
He's concerned now.

42
00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:08.541
It's in the sand.

43
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.458
I made it.

44
00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:16.958
How's it going. Chris?

45
00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:18.375
You're late. Henry.

46
00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.833
Jesus. Chris.

47
00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:23.791
Here's your money. as promised.

48
00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:27.875
We go in and out. Nobody hurt.

49
00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:31.625
You're gonna count it?

50
00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:33.375
Hell yeah. I'm gonna count it.

51
00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:35.208
Listen. you're family
but you're a thief.

52
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:36.041
Ah.

53
00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:37.958
Bald Eagle over there.
he doesn't care if I count it.

54
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.583
Bit of a misread on me.
I think he does care if I count
it.

55
00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:43.875
Or-or was it the nickname?

56
00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:44.958
You guys do nicknames?

57
00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:47.666
You guys don't do nicknames.

58
00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:51.500
Are you kidding me? Nicknames
are like the heart of team
camaraderie.

59
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.291
Huh. you guys are in luck.
nicknames are like my
superpower.

60
00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:55.708
I've been giving 'em out
since peewee football.

61
00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:56.625
Yeah. bro.

62
00:04:56.708 --> 00:04:58.041
these guys are a
little bit on edge.

63
00:04:58.125 --> 00:04:59.291
I'm gonna take the edge off.

64
00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:00.041
Okay.

65
00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:01.125
Bald Eagle.

66
00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:02.375
like the one from the Muppets.

67
00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:03.583
Toothpick.

68
00:05:03.666 --> 00:05:06.125
There's a double meaning.
You'll figure it out.

69
00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:06.958
Uh.

70
00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:08.833
Tomb Raider. because I just--

71
00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:11.500
I just feel like you'll haunt me
long after I'm dead.

72
00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:17.708
Uh…

73
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.916
Full disclosure.
there's a lot going on here. uh…

74
00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:24.791
I'm drawn to "Graffiti"

75
00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:27.166
'cause it looks like some
teenagers vandalized your face.

76
00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.000
That's not it.

77
00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:30.875
It's just a start for
me. but I got you.

78
00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:31.750
Bro.

79
00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:33.750
can you be serious
for one second?

80
00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.666
Have you given any more thought
to my plan?

81
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.166
Like. one more mission.
five times the money?

82
00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:41.291
Can't do it.
I've already done way too much.

83
00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:44.166
You're telling me this place
couldn't use more money to fix
things up?

84
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.083
Don't start.

85
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.208
Yeah. well. it's a big job.

86
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:48.458
-No.
-Moving target.

87
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:49.166
No.

88
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.875
And it's for Unicorp. bro.

89
00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:51.875
Not interested.

90
00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.833
You remember that rebel attack
on Area Seven. don't you?

91
00:05:55.708 --> 00:05:57.708
When five of our
guys got popped.

92
00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:01.708
This is the son of a
bitch who armed them.

93
00:06:02.708 --> 00:06:03.833
And right now

94
00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:06.583
a team of mercenaries
is escorting this dirtbag back
to China.

95
00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:07.916
You wanna take on the Chinese?

96
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.916
No. no. no. It's
not the Chinese.

97
00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:12.833
It's an international
criminal. all right?

98
00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:14.958
She's being extracted
on the Highway of Death

99
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.500
back to the Green Zone.

100
00:06:16.583 --> 00:06:17.708
Big Dog. come on.

101
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.833
Stay there. I'll pick you up.

102
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.375
Highway of Death?

103
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:24.791
The most dangerous
road in the country.

104
00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:25.875
You know that.

105
00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:27.958
You're an idiot
for even thinking about it.

106
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:31.708
Yeah. Dad would've
done it. though.

107
00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:39.166
That was low.

108
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.250
Even for you.

109
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.625
Keep your eye on the ball. okay?

110
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.291
Almost. almost.

111
00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:01.250
Now let's let it
rip. Hit the mitt.

112
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.041
Whoa.

113
00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:05.083
Fantastic.

114
00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:12.791
You got it. Funhouse. come on.

115
00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:15.833
Hey. Soraya.

116
00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:18.125
Hello. Owen.

117
00:07:19.833 --> 00:07:21.333
You look beautiful today.

118
00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:23.500
What? No!

119
00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:26.625
I hope you don't mind me
saying. but that. um. abaya.

120
00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:29.000
it really makes
your. your skin glow.

121
00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:30.333
Owen. stop.

122
00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:33.333
Always working.

123
00:07:33.416 --> 00:07:34.833
No harder than you. my friend.

124
00:07:37.208 --> 00:07:38.541
So what about the pipe?

125
00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:41.458
It's bone dry.

126
00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:43.416
And you're wasting your time.

127
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.583
Pump's rusted.

128
00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:47.000
Pipe's disconnected.

129
00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:55.958
Damn. I hate this company.

130
00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:58.250
Well. I hate we
don't have water.

131
00:07:58.333 --> 00:07:59.333
Yeah.

132
00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:00.541
I mean. I have a little.

133
00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:03.000
I got buckets and charcoal.
so we bring a little at a time.
but

134
00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:05.625
it's not enough.
I mean. they built that dam.

135
00:08:05.708 --> 00:08:07.000
They cut this place off.

136
00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:11.541
If you want.
I can go talk to Unicorp
headquarters

137
00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:13.458
but you know how that goes.

138
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:14.875
You want us to
bribe 'em for water?

139
00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.416
There's only one thing
more expensive than oil.

140
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.541
Water.

141
00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:22.000
The more desperate.
the more expensive.

142
00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:22.958
How much?

143
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.958
Probably a 100 grand.

144
00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:31.708
I'm sorry. I'm doing all I can.

145
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:33.250
It's just that it--

146
00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:43.875
I'll get a crew together
if you guys can get the money.

147
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:45.958
Okay.

148
00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:47.833
Do what you can.

149
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.416
This place is gonna die
without water. man.

150
00:08:55.375 --> 00:08:56.750
The weather conditions are
clear.

151
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:01.041
Let them know
we'll arrive at the Green Zone
in two groups.

152
00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:02.791
One at nine a.m.. the
second at four p.m.

153
00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:03.958
Got it.

154
00:09:04.041 --> 00:09:05.250
English. please.

155
00:09:05.708 --> 00:09:06.875
What about air recon?

156
00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:10.000
Your primary and secondary
routes to the Green Zone are
hostile.

157
00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:12.833
Sir. all the other
options are rebel controlled.

158
00:09:14.708 --> 00:09:17.166
Then we're still taking
the Highway of Death.

159
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.500
It's the fastest way

160
00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:20.291
from here to the Green Zone.

161
00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:21.833
Nonstop. eight hours.

162
00:09:34.333 --> 00:09:35.375
Chris.

163
00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:39.000
where are we going
to get the $100.000?

164
00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:43.458
I'll think of something.

165
00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:45.250
Okay.

166
00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:00.750
Sector four. ready.

167
00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.125
Sector three. ready.

168
00:10:03.583 --> 00:10:04.500
Sector two. ready.

169
00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:05.958
Sector one. ready.

170
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.166
We
are shutting down.

171
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.250
Got it.

172
00:10:13.166 --> 00:10:15.625
Professor. we need the dongle.

173
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.500
You
feeling better?

174
00:10:31.708 --> 00:10:32.666
Not really.

175
00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:39.041
System off.

176
00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:42.708
Mei. hold my bag
for me. -Okay.

177
00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:44.041
Be careful.

178
00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:48.458
Professor. we must go right
away.

179
00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:51.000
Get ready. everyone. we're
going!

180
00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.416
-Do a head count.
-Yes. sir.

181
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.500
Come on.

182
00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:03.916
Follow me.

183
00:11:04.708 --> 00:11:05.791
Come on. come on.

184
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:12.333
Professor.
there's still another seat on
bus eight.

185
00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:14.333
You can go with your assistant.

186
00:11:14.416 --> 00:11:16.208
Excellent. Let's go.

187
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:17.875
But
you are on bus one.

188
00:11:21.083 --> 00:11:22.083
Okay.

189
00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:23.333
I'll see you in the Green Zone.

190
00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:24.625
Please be careful.

191
00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.250
Dr. Mei.

192
00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.041
I saved a seat for you.

193
00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:52.125
Shadow Squad.

194
00:11:55.791 --> 00:11:56.833
Let's go!

195
00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:57.916
Yes. sir.

196
00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:10.458
Move out.

197
00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:11.833
You hold tight.

198
00:12:12.291 --> 00:12:14.041
Okay. let's go.

199
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.000
Commander Luo.

200
00:12:32.583 --> 00:12:34.833
the helicopters are pushing
ahead to the Green Zone.

201
00:12:35.875 --> 00:12:37.000
You're on your own now.

202
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.458
Radio check one.

203
00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:51.541
Two check.

204
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:53.458
Three check.

205
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.708
Four check.

206
00:12:56.083 --> 00:12:56.791
Five check.

207
00:12:57.583 --> 00:12:58.333
Six check.

208
00:12:59.541 --> 00:13:00.375
Seven check.

209
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:01.708
Eight check.

210
00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:02.875
Nine check.

211
00:13:03.708 --> 00:13:04.541
Ten check.

212
00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:06.041
Eleven check.

213
00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:22.750
You can't stand the whole way.

214
00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:24.208
Road's bumpy. it's dangerous.

215
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:26.875
I'm fine.

216
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.583
More
stubborn than your mom.

217
00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:37.708
So you
still remember her?

218
00:14:03.666 --> 00:14:05.041
The Highway of Death.

219
00:14:05.833 --> 00:14:06.875
It looks so tragic.

220
00:14:09.416 --> 00:14:11.375
A lot of people
died here during the war.

221
00:14:11.458 --> 00:14:12.875
It's still dangerous here.

222
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:14.583
Don't worry. we'll be okay.

223
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.500
Watch the sides.

224
00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:18.916
Prepare yourselves.

225
00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:23.625
Please sit down.

226
00:14:24.125 --> 00:14:25.125
Hm?

227
00:14:32.916 --> 00:14:33.916
Seatbelt please.

228
00:14:59.916 --> 00:15:01.083
There's
a minefield ahead.

229
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:03.625
I can
see them coming!

230
00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:07.458
I
know. Don't worry.

231
00:15:09.416 --> 00:15:11.208
Stay in formation. Be careful.

232
00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:15.416
What
are you doing?

233
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.833
There's
no mines there.

234
00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:02.541
You see?

235
00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:04.666
It's all a trap.

236
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.500
They want to lure you in

237
00:16:07.916 --> 00:16:09.875
somewhere you think is safe
and take your life.

238
00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:31.333
Mei.

239
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.000
I'm here to protect you.

240
00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.166
You are here to be a hero not
for me.

241
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.541
but for them.

242
00:16:42.833 --> 00:16:44.958
Your name was on the evacuation
list.

243
00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:52.375
So.

244
00:16:53.291 --> 00:16:55.666
you brought your team
all the way here to save me

245
00:16:56.375 --> 00:16:57.500
just for my forgiveness?

246
00:16:58.041 --> 00:16:59.041
It's not gonna happen.

247
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.208
You broke my mom's heart.

248
00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:02.708
And mine as well.

249
00:17:02.791 --> 00:17:04.125
I'll never forgive you.

250
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.625
It was your mom
who took you away from me.

251
00:17:06.708 --> 00:17:09.166
That's just
because you never cared about
us.

252
00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:12.333
My mom was lying
there in the hospital.

253
00:17:13.916 --> 00:17:15.666
she couldn't get out of bed

254
00:17:16.458 --> 00:17:19.250
but you never bothered to visit
her. not even once.

255
00:17:24.166 --> 00:17:25.666
How could you be so cruel?

256
00:17:26.666 --> 00:17:28.916
I was on a top secret mission.

257
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Our country needed me.

258
00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:31.833
Our
country needed you?

259
00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:33.625
Right.

260
00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:36.375
What about me?

261
00:17:37.208 --> 00:17:38.750
I was so little.

262
00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:42.208
Mom was in the hospital.
she needed you more.

263
00:17:47.083 --> 00:17:48.583
But what have you done for us?

264
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.250
As an engineer here.

265
00:18:00.291 --> 00:18:01.291
I'm grateful for you.

266
00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:03.375
But as your daughter.

267
00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:06.166
there's nothing left to say.

268
00:18:10.708 --> 00:18:12.250
Dragon.
on your one o'clock.

269
00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:20.625
Attention. everybody.

270
00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:22.583
There's a sandstorm up ahead.

271
00:18:28.666 --> 00:18:29.500
QiXing.

272
00:18:29.583 --> 00:18:31.416
didn't you say the
weather was clear?

273
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.333
I've been keeping an eye on the
data.

274
00:18:33.416 --> 00:18:35.541
It shows
the chance of a sandstorm here
is zero.

275
00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:38.041
If we don't
keep going. we'll miss our
window.

276
00:18:38.125 --> 00:18:39.583
Jing and Yan. close the hatches.

277
00:18:39.666 --> 00:18:41.750
We need to get through
as fast as possible.

278
00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.750
This sandstorm is very unusual.

279
00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:13.333
HaiMing.

280
00:19:15.625 --> 00:19:16.625
HaiMing?

281
00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:19.625
HaiMing. do you copy?

282
00:19:20.708 --> 00:19:22.458
I
don't copy either.

283
00:19:23.416 --> 00:19:24.083
ShenWei?

284
00:19:24.708 --> 00:19:25.708
Yan?

285
00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.375
Strange. there is no signal.

286
00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:31.416
Hey. is that--

287
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.125
What?

288
00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:36.125
Huh?

289
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.708
Nothing. I thought
I saw something.

290
00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:46.500
Should be
close to the target.

291
00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:47.708
Tell me what you see.

292
00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:49.875
There it is.

293
00:19:50.833 --> 00:19:52.500
Our objective plus
four of her core crew.

294
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.583
Toothpick. Tomb Raider.
we're on the X.

295
00:19:55.666 --> 00:19:57.666
Scribblehead. extract
and drop. Let's go.

296
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.458
My name is Knox.

297
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.333
How is it
causing so much interference?

298
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:22.833
Get back on the main road.

299
00:20:27.416 --> 00:20:28.708
You having fun yet?

300
00:20:28.791 --> 00:20:30.250
Just keep your head on a swivel.

301
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:07.625
Everybody down!

302
00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:08.791
Nobody move!

303
00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:09.916
On the ground!

304
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.875
You. got a hearing problem?

305
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.250
On the floor. don't move!

306
00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:14.458
On the ground!

307
00:21:14.541 --> 00:21:16.291
All clear. Lane secure.

308
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.041
Down. down. get down.

309
00:21:20.125 --> 00:21:21.041
You. wanna die?

310
00:21:21.916 --> 00:21:23.291
On the floor! Don't move.

311
00:22:21.458 --> 00:22:22.583
Where
are they going?

312
00:22:29.916 --> 00:22:30.916
Strange…

313
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.708
ShenWei?

314
00:22:40.791 --> 00:22:42.083
Yan. HaiMing?

315
00:22:42.166 --> 00:22:43.166
Does anyone copy?

316
00:22:50.791 --> 00:22:51.791
Gather round!

317
00:22:53.541 --> 00:22:54.541
Hurry up!

318
00:22:57.041 --> 00:22:58.416
Why
isn't anyone answering?

319
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.458
Our comms
went completely down just now.

320
00:23:00.541 --> 00:23:01.791
What
about you guys?

321
00:23:01.875 --> 00:23:03.375
There's
nothing. No signal.

322
00:23:04.333 --> 00:23:05.375
Are
all the buses here?

323
00:23:05.458 --> 00:23:07.125
I saw bus eight leave the
convoy.

324
00:23:07.208 --> 00:23:08.083
Where did it go?

325
00:23:08.166 --> 00:23:08.958
East.

326
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.208
-Where is Yan?
-Bus 11 is gone too.

327
00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:14.541
What's
wrong with you?

328
00:23:14.625 --> 00:23:16.583
You lost two entire
buses in a sandstorm.

329
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.125
That
storm is not natural.

330
00:23:22.541 --> 00:23:24.208
Hurry
up. hurry up. go!

331
00:23:26.041 --> 00:23:27.500
Go. Go.

332
00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:31.041
Hey. these the guys
that armed Area Seven?

333
00:23:31.125 --> 00:23:32.250
-Yeah. why?
-These guys?

334
00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:35.250
What's a criminal
supposed to look like. bro. huh?

335
00:23:35.333 --> 00:23:36.750
You remember Typhoid Mary?

336
00:23:36.833 --> 00:23:38.000
She killed like a 100 people.

337
00:23:38.541 --> 00:23:39.833
Yeah. she was just a cook.

338
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.500
We got it!

339
00:23:45.041 --> 00:23:46.291
Dragon!

340
00:23:47.291 --> 00:23:49.583
Captain Azir. we
lost two buses.

341
00:23:49.666 --> 00:23:51.333
We need both helicopters here.

342
00:23:51.416 --> 00:23:52.666
Copy. Commander.

343
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.208
We are circling back.

344
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:55.291
Okay.

345
00:23:55.833 --> 00:23:57.125
-Take the second helicopter.
-Okay.

346
00:23:57.208 --> 00:23:58.708
-Follow me.
-Where?

347
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:00.083
You're familiar with this
desert.

348
00:24:00.166 --> 00:24:01.916
Isn't this part of your job?

349
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.833
Yeah.

350
00:24:02.916 --> 00:24:04.500
I have surveyed this area
with Professor Cheng before.

351
00:24:04.583 --> 00:24:05.500
Why?

352
00:24:05.583 --> 00:24:07.583
I need your help
finding the missing buses.

353
00:24:07.666 --> 00:24:08.666
I…

354
00:24:11.875 --> 00:24:13.333
Don't worry. I will protect you.

355
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.666
It's breaking up.

356
00:24:47.916 --> 00:24:49.750
This doesn't happen
in the canyons.

357
00:24:49.833 --> 00:24:50.833
Look!

358
00:25:03.041 --> 00:25:03.916
ShenWei.

359
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.583
the sandstorm was man-made.

360
00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:09.625
They used jet engines
to push the sand.

361
00:25:10.375 --> 00:25:11.291
Copy.

362
00:25:11.375 --> 00:25:12.375
Azir.

363
00:25:12.916 --> 00:25:14.041
head north.

364
00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:27.375
Dragon. Dragon!

365
00:25:28.625 --> 00:25:29.375
Dragon!

366
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.250
Can you hear me?

367
00:25:32.375 --> 00:25:34.250
We were ambushed by mercenaries.

368
00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:35.583
Who were they?

369
00:25:35.666 --> 00:25:37.500
Americans.
They were very fast.

370
00:25:38.166 --> 00:25:39.000
Very organized.

371
00:25:39.666 --> 00:25:40.916
You stand down.

372
00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:43.833
Connect with HaiMing.

373
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.416
Copy.

374
00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:52.291
HaiMing.

375
00:25:52.708 --> 00:25:55.041
can you get a GPS
position on bus eight?

376
00:25:56.083 --> 00:25:58.083
GPS
can't locate it.

377
00:25:58.166 --> 00:25:59.166
ShenWei.

378
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.291
scan a 10-mile radius

379
00:26:01.916 --> 00:26:03.833
for any fast-moving vehicles.

380
00:26:03.916 --> 00:26:05.916
Report if you find anything.

381
00:26:06.791 --> 00:26:07.791
Copy.

382
00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:09.875
Circle around.

383
00:26:21.916 --> 00:26:22.875
What's your problem?

384
00:26:22.958 --> 00:26:24.375
I knew I couldn't trust you.

385
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.958
Bro. you are paranoid.

386
00:26:27.541 --> 00:26:29.208
Shit. Incoming!

387
00:26:33.333 --> 00:26:34.333
Cover fire.

388
00:26:35.041 --> 00:26:36.916
Must be them! Go. go. go.

389
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.666
Copy!

390
00:26:52.666 --> 00:26:53.458
Dragon Luo.

391
00:26:53.541 --> 00:26:57.000
there's suspicious mercenaries
and they're firing on us!

392
00:26:58.833 --> 00:27:00.458
Let's go. Head east.

393
00:27:01.666 --> 00:27:02.666
Yan.

394
00:27:03.041 --> 00:27:05.083
join up with the rest of the
team and head to the Green Zone.

395
00:27:05.666 --> 00:27:07.125
I'll meet you there.

396
00:27:07.208 --> 00:27:07.958
Copy.

397
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:09.000
HaiMing.

398
00:27:09.083 --> 00:27:10.333
get the convoy rolling.

399
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.041
Copy.

400
00:27:55.625 --> 00:27:56.708
I just lost my lead.

401
00:27:56.791 --> 00:27:58.208
Etch-a-Sketch. you're up.
you take point.

402
00:27:58.291 --> 00:27:59.333
It's Knox!

403
00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:14.583
Cyclops. push ahead
and set up an ambush.

404
00:28:14.666 --> 00:28:16.166
My name is Knox!

405
00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:25.875
Shit!

406
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.000
He's moving too fast.

407
00:28:37.041 --> 00:28:37.958
Hold on!

408
00:28:42.958 --> 00:28:44.500
Tomb Raider. cover me now.

409
00:28:44.583 --> 00:28:46.333
Tramp Stamp. I'm
drawing this helo away

410
00:28:46.416 --> 00:28:48.041
and you stay behind
and take it out!

411
00:28:54.583 --> 00:28:56.166
We need to keep going.

412
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.250
We got no chance
with that thing in the air.

413
00:29:02.458 --> 00:29:03.791
You take care of the bird.

414
00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:05.333
I'll get 'em to
the exchange site.

415
00:29:05.416 --> 00:29:06.458
Copy!

416
00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:12.583
Set.

417
00:29:17.583 --> 00:29:19.666
Tramp Stamp. take it out.

418
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.250
I'm out.

419
00:29:33.125 --> 00:29:34.458
I'm out.

420
00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:38.208
We're clear.

421
00:29:40.916 --> 00:29:42.708
Goddammit. Knox. take your shot!

422
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.416
I got it.

423
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.416
We're going down.

424
00:30:44.333 --> 00:30:45.333
Commander.

425
00:30:46.916 --> 00:30:47.916
Look.

426
00:30:50.708 --> 00:30:51.916
Go!

427
00:31:04.291 --> 00:31:05.416
You're
going down like this?

428
00:31:06.583 --> 00:31:07.708
Be careful.

429
00:31:45.875 --> 00:31:46.875
Five.

430
00:31:46.958 --> 00:31:47.958
Wei.

431
00:31:48.333 --> 00:31:49.041
Dragon Luo.

432
00:31:49.125 --> 00:31:50.541
they took five people with them.

433
00:31:51.291 --> 00:31:53.166
Azir. five missing.

434
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:54.791
I need Mei down here.

435
00:31:56.083 --> 00:31:57.083
What's going on?

436
00:31:57.833 --> 00:31:58.833
Who hired us?

437
00:31:59.708 --> 00:32:01.250
-Unicorp.
-Don't lie to me. Henry!

438
00:32:01.333 --> 00:32:02.291
What are you mixed up in?

439
00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:04.416
Go easy on him. Chris.

440
00:32:09.541 --> 00:32:10.625
It's like you said.

441
00:32:11.291 --> 00:32:13.041
no one works harder than me.

442
00:32:13.125 --> 00:32:14.250
Owen?

443
00:32:25.875 --> 00:32:26.833
Hey. Mei.

444
00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:28.958
they took Professor Cheng
and her assistant.

445
00:32:29.041 --> 00:32:30.041
What?

446
00:32:37.916 --> 00:32:39.541
Professor Ying Cheng.

447
00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:41.958
Finally.

448
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.583
I'm very. very thankful
you could make it.

449
00:32:46.958 --> 00:32:48.000
Have we met?

450
00:32:48.416 --> 00:32:50.958
No. I'm afraid
I haven't had the pleasure until
now.

451
00:32:51.916 --> 00:32:54.500
I hope my men
didn't cause too many problems
for you.

452
00:32:56.666 --> 00:32:59.083
It was you attacking
our refinery?

453
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:01.833
Please understand. professor.

454
00:33:02.333 --> 00:33:03.583
it's not personal.

455
00:33:04.958 --> 00:33:06.000
Knox!

456
00:33:09.833 --> 00:33:10.791
Let's talk.

457
00:33:13.583 --> 00:33:15.000
I've been all over this country.

458
00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.458
You know what I've found?

459
00:33:22.208 --> 00:33:23.208
This isn't a desert.

460
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:26.000
Everything here is a gold mine.

461
00:33:26.833 --> 00:33:28.708
And I'm wiping the
company out. Chris.

462
00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:30.208
What?

463
00:33:31.833 --> 00:33:34.375
I watched them get rich
while I busted my ass off.

464
00:33:35.583 --> 00:33:37.666
Sixteen years of false promises.

465
00:33:40.708 --> 00:33:42.458
I even gave up having
a family for them.

466
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:44.750
And for what?

467
00:33:46.291 --> 00:33:47.291
Nothing.

468
00:33:49.083 --> 00:33:50.166
But now it's my turn.

469
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.541
I'm taking this war private.

470
00:33:53.625 --> 00:33:55.083
I'm taking back
what they owe me.

471
00:33:55.625 --> 00:33:56.625
What they owe us.

472
00:33:56.708 --> 00:33:58.625
Listen. Owen. what you got
going on here that's your
business.

473
00:33:59.208 --> 00:34:00.458
It's between you and her.

474
00:34:01.583 --> 00:34:02.583
Hm.

475
00:34:04.291 --> 00:34:06.958
Dragon Luo is leading
the Chinese security team.

476
00:34:08.083 --> 00:34:09.875
He's gonna come
after the professor.

477
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:13.583
If you can keep him off my tail.
I can make you rich.

478
00:34:13.666 --> 00:34:15.291
Not interested.
I just want my money.

479
00:34:15.375 --> 00:34:16.375
When the job is done.

480
00:34:16.458 --> 00:34:18.250
The job is done.
Henry said dropping--

481
00:34:18.333 --> 00:34:19.833
Henry's young and desperate!

482
00:34:22.291 --> 00:34:25.041
You can't trust people
who are desperate.

483
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.541
It's our time.

484
00:34:34.291 --> 00:34:36.416
You don't want to pass
this up. my friend.

485
00:34:36.875 --> 00:34:38.000
And remember.

486
00:34:38.958 --> 00:34:39.958
no money.

487
00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:41.333
no water.

488
00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:43.541
Selfish son of a bitch.

489
00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:45.250
I'm selfish?

490
00:34:49.708 --> 00:34:51.291
You know what selfish is?

491
00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:53.208
Staying here and hiding.

492
00:34:56.125 --> 00:34:57.083
I'm done with you.

493
00:34:57.166 --> 00:34:58.083
Whatever you want.

494
00:34:58.666 --> 00:35:00.625
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
you're just gonna let him walk?

495
00:35:00.708 --> 00:35:01.708
He's your brother.

496
00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:03.333
You stop him.

497
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:06.083
Chris. wait.

498
00:35:06.708 --> 00:35:08.708
I-I need to collect our money
and we gotta finish.

499
00:35:08.791 --> 00:35:10.125
Get out of here
while you still can.

500
00:35:12.166 --> 00:35:13.250
Well. go on then.

501
00:35:13.958 --> 00:35:14.791
Quit.

502
00:35:16.416 --> 00:35:18.708
Just like you did
when you bailed on our old man.

503
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.041
Be at the village
at 1600 sharp.

504
00:35:22.125 --> 00:35:24.333
Bring the rest of my money
and don't be late.

505
00:35:32.291 --> 00:35:33.291
Owen.

506
00:35:33.916 --> 00:35:34.791
We don't need him.

507
00:35:35.875 --> 00:35:38.125
I can handle this
Dragon Luo guy on my own.

508
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:40.750
You failed. Henry.

509
00:35:40.833 --> 00:35:42.375
That makes me so sad.

510
00:35:54.291 --> 00:35:55.166
Stop!

511
00:35:56.166 --> 00:35:57.208
We need the hostages.

512
00:35:59.541 --> 00:36:00.541
Idiot.

513
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:11.041
Take him back to the radio tower

514
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:13.333
and make it look like
Chinese payback. okay?

515
00:36:13.416 --> 00:36:16.125
Also. close the loop
on Henry's bullshit with the
French.

516
00:36:16.208 --> 00:36:18.166
We can't have them
interfering with the plan.

517
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:19.583
Let's go!

518
00:36:30.708 --> 00:36:31.708
Hey.

519
00:36:34.416 --> 00:36:35.416
Follow that car.

520
00:36:36.166 --> 00:36:36.958
Copy. sir.

521
00:37:10.875 --> 00:37:11.750
What's up ahead?

522
00:37:11.833 --> 00:37:12.666
I don't know.

523
00:37:13.458 --> 00:37:15.708
There's a village there in Area
Four.

524
00:37:15.791 --> 00:37:16.791
But it's dangerous.

525
00:37:18.208 --> 00:37:19.458
Follow him.

526
00:37:20.583 --> 00:37:22.250
We're low on fuel.

527
00:37:22.875 --> 00:37:24.291
I can make it. but that's it.

528
00:37:26.166 --> 00:37:28.458
You stay in the helicopter.
okay?

529
00:38:02.625 --> 00:38:03.875
Chris. we play.

530
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:17.875
Almost. bud. almost.

531
00:38:26.583 --> 00:38:27.750
Come on. Henry.

532
00:38:30.583 --> 00:38:31.875
That took a bad
hop. took a bad hop.

533
00:38:31.958 --> 00:38:32.875
Oh!

534
00:38:51.708 --> 00:38:52.541
You lost?

535
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:57.916
I come for my people.

536
00:39:01.583 --> 00:39:03.000
What are you doing
in my village?

537
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.333
What are you doing
in the desert?

538
00:39:09.125 --> 00:39:09.958
I'm fishing.

539
00:39:10.833 --> 00:39:12.166
What are you doing
in the desert?

540
00:39:17.916 --> 00:39:18.916
Hello?

541
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:20.750
I'm fine.

542
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
I'm playing baseball
with a bangchui.

543
00:39:29.791 --> 00:39:31.125
I came for my people.

544
00:39:32.416 --> 00:39:34.000
You got the wrong guy.

545
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.125
Chris. we play.

546
00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.083
Whoa.

547
00:40:12.166 --> 00:40:13.958
You caught it. Funhouse.
That was awesome.

548
00:40:14.791 --> 00:40:17.458
I told you many times to behave
yourself.

549
00:40:17.541 --> 00:40:19.125
You will get punished next time.

550
00:40:20.583 --> 00:40:21.833
Chris.
where are you going?

551
00:40:21.916 --> 00:40:23.750
I'm going to get our money.
I won't be long.

552
00:40:23.833 --> 00:40:24.666
Okay.

553
00:41:08.541 --> 00:41:09.458
Yo!

554
00:41:58.791 --> 00:42:00.458
See you on the other side. bro.

555
00:43:24.416 --> 00:43:25.625
Why are you following me?

556
00:43:26.416 --> 00:43:27.708
Why are you in the desert?

557
00:43:38.333 --> 00:43:39.583
Oh! Ah!

558
00:43:57.958 --> 00:43:58.750
Ah.

559
00:44:09.375 --> 00:44:09.958
Ah!

560
00:44:26.041 --> 00:44:27.041
You killed my people.

561
00:44:27.125 --> 00:44:29.291
Ahh. I didn't kill anyone.

562
00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:30.583
Yes. you did.

563
00:44:31.208 --> 00:44:32.291
Oh!

564
00:44:40.833 --> 00:44:41.583
Ow!

565
00:44:43.166 --> 00:44:44.208
Uh!

566
00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:55.208
I know it's you.

567
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:56.375
How?

568
00:44:56.666 --> 00:44:57.833
Fishing in the desert?

569
00:44:58.333 --> 00:44:59.375
Really?

570
00:45:15.416 --> 00:45:16.500
Listen to me.

571
00:45:19.375 --> 00:45:20.833
Listen to me.

572
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:23.458
You killed my people.

573
00:45:23.541 --> 00:45:26.125
They killed your people.
They killed my brother too.

574
00:45:29.916 --> 00:45:31.500
What's
going on here?

575
00:45:31.583 --> 00:45:32.333
Where is my money?

576
00:45:33.875 --> 00:45:34.875
Hello.

577
00:45:35.083 --> 00:45:36.083
You speak French?

578
00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.166
That's all.

579
00:45:37.541 --> 00:45:39.791
Where is my money. Mr. America?

580
00:45:39.875 --> 00:45:40.708
For the weapons.

581
00:45:40.791 --> 00:45:41.791
Looking for money?

582
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:43.791
Get in line.

583
00:45:54.583 --> 00:45:56.375
Hurry up.
I think they're gonna shoot you.

584
00:45:56.458 --> 00:45:57.291
Why?

585
00:45:57.375 --> 00:45:58.916
Because the first
time I see you.

586
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.166
I wanted to shoot you.

587
00:46:06.083 --> 00:46:07.375
Start shooting!

588
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:09.791
See?

589
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:13.250
Go!

590
00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:22.958
Shit-shit-shit-shit!

591
00:46:23.666 --> 00:46:24.875
-Magazine!
-What?!

592
00:46:24.958 --> 00:46:26.083
Magazine!

593
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:27.375
Here!

594
00:46:29.833 --> 00:46:31.583
Hey! Bullets?

595
00:46:31.666 --> 00:46:33.166
What kind of bullets?

596
00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:34.458
Seven six two.

597
00:46:35.208 --> 00:46:36.208
Seven six two.

598
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.041
Seven six two. Seven six two.

599
00:46:39.125 --> 00:46:41.291
-What are you doing?
-I'm loading for you!

600
00:46:41.375 --> 00:46:42.625
Just give 'em to me!

601
00:46:43.916 --> 00:46:44.750
Ah.

602
00:46:44.833 --> 00:46:45.666
Here!

603
00:46:47.916 --> 00:46:49.000
Hey!

604
00:46:49.083 --> 00:46:50.125
-What?
-Forget it!

605
00:46:50.208 --> 00:46:51.041
Grenade!

606
00:46:53.208 --> 00:46:54.708
Give me a grenade!

607
00:46:54.791 --> 00:46:55.708
Yeah. grenade.

608
00:46:55.791 --> 00:46:56.791
You get it!

609
00:46:56.875 --> 00:46:58.000
What are you. crazy?

610
00:46:58.083 --> 00:46:59.041
What?

611
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.916
Too dangerous.

612
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:01.750
You're closer.

613
00:47:01.833 --> 00:47:02.541
Me go?

614
00:47:02.625 --> 00:47:03.541
Go!

615
00:47:03.625 --> 00:47:04.625
Shit. shit.

616
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:11.333
Here we go. come
on. come on. come on!

617
00:47:11.416 --> 00:47:12.875
Who killed my people?

618
00:47:13.416 --> 00:47:14.250
What?

619
00:47:15.041 --> 00:47:16.041
Come on.

620
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:18.541
Who are they?

621
00:47:18.625 --> 00:47:20.625
-It wasn't them.
-What?

622
00:47:20.708 --> 00:47:21.708
Come on.

623
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:24.791
Hurry up. grenade!

624
00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:26.208
I gotta find it!

625
00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:27.125
It's in the bin.

626
00:47:27.875 --> 00:47:29.000
What?

627
00:47:29.083 --> 00:47:30.000
In the bin.

628
00:47:30.083 --> 00:47:31.125
Pull the pin?

629
00:47:32.125 --> 00:47:33.875
Okay. here!

630
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Huh?

631
00:47:39.833 --> 00:47:41.125
Why'd you pull the pin. man?

632
00:47:41.208 --> 00:47:42.583
-Pull the pin?
-I said "the bin."

633
00:47:42.666 --> 00:47:44.375
I pulled the pin already.

634
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.541
Wait-wait-wait-wait.

635
00:47:48.625 --> 00:47:49.916
What?!

636
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:51.958
I think they're gone.

637
00:47:53.375 --> 00:47:54.333
How do you know?

638
00:47:55.125 --> 00:47:56.416
No more shooting.

639
00:47:59.125 --> 00:48:00.250
Take a look.

640
00:48:01.083 --> 00:48:02.041
You look.

641
00:48:02.125 --> 00:48:03.333
-You.
-You look!

642
00:48:03.416 --> 00:48:04.958
You closer.

643
00:48:09.375 --> 00:48:10.416
Yeah. I think they're gone.

644
00:48:11.583 --> 00:48:12.958
Don't look one direction.

645
00:48:28.541 --> 00:48:30.083
Who killed my people?

646
00:48:30.166 --> 00:48:31.500
You ever give up?

647
00:48:32.416 --> 00:48:33.333
No. Who are they?

648
00:48:35.125 --> 00:48:36.125
You shoot me.

649
00:48:36.458 --> 00:48:37.458
you're never gonna find out.

650
00:48:38.333 --> 00:48:39.333
Gotta go check on my truck.

651
00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:40.875
Hey.

652
00:48:58.166 --> 00:48:59.166
Oh.

653
00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:03.875
You have flat tire.

654
00:49:05.875 --> 00:49:06.625
Ethel.

655
00:49:10.791 --> 00:49:12.000
Your car has a name?

656
00:49:12.083 --> 00:49:13.083
Yeah.

657
00:49:14.666 --> 00:49:15.875
Is that weird?

658
00:49:16.541 --> 00:49:17.750
Come on.

659
00:49:17.833 --> 00:49:19.458
-Can't leave the weapons.
-Or the bodies.

660
00:49:23.375 --> 00:49:24.375
It's weird.

661
00:49:27.958 --> 00:49:29.625
Owen Paddock
runs everything for Unicorp.

662
00:49:29.708 --> 00:49:30.833
He's got your people.

663
00:49:30.916 --> 00:49:32.250
Which company? This company?

664
00:49:32.333 --> 00:49:33.458
No. that one.

665
00:49:33.541 --> 00:49:34.333
Get in the car.

666
00:49:34.416 --> 00:49:36.125
Hey. no time! Come
on. come on. come on.

667
00:49:36.708 --> 00:49:38.500
Hey. where's he taken them?

668
00:49:38.583 --> 00:49:39.625
I don't know.

669
00:49:39.708 --> 00:49:41.750
But it's too dangerous
to do anything here at night.

670
00:49:41.833 --> 00:49:42.541
Even for you.

671
00:49:56.125 --> 00:49:57.125
By the way.

672
00:49:57.416 --> 00:49:58.416
what's your name?

673
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:03.708
It's bangchui. isn't it?

674
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:05.750
Huh?

675
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.083
You
can speak Chinese?

676
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.291
Yes. I can.

677
00:50:15.541 --> 00:50:16.541
Let go!

678
00:50:19.125 --> 00:50:20.208
Where you learn Chinese?

679
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:22.750
I was in Shanghai
working for a dead man company.

680
00:50:22.833 --> 00:50:23.708
What?

681
00:50:23.791 --> 00:50:25.416
A
dead man company.

682
00:50:26.666 --> 00:50:28.208
Dead man company?

683
00:50:28.666 --> 00:50:30.250
Yes. private security.

684
00:50:31.875 --> 00:50:34.208
It's pronounced
private security company.

685
00:50:34.291 --> 00:50:36.833
Not "funeral parlor".

686
00:50:37.916 --> 00:50:40.500
Private security company.
First tone. not third tone.

687
00:50:41.416 --> 00:50:43.083
Private
security company.

688
00:50:43.166 --> 00:50:44.500
Private
security company.

689
00:50:44.583 --> 00:50:45.875
You speak English!

690
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.250
The refinery
is protected by quantum encryption.

691
00:50:59.958 --> 00:51:02.833
It's not happening
without the dongle.

692
00:51:08.166 --> 00:51:09.291
All right. professor.

693
00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:11.500
I need you to get
the oil flowing.

694
00:51:13.333 --> 00:51:14.250
Where's the dongle?

695
00:51:15.083 --> 00:51:16.750
You're gonna steal our oil.

696
00:51:32.541 --> 00:51:35.958
Some of my men. my…
friends have died

697
00:51:36.041 --> 00:51:38.875
and their families.
they didn't get anything. so…

698
00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:42.958
I'm just taking back
what they owe us.

699
00:51:44.041 --> 00:51:45.083
You're gonna help me.

700
00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.333
You're stealing.

701
00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:53.125
I think everyone
is stealing from this country.

702
00:51:53.208 --> 00:51:54.250
We buy it.

703
00:51:55.916 --> 00:51:57.458
I also need the codes. please.

704
00:52:02.125 --> 00:52:04.250
It's a very complex process

705
00:52:05.458 --> 00:52:06.125
and there's not--

706
00:52:10.333 --> 00:52:11.625
Please continue.

707
00:52:19.583 --> 00:52:20.416
Paper.

708
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.708
Yeah. with the codes. right?

709
00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:23.791
Yes.

710
00:52:23.875 --> 00:52:25.166
And the dongle?

711
00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:28.166
Dongle.

712
00:52:32.208 --> 00:52:33.083
Dongle.

713
00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:34.000
Where are they?

714
00:52:57.958 --> 00:53:00.041
Why would I kill you
when I can kill your son?

715
00:53:02.791 --> 00:53:04.083
No!

716
00:53:04.166 --> 00:53:05.250
No!

717
00:53:05.333 --> 00:53:06.666
Everything in my bag.

718
00:53:07.125 --> 00:53:08.083
Where's the bag?

719
00:53:08.166 --> 00:53:09.250
No. I don't know where is it!

720
00:53:09.333 --> 00:53:10.208
Where's the bag?

721
00:53:10.291 --> 00:53:11.916
It's not with me right now.

722
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.708
I don't know where is it!
No. please. please!

723
00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:17.083
No. please trust me--

724
00:53:17.166 --> 00:53:18.250
I'm so sorry.

725
00:53:18.333 --> 00:53:19.500
It's not with me.

726
00:53:19.583 --> 00:53:20.416
Track her phone!

727
00:53:26.333 --> 00:53:27.458
Her phone.

728
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:28.625
It's in her bag.

729
00:53:32.041 --> 00:53:32.916
Pho--

730
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:37.541
Go get the bag.

731
00:53:45.666 --> 00:53:46.666
Hello?

732
00:53:47.583 --> 00:53:49.875
Big dog!

733
00:53:49.958 --> 00:53:53.750
That's right. the big dog is
back and performing his brand
new hit single.

734
00:53:53.833 --> 00:53:54.875
Hello?

735
00:53:54.958 --> 00:53:57.791

That's a-a-a different bulldog?

789
00:56:02.291 --> 00:56:04.125
-Young bulldog.
-A younger bulldog.

790
00:56:04.208 --> 00:56:05.125
What is that?

791
00:56:06.666 --> 00:56:08.291
It looks like you're
hanging from a wire.

792
00:56:08.375 --> 00:56:10.750
Let me guess:
you're suspended from a
building.

793
00:56:10.833 --> 00:56:12.166
Giraffe.

794
00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:14.291
-A giraffe?
-Yeah. what's-what's that?

795
00:56:14.916 --> 00:56:16.666
You-you look like a statue.

796
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.166
No. human. Just me.

797
00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:20.416
Oh. that's pretty good.
'cause I mean that was real.

798
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.208
That was good--
You were actually a human being.

799
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:23.583
He's good. He's got a good bit.

800
00:56:24.833 --> 00:56:26.333
Time for the meal.

801
00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:27.291
-Good work.
-Yeah. Yeah.

802
00:56:27.375 --> 00:56:28.750
-Excellent.
-You do it every day?

803
00:56:28.833 --> 00:56:30.041
Every day.

804
00:56:30.125 --> 00:56:31.875
Let's let the kids eat.

805
00:56:33.083 --> 00:56:34.041
See ya.

806
00:56:34.125 --> 00:56:35.458
Big dog. big dog.

807
00:56:35.541 --> 00:56:36.541
Yes.

808
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:45.291
Oh.

809
00:56:46.708 --> 00:56:47.708
Thank you.

810
00:56:56.875 --> 00:56:58.083
Why take two buses?

811
00:56:59.041 --> 00:57:00.333
You only needed bus eight.

812
00:57:00.916 --> 00:57:01.750
Distraction.

813
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:05.500
Hey. man. your friend
dropped her book.

814
00:57:06.125 --> 00:57:09.625
I'm no idiot. I don't see
any chemistry there between you
two

815
00:57:09.708 --> 00:57:11.875
so I figured I
would use the book

816
00:57:11.958 --> 00:57:13.250
as like an in. you know.

817
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:15.208
I mean. I put my number in the
back or something. 'cause I
mean.

818
00:57:16.416 --> 00:57:17.416
look at her. man.

819
00:57:18.125 --> 00:57:19.083
She is hot.

820
00:57:20.416 --> 00:57:21.416
That booty.

821
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.375
I mean. I'm no freak
kind of guy but--

822
00:57:25.541 --> 00:57:26.625
She's my daughter.

823
00:57:27.208 --> 00:57:28.208
Huh…

824
00:57:30.833 --> 00:57:32.291
Uh. of course she is. I--

825
00:57:32.875 --> 00:57:34.708
You-- Now that you
mention it. she--

826
00:57:35.375 --> 00:57:36.541
she looks just like you.

827
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.208
She is your daughter.

828
00:57:39.291 --> 00:57:40.458
How did I not see that?

829
00:57:49.166 --> 00:57:50.166
Mei and I.

830
00:57:50.791 --> 00:57:51.791
complicated.

831
00:57:53.833 --> 00:57:54.916
Her mother died.

832
00:57:56.291 --> 00:57:57.750
For Mei. maybe I'm dead. too.

833
00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.958
Wait. you said
you never give up.

834
00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:03.250
In war. yes.

835
00:58:03.875 --> 00:58:05.500
In life. not so easy.

836
00:58:09.375 --> 00:58:10.375
Why are you here?

837
00:58:11.583 --> 00:58:12.583
Yeah.

838
00:58:14.083 --> 00:58:15.541
Me and my brother used
to work for my dad.

839
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.416
Private contractors?

840
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:19.708
Yeah. Damn good too.

841
00:58:20.291 --> 00:58:21.708
Every one of us. Special Ops.

842
00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:24.625
Two years ago. my old man got a
job on the Highway of Death.

843
00:58:25.291 --> 00:58:26.541
Turned it down.

844
00:58:26.625 --> 00:58:28.083
First time I ever
heard him say it.

845
00:58:29.333 --> 00:58:30.875
So I convinced him to take it.

846
00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:35.125
And we… drove right
into a rebel ambush.

847
00:58:35.208 --> 00:58:36.541
Forty-eight hour firefight.

848
00:58:36.625 --> 00:58:39.791
In the end. I…
hatched up a plan to get us out
of there.

849
00:58:39.875 --> 00:58:41.458
I-I-I needed to hold the line

850
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.041
so my dad could move.

851
00:58:43.791 --> 00:58:45.916
But I signaled to him
that I needed to move.

852
00:58:47.375 --> 00:58:49.833
And we both moved
at the same time.

853
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:52.000
And everybody got wasted.

854
00:58:52.708 --> 00:58:54.291
My dad got killed
right there in front of me.

855
00:58:57.416 --> 00:58:58.583
Your father and your men.

856
00:58:58.666 --> 00:59:00.750
they died because
it was their time.

857
00:59:02.208 --> 00:59:03.750
This is the life we choose.

858
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.125
Don't look for reasons why.

859
00:59:06.208 --> 00:59:07.666
Yeah. before. man. we…

860
00:59:08.833 --> 00:59:10.958
fought for honor or
a flag or something.

861
00:59:12.708 --> 00:59:14.125
I fight for my family.

862
00:59:14.791 --> 00:59:17.500
my people. my
country. That's all.

863
00:59:18.416 --> 00:59:19.750
They were my family.

864
00:59:19.833 --> 00:59:21.666
The village is your family now.

865
00:59:28.541 --> 00:59:30.666
By the way. what's
your real name?

866
00:59:31.291 --> 00:59:32.625
It's not bangchui.

867
00:59:35.416 --> 00:59:36.416
It's Chris.

868
00:59:45.125 --> 00:59:46.125
Sh!

869
00:59:50.083 --> 00:59:51.750
Get the kids in
the classroom. now.

870
00:59:51.833 --> 00:59:52.458
Okay.

871
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:55.625
Go. go. go!

872
00:59:55.708 --> 00:59:56.958
Come on. come on. hurry.

873
01:00:04.916 --> 01:00:06.250
You go high. I'll go low.

874
01:00:06.333 --> 01:00:07.166
Okay.

875
01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:02.791
-Where is it?
-Where's what?

876
01:01:04.291 --> 01:01:05.500
Hey!

877
01:01:14.875 --> 01:01:16.625
I'm okay. You okay?

878
01:01:16.708 --> 01:01:18.750
-Get off me.
-Okay.

879
01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:24.875
Did you say. "I go
high. you go low?"

880
01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:26.416
I did go low.

881
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.500
Then I went high.

882
01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:30.541
Okay. from now on.
no more talking.

883
01:01:30.625 --> 01:01:31.625
Hand signal.

884
01:01:33.375 --> 01:01:34.500
You know hand signal. right?

885
01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:43.333
Shit.

886
01:02:05.166 --> 01:02:06.041
Good signal. huh?

887
01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:10.458
Hey.

888
01:02:14.291 --> 01:02:15.750
Six. six.

889
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.875
Six o'clock!

890
01:02:20.916 --> 01:02:21.875
Can't you read the signal?

891
01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:23.083
What signal?

892
01:02:23.166 --> 01:02:24.083
Let's go.

893
01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:30.791
Don't you know what this means?

894
01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:33.750
Yeah. call you. have a beer.
relax. What do you mean?

895
01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.041
One. two. three. four. five.
six. six o'clock.

896
01:02:36.125 --> 01:02:39.083
How does that mean six?
Just say. "Behind you."

897
01:02:40.083 --> 01:02:41.958
This time you go
high. I go low.

898
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:43.916
Go!

899
01:02:44.666 --> 01:02:45.750
Remember. bangchui.

900
01:02:57.458 --> 01:02:58.541
Shit! Ah!

901
01:03:52.083 --> 01:03:53.083
Chris!

902
01:03:57.416 --> 01:03:58.416
Give me your phone.

903
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:00.291
The phone! Gimme the phone!

904
01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:11.291
Hey. you looking for this?

905
01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:42.458
Looks like we got ourselves
an old-fashioned standoff.

906
01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:44.791
Look. here's your
tracking device

907
01:04:44.875 --> 01:04:47.416
but you don't know where the
girl is and you're not gonna
find her.

908
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.708
I'm only here for the bag.

909
01:04:58.791 --> 01:04:59.833
The bag?

910
01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:04.125
Hey. where are you going?

911
01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:07.166
Ah. no. no!

912
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:08.166
What are you doing?

913
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Chris!

914
01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:29.541
Hey.

915
01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:30.916
What are you doing?

916
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.291
This is my family!

917
01:05:32.375 --> 01:05:34.375
I protect this village!

918
01:05:34.458 --> 01:05:35.833
If they want that bag.

919
01:05:35.916 --> 01:05:37.416
I'll just give them that bag.

920
01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.708
You speak--

921
01:05:38.791 --> 01:05:40.041
You
can speak Chinese?

922
01:05:40.125 --> 01:05:41.708
Yes. that's how
mad I am right now.

923
01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:53.000
What's so important
about that bag anyway?

924
01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:55.791
The bag has the USB
key and the passwords

925
01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:57.958
to open the flow
from the refinery.

926
01:05:58.458 --> 01:05:59.583
How much oil?

927
01:06:00.166 --> 01:06:01.333
Millions of barrels.

928
01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:02.708
Yeah. who cares?

929
01:06:02.791 --> 01:06:06.583
To get that much oil out of the
refinery they'd need like… 500
trucks

930
01:06:06.666 --> 01:06:08.208
and then they gotta
drive it to the coast.

931
01:06:08.291 --> 01:06:09.625
There is an underground network

932
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:12.208
that flows across the country.

933
01:06:12.291 --> 01:06:13.833
That's what those
pipes are for?

934
01:06:16.666 --> 01:06:17.666
They use the pipes

935
01:06:18.666 --> 01:06:19.750
and fill tankers.

936
01:06:20.416 --> 01:06:23.000
Each tanker holds a 100 million
in oil. That would make it--

937
01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:25.750
The biggest oil
heist in history.

938
01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:27.333
We gotta get to the refinery.

939
01:06:28.083 --> 01:06:30.708
But we need something
that can drive through the gate.

940
01:06:31.708 --> 01:06:32.708
I got something.

941
01:06:34.708 --> 01:06:35.958
You in position yet?

942
01:06:36.041 --> 01:06:38.083
We're on the
station. Standing by.

943
01:06:38.166 --> 01:06:39.166
Copy.

944
01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:41.500
Gentlemen.
prepare to dock.

945
01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:46.250
I'm coming too!

946
01:06:46.333 --> 01:06:48.083
I know the refinery
better than you do.

947
01:06:48.166 --> 01:06:49.208
I can help you guys.

948
01:06:50.041 --> 01:06:51.416
It's
dangerous there.

949
01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.833
You should wait here.

950
01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:00.041
I promise. I'll
come back for you.

951
01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:02.583
Fine.

952
01:07:02.666 --> 01:07:03.708
Be careful.

953
01:07:06.625 --> 01:07:07.958
The refinery is very flammable.

954
01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:09.125
Don't use guns.

955
01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:12.083
You have to remember
never to use guns.

956
01:07:12.166 --> 01:07:13.166
Okay.

957
01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:16.958
-Take it s--
-Shut up.

958
01:07:17.041 --> 01:07:18.958
Okay. you're
right. you're right.

959
01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:26.708
Hey. put your seat belt on.

960
01:07:27.583 --> 01:07:28.791
Safety first.

961
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.333
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

962
01:07:41.583 --> 01:07:43.416
Slow

963
01:07:44.166 --> 01:07:45.833
and put in the hole.

964
01:07:49.041 --> 01:07:50.916
Yeah. see? So easy.

965
01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:53.833
You happy?

966
01:07:54.416 --> 01:07:55.416
Happy.

967
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.375
We can go.

968
01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:57.458
Let's go.

969
01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:45.291
Get working.

970
01:08:47.708 --> 01:08:48.666
Now.

971
01:09:00.083 --> 01:09:01.541
Fingerprint. please.

972
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.500
And passcode.

973
01:09:13.375 --> 01:09:14.375
Seven. nine.

974
01:09:15.458 --> 01:09:16.416
four. two.

975
01:09:27.041 --> 01:09:29.333
I hear it turning
on. Start filling!

976
01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:34.333
It's flowing.

977
01:09:35.125 --> 01:09:36.125
We're a go.

978
01:09:53.083 --> 01:09:54.875
It'll take 24 hours.

979
01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:55.958
I know.

980
01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:57.708
I'm not an idiot.

981
01:09:59.208 --> 01:10:02.000
Let's fill the trucks. Get
moving. -They're being filled.

982
01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:04.208
Once we cross into
the demilitarized zone

983
01:10:04.291 --> 01:10:05.250
they can't touch us.

984
01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:16.625
Enemy approaching!
Enemy approaching!

985
01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:18.208
Fire!

986
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:29.000
Hey!

987
01:11:00.125 --> 01:11:01.333
Oil truck!

988
01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:26.583
Follow me.

989
01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:52.541
Ah.

990
01:11:59.333 --> 01:12:01.416
Sorry. See?

991
01:12:10.041 --> 01:12:11.458
What are you doing?

992
01:12:11.541 --> 01:12:12.958
So they can't stop it.

993
01:12:13.041 --> 01:12:14.125
We're rolling out.

994
01:12:15.833 --> 01:12:17.708
You stay here and
watch the hostages.

995
01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:20.166
But kill them once
the tankers are full.

996
01:12:49.541 --> 01:12:50.708
Jump!

997
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:51.875
I can't jump.

998
01:12:53.958 --> 01:12:55.125
Hold on!

999
01:12:57.166 --> 01:12:58.375
Whoo!

1000
01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:00.708
Thank you.

1001
01:13:04.083 --> 01:13:05.000
Yah!

1002
01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:08.625
Dragon Luo!

1003
01:13:11.291 --> 01:13:12.791
It's an honor to meet you.

1004
01:13:14.833 --> 01:13:16.708
It's a shame you have to do this
on your own.

1005
01:13:17.833 --> 01:13:18.916
I'm not alone.

1006
01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:39.791
Oh!

1007
01:13:42.291 --> 01:13:43.416
-There's a--
-Huh?

1008
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.000
-Few more. You'll be fine.
-What?

1009
01:13:45.083 --> 01:13:46.666
Come up when you're done.

1010
01:14:05.125 --> 01:14:06.000
Help them.

1011
01:14:10.416 --> 01:14:11.416
Ah!

1012
01:14:52.833 --> 01:14:53.875
I got Skullface.

1013
01:14:53.958 --> 01:14:55.500
All right.

1014
01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:57.583
Professor. let's go!

1015
01:15:00.875 --> 01:15:02.166
Hurry up!

1016
01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:30.541
Hey. magazine.

1017
01:15:30.625 --> 01:15:32.041
Magazine. Catch!

1018
01:15:33.708 --> 01:15:35.041
Really?

1019
01:15:37.791 --> 01:15:38.583
Come on.

1020
01:15:40.583 --> 01:15:41.583
Clear.

1021
01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:27.583
Hey. Knox.

1022
01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:29.875
I've been racking my
brain this whole time

1023
01:16:29.958 --> 01:16:32.333
to try to think of
a perfect nickname for you.

1024
01:16:32.416 --> 01:16:33.666
Sharpie Head or

1025
01:16:34.291 --> 01:16:35.791
One-Eyed Trouser Snake

1026
01:16:36.416 --> 01:16:37.541
Daddy Issues…

1027
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:40.708
But I just figured out

1028
01:16:40.791 --> 01:16:42.125
right now

1029
01:16:43.458 --> 01:16:45.708
the perfect nickname for you.

1030
01:16:48.541 --> 01:16:49.625
Dead Man.

1031
01:16:50.625 --> 01:16:52.541
You know why?

1032
01:16:52.625 --> 01:16:53.625
'Cause you out of bullets.

1033
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
You go. I got this.

1034
01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:12.000
-You sure?
-Sure!

1035
01:17:12.791 --> 01:17:13.875
All right.

1036
01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:15.583
Hey!

1037
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.291
Everyone head out to the DMZ.

1038
01:17:29.916 --> 01:17:31.125
Let's go.

1039
01:17:58.458 --> 01:17:59.458
That settles it.

1040
01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:02.333
More cardio starting Monday.

1041
01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:03.958
Ah…

1042
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.041
Susie?

1043
01:18:10.958 --> 01:18:12.083
That's my truck.

1044
01:18:17.333 --> 01:18:18.625
I'm gonna kill him.

1045
01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:21.208
I swear I'm gonna kill him.
I don't want to…

1046
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:24.583
Mei?

1047
01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:25.791
Where's my father?

1048
01:18:25.875 --> 01:18:27.083
Why are you driving Susie?

1049
01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:29.083
Who?

1050
01:18:29.166 --> 01:18:30.208
Stay in the car.

1051
01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:33.750
Let's go.

1052
01:18:40.833 --> 01:18:41.708
Sorry.

1053
01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:45.666
Drive.

1054
01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.500
You keep a machine
gun under the seat?

1055
01:19:03.625 --> 01:19:04.625
American.

1056
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.500
Guns everywhere.

1057
01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:17.041
Professor. leave now.

1058
01:19:41.708 --> 01:19:42.916
Easy. easy.

1059
01:19:43.625 --> 01:19:44.791
Oh!

1060
01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:46.166
There goes the new clutch.

1061
01:19:46.833 --> 01:19:48.291
Shift. Shift.

1062
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Yes. I'm trying. but

1063
01:19:51.833 --> 01:19:53.375
the transmission is loose.

1064
01:19:54.166 --> 01:19:55.166
Loose?

1065
01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:57.500
Don't listen to her. Susie.

1066
01:19:57.583 --> 01:19:58.875
Hold on.

1067
01:20:08.666 --> 01:20:09.916
Oh!

1068
01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:34.083
Contact. six o'clock.

1069
01:20:42.416 --> 01:20:44.083
How do you work these?

1070
01:20:53.416 --> 01:20:54.541
Start swerving.

1071
01:21:00.958 --> 01:21:02.625
Oh. Chris.

1072
01:21:20.416 --> 01:21:21.500
Ah!

1073
01:21:32.333 --> 01:21:33.250
Yah!

1074
01:21:36.333 --> 01:21:37.541
Hyah!

1075
01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:38.625
Ooh!

1076
01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:55.416
Oh.

1077
01:21:59.791 --> 01:22:00.708
Yah!

1078
01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:06.666
Yah!

1079
01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:08.375
Aah!

1080
01:22:16.958 --> 01:22:18.083
Shit!

1081
01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:19.791
Aw. come on.

1082
01:22:19.875 --> 01:22:20.916
We're out of bullets.

1083
01:22:25.166 --> 01:22:26.500
They're out.

1084
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:29.708
Take her off the road. now!

1085
01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:33.750
Let's see if she's
ready now. Chris.

1086
01:22:38.458 --> 01:22:40.000
Follow them. She can handle it.

1087
01:22:40.083 --> 01:22:41.208
Okay.

1088
01:23:05.958 --> 01:23:06.833
Ah!

1089
01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:13.375
Hm?

1090
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Ah!

1091
01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:25.000
Hey. hey. hey!

1092
01:23:37.875 --> 01:23:39.416
Faster. Go. go. go. go. go. go.

1093
01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:43.500
They're still
behind us. Faster!

1094
01:23:47.125 --> 01:23:48.541
Your nickname shouldn't be "Dead
Man."

1095
01:23:48.625 --> 01:23:49.958
You look more like a

1096
01:23:50.041 --> 01:23:51.666
frozen Peking duck.

1097
01:23:55.458 --> 01:23:57.291
Professor? Professor?

1098
01:23:58.541 --> 01:23:59.375
Professor?

1099
01:23:59.833 --> 01:24:00.666
Professor?

1100
01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:05.000
They broke the
dongle and I can't shut the
refinery down.

1101
01:24:05.083 --> 01:24:06.791
It's all up to you now.

1102
01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:08.333
Stay here.

1103
01:24:08.416 --> 01:24:10.000
I will be back right away.

1104
01:24:29.291 --> 01:24:30.333
Come on.

1105
01:24:32.583 --> 01:24:33.583
Go!

1106
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:36.458
Go.

1107
01:24:36.541 --> 01:24:37.375
No. no. no. no.

1108
01:24:38.125 --> 01:24:39.250
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

1109
01:24:40.583 --> 01:24:41.916
Whoo!

1110
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.708
-No. no. we'll never make it!
-No. we'll make it.

1111
01:24:49.791 --> 01:24:51.333
-You don't have a chance.
-Just trust me.

1112
01:24:51.416 --> 01:24:52.583
No!

1113
01:25:25.083 --> 01:25:26.083
S-sorry. Susie.

1114
01:25:26.166 --> 01:25:27.166
Sorry?

1115
01:25:27.833 --> 01:25:28.875
Get away!

1116
01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:30.333
Sorry. what are you--?

1117
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000

Slow down!

1119
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:48.458
-Dad!
-Can't you see me?

1120
01:25:50.416 --> 01:25:51.625
Slow down!

1121
01:25:51.708 --> 01:25:52.416
Stop!

1122
01:25:56.458 --> 01:25:57.333
I see you have a--

1123
01:25:57.416 --> 01:25:59.791
Make a flat tire joke.
swear I'm gonna lose it.

1124
01:26:02.666 --> 01:26:04.166
I just want to say let's go.

1125
01:26:04.833 --> 01:26:05.958
Good.

1126
01:26:09.833 --> 01:26:10.833
Seatbelt.

1127
01:26:15.958 --> 01:26:17.750
Hey. hey. Hey. hey-hey.

1128
01:26:30.083 --> 01:26:31.333
We're gonna catch him.

1129
01:26:31.416 --> 01:26:32.291
Shortcut. nine o'clock.

1130
01:26:32.375 --> 01:26:33.458
-What?
-What?

1131
01:26:33.541 --> 01:26:34.291
That's eight.

1132
01:26:34.375 --> 01:26:36.000
That's an eight? What do you
mean? -This is nine.

1133
01:26:36.083 --> 01:26:37.875
That's not a nine!
It looks like a baby pirate
hand.

1134
01:26:37.958 --> 01:26:40.375
-Argh!
-Okay-okay. no more hand signal.
okay?

1135
01:26:40.458 --> 01:26:41.833
Go that way.

1136
01:26:50.125 --> 01:26:51.333
Gotta go faster.

1137
01:26:51.416 --> 01:26:52.958
That's as fast as I can go.

1138
01:26:57.875 --> 01:26:59.458
Not if we use the jet.

1139
01:27:00.125 --> 01:27:01.291
How?

1140
01:27:02.208 --> 01:27:03.875
If I were you. I'd hold on.

1141
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:18.791
Aah!

1142
01:27:24.166 --> 01:27:25.416
Stop the trucks!

1143
01:27:25.916 --> 01:27:27.333
Stop the trucks now!

1144
01:27:39.333 --> 01:27:41.583
Hit the back. not the middle.

1145
01:27:41.666 --> 01:27:42.750
Okay!

1146
01:27:44.625 --> 01:27:45.583
Aah!

1147
01:28:14.083 --> 01:28:15.416

1148
01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:29.916
Morgan. hey!

1149
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.291
Well done. Chris.

1150
01:29:08.791 --> 01:29:09.625
You want to earn

1151
01:29:10.875 --> 01:29:12.250
a bigger cut of the pie?

1152
01:29:14.375 --> 01:29:15.708
You killed my brother.

1153
01:29:16.666 --> 01:29:17.666
Ah. yeah.

1154
01:29:31.458 --> 01:29:32.458
Chris!

1155
01:29:33.458 --> 01:29:35.833
-I told you wear your seat belt!
-Go!

1156
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Go.

1157
01:29:43.166 --> 01:29:45.666
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1158
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:46.708
You're sinking!

1159
01:29:52.708 --> 01:29:53.875
Get the outriggers out.

1160
01:29:53.958 --> 01:29:55.416
Extend
the outriggers down!

1161
01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:56.958
Which switch?

1162
01:29:57.041 --> 01:29:58.541
-Where's the button?
-By the wheel.

1163
01:29:58.625 --> 01:29:59.750
By the wheel!

1164
01:30:02.375 --> 01:30:03.625
I got this. you drive.

1165
01:30:13.708 --> 01:30:15.125
You gonna run?

1166
01:30:15.208 --> 01:30:16.333
No.

1167
01:30:16.416 --> 01:30:17.625
Get on.

1168
01:30:22.916 --> 01:30:23.916
Seatbelt?

1169
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:24.916
-Yes.

1170
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:25.958
Hit it!

1171
01:30:26.041 --> 01:30:27.125
Hold tight!

1172
01:30:28.375 --> 01:30:29.333
-Go.
-Go.

1173
01:31:01.208 --> 01:31:02.333
Aah!

1174
01:31:13.625 --> 01:31:15.208
Jump on the count of five.

1175
01:31:15.291 --> 01:31:17.125
I can't hear you!

1176
01:31:18.375 --> 01:31:19.750
Five!

1177
01:31:19.833 --> 01:31:20.916
What?!

1178
01:31:27.625 --> 01:31:30.583
I know you said no
more hand signals!

1179
01:31:31.708 --> 01:31:33.291
This is an exception!

1180
01:31:35.916 --> 01:31:37.125
Four!

1181
01:31:38.291 --> 01:31:39.291
Three!

01:31:49.541 --> 01:31:50.750
Jump!

1184
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:57.375
Aah!

1185
01:32:04.833 --> 01:32:05.875
Ah.

1186
01:32:37.625 --> 01:32:38.625
Huh.

1187
01:32:39.333 --> 01:32:40.583
Don't be scared.

1188
01:32:41.666 --> 01:32:43.500
I'm here. I am with you.

1189
01:33:48.416 --> 01:33:49.291
Where is Chris?

1190
01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:52.625
Chris!

1191
01:33:53.125 --> 01:33:54.125
Chris!

1192
01:33:55.791 --> 01:33:56.791
Chris!

1193
01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:03.500
Chris.

1194
01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.416
How
did you get my diary?

1195
01:35:10.833 --> 01:35:13.125
You two have always been with
me.

1196
01:35:21.208 --> 01:35:22.208
Dad?

1197
01:35:33.375 --> 01:35:34.458
I understand now.

1198
01:35:54.916 --> 01:35:55.750
Chris!

1199
01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:57.625
It's a beautiful moment
but I really could use a hand.

1200
01:35:59.583 --> 01:36:00.708
Chris!

1201
01:36:02.916 --> 01:36:04.166
I thought you'd never make it.

1202
01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:05.583
-Oh.
-Are you okay?

1203
01:36:05.666 --> 01:36:06.416
You too.

1204
01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:08.666
Oh. I'm scared-scared
of heights. I mean

1205
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:11.250
I'm alive. I'm alive!

1206
01:36:11.333 --> 01:36:12.875
Oh. and I'm totally single

1207
01:36:12.958 --> 01:36:15.125
and now is a good time for me to
say that I'm disease-free. too.

1208
01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:17.083
-Uh-huh.
-Uh. I had a scare with
hepatitis.

1209
01:36:17.166 --> 01:36:18.833
but it turned out to be nothing.
It was a cold.

1210
01:36:21.166 --> 01:36:22.166
Hey.

1211
01:36:23.833 --> 01:36:25.333
Don't even think
about it. bangchui.

1212
01:36:25.416 --> 01:36:27.083
But I
thought we're family.

1213
01:36:28.083 --> 01:36:29.333
We are not family.

1214
01:36:29.958 --> 01:36:32.583
How do you think
you even stand a chance with my
daughter?

1215
01:36:33.666 --> 01:36:34.875
What? What does that mean?

1216
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.166
You have a lot to learn.

1217
01:36:43.291 --> 01:36:44.291
Okay. Confucius.

1218
01:36:46.166 --> 01:36:48.000

This is your great idea?

1224
01:37:04.791 --> 01:37:05.791
You have any idea?

1225
01:37:17.208 --> 01:37:19.083
-Don't move.
-Get on the
ground!

1226
01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:20.583
Put your hands behind your back!

1227
01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.416
The bridge is now under control.

1228
01:37:30.416 --> 01:37:31.166
Pull!

1229
01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:32.583

1233
01:38:13.208 --> 01:38:14.833
-Dragon Luo!
-Huh?

1234
01:38:15.791 --> 01:38:18.375
We have just been notified.
there's a new mission.

1235
01:38:20.333 --> 01:38:21.916
You wanna join us?

1236
01:38:29.125 --> 01:38:32.250

You go. I got this.

1239
01:38:45.125 --> 01:38:46.083
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1240
01:38:46.166 --> 01:38:47.166
Wrong hand.

1241
01:38:47.458 --> 01:38:48.708
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1242
01:38:48.791 --> 01:38:49.958
-This one?
-Yes.

1243
01:38:50.333 --> 01:38:51.333
Oh.

1244
01:38:52.291 --> 01:38:53.291
One more.

1245
01:38:53.875 --> 01:38:55.583
I'm wiping the
company out. Chris.

1246
01:38:55.666 --> 01:38:56.875
Yeah. no shit. Captain Obvious.

1247
01:38:56.958 --> 01:38:59.916
You got a bunch of Arabs in
Ninja masks bleeding this place
dry.

1248
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.833
And while you're wiping the
company out. you know what I'm
doing?

1249
01:39:01.916 --> 01:39:03.875
-No.
-You told me to date a little
more. so uh.

1250
01:39:03.958 --> 01:39:05.833
see Father Time over there
with the AK 47?

1251
01:39:05.916 --> 01:39:07.541
-Yeah.
-We've been talking online.

1252
01:39:07.625 --> 01:39:10.500
I met him through an app called
Finder. I thought it was "find
her"

1253
01:39:10.583 --> 01:39:12.166
but it's really a "finder" app.

1254
01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:13.500
We share a lot of commonalities.

1255
01:39:13.583 --> 01:39:16.000
We both live in small villages.
proficient with firearms.

1256
01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:17.166
Both watched Lawrence of Arabia.

1257
01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:18.250
Come on!

1258
01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:24.500
Hey. hey.

1259
01:39:24.583 --> 01:39:25.583
Come on!

1260
01:39:30.125 --> 01:39:31.500
-Hey.
-Come on!

1261
01:39:32.875 --> 01:39:34.166
Go!

1262
01:39:35.583 --> 01:39:36.583
My man.

1263
01:39:38.208 --> 01:39:39.458
Look at her. man.

1264
01:39:40.166 --> 01:39:41.166
She is hot.

1265
01:39:42.083 --> 01:39:43.083
That booty.

1266
01:39:43.625 --> 01:39:45.791
I'm the type of guy
to bend that over and…

1267
01:39:47.333 --> 01:39:49.250
smack that ass. I mean.

1268
01:39:50.125 --> 01:39:51.500
Whoo-- I'm a freak.

1269
01:39:51.583 --> 01:39:52.791
I will eat some ass.

1270
01:39:53.416 --> 01:39:56.041
I will stay down there.
You know what they call that?

1271
01:39:56.125 --> 01:39:59.541
They call that a capsized
motorboat because it's a
motorboat upside down.

1272
01:39:59.625 --> 01:40:01.291
I mean--

1273
01:40:04.708 --> 01:40:05.916
-Dragon Luo?
-Yes.

1274
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.875

You keep a gun under the seat?

1281
01:40:26.041 --> 01:40:28.958
I also keep one in my pants
but it could be like a Walther
PPK.

1282
01:40:29.375 --> 01:40:30.833
It's a small gun.

1283
01:40:32.625 --> 01:40:33.833
-Dragon Luo?
-Yes.

1284
01:40:33.916 --> 01:40:35.583

01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:49.500
Ten o'clock?

1291
01:40:51.583 --> 01:40:52.750
Shit. oh shit.

1292
01:40:53.666 --> 01:40:56.166
Ah! You told me
you would be better.

1293
01:40:56.250 --> 01:40:58.041
My name is Dragon Luo.

1294
01:40:58.125 --> 01:40:59.291
I forgot your name.

1295
01:40:59.375 --> 01:41:01.916
You can call me
big brother or Jackie Chan.

1296
01:41:10.125 --> 01:41:10.958
Cut!

1297
01:41:11.041 --> 01:41:12.125
That's a nine.

1298
01:41:12.916 --> 01:41:14.083
Uh. eight. now--

1299
01:41:14.166 --> 01:41:16.333
Just avoid the nine.
No more hand signal.

1300
01:41:16.416 --> 01:41:18.166
Oh! Go over there.

1301
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:21.416
One more. You. your two hands
all block my. my face.

1302
01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:22.708
One more.

1303
01:41:23.458 --> 01:41:25.666
How was that nine?
That looks like a baby pirate hand.

1304
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:28.583
Okay. here real quick:
what's a pirate's favorite letter?

1305
01:41:28.666 --> 01:41:29.500
What?

1306
01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:32.416
R? No. you would
think it's the R.

1307
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.875
but it's the "C."

1308
01:41:37.166 --> 01:41:38.250
He steal my shot.

1309
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.625
He just keeps saying dialogue.

1310
01:41:45.166 --> 01:41:46.916
I don't even know
what you saying.
