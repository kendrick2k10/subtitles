73
00:05:45.146 --> 00:05:48.114
I want you to plant
your feet solidly

74
00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:50.149
on the rotting surface
of this earth

75
00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:53.086
and allow the flames
from the pits of hell

76
00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:54.857
to lick at your heels.

77
00:05:54.892 --> 00:05:59.532
I want the hot breath of
a thousand rapists and murderers

78
00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.160
to enter you.

79
00:06:07.905 --> 00:06:10.510
Your legs grow heavy.

80
00:06:10.545 --> 00:06:13.777
As the filth rises higher.

81
00:06:13.812 --> 00:06:16.175
your knees swell with pain

82
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.519
as the burning passes through
and up.

83
00:06:19.554 --> 00:06:22.181
ripping and tearing
at your genitals.

84
00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:23.853
This is getting weird.

85
00:06:23.888 --> 00:06:26.691
Silence!

86
00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:30.629

with the putrid stench

87
00:06:30.664 --> 00:06:32.697
from the bowels
of Satan himself.

88
00:06:32.732 --> 00:06:34.061
And it feels wonderful.

89
00:06:34.096 --> 00:06:39.506
Your chest is hollow.

90
00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:41.200
A cavern.

91
00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:47.712
echoing the cries of
every widow. slave. and cripple

92
00:06:47.747 --> 00:06:49.483
since the dawn of time.

93
00:06:49.518 --> 00:06:52.079
Your heart is black.

94
00:06:52.114 --> 00:06:53.916

95
00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:56.622
Yes. Yes.

96

I'm asking for.

97
00:06:59.594 --> 00:07:04.124
This is the monster I crave!

98
00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:07.193
Your neck is a snake

99
00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:11.032
choking on a carcass
twice its size.

100
00:07:11.067 --> 00:07:15.872
stretched and bubbling over with
the hot blood of its victim.

101
00:07:15.907 --> 00:07:19.040
Your face and head drip
with slipping flesh.

102
00:07:19.075 --> 00:07:23.715
Only chips of rotten teeth
and bulging blind eyes

103
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.147
hang on a skull
that is infested with maggots

104
00:07:27.182 --> 00:07:31.690
that have come to eat
what's left of the empty.

who pours their soul out

165

onto the ground
to be stepped on

166
00:13:34.351 --> 00:13:37.319
by zombies or dullards.
then yeah. you know.

those four sinister notes.

sprays across the floor

273

The Whistler grabs at his heel
and slips in the pool of blood.

275

He hits the floor with a thud.

276
00:20:45.386 --> 00:20:47.518

across the room.

277

out from under the bed

00:33:43.328 --> 00:33:45.757
I feel nervous and scared.
Can -- I'm anxious.

537
00:33:45.792 --> 00:33:47.396
I don't like it.
C-Can you stop. please?

538
00:33:47.431 --> 00:33:49.431
Can you put the knife down.
please?

539
00:33:49.466 --> 00:33:51.169
Can you put the knife down?
Don't do that.

540
00:33:51.204 --> 00:33:54.667
Can you please stop. please?

541
00:33:54.702 --> 00:33:57.571
Please.

542
00:33:57.606 --> 00:33:58.638
See?

543
00:33:58.673 --> 00:34:01.179
I just transformed into art.

544
00:34:01.214 --> 00:34:02.675
I went from a girl to a feeling.

545
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:04.413
And you instantly had
a visceral.

546
00:34:04.448 --> 00:34:05.612
emotional response to me.

547
00:34:05.647 --> 00:34:09.649
That is what good art does.

548
00:34:13.754 --> 00:34:15.589
I guess.

549
00:34:15.624 --> 00:34:19.659
And I could transform you
if you let me.

550
00:34:27.207 --> 00:34:28.338
What was that?

551
00:34:28.373 --> 00:34:30.340
Relax.

552
00:34:30.375 --> 00:34:32.144
I was just trying
to make a point.

553
00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.245
I wasn't gonna cut open my
throat on your kitchen floor.

554
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.479
I know that. It just --
I-I got. um --

555
00:34:37.514 --> 00:34:39.745
I got a little freaked out.

556
00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.648
I got little scared.

557
00:34:41.683 --> 00:34:43.320
Oh. no.

558
00:34:43.355 --> 00:34:46.488
I don't want you
to be scared.

559
00:34:46.523 --> 00:34:49.557
I want you to be
the best that you can be.

561
00:35:00.339 --> 00:35:04.638

My rock star.

563
00:35:06.345 --> 00:35:08.444

Yeah. and you're a fucking snob.
so...

694
00:43:22.038 --> 00:43:23.906

someone who pours their soul

695

out onto the ground to be
stepped on

696

Goddamn fucking music. right?

741

I mean. have you ever
really examined music?

742
00:46:15.607 --> 00:46:19.147
I mean. fucking really examined
it. like it's true power?

743
00:46:19.182 --> 00:46:20.379
Here we go.

744
00:46:20.414 --> 00:46:22.084

It's cool.

745
00:46:22.119 --> 00:46:23.481
It's cool if you guys refuse
to go deep like I do.

746
00:46:23.516 --> 00:46:25.186
I just happen to choose
to think about shit

747
00:46:25.221 --> 00:46:27.452
like how music is the soundtrack
between good and evil.

748
00:46:27.487 --> 00:46:29.553
and how good and evil
are. like. inextricably linked

749
00:46:29.588 --> 00:46:33.194
in a metaphysical battle.

750
00:46:33.229 --> 00:46:36.065
I'm sorry. but did you not
finish high school?

751
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.968
No.
No. I didn't finish high school.

752
00:46:38.003 --> 00:46:39.563
I would expect someone like you
to judge me on whether or not

753
00:46:39.598 --> 00:46:41.466
I completed some
antiquated educational system

754
00:46:41.501 --> 00:46:43.941
that teaches kids
more lies than truth.

755
00:46:43.976 --> 00:46:46.537
-Preach.
-Let me ask you this.

756
00:46:46.572 --> 00:46:49.078
What's the happiest chord?

757
00:46:49.113 --> 00:46:51.509
Oh. don't ask me. I play bass.

758
00:46:51.544 --> 00:46:53.478
-D fucking Major.
-MAN #- Says who?

759
00:46:53.513 --> 00:46:56.085
It doesn't matter who says.
but you can't deny

760
00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.548
that certain chords
or chord progressions

761
00:46:57.583 --> 00:47:01.024
can make you feel happy
or sad or mad. Correct?

762
00:47:01.059 --> 00:47:03.191
Yeah. well. isn't that
the whole point of music?

763
00:47:03.226 --> 00:47:06.557
Yeah. dude. That really isn't
all that deep.

764
00:47:06.592 --> 00:47:08.900
I'll get deep. I'm just dipping
my toe in right now

765
00:47:08.935 --> 00:47:10.495
so you won't fucking drown.

766
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.629
How did I end up
in a band with you?

767
00:47:12.664 --> 00:47:15.335
I fucking love you guys.

768
00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:17.502
Yes. yes. it's a given that
music can produce emotions.

769
00:47:17.537 --> 00:47:19.438
Everyone knows that.
But have you ever really thought

770
00:47:19.473 --> 00:47:21.946
about the magical mechanics
of that process?

771
00:47:21.981 --> 00:47:24.278
Dude. we should call the band

772
00:47:24.313 --> 00:47:26.247
-Magical Mechanics.
-- I love that.

773
00:47:26.282 --> 00:47:29.250
I arrange my flesh and bones
in a certain pattern

774
00:47:29.285 --> 00:47:31.054
and press them against
steel strings.

775
00:47:31.089 --> 00:47:32.957
and these strings have been
tightened or loosened

776
00:47:32.992 --> 00:47:35.421
to such a degree that it creates
a blending of sound

777
00:47:35.456 --> 00:47:37.654
that somehow.
over thousands of years.

778
00:47:37.689 --> 00:47:39.359
we as humans have decided
made sense.

779
00:47:39.394 --> 00:47:41.130
And then that sound travels
through an electric cord.

780
00:47:41.165 --> 00:47:44.331
through a wooden box.
and then out a manmade speaker.

781
00:47:44.366 --> 00:47:47.565
And then the sound travels
through the air

782
00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.138
and into your ear.

783
00:47:49.173 --> 00:47:50.568
vibrating a piece
of fucking cartilage.

784
00:47:50.603 --> 00:47:52.669
sending signals instantaneously
through millions.

785
00:47:52.704 --> 00:47:54.308
no. billions of neurons

786
00:47:54.343 --> 00:47:56.013
where -- where nerve cells
connect to synapses

787
00:47:56.048 --> 00:47:58.675
and then stimulates
a fucking emotion.

788
00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:01.216
An emotion. you guys.

789
00:48:01.251 --> 00:48:04.318
I cry every time I hear
"Nothing Compares to You."

790
00:48:04.353 --> 00:48:07.453
She cries every time she hears
"Nothing Compares to You."

791
00:48:07.488 --> 00:48:09.290
Okay.
You still haven't said anything

792
00:48:09.325 --> 00:48:11.160
I didn't already know.

793
00:48:11.195 --> 00:48:14.526
- Okay. class. What if I told
you that stimulating an emotion

794
00:48:14.561 --> 00:48:18.431
was just the beginning. the most
rudimentary of functions?

795
00:48:18.466 --> 00:48:20.664
You guys ever heard
about the brown note?

796
00:48:20.699 --> 00:48:23.601
Supposedly it makes you
shit your pants.

797
00:48:23.636 --> 00:48:25.735
I'm serious. The military
discovered it or something.

798
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:29.013
What if I told you
that the power of music in sound

799
00:48:29.048 --> 00:48:32.049
is limitless and I've figured
out how to harness it?

800
00:48:32.084 --> 00:48:33.545
Then why aren't we famous yet?

801
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.481
I'm not talking about writing
a three-minute pop song.

802
00:48:35.516 --> 00:48:36.713
I'm talking about
note combinations

803
00:48:36.748 --> 00:48:38.616
that can transform
consciousness.

804
00:48:38.651 --> 00:48:41.751
notes that can infiltrate
the psyche of a sane human being

805
00:48:41.786 --> 00:48:44.259
and unravel them into madness.

806
00:48:44.294 --> 00:48:47.691
Dude. how fucking high are you?

807
00:48:47.726 --> 00:48:50.694
Wait. how did you figure
all this out?

808
00:48:50.729 --> 00:48:52.498
Okay. well. I-I haven't figured
it out completely.

809
00:48:52.533 --> 00:48:54.731
but I have figured out how to
exactly --

810
00:48:54.766 --> 00:48:57.635
MAN #- There it is.
I call bullshit.

811
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:59.703
I have figured out
a sequence of six notes

812
00:48:59.738 --> 00:49:02.211
that if played it correctly
will manifest evil.

813
00:49:02.246 --> 00:49:04.774
I think Black Sabbath figured
that out like 50 years ago.

814
00:49:04.809 --> 00:49:07.744
- That's funny.

815
00:49:07.779 --> 00:49:10.318
Alright. I got to get out
of here. guys.

816
00:49:10.353 --> 00:49:12.089
I'm fucking beat.

817
00:49:12.124 --> 00:49:13.618
I'm with you.

818
00:49:13.653 --> 00:49:15.356
It's been interesting.
as always. bro.

819
00:49:15.391 --> 00:49:18.326
-Mm.
-MAN #-

820

Lightning.

821
00:49:21.166 --> 00:49:23.595
So what are the six notes?

822
00:49:25.467 --> 00:49:28.072
It's not that easy.
I mean. it's complicated.

823
00:49:28.107 --> 00:49:30.404
You have to be -- They have to
be played in a particular way.

824
00:49:30.439 --> 00:49:34.507
Like I said. bullshit.

825
00:49:34.542 --> 00:49:37.807
Come on. Just tell me
what the notes are.

826
00:49:37.842 --> 00:49:41.481
Please. Please.

827
00:49:46.125 --> 00:49:47.685

Nothing.

832
00:50:04.473 --> 00:50:06.341
I was. um...

833
00:50:06.376 --> 00:50:09.212
I was just sitting.

834

He's not answering his phone

837

Surprise. surprise.

838
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.167
Okay. look.

839
00:50:30.202 --> 00:50:33.301
What if something's wrong?
What if he's hurt or something?

840
00:50:37.374 --> 00:50:41.409
What if he's just being
a petty little bitch?

841
00:50:41.444 --> 00:50:43.840
Hey. don't let him do this
to you. okay?

842
00:50:43.875 --> 00:50:45.644
He's just trying to
fuck with your head

843
00:50:45.679 --> 00:50:47.250
because you have something
important going on tomorrow

844
00:50:47.285 --> 00:50:49.780

Okay. Suit yourself.

849

- Okay.

894
00:58:39.218 --> 00:58:40.954
Well...

895
00:58:40.989 --> 00:58:42.923
Sorry to bug you.

896
00:58:46.093 --> 00:58:48.225
Hey.

897
00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:52.328
You know. I don't think
we'll be seeing Marcus anymore.

898
00:58:52.363 --> 00:58:54.330
No?

899
00:58:55.872 --> 00:58:57.740
No.

900
00:58:57.775 --> 00:59:00.875
- Why do you say that?

901
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:03.075
I think something bad
happened to him.

902
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.981
What are you talking about?

903
00:59:12.988 --> 00:59:16.220
Hope.

904
00:59:16.255 --> 00:59:19.157
do you know who
Gabrielle Berlatier was?

905
00:59:24.769 --> 00:59:27.132
She worked

906
00:59:27.167 --> 00:59:32.038
in a whorehouse
in southern France as a maid.

907
00:59:34.746 --> 00:59:37.406
She was working there

908
00:59:37.441 --> 00:59:41.410
to earn money to pay off
her medical bills

909
00:59:41.445 --> 00:59:44.985
after being savagely attacked
by a rabid dog.

910
00:59:50.388 --> 00:59:54.159
O...kay.

911
00:59:57.098 --> 00:59:58.295
She was also the reason

912
00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:01.067
Vincent Van Gogh
chopped off his own ear.

913
01:00:04.435 --> 01:00:06.941
- Why are you
telling me this?

914
01:00:08.813 --> 01:00:12.408
He thought
if he offered her his own flesh.

915
01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:14.212
it would help her heal.

916
01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.694
That's crazy.

917
01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:30.701
Is it?

918
01:00:33.904 --> 01:00:36.773
Tomorrow.

919
01:00:36.808 --> 01:00:40.007
at the acting class.

920
01:00:40.042 --> 01:00:43.373
I really feel like
I'm gonna shine.

921
01:00:43.408 --> 01:00:45.375
Do something special.

922
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:46.816
- Yeah.

923
01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:50.281
That's -- That's great.

924
01:00:50.316 --> 01:00:52.184
Yeah.

925
01:00:53.891 --> 01:00:56.089
I prepared a monologue.

926
01:00:58.962 --> 01:01:01.292
Do you want to hear it?

927
01:01:01.327 --> 01:01:03.294
- Well. I mean...

928
01:01:06.398 --> 01:01:09.366
Yeah. O-Okay. Sure.

929
01:01:12.778 --> 01:01:17.748
"The Debt." Ryan Knightley.

930
01:01:17.783 --> 01:01:21.246
At the foot of my bed.

931
01:01:21.281 --> 01:01:24.051
reaching.

932
01:01:24.086 --> 01:01:28.451
but just out of reach.

933
01:01:28.486 --> 01:01:31.520
my flesh

934
01:01:31.555 --> 01:01:34.831
covers bone

935
01:01:34.866 --> 01:01:37.361
shadowing the breaks and cracks.

936
01:01:38.903 --> 01:01:41.497
But not the scars
that rest on top.

937
01:01:43.468 --> 01:01:47.239
Left behind by
otherworldly creatures

938
01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:50.176
masquerading as civilized men.

939
01:01:56.349 --> 01:02:02.958
Death needs more yet.

940
01:02:02.993 --> 01:02:05.191
but needs me more.

941
01:02:07.833 --> 01:02:12.495
I am an allegoria of nothing.

942
01:02:15.038 --> 01:02:18.204
A reflection that refuses
to look back.

943
01:02:20.175 --> 01:02:22.813
A human vampire

944
01:02:22.848 --> 01:02:26.443
with endless time

945
01:02:26.478 --> 01:02:30.150
that's about to run out.

946
01:02:50.436 --> 01:02:52.238
