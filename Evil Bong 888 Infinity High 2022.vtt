3
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.717
- All those years
have led to this.

4
00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:31.031
All those torturous.
delinquent years.

5
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:35.069
when I was too high to remember
have led to this moment.

6
00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:39.763
the most important.
lucrative night of my life.

7
00:00:39.763 --> 00:00:42.214
Rabbit. look what you've done.

8
00:00:43.388 --> 00:00:45.045
You've done good. buddy.

9
00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.357
You finally moved up and
got a piece of the pie.

10
00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:51.706
From living the high life
to living the high in life.

11
00:00:58.334 --> 00:00:59.749
Rabbit's back. baby.

12
00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.160
- Geez. look at the time.
I gotta get going here.

13
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.644
I'm gonna have customers.

14
00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:09.991
I mean. fine dining patrons.

15
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.649
beating down the
door in minutes.

16
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.901
I'm sorry. ma'am.

17
00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:25.283
miss. we're not open yet.

18
00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:28.148
You'll have to wait out front

19
00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:31.392
with the rest of the
customers in line.

20
00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:34.050
There is a line up
front. isn't it?

21
00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:39.020
Geez. I spend a fortune
on advertisement.

22
00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:42.783
Oh. please.

23
00:02:43.818 --> 00:02:45.406
Don't cry beautiful lady.

24
00:02:47.788 --> 00:02:50.342
You certainly have
a full basket.

25
00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:52.758
They catch the tears.

26
00:02:52.758 --> 00:02:55.244
What's your name young hot lady?

27
00:02:56.762 --> 00:03:00.249
- Thomasina Atkins.
people call me Tom.

28
00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:01.560
- I'm rabbit.

29
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.632
I'm the owner of
this establishment.

30
00:03:04.632 --> 00:03:06.358
- It's beautiful.

31
00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:08.188
- Thank you.

32
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.086
I spend a freaking
fortune on it.

33
00:03:10.914 --> 00:03:11.846
- I can tell.

34
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.091
- Grand opening tonight.

35
00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:17.197
- Oh. it's your big night.

36
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.440
I'm so sorry to cause
you any distress.

37
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.616
- Believe me. anybody
in this dress is

38
00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:25.274
no problem at all.

39
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.035
What can I do for you?

40
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:31.487
- I just lost my waitress
job down the street

41
00:03:31.487 --> 00:03:34.110
and I'm on a really
tight budget.

42
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.527
and now I'm not gonna be
able to afford to pay rent.

43
00:03:37.527 --> 00:03:39.874
or keep my bangy
thingies in check.

44
00:03:39.874 --> 00:03:42.877
or get any frivolous
streaming services

45
00:03:42.877 --> 00:03:45.639
or buy cowboy hats
from my lizard.

46
00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.056
- Oh. that's a hell of a pickle.

47
00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:53.612
- No. I don't want
sex from you. Mr.

48
00:03:53.612 --> 00:03:57.823
- Oh. why should you be
different than anyone else?

49
00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:01.620
I got it.

50
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.415
The restaurant opens
in a couple of hours.

51
00:04:03.415 --> 00:04:05.106
and I could use all
the help I can get.

52
00:04:11.112 --> 00:04:14.530
- Does it look like
these hands do dishes?

53
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.083
- No.

54
00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:18.154
- And I do not understand
the mysteries of cooking.

55
00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:20.432
- Oh. we have people for that.

56
00:04:20.432 --> 00:04:21.571
- And I don't do that.

57
00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.334
- Be a server?

58
00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:26.196
- Heck no.

59
00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:30.166
- Well. what is it that you do?

60
00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:36.206
You do that very well.

61
00:04:36.206 --> 00:04:37.518
- Totally.

62
00:04:37.518 --> 00:04:38.726
- I've got it.

63
00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:45.250
I think I just found my
new double D.

64
00:04:49.323 --> 00:04:50.186
Hostess.

65
00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:53.534
- What does. I'll take it.

66
00:04:54.742 --> 00:04:55.674
- Deal.

67
00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:07.652
So. this is where
the magic happens.

68
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.379
- Wouldn't that be the kitchen?

69
00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.105
- No. this is where they
make the food disappear.

70
00:05:15.556 --> 00:05:16.902
A little restaurant humor.

71
00:05:16.902 --> 00:05:18.041
- Very little.

72
00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:22.183
It's so elegant. unless
it cost you a fortune.

73
00:05:22.183 --> 00:05:23.012
- It did.

74
00:05:24.427 --> 00:05:28.431
I inherited a small fortune
from a nephew who croaked.

75
00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:29.984
- He died?

76
00:05:29.984 --> 00:05:32.642
Aw. he must have
loved you so much.

77
00:05:32.642 --> 00:05:33.540
- I never met him.

78
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.714
- You never met him?

79
00:05:35.714 --> 00:05:40.340
- No. I was too busy getting
high over multiple dimensions.

80
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.033
It's a long story.

81
00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:46.622
I'd love to share with
you over coffee one day.

82
00:05:46.622 --> 00:05:48.209
- That's okay.

83
00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:49.590
- Okay.

84
00:05:55.562 --> 00:05:57.287
I'm not going back
to the old Rabbit.

85
00:05:57.287 --> 00:05:59.117
I'm not going back
to the old Rabbit.

86
00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:01.050
I'm not going back
to the old Rabbit.

87
00:06:02.741 --> 00:06:03.673
- Then don't.

88
00:06:06.642 --> 00:06:07.643
- So.

89
00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:12.372
would you like to meet the
rest of the crew and...

90
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.442
- Let's do it.

91
00:06:13.442 --> 00:06:14.684
- This way.

92
00:06:22.727 --> 00:06:25.661
Girls. ladies. let
me introduce you

93
00:06:26.938 --> 00:06:30.113
to our new.

94
00:06:31.598 --> 00:06:34.911
a person at the front of
the house. Tom Atkins.

95
00:06:39.295 --> 00:06:40.192
Girls.

96
00:06:42.022 --> 00:06:44.093
are you texting each other?

97
00:06:44.093 --> 00:06:46.302
You could just
talk to each other.

98
00:06:46.302 --> 00:06:47.890
it's not that hard.

99
00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:50.513
Okay. good.

100
00:06:51.963 --> 00:06:53.827
Well. they're busy right now.

101
00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:55.518
They're prepping
for the big opening.

102
00:06:55.518 --> 00:06:57.002
- Obviously.

103
00:06:57.002 --> 00:07:01.179
- Let me show you to the
heart and soul. the kitchen.

104
00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:03.319
You're gonna love our new chef.

105
00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.665
- Oh. is he well known?

106
00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:08.497
- She. and she is known
across space and time.

107
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.432
- Wow. girl power. all right.

108
00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.433
- Yes.

109
00:07:22.994 --> 00:07:23.995
Here it is.

110
00:07:24.927 --> 00:07:25.824
- A word with you. Rabbit.

111
00:07:25.824 --> 00:07:26.929
- In a moment.

112
00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:28.448
First. I want you to meet Tom.

113
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.657
Tom. this is Sal.

114
00:07:30.657 --> 00:07:34.868
the best cook who answered
my one ads. Sal Monella.

115
00:07:36.628 --> 00:07:38.216
- Your name is Sal Monella?

116
00:07:38.216 --> 00:07:39.804
- That is correct.

117
00:07:39.804 --> 00:07:41.599
- You have Sal Monella
in your kitchen.

118
00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.048
- I have spread myself

119
00:07:43.048 --> 00:07:46.224
over every inch of every
surface of this establishment.

120
00:07:46.224 --> 00:07:48.295
- You got a problem or...

121
00:07:48.295 --> 00:07:51.298
- I just wouldn't
tell the diners that.

122
00:07:51.298 --> 00:07:53.956
- Pleased to make your
acquaintance .

123
00:07:53.956 --> 00:07:54.957
- Maybe later.

124
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.065
- Your name is Tom. is it?

125
00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:01.308
- It is.

126
00:08:01.308 --> 00:08:03.552
- And yet you are
a woman. allegedly.

127
00:08:03.552 --> 00:08:05.105
- Definitely.

128
00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:07.314
- I'll be watching you.

129
00:08:07.314 --> 00:08:08.557
- Good to know.

130
00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:17.497
- Sal. you wanted
a word with me?

131
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.981
- Permission to
speak commandant.

132
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:19.809
- Granted.

133
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.742
- This is union.

134
00:08:21.742 --> 00:08:24.124
this chef is unacceptable.

135
00:08:24.124 --> 00:08:27.127
- If you're talking union.
you are like banging her.

136
00:08:27.127 --> 00:08:30.026
yes. it's very unacceptable.

137
00:08:30.026 --> 00:08:33.582
- I am not stopping.
nor will I ever stop it.

138
00:08:33.582 --> 00:08:35.791
- Then what's the problem.

139
00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:39.173
- I am quite notorious
for my food. yeah?

140
00:08:39.173 --> 00:08:40.002
- Yeah.

141
00:08:40.002 --> 00:08:40.830
- Yeah.

142
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.073
- Yeah.

143
00:08:42.073 --> 00:08:42.970
- My food. ridiculous
on this eyes. yeah?

144
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:43.799
Yeah.
- Yeah. yes.

145
00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.077
- Like clockwork. yeah?

146
00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:46.905
Yeah.

147
00:08:46.905 --> 00:08:47.906
- Yeah. yes.

148
00:08:49.252 --> 00:08:50.564
- Just like this time piece.

149
00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:52.393
which has survived many of wars

150
00:08:52.393 --> 00:08:54.395
and been handed down to me
throughout the generations.

151
00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:58.434
Tick-tock. tick-tock. tick-tock.

152
00:08:58.434 --> 00:09:00.643
tick-tock. tick-tock.
tick-tock...

153
00:09:00.643 --> 00:09:02.093
- What's the problem. Sal?

154
00:09:05.648 --> 00:09:07.685
- This is suicide.

155
00:09:07.685 --> 00:09:09.549
I cannot work with that bitch.

156
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.861
- But you've just met. Tom.

157
00:09:11.861 --> 00:09:13.449
- Not a confusingly named woman.

158
00:09:14.726 --> 00:09:16.107
Her.

159
00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:20.283
- That's right. it's
me motherfuckers.

160
00:09:20.283 --> 00:09:22.354
What's that sour
eating bitch

161
00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:23.597
complaining about now?

162
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:27.670
- You lack the kitchen acumen
to which I am accustomed.

163
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.225
- You slang slack at the
penitentiary. Pretzel Boy.

164
00:09:32.468 --> 00:09:35.195
- We Germans do not
look to the past.

165
00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:39.337
it is full of strife
from darkness.

166
00:09:39.337 --> 00:09:40.303
only to the future.

167
00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:43.272
But yeah. yeah.

168
00:09:43.272 --> 00:09:44.860
I trained and horned
my skills there.

169
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.034
- Dropping the soap
is not a skill.

170
00:09:47.034 --> 00:09:49.416
It's a choice .

171
00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:52.902
- Or I can slit your
tiny little throat.

172
00:09:52.902 --> 00:09:56.665
- Guys. guys. we gotta
learn to get along.

173
00:09:56.665 --> 00:10:00.323
At least just for tonight.
it's important to me.

174
00:10:00.323 --> 00:10:02.774
So maybe it's just
first night jitters.

175
00:10:02.774 --> 00:10:04.396
- Sal does not jitter.

176
00:10:06.364 --> 00:10:10.092
- That's not what inmate
number 5727543 said.

177
00:10:12.163 --> 00:10:14.096
- I cannot work under
these conditions. Rabbit.

178
00:10:14.096 --> 00:10:16.029
- Bitch. bitch. bitch.
- Everybody. please.

179
00:10:20.447 --> 00:10:22.104
- Not today. Satan.

180
00:10:22.104 --> 00:10:24.347
Not today. Satan.

181
00:10:24.347 --> 00:10:27.868
You got this. Rabbit.

182
00:10:27.868 --> 00:10:29.352
Don't go back to your old ways.

183
00:10:40.743 --> 00:10:42.607
I almost had a moment.

184
00:10:42.607 --> 00:10:45.437
- So. how do we course correct?

185
00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:47.474
- Man. we just
gotta work together.

186
00:10:47.474 --> 00:10:49.234
just for tonight. I beg of you.

187
00:10:50.891 --> 00:10:52.617
- You beg. Sal Monella?

188
00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:54.654
- Yes.

189
00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.208
- You need Sal Monella. no?

190
00:10:57.208 --> 00:10:57.967
- No. yes.

191
00:10:59.797 --> 00:11:01.143
- Fuck yes.

192
00:11:01.143 --> 00:11:02.040
- We're good.

193
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.663
- We're good.

194
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.009
- Want to hug it out?

195
00:11:05.009 --> 00:11:06.389
- The Germans do not hug.

196
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:07.528
- You sure?

197
00:11:07.528 --> 00:11:09.185
- Never. never ever.

198
00:11:10.221 --> 00:11:11.153
- Then we're good.

199
00:11:11.153 --> 00:11:12.637
- Yeah. we're always good.

200
00:11:12.637 --> 00:11:15.847
- So why don't you whip
up something as a trial

201
00:11:15.847 --> 00:11:17.469
or get the kinks worked out.

202
00:11:21.335 --> 00:11:22.336
- Such a treat for you.

203
00:11:22.336 --> 00:11:24.476
You hang on. I'll be right back.

204
00:11:27.963 --> 00:11:30.344
- Take it easier on
my guy. will you?

205
00:11:30.344 --> 00:11:31.173
- As if?

206
00:11:31.173 --> 00:11:32.001
- Please.

207
00:11:33.416 --> 00:11:37.835
- Okay. I'll lay off that
masturbate race motherfucker.

208
00:11:38.456 --> 00:11:39.975
- Thank you.

209
00:11:39.975 --> 00:11:42.874
- More time for me to plan
on taking over the world.

210
00:11:42.874 --> 00:11:44.462
- We're over that now.

211
00:11:44.462 --> 00:11:45.635
This is a restaurant.

212
00:11:46.878 --> 00:11:48.742
- With a side of
cosmic domination.

213
00:11:48.742 --> 00:11:51.331
- We're legit now. remember?

214
00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:53.540
- Oh. you're no
fucking fun anymore.

215
00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.129
- Just stick to the
recipes we labored over.

216
00:11:57.302 --> 00:11:59.028
- I am. dickhead.

217
00:11:59.028 --> 00:12:00.340
- I'll be waiting outside.

218
00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:09.521
Girls. you think you might
wanna try on your uniforms?

219
00:12:13.594 --> 00:12:15.700
- You are so
screwed. aren't you?

220
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.947
- I'm just circling the toilet
waiting for the big flush.

221
00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:26.815
- Or. you can pick yourself up
and go kick some ass tonight.

222
00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.508
- You're the only one
that's ever believed in me.

223
00:12:32.303 --> 00:12:33.614
- If you say so.

224
00:12:33.614 --> 00:12:34.823
- Do you really
think I can do it?

225
00:12:36.203 --> 00:12:39.551
- Okay. dick.

226
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:41.105
let's put our differences aside

227
00:12:41.105 --> 00:12:43.935
and do this for that
dumb motherfucker.

228
00:12:43.935 --> 00:12:45.212
for the Rabbit.

229
00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:46.731
You're down?

230
00:12:46.731 --> 00:12:49.458
- I'm down. for the Rabbit.

231
00:12:49.458 --> 00:12:52.116
- Good. let's start with
the French onion soup.

232
00:12:52.116 --> 00:12:54.187
- In French they call it zup.

233
00:12:54.187 --> 00:12:56.568
- Then we'll serve
up a .

234
00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:59.295
Next course will be a
goddamn .

235
00:12:59.295 --> 00:13:00.780
- I like it.

236
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.333
- And finish off

237
00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:04.093
with a motherfucking
beef burger .

238
00:13:04.093 --> 00:13:05.336
How do you like that shit?

239
00:13:05.336 --> 00:13:07.925
- My taste buds are
good .

240
00:13:07.925 --> 00:13:09.581
- Then burst a move.

241
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:10.513
- Yeah.

242
00:13:19.695 --> 00:13:21.490
- What's the fucking problem?

243
00:13:24.286 --> 00:13:25.183
- Yeah. they came.

244
00:13:27.427 --> 00:13:29.463
- What's the fucking problem?

245
00:13:29.463 --> 00:13:31.086
- The ingredients
are .

246
00:13:31.086 --> 00:13:32.742
- Say what?

247
00:13:32.742 --> 00:13:36.401
- There are no ingredients.
except for this.

248
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:41.096
- Fucking Rabbit.

249
00:13:41.096 --> 00:13:42.338
- We can't go on.

250
00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:43.443
- Baby. you tripping.

251
00:13:43.443 --> 00:13:45.272
- We must forfeit.

252
00:13:45.272 --> 00:13:47.343
- Well. we're going. all right?

253
00:13:47.343 --> 00:13:49.898
You think you're some
posh motherfucking chef?

254
00:13:49.898 --> 00:13:51.071
Well. then. prove it.

255
00:13:51.071 --> 00:13:53.833
- We are not serving
farty cowboys.

256
00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:58.458
- Somehow. some way. make
it happen crowd mouth.

257
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.048
- Where did you go?

258
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:26.555
- It's pretty fancy. huh?

259
00:14:26.555 --> 00:14:27.521
- It's nice as heck.

260
00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:29.938
- Now what?

261
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.423
- Oh. I think we are supposed

262
00:14:32.423 --> 00:14:34.839
to put it on the table. okay.

263
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.738
1. 2. 3.
- 1. 2. 3.

264
00:14:43.296 --> 00:14:45.850
- Oh. I can smell it.

265
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:46.920
It smells good. huh?

266
00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:49.819
- Almost.

267
00:14:52.305 --> 00:14:53.237
Top off.

268
00:14:55.411 --> 00:14:56.378
- Vanessa.

269
00:14:57.724 --> 00:14:58.725
- Idiot. she means this.

270
00:15:07.976 --> 00:15:10.219
- What the hell is that?

271
00:15:10.219 --> 00:15:12.428
- It looks like
beanie weenie to me.

272
00:15:12.428 --> 00:15:16.605
- That's not a French
dish. I can't pronounce.

273
00:15:20.436 --> 00:15:21.575
Sal. Sal...

274
00:15:29.307 --> 00:15:31.137
What the hell
happened. fuck dude.

275
00:15:31.137 --> 00:15:34.692
- You will address me as
chef dude. I earned it.

276
00:15:34.692 --> 00:15:37.729
- You've earned a
boot of your nut sack.

277
00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:39.559
is what you've earned.

278
00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:40.801
- You trusted in me.

279
00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:42.320
- You will. this is
no time for jokes.

280
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.944
- I assure you this is
knock. knock. knock.

281
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.463
- Ebee. please explain.

282
00:15:47.463 --> 00:15:48.706
- You didn't place

283
00:15:48.706 --> 00:15:50.259
the motherfucking food
order motherfucker.

284
00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:51.951
- I thought you
were gonna do it.

285
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.954
- I was. but you said
you'd take care of it.

286
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.922
- I assumed you'd know I'd
mess it up and do it anyway.

287
00:15:57.922 --> 00:15:59.165
- Well. I tried to give

288
00:15:59.165 --> 00:16:01.512
your dumb ass the
benefit of the doubt.

289
00:16:01.512 --> 00:16:02.444
- So it's your fault.

290
00:16:02.444 --> 00:16:04.273
- Not me. scrotum face.

291
00:16:04.273 --> 00:16:06.448
- What are we gonna do?

292
00:16:06.448 --> 00:16:08.622
We're opening soon. proto.

293
00:16:11.073 --> 00:16:13.834
- We don't have time to
hit the grocery store.

294
00:16:13.834 --> 00:16:15.250
and there's no time to order in.

295
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.943
- We can't close. all
the VIPs will be here.

296
00:16:20.634 --> 00:16:22.015
Oh geez. Louise.

297
00:16:25.674 --> 00:16:26.640
- You know. maybe...

298
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.572
- Get your...

299
00:16:29.885 --> 00:16:32.853
Oh just show me a sign that
everything's gonna be alright.

300
00:16:37.927 --> 00:16:40.206
Oh don't show me a sign that
everything will be okay.

301
00:16:50.526 --> 00:16:51.976
You have a plan?

302
00:16:51.976 --> 00:16:55.117
- We must make do with the
beans on the French .

303
00:16:55.117 --> 00:16:57.361
- Don't worry your old ass.

304
00:16:57.361 --> 00:16:59.673
Ebee's got a motherfucking plan.

305
00:16:59.673 --> 00:17:01.123
- I've heard that before.

306
00:17:01.123 --> 00:17:03.850
- Just run your show
and we'll run ours.

307
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.127
These will be the best beans

308
00:17:05.127 --> 00:17:07.440
and tiny dick sausages
they've ever eaten.

309
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.407
- My high standard indeed.

310
00:17:09.407 --> 00:17:10.926
- No. get out.

311
00:17:10.926 --> 00:17:12.065
we've got work to do.

312
00:17:14.964 --> 00:17:18.658
- He helps this. he helps
this. he helps this.

313
00:17:18.658 --> 00:17:21.178
Ebee. how are we
going to win this war?

314
00:17:21.178 --> 00:17:23.559
- White people don't
know how to eat anyhow.

315
00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:25.182
and that's a fact jerk.

316
00:17:25.182 --> 00:17:28.530
It's all about the picture.
or if it makes them happy.

317
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.671
- Yeah. but we are still working
with beans on

318
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:34.018
or not even the German
quality. I might add.

319
00:17:34.018 --> 00:17:35.537
I'm not happy.

320
00:17:37.573 --> 00:17:40.128
- Yeah. I got a
secret ingredient.

321
00:17:40.128 --> 00:17:42.371
It's a happy spice.

322
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:46.755
- .
sumac. .

323
00:17:46.755 --> 00:17:48.412
- Weed. motherfucker.

324
00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:53.624
- Lots and lots of exotic weed.

325
00:17:57.283 --> 00:17:58.353
- Cushy.

326
00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:03.151
- Phones down.

327
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.464
Phones down. please.

328
00:18:06.464 --> 00:18:08.363
Come on. this is important.

329
00:18:10.744 --> 00:18:12.056
Attention.

330
00:18:12.056 --> 00:18:12.953
- Oh I have ADDE.

331
00:18:12.953 --> 00:18:14.990
- Oh. I have ADHD.

332
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.097
- I mean. stand up
straight. arms to the side.

333
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:29.556
We must all adhere to the
exacting standards of the owner.

334
00:18:29.556 --> 00:18:31.282
the master of the restaurant.

335
00:18:31.282 --> 00:18:32.559
- Isn't that you?

336
00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:33.560
- Sure. it is.

337
00:18:35.355 --> 00:18:39.118
Our appearance must be as
meticulous as our food.

338
00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.534
and that's gone down the tube.

339
00:18:41.534 --> 00:18:43.156
So we have to look extra good.

340
00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:44.123
Nails.

341
00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:46.918
On point. smiles.

342
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:50.163
Outstanding.

343
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:52.683
Boobies.

344
00:18:53.546 --> 00:18:54.374
- No.

345
00:18:54.374 --> 00:18:55.410
- Worth the shot.

346
00:18:56.825 --> 00:18:57.895
Where's Tom?

347
00:18:57.895 --> 00:18:59.103
- Coming.

348
00:19:02.762 --> 00:19:05.592
- Wow.
- Oh. where'd you get that?

349
00:19:05.592 --> 00:19:07.215
- Just a little something
I threw together.

350
00:19:07.215 --> 00:19:08.250
Do you like it?

351
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.217
- Rabbit wanna grab it.

352
00:19:11.357 --> 00:19:12.599
- How about no.

353
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:18.053
- As you all know. this
is a big night for me.

354
00:19:18.053 --> 00:19:19.572
for all of us.

355
00:19:19.572 --> 00:19:21.539
I need this to work
for so many reasons.

356
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.163
- Beanie weenies.

357
00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.785
- Thanks for reminding me.

358
00:19:25.785 --> 00:19:29.375
The deck is clearly stacked
against me. food-wise.

359
00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:31.963
So it all comes down
to excellent service.

360
00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:33.275
That's where we'll win.

361
00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:36.968
Vanessa. Nicky.

362
00:19:38.211 --> 00:19:39.419
- Huh?

363
00:19:39.419 --> 00:19:41.456
- I'm screwed sideways
up the bean hole.

364
00:19:45.253 --> 00:19:46.875
It's time.

365
00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:48.117
- What's wrong.

366
00:19:48.117 --> 00:19:50.430
- Mother hovered in
a barb wire thong.

367
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.466
What am I gonna do?

368
00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.746
- Here's what you're gonna do.

369
00:19:55.746 --> 00:19:57.472
You're gonna pull up
your adult diapers.

370
00:19:57.472 --> 00:19:59.336
and then you're
just gonna go do it.

371
00:19:59.336 --> 00:20:00.302
- And then what?

372
00:20:00.302 --> 00:20:01.924
- And then do it again.

373
00:20:02.753 --> 00:20:03.685
- And then what?

374
00:20:03.685 --> 00:20:05.100
- Repeat as necessary.

375
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:05.928
- A little kiss?

376
00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:08.655
- Oh but don't do that again.

377
00:20:09.863 --> 00:20:11.279
- Best pep dog never.

378
00:20:12.521 --> 00:20:14.385
Rabbit's got this.

379
00:20:14.385 --> 00:20:16.801
It's the moment of truth.

380
00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:18.424
Little drum roll please.

381
00:20:23.291 --> 00:20:24.913
And here we go.

382
00:20:28.986 --> 00:20:32.196
- Oh. I'm really not
good with word scrambles.

383
00:20:32.196 --> 00:20:33.128
...

384
00:20:34.854 --> 00:20:35.855
I don't get it.

385
00:20:35.855 --> 00:20:37.374
- Lelapin Haut.

386
00:20:38.478 --> 00:20:39.721
It means a high rabbit.

387
00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:41.309
- Catchy.

388
00:20:41.309 --> 00:20:44.450
- Because we serve
high cuisine and such.

389
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.486
- And shouldn't it be
called Rabbit's bean hole?

390
00:20:47.798 --> 00:20:50.456
- Nobody wants to eat that.

391
00:20:50.456 --> 00:20:51.974
- You said it.

392
00:20:51.974 --> 00:20:54.770
- Just open the
door. Major Double D.

393
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.048
- Major D.

394
00:21:17.828 --> 00:21:20.279
- Wow. it's right across
the street from Gucci.

395
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.349
- Isn't that so cute.

396
00:21:23.627 --> 00:21:24.559
- Hi.

397
00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:26.492
- Oh. I love it.
- Hi.

398
00:21:26.492 --> 00:21:27.734
Oh. get one. get one.

399
00:21:27.734 --> 00:21:28.563
There you go.

400
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.739
- Did you guys come
in here on purpose?

401
00:21:32.739 --> 00:21:33.740
- Yeah. of course.

402
00:21:36.156 --> 00:21:36.950
- Is someone chasing you?

403
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.227
Should I call the feds?

404
00:21:38.227 --> 00:21:39.090
- We heard this is
the new hot shot.

405
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.540
- From who?

406
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.093
- Can you get us in or not?

407
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.026
- Lemme check.

408
00:21:45.442 --> 00:21:46.719
As luck would have it.

409
00:21:46.719 --> 00:21:48.859
I can squeeze you
in. but just barely.

410
00:21:48.859 --> 00:21:50.412
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

411
00:21:50.412 --> 00:21:51.862
- Don't push that button.

412
00:21:51.862 --> 00:21:53.242
- Why?

413
00:21:53.242 --> 00:21:54.347
- We got some suckers.

414
00:21:54.347 --> 00:21:55.348
I mean. diners.

415
00:21:57.592 --> 00:21:59.179
- Look alive everybody.

416
00:21:59.179 --> 00:22:00.836
- Back to your stations.

417
00:22:00.836 --> 00:22:02.631
- We're in business bitches.

418
00:22:13.055 --> 00:22:14.678
- Your server will be
right with you guys.

419
00:22:14.678 --> 00:22:15.644
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

420
00:22:17.543 --> 00:22:19.027
- It's so exciting.

421
00:22:20.718 --> 00:22:24.135
I think I'll frame their
money from the bill.

422
00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:25.240
first dollar from
the first customer.

423
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.655
- They're dining dashers.

424
00:22:26.655 --> 00:22:28.795
I know the type. I am one.

425
00:22:30.452 --> 00:22:31.695
- Where's Vanessa and Nikki?

426
00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:36.113
- Oh fuck. fuck. fuck.

427
00:22:37.425 --> 00:22:38.978
- That's okay. I'll do it.

428
00:22:40.462 --> 00:22:42.188
- I took the liberty of
making you some new menus.

429
00:22:42.188 --> 00:22:43.569
- Thank you very much.

430
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.229
- Oh. no.

431
00:22:49.229 --> 00:22:50.196
- It's gonna be okay.

432
00:22:50.196 --> 00:22:51.162
- Some shit gonna lit up seats.

433
00:22:53.337 --> 00:22:54.303
I'm so fucking high.

434
00:22:55.477 --> 00:22:57.168
- Good evening ladies.

435
00:22:57.168 --> 00:22:57.997
- Who are you?

436
00:22:57.997 --> 00:22:59.619
- My name is Rabbit.

437
00:22:59.619 --> 00:23:01.897
This is my establishment.

438
00:23:01.897 --> 00:23:05.142
Being you're our first customer.

439
00:23:05.142 --> 00:23:07.282
I thought I would
wait on you myself

440
00:23:07.282 --> 00:23:09.042
for excellent tip top service.

441
00:23:09.042 --> 00:23:10.147
- Aww. yay.

442
00:23:12.598 --> 00:23:13.426
- Get it?

443
00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:14.393
Tip top.

444
00:23:19.639 --> 00:23:22.228
- How did you get
this job again?

445
00:23:22.228 --> 00:23:23.471
- Maybe you don't get it.

446
00:23:23.471 --> 00:23:25.265
That's okay.

447
00:23:25.265 --> 00:23:26.646
What can I get you. ma'am?

448
00:23:26.646 --> 00:23:28.372
- I'll have the weenies
and beans please.

449
00:23:28.372 --> 00:23:30.616
- Oh. excellent choice.

450
00:23:30.616 --> 00:23:32.134
And for you young lady?

451
00:23:32.134 --> 00:23:35.828
- I think I'll have
the number one.

452
00:23:35.828 --> 00:23:39.279
- Oh. equally
scrumptious choice.

453
00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:43.352
- I can't decide between the
number one or the number two.

454
00:23:43.352 --> 00:23:46.079
- I assure you the
number two is just

455
00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:48.668
as excellent as the number one.

456
00:23:49.807 --> 00:23:51.257
- Okay. I'll get
the number two then.

457
00:23:51.257 --> 00:23:53.121
- Okay. excellent choice.

458
00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:54.950
I couldn't have
chosen better myself.

459
00:23:56.158 --> 00:23:58.091
- Wait. you didn't
write any of this down.

460
00:23:58.091 --> 00:23:59.023
- No need.

461
00:23:59.886 --> 00:24:00.646
- Ooh.

462
00:24:00.646 --> 00:24:01.578
- You're good.

463
00:24:03.096 --> 00:24:03.994
- You're pretty.

464
00:24:03.994 --> 00:24:05.236
- You're pretty.

465
00:24:05.236 --> 00:24:06.686
I'm gonna share
my tips with you.

466
00:24:06.686 --> 00:24:09.102
- Okay. I probably won't
share mine with you.

467
00:24:09.102 --> 00:24:09.931
- Okay.

468
00:24:11.104 --> 00:24:13.072
- Let me just get
this to the kitchen.

469
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:26.948
We got some. we got some.

470
00:24:26.948 --> 00:24:28.190
- Well. lay it on us.

471
00:24:29.226 --> 00:24:30.469
- What?

472
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:32.056
- The orders. what
are they getting?

473
00:24:32.056 --> 00:24:32.954
- I forget.

474
00:24:34.058 --> 00:24:35.439
- They only have the one thing.

475
00:24:35.439 --> 00:24:37.510
It's not what they
got. it's how many?

476
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.373
- 1. 2. 3.

477
00:24:39.547 --> 00:24:40.409
4. 5. 6.

478
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:43.792
- 6?

479
00:24:43.792 --> 00:24:44.966
Well. that's a great start.

480
00:24:44.966 --> 00:24:46.933
- No. it's three.

481
00:24:46.933 --> 00:24:48.763
- I just saw you count to six.

482
00:24:48.763 --> 00:24:52.663
- I was counting
boobies. three girls.

483
00:24:52.663 --> 00:24:56.391
six boobies as three girls
is three. three orders.

484
00:24:56.391 --> 00:24:58.876
- It must be that
new fucking meth.

485
00:24:58.876 --> 00:25:00.706
Then order up
three of that shit.

486
00:25:08.023 --> 00:25:08.955
- Is it ready?

487
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.269
- Yeah. we all go.

488
00:25:13.442 --> 00:25:14.927
- The hell we are.

489
00:25:14.927 --> 00:25:17.032
I haven't even checked the
dishes yet motherfucker.

490
00:25:17.032 --> 00:25:18.482
wink wink.

491
00:25:18.482 --> 00:25:22.590
- My plating standard is
above grade across the board.

492
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.696
- I must approve
all dishes. wink.

493
00:25:25.696 --> 00:25:29.873
leaving this wink kitchen
motherfucker. wink. wink.

494
00:25:29.873 --> 00:25:32.807
- Oh yeah. yeah. yeah. I see.

495
00:25:32.807 --> 00:25:35.188
- Are we ready or not?

496
00:25:35.188 --> 00:25:36.914
- Turn around Rabbit.

497
00:25:44.681 --> 00:25:46.096
- Good to go.

498
00:25:48.132 --> 00:25:49.858
Bon appetit. bitches.

499
00:25:51.204 --> 00:25:53.655
- You're acting very
sketchy for a legit business

500
00:25:53.655 --> 00:25:56.002
that isn't based on weed.

501
00:25:56.002 --> 00:25:58.280
Ladies dinner is served.

502
00:26:00.869 --> 00:26:02.181
Aren't you gonna taste it?

503
00:26:02.181 --> 00:26:04.459
- Oh. we don't
actually eat food.

504
00:26:04.459 --> 00:26:05.667
- Well...

505
00:26:05.667 --> 00:26:06.875
- Yeah. no. we just
take photos of it.

506
00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:09.602
- What do you mean.
you have to eat.

507
00:26:09.602 --> 00:26:11.673
- We just live off
supplements and brain water.

508
00:26:11.673 --> 00:26:14.469
- I'm not sure if
that's working.

509
00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:19.405
Here. now. let's do the
Rabbit .

510
00:26:20.993 --> 00:26:21.821
- Oh my God.

511
00:26:22.684 --> 00:26:23.547
- Wow.

512
00:26:29.795 --> 00:26:30.623
- Really?

513
00:26:30.623 --> 00:26:31.486
- Mmh.

514
00:26:31.486 --> 00:26:32.314
- Lemme try.

515
00:26:32.314 --> 00:26:33.937
- Yeah. it's so good.

516
00:26:37.423 --> 00:26:38.251
- So silly.

517
00:26:40.322 --> 00:26:42.704
- Oh my gosh. stop it.

518
00:26:42.704 --> 00:26:44.706
There's no way. that's so
much better than vitamins.

519
00:26:49.055 --> 00:26:49.884
- I know.

520
00:26:51.851 --> 00:26:52.818
- Oh my gosh.

521
00:26:57.167 --> 00:26:58.962
- I think they like it.

522
00:26:58.962 --> 00:27:00.135
- Is it getting hot in here?

523
00:27:00.135 --> 00:27:01.033
- Yeah.
- It is amazing.

524
00:27:01.033 --> 00:27:02.448
It is amazing.

525
00:27:11.422 --> 00:27:12.976
- Yes. yes. my God.

526
00:27:15.461 --> 00:27:17.325
Oh my God. anyone else
getting a little bit horny?

527
00:27:17.325 --> 00:27:18.222
- Oh yeah.

528
00:27:18.222 --> 00:27:19.465
- Maybe a lot of it.

529
00:27:20.293 --> 00:27:21.536
- Amazing.

530
00:27:21.536 --> 00:27:22.744
- I already put my
foot on side break.

531
00:27:25.574 --> 00:27:27.438
- Oh yeah.
- This beans are amazing.

532
00:27:32.685 --> 00:27:34.998
- We actually have customers.

533
00:27:34.998 --> 00:27:36.655
- They're all here
to support you.

534
00:27:38.242 --> 00:27:40.313
- I'm so happy.
I could kiss you.

535
00:27:41.556 --> 00:27:42.730
- Could you go back
to being sad then?

536
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:46.078
- I'd be so sad.
I'd wanna kiss you.

537
00:27:46.078 --> 00:27:48.045
- Be like me. feel nothing.

538
00:27:57.158 --> 00:27:59.747
- Well. thank you
for joining us.

00:36:35.641 --> 00:36:36.815

- Oh. and she's so much
better than our couch.

721
00:36:43.511 --> 00:36:46.549
- Does the red clash
with my pink though?

722
00:36:46.549 --> 00:36:47.377
- No.

723
00:36:47.377 --> 00:36:48.654

00:36:55.627 --> 00:36:56.662
- Oh my God. this

730
00:36:56.662 --> 00:36:57.939
- I know.

731
00:36:57.939 --> 00:36:59.182
Can you believe this
is really happening?

732
00:36:59.182 --> 00:37:01.564
- No. we haven't been
out since the pandemic.

733
00:37:01.564 --> 00:37:03.497
- Unless you count
deep space and...

734
00:37:03.497 --> 00:37:05.119
- No. no. no. we
don't mention that.

735
00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:07.432
I want that to be
like a distant memory.

736
00:37:07.432 --> 00:37:08.812
- Totally. totally. totally.

737
00:37:08.812 --> 00:37:11.677
It's been like two years
since we got dressed up.

738
00:37:11.677 --> 00:37:14.370
- Yeah. but admit it.
we always look fab.

739
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.785
- Okay. I admit it to the max.

740
00:37:17.269 --> 00:37:19.237
- And we didn't even put
on any pandemic weight.

741
00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:20.445
I mean. look at this dress.

742
00:37:20.445 --> 00:37:22.101
it fits me like it's a dream.

743
00:37:22.101 --> 00:37:24.069
- It's because all
we had to eat was

744
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:25.726
like gummy llamas and
the water.

745
00:37:25.726 --> 00:37:26.658
- Oh true.

746
00:37:26.658 --> 00:37:27.693
- But I got my coca boobs.

747
00:37:27.693 --> 00:37:29.074
- Yeah. you did.

748
00:37:29.074 --> 00:37:30.627
- I just have my COVID socks.

749
00:37:32.284 --> 00:37:33.181
Gotta keep a perky.

750
00:37:33.181 --> 00:37:34.113
- Good track.

751
00:37:42.087 --> 00:37:44.158
- So is this like
the new normal?

752
00:37:44.158 --> 00:37:46.712
- What. looking cute in
chewing and doing?

753
00:37:46.712 --> 00:37:48.404
It's always been our normal.

00:37:49.715 --> 00:37:51.234
- say high five.
- Say high five.

755
00:37:51.234 --> 00:37:52.166
Wait.

00:37:52.166 --> 00:37:54.272
can we do this in real life now?

757
00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:56.412
- I mean. I think so.

758
00:37:56.412 --> 00:37:58.276
But it'd like so weird.

759
00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:00.347
- Yeah. I haven't
touched another person
in like two years.

760
00:38:00.347 --> 00:38:01.486
- Why your face?

761
00:38:01.486 --> 00:38:03.177
You were like totally
all over that.

762
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:06.663
- Oh. that was not personal.

763
00:38:06.663 --> 00:38:08.078
that was called essential work.

764
00:38:08.078 --> 00:38:08.907
- Okay.

765
00:38:08.907 --> 00:38:09.839
- Okay.

00:38:14.222 --> 00:38:15.085

00:38:29.237 --> 00:38:30.169
- It's him. it's him.

775
00:38:31.378 --> 00:38:33.311
- It really is him.

776
00:38:34.967 --> 00:38:37.798
Oh what. he's like so
much taller than on TV.

777
00:38:37.798 --> 00:38:40.801
- Yeah. that's because it
was only a 32-inch TV. duh.

778
00:38:43.182 --> 00:38:45.323
He's like so much
hotter than on Zoom.

779
00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:46.945
- Oh so much way hotter.

780
00:38:46.945 --> 00:38:48.326
- Thanks.

781
00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:50.431
- Did he hear us?

782
00:38:50.431 --> 00:38:52.709
- I don't know. are we live?

783
00:38:52.709 --> 00:38:53.641

00:38:54.608 --> 00:38:55.436

- I like totally dunno how to
navigate real life anymore.

788
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:03.341
- No.

789
00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:04.652
- Do you mind if I sit down?

790
00:39:04.652 --> 00:39:05.929
I can't seem to find my party.

- Been great. just
babysitting cats.

807
00:39:36.408 --> 00:39:37.892
- Babysitting cats.

808
00:39:37.892 --> 00:39:39.066
- I still have
that passion. yeah.

809
00:39:39.066 --> 00:39:40.343

810
00:39:40.343 --> 00:39:44.071

drive and race cars?

00:39:44.071 --> 00:39:46.004
- I do. I have modified that.

812
00:39:46.004 --> 00:39:47.212
I have to guy drive.

813
00:39:47.212 --> 00:39:48.800
but I drive a race
car in a lower class.

814
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.215
yeah.
- Oh wow.

815
00:39:50.215 --> 00:39:51.354
- And that's amazing.

816
00:39:51.354 --> 00:39:52.493
- Coolest thing ever.

817
00:39:52.493 --> 00:39:53.425
- That's sexy.
- I've had

818
00:39:53.425 --> 00:39:54.909
that passion before cats.

819
00:39:54.909 --> 00:39:56.117
I've actually been racing
for many. many years.

820
00:39:56.117 --> 00:39:56.946
- Seriously?

821
00:39:56.946 --> 00:39:57.774
- Yeah.

822
00:39:57.774 --> 00:39:58.603
- Wow.

823
00:39:58.603 --> 00:39:59.535
- Yeah.

824
00:39:59.535 --> 00:40:00.467
- How did you get into that?

825
00:40:00.467 --> 00:40:02.020
- Just had to stay alive.

826
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.160
You gotta find things for
habits to keep you alive.

827
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.610
and racing was it.

828
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:08.406
I was at a point in my life
where everything was depressing.

829
00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:09.268
nothing worked.

830
00:40:09.268 --> 00:40:11.201
I couldn't do nothing.

831
00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:13.997
and bam. I found racing
and loved it ever since.

832
00:40:13.997 --> 00:40:15.585
- Wow.
- So cool.

833
00:40:15.585 --> 00:40:17.725
- Yeah. some people can't
believe I can drive like this.

834
00:40:17.725 --> 00:40:18.554
I do.

835
00:40:18.554 --> 00:40:19.486
- You're like amazing.

836
00:40:19.486 --> 00:40:20.694
You're so amazing.

837
00:40:20.694 --> 00:40:21.626
- I don't know
about that. but...

838
00:40:21.626 --> 00:40:22.454
- It's cool.

839
00:40:22.454 --> 00:40:23.421
- I never give up.

840
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:24.698
- So how's Joey .

841
00:40:24.698 --> 00:40:26.424
- He's hanging in there.

842
00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:28.909
He's had some issues. he's
been in solitary a lot.

843
00:40:28.909 --> 00:40:31.877
but he's never seen the whole
version of tiger come in.

844
00:40:31.877 --> 00:40:33.154
- What?
- What?

845
00:40:33.154 --> 00:40:34.639
- Yeah. yeah. they
keep him locked up

846
00:40:34.639 --> 00:40:37.020
in solitary quite a bit
'cause of popularity.

847
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.263
- Oh my gosh.

848
00:40:38.263 --> 00:40:39.575
but good thing he
looks good in orange.

849
00:40:39.575 --> 00:40:40.438
- Yeah.

850
00:40:41.266 --> 00:40:42.543
- So I have to ask this

851
00:40:42.543 --> 00:40:44.096
and I'm sure everybody
asked you this.

852
00:40:44.096 --> 00:40:46.444
but what was up with the
fire. and who did it?

853
00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:48.169
- Oh my gosh. in
the first episode

854
00:40:48.169 --> 00:40:52.001
there's a producer on
there and his name's Kirk.

855
00:40:52.001 --> 00:40:54.417
and we have video
footage of him going

856
00:40:54.417 --> 00:40:55.936
in front of the office
at the same time

857
00:40:55.936 --> 00:40:58.939
that the fire was at night.
like four in the morning.

858
00:40:58.939 --> 00:41:00.596
And he's walking in
front of the cameras.

859
00:41:00.596 --> 00:41:01.873
- What?

860
00:41:01.873 --> 00:41:02.805
- That seems like
proof right there.

861
00:41:02.805 --> 00:41:03.978
- No. he left the country.

862
00:41:03.978 --> 00:41:05.704
There's a whole safe missing.

863
00:41:05.704 --> 00:41:07.085
with hard drives in it.
and he left the country.

864
00:41:09.018 --> 00:41:10.468
- He fled.

865
00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:13.678
- To a country where he can't
be extradited back so...

866
00:41:13.678 --> 00:41:14.955
- Wait. there's a safe missing

867
00:41:14.955 --> 00:41:16.335
with stuff inside of it?
- There's a whole safe

868
00:41:16.335 --> 00:41:17.405
missing with footage.

869
00:41:17.405 --> 00:41:18.855
And he did a documentary.

870
00:41:18.855 --> 00:41:22.480
and some of that footage I
believe is on that documentary.

871
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.240
- Scandalous.

872
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.897
- So how about like.

873
00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.520
do you wanna tell
me a story about

874
00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.695
how Joey like banged
all those boys?

875
00:41:32.593 --> 00:41:34.699
- Oh yeah. we
called them puppies.

876
00:41:34.699 --> 00:41:35.907
- Puppies?

877
00:41:35.907 --> 00:41:37.840
- Puppies. like dogs.
- Yeah. like dogs.

878
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.393
- Wooden dogs?

879
00:41:39.393 --> 00:41:42.500
- Wooden dogs. it was usually
18-year olds to 19-year olds.

880
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.673
- Oh my gosh.

881
00:41:43.673 --> 00:41:44.950
- And we call them puppies

882
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.227
'cause we bring one
in the front door

883
00:41:46.227 --> 00:41:47.712
and then one would be
going out the back door.

884
00:41:47.712 --> 00:41:48.954
So you gotta kind of sneak
them in and out so...

885
00:41:48.954 --> 00:41:50.093
- Oh my God.

886
00:41:50.093 --> 00:41:51.336
- What?
- So the other one

887
00:41:51.336 --> 00:41:52.579
don't know about
the other one. yeah.

888
00:41:52.579 --> 00:41:53.441
- Wait. he's going
out of his door?

889
00:41:53.441 --> 00:41:54.581
- No. the house door.

890
00:41:54.581 --> 00:41:55.582
- Okay.

891
00:41:55.582 --> 00:41:56.444
- Maybe his door.

892
00:41:57.273 --> 00:41:58.101
- Oh snap.

893
00:41:58.101 --> 00:41:58.930
- Yeah.
- Wow.

894
00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.138
- TMI for me.

895
00:42:00.138 --> 00:42:01.346
- Yeah.

896
00:42:01.346 --> 00:42:02.002
- That sounds like your
room in high school.

897
00:42:05.246 --> 00:42:06.178
- TMI.

898
00:42:14.497 --> 00:42:16.085
- What the fuck are
you looking for?

899
00:42:16.085 --> 00:42:17.638
You're missing bones?

900
00:42:17.638 --> 00:42:19.157
- My lucky watch. it's gone.

901
00:42:20.641 --> 00:42:22.919
- You don't need
that motherfucker.

902
00:42:22.919 --> 00:42:27.061
- My hand is for
reserved. I cannot go on.

903
00:42:27.061 --> 00:42:28.718
- Would you just
chill the fuck out

904
00:42:28.718 --> 00:42:30.513
and relax for a
motherfucking minute?

905
00:42:30.513 --> 00:42:32.342
- It is impossible.

906
00:42:32.342 --> 00:42:35.138
- The magic was
in you all along.

907
00:42:35.138 --> 00:42:37.037
not some motherfucking clock.

908
00:42:37.037 --> 00:42:38.728
- You think so?

909
00:42:38.728 --> 00:42:42.076
- Oh I know so. just
relax and breathe.

910
00:42:49.221 --> 00:42:50.498
Oh maybe the fuck nah.

911
00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:04.858
- Here you go.

912
00:43:08.137 --> 00:43:10.208
- You're shitting me. right?

913
00:43:10.208 --> 00:43:11.899
- What now?

914
00:43:11.899 --> 00:43:13.798
- This doesn't look
like the picture.

915
00:43:13.798 --> 00:43:15.903
- We don't have pictures.

916
00:43:15.903 --> 00:43:17.733
- Then you changed it. okay?

917
00:43:17.733 --> 00:43:20.494
I've seen better
food at the zoo.

918
00:43:20.494 --> 00:43:22.738
- From the hippo den. I presume.

919
00:43:23.635 --> 00:43:24.602
- What?

920
00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:26.051
Get your manager.

921
00:43:26.051 --> 00:43:27.846
- I am the manager.

922
00:43:27.846 --> 00:43:28.882
- I know the owner.

923
00:43:28.882 --> 00:43:30.711
- Boom. I'm the owner.

924
00:43:34.335 --> 00:43:36.199
- I could have got this
cheaper down the street.

925
00:43:36.199 --> 00:43:37.580
you kidding me?

926
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.961
- Then why don't you do that?

927
00:43:40.238 --> 00:43:42.723
Look. lady. there it
is. if you like it.

928
00:43:42.723 --> 00:43:44.380
and there it is. if you don't.

929
00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.485
- Well. I'll never. okay?

930
00:43:47.314 --> 00:43:49.005
- That's obvious.

931
00:43:49.005 --> 00:43:51.042
Pay up. leave a nice tip

932
00:43:51.042 --> 00:43:53.631
for the lady you
insulted or wear it.

933
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:55.287
- I'm not paying for this.

934
00:43:55.287 --> 00:43:57.393
- Well. you've made your choice.

935
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.089
- I am never coming here again.

936
00:44:07.161 --> 00:44:09.957
- That's the most reasonable
thing you've said all night.

937
00:44:13.236 --> 00:44:14.065
- Rabbit.

938
00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:21.141
- I've dealt with pissed
off bombs and sexy hell.

939
00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:24.109
have been covered
in alien splooge.

940
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:27.665
but nothing could
prepare me for a Karen.

941
00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:30.460
- Yeah. Rabbit. push
that motherfucker.

942
00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.911
Push it. push it real good.

943
00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:35.086
then I'll be running
this restaurant

944
00:44:35.086 --> 00:44:37.260
right into the
motherfucking ground.

945
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.572
- You're right.

946
00:44:38.572 --> 00:44:39.953
I can't do it.

947
00:44:39.953 --> 00:44:42.162
There's too much
right to go on this.

948
00:44:42.162 --> 00:44:43.611
Thank you. Ebee.

949
00:44:43.611 --> 00:44:46.338
- Fuck. did I just say
that shit out loud?

950
00:44:46.338 --> 00:44:48.168
I thought I was just
thinking that motherfucker.

951
00:44:48.168 --> 00:44:50.032
- I know you have
definitely projected that.

952
00:44:50.032 --> 00:44:54.588
- Well. goddamn. we'll project
your on those beans weenie.

953
00:44:56.797 --> 00:44:58.040
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

954
00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.110
and we definitely
have to do it again.

955
00:44:59.110 --> 00:44:59.904
- I know. it's so fun.
- Cheers.

956
00:45:01.975 --> 00:45:02.941
- Oh my gosh. I got my
fringe in your beans.

957
00:45:04.736 --> 00:45:06.358
The fringy beans?

958
00:45:06.358 --> 00:45:07.428
- Is that the bill?

959
00:45:07.428 --> 00:45:09.051
- Yes it is. and it's no hurry.

960
00:45:09.051 --> 00:45:11.743
And I really appreciate
you supporting me today.

961
00:45:11.743 --> 00:45:12.744
I really do.
- Let me get that.

962
00:45:12.744 --> 00:45:13.745
- Oh.
- Oh no.

963
00:45:13.745 --> 00:45:14.781
- It's on us.

964
00:45:14.781 --> 00:45:15.989
- Yeah. we totally got it.

965
00:45:15.989 --> 00:45:18.577
- Would this be
cash. ass or grass?

966
00:45:18.577 --> 00:45:21.615
But no grass. I'm
legitimate now.

967
00:45:21.615 --> 00:45:25.205
- Just lemme dig in my
purse and find my wallet.

968
00:45:25.205 --> 00:45:26.620
right. Kendra. my wallet.

969
00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:28.691
- Oh yeah.

970
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:31.245
- Okay. grab my hands.

971
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:37.976
- What the hell was that?

972
00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:40.807
Some kind of flashback?

973
00:45:52.611 --> 00:45:53.543
- Hey.

974
00:45:55.269 --> 00:45:57.824
- Hi. you have to excuse me.

975
00:45:57.824 --> 00:45:59.895
It's not every day a fellow sees

976
00:45:59.895 --> 00:46:02.690
such a beautiful. sensuous
woman like yourself.

977
00:46:09.456 --> 00:46:11.285
Where's my manners?

978
00:46:11.285 --> 00:46:12.700
I'm rabbit.

979
00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.151
- I know. we've met.

980
00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:18.396
I'm still Rhonda Vu.

981
00:46:19.742 --> 00:46:20.985
- Oh Rhonda Vu.

982
00:46:23.677 --> 00:46:25.023
how's it hanging?

983
00:46:25.023 --> 00:46:26.853
- Low. and to the left.

984
00:46:31.133 --> 00:46:35.378
You and I never finished
what we started in Vegas.

985
00:46:35.378 --> 00:46:36.379
- We didn't?

986
00:46:38.209 --> 00:46:39.210
Why is that?

987
00:46:40.314 --> 00:46:42.075
- Because you ran off

988
00:46:44.318 --> 00:46:47.459
screaming like a little bitch.

989
00:46:49.945 --> 00:46:50.877
- I did?

990
00:46:52.119 --> 00:46:54.466
But we had a heck of
a conversation. right?

991
00:46:56.814 --> 00:46:57.642
- Oh.

992
00:47:02.405 --> 00:47:05.339
- Does this still bother you?

993
00:47:05.339 --> 00:47:07.686
- Who cares. it's just skin.

994
00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:27.016
- Enjoy.

995
00:47:29.087 --> 00:47:30.019
- Oh thanks.

996
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.991
Oh dude. it looks
so yummilicious.

997
00:47:36.888 --> 00:47:39.373
- Oh completely suckerlicious.

998
00:47:41.444 --> 00:47:42.480
Let's dig in.

999
00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.446
- I did that.

1000
00:47:51.316 --> 00:47:53.422
Oh I can almost taste it.

1001
00:47:54.941 --> 00:47:56.183
- Yeah. almost.

1002
00:47:57.633 --> 00:47:59.462
It's like as close as
we're gonna get. bro.

1003
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:01.879
- Hummer. dude.

1004
00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:03.432
- We're in gnarly.

1005
00:48:03.432 --> 00:48:06.021
- Well. how about like a toast?

1006
00:48:07.954 --> 00:48:08.851
- Oh.

1007
00:48:12.165 --> 00:48:14.029
- Hi.
- You can call.

1008
00:48:21.381 --> 00:48:22.727
- I don't know about you.

1009
00:48:22.727 --> 00:48:24.729
but I'd let him possess
this pussy any day.

1010
00:48:26.973 --> 00:48:28.526
- This totally sucks.

1011
00:48:28.526 --> 00:48:32.910
- Being a ghost is just
like all one big suck.

1012
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:36.844
Bro. it was a total
ghostly toast as bros. bro.

1013
00:48:38.398 --> 00:48:39.778
- You took the words
right outta my mouth.

1014
00:48:42.264 --> 00:48:43.713
At least it still smells good.

1015
00:48:45.163 --> 00:48:46.095
- You can smell it?

1016
00:48:48.442 --> 00:48:49.547
- A ghost can dream.

1017
00:48:50.582 --> 00:48:51.411
- Yeah.

1018
00:48:51.411 --> 00:48:52.481
- A ghost can dream.

1019
00:49:07.427 --> 00:49:09.049
- Somebody left their food.

1020
00:49:24.547 --> 00:49:26.411
- What the heck was that?

1021
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:28.896
- Sexy hell. they must
have ordered to go.

1022
00:49:33.487 --> 00:49:34.316
- Sal.

1023
00:49:34.316 --> 00:49:36.076
- .

1024
00:49:38.009 --> 00:49:41.771
Ebee. we've been through a
lot of rough years together.

1025
00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:44.395
but you really pulled
through for me tonight.

1026
00:49:44.395 --> 00:49:46.086
I wanna thank you.

1027
00:49:46.086 --> 00:49:48.123
- Well. about fucking time.

1028
00:49:48.123 --> 00:49:52.265
- Going legit was the
best decision I ever made.

1029
00:49:52.265 --> 00:49:55.785
- Well. I can't believe I'm
saying this. but congrats.

1030
00:49:55.785 --> 00:49:58.823
You deserve everything
you get. dick face.

1031
00:49:58.823 --> 00:50:01.377
- I do deserve everything
I get. don't I?

1032
00:50:01.377 --> 00:50:03.655
- Everything. motherfucker.

1033
00:50:04.794 --> 00:50:07.556
- I've been so busy.
I'm a bit .

1034
00:50:07.556 --> 00:50:09.765
I haven't even
tasted the food. Sal?

1035
00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:16.979
- Oh.

1036
00:50:22.088 --> 00:50:23.779
Weed. glory is weed.

1037
00:50:27.058 --> 00:50:28.611
- That's right.

1038
00:50:28.611 --> 00:50:31.304
You thought you could make
it without me and my weed.

1039
00:50:31.304 --> 00:50:33.996
You thought wrong. motherfucker.

1040
00:50:33.996 --> 00:50:35.239
You're nothing without Ebee.

1041
00:50:35.239 --> 00:50:36.516
- How could you?

1042
00:50:36.516 --> 00:50:38.345
This is my one chance.

1043
00:50:38.345 --> 00:50:41.659
- And you won
motherfucker. be grateful.

1044
00:50:43.247 --> 00:50:44.869
- I'm just beside myself.

1045
00:50:47.285 --> 00:50:48.286
- Oh. yes.

1046
00:50:53.602 --> 00:50:55.845
- I gotta say. you
really pulled it off.

1047
00:50:57.088 --> 00:50:58.055
- I did?

1048
00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:00.298
- There he is.

1049
00:51:00.298 --> 00:51:01.299
There's the jerk.

1050
00:51:04.509 --> 00:51:05.717
- Keep it still in the bathroom.

1051
00:51:05.717 --> 00:51:06.649
- Oh my gosh. she's
gonna see this?

1052
00:51:07.857 --> 00:51:09.721
- What seems to be
the problem officers?

1053
00:51:09.721 --> 00:51:12.172
- This lady with nothing
else going on in her life

1054
00:51:12.172 --> 00:51:14.416
has filed a report against
this establishment.

1055
00:51:14.416 --> 00:51:16.556
- I want him fired.

1056
00:51:16.556 --> 00:51:20.146
- You can't fire me. I
own this establishment.

1057
00:51:20.146 --> 00:51:22.562
- Sir. now that I
look around myself.

1058
00:51:22.562 --> 00:51:24.391
there is some merit
to what she's told us.

1059
00:51:25.979 --> 00:51:27.946
- Are you running some kind
of house of ill repute?

1060
00:51:27.946 --> 00:51:30.156
- Oh no. they're just high.

1061
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:33.780
- Say it again. sir.

1062
00:51:34.781 --> 00:51:35.678
- No.

1063
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:39.234
Oh. here. try some
of our fine cuisine.

1064
00:51:39.234 --> 00:51:40.097
I think you'll love it.

1065
00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:46.241
- That's my high
grade local. try it.

1066
00:51:49.244 --> 00:51:50.659
- Jam. that's good shit.

1067
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:55.284
But still you're going
to have to come with us.

1068
00:51:55.284 --> 00:51:57.217

existed in the first place?

1126

You're just a figment of
my imagination this time.

1127
00:56:03.256 --> 00:56:06.086
We're all just one bad
motherfucking tree.

1128
00:56:08.744 --> 00:56:09.676

It looks like we missed
all the fun though.

1134
00:56:40.811 --> 00:56:41.812
- Oh shit.

1135
00:56:42.744 --> 00:56:44.918
All dressed up no place to go.
