00:32:12.683 --> 00:32:15.227
<i>Becki gives me a call saying.
"Hey. do you wanna meet Donald Trump?"</i>

654
00:32:15.227 --> 00:32:17.688
<i>'Cause at the time.
he wasn't who he is today.</i>

655
00:32:17.688 --> 00:32:21.483
<i>He wasn't running for president.
He was just the star on</i> The Apprentice.

656
00:32:21.483 --> 00:32:23.569
<i>They knew that I liked Donald Trump.</i>

657
00:32:23.569 --> 00:32:25.863
<i>that I read his book.</i> The Art of the Deal.

658
00:32:25.863 --> 00:32:27.948
LILIA:
<i>My brother loved business</i>

659
00:32:27.948 --> 00:32:30.617
and thought Donald Trump was great.
and so he was like--

660
00:32:30.617 --> 00:32:31.618
- Yeah. absolutely!

661
00:32:32.744 --> 00:32:34.705
MARK:
<i>They were bringing him into a world</i>

662
00:32:34.705 --> 00:32:37.040
<i>that he couldn't even imagine.</i>

663
00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.962
<i>"Real estate. politics.
my future. everything is here."</i>

664
00:32:42.546 --> 00:32:45.465
<i>He had never in his life imagined</i>

665
00:32:45.465 --> 00:32:49.344
<i>being able to be allowed entrée
into that world.</i>

666
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:54.391
<i>I paid
for the ticket from Miami to Lynchburg.</i>

667
00:32:54.391 --> 00:32:55.976
<i>then they put me at a hotel.</i>

668
00:32:55.976 --> 00:32:58.312
But after a day. they're like. "Hey.
you don't need to stay there actually.

669
00:32:58.312 --> 00:33:00.105
Just come stay with us at our house."

670
00:33:00.731 --> 00:33:03.025
<i>It was the first time
that I met their kids.</i>

671
00:33:03.025 --> 00:33:05.277
<i>I don't think they suspected anything
at the moment.</i>

672
00:33:05.277 --> 00:33:08.488
Jerry and Becki did tell the kids
they were helping me out.

673
00:33:08.488 --> 00:33:12.242
that they wanna give me
the opportunity to rise within business.

674
00:33:12.659 --> 00:33:16.371
<i>Jerry was the leader
of this Christian university.</i>

675
00:33:16.371 --> 00:33:18.707
<i>so they're around young adults.</i>

676
00:33:19.374 --> 00:33:20.501
It's actually pretty reasonable.

677
00:33:20.501 --> 00:33:23.128
No one really asked why I was around.

678
00:33:23.128 --> 00:33:24.963
I just kind of blended right in.

679
00:33:26.423 --> 00:33:27.716
<i>I was kind of expecting</i>

680
00:33:27.716 --> 00:33:31.220
<i>this weird Bible college
in the middle of nowhere.</i>

681
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.389
<i>but Liberty University is one
of the nicest campuses I've seen.</i>

682
00:33:35.641 --> 00:33:36.975
<i>Jerry was very proud.</i>

683
00:33:36.975 --> 00:33:40.562
<i>and he mentioned that the endowment
was about two billion dollars.</i>

684
00:33:41.188 --> 00:33:45.234
<i>Coming from Miami where you have
people from all parts of the world.</i>

685
00:33:45.234 --> 00:33:46.485
<i>it's a melting pot.</i>

686
00:33:46.485 --> 00:33:50.739
<i>but what I did notice at Liberty.
there weren't many Black students.</i>

687
00:33:50.739 --> 00:33:53.325
<i>It was mostly white evangelicals.</i>

688
00:33:55.536 --> 00:33:58.830
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: <i>Today.
I want to say to the people of America</i>

689
00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.457
<i>and the nations of the world.</i>

690
00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:03.418
we are not about to turn around.

691
00:34:04.586 --> 00:34:05.921
We are on the move now.

692
00:34:07.172 --> 00:34:10.926
<i>Yes. we are on the move.
and no wave of racism can stop us.</i>

693
00:34:12.678 --> 00:34:17.432
- March 1965 is a big turning point
for many white evangelical pastors

694
00:34:17.432 --> 00:34:19.309
to understand that the world was changing.

695
00:34:19.309 --> 00:34:20.811
<i>They would have to consider</i>

696
00:34:20.811 --> 00:34:23.605
<i>what side of that world
that they wanted to be on.</i>

697
00:34:23.605 --> 00:34:27.025
<i>Would they be on the side
of the Civil Rights Movement.</i>

698
00:34:27.025 --> 00:34:29.778
or would they be on the side
of white supremacy?

699
00:34:29.778 --> 00:34:31.822
And Jerry Falwell Sr. made a choice.

700
00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:35.951
JERRY SR.:
<i>I remember preaching a sermon
justifying the segregationist position.</i>

701
00:34:36.535 --> 00:34:39.204
One can make the Bible say almost anything
he wants to make it say.

702
00:34:39.204 --> 00:34:41.582
- Our God is marching on.

703
00:34:41.582 --> 00:34:43.542
Glory hallelujah!

704
00:34:44.084 --> 00:34:45.836
Glory hallelujah!

705
00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.255
Glory hallelujah!

706
00:34:49.756 --> 00:34:54.219
- Jerry Falwell Sr. says that ministers
should not be involved in the political.

707
00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:58.140
they should only be involved
in preaching the Gospel of Jesus.

708
00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.434
<i>But later on. his game had changed.</i>

709
00:35:01.602 --> 00:35:04.104
REPORTER:
<i>School districts began desegregating today</i>

710
00:35:04.104 --> 00:35:05.564
<i>under Supreme Court orders.</i>

711
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.442
- Jerry Falwell Sr. was not happy

712
00:35:08.442 --> 00:35:11.737
about the <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>
decision.

713
00:35:11.737 --> 00:35:13.530
- But as the public schools reopen.

714
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:17.910
<i>a number of new private schools.
all white. sprang into existence.</i>

715
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.245
- He started his own
segregation academy there

716
00:35:20.245 --> 00:35:22.748
in conjunction with
the Thomas Road Baptist Church.

717
00:35:23.707 --> 00:35:26.460
- These segregation academies
were not called segregation academies.

718
00:35:26.877 --> 00:35:28.504
<i>They had Christian names.</i>

719
00:35:28.504 --> 00:35:30.422
<i>But they were built to make sure</i>

720
00:35:30.422 --> 00:35:35.344
<i>that white children did not have to be
in contact with African American children.</i>

721
00:35:35.344 --> 00:35:39.264
- The IRS wants to revoke
the tax exemptions for private schools

722
00:35:39.264 --> 00:35:42.601
which discriminate racially
in their admissions policies.

723
00:35:42.601 --> 00:35:45.145
MATTHEW SUTTON:
<i>In the 1970s. the IRS determines</i>

724
00:35:45.145 --> 00:35:48.315
that if you were
a charitable institution by definition.

725
00:35:48.315 --> 00:35:50.359
so it means you get tax exemption.

726
00:35:50.359 --> 00:35:52.027
you cannot practice segregation.

727
00:35:52.528 --> 00:35:56.073
<i>And one of the things they'd then target
are these Christian-segregated academies.</i>

728
00:35:57.074 --> 00:36:00.452
<i>So this really wakes up Falwell
and a number of other ministers.</i>

729
00:36:00.452 --> 00:36:03.455
and they realize that if they don't have
allies in the Federal Government.

730
00:36:03.455 --> 00:36:05.749
they're not gonna be able
to keep doing what they're trying to do.

We're citizens too.

735
00:36:13.715 --> 00:36:18.011
- He actually at least had the integrity
to acknowledge that he was a hypocrite.

736
00:36:18.011 --> 00:36:22.057
- Jerry Falwell Sr.'s idea
about ministers being involved in politics

737
00:36:22.057 --> 00:36:24.518
was to support the status quo
of white supremacy.

738
00:36:25.269 --> 00:36:28.188
- Falwell is really at the ground level
doing this through his school.

Why did he react that way?"

00:48:04.343 --> 00:48:06.678
LILIA:
<i>Pictures?</i> <i>Okay.</i>

981
00:48:06.678 --> 00:48:10.641
Like. pictures of you guys doing stuff?

982
00:48:11.058 --> 00:48:11.934
- Yeah.

983
00:48:11.934 --> 00:48:13.310
- Well. you're fucked.

984
00:48:14.811 --> 00:48:17.147
- I told Jerry. I'm like.
"Like. I didn't give it to them.

985
00:48:17.147 --> 00:48:19.066
They just somehow obtained them."

986
00:48:19.483 --> 00:48:22.611
<i>And Jerry's like. "Look. I trust you.
Don't even worry about it.</i>

987
00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:24.071
<i>I know we're all on the same team here."</i>

988
00:48:24.571 --> 00:48:26.406
I tell him. like.
"We need to call the FBI.

989
00:48:26.406 --> 00:48:28.033
"We shouldn't pay them.
you know. a penny."

990
00:48:28.367 --> 00:48:32.788
<i>But it seemed like Jerry. he never
really wanted to testify under oath.</i>

991
00:48:32.788 --> 00:48:34.122

992

<i>He knew the volatility in those photos.</i>

993
00:48:37.918 --> 00:48:43.465
<i>and he knew that they had something
that could literally destroy him.</i>

994
00:48:43.465 --> 00:48:45.884
<i>- I told Jerry. I'm like.
"What did you tell your attorneys?"</i>

995
00:48:45.884 --> 00:48:48.762
<i>And he's like. "Well. I told them
that you had a crush on Becki.</i>

996
00:48:48.762 --> 00:48:53.058
<i>and you somehow got. you know. the images.
and then your friends got it somehow."</i>

997
00:48:53.642 --> 00:48:55.519
I'm like. "Uh. that's not what happened."

998
00:48:55.936 --> 00:48:59.147
And at that point. I'm like.
"Is this-- Am I being represented here?

999

for my best interests

because. obviously. Jerry has influence.

00:49:05.988 --> 00:49:07.781
<i>He has power. He has connections.</i>

1003
00:49:08.448 --> 00:49:12.995

to just spin this to favor the Falwells.</i>

of the Fernandezes started getting real.

"Well. let me tell my parents

1008

And so they begin

1080
00:52:55.884 --> 00:52:58.971
- There was a kind of a period
of almost market testing

1081

these evangelical voters.

1085
00:53:09.273 --> 00:53:14.319
I don't believe we should demean womanhood
by saying that men and women are the same.

1086
00:53:14.319 --> 00:53:16.321

not the government.

by evangelicals in the 1970s.

1101

- Evangelicals really felt
like abortion was a personal decision

1102
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.495
that could be made
with a minister and a doctor.

1103

is the state telling people what to do.

they had an issue
that would work for them politically.

00:54:53.585 --> 00:54:57.339
- Jerry Falwell Sr. does not preach
his first sermon against abortion

1119

until five years after <i>Roe v. Wade.</i>

1120

JERRY SR.:
<i>Abortion is a moral issue.</i>

1121
00:55:01.927 --> 00:55:03.470
<i>It is a human rights issue.</i>

1127
00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:24.658
<i>to put himself in the forefront
of the culture wars of the day.</i>

1128
00:55:24.658 --> 00:55:27.953
<i>It's much easier
to say you don't want abortion</i>

1129
00:55:27.953 --> 00:55:30.831

1131

a very lucrative business proposition.</i>

1132

a dime. or a quarter.

No change left.

1135
00:55:43.177 --> 00:55:45.512

- All the moral issues that count today
are in the political arena.

1147
00:56:18.295 --> 00:56:21.256
There's no way to fight these battles
except in that arena.

1154

1155
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:42.277

President Falwell. everybody. Come on.

1169
00:57:24.528 --> 00:57:29.157
- Matthew 7:16 tells us
that by their fruits. you shall know them.

1170
00:57:29.157 --> 00:57:32.953
In my opinion. Donald Trump
lives a life of loving and helping others

1171
00:57:32.953 --> 00:57:35.163
as Jesus taught in the great commandment.

1172
00:57:35.163 --> 00:57:39.084
Please welcome back
to Liberty University. Mr. Donald Trump.

1173
00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:41.211
- Wow.

1174
00:57:43.046 --> 00:57:44.339
It's an honor to be here.

1175
00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.049
I wrote <i>The Art of the Deal.</i>

1176
00:57:46.049 --> 00:57:47.134
I wrote many bestsellers.

1177
00:57:47.134 --> 00:57:51.597
I always say.
a deep. deep second to the Bible.

1178
00:57:51.597 --> 00:57:53.265
The Bible is the best. The Bible.

1179
00:57:54.558 --> 00:57:57.352
GIANCARLO:
<i>Jerry was entrenched
in. now. the political world</i>

1180
00:57:57.352 --> 00:57:59.146
in campaigning for Donald Trump.

1181
00:57:59.146 --> 00:58:02.316
- Evangelicals are tired
of being betrayed.

1182
00:58:02.316 --> 00:58:05.944
<i>And I think the song from 1971 by The Who.</i>

1183
00:58:05.944 --> 00:58:10.324
Won't Get Fooled Again.
<i>is very pertinent in this situation.</i>

1184
00:58:10.324 --> 00:58:12.993
<i>And I think
that's how a lot of evangelicals feel.</i>

1185
00:58:13.744 --> 00:58:15.537
We don't wanna get fooled again.

1186
00:58:16.038 --> 00:58:19.249
DONALD:
<i>Jerry Falwell Jr. was so helpful.
He was so helpful.</i>

1187
00:58:19.249 --> 00:58:22.002
You know.
I'm leading with the evangelicals.

1188
00:58:22.002 --> 00:58:23.086
<i>I'm a good Christian.</i>

1189
00:58:23.086 --> 00:58:25.047
- The majority of evangelicals believe

1190
00:58:25.047 --> 00:58:27.758
that Donald Trump is best equipped
to save the country.

1191
00:58:27.758 --> 00:58:31.303
<i>He was one
of the very first Christian leaders</i>

1192
00:58:31.303 --> 00:58:33.639
who made it possible
for other Christian leaders

1193
00:58:33.639 --> 00:58:34.556
to get on board

1194
00:58:34.556 --> 00:58:36.683
and get their congregations on board
with the Trump campaign.

1195
00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.977
- The evangelicals. they're with me

1196
00:58:38.977 --> 00:58:41.063
'cause they know one thing about me.
I'm not a liar.

1197
00:58:41.063 --> 00:58:43.023
- Well. you just heard it
from Donald Trump.

1198
00:58:43.023 --> 00:58:44.650
Christians love him.

1199
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:46.485
<i>If Trump didn't get
into real estate development.</i>

1200
00:58:46.485 --> 00:58:48.695
he could've been an evangelical preacher.

1201
00:58:49.112 --> 00:58:51.031
- There's 15 devils.

1202
00:58:51.031 --> 00:58:52.491
GIANCARLO:
<i>And he's a character.</i>

1203
00:58:52.491 --> 00:58:54.993
<i>All these pastors. they're all characters.</i>

1204
00:58:54.993 --> 00:58:56.245
<i>they're putting on a show.</i>

1205
00:58:56.245 --> 00:58:57.788
- Everybody wants to talk about my hair.

1206
00:58:57.788 --> 00:59:00.374
- Maybe they don't like my hair.
which is real. by the way.

1207
00:59:00.374 --> 00:59:01.208
Look at that sucker.

1208
00:59:02.376 --> 00:59:04.086
RANDALL:
<i>You can make a case that Donald Trump</i>

1209
00:59:04.086 --> 00:59:07.339
<i>is very much in the tradition
of the televangelist.</i>

1210
00:59:07.339 --> 00:59:09.716
He was an evangelist for capitalism.

1211
00:59:10.217 --> 00:59:12.886
- Many of you would need
to anoint your billfold with this oil

1212
00:59:12.886 --> 00:59:14.096
for a financial blessing.

1213
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:17.224
DONALD:
<i>Trump Steaks are by far the best tasting.</i>

1214
00:59:17.224 --> 00:59:19.226
most flavorful beef you've ever had.

1215
00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:23.814
<i>And so. Donald Trump emerged
as the champion for the religious right.</i>

1216
00:59:23.814 --> 00:59:25.232
much like Reagan did in 1980.

1217
00:59:26.358 --> 00:59:29.069
RONALD REAGAN:
I was asked once what book I would choose

1218
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:30.988
if I were shipwrecked on an island.

1219
00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:32.322
The Bible.

1220
00:59:33.073 --> 00:59:35.409
RANDALL:
<i>What this is. is politics.</i>

1221
00:59:35.409 --> 00:59:36.785
<i>Politics in the pulpit.</i>

1222
00:59:36.785 --> 00:59:38.370
REPORTER:
<i>Few concern themselves</i>

1223
00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:41.456
<i>with the delicate balance
between church and state.</i>

1224
00:59:41.456 --> 00:59:43.500
JERRY SR.:
Mr. Reagan's enemies are my enemies.

1225
00:59:44.251 --> 00:59:45.294
and they're yours too.

1226
00:59:45.294 --> 00:59:48.839
- Donald Trump is the only candidate
who cannot be bought.

1227
00:59:49.631 --> 00:59:54.386
- I am the law and order candidate.

1228
00:59:54.386 --> 00:59:56.263
- You wanted law and order in this town.

1229
00:59:56.263 --> 00:59:57.389
<i>you've got it.</i>

1230
01:00:04.229 --> 01:00:06.940
- All of us are sinners.
All of us are redeemable.

1231
01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.317
- Falwell stood by his side

1232
01:00:08.317 --> 01:00:11.111
<i>and continued to argue
that Christians should support him.</i>

1233
01:00:11.111 --> 01:00:12.529
JERRY JR.:
<i>Five years from now.</i>

1234
01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:14.781
when the Supreme Court is stacked

1235
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:17.492
<i>with people who will rip
our Constitution to shreds.</i>

1236
01:00:17.492 --> 01:00:19.203
<i>get rid of the Second Amendment.</i>

1237
01:00:19.203 --> 01:00:21.580
nobody's gonna be thinking
about what Donald Trump said

1238
01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:23.790
on a videotape in 2005.

1239
01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:26.793
<i>Evangelicals didn't care
about Donald Trump not being Christian.</i>

1240
01:00:26.793 --> 01:00:30.130
<i>They were willing to take a man
who had been married three times</i>

1241
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:32.758
and had five children
from three different mothers.

1242
01:00:33.258 --> 01:00:36.553
<i>just like they didn't care
that Ronald Reagan wasn't evangelical.</i>

1243
01:00:37.304 --> 01:00:38.972
RANDALL:
<i>Here you have Jimmy Carter.</i>

1244
01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:43.519
<i>a born again.
Southern Baptist. progressive evangelical.</i>

1245
01:00:43.519 --> 01:00:46.980
And evangelicals.
they turned dramatically against him

1246
01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.107
<i>and then settled. improbably.</i>

1247
01:00:49.107 --> 01:00:54.404
<i>on a divorced and remarried.
former Hollywood actor.</i>

1248
01:00:54.404 --> 01:00:57.908
<i>who. as Governor of California in 1967.</i>

1249
01:00:57.908 --> 01:01:01.203
<i>signed into law the most liberal
abortion bill in the country.</i>

1250
01:01:01.203 --> 01:01:04.456
- When you interrupt a pregnancy.
you are taking a human life.

1251
01:01:04.957 --> 01:01:06.250
- As you know. I'm pro-life.

1252
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.210
INTERVIEWER:
<i>Should the woman be punished</i>

1253
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:09.211
<i>for having an abortion?</i>

1254
01:01:09.211 --> 01:01:11.004
- There has to be some form of punishment.

1255
01:01:11.004 --> 01:01:12.130
For the woman?
- Yeah.

1256
01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:14.341
- Moral Majority founder.
the Reverend Jerry Falwell

1257
01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:15.217
<i>is quoted as saying.</i>

1258
01:01:15.217 --> 01:01:18.512
he expects a reshaped Supreme Court
by President Reagan

1259
01:01:18.512 --> 01:01:20.305
would outlaw most abortions.

1260
01:01:20.305 --> 01:01:23.141
- Do you wanna see the Court
overturn <i>Roe v. Wade?</i>

1261
01:01:23.141 --> 01:01:26.520
- Well. if we put
another two or perhaps three justices on.

1262
01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.147
that's really what's going to be--
That will happen.

1263
01:01:29.147 --> 01:01:32.442
- Evangelicals.
all they wanted to do was win.

1264
01:01:32.442 --> 01:01:35.696
and they were willing to win
with anyone that they possibly could.

1265
01:01:35.696 --> 01:01:39.324
BOTH:
We will make America great again.

1266
01:01:39.324 --> 01:01:42.953
- In 1984. my father stood
at this convention

1267
01:01:43.537 --> 01:01:45.205
and offered the opening prayer

1268
01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:48.166
before our party's candidate.
Ronald Reagan.

1269
01:01:48.166 --> 01:01:49.710
- We pray for our beloved president.

1270
01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.546
Upon a man that many of us believe.

1271
01:01:52.546 --> 01:01:55.799
indeed. to be our greatest president
since Lincoln.

1272
01:01:57.342 --> 01:02:00.345
- Ronald Reagan went on
to accept the nomination

1273
01:02:00.345 --> 01:02:01.805
and win in a landslide.

1274
01:02:02.139 --> 01:02:04.266
A little over 30 years later.

1275
01:02:04.266 --> 01:02:07.352
I stand here with the sincerest prayer

1276
01:02:07.352 --> 01:02:12.149
that history is about to repeat itself
with the election of Donald J. Trump.

1277
01:02:17.863 --> 01:02:20.949
<i>Just about four days
before the Republican National Convention.</i>

1278
01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:22.868
<i>I received a text message from Jerry.</i>

1279
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:26.371
<i>He said that
"You have equity in the company.</i>

1280
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:29.249
<i>you've worked really hard
in maximizing the value of this company."</i>

1281
01:02:29.249 --> 01:02:30.292
No matter what happens.

1282
01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:33.128
whether he buys it out
or we sell the property.

1283
01:02:33.128 --> 01:02:36.507
that he would ensure
that I get no less than $600.000.

1284
01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:38.759
I was making it clear
that this legal dispute

1285
01:02:38.759 --> 01:02:41.637
was. you know.
taking a toll on my mental health.

1286
01:02:41.637 --> 01:02:43.514
I just wasn't feeling well. I wanted out.

1287
01:02:44.014 --> 01:02:45.891
<i>He probably wanted
a clean cut from everything too.</i>

1288
01:02:46.517 --> 01:02:50.896
<i>This was just another form
of trapping my brother in.</i>

1289
01:02:50.896 --> 01:02:53.106
giving him a reason
to. you know. stay close.

1290
01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:55.817
Now there was this whole new dynamic.

1291
01:02:55.817 --> 01:03:00.656
<i>Jerry Falwell was getting himself involved
with the future president of this country.</i>

1292
01:03:00.656 --> 01:03:03.825
<i>so he needed to make sure
that his circle was tight.</i>

1293
01:03:03.825 --> 01:03:08.372
and that no one was gonna be out there
saying anything crazy about them.

1294
01:03:09.456 --> 01:03:13.168
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Fox News decision desk has called</i>

1295
01:03:13.752 --> 01:03:15.838
<i>Pennsylvania for Donald Trump.</i>

1296
01:03:16.255 --> 01:03:19.466
<i>This means that Donald Trump will be</i>

1297
01:03:19.466 --> 01:03:23.136
<i>the 45th president of the United States.</i>

1298
01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:24.721
ANTHEA:
<i>Evangelicals have played a role</i>

1299
01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:28.308
<i>in electing every Republican president
since Ronald Reagan.</i>

1300
01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:30.227
NARRATOR:
<i>The numbers were overwhelming.</i>

1301
01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:34.064
<i>81% of self-identified white.
born again. or evangelical Christians</i>

1302
01:03:34.064 --> 01:03:35.357
<i>ultimately voted for Trump.</i>

1303
01:03:35.357 --> 01:03:37.484
<i>It was an evangelical turnout for Trump</i>

1304
01:03:37.484 --> 01:03:40.153
<i>that exceeded George W. Bush in 2004.</i>

1305
01:03:40.153 --> 01:03:42.030
<i>John McCain in 2008.</i>

1306
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:43.490
<i>and Mitt Romney in 2012.</i>

1307
01:03:45.409 --> 01:03:47.578
MARK:
<i>Much like his father before him.</i>

1308
01:03:47.578 --> 01:03:50.706
<i>Jerry Falwell Jr. is now a kingmaker.</i>

1309
01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:54.334
DUSTIN:
<i>After Trump was inaugurated as president.</i>

1310
01:03:54.334 --> 01:03:56.044
Falwell felt invincible.

1311
01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:00.215
<i>And he was increasingly weaponizing
Liberty University.</i>

1312
01:04:00.215 --> 01:04:03.510
<i>and making it into an arm
of the Trump Administration.</i>

1313
01:04:04.011 --> 01:04:07.347
- I call Liberty the Fox News Network
of the academic world.

1314
01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:10.809
- Why is it that the left mocks God?

1315
01:04:10.809 --> 01:04:15.564
- Welcome to the United States of America.

1316
01:04:15.564 --> 01:04:19.860
where illegal aliens have more rights

1317
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.613
than American citizens.

1318
01:04:22.613 --> 01:04:25.741
DONALD TRUMP JR.:
<i>Enough. Enough of the PC garbage.</i>

1319
01:04:25.741 --> 01:04:28.410
Enough of the never-ending movement
of the woke.

1320
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:33.415
- Gun owners know that the only
truly free people that have ever lived

1321
01:04:33.415 --> 01:04:34.917
have been armed people.

1322
01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:39.588
- President Jerry Falwell.
I'm inspired by the work you're doing.

1323
01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:43.717
<i>You're forcing them
to attend every single speech.</i>

1324
01:04:43.717 --> 01:04:45.344
<i>and you're repeating the same rhetoric.</i>

1325
01:04:45.344 --> 01:04:47.638
To me. that's--
that's kind of like indoctrination.

1326
01:04:47.638 --> 01:04:48.639
- Praise Jesus.
- Yes.

1327
01:04:49.348 --> 01:04:51.475
- Jerry and I have gotten
to be friends over the last year.

1328
01:04:51.475 --> 01:04:53.685
and I can tell you.
my respect for him is boundless.

1329
01:04:53.685 --> 01:04:58.232
- It's so refreshing
to come to a university

1330
01:04:58.232 --> 01:05:00.400
where people care about their country.

1331
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.444
and-- and it's okay
to say. "Merry Christmas."

1332
01:05:02.861 --> 01:05:04.530
JERRY JR.:
John Kelly. Rex Tillerson.

1333
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:07.908
lots of deep state people.
really run the government.

1334
01:05:07.908 --> 01:05:11.662
- That issue of the Confederate flag
was not about hate.

1335
01:05:11.662 --> 01:05:15.082
- As Christians.
we should be unbelievably concerned

1336
01:05:15.082 --> 01:05:18.836
that the left. first and foremost.
they wanna turn government into God.

1337
01:05:19.253 --> 01:05:22.673
<i>Jerry and Charlie Kirk
founded the Falkirk Center.</i>

1338
01:05:22.673 --> 01:05:25.509
<i>It operates as Liberty's think tank.</i>

1339
01:05:25.509 --> 01:05:27.845
But they don't do actual research.

1340
01:05:27.845 --> 01:05:31.515
<i>There's no academic product
that comes from the Falkirk Center.</i>

1341
01:05:31.515 --> 01:05:34.643
<i>It's just like a big Trump troll farm.</i>

1342
01:05:34.643 --> 01:05:38.605
<i>The launch of this center
is answering the important questions:</i>

1343
01:05:38.605 --> 01:05:40.524
Was Jesus Christ a socialist?

1344
01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:43.277
MARK:
<i>Jerry had the board under his thumb.</i>

1345
01:05:43.277 --> 01:05:45.571
And as soon as someone
from the board spoke up.

1346
01:05:46.154 --> 01:05:47.155
boom.

1347
01:05:47.656 --> 01:05:48.574
<i>New this morning.</i>

1348
01:05:48.574 --> 01:05:51.368
<i>a Liberty University board member
has resigned</i>

1349
01:05:51.368 --> 01:05:54.288
<i>after publicly criticizing
the school's president.</i>

1350
01:05:54.288 --> 01:05:58.584
DUSTIN:
<i>Mark DeMoss was Jerry Falwell Sr.'s
personal chief of staff.</i>

1351
01:05:58.584 --> 01:06:01.378
<i>DeMoss speaks
to the</i> Washington Post <i>and says.</i>

1352
01:06:01.378 --> 01:06:05.340
<i>"Donald Trump's behavior
does not reflect the Christian values</i>

1353
01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.968
<i>that have been taught
at Liberty for generations."</i>

1354
01:06:07.968 --> 01:06:12.055
<i>That was the last time a board member
stood up to challenge Falwell.</i>

1355
01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:14.933
<i>At this point.
I noticed that Jerry's behavior</i>

1356
01:06:14.933 --> 01:06:17.853
was becoming more
just egotistical and arrogant.

1357
01:06:17.853 --> 01:06:19.563
- Can you imagine
if the governor was trying

1358
01:06:19.563 --> 01:06:21.690
to take away our First Amendment rights?

1359
01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:24.860
Second Amendment's
just as-- just as sacred.

1360
01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:26.945
- The culture at Liberty was affected

1361
01:06:26.945 --> 01:06:29.531
by this permissiveness
that Falwell Jr. felt.

1362
01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:31.992
- I think they're gonna be faced
with civil disobedience.

1363
01:06:31.992 --> 01:06:35.329
not just by citizens
but by police officers.

1364
01:06:35.746 --> 01:06:39.499
<i>Jerry was offered
the position of secretary of education.</i>

1365
01:06:39.499 --> 01:06:41.293
<i>They said. "Are you gonna take it?"</i>

1366
01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:43.045
And he said.

1367
01:06:43.045 --> 01:06:46.590
"My dad told me that it's better
to be a kingmaker than a king."

1368
01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:49.384
<i>I think he was just. like. drunk on power.</i>

1369
01:06:49.384 --> 01:06:50.511
LILIA:
<i>And literally drunk.</i>

1370
01:06:50.511 --> 01:06:53.055
with his bottle of tequila
in his hand at all times.

1371
01:06:53.055 --> 01:06:56.266
- Mr. Trump learned about Clyde Fra--
Ooh. sorry.

1372
01:06:58.101 --> 01:07:00.604
- He would walk around campus
with a water bottle

1373
01:07:00.604 --> 01:07:02.773
<i>with half-water. half-tequila.</i>

1374
01:07:02.773 --> 01:07:04.942
- A lot of people at Liberty had told me

1375
01:07:04.942 --> 01:07:08.195
that Jerry was drinking during the day
at the university.

1376
01:07:08.195 --> 01:07:11.490
<i>that he was going into meetings
smelling of alcohol.</i>

1377
01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:13.033
DUSTIN:
<i>He literally said--</i>

1378
01:07:13.033 --> 01:07:16.119
- I couldn't say half the things I say
at any other university either.

1379
01:07:17.371 --> 01:07:18.956
DUSTIN:
<i>Which was exactly right.</i>

1380
01:07:18.956 --> 01:07:21.416
He couldn't. uh. because
someone would hold him accountable.

1381
01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:23.126
But nobody at Liberty ever did.

1382
01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:24.503
- Look at this.

1383
01:07:26.505 --> 01:07:28.340
- Jerry texted me a picture

1384
01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:31.468
<i>of a former student
exposing herself at his private property.</i>

1385
01:07:33.554 --> 01:07:35.722
MARK:
<i>Just think of that young girl's parents.</i>

1386
01:07:35.722 --> 01:07:37.724
They're paying
for their kid to go to Liberty.

1387
01:07:37.724 --> 01:07:39.977
and this is the receipt they got?

1388
01:07:39.977 --> 01:07:41.645
- He was basically untouchable.

1389
01:07:42.563 --> 01:07:44.481
♪

1390
01:07:44.481 --> 01:07:47.109
<i>They own. like. a 500. 600-acre farm</i>

1391
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:49.862
<i>with a Confederate cemetery on it.</i>

1392
01:07:50.529 --> 01:07:52.489
<i>Shooting guns in the backyard.</i>

1393
01:07:52.489 --> 01:07:54.700
And then Jerry said.
"Well. the good thing is.

1394
01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.077
"now I know if Becki
were to run away with someone.

1395
01:07:57.077 --> 01:07:58.078
<i>I know who it is."</i>

1396
01:07:58.078 --> 01:08:00.455
<i>He said. "If that were to happen.
if she tried to divorce me.</i>

1397
01:08:00.455 --> 01:08:01.748
<i>I'd probably have her killed."</i>

1398
01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:06.336
At that moment.
I really took it as a serious threat.

1399
01:08:07.921 --> 01:08:10.966
<i>People have so much influence.
they control this town.</i>

1400
01:08:10.966 --> 01:08:15.179
If they wanted to make me disappear.
they could do it without a trace.

1401
01:08:15.804 --> 01:08:17.014
LILIA:
<i>I mean. at the end of the day.</i>

1402
01:08:17.014 --> 01:08:19.266
<i>Jerry endorsed the guy
who ended up becoming president.</i>

1403
01:08:19.266 --> 01:08:21.852
<i>So you're like.
"I don't wanna fuck with these people.</i>

1404
01:08:21.852 --> 01:08:24.563
<i>I don't know what they would do to me
to keep their charade going."</i>

1405
01:08:24.563 --> 01:08:26.356
<i>You don't know
what lengths people are willing to go.</i>

1406
01:08:26.356 --> 01:08:28.275
<i>especially when they have so much to lose.</i>

1407
01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:30.736
GIANCARLO:
<i>As time went on.</i>

1408
01:08:30.736 --> 01:08:33.238
<i>his behavior continued
to become more radical.</i>

1409
01:08:33.906 --> 01:08:37.659
- How the establishment. the deep state--
They look at all of us as deplorables.

1410
01:08:37.659 --> 01:08:41.455
But I have the distinct honor
of being the first person

1411
01:08:41.455 --> 01:08:43.749
that Hillary Clinton called a deplorable.

1412
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:49.004
It was 2015. and it was right after
the San Bernardino shootings. and I said--

1413
01:08:49.004 --> 01:08:52.341
<i>If some of those people
in that community center</i>

1414
01:08:52.341 --> 01:08:55.177
had had what I've got
in my back pocket right now--

1415
01:08:59.056 --> 01:09:02.893
If more good people
had concealed carry permits.

1416
01:09:02.893 --> 01:09:04.686
then we could end those Muslims

1417
01:09:04.686 --> 01:09:07.064
before they--
before they walk in and kill.

1418
01:09:08.774 --> 01:09:12.486
- At this point. I didn't really see
much common ground with Jerry anymore.

1419
01:09:12.486 --> 01:09:16.532
- It just boggles my mind
that anybody would be against

1420
01:09:16.532 --> 01:09:19.660
what Jesus told his disciples
in Luke 22:36.

1421
01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:23.580
He told 'em if they had to sell their coat
to buy a sword. to do it.

1422
01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.541
Because he knew danger was coming.

1423
01:09:25.541 --> 01:09:27.668
and he wanted them to defend themselves.

1424
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:32.631
GIANCARLO:
<i>We have seen the divide happen
between Conservatives and Liberals.</i>

1425
01:09:32.631 --> 01:09:34.258
<i>and. you know. he was cognizant of that.</i>

1426
01:09:34.258 --> 01:09:35.509
<i>He would just always bring it up.</i>

1427
01:09:35.509 --> 01:09:39.096
- Virginians. including my family.
went to war in the Revolutionary War.

1428
01:09:39.096 --> 01:09:41.306
Revolution always bubbles up.

1429
01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:44.476
CHILD:
Wow. good shot!

1430
01:09:44.476 --> 01:09:46.812
- That's what's happened
with President Trump.

1431
01:09:46.812 --> 01:09:49.940
And so they can--
they can oppress people for a while.

1432
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.943
but. eventually.
people speak for themselves.

1433
01:09:52.943 --> 01:09:53.986
<i>and they've had enough.</i>

1434
01:09:55.195 --> 01:09:57.322
<i>He would say.
"We're so close to a civil war."</i>

1435
01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.241
- Got it.

1436
01:09:59.241 --> 01:10:03.829
- I'm noticing this really obvious.
blatant divide within our country.

1437
01:10:04.913 --> 01:10:09.459
<i>This extreme violent rhetoric
being pushed by Trump</i>

1438
01:10:09.459 --> 01:10:11.920
<i>and everyone within his orbit.
including Jerry.</i>

1439
01:10:12.462 --> 01:10:15.174
I started noticing that there's
actual consequences to these words.

1440
01:10:15.174 --> 01:10:16.216
It's not just words anymore.

1441
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:18.010
It's leading to violence.

1442
01:10:18.427 --> 01:10:20.345
<i>People proudly had
their Confederate flags.</i>

1443
01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:21.805
<i>They're not talking about racism.</i>

1444
01:10:21.805 --> 01:10:22.848
<i>They love their flag.</i>

1445
01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:25.100
It represents the South.
They like the South.

1446
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.518
People. right now. like the South.

1447
01:10:27.102 --> 01:10:29.813
<i>A young white man
accused of killing nine people--</i>

1448
01:10:29.813 --> 01:10:31.982
REPORTER 2:
<i>Roof revealed that he chose the church</i>

1449
01:10:31.982 --> 01:10:34.776
<i>because it was
a historic African American church.</i>

1450
01:10:34.776 --> 01:10:38.363
- Corrupt. power-hungry globalists.

1451
01:10:38.363 --> 01:10:39.907
<i>You know what a globalist is. right?</i>

1452
01:10:39.907 --> 01:10:41.575
<i>You know what a globalist is.</i>

1453
01:10:41.992 --> 01:10:44.453
<i>A gunman
burst into the Tree of Life Temple</i>

1454
01:10:44.453 --> 01:10:46.788
<i>down the tree-lined streets

1455
01:10:47.289 --> 01:10:48.624
<i>11 people killed.</i>

01:10:48.624 --> 01:10:50.751
<i>The shooter's social media page stating...</i>

1457
01:10:55.339 --> 01:10:57.799
<i>Do you think
somebody's helping that caravan?</i>

1458
01:11:00.469 --> 01:11:02.888
<i>I wouldn't-- I don't know who.
but I-- I wouldn't be surprised.</i>

1459
01:11:02.888 --> 01:11:04.056
<i>A lot of people say. "Yes."</i>

1460
01:11:04.056 --> 01:11:07.935
- The shooter had posted
about the caravan of migrants

1461
01:11:07.935 --> 01:11:11.939
moving up from. uh. Central America.
called them invaders.

1462
01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:15.067
- That's an invasion.
That's not-- That's an invasion.

1463
01:11:15.984 --> 01:11:18.195
- And then. you-- you have
what happened in Charlottesville.

1464
01:11:24.409 --> 01:11:26.078
REPORTER 1:
<i>Hundreds of white nationalists.</i>

1465
01:11:26.078 --> 01:11:27.955
<i>some wearing what appeared to be uniforms.</i>

1466
01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:30.832
<i>carrying weapons. Confederate flags.
and Nazi symbols--</i>

1467
01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:36.171
<i>A horrifying scene.
as this car plowed into a crowd of people.</i>

1468
01:11:36.171 --> 01:11:38.173
- Very bad people in that group.

1469
01:11:38.173 --> 01:11:43.762
But you also had people
that were very fine people on both sides.

1470
01:11:44.346 --> 01:11:46.598
- Falwell rushed to Donald Trump's defense

1471
01:11:46.598 --> 01:11:47.641
as eagerly as ever.

1472
01:11:48.517 --> 01:11:50.269
JERRY JR.:
<i>One of the reasons I supported him</i>

1473
01:11:50.269 --> 01:11:54.189
<i>is because he doesn't say
what's politically correct.</i>

1474
01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:56.817
he says what's in his heart.
what he believes.

1475
01:11:56.817 --> 01:11:58.569
And sometimes. that gets him in trouble.

1476
01:11:59.194 --> 01:12:02.531
<i>The seeds of that were
in the work of people like Jerry Falwell</i>

1477
01:12:02.531 --> 01:12:04.116
<i>generations earlier.</i>

1478
01:12:04.116 --> 01:12:06.577
He laid the foundations
for-- for this kind of political violence

1479
01:12:06.577 --> 01:12:08.662
that we've seen. really. since the 1990s.

1480
01:12:08.662 --> 01:12:11.248
- The man charged
with killing an abortion doctor

1481
01:12:11.248 --> 01:12:13.792
says he has a defense. the Bible!

1482
01:12:14.793 --> 01:12:20.591
- <i>Roe vs. Wade</i> has resulted
in 10 to 12 million deaths
of little children.

1483
01:12:21.717 --> 01:12:24.386
MATTHEW:
<i>Jerry Falwell has unleashed demons</i>

1484
01:12:24.386 --> 01:12:25.971
<i>that he can no longer control.</i>

1485
01:12:27.806 --> 01:12:29.808
JERRY SR.:
<i>Contrary to the wishes of the founders</i>

1486
01:12:29.808 --> 01:12:34.021
<i>who wanted neutrality as the policy
of the government toward religion.</i>

1487
01:12:34.021 --> 01:12:36.231
in fact. the government
was becoming hostile.

1488
01:12:36.231 --> 01:12:37.733
in my opinion. towards religion.

1489
01:12:37.733 --> 01:12:39.359
- This new Christian nationalism

1490
01:12:39.359 --> 01:12:41.737
gives rise to things
like the Oklahoma City bombing--

1491
01:12:41.737 --> 01:12:44.990
REPORTER 1:
<i>It looks like part of the building
has been blown away.</i>

1492
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:47.242
-<i>Look at that shot.</i>
-<i>Wow. Holy cow!</i>

1493
01:12:47.242 --> 01:12:48.827
REPORTER 2:
<i>It is absolutely incredible.</i>

1494
01:12:48.827 --> 01:12:50.704
- And nobody's bothering you. right?
- Well--

1495
01:12:52.456 --> 01:12:54.791
<i>The bombing
at Centennial Olympic Park this morning</i>

1496
01:12:54.791 --> 01:12:56.627
was an evil act of terror.

1497
01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.337
REPORTER 1:
<i>Eric Rudolph is charged with</i>

1498
01:12:58.337 --> 01:13:01.131
<i>the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing.</i>

1499
01:13:01.131 --> 01:13:05.093
REPORTER 2:
<i>Rudolph next struck at a Sandy Springs.
Georgia. abortion clinic.</i>

1500
01:13:05.093 --> 01:13:06.428
<i>then a gay bar in Atlanta.</i>

1501
01:13:06.428 --> 01:13:09.556
<i>and finally. another abortion clinic
in Birmingham. Alabama.</i>

1502
01:13:09.556 --> 01:13:12.809
<i>Rudolph is believed
to belong to the Christian identity</i>

1503
01:13:12.809 --> 01:13:15.062
<i>known as a white supremacist sect.</i>

1504
01:13:15.062 --> 01:13:16.688
MATTHEW:
<i>One thing Jerry Sr. taught us</i>

1505
01:13:16.688 --> 01:13:21.068
<i>was that politics. demagoguery.
and hysteria is a way to make more money.</i>

1506
01:13:21.068 --> 01:13:22.653
<i>give them more influence and more power.</i>

1507
01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.947
<i>And so. Jerry Jr. recognizes this</i>

1508
01:13:24.947 --> 01:13:27.574
<i>and really picks up
with what his father had started.</i>

1509
01:13:27.574 --> 01:13:31.662
- I did notice that the only time
the president calls me to go on TV

1510
01:13:31.662 --> 01:13:33.038
is when he's in real trouble.

1511
01:13:33.038 --> 01:13:35.624
- I felt guilty.
I'm like. "I know the truth about Jerry.

1512
01:13:35.624 --> 01:13:37.626
"He's trying to appear
as this. like. strongman.

1513
01:13:37.626 --> 01:13:40.504
<i>but I know him as just the cuck
in the corner of the room."</i>

1514
01:13:43.549 --> 01:13:47.052
ARAM ROSTON:
<i>I started looking at Jerry Falwell.</i>

1515
01:13:47.052 --> 01:13:49.763
<i>in part. because
of his endorsement for Trump.</i>

1516
01:13:50.556 --> 01:13:51.849
<i>For a lot of people. it was a surprise.</i>

1517
01:13:51.849 --> 01:13:55.227
Trump didn't fit the model. necessarily.
of the evangelical candidate.

1518
01:13:55.811 --> 01:13:56.812
<i>It was a puzzle.</i>

1519
01:13:58.564 --> 01:14:01.108
<i>One of the things you routinely do
as a-- as a journalist</i>

1520
01:14:01.108 --> 01:14:02.609
<i>is you look at people's backgrounds.</i>

1521
01:14:02.609 --> 01:14:05.028
<i>and one of those things is litigation.</i>

1522
01:14:05.028 --> 01:14:08.657
And that's where I saw.
you know. this-- this-- this lawsuit.

1523
01:14:11.243 --> 01:14:13.120
<i>The lawsuit alleged</i>

1524
01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:18.166
that this father and son
had been inappropriately cut out

1525
01:14:18.166 --> 01:14:19.793
of this business transaction

1526
01:14:19.793 --> 01:14:23.630
<i>involving this youth hostel.
Giancarlo Granda. and Falwell.</i>

1527
01:14:24.882 --> 01:14:27.134
I did my best to find Giancarlo Granda.

1528
01:14:27.134 --> 01:14:28.927
I did my best to figure out who he was.

1529
01:14:31.471 --> 01:14:32.931
GIANCARLO:
<i>Aram Roston texted me.</i>

1530
01:14:32.931 --> 01:14:35.225
<i>introducing himself.
that he's a journalist.</i>

1531
01:14:35.225 --> 01:14:37.186
<i>and he would like
to have a conversation with me.</i>

1532
01:14:38.687 --> 01:14:41.273
He was asking questions about the lawsuit.

1533
01:14:41.273 --> 01:14:43.025
<i>about Michael Cohen.</i>

1534
01:14:43.025 --> 01:14:45.277
<i>I realized that this was gonna get messy.</i>

1535
01:14:46.236 --> 01:14:48.113
<i>But I was instructed by the Falwells</i>

1536
01:14:48.113 --> 01:14:49.198
to give him no comment.

1537
01:14:49.198 --> 01:14:52.117
<i>and just to communicate
with my attorney. or Jerry.</i>

1538
01:14:53.493 --> 01:14:54.828
LILIA:
<i>What do you do. right?</i>

1539
01:14:54.828 --> 01:14:56.330
He didn't know what the right thing was.

1540
01:14:56.330 --> 01:15:00.042
And then has the Falwells
really putting the pressure on him now

1541
01:15:00.042 --> 01:15:02.044
like. "This is the time.
We gotta stick together.

1542
01:15:02.044 --> 01:15:03.212
They don't have anything."

1543
01:15:03.212 --> 01:15:05.672
But at the end of the day.
you know. my brother was worried.

1544
01:15:05.672 --> 01:15:06.798
as he should've been.

1545
01:15:06.798 --> 01:15:10.052
because people are gonna dig
and more things are gonna come out.

1546
01:15:10.052 --> 01:15:14.181
- Everything that I was afraid of
was about to actually materialize here.

1547
01:15:14.181 --> 01:15:16.350
Uh. the whole world
was gonna find out about it.

A source said that

this source believed
there was an understanding

1561
01:15:53.512 --> 01:15:54.805

1622
01:18:37.134 --> 01:18:39.428
- Right. Well.
you definitely brought the Falwells in.

1623
01:18:39.428 --> 01:18:41.471
You definitely-- With that--

1624
01:18:41.471 --> 01:18:45.267
I mean. you did the deal
with. uh. the pool. uh. the pool boy.

1625
01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:48.437
And Michael Cohen
laid out for him the scenario

1626
01:18:48.437 --> 01:18:49.771
where he said there were.

1627
01:18:49.771 --> 01:18:52.774
what Michael Cohen called.
personal photos.

1628
01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:54.693
Uh. he said
that they were the type of photos

1629
01:18:54.693 --> 01:18:57.821
that a couple wants
to keep between themselves.

1630
01:18:57.821 --> 01:18:58.572
- Yeah.

1631
01:18:58.572 --> 01:19:01.074
<i>But there's a bunch of photographs.</i>

1632
01:19:01.074 --> 01:19:03.410

01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:05.913
<i>The evangelicals
are kinkier than Tom Arnold.</i>

1634
01:19:05.913 --> 01:19:09.082
- I became a little obsessed
with this Jerry Falwell thing

1635
01:19:09.082 --> 01:19:12.377
because Jerry Falwell gave license
to all the other evangelicals

1636
01:19:12.377 --> 01:19:14.379
<i>to go. "Yeah. this is the guy."</i>

1637
01:19:15.047 --> 01:19:17.132
<i>I had a show called</i>
The Hunt for the Trump Tapes.

1638
01:19:17.132 --> 01:19:19.635
<i>I-- I wanted to meet
everybody in Trump's world</i>

1639
01:19:19.635 --> 01:19:20.844
<i>that was kinda pushed out.</i>

1640
01:19:20.844 --> 01:19:23.680
And so I just wanted to connect the dots--
I wanted the truth.

1641
01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.015
<i>It's terrible. you know?</i>

1642
01:19:25.015 --> 01:19:28.268

You know. their private photos.</i>

1643

1644

01:19:31.396 --> 01:19:33.982

1646
01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:36.109
<i>I loved them. They were like family to me.</i>

1647
01:19:36.109 --> 01:19:37.903
- He goes. "No. no. what I did."

1648
01:19:37.903 --> 01:19:40.197
and he explains
what he did for the Falwells.

1649
01:19:40.614 --> 01:19:44.826

It's like a boudoir picture of Becki."

1650
01:19:44.826 --> 01:19:45.827

1651

1652

He showed me some pictures.

01:19:49.665 --> 01:19:53.252

a bit of a scumbag too because

1654
01:19:53.836 --> 01:19:57.297

1655

01:27:17.154 --> 01:27:19.406
<i>so you can fulfill all of your dreams."</i>

1785
01:27:19.406 --> 01:27:22.034
<i>And they just
completely fucked him in the end.</i>

1786
01:27:22.868 --> 01:27:24.161
GIANCARLO:
<i>I texted Jerry.</i>

1787
01:27:32.044 --> 01:27:33.921
"Just own up to your promises

1788
01:27:33.921 --> 01:27:36.089
and we can move on with our lives
in a peaceful manner."

1789
01:27:36.757 --> 01:27:40.302
- He wasn't threatening them.
he was saying. "I want my life back.

1790
01:27:40.302 --> 01:27:41.512
"Give me what you owe me.

1791
01:27:41.512 --> 01:27:45.057
"Let's call it a day.
Let's go our separate ways.

1792
01:27:45.057 --> 01:27:46.433
Let's be done with this."

1793
01:27:46.433 --> 01:27:50.312
- The third and final blow
was... what broke all of us.

1794
01:27:50.312 --> 01:27:51.647
It was summer 2020.

1795
01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:54.024
REPORTER 1:
<i>In just a few short months.</i>

1796
01:27:54.024 --> 01:27:58.195
<i>this pandemic has infected
some two million here at home.</i>

1797
01:27:58.195 --> 01:28:00.280
MARK:
<i>So by the summer of 2020.</i>

1798
01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:03.659
the mood in this country
was like. "Is the world gonna end?

1799
01:28:03.659 --> 01:28:06.912
Was Jerry Sr. right?
Are end times upon us?"

1800
01:28:06.912 --> 01:28:11.250
<i>I mean. it's biblical
how fucked up this world had become.</i>

1801
01:28:11.834 --> 01:28:13.335
REPORTER 1:
<i>100.000.</i>

1802
01:28:13.335 --> 01:28:17.130
<i>The obituary names grow daily
with no end in sight.</i>

1803
01:28:17.130 --> 01:28:18.632
JERRY JR.:
<i>There's some bad strain of the flu</i>

1804
01:28:18.632 --> 01:28:20.175
<i>that comes in every two years.</i>

1805
01:28:20.175 --> 01:28:22.177
For some reason.
it's always on election years.

1806
01:28:22.177 --> 01:28:23.846
I don't-- I don't know why that is.

1807
01:28:23.846 --> 01:28:26.265
GIANCARLO:
<i>2020. it was a terrible year.</i>

1808
01:28:26.265 --> 01:28:27.516
<i>We had the pandemic.</i>

1809
01:28:27.516 --> 01:28:28.600
George Floyd's murdered.

1810
01:28:31.019 --> 01:28:33.230
<i>Civil unrest is unfolding.</i>

1811
01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:34.189
it's intensifying.

1812
01:28:36.275 --> 01:28:38.443
<i>And then you have Trump just.
uh. kind of doubling down</i>

1813
01:28:38.443 --> 01:28:40.863
and not trying to unite the country.

1814
01:28:40.863 --> 01:28:42.197
<i>Instead. he was enjoying this.</i>

1815
01:28:42.197 --> 01:28:43.824
<i>And he was magnifying this division.</i>

1816
01:28:44.324 --> 01:28:47.160
<i>You know what I say?
Protesters. your ass.</i>

1817
01:28:47.911 --> 01:28:50.372
<i>These are not acts of peaceful protest.</i>

1818
01:28:50.372 --> 01:28:53.250
<i>These are acts of domestic terror.</i>

1819
01:28:54.001 --> 01:28:55.752
- You know. initially. going back to 2012.

1820
01:28:55.752 --> 01:28:56.962
I admired Trump.

1821
01:28:56.962 --> 01:28:59.506
I thought he was someone
I would like to become.

1822
01:29:00.132 --> 01:29:02.759
<i>But now he aspired to be a dictator.</i>

1823
01:29:03.677 --> 01:29:07.347
My family fled a country
where there was a dictator

1824
01:29:07.347 --> 01:29:08.807
<i>that consolidated power.</i>

1825
01:29:09.683 --> 01:29:13.353
I didn't feel optimistic
about our country's future.

1826
01:29:14.188 --> 01:29:15.522
<i>At that moment. I realized</i>

1827
01:29:15.522 --> 01:29:19.318
<i>how much weight there was
behind. uh. Jerry Falwell Jr.'s words.</i>

1828
01:29:19.318 --> 01:29:23.989
<i>And if this man was able
to anoint Donald Trump in 2016.</i>

1829
01:29:23.989 --> 01:29:27.993
<i>then why wouldn't he have
that same power in 2020?</i>

1830
01:29:28.994 --> 01:29:34.875
<i>Giancarlo certainly feels like
Jerry is responsible for all this chaos.</i>

1831
01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:36.502
<i>You know. and why wouldn't he?</i>

1832
01:29:37.252 --> 01:29:38.754
<i>The kingmaker. right?</i>

1833
01:29:39.421 --> 01:29:40.631
Now. look what happened.

1834
01:29:43.759 --> 01:29:46.094
GIANCARLO:
<i>When I hit rock bottom. I had two choices:</i>

1835
01:29:46.094 --> 01:29:48.847
take my own life or take back control.

1836
01:29:48.847 --> 01:29:54.019
And. um. you know. one big takeaway
from. uh. from Trump's speech in 2012.

1837
01:29:54.603 --> 01:29:58.273
in his advice to win
in real estate or business.

1838
01:29:58.273 --> 01:29:59.733
or whatever you're doing is--

1839
01:29:59.733 --> 01:30:02.736
- Don't let people take advantage.

1840
01:30:03.237 --> 01:30:04.238
<i>Get even.</i>
- Get even.

1841
01:30:04.696 --> 01:30:07.950
It feels like right now.
this is happening for a reason.

1842
01:30:08.367 --> 01:30:10.369
Me confessing to the world
what happened...

1843
01:30:12.913 --> 01:30:15.249
would somehow stop
one of Trump's closest allies.

1844
01:30:15.249 --> 01:30:16.708
which is Jerry Falwell Jr.

1845
01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:18.252
I felt like I had a responsibility.

1846
01:30:18.919 --> 01:30:20.337
<i>I texted Jerry.</i>

1847
01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:45.737
- I think he just wanted
to just unburden himself of all of this

1848
01:30:45.737 --> 01:30:47.990
and just say.
"This is what actually happened."

1849
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:50.242
He had no other choice left at that point

1850
01:30:50.242 --> 01:30:53.620
but to just come out and speak his truth.

1851
01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:55.622
♪

1852
01:30:56.206 --> 01:30:59.334
- I'd been trying
to talk to Giancarlo Granda

1853
01:30:59.334 --> 01:31:01.587
since I first started working on this.

1854
01:31:01.587 --> 01:31:03.589
And I-- I didn't have any luck.

1855
01:31:05.048 --> 01:31:06.049
GIANCARLO:
<i>I texted him.</i>

1856
01:31:06.049 --> 01:31:08.385
<i>I said. "Hey. I would love
to meet with you</i>

1857
01:31:08.385 --> 01:31:10.137
<i>and just talk about everything
that happened."</i>

1858
01:31:11.263 --> 01:31:14.808
- I finally met Giancarlo near DC.

1859
01:31:15.601 --> 01:31:17.769
GIANCARLO:
<i>Obviously. he was shocked.</i>

1860
01:31:17.769 --> 01:31:21.440
but. like. it kinda confirmed
everything that he. uh. speculated.

1861
01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:24.401
- There was an element of hypocrisy here

1862
01:31:24.401 --> 01:31:26.195
<i>that was very glaring.</i>

1863
01:31:27.529 --> 01:31:31.408
To stand up our story.
we needed some corroborating evidence.

1864
01:31:31.408 --> 01:31:36.914
- I had certain evidence
dating back to 2012. 2013. 2014.

1865
01:31:38.123 --> 01:31:39.708
ARAM:
<i>There were these texts.</i>

1866
01:31:40.626 --> 01:31:43.462
<i>Sort of romantic. loaded phrases.</i>

1867
01:31:44.379 --> 01:31:46.840
And another one was this audio recording.

1868
01:31:47.257 --> 01:31:50.594
- All right.
- Gian's been very busy lately. studying.

1869
01:31:50.594 --> 01:31:51.929
- Yeah. yeah. sorta.
- It's good. good.

1870
01:31:51.929 --> 01:31:55.140
- His new thing is. like. telling me
every time he hooks up with people.

1871
01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:57.392
like. I-- like I don't have feelings
or something.

1872
01:31:57.392 --> 01:31:59.269
- You're gonna make her jealous. Gian.
- Yeah.

1873
01:31:59.269 --> 01:32:00.938
- Aw. I'm not trying to do that.

1874
01:32:00.938 --> 01:32:04.650
- Like a week ago.
I was in tears for a whole freakin' day.

1875
01:32:04.650 --> 01:32:05.817
Completely depressed.

1876
01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.779
- Come on. You don't--
You don't care about me anymore.

1877
01:32:08.779 --> 01:32:10.989
- Maybe the more you tell me.
the more I'll get used to it.

1878
01:32:10.989 --> 01:32:12.366
- You don't care about me anymore.

1879
01:32:12.908 --> 01:32:14.451
- Oh. yeah? Really?

1880
01:32:15.452 --> 01:32:16.703
Yeah. obviously.

1881
01:32:17.621 --> 01:32:18.455
- In an ideal world.

1882
01:32:18.455 --> 01:32:20.290
you'd have videotape
of everything that ever happens.

1883
01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:22.751
but this is not the way the world works.

1884
01:32:25.003 --> 01:32:26.672
GIANCARLO:
<i>When I showed them the video.</i>

1885
01:32:26.672 --> 01:32:28.423
<i>I mean. it was case closed right there.</i>

1886
01:32:29.132 --> 01:32:31.969
<i>On January 16th. 2019.</i>

1887
01:32:32.469 --> 01:32:35.305
Becki and I. uh.
we hop on a FaceTime call.

1888
01:32:35.722 --> 01:32:37.933
<i>and she's drinking white wine.</i>

1889
01:32:38.559 --> 01:32:41.728
<i>and then she starts stripping.
uh. completely naked.</i>

1890
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:44.523
<i>She's walking around the house.</i>

1891
01:32:44.523 --> 01:32:47.985
<i>She's going from room to room.
the places where we've had sex.</i>

1892
01:32:47.985 --> 01:32:49.278
<i>She's says. "Oh. do you remember this?"</i>

1893
01:32:49.278 --> 01:32:51.446
<i>She's going to the kitchen.
she's showing the island.</i>

1894
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:53.740
<i>"Oh. I know you remember doing it there."</i>

1895
01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:56.201
<i>And then she went into the kids' rooms.
"Remember doing it there?"</i>

1896
01:32:56.201 --> 01:33:00.330
Which is crazy. as. you know.
we-- we had sex in. uh. their kids' rooms.

1897
01:33:01.206 --> 01:33:03.792
<i>"So. do you remember this spot?
Do you remember this spot?"</i>

1898
01:33:04.710 --> 01:33:05.836
<i>And at one point.</i>

1899
01:33:05.836 --> 01:33:08.672
<i>Jerry Jr. appears to peek out
from behind a doorway.</i>

1900
01:33:11.592 --> 01:33:13.719
GIANCARLO:
<i>And at that moment. I'm like. "Oh. my God.</i>

1901
01:33:13.719 --> 01:33:16.847
<i>"I finally have
the smoking gun that I needed.</i>

1902
01:33:16.847 --> 01:33:18.515
<i>uh. to prove my side of the story."</i>

1903
01:33:20.893 --> 01:33:22.102
- Well. that helped.

1904
01:33:23.687 --> 01:33:26.315
I mean. that--
that was the-- the. you know?

1905
01:33:26.315 --> 01:33:28.525
That was. uh. very helpful.

1906
01:33:28.525 --> 01:33:32.571
the. uh. FaceTime video with Becki naked.

1907
01:33:34.323 --> 01:33:38.285
<i>Like. this is 100% true.
and Jerry has been involved since day one.</i>

1908
01:33:40.329 --> 01:33:42.623
- Well. we wouldn't have been able
to run the story

1909
01:33:42.623 --> 01:33:44.291
if we hadn't been convinced.

1910
01:33:44.291 --> 01:33:47.252
if there wasn't the corroboration
that there was.

1911
01:33:49.171 --> 01:33:53.008
- A photo posted then deleted
from Jerry Falwell Jr.'s Instagram

1912
01:33:53.008 --> 01:33:54.259
is now going viral.

1913
01:33:54.259 --> 01:33:57.387
<i>A Houston Chronicle reporter
posted this screenshot</i>

1914
01:33:57.387 --> 01:34:01.058
<i>showing Liberty University's president
with his pants unzipped--</i>

1915
01:34:01.058 --> 01:34:04.102
MEGAN:
<i>And it was an atomic scandal at Liberty.</i>

1916
01:34:04.102 --> 01:34:07.689
All these things that were not permissible
inside the Liberty community.

1917
01:34:07.689 --> 01:34:09.316
are contained in this photograph.

1918
01:34:09.316 --> 01:34:14.321
- This scandal was just another thing
that was going to back me up.

1919
01:34:14.321 --> 01:34:15.864
INTERVIEWER:
<i>And I'm just gonna throw it to you.</i>

1920
01:34:15.864 --> 01:34:17.741
<i>What was up
with that picture on Instagram?</i>

1921
01:34:17.741 --> 01:34:19.660
JERRY JR.:
<i>You know. it was weird</i> .

1922
01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.036
<i>She was-- She's pregnant.</i>

1923
01:34:21.036 --> 01:34:23.914
<i>so she couldn't get her--
she couldn't get her pants zipped.</i>

1924
01:34:24.498 --> 01:34:27.167
<i>And. uh. I was. like. trying to. like--</i>

1925
01:34:28.293 --> 01:34:31.463
<i>My-- I had a pair of jeans
that I haven't worn in a long time.</i>

1926
01:34:31.463 --> 01:34:33.173
<i>so I couldn't get mine zipped either.</i>

1927
01:34:33.173 --> 01:34:35.592
- It was evident
that he was drunk on that call.

1928
01:34:35.592 --> 01:34:37.052
I mean. he was slurring his words.

1929
01:34:37.052 --> 01:34:39.763
JERRY JR.:
<i>I promised my kids I'm gonna try to be--</i>

1930
01:34:39.763 --> 01:34:42.224
<i>I'm gonna try
to be a good boy from here on out.</i>

1931
01:34:42.224 --> 01:34:43.851
- It just showed you who he really was.

1932
01:34:43.851 --> 01:34:45.686
He was just-- He was a mess.

1933
01:34:45.686 --> 01:34:49.064
- This announcement was made
just before 05:00 this afternoon.

1934
01:34:49.064 --> 01:34:51.400
It followed a meeting
of the Executive Committee

1935
01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:53.527
<i>of Liberty's Board of Trustees.</i>

1936
01:34:53.527 --> 01:34:57.531
<i>The committee requested Falwell
take an indefinite leave of absence.</i>

1937
01:34:57.531 --> 01:34:58.740
<i>Falwell agreed.</i>

1938
01:34:59.449 --> 01:35:03.287
- Liberty's board was going to pay
for Falwell's rehab.

1939
01:35:03.287 --> 01:35:06.790
and they fully anticipated
to bring him back. uh. afterwards.

1940
01:35:07.457 --> 01:35:09.960
<i>Either they didn't think
that they would get caught</i>

1941
01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.420
<i>or that it would come back to them.</i>

1942
01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:14.298
<i>or on some level.

01:43:40.721 --> 01:43:42.598
<i>God has voted.</i>

2103
01:43:42.598 --> 01:43:46.643
Donald J. Trump will stand again
in this land. whether you like it or not.

2104
01:43:46.643 --> 01:43:49.813
- All hell is going
to break loose tomorrow.

2105
01:43:49.813 --> 01:43:52.107
<i>- You are not gonna steal this election.</i>

2106
01:43:52.107 --> 01:43:55.194
DUSTIN:
<i>There were Falkirk Center contributors</i>

2107
01:43:55.194 --> 01:43:58.071
<i>who were at the January 6th insurrection.</i>

2108
01:43:59.072 --> 01:44:01.825
TOM:
<i>Charlie Kirk paid for 80 buses of people</i>

2109
01:44:01.825 --> 01:44:05.579
<i>to go to the insurrection rally
on the-- the 6th of January.</i>

2110
01:44:06.246 --> 01:44:09.666
<i>That money could have come
from Jerry Falwell and Liberty University.</i>

2111
01:44:16.089 --> 01:44:18.342
RANDALL:
<i>These are people parading around</i>

2112
01:44:18.342 --> 01:44:20.511
<i>with Christian symbolism.</i>

2113
01:44:20.511 --> 01:44:24.973
<i>and invoking God. and Jesus. and the Bible</i>

2114
01:44:24.973 --> 01:44:28.018
<i>in the service of sedition.</i>

2115
01:44:28.018 --> 01:44:29.394
- We fight like hell.

2116
01:44:29.394 --> 01:44:32.689
And if you don't fight like hell.
you're not gonna have a country anymore.

2117
01:44:33.357 --> 01:44:35.108
DUSTIN:
<i>There was nothing Christian. obviously.</i>

2118
01:44:35.108 --> 01:44:37.319
<i>about what happened on January 6th.</i>

2119
01:44:37.861 --> 01:44:42.074
<i>There's nothing Christlike
about Trumpism or Christian nationalism.</i>

2120
01:44:42.074 --> 01:44:45.702
JACOB CHANSLEY:
<i>Thank you. Heavenly Father.
for blessing us with this opportunity.</i>

2121
01:44:45.702 --> 01:44:46.870
<i>We love you and we thank you.</i>

2122
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:48.372
<i>In Christ's holy name. we pray.</i>

2123
01:44:48.372 --> 01:44:49.998
ALL:
Amen!

2124
01:44:49.998 --> 01:44:52.501
ANTHEA:
<i>Christian extremism is just as dangerous.</i>

2125
01:44:52.501 --> 01:44:55.087
<i>or even more dangerous
than Islamic extremism</i>

2126
01:44:55.087 --> 01:44:56.672
<i>for one very big reason:</i>

2127
01:44:56.672 --> 01:44:58.674
<i>Christian extremists live next door to us.</i>

2128
01:44:58.674 --> 01:45:01.802
<i>They sit in the pews next to you.
and they work with you.</i>

2129
01:45:05.347 --> 01:45:06.223
- Help!

2130
01:45:07.015 --> 01:45:09.560
ANTHEA:
<i>And the attack in the Capitol on 1/6</i>

2131
01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.019
<i>was Christian jihad.</i>

2132
01:45:11.019 --> 01:45:15.148
- We are gonna have one nation under God.
we have to have one religion under God.

2133
01:45:15.148 --> 01:45:16.900
ANTHEA:
<i>Evangelicalism today</i>

2134
01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:20.571
<i>inserts their belief system
into the government of America.</i>

2135
01:45:20.571 --> 01:45:25.576
<i>hoping to change it into a theocracy
ruled by white Christians specifically.</i>

2136
01:45:25.576 --> 01:45:27.286
<i>and men in particular.</i>

2137
01:45:27.911 --> 01:45:31.790
<i>You cannot be a Christian
and vote Democrat in this nation!</i>

2138
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:36.253
They are God-denying demons
that butcher babies and hate this nation!

2139
01:45:36.253 --> 01:45:38.422
REPORTER 1:
<i>The Supreme Court has ruled</i>

2140
01:45:38.422 --> 01:45:42.009
<i>on the future of abortion rights
in the United States.</i>

2141
01:45:42.009 --> 01:45:44.845
<i>The landmark decision
from the United States Supreme Court</i>

2142
01:45:44.845 --> 01:45:48.473
<i>which has ended
Constitutional protections for abortion</i>

2143
01:45:48.473 --> 01:45:51.101
<i>that had been in place
for nearly 50 years</i>

2144
01:45:51.101 --> 01:45:54.521
<i>Evangelicals became
fully radicalized in the goal.</i>

2145
01:45:54.521 --> 01:45:58.400
<i>That was the justification
for the religious right's deal
with Donald Trump.</i>

2146
01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.361
<i>He single-handedly shifted
the Court far enough to the right.</i>

2147
01:46:01.361 --> 01:46:04.239
<i>it could finally undo
abortion rights in this country.</i>

2148
01:46:04.907 --> 01:46:06.617
MEGAN:
<i>In a very real way.</i>

2149
01:46:06.617 --> 01:46:10.245
<i>Jerry Falwell Jr. has now
officially completed the work</i>

2150
01:46:10.245 --> 01:46:11.580
<i>that his father began.</i>

2151
01:46:12.247 --> 01:46:16.960
<i>The black sheep and the rejected member
of the evangelical community</i>

2152
01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:20.714
<i>actually has delivered to them
in a very tangible way.</i>

2153
01:46:20.714 --> 01:46:22.591
<i>the one thing that they most sought.</i>

2154
01:46:23.717 --> 01:46:26.261
RANDALL:
<i>One of the great glories of this nation.</i>

2155
01:46:26.261 --> 01:46:30.307
<i>and I believe America's best idea.
is the First Amendment</i>

2156
01:46:30.307 --> 01:46:32.267
<i>and the separation of church and state.</i>

2157
01:46:35.103 --> 01:46:38.357
<i>This whole so-called
Christian nationalism movement</i>

2158
01:46:38.357 --> 01:46:43.654
<i>that insists that America was
and always has been a Christian nation.</i>

2159
01:46:44.321 --> 01:46:46.949
<i>the founders were
very. very clear about that.</i>

2160
01:46:46.949 --> 01:46:49.076
<i>Their intention
was precisely the opposite.</i>

2161
01:46:49.743 --> 01:46:53.705
<i>To protect the nation.
protect the government.</i>

2162
01:46:53.705 --> 01:46:57.543
<i>protect the people
from religious factionalism.</i>

2163
01:46:58.210 --> 01:47:00.963
<i>Go back on that fundamental principle.</i>

2164
01:47:01.713 --> 01:47:03.006
<i>to compromise that in some way.</i>

2165
01:47:03.006 --> 01:47:06.051
<i>I think is deeply. deeply perilous.</i>
