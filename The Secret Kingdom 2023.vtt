[narrator] Many moons ago.

4
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.230
when the lands of The Above
and The Below were one.

5
00:00:56.404 --> 00:01:00.799
a young king ruled
with a power of imagination
so great

6
00:01:00.973 --> 00:01:05.543
that his very thoughts
brought light and peace to all.

7
00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:08.720
But near the 12th year
of his reign.

8
00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:11.984
a great tragedy befell
the young king.

and his grief so great.
split the world...[person screaming]

10
00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:20.558
...into the lands of The Above
and The Below.

11
00:01:20.732 --> 00:01:23.779
where all memory of the tragedy
was buried.

12
00:01:23.953 --> 00:01:27.521
And so it was
that time stood still...[clock chimes. distorted]

13
00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:30.307
...and a great darkness
fell across the land.

14
00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:34.354
And in that darkness
grew a creature

15
00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:37.488
made of fear itself.

16
00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.971
A creature known as the Shroud.

Are you okay?

00:01:54.418 --> 00:01:55.419
Yeah.

21
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.334

Come on. Peter.

29
00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.421
I used to spend my summers here
when I was a kid.

30
00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:43.031
This place has everything
that we'’ve ever dreamt of.

[speaking French]
Did you make it?

43
00:04:18.127 --> 00:04:19.737
Come on.
we can do this.

44
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.177
[coughs] Mon Dieu!

45
00:04:27.615 --> 00:04:30.966
[sighs] How long
do we have to stay here?

46
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.273
Oh. no. no.
We are just here to clean.

47
00:04:34.534 --> 00:04:36.232
Look what I found.

48
00:04:36.406 --> 00:04:38.582
Wow!
They'’re in here too.

49
00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:40.541
They'’re quite wonderful.

50
00:04:40.715 --> 00:04:42.499
I will keep them.

51

The floors look very old.

Hello.
Mr. Frog Prince.

56
00:04:55.512 --> 00:04:56.774
I'’m the fairy queen.

57
00:04:57.732 --> 00:05:00.430
That'’s--
That'’s not a swimming pool.

58
00:05:00.604 --> 00:05:02.737
I was only talking
to the Frog Prince.

59
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:05.957
There'’s no such thing
as a "frog prince."

60
00:05:08.656 --> 00:05:11.441
You know. I once saved
your mother from a frog prince.[chuckles]

62
00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:17.142

Who could be calling?

66
00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:25.890
Close your eyes.
What do you see?

67
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.070
I see magical creatures
and a wondrous kingdom.

68
00:05:32.244 --> 00:05:33.985
And I am their queen.

69
00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.336
The Kingdom of Imagination

72
00:05:44.605 --> 00:05:46.302
What do you see. Peter?

73
00:05:46.476 --> 00:05:49.610
Come on. Pete.
Think outside the box.
What do you see?

David.
there'’s a moving truck.

75
00:05:54.702 --> 00:05:56.356
Okay. why don'’t you
go get cleaned up?

76
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.358
Oh. no! I'’m late
for the royal tea party!

77
00:05:58.532 --> 00:06:00.316
I'’m not even dressed
for it yet!

[stammering]

83
00:06:19.944 --> 00:06:21.250
But we had time.

84
00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:23.295
[David] This is the change
that we really need.

[heartbeat thumping][Vivianne. David

86
00:06:26.168 --> 00:06:29.867
[David] It'’s only been a year.
and I'’m still dealing
with this too.

87
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:31.347
[Vivianne]
All right!

88
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:33.915
This family
loses too much.

[Verity]
Come on. Peter.

Where are you going?

Verity! Wait!

97
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:09.864
[Verity]
I found it! The entrance
to the Land of Nowhere.

98
00:07:10.038 --> 00:07:12.736
Quickly. it'’s about
to close up forever.

Quickly.
She knows we'’re here.

Come out. young lady.

115
00:08:21.849 --> 00:08:24.416

Hi. I'’m Verity.

We just moved here today.
but Peter'’s not very happy
about it.

Verity. come on.

120

What do I smell like?

121
00:08:36.732 --> 00:08:40.955
You smell of sugar. spice
and all things nice. of course.

122
00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:44.480
Does Peter smell
of slime and snails?

123
00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:48.049
No. he smells of something else.

124
00:08:49.354 --> 00:08:50.399
Fear.

125
00:08:51.356 --> 00:08:54.011

Yes. I-- I mean. well.

Okay.

149
00:10:21.969 --> 00:10:27.148
I want you to close your eyes
and imagine the very best think
you can.

150
00:10:27.322 --> 00:10:29.759
I love this game.
I'’m going to catch
the best think ever.

Come on. come on.
You used to love this game.

154
00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:42.990
Give it a go.
Use your imagination.

155
00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:46.471
I'’m sure there'’s still
some magic in there.

157
00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:00.616
Have you got a think yet?

You let them all out.

Peter. where have you been?
Are you okay?

164
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.649
Hold on.
I have something for you.

Grandpa'’s compass.

166

He promised this to you.
yes? [chuckles]

167
00:11:41.744 --> 00:11:45.052
If not for this compass.
you and I may not be here.

It'’s really sticky.

I need the thing.

180
00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:56.601
Ugh. what thing?

181
00:12:56.776 --> 00:13:00.127
The thing you broke
in the store. I need it.[groans]

182
00:13:00.692 --> 00:13:01.781
Why?

183
00:13:03.608 --> 00:13:04.958
I'’m not supposed to say.

184
00:13:06.698 --> 00:13:08.265
[whispers] It'’s magic.

185
00:13:08.439 --> 00:13:12.879
[groans] Look. Verity.
I'’m in no mood for your games.

186
00:13:13.053 --> 00:13:15.098
Just go back to bed.

187
00:13:20.538 --> 00:13:21.931
So. can I have it?

188
00:13:22.105 --> 00:13:23.890
[grunts]

189
00:13:24.064 --> 00:13:25.717
You'’re not gonna let up.
are you?

190
00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:27.241
Just--

191
00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:30.287
If you want it so badly.
I'’ll sell it to you.

192
00:13:57.184 --> 00:13:58.794
[coins jingling]

193
00:14:03.233 --> 00:14:04.887
One penny. two penny.

194
00:14:05.061 --> 00:14:07.281
three penny. four penny--Verity. just stop.

195
00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:11.067
Give me the jar.
and I'’ll give you
the battered puzzle thing.

196
00:14:20.076 --> 00:14:21.861
[gasps. breathes heavily]

197
00:14:22.035 --> 00:14:23.036
[electricity crackling]

198

[Verity screams][Peter gasps]

200
00:14:31.479 --> 00:14:32.741
Peter!

201
00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:36.788
Peter! Jump![floorboards creaking]

202
00:14:36.963 --> 00:14:39.661
Peter! Please!

203
00:14:41.576 --> 00:14:42.577
Peter!

204
00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:44.622
Don'’t let me go!

205
00:14:47.364 --> 00:14:49.149
[both screaming]

206
00:14:52.717 --> 00:14:54.023
Verity. are you okay?

207
00:14:54.197 --> 00:14:55.807
Peter. I'’m scared.

208
00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:56.983
[Peter grunts]

209
00:14:58.593 --> 00:15:00.421
It'’s okay.
It'’s gonna be okay.

210
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.905
Hold on.

211
00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:11.823
There'’s nothing there.
There'’s nothing there.
There'’s nothing there.

212
00:15:11.998 --> 00:15:14.783
There'’s nothing there.
There'’s nothing there.
There'’s nothing there.

213
00:15:14.957 --> 00:15:16.785
Peter. open your eyes.
They'’re everywhere.

214
00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:20.093
No. they'’re not.
There'’s nothing there.Stop saying that!

215
00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:23.574
We'’re gonna close our eyes.
and we'’re gonna count to three.

216
00:15:23.748 --> 00:15:27.578
Then we'’re gonna open our eyes.
and we'’re gonna see
there'’s nothing there.

217
00:15:27.752 --> 00:15:28.666
All right?

218
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.539
[both] One. two. three.

219
00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:37.284
Oh. no. no.
no. no. no. no.

220
00:15:37.458 --> 00:15:39.112
[pangolin whistles]

[speaking pangolin language]

222
00:15:42.158 --> 00:15:44.639
Peter. they said
to hold on tight![Peter] What?

223
00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:46.684
[continues speaking
pangolin language]

224
00:15:46.858 --> 00:15:48.948
[Peter breathing heavily]

[both scream]

226
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.723
No. No!

[chattering continues]

[speaking pangolin language]

233
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.401
Is that so?

234
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.751
Well. thank you.

235
00:17:36.925 --> 00:17:39.275
Don'’t worry. Peter.
They'’re very friendly.

236
00:17:39.449 --> 00:17:41.016
Who are you talking to?

237
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.149
[speaking pangolin language]Oh. of course.

238
00:17:43.323 --> 00:17:44.976
He can'’t understand you yet.

239
00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.110
Peter.
you have to hold very still.

240
00:17:48.284 --> 00:17:51.505
You'’ll find it tickles.
but it doesn'’t hurt a bit.

241
00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:53.724
[Peter] What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

242
00:17:54.769 --> 00:17:56.336
[grunts] Oh!

243
00:17:58.207 --> 00:17:59.208
What was that?

244
00:17:59.382 --> 00:18:01.776
[in English]
Your satchel. sire.

245
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.994
They can talk.

246
00:18:03.734 --> 00:18:04.953
They can talk.

247
00:18:05.127 --> 00:18:06.476
[Verity]
Well. of course they can.

248
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:07.782
Um...

249
00:18:12.047 --> 00:18:13.570
[stammering] Huh...

250
00:18:15.311 --> 00:18:17.226
What is the meaning of this?

251
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.360
General Rumph.
we are victorious.

252
00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:22.231
We have saved the king.

253
00:18:22.405 --> 00:18:23.624
And just in time.

254
00:18:23.798 --> 00:18:25.800
You fools!

255
00:18:25.974 --> 00:18:28.107
You'’ve risked our position
for nothing.

256
00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:30.196
This is just a child.

257
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:35.549
[pangolin leader]
Our king shall not
be judged by his years.

258
00:18:35.723 --> 00:18:38.726
but by his deeds.

259
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.380
He looks most important.

260
00:18:40.554 --> 00:18:42.730
Look. Verity.
I'’ll do the talking.

261
00:18:42.904 --> 00:18:44.427
Why?

262
00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:46.777
Because I'’m the oldest.
and that'’s the rule.

263
00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:48.344
That is not a rule.

264
00:18:48.518 --> 00:18:50.477
You just made that up.

265
00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:53.654
These guards
have deliberately
broken protocol.

266
00:18:53.828 --> 00:18:56.526
We now risk a direct attack
from the Shroud.

267
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.879
Protocol does not
trump prophecy. my dear general.

268
00:19:02.053 --> 00:19:06.057
Respectfully.
the pangolin have lost too many
to this prophecy of yours.

269
00:19:07.189 --> 00:19:11.062
And many more shall be lost.

270
00:19:11.237 --> 00:19:13.891
should the prophecy
not prevail.

271
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:21.725
I have waited for this day
a long time.

272
00:19:21.899 --> 00:19:25.381
A long. long time.

273
00:19:27.514 --> 00:19:30.256
Welcome. Your Majesty.

274
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:31.822
Why. thank you.

275
00:19:31.996 --> 00:19:34.390
I'’m Verity.
and this is Peter.[Peter] Shh.

276
00:19:34.564 --> 00:19:37.001
Who are you. and why have
you brought us here?

277
00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:40.788
My apologies. Your Majesty.

278
00:19:40.962 --> 00:19:45.836
I am Elwyn.
leader of the pangolin.

279
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.099
Keepers of the prophecy.

280
00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:53.104
Your arrival was foretold
many moons ago.

281
00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:56.891
I'’m sorry. but I think
you'’ve mistaken me
for someone else.

282
00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:59.067
[Elwyn] You are Peter.

283
00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.812
You are to reunite
our two great lands

284
00:20:04.986 --> 00:20:07.945
and restore light
and peace to The Below.

285
00:20:08.119 --> 00:20:09.904
No. but that can'’t
possibly be me.

286
00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:11.471
I just moved here today.

287
00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:17.564
You carry with you an object
of great. great power.

288
00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:21.002
A golden piece

289
00:20:21.176 --> 00:20:24.571
inscribed with the language
of prophecy.

290
00:20:27.051 --> 00:20:29.445
You mean-- You mean this?

291
00:20:29.619 --> 00:20:32.405
[pangolins chattering.
clamoring]

292
00:20:32.579 --> 00:20:35.234
Behold your king.

293
00:20:35.408 --> 00:20:37.366
[pangolins exclaiming]

294
00:20:43.198 --> 00:20:46.332
No. no. Everyone.
everyone. this is just
a big misunderstanding.

295
00:20:46.506 --> 00:20:47.898
I'’m not a king.

296
00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:53.208
[pangolins continue exclaiming]

297
00:20:53.382 --> 00:20:56.777
My brothers and sisters.

298
00:20:56.951 --> 00:21:00.389
on this great. great day.

299
00:21:00.563 --> 00:21:04.915
the prophecy
has delivered unto us

300
00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:07.440
our promised king.

301
00:21:08.354 --> 00:21:10.486
Come. Your Majesty.

302
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.706
There is much for you to see.

303
00:21:13.968 --> 00:21:15.491
No. Verity. wait.

304
00:21:15.665 --> 00:21:18.189
Come on. Peter. We mustn'’t
keep them waiting.

305
00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.148
No. [sighs]

306
00:21:27.503 --> 00:21:30.854
I'’m sorry. but we don'’t
belong here. and we really
have to get back home.

307
00:21:31.028 --> 00:21:32.769
But I don'’t wanna
go home yet.

308
00:21:32.943 --> 00:21:36.556
The portal to The Above
has been closed

309
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.297
for your protection.

310
00:21:39.123 --> 00:21:41.256
The way back is shut.

311
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.693
But do not fear. young Peter.

312
00:21:43.867 --> 00:21:46.305
Your path ahead
is quite clear.

313
00:21:46.479 --> 00:21:48.045
Your Majesty.

314
00:21:48.219 --> 00:21:49.133
Your Majesty.

315
00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:50.787
Your Majesty.

316
00:21:50.961 --> 00:21:54.356
Oh. I just love your dress.
[chuckles]

317
00:21:55.618 --> 00:21:57.185
Ooh. Your Majesty.

318
00:21:57.359 --> 00:22:00.144
Hello. It'’s lovely
to meet you all.

319
00:22:01.668 --> 00:22:02.756
Pling.

320
00:22:03.887 --> 00:22:04.932
Yes. sir.

321
00:22:05.628 --> 00:22:06.934
You'’re late.

322
00:22:07.717 --> 00:22:10.198
Um. yes. Uncle.

323
00:22:11.982 --> 00:22:14.333
I-I mean. sir.

324
00:22:14.985 --> 00:22:16.117
Sorry. [stammers]

325
00:22:16.291 --> 00:22:17.727
It won'’t happen again.

326
00:22:17.901 --> 00:22:19.294
What did I miss?

327
00:22:22.689 --> 00:22:25.169
The compass! It'’s him!

328
00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:28.434
I mean. you.

329
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.566
You'’re here.

330
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.002
You'’re really here.

331
00:22:33.308 --> 00:22:34.222
Oh-Oh. my.

332
00:22:34.396 --> 00:22:39.183
I-- I mean. Your Majesty.

333
00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:45.276
Pling. fetch the sacred book
and join us in the cave.

334
00:22:46.843 --> 00:22:48.410
Um. yes.

335
00:22:48.584 --> 00:22:49.542
Of course. Uncle.

336
00:22:49.716 --> 00:22:52.196
I-I mean. Master Elwyn.

337
00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:56.679
It'’s really you!Now. Pling.

338
00:22:56.853 --> 00:22:58.072
Of course. Uncle.

339
00:22:58.638 --> 00:22:59.943
Wow!

340
00:23:00.117 --> 00:23:01.641
[Verity giggles]

341
00:23:01.815 --> 00:23:03.947
Pling.Oh. Uh...

342
00:23:15.176 --> 00:23:18.092
Behold the prophecy.

343
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.444
[Verity] Wow!

344
00:23:22.618 --> 00:23:24.707
It'’s a bird.[bird chirping]

345
00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:26.579
And a dragon.

346
00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:29.059
Oh. wait. there. look!

347
00:23:29.233 --> 00:23:31.148
A unicorn!

348
00:23:31.322 --> 00:23:37.067
This part of the prophecy
tells of the time before.

349
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:42.159
The time when the lands
of The Above and The Below
were one.

350
00:23:43.073 --> 00:23:46.337
A time before the Shroud.

351
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.691
Um. I mean no disrespect.
but why are we here?

352
00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:53.867
That looks like me
in my pretty nightdress.

353
00:23:54.041 --> 00:23:55.259
That'’s my necklace.

354
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:57.914
It can'’t be.
That'’s impossible.

355
00:23:58.088 --> 00:24:02.615
This is the foretelling
of your arrival.

356
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:07.097
"A golden piece
from deepest cave.

357
00:24:07.271 --> 00:24:11.972
A chosen king.

00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:35.874
[Peter] "When time is ten
and two strokes end."

711
00:43:36.048 --> 00:43:37.223
Twelve.

712
00:43:37.397 --> 00:43:38.833
Twelve.

713
00:43:39.007 --> 00:43:40.443
XII is 12.

714
00:43:41.706 --> 00:43:44.665
"A boy will find
the age of men."

715
00:43:44.839 --> 00:43:46.232
[Verity]
What'’s the age of me?

716
00:43:46.406 --> 00:43:48.843
I'’m nine.
but the numbers are funny.

717
00:43:49.017 --> 00:43:53.805
X is ten
and nine is one before ten.

718
00:43:54.544 --> 00:43:57.156
Therefore. you are IX.

719
00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.592
Here I am.

720
00:44:00.812 --> 00:44:02.030
[Verity grunts]

721
00:44:02.204 --> 00:44:04.337
One and X.

722
00:44:04.511 --> 00:44:05.773
[sighs]

723
00:44:06.731 --> 00:44:08.689
"Boy will find the age of men."

724
00:44:08.863 --> 00:44:11.518
If two strokes end.

725
00:44:11.692 --> 00:44:14.434
then that'’ll make it 13.

726
00:44:14.608 --> 00:44:16.044
But that doesn'’t make sense.

727
00:44:16.218 --> 00:44:19.134
Thirteen?
Clocks only go to 12.

728
00:44:19.308 --> 00:44:23.704
[stammering]
Excuse me. sire. if I may.

729
00:44:23.878 --> 00:44:28.361
Many cultures consider 13
to be the age of men.

730
00:44:28.535 --> 00:44:31.190
A time when childhood
is left behind.

731
00:44:31.364 --> 00:44:32.887
[Peter] You'’re right. Pling.

732
00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:36.151
There must be a number 13
around here somewhere.

733
00:44:43.985 --> 00:44:46.031
"Mark is scored with three.

734
00:44:46.205 --> 00:44:49.208
A stone is hidden
where eyes must see."

735
00:44:58.434 --> 00:44:59.653
The 13!

736
00:45:00.393 --> 00:45:01.524
Yes!

737
00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:02.917
Finally. Okay.

738
00:45:03.091 --> 00:45:06.007
Okay. so. "Where eyes must see."

739
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:08.618
"Eyes must see." Come on.

740
00:45:08.793 --> 00:45:10.229
[sighs] What is it?

741
00:45:12.448 --> 00:45:14.973
"When eyes must see."

742
00:45:18.019 --> 00:45:19.107
The three blind mice.

743
00:45:19.847 --> 00:45:20.848
Okay.

744
00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:30.292
[laughs]

745
00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:35.080
I got it!

746
00:45:41.477 --> 00:45:43.131
Peter!Verity!

747
00:45:44.393 --> 00:45:45.394
Quickly. Miss Verity.

748
00:45:45.568 --> 00:45:46.831
[ground rumbling]

749
00:46:02.107 --> 00:46:04.109

[gasping]

755
00:47:06.736 --> 00:47:07.912
[Verity] Peter!

756
00:47:08.086 --> 00:47:09.217
Verity!

757
00:47:25.103 --> 00:47:26.495
[gasps. whimpers]

758
00:47:30.978 --> 00:47:31.979
Okay.

759
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:35.417
If I make it there
in three seconds.

760
00:47:35.591 --> 00:47:36.679
If I make it there.

761
00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:38.333
[Verity] Peter![gasps]

762
00:47:44.296 --> 00:47:47.299
If I make it there.
I can make it there
in three seconds.

763
00:47:47.473 --> 00:47:49.910
If I make it there
in three seconds.

764
00:47:50.084 --> 00:47:51.956
Verity. [breathing heavily]

765
00:48:08.537 --> 00:48:11.149
Leave my sister alone!

766
00:48:11.845 --> 00:48:13.499
[growls]

767
00:48:13.673 --> 00:48:15.457
I am your king!

768
00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:18.765
You will yield!

769
00:48:18.939 --> 00:48:20.854
[growls]

770
00:48:26.251 --> 00:48:28.383

00:48:28.949 --> 00:48:30.951
[sobbing]

772
00:48:31.125 --> 00:48:35.260
Please! Please.
forgive me. Your Majesty.

773
00:48:37.262 --> 00:48:38.872
What are you
crying about?

774
00:48:39.046 --> 00:48:40.918
You near frightened us
to death.

775
00:48:41.092 --> 00:48:43.964
I'’m sorry. I didn'’t mean to.

776
00:48:44.965 --> 00:48:46.662
I'’m just so hungry.

777
00:48:46.836 --> 00:48:48.882
We are most definitely not food.

778
00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:52.277
I wa--
I wasn'’t going to eat you.

779
00:48:52.451 --> 00:48:53.931
Honest.

780
00:48:54.105 --> 00:48:55.758
I don'’t eat people.

781
00:48:56.672 --> 00:48:58.239
I'’m an empath.

782
00:48:58.413 --> 00:49:02.809
I suppose you could say
I eat my feelings.

783
00:49:02.983 --> 00:49:05.116
Probably how I got so big.

784
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.728
Oh. the shame! [cries]

785
00:49:08.902 --> 00:49:11.600
I'’m sorry. Your Majesty.

786
00:49:11.774 --> 00:49:15.561
I will accept any punishment
you see fit.

787
00:49:15.735 --> 00:49:18.129
I deserve it. [sniffles]

788
00:49:18.303 --> 00:49:20.914
It'’s okay. You'’re not
gonna be punished.

789
00:49:21.654 --> 00:49:23.525
Really? Really?

790
00:49:23.699 --> 00:49:24.831
Of course not.

791
00:49:25.005 --> 00:49:28.008
Oh! Your Majesty.
thank you.

792
00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:30.010
Thank you.

793
00:49:30.184 --> 00:49:33.796
You are indeed
a great and generous king.

794
00:49:34.623 --> 00:49:36.843
I am forever in your debt.

795
00:49:37.017 --> 00:49:38.410
[Peter]
What is your name?

796
00:49:40.673 --> 00:49:47.158
My name is
Navitatis Immutatio
Puerili Mendax.

797
00:49:47.332 --> 00:49:48.681
You'’ve changed.

798
00:49:48.855 --> 00:49:51.989
It'’s true.
I'’m changed. reformed even.

799
00:49:52.163 --> 00:49:54.687
I promise I'’ll never scare
another soul.

800
00:49:54.861 --> 00:49:59.170
No. He means
your body has transformed.

801
00:49:59.344 --> 00:50:03.609
Oh. that.
That happens with age.
I'’m afraid.

802
00:50:03.783 --> 00:50:05.219
Lost elasticity.

803
00:50:05.393 --> 00:50:08.092
I used to be able
to change into anything.

804
00:50:08.266 --> 00:50:12.400
but these days.
I'’m more comfortable
in larger. less fitted forms.

805
00:50:12.574 --> 00:50:14.663
You can change
into anything?

806
00:50:14.837 --> 00:50:19.581
This creature does not appear
anywhere in the prophecy. sire.

807
00:50:19.755 --> 00:50:21.975
I'’m not sure we can trust it.

808
00:50:22.149 --> 00:50:26.545
But you can. I-I promise.
Cross my heart.

809
00:50:26.719 --> 00:50:29.722
Please. sire.
let me come with you.

810
00:50:29.896 --> 00:50:31.811
I can be quite useful.

811
00:50:31.985 --> 00:50:34.248
We could do
with some transport.

812
00:50:34.422 --> 00:50:37.034
Oh. I can be very fleet-footed.

813
00:50:37.208 --> 00:50:39.079
This creature
could be dangerous.

814
00:50:39.862 --> 00:50:41.603
Oh. I can fix that.

815
00:50:45.999 --> 00:50:47.435
Safety first.

816
00:50:47.609 --> 00:50:49.394
That'’s not what I meant.

817
00:50:49.568 --> 00:50:50.917

818
00:50:52.136 --> 00:50:54.660

"East within the desert stands.

That looks to be

how can you be sure
the artifact is here?

The compass is attracted
to the hidden pieces.

I could do with a rest
after the journey.

Your deeds shall be sung
far and wide.

1061
01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:14.171
What are you talking about?
You didn'’t even see it.

1062
01:05:14.345 --> 01:05:16.390
Quiet. you philistine.

1063
01:05:16.564 --> 01:05:19.306
Great art
does not require witness.

1064
01:05:25.138 --> 01:05:26.226
It feels funny.

1065
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.925
What? What is it?
What'’s wrong?

1066
01:05:29.099 --> 01:05:30.665
She doesn'’t have much time.

1067
01:05:30.839 --> 01:05:33.581
Much time?
What are you talking about?
She'’s fine.

1068
01:05:33.755 --> 01:05:35.975
Right? Right. Verity?It feels really funny.
Peter.

1069
01:05:36.149 --> 01:05:40.414
Pling. what do we do?You must find the final piece
and get to the Citadel.

1070
01:05:40.588 --> 01:05:43.678
Piece? No. we have to help her.
We need to take her to someone.

1071
01:05:43.852 --> 01:05:46.290
Mendax is correct. Peter.

1072
01:05:46.464 --> 01:05:50.033
The prophecy states
that the fallen
will only be released

1073
01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:53.210
when the great clock
is restarted.

1074
01:05:53.384 --> 01:05:55.386
Am I going to be a statue.
Peter?

1075
01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.823
I don'’t want
to be a statue.

1076
01:05:57.997 --> 01:06:00.782
[Peter]
Pling. this happens. right?
This is part of the prophecy.

1077
01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.046
I can'’t move my fingers.

1078
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.222
Yes. you can. Show me.

1079
01:06:06.527 --> 01:06:07.572
I can'’t.

1080
01:06:07.746 --> 01:06:09.008
No.

1081
01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:12.403
Mendax. wings.

1082
01:06:12.577 --> 01:06:14.971
[Mendax bellowing]

1083
01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.496
We'’ll fly north.

1084
01:06:23.501 --> 01:06:27.374
[Pling] ♪ In Distant North
Where ocean bounds♪

1085
01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:31.378
♪ A land alone
Where sky meets ground♪

1086
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.002
Ah. this is the life.

1087
01:06:46.176 --> 01:06:49.353
Sun on my face.
Wind in my hair.

1088
01:06:49.527 --> 01:06:53.096
Oh. what are you talking about?
You don'’t have any hair.

1089
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:54.967
Ugh. you'’re ruining
the moment.

1090
01:06:55.141 --> 01:06:57.230
[sniffs] Smell that air.

1091
01:07:05.412 --> 01:07:06.718
I don'’t like this.

1092
01:07:06.892 --> 01:07:08.285
Oh. try living with him.

1093
01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:09.677
I mean flying.

1094
01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:12.202
[Ergo]
Upon thy wing a king doth ride.

1095
01:07:12.376 --> 01:07:15.727
a perilous flight
to mountain spied.

1096
01:07:15.901 --> 01:07:17.511
Can you stop that?

1097
01:07:17.685 --> 01:07:21.689
"Peril" is not a word one wants
to hear at great heights.

1098
01:07:21.863 --> 01:07:25.128
Statistically speaking.
flying is the safest form
of transport.

1099
01:07:29.001 --> 01:07:30.611
M-Miss Verity.

1100
01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:33.353
Peter. she must not sleep.

1101
01:07:33.527 --> 01:07:35.007
Verity. wake up.

1102
01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:37.227
I'’m really tired.

1103
01:07:37.401 --> 01:07:39.490
Verity.
you have to stay awake.

1104
01:07:39.664 --> 01:07:41.318
[compass whirring]

1105
01:07:41.492 --> 01:07:43.624
Peter. your compass.

1106
01:07:46.453 --> 01:07:49.195
"Where sky meets ground."
The mountain. that'’s it!

1107
01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:51.589
I see it. Your Majesty.

1108
01:07:51.763 --> 01:07:53.504
Come on. Mendax.

1109
01:07:53.678 --> 01:07:55.332
Everyone. hold tight.

1110
01:08:19.878 --> 01:08:21.314
[Mendax bellows]

1111
01:08:32.673 --> 01:08:34.371
This place looks familiar.

1112
01:08:34.545 --> 01:08:36.895
I feel we'’ve been here before.
Don'’t you?

1113
01:08:37.068 --> 01:08:40.202
Absolutely. I concur.
Déjà vu.

1114
01:08:42.857 --> 01:08:44.990
[Verity] Peter.[Peter] Don'’t speak.

1115
01:08:45.164 --> 01:08:48.907
Verity. we'’re here.
There'’s another piece here.

1116
01:08:49.081 --> 01:08:52.606
I'’m so tired. Peter.
I'’m just gonna have a rest.

1117
01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:54.434
No. you can'’t do that.

1118
01:08:54.608 --> 01:08:56.958
You have to stay awake
just a little bit longer.

1119
01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.743
But I can'’t feel my feet.

1120

1122
01:09:04.095 --> 01:09:06.054
Peter. you have to remember.

1123
01:09:06.228 --> 01:09:07.665
Remember what?

1124
01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:09.362
You have to remember me.

1125
01:09:11.059 --> 01:09:13.236
No. no.
Verity. just stay awake.

1126
01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:14.759
Look.
I'’ll be right back.

1127
01:09:16.238 --> 01:09:17.414
Verity?

1128
01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:19.416
Verity. wake up.[inhales]

1129
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:22.593
Mendax. stay with her.
Keep watch.

1130
01:09:22.767 --> 01:09:24.421
Of course. Your Majesty.

1131
01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:27.250
We'’ll stay too.
She shall not sleep.

1132
01:09:27.424 --> 01:09:30.209
There will be no counting
of the sheep.

1133
01:09:30.383 --> 01:09:34.431
Your Majesty.
there is something
I must tell you.

1134
01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:36.215
but I can'’t recall.

1135
01:09:36.389 --> 01:09:39.958
Alas. we'’ve hit a wall.Whatever it is. it has to wait.

1136
01:09:42.352 --> 01:09:43.744
Come on. Pling.

1137
01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:06.463
What do I do?

1138
01:10:07.681 --> 01:10:09.074
I'’m not sure.

1139

[chuckles]

1145
01:10:50.157 --> 01:10:53.074
Oh. okay. I get it now.
It'’s just a game of memory.

1146
01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:55.120
We have to match the symbols.

1147
01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:17.969
[rumbling]Whoa!

1148
01:11:18.665 --> 01:11:19.666
Peter!

[Peter]
Pling. are you okay?

1150
01:11:25.977 --> 01:11:30.373
It seems there may be
consequences to losing.

1151
01:11:31.809 --> 01:11:33.680
I think
you might be right.

1152

Peter.

1156
01:12:13.285 --> 01:12:15.853
Come on. come on.
come on. come on.

1157
01:12:28.909 --> 01:12:30.215
Yeah.

1158
01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.178
Yes!

1159
01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.616
I'’ve got this. I'’ve got this.

1160
01:12:45.056 --> 01:12:47.058
Oh! Whoa! Peter.

1161
01:12:52.019 --> 01:12:55.675
Pling. tell me the part
of the prophecy that says
we don'’t die here.

1162
01:12:57.503 --> 01:13:01.812
Oh. well. in the prophecy.

1163
01:13:01.986 --> 01:13:06.730
the king makes it all the way
to the Citadel. [chuckles]

1164
01:13:06.904 --> 01:13:09.733
Then there'’s nothing
to be afraid of. right?

1165
01:13:09.907 --> 01:13:12.475
Mmm... Uh...

1166
01:13:13.344 --> 01:13:14.781
Um...

1167
01:13:14.955 --> 01:13:16.522
Well... [chuckles]

1168
01:13:16.696 --> 01:13:19.351
...it'’s just that
many of the events

1169
01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:21.571
that have occurred
on our journey

1170
01:13:21.745 --> 01:13:24.617
are not in the prophecy.

1171
01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.315
Wait. so what do you mean?

1172
01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:30.406
The-- The book
and the pieces and...

1173
01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:34.888
Wait. if this isn'’t part
of the prophecy.

1174
01:13:35.062 --> 01:13:38.370
then that means
I'’m not the chosen king.

1175
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.416
I knew it!

1176
01:13:41.286 --> 01:13:42.766
I knew it.

1177
01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.638
I mean. then
why are you still here?
I mean. why?

1178
01:13:45.812 --> 01:13:47.771
Why are you here with me.

1179
01:13:47.945 --> 01:13:49.512
risking your life.

1180
01:13:49.686 --> 01:13:52.514
when you know
that I'’m not the king?

1181
01:13:55.996 --> 01:14:01.262
Because you are my friend.
and...

1182
01:14:02.307 --> 01:14:04.135
and I believe in you.

1183
01:14:09.139 --> 01:14:11.055
Hmm.

1184
01:14:11.228 --> 01:14:13.971
There are two possible
combinations left.

1185
01:14:14.145 --> 01:14:15.233
You can do this.

Oh. please. please. please.

Yes!

01:14:44.218 --> 01:14:46.046
Yes. yes!

1191
01:14:46.219 --> 01:14:47.526
Yes! We did it!

1192
01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.702
[Pling] You did it. Peter.

1193
01:14:57.057 --> 01:14:58.450
[Pling] Oh...

1194
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:06.197
How did you do?

1195
01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:07.546
It wasn'’t there.

1196
01:15:08.808 --> 01:15:11.550
Is it possible
you may have missed it?

1197
01:15:11.724 --> 01:15:14.074
What are you doing?

1198
01:15:14.248 --> 01:15:15.554
Back up. you oaf.

Very well.

Verity. I'’m here.

1203
01:15:37.054 --> 01:15:38.882
You have to see now.

1204
01:15:39.056 --> 01:15:41.275
Peter. you have to see.

1205
01:15:41.449 --> 01:15:43.974
See?
What do I have to see?

1206
01:15:47.368 --> 01:15:49.240
Verity!

1207
01:15:49.414 --> 01:15:50.415

[thunder rumbling]

1213
01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:28.627
A king. he stands
with trouble on high.

1214
01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.151
with heavy heart
and teary eye.

1215
01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:35.416
but to save the truth.
he again must fly.

1216
01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:38.463
Stop it.
Read your audience.

1217
01:16:38.637 --> 01:16:40.552
This is no time
for your dramatics.

1218
01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:42.728
It'’s the requiem.

1219
01:16:42.902 --> 01:16:45.992
my favorite
of all the prophetic prose.

1220
01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:48.952
The next part
is really rather lovely.

1221
01:16:49.126 --> 01:16:50.996
Cathartic. actually.

1222
01:16:51.171 --> 01:16:52.782
Oh. yes! Oh!

1223
01:16:52.956 --> 01:16:53.957
That'’s right!

1224
01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:55.827
I remember now.

1225
01:16:56.002 --> 01:16:58.526
This is the part
where he throws the book.

1226
01:16:58.701 --> 01:16:59.832
Exactly.

1227
01:17:02.182 --> 01:17:03.096
The book!The book!

Oh. Oh. no.

1232

[Ergo] A beautiful moment.

1233
01:17:19.939 --> 01:17:23.116
The death of certainty.

And at the same time.
rebirth.

1235
01:17:26.859 --> 01:17:29.601
Oh! Hurry.
We must tell him the rest.

1236
01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:31.124
The rest of what?

1237
01:17:31.298 --> 01:17:32.735
[Ego] Don'’t go that way.
It'’s too high.

1238
01:17:32.909 --> 01:17:34.562
[Ergo] This way'’s quicker.[Ego] Ow!

1239
01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:35.651
[Ergo] Oh. my!

1240
01:17:35.825 --> 01:17:37.782
[Ego. Ergo grunting]

1241
01:17:40.264 --> 01:17:42.483
I think
we broke something.

1242
01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:43.571
We?

1243
01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.835
You!
You broke something.

1244
01:17:46.009 --> 01:17:48.359
[groans] Get your hand
out of my face.

1245
01:17:48.532 --> 01:17:49.577
You okay?

1246
01:17:51.754 --> 01:17:53.233
The missing piece.

1247
01:17:55.148 --> 01:17:56.628
Ah![snaps fingers]

1248
01:17:56.802 --> 01:17:57.889
That'’s where we put it.

1249
01:17:58.064 --> 01:17:59.805
Oh...You had it all along?

1250
01:17:59.978 --> 01:18:02.503
I'’m sorry. Your Majesty.

1251
01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.375
That'’s what
I was trying to recall.

1252
01:18:04.549 --> 01:18:07.552
I didn'’t know
it was there at all.

1253
01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:09.119
[sighs]

1254
01:18:19.389 --> 01:18:21.958
[screaming]

1255
01:18:22.132 --> 01:18:25.612
[echoing]

1256
01:18:31.794 --> 01:18:33.883
[crying]

1257
01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:47.157
You seem to have dropped this.
Your Majesty.

1258
01:18:57.558 --> 01:18:59.559
The final part.

1259
01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:03.782
[Peter] "In the Citadel awaits.

1260
01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:06.437
a final test. a shrouded fate.

1261
01:19:07.568 --> 01:19:10.309
only the face of truth within."

1262
01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.793
What is it. Peter?

1263
01:19:16.882 --> 01:19:19.450
"Only the face of truth within

1264
01:19:20.364 --> 01:19:22.279
can release a fallen king.

1265
01:19:22.452 --> 01:19:25.237
In the presence of the clock.

1266
01:19:25.412 --> 01:19:27.501
puzzle complete will unlock.

1267
01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:30.200
but only in a king'’s domain.

1268
01:19:30.374 --> 01:19:33.202
shall the key within be gained.

1269
01:19:33.377 --> 01:19:36.206
With tiny key and bravest heart.

1270
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.861
time when wound again
will start."

1271
01:19:39.035 --> 01:19:40.645
[Pling] Oh...

1272
01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:43.996
The prophecy says
that when the great clock
is restored.

1273
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:46.389
the fallen will be released.

1274
01:19:46.564 --> 01:19:47.957
[sighs]

1275
01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:51.482
Mendax.
we'’re going to the Citadel.

1276
01:19:51.656 --> 01:19:53.440
Very well. Your Majesty.

1277
01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:55.486
We shall stay
and watch over her.

1278
01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.794
Besides.
we'’re not really dressed
for the Citadel.

1279
01:20:32.478 --> 01:20:34.612
Where to now?

1280
01:20:34.786 --> 01:20:37.005
We are
in the Treasury Square.

1281
01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:39.660
The tower is located
just ahead.

1282
01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:42.925
Yes.
Yes. that is correct.

1283
01:20:43.099 --> 01:20:46.798
It was here
that the great battle
for The Below was fought.

1284
01:20:47.886 --> 01:20:51.063
You seem to know a lot
about this place.

1285
01:20:51.237 --> 01:20:53.978
Oh. I'’ve heard the stories.

1286
01:20:54.153 --> 01:20:57.678
Your kinfolk
fought most gallantly.
young Pling.

1287
01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:02.945
Although. in the end.
their sacrifice
was rather... unnecessary.

1288
01:21:03.119 --> 01:21:04.903
The gauntlet![Mendax] Indeed.

1289
01:21:05.077 --> 01:21:07.210
The gauntlet?
What gauntlet?

1290
01:21:07.384 --> 01:21:10.691
Armored sentinels
that guard the tower.

1291
01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.389
They are impenetrable.

1292
01:21:12.563 --> 01:21:15.696
And you wait until now
to tell me this?

1293
01:21:16.567 --> 01:21:19.264
I only just remembered.

1294
01:21:20.527 --> 01:21:24.791
Not even the Shroud himself
was able to defeat them.

1295
01:21:24.967 --> 01:21:28.666
Only a true king
will be permitted to pass.

1296
01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:31.059
[Peter] Then this is about
to be over real quick.

1297
01:21:31.234 --> 01:21:32.583
[Mendax]
Come. Your Majesty.

1298
01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:34.454
We'’ve made it this far.

1299
01:21:57.216 --> 01:21:58.870
[whimpering]

1300
01:22:00.089 --> 01:22:01.873
Halt!

1301
01:22:05.702 --> 01:22:08.271
Who goes there?

1302
01:22:09.011 --> 01:22:10.142
[Mendax] My lords.

1303
01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:16.148
I present to you Peter.
King of The Below.

1304
01:22:18.193 --> 01:22:19.325
Eyes.

1305
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:23.634
Hmm... Interesting.

1306
01:22:23.808 --> 01:22:25.201
What is it?

1307
01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:26.811
I believe it'’s a child.

1308
01:22:26.985 --> 01:22:28.508
A mild what?

1309
01:22:28.682 --> 01:22:30.380
No. I said a child.

1310
01:22:30.554 --> 01:22:31.816
I am Peter.

1311
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.904
Ears.

1312
01:22:33.077 --> 01:22:35.210
Yes. sir. Here. sir.

1313
01:22:35.385 --> 01:22:36.864
What is he saying?

1314
01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:39.563
It'’s a child. sir.

1315
01:22:39.737 --> 01:22:41.695
I said. I am Peter.

1316
01:22:41.869 --> 01:22:44.219
I have come to--A child. you say?

1317
01:22:45.047 --> 01:22:46.264
We'’re running out of time.

1318
01:22:46.439 --> 01:22:48.485
I command you to let us pass.

1319
01:22:48.659 --> 01:22:51.009
[gauntlets laughing]

1320
01:22:51.183 --> 01:22:53.272
Let us through. you oafs.

1321
01:22:54.186 --> 01:22:56.406
Oh! Shh. shh. shh.

1322
01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.710
[gauntlet leader]
Forgive us.

1323
01:22:57.885 --> 01:23:00.323
What was that last part again?

1324
01:23:00.496 --> 01:23:02.803
I-- I command you
to let us pass.

1325
01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:04.457
[gauntlets laughing]

1326
01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:07.199
Oh. he'’s thrown down
the gauntlet.

1327
01:23:07.373 --> 01:23:08.853
You gotta
hand it to him.

1328
01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:10.637
He must have
some big hands.

1329
01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:12.291
You know what they say--

1330
01:23:12.465 --> 01:23:14.598
Big hands. big glass.Big glass.

1331
01:23:14.772 --> 01:23:16.773
[gauntlets laugh]

1332
01:23:16.948 --> 01:23:18.950
The prophecy must be fulfilled.

1333
01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:20.125
Mendax.

1334
01:23:20.299 --> 01:23:22.171
That beast
has no power here.

1335
01:23:22.344 --> 01:23:23.781
[growls]

1336
01:23:23.955 --> 01:23:26.218
Get ahold of yourselves.
You are in the presence of--

1337
01:23:26.392 --> 01:23:28.742
Only the king shall pass.

1338
01:23:28.916 --> 01:23:31.180
Well. I am that king.

1339
01:23:31.353 --> 01:23:32.442
[ears] Boss...

1340
01:23:32.616 --> 01:23:34.618
[gauntlets whispering]

1341
01:23:36.794 --> 01:23:41.973
A false claim of kinghood
is punishable by death.

1342
01:23:47.239 --> 01:23:50.808
If you are the king.
you will prove your power.

1343
01:23:50.982 --> 01:23:53.767
or you will be destroyed.

1344
01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:56.770
[growls]

1345
01:23:56.943 --> 01:23:59.077
Well. how do I prove my power?

1346
01:23:59.251 --> 01:24:01.427
A king does not ask how.

1347
01:24:01.601 --> 01:24:03.255
Oh...

1348
01:24:03.429 --> 01:24:04.603
[Peter] Then I--

1349
01:24:04.778 --> 01:24:07.693
I-- I challenge you to a game.

1350
01:24:08.608 --> 01:24:11.742
[grunts]What sort of game?

1351
01:24:12.351 --> 01:24:14.614
A game of...

1352
01:24:15.876 --> 01:24:16.790
Oh...

1353
01:24:16.964 --> 01:24:18.879
...rock. paper. scissors.

1354
01:24:20.838 --> 01:24:24.059
Challenge accepted.

1355
01:24:26.496 --> 01:24:27.540
Oh.

1356
01:24:27.714 --> 01:24:29.368
Three rounds.

1357
01:24:29.541 --> 01:24:31.501
Best of three.

1358
01:24:31.675 --> 01:24:35.374
If you win. you shall pass.

1359
01:24:35.548 --> 01:24:39.465
If you do not. you shall perish.

1360
01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:41.293
Okay. We throw on three.

1361
01:24:41.467 --> 01:24:43.425
Acceptable.

1362
01:24:45.818 --> 01:24:46.864
[Peter] One.

1363
01:24:48.039 --> 01:24:49.084
Two.

1364
01:24:49.867 --> 01:24:51.041
Three.

1365
01:24:51.912 --> 01:24:53.827
He'’s gone scissors.

1366
01:24:54.001 --> 01:24:55.264
We saw that one coming.

1367
01:24:55.438 --> 01:24:58.005
Blind Freddy
could see that one coming.

1368
01:24:58.180 --> 01:24:59.094
No. I couldn'’t.

1369
01:24:59.268 --> 01:25:01.531
That is one point.
us.

1370
01:25:01.705 --> 01:25:03.141
Oh...

1371
01:25:05.796 --> 01:25:07.058
One.

1372
01:25:08.277 --> 01:25:09.278
Two.

1373
01:25:10.322 --> 01:25:12.368
Three.

1374
01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:16.285
That is two points. us.But scissors beats paper.

1375
01:25:16.459 --> 01:25:18.243
Two points. us.

1376
01:25:18.416 --> 01:25:21.855
That'’s cheating.All decisions are final.

1377
01:25:23.205 --> 01:25:26.251
You have one turn left.

1378
01:25:26.425 --> 01:25:28.253
[growling]

1379
01:25:28.427 --> 01:25:31.648
Maybe don'’t go scissors again.

1380
01:25:32.692 --> 01:25:33.824
[Peter] One.

1381
01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:36.522
[sighs]

1382
01:25:37.827 --> 01:25:39.612
Hurry up. child.

1383
01:25:43.268 --> 01:25:44.965
Stop stalling.

1384
01:25:46.184 --> 01:25:47.620
[sighs]

1385
01:25:47.794 --> 01:25:49.056
One.

1386
01:25:51.102 --> 01:25:52.147
Two.

1387
01:25:54.236 --> 01:25:55.237
Three.

1388
01:25:56.455 --> 01:25:57.891
What is that?

1389
01:25:58.065 --> 01:25:59.241
[Peter]
It'’s dynamite.

1390
01:25:59.415 --> 01:26:00.503
[gauntlet] Dynamite?He'’s cheating.

1391
01:26:00.677 --> 01:26:01.764
Fall in.

1392
01:26:03.897 --> 01:26:05.072
Attack.

1393
01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:22.829
[Pling] Oh. my goodness.

1394
01:26:46.897 --> 01:26:48.246
[sighs]

1395
01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:50.987
"In the presence of a clock.

1396
01:26:51.162 --> 01:26:53.382
puzzle complete will unlock.

1397
01:26:53.556 --> 01:26:55.645
but only in a king'’s domain.

1398
01:26:55.818 --> 01:26:58.082
shall the key within be gained.

With tiny key and bravest heart.

1401
01:27:09.267 --> 01:27:11.226
[growling quietly]

1402
01:27:23.673 --> 01:27:25.022
Almost there.

1403
01:27:31.681 --> 01:27:33.900
I-I don'’t understand.

1404
01:27:37.425 --> 01:27:38.775
Why isn'’t it working?

1405
01:27:42.387 --> 01:27:43.910
You'’ve come this far. Peter.

1406
01:27:44.084 --> 01:27:47.349
Maybe-- Maybe I just have
to think outside the box.

1407
01:27:47.523 --> 01:27:50.177
There'’s
that peculiar saying again.

1408
01:27:50.352 --> 01:27:53.005
I'’m still not sure
I understand it.

1409
01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:56.575
It means to
see something differently.

1410
01:27:56.749 --> 01:27:58.577
to find a new solution.

1411
01:28:02.059 --> 01:28:05.148
Uh. Pling. do you know
what a king'’s domain is?

1412
01:28:05.323 --> 01:28:09.066
Uh. I'’m not sure
I understand the question.

1413
01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:10.937
A king'’s domain...

1414
01:28:14.157 --> 01:28:15.072
is a castle.

1415
01:28:15.246 --> 01:28:16.291
[puzzle clicks]

1416
01:28:16.465 --> 01:28:17.987
[Pling] Oh. my!

1417
01:28:18.162 --> 01:28:19.728
[chuckles]

1418
01:28:25.735 --> 01:28:29.869
[chuckles] That is how
you think outside the box.

1419
01:28:30.434 --> 01:28:31.523
[chuckles]

1420
01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:39.096
Pling-- [gasps]

1421
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:40.967
[Peter breathing heavily]

1422
01:28:41.141 --> 01:28:42.186
Pling.

1423
01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.407
[Mendax]
Well done. Your Majesty.

1424
01:28:45.581 --> 01:28:47.496
Mendax? What have you done?

1425
01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:51.021
Fear is such a powerful emotion.

1426
01:28:51.195 --> 01:28:54.111
It can literally
make you freeze.

1427
01:28:55.242 --> 01:28:56.374
What are you?

1428
01:28:56.548 --> 01:28:59.290
I am the sands of time.

1429
01:28:59.464 --> 01:29:01.987
I am the chains that bind.

1430
01:29:02.162 --> 01:29:05.209
I am everything you do not see.

1431
01:29:05.383 --> 01:29:08.517
I am what you make of me.

1432
01:29:08.691 --> 01:29:09.822
You'’re the Shroud!

1433
01:29:09.996 --> 01:29:11.520
Yes.

1434
01:29:11.693 --> 01:29:14.523
You are indeed
a wise little king.

1435
01:29:14.697 --> 01:29:16.960
You lied to me!
I thought you were my friend!

1436
01:29:17.134 --> 01:29:20.920
You used me!
You used me to get the pieces
and to find the key!

1437
01:29:21.094 --> 01:29:23.619
[the Shroud]
And still you do not see.

1438
01:29:23.793 --> 01:29:24.924
Why have you done this?

1439
01:29:25.098 --> 01:29:26.752
You did this. Peter.

1440
01:29:27.492 --> 01:29:29.364
You made me.

1441
01:29:30.059 --> 01:29:32.932
I am your fear.

1442
01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.545
But I could be so much more.

1443
01:29:38.329 --> 01:29:40.549
For I can become anger.

1444
01:29:41.288 --> 01:29:43.421
I can become rage.

1445
01:29:44.639 --> 01:29:46.772
I know what pains you. Peter.

1446
01:29:48.557 --> 01:29:51.429
I know what you keep
buried below.

1447
01:29:51.603 --> 01:29:52.691
Show yourself!

1448
01:29:52.865 --> 01:29:54.389
[the Shroud]
What form shall I take?

1449
01:29:54.563 --> 01:29:56.565
[Verity screams][high-pitched ringing]

1450
01:29:56.739 --> 01:29:59.002
Show yourself. you coward!

1451
01:29:59.175 --> 01:30:01.004
[the Shroud] Coward?

1452
01:30:01.178 --> 01:30:04.442
If I show myself
in three seconds.
nothing bad will happen. right?

1453
01:30:06.313 --> 01:30:08.011
I command you to show yourself!

1454
01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:10.969
Will I? Won'’t I?

1455
01:30:12.014 --> 01:30:14.452
What does the prophecy say?

1456
01:30:14.626 --> 01:30:18.717
What happens next?[clock chimes. distorted]

1457
01:30:18.891 --> 01:30:20.719
Looking for something?

1458
01:30:24.636 --> 01:30:27.030
Watch out for the cracks. Peter.

1459
01:30:32.035 --> 01:30:33.645
[growls]

1460
01:30:43.655 --> 01:30:45.614
[heartbeat thumping]

1461
01:30:46.963 --> 01:30:50.923
With each panicked breath.
each frenzied heartbeat.

1462
01:30:51.097 --> 01:30:52.838
I grow stronger.

1463
01:30:54.187 --> 01:30:56.146
Let me be more.

1464
01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:01.151
Let me free of this Below
and let me be all
you need me to be.

1465
01:31:05.242 --> 01:31:07.766
[heart rate monitor beeping]

1466
01:31:12.858 --> 01:31:14.556
What do you see. Peter?

1467
01:31:18.734 --> 01:31:20.518
[Peter] Verity! Wait![beeping intensifies]

1468
01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:22.302
[whispers] It'’s magic.

1469
01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:27.916
[heart rate monitor flatlines]

1470
01:31:28.091 --> 01:31:32.182
[David]
It'’s only been a year. and I'’m
still dealing with this.

1471
01:31:32.356 --> 01:31:34.489
[Vivianne]
This family loses too much.

1472
01:31:35.664 --> 01:31:36.752
[Peter] Verity!

1473
01:31:36.925 --> 01:31:37.927
No!

1474
01:31:52.681 --> 01:31:55.771
So now you see.

1475
01:31:55.945 --> 01:31:59.514
The clock
will never be restored.
The time before is over.

1476
01:31:59.688 --> 01:32:02.691
Only I can give you
the control you crave.

1477
01:32:02.865 --> 01:32:04.648
You need me.

1478
01:32:04.823 --> 01:32:06.912
I control you.

1479
01:32:07.085 --> 01:32:08.740
I own you.

1480
01:32:08.914 --> 01:32:10.437
Not anymore.

1481
01:32:11.221 --> 01:32:13.353
I own me.

1482
01:32:21.361 --> 01:32:24.059
[the Shroud groaning]

1483
01:32:33.416 --> 01:32:35.853
[breathing heavily]

1484
01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.085
[lock clicks]

1485
01:33:20.377 --> 01:33:21.857
[metallic creaking]

1486
01:33:31.127 --> 01:33:32.955
[metallic creaking]

1487
01:33:33.129 --> 01:33:34.652
[machine clicks]

1488
01:33:37.002 --> 01:33:39.222
[metallic creaking]

1489
01:33:43.052 --> 01:33:44.531
[clock ticks]

1490
01:33:49.058 --> 01:33:51.800
[metallic creaking]

1491
01:33:52.583 --> 01:33:54.933
[clock chiming]

1492
01:34:11.776 --> 01:34:12.777
[grunts]

1493
01:34:16.476 --> 01:34:17.782
It'’s over. Pling.

1494
01:34:19.915 --> 01:34:21.351
Oh. my.

1495
01:34:22.308 --> 01:34:24.005
It'’s done.

1496
01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:25.442
[Pling chuckles]

1497
01:34:34.407 --> 01:34:37.193
It is as the prophecy foretold.

1498
01:34:42.415 --> 01:34:44.504
I told you
we were underdressed.

1499
01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:47.377
You said
a tire was suitable.

1500
01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:51.294
No. I said we needed
suitable attire.

1501
01:34:51.947 --> 01:34:53.077
[Ergo groans]

1502
01:34:53.252 --> 01:34:54.123
Hello.Hello.

1503
01:34:54.297 --> 01:34:55.341
Verity!

1504
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:59.084
I'’m proud of you.

1505
01:34:59.258 --> 01:35:00.825
You did the brave thing.

1506
01:35:00.999 --> 01:35:02.827
You saw
what you needed to see.

1507
01:35:13.446 --> 01:35:16.188
Does this mean
I get to be queen now.
Mr. Pling?

1508
01:35:17.537 --> 01:35:20.976
Yes. Miss Verity.

1509
01:35:28.723 --> 01:35:30.986
You have to let me go now.
Peter.

1510
01:36:00.842 --> 01:36:03.758
Yeah. mate. we'’re gonna have
this room fixed up
before you know it.

1511
01:36:04.628 --> 01:36:05.803
Did you do--

1512
01:36:05.977 --> 01:36:07.718
I guess the light
got in.

1513
01:36:09.154 --> 01:36:13.724
Dad. close your eyes
and tell me what you see.

1514
01:36:13.898 --> 01:36:16.379
[chuckles]
Okay. so. it was crazy.

1515
01:36:16.553 --> 01:36:19.208
Um. I was sitting on the bed.
just in the middle of the night.

1516
01:36:19.382 --> 01:36:21.993
and suddenly.
it fell down straight through.

1517
01:37:42.813 --> 01:37:43.945
[Pling] Uh...

1518
01:37:44.119 --> 01:37:48.123
[humming vocal warm-up notes]

1519
01:37:52.388 --> 01:37:55.826
[continues humming notes]

1520
01:37:58.219 --> 01:37:59.656
Oh. oh. oh. Uh--
