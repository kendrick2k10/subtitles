because it doesn't do anything
for you.

180
00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:21.105
You need to take Allegra.

181
00:12:21.139 --> 00:12:22.606
Oh. right. Yes.

182
00:12:22.706 --> 00:12:24.509
You need Allegra for the
decongestant.

183
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.478
but actually you should take
Benadril at night.

184
00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:39.423
Do that for like three days and
that should clear up.

185
00:12:39.524 --> 00:12:46.465
Okay. Perfect. Okay. Awesome.
Oh. I'm going to go walk over to the CVS.

186
00:12:46.498 --> 00:12:48.934
Honey. why don't you see if
Josh could give you a ride.

187
00:12:48.966 --> 00:12:52.002
you probably shouldn't be
walking around. You should rest.

188
00:12:52.102 --> 00:12:54.973
Yeah. Maybe I'll check with him.

189
00:12:55.006 --> 00:12:55.540
Okay.

190
00:13:00.812 --> 00:13:02.181
You okay?

191
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.583
Yeah. I'm just not feeling
well and it's super frustrating.

192
00:13:05.616 --> 00:13:10.221
But I'm going to go ask Josh if
he can take me to the CVS.

193
00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:12.857
So I got to go.

194
00:13:13.725 --> 00:13:15.561
<i>Okay. bye sweet boy.</i>

195
00:13:19.663 --> 00:13:22.902
Okay. Goodnight. I love you.

196
00:13:22.934 --> 00:13:23.934
<i>I love you.</i>

197
00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:25.171
I love you too. Okay. bye.

198
00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:47.026
Oh. no. No wait.
No wait. No wait.

199
00:13:59.871 --> 00:14:05.209
Can you leave and don't tell
anybody about this.

200
00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:07.012
Okay.

201
00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:10.649
And I'm going to
be going through a rough patch.

202
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:25.931
Little third grade Brade Duper.

203
00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:30.469

No. I'm fine. I'm fine.

209
00:14:39.076 --> 00:14:41.713
I'm not going to throw up. I'm
not going to fucking.

210
00:14:41.746 --> 00:14:42.613
You're going to throw-.

211
00:14:42.714 --> 00:14:43.748
No. I'm not going to throw up.

212
00:14:43.847 --> 00:14:45.450
shut the fuck up.

213
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.185
Shut. the fuck. up.

214
00:14:47.217 --> 00:14:48.886
You suck. you suck. you suck.

00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:51.955
Get it? Got it? Get it?

216
00:14:52.056 --> 00:14:54.559
Jerry Seinfeld thinks you suck.

217
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:55.860
I think you suck.

218
00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:58.697
What's the deal with shitty
roommates?

219
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.231
It's never a good one. there's
never.

220
00:15:00.264 --> 00:15:03.600

Bitch. bitch. bitch.

221
00:15:03.701 --> 00:15:05.870
Oh. but I don't want a roommate.

224
00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:12.577
Do you want me
to get you some water?

225
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.913
No. Yeah. I got water.

226
00:15:15.947 --> 00:15:18.750
That's a huge bottle of vodka.

No. it's fucking water.

228
00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:22.488

Get hugs from Mom and Jess.

231
00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:21.479
Why is God so hard?

232
00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:29.721
I feel like I'm just. like...
Floating and nobody like.

233
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.058

234
00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:52.778

I know they are your good pants
but you pooped in them.

246
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.846
We need to at least get up and
go in the shower.

247
00:17:27.878 --> 00:17:31.416
No. I didn't do nothing.

248
00:17:32.049 --> 00:17:33.951

Right now you can. Did you get
kicked out of your room?

255
00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:56.240
Yeah. Yeah. Did you?

256
00:17:56.273 --> 00:17:58.209
Oh. no. R. E.'s get singles?

so I just can't sleep.

259
00:18:06.917 --> 00:18:08.652
What was on your shirt?

260
00:18:08.752 --> 00:18:13.157
Oh. I actually have it on still.

261
00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:21.700
It just says. It says "The time

262
00:18:21.799 --> 00:18:23.534
Cool.

263
00:18:24.635 --> 00:18:27.271

00:19:03.307 --> 00:19:08.814
The Grand Canyon?
Do you have a car?

277
00:19:08.846 --> 00:19:10.748
What? I'm talking about

278
00:19:10.781 --> 00:19:14.351

out there instead of here.

279
00:19:14.385 --> 00:19:15.586
Oh.

Oh.

00:19:24.095 --> 00:19:26.163
Is that what you're asking?

283
00:19:26.196 --> 00:19:28.933
I guess so.

284
00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:32.371
Do you even know my name?

285
00:19:34.105 --> 00:19:36.842
What's your name?

286
00:19:37.107 --> 00:19:39.411

287
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.614
Why? I'll tell you my name.

Why are you making me feel bad?

292
00:19:49.887 --> 00:19:51.188
Because you should feel bad.

293
00:19:51.222 --> 00:19:53.758

room. though.

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:39.270
Yeah. Just put it down right
here?

305
00:20:45.544 --> 00:20:48.714
I just ruined your room by
doing that.

306
00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:55.987
Is it always this clean or is
this just a Friday thing?

307
00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:57.455
It's always this clean.

308
00:20:58.756 --> 00:21:05.830
I don't think I've made my bed
in like ever. probably.

309
00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.267
I recommend it.

310
00:21:12.703 --> 00:21:14.839
Can I have some of this wine
that's here?

311
00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:17.342
Oh. yeah. I know. You can just have
all of it. I have. like a ton of it.

312
00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:18.942
Well. there's a ton in here.

Are you 21?

318
00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:37.995
No. I have a fake ID.

319
00:21:38.095 --> 00:21:39.931
I'm 19. but I just can get it.

320
00:21:39.963 --> 00:21:45.971

birthday a couple of weeks ago.

321
00:21:46.837 --> 00:21:50.274
Cool. Happy belated birthday.

Thanks.

325
00:22:02.319 --> 00:22:05.289
How do you get a fake ID?

326
00:22:05.323 --> 00:22:08.492
It's a really complicated
process that I

327
00:22:08.526 --> 00:22:12.163
feel like we should talk about
another time.

328
00:22:12.195 --> 00:22:14.398
Okay.

329
00:22:15.532 --> 00:22:17.701

A lot of things

336
00:23:37.515 --> 00:23:38.917
Take your shirt off too.

337
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:39.683
Okay.

00:25:18.982 --> 00:25:23.221
Okay. that's fine. That's okay.
lay down.

345
00:25:26.557 --> 00:25:28.526

I'm really sorry.

349
00:25:45.509 --> 00:25:48.313
No. don't be. It's okay.

350
00:25:52.849 --> 00:25:56.620

I'm going to skedaddle.

355
00:26:13.337 --> 00:26:16.774
You don't have to. I'm going to
be awake if you want to hang out.

356
00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:19.176
I was going to stay up and
drink wine.

357
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.346
I'm just saying you don't have
to leave right now.

358
00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:23.314
I'm going to be awake.

359
00:26:23.414 --> 00:26:24.615
Are you sure?

360
00:26:24.647 --> 00:26:26.650
Yeah. I would feel weird if I
drink alone.

361
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.817
but I feel like it could help
me sleep.

362
00:26:27.917 --> 00:26:29.653
so I was thinking that could be
good but

363
00:26:29.753 --> 00:26:32.589
also go. I feel like you were
trying to go.

364
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:37.761
No. I wasn't. I thought it's because
I didn't. I would love to stay.

365
00:26:37.795 --> 00:26:39.197
Okay. You don't have to.

366
00:26:39.297 --> 00:26:41.566
No. I'd really like to.

367
00:26:41.598 --> 00:26:42.832
Okay.

368
00:26:42.866 --> 00:26:45.368
I can Venmo you by the way. I
will Venmo you.

369
00:26:45.603 --> 00:26:48.305
No. it's fine. This is $5 at
Target.

370
00:26:48.405 --> 00:26:49.440
You have a car?

371
00:26:49.472 --> 00:26:51.509
No. I walk there.

372
00:26:51.608 --> 00:26:56.780
I don't have a car either.
Kinda sucks. right?

373
00:26:56.814 --> 00:26:59.383
I like walking. but yeah. in
general.

374
00:26:59.583 --> 00:27:00.851
you want to make a friend with
a car.

375
00:27:00.951 --> 00:27:04.855
Yeah. None of
my friends have cars.

376
00:27:11.662 --> 00:27:13.298
So you're a sophomore. right?

377
00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.634
Yeah.

378
00:27:17.567 --> 00:27:23.641
Did you. did you have a tough
first year?

379
00:27:23.674 --> 00:27:27.478
What do you mean. like
adjusting?

380
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.414
Yeah. In general.

381
00:27:31.315 --> 00:27:34.818
I don't know. Not really. why?

382
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.956
I am.

383
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:43.794
Yeah. I mean. I think everybody
struggles at first.

384
00:27:43.827 --> 00:27:47.330
Yeah. I'm struggling now.

385
00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:50.233
What's going on?

386
00:27:50.334 --> 00:27:51.402
Can I tell you a secret?

387
00:27:51.501 --> 00:27:52.336
Sure.

388
00:27:52.369 --> 00:27:54.471
I have zero friends.

389
00:27:54.704 --> 00:27:56.707
You just said you have friends.

390
00:27:56.807 --> 00:27:58.041
You said your friends don't
have cars.

391
00:27:58.142 --> 00:28:00.878
They don't have cars' cause
they're not real.

392
00:28:00.978 --> 00:28:02.880
You don't have zero friends.

393
00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.450
I definitely have zero friends.

394
00:28:05.982 --> 00:28:09.185
Like. you could say my roommate.

395
00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.453
Sam is a friend.

396
00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:15.293
but we hate each other and
aren't friends.

397
00:28:15.393 --> 00:28:17.461
Who do you hang out with?

398
00:28:19.262 --> 00:28:22.699
Timothy from the marketplace. I
hang out with.

399
00:28:22.732 --> 00:28:24.268
Like. thirty seconds a day.

400
00:28:24.468 --> 00:28:27.504
And. to be honest. I hang out
with my stuffed animal from

401
00:28:27.538 --> 00:28:30.708
home a lot. I talk to him.

402
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.711
That's not true. I don't talk
to him.

403
00:28:33.743 --> 00:28:35.879
I more of just like spent a lot
of time in

404
00:28:35.913 --> 00:28:39.750
my room and my stuffed animals
in the room.

405
00:28:39.849 --> 00:28:43.487
I'm exaggerating.

406
00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:46.891
I have friends.

407
00:28:46.923 --> 00:28:49.326
but are those two of my closest
friends

408
00:28:49.426 --> 00:28:52.496
at college 100 percent.

409
00:28:57.167 --> 00:29:01.705
But it's okay because Timothy
is fucking awesome.

410
00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:02.940
I really like Timothy a lot.

411
00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:04.576
He's the warmest guy of all
time.

412
00:29:04.608 --> 00:29:06.510
He makes me feel so good every
day.

413
00:29:06.743 --> 00:29:08.711
He makes my skin feels good
when he talks.

414
00:29:08.746 --> 00:29:09.580
- I know what you mean.
- Yeah.

415
00:29:09.613 --> 00:29:10.480
Yeah.

416
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.514
Also devastatingly good-looking.

417
00:29:11.714 --> 00:29:12.448
That's part of it.

418
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:14.617
Yeah. For sure.

419
00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:17.188
Take this back.

420
00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:24.528
My turtle died today.

421
00:29:25.095 --> 00:29:28.598
Is that was supposed to be in
that tank on your desk?

422
00:29:28.632 --> 00:29:30.268
Mmhmm.

423
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.375
I'm really sorry. That sucks.

424
00:29:37.474 --> 00:29:39.209
Thanks.

425
00:29:44.214 --> 00:29:47.250
I thought turtles were supposed
to like live forever.

426
00:29:47.284 --> 00:29:51.188
I did also and they don't. they
just die.

427
00:29:51.288 --> 00:29:53.223
What happened?

428
00:29:53.324 --> 00:29:55.459
I don't really know.

429
00:29:55.558 --> 00:30:01.465
He hadn't been eating so I
think he was sick or something

430
00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:03.934
and then he got stuck when I

431
00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:06.571
wasn't here maybe or when
swimming.

432
00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:12.143
was weak and drowned. I don't
know what happened.

433
00:30:13.309 --> 00:30:17.313
So. you've had. like a really
sad day.

434
00:30:17.748 --> 00:30:22.353
Yeah. I mean. whatever is just
a turtle.

435
00:30:22.385 --> 00:30:25.923
Yeah. he was my buddy.

436
00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.560
What was his name?

437
00:30:30.661 --> 00:30:31.895
Pete.

438
00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:34.031
That's a really good name for a
turtle.

439
00:30:34.131 --> 00:30:37.535
Thank you. It means rock. the
name Pete.

440
00:30:37.634 --> 00:30:39.269
Rock?

441
00:30:39.804 --> 00:30:40.905
Yes.

442
00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:42.640
That was pretty fitting?

443
00:30:42.673 --> 00:30:44.541
Yeah.

444
00:30:45.643 --> 00:30:48.512
Like he was a rock in life?

445
00:30:48.546 --> 00:30:49.814
Mmhmm.

446
00:30:49.846 --> 00:30:52.083
He held down the fort.

447
00:31:00.891 --> 00:31:02.727
I wish I could have met him.

448
00:31:02.826 --> 00:31:04.228
You know what? Same. I feel

449
00:31:04.327 --> 00:31:06.931
- like you guys that have really hit it off.
- Really?

450
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:12.102
Yeah. He was
really sensitive also.

451
00:31:15.204 --> 00:31:17.708
What did you do with the body?

452
00:31:17.741 --> 00:31:19.943
Sorry. that's inconsiderate to
ask.

453
00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:22.846
I threw him away.

454
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.116
You what?

455
00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:30.488
I threw him in the dumpster in
the back of.

456
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.888
I can't tell if you're being
serious right now.

457
00:31:31.922 --> 00:31:32.855
What do you mean?

458
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.658
You threw him away?

459
00:31:34.857 --> 00:31:36.793
Yeah. What else did I have done?

460
00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:39.962
You threw Pete away in the
dumpster?

461
00:31:40.063 --> 00:31:45.969
The Pete who you-your rock in
life. Pete?

462
00:31:46.068 --> 00:31:48.038
Yeah. I put him in a shoe box.

463
00:31:48.071 --> 00:31:51.274
Oh my God. that doesn't make it
any better. What?

464
00:31:51.307 --> 00:31:52.943
Okay.

465
00:31:53.576 --> 00:31:55.913
Didn't you want to bury him?

466
00:31:55.945 --> 00:31:57.414
Okay. you need to calm down.

467
00:31:57.515 --> 00:32:00.751
You can't just throw him away
in a dumpster.

468
00:32:00.784 --> 00:32:02.520
you can just get rid of him.

469
00:32:02.619 --> 00:32:03.987
What?

470
00:32:04.087 --> 00:32:05.423
You're never going to know
where his little body ends up.

471
00:32:05.455 --> 00:32:07.190
I don't want to know where his
little body ends up.

472
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:08.326
Why?

473
00:32:08.425 --> 00:32:09.926
Because he's dead. what?

474
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.363
Oh my God. you're a monster.

475
00:32:12.462 --> 00:32:14.531
I'm not a monster.

476
00:32:14.632 --> 00:32:16.933
Okay. you're not a monster.

477
00:32:16.967 --> 00:32:22.774
But I feel like we should. we
should...

478
00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:24.142
But did you put him in the
dumpster today?

479
00:32:24.174 --> 00:32:25.742
Mmhmm.

480
00:32:25.776 --> 00:32:26.710
Because it's like ice water?

481
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:28.746
Yeah. and it's in your fucking
face.

482
00:32:28.778 --> 00:32:29.613
Yeah.

483
00:32:29.712 --> 00:32:30.815
I've thought about just not

484
00:32:30.914 --> 00:32:32.148
showering for the rest of my
time here.

485
00:32:32.182 --> 00:32:33.951
Oh my God. no. You're going to
get used to it.

486
00:32:33.984 --> 00:32:35.685
You've actually
gotten used to it?

487
00:32:35.786 --> 00:32:37.120
No. I feel like I've gotten
used to

488
00:32:37.153 --> 00:32:38.789
the fact that I'm not going to
get used to it.

489
00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:39.657
You know what I mean?

490
00:32:39.757 --> 00:32:40.758
Mmhmm.

491
00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:41.825
I don't know. I've been
exercising though.

492
00:32:42.058 --> 00:32:43.192
and I feel like that really
helps

493
00:32:43.292 --> 00:32:45.161
with the shower. Have you ever
tried that?

494
00:32:45.195 --> 00:32:46.798
No.

495
00:32:46.897 --> 00:32:49.265
Like. I don't know. I just go. I do the
elliptical thing and it's like really easy.

496
00:32:49.299 --> 00:32:51.034
I just go to the gym in
Burkas.

497
00:32:51.134 --> 00:32:52.736
There's a gym in Burkas?

498
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.337
Yeah. Freshmen. Oh my God.

499
00:32:54.438 --> 00:32:57.942
Yeah. Okay. Are you entirely
sure?

500
00:32:57.974 --> 00:33:00.211
I'm entirely sure. Hold my wine.

501
00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:09.720
Oh. gosh. Having a little
trouble.

502
00:33:09.819 --> 00:33:10.520
Okay.

503
00:33:11.655 --> 00:33:14.057
Ow. why did you push me?

504
00:33:14.157 --> 00:33:15.325
I don't know. you're having
trouble.

505
00:33:15.358 --> 00:33:19.696
You just wanted to touch my
butt. Okay.

506
00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:21.565
Do you see anything?

507
00:33:21.932 --> 00:33:25.769
Yeah. I got my eyes on water
bottles.

508
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.072
That's not trash. that's
recycle.

509
00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:33.043
Making these. wait is Pete
really small?

510
00:33:33.143 --> 00:33:34.010
Yeah. do you see him.

511
00:33:34.111 --> 00:33:35.813
Alright Pete. you are so stiff.

512
00:33:35.846 --> 00:33:37.079
I'm feeling like spooked right
now.

513
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.350
Don't be. can I just see him.

514
00:33:43.953 --> 00:33:45.789
Is this the shoe box?

515
00:33:46.022 --> 00:33:47.391
Yeah.

516
00:33:52.895 --> 00:33:56.399
Okay. what'd you decide?
Where we off to?

517
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.103
Think I'm gonna bury him on the
top of Mount Fiji. if that's okay.

518
00:33:59.202 --> 00:34:01.939
Yes. what? Like in Japan?

519
00:34:02.038 --> 00:34:04.240
No. it's Mount Fuji. What? No.
I'm talking

520
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.442
about Mount Fiji like the
mountain on top of campus.

521
00:34:06.542 --> 00:34:07.911
Oh. yes.

522
00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:09.280
Oh It's called Mount Fiji.

523
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:09.981
Yeah.

524
00:34:10.081 --> 00:34:11.481
Cool. that's much easier.

525
00:34:15.918 --> 00:34:16.820
L.A.?

526
00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:19.890
Yeah. like this campus. like
College.

527
00:34:19.922 --> 00:34:22.925
Yeah. why? Is it?

528
00:34:23.025 --> 00:34:25.462
No. it was nice hearing at Will.

529
00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:27.265
Where are you from?

530
00:34:27.297 --> 00:34:28.899
Dallas.

531
00:34:28.932 --> 00:34:30.835
Okay. so you're from Texas. I
feel like.

532
00:34:31.068 --> 00:34:32.403
you're like 1500 miles away

533
00:34:32.436 --> 00:34:33.804
from our house of course it's a
bit like your home.

534
00:34:33.903 --> 00:34:35.338
Okay. yeah where are you from?

535
00:34:35.438 --> 00:34:36.639
Bay area.

536
00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:38.908
That's like 500 miles away?

537
00:34:38.943 --> 00:34:40.111
Yes. like 400.

538
00:34:40.143 --> 00:34:42.979
Yeah. so you went far away from
home too?

539
00:34:43.079 --> 00:34:45.583
We both like. got

540
00:34:45.682 --> 00:34:48.085
dropped off in a place we don't
know anybody.

541
00:34:48.117 --> 00:34:49.453
and at the end of each day.

542
00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:55.092
we can't go home to our
parent's unconditional love.

543
00:34:55.125 --> 00:34:58.295
It's like we're
newborn babies here.

544
00:34:58.394 --> 00:35:02.298
But we don't have anybody to
hold us.

545
00:35:02.398 --> 00:35:07.538
What? Dude. I don't feel like a
newborn baby. I don't know.

546
00:35:07.637 --> 00:35:08.672
I got carried away.

547
00:35:08.771 --> 00:35:10.007
Yeah.

548
00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:11.208
I think kind of drunk right now
from the wine.

549
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.708
I think you're very drunk from
the wine.

550
00:35:12.809 --> 00:35:13.945
Okay. sue me.

551
00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:15.846
Are you in any clubs?

552
00:35:15.945 --> 00:35:18.248
No. are you?

553
00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:21.351
No. I have friends. Okay. so
you know

554
00:35:21.451 --> 00:35:23.119
how like people think squirrels
are dumb

555
00:35:23.152 --> 00:35:24.888
because they run out of the
street and stuff?

556
00:35:25.088 --> 00:35:26.257
Yeah.

557
00:35:26.289 --> 00:35:27.490
I read an article one time and
said like

558
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.426
squirrels are actually really
smart

559
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.096
because the way you measure
intelligence is by how

560
00:35:32.128 --> 00:35:33.329
well an animal can adapt to

561
00:35:33.429 --> 00:35:35.632
their surroundings. you know
what I mean?

562
00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:40.137
Was that pointed?

563
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:41.806
What. you think I'm
dumb because I'm having

564
00:35:41.838 --> 00:35:43.007
a tough time at College?

565
00:35:43.106 --> 00:35:45.909
No. I think you think
other people just turn

566
00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:47.345
their brain off when they get
here?

567
00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:49.913
Yeah. that's literally exactly
what I think.

568
00:35:50.146 --> 00:35:51.614
Like that's a perfect way of
putting it.

569
00:35:51.648 --> 00:35:53.317
I'm trying to tell you that's
not turning

570
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:55.485
your brain off like that is
being intelligent.

571
00:35:55.518 --> 00:35:58.187
Okay well. I disagree with you
because you said it's how

572
00:35:58.288 --> 00:36:00.791
well they adapt and make use of
the place they're in.

573
00:36:00.824 --> 00:36:02.659
and what I'm telling you is
that people aren't

574
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.062
taking advantage of the place
that they're in.

575
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:06.297
What do you mean?

576
00:36:06.329 --> 00:36:07.864
4.000 people go here.

577
00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:11.035
4.000 people go to the same
school in the same place.

578
00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:12.803
4.000 people that don't owe you
anything. dude.

579
00:36:12.835 --> 00:36:15.338
You're not constantly being
stiffed by people.

580
00:36:15.371 --> 00:36:17.773
Okay. awesome. great. Got it.

581
00:36:17.873 --> 00:36:19.709
Like. I don't owe you anything.

582
00:36:19.742 --> 00:36:21.311
I don't owe you my time.

583
00:36:21.344 --> 00:36:23.079
I don't think you do.

584
00:36:23.179 --> 00:36:25.148
But I still want to hang out
with you.

585
00:36:25.181 --> 00:36:30.320
like I'm down to hang out with
you tonight.

586
00:36:30.353 --> 00:36:33.256
Yeah. I'm like. really fun to
be around.

587
00:36:35.025 --> 00:36:37.795
I'm fun to be around too.

588
00:36:37.894 --> 00:36:39.262
I'm really fun to be around.

589
00:36:39.362 --> 00:36:41.565
I don't know dude. you say you
don't have any friends.

590
00:36:41.664 --> 00:36:43.900
Yeah. because everybody fucking
sucks here.

591
00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:46.670
Oh. sorry. I forgot.
I forgot that.

592
00:36:46.702 --> 00:36:49.672
What I'm saying is like college
is and

593
00:36:49.706 --> 00:36:52.242
like it should be the most
selfish time in your life.

594
00:36:52.342 --> 00:36:53.777
Like the agenda here is not to

595
00:36:53.876 --> 00:36:55.913
learn how to be a great friend.

596
00:36:56.012 --> 00:36:57.980
Okay. what is the agenda?

597
00:36:58.215 --> 00:37:00.217
Figure out who you are?

598
00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:02.052
Actually it is.

599
00:37:02.085 --> 00:37:04.253
Whatever. look watch this
comeback.

600
00:37:04.353 --> 00:37:06.389
Yeah. I want other people to
help me in that.

601
00:37:06.422 --> 00:37:09.225
Like I want other people to be
a part of my identity.

602
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.561
I think it's about like.
figuring out who you are

603
00:37:11.594 --> 00:37:14.130
separate from other people and
like taking care of yourself.

604
00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:15.533
Yeah. I just don't like college.

605
00:37:15.565 --> 00:37:18.568
I agree with you.

606
00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:20.069
but can you agree with me that
maybe

607
00:37:20.103 --> 00:37:21.571
we can add to that agenda.

608
00:37:21.605 --> 00:37:24.875
like learning how to better
look after each other.

609
00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:29.079
Hey. you guys want to play with
the Great Bambino?

610
00:37:29.112 --> 00:37:30.013
Any interest?

611
00:37:30.246 --> 00:37:31.013
Should I tell him we're busy?

612
00:37:31.248 --> 00:37:32.282
Why. what do you mean?

613
00:37:32.382 --> 00:37:33.583
To bury Pete.

614
00:37:33.617 --> 00:37:35.819
We can do it after softball.

615
00:37:35.918 --> 00:37:37.087
Tons of interest.

616
00:37:58.275 --> 00:38:00.443
One. two. three. Wolves.

617
00:38:00.476 --> 00:38:03.045
Hey. y'all ready yet?

618
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.847
Yeah. we're ready. punks!

619
00:38:05.047 --> 00:38:07.517
Yeah. we got a new pitcher. so
it's about to be a comeback.

620
00:38:07.684 --> 00:38:08.451
You're pitching?

621
00:38:22.331 --> 00:38:24.733
- Fuck.
- Oh my God.

622
00:38:24.835 --> 00:38:27.103
Shit. oh my God.

623
00:38:27.137 --> 00:38:28.471
Are you okay?

624
00:38:28.505 --> 00:38:30.074
You suck at pitching.

625
00:38:30.273 --> 00:38:31.507
Yeah. Where did it hit?

626
00:38:31.608 --> 00:38:33.477
My calf. You are so bad at
pitching.

627
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.711
I know. I'm so sorry. Wait
guys. do we have ice?

628
00:38:35.811 --> 00:38:36.947
Yeah. Go get some.

629
00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.181
No. it's okay. No. I don't need
ice. I'm all right.

630
00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:39.550
Are you sure?

631
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.317
I'm all right. Yeah I know. he
sucks and pitching.

632
00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:41.686
It wasn't hard.

633
00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:48.525
Fuck. ow. It is not as not a
softball. It's a hardball.

634
00:38:48.625 --> 00:38:52.628
Dude. I'm so sorry.

635
00:38:52.661 --> 00:38:53.896
It's okay. It's
fine. I'm okay.

636
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:57.366
I've like. I really truly have
never been so sorry.

637
00:38:57.467 --> 00:38:59.135
Oh my God. stop apologizing.

638
00:38:59.168 --> 00:39:01.105
You keep apologizing. then
you're going to be sorry.

639
00:39:01.304 --> 00:39:02.905
Because I'm going to knock your
block off.

640
00:39:03.005 --> 00:39:05.341
Protruding. Is that the word?

641
00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:07.311
Why don't we just get you ice.

642
00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:09.380
like let's go to Burt's off
campus.

643
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.880
We can get our lunch there.

644
00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:12.482
It's such a waste of money.
It's fine. It's really fine.

645
00:39:12.581 --> 00:39:14.350
Okay. We can just walk there.
It's like super close.

646
00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:15.486
Okay. all right.

647
00:39:15.518 --> 00:39:18.755
If it gets out to here.
if it swells.

648
00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:19.990
If it get down to here?

649
00:39:20.023 --> 00:39:22.925
Yeah. like if it swells out
that far. then we'll go.

650
00:39:23.025 --> 00:39:23.960
Okay. how about here?

651
00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:24.961
Okay.

652
00:39:24.994 --> 00:39:25.895
Okay.

653
00:39:25.929 --> 00:39:26.931
Okay.

654
00:39:30.867 --> 00:39:32.702
Am I the first person

655
00:39:32.735 --> 00:39:35.105
you've had sex with at college?

656
00:39:36.639 --> 00:39:40.043
We didn't really have sex.

657
00:39:41.177 --> 00:39:47.284
Okay. am I first person you've
kissed naked at college?

658
00:39:47.384 --> 00:39:51.655
Yeah. yes.

659
00:39:51.688 --> 00:39:53.356
And you're the second person

660
00:39:53.389 --> 00:39:56.158
that I've kissed naked
in my life.

661
00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.429
I had a girlfriend in high
school.

662
00:39:58.528 --> 00:40:01.164
and we dated for like three
years.

663
00:40:02.432 --> 00:40:05.635
What happened? Did you break up
because of college?

664
00:40:05.735 --> 00:40:07.504
Yeah.

665
00:40:08.871 --> 00:40:12.007
I had a boyfriend
in high school also.

666
00:40:12.574 --> 00:40:14.878
There's just like senior year.

667
00:40:14.911 --> 00:40:18.815
Did you break up for college?
Like because the distance?

668
00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:24.155
No. we broke up because I kept
cheating on him.

669
00:40:34.797 --> 00:40:38.201
Yeah. I feel like that'll do it
for most high school relationships.

670
00:40:40.637 --> 00:40:42.606
Excuse me. I'm going to have to

671
00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:45.307
ask you guys to leave the
softball field.

672
00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:50.780
Yeah. when exactly are you going
to have to ask us to do that sir?

673
00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:52.615
Yeah. what time?

674
00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:55.286
Okay. I know it didn't get
swollen out to here.

675
00:40:55.318 --> 00:40:57.621
- but I really feel we should.
- No.

676
00:40:57.655 --> 00:41:02.859
I don't want to go. I don't want
to go. I don't want to go. Fuck.

677
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.760
Does it hurt?

678
00:41:03.793 --> 00:41:05.327
Yeah. It hurts really bad.

679
00:41:05.427 --> 00:41:07.130
Did it get tight.

680
00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:08.465
Okay.

681
00:41:08.498 --> 00:41:09.666
- All right. let's go.
- We should go.

682
00:41:09.766 --> 00:41:10.933
I generally thought I was. but
I was just like

683
00:41:11.034 --> 00:41:13.537
a fucking asshole to everybody
all the time.

684
00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:14.771
Did you do theater?

685
00:41:14.804 --> 00:41:19.075
- Yes. Wait did you do theater?
- Yeah.

686
00:41:19.108 --> 00:41:22.112
Did you ever have the stage
managers that were really

687
00:41:22.144 --> 00:41:25.449
weirdly grumpy and jaded and
actually mean.

688
00:41:25.481 --> 00:41:27.717
I actually had really great
stage managers.

689
00:41:27.817 --> 00:41:32.222
Okay. cool. Well. I was a stage
manager and I was just

690
00:41:32.322 --> 00:41:33.957
really jealous of the actors

691
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.025
because I always wanted to
audition for the play.

692
00:41:36.059 --> 00:41:36.994
but I never did.

693
00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:39.061
It really wasn't my vibe. So I
never did.

694
00:41:39.161 --> 00:41:40.362
You never auditioned?

695
00:41:40.463 --> 00:41:41.931
- No.
- Not even once?

696
00:41:42.032 --> 00:41:43.267
Not even once.

697
00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:45.969
So you just moved to L.A.

698
00:41:46.001 --> 00:41:47.903
to pursue your dream to become
a star?

699
00:41:48.003 --> 00:41:50.139
No. Oh my god. No.

700
00:41:50.172 --> 00:41:53.108
Wait. sorry. I think I'm getting
a phone call right now.

701
00:41:53.208 --> 00:41:56.646
Sorry. Yeah. this is my sister

702
00:41:56.679 --> 00:41:58.347
and I feel like I should answer
cause she was at a party.

703
00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.516
No go ahead.

704
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:06.023
Right. sorry. Hello.

705
00:42:06.489 --> 00:42:07.590
Oh. fuck!

706
00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:11.427
Jesse! Margret off the phone. he
is sick.

707
00:42:11.527 --> 00:42:12.494
- He's fine!
- You're sick?

708
00:42:12.528 --> 00:42:14.565
I'm actually better. Mom.

709
00:42:14.664 --> 00:42:16.266
Why'd you call?
Is everything okay.

710
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:19.570
Yeah. Boy. Yes.

711
00:42:21.471 --> 00:42:23.373
Are you drunk right now?

712
00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:25.307
- No.
- Yes.

713
00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:27.911
Alright. dork. well is that why you
called. to show me that you're drunk?

714
00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:31.148
- No. you all are haters.
- Yes.

715
00:42:31.181 --> 00:42:33.449
I'm not a hater. I think it's great
you drink. I just can't talk right now.

716
00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.318
I'm a hater. she's 15.

717
00:42:35.518 --> 00:42:36.720
she doesn't need to be drinking
already.

718
00:42:36.753 --> 00:42:38.121
Okay guys. it's so late there.

719
00:42:38.221 --> 00:42:39.155
you all go to sleep. I gotta go.

720
00:42:39.255 --> 00:42:42.358
Dallas doesn't sleep. boy.

721
00:42:42.391 --> 00:42:44.527
Oh my god. help me.
Are you outside.

722
00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:46.363
because you should be inside
getting rest.

723
00:42:46.396 --> 00:42:47.564
You should be inside getting
rest.

724
00:42:47.597 --> 00:42:49.533
Mom. I'm not sick.

725
00:42:49.565 --> 00:42:50.800
I'm with a friend. guys.

726
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.635
That was allergies earlier I
think.

727
00:42:52.735 --> 00:42:55.338
I'm fine. But I have to go.

728
00:42:55.572 --> 00:42:58.240
Who are you with. are you with
a girl?

729
00:42:58.273 --> 00:43:00.976
Help me. Good bye.

730
00:43:01.744 --> 00:43:05.181
I'm so sorry that you had to
see that.

731
00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:06.083
No.

732
00:43:06.115 --> 00:43:07.250
I loved it.

733
00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:08.485
They're a lot.

734
00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:10.820
It seems like you guys are
really close.

735
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.989
Yes.

736
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:22.967
Yeah. Well. we go way back.

737
00:43:25.702 --> 00:43:29.137
I feel like I learned a ton
about you from that.

738
00:43:29.172 --> 00:43:30.206
Like what?

739
00:43:30.239 --> 00:43:32.508
I don't know. You have a really
cute sister and

740
00:43:32.608 --> 00:43:36.145
your mom is. like such a mom.

741
00:43:36.179 --> 00:43:36.980
She is such a mom.

742
00:43:37.012 --> 00:43:37.847
Yeah.

743
00:43:37.947 --> 00:43:40.616
She really leans in the mom
stuff.

744
00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:43.387
She gives lots of hugs.

745
00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:48.391
What about your dad. does he
give a lot of hugs?

746
00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:56.733
He used to. but my dad passed
away. He died.

747
00:43:57.601 --> 00:43:58.968
I'm sorry.

748
00:43:59.001 --> 00:44:00.469
It's fine.

749
00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:04.007
Has that like really affected
you?

750
00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:05.307
My dad dying?

751
00:44:05.342 --> 00:44:11.047
I'm so sorry. I just mean.

752
00:44:11.146 --> 00:44:14.418
how has it really affected you
I guess?

753
00:44:16.251 --> 00:44:21.023
I don't know. This is going to
sound weird.

754
00:44:21.123 --> 00:44:25.428
but I really don't think it's
affected me that much.

755
00:44:28.597 --> 00:44:31.434
I obviously miss having him
around.

756
00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:35.672
but I don't know.

757
00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:40.443
everything was and everything
has been okay.

758
00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:46.348
I don't know. Three months
before he died.

759
00:44:46.382 --> 00:44:47.650
he wrote me and my sister

760
00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:50.454
this letter and at the end of
the letter.

761
00:44:50.487 --> 00:44:54.190
it said that our names will
forever be carved into

762
00:44:54.291 --> 00:45:01.465
his heart and that just like
really I don't know.

763
00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:04.568
Wow. he wrote that.

764
00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:08.105
Yeah. I know. right.

765
00:45:10.106 --> 00:45:12.442
Oh. fuck dude.

766
00:45:12.541 --> 00:45:14.344
- Oh shit.
- It's closed.

767
00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:17.681
Oh. my god. Wait. No. I thought it
was supposed to be open 24 hours.

768
00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:21.218
Yeah. so did I. what are we
going to do for ice?

769
00:45:22.652 --> 00:45:25.255
Do you think this thing is cold.

770
00:45:25.289 --> 00:45:26.623
Seven stories?

771
00:45:26.722 --> 00:45:27.690
Okay.

772
00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:29.492
Okay. Jeff.

773
00:45:30.592 --> 00:45:33.797
What are your parents like?

774
00:45:34.697 --> 00:45:38.568
They're fine. just like parents.

775
00:45:38.601 --> 00:45:40.737
That's super boring.

776
00:45:40.769 --> 00:45:42.505
I know. they they suck.

777
00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:44.740
I just felt like you just said
your dad is dead.

778
00:45:44.773 --> 00:45:48.277
so I didn't want to complain
about my parents?

779
00:45:51.914 --> 00:45:55.518
Why do they suck.

780
00:45:57.686 --> 00:46:00.222
My dad's. like a loser and my

781
00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:02.726
mom's. like really cold and
distant because she

782
00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:04.827
chose such a fucking asshole to

783
00:46:04.927 --> 00:46:08.164
be the father of her children.
I think.

784
00:46:09.731 --> 00:46:11.534
Are they divorced?

785
00:46:11.768 --> 00:46:14.536
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
they're divorced.

786
00:46:14.737 --> 00:46:16.539
They got divorced when I was in
first grade

787
00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:21.777
and my mom's. like dating a guy
named Bruce Now.

788
00:46:21.811 --> 00:46:23.546
Do you like Bruce?

789
00:46:23.746 --> 00:46:25.047
I don't know Bruce.

790
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:26.583
He seems fine. I don't know.
he's kind of weird.

791
00:46:26.615 --> 00:46:28.550
I just met him. like one time.
though.

792
00:46:28.784 --> 00:46:31.554
Do you have a relationship with
your dad?

793
00:46:32.655 --> 00:46:35.559
I haven't spoken to him since I
was 15.

794
00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:36.559
What?

795
00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:37.760
Yeah.

796
00:46:37.793 --> 00:46:39.596
Oh my god. what?

797
00:46:39.628 --> 00:46:40.663
Yeah.

798
00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:42.265
My sister and I told

799
00:46:42.297 --> 00:46:44.332
him we hated him and we never
want to

800
00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:49.039
talk to him again and he just
listened to that.

801
00:46:51.108 --> 00:46:56.146
He. like actually got remarried
two years ago and

802
00:46:56.179 --> 00:46:59.115
didn't invite us to the wedding

803
00:46:59.148 --> 00:47:01.218
and. like this is a really big
wedding and

804
00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.285
all my aunts and uncles

805
00:47:02.385 --> 00:47:04.588
like and grandparents and
stuff were there.

806
00:47:07.023 --> 00:47:09.791
That's super mature.

807
00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:10.994
Yeah. That's I mean.

808
00:47:11.027 --> 00:47:14.597
he's just. like a fuckin' loser.

809
00:47:16.965 --> 00:47:20.269
Does it make you more sad or
more angry?

810
00:47:20.369 --> 00:47:24.340
What?

811
00:47:24.373 --> 00:47:27.009
Like. your dad being.

812
00:47:27.643 --> 00:47:33.850
does your shitty dad make you
more sad or more angry?

813
00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:42.692
I don't know. I guess neither
honestly.

814
00:47:42.724 --> 00:47:44.260
It's just been bad with him for
so long.

815
00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.828
that I don't feel a lot about
it.

816
00:47:46.862 --> 00:47:49.565
I don't feel angry or sad or
anything.

817
00:47:49.666 --> 00:47:54.771
Sometimes I feel sad on his
behalf.

818
00:47:54.871 --> 00:47:57.907
It's so sad that he doesn't.

819
00:47:58.007 --> 00:48:00.342
I don't know. maybe this sounds
conceited.

820
00:48:00.376 --> 00:48:02.778
but my sister and I grew up to
be like

821
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.883
such cool people and he doesn't
get to know that.

822
00:48:06.916 --> 00:48:12.255
it's sad for him. It's shitty.

823
00:48:12.355 --> 00:48:14.856
- Wow. I almost killed that guy.
- Yeah.

824
00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:16.526
That would have been his fault
totally though.

825
00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:20.497
Yeah. right. He didn't have the
white pedestrian light.

826
00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:22.732
White pedestrian light?

827
00:48:22.764 --> 00:48:24.900
You mean the green pedestrian
light?

828
00:48:24.934 --> 00:48:26.870
I'm talking about the person.

829
00:48:26.902 --> 00:48:30.673
Yeah. The person's green. right?

830
00:48:32.775 --> 00:48:35.444
I think he's white.

831
00:48:35.478 --> 00:48:37.880
Jeff. I'm pretty sure.

832
00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:40.383
It's green. like the red hand.

833
00:48:40.416 --> 00:48:43.987
so that would mean the person's
green.

834
00:48:44.086 --> 00:48:46.456
You all are both colorblind.

835
00:48:46.489 --> 00:48:47.891
It's absolutely white.

836
00:48:47.923 --> 00:48:49.259
Well. I'm actually colorblind.

837
00:48:49.291 --> 00:48:50.525
but she thinks it's green too.

838
00:48:50.626 --> 00:48:52.229
I'm actually colorblind also.

839
00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:54.497
- You're what?
- You're both colorblind.

840
00:48:54.597 --> 00:48:55.699
Yeah.

841
00:48:55.731 --> 00:48:57.067
I thought girls can't be color
blind.

842
00:48:57.166 --> 00:48:59.702
Women can be colorblind it's
just 0.3% of them are so.

843
00:48:59.902 --> 00:49:01.671
We're both colorblind?

844
00:49:01.771 --> 00:49:02.938
Yeah. that's crazy.

845
00:49:02.972 --> 00:49:04.774
That Is crazy. have you guys
heard of

846
00:49:04.807 --> 00:49:08.311
those glasses like cures.

847
00:49:08.411 --> 00:49:12.282
with the videos. are they
expensive?

848
00:49:12.315 --> 00:49:12.914
Yeah.

849
00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:14.550
I don't know. I feel

850
00:49:14.583 --> 00:49:15.951
like I would never want to wear
them because then I

851
00:49:16.052 --> 00:49:19.456
have to take them off and reckon
without them.

852
00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:23.293
I want to try it at least once
and have that experience.

853
00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:24.294
- That's crazy that you're colorblind.
- Yeah.

854
00:49:24.327 --> 00:49:26.963
Are you allergic to peanuts?

855
00:49:26.996 --> 00:49:28.797
No. Wait why?

856
00:49:28.831 --> 00:49:29.999
I'm just checking.

857
00:49:30.099 --> 00:49:31.801
I'm allergic to gluten.

858
00:49:31.833 --> 00:49:33.536
Really? That's. like a bad one.

859
00:49:33.635 --> 00:49:34.938
Yeah. tell me about it.

860
00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:37.541
You're colorblind and allergic
to peanuts?

861
00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:38.976
Yes.

862
00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:42.646
I wouldn't survive a day in the
before Christ days.

863
00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:43.945
No. you would've been fine.

864
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.983
you just would have had to find
a good partner.

865
00:49:47.016 --> 00:49:50.019
Don't look at me. I'm
colorblind.

866
00:49:50.119 --> 00:49:52.688
I would have been the only
colorblind woman

867
00:49:52.788 --> 00:49:54.724
alive in Mesopotamia.

868
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.076
Maybe I really should have him
cremated.

869
00:50:14.175 --> 00:50:16.846
So you can keep in your room?

870
00:50:16.878 --> 00:50:20.849
I'm down to cremate him. if you
want.

871
00:50:20.882 --> 00:50:22.618
I'll go on another adventure.

872
00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:30.293
No. I'm just procrastinating.
Okay. Let's do this.

873
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.535
Can you help me?

874
00:50:39.568 --> 00:50:41.403
Yeah. Are you okay?

875
00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:42.939
It's just weird.
This is so weird.

876
00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:45.342
Yeah. I know it's just so weird.

877
00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:47.710
burying a dead body is the
weirdest thing ever.

878
00:50:47.742 --> 00:50:50.346
It's so fucking weird

879
00:50:50.378 --> 00:50:52.414
But we can slow down. We don't
have to do it right now.

880
00:50:52.514 --> 00:50:55.484
We can l take our time. I feel
like we are rushing.

881
00:50:58.987 --> 00:51:01.056
Here. let me do this.

882
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:05.027
What are you doing?

883
00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:07.063
I'm going to take Pete out of
the whole

884
00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:13.102
and keep him out. so he's
visible.

885
00:51:13.202 --> 00:51:14.838
It was nice seeing him

886
00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:16.972
before I realize we haven't
looked at him all night.

887
00:51:17.072 --> 00:51:19.040
He's been in the shoe box?

888
00:51:19.074 --> 00:51:21.843
Yeah and he is a beautiful
turtle.

889
00:51:22.077 --> 00:51:23.679
Thank you.

890
00:51:24.547 --> 00:51:26.849
Did you have something to do
with that?

891
00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:28.451
Yeah. I gave birth to him.

892
00:51:34.056 --> 00:51:36.125
Do you believe in God?

893
00:51:38.094 --> 00:51:42.666
On airplanes. I do.

894
00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:43.800
It's like anytime. I can't

895
00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.468
even pretend to have any
control.

896
00:51:45.501 --> 00:51:48.103
Yeah. Yes.

897
00:51:48.137 --> 00:51:50.874
Feel like. when I think about
dying.

898
00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:54.311
I'm just like. see you soon.
big guy.

899
00:52:00.449 --> 00:52:05.889
Yeah. Death sucks. I'm not okay
with it. Death is ass.

900
00:52:11.226 --> 00:52:13.596
I can't believe that

901
00:52:13.628 --> 00:52:15.798
like everything is just going
to vanish.

902
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:17.366
Yeah.

903
00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:31.181
So that's going to vanish for
me to though.

904
00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.583
you're not alone in that.

905
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.197
- Maggie?
- Yes.

906
00:52:48.297 --> 00:52:50.199
- Are you okay?
- Mmhmm.

907
00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:54.137
Yeah I'm okay.

908
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:56.172
I'm fine. I'm okay.
I'm all right.

909
00:52:56.204 --> 00:53:00.543
Let's do it.

910
00:53:00.643 --> 00:53:02.177
I'm ready to do the burial.
Let's do this.

911
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:04.212
Okay. Yes. I totally agree but
can I say.

912
00:53:04.313 --> 00:53:05.948
can I throw out an idea?

913
00:53:06.181 --> 00:53:07.282
Go ahead.

914
00:53:07.315 --> 00:53:08.083
Okay. Well. like earlier I was
going to

915
00:53:08.284 --> 00:53:09.418
suggest that you say some words

916
00:53:09.518 --> 00:53:10.320
and I was thinking at first
that it would

917
00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:11.820
be after you buried him.

918
00:53:11.853 --> 00:53:14.423
But now I'm thinking that
doesn't make any sense and you

919
00:53:14.523 --> 00:53:17.993
should just say words now.
while he is out.

920
00:53:18.027 --> 00:53:19.596
Okay.

921
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:26.970
Let's do it. Can you start and I'll
just close? I'm just going to close.

922
00:53:27.202 --> 00:53:27.938
Yeah.

923
00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:38.179
Pete. I really wish I could have
known you when you

924
00:53:38.213 --> 00:53:41.985
were able to move around and
hang out.

925
00:53:42.184 --> 00:53:45.221
I can tell Maggie really likes
you a ton.

926
00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:51.661
So I'm really bummed that we
couldn't be friends.

927
00:53:52.193 --> 00:53:55.364
But I'm really really glad that

928
00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:59.536
you were such a great friend to
Maggie for so long.

929
00:53:59.568 --> 00:54:03.404
Because she's really awesome

930
00:54:03.438 --> 00:54:06.241
and I feel like you had a lot
to do with that.

931
00:54:06.275 --> 00:54:10.012
So good job.

932
00:54:10.579 --> 00:54:13.583
You did a really good job.

933
00:54:13.615 --> 00:54:18.288
Being alive and being a friend.

934
00:54:25.394 --> 00:54:28.396
Pete. I have not

935
00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:32.302
dealt with as much tragedy and
loss as Alex has.

936
00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:38.041
so my eulogy is going to
fuckin' blow comparatively.

937
00:54:41.242 --> 00:54:43.778
Yeah. I mean. Alex was right.

938
00:54:43.878 --> 00:54:47.415
you were a really good friend
and you were

939
00:54:47.449 --> 00:54:51.887
a really great listener and I
really felt like.

940
00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:55.023
I could cut through all the
bullshit with you.

941
00:54:55.123 --> 00:54:57.493
which was really nice.

942
00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:05.668
I don't know. it's going to
suck.

943
00:55:05.768 --> 00:55:11.974
I know. it's going to suck when I-I
don't know. it's gonna suck when I-

944
00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:39.402
I feel like we're going to
start feeling. hung over.

945
00:55:39.501 --> 00:55:41.237
Should we have like a beer or
something?

946
00:55:41.336 --> 00:55:43.472
Level ourselves out?

947
00:55:44.005 --> 00:55:48.576
Yeah. Sure. I'm not like dying
for Brewski.

948
00:55:48.677 --> 00:55:50.880
But I'll have one.
if you have one.

949
00:55:56.018 --> 00:55:58.586
What about Dos Equises?

950
00:55:58.686 --> 00:56:00.822
No. yeah. all beer tastes the

951
00:56:00.856 --> 00:56:05.194
same minus the IPA stuff.
whatever.

952
00:56:05.228 --> 00:56:08.097
Dose of kisses.

953
00:56:09.164 --> 00:56:12.034
That's clever.

954
00:56:22.043 --> 00:56:27.715
What's up? Not a lot of chuckle
is coming from the audience.

955
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:32.088
You guys tired?
Y'all hungover?

956
00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:33.590
No. You're just not funny.

957
00:56:35.557 --> 00:56:41.230
Oh. you're just not attractive.
so how's that? Yeah. I know.

958
00:56:41.262 --> 00:56:43.065
I heard a couple of you say it.

959
00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:46.602
it's yeah. I'm hung over too.
I'm hung over too.

960
00:56:46.702 --> 00:56:48.604
I was actually
going to wake up and

961
00:56:48.704 --> 00:56:50.039
write some jokes for you all
today.

962
00:56:50.072 --> 00:56:54.978
but instead. I had to clean
shit off my floor.

963
00:56:56.211 --> 00:56:59.280
Shit my pants.

964
00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:04.820
Too much Schlitz that'll get
you.

965
00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.588
Oh my what is this?

966
00:57:06.621 --> 00:57:09.125
Open mic and muffins.

967
00:57:09.224 --> 00:57:13.028
wow. That's an idea.

968
00:57:24.673 --> 00:57:25.608
Hey.

969
00:57:25.641 --> 00:57:26.442
Hey.

970
00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:28.711
Can you hand me my shirt?

971
00:57:28.811 --> 00:57:29.512
Yeah.

972
00:57:33.481 --> 00:57:36.184
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

973
00:57:36.284 --> 00:57:37.820
I'll turn around.

974
00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:49.666
Hey. do you know that you talk
in your sleep?

975
00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:51.267
What?

976
00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:52.468
Are you dressed? Can I turn
around?

977
00:57:52.501 --> 00:57:59.108
- Yeah.
- You talk in your sleep.

978
00:57:59.141 --> 00:58:02.144
Last night. in the middle of
the night I woke up to a

979
00:58:02.177 --> 00:58:04.380
noise and it was you.

980
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.481
you had a blanket right
here and you were

981
00:58:06.514 --> 00:58:08.518
holding it really tight and
you're like.

982
00:58:08.617 --> 00:58:10.985
it's okay and I was like.

983
00:58:11.019 --> 00:58:12.822
Maggie are you okay?

984
00:58:12.855 --> 00:58:16.992
You're like. yeah I'm totally
fine.

985
00:58:17.092 --> 00:58:20.829
It was probably the sweetest
thing I've ever seen.

986
00:58:20.862 --> 00:58:25.268
I don't know. I was really
drunk last night. I guess.

987
00:58:25.735 --> 00:58:28.304
When we fell asleep?

988
00:58:28.336 --> 00:58:30.539
Yeah.

989
00:58:30.639 --> 00:58:32.509
I mean. yeah. I guess we
did have a ton of

990
00:58:32.541 --> 00:58:36.978
wine and I am feeling pretty
hung over. right now.

991
00:58:37.012 --> 00:58:42.652
Yeah. Sorry. I have to start my
day and stuff.

992
00:58:42.684 --> 00:58:45.487
Do you mind if I just get
past you?

993
00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:46.355
Yeah. I'm blocking you.

994
00:58:46.387 --> 00:58:48.257
Yeah.

995
00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:57.532
You're still here.

996
00:58:57.565 --> 00:59:02.303
Yeah. I put my clothes on now.

997
00:59:02.704 --> 00:59:05.740
Sorry. Can I just sip that
water?

998
00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.576
Oh your doing it. can I have it
after?

999
00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:09.612
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1000
00:59:13.815 --> 00:59:16.552
When you were gone. I remembered

1001
00:59:16.585 --> 00:59:19.020
an insane dream I had last
night.

1002
00:59:19.054 --> 00:59:24.326
You and I were floating in
space and then we

1003
00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:26.762
saw George Clooney and

1004
00:59:26.862 --> 00:59:29.298
then he asked us how Sandra
Bullock was doing.

1005
00:59:29.398 --> 00:59:34.170
That's insane. Let me make my
bed.

1006
00:59:34.269 --> 00:59:35.336
Have you seen that movie?

1007
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:37.339
No. I haven't.

1008
00:59:37.539 --> 00:59:40.509
It's called "Gravity"

1009
00:59:40.541 --> 00:59:42.778
with Sandra Bullock and George
Clooney.

1010
00:59:42.811 --> 00:59:43.645
Yeah.

1011
00:59:43.679 --> 00:59:45.547
I think it won a bunch of
Oscars

1012
00:59:45.581 --> 00:59:48.351
like 2014 or something.

1013
00:59:54.690 --> 00:59:57.326
Hey. do you want to go get

1014
00:59:57.427 --> 00:59:59.193
a breakfast burrito or
something?

1015
00:59:59.293 --> 01:00:01.129
At Tropicana? I haven't been.

1016
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:04.567
but Sam talks about it a lot
and just be a little walk?

1017
01:00:04.599 --> 01:00:05.967
Yeah. Sorry. I just like

1018
01:00:06.068 --> 01:00:08.604
that's sounds like a ton to me
right now.

1019
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:11.940
Okay. I feel like you're really
grumpy right now and

1020
01:00:11.974 --> 01:00:13.909
you want me to leave.
is that correct?

1021
01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:16.178
I'm not really grumpy. I have a
lot to do today.

1022
01:00:16.411 --> 01:00:19.447
so I'm freaking out about that.
So I want to start.

1023
01:00:19.481 --> 01:00:21.316
Yeah. I get that.
I understand that.

1024
01:00:21.416 --> 01:00:22.851
That makes sense. I just feel

1025
01:00:22.951 --> 01:00:26.755
like I'm missing something
right now.

1026
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.392
I don't know what you mean.

1027
01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:49.644
I just want to knock on her
door. I don't know.

1028
01:00:49.677 --> 01:00:51.079
Well then knock on her door.

1029
01:00:51.179 --> 01:00:52.213
Oh my God Mom. I cant.

1030
01:00:52.414 --> 01:00:53.549
That's what I'm trying to tell
you. I can't do that.

1031
01:00:53.648 --> 01:00:55.016
She doesn't want that.

1032
01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:56.619
Okay. Well. I don't know what
you want me to say here.

1033
01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:58.420
Okay. I've shared my thoughts.

1034
01:00:58.653 --> 01:01:00.088
She's your best friend.

1035
01:01:00.188 --> 01:01:02.625
You knock on her door. you say
Emily. I'm sorry I fucked up.

1036
01:01:02.657 --> 01:01:03.992
Okay. bye mum. bye Mom
bye Mom. bye Mom.

1037
01:01:04.025 --> 01:01:06.663
Wait. is Josh involved in this?

1038
01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:43.666
Can we be ready?

1039
01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:45.901
Yes. I'm so starving.

1040
01:01:46.001 --> 01:01:48.037
Hey. do you have a stopping
point soon?

1041
01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:49.838
No. not yet. Just go without
me. I'm here.

1042
01:01:49.871 --> 01:01:51.706
Maggie. when is this due?

1043
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:52.740
Oh my God. soon.

1044
01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.576
But what does soon mean?

1045
01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:55.978
Next week.

1046
01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.579
Oh. bitch. no.

1047
01:01:57.679 --> 01:01:59.481
- Of course. no.
- No.

1048
01:01:59.715 --> 01:02:01.451
Sorry. I'm just on a roll.

1049
01:02:02.751 --> 01:02:05.153
Guys. this is really important.

1050
01:02:05.253 --> 01:02:06.355
Oh my God.

1051
01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.323
Excuse me. everyone. My friend
here is on a roll.

1052
01:02:08.422 --> 01:02:09.790
Eyes forward and keep it down.

1053
01:02:09.891 --> 01:02:12.561
She's on a roll. Sir. I hate to
bother you.

1054
01:02:12.594 --> 01:02:13.896
I'm so sorry. sir.

1055
01:02:13.929 --> 01:02:16.532
Do you see my friend over here?

1056
01:02:16.565 --> 01:02:21.068
I'm so sorry to bother you. She's on
a roll and this is very distracting.

1057
01:02:21.103 --> 01:02:21.971
My knees.

1058
01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:23.304
Yeah. it's distracting her.

1059
01:02:23.505 --> 01:02:24.840
It's really loud.
because she's on a roll.

1060
01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.474
You're the worst people in the
whole world.

1061
01:02:26.574 --> 01:02:28.076
What's up. dick cheese.

1062
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:28.911
Hey.

1063
01:02:33.514 --> 01:02:35.483
Where did you sleep last night?

1064
01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:40.522
I actually slept in this girl's
room.

1065
01:02:40.722 --> 01:02:44.960
Oh. pussy boy. Great.

1066
01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:49.432
Are you about to smoke a
cigarette?

1067
01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.500
Can you not be a bitch?

1068
01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:54.303
Juul's charging. I need
something.

1069
01:02:54.402 --> 01:02:59.541
Okay. What if you and I get
high together instead?

1070
01:03:00.909 --> 01:03:03.746
You want to smoke weed with me?

1071
01:03:03.778 --> 01:03:06.782
Yeah. smoke weed.

1072
01:03:07.648 --> 01:03:10.618
Fine.

1073
01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:14.056
Shit.

1074
01:03:14.088 --> 01:03:14.956
Sorry. this is going to sound
weird.

1075
01:03:15.056 --> 01:03:17.826
but could you light it for me?

1076
01:03:17.925 --> 01:03:20.762
Yeah. I didn't know you've
never smoked weed before.

1077
01:03:20.795 --> 01:03:23.865
No I have. but in high school I
did some but

1078
01:03:23.965 --> 01:03:26.567
my girlfriend would always
light it for

1079
01:03:26.768 --> 01:03:29.237
me because I always burned my
thumb.

1080
01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:30.305
Oh. yeah.

1081
01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:32.074
Yeah. that's the gayest thing
I've heard.

1082
01:03:32.173 --> 01:03:33.742
Go for it.

1083
01:03:33.842 --> 01:03:38.246
She made me feel like such a weirdo for
asking to go get breakfast burritos.

1084
01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:42.018
I've been there.

1085
01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:43.518
When?

1086
01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:44.853
Huh?

1087
01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:47.789
You said been there. When have
you been there?

1088
01:03:47.822 --> 01:03:49.157
No. no. no. no. no.

1089
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:53.395
It's just like. "Damn. man.
I've been there.".

1090
01:03:55.398 --> 01:03:58.400
I don't. wait what?

1091
01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:07.810
I mean. I haven't actually been there. but
I was just for you. it's like. been there.

1092
01:04:08.143 --> 01:04:09.845
But you haven't actually been
there?

1093
01:04:09.878 --> 01:04:12.048
I'm here for you.

1094
01:04:18.019 --> 01:04:19.688
There another party tonight.

1095
01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:22.658
Where? Diary Velma house?

1096
01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:27.929
No. Basketball house or where
the basketball team lives.

1097
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:31.033
I don't think I'm up for
another party tonight.

1098
01:04:31.065 --> 01:04:35.836
Are you. after last night
when you shit your pants?

1099
01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:40.075
I mean. like. I just need to
hydrate.

1100
01:04:40.175 --> 01:04:44.546
take a nap and I'll probably
just jerk off.

1101
01:04:44.579 --> 01:04:45.646
smoke more. I'll be ready.

1102
01:04:45.847 --> 01:04:47.615
How do you always know about
all the parties?

1103
01:04:47.715 --> 01:04:49.884
The senior water polo guys

1104
01:04:49.918 --> 01:04:51.353
have a document called the
parties

1105
01:04:51.385 --> 01:04:53.154
schedule and they put it in our
group text.

1106
01:04:58.460 --> 01:04:58.793
Yeah.

1107
01:05:01.896 --> 01:05:03.965
But yeah. this one's saying
that you got

1108
01:05:04.065 --> 01:05:07.869
to wear a wig to the party.

1109
01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.744
This one. it says that you have
to wear a wig.

1110
01:05:15.777 --> 01:05:18.746
We have to wear wigs?

1111
01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:23.119
If I send someone a message on

1112
01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:24.753
Insta. can I see if they've
seen it?

1113
01:05:24.786 --> 01:05:27.455
Yeah. it will say "seen".

1114
01:05:27.489 --> 01:05:30.659
What?

1115
01:05:30.759 --> 01:05:31.592
Shit.

1116
01:05:31.693 --> 01:05:34.396
Let me see that? Oh. my God.

1117
01:05:34.429 --> 01:05:38.601
Dude. you sent her so many
messages?

1118
01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:39.635
Yeah.

1119
01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:40.836
What?

1120
01:05:40.869 --> 01:05:42.004
It's not like we're in middle
school.

1121
01:05:42.103 --> 01:05:44.572
we don't play games or to be
elusive?

1122
01:05:44.606 --> 01:05:46.909
Were the first eight flags not
right enough.

1123
01:05:46.942 --> 01:05:49.510
you just want to set a brighter
one?

1124
01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:52.079
That's her right there. That's
right there.

1125
01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:53.782
She's going to get a wig. She's
going to go a wig.

1126
01:05:53.815 --> 01:05:54.548
What? So?

1127
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.184
We go this way.

1128
01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.755
I'll be right here.

1129
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:02.158
Hey. what's going on?

1130
01:06:02.257 --> 01:06:04.659
Oh. we don't need any help.
Thank you.

1131
01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.794
Oh. no. we don't work here.

1132
01:06:05.827 --> 01:06:08.429
Yeah. We go to school with
you-all.

1133
01:06:08.463 --> 01:06:10.132
Oh. hey. Do you guys sell water
bottles?

1134
01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:11.333
We don't work here.

1135
01:06:11.432 --> 01:06:13.735
Yeah. I mean. I sell Juulpods
but that's all.

1136
01:06:13.969 --> 01:06:15.070
Yeah. We don't work here.

1137
01:06:15.103 --> 01:06:16.304
We go to school with you-all.
Maggie.

1138
01:06:16.338 --> 01:06:17.006
Hey.

1139
01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:18.740
You guys know each other?

1140
01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.442
No. We all go to school
together.

1141
01:06:20.474 --> 01:06:25.514
He already said that.
Okay. See you.

1142
01:06:25.547 --> 01:06:25.880
That's great.

1143
01:06:25.981 --> 01:06:27.750
Yeah.

1144
01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:31.486
Yikes. That was horrible.

1145
01:06:31.519 --> 01:06:32.320
Yeah.

1146
01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:34.123
That was so bad.

1147
01:06:34.155 --> 01:06:37.492
My heart just like dropped out
of my butt-hole just now.

1148
01:06:37.525 --> 01:06:38.893
Wait. your heart what?

1149
01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:40.062
Why is she playing games?

1150
01:06:40.161 --> 01:06:41.395
She's like playing games with
me.

1151
01:06:41.496 --> 01:06:43.231
I mean. it doesn't seem like
she's playing games.

1152
01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:46.969
It just seems more like she
doesn't want to talk to you.

1153
01:06:47.001 --> 01:06:50.905
Are you sure that was the girl?

1154
01:06:51.005 --> 01:06:53.208
Yeah. that was the girl.

1155
01:06:53.307 --> 01:06:55.844
Well. she's weird. It just
seems like she

1156
01:06:55.876 --> 01:06:58.480
didn't know that you existed.

1157
01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:04.086
I mean. you know. shit gets dark sometimes.
Do you have good vision?

1158
01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:07.623
I'm ready for a night. I'm
fucking ready.

1159
01:07:07.655 --> 01:07:09.858
I'm kinda nervous. I feel like I
want to see

1160
01:07:09.891 --> 01:07:12.359
Maggie and I'm going to act
super dumb.

1161
01:07:12.393 --> 01:07:13.361
Oh. dude.

1162
01:07:13.394 --> 01:07:15.998
You got to stop that shit. man.

1163
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:18.199
Honestly. look at me.

1164
01:07:18.233 --> 01:07:19.802
just get her out of your head.

1165
01:07:20.001 --> 01:07:21.170
Don't even think about it.

1166
01:07:21.202 --> 01:07:24.206
You don't talk to her.
That's the move.

1167
01:07:24.239 --> 01:07:27.408
You talk to other girls and
then she sees that you're

1168
01:07:27.509 --> 01:07:31.179
not the little bitch that you
always claim that you are.

1169
01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:32.848
I never claim that I was.

1170
01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.883
Yeah. you do. you do. man.
Come on.

1171
01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:36.718
Don't talk to her tonight. okay?

1172
01:07:36.818 --> 01:07:39.622
Amp up. what are you going to do?
What are you going to do tonight?

1173
01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:40.890
Not talk to Maggie.

1174
01:07:40.922 --> 01:07:43.691
Not talk to Maggie.
Not talk to Maggie.

1175
01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.561
- Not talk to Maggie.
- Not talk to Maggie.

1176
01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:47.463
- Not talk to Maggie.
- Not talk to Maggie.

1177
01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:49.064
- Not talk to Maggie.
- Not talk to Maggie.

1178
01:07:50.998 --> 01:07:53.868
- Can I come in yet?
- <i>No. you got to stay out there for a few more minutes.</i>

1179
01:07:53.902 --> 01:07:54.502
You know what. fuck you too.
bro.

1180
01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:00.943
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1181
01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:02.478
- What's up?
- My guys.

1182
01:08:02.577 --> 01:08:03.778
- Hey.
- Hey. man.

1183
01:08:03.878 --> 01:08:05.146
Where y'all goin'?

1184
01:08:05.179 --> 01:08:06.847
We're going into the party.
Basketball House.

1185
01:08:07.081 --> 01:08:09.150
It's not an open party.

1186
01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:10.786
Yeah.

1187
01:08:10.885 --> 01:08:12.219
We have wigs on. Yeah.

1188
01:08:12.253 --> 01:08:15.223
I can see that. but neither of
you have tits.

1189
01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:18.326
so you're going to have to know
someone on their team.

1190
01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:21.430
Yeah. No other house has
that rule. man.

1191
01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:23.398
I understand that. I get what
you're saying. but see.

1192
01:08:23.431 --> 01:08:25.067
Basketball House is a little
different.

1193
01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:25.967
and if you don't know anybody.

1194
01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:27.702
Oh. we know Jay.

1195
01:08:27.802 --> 01:08:29.938
You know Jay?

1196
01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:31.372
Yeah.

1197
01:08:31.472 --> 01:08:32.073
Yeah.

1198
01:08:32.106 --> 01:08:32.975
You know Jay?

1199
01:08:33.074 --> 01:08:34.475
He's in the basketball team.

1200
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:35.944
Big guy. tall.

1201
01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:37.179
Tall Jay.

1202
01:08:37.212 --> 01:08:38.647
It's all good. man. Go ahead
and go have fun.

1203
01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:41.083
It's a good night. you know
what I mean?

1204
01:08:41.115 --> 01:08:42.516
Everybody's having fun.

1205
01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:45.020
Not me. clearly.

1206
01:08:45.119 --> 01:08:48.724
Oh. wow. You need to outdo
party animals.

1207
01:08:48.823 --> 01:08:49.890
Yeah.
Yeah.

1208
01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.493
You too. I got to look out for
you. guys.

1209
01:08:51.525 --> 01:08:51.992
Yeah. Yeah.

1210
01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.628
I can't believe we got in.

1211
01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:57.466
Yeah. man. Fuck that
bouncer. Here. take this.

1212
01:08:57.498 --> 01:09:00.001
Oh. no. I'm good. I've had way
too much.

1213
01:09:00.101 --> 01:09:01.737
Okay. One to grow on.

1214
01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:02.404
Oh my God.

1215
01:09:02.503 --> 01:09:07.274
Oh my God.

1216
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:09.011
Good news. I haven't seen
Maggie.

1217
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:10.912
- What?
- I haven't seen Maggie.

1218
01:09:12.346 --> 01:09:14.382
Oh. dude. I said I have not. I
have not.

1219
01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:15.551
But you brought her up. man.

1220
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:17.853
You've got to get her out of
your head.

1221
01:09:21.122 --> 01:09:23.726
Where is your water polo team?

1222
01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.426
Fuck the water polo team.

1223
01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:27.128
Now. look at me.

1224
01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:31.165
Tonight. you and I. we're making
new friends. okay?

1225

sex with them. man.

1227
01:09:40.007 --> 01:09:41.510
Let's get outside the comfort
zone.

1228
01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:44.179
Maggie is outside of my comfort
zone though.

1229
01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:46.348
No. She's inside the comfort
zone.

1230
01:09:46.381 --> 01:09:47.750
You're talking with her snugly.

1231
01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:50.918
You were talking with her all
last night. weren't you?

1232
01:09:51.019 --> 01:09:52.154
No. we don't need that.

1233
01:09:52.186 --> 01:09:54.154
Look around you. Look at this.

1234
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.959
Look at the plethora of pussy.
Okay?

1235
01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:59.527
Who do you got?
Who are you picking?

1236
01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.197
Actually. I know that girl from
the other night.

1237
01:10:03.231 --> 01:10:05.167
I'm talking to that girl.

1238
01:10:05.199 --> 01:10:06.800
All right? Ready?

1239
01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:13.774
Break!

1240
01:10:13.875 --> 01:10:15.010
Julia.

1241
01:10:15.042 --> 01:10:17.712
Alex from the softball game.
right?

1242
01:10:17.746 --> 01:10:18.747
Yeah.

1243
01:10:18.846 --> 01:10:21.615
Hi. I'm being antisocial here.
but my friends.

1244
01:10:21.716 --> 01:10:23.018
Carolina and Garrett from
softball.

1245
01:10:23.051 --> 01:10:24.419
actually. they're not here yet.

1246
01:10:24.452 --> 01:10:26.889
so I just don't know what to do
with myself.

1247
01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:29.891
I don't know what to do with
myself. I don't know.

1248
01:10:29.923 --> 01:10:31.460
- That's ideal.
- Yes. Yeah.

1249
01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:33.060
How's Maggie's leg?

1250
01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:35.230
Oh. it's good.

1251
01:10:35.262 --> 01:10:36.430
I think it's okay.

1252
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:39.067
I don't know.
That was a while ago.

1253
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.070
Yeah. you hit her super hard.

1254
01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:43.137
but it was like she
barely felt it.

1255
01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:46.240
I know. she's super tough.

1256
01:10:46.274 --> 01:10:49.110
I mean ya'll are so cute
together.

1257
01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:52.480
Oh. no. we're not together.

1258
01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:56.118
We're not. We're just friends.
We're not friends.

1259
01:10:56.217 --> 01:10:58.386
So who are you with tonight?

1260
01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:03.692
I'm hoping you. Caroline. and
Garrett.

1261
01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:06.227
Yeah.

1262
01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:07.596
- Really?
- Yeah.

1263
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:10.163
No.

1264
01:12:44.492 --> 01:12:46.195
Hey. get a room you two.

1265
01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:47.930
Hey. what the fuck man?

1266
01:12:48.029 --> 01:12:50.764
Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.

1267
01:12:50.864 --> 01:12:56.103
I thought I thought
you two were my friends.

1268
01:12:56.204 --> 01:12:58.439
and I was going to
try to be funny.

1269
01:12:58.539 --> 01:13:01.141
I don't think your two friends
will find that funny at all.

1270
01:13:01.509 --> 01:13:03.145
Yeah. That wasn't funny.

1271
01:13:03.377 --> 01:13:05.146
Yeah. That wasn't funny at all.

1272
01:13:05.346 --> 01:13:06.747
I'm sorry. That's my bad.

1273
01:13:06.847 --> 01:13:09.184
It's cool. Who do you know from
the basketball team?

1274
01:13:09.216 --> 01:13:11.152
- What's that?
- I said who do you know from the team here?

1275
01:13:11.319 --> 01:13:18.160
Oh. I know Jay. Yeah.

1276
01:13:19.694 --> 01:13:22.963
Yeah. I'm Jay.

1277
01:13:23.163 --> 01:13:28.103
Yeah. You're literally talking
to Jay right now. dumb ass.

1278
01:13:29.904 --> 01:13:36.044
What? I haven't seen you in so
long.

1279
01:13:36.077 --> 01:13:37.412
Matt. get Charlie.

1280
01:13:37.445 --> 01:13:39.413
Jay. it's me. Alex.

1281
01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:40.715
Oh. you're the guy who's
leaving.

1282
01:13:40.747 --> 01:13:43.184
That was a good one.

1283
01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:45.386
- I'm going to give you that one.
- Let go.

1284
01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.855
Let go. dude.

1285
01:13:48.221 --> 01:13:51.960
Fucking freshman bouncer bitch.

1286
01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:55.130
All right. man. Walk safe. man.
Get back to your dorm.

1287
01:13:55.229 --> 01:13:56.397
All right. walk safe. man.

1288
01:13:56.430 --> 01:14:00.167
Go back to your dorm.
That was you.

1289
01:14:00.268 --> 01:14:01.502
How much playing time are you

1290
01:14:01.601 --> 01:14:05.206
getting on the basketball team?

1291
01:14:05.673 --> 01:14:08.277
I feel like it's not a time
because Coach probably

1292
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:12.347
thinks you're too small.

1293
01:14:12.447 --> 01:14:14.248
Hey. have a good night. Have a
good night. bro.

1294
01:14:14.282 --> 01:14:16.885
You know who you remind me of?
You remind me of one of those kids in

1295
01:14:17.018 --> 01:14:18.619
high school whose parents would
always tell

1296
01:14:18.653 --> 01:14:20.722
the Coach to play them more.

1297
01:14:20.822 --> 01:14:21.456
Good one.

1298
01:14:21.488 --> 01:14:22.690
That was you. huh?

1299
01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:24.125
You're killing it. tonight.

1300
01:14:24.158 --> 01:14:25.460
This is my impression of you.

1301
01:14:25.493 --> 01:14:27.863
I'm gonna do
an impression of you.

1302
01:14:27.962 --> 01:14:31.599
Hey.
Coach. can I come into the game?

1303
01:14:31.631 --> 01:14:34.301
I'll make sure the bench is
warm for Jay.

1304
01:14:34.335 --> 01:14:36.270
What's that. Jay?

1305
01:14:36.304 --> 01:14:37.239
You want me to
make sure that no one

1306
01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:38.907
comes inside your party?

1307
01:14:43.778 --> 01:14:45.447
That was good.

1308
01:14:45.479 --> 01:14:47.515
Yeah.

1309
01:14:48.615 --> 01:14:52.153
Do you want to again in ten it?

1310
01:14:52.619 --> 01:14:55.323
Do I want to again in ten it?

1311
01:14:55.356 --> 01:14:59.261
Yeah. like have sex again in
ten minutes.

1312
01:15:23.385 --> 01:15:25.520
Hey.

1313
01:15:25.552 --> 01:15:27.322
Oh. shit. what up?

1314
01:15:27.355 --> 01:15:29.256

1315
01:15:29.356 --> 01:15:31.658
Dang. bro is this your room?

1316
01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:33.094

Yeah. this is my room. Yeah.

1318
01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:40.101
For sure bro. For sure.

1319
01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.238
Oh. fuck.

1320
01:15:43.337 --> 01:15:44.371
Are you guys like dating?

1321
01:15:44.404 --> 01:15:45.873
- No.
- No. we're no.

1322
01:15:46.274 --> 01:15:48.041
We're just like friends and I want
to talk to my friend in my room.

1323
01:15:48.143 --> 01:15:50.045
So if you could just get out.
Get the fuck out.

1324
01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:54.916
For sure bro. For sure man.
Jeez man.

1325
01:15:54.948 --> 01:15:56.283
Get out.

1326
01:15:56.384 --> 01:15:57.819
All right dude. jeez.

1327
01:16:04.225 --> 01:16:05.427
What the fuck are you doing?

1328
01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:06.761
What the fuck are doing?

1329
01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:08.563
You've just fucked
this dude in here?

1330
01:16:08.595 --> 01:16:09.764
That's none of your business.

1331
01:16:09.797 --> 01:16:11.565
I'm going to leave and if you
follow me.

1332
01:16:11.599 --> 01:16:13.935
I'm going to kick your ass.
I'm serious.

1333
01:16:13.967 --> 01:16:15.302
What?

1334
01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:16.538
Don't follow me.

1335
01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:17.972
Maggie. what's
going on right now?

1336
01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:19.106
Nothing is going on.

1337
01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:21.409
I thought you and I were having
a thing outside.

1338
01:16:21.442 --> 01:16:24.145
I was like crushing college in
there.

1339
01:16:24.345 --> 01:16:27.181
Oh my god. Okay. Yes. you seem
like you were having fun.

1340
01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.282
What do you want to say. dude?

1341
01:16:28.382 --> 01:16:29.650
Like congrats on crushing
college?

1342
01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.586
No. I was just like
doing that for you.

1343
01:16:31.618 --> 01:16:33.755
- What?
- Like I was putting on a show for you.

1344
01:16:33.854 --> 01:16:35.222
I was like trying to get your
attention.

1345
01:16:35.256 --> 01:16:37.192
Don't do that. I don't want you
to do that.

1346
01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:38.760
That doesn't make any sense.

1347
01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:42.262
You got me a drink and you told
to keep ramping up.

1348
01:16:42.296 --> 01:16:43.497
You were flirting with me.

1349
01:16:43.597 --> 01:16:45.099
We were making eye contact.

1350
01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:47.201
We were having a peak moment
and you just fucking

1351
01:16:47.301 --> 01:16:48.636
disappeared to like fuck a dude.

1352
01:16:48.735 --> 01:16:50.137
Okay. You we're having a peak
moment.

1353
01:16:50.238 --> 01:16:52.106
I was just at a fucking party
and I brought

1354
01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:54.809
you a drink and then I went
back to what I was doing.

1355
01:16:54.908 --> 01:16:58.179
Why do you want to just go back
to what you were doing?

1356
01:16:58.279 --> 01:16:59.648
What do you mean?

1357
01:16:59.747 --> 01:17:02.015
Why are you acting like last
night didn't fucking happen?

1358
01:17:02.115 --> 01:17:04.118
Why were you so mean to me
today at the store?

1359
01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:06.253
Why did you introduce me to
your fucking friends?

1360
01:17:06.287 --> 01:17:08.689
Why did save like 9.000 fucking
Instagram messages?

1361
01:17:08.789 --> 01:17:10.658
Why are you acting like a
creepy fucking psycho?

1362
01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.594
Because I like you.

1363
01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:13.995
I like you a lot.

1364
01:17:14.095 --> 01:17:16.398
I had a really good
night with you.

1365
01:17:16.631 --> 01:17:19.534
And I want to continue
to talk to you.

1366
01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:21.101
Like did you not have a good
night last night?

1367
01:17:21.135 --> 01:17:22.403
I did. I had a great
night last night.

1368
01:17:22.603 --> 01:17:24.640
Now. I'm trying to have another
great night.

1369
01:17:24.939 --> 01:17:26.608
What?

1370
01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.277
- What?
- Oh my god. dude. You're so mean.

1371
01:17:29.476 --> 01:17:31.645
You're so mean. You're awful.

1372
01:17:31.679 --> 01:17:33.547
- I'm awful?
- Yes.

1373
01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:34.614
What? Oh. my god. Did you think
we were going to

1374
01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:37.352
date because of one night?

1375
01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:38.418
No.

1376
01:17:38.618 --> 01:17:40.054
I don't want to wake up and get

1377
01:17:40.154 --> 01:17:42.423
breakfast burritos with you
dude. I don't want that.

1378
01:17:42.623 --> 01:17:44.425
Yeah. You've made that
abundantly clear.

1379
01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:48.429
But I care about you
after last night.

1380
01:17:48.628 --> 01:17:50.498
I care about you after last
night and you

1381
01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:52.167
can't just pretend
like I don't exist.

1382
01:17:52.266 --> 01:17:53.833
Actually. I can do anything
that I want.

1383
01:17:53.868 --> 01:17:55.103
I don't owe you anything.

1384
01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:56.338
I don't owe you a text.

1385
01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:57.639
about like. oh. hey. I had a
great night last night.

1386
01:17:57.671 --> 01:17:59.106
- Maggie stop.
- What?

1387
01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:00.141
- Stop.
- What?

1388
01:18:00.341 --> 01:18:01.609
Just like talk to me.
please. Just like talk to me.

1389
01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:02.743
I'm talking to you.

1390
01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:04.045
But it feels like you're not.
Just come

1391
01:18:04.078 --> 01:18:06.014
outside of yourself for two
fucking seconds.

1392
01:18:06.046 --> 01:18:08.282
Care about somebody other than
yourself for two seconds.

1393
01:18:08.382 --> 01:18:09.451
You need to grow up.

1394
01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:10.451
Why is that so fucking hard for
you?

1395
01:18:10.650 --> 01:18:11.786
You need to grow the fuck up.

1396
01:18:11.886 --> 01:18:12.553
No. you need to grow up. You
need to grow.

1397
01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:14.021
I am. I've been.

1398
01:18:14.055 --> 01:18:17.192
Your like the girl from 13
going on 30.

1399
01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:21.195
Jennifer Garner?

1400
01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:22.998
No. I'm talking about the movie
13 going on 30.

1401
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:24.698
There's like the girl would
like the little house.

1402
01:18:24.731 --> 01:18:26.033
Yeah. That's Jennifer Garner.

1403
01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:28.269
You're talking about Jennifer
Garner right now?

1404
01:18:28.368 --> 01:18:29.837
She was awesome in that movie.

1405
01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.206
What are you talking about?

1406
01:18:31.305 --> 01:18:32.806
Okay. I'm just trying to stay
like the premise of

1407
01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:34.142
that movie is that there's this
13-year-old girl.

1408
01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:35.143
Friends.

1409
01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:37.212
Hi. this is my room. man. Can
you leave?

1410
01:18:37.244 --> 01:18:39.713
Oh my gosh. Oh. my gosh.

1411
01:18:39.747 --> 01:18:41.214
I'm so sorry.

1412
01:18:41.248 --> 01:18:43.484
I'm gonna take off.

1413
01:18:48.722 --> 01:18:49.689
What?

1414
01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:51.726
I see what you're doing.

1415
01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.061
What's going on?

1416
01:18:53.094 --> 01:18:57.498
You're fucking crazy.
This is my room.

1417
01:19:01.601 --> 01:19:04.738
I'm high but I'm not
that high.

1418
01:19:04.771 --> 01:19:07.140
What are you talking about?
I wanna laugh.

1419
01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.876
I was saying you

1420
01:19:08.908 --> 01:19:10.744
are like the girl Jenny whoever
was playing.

1421
01:19:10.778 --> 01:19:11.880
It's Jennifer Garner.

1422
01:19:11.912 --> 01:19:13.413
- Okay.
- Jennifer Garner. is her name.

1423
01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.815
Okay. The girl that made a wish
that

1424
01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:16.016
she could be older and then

1425
01:19:16.117 --> 01:19:17.318
she woke up with a body of a 30
year old.

1426
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:18.452
But you she didn't know how to
be an adult

1427
01:19:18.485 --> 01:19:19.753
because she was actually 13.

1428
01:19:19.787 --> 01:19:21.389
I know the plot. Maggie. I'm
aware of the plot.

1429
01:19:21.421 --> 01:19:24.125
I'm trying to say. you are not
actually 13.

1430
01:19:24.225 --> 01:19:25.626
You don't get to just
turn back into

1431
01:19:25.725 --> 01:19:26.795
a teenager when you need a hug

1432
01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:28.496
from your mom to get through
the day.

1433
01:19:28.595 --> 01:19:29.996
You have to just be an adult.

1434
01:19:30.097 --> 01:19:31.431
There's nothing wrong with
getting

1435
01:19:31.465 --> 01:19:33.434
hugs to get you through the day.

1436
01:19:33.466 --> 01:19:35.569
I feel like you're going to cry.

1437
01:19:35.603 --> 01:19:36.671
Are you're going to cry right
now we at the backyard of

1438
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:38.105
a fucking college wig party?

1439
01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.508
There's nothing wrong with that
If I was going to.

1440
01:19:40.608 --> 01:19:41.641
There's something wrong with
that.

1441
01:19:41.676 --> 01:19:43.044
It means that you
need to grow up.

1442
01:19:43.077 --> 01:19:44.244
No. you know what it means? It
means my parents were

1443
01:19:44.345 --> 01:19:45.680
good parents who gave me love
and attention.

1444
01:19:45.779 --> 01:19:47.181
Unlike you're miserable.
horrible parents

1445
01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:48.983
who fucked you up so bad you
have to

1446
01:19:49.082 --> 01:19:50.951
have sex with random guys to
make you feel

1447
01:19:50.984 --> 01:19:53.487
good and wanted and in control.

1448
01:19:53.587 --> 01:19:58.092
Okay. Have fun with

1449
01:19:58.126 --> 01:19:59.527
your stuffed animals tonight
your parents

1450
01:19:59.627 --> 01:20:00.928
did a kick-ass job dude.

1451
01:20:00.961 --> 01:20:02.762
You know what I like my life.

1452
01:20:02.796 --> 01:20:04.097
and I liked it before last
night.

1453
01:20:04.198 --> 01:20:05.833
Just because you feel like
fucking shit about yours.

1454
01:20:05.932 --> 01:20:06.934
doesn't mean that you've get to
make me feel

1455
01:20:06.967 --> 01:20:08.635
bad about who I am. okay?

1456
01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.905
Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

1457
01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:29.502
Hey. did you or did you

1458
01:23:29.603 --> 01:23:32.106
go outside of your comfort zone
last night?

1459
01:23:33.974 --> 01:23:40.381
Oh. I don't know
if I remember it.

1460
01:23:40.481 --> 01:23:45.086
Wait. Well. I'm trying to get
back at my brain.

1461
01:23:45.185 --> 01:23:49.090
Did we walk home last night?

1462
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:52.625
No. No. we didn't.

1463
01:23:52.725 --> 01:23:54.027
But I came back in and you were

1464
01:23:54.127 --> 01:23:56.797
asleep and then I went over and
I put you on your side.

1465
01:23:56.997 --> 01:23:59.000
I remember you were like.

1466
01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:00.802
"I'm not cuddling bitch ass."

1467
01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:02.270
I was like. "No one said you
were."

1468
01:24:02.369 --> 01:24:03.871
Yeah. I don't remember that.

1469
01:24:03.904 --> 01:24:07.875
I don't. I don't remember
anything.

1470
01:24:07.908 --> 01:24:10.911
Jesus Christ. that's so scary.

1471
01:24:11.412 --> 01:24:15.216
I honestly kinda feel a
little bit responsible.

1472
01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:15.983
Why?

1473
01:24:16.015 --> 01:24:17.217
I just didn't say anything after

1474
01:24:17.251 --> 01:24:19.587
you probably took 12 shots.

1475
01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:20.855
12? 12 shots?

1476
01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:21.956
Yeah. I remember you kept
taking.

1477
01:24:22.055 --> 01:24:23.390
you take one shot
and then you take

1478
01:24:23.423 --> 01:24:25.292
another and be like.
"I want to grow on."

1479
01:24:25.391 --> 01:24:28.829
Oh. yeah. Like an extra
birthday candle.

1480
01:24:28.863 --> 01:24:31.966
Yeah. Except it ended up being
like six to grow on.

1481
01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:33.766
God. damn it. I've got to stop
drinking so much.

1482
01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:37.038
What day is it?

1483
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:38.738
What day? It's Sunday.

1484
01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:45.078
Sunday. God. Well. TGI Sunday

1485
01:24:45.113 --> 01:24:52.353
because this motherfucker is an
alcoholic. Okay.

1486
01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:57.057
Yeah. I'm down for a chill
Sunday.

1487
01:24:57.091 --> 01:24:59.127
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1488
01:24:59.426 --> 01:25:02.395
Do you want to maybe clean up
the room a little bit too?

1489
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:06.900
Yeah. This place is a
fucking mess.

1490
01:25:06.934 --> 01:25:07.868
Yeah.

1491
01:25:08.101 --> 01:25:09.203
- Let's get to it.
- Let's do it.

1492
01:25:09.436 --> 01:25:10.604
Yeah.

1493
01:25:10.637 --> 01:25:12.806
You're going to throw up?
You're going to throw up?

1494
01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:16.077
I got you. I got you.

1495
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:17.443
Here we go.
Here we go.

1496
01:25:26.686 --> 01:25:28.256
I don't think I'm going to be
able to

1497
01:25:28.288 --> 01:25:29.322
help you clean up. man.

1498
01:25:29.355 --> 01:25:30.224
- Absolutely.
- No.

1499
01:25:30.323 --> 01:25:31.891
- You stay in bed.
- Yeah.

1500
01:25:32.024 --> 01:25:33.795
I'm going to get you some water.

1501
01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:35.663
That would be great.

1502
01:25:35.762 --> 01:25:37.064
I'll get you some and I'll put
some in a red soda cups.

1503
01:25:37.096 --> 01:25:38.832
All right. that will be fire.
Yeah.

1504
01:25:43.136 --> 01:25:44.671
- Thank you.
- Yup.

1505
01:26:11.097 --> 01:26:12.934
Get off.

1506
01:26:17.904 --> 01:26:19.139
Clearly.

1507
01:26:22.475 --> 01:26:24.612
Maybe we could give
it to a new turtle.

1508
01:26:27.213 --> 01:26:28.283
Look at you.

1509
01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:12.493
I'm drowning.

1510
01:27:14.194 --> 01:27:16.296
Okay. I'm hungry.

1511
01:27:16.395 --> 01:27:17.297
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

1512
01:27:17.331 --> 01:27:19.000
Oh. my God.

1513
01:27:59.105 --> 01:28:00.206
Alex. dude.

1514
01:28:00.239 --> 01:28:01.274
- Garrett.
- We lost you last night.

1515
01:28:01.408 --> 01:28:02.677
Yeah. I know. but

1516
01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:05.244
the craziest thing happened.
It was. yeah.

1517
01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:06.680
Are you eating here?

1518
01:28:06.779 --> 01:28:09.048
No. Well. I mean.

1519
01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:11.452
I wasn't planning
on eating here.

1520
01:28:11.484 --> 01:28:12.786
I was planning to get it to go.

1521
01:28:12.819 --> 01:28:14.287
but I have time to eat

1522
01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:16.056
here if you want to eat
together. I have time.

1523
01:28:16.289 --> 01:28:17.358
If that's what you're asking.
I'm not

1524
01:28:17.457 --> 01:28:18.625
sure if that's what you're
insinuating.

1525
01:28:18.659 --> 01:28:19.492
Alex. my dude.

1526
01:28:19.592 --> 01:28:21.061
- Yeah.
- Sorry. I'll have the mushroom.

1527
01:28:21.328 --> 01:28:22.429
I'm already making it.
You were

1528
01:28:22.462 --> 01:28:23.831
sitting there talking for an
hour.

1529
01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:26.667
For here or to go?

1530
01:28:27.001 --> 01:28:31.072
For here. Thank you.

1531
01:28:32.171 --> 01:28:33.673
Definitely pretty.

1532
01:28:33.774 --> 01:28:35.242
- No way.
- Definitely pretty.

1533
01:28:35.275 --> 01:28:36.077
Absolutely not.

1534
01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:37.144
Hey.

1535
01:28:37.377 --> 01:28:38.478
Hey. It's the guy who ditched
us.

1536
01:28:38.511 --> 01:28:40.313
Yeah. What happened?
Where were you?

1537
01:28:40.346 --> 01:28:41.481
Okay. What the hell is going

1538
01:28:41.515 --> 01:28:42.816
on? I don't understand why-

1539
01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.986
I'm not friends with anybody
named Josh or Emily.

1540
01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:46.052
Wait. what?

1541
01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:47.455
Emily and Josh have never
existed.

1542
01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:50.291
I've never been friends with
anybody named Josh or Emily.

1543
01:28:50.323 --> 01:28:51.557
Every time I've brought them up.

1544
01:28:51.658 --> 01:28:53.227
I've just been talking a lie-

1545
01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:55.096
I'm going to fucking combust here.
I'm getting you on a plane.

1546
01:28:55.796 --> 01:28:56.729
No. mom. Mom.

1547
01:28:56.829 --> 01:28:59.667
Yeah. We're going to use Uncle
Tibs miles.

1548
01:28:59.699 --> 01:29:00.835
No. mom.

1549
01:29:00.935 --> 01:29:02.002
Listen. I didn't say that to
make you.

1550
01:29:02.101 --> 01:29:03.203
Why would you want us before?

1551
01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:04.538
Because you were going to tell
me to come

1552
01:29:04.572 --> 01:29:05.639
home and I probably would have
just come home.

1553
01:29:05.671 --> 01:29:06.907
There's nothing wrong with that.

1554
01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:08.574
Yes. there would have been
something wrong with that.

1555
01:29:08.675 --> 01:29:10.144
Why? Why can't you? Why? Why?

1556
01:29:10.176 --> 01:29:11.344
Mom. I can't just come home.

1557
01:29:11.377 --> 01:29:13.648
Yes you can. You actually can.
It's fine.

1558
01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.515
But I don't want to do that.

1559
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:17.016
I want to stay here.

1560
01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:19.486
I don't want to come home.

1561
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.188
At least I want to try to

1562
01:29:21.221 --> 01:29:23.123
stay here.
I haven't been trying.

1563
01:29:24.358 --> 01:29:27.128
That group of friends that I
met on Friday.

1564
01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:28.996
they invited me to sit the
marketplace with

1565
01:29:29.029 --> 01:29:31.598
them and I realized as I sat
down with them.

1566
01:29:31.698 --> 01:29:33.534
that I probably sat down at the
marketplace

1567
01:29:33.567 --> 01:29:35.703
a total of 20 times since I've
been here.

1568
01:29:35.735 --> 01:29:37.704
This whole time I've been at
the marketplace.

1569
01:29:37.738 --> 01:29:39.373
I have sat down at the
marketplace 20 times

1570
01:29:39.405 --> 01:29:41.207
because I usually just do this
thing where

1571
01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:43.211
I take a to go container and
just

1572
01:29:43.243 --> 01:29:45.679
go back to my dorm room and eat
by myself.

1573
01:29:45.712 --> 01:29:51.885
What I've realized is that I
haven't fully been here.

1574
01:29:52.685 --> 01:29:56.456
Like. I have.
but I've also been-

1575
01:29:56.556 --> 01:29:57.791
Kind of still been here too?

1576
01:29:57.824 --> 01:30:03.229
Yeah. That's why I was going to
call you guys

1577
01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:04.698
because I just wanted to say
that

1578
01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:10.170
that I love you
guys so much.

1579
01:30:12.606 --> 01:30:16.176
I love you so much and I miss
you guys so much.

1580
01:30:16.409 --> 01:30:18.912
I miss you guys so much.

1581
01:30:21.114 --> 01:30:23.483
And I think I've

1582
01:30:23.583 --> 01:30:25.819
been feeling paralyzed here
because of

1583
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.190
that and also because

1584
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:32.192
nobody here is half as

1585
01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:35.962
cool and half as loving as you
guys are.

1586
01:30:36.063 --> 01:30:40.000
But even though I'm feeling
really sad right this second.

1587
01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:41.468
an hour ago I was feeling really

1588
01:30:41.568 --> 01:30:43.270
really good and I was feeling
really

1589
01:30:43.302 --> 01:30:46.305
optimistic because I really

1590
01:30:46.405 --> 01:30:48.609
think if I start trying to throw

1591
01:30:48.641 --> 01:30:54.215
myself in to college and start
trying to fully dive in.

1592
01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:59.153
I think I can start having a
better time and

1593
01:30:59.252 --> 01:31:01.654
maybe I can meet people who are
half as

1594
01:31:01.755 --> 01:31:05.960
cool and half as loving as you
guys are.

1595
01:31:06.592 --> 01:31:08.895
Well. maybe that does mean that

1596
01:31:17.904 --> 01:31:20.107
I was going to say that maybe
that doesn't

1597
01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:23.577
mean that I shouldn't call as
much anymore.

1598
01:31:27.247 --> 01:31:34.354
Yeah. honey. I think that's
really smart. honey.

1599
01:31:34.454 --> 01:31:41.662
I mean. it's not healthy to
check in so often.

1600
01:31:42.195 --> 01:31:44.931
Yeah.

1601
01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:47.534
Yeah.

1602
01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:51.505
Yeah. We'll be here.

1603
01:31:51.537 --> 01:31:53.740
we'll always be here. honey.

1604
01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:57.011
We'll always be here whenever
you call or pick up.

1605
01:31:57.110 --> 01:32:02.315
but you should save all your
energy for all your friends

1606
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:04.785
and the parties and

1607
01:32:04.885 --> 01:32:05.920
studying and

1608
01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:08.222
all the adventures you're going
to have there.

1609
01:32:17.497 --> 01:32:19.232
I'm really sorry. honey.

1610
01:32:19.332 --> 01:32:21.534
It's okay. It's okay.

1611
01:32:21.568 --> 01:32:25.972
It's okay. I'm really sorry too.

1612
01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:56.804
You can help me.

1613
01:33:00.707 --> 01:33:04.078
Could you give me these rocks?

1614
01:33:04.444 --> 01:33:06.380
No.

1615
01:33:06.412 --> 01:33:08.414
Can I? They are really pretty.

1616
01:33:08.448 --> 01:33:09.350
Sure.

1617
01:34:38.805 --> 01:34:40.239
Good.

1618
01:34:40.439 --> 01:34:43.576
We have to make sure you go to
the shower to wash that.

1619
01:34:43.676 --> 01:34:45.679
Yeah. can somebody
do my make-up for it?

1620
01:34:45.712 --> 01:34:46.746
Okay. Give me one second.

1621
01:34:46.846 --> 01:34:49.250
Yeah. Can you give me a tiger
stripe?

1622
01:34:49.449 --> 01:34:51.417
If we give you a tiger stripe
it's going to fade.

1623
01:34:51.518 --> 01:34:55.789
Yeah.

1624
01:35:15.975 --> 01:35:18.478
What? Stop. You said the same
thing last year.

1625
01:35:18.712 --> 01:35:19.746
You liked it more that I did
last year?

1626
01:35:19.845 --> 01:35:22.081
- Yeah. I know.
- He did. She's amazing.

1627
01:35:22.548 --> 01:35:23.484
We're agreeing with you.

1628
01:35:23.716 --> 01:35:24.451
Agreed.

1629
01:35:24.484 --> 01:35:25.686
She's really good.

1630
01:35:25.719 --> 01:35:29.322
She's like. "Do you know Meryl
Streep?"

1631
01:35:29.355 --> 01:35:34.161
Just what it was like to have
been very young.

1632
01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:39.867
Particularly the days when

1633
01:35:39.899 --> 01:35:42.068
you were in love for the first
time.

1634
01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:47.373
when you felt like a person
sleepwalking and you

1635
01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:50.277
didn't quite see the street
that you were in and

1636
01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:54.481
you didn't quite hear
everything that was said to you.

1637
01:35:54.814 --> 01:35:57.617
You're just a little bit crazy.

1638
01:35:57.717 --> 01:36:01.654
So will you remember that.
please?

1639
01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:03.155
Can you guys' take my sister?
Is that okay?

1640
01:36:03.256 --> 01:36:04.924
- Yes.
- No. Just skip the test.

1641
01:36:05.024 --> 01:36:06.393
It is going to be fine.

1642
01:36:06.426 --> 01:36:08.395
No. I know. It's just my last
one. so I want to do.

1643
01:36:08.494 --> 01:36:10.497
Well. you have a full face make up on
in this outfit. What are you wearing?

1644
01:36:10.630 --> 01:36:11.797
I can take my
make-up off and change.

1645
01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:12.900
Are you about to go to the
library?

1646
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.368
- Yeah.
- To study for your finals?

1647
01:36:14.635 --> 01:36:15.534
- Yeah.
- So am I.

1648
01:36:16.002 --> 01:36:17.371
Do you wanna work together?

1649
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:18.570
Yeah.

1650
01:36:18.604 --> 01:36:19.872
- Cool.
- That's interesting.

1651
01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:21.008
Let's go.

1652
01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:23.978
What's going on? Why are you
talking?

1653
01:36:24.078 --> 01:36:25.245
Well. you're only going to

1654
01:36:25.278 --> 01:36:26.212
library because she's
going to library.

1655
01:36:26.313 --> 01:36:26.814
That's not true.

1656
01:36:26.913 --> 01:36:27.715
I think it is true.

1657
01:36:27.814 --> 01:36:29.248
I was going to the library

1658
01:36:29.282 --> 01:36:31.051
to study because I have a final
tomorrow.

1659
01:36:31.150 --> 01:36:32.152
Which final?

1660
01:36:32.185 --> 01:36:33.387
History.

1661
01:36:33.487 --> 01:36:35.055
- History?
- Of?

1662
01:36:35.421 --> 01:36:36.689
What?

1663
01:36:36.789 --> 01:36:38.458
History of?

1664
01:36:38.492 --> 01:36:40.961
The 18th century paint.

1665
01:36:40.993 --> 01:36:45.465
Paint?
What did you just say?

1666
01:36:46.466 --> 01:36:50.170
How are you so talented?

1667
01:36:50.871 --> 01:36:52.672
What did you really think of
the show?

1668
01:36:52.771 --> 01:36:54.807
I really loved it so much and I

1669
01:36:54.841 --> 01:36:57.778
really think you're the best
actor of all time.

1670
01:36:57.810 --> 01:36:59.179
- Okay.
- I'm not kidding.

1671
01:36:59.479 --> 01:37:01.581
Thank you.

1672
01:37:02.448 --> 01:37:05.786
Are you going to be in L.A.
this summer.

1673
01:37:05.819 --> 01:37:08.255
I've got a ton of studying.

1674
01:37:08.354 --> 01:37:10.356
Fuck you.

1675
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:12.693
I haven't decided yet.

1676
01:37:12.792 --> 01:37:14.661
School year ends in a week.

1677
01:37:14.694 --> 01:37:17.029
Yeah. I know. I can

1678
01:37:17.130 --> 01:37:20.201
sleep on Garret's
couch when I go to Chicago.

1679
01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.869
No. You got to decide.

1680
01:37:23.970 --> 01:37:26.573
Get out of here.

1681
01:37:32.712 --> 01:37:35.850
Alex. if I said I wanted to

1682
01:37:35.882 --> 01:37:39.519
date you and be your
girlfriend. would you stay here?

1683
01:37:45.358 --> 01:37:46.560
Yeah.

1684
01:37:48.161 --> 01:37:50.597
Really?

1685
01:37:51.564 --> 01:37:54.166
Yeah. Maggie.

1686
01:37:54.199 --> 01:37:56.869
I want to be your girlfriend.

1687
01:37:56.903 --> 01:37:59.606
You really want that?

1688
01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:02.108
I really want that.

1689
01:38:02.208 --> 01:38:06.880
You're trying to date me?

1690
01:38:06.912 --> 01:38:09.115
I'm not trying to marry you.

1691
01:38:15.654 --> 01:38:20.226
Okay. Well. I understand you're
not wanting to marry me.

1692
01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:23.597
I won't make it that important
now.

1693
01:38:27.667 --> 01:38:34.274
But I'm not down with you being
a shitty partner.

1694
01:38:37.877 --> 01:38:38.679
I don't-

1695
01:38:39.779 --> 01:38:41.915
I'm not saying we have to spend

1696
01:38:41.948 --> 01:38:42.816
all our time together and I'm

1697
01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:43.917
not saying that we have to be

1698
01:38:44.016 --> 01:38:45.318
there for each other all the
time.

1699
01:38:45.417 --> 01:38:51.324
but I do want it to feel like
we're on the same team.

1700
01:38:53.661 --> 01:38:56.962
I do want it to feel we have
each other's backs.

1701
01:38:57.063 --> 01:38:58.699
Looking out for each other?

1702
01:38:58.931 --> 01:39:00.701
Yeah.

1703
01:39:30.997 --> 01:39:32.199
You tryin' to date me?

1704
01:39:32.832 --> 01:39:36.069
What? That was crazy.

1705
01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:11.003
All right.
Are you ready?

1706
01:40:11.037 --> 01:40:12.638
Okay. I'm ready.

1707
01:40:12.872 --> 01:40:16.143
We want a batter not
a broken arm.

1708
01:40:16.176 --> 01:40:17.711
Throw the ball. Chuck!

1709
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:18.778
All right. here it comes.

1710
01:40:23.082 --> 01:40:28.789
Oh. my gosh. it's goin'.

1711
01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:31.925
It's goin'. It's gone!

1712
01:40:32.125 --> 01:40:34.494
Oh. my God. It's a home run!
