836
00:41:41.691 --> 00:41:44.325

<i> richard. lives in oregon.</i>

837

839
00:41:49.031 --> 00:41:51.457
Which I knew was
a small town in oregon.

840
00:41:51.492 --> 00:41:55.586
So that caused me to search
property records in oakland

841

For someone named buxton.

842
00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.966

who are in their 80s.

843
00:42:00.001 --> 00:42:01.801
And they didn't know
anything about the names

844
00:42:01.836 --> 00:42:04.354
I was giving them.
but right before I hung up.

845

847
00:42:08.509 --> 00:42:10.643

and I did find him.

849

850
00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:17.534

851
00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.527

852
00:42:19.538 --> 00:42:22.321

853
00:42:22.398 --> 00:42:23.990

860
00:42:35.461 --> 00:42:36.569

882

903
00:44:54.842 --> 00:44:56.142
- Maybe that's
why he took her?

904
00:44:56.177 --> 00:44:58.144
He figured she could
make money for them.

905
00:44:58.179 --> 00:45:00.521

1009
00:50:46.527 --> 00:50:47.634
My name's john williams.
I'm a detective

1010
00:50:47.636 --> 00:50:51.789
With the polk county
sheriff's office up in oregon.

1011
00:50:51.865 --> 00:50:53.791
Wanted to know if you might
have a few minutes

1012
00:50:53.867 --> 00:50:55.793
I could talk to you
about kathy.

1013
00:50:55.869 --> 00:50:57.803
Who you were married to
years ago?

1014
00:51:00.374 --> 00:51:01.840
- The information
I've been able to find

1015
00:51:01.875 --> 00:51:04.176
Was that she had
a girl with you.

1016
00:51:04.211 --> 00:51:06.178
And I think
her name was tina.

1017

came out for that visit.

1031

Is he still possibly

And james "jug" gardner
was a laborer.

1051
00:53:07.927 --> 00:53:10.636
And what was interesting.
he rented an apartment

In the same building
that kathy lived in.

1053
00:53:12.839 --> 00:53:15.766
And they must have
hit it off.

1054
00:53:15.842 --> 00:53:18.101
<i> - At the time.</i>
<i> kathy was all alone.</i>

1055
00:53:18.178 --> 00:53:20.520
<i> She never had</i>
<i> any close friends.</i>

1056
00:53:20.531 --> 00:53:22.981
