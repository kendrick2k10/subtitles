- Please don't kill me.
- Shh!

83
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.016
You are in the
middle of nowhere.

84
00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:40.061
so you can keep running.
you can keep screaming.

85
00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:44.566
you can keep shouting.
you can keep crying.

86
00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:49.612
You can keep trying to
escape the inescapable.

87
00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:51.740
Go on.

88
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.414
And I will keep stabbing you

until your entire
mid-section is open.

You will be in so much pain.

91

So much you will beg
for me to kill you.

92
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:17.682

this will be over in a second.

I'm fine.

116
00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:12.881
I was worried.

117
00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:17.177
I'm fine.

118
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.345
You are not fine.

119
00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.429
You haven't slept in weeks.

120
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:20.805
You need rest.

121
00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:30.482

All right. spread out and see

You can answer the phone. John.

139
00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:34.921
They're probably calling
you about that serial killer

140
00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:37.090
we've been hearing about.

141
00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.258

(sighing) It's okay. babe.

146
00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.144

You're an ...

148

(car door slamming shut)

172
00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:35.834

182
00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.017
Why don't you follow me?

183

187
00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:02.402
Earlier this morning. a
local farmer called this in.

188
00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:04.112
said his dogs woke him up
in the middle of the night

189
00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:05.405
and dragged him
out into the woods.

190
00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:07.282
He found two women
tied to a tree.

191
00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:08.867
They're gonna be right
around the corner over here.

192
00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:09.951
Follow me.

193
00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:10.952
All right.

194
00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.707
- They're both hanging
up side by side

195
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:16.875
right around here.

196
00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.252
They look identical.

197
00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:21.755
I've never anything
like it before.

198
00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:23.089
Right over here.

199
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.759
And right over there.

200
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.593
(utensil clanking on counter)

201
00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.553
(gentle music)

202
00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:33.600
* Whoa

203
00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:38.271
* Whoa

204
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.190
Come on up here.

205
00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:41.024
Iceberg.

206
00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:44.319
I want you to meet
Special Agent Revis.

207
00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.112
He's gonna be working
this case with you.

208
00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:49.783
- John Iceberg Rollins.
man. nice to meet you.

209
00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:52.118
I'm sorry for your
loss. by the way. man.

210
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.163
- I specifically asked for
Iceberg's help on this case.

211
00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.623
- I'm not here to
step on any toes.

212
00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:59.292
- Step on toes. please. man.

So what are we looking for?

215
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.259
Bruisings. swelling.

216
00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.346
anything that shows
signs of a struggle.

217
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.223
We need to know if
these women fought

218
00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:14.599
or if they were drugged.

219
00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:15.809
Maybe even both.

220
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.268
Mm. does it matter?

221
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.773
- * I don't need you
- Everything matters.

222

224
00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.240
Tell your men to spread
out and search the area.

225
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:31.950
Make sure whoever did
this is not watching us

226
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.201
from the trees.

227
00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:34.202

331
00:24:19.751 --> 00:24:20.960
- It's been three months
- DGK. DGK!

332
00:24:21.002 --> 00:24:22.629
since child actor
turned college student

333
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:25.632
Janelle Jameson was
last seen at LAX airport

334
00:24:25.674 --> 00:24:27.133
- Since then.
- DGK. DGK!

335
00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:28.843
- People around the world are
waiting impatiently to see if

336
00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:31.346
she would be the latest victim
of the doppelganger killer.

337
00:24:31.388 --> 00:24:34.432
or as the kids like to
refer to him as DGK.

338
00:24:34.474 --> 00:24:37.477
Well. tonight that
question has been answered.

339
00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:38.937
Janelle Jameson was
found in the back woods

340
00:24:38.978 --> 00:24:41.648
of the Hatfield McCoy
Farm body painted

341
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:45.151
and bound to a tree opposite
of her doppelganger.

342
00:24:45.193 --> 00:24:45.985
What's going on here?

343
00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:47.445
It's like reality TV.

344
00:24:47.487 --> 00:24:48.905
We know we shouldn't
like it (giggling).

345
00:24:48.947 --> 00:24:51.408
but more than like it.
we obsessed with it.

346
00:24:51.449 --> 00:24:52.575
DGK!

347
00:24:52.617 --> 00:24:54.369
- DGK!
- So. excuse me. Agent.

348
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:55.870
Any clues as to
where DGK is hiding

349
00:24:55.912 --> 00:24:59.374
and what makes him so
difficult for the FBI to catch?

350
00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:00.291
- Move aside.
- Okay.

351
00:25:00.333 --> 00:25:01.668
Excuse. excuse my partner.

352
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.420
What he meant to
say was no comment.

353
00:25:03.461 --> 00:25:05.088
So what about you. Agent?

354
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.673
Agent Revis.

355
00:25:06.715 --> 00:25:09.551

00:25:12.512 --> 00:25:13.930

359
00:25:13.972 --> 00:25:16.307
and the other young lady
that was found here tonight?

360
00:25:16.349 --> 00:25:17.684
You know what Joanne. I do.

361
00:25:17.726 --> 00:25:19.978
I really don't like
living in a neighborhood

362
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.773
where the people who I
care about don't feel safe.

363
00:25:23.815 --> 00:25:25.608
You have it first. Houston.

364
00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:27.610
DGK may have gotten
away yet again.

365
00:25:27.652 --> 00:25:30.697
but with people like
Agent Revis on the case.

366
00:25:30.739 --> 00:25:35.285
it won't be long before
DGK is put into J. A. I. L.

367
00:25:35.326 --> 00:25:36.119
Jail.

368
00:25:36.161 --> 00:25:37.203
Yes.

369
00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:38.079
Is that all?

370
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:39.372
Yes.

371
00:25:39.414 --> 00:25:40.582
Thank you.

372
00:25:40.623 --> 00:25:41.541
Anytime.

373
00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:43.835
I might hold you to that.

374
00:25:45.003 --> 00:25:47.756
(ominous music)

375
00:25:53.428 --> 00:25:55.388
- You know the worst
part about my job guys.

376
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.766
is watching people have to
come in here and identify the

377
00:25:57.807 --> 00:26:00.060
bodies of those that they love.

378
00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:02.062
And you would think by now
that I'd be numb to this shit.

379
00:26:02.103 --> 00:26:03.063
but I'm not.

380
00:26:04.564 --> 00:26:06.733
Um. are you all right?

381
00:26:06.775 --> 00:26:09.235
- I. I'm. I'm fine.
Agent Rollins.

382
00:26:09.277 --> 00:26:10.070
I'm. I'm sorry.

383
00:26:10.111 --> 00:26:11.738
I mean. Iceberg.

384
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.367
I only have a half hour left
with no more bodies to cut up.

385
00:26:15.408 --> 00:26:16.743
Anyway.

386
00:26:16.785 --> 00:26:18.161
this one right here
is Paislee Parks

387
00:26:18.203 --> 00:26:21.456
and her parents just left from
here identifying her body.

388
00:26:21.498 --> 00:26:23.541
She and the movie star.

389
00:26:23.583 --> 00:26:25.251
- Movie Star?
- Yes. movie star.

390
00:26:25.293 --> 00:26:26.878
That's what she was. right?

391
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.798
- Well. uh. she wasn't. she
wasn't necessarily a movie star.

392
00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:32.717
I would call her.
it was a TV show.

393
00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:33.760
And actually while she wasn't

394
00:26:33.802 --> 00:26:35.553
- the star of the show.
- Revis.

395
00:26:35.595 --> 00:26:36.763
Hold on. gimme a second.

396
00:26:36.805 --> 00:26:37.806
While she wasn't the
real star. the real star

397
00:26:37.847 --> 00:26:39.683
- was really her brother.
- Revis.

398
00:26:39.724 --> 00:26:40.892
- Arnold Green.
- Revis.

399
00:26:40.934 --> 00:26:41.935
He had a line in there.

400
00:26:41.976 --> 00:26:43.978
- "Hmm. I Wonder if..."
- Revis.

401
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.691
- Anyway. guys. both women
suffer from the exact same type

402
00:26:47.732 --> 00:26:48.942
of puncture wound.

403
00:26:48.983 --> 00:26:52.445
a knife to their
abdominal aorta.

404
00:26:52.487 --> 00:26:54.739
Why to the abdominal aorta?

405
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:57.701
Why not to the
wrist or the throat?

406
00:26:57.742 --> 00:27:00.870
- The wrist or the neck
would be too messy.

407
00:27:00.912 --> 00:27:03.039
Stabbing the victim
through the abdominal aorta

408
00:27:03.081 --> 00:27:06.084
is the quickest way to kill
them. and it's the cleanest.

409
00:27:06.126 --> 00:27:08.461
Makes it easier for him
to body paint afterwards.

410
00:27:08.503 --> 00:27:12.257
- (ominous music)
- That's right.

411
00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:23.184
(typewriters tapping)

412
00:27:32.736 --> 00:27:34.946
[Woman] It's over there.

413
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.829
- What the Fuck y'all
doing. get back to work.

414
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:45.832
Man.

415
00:27:45.874 --> 00:27:47.459
- I have to make a
phone call real quick.

416
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.127
Yeah. for sure. man.

417
00:27:53.256 --> 00:27:54.466
(Rollins sighing)

418
00:27:54.507 --> 00:27:56.676
Hey sweetheart. if um.

419
00:27:56.718 --> 00:27:58.803
if you're sleeping
good. don't wake up.

420
00:27:58.845 --> 00:28:00.388
I was just calling
to check on you.

421
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.098
I'm sorry I'm not there.

422
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.310
But uh. give me call
when you wake up.

423
00:28:09.356 --> 00:28:11.358
Revis. lemme ask you a question.

424
00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:12.275
[Revis] Yo.

425
00:28:13.902 --> 00:28:16.363
- What do you see when
you look at this wall?

426
00:28:16.404 --> 00:28:17.238
Uh.

427
00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:19.366
Uh.

428
00:28:19.407 --> 00:28:20.241
I see a.

429
00:28:21.242 --> 00:28:22.869
I see an artist.

430
00:28:22.911 --> 00:28:25.538
um. possibly a twin.

431
00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.665
We got some twin
scenarios over here.

432
00:28:27.707 --> 00:28:28.708
And you know. for
the past three years

433
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:30.960
we've been looking for an.

434
00:28:31.002 --> 00:28:34.422
an artist who's a twin with
some type of a criminal history.

435
00:28:34.464 --> 00:28:35.882
Or.

436
00:28:35.924 --> 00:28:38.259
or. or a background
of violent behavior.

437
00:28:38.301 --> 00:28:40.887
- Okay. well let's just forget
the psychology for a second.

438
00:28:40.929 --> 00:28:42.764
Just give me the basics.
(Revis chuckling)

439
00:28:42.806 --> 00:28:43.598
How does he do it?

440
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.266
How does he move?

441
00:28:45.308 --> 00:28:49.104
- Well. he finds his
victim a man or a woman.

442
00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:52.023
And then he keeps
them tucked away

443
00:28:52.065 --> 00:28:54.984
for as long as he finds
their doppelganger.

444
00:28:55.026 --> 00:28:56.653
Once he finds the doppelganger.

445
00:28:56.695 --> 00:28:58.071
he kills them both.
(woman groaning)

446
00:28:58.113 --> 00:28:59.364
And then he paints their bodies

447
00:28:59.406 --> 00:29:02.826
and then he makes it
in a fashion of art

448
00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:04.953
- as you see here.
- Yep.

449
00:29:04.994 --> 00:29:06.746
Is there a timetable?

450
00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:07.997
Well.

451
00:29:08.039 --> 00:29:10.000
the first one took
about three years.

452
00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:12.877
The next one took about
a year and a half.

453
00:29:12.919 --> 00:29:16.423
Now this one we have just
now. that took about uh.

454
00:29:16.464 --> 00:29:17.298
thirty days.

455
00:29:18.508 --> 00:29:20.719
So he's getting better.

456
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.553
[Man 3] Hey. yo. Revis.

457
00:29:21.594 --> 00:29:22.929
Yo.

458
00:29:22.971 --> 00:29:23.847
- [Man 3] You might
wanna pick up line two.

459
00:29:23.888 --> 00:29:26.224
It's that fine ass reporter.

460
00:29:34.649 --> 00:29:38.194
- Special Agent
Revis FBI. go ahead.

461
00:29:38.236 --> 00:29:39.988
- Ferdinand. how are you?
- Ferdinand. hey.

462
00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:40.947
I know who this is?

463
00:29:40.989 --> 00:29:42.282
Hey Joanne. how you doing?

464
00:29:42.323 --> 00:29:42.991
How you doing?

465
00:29:43.033 --> 00:29:44.451
Um. how can I help you?

466
00:29:44.492 --> 00:29:47.746
- I was wondering if you would
like to get a cup of coffee?

467
00:29:47.787 --> 00:29:48.955
Wait a minute.

468
00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:50.665
Are you trying to poke
me for DGK information?

469
00:29:50.707 --> 00:29:51.624
No.

470
00:29:51.666 --> 00:29:53.084
I just like who you are as a man

471
00:29:53.126 --> 00:29:54.627
and I would like to
get to know you better

472
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:56.129
over a cup of coffee.

473
00:29:56.171 --> 00:29:58.465
- (clearing throat) I would
love to get that cup of coffee.

474
00:29:58.506 --> 00:30:00.008
with you. Joanne.

475
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.301
- Okay. so each one of DGK's
- But um. uh.

476
00:30:01.343 --> 00:30:02.677
- I gotta get back to work
- Victims where last seen

477
00:30:02.719 --> 00:30:04.137
- Right now
- in different parts

478
00:30:04.179 --> 00:30:05.889
of the world and then
found dead here in Houston.

479
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:07.223
[Revis] Right.

480
00:30:07.265 --> 00:30:11.186
So Lonnie Lewis. he was
last seen in Australia.

481
00:30:14.356 --> 00:30:15.982
Stella Estefan.

482
00:30:16.024 --> 00:30:18.610
she was last seen in Mexico.

483
00:30:18.651 --> 00:30:20.236
And then we've got
Janelle Jameson.

484
00:30:20.278 --> 00:30:22.322
she was actually spotted
on LAX surveillance

485
00:30:22.364 --> 00:30:24.532
with an airline pilot the
night she went missing.

486
00:30:24.574 --> 00:30:25.992
We know.

487
00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:27.994
We've been searching the
whole Houston database

488
00:30:28.036 --> 00:30:29.579
for pilots coming in and out

489
00:30:29.621 --> 00:30:31.498
on the nights of
the kidnappings.

490
00:30:31.539 --> 00:30:33.166
So far we have nothing

491
00:30:33.208 --> 00:30:37.462
that links any of the
victims to any one pilot.

492
00:30:37.504 --> 00:30:38.213
Okay.

493
00:30:39.255 --> 00:30:41.549
And lastly. we
have Paislee Parks.

494
00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:42.801
She was the only one not seen

495
00:30:42.842 --> 00:30:44.219
in a different
part of the world.

496
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.930
She was actually at an arts
exhibition here in Houston.

497
00:30:46.971 --> 00:30:49.891
(mid tempo music)

498
00:30:59.859 --> 00:31:01.069
Mark Tru?

499
00:31:02.112 --> 00:31:02.862
Yes.

500
00:31:02.904 --> 00:31:04.280
John Rollins. FBI.

501
00:31:04.322 --> 00:31:06.825
This is my partner.
Special Agent Wilford.

502
00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:07.742
Is this?

503
00:31:07.784 --> 00:31:09.119
- How you doing?
- All right.

504
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.370
Is this about last night?

505
00:31:10.412 --> 00:31:11.996
Yes. uh.

506
00:31:12.038 --> 00:31:13.498
the event was this
invitation only. correct?

507
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.624
Correct. uh.

508
00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:16.126
my younger brother has autism.

509
00:31:16.167 --> 00:31:18.294
so every year I invite a few
important friends to my gallery

510
00:31:18.336 --> 00:31:21.214
to auction off few pieces
for the Tru Foundation.

511
00:31:21.256 --> 00:31:23.633
We're dedicated to helping
children with autism.

512
00:31:23.675 --> 00:31:24.801
It's beautiful.

513
00:31:24.843 --> 00:31:27.554
It was a very private affair.

514
00:31:27.595 --> 00:31:29.014
And you are?

515
00:31:29.055 --> 00:31:31.725
- Margo. Mr. Tru's
personal secretary.

516
00:31:31.766 --> 00:31:33.059
- Margo's much more
than a secretary.

517
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:35.061
She does all the actual
work around here.

518
00:31:35.103 --> 00:31:36.896
including the planning
for the True Foundation.

519
00:31:36.938 --> 00:31:38.523
Wait. you planned the event?

520
00:31:38.565 --> 00:31:39.941
Yes. I did.

521
00:31:39.983 --> 00:31:41.860
- And I'm assuming you
knew everyone who attended?

522
00:31:41.901 --> 00:31:43.778
We know mostly everyone. yes.

523
00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.905
- All invited guests
were allowed a plus one.

524
00:31:45.947 --> 00:31:47.532
So there's a guest list?

525
00:31:47.574 --> 00:31:48.742
Yes.

526
00:31:48.783 --> 00:31:49.951
- Was Paislee
Parks on that list?

527
00:31:49.993 --> 00:31:50.994
Absolutely.

528
00:31:51.036 --> 00:31:52.787
Paislee was a childhood friend.

529
00:31:52.829 --> 00:31:54.873
Her family helped me to
open my first gallery.

530
00:31:54.914 --> 00:31:57.167
I owe everything I have to them.

531
00:31:57.208 --> 00:31:59.252
- When was the last
time you saw Ms. Parks?

532
00:31:59.294 --> 00:32:01.254
- She was standing
right over there

533
00:32:01.296 --> 00:32:04.424
talking to some large
scrumptious piece of man.

534
00:32:04.466 --> 00:32:06.968
(group laughing)

535
00:32:10.472 --> 00:32:12.015
And then they left.

536
00:32:12.057 --> 00:32:13.600
- Wait. you saw
who she left with?

537
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:14.726
I saw her with a man.

538
00:32:14.768 --> 00:32:16.269
I don't know who he was.

539
00:32:16.311 --> 00:32:19.731
- Then. how do you know
he. he was scrumptious.

540
00:32:19.773 --> 00:32:21.524
I saw what I needed to see.

541
00:32:21.566 --> 00:32:22.776
Which was what?

542
00:32:22.817 --> 00:32:23.943
His eyes were dark.

543
00:32:23.985 --> 00:32:26.071
His skin was milk.
chocolate and smooth.

544
00:32:26.112 --> 00:32:27.739
He was wearing a black suit.

545
00:32:27.781 --> 00:32:29.783
He had a very masculine build.

546
00:32:29.824 --> 00:32:31.868
You would think
he lived in a gym.

547
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:33.703
- Okay. so what
about surveillance?

548
00:32:33.745 --> 00:32:35.121
Cameras were off.

549
00:32:35.163 --> 00:32:37.415
Our guests do not
like to be recorded.

550
00:32:37.457 --> 00:32:39.125
They're the type
of wealthy people

551
00:32:39.167 --> 00:32:41.294
that don't like to take credit
for the money that they give.

552
00:32:41.336 --> 00:32:43.171
but can't wait to brag about it

553
00:32:43.213 --> 00:32:46.383
amongst their other
wealthy friends.

554
00:32:46.424 --> 00:32:47.300
Margo right?

555
00:32:47.342 --> 00:32:48.468
Yes.

556
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:49.803
- Do you mind if we get
a copy of that list?

557
00:32:49.844 --> 00:32:51.096
Not at all.

558
00:32:54.808 --> 00:32:56.851
- Who's the artist
of this piece?

559
00:32:56.893 --> 00:32:58.770
Actually. I have no idea.

560
00:32:58.812 --> 00:33:00.313
Paislee brought
it in last night.

561
00:33:00.355 --> 00:33:01.690
I don't really see what's
so special about it.

562
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:06.361
but she was adamant that I
hang it up for the auction.

563
00:33:07.862 --> 00:33:08.947
Thank you for your time.

564
00:33:08.988 --> 00:33:10.198
Certainly.

565
00:33:13.159 --> 00:33:16.079
(phone ringing)

566
00:33:18.873 --> 00:33:21.626
(ominous music)

567
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:42.564
(knocking on door)

568
00:33:45.608 --> 00:33:47.068
Can I help you?

569
00:33:49.404 --> 00:33:51.781
- FBI. we're looking
for Mario Allen.

570
00:33:51.823 --> 00:33:53.158
Uh. I'm his daughter. Rae.

571
00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:54.409
What do you want with him?

572
00:33:54.451 --> 00:33:56.327
- We just wanna ask
him a few questions.

573
00:33:56.369 --> 00:33:57.996
Yeah. that's not gonna happen.

574
00:33:58.038 --> 00:34:00.081
My dad passed away
a few days ago.

575
00:34:00.123 --> 00:34:01.082
Car crash.

576
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:04.127
Sorry to hear. sorry.

577
00:34:04.169 --> 00:34:05.462
I'm sorry it happened.

578
00:34:05.503 --> 00:34:08.089
(upbeat music)

579
00:34:17.265 --> 00:34:22.103
* You can't get
enough reaction

580
00:34:25.106 --> 00:34:30.153
* Oh come on. don't
play me for a fool

581
00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:37.577
* With your strap stuck in
girl you such a distraction

582
00:34:40.789 --> 00:34:43.875
* I've got one and one and one

583
00:34:43.917 --> 00:34:48.672
* But you're so cool

584
00:34:49.798 --> 00:34:51.257
* Oh won't you call me

585
00:34:51.299 --> 00:34:54.302
* Beg me cause
you feel so good

586
00:34:54.344 --> 00:34:56.137
* Come get you down and dirty

587
00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:58.306
* Won't you do my back up here

588
00:34:58.348 --> 00:35:02.268
* Gonna make you beg me
cause you feel so good

589
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:04.437
* Come get you down and dirty

590
00:35:04.479 --> 00:35:05.730
* Won't you do my back up here

591
00:35:05.772 --> 00:35:08.942
* I'll make you beg me
cause you feel so good

592
00:35:08.983 --> 00:35:11.778
* It's so good

593
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.363
(planks rattling)

594
00:35:13.405 --> 00:35:16.658
(Mike clearing throat)

595
00:35:18.868 --> 00:35:21.579
(whooshing music)

596
00:35:27.752 --> 00:35:30.714
(knock on door)

597
00:35:30.755 --> 00:35:31.965
Mike Hamlin?

598
00:35:32.007 --> 00:35:33.258
Yup.

599
00:35:33.299 --> 00:35:34.634
[Rollins] FBI.

600
00:35:36.094 --> 00:35:37.220
I'm busy.

601
00:35:37.929 --> 00:35:40.515
This won't take but a minute.

602
00:35:42.225 --> 00:35:44.769
- What does the FBI want
with little old Mike Hamlin?

603
00:35:44.811 --> 00:35:45.603
DGK.

604
00:35:46.855 --> 00:35:48.356
Doppelganger killer?

605
00:35:48.398 --> 00:35:49.816
You're familiar with him?

606
00:35:49.858 --> 00:35:51.985
- I do a little news
peeping from time to time.

607
00:35:52.027 --> 00:35:53.820
Yeah.

608
00:35:53.862 --> 00:35:55.488
See all those T-shirts outside.

609
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.157
Large crowds worshiping this guy

610
00:35:57.198 --> 00:35:59.451
like he's the second
coming of public Picasso.

611
00:35:59.492 --> 00:36:02.412
- You seem agitated. man.
- Of course I'm agitated.

612
00:36:02.454 --> 00:36:05.832
I'm over here pouring my heart
and soul into my artwork.

613
00:36:05.874 --> 00:36:07.542
getting fucking nowhere.

614
00:36:07.584 --> 00:36:11.171
And so long as those idiots
out there are cheering him on.

615
00:36:11.212 --> 00:36:13.673
pepping him up. buying
buying his fucking T-shirts.

616
00:36:13.715 --> 00:36:16.009
the more destructive
he's likely gonna be.

617
00:36:16.051 --> 00:36:16.843
And this guy. what?

618
00:36:16.885 --> 00:36:18.053
He kills three people.

619
00:36:18.094 --> 00:36:21.097
A few. I don't know how many.

620
00:36:21.139 --> 00:36:24.309
Fuck. the whole world stops.

621
00:36:24.351 --> 00:36:26.770
And now they're talking about
him being the greatest artist

622
00:36:26.811 --> 00:36:29.272
of our fucking generation.

623
00:36:29.314 --> 00:36:33.777
- Did you attend a charity
event last night in Houston?

624
00:36:33.818 --> 00:36:35.195
Yes. I did.

625
00:36:35.236 --> 00:36:37.781
Did you leave with anyone?

626
00:36:37.822 --> 00:36:38.907
No. I did not.

627
00:36:40.033 --> 00:36:42.452
So you two. let yourselves out.

628
00:37:01.137 --> 00:37:03.306
(bottle smacking against wall)

629
00:37:03.348 --> 00:37:06.976
(birds chirping)

630
00:37:07.018 --> 00:37:08.436
(knocking on door)

631
00:37:08.478 --> 00:37:13.274
(whooshing music)
(people shouting)

632
00:37:14.776 --> 00:37:16.194
(dog barking)

633
00:37:16.236 --> 00:37:19.030
- Are you guys looking
for Donald Keller.

634
00:37:21.116 --> 00:37:22.909
Special agent John Rollins.

635
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:24.369
This is my partner.

636
00:37:24.411 --> 00:37:25.954
Special Agent Revis.

637
00:37:25.995 --> 00:37:27.580
Is he in trouble?

638
00:37:27.622 --> 00:37:29.374
No. we just wanna talk to him.

639
00:37:29.416 --> 00:37:31.084
- Well. you won't
find him in there.

640
00:37:31.126 --> 00:37:32.919
He usually flies on Wednesdays.

641
00:37:32.961 --> 00:37:34.671
He is an airplane pilot.

642
00:37:34.713 --> 00:37:35.755
And you are?

643
00:37:35.797 --> 00:37:37.507
Larry Walters.

644
00:37:37.549 --> 00:37:40.677
I'm the maintenance
man for this building.

645
00:37:40.719 --> 00:37:44.180
- Hey. Larry. you mind if we
have a look in here real quick?

646
00:37:44.222 --> 00:37:46.599
I don't usually do this.

647
00:37:46.641 --> 00:37:50.603
but I was on my way in
there to fix a leaky faucet.

648
00:37:50.645 --> 00:37:52.022
I won't suggest one of
you fellows know anything

649
00:37:52.063 --> 00:37:53.648
about leaky faucet. huh?

650
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:54.649
I sure do.

651
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:57.068
- I. I sure. I
do. I do and will.

652
00:38:02.949 --> 00:38:05.326
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

653
00:38:05.368 --> 00:38:08.121
Let's have a look
around real quick.

654
00:38:08.163 --> 00:38:09.622
(tool bag slamming on counter)

655
00:38:09.664 --> 00:38:13.126
- You're looking for
the DGK. aren't you?

656
00:38:13.168 --> 00:38:14.461
What makes you say that?

657
00:38:14.502 --> 00:38:16.171
I've seen this guy on TV.

658
00:38:16.212 --> 00:38:17.922
He's looks like a
real standup guy.

659
00:38:17.964 --> 00:38:20.091
A real likable hero.

660
00:38:20.133 --> 00:38:21.134
Well appreciate that. Larry.

661
00:38:21.176 --> 00:38:22.719
I appreciate that.

662
00:38:22.761 --> 00:38:25.096
- I always thought there was
something funny about this guy.

663
00:38:25.138 --> 00:38:26.973
Funny. Like how?

664
00:38:27.015 --> 00:38:28.391
Look at his apartment.

665
00:38:28.433 --> 00:38:30.060
And the guy's a
fucking neat freak.

666
00:38:30.101 --> 00:38:31.227
And not to mention

667
00:38:31.269 --> 00:38:33.980
he got two of almost everything.

668
00:38:34.022 --> 00:38:35.690
I asked him. "Fool.

669
00:38:35.732 --> 00:38:37.025
why do you have to have two
of so much in your apartment?"

670
00:38:37.067 --> 00:38:38.651
What'd he say?

671
00:38:38.693 --> 00:38:40.278
- He said he has a obsessive
compulsive disorder.

672
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.156
which causes him to have
to see things and twos.

673
00:38:43.198 --> 00:38:44.616
What about two women?

674
00:38:44.657 --> 00:38:46.159
Does he need two of those?

675
00:38:46.201 --> 00:38:48.119
- [Larry] Good
question. I never asked.

676
00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:49.537
Oh. freaky boy.

677
00:38:49.579 --> 00:38:50.830
I know. I know.
if it was me. I...

678
00:38:50.872 --> 00:38:53.166
- You can't go in there
unless you have a warrant.

679
00:38:53.208 --> 00:38:54.292
Mr. Keller specifically asked

680
00:38:54.334 --> 00:38:56.586
that I never enter his bedroom.

681
00:38:56.628 --> 00:38:58.380
- Why do you think
that is. Larry?

682
00:38:58.421 --> 00:38:59.839
It's his bedroom.

683
00:38:59.881 --> 00:39:01.716
No telling what type of
freaky shit he got going on.

684
00:39:01.758 --> 00:39:05.011
but whatever it is. it's
his personal business.

685
00:39:05.053 --> 00:39:07.722
(ominous music)

686
00:39:34.457 --> 00:39:37.460
(door squeaking)

687
00:39:50.432 --> 00:39:53.977
(ominous music continues)

688
00:40:21.254 --> 00:40:24.799
(ominous music continues)

689
00:40:41.107 --> 00:40:44.152
(gentle piano music)

690
00:41:04.422 --> 00:41:07.175
(ominous music)

691
00:41:08.218 --> 00:41:10.929
[Woman] Doctor's catalog. 320.

692
00:41:16.267 --> 00:41:19.187
(indistinct chatter)

693
00:41:26.486 --> 00:41:27.487
(waves sploshing)

694
00:41:27.529 --> 00:41:30.532
(birds chirping)

695
00:41:55.557 --> 00:41:58.143
- We're gonna find
your wife. Iceberg.

696
00:41:58.184 --> 00:42:00.020
I promise you that bro.

697
00:42:01.396 --> 00:42:03.690
He took a boat.

698
00:42:03.732 --> 00:42:05.191
We were looking for him
in the fucking woods

699
00:42:05.233 --> 00:42:06.776
and he took the boat.

700
00:42:13.324 --> 00:42:16.202
(gentle rock music)

701
00:43:03.416 --> 00:43:07.295
(gentle rock music continues)

702
00:43:12.384 --> 00:43:15.637
(door latch clanking)

703
00:43:23.478 --> 00:43:26.231
(door creaking)

704
00:43:33.655 --> 00:43:37.242
(Blessing sighing)

705
00:43:37.283 --> 00:43:38.827
Who are you?

706
00:43:38.868 --> 00:43:41.830
- My name is Donald.
Graham. Keller

707
00:43:46.501 --> 00:43:47.419
Hi.

708
00:43:49.087 --> 00:43:49.796
Donald.

709
00:43:52.841 --> 00:43:56.177
- My name Blessing.
- So Blessing Rollins.

710
00:43:58.179 --> 00:43:59.180
psychologist.

711
00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.434
specializing in phobias.

712
00:44:02.475 --> 00:44:04.019
I know who you are.

713
00:44:05.645 --> 00:44:07.272
You are the unjust.

714
00:44:09.774 --> 00:44:13.153
And your day of
reckoning is coming.

715
00:44:13.194 --> 00:44:14.404
You're judging me?

716
00:44:14.446 --> 00:44:16.031
Yes I am.

717
00:44:16.072 --> 00:44:16.698
Why?

718
00:44:20.535 --> 00:44:22.120
You chose death.

719
00:44:23.705 --> 00:44:27.751
I decided to affect others
with your solid education.

720
00:44:29.502 --> 00:44:30.879
You're insane.

721
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.718
(Donald laughing)

722
00:44:41.222 --> 00:44:44.559
- Of course I'm
insane. Dr. Rollins.

723
00:44:44.601 --> 00:44:46.686
We all are to some degree.

724
00:44:46.728 --> 00:44:49.689
but you don't want
to hear that do you?

725
00:44:49.731 --> 00:44:51.483
You want me to say
that I am not insane.

726
00:44:51.524 --> 00:44:53.401
so you can say that I'm insane

727
00:44:53.443 --> 00:44:56.946
and feel better about having
done all of those degrees

728
00:44:56.988 --> 00:45:00.200
and sit on your ass and
listen to all the cheer.

729
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:03.828
But you don't know shit
about true insanity!

730
00:45:06.414 --> 00:45:10.043
- I know more than you
think I know. Donald.

731
00:45:10.085 --> 00:45:13.755
- Have you ever truly
been insane. Dr. Rollins?

732
00:45:13.797 --> 00:45:17.676
Have you ever lived
in a dead mind?

733
00:45:17.717 --> 00:45:19.678
Have you ever
orchestrated thoughts

734
00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:22.639
that would only
play unwanted music?

735
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:25.642
Have you ever been
who you are not

736
00:45:25.684 --> 00:45:28.728
and not been able
to be who you are?

737
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:29.813
Have you?

738
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.735
(Donald sighing)

739
00:45:35.777 --> 00:45:37.779
Of course you haven't.

740
00:45:40.407 --> 00:45:41.950
You're him.

741
00:45:41.991 --> 00:45:44.327
You're the doppelganger killer.

742
00:45:44.369 --> 00:45:45.578
(Blessing panting)

743
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.163
You've heard of me?

744
00:45:48.707 --> 00:45:51.084
My husband's FBI.

745
00:45:51.126 --> 00:45:53.253
Of course I have heard of you.

746
00:45:53.294 --> 00:45:55.588
You kidnap random people and
hold them against their will

747
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.800
until you can find
their doppelganger.

748
00:46:01.636 --> 00:46:03.638
Is that what this is?

749
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.017
(Blessing panting and sobbing)

750
00:46:07.058 --> 00:46:09.436
Are you gonna kill me?

751
00:46:09.477 --> 00:46:11.312
You are the unjust.

752
00:46:11.354 --> 00:46:12.772
What did I do?

753
00:46:12.814 --> 00:46:15.942
- You killed innocent
babies without remorse.

754
00:46:19.821 --> 00:46:21.823
- My husband is out
there looking for me.

755
00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:24.159
backed by the most powerful
law enforcement agency

756
00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.076
in the world.

757
00:46:30.123 --> 00:46:30.832
I know.

758
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.336
I know the FBI is after me.

759
00:46:35.503 --> 00:46:37.339
I am also not afraid.

760
00:46:39.632 --> 00:46:41.718
That's your first mistake.

761
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.511
You should be afraid.

762
00:46:44.804 --> 00:46:47.057
My husband is a very
rational human being.

763
00:46:47.098 --> 00:46:52.520
But when pushed to the point
of anger. he has no control.

764
00:46:52.562 --> 00:46:54.814
He is gonna find you.

765
00:46:54.856 --> 00:46:56.358
He is gonna know what
you have done to me.

766
00:46:56.399 --> 00:46:58.443
And he's gonna march right
in here without hesitation

767
00:46:58.485 --> 00:47:00.820
and put bullets right
in your fucking face.

768
00:47:00.862 --> 00:47:04.157
(Donald laughing)

769
00:47:04.199 --> 00:47:09.037
(Donald's hands clapping)
(Donald continues laughing)

770
00:47:10.955 --> 00:47:12.874
I hope you're right.

771
00:47:13.667 --> 00:47:15.502
I really hope you're right.

772
00:47:15.543 --> 00:47:20.048
I hope that Special Agent
John Rollins. aka Iceberg

773
00:47:23.218 --> 00:47:27.013
will just walk out here and
point a gun right into my head

774
00:47:27.055 --> 00:47:30.517
and empty some bullets
without hesitations.

775
00:47:30.558 --> 00:47:32.018
I hope you're right.

776
00:47:34.521 --> 00:47:36.147
You are the unjust.

777
00:47:37.732 --> 00:47:41.528
The children need to
be saved from you.

778
00:47:41.569 --> 00:47:42.362
and the art.

779
00:47:44.364 --> 00:47:46.574
(Donald sighing)

780
00:47:46.616 --> 00:47:49.369
the art needs to
be immortalized.

781
00:47:49.411 --> 00:47:51.913
(ominous music)

782
00:47:52.789 --> 00:47:55.208
You see. I am the righteous.

783
00:47:56.084 --> 00:47:57.919
The people love me.

784
00:47:58.837 --> 00:48:01.715
They call out my
name everywhere.

785
00:48:01.756 --> 00:48:04.426
Because of me.
justice will prevail.

786
00:48:05.635 --> 00:48:08.388
(ominous music)

787
00:48:10.056 --> 00:48:12.684
(upbeat music)

788
00:48:20.108 --> 00:48:24.237
- So what made you
want to join the FBI?

789
00:48:24.279 --> 00:48:26.489
- I was lost. I needed
some direction in life.

790
00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:29.075
A recruiter thought I'd be
a good fit. and here we are.

791
00:48:29.117 --> 00:48:32.287
So what made you
wanna be a reporter?

792
00:48:32.328 --> 00:48:33.038
Same thing.

793
00:48:33.079 --> 00:48:34.122
Plus. I'm nosy.

794
00:48:34.164 --> 00:48:36.624
(Joanne and Revis laughing)

795
00:48:36.666 --> 00:48:37.876
(Joanne sighing)

796
00:48:37.917 --> 00:48:39.044
I like you.

797
00:48:41.296 --> 00:48:44.632
I don't like anybody.
but I like you.

798
00:48:44.674 --> 00:48:46.176
I like you more.

799
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:50.096
Let's get out of here.

800
00:48:50.138 --> 00:48:52.557
I have something

801
00:48:52.599 --> 00:48:54.768

Yes. it is.

805
00:49:00.315 --> 00:49:02.025
- Some would say it's
made for sleeping.

806
00:49:02.067 --> 00:49:03.026
Some people.

807
00:49:03.068 --> 00:49:05.153

You're wasting your
time trying to feed me.

00:53:37.175 --> 00:53:38.510
If I eat the food

So my wife's alive.

(people sighing)

862
00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:41.281
That's the good news.

863
00:54:41.322 --> 00:54:43.491
The Doppelganger
killer can't kill her

00:54:43.533 --> 00:54:45.744
until he finds her
doppelganger. right?

865
00:54:45.785 --> 00:54:47.078
Right.

searching for someone

867
00:54:49.289 --> 00:54:51.958

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.794
When he finds this woman.
he's gonna kill them both.

869
00:54:54.836 --> 00:54:56.171
[Woman 4] Wow.

Now this is just one man.

00:55:07.015 --> 00:55:11.102
Get eyes on her. and then
wait for DGK to show his face.

878
00:55:15.357 --> 00:55:16.775

881
00:55:20.987 --> 00:55:22.447
If I didn't know any better.

882
00:55:22.489 --> 00:55:24.199
I would think she was your
wife. y'all take a look.

883
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.701

902
00:56:00.318 --> 00:56:02.862
I want her found and I
want her surveilled 24/7.

903
00:56:02.904 --> 00:56:06.866
In other words. I wanna
know every move she makes.

904
00:56:06.908 --> 00:56:08.535
All right. everybody
has an assignment?

905
00:56:08.576 --> 00:56:10.328
- Yes sir.
- Yes.

906
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:11.413
- Does anybody
have any questions?

907
00:56:11.454 --> 00:56:13.540
- No. sir.
- No.

908
00:56:13.581 --> 00:56:16.418
- Iceberg. where do
you want me and Sparks?

909
00:56:16.459 --> 00:56:18.211
I want you two with me.

910
00:56:18.253 --> 00:56:19.546
All right. let's get to it.

911
00:56:19.587 --> 00:56:20.755
Let's hit the streets.

912
00:56:20.797 --> 00:56:23.508
(hands clapping)

913
00:56:27.262 --> 00:56:30.056
(latch rattling)

914
00:56:32.142 --> 00:56:35.937
(lock clanking on floor)

915
00:56:35.979 --> 00:56:38.440
(door creaking)

916
00:56:46.239 --> 00:56:48.783
You still haven't eaten?

917
00:56:48.825 --> 00:56:49.659
No.

918
00:56:54.831 --> 00:56:55.540
Why?

919
00:56:56.666 --> 00:56:59.669
- Because there are
drugs in the food.

920
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.471
(plates echoing on floor)

921
00:57:12.974 --> 00:57:16.144
- But if you don't
eat. you will die.

922
00:57:23.068 --> 00:57:24.819
I'm gonna die anyway.

923
00:57:31.576 --> 00:57:33.078
(Donald sighing)

924
00:57:33.119 --> 00:57:33.953
Okay.

925
00:57:42.504 --> 00:57:45.632
(Banana snapping)

926
00:57:58.853 --> 00:58:00.271
Eat Your food?

927
00:58:00.313 --> 00:58:01.147
No.

928
00:58:07.529 --> 00:58:09.030
Eat your food.

929
00:58:09.072 --> 00:58:10.448
I said no.

930
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:12.575
- (Blessing screaming)
- Eat you fucking food!

931
00:58:12.617 --> 00:58:13.952
Eat your food!

932
00:58:13.993 --> 00:58:15.662
Put it in your
fucking mouth. eat it!

933
00:58:15.704 --> 00:58:17.580
Eat your fucking...!

934
00:58:19.249 --> 00:58:22.085
(Blessing choking and coughing)

935
00:58:22.127 --> 00:58:23.503
God.

936
00:58:23.545 --> 00:58:25.463
I am so sorry.

937
00:58:25.505 --> 00:58:27.173
I am so sorry.

938
00:58:27.215 --> 00:58:30.093
(Blessing screaming)

939
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:39.102
(Donald breathing heavily)

940
00:58:39.144 --> 00:58:41.980
(Blessing choking)

941
00:58:42.022 --> 00:58:46.026
Why can't you just be
like the others. huh?

942
00:58:46.067 --> 00:58:49.696
Why can't you just
accept the inevitable?

943
00:58:49.738 --> 00:58:50.572
Why?

944
00:58:52.198 --> 00:58:54.200
Cause I have a life.

945
00:58:54.242 --> 00:58:55.660
I have a husband.

946
00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.873
I'm not just gonna
sit here and die

947
00:58:59.914 --> 00:59:04.210
so you can feel better about
what you're doing to me.

948
00:59:04.252 --> 00:59:06.880
(Blessing crying)

949
00:59:09.758 --> 00:59:11.843
Eat your fucking food.

950
00:59:14.679 --> 00:59:16.222
You eat it.

951
00:59:16.264 --> 00:59:17.766
Just eat your food.

952
00:59:20.602 --> 00:59:22.479
(door banging)

953
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.397
(lock latching)

954
00:59:24.439 --> 00:59:29.152
(banging on glass)
Eat you fucking food

955
00:59:29.194 --> 00:59:31.654
(door creaking)

956
00:59:35.325 --> 00:59:38.036
(mid tempo music)

957
01:00:11.945 --> 01:00:16.449
* I think to myself. I wonder

958
01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:20.787
* How much can she take

959
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:25.417
* It's getting high now under

960
01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:29.295
* I'm drowning in this

961
01:00:29.337 --> 01:00:31.798
(ominous music)

962
01:00:38.555 --> 01:00:41.683
(locks clanking)

963
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.689
(door creaking)

964
01:01:03.413 --> 01:01:04.789
Okay. wait look.

965
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.252
I wanna make a deal with you.

966
01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:12.714
You want me doped up

967
01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.424
because it's easier to
control me that way.

968
01:01:14.466 --> 01:01:15.842
I. I get that.

969
01:01:18.428 --> 01:01:21.139
What if I promise to be good?

970
01:01:21.181 --> 01:01:22.932
Okay?

971
01:01:22.974 --> 01:01:27.187
No screaming. no
violent attacks. no banging on the walls.

972
01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.359
What do you want?

973
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.443
I'm hungry.

974
01:01:35.195 --> 01:01:38.865
I just want to eat
without being drugged.

975
01:01:40.241 --> 01:01:42.202
And I don't. I don't want
that dog bowl either.

976
01:01:42.243 --> 01:01:43.828
It's demeaning.

977
01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:45.205
I know that's the
point of it all.

978
01:01:45.246 --> 01:01:48.083
But I don't want
to eat out of it.

979
01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:52.754
And if I don't eat. I
will look malnourished.

980
01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.220
You need me healthy. Donald.

981
01:02:00.261 --> 01:02:01.346
in order for your artwork

982
01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:04.432
to look as good as
you want it to look.

983
01:02:05.975 --> 01:02:07.852
you need me healthy.

984
01:02:10.689 --> 01:02:13.316
(Donald sighs)

985
01:02:26.788 --> 01:02:28.581
(door creaking)

986
01:02:28.623 --> 01:02:30.250
(door slamming)

987
01:02:30.291 --> 01:02:32.877
(locks clanking)

988
01:02:59.195 --> 01:03:01.948
(locks clanking)

989
01:03:03.241 --> 01:03:05.994
(door creaking)

990
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:18.923
Thank you.

991
01:03:22.552 --> 01:03:25.513
(paper bag rustling)

992
01:03:27.849 --> 01:03:31.186
(door creaking)

993
01:03:31.227 --> 01:03:33.855
(lock clanking)

994
01:03:39.527 --> 01:03:42.238
(ominous music)

995
01:03:54.501 --> 01:03:56.961
Somethings wrong.

996
01:03:57.003 --> 01:03:59.422
We've been watching Iris
Jones for months and nothing.

997
01:03:59.464 --> 01:04:01.174
If she's not at work.
she's with her friends.

998
01:04:01.216 --> 01:04:04.135
If she's not with her
friends. she's alone.

999
01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:07.347
I mean. there's been no
burglar. no gentleman caller.

1000
01:04:07.389 --> 01:04:10.558
- She pretty much
lives a regular life doing regular things.

1001
01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.019
- I'm letting my
wife down Revis.

1002
01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:16.272
- Maybe. maybe the DGK
is just buying time.

1003
01:04:16.314 --> 01:04:17.482
No. no. no.

1004
01:04:17.524 --> 01:04:20.735
He is not going to
just sit by and wait.

1005
01:04:20.777 --> 01:04:22.362
As soon as he finds my
wife's doppelganger.

1006
01:04:22.404 --> 01:04:23.905
they're both gonna die.

1007
01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:26.032
- Then we just continue
watching Iris Jones

1008
01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:28.076
until the DGK finds her.

1009
01:04:31.788 --> 01:04:33.540
- What if she's not
the doppelganger?

1010
01:04:33.581 --> 01:04:36.209
- What. what are you talking
about. what if she's not?

1011
01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:41.923
She looks exactly like your
wife. you even said it yourself.

1012
01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:45.093
(folder snapping)

1013
01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:49.014
Holy shit.

1014
01:04:50.765 --> 01:04:52.100
[Revis] What?

1015
01:04:54.019 --> 01:04:56.354
- Every time we look at
this board. what do we see?

1016
01:04:56.396 --> 01:04:57.480
We see the victims.

1017
01:04:57.522 --> 01:04:58.732
We see the art.

1018
01:04:58.773 --> 01:05:00.483
but we never see the names.

1019
01:05:00.525 --> 01:05:01.609
- Why would we be
looking at the names?

1020
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:02.902
We already know their names.

1021
01:05:02.944 --> 01:05:05.071
- The names are the
bread crumbs. Revis.

1022
01:05:05.113 --> 01:05:07.407
Look at Paislee Parks.

1023
01:05:07.449 --> 01:05:09.451
How weird is it to spell
Paislee with two E's

1024
01:05:09.492 --> 01:05:11.077
as opposed to E. Y?

1025
01:05:11.828 --> 01:05:13.872
Janelle Jameson. Two L's.

1026
01:05:13.913 --> 01:05:15.040
Lonny Lewis. Two N's.

1027
01:05:15.081 --> 01:05:16.833
Terrel Thomas. Two Rs.

1028
01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:20.420
Greenleaf Garrison.
Two E's. two R's.

1029
01:05:20.462 --> 01:05:21.755
And now my wife.

1030
01:05:21.796 --> 01:05:23.340
Blessings Rollins.

1031
01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:24.466
Two S's.

1032
01:05:24.507 --> 01:05:26.301
Two L's.
(whooshing)

1033
01:05:26.343 --> 01:05:28.386
- So we not only looking
for a doppelganger.

1034
01:05:28.428 --> 01:05:29.929
we're also looking
for a doppelganger

1035
01:05:29.971 --> 01:05:31.806
with double letters in her name.

1036
01:05:31.848 --> 01:05:33.350
Exactly.

1037
01:05:33.391 --> 01:05:34.434
(Revis whistling)

1038
01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:37.103
(gentle music)

1039
01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.358
Is everything okay?

1040
01:05:41.399 --> 01:05:43.318
* Ooh

1041
01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.236
* Ooh

1042
01:05:45.278 --> 01:05:47.364
* Ooh

1043
01:05:47.405 --> 01:05:51.826
* Ooh

1044
01:05:51.868 --> 01:05:54.871
* I can't get rid
of this feeling.

1045
01:05:54.913 --> 01:05:56.915
* I'm sitting here

1046
01:05:56.956 --> 01:05:59.918
* You're laying there

1047
01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:03.713
* Our bodies are
matched in a rhythm

1048
01:06:03.755 --> 01:06:05.799
* Might be some high

1049
01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.010
* Love's thick in the air

1050
01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:11.680
* Your scent is
so intoxicating

1051
01:06:11.721 --> 01:06:13.139
Thank you.

1052
01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:17.852
* Your eyes and mind
I could gaze in

1053
01:06:17.894 --> 01:06:22.691
* Your touch is
so amazing. yeah

1054
01:06:26.027 --> 01:06:29.656
* I'm losing my mind and
it's because of you

1055
01:06:29.698 --> 01:06:34.703
* You got me losing my mind
and it's because of you

1056
01:06:36.204 --> 01:06:36.746
* I'm feeling so high and
it's because of you.

1057
01:06:36.788 --> 01:06:37.706
I love you.

1058
01:06:38.873 --> 01:06:42.002
I don't think I said it enough.

1059
01:06:42.043 --> 01:06:43.837
I know you love me.

1060
01:06:43.878 --> 01:06:45.213
* I am going insane

1061
01:06:45.255 --> 01:06:47.674
* Your love has
me going insane

1062
01:06:47.716 --> 01:06:49.092
Now. find me.

1063
01:06:49.134 --> 01:06:54.097
(gentle music)
(clock ticking)

1064
01:07:01.896 --> 01:07:02.772
- What did he do for a living?
- Iceberg.

1065
01:07:02.814 --> 01:07:04.691
Look at this. man.

1066
01:07:04.733 --> 01:07:05.525
What am I looking at?

1067
01:07:05.567 --> 01:07:06.651
The rocker.

1068
01:07:06.693 --> 01:07:08.695
She looks just like your wife.

1069
01:07:08.737 --> 01:07:09.696
No. she is nothing

1070
01:07:09.738 --> 01:07:10.530
- like my wife.
- I didn't say

1071
01:07:10.572 --> 01:07:11.823
she is like your wife.

1072
01:07:11.865 --> 01:07:14.409
I said. she looks
like your wife.

1073
01:07:15.785 --> 01:07:18.371
Now look at the name.

1074
01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:19.581
Jaleece. geez.

1075
01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:22.375
* Locked and loaded

1076
01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:24.044
* Let me come play with
them before I explode it

1077
01:07:24.085 --> 01:07:26.296
* All over the place
and all over the room

1078
01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:28.798
(police siren whirring)
* All the ladies with

1079
01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:29.758
* It hurts

1080
01:07:29.799 --> 01:07:31.051
* When I hit the door.

1081
01:07:31.092 --> 01:07:32.135
* Salute a true Diva

1082
01:07:32.177 --> 01:07:32.969
* When I cross the floor

1083
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:34.346
* All right rest

1084
01:07:34.387 --> 01:07:36.097
* Gotta a red bottoms on

1085
01:07:36.139 --> 01:07:38.183
* At ease all here
plus the Rose is home

1086
01:07:38.224 --> 01:07:39.684
* Been running all week

1087
01:07:39.726 --> 01:07:42.062
* Waiting for a moment
to get in these streets

1088
01:07:42.103 --> 01:07:44.898
* Four months later
it's my time watch me

1089
01:07:44.939 --> 01:07:47.901
* As I move my feet

1090
01:07:47.942 --> 01:07:49.069
* Feel the rhythm and weep

1091
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.570
* Ignite assignment

1092
01:07:50.612 --> 01:07:53.907
* This night will be atomic
pleasure. weak until we leave

1093
01:07:53.948 --> 01:07:56.910
* Careful now as we release

1094
01:07:56.951 --> 01:07:58.495
* Bombshells

1095
01:07:58.536 --> 01:08:00.663
* Wonder how we keep
'em here so well

1096
01:08:00.705 --> 01:08:03.083
* Guaranteed to make
every heart swell

1097
01:08:03.124 --> 01:08:04.751
* Break him till
the knees weak

1098
01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:06.628
* Have him begging for help

1099
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.254
* Bombshells

1100
01:08:08.296 --> 01:08:10.423
* It's the best
place you ever felt

1101
01:08:10.465 --> 01:08:13.093
* So hot it make any man melt

1102
01:08:13.134 --> 01:08:15.261
* He'll never want
anything else

1103
01:08:15.303 --> 01:08:16.680
* But bombshells

1104
01:08:16.721 --> 01:08:19.349
(ominous music)

1105
01:08:37.117 --> 01:08:38.326
* Area

1106
01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:40.453
* Bombshells they
busting out everywhere

1107
01:08:40.495 --> 01:08:41.955
* I can't
* I keep on playing myself

1108
01:08:41.996 --> 01:08:42.789
* I can't
* I keep on playing myself

1109
01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:44.290
* Bombshells

1110
01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:46.459
* Wonder how we keep
him here so well

1111
01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:48.962
* Guaranteed to make
every heart swell

1112
01:08:49.004 --> 01:08:50.422
* Break until the knees weak

1113
01:08:50.463 --> 01:08:52.173
* Have him begging for help

1114
01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:55.135
* Bombshells

1115
01:08:55.176 --> 01:08:56.636
Is she in there?

1116
01:08:56.678 --> 01:08:57.804
Yeah. she's in there.

1117
01:08:57.846 --> 01:08:59.848
What about our suspect. DGK?

1118
01:08:59.889 --> 01:09:01.766
I don't think so.

1119
01:09:01.808 --> 01:09:03.518
- Listen up everybody. I
want you to spread out.

1120
01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.980
Check the area. make sure this
guy does not have eyes on us.

1121
01:09:07.022 --> 01:09:08.273
I want a protective detail

1122
01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:10.567
on this artist
Jaleece at all times.

1123
01:09:10.608 --> 01:09:11.234
Do you understand?

1124
01:09:11.276 --> 01:09:12.152
[Agents] Yes. sir.

1125
01:09:12.193 --> 01:09:13.820
All right. Let's move out.

1126
01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:16.614
(dramatic music)

1127
01:09:19.159 --> 01:09:21.036
Man. do you ever sleep. man?

1128
01:09:21.077 --> 01:09:22.829
Revis. good. you're here.

1129
01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:23.955
Look at this.

1130
01:09:26.416 --> 01:09:28.168
DGK er. has a twin.

1131
01:09:28.209 --> 01:09:31.379
Yeah. I've been
saying this all along.

1132
01:09:34.049 --> 01:09:35.550
No. the boys in that photo.

1133
01:09:35.592 --> 01:09:39.846
they were born on the same
day. but they're not twins.

1134
01:09:39.888 --> 01:09:41.598
I don't understand.

1135
01:09:43.725 --> 01:09:46.019
Irene and Jim Keller.

1136
01:09:46.061 --> 01:09:49.189
They had a baby
boy. but not twins.

1137
01:09:49.230 --> 01:09:50.315
Look at this.

1138
01:09:53.943 --> 01:09:56.279
Okay. now look at this one.

1139
01:10:01.242 --> 01:10:03.536
On the far right.
that's Irene Keller.

1140
01:10:03.578 --> 01:10:07.791
next to her. that's Jim
Keller. Donald Keller's father.

1141
01:10:07.832 --> 01:10:10.460
None of the people on
that photo are twins.

1142
01:10:10.502 --> 01:10:11.878
They're doppelgangers.

1143
01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.088
Exactly.

1144
01:10:13.129 --> 01:10:14.381
We need to go back
to Donald's apartment

1145
01:10:14.422 --> 01:10:15.423
and find out what
was in that room

1146
01:10:15.465 --> 01:10:17.008
we weren't allowed
to enter before.

1147
01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:21.846
(indistinct chatter)
(gentle music)

1148
01:10:24.849 --> 01:10:25.892
(dramatic music)

1149
01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:27.310
Oh shit. what the?

1150
01:10:27.352 --> 01:10:28.603
Oh my goodness.

1151
01:11:02.804 --> 01:11:04.472
(door banging)

1152
01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:08.309
(dramatic music continues)

1153
01:11:23.408 --> 01:11:25.744
FBI. get back in the car!

1154
01:11:32.917 --> 01:11:35.503
(gun cocking)

1155
01:11:36.963 --> 01:11:40.342
(foot crashing on door)

1156
01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:42.469
[Agent 1] Clear.

1157
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:43.303
- Clear.
- Clear.

1158
01:11:43.345 --> 01:11:44.846
[Agent 2] Clear.

1159
01:11:45.847 --> 01:11:47.265
All clear.

1160
01:11:47.307 --> 01:11:48.350
Damn.

1161
01:11:49.225 --> 01:11:52.562
All right. let's get
forensics in here.

1162
01:12:04.032 --> 01:12:05.241
Every nook and cranny.

1163
01:12:05.283 --> 01:12:06.910
Don't miss a thing.

1164
01:12:06.951 --> 01:12:08.244
Yes. sir.

1165
01:12:08.286 --> 01:12:09.245
I Got the closet.

1166
01:12:09.287 --> 01:12:10.205
And I got the door.

1167
01:12:10.246 --> 01:12:11.498
Got some prints over here.

1168
01:12:11.539 --> 01:12:13.458
Uh. let me see those.

1169
01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:17.170
Iceberg.

1170
01:12:17.212 --> 01:12:18.463
[Man 4] Ah fantastic.

1171
01:12:18.505 --> 01:12:20.465
What you got there?

1172
01:12:44.572 --> 01:12:48.410
- He has files on every
one of his victims.

1173
01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.204
Hmm.

1174
01:12:51.246 --> 01:12:52.831
Including your wife.

1175
01:12:56.001 --> 01:12:56.793
Iceberg.

1176
01:13:04.676 --> 01:13:06.886
All right. stop right there.

1177
01:13:06.928 --> 01:13:08.471
Now look around.

1178
01:13:10.932 --> 01:13:12.767
See. what he does

1179
01:13:12.809 --> 01:13:17.188
is he actually draws out the
murder scene before it happens.

1180
01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:18.773
Now look at this one.

1181
01:13:20.108 --> 01:13:21.276
- That's the only one
that hasn't happened yet.

1182
01:13:21.317 --> 01:13:23.153
Exactly.

1183
01:13:23.194 --> 01:13:24.571
See what he's gonna do here?

1184
01:13:24.612 --> 01:13:27.741
He's gonna kill four
people at one time.

1185
01:13:27.782 --> 01:13:31.536
and he's gonna do it in
front of an audience.

1186
01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:34.247
[Iceberg] Good work.

1187
01:13:34.289 --> 01:13:37.459
(door latch clanking)

1188
01:13:41.921 --> 01:13:45.133
(door creaking)

1189
01:13:45.175 --> 01:13:46.509
You're a twin?

1190
01:13:49.137 --> 01:13:50.013
No.

1191
01:13:51.306 --> 01:13:52.307
- You obviously
have a fascination

1192
01:13:52.349 --> 01:13:54.768
for people that look alike.

1193
01:13:54.809 --> 01:13:57.103
If you're not a twin.
where did that come from?

1194
01:13:57.145 --> 01:13:59.522
(Donald sighs)

1195
01:14:02.817 --> 01:14:05.904
- My father had a
twin growing up.

1196
01:14:05.945 --> 01:14:10.367
I mean. they were not the
same mother or father.

1197
01:14:10.408 --> 01:14:12.452
different mother.
different father.

1198
01:14:12.494 --> 01:14:14.954
But they were really identical.

1199
01:14:14.996 --> 01:14:16.122
They talked alike.

1200
01:14:16.164 --> 01:14:17.624
They walked alike.

1201
01:14:17.665 --> 01:14:19.209
They smiled. alike.

1202
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:21.211
They even dressed alike.

1203
01:14:22.504 --> 01:14:24.756
Many people from Kaduna.
where they were from

1204
01:14:24.798 --> 01:14:28.343
really thought they were twins.

1205
01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:30.387
(plastic container rustling)

1206
01:14:30.428 --> 01:14:31.221
Oh.

1207
01:14:34.641 --> 01:14:40.146
After high school. my father
and his best friend decided to.

1208
01:14:40.188 --> 01:14:41.773
they got an admission

1209
01:14:41.815 --> 01:14:44.818
into the Temple University
in Philadelphia.

1210
01:14:44.859 --> 01:14:48.029
So they both moved to America.

1211
01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:50.323
After one year in college.

1212
01:14:50.365 --> 01:14:53.535
they met my mother
and her friend.

1213
01:14:53.576 --> 01:14:56.913
who looked exactly
like identical twins.

1214
01:14:58.707 --> 01:15:02.002
but different father.
different mother.

1215
01:15:02.043 --> 01:15:05.171
And my father started
dating my mother

1216
01:15:06.881 --> 01:15:10.719
and my father's friend started
dating my mother's friend.

1217
01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:13.388
And since then. all of them.

1218
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:16.683
all four of them
became so inseparable.

1219
01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.479
After college my father
married my mother.

1220
01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:22.689
Double wedding?

1221
01:15:22.731 --> 01:15:24.232
Yeah. of course.

1222
01:15:25.692 --> 01:15:28.570
All four of them moved to Texas

1223
01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:32.907
where they would have
nothing but land.

1224
01:15:32.949 --> 01:15:33.783
Mm.

1225
01:15:35.243 --> 01:15:36.369
They wanted their privacy.

1226
01:15:36.411 --> 01:15:37.245
Mm.

1227
01:15:41.416 --> 01:15:43.668
A year after they married.

1228
01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:47.672
my father and mother got me

1229
01:15:47.714 --> 01:15:52.052
and my father's friend
and my mother's friend

1230
01:15:52.093 --> 01:15:54.220
had a baby boy also.

1231
01:15:54.262 --> 01:15:55.305
Same day?

1232
01:15:55.347 --> 01:15:56.681
Yes. same day.

1233
01:15:58.266 --> 01:15:59.517
Did you look alike?

1234
01:15:59.559 --> 01:16:03.021
- Mm. no.
(Donald laughing)

1235
01:16:03.063 --> 01:16:04.230
No.

1236
01:16:04.272 --> 01:16:06.107
We looked nothing alike.

1237
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.611
but our parents were determined

1238
01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:12.238
to make us something
we were not.

1239
01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:15.658
Twins.

1240
01:16:19.496 --> 01:16:21.790
Everything he had. I had.

1241
01:16:23.375 --> 01:16:25.627
Everything he did I did.

1242
01:16:27.962 --> 01:16:32.759
- [Blessing] So you got used
to seeing two of everything.

1243
01:16:37.305 --> 01:16:38.181
Yes.

1244
01:16:39.307 --> 01:16:41.393
What was his name?

1245
01:16:41.434 --> 01:16:42.894
Take a wild guess.

1246
01:16:44.729 --> 01:16:49.651
- Ronald.
(Donald and Blessing laughing)

1247
01:16:53.405 --> 01:16:55.573
Typical. right?

1248
01:16:55.615 --> 01:16:58.618
Ronald and Donald (laughing).

1249
01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:03.373
- Oh my god. I remember
our last birthday party.

1250
01:17:03.415 --> 01:17:05.458
It was so much fun.

1251
01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:08.545
My parents were
huge football fans.

1252
01:17:08.586 --> 01:17:10.088
Football as in soccer. right?

1253
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.172
Nah.

1254
01:17:11.214 --> 01:17:12.465
American football.

1255
01:17:12.507 --> 01:17:13.633
- Mm
- Yeah.

1256
01:17:13.675 --> 01:17:15.969
My father and his best friend

1257
01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:20.432
had followed this American
footballer who was from Nigeria.

1258
01:17:20.473 --> 01:17:23.059
His name was Christian Okoye.

1259
01:17:23.101 --> 01:17:26.146
He was also known as
a Nigerian nightmare.

1260
01:17:26.187 --> 01:17:30.525
And on this particular day.
the same day as our birthday.

1261
01:17:30.567 --> 01:17:32.068
there was a game.

1262
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:35.989
The Philadelphia Eagles were
playing the Atlanta Falcons.

1263
01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:38.658
So my father and his
doppelganger from Philadelphia.

1264
01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:41.703
and my mother and her
doppelganger from Atlanta.

1265
01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:43.830
So they both wore their jerseys.

1266
01:17:43.872 --> 01:17:46.332
There was so much
screaming (laughing).

1267
01:17:46.374 --> 01:17:48.168
so much shouting.

1268
01:17:48.209 --> 01:17:49.627
Wow.

1269
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:52.130
It was so amazing
to watch a game

1270
01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.675
while celebrating our birthday.

1271
01:17:55.717 --> 01:17:56.760
- Mm.
- Ah.

1272
01:17:57.552 --> 01:17:58.678
You felt good about that. huh?

1273
01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.180
Yeah.

1274
01:18:00.221 --> 01:18:00.847
Yeah. I liked it.

1275
01:18:00.889 --> 01:18:02.349
I really liked it.

1276
01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:06.061
- How old were you
turning at the time?

1277
01:18:06.102 --> 01:18:09.689
- We. we were just just
turning seven that day.

1278
01:18:09.731 --> 01:18:11.358
- Were there a lot of
kids at your party?

1279
01:18:11.399 --> 01:18:14.194
Nah (sighing).

1280
01:18:15.737 --> 01:18:18.531
Our parents were
very private people.

1281
01:18:18.573 --> 01:18:21.368
They never really liked to
have a lot of people around us.

1282
01:18:21.409 --> 01:18:24.245
So. (laughs).

1283
01:18:24.287 --> 01:18:26.039
Anyways. on that night.

1284
01:18:27.415 --> 01:18:32.504
my parents put me to bed and
Ronald's parents went home.

1285
01:18:32.545 --> 01:18:33.463
So I waited.

1286
01:18:35.382 --> 01:18:36.883
Waited for what?

1287
01:18:36.925 --> 01:18:40.470
- My parents and Ronald's
parents used to do stuff

1288
01:18:40.512 --> 01:18:43.598
downstairs in the living room.

1289
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:46.101
[Blessing] Stuff Like what?

1290
01:18:47.102 --> 01:18:48.520
Drugs.

1291
01:18:48.561 --> 01:18:49.396
parties.

1292
01:18:50.355 --> 01:18:51.272
sex.

1293
01:18:52.065 --> 01:18:53.900
My dad kissing Ronald's dad.

1294
01:18:53.942 --> 01:18:56.277
My mom kissing Ronald's mom.

1295
01:18:58.405 --> 01:18:59.572
And on this fateful night.

1296
01:18:59.614 --> 01:19:01.700
I knew they were
gonna be doing stuff.

1297
01:19:01.741 --> 01:19:05.787
So I snuck out of my
bedroom and I went to watch.

1298
01:19:06.996 --> 01:19:09.749
- [Blessing] What
were they doing?

1299
01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:12.293
They were talking.

1300
01:19:12.335 --> 01:19:14.129
[Blessing] About what?

1301
01:19:14.963 --> 01:19:18.800
(plastic container rustling)

1302
01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:22.429
They wanted more children.

1303
01:19:23.972 --> 01:19:27.434
but they wanted them to look
more like Ronald's parents

1304
01:19:27.475 --> 01:19:29.811
and nothing like me or Ronald.

1305
01:19:32.188 --> 01:19:36.526
They. they wanted to get rid
of us and start all over.

1306
01:19:40.864 --> 01:19:44.117
- [Blessing] Get.
get rid of you. how?

1307
01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:47.620
- They were gonna kill us
that night in our sleep

1308
01:19:47.662 --> 01:19:49.998
and bury our bodies
in the woods.

1309
01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:53.793
So it seems like we
never even existed.

1310
01:19:53.835 --> 01:19:56.463
[Blessing] Oh my God.

1311
01:19:56.504 --> 01:19:57.839
What did you do?

1312
01:20:03.762 --> 01:20:07.974
- I snuck out of the
window in my bedroom.

1313
01:20:08.016 --> 01:20:09.351
I went to Ronald's bedroom.

1314
01:20:09.392 --> 01:20:10.852
I tried to warn him.

1315
01:20:13.104 --> 01:20:15.607
There was just so much blood.

1316
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.361
So much blood everywhere.

1317
01:20:22.572 --> 01:20:24.949
His father was stabbing him.

1318
01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:27.952
He was crying.

1319
01:20:29.496 --> 01:20:33.917
He was screaming. begging
for his mom to help him.

1320
01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.881
but she never came.

1321
01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:45.261
He was just a boy.

1322
01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:54.646
Anyway. that was the last time
I saw Ronald or my parents.

1323
01:20:58.358 --> 01:21:03.822
- [Blessing] So that's why you
hate people who look alike.

1324
01:21:03.863 --> 01:21:04.364
Yeah.

1325
01:21:05.115 --> 01:21:08.243
(car engine roaring)

1326
01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:15.250
(upbeat music)

1327
01:21:24.926 --> 01:21:27.721
* I got my fly
dress on tonight.

1328
01:21:27.762 --> 01:21:29.055
* Waiting on your text

1329
01:21:29.097 --> 01:21:31.725
* I bet you're gonna sweat

1330
01:21:31.766 --> 01:21:38.064
* Kiss me on my neck
when we connect at six you won't regret

1331
01:21:38.106 --> 01:21:41.234
* I just can't wait
to get to you

1332
01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:44.404
* Cause we're gonna
see if you like me

1333
01:21:44.446 --> 01:21:47.073
* Like I like you.
baby here's a clue

1334
01:21:47.115 --> 01:21:52.746
* I want you to hurry to me

1335
01:21:52.787 --> 01:21:54.789
* Give me what cha got

1336
01:21:54.831 --> 01:21:57.917
* I got what you need

1337
01:21:57.959 --> 01:22:01.254
- I've seen you before.
* Give me what cha got

1338
01:22:01.296 --> 01:22:05.050
- * I got what you need
- I like to watch you sing

1339
01:22:05.091 --> 01:22:06.551
* Give me what cha got

1340
01:22:06.593 --> 01:22:08.178
Are you hear with anyone?

1341
01:22:08.219 --> 01:22:11.014
- *I got what you need
- No I came here for you

1342
01:22:11.056 --> 01:22:14.142
- * I'm about to make you mine
- Good.

1343
01:22:14.184 --> 01:22:16.353
Cause I am not willing
to play any game. yeah.

1344
01:22:16.394 --> 01:22:18.938
I like to get to what
I want straight away.

1345
01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.231
What do you want?

1346
01:22:20.273 --> 01:22:25.820
* You got no clue what
I wanna do. please you

1347
01:22:25.862 --> 01:22:28.656
* Give me what cha got

1348
01:22:28.698 --> 01:22:31.868
* I got what you need

1349
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:34.621
* Give me what cha got

1350
01:22:34.662 --> 01:22:37.999
* I got what you need

1351
01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:41.127
* I'm about to make you mine

1352
01:22:41.169 --> 01:22:44.130
* I'm yours for life

1353
01:22:44.172 --> 01:22:47.175
(crickets chirping)

1354
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:51.680
(lips smacking)

1355
01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:56.142
Baby. I missed you so much.

1356
01:22:56.184 --> 01:22:59.229
- I know. I know.
I missed you too.

1357
01:23:00.188 --> 01:23:02.607
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

1358
01:23:02.649 --> 01:23:03.483
I'm sorry.

1359
01:23:03.525 --> 01:23:04.359
I'm sorry.

1360
01:23:06.695 --> 01:23:07.821
Where are you Going?

1361
01:23:07.862 --> 01:23:09.781
You can't leave me out here.

1362
01:23:09.823 --> 01:23:11.366
Are you bloody mad?

1363
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:26.256
(door clicking)

1364
01:23:26.297 --> 01:23:27.882
- I'm looking for
Special Agent Revis.

1365
01:23:27.924 --> 01:23:29.592
I was told he might be here.

1366
01:23:29.634 --> 01:23:30.635
He's here.

1367
01:23:30.677 --> 01:23:32.262
Is he expecting you?

1368
01:23:32.303 --> 01:23:34.514
- Um. no ma'am.
he's not. I just.

1369
01:23:34.556 --> 01:23:36.182
Wait a minute.

1370
01:23:36.224 --> 01:23:38.727
You're that news reporter.

1371
01:23:38.768 --> 01:23:40.520
Iceberg.

1372
01:23:40.562 --> 01:23:41.980
What's up. man?

1373
01:23:42.022 --> 01:23:44.190
Uh. you got some
information on the new case?

1374
01:23:44.232 --> 01:23:48.028
No. I just (sighs)

1375
01:23:48.069 --> 01:23:51.072
I keep seeing her
everywhere I turn.

1376
01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.366
- We were just about
to have dinner.

1377
01:23:53.408 --> 01:23:56.578
Would you like to come inside?

1378
01:23:56.619 --> 01:23:57.537
[Iceberg] Sure.

1379
01:23:57.579 --> 01:23:58.413
Come on.

1380
01:24:08.048 --> 01:24:11.926
- Uh. is this how
y'all normally eat?

1381
01:24:11.968 --> 01:24:14.304
All the time.

1382
01:24:14.346 --> 01:24:15.597
- Yeah. I don't think I
should be witnessing this.

1383
01:24:15.638 --> 01:24:16.806
I'm gonna go.

1384
01:24:16.848 --> 01:24:18.933
No. no. don't leave.

1385
01:24:18.975 --> 01:24:21.644
I have so many more questions.

1386
01:24:21.686 --> 01:24:23.188
About what. the case?

1387
01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:25.565
About your partner.

1388
01:24:25.607 --> 01:24:29.486
You see. I think he's the
most loving. loyal. playful.

1389
01:24:29.527 --> 01:24:33.239
yet wise and mature
man I have ever met.

1390
01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:35.283
And I want to know
what you think.

1391
01:24:35.325 --> 01:24:36.159
Why?

1392
01:24:37.285 --> 01:24:38.536
Because I'm afraid

1393
01:24:38.578 --> 01:24:41.623
that this is all just
some type of mirage.

1394
01:24:49.214 --> 01:24:52.258
- Damn Iceberg. you aint got
no. no words to say about me?

1395
01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:53.718
I think the world of you. man.

1396
01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.386
He does.

1397
01:24:56.763 --> 01:24:59.099
- Honestly Revis. all I
can think about is my wife

1398
01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:01.184
and whatever it is she's
going through right now.

1399
01:25:01.226 --> 01:25:03.395
Do you think about death?

1400
01:25:03.436 --> 01:25:04.562
Death?

1401
01:25:04.604 --> 01:25:05.522
Like her death?

1402
01:25:05.563 --> 01:25:06.231
No.

1403
01:25:06.272 --> 01:25:08.400
Like what if you die?

1404
01:25:08.441 --> 01:25:10.485
You see most people when
they think about love.

1405
01:25:10.527 --> 01:25:13.321
they think about today on Earth.

1406
01:25:13.363 --> 01:25:18.785
But if you die. who would
you love in the afterlife?

1407
01:25:18.827 --> 01:25:20.620
You see. even in death.

1408
01:25:20.662 --> 01:25:23.164
I believe I would
want to be with him.

1409
01:25:23.206 --> 01:25:26.209
That's how incredible
I think he is.

1410
01:25:26.251 --> 01:25:27.877
- Well I certainly wouldn't
wanna be stuck with him

1411
01:25:27.919 --> 01:25:29.170
in the afterlife?

1412
01:25:31.673 --> 01:25:33.133
All right.

1413
01:25:33.174 --> 01:25:35.260
As far as a man goes.

1414
01:25:35.301 --> 01:25:37.804
I don't think you could
have done any better.

1415
01:25:37.846 --> 01:25:39.848
(Joanne chuckles lightly)

1416
01:25:39.889 --> 01:25:41.182
I'm gonna go.

1417
01:25:44.894 --> 01:25:47.439
(car horn honking)

1418
01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.024
(lips smacking against skin)

1419
01:25:49.065 --> 01:25:50.692
Ooh. whoop whoop.

1420
01:25:51.901 --> 01:25:52.986
(Revis and Joanne chuckling)

1421
01:25:53.028 --> 01:25:54.696
Had to pull you over there.

1422
01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:56.531
You know. why don't you?

1423
01:25:57.741 --> 01:25:58.825
Ass too fat.

1424
01:26:03.955 --> 01:26:06.750
(phone ringing)

1425
01:26:06.791 --> 01:26:09.252
(Revis sighing)

1426
01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:16.092
Iceberg. go ahead.

1427
01:26:16.134 --> 01:26:19.596
- [Iceberg] Donald
Keller was married.

1428
01:26:19.637 --> 01:26:20.764
I'm on my way.

1429
01:26:27.645 --> 01:26:30.607
- I thought you
were on your way.

1430
01:26:30.648 --> 01:26:31.441
I am.

1431
01:26:31.483 --> 01:26:32.901
Mm.

1432
01:26:32.942 --> 01:26:35.695
(dramatic music)

1433
01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:40.950
What's your favorite movie?

1434
01:26:42.035 --> 01:26:43.119
[Iceberg] Excuse me?

1435
01:26:43.161 --> 01:26:44.788
Your favorite movie.

1436
01:26:44.829 --> 01:26:45.538
What is it?

1437
01:26:46.748 --> 01:26:47.624
[Iceberg] Mrs. Fontaine.

1438
01:26:47.665 --> 01:26:48.875
Call me Deborah.

1439
01:26:48.917 --> 01:26:50.794
and I'm not answering
any of your questions

1440
01:26:50.835 --> 01:26:55.048
until you tell me what's
your favorite movie?

1441
01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:56.257
Yep. yes. yes.

1442
01:26:56.299 --> 01:26:57.550
Miss Deborah. ma'am.

1443
01:26:57.592 --> 01:27:00.679
we'll. tell tell you
our favorite movie.

1444
01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.346
Um.

1445
01:27:02.722 --> 01:27:03.932
The Godfather.

1446
01:27:05.767 --> 01:27:07.727
Mm. figures.

1447
01:27:07.769 --> 01:27:12.190
Can't Go wrong with
The Godfather. right?

1448
01:27:12.232 --> 01:27:15.235
- Beauty and the
Breasts. Beasts.

1449
01:27:15.276 --> 01:27:18.863
Beauty and The Beast. some
of Disney's finest work.

1450
01:27:18.905 --> 01:27:19.948
You think so?

1451
01:27:19.989 --> 01:27:21.157
Ab. absolutely.

1452
01:27:21.199 --> 01:27:22.325
Chef's Kiss (smacks lips).

1453
01:27:22.367 --> 01:27:23.410
- Deborah...
- My favorite movie

1454
01:27:23.451 --> 01:27:25.453
is Basic Instinct.

1455
01:27:25.495 --> 01:27:27.872
I watch it every night
before I go to bed.

1456
01:27:27.914 --> 01:27:31.042
I think to myself what it would
be like to be Sharon Stone

1457
01:27:31.084 --> 01:27:32.752
in that situation.

1458
01:27:32.794 --> 01:27:33.920
Mm. you know?

1459
01:27:35.338 --> 01:27:38.925
- Oh. you obsess.
- Oh. my Netflix and chill.

1460
01:27:38.967 --> 01:27:39.884
Nope. mm.

1461
01:27:39.926 --> 01:27:40.927
No thank you.

1462
01:27:40.969 --> 01:27:42.262
(Revis growling)

1463
01:27:42.303 --> 01:27:43.555
[Iceberg] Nope.

1464
01:27:43.596 --> 01:27:44.931
Nope.
(Revis clearing throat)

1465
01:27:44.973 --> 01:27:45.765
No thank you.

1466
01:27:45.807 --> 01:27:47.434
(Deborah giggles)

1467
01:27:47.475 --> 01:27:50.103
- Okay. you can ask
your questions now.

1468
01:27:50.145 --> 01:27:52.105
Donald Keller?

1469
01:27:52.147 --> 01:27:55.108
- My baby girl's
psycho ex-husband?

1470
01:27:55.150 --> 01:27:57.068
- What can you
tell us about him?

1471
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:58.820
I could tell you everything.

1472
01:27:58.862 --> 01:28:01.031
Starting with the fact
that he's a nut job.

1473
01:28:01.072 --> 01:28:02.490
What do you mean?

1474
01:28:02.532 --> 01:28:05.201
- Well. he has to have
two of everything.

1475
01:28:05.243 --> 01:28:07.495
If that wasn't weird enough.

1476
01:28:07.537 --> 01:28:10.582
he had a violent side
like nobody's business.

1477
01:28:10.623 --> 01:28:11.916
- Wait a minute. we
researched this guy.

1478
01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:13.126
He had no history of viol.

1479
01:28:13.168 --> 01:28:15.295
of a violent past.

1480
01:28:15.337 --> 01:28:17.630
- That's because he's
too smart to be obvious.

1481
01:28:17.672 --> 01:28:20.550
And that's what made
him so dangerous.

1482
01:28:20.592 --> 01:28:22.385
I even told her to get a
psychiatrist. you know.

1483
01:28:22.427 --> 01:28:24.179
to help her mentally

1484
01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.598
and a restraining
order out against him.

1485
01:28:26.639 --> 01:28:28.475
That was some good advice.

1486
01:28:28.516 --> 01:28:32.395
- I watched a lot of Dr.
Phil and Oprah that day.

1487
01:28:32.437 --> 01:28:34.397
- So I understand
the psychiatrist.

1488
01:28:34.439 --> 01:28:37.317
but why did you feel a
restraining order was necessary?

1489
01:28:37.359 --> 01:28:38.276
(dramatic music)

1490
01:28:38.318 --> 01:28:39.944
KK was pregnant

1491
01:28:39.986 --> 01:28:42.447
and she was planning
on getting an abortion.

1492
01:28:42.489 --> 01:28:44.115
And we knew if
Donald ever found out

1493
01:28:44.157 --> 01:28:46.451
that he would try to kill her.

1494
01:28:46.493 --> 01:28:48.953
Well. she was determined
to have the abortion.

1495
01:28:48.995 --> 01:28:50.830
so she asked me to look into it.

1496
01:28:50.872 --> 01:28:52.165
I didn't wanna do it.

1497
01:28:52.207 --> 01:28:54.167
I don't even believe
in abortions.

1498
01:28:54.209 --> 01:28:55.919
But KK was so afraid.

1499
01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.587
So I did it.

1500
01:28:57.629 --> 01:29:00.674
And I found a really good
doctor right here in Houston.

1501
01:29:00.715 --> 01:29:03.343
There were some complications
with the surgery.

1502
01:29:03.385 --> 01:29:06.096
And my baby died
with her babies.

1503
01:29:07.931 --> 01:29:09.265
[Iceberg] Babies?

1504
01:29:09.307 --> 01:29:10.892
She was aborting twins.

1505
01:29:10.934 --> 01:29:11.559
Oh shit.

1506
01:29:13.353 --> 01:29:15.355
And you blamed the doctor?

1507
01:29:15.397 --> 01:29:17.857
I blamed the whole system.

1508
01:29:17.899 --> 01:29:19.109
Donald blamed the doctor.

1509
01:29:19.150 --> 01:29:22.487
(dramatic upbeat music)

1510
01:29:26.991 --> 01:29:29.536
(phone ringing)

1511
01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:31.329
Special Agent Sparks.

1512
01:29:31.371 --> 01:29:32.997
How can I help you?

1513
01:29:33.039 --> 01:29:34.791
- [Iceberg] Kamille
Keller. two K. two Ls.

1514
01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:36.543
had an abortion
over ten years ago.

1515
01:29:36.584 --> 01:29:37.752
That was around the same time

1516
01:29:37.794 --> 01:29:39.546
that DGK's first
victim went missing.

1517
01:29:39.587 --> 01:29:41.673
I need to know where she
went to have that abortion

1518
01:29:41.715 --> 01:29:44.050
and who was the doctor
that performed the surgery?

1519
01:29:44.092 --> 01:29:45.385
Is that it?

1520
01:29:45.427 --> 01:29:46.219
[Iceberg] That's it.

1521
01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:47.470
I'm on it.

1522
01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:53.727
(birds chirping)
(car engine humming)

1523
01:30:05.155 --> 01:30:06.364
(car door slamming)

1524
01:30:06.406 --> 01:30:07.741
(fly buzzing)

1525
01:30:07.782 --> 01:30:10.493
(bird squawking)

1526
01:30:18.293 --> 01:30:19.711
You must be our new neighbor.

1527
01:30:19.753 --> 01:30:21.129
Oh. yes.

1528
01:30:21.171 --> 01:30:23.256
- I was wondering who bought
the house across the street.

1529
01:30:23.298 --> 01:30:24.257
I'm Tess.

1530
01:30:24.299 --> 01:30:25.342
Hi Tess.

1531
01:30:25.383 --> 01:30:26.509
I'm Donald.

1532
01:30:27.302 --> 01:30:28.303
Nice to meet you. Donald.

1533
01:30:28.345 --> 01:30:29.429
Welcome to the neighborhood.

1534
01:30:29.471 --> 01:30:30.555
- Thank you.
- You have a nice day.

1535
01:30:30.597 --> 01:30:32.557
You too. now. Tess.

1536
01:30:33.224 --> 01:30:36.561
(car door slams shut)

1537
01:30:36.603 --> 01:30:39.689
(car engine roaring)

1538
01:30:48.615 --> 01:30:51.659
(ominous music)

1539
01:31:18.269 --> 01:31:21.022
(phone ringing)

1540
01:31:22.524 --> 01:31:23.733
[Iceberg] Go.

1541
01:31:23.775 --> 01:31:25.694
Kamille Keller had an abortion

1542
01:31:25.735 --> 01:31:30.156
at the old abortion and
safety house on Old Mill Road.

1543
01:31:30.198 --> 01:31:32.867
The doctor was Todd Sellers

1544
01:31:32.909 --> 01:31:36.329
and he's at 1414 Autobahn
Road. Houston. Texas.

1545
01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:38.873
(upbeat music)

1546
01:31:47.215 --> 01:31:50.677
(police siren wailing)

1547
01:31:51.803 --> 01:31:52.929
Todd!

1548
01:31:52.971 --> 01:31:54.431
I was so worried.

1549
01:31:54.472 --> 01:31:56.349
I found the front door
wide open when I got home

1550
01:31:56.391 --> 01:31:57.434
and you were
nowhere to be found.

1551
01:31:57.475 --> 01:31:59.936
I thought that DGK
guy had got you.

1552
01:31:59.978 --> 01:32:03.189
Why are you dressed
like an FBI agent?

1553
01:32:06.693 --> 01:32:08.862
So you're not my
husband. you're FBI?

1554
01:32:08.903 --> 01:32:09.571
No ma'am.

1555
01:32:09.612 --> 01:32:10.405
I'm not your husband.

1556
01:32:10.447 --> 01:32:12.365
But you look just like him.

1557
01:32:12.407 --> 01:32:14.451
Todd. are you playing with me?

1558
01:32:14.492 --> 01:32:15.702
Are you serious?

1559
01:32:15.744 --> 01:32:17.370
Like I was genuinely
worried about you.

1560
01:32:17.412 --> 01:32:18.788
[Iceberg] Mrs. Sellers.

1561
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:20.665
I assure you that I'm
not joking with you.

1562
01:32:20.707 --> 01:32:23.668
My name is Special
Agent John Rollins.

1563
01:32:26.755 --> 01:32:28.882
Well. special agent.

1564
01:32:28.923 --> 01:32:32.802
Is this my husband or am
I going fucking crazy?

1565
01:32:32.844 --> 01:32:36.181
(man thudding on floor)

1566
01:32:40.977 --> 01:32:43.521
(Donald sighing)

1567
01:32:43.563 --> 01:32:48.777
(door slamming)
(latch clacking)

1568
01:33:00.288 --> 01:33:02.832
(door rattling)

1569
01:33:06.378 --> 01:33:09.089
(door slamming)

1570
01:33:21.309 --> 01:33:23.436
You need something?

1571
01:33:23.478 --> 01:33:24.646
Who is that?

1572
01:33:26.147 --> 01:33:27.732
[Donald] Todd?

1573
01:33:29.025 --> 01:33:32.070
- Why does Todd look
like my husband?

1574
01:33:32.112 --> 01:33:35.198
- Todd Seller. is
a medical doctor

1575
01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.409
who specializes in abortions.

1576
01:33:42.789 --> 01:33:46.626
You see. he has always
been on my list.

1577
01:33:46.668 --> 01:33:49.170
but I just wasn't
ready for him yet.

1578
01:33:49.212 --> 01:33:51.172
I needed to get
you out of the way.

1579
01:33:51.214 --> 01:33:54.676
But then something
miraculously happened.

1580
01:33:54.718 --> 01:33:56.803
I was watching TV

1581
01:33:56.845 --> 01:34:01.182
and I saw your husband
was searching for me.

1582
01:34:01.224 --> 01:34:02.308
(fingers snapping)

1583
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:03.893
And then it clicked.

1584
01:34:03.935 --> 01:34:04.769
Huh?

1585
01:34:12.861 --> 01:34:14.738
Eagles and Falcons.

1586
01:34:17.198 --> 01:34:19.075
Birds of prey.

1587
01:34:19.117 --> 01:34:19.743
Aha.

1588
01:34:22.203 --> 01:34:26.499
- Come on. Dr. Rollins.
I'm sure as a psychologist.

1589
01:34:26.541 --> 01:34:28.501
you must appreciate the synergy

1590
01:34:28.543 --> 01:34:30.712
in this perfect piece of art.

1591
01:34:33.465 --> 01:34:39.304
The women painted like eagles
and men painted like falcons.

1592
01:34:39.346 --> 01:34:41.097
Wow.

1593
01:34:41.139 --> 01:34:42.098
Ha. I love it.

1594
01:34:44.309 --> 01:34:46.227
I even brought you wings.

1595
01:34:48.521 --> 01:34:52.359
(laughing) I am so excited.

1596
01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.028
I can't wait to start.

1597
01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:56.821
You're artistically recreating

1598
01:34:56.863 --> 01:35:00.158
the last birthday party
with your parents?

1599
01:35:04.412 --> 01:35:05.330
Yes.

1600
01:35:07.415 --> 01:35:09.417
So. so this Dr. Todd.

1601
01:35:11.127 --> 01:35:14.172
he was your original
target and not my husband.

1602
01:35:14.214 --> 01:35:15.048
Yeah.

1603
01:35:16.925 --> 01:35:19.094
but you see your husband.

1604
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:25.725
let's call it bad luck or
perfect genes or bad timing.

1605
01:35:25.767 --> 01:35:28.269
He just appeared on my radar.

1606
01:35:29.562 --> 01:35:31.690
They look alike. don't they?

1607
01:35:31.731 --> 01:35:34.025
Okay. so then why am I here?

1608
01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.533
Ten Years ago

1609
01:35:43.118 --> 01:35:48.832
you counseled a certain young
lady. Ms. Kamille Keller.

1610
01:35:48.873 --> 01:35:52.127
and you advised her
to commit an abortion.

1611
01:35:54.546 --> 01:35:56.089
I would never do that though.

1612
01:35:56.131 --> 01:35:57.173
Yes. you did!

1613
01:35:58.758 --> 01:36:01.344
You were her counselor.

1614
01:36:01.386 --> 01:36:02.470
You advised her.

1615
01:36:03.805 --> 01:36:07.225
She took your counsel
and aborted my babies!

1616
01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.438
My.

1617
01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.315

On his abortion table!

1625
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:48.016
She. she was being
abused by her husband.

1626
01:36:48.058 --> 01:36:51.644
(sobbing) That
was you wasn't it?

1627
01:36:51.686 --> 01:36:52.771
She didn't know whether or not

1628
01:36:52.812 --> 01:36:53.980
she wanted to have her babies.

1629
01:36:54.022 --> 01:36:55.857
She. she wasn't in the
right frame of mind.

1630
01:36:55.899 --> 01:36:57.859
but I didn't tell her
to have an abortion.

1631
01:36:57.901 --> 01:37:00.195
- I told her...
- Yes you did!

1632
01:37:01.446 --> 01:37:03.156
What about me?

1633
01:37:03.198 --> 01:37:05.617
Does my choice
not matter at all?

1634
01:37:05.658 --> 01:37:07.911
You weren't my patient.

1635
01:37:35.313 --> 01:37:40.026
- Dr. Blessing. Rollins. you
have been sentenced to death.

1636
01:37:44.572 --> 01:37:49.619
You both must prepare yourself
now for the day of reckoning.

(Jaleece and Blessing sobbing)

1792
01:48:47.318 --> 01:48:49.362
- You knew Donald Keller was
DGK all along didn't you?

1793
01:48:49.404 --> 01:48:50.405
No. I did not.

1794
01:48:50.447 --> 01:48:52.073
He was at your private event.

1795
01:48:52.115 --> 01:48:53.366
With Paislee.

1796
01:48:53.408 --> 01:48:55.201
You showcased his artwork.

1797
01:48:55.243 --> 01:48:56.619
I didn't know it was his.

1798
01:48:56.661 --> 01:48:58.788
Paislee was my friend.
she begged me hang it.

1799
01:48:58.830 --> 01:49:00.290
I would've done
anything for her.

1800
01:49:00.331 --> 01:49:02.500
- And distracting the FBI so
he could grab another victim.

1801
01:49:02.542 --> 01:49:04.210
How do you explain that?

1802
01:49:04.252 --> 01:49:05.420
He was waiting in my gallery.

1803
01:49:05.462 --> 01:49:07.213
I don't know how
he got in there.

1804
01:49:07.255 --> 01:49:08.506
He was in there with Margo May.

1805
01:49:08.548 --> 01:49:09.424
She was sitting in the chair.

1806
01:49:09.466 --> 01:49:11.301
He had a gun to her head.

1807
01:49:11.343 --> 01:49:11.926
Did you see him?

1808
01:49:11.968 --> 01:49:12.761
Yes.

1809
01:49:12.802 --> 01:49:14.763
Is this what you saw?

1810
01:49:18.099 --> 01:49:19.225
That's him.

1811
01:49:19.267 --> 01:49:22.020
(dramatic music)

1812
01:49:48.672 --> 01:49:51.049
- He said we were
gonna play a game.

1813
01:49:51.091 --> 01:49:52.759
If he wins. we live.

1814
01:49:53.718 --> 01:49:55.637
If he loses. she dies.

1815
01:49:56.971 --> 01:49:57.847
What game?

1816
01:49:59.641 --> 01:50:01.851
- I was to go to
Bill's Soul Food Cafe

1817
01:50:01.893 --> 01:50:03.645
and sit in the front row.

1818
01:50:03.687 --> 01:50:05.980
When the band finishes their
final song of the night.

1819
01:50:06.022 --> 01:50:08.441
I was to get up and exit
out of the back door.

1820
01:50:08.483 --> 01:50:10.568
If I see anybody following me.

1821
01:50:10.610 --> 01:50:12.487
I was to take off running.

1822
01:50:12.529 --> 01:50:13.947
There would be a car
waiting out back.

1823
01:50:13.988 --> 01:50:15.156
I was to get in and lay low

1824
01:50:15.198 --> 01:50:17.492
until he called and
told me to drive.

1825
01:50:17.534 --> 01:50:18.660
I was so terrified

1826
01:50:18.702 --> 01:50:21.162
I didn't even see
Margo in the back seat.

1827
01:50:21.204 --> 01:50:23.289
When he finally called. I
didn't even think about it.

1828
01:50:23.331 --> 01:50:24.874
I just took off.

1829
01:50:24.916 --> 01:50:28.253
Until I looked in
the rear view mirror.

1830
01:50:28.294 --> 01:50:29.963
He killed her.

1831
01:50:30.005 --> 01:50:33.383
I did everything he told me to
do and he killed her anyway.

1832
01:50:33.425 --> 01:50:34.968
so I stopped driving.

1833
01:50:36.136 --> 01:50:37.178
(dramatic music)

1834
01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:38.555
And.

1835
01:50:38.596 --> 01:50:40.306
he told me to give
you a message.

1836
01:50:40.348 --> 01:50:41.474
What message?

1837
01:50:41.516 --> 01:50:44.185
It's in my inside coat pocket.

1838
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:59.242
(woman sobbing)
(Donald humming)

1839
01:51:26.394 --> 01:51:28.563
(dramatic music continues)

1840
01:51:28.605 --> 01:51:30.774
You need to stop crying.

1841
01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:34.903
You're going to ruin the art.

1842
01:51:39.324 --> 01:51:40.408
I'm sorry.

1843
01:51:43.161 --> 01:51:44.496
Thank you.

1844
01:51:44.537 --> 01:51:45.830
Special agent John Rollins.

1845
01:51:45.872 --> 01:51:47.749
you're cordially invited
to an art celebration.

1846
01:51:47.791 --> 01:51:51.461
10:00 PM 8805 on Clarke
Road. Lewis. Texas.

1847
01:51:51.503 --> 01:51:54.381
Come alone or your
wife dies. DGK.

1848
01:51:54.422 --> 01:51:55.090
8 8 0 5?

1849
01:51:56.383 --> 01:51:59.719
That's an abandoned abortion
clinic and safe house.

1850
01:51:59.761 --> 01:52:01.680
Yeah. women used
to come to Houston

1851
01:52:01.721 --> 01:52:02.889
and stay at the safe house

1852
01:52:02.931 --> 01:52:05.058
till their number was
called for surgery.

1853
01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:07.519
Back then. you could
make arrangements

1854
01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:09.396
and stay the night
if you wanted to.

1855
01:52:09.437 --> 01:52:11.231
That was Roe v Wade central.

1856
01:52:11.272 --> 01:52:14.818
large crowds would come and
riot. picket. foul language.

1857
01:52:14.859 --> 01:52:16.569
It was crazy.

1858
01:52:16.611 --> 01:52:18.905
A few years ago someone
bought that property

1859
01:52:18.947 --> 01:52:20.323
and now it's just empty.

1860
01:52:20.365 --> 01:52:21.825
It's just there.

1861
01:52:21.866 --> 01:52:23.702
DGK is there.

1862
01:52:23.743 --> 01:52:24.411
- I'll alert the team.
- Good.

1863
01:52:24.452 --> 01:52:25.912
You alert the team.

1864
01:52:25.954 --> 01:52:26.538
I'm gonna go find my wife.
(hand banging on desk)

1865
01:52:26.579 --> 01:52:28.248
(sirens wailing)

1866
01:52:28.289 --> 01:52:31.042
(dramatic music)

1867
01:52:40.844 --> 01:52:43.930
(crickets chirping)

1868
01:52:47.684 --> 01:52:50.437
[Crowd] DGK. DGK. DGK. DGK. DGK.

1869
01:52:55.483 --> 01:52:59.112

01:52:59.154 --> 01:53:01.823
(sirens wailing)

1871
01:53:07.328 --> 01:53:10.582
(car door slamming shut)

1872
01:53:11.791 --> 01:53:13.335
[Crowd] DGK. DGK.

1873
01:53:13.376 --> 01:53:14.544

[Crowd] Whoa!

1887
01:53:34.773 --> 01:53:37.525
(crowd cheering)

1888
01:53:45.533 --> 01:53:48.912
(dramatic whooshing)

1889
01:53:48.953 --> 01:53:52.957
- Welcome. welcome.
ladies and gentlemen.

1890
01:53:52.999 --> 01:53:54.876
I am your host. DGK!

1891

- Agent Rollins.

1896

01:54:12.018 --> 01:54:13.937
DGK. DGK. DGK!

1898
01:54:13.978 --> 01:54:16.064

1902
01:54:23.571 --> 01:54:27.826

[Crowd] Whoa!

1907
01:54:43.049 --> 01:54:44.217
[Crowd] Wow!

DGK!

1914
01:55:07.449 --> 01:55:08.783

DGK!

1920
01:55:17.625 --> 01:55:18.752
Move

1921
01:55:18.793 --> 01:55:19.627
Move

1922
01:55:20.712 --> 01:55:23.631
(people screaming)

1923
01:55:31.556 --> 01:55:34.476
(Donald groaning)

1924
01:55:35.852 --> 01:55:37.395
[Crowd] DGK!

1925
01:55:37.437 --> 01:55:38.772
DGK!

1926
01:55:38.813 --> 01:55:41.566
(dramatic music)

1927
01:55:49.741 --> 01:55:52.619
(car door slamming)

1928
01:55:56.706 --> 01:55:58.667
Ladies and gentlemen.

1929
01:55:59.834 --> 01:56:02.003
Are you enjoying the show?

1930
01:56:02.045 --> 01:56:05.298
(Donald laughing)

1931
01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:09.636
Let me show you how DGK works.
(crowd cheering)

1932
01:56:09.678 --> 01:56:12.055
(gentle music)

1933
01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:17.811
Your eyes are opening.

1934
01:56:17.852 --> 01:56:19.771
That's good.

1935
01:56:19.813 --> 01:56:21.773
I need you awake for this.

1936
01:56:24.901 --> 01:56:27.404
I know you are wondering.

1937
01:56:27.445 --> 01:56:30.657
why does DGK kill
innocent people?

1938
01:56:30.699 --> 01:56:32.575
How does he do it

1939
01:56:32.617 --> 01:56:36.788
and why does he choose to
body paint his victims?

1940
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:39.708
(crowd continues cheering)

1941
01:56:39.749 --> 01:56:42.752
And the answers are very simple.

1942
01:56:42.794 --> 01:56:46.423
First of all. there is no one
who has incurred wrath of DGK

1943
01:56:46.464 --> 01:56:47.799
who is innocent.

1944
01:56:47.841 --> 01:56:50.051
And every one of my victims

1945
01:56:51.386 --> 01:56:54.389
are murderers of
innocent children.

1946
01:56:55.473 --> 01:56:58.476
- So. you doing this
for the children?

1947
01:57:00.145 --> 01:57:01.855
I'm doing this for humanity.

1948
01:57:01.896 --> 01:57:04.524
(Iceberg laughing)

1949
01:57:06.568 --> 01:57:09.821
- [Man 5] Yeah. you. back it
up. back it on outta here.

1950
01:57:09.863 --> 01:57:10.739
[Man 6] Do me a favor. please.

1951
01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:12.407
Please help me out.

1952
01:57:12.449 --> 01:57:15.869
(gentle music)
(Iceberg grunting)

1953
01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:18.204
You see. Ten years ago.

1954
01:57:20.707 --> 01:57:22.500
my wife had an abortion

1955
01:57:24.085 --> 01:57:27.589
and it happened on this
exact spot where I stand.

1956
01:57:29.716 --> 01:57:31.051
You see there are
many people out there

1957
01:57:31.092 --> 01:57:32.010
who look like other people

1958
01:57:32.052 --> 01:57:33.553
who just love to kill babies

1959
01:57:33.595 --> 01:57:37.724
because they don't
look like anyone else.

1960
01:57:37.766 --> 01:57:39.642
You're an idiot.

1961
01:57:39.684 --> 01:57:40.560
An idiot?

1962
01:57:42.062 --> 01:57:43.146
An idiot?

1963
01:57:44.898 --> 01:57:47.609
Not even a religious mastermind.

1964
01:57:48.818 --> 01:57:49.986
Not even a mad man.

1965
01:57:50.028 --> 01:57:52.697
Not even a psychopath.
just an idiot.

1966
01:57:52.739 --> 01:57:55.241
Just an idiot (laughing).

1967
01:57:55.283 --> 01:57:56.951
- To label you a mad
man would be an insult

1968
01:57:56.993 --> 01:57:59.579
to insane people everywhere.

1969
01:57:59.621 --> 01:58:03.208
You're too dumb to
be a mastermind.

1970
01:58:03.249 --> 01:58:04.459
You murder people without
giving them the chance

1971
01:58:04.501 --> 01:58:07.962
to defend themselves and
call yourself righteous?

1972
01:58:08.004 --> 01:58:10.632
Or even more
ridiculous and worse.

1973
01:58:13.635 --> 01:58:17.138
(gentle music continues)

1974
01:58:21.685 --> 01:58:24.771

my twin babies.

01:58:29.192 --> 01:58:31.903
And you see that
doctor right there.

1976
01:58:31.945 --> 01:58:34.322
It happened in his clinic.

1977
01:58:35.949 --> 01:58:38.368
They are the murders.

1978
01:58:38.410 --> 01:58:41.287
You're the murderer. Donald.

1979
01:58:41.329 --> 01:58:44.457
The very thing that you despise.

1980
01:58:44.499 --> 01:58:46.626
But you know who's
not a murderer?

1981
01:58:46.668 --> 01:58:47.502
Jaleece.

1982
01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:50.005
She never had an abortion.

1983
01:58:50.046 --> 01:58:51.965
She was innocent.

1984
01:58:52.007 --> 01:58:53.925

01:58:59.431 --> 01:59:00.932
And you murdered them anyways.

1987
01:59:00.974 --> 01:59:03.309
They looked like murderers!

1988
01:59:06.062 --> 01:59:08.356
They were gonna do it anyway.

1989
01:59:08.398 --> 01:59:12.235
The exact same thing.
if I didn't stop them.

1990
01:59:14.612 --> 01:59:18.658
They are who their
faces say they are.

1991
01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:23.496
(gentle music continues)
(crowd continues cheering)

1992
01:59:24.873 --> 01:59:26.708
Ladies and gentlemen.

1993
01:59:28.418 --> 01:59:32.339

the day of reckoning.

1994
01:59:36.134 --> 01:59:38.636
