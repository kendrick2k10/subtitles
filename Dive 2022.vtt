00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:24.208

-Get her out!
-Doctor!

43
00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:57.375

-I'm coming.
-What are you doing. Mariel?

47
00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:45.125
-Everybody's arriving now.
-I said I'm coming.

48
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.916
Welcome!

49
00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.791
-Where's the birthday girl?
-Today is...

50
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.875
-So silly!
-What did you do?

51
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.541
He's swimming
the 100m butterfly in a minute...

52
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:11.833
Hi!

53
00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:14.625
You're not silly at all!

54
00:05:14.708 --> 00:05:17.000
-Of course it has!
-Gold for gold.

55
00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.916
-Don't disappoint me.
-Let's see the video.

56
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.083
Sure!

57
00:05:22.708 --> 00:05:25.250
-Hey. how's Ale doing?
-She's fine.

58
00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:26.833
What did the doctor say?

59
00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:28.541
Cut that. girl!

60
00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:30.166
Let's see the video!

61
00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.750
Video!

62
00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.500
At just 15 years old.

63
00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:40.041
Mariel Saenz already has an Olympic medal.

64
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:41.541
No fear!

65
00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:44.250
-Mom. that's you!
-Yes. it's me. honey.

66
00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:47.041
You two are very much alike.

67
00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:50.416
A great achievement for Mexico's sport!

68
00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:53.291
And that's it!

69
00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.291
Mariel Saenz wins an Olympic bronze medal.

70
00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:03.541
-There's my girl!
-You were so young!

71
00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:07.958
Mariel Saenz is ready for a new challenge.

72
00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:10.958
She's a rising star for our country!

73
00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:17.083
This jump will define
Mexico's type of medal.

74
00:06:17.166 --> 00:06:20.625
-Where are you going?
-I know it by heart. mom.

75
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.041
-We want the gold!
-Shut up!

76
00:06:28.541 --> 00:06:31.458
What are you doing?
It's the best part of the video.

77
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:33.208
I know.

78
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:35.958
-Want some?
-No. When is Ale coming back?

79
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.583
She sprained her neck
and pulled her triceps.

80
00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:42.500
No.

81
00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:46.250
-She won't train for a while.
-Will she go to the FINA Cup?

82
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.791
No.

83
00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:52.833
If we don't go to the FINA Cup.
we won't qualify for the Olympics!

84
00:06:52.916 --> 00:06:54.708
Calm down!

85
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:58.958
Hey. you and Ale earned
a place in the FINA Cup

86
00:06:59.041 --> 00:07:01.291
with your victory at the Pan Am Games.

87
00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:06.500
So don't worry. the places are guaranteed.
But not necessarily for you two.

88
00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:08.291
What do you mean?

89
00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:11.875
Mariel. don't be so childish.
you're not a child.

90
00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.083
You know perfectly well what I mean.

91
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.375
Those places don't belong
to specific people.

92
00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:20.541
Those places are for Mexico.

93
00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:22.958
The Federation decides who they're for.

94
00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:24.083
Sure. yes.

95
00:07:25.208 --> 00:07:28.541
-So?
-So you will be diving for the Cup.

96
00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:31.583
But not with Ale.

97
00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.083
With who?

98
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.791
There's a very talented young girl
whose 10m dive is awesome.

99
00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:41.416
A girl? How old is she?

100
00:07:42.458 --> 00:07:44.291
Like you in Barcelona. 14.

101
00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:46.625
Are you kidding me? You can't compare!

102
00:07:46.708 --> 00:07:49.541
Are you the only prodigy in the world?

103
00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:53.125
These will be my last Olympics. Braulio!

104
00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:56.625
I'll be 30 in the next ones
and I won't be able to compete.

105
00:07:57.083 --> 00:08:01.416
The injury took me out of Sydney.
I lost the bronze in the last ones.

106
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.500
I won't get another chance.
I don't want to ruin it

107
00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:07.541
with a girl who doesn't know
what she's doing.

108
00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:10.041
I've been coaching her for one year.

109
00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:11.250
Only one year?

110
00:08:12.333 --> 00:08:14.833
So in one year
she's learned what she needs

111
00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:17.125
to compete against the world's elite?

112
00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:20.958
If I'm telling you she can do it.
it's because she can.

113
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:25.125
No. you just want her to get experience
and you're putting her with me

114
00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:27.041
so she can go to her first cup.

115
00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:31.291
No. honey.
I want you to put the Mexican team

116
00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:32.958
before your stupid ego.

117
00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:36.583
I don't want to look like a fool
in Athens with a dumb girl.

118
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:40.750
-I won't compete in those conditions.
-All right.

119
00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:42.958
Don't do it.

120
00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:45.291
And that's it.

121
00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:48.083
Seriously. Braulio?

122
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:54.250
Seriously. Mariel.
Instead of one. I'll get two.

123
00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:20.291
I'm sorry. we don't have
this kind of antibiotics.

124
00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:24.666
I can check with the other stores.

125
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.208
Two bottles of Tylenol. please.

126
00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:30.875
You can pay at the cash register.

127
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.666
60 pesos. please.

128
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.166
Tizoc. and the rest of the team?

129
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.166
In the pool.

130
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.250
They want to become artists.

131
00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:01.791
As the team has to keep going.

132
00:13:01.875 --> 00:13:06.041
we've invited a very talented girl
to be Mariel's partner.

133
00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:09.625
Her name is Nadia
and she's 14. she's brilliant.

134
00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:10.541
Nadia!

135
00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:14.750
She's 14. just the same age Mariel was.

136
00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:16.291
Look. this is Pati.

137
00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:18.375
-Hi. Nadia. how are you?
-Good.

138
00:13:18.458 --> 00:13:20.541
How do you feel here?

139
00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:22.291
It feels like a dream.

140
00:14:08.416 --> 00:14:09.458
Fuck.

141
00:14:09.541 --> 00:14:12.416
-Are you okay. Mariel?
-Yes.

142
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.041
Just a fucking cramp.

143
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:23.041
It's the third urinary infection
in two months.

144
00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:25.000
Wait. I'll sterilize this.

145
00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:27.666
Let's see. Spread.

146
00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.083
Spread more.

147
00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:33.625
I know it hurts. but you have to trust me.

148
00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:37.208
If I don't do it now.
it'll get worse later.

149
00:14:38.416 --> 00:14:39.708
There you go.

150
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.708
-Better?
-Yes.

151
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:45.000
Okay. can you get down a bit. please?

152
00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:52.833
Don't stop taking the antibiotics
in the middle of the treatment.

153
00:14:52.916 --> 00:14:55.500
How many times have we been through this?

154
00:14:55.583 --> 00:14:57.958
How come you keep getting in trouble?

155
00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:01.958
If the infection affects your kidneys.
it'll get complicated.

156
00:15:02.041 --> 00:15:06.458
What you're doing is dangerous.
you can cause antibiotic resistance...

157
00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:19.041
Hey. girl!

158
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.791
I'm sorry. I'm running late!

159
00:15:24.541 --> 00:15:25.791
Mariel!

160
00:15:26.875 --> 00:15:30.333
Wait up! Give me two minutes. just that!

161
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.541
I'm running late!

162
00:15:32.625 --> 00:15:35.458
I know. but I won't delay you.
Two minutes.

163
00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:38.666
-Girl!
-Okay.

164
00:15:39.708 --> 00:15:41.125
Let's stop arguing.

165
00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:43.541
The truth is that I...

166
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.125
I'm not a golden coin

167
00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:49.125
Braulio.

168
00:15:50.708 --> 00:15:54.041
To be of everyone's liking

169
00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:57.625
I was born like this and this is how I am

170
00:15:57.708 --> 00:16:01.500
If they don't like me. whatever!

171
00:16:01.583 --> 00:16:03.375
Shut up!

172
00:16:05.041 --> 00:16:06.541
Please!

173
00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:09.750
-Damn. girl!
-You're so ridiculous.

174
00:16:09.833 --> 00:16:10.958
Damn. girl!

175
00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:13.083
Look.

176
00:16:22.375 --> 00:16:23.541
Happy birthday.

177
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.291
I didn't give it to you at the party
because you were crazy.

178
00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:32.416
Will you wear it?

179
00:16:36.083 --> 00:16:37.833
It's a gold nugget.

180
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.458
You and me are a team. girl.

181
00:16:48.916 --> 00:16:51.208
I would never do anything to hurt you.

182
00:16:55.291 --> 00:16:56.958
If I expect too much of you.

183
00:16:58.083 --> 00:17:00.375
it's because you can do that and more.

184
00:17:03.583 --> 00:17:05.791
Together against the world. Right?

185
00:17:05.875 --> 00:17:06.791
Right.

186
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.750
What?

187
00:17:57.875 --> 00:18:00.250
Mom. why didn't you wake me up?

188
00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:02.416
They canceled the training session.

189
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.791
What do you mean they cancelled it?

190
00:18:05.875 --> 00:18:08.041
There's a crazy woman making a fuss.

191
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.125
What?

192
00:18:10.875 --> 00:18:13.833
She says Braulio did
things he shouldn't have.

193
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.291
Seriously. I'm sorry.
This is not a good time...

194
00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:26.833
What's happening with the tournaments?

195
00:18:26.916 --> 00:18:29.875
In two weeks.
my daughter is going to Tijuana.

196
00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:35.458
Seriously. I'm sorry. I apologize.
I'll let you know as soon as I can.

197
00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:38.791
Who knows? We need to know.

198
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:44.500
-What's happening?
-They suspended Braulio.

199
00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:45.458
Why?

200
00:18:48.166 --> 00:18:51.250
He's been accused of sexual abuse.

201
00:18:58.083 --> 00:18:59.000
Mariel!

202
00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:01.916
Mariel. are you okay?

203
00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:07.583
Approach straight up.

204
00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:10.000
Flex.

205
00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:18.916
One. two. Look for the angle.

206
00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:26.916
No way. it's not fair.

207
00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:33.250
If they accuse you of anything.
you don't have any rights.

208
00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:36.458
you don't even have
the benefit of the doubt.

209
00:20:37.916 --> 00:20:41.750
That bitch fucked me up! She fucked me up!

210
00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:47.166
Girl. don't leave. please.

211
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:56.291
I need help.
I don't know what to do or where to go.

212
00:20:56.375 --> 00:20:59.458
You know this will always be your home.

213
00:21:00.666 --> 00:21:03.875
Thank you. I went to the Olympic Center.

214
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.666
They slammed the door in my face
and treated me like a leper.

215
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:13.541
I have a close relationship
with all the kids.

216
00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:16.291
Of course. how could it be different?

217
00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:20.083
They live there.
and most parents live outside the city.

218
00:21:20.166 --> 00:21:23.375
We take care of them. we see them grow.

219
00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:28.250
we nurse them when they get hurt or sick.

220
00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:30.291
We know them better than anyone.

221
00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:33.250
And you know. girl.

222
00:21:34.083 --> 00:21:37.041
sports get the best out of you.
but also the worst.

223
00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:40.291
And if we as coaches ignore that.

224
00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:44.500
if we could not accept them as they are.
with all that they are...

225
00:21:45.875 --> 00:21:47.708
But for them to say that I'm...

226
00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:52.541
I have a daughter. for goodness' sake!

227
00:21:53.791 --> 00:21:58.250
How can they believe
I'm capable of doing such a thing?

228
00:21:58.333 --> 00:22:01.291
-Nobody believes that.
-Yes. they do.

229
00:22:02.166 --> 00:22:03.791
You saw it. Mariel.

230
00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:07.458
Precisely on the day
that I get Nadia to join the main team.

231
00:22:08.208 --> 00:22:10.291
her crazy mother makes a scandal.

232
00:22:10.375 --> 00:22:11.208
Why?

233
00:22:12.583 --> 00:22:14.833
Because she doesn't want her to leave!

234
00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:17.083
Because her husband left her years ago.

235
00:22:17.166 --> 00:22:20.541
and if her daughter leaves too.
she'd be all alone.

236
00:22:20.625 --> 00:22:23.125
It's unfair to fuck
someone over like this.

237
00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:24.875
to take everything away.

238
00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:27.625
just because you can't stand
to see her happy.

239
00:22:29.333 --> 00:22:31.750
I'm not the kind of person they say I am.

240
00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:37.083
I'm not the kind of person they say I am.

241
00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:40.958
Girl...

242
00:22:43.041 --> 00:22:44.583
Tell me you know that.

243
00:22:45.708 --> 00:22:46.875
Braulio.

244
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.875
you're the best man
I've ever met in my life.

245
00:22:52.208 --> 00:22:54.791
Tomorrow I'll go talk to the Federation.

246
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:58.666
She can't ruin
the reputation of a man like you

247
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.375
just because she doesn't know
what she wants.

248
00:23:01.458 --> 00:23:05.083
What if you talk to her?
You know Braulio better than anyone.

249
00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:08.916
Tell her what kind of man he is
and all he has done for you.

250
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.375
Analia is right.

251
00:23:11.583 --> 00:23:14.541
Maybe then she'll realize
the damage she's causing.

252
00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:48.750
She's a diver because of you.

253
00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:51.208
Really?

254
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:54.000
She must have been eight when she saw you

255
00:23:54.083 --> 00:23:56.875
for the first time on a TV show
and. since then.

256
00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:59.083
she never got off the springboard.

257
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.750
-So. why are you here?
-I came to see how Nadia is.

258
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.833
Nadia is angry.

259
00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:11.750
Up until recently.
it didn't matter how badly

260
00:24:11.833 --> 00:24:15.916
she wanted to be an adult
or independent or things like that.

261
00:24:17.166 --> 00:24:21.041
There was always a moment
when she was a child again.

262
00:24:23.125 --> 00:24:24.750
But then. one day.

263
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:29.458
my little girl wasn't there anymore.

264
00:24:33.375 --> 00:24:34.333
It's just that

265
00:24:35.666 --> 00:24:40.125
the moment when she indulged herself
in being a child is gone.

266
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.833
And instead.

267
00:24:47.125 --> 00:24:48.708
something obscure arose.

268
00:24:49.875 --> 00:24:50.875
A void.

269
00:24:51.541 --> 00:24:54.375
Are you sure
that something really happened?

270
00:24:54.458 --> 00:24:56.833
I am sure my daughter is not the same.

271
00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:03.625
We're going to the Olympics.

272
00:25:03.708 --> 00:25:06.791
There's nothing ordinary about that.

273
00:25:06.875 --> 00:25:10.250
And Braulio

274
00:25:10.333 --> 00:25:15.666
has to teach Nadia and me how to control

275
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.125
our minds and bodies.

276
00:25:18.208 --> 00:25:20.583
And he's the best in doing so.

277
00:25:20.666 --> 00:25:24.041
He's been training
the country's best divers for 20 years.

278
00:25:25.666 --> 00:25:26.833
But for that.

279
00:25:26.916 --> 00:25:30.041
it's necessary to build trust

280
00:25:30.125 --> 00:25:33.208
and to be close to the team members

281
00:25:34.208 --> 00:25:36.000
and that may be misconstrued.

282
00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:38.000
Yes. but there must be limits.

283
00:25:38.083 --> 00:25:41.208
and no one has the right to cross them.

284
00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:45.291
Braulio doesn't cross them.
Don't confuse your fears with the truth.

285
00:25:46.333 --> 00:25:50.125
You could ruin her life
and maybe that of a man

286
00:25:51.791 --> 00:25:54.625
who wants Nadia
to develop to her full potential.

287
00:25:56.375 --> 00:25:57.875
She's not the only one.

288
00:25:59.166 --> 00:26:00.791
There were more complaints.

289
00:26:00.875 --> 00:26:02.083
Who else complained?

290
00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:05.625
They're from a few years ago.

291
00:26:07.208 --> 00:26:10.875
Well. I've been
training with Braulio for 15 years

292
00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:15.416
and never heard of anything.
so that can't be true.

293
00:26:19.208 --> 00:26:20.541
Has that man ever done

294
00:26:22.291 --> 00:26:25.208
anything to make you feel uncomfortable?

295
00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:26.958
-No.
-No?

296
00:26:28.833 --> 00:26:29.958
Braulio saw me.

297
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:36.250
When all adults were minding
their own business.

298
00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:37.333
he saw me.

299
00:26:38.958 --> 00:26:41.916
Without him. I would be
nothing more than...

300
00:26:44.291 --> 00:26:46.000
a broken person.

301
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.666
I was everything he dreamed of.

302
00:26:50.416 --> 00:26:52.916
He's in love
with everything we can create.

303
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.791
That's why he cares about her.

304
00:26:57.333 --> 00:27:00.625
He wouldn't have spoken
to her if he didn't think so.

305
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.833
Don't take away your daughter's chance

306
00:27:03.916 --> 00:27:06.500
of working with someone
who really sees her.

307
00:27:10.416 --> 00:27:14.875
The Olympic Committee
has already started an investigation.

308
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.875
If they confirm that everything's okay.

309
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:22.083
I won't get in my daughter's way.

310
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.666
But I need to be sure
that my daughter is safe.

311
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:28.666
Do you get me?

312
00:27:35.458 --> 00:27:36.833
Thanks for stopping by.

313
00:27:39.583 --> 00:27:43.041
Your daughter can make it
to the Olympics this year.

314
00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:46.500
Not many people have
that chance at Nadia's age.

315
00:27:47.333 --> 00:27:49.250
She can't do it without Braulio.

316
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.166
I can't make it without Braulio.

317
00:27:53.333 --> 00:27:55.583
Please. think about what you're doing.

318
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.958
Come on. One. two. three.

319
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.875
Focus. Nadia. You know.
More control in take-off and stop.

320
00:28:27.416 --> 00:28:29.000
That's enough. That's it.

321
00:28:29.083 --> 00:28:33.291
-Come on. once again.
-No. Nadia. That's enough.

322
00:28:34.125 --> 00:28:37.208
-Again.
-One. two. three. Arms.

323
00:28:52.958 --> 00:28:54.416
One. two.

324
00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:02.125
Stiff. Up. Face. Then in. okay?

325
00:29:02.208 --> 00:29:03.875
One. two.

326
00:29:16.041 --> 00:29:18.791
-Ready?
-Focus. Nadia!

327
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.166
-Braulio.
-Easy.

328
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.750
Nadia!

329
00:29:25.791 --> 00:29:28.291
-What are you doing here. Braulio?
-Watching.

330
00:29:28.375 --> 00:29:30.458
They told me not to go to the pool.

331
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:33.041
-but didn't mention the seats.
-Let's work.

332
00:29:35.208 --> 00:29:38.333
I'm sorry. Braulio.
I swear it wasn't me. I swear.

333
00:29:39.041 --> 00:29:40.375
Go to the springboard.

334
00:29:41.333 --> 00:29:45.500
You have to believe me. I told her
not to come and she didn't listen.

335
00:29:46.208 --> 00:29:47.791
I have nothing to say.

336
00:29:47.875 --> 00:29:50.875
-Braulio. look at me!
-Don't touch me.

337
00:29:50.958 --> 00:29:53.250
-Braulio. please.
-Let go.

338
00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:55.583
It wasn't me!

339
00:29:55.666 --> 00:29:58.958
Nadia. get off me!
What's with you? Are you crazy?

340
00:30:00.166 --> 00:30:02.833
Are you sick? Are you trying to tease me?

341
00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:04.916
Get out of here!

342
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.625
Go to work! Get out!

343
00:30:07.583 --> 00:30:11.041
-Springboard work! Get out!
-Braulio. outside.

344
00:30:11.666 --> 00:30:14.291
This is my pool. Gerardo.
I built this place.

345
00:30:14.375 --> 00:30:18.041
I know. my friend. Let's go to my office.
Come with me. please.

346
00:30:18.125 --> 00:30:20.125
You can't treat me like this!

347
00:30:20.208 --> 00:30:22.208
-Come on.
-My team needs me!

348
00:30:22.291 --> 00:30:26.041
It's not fair
that a fucking kid ruins everything!

349
00:30:26.125 --> 00:30:28.125
It's not just about my reputation!

350
00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:31.125
I'm talking
about the upcoming Olympic Games!

351
00:30:31.208 --> 00:30:35.000
Mariel. your last Olympics
will get fucked up

352
00:30:35.083 --> 00:30:38.250
because of that fucking liar!

353
00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:41.166
That's not fair! Not fair!

354
00:30:51.291 --> 00:30:53.166
Do you like tomato sauce?

355
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.916
I can make one with olive oil and salt.

356
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.916
My mom makes it in advance.
because after the training sessions.

357
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.708
I'm starving and I could eat a horse.

358
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:06.833
Would you like tomato sauce
or olive oil and salt?

359
00:31:06.916 --> 00:31:10.208
I think you'll like the olive oil better.

360
00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:11.583
Whatever you like.

361
00:31:13.583 --> 00:31:16.375
-Let's go eat in my room. it's better.
-Okay.

362
00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:20.083
-I hope you like the pasta.
-It looks yummy.

363
00:31:20.958 --> 00:31:22.125
Come on in.

364
00:31:28.041 --> 00:31:29.458
Come on in. sit down.

365
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.291
Wow. I didn't know we had already met.

366
00:31:35.375 --> 00:31:37.291
You have articles from when I...

367
00:31:37.375 --> 00:31:39.875
You were 12. Those...

368
00:31:43.125 --> 00:31:46.875
I'm so stupid. I fucked up again.

369
00:31:46.958 --> 00:31:49.583
-Easy.
-No. I'm so stupid.

370
00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:51.583
No. it's my fault.

371
00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:55.708
I'll help you. Easy.
Everything will be okay. What's wrong?

372
00:31:55.791 --> 00:31:57.208
It's fine.

373
00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:58.833
No. nothing is okay.

374
00:31:59.625 --> 00:32:03.708
What? Everything will be okay.
What's happening? Let me help you.

375
00:32:04.291 --> 00:32:05.791
It was my fault.

376
00:32:05.875 --> 00:32:07.125
What was your fault?

377
00:32:07.208 --> 00:32:10.375
-Everything was my fault.
-What are you talking about?

378
00:32:12.375 --> 00:32:16.666
I wrote some stuff. all bullshit
that was not meant to be read

379
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.375
by anyone. not even my mom.

380
00:32:18.458 --> 00:32:21.000
-What did you write?
-It doesn't matter.

381
00:32:21.083 --> 00:32:24.500
Tell me what you wrote.
I won't tell anybody. Tell me.

382
00:32:24.583 --> 00:32:27.541
Things that didn't happen.
things I imagined.

383
00:32:27.625 --> 00:32:30.625
-It's all my fault...
-Nadia. honey!

384
00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:32.416
I'm home!

385
00:32:35.083 --> 00:32:36.375
Are you okay?

386
00:32:36.958 --> 00:32:39.083
Who gave you permission to enter?

387
00:32:39.166 --> 00:32:42.333
Don't treat me like that.
Mariel. it's late.

388
00:32:42.416 --> 00:32:43.250
Yes.

389
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.083
-What happened?
-Why do you always ruin everything?

390
00:32:47.166 --> 00:32:49.958
-Honey. please!
-Get out of my room!

391
00:33:28.541 --> 00:33:32.416
-Come on. Poncho. don't be mean.
-It's not allowed.

392
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.250
You know no visits are allowed
after 10:00 p.m.

393
00:33:36.583 --> 00:33:40.375
I'm not a visitor. I'm family.
How long have we known each other?

394
00:33:41.583 --> 00:33:44.500
Yes. right?
It's been many years. Ms. Mariel.

395
00:33:44.583 --> 00:33:48.125
-Come in.
-That's all. Poncho. Thank you!

396
00:34:13.083 --> 00:34:14.750
It's true.

397
00:34:14.833 --> 00:34:19.791
You don't see it.
but the last thing you said.

398
00:34:19.875 --> 00:34:21.375
"For Mexico!"

399
00:34:21.458 --> 00:34:25.166
-What else was I supposed to say?
-"We'll thrive and succeed!"

400
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:28.250
-What else was I supposed to say?
-No. it's okay.

401
00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:31.125
-Imagine...
-"To my coaches"?

402
00:34:31.208 --> 00:34:34.708
-Sure!
-"To Carlos"?

403
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:38.875
Yes. well. I don't know!

404
00:34:38.958 --> 00:34:40.166
Let's hear you.

405
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:44.958
"Sir. could you explain to us
what makes you a good coach?"

406
00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:48.583
-Yes.
-The cameras are on.

407
00:34:48.666 --> 00:34:50.458
All the world is watching you.

408
00:34:52.666 --> 00:34:53.875
Here I go.

409
00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.291
Mariel...

410
00:35:00.208 --> 00:35:03.666
What are you doing here?
That's what I'd like to know.

411
00:35:07.583 --> 00:35:09.833
I'm going to ruin everything. Carlos.

412
00:35:13.916 --> 00:35:17.375
I'm gonna fuck it up
and I'll lose the medal again.

413
00:35:17.458 --> 00:35:22.375
No. Mariel. What do you mean by "again"?

414
00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:25.125
Forget it. I'm too drunk.

415
00:35:25.208 --> 00:35:30.291
No. Mariel. What do you mean by that?

416
00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:32.875
When did you fuck it up? You never do.

417
00:35:32.958 --> 00:35:35.208
-Yes. I do.
-No.

418
00:35:36.291 --> 00:35:38.083
-No.
-Wanna see?

419
00:35:38.166 --> 00:35:40.291
-Mariel.
-Want to see?

420
00:35:40.375 --> 00:35:41.875
Mariel. what will you do?

421
00:35:43.916 --> 00:35:46.500
Come. I'll show you
how I always fuck it up.

422
00:35:51.583 --> 00:35:54.000
-Wanna see?
-What are you doing?

423
00:35:59.833 --> 00:36:03.791
-It's stronger than me.
-What are you doing?

424
00:36:04.541 --> 00:36:06.416
Don't worry.

425
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.916
Poncho is a bit deaf. he won't hear us.

426
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.208
So what?

427
00:36:12.291 --> 00:36:13.875
Do you remember Tampico?

428
00:36:13.958 --> 00:36:17.541
That doesn't have anything
to do with this.

429
00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:19.375
Come here!

430
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.833
Stop. See? You're too drunk.

431
00:36:22.916 --> 00:36:26.208
-I'm not drunk.
-What?

432
00:36:28.791 --> 00:36:30.291
You have to be careful.

433
00:36:32.083 --> 00:36:34.041
Mariel. what are you doing?

434
00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.625
Let's go. please!

435
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.291
Mariel. please. let's go.

436
00:36:39.375 --> 00:36:42.208
-Let's go!
-No. What happened?

437
00:36:42.291 --> 00:36:45.291
What happened is that we're too drunk.

438
00:36:45.375 --> 00:36:48.041
Wait up. come here.

439
00:36:48.125 --> 00:36:49.791
Don't be a pussy. come here.

440
00:36:54.041 --> 00:36:55.333
Fuck!

441
00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.666
Mariel. let's go.

442
00:37:03.166 --> 00:37:06.291
-Mariel. this isn't funny. Let's go!
-Okay.

443
00:37:06.375 --> 00:37:08.041
Let's go!

444
00:37:09.625 --> 00:37:11.583
Come. help me.

445
00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:13.000
Yes. let's go!

446
00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:15.791
No. Mariel!

447
00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:20.791
Are you crazy?

448
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:23.416
This is not right!

449
00:37:25.083 --> 00:37:26.416
Are you crazy. Mariel?

450
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:11.625
Like this.

451
00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:44.791
Okay.

452
00:38:45.375 --> 00:38:46.958
Who's there?

453
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.333
You've got to be kidding me!

454
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.541
Come.

455
00:39:11.708 --> 00:39:12.708
Carlos.

456
00:39:46.916 --> 00:39:49.250
Where are you? Here you are. Let's see.

457
00:39:52.416 --> 00:39:54.166
Let's see. Here you are.

458
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.708
Mariel. what are we going to do with you?

459
00:39:58.458 --> 00:40:02.500
-Can you give me something stronger?
-Not so close to the games.

460
00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:04.541
You already know that.

461
00:40:05.791 --> 00:40:06.916
Come in.

462
00:40:07.541 --> 00:40:09.375
-They are starting.
-Coming.

463
00:40:09.458 --> 00:40:11.583
-You can't go like this.
-I'm okay.

464
00:40:21.291 --> 00:40:22.625
It's about to start.

465
00:40:39.875 --> 00:40:42.250
-And the rest?
-They didn't dare to come.

466
00:40:42.916 --> 00:40:44.791
-Sure?
-Sure.

467
00:40:46.583 --> 00:40:47.625
I'm sorry.

468
00:40:48.708 --> 00:40:52.250
We are about to start. Please. be seated.

469
00:40:52.333 --> 00:40:53.833
Good morning. everyone.

470
00:40:54.666 --> 00:40:56.250
Thank you for being here.

471
00:40:56.333 --> 00:40:59.833
I appreciate the assistance
of so many important athletes.

472
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:06.250
I know you've made
a great effort to be here.

473
00:41:06.333 --> 00:41:09.875
so we'll start this trial

474
00:41:09.958 --> 00:41:12.250
to investigate Nadia Alfaro's case.

475
00:41:12.333 --> 00:41:14.125
Excuse me. Mr. Vice President.

476
00:41:14.208 --> 00:41:17.625
the ones who were going
to testify haven't arrived yet.

477
00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:19.416
Could we wait for them?

478
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.250
Mrs. Rivas.
we've been waiting for 40 minutes.

479
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:26.166
If they had wished to come.
they would've arrived.

480
00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.291
The process should be fair for everyone.

481
00:41:29.375 --> 00:41:32.541
Mr. Peralta brought
all his people to testify.

482
00:41:32.625 --> 00:41:37.625
No. excuse me. they are not "his people."
they are his colleagues.

483
00:41:37.708 --> 00:41:41.125
They are the most respected athletes
in this field.

484
00:41:41.208 --> 00:41:46.916
and they came here to talk
about their experience with their coach.

485
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.333
I think your suggestion
that they or the Federation commit

486
00:41:51.416 --> 00:41:53.916
objectionable acts is inappropriate.

487
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.583
I don't suggest anything.

488
00:41:55.666 --> 00:41:59.166
I just ask you to be fair.

489
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:02.125
-I don't want to do this.
-Let me do the talking.

490
00:42:02.208 --> 00:42:05.375
-May I speak?
-Of course. say what you need.

491
00:42:05.458 --> 00:42:08.416
Nothing what my mom is saying is true.

492
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.750
Honey. don't do this. That is not true.

493
00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:14.708
She wants us to move back
with my grandparents.

494
00:42:14.791 --> 00:42:15.958
That's the reason.

495
00:42:16.041 --> 00:42:17.291
Honey. don't do this.

496
00:42:17.375 --> 00:42:21.250
Mrs. Rivas. you have already spoken.
Now is Nadia's turn.

497
00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:24.416
Nadia is a minor.
and she can't speak for herself.

498
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.041
Of course I can speak by myself.

499
00:42:28.916 --> 00:42:29.916
Speak.

500
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.625
Everything is a lie.

501
00:42:31.708 --> 00:42:32.833
Let's go home.

502
00:42:33.416 --> 00:42:37.416
All the horrible things she says
about Braulio aren't true.

503
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.708
Just because my life is better than hers.

504
00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:46.625
I want to be here. I want to live here.

505
00:42:46.708 --> 00:42:48.625
You are my real family.

506
00:42:48.708 --> 00:42:53.791
Mrs. Rivas. clearly. something
in your home isn't right.

507
00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:58.166
I think you should take care
of what's happening inside your family

508
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:00.708
before making accusations outside of it.

509
00:43:00.791 --> 00:43:05.541
The Olympic Center is a safe place.
It always has been for all athletes.

510
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.833
Mr. Peralta is one
of the most respected members.

511
00:43:09.916 --> 00:43:15.458
And up until now. we never heard anything
so as to continue with his suspension.

512
00:43:16.375 --> 00:43:19.875
No one has testified.
not even your own daughter.

513
00:43:22.125 --> 00:43:24.375
Our community is appalled.

514
00:43:25.333 --> 00:43:27.458
These are very delicate moments.

515
00:43:27.541 --> 00:43:30.958
We are just a few weeks away
from the Olympic Games.

516
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:35.250
and we can't risk our team's performance

517
00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:37.791
due to an athlete's personal problems.

518
00:43:38.416 --> 00:43:40.916
-You can't do this.
-Mrs. Rivas. please.

519
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.208
-You don't...
-Don't do this to me!

520
00:43:43.291 --> 00:43:45.416
-Stop it!
-Baby. tell them the truth.

521
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.916
Let go off me!
If you won't listen. I'll talk to my dad.

522
00:43:51.333 --> 00:43:52.333
Nadia!

523
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:54.833
Nadia!

524
00:43:55.958 --> 00:43:56.875
Nadia!

525
00:44:03.666 --> 00:44:05.958
Put this there. kiddo.

526
00:44:06.041 --> 00:44:08.125
-You'll drop it and you'll see.
-No.

527
00:44:08.208 --> 00:44:10.125
Your mom will get angry.

528
00:44:10.208 --> 00:44:12.791
You'll drop them!

529
00:44:12.875 --> 00:44:14.833
That's missing.

530
00:44:14.916 --> 00:44:18.166
-I have extra silverware.
-Just put them in the drawer.

531
00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:21.083
-Like this?
-Yes.

532
00:44:21.166 --> 00:44:23.458
Put some here and here.

533
00:44:25.583 --> 00:44:27.958
-The doorbell.
-Like this.

534
00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:31.750
-They are here.
-Thank you. my friend.

535
00:44:31.833 --> 00:44:34.875
Honestly. thank you very much.

536
00:44:36.833 --> 00:44:38.541
Welcome!

537
00:44:38.625 --> 00:44:41.250
-Hey. beautiful!

How are you?
There's exquisite food tonight.

539
00:44:45.125 --> 00:44:47.583
We're so glad you came.

540
00:44:47.666 --> 00:44:50.000
You look so good today!

541
00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:50.916
Girl.

542
00:44:51.833 --> 00:44:54.333
And on top of it. I love Greek food!

543
00:44:54.416 --> 00:44:56.208
Come on!

544
00:44:56.291 --> 00:44:59.083
Let's go to Greece. then.

545
00:44:59.166 --> 00:45:00.875
Let's go to Greece. right?

546
00:45:00.958 --> 00:45:02.833
Yes. let's go.

547
00:45:02.916 --> 00:45:05.083
For Mariel's games. She'll win gold.

548
00:45:05.166 --> 00:45:07.791
No. honey. I have to work.

549
00:45:07.875 --> 00:45:10.500
You always have to work. No. we are going.

550
00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:14.875
I'm a simple man. I don't need anything.

551
00:45:14.958 --> 00:45:18.041
Girl. I'm a simple man. right?

552
00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:21.125
-If you say so.
-No. seriously.

553
00:45:21.208 --> 00:45:23.375
No. I don't need anything.

554
00:45:23.458 --> 00:45:26.458
I just need a reason
to wake up in the morning.

555
00:45:26.541 --> 00:45:29.291
a job to come back home and rest.

556
00:45:29.375 --> 00:45:31.166
and a family that supports me.

557
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:32.833
That's it. that all.

558
00:45:32.916 --> 00:45:35.375
In fact. I'd like

559
00:45:38.666 --> 00:45:40.041
to thank you. girl.

560
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.958
because although you were little.

561
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:47.750
you gave me a great gift.

562
00:45:47.833 --> 00:45:50.083
You chose me to be your family.

563
00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:52.791
part of your family.

564
00:45:54.625 --> 00:45:59.916
And I want to thank you too. darling.
because you never lost your faith in me.

565
00:46:01.666 --> 00:46:02.583
Thank you.

566
00:46:03.208 --> 00:46:04.333
And thank you.

567
00:46:04.416 --> 00:46:07.625
-And you too.
-My sincere gratitude.

568
00:46:07.708 --> 00:46:11.500
Cheers! Thank you all for being my family!

569
00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:14.458
Cheers!

570
00:46:14.541 --> 00:46:16.291
I got kind of emotional.

571
00:46:38.666 --> 00:46:40.625
-Hi. All good?
-Hi. Yes

00:46:40.708 --> 00:46:43.208

575
00:46:49.375 --> 00:46:52.500
-Bring the cards.
-All right.

576
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.166
Come on!

577
00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:02.125
You can leave now! Good luck!

578
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:07.916
I'll sit with Braulio now.
On the way back. I'll sit with you.

579
00:47:13.625 --> 00:47:15.125
-How are you?
-Good.

580
00:47:15.208 --> 00:47:17.500
-Excited?
-Yes. so excited.

581
00:47:25.583 --> 00:47:28.458
Your mother in law is after you!

582
00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:29.500
Bus driver.

583
00:47:29.583 --> 00:47:31.291
No. a cooler one!

584
00:47:31.375 --> 00:47:34.166
Three. two. one. Eggs with oil

585
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:37.333
Eggs with oil

586
00:47:37.458 --> 00:47:40.375
Eggs with oil

587
00:47:40.458 --> 00:47:43.875
And ham

588
00:47:43.958 --> 00:47:47.125
How could you?

589
00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:34.041
They think engagement rings

590
00:48:34.125 --> 00:48:36.333
But I can only think of Olympic rings

591
00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.708
Welcome to Guadalajara!

592
00:49:01.458 --> 00:49:03.958
-We have the afternoon free!
-To the pool!

593
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:07.500
Go to the pool.
I'll help with your homework.

594
00:49:07.583 --> 00:49:08.500
-Okay.
-Good.

595
00:49:11.083 --> 00:49:13.583
I can't believe it! Let's see this!

596
00:49:14.333 --> 00:49:15.958
Terrific. man.

597
00:49:17.333 --> 00:49:20.250
-Ask for ice!
-We already sent Alan!

598
00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:24.916
-Is this a joke?
-Nadia. to the second floor?

599
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.958
Are you kidding? Go change!

600
00:49:28.041 --> 00:49:29.500
How's the water?

601
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:31.250
Let's go. Mariel.

602
00:49:31.333 --> 00:49:34.875
The boys told me
the last one pays for the beer.

603
00:49:44.375 --> 00:49:46.000
This is so cool!

604
00:49:46.916 --> 00:49:48.333
I love it!

605
00:49:52.125 --> 00:49:54.416
-I want this bed.
-Sure.

606
00:49:56.333 --> 00:49:58.916
Braulio told me you've been here before.

607
00:49:59.375 --> 00:50:02.541
-Yes. we come almost every year.
-So cool.

608
00:50:03.125 --> 00:50:04.208
I love the hotel.

609
00:50:04.875 --> 00:50:08.875
We'll all be downstairs in the pool.
Are you coming?

610
00:50:09.833 --> 00:50:13.083
I think I'll stay here and rest.
I'm not feeling good.

611
00:50:13.708 --> 00:50:16.791
But this will be so cool.
we'll all be downstairs.

612
00:50:20.458 --> 00:50:21.500
How do I look?

613
00:50:23.666 --> 00:50:24.708
Very good.

614
00:50:26.541 --> 00:50:29.291
Let me know
in case you need anything. okay?

615
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.291
Okay.

616
00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:48.083
-Nadia!
-Come here!

617
00:50:48.166 --> 00:50:50.041
Look!

618
00:50:50.125 --> 00:50:53.500
I didn't finish high school
and I'm a success.

619
00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:57.500
-Come here!
-No. we'll be studying.

620
00:51:00.333 --> 00:51:03.041
Don't listen to them.
You'll end up like that.

621
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:05.791
I'm coming!

622
00:51:12.708 --> 00:51:13.708
Come here!

623
00:51:17.916 --> 00:51:21.708
Okay. so. where were we?

624
00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:24.958
We placed a bookmark. Here. perfect.

625
00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:27.000
Number two.

626
00:51:28.041 --> 00:51:29.666
"It is a geometric locus

627
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:33.125
formed by a set of points
that are at the same distance

628
00:51:33.208 --> 00:51:35.500
from another fixed point. the center."

629
00:52:03.166 --> 00:52:07.666
Good evening. Do you have chamomile tea?

630
00:52:09.166 --> 00:52:13.000
Could you send a thermos
with hot water and lots of tea bags?

631
00:52:15.166 --> 00:52:16.125
Thank you.

632
00:52:38.291 --> 00:52:39.291
Hello?

633
00:52:41.875 --> 00:52:44.583
Hello. Irene. Nadia isn't here.

634
00:52:45.416 --> 00:52:46.833
They're all in the pool.

635
00:52:48.583 --> 00:52:52.250
Yes. the whole team.
I can tell her you called.

636
00:52:54.458 --> 00:52:55.458
Yes. it's okay.

637
00:52:56.291 --> 00:52:58.291
Yes. I'll let her know.

638
00:53:55.958 --> 00:53:56.958
Nadia.

639
00:53:59.541 --> 00:54:01.458
Your mom called.

640
00:54:02.625 --> 00:54:04.166
I'll call her back later.

641
00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:07.375
Calm down and drink some beer.

642
00:54:10.125 --> 00:54:11.750
Nadia. it's late. Let's go.

643
00:54:12.958 --> 00:54:16.041
We have to wake up early to train.
Come on.

644
00:54:16.541 --> 00:54:18.541
If you want. we can watch a movie.

645
00:54:19.916 --> 00:54:22.166
What's with you. girl?

646
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:24.541
Do you want to steal my job as coach?

647
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:26.875
Cut that!

648
00:54:26.958 --> 00:54:31.000
Don't you remember
you were just like her at her age?

649
00:54:31.083 --> 00:54:33.750
No one buys your goody-two-shoes act.

650
00:54:33.833 --> 00:54:37.291
Please. a beer for Sister Mariel!

651
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.333
-Here. just one sip.
-I always remind you.

652
00:54:43.416 --> 00:54:44.333
Drink it!

653
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:48.750
Apologies if I offended you. Mother!

654
00:54:49.708 --> 00:54:52.916
Apologies. Mother. if I offended you!

655
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:00.833
Nadia?

656
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.416
From Guadalajara. Luis Caballero
and Jesus Crespo Ruiz.

657
00:57:22.625 --> 00:57:26.000
You roll because you're going face down.
Keep it up.

658
00:57:26.083 --> 00:57:28.333
-Come on!
-Let's go!

659
00:57:28.416 --> 00:57:29.375
You can do it!

660
00:57:33.291 --> 00:57:34.375

Flex!

669
00:58:00.875 --> 00:58:04.583
One and a half turn
and front layout in position B.

670
00:58:10.875 --> 00:58:13.166
Nadia. are you okay?

671
00:58:15.791 --> 00:58:16.875
What happened?

672
00:58:18.083 --> 00:58:21.833
Not now. Mariel. please. Ready?

673
00:58:25.541 --> 00:58:26.583
Ready?

674
00:58:36.208 --> 00:58:37.541

Synchronization. Five. six.

681
00:59:40.833 --> 00:59:42.750
Let's pack. we're leaving now.

682
00:59:43.875 --> 00:59:45.041
Let's pack!

683
00:59:47.833 --> 00:59:50.958
When you finish. go to my room.
I need to talk to you.

684
00:59:51.041 --> 00:59:51.875
Okay.

685
01:00:08.208 --> 01:00:09.458
Come in. it's open.

686
01:00:17.333 --> 01:00:18.750
Come in. Close the door.

687
01:00:26.041 --> 01:00:28.625
If you are going to get mad...

688
01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:31.958
What? Get mad?
You tell me how I should feel.

689
01:00:32.916 --> 01:00:35.416
I don't feel good.
I couldn't sleep at all.

690
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.041
I think I have a fever.
I did my best.

691
01:00:38.125 --> 01:00:41.083
-I didn't mean to do that.
-Of course you did.

692
01:00:41.166 --> 01:00:44.250
You told me that you never
wanted to work with Nadia.

693
01:00:44.333 --> 01:00:48.541
No. I told you
I didn't want someone so young.

694
01:00:48.625 --> 01:00:51.166
and that these would be my last games.

695
01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:53.083
Look how things worked out now.

696
01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:57.250
Now. you're going
to your last games thanks to Nadia

697
01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:59.750
because what you did today was bullshit.

698
01:00:59.833 --> 01:01:02.083
You've been doing a shitty job lately.

699
01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:07.208
The level of difficulty of the dive
prevented you from being disqualified.

700
01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:11.625
Look. you're a talented girl.

701
01:01:11.708 --> 01:01:15.208
There's no doubt about it.
but you don't have guts.

702
01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:19.083
You made it through one Olympics.

703
01:01:19.166 --> 01:01:22.458
Only one. And what about the rest?

704
01:01:22.541 --> 01:01:25.250
You were disqualified
for a stupid mistake.

705
01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:30.458
And the rest?
You didn't even get on the plane. Mariel!

706
01:01:30.541 --> 01:01:33.583
You can't handle the pressure!

707
01:01:33.666 --> 01:01:37.541
If you want to sabotage yourself.
I'm sorry for you.

708
01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:39.750
but it's your choice. your decision.

709
01:01:40.416 --> 01:01:43.000
But you're ruining a little girl's chance

710
01:01:43.083 --> 01:01:47.125
who's just beginning because you're afraid
she'll do better than you.

711
01:01:47.208 --> 01:01:49.625
That's twisted. Mariel.

712
01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:53.875
I didn't mean to!
I've been sick several weeks.

713
01:01:53.958 --> 01:01:55.916
And why are you sick?

714
01:01:56.791 --> 01:02:00.708
Because you're fucking everyone again!

715
01:02:01.291 --> 01:02:02.416
That's why.

716
01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:05.416
What?

717
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.291
You thought I wouldn't know
you fucked Carlos the other night?

718
01:02:10.083 --> 01:02:13.791
-Carlos was not supposed to...
-It wasn't Carlos. It wasn't him!

719
01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:19.208
Alicia told me you've got
the weird infection again.

720
01:02:20.541 --> 01:02:22.458
We all know everything. girl.

721
01:02:22.541 --> 01:02:27.000
And with you.
it's the same old story once and again.

722
01:02:27.083 --> 01:02:29.041
You can't stop fucking.

723
01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:34.041
as you can't stop screwing up your life
and the lives of those around you.

724
01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:40.125
The Federation wants to get rid of you.

725
01:02:41.708 --> 01:02:44.416
They say you're too old.

726
01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:47.833
But I asked them
to give you another chance.

727
01:02:47.916 --> 01:02:50.416
I said Nadia and you
were the perfect team.

728
01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.250
that there's nothing better.

729
01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:55.208
-Thank you.
-And you fucked it up today!

730
01:02:55.791 --> 01:03:00.375
-Help me. please!
-Please. don't cry.

731
01:03:00.458 --> 01:03:04.750
-I swear I can do it.
-Don't make a scene!

732
01:03:04.833 --> 01:03:08.541
-Forgive me. Braulio!
-Calm down. for goodness' sake.

733
01:03:08.625 --> 01:03:10.625
Go to the bathroom!

734
01:03:10.708 --> 01:03:13.041
-Wash your face and calm down!
-Sorry!

735
01:03:13.125 --> 01:03:15.916
-I don't want them to see you like this.
-Okay.

736
01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:24.250
Stupid girl!

737
01:03:27.083 --> 01:03:28.333
Stupid girl!

738
01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:15.000
Are you okay?

739
01:04:16.791 --> 01:04:17.791
Yes!

740
01:04:29.458 --> 01:04:31.500
-More at ease now?
-Yes.

741
01:04:33.208 --> 01:04:37.833
I need to rest a bit more.
I swear I won't fuck up anymore.

742
01:04:39.291 --> 01:04:40.291
I hope so. girl.

743
01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:46.375
Seriously.

744
01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:49.083
Yes.

745
01:05:26.125 --> 01:05:27.041
Nadia?

746
01:05:28.333 --> 01:05:31.375
I'm almost ready!
Tell them I won't take long!

747
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:33.750
Okay!

748
01:05:45.125 --> 01:05:46.250
Let's go now!

749
01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:58.958
-Shall we go?
-Yes. I'll be right there.

750
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:50.166
-My friend.
-You did it by a whisker.

751
01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.458
At least we qualified.

752
01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:54.791
-Daddy!
-Hi. honey!

753
01:06:54.875 --> 01:06:56.166
-Welcome.
-Thanks.

754
01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:57.083
Welcome.

755
01:06:57.166 --> 01:06:59.500
-I missed you so much!
-Me too.

756
01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:01.333
Welcome. Felix.

757
01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:02.541
Where's your mommy?

758
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:20.500
I like having our secret.

759
01:08:23.791 --> 01:08:27.958
He asked if he could touch me.
That had never happened before.

760
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:36.125
I couldn't speak because
he was kissing me so hard and when...

761
01:08:39.958 --> 01:08:42.083
he started touching my chest.

762
01:08:42.166 --> 01:08:44.166
He had never touched me there.

763
01:09:03.333 --> 01:09:05.166
I WANT TO SCREAM

764
01:09:10.916 --> 01:09:13.291
I would never do anything to hurt you.

765
01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:17.416
Easy. Mariel.

766
01:09:19.083 --> 01:09:20.458
You're burning up.

767
01:09:28.666 --> 01:09:30.208
He was kissing me so hard.

768
01:09:35.791 --> 01:09:38.000
Something started between us.

769
01:09:38.083 --> 01:09:40.375
No one else needs to know.

770
01:09:41.583 --> 01:09:44.541
Why don't you call the doctor. Gerardo?

771
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.416
If the fever increases.
she has to go to the hospital.

772
01:10:06.541 --> 01:10:08.833
He told me he'd teach me how to feel.

773
01:10:27.583 --> 01:10:31.541
They say it's not a problem.
If she trains at least for two weeks...

774
01:10:31.625 --> 01:10:33.250
I know her. Braulio.

775
01:10:33.333 --> 01:10:35.458
Damn. Mariel! Fuck!

776
01:10:43.416 --> 01:10:46.791
I'd leave everything for you. Mariel.
I swear.

777
01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.708
Flex here.

778
01:10:56.875 --> 01:10:58.750
That's right!

779
01:10:58.833 --> 01:11:01.166
Long. Push the platform.

780
01:11:01.708 --> 01:11:02.708
Very good.

781
01:11:07.208 --> 01:11:08.541
Good. Mariel. Come on!

782
01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:11.333
Come on. stretch your leg.

783
01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.666
Push it in. That's right.

784
01:11:20.708 --> 01:11:22.250
Hard. That's right.

785
01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:24.916
Nadia is not training?

786
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:27.583
Weren't we a team?

787
01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:40.541
Nadia has been working this whole time.
You're the one who has to catch up.

788
01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:46.833
Yes. but we're diving together.
and I have to train with her.

789
01:11:46.916 --> 01:11:51.000
No. honey. what you need is
to do what I tell you to. okay?

790
01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:55.666
-Braulio. I can...
-No. Who's the coach here? You?

791
01:11:57.250 --> 01:11:59.916
Mariel. will you tell us all what to do?

792
01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:02.833
Will you coach the team now?

793
01:12:03.541 --> 01:12:05.041
That's all I needed!

794
01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:10.250
I'm giving you a chance.
Don't push my buttons and get to work!

795
01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:14.583
No one is giving me a chance.
I'm here because I've earned it.

796
01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:17.083
Get down!

797
01:12:18.666 --> 01:12:21.083
Get down from the platform right now!

798
01:12:21.791 --> 01:12:24.458
Get down. Mariel!
I'm telling you to get down!

799
01:12:27.583 --> 01:12:29.708
All right! You're done.

800
01:12:30.208 --> 01:12:32.541
I came to train with my partner.

801
01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:35.458
-You're done for today.
-We're only weeks away...

802
01:12:35.541 --> 01:12:38.208
-Get out of the pool!
-...from the Olympics!

803
01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:41.958
Get out right now or you'll be expelled!

804
01:12:42.041 --> 01:12:44.083
What do you say? Right now!

805
01:12:45.083 --> 01:12:46.166
Get out!

806
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:49.625
And don't think of coming here

807
01:12:49.708 --> 01:12:53.166
if you're not willing
to follow my fucking orders!

808
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:34.541
Would you like to eat anything?
Gerardo took your siblings to a game.

809
01:14:03.958 --> 01:14:06.833
-Are you okay. Yeya?
-Not now. Mom.

810
01:14:06.916 --> 01:14:08.500
What's going on. honey?

811
01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.125
Please. I want to be alone.

812
01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:15.875
What's going on. Mariel?

813
01:14:15.958 --> 01:14:17.916
I don't want to talk right now.

814
01:14:18.791 --> 01:14:24.083
We have to talk.
I won't let you do what you always do.

815
01:14:25.791 --> 01:14:29.166
What I always do?
What the fuck are you talking about?

816
01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:30.875
You're sabotaging yourself.

817
01:14:30.958 --> 01:14:34.916
The Olympic Games are near.
and you've become self-destructive.

818
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Where did you get that shit from?

819
01:14:37.625 --> 01:14:41.291
Braulio called this afternoon
and said you were out of control.

820
01:14:41.375 --> 01:14:43.666
Leave before anything happens.

821
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:47.083
I'm not going anywhere
until you explain to me

822
01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:50.208
why you're destroying
everything you've built.

823
01:14:52.041 --> 01:14:55.250
-Stop it. for fuck's sake!
-Don't talk to me like that!

824
01:14:55.333 --> 01:14:57.958
You want to know
what's happening? All right!

825
01:15:05.166 --> 01:15:08.000
The great mystery
is that you were there. right?

826
01:15:08.666 --> 01:15:11.166
Every year. in every fucking tournament.

827
01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:14.250
you were there.

828
01:15:14.333 --> 01:15:19.000
Or he was here. because he's family.
because we're a fucking happy family.

829
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.875
How could you not know. Mom?

830
01:15:30.666 --> 01:15:33.750
"Easy. girl. you rock here."

831
01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:37.500
"If you make a good dive.
"I'll make you feel real good."

832
01:15:37.583 --> 01:15:39.708
"I'll teach you how to be my woman."

833
01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:41.625
What's wrong with you?

834
01:15:41.708 --> 01:15:43.666
"You taste so good. girl."

835
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:45.125
You're messed up.

836
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:48.375
"You'll never find someone like me."

837
01:15:48.458 --> 01:15:51.083
How can you say something so appalling?

838
01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.500
-"I can't live without you. girl."
-You're so sick!

839
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.458
Didn't you want to know
what was going on?

840
01:16:02.333 --> 01:16:04.041
That's what happened.

841
01:16:05.166 --> 01:16:07.958
right under your fucking nose.
the whole time.

842
01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:16.375
Why did you let me go to Monterrey?

843
01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:22.166
You were supposed to take care of me.

844
01:16:31.458 --> 01:16:32.500
Mom!

845
01:16:49.708 --> 01:16:51.125
You scared me to death!

846
01:16:52.125 --> 01:16:53.125
Sorry.

847
01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:03.250
-Nadia was worried too.
-Why?

848
01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:06.916
"Why?" You're a team. right?

849
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:14.166
Are you ready to do team work
or are we still having issues?

850
01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:15.375
No issues.

851
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:20.083
Stop. Braulio. let me go!

852
01:17:22.916 --> 01:17:26.833
I'll see you in 20 at the pool.
Everybody to the pool!

853
01:17:27.416 --> 01:17:31.791
Remember. arms. with strength!

854
01:17:31.875 --> 01:17:35.541
Approach straight up. Jump!

855
01:17:35.625 --> 01:17:36.916
Like that!

856
01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:39.708
Again!

857
01:17:41.083 --> 01:17:42.458
Again!

858
01:17:44.791 --> 01:17:47.791
Nadia. your face! That's right!

859
01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:54.500
Please. focus!

860
01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:03.000
You're not in sync. please!

861
01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:10.666
Push the platform.

862
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:13.541
Rib tuck. Look for the water and flex.

863
01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:19.625
-Who told you to stop?
-Nadia is tired.

864
01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:21.208
Did I tell you to stop?

865
01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:29.791
Come on! We can't be doing this all day!

866
01:18:35.916 --> 01:18:38.458
Watch out! You were ahead.

867
01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:42.041
If you want to chat. go to a café!

868
01:18:46.291 --> 01:18:47.875
Arms! With strength!

869
01:18:50.166 --> 01:18:51.083
Again!

870
01:18:51.708 --> 01:18:52.750
You count.

871
01:18:58.041 --> 01:18:59.375
One. two.

872
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:10.541
-Damn! That's worth the gold!
-Come on. team!

873
01:19:10.625 --> 01:19:14.916
Motherfucker! Excellent. I see gold now!

874
01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:24.375
Did you pack already?
I already packed mine.

875
01:19:24.458 --> 01:19:26.333
My dad says that's ridiculous.

876
01:19:26.416 --> 01:19:29.958
because me and my mom pack
two days before the trip

877
01:19:30.041 --> 01:19:31.708
so we don't forget anything.

878
01:19:32.416 --> 01:19:34.041
Do you think it'll be cold?

879
01:19:34.583 --> 01:19:37.958
-I searched on the Internet...
-I know about Braulio.

880
01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:43.083
I don't know what you mean.

881
01:19:44.708 --> 01:19:46.500
The same happened to me.

882
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:53.208
Nadia.

883
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Nadia. please. let me help you.

884
01:20:03.083 --> 01:20:04.625
I don't need your help.

885
01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:08.791
What he's doing is wrong.

886
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:13.041
He's our coach. He's an adult.
And you're a little girl.

887
01:20:14.583 --> 01:20:15.916
I'm not a little girl.

888
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.166
You're 14. I was your same age.
But I was all alone. and you are not.

889
01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:24.166
-You don't get what happens between us.
-I perfectly get it.

890
01:20:25.125 --> 01:20:27.416
He's telling you that you rock.

891
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.291
that you're special
and there's no one like you.

892
01:20:30.375 --> 01:20:33.291
that you must keep the secret
because they won't get it.

893
01:20:33.375 --> 01:20:35.875
I perfectly know what he's telling you.

894
01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:39.541
Braulio was right.
He said you'd try to screw everything up.

895
01:20:39.625 --> 01:20:42.500
You're so damn jealous! I don't care!

896
01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:45.916
Back from Greece.
we'll get married and he'll be with me.

897
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.333
He's leaving his wife.

898
01:21:14.166 --> 01:21:15.083
What happened?

899
01:21:16.791 --> 01:21:18.333
You have to take a shower.

900
01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.291
Today's the press conference.

901
01:21:26.083 --> 01:21:27.500
Braulio came to see you.

902
01:21:29.666 --> 01:21:30.666
He's downstairs.

903
01:21:32.958 --> 01:21:34.375
He wants to talk to you.

904
01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:38.208
He called last night.

905
01:21:39.958 --> 01:21:42.583
I think you need
to apologize to him. Mariel.

906
01:21:46.833 --> 01:21:48.500
We're so close. honey.

907
01:22:18.125 --> 01:22:20.625
-If you came to threaten me...
-No. Mariel.

908
01:22:22.833 --> 01:22:24.208
I came to apologize.

909
01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:30.500
Forgive me.

910
01:22:35.958 --> 01:22:37.291
Forgive me. please.

911
01:22:39.791 --> 01:22:41.625
I was so confused.

912
01:22:43.791 --> 01:22:45.208
And now I realize

913
01:22:47.083 --> 01:22:49.250
that I've become a monster.

914
01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:55.666
I am a human being

915
01:22:57.541 --> 01:23:00.000
with flaws and weaknesses.

916
01:23:02.208 --> 01:23:05.708
but I don't want that to justify
all the damage I've done.

917
01:23:07.291 --> 01:23:08.708
especially to you. girl.

918
01:23:10.041 --> 01:23:11.416
Forgive me. please.

919
01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:16.041
You're Mariel.

920
01:23:16.916 --> 01:23:18.166
My Mariel.

921
01:23:21.041 --> 01:23:24.083
We had a very special relationship. girl.

922
01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:29.000
And I miss it.

923
01:23:29.875 --> 01:23:31.250
I miss it so much.

924
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.375
I need you.

925
01:23:35.041 --> 01:23:37.083
And I know you need me too.

926
01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:41.875
You and I are meant for each other.

927
01:23:43.291 --> 01:23:44.291
Please.

928
01:23:47.041 --> 01:23:49.166
Let's give ourselves another chance.

929
01:23:53.125 --> 01:23:54.750
We have to be together.

930
01:23:55.708 --> 01:23:57.666
Don't you ever touch me again...

931
01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:03.250
in your fucking life.

932
01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:09.791
Don't ever touch me again.

933
01:24:17.791 --> 01:24:19.166
Do you want your medal?

934
01:24:22.208 --> 01:24:24.291
Don't you dare touch her.

935
01:24:26.791 --> 01:24:32.041
If you get close to her again.
I'll tell everything to everyone.

936
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:37.875
I don't give a fuck
if my life goes down with yours.

937
01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:44.208
I mean it.

938
01:24:54.083 --> 01:24:56.625
We want to honor these athletes

939
01:24:56.708 --> 01:24:59.875
who are traveling to Greece tomorrow

940
01:24:59.958 --> 01:25:05.875
to represent Mexico
in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

941
01:25:05.958 --> 01:25:07.958
A round of applause. please!

942
01:25:08.041 --> 01:25:09.875
Bravo!

943
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.500
We're very proud to represent our country.

944
01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:27.000
-My pleasure.
-Good luck. Mariel.

945
01:25:27.083 --> 01:25:30.333
All right. kids. it's time! Let's go!

946
01:25:31.458 --> 01:25:33.333
I'm so proud of you. honey.

947
01:25:33.916 --> 01:25:35.125
Let's go. kids!

948
01:25:36.625 --> 01:25:40.458
Mexico!

949
01:25:51.583 --> 01:25:52.583
Irene.

950
01:25:57.791 --> 01:25:58.958
Forgive me.

951
01:27:20.625 --> 01:27:23.375
From Greece. Eftihia Pappa

952
01:27:24.666 --> 01:27:26.708
and Florentia Sfakianou.

953
01:27:27.583 --> 01:27:30.666
From Mexico. Mariel Saenz

954
01:27:31.541 --> 01:27:33.500
and Nadia Alfaro.

955
01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:53.208
Mariel has achieved the best performance
in her whole career.

956
01:27:53.291 --> 01:27:55.333
We'll see the Mexican duet.

957
01:27:55.416 --> 01:28:00.416
A brilliant duet formed
by expertise and youth.

958
01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.875
They'll perform the last dive.

959
01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:08.166
A dive with a great level of difficulty.

960
01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:11.625
They already dominate this technique.

961
01:28:11.708 --> 01:28:14.833
despite the short time
they've been training together.

962
01:28:14.916 --> 01:28:17.333
It's the last dive of the competition.

963
01:28:17.416 --> 01:28:20.291
All Mexico's watching what could be

964
01:28:20.375 --> 01:28:24.208
the first medal
for the Mexican Olympic Team.

965
01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:27.500
I WANT TO SCREAM

966
01:28:41.125 --> 01:28:44.000
I'd have liked to do something before.

967
01:28:44.083 --> 01:28:45.416
but I couldn't.

968
01:29:06.916 --> 01:29:09.291
What? How? This can't be true!

969
01:29:09.416 --> 01:29:12.708
This is really extraordinary!

970
01:29:16.791 --> 01:29:19.458
It doesn't seem to be an injury.

971
01:29:19.541 --> 01:29:21.958
but something must have happened

972
01:29:22.041 --> 01:29:25.083
because Mexico is leaving
without its medal.

973
01:29:31.375 --> 01:29:35.000
Braulio Peralta told me
he'd never met anyone like me.

974
01:29:35.083 --> 01:29:37.916
something that surely
he also told your daughter.

975
01:29:38.916 --> 01:29:41.333
If it hadn't been for Nadia.

976
01:29:41.416 --> 01:29:44.583
I might never have woken up
from this nightmare.

977
01:29:45.875 --> 01:29:48.750
The only thing I can give her
is the truth.

978
01:29:49.833 --> 01:29:54.041
and hope she can run away
before this hell consumes her alive.

979
01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:15.750
