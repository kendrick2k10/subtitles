(Ruby panting)

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.083
- This is Ruby.

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:18.919
Ruby here. come in. come in.

(Ruby panting)

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.592
- [Jack] Ruby. Ruby. did
you get out of there?

9
00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:25.726
- No. I'm still inside.

10
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.230
Where are you? What the
hell is going on here?

11
00:00:30.398 --> 00:00:33.801
- [Jack] Ruby. I made
it into the woods.

12
00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.369
I'm heading for the clearing.

13
00:00:35.403 --> 00:00:38.406
When I get to the jeeps. I
will get help for you. okay?

14
00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:41.375
And I'm going to come back
for you. all right? I swear.

15
00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:42.210
- Please. hurry.

Jack?

19
00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.186
Jack are you there?

(woman pants)

25
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.082
Okay. we got to get out of here.

26
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.283
It's coming.

27
00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:24.785
- What the hell
is going on here?

28
00:01:24.852 --> 00:01:26.254
- We just got five minutes
until the game ends.

29
00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:29.690
and then we just gotta survive
the next 24 hours. okay?

(robot whirring)

31
00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:37.465

I won this!

42
00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:41.695
- [Robot] Welcome to the hotel.

43
00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:43.964

enjoyed your stay.

(heavy suspenseful music)

52
00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:20.768
- I just want these
feelings to go away.

53
00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:27.508
- And how have you been
coping with everything lately?

54
00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:31.412
- I've been doing okay.

55
00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:33.881
Everything I can.

56
00:03:36.284 --> 00:03:37.485
But with him gone.

57
00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:44.758
I just didn't expect to be
in this situation at my age.

58
00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:45.559
You know?

59
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.829
Nothing prepares you for this.

60
00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:54.868
And the worst thing is...

61
00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:57.305
Thinking about what I'm
going to do with finances.

62
00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:01.409
I'm a single mom of two kids.

63
00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:05.446
and I'm struggling
to support myself.

64
00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:09.750
let alone them at times.

65
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.952
- Well. you know what
they say find a job

66
00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:13.987
that doesn't feel like a job.

67
00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.558
And. how about a
change of careers?

68
00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:22.129
- I don't have time
to learn a new skill.

69
00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:24.832
I was trying to build a
business before what happened.

70
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.202
I just don't have the time
or the resources anymore.

71
00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:32.239
Let alone the energy.

72
00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:41.849
- You can't let this impact
your life. your future.

73
00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:44.151
You need to start thinking
about what makes you happy now.

74
00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:44.985
Sienna.

75
00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:48.088
I mean. haven't you got anyone

76
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.891
that could help relieve
the stress of the kids?

77
00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:53.627
- It's just me.

78
00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:57.765
And I feel like everyone
just wants me to move on

79
00:04:57.765 --> 00:04:59.266
and get over it. at this point.

80
00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:01.569
- You'll never get
over him. Sienna.

81
00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:03.771
That is totally normal.

82
00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:07.708
But you will find a
way to live your life.

83
00:05:07.775 --> 00:05:09.677
and to live it with the memories

84
00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:11.244
of what you did have with him.

85
00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.285
- I just don't see that
happening anytime soon.

86
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.155
And I guess...

87
00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:26.360
That's the worry.

88
00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:30.097
- [Jamie] Hey Jamie here.

89
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.565
I can't get to the
phone right now.

90
00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:34.167
So. leave me a message and
I'll get back to you shortly.

91
00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.012
(Sienna sighs)

92
00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:47.815
(phone vibrates)

93
00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:52.586
- Hey Leigh-

94
00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:54.187
- [Leigh] Sienna. where are you?

95
00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:57.725
You were supposed to be back
more than half an hour ago.

96
00:05:57.725 --> 00:05:58.959
- Sorry. I'm heading back now.

97
00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:01.228
- [Leigh] No. look I told you.

98
00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:03.497
I had certain places
to be tonight.

99
00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:07.735
- I'm heading back
right now. sorry Leigh.

100
00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:09.236
- [Leigh] I will see you soon.

101
00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:18.946
(sullen piano music)

102
00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:32.192
(sullen piano music)

103
00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:59.119
(car door slams)

104
00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.354
- Kids. where's Leigh?

105
00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:09.429
Kids?

106
00:07:09.497 --> 00:07:11.231
- She left on a hot
date or something.

107
00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:16.604
- Of course she did.

108
00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:17.805
So the babysitter headed out.

109
00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:19.406
without waiting
for me to get home.

110
00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.813
Kids will one of you
get that for me. please.

111
00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:28.115
And if it's Leigh. no.
she's not getting paid.

112
00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:32.252
(phone rings)
No?

113
00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:33.320
(Peter groans)
- Mom!

114
00:07:34.522 --> 00:07:36.757
(phone rings)

115
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.225
Hello.

116
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.693
- [Games Master] Can I speak
to Sienna Woods. please?

117
00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:40.961
Your mother entered
our competition.

118
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.096
and we'd like to discuss
her participating.

119
00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:47.433
- Let me just get her.

120
00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.039
You applied to a game show.
and they want you to go on it.

121
00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:56.710
(light piano music)

122
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.078
- Hello?

123
00:07:58.078 --> 00:07:59.446
- [Games Master] Sienna Woods?

124
00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:00.848
- Speaking.

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:02.215
- You applied for
our competition here

126
00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:03.316
at the Dinosaur Hotel.

127
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.053
You were selected.

128
00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:07.855
And we would love to
offer you the opportunity

129
00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:09.657
to come down this week.
and to begin the challenge.

130
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.490
- Wow.

131
00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.995
I mean. I applied for
a lot of things online.

132
00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:17.097
can you just tell me
a bit more about it?

133
00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:19.867
- [Games Master] I will
email you the details.

134
00:08:21.134 --> 00:08:22.936
Congratulations Sienna.

135
00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:25.505
You're one of the few selected.

136
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:28.842
- Thank you.

137
00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:37.250
Looks like mommy's
going on a game show.

138
00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.922
(Maddie and Peter cheer)

139
00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:44.558
(Peter giggles)

140
00:08:47.294 --> 00:08:50.363
(dark ominous music)

141
00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:05.746
- [Sienna] You have been
selected out the masses

142
00:09:05.813 --> 00:09:09.516
for a brand new game show
at the Dinosaur Hotel.

143
00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:14.087
Where all your wildest
dreams. can come true.

144
00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:19.593
Where the impossible
is possible.

145
00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:23.797
and all bets are off in
the ultimate challenge.

146
00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:26.867
- What is the challenge?

147
00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:31.705
- It doesn't say.
maybe it's a surprise.

148
00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:34.374
So nobody can preplan
how to win it.

149
00:09:34.374 --> 00:09:36.276
Kind of like one of those
shows with the questions

150
00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:39.112
where you have to figure
it out in the moment.

151
00:09:39.146 --> 00:09:41.014
100.000 pounds.

152
00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:44.184
grand prize!

153
00:09:46.987 --> 00:09:47.788
Wow.

154
00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:52.760
- [Peter] Please. win it Mom.

155
00:09:54.161 --> 00:09:55.362
- I'll try my best.

156
00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:57.798
Christ. I've got to get
packing. and I've got

157
00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:01.568
to find somewhere to put
you two whilst I'm away.

158
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.571
- [Maddie and Peter] Mom's
going on a game show!

159
00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:07.574
- Mom's going on a game show!

160
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.209
Mom's going on a game show!

161
00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:10.944
(all laugh)

162
00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:15.448
Mom's going on a game show!
Mom's going on a game show!

163
00:10:15.482 --> 00:10:17.885
Mom's going on a game show!

164
00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:20.087
(door opens)

165
00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:22.890
(dinosaurs growl)

166
00:10:24.725 --> 00:10:26.359
- It's feeding time.

167
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:30.731
- Come on. Leigh.

168
00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:32.866
Please!

169
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:37.137
It's only for the weekend.
you've got to have them.

170
00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:40.440
This could be a huge
opportunity for me.

171
00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:43.711
And you know the
struggles I've been having

172
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:45.312
with money recently.

173
00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:48.248
Help me out?

174
00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:49.649
Please.
- [Leigh] I would if I could.

175
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.585
Sienna. but I am meeting
a new guy tonight.

176
00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:57.424
- I'll pay you double.
how about that?

177
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.491
(Leigh groans)

178
00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:00.393
- [Leigh] I'm sorry. Sienna.

179
00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:02.329
I really do hope
you find someone.

180
00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:08.401

359
00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:34.246
- [Zara] Help us!

360
00:23:38.084 --> 00:23:41.287
(woman pants)

361
00:23:41.287 --> 00:23:43.590
- What the hell is going on?

362
00:23:45.725 --> 00:23:47.293
- Where are you going?

363
00:23:47.293 --> 00:23:49.529
- I'm getting the
hell out of here!

364
00:23:49.562 --> 00:23:53.733
(heavy suspenseful music)

365
00:23:53.733 --> 00:23:55.935
- [Sienna] Where did it go?

366
00:23:58.204 --> 00:23:59.405
- Come on then!

367
00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:04.043
(intense suspenseful music)

368
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.349
(birds chirp)

369
00:24:17.924 --> 00:24:20.727
(dinosaur growls)

370
00:24:21.761 --> 00:24:23.429
- [Peter] What was that?

371
00:24:23.496 --> 00:24:25.865
- [Maddie] Looks like
there are more than one.

372
00:24:25.865 --> 00:24:28.067
- [Peter] That one
didn't sound so friendly.

373
00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:42.281
- [Maddie] I think
we should go back.

374
00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:44.817
- [Peter] Come on. you
want to see it. right?

375
00:24:44.851 --> 00:24:46.385
- [Maddie] You want to see
it. I'm happy seeing it

376
00:24:46.385 --> 00:24:50.256
through the bedroom window.
thank you very much.

377
00:24:50.289 --> 00:24:55.294
- {Peter] We do it. then we
go back. it won't take long.

378
00:24:56.696 --> 00:24:59.065
- [Maddie] You can find it.
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

379
00:24:59.065 --> 00:25:00.332
- [Peter] Maddie. Come on!

380
00:25:12.311 --> 00:25:14.080
- [Maddie] Come back!

381
00:25:26.292 --> 00:25:27.093
Come back!

382
00:25:29.696 --> 00:25:32.364
(Laura pants)

383
00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:33.766
- Hey. wait!

384
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.001
- No! I'm getting in my car

385
00:25:35.034 --> 00:25:36.468
and I'm getting the
hell out of here!

386
00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:39.105
(T-Rex growls)

387
00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:45.411
(Zara screams)

388
00:25:45.444 --> 00:25:48.047
(Zara screams)

389
00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.086
(Laura screams)

390
00:25:56.689 --> 00:25:59.158
(T-Rex roars)

391
00:26:01.193 --> 00:26:04.597
(soft suspenseful music)

392
00:26:19.612 --> 00:26:23.015
(soft suspenseful music)

393
00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:28.487
- It fucking ate her!

394
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.891
We need to leave now.
we're not safe here!

395
00:26:31.891 --> 00:26:33.726
- [Robot] Congratulations!

396
00:26:33.726 --> 00:26:36.763
As the first contestant
exits the game.

397
00:26:36.796 --> 00:26:39.799
your chances of winning
have now improved.

398
00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:42.635
- My kids.

399
00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:43.736
- What is it?

400
00:26:45.004 --> 00:26:46.005
- My kids...

401
00:26:48.574 --> 00:26:49.976
They're upstairs.

402
00:26:50.009 --> 00:26:53.212
- [Robot] Anyone who has
walked into the Dinosaur Hotel

403
00:26:53.212 --> 00:26:57.717
is just as much a part of the
competition as anyone else.

404
00:26:57.717 --> 00:26:59.451
- My kids aren't
part of this game.

405
00:27:00.552 --> 00:27:02.321
You leave them alone.
do you hear me?

406
00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:05.725
- [Robot] Your
children included.

407
00:27:06.893 --> 00:27:08.560
- They're not part of the deal.

408
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.997
And they're not
part of the plan.

409
00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.799
I signed up to this. not them.

410
00:27:14.767 --> 00:27:15.567
Not them!

411
00:27:17.236 --> 00:27:20.072
- [Robot] I will repeat
myself once again.

412
00:27:20.106 --> 00:27:25.111
Those within the hotel must
participate in the challenge.

413
00:27:25.712 --> 00:27:27.880
(bat clatters)

414
00:27:28.748 --> 00:27:31.417
(robot putters)

415
00:27:34.253 --> 00:27:38.057
- What do you mean
your kids are upstairs?

416
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.427
- My kids are upstairs. and
I'm going to go get them.

417
00:27:41.427 --> 00:27:43.295
- You can't go up there.

418
00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:44.530
Not with that thing
roaming around.

419
00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.233
- That thing was a T-Rex!

420
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.870
Girls. that's one hell
of killing machine.

421
00:27:50.937 --> 00:27:53.005
Sienna. she's right. you
need to stay with us.

422
00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:55.708
and wait it out until
the coast is clear.

423
00:27:56.843 --> 00:28:00.079
- My kids are like
sitting ducks up there.

424
00:28:00.112 --> 00:28:01.547
I can't just sit here
and wait for them

425
00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:03.883
to open the doors so
that thing snaps them up.

426
00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.591
I've got to do something.

427
00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:15.928
(door opens)

428
00:28:26.405 --> 00:28:29.876
(soft suspenseful music)

429
00:28:38.684 --> 00:28:42.454
- Hello?
(walkie crackles)

430
00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:45.825
Can anyone hear me?
(walkie crackles)

431
00:28:45.892 --> 00:28:47.326
- [Zara] Sienna. wait!
- No. I'm going

432
00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:49.728
to get my kids. and we're going
to get the hell out of here.

433
00:28:49.762 --> 00:28:51.197
- Sam. You'll be fine here.

434
00:28:51.197 --> 00:28:52.564
Sienna. I'll come with you.

435
00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.233
- Stay here. I got this.

436
00:28:58.004 --> 00:29:00.272
(Sam sighs)

437
00:29:02.374 --> 00:29:05.144
(walkie crackles)

438
00:29:14.887 --> 00:29:16.188
- [Woman] Hello?

439
00:29:17.723 --> 00:29:19.325
Can anyone hear me?

440
00:29:21.327 --> 00:29:22.128
- Hello?

441
00:29:24.831 --> 00:29:25.965
- [Woman] I'm upstairs.

442
00:29:27.033 --> 00:29:27.834
- Oh God.

443
00:29:29.168 --> 00:29:30.202
you're alive.

444
00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:32.704
- [Woman] Wait a second.

445
00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:35.507
- What is it?

446
00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:37.910
(door opens)

447
00:29:39.411 --> 00:29:42.815
(soft suspenseful music)

448
00:29:49.956 --> 00:29:52.291
- Look. I've been waiting
upstairs in one of the bedrooms.

449
00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:54.126
which is gross. by the way.

450
00:29:55.694 --> 00:29:58.497
I think I just found
a way to escape.

451
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:02.568
There's this door that seems
to lead to the car park.

452
00:30:02.601 --> 00:30:04.036
- No. stay put!

453
00:30:04.036 --> 00:30:05.972
One of the other girls went
out there. and a T-Rex came out

454
00:30:06.005 --> 00:30:08.207
of nowhere and got her.

455
00:30:08.207 --> 00:30:10.910
- Well. I either wait
up here like bait.

456
00:30:10.977 --> 00:30:13.079
or I take my chances
and I get out of here.

457
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.649
Look. I've got my keys.
all I need to do is get

458
00:30:17.683 --> 00:30:21.253
to the bottom of the
stairs. and if I'm careful.

459
00:30:21.253 --> 00:30:23.990
I can make my way across to
my car and get out of here.

460
00:30:25.591 --> 00:30:28.194
I need your help. where are you?

461
00:30:28.194 --> 00:30:29.996
Please. help me.

462
00:30:34.133 --> 00:30:36.735
- [Zara] Right? Now. I
feel like a sitting duck.

463
00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:37.970
No. we need to do something.

464
00:30:38.004 --> 00:30:39.405
and we need to do
something soon.

465
00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:42.808
(Sam sighs)

466
00:30:45.444 --> 00:30:46.645
- Kids. listen!

467
00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:48.647
Kids?

468
00:30:50.116 --> 00:30:52.318
No. no. no. no. no. no. no!

469
00:30:53.719 --> 00:30:55.454
- [Maddie] Come back!

470
00:31:01.994 --> 00:31:05.397
(slow suspenseful music)

471
00:31:11.003 --> 00:31:14.073
(pterodactyl growls)

472
00:31:17.043 --> 00:31:19.078
(Maddie gasps)

473
00:31:19.111 --> 00:31:22.481
(pterodactyl growls)

474
00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:24.050
- [Maddie] Help me!

475
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.556
(birds chitter)

476
00:31:38.164 --> 00:31:41.567
(soft suspenseful music)

477
00:31:58.884 --> 00:32:01.687
- [Robot] You are currently
in the danger zone.

478
00:32:01.687 --> 00:32:04.656
I suggest if you wish to
continue playing the game.

479
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.892
you return inside the building.

480
00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:08.927
- Oh. no. You tricked me
once into getting here.

481
00:32:08.961 --> 00:32:10.496
You're not going
to trick me again.

482
00:32:10.496 --> 00:32:13.665
- [Robot] It is not a
trick. just a suggestion.

483
00:32:13.732 --> 00:32:16.835
I'm allowed to suggest
hints to all players.

484
00:32:19.205 --> 00:32:21.907
(water dripping)

485
00:32:25.411 --> 00:32:28.814
(soft suspenseful music)

486
00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:45.597
(pterodactyl cries)

487
00:32:47.533 --> 00:32:50.536
(pterodactyl cries)

488
00:32:52.771 --> 00:32:54.473
- Is the coast clear?

489
00:32:59.445 --> 00:33:02.014
(woman panting)

490
00:33:07.186 --> 00:33:09.855
(woman panting)

491
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.026
(woman panting)

492
00:33:22.468 --> 00:33:23.835
No!

493
00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:24.836
No. come on!

494
00:33:25.804 --> 00:33:26.605
Come on!

495
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.408
What the hell?

496
00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:33.312
(woman cries)

497
00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:37.349
- [Robot] I warned you.

498
00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:38.750
- What did you do to my car?

499
00:33:39.685 --> 00:33:40.786
- [Robot] Cars are prohibited

500
00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:43.455
in helping a contestant
leave the game.

501
00:33:43.455 --> 00:33:45.424
As is any outside communication.

502
00:33:45.424 --> 00:33:47.926
- No. that was not
a part of the deal.

503
00:33:47.926 --> 00:33:49.695
- [Robot] A contestant.
once in the game.

504
00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:53.632
cannot leave the game until
the game has come to it's end.

505
00:33:55.634 --> 00:33:58.237
(robot putters)

506
00:33:59.405 --> 00:34:02.208
You have 16 hours
remaining. of the game.

507
00:34:04.643 --> 00:34:07.479
(T-Rex growls)

508
00:34:07.479 --> 00:34:08.647
- What was that?

509
00:34:08.647 --> 00:34:11.283
- [Robot] You are
within the danger zones.

510
00:34:11.317 --> 00:34:13.885
Its feeding time. I warned you.

511
00:34:15.754 --> 00:34:17.856
- Get back in the house!

512
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.690
Get back in the house!

513
00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:24.096
(woman sighs)

514
00:34:25.164 --> 00:34:27.933
(woman whimpers)

515
00:34:29.568 --> 00:34:32.271
(woman whimpers)

516
00:34:34.473 --> 00:34:39.110
- [Sienna] Get back in the
house. get back in the house!

517
00:34:42.047 --> 00:34:44.516
(woman cries)

518
00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:51.690
(T-Rex growls)

519
00:34:51.723 --> 00:34:54.193
(woman cries)

520
00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:04.002
- Help me. Please help.

521
00:35:04.002 --> 00:35:07.639
(intense dramatic music)

522
00:35:07.673 --> 00:35:10.176
(woman cries)

523
00:35:12.344 --> 00:35:15.281
(soft eerie music)

524
00:35:22.521 --> 00:35:25.824
(lingering eerie music)

525
00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:39.571
- Do you think this is what
the robot was talking about

526
00:35:39.605 --> 00:35:41.106
to help us survive this?

527
00:35:41.106 --> 00:35:42.841
- [Sam] Pass it here.

528
00:35:45.444 --> 00:35:46.745
Hello? Hello?

529
00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:50.282
Could anyone offer us any help?

530
00:35:50.282 --> 00:35:53.952
Hello? We need some assistance.

531
00:35:55.954 --> 00:35:59.358
(soft suspenseful music)

532
00:36:04.596 --> 00:36:06.932
- Sienna. the cars don't work.

533
00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:10.035
We can't get out of the
game until it's over.

534
00:36:12.204 --> 00:36:13.672
I'm heading back to the house.

535
00:36:15.807 --> 00:36:18.910
(heavy suspenseful music)

536
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.480
(door rattles)

537
00:36:23.148 --> 00:36:24.416
The door's locked.

538
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.451
I can't get in.

539
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:31.923
Sienna she's here.

540
00:36:34.726 --> 00:36:35.561
What should I do?

541
00:36:36.995 --> 00:36:38.196
- Tell her to go round the
back and meet me there.

542
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:41.933
(frenzied suspenseful music)

543
00:36:45.804 --> 00:36:48.440
(T-Rex roars)

544
00:36:48.474 --> 00:36:51.310
(Maddie gasps)

545
00:36:51.377 --> 00:36:53.512
(T-Rex roars)
- Stay there.

546
00:36:53.512 --> 00:36:56.415
(woman shushes)

547
00:36:56.448 --> 00:36:59.050
(T-Rex growls)

548
00:37:02.888 --> 00:37:05.357
(T-Rex roars)

549
00:37:08.126 --> 00:37:10.762
(raptor growls)

550
00:37:15.634 --> 00:37:18.169
(raptor growls)

551
00:37:18.203 --> 00:37:21.239
(door shakes)
(Sam mutters)

552
00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:23.875
(raptor growls)

553
00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:27.078
- It's back.

554
00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:31.517
- Please protect my daughter.

555
00:37:32.518 --> 00:37:33.319
Please.

556
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:40.191
(T-Rex growls)

557
00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:45.196
- Go. go round back
quickly. quickly.

558
00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:47.999
As fast as you can.
fast as you can.

559
00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:50.001
Fast as you can.

560
00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:52.471
(woman cries)

561
00:37:54.673 --> 00:37:57.409
(woman whimpers)

562
00:37:58.444 --> 00:38:01.447
(woman cries)

563
00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.115
(woman screams)

564
00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:07.853
- Maddie the stairwell!

565
00:38:08.687 --> 00:38:09.855
Meet me there!

566
00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:16.828
(intense dramatic music)

567
00:38:17.763 --> 00:38:18.997
Maddie. Maddie!

568
00:38:20.366 --> 00:38:21.600
Maddie come on!

569
00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:27.673
(Maddie screams)

570
00:38:27.706 --> 00:38:30.308
(alarm blares)

571
00:38:31.677 --> 00:38:32.478
Run!

572
00:38:32.511 --> 00:38:33.311
Run!

573
00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:36.948
(raptor growls)

574
00:38:40.352 --> 00:38:41.653
(door opens)

575
00:38:41.687 --> 00:38:44.255
(raptor roars)

576
00:38:48.494 --> 00:38:51.129
(raptor growls)

577
00:38:54.966 --> 00:38:57.569
(raptor roars)

578
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:01.873
(raptor growls)

579
00:39:02.874 --> 00:39:05.511
(raptor growls)

580
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.730
(raptor roars)

581
00:39:32.003 --> 00:39:35.641
(intense suspenseful music)

582
00:39:51.457 --> 00:39:54.092
(gun cocks)

583
00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:56.762
(raptor growls)

584
00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:01.967
- Hey!

585
00:40:02.868 --> 00:40:04.736
(raptor growls)

586
00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:09.775
(gun fires)
(raptor growls)

587
00:40:14.312 --> 00:40:16.915
We need to think how we're
going to get out of here.

588
00:40:17.816 --> 00:40:19.350
- You can't. it's a game.

589
00:40:20.285 --> 00:40:21.352
We play to the finish.

590
00:40:22.521 --> 00:40:23.989
- But there must be
a way out of here.

591
00:40:24.055 --> 00:40:26.191
I mean. surely we can just
walk through front gate.

592
00:40:26.191 --> 00:40:28.694
- We're locked in. The
only way out is by foot.

593
00:40:28.727 --> 00:40:30.395
and it's a killing
zone out there.

594
00:40:31.797 --> 00:40:33.999
- How did they even
get the things in here?

595
00:40:33.999 --> 00:40:37.335
Like. come on. Surely it's a
fucking hologram or something.

596
00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:39.638
- It's exactly what we
think it is. It is real.

597
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.510
And the sooner we
realize and accept that.

598
00:40:44.576 --> 00:40:46.411
The better chance
we have of survival.

599
00:40:49.014 --> 00:40:50.215
There's only us left now.

600
00:40:51.683 --> 00:40:54.486
And going by the time we have
approximately six hours left

601
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.487
until sunrise.

602
00:40:56.588 --> 00:40:58.590
Then it's all finally over.

603
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:01.092
- That thing. the robot.

604
00:41:01.126 --> 00:41:03.128
That made a point of
saying only one of us

605
00:41:03.161 --> 00:41:04.563
will make the finale.

606
00:41:04.563 --> 00:41:07.566
- What's to say we all
can't make the finale?

607
00:41:07.566 --> 00:41:08.734
We can do this. surely.

608
00:41:12.037 --> 00:41:14.806
Maddie. where did you
last see your brother?

609
00:41:14.806 --> 00:41:17.843
- He was out in the woods.
looking for the dinosaur.

610
00:41:17.876 --> 00:41:21.412
And he thought it was cool so
he wanted to see it up close.

611
00:41:21.446 --> 00:41:23.048
- What kind of dinosaur was it?

612
00:41:23.048 --> 00:41:26.184
- [Maddie] The one
you all saw earlier.

613
00:41:26.184 --> 00:41:27.586
- [Sienna] Did it look scary?

614
00:41:27.653 --> 00:41:29.087
- [Maddie] No.

615
00:41:29.087 --> 00:41:29.888
- Okay.

616
00:41:31.657 --> 00:41:34.025
Okay. how long were
you in the woods for?

617
00:41:34.092 --> 00:41:37.128
- A while. but I got
scared and I came back.

618
00:41:37.162 --> 00:41:39.531
- Scared? What happened?

619
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:43.368
- We kept hearing noises like
something was following us.

620
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:47.238
- A Raptor. That's what
followed you back here.

621
00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:02.854
- I need a minute.

622
00:42:09.561 --> 00:42:12.631
(sullen piano music)

623
00:42:25.844 --> 00:42:28.647
(bottle clatters)

624
00:42:28.647 --> 00:42:31.249
(gun clatters)

625
00:42:32.217 --> 00:42:33.885
- What you thinking?

626
00:42:36.154 --> 00:42:38.189
- I've got to get my boy.

627
00:42:40.726 --> 00:42:44.362
It's been too long. I can't
wait for him to get back.

628
00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:45.697
- You can't go out there.

629
00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:51.236
- Your gun.

630
00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:54.906
Give it to me!

631
00:42:54.973 --> 00:42:56.642
- Sienna. it's not
safe out there.

632
00:42:56.642 --> 00:42:58.243
especially when it's dark.

633
00:42:59.477 --> 00:43:01.446
Them woods are going
to be like a maze.

634
00:43:01.446 --> 00:43:03.048
You might not find
your way back.

635
00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:06.852
- You look after
my girl. all right?

636
00:43:06.885 --> 00:43:08.286
And no matter what happens.

637
00:43:08.286 --> 00:43:10.689
you do not let her leave
this place until I come back.

638
00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:13.892
- Yeah. and what if
you don't come back?

639
00:43:16.762 --> 00:43:18.329
- I will come back.

640
00:43:19.998 --> 00:43:21.166
- No. don't go.

641
00:43:22.734 --> 00:43:23.601
- Oh. Maddie.

642
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:26.672
Honey. you've got
nothing to worry about.

643
00:43:26.672 --> 00:43:29.474
Okay? It's going to be okay.

644
00:43:29.507 --> 00:43:31.810
But you brother has
been out in the woods

645
00:43:31.843 --> 00:43:33.611
for a few hours now
and he hasn't managed

646
00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:34.713
to find his way back.

647
00:43:36.114 --> 00:43:37.949
I'm just going to go out there.
find him and bring him back.

648
00:43:38.016 --> 00:43:39.084
That's all. Okay?

649
00:43:44.255 --> 00:43:46.357
No more tears. it's all right.

650
00:43:48.526 --> 00:43:49.995
- What if I lose you?

651
00:43:51.797 --> 00:43:54.599
- You're never going to lose
me. I'm not going anywhere.

652
00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.439
- But what about
what happened to Dad?

653
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.642
- This is nothing like
what happened to Dad.

654
00:44:04.676 --> 00:44:06.912
I'm never. ever going
to leave your side.

655
00:44:07.846 --> 00:44:09.848
You can't compare this to Dad.

656
00:44:09.881 --> 00:44:11.917
nothing could have stopped
what happened to him.

657
00:44:11.917 --> 00:44:15.453
But I can prevent us
from losing this game.

658
00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:16.888
I just need you to be
stronger than ever.

659
00:44:16.888 --> 00:44:18.189
and we'll get through this.

660
00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:24.129
So please. be a brave
girl. Just stay with Zara.

661
00:44:24.763 --> 00:44:25.330
Do as she says.

662
00:44:26.798 --> 00:44:31.803
And I'll be in no time. okay?

663
00:44:33.204 --> 00:44:36.274
(somber piano music)

664
00:44:46.451 --> 00:44:47.252
All right.

665
00:44:47.285 --> 00:44:48.653
I'll scout in the woods.

666
00:44:48.653 --> 00:44:49.755
I'll be back soon.

667
00:44:51.189 --> 00:44:53.725
- We'll stay close to the
door to let you back in.

668
00:44:53.725 --> 00:44:55.927
- Just be careful. okay?

669
00:44:55.961 --> 00:44:57.295
- I will. don't worry.

670
00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:01.833
I'll see you soon.

671
00:45:01.867 --> 00:45:03.334
- See you soon.

672
00:45:03.368 --> 00:45:04.870
- Don't forget this.

673
00:45:08.006 --> 00:45:09.440
Keep us updated. okay?

674
00:45:26.925 --> 00:45:29.995
(dark ominous music)

675
00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:48.313
(birds chatter)

676
00:46:13.238 --> 00:46:14.505
- Try to stop
worrying about her.

677
00:46:14.572 --> 00:46:16.241
I think she's going to be fine.

678
00:46:17.208 --> 00:46:18.209
Can you sit down?

679
00:46:18.209 --> 00:46:19.010
- Sam.

680
00:46:22.747 --> 00:46:25.650
How can you say that? How
can you be so confident?

681
00:46:25.683 --> 00:46:27.052
- Well. she has a gun.

682
00:46:27.052 --> 00:46:28.753
She's got some more protection
than the others had.

683
00:46:28.753 --> 00:46:30.956
- Wow. And if that
huge T-Rex comes back?

684
00:46:30.956 --> 00:46:33.591
What. that's going to be
held off by a fucking rifle?

685
00:46:38.129 --> 00:46:40.798
I'm sorry Sam. but
you have been here.

686
00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:43.368
The whole thing is a
complete setup. It's a trap.

687
00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:46.071
Nothing is what it seems to be.

688
00:46:47.238 --> 00:46:49.307
We need to remember that.

689
00:46:50.808 --> 00:46:53.344
(bird chatter)

690
00:46:56.915 --> 00:47:00.685
(lingering suspenseful music)

691
00:47:02.053 --> 00:47:04.455
(door opens)

692
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.159
(door closes)

693
00:47:09.895 --> 00:47:12.297
(Zara sighs)

694
00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:16.868
(loud crash)

695
00:47:16.935 --> 00:47:18.236
- What was that?

696
00:47:20.105 --> 00:47:20.906
- Stay here!

697
00:47:22.107 --> 00:47:23.108
- Can't be another one
of those things. surely.

698
00:47:23.174 --> 00:47:24.976
How would it get in?

699
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:26.444
- Just stay here.

700
00:47:37.455 --> 00:47:39.824
(Zara gasps)

701
00:47:42.928 --> 00:47:46.731
(lingering suspenseful music)

702
00:48:06.117 --> 00:48:08.519
(wind blows)

703
00:48:27.872 --> 00:48:31.276
(soft suspenseful music)

704
00:48:42.954 --> 00:48:46.357
(soft suspenseful music)

705
00:48:50.128 --> 00:48:51.529
- [Sienna] Peter!

706
00:48:53.831 --> 00:48:54.632
Peter!

707
00:49:04.909 --> 00:49:08.313
(soft suspenseful music)

708
00:49:13.651 --> 00:49:17.055
(soft suspenseful music)

709
00:49:48.486 --> 00:49:50.755
(door clicks)
(door chimes)

710
00:49:50.755 --> 00:49:53.158
(door opens)

711
00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:57.795
(dark ominous music)

712
00:50:15.646 --> 00:50:19.217
- [Maddie] Why did all
the doors just open?

713
00:50:20.685 --> 00:50:23.321
(raptor growls)

714
00:50:24.389 --> 00:50:26.391
(raptor roars)

715
00:50:26.391 --> 00:50:28.759

Peter!

724
00:51:35.293 --> 00:51:37.195

- Peter. where are you?

726
00:51:40.631 --> 00:51:42.032
I can't find you!

727
00:51:43.368 --> 00:51:45.870
- [Peter] Follow my voice. Mom!

728
00:51:47.572 --> 00:51:48.373
Mom!

729
00:51:55.246 --> 00:51:58.449

730
00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.486
- Yes. we're here.

731
00:52:01.486 --> 00:52:02.287
- Mom.

732
00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:10.561

- Maddie. you've
got to keep moving.

752
00:54:11.882 --> 00:54:12.683
- No.

753
00:54:15.453 --> 00:54:19.390
- We've got to get out of
here or it will find us.

754
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:20.391
Okay?

755
00:54:20.391 --> 00:54:22.927

Okay?

758
00:54:31.235 --> 00:54:33.704
That door over there.

get through to the next room.

(raptor roars)

761
00:54:40.345 --> 00:54:42.813
You go first. and
I'll cover you.

762
00:54:44.081 --> 00:54:44.949
- I'm scared.

763
00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:49.119
- I'll distract
it. if it sees you.

764
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:51.922
Okay?

765
00:54:52.757 --> 00:54:54.325
And you don't stop.

766
00:54:55.693 --> 00:54:58.963
You get to that door and
then you keep moving.

776
00:55:42.773 --> 00:55:45.810
(Sienna gasps)
Peter!

777
00:55:51.015 --> 00:55:52.016
I found you.

(cupboard squeaks)

789
00:56:44.034 --> 00:56:44.835
- No!

790
00:56:48.005 --> 00:56:50.641
(raptor growls)

791
00:56:53.043 --> 00:56:58.048
(Maddie screams)
(raptor roars)

792
00:57:01.486 --> 00:57:03.488
- I'm sorry I ran off.

793
00:57:03.521 --> 00:57:05.456
- It's fine. it's fine.

794
00:57:05.456 --> 00:57:07.625
You're back with me now.
and that's all that matters.

795
00:57:07.692 --> 00:57:08.893
We just got to get
back to the house.

796
00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:11.028
and wait for this
all to be over.

797
00:57:13.564 --> 00:57:17.001
- I got lost. I couldn't
find the way back.

798
00:57:17.001 --> 00:57:19.870
- I think I figured out
the way back. all right?

799
00:57:21.405 --> 00:57:22.807
- Thought this was a game?

800
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:26.043
- It is.

801
00:57:26.076 --> 00:57:28.813
It's some twisted game
of life and death.

802
00:57:28.846 --> 00:57:29.647
Let's go.

803
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:40.691
- Mom?

804
00:57:40.725 --> 00:57:42.226
- [Sienna] Maddie.
can you put Sam on?

805
00:57:42.226 --> 00:57:44.028
- She's gone a dinosaur ate her.

806
00:57:44.028 --> 00:57:45.963
- [Sienna] What do
you mean she's gone.

807
00:57:45.963 --> 00:57:47.965
What happened? You
were safe inside.

808
00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:51.468
- One of the dinosaurs
came in and it was one

809
00:57:51.536 --> 00:57:53.470
of the shorter ones
and it got her.

810
00:57:55.573 --> 00:57:57.374
- [Sienna] Is Zara with you?

811
00:57:57.374 --> 00:57:58.776
- She's upstairs.

812
00:57:58.776 --> 00:58:00.645
- [Sienna] Okay. and
where are you right now?

813
00:58:00.645 --> 00:58:02.412
- I'm hiding in a cupboard.

814
00:58:02.446 --> 00:58:04.849
but it's out there
waiting for me.

815
00:58:04.882 --> 00:58:06.283
- [Sienna] Right.
okay. stay there.

816
00:58:06.283 --> 00:58:09.053
I'm coming in to get
you. I have Peter.

817
00:58:09.053 --> 00:58:10.454
I'll be right with you. okay?

818
00:58:11.522 --> 00:58:13.558
- I think it's safe now.

819
00:58:13.591 --> 00:58:15.192
- [Sienna] Just stay put.

820
00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:17.828
- Be careful. Mom.

821
00:58:17.895 --> 00:58:20.665
- [Sienna] I will do. Love
you. I'll be right there.

822
00:58:20.731 --> 00:58:22.132
- I love you too.

823
00:58:24.068 --> 00:58:26.270
(heavy ominous music)

824
00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.673
- [Zara] Some good choices
in the mix this time.

825
00:58:30.641 --> 00:58:33.177
(siren blares)

826
00:58:33.177 --> 00:58:35.345
Another one down?

827
00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:39.149
- [Robot] Contestant
Samantha has lost her life.

828
00:58:39.216 --> 00:58:40.651
- Aw...
Oh!

829
00:58:40.685 --> 00:58:43.120
Does that mean we get to
crown the winner now. then?

830
00:58:44.722 --> 00:58:46.657
- There's still three left.

831
00:58:46.657 --> 00:58:48.525
- And you want to make
the last three fight

832
00:58:48.525 --> 00:58:49.960
it out amongst their selves.

833
00:58:49.994 --> 00:58:53.363
Oh. you're nasty...

834
00:58:53.363 --> 00:58:54.198
and I love it.

835
00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:57.401
- You did say they'd
want to reach the finals.

836
00:58:57.401 --> 00:58:59.003
You were right.

837
00:58:59.003 --> 00:59:00.404
- I know.

838
00:59:00.404 --> 00:59:03.073
Christ. I didn't think
it would be Laura.

839
00:59:03.107 --> 00:59:05.375
She was the first one
out. so I win this one.

840
00:59:06.577 --> 00:59:09.714
- Not just yet.
still three to go.

841
00:59:09.714 --> 00:59:10.615
Place your bets.

842
00:59:13.684 --> 00:59:15.720
- I think the mom will cave.

843
00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.888
Saving her kids in
a mighty show down.

844
00:59:18.756 --> 00:59:21.959
Now the boy he's got guts.

845
00:59:21.992 --> 00:59:23.093
He's our winner.

846
00:59:23.127 --> 00:59:23.928
You?

847
00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:26.797
- I think the mom will win.

848
00:59:28.165 --> 00:59:31.001
She won't want to lose
her life. or lose.

849
00:59:31.001 --> 00:59:33.537
- Never doubt a mother's love.

850
00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:35.072
- It was good plan. by the way.

851
00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:36.874
Leaving them back
there on their own.

852
00:59:36.907 --> 00:59:38.976
- And good plan to you.
for opening all the doors

853
00:59:39.009 --> 00:59:40.244
to this place. cheeky.

854
00:59:42.279 --> 00:59:44.414
- Just wanted to spice
things up a little.

855
00:59:45.716 --> 00:59:47.451
- Well I thought. when
I separate from them

856
00:59:47.484 --> 00:59:49.687
it might up the
stakes a little bit.

857
00:59:49.687 --> 00:59:51.488
Make me even more
unquestionable.

858
00:59:52.923 --> 00:59:55.125
- Do you think they have
their suspicions about you?

859
00:59:58.228 --> 01:00:01.031
- Maybe Sam. she
questioned me to death

860
01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:04.168
in the kitchen early about
what I knew about the game.

861
01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:05.602
I had to make it believable.

862
01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:10.474
- Get back down there
and get the game going.

863
01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:12.209
We've only got an
hour til sunrise.

864
01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.511
Make it good.

865
01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:15.545
- Of course.

866
01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:29.193

(cupboard opens)

886
01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.047
- Hey. hey. come with me.

887
01:01:58.248 --> 01:02:00.317
- Mommy said I have
to stay hidden.

888
01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:01.952
and she's going to come get me.

889
01:02:01.986 --> 01:02:04.321
- Yeah. but Mommy told
me to come get you.

890
01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:05.322
- She did?

891
01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:08.125
- Yeah. I was just with her.

892
01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:10.795
Come on. I'll take
you somewhere safe.

893
01:02:10.828 --> 01:02:12.362
- When will this be over?

894
01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:17.001
- 10 minutes. and then
it'll all be done. Okay?

895
01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:18.803
I promise. Good girl. Come on.

896
01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:22.306
Hey. can I borrow this?

897
01:02:23.607 --> 01:02:25.309
Won't be needing that
where you're going.

898
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:26.276
- Hmm?

899
01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:27.744
- Hmm?

900
01:02:27.812 --> 01:02:30.480
Oh. nothing. honey. I just
said we'd better get going.

901
01:02:33.283 --> 01:02:37.087
Do you know what. I think it's
much safer if you stay here.

902
01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.688
Just while I go get Mom.

903
01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:39.957
- Can I come with you?

904
01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:45.896
(raptor growls)

905
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:47.965
- You still have company.

906
01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:50.434
(door closes)

907
01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:54.104
(raptor growls)

908
01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:59.409
(soft suspenseful music)

909
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:28.605
(Peter sniffles)

910
01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:32.877
- [Sienna] Come on. Quickly.

911
01:03:32.877 --> 01:03:37.882
(Sienna shushes)
(Peter sniffles)

912
01:03:40.684 --> 01:03:44.088
(soft suspenseful music)

913
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:03.040
(Sienna gasps)

914
01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:05.642
- [Robot] Congratulations!

915
01:04:05.642 --> 01:04:08.245
With just 20 minutes
left of the game.

916
01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:10.881
you are the last
three contestants

917
01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:13.550
- What do you mean. there's
only me and Zara left?

918
01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:17.254
- [Robot] Yourself and
the children. Good luck.

919
01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.256
- What. no the children
aren't playing!

920
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.026
- [Robot] As instructed earlier.

921
01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:26.130
whoever stepped inside
agreed to being involved.

922
01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:29.934
Now for a challenge.
You have five seconds.

923
01:04:29.934 --> 01:04:32.136
before I shall call...
- Stop it!

924
01:04:32.136 --> 01:04:34.038
[Robot] Attention.
(gun clicks)

925
01:04:34.038 --> 01:04:36.640
- [Robot] In five. four.
(raptor growls)

926
01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:37.474
three.

927
01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:40.410
two.

928
01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:41.645
one.

929
01:04:41.645 --> 01:04:42.947
- Look. you're going
to be okay. let's go.

930
01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:46.150
(siren blares)

931
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:49.920
(intense suspenseful music)

932
01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:54.124
- [Peter] What do we do?

933
01:05:05.769 --> 01:05:08.772
- We can't get out.
Quickly. quickly.

934
01:05:08.772 --> 01:05:10.007
This whole thing is a trap.

935
01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:12.209
and they do not want
us to survive. okay?

936
01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:16.480
Get under the bed. quickly.
and don't make a sound.

937
01:05:22.186 --> 01:05:25.589
(soft suspenseful music)

938
01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.626

959
01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:06.656

961

962
01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.936
(door opens)

963
01:07:29.012 --> 01:07:30.514
- You both are okay.

964
01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:34.118
- Oh God. I thought
you were done for.

965
01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:38.888
We've got to watch out. there's
raptors inside the house.

966
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:43.493
Wait. I thought you were dead.

967
01:07:43.527 --> 01:07:46.630
- Yeah. I had a few
close encounters. but
I'm fine. luckily.

968
01:07:48.165 --> 01:07:51.268
- But the robot it said
there was there of us left.

969
01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:55.038
- Yeah. Sam will be
round here somewhere.

970
01:07:55.038 --> 01:07:57.707
It got crazy earlier.
we had to separate.

971
01:07:57.774 --> 01:08:02.146
- No. he said the three of
us. myself and the kids.

972
01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:05.249
Why didn't it count you?

973
01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.124
(raptor growls)

974
01:08:14.124 --> 01:08:16.326

976
01:08:23.267 --> 01:08:25.934
(raptor growls)

977
01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:27.171
Maddie!

978
01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.805
- You weren't supposed
to figure that out.

979
01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:31.175
Clever girl. there.

980
01:08:31.175 --> 01:08:34.310
- What the hell
is going on here?

981
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.681
(raptor growls)

982
01:08:37.681 --> 01:08:40.317
(raptor growls)

983
01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:44.288
(raptor roars)

984
01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:48.825
- What do you think
is going on. Sienna?

985
01:08:50.594 --> 01:08:54.264
Your in a game. and only
the fittest survive.

986
01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:57.467
- Get out of my way.

987
01:08:57.467 --> 01:09:00.370
- Maddie's in there with
a little friend of mine.

988
01:09:00.404 --> 01:09:02.238
So let's see if she
has what it takes.

989
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.875
My clock says there's
only 10 minutes left.

990
01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:08.344
and then we need to
crown just one survivor.

991
01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:13.282
- Get out of my way!

992
01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:16.920
- Don't tempt me.

993
01:09:18.522 --> 01:09:20.657
- Why are you doing this?

994
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:22.226
- Because it's fun.

995
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.796
Peter. Peter. Peter.

996
01:09:28.565 --> 01:09:30.800
Really soon. me
and you are going

997
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.636
to have something in common.

998
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.271
Yeah.

999
01:09:34.271 --> 01:09:36.273
I watched my mom die. too.

1000
01:09:36.273 --> 01:09:37.407

(robot putters)

1002
01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:45.113
- [Robot] That is
against the rules.

1003
01:09:45.113 --> 01:09:47.050
The only way a
winner can be crowned

1004
01:09:47.083 --> 01:09:50.353
is by surviving the
hotel's obstacles.

1005
01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:53.056
Human interference
is not prohibited.

1006
01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:56.925
- I make up the rules.

1007
01:09:56.925 --> 01:10:00.029
- [Robot] The rules were
set before the game began.

1008
01:10:00.096 --> 01:10:02.130
This was not one of them.

1009
01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:13.209
(Sienna grunts)
(Zara grunts)

1010
01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:14.278
- Good shot!

1011
01:10:18.282 --> 01:10:20.148
- Who the hell are you?

1012
01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:24.487
- The Games Master.

1013
01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:27.591
How are you finding it. being
one of the lucky finalists?

1014
01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:32.329
Looks like you got one
more obstacle to overcome.

1015
01:10:33.397 --> 01:10:35.130
This is going to be a good one.

1016
01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:40.969
(Sienna grunts)

1017
01:10:40.969 --> 01:10:42.806

(Zara pants)

1022
01:11:06.696 --> 01:11:11.668
- First one I get to
take out on my own.

1023

(raptor growls)

1031
01:11:48.505 --> 01:11:50.273
- Whoa. not so fast!

1032
01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:52.675
Still a couple of
minutes on the clock.

1033
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:54.511
- Kids get in the car.

1034
01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:57.447
- [Games Master] I must say
you really surprise me there.

1035
01:11:57.447 --> 01:11:59.549
Never thought you had it in you.

1036
01:11:59.616 --> 01:12:02.886
You surprised me. I
guess she was right.

1037
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.889
Never cross a mother's love.

1038
01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:09.025
- What is this. huh?

1039
01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.628
What the hell is this?

1040
01:12:13.129 --> 01:12:16.766
Some sick game for
your entertainment?

1041
01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:19.168
- I guess you could
say that. yes.

1042
01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:22.305
Would've been wonderful.
the ultimate death match.

1043
01:12:23.507 --> 01:12:25.442
Man versus dinosaur.

1044
01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:27.677
- You're sick.

1045
01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:32.081
- Me and many. many
more. Believe it.

1046
01:12:33.483 --> 01:12:35.952
Do you think I'm the
only one watching?

1047
01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:37.487
This place rigged with cameras.

1048
01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:40.356
People pay a pretty dollar.

1049
01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:44.693
just to have the
privilege to watch in.

1050
01:12:44.728 --> 01:12:45.728
Bets are placed.

1051
01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:49.833
Think of it as your
local gambling show.

1052
01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:53.603
Just live and hidden.

1053
01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.776
- One minute left on the clock.

1054
01:12:59.776 --> 01:13:01.077
- Not to mention. the millions

1055
01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:04.313
of pounds that
people have invested.

1056
01:13:04.347 --> 01:13:06.049
just for the outcome
of this game.

1057
01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:16.793
- [Robot] Welcome
to the final minute.

1058
01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:18.962
Only one will be
crowned the winner.

1059
01:13:24.601 --> 01:13:28.605
- She's coming. and I'll
tell you now. she's hungry.

1060
01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:35.111
As you were warned.

1061
01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.415
three of you remain
only one will win.

1062
01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.687
- [Robot] 45 seconds remaining.

1063

(T-Rex roars)

1064
01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:53.329
- Isn't she beautiful?

1065
01:14:00.737 --> 01:14:04.907
- I won.

1066
01:14:04.907 --> 01:14:07.410
You're part of this game. too.

1067
01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:10.146
Right?

1068
01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.618
(gun fires)
(Games Master yelps)

1069
01:14:14.618 --> 01:14:16.753
- Where did you find that?

1070
01:14:19.523 --> 01:14:21.925
You entered the house.
just like the rest of us.

1071
01:14:23.493 --> 01:14:25.562
You enter.
(T-Rex growls)

1072
01:14:25.562 --> 01:14:26.362
you play.

1073
01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:31.601
So say hi to her for me.

1074
