3
00:01:27.778 --> 00:01:30.580
- You made it.
- I did.

4
00:01:30.613 --> 00:01:33.583
- Hey.
- Hey.

5
00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:35.386
- Good to see you.
- You too.

6
00:01:37.387 --> 00:01:38.689
Erin. Alex.

7
00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:41.425
Alex. this is Erin.

8
00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:43.161
- Hey.
- Hi.

9
00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.165
Looking good out there. girl.

10
00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:49.834
Yeah. I know.

11
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.401
Uh. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna grab a beer.

12
00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:53.503
Did... did you want anything.
can I...?

13
00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:54.939
I don't drink.

14
00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:56.506
Well. how about a Coke?

15
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.741
They're free for me.

16
00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:00.478
Save your $5.

17
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:02.580
- You got it.
- I'll take a...

18
00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:05.715
Uh... okay.

19
00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:10.454
Hello. did you hear me?

20
00:02:10.486 --> 00:02:12.789
I got my final mark
on that major paper I wrote

21
00:02:12.823 --> 00:02:14.759
on Paradise Regained.

22
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:18.962
which I have now read
for the third time by the way.

23
00:02:18.996 --> 00:02:21.199
The fucking instructor

24
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:23.533
says that
my interpretation of Milton

25
00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:26.337
doesn't fully explain
his continuing role

26
00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:28.838
in Western literature.

27
00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:30.607
Dick.

28
00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:33.644
- What was your grade?
- A fucking minus.

29
00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:40.517
Oh. did she show. Erin?

30
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.954
What. does everybody
know this girl but me?

31
00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:45.323
Uh. no. I barely know her.

32
00:02:45.355 --> 00:02:46.967
She was in our
Philosophy of Literature class

33
00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:48.759
with me and Zack.

34
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:52.262
and I think
he kind of asked her out.

35
00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:53.630
Kind of?

36
00:02:53.664 --> 00:02:55.666
Well. I think he thinks he did.

37
00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:59.003
So. he's into her?

38
00:02:59.035 --> 00:03:01.838
Uh. well. she's a female.

39
00:03:01.872 --> 00:03:03.674
so yeah.

40
00:03:07.044 --> 00:03:09.680
Is she into him?

41
00:03:09.712 --> 00:03:11.581
- Hey. Jules.
- Oh. hey. how are you?

42
00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:14.684
Oh. she's devastated.
she got an A minus on a paper.

43
00:03:14.718 --> 00:03:16.354
Oh. buddy.

44
00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:18.656
Oh. shut it.

45
00:03:18.688 --> 00:03:21.458
You know.
I think I wanna go dance.

46
00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:23.694
Is there anybody
I can convince to join me?

47
00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:25.830
- Zack. let's go.
- Absolutely.

48
00:03:25.862 --> 00:03:28.565
Oh. yeah. go show me your moves.

49
00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.934
Yes. ma'am.

50
00:03:33.604 --> 00:03:35.806
You sure I can't tempt you?

51
00:03:35.838 --> 00:03:37.942
Uh. no.

52
00:03:37.974 --> 00:03:40.010
I mean. the table.

53
00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:42.313
I should watch the table.
I... I don't want someone

54
00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:43.781
to take it.

55
00:03:43.813 --> 00:03:45.849
No. we wouldn't want that.

56
00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:03.868
Hey. baby. what's going on?

57
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:05.368
Ow.

58
00:04:05.402 --> 00:04:08.005
Oh. you're a little feisty.
all right.

59
00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:09.674
Okay.

60
00:04:13.043 --> 00:04:14.645
What. it's just a little dance.

61
00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:17.714
- I'm a good dancer.
- Ugh. no. you're not.

62
00:04:41.037 --> 00:04:42.672
Hey.

63
00:04:42.705 --> 00:04:44.075
How's the table?

64
00:04:44.108 --> 00:04:46.677
Fine. I just wanted to
make sure you're okay.

65
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.945
Oh. yeah. just perils
of the dance floor.

66
00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.781
Did you come to dance with me?

67
00:04:50.813 --> 00:04:54.351
Uh. no. I don't think
I can keep up.

68
00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:57.587
I just... just wanted to
check you're okay. that's all.

69
00:04:57.621 --> 00:05:00.858
Well. you did. and I am.

70
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.659
Okay.

71
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:06.796
And now I need to be making sure

72
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.998
that you're okay.

73
00:05:09.032 --> 00:05:10.835
Jeez.

74
00:05:16.873 --> 00:05:19.976
Thank you.

75
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.546
Hey. uh. have a good night.
see you later.

76
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.849
Uh. wait.

77
00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:29.886
- What's up?
- Um. do you wanna

78
00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.722
share a cab or something?

79
00:05:31.755 --> 00:05:35.159
I live pretty close.
so I won't be catching a cab.

80
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:39.162
Um. do you wanna
share a sidewalk?

81
00:05:53.142 --> 00:05:55.546
Oh. shit.

82
00:05:55.578 --> 00:05:57.013
Ah. for fuck's sake!

83
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.820
This is fucked.

84
00:06:03.854 --> 00:06:06.022
- Good morning. sunshine.
- Julia.

85
00:06:06.056 --> 00:06:08.625
what the fuck?

86
00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.493
Don't take that tone with me.

87
00:06:10.527 --> 00:06:12.695
Beach. let's go.

88
00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.899
Dude. you literally
just woke me up.

89
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.200
I am not ready for the beach.
and it is really early

90
00:06:17.234 --> 00:06:18.868
for your cleavage.

91
00:06:18.902 --> 00:06:22.106
First off. it is not my fault
that you slept in.

92
00:06:22.138 --> 00:06:26.075
and secondly. it's never
too early for my cleavage.

93
00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:27.611
Let's go.

94
00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:31.981
God. I am so glad I went from

95
00:06:32.015 --> 00:06:33.784
a comfortable
laying-down position

96
00:06:33.816 --> 00:06:36.219
to an uncomfortable
laying-down position.

97
00:06:36.253 --> 00:06:38.823
Okay.

98
00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:43.127
Try to think of it
as full-body exfoliation.

99
00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.529
But. I'm more thinking
of it as a sunburn.

100
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:47.864
and sand in my crack.

101
00:06:47.897 --> 00:06:50.934
Are you ever happy
about anything?

102
00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:53.136
Hardly ever.

103
00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:54.904
Room for one more?

104
00:06:54.938 --> 00:06:56.873
- Oh. hi.
- Hi.

105
00:06:56.907 --> 00:06:58.709
Yeah. sure.

106
00:07:02.678 --> 00:07:04.582
I didn't know
you were joining us.

107
00:07:04.614 --> 00:07:06.783
- Is that all right?
- Absolutely.

108
00:07:06.816 --> 00:07:09.486
Of course.

109
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.690
Zack likes you.

110
00:07:12.722 --> 00:07:14.724
so you're stuck with us.

111
00:07:14.758 --> 00:07:16.226
Could be worse.

112
00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:23.500
I think I'm gonna go for a dip.

113
00:07:23.534 --> 00:07:25.002
Be right back.

114
00:07:27.104 --> 00:07:29.940
So. is she just.
like. our friend now?

115
00:07:29.972 --> 00:07:31.641
I don't know. why?

116
00:07:31.674 --> 00:07:34.044
You don't like her?

117
00:07:34.077 --> 00:07:35.813
No. I...

118
00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:37.748
I don't know her.

119
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.116
I mean. she seems nice.

120
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.753
She's polite.
and friendly. and...

121
00:07:42.786 --> 00:07:45.022
Alex. you don't
have to convince me.

122
00:07:45.054 --> 00:07:47.525
I don't care if you like her.

123
00:07:47.558 --> 00:07:49.260
I didn't say I didn't like her.

124
00:07:49.292 --> 00:07:51.995
Mhm.

125
00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:54.198
- Oh.
- Oh. thank you.

126
00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:10.314
Oh. no. I'm good. thank you.

127
00:08:10.347 --> 00:08:12.181
It's for me.

128
00:08:12.214 --> 00:08:14.084
If you don't mind?

129
00:08:14.116 --> 00:08:16.087
- Please?
- Oh. yeah.

130
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:20.858
Yeah.

131
00:09:14.144 --> 00:09:15.946
Oh. okay. well let's just
cover all the bases.

132
00:09:15.978 --> 00:09:18.081
No. none of us are into Zack.

133
00:09:18.115 --> 00:09:20.717
He's like
an annoying younger brother.

134
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.819
- Hm.
- But. you know.

135
00:09:22.852 --> 00:09:24.731
wouldn't be life without him.
though. don't tell him

136
00:09:24.755 --> 00:09:28.125
- I said that.
- Lips are sealed.

137
00:09:28.158 --> 00:09:30.728
So. is he not your type. or...?

138
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.262
I don't know. I haven't
really thought about it.

139
00:09:33.295 --> 00:09:35.765
What is your type?

140
00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:38.401
Confident. attractive. smart.

141
00:09:38.434 --> 00:09:39.969
How about you?

142
00:09:40.002 --> 00:09:42.038
You. generally.

143
00:09:42.072 --> 00:09:43.907
What?

144
00:09:43.939 --> 00:09:46.242
Oh. I mean.
same... same as... as you.

145
00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:48.746
Same as you said just...

146
00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:50.179
Oh. my God. are you okay?

147
00:09:50.212 --> 00:09:52.116
Yeah.

148
00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:55.184
- You're bleeding.
- Yeah.

149
00:09:55.217 --> 00:09:57.121
- Come on.
- No. that's okay.

150
00:09:57.154 --> 00:09:59.657
- Let me take care of it.
- It's totally fine.

151
00:09:59.689 --> 00:10:01.724
It's... yeah.

152
00:10:01.757 --> 00:10:03.726
Ow.

153
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.261
Have a seat.

154
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.737
Wow. this is
a real happening place. huh?

155
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.707
We're closed on Sundays.

156
00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:21.712
Have you worked here
for a long time?

157
00:10:21.745 --> 00:10:24.881
Uh. yeah.
we've had it for a while.

158
00:10:24.914 --> 00:10:27.351
- We?
- My family owns it.

159
00:10:29.452 --> 00:10:32.990
Guess I kind of own it.

160
00:10:33.023 --> 00:10:35.359
Oh.

161
00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:37.226
Wow.

162
00:10:39.962 --> 00:10:42.065
Yeah. my dad has this habit
of buying businesses.

163
00:10:42.098 --> 00:10:44.801
and he kind of left me
in charge of this one.

164
00:10:44.834 --> 00:10:46.469
so.

165
00:10:46.502 --> 00:10:48.438
Hey. that must be nice.

166
00:10:51.107 --> 00:10:53.309
Oh. I... well I didn't... I...

167
00:10:53.342 --> 00:10:56.112
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

168
00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:59.449
I just meant it must be nice.

169
00:10:59.482 --> 00:11:01.017
Yeah.

170
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.020
Yeah. it's as nice as
material things can be I guess.

171
00:11:05.489 --> 00:11:07.324
What do you mean?

172
00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:10.928
I mean that my dad
doesn't really get

173
00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:14.965
the whole feelings thing.
so he uses his money instead.

174
00:11:14.997 --> 00:11:17.400
But hey. it's not like I'm just
some complacent manager.

175
00:11:17.433 --> 00:11:19.770
I do actually work. you know.

176
00:11:21.837 --> 00:11:23.506
Okay.

177
00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:25.842
I mean. I wasn't
suggesting that you were.

178
00:11:29.913 --> 00:11:31.914
I think it's very cool

179
00:11:31.948 --> 00:11:34.918
that you're the boss.

180
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:37.755
- You think so?
- Yeah.

181
00:11:42.259 --> 00:11:44.327
How about you.
what's your story?

182
00:11:46.462 --> 00:11:49.900
Uh. it was just
me and my mom growing up.

183
00:11:49.933 --> 00:11:54.004
She worked a lot.
but she got the feelings thing.

184
00:11:54.036 --> 00:11:56.506
- Mhm.
- Sounds like you and me

185
00:11:56.539 --> 00:11:59.409
had completely opposite
childhoods.

186
00:12:10.986 --> 00:12:13.122
You know. he's not all bad.

187
00:12:13.155 --> 00:12:16.226
- Who. you're dad?
- Yeah.

188
00:12:16.259 --> 00:12:18.996
I'm not judging.

189
00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:22.399
Just laid my entire
life story out on you.

190
00:12:22.432 --> 00:12:24.433
Sorry about that.

191
00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:27.203
I guess that you're just sort of

192
00:12:27.236 --> 00:12:30.006
easy to talk to.

193
00:12:32.475 --> 00:12:35.445
How about you.
what happened to your dad?

194
00:12:35.477 --> 00:12:38.481
Uh. he left when I was 4.

195
00:12:40.549 --> 00:12:42.986
I didn't really know him.

196
00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:46.089
According to my mom.
that's a good thing.

197
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:48.424
You see your mom a lot?

198
00:12:48.457 --> 00:12:50.394
Uh. no.

199
00:12:50.427 --> 00:12:52.196
No. she. uh...

200
00:12:52.228 --> 00:12:55.331
she died.

201
00:12:55.365 --> 00:12:57.601
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:57.634 --> 00:13:00.938
Oh. it's okay.

203
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:02.840
I mean. it's not okay.

204
00:13:02.872 --> 00:13:05.908
but I'm fine.

205
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.916
There's this. uh...

206
00:13:12.948 --> 00:13:16.553
There's this spot
down by the beach

207
00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:18.087
that I like to go to.

208
00:13:20.055 --> 00:13:21.390
It reminds me of her.

209
00:13:31.167 --> 00:13:33.136
Let me see your arm.

210
00:13:33.169 --> 00:13:36.005
I think you got
some gravel in it or something.

211
00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:38.140
Yeah.

212
00:13:38.174 --> 00:13:40.086
It's okay. though.
just throw a Band-Aid on there

213
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.212
or something.

214
00:13:42.245 --> 00:13:44.414
- I'll be gentle.
- Okay.

215
00:13:52.923 --> 00:13:54.524
Are you ready?

216
00:13:54.557 --> 00:13:56.293
I don't know.

217
00:13:59.696 --> 00:14:02.199
That probably hurts.

218
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:04.601
All good.

219
00:14:14.611 --> 00:14:16.313
- Can you. um...?
- Oh.

220
00:14:51.614 --> 00:14:54.985
Does it feel better?

221
00:14:55.018 --> 00:14:57.087
Yeah.

222
00:14:59.688 --> 00:15:01.958
So. did I tell you
about my movie idea?

223
00:15:01.991 --> 00:15:03.269
- No.
- Yeah. I mean. so I'm writing

224
00:15:03.293 --> 00:15:06.263
this movie. and it's you and me
are the leads.

225
00:15:06.295 --> 00:15:10.166
and I play a character
named Robin Banks. okay?

226
00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:14.637
No. but wait.
you're Greta Waycar.

227
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.373
- You're dumb.
- No. it's genius.

228
00:15:19.342 --> 00:15:22.346
- Hey.
- Hey. Al.

229
00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:25.015
- Where's Erin?
- Ah. she had to work

230
00:15:25.048 --> 00:15:26.549
or something.

231
00:15:26.582 --> 00:15:30.120
Aw. I got her a Coke.

232
00:15:30.153 --> 00:15:32.356
Before you say anything.
it wasn't you.

233
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:34.057
I didn't scare her away?

234
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.160
- No. Zack.
- Thank God.

235
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.162
But. like.
what'd she say about me?

236
00:15:40.196 --> 00:15:43.133
- Oh. my God. get over yourself.
- What?

237
00:15:43.165 --> 00:15:44.667
I need to know.

238
00:15:44.701 --> 00:15:46.603
I don't know. nothing.

239
00:15:46.635 --> 00:15:48.237
Nothing?

240
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.573
At all?

241
00:15:50.606 --> 00:15:52.342
Really?

242
00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:55.111
No. no. I mean.

243
00:15:55.145 --> 00:15:56.413
you're a good guy or whatever.

244
00:15:56.446 --> 00:15:59.016
Just keep doing that.

245
00:15:59.049 --> 00:16:00.449
I don't know about that.

246
00:16:00.482 --> 00:16:02.752
Good guys finish last.

247
00:16:02.785 --> 00:16:06.323
Unless that's what she likes.

248
00:16:06.356 --> 00:16:09.056
I don't know what she likes.

249
00:16:09.058 --> 00:16:11.694
If you wanna ask her out.
just ask her out.

250
00:16:11.727 --> 00:16:15.097
and if she says. "No."
then you have your answer.

251
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.267
Yeah. true.

252
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.236
Aw. Zackary.

253
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.106
do you need me
to ask her out for you?

254
00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:25.308
No. I do not.

255
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:27.344
It's just. you know.
if I ask her out

256
00:16:27.376 --> 00:16:28.821
and she says. "No."
then she's not gonna

257
00:16:28.845 --> 00:16:31.048
wanna hang with us anymore.

258
00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:33.517
I kinda like her
hanging with us.

259
00:16:33.549 --> 00:16:36.553
Good point.

260
00:16:36.586 --> 00:16:38.789
What. what. it's a good point.

261
00:16:38.822 --> 00:16:40.690
I mean. she's nice.

262
00:16:40.722 --> 00:16:43.159
It's nice to make
new friends who are nice.

263
00:16:43.193 --> 00:16:45.761
Why do you need new friends?

264
00:16:45.794 --> 00:16:48.698
Aw. Jule. you need to
go to jelly school.

265
00:16:48.731 --> 00:16:50.266
Ew!

266
00:16:50.299 --> 00:16:52.835
Never touch me like that again.

267
00:16:52.869 --> 00:16:54.371
I'll never touch you
like that again.

268
00:16:56.606 --> 00:16:59.308
So. Al. can you
talk me up to her?

269
00:16:59.342 --> 00:17:02.678
Please. can you talk about
literally anything else?

270
00:17:02.712 --> 00:17:04.190
I don't know.
what makes you think that

271
00:17:04.214 --> 00:17:06.650
she would listen to me.
or that we even talk?

272
00:17:06.682 --> 00:17:09.486
I figured you guys became pals.

273
00:17:09.518 --> 00:17:11.487
Well. I mean. she's...

274
00:17:11.521 --> 00:17:13.390
Nice.

275
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.673
- What time's happy hour?
- Oh. shit.

276
00:17:29.706 --> 00:17:31.775
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

277
00:17:31.807 --> 00:17:34.343
No. it's okay... oh!

278
00:17:34.377 --> 00:17:36.847
- Oh. my God. okay.
- Okay.

279
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.349
Ah. right.

280
00:17:42.485 --> 00:17:43.887
Uh.

281
00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:46.323
Okay.

282
00:17:48.725 --> 00:17:51.495
- Are you okay?
- Uh. yes.

283
00:17:51.527 --> 00:17:54.230
- Yes. hi.
- Hi.

284
00:17:54.264 --> 00:17:57.133
- How are you?
- I'm good. I'm good.

285
00:17:57.167 --> 00:18:00.704
I. um. came by to see
if you're coming out...

286
00:18:00.736 --> 00:18:03.806
uh. to the club.
after your shift.

287
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.445
I mean. do you want to come out
to the club to dance?

288
00:18:08.477 --> 00:18:10.479
Right. right. um.

289
00:18:10.513 --> 00:18:12.448
I'm off work pretty late. so.

290
00:18:12.482 --> 00:18:14.118
Okay.

291
00:18:15.752 --> 00:18:17.654
Well. I mean.

292
00:18:17.687 --> 00:18:20.256
that was more of
a for-your-information

293
00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.292
than... than a no.

294
00:18:22.324 --> 00:18:25.294
Okay. so it's a yes then.

295
00:18:25.328 --> 00:18:27.264
Uh. it's a maybe.

296
00:18:27.296 --> 00:18:29.232
Probably.

297
00:18:33.535 --> 00:18:36.773
I mean. I was
in the neighborhood.

298
00:18:36.805 --> 00:18:39.308
That's why I'm here.
'cause Julia told me

299
00:18:39.342 --> 00:18:41.210
that you worked here.
and I was passing by.

300
00:18:41.244 --> 00:18:43.547
- and so I...
- Right. um.

301
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.814
well it's really nice
to see you. though.

302
00:18:45.848 --> 00:18:47.584
Thank you.

303
00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:54.591
Okay. so I guess I'll maybe.
probably see you later?

304
00:18:54.623 --> 00:18:56.692
- Yeah.
- Maybe. probably.

305
00:18:58.727 --> 00:19:01.965
Yes. um.

306
00:19:01.997 --> 00:19:04.433
Thanks for

307
00:19:04.467 --> 00:19:06.369
stopping by.

308
00:19:06.401 --> 00:19:08.237
You got it.

309
00:19:09.738 --> 00:19:12.342
Hey. before I forget.
do you have a pen?

310
00:19:12.374 --> 00:19:14.777
Uh. yeah. I think I do. sure.

311
00:19:27.857 --> 00:19:30.260
In case you need me
for anything.

312
00:19:31.928 --> 00:19:33.764
I'll see you later.

313
00:19:35.698 --> 00:19:37.534
Uh. see you later.

314
00:20:03.426 --> 00:20:04.961
Okay.

315
00:20:04.994 --> 00:20:06.996
You look good.

316
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.870
You look fine.
you're totally overthinking this

317
00:20:08.898 --> 00:20:11.834
'cause nothing's happening.

318
00:20:11.868 --> 00:20:13.770
Oh. God. what if
something is happening?

319
00:20:20.342 --> 00:20:21.878
Hey. what are we looking at?

320
00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.912
A very happy Zack.

321
00:20:23.946 --> 00:20:26.582
Oh. yeah. is he making friends?

322
00:20:26.615 --> 00:20:29.551
Well.

323
00:20:38.593 --> 00:20:40.529
I have to go.

324
00:20:40.563 --> 00:20:42.564
- Uh.
- Yeah. sorry.

325
00:20:44.766 --> 00:20:46.503
Okay.

326
00:20:53.676 --> 00:20:55.445
Alex.

327
00:20:55.477 --> 00:20:57.046
Alex. wait.

328
00:20:59.815 --> 00:21:01.750
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:01.784 --> 00:21:03.652
For what?

330
00:21:03.686 --> 00:21:06.356
I don't usually drink.
and I was dancing.

331
00:21:06.389 --> 00:21:08.824
- and I...
- You don't owe me anything.

332
00:21:11.593 --> 00:21:13.996
I just don't want you to think
I was doing it to hurt you

333
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.699
or something.

334
00:21:17.432 --> 00:21:19.736
I don't know what you mean.

335
00:21:21.536 --> 00:21:24.673
- I'm just nervous.
- Nervous?

336
00:21:24.707 --> 00:21:26.810
About what?

337
00:21:26.842 --> 00:21:28.879
You make me nervous.

338
00:21:41.757 --> 00:21:43.625
Erin. where are you going?

339
00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:46.428
I'm all sweaty.
I'm going for a swim.

340
00:21:46.461 --> 00:21:47.963
I thought I was
walking you home.

341
00:21:47.996 --> 00:21:50.632
not brushing up on my CPR.

342
00:21:50.666 --> 00:21:52.402
So. come in with me then.

343
00:21:54.637 --> 00:21:56.406
That doesn't make any sense.

344
00:22:05.715 --> 00:22:07.984
Are you coming?

345
00:22:17.126 --> 00:22:19.796
Hey. there you are.
I was looking for you.

346
00:22:19.829 --> 00:22:21.798
Thought you left.

347
00:22:21.831 --> 00:22:24.767
No. I'm right here.

348
00:22:24.801 --> 00:22:26.002
Did you wanna get dressed?

349
00:22:26.034 --> 00:22:27.836
I mean. I can wait.

350
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.439
Are you sleeping
with me tonight?

351
00:22:32.842 --> 00:22:34.977
Uh.

352
00:22:35.011 --> 00:22:36.687
I just meant 'cause my bed's
more comfortable

353
00:22:36.711 --> 00:22:40.416
than the couch. so.

354
00:22:40.449 --> 00:22:42.151
Oh. right.

355
00:22:42.185 --> 00:22:44.921
No. cool. um.

356
00:22:44.954 --> 00:22:47.957
No. I was just gonna
head home soon.

357
00:22:47.989 --> 00:22:49.625
Okay.

358
00:22:49.659 --> 00:22:50.893
Sure.

359
00:22:52.829 --> 00:22:54.097
Wait. I'm sorry.

360
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.966
Oh. my God. I am so sorry.

361
00:22:56.998 --> 00:22:59.701
Oh. my God.

362
00:22:59.735 --> 00:23:02.472
It's okay.

363
00:23:02.505 --> 00:23:04.474
Hey. it's okay.

364
00:23:13.716 --> 00:23:15.717
Um. listen.

365
00:23:15.751 --> 00:23:18.221
I... I...

366
00:23:18.254 --> 00:23:19.697
I don't know what's happening.
and I don't wanna

367
00:23:19.721 --> 00:23:21.824
misread anything.

368
00:23:21.858 --> 00:23:24.494
I don't think that
you're misreading anything.

369
00:23:27.897 --> 00:23:30.066
Will you look at me. please?

370
00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.192
Do you want me?

371
00:24:05.967 --> 00:24:08.537
Yes.

372
00:26:56.805 --> 00:26:58.240
Erin?

373
00:27:01.043 --> 00:27:02.911
Shit.

374
00:27:15.357 --> 00:27:17.694
Alex. what are you doing here?

375
00:27:17.726 --> 00:27:19.996
Oh. well you weren't there
when I woke up. so.

376
00:27:20.028 --> 00:27:23.965
I was. uh...
I needed to get to work.

377
00:27:23.998 --> 00:27:25.400
Right. I...

378
00:27:25.434 --> 00:27:28.171
Uh. could we...?

379
00:27:28.204 --> 00:27:29.906
Sure.

380
00:27:36.946 --> 00:27:38.180
What's up... ah.

381
00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:42.150
Okay. um.

382
00:27:42.184 --> 00:27:44.120
can we talk about
what happened last night?

383
00:27:44.152 --> 00:27:46.389
- No.
- What. are you serious?

384
00:27:46.421 --> 00:27:48.056
Yeah. something happened.

385
00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.260
I don't know what. and I...

386
00:27:51.293 --> 00:27:52.928
You... you don't... you don't know...

387
00:27:52.961 --> 00:27:54.472
- Erin. we slept together.
- Okay. can you please

388
00:27:54.496 --> 00:27:56.032
keep your voice down.
because we are at

389
00:27:56.064 --> 00:27:57.332
my work right now?

390
00:27:57.365 --> 00:27:58.876
- So. uh...
- It's not fricking illegal.

391
00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.236
- I mean...
- Okay. I need you to

392
00:28:00.268 --> 00:28:01.770
forget about this.

393
00:28:03.872 --> 00:28:06.241
What? No. no.

394
00:28:06.275 --> 00:28:08.977
No. Erin. it was amazing.
and you were right there with me

395
00:28:09.011 --> 00:28:11.114
and I know that
you felt the same way.

396
00:28:11.147 --> 00:28:12.814
- Stop.
- You came on to me.

397
00:28:12.848 --> 00:28:14.291
- I wasn't gonna do anything.
- Please. I need you to

398
00:28:14.315 --> 00:28:17.853
fucking stop. I need you to
fucking stop. Alex!

399
00:28:17.887 --> 00:28:19.856
Can you please fucking stop?

400
00:28:23.292 --> 00:28:24.794
Can you please go?

401
00:28:26.795 --> 00:28:28.397
I need you to go. please.

402
00:29:10.272 --> 00:29:12.942
- Hey. Jule.
- Hey. you.

403
00:29:12.975 --> 00:29:16.111
- What's up?
- How are you?

404
00:29:16.144 --> 00:29:18.313
Yeah. I'm fine.

405
00:29:18.346 --> 00:29:21.449
Great. but how are you actually?

406
00:29:21.483 --> 00:29:23.519
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.

407
00:29:23.552 --> 00:29:25.021
you completely bailed
last night.

408
00:29:25.053 --> 00:29:28.190
- Where'd you go?
- Yeah. sorry.

409
00:29:28.224 --> 00:29:29.466
Well. don't be sorry.
just tell me

410
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:30.926
what's going on with you.

411
00:29:33.495 --> 00:29:36.299
Hello?

412
00:29:36.332 --> 00:29:40.268
Can you just trust that
I'll tell you when I'm ready?

413
00:29:40.302 --> 00:29:43.171
Okay.

414
00:29:43.205 --> 00:29:44.439
Should I be worried?

415
00:29:47.508 --> 00:29:49.978
No.

416
00:29:50.012 --> 00:29:51.313
Okay.

417
00:29:51.346 --> 00:29:53.014
Come for a drink tonight?

418
00:29:55.316 --> 00:29:58.153
Uh. yeah. sure.

419
00:29:58.187 --> 00:29:59.396
I mean.
I'll meet you down there.

420
00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.591
Cool. see you soon. pal.

421
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.462
Fuck.

422
00:30:25.915 --> 00:30:27.082
Where have you have been?

423
00:30:27.115 --> 00:30:30.118
You almost missed happy hour.

424
00:30:30.151 --> 00:30:31.286
I'm sorry.

425
00:30:33.354 --> 00:30:36.525
Anyway. so as I was saying.
I was on a date with this dude.

426
00:30:36.557 --> 00:30:38.660
and he asks me
what I like to do for fun.

427
00:30:38.694 --> 00:30:40.496
I hate that question.

428
00:30:40.528 --> 00:30:44.232
So. I start telling him about
this book that I'm reading.

429
00:30:44.265 --> 00:30:47.202
Alex. have I told you
about this. book guy?

430
00:30:47.236 --> 00:30:49.639
Uh. yeah. sure. I think...
I think so.

431
00:30:49.671 --> 00:30:51.339
Anyway.

432
00:30:51.372 --> 00:30:53.008
so I'm telling him
about this book.

433
00:30:53.042 --> 00:30:55.410
and he gets this look
on his face.

434
00:30:55.444 --> 00:30:58.614
like either he's never heard
the word "book" before.

435
00:30:58.647 --> 00:31:01.250
or the idea of a woman reading

436
00:31:01.283 --> 00:31:04.419
is way too much for
his tiny brain to comprehend.

437
00:31:04.453 --> 00:31:07.123
I really don't get it. I mean.
guys say that they want a girl

438
00:31:07.156 --> 00:31:09.358
that's smart and interesting.
but I mean.

439
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.993
really they actually don't.

440
00:31:12.024 --> 00:31:13.129
- Right?
- Yeah.

441
00:31:13.161 --> 00:31:16.131
Hey. how's the weather
where you are?

442
00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:19.068
- What?
- Where are you right now?

443
00:31:19.101 --> 00:31:21.370
Uh. I think
I'm gonna get a drink.

444
00:31:21.402 --> 00:31:22.614
Actually. you know. I should go.

445
00:31:22.638 --> 00:31:25.073
I have this thing
that I gotta do.

446
00:31:25.107 --> 00:31:26.575
Uhh. like what?

447
00:31:26.608 --> 00:31:28.411
It's Friday night
during the summer.

448
00:31:28.444 --> 00:31:30.980
What do you have to do?

449
00:31:31.013 --> 00:31:33.316
Early inventory.

450
00:31:33.349 --> 00:31:37.285
Like you've never
done inventory hungover.

451
00:31:37.319 --> 00:31:39.655
Erin. please explain to her

452
00:31:39.688 --> 00:31:43.124
why she needs to stop pretending
to be so responsible.

453
00:31:43.158 --> 00:31:45.428
You really gotta stop it.

454
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.366
Okay.

455
00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:52.668
Alex!

456
00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.271
Alex. what the hell?

457
00:31:56.304 --> 00:31:58.673
I just can't.

458
00:32:01.709 --> 00:32:03.278
Hey. Al.

459
00:32:05.447 --> 00:32:08.316
All right.

460
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.119
What's wrong with her?

461
00:32:10.151 --> 00:32:12.354
- I don't know.
- Are you sure?

462
00:32:12.388 --> 00:32:15.757
Yeah. Julia.
I don't even know her.

463
00:32:15.791 --> 00:32:18.727
- I don't believe you.
- Hey.

464
00:32:18.761 --> 00:32:21.063
What the fuck was that about?

465
00:32:21.095 --> 00:32:23.298
I have no idea.

466
00:32:23.332 --> 00:32:25.200
- I should go after her.
- No.

467
00:32:25.234 --> 00:32:27.436
Stop mothering her. okay?

468
00:32:27.468 --> 00:32:30.305
Storming off like that.
she needs some time alone.

469
00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:32.308
She went to the beach. just...

470
00:32:32.341 --> 00:32:34.577
she'll be fine.

471
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.611
You know. I think
I'm gonna head out.

472
00:32:36.644 --> 00:32:38.179
Honestly.
I wouldn't worry about her.

473
00:32:38.213 --> 00:32:40.282
She seems like
a really tough girl.

474
00:32:40.314 --> 00:32:42.418
I'm sure
she's gonna be fine. so.

475
00:32:44.419 --> 00:32:45.653
- Erin.
- Hm?

476
00:32:45.687 --> 00:32:48.024
Alex has been through
a lot of shit.

477
00:32:48.056 --> 00:32:51.026
If she is messed up
in something. please tell me.

478
00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.596
Yeah. honestly. I'm sorry.
but I don't know.

479
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:57.466
Jule. why would
she know anything?

480
00:32:57.498 --> 00:32:59.101
Well. have a good night. guys.

481
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.683
Alex.

482
00:33:19.321 --> 00:33:23.458
No. you don't get to come here
and look at me like that.

483
00:33:23.492 --> 00:33:26.361
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'm sorry.

484
00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:32.333
I don't understand.

485
00:33:32.367 --> 00:33:35.104
We didn't do anything wrong.

486
00:33:35.137 --> 00:33:37.505
You're acting like we've
done this terrible thing.

487
00:33:37.538 --> 00:33:39.842
Are you in a relationship
or something?

488
00:33:39.874 --> 00:33:42.243
You don't get it. do you?

489
00:33:42.276 --> 00:33:43.578
No. I don't get it.

490
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:46.415
I need you to explain it to me.

491
00:33:46.448 --> 00:33:48.184
I fucking can't.

492
00:33:58.226 --> 00:33:59.562
Did you like it?

493
00:34:03.564 --> 00:34:05.333
You had fun with me?

494
00:34:05.367 --> 00:34:06.669
Yes.

495
00:34:08.269 --> 00:34:09.771
And you like me?

496
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.443
Do we really have to
talk about it all night?

497
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:22.684
What are you so scared
of talking about?

498
00:34:22.718 --> 00:34:24.220
Are you scared
of the way you feel?

499
00:34:26.188 --> 00:34:28.756
Do we really have to do this?

500
00:34:30.791 --> 00:34:33.428
- Are you scared of being gay?
- Okay. shut the fuck up.

501
00:34:33.461 --> 00:34:35.697
I'm not fucking scared.

502
00:34:35.731 --> 00:34:37.600
You're just wrong.

503
00:34:37.633 --> 00:34:39.568
I need to go.

504
00:34:39.601 --> 00:34:40.903
- Wrong?
- Yeah. you're just

505
00:34:40.936 --> 00:34:42.470
fucking wrong. Alex!

506
00:34:42.503 --> 00:34:44.372
I'm leaving.

507
00:34:44.405 --> 00:34:45.807
Erin!

508
00:35:14.202 --> 00:35:16.438
Hey.

509
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.206
It's Erin.

510
00:35:20.242 --> 00:35:22.144
What are you doing?

511
00:35:34.256 --> 00:35:35.758
What are you doing here?

512
00:35:35.791 --> 00:35:39.628
That's seriously what you wanna
say to me right now?

513
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.697
Alex. what the fuck is going on?

514
00:35:44.633 --> 00:35:46.468
Just having a drink.

515
00:35:46.501 --> 00:35:49.905
You won't answer my calls
and you won't talk to me.

516
00:35:49.938 --> 00:35:51.974
What's happening here. Al?

517
00:35:52.006 --> 00:35:54.209
You're the one with straight As.

518
00:35:54.242 --> 00:35:55.910
I'm sure you can figure it out.

519
00:35:55.943 --> 00:35:58.680
Why are you being a smart ass?

520
00:35:58.713 --> 00:36:01.282
Look. I just came here
to have a drink. okay. alone.

521
00:36:01.316 --> 00:36:04.687
You don't get to come here
and start yelling at me.

522
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.889
Besides.

523
00:36:06.921 --> 00:36:08.923
no one else
wants to fucking talk.

524
00:36:08.956 --> 00:36:11.626
- so why the fuck should I?
- Because there's obviously

525
00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.596
something going on.

526
00:36:13.628 --> 00:36:15.363
- So?
- So. I'm your best friend

527
00:36:15.396 --> 00:36:18.266
and I wanna help you.

528
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.635
Yeah. I bet you do.

529
00:36:20.668 --> 00:36:22.637
- Alex.
- I bet you wanna dance in here.

530
00:36:22.671 --> 00:36:24.281
looking all pretty.
and fuck everything up.

531
00:36:24.305 --> 00:36:26.909
and then pretend like
nothing ever happened.

532
00:36:26.941 --> 00:36:28.843
- What the fuck...?
- Well. it did happen!

533
00:36:28.876 --> 00:36:30.478
- It happened!
- What happened?

534
00:36:30.512 --> 00:36:32.615
Leave me alone. don't touch me!

535
00:36:34.048 --> 00:36:37.253
You know what. Alex?

536
00:36:37.285 --> 00:36:39.621
Fuck you.

537
00:36:39.655 --> 00:36:41.857
You know I just wanna help.

538
00:36:48.063 --> 00:36:51.432
Sorry. I can't offer you
anything fun to drink.

539
00:36:51.465 --> 00:36:53.268
That's okay.

540
00:36:53.302 --> 00:36:54.903
Are you all right?

541
00:36:54.936 --> 00:36:57.805
You sounded kind of upset
on the phone.

542
00:36:57.838 --> 00:37:01.543
I didn't invite you
over here to talk.

543
00:37:01.575 --> 00:37:05.813
I am so done talking.

544
00:37:05.847 --> 00:37:07.582
Okay.

545
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.559
Sorry. I thought
that was my cue.

546
00:37:18.593 --> 00:37:19.861
Are you saying. "No"?

547
00:37:19.894 --> 00:37:22.497
No.

548
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.400
Uh.

549
00:37:25.434 --> 00:37:26.901
Just... just wait a minute.

550
00:37:26.934 --> 00:37:28.770
Just a sec.

551
00:37:37.713 --> 00:37:40.916
Okay. so you're saying. "Yes"?

552
00:37:40.948 --> 00:37:44.452
I'm saying. "Just fuck me."

553
00:38:22.858 --> 00:38:25.093
Jesus. I'm coming.

554
00:38:33.702 --> 00:38:35.638
I'm sorry.

555
00:38:37.171 --> 00:38:39.574
I'm sorry.

556
00:38:39.608 --> 00:38:41.510
I'm an asshole.

557
00:38:41.543 --> 00:38:42.845
None of that was meant for you.

558
00:38:42.878 --> 00:38:45.013
Don't ever speak to me
like that again.

559
00:38:45.046 --> 00:38:46.515
Just the whiskey.

560
00:38:46.548 --> 00:38:47.950
I'm serious.

561
00:38:50.017 --> 00:38:52.086
I know. I know.

562
00:38:52.119 --> 00:38:54.756
I'm sorry.

563
00:38:54.789 --> 00:38:56.958
I didn't mean any of it.

564
00:39:16.177 --> 00:39:18.646
What am I going to do with you?

565
00:39:20.581 --> 00:39:22.884
Fix my broken heart.

566
00:39:22.918 --> 00:39:24.986
- What?
- What?

567
00:39:25.019 --> 00:39:27.456
- Why do you have a broken heart?
- Why do you have...?

568
00:39:27.488 --> 00:39:29.490
Alex.

569
00:39:33.961 --> 00:39:35.430
Okay.

570
00:39:38.767 --> 00:39:41.503
Okay. so I am very drunk.

571
00:39:41.535 --> 00:39:43.704
so I think I'm gonna
tell you something right now

572
00:39:43.738 --> 00:39:45.474
that sober Alex
definitely wouldn't tell you

573
00:39:45.506 --> 00:39:47.809
because sober Alex
is scared shitless.

574
00:39:47.843 --> 00:39:49.812
Well. drunk Alex
and sober Alex need to start

575
00:39:49.845 --> 00:39:52.448
trusting their best friend.

576
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:55.883
They do... I mean. I... I do.

577
00:39:55.916 --> 00:39:59.020
It's nothing to do with
not trusting you.

578
00:39:59.053 --> 00:40:00.889
Then. what is it about?

579
00:40:03.992 --> 00:40:06.061
- I think I need a cigarette.
- Uh. no.

580
00:40:08.497 --> 00:40:10.132
Speak.

581
00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.171
You love me. right?

582
00:40:17.204 --> 00:40:19.073
Like...

583
00:40:19.106 --> 00:40:21.610
Like no matter what?

584
00:40:21.642 --> 00:40:24.545
Of course I love you. you idiot.

585
00:40:24.579 --> 00:40:26.582
Nothing you can say
will change that.

586
00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:34.722
Dude. I will help you
bury the body.

587
00:40:34.756 --> 00:40:37.659
I will destroy the evidence.

588
00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:40.661
It honestly can't be that bad.

589
00:40:40.695 --> 00:40:43.731
Whatever it is. man.

590
00:40:43.764 --> 00:40:45.066
it's me.

591
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.976
I'm gay.

592
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.722
Well. I mean. you weren't
hiding that very well.

593
00:41:16.731 --> 00:41:18.800
I'm in love. too.

594
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.673
I'm sorry you were so scared
to tell me that.

595
00:41:26.575 --> 00:41:29.077
I'm so sorry it took me
so long to tell you.

596
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.178
No.

597
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:32.947
You told me when you were ready.

598
00:41:35.749 --> 00:41:38.019
So. Romeo.

599
00:41:38.052 --> 00:41:40.088
who's the lucky lady?

600
00:41:43.592 --> 00:41:45.059
Are you okay?

601
00:41:51.166 --> 00:41:53.901
- Erin.
- I'm fine.

602
00:41:53.934 --> 00:41:57.338
- If you wanna talk about...
- I don't.

603
00:41:57.372 --> 00:41:59.575
Okay.
just consider this a freebie.

604
00:41:59.608 --> 00:42:01.610
You're off the hook.

605
00:42:01.642 --> 00:42:04.211
What?

606
00:42:04.244 --> 00:42:07.281
Look. I know I may seem
like I'm that kind of guy.

607
00:42:07.314 --> 00:42:09.818
but I'm not that kind of guy.

608
00:42:11.653 --> 00:42:13.221
- Erin.
- Look. Zack.

609
00:42:13.253 --> 00:42:16.023
it doesn't really matter
what kind of guy you are. okay?

610
00:42:16.057 --> 00:42:18.961
Fuck. why is it that when a guy
wants to have casual sex.

611
00:42:18.994 --> 00:42:21.196
it's totally fine.
and when a girl wants to.

612
00:42:21.229 --> 00:42:22.731
there must be a fucking problem.

613
00:42:22.764 --> 00:42:24.765
I never said
there was a problem.

614
00:42:24.798 --> 00:42:26.735
You just seemed upset.

615
00:42:26.767 --> 00:42:28.202
Sorry.

616
00:42:28.235 --> 00:42:30.338
Look. I know
we may have done things

617
00:42:30.372 --> 00:42:34.309
a little backwards here.
but I like you.

618
00:42:34.342 --> 00:42:36.077
- I'd like to...
- No.

619
00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.313
- What?
- Whatever you'd like to do

620
00:42:38.345 --> 00:42:40.681
is a fucking terrible idea.

621
00:42:40.715 --> 00:42:42.249
Taking you on a date's
a terrible idea?

622
00:42:42.282 --> 00:42:44.752
- Oh. yeah.
- Why?

623
00:42:44.785 --> 00:42:47.021
Just. fuck. I'm giving you
an easy out here.

624
00:42:47.055 --> 00:42:48.624
I'm not looking for an easy out.

625
00:42:48.657 --> 00:42:52.093
This was just a distraction.

626
00:42:52.126 --> 00:42:53.728
Okay?

627
00:42:53.762 --> 00:42:56.164
This isn't gonna
turn into a whirlwind romance.

628
00:42:56.197 --> 00:42:58.700
It's just sex.

629
00:42:58.733 --> 00:43:01.202
Jesus.

630
00:43:01.235 --> 00:43:03.671
Well.

631
00:43:03.704 --> 00:43:05.306
that's why I don't do this.

632
00:43:07.675 --> 00:43:09.010
Goodnight. Erin.

633
00:43:49.483 --> 00:43:51.786
This is Alex. leave me one.

634
00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.354
Alex.

635
00:43:55.923 --> 00:43:57.692
I'm so sorry.

636
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:23.351
- What happened?
- Ugh. whoa.

637
00:44:33.128 --> 00:44:34.930
Are you gay.
or was that a dream?

638
00:44:37.131 --> 00:44:39.233
Gay.

639
00:44:39.267 --> 00:44:40.836
Not a dream.

640
00:44:40.869 --> 00:44:42.204
Okay.

641
00:44:43.972 --> 00:44:46.807
Cool.

642
00:44:48.876 --> 00:44:50.911
Ugh.

643
00:44:50.945 --> 00:44:52.180
I need a shower.

644
00:44:52.213 --> 00:44:54.850
Mhm.

645
00:44:54.883 --> 00:44:58.086
You stink like a dirty bar.

646
00:44:58.119 --> 00:45:00.088
Yeah.

647
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:03.224
Probably 'cause
I was at a dirty bar.

648
00:45:03.258 --> 00:45:05.127
Mhm.

649
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.932
Are you okay?

650
00:45:13.034 --> 00:45:15.104
Yeah. I will be.

651
00:45:19.039 --> 00:45:21.744
I love you very. very much.

652
00:45:24.211 --> 00:45:28.249
I have to pee very. very much.

653
00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:39.360
I am so hungover.

654
00:45:41.095 --> 00:45:42.865
It's your own fault.

655
00:46:03.383 --> 00:46:06.021
Erin!

656
00:46:15.329 --> 00:46:18.232
Alex. what are you doing here?

657
00:46:18.265 --> 00:46:19.834
Nice.

658
00:46:19.867 --> 00:46:21.570
- Wait.
- No. you made it quite clear

659
00:46:21.602 --> 00:46:24.238
that you don't want me
to do that.

660
00:46:24.271 --> 00:46:26.440
Why did you call me last night?

661
00:46:27.541 --> 00:46:29.143
Were you...

662
00:46:31.012 --> 00:46:33.849
Were you apologizing
for fucking someone?

663
00:46:34.916 --> 00:46:35.984
I don't know.

664
00:46:36.017 --> 00:46:38.520
I don't know why I called you.

665
00:46:38.552 --> 00:46:40.188
I'm sorry.

666
00:46:49.564 --> 00:46:51.867
What are you doing?

667
00:46:53.233 --> 00:46:55.369
I don't know.

668
00:46:55.403 --> 00:46:57.639
Look. I don't know
what I'm doing.

669
00:46:57.671 --> 00:46:59.573
Okay?

670
00:46:59.606 --> 00:47:01.642
I don't know what this means.

671
00:47:03.144 --> 00:47:04.946
Okay.

672
00:47:06.981 --> 00:47:09.517
I know what it means. okay?

673
00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:11.986
Great. so I'm just
supposed to pretend

674
00:47:12.019 --> 00:47:14.355
like this is normal.

675
00:47:14.389 --> 00:47:16.992
I don't know. Erin.

676
00:47:17.025 --> 00:47:19.327
But I mean.

677
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.504
you should have
some fucking idea

678
00:47:20.528 --> 00:47:22.296
of what you're doing.

679
00:47:22.329 --> 00:47:24.298
Do you give a shit
about me at all?

680
00:47:24.331 --> 00:47:27.134
Yes. Yes.

681
00:47:29.369 --> 00:47:31.005
Okay.

682
00:47:33.508 --> 00:47:37.012
Then how could you have sex
with someone else?

683
00:47:38.079 --> 00:47:40.682
Look. I was just trying to...

684
00:47:42.249 --> 00:47:45.387
I needed to figure out
whether I...

685
00:47:45.419 --> 00:47:47.655
Yeah. okay.

686
00:47:49.356 --> 00:47:52.393
I know what you needed.

687
00:47:54.695 --> 00:47:56.597
Hope you feel better.

688
00:47:56.631 --> 00:47:59.067
It's not like it was
just someone random. Alex.

689
00:48:07.742 --> 00:48:10.678
My God. Making the rounds. huh?

690
00:48:10.711 --> 00:48:13.314
No. wait. Alex...

691
00:48:13.347 --> 00:48:14.615
You know what?

692
00:48:14.648 --> 00:48:19.053
Don't touch me ever again.

693
00:48:19.086 --> 00:48:22.523
And for the record. you can't
fuck yourself straight.

694
00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:33.300
She fucked Zack!

695
00:48:36.104 --> 00:48:37.904
Why the fuck do you care
that I was with Erin?

696
00:48:41.209 --> 00:48:42.677
Alex!

697
00:48:44.345 --> 00:48:45.613
Alex. what the fuck?

698
00:48:48.615 --> 00:48:51.619
You fucked her and she let you
because she's scared!

699
00:48:54.488 --> 00:48:57.057
What the fuck
are you talking about?

700
00:49:00.327 --> 00:49:02.429
I'm in love with her. Zack!

701
00:49:02.463 --> 00:49:04.566
Alex. I didn't... I didn't know.

702
00:49:04.599 --> 00:49:07.202
Yeah. well now you do.

703
00:49:25.619 --> 00:49:27.655
Can I help you?

704
00:49:29.456 --> 00:49:31.425
What are you doing?

705
00:49:31.459 --> 00:49:33.628
What does it look like
I'm doing?

706
00:49:38.398 --> 00:49:41.168
Erin...

707
00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:54.515
Kiss me.

708
00:50:14.769 --> 00:50:17.205
No. No. no. No.

709
00:50:17.238 --> 00:50:19.240
No.

710
00:50:19.273 --> 00:50:20.584
No. I can't wake up
in the morning again

711
00:50:20.608 --> 00:50:22.142
and have you not be there.

712
00:50:22.175 --> 00:50:24.311
I can't be this mistake
that you keep making.

713
00:50:24.345 --> 00:50:28.183
Look. I don't know how to be
with you for real. Alex. so...

714
00:50:28.215 --> 00:50:31.218
You just be with me. Erin.

715
00:50:31.251 --> 00:50:32.586
There's nothing in the way.

716
00:50:32.619 --> 00:50:33.720
I'm all yours.

717
00:50:33.753 --> 00:50:35.522
Yeah.

718
00:50:35.555 --> 00:50:38.559
What am I supposed
to do with that. hm?

719
00:50:38.593 --> 00:50:40.628
I don't know
what to do with that.

720
00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:43.197
And what does that
even mean. Alex?

721
00:50:43.231 --> 00:50:45.867
You don't know
what my life is like.

722
00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.802
Okay. so tell me.

723
00:50:49.202 --> 00:50:50.204
Yeah. I fucking can't.

724
00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.209
Yeah. so... so that's just it?

725
00:50:57.378 --> 00:50:59.814
God.

726
00:50:59.847 --> 00:51:01.682
You're so fucking void
of emotion

727
00:51:01.715 --> 00:51:03.117
that you can't even see love

728
00:51:03.151 --> 00:51:04.553
when it's staring you
in the face.

729
00:51:06.253 --> 00:51:09.223
God. your dad really did
fuck you up. huh?

730
00:51:09.256 --> 00:51:11.459
Oh!

731
00:51:11.492 --> 00:51:13.628
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

732
00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:17.331
No. I mean. at least
you're feeling something.

733
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.470
Look. I...

734
00:51:23.503 --> 00:51:25.639
Before I met you. I...

735
00:51:27.707 --> 00:51:32.213
I would never have thought
that this would be me. okay?

736
00:51:32.246 --> 00:51:34.715
And I don't know how to...

737
00:51:34.749 --> 00:51:36.451
I don't know
how to process this.

738
00:51:36.483 --> 00:51:40.654
I don't even know
how to begin to process this.

739
00:51:40.688 --> 00:51:44.659
Okay. well.
let's process it together.

740
00:51:44.691 --> 00:51:47.294
I mean. you're not alone
in this.

741
00:51:47.327 --> 00:51:50.797
Julia knows. Zack knows. God.

742
00:51:50.831 --> 00:51:54.302
I mean. who gives a fuck
what anybody else thinks?

743
00:51:55.936 --> 00:51:57.471
You told them?

744
00:51:57.505 --> 00:52:00.608
Yeah. I needed to talk about it.

745
00:52:03.343 --> 00:52:05.380
Okay. Erin.
I know that you're scared.

746
00:52:05.412 --> 00:52:08.182
I know that this...

747
00:52:08.215 --> 00:52:09.550
that this derailed you a bit

748
00:52:09.584 --> 00:52:11.186
and it took you by surprise.

749
00:52:11.218 --> 00:52:14.289
but you can't pretend
like this doesn't exist.

750
00:52:14.322 --> 00:52:17.624
Hmm. I. uh. I wish
that you'd met somebody else

751
00:52:17.657 --> 00:52:19.293
that night on the dance floor

752
00:52:19.327 --> 00:52:21.662
and I wish that she could
give you what you need

753
00:52:21.695 --> 00:52:23.464
because I can't.

754
00:52:25.465 --> 00:52:28.936
That's how you feel?
You wish you'd never met me?

755
00:52:32.506 --> 00:52:34.676
Say something!

756
00:52:36.876 --> 00:52:38.445
Fine.

757
00:52:38.479 --> 00:52:41.216
Fine. uh. right.
you want me to forget.

758
00:52:41.249 --> 00:52:42.792
Sure. let's forget.
let's put it all behind us.

759
00:52:42.816 --> 00:52:45.753
one big fucked up mistake.

760
00:52:45.785 --> 00:52:48.423
I can't believe you told them.

761
00:52:49.624 --> 00:52:52.227
Yeah. well. I had to!

762
00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.729
I can't just bury this
like you can!

763
00:52:55.762 --> 00:52:57.731
God. it's like...

764
00:52:57.764 --> 00:53:00.667
It's like you... you're living
in this fantasy land

765
00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:02.412
where you think you can fuck
whoever you want

766
00:53:02.436 --> 00:53:03.946
and not have to worry
about the consequences.

767
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:07.474
It's like you don't think
any of this is real.

768
00:53:07.508 --> 00:53:08.543
Huh.

769
00:53:08.575 --> 00:53:10.911
Whether we talk about it or not.

770
00:53:10.945 --> 00:53:12.981
and whether people
know about it or not.

771
00:53:13.014 --> 00:53:15.282
the way that you're feeling
is fucking real. Erin.

772
00:53:15.316 --> 00:53:16.684
it's real!

773
00:53:25.358 --> 00:53:27.794
That's the part that scares me.

774
00:53:27.827 --> 00:53:29.496
Alex.

775
00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:31.466
It's my feelings.

776
00:53:31.499 --> 00:53:33.368
Okay. how am I supposed
to just one day decide

777
00:53:33.401 --> 00:53:34.969
that I like women?

778
00:53:35.001 --> 00:53:37.738
It wasn't a decision. Erin.

779
00:53:37.771 --> 00:53:41.008
It was a realization.

780
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:42.809
It's always been there.

781
00:53:42.843 --> 00:53:44.045
You've just been hiding

782
00:53:44.077 --> 00:53:45.813
this part of yourself
for so long.

783
00:53:45.845 --> 00:53:48.416
Erin. this is... this is
who you are.

784
00:53:48.448 --> 00:53:51.785
This is who you've always been
before you ever even met me.

785
00:53:51.818 --> 00:53:53.387
No.

786
00:53:55.356 --> 00:53:57.792
Look. I'm here. okay?

787
00:53:57.825 --> 00:53:59.060
I'm here.

788
00:53:59.093 --> 00:54:02.630
We can do all of this together.

789
00:54:02.662 --> 00:54:06.066
Just... just let me love you.

790
00:54:08.968 --> 00:54:11.673
Sorry. but this just isn't me.

791
00:54:13.374 --> 00:54:15.843
Please. Erin.

792
00:54:15.876 --> 00:54:17.678
No. this isn't me.

793
00:54:17.711 --> 00:54:21.481
- No. come here.
- Don't touch me.

794
00:54:21.514 --> 00:54:23.417
I'm sorry I came here today.

795
00:54:24.985 --> 00:54:26.887
Do you love me?

796
00:54:26.921 --> 00:54:30.058
Yeah. it doesn't fucking matter.
does it?

797
00:54:40.034 --> 00:54:42.537
I come in peace.

798
00:54:46.139 --> 00:54:48.075
How's your face?

799
00:54:48.108 --> 00:54:49.943
You punched it. It hurts.

800
00:54:56.983 --> 00:55:00.954
Oh. uh. this is my cue.

801
00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:06.360
Don't fucking wreck the place.

802
00:55:16.771 --> 00:55:18.973
I'm really sorry.

803
00:55:21.409 --> 00:55:24.646
I was just so mad.

804
00:55:26.012 --> 00:55:28.982
Yeah. I got that part.

805
00:55:30.785 --> 00:55:32.687
You didn't deserve that. though.

806
00:55:34.053 --> 00:55:35.021
You're right.

807
00:55:35.055 --> 00:55:36.524
I didn't.

808
00:55:40.961 --> 00:55:45.033
I'm also sorry because I know
that you were into her first.

809
00:55:47.168 --> 00:55:50.704
I don't think
our feelings compare.

810
00:55:50.738 --> 00:55:54.041
I had no idea.
You know that. right?

811
00:55:54.073 --> 00:55:56.077
Yeah. Of course.

812
00:55:56.110 --> 00:55:57.577
Of course I know that.

813
00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:00.647
It was just one of those things.

814
00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.117
It was late. We were drunk.

815
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:05.686
- She told me to...
- Okay.

816
00:56:05.718 --> 00:56:09.624
No. I don't need
any of those details.

817
00:56:09.657 --> 00:56:12.126
My imagination is on overdrive
as it is.

818
00:56:12.159 --> 00:56:13.994
Sorry.

819
00:56:14.028 --> 00:56:15.530
If it makes you feel any better.

820
00:56:15.563 --> 00:56:18.633
I don't think I rocked her world
or anything.

821
00:56:18.666 --> 00:56:21.535
It doesn't make me feel
any better.

822
00:56:21.568 --> 00:56:23.704
Are you okay?

823
00:56:25.939 --> 00:56:28.108
No.

824
00:56:28.142 --> 00:56:29.844
I'm not.

825
00:56:41.822 --> 00:56:43.992
We're closed.

826
00:56:49.262 --> 00:56:51.665
So...

827
00:56:51.698 --> 00:56:53.733
Riddle me this.

828
00:56:53.767 --> 00:56:57.705
I've now found
both of you separately

829
00:56:57.738 --> 00:57:00.140
in your respective places
at work

830
00:57:00.173 --> 00:57:04.111
getting drunk alone
over each other.

831
00:57:06.713 --> 00:57:08.248
I don't know what
you're talking about.

832
00:57:09.749 --> 00:57:11.084
Okay.

833
00:57:11.117 --> 00:57:12.619
If we're gonna get drunk
in a cafe.

834
00:57:12.653 --> 00:57:15.657
let's have some class. shall we?

835
00:57:37.177 --> 00:57:39.046
To Alex.

836
00:57:49.155 --> 00:57:51.692
So let's have a chat.

837
00:57:53.626 --> 00:57:55.929
I can wait all day.

838
00:58:00.166 --> 00:58:02.135
You don't fucking get it.

839
00:58:03.938 --> 00:58:09.075
Okay. do you have any idea
what my father would say?

840
00:58:09.108 --> 00:58:12.112
Or even worse.
what he would think?

841
00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:18.218
I couldn't be affectionate
with her in public.

842
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:22.222
People would be looking at us
and making comments.

843
00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:28.162
I don't know
how to make this work. Jules.

844
00:58:31.097 --> 00:58:32.174
And I don't know how to love her

845
00:58:32.198 --> 00:58:34.834
without hurting her.

846
00:58:36.836 --> 00:58:39.273
I didn't realize
that the entire world

847
00:58:39.305 --> 00:58:42.108
had such a big influence
on who you love.

848
00:58:46.146 --> 00:58:48.783
I'm sorry. Jules.

849
00:58:50.284 --> 00:58:51.718
I know what
I've put her through.

850
00:58:51.751 --> 00:58:53.887
but I just... I just can't
fucking do it.

851
00:58:53.921 --> 00:58:56.957
- I can't.
- Then let her go.

852
00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.129
How's Zack?

853
00:59:02.162 --> 00:59:04.198
Which part?

854
00:59:04.231 --> 00:59:07.635
His feelings. his ego.
or his nose?

855
00:59:07.668 --> 00:59:10.604
His nose?

856
00:59:10.637 --> 00:59:12.139
Oh. God. did Alex...

857
00:59:12.171 --> 00:59:14.976
Fuck. I'm such
a fucking asshole.

858
00:59:15.008 --> 00:59:17.378
Yeah. I mean.
you could've worked out

859
00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:20.847
your internalized homophobia
literally any other way.

860
00:59:20.881 --> 00:59:22.283
Jules...

861
00:59:22.316 --> 00:59:24.785
Listen...

862
00:59:24.818 --> 00:59:28.789
I know you're going through
a lot of shit right now.

863
00:59:28.822 --> 00:59:31.092
but try not to drag
the people you care about

864
00:59:31.124 --> 00:59:34.061
through the shit with you.

865
00:59:34.093 --> 00:59:35.729
I'm sorry.

866
00:59:36.963 --> 00:59:38.865
I know two other people
who deserve that

867
00:59:38.898 --> 00:59:40.098
much more than I do right now.

868
00:59:42.669 --> 00:59:45.238
I'll see you at school. okay?

869
01:00:11.064 --> 01:00:15.702
No. it was seriously inside
the lettuce bag.

870
01:00:15.735 --> 01:00:16.903
Sorry. I'm sorry. what?

871
01:00:19.039 --> 01:00:22.176
Yeah. no. I'm serious.

872
01:00:22.209 --> 01:00:24.211
You ever think they're gonna
close this place down?

873
01:00:24.244 --> 01:00:27.081
No. Julia. That's blasphemy.

874
01:00:27.113 --> 01:00:29.684
Well. seriously.
you can't work here forever.

875
01:00:29.717 --> 01:00:31.026
What are you gonna do
when you graduate?

876
01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:33.220
Oh. I need to graduate first.

877
01:00:35.021 --> 01:00:36.090
Pardon me?

878
01:00:36.122 --> 01:00:38.391
I have this killer stats class.

879
01:00:38.425 --> 01:00:40.260
I don't think
I'm gonna survive it.

880
01:00:40.293 --> 01:00:42.896
Ooh. I have a friend.

881
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.865
I'm so proud of you.

882
01:00:44.898 --> 01:00:46.133
Shut up.

883
01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:47.735
No. she's a science major.

884
01:00:47.767 --> 01:00:50.271
She TAs a lot and loves stats.

885
01:00:50.303 --> 01:00:51.972
I'll ask her to tutor you.

886
01:00:52.005 --> 01:00:53.740
That makes me sound
like a real winner.

887
01:00:53.773 --> 01:00:55.375
Alex. it's okay to ask for help

888
01:00:55.409 --> 01:00:58.746
when you don't understand
something.

889
01:01:00.814 --> 01:01:02.349
Help.

890
01:01:02.381 --> 01:01:05.052
Ugh.

891
01:01:05.084 --> 01:01:08.354
Let her do what she's gonna do.

892
01:01:08.387 --> 01:01:13.059
She's gonna walk into my bar
with some dude.

893
01:01:13.093 --> 01:01:15.129
It's not your problem.

894
01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:21.102
Well...

895
01:01:21.135 --> 01:01:22.278
I never thought I'd say this.

896
01:01:22.302 --> 01:01:26.439
but I think I should go study
before I get too drunk.

897
01:01:26.472 --> 01:01:28.875
Music to my ears.

898
01:01:28.909 --> 01:01:30.144
Funny.

899
01:01:30.177 --> 01:01:31.879
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

900
01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:39.186
Hi.

901
01:01:39.218 --> 01:01:40.354
What are you doing?

902
01:01:40.387 --> 01:01:41.921
Um. saying hi.

903
01:01:41.954 --> 01:01:44.057
In Alex's bar with a guy?

904
01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:45.291
He's my boyfriend.

905
01:01:45.325 --> 01:01:47.828
Super.

906
01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.130
Just trying to move on
with my life. Julia.

907
01:01:50.164 --> 01:01:51.765
Wouldn't it be interesting

908
01:01:51.798 --> 01:01:54.034
if instead of moving on
with your life.

909
01:01:54.066 --> 01:01:55.969
you actually just lived it?

910
01:01:56.003 --> 01:01:57.071
I just came to say hi.

911
01:01:57.104 --> 01:01:59.140
I'm not looking for a lecture.

912
01:01:59.173 --> 01:02:00.941
Have you talked to somebody?

913
01:02:00.974 --> 01:02:03.309
Like a counselor?

914
01:02:03.343 --> 01:02:05.813
Okay. I'm gonna go get back
to my date.

915
01:02:05.845 --> 01:02:07.247
Oh. he's your date now.

916
01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.182
I thought he was your boyfriend.

917
01:02:09.215 --> 01:02:11.317
Yeah. um. well. he's...

918
01:02:11.351 --> 01:02:13.253
A man.

919
01:02:13.287 --> 01:02:17.892
Which is the only part
that actually matters. right?

920
01:02:17.925 --> 01:02:20.361
Listen. just talk to somebody.

921
01:02:20.394 --> 01:02:22.196
This is not your life.

922
01:02:22.229 --> 01:02:23.831
It's not who you are.

923
01:02:29.936 --> 01:02:32.572
Hey. are you Alex?

924
01:02:32.606 --> 01:02:34.475
Uh. yeah.

925
01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:38.445
Billie.

926
01:02:40.981 --> 01:02:43.217
- Hi.
- Hi.

927
01:02:43.249 --> 01:02:45.485
Julia texted me and told me
to meet you in the library.

928
01:02:45.519 --> 01:02:47.188
She said that you needed
a tutor.

929
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.890
And you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

930
01:02:50.923 --> 01:02:53.893
Ah. no. yes. I do. I do.

931
01:02:53.927 --> 01:02:55.229
God. she acts fast.

932
01:02:55.262 --> 01:02:57.363
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

933
01:02:57.396 --> 01:02:58.398
Yes. please.

934
01:02:58.432 --> 01:03:00.334
Uh. save me from the numbers.

935
01:03:00.367 --> 01:03:02.570
Okay. so where are you at?

936
01:03:02.602 --> 01:03:07.173
Well. I'm somewhere between

937
01:03:07.206 --> 01:03:09.943
I have no idea what I'm doing
and I want to quit school.

938
01:03:09.977 --> 01:03:12.146
Okay. look.

939
01:03:12.178 --> 01:03:15.883
I find it easier
to write out the whole formula.

940
01:03:25.626 --> 01:03:28.229
Does that make sense?

941
01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:31.030
Uh. yeah.

942
01:03:31.064 --> 01:03:32.533
Yeah. I think... I think it does.

943
01:04:14.707 --> 01:04:16.577
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

944
01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:20.113
Wait. Why do you think
you've made a mistake?

945
01:04:22.115 --> 01:04:23.317
I... I...

946
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:27.287
Just come in and listen.
meet some people.

947
01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.655
I wouldn't know what to say.

948
01:04:28.689 --> 01:04:30.257
You don't have to say anything.

949
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:32.358
You can even sit in the back
if you want to.

950
01:04:32.392 --> 01:04:35.629
It's at your own pace.
and there's free coffee.

951
01:04:35.662 --> 01:04:37.398
I don't have to say anything?

952
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:38.499
Nothing.

953
01:04:38.532 --> 01:04:39.633
- Just listen?
- Mm-hm.

954
01:04:45.005 --> 01:04:46.974
Okay.

955
01:05:04.992 --> 01:05:06.427
Um...

956
01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.164
Did you...

957
01:05:10.197 --> 01:05:13.166
Did you want
to get a drink with me?

958
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.234
Right now?

959
01:05:14.267 --> 01:05:16.203
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

960
01:05:16.235 --> 01:05:18.671
Actually. I know
the perfect place.

961
01:05:24.043 --> 01:05:25.345
Hello?

962
01:05:28.514 --> 01:05:30.516
Billie?

963
01:05:54.307 --> 01:05:56.410
Hello?

964
01:05:56.443 --> 01:05:59.046
Sorry. I was getting us
refreshments.

965
01:05:59.079 --> 01:06:01.481
This place is crazy.

966
01:06:01.514 --> 01:06:03.082
I know. it's pretty great.
right?

967
01:06:03.115 --> 01:06:05.151
- Do you work here?
- No.

968
01:06:05.184 --> 01:06:09.389
I just live in the basement
waiting for my Christine.

969
01:06:09.423 --> 01:06:11.125
Not a theater person?

970
01:06:11.157 --> 01:06:13.459
Oh. no. not at all.

971
01:06:13.492 --> 01:06:14.695
Phantom of the Opera?

972
01:06:14.727 --> 01:06:16.563
Oh. I know that one.

973
01:06:28.508 --> 01:06:30.511
- So. did we just break in?
- Technically. yes.

974
01:06:30.543 --> 01:06:33.646
but I have a key.
so they can't prove anything.

975
01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.648
I'm friends with the manager.

976
01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.717
He owed me a beer.

977
01:06:36.749 --> 01:06:38.217
What about you?

978
01:06:38.251 --> 01:06:40.053
Tell me all about Alex.

979
01:06:40.086 --> 01:06:43.423
- What are your aspirations?
- Business school.

980
01:06:43.456 --> 01:06:45.825
- That's sexy.
- Thank you.

981
01:06:45.858 --> 01:06:48.461
Um. I want to start
my own business.

982
01:06:48.494 --> 01:06:50.830
- Ooh. that's ambitious.
- Yeah. I mean. I work

983
01:06:50.863 --> 01:06:52.365
at this little dive bar
across town

984
01:06:52.398 --> 01:06:54.300
and we have regulars

985
01:06:54.334 --> 01:06:56.370
and everybody knows
everybody else.

986
01:06:56.403 --> 01:07:00.407
and it's just this. you know.
chill. safe place

987
01:07:00.439 --> 01:07:03.443
for people to hang out
and. I don't know.

988
01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:05.087
I just want to create
something like that.

989
01:07:05.111 --> 01:07:07.247
Like a dyke bar.

990
01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.348
Are you okay?

991
01:07:11.284 --> 01:07:13.186
- Yeah.
- Have you never heard

992
01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.789
the word "dyke" before?

993
01:07:15.822 --> 01:07:17.524
I mean. not in that context.

994
01:07:17.557 --> 01:07:19.693
What? Where have you been?

995
01:07:19.726 --> 01:07:21.095
Uh. in the closet.

996
01:07:21.128 --> 01:07:23.729
Oh. Alex.

997
01:07:23.762 --> 01:07:26.432
Have you never been
to a gay bar?

998
01:07:26.465 --> 01:07:27.601
I have not.

999
01:07:27.633 --> 01:07:29.802
Okay. it is official.

1000
01:07:29.836 --> 01:07:34.140
I am now your tutor in stats
and in being gay.

1001
01:07:36.209 --> 01:07:39.213
And I have a confession to make.

1002
01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.382
- It's okay.
- You don't even know

1003
01:07:42.414 --> 01:07:45.384
what I was gonna say.

1004
01:07:45.418 --> 01:07:49.222
That Julia purposefully asked
her lesbian friend

1005
01:07:49.256 --> 01:07:52.126
who happens to be good at stats
to tutor me

1006
01:07:52.159 --> 01:07:53.827
in hopes of us hitting it off.

1007
01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:56.329
So. did we?

1008
01:07:56.363 --> 01:07:58.565
Well. I followed you
into a deserted theater.

1009
01:07:58.597 --> 01:08:02.570
so. uh. I would say yes.

1010
01:08:05.604 --> 01:08:07.675
Do you want to follow me
somewhere else?

1011
01:08:10.843 --> 01:08:12.445
How was that for you?

1012
01:08:12.479 --> 01:08:15.448
- Overwhelming.
- That's okay.

1013
01:08:15.481 --> 01:08:17.750
Do you think you might
want to come back?

1014
01:08:17.784 --> 01:08:20.320
Possibly.

1015
01:08:20.353 --> 01:08:22.623
Are you a one-word woman?

1016
01:08:22.656 --> 01:08:26.860
I don't know.
I just never really...

1017
01:08:26.893 --> 01:08:28.629
That's okay.

1018
01:08:28.661 --> 01:08:30.597
It's baby steps.

1019
01:08:30.629 --> 01:08:32.698
You can sit at the back
as long as you like.

1020
01:08:32.732 --> 01:08:33.909
I mean. you can even sit
on the floor

1021
01:08:33.933 --> 01:08:36.302
if you really want to.

1022
01:08:39.572 --> 01:08:42.242
How do you know when to...

1023
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:46.312
I think there just comes a point

1024
01:08:46.345 --> 01:08:50.351
where it's harder to not say it
than to say it.

1025
01:08:52.818 --> 01:08:56.356
I don't even know
how to say it to myself.

1026
01:08:56.388 --> 01:08:58.758
Well. then that's
a really good place to start

1027
01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:00.660
because the only person
who really matters

1028
01:09:00.693 --> 01:09:02.963
in all of this is you.

1029
01:09:04.464 --> 01:09:06.767
So you've never
been here before?

1030
01:09:06.799 --> 01:09:10.469
No. No. I didn't know
this place existed.

1031
01:09:10.503 --> 01:09:12.973
Or that there were
other lesbians in town.

1032
01:09:13.005 --> 01:09:16.410
Oh. honey. you just wait.

1033
01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.748
Hey.

1034
01:09:22.781 --> 01:09:24.817
You don't have to hide anymore.

1035
01:09:39.665 --> 01:09:41.968
Thank you for not pushing me.

1036
01:09:42.001 --> 01:09:43.637
We're all here
for whenever you're ready

1037
01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:45.272
to find your voice.

1038
01:09:45.304 --> 01:09:46.606
I know it's in there.

1039
01:09:46.639 --> 01:09:48.374
Trust it.

1040
01:09:48.407 --> 01:09:50.977
- I'm really scared.
- And that's okay.

1041
01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:54.281
That probably won't go away
anytime soon.

1042
01:09:54.313 --> 01:09:56.582
But I promise that when you do
find those words.

1043
01:09:56.616 --> 01:09:58.318
everything will change.

1044
01:10:06.593 --> 01:10:07.770
You know. I appreciate
the respect.

1045
01:10:07.794 --> 01:10:10.497
but you can touch me.

1046
01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:15.501
- You are so cute.
- I'm nervous.

1047
01:10:15.535 --> 01:10:18.372
We don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

1048
01:10:18.405 --> 01:10:19.939
No. I'm good.

1049
01:10:19.973 --> 01:10:21.875
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1050
01:10:28.615 --> 01:10:30.416
- So. you have fun. then?
- Yes!

1051
01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:32.352
Oh my God. I want to go there
every week.

1052
01:10:32.384 --> 01:10:33.352
It was incredible.

1053
01:10:33.385 --> 01:10:34.787
- It felt so...
- Free?

1054
01:10:34.821 --> 01:10:36.290
Yes!

1055
01:10:36.322 --> 01:10:38.392
Like nobody cared
what you were doing

1056
01:10:38.424 --> 01:10:40.069
- or who you were doing it with.
- Yeah. it's called

1057
01:10:40.093 --> 01:10:42.696
being inclusive
and non-judgmental.

1058
01:10:42.728 --> 01:10:45.064
Right. yeah. guess I haven't
really experienced

1059
01:10:45.098 --> 01:10:46.300
all that much of that.

1060
01:10:46.332 --> 01:10:48.669
Ugh. that makes me really sad.

1061
01:10:48.701 --> 01:10:50.070
But it's probably because

1062
01:10:50.103 --> 01:10:51.413
you've only ever been
to straight clubs

1063
01:10:51.437 --> 01:10:54.407
and you can't be yourself.

1064
01:10:54.441 --> 01:10:57.077
Anyway. this is me.

1065
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:59.612
Oh. well. thanks.

1066
01:10:59.646 --> 01:11:01.048
I had a really good time
tonight.

1067
01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.348
Good.

1068
01:11:02.381 --> 01:11:04.485
We should do this again
sometime.

1069
01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.689
Do you want to come up?

1070
01:11:10.055 --> 01:11:11.857
Like to your apartment?

1071
01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:14.494
Like to my bedroom?

1072
01:11:17.129 --> 01:11:19.432
Oh.

1073
01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:23.704
What happens next?

1074
01:11:23.737 --> 01:11:25.605
Whatever you want.

1075
01:11:41.153 --> 01:11:43.557
So. what's going on?

1076
01:11:44.957 --> 01:11:46.727
Sorry.

1077
01:11:48.728 --> 01:11:50.430
I just...

1078
01:11:50.463 --> 01:11:53.599
I needed to talk to you
and I wanted to do it alone

1079
01:11:53.633 --> 01:11:57.871
without your backup.
so thanks for coming over.

1080
01:11:57.903 --> 01:12:00.107
You know.
she's probably watching.

1081
01:12:00.139 --> 01:12:02.375
She's everywhere.

1082
01:12:02.409 --> 01:12:03.777
Yeah.

1083
01:12:05.144 --> 01:12:08.013
So what do you need to say?

1084
01:12:08.046 --> 01:12:09.715
I'm sorry.

1085
01:12:11.084 --> 01:12:14.988
I guess that's
pretty long overdue.

1086
01:12:15.021 --> 01:12:18.759
I just didn't really have
the courage before now.

1087
01:12:18.791 --> 01:12:20.393
But I'm not gonna make excuses.

1088
01:12:20.427 --> 01:12:22.661
I...

1089
01:12:22.695 --> 01:12:25.732
That night that we. uh...

1090
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.001
Yeah.

1091
01:12:28.034 --> 01:12:30.871
Look. what I did.

1092
01:12:30.903 --> 01:12:34.140
what I said. it was wrong.

1093
01:12:34.174 --> 01:12:36.042
and I'm sorry.

1094
01:12:36.075 --> 01:12:37.911
You didn't deserve that.

1095
01:12:37.943 --> 01:12:39.780
I was a dick.

1096
01:12:39.812 --> 01:12:41.180
Wow.

1097
01:12:41.214 --> 01:12:43.582
Um...

1098
01:12:43.616 --> 01:12:45.051
Thank you.

1099
01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:47.019
I appreciate it

1100
01:12:47.053 --> 01:12:48.921
because you were a dick.

1101
01:12:50.522 --> 01:12:54.860
But I should've asked
more questions.

1102
01:12:54.893 --> 01:12:57.930
I knew something was up.

1103
01:12:57.964 --> 01:13:00.167
So. I'm sorry too.

1104
01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.803
You needed a friend.
not a quickie.

1105
01:13:04.237 --> 01:13:07.007
I would take a friend. though.

1106
01:13:08.607 --> 01:13:09.909
You got it.

1107
01:13:13.112 --> 01:13:15.482
You're such a nerd.

1108
01:13:17.584 --> 01:13:18.652
- Hey.
- Hi!

1109
01:13:20.987 --> 01:13:23.523
So. uh. last night...

1110
01:13:23.555 --> 01:13:26.125
Was fun and spontaneous.

1111
01:13:26.159 --> 01:13:28.995
Absolutely. uh.

1112
01:13:29.027 --> 01:13:30.763
and I think that we should
talk about it.

1113
01:13:30.796 --> 01:13:32.933
Sure!

1114
01:13:32.965 --> 01:13:34.468
Okay.

1115
01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.035
Okay. so we. um...

1116
01:13:36.068 --> 01:13:38.071
- Had sex.
- Yes.

1117
01:13:38.103 --> 01:13:40.506
And. uh...

1118
01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:41.842
What does that mean?

1119
01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:45.011
It means that we had sex.

1120
01:13:45.044 --> 01:13:46.646
Right. Right. right.

1121
01:13:46.679 --> 01:13:48.882
But... but what does that...
what does that mean?

1122
01:13:48.915 --> 01:13:51.551
Like. um. like. are we dating?

1123
01:13:51.584 --> 01:13:53.954
Uh. are you my girlfriend?

1124
01:13:53.987 --> 01:13:56.723
- Uh...
- Do we talk about it?

1125
01:13:56.755 --> 01:13:57.967
Do you not want
to talk about it?

1126
01:13:57.991 --> 01:14:00.894
Okay. okay. okay.
you are so cute.

1127
01:14:00.927 --> 01:14:03.563
Okay. first of all.
we can talk about everything

1128
01:14:03.595 --> 01:14:05.698
and anything. okay?

1129
01:14:05.732 --> 01:14:07.000
And. secondly. I think

1130
01:14:07.032 --> 01:14:09.503
that you might be panicking
a little.

1131
01:14:09.536 --> 01:14:12.539
We had sex last night
and it doesn't have to be

1132
01:14:12.571 --> 01:14:14.106
anything more than that.

1133
01:14:14.139 --> 01:14:15.976
- It doesn't?
- No.

1134
01:14:16.009 --> 01:14:19.713
Two people can find each other
attractive and just have sex.

1135
01:14:19.745 --> 01:14:23.115
I mean. do you want
a relationship?

1136
01:14:23.148 --> 01:14:27.019
No. I don't. actually.

1137
01:14:27.053 --> 01:14:29.155
Okay. so are we
just friends. then?

1138
01:14:29.187 --> 01:14:30.689
Absolutely.

1139
01:14:30.723 --> 01:14:33.793
And we can be
whatever we want to be.

1140
01:14:33.826 --> 01:14:35.829
Does that work for you?

1141
01:14:35.862 --> 01:14:38.031
Yes. that works for me.

1142
01:14:39.765 --> 01:14:41.110
I still really need a tutor.
though.

1143
01:14:41.134 --> 01:14:43.670
Yeah. you do really need
a tutor.

1144
01:14:45.604 --> 01:14:47.107
Okay. where are you at today?

1145
01:14:47.139 --> 01:14:49.608
Oh my God. not much further
than I was last time.

1146
01:14:49.642 --> 01:14:51.044
What is this?

1147
01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.050
You know. you don't
have to knock every time.

1148
01:14:58.084 --> 01:15:00.253
I wasn't really sure
if I was gonna go in.

1149
01:15:00.286 --> 01:15:02.289
Well. you showed up.
so that's a good start.

1150
01:15:02.321 --> 01:15:04.256
- Is it?
- Do you want to hang out here.

1151
01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:06.092
or you can follow me in?

1152
01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:09.262
I'll pretend not to notice.

1153
01:15:09.295 --> 01:15:12.198
I guess I can keep
the back row warm.

1154
01:15:12.231 --> 01:15:14.067
You're very kind.

1155
01:15:19.938 --> 01:15:23.209
Here we have
your premium back row seat.

1156
01:15:29.781 --> 01:15:32.052
Hey. how's it going? Thank you.

1157
01:15:37.924 --> 01:15:39.192
Hello. everyone.

1158
01:15:39.224 --> 01:15:42.294
Thank you so much
for coming tonight.

1159
01:15:42.327 --> 01:15:44.764
Would anyone like
to start us off?

1160
01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.936
I would.

1161
01:15:49.969 --> 01:15:52.306
Awesome. Please do.

1162
01:16:02.048 --> 01:16:03.148
Should I stand up?

1163
01:16:03.182 --> 01:16:05.152
You can do whatever you want.

1164
01:16:15.094 --> 01:16:16.196
Okay.

1165
01:16:16.228 --> 01:16:18.063
Um...

1166
01:16:18.097 --> 01:16:20.265
So I'm Erin.

1167
01:16:20.299 --> 01:16:22.235
And. uh...

1168
01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:27.206
This is all very new for me.

1169
01:16:29.008 --> 01:16:30.943
I guess I've never
really allowed myself

1170
01:16:30.977 --> 01:16:34.147
to feel these feelings before...

1171
01:16:39.852 --> 01:16:41.220
until I met this person

1172
01:16:41.254 --> 01:16:44.290
that shifted my entire outlook
on the world

1173
01:16:44.322 --> 01:16:46.726
and on everything.

1174
01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.063
I tried really hard to bury it.

1175
01:16:51.097 --> 01:16:55.835
but I just haven't been able
to keep ignoring it.

1176
01:16:59.738 --> 01:17:04.878
I tried so hard to not.
you know. to not be...

1177
01:17:06.978 --> 01:17:08.682
You know...

1178
01:17:10.383 --> 01:17:12.986
God. I'm scared.

1179
01:17:13.018 --> 01:17:17.956
I'm so fucking scared.

1180
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:21.995
And I just haven't been able
to even say the words or...

1181
01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:28.333
or be able to even really

1182
01:17:28.366 --> 01:17:32.438
let myself be this way.

1183
01:17:36.776 --> 01:17:38.111
And I just can't
do this anymore.

1184
01:17:38.143 --> 01:17:39.713
And...

1185
01:17:42.314 --> 01:17:45.751
I've never been able
to admit this. but I just...

1186
01:17:47.487 --> 01:17:49.456
God. I feel like
I'm suffocating.

1187
01:17:49.488 --> 01:17:52.424
I feel like I can't breathe...

1188
01:17:54.059 --> 01:17:58.363
like I can't keep up
this lie anymore. and...

1189
01:18:00.433 --> 01:18:02.902
I think this is it.

1190
01:18:02.934 --> 01:18:07.874
I think this is it. I think
this is my coming out story.

1191
01:18:07.906 --> 01:18:09.875
Right now.

1192
01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.349
So. I. uh...

1193
01:18:22.287 --> 01:18:23.923
can't keep
doing this anymore.

1194
01:18:23.955 --> 01:18:27.793
so I'm gonna... I'm gonna
finally say this.

1195
01:18:31.363 --> 01:18:33.299
I'm gay.

1196
01:18:42.441 --> 01:18:43.943
I'm gay.

1197
01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:47.446
Do you have a Jack?

1198
01:18:47.479 --> 01:18:50.150
Read 'em and weep.
motherfuckers.

1199
01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:52.318
I win again.

1200
01:18:52.351 --> 01:18:53.786
I think you're making up
the rules.

1201
01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:55.854
It's bullshit.

1202
01:18:55.888 --> 01:18:57.957
Hey. y'all should be
used to it by now.

1203
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:59.992
I win every time.

1204
01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:03.062
I live in hope.

1205
01:19:03.094 --> 01:19:04.496
Hey. get me more beer. please.

1206
01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:06.331
Beer. yes. definitely.

1207
01:19:10.369 --> 01:19:15.474
So. any more sexy time
rendezvous with Billie lately?

1208
01:19:17.043 --> 01:19:19.379
Maybe.

1209
01:19:19.411 --> 01:19:21.390
No. you know. this is actually
a really cool feeling.

1210
01:19:21.414 --> 01:19:24.951
not being heartbroken.
no obligations.

1211
01:19:24.983 --> 01:19:26.919
not worrying about Erin.

1212
01:19:28.353 --> 01:19:29.931
I think I finally feel
like myself. you know.

1213
01:19:29.955 --> 01:19:32.191
like who I'm supposed to be.

1214
01:19:32.224 --> 01:19:33.425
Does that make sense?

1215
01:19:33.459 --> 01:19:36.162
Yeah. it makes a lot of sense.

1216
01:19:36.195 --> 01:19:38.097
I'm happy for you.

1217
01:19:40.031 --> 01:19:41.601
- All right. there you go.
- Yes.

1218
01:19:41.634 --> 01:19:43.369
Wait. that's yours.

1219
01:19:44.903 --> 01:19:47.607
I don't trust you.
I want that one.

1220
01:19:47.639 --> 01:19:50.410
- No.
- What do you mean?

1221
01:19:50.442 --> 01:19:52.077
You did something. I know it.

1222
01:19:52.111 --> 01:19:53.580
Cheers. cheers.

1223
01:19:53.612 --> 01:19:56.348
Drink your own spit.

1224
01:20:13.933 --> 01:20:16.069
Hi.

1225
01:20:16.102 --> 01:20:17.903
What are you doing here?

1226
01:20:17.937 --> 01:20:20.273
I needed to talk to you.

1227
01:20:20.305 --> 01:20:22.442
Wow. well. you could call me.

1228
01:20:22.474 --> 01:20:25.344
I needed to see you as well.

1229
01:20:28.647 --> 01:20:31.383
What's going on. Erin?
It's late.

1230
01:20:31.416 --> 01:20:32.451
I missed you.

1231
01:20:32.485 --> 01:20:35.921
Mm. okay.

1232
01:20:35.955 --> 01:20:37.591
Are you drunk?

1233
01:20:40.492 --> 01:20:43.463
Okay. come on. Come on.

1234
01:20:59.978 --> 01:21:01.647
Okay. what's up?

1235
01:21:06.518 --> 01:21:09.521
No. no. no. no.

1236
01:21:09.554 --> 01:21:11.189
No.

1237
01:21:16.594 --> 01:21:18.597
Just listen to me
for a minute. please.

1238
01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:21.467
'cause there's something
that I need to say.

1239
01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.336
Okay.

1240
01:21:26.171 --> 01:21:29.241
I've been thinking and learning
a lot about myself.

1241
01:21:29.275 --> 01:21:33.312
and I came here tonight
because...

1242
01:21:34.647 --> 01:21:37.317
because.

1243
01:21:37.349 --> 01:21:41.120
because I needed
to tell you something.

1244
01:21:44.089 --> 01:21:48.226
I needed to tell you
that I figured it out.

1245
01:21:48.259 --> 01:21:50.495
Figured what out?

1246
01:21:50.528 --> 01:21:53.131
That I can't hide anymore.

1247
01:21:53.165 --> 01:21:54.500
I can't hide who I am.

1248
01:21:54.532 --> 01:21:57.536
I came out today
to complete strangers

1249
01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:00.106
and it felt really good.

1250
01:22:01.773 --> 01:22:03.675
I realized that this entire time

1251
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:07.213
I thought that I was afraid
of you and of us.

1252
01:22:07.245 --> 01:22:09.681
but really.
I was just afraid of things

1253
01:22:09.714 --> 01:22:11.351
that I couldn't control.

1254
01:22:11.384 --> 01:22:12.685
So I'm ready. I'm ready.

1255
01:22:12.718 --> 01:22:16.356
I'm ready for... for us.

1256
01:22:16.388 --> 01:22:19.092
I'm ready for you to give me

1257
01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:20.369
all the things
you wanted to give me.

1258
01:22:20.393 --> 01:22:22.762
I'm ready for you to love me.

1259
01:22:26.432 --> 01:22:28.067
Wow.

1260
01:22:29.602 --> 01:22:32.738
Um. that took a lot.

1261
01:22:34.139 --> 01:22:36.342
I know that.

1262
01:22:36.375 --> 01:22:38.052
But you can't expect
that we can just pick up

1263
01:22:38.076 --> 01:22:39.711
like nothing happened.

1264
01:22:39.745 --> 01:22:42.148
No. I know. I know. I. um.

1265
01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:47.186
I was really selfish and unfair.

1266
01:22:47.219 --> 01:22:49.622
and I'm so sorry.

1267
01:22:49.655 --> 01:22:52.125
And if you'll just. uh.

1268
01:22:52.157 --> 01:22:55.327
if you'll just let me
prove to you that I...

1269
01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:59.098
Erin. I'm not looking
for an apology. okay?

1270
01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:00.741
And I'm not saying this
to try and punish you.

1271
01:23:00.765 --> 01:23:04.070
I'm genuinely happy for you.

1272
01:23:04.103 --> 01:23:05.204
Okay.

1273
01:23:05.237 --> 01:23:07.740
So give me another chance.

1274
01:23:07.772 --> 01:23:10.809
No. it's... it's not about
giving you another chance.

1275
01:23:10.843 --> 01:23:12.577
Okay. then what is it?

1276
01:23:12.611 --> 01:23:14.280
What is it about?

1277
01:23:18.416 --> 01:23:21.286
It's been months. Erin.

1278
01:23:23.089 --> 01:23:27.427
You haven't spoken to me
in months.

1279
01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:28.628
Okay?

1280
01:23:30.129 --> 01:23:32.497
A lot has changed.

1281
01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.736
But you still love me. right?

1282
01:23:40.638 --> 01:23:43.342
This is what you wanted!

1283
01:23:43.375 --> 01:23:44.744
I am giving you what you wanted.

1284
01:23:44.777 --> 01:23:47.180
No. I wanted you to be yourself.

1285
01:23:47.213 --> 01:23:49.182
For you.

1286
01:23:49.214 --> 01:23:51.784
You've taken this amazing step.

1287
01:23:51.817 --> 01:23:54.687
But you need to do it for you.

1288
01:23:54.719 --> 01:23:56.421
not because you think
it's what I want.

1289
01:23:56.455 --> 01:23:58.224
I mean. I'm not the one
who suffers here.

1290
01:23:58.256 --> 01:24:01.227
If you can't accept yourself...

1291
01:24:01.259 --> 01:24:02.494
I've been down that road.

1292
01:24:02.527 --> 01:24:03.695
I'm not...

1293
01:24:03.728 --> 01:24:06.098
I can't do that again.

1294
01:24:07.532 --> 01:24:09.634
I don't understand.

1295
01:24:09.668 --> 01:24:12.772
I don't understand.
I thought that you'd be happy.

1296
01:24:12.804 --> 01:24:16.741
I thought that you would be...

1297
01:24:18.376 --> 01:24:19.411
Waiting for you?

1298
01:24:27.286 --> 01:24:28.286
Oh my God.

1299
01:24:29.687 --> 01:24:31.389
Oh my God.

1300
01:24:34.759 --> 01:24:36.862
I can't breathe.

1301
01:24:39.464 --> 01:24:41.700
I don't know what to do.

1302
01:24:43.768 --> 01:24:45.570
I...

1303
01:24:45.603 --> 01:24:49.207
I need you. I can't do this
without you.

1304
01:24:49.241 --> 01:24:50.801
I don't know how to do this
without you.

1305
01:24:53.912 --> 01:24:56.314
It's okay.

1306
01:24:56.348 --> 01:24:57.750
It's okay.

1307
01:24:59.751 --> 01:25:01.687
It's okay.

1308
01:25:03.388 --> 01:25:05.624
It's okay. it's okay. it's okay.

1309
01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:23.742
Good morning.

1310
01:25:23.776 --> 01:25:25.811
Did you sleep on the couch?

1311
01:25:25.844 --> 01:25:26.844
Yeah.

1312
01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:31.551
Thanks.

1313
01:25:31.584 --> 01:25:33.653
How are you?

1314
01:25:36.688 --> 01:25:39.424
Embarrassed.

1315
01:25:39.457 --> 01:25:42.228
Sad.

1316
01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.830
Mostly embarrassed. yup.

1317
01:25:44.862 --> 01:25:47.465
Yeah.

1318
01:25:47.499 --> 01:25:49.736
That was. um...

1319
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:54.207
Um...

1320
01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.707
I'm sorry.

1321
01:25:55.741 --> 01:25:58.778
Coming over like that
last night. it was shitty.

1322
01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:03.782
And. um. do you think that
maybe we could try and have

1323
01:26:03.816 --> 01:26:06.419
that conversation again?

1324
01:26:06.451 --> 01:26:07.820
Um...

1325
01:26:07.853 --> 01:26:09.589
Erin...

1326
01:26:11.656 --> 01:26:15.660
You may have been drunk
and upset. but...

1327
01:26:16.995 --> 01:26:19.731
my words aren't gonna change.

1328
01:26:26.772 --> 01:26:31.477
I will never forget...

1329
01:26:33.411 --> 01:26:36.915
that you're the first person
that I ever loved...

1330
01:26:40.052 --> 01:26:42.955
and you're the first woman
I ever slept with.

1331
01:26:45.723 --> 01:26:47.392
But...

1332
01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:50.896
I need to move forward.

1333
01:26:53.799 --> 01:26:57.503
What we had. it was...

1334
01:26:57.536 --> 01:27:01.841
intense and terrifying...

1335
01:27:03.909 --> 01:27:06.711
and unhealthy.

1336
01:27:06.745 --> 01:27:08.347
And...

1337
01:27:09.881 --> 01:27:13.786
And perhaps maybe you think
you need to be with me

1338
01:27:13.818 --> 01:27:14.687
because I was your first.

1339
01:27:14.719 --> 01:27:16.354
but it doesn't need
to be that way.

1340
01:27:16.388 --> 01:27:19.725
it doesn't need to be
all or nothing

1341
01:27:19.758 --> 01:27:23.362
or painful or dramatic.

1342
01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:29.768
I think. for me.

1343
01:27:29.802 --> 01:27:33.673
I need stability...

1344
01:27:36.474 --> 01:27:37.942
I need to explore.

1345
01:27:37.976 --> 01:27:40.946
and I need to learn who I am.

1346
01:27:40.978 --> 01:27:42.647
And...

1347
01:27:45.451 --> 01:27:47.019
I just...

1348
01:27:49.354 --> 01:27:50.955
I just don't...
I just don't think

1349
01:27:50.988 --> 01:27:53.491
that I could do that with you.

1350
01:27:55.794 --> 01:27:57.028
I'm sorry.

1351
01:27:58.429 --> 01:28:00.799
I'm sorry.

1352
01:28:00.832 --> 01:28:04.070
I know that you wanted this
to go a different way.

1353
01:28:06.839 --> 01:28:10.743
No. I. uh. I get it. yeah.

1354
01:28:12.878 --> 01:28:14.580
But. um...

1355
01:28:16.147 --> 01:28:17.949
Maybe one day?

1356
01:28:19.617 --> 01:28:22.487
Maybe one day.

1357
01:28:25.557 --> 01:28:27.660
But not now.

1358
01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.795
Right.

1359
01:28:35.701 --> 01:28:37.770
We're going to be okay.

1360
01:28:37.803 --> 01:28:39.438
Okay?

1361
01:28:42.607 --> 01:28:46.578
You are gonna be okay.

1362
01:29:13.638 --> 01:29:15.740
Hey. Jule.

1363
01:29:15.773 --> 01:29:17.642
Do you think
we can meet up later?

1364
01:29:17.675 --> 01:29:19.745
There's something
I want to tell you.
