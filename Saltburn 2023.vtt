00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:01.125
I wasn't in love with him.

4
00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:03.833
<i>I know everyone thought I was.</i>

5
00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:06.833
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

6
00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:10.166
<i>I loved him. of course.</i>

7
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.291
<i>It was impossible
not to love Felix.</i>

8
00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:17.083
<i>And that was part
of the problem.</i>

9
00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:18.666
<i>Everyone loved him.</i>

10
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.375
<i>Everyone wanted to
be around him.</i>

11
00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:22.833
<i>It exhausted him.</i>

12
00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.916
<i>People just wouldn't
leave him alone.</i>

13
00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:28.416
<i>Especially the girls.</i>

14
00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:31.083
<i>Christ. the girls!</i>

15
00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:34.083
<i>It was embarrassing. really.
how everyone fawned over him.</i>

16
00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:38.208
<i>I think. honestly. that's why
he liked me so much.</i>

17
00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:40.500
<i>I protected him.</i>

18
00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:42.916
<i>I was honest with him.</i>

19
00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:44.333
<i>I understood him.</i>

20
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:47.208
<i>I loved him.</i>

21
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.875
<i>I loved him.</i>

22
00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:55.666
But was I "in love" with him?

Sorry.

I'm Michael Gavey.

Oliver.

56
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.500
- Oliver what?
- Oliver Quick.

57
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.083
So you're a Norman no-mates
too. then. Oliver Quick?

58
00:05:19.083 --> 00:05:21.291
Isn't everyone?

59
00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:23.333
- It's only the first night.
- Look around you.

60
00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:27.500
It's just me and you. mate.

who's got agoraphobia.

62
00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:31.250
but she's in her room. Obviously.

63
00:05:32.208 --> 00:05:33.708
- What are you reading?
- Er...

64
00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:34.916
I'm reading Maths.

65
00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:36.541
I'm a genius.

66
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:38.250
I don't even
like Maths. really.

67
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.125
I can just do it. In my head.

68
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:42.250
Anything. Ask me a sum.

69
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.708
- No. you're okay.
- Oh. come on.

70
00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:46.541
It's... It's not like
I don't believe you.

71
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:48.291
- Please. Come on.
- No. I believe...

72
00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:50.333
Fucking ask me a sum. then!

73
00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:53.833
Er...

74
00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:57.458
423 times 78.

75
00:05:57.916 --> 00:05:59.666

77
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.250
Good.

78
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.708
Yeah. good.

79
00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:15.791
- Hmm.
- Thanks.

80
00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:19.125
Did you come
from far from home?

81
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:21.541
Prescot.

82
00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:24.125
- Yeah. where?
- Er. Prescot.

83
00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:27.208
- Merseyside.
- Ah.

84
00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:28.708
Never been.

85
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:31.041
Never been.

86
00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:34.958
Prescot.

87
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.208
So. how did you get on
with the summer reading list?

88
00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:41.750
Er. yeah. Okay. I think.

89
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.916
I read it all.

90
00:06:43.416 --> 00:06:44.791
- What. all of it?
- Mmm-hmm.

91
00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:46.833
Fifty books on there.
Are you mad?

92
00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:48.833
- I thought we're supposed to.
- King James Bible is on there.

93
00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:50.333
Telling me you
spent your whole summer

94
00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:51.416
reading the Bible?

95
00:06:51.416 --> 00:06:53.083
The reading list is optional.

96
00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:55.541
I've not read
half the books on there.

97
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:57.166
- Sorry.

98
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.583
Any idea where he's got to?
He's 20 minutes late now.

99
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.791
Right. well. I suppose we'd
better make a start. then.

100
00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:09.083
I'm so sorry. Sorry I'm late.
Sorry I'm late.

101
00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:10.458
I'm so sorry.

102
00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:11.750
Got completely lost.

103
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.291
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:17.416
You're Farleigh Start.
I take it?

105
00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:19.041
Nice of you to join us. finally.

106
00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:22.250
You're not a
relation of. er.

107
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.916
Frederica Start.
by any chance?

108
00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:25.291
Er. she's my mother.

109
00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:26.375
No!

110
00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:28.500
I knew her
when I was your age.

111
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.041
When we were both here.

112
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:32.791
When she was Frederica Catton.
Before she went to America.

113
00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:34.041
No way!

114
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:36.500
Oh. my God. I'll tell her.

115
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.750
She's gonna be thrilled
that I'm being

116
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.333
tutored by one of her friends.

117
00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:41.791
Oh. no. not. er. friend.

118
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.250
More. er... admirer.

119
00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:47.083
Yeah. from afar.

120
00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:50.333
Not sure we ever spoke.

121
00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:52.666
No. don't even mention me.

122
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.250
Shall we start?

123
00:07:58.458 --> 00:08:00.708
"G.K. Chesterton
would have it.

124
00:08:00.708 --> 00:08:02.875
"This outrageous
gallop of lines.

125
00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:04.541
"And thus.

126
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:06.000
-"the shape of the verse...

127
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.833
"...can be said like
Browning's <i>Last Duchess</i>

128
00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:10.125
"to look as if
it 'were alive'."

129
00:08:11.916 --> 00:08:13.916
- Okay. Yeah.

130
00:08:13.916 --> 00:08:15.583
Very good. Erm...

131
00:08:16.666 --> 00:08:21.416
Yeah. a lot of food
for thought there. Intriguing.

132
00:08:21.416 --> 00:08:23.083
And thus...

133
00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:26.208
Hmm?

134
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:28.666
Sorry. Er. just "thus".

135
00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:29.833
It's just a funny word.

136
00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:32.208
- Why?
I don't know.

137
00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:34.791
I don't think we really use it
in real life. do we?

138
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:37.708
It's just. kind of. verbose.
don't you think?

139
00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:39.708
- No. Not really.
- No.

140
00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:42.541
No. you don't.
You used it seven times.

141
00:08:42.541 --> 00:08:44.250
- No. I didn't.
-  Yes. you did.

142
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.541
I counted.

143
00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.333
He's got you there.
I'm afraid. Oliver.

144
00:08:48.833 --> 00:08:51.000
So. you're picking apart
the style of my essay

145
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.750
instead of the substance?

146
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.708
That's kind of...

147
00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:56.083
- Kind of what?
- Lazy?

148
00:08:56.083 --> 00:08:57.958
It's completely
valid to debate

149
00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.291
the rhetoric of an argument.

150
00:08:59.291 --> 00:09:00.958
It's not what you argue
but how.

151
00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.625
Great point.
Yeah.

152
00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.125
Especially if you haven't
actually read the poems.

153
00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.416
Look forward
to hearing your essay.

155
00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:40.208

157
00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:44.750
Oh. thanks.

00:09:47.208 --> 00:09:49.208

Christmas party tonight?

160

NFI. me and you.

161
00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:55.208
Not fucking invited.

162
00:09:55.916 --> 00:09:58.250
- I'm sure anyone can go.
- Oh. no.

163
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.833
It's invitation only. apparently.

164
00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.166
You get an invite
in your pigeon hole?

165
00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:03.875
- Haven't checked.
- I have. You didn't.

166
00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:06.083

167
00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:08.125
- Like we wanted to go. anyway.
- Yeah.

168
00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:10.250
As if we actually want to talk
to those vapid cunts.

169
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.583
- Nah. we can make our own fun.

170
00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:14.625
- can't we?
- Yeah.

171
00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:16.625

You all right?

181
00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:03.083
Erm. yeah.
I've got a flat tyre.

182
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:05.125
- Oh. That's bad luck.
- Yeah.

183
00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:07.333
I've just been trying
to fix it.

184
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.416
Yeah. of course.
it's when I'm already

185
00:11:08.416 --> 00:11:10.208
ten minutes late
for my tutorial.

186
00:11:10.208 --> 00:11:11.750
Fuck!

187
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.833
Where is it?

188
00:11:12.833 --> 00:11:14.625
Er. it's Iffley Road.

189
00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.791
- Shit.
- Yeah.

190
00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:18.875
I'm already in it
for skiving last week. so...

191
00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:28.541
Look. I'm not really
going anywhere.

192
00:11:28.541 --> 00:11:30.958
Just taking these
back to the library.

193
00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.291
Take my bike.

194
00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:37.416
No. no. no. I couldn't.
I mean. it looks like rain.

195
00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:39.958
- I wouldn't want to...
- Honestly. it's no big deal.

196
00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.083
I mean. I'll just get it
from you later.

197
00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:44.291
- You're in my college. so...
- Am I?

198
00:11:45.583 --> 00:11:46.625
Yep.

199
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.500
Fuck. that's kind.
Are you serious?

200
00:11:50.875 --> 00:11:52.375
Mate. that is so kind.
Thank you.

201
00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:53.458
Are you sure?

202
00:11:53.458 --> 00:11:55.375
I mean. it's a bit of a faff
wheeling it back to college.

203
00:11:56.166 --> 00:11:58.041
You want me
to take yours back?

204
00:11:58.041 --> 00:12:00.666
Oh. no. no. no. I...
I'm sorry. I just thought...

205
00:12:00.666 --> 00:12:02.708
I mean. I can wheel it
back to college.

206
00:12:02.708 --> 00:12:05.083
- It's not that far.
- Oh. thank you.

207
00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:06.583
Thank you. I'm sorry.
I don't know your name.

208
00:12:06.583 --> 00:12:08.416
- I'm... I'm Felix.
- Oliver.

209
00:12:08.416 --> 00:12:09.833
- Oliver. Oliver.
- Yeah.

210
00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:11.291
- Oliver. I love you.

211
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:12.916
- I love...
- Yeah...

212
00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:14.166
I love you.

213
00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.416
I love you. I love you. Seriously.

214
00:12:15.416 --> 00:12:17.083
- Okay.
- Thank you so much. mate.

215
00:12:17.083 --> 00:12:20.416
So kind. You're a fucking
life-saver. really. Thank you.

216
00:12:20.416 --> 00:12:22.750
All right. I'll just leave
yours in the bike shed. yeah?

217
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.666
- Yeah. Fine.
- All right. cheers. Ollie!

218
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.916
Jameson spends the whole time
staring at her tits.

219
00:12:36.916 --> 00:12:38.375
completely ignoring the fact

220
00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:41.000
she can barely
do her times tables.

221
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.291
Times tables. Oliver!

222
00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:44.500
Just fuck off
and do history of art. love.

223
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.333
- Hmm.
- Oliver. Oliver?

224
00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:49.291
- Yeah.
- Not exactly dazzling company.

225
00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:51.375
Sorry.

226
00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:57.458
Ooh! Sweet baby Jesus!

227
00:12:57.458 --> 00:12:58.541
I'm going for a slash.

228
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:00.000
Get me another pint.
please. Oliver?

229
00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:01.750
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

230
00:13:06.458 --> 00:13:08.041
- A pint. mate.
Yeah.

231
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.583
Oh! There he is.
Ollie! Oliver!

232
00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.083
Oliver! Come here. mate!

233
00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:14.166
Yeah. come here.

234
00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:16.791
Come here. What? Come here.

235
00:13:18.125 --> 00:13:19.125
Unreal.

236
00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:21.166
Hiya. mate.

237
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.750
Hi.

238
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.000
This is my fucking hero
right here.

239
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.083
I was just telling everyone

240
00:13:26.083 --> 00:13:27.208
how you saved
my arse yesterday.

241
00:13:27.208 --> 00:13:29.083
So cute.
So cute.

242
00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:30.458
Hey. take a seat.
I owe you a drink.

243
00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:31.750
Here. shove up. yeah.

244
00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:34.208
Oh. sorry.
Are you with a friend?

245
00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:37.333
Er. no. they just left.

246
00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:42.166
So. erm. what college
are you in. mate?

247
00:13:43.666 --> 00:13:44.750
- Yours.
Oh. right.

248
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.125
And. er.
what are you studying?

249
00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:51.458
Shots. Shots. Shots.

250
00:14:06.416 --> 00:14:08.083
Wait. wait. wait. Jägerbombs.

251
00:14:08.083 --> 00:14:10.166
Jägerbombs!

252
00:14:10.666 --> 00:14:12.291
- I...
- It's your round. man.

253
00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:14.000
Yeah. go on. mate.
- I should go to bed.

254
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.750
Wait. no. no. no.

255
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.708
No. you can't snake your way
out of a round.

256
00:14:18.208 --> 00:14:20.666
- I'm... I'm not.
- It looks like you are.

257
00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:25.333
Come on.

258
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.208
Okay! Okay.

259
00:14:32.541 --> 00:14:33.750
- Farleigh.
What?

260
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.791
- Just cut him a break. mate.
- What?

261
00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:38.041
That round's gonna cost
a fucking fortune.

262
00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:39.416
Pub rules. Felix.

263
00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:41.500
It's my round.
I can't.

264
00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:44.750
I can't. I can't go back
and ask them for money.

265
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.166
Not my problem.
I'm asking...

266
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:48.541
Could I just pay you tomorrow?

267
00:14:48.541 --> 00:14:50.208
I'm sorry. mate.
You're not even close.

268
00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:52.833
Oh. please. I'll bring you
the money tomorrow.

269
00:14:52.833 --> 00:14:54.125
No.

270
00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:56.041
- Please? I'm...
Fuck's sake.

271
00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:58.333
Thought you might need a hand
with these ones. mate.

272
00:14:58.333 --> 00:14:59.750
Oh. and you. er.
you dropped this

273
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.166
on the floor by your feet.

274
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:03.541
I was gonna nick it.

275
00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:05.000
but I thought
I'd do the right thing.

276
00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:12.458
Thank you.

277
00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:16.250
I'll. erm.
pay it back tomorrow.

278
00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:20.458
Don't know what
you're talking about. mate.

279
00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.166
Thank you. Ollie!
Whoa!

280
00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:26.333
- Thank you. Ollie. Oh. my God.

281
00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:27.583
Cheers. man.

282
00:15:27.583 --> 00:15:30.166
Ollie! Ollie! Ollie!

283
00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:10.625
<i>Yeah. well. you know.</i>

284
00:16:10.625 --> 00:16:12.000
<i>Farleigh basically
grew up with us.</i>

285
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.916
<i>I didn't know
you and Farleigh were cousins.</i>

286
00:16:13.916 --> 00:16:15.666
Mmm. My aunt.

287
00:16:15.666 --> 00:16:17.291
- Farleigh's mum...
- Mmm-hmm.

288
00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:19.333
...ran away to America
when she was 19

289
00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:21.250
to escape
the cold-hearted English.

290
00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:24.791
- Ciggie?
- Er. don't smoke.

291
00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:27.333
<i>Dear Auntie Fred
married a lunatic</i>

292
00:16:27.333 --> 00:16:28.791
<i>who pissed everything
she had up the wall</i>

293
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:31.208
and a fair chunk
of Dad's money too.

294
00:16:31.208 --> 00:16:33.875
until he had to finally
cut her off.

295
00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:36.000
Sounds like
an Evelyn Waugh novel.

296
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.333
You know.
a lot of Waugh's characters

297
00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:38.625
are based on
my family. actually.

298
00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:41.458
Yeah. he was completely
obsessed with our house.

299
00:16:42.041 --> 00:16:43.041
Well. Dad. you know.

300
00:16:43.041 --> 00:16:45.291
<i>he felt so guilty
about the whole thing that</i>

301
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:47.666
<i>he decided he would pay for
all of Farleigh's education.</i>

302
00:16:47.666 --> 00:16:49.375
Lucky Farleigh.

303
00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.291
<i>Oh. fat lot of good
it's done him.</i>

304
00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:53.208
<i>He's been expelled from almost
every school in England</i>

305
00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:54.416
for sucking off the teachers.

306
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:58.083
<i>How about you?</i>
OLIVER<i>: Er...</i>

307
00:16:58.083 --> 00:16:59.791
I've not sucked
any teachers off.

308
00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:01.125
Not yet. you haven't.

309
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.958
It's DJ Fucking Shadow.

310
00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.750
He's fucking
chronic. mate.

311
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.875
All these
boarding school psychos.

312
00:17:07.875 --> 00:17:09.250
What do they teach you?

313
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.750
Um. Latin.

314
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.333
Water polo.

315
00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:16.000
- And child abuse.

316
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.083
Ah. that's cute.

317
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.625
Baby Felix.

318
00:17:20.833 --> 00:17:22.750
There aren't any pictures
of me as a kid.

319
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.583
<i>Well. I mean. there's not much
really to say.</i>

320
00:17:25.583 --> 00:17:26.958
Oh. come on.
What. are you

321
00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.541
in fucking witness protection
or something?

322
00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:29.625
Jesus Christ. mate.

323
00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:32.166
<i>Well. do you
have any siblings?</i>

324
00:17:32.166 --> 00:17:33.250
<i>What are your parents like?</i>

325
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.791
Siblings. no.

326
00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:38.250
And. er. my parents. I...

327
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.541
What?

328
00:17:39.541 --> 00:17:41.083
...don't see them that much.

329
00:17:41.083 --> 00:17:43.541
- Why?
- Just. er...

330
00:17:43.541 --> 00:17:45.250
<i>they've...</i>

331
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.458
- They've got problems.
- What? What kind of...

332
00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:49.833
- What do you mean. problems?
- Mental health.

333
00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:51.416
<i>And addiction and stuff.</i>

334
00:17:51.416 --> 00:17:53.750
Dad was. kind of.
dealing and stuff.

335
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.083
Dealing?

336
00:17:55.083 --> 00:17:57.000
Sounds awful. really.

337
00:17:58.083 --> 00:17:59.625
- Yeah.
- Was it. was it...

338
00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:01.416
- Was it awful?
- Look. it's...

339
00:18:01.916 --> 00:18:03.208
...it's all tough.

340
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Yeah.

341
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.500
Fuck 'em.

342
00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.375
You're a fucking
inspiration. mate.

343
00:18:12.375 --> 00:18:13.666
Seriously.

344
00:18:13.666 --> 00:18:14.916
Thank you.
Very cool.

345
00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:20.583
Now. can you eenie. meenie
India or Annabel.

346
00:18:20.583 --> 00:18:23.750
and take one fucking home?
Because they look miserable.

347
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.000
Eenie. meenie. miny. moe.

348
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.541
Catch a tiger by his toe.

349
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:29.333
If he squeals. let him go.

350
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.333
Er...

351
00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:33.625
You're out. boy scout.

352
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.083
Well. what the fuck. mate?

353
00:18:43.083 --> 00:18:45.000
I've been chirpsing her
for about an hour.

354
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.583
I wanted at least a handjob.

355
00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:49.166
I know. We all want
a fucking handjob. mate.

356
00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:51.750
Get yourself a title
and a massive fuck off castle.

357
00:18:56.375 --> 00:18:57.541
Oliver Quick.

358
00:19:01.166 --> 00:19:02.291
You look different.

359
00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:05.125
Do I?

360
00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.291
He'll get bored of you.

361
00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:11.958
Excuse me?

362
00:19:16.666 --> 00:19:17.833
Bootlicker.

363
00:19:25.083 --> 00:19:26.583
Can Oliver come?
Maybe.

364
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:27.666
What?

365
00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:30.375
I don't know.
He's just a bit awkward.

366
00:19:30.916 --> 00:19:31.916
He's got zero chat.

367
00:19:31.916 --> 00:19:34.458
Like. who would I even
sit him next to?

368
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.458
I don't know.
One of your hot friends?

369
00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.416
I'm... I'm sorry. Felix.

370
00:19:40.416 --> 00:19:43.250
but no one wants to sit
next to fucking Oliver.

371
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.333
Why not?

372
00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:46.708
'Cause
he's a scholarship boy

373
00:19:46.708 --> 00:19:49.166
who buys his clothes
from Oxfam.

374
00:19:49.833 --> 00:19:52.958
Harsh. That's so harsh.

375
00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.750
- You're such a snob.
Sorry.

376
00:20:35.708 --> 00:20:37.958
- So fucking hot.

377
00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:41.458
I know.

378
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.458
What's that smell?

379
00:20:49.125 --> 00:20:50.833
Erm... I don't know.

380
00:20:53.458 --> 00:20:54.625
No.

381
00:20:54.625 --> 00:20:56.500
- No. no. no.
- What? What are you on about?

382
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.958
It's disgusting. Felix.

383
00:20:57.958 --> 00:20:59.666
- Right. I'm cleaning up.
- It's fine.

384
00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:02.375
Only rich people can afford
to be this filthy.

385
00:21:02.375 --> 00:21:03.666
- Fuck off.
- I mean. you've got

386
00:21:03.666 --> 00:21:04.750
fucking pizza on the floor.

387
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:05.833
Mate. stop it.
I'll do it later. It's fine.

388
00:21:05.833 --> 00:21:08.416
No. you won't. mate.
No. you fucking won't.

389
00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:11.416
- You'll never do it.
- Yes. I will.

390
00:21:11.416 --> 00:21:13.083
- No. you won't.
- Ollie. yes. I will.

391
00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:14.208
- I said I'd do it later.
- No. you won't.

392
00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:16.208
Ollie. fucking stop!
I'm not a fucking child!

393
00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:17.375
I can do it myself!

394
00:21:24.458 --> 00:21:25.875
I'm just... I'm just...

395
00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:28.708
I'm just hot. It's fucking
boiling in these rooms.

396
00:21:28.708 --> 00:21:30.458
They'd rather we all
die of heatstroke

397
00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:32.333
than ruin the fucking
wood fucking panelling

398
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:33.750
by putting in
air conditioning.

399
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.625
Stressing about the exams?

400
00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:37.250
I'm not stressed
about the exams. Ol.

401
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:38.916
You're driving me fucking...

402
00:21:48.291 --> 00:21:51.291
I've got some revising to do.
I think I might. er...

403
00:21:51.291 --> 00:21:52.708
I might catch you later. yeah?

404
00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:57.916
- King's Arms later?
- Yeah. Yeah. maybe. Erm...

405
00:21:57.916 --> 00:21:59.375
I'll text you. yeah?

406
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.500
Okay.

407
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.583

420
00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:19.625
I was just seeing
if Felix was in.

421
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.500
We were supposed to meet.

422
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.916
Er...

423
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.625
Yeah. they're all at the pub.

424
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:27.875
Oh.

425
00:23:27.875 --> 00:23:29.291
Okay.

426
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:30.458
He didn't say.

427
00:23:32.208 --> 00:23:33.250
Was India there?

428
00:23:34.333 --> 00:23:35.333
Yeah.

429
00:23:38.458 --> 00:23:41.125
- Sorry.
-  Oh. God. no.

430
00:23:41.125 --> 00:23:42.208
Whatever.

431
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.416
Do you have any alcohol?

432
00:23:53.875 --> 00:23:55.583
Would you like me
to have alcohol?

433
00:24:09.916 --> 00:24:12.625
Do you think
he'll be jealous?

434
00:24:14.541 --> 00:24:15.541
Honestly?

435
00:24:17.083 --> 00:24:19.458
I don't think it will even
fucking register.

436
00:24:51.791 --> 00:24:52.958
Hi. Mum.

437
00:25:02.291 --> 00:25:03.500
Ollie. what's happened?

438
00:25:08.041 --> 00:25:10.458
- Hey. come here.

439
00:25:13.125 --> 00:25:14.166
How did it happen?

440
00:25:15.541 --> 00:25:17.083
Cracked his head
on the pavement.

441
00:25:19.333 --> 00:25:22.041
Probably drunk. knowing Dad.

442
00:25:22.541 --> 00:25:25.166
-  Fucking hell.
- Or off his fucking tits.

443
00:25:26.041 --> 00:25:27.333
Jeez. I'm...

444
00:25:28.125 --> 00:25:30.000
I'm so sorry. Ollie. that's...

445
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.125
It's just a shock.

446
00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:33.958
Is your mum all right?

447
00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:36.958
She was completely incoherent...

448
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.458
which is pretty
normal for her.

449
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.458
They're gonna
have to let you skip exams.

450
00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:45.250
You're in no state
to do them now.

451
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.750
- I mean. you've gotta go home.
- No.

452
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.166
I can't miss the exams.

453
00:25:49.166 --> 00:25:50.250
Of course you can miss

454
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.083
- the fucking exams.
- No. I can't.

455
00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:53.458
No.

456
00:25:53.458 --> 00:25:55.125
I'm not like you. Felix.

457
00:25:56.208 --> 00:25:57.458
This is all I have.

458
00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:29.458
- Hey. Oliver.
- Hey.

459
00:26:31.625 --> 00:26:34.833
Oh. nice tux.

460
00:26:34.833 --> 00:26:35.916
Thank you.

461
00:26:35.916 --> 00:26:38.375
Wow. It's a rental. right?

462
00:26:38.375 --> 00:26:39.458
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

463
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:42.333
Yeah. the sleeves
are too long.

464
00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:45.875
Always check the sleeves.

465
00:26:47.875 --> 00:26:48.916
But still. not bad.

466
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:51.708
I mean. you're almost passing.

467
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:53.291
For what?

468
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.250
I don't know.

469
00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:57.541
A real human boy.

470
00:27:01.041 --> 00:27:02.083
Hey.

471
00:27:02.083 --> 00:27:03.166
Ollie!

472
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:05.500
- Hiya. mate.
- Hey.

473
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.875
Come on. then. Follow me.

474
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:10.041
Wait. wait. wait.

475
00:27:10.708 --> 00:27:12.791
- Where are we going?

476
00:27:12.791 --> 00:27:14.500
We're gonna
miss the ball. Felix.

477
00:27:19.833 --> 00:27:21.250
What's going on. Felix?

478
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.458
Well. I was thinking
about how I...

479
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:35.291
You... You've had such
a shit time lately

480
00:27:35.291 --> 00:27:36.916
and you've been so brave
about everything. I...

481
00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:39.958
- Oh. Felix. come on.

482
00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:42.833
So in my family.
we have this tradition. right?

483
00:27:42.833 --> 00:27:43.916
When somebody dies.

484
00:27:43.916 --> 00:27:47.000
we write their name on a. er.
on a stone.

485
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.541
and we chuck it in the river.

486
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:50.166
My great-grandfather
started it

487
00:27:50.166 --> 00:27:51.583
when his son died in the war.

488
00:27:51.583 --> 00:27:54.125
I've only done it
for my dog so far. but...

489
00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:56.875
You know.
I don't know. I just...

490
00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:58.208
It helped. a bit.

491
00:28:02.458 --> 00:28:04.625
This feels a bit
fucking stupid now.

492
00:28:04.625 --> 00:28:06.625
No. It's not stupid.

493
00:28:07.833 --> 00:28:08.875
Thank you.

494
00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:11.083
It's something. right?

495
00:28:19.541 --> 00:28:21.125
- So what do I do?
- I don't know really.

496
00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:24.000
Erm. er. I guess you could say
a few words. or...

497
00:28:24.958 --> 00:28:27.750
I mean. we could just stand
here in silence for a bit.

498
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.333
And then you just...
just chuck it in.

499
00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:53.000
- Well. that can't be good.
- Oh.

500
00:28:54.875 --> 00:28:55.875
Fuck.

501
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:02.541
Do you think you'll go home?

502
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:06.333
Honestly?

503
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.041
I don't think
I'll ever go home again.

504
00:29:10.541 --> 00:29:11.708
But what
about your mum?

505
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.000
You know
the first time I felt

506
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.541
the inside of my mum's throat?

507
00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:22.250
I was eight.

508
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
My dad told me

509
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.458
I had to stick my fingers in
to make her sick.

510
00:29:29.791 --> 00:29:31.041
otherwise...

511
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.833
she'd die in her sleep.

512
00:29:37.333 --> 00:29:39.333
So "home" doesn't mean
the same for me

513
00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:41.291
as it does for you. Felix.

514
00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:44.833
The fucking
filth of the place.

515
00:29:44.833 --> 00:29:46.625
the mess. I can't do it.

516
00:29:48.708 --> 00:29:49.750
Just can't.

517
00:29:54.708 --> 00:29:56.500
Well. why don't you
come home with me?

518
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.041
Come to Saltburn.

519
00:29:58.875 --> 00:30:00.208
- No.
- Yeah.

520
00:30:00.208 --> 00:30:01.541
It's too much
of an imposition.

521
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:03.583
Oh. fuck off. it is!
You'll save my sanity.

522
00:30:03.583 --> 00:30:05.041
-  Seriously.
- Oh. it'd feel weird.

523
00:30:05.041 --> 00:30:06.750
It won't feel weird.
I mean. Mum has people

524
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.541
come and stay
for months at a time.

525
00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:10.875
And you know what?
If you get sick of us.

526
00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:12.208
you can leave.

527
00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:15.083
I promise.

528
00:30:17.458 --> 00:30:19.291
<i>And I believed him.</i>

529
00:30:25.958 --> 00:30:27.083
Saltburn.

530
00:31:30.333 --> 00:31:31.333
Mr Quick.

531
00:31:32.333 --> 00:31:33.333
You're early.

532
00:31:33.333 --> 00:31:35.625
Er. I got the earlier train.

533
00:31:36.375 --> 00:31:37.875
Well. do let
us know next time.

534
00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:40.208
You see.
the gates were not open.

535
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.166
That's... That's okay.

536
00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:44.291
We'd sent someone
to pick you up.

537
00:31:45.291 --> 00:31:46.291
Ah.

538
00:31:46.875 --> 00:31:48.291
- Sorry.
- Not at all.

539
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.333
Follow me.

540
00:32:06.208 --> 00:32:07.291
Wow.

541
00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:10.125
This is amazing.

542
00:32:13.041 --> 00:32:14.500
Wow. Wow.

543
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.250
- Just wow.
- Hmm.

544
00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:20.500
Just leave your bag there.

545
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.916
Someone will get it for you.

546
00:32:21.916 --> 00:32:24.833
Ollie!
Thank God you're here.

547
00:32:24.833 --> 00:32:26.416
Duncan. I'll show him
to his room. Don't worry.

548
00:32:26.416 --> 00:32:29.041
Oliver. try not to be
too terrified of Duncan.

549
00:32:29.041 --> 00:32:30.916
Duncan. stop being
so frightening

550
00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:32.041
in front of my friends.

551
00:32:32.041 --> 00:32:33.791
- Well. I'll try. Felix.
Come on. mate.

552
00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:35.875
- Come on.
- He is terrifying.

553
00:32:35.875 --> 00:32:37.833
Oh. he's all right.
He's just odd.

554
00:32:38.708 --> 00:32:39.708
Okay!

555
00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:41.916
So...

556
00:32:42.791 --> 00:32:45.291
Er. red staircase.

557
00:32:45.916 --> 00:32:48.041
I accidentally
fingered my cousin here.

558
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.250
Henry VII's cabinet.

559
00:32:52.916 --> 00:32:54.208
Ghost of Granny.

560
00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:55.291
Hi. Granny.

561
00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.250
Green room. Gardens.

562
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.875
Some fucking hideous Rubens.

563
00:33:01.375 --> 00:33:02.750
Broken piano.

564
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:05.625
Er. blue room.

565
00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:06.708
It's blue.

566
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.500
And King's bedroom.

567
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.875
Actually. the bed still has

568
00:33:12.875 --> 00:33:14.583
some of Henry VIII's
spunk on it.

569
00:33:15.583 --> 00:33:17.083
This is the long gallery.

570
00:33:17.083 --> 00:33:20.291
Er. dead reli. Dead relies.

571
00:33:20.291 --> 00:33:21.833
Daddy's old teddy.

572
00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:24.041
Shakespeare's folio.

573
00:33:24.041 --> 00:33:25.125
And maze.

574
00:33:25.625 --> 00:33:26.916
So. yeah.
we're just through here.

575
00:33:27.416 --> 00:33:28.541
Okay.

576
00:33:29.166 --> 00:33:30.750
Er. my room.

577
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.791
You'll be staying
just next door.

578
00:33:34.541 --> 00:33:35.791
Bathroom.

579
00:33:36.416 --> 00:33:38.083
Ooh. by the way. we're gonna
be sharing a bathroom.

580
00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:39.166
I hope you don't mind.

581
00:33:39.166 --> 00:33:41.416
Otherwise you'd be miles away
on the other end of the house.

582
00:33:43.208 --> 00:33:44.291
Dressing room.

583
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:47.375
And...

584
00:33:49.125 --> 00:33:50.291
your room!

585
00:33:51.875 --> 00:33:52.916
Wow.

586
00:33:55.625 --> 00:33:56.750
I'm glad you're here. mate.

587
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.583
Right. I will. er...
I will leave you to it.

588
00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:03.250
Er. just one thing.

589
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.000
Mum has a phobia
of. er. beards and stubble.

590
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.291
so I left a razor for you
in the bathroom.

591
00:34:08.291 --> 00:34:09.541
- What?
- Yeah. I don't know.

592
00:34:09.541 --> 00:34:11.000
She thinks it's unhygienic.

593
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.416
Er. something to do
with her father.

594
00:34:12.416 --> 00:34:13.500
It's bonkers. I mean...

595
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.625
I'm not even allowed to wear
my fucking stud when I'm here.

596
00:34:16.666 --> 00:34:18.250
Anything else
I should know about?

597
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.125
No. No. just be yourself.

598
00:34:20.125 --> 00:34:22.333
They'll love you.
It's relaxed. I promise.

599
00:34:22.833 --> 00:34:23.833
We'll be in the library.

600
00:34:25.333 --> 00:34:26.375
Library?

601
00:34:41.125 --> 00:34:42.791
<i>McLovin's never existed
'cause that's a made-up</i>

602
00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:44.708
<i>dumb fucking fairy-tale name.
you fuck!</i>

603
00:34:46.708 --> 00:34:49.375
But they might have.
sort of. meetings. I suppose.

604
00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:51.708
Well. I mean. they probably
don't have rehab in Liverpool.

605
00:34:51.708 --> 00:34:53.458
No. gosh. no.
No. I can't imagine they do.

606
00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:55.583
No. see. everybody just
goes to ruin. I suppose.

607
00:34:55.583 --> 00:34:56.666
Where is Liverpool?

608
00:34:56.666 --> 00:34:57.833
I think
it's on the sea. isn't it?

609
00:34:57.833 --> 00:34:59.166
Darling. where's Liverpool?

610
00:35:00.083 --> 00:35:01.916
Er. north.

611
00:35:01.916 --> 00:35:03.125
- North.
Yes.

612
00:35:03.125 --> 00:35:05.208
It's called Prescot.

613
00:35:05.208 --> 00:35:07.458
Oh.
it'll be some awful slum.

614
00:35:07.458 --> 00:35:10.583
Mmm.
A sort of hellish squat.

615
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.625
And both his parents
were dealing.

616
00:35:12.625 --> 00:35:14.750
God. and his mother's a drunk.

617
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.416
I mean. babies
can be really affected.

618
00:35:16.416 --> 00:35:19.041
- Traumatised.
- Oh. they come out drunk.

619
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:20.208
Is that right.
that he had to put his fingers

620
00:35:20.208 --> 00:35:22.125
down his mother's throat
to make her sick?

621
00:35:22.125 --> 00:35:23.541
Farleigh.
that's private stuff.

622
00:35:23.541 --> 00:35:25.875
Well. you told us.
In confidence.

623
00:35:25.875 --> 00:35:27.041
It's awful. darling.

624
00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:28.291
Can you imagine
doing that to me?

625
00:35:28.291 --> 00:35:29.375
I think
that's actually

626
00:35:29.375 --> 00:35:30.541
rather normal
when you're poor.

627
00:35:30.541 --> 00:35:31.625
I think. when you're poor.

628
00:35:31.625 --> 00:35:33.208
that sort of thing
does happen a little bit more.

629
00:35:33.208 --> 00:35:34.291
We should give him

630
00:35:34.291 --> 00:35:35.375
the most wonderful time.

631
00:35:35.375 --> 00:35:37.291
Good luck.
he doesn't smile much.

632
00:35:37.291 --> 00:35:38.750
Farleigh seems
to think he's ghastly.

633
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:40.041
Why are you friends
with him. darling?

634
00:35:40.041 --> 00:35:41.166
Dirt poor. not attractive

635
00:35:41.166 --> 00:35:42.250
and his parents
are drug addicts.

636
00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.000
- I can't actually...
- And here he is now!

637
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.166
We were just
talking about you.

638
00:35:46.166 --> 00:35:47.250
Don't be silly.

639
00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:50.333
Farleigh. you just make up
the most awful things.

640
00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:51.500
Of course we weren't.

641
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.958
Hello. Oliver. darling.

642
00:35:54.375 --> 00:35:56.625
Oh. what beautiful eyes.

643
00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:58.500
Oh. how wonderful!

644
00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.708
Yeah. I told you
he wasn't a minger.

645
00:35:59.708 --> 00:36:02.208
Oh. but. darling.
you're kind about everyone.

646
00:36:02.208 --> 00:36:03.500
You can't be trusted.

647
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.416
Oliver. I have a complete
and utter horror of ugliness.

648
00:36:07.416 --> 00:36:09.541
Ever since I was very young.
I don't know why.

649
00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:11.083
Maybe because
you're a terrible person?

650
00:36:11.083 --> 00:36:12.625
- Don't be mean.

651
00:36:13.416 --> 00:36:15.333
Has Venetia seen you yet?

652
00:36:15.333 --> 00:36:17.166
Oh. my God. she'll die.

653
00:36:17.791 --> 00:36:20.333
She's been draping herself
all around the house all day

654
00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:21.583
hoping you'll come across her.

655
00:36:21.583 --> 00:36:23.708
-  As it were.
- Do stop.

656
00:36:23.708 --> 00:36:25.125
The poor boy's
only just arrived.

657
00:36:25.125 --> 00:36:27.833
Oliver. how good
to finally meet you.

658
00:36:27.833 --> 00:36:29.875
- Trip all right?
- Yes. thank you. sir.

659
00:36:29.875 --> 00:36:31.333
Oh. God.
don't with the "sirs".

660
00:36:31.333 --> 00:36:33.833
No. no. no. we can't stand
anything like that here.

661
00:36:33.833 --> 00:36:35.083
Go on. come and sit by me.

662
00:36:36.208 --> 00:36:37.583
This is my
dear friend. Pamela.

663
00:36:37.583 --> 00:36:38.750
who's been staying with us.

664
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.000
Hey.

665
00:36:41.625 --> 00:36:43.041
Pamela. darling.
will you go and find Annie

666
00:36:43.041 --> 00:36:44.333
and ask about tea?

667
00:36:46.791 --> 00:36:47.791
Yeah.

668
00:36:48.666 --> 00:36:50.625
Yeah. Who. which...
Which one's that?

669
00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:51.916
You'll find her. darling. Annie.

670
00:36:54.458 --> 00:36:55.750
Where's. erm...
- You'll work it out. darling.

671
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:56.833
Okay. I'm going
to work it out.

672
00:36:56.833 --> 00:36:58.458
Kitchen.
Ah. the kitchen.

673
00:36:58.458 --> 00:36:59.875
Kitchen.
So. Annie in the kitchen.

674
00:36:59.875 --> 00:37:00.958
Annie in the kitchen.

675
00:37:02.333 --> 00:37:03.375
Off you pop.
- Okay.

676
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.458
Poor Dear Pamela.
She's been staying with us

677
00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:07.541
while she gets
back on her feet.

678
00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:10.000
She's had an awful time
this year. Hideous.

679
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.166
But. oh. Oliver. so have you.

680
00:37:13.166 --> 00:37:15.625
God. I was so sorry
to hear about your father.

681
00:37:15.625 --> 00:37:17.458
How utterly. utterly tragic.

682
00:37:18.625 --> 00:37:20.583
I've lost so many friends
to addiction.

683
00:37:20.583 --> 00:37:23.083
So. so many dear.
dear friends.

684
00:37:23.083 --> 00:37:25.750
It's the root of Poor Pamela's
horrors too. I'm afraid.

685
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.916
And the only interesting
thing about her.

686
00:37:27.916 --> 00:37:29.291
Farleigh!

687
00:37:29.291 --> 00:37:30.625
No. she is rather dull. actually.

688
00:37:30.625 --> 00:37:31.791
But she's so beautiful.

689
00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:33.833
You have to admit.
she's very beautiful.

690
00:37:33.833 --> 00:37:35.333
But it's only ever
really been a curse.

691
00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:37.750
I mean. the men. Oliver.
you wouldn't believe it.

692
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:40.541
The latest one is some
ghastly Russian billionaire.

693
00:37:40.541 --> 00:37:41.958
Malignantly ugly. of course.

694
00:37:41.958 --> 00:37:45.416
And she's been holed up here
for months hiding from him.

695
00:37:45.416 --> 00:37:47.833
Anyway.
let's not talk about that.

696
00:37:47.833 --> 00:37:49.708
Darling. tell me
about your mother.

697
00:37:49.708 --> 00:37:51.250
How is she bearing up?

698
00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:53.708
- Still drinking?
- Stop!

699
00:37:53.708 --> 00:37:55.541
- Ignore him.
- It's rude.

700
00:37:55.541 --> 00:37:56.708
Nothing shocks me. Oliver.

701
00:37:57.416 --> 00:37:58.708
Absolutely nothing.

702
00:37:58.708 --> 00:37:59.791
Tell me everything.

703
00:38:05.875 --> 00:38:07.166
Fucking hell.

704
00:38:18.416 --> 00:38:19.500
God. Ollie. I'm sorry

705
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.166
Mum asked
so many rude questions.

706
00:38:21.166 --> 00:38:23.000
Don't take it personally.

707
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.875
Someone unpacked my suitcase?

708
00:38:24.875 --> 00:38:27.875
Er... Shit. yes.
I should have told you.

709
00:38:27.875 --> 00:38:29.708
They do that here.

710
00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:31.458
The maids all report
back to Mum. by the way.

711
00:38:31.458 --> 00:38:33.958
so I hope you didn't pack
anything scandalous.

712
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.833
Just my old boxers.

713
00:38:37.833 --> 00:38:39.875
-  God.
- Oh. no. they're used to that.

714
00:38:39.875 --> 00:38:40.958
Don't worry.

715
00:38:41.833 --> 00:38:43.041
Duncan will be thrilled.

716
00:38:45.875 --> 00:38:47.958
Oh. erm...
I hope you don't mind.

717
00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:50.083
I had them hang up
an old school dinner jacket.

718
00:38:50.083 --> 00:38:51.250
We. er...

719
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.333
We dress for dinner here.

720
00:38:52.333 --> 00:38:54.541
so I didn't want you
to be caught short.

721
00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:55.791
Dress for dinner?

722
00:38:55.791 --> 00:38:58.666
Yeah. it's. like...
It's. like. black tie.

723
00:38:59.583 --> 00:39:01.666
- I could've brought one.
- Oh. no. don't be silly.

724
00:39:01.666 --> 00:39:03.416
I mean. I have a spare.
It'd be a waste.

725
00:39:04.791 --> 00:39:05.958
Do you have cufflinks. though?

726
00:39:07.208 --> 00:39:08.208
No.

727
00:39:08.208 --> 00:39:10.375
That's all right.
We'll get it sorted. I'll...

728
00:39:10.375 --> 00:39:12.000
I'll get you some.

729
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.208
I'm really happy
you're here. Ol.

730
00:39:16.208 --> 00:39:18.791
I'm sorry that
everything is so...

731
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:20.666
old-fashioned.

732
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.000
No. it's wonderful.

733
00:39:33.625 --> 00:39:35.458
We met in rehab. so...

734
00:39:35.458 --> 00:39:37.750
He was just so lovely
at first. and then

735
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:38.958
all of his business partners

736
00:39:38.958 --> 00:39:40.916
started. sort of.
falling out of windows.

737
00:39:42.083 --> 00:39:43.625
-  You know.
- Right.

738
00:39:43.625 --> 00:39:46.833
- Lucky escape.
Mmm. I suppose so.

739
00:39:46.833 --> 00:39:48.291
But he spoke Russian
all the time

740
00:39:48.291 --> 00:39:50.000
and it just sounded
so romantic.

741
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
And I don't know
the Russian word for "whore".

742
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.041
so I. sort of. thought
it sounded like lovely poetry.

743
00:39:55.041 --> 00:39:56.125
Yeah.

744
00:39:56.958 --> 00:39:59.250
Daddy always said I'd end up
at the bottom of the Thames.

745
00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.750
So far so good.

746
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.875
I don't know
what I'd do without Elspeth.

747
00:40:02.875 --> 00:40:04.000
She really saved me.

748
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.458
Don't bang on about it.
Pamela. darling.

749
00:40:05.458 --> 00:40:07.166
You know we're delighted
to have you for however long

750
00:40:07.166 --> 00:40:09.708
- it is you mean to stay.
- Forever?

751
00:40:09.708 --> 00:40:12.000
Oh. no. I think I might have.
erm. found somewhere.

752
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.583
- Oh. well done. darling.
- Oh. good.

753
00:40:13.583 --> 00:40:15.250
Yeah. my cousin...
My cousin has a flat.

754
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.375
Oh. that'll suit you
very well. a nice little flat.

755
00:40:17.375 --> 00:40:19.416
It's more of a...
More of a bedsit really.

756
00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:21.291
I loved living
in a bedsit in my 20s.

757
00:40:21.291 --> 00:40:24.041
It's so freeing
to live all in one room.

758
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:25.875
And much less cleaning to do.

759
00:40:25.875 --> 00:40:28.041
Oh. but it'll be terrible
when you're gone.

760
00:40:28.041 --> 00:40:29.208
How will I cope?

761
00:40:29.208 --> 00:40:30.291
Well. I...

762
00:40:30.291 --> 00:40:31.500
I could actually stay
for a little bit longer...

763
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.625
Oh. no. darling. no.

764
00:40:33.625 --> 00:40:35.541
You must be desperate
to be rid of us

765
00:40:35.541 --> 00:40:38.125
and find your own place.
I quite understand.

766
00:41:12.541 --> 00:41:13.541
Hey.

767
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:15.416
Fucking hell.
you gave me a fright.

768
00:41:16.125 --> 00:41:19.333
Sorry. I just thought
you were sleepwalking.

769
00:41:20.333 --> 00:41:22.083
No. I wanted to have a look
at the moon.

770
00:41:26.791 --> 00:41:27.958
It's nearly full.

771
00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:29.541
Do you know what that means?

772
00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:31.875
No.

773
00:41:32.958 --> 00:41:35.125
We're all about
to lose our minds.

774
00:41:39.125 --> 00:41:41.708
Sorry. you must be...
You must be cold.

775
00:41:45.541 --> 00:41:47.000
I'm cold-blooded.

776
00:41:48.541 --> 00:41:50.750
We're all cold-blooded.
haven't you noticed?

777
00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.666
You're not cold-blooded.

778
00:41:56.375 --> 00:41:58.000
Your family is so kind to me.

779
00:41:59.833 --> 00:42:02.125
- Sweet.

780
00:42:05.333 --> 00:42:08.083
I see why Felix
likes you so much.

781
00:42:10.333 --> 00:42:11.625
You're so. erm...

782
00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:13.375
So what?

783
00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:17.708
I don't know.

784
00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:26.041
Real.

785
00:42:27.041 --> 00:42:28.166
- Hmm.

786
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:33.500
I think I like you even more
than last year's one.

787
00:42:38.458 --> 00:42:39.625
Night.

788
00:42:46.458 --> 00:42:48.208
- What's. erm. what's...
Breakfast is ready.

789
00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:51.208
Morning.
- Morning.

790
00:42:53.041 --> 00:42:54.083
Morning.

791
00:42:54.083 --> 00:42:55.166
You sleep well. mate?

792
00:42:55.166 --> 00:42:57.125
Erm. yeah.

793
00:43:02.625 --> 00:43:03.625
Hi.

794
00:43:04.541 --> 00:43:06.125
Hey. Oliver.
have some breakfast.

795
00:43:06.125 --> 00:43:09.041
Er. can I get a full
English breakfast too. please?

796
00:43:12.166 --> 00:43:14.125
Breakfast is on the side. darling.

797
00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:15.375
Just help yourself.

798
00:43:15.875 --> 00:43:17.333
How would you like your eggs?

799
00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:19.916
- It's fine. I can get them.
Not the eggs.

800
00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:23.416
The eggs are made for you.

801
00:43:23.416 --> 00:43:24.500
Exactly.

802
00:43:25.166 --> 00:43:26.500
And everything else
is on the side.

803
00:43:33.708 --> 00:43:35.333
Fried over easy. please.

804
00:43:38.166 --> 00:43:40.291
Ollie. we were just talking
about the Shelley biography.

805
00:43:40.291 --> 00:43:42.416
Shelley who? Shelley.
Belinda's sister Shelley?

806
00:43:42.416 --> 00:43:45.166
Oh. Percy Bysshe Shelley.
The poet.

807
00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:48.250
- The Romantic poet.
- Oh.

808
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.958
Do you know the story
about Shelley's doppelgänger?

809
00:43:50.958 --> 00:43:53.250
His doppelgänger?
Mmm.

810
00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.375
Shelley's housekeeper
was cleaning one of the rooms

811
00:43:55.375 --> 00:43:58.875
when Shelley walked past
the window and waved at her.

812
00:43:59.625 --> 00:44:01.916
So. she waved back
before she realised

813
00:44:01.916 --> 00:44:03.541
that Shelley was in Italy.

814
00:44:03.541 --> 00:44:04.833
And she was on the top floor
of the house.

815
00:44:04.833 --> 00:44:07.541
Oh. Vee. Stop. stop. stop.
I won't sleep.

816
00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:09.083
A few hours later. he drowned.

817
00:44:09.625 --> 00:44:10.625
Oh!

818
00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.250
Oh. that's just
given me goosebumps.

819
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.375
- Look. Pamela.
- Oh. no.

820
00:44:15.375 --> 00:44:17.583
- I heard he fucked his sister.
- Oh. for God's sake!

821
00:44:17.583 --> 00:44:19.166
I think that was Byron.

822
00:44:19.166 --> 00:44:20.875
Oh.
speaking of which...

823
00:44:21.583 --> 00:44:25.166
Ellie. did you hear.
Ada ran off with Tommy Prior?

824
00:44:25.166 --> 00:44:26.458
Yes. you told me.
-  Thank you so much.

825
00:44:26.458 --> 00:44:28.500
'Course she did.
Her husband was ghastly.

826
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:41.541
Is everything okay. Ollie?

827
00:44:41.541 --> 00:44:44.083
Er. 'course. yeah.
It's just. erm...

828
00:44:44.875 --> 00:44:46.416
Runny eggs. I...

829
00:44:47.791 --> 00:44:49.208
I get a bit sick from them.

830
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:56.291
Sorry.

831
00:44:58.041 --> 00:44:59.083
So sorry.

832
00:44:59.083 --> 00:45:01.083
Sorry.

833
00:45:11.333 --> 00:45:12.666
We're over here. Ollie!

834
00:45:16.625 --> 00:45:18.125
Hi. mate.
Hey.

835
00:45:18.833 --> 00:45:21.041
No trunks allowed
in the field.

836
00:45:30.875 --> 00:45:32.500
Well. well. well.

837
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:35.291
- Leave him alone.

838
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.083
Good for you.

839
00:45:38.541 --> 00:45:39.958

00:47:50.083 --> 00:47:52.375
Lots of people get lost
in Saltburn.

882
00:47:54.666 --> 00:47:56.083
- Well...

883
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:23.791
All right.

884
00:49:24.625 --> 00:49:25.875
Night. mate.

885
00:50:18.208 --> 00:50:19.625
Oh. Oliver darling.

886
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:22.833
So punctual.

887
00:50:22.833 --> 00:50:25.125
Poor Vee.
The boys just run a mile.

888
00:50:25.125 --> 00:50:26.208
Why?

889
00:50:26.208 --> 00:50:27.541
Well. she gives
it away for free.

890
00:50:27.541 --> 00:50:31.500
She's sexually incontinent.
Has been since she was 14.

891
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.083
My mother always said...
"Born masochist."

892
00:50:35.083 --> 00:50:36.875
And then there's all the stuff
with the food.

893
00:50:36.875 --> 00:50:38.208
What stuff?

894
00:50:38.208 --> 00:50:39.958
You know.
"fingers for pudding".

895
00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:43.125
We thought she'd grow
out of it. the throwing up.

896
00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:45.583
I... I didn't know.

897
00:50:45.583 --> 00:50:46.958
Well. exactly!
Hasn't even helped.

898
00:50:46.958 --> 00:50:48.125
Complete waste of time.

899
00:50:48.125 --> 00:50:51.208
Honestly. But if she found
the right boy or girl.

900
00:50:51.208 --> 00:50:53.166
I don't care. Anything.

901
00:50:54.125 --> 00:50:56.125
I was a lesbian for a while.
you know.

902
00:50:56.125 --> 00:50:57.625
But it was all just
too wet for me in the end.

903
00:50:57.625 --> 00:50:59.375
Men are so lovely and dry.

904
00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:03.625
Ah. it can't have been
easy for Venetia.

905
00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:06.166
With you being her mother.

906
00:51:06.166 --> 00:51:07.958
- Why?
- Because...

907
00:51:07.958 --> 00:51:09.041
Because what?

908
00:51:09.708 --> 00:51:11.583
Because you're
so fucking beautiful.

909
00:51:24.041 --> 00:51:26.375
What do you think. er. Pamela
will be wearing tonight?

910
00:51:26.375 --> 00:51:28.791
What? Oh. Pamela's not here.

911
00:51:28.791 --> 00:51:30.625
- Oh. is she...
- She's gone.

912
00:51:30.625 --> 00:51:32.958
James thought it would better
to peel her away this morning

913
00:51:32.958 --> 00:51:35.125
without too much of a scene.

914
00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:36.875
Only so many hints
you can drop.

915
00:51:36.875 --> 00:51:38.708
Yeah. she did seem a bit lost.

916
00:51:38.708 --> 00:51:41.625
Ha. very tactful.
She's a complete limpet.

917
00:51:41.625 --> 00:51:43.083
The wettest of wet blankets.

918
00:51:43.083 --> 00:51:44.500
And very hard to know
from looking at her

919
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.958
because she's so stylish.

920
00:51:45.958 --> 00:51:47.375
You'd think she was a riot
to look at her.

921
00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:49.708
But there's absolutely nothing
going on underneath.

922
00:51:52.166 --> 00:51:53.291
I know she's
had a hideous time

923
00:51:53.291 --> 00:51:54.625
the past few years
but. honestly.

924
00:51:54.625 --> 00:51:56.125
she did go on about it.

925
00:51:58.041 --> 00:51:59.708
If all of it was true...

926
00:52:02.666 --> 00:52:03.666
What do you mean?

927
00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:08.541
I shouldn't have said that.

928
00:52:10.208 --> 00:52:11.375
No. no. go on.

929
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:16.000
No. I don't know. Just...

930
00:52:17.208 --> 00:52:20.500
Her stories. they just seemed
a bit inconsistent at times.

931
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.208
I thought you noticed it too.

932
00:52:24.208 --> 00:52:26.500
Oh. yes. I had. Absolutely.

933
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.750
The self-pity.

934
00:52:29.916 --> 00:52:31.666
the emotional blackmail.

935
00:52:33.666 --> 00:52:34.708
You know.

936
00:52:35.166 --> 00:52:36.208
Yes.

937
00:52:36.208 --> 00:52:38.500
Yes! God!

938
00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.291
I was feeling quite guilty
about it this afternoon.

939
00:52:40.291 --> 00:52:41.541
but you're absolutely right.

940
00:52:41.541 --> 00:52:44.083
There was actually something
quite sinister about her.

941
00:52:44.916 --> 00:52:45.958
Yes.

942
00:52:46.833 --> 00:52:48.333
Thank goodness
for you. Oliver.

943
00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:49.750
You're so perceptive.

944
00:53:34.791 --> 00:53:36.125
You're presumptuous.

945
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:40.541
And you're in
a see-through nightdress

946
00:53:40.541 --> 00:53:42.041
underneath my window.

947
00:53:42.916 --> 00:53:45.458
It's my house.
I can go wherever I want.

948
00:53:46.416 --> 00:53:47.875
Oh. okay.

949
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.333
And you want to be
in a see-through nightdress

950
00:53:52.333 --> 00:53:53.750
underneath my window.

951
00:53:58.041 --> 00:53:59.583
I hadn't really
thought about it.

952
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:02.583
Just a masochist. then?

953
00:54:12.458 --> 00:54:14.041
You're not eating anything.

954
00:54:17.625 --> 00:54:18.708
Yes. I am.

955
00:54:20.041 --> 00:54:21.833
Well. you're not
keeping it down.

956
00:54:24.041 --> 00:54:26.625
I mean. you're so beautiful. Venetia.

957
00:54:28.166 --> 00:54:30.000
You need to look
after yourself.

958
00:54:32.375 --> 00:54:35.791
So tomorrow
you're going to eat.

959
00:54:36.791 --> 00:54:40.125
and then you're going
to stay at the table.

960
00:54:44.833 --> 00:54:46.250
Do you understand?

961
00:54:50.458 --> 00:54:51.500
Yes.

962
00:54:52.708 --> 00:54:53.708
Good.

963
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:23.708
I could just eat you.

964
00:55:33.791 --> 00:55:35.166
Ollie...

965
00:55:35.166 --> 00:55:38.375
It's... It's not the right
time of the month.

966
00:55:38.375 --> 00:55:40.958
And is that something
you think I'm worried about?

967
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.166
It's lucky for you
I'm a vampire.

968
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.541
You've got a little
something there.

969
00:57:27.916 --> 00:57:30.416
You stupid little boy.

970
00:57:57.125 --> 00:57:58.416
It must have been
such a strain.

971
00:57:59.208 --> 00:58:00.208
I can never

972
00:58:00.208 --> 00:58:01.333
remember the name
of the. er. chubby one.

973
00:58:01.333 --> 00:58:02.416
What was it?

974
00:58:02.416 --> 00:58:03.666
He's some doctor in Paris.

975
00:58:03.666 --> 00:58:04.750
I can't remember his name.

976
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:05.958
But he gives you.
sort of. shakes

977
00:58:05.958 --> 00:58:08.375
that you mix up with water.
I suppose.

978
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.166
Good morning.
Hello. darling.

979
00:58:11.166 --> 00:58:13.541
- You sleep well?
- No. not really. mate.

980
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:15.666
We're 30 for dinner
tomorrow night.

981
00:58:15.666 --> 00:58:17.500
Stopford Sackville
has cried off.

982
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:18.583
Oh. dear. that's a shame.

983
00:58:18.583 --> 00:58:20.416
God. I forgot about
fucking dinner.

984
00:58:20.416 --> 00:58:22.333
Wait. who is coming
to dinner again?

985
00:58:22.333 --> 00:58:24.458
- The Henrys.
No. please!

986
00:58:24.458 --> 00:58:26.333
- Who are the Henrys?
Dad's friends.

987
00:58:26.875 --> 00:58:28.083
They're all called Henry.

988
00:58:28.083 --> 00:58:30.791
- Not all of them. Just most.
- It'll be fun.

989
00:58:30.791 --> 00:58:32.583
It'll be being
molested by Henry.

990
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:34.250
You know which one.

991
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:35.458
I'll put you next
to Oliver. then.

992
00:58:35.458 --> 00:58:36.916
He can molest you instead.

993
00:58:41.166 --> 00:58:42.750
Oh. Oliver.
I was going to say.

994
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.458
we should do something fun
for your birthday.

995
00:58:45.041 --> 00:58:46.083
A proper party.

996
00:58:46.541 --> 00:58:48.750
No Henrys.
Something actually fun.

997
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.833
What do you think. darling?

998
00:58:50.833 --> 00:58:53.416
If Oliver would like it.
I think it's a splendid idea.

999
00:58:53.416 --> 00:58:55.000
I think Oliver
looks like he'd rather

1000
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.458
throw himself out of a window.

1001
00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:00.416
What kind of party?

1002
00:59:00.416 --> 00:59:01.791
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

1003
00:59:01.791 --> 00:59:04.333
What do you think?
About 100 people?

1004
00:59:04.333 --> 00:59:05.583
- A hundred?
- Or two.

1005
00:59:05.583 --> 00:59:06.916
It invariably
ends up being two.

1006
00:59:06.916 --> 00:59:08.541
doesn't it. with this
sort of thing?

1007
00:59:09.083 --> 00:59:12.166
Invite whoever you want.
All your friends.

1008
00:59:12.166 --> 00:59:13.833
What friends?

1009
00:59:15.208 --> 00:59:17.916
Oh! Oh! How about fancy dress?

1010
00:59:17.916 --> 00:59:19.333
Oh. yes!

1011
00:59:19.333 --> 00:59:21.625
I can wear
my suit of armour. Elspeth.

1012
00:59:21.625 --> 00:59:22.750
Good idea. darling.

1013
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.250
We could have a theme.

1014
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:29.583
What about
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream?</i>

1015
00:59:29.583 --> 00:59:30.666
Lovely.

1016
00:59:30.666 --> 00:59:32.541
Bring on the slutty fairies.

1017
01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:04.333
Hey.

1018
01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.541
Hey.

1019
01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:14.291
Felix.

1020
01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:16.541
Is everything okay?

1021
01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:18.500
Yes. Why?

1022
01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:21.833
You seem annoyed
about something.

1023
01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:23.291
I'm not annoyed
about anything.

1024
01:00:23.291 --> 01:00:24.375
Okay.

1025
01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:29.041
It's just slightly bad form.
that's all.

1026
01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:31.125
- What's bad form?
- What do you think?

1027
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.375
Getting with Venetia. Ollie.

1028
01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:37.000
What makes you think
I got with Venetia?

1029
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.500
Farleigh saw you two.

1030
01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.791
It's just
fucking cringe. mate.

1031
01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:41.041
I mean. really.
you're my friend.

1032
01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:42.208
You're supposed
to be here with me.

1033
01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:44.208
Look. I didn't want
to embarrass Venetia.

1034
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:46.791
What do you mean?

1035
01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:49.916
Well. I saw her...
I saw her outside

1036
01:00:49.916 --> 01:00:51.666
and I went down to see
was she okay.

1037
01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:55.458
And I think she got the wrong
end of the stick because...

1038
01:00:55.458 --> 01:00:57.166
she tried to kiss me.

1039
01:00:57.166 --> 01:00:59.000
And I politely
steered her away.

1040
01:00:59.916 --> 01:01:02.208
Farleigh said you two were
practically eating each other.

1041
01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:03.666
Oh. and you believe him?

1042
01:01:04.333 --> 01:01:05.916
Me and Venetia?

1043
01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:07.416
Come on.

1044
01:01:13.958 --> 01:01:15.875
- Well. why didn't you tell me?
- I just...

1045
01:01:16.875 --> 01:01:18.416
I thought it would
be nicer not to.

1046
01:01:19.166 --> 01:01:21.375
She was hammered.
Probably doesn't remember.

1047
01:01:23.958 --> 01:01:25.500
She's so embarrassing.

1048
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.500
And fucking Farleigh.
What a little a shit stirrer.

1049
01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:29.416
Mmm.

1050
01:01:29.416 --> 01:01:31.250
Well. someone
has to entertain us all.

1051
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:32.416
Right.

1052
01:01:34.666 --> 01:01:36.041
That's why we love him.

1053
01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:40.916
Thank God.

1054
01:01:40.916 --> 01:01:43.041
You know. I thought we had
another Eddie situation.

1055
01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:45.291
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

1056
01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:46.833
Eddie was my best friend
at school.

1057
01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.083
And he came to stay with us.

1058
01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:50.333
And he. kind of.

1059
01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.583
developed a little thing
for Venetia.

1060
01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:56.166
and everything just
got so awkward.

1061
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.125
Yeah. it. kind of.
ruined our friendship.

1062
01:02:05.458 --> 01:02:06.541
I can imagine.

1063
01:02:40.208 --> 01:02:41.500
I'm not saying
my mother isn't

1064
01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:42.916
completely idiotic
when it comes to money.

1065
01:02:42.916 --> 01:02:44.166
You just have
to be firm with her.

1066
01:02:44.166 --> 01:02:46.000
I can't call her
and tell her no.

1067
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.708
I know. I know.
You've said that.

1068
01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:49.250
- I know. I understand.
No. you don't.

1069
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.958
- You don't. It's humiliating.
It's very hard...

1070
01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:52.625
I'm sorry.
but it's a bit fucking shitty.

1071
01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:54.500
You're all throwing Oliver
a party for 200 people

1072
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.125
while my mother
lives in squalor.

1073
01:02:56.125 --> 01:02:57.875
Oh. she's hardly
living in squalor. mate.

1074
01:02:57.875 --> 01:02:59.875
Well. she can't
pay her bills. so she will be.

1075
01:02:59.875 --> 01:03:01.958
Okay? At the rate she's going.
she will be.

1076
01:03:01.958 --> 01:03:03.250
Right.
that's exactly why

1077
01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:04.625
Dad's concerned
about helping her.

1078
01:03:04.625 --> 01:03:05.875
He doesn't wanna enable her.

1079
01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:07.708
He wants her to learn
to stand on her own two feet.

1080
01:03:07.708 --> 01:03:09.416
- Yeah. like he does?
- Farleigh.

1081
01:03:09.416 --> 01:03:12.375
I mean. you do know
how this looks. right?

1082
01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:16.458
Making me come to you
with a begging bowl.

1083
01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:17.666
What are you implying?

1084
01:03:17.666 --> 01:03:19.791
I think you know
what I'm implying. Felix.

1085
01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:23.250
Why don't you ask
Liam and Joshua?

1086
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:24.375
Who...

1087
01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:26.000
Who the fuck
are Liam and Joshua?

1088
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.083
Your footmen.

1089
01:03:33.916 --> 01:03:36.291
Oh. that is...

1090
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:38.666
That is low. Farleigh.

1091
01:03:38.666 --> 01:03:39.875
- Jesus Christ. mate.
- Okay.

1092
01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:41.333
Seriously. is that...
Is that where

1093
01:03:41.333 --> 01:03:42.750
- you wanna take this?
- Right.

1094
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:43.958
Make it a race thing?

1095
01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:47.250
What the fuck?
I mean. we're your family.

1096
01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:49.166
We hardly even notice
that you're different.

1097
01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:50.250
or anything like that.

1098
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.500
Mmm.
- I never know

1099
01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.958
our footmen's names.

1100
01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:54.791
The turnover of a footman
is notoriously high.

1101
01:03:54.791 --> 01:03:56.583
- Of course.
- And by the way.

1102
01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:58.041
my father has been
more generous

1103
01:03:58.041 --> 01:03:59.416
than most people would be.

1104
01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:01.375
A lot more.

1105
01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:08.083
But...

1106
01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:12.500
maybe... maybe we've done
all that we can.

1107
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:41.416
How do you know
her father. then?

1108
01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:46.041
Felix warned you off. then?

1109
01:04:49.583 --> 01:04:52.166
Well. maybe we just need to be
a bit more careful.

1110
01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:55.125
No. thanks.

1111
01:04:57.833 --> 01:05:00.500
It's just so disappointing.

1112
01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:03.291
You're just another
one of his toys.

1113
01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:07.833
You're upset.

1114
01:05:07.833 --> 01:05:10.375
Oh. don't worry.
I'm used to it. Honestly.

1115
01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.250
I mean. he never liked
sharing his toys.

1116
01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.291
Even the ones he doesn't want
to play with any more.

1117
01:05:21.166 --> 01:05:23.250
Henry. how is your
gorgeous son?

1118
01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:27.750
Venetia. Venetia...

1119
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:30.291
- Me first. You're on my left.
- I'm sorry.

1120
01:05:30.291 --> 01:05:31.375
Of course.

1121
01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:34.958
So. how long have you
known the Cattons for?

1122
01:05:34.958 --> 01:05:37.375
Oh. forever. Forever and ever.

1123
01:05:37.375 --> 01:05:40.583
- And how... how did you...
- My husband is James' godson.

1124
01:05:40.583 --> 01:05:41.750
How long have
you been married?

1125
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:42.875
You've been married long?

1126
01:05:42.875 --> 01:05:44.208
Yes.

1127
01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:46.416
- Lovely.
- Why?

1128
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:49.750
- Erm...
- Why would it be "lovely"?

1129
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:51.583
- Hmm?
- The man's an idiot.

1130
01:05:51.583 --> 01:05:52.791
...from the ocean floor.

1131
01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:54.291
Do you know what I mean?

1132
01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:57.583
- Have you got children?
- Yes. Two.

1133
01:05:57.583 --> 01:06:00.041
No. three. Three boys.

1134
01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:02.041
- Must be a handful.
- Well. no. they're at school.

1135
01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:03.166
That's the main thing
about school.

1136
01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:04.375
you hardly ever have
to see them.

1137
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.041
Hen. darling. save me.

1138
01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:10.750
The rumour was.
she had two arseholes.

1139
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:13.083

she was a bloody hooker?

I think I'd fuck Richard III.

01:07:06.083 --> 01:07:09.125
He's so insecure. so you know
he'd put in the work. right?

1161
01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:15.291
Or you could just fuck me?

1162
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:25.250

about me and Venetia?

1163
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.791
Well. I didn't think
he'd react that badly.

1164
01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:29.375
Yes. you did.

1165
01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:30.916
Yes. I did.

1167
01:07:36.833 --> 01:07:38.500
if you ever wanna
talk to anyone.

1168
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.375
you can talk to me. Farleigh.

1169
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:44.750
What do you mean?

1170
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:47.708
Well. I know you're going
through a hard time at home.

1171
01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:50.041
I know how that feels.

1172
01:07:52.208 --> 01:07:54.000
When things are so precarious.

1173
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.083
It's terrifying.

1174
01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:01.291
And lonely.

1175
01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:04.333
And it must be
so fucking weird

1176
01:08:04.333 --> 01:08:06.250
having to ask them
for everything.

1177
01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:08.625
And I know
you fucking hate me.

1178
01:08:08.625 --> 01:08:09.708
I...

1179
01:08:10.416 --> 01:08:11.500
I don't hate you.

But if you ever wanted me

1181
01:08:13.291 --> 01:08:15.166

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:19.833
If I can help in any way...

1183
01:08:21.125 --> 01:08:22.125
...just ask.

1184
01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:31.375
- Okay.

1185
01:08:32.166 --> 01:08:34.875

01:11:28.583 --> 01:11:29.875
No.

1228
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.750
Don't make me ask again.

1229
01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:48.500
Say it.

1230
01:11:52.416 --> 01:11:53.750
I'm going to behave.

1231
01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:00.541
- What the fuck...

1232
01:12:46.208 --> 01:12:47.750
I wouldn't do this.
James is very upset.

1233
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:49.375
You know that...
Why would I do this?

1234
01:12:49.375 --> 01:12:50.541
I don't know...
I swear to God.

1235
01:12:50.541 --> 01:12:52.083
- this has to be...
Enough!

1236
01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:53.291
There must be
some kind of mistake here.

1237
01:12:53.291 --> 01:12:54.375
Farleigh...
- I'm sure I can...

1238
01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:55.833
Vee. what the fuck
is going on?

1239
01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:57.833
It's Farleigh.

1240
01:12:58.875 --> 01:12:59.875
What happened?

1241
01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.458
He tried to nick something.

1242
01:13:01.458 --> 01:13:02.833
What are you talking about?

1243
01:13:05.041 --> 01:13:06.791
He's a fucking idiot.

1244
01:13:06.791 --> 01:13:07.875
Move!
Please.

1245
01:13:11.583 --> 01:13:12.708
Fuck.

1246
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:18.833
<i>♪ Because you're gorgeous ♪</i>

1247
01:13:18.833 --> 01:13:21.458
I mean. it's outrageous!

1248
01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:22.833
What
actually happened?

1249
01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:24.375
He sent an email
to Sotheby's

1250
01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:25.666
to say that he'd "come by"

1251
01:13:25.666 --> 01:13:27.333
- some Palissy plates.

1252
01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:28.708
I mean. the idiot.
He had to have known

1253
01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:30.291
that Dad went to school
with the chairman.

1254
01:13:30.291 --> 01:13:32.875
I mean.
talk about biting the hand.

1255
01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:35.291
And Mum and Dad would give him
anything he asked for.

1256
01:13:35.291 --> 01:13:38.416
Yeah. well. obviously
he got sick of asking.

1257
01:13:38.416 --> 01:13:41.166
That's ridiculous.
He's more spoilt than we are.

1258
01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:43.333
I mean. come on. Vee. You...
You have to admit.

1259
01:13:43.333 --> 01:13:44.666
It's a little bit dark.
him having to go

1260
01:13:44.666 --> 01:13:46.291
to Mum and Dad
with a begging bowl.

1261
01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:48.083
- Oh. boo-fucking-hoo.
All right. yes.

1262
01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:49.958
Fine. it was incredibly
fucking stupid...

1263
01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:51.041
Guys. guys. guys.

1264
01:13:53.041 --> 01:13:54.291
Oliver.
don't mention it. okay?

1265
01:13:54.291 --> 01:13:56.041
What happens
if they bring him up?

1266
01:13:56.541 --> 01:13:58.958
- They won't.
- What a glorious day.

1267
01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:01.416
Never known a summer
as hot as this one.

1268
01:14:01.416 --> 01:14:02.500
Sweltering.

1269
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:04.291
I think it's even hotter
than last year.

1270
01:14:04.291 --> 01:14:05.416
I didn't think
that was possible.

1271
01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:07.333
but here we are again.

1272
01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:10.291
It's hotter than Barbados.
apparently. Barbados!

1273
01:14:10.291 --> 01:14:11.416
No. I can
believe it. darling.

1274
01:14:11.416 --> 01:14:13.875
Honestly. I don't think I've
ever been hotter in my life.

1275
01:14:13.875 --> 01:14:15.166
Oh.
I need to check with Robert...

1276
01:14:15.166 --> 01:14:16.291
- ...to make sure that

1277
01:14:16.291 --> 01:14:17.375
he's being extra vigilant
with the hydrangeas.

1278
01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:18.500
Very wise. my love.

1279
01:14:20.166 --> 01:14:21.416
Oh. bliss.

1280
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.291
Bliss. bliss. bliss.

1281
01:14:24.708 --> 01:14:25.833
Mmm!

1282
01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:29.583
Oh. this song. God. I haven't
heard this song in forever.

1283
01:14:31.125 --> 01:14:33.250
I used to hang out
with them all. actually.

1284
01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.208
when I was modelling.
Britpop. Blur. Oasis.

1285
01:14:36.208 --> 01:14:38.958
God. the parties.
Oh. but then. of course.

1286
01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:40.250
<i>Common People</i> came out

1287
01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:42.000
and everybody thought
it was written about me.

1288
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.625
Which was completely
mortifying and ridiculous.

1289
01:14:44.625 --> 01:14:46.458
I mean. I barely knew Jarvis.

1290
01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:48.750
What?
She came from Greece.

1291
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:49.958
She had a thirst
for knowledge.

1292
01:14:49.958 --> 01:14:51.041
It couldn't have been me.

1293
01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:52.583
I've never wanted
to know anything.

1294
01:14:54.291 --> 01:14:57.375
God. I wish we didn't
have to go to London.

1295
01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:58.875
I didn't know you were
going to London.

1296
01:14:58.875 --> 01:15:00.083
Pamela's funeral.

1297
01:15:00.083 --> 01:15:02.416
-  Oh.
- Pamela died?

1298
01:15:02.416 --> 01:15:03.583
Yeah.

1299
01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:05.333
She'd do anything
for attention.

1300
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:38.000
Morning. birthday boy.

1301
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.250
Get dressed.
We're going on a road trip.

1302
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:44.750
Where?

1303
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:46.833
Oh. it's a surprise.

1304
01:16:46.833 --> 01:16:47.916
Wear something nice.

1305
01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:24.041
How much further is it?

1306
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.250
It's not too far now.

1307
01:17:38.791 --> 01:17:41.291
Er. please tell me you're...

1308
01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:43.208
Felix. are...

1309
01:17:43.208 --> 01:17:44.958
Look. Ollie.
just hear me out. all right?

1310
01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:46.166
No. no. no.
- Hear me out for a sec.

1311
01:17:46.166 --> 01:17:47.333
What have you done?
What have you done?

1312
01:17:47.333 --> 01:17:49.375
- Your mum called a week ago.
- Er...

1313
01:17:49.375 --> 01:17:50.708
You left your phone
in the bathroom.

1314
01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:52.000
so I thought. I thought...

1315
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.500
I. sort of. just picked up.

1316
01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.875
I mean. you've been ignoring
her calls for weeks

1317
01:17:54.875 --> 01:17:57.041
and I just thought that
maybe I could help.

1318
01:17:57.041 --> 01:18:00.375
And on the phone. she really
sounded sober. mate.

1319
01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.833
She had no idea where you were
and she just wanted

1320
01:18:02.833 --> 01:18:04.250
to send you a card
for your birthday.

1321
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:06.333
Please turn the car round.
You can't take me there.

1322
01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:08.041
You can't. Felix. you can't
take me there.

1323
01:18:08.041 --> 01:18:09.166
- Ollie. she's your mother.
- No!

1324
01:18:09.166 --> 01:18:10.791
She's your family!

1325
01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:12.375
- She's all that you've got.
- You don't understand!

1326
01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:13.500
- Ollie. she's your...
- You don't!

1327
01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.583
- I'm begging you.
- Mate...

1328
01:18:14.583 --> 01:18:16.041
I'm begging you. Please. no.

1329
01:18:16.041 --> 01:18:18.000
I'm not taking "no" for
an answer. mate. I'm sorry.

1330
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.500
You have to fix this. mate.

1331
01:18:28.666 --> 01:18:31.333
Oh. look. there's a sign.
Churchill Avenue. Right.

1332
01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:32.541
Oh. 138.

1333
01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:34.375
Is this it?

1334
01:18:36.333 --> 01:18:38.250
- Oh. this is nice. mate.

1335
01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:40.291
Look. she's clearly
cleaned up her act.

1336
01:18:40.791 --> 01:18:41.833
This is lovely.

1337
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:45.750
Let's do this.

1338
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:49.291
Let me go in
without you. please.

1339
01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:50.500
I'm not leaving you. mate.

1340
01:18:51.166 --> 01:18:52.166
We're in this together.

1341
01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:35.250
Oliver! Oh!

1342
01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:37.375
Praise you're alive.

1343
01:19:38.958 --> 01:19:40.166
I didn't recognise you.

1344
01:19:43.125 --> 01:19:44.375
Happy birthday. darling.

1345
01:19:47.166 --> 01:19:49.958
You must be Felix.
It's so nice to meet you.

1346
01:19:49.958 --> 01:19:51.166
Your father's in the garden.

1347
01:19:51.166 --> 01:19:53.083
- His father?
Yeah.

1348
01:19:53.541 --> 01:19:55.916
He's been pacing around
all morning. He's so excited.

1349
01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:57.541
Come in. Come in.

1350
01:19:58.208 --> 01:19:59.208
Jeff!

1351
01:20:05.041 --> 01:20:06.833
Oh. that was in Mykonos.

1352
01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:08.208
We go every year.

1353
01:20:08.208 --> 01:20:09.333
Well. not any more.

1354
01:20:09.333 --> 01:20:11.583
No. not now
the kids are all grown up.

1355
01:20:11.583 --> 01:20:12.666
Kids?

1356
01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:14.875
You told me you were
an only child. Oliver?

1357
01:20:14.875 --> 01:20:17.541
No. I've always talked about
my sisters.

1358
01:20:21.958 --> 01:20:23.083
All right.

1359
01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:24.166
Well. I must have...

1360
01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:25.916
I must have forgotten.

1361
01:20:25.916 --> 01:20:27.666
I'm not surprised
if he didn't.

1362
01:20:27.666 --> 01:20:29.500
He always wanted
to be an only child.

1363
01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.166
always beetling off
by himself.

1364
01:20:31.166 --> 01:20:33.333
I bet. yeah. Yeah. I bet.

1365
01:20:33.333 --> 01:20:35.541
They didn't know what to do
with him at his school.

1366
01:20:35.541 --> 01:20:36.875
He was so clever.

1367
01:20:36.875 --> 01:20:38.291
That's why I think

1368
01:20:38.291 --> 01:20:39.958
he found it hard
to make friends.

1369
01:20:39.958 --> 01:20:41.291
The others were jealous.

1370
01:20:43.416 --> 01:20:47.000
And now he's the top scholar
at Oxford.

1371
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.416
- The top scholar?

1372
01:20:50.333 --> 01:20:51.416
God. he's so modest.

1373
01:20:51.416 --> 01:20:53.666
You know. I... I had no idea.

1374
01:20:53.666 --> 01:20:55.208
It's been hard not seeing him.

1375
01:20:55.208 --> 01:20:57.666
Yeah. but it must be a lot
of pressure. though. I expect.

1376
01:20:57.666 --> 01:20:58.750
Oh. yeah.

1377
01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:00.291
- Yeah. of course it is.
- I bet. Yeah. I can't imagine.

1378
01:21:00.291 --> 01:21:01.375
Working day and night.

1379
01:21:01.375 --> 01:21:03.750
And then. on top of it all.
he's got the union.

1380
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:05.208
- The plays.

1381
01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.291
- Yeah. the plays.
The rowing team.

1382
01:21:06.291 --> 01:21:07.416
- The rowing team?
Oh. yeah...

1383
01:21:07.416 --> 01:21:09.250
I've gotta go.
What d'you mean?

1384
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:11.708
I've got these
horrible migraines.

1385
01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:14.416
Oh. Why don't you lie down
upstairs. darling?

1386
01:21:14.416 --> 01:21:15.833
I made your bed up
in case you wanted to stay.

1387
01:21:15.833 --> 01:21:16.916
We've got to get back.
We've...

1388
01:21:16.916 --> 01:21:18.625
We've got to get back
for my party.

1389
01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:19.708
Oliver...
Oliver. your mother spent

1390
01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:20.875
- all morning making lunch.
It doesn't matter.

1391
01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.875
- It does matter. It does.
No. it's all right.

1392
01:21:22.875 --> 01:21:24.541
- If he's not well...
It's not okay.

1393
01:21:24.541 --> 01:21:25.916
It doesn't matter.
it's only spag bol.

1394
01:21:25.916 --> 01:21:27.166
And the cake?

1395
01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:29.041
It doesn't matter.

1396
01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:31.166
Of course we can stay.
we would love to stay.

1397
01:21:31.833 --> 01:21:32.916
Ollie. just take a pill
or something.

1398
01:21:32.916 --> 01:21:34.125
for Christ's sake.

1399
01:21:42.708 --> 01:21:44.125
I love spag bol.

1400
01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:53.791
Felix. look. Felix.

1401
01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:55.125
please. let me just explain.

1402
01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:56.333
I think the best thing

1403
01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:58.166
is that you go home
after your party.

1404
01:21:58.166 --> 01:21:59.583
It's too late
to cancel it now.

1405
01:21:59.583 --> 01:22:01.041
and summer's almost finished anyway.

1406
01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:04.041
So I think we'll have
your party tonight. and...

1407
01:22:05.666 --> 01:22:07.375
I will see you back at Oxford.

1408
01:22:07.375 --> 01:22:08.833
And we can still be friends. though?

1409
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:11.500
I mean. we're going
to laugh about this.

1410
01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:13.416
I... I...

1411
01:22:14.583 --> 01:22:15.750
I don't even know
why I said it.

1412
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.125
It's just a stupid thing
to say...

1413
01:22:17.125 --> 01:22:18.625
No. it's fucking weird.
is what it is. mate.

1414
01:22:18.625 --> 01:22:20.083
Honestly. I don't
even know where to start.

1415
01:22:20.083 --> 01:22:22.291
I mean.
you're a fucking liar. Ollie.

1416
01:22:27.833 --> 01:22:28.916
Why would you lie?

1417
01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:35.458
I just wanted
to be your friend.

1418
01:22:44.166 --> 01:22:46.541
Look. let's just
get through tonight.

1419
01:22:46.541 --> 01:22:48.000
Can you not tell your family. please?

1420
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.625
Of course not. Fucking hell!

1421
01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:51.125
It's dark enough as it is!

1422
01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.208
Duncan.

1423
01:23:26.208 --> 01:23:27.500

Have you seen Felix?

1446
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:13.750
Nope.

1447
01:24:17.791 --> 01:24:18.958
Which one's
the biggest...

1448
01:24:18.958 --> 01:24:20.125
Oh. no.

1449
01:24:20.125 --> 01:24:22.083
- Oh. fuck.
Felix.

1450
01:24:22.833 --> 01:24:24.666
Can I. er. talk to you
for one second?

1451
01:24:27.541 --> 01:24:29.416
You can't ignore me forever.

1452
01:24:29.416 --> 01:24:30.583
I can try.

1453
01:24:30.583 --> 01:24:32.375
Felix.
we need to talk.

1454
01:24:32.375 --> 01:24:33.583
Felix. come on!

1455
01:24:33.583 --> 01:24:34.666
Look. man. I tried to be nice.

1456
01:24:34.666 --> 01:24:36.250
but can you fuck off
and bother somebody else?

1457
01:24:44.083 --> 01:24:45.333
Who was that?

1458
01:25:18.666 --> 01:25:19.958
Hello. Farleigh.

1459
01:25:19.958 --> 01:25:22.083
How did you know it was me?

1460
01:25:22.666 --> 01:25:23.666
Signet ring.

1461
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:26.750
God.

1462
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:28.666
You really do notice
everything. don't you?

1463
01:25:30.791 --> 01:25:31.916
Have they seen you yet?

1464
01:25:32.541 --> 01:25:33.833
Not yet.

1465
01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:37.833
Yeah. they'll go ballistic.

1466
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:39.750
I doubt it.

1467
01:25:40.416 --> 01:25:41.875
They invited me.

1468
01:25:44.041 --> 01:25:45.291
Ohhh!
Mmm.

1469
01:25:46.666 --> 01:25:47.708
Mmm.

1470
01:25:50.541 --> 01:25:52.208
God. the look on your face.

1471
01:25:52.208 --> 01:25:54.083
They can't have invited you.

1472
01:25:54.083 --> 01:25:56.500
Oh. Oliver.
you'll never catch on.

1473
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:59.041
This place...

1474
01:25:59.875 --> 01:26:01.625
You know.
it's not for you.

1475
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:05.166
It is a fucking dream.

1476
01:26:05.166 --> 01:26:07.166
It is an anecdote
you'll bore your fat kids

1477
01:26:07.166 --> 01:26:08.375
with at Christmas.

1478
01:26:09.166 --> 01:26:11.791
Oliver's once in a lifetime

1479
01:26:11.791 --> 01:26:15.291
handjob on a hay bale.
golden. big boy summer!

1480
01:26:17.875 --> 01:26:19.250
You'll cling on to it.

1481
01:26:19.833 --> 01:26:21.875
and comb over it.
and jerk off to it.

1482
01:26:21.875 --> 01:26:24.166
and you'll wonder how
you could ever

1483
01:26:24.833 --> 01:26:27.791
ever. ever. ever get it back.

1484
01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:29.958
But you don't get it back.

1485
01:26:32.541 --> 01:26:34.166
Because your summer's over.

1486
01:26:36.208 --> 01:26:37.333
And so you...

1487
01:26:37.333 --> 01:26:39.291
Oh...

1488
01:26:39.291 --> 01:26:40.416
You...

1489
01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:42.416
catch a train...

1490
01:26:44.291 --> 01:26:46.416
to whatever
creepy doll factory

1491
01:26:46.416 --> 01:26:48.458
it is they make Olivers in.

1492
01:26:48.458 --> 01:26:51.666
And I come back here.

1493
01:26:54.916 --> 01:26:56.250
This isn't a dream to me.

1494
01:26:58.041 --> 01:26:59.083
It's my house.

1495
01:27:01.291 --> 01:27:04.958
So whatever happens.
I always come back.

1496
01:27:08.416 --> 01:27:10.000

1520

No. I wasn't.

1522

You know.

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:18.375
- No. we need to talk.
- Please stop.

1528
01:30:18.375 --> 01:30:20.166
We can't... We can't.
are you fucking crazy?

1529
01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:22.208
- You can't just throw me away.
- Get the fuck away from me.

Ah. fuck...

1531
01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:27.000

So I'm sorry that...

1535
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.291
my performance
wasn't good enough.

1536
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I think...

1537
01:30:43.916 --> 01:30:45.333
I think you need
to see somebody.

1538
01:30:45.333 --> 01:30:46.583
You need help. okay?
Seriously.

1539
01:30:46.583 --> 01:30:47.875
No. No. I don't.

1540
01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:50.625
I just need you to understand
how much I fucking love you.

1541
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:53.916
You're the only friend
I ever had. Felix.

I mean. doesn't this
just prove how much.

1544
01:30:59.916 --> 01:31:01.708
how much of a good friend
I actually am?

1545
01:31:02.708 --> 01:31:04.041
How well I actually know you?

1546
01:31:04.916 --> 01:31:06.333
I'm still the same person.

1547
01:31:07.916 --> 01:31:10.083
Yeah?
I'm still the same person.

1548
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:14.083
I don't know what you are.

1549
01:31:18.291 --> 01:31:19.458
But I do know you.

1550
01:31:20.166 --> 01:31:22.666
you make my fucking blood
run cold.

1551
01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:41.291
Wait there a sec.

1552
01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:46.166
Fuck. Ah.

1553
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:05.291
- Better?
- Fuck you.

1554
01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.833
I think
you should go to bed.

1555
01:32:13.375 --> 01:32:15.166
I don't care
what you think any more.

1556
01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:28.833
Oh. fuck.

1557
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:39.000
Felix!

1558
01:33:41.041 --> 01:33:42.583
Felix!
Felix!

1559
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.125

1561
01:34:18.125 --> 01:34:19.250

1562
01:34:24.875 --> 01:34:27.750
<i>You're just turning the handle
on a jack in the box.</i>

1563
01:34:30.208 --> 01:34:32.583
<i>Walking towards
the end of the world.</i>

1564
01:34:50.125 --> 01:34:51.916
<i>Knowing that any second...</i>

1565
01:34:58.166 --> 01:35:00.166
<i>the ground
was gonna fall away.</i>

1566
01:35:19.666 --> 01:35:20.958
It's the end of everything.

1567
01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:12.291
Darling. darling boy.

1568
01:36:14.166 --> 01:36:15.666
- My darling boy.

1569
01:36:18.375 --> 01:36:19.875
Help me move him.

1570
01:36:19.875 --> 01:36:21.208
We need to get him inside.

1571
01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:22.291
Get him warm.

1572
01:36:26.708 --> 01:36:28.250
I just need
to get him warmed up.

1573
01:36:30.291 --> 01:36:31.458
Felix. darling.

1574
01:36:32.291 --> 01:36:33.750
where's your jumper?

1575
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:34.958
Hmm?

1576
01:36:34.958 --> 01:36:36.125
Where's your jumper?

1577
01:36:39.875 --> 01:36:41.625
Come on now! Help me.

1578
01:36:43.375 --> 01:36:44.791
I don't think
we can move him. James.

1579
01:36:44.791 --> 01:36:47.208
I think... I think the police.

1580
01:36:47.208 --> 01:36:48.291
Yes.

1581
01:36:49.166 --> 01:36:50.375
Yes. come away. darling.

1582
01:36:52.333 --> 01:36:53.333
It's nearly lunch.

1583
01:36:53.875 --> 01:36:54.875
Yes.

1584
01:37:26.166 --> 01:37:27.166
What is it. Duncan?

1585
01:37:27.166 --> 01:37:29.166
It's the police.
Your Ladyship.

1586
01:37:30.541 --> 01:37:31.708
They're having trouble.

1587
01:37:33.208 --> 01:37:34.458
What kind of trouble?

1588
01:37:34.458 --> 01:37:36.500
They keep getting lost
in the maze.

1589
01:37:38.125 --> 01:37:39.125
And?

1590
01:37:40.583 --> 01:37:42.083
May I send
one of the gardeners

1591
01:37:42.083 --> 01:37:43.291
- to assist them. sir?
- Fine.

1592
01:37:47.458 --> 01:37:48.541
Oliver. darling.

1593
01:37:48.541 --> 01:37:50.250
Why don't you tell us
about last night?

1594
01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:53.583
- Last night?
Mmm.

1595
01:37:53.583 --> 01:37:55.041
Did you have a lovely time?

1596
01:37:55.833 --> 01:37:57.583
Yeah. it was. er. wonderful.

1597
01:37:58.166 --> 01:37:59.416
- Thank you.
Oh. good.

1598
01:37:59.416 --> 01:38:01.125
I think it was a hit.
Don't you. darling?

1599
01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:02.500
Oh. yes. a triumph.

1600
01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.208
Yes. The house
looked good. didn't it?

1601
01:38:04.208 --> 01:38:06.541
Beautiful.
- And that cake was...

1602
01:38:06.541 --> 01:38:07.958
Oh. did you like it?

1603
01:38:07.958 --> 01:38:09.666
- Mm-hmm.
- I never had any in the end.

1604
01:38:09.666 --> 01:38:10.958
That's always the way.
isn't it?

1605
01:38:10.958 --> 01:38:12.208
You end up running around
so much

1606
01:38:12.208 --> 01:38:13.500
you miss the actual party.

1607
01:38:16.708 --> 01:38:17.791
What now?

1608
01:38:18.916 --> 01:38:21.416
May I be permitted
to close the curtains. sir?

1609
01:38:22.458 --> 01:38:24.291
Sir. the coroner's outside

1610
01:38:24.291 --> 01:38:26.125
and may need
to pass the window with...

1611
01:38:26.125 --> 01:38:27.750
Yes. thank you. Close them.

1612
01:38:29.166 --> 01:38:31.458
I don't normally
like chocolate cake.

1613
01:38:31.458 --> 01:38:33.500
Yes. it can be cloying.
can't it?

1614
01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.750
Mmm. but last night
it was so light.

1615
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:38.416
Yes. Lynn has always
been an expert with cakes.

1616
01:38:38.416 --> 01:38:40.208
Yes. cold hands. apparently.

1617
01:38:40.208 --> 01:38:41.541
You have to have cold hands.

1618
01:38:41.541 --> 01:38:43.750
Mm-hmm. I've heard.

1619
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:45.583
So the butter doesn't melt.

1620
01:38:45.583 --> 01:38:47.250
Although
I would think

1621
01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:48.750
that applied more
to pastry than to...

1622
01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:51.708
Duncan. just get them closed.
for Christ's sake!

1623
01:38:51.708 --> 01:38:54.125
Yes. I am trying. sir.
I can't.

1624
01:38:57.458 --> 01:38:58.625
- I'm so sorry.

1625
01:38:59.958 --> 01:39:01.041
I'm so sorry.

1626
01:39:29.333 --> 01:39:31.333
Oh. my God.

1627
01:39:32.416 --> 01:39:34.916
Er. may I be excused. please?

1628
01:39:34.916 --> 01:39:36.541
No. we haven't finished lunch.

1629
01:39:36.541 --> 01:39:38.541
Lunch is cold.

1630
01:39:39.125 --> 01:39:41.250
You want me just to eat it
like nothing's happening?

1631
01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:42.875
What else is there to do. darling?

1632
01:39:42.875 --> 01:39:45.541
- Anything! Anything!
-  Farleigh!

1633
01:39:45.541 --> 01:39:46.875
Will you be quiet?

1634
01:39:46.875 --> 01:39:48.708
Sit down
and eat the bloody pie!

1635
01:39:48.708 --> 01:39:49.958
Just eat it!

1636
01:39:49.958 --> 01:39:51.958
Eat it and shut up!

1637
01:39:51.958 --> 01:39:53.500
Eat the bloody pie!

1638
01:39:56.458 --> 01:39:58.625
You're not the only person
here with feelings.

1639
01:40:00.375 --> 01:40:02.916
None of us wants
your bloody American feelings.

1640
01:40:02.916 --> 01:40:04.458
I think it's delicious.

1641
01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.541
What the fuck
are you still doing here?

1642
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:16.625
Wait. does no one else
find it weird?

1643
01:40:18.416 --> 01:40:19.791
No one else finds that weird?

1644
01:40:19.791 --> 01:40:21.666
I wouldn't throw stones
if I was you. Farleigh.

1645
01:40:21.666 --> 01:40:23.416
Excuse me?
- Please stop.

1646
01:40:23.416 --> 01:40:25.458
What is he saying?
- I... I have no idea.

1647
01:40:25.458 --> 01:40:27.833
What I'm saying
is I would feel guilty too.

1648
01:40:27.833 --> 01:40:29.375
- Guilty?
If I was the one

1649
01:40:29.375 --> 01:40:31.666
racking up lines
the night someone died.

1650
01:40:33.875 --> 01:40:36.708
- Fuck you.
- That's not a denial.

1651
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:38.916
Is that true?

1652
01:40:41.291 --> 01:40:42.291
Search Farleigh's room.

1653
01:40:42.291 --> 01:40:43.458
- Yes. sir.
- No.

1654
01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:47.250
Get out!

1655
01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:49.041
-  No. wait...

1656
01:40:49.041 --> 01:40:50.708
- Erm...
- What's happening?

1657
01:40:50.708 --> 01:40:52.500
Aunt Elspeth... Elspeth...

1658
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.125
Don't you dare look at her!

1659
01:40:54.833 --> 01:40:55.833
Get out!

1660
01:40:58.166 --> 01:40:59.791
I won't mention this
to the police.

1661
01:41:00.666 --> 01:41:01.916
That's all you'll get.

1662
01:41:01.916 --> 01:41:03.000
Nothing more.

1663
01:41:03.625 --> 01:41:04.666

1698
01:45:50.916 --> 01:45:53.875
Yes.
so much nicer than his father.

1699
01:45:53.875 --> 01:45:55.333
Oh. he was all right.

1700
01:45:55.333 --> 01:45:56.708
Just a little old fashioned.

1701
01:45:56.708 --> 01:45:58.375
Extremely old fashioned.

1702
01:45:58.916 --> 01:46:00.333
Do you remember
Felix's christening?

1703
01:46:00.333 --> 01:46:01.833
- Mm-hmm.
-"You can't possibly

1704
01:46:01.833 --> 01:46:03.583
"have River as a middle name."
Do you remember?

1705
01:46:03.583 --> 01:46:06.333
Hm.  I remember
you giving him what for.

1706
01:46:08.250 --> 01:46:09.458
It doesn't matter now.

1707
01:46:10.458 --> 01:46:12.833
It doesn't matter
what his middle name is now.

1708
01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:14.583
- Darling.
He was right.

1709
01:46:14.583 --> 01:46:16.625
River is quite silly.

1710
01:46:16.625 --> 01:46:19.416
But I suppose you don't pick
your child's name

1711
01:46:19.416 --> 01:46:21.833
imagining that one day
you'll have to think about

1712
01:46:21.833 --> 01:46:23.541
how it will look...

1713
01:46:26.916 --> 01:46:28.000
carved on a...

1714
01:46:29.083 --> 01:46:31.500
headstone.
Choose a font.

1715
01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:32.875
What font did you choose?

1716
01:46:35.166 --> 01:46:36.333
Times New Roman.

1717
01:46:38.875 --> 01:46:40.083
On local stone.

1718
01:46:40.625 --> 01:46:42.250
- It'll be good. I think.
- Yeah. yeah.

1719
01:46:43.041 --> 01:46:45.125
It's a good choice. Solid.

1720
01:46:47.208 --> 01:46:48.250
I'll leave you.

1721
01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:50.750
You're not going anywhere.
Oliver. darling?

1722
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:52.125
I was just going upstairs.

1723
01:46:52.125 --> 01:46:53.541
But you're not leaving us?

1724
01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:56.750
You're not leaving Saltburn?

1725
01:47:08.541 --> 01:47:09.916
Ah. sorry.

1726
01:47:10.833 --> 01:47:14.916
Your politeness is so grating.

1727
01:47:14.916 --> 01:47:18.708
- Do you know that?
- Erm. sorry?

1728
01:47:18.708 --> 01:47:20.166
You're always sorry.

1729
01:47:21.416 --> 01:47:25.958
Always flinching away
like a little fucking...

1730
01:47:27.583 --> 01:47:28.708
serf.

1731
01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:37.250
I saw you.

1732
01:47:39.833 --> 01:47:42.083
Sobbing in the church
at the funeral.

1733
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:45.833
I watched you weeping away
and I just...

1734
01:47:47.583 --> 01:47:49.416
I felt so sorry for you.

1735
01:47:51.375 --> 01:47:52.416
So sorry.

1736
01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:56.875
And then I remembered...

1737
01:48:00.958 --> 01:48:03.666
and I started laughing.

1738
01:48:11.375 --> 01:48:12.458
I just...

1739
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:16.125
I just couldn't stop laughing

1740
01:48:16.125 --> 01:48:19.125
because I...
I remembered that...

1741
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:24.041
that you only knew him for...

1742
01:48:26.125 --> 01:48:28.041
six months?

1743
01:48:30.166 --> 01:48:31.958
You hardly knew him. Ollie.

1744
01:48:32.791 --> 01:48:35.291
You have nothing to do

1745
01:48:35.291 --> 01:48:38.708
with him. with us.

1746
01:48:39.416 --> 01:48:40.500
with here.

1747
01:48:41.583 --> 01:48:43.125
Nothing at all.

1748
01:48:44.958 --> 01:48:47.041
You're just a stranger.

1749
01:48:48.583 --> 01:48:51.916
- It's very late.
- Yet. here you are.

1750
01:48:52.916 --> 01:48:54.708
Right in the middle of it all.

1751
01:48:55.333 --> 01:48:56.333
Ooh.

1752
01:48:58.083 --> 01:49:01.500
Stranger fucking danger.

1753
01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.541
- Yeah. I'm going to bed.

1754
01:49:04.375 --> 01:49:05.708
Ollie. you know...

1755
01:49:06.583 --> 01:49:08.333
You know what
Daddy's starting to call you?

1756
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:11.041
Spiderman.

1757
01:49:12.541 --> 01:49:14.333
- Really?
- Because you're always

1758
01:49:14.333 --> 01:49:16.458
just skulking around.

1759
01:49:17.416 --> 01:49:24.000
Weaving your spider-y.
Oliver-y web.

1760
01:49:25.166 --> 01:49:26.875
Good night.
Drink some water...

1761
01:49:26.875 --> 01:49:30.000
Hey. Ollie. Ollie.
don't be upset.

1762
01:49:32.541 --> 01:49:34.083
I don't think you're a spider.

1763
01:49:37.166 --> 01:49:39.875
I think you're a moth.

1764
01:49:42.375 --> 01:49:43.958
I'm right. aren't I?

1765
01:49:46.041 --> 01:49:47.458
Quiet...

1766
01:49:49.083 --> 01:49:50.333
harmless...

1767
01:49:51.083 --> 01:49:53.458
drawn to shiny things...

1768
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.541
batting up against
the window...

1769
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:06.083
just desperate to get in.

1770
01:50:09.583 --> 01:50:10.958
Well. you've done it now.

1771
01:50:16.833 --> 01:50:19.500
You've made your holes

1772
01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:21.791
in everything.

1773
01:50:25.041 --> 01:50:27.250
You'll eat us
from the inside out.

1774
01:50:27.250 --> 01:50:29.250
- You've drunk way too much.
- Yeah.

1775
01:50:29.250 --> 01:50:30.375
Hm.

1776
01:50:33.375 --> 01:50:34.916
Isn't that his aftershave?

1777
01:50:34.916 --> 01:50:36.125
Hm?

1778
01:50:38.625 --> 01:50:43.166
You are a fucking freak.

1779
01:50:43.666 --> 01:50:46.458
I bet you're wearing
his underwear too. aren't you?

1780
01:50:46.458 --> 01:50:47.541
Yeah.

1781
01:50:47.541 --> 01:50:51.166
You disgusting little nobody.

1782
01:50:51.166 --> 01:50:52.541
Oh. my God!

1783
01:50:52.541 --> 01:50:54.583
You ate him right up

1784
01:50:54.583 --> 01:50:58.000
and you licked
the fucking plate!

1785
01:51:37.916 --> 01:51:39.333
It broke her completely.

1786
01:51:42.208 --> 01:51:43.458
She said it herself.

1787
01:51:44.833 --> 01:51:46.458
She couldn't live without him.

1788
01:52:17.125 --> 01:52:18.625
Thank you
for coming to see me.

1789
01:52:24.125 --> 01:52:25.750
Is everything all right?

1790
01:52:27.041 --> 01:52:28.041
Er...

1791
01:52:33.791 --> 01:52:35.916
How long were you planning
on staying with us?

1792
01:52:35.916 --> 01:52:37.375
Because Elspeth
won't let you go.

1793
01:52:38.458 --> 01:52:40.625
Erm. I'm happy to stay

1794
01:52:40.625 --> 01:52:43.125
- as long as she needs me to.
- Very kind of you.

1795
01:52:43.125 --> 01:52:46.166
But I'm not sure
that's good for her or us.

1796
01:52:47.416 --> 01:52:48.583
I think it's time. Oliver.

1797
01:52:48.583 --> 01:52:51.333
for you to go home
discreetly tonight.

1798
01:52:52.208 --> 01:52:53.541
to cause her
the least anxiety.

1799
01:52:53.541 --> 01:52:54.791
I hope you understand.

1800
01:52:54.791 --> 01:52:56.833
I'd go in a heartbeat
if I could.

1801
01:52:58.250 --> 01:53:01.750
I just don't think
I can leave her in this state.

1802
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:02.833
Well...

1803
01:53:03.375 --> 01:53:05.958
It would be best if the family
was able to grieve in private.

1804
01:53:05.958 --> 01:53:07.833
Oh. I...
I understand. I agree.

1805
01:53:07.833 --> 01:53:08.916
I agree.

1806
01:53:10.375 --> 01:53:12.333
But I just think
it's best if I stay

1807
01:53:12.333 --> 01:53:13.625
just for the time being.

1808
01:53:14.833 --> 01:53:17.000
I want to do
what's right for her.

1809
01:53:21.416 --> 01:53:22.416
You won't go?

1810
01:53:22.416 --> 01:53:24.000
I don't see how I can.

1811
01:53:35.833 --> 01:53:36.833
What are you doing?

1812
01:53:38.916 --> 01:53:40.916
- How much?
- Excuse me?

1813
01:53:40.916 --> 01:53:42.458
How much for you to leave
and never come back?

1814
01:53:42.458 --> 01:53:44.333
To cease all contact
with my wife?

1815
01:53:44.333 --> 01:53:45.458
- Why?
- Because we all

1816
01:53:45.458 --> 01:53:46.583
have to move on.

1817
01:53:47.875 --> 01:53:49.750
- I know you live under

1818
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:51.541
somewhat
difficult circumstances.

1819
01:53:51.541 --> 01:53:53.750
but this will be a fresh start
for you too.

1820
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:55.541
Why are you doing this?

1821
01:53:56.458 --> 01:53:58.208
How much?

1822
01:54:03.208 --> 01:54:04.500
How much?

1823
01:54:05.916 --> 01:54:06.916
How much?

1824
01:55:19.625 --> 01:55:21.250
Thanks.

1825
01:55:39.083 --> 01:55:40.083
Oliver.

1826
01:55:42.125 --> 01:55:43.583
- Oliver.
- Elspeth.

1827
01:55:44.416 --> 01:55:47.666
- My God.
- Oh. Ollie!

1828
01:55:48.583 --> 01:55:50.250
Oh. how handsome you look!

1829
01:55:50.250 --> 01:55:51.583
I can't believe it.

1830
01:55:52.791 --> 01:55:54.541
But you're all grown up.
you're...

1831
01:55:54.541 --> 01:55:56.041
Of course. you're grown up.

1832
01:55:56.041 --> 01:55:58.166
Of course. silly of me.
of course.

1833
01:55:59.375 --> 01:56:00.500
You grew up.

1834
01:56:01.916 --> 01:56:03.500
- Sorry.

1835
01:56:04.166 --> 01:56:05.500
I'm all over the place
at the moment.

1836
01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:08.291
I... I read the news
about Sir James.

1837
01:56:09.250 --> 01:56:10.791
I'm so dreadfully sorry.

1838
01:56:14.083 --> 01:56:16.500
I was surprised
he waited so long in a way.

1839
01:56:17.541 --> 01:56:18.541
You know...

1840
01:56:20.833 --> 01:56:23.000
But still it was a...
a terrible shock.

1841
01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.083
Yeah.

1842
01:56:25.833 --> 01:56:27.166
It's so funny to see you.

1843
01:56:28.875 --> 01:56:31.208
I've actually just bought
a little flat nearby.

1844
01:56:31.208 --> 01:56:32.583
Oh. what are the odds?

1845
01:56:32.583 --> 01:56:35.208
Saltburn suddenly seemed
so big and so far away.

1846
01:56:35.208 --> 01:56:37.833
How is Saltburn?
Er. is Duncan still there?

1847
01:56:37.833 --> 01:56:39.000
Oh. God. he's still there.

1848
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.125
Oh. everything's the same.

1849
01:56:40.125 --> 01:56:42.250
Exactly. exactly the same
as when you left it.

1850
01:56:43.041 --> 01:56:45.416
I'm glad.

1851
01:56:45.416 --> 01:56:48.583
Ollie. I didn't like it
the way James treated you.

1852
01:56:49.708 --> 01:56:51.166
and I wanted to say something.

1853
01:56:51.666 --> 01:56:53.125
Oh. it was a long time ago.

1854
01:56:53.125 --> 01:56:54.583
No. but it's not to me.

1855
01:56:54.583 --> 01:56:56.625
You see.
I've thought about it a lot.

1856
01:56:57.333 --> 01:56:58.333
And...

1857
01:56:59.750 --> 01:57:00.750
you have to remember

1858
01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:02.291
that he wasn't
in his right mind then.

1859
01:57:02.291 --> 01:57:03.625
after everything
that happened.

1860
01:57:04.583 --> 01:57:05.583
And he...

1861
01:57:07.125 --> 01:57:09.250
You do forgive him.
you do understand?

1862
01:57:11.166 --> 01:57:12.166
Of course.

1863
01:57:18.375 --> 01:57:19.541
Have you been happy?

1864
01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:24.541
Not really.

1865
01:57:26.208 --> 01:57:27.208
You?

1866
01:57:29.166 --> 01:57:30.416
Not really.

1867
01:57:32.958 --> 01:57:33.958
Flat white.

1868
01:57:46.666 --> 01:57:47.833
Come up and stay.

1869
01:57:48.708 --> 01:57:49.750
At Saltburn.

1870
01:57:51.375 --> 01:57:53.000
Coast is clear now. isn't it?

1871
01:58:04.458 --> 01:58:06.708
I can honestly say
that these last few months

1872
01:58:06.708 --> 01:58:08.666
have been the happiest
of my life.

1873
01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.250
It's just such a shame
you got so ill.

1874
01:58:32.041 --> 01:58:34.000
But it's been a privilege
to look after you.

1875
01:58:36.208 --> 01:58:39.083
<i>Just as it'll be a privilege
to look after Saltburn.</i>

1876
01:58:41.416 --> 01:58:44.500
<i>So thank you for trusting me.</i>

1877
01:58:47.416 --> 01:58:49.416
<i>I promise
I'll look after this house</i>

1878
01:58:49.416 --> 01:58:50.791
<i>just as Felix would have.</i>

1879
01:58:55.166 --> 01:58:57.000
We got there in the end.
didn't we?

1880
01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.208
Somehow.

1881
01:58:59.541 --> 01:59:00.583
Thank God.

1882
01:59:01.375 --> 01:59:04.708
After all those terrible.
terrible accidents.

1883
01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:10.125
But...

1884
01:59:11.791 --> 01:59:13.416
is there really
ever such a thing

1885
01:59:13.416 --> 01:59:15.041
as an accident. Elspeth?

1886
01:59:17.583 --> 01:59:19.208
- I don't know.

1887
01:59:21.208 --> 01:59:23.083
Accidents are for people
like you.

1888
01:59:23.625 --> 01:59:25.791
For the rest of us.
there's work.

1889
01:59:26.458 --> 01:59:27.666
And unlike you.

1890
01:59:28.416 --> 01:59:30.000
I actually know how to work.

1891
01:59:42.125 --> 01:59:44.125
Please. I...
I don't have any money.

1892
01:59:45.875 --> 01:59:47.416
Could I just pay you tomorrow?

1893
01:59:48.791 --> 01:59:50.333
<i>What actually happened?</i>

1894
01:59:50.333 --> 01:59:51.958
<i>He sent an email
to Sotheby's</i>

1895
01:59:51.958 --> 01:59:54.583
<i>to say that he'd "come by"
some Palissy plates.</i>

1896
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:58.875
<i>I've actually just
bought a little flat nearby.</i>

1897
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Oliver.

1898
02:00:09.041 --> 02:00:10.666
I wasn't "in love" with him.

1899
02:00:12.083 --> 02:00:14.125
I know.
everyone thought I was.

1900
02:00:14.125 --> 02:00:15.208
But I wasn't.

1901
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:17.916
<i>I loved him.</i>

1902
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.500
<i>I loved him.</i>

1903
02:00:23.916 --> 02:00:26.791
<i>I loved him.
By God. I loved him.</i>

1904
02:00:28.458 --> 02:00:29.541
<i>But sometimes...</i>

1905
02:00:30.583 --> 02:00:31.583
I...

1906
02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:34.166
I hated him.

1907
02:00:55.125 --> 02:00:56.625
- I hated him.

1908
02:00:59.750 --> 02:01:01.458
Yeah. I hated him.

1909
02:01:14.875 --> 02:01:16.416
I hated all of you.

1910
02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.791
And you made it so easy.

1911
02:01:24.416 --> 02:01:26.958
