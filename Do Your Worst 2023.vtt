3
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.960
Over the years.
we have explored the life

4
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.720
of every creature
of the African grassland.

5
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.080
We have worked hard to unlock
the mysteries of their world.

6
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.400
But there has always been
one being beyond our study.

7
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.160
Until now.

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
She is an anomaly on the Savanna.

9
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.200
neither hunter nor gatherer.

10
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.320
She is a scavenger
living off the spoils of others.

11
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.720
What drives her.

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.880
motivates her?

13
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.160
-What are the s--
-Cut!

14
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.560
That was lovely. You were wonderful.

15
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.960
-What the f--
-She is…

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.680
…a hot mess.

17
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.000
Johannesburg. her habitat.

18
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.240
An imperfect city. unlovable.
yet beautiful in its own way.

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.960
Despite the absence
of any social contribution.

20
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.800
she and her pack
roam the highveld together.

21
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.040
But theirs is an uneasy alliance.

22
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.240
Hey!

23
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.800
What are you tryna do? Kill someone?

24
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.840
-Go fuck yourself.
-Really? Well. go fuck yourself as well.

25
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.280
Excuse me.

26
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.280
I will fucking kick you
in your tiny bitch ass balls.

27
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.600
Now. let's begin our tale…

28
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.200
…of the urban jungle.

29
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.320
Dick.

30
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.400
Cunt.

31
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.320
-Do you wanna run your lines again?
-I'm good.

32
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.840
Who're you texting?

33
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.440
-No one.
-Dish.

34
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.560
-Diego.
-That fuck boy!

35
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.160
Come on. Son. I dunno why you bother.

36
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.640
What?

37
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.480
-Nothing.
-Bullshit.

38
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.320
He just sent me a dick pic.

39
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.080
-Ah let's see!
-You are driving!

40
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.520
Fine!

41
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.480
But at least give me a description.

42
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.720
I mean. are we talking.
"The Rock and two tractor tyres" or

43
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.960
"Danny DeVito and a couple of grapes."

44
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.640
Carla. we can't do
this anymore. there's like…

45
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.800
a right to privacy.

46
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.720
Come on. Sondra. that's not fair.
I'm a married woman.

47
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.560
This is the closest
I've been to a penis in years.

48
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.680
-Please.
-No.

49
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.720
-Please.
-Stop it. No.

50
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.120
It's my penis.

51
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.080
Okay. You ready?

52
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.040
Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.040
Gum.

54
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.960
Look at me.

55
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.840
You got this.

56
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.000
Say it after me. I got this.

57
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.560
-I got this.
-Sondra de Silva.

58
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.200
-this one is gonna be different.
-It's gonna be different.

59
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.680
Okay. Don't worry about the bloating.

60
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.480
-What bloating?
-You got this. Break a leg.

61
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.360
Profile left. please.

62
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.720
And right.

63
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.760
Face front.

64
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.120
Hands. please.

65
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.400
Other side.

66
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.920
All right. thank you.

67
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.200
Is that not Marlene from Daylight Destiny?

68
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.840
What. that soapy from
like 20 years ago?

69
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.680
Hi. I'm Sondra de Silva and I'll be
auditioning for Serenity Anti-age Cream.

70
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.480
Is she not a little old?

71
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.000
Um…

72
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.720
my agent said the brief was for
women between 35 and 40 with dark hair.

73
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.520
Right. Okay.

74
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.760
Sure.

75
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.880
Um. Sondra do you need a script?

76
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.280
-No. I'm good.
-Okay.

77
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.720
Well then. if you can get
into your bikini now. please--

78
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.240
Bikini? I'm sorry. My agent never
mentioned anything about a bikini.

79
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.960
My darling. just do it in your bra. Okay?

80
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.920
-Sorry.
-All right. ladies. So you're on a beach.

81
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.640
You're a group of friends
and you're playing volleyball.

82
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.520
-Okay?
-And what else?

83
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.520
Nothing. That's it. Okay?

84
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.680
And action.

85
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.160
I'm sorry. Hang on. Wait. Stop. Sorry.

86
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.600
Are we meant to be miming here?

87
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.880
Yes. you are miming the volleyball.

88
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.120
-Just mime.
-Okay. thank you.

89
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.640
Guys. guys. guys.

90
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.840
There can only be one ball.

91
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.200
So like. let me start.

92
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.560
We can… Okay?

93
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.240
Um. but what was wrong with
the way that we were doing it?

94
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.360
Nothing.

95
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.600
So you basically just want us
to jump up and down? Yeah?

96
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.520
‎

97
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.720
Mommy.

98
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.280
What do you mean. you're outside?

99
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.240
No. Mommy. I've told you.
you can't keep coming around like this.

100
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.560
It's called boundaries.

101
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.720
Like all of it?

102
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.480
It seems that way.

103
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.840
You spent your entire pension.

104
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.520
How's that even possible?

105
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.880
We trusted your Uncle Joe
to manage everything for us.

106
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.560
How were we to know
we were paying for his penthouse in Ibiza?

107
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.520
-Ibiza.
-No. Mommy he should be in jail.

108
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.320
He will pay for it in the afterlife.

109
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.040
-Don't you worry.
-What about in this life?

110
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.920
Don't get all high
and mighty about stealing.

111
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.560
Didn't you steal
your sister's boyfriend in high school?

112
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.960
-I have apologized for--
-Look. enough.

113
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.800
You'll be out at the end of the month.
I'm going to Airbnb the house.

114
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.960
What?!

115
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.360
-Dad!
-Technically speaking.

116
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.560
we bought it.

117
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.080
But you bought Raquel a house. too.

118
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.400
She has a husband and a child.

119
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.000
Plus she paid us back.

120
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.560
Think of it as a good opportunity.

121
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.400
-For what?
-To get your life together.

122
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.280
There's nothing wrong with my life.
My ship is about to come in.

123
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.200
There are no ships for actresses over 40.

124
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.640
Where am I supposed to live?

125
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.120
Get yourself a job.
Better still. get married.

126
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.640
I'm working on it.

127
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.600
Yes. with another drug addict. no doubt.

128
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.520
All I know is we are not paying
for you anymore. Sondra.

129
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.600
It's time to get realistic.

130
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.680
Get a real job. Rent a place and stop--

131
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.000
‎

132
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.560
Makalah. please do not hit your brother.

133
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.120
Okay. violence is not the answer.

134
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.320
I will buy you a new one. honey. Okay?

135
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.400
But that was a limited edition one I--

136
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.440
Okay well…

137
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.360
Okay. okay.

138
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.560
Precious!

139
00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.440
Precious. please can you come and help me?

140
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.120
First I have to remodel
the bathroom. though.

141
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.880
Okay. Then what are you gonna do after?

142
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.360
I don't know. Move in with Diego. I guess.

143
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.960
Son. we've been besties since
you made Hannah cry

144
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.600
on the first day of drama school.

145
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.520
We've been through it all.

146
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.920
You are my ride-or-die.
I will always have your back.

147
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.400
Thanks. buddy.

148
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.400
Diego is never going to marry you.

149
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.200
What?

150
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.320
Hot toy boys don't marry cougars
unless the cougars are rich.

151
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.000
You should just get back together
with that restaurant owner.

152
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.640
-You mean the drug addict?
-He's rich.

153
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.320
What part of drug addict
don't you understand?

154
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.080
So marry him. divorce him.
get some alimony.

155
00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.679
Just because I'm over 35
doesn't mean I can't have--

156
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.360
So you have ruled out
anyone who is divorced.

157
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.360
has kids. has an addiction problem.

158
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.400
has a small dick. is depressed.
wears sondals. Who is left?

159
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.640
Why are you so obsessed
with me getting married?

160
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.720
Because what else are you gonna do?

161
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.240
At some point. you need to accept the idea

162
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.440
that you're probably
not gonna be famous again.

163
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.040
I take you to every audition.

164
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.640
When was the last time
you had a proper one?

165
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.640
-My ears are burning.
-Can't we just share Jerry?

166
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.200
You guys talking about me again?

167
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.600
Mm.

168
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.680
You can have him.

169
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.480
-She doesn't know what she's talking--
-Jerry's the greatest.

170
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.040
And you are not my best friend anymore.

171
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.200
Hey. what happened to
"you are my ride-or-die"?

172
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.320
Besides. I have to say that

173
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.240
Jerry lends me money all the time
and I never pay him back.

174
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.360
Oh. forget about it.

175
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.800
You're a worthwhile investment. Sondra.

176
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.880
Thank you. Jerry.

177
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.200
Okay. whatever.

178
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.360
Enjoy your booty call.

179
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.560
You know. maybe he actually likes me.

180
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.760
I'm just being honest.

181
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.440
Something about this guy
doesn't feel right.

182
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.840
You're still a star. Sondra.

183
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.920
Do you really think so?

184
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.040
When I was a kid I used
to dream about being with you.

185
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.040
Mm-hmm.

186
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.160
Marlene from Daylight Destiny.

187
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.760
Thick dark hair.

188
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.920
Dark eyes.

189
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.680
Phew. Killer tits.

190
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.080
You're such a flirt.

191
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.000
Babe when I… when I was 14.
I had your poster on my wall.

192
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.960
Mm!

193
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.400
Do you wanna um…?

194
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.680
Do you wanna come to
my birthday party tomorrow?

195
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.680
It's dinner.

196
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.760
Sure thing. babe.

197
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.520
Happy birthday. my soul.

198
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.360
Oh. thank you. my life.

199
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.280
-And?
-And…

200
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.440
Oh my God. Car. he's the one.

201
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.760
I swear. I swear to you.
there was something…

202
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.240
I don't know.
There's just something about that

203
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.160
little pep talk you gave me
about husbands. it just…

204
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.440
I don't know. It was like the cosmic key I
needed to unlock my destiny or something.

205
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.160
Okay. that's amazing.
But get to the good part.

206
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.240
Length. Girth.
I want all the gory details.

207
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.440
Okay. First. we'll count

208
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.200
Chris Hemsworth
astride two massive boulders.

209
00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.520
More. I need more.

210
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.240
Uh-huh.

211
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.880
Ah!

212
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.640
Ah!

213
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.560
-Doesn't she look amazing?
-Shut up. Jerry.

214
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.920
You may now kiss the bride.

215
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:24.840
‎

216
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.520
Ah!

217
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.440
Oy! Hey! Whoo! What? Ooh!
What's happening down there?

218
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.680
Oh. hey. Mm.

219
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.040
Ooh!

220
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.800
I always wanted to do that.

221
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.200
It's so sexy.

222
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.760
So intimate. so risqué.

223
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.520
You what?!

224
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.640
Ah. Jerry would never do that to me.

225
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.040
So? Not everyone needs a licked arsehole.

226
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.440
Ah. you're always on his side.
You're just like my mother.

227
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.480
I'm on your side.

228
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.160
When we fell in love.
he was like a normal guy.

229
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.560
We hung out in Melville. We had opinions.

230
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.160
Meritocracy is the light of the soul.

231
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.080
There's no such thing
as merit in the society.

232
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.040
It's either you're part
of the haves or the have-nots.

233
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.120
And we are divided into
those categories by the elitist.

234
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.120
white capitalists who control our lives.

235
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.640
Amandla.

236
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.400
Now he's like Jewer than Jew.

237
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.800
I swear if there was a competition
for the best Jew in Jo'burg.

238
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.280
Jerry would win like.
first. second and third place.

239
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.840
I don't know what
you're moaning about. Jerry loves you.

240
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.080
I just didn't think
he'd take it so seriously.

241
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.080
Car. you did tell him
he had to convert to marry you?

242
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.080
I didn't mean he actually had to find God.

243
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.400
If you want Jerry
to lick your arsehole. just ask him.

244
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.760
Oh. he has like zero interest
in having sex with me.

245
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.760
-Carla.
-Jerry.

246
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.400
Do you even wanna have sex?

247
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.760
I'm into it.

248
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.160
No.

249
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.000
Where are you going?

250
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.760
I don't know.

251
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.960
To watch porn.

252
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.000
Pray.

253
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.920
I haven't decided!

254
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.680
I guess it's just me
and Pastor Enoch tonight.

255
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.640
Yeah. You need to stop cheating
on Jerry with your Christian dildo.

256
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.280
It doesn't mind if I eat bacon.

257
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.320
I gotta go. I'm gonna go and kerfuffle
with my future husband some more.

258
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.880
Send photo.

259
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.440
Okay. I told you. privacy!

260
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.560
Diego.

261
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.680
I'm coming.

262
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.520
Sondra? Mmm.

263
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.520
I'm Grant from Grants Construction.
We're here to do your bathroom.

264
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.120
-Mm.
-Do you know your gate's open?

265
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.040
Fuck.

266
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.400
It's the first door on the right.

267
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.000
This way.

268
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.920
You're Marlene from Daylight Destiny?

269
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.040
-In the flesh.
-Don't tell anyone. but I love that show.

270
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.120
And you're the worst.
you know. in the best way.

271
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.360
Thank you.

272
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.480
-You still acting?
-Yeah.

273
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.520
All the time.

274
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.680
Wow.

275
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.600
Well. it's…

276
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.600
-Hey.
-Ah. hey.

277
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.840
Hi.

278
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.120
Mmm.

279
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.560
I can still taste you.

280
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.400
All right. I'm out of here.

281
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.800
Oh. you don't wanna get…

282
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.360
-You don't wanna get breakfast?
-No.

283
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.600
Got to hit the gym. babe.

284
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.560
Okay.

285
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.080
Okay. I'll see you at six then.
Time machine.

286
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.080
And don't forget
the birthday dinner at 7:30.

287
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.440
Yeah. Okay.

288
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.320
Um… see you later.

289
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.400
See you later.

290
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.560
Good evening. May I grab this chair?

291
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.480
Um. I'm… I'm waiting on someone.

292
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.480
Sorry.

293
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.080
There you go.

294
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.200
Thank you so much.

295
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.960
Hmm.

296
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.200
-Babe?
-Mm-hmm?

297
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.680
Don't you think we should eat?

298
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.400
We have to wait
for the birthday girl.

299
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.640
I mean. honey. it's a model.

300
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.440
-Mm.
-Raquel?

301
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.040
-Hmm?
-Do you own the salon or…

302
00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.359
-Well--
-She should.

303
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.200
Yes. right?

304
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.240
No. I wish. I just manage it.

305
00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.359
Oh. that's exciting.

306
00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:25.800
How do you two know my sister?

307
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.960
Mm-mmh.

308
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.120
We don't actually.
Um. both Car's and I's kids

309
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.440
go to Clever Club together and…

310
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.520
And mine. yeah.

311
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.040
We both met sneaking a cigarette.

312
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.000
Carla. Smoking again?

313
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.720
Yeah. You know what?

314
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.200
Let's eat. I'm starving.

315
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.360
-Yes can we eat?
-I'm starving.

316
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440
Thank goodness. Yes.

317
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.920
Oh. finally.

318
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.520
-The birthday girl is here.
-Oh?

319
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.840
Oh.

320
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.120
-Happy birthday.
-Yeah!

321
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.360
-Hello Jerry.
-Hello.

322
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.400
The birthday girl.

323
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.280
The birthday girl's here.

324
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.120
Hello you two.

325
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.240
Holy shit.

326
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.760
Oh my gosh.

327
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.200
-Happy birthday!
-You're…

328
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.320
Aren't you…

329
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.360
You're that…

330
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.760
‎-I used to love you.
‎-I used to love to hate you.

331
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.680
Sondra and Carla went
to drama school together.

332
00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.000
Yeah. I was actually
shortlisted for the role.

333
00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.680
but my bestie hijacked my audition. so…

334
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.360
It's not my fault
they saw me in reception.

335
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.040
Funny how you knew my lines though.

336
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.280
I did help her rehearse.

337
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.520
The rest is history.

338
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.040
Sondra became famous
and Carla married me.

339
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.440
-Who are these people?
-Uh. Son?

340
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.960
-Where's Diego?
-Who's Diego?

341
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.800
Wine?

342
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.200
So. Noms and I
are playing Cliff. Shag. Marry

343
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.120
and there's this… this rugby coach.

344
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.480
And…

345
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.520
She says. "I'd fuck him."

346
00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:00.720
I mean. I could not think of anything
worse than being single at our age.

347
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.040
-No. it can never be me.
-Like nothing!

348
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.640
Never. ever.

349
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.800
I'm so sorry. Son.

350
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.640
It's really not that bad.

351
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.320
It's like. you know…

352
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.040
-It's like test-driving a car.
-What?!

353
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.120
-What?!
-She means sex.

354
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.400
Oh!

355
00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.440
You have my… anyway guys.

356
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.440
do you have some stories that
you can share with us married folks?

357
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.680
Yes!

358
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.320
-Yes.
-I don't kiss and tell.

359
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.360
-She does. and you do.
-Ah. I knew it!

360
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.360
Sondra has had more
one-night stands than moustache waxes.

361
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.160
She has got stories for days.

362
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.960
But of course. but of course.
she wants to marry them all.

363
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.280
Okay. okay. What is your worst story?

364
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.720
How much time do you have?

365
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.080
You know I think the thing that
I hate the most is the. is the dick pics.

366
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.360
I've never gotten one.

367
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.320
You know what.
I'm gonna tell you something.

368
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.240
Guys. we don't like them.

369
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.960
Do you by any chance
have any on your phone?

370
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.520
Yes!

371
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.280
I delete them.

372
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.400
She's lying.

373
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.720
She keeps the best ones
for when we need a laugh.

374
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.560
Oh come on. show them.

375
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.360
Show us. show us. show us. show us!

376
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.960
Show them. show them. show them!

377
00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.560
Okay.

378
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.160
-I'm so excited.
-I have to go first

379
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.440
because the only dick
I've ever seen is my husband's.

380
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.320
Oh no!

381
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.640
This one we call Tom Cruise
and a couple of grapes.

382
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.880
-Oh no!
-Oh my God.

383
00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.680
No. you gotta… Just watch. Look!

384
00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.880
I mean this…

385
00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.160
Ooh.

386
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.880
What? I mean. it is so short.

387
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.960
Yes.

388
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.920
Yet confident.

389
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.520
Is it confident? Or is it--

390
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.840
No. no. no!

391
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.120
The dick pics…
The dick pics are only the beginning.

392
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.160
Ah no. this one time
Sondra was screwing this guy. okay.

393
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.840
and she opens the door and his father…

394
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.800
-No!
-…who lives with him. is listening in.

395
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.600
No! That is so…

396
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.640
He put a chair there and everything.

397
00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:54.000
This other time this guy wanted
all three of his dogs on the bed

398
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.760
-when they're going…
-The dogs?Awww!

399
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.760
And just yesterday.

400
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.800
this guy. this guy Diego
is going down on her

401
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.080
and he sorta just.
he licks out her arsehole.

402
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.840
Don't you dare try that with me.

403
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.080
But now…

404
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.680
But now of course
he won't return her calls.

405
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.400
I mean. fuck.

406
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.880
It's fucking…

407
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.520
Fuck off. Carla.

408
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.080
It's Jerry.

409
00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.760
I'm so sorry. Son.

410
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.320
She can be…

411
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.480
She can be really awful sometimes.

412
00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.200
I think she's jealous of you.

413
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.080
No. she's not.

414
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.360
And I don't know how you put up with her.

415
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.840
I ask myself the same question.

416
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.440
I don't know.

417
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.160
Maybe you and I should just… leave.

418
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.480
Oh shut up. Jerry.

419
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.320
Anyway. probably should have remembered to

420
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.880
swap out the wine
for the non-alcoholic again.

421
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.680
-Chin up. Jerry.
-She didn't forgive me for an entire week.

422
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.000
Shut up. Jerry.

423
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.520
I love you.

424
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.880
No.

425
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.080
No. no.

426
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.600
No. look out.

427
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.120
Careful. I'm so hungover.

428
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.880
Please hold still.
Otherwise. you'll lose a lip.

429
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.520
Why didn't I
cancel this appointment?

430
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.000
Sorry.

431
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.000
It's probably my agent.

432
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.800
Just spam.

433
00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.280
-Just spam?
-They're relentless.

434
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.840
For God’s sake. Sondra.
just answer the phone.

435
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.200
No. Raquel!

436
00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.720
Why do you keep hanging up on Jerry?

437
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.320
Don't you want to pull off the other side?

438
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400
I know what I'm doing.

439
00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.480
But why do you keep hanging up on Jerry?

440
00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.360
Sondra. if you don't tell me.
I'm gonna answer the phone.

441
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.320
I'm answering the phone.

442
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.200
Fine. Okay. okay.

443
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.560
He kissed me last night in the bathroom
after Carla was so awful to me.

444
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.560
He did what?

445
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.840
-That is a lot of wax.
-No. that is an appropriate amount of wax.

446
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.880
-It was an accident.
-Okay.

447
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.400
Listen. Carla was
a piece of crap last night.

448
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.600
But that does not give you
the right to jump her husband.

449
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.720
-It was an accident.
-An accident? An accident?

450
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.360
Just like my Renaldo
in Standard Eight. was that an accident?

451
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.120
Oh my God. We were teenagers.

452
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.600
-What are you doing?
-I'm doing my job!

453
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.440
No. Ow. ow.

454
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.880
Where are you going?

455
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.840
I'm not going to let
my little sister disfigure me.

456
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.280
Thanks for
the sisterly support by the way.

457
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.360
You're welcome.

458
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.840
Yeah. Good luck with that.

459
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.480
Fuck. Fuck.

460
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.520
-Grant?
-Oh. gents.

461
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.880
I'm so sorry. um I need to
use the bathroom. please.

462
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.240
-Sorry?
-You know.

463
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.600
can you guys leave for the day?

464
00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.760
We're on a really tight deadline here.

465
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.480
Can't you please use the portaloo outside?

466
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.640
It's a fucking
medical emergency. Grant!

467
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.120
Gents. take five.

468
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.760
Just grab a…

469
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.280
Fuck!

470
00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.680
Fuck!

471
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.760
-Are you okay?
-No. I'm not fucking okay.

472
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.640
Do you need an ambulance?

473
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.880
No. I don't need
a fucking ambulance!

474
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.240
Is she okay?

475
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.800
I hope she doesn't need any--

476
00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.440
Fuck. fuck!

477
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.400
Sondra?

478
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.760
-I'm coming in.
-No. no. no. no. no.

479
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.560
-I'm not looking. I'm in.
-No.

480
00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.680
I'm in.

481
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.560
-What's going on in here?
-Nothing. I'm fine.

482
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.240
Okay.

483
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.160
-Do you need a doctor?
-No.

484
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.640
So what do you need?

485
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.280
It's an epilation malfunction.

486
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.400
A what?

487
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.000
A very. very bad wax.

488
00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.840
Oh.

489
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.320
Okay. Um…

490
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.640
-Let me see it.
-No.

491
00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.200
Look I doubt it's anything I haven't seen.
I grew up with four sisters.

492
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.360
Okay. look.

493
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.360
Can you go and you go
do it somewhere else?

494
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.840
Oh boy.

495
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.800
-Oh fuck!
-Mmm.

496
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160
Um…

497
00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.400
We're gonna need olive oil.

498
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.120
Hmm? To um…

499
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.320
Where. now?

500
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.560
Here we go.

501
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.800
Okay.

502
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.000
Okay. The lips are apart now.

503
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.000
Thank you. Grant. You can go.

504
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.720
Oh!

505
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.080
You sure you’re okay?

506
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.560
Mm-hmm. Yeah. got this.

507
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.680
Thank you.

508
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.600
Just go uh…

509
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.840
Ah. fuck. fuck. fuck!

510
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.360
Okay. Let me help.

511
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.120
-I can help.
-No. no. no. You know what?

512
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.080
It's fine. I can… I just need…

513
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.600
You need help.

514
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.480
I'd rather die!

515
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.560
-I'm coming in. It's alright…
-No. no. no. You know what. Grant.

516
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.760
-I actually think I could live like this.
-I'm in.

517
00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.240
Turn around.

518
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.560
Turn.

519
00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.640
Almost there. Turn around.

520
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.720
Okay.

521
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.920
Now. put your hands…

522
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.280
arms on my shoulders.

523
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.120
One and two.

524
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.560
Okay. Now. look at me.

525
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.360
Look at me.

526
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.440
I need to go down.

527
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.320
-Ready?
-Maybe… we should…

528
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.520
-Mm-hmm?
-We should count…

529
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.840
-Okay.
-…to three.

530
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.480
One… two…

531
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.840
I'll get it.

532
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.160
You left this.

533
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.040
Thanks.

534
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.680
What is wrong with you?

535
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.080
Um. p… pilates.

536
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.800
How hilarious was last night?

537
00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.640
So fun.

538
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.240
So um… I…

539
00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.080
Have you thought about what
you're going to do afterwards?

540
00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.200
-After what?
-I assume you can't move in with Diego.

541
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.920
-Ah shit!
-I thought…

542
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.640
if you have nowhere else to stay.
our cottage is always free.

543
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.280
He is cute.

544
00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.240
Is he?

545
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.320
Yeah.

546
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.120
All right.
I've got to go and fetch the kids.

547
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.840
Please remind me never to drink
Miriam's kosher wine ever again.

548
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.840
Never drink Miriam's kosher wine again.

549
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.480
Ow.

550
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.320
-Sondra?
-Jerry. what the… Carla was just here.

551
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.880
-What happened?
-Pilates.

552
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.360
I just came to apologize… mmh.

553
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.160
You can't.
The construction worker is here.

554
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.800
So?

555
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.920
Look. I take full responsibility. okay?

556
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.160
-As you should.
-But…

557
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.640
-But what?
-For the first time in years.

558
00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.480
I felt something.

559
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.920
In Judaism. right. there's this idea

560
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.120
that even before we're born.

561
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.920
God has already decided
who we're meant to be with.

562
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.760
It's like a… like a soul mate.

563
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.480
-It's called b'sheirt.
-Oh shit?

564
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.880
-B'sheirt.
-B'shat?

565
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.880
It means destiny.

566
00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.400
I used to think Carla was mine and…

567
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.800
But then…

568
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.240
Tell me you felt it?

569
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.920
-Oh Jerry. this is wrong.
-So you did feel something.

570
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.800
Carla is my best friend.

571
00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.440
Am I a total piece of shit

572
00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.600
if the only thing I feel guilty about is
that I don't feel guilty.

573
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.120
Jerry. you need to go.

574
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.680
Okay. okay. okay. But look.

575
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.560
At least. take this.

576
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.760
What the fuck is that?

577
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.280
Have you bought me a phone?

578
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.960
We owe it to ourselves to see
if there's something here.

579
00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.640
Are you fucking nuts. Jerry?

580
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.560
No. Jerry. Pick that phone up.

581
00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.640
Jerry!

582
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.440
Fuck. I really need
to close my fucking gate!

583
00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.840
This better be good.

584
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.680
Why?

585
00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920
Who?

586
00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.560
What?!

587
00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.840
Lungi! For the BBC?

588
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.880
Are you serious?

589
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.120
But wai… So…?

590
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.200
No. I don't… I don't have to audition?

591
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.120
Oh. my God. That's amazing.

592
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.240
Okay. yeah I'll send them. Okay. Bye.

593
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.560
I didn't mean to do that last one.

594
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.720
Ah.

595
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.440
F…

596
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.240
So I'm done for the day.

597
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.160
Please. baby Jesus. explain to me
why I decided to make pastry.

598
00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.560
I mean. I should have just
bought it from the store.

599
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.920
Who you trying to impress?

600
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.040
My mother.

601
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.680
She's coming to inspect the bathroom.

602
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.760
Oh.

603
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.800
What does 'cut in the cold fat' mean?

604
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.560
I'm going to need a knife and flour.

605
00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.520
Knife and flour.

606
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.560
Thank you.

607
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.600
-Knife.
-Oh.

608
00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.639
There you go.

609
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.440
I think we're going to need some music.

610
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.920
-Does that thing work?
-Yeah.

611
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.040
Okay.

612
00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.600
-Marlene.
-Cute.

613
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.440

That was impressive.

631
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.560
Pastry-making or seducing women
through the power of dance?

632
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.080
Huh uh…

633
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.960
It turns out once you get divorced.
you find time for a lot of things.

634
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.360
Like cooking shows.

635
00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.240
-You're divorced?
-Mm-hmm.

636
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.880
Sorry. I'm sorry.

637
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.480
So who was that guy. is…

638
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.080
Is he the new boyfriend?

639
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.280
No. he's my…

640
00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.520
Cou… He's my cousin.

641
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.240
Look. Sorry. It's none of my business.

642
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.680
I'll see you tomorrow.

643
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.640
-Grant.
-Mm-hmm?

644
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.360
Thank you. Very much.

645
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.240
Thirty minutes.

646
00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.080
Oh. yeah the… 30.

647
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.800
-Thirty?
-Thirty.

648
00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.520
Hey. babes. I just saw Noms

649
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.040
and she couldn't stop talking
about how funny last night was.

650
00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.640
You getting rimmed.

651
00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.640
Sorry babe. I pressed send too early
because I was still laughing at the image.

652
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.440
I'm just. I'm just saying
you need to unc--

653
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.040
I'm very disappointed.

654
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.760
The tiles. everything. So cheap.

655
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.680
Well. you didn't give me
a very big budget.

656
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.280
You've always had such cheap taste.

657
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.040
Like that drug addict who wore
the false Ralph Lauren shirts

658
00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.680
and sold all of your shoes
to buy more drugs. every single pair.

659
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.800
I mean all of them.

660
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.920
Well. you won't be having your flings
when you move back into our house.

661
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
When what?

662
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.520
-Not in a million years.
-Where are you going to go then?

663
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.040
-Huh? What?!
-Carla's cottage.

664
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.880
The tiles are cheap!

665
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.840
You need to take them all back
and get better ones.

666
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.840
-With what money?
-I mean. look at Raquel.

667
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.440
She has a husband. a home. a baby.

668
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.720
And she didn't buy
cheap tiles for her bathroom.

669
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.880
I'm going to be on the BBC.

670
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.040
You're too old to be on the BBC.

671
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.520
No. I'm not. I got the job today.

672
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.080
For a TV show and I didn't even audition.

673
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.560
They asked for me.

674
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.360
What do you want me to do? Hmm?

675
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.760
You want me to just…

676
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.560
…marry the first man
who comes along and buys me flowers

677
00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.640
and be miserable for the rest
of my life just to make you happy.

678
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.120
Yes! Better miserable with
a husband than miserable without.

679
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.200
Would you please answer your phone?

680
00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.680
It's not my ph…

681
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.880
Hello?

682
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.640
I'm having dinner
with my parents right now.

683
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.480
What?! No. I'm not sending
you a photo of what I'm wearing. Fuck!

684
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.800
-Why do you have two phones?
-Don't know.

685
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.880
Excuse me.

686
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.480
That sister of yours
has some real problems.

687
00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:16.960
Oh.

688
00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.680
Oh. Jesus.

689
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.680
-Dick.
-Who's a dick now?

690
00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.240
No. my cousin.

691
00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.640
How did you get in here?

692
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.240
Really need to start closing
your gate at night. babe.

693
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.440
Oh. fuck!

694
00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.920
-What's wrong?
-Something's up with Jerry. babe.

695
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.840
You know I give him
that once-a-month hand job?

696
00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.000
-His reward for putting up with you?
-Sex is currency.

697
00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.960
Last night. he said he was too tired.

698
00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.280
Oh no.

699
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.760
Maybe he was too tired.

700
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.640
This is Jerry we are talking about. Son.

701
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.000
Something is up with him. I know it.

702
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.280
And I'm going to find out what
or more like who?

703
00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.920
What? Don't. God.

704
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.200
Jerry would…
Jerry would never cheat on you.

705
00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.320
Who is messaging?

706
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.720
My sister. We're fighting.

707
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.800
Car…

708
00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.840
You're being paranoid.

709
00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.920
Jerry would never do that.

710
00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.440
I have to go. I've got to go.

711
00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.760
We start

712
00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.080
shooting today. with BBC.

713
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.440
I'm telling you.
something's up with that schmuck.

714
00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.160
BBC. BBC. BBC.

715
00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.360
Keys. keys. Fuck. Keys. Keys.

716
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.880
Oh.

717
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.400
-Hey.
-Hey. Grant.

718
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:14.040
-What are you doing here?
-I'm renovating your bathroom?

719
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.720
Right. Oh. shit.

720
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.160
-What?
-Uh… My mom hated it.

721
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.800
-The pie?
-No. no. no. The pie was delicious.

722
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.800
The tiles. She hates the tiles.
She thinks that they look cheap.

723
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.640
And I have to go back
to the store and get new ones.

724
00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.720
-You're kidding.
-And she's insisting I pay the excess.

725
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.840
-That's insane.
-You are more than welcome

726
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.120
to argue with my mother. Grant.

727
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.120
Yeah. No.

728
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.760
I mean. look. you can use
my tradesman's discount if you want.

729
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:40.040
Or I can take you back to the
tile and tap depot this afternoon.

730
00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.160
-Seriously?
-Hmm.

731
00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.280
-Thank you.
-Okay.

732
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.440
Ooh. I should go. My Uber's here.

733
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.120
Start uh… Start filming today.

734
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.800
With the BBC.

735
00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.320
You know. before you
I never met anyone on TV.

736
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.040
let alone the BBC.

737
00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.680
It's a historical re-enactment.

738
00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.360
Hmm. Period piece.

739
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.240
Girl. your brows were made for this role.

740
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.320
Thank you.

741
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:10.920
Lungi!

742
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.720
When you said this was
a historical reenactment.

743
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.800
Cut!

744
00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.000
Um… look.

745
00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.440
you've really got to get
into the physicality of it.

746
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.040
Right? You're an early human.

747
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.960
You don't even have a language yet.

748
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.560
So use your body to communicate.

749
00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.040
And attract.

750
00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.520
Sure. Yeah. Got it.

751
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.360
-Great.
-Cool.

752
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.840
And… action!

753
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.720
Cut.

754
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.880
Stop right there.

755
00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.520
I'm just going to cue you. Okay?

756
00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.560
-Cool.
-Cool. So. um. hunch down.

757
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.040
Lower.

758
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.720
Good.

759
00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.120
Um. now use your body to. to find him.

760
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.200
Look for him.

761
00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.520
You look for your mate.

762
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.720
Look around.

763
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.000
Turn left. Turn right.

764
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.600
Up. Down.

765
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.880
Great. You see him.

766
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.200
Now attract.

767
00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.360
No. don't pout.

768
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.240
Scowl. Let me see those teeth.

769
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.800
Scowl. Cut.

770
00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.040
What the fuck is a mating dance?

771
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.720
A ritualistic dance that gets performed
before the actual mating ritual.

772
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.920
We do it all the time.

773
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.120
Okay. fine. But like.
does it have to be so…

774
00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.800
Does it have
to be so unattractive?

775
00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.520
Your agent said that you have
experience in physical theatre?

776
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.600
I do.

777
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.840
So what's the problem?

778
00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.680
If you're unhappy with what is required.

779
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.080
then we can just recast.

780
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.800
♪ Girl. I wanna go to this dance ♪

781
00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.760
♪ Can't you see? ♪

782
00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:03.400
♪ All I wanna do is be free ♪

783
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.600
♪ Free. free. free ♪

784
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.480
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

785
00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:18.920
Okay.

786
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.720
-My big role for the BBC?
-Mm-hmm.

787
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.600
Turns out I'm a fucking Neanderthal.

788
00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.440
And a horny one at that.

789
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.600
I nearly threw out my back
from all the dry humping.

790
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.960
Why don't you just quit?

791
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.440
There must be loads of work
waiting for you. Hmm?

792
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.400
No?

793
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.000
What about the tile shop?

794
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.600
We're detouring.

795
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.440
Why do I need to leave my bag in the car?

796
00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.840
And now?

797
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.200
Just follow me.

798
00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.360
What are we doing here?

799
00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.960
Gents. can I have the yellow one. please?

800
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.720
Just mind your step.

801
00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.440
Oh. thank you.

802
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.880
Oh no. I'm not…

803
00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.480
I'm not getting in that thing.
This water is…

804
00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.120
gross.

805
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.680
It actually comes straight from
a spring in the Magaliesburg.

806
00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.200
Yeah. I don't care.

807
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.720
That is hideous.

808
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.760
I'm not getting in the boat. Grant.

809
00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.280
Close your eyes.

810
00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.760
Close your eyes.

811
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.760
Take it all in and…

812
00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.720
feel the air on your skin.

813
00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.480
Just enjoy it.

814
00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.080
You know I often just come here just to…

815
00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.280
just to feel present.

816
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.680
Being on the water just…

817
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.760
makes me feel alive.

818
00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.000
Carla says I should give up acting.

819
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.320
She says that dreams
in your thirties are embarrassing.

820
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.400
What do you think?

821
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.520
I think. um…

822
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.840
Sometimes I…

823
00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:49.720
I feel like I'm not living
the life I was supposed to be.

824
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.880
Or something.

825
00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.560
Who decides what life
you're supposed to be living?

826
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.560
Everyone who is not me.

827
00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.920
You can decide.

828
00:47:58.560 --> 00:47:59.920
I mean. you can decide

829
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.160
who you want to be or

830
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.360
what you wanna do.

831
00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.640
Do… Do these look cheap?

832
00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:26.880
I'm not even sure what that means.

833
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.400
Fuck.

834
00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.760
Instead of buying tiles
and then replacing them.

835
00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.800
why didn't your mother just give you
a bigger budget in the first place?

836
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.800
Talking about my mother here. Grant.

837
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.760
What does that mean?

838
00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.360
You…

839
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.280
You just flush money
down the toilet. Sondra.

840
00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.240
No wonder you're not married.

841
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.240
Men will take one look at you and run away

842
00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.880
because they know
you're going to waste their money!

843
00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.360
She can't say those things to you.

844
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.160
You know. I've had a lot of
disappointments in my life. Sondra.

845
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.800
But you are by far the biggest.

846
00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.440
You're kidding. right?

847
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.640
Everyone's got parents. right?

848
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.280
Mine are just finely attuned
to improving me.

849
00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.960
Well. you make it sound so funny.

850
00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.920
It's not funny at all.

851
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.880
These are beautiful.

852
00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.160
Jokes.

853
00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.440
It's not so bad.

854
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.680
Ah. I guess I could just go with these.

855
00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.920
-Hi.
-I need you.

856
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.080
Like. right now.

857
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.240
-It's a motherfucking emergency.
-I'm at the tile shop.

858
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.400
Which one?

859
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.440
I found it in Jerry's gym bag

860
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.920
as I was fishing out his disgusting
sweat-encrusted socks.

861
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.360
It's a secret phone.

862
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.320
And then I found this.

863
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:13.920
What… What is that?

864
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.440
Are you blind. it's a vagina.

865
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.400
Although the wax job
makes it look more like Friar Tuck.

866
00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.160
-It's not that bad.
-It's practically a comb-over.

867
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.280
It's not the point.

868
00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.800
That motherfucker is having
a motherfucking affair.

869
00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:27.600
Some cunt sent him a picture of her
actual cunt and I'm going to kill him.

870
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.040
Then I'm going to kill the bitch
who stole my husband.

871
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.480
-You are jumping to conclusions.
-Conclusions?

872
00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.680
It's not my vagina. is it?

873
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.360
Jesus. I can't believe you're on his side.

874
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.000
-I'm not on his side.
-Bullshit!

875
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.240
-Grant!
-Wait. What are you doing?

876
00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.680
Where are you going? What's happening?

877
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.720
I'm trying to get sympathy
from someone. Sondra.

878
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.120
Okay. Just leave Grant out of this. Just…

879
00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.920
The owner of that vagina
is a piece of shit.

880
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:50.880
Thank you.

881
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.680
-Are you okay?
-Quiet. Grant.

882
00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.600
‎Sorry.

883
00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.920
-What are you doing?
-I'm joining Tinder.

884
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.280
-Carla.
-Don't judge me.

885
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.400
I've been waiting to do this for years.

886
00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.120
And I'm going to get half of everything.

887
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.120
More than half and I'm moving in with you.

888
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.560
What?! What about the kids?

889
00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.160
I need a break.

890
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.240
Jerry has no idea how hard it is

891
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.040
looking after them day in. day out.

892
00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.920
My parents are about to kick me out. Car.

893
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.160
So we'll find a place together.
It'll be like old times.

894
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.840
No. no. no. You're not thinking clearly.

895
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.920
I think I am.

896
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.440
Party at ours tonight.

897
00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.160
Thank you so much. Grant.

898
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.400
Sorry about this.

899
00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.840
I just. I can't have a party
without a toilet. you know?

900
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.320
No problem.

901
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.640
I've been in Carla's position.

902
00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.040
so I get the need to blow off some steam.

903
00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.760
Do you want to. uh. stay for the party?

904
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.440
Okay.

905
00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:47.880
‎

906
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.320
Yes. Yes.

907
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.400
Yes.

908
00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.560
Oh. God. He's gross but yes.

909
00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.600
-Yes. Yes.
-Hey!

910
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:02.680
Apollo!

911
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.240
Apollo.

912
00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.440
Look at him.

913
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.360
Sure know how to throw a party.

914
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.640
You okay?

915
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.240
I honestly don't know.

916
00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.880
God. you guys are so boring.

917
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.840
Come to the bathroom.
I've got a surprise. Come.

918
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.520
Come to the bathroom.

919
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.640
I’ve gotta surprise for you.

920
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.240
Oh! Whoa!

921
00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.920
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

922
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.560
No. thanks. I don't do coke.

923
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.840
It's one little line.
It's not gonna hurt you.

924
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.280
No. I'm… I'm good.

925
00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.560
Look. after my wife left me.
I hit rock bottom

926
00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.240
and I don't want to go back there.

927
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.440
So I think I should leave.

928
00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.520
Hmm. Guess he's scratched off your list.

929
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.280
Divorced and a drug addict.

930
00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.480
Two no-nos for Son-son.

931
00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.320
Hmm.

932
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.880
Do that again.

933
00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.080
Faster. pony.

934
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.800
Harder. pony.

935
00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.440
Oh. you're so close.

936
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.920
So close to winning the Derby.

937
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.680
Son?

938
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:38.640
Son. wake up!

939
00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.800
I banged Apollo.
I banged the fucking drug dealer.

940
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.840
-I know. I heard.
-I think he stole my phone.

941
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.000
I don't remember if we used a condom.

942
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.840
I'm fucking insane.

943
00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.360
Okay. What do we do?

944
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.960
Well I. I need a bunch of tests.

945
00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.120
All the tests.

946
00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.680
And I need you to go out and get
me the morning-after pill right now.

947
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.640
-Please. Please.
-No. You go.

948
00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.120
Are you gonna help me
look after baby Apollo?

949
00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.880
Because I can feel this little
embryo growing inside me

950
00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.680
while we sit around here
debating the fucking issue.

951
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.240
Jesus.

952
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.360
Thank you.

953
00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.440
All right. guys.

954
00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.200
Daddy's got to go and talk to Aunty Son.

955
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.520
Just hold on for a minute.

956
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.360
Jerry. what the actual fuck?

957
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.160
Carla is inside the house.

958
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.240
What?!

959
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.600
-I thought she would have gone to a hotel.
-No. she's inside.

960
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:35.960
-Look. we need to talk.
-About what?

961
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.440
You can't just shut me out.

962
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.120
-We're in this together.
-No. Jerry. we're not.

963
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.200
Piss off. Jerry.

964
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.000
Look. I am out here
in the middle of the street.

965
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.240
-My wife is crashing--
-Shut up! Shut up!

966
00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:48.120
My wife is crashing on your couch.
My kids are in the car raising hell.

967
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.840
Now. I am not going anywhere
until you say something to me.

968
00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.120
You need to crack a window for them.

969
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.760
Huh? Oh. shit.

970
00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.840
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

971
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.000
Okay. Daddy's here.

972
00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.360
Okay. Okay. Okay.

973
00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.160
-You are the one who kissed me.
-No. I wasn't!

974
00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.280
Yes. you did. You opened this door.

975
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.480
The number you have
dialled is unavailable.

976
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.080
Please try again later.

977
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.800
Oh. you found your phone.

978
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.080
It's Jerry's phone.

979
00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.480
-Do you think this is a good one?
-What?

980
00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.640
The vagina.

981
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:39.400
It's average.

982
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.240
Clearly better than mine.

983
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.040
Since we had Levi.
it's never been the same.

984
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.800
Jerry loves you for more
than your vagina. Carla.

985
00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.960
I really fucked up. Son.

986
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.560
I can't believe
I cheated on Jerry last night.

987
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:06.040
You know. as I was um…
screwing Apollo.

988
00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.080
all I could think about was Jerry.

989
00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.320
How he… runs me a bubble bath

990
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.840
when he knows
the kids are getting too much.

991
00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.880
How he tells me I look gorgeous.

992
00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.120
even though I know I look terrible.

993
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.360
How he lets me binge-watch series

994
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.160
by taking the kids to Tasha's.

995
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.440
How he… he listens.

996
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.000
Really listens.

997
00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.880
I miss him.

998
00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.560
Son.

999
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:42.080
I even miss his…

1000
00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:46.480
crotchy Spandex cycling pants.

1001
00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:50.880
Do…

1002
00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.440
Do you think he'll take me back?

1003
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.200
Of course. he's going to take you back.

1004
00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.000
Everything's going to be okay.

1005
00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.080
Where are you going?

1006
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.400
I… I can't.

1007
00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:13.560
I can't run you a hot.
essential oil bubble bath because…

1008
00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:15.920
um…

1009
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.960
But I can go to the store
and I can get us some food before we die.

1010
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.280
Oh. thank God.

1011
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:27.960
Hello?

1012
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.520
Hey. it's me.

1013
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.160
Hey.

1014
00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.280
Hey.

1015
00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.200
It's good to see you.

1016
00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.240
I did kiss you.

1017
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:57.840
I'm the one
who started this whole thing and…

1018
00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.160
Jerry. you have
to understand. we're friends.

1019
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.800
There's nothing more between us.
And there never will be.

1020
00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.360
I felt something real.

1021
00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.360
Yeah. fine. There was…

1022
00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:14.560
There was something real.
But it cannot be between you and me.

1023
00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.320
I…

1024
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.960
I want someone who treats me
the way you treat Carla.

1025
00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:27.920
And I was looking for that
in the wrong place and I'm…

1026
00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.800
Fuck. I'm sorry.

1027
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.560
Well…

1028
00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.440
That sucks.

1029
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.440
Jerry. I know Carla's difficult.

1030
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.880
But you guys have a whole world together.

1031
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:50.880
You've literally loved her since the
moment you saw her on stage at varsity.

1032
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.840
And she loves you too.

1033
00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.640
More than she will ever admit.

1034
01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.600
This really sucks.

1035
01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.240
Everything's going to be okay.

1036
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.320
Yeah. what do you know?

1037
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.080
Okay. bye.

1038
01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.240
‎Fuck! Fuck!

1039
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.760
Jerry.

1040
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.440
Carla.

1041
01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.080
-Where are the kids?
-They're with Precious.

1042
01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.440
I want to come home.

1043
01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.680
I'm willing to forgive you for the affair.

1044
01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.840
But then maybe I'm not willing

1045
01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.080
to forgive you for being
a total asshole just yet.

1046
01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.080
-I don't think you understand--
-Do you have any idea

1047
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.800
how much I've changed for you.

1048
01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.480
I mean. I've worked hard to be
the man that you want me to be.

1049
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.440
to be the husband and father
that you want me to be.

1050
01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.400
But it's never good enough.

1051
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.840
I stuck by you when you were breaking
up with me all the time in varsity.

1052
01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.920
I stuck by you when you
gave up on your dreams.

1053
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.400
Through all your
bad behaviour. I was there.

1054
01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.920
I am still here.

1055
01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.840
Look. if you want to stay. fine.

1056
01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.400
But then we need to fix our shit.

1057
01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.120
And you need to stop
treating me like a punching bag

1058
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.240
and start treating…

1059
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.600
and start treating me as a partner.

1060
01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.720
Okay.

1061
01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.680
Okay?

1062
01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.760
Mommy!

1063
01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.520
You're kissing!

1064
01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.640
Just like Daddy and Auntie Sondra.

1065
01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.040
-Son. Sondra?
-I… Look. I can explain.

1066
01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.440
-Carla. Baby. Carla.
-Don't!

1067
01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.160
It's so gorgeous. Thank you.

1068
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.040
I'm just trying to impress your mom.

1069
01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.440
So I have something to ask you.

1070
01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.880
And it's totally cool
if it's not your thing.

1071
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.600
So I need to make a video for
social media to boost my business.

1072
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.520
And I thought maybe if you wanted.

1073
01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.960
you could act in it.

1074
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.960
I'd pay you. of course.

1075
01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.680
-Um…
-It's totally not your thing. hey?

1076
01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.840
-It's not your thing. It's totally cool.
-No…

1077
01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.360
-I'm flattered. No. no. no.
-It's fine.

1078
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.440
-It's okay.
-Okay no. Ask me again. Do it again.

1079
01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.600
Ask me. Go.

1080
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.360
-Um…
-Sondra!

1081
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.680
Two seconds.

1082
01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.800
Pull up your skirt and
show me your vagina.

1083
01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.000
-Huh?
-Lift up your fucking skirt. Sondra.

1084
01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.560
-Is everything okay?
-I'm not going to ask you again.

1085
01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.680
Lift up your skirt.

1086
01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.120
What's… What's going on? Some cunt

1087
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.080
sent this photo to my husband. Grant.

1088
01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:35.160
And I'm pretty sure that that botched
wax job belongs to that bitch.

1089
01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.120
Grant. I can explain. I can…

1090
01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.800
Show me. I want to see for myself.

1091
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.640
You know what?

1092
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.880
Enjoy your fucked-up life.

1093
01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.520
Grant.

1094
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.160
-Grant. I can absolutely explain.
-You know. I never took you…

1095
01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.720
took you for a horrible person.

1096
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.240
A mess. Yes.

1097
01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.800
Shallow? Maybe.

1098
01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.440
Entitled? Absolutely.

1099
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.520
Like… I took a chance

1100
01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.760
and then you have an affair
with your best friend's husband.

1101
01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.040
I didn't have an affair.

1102
01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.120
It was just a kiss and a… and a picture.

1103
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.280
But that's… that's all.

1104
01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.760
No one deserves to be cheated on.

1105
01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.680
-I didn't cheat. No. please…
-No one!

1106
01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.440
Trust me.

1107
01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.320
Grant. please do… I don…

1108
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.200
Cut!

1109
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.160
I don't know. Like…

1110
01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.960
It feels kind of forced.

1111
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.520
-It's a plastic doll.
-The doll I'm buying.

1112
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.440
Look. I know that this is a
very vulnerable scene but

1113
01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.640
it's about a real elemental intensity.

1114
01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.720
Right?

1115
01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.880
So. a deep kind of pain.

1116
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.480
If there's anything from
your past that you can use.

1117
01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.880
that you can bring to this moment.
then now is the time.

1118
01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:44.640
Right?

1119
01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.240
Perfect.

1120
01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.920
And action!

1121
01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.600
Yes. yes. Keep going!

1122
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.240
Keep going. Whatever you're using.

1123
01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.640
whatever you're doing.

1124
01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.200
It's amazing.

1125
01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.160
‎

1126
01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:55.920
Fuck.

1127
01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.359
Inside voices.

1128
01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:37.720
Kaylah. don't. Hello.

1129
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.880
It's me. Can I come in?

1130
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.800
Fucking Joburg.

1131
01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.120
Carla.

1132
01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.120
Carla!

1133
01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.279
Get the fuck out here.

1134
01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:29.600
-Carla!
-Fuck off. Sondra.

1135
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.399
Jerry. Jerry!

1136
01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:39.080
-Sondra. don't.
-Get outside and fucking talk to me.

1137
01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.160
-Put that thing down then.
-Fine.

1138
01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:48.680
What is on your face?

1139
01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.800
The BBC.

1140
01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.080
Now. I'm fucking sorry. but fuck you.

1141
01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.240
What?!

1142
01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.600
You heard me.

1143
01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.280
You kissed my husband
and exposed yourself to him.

1144
01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:04.360
You humiliated me on my 40th birthday.

1145
01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.360
-You make me feel like a piece of shit.
-You undermine me every chance you get.

1146
01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.320
You fucking hijacked
my life at that audition.

1147
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.440
For the last time!

1148
01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.080
I was trying to be supportive.

1149
01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.880
I didn't know
they were going to audition me.

1150
01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.240
-Then why did you know all the lines?
-I helped you rehearse.

1151
01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.440
-You are the fucking worst!
-You're not fucking better than me.

1152
01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.680
I did not destroy your life.

1153
01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.440
You were doing
a very good job on your own.

1154
01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.080
Does Jerry know about Apollo?

1155
01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.680
Don't you fucking dare.

1156
01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880
Jesus.

1157
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.960
So I need to tell you the truth.

1158
01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.480
I had sex with someone on the night

1159
01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.640
that I found
Sondra's vagina selfie on your phone.

1160
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.680
His name is Apollo. He's a drug dealer.

1161
01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.240
I'm so sorry.

1162
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.080
I was so angry.

1163
01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.680
And I know that's no excuse.

1164
01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:11.880
Hmm.

1165
01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.080
Was uh…

1166
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.040
Was it good?

1167
01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.880
-What?
-Was… Was it good?

1168
01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.840
It was…

1169
01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.400
th… thrilling.

1170
01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.160
No. babe. Hey. Hey.

1171
01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:41.240
It's okay.

1172
01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.160
It's okay.

1173
01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.240
Tell me about it.

1174
01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.960
If you remember um…

1175
01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.800
Sisko.

1176
01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.640
My… my horse from when I was

1177
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.760
-young.
-Mm-hmm.

1178
01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.640
Cut!

1179
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.520
That was absolutely fantastic.

1180
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.920
It's a wrap on Sondra. everyone.

1181
01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.440
Well done.

1182
01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.800
That was amazing.

1183
01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:52.480
I mean. it was so visceral. like you…

1184
01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.240
you just let go in those final moments.

1185
01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.320
Thank you so much.

1186
01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.560
And you know. I just want you to know

1187
01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.920
that you make a great Neanderthal.

1188
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.760
Such a natural. even without makeup I'd…

1189
01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:05.720
I'd buy it.

1190
01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.080
-Thank you.
-Well done.

1191
01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.800
Right. Moving on.

1192
01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.280
Let's go to our next scene.

1193
01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.080
Assistant. where's my coffee?

1194
01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.680
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

1195
01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.760
Stop it! Stop! Stop!

1196
01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.680
Mommy. Hi.

1197
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.280
No. No.

1198
01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.640
No. Mom. I wrapped yesterday.

1199
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.080
It's not on TV.
They have to edit it first.

1200
01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.240
Mom.

1201
01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.600
No. you know what. I…

1202
01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.920
I actually. I have. I've called you.

1203
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.160
I actually. I…

1204
01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.120
I actually need to ask you something.

1205
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.480
I have a question.

1206
01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.480
Um…

1207
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.640
The question that I'm about to ask you

1208
01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:32.880
is…

1209
01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.480
Can I… Can… Can I… Can…

1210
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.760
Can I come home?

1211
01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.080
It's a little bit spicy.

1212
01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.920
Oh. no I love spicy. Hmm.

1213
01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.160
Mikayla. that is delicious.

1214
01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.640
Thank you. my baby.

1215
01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:55.280
I'm going to cut some jelly.

1216
01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.720
Hi. One sec.

1217
01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.840
Okay. come in!

1218
01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.960
What is all this?

1219
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.160
It's a peace offering.

1220
01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.840
I'm not touching that.

1221
01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.800
Yeah. okay. Okay.

1222
01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.360
-I was an awful friend.
-I behaved

1223
01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:49.320
like a total childish pig.

1224
01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.240
I was a bad. bad friend.

1225
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.800
No. I was worse. Way worse.

1226
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.680
I told everyone
that Diego licked your arse.

1227
01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:55.960
I kissed your husband.

1228
01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.800
I fucked the drug dealer.

1229
01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.920
-I missed you.
-I missed you.

1230
01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:13.880
Is everything okay with you and Jerry?

1231
01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:17.400
It's actually better than ever.

1232
01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.560
We're talking. finally communicating.

1233
01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.720
-And the other stuff.
-Oh we haven't gotten there yet.

1234
01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.560
I was waiting
for my test results to come back.

1235
01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.680
I am clear.

1236
01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.600
Okay. Okay. Good.

1237
01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.880
-What is this?
-Right. okay.

1238
01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:35.600
So I bought this with some
of the money that I earned from the BBC.

1239
01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.400
I have this idea
that I want to talk to you about.

1240
01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:47.480
That is a terrible financial decision.

1241
01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.960
And…

1242
01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:55.920
Action.

1243
01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.480
Oh. Hi!

1244
01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.880
My poor friend Wilma's bathroom

1245
01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.160
is from the stone ages.

1246
01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:13.560
Her geyser leaks. her pipes keep bursting

1247
01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.200
and her tiles are…

1248
01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.800
positively prehistoric.

1249
01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.160
To be honest. I think it's affecting her.

1250
01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.240
With all the hunting
and gathering she does.

1251
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.600
She doesn't have time to
fix her bathroom herself.

1252
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.240
That's what I'm suggesting

1253
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.040
she calls Grant from Grant's Construction.

1254
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.360
Because not only can
he modernize a bathroom.

1255
01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.760
but he also knows how to wear shorts.

1256
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.160
Cut!

1257
01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.320
Very good. So impressive. Excellent.

1258
01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.960
-What?!
-Grant's Construction…

1259
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.040
Guys. this is… This is brilliant.

1260
01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:12.240
-Really?
-This is absolutely fucking brilliant.

1261
01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360
-Yeah.
-Mmm.

1262
01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:22.480
I can't believe I get to share
my stable with a stud like you.

1263
01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.880
Come on. Faster. pony.

1264
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.440
Harder. horsie.

1265
01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:29.120
Alright.

1266
01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1267
01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.040
-Very well. Very well.
-Oh. grab my mane.

1268
01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.800
-Grab my mane.
-Okay. Pulling it.

1269
01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.040
-Oh. put on my bridle.
-Okay. Don't shout at me.

1270
01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.240
-Put on my bridle!
-I think they're getting us a horse.

1271
01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.960
Would you like a coffee?

1272
01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.080
Hmm?

1273
01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.160
-Coffee? Okay.
-Sure.

1274
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.680
I told you if we cut those branches.

1275
01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.920
the hadedas would go nest somewhere else.

1276
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I told you.

1277
01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.200
But no. no. no. no.

1278
01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.600
You said. "Oh no. it'll give us
more sun in the garden."

1279
01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.760
Well. I mean. honestly.
I'm sick of it. I saw them.

1280
01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.800
They… They came and
ripped that whole nest down

1281
01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.320
and now they've moved next door.

1282
01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:27.960
I don't know.

1283
01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.120
It's so unfair.

1284
01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.720
Twenty-five years.
they've roosted here in the garden.

1285
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.840
nested and had their babies.
You know that. We've seen them. They…

1286
01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.400
Eat those olives.
I've told you. they're good for you.

1287
01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:46.120
-No!
-Yes.

1288
01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.800
That's what I'm suggesting.

1289
01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:08.600
She calls Grant from Grant's Construction

1290
01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:11.160
because not only
can he modernize a bathroom…

1291
01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.440
It's gone viral.

1292
01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.840
My video.

1293
01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.400
Lots of people watched it.

1294
01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.520
It's official.

1295
01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:27.360
The deal just came through last night.
You are looking at the owner of a salon.

1296
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.200
Aw. look here!

1297
01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.520
Isn't that amazing. Mommy?

1298
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.600
-Aw. Oh.
-I'm so excited.

1299
01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.280
Aw. that's wonderful.

1300
01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.560
It's going to be gorgeous.

1301
01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.120
-It's gonna be pink.
-I'm just proud of you.

1302
01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.480
-Wowee.
-Oh thank you. Sis. Oh.

1303
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.800
Are you the girl from
the Cave Woman video?

1304
01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:50.920
I am.

1305
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.040
Rad.

1306
01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.640
Okay. let's spread your cheeks.

1307
01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.640
Are you Sandra?

1308
01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.320
-It's Sondra.
-Sondra. sorry.

1309
01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.680
No. no worries.

1310
01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.160
Have a lie-down. I'll be right with you.

1311
01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.840
I think I'll just sit.

1312
01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.800
-Thanks.
-Okay. Suit yourself.

1313
01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.440
I um… saw your video.

1314
01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.160
Oh okay.

1315
01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.040
Okay. lift your arm.

1316
01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.680
Wait. I'm a TV producer.

1317
01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.360
We want to talk to you about

1318
01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.320
developing the characters
in your video into a show.

1319
01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.280
What?!

1320
01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.560
You're a Neanderthal.
She's a modern woman.

1321
01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.960
And you two
are best friends living together.

1322
01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.760
navigating love and life.

1323
01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:08.880
Think The Flintstones
meets Sex and the City.

1324
01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.080
So you're not my 10:00a.m. appointment?

1325
01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.320
No.

1326
01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:18.720
A TV show.

1327
01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:20.520
Carls.

1328
01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.240
Are you ready to be huge. friend?

1329
01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.000
Right?

1330
01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.000
-What's wrong?
-It's…

1331
01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.840
It's amazing.

1332
01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.560
And. and I'm so…

1333
01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:38.240
I'm so excited for you. Sondra.

1334
01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:42.800
But I think I'm good.

1335
01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.200
I think I'm good.

1336
01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:01.040
But when you blow up.
I am your plus one to everything.

1337
01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:05.320
And Jerry knows
that Chris Pratt is on my list

1338
01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:09.240
-and Mama's going to collect.
-I promise you. I won't fight you for him.

1339
01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.240
To you. Sondra da Silva.

1340
01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.040
-Thank you. my friend.
-I love you.

1341
01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.840
You can have Chris Pratt.
I like Chris Pine.

1342
01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.880
Mommy! Dad! I've got good news.

1343
01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.400
Ah. your friend Grant's here. Sondra.

1344
01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.640
He's cute. Why didn't you say he was cute?

1345
01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:25.120
And a business owner.

1346
01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:29.880
What good is cute when he took so long?
What took you so long. Grant?

1347
01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.840
-I'm sorry. Mrs. da Silva.
-Don't apologize to me.

1348
01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.120
Apologize to Sondra.

1349
01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.440
I'm sorry. Sondra.

1350
01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.760
Like. I know I should have come sooner.

1351
01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:44.880
But…

1352
01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.040
you…

1353
01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.480
-you're just hard to get a hold of and…
-Can't you Google. Grant?

1354
01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.040
Is there somewhere private
where we can talk?

1355
01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.960
No. Whatever you say to her.
you can say to us.

1356
01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.880
Thank you for the. the video
that you made for me.

1357
01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:06.000
I'm sure it did wonders for your business.

1358
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.960
It's had hundreds of thousands of hits.

1359
01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.400
Yes. it has. Mrs. da Silva.

1360
01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.640
And I'm expanding now.

1361
01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.440
So. I'm taking on a second team.

1362
01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.960
You see? And you have
my daughter to thank for that.

1363
01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.560
Mom. Relax.

1364
01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.360
That's what he's doing here. Okay?

1365
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.960
Sorry.

1366
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.280
Thanks.

1367
01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.120
Look. I just… I…

1368
01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.160
I just wanted to make amends

1369
01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:33.000
for like. being a terrible person.

1370
01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.520
You… you were right about…

1371
01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.720
About everything.

1372
01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.240
No.

1373
01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:42.520
I was wrong.

1374
01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.600
You know I was dead wrong.

1375
01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.640
Okay. Maybe I was a little bit right.

1376
01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.240
Because you are terrible.

1377
01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.400
But you're also wonderful.

1378
01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.080
And I like you.

1379
01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.040
I like you too.

1380
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.320
Well. you must kiss now.
Robert. tell them to kiss.

1381
01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.480
Kiss.

1382
01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.800
‎

1383
01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.600
You look amazing.

1384
01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.200
I love you.

1385
01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.640
You may now…

1386
