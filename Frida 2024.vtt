3
00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:19.955
In my life. I've only painted
the honest expression of myself.

4
00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:26.003
To say what I couldn't in any other way.

5
00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:32.426
I paint because I need to.

6
00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:41.347
Who would've thought
that stains of color can come to life

7
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.350
and help one live?

8
00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:52.024
Mexico was my entire universe.

9
00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:57.029
I was happy.

10
00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:10.459
I ran through every corner of my yard

11
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:16.090
and I'd shout and laugh from under a tree.

12
00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.902
My mom was obsessively religious.

13
00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:41.198
She invited priests to hold Mass at my house

14
00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:45.577
and her friends would come to pray the rosary.

15
00:04:46.704 --> 00:04:49.373
While everyone was praying

16
00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:53.585
I tried not to laugh.

17
00:04:57.131 --> 00:05:02.011
I remember asking about the
Mysteries of the Bible.

18
00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:10.144
They'd always say.
"To dedicate oneself more to God."

19
00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:26.285
But I kept bothering the priest
with questions.

20
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.997
How was Christ born?

21
00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:35.210
Was the Virgin Mary really a virgin?

22
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:45.262
They threw me out
for spoiling it for the other kids.

23
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:54.688
My father was a photographer.

24
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.776
I was fascinated with his studio.

25
00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:05.115
Papa was an atheist
and the only one in the house who read

26
00:06:05.783 --> 00:06:11.121
books about science. geography. and history.

27
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:20.547
I went everywhere with my father.

28
00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:25.803
He would paint small landscapes by the river

29
00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:30.474
with watercolors and oil paints.

30
00:06:36.105 --> 00:06:42.486
Papa kept his box of paints
tucked away in his studio.

31
00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:48.158
And I really wanted that box.

32
00:06:52.788 --> 00:06:54.039
Green

33
00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:57.793
good warm light

34
00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.671
Magenta

35
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.132
Aztec

36
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.093
Mexican red

37
00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:09.054
old blood of the prickly pear

38
00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.265
Brown

39
00:07:11.682 --> 00:07:13.308
color of molé

40
00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.227
earth

41
00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:18.147
Yellow

42
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:22.276
sun and happiness

43
00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:33.996
I was a girl who walked
through a world full of colors

44
00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:36.623
of tangible forms.

45
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:44.089
Everything was mysterious
and held secrets.

46
00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:59.438
Deciphering the world was like a game.

47
00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:23.795
I wanted to be a doctor

48
00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:27.925
so I attended the National Preparatory School.

49
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:38.518
I didn't like it at first because
I had to go upstairs with the other girls.

50
00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:41.897
All the girls would say

51
00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:44.816
"Frida is a little strange."

52
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.491
I ended up befriending a group called
the <i>Cachuchas.</i>

53
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.163
We wore caps

54
00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:01.625
and I was the only girl.

55
00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:14.554
When Frida arrived at the school
she was rebellious

56
00:09:14.638 --> 00:09:17.724
and defied tradition.

57
00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:25.732
She was drawn to rebellious young men

58
00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:29.486
and she joined our group.

59
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:42.874
I followed the <i>Cachuchas</i> everywhere

60
00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:47.963
and took part in all of their mischief.

61
00:09:57.556 --> 00:10:00.267
We strapped firecrackers on a dog

62
00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:02.936
and we sent it into the school.

63
00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:10.610
We wreaked havoc
and got all the classes suspended.

64
00:10:13.322 --> 00:10:18.535
Frida was standing in a hallway
dying of laughter.

65
00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:27.836
I would go to the boys' classes
instead of going to mine.

66
00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:30.213
I barely passed my classes

67
00:10:30.589 --> 00:10:33.425
or I would cheat to get good grades.

68
00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:46.438
Alejandro was a leader at school.

69
00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:51.443
He took part in all of the student protests.

70
00:10:53.362 --> 00:10:57.366
I'm attracted to intelligent people.

71
00:10:57.908 --> 00:11:02.871
I choose those I feel are superior to me.

72
00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:05.832
My Alex

73
00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.710
My beloved Alex

74
00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.213
My Alex

75
00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:17.469
I wanted Alejandro to fuck me

76
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.263
but he preferred to tell me nice things.

77
00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.349
He'd recite poetry

78
00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:25.435
and give me kisses and hugs.

79
00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.858
I think that everything
that gives pleasure is good.

80
00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.158
breath

81
00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:42.452
scent

82
00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:45.163
armpit

83
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.416
love

84
00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.044
abyss

85
00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:27.289
That day I took a bus with Alejandro.

86
00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:34.713
I sat next to the handrail
and Alejandro sat next to me.

87
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:40.093
Shortly after getting on the bus
the crash started.

88
00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:46.391
A trolley approached our bus slowly

89
00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.810
hitting us straight in the middle.

90
00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:55.567
The bus had a strange elasticity.

91
00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.945
It bent more and more.

92
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.782
When it reached its breaking point

93
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.368
it burst into a thousand pieces.

94
00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.503
It wasn't violent

95
00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.507
but silent.

96
00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.300
Slow.

97
00:13:21.218 --> 00:13:27.098
The handrail went through me
like a sword through a bull.

98
00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:33.522
It's a lie that one realizes the crash.

99
00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:37.108
A lie that one cries.

100
00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:41.571
I had no tears.

101
00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:48.703
I didn't understand
the kind of wounds I had suffered.

102
00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:53.542
I thought I came out unscathed.

103
00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:02.259
I ended up under the trolley.

104
00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:09.849
As soon as I was able to get up
I looked for Frida.

105
00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:18.275
Horrified. I realized that
a piece of iron had pierced her body.

106
00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:22.529
A man said. "We need to take it out."

107
00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:26.658
He put his knee on Frida's body
and pulled it out.

108
00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:36.918
Frida screamed so loud
you couldn't hear the ambulance's siren.

109
00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:45.552
CRASH WRECKS BUS

110
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.100
The doctors didn't think they could save her.

111
00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:14.539
It will take a long time
for the fracture in my pelvis to mend

112
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.043
and for the wounds in my foot to heal.

113
00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:26.718
The doctor thinks
I will have to stay like this

114
00:15:27.636 --> 00:15:30.472
for three or four months.

115
00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:44.110
I now inhabit a world of pain

116
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.239
transparent

117
00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.700
like ice.

118
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:54.287
It no longer holds mystery.

119
00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.761
The crash destroyed me

120
00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:12.555
but at least Lady Death didn't take me.

121
00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:20.647
Everyone tells me not to despair

122
00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:28.822
but no one knows what it's like for me

123
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.786
having been free in the streets all my life.

124
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:45.672
I feel trapped by the walls in my room.

125
00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:51.344
I'm alone with my soul.

126
00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:08.695
My mother devised a wooden contraption
where I could attach my papers.

127
00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:18.371
She also hung a mirror over my bed
so I could use myself as a model.

128
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.252
I started painting portraits of my friends.

129
00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.550
Dear Agustín

130
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.137
I painted your portrait with love.

131
00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.642
Beautiful Alicia

132
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:45.315
I'm sending you all my love.
Your pal. Friducha.

133
00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:50.278
Miguel. little brother

134
00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:53.656
don't ever forget about <i>Cachucha</i> number 9

135
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.867
Frida Kahlo.

136
00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.078
Alex

137
00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:02.207
this is so you don't forget me.

138
00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:05.502
Don't stop writing to me.

139
00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:12.050
Here is my portrait. Alex.

140
00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:15.845
It'll be at your house in a few days.

141
00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:20.975
I beg you. hang it low

142
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:26.523
so you can see it
as if you were looking straight at me.

143
00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:57.262
After a year in many casts

144
00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:03.268
I still felt very sore
and had little strength.

145
00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:12.610
But I want to be productive
with the health I have left.

146
00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:29.544
When the Revolution started
I was aware of what was happening.

147
00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:38.136
I was four when I witnessed Zapata's
peasant fight against the establishment.

148
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:48.688
The peasants took up arms to seize
the bread that the rich denied them.

149
00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.774
Land and freedom.

150
00:19:56.237 --> 00:20:03.077
In Mexico. <i>coraje</i> means
becoming violent when you face injustice.

151
00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:12.962
I feel the pain of the oppressed.

152
00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:17.342
I feel the need to fight for them.

153
00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:23.222
That's why as soon as they allowed me
to walk after the accident

154
00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:26.267
I joined the Communist party.

155
00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:37.111
MEXICAN ART REFLECTS NEW VALUES

156
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:40.698
ART AND REVOLUTION

157
00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:02.387
The spirit of the Revolution

158
00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:06.265
was the foundation for my determination.

159
00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:34.127
Diego Rivera was painting frescoes
at the Ministry of Education.

160
00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.643
Diego is a communist.

161
00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:56.274
His creative work is at the service of
the social revolution.

162
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.452
He has great taste.

163
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.290
He admires everything that emanates beauty

164
00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:18.880
whether it comes from a woman or a mountain.

165
00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:42.695
I had only seen him from far away
but I admired him greatly.

166
00:22:44.155 --> 00:22:49.577
One day I brought him four paintings
and just like that I said

167
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:52.914
"Diego! Get down!"

168
00:22:55.083 --> 00:23:00.463
I looked down from my scaffold
and saw a girl of about eighteen.

169
00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:06.177
She had a pretty body and a delicate face.

170
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:12.600
Look. I haven't come to flirt with you.

171
00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:17.605
Even though you're a womanizer
I've come to show you my paintings.

172
00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:24.403
If you're interested. let me know.
If not. that's fine.

173
00:23:24.612 --> 00:23:28.825
So I can find another way to help my parents.

174
00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:34.580
I was impressed.

175
00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:39.168
Her canvases revealed
an unusual expressive energy.

176
00:23:39.377 --> 00:23:44.173
"In my opinion. you must continue to paint."
I said at once.

177
00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:48.594
He told me. "You have talent."

178
00:23:49.846 --> 00:23:53.724
That's when my courtship with Diego began.

179
00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:19.959
Diego is a big kid.

180
00:24:20.668 --> 00:24:24.422
His bulging eyes are never still

181
00:24:24.797 --> 00:24:29.135
as if they were made for a painter.

182
00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:40.271
His fleshy lips always show
a mischievous and tender smile.

183
00:24:41.856 --> 00:24:44.400
She got a kick out of hearing him talk.

184
00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:50.364
She'd tease him and rile him up.

185
00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:10.885
Toad Face

186
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:16.515
Fatbelly

187
00:25:18.768 --> 00:25:20.728
Little Diego

188
00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:41.249
I used to dress like a boy.

189
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:49.423
But when I started seeing Diego
I put on traditional Tehuana dresses.

190
00:26:04.272 --> 00:26:08.901
You will be called Auxochrome
the one who captures color.

191
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:14.573
I. Chromophore. the one that gives color.

192
00:26:37.555 --> 00:26:41.726
DIEGO RIVERA IS MARRIED

193
00:26:42.852 --> 00:26:49.317
Everyone said it was like
marrying an elephant to a dove.

194
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.456
I want to have a son

195
00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:07.168
because this is a man's world.

196
00:27:08.502 --> 00:27:11.088
I want him to look like Diego.

197
00:27:13.674 --> 00:27:18.804
If I were to have a girl
I would like her to look a bit like me

198
00:27:19.722 --> 00:27:21.724
but prettier.

199
00:27:30.733 --> 00:27:35.654
I would go to see Diego every day
while he painted.

200
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:42.953
It pleased him to see me arrive
with food in a basket covered in flowers.

201
00:27:52.338 --> 00:27:56.133
I was working as much as seven days a week

202
00:27:56.217 --> 00:28:00.763
and 18 hours a day on government commissions.

203
00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:11.690
When an art dealer offered me a one-man show
at the Museum of Modern Art in New York

204
00:28:11.899 --> 00:28:14.193
I got incredibly excited.

205
00:28:15.444 --> 00:28:21.075
For an artist this is the pinnacle
of professional success.

206
00:28:33.963 --> 00:28:35.047
Here it is

207
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:36.966
the might

208
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.009
the power

209
00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:41.345
the glory

210
00:28:41.595 --> 00:28:43.848
the youthfulness of our lands.

211
00:29:01.532 --> 00:29:04.243
New York is so massive

212
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:08.289
I can't believe it was built by people.

213
00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:15.629
Our hotel is right in front of Central Park

214
00:29:16.297 --> 00:29:19.300
only a block away from 5th Avenue.

215
00:29:31.061 --> 00:29:35.524
Some neighborhoods in New York
are much more interesting than ours.

216
00:29:39.278 --> 00:29:41.030
We went to Harlem.

217
00:29:41.447 --> 00:29:43.782
It's a beautiful thing to see.

218
00:29:51.499 --> 00:29:55.461
There are immigrant communities
from every part of the world.

219
00:29:58.714 --> 00:30:03.010
The celebrations in Chinatown
feel like the ones in Mexico.

220
00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:06.597
Full of fireworks and colors.

221
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.655
We received a magnificent welcome

222
00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:27.576
and we were feted at parties.
dinners. and receptions.

223
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.205
Diego is the big shit here.

224
00:30:32.706 --> 00:30:38.462
High society people lead
the most stupid lives.

225
00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:47.221
They all spout nonsense
and brag about their millions.

226
00:30:49.348 --> 00:30:52.601
You also need to own tons of dresses.

227
00:30:53.477 --> 00:30:58.607
If you show up looking disheveled
they will eat you alive.

228
00:31:01.944 --> 00:31:04.280
But Mexico is in style now

229
00:31:04.905 --> 00:31:08.409
and all of my dresses catch their attention.

230
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:11.036
Their jaws drop

231
00:31:12.288 --> 00:31:17.793
because they're a bunch of idiots
who get excited over the dumbest things.

232
00:31:28.429 --> 00:31:32.600
Diego is painting two blocks from our hotel.

233
00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:45.571
I am also painting all the time.

234
00:31:47.865 --> 00:31:52.911
I paint things that are
heavily influenced by Diego.

235
00:31:57.666 --> 00:32:00.002
I've adapted to his style.

236
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:03.047
I try my best to make sure it's done well.

237
00:32:47.216 --> 00:32:50.594
Winter here is incredibly sad.

238
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.432
Everything becomes white suddenly.

239
00:32:55.766 --> 00:32:58.560
But people don't stop going out.

240
00:32:59.937 --> 00:33:02.481
I don't leave this place.

241
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.818
I can't walk much with my crooked spine.

242
00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:11.407
I'm always in pain.

243
00:33:12.241 --> 00:33:15.327
I'm weak and tired.

244
00:33:30.467 --> 00:33:32.261
I spend my days alone

245
00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:36.682
since Diego doesn't stop painting and painting

246
00:33:37.558 --> 00:33:43.188
and must tend to his affairs.

247
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:46.442
Diego

248
00:33:47.234 --> 00:33:49.987
I'm alone.

249
00:33:52.865 --> 00:33:55.451
I was never a faithful husband.

250
00:33:56.618 --> 00:33:59.913
I indulged my desires and had affairs.

251
00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:05.627
I often found women too desirable to resist.

252
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:15.345
I wanted the freedom to go after
anyone who caught my fancy.

253
00:34:19.725 --> 00:34:22.436
Frida didn't object to my infidelity.

254
00:34:22.895 --> 00:34:29.735
What offended her was when I chose women
unworthy of me or inferior to her.

255
00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:23.997
It all made me angry
and if I'm being honest. jealous.

256
00:35:26.667 --> 00:35:31.839
Why can't I get it through my head
that the affairs with all these women

257
00:35:32.214 --> 00:35:34.341
the English teachers

258
00:35:34.424 --> 00:35:36.093
the models

259
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:40.347
and the disciples captivated by your art

260
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.809
are just distractions.

261
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:49.523
Even though we fight and curse each other

262
00:35:49.523 --> 00:35:56.029
it all makes me realize that
I love you more than my own skin.

263
00:35:56.613 --> 00:35:59.533
And even if you don't love me the same

264
00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:03.871
you must love me a little bit. right?

265
00:36:22.306 --> 00:36:25.601
Diego's exhibition has been a success.

266
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.691
Two to three thousand people go every day.

267
00:36:36.153 --> 00:36:39.031
Diego's been offered a lot of new work.

268
00:36:39.865 --> 00:36:42.367
So now. we're headed to Detroit.

269
00:36:51.001 --> 00:36:53.795
All I want is to go to Mexico

270
00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:59.343
but Diego has dreams of painting
the steel industry.

271
00:37:09.019 --> 00:37:13.440
Detroit's Art Commission. led by Edsel Ford

272
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.569
invited me to paint murals
at the Detroit Institute of Arts.

273
00:37:19.488 --> 00:37:25.827
It was the largest sum
I had ever been offered to paint walls.

274
00:37:43.595 --> 00:37:45.973
He is in love with the factories

275
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.142
and the machines.

276
00:37:50.686 --> 00:37:54.564
Like a child with a new toy.

277
00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:11.206
Unfortunately. Diego has to work
for these rich jerks.

278
00:38:14.251 --> 00:38:20.132
He tells me that there will be
about three or four months of work here

279
00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:24.344
and then we can return to Mexico.

280
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.487
I'm two months pregnant.

281
00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:46.700
I don't know what to do.

282
00:38:53.498 --> 00:38:57.836
I don't think Diego wants to have a child.

283
00:38:59.087 --> 00:39:02.424
Diego only cares about painting.

284
00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:06.762
It's more important to him
than anything else in the world.

285
00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:12.309
Secondly. I'm not strong.

286
00:39:14.144 --> 00:39:17.981
The bus accident crushed my bones.

287
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.987
I doubt the baby would be healthy.

288
00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:34.664
Since I still have time to make
the best decision for my health

289
00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:40.170
I think I should have an abortion.

290
00:39:44.966 --> 00:39:51.431
The doctor told me I should keep the baby
instead of aborting it.

291
00:39:55.060 --> 00:40:03.485
Despite my poor health. he thinks I could
have the baby with a cesarean section.

292
00:40:07.823 --> 00:40:13.328
I don't know why the doctor thinks
it would be better for me to have the child.

293
00:40:14.996 --> 00:40:21.878
Since abortion is illegal here
maybe he's afraid.

294
00:40:36.017 --> 00:40:38.645
It's been almost two months.

295
00:40:40.147 --> 00:40:44.192
Now that I think I can withstand the pregnancy

296
00:40:44.985 --> 00:40:48.238
I'm excited to have the child.

297
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.806
I miscarried in the blink of an eye.

298
00:41:59.559 --> 00:42:04.397
The fetus didn't form. It was disintegrated.

299
00:42:06.942 --> 00:42:11.988
Who knows what the hell is wrong with my body?

300
00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:23.541
I had been so excited to have a little Diego
that I cried so much.

301
00:42:27.796 --> 00:42:30.423
They took me to Ford Hospital.

302
00:42:31.383 --> 00:42:34.511
The doctor didn't tell me what caused it.

303
00:42:34.928 --> 00:42:37.389
I don't know why I miscarried.

304
00:43:51.421 --> 00:43:55.550
I became obsessed with starting over.

305
00:43:57.093 --> 00:44:00.722
Painting things as I saw them

306
00:44:02.015 --> 00:44:04.351
through no one else's eyes

307
00:44:06.311 --> 00:44:07.937
but my own.

308
00:44:12.692 --> 00:44:15.153
My feelings

309
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.947
my moods

310
00:44:18.365 --> 00:44:23.828
and my profound reactions to life.

311
00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:57.070
The only thing I know

312
00:44:58.613 --> 00:45:01.282
is that I paint because I need to.

313
00:45:09.791 --> 00:45:12.043
How I wish to leave this place.

314
00:45:12.836 --> 00:45:17.841
I want to run and run until I get to Mexico.

315
00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:22.053
Frida would rather be in Mexico

316
00:45:22.303 --> 00:45:25.515
but I like the United States.

317
00:45:26.266 --> 00:45:28.435
I'm happier here.

318
00:45:42.782 --> 00:45:49.080
Nelson Rockefeller wanted the best artists
to beautify his new RCA building.

319
00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:03.303
I am completely disappointed
with the famous United States.

320
00:46:06.639 --> 00:46:12.770
Everything here is about appearances
but deep down it's a pile of shit.

321
00:46:15.482 --> 00:46:19.527
I've seen thousands of people
in the most terrible conditions

322
00:46:20.653 --> 00:46:23.239
without anything to eat
and nowhere to sleep.

323
00:46:30.997 --> 00:46:35.502
Rockefeller was fully acquainted
with my communist ideas.

324
00:46:38.004 --> 00:46:42.008
DIEGO RIVERA WITH HIS WIFE AND ASSISTANTS

325
00:46:43.259 --> 00:46:46.137
I was painting a revolutionary mural

326
00:46:46.513 --> 00:46:49.265
with workers marching and singing

327
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.144
and a figure of Lenin.

328
00:46:55.146 --> 00:46:58.608
I was quite aware that I was
going against public opinion.

329
00:47:04.697 --> 00:47:10.203
The private police at Radio City
gave me the order to stop work.

330
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:14.082
My mural was smashed to pieces.

331
00:47:18.294 --> 00:47:20.046
Stuck-up gringos.

332
00:47:20.213 --> 00:47:23.800
Motherfuckers. Sons of bitches.

333
00:47:26.052 --> 00:47:28.638
Because of the conflict with Rockefeller

334
00:47:28.721 --> 00:47:32.642
all my commissions in the United States
were canceled.

335
00:47:52.579 --> 00:47:57.166
Diego blames me for coming back
to godforsaken Mexico

336
00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:03.131
but I know it's not my fault.

337
00:48:07.468 --> 00:48:12.682
He has no desire to work
and gets angry a lot.

338
00:48:15.268 --> 00:48:21.733
It's painful that he thinks I'm to blame.

339
00:48:37.498 --> 00:48:42.462
I was instrumental in bringing
Trotsky to Mexico

340
00:48:42.962 --> 00:48:47.300
after every country in the world
had closed its doors.

341
00:48:48.801 --> 00:48:52.096
I was sick when Trotsky arrived

342
00:48:52.722 --> 00:48:56.684
so I asked Frida to welcome him
and his wife at the dock.

343
00:49:52.407 --> 00:50:00.665
I dedicate this painting to Leon Trotsky
with all my affection.

344
00:50:12.218 --> 00:50:15.054
I'm so tired of this old man.

345
00:51:03.269 --> 00:51:06.856
Make love. take a bath

346
00:51:07.732 --> 00:51:09.859
and make love again.

347
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:24.373
For me to fall in love
the person has to be sensitive

348
00:51:25.208 --> 00:51:29.837
and above all. I must be
sexually attracted to them.

349
00:51:36.302 --> 00:51:41.015
An affair lasts as long as it gives pleasure.

350
00:51:41.974 --> 00:51:47.063
It's good to have sex
even if one is not in love.

351
00:51:53.194 --> 00:51:57.532
During sex. my breasts play an active role.

352
00:51:58.574 --> 00:52:01.118
I get excited when they are touched.

353
00:52:06.833 --> 00:52:13.506
Nachito. I would like to spend
more time with you all on our own.

354
00:52:18.761 --> 00:52:21.639
Jacqueline. I have not forgotten you.

355
00:52:21.931 --> 00:52:26.185
The nights are long and punishing.

356
00:52:27.436 --> 00:52:34.902
Bartolí. last night I felt as if wings
caressed my entire body.

357
00:52:34.986 --> 00:52:40.992
As if your fingertips were lips
that kissed my skin.

358
00:53:14.942 --> 00:53:19.405
Love is the foundation of all life.

359
00:54:47.702 --> 00:54:53.082
The more I loved a woman
the more I wanted to hurt her.

360
00:54:54.125 --> 00:54:59.463
Frida was the main victim
of this disgusting trait.

361
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:03.884
I got involved with Frida's best friend

362
00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:08.139
her sister. Cristina.

363
00:55:18.399 --> 00:55:20.317
We were four sisters

364
00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:24.613
but Cristina was the sister
that I loved the most

365
00:55:25.197 --> 00:55:29.326
and who I tried to help whenever I could.

366
00:55:31.495 --> 00:55:34.874
Cristina is really pretty.

367
00:55:35.541 --> 00:55:38.169
As a child. I was very jealous of her.

368
00:55:38.377 --> 00:55:40.963
We would fight furiously.

369
00:55:42.089 --> 00:55:45.009
But she was my everything.

370
00:55:52.308 --> 00:55:57.521
I know that right now
Diego is more interested in my sister than me.

371
00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:02.902
It's all a load of crap.

372
00:56:03.569 --> 00:56:05.654
I can't forgive him.

373
00:56:06.947 --> 00:56:08.783
And that is all.

374
00:56:13.162 --> 00:56:14.747
Love

375
00:56:15.623 --> 00:56:17.083
Hate

376
00:56:18.209 --> 00:56:20.252
Madness

377
00:56:33.933 --> 00:56:37.728
I spend my days crying with rage.

378
00:56:38.687 --> 00:56:44.401
I'm just like any other girl
heartbroken by a man leaving her.

379
00:56:45.444 --> 00:56:47.947
I'm worthless.

380
00:56:48.823 --> 00:56:52.076
I can't do anything right.

381
00:56:53.369 --> 00:57:00.960
My situation is so idiotic
that I hate myself for it.

382
00:57:17.393 --> 00:57:21.564
Once Frida found out. she left me.

383
00:57:22.815 --> 00:57:24.692
It was too late.

384
00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:32.741
But if given another chance
I can't say I'd do anything differently.

385
00:57:35.578 --> 00:57:39.206
Every man is a product of his times

386
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:42.334
and I am what I am.

387
00:57:44.128 --> 00:57:48.632
I wanted to go to New York
but I had no money.

388
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.219
Now I live somewhere else.

389
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:59.101
Diego drops by once in a while
but we have nothing to say.

390
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:03.355
There is no connection between us anymore.

391
00:58:04.773 --> 00:58:12.323
He doesn't tell me about his life.
He's not interested in what I do or think.

392
00:58:14.325 --> 00:58:18.204
I loved her too much to make her suffer.

393
00:58:18.454 --> 00:58:25.085
So to prevent future heartaches
I pleaded with her to give me a divorce.

394
00:58:33.385 --> 00:58:36.680
Today I signed the divorce papers

395
00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:42.019
and I feel lousy because I truly love him.

396
00:58:45.981 --> 00:58:50.861
But I think this will finally give him
what he wants.

397
00:58:51.946 --> 00:58:59.286
I will no longer be a burden
keeping him from the freedom he demands.

398
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:22.601
After a few months I forgave my sister

399
00:59:23.435 --> 00:59:29.400
and I'm trying my best
to forget what happened and live.

400
00:59:42.288 --> 00:59:44.915
I'm learning to be alone

401
00:59:45.916 --> 00:59:50.254
and that is a small triumph.

402
00:59:53.632 --> 00:59:58.470
I've wasted my best years
being dependent on a man

403
00:59:58.929 --> 01:00:01.473
without doing anything for myself.

404
01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:10.649
I need to paint so I can make a living.

405
01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:14.194
Then I will be free.

406
01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.991
I no longer accept
a damn cent from Diego.

407
01:00:19.575 --> 01:00:24.496
I will never accept money
from any man until I die.

408
01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:35.799
I paint myself
because I'm what I know best.

409
01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:48.270
My self-portraits are the true expression
of my emotions.

410
01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:58.781
I was told not to paint so many sad things

411
01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:05.037
but I will paint whatever I want
even if the paintings don't sell.

412
01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:27.768
For the first time in my life
I sold one of my pieces.

413
01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:36.068
I now have a commission to paint
a self-portrait with monkeys.

414
01:01:37.236 --> 01:01:40.906
It seems that everyone wants monkeys.

415
01:01:41.115 --> 01:01:43.367
I don't know why.

416
01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:03.971
The Surrealist poet André Breton
came to Mexico.

417
01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.825
I never knew I was a Surrealist

418
01:03:07.034 --> 01:03:11.872
until André Breton came to Mexico
and told me I was one.

419
01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:20.464
I must confess I didn't even know
that this art movement existed.

420
01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:08.095
I adore surprises and the unexpected.

421
01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:11.765
But I never painted my dreams.

422
01:04:12.224 --> 01:04:15.852
I painted my own reality.

423
01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:38.542
Breton was so impressed with my work
he urged me to exhibit in Paris and New York.

424
01:04:53.473 --> 01:05:02.274
A Surrealist gallery in New York
invited me to do a solo exhibition.

425
01:05:03.942 --> 01:05:07.070
I've never had an exhibition before.

426
01:05:23.754 --> 01:05:26.632
Everything went wonderfully.

427
01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:31.094
I displayed 25 pieces and sold 12.

428
01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:40.687
From there I went to Paris
for an exhibition organized by André Breton.

429
01:05:55.535 --> 01:06:00.248
Ever since I arrived. it's been a shit show.

430
01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:04.252
My exhibition wasn't even set up.

431
01:06:04.503 --> 01:06:09.007
My paintings were waiting patiently for me
in customs.

432
01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:14.888
The son-of-a-bitch Breton
hadn't even gone to pick them up.

433
01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:20.519
Now Breton wants to exhibit my paintings

434
01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:24.523
along with common objects
he bought in Mexican markets.

435
01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:29.194
Ordinary crap.

436
01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:31.405
It's all junk.

437
01:06:36.952 --> 01:06:41.498
The exhibition will finally open
at the Pierre Colle gallery.

438
01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:44.918
They say it's one of the best ones here.

439
01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:52.634
There was quite a crowd at the opening.

440
01:06:54.094 --> 01:06:57.097
Huge congratulations from Joan Miró.

441
01:06:57.639 --> 01:07:00.892
Great praise from Kandinsky.

442
01:07:01.393 --> 01:07:06.773
And congratulations from Picasso
and other big <i>cacas</i> of Surrealism.

443
01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:14.448
But these rich bitches
don't want to buy anything.

444
01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:22.539
I don't have the honor of being
in the elite circle of famous artists.

445
01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:25.459
Men are kings.

446
01:07:25.876 --> 01:07:28.754
They rule the world.

447
01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:41.183
These people make me want to vomit.

448
01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:48.356
They sit in the cafés for hours
warming their precious asses.

449
01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:53.737
They talk endlessly about "culture"
"art" and "revolution."

450
01:07:54.404 --> 01:08:00.368
They poison the air
with theories that never come true.

451
01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.832
I hate Surrealism.

452
01:08:07.042 --> 01:08:11.755
It's a decadent manifestation
of bourgeois art.

453
01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:24.810
I am so sick of the whole affair.
To hell with everything.

454
01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:31.316
Fuck everything concerning Breton
and this lousy place.

455
01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:34.236
Let them eat shit.

456
01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:37.781
I am going home.

457
01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:54.256
I feel like hell.

458
01:08:55.465 --> 01:09:00.220
Exhausted by the constant pain in my back
that gets worse every day.

459
01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:16.152
I am fucked because of the accident.

460
01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:22.659
My foot always hurts.

461
01:09:23.952 --> 01:09:30.876
The nerves are damaged
and my foot will never be the same.

462
01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.671
It's hopeless.

463
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:48.476
All the doctors want me to have an operation.

464
01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:52.856
I'm scared.

465
01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:06.328
In the end. they proceeded to break bones.

466
01:10:07.621 --> 01:10:13.418
They tore off a piece of my pelvis
and fused it to my spine.

467
01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:30.143
The bone will take a long time
to grow and readjust.

468
01:10:31.353 --> 01:10:34.898
I'll have to stay in this hospital
for quite a while.

469
01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:42.030
It is hard to imagine my future.

470
01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:46.660
I can't think about it until I get well.

471
01:10:49.496 --> 01:10:54.709
Tree of hope. stay strong.

472
01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:20.235
Frida. I haven't known how to say this.

473
01:11:20.735 --> 01:11:26.324
I've never been able to admit
how much I love you

474
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:29.953
but now I'm sure of it.

475
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:36.042
Little girl. I'm terribly worried
about your illness.

476
01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:50.306
He tells me I am the woman
he loves above everyone else

477
01:11:50.724 --> 01:11:55.311
and he wants me to marry him again.

478
01:11:58.189 --> 01:12:03.695
I loved her and I begged her to marry me again

479
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:06.364
but without success.

480
01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:11.786
When she finally accepted
she did so with conditions.

481
01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:18.752
That she would support herself
with the earnings of her own work.

482
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:24.340
That I would only pay for half
of our home expenses.

483
01:12:25.133 --> 01:12:27.969
And that we wouldn't have sex with each other.

484
01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:33.641
When explaining this last condition. she said

485
01:12:34.434 --> 01:12:41.733
When I imagine you with all your other women
I can't make love to you.

486
01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:49.449
As soon as you start seducing me
I face a psychological barrier.

487
01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:57.582
I felt so happy to have her back
that I accepted all of her conditions.

488
01:12:57.999 --> 01:13:02.295
Frida and I got married for a second time.

489
01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:30.448
Our second marriage is going well.

490
01:13:32.242 --> 01:13:38.540
There is more mutual understanding.
No more jealousy or violent arguments.

491
01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:46.714
Each spouse does their part
to maintain the home.

492
01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:52.512
We'll be together forever.

493
01:13:54.139 --> 01:13:57.183
Nothing but love between us.

494
01:14:12.407 --> 01:14:14.075
My little boy

495
01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:20.456
I will build you a home with all of my love.

496
01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:35.221
I'm now teaching at an art school.

497
01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:46.441
And in the afternoons I dedicate myself
to the beauty of painting.

498
01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:55.783
As soon as I finish one I have to sell it
to earn enough money for the monthly expenses.

499
01:14:58.286 --> 01:15:00.663
If it weren't for my health

500
01:15:01.789 --> 01:15:04.626
you could even say that I'm happy.

501
01:15:23.478 --> 01:15:29.025
Up until 1950. I was doing well enough.

502
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:33.571
But now my health is at its worst.

503
01:15:38.493 --> 01:15:42.413
Frida became a professional patient.

504
01:15:43.373 --> 01:15:46.709
She had many surgical interventions

505
01:15:47.085 --> 01:15:50.755
a parade of doctors and orthopedic braces.

506
01:15:51.506 --> 01:15:55.093
They would hang her to straighten her spine.

507
01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:04.060
This is my reality.

508
01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.562
There is no remedy.

509
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.317
Despite it all
nothing is better than laughter.

510
01:16:11.943 --> 01:16:16.114
Laughing hard gives you strength.

511
01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:22.495
At the hospital. Frida made light of her pain

512
01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:26.124
and swore all the time.

513
01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:29.294
Fucking life.

514
01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:37.051
If she saw me with a pretty woman. she'd say

515
01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:41.306
Pass her to me. I'll take a puff.

516
01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.980
I'm always in a cast

517
01:16:49.439 --> 01:16:51.482
but I'm not discouraged.

518
01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:56.654
I have an enormous will to live.

519
01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:04.454
Long live life!

520
01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:32.440
I'm sure they will amputate my right leg.

521
01:17:34.192 --> 01:17:39.197
I don't know the details
but my doctors are concerned.

522
01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.344
I'm an invalid.

523
01:18:04.472 --> 01:18:12.730
Now I am trapped
in this fucking house of oblivion.

524
01:18:17.819 --> 01:18:19.695
Yellow

525
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.824
sickness

526
01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.951
fear

527
01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:30.790
All the ghosts wear this color.

528
01:18:33.543 --> 01:18:35.795
Red

529
01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:39.757
blood

530
01:18:46.514 --> 01:18:48.891
Black

531
01:18:51.269 --> 01:18:53.187
Nothing is black

532
01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:57.316
truly nothing.

533
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.036
I want to die.

534
01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:18.796
After the operation to amputate her leg

535
01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:21.424
everything was silent.

536
01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:27.597
Not even Diego's presence helped
and she didn't want to paint at all.

537
01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:31.058
The doctor said
not to force her to do anything

538
01:19:31.142 --> 01:19:33.519
because she didn't want to live anymore.

539
01:19:37.607 --> 01:19:41.152
But one morning. she looked up at me and said

540
01:19:41.903 --> 01:19:43.863
I think I'm going to paint.

541
01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:49.494
I had to bind her to her wheelchair
so she could sit up straight.

542
01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:05.259
In my life I've painted little

543
01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:11.015
without the slightest desire
for glory or ambition

544
01:20:13.351 --> 01:20:18.147
with the sole conviction
to give myself pleasure

545
01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:24.737
and the power to make a living with my trade.

546
01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:32.912
I've lost so many things I wanted for my life.

547
01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:38.376
But painting completed my life.

548
01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:12.827
I told Diego it was an outrage that we had
never held an exhibition for Frida in Mexico

549
01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:18.165
and what would he say about
holding one in my gallery.

550
01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:25.631
EXHIBITION OF FRIDA KAHLO'S
BODY OF WORK

551
01:21:33.973 --> 01:21:36.225
She arrived in an ambulance

552
01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:38.894
like a heroine.

553
01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:44.150
Frida sat in the middle of the room.

554
01:21:45.526 --> 01:21:51.532
She was pleased to see so many people
honoring her warmly.

555
01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:58.914
She said almost nothing.

556
01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:06.464
She must have realized
she was bidding life goodbye.

557
01:22:10.217 --> 01:22:12.678
I am not afraid of death.

558
01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:18.100
Even so. I must face the bitter fact

559
01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:22.938
that having many lives
would still not be enough

560
01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:27.777
for me to paint everything I want.

561
01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:50.508
What is joy?

562
01:22:52.093 --> 01:22:55.096
The creation born of discovery.

563
01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:09.944
The lonely deer wandered
very sad and very hurt

564
01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:14.532
until it found warmth and a home.

565
01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:23.124
When the deer returns strong. happy and healed

566
01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:29.422
the wounds he now bears
will all have been erased.

567
01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:40.099
Thank you for giving me solace.

568
01:23:41.726 --> 01:23:47.148
In the deer's forest. the sky is now clear.
