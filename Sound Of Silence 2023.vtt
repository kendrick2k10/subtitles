00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:41.857
Peter!

4
00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:53.521
Peter. what are you doing
up here?

5
00:02:53.564 --> 00:02:56.132
Dinner is almost ready.
Come eat!

6
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.742
In a minute.

7
00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:03.922
-I knew it.
-What?

8
00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:06.360
That you were working
on something.

9
00:03:06.403 --> 00:03:08.579
I found it
in one of those boxes.

10
00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:10.973
Um. I forgot I had it.

11
00:03:11.016 --> 00:03:13.105
It's great. isn't it?

12
00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:16.152
Great at taking up space
and collecting dust.

13
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.937
Like that clock
and everything else in here.

14
00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:28.643
Dinner in 15.

15
00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.690
-Mmm-hmm.
-"Mmm-hmm."

16
00:05:03.172 --> 00:05:04.826
Be quiet.

17
00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:08.395
Be quiet.

18
00:05:09.874 --> 00:05:11.920
He can hear us.

19
00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:14.879

Yo. it's your boy Ja' Ma

weekend. but... woo!

Nothing.

48
00:11:37.653 --> 00:11:39.481
I panicked again.

49
00:11:39.524 --> 00:11:41.091
Yeah.

50
00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:43.790
Was he the same creepy judge
from last time?

51
00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:45.705
Yeah.

52
00:11:45.748 --> 00:11:47.576
He must think I'm mute by now.

53
00:11:48.577 --> 00:11:49.447
Emma.

54
00:11:50.797 --> 00:11:52.581

Wait. what?

61
00:12:26.397 --> 00:12:28.182
Yeah. okay.
I'll call you back.

62
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.931
I'm leaving tonight.

63
00:12:37.974 --> 00:12:39.802
What happened?

64
00:12:39.846 --> 00:12:42.065
I need to go
back to Italy.

65
00:12:42.109 --> 00:12:43.458
Italy?

66
00:13:09.353 --> 00:13:10.877

All right.

70
00:13:26.893 --> 00:13:28.285

73
00:13:53.702 --> 00:13:55.922
-Hello. Seba.
-Hi. Miss Wilson.

74
00:14:01.014 --> 00:14:02.363
I don't know.

75
00:14:02.406 --> 00:14:04.278
They told me to wait here.

76
00:14:11.676 --> 00:14:13.287
I'll be right back.

77
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.366
-Is everything okay?
-I don't know yet.

78
00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:54.850
Your father
is in intensive care.

79
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.504
He's stable for now.

80
00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:57.897
but we have to keep
a close eye on him.

81
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.203
Intensive care?

82
00:15:00.247 --> 00:15:02.466
He suffered a concussion.

83
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.948
which caused a blood clot
to form in his brain.

84
00:15:05.992 --> 00:15:08.081
And he also has
a few broken ribs.

85
00:15:09.038 --> 00:15:10.605
Can I see him?

86
00:15:10.648 --> 00:15:14.348
Not yet. but I'll let you in
as soon as I can.

87
00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:17.960
Is he gonna be okay?

88
00:15:18.004 --> 00:15:20.006
We are treating him
with anticoagulants.

89
00:15:20.049 --> 00:15:22.704
We have to wait and see
how he responds

90
00:15:22.747 --> 00:15:24.184
to the medication.

91
00:15:24.227 --> 00:15:26.055
Otherwise he'll need surgery.

92
00:15:30.494 --> 00:15:35.412
Have you discussed
what happened with your mother?

93
00:15:35.456 --> 00:15:36.283
No.

94
00:15:36.326 --> 00:15:39.764
I mean. not yet.

95
00:15:39.808 --> 00:15:46.728
Your mother has bruises
on her neck. arms. and face.

96
00:15:52.125 --> 00:15:53.822
What are you saying?

97
00:15:56.607 --> 00:15:59.349
Your mother's wounds
are defensive.

98
00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:03.963
And victims of marital abuse
often protect their abuser.

99
00:16:05.138 --> 00:16:06.617
Miss...

100
00:16:08.228 --> 00:16:09.620
Talk to her.

101
00:16:11.753 --> 00:16:15.278
She pushed him...
down the stairs.

102
00:16:17.585 --> 00:16:21.981
I would keep her one more night
under observation.

103
00:16:24.374 --> 00:16:25.723
I'll wait in there.

104
00:16:43.045 --> 00:16:44.307
Mom.

105
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.794
Dad has had a concussion.

106
00:16:52.837 --> 00:16:55.449
He's in ICU.
but he's stable now.

107
00:16:55.492 --> 00:16:57.190
A concussion?

108
00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:09.245
They wanna keep you
in observation tonight. too.

109
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:10.855
It's just a precaution. okay?

110
00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:12.379
Emma--

111
00:17:12.422 --> 00:17:14.990
You don't have
to explain anything right now.

112
00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.340
I just want you to be okay.

113
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.353
He tried to kill me.
but it wasn't your father.

114
00:17:35.576 --> 00:17:37.795
We'll talk about it
tomorrow. okay?

115
00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:39.623
I'll go home and pick you up
in the morning.

116
00:17:39.667 --> 00:17:43.062
No. you can't go home!
No!

117
00:17:44.193 --> 00:17:46.674
Fine. I'll book a hotel.

118
00:17:46.717 --> 00:17:48.893
Take my car.
it's parked downstairs.

119
00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:50.373
Please. don't go home.

120
00:17:50.417 --> 00:17:51.896
Please!

121
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:02.342
Hey.

122
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:03.995
I'll book a hotel.

123
00:18:06.737 --> 00:18:07.825
No.

124
00:18:10.176 --> 00:18:11.916
We're going to my house.

125
00:18:20.708 --> 00:18:21.839
Scopa!

126
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:46.707
We need to fix this alarm.

127
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.622
It goes off for no reason.

128
00:20:08.816 --> 00:20:10.383
So...

129
00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:13.081
This is where the future
Ariana Grande was born. huh?

130
00:20:15.736 --> 00:20:17.694
Come. I'll show you something.

131
00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:47.115
So this was
your little secret getaway?

132
00:20:47.158 --> 00:20:48.247
Yeah.

133
00:20:49.639 --> 00:20:51.598
I've spent so many hours
in here.

134
00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:53.730
singing and playing.

135
00:20:54.731 --> 00:20:56.603
My parents built this studio

136
00:20:56.646 --> 00:20:58.387
so that I could scream
all I wanted.

137
00:20:58.431 --> 00:20:59.780
And now they're
cheering for you?

138
00:20:59.823 --> 00:21:00.911
Yeah.

139
00:21:04.828 --> 00:21:08.354
I sang with him
for the first time in here.

140
00:21:08.876 --> 00:21:10.269
My dad.

141
00:21:12.227 --> 00:21:14.664
We wrote so many
songs together.

142
00:21:18.102 --> 00:21:19.278
Hey.

143
00:21:20.496 --> 00:21:21.541
You want me to sing?

144
00:21:21.584 --> 00:21:22.846
Please don't.

145
00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:46.914
Wow!

146
00:21:48.742 --> 00:21:51.266
This is my dad's secret place.

147
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.616
There is a lot
of very weird stuff in here.

148
00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.141
Weird and old and broken.

149
00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:59.230
He loves fixing
this stuff.

150
00:22:04.105 --> 00:22:05.149
Hey.

151
00:22:06.542 --> 00:22:07.978
Everything is gonna be fine.

152
00:22:10.503 --> 00:22:13.549
I just can't believe
my dad would hurt my mom.

153
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.163
What about I make you
some dinner?

154
00:22:19.207 --> 00:22:20.469
Hmm?

155
00:22:22.036 --> 00:22:25.300
I'm just gonna stay here
a little longer. okay?

156
00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:27.302
Sure. Um...

157
00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:28.999
I'll be downstairs.

158
00:22:29.043 --> 00:22:30.131
Okay.

159
00:23:02.816 --> 00:23:04.948
What happened to you. Dad?

160
00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:48.992
Um. Emma!

161
00:23:49.036 --> 00:23:50.777
We have a situation here.

162
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:05.008
Um...

163
00:24:05.052 --> 00:24:07.271
Definitely can't eat that.

164
00:24:08.838 --> 00:24:11.362
There is the food truck
we saw before.

165
00:24:13.495 --> 00:24:15.236
Okay. how about this?

166
00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:17.194
I'll go. you stay here.

167
00:24:17.238 --> 00:24:19.632
Seba. no one
speaks English here.

168
00:24:19.675 --> 00:24:21.982
I think I can handle it.

169
00:24:22.025 --> 00:24:23.549
Okay.

170
00:24:23.592 --> 00:24:24.898
Take the car.

171
00:24:24.941 --> 00:24:27.901
No. I'll walk.
In case your mom calls.

172
00:24:32.035 --> 00:24:33.733
I have an idea.

173
00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:43.656
It's my mom's.

174
00:24:45.092 --> 00:24:46.528
Does it work?

175
00:24:46.572 --> 00:24:48.225
I mean. she uses it everyday.

176
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.725
Um...

177
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:38.640
Can I get two?

178
00:28:13.779 --> 00:28:16.477
Um... I forgot my wallet.

179
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.655
I forgot my wallet.

180
00:28:22.352 --> 00:28:25.399
No money.
no food. darling.

181
00:28:26.226 --> 00:28:27.749
Tomorrow?

182
00:28:52.034 --> 00:28:53.732
Oh. come on.

183
00:30:04.498 --> 00:30:06.326
Okay.

184
00:30:06.369 --> 00:30:07.806
Okay. you try.

185
00:30:12.201 --> 00:30:13.855
No. no.

186
00:30:13.899 --> 00:30:15.639
Not like that.

187
00:30:15.683 --> 00:30:17.903
You sound like a chicken!

188
00:30:17.946 --> 00:30:18.817
Okay.

189
