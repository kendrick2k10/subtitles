<i>Dave Hughes!</i>

6
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.958
Thank you!
I am super pumped up.

7
00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.442
How are we feeling tonight. everyone?

8
00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:41.516
- It is great to have you here.

9
00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:44.042
We are back. baby!
Are we back?

10
00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:47.917
<i>Yeah!</i>
- Yes. COVID no longer.

11
00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:49.834
No.

12
00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:51.267
Even on the news
the other night.

13
00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.375
they said there's new variants
you need to look out for. No!

14
00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:57.125
No! It's like Nokia
bringing out new phones.

15
00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:58.726
It's fucking over!

16
00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:03.150
We've moved on. You lost!

17
00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:05.125
No. it is great to be here though.

18
00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:07.031
and I know we
still take it seriously.

19
00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:08.517
There's a. yes.
there's a. yeah.

20
00:01:08.517 --> 00:01:10.584
a lot of people are here who
don't have masks on.

21
00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:12.275
so you don't give a fuck. obviously.

22
00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:13.609
Woo!

23
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.834
Fair enough. Yeah. woooo!

24
00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:18.025
<i>Woo!</i>
- Woo!

25
00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:21.008
Some people with masks on.
I appreciate that. Good on you.

26
00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:23.601
Yes. good on them as well. absolutely.

27
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.015
But if you wear a mask.

28
00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:27.125
you don't have to wear it
all the time. I don't reckon.

29
00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.109
You can relax occasionally.

30
00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.776
Saw a guy in his car
the other day on his own.

31
00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:36.325
Come on. mate.
You're on your own. Unmask!

32
00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:39.334
You're gonna get COVID
off the fuckin' radio. are ya?

33
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.874
I know. it's tough.

34
00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:45.934
I mean. we all had to
wear masks for a long time.

35
00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:47.793
And it was stressful.
wasn't it.

36
00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:49.751
when they'd slip
under your nostrils...

37
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:50.846
And someone would look at you

38
00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.330
like you had
your testicles out.

39
00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:58.142
But if you are wearing a mask.

40
00:01:58.142 --> 00:02:00.190
just... just... just... just
be consistent

41
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.839
with your personal safety.

42
00:02:02.018 --> 00:02:04.685
I saw a guy on Beach Road
on an electric scooter.

43
00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:08.577
I reckon he was doing 90k
an hour. looking at his phone.

44
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.932
no helmet on.
but he was wearing a mask.

45
00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:15.081
"When that truck hits you.

46
00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:16.834
"you're not getting COVID.
are ya. mate?"

47
00:02:20.632 --> 00:02:22.090
But no. we still care.

48
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.615
We don't care as much
as we used to.

49
00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:26.557
Do you know how many. ah.
cases there were today?

50
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.914
No. you don't give a fuck.
do ya?

51
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:31.773
It's probably thousands.
No-one gives a shit.

52
00:02:32.498 --> 00:02:35.101
Remember back when it was
every day. every day?

53
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:36.793
"What time's
the press conference on?"

54
00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:40.368
"What time's Dan speaking?"

55
00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:43.900
"It's not till 11am.
Fuck. what does that mean?"

56
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.109
- "Is everyone dead?"

57
00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:53.000
And then. when the press
conferences were on.

58
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.983
we would gather around the TV.

59
00:02:54.983 --> 00:02:56.664
"What's the number?"

60
00:02:57.601 --> 00:02:59.267
Like we were waiting
for the final number

61
00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:01.584
to win Powerball.

62
00:03:01.584 --> 00:03:04.234
"It's a two! It's a two!

63
00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:06.692
"Two people have got the 'rona.

64
00:03:06.692 --> 00:03:08.807
"Where are they?
What suburb?

65
00:03:08.807 --> 00:03:10.999
"Fuckin' bomb that suburb!

66
00:03:11.598 --> 00:03:14.137
"Build a wall.
They're all dead!"

67
00:03:14.983 --> 00:03:16.899
"We've gotta live!

68
00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.317
"Life is for the living!"

69
00:03:22.512 --> 00:03:24.355
It's unbelievable.

70
00:03:25.074 --> 00:03:26.241
And then I remember when...

71
00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:28.133
And then Dan...
One day Dan Andrews said.

72
00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:31.164
"And two people have died."
and we go. "Ohhh."

73
00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.565
Then he said. "They were
both in their hundreds."

74
00:03:33.565 --> 00:03:37.131
- No. it's a tragedy!

75
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.337
Two 107-year-olds are dead!

76
00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:43.697
The 'rona's taken the best
years of their life!

77
00:03:45.227 --> 00:03:47.810
They could've been staring
at a wall 'til next Tuesday!

78
00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:51.983
<i>And now they're dead!</i>

79
00:03:55.492 --> 00:03:57.425
And no-one can
go to their funeral.

80
00:03:57.425 --> 00:03:58.950
Oh. no!

81
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
Luckily. their friends died
30 fuckin' years ago.

82
00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.942
What about their children?
Even they died of old age!

83
00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:13.584
No. no. it was full on.

84
00:04:13.584 --> 00:04:15.109
It was full on.

85
00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.734
It was a crazy coupla years
we lived through. people.

86
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.017
It was crazy.
What about you now?

87
00:04:23.017 --> 00:04:24.698
If it had been a little
while ago. you'd be going.

88
00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:27.556
"What's the time?
We've gotta get home!

89
00:04:28.084 --> 00:04:30.209
"What about the curfew?"

90
00:04:31.942 --> 00:04:33.440
We forget real quick.

91
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.089
We couldn't leave the house
after nine o'clock at night.

92
00:04:36.285 --> 00:04:38.166
That was it.
you had to be home.

93
00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:39.839
I remember one night.
my wife said to me.

94
00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:42.020
"You put the bins out?"
I said. "No. I haven't."

95
00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:44.239
She said.
"It's quarter-past nine."

96
00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:46.131
I was like.
"I fuckin' can't do it now!"

97
00:04:48.317 --> 00:04:50.567
"I can't go out there now!"

98
00:04:51.942 --> 00:04:54.899
"If I go out there now.
I'm gonna get pepper sprayed.

99
00:04:57.859 --> 00:04:59.983
"I'll just throw 'em
over the fence."

100
00:05:05.983 --> 00:05:07.442
And there was...

101
00:05:07.442 --> 00:05:10.592
There was one... There was one
night where the kids said...

102
00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:13.242
Well. I didn't have sandwiches
ready for the next morning

103
00:05:13.442 --> 00:05:15.359
and I said.
"Well. it's after nine.

104
00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:17.192
"I can't get a loaf of bread."

105
00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:20.426
The kids are going. "What about
our sandwiches. Dad?"

106
00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.195
"There's nothing I can do!"

107
00:05:22.195 --> 00:05:26.512
From our front yard you can see
the light of the 7-Eleven.

108
00:05:26.637 --> 00:05:29.459
They said. "Dad. it's open!
You can go."

109
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:31.776
I said. "I can't. It's a trap.
I tell ya!"

110
00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:38.906
"If I scurry in there. bloody
Dan Andrews'll be in there...

111
00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:43.317
"..sucking on a Slurpee going.
'I'm fuckin' waiting for you.'"

112
00:05:45.818 --> 00:05:48.609
"I was waiting for you."

113
00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:54.359
Gosh. is Dan Andrews here?

114
00:05:54.359 --> 00:05:57.859
If you are here. Dan. come up
and slap me. I don't mind.

115
00:05:57.859 --> 00:05:59.567
Remember when Chris Rock

116
00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.966
got slapped by Will Smith
at the...?

117
00:06:02.109 --> 00:06:05.275
Chris Rock sold out
his world tour the next day.

118
00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:07.818
Dan can come up and kick me
in the dick. if he wants to.

119
00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:16.250
I've already had a vasectomy.
That's useless to me!

120
00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:21.250
<i>Woo!</i>
- Thank you. Woo! Woo!

121
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.751
No. I am pumped up.
I am pumped up.

122
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:25.275
And you are a great crowd
but I've...

123
00:06:25.275 --> 00:06:27.456
It's... Has everyone
already had.

124
00:06:27.456 --> 00:06:28.729
has everyone had COVID here?

125
00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.393
Anyone here
who hasn't had COVID?

126
00:06:30.393 --> 00:06:31.751
<i>Woo!</i>

127
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:33.899
Well. tonight's the night!

128
00:06:35.942 --> 00:06:37.942
<i>Woo!</i>

129
00:06:37.942 --> 00:06:40.359
It could be tonight!

130
00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:43.899
<i>Bring it on!
- "Bring it on." he says!</i>

131
00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:45.973
But if it is tonight.

132
00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:47.912
on behalf of everyone else
in the room.

133
00:06:47.912 --> 00:06:49.616
if you find out you've got
COVID tomorrow.

134
00:06:49.616 --> 00:06:53.048
everyone else in this room
needs you to shut the fuck up!

135
00:06:55.656 --> 00:06:58.805
No-one gives a shit anymore!

136
00:06:59.034 --> 00:07:01.556
I remember when I got COVID...
I mean. I got it.

137
00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:02.958
It took me
a long time to get it.

138
00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.734
but I had gigs I had to cancel.

139
00:07:04.734 --> 00:07:08.609
So I put the bloody...
I put my RAT on Instagram.

140
00:07:08.609 --> 00:07:10.818
thinking I might get
SOME sympathy.

141
00:07:10.818 --> 00:07:14.234
First comment.
"Get a haircut. fuckhead."

142
00:07:21.532 --> 00:07:24.532
Well. I can't for a week. mate!

143
00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:31.542
So. I was the last
in my family to get it.

144
00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:33.262
Everyone else got it before me

145
00:07:33.262 --> 00:07:35.459
and. ah. that was the time
if someone got it.

146
00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:37.115
everyone else
had to stay home.

147
00:07:37.115 --> 00:07:39.709
And. ah. I remember one day
my 11-year-old daughter was -

148
00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.692
she was coughing. coughing. coughing.

149
00:07:41.892 --> 00:07:44.600
I had a week of gigs booked.
I'm going. "Oh. I'm praying.

150
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.709
"oh. I hope
she's taken up smoking."

151
00:07:51.317 --> 00:07:53.983
I wanted to see a packet
of cigarettes in her lunchbox

152
00:07:53.983 --> 00:07:55.932
but no. I didn't. no.

153
00:07:55.932 --> 00:07:57.400
and she showed.
"Two lines. Dad."

154
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.084
I said. "Ooh. maybe
you're pregnant."

155
00:08:02.568 --> 00:08:03.693
But no. she wasn't.

156
00:08:03.693 --> 00:08:06.350
She got it and then bloody.
then bloody. you know.

157
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.417
the rest of them got it
and I didn't get it.

158
00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:09.806
And after a week. my wife said.

159
00:08:09.806 --> 00:08:11.831
"You're not showing me
any affection."

160
00:08:11.831 --> 00:08:13.859
"Yeah. 'cause you've got
the fuckin' 'rona!"

161
00:08:15.484 --> 00:08:17.859
"I'm the only one here
in the vulnerable age group!"

162
00:08:24.251 --> 00:08:25.626
And eventually. I got it

163
00:08:25.626 --> 00:08:27.642
and my two lines were glowing
so much I thought.

164
00:08:27.642 --> 00:08:30.542
"If this is a pregnancy test.
I'm gonna be Octomom."

165
00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:34.176
My wife did not give a shit!

166
00:08:34.306 --> 00:08:36.264
She said...
She actually said to me.

167
00:08:36.264 --> 00:08:37.955
"It'd be ironic
if you die now."

168
00:08:39.957 --> 00:08:42.574
They can play Alanis Morissette
at my funeral.

169
00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:45.692
No. we're... We're...
No. anyway.

170
00:08:47.038 --> 00:08:49.038
I can say that. 'cause
she's not here tonight. ah...

171
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:52.793
No. she's a great
supportive person of my career.

172
00:08:52.793 --> 00:08:54.651
although she's not as... No.

173
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.822
Anyway. my...
No. my family don't...

174
00:09:01.234 --> 00:09:03.100
I did a gig...
I did a gig the other night

175
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.667
and when I got home
I said.

176
00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:06.933
"Honey. the crowd tonight
said I was amazing."

177
00:09:06.933 --> 00:09:08.709
She said. "People are nice.
aren't they?"

178
00:09:13.758 --> 00:09:15.918
The kids don't give a shit.

179
00:09:16.331 --> 00:09:17.874
My son's 13.

180
00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:19.358
I've got an
11-year-old daughter

181
00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:22.390
and a 9-year-old daughter.
and they've got no interest.

182
00:09:22.664 --> 00:09:25.122
no interest
in their father's career.

183
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.012
My son's completely anti
my career.

184
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.359
Like. he actively
undermines my confidence.

185
00:09:31.547 --> 00:09:32.714
I swear to God!

186
00:09:32.714 --> 00:09:34.125
The other night he got home.
he said.

187
00:09:34.125 --> 00:09:37.032
"Dad. my art teacher
doesn't think you're funny."

188
00:09:39.218 --> 00:09:41.218
Ohhh! I said.
"Well. that's a coincidence.

189
00:09:41.218 --> 00:09:42.265
"'cause when I was
at school

190
00:09:42.265 --> 00:09:44.532
"my art teacher didn't think
I was funny either. mate.

191
00:09:45.071 --> 00:09:47.488
"And now I'm rich
and she's dead."

192
00:09:55.776 --> 00:09:57.883
No. I mean. his art teacher
didn't think I was...

193
00:09:57.883 --> 00:09:59.470
whatever. good on her.

194
00:10:00.017 --> 00:10:02.454
No-one at his school apparently
knows I'm his father

195
00:10:02.454 --> 00:10:04.025
and he wants to keep it
that way.

196
00:10:05.168 --> 00:10:06.626
"You're embarrassing. Dad."

197
00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:08.086
"Yeah. I am and guess what?

198
00:10:08.086 --> 00:10:10.793
"My embarrassment paid for
your fuckin' iPad. mate. so..."

199
00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:20.824
No. no.
Well. it did. basically.

200
00:10:21.047 --> 00:10:23.356
No. no. he's a... He's a good
lad. he's a good lad

201
00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:25.584
but. I mean. he brought
some friends over the other day

202
00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:27.751
and he said.
"Can you stay upstairs. Dad?"

203
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:30.167
- "Don't come down!"

204
00:10:30.267 --> 00:10:31.809
I had to stay upstairs.

205
00:10:31.809 --> 00:10:33.792
like I was the mental cousin
in the attic.

206
00:10:37.417 --> 00:10:40.417
I just started making noises.
"Aaaargh!"

207
00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:45.329
"Aaaargh!"

208
00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:49.985
Anyway... No. he's a good lad.
He's a good lad.

209
00:10:50.175 --> 00:10:52.434
He also doesn't...
Yeah. anyway. whatever.

210
00:10:52.434 --> 00:10:54.643
He thinks his mother's
too good for me.

211
00:10:55.002 --> 00:10:57.171
We were walking down the street
as a family

212
00:10:57.171 --> 00:10:59.195
and he said to his mother.
"You don't have to worry

213
00:10:59.195 --> 00:11:00.727
"about Dad cheating on you.
Mum..."

214
00:11:04.117 --> 00:11:06.312
"..'cause no-one else
finds him attractive!"

215
00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:07.850
"Is that right. mate?

216
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.750
"Have you done a survey
of everyone. have ya?

217
00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:12.871
"See the way that lollipop lady
over there gave me the eye?

218
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:14.630
"I might go over and pash her
right now!"

219
00:11:18.638 --> 00:11:19.932
No. it is great to be here

220
00:11:19.932 --> 00:11:21.667
and you are the best crowd
I've ever had.

221
00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:26.834
I've never been more pumped up!
This is the night of our lives!

222
00:11:26.834 --> 00:11:28.983
- And good on you!

223
00:11:28.983 --> 00:11:32.175
Good on you!<i>- (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</i>

224
00:11:32.175 --> 00:11:36.473
Good on you for finding
your way into the CBD!

225
00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:39.121
Who here came on a bicycle?

226
00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:40.708
No-one.

227
00:11:40.708 --> 00:11:43.399
Those bike lanes are real worth
the effort. aren't they?

228
00:11:45.423 --> 00:11:48.090
Who's waiting for Metro Tunnel
to be finished?

229
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.318
No. they're not here.

230
00:11:49.318 --> 00:11:51.426
They won't be here
for another 30 fuckin' years!

231
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:55.777
How long are they digging for?

232
00:11:56.292 --> 00:11:59.417
They stopped digging recently
and I said. "Oh. no. wha-..."

233
00:11:59.417 --> 00:12:01.206
They said they've
stopped digging

234
00:12:01.206 --> 00:12:02.958
'cause the dirt's
contaminated.

235
00:12:03.465 --> 00:12:05.642
Stop testing the dirt!

236
00:12:07.851 --> 00:12:10.684
Dirt is meant to be dirty.
for fuck's sake!

237
00:12:10.684 --> 00:12:15.000
- That's why it's dirt!

238
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.734
"Yeah. but we've gotta
put it somewhere."

239
00:12:16.734 --> 00:12:19.181
Well. don't tell the people
you're putting it...

240
00:12:19.332 --> 00:12:21.090
...that it's dirty!

241
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.874
Just dump it in the Yarra.
Who gives a fuck?

242
00:12:27.642 --> 00:12:30.892
Anyway. no. it is...
It is great to be here

243
00:12:30.892 --> 00:12:33.417
and I do appreciate you
coming along. you know?

244
00:12:33.644 --> 00:12:35.477
Not everything survived
the bloody. ah.

245
00:12:35.477 --> 00:12:37.250
the pandemic though. did it?
No.

246
00:12:37.525 --> 00:12:41.845
The Docklands Wheel.
that's no longer going.

247
00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:43.329
Can you believe that?

248
00:12:43.643 --> 00:12:45.899
I can't believe
the bloody lockdown

249
00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:47.861
affected the Docklands at all.

250
00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:51.170
That joint's been in lockdown
for 20 years. for fuck's sake.

251
00:12:53.458 --> 00:12:55.409
If anyone's used to no people
being there.

252
00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:57.167
it's the Docklands.

253
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.234
You live in the Docklands?
Good on you.

254
00:13:02.434 --> 00:13:03.851
And you're out tonight.

255
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:05.586
Have you been on
the Docklands Wheel?

256
00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:07.528
- You haven't. alright.

257
00:13:10.317 --> 00:13:12.025
Who else has been on
the Docklands Wheel?

258
00:13:12.225 --> 00:13:15.475
Seven of you.
Well worth the $700 million.

259
00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:20.900
Massive Ferris wheel.
What a waste of money.

260
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.763
I went on it once
'cause my brother.

261
00:13:22.763 --> 00:13:24.661
my 53-year-old brother. Mick...

262
00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:26.209
<i>Go. Mick!
- You like Mick?</i>

263
00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:28.275
Well. he's single. if you're
into it. Anyway. ah...

264
00:13:29.993 --> 00:13:32.744
Mick. if you're watching
this at home. I've...

265
00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:34.875
I'm gonna get her number
for ya!

266
00:13:36.792 --> 00:13:39.058
He's a 53-year-old cheesemaker.

267
00:13:39.058 --> 00:13:40.709
so. yeah. if you're
into Cracker Barrel.

268
00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:42.734
you could have
a lifetime supply.

269
00:13:46.334 --> 00:13:48.068
He is single by the way.
Ah. anyway.

270
00:13:48.068 --> 00:13:50.513
Mick came down from our
hometown of Warrnambool

271
00:13:50.513 --> 00:13:51.809
on a Tuesday.

272
00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:53.726
He said. "Dave."
One clap.

273
00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:57.501
He said. "Dave. I wanna go on
the Docklands Wheel."

274
00:13:57.501 --> 00:13:59.109
I said. "Mick. if that's
your dream..."

275
00:14:01.651 --> 00:14:05.102
"..I'm gonna help you
make that happen."

276
00:14:05.226 --> 00:14:06.601
He said. "Should we book?"

277
00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:09.001
I said. "I don't think that's
gonna be necessary."

278
00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:14.334
"I reckon we take a chance!"

279
00:14:16.026 --> 00:14:19.651
And we turned up on a Tuesday
and we were OK.

280
00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:23.548
Apparently. for 15 bucks each.
we hired the whole thing out.

281
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.609
Oh. it was an exciting ride.

282
00:14:28.609 --> 00:14:31.150
When we got in. they said.
"Strap yourself in.

283
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.109
"you're about to be launched."

284
00:14:33.109 --> 00:14:36.067
What the fuck?
It's a Ferris wheel.

285
00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:39.120
I kid you not. when we got to
the top the voiceover said.

286
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.501
"Behind those buildings
over there to the east

287
00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:44.329
"is the world-famous MCG."

288
00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:47.626
Well. we're gonna have to take
your word for it. aren't we.

289
00:14:47.725 --> 00:14:50.600
because we should've gone
to Eureka. 'cause we...

290
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.934
All we can see from here

291
00:14:51.934 --> 00:14:54.459
is a burglary happening
at West Footscray. basically.

292
00:15:00.804 --> 00:15:03.530
I love you guys. you're
the best crowd I've ever had.

293
00:15:03.992 --> 00:15:06.158
It's the night of my life!

294
00:15:06.359 --> 00:15:08.567
Anyone been on a plane
recently?

295
00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:10.782
<i>Yeah!</i>
- Yeah. and you made it.

296
00:15:10.782 --> 00:15:12.525
Unbelievable!

297
00:15:12.525 --> 00:15:14.758
What has happened to Qantas?

298
00:15:14.983 --> 00:15:16.818
Honestly. they've shat the bed.

299
00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:19.309
I can't say that on radio

300
00:15:19.309 --> 00:15:21.250
'cause they sponsor my show
but. ah...

301
00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:31.626
But they have. haven't they?

302
00:15:31.626 --> 00:15:33.375
I mean. they all have.

303
00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:35.609
I don't know. it's COVID.
apparently. but full on.

304
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.932
I don't know where the focus
is going these days.

305
00:15:37.932 --> 00:15:40.705
They were landing the other day
and the pilot said.

306
00:15:40.705 --> 00:15:43.400
"I'd like to acknowledge the
spiritual owners of the land."

307
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.526
Fair enough. mate.
you gonna pay them any rent?

308
00:15:45.526 --> 00:15:47.651
Wouldn't have thought so.

309
00:15:47.651 --> 00:15:48.793
How about acknowledging

310
00:15:48.793 --> 00:15:51.900
the spiritual owners of the
bags that you've lost. alright?

311
00:15:56.609 --> 00:15:59.900
I don't know if they're looking
after customers well enough.

312
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.184
I went there one morning.
the Qantas lounge. right.

313
00:16:02.184 --> 00:16:03.793
frequent flyer. and I...

314
00:16:03.793 --> 00:16:06.226
It was nine o'clock.
And I don't drink. by the way.

315
00:16:06.226 --> 00:16:08.211
I look like I do. but I don't.

316
00:16:09.098 --> 00:16:11.597
I haven't had a drink for
almost 30 years. yeah?

317
00:16:11.597 --> 00:16:13.084
Whatever.
It's not an AA meeting.

318
00:16:13.084 --> 00:16:15.692
- But I haven't.

319
00:16:15.692 --> 00:16:17.954
But almost every single day

320
00:16:17.954 --> 00:16:20.510
someone will accuse me
of having a hangover

321
00:16:20.918 --> 00:16:22.751
and it's annoying.

322
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.447
I was at the Qantas lounge. 9am.

323
00:16:24.447 --> 00:16:25.698
Woman behind the counter said.

324
00:16:25.698 --> 00:16:27.098
"You must've had
a rough night?"

325
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.923
- I'd had nine hours sleep!

326
00:16:32.793 --> 00:16:35.334
I said. "Nup. but I'm having
a rough mornin'."

327
00:16:35.334 --> 00:16:36.874
She said. "Why?"

328
00:16:36.874 --> 00:16:38.734
I said. "I just met a fuckwit.
to be honest."

329
00:16:40.216 --> 00:16:42.116
She said. "When?"
I said. "Just here."

330
00:16:44.359 --> 00:16:45.983
She's looking round.

331
00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:51.983
Just the two of us there.
Mmmm. do the maths.

332
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.151
Look into my glassy eyes.

333
00:16:54.151 --> 00:16:56.334
you'll see reflected back
a fuckwit!

334
00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:04.067
Anyway. So. anyway.
I'm an interesting individual.

335
00:17:04.353 --> 00:17:06.312
I don't d-... I've given
a lot of things up. guys.

336
00:17:06.312 --> 00:17:08.459
I've become a vegan.
Any other vegans in the room?

337
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.221
Fuckin' thanks for the support.

338
00:17:12.871 --> 00:17:15.063
Is there one. halfway back. yeah?

339
00:17:15.063 --> 00:17:17.603
Good on you. It's not... Two!
Two vegans together.

340
00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:20.635
Well done. you found each other
and we appreciate that.

341
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:24.643
It's a lonely existence.
being a vegan.

342
00:17:24.899 --> 00:17:27.234
Christmas is not...
It's not good.

343
00:17:27.495 --> 00:17:31.126
We had a pre-Christmas dinner
at my mother-in-law's house.

344
00:17:31.126 --> 00:17:32.268
There's a number of people there.

345
00:17:32.268 --> 00:17:33.451
some of them I didn't know.

346
00:17:33.451 --> 00:17:36.184
She announced to everyone.
"All the food's vegan tonight."

347
00:17:36.184 --> 00:17:40.084
You should've seen the
look of sadness in their eyes.

348
00:17:40.084 --> 00:17:42.192
Then she said. "'Cause of him."

349
00:17:43.869 --> 00:17:47.034
My own son said. "Dad. why
do you even have to be here?"

350
00:17:52.041 --> 00:17:54.375
Anyway. I was on a plane
the other day

351
00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:56.067
and they had muesli

352
00:17:56.067 --> 00:17:57.859
and that had
cow's milk with it.

353
00:17:57.859 --> 00:17:59.009
and I said to
the flight attendant.

354
00:17:59.009 --> 00:18:00.617
"Can I get some soy milk?"

355
00:18:00.776 --> 00:18:02.338
And they said.
"We don't have soy milk."

356
00:18:02.338 --> 00:18:03.659
I said. "Ohhh."

357
00:18:03.954 --> 00:18:06.202
Then the flight attendant
came back

358
00:18:06.202 --> 00:18:08.656
and said. ah.
"You can eat it dry.

359
00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:10.632
"I do that sometimes."

360
00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:13.215
I said. "Fuck. thanks.
Bear Grylls."

361
00:18:15.692 --> 00:18:18.192
"Could I urinate on it as well.
maybe?"

362
00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:22.914
Anyway. no.
it is great to be here

363
00:18:22.914 --> 00:18:23.954
and I've never been
more pumped up.

364
00:18:23.954 --> 00:18:25.213
You're the best crowd
I've ever had.

365
00:18:27.808 --> 00:18:29.725
And I love doing
stand-up comedy.

366
00:18:29.725 --> 00:18:34.834
Yeah. I love it! Yes. I do.<i>- (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</i>

367
00:18:34.834 --> 00:18:37.451
Did a show in the
Comedy Festival this year.

368
00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:39.292
Some people weren't
aware of it. apparently.

369
00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:41.576
I was out the front of my venue
one day

370
00:18:41.576 --> 00:18:42.826
and a bloke walked past
and said.

371
00:18:42.826 --> 00:18:46.632
"Oh. Hughesy. I love you.
What are you up to?"

372
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:50.060
I said.
"The Comedy Festival's on."

373
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.702
He said. "Oh. who you going
to see?"

374
00:18:57.457 --> 00:18:59.908
"I'm going to see Hughesy.
yeah?"

375
00:19:00.148 --> 00:19:03.398
"Oh. does he still...?"
"Yes. he fuckin' does!"

376
00:19:03.567 --> 00:19:05.692
He does it and he loves it.

377
00:19:05.692 --> 00:19:07.234
Absolutely love it. I do.

378
00:19:07.234 --> 00:19:09.221
I'm bloody pumped up
and I love comedy.

379
00:19:09.221 --> 00:19:10.751
I bloody love it. guys.

380
00:19:10.751 --> 00:19:14.109
I love it more than anything.
This is my joy.

381
00:19:14.109 --> 00:19:17.012
Get to leave the house
and have a good time.

382
00:19:17.012 --> 00:19:20.441
Have a good time with people. yeah?

383
00:19:20.441 --> 00:19:22.958
And you can get a photo with me
afterwards. if you like.

384
00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.859
-<i>
- Just get a photo.</i>

385
00:19:24.859 --> 00:19:27.899
I'm into it. I'm right into it.
I'm right into photos.

386
00:19:27.899 --> 00:19:30.692
But don't do what
this bloke did recently.

387
00:19:30.692 --> 00:19:32.435
He said. "Can I have a photo?"
I said. "Sure."

388
00:19:32.435 --> 00:19:33.952
I went to put my arm
around him.

389
00:19:33.952 --> 00:19:35.295
He said.
"No. just on your own."

390
00:19:39.175 --> 00:19:40.517
Well. that's weird.

391
00:19:40.517 --> 00:19:42.433
You could get one of those off
the internet. if you wanted to.

392
00:19:44.859 --> 00:19:46.776
And he said.
"Can you look angry?"

393
00:19:46.776 --> 00:19:48.454
I said. "I fuckin' am angry!"

394
00:19:50.484 --> 00:19:53.317
He said. "Can you put
your finger up to the camera?"

395
00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:54.426
"What?"

396
00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:56.243
He said. "Give the camera
the bird."

397
00:19:56.442 --> 00:19:57.776
So I said. "OK."

398
00:19:57.776 --> 00:20:02.051
He said. "Look really angry."
I said. "OK. Urgh."

399
00:20:02.051 --> 00:20:03.644
I said. "Why am I doing this?"

400
00:20:03.644 --> 00:20:05.981
He said. "I'm gonna send it
to my mate. He hates you."

401
00:20:14.225 --> 00:20:17.163
It was unnecessary.
Stop hating people.

402
00:20:17.429 --> 00:20:18.701
Some people don't like me

403
00:20:18.701 --> 00:20:21.029
'cause during the lockdown
I was on the internet

404
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:23.958
and I was just expressing
my opinions.

405
00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:26.184
I thought some of the
politicians were going too far.

406
00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:27.433
I'm not gonna lie.

407
00:20:27.433 --> 00:20:29.058
I thought
they were going too far.

408
00:20:29.058 --> 00:20:31.709
I thought they enjoyed
the press conferences too much.

409
00:20:32.005 --> 00:20:33.630
I thought Dan Andrews
in Victoria

410
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.192
was really going for it.

411
00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:37.859
Most locked down bloody city
in the world.

412
00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:39.234
It was a bit much.

413
00:20:39.329 --> 00:20:41.517
Remember when after two years
of being locked down

414
00:20:41.517 --> 00:20:44.182
we all got triple
or quadruple vaccinated.

415
00:20:44.492 --> 00:20:47.075
'cause you just never know
when enough's enough. do ya?

416
00:20:47.514 --> 00:20:49.890
I got vaccinated once
when I went for a jog.

417
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.600
I was jogging in St Kilda

418
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.150
and some bloke out the front
of a caravan said.

419
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.592
"Do you want your booster?"

420
00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:00.549
I said. "I'm going for a jog."

421
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.023
He said. "I've got one more to
give away before I can go home.

422
00:21:03.023 --> 00:21:04.632
"Come on!"

423
00:21:04.978 --> 00:21:06.852
So I jogged into his caravan.

424
00:21:06.852 --> 00:21:09.042
I said. "I don't have
my Medicare card."

425
00:21:09.042 --> 00:21:10.900
He said. "Doesn't matter."

426
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.025
He just stuck it in
and I jogged home.

427
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.709
I have no idea what
he put in me.

428
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.401
But after two years...
And I remember when Dan.

429
00:21:25.401 --> 00:21:26.652
after two years of
being locked down.

430
00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:29.532
Dan went on TV and said.
"I feel like a proud dad today.

431
00:21:29.532 --> 00:21:31.765
"You can come out."<i>- </i>

432
00:21:31.765 --> 00:21:33.625
That's weird.

433
00:21:33.777 --> 00:21:36.900
Proud dad 'cause you've locked
your kids in the basement

434
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.792
for two years?<i>- </i>

435
00:21:39.112 --> 00:21:41.667
Is that how Fritzl felt
when his kids got out?

436
00:21:47.824 --> 00:21:50.267
Alright. Is that a bit much?
Whatever!

437
00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:54.429
Every state premier
was doing it. weren't they?

438
00:21:54.429 --> 00:21:56.776
Oh. my God.
they were all insane.

439
00:21:57.109 --> 00:21:59.427
I actually didn't mind
the New South Wales Premier.

440
00:21:59.427 --> 00:22:02.000
She was letting people get out
and about. Gladys.

441
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.983
I didn't mind Gladys
and then Gladys had to quit.

442
00:22:05.184 --> 00:22:06.726
I thought.
"Why's she quitting

443
00:22:06.726 --> 00:22:09.141
"'cause she's in a relationship
with a guy called Daryl?"

444
00:22:09.651 --> 00:22:12.729
What. you quit being premier
'cause of a bloke called Daryl?

445
00:22:12.944 --> 00:22:15.277
I thought.
"He must be a looker."

446
00:22:15.277 --> 00:22:17.676
Then I saw a photo of Daryl.

447
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:20.584
Jeez. he must have a massive
Wagga Wagga. that Daryl.

448
00:22:22.818 --> 00:22:26.317
He must have a huge
Wagga Wagga.

449
00:22:26.704 --> 00:22:28.287
But they were all
gettin' involved.

450
00:22:28.287 --> 00:22:29.452
I didn't even know

451
00:22:29.452 --> 00:22:31.310
the Northern Territory
had someone in charge...

452
00:22:32.917 --> 00:22:34.284
...but they were going.

453
00:22:34.284 --> 00:22:36.051
"There's no-one who's got COVID
in the Territory."

454
00:22:36.051 --> 00:22:38.160
That's 'cause there's no
people there. mate!

455
00:22:38.652 --> 00:22:40.878
Test the crocodiles.
you'll find some.

456
00:22:41.844 --> 00:22:43.991
The WA guy was the winner
for me. though. wasn't he?

457
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:46.309
He was unbelievable.
He was so strict.

458
00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:48.793
I mean. Kim Jong-un was looking
at him going. "Mate..."

459
00:22:53.084 --> 00:22:55.209
"You need to calm down
a bit. mate."

460
00:22:58.018 --> 00:23:01.438
He was so addicted
to bloody publicity.

461
00:23:01.438 --> 00:23:04.167
And. for me. one of
the best stories of 2021

462
00:23:04.167 --> 00:23:06.542
was little Cleo.
the girl who got abducted.

463
00:23:06.542 --> 00:23:08.958
she was found
safe and well. thankfully.

464
00:23:08.958 --> 00:23:12.317
For 19 days. she was abducted.
eventually found.

465
00:23:12.317 --> 00:23:14.771
It was a guy who was obsessed
with Bratz dolls

466
00:23:14.884 --> 00:23:17.277
in a town called Carnarvon.

467
00:23:17.517 --> 00:23:19.851
And what happened?
The day she was found

468
00:23:19.851 --> 00:23:23.542
the WA Premier flew
to that town

469
00:23:23.542 --> 00:23:26.723
to do a meet-and-greet
with a four-year-old.

470
00:23:26.945 --> 00:23:29.403
Mate. she does not know
who you are.

471
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:32.150
She's not gonna vote for ya.
Fuck off.

472
00:23:33.907 --> 00:23:36.328
And she was with a guy who was
obsessed with Bratz dolls

473
00:23:36.328 --> 00:23:39.567
for 19 days. The Premier
gave her a teddy bear.

474
00:23:39.864 --> 00:23:41.196
I could see the look
in her eyes.

475
00:23:41.196 --> 00:23:42.189
She's looking at Mum going.

476
00:23:42.189 --> 00:23:44.173
"Do I have to go with
this fuckhead now. Mum?"

477
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:51.853
It was too much!

478
00:23:52.609 --> 00:23:54.026
Anyway. it's great to be here

479
00:23:54.026 --> 00:23:55.433
and you are the best crowd
I've ever had.

480
00:23:56.911 --> 00:23:58.626
I've never been more pumped up.

481
00:23:58.626 --> 00:24:01.317
-<i></i>
- And I am...

482
00:24:01.447 --> 00:24:03.488
-<i>
- I love it.</i>

483
00:24:03.488 --> 00:24:06.036
I love doing comedy.
I absolutely...

484
00:24:06.036 --> 00:24:07.600
I love hanging out
with new comedians.

485
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.292
They come up with terms
I don't know.

486
00:24:09.609 --> 00:24:11.401
I was backstage
at a little club recently.

487
00:24:11.401 --> 00:24:13.655
there was a bloke on stage
and he said... he said.

488
00:24:13.655 --> 00:24:15.734
"My girlfriend pegged me
last night."

489
00:24:17.183 --> 00:24:19.834
I had no idea
that was a new term.

490
00:24:19.834 --> 00:24:22.250
I thought 'pegging' was when
you put a clothes peg

491
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.109
on the back of someone's shirt.

492
00:24:24.109 --> 00:24:26.543
I was on next after this guy.

493
00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:28.804
I walked on stage and said.
"Who cares?

494
00:24:28.804 --> 00:24:30.626
"My kids peg me all the time."

495
00:24:33.963 --> 00:24:36.822
Then I found out
what it means now

496
00:24:36.822 --> 00:24:38.264
and that you...

497
00:24:38.264 --> 00:24:40.107
Do you know
what that means. sir?

498
00:24:40.107 --> 00:24:41.501
Do you know what 'pegging'
means?

499
00:24:41.501 --> 00:24:43.151
No. No. No. No.

500
00:24:43.151 --> 00:24:44.683
Yep. alright.

501
00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:46.143
Do you know what it means. mate?

502
00:24:46.143 --> 00:24:47.418
Have you heard the term?
<i>Yeah.</i>

503
00:24:47.418 --> 00:24:49.441
Yeah. absolutely. Yeah.<i>- </i>

504
00:24:50.487 --> 00:24:51.728
If you haven't heard that term.

505
00:24:51.728 --> 00:24:54.211
do not Google that at work
on Monday. I can tell you.

506
00:24:55.471 --> 00:24:58.600
It's... Oh. it's when a lady
loves a man a lot. apparently.

507
00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.917
It's good.

508
00:24:59.917 --> 00:25:02.401
It's good? Alright.<i>- </i>

509
00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:08.433
I'm not doing it.
'cause I think my wife.

510
00:25:08.433 --> 00:25:10.183
sometimes she might get
so angry that...

511
00:25:10.183 --> 00:25:11.958
Anyway. ah...<i>- </i>

512
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.517
Honestly. I'm not...

513
00:25:13.517 --> 00:25:15.584
Anyway. I...

514
00:25:17.484 --> 00:25:20.859
She made me have a colonic one
day and that was enough for me.

515
00:25:21.014 --> 00:25:23.306
I had no idea
what that process was.

516
00:25:23.306 --> 00:25:25.874
If you don't know what
that is - I had to go somewhere

517
00:25:25.874 --> 00:25:29.234
and a woman tried to shove
a garden hose up my arse.

518
00:25:30.524 --> 00:25:32.455
And the problem is
it wouldn't fit!

519
00:25:33.083 --> 00:25:35.613
That was the toughest
ten minutes of my life!

520
00:25:36.106 --> 00:25:39.930
We recorded it for the radio
and the playback was harrowing.

521
00:25:40.363 --> 00:25:43.488
It's was just me
going. "Aaaargh!"

522
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:44.917
Then I asked a question

523
00:25:44.917 --> 00:25:47.818
I never wanna have to
ask again in my life.

524
00:25:47.818 --> 00:25:52.067
I said. "Is it in yet?"<i>- </i>

525
00:25:52.067 --> 00:25:54.306
And the answer broke my heart.

526
00:25:55.165 --> 00:25:57.008
She said. "No. it's not."

527
00:25:57.301 --> 00:25:58.884
Oh. my God!

528
00:25:59.105 --> 00:26:00.981
Then she said something
that freaked me out.

529
00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:03.417
She said. "We might have to use
the kids' hose on you."

530
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.714
There's a kids' hose?

531
00:26:07.623 --> 00:26:09.183
Then my ego kicked in.

532
00:26:09.183 --> 00:26:12.167
I said. "I'm a man. You get
that man hose up me!"

533
00:26:14.352 --> 00:26:16.518
"Use a run-up
if you have to."

534
00:26:18.501 --> 00:26:21.109
"Get the receptionist
involved."

535
00:26:25.438 --> 00:26:27.062
Anyway.
No. it's great to be here.

536
00:26:27.062 --> 00:26:31.000
- It is great to be here.

537
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.157
I did recently start vaping.
which is ridiculous.

538
00:26:34.288 --> 00:26:37.834
I'm not proud of it.
It's stupid. It's stupid.

539
00:26:37.834 --> 00:26:39.469
Someone gave me one
on election night

540
00:26:39.469 --> 00:26:41.107
and I sucked on it

541
00:26:41.107 --> 00:26:43.007
and I'm... and it's...<i>- (CACKLING LAUGHTER)</i>

542
00:26:43.007 --> 00:26:44.957
It's not funny!<i>- </i>

543
00:26:45.275 --> 00:26:48.067
<i>I gave up smoking 30 years ago.</i>

544
00:26:48.209 --> 00:26:50.501
Now I'm sucking
on a highlighter. basically.

545
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:53.911
And they're talking about

546
00:26:53.911 --> 00:26:55.559
teenagers hiding it
from their parents.

547
00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:57.998
What about parents hiding it
from their teenagers?

548
00:26:58.814 --> 00:27:00.181
I rang my wife.

549
00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:01.424
She was in the car
with the three kids

550
00:27:01.424 --> 00:27:03.084
and I had a fresh vape
and I...

551
00:27:03.084 --> 00:27:05.899
It's in Alfoil
so they couldn't see me.

552
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.834
So I opened the packet.
my wife's eagle-eared.

553
00:27:08.834 --> 00:27:11.148
She said.
"What are you opening?"

554
00:27:11.317 --> 00:27:13.650
I said. "A packet of nuts."

555
00:27:14.037 --> 00:27:16.552
My son said. "What sorta nuts?"

556
00:27:17.234 --> 00:27:19.651
I said. "Blueberry ice nuts."

557
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:21.983
I'm just trying to hide it
from them.

558
00:27:22.074 --> 00:27:25.767
but she's found out and that's
tricky 'cause she's now...

559
00:27:25.767 --> 00:27:27.196
She rang me the other day
and she said.

560
00:27:27.196 --> 00:27:32.180
"I've googled and vaping causes
erectile dysfunction."

561
00:27:32.376 --> 00:27:35.084
I'm like. "Honey. don't make me
choose!"

562
00:27:37.333 --> 00:27:40.167
"This is available to me
every day.

563
00:27:40.504 --> 00:27:42.816
"That happens on my birthdays."

564
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.643
Yeah. I don't do any drugs
apart... I'm not a drug-taker.

565
00:27:47.643 --> 00:27:48.793
I'm not. I'm not.

566
00:27:48.793 --> 00:27:51.234
Now. who here's on
crystal meth? Who's on it. ah?

567
00:27:51.234 --> 00:27:52.842
<i>Yay!</i>

568
00:27:53.024 --> 00:27:55.233
There are only two more sleeps
till Christmas. you'll be OK.

569
00:27:55.233 --> 00:27:57.258
but. ah...

570
00:27:57.605 --> 00:27:59.938
That gets a bad rap. that drug.
but fair enough too.

571
00:27:59.938 --> 00:28:01.666
But I tell you what.
it does do some things.

572
00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:03.722
It gets people out
in the community. doesn't it?

573
00:28:03.722 --> 00:28:07.082
- They don't stay home.

574
00:28:07.376 --> 00:28:10.516
They like to integrate themselves.

575
00:28:10.748 --> 00:28:12.206
And they're not paranoid.

576
00:28:12.206 --> 00:28:14.356
They look in the mirror and go.
"I look good. yep.

577
00:28:14.701 --> 00:28:18.159
"I'm trying to eat me own
teeth. fuckin' fair enough.

578
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.651
"Let's go shopping at Big W."

579
00:28:24.709 --> 00:28:27.000
They interact with me.
these people. though.

580
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.818
because they see me
and they see a kindred spirit

581
00:28:28.818 --> 00:28:30.344
and I appreciate that.

582
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.682
Actually. I was on
the light rail recently.

583
00:28:32.682 --> 00:28:34.359
This is a true story. and this
is when you had to wear a mask

584
00:28:34.359 --> 00:28:35.798
and I'm not sure
if you still do.

585
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:38.534
but anyway. I was wearing
a mask. got on at St Kilda.

586
00:28:38.534 --> 00:28:39.926
There was no-one else
on the carriage.

587
00:28:39.926 --> 00:28:41.319
I thought. "I'll get into
the city. no worries.

588
00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:45.008
"I'm wearing my mask." Some bloke got
on after me. no-one else in the carriage.

589
00:28:45.008 --> 00:28:48.212
and straight away I could tell
that he was a meth enthusiast.

590
00:28:48.452 --> 00:28:49.990
You just know.

591
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.891
And where did he decide to sit?

592
00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:53.999
Right beside me.<i>- </i>

593
00:28:53.999 --> 00:28:56.566
And he started staring at me.

594
00:28:56.566 --> 00:29:00.799
I'm trying not to freak out
and then he goes. "Hughesy!"

595
00:29:02.629 --> 00:29:04.644
"You're trying to hide
behind that mask

596
00:29:04.644 --> 00:29:07.336
"but I can see you!"

597
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.873
- "I'm not hiding. mate.

598
00:29:09.873 --> 00:29:12.671
"I'm not Michael Jackson
in 1987.

599
00:29:13.107 --> 00:29:15.455
"It's a government regulation!"

600
00:29:15.455 --> 00:29:17.612
He said. "Well. I'm not
wearing one."

601
00:29:17.612 --> 00:29:21.054
I said. "I reckon COVID's the
least of your problems. mate."

602
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:25.575
Then. I kid you not. he said.

603
00:29:25.575 --> 00:29:27.225
"You wanna know
what I've been up to today?"

604
00:29:27.225 --> 00:29:30.333
And I'm thinking.
"No. I don't."

605
00:29:30.475 --> 00:29:32.559
He said. "OK. I'll tell ya."

606
00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:36.444
And this is true. he said.
"I stabbed two blokes."

607
00:29:36.444 --> 00:29:40.427
I'm like. "Oo-oh!
Well. you've had a full day.

608
00:29:40.826 --> 00:29:42.826
"You have a good old sleep

609
00:29:42.826 --> 00:29:45.100
"and you start stabbing again
in the morning. alright?"

610
00:29:47.918 --> 00:29:52.109
So then he must've felt guilty.
He said. "They deserved it."

611
00:29:52.309 --> 00:29:55.976
I said. "I'm sure they did.
mate. I am Team Stabby!"

612
00:29:55.976 --> 00:29:59.183
"You stab because you care."

613
00:30:00.505 --> 00:30:02.839
Then he said. "They were
trying to steal me drugs."

614
00:30:02.839 --> 00:30:05.947
I said. "Well. clearly.
they failed in that endeavour."

615
00:30:08.096 --> 00:30:10.872
But then he goes.
"What have you been up to?"

616
00:30:10.872 --> 00:30:13.565
and I thought. "Oh. no.
I've gotta step this up."

617
00:30:13.851 --> 00:30:17.934
"I've gotta let this guy know
that I'm a hard man."

618
00:30:17.934 --> 00:30:21.142
I said. "Mate. I've been
on the edge today. as well.

619
00:30:21.142 --> 00:30:23.960
"The law means nothing to me.

620
00:30:24.099 --> 00:30:26.642
"I didn't even tap on
for this ride."

621
00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:33.981
"We're both going to hell
and we're going there for free.

622
00:30:34.142 --> 00:30:37.767
"If a ticket inspector gets on.
you know what to do."

623
00:30:45.059 --> 00:30:46.976
Anyway. if he's watching this

624
00:30:46.976 --> 00:30:48.709
I said I wouldn't tell anyone.
but I have.

625
00:30:48.709 --> 00:30:50.567
Ah...<i>- </i>

626
00:30:52.603 --> 00:30:53.895
There's no inhibitions.

627
00:30:53.895 --> 00:30:55.962
I was in a city car park
one night. alright.

628
00:30:55.962 --> 00:30:57.589
and I'm walking back to my car.

629
00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:59.322
It was a Saturday night.
about 11 o'clock.

630
00:30:59.434 --> 00:31:02.910
and I walked past a guy who was
lying on top of a sleeping bag.

631
00:31:03.153 --> 00:31:04.612
I thought. "Hang on.
he's got no shirt on.

632
00:31:04.612 --> 00:31:06.970
"Hang on. he's got
no clothes on whatsoever."

633
00:31:07.225 --> 00:31:11.267
He was holding an iPad
and he was doing something

634
00:31:11.267 --> 00:31:13.776
he should not have been
doing in public.

635
00:31:13.776 --> 00:31:15.801
It was graphic.

636
00:31:15.899 --> 00:31:18.399
He was on his own.
but I still felt like a victim.

637
00:31:20.167 --> 00:31:21.625
I went back to my car
and I thought.

638
00:31:21.625 --> 00:31:24.066
"You know what.
I'm normally live or let live.

639
00:31:24.188 --> 00:31:25.937
"but I've just walked past
a crime

640
00:31:25.937 --> 00:31:27.712
"and I'm gonna phone
this one in."

641
00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:31.318
So I got my phone out.
I'm standing next to my car

642
00:31:31.318 --> 00:31:33.909
and I was thinking about
ringing triple zero

643
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:35.754
and becoming
a triple-zero hero.

644
00:31:36.117 --> 00:31:38.034
Then I thought about
what are they gonna ask me?

645
00:31:38.034 --> 00:31:40.480
Am I gonna have to describe
what's going on here?

646
00:31:40.801 --> 00:31:44.176
Gonna have to pick out a penis
in a line-up.

647
00:31:46.653 --> 00:31:49.612
What if this makes the news
and the headline is.

648
00:31:49.612 --> 00:31:51.804
"Dave Hughes helps police
out with their enquiries

649
00:31:51.804 --> 00:31:54.039
"about masturbating man
in car park"?

650
00:31:55.063 --> 00:31:58.778
I thought. "That's not right.
I don't wanna be that guy."

651
00:31:59.043 --> 00:32:00.210
So then I'm standing there

652
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:03.360
and someone else must've made
the phone call before I did

653
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.798
so five police walked up
the ramp of the city car park

654
00:32:06.892 --> 00:32:08.434
to deal with the wanker.

655
00:32:10.042 --> 00:32:11.754
They walked over and gave him
a bit of a kick. like.

656
00:32:11.754 --> 00:32:12.754
"Put it away. mate. alright?"

657
00:32:12.754 --> 00:32:17.152
And then two of them looked up
and saw me. 30 metres away.

658
00:32:17.434 --> 00:32:20.350
standing there. phone in hand.

659
00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:26.232
They came over. he said.

660
00:32:26.232 --> 00:32:28.056
"Are you the guy that made
the call?"

661
00:32:28.056 --> 00:32:31.088
I said. "Nah.
I was just watching."

662
00:32:38.652 --> 00:32:40.235
Anyway. no.
it's great to be here

663
00:32:40.235 --> 00:32:41.721
and I am so pumped up.

664
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:43.204
You are the best crowd
I've ever had.

665
00:32:43.204 --> 00:32:45.062
-<i></i>
- Thank you.

666
00:32:45.062 --> 00:32:46.212
-<i></i>
- Thank you.

667
00:32:46.447 --> 00:32:48.447
Spending a lot of time
in Sydney at the moment.

668
00:32:48.447 --> 00:32:50.838
Everyone loves Sydney. yeah?<i>- (AUDIENCE BOOS)</i>

669
00:32:50.838 --> 00:32:52.364
Whatever.

670
00:32:54.048 --> 00:32:56.256
Tell you what is different.
the beaches.

671
00:32:56.387 --> 00:32:58.303
I'm a Melbourne beach guy.

672
00:32:58.303 --> 00:33:01.077
I can sorta get away with my
body on a Melbourne beach.

673
00:33:03.684 --> 00:33:05.726
- Thank you.

674
00:33:05.726 --> 00:33:07.644
That gets a cheer here.

675
00:33:07.951 --> 00:33:09.161
My children don't cheer it.

676
00:33:09.161 --> 00:33:11.404
I'm not allowed to have
my shirt off at home!

677
00:33:11.938 --> 00:33:14.398
The other day. my nine-year-old
said. "Dad. you've got boobs."

678
00:33:14.398 --> 00:33:16.256
I said. "You haven't.
so who's the winner?"

679
00:33:19.867 --> 00:33:22.367
On a Sydney beach
I can't get away with it.

680
00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:23.701
They're so fit.

681
00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:25.952
Even in winter. they're ripped.

682
00:33:25.952 --> 00:33:28.812
I'm like. "Fuckin' have a donut
and calm down. you fuckheads."

683
00:33:30.044 --> 00:33:31.736
It's winter!

684
00:33:31.736 --> 00:33:34.300
I was eating chips on
the Bondi Beach recently

685
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.700
and the seagulls were looking
at me going.

686
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.391
"What the fuck are they?"

687
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:41.720
"We only have kale here."

688
00:33:45.481 --> 00:33:46.940
Anyway. no.
it's great to be here.

689
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:48.798
But it's been so cold.
hasn't it?

690
00:33:49.034 --> 00:33:50.200
<i>Yes.</i>

691
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.018
ScoMo was right.
It's not easy under Albanese.

692
00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:59.201
Who would've thought that
advertising campaign

693
00:33:59.201 --> 00:34:00.436
wasn't gonna work?

694
00:34:00.896 --> 00:34:03.897
They spent hundreds of millions
of dollars on that thing.

695
00:34:03.897 --> 00:34:05.429
Got 'em nowhere.

696
00:34:05.967 --> 00:34:07.342
Poor old ScoMo.

697
00:34:07.342 --> 00:34:09.867
I mean. he was...
I mean. he tri-...

698
00:34:09.867 --> 00:34:11.934
Anyway. poor old ScoMo!

699
00:34:12.061 --> 00:34:13.728
I knew he wasn't
cutting through

700
00:34:13.728 --> 00:34:18.659
when he gave Joe Biden
$100 billion for submarines.

701
00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:19.746
He was meant to give them
to the French.

702
00:34:19.746 --> 00:34:22.207
but he took it off the French
and he gave it to Joe Biden

703
00:34:22.207 --> 00:34:24.418
'cause he wanted to
suck up to Joe Biden.

704
00:34:24.621 --> 00:34:25.785
And Joe Biden.

705
00:34:25.785 --> 00:34:28.419
at a press conference with
Boris Johnson and ScoMo.

706
00:34:28.419 --> 00:34:31.591
just two people. only had to
remember two names.

707
00:34:32.238 --> 00:34:33.988
Joe Biden said.
"Thank you. Boris."

708
00:34:33.988 --> 00:34:37.388
and looked at ScoMo
and said. "Aaaah.

709
00:34:37.535 --> 00:34:40.082
"Thanks to the dude
from Down Under."

710
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.151
$100 billion and he can't even
remember his name.

711
00:34:44.267 --> 00:34:47.475
I mean. that says a little bit
about Joe Biden. as well.

712
00:34:47.582 --> 00:34:49.665
I don't know if you've
looked at him recently.

713
00:34:49.665 --> 00:34:52.356
but that is Weekend At Bernie's
style.

714
00:34:55.475 --> 00:34:58.435
Come on. I saw him fall off
a pushbike the other day.

715
00:34:58.762 --> 00:35:00.138
He is struggling.

716
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.449
But I get in trouble
when I mention Joe Biden.

717
00:35:02.559 --> 00:35:05.059
Actually. I had to get
off Twitter after this.

718
00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:08.598
I said something about Joe
Biden which angered everyone.

719
00:35:08.802 --> 00:35:11.794
Joe Biden was doing a speech.
right. and I was watching it

720
00:35:11.794 --> 00:35:13.152
and he was struggling
with his speech.

721
00:35:13.152 --> 00:35:14.966
there's no doubt about it.

722
00:35:15.534 --> 00:35:18.659
So I wrote. "Joe Biden's having
a mad struggle with his speech.

723
00:35:18.659 --> 00:35:20.183
"Is it the autocue?"

724
00:35:20.183 --> 00:35:21.708
And I thought it might've been

725
00:35:21.708 --> 00:35:23.678
because I struggle
with autocues as well.

726
00:35:23.853 --> 00:35:25.770
I've been on TV
for over 20 years.

727
00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.536
they never let me
use the autocue

728
00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:29.807
because. apparently.
every time I use it.

729
00:35:29.807 --> 00:35:31.621
it looks like I'm in
a hostage situation.

730
00:35:34.183 --> 00:35:36.976
So I wrote that tweet
thinking no-one would care.

731
00:35:36.976 --> 00:35:38.501
I wrote it and I sent it.

732
00:35:38.501 --> 00:35:40.401
I left my phone
for ten minutes.

733
00:35:40.401 --> 00:35:44.410
I came back and. apparently.
I had started World War Three.

734
00:35:44.948 --> 00:35:47.276
I was trending number one.
two and three.

735
00:35:47.276 --> 00:35:49.342
and none of the comments
were positive.

736
00:35:49.342 --> 00:35:51.534
People were hating on me.

737
00:35:51.534 --> 00:35:53.392
It was unbelievable.

738
00:35:53.392 --> 00:35:55.354
The first comment
was from Wendy Harmer.

739
00:35:55.354 --> 00:35:56.434
a great Australian comedian.

740
00:35:56.434 --> 00:35:59.638
She wrote. "Hughesy.
Joe Biden's got a stutter.

741
00:35:59.638 --> 00:36:01.205
"You should know that."

742
00:36:01.205 --> 00:36:03.574
Well. I fuckin' didn't know it. Wendy.

743
00:36:05.111 --> 00:36:07.069
Did you know Joe Biden
had a stutter?

744
00:36:07.175 --> 00:36:09.384
No. 'cause he doesn't stutter.

745
00:36:09.493 --> 00:36:10.946
Apparently.
he did when he was a kid.

746
00:36:10.946 --> 00:36:13.263
but that was in the 1800s.
for fuck's sake!

747
00:36:15.385 --> 00:36:17.682
For three days.
people were hating on me.

748
00:36:17.682 --> 00:36:19.165
It was unbelievable!

749
00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.629
The worst comment I got
was when someone wrote.

750
00:36:21.719 --> 00:36:23.552
"Hughesy. I used to
find you funny.

751
00:36:23.552 --> 00:36:26.619
"but I'm never gonna laugh at
anything you ever say again

752
00:36:26.619 --> 00:36:28.659
"because now
you've punched down."

753
00:36:29.181 --> 00:36:31.389
I had no idea what that meant.

754
00:36:31.496 --> 00:36:32.621
I had to look it up.

755
00:36:32.621 --> 00:36:33.730
It means you're having a go

756
00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.169
at someone of a lower
social status than you.

757
00:36:37.917 --> 00:36:40.126
Joe Biden's the President
of America!

758
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.782
I hang out with crackheads
on the light rail.

759
00:36:51.318 --> 00:36:53.652
It was unbelievable.
But anyway.

760
00:36:53.782 --> 00:36:55.824
Good on him
and good luck to him. alright?

761
00:36:55.955 --> 00:36:57.955
Hope it works out for him.

762
00:36:58.075 --> 00:37:00.035
I put a photo up
of my rescue dog.

763
00:37:00.035 --> 00:37:01.769
trying to suck up to people.

764
00:37:01.769 --> 00:37:03.903
- Anyone got a rescue animal?
<i>Woo!</i>

765
00:37:04.216 --> 00:37:05.925
We're the real heroes.
aren't we?

766
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.434
<i>Yes.</i>
- Yes.

767
00:37:07.434 --> 00:37:09.107
I mean. there's all these
people with Cavoodles

768
00:37:09.107 --> 00:37:10.299
living easy lives.

769
00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.350
They don't know what it's
like to really love an animal

770
00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.920
'cause one thing you know about
rescue dogs when you get 'em.

771
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.707
you know there's
something wrong.

772
00:37:20.148 --> 00:37:22.590
They're not giving away
the good ones. I can tell you.

773
00:37:25.774 --> 00:37:28.440
We got two new rescue cats.
We already had a rescue...

774
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.261
We had two rescue dogs
and a rescue cat.

775
00:37:30.261 --> 00:37:32.870
We got two new rescue cats
during lockdown.

776
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:34.687
That's a big effort.

777
00:37:34.687 --> 00:37:36.712
- One of them got run over.
<i>Ohhh!</i>

778
00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:39.456
Yeah. it's sad.
but that was during a lockdown

779
00:37:39.456 --> 00:37:41.773
when there was
no cars on the street.

780
00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:44.642
I don't know how it found a car
to run itself over.

781
00:37:45.976 --> 00:37:47.684
Was it a suicide?

782
00:37:49.434 --> 00:37:51.492
It might've been our first
rescue cat

783
00:37:51.492 --> 00:37:53.985
who did not like the new cats.
at all.

784
00:37:53.985 --> 00:37:56.113
Teddy. who's 18 years old.

785
00:37:56.392 --> 00:37:59.684
He's been morbidly obese
for that whole time.

786
00:37:59.826 --> 00:38:01.659
I've had vets over 18 years say.

787
00:38:01.659 --> 00:38:02.976
"You've got to get him
to lose weight."

788
00:38:02.976 --> 00:38:04.767
"Do I. mate?
I don't think so."

789
00:38:04.767 --> 00:38:07.517
- He's happy.

790
00:38:07.517 --> 00:38:09.517
"He doesn't even have an
Instagram account. alright.

791
00:38:09.517 --> 00:38:12.626
"so there's no-one
trolling his selfies."

792
00:38:12.626 --> 00:38:15.151
He goes. "You're overfeeding
him." "No. I'm not.

793
00:38:15.151 --> 00:38:17.486
"He might have a Deliveroo
account. as far as I know."

794
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:23.309
But morbidly obese Teddy
is still hunting.

795
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:24.414
Still hunting!

796
00:38:24.414 --> 00:38:25.852
I saw him out in the backyard
the other day

797
00:38:25.852 --> 00:38:27.794
with a pigeon in his mouth.

798
00:38:27.794 --> 00:38:30.444
Not for a second did
I feel sorry for that pigeon.

799
00:38:30.767 --> 00:38:33.350
I thought. "If you're an animal
with the gift of flight

800
00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:35.309
"and you got caught
by that fat fucker..."

801
00:38:37.793 --> 00:38:40.151
"..you deserve to die!"

802
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.350
No. we love... We love Teddy.
We do.

803
00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:48.458
I've got two rescue dogs
as well.

804
00:38:48.458 --> 00:38:51.442
Barkley I've had for 17 years.

805
00:38:51.642 --> 00:38:52.726
17 years!

806
00:38:52.726 --> 00:38:55.960
He's a mid-size mongrel
and for all that time.

807
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.500
he has been biting people.

808
00:38:58.183 --> 00:38:59.550
And that is an achievement.

809
00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.293
to keep a dog alive for
that long that bites people.

810
00:39:02.427 --> 00:39:04.636
You know how many crimes
I've had to cover up?

811
00:39:07.367 --> 00:39:10.652
He's never hurt anyone
that bad. but it's stressful.

812
00:39:11.029 --> 00:39:14.113
I remember one day I was
in a park and he bit a kid.

813
00:39:14.273 --> 00:39:15.726
Luckily. the kid wasn't
old enough

814
00:39:15.726 --> 00:39:17.793
to explain to his mum
what had happened.

815
00:39:20.193 --> 00:39:21.694
The kid was about two.

816
00:39:21.694 --> 00:39:23.135
And he didn't even break
the skin.

817
00:39:23.135 --> 00:39:25.628
but the kid's carrying on like
he'd been bitten by a shark.

818
00:39:26.326 --> 00:39:28.284
I'm. "You're OK. mate.
You're OK."

819
00:39:28.284 --> 00:39:30.215
She's on her iPhone.
she didn't see what happened.

820
00:39:30.502 --> 00:39:32.377
I'm like. "What can we do?
Do you want some cash?

821
00:39:32.377 --> 00:39:33.819
"Let's shut up. mate."

822
00:39:36.151 --> 00:39:38.318
Eventually. his mum
looked off her iPhone and said.

823
00:39:38.318 --> 00:39:39.259
"What happened here?"

824
00:39:39.259 --> 00:39:42.846
I said. "Your kid just went
nuts. Can you calm him down?

825
00:39:42.846 --> 00:39:44.078
"He's freaking my dog out."

826
00:39:47.837 --> 00:39:50.420
Some people...
Some people deserve it. though.

827
00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.737
I tell people not to pat him.

828
00:39:51.863 --> 00:39:53.029
One woman. one day.

829
00:39:53.029 --> 00:39:55.284
she had dreadlocks
and she went to pat him.

830
00:39:55.284 --> 00:39:56.976
I said. "Don't pat him."
She said. "Why?"

831
00:39:56.976 --> 00:39:58.251
I said. "He will bite you."

832
00:39:58.251 --> 00:39:59.776
She said. "He won't."
I said. "He will."

833
00:39:59.776 --> 00:40:01.676
She said. "He won't.
I'm a dog whisperer."

834
00:40:01.676 --> 00:40:03.895
I said. "Well. guess what.
I can see the future..."

835
00:40:05.212 --> 00:40:08.195
"..and I reckon my superpower's
gonna beat your superpower."

836
00:40:08.512 --> 00:40:11.428
She said. "Watch this."
and I watched my dog bite her.

837
00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:16.169
She looked at me
like I hadn't predicted it.

838
00:40:17.128 --> 00:40:20.067
"Oh. Nostradamus has got
another right over here. yeah?

839
00:40:20.407 --> 00:40:22.198
"You're a dog whisperer
and he's deaf.

840
00:40:22.198 --> 00:40:23.514
"he couldn't fuckin' hear you!"

841
00:40:25.575 --> 00:40:27.742
"He smelt the dreadlocks
and he went for the kill!"

842
00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.452
No. I love Barkley.
We got some tough news.

843
00:40:33.452 --> 00:40:34.993
No. I do love Barkley.

844
00:40:34.993 --> 00:40:37.697
He's a great dog and I walk him
round all the time

845
00:40:37.697 --> 00:40:39.722
and you know what he loves.
he loves to poo in public.

846
00:40:39.722 --> 00:40:41.392
And he won't just do one.

847
00:40:41.392 --> 00:40:43.826
He'll do. like. nine or ten
on every walk.

848
00:40:43.826 --> 00:40:45.701
I reckon he counts the amount
of bags I've got

849
00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:47.100
and makes sure he does
one more shit

850
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.668
than the amount of bags
I've got.

851
00:40:48.668 --> 00:40:51.359
And he always does the last one
in front of people.

852
00:40:51.359 --> 00:40:54.074
He did one in front
of a cake shop one day

853
00:40:54.074 --> 00:40:55.392
and I'd run out of bags.

854
00:40:55.392 --> 00:40:57.267
People were eating
their bloody mudcakes.

855
00:40:59.183 --> 00:41:00.684
I'm like. "You want
another one?"

856
00:41:02.292 --> 00:41:03.525
I had no bags left.

857
00:41:03.525 --> 00:41:05.073
All I could find was
a McDonald's cup

858
00:41:05.073 --> 00:41:07.073
so I scooped the shit in that

859
00:41:07.559 --> 00:41:10.099
and it was a big cup.
and it needed to be.

860
00:41:10.099 --> 00:41:12.091
I'm walking home
with my stupid dog

861
00:41:12.091 --> 00:41:14.575
and a massive cup of shit...<i></i>

862
00:41:14.575 --> 00:41:17.139
...thinking. "I've worked too
hard to be in this situation."

863
00:41:17.762 --> 00:41:19.441
Normally. I love
getting recognised.

864
00:41:19.441 --> 00:41:21.424
but this wasn't
one of those times.

865
00:41:21.684 --> 00:41:26.225
Two young women said.
"Hughesy. we need a photo."

866
00:41:26.225 --> 00:41:28.695
and I'm thinking.
"No. you don't. Not today."

867
00:41:29.216 --> 00:41:30.925
They wouldn't take
no for an answer.

868
00:41:30.925 --> 00:41:33.403
I had one under this arm.
one under this arm.

869
00:41:33.403 --> 00:41:34.365
She's trying to work out

870
00:41:34.365 --> 00:41:35.973
the reverse bloody camera
on her iPhone

871
00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:38.141
while I had a cup of shit
in her ear.

872
00:41:40.976 --> 00:41:43.897
Eventually. the smell
overpowered the three of us.

873
00:41:45.074 --> 00:41:47.074
She said. "What's in the cup?"

874
00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:51.959
I said. "That's McDonald's
new thickshake."

875
00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.402
Anyway.

876
00:41:57.402 --> 00:42:00.094
No. you're a great crowd.
I've never been more pumped up.

877
00:42:00.963 --> 00:42:03.074
Had some tough news
with Barkley. though.

878
00:42:03.074 --> 00:42:05.052
recently. though.
Barkley. 17-year-old Barkley.

879
00:42:05.052 --> 00:42:08.169
Took him to the vet and
the vet gave him the once-over.

880
00:42:08.326 --> 00:42:10.409
I'll never forget what the vet
said. it was only recently.

881
00:42:10.409 --> 00:42:12.726
He said. "I reckon he's got
about five more years

882
00:42:12.726 --> 00:42:14.016
"left in him."

883
00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:18.409
"Are you sure?"

884
00:42:22.854 --> 00:42:24.604
No. we love Barkley.

885
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.382
but Barkley looks at me

886
00:42:26.382 --> 00:42:28.365
the way the Queen looks at
Prince Charles.

887
00:42:29.973 --> 00:42:31.873
"I'm never gonna fuckin' die!"

888
00:42:35.475 --> 00:42:37.767
He's trying to knock her off.
isn't he. yeah?

889
00:42:37.767 --> 00:42:40.333
He gave her COVID.
He had it seven times.

890
00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:42.400
Every time. he took it
straight home to Mummy.

891
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.175
"Come on. Mummy.
let's have a kiss."

892
00:42:45.635 --> 00:42:47.702
"Tongues tonight. Mummy."

893
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:52.815
Anyway. no. you're...
This is...

894
00:42:52.815 --> 00:42:55.506
I'm pumped up.
You're a great crowd.

895
00:42:56.717 --> 00:42:58.383
My children maybe
will see this.

896
00:42:58.483 --> 00:42:59.988
Maybe they will. I don't know.

897
00:42:59.988 --> 00:43:02.177
I'll tell you what the best
thing about the pandemic was.

898
00:43:02.177 --> 00:43:04.327
My daughter's ballet concerts
were cancelled for two years.

899
00:43:07.793 --> 00:43:09.607
No. honestly.

900
00:43:09.607 --> 00:43:11.298
They lock the doors
when they start.

901
00:43:11.298 --> 00:43:12.947
It's like a hostage situation.

902
00:43:14.284 --> 00:43:15.762
You can't just watch your kid
and leave.

903
00:43:15.762 --> 00:43:17.613
you've gotta watch everyone.

904
00:43:17.788 --> 00:43:20.911
My nine-year-old had her
first concert recently.

905
00:43:20.911 --> 00:43:23.228
She was crying all
the way through it.

906
00:43:23.576 --> 00:43:25.409
Afterwards. I said.
"What was wrong?"

907
00:43:25.409 --> 00:43:27.434
She said.
"I made a mistake. Dad."

908
00:43:27.434 --> 00:43:29.251
I said. "Who cares?

909
00:43:29.426 --> 00:43:31.340
"The whole thing
looks like a fuckin' mistake."

910
00:43:35.141 --> 00:43:37.433
No. I support...
I do support them.

911
00:43:37.433 --> 00:43:39.637
I mean. I try to get them
involved in my career.

912
00:43:39.637 --> 00:43:41.078
They couldn't give a shit.

913
00:43:41.078 --> 00:43:44.149
Recently. I was on Celebrity
Gogglebox with my children.

914
00:43:44.149 --> 00:43:45.800
Anyone see that?
<i>Yeah!</i>

915
00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:48.456
Yeah. thank you. alright.
Thank you for watching.

916
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:50.318
And my two daughters
were there.

917
00:43:50.318 --> 00:43:51.514
My son didn't want to do it.

918
00:43:51.514 --> 00:43:52.617
Alright. whatever. mate.

919
00:43:52.617 --> 00:43:53.774
But they're there

920
00:43:53.774 --> 00:43:55.853
and. honestly. five minutes
into watching it...

921
00:43:55.853 --> 00:43:57.838
If you don't know
what Gogglebox is.

922
00:43:57.977 --> 00:44:00.810
you watch TV. people film you
while you're watching it.

923
00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.503
and that's TV. apparently.

924
00:44:03.736 --> 00:44:05.595
They didn't like the shows
we were watching.

925
00:44:05.686 --> 00:44:07.849
At that time. Married At First
Sight was one of the shows

926
00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:09.625
and my daughter was going.
"This is weird. Dad.

927
00:44:09.625 --> 00:44:11.693
"Those people aren't
meant for each other.

928
00:44:12.053 --> 00:44:13.428
"Why are they married?"

929
00:44:13.543 --> 00:44:15.751
I said. "'Cause the experts
put them together."

930
00:44:16.143 --> 00:44:18.517
- "But they're not suited."
- "I know they're not suited

931
00:44:18.517 --> 00:44:20.867
"and the experts know as well.
alright. so...

932
00:44:20.867 --> 00:44:23.260
"They want two crazy people to
hang out for a couple of months

933
00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.327
"and that's it. alright?"

934
00:44:24.327 --> 00:44:25.625
I wouldn't trust those experts

935
00:44:25.625 --> 00:44:28.691
to match my socks.
to be honest. so...

936
00:44:29.005 --> 00:44:31.005
After five minutes of watching
the show. they're going.

937
00:44:31.005 --> 00:44:32.313
"We don't wanna be here
anymore."

938
00:44:32.313 --> 00:44:34.130
"You've got to.
We've got to do this."

939
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.451
"We know our rights."

940
00:44:35.451 --> 00:44:37.643
What?<i>- </i>

941
00:44:38.032 --> 00:44:39.698
Then they stopped smiling.

942
00:44:39.698 --> 00:44:41.158
I said. "Keep smiling!

943
00:44:41.158 --> 00:44:42.572
"Australia needs to know

944
00:44:42.572 --> 00:44:44.284
"we're a happy fuckin'
family. alright?"

945
00:44:48.214 --> 00:44:51.006
My son. I take him out
to bloody basketball

946
00:44:51.006 --> 00:44:52.139
every Friday night.

947
00:44:52.139 --> 00:44:53.945
He plays in the Under.
what is it.

948
00:44:53.945 --> 00:44:56.554
the Under-something.
ah. Under-14s.

949
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.867
We drive for an hour.
hour-and-a-half.

950
00:44:58.867 --> 00:45:01.501
every Friday night and
the gratitude? There's none.

951
00:45:01.687 --> 00:45:03.478
He's on his TikTok
the whole way.

952
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.581
Drove to Bacchus Marsh recently.

953
00:45:05.581 --> 00:45:06.834
got there and he goes.

954
00:45:06.834 --> 00:45:08.652
"Just drop me off out
the front. you find a park."

955
00:45:10.545 --> 00:45:12.128
"You're not LeBron James.
mate."

956
00:45:15.642 --> 00:45:17.976
He said. "See ya.
wouldn't wanna be ya."

957
00:45:17.976 --> 00:45:21.059
I said. "I think you would.
'cause I've got the car. yeah?"

958
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.367
"It's a lot of dribbling to get
back to St Kilda. fuckhead.

959
00:45:26.367 --> 00:45:27.726
"I can tell you."

960
00:45:33.707 --> 00:45:35.081
No. he's a good kid.

961
00:45:35.081 --> 00:45:37.341
No. he bloody annoys me. though.

962
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:38.824
He does annoy me.

963
00:45:38.824 --> 00:45:41.270
The other night. his wi-...
Not his wife. my wife!

964
00:45:44.128 --> 00:45:46.236
His mother hugged me
in the kitchen

965
00:45:46.236 --> 00:45:48.095
and he was.
"Oh. this is disgusting.

966
00:45:48.392 --> 00:45:49.806
"Get a room!"

967
00:45:49.965 --> 00:45:51.511
I said. "We've got
a whole house!

968
00:45:51.511 --> 00:45:53.286
"You don't own fuck all. mate.
alright. so..."

969
00:45:56.449 --> 00:45:57.605
"And her hugging me

970
00:45:57.605 --> 00:45:59.520
"is the reason
you're in the world. yeah?

971
00:45:59.813 --> 00:46:03.730
"If she didn't wanna do this.
you would be alive. yeah?

972
00:46:03.855 --> 00:46:05.188
"You're like someone
who likes bacon.

973
00:46:05.188 --> 00:46:07.181
"doesn't wanna see the pig get
slaughtered. aren't ya?"

974
00:46:08.243 --> 00:46:09.479
My wife said. "Am I the pig?"

975
00:46:09.479 --> 00:46:11.331
"No. you're not the pig
in the analogy!"

976
00:46:14.533 --> 00:46:17.075
No. I do. I love my...

977
00:46:17.075 --> 00:46:19.200
My children are amazing
and my wife is amazing.

978
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.726
She's an absolute angel.
no doubt about it. absolutely.

979
00:46:21.726 --> 00:46:23.751
And I think...
I think I'm a good guy.

980
00:46:23.751 --> 00:46:25.735
I think. generally.
I'm a good guy.

981
00:46:25.992 --> 00:46:27.367
I mean. I do things wrong.

982
00:46:27.367 --> 00:46:29.962
I'm a sober guy. I come home
early every night.

983
00:46:29.962 --> 00:46:31.695
but. you know.
but I'm not perfect

984
00:46:31.809 --> 00:46:33.225
and I found that out recently.

985
00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:34.484
I'm lying in bed.

986
00:46:34.484 --> 00:46:36.117
I've started reading a Kindle
to go to sleep.

987
00:46:36.117 --> 00:46:38.681
It's an eReader. You don't
need the bedside light on.

988
00:46:38.681 --> 00:46:40.289
So I read it every night
to go to sleep.

989
00:46:40.289 --> 00:46:41.595
thinking I'm doing
the right thing.

990
00:46:41.595 --> 00:46:44.465
Reading me Kindle the other
night and she just snapped.

991
00:46:44.705 --> 00:46:46.829
She said. "You're ruining
my life!"

992
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.175
I'm like. "Can I just finish
my chapter

993
00:46:49.175 --> 00:46:50.442
"before we go on with that?"

994
00:46:50.442 --> 00:46:52.482
She said. "That's why you're
ruining my life."

995
00:46:52.482 --> 00:46:53.997
I said. "What do you mean

996
00:46:53.997 --> 00:46:55.498
"that's why I'm ruining
your life?"

997
00:46:55.709 --> 00:46:57.459
She said. "It's that Kindle.
You're addicted to it."

998
00:46:58.329 --> 00:47:01.746
"Well. you've lucked out in the
husband stakes. haven't ya?"

999
00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.130
"You could have a
heroin-addicted. womanising.

1000
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.694
"gambling addict
who's out every night.

1001
00:47:07.886 --> 00:47:11.678
"but you've got yourself a
dirty. stinking Kindle reader."

1002
00:47:13.851 --> 00:47:18.142
"Some arsehole who comes home
early every night

1003
00:47:18.142 --> 00:47:21.529
"and lies in bed
just to fuck you up!"

1004
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:26.944
I said. "How is this ruining
your life?"

1005
00:47:26.944 --> 00:47:28.649
She said. "It's so bright.

1006
00:47:28.649 --> 00:47:32.299
"I can't sleep when you read it
and you read it every night."

1007
00:47:32.429 --> 00:47:35.054
I'm like. "It's not a flare.
for fuck's sake!"

1008
00:47:36.352 --> 00:47:38.197
"Can't you shut your eyes?"

1009
00:47:38.941 --> 00:47:41.946
She said. "I can see it
through my shut eyelids."

1010
00:47:42.348 --> 00:47:45.014
"Well. get some thicker
eyelids. you fuckhead!"

1011
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:50.099
Now guys.
before you cancel me.

1012
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:54.409
not all of that story
happened out loud.

1013
00:47:57.434 --> 00:48:00.066
Her half did happen out loud.

1014
00:48:00.175 --> 00:48:02.800
My half was
an internal monologue.

1015
00:48:05.244 --> 00:48:08.284
So when she said. ah. you know.
that I was ruining her life.

1016
00:48:08.284 --> 00:48:10.144
I said. "How?"
she said. "The Kindle."

1017
00:48:10.144 --> 00:48:13.153
I said. "I'm sorry."
I said. "What's the problem?"

1018
00:48:13.153 --> 00:48:14.653
She said. "It's too bright."

1019
00:48:14.653 --> 00:48:16.138
and I said.
"I didn't know. honey!"

1020
00:48:17.926 --> 00:48:19.474
"What do we do?"

1021
00:48:19.474 --> 00:48:21.791
She said. "You can
turn it down."

1022
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:24.238
and together
we turned it down so low.

1023
00:48:24.367 --> 00:48:26.617
that I could no longer read it.

1024
00:48:28.793 --> 00:48:30.593
I couldn't tell her that. though.

1025
00:48:30.784 --> 00:48:33.713
She went straight to sleep and
I just dropped it on the ground

1026
00:48:34.068 --> 00:48:36.444
and stared at the ceiling
for six hours...

1027
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:39.788
...wondering what heroin
was like.

1028
00:48:45.614 --> 00:48:47.447
No. we are a great couple.
though. We are.

1029
00:48:47.447 --> 00:48:49.081
And I've got to say this
about couples

1030
00:48:49.081 --> 00:48:50.066
in long-term relationships.

1031
00:48:50.066 --> 00:48:52.755
We're 20 years down the track.
20 years together.

1032
00:48:52.755 --> 00:48:54.822
It's a good effort. yeah?
20 years!

1033
00:48:57.763 --> 00:49:01.413
And we still have sexy times.
yes!

1034
00:49:01.871 --> 00:49:03.912
Often.<i>- </i>

1035
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:06.276
You've gotta
keep having sexy times.

1036
00:49:06.276 --> 00:49:07.877
You have to.

1037
00:49:07.877 --> 00:49:10.486
I know that you get tired.
but you've gotta push through.

1038
00:49:12.477 --> 00:49:14.086
There's a lot of women
in this room going.

1039
00:49:14.086 --> 00:49:15.570
"But I work so hard."

1040
00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:18.595
I know you do and that's why
we want to reward you.

1041
00:49:22.668 --> 00:49:25.543
My wife works very hard.
there's no doubt about it.

1042
00:49:25.543 --> 00:49:27.927
She takes the mental load
of the family

1043
00:49:27.927 --> 00:49:29.614
and I appreciate that.

1044
00:49:29.614 --> 00:49:31.930
Not enough. apparently.
but I do.

1045
00:49:32.185 --> 00:49:33.435
But I tell you what.

1046
00:49:33.435 --> 00:49:36.627
her multitasking can become inappropriate.

1047
00:49:36.992 --> 00:49:38.851
Recently. we were in the middle
of what I thought

1048
00:49:38.851 --> 00:49:40.446
was a very sexy time.

1049
00:49:40.446 --> 00:49:41.967
I thought we were
in the middle of it.

1050
00:49:41.967 --> 00:49:43.909
I thought we were focused.

1051
00:49:44.228 --> 00:49:47.186
Then she goes. "Mmmmmm.

1052
00:49:47.186 --> 00:49:49.650
"What are we gonna get
Sidney for his birthday?"

1053
00:49:51.157 --> 00:49:53.282
Sidney's our seven-ear-old
nephew.

1054
00:49:53.631 --> 00:49:56.256
I had my hand
on her tit at the time.

1055
00:49:58.434 --> 00:50:00.532
I'm like. "Honey. I don't care.

1056
00:50:00.532 --> 00:50:02.889
"Let's talk about this
afterwards."

1057
00:50:03.255 --> 00:50:05.672
There's no way... There is
a double standard. guys.

1058
00:50:05.672 --> 00:50:07.572
There's no way.
even after 20 years.

1059
00:50:07.572 --> 00:50:11.266
I could change the subject
during the middle of sexy time

1060
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.540
if she was busting
her best moves.

1061
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.624
There is no way.

1062
00:50:15.624 --> 00:50:17.897
I mean. imagine...
No. don't imagine.

1063
00:50:20.157 --> 00:50:24.672
Just say she was going down
on meee!

1064
00:50:25.068 --> 00:50:28.235
So let's just imagine
it's 2005!

1065
00:50:31.563 --> 00:50:34.648
Then I tap her
on the top of the head.

1066
00:50:35.026 --> 00:50:37.652
"Mmmm. it's going very well.

1067
00:50:37.652 --> 00:50:40.219
"but what are we gonna get
Sidney for his birthday?"

1068
00:50:42.598 --> 00:50:44.723
She would bite my cock off!

1069
00:50:47.608 --> 00:50:50.858
And not a court in the land
would convict her!

1070
00:50:55.165 --> 00:50:57.832
There's definitely
a double standard.

1071
00:50:57.832 --> 00:51:00.458
absolutely. definitely.

1072
00:51:00.685 --> 00:51:03.306
I remember just before
the pandemic hit.

1073
00:51:03.306 --> 00:51:05.310
she went to Bali
on a girls' trip.

1074
00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:07.614
One of her friends
was turning 40.

1075
00:51:07.992 --> 00:51:10.450
And I'm like. "Right. I'll stay
home with the three kids."

1076
00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:12.809
They complained the whole time
she was away.

1077
00:51:12.809 --> 00:51:15.042
"Where's Mum?
When will she be back?"

1078
00:51:15.042 --> 00:51:16.280
I knew that was gonna happen.

1079
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.211
They complain
if she goes to the shops.

1080
00:51:18.314 --> 00:51:21.064
"When will Mum be back?"
"I reckon five minutes.

1081
00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.118
"You wanna FaceTime her.
do you?"

1082
00:51:23.868 --> 00:51:25.409
I can go away for three weeks.

1083
00:51:25.409 --> 00:51:27.598
they don't even
look up from their iPads.

1084
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:31.348
I once rang them
from Montreal. FaceTime.

1085
00:51:31.348 --> 00:51:34.489
I reckon I was a minute
into the conversation.

1086
00:51:34.489 --> 00:51:36.556
my son said.
"Dad. gonna put you down now."

1087
00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:39.475
and just dropped the phone.
left me staring at the ceiling.

1088
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.817
No-one came to check on me.

1089
00:51:44.175 --> 00:51:45.784
I just hung up.

1090
00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:47.924
Made me think about
50 years' time

1091
00:51:47.924 --> 00:51:50.717
where I'm lying in a nursing
home bed. they're looking over.

1092
00:51:50.717 --> 00:51:52.367
"We're gonna put you down now.
Dad."

1093
00:51:54.059 --> 00:51:55.857
"It's been fun. but it's over."

1094
00:51:56.968 --> 00:51:59.259
Anyway. so she's over in Bali.

1095
00:51:59.259 --> 00:52:01.143
This is the double standard.
I get a text message.

1096
00:52:01.143 --> 00:52:03.501
I reckon it was midnight
on a Wednesday night.

1097
00:52:03.501 --> 00:52:04.819
This is what the message said.

1098
00:52:04.819 --> 00:52:07.269
"Me and the girls are going
for late night massages.

1099
00:52:07.269 --> 00:52:08.761
"Wish us luck."

1100
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:10.345
"Wish us luck."

1101
00:52:10.345 --> 00:52:12.953
After-midnight
massages in Bali.

1102
00:52:13.404 --> 00:52:15.521
I can tell you. if I'm on
a boys' trip to Bali.

1103
00:52:15.521 --> 00:52:17.254
I'm not sending that message.

1104
00:52:19.934 --> 00:52:21.142
"Wish us luck. honey.

1105
00:52:21.142 --> 00:52:23.127
"Wanna have a happy
ending to the evening!"

1106
00:52:23.792 --> 00:52:25.482
Anyway. so I said. "Good luck"

1107
00:52:25.482 --> 00:52:26.923
and then I woke up
the next morning

1108
00:52:26.923 --> 00:52:30.948
to a photo from her -
it was of her decolletage

1109
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.290
with scratches
over the top of her boobs.

1110
00:52:33.443 --> 00:52:35.110
I'm like.
"What. she's sexting me?"

1111
00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:37.412
I sent a message.
"What happened last night?"

1112
00:52:37.504 --> 00:52:39.587
She sent a message back.
"You a bit suss on me. are ya?"

1113
00:52:39.851 --> 00:52:42.383
- "Well. yes. I am.

1114
00:52:42.383 --> 00:52:44.522
"They're pretty
scratchy boobs!"

1115
00:52:44.769 --> 00:52:47.102
She sent a message back.
"That's cute. isn't it?"

1116
00:52:47.102 --> 00:52:48.711
That's cute?

1117
00:52:48.711 --> 00:52:51.319
I don't reckon it'd be cute if
you were suss on me. would ya?

1118
00:52:51.566 --> 00:52:52.899
If you thought
I'd cheated on you.

1119
00:52:52.899 --> 00:52:55.090
it'd be light rail stabby.
stabby guy. wouldn't it?

1120
00:52:58.285 --> 00:52:59.925
Then she sent a message back saying.

1121
00:52:59.925 --> 00:53:02.659
"I was so relaxed
after the massage.

1122
00:53:02.659 --> 00:53:04.892
"walking back to the villa
I didn't look where I was going

1123
00:53:04.892 --> 00:53:06.751
"and I stepped into a ditch."

1124
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.392
I'm like. "Was there a tiger
in that ditch. was there?"

1125
00:53:10.767 --> 00:53:14.142
"'Cause they are very.
very scratchy boobs."

1126
00:53:14.545 --> 00:53:16.832
Then she said something
I will never forget.

1127
00:53:16.966 --> 00:53:20.050
She said. "I can't even
cheat on you in my fantasies."

1128
00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:21.472
I'm like. "What?

1129
00:53:21.664 --> 00:53:23.265
"20 years together

1130
00:53:23.265 --> 00:53:25.833
"and you've never thought
about another man?"

1131
00:53:25.982 --> 00:53:27.442
And she said. "Yes. I have."

1132
00:53:27.909 --> 00:53:29.642
I said. "Well. isn't
that cheating on me

1133
00:53:29.642 --> 00:53:30.596
"in your fantasies?"

1134
00:53:30.596 --> 00:53:33.956
She said. "No. First. I have to
fantasise that you've died."

1135
00:53:37.664 --> 00:53:39.163
I'm like. "Every time?

1136
00:53:39.163 --> 00:53:41.336
"And can you not use the term
'fantasising'

1137
00:53:41.336 --> 00:53:42.759
"when you talk
about me dying?"

1138
00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:45.684
She said. "Every time."
I said. "Well. how do I die?"

1139
00:53:45.684 --> 00:53:47.475
She said.
"All sorts of different ways."

1140
00:53:52.029 --> 00:53:53.818
I said. "Do I ever suffer?"

1141
00:53:53.818 --> 00:53:57.051
She said.
"Sometimes you suffer a lot."

1142
00:53:57.051 --> 00:53:59.240
"Well done. good on you for
being able to get through that

1143
00:53:59.407 --> 00:54:01.141
"and get on with your life."

1144
00:54:01.417 --> 00:54:02.753
Now it makes me wonder
what she thinks...

1145
00:54:02.753 --> 00:54:04.195
Anyway. whatever. good on her.

1146
00:54:04.909 --> 00:54:06.659
We're a great couple and
we have a great time together.

1147
00:54:06.659 --> 00:54:08.100
We're a beautiful couple.

1148
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.498
And we do. We... we...
Good on us.

1149
00:54:10.632 --> 00:54:11.640
It's not easy. though.

1150
00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.164
when you've got children
in the house. you know?

1151
00:54:13.164 --> 00:54:14.315
It's not easy.

1152
00:54:14.315 --> 00:54:16.631
And my wife has got
an open-door policy. yeah?

1153
00:54:17.066 --> 00:54:19.317
So the door always has to be
open to our bedroom.

1154
00:54:19.517 --> 00:54:21.809
She says she wants
everyone to feel safe.

1155
00:54:21.809 --> 00:54:23.726
I'm like. "If they see
what's happening right now.

1156
00:54:23.726 --> 00:54:25.684
"they're not gonna feel safe.
I don't believe."

1157
00:54:27.392 --> 00:54:29.976
That can be really.
really stressful

1158
00:54:29.976 --> 00:54:31.626
if you're in the middle of it.

1159
00:54:31.626 --> 00:54:32.943
Really stressful.

1160
00:54:33.159 --> 00:54:34.682
I remember one night.
we're in the middle of it

1161
00:54:34.682 --> 00:54:38.164
and my son starts running
down the corridor to our room.

1162
00:54:38.617 --> 00:54:41.909
He's going faster than
Usain Bolt at the Olympics.

1163
00:54:41.909 --> 00:54:44.633
He's sprinting towards us
and he's going.

1164
00:54:44.633 --> 00:54:47.742
"There's really scary noises
going on in there!

1165
00:54:47.742 --> 00:54:50.225
"The noises
are freaking me out!"

1166
00:54:50.225 --> 00:54:52.809
We have not got
time to uncouple.

1167
00:54:52.809 --> 00:54:55.156
I'm like. "Well.
run away from the noise!"

1168
00:54:56.515 --> 00:54:59.016
"Why would you run
towards danger?"

1169
00:54:59.145 --> 00:55:02.020
He said. "Dad.
but the noises are scary!"

1170
00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.754
I said. "Go to the backyard!"

1171
00:55:04.878 --> 00:55:07.107
"We'll come out
when it's safe!"

1172
00:55:07.505 --> 00:55:09.714
He said. "Dad.
but I wanna come in there."

1173
00:55:09.714 --> 00:55:11.075
I'm like. "If you come in here.

1174
00:55:11.075 --> 00:55:13.851
"I won't be coming anywhere.
will I?"

1175
00:55:16.684 --> 00:55:19.217
And my wife is like.
"You've gotta let him in."

1176
00:55:19.217 --> 00:55:20.890
I said. "I don't want to!

1177
00:55:21.617 --> 00:55:23.742
"It's my birthday!"

1178
00:55:27.647 --> 00:55:31.483
But she says. "Oh. alright."
and we uncoupled

1179
00:55:32.025 --> 00:55:35.358
and he walked in. he said.
"Is it safe in here now?"

1180
00:55:35.358 --> 00:55:37.923
I said. "Yes. it's safe
in here."

1181
00:55:37.923 --> 00:55:40.615
He said.
"No more scary noises?"

1182
00:55:40.718 --> 00:55:43.635
I said. "No more scary noises.

1183
00:55:43.892 --> 00:55:46.642
"You might hear a noise in the
bathroom in a minute. though."

1184
00:55:48.333 --> 00:55:50.317
"Don't worry about that."

1185
00:55:50.317 --> 00:55:51.551
He said. "What will that be?"

1186
00:55:51.551 --> 00:55:54.326
I said. "That'll be Dad hitting
his dick with a hammer."

1187
00:55:59.483 --> 00:56:03.441
Guys. you have been
the best crowd I've ever had.

1188
00:56:03.586 --> 00:56:06.086
I bloody love you!<i>- </i>

1189
00:56:06.086 --> 00:56:08.570
And who loves
the Masked Singer?

1190
00:56:10.436 --> 00:56:12.478
If you don't know what
the Masked Singer is.

1191
00:56:12.478 --> 00:56:13.705
it's a TV show.

1192
00:56:13.705 --> 00:56:14.979
I'm on it.

1193
00:56:15.076 --> 00:56:18.826
Yes. you have singers in masks
and they sing.

1194
00:56:18.826 --> 00:56:22.227
I sit on a panel
and we guess who they are.

1195
00:56:22.407 --> 00:56:24.365
And it's not easy to guess.

1196
00:56:24.559 --> 00:56:26.017
It can be stressful.

1197
00:56:26.123 --> 00:56:27.582
Really stressful.

1198
00:56:27.582 --> 00:56:29.031
And sometimes the mask
comes off

1199
00:56:29.031 --> 00:56:30.557
and you've gotta keep guessing.

1200
00:56:37.977 --> 00:56:40.805
And if you don't hear Osher
say who it is.

1201
00:56:40.805 --> 00:56:43.412
I'm like. "Who the fuck
did he say?"

1202
00:56:43.412 --> 00:56:45.225
You've gotta be excited about
people you don't know.

1203
00:56:45.225 --> 00:56:47.365
"Oh. no. it's you!

1204
00:56:47.365 --> 00:56:49.474
"I can't believe it's you!

1205
00:56:49.659 --> 00:56:51.617
"I can't believe you'd do
this show

1206
00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:53.892
"'cause I don't know
who the fuck you are!"

1207
00:56:56.744 --> 00:56:58.744
I initially did the show.

1208
00:56:58.744 --> 00:57:00.237
I didn't know
what the show was.

1209
00:57:00.237 --> 00:57:03.074
but I heard I was gonna be with
Dannii Minogue. Jackie O

1210
00:57:03.074 --> 00:57:06.301
and Lindsay Lohan.
and I thought. "And me?"

1211
00:57:06.301 --> 00:57:09.326
And they said. "Yep."
I said. "Well. count me in."

1212
00:57:09.587 --> 00:57:12.879
Lindsay Lohan.
an international star!

1213
00:57:13.005 --> 00:57:15.379
She was famous as a child.
world-famous.

1214
00:57:15.379 --> 00:57:17.029
She did a movie called
Parent Trap

1215
00:57:17.139 --> 00:57:19.807
and then she did a movie called
Freaky Friday

1216
00:57:19.807 --> 00:57:21.290
and then she was a teenager.

1217
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:23.524
she did a movie called
Mean Girls.

1218
00:57:23.524 --> 00:57:25.064
Massive star!

1219
00:57:25.064 --> 00:57:27.798
Then she made
a series of decisions...

1220
00:57:29.616 --> 00:57:31.115
...and it meant in 2019.

1221
00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:36.807
she flew to Australia to be on
a TV show sitting next to me.

1222
00:57:37.153 --> 00:57:38.736
And the first time she saw me.

1223
00:57:38.736 --> 00:57:40.969
I think she regretted
some of those decisions.

1224
00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:44.536
She couldn't even
understand me.

1225
00:57:44.642 --> 00:57:48.475
She looked at me and said.
"Why do you speak like that?"

1226
00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:50.933
I said. "It's a gift."

1227
00:57:54.285 --> 00:57:57.613
She got told there was gonna be
massive stars on the show.

1228
00:57:57.613 --> 00:57:59.715
She was... She was reaching
for the bloody...

1229
00:57:59.715 --> 00:58:02.365
One night she said.
"I think it's Bruno Mars."

1230
00:58:02.517 --> 00:58:05.684
My main job early on was
just to encourage her guessing.

1231
00:58:05.684 --> 00:58:08.251
I said. "I reckon it might be.

1232
00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:10.151
"He just won 20 Grammys.

1233
00:58:10.151 --> 00:58:12.426
"He's got $800 million
in the bank.

1234
00:58:12.636 --> 00:58:14.219
"This was gonna be
his next move.

1235
00:58:14.219 --> 00:58:15.661
"there's no doubt about it."

1236
00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:23.622
It wasn't Bruno Mars.

1237
00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:27.409
But I got to spend
the night in her hotel room

1238
00:58:27.668 --> 00:58:29.183
'cause a mate of mine.
another comedian.

1239
00:58:29.183 --> 00:58:31.184
was on the show one night.
Nazeem Hussain.

1240
00:58:31.184 --> 00:58:32.376
and she liked...

1241
00:58:32.376 --> 00:58:35.633
They got along well and she
sent him a message afterwards.

1242
00:58:35.633 --> 00:58:37.367
I was hanging out with him
at a hotel and he said.

1243
00:58:37.367 --> 00:58:39.767
"Lindsay Lohan wants us
to come to her hotel room."

1244
00:58:39.767 --> 00:58:41.674
I'm like. "What?"
He said. "Yeah."

1245
00:58:41.674 --> 00:58:44.740
I said. "Oh. my God! Really?"

1246
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:47.409
And then he sent a message back
and I didn't hear the response.

1247
00:58:47.409 --> 00:58:48.575
I said. "What did she say?"

1248
00:58:48.575 --> 00:58:49.881
"She hasn't responded
to my next message."

1249
00:58:49.881 --> 00:58:50.882
I said. "What was the message?"

1250
00:58:50.882 --> 00:58:54.448
He said. "I sent her a message.
'Should we bring a plate?'"

1251
00:58:55.097 --> 00:58:57.181
I'm like. "Mate. she doesn't
know what that is!

1252
00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:00.492
"She's not a housewife
from Melton. for fuck's sake."

1253
00:59:04.632 --> 00:59:09.257
She came back with the message.
"A plate?

1254
00:59:09.257 --> 00:59:10.989
"Bring a bottle of wine."

1255
00:59:11.079 --> 00:59:13.412
And then we started
freaking out

1256
00:59:13.412 --> 00:59:15.770
'cause I don't drink
and he's Muslim.

1257
00:59:19.099 --> 00:59:22.591
I said. "One of us
is going to hell tonight!"

1258
00:59:23.095 --> 00:59:25.262
We brought a bottle of wine.
none of us touched it.

1259
00:59:25.262 --> 00:59:26.454
She didn't notice.

1260
00:59:26.454 --> 00:59:27.955
But I was hanging out
in a hotel room

1261
00:59:27.955 --> 00:59:31.440
like I was Robert Downey Jr.
in 19-bloody-97.

1262
00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.006
I was freakin' out.

1263
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:35.277
I was so nervous. I went to
the toilet at one point

1264
00:59:35.277 --> 00:59:38.761
just to do a wee. but I got
stage fright in the toilet.

1265
00:59:38.949 --> 00:59:41.324
I'm like. "Oh. no!"
and the clock was ticking.

1266
00:59:41.324 --> 00:59:43.774
I'm thinking. "She's gonna
think I'm doing a shit."

1267
00:59:45.085 --> 00:59:47.402
Have you had a good time. everyone?

1268
00:59:47.402 --> 00:59:51.175
- I love you all.

1269
00:59:51.175 --> 00:59:53.075
I've been Dave Hughes.

1270
00:59:53.075 --> 00:59:55.100
Thank you!
