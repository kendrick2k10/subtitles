00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.619
- <i> Bringing you</i>
<i>Center Four...</i>

4
00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:26.424
- <i> The shadow that you seen</i>
<i>was bipedal.</i>

5
00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:29.955
<i>and it almost looked like a...</i>
<i>like a giant canine.</i>

6
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.926
<i>It didn't have any...you know.</i>
<i>human features to it.</i>

7
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.929
Seven. eight feet tall.
very broad-shouldered.

8
00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:38.601
and it had this...

9
00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:39.965
and it had this...

10
00:01:40.803 --> 00:01:42.033
canine-looking head.

11
00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:48.138
- <i> I remember</i>

12
00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:51.251
<i>it was a dog-like creature.</i>

13
00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:56.817
<i>To this day. I can distinctly</i>
<i>remember hearing the footsteps.</i>

14
00:01:56.852 --> 00:02:01.624
Bipedal footsteps on the gravel.
and it was shuffling.

15
00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:06.761
- <i> This thing</i>
<i>emerges from the corn.</i>

16
00:02:06.796 --> 00:02:08.796
<i>and it was about six feet tall.</i>

17
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:11.205
<i>it had the head of a dog.</i>

18
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.965
<i>high-pointed ears.</i>

19
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.210
<i>it's shoulders were...</i>
<i>were rolled. and it's arms</i>
<i>were long.</i>

20
00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:19.576
and I remember it just.
turned its head

21
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:21.006
like this and looked at me.

22
00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:30.917
- <i> I've faced</i>
<i>predators.</i>

23
00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:33.623
<i>Most of your big game predators</i>

24
00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:35.361
<i>that you have in the States.</i>

25
00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:36.824
These things don't act
like that.

26
00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.826
You look in these things' eyes.

27
00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:43.160
<i>these things look like they're</i>
<i>trying to figure you out.</i>

28
00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:44.667
<i>They look like they're looking</i>
<i>through you.</i>

29
00:02:44.702 --> 00:02:46.207
<i>trying to figure out what</i>
<i>your next move is.</i>

30
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:49.606
<i>So they can get around it.</i>

31
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:52.136
<i>I've been around predators</i>
<i>my whole life.</i>

32
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.512
<i>and I've never seen anything</i>
<i>in my life like that.</i>

33
00:04:30.038 --> 00:04:32.511
So the history of werewolf

34
00:04:32.546 --> 00:04:36.416
and Dogman sightings
is... is ancient.

35
00:04:36.451 --> 00:04:40.145
We have to look at the
Greek myths first.

36
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.587
uh. to come up with the
word "lycanthropy".

37
00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:48.285
- <i> And from</i>
<i>that time on.</i>

38
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.892
<i>we have now had</i>
<i>part of our vernacular</i>

39
00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:52.663
<i>the word "lycanthrope".</i>

40
00:04:52.698 --> 00:04:56.326
<i>And the Greeks were very aware</i>

41
00:04:56.361 --> 00:04:58.295
<i>that werewolves existed.</i>

42
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.506
<i>So when we look at the word</i>
<i>"werewolf" as well.</i>

43
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:01.738
<i>or you know the word "were"</i>

44
00:05:01.773 --> 00:05:04.334
<i>W-E-R. comes from</i>
<i>the Middle Ages.</i>

45
00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:06.039
<i>And it simply means. "man".</i>

46
00:05:06.074 --> 00:05:08.173
<i>So you have a man-wolf.</i>

47
00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:10.879
<i>We see also. even</i>
<i>in the Viking culture.</i>

48
00:05:10.914 --> 00:05:14.179
<i>you know. a few thousand</i>
<i>years later. 2000 years later.</i>

49
00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:17.116
<i>whenever they</i>
<i>would dress in the furs</i>

50
00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:19.954
<i>of particular animals</i>
<i>of which they wanted</i>
<i>to emulate.</i>

51
00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:24.354
<i>The name "Berserker" comes</i>
<i>from those that wore</i>
<i>bear hides.</i>

52
00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.666
<i>But also there were the Vikings</i>
<i>that wore the furs of a wolf.</i>

53
00:05:28.701 --> 00:05:30.833
<i>and they were called</i>
<i>the "drinkers of blood".</i>

54
00:05:30.868 --> 00:05:34.298
<i>Because they believed</i>
<i>that they were able to assume</i>

55
00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:39.006
<i>that animal's form. that</i>
<i>animal's ferocity in battle.</i>

56
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.012
<i>Sightings historically.</i>

57
00:05:45.047 --> 00:05:47.883
I think are often amalgamated
with Bigfoot sightings.
unfortunately.

58
00:05:47.918 --> 00:05:50.215
Because. we didn't really have

59
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.351
<i>the differential type of</i>
<i>comparison and contrast</i>
<i>with the Dogman.</i>

60
00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:56.056
<i>I think and just up</i>
<i>until recently.</i>

61
00:05:56.091 --> 00:05:58.894
<i>people were seeing what</i>
<i>they call "Dogman".</i>
<i>or. "werewolf."</i>

62
00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:02.359
<i>More. because now we have that</i>
<i>as part of our language.</i>

63
00:06:02.394 --> 00:06:04.438
<i>But I think a lot of times</i>
<i>when people were talking</i>

64
00:06:04.473 --> 00:06:07.034
about being confronted by
a Bigfoot.

65
00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.543
<i>or encountering a Bigfoot that</i>
<i>was acting aggressively.</i>

66
00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:13.205
<i>A lot of those reports</i>
<i>that I'm looking at.</i>

67
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.944
<i>I am now thinking.</i>
<i>are more in the realm</i>

68
00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.585
<i>of the Dogman. werewolf.</i>
<i>sightings than a typical</i>
<i>Bigfoot sighting.</i>

69
00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:24.524
It's always seemed like Dogman
is a bit aggressive in nature.

70
00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:26.988
because you hear so many stories
of people that see it.

71
00:06:27.023 --> 00:06:28.792
and it chases them out of
an area.

72
00:06:28.827 --> 00:06:30.464
or it bites them.

73
00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:33.830
There are multiple sightings
up from here in the region
where...

74
00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:35.634
- <i> people</i>
<i>just see it running across</i>
<i>the trail</i>

75
00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.769
<i>or it doesn't chase them.</i>
<i>you...you know. they'll</i>
<i>just see it.</i>

76
00:06:38.804 --> 00:06:40.298
<i>It's like every encounter</i>
<i>you hear</i>

77
00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.234
<i>that they're described</i>
<i>just a little bit different.</i>

78
00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:45.611
People say it looked like
the werewolf from the movie
<i>Silver Bullet.</i>

79
00:06:45.646 --> 00:06:47.437
<i>Or you'll hear somebody say.</i>

80
00:06:47.472 --> 00:06:49.274
<i>"Well. uh.</i>
<i>the legs and the arms</i>

81
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:50.781
<i>looked like a canine.</i>
<i>but it...</i>

82
00:06:50.816 --> 00:06:52.310
<i>stood up on two legs</i>

83
00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:55.280
<i>it kind of had a coyote head.</i>
<i>but it was much larger."</i>

84
00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:56.721
<i>So. it's a...</i>

85
00:06:56.756 --> 00:06:58.118
it's a little strange
in that way.

86
00:06:58.153 --> 00:06:59.559
you hear a lot of
different types.

87
00:06:59.594 --> 00:07:01.957
They all seem to differ.
in some little manner.

88
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.456
- <i> So anywhere</i>
<i>in the Midwest.</i>

89
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:08.458
I mean. it just makes
perfect sense.

90
00:07:08.493 --> 00:07:10.262
And there's...there's
a lot of cover.

91
00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:11.428
I mean. there's still...

92
00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:13.705
uh. in the Midwest and
Central America.

93
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.805
There's... North America.

94
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.334
- <i> there's a lot of...</i>

95
00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:19.238
<i>wide open spaces and a lot</i>
<i>of woods.</i>

96
00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:23.649
<i>And a lot of places where</i>
<i>a single person jogging down</i>
<i>a road.</i>

97
00:07:23.684 --> 00:07:26.344
<i>looks like a tasty. tasty meal.</i>

98
00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:27.653
<i>If that's...</i>

99
00:07:27.688 --> 00:07:29.248
<i>If that's what their intent is.</i>

100
00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:31.448
<i>or if their intent is...</i>

101
00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:33.318
<i>"Just stay away from</i>
<i>where we're guarding.</i>

102
00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:36.596
<i>We don't want you. you know.</i>
<i>we don't want you messing...</i>

103
00:07:36.631 --> 00:07:38.664
<i>with what... what we're</i>
<i>protecting."</i>

104
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.645
<i>Bucyrus. as I understand.</i>

105
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.472
<i>was founded in</i> <i> 1821.</i>

106
00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:59.652
<i>Uh. it was given</i>
<i>the name "Bucyrus".</i>
<i>by Colonel James Kilbourne.</i>

107
00:08:01.986 --> 00:08:04.184
<i>I don't know what his interest</i>
<i>was in Bucyrus.</i>

108
00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:07.825
<i>but. we're forever cursed</i>
<i>with a name. that nobody</i>
<i>could pronounce.</i>

109
00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:10.795
<i>Yeah. it's been around</i>
<i>a long time.</i>

110
00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:14.997
<i>Grew up here? Yep.</i>

111
00:08:15.032 --> 00:08:17.670
<i>North of town. out</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

112
00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:20.530
<i>It's a quiet... existence</i>
<i>growing up. because.</i>

113
00:08:20.565 --> 00:08:21.905
<i>because. I mean.</i>

114
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.171
<i>Bucyrus is a small town.</i>

115
00:08:24.206 --> 00:08:25.535
<i>But I grew up...</i>

116
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.878
<i>very rural... like nine miles</i>
<i>outside of town.</i>

117
00:08:32.687 --> 00:08:35.545
<i>So. you know. we visited</i>
<i>our grandparents in town.</i>

118
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.956
<i>and it was a nice Middle</i>
<i>America small town.</i>

119
00:08:39.991 --> 00:08:41.991
Leave It To Beaver<i> could have</i>
<i>been filmed...</i>

120
00:08:42.026 --> 00:08:43.894
<i>you know. on one</i>
<i>of the streets.</i>

121
00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:44.862
<i>Uh...</i>

122
00:08:44.897 --> 00:08:47.260
<i>Just a nice place to grow up.</i>

123
00:08:47.295 --> 00:08:49.900
- <i> People. you know.</i>
<i>the...the people here.</i>

124
00:08:49.935 --> 00:08:52.496
are pretty... down-to-earth
people.

125
00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:53.838
You know. we have. uh.

126
00:08:53.873 --> 00:08:56.434
essentially a makeup of people
who was born here.

127
00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:59.613
and a lot of people
that migrated from Kentucky.

128
00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:04.508
<i>As a kid.</i>

129
00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:06.950
<i>you know. my grandparents</i>
<i>would tell us</i>

130
00:09:06.985 --> 00:09:09.854
<i>stories about a creature that</i>

131
00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:13.253
<i>that they refer to</i>
<i>as the Bobo.</i>

132
00:09:13.288 --> 00:09:15.486
<i>Bobo...The other thing</i>
<i>I can figure. Bobo</i>

133
00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:17.191
<i>was some sort of...</i>

134
00:09:17.226 --> 00:09:21.459
<i>some sort of. you know.</i>
<i>bipedal... you know. hominid.</i>

135
00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.901
<i>And then they also told us</i>
<i>a story about a creature</i>

136
00:09:23.936 --> 00:09:26.299
<i>by the name of</i>
<i>Raw Head and Bloody Bones.</i>

137
00:09:26.334 --> 00:09:28.334
<i>Which. I had no idea</i>
<i>what that was.</i>

138
00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:31.711
<i>but I presumed it was some</i>
<i>version of the Boogeyman.</i>

139
00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:33.713
<i>And so years later. when</i>
<i>you have the Internet.</i>

140
00:09:33.748 --> 00:09:35.275
<i>I've... I've actually looked</i>
<i>it up.</i>

141
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.212
<i>and. uh. my grandmother</i>
<i>on my mother's side</i>

142
00:09:38.247 --> 00:09:40.786
<i>came from the Tennessee area.</i>

143
00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:42.414
<i>Uh. in North Carolina.</i>

144
00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:44.020
<i>in that mountainous area there.</i>

145
00:09:44.055 --> 00:09:46.253
<i>And it turns out that Raw</i>
<i>Head and Bloody Bones</i>

146
00:09:46.288 --> 00:09:49.795
<i>date all the way back</i>
<i>to 15th Century England.</i>

147
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.225
<i>And you know.</i>

148
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.227
<i>immigrants came over. and the</i>
<i>stories came over</i>

149
00:09:53.262 --> 00:09:55.966
<i>and over the years. "Be careful</i>
<i>going to the woods.</i>

150
00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:57.198
<i>"The Bobo'll getcha.</i>

151
00:09:57.233 --> 00:09:59.101
<i>Raw Head and Bloody Bones</i>
<i>will get you."</i>

152
00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:00.674
<i>You know. things like that.</i>

153
00:10:00.709 --> 00:10:03.303
My parents were no-nonsense.

154
00:10:03.338 --> 00:10:05.503
Uh. my dad would have never...

155
00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:08.781
even entertained the idea
of a ghost

156
00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:12.752
or some sort of monster
running around.

157
00:10:12.787 --> 00:10:14.688
- <i> It was a different time</i>

158
00:10:14.723 --> 00:10:17.086
<i>uh. growing up in the '70s.</i>

159
00:10:17.121 --> 00:10:19.990
<i>Uh. people. especially in</i>
<i>rural America.</i>

160
00:10:20.025 --> 00:10:22.223
<i>the... that was</i>
<i>nonsense to them.</i>

161
00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:23.422
<i>So</i> ...

162
00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:24.962
<i>I mean. there's</i>
<i>no other way to put it.</i>

163
00:10:24.997 --> 00:10:27.734
<i>And my... probably my dad's</i>
<i>solution would have been.</i>

164
00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:30.660
<i>"Hey. if there's a dog.</i>
<i>a Dogman or Bigfoot out there.</i>
<i>we'll just shoot it."</i>

165
00:10:30.695 --> 00:10:32.904
You know werewolves were...

166
00:10:32.939 --> 00:10:36.666
...Lon Chaney Jr. On TV8.

167
00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:39.845
- <i> And that's</i>
<i>my reference to werewolves.</i>

168
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.606
<i>Was. you know.</i>
<i>the werewolf. Lon Chaney Jr.</i>

169
00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:44.146
<i>With the...torn plaid shirt.</i>

170
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:45.983
<i>and the flat face.</i>

171
00:10:46.018 --> 00:10:49.349
and running around. grabbing
women and running off with them.

172
00:10:56.523 --> 00:11:00.767
My encounter happened
way back in 1972.

173
00:11:00.802 --> 00:11:02.769
between
Yellow Springs and Clifton.

174
00:11:11.307 --> 00:11:15.012
- <i> It started out as a...</i>
<i>most likely a Friday night.</i>

175
00:11:15.047 --> 00:11:17.674
<i>because I was allowed</i>
<i>to be out on Friday nights.</i>

176
00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:20.116
<i>I was about 17 at the time.</i>

177
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:22.822
<i>Out with the boyfriend.</i>

178
00:11:22.857 --> 00:11:25.550
and another couple.
we had two different...

179
00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:27.926
we had two cars. two sets of us.

180
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:30.830
and... well. you know
how kids are.

181
00:11:30.865 --> 00:11:33.899
We were out going to "park".

182
00:11:35.727 --> 00:11:39.872
- <i> We. uh. go down</i>
<i>the road. and the bridge</i>
<i>is totally out.</i>

183
00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:41.104
<i>there's just the barricade.</i>

184
00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:43.667
<i>So. we...</i>

185
00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:47.539
<i>turn around and make sure</i>
<i>that both of the vehicles</i>
<i>are facing out.</i>

186
00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:49.673
<i>So if the cops come along.</i>

187
00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:51.543
<i>you know. "We were just</i>
<i>leaving anyway.</i>

188
00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:52.885
<i>-"No big deal."</i>

189
00:11:54.515 --> 00:11:56.416
<i>Really. really dark.</i>

190
00:11:56.451 --> 00:11:58.154
<i>It was probably...</i>

191
00:11:58.189 --> 00:11:59.991
<i>it was cloudy. I don't know.</i>

192
00:12:01.753 --> 00:12:03.555
<i>There were no leaves</i>
<i>on the trees.</i>

193
00:12:04.426 --> 00:12:06.129
<i>But it wasn't real cold.</i>

194
00:12:06.164 --> 00:12:09.231
<i>so it was a perfect night</i>
<i>to be standing out</i>
<i>and laughing.</i>

195
00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:16.106
<i>I was leaning on...</i>

196
00:12:16.141 --> 00:12:18.372
<i>the car with my boyfriend.</i>

197
00:12:18.407 --> 00:12:20.979
<i>Nice muscle car.</i>
<i>back then.</i>

198
00:12:21.014 --> 00:12:22.882
<i>So I'm leaning...</i>

199
00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:24.774
<i>We're talking with</i>
<i>the other couple</i>

200
00:12:24.809 --> 00:12:26.248
<i>who's leaning on...</i>

201
00:12:26.283 --> 00:12:28.019
<i>their car. I don't know how</i>
<i>long we'd been there.</i>

202
00:12:28.054 --> 00:12:31.253
<i>maybe 15-20 minutes?</i>

203
00:12:34.995 --> 00:12:38.392
<i>There was gravel on the</i>
<i>berm of the road.</i>

204
00:12:38.427 --> 00:12:40.064
<i>And now remember. this is...</i>

205
00:12:40.099 --> 00:12:42.231
<i>just one way in and</i>
<i>one way out.</i>

206
00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:43.430
<i>because the bridge is out.</i>

207
00:12:45.467 --> 00:12:47.874
<i>Well. there's gravel</i>
<i>on the berm.</i>

208
00:12:47.909 --> 00:12:51.405
<i>There's a brush row next</i>
<i>to a creek.</i>

209
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.913
<i>and I see</i>

210
00:12:53.948 --> 00:12:57.312
<i>eye shine.</i>
<i>meaning an animal.</i>

211
00:12:57.347 --> 00:12:59.985
<i>up in the trees.</i>
<i>or so I'd thought.</i>

212
00:13:01.846 --> 00:13:03.681
<i>I mentioned out.</i>

213
00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:06.486
<i>"I wonder if that's a possum.</i>
<i>or a raccoon.</i>
<i>or what's up there?"</i>

214
00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:09.357
<i>And then...</i>

215
00:13:09.392 --> 00:13:11.293
<i>something walked out.</i>

216
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:14.032
<i>And it wasn't a possum.</i>

217
00:13:14.067 --> 00:13:16.364
<i>it wasn't a raccoon.</i>
<i>It was a...</i>

218
00:13:17.367 --> 00:13:18.498
<i>a creature.</i>

219
00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:20.500
<i>I have no idea</i>

220
00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:24.108
<i>at the time what it was.</i>
<i>nor did anyone else.</i>

221
00:13:24.143 --> 00:13:29.113
<i>To this day. I can distinctly</i>
<i>remember hearing the...</i>

222
00:13:29.148 --> 00:13:32.380
rustling of the gravel
that's on the berm.

223
00:13:34.989 --> 00:13:37.121
- <i> And... there's this</i>
<i>dark creature.</i>

224
00:13:37.156 --> 00:13:38.584
<i>It wasn't huge.</i>

225
00:13:40.357 --> 00:13:43.226
<i>Maybe five foot.</i>
<i>five and a half foot...</i>

226
00:13:43.261 --> 00:13:46.262
<i>six to eight feet away</i>
<i>from me.</i>

227
00:13:46.297 --> 00:13:48.627
<i>When it was in the. uh. weeds.</i>

228
00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:50.200
<i>it had its mouth closed.</i>

229
00:13:50.235 --> 00:13:52.466
<i>its eyes were amber.</i>

230
00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:55.139
<i>almond. sort of almond-shape.</i>

231
00:13:55.174 --> 00:13:59.539
The ears were very.
very close to the head.

232
00:13:59.574 --> 00:14:02.641
- <i> Pointed straight up.</i>
<i>but they weren't real</i>
<i>long ears.</i>

233
00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.247
<i>but they were pointed</i>
<i>straight up.</i>

234
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:12.992
- <i> My belief...</i>
<i>it was August of 1985.</i>

235
00:14:13.027 --> 00:14:16.424
<i>Um. at that time.</i>
<i>there was a friend</i>
<i>of the family.</i>

236
00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:18.624
<i>who. when I was</i>
<i>a high school athlete.</i>

237
00:14:18.659 --> 00:14:20.230
<i>and he had asked me if</i>
<i>I'd wanted</i>

238
00:14:20.265 --> 00:14:21.594
<i>to get into a fitness program.</i>

239
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:23.794
<i>a running program.</i>
<i>to be in shape.</i>

240
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:25.532
<i>I said. "Sure."</i>

241
00:14:25.567 --> 00:14:29.943
<i>So the plan was that I was</i>
<i>going to go out and run</i>
<i>five miles</i>

242
00:14:30.605 --> 00:14:32.110
<i>in the evening.</i>

243
00:14:32.145 --> 00:14:36.048
<i>I lived on State Route 4.</i>
<i>North 4381.</i>

244
00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:38.809
<i>At that time.</i>
<i>really the only place</i>
<i>for me to run</i>

245
00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:41.911
<i>was this little side road.</i>
<i>just south</i>

246
00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:44.089
<i>of my house</i>
<i>called Temple Road.</i>

247
00:14:45.994 --> 00:14:47.686
<i>If my memory serves</i>
<i>me correctly.</i>

248
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.754
<i>I was going to try</i>
<i>to get running at.</i>
<i>like. eight o'clock.</i>

249
00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:52.526
<i>And then I procrastinated.</i>
<i>and this happened and</i>
<i>that happened.</i>

250
00:14:52.561 --> 00:14:55.199
<i>And by the time I was actually</i>
<i>ready to go run.</i>

251
00:14:55.234 --> 00:14:56.398
<i>it was dark.</i>

252
00:14:56.433 --> 00:14:58.235
<i>You know. I was a country boy.</i>

253
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.039
<i>You know. I...I was</i>
<i>never afraid of the dark.</i>

254
00:15:00.074 --> 00:15:02.272
<i>So going out and running down</i>
<i>a country road at night.</i>

255
00:15:02.307 --> 00:15:04.703
<i>didn't bother me at all.</i>

256
00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:07.508
<i>I left my house. it was</i>
<i>probably little after nine.</i>

257
00:15:07.543 --> 00:15:09.950
<i>and it just... it had just</i>
<i>gotten dark.</i>

258
00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:12.183
<i>But it was a very clear night.</i>

259
00:15:12.218 --> 00:15:13.580
<i>I mean. it was really clear.</i>

260
00:15:13.615 --> 00:15:14.779
<i>visibility was good.</i>

261
00:15:14.814 --> 00:15:16.913
<i>I start down Temple Road.</i>

262
00:15:16.948 --> 00:15:19.883
<i>and at that time.</i>
<i>on the right hand side.</i>

263
00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:21.951
<i>which would be</i>
<i>the north side of the road.</i>

264
00:15:21.986 --> 00:15:24.426
<i>there was corn.</i>
<i>on the left side.</i>

265
00:15:24.461 --> 00:15:26.296
<i>which should be</i>
<i>the south side of Temple Road.</i>

266
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:27.726
<i>it was all beans.</i>

267
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.795
<i>And it stayed like that</i>
<i>all the way for one mile.</i>

268
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:31.895
<i>So...</i>

269
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.337
<i>I made it down the</i>
<i>State Route 19.</i>

270
00:15:34.372 --> 00:15:35.800
<i>and I was on my way back.</i>

271
00:15:35.835 --> 00:15:39.342
<i>and as I approached Flickinger</i>
<i>Road on the way back.</i>

272
00:15:39.377 --> 00:15:41.839
<i>which meant that I had</i>
<i>one mile to go.</i>

273
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.776
<i>I got this weird feeling.</i>

274
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:46.712
<i>It's this kind of feeling that</i>

275
00:15:46.747 --> 00:15:48.681
<i>you know. something's wrong.</i>

276
00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:51.189
<i>and you know. there's...</i>
<i>something's watching you.</i>

277
00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:53.323
<i>And...</i>

278
00:15:53.358 --> 00:15:56.788
<i>I felt like it was coming</i>
<i>from those woods. so I stopped.</i>

279
00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:59.626
<i>I don't know why I stopped.</i>
<i>but I stopped.</i>

280
00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:01.364
<i>and I looked into the woods...</i>

281
00:16:02.466 --> 00:16:03.828
<i>and I didn't see anything.</i>

282
00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:06.930
<i>I...I didn't hear anything.</i>
<i>I didn't see anything.</i>

283
00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:09.306
<i>As I was about to start</i>
<i>running again.</i>

284
00:16:09.341 --> 00:16:12.705
<i>in the cornfield. I see</i>
<i>the corn start moving.</i>

285
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.874
<i>-Whatever it was...</i>

286
00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:21.318
<i>...it was really big because</i>
<i>a lot of corn was moving.</i>

287
00:16:21.353 --> 00:16:23.221
<i>I mean.</i>
<i>a lot of corn is moving.</i>

288
00:16:23.256 --> 00:16:25.289
<i>and then all of a sudden.</i>
<i>it stopped.</i>

289
00:16:25.324 --> 00:16:27.720
<i>And I thought. "Wow. that's</i>
<i>strange."</i>

290
00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:29.194
<i>And so I said. "Well.</i>
<i>I'mma get out of here."</i>

291
00:16:29.229 --> 00:16:31.460
<i>So I take off running.</i>

292
00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:33.528
<i>and when I took off running</i>

293
00:16:33.563 --> 00:16:35.332
<i>whatever was in the corn...</i>

294
00:16:35.367 --> 00:16:37.796
<i>takes off running. too.</i>

295
00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:40.469
And that's what startled me.
really.

296
00:16:40.504 --> 00:16:42.702
because that's not
how deer behave.

297
00:16:42.737 --> 00:16:44.176
Deer gets. you know.

298
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:45.639
deer gets scared or
they get startled.

299
00:16:45.674 --> 00:16:47.707
or they get surprised.
and they just take off running.

300
00:16:47.742 --> 00:16:50.842
But this thing started
running with me.

301
00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:52.580
And when I say it started
running with me.

302
00:16:53.154 --> 00:16:55.154
it was pacing me.

303
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:57.189
- <i> It...and it kind of</i>
<i>freaked me out.</i>

304
00:16:57.224 --> 00:16:59.323
<i>so I stopped.</i>

305
00:16:59.358 --> 00:17:01.523
<i>And when I stopped...</i>

306
00:17:01.558 --> 00:17:03.195
<i>it stopped.</i>

307
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.198
<i>To this day.</i>
<i>I think it would've</i>
<i>had to been. at least</i>

308
00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:08.233
<i>three rows in.</i>

309
00:17:08.268 --> 00:17:11.863
<i>And so I remember</i>
<i>stopping thinking.</i>

310
00:17:11.898 --> 00:17:14.206
<i>'How does it know</i>
<i>that I stopped?'</i>

311
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:17.638
<i>So I stood there.</i>
<i>and as I stood there.</i>
<i>staring at the corn.</i>

312
00:17:17.673 --> 00:17:19.805
<i>I mean.</i>
<i>not a single stalk moved.</i>

313
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.280
<i>I mean. it was perfectly.</i>
<i>just still.</i>

314
00:17:22.315 --> 00:17:24.282
<i>Like this thing that was</i>
<i>in the corn.</i>

315
00:17:24.317 --> 00:17:27.681
<i>like it was just</i>
<i>perfectly still.</i>

316
00:17:27.716 --> 00:17:29.815
<i>And I don't know how long</i>
<i>I stood there.</i>

317
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.850
<i>but it spooked me.</i>

318
00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:34.226
<i>And... not knowing what it was.</i>

319
00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:35.887
<i>I said. "That's it. I'm taking</i>
<i>off."</i>

320
00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:37.053
<i>So...</i>

321
00:17:37.088 --> 00:17:38.758
<i>and when I took off.</i>

322
00:17:38.793 --> 00:17:41.057
<i>it takes off simultaneously.</i>

323
00:17:41.433 --> 00:17:42.696
<i>and...</i>

324
00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:45.094
<i>it's pacing me. and</i>
<i>I start running faster.</i>

325
00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:46.799
<i>and it starts running faster.</i>

326
00:17:48.407 --> 00:17:51.573
<i>I realize...</i>
<i>this thing's stalking me.</i>

327
00:17:51.608 --> 00:17:53.476
<i>Whatever...whatever is in</i>
<i>the corn.</i>

328
00:17:53.511 --> 00:17:56.875
I realize when I get to Route 4.

329
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.581
I'm going to have to
turn left to go home.

330
00:17:59.616 --> 00:18:02.518
And I'm just...assuming
this thing stays in the corn.

331
00:18:02.553 --> 00:18:03.915
- <i> Assuming it did.</i>

332
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.950
<i>When I get to Route 4 and</i>
<i>I turn left to go home.</i>

333
00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:07.952
<i>I'm gonna run right into it.</i>
<i>I'm going to intersect with it.</i>

334
00:18:08.757 --> 00:18:10.262
<i>And...</i>

335
00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:13.760
One of my best friends who lived
just down the road from me.

336
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.499
he was to the right.

337
00:18:16.534 --> 00:18:19.370
So...my thought is "Okay."

338
00:18:19.405 --> 00:18:21.801
"I'm not going to turn left
and go home. because
I don't want this...

339
00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:23.803
I don't want to intersect
with this thing.

340
00:18:23.838 --> 00:18:25.134
so I am going to cut right."

341
00:18:25.169 --> 00:18:26.740
So. I made up my mind.

342
00:18:26.775 --> 00:18:29.611
I was just going to stay
on the road.

343
00:18:29.646 --> 00:18:33.285
And when I get to Route 4.
I'm going to cut right.

344
00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.078
I'm gonna run to his house.

345
00:18:35.113 --> 00:18:38.884
So I realized that as
I'm going to get there.

346
00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:41.755
there...I'm gonna run out
of corn.

347
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.460
So whatever is in this corn

348
00:18:43.495 --> 00:18:46.628
is going to come out before
I actually get to Route 4.

349
00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:50.995
So. I told myself. "Don't look."

350
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.569
And the reason why I said.
in my mind.

351
00:18:53.604 --> 00:18:55.208
"Don't look." Because...

352
00:18:55.243 --> 00:18:57.001
I had no idea what it was.

353
00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:59.278
And part of me thought.

354
00:18:59.313 --> 00:19:02.413
"If I looked.
I might freeze up."

355
00:19:02.448 --> 00:19:04.041
I'm coming to the end
of the corn.

356
00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.252
and...

357
00:19:06.287 --> 00:19:08.353
I looked.
I couldn't help myself.

358
00:19:08.388 --> 00:19:10.487
I...I...I could not help myself.

359
00:19:10.522 --> 00:19:13.820
As I'm running. I kind of
turned my body like this.

360
00:19:13.855 --> 00:19:15.690
to just kind of. like...

361
00:19:15.725 --> 00:19:17.186
side shuffle.

362
00:19:17.221 --> 00:19:18.990
and that's when I saw it.

363
00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:24.369
This thing emerges from
the corn.

364
00:19:24.404 --> 00:19:26.272
and it was about six feet tall.

365
00:19:26.307 --> 00:19:28.307
because that's how tall
the corn was.

366
00:19:29.233 --> 00:19:30.936
And. it...

367
00:19:30.971 --> 00:19:32.509
had the head of a dog.

368
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.512
<i>high pointed ears.</i>

369
00:19:35.547 --> 00:19:38.878
- <i> And it's shoulders</i>
<i>were rolled like this.</i>

370
00:19:38.913 --> 00:19:42.211
<i>like it had. like. terrible</i>
<i>pos...like a person</i>
<i>with terrible posture.</i>

371
00:19:42.246 --> 00:19:46.655
<i>It's shoulder rolled and</i>
<i>its arms were long.</i>

372
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.823
<i>and. I remember.</i>
<i>it just turned its head</i>

373
00:19:49.858 --> 00:19:51.561
<i>like this and looked at me.</i>

374
00:19:53.532 --> 00:19:56.500
<i>I saw its head.</i>
<i>I saw the ears.</i>

375
00:19:56.535 --> 00:19:59.569
<i>Could I tell you</i>
<i>what color its fur was? No.</i>

376
00:19:59.604 --> 00:20:02.132
<i>It could have been</i>
<i>real dark gray.</i>
<i>it could have been black.</i>

377
00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:03.573
<i>It could have been dark brown.</i>

378
00:20:03.608 --> 00:20:06.708
<i>I can't tell you what color</i>
<i>the fur was for sure.</i>

379
00:20:06.743 --> 00:20:09.843
<i>The interesting thing is.</i>
<i>when I saw it.</i>

380
00:20:09.878 --> 00:20:12.241
I didn't immediately think
werewolf.

381
00:20:12.276 --> 00:20:14.386
I just didn't. because...

382
00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:16.850
as we talked about.
my frame of reference

383
00:20:16.885 --> 00:20:21.624
for what a werewolf was.
was something I had seen on TV8.

384
00:20:21.659 --> 00:20:27.190
It was a man with a flat face.
and it wore torn.
tattered clothes.

385
00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:29.368
It did not look like what I saw.

386
00:20:29.403 --> 00:20:31.832
And the only frame
of reference that I had.

387
00:20:31.867 --> 00:20:35.671
<i>was it looked just</i>
<i>like the Egyptian God. Anubis.</i>

388
00:20:35.706 --> 00:20:37.706
<i>That's the best way</i>
<i>I can describe it.</i>

389
00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:45.747
There was an almost
a crackling feeling.

390
00:20:45.782 --> 00:20:48.211
The hair on the back
of my neck stood up.

391
00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:52.358
Almost like a static.
static electricity. maybe.

392
00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:02.302
- <i> And. I suppose that's</i>
<i>a sixth sense. saying.</i>
<i>"It's time to leave."</i>

393
00:21:05.769 --> 00:21:11.806
I don't know whose voice it was.
and I hear "Let's go. now."

394
00:21:11.841 --> 00:21:15.612
I run around and the creature.

395
00:21:15.647 --> 00:21:18.450
it didn't move like a human.

396
00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:22.619
- <i> Maybe. it moved like</i>
<i>a dog that's walking</i>
<i>on its hind legs.</i>

397
00:21:22.654 --> 00:21:25.820
<i>It almost moved kangaroo-like.</i>

398
00:21:25.855 --> 00:21:29.087
<i>Like the legs were bent</i>
<i>the wrong way.</i>

399
00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:31.991
<i>That's sort of freakier</i>
<i>than about anything.</i>

400
00:21:32.026 --> 00:21:34.532
<i>is to see something that</i>

401
00:21:34.567 --> 00:21:37.634
your mind does not
want to grasp.

402
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:40.329
And it's on two legs.

403
00:21:40.364 --> 00:21:46.577
- <i> It kind of does</i>
<i>a hop. skipping motion.</i>
<i>not very many feet.</i>

404
00:21:46.612 --> 00:21:50.009
<i>It followed me. which</i>
<i>was no big deal</i>
<i>and it was so close.</i>

405
00:21:50.044 --> 00:21:55.146
<i>It did its hop skipping motion</i>
<i>and I could see it out</i>
<i>of my periphery.</i>

406
00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:57.852
<i>And it followed me</i>
<i>as I ran around.</i>

407
00:21:57.887 --> 00:22:01.988
I managed to get
into my. uh. passenger side.

408
00:22:02.023 --> 00:22:07.290
<i>And. as he pulls off.</i>
<i>because there was so</i>
<i>much gravel.</i>

409
00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:09.930
<i>the gravel</i>
<i>was spinning some.</i>

410
00:22:09.965 --> 00:22:14.165
<i>and it was running</i>
<i>alongside of the car.</i>

411
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.642
<i>looking at me. straight.</i>
<i>you know. straight in the eye.</i>

412
00:22:18.677 --> 00:22:22.008
<i>It's really hard to explain</i>
<i>unless you've ever had</i>

413
00:22:22.043 --> 00:22:25.275
<i>something that maybe</i>
<i>can't be explained.</i>

414
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.849
You know. that's
happened to you.

415
00:22:27.884 --> 00:22:31.457
I simply focused on the eyes
and its movement.

416
00:22:31.492 --> 00:22:34.658
because its movement
was so unusual to me.

417
00:22:34.693 --> 00:22:38.761
I really can't say
how many feet it followed.

418
00:22:38.796 --> 00:22:41.665
hopping along. beside the car.

419
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.865
But. I sort of felt in danger.

420
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.967
I wasn't terrified because

421
00:22:47.002 --> 00:22:50.542
nothing was going into my head
the way it should.

422
00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:55.173
I guess it's what happens
when you encounter something

423
00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:58.451
that you have no parameters
for what it is.

424
00:23:01.214 --> 00:23:04.886
And when I saw it.
I did kind of pause.

425
00:23:04.921 --> 00:23:09.055
I didn't freeze. but I did kind
of pause. and I looked at it.

426
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.058
- <i> Like I said.</i>
<i>there's weeds. wildflowers</i>

427
00:23:12.093 --> 00:23:14.665
<i>and other stuff that runs</i>
<i>right up to the corn.</i>

428
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.361
<i>So all I could see</i>
<i>was from. like. thigh down.</i>

429
00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:20.165
<i>so I don't know what</i>
<i>his feet look like.</i>

430
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.607
<i>I don't know what its knees</i>
<i>look like or anything</i>
<i>like that.</i>

431
00:23:23.467 --> 00:23:25.742
<i>But. I saw its torso.</i>

432
00:23:25.777 --> 00:23:28.173
<i>It... But. when it turned</i>
<i>and looked at me.</i>

433
00:23:28.208 --> 00:23:32.914
<i>it just looked like</i>
<i>it had this massive chest.</i>

434
00:23:32.949 --> 00:23:34.685
<i>So I take off across</i>
<i>Route 4.</i>

435
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.688
<i>So. I'm. I'm gunning it</i>
<i>as fast as I can.</i>

436
00:23:37.723 --> 00:23:41.527
<i>This thing has dropped</i>
<i>to all fours and is chasing me.</i>

437
00:23:41.562 --> 00:23:43.628
<i>As I'm getting closer</i>
<i>to my buddy's house.</i>

438
00:23:43.663 --> 00:23:46.829
<i>I knew that they</i>
<i>had an in-ground pool.</i>

439
00:23:46.864 --> 00:23:49.634
<i>And they had a fence</i>
<i>around. a chain link fence.</i>

440
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:54.133
<i>But as I'm getting closer.</i>
<i>I look and I see</i>
<i>the gates shut.</i>

441
00:23:54.168 --> 00:23:56.036
<i>I was like. "Oh."</i>

442
00:23:56.071 --> 00:23:58.236
And I know if this thing
is following me.

443
00:23:58.271 --> 00:24:00.612
my only options is.
I'm just going to have
to jump the fence.

444
00:24:00.647 --> 00:24:04.308
- <i> So I jump</i>
<i>and I throw my feet up</i>
<i>like in the air.</i>

445
00:24:04.343 --> 00:24:06.475
<i>like the old Fosbury flop</i>
<i>high jump.</i>

446
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.346
And I put my hand
on the top of the fence
and it was scalloped.

447
00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:10.446
I remember this.

448
00:24:10.481 --> 00:24:12.624
It had those. y'know.
the scallops.

449
00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:15.792
And I pushed it down
and when I did.
and then it popped back up.

450
00:24:15.827 --> 00:24:18.828
it just slashed me
right across my side.

451
00:24:18.863 --> 00:24:23.965
I land in like a stumbling
motion. and I just dive
headfirst into the pool.

452
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.132
- <i> And I'm blowing out</i>
<i>my breath and I am going down</i>

453
00:24:26.167 --> 00:24:30.103
<i>and I can feel it. I can</i>
<i>still feel it. sliding out</i>
<i>the pool. It was ten feet deep.</i>

454
00:24:30.138 --> 00:24:32.171
<i>I'm sliding down.</i>

455
00:24:32.206 --> 00:24:34.844
<i>I blow all the air out</i>
<i>and I get to the bottom.</i>

456
00:24:34.879 --> 00:24:40.685
<i>And I somehow pinch my nose</i>
<i>and I look up and I am fully</i>
<i>expecting to see this thing.</i>

457
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.655
<i>with the rolled shoulders</i>
<i>and the dog head.</i>

458
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.449
<i>and the big chest</i>
<i>sitting on the side</i>
<i>of the pool.</i>

459
00:24:48.552 --> 00:24:51.454
<i>But it seemed like a long time.</i>
<i>I was on the bottom pool</i>
<i>and I'm looking up.</i>

460
00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:52.565
<i>and I'm looking up</i>

461
00:24:53.865 --> 00:24:55.524
<i>and I don't see anything.</i>

462
00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:58.197
<i>So I'm like.</i>
<i>"Oh. my God."</i>

463
00:24:58.232 --> 00:25:00.936
I climb up out of the pool
and I run.

464
00:25:00.971 --> 00:25:04.434
And I rip that door open
as hard as I can.

465
00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:09.307
And my buddy was sitting there.
he screams and I scream.

466
00:25:09.342 --> 00:25:11.474
And I slammed the door.

467
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.542
And I remember screaming.

468
00:25:13.577 --> 00:25:14.983
"Turn the lights out.
turn the lights out."

469
00:25:15.986 --> 00:25:17.656
And he has no idea
what's going on.

470
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:20.791
So we turn the lights out
and I'm just looking
out the windows.

471
00:25:20.826 --> 00:25:24.388
I'm looking out the windows.
thinking. "Is this thing
out there?"

472
00:25:29.098 --> 00:25:31.868
- <i> The next night.</i>
<i>I played cards with guys</i>

473
00:25:31.903 --> 00:25:33.804
<i>on the basketball team.</i>

474
00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:35.905
and I told them the story.

475
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.204
But I did not tell them
what I saw.

476
00:25:38.239 --> 00:25:42.043
I vividly remember. um.
the next night.

477
00:25:42.078 --> 00:25:43.814
We were at a friend's house.

478
00:25:43.849 --> 00:25:47.543
So we're all in the garage.
outside. playing cards.

479
00:25:47.578 --> 00:25:50.381
It was a... It was a bunch
of us guys. that went
to high school together.

480
00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:53.923
And he's telling the story
about outrunning.

481
00:25:53.958 --> 00:25:57.795
and having something
pacing him in the cornfield.

482
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:03.867
We... We were all teammates.
and what teammates do is we give
each other a bunch of crap.

483
00:26:03.902 --> 00:26:06.870
He probably already got
enough crap from us as it was.

484
00:26:06.905 --> 00:26:08.971
so he didn't want
to get any more.

485
00:26:09.006 --> 00:26:14.207
And... And you don't want
to be called crazy. y'know.
but he did tell us the story.

486
00:26:14.242 --> 00:26:16.407
I remember the story
and he's asking. like.

487
00:26:16.442 --> 00:26:18.915
"What do you guys
think this was?"

488
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:23.689
And. nobody had an answer.

489
00:26:23.724 --> 00:26:27.220
- <i> When I did</i>
<i>the research. I found out</i>
<i>that on Flickinger Road</i>

490
00:26:27.255 --> 00:26:29.860
<i>to just down</i>
<i>on Flickinger Road.</i>

491
00:26:29.895 --> 00:26:32.555
<i>is at least two</i>
<i>Indian burial grounds.</i>

492
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:37.461
<i>So. that made me start</i>
<i>thinking in a. in a totally</i>
<i>different way</i>

493
00:26:37.496 --> 00:26:39.232
<i>than what I always thought.</i>

494
00:26:39.267 --> 00:26:43.236
<i>For years I had thought.</i>
<i>this is a flesh</i>
<i>and blood creature.</i>

495
00:26:43.271 --> 00:26:45.502
<i>That it's wolf-like</i>
<i>or dog-like.</i>

496
00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:48.439
<i>and no one seems</i>
<i>to catch them because</i>
<i>they are really fast.</i>

497
00:26:48.474 --> 00:26:50.749
<i>They're really smart.</i>
<i>they're really stealthy.</i>

498
00:26:50.784 --> 00:26:56.315
Now my mindset has switched
to. um. "I think these
are supernatural creatures."

499
00:26:57.483 --> 00:26:59.351
That's my opinion.

500
00:26:59.386 --> 00:27:03.520
I revisited where this happened
about a year and a half ago.

501
00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:04.829
I hadn't been...

502
00:27:04.864 --> 00:27:08.899
I hadn't been back
in those many. many years.

503
00:27:08.934 --> 00:27:11.627
- <i> I found out there's</i>
<i>Indian mounds there.</i>

504
00:27:11.662 --> 00:27:18.711
<i>Adena Indians. which are very.</i>
<i>were very common in this part</i>
<i>of Ohio.</i>

505
00:27:18.746 --> 00:27:22.407
<i>I've read. where your Dogman.</i>
<i>for some reason.</i>

506
00:27:22.442 --> 00:27:26.279
<i>are found</i>
<i>or seen frequently</i>

507
00:27:26.314 --> 00:27:27.720
<i>where there's Indian mounds.</i>

508
00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:30.184
<i>so I don't know.</i>

509
00:27:30.219 --> 00:27:33.121
<i>Y'know. I just. I don't know</i>
<i>what to say to that.</i>

510
00:27:33.156 --> 00:27:38.060
- <i> If you believe</i>
<i>the aspect of a Dogman.</i>
<i>werewolf creature</i>

511
00:27:38.095 --> 00:27:41.657
<i>being more supernatural</i>
<i>than natural.</i>

512
00:27:41.692 --> 00:27:47.630
<i>you can't hardly go any.</i>
<i>anywhere here and not have</i>
<i>a Native American settlement.</i>

513
00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:53.977
It just lends itself to that
angle of these creatures

514
00:27:54.012 --> 00:27:59.312
<i>being y'know.</i>
<i>the guardians of the Native</i>
<i>American burial mounds.</i>

515
00:27:59.347 --> 00:28:00.610
<i>or grounds.</i>

516
00:28:07.322 --> 00:28:10.719
My name is Adam Davis.
and I've...

517
00:28:10.754 --> 00:28:14.228
After personal experiences.
initially with Dogman.

518
00:28:14.263 --> 00:28:20.531
I've been a researcher since
about. officially since.
about 2005.

519
00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:27.439
The... My initial. actual
sighting was in 2005.
back in October 19th.

520
00:28:27.474 --> 00:28:33.412
<i>After we had initially</i>
<i>started hearing about</i>

521
00:28:33.447 --> 00:28:37.647
<i>different howling</i>
<i>reports of everything</i>
<i>out around</i>

522
00:28:37.682 --> 00:28:40.958
<i>uh. the Germantown</i>
<i>and Liberty. Ohio area.</i>

523
00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:48.196
<i>My girlfriend and I</i>
<i>decided to go out</i>
<i>to Anthony Road and...</i>

524
00:28:49.529 --> 00:28:51.562
<i>And to see if we could find</i>
<i>any tracks.</i>

525
00:28:52.598 --> 00:28:54.400
<i>And as we crossed the bridge.</i>

526
00:28:55.843 --> 00:28:58.107
<i>I was doing my usual thing.</i>

527
00:28:58.142 --> 00:29:00.241
<i>looking down at the sandbars.</i>

528
00:29:00.276 --> 00:29:02.078
<i>Y'know. to see if there</i>
<i>was anything there.</i>

529
00:29:02.113 --> 00:29:04.080
<i>I didn't see any tracks.</i>

530
00:29:04.115 --> 00:29:07.853
<i>Because sometimes we would see</i>
<i>tracks in the sand bars.</i>

531
00:29:07.888 --> 00:29:13.419
<i>And we got across the bridge</i>
<i>and it kind of takes</i>
<i>a little turn.</i>

532
00:29:13.454 --> 00:29:16.752
<i>And down.</i>
<i>down a little downhill.</i>

533
00:29:16.787 --> 00:29:21.394
<i>And. I tell her to stop</i>
<i>because I see something black.</i>

534
00:29:21.429 --> 00:29:24.232
<i>over on the right hand</i>
<i>side of the road.</i>

535
00:29:24.267 --> 00:29:26.102
<i>I was... You know...</i>

536
00:29:26.137 --> 00:29:29.798
<i>I was on the passenger side.</i>
<i>so it was on my side.</i>

537
00:29:29.833 --> 00:29:32.977
<i>And. I was...</i>
<i>Because I was looking</i>
<i>in the mud</i>

538
00:29:33.012 --> 00:29:35.848
<i>and silt and everything.</i>
<i>to see if there was any tracks.</i>

539
00:29:39.018 --> 00:29:43.581
<i>I get out and I go over to it</i>
<i>and I look at it.</i>

540
00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:45.616
<i>And I realize it's an article</i>
<i>of clothing.</i>

541
00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:51.589
<i>It was a pair of pants.</i>
<i>of women's brand of pants.</i>
<i>in a petite size.</i>

542
00:29:51.624 --> 00:29:53.525
<i>And I pick them up</i>
<i>and I'm looking at them.</i>

543
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:59.564
<i>And there's silt on the back</i>
<i>of the pants from where they</i>
<i>had lain...</i>

544
00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:06.439
<i>lain against the dampness</i>
<i>of the ground. and they were</i>
<i>slightly damp from the rain.</i>

545
00:30:06.474 --> 00:30:12.885
<i>And then I took them and turned</i>
<i>them around. and I realized</i>
<i>that it was...</i>

546
00:30:20.026 --> 00:30:21.487
<i> I realized</i>

547
00:30:21.522 --> 00:30:23.687
<i>that the front of the pants...</i>

548
00:30:23.722 --> 00:30:25.425
<i>were just like.</i>
<i>totally shredded.</i>

549
00:30:27.429 --> 00:30:29.066
<i>And matted with blood.</i>

550
00:30:29.101 --> 00:30:33.499
<i>And it was not dried blood</i>
<i>or anything.</i>

551
00:30:33.534 --> 00:30:35.336
<i>It was just congealing.</i>

552
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.338
<i>I look across the road.</i>

553
00:30:38.737 --> 00:30:42.541
<i>and I see red fabric.</i>

554
00:30:42.576 --> 00:30:46.952
<i>So. I mean. at this point</i>
<i>in time. it was kind of...</i>

555
00:30:46.987 --> 00:30:51.253
<i> And I really</i>
<i>was starting to put together</i>
<i>what I'm seeing.</i>

556
00:30:51.288 --> 00:30:55.521
<i>And. y'know.</i>
<i>as I'm looking at it.</i>
<i>I walk across the road</i>

557
00:30:55.556 --> 00:31:00.130
<i>and I find a sweater and a...</i>
<i>and a T shirt</i>

558
00:31:00.165 --> 00:31:02.198
<i>that are still partially</i>
<i>inside of each other.</i>

559
00:31:04.004 --> 00:31:09.040
I looked... and I looked
at it and there was blood
there on the sweater.

560
00:31:09.075 --> 00:31:11.009
But the T-shirt was worse.

561
00:31:11.044 --> 00:31:13.913
<i>It was shredded</i>
<i>and matted with blood.</i>

562
00:31:15.048 --> 00:31:18.181
<i>and I called the police.</i>

563
00:31:18.216 --> 00:31:21.052
<i>I got ahold of dispatch</i>
<i>and told them what we found.</i>

564
00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.287
<i>And. this is what</i>
<i>really kills me.</i>

565
00:31:27.093 --> 00:31:29.291
<i>They laughed it off.</i>

566
00:31:29.326 --> 00:31:33.460
<i>They said. "Oh. it's probably</i>
<i>just someone's trash that.</i>
<i>that they left out there."</i>

567
00:31:33.495 --> 00:31:35.363
<i>It's nothing.</i>
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

568
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:42.106
<i>So. I told my girlfriend.</i>
<i>"We're going to go</i>
<i>to the house."</i>

569
00:31:42.141 --> 00:31:44.438
<i>"We're going to get a bag</i>
<i>and come back for this."</i>

570
00:31:44.473 --> 00:31:47.903
<i>Because we didn't have</i>
<i>anything to put it in.</i>

571
00:31:47.938 --> 00:31:52.578
<i>It was maybe ten minutes</i>
<i>from there to the house</i>
<i>and back.</i>

572
00:31:52.613 --> 00:31:55.713
<i>We got back.</i>
<i>those clothes were gone.</i>

573
00:31:58.421 --> 00:32:01.818
<i>They had taken a vehicle</i>
<i>and driven over the places</i>

574
00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:05.756
<i>where those clothes</i>
<i>were laying. where there</i>
<i>was an imprint in the mud.</i>

575
00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:08.924
<i>or any trace of blood</i>
<i>because they were. the...</i>

576
00:32:08.959 --> 00:32:12.631
<i>the sweater and the T-shirt</i>
<i>were laying in...</i>

577
00:32:12.666 --> 00:32:15.172
<i>on the edge of the road</i>
<i>in the. in the tall grass.</i>

578
00:32:16.802 --> 00:32:24.808
<i>In 2015. I wind up meeting up</i>
<i>with this guy from Hamilton.</i>

579
00:32:24.843 --> 00:32:30.451
<i>He was telling us how he had</i>
<i>been. y' know. looking</i>
<i>at anomalous. reports.</i>

580
00:32:30.486 --> 00:32:36.325
<i>and everything. where</i>
<i>he was getting descriptions</i>
<i>of oversize. heeded prints.</i>

581
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.955
<i>He said he was basically</i>
<i>going from house to house.</i>

582
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:44.300
<i>through the Germantown</i>
<i>dam area. y'know.</i>
<i>where there were...</i>

583
00:32:44.335 --> 00:32:47.303
<i>Where there's houses</i>
<i>along the edge of the park.</i>

584
00:32:47.338 --> 00:32:50.306
<i>And. he came</i>
<i>to this one family</i>

585
00:32:50.341 --> 00:32:54.937
<i>that said that</i>
<i>in 2000... April 2006.</i>

586
00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:58.578
<i>their daughter went out</i>
<i>one morning.</i>
<i>to go out jogging</i>

587
00:32:58.613 --> 00:33:04.155
<i>like she usually would do.</i>
<i>and she never came back.</i>

588
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:10.293
<i>She went out jogging along</i>
<i>Anthony Road. and up around</i>
<i>the backside of the dam.</i>

589
00:33:10.328 --> 00:33:14.495
<i> I just dropped</i>
<i>to my knees</i>
<i>when I heard this.</i>

590
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.696
I mean. it was confirmation.
but it was like the worst kind
of confirmation.

591
00:33:21.339 --> 00:33:27.475
<i>There was no question</i>
<i>in my mind that if it was</i>
<i>something that he...</i>

592
00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.576
<i>It was a Dogman that did that.</i>

593
00:33:29.611 --> 00:33:33.943
Because. first of all.
what would have happened?

594
00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:37.320
<i>What would have happened</i>
<i>to the body otherwise?</i>

595
00:33:37.355 --> 00:33:41.786
<i>The body was gone.</i>
<i>The clothes were shredded.</i>

596
00:33:41.821 --> 00:33:45.196
<i>There's no bear out there.</i>
<i>There's no cougars out there.</i>

597
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:47.528
There's no natural predators
that would do that.

598
00:33:47.563 --> 00:33:50.564
<i>And there is. from what I've</i>
<i>heard of other reports.</i>

599
00:33:50.599 --> 00:33:55.239
<i>there are the reports of the</i>
<i>where they will. y'know.</i>

600
00:33:55.274 --> 00:33:59.408
<i>essentially shred off</i>
<i>the clothes off of a human</i>
<i>in an attack.</i>

601
00:33:59.443 --> 00:34:02.411
<i>The LBLO case is one of them.</i>

602
00:34:02.446 --> 00:34:08.010
<i>If... from the Land Between</i>
<i>the Lakes back in '82.</i>

603
00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:12.454
<i>That... They said that</i>
<i>the victims were pretty</i>
<i>much disrobed</i>

604
00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:14.390
<i>of their clothes.</i>
<i>they were just shredded off.</i>

605
00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.955
And I've heard of other reports.

606
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.959
Where there were attacks
or at least alleged attacks.

607
00:34:29.099 --> 00:34:30.604
- <i> Ah.</i>
<i>there is a great deal of fear</i>

608
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.244
<i>inherent within these</i>
<i>particular encounters.</i>

609
00:34:33.279 --> 00:34:38.447
It is as if a very
intelligent animal

610
00:34:38.482 --> 00:34:41.747
<i>is evaluating you.</i>

611
00:34:41.782 --> 00:34:44.948
<i>I've heard reports</i>
<i>of people seeing them.</i>

612
00:34:44.983 --> 00:34:48.787
<i>just watching them</i>
<i>from the trees and making</i>
<i>no other kind of movement.</i>

613
00:34:48.822 --> 00:34:54.397
<i>Um. I also have taken reports</i>
<i>from people that have claimed</i>
<i>that they've heard them</i>

614
00:34:54.432 --> 00:34:57.730
<i>coming up onto the porch</i>
<i>and trying the doorknob.</i>

615
00:34:57.765 --> 00:35:02.636
<i>Or. y'know. even more uncanny.</i>
<i>trying to call them outside.</i>

616
00:35:02.671 --> 00:35:05.309
These are the things that
that raise the hackles

617
00:35:05.344 --> 00:35:07.773
on the neck and goose bumps
and everything else.

618
00:35:07.808 --> 00:35:11.249
But. we are definitely dealing
with not just an animal.

619
00:35:11.284 --> 00:35:12.778
we're dealing
with something here

620
00:35:12.813 --> 00:35:15.011
<i>that has a particular</i>
<i>intelligence to it.</i>

621
00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:18.652
- <i> Ah. but from all the</i>
<i>encounters that I've...</i>
<i>that I've taken notes on</i>

622
00:35:18.687 --> 00:35:22.425
<i>and the eyewitnesses</i>
<i>I have investigated.</i>
<i>and spoken with.</i>

623
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.954
<i>um. it's never</i>
<i>a pleasant encounter.</i>

624
00:35:23.989 --> 00:35:27.155
You don't come out of this
feeling enlivened in any way.

625
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:28.464
Encounters with dogmen.

626
00:35:28.499 --> 00:35:30.598
encounters with these
werewolf type beings.

627
00:35:30.633 --> 00:35:34.162
is something that. um.
is the stuff of nightmares.

628
00:35:34.197 --> 00:35:35.702
<i>Again. people</i>
<i>have asked me.</i>

629
00:35:35.737 --> 00:35:39.101
<i>"What happens whenever</i>
<i>you encounter these things?"</i>

630
00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:41.004
<i>Well. we really</i>
<i>don't know. do we?</i>

631
00:35:41.039 --> 00:35:44.513
<i>I mean. a lot of people</i>
<i>go missing and are never</i>
<i>heard from again.</i>

632
00:35:44.548 --> 00:35:47.549
<i>So. it might have been</i>
<i>an encounter with one</i>
<i>of these creatures.</i>

633
00:36:09.375 --> 00:36:10.671
<i>Land Between the Lakes</i>

634
00:36:10.706 --> 00:36:13.377
<i>is the largest inland peninsula</i>
<i>in America.</i>

635
00:36:13.412 --> 00:36:15.511
<i>And it wasn't always like that.</i>

636
00:36:15.546 --> 00:36:18.976
<i>It used to be a much smaller</i>
<i>trickle of water coming through</i>
<i>a couple of rivers.</i>

637
00:36:19.011 --> 00:36:21.286
It used to be called.
Between the Rivers.

638
00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:24.553
And for whatever reason.
they flooded the areas

639
00:36:24.588 --> 00:36:27.391
and made Lake Barkley
and Lake Kentucky.

640
00:36:27.426 --> 00:36:30.724
And that caused the creation
of Land Between the Lakes.

641
00:36:30.759 --> 00:36:32.990
<i>You got that large</i>
<i>inland peninsula. in America.</i>

642
00:36:33.025 --> 00:36:36.158
<i>There are over 200 cemeteries</i>
<i>in Land Between the Lakes.</i>
<i>y'know.</i>

643
00:36:36.193 --> 00:36:40.030
<i>It's got. really a dark history</i>
<i>because you know a lot</i>
<i>of people's homes.</i>

644
00:36:40.065 --> 00:36:43.066
<i>when they were getting</i>
<i>the area ready. they ran</i>
<i>them out of their homes.</i>

645
00:36:43.101 --> 00:36:45.376
<i>The government threatened them</i>
<i>in one way or another.</i>

646
00:36:48.513 --> 00:36:52.845
<i>There is a lot of dark history</i>
<i>with this land. and I believe</i>

647
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.518
<i>there's even a lot</i>
<i>of cemeteries</i>
<i>that are under water now.</i>

648
00:36:55.553 --> 00:36:58.422
<i>You can still go across</i>
<i>the land and find people's</i>
<i>old homesteads.</i>

649
00:36:58.457 --> 00:37:01.755
<i>where you can see the evidence</i>
<i>where they...</i>

650
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.297
<i>they took over the area</i>
<i>by I reckon. eminent domain.</i>

651
00:37:07.466 --> 00:37:10.434
<i>Since the 1700s.</i>
<i>before they flooded everything.</i>

652
00:37:10.469 --> 00:37:12.227
<i>French explorers</i>
<i>were coming through</i>
<i>the regions.</i>

653
00:37:12.262 --> 00:37:15.098
and they would report that
there were Rougarous
in the region.

654
00:37:16.002 --> 00:37:18.002
<i>Basically a French werewolf.</i>

655
00:37:18.037 --> 00:37:20.576
<i>Y'know. they were very</i>
<i>superstitious about that kind</i>
<i>of thing back then.</i>

656
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:24.140
<i>So. they probably thought</i>
<i>there are werewolves</i>
<i>in this area.</i>

657
00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.552
Of all the Native American
history here.

658
00:37:29.587 --> 00:37:31.785
I don't know of all the
tribes that were here.

659
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.886
But there is a legend
of the Shawnee tribes.

660
00:37:33.921 --> 00:37:37.527
that there was a Shawnee
medicine man. in the region.

661
00:37:37.562 --> 00:37:44.468
who was a skin walker and they
blamed him for some
of the werewolf incidents.

662
00:37:44.503 --> 00:37:46.569
- <i> Some. something</i>
<i>of that nature.</i>

663
00:37:46.604 --> 00:37:49.902
What is so interesting
about this particular area.

664
00:37:49.937 --> 00:37:54.379
<i>is. this was the area of</i>
<i>for the Woodland Indians.</i>

665
00:37:54.414 --> 00:38:00.913
<i>There was a wolf cult part</i>
<i>of that culture at one time.</i>
<i>maybe as early as 1300.</i>

666
00:38:00.948 --> 00:38:04.279
<i>There's instances of</i>
<i>mounds being uncovered.</i>

667
00:38:04.314 --> 00:38:09.361
<i>where the entombed person</i>
<i>was made to appear as if</i>

668
00:38:09.396 --> 00:38:12.397
<i>it were an amalgamation</i>
<i>of man and wolf.</i>

669
00:38:12.432 --> 00:38:16.324
<i>One particular tomb</i>
<i>had the body wrapped in furs</i>

670
00:38:16.359 --> 00:38:20.504
<i>and the jaw was actually</i>
<i>dislocated and some</i>
<i>of the teeth were removed.</i>

671
00:38:20.539 --> 00:38:24.002
<i>in order to place</i>
<i>a wolf snout over it.</i>

672
00:38:24.037 --> 00:38:27.412
<i>What was going on in this area</i>
<i>is really kind of strange.</i>

673
00:38:27.447 --> 00:38:29.073
whenever you talk about this.

674
00:38:29.108 --> 00:38:32.978
this assuming of man and wolf
at the same time.

675
00:38:33.013 --> 00:38:37.488
- <i> Because these mounds</i>
<i>in which this culture</i>
<i>was a part of.</i>

676
00:38:37.523 --> 00:38:39.622
<i>is very near to Defiance. Ohio.</i>

677
00:38:39.657 --> 00:38:42.152
<i>very near</i>
<i>to Elkhorn. Wisconsin.</i>

678
00:38:42.187 --> 00:38:47.465
<i>and also very close to the area</i>
<i>of Land Between the Lakes</i>
<i>as well.</i>

679
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.730
- <i> It's</i>
<i>always seemed like</i>

680
00:38:48.765 --> 00:38:50.963
<i>Dogman is a bit</i>
<i>aggressive in nature.</i>

681
00:38:50.998 --> 00:38:54.967
because you hear so many stories
of people that see it and it
chases them out of an area.

682
00:38:55.002 --> 00:38:59.510
Uh. but. there are multiple
sightings. up from here
in the region where people

683
00:38:59.545 --> 00:39:04.647
just see it run across the trail
or it doesn't chase them.
y'know. they'll just see it.

684
00:39:04.682 --> 00:39:06.308
<i>It seems to be there's</i>

685
00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:08.750
<i>a physical creature of some</i>
<i>kind. uh. y'know.</i>

686
00:39:08.785 --> 00:39:10.686
We find footprints
in the region.

687
00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:14.591
A gentleman's seen a mother
Dogman and pups run across
the roads.

688
00:39:14.626 --> 00:39:18.056
So. there seems to be some kind
of biological animal.
in the region.

689
00:39:18.091 --> 00:39:19.563
- <i> Everything</i>
<i>that we can find. y'know.</i>

690
00:39:19.598 --> 00:39:21.389
<i>You have families</i>
<i>that are physically attacked.</i>

691
00:39:21.424 --> 00:39:27.505
<i>And. people that come up</i>
<i>missing. people supposedly</i>
<i>eating upon.</i>

692
00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.200
<i>It's alive. it's aggressive.</i>
<i>It needs to eat.</i>

693
00:39:38.749 --> 00:39:41.211
We had just moved.
I was married at the time.

694
00:39:41.246 --> 00:39:43.752
And my now ex-wife.

695
00:39:43.787 --> 00:39:47.657
we had moved into
this little trailer.
out in the country.

696
00:39:47.692 --> 00:39:49.527
We were freshly married.

697
00:39:49.562 --> 00:39:51.254
engaged. getting ready
to get married at the time.

698
00:39:51.289 --> 00:39:53.531
We got married.
right as we moved in.

699
00:39:53.566 --> 00:39:55.225
<i>And so it was our first.</i>

700
00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.699
<i>Our first place together.</i>

701
00:39:56.734 --> 00:39:59.097
<i>Moved in. it was peaceful</i>
<i>and affordable</i>

702
00:39:59.132 --> 00:40:02.001
<i>and we were young</i>
<i>and poor and didn't</i>
<i>have a lot of money then.</i>

703
00:40:02.036 --> 00:40:05.037
<i>So it. it was in our budget.</i>

704
00:40:05.072 --> 00:40:06.940
<i>And we had never...</i>

705
00:40:06.975 --> 00:40:10.438
<i>never had any inkling</i>
<i>going in there?</i>

706
00:40:10.473 --> 00:40:13.342
<i>There was none of that feeling</i>
<i>when we were</i>
<i>looking at the place.</i>

707
00:40:17.722 --> 00:40:20.316
<i>So I mean there.</i>
<i>there was a lot of history</i>
<i>through that area.</i>

708
00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:24.760
<i>but there was. no. there was...</i>
<i>There was slavery there.</i>
<i>there was Union occupation.</i>

709
00:40:24.795 --> 00:40:28.423
<i>Ah. you know. there was.</i>
<i>there was deaths in the area.</i>
<i>and it was very old.</i>

710
00:40:28.458 --> 00:40:31.932
<i>And it. it was Native American</i>
<i>land at one point in time. too.</i>

711
00:40:31.967 --> 00:40:35.936
<i>And we were.</i>
<i>we were settled in and...</i>

712
00:40:35.971 --> 00:40:39.940
<i>I'm guessing within.</i>
<i>like a month. things started</i>
<i>to get different.</i>

713
00:40:39.975 --> 00:40:44.472
<i>You had... During the day.</i>
<i>it was very peaceful</i>
<i>and serene.</i>

714
00:40:44.507 --> 00:40:47.277
<i>very rural. country setting.</i>

715
00:40:47.312 --> 00:40:51.050
<i>At night. from the time</i>
<i>the sun went down.</i>
<i>from dusk until about 4 a.m..</i>

716
00:40:51.085 --> 00:40:52.887
<i>there was just</i>
<i>this different vibe.</i>

717
00:40:52.922 --> 00:40:56.957
<i>And we would. ah...</i>

718
00:40:56.992 --> 00:40:58.629
<i>feel this different.</i>

719
00:40:58.664 --> 00:41:00.928
<i>You would just walk outside</i>
<i>and it would just initiate</i>

720
00:41:00.963 --> 00:41:03.997
<i>this extreme. instant</i>
<i>fight or flight response.</i>

721
00:41:04.032 --> 00:41:06.934
<i>Ah... mostly flight.</i>
<i>There was no fight</i>

722
00:41:06.969 --> 00:41:09.497
<i>and you just didn't</i>
<i>want to be out there.</i>

723
00:41:09.532 --> 00:41:16.240
Then. we would go into this...
start hearing noises
and scratches outside the house.

724
00:41:16.275 --> 00:41:19.045
You would see from the old
cemetery in homestead.

725
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.983
which was next
to where we lived.

726
00:41:23.018 --> 00:41:27.790
Ah. we started seeing red
glowing eyes. and they would be
seven to eight feet in the air.

727
00:41:27.825 --> 00:41:32.564
<i>And... the shadow that you've</i>
<i>seen was bipedal.</i>

728
00:41:32.599 --> 00:41:36.095
<i>and it almost looked like a...</i>
<i>like a giant canine.</i>

729
00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.934
<i>It didn't have any. you know.</i>
<i>human features to it.</i>

730
00:41:39.969 --> 00:41:43.971
<i>And seven to eight feet tall.</i>
<i>very broad shouldered.</i>

731
00:41:44.006 --> 00:41:49.713
<i>And it had this. had this...</i>
<i>canine-looking head to it.</i>

732
00:41:49.748 --> 00:41:53.508
<i>It didn't... you know.</i>
<i>it just did look</i>
<i>like a giant dog.</i>

733
00:41:53.543 --> 00:41:59.888
<i>And... the very first time</i>
<i>that I... that I heard.</i>
<i>heard anything. um...</i>

734
00:41:59.923 --> 00:42:03.661
<i>We had gone.</i>
<i>gone grocery shopping</i>
<i>on Friday night.</i>

735
00:42:03.696 --> 00:42:07.489
<i>gone out to eat. come home.</i>
<i>put everything away.</i>
<i>went to bed.</i>

736
00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:10.734
<i>And when we were lying in bed.</i>
<i>and this.</i>

737
00:42:10.769 --> 00:42:14.463
<i>this raking of claws</i>
<i>was going on. right outside</i>

738
00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:18.071
<i>outside of the house</i>
<i>in the bedroom.</i>

739
00:42:18.106 --> 00:42:23.978
<i>I just. I refused to go out.</i>
<i>We just rode it out.</i>
<i>let it go. and...</i>

740
00:42:24.013 --> 00:42:29.181
<i>We went out the next morning.</i>
<i>and the... from the area.</i>
<i>you could hear the noise</i>

741
00:42:29.216 --> 00:42:33.515
<i>from what's probably.</i>
<i>you know. seven to eight</i>
<i>feet up off the ground.</i>

742
00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.957
<i>And. and there were no</i>
<i>claw marks or anything.</i>

743
00:42:35.992 --> 00:42:39.323
<i>but we heard</i>
<i>definitely raking of claws.</i>
<i>the whole night long.</i>

744
00:42:39.358 --> 00:42:43.932
<i>And then shortly</i>
<i>after that. ah. we were.</i>
<i>we were in the kitchen</i>

745
00:42:43.967 --> 00:42:46.495
<i>and. and noticed</i>
<i>the glowing eyes</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

746
00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:49.366
<i>And then we stepped out</i>
<i>on the front to look and...</i>

747
00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:53.436
<i>And you could just see it</i>
<i>sitting there watching</i>
<i>and just observing us.</i>

748
00:42:53.471 --> 00:42:56.076
<i>And it would just do that</i>
<i>every once in a while.</i>

749
00:42:56.749 --> 00:42:59.508
<i>The. the most...</i>

750
00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:03.215
<i>The most common thing</i>
<i>that it did all the time</i>
<i>was this.</i>

751
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:08.055
<i>This energy that it put off.</i>
<i>it just inundated your senses</i>
<i>with instant fight or flight.</i>

752
00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:12.125
<i>And. and you could tell.</i>
<i>the sun went down</i>
<i>to about 4 a.m.</i>

753
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.293
<i>You just dealt with that.</i>
<i>And if you went</i>
<i>outside the house.</i>

754
00:43:15.328 --> 00:43:17.559
<i>it. it just overwhelmed you.</i>

755
00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:21.629
<i>It was very. it was the most</i>
<i>intense thing I've ever</i>
<i>experienced in my life.</i>

756
00:43:21.664 --> 00:43:26.073
<i>It would be. it didn't do this</i>
<i>every night. It would</i>
<i>be gone for a few days.</i>

757
00:43:26.108 --> 00:43:27.635
<i>and then it would come back.</i>

758
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:30.814
<i>And I don't know if we were</i>
<i>just on part of its route.</i>

759
00:43:30.849 --> 00:43:33.443
<i>and that whole area</i>
<i>was its territory.</i>

760
00:43:33.478 --> 00:43:39.823
<i>Ah. but every time...</i>
<i>we saw the eyes. it was always</i>
<i>in the old homestead</i>

761
00:43:39.858 --> 00:43:43.024
<i>at the old family cemetery.</i>
<i>It is where it always was.</i>

762
00:43:46.689 --> 00:43:51.230
<i>My now ex-wife. then she would</i>
<i>see things. And I traveled</i>
<i>for work. which I mostly do.</i>

763
00:43:51.265 --> 00:43:55.872
<i>And she had things happen</i>
<i>while I was at...</i>
<i>I was at work.</i>

764
00:43:55.907 --> 00:43:58.666
<i>And it was to the point</i>
<i>where she was like.</i>
<i>"We have to move.</i>

765
00:43:58.701 --> 00:44:00.338
<i>I can't do this anymore."</i>

766
00:44:00.373 --> 00:44:02.109
<i>So that's when</i>
<i>we decided to go.</i>

767
00:44:04.212 --> 00:44:06.751
<i>It was extremely peaceful.</i>

768
00:44:06.786 --> 00:44:08.984
<i>Other than that.</i>
<i>we didn't have anything.</i>

769
00:44:09.019 --> 00:44:12.988
<i>And that was the only issues</i>
<i>we had the whole time</i>
<i>we were there.</i>

770
00:44:13.023 --> 00:44:15.694
<i>But I mean. we lived there</i>
<i>six months and</i>
<i>it made us leave.</i>

771
00:44:16.686 --> 00:44:18.587
It was very odd.

772
00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:22.228
It was almost like it had
this ability to where it was...

773
00:44:23.968 --> 00:44:26.133
kind of real and then
kind of spiritual.

774
00:44:26.168 --> 00:44:29.774
Like it. it had some.
some physical attributes to it.

775
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:34.812
But. the rest of it seemed
very. very supernatural
and. and paranormal.

776
00:44:54.097 --> 00:44:56.691
<i>I was 18 when I had</i>
<i>my first encounter.</i>

777
00:44:56.726 --> 00:44:58.000
<i>I was in the Bell City swamp.</i>

778
00:44:58.035 --> 00:45:00.134
<i>I couldn't...</i>
<i>I used to hunt a lot.</i>

779
00:45:00.169 --> 00:45:03.566
<i>Every given night available.</i>
<i>I was out in the woods.</i>

780
00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:07.570
<i>And I had heard</i>
<i>about something</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

781
00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:10.177
<i>Eighteen. Stupid.</i>
<i>I wasn't scared much.</i>

782
00:45:10.212 --> 00:45:12.608
<i>Took my dogs out.</i>

783
00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:15.985
<i>We're having a good night.</i>
<i>We killed five coons</i>
<i>I think that night.</i>

784
00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:20.385
<i>We trailed a bobcat.</i>
<i>Just got off it.</i>

785
00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.519
<i>We went deeper.</i>
<i>about one in the morning.</i>

786
00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:26.897
<i>I should have known.</i>
<i>We didn't hear deer.</i>

787
00:45:26.932 --> 00:45:30.263
<i>We didn't see deer.</i>
<i>we didn't hear crickets.</i>

788
00:45:30.298 --> 00:45:33.332
<i>That's all signs</i>
<i>of big predators in the area.</i>
<i>I should have known.</i>

789
00:45:35.567 --> 00:45:37.908
<i>I had two dogs</i>
<i>come back out of three.</i>

790
00:45:37.943 --> 00:45:42.880
<i>And when I say two come back.</i>
<i>they howled past me</i>
<i>and didn't slow down.</i>

791
00:45:42.915 --> 00:45:45.674
<i>And these are trained coon</i>
<i>dogs. trained to stop.</i>

792
00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:50.514
<i>I was worried because</i>
<i>the one that was missing</i>
<i>was worth about $1500.</i>

793
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:52.285
<i>and she was my prize dog.</i>

794
00:45:53.255 --> 00:45:54.485
<i>So I went in looking.</i>

795
00:45:57.127 --> 00:45:58.588
<i>A smell hit me.</i>

796
00:46:01.296 --> 00:46:05.496
<i>I've been around dead animals.</i>
<i>I've been around carcasses.</i>
<i>I know what they smell like.</i>

797
00:46:07.269 --> 00:46:10.105
<i>It smelled like rotting meat</i>
<i>and a wet dog.</i>

798
00:46:11.944 --> 00:46:14.472
<i>The growl that coming out</i>
<i>of this animal...</i>

799
00:46:17.444 --> 00:46:19.081
<i>hit me in my bones.</i>

800
00:46:19.116 --> 00:46:22.183
<i>Just you won't forget it</i>
<i>if you could trust me.</i>

801
00:46:23.252 --> 00:46:25.956
<i>I had light touched my hat.</i>

802
00:46:25.991 --> 00:46:30.389
<i>When I flung it around.</i>
<i>I hit something in the eyes</i>

803
00:46:30.424 --> 00:46:33.458
<i>that was standing seven</i>
<i>and a half feet off the ground</i>
<i>at the eyes.</i>

804
00:46:34.494 --> 00:46:38.166
<i>Black fur... Head like a wolf.</i>

805
00:46:38.201 --> 00:46:39.530
<i>Plenty of hairs on top.</i>

806
00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:42.170
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what I was looking at.</i>

807
00:46:43.668 --> 00:46:45.701
<i>Here I am</i>
<i>on the double-barrel 20 gauge.</i>

808
00:46:46.605 --> 00:46:47.846
<i>I'm outgunned.</i>
<i>I know it.</i>

809
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:50.343
<i>I eased away...</i>

810
00:46:51.984 --> 00:46:53.808
<i>backwards. trying to</i>
<i>get away from it...</i>

811
00:46:54.877 --> 00:46:58.747
<i>and... it stepped off.</i>

812
00:46:58.782 --> 00:47:01.783
<i>like it didn't want</i>
<i>to be in the light.</i>

813
00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:03.323
<i>I tried to keep my eye on it.</i>

814
00:47:05.162 --> 00:47:07.690
<i>And it was gone.</i>

815
00:47:07.725 --> 00:47:11.298
<i>I've never seen anything</i>
<i>move that quick. I mean.</i>
<i>it was there. It's gone.</i>

816
00:47:11.333 --> 00:47:13.201
I took off for the truck.

817
00:47:13.236 --> 00:47:15.907
And when I got back.
the truck was facing the woods.

818
00:47:17.273 --> 00:47:18.569
My dogs went back.

819
00:47:19.473 --> 00:47:22.474
They beat me to the truck.

820
00:47:22.509 --> 00:47:27.545
When I turned the headlights on
to turn the truck around.
it was standing in the edge.

821
00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.921
Like it had followed me up
until I left.

822
00:47:29.956 --> 00:47:33.155
<i>I've been around enough animals</i>
<i>to know if it's got claws</i>

823
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:36.224
<i>and it's got teeth</i>
<i>shaped like that.</i>
<i>It. it don't eat plants.</i>

824
00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:40.393
<i>It's got big canine teeth.</i>
<i>and it's got big. sharp claws.</i>

825
00:47:40.428 --> 00:47:43.165
<i>It did not go around</i>
<i>munching on blackberries.</i>

826
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:47.202
<i>My blue tip coon hound</i>
<i>found a bloody car.</i>

827
00:47:47.237 --> 00:47:51.437
<i>And it was cut in three places.</i>
<i>and it was</i>
<i>a solid leather strap.</i>

828
00:47:54.574 --> 00:47:55.705
Two years ago...

829
00:47:57.082 --> 00:47:58.906
the last encounter I had.

830
00:47:58.941 --> 00:48:02.448
and the one that literally
made me sell my dogs
and quit coon hunting.

831
00:48:04.551 --> 00:48:05.990
Dad called me.

832
00:48:06.025 --> 00:48:07.354
Wants me to train a couple pups.

833
00:48:08.819 --> 00:48:11.061
The problem. I've done
it all my life.

834
00:48:11.096 --> 00:48:12.854
Okay. Run them over.

835
00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:14.559
You run it out.
Run them tonight.

836
00:48:15.265 --> 00:48:17.430
We started out.

837
00:48:17.465 --> 00:48:21.104
I had old black and tan
and an old red bone.

838
00:48:22.536 --> 00:48:24.305
<i>And Dad had his</i>
<i>two little pups.</i>

839
00:48:25.638 --> 00:48:27.737
<i>Dad didn't wanna go that night.</i>

840
00:48:27.772 --> 00:48:29.981
<i>That's fine. I'll take him.</i>

841
00:48:30.016 --> 00:48:33.017
<i>It started out great.</i>
<i>I mean Bella hit.</i>

842
00:48:33.052 --> 00:48:36.548
<i>My black and tan.</i>
<i>she had a trail on me.</i>

843
00:48:36.583 --> 00:48:41.190
<i>We're off. we're both</i>
<i>trying to look for the ball.</i>

844
00:48:41.225 --> 00:48:46.954
That little bit of red bone
that he had on a
section of horse jaw.

845
00:48:46.989 --> 00:48:51.134
I'm guessing around 6-8 inches.

846
00:48:51.169 --> 00:48:52.168
<i>Had teeth in it.</i>

847
00:48:53.798 --> 00:48:57.371
<i>I felt that was kind of funny.</i>
<i>No feelings.</i>

848
00:48:57.406 --> 00:49:01.507
<i>I thought it was...</i>
<i>so I followed him.</i>
<i>I come look...</i>

849
00:49:02.147 --> 00:49:03.146
<i>on...</i>

850
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:07.876
<i>I think it was</i>
<i>a whole skeleton.</i>

851
00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:12.650
<i>The bones were some</i>
<i>chewed up and mutilated.</i>

852
00:49:12.685 --> 00:49:17.127
<i>I could make out a skull.</i>
<i>the pelvis. some ribs.</i>
<i>and the fingers.</i>

853
00:49:18.328 --> 00:49:21.824
And the skull
was in about 33. 34 pieces.

854
00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.200
That put me on alert.

855
00:49:25.368 --> 00:49:28.798
But. predators
tear up bones.

856
00:49:28.833 --> 00:49:32.637
No big deal. Coyote's chew them.
squirrels chew them. calcium.

857
00:49:32.672 --> 00:49:35.178
<i>Pups wouldn't listen.</i>
<i>I wanted to go back.</i>

858
00:49:35.213 --> 00:49:37.906
<i>I was not tired for the night.</i>
<i>anyways. They didn't quit.</i>

859
00:49:39.184 --> 00:49:40.744
<i>My big dog</i>
<i>was still on a trail.</i>

860
00:49:40.779 --> 00:49:45.089
<i>She wouldn't cut off.</i>
<i>so I had to go in at him.</i>

861
00:49:45.124 --> 00:49:50.358
<i>Even farther and farther</i>
<i>I went. the more bones I found.</i>

862
00:49:50.393 --> 00:49:53.955
<i>And. I come upon the pups</i>
<i>and they were just laying</i>
<i>on the ground.</i>

863
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.989
Flat. Just...

864
00:49:57.103 --> 00:50:03.371
<i>Wouldn't move...</i>
<i>The dog was between me</i>
<i>and something in front of me.</i>

865
00:50:04.374 --> 00:50:06.968
Growling. Bristled up.

866
00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:10.378
<i>Snarling. acting like</i>
<i>I've never seen her act.</i>

867
00:50:10.413 --> 00:50:12.677
The growl that I heard
that night...

868
00:50:13.581 --> 00:50:14.877
It was like you could feel it.

869
00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.914
It was. it came from its gut.

870
00:50:27.463 --> 00:50:29.166
<i>I was 15 yards from it.</i>

871
00:50:30.367 --> 00:50:32.026
<i>It was massive.</i>

872
00:50:35.405 --> 00:50:37.405
<i>I was close enough</i>
<i>when he could.</i>

873
00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.078
<i>when he'd sniff. you could</i>
<i>see his nose wrinkle up.</i>

874
00:50:41.741 --> 00:50:43.708
<i>That's way too close.</i>

875
00:50:44.909 --> 00:50:46.546
<i>Way too close.</i>

876
00:50:46.581 --> 00:50:49.076
<i>I've always been told.</i>
<i>like most kids</i>
<i>in Southern areas.</i>

877
00:50:49.111 --> 00:50:52.849
<i>"Be careful. there's Panthers</i>
<i>in the woods and..."</i>

878
00:50:52.884 --> 00:50:55.489
<i>I mean. this is Western</i>
<i>Kentucky. We don't have bear.</i>

879
00:50:55.524 --> 00:50:58.888
<i>but every now and then.</i>
<i>because they wander up</i>
<i>out of Tennessee. but...</i>

880
00:50:58.923 --> 00:51:02.661
<i>I've faced predators.</i>

881
00:51:02.696 --> 00:51:07.600
<i>most of your big game predators</i>
<i>that you have in the States.</i>

882
00:51:07.635 --> 00:51:11.439
<i>These things don't act</i>
<i>like that. You look</i>
<i>in these thing's eyes.</i>

883
00:51:11.474 --> 00:51:13.903
<i>These things look like they're</i>
<i>trying to figure you out.</i>

884
00:51:13.938 --> 00:51:16.939
<i>They look like they're looking</i>
<i>through you. trying to figure</i>
<i>out what your next move is</i>

885
00:51:18.283 --> 00:51:19.447
<i>so they can get around it.</i>

886
00:51:22.045 --> 00:51:24.221
<i>I've been around predators</i>
<i>my whole life.</i>

887
00:51:24.256 --> 00:51:28.258
<i>and I've never seen anything</i>
<i>in my life like that.</i>

888
00:51:28.293 --> 00:51:31.327
<i>I've never seen anything</i>
<i>look like it had</i>
<i>enough consciousness</i>

889
00:51:31.362 --> 00:51:32.988
<i>to know what you might do.</i>

890
00:51:35.663 --> 00:51:37.828
<i>I think that scares me</i>
<i>as much as seeing them.</i>

891
00:51:40.162 --> 00:51:41.436
<i>This one wasn't scared.</i>

892
00:51:42.868 --> 00:51:44.208
<i>This one wasn't curious.</i>

893
00:51:46.674 --> 00:51:49.037
<i>This one did not want me there.</i>

894
00:51:49.072 --> 00:51:54.284
<i>You would come up closer.</i>

895
00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:58.618
<i>When I cooned. I carried</i>
<i>a double-barrel</i> 410
<i>and a double-barrel 20 gauge.</i>

896
00:51:58.653 --> 00:52:01.522
<i>Double-barreled 410.</i>
<i>Double-hammered old gun.</i>

897
00:52:02.228 --> 00:52:04.591
<i>And a .357 pistol.</i>

898
00:52:04.626 --> 00:52:07.759
<i>The fact that my coon dog</i>
<i>never moved</i>

899
00:52:07.794 --> 00:52:09.530
<i>didn't even faze this animal.</i>

900
00:52:11.666 --> 00:52:13.798
<i>She might as well been</i>
<i>to a piss and come along now.</i>

901
00:52:14.768 --> 00:52:15.998
<i>It walked...</i>

902
00:52:17.837 --> 00:52:21.069
<i>In a semi-circle around me</i>
<i>like a predatory move would.</i>

903
00:52:23.447 --> 00:52:26.877
<i>At this point.</i>
<i>I pretty much know.</i>

904
00:52:26.912 --> 00:52:29.110
<i>It came over. done.</i>

905
00:52:32.522 --> 00:52:36.623
<i>He got three quarter</i>
<i>of the way around me...</i>

906
00:52:36.658 --> 00:52:41.694
<i>in the loudest. deepest howl</i>
<i>I've ever heard that come from</i>
<i>deeper in the swamp.</i>

907
00:52:44.226 --> 00:52:45.797
<i>His ears perked up.</i>

908
00:52:48.032 --> 00:52:51.407
<i>And it was like I wasn't</i>
<i>even there at that point.</i>

909
00:52:51.442 --> 00:52:52.705
<i>He held back.</i>

910
00:52:55.072 --> 00:52:58.909
<i>He acknowledged me</i>
<i>by roaring at me so loud.</i>
<i>I ain't even gonna lie.</i>

911
00:53:00.913 --> 00:53:04.288
<i>I pissed my pants that night.</i>
<i>It scared me so bad.</i>

912
00:53:05.588 --> 00:53:07.324
<i>So I just threw the shotgun up.</i>

913
00:53:07.359 --> 00:53:11.361
<i>Well. at least</i>
<i>I might get blood.</i>

914
00:53:11.396 --> 00:53:16.663
<i>When I threw the barrels up.</i>
<i>he cleared the bushes</i>
<i>behind him that were probably</i>

915
00:53:16.698 --> 00:53:19.699
six. seven foot... and was gone.

916
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:21.635
Foot towards the hell.

917
00:53:23.573 --> 00:53:26.871
I come home that night.
I sold 17 dogs the next morning.

918
00:53:29.447 --> 00:53:32.382
I sold all my gear
except my coon hunting light.

919
00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:37.321
And the only time I go out now
in the dark. if I'm hunting

920
00:53:37.356 --> 00:53:39.521
is if I'm around ponds
and hunting frogs.

921
00:53:40.557 --> 00:53:42.557
I do not go near
that swamp at night.

922
00:53:42.592 --> 00:53:44.559
I'll go during the day.

923
00:53:44.594 --> 00:53:46.528
I will not go at night.

924
00:53:46.563 --> 00:53:49.828
The reason I wanted to stay
anonymous is I've had people
tell me I'm crazy.

925
00:53:49.863 --> 00:53:51.093
I've had people tell me...

926
00:53:52.261 --> 00:53:55.031
I'm drinking too much.
doing drugs.

927
00:53:56.298 --> 00:53:57.440
Lyin'.

928
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.903
No.

929
00:53:59.609 --> 00:54:01.345
They're real.

930
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:03.006
Science might
not have found them. But...

931
00:54:04.779 --> 00:54:05.811
don't mean nothing.

932
00:54:07.045 --> 00:54:08.484
They stay hidden for a reason.

933
00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:20.056
<i>My name is Martin Groves.</i>

934
00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:27.195
<i>I had an incident in the 1990s</i>
<i>spring turkey season.</i>

935
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:29.736
<i>that kind of connected me</i>
<i>to the area.</i>

936
00:54:29.771 --> 00:54:32.772
<i>I'm a retired police officer</i>
<i>of 32 years.</i>

937
00:54:32.807 --> 00:54:35.808
<i>I've been with a local.</i>
<i>rural sheriff's department</i>

938
00:54:35.843 --> 00:54:38.811
of which I have now
since retired.

939
00:54:38.846 --> 00:54:42.111
Uh. but I was
with the department
for many years.

940
00:54:42.146 --> 00:54:48.656
and a uniformed patrol officer.
Coming from a... a...
a police background.

941
00:54:48.691 --> 00:54:52.121
ah. it's going to ruffle
a lot of... a lot of feathers.

942
00:54:52.156 --> 00:54:56.664
<i>The only reason why I've even</i>
<i>come forward at this point</i>
<i>is one. I have retired.</i>

943
00:54:56.699 --> 00:55:01.438
<i>and I don't really care</i>
<i>what people think of me</i>
<i>or what will be said.</i>

944
00:55:01.473 --> 00:55:03.968
<i>I feel like there is something</i>
<i>within that park...</i>

945
00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:08.335
<i>animal or beast.</i>

946
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:11.305
<i>that is a danger to the public.</i>

947
00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:16.849
<i>I was told that this would be</i>
<i>very detrimental to any tourism</i>

948
00:55:16.884 --> 00:55:21.150
and to anything that
any public reports coming out

949
00:55:21.185 --> 00:55:23.922
that there was any kind
of animals eating people.

950
00:55:23.957 --> 00:55:26.155
Or attacking people
within the park.

951
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:29.224
And there has been a long time.

952
00:55:29.259 --> 00:55:32.964
<i>standing. unwritten rule</i>

953
00:55:32.999 --> 00:55:40.004
<i>that they control the reports</i>
<i>that come outside the parks</i>
<i>because of this.</i>

954
00:55:40.039 --> 00:55:43.876
In the '70s.
there was a group of kids

955
00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:46.615
that disappeared up there.
then Land Between the Lakes.

956
00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:48.650
<i>They heard a bunch</i>
<i>of screaming and...</i>

957
00:55:48.685 --> 00:55:50.850
<i>when the other group</i>
<i>came up to them.</i>

958
00:55:50.885 --> 00:55:53.050
<i>they disappeared.</i>
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

959
00:55:53.085 --> 00:55:58.528
<i>1979. That was over</i>
<i>around Willow Bay.</i>
<i>the members bay area.</i>

960
00:55:58.563 --> 00:56:01.729
<i>There was a gentleman.</i>
<i>He worked in</i>
<i>Kentucky Fish and Game.</i>

961
00:56:01.764 --> 00:56:06.393
<i>He said that he witnessed</i>
<i>a Dogman jump on a couple</i>
<i>that was camping there</i>

962
00:56:06.428 --> 00:56:08.065
<i>along the shoreline.</i>

963
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:10.474
<i>held them down with its hands</i>
<i>and biting plugs out of them.</i>

964
00:56:10.509 --> 00:56:14.907
<i>and they were able</i>
<i>to confirm his employment</i>
<i>through the state and what not.</i>

965
00:56:14.942 --> 00:56:20.682
<i>Ah. you got the famed 1982</i>
<i>attack of the family that was</i>
<i>slaughtered very terrible.</i>

966
00:56:20.717 --> 00:56:25.885
There's multiple variations
of the story. but largely
they have retained the same way.

967
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.284
So that story boiled down
to its most basic form.

968
00:56:29.319 --> 00:56:31.957
is a family of four.
came down to the Land
Between the Lakes.

969
00:56:31.992 --> 00:56:34.894
They were either
in a travel trailer or an RV.

970
00:56:34.929 --> 00:56:37.930
<i>And they came down</i>
<i>to do some camping</i>
<i>up at the northern end</i>

971
00:56:37.965 --> 00:56:40.295
<i>of Land Between the Lakes.</i>
<i>while they were. I guess.</i>

972
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:42.297
<i>getting set up</i>
<i>and everything ready.</i>

973
00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:46.400
<i>A Dogman came up</i>
<i>and literally</i>
<i>slaughtered the family.</i>

974
00:56:50.307 --> 00:56:53.275
<i>Just dispatched them</i>
<i>in a grisly manner.</i>

975
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:56.916
<i>People came back</i>
<i>through. cops. ah...</i>

976
00:56:56.951 --> 00:57:01.657
<i>The government in some form.</i>
<i>hikers and they found</i>
<i>the family dead.</i>

977
00:57:01.692 --> 00:57:04.220
<i>They found three bodies.</i>
<i>but they couldn't</i>
<i>find the little girl.</i>

978
00:57:04.255 --> 00:57:06.354
<i>Anyway. there was a little girl</i>
<i>along with them.</i>

979
00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:09.456
<i>And they eventually found her</i>
<i>either up in the top of a tree</i>

980
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:12.635
or somewhere about
100 feet away from the RV.

981
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:15.132
There is a little bit
of contention on that.

982
00:57:15.167 --> 00:57:19.004
It has become a famous story
of the region. now almost
teetering on urban legend.

983
00:57:19.039 --> 00:57:21.809
And you can even find evidence
that it happened because

984
00:57:21.844 --> 00:57:24.372
<i>the spot where</i>
<i>it allegedly took place.</i>

985
00:57:24.407 --> 00:57:28.475
<i>you can find where</i>
<i>the light poles</i>
<i>are cut even to the ground.</i>

986
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:30.587
<i>You can find the old RV slips.</i>

987
00:57:30.622 --> 00:57:33.656
<i>You can find</i>
<i>the old foundations</i>
<i>for the bathhouses.</i>

988
00:57:33.691 --> 00:57:36.153
<i>Something seemed to</i>
<i>have taken place there.</i>

989
00:57:36.188 --> 00:57:38.793
<i>You can find the old.</i>
<i>the boundary stakes.</i>

990
00:57:38.828 --> 00:57:41.389
<i>It really looks like</i>
<i>something happened.</i>

991
00:57:41.424 --> 00:57:42.456
<i>And then...</i>

992
00:57:43.635 --> 00:57:46.999
some government crew
or the park came in.

993
00:57:47.034 --> 00:57:49.397
tore it all up
and let nature retake itself.

994
00:57:51.907 --> 00:57:57.207
You can tell that. for once
some reason they wanted
to do away with this area.

995
00:57:57.242 --> 00:58:00.309
And that. that's the most
famous story from up there.

996
00:58:00.344 --> 00:58:03.950
The next famous would
probably be. there was
a bow hunter up there

997
00:58:03.985 --> 00:58:07.151
whose body was found dead
and I haven't found them yet.

998
00:58:07.186 --> 00:58:10.924
<i>But supposedly there are</i>
<i>documents showing</i>
<i>he was found in the park.</i>

999
00:58:10.959 --> 00:58:13.696
<i>He was dead.</i>
<i>It was all factual.</i>

1000
00:58:13.731 --> 00:58:16.699
<i>When they found his body</i>
<i>in a soybean field over</i>

1001
00:58:16.734 --> 00:58:19.636
<i>around where we camp</i>
<i>a lot. Dark Hollow.</i>

1002
00:58:19.671 --> 00:58:20.901
<i>His body was fed upon.</i>

1003
00:58:24.104 --> 00:58:27.611
I'm going to be very respectful
because of the family

1004
00:58:27.646 --> 00:58:29.580
that. uh. suffered a loss.

1005
00:58:30.242 --> 00:58:31.472
A hunter was killed...

1006
00:58:32.442 --> 00:58:34.475
and was mauled to death.

1007
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:39.183
But the official report says
it was a unknown animal.

1008
00:58:39.218 --> 00:58:40.558
<i>Unknown species.</i>

1009
00:58:41.418 --> 00:58:43.693
<i>The reports...</i>

1010
00:58:43.728 --> 00:58:46.993
<i>that I have read.</i>
<i>and what I have been told</i>

1011
00:58:47.028 --> 00:58:51.030
<i>is that the animal</i>
<i>was either a cougar or a bear.</i>

1012
00:58:51.065 --> 00:58:53.230
<i>that had ripped</i>
<i>the man out of his tent.</i>

1013
00:58:53.265 --> 00:58:56.002
<i>And had consumed him</i>
<i>and pulled his body</i>

1014
00:58:56.037 --> 00:58:58.906
<i>three to four hundred</i>
<i>yards away from the tent.</i>

1015
00:58:58.941 --> 00:59:04.241
It is my belief that I actually
had met this man the day before

1016
00:59:04.276 --> 00:59:07.145
while I was out
and was scouting.

1017
00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:09.213
And I do not know
if it was or not.

1018
00:59:09.248 --> 00:59:14.053
<i>I do know</i>
<i>that the man that I met was</i>
<i>in the same immediate area.</i>

1019
00:59:14.088 --> 00:59:16.660
<i>and I observed</i>
<i>his pickup truck.</i>

1020
00:59:16.695 --> 00:59:20.026
<i>And there's just too many</i>
<i>indications to me</i>
<i>that I believe</i>

1021
00:59:20.061 --> 00:59:21.698
<i>that the man that I met</i>

1022
00:59:21.733 --> 00:59:24.261
<i>is the same man</i>
<i>that was pulled out</i>
<i>of his tent and eaten.</i>

1023
00:59:28.003 --> 00:59:31.708
One of the common things
when you're researching
Dogman is. it is strange.

1024
00:59:31.743 --> 00:59:33.138
Toward the northern end
of the parks

1025
00:59:33.173 --> 00:59:35.536
<i>where they are at.</i>
<i>you'll find Dogman activity.</i>

1026
00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:37.879
<i>But to the southern end.</i>
<i>you find Bigfoot activity.</i>

1027
00:59:37.914 --> 00:59:40.607
<i>Dogmen in the North.</i>
<i>Bigfoot in the South.</i>

1028
00:59:40.642 --> 00:59:45.051
<i>So it does seem</i>
<i>in some ways. there is a.</i>
<i>a territorial aspect to it.</i>

1029
00:59:45.086 --> 00:59:49.286
<i>I don't know. It could be</i>
<i>hungry. aggressive predator.</i>
<i>could be territory.</i>

1030
00:59:49.321 --> 00:59:51.662
<i>Ah. there's a lot of factors</i>
<i>that could be at play.</i>

1031
00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:58.262
In the spring of.
I believe it was 1993-94.

1032
00:59:58.297 --> 01:00:02.233
a hunting partner and myself...

1033
01:00:02.268 --> 01:00:05.104
A friend that I actually worked
at the sheriff's office with.

1034
01:00:05.139 --> 01:00:07.909
had decided to take a trip

1035
01:00:07.944 --> 01:00:10.439
into Land Between the Lakes
for turkey hunting.

1036
01:00:11.277 --> 01:00:12.749
<i>The first night we came in.</i>

1037
01:00:12.784 --> 01:00:16.643
<i>we had absolutely</i>
<i>no problems whatsoever.</i>

1038
01:00:16.678 --> 01:00:21.285
<i>The next day. we both got up</i>
<i>and decided to take</i>

1039
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:25.421
<i>a small excursion.</i>
<i>searching for birds.</i>

1040
01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:27.764
<i>and we went our separate ways.</i>

1041
01:00:27.799 --> 01:00:32.901
<i>We had a very nice</i>
<i>game trail to follow.</i>

1042
01:00:32.936 --> 01:00:36.905
<i>and I followed for miles</i>
<i>and throughout the entire day.</i>

1043
01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.842
<i>At this point</i>
<i>in the late afternoon.</i>

1044
01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:43.813
<i>I had a...</i>

1045
01:00:43.848 --> 01:00:48.411
feeling that I was being
followed inside the woods.

1046
01:00:48.446 --> 01:00:50.985
Behind me I could hear movement.

1047
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.449
and I could feel a presence

1048
01:00:53.484 --> 01:00:57.651
that I did not know if it was
animal or if it was man.

1049
01:00:57.686 --> 01:01:01.127
<i>Being an avid hunter.</i>
<i>I was very observant.</i>

1050
01:01:01.162 --> 01:01:03.932
<i>Two to 300 yards behind me.</i>

1051
01:01:03.967 --> 01:01:05.296
<i>on the trail behind me.</i>

1052
01:01:05.331 --> 01:01:07.870
<i>I could see</i>
<i>movement in the woods.</i>

1053
01:01:07.905 --> 01:01:11.038
<i>I continued through</i>
<i>the woods for some time.</i>

1054
01:01:11.073 --> 01:01:15.878
<i>and followed the game trail.</i>
<i>edging my way back to my camp.</i>

1055
01:01:15.913 --> 01:01:19.376
<i>When I did actually</i>
<i>catch movement in the woods</i>

1056
01:01:19.411 --> 01:01:20.784
<i>and I could see</i>

1057
01:01:20.819 --> 01:01:23.952
<i>that there was two.</i>
<i>or possibly three animals</i>

1058
01:01:23.987 --> 01:01:26.823
<i>that was tailing me.</i>
<i>but when I would stop.</i>

1059
01:01:26.858 --> 01:01:29.188
<i>the movement would stop</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

1060
01:01:29.223 --> 01:01:30.717
<i>I continued on.</i>

1061
01:01:30.752 --> 01:01:33.027
<i>and as I've become closer</i>
<i>to my camp.</i>

1062
01:01:34.591 --> 01:01:39.495
<i>I could hear</i>
<i>a distinct knock in the woods.</i>

1063
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:44.874
<i>and it would be a large boom.</i>

1064
01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:49.571
like someone had taken an axe
or something up against a tree.

1065
01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:53.542
So. at that point. I believed
it was my hunting partner

1066
01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:55.610
and I was getting
closer to camp.

1067
01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:58.052
As I got closer to camp.

1068
01:01:58.087 --> 01:02:02.518
<i>is when I first observed</i>
<i>what I believe to be</i>

1069
01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:06.324
<i>a man in a ghillie suit.</i>

1070
01:02:06.359 --> 01:02:07.864
<i>So I just wrote it off.</i>

1071
01:02:07.899 --> 01:02:10.559
<i>you know.</i>
<i>I'm a. I'm on a hot trail.</i>

1072
01:02:10.594 --> 01:02:12.561
I just need to get back to camp.

1073
01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:15.597
Somebody is watching me
to the west of me.

1074
01:02:15.632 --> 01:02:18.402
and somebody's coming in
on a game trail behind me

1075
01:02:18.437 --> 01:02:20.437
<i>that's an animal.</i>

1076
01:02:20.472 --> 01:02:22.472
<i>Something was just tagging me.</i>

1077
01:02:23.882 --> 01:02:25.882
<i>I finally did make it</i>
<i>back to camp.</i>

1078
01:02:25.917 --> 01:02:30.315
<i>The closer I began getting</i>
<i>to my camp. I heard whistles.</i>

1079
01:02:31.857 --> 01:02:33.747
<i>I could hear a whistle</i>

1080
01:02:33.782 --> 01:02:38.620
<i>that was human-like.</i>
<i>that was a shrill whistle.</i>

1081
01:02:38.655 --> 01:02:40.930
<i>I attributed</i>
<i>a lot of these things</i>

1082
01:02:40.965 --> 01:02:43.966
<i>to. 'this is my hunting partner</i>
<i>back in camp.'</i>

1083
01:02:44.001 --> 01:02:45.902
'He's knocking something.'

1084
01:02:45.937 --> 01:02:48.905
'He's whistling.
trying to get me to come in.

1085
01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.797
'so. I came in to camp.'

1086
01:02:50.832 --> 01:02:53.140
And immediately
when I come in to camp.

1087
01:02:53.175 --> 01:02:55.945
my friend that I have known
for many years.

1088
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.738
I could tell was very shook.

1089
01:02:57.773 --> 01:03:01.742
There was something not right
with my hunting partner.

1090
01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:04.316
and I said. look. I'm sorry
I've been gone.

1091
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:08.320
He said. "It's not that. I was
a little bit worried about you.

1092
01:03:08.355 --> 01:03:12.192
<i>"but there is something</i>
<i>around the camp".</i>

1093
01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:16.064
<i>That's when he broke down</i>
<i>and told me.</i>

1094
01:03:16.099 --> 01:03:18.000
<i>he said.</i>
<i>"I've been hearing whistles</i>

1095
01:03:18.035 --> 01:03:22.499
<i>and there is something</i>
<i>hitting a tree.</i>

1096
01:03:22.534 --> 01:03:27.977
<i>or there is maybe rocks being</i>
<i>clampered against the ground.</i>

1097
01:03:28.012 --> 01:03:30.474
<i>He did not know either.</i>

1098
01:03:30.509 --> 01:03:32.982
<i>We settled in.</i>
<i>we talked around the campfire.</i>

1099
01:03:33.017 --> 01:03:36.183
<i>It got dark at this point.</i>

1100
01:03:36.218 --> 01:03:39.021
<i>When it gets dark</i>
<i>at Land Between the Lakes.</i>

1101
01:03:39.056 --> 01:03:41.485
<i>it is dark.</i>

1102
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.125
<i>There's no car lights.</i>
<i>there's no street lights.</i>

1103
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:47.557
<i>It is as if you were</i>
<i>in the 1700 or 1800s.</i>

1104
01:03:50.496 --> 01:03:52.463
<i>We felt like we were</i>
<i>being pressured</i>

1105
01:03:52.498 --> 01:03:54.465
<i>to get out of the camp.</i>

1106
01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:57.270
<i>and this is</i>
<i>when the activity began.</i>

1107
01:03:57.305 --> 01:03:59.833
<i>All that was illuminated.</i>
<i>was our campfire.</i>

1108
01:04:00.572 --> 01:04:02.880
<i>and our kerosene lamp.</i>

1109
01:04:03.872 --> 01:04:05.674
<i>So we had a period of...</i>

1110
01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:09.546
<i>a distance</i>
<i>of 15 to 20 feet at maximum</i>

1111
01:04:09.581 --> 01:04:11.449
<i>around the camp</i>
<i>that would be illuminated.</i>

1112
01:04:11.484 --> 01:04:14.023
<i>and then we would see shadows.</i>

1113
01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:19.490
<i>And I noticed what I believed</i>
<i>to be a man behind a tree.</i>

1114
01:04:19.525 --> 01:04:22.856
<i>It looked as if a person</i>
<i>was standing behind the tree.</i>

1115
01:04:22.891 --> 01:04:24.396
<i>very large tree.</i>

1116
01:04:24.431 --> 01:04:26.101
At that point.
we were locked in.

1117
01:04:26.136 --> 01:04:29.797
We were not going to be made
to move by anything or anybody.

1118
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:32.140
This was our camp.

1119
01:04:32.175 --> 01:04:34.175
We're staying
and we're gonna hunt here.

1120
01:04:35.937 --> 01:04:40.742
<i>A small limb or tree.</i>
<i>piece of a tree</i>

1121
01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:43.316
<i>come flying off</i>
<i>the top of the cliff</i>

1122
01:04:43.351 --> 01:04:45.285
<i>that was raised above us.</i>

1123
01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:47.518
The rock came.

1124
01:04:47.553 --> 01:04:51.225
and when the rock comes
so close to in between us.

1125
01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:54.426
we were standing within
five to ten foot of each other.

1126
01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:58.760
we started getting scared.

1127
01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:04.139
At one point.
Harry told me that...

1128
01:05:04.174 --> 01:05:07.076
maybe we should get
our firearms.

1129
01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:11.410
and. so he set his shotgun
closer to him.

1130
01:05:11.445 --> 01:05:14.215
My shotgun was laying
on the ground.

1131
01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:17.614
but I had a sidearm on me.

1132
01:05:17.649 --> 01:05:19.451
So. I kind of felt confident.

1133
01:05:22.555 --> 01:05:26.524
<i>You have to imagine</i>
<i>the darkness and</i>
<i>how dark that it was.</i>

1134
01:05:26.559 --> 01:05:29.263
<i>and how limited</i>
<i>vision was for us.</i>

1135
01:05:32.532 --> 01:05:34.862
<i>We began to get a growl</i>

1136
01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:38.932
<i>from where the person</i>
<i>or persons were standing.</i>

1137
01:05:38.967 --> 01:05:44.377
The growl was so intense.
that it vibrated in my chest.

1138
01:05:44.412 --> 01:05:46.445
and within my partner's chest.

1139
01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.151
It was like a vibration.

1140
01:05:49.186 --> 01:05:52.055
It was not like a growl
I had ever heard
in my life from...

1141
01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:53.947
I've been around bears.

1142
01:05:53.982 --> 01:05:57.027
I've been around
pigs. charging boars.

1143
01:05:57.062 --> 01:06:00.195
I've been around
all different kinds of animals.

1144
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:02.857
This was a growl
like I had never heard.

1145
01:06:04.465 --> 01:06:07.994
All my life. I've been trained
not to be afraid.

1146
01:06:08.029 --> 01:06:12.372
I've been trained to attack
anything that comes into vision

1147
01:06:12.407 --> 01:06:14.770
if you perceive it
to be a danger.

1148
01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:18.004
I could not do anything.
It just is...

1149
01:06:18.039 --> 01:06:21.744
<i>It was as if I was this child</i>
<i>and I was five years old.</i>

1150
01:06:21.779 --> 01:06:24.054
<i>and I was scared</i>
<i>of a monster in the dark.</i>

1151
01:06:24.089 --> 01:06:30.852
<i>and I noticed that my partner</i>
<i>was totally frozen.</i>

1152
01:06:30.887 --> 01:06:32.491
<i>He was not moving.</i>

1153
01:06:32.526 --> 01:06:34.163
He was breathing fast.

1154
01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:38.266
At one point
I've seen his shoulders slump.

1155
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:41.830
and he was not feeling well.

1156
01:06:42.701 --> 01:06:45.306
<i>All time had frozen.</i>

1157
01:06:45.341 --> 01:06:49.640
<i>Everything had just...</i>
<i>like it had become stilled.</i>

1158
01:06:49.675 --> 01:06:56.350
<i>and it It was just a low.</i>
<i>intense feeling that I had.</i>

1159
01:06:56.385 --> 01:07:00.222
<i>Out of the left side</i>
<i>of my peripheral vision.</i>

1160
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:03.126
<i>I saw movement.</i>

1161
01:07:03.161 --> 01:07:07.394
<i>At this point</i>
<i>I made a physical move.</i>

1162
01:07:07.429 --> 01:07:09.660
and once I took a step.

1163
01:07:09.695 --> 01:07:13.268
I felt like I could...
I just gained. like. my freedom.

1164
01:07:15.371 --> 01:07:16.931
and I pulled my firearm.

1165
01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:20.033
I turned my shoulders
to face the object

1166
01:07:20.068 --> 01:07:23.080
that I caught
in my peripheral vision.

1167
01:07:24.149 --> 01:07:27.007
I faced... I looked forward.

1168
01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:31.682
and I could see
what I knew was not a man.

1169
01:07:31.717 --> 01:07:36.258
<i>I knew that it was not</i>
<i>an animal I had ever seen.</i>

1170
01:07:37.558 --> 01:07:40.229
<i>and it was coming towards me.</i>

1171
01:07:40.264 --> 01:07:42.957
<i>In the glow of the campfire</i>

1172
01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:46.499
<i>and the glow</i>
<i>of my kerosene lamp.</i>

1173
01:07:46.534 --> 01:07:51.768
<i>I caught what I felt</i>
<i>was an upright walking...</i>

1174
01:07:51.803 --> 01:07:55.068
<i>It was not bear.</i>
<i>It was like a wolf.</i>

1175
01:07:55.103 --> 01:07:59.776
It was large. it was huge.
It was still walking towards me.

1176
01:07:59.811 --> 01:08:04.583
I've discharged my weapon
in its direction two times.

1177
01:08:04.618 --> 01:08:06.288
You have to imagine

1178
01:08:06.323 --> 01:08:09.819
when you fire a gun
at nighttime.

1179
01:08:09.854 --> 01:08:12.921
that you have an effect

1180
01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:15.561
of almost like a camera
going off.

1181
01:08:15.596 --> 01:08:18.058
and that camera instills
something in your brain.

1182
01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:20.764
so. I have this image.

1183
01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:24.603
instilled in my head
of when the flash went out.

1184
01:08:26.277 --> 01:08:28.706
<i>And the animal...</i>

1185
01:08:30.644 --> 01:08:33.447
<i>It was like it responded</i>
<i>to the firearm.</i>

1186
01:08:33.482 --> 01:08:35.075
<i>It was intelligent.</i>

1187
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:37.286
<i>It knew that that...</i>

1188
01:08:37.321 --> 01:08:40.850
firearm was dangerous to it.
because it reacted.

1189
01:08:40.885 --> 01:08:44.260
it moved and it went
backwards before I fired.

1190
01:08:44.295 --> 01:08:47.725
<i>It is as if</i>
<i>it could jump and leap</i>

1191
01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.201
beyond any human understanding.

1192
01:08:51.236 --> 01:08:53.269
It jumped to the rock face

1193
01:08:53.304 --> 01:08:55.832
that was beside of it.

1194
01:08:55.867 --> 01:08:59.572
and in an instant was...
it was gone.

1195
01:08:59.607 --> 01:09:03.675
It disappeared and went
over the ridge above us.

1196
01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:06.480
When I fired my weapon.

1197
01:09:06.515 --> 01:09:10.385
my hunting partner behind me
discharged his firearm.

1198
01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:12.948
in the opposite direction of me.

1199
01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:14.554
I am screaming at this point.

1200
01:09:14.589 --> 01:09:16.985
I'm screaming. I don't even know
what I'm saying.

1201
01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:19.757
but it's time
to back up to the truck

1202
01:09:19.792 --> 01:09:23.992
where we were parked.
and I began to cover above me.

1203
01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:27.127
I covered to the left of me.
and he's walking.

1204
01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.667
<i>and we're walking behind us.</i>

1205
01:09:30.671 --> 01:09:32.275
<i>As we get to the truck.</i>

1206
01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:35.377
<i>I jump up into the back-end</i>
<i>of the pickup truck.</i>

1207
01:09:35.412 --> 01:09:39.139
<i>He gets in. cranks the vehicle.</i>
<i>I am standing in the back</i>

1208
01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:44.045
<i>of the pickup truck.</i>
<i>the lights.</i>
<i>flow towards a field</i>

1209
01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.179
<i>that was in front of us.</i>

1210
01:09:46.214 --> 01:09:47.752
<i>Directly in front of me...</i>

1211
01:09:48.986 --> 01:09:53.692
<i>were two huge figures.</i>
<i>creatures.</i>

1212
01:09:53.727 --> 01:09:57.564
<i>I believe that what</i>
<i>was stalking</i>
<i>me in the woods.</i>

1213
01:09:57.599 --> 01:10:03.196
<i>I believe that whatever I fired</i>
<i>at to the left of my camp.</i>

1214
01:10:03.231 --> 01:10:08.234
<i>was what people</i>
<i>refer to as a Dogman.</i>

1215
01:10:08.269 --> 01:10:11.138
<i>But I know what was</i>
<i>in the headlights</i>
<i>of that truck.</i>

1216
01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:13.173
<i>was not the same creature.</i>

1217
01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:17.320
because it towered at least
another two or three foot taller

1218
01:10:17.355 --> 01:10:20.422
than the animals
that I had seen in my camp.

1219
01:10:20.457 --> 01:10:23.722
These were two
very large creatures.

1220
01:10:23.757 --> 01:10:25.394
and I realized that one of them

1221
01:10:25.429 --> 01:10:28.925
was the exact thing
that I had seen in the distance.

1222
01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.433
that I believed to be a man
in a ghillie suit.

1223
01:10:31.468 --> 01:10:33.666
and it was not a man
in a ghillie suit.

1224
01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:35.899
It was not a bear.

1225
01:10:35.934 --> 01:10:40.134
It was on two legs. bipedal.

1226
01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:43.775
That's what I believe
was whistling the entire time

1227
01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:46.107
that I had heard in the woods.

1228
01:10:46.142 --> 01:10:48.879
That's what my partner
had heard whistling.

1229
01:10:48.914 --> 01:10:52.146
were the two figures
that I observed in the field

1230
01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:53.620
in front of me.

1231
01:10:53.655 --> 01:10:55.391
Were they working

1232
01:10:55.426 --> 01:10:57.250
with the other animals?

1233
01:10:57.285 --> 01:10:58.251
I just say the words.

1234
01:10:58.286 --> 01:11:00.891
Were they working
with the Dogman?

1235
01:11:00.926 --> 01:11:03.091
Were they guiding the Dogman.

1236
01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:08.734
or were there...
Were the two large creatures

1237
01:11:08.769 --> 01:11:10.670
there to protect me?

1238
01:11:10.705 --> 01:11:12.199
I do not know.

1239
01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:15.103
My partner
fires up the pickup truck.

1240
01:11:15.138 --> 01:11:18.304
and we speed out of the area.

1241
01:11:18.339 --> 01:11:23.243
As I turn around behind me.
something was tearing my...

1242
01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:26.114
our camp completely to pieces.

1243
01:11:30.494 --> 01:11:33.495
<i>There are Bigfoot</i>
<i>stories from the region.</i>

1244
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:35.464
<i>There's supposedly a large.</i>
<i>aggressive Bigfoot</i>

1245
01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:37.059
<i>in Land Between the Lakes.</i>

1246
01:11:37.094 --> 01:11:40.260
<i>It just goes wherever it wants.</i>
<i>They've nicknamed it Stonefoot.</i>

1247
01:11:40.295 --> 01:11:42.405
<i>And. we even have found</i>

1248
01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.539
<i>Bigfoot tracks</i>
<i>up towards the north.</i>

1249
01:11:44.574 --> 01:11:47.102
close to around the site
where the family was attacked.

1250
01:11:47.137 --> 01:11:49.038
So. they are in the park.

1251
01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:53.482
- <i> We stopped</i>
<i>and we attempted to report</i>

1252
01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:55.979
<i>what took place with us.</i>

1253
01:11:56.014 --> 01:12:00.852
<i>and we were told</i>
<i>that we had overreacted.</i>

1254
01:12:00.887 --> 01:12:04.724
that we had observed
what they said was a rogue bear.

1255
01:12:04.759 --> 01:12:07.188
There are things
that I will not say on camera.

1256
01:12:07.223 --> 01:12:10.158
People that I've spoken
with over the years.

1257
01:12:10.193 --> 01:12:11.533
You have to understand

1258
01:12:11.568 --> 01:12:14.899
that the law enforcement field
is a tight brethren.

1259
01:12:14.934 --> 01:12:17.968
There is a unwritten rule
that you will not talk

1260
01:12:18.003 --> 01:12:20.267
of anything
coming out of the park.

1261
01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:22.038
I mean. these guys
have pensions.

1262
01:12:22.073 --> 01:12:23.710
these guys have family.

1263
01:12:23.745 --> 01:12:27.340
Can you imagine working
for somewhere for 20 or 30 years

1264
01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:29.078
and you are called
into the office

1265
01:12:29.113 --> 01:12:31.344
and you are told
that. due to the fact

1266
01:12:31.379 --> 01:12:33.280
you spoke
in public about an incident

1267
01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:36.019
that took place.
that you're fired?

1268
01:12:36.054 --> 01:12:39.220
I believe it's entirely possible
that they cover stuff like that.

1269
01:12:39.255 --> 01:12:41.662
They'd lose a lot of money
if people learned

1270
01:12:41.697 --> 01:12:43.697
that there was something
that looked like a werewolf

1271
01:12:43.732 --> 01:12:46.392
wandering through the park.
or possibly even Bigfoot.

1272
01:12:46.427 --> 01:12:47.767
<i>They'd lose a lot of money.</i>

1273
01:12:47.802 --> 01:12:51.804
<i>So. if one person disappears.</i>
<i>or a few people.</i>

1274
01:12:51.839 --> 01:12:53.905
<i>wouldn't it be for them.</i>

1275
01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.401
<i>wouldn't it be</i>
<i>the most profitable decision</i>

1276
01:12:55.436 --> 01:12:56.677
<i>to just cover it up</i>
<i>and make it look</i>

1277
01:12:56.712 --> 01:12:58.481
<i>like something never happened?</i>

1278
01:12:58.516 --> 01:13:01.011
At this point.
there are many people

1279
01:13:01.046 --> 01:13:04.080
that have went missing.
or have come up.

1280
01:13:04.115 --> 01:13:07.413
they've been found dead
within the park.

1281
01:13:07.448 --> 01:13:10.350
<i>And this is a phenomenon</i>
<i>that it is not contained</i>

1282
01:13:10.385 --> 01:13:12.528
<i>to Land Between the Lakes.</i>

1283
01:13:12.563 --> 01:13:15.696
<i>This has taken place</i>
<i>in a lot of our national parks.</i>

1284
01:13:15.731 --> 01:13:18.391
<i>It is a very scary thought</i>
<i>that the general public</i>

1285
01:13:18.426 --> 01:13:20.602
<i>is tourism.</i>

1286
01:13:20.637 --> 01:13:23.737
<i>To a certain extent.</i>
<i>the general public is unarmed</i>

1287
01:13:23.772 --> 01:13:25.541
<i>when they enter these parks.</i>

1288
01:13:25.576 --> 01:13:29.941
<i>unable to defend themselves</i>
<i>against anything. man or beast.</i>

1289
01:13:32.616 --> 01:13:34.209
From all the encounters

1290
01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:35.782
that I have talked
to people with.

1291
01:13:35.817 --> 01:13:38.653
it's just not
simply encountering

1292
01:13:38.688 --> 01:13:40.556
an animal out there.

1293
01:13:40.591 --> 01:13:41.821
<i>There are earth lights</i>

1294
01:13:41.856 --> 01:13:43.383
<i>often attached</i>
<i>to these sightings.</i>

1295
01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:47.288
There are feelings of dread
associated with this.

1296
01:13:47.323 --> 01:13:50.698
In my opinion.
what we were dealing with here

1297
01:13:50.733 --> 01:13:54.801
is not a human simply
shape-shifting into an animal.

1298
01:13:54.836 --> 01:13:57.463
<i>or some sort</i>
<i>of uncatalogued creature</i>

1299
01:13:57.498 --> 01:13:59.707
<i>that is roaming</i>
<i>the wilds of America</i>

1300
01:13:59.742 --> 01:14:02.270
<i>that has yet</i>
<i>to be categorized by science.</i>

1301
01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:04.305
<i>I think there is something here</i>

1302
01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:07.913
<i>that is far beyond</i>
<i>our knowledge.</i>

1303
01:14:07.948 --> 01:14:12.478
<i>It appears as if</i>
<i>these creatures</i>
<i>are coming from another source.</i>

1304
01:14:12.513 --> 01:14:14.447
<i>and they bleed into our world.</i>

1305
01:14:14.482 --> 01:14:16.790
or we bleed into their world.
or what have you.

1306
01:14:16.825 --> 01:14:20.321
There almost has to be
an unspoken agreement

1307
01:14:20.356 --> 01:14:23.258
between the person that is
witnessing these creatures.

1308
01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:24.930
and the creatures themselves.

1309
01:14:24.965 --> 01:14:27.999
It seems there is some sort
of exchange of energy going on.

1310
01:14:28.034 --> 01:14:30.331
and for these things
to manifest themselves.

1311
01:14:30.366 --> 01:14:32.267
they would need your energy

1312
01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:35.270
to feed off.
to make almost a circuit

1313
01:14:35.305 --> 01:14:36.843
in which everything is fired up.

1314
01:14:36.878 --> 01:14:39.615
and then these things
can then appear

1315
01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:41.375
and manifest within our reality.

1316
01:14:48.021 --> 01:14:50.351
<i>It bothered me for years.</i>

1317
01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:53.090
<i>I'm not saying that I had</i>
<i>post-traumatic stress.</i>

1318
01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:54.630
<i>I'm not saying that.</i>

1319
01:14:54.665 --> 01:14:56.192
<i>but I know that every time</i>

1320
01:14:56.227 --> 01:14:59.162
<i>I walked out of my house</i>
<i>at night.</i>

1321
01:14:59.197 --> 01:15:02.462
I was always had this fear

1322
01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:04.299
of what's lurking
behind the house.

1323
01:15:04.334 --> 01:15:05.575
What could be under the car?

1324
01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:07.368
What could be behind that bush.

1325
01:15:07.403 --> 01:15:10.140
because in the back
of my mind. it's always there.

1326
01:15:10.175 --> 01:15:11.647
It could be there.

1327
01:15:11.682 --> 01:15:13.242
And the other thing that really
kind of stuck out to me.

1328
01:15:13.277 --> 01:15:15.376
was. as I sat back
and I reflected.

1329
01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:18.819
was. if that thing's real.
what the hell else is real?

1330
01:15:23.727 --> 01:15:25.353
- <i> I didn't let it</i>
<i>control my life.</i>

1331
01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:27.729
<i>and as a matter of fact.</i>

1332
01:15:27.764 --> 01:15:30.358
<i>I kind of swept it into the...</i>

1333
01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:33.163
<i>into the back recesses</i>
<i>of my mind.</i>

1334
01:15:33.198 --> 01:15:35.528
<i>and now and again</i>
<i>it would come up.</i>

1335
01:15:35.563 --> 01:15:37.739
<i>I get the pin pricks</i>
<i>in the back of my neck.</i>

1336
01:15:37.774 --> 01:15:39.532
<i>and I think I'm just...</i>

1337
01:15:39.567 --> 01:15:41.710
<i>Too much imagination.</i>

1338
01:15:41.745 --> 01:15:44.647
<i>I hid this from myself.</i>

1339
01:15:44.682 --> 01:15:46.682
<i>I would...</i>
<i>I rarely told anyone.</i>

1340
01:15:46.717 --> 01:15:50.543
because you tell someone.
and yeah.

1341
01:15:50.578 --> 01:15:52.985
they're condescending at best.

1342
01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:56.054
just laugh.
or think you're joking. and...

1343
01:15:56.089 --> 01:15:58.353
Now. at this age. I don't care

1344
01:15:58.388 --> 01:16:01.521
whether you believe me or not.
it doesn't matter.

1345
01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:02.962
It happened.

1346
01:16:05.626 --> 01:16:08.066
- <i> The only thing</i>
<i>I could literally tell people</i>

1347
01:16:08.101 --> 01:16:09.199
<i>I saw was a werewolf.</i>

1348
01:16:09.234 --> 01:16:10.497
<i>which probably didn't help</i>
<i>the fact</i>

1349
01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:12.598
<i>that people</i>
<i>thought I was crazy.</i>

1350
01:16:12.633 --> 01:16:13.841
<i>And like I've told her.</i>

1351
01:16:13.876 --> 01:16:15.744
<i>every time</i>
<i>I talk about it to anybody.</i>

1352
01:16:15.779 --> 01:16:17.372
<i>the nightmares come back.</i>

1353
01:16:19.046 --> 01:16:20.650
<i>I 've woke up</i>
<i>screaming in the night.</i>

1354
01:16:20.685 --> 01:16:23.411
<i>My wife shook me.</i>

1355
01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:25.754
<i>It scares me to my core</i>
<i>to know that these things</i>

1356
01:16:25.789 --> 01:16:27.888
<i>are still out there.</i>
<i>moving and walking around.</i>

1357
01:16:29.056 --> 01:16:31.485
<i>These things are built</i>
<i>to hurt something.</i>

1358
01:16:34.699 --> 01:16:36.798
<i>Trust me. you don't want</i>
<i>to see one.</i>

1359
01:16:42.168 --> 01:16:45.466
- <i> I have nightmares.</i>
<i>I'm plagued with dreams.</i>

1360
01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:47.534
<i>At one point.</i>
<i>I spoke with a professional</i>

1361
01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:50.603
<i>that said that I had...</i>
<i>I had seen something.</i>

1362
01:16:50.638 --> 01:16:53.309
<i>that had traumatized my memory.</i>

1363
01:16:53.344 --> 01:16:56.543
<i>I couldn't accept</i>
<i>what I had saw.</i>

1364
01:16:56.578 --> 01:17:00.756
<i>That trauma of whatever</i>
<i>that had occurred that night.</i>

1365
01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:03.286
<i>and the incident</i>
<i>that I had seen.</i>

1366
01:17:03.321 --> 01:17:05.552
<i>that... It will haunt me.</i>

1367
01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:07.895
<i>It will be in my dreams.</i>

1368
01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:12.031
<i>They told me</i>
<i>to attempt to work it out.</i>

1369
01:17:12.066 --> 01:17:13.934
<i>I will not hunt</i>

1370
01:17:13.969 --> 01:17:16.101
in the deep woods any longer.

1371
01:17:16.136 --> 01:17:17.839
I have been to different states.

1372
01:17:17.874 --> 01:17:22.206
I have hunted in Montana.
I have hunted in Wyoming.

1373
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:27.783
I have fished where
I've had grizzly bears

1374
01:17:27.818 --> 01:17:31.017
within 20 to 30 yards of me
when I'm fly fishing.

1375
01:17:31.712 --> 01:17:33.514
They don't scare me.

1376
01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:34.614
That scares me.

1377
01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:36.484
What I saw that night.

1378
01:17:36.519 --> 01:17:40.763
was such an intense feeling.
an evil...

1379
01:17:40.798 --> 01:17:41.764
A feeling of evil
that cannot be described.
