3
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.840
Hey. baby what happened?

4
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.800
Mommy is coming.

5
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.320
Jota. social services
will be here at 4 pm.

6
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.240
You know.
it’s British punctuality.

7
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.320
Please. you must
be home to greet them.

8
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.080
Stay here.
and do not move. okay?

9
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:24.080
Hey don't talk about this.
It's a secret.

10
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.240
What is it?

11
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.760
Diego is sick again...

12
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.800
Jota stayed home with him.

13
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.440
Jota isn´t getting paid.
they owe him money.

14
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.360
Social services are going
to our house again today at 4.30 pm.

15
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.560
let's see if it what they say is true...

16
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.120
The last visit
for Lu's final report.

17
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.440
Don´t even joke
about that. my dear.

18
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.680
Listen.
can you lend us some money?

19
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.520
You know we can’t...
What’s the matter?

20
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.680
Lu's hearing aid broke.

21
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.160
That stuff is really expensive.

22
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.040
What about the social services?
Can´t they help you with that?

23
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.320
No. It's not the right time
to ask for their help.

24
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.360
I'd only prove them right.

25
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.000
But if we can´t help.
shouldn´t they?

26
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.520
I know. but that’s
not going to work.

27
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.360
You can´t imagine what we've
been through with them.

28
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.200
How is Lu doing without it?

29
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.200
She can´t hear a thing...
We need to solve that...

30
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.840
It can´t be.

31
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.320
Is baby Jessy there with you?

32
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.800
Yes!
I have to breastfeed her in a while.

33
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.560
Do you still have milk?

34
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.280
I have.

35
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.040
Feeling better. kid?

36
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.600
The same.

37
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.920
When Mom arrives.
we’ll have lunch.

38
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.480
We can only go shopping
the day after tomorrow.

39
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.800
You have to get up.
I need your help.

40
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.640
Please.
speak in Portuguese with me.

41
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.160
Today we will receive a visit.

42
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.040
See? Looks like new.

43
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.800
But mom will like it.

44
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.240
Let's take a bath!

45
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.440
Move on...

46
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.440
Don't be so boring.

47
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.440
Where is it...

48
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.280
With what?

49
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.440
Fuck. kid.
you're burning up!

50
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.280
I told you I have a temperature.

51
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.640
You gotta lie down.
come on.

52
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.120
I'm sorry mom.

53
00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.160
I'm sorry.

54
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.960
They asked about the
marks on my backs.

55
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.440
I don´t know.

56
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.240
Sometimes my head shakes...

57
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.440
I don´t remember.

58
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.280
When I fell.

59
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.520
They asked if you hit me.
If dad hits me.

60
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.040
If my brother hits me.

61
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.040
I told the truth.

62
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.440
I hurt myself.
I fell.

63
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.720
I said the hearing aid
doesn´t "listen".

64
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.280
Yes. but it's a secret.

65
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.440
It's a secret isn´t it?

66
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.000
Yes.
but I didn´t tell them anything.

67
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.040
Jota?

68
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.600
Jota!

69
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.760
We have to leave now. Jota.
There’s no time.

70
00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.840
We don´t have time for this.

71
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.280
We can´t risk
the social services’ visit.

72
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.160
Lu has her back
in an abnormal state.

73
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.400
Turn around.

74
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.720
What are you doing?

75
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.840
I'm taking care of our boy's lunch.
What do you think I'm doing?

76
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.080
- You don´t get it. do you?
- You're the one "not getting it".

77
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.000
If you'd run away now.
they would catch you easily.

78
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.480
Do you want to get arrested?
Are you crazy?

79
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.360
- No. I'm not crazy.
- We're not going anywhere!

80
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.360
In a while.
they'll be knocking at our door

81
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.080
and life will return to normal.

82
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.480
We didn´t do anything wrong.

83
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.520
And that's it!

84
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.080
You're going crazy.
Stop all this drama!

85
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.840
You're making the kids panic!

86
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.520
Please get up and eat.

87
00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.640
Let's do everything
we need to do.

88
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.520
I've made you some coffee.

89
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.680
Drink it...

90
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.040
Please. drink.

91
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.960
You broke her hearing aid.

92
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.200
What’ve you done to her?
You hit her?

93
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.840
Bela. I never hurt her.
Never.

94
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.160
I never hit her in my life.

95
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.480
You screamed!

96
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.240
You've been punching the walls!

97
00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.200
- Bela!
- I don´t want anything.

98
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.600
If you'd heard me…

99
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.120
They want to give me
to another family.

100
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.960
I don´t want to go.

101
00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.000
I miss you so much.

102
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.520
I think in you everyday.

103
00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.040
No one here talks to me.
Only Diego.

104
00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.520
I want to talk with you...

105
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.480
Jota. seriously?

106
00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.920
I can't have a decent conversation
with my daughter.

107
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.160
Did you really have
to pull that crap?

108
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.480
- Jota. so now it’s my fault!?
- Is it mine?

109
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.240
I need to speak with my children!

110
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.480
Why won´t they let me? Why?

111
00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.000
Lu said no one talks to her.
No one!

112
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.320
And you consider that to be normal?

113
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.160
I don´t think any of this is normal.

114
00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.080
I just wanted to be with them
the full hour I was entitled to.

115
00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.280
Even if I had to stay in silence.

116
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.440
Fuck!

117
00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.520
Bela?

118
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.520
Look...

119
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.080
I've found someone
who can really help us.

120
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.360
Really? Who?

121
00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:48.440
She used to work for the social services.
her name is Anne Payne.

122
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.560
Are you crazy?

123
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.480
A social services drop out?
From here?

124
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.800
- You're crazy.
- Yes.

125
00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.440
I've a meeting tomorrow.

126
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.520
Look at me...
I'm going.

127
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.520
- You're insane!
- Don´t you trust me?

128
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.960
I don´t care.
I'm going!

129
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.920
Say that again?
You're telling me that?

130
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.320
You must be kidding.
You're really doing this?

131
00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.080
They're my kids.

132
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.040
Like that woman
would ever help us.

133
00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.320
Please. do something.

134
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.040
Don´t you ask yourself
what they're doing?

135
00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.120
I ask myself when we'll
have them back.

136
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.520
It will happen.
What's your doubt?

137
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.880
You will see.
it will happen.

138
00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:11.120
- And Jessy if she goes?
- You can´t know that!

139
00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.280
Stop thinking shit!

140
00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.800
Fuck!

141
00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.960
I'm sorry.

142
00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.920
Are you okay?

143
00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.320
We should had run away.

144
00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.040
Wake up...

145
00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.600
Come to our bed.

146
00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.040
Don´t stay here again.

147
00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.360
- I'm tired.
- All the more reason.

148
00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.360
Come to bed.

149
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.000
You can´t stay here forever.

150
00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.240
Come on.

151
00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:20.680
I'm at a restaurant. Mum.
I don´t know where.

152
00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:23.000
The address.
Ask him the address.

153
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.560
Son. delete all the records.

154
00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:30.840
Anne will take care of everything.
Someone will pick us up.

155
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.880
Look...
He's coming!

156
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.320
Don´t forget the number.

157
00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:22.800
Bela. don´t exagerate!
Bela. control yourself!

158
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.520
- I can´t believe their nerve...
- Ok. but just don´t overdo it.

159
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.560
They're new.

160
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:18.360
Hey. look at me.

161
00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:35.800
Look at me...

162
01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.720
I never knew you
could speak like that.

163
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.000
I don´t know...

164
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.800
Don´t know if it was worth it...

165
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.640
or even if that was enough.

166
01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.240
We've lost.

167
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.720
Better late than never.
