I mean. everything happened
kind of incrementally for us.

170
00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:45.946
But there was
never a point where I thought.

171
00:11:46.084 --> 00:11:48.880
"My God. I'm more famous than
I expected to be."

172
00:11:49.018 --> 00:11:52.332
because I was so busy
thinking about trying
to get to the next level.

173
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:56.888
But. I always believed.
deep down.

174
00:11:57.026 --> 00:12:00.098

It was like a dream. really.

180
00:12:14.112 --> 00:12:18.047
I know that there was this
overwhelming feeling
of pride.

181
00:12:18.185 --> 00:12:24.674
and also a horrible awareness
that meant
a kind of end for Andrew and I.

182
00:12:24.813 --> 00:12:27.436
But on that final day.
I remember us
hugging each other

183
00:12:27.574 --> 00:12:30.750

was something incredibly sad
going on

184

become an international

And as though there's always
been this red line.

188

at the final concert.

00:21:31.704 --> 00:21:34.672
to kind of define what
my solo image
was going to be.

333
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.365
But I really had no idea
how effective
it was going to be.

334
00:21:37.503 --> 00:21:38.849
especially in America.

335
00:21:40.437 --> 00:21:46.235
And I had no idea what
it was like to be that big
in America.

336
00:21:46.374 --> 00:21:48.721
WOMAN: George is really.
really private

337
00:21:48.859 --> 00:21:51.275
and I think. when he was young.
with all that fame.

338
00:21:51.413 --> 00:21:56.176
I just think it came too fast.
and it wasn't actually
what he was expecting.

339
00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:59.145
I was probably
most out of control.

340
00:21:59.283 --> 00:22:02.735
in any kind of sense of that.
during the whole "Faith" thing.

341
00:22:05.565 --> 00:22:10.190
Being caught in the eye
of this storm
is catastrophic.

342
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:15.782
It's just 24/7 full time
in your face.

343
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.165
I mean. the wind burn
is terrible.

344
00:22:19.303 --> 00:22:24.273
MICHAEL: I can't really explain
how overwhelming

345
00:22:24.412 --> 00:22:29.175
that kind of hysteria can be
if there's only one person
to absorb it.

346
00:22:29.313 --> 00:22:33.731
When I was with Andrew.
it was so easy to keep
one foot in my old life.

347
00:22:33.869 --> 00:22:37.597
the life that I had known
with him before
we'd been famous.

348
00:22:37.735 --> 00:22:39.668
It was so easy
to keep each other grounded.

349
00:22:39.806 --> 00:22:41.360
to take the piss out
of each other.

350
00:22:41.498 --> 00:22:42.982
and be able to look
at each other

351
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.779
and talk about the madness
that was going on around us.

352
00:22:46.917 --> 00:22:49.713
But when you can't do that.
suddenly. it is scary.

353
00:22:51.956 --> 00:22:58.998
I don't know many 24-year-olds
who would not have.
at least subconsciously.

354
00:22:59.136 --> 00:23:02.035
found that frightening enough
to self-destruct.

355
00:23:04.452 --> 00:23:06.039
PAUL RUSSELL:
Now the problem is.
the record came out

356
00:23:06.177 --> 00:23:08.697
everywhere in the world.
pretty much at the same time.

357
00:23:08.835 --> 00:23:14.393
So. everybody wanted
a piece of George
to help promote the album.

358
00:23:16.222 --> 00:23:17.568
Enormous pressure.

359
00:23:17.706 --> 00:23:19.225
Huge. huge pressure.

360
00:23:20.882 --> 00:23:24.748
MICHAEL:
Ten months of that was enough
to really push me to the edge.

361
00:23:26.059 --> 00:23:29.408
And I was terribly lonely.
you know?

362
00:23:29.546 --> 00:23:33.308
Me and my red line
were very lonely.

363
00:23:33.446 --> 00:23:38.486
And the only good part
of my day was playing live.

364
00:23:38.624 --> 00:23:41.350
When I sang
"Careless Whisper"...

365
00:23:41.489 --> 00:23:44.699
I can't remember which
was the last gig
on the American tour.

366
00:23:44.837 --> 00:23:46.390
which would have been
the end of the whole tour.

367
00:23:46.528 --> 00:23:48.668
I think it was Pensacola.

368
00:23:48.806 --> 00:23:51.533
But when I sang
"Careless Whisper" that night.

369
00:23:51.671 --> 00:23:55.295
I remember standing there.
with a tear
in my eye. thinking.

370
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:58.022
"I really don't know
if I'll ever do this again."

371
00:23:59.127 --> 00:24:02.613
♪ Time can never mend

372
00:24:11.208 --> 00:24:15.108
♪ The careless whispers

373
00:24:16.247 --> 00:24:20.424
♪ Of a good friend

374
00:24:23.254 --> 00:24:25.602
♪ To the heart and mind

375
00:24:27.983 --> 00:24:31.193
♪ Ignorance is kind

♪ Pain is all♪

378
00:25:15.134 --> 00:25:21.485
I was intelligent enough
to know I should not be trying
to catch up with

379
00:25:21.623 --> 00:25:24.108
Michael Jackson or Madonna
or whatever.

380
00:25:24.246 --> 00:25:27.353
which was absolutely what
I was intent on doing.

381
00:25:27.491 --> 00:25:34.705
I felt that tired and exhausted
at being the center
of that much attention.

382
00:25:34.843 --> 00:25:38.260
I suppose the way my lack
of mental balance showed itself

383
00:25:38.398 --> 00:25:42.713
was that I actually
really began
to hide away when I got home.

384
00:25:44.025 --> 00:25:46.545
And I did almost nothing
for a year.

385
00:25:46.683 --> 00:25:51.342
but try and reestablish
some idea of the real life.

386
00:25:53.413 --> 00:25:57.763
Music was
my very controlling lover.

387
00:25:59.074 --> 00:26:02.388
I had millions of lovers
that I never saw

388
00:26:02.526 --> 00:26:06.219
other than
in the sense of live work.

389
00:26:06.944 --> 00:26:08.567
But I still deserved one.

390
00:26:08.705 --> 00:26:10.292
Just one of them for me.

391
00:26:12.053 --> 00:26:16.644
And I knew that
the only way I was gonna find
that one person.

392
00:26:16.782 --> 00:26:21.441
that lover.
was to jump off
of the merry-go-round

393
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.135
just for long enough
to catch my breath.

394
00:26:25.273 --> 00:26:30.278
and letting my heart rule
my head. rather than.
you know. the red line.

395
00:26:31.624 --> 00:26:34.834
The red line that goes
up. up. up. up. up. up.

396
00:26:36.422 --> 00:26:39.080
Sometimes you feel like he's...

397
00:26:39.218 --> 00:26:42.670
He's got. like. a layer or two
of skin missing.

398
00:26:45.017 --> 00:26:49.538
Like he just.
like he bruises easier.

399
00:26:49.677 --> 00:26:52.541
and because of that.
he can write
these amazing songs.

400
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.234
I never wanted
to be someone else.

401
00:26:55.372 --> 00:27:00.135
I wanted to be a star.
and I wanted people to love me
and recognize me in the street.

402
00:27:00.273 --> 00:27:01.654
As a child.
that's what I wanted.

403
00:27:01.792 --> 00:27:04.105
but I never really wanted
to be someone else.

404
00:27:06.003 --> 00:27:08.488
I believe I am a writer
much more than I am
anything else.

405
00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:10.698
And I want to leave songs.

406
00:27:10.836 --> 00:27:14.322
I believe I can leave songs
that will be. will mean
something to other generations.

407
00:27:18.844 --> 00:27:21.743
This award is for
favorite soul and R&B album.

408
00:27:21.881 --> 00:27:27.507
And the winner is.
George Michael.

409
00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.406
George Michael.

410
00:27:40.003 --> 00:27:42.868
I've been a lover of soul music
since I was a kid.

411
00:27:45.525 --> 00:27:49.357
And I'd just like to thank
everybody who has helped me
this year.

412
00:27:49.495 --> 00:27:53.361
I'd like to thank Black Radio.
I'd like to thank everyone
at CBS Records.

413
00:27:54.086 --> 00:27:55.397
in the R&B department.

414
00:27:55.535 --> 00:27:58.055
And I'd like to thank everyone
who voted for me.

415
00:27:58.193 --> 00:27:59.816
I can't believe it.
Thank you very much.

416
00:28:02.888 --> 00:28:07.444
I won these two awards
that were traditionally
received by black artists.

417
00:28:09.964 --> 00:28:13.174
And I think there
was a perception
that it had gone too far.

418
00:28:13.312 --> 00:28:17.592
The black male artist
works very hard to get his due.

419
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.802
and Bobby Brown
had across the board play.

420
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:25.773
And he could compete
in the same category
as George Michael competes in.

421
00:28:25.911 --> 00:28:27.429
That would be
a whole another thing.

422
00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:29.535
I didn't ask to be given
those awards.

423
00:28:29.673 --> 00:28:32.987
I'm not going to pretend
I wasn't happy to get them.

424
00:28:33.125 --> 00:28:36.784
But I do understand
what the argument that says.

425
00:28:36.922 --> 00:28:41.685
"This guy is just
an acceptable version
of black music

426
00:28:41.823 --> 00:28:44.239
for White America."

427
00:28:44.377 --> 00:28:47.415
Suddenly. crossover
was not hip.

428
00:28:47.553 --> 00:28:51.005
And I see that point.
I totally saw the point
at the time.

429
00:28:51.143 --> 00:28:52.834
I just felt it was sad.
you know.

430
00:28:52.972 --> 00:28:55.388
that white and black people
recording together.

431
00:28:55.526 --> 00:28:58.115
suddenly was. kind of.
dancing with the enemy.

432
00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.841
You mean George is white?

433
00:29:01.532 --> 00:29:02.533
Are you serious?

434
00:29:03.017 --> 00:29:04.018
Oh. my God!

435
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.330
And he is blind. right?

436
00:29:06.468 --> 00:29:08.401
I think it had
a huge effect on George.

437
00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:11.991
because he'd won
in this category.

438
00:29:12.129 --> 00:29:16.927
he'd achieved something
that was beyond
his wildest dreams.

439
00:29:17.065 --> 00:29:20.759
only to have the carpet pulled
from under his feet.

440
00:29:20.897 --> 00:29:26.488
I don't think there's
any attempt to. kind of.
steal black heritage

441
00:29:26.626 --> 00:29:28.007
in what I'm doing.

442
00:29:28.145 --> 00:29:30.803
All I think that's happening is
I'm trying to make good music.

443
00:29:30.941 --> 00:29:34.531
Music is not based on
the color of one's skin.

444
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:38.259
or. you know. this is soul music
or this is pop.

445
00:29:38.397 --> 00:29:40.502
To me. those things are like.
it's kind of old.

446
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.710
You know what I mean?

447
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:54.723
MICHAEL: I suddenly couldn't
get anywhere near radio.
Black Radio.

448
00:29:54.862 --> 00:29:56.415
And that
was the reason. really.

449
00:29:56.553 --> 00:29:59.245
Listen Without Prejudice
was called
Listen Without Prejudice.

450
00:29:59.383 --> 00:30:04.043
It was me saying.
"Here's an album that has bits
of gospel. you know.

451
00:30:04.181 --> 00:30:07.909
bits of R&B.
some very white stuff."

452
00:30:08.047 --> 00:30:11.499
and it was just trying to say.
"Let me be
both of these things

453
00:30:11.637 --> 00:30:14.088
"without having to be
one or the other."

454
00:30:14.226 --> 00:30:16.331
LIAM GALLAGHER:
I don't know if I
bought it. stole it.

455
00:30:16.469 --> 00:30:19.438
or it just. sort of like.
just got delivered.

456
00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:23.442
You know. I mean. sometimes you
get albums like that. don't you?

457
00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.170
You know what I mean?
They're that great.
they just end up in your house.

458
00:30:27.308 --> 00:30:28.585
ELTON JOHN:
What can I say about
the sound of it?

459
00:30:28.723 --> 00:30:30.242
It's very ethereal.

460
00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.761
It has a mystery about it.

461
00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.249
George. on this album.
got everything that he had
inside his gut.

462
00:30:37.387 --> 00:30:41.529
onto vinyl or CD or cassette.

463
00:30:41.667 --> 00:30:42.841
And thank God he did.

464
00:30:44.152 --> 00:30:46.016
Well. let's have
a party pop song.

such a big opening.
a message. actually. I think.

468
00:31:02.377 --> 00:31:05.311

it reminds me of John Lennon.

475
00:31:25.918 --> 00:31:29.404
I think. not only he's tapped
into his dark side

476
00:31:29.542 --> 00:31:31.544
of whatever's going on
in his life.

477
00:31:31.682 --> 00:31:37.309
but he's tapped into the truth
about who he is and what he is.
and what life is.

478
00:31:37.447 --> 00:31:39.794

is "The rich declare

I mean. that's the way
I take it anyway.

00:32:11.067 --> 00:32:12.965

The Beatles that has done

00:53:35.177 --> 00:53:40.389
Anselmo was the first time
I think I really loved
someone selflessly.

825
00:53:41.563 --> 00:53:42.874
It was. kind of. immediate.

826
00:53:43.012 --> 00:53:45.187
Everybody. with the exception
of my family.

827
00:53:45.325 --> 00:53:48.086
was introduced to him
very. very quickly

828
00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:51.124
because I felt immediately
that everything had changed.

829
00:53:54.886 --> 00:53:56.888
DAVID AUSTIN:
All our friends knew.
of course.

830
00:53:57.026 --> 00:54:00.167
I remember seeing him
and just thinking

831
00:54:00.306 --> 00:54:03.032
how I just was feeling
so happy for him.

832
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:06.829
The two of them met
and changed George's life.

833
00:54:55.878 --> 00:55:00.020
It's very hard to be proud
of your own sexuality

834
00:55:00.158 --> 00:55:01.574
when it hasn't brought you
any joy.

835
00:55:02.678 --> 00:55:07.545
Once it is associated
with joy and love.

836
00:55:07.683 --> 00:55:09.478
it's easy to be proud
of who you are.

837
00:55:13.724 --> 00:55:16.313
The first time you
actually believe somebody
loves you.

838
00:55:18.487 --> 00:55:20.040
that's a wonderful moment
in your life.

839
00:55:20.178 --> 00:55:22.422
and it was a wonderful
six months.

840
00:55:23.078 --> 00:55:24.631
What a poser.

841
00:55:24.769 --> 00:55:28.325
He was just
very full of energy.
very loving.

842
00:55:30.119 --> 00:55:33.468
I was happier
than I'd ever been
in my entire life.

843
00:55:34.986 --> 00:55:38.473
AUSTIN:
He didn't care who saw him
with Anselmo.

844
00:55:38.611 --> 00:55:39.957
He'd found something.

845
00:55:40.095 --> 00:55:41.855
He'd found what he was looking
for. you know?

846
00:55:43.063 --> 00:55:45.272
MICHAEL:
By the time I met Anselmo.

847
00:55:45.411 --> 00:55:49.069
I had made the decision
to jump
off the merry-go-round.

848
00:55:49.207 --> 00:55:54.937
and I was already
in the early stages of my
confrontation with Sony.

849
00:55:56.456 --> 00:56:00.978
Recording an album.
and then saying.

850
00:56:01.116 --> 00:56:05.120
"I'm not going to promote it
or I'm not going to market it.

851
00:56:05.258 --> 00:56:07.294
I'm not going to participate."

852
00:56:08.813 --> 00:56:11.575
that's a serious detriment
to an album.

853
00:56:12.783 --> 00:56:15.613
I think we had
some personality issues

854
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:20.756
between people in the UK and
people in the American company.

855
00:56:20.894 --> 00:56:22.896
Why wasn't this
"Faith Part Two"?

856
00:56:24.001 --> 00:56:26.383
We wanted
all those nice pop songs.

857
00:56:26.521 --> 00:56:28.143
What do you mean he's not
going to promote?

858
00:56:28.281 --> 00:56:30.387
We're not going to have
his image on it?

859
00:56:30.525 --> 00:56:33.424
It's like saying.
"I'll do a movie but I...

860
00:56:33.562 --> 00:56:35.357
I won't do one premiere.

861
00:56:35.495 --> 00:56:37.911
I won't do any interviews
for the movie."

862
00:56:38.049 --> 00:56:39.844
You know. you say. "Oh. my God."

863
00:56:41.639 --> 00:56:44.159
TRACEY EMIN:
The moment someone says
to a musician or to an artist.

864
00:56:44.297 --> 00:56:47.231
make more of them
or do more of that.
it kills you.

865
00:56:47.369 --> 00:56:51.131
And I think probably for someone
like George. especially.

866
00:56:51.269 --> 00:56:54.687
at certain times in his career.
he must've felt quite trapped.

867
00:56:54.825 --> 00:57:00.451
In England. they made an effort.
and Listen Without Prejudice
outsold Faith.

868
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:02.315
And lots of places
it outsold Faith.

869
00:57:02.453 --> 00:57:04.490
because I think it
was actually a better album.

870
00:57:04.628 --> 00:57:05.905
But it wasn't about that.

871
00:57:06.043 --> 00:57:10.185
It was about the total and utter
lack of respect

872
00:57:10.323 --> 00:57:13.775
that the minute somebody doesn't
see themselves as a commodity.

873
00:57:13.913 --> 00:57:16.398
that they have the audacity
to think.

874
00:57:16.536 --> 00:57:19.677
"My God. I am actually
creating something

875
00:57:19.815 --> 00:57:23.440
and I must keep myself sane
in order to do that."

876
00:57:23.578 --> 00:57:26.788
The minute somebody does that.
they're over.

877
00:57:26.926 --> 00:57:30.136
We tried very. very hard

878
00:57:30.274 --> 00:57:34.485
to get the American executives
to come over

879
00:57:34.623 --> 00:57:38.765
and listen to why George felt
the way that he did

880
00:57:38.903 --> 00:57:41.665
from George. 'cause there
was no-one better
to put that forward

881
00:57:41.803 --> 00:57:45.462
than George Michael
telling them.
as he had told us.

882
00:57:47.049 --> 00:57:50.397
The reasons how he really
felt deep down.

883
00:57:51.606 --> 00:57:53.021
But they wouldn't come.

884
00:57:53.159 --> 00:57:57.888
MICHAEL:
There were executives that came
to London in 1989

885
00:57:58.026 --> 00:58:00.166
and we played them the record.

886
00:58:00.304 --> 00:58:05.620
I explained to them that
Faith had taken me
to the edge of madness.

887
00:58:05.758 --> 00:58:10.176
that I wanted to be
a long-term player
in this business.

888
00:58:10.314 --> 00:58:13.973
Now. any logical CEO. I think.
would have thought.

889
00:58:14.111 --> 00:58:16.078
"Okay. he's gonna do this.

890
00:58:16.216 --> 00:58:20.497
He'll get it out of his system
and he'll get back on board."

891
00:58:21.187 --> 00:58:22.740
George is very stubborn.

892
00:58:22.878 --> 00:58:26.054
He's incredibly one of the most
stubborn people I've ever met.

893
00:58:26.192 --> 00:58:28.228
But he was right to be stubborn
on this occasion.

894
00:58:28.366 --> 00:58:30.714
and I'm sure the record company
recoiled in horror.

895
00:58:30.852 --> 00:58:33.855
MICHAEL:
It was very much a clash
of cultures. really.

896
00:58:33.993 --> 00:58:36.858
In America.

a door that shut.

was not going to reinstate
any kind of
relationship with Sony.

918

then nothing was.

919
00:59:54.176 --> 00:59:55.868
I don't want to pick a fight.

920
00:59:56.006 --> 00:59:59.078
I just wanted to work
with people who wanted
to work with me

921
00:59:59.216 --> 01:00:04.911
and who would have
some respect for the fact
that I was growing up.

922
01:00:05.049 --> 01:00:09.088
It was deeply.
deeply troubling times.

923
01:00:09.226 --> 01:00:13.851
because you could see this.
it's like trying to watch
a train wreck in slow motion.

924
01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:15.957
There is nothing you could
do to stop it.

925
01:00:24.828 --> 01:00:28.107
MICHAEL:
Anselmo and I were in LA when

926
01:00:29.522 --> 01:00:31.420
he was advised
to go for his test.

927
01:00:34.838 --> 01:00:36.667
He hadn't been tested
for a while

928
01:00:36.805 --> 01:00:38.945
and he was absolutely
healthy looking.

929
01:00:39.083 --> 01:00:41.603
more than healthy looking.
when I first met him.

930
01:00:41.741 --> 01:00:44.882
Within a month or two
of meeting him.

931
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:48.714
he had a flu
that he couldn't get rid of.

932
01:00:48.852 --> 01:00:53.580
and some red marks
that came up on his chest.

933
01:00:53.719 --> 01:00:56.825
And I remember the kind
of terror of...

934
01:00:58.413 --> 01:01:00.864
me understanding
that this was possibly

935
01:01:02.175 --> 01:01:05.178
the beginning of. you know.
an illness.

936
01:01:05.316 --> 01:01:08.354
I remember him
leaving the house and...

937
01:01:11.012 --> 01:01:16.431
To this day. I remember
looking at the sky and saying.

938
01:01:16.569 --> 01:01:20.297
"Don't you dare do this to me."

939
01:01:20.435 --> 01:01:24.922
I mean. I was 20...
27 going on 28.

940
01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.752
But at that point in time.
you think.

941
01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:29.409
like. that's a lifetime
to have waited to be loved.

942
01:01:32.378 --> 01:01:34.104
Anselmo had the test

943
01:01:35.864 --> 01:01:36.969
in Brazil.

944
01:01:38.556 --> 01:01:45.702
I went home
to my family for Christmas
and sat at the Christmas table

945
01:01:47.807 --> 01:01:51.155
not knowing whether my partner.
whom the people

946
01:01:51.293 --> 01:01:53.364
sitting around the table
did not know about.

947
01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:58.024
not knowing whether
this man I was in love with
was terminally ill.

948
01:01:58.162 --> 01:02:02.719
And. therefore. not knowing
whether I potentially
was terminally ill.

949
01:02:02.857 --> 01:02:05.618
That Christmas was probably
the darkest.

950
01:02:06.895 --> 01:02:11.106
darkest. most frightening
time in my life.

951
01:02:14.903 --> 01:02:19.666
I remember my publicist
calling me to tell me
that Freddie Mercury had died.

952
01:02:21.668 --> 01:02:23.532
And he died of HIV obviously.

953
01:02:25.155 --> 01:02:30.022
And I remember I was...
I was crying and

954
01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.267
I actually just thought...
I mean. bless him.
I was really sad

955
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.063
that Freddie had passed away.

956
01:02:37.201 --> 01:02:41.447
But. of course. I was crying
about something else entirely.

957
01:02:41.585 --> 01:02:46.728
which was the fact that both
my partner and possibly myself
were HIV.

958
01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:54.253
GERVAIS:
It was an incredibly difficult
period for George.

959
01:02:54.391 --> 01:02:58.913
because it was something that
he had to hold close
to his chest.

960
01:03:00.017 --> 01:03:01.916
MICHAEL: I was just
absolutely devastated

961
01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.782
to find out that he had
a terminal illness.

962
01:03:06.644 --> 01:03:08.129
I was just devastated.

963
01:03:12.098 --> 01:03:15.584
Even by the time
Freddie's tribute
had been put together.

964
01:03:15.722 --> 01:03:18.001
I was still sworn to secrecy.

965
01:03:20.866 --> 01:03:22.695
I just wanted perfection.

966
01:03:24.662 --> 01:03:26.457
Which is what I always wanted.

967
01:03:29.564 --> 01:03:33.948
So. I went for five days
to rehearse.

968
01:03:34.086 --> 01:03:36.502
Everyone else went
for an afternoon.

969
01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.954
I went for five days.

970
01:03:40.092 --> 01:03:42.611
Because it had to be perfect.

971
01:03:42.749 --> 01:03:43.785
[SINGING]

972
01:03:53.795 --> 01:04:00.457
Because I had to take
all those years
of standing in a bedroom.

973
01:04:00.595 --> 01:04:02.390
with I don't think
I had a hairbrush.

974
01:04:02.528 --> 01:04:05.462
but I would stand
and sing to the mirror.

975
01:04:06.946 --> 01:04:10.812
And that child
was going to take
all that knowledge

976
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:16.645
all that subconscious
easing in
of music from that group

977
01:04:16.783 --> 01:04:20.477
and sing one
of Freddie Mercury's songs
to the world

978
01:04:20.615 --> 01:04:24.481
after his passing
in front of my lover.

979
01:04:31.729 --> 01:04:36.010
In my subconscious view.
this was. very probably

980
01:04:36.148 --> 01:04:39.185

where I handed over the mike
to the audience. and they.

01:07:13.546 --> 01:07:17.688

It's not an accident
that the performance

1042
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:51.471
probably most well-known
in my career was sung

1043
01:08:53.783 --> 01:08:57.236
to my lover who was dying.

1044
01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:05.657

the strength to go
to battle with Sony.

nothing but love this man

and care for this man.
if I could do nothing
beneficial as a musician

1047
01:09:20.225 --> 01:09:23.399
because I cannot even think
of a note.

1048
01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:27.473
maybe I have a chance to do
something truly special

1049
01:09:27.611 --> 01:09:31.995
and change the standard
record contract forever.

1050
01:09:32.133 --> 01:09:39.002
I didn't think that it would end
up in court. at the time

1051
01:09:39.139 --> 01:09:42.419
because I really thought
that sanity will prevail.

1052
01:09:42.557 --> 01:09:43.800
Well. I was wrong.

1053
01:09:44.249 --> 01:09:45.491
It didn't.

1054
01:09:45.629 --> 01:09:48.631
Our relationship broke down
because they said.

1055
01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:51.877
"No. you are this kind
of artist.

1056
01:09:52.014 --> 01:09:55.087
This is the kind of artist
that we sell.

1057
01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:57.469
This is the kind of artist
we know how to sell.

1058
01:09:57.607 --> 01:10:00.057
And if you don't want to sell
yourself that way.

1059
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:01.852
and you want to go off
on this journey

1060
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:05.925
and find this other audience.
we're not gonna support you."

1061
01:10:06.063 --> 01:10:09.722
The relationship
had completely disintegrated.

1062
01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:12.656
George flew out to New York
with his publisher

1063
01:10:12.794 --> 01:10:15.245
and basically.
it was at that meeting

1064
01:10:15.383 --> 01:10:17.764
that George told
the head people at Sony

1065
01:10:17.903 --> 01:10:21.527
that he'd wanted out
of the deal.
wanted a divorce.

1066
01:10:21.665 --> 01:10:26.601
What he was basically saying is.
"How can I stay
with a company...

1067
01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:32.952
who won't support me in any
way when I feel so strongly?"

1068
01:10:37.405 --> 01:10:39.442
We issued a writ
three days later.

1069
01:10:43.618 --> 01:10:49.866
MICHAEL: I will never know
if Sony and I
would have ended up in court

1070
01:10:50.004 --> 01:10:52.903
had Anselmo not become ill.

1071
01:10:55.803 --> 01:10:58.702
I was absolutely terrified
of losing him

1072
01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.947
and the prospect of watching
him die of AIDS.

1073
01:11:07.642 --> 01:11:10.058
I was in LA
and the phone rang.

1074
01:11:10.196 --> 01:11:14.407
and I was told that Anselmo's
best friend in Brazil
was on the phone.

1075
01:11:15.166 --> 01:11:16.202
And...

1076
01:11:18.032 --> 01:11:20.344
...then it all goes blurry
for a long time.

1077
01:11:51.168 --> 01:11:54.482
He still. 23 years later.
brings a tear to my eye.

1078
01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:57.243
He was... He was my savior.

1079
01:11:57.382 --> 01:12:03.457
It's still very hard
for me to explain how
finding a companion

1080
01:12:03.594 --> 01:12:07.978
at that stage in my life
changed me.

1081
01:12:08.116 --> 01:12:13.570
And such
a beautiful companion.
such an amazing person.

1082
01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.644
I think. to some degree.
the Sony court case

1083
01:12:18.782 --> 01:12:21.094
was a perfectly good place
to put my anger.

1084
01:12:21.233 --> 01:12:25.513
I used to go and run
on the treadmill everyday
and play squash

1085
01:12:25.651 --> 01:12:28.550
and do everything I could
to get rid of all of this
anger and fear.

1086
01:12:28.689 --> 01:12:32.106
But the best place for it
was court number one. really.

1087
01:12:33.969 --> 01:12:35.316
PRESSPERSON:
George. come on. George.

1088
01:12:37.594 --> 01:12:40.839
MICHAEL: There was the part
of my personality
that could say.

1089
01:12:40.977 --> 01:12:42.565
"Okay. fuck this!

1090
01:12:42.702 --> 01:12:44.981
This can't all be bad.

1091
01:12:45.119 --> 01:12:48.674
I've got to do something good
with this time in my life

1092
01:12:49.779 --> 01:12:54.646
and change the path
of artists' lives."

1093
01:12:54.784 --> 01:12:58.063
One of Britain's most successful
pop singers. George Michael.

1094
01:12:58.201 --> 01:13:00.341
is today asking a High Court
judge to declare

1095
01:13:00.478 --> 01:13:03.171
his recording contract null
and void.

1096
01:13:03.309 --> 01:13:06.382
He says the contract
with Sony Music
is too restrictive

1097
01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.901
and that the company takes
too much of the profits.

1098
01:13:09.039 --> 01:13:11.904
MICHAEL: The deal that I
was working from

1099
01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:13.975
was based
upon the original deal

1100
01:13:14.112 --> 01:13:17.358
which I had signed
with Andrew.
under duress.

1101
01:13:17.496 --> 01:13:23.985
And it recorded a demo
of "Careless Whisper".
"Club Tropicana". "Wham Rap".

1102
01:13:24.123 --> 01:13:27.161
The head of the record company
of Innervison

1103
01:13:27.299 --> 01:13:31.889
turns up with these contracts
and we went to this
greasy spoon cafe.

1104
01:13:32.028 --> 01:13:35.100
And he said "Look.
if you don't sign this now.
the deal is going away.

1105
01:13:35.237 --> 01:13:38.034
"You won't have finished demos
to take away.
you won't own them."

1106
01:13:41.037 --> 01:13:44.143
And we were on our own.
we had nobody with us.
and we signed them.

1107
01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:48.803
When you start a career
with a ridiculous contract

1108
01:13:48.941 --> 01:13:53.187
where someone is paying you
nothing on 12" records.

1109
01:13:53.325 --> 01:13:56.052
one and a half per cent
on the records
that you do sell.

1110
01:13:57.329 --> 01:13:58.813
when you start
from that point.

1111
01:13:58.951 --> 01:14:03.922
you know from that day on
not to trust the industry.

1112
01:14:04.059 --> 01:14:10.135
This was a worldwide.
major artist saying
to a record company

1113
01:14:10.273 --> 01:14:15.451
that the basic contract
which record companies used
was invalid.

1114
01:14:15.589 --> 01:14:18.764
RUSSELL:
If you really fall out
with the people

1115
01:14:18.902 --> 01:14:21.871
who control
your professional life.

1116
01:14:23.838 --> 01:14:25.737
you have a right to walk away.

1117
01:14:25.875 --> 01:14:28.360
I think that is the right
of every individual.

1118
01:14:28.498 --> 01:14:34.780
And the music industry
takes away that right
from every artist it signs.

1119
01:14:34.918 --> 01:14:36.230
George is very. very brave.

1120
01:14:36.368 --> 01:14:38.025
He's not afraid of anybody.

1121
01:14:38.163 --> 01:14:40.199
And he thought
he was being wronged

1122
01:14:40.337 --> 01:14:41.822
and he went out
and fought his own corner.

1123
01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:47.655
What we couldn't do was stand up
and say. "Yeah. you're right.

1124
01:14:47.793 --> 01:14:53.143
"These contracts are slavery
and they shouldn't be allowed.
Your Honor."

1125
01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:54.731
We weren't going to do that!

1126
01:14:54.869 --> 01:14:58.494
You would have artist
after artist queuing up

1127
01:14:58.632 --> 01:15:00.219
to take their record company
into court.

1128
01:15:03.119 --> 01:15:05.708
MICHAEL:
I can't think of one artist
that supported me.

1129
01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:08.193
Not one.

1130
01:15:08.331 --> 01:15:13.474
I know of a lot of artists
who sat back
and waited for the result.

1131
01:15:14.958 --> 01:15:16.339
But that's a different thing.

1132
01:15:18.755 --> 01:15:22.966
ANDY STEPHENS:
Artists like George Michael
come along. if you're lucky.

1133
01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:25.003
once-in-a-lifetime.

1134
01:15:25.141 --> 01:15:29.663
My feelings as the court case
went on were
that we'd lost him.

1135
01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.079
How could you ever patch
that up?

1136
01:15:32.217 --> 01:15:36.290
I'd never let on to George
of the problems

1137
01:15:36.428 --> 01:15:38.499
until after
he'd been in the witness box.

1138
01:15:38.637 --> 01:15:40.984
And I said.
"It's not going well."

1139
01:15:41.121 --> 01:15:45.610
And. you know. you shouldn't
raise your hopes at this stage.

1140
01:15:59.382 --> 01:16:02.419
The pop star George Michael
loses his High Court battle

1141
01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.112
to break away from
his record company. Sony.

1142
01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:08.253
In dismissing the claim.
the judge. Mr. Justice Parker.

1143
01:16:08.391 --> 01:16:12.084
ruled that the contract
was both reasonable and fair.

1144
01:16:12.222 --> 01:16:14.639
The 30-year-old singer
had argued
that the agreement

1145
01:16:14.777 --> 01:16:17.055
was stifling
his artistic development

1146
01:16:17.193 --> 01:16:20.714
and he threatened never
to record for Sony again
if he lost.

1147
01:16:20.852 --> 01:16:23.717
George Michael says
he'll appeal
against the judgment.

1148
01:16:23.855 --> 01:16:26.960
which he said condemned him
to "professional slavery."

1149
01:16:34.279 --> 01:16:38.973
Having received this judgment.
I would like to reiterate
the reasons why

1150
01:16:39.111 --> 01:16:40.871
I embarked
upon these proceedings.

1151
01:16:41.804 --> 01:16:44.392
I have no right to resign.

1152
01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:50.847
In fact. there is no such thing
as resignation for an artist
in the music industry.

1153
01:16:50.985 --> 01:16:55.714
Effectively. you sign a piece
of paper
at the beginning of your career

1154
01:16:55.852 --> 01:16:58.544
and you are expected
to live with that decision.

1155
01:16:58.683 --> 01:17:03.273
good or bad. for the rest
of your professional life.

1156
01:17:03.411 --> 01:17:06.414
I shall obviously take full
advice from my lawyers.

1157
01:17:06.552 --> 01:17:10.073
But the initial view is that
we have very strong grounds
for appeal

1158
01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:13.939
and we hope to have the appeal
heard as quickly as possible.

1159
01:17:14.077 --> 01:17:16.355
Thank you very much for your
time and for all the support

1160
01:17:16.493 --> 01:17:19.358
that I've received since this
action began. Thank you.

1161
01:17:22.085 --> 01:17:23.915
JOURNALIST: George.
will you sing for Sony again?

1162
01:17:33.889 --> 01:17:36.582
After the court case
was finished and I'd lost

1163
01:17:36.721 --> 01:17:39.550
and not just lost.
I lost completely.

1164
01:17:39.689 --> 01:17:41.208
I mean. I lost on everything.

1165
01:17:41.346 --> 01:17:43.175
Every count.

1166
01:17:43.313 --> 01:17:46.005
They then called up and.
you know. kind of said.
"Well. isn't...

1167
01:17:46.144 --> 01:17:47.559
Can't we patch things up?"
kind of thing.

1168
01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:49.803
But I knew in reality
that was like a formality.

1169
01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:51.148
They had to do that.

1170
01:17:52.702 --> 01:17:56.154
But ultimately. the whole thing
was a complete waste of time.

1171
01:17:56.291 --> 01:17:59.260
And I regret it to this day.

1172
01:18:01.297 --> 01:18:05.957
Looking back 25 years on.
my first thought is that
I just think it's sad.

1173
01:18:06.094 --> 01:18:09.512
When you win a court case.
you're normally out there
high-fiving

1174
01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:11.478
and putting the drinks in.

1175
01:18:11.617 --> 01:18:15.621
But I don't think anyone felt.
not on my team anyway.
a sense of euphoria.

1176
01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.831
Certainly. there
were no winners.

1177
01:18:17.969 --> 01:18:21.005
I mean. we won the court case.
but we didn't win anything.

1178
01:18:21.144 --> 01:18:25.735
You've actually lost
because you've lost the support
of that artist.

1179
01:18:25.873 --> 01:18:30.947
TONY: George said in passing.
"David Frost wants to do
an interview with me."

1180
01:18:31.085 --> 01:18:32.811
And I said.
"You've got to do it.

1181
01:18:32.949 --> 01:18:35.365
They know you're a man
of principle.

1182
01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:39.680
Now. you've got to be a man
of principle
who's totally obsessed."

1183
01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:43.063
Well...

1184
01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:46.791
What happens now
is that we go to appeal.

1185
01:18:46.929 --> 01:18:49.276
I can't see
any other way around it.

1186
01:18:49.414 --> 01:18:51.243
I mean. of course.
there is the ultimate option

1187
01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:55.489
that an appeal at the House
of Lords.
which would take forever.

1188
01:18:55.627 --> 01:18:57.111
It was all bluff.

1189
01:18:57.249 --> 01:19:02.392
I mean. they intended to take it
to the Court of Appeal
in the UK.

1190
01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:06.431
Never to the House of Lords.
never to the European Court
of Justice.

1191
01:19:06.568 --> 01:19:09.952
They can only lose
by going to appeal.

1192
01:19:10.090 --> 01:19:11.746
Everybody was watching.

1193
01:19:13.438 --> 01:19:15.302
including David Geffen.

1194
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.925
No-one was going to let a talent
like that flounder out there
for very long.

1195
01:19:19.064 --> 01:19:24.690
So. David Geffen
contacts Sony
and said to them.

1196
01:19:24.829 --> 01:19:26.554
"Listen. guys.

1197
01:19:26.692 --> 01:19:32.698
he's never. ever going to make
another piece of music
for you ever."

1198
01:19:32.837 --> 01:19:34.252
"You might as well let him go."

1199
01:19:38.739 --> 01:19:41.327
I flew to New York.
had a very quick
meeting there.

1200
01:19:41.466 --> 01:19:44.987
where basically. you know.
we agreed that the contract
would be sold.

1201
01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:47.644
I was like in seventh heaven.

1202
01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:51.200
TONY: Sony said.
"We want
this transfer fee" and

1203
01:19:51.338 --> 01:19:53.754
it would've bought you
a top class footballer.

1204
01:19:53.892 --> 01:19:56.481
In fact. it most probably
even bought you Lionel Messi
in those days.

1205
01:19:56.619 --> 01:20:01.210
RUSSELL: In the end. he did
whatever he did
with David Geffen and Virgin

1206
01:20:01.348 --> 01:20:04.903
and basically
he bought himself
out of the contract.

1207
01:20:05.041 --> 01:20:07.906
Was it a good decision
in hindsight of history?

1208
01:20:08.044 --> 01:20:09.287
I'm not sure.

1209
01:20:09.425 --> 01:20:14.844
George unquestionably
lost the battle but won the war.

1210
01:20:14.982 --> 01:20:17.088
Because he got the freedom
that he craved for.

1211
01:20:17.226 --> 01:20:18.710
'Cause he felt he had
to get away.

1212
01:20:23.577 --> 01:20:25.130
Peace to George Michael.

1213
01:20:28.168 --> 01:20:29.272
Peace.

1214
01:20:35.139 --> 01:20:40.076
MICHAEL:
I think the whole experience
of losing Anselmo.

1215
01:20:40.214 --> 01:20:42.976
the period of grief.
roughly two years.

1216
01:20:43.114 --> 01:20:44.874
that I didn't write a note
of music...

1217
01:20:45.771 --> 01:20:48.636
And then.
the absolute knowledge

1218
01:20:48.773 --> 01:20:51.156
that the next album
I was going to write

1219
01:20:51.294 --> 01:20:54.159
would be about grief
and recovery.

1220
01:20:56.264 --> 01:21:00.234

1226
01:21:22.014 --> 01:21:24.465
I sat at a keyboard.

1227
01:21:28.262 --> 01:21:31.541
played a very simple
string part.

1228
01:21:34.475 --> 01:21:38.617
added a very.
very gentle guitar part.

1229
01:21:38.755 --> 01:21:41.897
And my way of making music
is very strange.

1230
01:21:42.035 --> 01:21:44.037
It's very strange.

1231
01:21:44.175 --> 01:21:47.937
Generally. I put
my backing tracks together
very simply on keyboards.

1232
01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:54.633
In this case. I think.
I've added a little guitar.

1233
01:21:57.188 --> 01:22:00.225
But the moment I think
there is something coming.

1234
01:22:00.362 --> 01:22:02.745
there is something
important coming.

1235
01:22:02.883 --> 01:22:08.061
I shove everybody
out of the room. I go in.

1236
01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:14.999
And then I just sing
on repeat. repeat.
repeat. repeat.

1237
01:22:17.277 --> 01:22:20.073
I sing. and I sing.
and I sing.

1238
01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:24.387
This whole total stream
of consciousness rubbish

1239
01:22:24.525 --> 01:22:29.875
that people would laugh
their heads off if they heard
what I was singing.

1240
01:22:32.671 --> 01:22:37.193
And then. I sang
"Like Jesus to a Child".

1241
01:22:40.196 --> 01:22:41.370
Simple as that.

1242
01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.308
And I thought. "Oh. my God.

1243
01:22:48.791 --> 01:22:49.895
That's him.

1244
01:22:50.034 --> 01:22:52.036
That's him and me.

1245
01:22:53.175 --> 01:22:55.004
Like Jesus to a child."

1246
01:23:00.216 --> 01:23:03.840
Then I was so excited
that I'd finally
been able to put my feelings

1247
01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.981
about Anselmo into words.

1248
01:23:08.673 --> 01:23:10.639
And within a week
of writing it.

1249
01:23:10.778 --> 01:23:13.228
I was singing it in front
of the Brandenburg Gate.

1250
01:23:13.367 --> 01:23:16.232

on the mend from my mother.
it was just constant fear.

I felt it was something
different to grief.

It was on top of grief
because I was grieving
for my mother still.

01:48:21.564 --> 01:48:24.187
I think two things. One...

1664
01:48:24.325 --> 01:48:27.466
You know.
great singer-songwriter
from a period of time

1665
01:48:27.603 --> 01:48:31.746

will be seen again. you know?

1666
01:48:31.884 --> 01:48:35.267
I don't think youth culture
will produce people like

myself and Madonna and Prince.

1668
01:48:37.752 --> 01:48:39.684

to do that anymore.

1669
01:48:40.824 --> 01:48:42.585
I think it's too fragmented now.

1670
01:48:42.723 --> 01:48:45.864
So. I'd like to be remembered
as one of those last.

kind of big stars
in the sense that there
was a certain glamour to it.

1672
01:48:52.835 --> 01:48:55.459
But really.
it's just the songs.

1673
01:48:55.598 --> 01:48:57.531

of me

1674
01:48:57.669 --> 01:49:00.223
as someone who had
some kind of integrity.

1675
01:49:00.361 --> 01:49:02.950

for that in a way.

1676

been a waste of time.
