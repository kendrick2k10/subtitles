3
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:50.801
Fore!

4
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.142
Let's go. Marcie.

5
00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.894
I've got to get in some practice

6
00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:03.730
if I'm going to win
our school's golf tournament.

7
00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.399
I'll be right there. sir.

8
00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:28.213
It's a good day for some practice. sir.

9
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:31.592
Looks like you have some fans.

10
00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:36.138
If they're looking to learn about golf.
they've come to the right place.

11
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.143
If she can't read the greens.
I don't like her chances.

12
00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:44.730
It's who you have on the bag that matters.

13
00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:47.649
With Marcie on her side. she'll be fine.

14
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:52.029
Bend at your waist. sir.
You look like a duck.

15
00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.573
Blunt. but honest.

16
00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.789
See? Good caddie. good game.

17
00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:39.409
That kid with the big nose
is going to be tough to beat.

18
00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.411
Don't let him get to you. sir.

19
00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:45.916
If you want to win the qualifying match
and have a chance to play in the big game.

20
00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.585
you need to keep your head clear.

21
00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.712
That's why you're my caddie. Marcie.

22
00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:52.297
You keep me on track.

23
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.842
Perhaps you should practice
your bunker game.

24
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:00.764
Championships can be won
or lost in the sand.

25
00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.729
Try to carry the sand
where you want the ball to go.

26
00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:12.317
"Try to carry the sand"?
That's never going to work.

27
00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:21.785
Good call. Marcie.

28
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.886
Behold.
the Pinecrest Elementary School Cup.

29
00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.722
Check out the past champions.

30
00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.558
"Bunker Billie. Driver Davey."

31
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.895
And soon. "Peppermint Patty"
will be on that cup.

32
00:03:48.604 --> 00:03:51.190
I don't see any mention of the caddies.

33
00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:53.734
Why would they mention the caddies?

34
00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:57.196
May I remind you. sir.
golf is a team sport.

35
00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:01.450
It sure is. Me. myself and I.

36
00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:07.289
Maybe you. yourself and you can carry
your own bag from now on. sir.

37
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.542
Stop calling me sir.

38
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.504
President coming through.

39
00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:15.339
Sign this. Mr. President.

40
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.757
Juice box. Mr. President?

41
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.634
Smile for the school newspaper!

42
00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:22.930
My fellow students.

43
00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:26.475
as my term as your class president
is coming to a close.

44
00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:30.562
I am here to remind you to vote
in the upcoming student council election.

45
00:04:30.646 --> 00:04:35.025
Yes. don't forget to vote for yours truly.

46
00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.362
-because I just threw my hat in the ring.
-Hey!

47
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:40.864
I'm running too.

48
00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:44.868
My campaign is
"Cleanliness is Friendliness."

49
00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:46.036
What?

50
00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:49.748
Politics is about defying expectations.

51
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.875
You like to help people.

52
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.752
You definitely helped me on the green.

53
00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.755
I think you'd make a great president.

54
00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.590
Me? President?

55
00:05:00.384 --> 00:05:02.678
I like having time to myself.

56
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:06.223
If I were president.
I'd never have a moment of peace.

57
00:05:08.392 --> 00:05:09.393
Hello?

58
00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:13.564
I'd always be surrounded by people.

59
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:18.110
I'd have to give big speeches
in front of huge crowds.

60
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.778
Over here. Marcie.

61
00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.406
And I'd have to make snap decisions

62
00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.783
without anytime to formulate my thoughts.

63
00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:26.243
Enough!

64
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.208
I can't imagine anything worse
than being president.

65
00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:34.543
No. thank you.

66
00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.295
I guess that makes sense.

67
00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.589
You once told me you were an invertebrate.

68
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.133
I think you mean "introvert." sir.

69
00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:42.509
That's the one.

70
00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.268
Okay. Marcie. I get your point.

71
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:55.731
but if I don't use the driver
on the fifth hole. I--

72
00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:58.358
Hey! What's going on here?

73
00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:00.194
Didn't you hear?

74
00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:03.238
The cafeteria
finally started serving pizza.

75
00:06:03.322 --> 00:06:05.741
Pizza? My favorite.

76
00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:07.159
Let's go!

77
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.331
After you.

78
00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:20.005
There you are. Marcie.
I'll save you a seat.

79
00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.800
What do you mean they ran out of pizza?

80
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.763
All that's left are bologna sandwiches?

81
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.073
What?

82
00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.962
Here. let me help you. ma'am.

83
00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:01.088
Thank you.

84
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:03.674
Why are the hallways so crowded today?

85
00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:06.927
There's repair work being done
in the west hallway.

86
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.429
and everyone's been rerouted.

87
00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:11.890
The name's Carlin. by the way.

88
00:07:11.974 --> 00:07:13.767
Nice to meet you. Carlin.

89
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:17.104
Didn't I see you watching the golfers
practicing yesterday?

90
00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:22.985
To be honest. I was studying the caddies.
Especially you.

91
00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:24.820
Do you play much?

92
00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:28.866
No. I lean more into
the challenge of problem-solving.

93
00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:33.412
and golf is one of those games
that with every shot and every lie.

94
00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:36.623
there are challenges that require
a solution.

95
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:38.876
I just love it.

96
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.545
Speaking of challenges.

97
00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:44.840
it looks like we're all having trouble
playing through.

98
00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:50.053
I guess we're going to be late.

99
00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:53.599
Such is the fate of the lowerclassmen.

100
00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.143
"Once more unto the breach!"

101
00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.065
It was nice talking with you. ma'am.

102
00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:15.871
Sorry.

103
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:21.001
Italy? I know this.

104
00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:24.213
It's the country that looks like a boot.

105
00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.089
Here it is.

106
00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.429
Stop that right now. you blockhead!

107
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.599
That screeching!

108
00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.269
It's all in the way
he's holding the chalk.

109
00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:42.105
I should go help.

110
00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:46.109
I can't do that in front of everyone.

111
00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.696
Better if I wait and show him after class.

112
00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:54.535
Someone needs to show him
what he's doing wrong.

113
00:08:54.618 --> 00:08:55.911
Right now!

114
00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:04.711
-What is she doing?
-Why is Marcie up there?

115
00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:07.965
What am I doing up here?

116
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:12.761
I just came up to sharpen my pencil.

117
00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:19.101
That is correct.
I did forget my pencil at my desk.

118
00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.310
Never mind.

119
00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:41.915
You should have seen what those poor
kids have to go through in the hallway.

120
00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:45.335
They can barely take a step
without getting knocked over.

121
00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:50.090
And how come there isn't enough pizza
to go around?

122
00:09:50.174 --> 00:09:54.178
Someone has to do something. but who?

123
00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:59.516
Why not me?

124
00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:13.197
The problem is. too many students
are using the same hallway

125
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.615
at the same time.

126
00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:18.952
If the traffic flow could be directed…

127
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:25.334
it would be a less chaotic
and safer situation for everyone.

128
00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.711
Speaking of direction.

129
00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:32.174
perhaps everyone's looking at
the pizza shortage from the wrong one.

130
00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:37.679
I just need to look at it
from a different angle.

131
00:10:48.482 --> 00:10:50.317
This is sure to work.

132
00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:57.241
Hey. You made it.

133
00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:03.789
Excuse me.
I need to talk to the lunch lady.

134
00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:06.500
-I think I figured out--
-No buttinskies!

135
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.001
Of course.

136
00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:12.005
-Do you mind if I--
-No butts. no cuts. no coconuts!

137
00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:18.387
I'll just wait my turn.

138
00:11:22.266 --> 00:11:25.477
That's it. folks.
They're all out of pizza.

139
00:11:42.953 --> 00:11:46.540
Okay. everyone. Stand by. I have a plan.

140
00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:50.210
Time to give everyone a little direction.

141
00:11:55.424 --> 00:11:57.217
-Hey!
-Watch where you're going.

142
00:11:57.301 --> 00:11:59.803
-Who does she think she is?
-Do you mind? Hey!

143
00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:00.929
Look out!

144
00:12:05.976 --> 00:12:08.645
I guess school's a bit tougher than golf.

145
00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:10.689
Better luck next time.

146
00:12:28.749 --> 00:12:29.917
Lucy for president.

147
00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.835
Here. have a button.

148
00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:34.171
Excuse me. Lucille.

149
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:37.341
-I have a problem I'd like to discuss.
-Just a sec.

150
00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:42.137
Five cents. please.

151
00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:46.266
Now. tell me what's on your mind.

152
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.852
I want to learn how to do what you do.

153
00:12:49.353 --> 00:12:53.273
Dealing with new people.
pushing yourself into crowds.

154
00:12:53.357 --> 00:12:55.442
I don't like doing those things.

155
00:12:55.526 --> 00:12:59.238
and I'm worried it's keeping me from
accomplishing what I want to do.

156
00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:01.823
Yes.

157
00:13:01.907 --> 00:13:04.284
So what you're saying is.

158
00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:07.996
you wanna be exactly like me.

159
00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:11.875
-Is it too late to get my nickel back?
-We should role-play.

160
00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:14.419
I'll pretend to be you. and you be me.

161
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.630
Now. come sit here.

162
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:20.676
Straighter. I have very good posture.

163
00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.052
Glasses. please.

164
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:27.307
Remember. I'm you.

165
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.520
Gee. Lucy. you're so smart.

166
00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:35.399
Can you really help me be more like you?

167
00:13:39.236 --> 00:13:45.784
Tell me that if I want to make
a bold impression. I should speak up.

168
00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:46.869
Excuse me?

169
00:13:46.952 --> 00:13:48.745
Tell me to speak up!

170
00:13:49.955 --> 00:13:52.082
You should speak up?

171
00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:58.297
I'm afraid this may require
a series of sessions.

172
00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:00.924
Is this time usually good for you?

173
00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:02.259
Time…

174
00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:04.761
It's the qualifying game.

175
00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.931
I hope you have a lot of nickels.

176
00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:11.226
On the first tee. Peppermint Patty.

177
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.394
Hello. sir.

178
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.980
Hey. Marcie. What do you like here?

179
00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:16.231
A 5-iron?

180
00:14:16.315 --> 00:14:20.485
Actually. with the wind at your back.
I like a 6-iron.

181
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.946
Great idea. Marcie.

182
00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:29.369
On to 16th.

183
00:14:38.504 --> 00:14:41.006
It all comes down to the 18th hole.

184
00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.633
and we're all tied up.

185
00:14:49.515 --> 00:14:50.891
Rats!

186
00:14:57.648 --> 00:15:01.276
That kid with the big nose is here.
scoping out the competition.

187
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.278
Well. I'll show him.

188
00:15:03.362 --> 00:15:06.323
I land on the green.
and I can make an eagle.

189
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.534
You only have to win by a stroke.

190
00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:11.495
I suggest you go for a safe lay-up shot.

191
00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:27.344
All right!

192
00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.554
Nice work. sir.

193
00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:34.852
It's late in the day.

194
00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:38.730
which means the grass has grown
just enough to slow down the putt.

195
00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.441
Aim over there. sir.

196
00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:58.250
Hooray! We're going to the championship!

197
00:15:58.333 --> 00:15:59.960
Congratulations. sir.

198
00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:02.796
-What a shot.
-Great game.

199
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.049
As class president.
at least for a little while longer.

200
00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:10.137
I want to congratulate our winner.
Peppermint Patty.

201
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.766
She's on her way to the big one.
the Pinecrest Elementary School Cup.

202
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:15.934
One for the paper.

203
00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:20.939
And of course. behind every great golfer
is a great caddie.

204
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.691
Congratulations. Marcie.

205
00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:24.568
-Way to go. Marcie.
-Great work. Marcie.

206
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.904
Why don't you tell the crowd
how you got this far?

207
00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.488
Right now?

208
00:16:29.615 --> 00:16:33.869
Well. I haven't really had the time
to prepare anything.

209
00:16:36.288 --> 00:16:39.708
Speak up. Exactly like me.

210
00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:41.793
I have very good posture.

211
00:16:41.877 --> 00:16:42.920
Speak up!

212
00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:47.049
Golf is a game

213
00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:50.093
with golf balls and the caddie.

214
00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:55.974
and I'm sure Patricia
can field all your questions.

215
00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:15.368
Hello. Charles.

216
00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:16.453
Hello. Marcie.

217
00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.414
May I ask you a question?

218
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.333
What's on your mind?

219
00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:26.713
I was wondering if there's anything about
yourself that you would want to change.

220
00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:32.803
How much time do you have?

221
00:17:39.935 --> 00:17:42.813
There's a lot of people out there
that could use a hand.

222
00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:44.773
and I want to help them.

223
00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:49.862
But when I try to.

224
00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:54.157
I suddenly find myself surrounded by
all these other new people.

225
00:17:57.327 --> 00:18:00.747
And I never get the time
to get my thoughts together.

226
00:18:00.831 --> 00:18:04.001
and all I want to do is run away.

227
00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:09.590
How can I help anyone if I can't even
stick around to say anything?

228
00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:13.594
How can I change?

229
00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:16.430
How can I be different?

230
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.474
I wish I could help you.

231
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.811
I have a hard enough time
just trying to be myself.

232
00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.040
"Be myself."

233
00:18:45.876 --> 00:18:49.796
You know. you can be pretty inspiring
when you want to be. Charles.

234
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.881
Thank you.

235
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.259
Me? Inspiring?

236
00:18:57.763 --> 00:19:00.807
Hey. pal.
looking for a little inspiration?

237
00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:03.602
Well. you've come to the right place.

238
00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:14.196
I can't believe it.
I got a slice of pizza.

239
00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:18.992
Congratulations on getting more pizza
for the school. Franklin.

240
00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:21.370
-Always believed in you. Mr. President.
-Smile for the--

241
00:19:22.246 --> 00:19:25.541
I'm happy about it too.
but I can't take the credit.

242
00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:28.961
If it wasn't you. then who?

243
00:19:32.798 --> 00:19:34.550
Pardon me for snooping.

244
00:19:34.633 --> 00:19:38.220
but it seems you volunteered
for cafeteria duty this morning

245
00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:42.516
and helped them slice the pizza
into eight instead of six

246
00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:44.601
so there'd be more to go around.

247
00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:47.271
Smart move. ma'am.

248
00:19:57.865 --> 00:19:59.074
Par four!

249
00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:03.662
May I be excused early. ma'am?

250
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:12.546
Time to get to work.

251
00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:34.902
There!

252
00:20:45.329 --> 00:20:48.749
On the one hand. it's technically litter.

253
00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:51.543
On the other hand. it's really helpful.

254
00:20:51.627 --> 00:20:54.254
We're going to get to class on time.

255
00:20:54.338 --> 00:20:56.840
Our tardy streak is over.

256
00:20:56.924 --> 00:21:00.093
I never thought
we would live to see the day.

257
00:21:00.636 --> 00:21:02.304
Your work again. ma'am?

258
00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:04.139
Great job.

259
00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.605
My turn again?

260
00:21:14.233 --> 00:21:16.610
Here comes the chalk screecher.

261
00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:18.403
This is for you. Charles.

262
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.325
The fastball grip you have
on the chalk isn't working.

263
00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:25.160
Try your curveball grip.

264
00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:27.162
Worth a shot.

265
00:21:35.254 --> 00:21:37.631
It's a miracle.

266
00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:49.142
Don't forget to vote
in the student council election.

267
00:21:49.226 --> 00:21:50.519
Polls close at noon.

268
00:21:53.397 --> 00:21:55.607
Everyone's in a pretty good mood today.

269
00:21:55.691 --> 00:21:56.900
They are. sir.

270
00:21:56.984 --> 00:22:00.696
Must be all the excitement about
the championship match this afternoon.

271
00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:02.364
You're going to do great.

272
00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:07.327
Can you imagine winning the tournament
with the whole school watching?

273
00:22:07.411 --> 00:22:09.162
The whole school?

274
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.041
I'm just happy to walk
the links with you. sir.

275
00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:18.547
Excuse me. everyone.
I have an announcement to make.

276
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.091
The vote is officially in
for our class president.

277
00:22:21.175 --> 00:22:23.302
The duly elected winner is…

278
00:22:24.303 --> 00:22:25.637
Marcie!

279
00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:27.598
Excuse me?

280
00:22:31.351 --> 00:22:34.646
Nice work. Marcie.
I didn't even know you were running.

281
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.608
-I wasn't. I'm not.
-You have an appointment in an hour.

282
00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:40.027
-Here are some papers to sign.
-Juice box. Madam President?

283
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.737
-What?
-Smile!

284
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.614
How did this happen?

285
00:22:43.697 --> 00:22:44.865
Everyone's been impressed

286
00:22:44.948 --> 00:22:47.159
with the improvements
you've been making to the school.

287
00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:49.411
Looks like we had a lot of write-in votes.

288
00:22:49.494 --> 00:22:53.123
-Wow. class president.
-Aren't you excited?

289
00:22:56.627 --> 00:22:58.837
Going new places.

290
00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:00.339
Meeting new people.

291
00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:04.510
You get to be the one leading the parades!

292
00:23:15.604 --> 00:23:20.567
And when I win the final match.
you'll get to give your first big speech.

293
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:21.652
Marcie!

294
00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:23.987
In front of a whole crowd of people.

295
00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:26.073
Marcie! Marcie! Marcie.

296
00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:28.408
-Lucky you.
-Marcie.

297
00:23:33.747 --> 00:23:36.166
Wow. She's so excited.

298
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.418
Let the world know. Marcie!

299
00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:44.758
This isn't what I wanted at all.

300
00:23:48.971 --> 00:23:49.972
It's okay.

301
00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:53.559
I can't be president
if I never leave this room.

302
00:23:56.812 --> 00:24:00.232
I'm staying here forever.

303
00:24:01.984 --> 00:24:06.154
Welcome to the Pinecrest
Elementary School Championship finals.

304
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:12.244
Where's Marcie?

305
00:24:12.911 --> 00:24:14.663
It's not like her to be late.

306
00:24:15.414 --> 00:24:17.291
I'm going to need a backup caddie.

307
00:24:19.585 --> 00:24:21.461
Hey. Chuck. You busy?

308
00:24:22.254 --> 00:24:23.255
I--

309
00:24:23.338 --> 00:24:26.258
You are now. Here.
I need you to be my caddie.

310
00:24:26.341 --> 00:24:29.344
I don't really know anything about golf.

311
00:24:29.428 --> 00:24:32.347
Just carry my bag
and keep the clubs clean.

312
00:24:32.431 --> 00:24:35.184
Marcie will be here any minute.

313
00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:44.318
All right. I'm set.

314
00:24:45.277 --> 00:24:47.321
I never have to leave this room.

315
00:24:47.905 --> 00:24:49.698
Not for any reason at all.

316
00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:56.788
This one looks nice.

317
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:00.292
This is a putter. Chuck.

318
00:25:00.375 --> 00:25:02.961
You can't use a putter to tee off.

319
00:25:03.045 --> 00:25:05.130
That's pretty basic stuff.

320
00:25:05.214 --> 00:25:07.382
I told you I don't know much about golf.

321
00:25:07.883 --> 00:25:10.594
I was hoping you were just being humble.

322
00:25:10.677 --> 00:25:14.515
My track record of success
doesn't require much humbleness.

323
00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:17.226
Where's Marcie?

324
00:25:22.564 --> 00:25:24.900
Golf is such a strange sport.

325
00:25:24.983 --> 00:25:30.155
Tiny ball. tiny hole. giant field.
It just doesn't add up.

326
00:25:30.989 --> 00:25:32.449
A 9-iron?

327
00:25:32.533 --> 00:25:34.868
Chuck. I asked for the six.

328
00:25:34.952 --> 00:25:37.246
They look exactly the same to me.

329
00:26:01.061 --> 00:26:02.563
I'm worried. Chuck.

330
00:26:03.063 --> 00:26:04.106
About losing?

331
00:26:04.606 --> 00:26:07.901
Sure. That kid with the big nose
is on another level.

332
00:26:07.985 --> 00:26:10.070
But I'm also worried about Marcie.

333
00:26:10.153 --> 00:26:11.905
She never misses a game.

334
00:26:11.989 --> 00:26:13.490
What if something's wrong?

335
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.702
She'll be fine without me.

336
00:26:16.785 --> 00:26:18.996
No one plays better than Patricia.

337
00:26:20.622 --> 00:26:23.292
You don't need my help.
You can win this. sir.

338
00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:25.836
The wind is picking up.

339
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.839
What should my next move be. Chuck?

340
00:26:29.798 --> 00:26:33.760
Well. if golf is anything like baseball.

341
00:26:33.844 --> 00:26:37.472
I'd say there's the flag.
Aim for home plate.

342
00:26:46.356 --> 00:26:47.858
She's losing.

343
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:49.651
-Not possible.
-Not Peppermint Patty.

344
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:53.030
Hey. everyone!

345
00:26:53.113 --> 00:26:55.407
The championship match!

346
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.910
Peppermint Patty's going to lose the game.

347
00:26:57.993 --> 00:27:00.287
-Let's go.
-I have to see this with my own eyes.

348
00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:13.175
How's your day going?

349
00:27:14.259 --> 00:27:15.928
Don't ask me about mine.

350
00:27:24.645 --> 00:27:25.646
Carlin?

351
00:27:28.398 --> 00:27:30.943
Shouldn't you be at the Pinecrest Cup?

352
00:27:31.026 --> 00:27:32.861
That's why I'm here. ma'am.

353
00:27:32.945 --> 00:27:36.448
Peppermint Patty is going to lose
the championship.

354
00:27:36.532 --> 00:27:37.783
That's not possible.

355
00:27:37.866 --> 00:27:39.034
Who's her caddie?

356
00:27:41.328 --> 00:27:42.496
Fore!

357
00:27:44.831 --> 00:27:46.750
Good grief.

358
00:27:47.334 --> 00:27:49.044
She could really use you today.

359
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.964
I want to caddie for Patricia.

360
00:27:52.589 --> 00:27:53.674
I really do.

361
00:27:54.174 --> 00:27:55.926
But I'm class president now.

362
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.178
And if I show up.

363
00:27:58.262 --> 00:28:03.350
I'm going to have to get up in front
of everyone and make a big speech.

364
00:28:03.433 --> 00:28:05.352
And I don't know what to say.

365
00:28:05.435 --> 00:28:10.649
From now on. it's going to be. "rush.
push. pull. don't think. talk."

366
00:28:10.732 --> 00:28:14.987
It makes me feel like I'm drowning.
like I can't catch my breath.

367
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.738
I want to help Patricia.

368
00:28:16.822 --> 00:28:18.115
I really do.

369
00:28:19.116 --> 00:28:19.950
But…

370
00:28:21.493 --> 00:28:22.786
I can't go out there.

371
00:28:25.956 --> 00:28:29.376
Tell me.
what advice would a caddie give someone

372
00:28:29.459 --> 00:28:32.296
that is lying at the bottom
of a 4-inch rough?

373
00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:39.636
I'd say.
"Focus on the shot that's given to you.

374
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.096
Play to your strengths."

375
00:28:41.638 --> 00:28:43.599
What are your strengths. ma'am?

376
00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:47.936
Running away when things get overwhelming?

377
00:28:51.273 --> 00:28:54.818
Remember what you said to me
when I asked if you play golf?

378
00:28:56.737 --> 00:29:02.367
I said that it was more interesting
to observe the challenges

379
00:29:02.451 --> 00:29:05.454
and discover solutions
than it was to play.

380
00:29:05.537 --> 00:29:11.001
See. I think people like you are the glue
that holds things together.

381
00:29:11.627 --> 00:29:16.965
You all work quietly in the background to
make sure that everything runs smoothly.

382
00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:19.593
The world would fall apart without you.

383
00:29:20.302 --> 00:29:23.972
It takes a lot of strength
to carry that responsibility.

384
00:29:25.307 --> 00:29:27.059
I don't feel very strong.

385
00:29:29.895 --> 00:29:32.064
I just don't know what I should do.

386
00:29:35.859 --> 00:29:37.694
It's your call. ma'am.

387
00:29:55.963 --> 00:29:58.131
When did he get a golf cart?

388
00:30:07.975 --> 00:30:11.979
Just give me any old club. Chuck.
It doesn't matter anymore.

389
00:30:13.063 --> 00:30:16.525
Not that one. Charles.
Give her the 5-iron.

390
00:30:17.693 --> 00:30:18.694
Marcie!

391
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.322
Sorry I wasn't here sooner. sir.

392
00:30:22.823 --> 00:30:25.450
If it's not too late. I'd like to help.

393
00:30:25.534 --> 00:30:27.703
Oh. boy. would I ever like that.

394
00:30:27.786 --> 00:30:29.496
Charles. do you mind?

395
00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:31.623
I thought you'd never ask.

396
00:30:32.624 --> 00:30:34.334
Let's win this game. sir.

397
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.261
Pay no attention to the score.

398
00:30:44.344 --> 00:30:45.929
Just keep your head down.

399
00:31:20.339 --> 00:31:23.717
Remember. plan for the best miss.

400
00:31:31.558 --> 00:31:33.560
Let the big dog speak. sir.

401
00:31:50.911 --> 00:31:51.912
This is it. sir.

402
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:53.747
The 18th hole.

403
00:31:54.248 --> 00:31:56.750
If you can make this in two strokes.

404
00:31:57.501 --> 00:31:58.919
the cup is yours.

405
00:32:20.607 --> 00:32:21.775
Now what?

406
00:32:22.818 --> 00:32:23.861
What's the point?

407
00:32:24.444 --> 00:32:26.238
I'll never make it from there.

408
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:27.698
Yes. you will. sir.

409
00:32:28.198 --> 00:32:29.366
Don't give up now.

410
00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:33.871
Remember our practice from a few days ago?

411
00:32:35.038 --> 00:32:38.542
"Carry the sand." Oh. yeah.

412
00:33:16.121 --> 00:33:17.456
Well played. sir.

413
00:33:17.539 --> 00:33:20.501
Thanks. Marcie.
I couldn't have done it without you.

414
00:33:22.002 --> 00:33:25.422
Madam President. are you prepared
for your first big speech?

415
00:33:25.506 --> 00:33:27.216
-What are you going to say?
-Juice box?

416
00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:28.509
Say cheese.

417
00:33:30.052 --> 00:33:33.889
Listen. Marcie. You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

418
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.648
Actually. sir. I do want to.

419
00:33:43.148 --> 00:33:46.693
I just need a few moments alone
to collect my thoughts.

420
00:33:50.072 --> 00:33:53.116
You heard her. everyone.
Give her some space.

421
00:33:55.077 --> 00:33:56.787
See you at the stage. Marcie.

422
00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:12.469
Now it's time for our new class president
to say a few words.

423
00:34:13.887 --> 00:34:16.931
Marcie! Marcie! Marcie!

424
00:34:31.112 --> 00:34:33.739
For my first act as class president.

425
00:34:34.241 --> 00:34:38.203
I want to say congratulations
to my friend Patricia.

426
00:34:41.623 --> 00:34:46.253
For my second act as class president.
I'd like to announce that…

427
00:34:48.755 --> 00:34:50.924
I'm resigning as class president.

428
00:34:51.007 --> 00:34:53.010
-What?
-Can she even do that?

429
00:34:53.552 --> 00:34:56.221
Helping people is important to me.

430
00:34:57.014 --> 00:34:59.391
but I want to do it in my way.

431
00:35:00.017 --> 00:35:01.810
I like being in the background.

432
00:35:01.894 --> 00:35:04.313
That's just the kind of person I am.

433
00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.356
and I like that person.

434
00:35:07.524 --> 00:35:11.570
There was a time when I thought
that if I wanted to help.

435
00:35:11.653 --> 00:35:13.530
I needed to change who I was.

436
00:35:13.614 --> 00:35:17.451
But thanks to some good advice
and inspiration from my friends…

437
00:35:18.035 --> 00:35:19.995
She's talking about me.

438
00:35:20.078 --> 00:35:23.832
…I've learned that I can find my own way
to do things.

439
00:35:24.917 --> 00:35:27.169
The world needs all kinds of people.

440
00:35:28.003 --> 00:35:29.880
So whether you're a natural leader.

441
00:35:30.422 --> 00:35:32.132
or willing to get your hands dirty.

442
00:35:33.091 --> 00:35:35.677
or never give up despite the odds.

443
00:35:36.595 --> 00:35:39.473
or even try your best
to stay out of the spotlight.

444
00:35:40.057 --> 00:35:42.518
all of us can make a real difference.

445
00:35:48.774 --> 00:35:51.985
Marcie! Marcie! Marcie!

446
00:35:59.326 --> 00:36:01.578
You're pretty brave. Marcie.

447
00:36:01.662 --> 00:36:04.039
Thank you. sir. I'm glad I did that.

448
00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.792
And I'm glad I don't have to do it again.

449
00:36:07.709 --> 00:36:11.213
I hope that kid with the big nose
isn't taking my win too hard.

450
00:36:11.839 --> 00:36:13.590
He sure hates losing.

451
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.054
Yay!

452
00:36:34.027 --> 00:36:36.530
Can you believe Pigpen came in second?

453
00:36:36.613 --> 00:36:38.657
Who on earth voted for Pigpen?

454
00:36:40.325 --> 00:36:42.744
I just thought he ran a clean campaign.

455
00:36:46.081 --> 00:36:47.791
My fellow students.

456
00:36:47.875 --> 00:36:51.336
it is said that the key
to a great democracy

457
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.714
is a great suggestion box.

458
00:36:55.799 --> 00:36:59.261
Suggestion box. huh?
I'll bet that was your idea.

459
00:36:59.344 --> 00:37:01.680
-Nice work.
-Thank you. sir.

460
00:37:01.763 --> 00:37:04.183
I've got a lot more where that came from.

461
00:37:04.266 --> 00:37:05.893
I'm sure you do.

462
00:37:05.976 --> 00:37:08.604
Well. I'm off to my pickup game.

463
00:37:08.687 --> 00:37:10.480
See you in class. Marcie.

464
00:37:10.564 --> 00:37:13.400
Don't forget to follow through
on your jump shot. sir.

465
00:37:13.483 --> 00:37:16.236
Thanks. Marcie. And don't call me sir.
