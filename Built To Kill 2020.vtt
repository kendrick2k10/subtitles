184
00:36:21.399 --> 00:36:24.177
No. it's my responsibility
to make sure you're okay.

185
00:36:24.477 --> 00:36:29.610
I don't need you to make sure I'm okay.
I need to grow up.

186
00:36:29.619 --> 00:36:32.434
But you have grown up. Fifi.

187
00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.977
Does it look like I've grown up?

188
00:36:36.523 --> 00:36:38.589
Look at this.
Look at me.

189
00:36:40.189 --> 00:36:45.253
I'm sorry. I just want everything to be
like it was before.

190
00:36:49.585 --> 00:36:52.318
Well. that's not going to happen. is it?

191
00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:59.460
Actually. you need to grow up.
I'm not your little girl anymore.

192
00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.812
All my life I've only done
what's best for you.

193
00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:13.302
I gave up everything to raise you.
And what do I get in return?

194
00:37:16.402 --> 00:37:18.890
Nothing!

195
00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:23.880
So you know what. Phoebe?

196
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:29.420
If you want to be treated like an adult.
start making your own decisions for once

197
00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.544
rather than me making them for you.

198
00:37:31.544 --> 00:37:33.407
I will.

199
00:37:34.407 --> 00:37:36.583
[body hits the floor]

200
00:38:08.514 --> 00:38:09.555
[shard hits flesh]

201
00:38:10.516 --> 00:38:13.532
[panting]

202
00:39:29.306 --> 00:39:31.234
[electric knife whirs]

203
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.411
[electric knife cuts through flesh]

204
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.685
I've got her.

205
00:41:45.951 --> 00:41:47.800
I've got her. Please!

206
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.317
I've got her...

207
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:09.233
[sobbing]

208
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.259
[water running]

209
00:45:18.203 --> 00:45:19.316
Ruby.

210
00:45:20.355 --> 00:45:22.596
Ruby. could you talk to me?

211
00:45:24.677 --> 00:45:26.245
What do you want me to say?

212
00:45:26.245 --> 00:45:27.862
I came out here to help you.

213
00:45:27.862 --> 00:45:31.030
You cut me out of your life. and
then you call me out of nowhere

214
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:34.055
and you want me to just sit here
like we’re not even going to -

215
00:45:34.055 --> 00:45:35.105
I know. OK!

216
00:45:35.105 --> 00:45:37.657
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to say?

217
00:45:37.657 --> 00:45:39.574
I’m sorry that I made you come
down here.

218
00:45:39.574 --> 00:45:41.496
I’m sorry that any of this
is happening.

219
00:45:41.496 --> 00:45:44.427
I’m sorry that I’m such a fucking doormat!
- Oh. there it is!

220
00:45:44.427 --> 00:45:45.880
Fuck you. Charlie!

221
00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:46.844
Punch me!
- No!

222
00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:48.785
Seriously. come on.
Punch me in the face.

223
00:45:48.785 --> 00:45:50.821
I’m not going to do that.
- Come on. Rubes.

224
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:53.685
Mom’s not here. You’re not going to
get in trouble. Come on.

225
00:45:53.685 --> 00:45:54.815
Come on.

226
00:45:54.815 --> 00:45:56.573
Stop it. Stop it!

227
00:45:56.573 --> 00:45:58.875
Stop it! What is wrong with you?!?

228
00:45:58.875 --> 00:46:01.295
Come on!
- You are such a fucking child!

229
00:46:01.966 --> 00:46:03.379
Fuck you.

230
00:46:57.211 --> 00:46:59.141
Thought you quit.

231
00:46:59.923 --> 00:47:01.874
Sarah left.

232
00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.951
You guys broke up?

233
00:47:03.951 --> 00:47:06.939
Yeah. she called me heartless.
packed up her shit.

234
00:47:06.939 --> 00:47:10.868
Took my fucking french press
and never looked back.

235
00:47:11.634 --> 00:47:12.985
Jesus.

236
00:47:13.392 --> 00:47:15.422
I deserved it.
I can be a dick.

237
00:47:16.347 --> 00:47:18.500
Can’t argue with that.

238
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.486
You’re just scared.

239
00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.477
I’m not afraid of nothing.

240
00:47:29.908 --> 00:47:33.105
Sharks.
- Yeah. except that.

241
00:47:33.442 --> 00:47:35.340
Apples.
- Disgusting.

242
00:47:35.681 --> 00:47:38.660
And commitment.
- Hey!

243
00:47:39.212 --> 00:47:42.453
You remember that one time I scared
you so bad you peed your pants?

244
00:47:42.902 --> 00:47:44.756
Yes. I remember that.

245
00:47:44.756 --> 00:47:46.555
That was fucking incredible.

246
00:47:46.555 --> 00:47:48.667
I don’t know why you’re so proud of that.

247
00:47:48.667 --> 00:47:53.331
You screamed like a baby goat
just fucking dying a long painful death.

248
00:47:59.954 --> 00:48:03.110
Remember how we used to
play fairies here?

249
00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:06.403
And you told me that there were druids
in the woods.

250
00:48:06.403 --> 00:48:10.582
And gnomes in the caves.
And we. like. left potions for them.

251
00:48:10.582 --> 00:48:12.787
And we cast spells and stuff?

252
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.767
No.

253
00:48:16.322 --> 00:48:18.558
You don’t remember that?

254
00:48:23.293 --> 00:48:25.918
You are heartless.

255
00:48:26.713 --> 00:48:28.362
You see?

256
00:48:35.451 --> 00:48:37.905
It’s freezing.

257
00:48:46.266 --> 00:48:48.951
Fire fill my heart

258
00:48:49.203 --> 00:48:51.607
With a vital force

259
00:48:51.672 --> 00:48:53.896
Bring us light in the night

260
00:48:53.982 --> 00:48:57.972
And the warmth of an embrace

261
00:49:02.761 --> 00:49:07.272
Fire fill my heart

262
00:49:08.229 --> 00:49:11.925
With a vital force

263
00:49:12.861 --> 00:49:17.578
Bring us light in the night

264
00:49:19.389 --> 00:49:23.460
And the warmth of an embrace

265
00:49:23.795 --> 00:49:28.295
Fire fill my heart

266
00:49:28.911 --> 00:49:33.829
With a vital force

267
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.950
With a vital force
Bring us light in the night

268
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:38.445
Bring us light in the night

269
00:49:40.446 --> 00:49:44.745
And the warmth of an embrace

270
00:49:58.576 --> 00:50:00.801
Wait. Charlie!

271
00:50:01.649 --> 00:50:04.755
Come on! Let’s go!

272
00:51:49.629 --> 00:51:52.745
Ruby! Hey. Hey.

273
00:51:57.899 --> 00:52:01.399
I can’t! I can’t!

274
00:52:01.399 --> 00:52:03.884
We’re going to get through this.

275
00:52:03.884 --> 00:52:05.490
I promise you.

276
00:53:07.341 --> 00:53:10.873
Fire fill my heart

277
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:15.880
With a vital force

278
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:20.780
Bring us light tin the night

279
00:53:22.449 --> 00:53:25.850
And the warmth of your embrace

280
00:53:26.215 --> 00:53:29.149
Fire fill my heart

281
00:53:29.554 --> 00:53:33.230
With a vital force

282
00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.848
Bring us light in the night

283
00:53:37.795 --> 00:53:41.501
And the warmth of your embrace

284
00:53:41.501 --> 00:53:41.910
And the warmth of your embrace
Fire fill my heart

285
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:44.972
Fire fill my heart

286
01:00:16.282 --> 01:00:18.240
Come on!

287
01:00:19.629 --> 01:00:22.395
Come on. come on!

288
01:00:26.355 --> 01:00:29.728
Yes. yes. yes!

289
01:02:42.737 --> 01:02:44.553
Don't be nervous.

290
01:02:44.749 --> 01:02:47.862
Nervous is not a good look
on such a pretty face.

291
01:02:50.144 --> 01:02:52.826
I've never done
anything like this before.

292
01:02:53.863 --> 01:02:55.736
Then be attentive.

293
01:02:56.497 --> 01:02:58.607
What are your ambitions?

294
01:02:58.607 --> 01:03:00.657
What have you done that has led you here?

295
01:03:00.964 --> 01:03:04.460
I want you to be honest with me. Evelyn.

296
01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:10.510
As I said on the phone.
I had to make some choices.

297
01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:12.580
It all felt so...

298
01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:14.858
Unreal.

299
01:03:15.598 --> 01:03:18.164
I want you to elaborate.

300
01:03:18.164 --> 01:03:18.490
I want you to elaborate.
When did you decide these were
choices you needed to make?

301
01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:21.509
When did you decide these were
choices you needed to make?

302
01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.297
Um...

303
01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:29.564
I guess it all started
with my sister. Delilah.

304
01:03:39.224 --> 01:03:41.590
Food smells good.

305
01:03:42.846 --> 01:03:44.891
Ev. you doin' okay?

306
01:03:46.459 --> 01:03:48.259
What's wrong?

307
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.956
Nobody's here. it's like
they're afraid of her.

308
01:03:57.445 --> 01:04:00.357
We're here for you. okay?

309
01:05:29.454 --> 01:05:31.991
Ev. this is incredible.

310
01:05:42.794 --> 01:05:45.910
I knew it wasn't an accident.

311
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:49.318
But it's kind of sick though. isn't it?

312
01:05:50.621 --> 01:05:52.278
But everybody liked it.

313
01:05:52.278 --> 01:05:54.170
They liked...

314
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:55.367
They liked me.

315
01:05:57.788 --> 01:06:01.155
It's not normal. you understand?

316
01:06:01.505 --> 01:06:02.455
Yes.

317
01:06:05.224 --> 01:06:08.107
It was only supposed to
be a temporary solution.

318
01:06:09.907 --> 01:06:12.447
So of course you couldn't
keep mutilating yourself.

319
01:07:06.504 --> 01:07:08.684
Do you like it. the tomato sauce?

320
01:07:09.318 --> 01:07:10.635
Yeah. yeah.

321
01:07:10.635 --> 01:07:12.130
It was good.

322
01:07:13.877 --> 01:07:15.710
It was a new recipe.

323
01:07:17.216 --> 01:07:19.831
Isn't it just...tomatoes?

324
01:07:23.633 --> 01:07:25.555
Sorry. Ev. I was...

325
01:07:25.555 --> 01:07:27.154
I was kidding.

326
01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.659
That's the cake we had the other day.

327
01:07:35.659 --> 01:07:37.535
You know. the one everybody liked?

328
01:07:38.279 --> 01:07:39.472
Mmhmm.

329
01:07:40.503 --> 01:07:41.869
Yeah.

330
01:07:43.167 --> 01:07:47.990
Did you. uh. change something this time?

331
01:07:48.788 --> 01:07:50.789
Yes.

332
01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:52.589
It's good.

333
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:55.808
No. it's good. it's just it tastes um...

334
01:07:56.375 --> 01:07:58.542
Just...it tastes a little different.

335
01:08:01.706 --> 01:08:03.674
I made it... different.

336
01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:19.460
What went wrong?

337
01:08:22.176 --> 01:08:24.176
I thought I knew.

338
01:08:24.176 --> 01:08:26.254
I mean. I did know but...

339
01:08:26.254 --> 01:08:28.309
But you needed to be sure.

340
01:08:28.975 --> 01:08:32.952
I thought everybody was just pretending.
because they felt sorry for me.

341
01:08:34.475 --> 01:08:36.459
What did you do about it?

342
01:08:39.718 --> 01:08:42.224
I have an item for an Evelyn.

343
01:08:42.224 --> 01:08:43.540
Yeah. that's me.

344
01:08:43.806 --> 01:08:45.540
I just need a signature.

345
01:08:54.971 --> 01:08:56.227
Paper cut.

346
01:08:56.227 --> 01:08:57.421
I'm fine.

347
01:08:58.771 --> 01:09:00.920
Afraid of a drop of blood?

348
01:09:04.933 --> 01:09:06.872
You killed him.

349
01:09:07.467 --> 01:09:08.950
No.

350
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.433
Not at first.

351
01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:10.260
Are you an only child?

352
01:11:10.764 --> 01:11:11.934
Now?

353
01:11:14.166 --> 01:11:15.862
I mean. I guess.

354
01:11:16.612 --> 01:11:18.630
My sister...

355
01:11:19.915 --> 01:11:21.772
She killed people...

356
01:11:21.772 --> 01:11:23.311
And herself.

357
01:11:23.892 --> 01:11:25.393
But you're not like her.

358
01:11:27.812 --> 01:11:29.939
I never intended to be.

359
01:11:30.331 --> 01:11:33.161
Do you believe intentions
are all that matter?

360
01:11:33.559 --> 01:11:35.726
They're a good place to start.

361
01:11:38.955 --> 01:11:41.789
How did you find us?

362
01:12:15.936 --> 01:12:17.218
Hello?

363
01:12:19.575 --> 01:12:22.833
Your blood is not like anyone else's.

364
01:12:24.242 --> 01:12:26.580
How does that feel?

365
01:12:27.441 --> 01:12:29.523
It's like...

366
01:12:30.841 --> 01:12:32.841
It's like I'm the only thing that matters.

367
01:12:33.675 --> 01:12:36.753
It's all I want. to be
someone's everything.

368
01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:41.291
And Toby?

369
01:12:42.723 --> 01:12:45.350
We were never really that serious.

370
01:12:46.689 --> 01:12:51.114
Someone like you goes missing.
you're not just forgotten.

371
01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:56.369
You are so special.

372
01:12:58.315 --> 01:13:00.736
What will happen when it's over?

373
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:05.109
Things beyond us. Evelyn.

374
01:13:05.491 --> 01:13:10.415
We indulge. you transcend.

375
01:14:13.017 --> 01:14:15.105
Are you vampires?

376
01:14:17.996 --> 01:14:20.684
Vampires don't exist. Evelyn.

377
01:14:23.088 --> 01:14:24.782
And what will I be?

378
01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.627
Desired.

379
01:14:29.535 --> 01:14:32.385
Everyone will want to be you.

380
01:15:43.934 --> 01:15:48.159
