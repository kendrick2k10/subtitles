I now pronounce you now. now
and forever husband and wife.

- Well.
- Aa!

16
00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:21.619
- I was jus--
- The question Daryl was

17
00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:23.230
for your wife.

18
00:02:23.273 --> 00:02:24.840
You must give her
the opportunity

19
00:02:24.883 --> 00:02:28.539
to express her truth
without interruption.

20
00:02:31.847 --> 00:02:33.065
- Boring.
- Boring?

21
00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.371
- Daryl.

22
00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:35.981
- What?

23
00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:37.809
- Look. we pay you
by the hour. right?

24
00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:40.812
So if she spends more
than half of our time

25
00:02:40.856 --> 00:02:43.598
just to come up with insults.
what are we paying for?

26
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:45.077
We can insult each
other on our own.

27
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.905
- This is why we're here.

28
00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.257
- No. we're here because
the state says we have

29
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.347
to be here in order
to file for divorce.

30
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.392
so let's not pretend
like is anything else.

31
00:02:58.482 --> 00:03:04.140
- Daryl. Lola. the reason
that you are here is.

32
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.489
because in compliance

33
00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:07.839

Preservation Act.

in order to dissolve
your marriage

35
00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:12.583
you must complete therapy first.

36
00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:16.761
- Doesn't say we have to do
it with you though. does it?

37
00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:20.374
- [chuckles] Daryl. you
can choose any therapist

38
00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:24.116
you'd like; however.
good luck getting

39
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.205
an appointment this year.

00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:28.512
This new law has us all swamped.

41
00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:32.777
- We're sorry. Dr. Barrabi.
we're just a little on edge.

42
00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:37.129
- No apologies necessary.

43

Call me Angel.

- Daryl. it's your turn.

46
00:03:44.876 --> 00:03:46.008
- Oh. I get to speak.

47
00:03:47.575 --> 00:03:49.229
What was the question?

48
00:03:49.272 --> 00:03:50.839
What's the sex like?

49
00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:54.146
- I asked your wife to
describe what sex was like

50
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.800
with you using one word.

51
00:03:57.802 --> 00:03:59.282
- And she said boring.

52
00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:03.591
- Daryl. I want you to
express your opinions

53
00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:07.595
and feelings as response
not to your wife.

54
00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:10.815
but as a truth.
honestly speaking to me.

55
00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.262
- Dead fish.

56
00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:26.353
- Daryl. I need you
to use an adjective

57
00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:28.442
to describe what sex
is like with your wife.

58
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:31.662
- I didn't know this
was a English class.

59
00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:39.888
Okay. dead fishy adjective
meaning is like having sex

60
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:40.932
with a dead fish.

61
00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:42.282
- We get it.
- Lola.

62
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:48.636
Okay. Daryl. I understand
what you're trying to say.

63
00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:51.682
Daryl and Lola.
during these sessions

64
00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:55.382
it's really important that you
don't interrupt one another.

65
00:04:56.905 --> 00:05:01.431
You might just discover
something you were unaware of.

66
00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:05.261
Lola. what do you
think Daryl likes most

67
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.524
about the person you are today?

68
00:05:07.568 --> 00:05:10.571
- [scoffs] I don't know. my ass.

69
00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:13.225
- Is that an honest answer.

70
00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:14.183
or is that a sarcastic one?

71
00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:18.100
- Honestly. I don't know.

72
00:05:18.143 --> 00:05:21.582
I mean. when we
first got together

73
00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:23.758
he used to compliment
everything I did. everything.

74
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:29.894
Now I could build a
house from the ground up.

75
00:05:29.938 --> 00:05:31.983
I could get a
promotion on my job.

76
00:05:32.027 --> 00:05:34.203
Hell. I could save the world.

77
00:05:34.246 --> 00:05:36.074
Matter of fact. I could even
suck his dick from the back

78
00:05:36.118 --> 00:05:37.337
and he wouldn't
give me a thumbs up.

79
00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:44.909
so to answer your good question
honestly. my ass maybe.

80
00:05:44.953 --> 00:05:45.867
- Daryl. what do you
think Lola likes most

81
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.998
about the person you are today?

82
00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:50.045
- That's easy she likes the fact

83
00:05:50.088 --> 00:05:51.351
that I make less money than her.

84
00:05:52.917 --> 00:05:54.223
- Is that an honest answer.

85
00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:55.964
or is that a sarcastic one?

86
00:05:56.007 --> 00:05:58.096
- That's a sarcastic answer.

87
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.229
and it's the honest answer.

88
00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:01.709
Look. I'm an accountant.

89
00:06:01.752 --> 00:06:03.145
I hate my job.

90
00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:06.017
but I'm too far into
my career to change.

91
00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:08.280
and I make good money.

92
00:06:08.324 --> 00:06:10.674
but she makes great money.

93
00:06:10.718 --> 00:06:15.287
- I am the only black woman at
my firm I have to represent.

94
00:06:15.331 --> 00:06:17.899
- Anyway. she's always tired.

95
00:06:19.117 --> 00:06:21.642
and the job is the excuse

96
00:06:21.685 --> 00:06:25.950
which is why the
sex is dead fishy.

97
00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:30.477
and I want to divorce
because I don't like fish.

98
00:06:32.957 --> 00:06:34.350

and lamb whatever
else is out there.

100
00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:43.315
- Okay. okay. okay. okay.
I understand the reason

101
00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.580
that you are here is
because you want to divorce.

102
00:06:46.623 --> 00:06:49.321
okay. I get that; however.
during our sessions I asked

103
00:06:49.365 --> 00:06:50.540
that you not use the word.

104
00:06:52.107 --> 00:06:55.197
As you know. it is my
job to bring you back

105
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.417
to marital bliss.

106
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.245
- Good luck with that.
- Good luck with that.

107
00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:01.769
- I'd like to do an
experiment with you.

108
00:07:04.598 --> 00:07:07.165
Have you ever heard
of hypnotherapy?

109
00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:08.036
- Hypnotherapy?

110
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:13.520
- Wait. you mean like you
dangle a watch in front of us.

111
00:07:13.563 --> 00:07:16.000
and then we fall asleep
go to the sunken place

112
00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:17.524
and wake up barking like dog?

113
00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:18.612
Yeah. I'll pass.

114
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.007
- So you believe it works then?

115
00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:24.574
- I think it's a bullshit.

116
00:07:24.618 --> 00:07:28.317
- So you don't believe
I can hypnotize you?

117
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.100
- Definitely not.

118
00:07:30.537 --> 00:07:32.539
- So you have no
reason not to go along

119
00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:35.063
with this bullshit
therapy then. right?

120
00:07:36.673 --> 00:07:39.110
- Wait. wait. wait. I
didn't sign up for this.

121
00:07:41.373 --> 00:07:44.202
- I don't wanna spend
another month trying

122
00:07:44.246 --> 00:07:46.727
to get another appointment
with a different therapist.

123

do you?

124

- No.

125

126

what did you do us?

- Are these tears in my eyes?

149
00:09:44.496 --> 00:09:45.802
- Yeah. mine too.

150
00:09:45.846 --> 00:09:46.716
- Please. please. it's okay.

151
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.805
Please sit down. it's okay.

152

Everything is okay.

153
00:09:49.893 --> 00:09:52.113
You just came out of hypnosis.

154
00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:52.679
It's normal.

155
00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:59.729
The reason I wanted you to
undergo hypnotherapy was

156
00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:02.602
so I could get to the
root of your problems.

157
00:10:02.645 --> 00:10:04.516
and recommend a treatment.

158
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.475
I know it can be a
little disorientating

159
00:10:06.518 --> 00:10:07.781
when you're coming out.

160
00:10:07.824 --> 00:10:09.391
but I promise you.
you won't be barking

161
00:10:09.434 --> 00:10:10.218
like a dog anytime soon.

162
00:10:12.002 --> 00:10:16.616
- Okay doc. you win.
it worked. you happy?

163
00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:18.748
- Are you happy?

164
00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:21.272
How did you feel
when you woke up?

165
00:10:21.316 --> 00:10:21.751
- Sad.
- Sad.

166
00:10:23.884 --> 00:10:25.450
What did you do to us?

167
00:10:25.494 --> 00:10:27.452
What did you make us experience?

168
00:10:28.715 --> 00:10:31.282
- Daryl. do you
wanna know as well?

169
00:10:31.326 --> 00:10:32.153
- Definitely.

170
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:37.114
- Okay. I took you both
through scenario exercise.

171
00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:40.509
In the exercise your mind
constructs a world according

172
00:10:40.552 --> 00:10:41.989
to the guidance the
therapist gives you.

173
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:45.993
- And what was that guidance?

174
00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.910
- I instructed you
to construct a world

175
00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:54.871
where your spouse
simply cease to exist.

176
00:10:54.915 --> 00:10:56.656
and then live in that
world for a year.

177
00:11:08.232 --> 00:11:09.712
- Hell no.

178
00:11:09.756 --> 00:11:11.583
Hell no doc.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

179
00:11:13.281 --> 00:11:15.631
- I appreciate what you just
tried to do and everything.

180
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:19.026
but no. I don't believe it.

181
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:23.683
You probably put like drops
in our eyes to make us cry

182
00:11:23.726 --> 00:11:27.208
when we're asleep
but tell the truth.

183
00:11:27.251 --> 00:11:28.252
I mean. it's a
little far fetched.

184
00:11:28.296 --> 00:11:28.818
I tell you What?

185
00:11:30.428 --> 00:11:33.780
Why don't you just go
ahead and sign this.

186
00:11:33.823 --> 00:11:35.607
and we will be out
of your hair forever.

187
00:11:38.828 --> 00:11:41.526
- What was the last time
you guys watch the news?

188
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.268
- Oh. we don't have cable.

189
00:11:44.312 --> 00:11:47.881
you know. we just watch
it off of the internet.

190
00:11:47.924 --> 00:11:48.708
We're saving money.

191
00:11:49.883 --> 00:11:50.622
- Antenna?

192
00:11:52.537 --> 00:11:55.192
- Too much information
can be a bad thing.

193
00:11:55.236 --> 00:11:55.889
- Newspaper?

194
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.154
- Why are you so worried
about how we get our news?

195
00:12:00.197 --> 00:12:04.854
- Well. the state
just updated the law.

196
00:12:04.898 --> 00:12:07.901
Marriage preservation
effective immediately

197
00:12:07.944 --> 00:12:09.946
any couples seeking dissolution

198
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:15.735
of their marriage must
have 50 hours of therapy.

199
00:12:15.778 --> 00:12:17.214
- 50 hours?
- 50 hours?

200
00:12:17.258 --> 00:12:21.001
- Yeah. 50 hours guys with
the same marriage counselor.

201
00:12:21.044 --> 00:12:25.483
You could move. refile. qualify.

202
00:12:25.527 --> 00:12:26.789
and then get your divorce there.

203
00:12:28.312 --> 00:12:31.315
Yeah.
- Okay doc. realistically.

204
00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:35.145
with your schedule how
long are we talking?

205
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:37.104
- The only reason you got
an appointment with me is

206
00:12:37.147 --> 00:12:38.758
because I had a
couple who reconciled.

207
00:12:40.063 --> 00:12:44.459
so honestly. 49 one hour
treatments will take

208
00:12:44.502 --> 00:12:46.809
about three years.

209
00:12:46.853 --> 00:12:50.944
- Oh. no. no. no. no. I
cannot go another three years

210
00:12:50.987 --> 00:12:52.772
with this man.

211
00:12:52.815 --> 00:12:57.341
- Doc. this is probably
gonna sound like a bribe.

212
00:12:57.385 --> 00:13:01.171
but we have money.

213
00:13:03.043 --> 00:13:05.741
We have about $20.000
saved up and we're looking

214
00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.438
for a place to donate it to.

215
00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:10.659
maybe we could donate
it to for your--

216
00:13:10.702 --> 00:13:13.096
- To your hypnotherapy research.

217
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.923
- Exactly.

218
00:13:15.577 --> 00:13:19.973
- So you want me to compromise
my company. my job for you?

219
00:13:23.715 --> 00:13:25.674
I'm sorry the law is the law.

220
00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:30.418
I may have a solution
to your problem

221
00:13:32.072 --> 00:13:34.074
but it will cost you
in more than money.

222
00:13:34.117 --> 00:13:34.857
- Name your price.

223
00:13:36.467 --> 00:13:39.340
- When was the last time
you all went on a date?

224
00:13:39.383 --> 00:13:40.428
[Lola scoffs]

225
00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:41.559
- It's been a while.

226
00:13:41.603 --> 00:13:43.518
- It's been too long.

227
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:45.085
- Oh. is this my fault?

228
00:13:45.128 --> 00:13:49.959
- Usually I only
recommend this to couples

229
00:13:50.003 --> 00:13:52.919
that I think just need to tweak
their marriage a little bit.

230
00:13:52.962 --> 00:13:56.313
There's an experimental
intensive therapy program.

231
00:13:56.357 --> 00:13:58.011
It's very hush hush.

232
00:13:58.054 --> 00:14:02.754
and it's something
like a couples retreat.

233
00:14:02.798 --> 00:14:06.280
but it's much more intense.

234
00:14:06.323 --> 00:14:08.891
You just want it to be
over and I can see that.

235
00:14:08.935 --> 00:14:14.070
So here's the deal
I am authorized

236
00:14:14.114 --> 00:14:18.596
to offer alternative therapies
in lieu of our visits.

237
00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:36.658
Here's the deal
complete the training.

238
00:14:36.701 --> 00:14:38.878
and you get the paperwork
that's the deal.

239
00:14:43.404 --> 00:14:47.669
- And what happens
if this doesn't work?

240
00:14:47.712 --> 00:14:50.585
I mean. you see how he acts.

241
00:14:50.628 --> 00:14:52.979
what if he can't handle
it and he bails out.

242
00:14:53.022 --> 00:14:54.719
like he bails out
on everything else?

243
00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:57.070
- I don't bail.

244
00:14:58.071 --> 00:14:59.463
I follow through.

245
00:14:59.507 --> 00:15:02.379
I give 100% everything
I do of anything.

246
00:15:02.423 --> 00:15:04.294
I'm worried about her dead
fishing in the operation

247
00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:05.905
and getting us kicked
out for not trying.

248
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:11.519
- Look. you've already
given each other seven years

249
00:15:11.562 --> 00:15:11.954
of your life.

250
00:15:13.608 --> 00:15:14.914
Next week is Valentine's Day.

251
00:15:16.393 --> 00:15:18.918
How about you all go
on your last date?

252
00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:26.926
- It sounds like a shit show.

253
00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:28.492
- Guys. please it's up to you.

254
00:15:28.536 --> 00:15:29.798
you can do the retreat.

255
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:32.409
or you can do 49 more
sessions with me.

256
00:15:32.453 --> 00:15:35.412
or you can stay married
and work out your problems.

257
00:15:35.456 --> 00:15:38.154
but for today our
session is over.

258
00:15:38.198 --> 00:15:40.504
so please make your next
appointment at the desk.

You can touch down right there.

269
00:16:45.482 --> 00:16:46.962
Just put it down right there.

270
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:47.876

Woo. all American.

- Where the hell
are these people?

278

- Hey mommy.

279
00:17:34.357 --> 00:17:35.271
- Hey baby.

280
00:17:35.315 --> 00:17:37.143
Is that DJ?

281
00:17:37.186 --> 00:17:38.796
- No. my man likes
it when I talk to him

282
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.971
like he's five years old.

283
00:17:42.235 --> 00:17:44.324
- Mommy. do I still
have to go to bed

284
00:17:44.367 --> 00:17:46.935
at the same time at
my uncle Glen's house?

285
00:17:46.978 --> 00:17:48.719
- Listen. you've
been a good boy.

286
00:17:48.763 --> 00:17:51.940
and you can stay up
as late as you want

287
00:17:51.983 --> 00:17:54.203
just make sure that it's
okay with uncle Glenn.

288
00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:55.509
Are you behaving.

289
00:17:55.552 --> 00:17:56.814

with your cousins?

You're having fun?
- Yes.

296

pass me to uncle Glen.

- Hello.

299
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:30.239
- Glen. why is my son
asking what an areola is?

300
00:18:30.283 --> 00:18:31.197
- A areola?

301
00:18:32.415 --> 00:18:34.069
- An areola. you know
the titty circle.

302
00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.940
the Oreo on the nipple.

303
00:18:35.984 --> 00:18:38.117
why is he asking about areolas?

304
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.293
- Calm down he
found a dictionary.

305
00:18:40.336 --> 00:18:43.513
Listen. he's asked the
letter A right now.

306
00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:45.863
He asked me and I said.
"No ask your mother."

307
00:18:47.561 --> 00:18:50.259
- Oh. okay.

308
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.827
- Everything okay?

309
00:18:54.394 --> 00:18:58.659
- Yeah. I'm fine I'm
just a little stress.

Thank you so much
for doing this.

We appreciate it.

- Ah anytime siz I got you.

00:19:06.797 --> 00:19:08.582
You and Daryl made a good kid.

314
00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:11.715
but it's a shame
it didn't work out.

For what it's worth
happy Valentine's day.

Come on we outta here man.

- Who the hell is this
Mr. Savelove anyway?

320
00:19:28.341 --> 00:19:31.387
- I don't know. it's
definitely a fake name.

321
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.739
- Sound like an '80s porn star.

322
00:19:37.393 --> 00:19:41.049
- Yeah. like a '80s
James Bond villain.

323
00:19:41.092 --> 00:19:44.183
- With an eye patch and
a long dirty fingernail

324
00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:45.749
on his Pinky.

325
00:19:45.793 --> 00:19:47.882
- Yeah. I know. a
little cat with no hair.

326
00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:53.975
- Like a gollum from "The
Lord of the Ring Gollum King".

327
00:19:54.018 --> 00:19:56.456
- [laughs] Yeah.

328
00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:08.207
- Hello. and Happy
Valentine's Day.

329
00:20:09.817 --> 00:20:12.733
Daryl and Lola congratulations
on your decision

330
00:20:12.776 --> 00:20:16.040
to take the Save Love
Challenge on this special day.

331
00:20:18.347 --> 00:20:21.872
At Save Love Industries
we bring couples together

332
00:20:21.916 --> 00:20:24.397
through experiential therapy

333
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.269
which uses real
life decision making

334
00:20:27.313 --> 00:20:30.229
to reinforce the
essential values

335
00:20:30.272 --> 00:20:32.405
that form the basis
of our relationships.

336
00:20:33.797 --> 00:20:37.584
Today 614 couples have gone

337
00:20:37.627 --> 00:20:40.195
through our
experiential therapy.

338
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.677
As of this day 612
of those couples

339
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.113
are still very happily married.

340
00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:49.117
One couple died in
a tragic accident

341
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.251
and you are couples 614.

342
00:20:53.643 --> 00:20:58.474
That's right. your
experience has already begun.

343
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:02.826
Now beneath the seats
you're sitting in is a box

344
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.306
please pull it out
and open it up.

345
00:21:06.047 --> 00:21:06.700
Oh. go ahead now.

346
00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:14.316
All right. when you open
the box you will find

347
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.493
that there are two truffles.
one for each of you.

348
00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.366
Now these truffles
are nothing more

349
00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:22.324
than a sweet
self-dissolving sedative.

350
00:21:23.934 --> 00:21:27.851
Now experiences here are
necessarily discrete.

351
00:21:27.895 --> 00:21:29.636
so you will take the sedative.

352
00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:33.770
and then you will wake
up in your experience.

353
00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:35.946
The Best of love to
you Daryl and Lola.

[TV goes off]

00:21:52.093 --> 00:21:54.748
[suspense music]

356
00:22:24.604 --> 00:22:25.605
- Oh my God.

357
00:22:26.693 --> 00:22:27.476
where are we?

358
00:22:33.134 --> 00:22:37.356
Shit. [groans]

359
00:22:39.183 --> 00:22:40.707
Where are we?

360
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.187
[suspense music]

361
00:22:54.677 --> 00:22:58.028
- What in the ghetto
"Hunger Games" is this shit?

362
00:22:58.072 --> 00:22:58.681
- Where's my phone?

363
00:23:06.123 --> 00:23:07.560
- What the hell?

364
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:09.910
- Oh my God.

365
00:23:12.042 --> 00:23:15.002
I can't believe I let
you convinced me to
do this dumb shit.

366
00:23:15.045 --> 00:23:17.570
You know. they probably have
already stolen our identities

367
00:23:17.613 --> 00:23:20.007
and emptied our bank
accounts by now.

368
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.269
and left us here to die.

369
00:23:21.312 --> 00:23:23.445
- Oh. so now it's my fault.

370
00:23:23.489 --> 00:23:25.491
- Well. you're the one that
wanted the quick divorce.

371
00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:29.495
- Oh. don't play the
blame game with me.

372
00:23:29.538 --> 00:23:31.801
We wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for you.

373
00:23:31.845 --> 00:23:33.977
- If you're so perfect then

374
00:23:34.021 --> 00:23:36.023
why don't you figure
out a perfect plan

375
00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:37.328
so we can get the
hell out of here

376
00:23:37.372 --> 00:23:39.592
and be done with each
other once and for all.

377
00:23:39.635 --> 00:23:40.680
- Fine.
- Fine.

378
00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:47.338
- Shit.
- Shit.

379
00:23:52.605 --> 00:23:54.041
- Well. we can't stay here.

380
00:23:54.084 --> 00:23:56.565
'cause we'd be crispy
critters by morning.

381
00:23:56.609 --> 00:23:58.175
- Yeah. we probably
have enough water

382
00:23:58.219 --> 00:24:00.830
to lose maybe like
a couple days.

383
00:24:00.874 --> 00:24:02.745
- 24 hours.

384
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:04.530
- Not the way you drink.
- Whatever.

385
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.885
- Daryl?
- What?

386
00:24:11.928 --> 00:24:12.625
- What is that?

387
00:24:14.191 --> 00:24:15.584
Is that a dead body?

388
00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:24.201
- Oh shit!

389
00:24:25.115 --> 00:24:25.812
- Hello.

390
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:28.728
Go look.

391
00:24:36.387 --> 00:24:38.607
[screams]

392
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:51.098
- Oh. blood. blood.
- Okay.

393
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:51.664
Is he dead?

394
00:25:00.542 --> 00:25:01.587
- Definitely dead.

395
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:02.675
definitely dead.
- Oh God.

396
00:25:05.155 --> 00:25:06.330
What in the actual fuck?

397
00:25:08.594 --> 00:25:09.333
Oh my God.

398
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.860
Why did I let Daryl
convince me to do this?

399
00:25:17.907 --> 00:25:18.908
This is not good.

400
00:25:21.476 --> 00:25:23.347
- We gotta figure
out who this guy is.

401
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:25.741
- Well. check and see if
he has an ID or something.

402
00:25:25.785 --> 00:25:28.222
[suspense music]

403
00:25:36.099 --> 00:25:37.318
- All right.

404
00:25:37.361 --> 00:25:37.927
Well. grab it.

405
00:25:49.765 --> 00:25:51.854
- Here. I need your
hacking skills.

406
00:25:51.898 --> 00:25:53.116
- Oh. you need me.

407
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.207
- Just.
- Okay. the phone has like.

408
00:25:58.687 --> 00:26:00.254
a sliver of battery left.

409
00:26:02.212 --> 00:26:03.431
but there's one problem.

410
00:26:04.824 --> 00:26:06.739
it needs facial recognition
to open the phone.

411
00:26:28.978 --> 00:26:29.718
Okay.

412
00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:35.463
Yeah. definitely has like.
two minutes of battery tops.

413
00:26:35.506 --> 00:26:38.118
We can either make a phone call.

414
00:26:38.161 --> 00:26:39.119
or look. there's a message.

415
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.519
Let's see if we make a call
there's the possibility

416
00:26:50.086 --> 00:26:52.262
that the ringing will use
up the rest of the battery?

417
00:26:53.873 --> 00:26:55.875
- Yeah. and I don't know
any phone numbers. do you?

418
00:26:57.006 --> 00:26:58.921
- 911.

419
00:26:58.965 --> 00:27:01.054
- Oh yeah. and what are we
gonna say when they answer?

420
00:27:01.097 --> 00:27:02.098
Ma'am. where are you?

421
00:27:06.668 --> 00:27:08.888
- Yeah. plus. the message
might have some clue

422
00:27:08.931 --> 00:27:11.499
to who the hell this
guy is and where we are.

423
00:27:13.283 --> 00:27:14.415
- Final answer?

424
00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:19.376
- Final answer.

425
00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:21.378
- Okay.

426
00:27:25.034 --> 00:27:26.906
- [Savelove] Hey. Bobby.
this is Mr. Savelove.

427
00:27:26.949 --> 00:27:29.735
Hey. you're just a few hours
late for your check in.

428
00:27:29.778 --> 00:27:31.606
so I thought I'd
check in with you.

429
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.174
and I know this is the
paranoid in me speaking.

430
00:27:34.217 --> 00:27:36.785
but I got a little worried
that maybe your old friends

431
00:27:36.829 --> 00:27:38.831
in Organized Crime had
caught up with you.

432
00:27:38.874 --> 00:27:40.354
Now we know this is a stretch.

433
00:27:40.397 --> 00:27:42.573
because this is the
very reason we send you

434
00:27:42.617 --> 00:27:45.185
on these remote South
American type jobs

435
00:27:45.228 --> 00:27:47.013
to keep you safe
from these people.

436
00:27:47.056 --> 00:27:50.103
and obviously if you're
gonna start an experience

437
00:27:50.146 --> 00:27:52.105
in a remote location you
might not have the signal.

438
00:27:52.148 --> 00:27:55.412
So you know what. I'm just
gonna let you do this operation

439
00:27:55.456 --> 00:27:57.284
with no training wheels.

440
00:27:57.327 --> 00:28:00.069
Enjoy your weekend
with Daryl and Lola.

441
00:28:00.113 --> 00:28:01.854
They're pretty much
doomed to fail.

442
00:28:01.897 --> 00:28:04.900
but you know. we
can't win them all.

443
00:28:04.944 --> 00:28:07.860
We will see you all in the
rendezvous point on Monday.

444
00:28:07.903 --> 00:28:08.469
Godspeed.

445
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.908
- Did he just say South America?

446
00:28:12.952 --> 00:28:15.606
- Oh my God.
- Not the south of America.

447
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.478
South of fucking America.

448
00:28:17.521 --> 00:28:19.175
- Oh my God. this is so crazy.

449
00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:21.395
Why did I even let you
convince me to look here?

450
00:28:23.832 --> 00:28:28.271
- Oh look. there's like
a paper or a script.

451
00:28:28.315 --> 00:28:29.359
- Please be a map.

452
00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:31.579
- A map?

453
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.627
It's a script with instructions.

454
00:28:36.671 --> 00:28:38.804
Instructions for
Save Love's handler.

455
00:28:38.847 --> 00:28:40.849
Participants will
wake up this oriented.

456
00:28:40.893 --> 00:28:42.982
read them the following message.

457
00:28:43.025 --> 00:28:46.246
Your name is insert name here.

458
00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:48.639
and I will be your handler
for Save Love's adventure.

459
00:28:48.683 --> 00:28:51.033
The purpose of this venture
is to give a last hurrah

460
00:28:51.077 --> 00:28:54.080
to the couples planning
to end their marriage.

461
00:28:54.123 --> 00:28:56.909
You should view this weekend
as an opportunity to say

462
00:28:56.952 --> 00:28:59.825
and do things that will leave
you both with no regrets

463
00:28:59.868 --> 00:29:01.827
as you embark on
your separate lives.

464
00:29:03.698 --> 00:29:07.615
On Monday. Monday at 8 a.m.
the adventure will end.

465
00:29:07.658 --> 00:29:10.574
and we will all be
picked up and taken home.

466
00:29:10.618 --> 00:29:13.752
In the meantime your
mission is to survive.

467
00:29:13.795 --> 00:29:16.232
Make the most of what you have.

468
00:29:16.276 --> 00:29:18.365
After that walk towards
a helicopter dramatically

469
00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:20.062
and climb in.

470
00:29:20.106 --> 00:29:21.629
The participants will
try to ask you questions

471
00:29:21.672 --> 00:29:23.805
act like you don't hear them.

472
00:29:23.849 --> 00:29:25.764
When you get into
the helicopter.

473
00:29:25.807 --> 00:29:29.071
yell back at them dramatically
with the following words.

474
00:29:29.115 --> 00:29:31.160
"Very important. if
at any point you want

475
00:29:31.204 --> 00:29:34.076
to quit this adventure
and forfeit your payment.

476
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.731
You can do this by lighting
the flare in your bag.

477
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:37.993
Only I will know what it means

478
00:29:38.037 --> 00:29:40.039
that I will come pick you up."

479
00:29:40.082 --> 00:29:41.910
Tell the pilot to hover
close to the ground.

480
00:29:41.954 --> 00:29:44.565
so that the participants
have to cover their faces

481
00:29:44.608 --> 00:29:47.133
then tell him to fly away fast.

482
00:29:47.176 --> 00:29:50.266
This will leave them
participants most impressed.

483
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.312
I am not impressed.

484
00:29:52.355 --> 00:29:56.055
- How to be an asshole to
people who just wasted 20Gs.

485
00:29:56.098 --> 00:29:57.970
- Oh my God. oh no. we
are definitely getting

486
00:29:58.013 --> 00:29:58.884
our money back.

487
00:29:58.927 --> 00:30:00.494
- [scoffs] Good luck with that.

488
00:30:00.537 --> 00:30:01.408
- What do you mean?

489
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:03.279
I didn't sign up for this.

490
00:30:03.323 --> 00:30:05.107
- Well.
- Well nothing.

491
00:30:05.151 --> 00:30:09.677
We just spent $20.000
on getting out of here.

492
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.855
so we can get divorce and this
is not what I signed up for.

493
00:30:13.899 --> 00:30:16.423
We have a hitman on the loose.

494
00:30:18.251 --> 00:30:20.470
and the guy that was supposed
to help us is now dead

495
00:30:20.514 --> 00:30:22.211
so we have no way to get
out of this nightmare.

496
00:30:22.255 --> 00:30:24.431
so best believe I am
getting my money back.

497
00:30:24.474 --> 00:30:26.215
and I am suing the
crap out of them.

498
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.523
- On Monday.
- Monday.

499
00:30:32.918 --> 00:30:33.832
- Today is Friday.

500
00:30:36.356 --> 00:30:40.926
We have to survive
in this until Monday.

501
00:30:48.063 --> 00:30:49.195
- What do you wanna do?

502
00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:52.851
- We can't stay here.

503
00:30:56.376 --> 00:30:59.074
so I'm looking this way and
all I'm seeing is nothing.

504
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.209
So we will definitely
run out of food and water

505
00:31:04.906 --> 00:31:06.081
before we hit civilization.

506
00:31:08.649 --> 00:31:11.043
If we go this way we
got the mountains.

507
00:31:11.086 --> 00:31:12.131
and that's a tough hike.

508
00:31:13.132 --> 00:31:15.438
but we'll have some shade.

509
00:31:16.613 --> 00:31:19.181
might find some water.

510
00:31:19.225 --> 00:31:23.446
and we'll definitely well
we might find a cave too.

511
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.752
- A cave?

512
00:31:24.795 --> 00:31:26.536
Do I look like a
cave woman to you?

513
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.581
- Do you have a better idea?

514
00:31:29.061 --> 00:31:32.455
- Oh God. just kill me now.

515
00:31:32.499 --> 00:31:33.717
- Don't tempt me.

516
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:34.370
- Don't start.

517
00:31:47.775 --> 00:31:50.256
[backpack zips]

518
00:31:53.259 --> 00:31:56.088
[sighs] What's the point?

519
00:31:56.131 --> 00:31:57.916
[sighs]

520
00:32:02.572 --> 00:32:04.139
- So the mountain then?

521
00:32:04.183 --> 00:32:05.140
- What choice do I have?

522
00:32:19.763 --> 00:32:22.331
[ambient music]

523
00:34:11.527 --> 00:34:12.876
- Good morning.

524
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.357
- Good morning.

525
00:34:17.925 --> 00:34:19.927
[sighs]

526
00:34:23.626 --> 00:34:24.975
I guess you're not so useless.

527
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:31.069
What are you making over there
with those astronaut meals?

528
00:34:31.112 --> 00:34:35.899
- We have Mexican chicken stew.

529
00:34:38.641 --> 00:34:39.773
beef ravioli.

530
00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:42.080
- Sounds delicious.

531
00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:46.301
[guitar music]

532
00:35:51.105 --> 00:35:53.281
It's actually pretty good.

533
00:36:04.118 --> 00:36:06.381
- What are we gonna tell Junior?

534
00:36:09.384 --> 00:36:10.124
- I don't know.

535
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:15.260
Honestly. why don't
we say we grew apart?

536
00:36:16.565 --> 00:36:17.697
- What does that even mean?

537
00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.179
- It's something
most couples say

538
00:36:21.222 --> 00:36:23.093
when they go through a divorce.

539
00:36:23.137 --> 00:36:24.269
It seems to fit us.

540
00:36:35.889 --> 00:36:36.585
- I wish we weren't.

541
00:36:42.461 --> 00:36:43.244
- Yeah me too.

542
00:36:48.554 --> 00:36:50.338
- [sighs] Well let's
hurry up and eat.

543
00:36:50.382 --> 00:36:52.471
'cause we need to get to
that cave before nightfall.

544
00:36:54.864 --> 00:36:57.040
I don't think I wanna
sleep on these rocks again.

545
00:37:01.784 --> 00:37:04.483
[suspense music]

546
00:37:24.459 --> 00:37:26.983
- Daryl. I can't
walk much further.

547
00:37:30.857 --> 00:37:35.209
- I figure we got
about 15 more minutes

548
00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:36.428
before we get to the peak.

549
00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:38.778
Can you tough it out?

550
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:42.695
- Well yeah. let me
just get some water.

551
00:37:51.573 --> 00:37:54.402
Daryl. I don't have
any more water.

552
00:37:56.578 --> 00:37:58.450
I thought I had
another bottle in here.

553
00:37:59.842 --> 00:38:01.366
Daryl I don't have
any more water.

554
00:38:03.411 --> 00:38:04.630
I think I drank less of it.
- Oh. I got one.

555
00:38:04.673 --> 00:38:05.587
I got one.

556
00:38:05.631 --> 00:38:06.196
It's okay.

557
00:38:09.548 --> 00:38:10.331
Thanks.

558
00:38:15.728 --> 00:38:19.558
You know. we've been
through way worse than this.

559
00:38:22.038 --> 00:38:27.740
Remember that time we got
robbed and stranded in Detroit.

560
00:38:27.783 --> 00:38:28.654
- [laughs] Yeah.

561
00:38:30.177 --> 00:38:32.135
No phone. no shoes. no money.

562
00:38:33.136 --> 00:38:34.312
- And nobody believed us.

563
00:38:36.183 --> 00:38:38.794
- Yeah. 'cause everybody
thought we were crackheads.

564
00:38:38.838 --> 00:38:40.318
- We did look and
smell like crackheads.

565
00:38:41.841 --> 00:38:44.060
- Well. you looked
like Samuel L. Jackson.

566
00:38:44.104 --> 00:38:45.366
I looked like Halle Berry.

567
00:38:46.585 --> 00:38:47.934
- All right "Jungle Fever" yeah.

568
00:38:53.505 --> 00:38:55.071
Anyway. we could
get through this.

569
00:38:58.771 --> 00:38:59.902
[Lola sighs]

570
00:38:59.946 --> 00:39:00.512
Right?

571
00:39:02.731 --> 00:39:03.471
- Yeah.

572
00:39:13.481 --> 00:39:15.309
- Let's go on our date.

573
00:39:21.533 --> 00:39:22.708
- Daryl?

574
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:23.317
- Yeah.

575
00:39:24.579 --> 00:39:26.538
- This is the worst
fucking date ever.

576
00:39:26.581 --> 00:39:30.455
- [laughs] Happy
Valentine's Day.

577
00:39:32.326 --> 00:39:33.283
- Happy Valentines.

578
00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:41.161
Oh my God.

579
00:39:42.292 --> 00:39:45.470
[groans] I'm so thirsty.

580
00:39:48.037 --> 00:39:49.430
I'm tired.

581
00:39:49.474 --> 00:39:52.433
- I'm tired. and
thirsty. and hungry.

582
00:39:52.477 --> 00:39:53.347
and I don't know which is worse.

583
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:57.743
- Is that what I think it is?

584
00:39:57.786 --> 00:40:02.487
- [chuckles] Yes. it's the top.

585
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.314
- How much further
do you think it is?

586
00:40:04.358 --> 00:40:07.753
- [groans] About three hours.

587
00:40:07.796 --> 00:40:09.232
- Oh no.

588
00:40:09.276 --> 00:40:11.887
- [sighs] I can't.
- Come on.

589
00:40:11.931 --> 00:40:13.062
- I can't take another step.

590
00:40:13.106 --> 00:40:14.412
- You need to.

591
00:40:14.455 --> 00:40:15.891
I don't plan to
die here with you.

592
00:40:19.939 --> 00:40:20.679
- I need to.

593
00:40:22.245 --> 00:40:26.293
- Actually look. I
think I found something.

594
00:40:26.336 --> 00:40:26.859
Come on.

595
00:40:28.382 --> 00:40:29.122
Come look.

596
00:40:32.995 --> 00:40:34.257
Come on. Daryl.

597
00:40:36.782 --> 00:40:37.522
Come on.

598
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:42.440
Look.

599
00:40:45.355 --> 00:40:47.662
Check. open it up.

600
00:40:47.706 --> 00:40:50.796
Well. be careful 'cause it
can be a bomb or something.

601
00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:51.405
- Really?

602
00:40:56.715 --> 00:40:58.238
- [Lola] What is it?

603
00:41:01.154 --> 00:41:02.242
- It's water.
- Oh my God.

604
00:41:02.285 --> 00:41:03.939
- And it's still cold.

605
00:41:03.983 --> 00:41:06.333
[Lola pants]

606
00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:10.685
How is it still cold?

607
00:41:10.729 --> 00:41:13.035
- I don't know zero fucks given.

608
00:41:14.384 --> 00:41:15.429
- Who do they belong to?

609
00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:17.300
- Really. it doesn't matter.

610
00:41:21.827 --> 00:41:23.655
- You know what?

611
00:41:23.698 --> 00:41:25.091
Let's package it up
and get outta here.

612
00:41:26.919 --> 00:41:28.660
- Not bad.

613
00:41:28.703 --> 00:41:30.966
- I don't wanna spend another
night on this mountain.

614
00:41:33.273 --> 00:41:35.144
- Yeah.

615
00:41:35.188 --> 00:41:37.364
- Matter of fact. did you
hear a howling last night?

616
00:41:37.407 --> 00:41:40.280
- Oh my God. did you
lick my toes last night?

617
00:41:40.323 --> 00:41:41.803
- Ah. in your dreams.

618
00:41:43.762 --> 00:41:45.764
- I mean. I'm serious.

619
00:41:45.807 --> 00:41:48.680
It was either you or
coyote sniffing around me

620
00:41:48.723 --> 00:41:49.768
and licking my toes.

621
00:41:51.857 --> 00:41:55.948
- Why would a coyote sniff
and lick us and not eat us?

622
00:41:55.991 --> 00:41:57.210
- Because we stink?

623
00:41:57.253 --> 00:41:58.516
- Speak for yourself.

624
00:41:58.559 --> 00:42:00.169
- You stink on a normal day.

625
00:42:00.213 --> 00:42:01.823
so I know you stink today.

626
00:42:01.867 --> 00:42:03.999
A matter of fact. it was
probably your stinking ass

627
00:42:04.043 --> 00:42:05.740
that saved us last night.

628
00:42:05.784 --> 00:42:09.657
- [laughs] You got jokes when
you get a little water in you.

629
00:42:09.701 --> 00:42:11.267
- I'm just saying.

630
00:42:11.311 --> 00:42:13.487
It could be one or two options.

631
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:16.446
either coyote lick
my toes or you did.

632
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:17.578
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

633
00:42:28.284 --> 00:42:32.724
Wait a minute. what
if this was all a part

634
00:42:33.812 --> 00:42:36.118
of Save Love's Adventure?

635
00:42:36.162 --> 00:42:39.557
You know. like. when
the marathon organizers

636
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.036
they leave refreshments
along the route.

637
00:42:42.777 --> 00:42:46.172
- Okay. but how could
they possibly know

638
00:42:46.215 --> 00:42:47.652
that we will end up
in this exact spot.

639
00:42:49.697 --> 00:42:51.656
- I mean. that is true.

640
00:42:51.699 --> 00:42:53.788
our tour guide Bobby
did get murdered.

641
00:42:55.094 --> 00:42:59.664
- Unless Bobby's
job was to drop us

642
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.492
in the middle of nowhere.

643
00:43:02.536 --> 00:43:05.017
and let us fend for ourselves.

644
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.846
and remember we did all those
personality assessments.

645
00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:11.980
So maybe they just calculated

646
00:43:12.024 --> 00:43:15.114
what logical decisions we
will make all the way up

647
00:43:15.157 --> 00:43:15.723
until this point.

648
00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:21.642
- Right. but they
probably figured

649
00:43:23.383 --> 00:43:25.167
that we would see the city

650
00:43:25.211 --> 00:43:28.127
from the top of the mountain's
peak and then just give up.

651
00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:31.913
- Exactly. 'cause remember even
when we were on the mountain

652
00:43:31.957 --> 00:43:33.785
when we first started
climbing the mountain

653
00:43:33.828 --> 00:43:37.789
the only route that we
could logically took

654
00:43:37.832 --> 00:43:40.487
without mission impossible
style mountain climbing

655
00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:42.402
there was only one.

656
00:43:42.445 --> 00:43:48.451
So in theory. if we make
logical decisions the whole way

657
00:43:48.495 --> 00:43:51.019
through it shouldn't
lead us to safety.

658
00:43:51.063 --> 00:43:54.980
or at least help us
survive until Monday.

659
00:43:55.023 --> 00:43:57.373
- Okay. but what
happens when your logic

660
00:43:57.417 --> 00:43:59.419
and my logic are not the same?

661
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.730
- Shit. I don't know.

662
00:44:07.514 --> 00:44:09.037
- [sighs] We'll
just talk it out.

663
00:44:09.081 --> 00:44:10.691
like we did in the desert.

664
00:44:10.735 --> 00:44:12.475
Pack up the waters in your
backpack and let's go.

665
00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:18.133
- It's okay.

666
00:44:18.177 --> 00:44:20.788
[backpack unzips]

667
00:44:20.832 --> 00:44:21.833
- [Lola] Make sure you
get all of those. Daryl.

668
00:44:21.876 --> 00:44:22.660
- Yeah. yeah.

669
00:44:23.748 --> 00:44:27.186
[backpack zips]

670
00:44:27.229 --> 00:44:27.795
- Hurry up.

671
00:44:41.896 --> 00:44:44.551
[suspense music]

672
00:44:49.034 --> 00:44:51.819
[car engine revving]

673
00:44:54.126 --> 00:44:55.823
This is some kind of a mirage.

674
00:44:55.867 --> 00:44:57.651
- [Miguel] Hello amigos.

675
00:44:59.218 --> 00:45:00.001
Americano.

676
00:45:01.568 --> 00:45:02.569
- Oh my God.

677
00:45:04.353 --> 00:45:05.485
American?

678
00:45:05.528 --> 00:45:06.399
You is Americano.

679
00:45:06.442 --> 00:45:08.053
- Do you understand English?

680
00:45:08.096 --> 00:45:09.315
[Miguel speaks in
foreign language]

681
00:45:09.358 --> 00:45:11.099
- I mean obviously that
person is a Mexican.

682
00:45:11.143 --> 00:45:13.623
- [speaks in foreign language]
You're two Americano. right?

683
00:45:13.667 --> 00:45:14.929
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

684
00:45:14.973 --> 00:45:18.628
[Miguel yells in
foreign language]

685
00:45:20.326 --> 00:45:21.893
- This is the part where his
friends harvest our kidneys.

686
00:45:21.936 --> 00:45:23.633
- [Miguel speaks in
foreign language] Okay?

687
00:45:23.677 --> 00:45:26.941
[Miguel Speaks in
foreign language]

688
00:45:26.985 --> 00:45:30.205
My sister she make a bet
from moneys and chips.

689
00:45:30.249 --> 00:45:31.816
do not touch.

690
00:45:31.859 --> 00:45:34.557
[speaks in foreign language]
She says you guys are Africans.

691
00:45:34.601 --> 00:45:37.430
and I said [speaks in
foreign language]. come on.

692
00:45:37.473 --> 00:45:38.387
See that the problem is.

693
00:45:39.954 --> 00:45:41.651
I watch a little
bit of MTV. okay.

694
00:45:41.695 --> 00:45:45.351
so that's why when I see
swag I know what it is.

695
00:45:45.394 --> 00:45:49.137
Baby. but when I look at you
the scheme. J Lo. baby good.

696
00:45:49.181 --> 00:45:51.661
And you my friend [speaks in
foreign language] those Timbs.

697
00:45:51.705 --> 00:45:52.924
Brooklyn. baby. Brooklyn.
[speaks in foreign language].

698
00:45:56.797 --> 00:45:59.713
You're good. okay man.

699
00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:05.501
Let me get something. you
rapping and you hoochie mama.

700
00:46:05.545 --> 00:46:07.460
- Hoochie mama. no.

701
00:46:07.503 --> 00:46:09.505
- Oh. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry.

702
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:12.987
okay. my English not
very good looking.

703
00:46:13.031 --> 00:46:16.904
I meant to say a baby mama.

704
00:46:16.948 --> 00:46:20.473
- Oh. no. I'm definitely
not a baby mama.

705
00:46:20.516 --> 00:46:22.997
- Technically. you are.

00:55:39.684 --> 00:55:43.557
about something shitty
that you did to me

881
00:55:46.691 --> 00:55:49.476
I think of something equally
shitty that I did to you.

882
00:55:51.696 --> 00:55:55.526
and then I remember something
shitty that you did to me

883
00:55:55.569 --> 00:55:57.136
before I did a
shitty thing to you.

884
00:55:57.179 --> 00:56:01.314
and I guess. I just don't
know where it all started.

885
00:56:03.882 --> 00:56:08.582
- I mean. I understand we've
been together for seven years.

886
00:56:10.845 --> 00:56:15.110
and I honestly can't remember
the last time I liked you.

887
00:56:15.154 --> 00:56:17.504
- I mean--
- Damn.

888
00:56:17.548 --> 00:56:21.465
- Don't get me wrong.
I love you I just

889
00:56:23.945 --> 00:56:26.470
I can't remember the last time
that I was in love with you.

890
00:56:28.776 --> 00:56:31.039
I mean sometimes you're
so ugly to each other

891
00:56:31.083 --> 00:56:35.566
that you get to a point
that there's just no return.

892
00:56:40.135 --> 00:56:40.962
- Yeah.

893
00:56:44.313 --> 00:56:46.315
[sighs]

894
00:56:49.362 --> 00:56:50.537
you know what?

895
00:56:52.887 --> 00:56:54.149
We're here now.

896
00:56:55.803 --> 00:57:00.460
like for whatever crazy force
of nature brought us here.

897
00:57:03.071 --> 00:57:03.550
we're here now.

898
00:57:05.944 --> 00:57:11.384
so maybe we should just
do what Dr. Barrabi said.

899
00:57:11.428 --> 00:57:11.602
It's a date.

900
00:57:14.953 --> 00:57:15.780
Let's try to enjoy it.

901
00:57:20.088 --> 00:57:20.872
- Okay.

902
00:57:22.656 --> 00:57:23.396
Deal?

903
00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:26.834
- Deal.

904
00:57:29.141 --> 00:57:32.405
- But what are we gonna
do tomorrow night?

905
00:57:32.449 --> 00:57:34.538
I don't wanna stay outside
and be homeless again.

906
00:57:39.804 --> 00:57:44.373
- Usually people think
better well rested.

907
00:57:47.594 --> 00:57:49.988
Let's get some rest
then we'll figure it out

908
00:57:50.031 --> 00:57:50.771
when we wake up.

909
00:57:53.861 --> 00:57:55.036
- Okay.

910
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.735
[ominous music]

911
00:58:10.965 --> 00:58:13.490
[bangs on door]

912
00:58:16.449 --> 00:58:17.232
Coming.

913
00:58:38.036 --> 00:58:40.125
- Where'd that come from?

914
00:58:40.168 --> 00:58:41.692
- Who knows left outside.

915
00:58:43.302 --> 00:58:45.522
I mean. obviously
it was a mistake.

916
00:58:45.565 --> 00:58:47.132
Let me go give it
to the front desk.

917
00:58:47.175 --> 00:58:47.828
- Oh. not so fast.

918
00:58:50.004 --> 00:58:53.921
I'm saying maybe
there's something in
there we could sell.

919
00:58:53.965 --> 00:58:56.620
- Oh my God. you are so grimy.

920
00:58:56.663 --> 00:59:00.145
- Babe. I'm saying
if we don't come up

921
00:59:00.188 --> 00:59:02.277
with a plan we're gonna
be sleeping on the streets

922
00:59:02.321 --> 00:59:03.670
in Nophono today.

923
00:59:05.716 --> 00:59:07.761
I think we at least
owe it to ourselves

924
00:59:07.805 --> 00:59:09.241
to know what's in the bag.

925
00:59:11.983 --> 00:59:16.161
- Wait. what if this is all
part of Save Love's experience?

926
00:59:19.773 --> 00:59:21.862
- Miguel is so fucking weird.

927
00:59:21.906 --> 00:59:23.385
[Lola chuckles]

928
00:59:23.429 --> 00:59:24.996
and no phone. no internet.

929
00:59:27.259 --> 00:59:30.958
- I mean. what are the odds
that his cousin owns a hotel?

930
00:59:34.266 --> 00:59:34.875
- I see your point.

931
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:39.837
What if what you're
saying is true

932
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:46.017
then doing the most logical
thing should lead us

933
00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:46.670
to what we need.

934
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:52.850
- Fuck it. open the bag.

935
00:59:54.242 --> 00:59:58.595
- Wait. what if there's a bomb?

936
00:59:58.638 --> 00:59:59.508
- Now it's a bomb.

937
01:00:00.509 --> 01:00:01.946
- I'm serious.

938
01:00:01.989 --> 01:00:04.296
- Oh my God. you watch
too much action movies.

939
01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:04.688
Open the bag.

940
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:07.604
Open it.

941
01:00:09.257 --> 01:00:10.607
- And if it is a bomb?

942
01:00:12.478 --> 01:00:15.002
- If it's a bomb we can sell it

943
01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:17.265
so we don't have to spend
another night outside.

944
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.875
Open the bag.

945
01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:26.884
[Lola gasps]

946
01:00:26.927 --> 01:00:29.451
- It'll feel like
$5 million in here.

947
01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:35.414
- What are we gonna do?

948
01:00:35.457 --> 01:00:37.764
- Well. I'll tell you
what we're not gonna do.

949
01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:40.201
we not turning it
into the front desk.

950
01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:46.904
Let's pack this shit up
and go get us some food.

951
01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:49.036
and pay for another
night at the hotel.

952
01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:49.820
- Aint gotta tell me twice.

953
01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:50.429
Let's go.

954
01:00:58.567 --> 01:01:00.134
Hurry up.

955
01:01:00.178 --> 01:01:00.744
Let's go.

956
01:01:04.878 --> 01:01:05.879
Waiting on you slow poke.

957
01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:08.142
- Almost done.

958
01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:11.493
- Wait a minute.

959
01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.236
Back there you call me
babe that's how we feeling?

960
01:01:19.284 --> 01:01:23.592
- [sighs] We're in
a truce right now.

961
01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.121
Truce till we
survive this thing.

962
01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:32.906
- I'm tired of arguing.

963
01:01:33.994 --> 01:01:34.691
Truce.

964
01:01:38.216 --> 01:01:40.740

[guitar music]

966
01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:05.460
We did that.

967
01:02:05.504 --> 01:02:06.070
- Oh yeah.

968
01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:12.598
Do you know what we didn't do?

969
01:02:12.641 --> 01:02:14.339
- What?
- We didn't shower.

970
01:02:23.391 --> 01:02:25.742
[piano music]

971
01:02:33.706 --> 01:02:34.489
- Damn.

972
01:02:36.927 --> 01:02:38.537
- You coming?

973
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:41.453
[piano music continues]

[upbeat music]

976
01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.427
What was that?
- Somebody is pissed.

977
01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:31.432
- Open the door.
- Or what?

978
01:04:31.476 --> 01:04:33.957
- You missed the drop.

979
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.697
- My boss--
- Your job was to wait

980
01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:37.177
until I get the money.

981
01:04:37.221 --> 01:04:39.440
It wasn't dropped
off to me. all right.

982
01:04:39.484 --> 01:04:42.400
so I'm sorting it out
now. but I need more time.

983
01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:44.924
- [Man] You have
approximately three seconds.

984
01:04:44.968 --> 01:04:45.664
one. three.

985
01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:48.797
[gun fires]

986
01:04:50.538 --> 01:04:51.017
- Oh shit.

987
01:04:52.453 --> 01:04:54.151
Someone's got to report
this to the cops.

988
01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:55.543
- We gotta get out of here.

989
01:04:55.587 --> 01:04:56.718
We cannot stay here.

990
01:04:56.762 --> 01:04:57.937
Let's go. let's go.

991
01:04:57.981 --> 01:04:59.243
- Let's get the fuck outta here.

992
01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:01.419
- Let's go. let's go.
- Wait. wait. wait. wait.

993
01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:02.115
We can't leave.

994
01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:04.901
We gotta calm down.

995
01:05:06.815 --> 01:05:08.078
They don't know we here.

996
01:05:09.253 --> 01:05:12.386
- Someone just got murdered.

997
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:16.477
- I know but if we
leave they will see us.

998
01:05:16.521 --> 01:05:19.567
Look. the way I see it
the best thing to do is

999
01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:20.786
to stay in the room.

1000
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:22.527
We order room service

1001
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:24.137
and we don't fucking leave
until Monday morning.

1002
01:05:24.181 --> 01:05:27.184
- No. I'm getting the
fuck outta here now.

1003
01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:31.101
- Listen. to me we only got two
options. either we stay here

1004
01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:34.452
or we go and sleep
in the mountains.

1005
01:05:34.495 --> 01:05:35.888
or we can't sleep in the streets

1006
01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.281
'cause we're too conspicuous.
- No. no. no. no.

1007
01:05:37.324 --> 01:05:40.110
I'm not sleeping in the
mountains one more night.

1008
01:05:40.153 --> 01:05:41.067
- Then it's settled.

1009

- Oh God.

1010
01:05:44.592 --> 01:05:45.419
I'm scared.

I'm sorry.

- For what?

1016
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:24.241
- For cheating on you.

[Suspense music]

1018
01:06:40.344 --> 01:06:41.084
- That's it.

1019
01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:43.608
You're not gonna say anything?

1020
01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:44.609
- I cheated on you too.

1021
01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:46.393
- What?

1022
01:06:49.831 --> 01:06:54.923
Hold up you have been
treating me like shit lately

1023
01:06:54.967 --> 01:06:56.012
and you cheated on me too.

1024
01:06:57.448 --> 01:06:59.102
Daryl you got me fucked up.

1025
01:06:59.145 --> 01:06:59.711
- [Daryl] Sorry.

1026
01:07:01.321 --> 01:07:03.628
- Who did you cheat on with?

1027
01:07:03.671 --> 01:07:07.936
No. matter of fact I can't
even believe you right now.

1028
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.329
Seriously. after everything.

1029
01:07:11.157 --> 01:07:13.290
You've been walking
around here treating me

1030
01:07:13.333 --> 01:07:15.118
like I'm some sort
of damaged goods.

1031
01:07:18.686 --> 01:07:20.123
- [Daryl] Okay. you wanna know?

1032
01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:21.776
- Why Daryl. tell me
why. tell me why Daryl?

1033
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.822
- I'll tell you. I
will tell you why.

1034
01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:25.519
Because...

1035
01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:30.916
I can't make it even. okay.

1036
01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.922
I slept with that
girl out of spite.

1037
01:07:38.489 --> 01:07:39.490
With an empty heart.

1038
01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:45.974
I couldn't even even enjoy it.

1039

'cause I kept seeing
your face with him.

1040
01:08:00.337 --> 01:08:03.905
You used to be my
only obsession.

1041
01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:09.520
but you killed that.

1042
01:08:17.919 --> 01:08:20.922
- Daryl. [sighs] look.

1043
01:08:31.585 --> 01:08:33.109
I know I fucked up. okay.

1044
01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.158
and you fucked up.
we both fucked up.

1045
01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:41.552
[ominous music]

1046
01:08:43.467 --> 01:08:47.732
but it's not fair for you
to treat me like shit.

1047
01:08:49.255 --> 01:08:51.953
because of one single
moment. one mistake.

1048
01:08:51.997 --> 01:08:53.651
and I'm gonna own that.

1049
01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:56.654
that is my truth that I
cheated on and I'm sorry.

1050
01:08:56.697 --> 01:08:57.829
I am so sorry.

1051
01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:05.097
but for you to sit there and
act like all the good things

1052
01:09:06.403 --> 01:09:08.666
that I do means nothing.

1054
01:09:21.113 --> 01:09:25.857

1055
01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.294
to promise me one thing. Daryl

1056

when it comes to our son.

1057
01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:35.693
that you're always
gonna be there for him.

1058
01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.872
That you are gonna be the
kind of father that he needs

1059
01:09:40.915 --> 01:09:43.004
to steer the boat even
when the waters are rough.

1060
01:09:45.659 --> 01:09:48.880
because he needs
you above anybody.

1061
01:09:54.364 --> 01:09:58.846
Look. in the divorce
I don't want anything.

1062
01:10:00.805 --> 01:10:02.328
I don't want your money.

1063
01:10:03.895 --> 01:10:05.766
I don't want child
support. no alimony.

1064
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:10.293
I just I want us to be
friends like we used to be.

1065
01:10:13.121 --> 01:10:14.166
- I'm being petty as fuck.

1066
01:10:15.036 --> 01:10:17.561
[both laughing]

1067
01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:23.393
- Oh my God. you
are being petty.

1068
01:10:23.436 --> 01:10:25.786
[both laughing]

1069
01:10:30.878 --> 01:10:31.662
- I forgive you. Lola.

1070
01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:39.409
Let's just never talk
about this again.

1071
01:10:41.019 --> 01:10:45.284
and let's never fight in
front of our child again.

1072
01:10:50.158 --> 01:10:50.942
- Agreed.

1073
01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:57.688
I'm sorry.

1074
01:10:57.731 --> 01:10:58.863
- Yeah. me too.

1075
01:11:28.806 --> 01:11:32.462
- Oh Daryl. get
up. get up. get up.

1076
01:11:36.683 --> 01:11:38.816
[Machete shushes]

1077
01:11:38.859 --> 01:11:43.560
- [speaks in foreign
language] First things first.

1078
01:11:45.953 --> 01:11:48.129
if you scream you die.

1079
01:11:58.139 --> 01:12:01.012
Good morning to the happy soon

1080
01:12:01.055 --> 01:12:01.665
to be divorced couple.

1081
01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:09.542
Don't be mean say
good morning back.

1082
01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.199
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1083
01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:24.035
- In my culture it's very
rude to start a conversation

1084
01:12:24.078 --> 01:12:25.036
before brushing your teeth.

1085
01:12:25.906 --> 01:12:26.864
so please...

1086
01:12:34.045 --> 01:12:35.699
go brush your teeth.

1087
01:12:35.742 --> 01:12:38.528
so we can have a
polite conversation.

1088
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:56.633
That's enough get
back over here.

1089
01:12:57.982 --> 01:12:58.417
Sit on the bed.

1090
01:13:07.078 --> 01:13:11.256
My name is Alfonso
Mundo Matamoros Doohan

1091
01:13:11.299 --> 01:13:13.519
Ramon Nunez Pinyon. Jr.

1092
01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:20.091
but my friends. and my
enemies know me as Machete.

1093
01:13:22.528 --> 01:13:27.185
You have the option to
be a friend or an enemy.

1094
01:13:30.014 --> 01:13:32.059
either way you will call me?

1095
01:13:37.151 --> 01:13:38.588
- Machete.
- Machete.

1096
01:13:38.631 --> 01:13:40.633
- Very good. very good.

1097
01:13:41.721 --> 01:13:42.505
You're a smart couple.

1098
01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:46.509
I know you grew up poor.

1099
01:13:48.902 --> 01:13:52.210
but now you are more educated

1100
01:13:52.253 --> 01:13:54.299
than most of the US population.

1101
01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.520
You have a suburban lifestyle.

1102
01:13:58.608 --> 01:13:59.870
You have an honorable kid.

1103
01:14:01.959 --> 01:14:03.613
You pretty much
have a perfect life.

1104
01:14:06.354 --> 01:14:07.660
Let me tell you about myself.

1105
01:14:09.009 --> 01:14:10.054
I too. have a family.

1106
01:14:11.925 --> 01:14:14.145
I have a beautiful young
daughter. a fantastic wife.

1107
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.978
I work for the person who that
money was supposed to go to.

1108
01:14:23.371 --> 01:14:26.505
You see right now we should be
in the middle of this thing.

1109
01:14:28.638 --> 01:14:31.945
The man next door he's
an Interpol agent.

1110
01:14:34.078 --> 01:14:38.386
He was supposed to make a
transaction with my boss.

1111
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:42.565
and he was supposed to record
it and provide it to Interpol

1112
01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:45.089
so they can arrest my boss.

1113
01:14:45.132 --> 01:14:51.138
and in exchange me and my
family we're supposed to move

1114
01:14:51.182 --> 01:14:52.488
to a new country and
start a new life.

1115
01:14:54.577 --> 01:14:57.188
But somebody bust the
drop and you guys wind up

1116
01:14:57.231 --> 01:14:57.797
with the money.

1117
01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:01.497
[sighs] Let me ask you this.

1118
01:15:03.455 --> 01:15:04.630
and do not lie to me.

1119
01:15:05.849 --> 01:15:07.677
did you spend any of that money?

1120
01:15:11.898 --> 01:15:12.682
- Yes.

1121
01:15:14.248 --> 01:15:17.077
[Machete sighs]

1122
01:15:17.121 --> 01:15:20.037
[Machete screams]

1123
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.300
[gun fires]

1124
01:15:24.432 --> 01:15:26.260
Okay. [sighs]

1125
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:33.267
But anyway. my boss is pissed.

1126
01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:39.752
but I'm sure I can explain it
away as a misunderstanding.

1127
01:15:39.796 --> 01:15:43.190
and we can make this
deal happen again.

1128
01:15:46.063 --> 01:15:48.761
because after all we got
the Interpol agent killed.

1129
01:15:50.067 --> 01:15:54.680
You will impersonate the
agent and his mistress.

1130
01:15:58.249 --> 01:16:00.817
You will record the
interaction on this webcam.

1131
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:04.821
get the video to Interpol.

1132
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:10.740
and then you can go home
and I can start a new life.

1133
01:16:10.783 --> 01:16:12.306
- Look man. we're really sorry.

1134
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:13.220
- We're not the type.

1135
01:16:13.264 --> 01:16:15.832
- but we're not that. just not.

1136
01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:17.747
I'm a lover. not a fighter.
- And I'm an accountant.

1137
01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:21.664
- Both of you will do
this. you understand?

1138
01:16:27.452 --> 01:16:29.497
Or I just kill you now.

1139
01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:31.543
- We'll do it.
- We'll do it.

1140
01:16:36.026 --> 01:16:38.898
- Daryl. you're supposed
to be a high town criminal

1141
01:16:38.942 --> 01:16:40.247
who moves from place to place.

1142
01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:42.728
so the authorities
can't find him.

1143
01:16:42.772 --> 01:16:44.425
Lola. you're a prostitute

1144
01:16:44.469 --> 01:16:47.167
that Daryl has
rented indefinitely.

1145
01:16:47.211 --> 01:16:49.822
Both of you have to look like
you come from the underworld.

1146
01:16:49.866 --> 01:16:50.997
if you want my boss
to believe you.

1147
01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:58.048
I serve as head of security.

1148
01:16:58.091 --> 01:16:59.571
so I will be the
one standing next

1149
01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:01.529
to my boss receiving the money.

1150
01:17:01.573 --> 01:17:04.489
and counting it so the
money won't be missed.

1151
01:17:04.532 --> 01:17:08.232
Be at this address with a
briefcase at 12 o'clock.

1152
01:17:08.275 --> 01:17:10.277
high noon. do you understand?

1153
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:14.891
[upbeat music]

1154
01:17:32.212 --> 01:17:35.781
- All right. we
got like one minute

1155
01:17:35.825 --> 01:17:37.609
before we're supposed
to be in there.

1156
01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:40.438
and I can't fucking breathe.
- Just breathe. Daryl.

1157
01:17:40.481 --> 01:17:41.047
Oh my God.

1158
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:45.095
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1159
01:17:45.138 --> 01:17:45.704
No.

1160
01:17:46.836 --> 01:17:49.752
- Not this shit again.
- Okay.

1161
01:17:49.795 --> 01:17:53.581
Focus. focus. focus.
- Okay.

1162
01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:55.758
- Breathe. take a deep breath.

1163
01:17:57.107 --> 01:17:57.934
Let it out.

1164
01:17:59.152 --> 01:18:00.719
Okay.

1165
01:18:00.763 --> 01:18:04.114
I need you to be
the guy that you are

1166
01:18:04.157 --> 01:18:06.507
whenever we're at the bar and
someone is looking at my ass.

1167
01:18:06.551 --> 01:18:09.597
That guy. I need
you to be him. okay?

1168
01:18:09.641 --> 01:18:11.077
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1169
01:18:11.121 --> 01:18:12.078
You feel it?

1170
01:18:12.122 --> 01:18:13.253
Do you feel it?
- Yeah.

1171
01:18:13.297 --> 01:18:16.517
Shit yeah.
- Yeah. okay. okay.

1172

- I got this.
- Yes.

1173

is paid up. right?

1174
01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:23.742
- Yeah. three months in advance.

1175
01:18:23.786 --> 01:18:24.874
- Good. good. good. good.

1176
01:18:28.486 --> 01:18:29.400
I need to tell you something.
- I need

1177
01:18:29.443 --> 01:18:30.401
to tell you something.

1178
01:18:30.444 --> 01:18:31.663
- Okay. you go.
- Okay. you go.

1179
01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:32.838
- Go first. go first.
- Okay.

1180
01:18:35.275 --> 01:18:36.407
If we don't make it
outta here alive--

1181
01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:37.364
- Don't say that.

1182
01:18:37.408 --> 01:18:39.062
- We gotta have a plan.

1183
01:18:39.105 --> 01:18:40.367
- Okay. what?

1184
01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:40.759
- If we don't make
it outta here alive

1185
01:18:42.369 --> 01:18:45.111
we gotta tell Junior
something heroic.

1186
01:18:45.155 --> 01:18:47.418
We can't let him think
we died doing some kind

1187
01:18:47.461 --> 01:18:49.289
of freaky drug deal.

1188
01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:50.421
- Okay. that'll work.

1189
01:18:53.076 --> 01:18:54.338
- All right. cool.
- Let's go.

1190
01:18:54.381 --> 01:18:55.121

- Yeah.

- Wait. what did
you want to tell me?

1193
01:18:57.210 --> 01:18:59.735
- Oh. nothing.

01:18:59.778 --> 01:19:01.084
Let's go. let's go.

- You might not
get another chance.

- Good idea.
- Okay.

1198
01:19:07.525 --> 01:19:08.091
- All right.

01:19:11.007 --> 01:19:11.790
- Daryl?

1200
01:19:23.367 --> 01:19:24.324
Let's do it.

1201
01:19:25.848 --> 01:19:26.892
Put your glasses on.

1202
01:19:26.936 --> 01:19:27.501
- Okay.

1203
01:19:29.329 --> 01:19:30.113
All right.

- I have the burn.
I've got the burn.

- Well. well. well. so you
finally decided to show up

01:20:13.678 --> 01:20:14.244
with my money.

1209
01:20:17.377 --> 01:20:19.945
- We'd some problems
with the drop.

1210
01:20:19.989 --> 01:20:21.077
but we here now.

1211
01:20:22.643 --> 01:20:24.123
- Do you have the money?

[suspense music]

1213
01:20:36.614 --> 01:20:37.571
- It's all here boss.

- Pleasure doing
business with you.

1215
01:20:44.578 --> 01:20:47.103
- Wait a minute. what
about our product?

1216
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:53.500
- I see who wears the
pants in this relationship.

1217
01:20:56.199 --> 01:20:59.376
Your product will be delivered

1218
01:20:59.419 --> 01:21:01.857
whenever you pay the full
value of my services.

1219

- Look. you don't know
who you messing with.

1220
01:21:12.389 --> 01:21:16.697
We brought you the money
now you give us our product.

1221
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:19.744
or else shit.

1222
01:21:21.702 --> 01:21:24.662
- I've always considered
banks a rip off.

1223
01:21:24.705 --> 01:21:28.274
Yet. they are a
necessary rip off.

1224
01:21:29.841 --> 01:21:34.933
I mean. where else
can you get a service

1225
01:21:34.977 --> 01:21:39.416
that is guaranteed against
any extenuating circumstance.

1226
01:21:41.679 --> 01:21:46.336
In banking. late payments
cost you interest.

1227
01:21:48.077 --> 01:21:50.644
It's fundamentally
there after all.

You two came highly recommended
by my head of security.

1229

Now I've taken your
integrity for granted.

1230
01:22:02.091 --> 01:22:06.922
so can you imagine how
disappointed I would be

1231
01:22:09.185 --> 01:22:14.103
if you decided not
to treat me fairly

1232
01:22:16.496 --> 01:22:19.195
by not paying me the
interest you owe me.

1233
01:22:21.023 --> 01:22:21.806
- How much?

1234
01:22:23.329 --> 01:22:24.113
- Double.

1235
01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:31.990
The higher the stakes
the higher the interest.

1236
01:22:33.818 --> 01:22:34.601

1238
01:22:45.047 --> 01:22:48.050
- My head of security believes

1239
01:22:48.093 --> 01:22:50.095
I should show you the products

1240
01:22:50.139 --> 01:22:53.969
so that you would be
sufficiently motivated
to get my money.

1241
01:22:56.145 --> 01:22:58.538

West African blood diamonds.

But I don't think you are
sufficiently motivated.

1244
01:23:22.606 --> 01:23:24.738

little show for you.

1245

here should know better

1246

than to ever question my
authority in front of my men.

1247

now going to cut off his hand.

not have to do that.
