00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.600
Hey Honey.

4
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.800
Hi Mum.

5
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.200
Just wanted to let you know I am on my way home.

6
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.700
I’m in the taxi now so shouldn't be much longer.

7
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.300
Have you left the spare key for me?

8
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.350
Yes. under the far right flower pot.

9
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.200
Ok thank you. How are you and Dad doing?

10
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.700
Have you sorted flights back yet?

11
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.100
Not yet. The Hotel is closing tomorrow so we're going

12
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.650
to the embassy today to see what they can do about it.

13
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.300
The airlines have been bloody useless.

14
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.700
But I'll text you. Should only be a matter of time.

15
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.400
Ok.

16
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.100
Are you all sorted though?

17
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.000
Yeah Absolutely.

18
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.700
University have set some online lectures

19
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.450
and I've got some dissertation stuff to get on with so

20
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.400
I'll just be studying from home this week.

21
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.600
But they don't know how long this will go on for.

22
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.500
They've said three weeks but could be longer.

23
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.100
It'll all blow over eventually. Just keep yourself inside until

24
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.180
we get back. Save yourself collecting a fine or anything.

25
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.450
Yeah. Yeah will do.

26
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.900
Are you and Dad alright though?

27
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.000
I mean you haven't got any symptoms or anything?

28
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.600
No no. We've just been tested and we're fine.

29
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.100
It's why the consulate are in a rush to get people like us home.

30
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.300
Well. at least those safe enough to travel.

31
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.600
Right. No. that makes sense.

32
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.300
I just feel bad for the airline staff.

33
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.400
I mean. what a time to be in that industry.

34
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.200
It could be worse. I've been put under this furlough scheme.

35
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.500
Lucky me. but anyway.

36
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.700
If you need anything just let us know. Ok?

37
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.400
No that's fine. Um right. I'll talk to you later then.

38
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.900
Alright Honey. Stay safe. I love you. Take care.

39
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.400
Yeah alright. Love you. Bye.

40
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.200
Bye. Bye.

41
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.000
Cheers.

42
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.300
No signal. Yep. Haven't missed that.

43
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.800
Hello room.

44
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.700
Many people living in isolated areas will have to request

45
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.300
a visit from social workers who will provide remote testing

46
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.200
for those in the at risk category and are unable to visit a testing centre.

47
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.700
However. the home office warns that these won't be available for some time.

48
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
With the toll of the disease rapidly increasing to the level of

49
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.800
the influenza virus. the World Health Organisation is demanding world leaders

50
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.300
to take the threat more seriously and say more decisive action is needed.

51
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.500
Latest figures show that over three thousand new cases are being

52
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.600
reported daily with more than 700 deaths worldwide.

53
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.800
(Guitar Video)... and C major and G major.

54
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.500
(Online Class)...to illustrate the narrator's insanity.

55
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Good morning. I'm here from the local authorities about the current situation.

56
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.800
I’ve got a Mr and Mrs Brookes registered here.

57
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.800
Um. No sorry. They're abroad at the moment.

58
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.750
I'm their son.

59
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.250
Oh I see travel issues.

60
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.400
Yeah. Something like that.

61
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.400
Well because they're in the most at risk group it's my job to come

62
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.800
to check on certain residents in isolated areas.

63
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:15.500
Okay.

64
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.500
So we're just making inquiries.

65
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.500
Yeah yeah.

66
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.700
Are you living here on your own?

67
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.800
Yeah yeah just me at the moment.

68
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.400
Ok well can I come inside? I've got a few bits here to help you with self isolating.

69
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.100
Sure of course. Come on in.

70
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.400
Can I get you a cup of tea or something?

71
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I don't think that's the best thing to do given the current situation.

72
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.500
But don't worry won't be long.

73
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.800
Yeah yeah.

74
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.750
So how long have you been self isolating for?

75
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.700
About two weeks.

76
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.000
Ok and it's just you living here?

77
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.200
Just me.

78
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.100
Are you fully stocked for food?

79
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.800
Yeah. Yeah yeah. Should be- (coughs)

80
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.750
Sorry.

81
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.400
I've got a few delivery slots. Do you have any idea how long this will go for?

82
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.000
Your guess is as good as ours.

83
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.800
Look. are you suffering from any symptoms?

84
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.200
No no I don't think so.

85
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.650
Okay. Well I've got a test kit here actually so if you like we

86
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.600
can do a sample and just text you when the results are in.

87
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.100
Sure yeah.

88
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.750
I didn't notice a car in your driveway. so I take it you don't drive?

89
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:42.600
No.

90
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.700
Alright. Well if there is an emergency. foodwise or healthwise or anything

91
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.200
you can consult that leaflet for government support.

92
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.500
Oh great.

93
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.800
And I better take that swab.

94
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.400
Yes.

95
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.500
So we'll call round again when your parents are home.

96
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.650
If you can pass the information on to them.

97
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.700
And if you've got any concerns you can check the pamphlet

98
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.200
and there's a help number on there.

99
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.200
Brilliant. Okay.

100
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.200
Yeah? Alright okay. Bye.

101
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.700
Bye. Thanks. See you later.

102
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
RINGTONE - Beethoven's 5th Symphony.

103
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.500
Hello.

104
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.000
Hey. That was quick.

105
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.100
Yeah. Yeah I wasn't doing much.

106
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.900
How have you been?

107
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.100
How is lockdown treating you?

108
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.300
Yeah not bad. Um.

109
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.250
Parents still aren't home. Flight got cancelled so. held up

110
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.350
at the consulate with a bunch of other people trying to get home.

111
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.100
I'm sorry.

112
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.500
It could be worse. I mean.

113
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.850
They'll get home eventually. Apparently. the number of cases are lower down there.

114
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.200
Oh that's good. Bit of hope there.

115
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.500
Yeah. Bit of hope.

116
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.100
And how are you doing?

117
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.200
Fine.

118
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.100
Yeah fine. Um. Keeping busy.

119
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.500
Got plenty of work to do so uh...

120
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.900
What about you?

121
00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.700
Um just back in Maida Vale again.

122
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.000
Oh. My sister. you know I said she was studying sports medicine.

123
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.000
Yeah.

124
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:10.900
She's been pulled into the NHS so none of us are allowed out really. High risk. You know.

125
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.000
Bless her though. I mean. the real heroes.

126
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.600
Yeah. She's the best.

127
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.200
I miss you.

128
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.400
I know.

129
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.100
I wasn't planning on calling but. given the time right now.

130
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Shame we couldn't have figured this out before lockdown.

131
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.800
Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.600
No. It's fine though. I just want to make this work.

133
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.100
I mean when this is all over. Once we're back in uni

134
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.200
we can continue what we were doing and focus on us.

135
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.300
Yeah. Yeah that'd be great.

136
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.300
You don't sound so thrilled. What's up?

137
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.700
Nothing.

138
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.000
Nothing. I just um-

139
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.000
I don't wanna talk about it.

140
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.200
You worried that much?

141
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.000
I didn't say that.

142
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.300
Say something at least? You know we shouldn't stop having these-

143
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.000
CALL DROPS

144
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.500
I don't know what she expects me to say to her.

145
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.500
I don't think she even understands that I'm upset.

146
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.500
You just- you don't care. You don't care what happened.

147
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.650
You don't care about how it affected me.

148
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.650
I do. You never wanted to talk about it.

149
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.300
Can you blame me?

150
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.000
Why him?

151
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.500
Of all the people why him? he's such a-

152
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.700
Fucking dickhead. I hate that guy.

153
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.300
I know. It was just one time.

154
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:12.400
I know. It was just one time.
I don't want to dwell on the past. It's done now.

155
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.200
I don't want to dwell on the past. It's done now.

156
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.800
I just want to think of us.

157
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.500
You shouldn't have fucking slept with him then.

158
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
That's not fair.

159
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.700
That's not fair.

160
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.200
(Singing to Beethoven's 5th Symphony)
Soup soup soup soup.

161
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.000
Soup soup soup soup.

162
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.800
Soup soup soup soup soup soup...

163
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.000
Soup! Hm.

164
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.800
The Government in association with the World Health Organisation

165
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.150
has advised European nations to close borders immediately. In an attempt

166
00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.800
to limit international travel. The Prime Minister in his most recent conference

167
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.200
has enforced a longer quarantine period for the UK. Closing all of its borders for

168
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.100
the remainder of this month. The Chief of Staff at No.10 has outlined weekly

169
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.000
assessments to determine the end of these protocols but has warned that

170
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.200
the protocols in question will not ease for some time. We have been hearing

171
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.800
reports of thousands of UK citizens who are currently stuck abroad

172
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.600
with no knowledge of when they'll be able to return home.
170
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.400
Over two thousand flights have already been cancelled. With a further

173
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.000
five thousand more flights expected. following the collapse of

174
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.300
travel company Thomas Cook.

175
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.300
The current advice for anyone stuck abroad is to visit their

176
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.500
nation's local embassy and request emergency accommodation.

177
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.800
Perfect.

178
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.500
TV SOUNDS

179
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.500
TV SOUNDS

180
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
RINGTONE Beethoven's 5th Symphony.

181
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.900
Hello?

182
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.200
Hey. Just wanted to check up on you.

183
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.000
You sound a bit grim.

184
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Uh yeah. Yeah yeah. I think I caught it.

185
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
You holding up alright?

186
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.000
Uh. no.

187
00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:03.200
Well. my brother had it too. He's on the mend now too. So yeah.

188
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Just means me and my family can't leave for a few more weeks.

189
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.300
Well whatever it is. it is rough.
188
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.200
Yeah.

190
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.760
Haven't felt this bad for a while.

191
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.800
Yeah.

192
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.000
The treatment they sent us has done wonders for Will. He's past the worst of it now.

193
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.800
Yeah.

194
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.800
Well beer doesn't go with it. I can tell you that much.

195
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.900
Oh please take care of yourself.

196
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.800
Yeah yeah. I will. I will.

197
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.600
I won't be making that mistake for a while.

198
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.500
And what about your parents?

199
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:57.700
Parents? Oh. they're still out there. No idea when they'll be back.

200
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Feels like it's getting worse and worse.

201
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Hey. Where's your optimism gone?

202
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.300
Well things usually have to get worse before they get better.

203
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:15.800
There it is. (laughs and coughs)

204
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.200
We'll get there. But back to you. Stay warm. Keep drinking water

205
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.000
and take those tablets and you'll be fine.

206
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.700
CALL DROPS

207
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:35.000
Fuck sake.

208
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.100
We'll make it don't worry.

209
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.500
That's easy for you to say. You're stuck at home with you family.

210
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.500
You've still got me right here.

211
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.000
Oh lucky me.

212
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.000
Shut up.

213
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.000
It'll be over soon.

214
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.800
I'm sorry I slept with him.

215
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.300
No I'm sorry.

216
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:18.200
I'm sorry I got mad about it. We weren't even together at the time.

217
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:24.800
I feel bad about it. Just wish I properly tell you. I know it bothers you.

218
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.000
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter now.

219
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.200
This fucking sucks.

220
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.100
What does?

221
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:48.000
This. I'm alone. I'm ill and I'm fucking bored.

222
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.400
I just wish you were here.

223
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.000
I know.

224
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.700
I wish I was too.

225
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
PHONE RINGTONE

226
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Hello?

227
00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:55.850
Hey you.

228
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:57.800
How are things in the land of the living?

229
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Uh. Not a lot of living going on.

230
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:06.000
I can tell you it's not much better here. We've now been moved again

231
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.800
we've been put up in a hostel now with everyone else trying to get home.

232
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Have they given you bunk beds?

233
00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.200
Ah yes.

234
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.700
Have you got the top bunk?

235
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.000
Obviously. Didn't think your father would get it over me.

236
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.000
Oh no but seriously. how are you two?

237
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.850
Can't be right shoving you all in together like that.

238
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:32.500
They haven't even done any tests on anyone so who knows.

239
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.800
Your father is paranoid about his diabetes. He's running out of his tablets.

240
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.300
Can't the embassy provide?

241
00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.850
Different health care system here. Tried to ring the insurance companies

242
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:51.200
to arrange something different but it's all very frustrating.

243
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.500
Anyway. what about things your end? Taking care of the house?

244
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Yeah. Yeah.

245
00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.200
Actually. I’m- I’m ill.

246
00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:14.000
So. the government has sent me this. this care package with some medicine and stuff.

247
00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.500
But I've had to throw out some of the china I've used.

248
00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.400
What? Why would you need to throw away the china?

249
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:29.200
Well. it's what the kit says. Get rid of anything I've infected basically.

250
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.000
Didn't you try to steam them first?

251
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.700
No.

252
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.850
Oh God don't be so stupid. You can't...can’t you just disinfect them?

253
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.700
Well hang on. It's got my germs and stuff on them haven't they.

254
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.900
Oh come on. No.

255
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.800
All you need to do is run them through with very hot soapy water what the hell are you-

256
00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.900
HANGS UP

257
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.700
Fucking typical.

258
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.700
No concern for me whatsoever.

259
00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.200
Well consider what it's like for your father and me.

260
00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.400
Stuck in a foreign country trying to get home.

261
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.700
It's New Zealand. It's barely foreign.

262
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.500
Yes. because being shoved around from place to place is a blast.

263
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.500
It's still New Zealand. Like it's better than here.

264
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.500
Don't act like you don't want us there.

265
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.700
Of course I want you here! I'm ill. I'm fucking ill.

266
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:29.000
I'm miserable. and I’m sick of this pointless fucking lockdown.

267
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:34.000
It's no safer here than anywhere else. It's the same fucking virus wherever you go.

268
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:42.000
(Singing to the tune of “let it be”) Drinking Whiskey comforts me.

269
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Helps to ease the pain of Quarantine!

270
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.500
Quarantine. Quarantine. Quarantine.

271
00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:00.400
There will be an answer. Quarantine.

272
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.500
(hummin) Quarantine. There will be an answer. Quarantine.

273
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
TV SHOW JINGLE

274
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:11.000
Welcome back. Today we're in Oxfordshire. Taking a look at this late 19th century

275
00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:17.600
chestnut finish grandfather clock. Brought in for appraisal today by the Warren family.

276
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:32.000
You can see the fantastic detail in the face which tells us a lot about when this item was crafted.

277
00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.100
Clock perv.

278
00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.900
So? What if I do have a thing for old shit?

279
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.200
I couldn't care less how you get your rocks off mate. But feeling up all clocks. Bit weird.

280
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.900
At least I'm on television right now. What are you doing?

281
00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.400
Watching your shit TV show.

282
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.200
Go watch some shit on Netflix or something.

283
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.900
I would. but this crap is all I got.

284
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.500
What a bloody shame. No streaming services.

285
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.300
You should do a Netflix special. Oh wait no. You're stuck feeling up clocks.

286
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.900
If it's so shit. why are you still watching?

287
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.500
Do you know what when this thing is over you should try doing this job.

288
00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:36.500
Ah no wait. You don't have the depth. precision. the dedication to produce and host a programme of this quality.

289
00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:41.900
Ah yes. A programme built for the intellectuals among us.

290
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Very prestigious.

291
00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.300
So you're above everyone?

292
00:51:53.100 --> 00:52:00.000
I bet. You're having a wonderful time in all this. Mr Presenter.

293
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:11.900
I could claim to. You could also claim to. You have this big house.

294
00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:20.900
All this space. All to yourself. No children to look after or worry about. No rent to pay.

295
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.600
What could you possibly have to worry about?

296
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:32.800
But you're bored aren't you. Bored of your big TV and your home deliveries.

297
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:36.800
Bored of scrolling on your precious phone.

298
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.800
Why don't you whip it out right now and plug into the bullshit.

299
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.900
Posting and blogging about how creative you are.

300
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
How much you've accomplished in this time

301
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.500
How much you deserve praise

302
00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.200
No.

303
00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:01.900
Thousands of people are dying.

304
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000
But hey! I baked a banana bread.

305
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.750
You just want someone to acknowledge you exist.

306
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:17.900
Self-actualisation. You are sat right here feeling sorry for yourself.

307
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.500
Basting in your self-pity.

308
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.900
Have you called your parents yet? See how they're doing?

309
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:41.900
Am I right in saying your Dad is high risk? Stuck abroad.
Medication running low. Embassy won't help.

310
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:52.900
I don't even think you've given a second’s thought to how scared
they must be. Has it crossed your mind they might get infected?

311
00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:08.800
They might not make it home at all. But no. You’re sat here day after
pointless day. Consuming and whining. Slowly letting your body fuse

312
00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:19.900
into the John Lewis fucking furniture. This is your existential proof.
You do exist and you're a baby.

313
00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:32.900
You can blame everyone else. Blame anyone but yourself. The Government.
Corporations. The media. Well take aim and fire.

314
00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:39.900
Won't change anything. There's a bigger picture out there
you just don't see.

315
00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:55.500
It just doesn't matter that you're inconvenienced for a couple of months.
You see we still don't know how long this is going to go on for.

316
00:54:56.500 --> 00:55:00.000
We don't know how many more people it is going to take.

317
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:15.900
So ask yourself who's worth saving? Nurses? The police? artists or
scientists? Who's life is most important?

318
00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:24.900
What about you? Sat here in your arse crevice.

319
00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.000
Do you think you're worth saving?

320
00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:42.000
Fuck off!

321
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.900
What the fuck is that?

322
00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:57.900
Fuck it.

323
00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.900
Come on.

324
00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:08.900
When do the bins go out?

325
01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.900
Not fun.

326
01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:08.900
FOOTSTEPS UPSTAIRS.

327
01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.900
WATER DRIPPING

328
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.900
All this water for one person?

329
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.900
Bit greedy.

330
01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.900
If you'd asked nicely.

331
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.900
What? You would have shared? Sure.

332
01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:45.900
All this food. All this space. Practically luxury.

333
01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:47.900
This is my home.

334
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:56.900
Right. You could afford all this? Mummy and Daddy's house?

335
01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.900
Where are they?

336
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:15.900
You all by yourself? Lucky you got me here to keep you company.

337
01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:45.900
Hey. Oi oi oi.

338
01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:57.900
I haven't got much here. I'm trying to make that last.

339
01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:06.900
Fuck off!
Try that again and I blow your fucking brains out!

340
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:50.900
You're a smart boy. Saved up all your food. Smart. Most weren't.
Fuck off.

341
01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:06.900
I haven't seen another person in ten days. So I'm gonna talk
your ear off if you like it or not.

342
01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:17.900
Don't know what your missing out in here. You'd love it out there.

343
01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.900
It's all very refreshing.

344
01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.900
What's your name?

345
01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:52.900
Tough nut. Like that. It's alright. Used to talking to myself. When
you're alone this long you start imagining having company.

346
01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:14.900
Love this tinned pastas.

347
01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:22.900
Can you please just leave?

348
01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.900
No. I don't think I will.

349
01:15:53.100 --> 01:16:01.800
Besides I got nowhere to be. You know this house is miles from
anywhere. Must of crossed a million miles of fields

350
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.900
before finding this place. Was glad to find it though let
me tell you. Was in London a few weeks ago.

351
01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:22.900
I saw this banker shoving everything into this car. Ornaments.
Tacky paintings. You know the important stuff.

352
01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.900
All into the back of this oversized Bmer.

353
01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.400
Then we came along.

354
01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:58.900
Didn't used to rob people. But the whole went to shit. Do what you can.

355
01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:06.900
Not sure if leaving town was the right choice. Had no idea
where I was going.

356
01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:12.900
No way I was hanging about in that mess know what I mean.

357
01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:18.900
Too many crowds. Too much fighting.

358
01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:27.900
Just turned crazy.

359
01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:38.400
You've got it made here. Totally alone out here.

360
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:43.900
I bet nobody bothers you.

361
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.900
Well. Almost no one.

362
01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.900
Nice home you've got here.

363
01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:22.900
Mind if I take a look around? I've spent a long time
trying to get right here.

364
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.900
I'm going to take my sweet time.

365
01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.900
Yes.

366
01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.900
Come on. Come on.

367
01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.900
THIEF: Cheeky fucker.

368
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.900
Hoarding bottles of this are we. Lucky bastard.

369
01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:41.900
Strong stuff. Your fuse box is out as well. Might wanna get that looked at.

370
01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.900
What a warm reception.

371
01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.000
Shut the fuck up.

372
01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:36.500
All I wanted was some water.

373
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:44.500
I would have given you some if you hadn't broken in and tried to kill me.

374
01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.500
When did I try to kill you?

375
01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:48.500
You pushed me down the fucking stairs.

376
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:55.500
Right. Sorry about that.

377
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:59.500
Would it help if I told you I was a nurse?

378
01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:10.900
You had this on you as well.

379
01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:15.500
Just be thankful I didn't use it on you.

380
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.500
Fake gun trick was pretty good.

381
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.500
Fooled you.
Almost.

382
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:36.500
I'd have let you off if it wasn't for this. But this…
(coughing)

383
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.500
I feel like shit.
(laughs) Like I care.

384
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.500
Come off it Superman.

385
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.500
Like I could take someone down like you.

386
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.500
So got it?
I avoided it for weeks.

387
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.500
Some dick stole my pills.
Some dick like YOU stole your pills.

388
01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:12.900
You don’t know how lucky you are out here by yourself.

389
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.500
You keep saying that. Why?

390
01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.800
There's no water.
What?

391
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:28.500
There's no water. Reservoirs ran dry. people started looting. riots. It's wild out there.

392
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.500
Do you have any idea what's going on?

393
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.500
Oh my God. You don't do you?

394
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.500
How long you been alone for?

395
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.500
And that's why you broke in? To loot?

396
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.500
No. I was just desperate.

397
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.500
(laughs) You're full of shit.

398
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.500
Yeah? It won't last forever.

399
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:21.500
You'll run out soon too and more people like me will come around. It’s just a matter of time.

400
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.500
Whatever you say.

401
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.500
WATER GURGLES

402
01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.500
Fuck fuck fuck.

403
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.500
Fuck.

404
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.500

408
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.500
PIPE GURGLES.

409
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.500
DISTANT WHISPERS

410
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.500
What were you expecting?

411
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.500
An angel to come down from above to bring back your prime time TV?

412
01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.500
Can you blame a guy for trying?

413
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.500
Sure. Sitting in your dust castle. Thinking of better days.

414
01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.400
Eating out of those.

415
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
It's a nice castle.

416
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.500
How do those beans taste now?

417

Shower doesn't work.

420
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.500
You're dying in here.

421
01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:02.500
Well you know what? I'd rather die in here than die out there with everyone else.

422
01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:08.500
It's no safer in here than it is anywhere else.
It's the same fucking virus wherever you go.

423
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:23.500
Alright. What's keeping you here?
What the hell are you waiting for?

424
01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.900
I’m waiting for them to come home.

425
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.500
No one's coming home.

426
01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:44.500
