3
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.548
- I mean. you've
barely done anything

4
00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:25.879
since you've gotten here.

5
00:02:25.914 --> 00:02:28.750
All right. you spend most
of your time upstairs.

6
00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:31.951
You only come down to
grab food or to watch TV

7
00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:33.689
once we've gone to bed!

8
00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:35.625
I mean. you can't
even be bothered

9
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.726
to have dinner with
us most of the time.

10
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:40.861
And now. you wanna take off?

11
00:02:40.896 --> 00:02:44.436
To go god knows where to
take part in god knows what?

12
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:46.603
- I told you. it's
a sleep study.

13
00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:49.408
- Right. and that's
all you've told me.

14
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.808
I don't know why you're playing
this so secretively. Wanda.

15
00:02:53.843 --> 00:02:55.645
it's like you're planning
a jail break or something.

16
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.613
- Aren't I. though?

17
00:02:56.648 --> 00:02:58.747
I'm a grown woman. yet
I feel as if I need

18
00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:01.816
to ask your permission
to go and do what I want!

19
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.324
- You're right.

20
00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.557
You are a grown woman.

21
00:03:06.592 --> 00:03:08.856
Living rent free in our house.

22
00:03:10.497 --> 00:03:12.728
- I'm sorry that my divorce
was such an inconvenience

23
00:03:12.763 --> 00:03:13.927
for you. Lucas.

24
00:03:13.962 --> 00:03:16.699
- Oh. please don't
even start with that.

25
00:03:17.867 --> 00:03:21.671
- This has nothing to
do with that. all right?

26
00:03:21.706 --> 00:03:23.871
We are more than happy
to open our home to you.

27
00:03:23.906 --> 00:03:26.907
but the issue I have
is for weeks now.

28
00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:29.778
you've been saying. you're
gonna go buy your own car.

29
00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:31.912
which you haven't done. right?

30
00:03:31.947 --> 00:03:34.882
You've also said that you
were gonna find a job.

31
00:03:34.917 --> 00:03:37.687
You haven't even filled
out an application.

32
00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:40.756
You blame your lack of
motivation on your anxiety

33
00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:44.562
and your depression. but you
can't even pick up the phone

34
00:03:44.597 --> 00:03:46.828
to make a doctor's
appointment. all right?

35
00:03:46.863 --> 00:03:49.732
I mean. I'm asking
simple questions

36
00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:51.767
and all I'm getting
are dramatics.

37
00:03:51.802 --> 00:03:52.668
- Dramatics?

38
00:03:52.703 --> 00:03:55.837
I'm not the one
who's being dramatic!

39
00:03:57.038 --> 00:04:01.447
Look. I'm just asking to
borrow the car for a few days.

40
00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:02.877
so I can drive to Mineral.

41
00:04:02.912 --> 00:04:07.915
a place where people are
expecting me to be. a job.

42
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.885
Isn't that what this
is really about?

43
00:04:12.757 --> 00:04:13.954
- What do you mean?

44
00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.055
- You think I'm milking this!

45
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.398
Wallowing in my own self pity.

46
00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:19.597
- Oh no. wait a minute. Wanda!

47
00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:21.434
- No. just hear me out!

48
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:26.065
Look. I understand. it's
been hard having me here.

49
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.441
I'm trying to get
back on my feet.

50
00:04:29.972 --> 00:04:34.513
I can't begin to thank
you enough for helping me.

51
00:04:35.813 --> 00:04:38.913
but now I just need
a little more help.

52
00:04:38.948 --> 00:04:42.488
I just need to borrow the
car and then I'll come back

53
00:04:42.523 --> 00:04:45.425
with a little money
and maybe then.

54
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.790
maybe then I can take
that next step forward.

55
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:52.531
- I just don't think
it's a good idea.

56
00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:53.961
- Why?

57
00:04:53.996 --> 00:04:56.832
- Something seems off
about this whole situation.

58
00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:01.606
- First. you want me to
go out and make money.

59
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.643
then you feel skeptical
about the work I did find

60
00:05:05.678 --> 00:05:08.041
and want me to stay back?

61
00:05:08.076 --> 00:05:10.945
Why don't you make up your
mind and get back to me?

62
00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:15.785
- I just think your time
would be better spent here

63
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.391
on something more practical.

64
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.055
Okay. listen. I'm not trying
to be an asshole here. I'm not!

65
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.597
When you and Glen got divorced.

66
00:05:25.632 --> 00:05:28.864
you said you needed some
time to be yourself.

67
00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:30.129
I'm sympathetic to that.

68
00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:35.442
I can't help but think you're
using this as an opportunity

69
00:05:35.477 --> 00:05:37.972
to take off and just escape
reality for a few days.

70
00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:41.008
- Is that so wrong?

71
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.120
- How do you even know that
this is a real thing. Wanda?

72
00:05:54.155 --> 00:05:59.158
I mean. you filled out some
clickbait survey online?

73
00:06:00.502 --> 00:06:01.864
What are you gonna
say when it turns out

74
00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:04.537
to be some sort of timeshare
pitch or something?

75
00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.737
- Well. I guess then
you'll get the pleasure

76
00:06:06.772 --> 00:06:08.508
of telling me I told you so.

77
00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:16.912
Please. Lucas. I need to go.

78
00:06:16.947 --> 00:06:19.013
I'd much rather drive
myself there and back

79
00:06:19.048 --> 00:06:21.686
rather than. I don't
know. hitchhiking.

80
00:06:21.721 --> 00:06:24.458
- Oh. god. there's
the dramatics again.

81
00:06:24.493 --> 00:06:25.426
- Gloria.
- Jesus.

82
00:06:26.627 --> 00:06:30.222
- It's late. let's
just call it a night.

83
00:06:30.257 --> 00:06:32.565
We can talk about it
again in the morning.

84
00:06:34.833 --> 00:06:36.998
- I'll have to leave by
at least one o'clock.

85
00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:39.638
- Well. whose fault is that.

86
00:06:39.673 --> 00:06:41.101
that you waited till
the last minute?

87
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.578
Let's just. let's go to bed.

88
00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:48.713
We'll talk about it
again tomorrow. okay?

89
00:06:48.748 --> 00:06:51.111
Listen. at the table.

90
00:06:52.213 --> 00:06:53.817
we can have some breakfast.

91
00:06:54.952 --> 00:06:56.556
All right. at a decent hour.

92
00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:00.890
Okay?

93
00:07:00.925 --> 00:07:02.463
- Fine. whatever.

94
00:08:28.683 --> 00:08:31.046
- Boo.

95
00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:32.113
What's up?

96
00:08:33.655 --> 00:08:36.084
- I thought Gloria
made you quit smoking.

97
00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:38.185
- Yeah. no. she did.

98
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.327
Looks like sneaking out
runs in the family. huh?

99
00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:50.868
- I wasn't. I was just
gonna run to the store.

100
00:08:50.903 --> 00:08:53.332
- I never thought you'd
actually swipe my car. Wanda.

101
00:08:54.302 --> 00:08:55.675
- Lucas-

102
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.006
- You've got some
balls. you know that?

103
00:09:00.044 --> 00:09:01.076
- I need to go.

104
00:09:03.245 --> 00:09:04.079
- Go.

105
00:09:06.853 --> 00:09:07.885
Seriously. it's okay.

106
00:09:08.987 --> 00:09:12.087
You can go. I get it.

107
00:09:12.122 --> 00:09:16.190
- I really am just
trying to work on myself.

108
00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:17.895
- Yeah. clearly.

109
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.997
I mean the old Wanda. she'd
still be upstairs in her room

110
00:09:21.032 --> 00:09:22.097
sulking right now. so.

111
00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:25.771
- What are you
gonna tell Gloria?

112
00:09:28.072 --> 00:09:31.139
- You know. I don't know.

113
00:09:31.174 --> 00:09:34.978
but we'll talk about
it in the morning.

114
00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.048
But hey. do me a favor

115
00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:42.084
and bring my car back in
one piece though. okay?

116
00:09:42.119 --> 00:09:44.218
Otherwise we are
both gonna get it.

117
00:09:47.828 --> 00:09:49.025
I love you. sis.

118
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:50.895
You know that.

119
00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:56.164
I know you're gonna find what
you're looking for. okay?

120
00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.675
Get outta here before
you freeze to death.

121
00:10:05.274 --> 00:10:07.109
Hey. do me a favor.
though. and pick that up.

122
00:10:07.144 --> 00:10:09.683
I don't want Gloria to find it.

123
00:11:55.516 --> 00:11:58.319
- Excuse me. Miss.
you wouldn't happen

124
00:11:58.354 --> 00:12:00.222
to be Wanda Fulcia. would you?

125
00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:03.093
- Yes. I am.

126
00:12:03.128 --> 00:12:07.196
- My name's Victor. I'm the
assistant to Dr. Pretorius.

127
00:12:07.231 --> 00:12:08.230
- All right.

128
00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:11.365
- If you'd just follow
me up to the old school.

129
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.971
that's where you'll be staying.

130
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.468
- The address brought me here.

131
00:12:15.503 --> 00:12:18.273
- Yeah. the Google Maps

132
00:12:18.308 --> 00:12:20.814
doesn't really pick up
the building very well.

133
00:12:22.345 --> 00:12:23.311
Small towns like this.

134
00:12:25.381 --> 00:12:27.887
- What did you say
your name was again?

135
00:12:27.922 --> 00:12:29.548
- Victor Fair. ma'am.

136
00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:32.386
- And you
work for the doctor?

137
00:12:32.421 --> 00:12:34.289
- That is what I said. isn't it?

138
00:12:38.493 --> 00:12:40.328
Follow me up to the
old school house.

139
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.330
They're expecting you.

140
00:14:19.495 --> 00:14:21.495
Don't you wanna get your things?

141
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.431
- I didn't bring
anything with me.

142
00:14:26.337 --> 00:14:29.404
- All right. I'll
get the doctor.

143
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:10.340
- This used to be the
embalming room. you know?

144
00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:11.407
- Jesus Christ.

145
00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:14.542
You scared the shit out of me.

146
00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:18.513
- Name's Margarite. but
my friends call me Margo.

147
00:16:18.548 --> 00:16:20.581
- Oh. so you're not the doctor?

148
00:16:20.616 --> 00:16:24.486
- Nope. like I
said. name's Margo.

149
00:16:26.688 --> 00:16:29.359
I was joking. you know?

150
00:16:29.394 --> 00:16:30.624
- What?

151
00:16:30.659 --> 00:16:33.066
- I was joking about it
being an embalming room.

152
00:16:34.861 --> 00:16:36.597
- I figured as much.

153
00:16:38.766 --> 00:16:43.076
- Well. aren't you
gonna tell me your name?

154
00:16:43.111 --> 00:16:46.541
- Duh. Wanda. Wanda Fulcia.

155
00:16:46.576 --> 00:16:49.214
- Mm. we've been expecting you.

156
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:50.545
- You work for the doctor?

157
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.185
- Oh. no. I didn't
know who he was

158
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.384
until I got the email saying

159
00:16:54.419 --> 00:16:57.519
this was a quote unquote
"sleep experiment."

160
00:16:57.554 --> 00:16:58.586
- Right.

161
00:16:59.589 --> 00:17:01.424
- But don't worry.

162
00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:03.459
Everything seems to
be on the up and up.

163
00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:06.099
- What?

164
00:17:06.134 --> 00:17:07.595
- Well. that's what you're
worried about. isn't it?

165
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.828
That this was yet
another let down.

166
00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:12.534
or better yet.
something sinister?

167
00:17:13.702 --> 00:17:15.537
- How do you know
what I'm thinking?

168
00:17:15.572 --> 00:17:17.737
- You wear your thoughts
on your sleeve. Wanda.

169
00:17:17.772 --> 00:17:19.640
- Ah. there you are.

170
00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:25.316
I'm Dr. Richard Pretorius.
this here is Theodore Olson.

171
00:17:25.351 --> 00:17:26.548
- Hi.

172
00:17:26.583 --> 00:17:28.451
- And you've already
met Victor. I assume.

173
00:17:28.486 --> 00:17:30.585
- Hi. it's nice to meet you.

174
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.454
My name is Wanda.

175
00:17:31.489 --> 00:17:33.720
- Wanda Fulcia.

176
00:17:33.755 --> 00:17:35.854
Yeah. we've been expecting you.

177
00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:38.362
- Ah. now it's a party!

178
00:17:38.397 --> 00:17:40.661
We're just waiting on one more.

179
00:17:40.696 --> 00:17:43.202
- If y'all just follow me
to the back of the room now.

180
00:17:43.237 --> 00:17:45.138
we can perform the
exam while we wait.

181
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.670
- It's extremely invasive.

182
00:17:56.745 --> 00:17:58.283
- Now. take a deep breath.

183
00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:03.123
And again.

184
00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:14.332
- Well. Doctor. am I dying?

185
00:18:15.368 --> 00:18:16.862
- We're all dying. Ms. Fulcia.

186
00:18:16.897 --> 00:18:18.732
it's just a matter of how long.

187
00:18:25.807 --> 00:18:29.479
- Well. we're going to use this
as the main operating room.

188
00:18:32.253 --> 00:18:33.648
The center for operations.

189
00:18:34.882 --> 00:18:37.322
- Mm. cheerful.

190
00:18:37.357 --> 00:18:38.719
- Oh. I don't know.

191
00:18:40.558 --> 00:18:44.428
Nothing is more comforting
than my sixth grade math class.

192
00:18:44.463 --> 00:18:46.694
- Oh. so you're
from around here?

193
00:18:46.729 --> 00:18:48.564
- Oh. no. no. no. no.

194
00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:51.435
I grew up in Idaho
Falls. actually.

195
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.768
I just mean that.
well. you know.

196
00:18:54.803 --> 00:18:56.704
once you've seen one
small town school.

197
00:18:58.004 --> 00:18:59.377
- EverywheresVille. U.S.A.

198
00:18:59.412 --> 00:19:00.312
- Yes. look. believe it or not.

199
00:19:00.347 --> 00:19:01.577
until fairly recently.

200
00:19:01.612 --> 00:19:04.679
this school was used
as a overflow ward

201
00:19:04.714 --> 00:19:07.913
for the local hospital
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

202
00:19:07.948 --> 00:19:09.684
Now it was supposed
to be torn down

203
00:19:09.719 --> 00:19:11.752
when the city commissioned
a new building

204
00:19:11.787 --> 00:19:13.424
to be built in town.

205
00:19:13.459 --> 00:19:16.394
But luckily my funding
came through just in time.

206
00:19:16.429 --> 00:19:17.758
It's a perfect place

207
00:19:17.793 --> 00:19:19.496
to conduct group
studies. don't you think?

208
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.828
More than accommodating lodging

209
00:19:21.863 --> 00:19:24.237
with plenty of living space

210
00:19:24.272 --> 00:19:26.866
and quite the aura
of academia to it.

211
00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:29.638
The plan is for
doctors like myself

212
00:19:29.673 --> 00:19:34.346
to use this sort of shared
space to conduct our research.

213
00:19:35.481 --> 00:19:37.349
- What is it exactly
that you're researching?

214
00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:39.813
- A criminally under
researched phenomenon

215
00:19:39.848 --> 00:19:41.584
known as sleep paralysis.

216
00:19:42.785 --> 00:19:44.752
- But I've never
experienced sleep paralysis.

217
00:19:44.787 --> 00:19:46.490
- Exactly why you were chosen.

218
00:19:46.525 --> 00:19:47.590
- I don't understand.

219
00:19:48.693 --> 00:19:51.462
- The good doctor here
thinks he can give it to us.

220
00:19:52.696 --> 00:19:54.696
- Look. I'm not taking
any experimental drugs!

221
00:19:54.731 --> 00:19:59.030
- You won't have to. this is
strictly a holistic study.

222
00:19:59.065 --> 00:20:03.034
Now all I need is your
time and open minds.

223
00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:04.475
As soon as our
last guests arrive.

224
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.742
I'll be more than
happy to fill you in.

225
00:20:07.777 --> 00:20:08.609
- Hello?

226
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:12.384
- It just so happens
that time is now.

227
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.726
- Ah. fuck me.
the welcome wagon?

228
00:20:23.761 --> 00:20:27.025
- Oh. you must be Porter
Watson. I'm Dr. Pretorius.

229
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.697
- 'Sup. Doc.

230
00:20:28.732 --> 00:20:29.731
Now you got a place where
I can stash my stuff?

231
00:20:29.767 --> 00:20:31.403
- Yes. I'll have my
assistant Victor show you

232
00:20:31.438 --> 00:20:32.866
to your room here shortly.

233
00:20:32.901 --> 00:20:33.999
- Perfect.

234
00:20:34.034 --> 00:20:35.770
Baby.

235
00:20:35.805 --> 00:20:38.344
Hey. yo. Doc. how
about introducing me

236
00:20:38.379 --> 00:20:40.071
to the rest of the band?

237
00:20:40.106 --> 00:20:41.578
Cleopatra. isn't it?

238
00:20:41.613 --> 00:20:44.383
- Margarite Swanson. our
resident fortune teller.

239
00:20:44.418 --> 00:20:46.011
- But my friends call me Margo.

240
00:20:46.046 --> 00:20:47.881
- Logger. Theodore Randolph.

241
00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:48.915
- Hey!
- What's up. man?

242
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.588
- And Mrs. Wanda Fulcia.

243
00:20:51.623 --> 00:20:53.821
- Miss Wanda Fulcia.

244
00:20:53.856 --> 00:20:55.460
- So I'm afraid I didn't catch

245
00:20:55.495 --> 00:20:58.760
your social security occupation
for you there. Miss Fulcia.

246
00:21:00.126 --> 00:21:02.467
- Well. I'm in a bit
of a transitional
period at the moment.

247
00:21:02.502 --> 00:21:05.030
- Ha. a woman
after my own heart.

248
00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:07.340
Well. I gotta. say if you
two ladies are the specters

249
00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:08.572
that haunt these gloomy halls.

250
00:21:08.607 --> 00:21:11.036
well. I'm still
glad that I came.

251
00:21:11.071 --> 00:21:12.774
- Now that you're all here.

252
00:21:12.809 --> 00:21:14.842
Can I offer you all a drink
back in the operations room?

253
00:21:15.812 --> 00:21:16.845
- Yo. this surprise party

254
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.846
just keeps getting better
and better. don't it?

255
00:21:23.589 --> 00:21:24.423
- And again.

256
00:21:30.893 --> 00:21:32.761
All done. you passed.

257
00:21:32.796 --> 00:21:34.895
- You know. I didn't
hear nothing about
them flying colors.

258
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.930
You're awfully thorough for
a sleep study there. Doc.

259
00:21:36.965 --> 00:21:39.372
- My research is
awfully thorough.

260
00:21:39.407 --> 00:21:40.802
- And what is that exactly?

261
00:21:40.837 --> 00:21:43.937
- We were just getting
to that when you arrived.

262
00:21:43.972 --> 00:21:46.005
- Before the welcome
wagon was summoned.

263
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.743
- My sincerest apologies. y'all.

264
00:21:47.778 --> 00:21:50.581
- Quite the hassle. you
really threw a wrench

265
00:21:50.616 --> 00:21:51.945
in the whole operation. man.

266
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.717
- Yeah. Mama says I got
a knack for doing that.

267
00:21:54.752 --> 00:21:56.851
- You best get a hold
of your class. Doctor.

268
00:21:56.886 --> 00:21:58.820
- Yes. as some of
you may have guessed.

269
00:21:58.855 --> 00:22:00.151
I belonged to a collective

270
00:22:00.186 --> 00:22:02.956
of independently
funded researchers

271
00:22:02.991 --> 00:22:05.959
dedicated to solving
the biggest mystery

272
00:22:05.994 --> 00:22:09.501
since man first arrived on
the scene. the human mind.

273
00:22:10.702 --> 00:22:12.163
- Couldn't have picked
a better study group.

274
00:22:12.198 --> 00:22:13.538
- I'll say.

275
00:22:13.573 --> 00:22:16.574
- Well. being
someone with degrees

276
00:22:16.609 --> 00:22:20.743
in both psychiatry
and hypnotherapy.

277
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.680
I've long been
fascinated with disorders

278
00:22:23.715 --> 00:22:27.079
that accompany
generalized anxiety.

279
00:22:27.114 --> 00:22:30.555
post traumatic stress
and obsessive compulsion.

280
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.691
- None of that was on
the survey. Doctor.

281
00:22:34.726 --> 00:22:35.890
- No. no. it wasn't.

282
00:22:37.564 --> 00:22:40.631
How many of you here have
heard of sleep paralysis?

283
00:22:41.997 --> 00:22:44.998
Good. I can spare you
most of the gory details

284
00:22:45.033 --> 00:22:47.935
about shadow creatures
and witch demons.

285
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.200
Now. as you may have guessed.

286
00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:51.972
it has been proven that
the majority of people

287
00:22:52.007 --> 00:22:54.007
who experience sleep
paralysis and night terrors

288
00:22:54.042 --> 00:22:56.548
have also been diagnosed
with post traumatic stress

289
00:22:56.583 --> 00:22:58.077
and panic attacks.

290
00:22:58.112 --> 00:23:01.652
The reason for these outbursts

291
00:23:01.687 --> 00:23:04.985
is due to the overstimulation
of the amygdala

292
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.153
and the mid interior
singlet cortex.

293
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:12.190
The same center is of
course tied to nightmares.

294
00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:14.027
hence sleep paralysis.

295
00:23:14.062 --> 00:23:15.930
- You're losing me. Doc.

296
00:23:15.965 --> 00:23:17.800
- Yeah. can you fast
forward to the part

297
00:23:17.835 --> 00:23:20.506
where. I don't know.
we can understand.

298
00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:22.574
- Yeah. certainly.
my purpose here

299
00:23:22.609 --> 00:23:24.576
is to try and find
a way that we deal

300
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:27.040
with both sleep paralysis
and night terrors.

301
00:23:27.075 --> 00:23:30.076
though. the focus
is on the latter.

302
00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:32.683
Now. as I mentioned to
you. Wanda. previously.

303
00:23:32.718 --> 00:23:36.016
I don't plan on using
any experimental drugs.

304
00:23:36.051 --> 00:23:40.152
Similarly. I don't plan
on using electrotherapy

305
00:23:40.187 --> 00:23:44.893
or lobotomizing you. so
there's no need to worry.

306
00:23:44.928 --> 00:23:48.699
We aren't living in the
days of Dr. Frankenstein.

307
00:23:49.933 --> 00:23:54.837
I believe there is an option
for a more holistic approach.

308
00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.007
because the overstimulation
of this part of the brain

309
00:24:00.042 --> 00:24:02.240
is the reason for these issues.

310
00:24:02.275 --> 00:24:06.079
And through my
research into hypnosis

311
00:24:06.114 --> 00:24:08.950
and cognitive
behavioral therapy.

312
00:24:08.985 --> 00:24:11.623
I believe that we
can find a way to.

313
00:24:12.824 --> 00:24:16.089
you know. open the
door. if you will.

314
00:24:16.124 --> 00:24:18.025
to where these issues lie.

315
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.962
Now. I specifically
chose you four

316
00:24:20.997 --> 00:24:24.966
because of your lack of
experience to sleep paralysis.

317
00:24:25.001 --> 00:24:28.200
That is evidence that this
door has never been opened.

318
00:24:28.235 --> 00:24:31.071
but the goal through
understanding how to open it

319
00:24:31.106 --> 00:24:32.842
is then to understand how

320
00:24:32.877 --> 00:24:36.978
to reverse engineer
it closed again

321
00:24:37.013 --> 00:24:40.212
without the use of
psychotropic drugs.

322
00:24:40.247 --> 00:24:43.556
which ends up being
more than a mask

323
00:24:43.591 --> 00:24:46.020
for these demons.
rather than a solution.

324
00:24:46.055 --> 00:24:47.758
- How ghostly.

325
00:24:47.793 --> 00:24:51.289
- Ah. ah. ah. don't get
ghostly and ghoulish confused.

326
00:24:51.324 --> 00:24:52.730
that offends them.

327
00:24:52.765 --> 00:24:55.095
- Look. I'm training
on in layman's terms.

328
00:24:55.130 --> 00:25:00.100
the study itself. I'll be
hypnotizing you as a group.

329
00:25:01.169 --> 00:25:02.674
And with any luck.

330
00:25:02.709 --> 00:25:05.677
I will excite that part
of the unconscious mind

331
00:25:05.712 --> 00:25:08.977
and I'll monitor your sleep
habits for a couple of days.

332
00:25:09.012 --> 00:25:12.651
And if successful. I'll
reverse the process.

333
00:25:12.686 --> 00:25:16.050
- I'm sorry. you're
going to hypnotize us?

334
00:25:16.085 --> 00:25:18.250
- Now. that is ghostly.

335
00:25:18.285 --> 00:25:21.660
- Look. look. I can
assure you I am.

336
00:25:23.928 --> 00:25:25.994
I'm very experienced
and have been able

337
00:25:27.162 --> 00:25:29.063
to help people with
unlocking memories

338
00:25:29.098 --> 00:25:33.034
to further deal with their
trauma in therapy sessions.

339
00:25:33.069 --> 00:25:35.003
You know. you're in good hands.

340
00:25:35.038 --> 00:25:37.676
- I'm sorry for the skepticism.

341
00:25:39.141 --> 00:25:40.074
I just. I don't know.

342
00:25:41.682 --> 00:25:45.046
- Well. could be the biggest
trip I've ever taken.

343
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.950
I'm in.

344
00:25:47.985 --> 00:25:50.788
- Your sanity is
nothing to gamble with.

345
00:25:54.024 --> 00:25:56.662
- I've leveraged a lot more
than that for a dollar.

346
00:25:57.764 --> 00:25:59.192
- Here. here.

347
00:25:59.227 --> 00:26:01.359
- Man. I knew there was
something about you.

348
00:26:02.395 --> 00:26:03.999
- What do you mean?

349
00:26:04.034 --> 00:26:06.738
- I don't know. I just figured
you looked a bit strange

350
00:26:06.773 --> 00:26:08.102
to be a doctor.

351
00:26:08.137 --> 00:26:11.237
- Well. perception
is everything.

352
00:26:12.174 --> 00:26:14.977
- And your
name. Pretorius?

353
00:26:16.277 --> 00:26:20.048
- Well. it's half German.

354
00:26:20.985 --> 00:26:22.952
- Nah. no. that's not it.

355
00:26:24.153 --> 00:26:26.956
Yo. why do I feel like I've
heard that name before?

356
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:31.994
- Well. my great grandfather
was quite famous back home.

357
00:26:34.097 --> 00:26:35.899
- Huh?

358
00:26:35.934 --> 00:26:37.835
Okay. so at what point. Doc.

359
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.167
do you try to sell us your
tofu weed grass supplements

360
00:26:40.202 --> 00:26:41.135
outta the trunk?

361
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.940
- I take it you don't
believe in hypnosis

362
00:26:43.975 --> 00:26:47.108
as a legitimate form of therapy?

363
00:26:48.375 --> 00:26:51.783
- Nah. and I don't believe
in energy crystals either.

364
00:26:51.818 --> 00:26:55.853
- Ah. here I thought your
brutish persona was just an act.

365
00:26:55.888 --> 00:26:57.217
- Hey. look here. baby girl.

366
00:26:57.252 --> 00:26:59.219
I'm just as open
minded as the next guy.

367
00:26:59.254 --> 00:27:02.057
but this kind of
homeopathic stuff.

368
00:27:02.092 --> 00:27:03.157
it just ain't my jam.

369
00:27:04.259 --> 00:27:05.929
- Shocker.

370
00:27:05.964 --> 00:27:07.733
- Look. I'm just saying

371
00:27:07.768 --> 00:27:10.395
there's a reason why my grandma
lived to be 83 years old

372
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.167
and it wasn't because of
ginseng or water chestnuts.

373
00:27:14.335 --> 00:27:16.203
- Look. this might come
as a surprise to you.

374
00:27:16.238 --> 00:27:17.809
but just because
you kicked around

375
00:27:17.844 --> 00:27:19.239
the same city blocks
your whole life

376
00:27:19.274 --> 00:27:21.978
to become a what. amateur boxer.

377
00:27:22.013 --> 00:27:24.244
doesn't mean there isn't a
whole world of possibilities

378
00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:27.412
out there that you couldn't
even begin to imagine.

379
00:27:27.447 --> 00:27:32.450
- Listen. I'm not denying the
importance of modern medicine.

380
00:27:34.025 --> 00:27:38.159
Mr. Watson. my interest is
strictly in cognitive behavior-

381
00:27:38.194 --> 00:27:39.160
- And that's the thing.
that's what I mean

382
00:27:39.195 --> 00:27:41.030
with these whole people
that think smoking weed

383
00:27:41.065 --> 00:27:43.098
and chia seed oil is
the cure for everything.

384
00:27:43.133 --> 00:27:45.199
and that the ancient Chinese
had it all figured out

385
00:27:45.234 --> 00:27:47.069
with natural medicine.

386
00:27:47.104 --> 00:27:50.105
Even though the life
expectancies of a
1500 China was 25.

387
00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.909
- Ugh. you're all
over the place.

388
00:27:51.944 --> 00:27:53.207
I don't even know
what your point is.

389
00:27:53.242 --> 00:27:54.912
- All right. look.
my point is this.

390
00:27:54.947 --> 00:27:57.145
if you got sleeping issues.
they made a pill for it.

391
00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.017
- I know. there's a little
pill for everything.

392
00:28:01.052 --> 00:28:02.887
- Yeah. exactly.

393
00:28:02.922 --> 00:28:05.153
- No one's making you stay here.

394
00:28:05.188 --> 00:28:06.385
- Yeah.

395
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.057
- If you wanna leave.
the door's right there.

396
00:28:08.092 --> 00:28:10.158
- Whoa. whoa. chill. who
said anything about leaving?

397
00:28:10.193 --> 00:28:13.997
Look a couple hundred bucks to
play "Criss Angel Mindfreak."

398
00:28:14.032 --> 00:28:15.295
yeah. I'll stick around.

399
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.397
Even if it is to keep a
fair skeptical opinion.

400
00:28:18.432 --> 00:28:20.102
- Glad to hear it.

401
00:28:20.137 --> 00:28:24.139
Now. if the rest of you wish
to continue on with the study.

402
00:28:24.174 --> 00:28:26.878
we will begin first
thing tomorrow afternoon.

403
00:28:26.913 --> 00:28:29.881
and after dinner. I will
have you leave your keys

404
00:28:29.916 --> 00:28:32.246
and phone with my
assistant. Victor.

405
00:28:32.281 --> 00:28:36.349
who will return next Friday
after the exam is over.

406
00:28:37.286 --> 00:28:38.384
- Our keys?

407
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.829
- Have you ever heard of a
man named Kenneth Hawkins?

408
00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:50.363
So Kenneth. he suffered
from a ever-worsening

409
00:28:50.398 --> 00:28:55.401
sleep disorder. which
led him to sleep walk.

410
00:28:56.569 --> 00:29:00.373
So one night. he
climbed into his car.

411
00:29:00.408 --> 00:29:02.375
he drove up the wrong lane.

412
00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.213
just here on the
interstate. on I12.

413
00:29:07.514 --> 00:29:11.021
It was one of the many tragic
cases of sleep driving.

414
00:29:11.056 --> 00:29:13.353
- Man. that shit sound made up.

415
00:29:13.388 --> 00:29:15.322
- Most things do.
until it happens.

416
00:29:16.358 --> 00:29:20.063
Now. tonight. I
want you to relax.

417
00:29:20.098 --> 00:29:23.264
carry on the way you would
in any other setting.

418
00:29:23.299 --> 00:29:26.333
Then there's drink and
food in the cafeteria.

419
00:29:26.368 --> 00:29:30.040
and. hopefully. a
bottle of scotch.

420
00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.944
- Read my mind.

421
00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:35.375
Hey. maybe you are a
mystic after all. Doc.

422
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.283
Theo!

423
00:29:42.318 --> 00:29:43.350
Another one?

424
00:29:43.385 --> 00:29:44.450
- Hell yeah. player.

425
00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:52.029
- Hey. yo. Doc. you might have
to conjure some more Maker's.

426
00:29:52.064 --> 00:29:54.163
I don't imagine this'll
last the whole week.

427
00:29:55.463 --> 00:29:57.331
- Can't tell if you're
actually being funny

428
00:29:57.366 --> 00:29:59.432
or you really are that ignorant.

429
00:29:59.467 --> 00:30:01.071
- I don't think we drew.

430
00:30:01.106 --> 00:30:02.534
- Geez. I'm just breaking balls.

431
00:30:02.569 --> 00:30:05.339
- Mm. maybe somebody
ought to break yours.

432
00:30:06.375 --> 00:30:07.572
- Is that an invitation?

433
00:30:08.608 --> 00:30:10.212
Hey. what is it you do again?

434
00:30:10.247 --> 00:30:11.477
Voodoo practice?

435
00:30:11.512 --> 00:30:14.381
- I'm a bank teller.
but I also practice

436
00:30:14.416 --> 00:30:16.383
tarot card readings on YouTube.

437
00:30:16.418 --> 00:30:18.517
- So is she like the plant?

438
00:30:18.552 --> 00:30:20.387
- There is a world of difference

439
00:30:20.422 --> 00:30:24.424
between spiritualism.
hypnotherapy. and voodoo.

440
00:30:24.459 --> 00:30:26.327
- It's all shit. it's all crock.

441
00:30:26.362 --> 00:30:27.933
No offense. Doc.

442
00:30:27.968 --> 00:30:30.298
- None taken. your
skepticism is exactly

443
00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:32.135
why you were chosen.

444
00:30:33.237 --> 00:30:35.006
In order for the
study to be a success.

445
00:30:35.041 --> 00:30:37.943
I'll need to prove beyond
a shadow of a doubt.

446
00:30:37.978 --> 00:30:41.672
- Shadow of doubt. that
title suits you well.

447
00:30:41.707 --> 00:30:44.114
- Haven't you guys ever heard
of people being operated on

448
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:45.511
while being under hypnosis?

449
00:30:45.546 --> 00:30:47.447
- Shit. I've heard
a lot of things.

450
00:30:47.482 --> 00:30:49.284
- Then how do you
explain a surgical blade

451
00:30:49.319 --> 00:30:50.285
being stuck into someone

452
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.518
without them drawing a
single drop of blood?

453
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:55.422
- It's all bullshit.

454
00:30:55.457 --> 00:30:57.292
- I've actually seen it happen.

455
00:30:57.327 --> 00:30:58.260
- Really?

456
00:30:58.295 --> 00:31:00.427
- Yeah. it was at a show.

457
00:31:00.462 --> 00:31:02.297
- Well. there you have it.

458
00:31:02.332 --> 00:31:03.431
- I'm serious!

459
00:31:03.467 --> 00:31:05.102
I watched this guy get stuck
with a needle in his arm

460
00:31:05.137 --> 00:31:06.565
and he didn't even feel a thing.

461
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.006
- Interesting.

462
00:31:08.041 --> 00:31:11.372
Although. I wouldn't
exactly recommend it.

463
00:31:11.407 --> 00:31:14.177
hypnosis should only
really be performed

464
00:31:14.212 --> 00:31:16.410
by a proper licensed
hypnotherapist.

465
00:31:16.445 --> 00:31:19.281
- At the P.T. Barnum Institute.

466
00:31:20.218 --> 00:31:21.448
- Well. it should be used

467
00:31:21.483 --> 00:31:23.450
to create a state of
focus of attention.

468
00:31:23.485 --> 00:31:25.254
focused attention
in the treatment

469
00:31:25.289 --> 00:31:27.124
of a medical
psychological disorder.

470
00:31:28.391 --> 00:31:30.391
- What exactly is it
that you find so interesting

471
00:31:30.426 --> 00:31:31.931
about sleep paralysis?

472
00:31:34.232 --> 00:31:36.529
- Other than being a
victim of it. myself?

473
00:31:36.564 --> 00:31:38.102
- Really?

474
00:31:38.137 --> 00:31:42.568
- Well. during my nightmarish
years of internship

475
00:31:43.769 --> 00:31:48.343
at Mercy West. I was
so mentally exhausted

476
00:31:50.479 --> 00:31:54.514
and more anxious than my
conscious mind was aware of.

477
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:57.715
It was two or three
nights a week for a year.

478
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.158
- Jesus.

479
00:32:01.193 --> 00:32:02.522
I can't imagine.

480
00:32:02.557 --> 00:32:04.392
- You won't have
too long enough.

481
00:32:04.427 --> 00:32:07.461
- Well. yeah. I mean the
history also fascinated me.

482
00:32:07.496 --> 00:32:09.298
The first recorded
case of sleep paralysis

483
00:32:09.333 --> 00:32:12.565
wasn't documented until 1666

484
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.436
by Dutch physician who
referred to it as the Incubus.

485
00:32:16.703 --> 00:32:18.109
I mean. it's intriguing to me

486
00:32:18.144 --> 00:32:21.508
that over all these
hundreds of years.

487
00:32:21.543 --> 00:32:26.183
the symptoms and the experiences
have all remained the same.

488
00:32:26.218 --> 00:32:28.614
the same shadow-like
witch woman.

489
00:32:29.683 --> 00:32:31.419
most commonly
referred to as The Hag

490
00:32:31.454 --> 00:32:33.421
and no doubt having
something to do

491
00:32:33.456 --> 00:32:36.292
with our more animalistic
side of the brain.

492
00:32:36.327 --> 00:32:39.427
conjured up from that
deep dark primordial jelly

493
00:32:39.462 --> 00:32:42.034
that we inherited from
the time of the dinosaurs.

494
00:32:43.532 --> 00:32:45.301
- Mass suggestion. maybe.

495
00:32:45.336 --> 00:32:48.436
- The law of the time was
that. I mean. Edward Kelly.

496
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:51.472
who was a 17th
century necromancer

497
00:32:51.507 --> 00:32:54.574
who claimed to have the powers

498
00:32:54.609 --> 00:32:57.544
to communicate with
the dead was to blame.

499
00:32:59.152 --> 00:33:02.021
thinking he had cursed a
town with the devil's plague.

500
00:33:04.586 --> 00:33:07.158
Don't worry. I highly
doubt superstition

501
00:33:07.193 --> 00:33:09.160
and spiritualism is afoot.

502
00:33:09.822 --> 00:33:11.558
- Don't be so sure.

503
00:33:11.593 --> 00:33:15.265
- Uh. oh. way to
alienate your base there. Doc.

504
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.630
- There's just so much
we can't yet comprehend.

505
00:33:17.665 --> 00:33:19.500
and we don't know about
the universe around us.

506
00:33:19.535 --> 00:33:21.568
- So who's up for little music?

507
00:33:21.603 --> 00:33:22.702
I got my boombox.

508
00:33:22.738 --> 00:33:25.077
- One can be entirely faithful
to the path of inquiry

509
00:33:25.112 --> 00:33:26.771
and honesty while also embracing

510
00:33:26.806 --> 00:33:29.543
the totality of your
human experience.

511
00:33:29.578 --> 00:33:32.315
- I'm gonna
go get my boombox.

512
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.383
- It would be ignorant
as truth seekers

513
00:33:34.418 --> 00:33:36.583
to be closed-minded
to any possibility.

514
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.455
- Well. I suppose you're right.

515
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.326
Until fairly recently.

516
00:33:43.361 --> 00:33:44.723
we were convinced that the atom

517
00:33:44.758 --> 00:33:49.134
was the smallest unit of

- Not exactly the most
comforting comparison to make.

520
00:33:55.703 --> 00:33:57.241
- Perhaps not.

521
00:33:59.245 --> 00:34:01.443

00:34:01.478 --> 00:34:03.412

Why. are you propositioning me?

debilitating condition.

542
00:34:56.236 --> 00:34:59.600
I've got two left feet. and
they plagued me my whole life.

543
00:34:59.635 --> 00:35:02.768

you know. in a sense.

544
00:35:03.606 --> 00:35:05.606
Shyness or anxiety.

549
00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.529
drinking whiskey in
an elementary school.

550
00:35:27.564 --> 00:35:28.398
- Interesting.

551
00:35:29.367 --> 00:35:31.698
You know. this here is
precisely the reason

552
00:35:31.733 --> 00:35:32.963
I got into psychiatry.

553
00:35:32.998 --> 00:35:34.767
- Getting smashed in a school?

554
00:35:34.802 --> 00:35:36.604
- No. that's one
of the many perks.

555
00:35:36.639 --> 00:35:39.937
But understanding
all the personalities

556
00:35:39.972 --> 00:35:41.840

557
00:35:41.875 --> 00:35:43.809
figuring out what
makes them tick.

558
00:35:48.948 --> 00:35:52.290
What are you hoping to
gain from this really?

559
00:35:52.325 --> 00:35:53.852
- What do you mean?

560
00:35:53.887 --> 00:35:58.230
- Well. you don't seem
to fall on either side

561

of the warring fences.

562
00:36:01.631 --> 00:36:03.829

563
00:36:05.503 --> 00:36:07.635
to be overly concerned
about the payment.

564
00:36:08.869 --> 00:36:13.641

just like the others.

565
00:36:13.676 --> 00:36:17.480

in my hypothesis.

conclusion do you come to?

00:39:38.683 --> 00:39:39.484
- Okay.

614
00:39:44.788 --> 00:39:45.622
Let's begin.

615
00:39:48.627 --> 00:39:53.058
Now. please close your eyes
and take a deep breath.

616
00:39:59.704 --> 00:40:03.475
Now. listen for a moment.

617
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:06.907
Listen to the sounds around you.

618
00:40:08.911 --> 00:40:13.914
Just let yourself sink into
the grooves of the chair.

619
00:40:16.721 --> 00:40:21.724
Fix your eyes on a
spot in the dark.

620
00:40:24.762 --> 00:40:29.765
It doesn't matter where. just
fix your eyes on the spot

621
00:40:32.297 --> 00:40:36.739
in the dark and begin to relax.

622
00:40:39.007 --> 00:40:41.546
If you have any thoughts.

623
00:40:41.581 --> 00:40:46.551
just let them drift
through your mind

624
00:40:47.752 --> 00:40:52.689
like beautiful clouds
across a clear blue sky.

625
00:40:54.594 --> 00:40:58.860
They drift through your
mind and away from you.

626
00:40:59.995 --> 00:41:04.569
through your mind and
away as you relax.

627
00:41:08.135 --> 00:41:11.103
deeper. deeper.

628
00:41:12.304 --> 00:41:15.613
deeper. relaxed.

629
00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:19.881
That's it. just
let go and relax.

630
00:41:21.049 --> 00:41:25.051
Now I want you to imagine
a staircase standing

631
00:41:26.989 --> 00:41:31.794
in front of you with 10 wide

632
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:35.094
safe stairs down.

633
00:41:35.998 --> 00:41:40.902
down to a perfect relaxation.

634
00:41:42.807 --> 00:41:47.106
Down to peace and contentment.

635
00:41:48.274 --> 00:41:52.947
Down towards happiness
that you deserve.

636
00:41:54.984 --> 00:41:57.754
As I count down from 10.

637
00:41:58.988 --> 00:42:02.088
I want you to take one
step with each number.

638
00:42:05.093 --> 00:42:08.567
One step down the staircase.

639
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:14.331
10. nine. eight.

640
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:19.270
There's some letters at
the bottom of the stairs

641
00:42:19.305 --> 00:42:22.273
that are out of focus.

642
00:42:23.716 --> 00:42:24.583
Can you see that?

643
00:42:26.653 --> 00:42:30.853
Seven. six. five.

644
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.858
The letters are being clearer

645
00:42:37.191 --> 00:42:39.290
the closer we get.

646
00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:46.770
Four. three. two. one.

647
00:42:49.038 --> 00:42:50.136
You can almost see it now.

648
00:42:52.712 --> 00:42:54.173
The letters spell

649
00:42:57.849 --> 00:42:58.650
trance.

650
00:43:34.182 --> 00:43:35.687
- Wake up!

651
00:43:36.448 --> 00:43:38.987
Somebody wake me up!

652
00:43:46.029 --> 00:43:47.094
- Wake up.

653
00:43:50.836 --> 00:43:51.868
- Holy shit.

654
00:43:51.903 --> 00:43:53.166
- How do you feel. all right?

655
00:43:53.201 --> 00:43:55.366
- Fuck no.
- That was intense.

656
00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:59.271
- I think I need a minute.

657
00:44:28.203 --> 00:44:29.235
- You okay?

658
00:44:35.815 --> 00:44:38.750
- I've never experienced
anything like that before.

659
00:44:39.951 --> 00:44:43.018
- Right. it was
like a nightmare.

660
00:44:43.053 --> 00:44:43.920
The screaming.

661
00:44:46.056 --> 00:44:47.924
- You heard screaming?

662
00:44:47.959 --> 00:44:50.157
- Yeah. someone screaming
like "Wake me up!"

663
00:44:53.965 --> 00:44:55.261
- What do you remember seeing?

664
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.838
Dr. Pretorius. you
gotta hear this.

665
00:45:00.873 --> 00:45:03.302
- Wanda and I had
similar experiences.

666
00:45:03.337 --> 00:45:06.173
- The woman. the black figure?

667
00:45:06.208 --> 00:45:08.780
- The fuck you trying
to pull here. Doc?

668
00:45:08.815 --> 00:45:10.045
- It's remarkable.

669
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.508
- Are you telling me we
all saw the same thing?

670
00:45:11.543 --> 00:45:13.378
- Or went to the same place?

671
00:45:13.413 --> 00:45:15.149
- How is that possible?

672
00:45:15.184 --> 00:45:18.053
- Look. a form of mass
suggestion. I suspect.

673
00:45:18.088 --> 00:45:19.285
- How is that?

674
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.891
- Look. we all sat
around and discussed

675
00:45:20.926 --> 00:45:23.322
the common experiences of
sleep paralysis together.

676
00:45:23.357 --> 00:45:26.391
Your unconscious minds
drew on that conversation

677
00:45:26.426 --> 00:45:28.558
and the projections it used.

678
00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:30.527
- So how do you
explain the screaming?

679
00:45:30.562 --> 00:45:33.937
- Right. "Someone wake me up."

680
00:45:33.972 --> 00:45:36.038
That shit wasn't part
of the discussion. Doc.

681
00:45:36.073 --> 00:45:39.338
- I knew I never should have
fucking left Idaho Falls.

682
00:45:39.373 --> 00:45:43.276
This whole thing has bad juju
written all over it. man!

683
00:45:43.311 --> 00:45:44.849
- Look. I could assure you.

684
00:45:44.884 --> 00:45:47.346
there's nothing to
be concerned about.

685
00:45:47.381 --> 00:45:51.482
I need to make sure I take
complete preliminary notes.

686
00:45:51.517 --> 00:45:55.255
Please just help yourself
to some food or a drink.

687
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:56.388
I'll join you all shortly.

688
00:46:00.262 --> 00:46:02.427
- I think I need to be
alone for a little while.

689
00:46:35.594 --> 00:46:37.165
- I didn't know you smoked.

690
00:46:42.502 --> 00:46:43.336
- I don't.

691
00:46:44.539 --> 00:46:46.977
- Well. you know. if there ever
is a perfect time to start.

692
00:46:47.012 --> 00:46:49.474
and. you know. the doc is
knocking around in your head.

693
00:46:49.509 --> 00:46:52.213
maybe he can lock the door
to the nicotine addiction.

694
00:46:55.152 --> 00:46:57.251
- That was really
strange. you guys.

695
00:46:59.024 --> 00:47:00.353
- Yeah. you can say that again.

696
00:47:00.388 --> 00:47:05.391
- No. I mean. even Dr. Pretorius
seemed caught off guard.

697
00:47:08.099 --> 00:47:10.066
- What I tell you guys
about this black magic?

698
00:47:10.101 --> 00:47:11.562
It's sick shit.

699
00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:25.081
- Somebody wake me up!

700
00:47:25.116 --> 00:47:30.119
No!

701
00:47:40.692 --> 00:47:42.593
- Hey there.
sleeping beauty.

702
00:47:42.628 --> 00:47:43.968
- Hey.

703
00:47:44.003 --> 00:47:46.300
- How you feeling
there. Theo. all right?

704
00:47:46.335 --> 00:47:48.170
- Yeah. I'm all right.

705
00:47:49.536 --> 00:47:50.469
I just got this funk.

706
00:47:52.209 --> 00:47:54.011
I can't shake it. Doc.

707
00:47:55.179 --> 00:47:56.706
- Hey. take a sip
of this. my friend.

708
00:47:56.741 --> 00:47:58.609
It'll make it feel
a whole lot better.

709
00:47:58.644 --> 00:48:00.446
- Try not to get
too sloshed tonight.

710
00:48:00.481 --> 00:48:02.679
I want accurate
notes in the morning.

711
00:48:02.714 --> 00:48:05.385
- What are you expecting
us to experience tonight?

712
00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.124
- No expectations.
but with any luck.

713
00:48:08.159 --> 00:48:11.457
a few moments into
your REM cycle.

714
00:48:11.492 --> 00:48:14.229
you'll experience a textbook
case of sleep paralysis.

715
00:48:16.464 --> 00:48:18.068
- But what if we don't?

716
00:48:18.103 --> 00:48:22.600
- If you don't. well. my
study's off to a rough start.

717
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:28.144
- Hey. Doc. we still get
our money though. right?

718
00:48:28.179 --> 00:48:30.377
- Oh. yes. you'll be
a part of the study

719
00:48:30.412 --> 00:48:34.447
for the full seven days until
Victor returns with your keys.

720
00:48:34.482 --> 00:48:36.383
- But you could call him
though. couldn't you?

721
00:48:36.418 --> 00:48:38.418
- Of course. any time.

722
00:48:38.453 --> 00:48:40.585
- Not before you
unfuck my head. man.

723
00:48:42.457 --> 00:48:45.722
- All right. guys. so
what are we drinking to?

724
00:48:45.757 --> 00:48:47.526
- To progress!

725
00:48:47.561 --> 00:48:49.594
- Progress.

726
00:48:49.629 --> 00:48:50.562
- Progress.

727
00:48:50.597 --> 00:48:52.234
- Woo!

728
00:50:07.542 --> 00:50:09.542
- A beautiful discovery.

729
00:53:04.686 --> 00:53:06.719
- Somebody wake me up!

730
00:53:24.475 --> 00:53:26.376
- Theo!
- Theo?

731
00:53:26.411 --> 00:53:27.410
Theo?
- Theo!

732
00:53:28.611 --> 00:53:30.479
- Theo!
- Theo!

733
00:53:30.514 --> 00:53:31.909
- Theo!
- Theo!

734
00:53:31.944 --> 00:53:34.780
- Oh. god.
Dr. Pretorius!

735
00:53:34.815 --> 00:53:36.485
- Dr. Pretorius!

736
00:53:37.884 --> 00:53:39.356
- What's all this commotion?

737
00:53:39.391 --> 00:53:40.852
- We can't find Theo.

738
00:53:41.822 --> 00:53:42.953
- Well. what do you mean?

739
00:53:42.988 --> 00:53:44.856
- Look around.
Doc. he ain't here.

740
00:53:44.891 --> 00:53:46.330
- Well. he didn't
just disappear.

741
00:53:46.365 --> 00:53:47.760
- Last night. we all heard him.

742
00:53:47.795 --> 00:53:48.992
It was awful.

743
00:53:49.027 --> 00:53:49.861
- It was like-

744
00:53:49.896 --> 00:53:50.928
- Last night?

745
00:53:50.963 --> 00:53:52.798
- Because we all saw it.

746
00:53:52.833 --> 00:53:54.503
- Saw what?

747
00:53:54.538 --> 00:53:55.999
Oh. did you experience
the sleep paralysis?

748
00:53:56.034 --> 00:53:57.638
- Yeah. you better
fucking believe we did.

749
00:53:57.673 --> 00:53:59.706
- We all did. we all
saw the exact same thing

750
00:53:59.741 --> 00:54:00.874
and we all heard-

751
00:54:00.909 --> 00:54:01.807
- You trying to tell me you
didn't hear nothing. Doc?

752
00:54:01.842 --> 00:54:02.742
- What?

753
00:54:02.777 --> 00:54:04.073
- Theo!

754
00:54:04.108 --> 00:54:05.910
He was screaming for
someone to help him.

755
00:54:05.945 --> 00:54:06.911
and now he's missing.

756
00:54:06.946 --> 00:54:08.319
- What is happening?

757
00:54:08.354 --> 00:54:09.782
- Look. let's just
all calm down.

758
00:54:09.817 --> 00:54:11.883
Let's go back to
the operations room.

759
00:54:13.821 --> 00:54:15.755
You say you all
heard this as well?

760
00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:19.330
- Yes!

761
00:54:19.365 --> 00:54:22.366
- Doctor. we have to find Theo.

762
00:54:22.401 --> 00:54:23.466
- He'll turn up.

763
00:54:29.375 --> 00:54:33.740
- The screams were so loud.

764
00:54:35.139 --> 00:54:37.480
They echo through the halls.

765
00:54:37.515 --> 00:54:40.681
I mean. as long as I've lived.

766
00:54:40.716 --> 00:54:42.914
I've never heard anything
like that before.

767
00:54:44.621 --> 00:54:46.324
- You all had the
same experience?

768
00:54:47.492 --> 00:54:49.492
- Right down to what
the thing looked like.

769
00:54:49.527 --> 00:54:51.626
- Imagine sharing
a bad hair day.

770
00:54:51.661 --> 00:54:52.495
- Fascinating.

771
00:54:53.698 --> 00:54:56.367
Who was the first to share
their occurrence this morning?

772
00:54:57.766 --> 00:54:59.931
- Wanda and I woke up at
nearly the exact same time.

773
00:55:00.934 --> 00:55:01.833
- And then we woke up Porter

774
00:55:01.869 --> 00:55:03.869
once we realized that
Theo was missing.

775
00:55:05.543 --> 00:55:07.378
- You informed Wanda
of your experience?

776
00:55:07.413 --> 00:55:08.610
- We both knew.

777
00:55:08.645 --> 00:55:11.448
- But who shared
the details first?

778
00:55:11.483 --> 00:55:12.845
- I'm not sure.

779
00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:13.681
Why?

780
00:55:18.688 --> 00:55:23.691
- Have you heard of a
phenomenon forwalli ado?

781
00:55:24.826 --> 00:55:27.860
- Doctor. last night.
Theo was screaming

782
00:55:27.895 --> 00:55:31.094
for someone to help him
and now he's missing.

783
00:55:32.933 --> 00:55:35.164
- What do you think
happened to him?

784
00:55:35.199 --> 00:55:36.638
- I don't think we know.

785
00:55:36.673 --> 00:55:39.872
but shouldn't you
be more concerned?

786
00:55:39.907 --> 00:55:42.710
- I'm very concerned
with his wellbeing.

787
00:55:42.745 --> 00:55:44.679
as I am of all of you.

788
00:55:44.714 --> 00:55:46.978
You've all just experienced
for the first time

789
00:55:47.013 --> 00:55:49.486
what it's like to live
with a sleep disorder.

790
00:55:50.687 --> 00:55:54.656
This can be extremely
distressing for some.

791
00:55:56.528 --> 00:55:59.826
My guess is that Theo
needed to be alone

792
00:55:59.861 --> 00:56:05.029
after such trauma.
or most regrettably.

793
00:56:06.032 --> 00:56:08.538
he took himself home on
the bus he came in on.

794
00:56:09.739 --> 00:56:11.706
- That doesn't sound so
regrettable to me. Doc.

795
00:56:11.741 --> 00:56:16.172
- Well. without
proper treatment.

796
00:56:16.207 --> 00:56:20.616
poor Theo may suffer from a
debilitating sleep disorder

797
00:56:20.651 --> 00:56:21.485
from here on.

798
00:56:23.049 --> 00:56:25.181
- You mean without
the hypnotherapy?

799
00:56:25.216 --> 00:56:26.952
- It's entirely possible.

800
00:56:26.987 --> 00:56:28.756
It's also equally as possible

801
00:56:28.791 --> 00:56:31.858
that last night was
just a coincidence

802
00:56:31.893 --> 00:56:34.927
and had nothing to do with
the study in the first place.

803
00:56:37.503 --> 00:56:40.867
A sample size such as this

804
00:56:43.234 --> 00:56:44.706
really tells us nothing.

805
00:56:50.648 --> 00:56:51.944
- Oh. gosh.

806
00:56:51.979 --> 00:56:53.979
I just feel so paranoid.

807
00:57:00.053 --> 00:57:03.087
- You know. what
really worries me

808
00:57:03.122 --> 00:57:04.924
is you hear stories like this.

809
00:57:04.959 --> 00:57:08.862
about people being
stuck together.

810
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:14.967
sharing the same paranoia
like mass hysteria.

811
00:57:18.544 --> 00:57:20.478
Dyatlov's Pass and shit.

812
00:57:27.883 --> 00:57:31.654
I used to watch those
YouTube channels.

813
00:57:31.689 --> 00:57:35.152
like five unsolved mysteries

814
00:57:35.187 --> 00:57:36.725
that keep you up late at night

815
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.894
about families being
away at a cabin

816
00:57:40.929 --> 00:57:44.293
and tearing each other apart
for seemingly no reason at all.

817
00:57:44.328 --> 00:57:45.899
And if I'm being honest.

818
00:57:47.265 --> 00:57:48.968
I'm really starting
to get scared.

819
00:57:56.681 --> 00:57:58.813
- My ex. Glen.

820
00:58:01.653 --> 00:58:03.983
it's like he woke up one day.

821
00:58:04.018 --> 00:58:08.251
his entire mood and
outlook had shifted.

822
00:58:13.929 --> 00:58:15.291
It was like he was a new person

823
00:58:15.326 --> 00:58:18.602
with a clear sense
of what he wanted.

824
00:58:20.364 --> 00:58:22.870
And he had come to
the realization that

825
00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:26.676
that wasn't a life with me.

826
00:58:30.979 --> 00:58:32.847
I couldn't understand
how something like that

827
00:58:32.882 --> 00:58:36.917
could happen so quickly.

828
00:58:41.088 --> 00:58:43.286
Now I think I'm
starting to understand.

829
00:58:48.392 --> 00:58:49.996
What's the verdict?

830
00:58:58.171 --> 00:58:59.269
- No.

831
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:32.907
- You're all rather quiet.

832
00:59:36.374 --> 00:59:39.111
Don't tell me you're all still
worried about last night?

833
00:59:41.951 --> 00:59:44.182
Come on. what
should we drink to?

834
00:59:44.217 --> 00:59:45.150
- How about to Theo?

835
00:59:48.694 --> 00:59:53.059
- I told you that he probably
left early this morning

836
00:59:53.094 --> 00:59:55.061
and it turns out I was right.

837
00:59:57.461 --> 01:00:01.166
Now. why don't we
drink to success?

838
01:00:02.268 --> 01:00:03.773
- How do you figure
success. Doc?

839
01:00:05.337 --> 01:00:08.140
- Well. you're all
still here. aren't you?

840
01:00:09.308 --> 01:00:12.782
And last night went
to be as expected.

841
01:00:14.115 --> 01:00:18.084
Even a small bit of
success. is still a success.

842
01:00:18.119 --> 01:00:22.319
- Doctor. how do you know that
Theo left on his own accord?

843
01:00:23.993 --> 01:00:24.827
- Come with me.

844
01:00:44.343 --> 01:00:47.113
Now. I would suggest that
you all get in the habit

845
01:00:47.148 --> 01:00:50.050
of fully reading your
contracts before signing them.

846
01:00:52.186 --> 01:00:54.252
- So you saw what
happened last night.

847
01:00:54.287 --> 01:00:56.859
- I reviewed it after
interviewing the three of you.

848
01:00:57.994 --> 01:01:00.225
- Hey. Doc. we
should probably talk

849
01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.766
about what you gonna
do with that footage.

850
01:01:02.801 --> 01:01:05.868
- No. don't worry. your
extracurricular activities

851
01:01:05.903 --> 01:01:07.232
have already been erased.

852
01:01:08.433 --> 01:01:09.267
Please.

853
01:01:20.016 --> 01:01:20.817
- Fuck.

854
01:01:20.852 --> 01:01:22.280
- Where is he going?

855
01:01:22.315 --> 01:01:24.216
- I only have five cameras.

856
01:01:24.251 --> 01:01:25.987
and this one's
facing the entrance.

857
01:01:29.025 --> 01:01:30.189
- This is weird.

858
01:01:31.325 --> 01:01:33.896
I don't think he'd just
get up and leave like that.

859
01:01:35.097 --> 01:01:37.097
We should go to the police.

860
01:01:37.132 --> 01:01:39.495
- We can. but I believe
they would require

861
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:43.037
more than 48 hours before
doing much about it.

862
01:01:43.072 --> 01:01:44.841
But if it would make
you feel a lot better.

863
01:02:13.201 --> 01:02:15.872
- I believe the sign says girls.

864
01:02:17.271 --> 01:02:20.844
- Yeah. I'm not into the
whole gender identity thing.

865
01:02:23.442 --> 01:02:24.408
So how you feeling?

866
01:02:27.314 --> 01:02:28.346
- About?

867
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.118
- Everything that's
been going on?

868
01:02:32.957 --> 01:02:34.550
- I'm just trying
to stay rational.

869
01:02:36.323 --> 01:02:37.256
- Yeah.

870
01:02:38.622 --> 01:02:39.962
I swear. if another
person makes a run for it

871
01:02:39.997 --> 01:02:42.030
in the wee hours of the morning.

872
01:02:42.065 --> 01:02:44.329
I'm going full
Rambo on this bitch.

873
01:02:44.364 --> 01:02:45.396
- Hmm.

874
01:02:46.597 --> 01:02:47.431
Likewise.

875
01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.218
- No. please.

876
01:05:21.587 --> 01:05:24.687
No. please. somebody
help me. please!

877
01:05:32.301 --> 01:05:33.135
Please!

878
01:06:06.104 --> 01:06:07.565
- Dr. Pretorius?

879
01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.666
- No way this is
fucking happening.

880
01:06:09.701 --> 01:06:11.437
- Dr. Pretorius!

881
01:06:11.472 --> 01:06:13.472
- I think I'm actually
having an anxiety attack.

882
01:06:13.507 --> 01:06:14.339
- Dr. Pretorius!

883
01:06:14.375 --> 01:06:16.343
- Why don't we stop
fucking yelling?

884
01:06:16.378 --> 01:06:18.279
- What the fuck is
happening. you guys?

885
01:06:18.314 --> 01:06:19.214
- It's that thing.

886
01:06:21.713 --> 01:06:23.515
You know what I'm talking about.

887
01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:24.648
- God. she came in
through the door.

888
01:06:24.683 --> 01:06:26.452
She looked right at me.

889
01:06:26.487 --> 01:06:27.585
- Fuck this.

890
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.520
- Porter. where are you going?

891
01:06:28.555 --> 01:06:30.753
- To check the fucking cameras!

892
01:06:39.137 --> 01:06:41.236
All right. let's figure
out how to rewind.

893
01:06:43.339 --> 01:06:45.768
Menu. playback.

894
01:06:49.213 --> 01:06:50.047
- There!

895
01:06:57.683 --> 01:06:59.419
- What's he doing?

896
01:06:59.454 --> 01:07:00.585
- Sleep walking.

897
01:07:01.721 --> 01:07:04.424
- So what we heard last
night was what. a nightmare?

898
01:07:04.459 --> 01:07:06.690
But Dr. Pretorius did walk
up outta here like Theo!

899
01:07:06.725 --> 01:07:08.824
I mean. that's insane!

900
01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:10.661
- Fuck this. I'm out!

901
01:07:12.302 --> 01:07:13.136
- Wait!

902
01:07:15.866 --> 01:07:17.536
Where are you going?

903
01:07:17.571 --> 01:07:20.242
- Home. to a hospital.
anywhere but fucking here.

904
01:07:20.277 --> 01:07:21.606
- Good idea.

905
01:07:21.641 --> 01:07:23.707
- Wait. just wait a minute!

906
01:07:23.742 --> 01:07:25.346
- For what?

907
01:07:25.381 --> 01:07:27.579
- We have to
find the doctor and Theo.

908
01:07:27.614 --> 01:07:29.647
- Fuck that. I say
we call the police

909
01:07:29.682 --> 01:07:30.781
and let them handle it.

910
01:07:30.817 --> 01:07:33.255
And as far as us. I say we
find the nearest bus stop

911
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:35.389
and get the fuck outta here
until Vincent or Victor.

912
01:07:35.424 --> 01:07:36.819
or whatever the fuck
his name is comes back!

913
01:07:36.854 --> 01:07:38.656
- I'm not so sure
that's gonna work.

914
01:07:40.759 --> 01:07:43.562
Something's happened
to us. you guys.

915
01:07:43.597 --> 01:07:46.202
- Yeah. yeah.
something did happen.

916
01:07:46.237 --> 01:07:48.204
We're being "Punk'D." or worse.

917
01:07:48.239 --> 01:07:50.470
we're all actually fucking
disappearing one by one.

918
01:07:50.505 --> 01:07:52.208
- Then we have to do something!

919
01:07:55.213 --> 01:07:56.674
- Great plan. Napoleon.

920
01:07:56.709 --> 01:07:57.807
- Porter!

921
01:07:57.842 --> 01:07:59.314
- You coming?

922
01:07:59.349 --> 01:08:01.151
- Maybe we're overreacting.

923
01:08:01.186 --> 01:08:03.813
- Look. I'd rather
overreact than under react

924
01:08:03.848 --> 01:08:06.618
when it comes to people
fucking disappearing.

925
01:08:06.653 --> 01:08:09.621
- Let's just think
about this. okay?

926
01:08:09.656 --> 01:08:12.393
We're all having
these dreams. right?

927
01:08:12.428 --> 01:08:14.791
And we know that something's
happening to the person

928
01:08:14.826 --> 01:08:15.792
that gets up and leaves in
the middle of the night.

929
01:08:15.827 --> 01:08:17.629
- Fuck this. fuck this.

930
01:08:17.664 --> 01:08:18.795
- Porter!
- Bye. I'm out.

931
01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:19.697
- Wait. no. wait!
- I'm fucking out!

932
01:08:19.732 --> 01:08:20.764
- Porter!

933
01:08:29.379 --> 01:08:30.840
- Well. go on.

934
01:08:32.679 --> 01:08:33.942
- With what?

935
01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:35.614
- Where you were
going with that.

936
01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.783
- I don't know.

937
01:08:40.952 --> 01:08:43.589
- What's the real reason you
don't wanna leave. Wanda?

938
01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:46.790
- How do you know that isn't?

939
01:08:46.825 --> 01:08:48.825
- You wear your
thoughts on your sleeve.

940
01:08:50.763 --> 01:08:52.301
- I got nowhere else to go.

941
01:08:56.274 --> 01:08:58.604
- Maybe we can find his
assistant's phone number

942
01:08:58.639 --> 01:09:00.573
or something. get
him to help us?

943
01:09:01.807 --> 01:09:03.378
- Yeah. there's a plan. come on.

944
01:09:03.413 --> 01:09:04.511
- Okay. okay.

945
01:09:27.272 --> 01:09:29.272
- Try it on her. you
can hear her heart.

946
01:09:32.607 --> 01:09:33.705
All right. just a sec.

947
01:09:35.808 --> 01:09:36.807
Hello.

948
01:09:36.842 --> 01:09:37.676
- Victor!

949
01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.383
This is Wanda. Wanda Fulcia.

950
01:09:41.418 --> 01:09:42.681
- Who?

951
01:09:42.716 --> 01:09:45.717
- Wanda from the sleep study.

952
01:09:45.752 --> 01:09:49.853
- Oh. right.
Wanda from the sleep study.

953
01:09:50.823 --> 01:09:54.429
- We really need you
to come back here.

954
01:09:55.927 --> 01:09:57.663
Something strange has happened.

955
01:09:57.698 --> 01:09:59.302
Can you get over here quick?

956
01:10:00.767 --> 01:10:02.998
- You know. I could lose my
job for something like that.

957
01:10:05.442 --> 01:10:07.541
You read your contract. right?

958
01:10:07.576 --> 01:10:11.446
- Listen. Theo
went missing. okay?

959
01:10:11.481 --> 01:10:16.044
Porter just left and we
can't find Dr. Pretorius.

960
01:10:16.079 --> 01:10:18.354
We need you to get over here.

961
01:10:18.389 --> 01:10:19.553
Will you please?

962
01:10:19.588 --> 01:10:21.049
- Look. put the
doctor on the phone.

963
01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:23.051
- He's missing. okay?

964
01:10:23.086 --> 01:10:23.920
He's not here.

965
01:10:28.795 --> 01:10:29.827
- Fuck!

966
01:10:32.403 --> 01:10:34.964
Yeah. all right. I'll
see what I can do.

967
01:10:34.999 --> 01:10:37.307
- Thank you. thank you so much.

968
01:10:37.342 --> 01:10:38.770
Okay. okay. see you soon.

969
01:10:38.805 --> 01:10:39.804
Thank you.

970
01:11:12.839 --> 01:11:13.772
- Anything?

971
01:11:14.973 --> 01:11:16.038
- No. not really.

972
01:11:25.522 --> 01:11:26.653
Huh?

973
01:11:26.688 --> 01:11:27.522
- What?

974
01:11:30.461 --> 01:11:32.087
- It's an article.

975
01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:32.956
- So?

976
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:37.928
- Nightmares suspected in
bed deaths of 18 Laotians.

977
01:11:39.536 --> 01:11:41.965
- Shut your fucking mouth.
what the fuck is this?

978
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.472
- It's from 1981.

979
01:11:44.904 --> 01:11:47.443
"The Department of Health
and Human Services in Atlanta

980
01:11:47.478 --> 01:11:50.479
"is conducting an intensive
inquiry into the manner

981
01:11:50.514 --> 01:11:54.912
"in which 18 apparently
healthy Laotian refugees died

982
01:11:54.947 --> 01:11:56.914
"mysteriously in their sleep."

983
01:11:56.949 --> 01:11:59.983
- Why the fuck is this
in his fucking notebook?

984
01:12:00.018 --> 01:12:00.823
- I'm not sure.

985
01:12:21.842 --> 01:12:24.843
The doctor was really
obsessed with the details

986
01:12:24.878 --> 01:12:26.977
of the sleep
paralysis experience.

987
01:12:28.552 --> 01:12:30.585
- It's truly fascinating.

988
01:12:31.819 --> 01:12:33.588
I'd probably inquire
more about that

989
01:12:33.623 --> 01:12:36.591
if I wasn't so afraid
for my life right now.

990
01:12:36.626 --> 01:12:38.923
- Seriously. he
goes on for pages

991
01:12:38.958 --> 01:12:40.925
about The Hag.

992
01:12:42.027 --> 01:12:45.864
I mean. he's got quotes.
and like this one.

993
01:12:47.967 --> 01:12:49.934
"I remember hearing
a roaring sound

994
01:12:49.969 --> 01:12:51.573
"then seeing a shadowy figure

995
01:12:51.608 --> 01:12:53.608
"standing in the
middle of my room.

996
01:12:53.643 --> 01:12:56.743
"either saying my name and
laughing or just watching me.

997
01:12:57.878 --> 01:12:59.042
"It was so real.

998
01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:03.013
"I refused to sleep as a
child. but when I told my mom.

999
01:13:03.048 --> 01:13:04.652
"she didn't take me seriously

1000
01:13:06.084 --> 01:13:07.886
"until it started chasing me.

1001
01:13:09.153 --> 01:13:11.153
"I would wake up and
it was still there.

1002
01:13:12.563 --> 01:13:14.431
"It started chasing
me around my room."

1003
01:13:15.995 --> 01:13:19.634
Chester Fair. 10/22/20.

1004
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:21.031
- Wanda. what the fuck?

1005
01:13:21.066 --> 01:13:22.901
Chester Fair.

1006
01:13:22.936 --> 01:13:24.067
Victor Fair.

1007
01:13:24.102 --> 01:13:25.574
Is that like his brother?

1008
01:13:26.907 --> 01:13:28.841
- Wanda. what
difference does it make?

1009
01:13:28.876 --> 01:13:31.877
Look. I'm less interested
in what's actually happening

1010
01:13:31.912 --> 01:13:33.978
and more interested in
what's making it happen.

1011
01:13:34.013 --> 01:13:36.079
Is there a way to stop it?

1012
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:40.622
- I don't know.

1013
01:14:50.221 --> 01:14:51.055
- Hello?

1014
01:14:52.927 --> 01:14:53.761
Wanda?

1015
01:14:56.128 --> 01:14:56.962
Hello?

1016
01:15:00.099 --> 01:15:01.065
Doctor?

1017
01:15:14.212 --> 01:15:17.752
- God. it's fucking dark.

1018
01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.250
Maybe we should've gone. too.

1019
01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:24.319
- I think that would've
been a mistake.

1020
01:15:26.796 --> 01:15:28.092
- Well. yeah. how do you know?

1021
01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.766
- Just a gut feeling.

1022
01:15:31.801 --> 01:15:34.131
- I wonder where Porter
is right about. oh. Wanda!

1023
01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.265
- What?

1024
01:15:38.203 --> 01:15:39.268
What?
- The doctor!

1025
01:15:39.303 --> 01:15:40.841
I just saw him and Theo!

1026
01:15:40.876 --> 01:15:41.776
- Are you sure?

1027
01:15:41.811 --> 01:15:42.876
- I looked right at them!

1028
01:15:42.911 --> 01:15:44.141
Doctor. Theo!

1029
01:15:45.111 --> 01:15:47.683
- Shit. shit. my bad. my bad.

1030
01:15:50.116 --> 01:15:52.853
- Can't you cough or clear
your throat or something

1031
01:15:52.888 --> 01:15:53.887
to let people know
you're coming?

1032
01:15:53.922 --> 01:15:55.086
- I'm not in the
mood. all right?

1033
01:15:55.121 --> 01:15:56.725
Did you guys find 'em or what?

1034
01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.793
- We just saw them!

1035
01:15:58.828 --> 01:15:59.387
- You did?

1036
01:15:59.422 --> 01:16:00.828
- Well. I didn't.

1037
01:16:00.863 --> 01:16:02.291
- I swear I saw them
walking down the hall!

1038
01:16:02.326 --> 01:16:03.193
- Just now?

1039
01:16:03.228 --> 01:16:04.931
- Yes. goddamn it!

1040
01:16:04.966 --> 01:16:06.130
- Well. fuck. they
didn't go this way.

1041
01:16:06.165 --> 01:16:07.197
I would've saw 'em.

1042
01:16:08.101 --> 01:16:10.233
- What are you doing back here?

1043
01:16:10.268 --> 01:16:13.236
- Look. the bus station comes
around once a day. all right.

1044
01:16:13.271 --> 01:16:15.645
and I just fucking missed it.

1045
01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.713
And this place is
like a ghost town.

1046
01:16:17.748 --> 01:16:20.617
Did you guys know the police
station closes on the weekends?

1047
01:16:21.818 --> 01:16:24.214
- But I did manage to
flag down a patrol car

1048
01:16:24.249 --> 01:16:25.952
from a few towns over.

1049
01:16:25.987 --> 01:16:28.020
- And what did they say?

1050
01:16:28.055 --> 01:16:30.858
- Not much. other than that
they'll keep an eye out

1051
01:16:30.893 --> 01:16:31.859
for the both of them

1052
01:16:31.894 --> 01:16:35.126
and report it as a
potential missing persons.

1053
01:16:35.161 --> 01:16:36.094
- That's it?

1054
01:16:36.129 --> 01:16:37.161
- Great.

1055
01:16:38.131 --> 01:16:41.935
- So did you guys
make any dinner?

1056
01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:44.135
I'm starving.

1057
01:16:47.107 --> 01:16:51.142
No?

1058
01:16:52.277 --> 01:16:55.751
So what's the plan. Napoleon?

1059
01:16:57.887 --> 01:16:58.721
- Me?

1060
01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:00.789
- Yeah. you.

1061
01:17:00.824 --> 01:17:02.417
I mean. you're the
only person here

1062
01:17:02.452 --> 01:17:04.727
trying to find a
solution and. well.

1063
01:17:04.762 --> 01:17:06.355
my plan for the bus doesn't
pan out til the morning.

1064
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:07.796
so let's hear it.

1065
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:21.073
- Well. the doctor had
documented extremely thoroughly

1066
01:17:21.944 --> 01:17:23.207
how to perform the hypnosis.

1067
01:17:25.915 --> 01:17:26.749
- So?

1068
01:17:29.446 --> 01:17:33.415
- So. Margo has some experience
with that kind of stuff.

1069
01:17:36.057 --> 01:17:40.290
- Whoa. I only performed tarot
card readings as a hobby.

1070
01:17:40.325 --> 01:17:43.733
- I mean. but we could try
to perform the hypnosis

1071
01:17:43.768 --> 01:17:44.734
on one of us.

1072
01:17:47.497 --> 01:17:48.430
- I just don't think I can-

1073
01:17:48.465 --> 01:17:50.036
- Yeah. that's out.

1074
01:17:51.006 --> 01:17:52.038
Any other ideas?

1075
01:17:54.207 --> 01:17:55.140
No?
- No.

1076
01:17:55.175 --> 01:17:58.814
- Well. I guess we'll
just never sleep again.

1077
01:17:58.849 --> 01:18:00.981
I mean. how hard
could that be. right?

1078
01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:06.448
- Yeah. I mean. what about that?

1079
01:18:06.483 --> 01:18:10.155
Right. two of us stay
up. watch the other one.

1080
01:18:11.356 --> 01:18:13.895
I mean that way if something
weird starts happening.

1081
01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:15.226
we can wake the person up.

1082
01:18:17.967 --> 01:18:20.231
At least that way we'll
know what's going on.

1083
01:18:22.334 --> 01:18:25.203
- All right. Margo. call it.

1084
01:18:27.042 --> 01:18:27.876
- Heads.

1085
01:18:30.881 --> 01:18:31.506
- Heads.

1086
01:18:32.442 --> 01:18:34.883
Okay. ladies. you better
brew up some coffee.

1087
01:18:34.918 --> 01:18:36.280
It's gonna be a long night.

1088
01:18:52.199 --> 01:18:53.869
- Jesus Christ.

1089
01:18:53.904 --> 01:18:55.134
- What?

1090
01:18:59.404 --> 01:19:01.371
- I made it to the
end of his journal.

1091
01:19:02.946 --> 01:19:06.046
- And?

1092
01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:09.852
- And all it says is.

1093
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:15.990
"It no longer appears to be a
matter of inward projection.

1094
01:19:18.159 --> 01:19:21.556
"The door was
opened and something

1095
01:19:23.131 --> 01:19:24.361
"has gotten outside."

1096
01:19:26.266 --> 01:19:31.269
- What the fuck does that mean?

1097
01:20:20.925 --> 01:20:25.928
- Goddamn. I am so tired.

1098
01:20:28.592 --> 01:20:31.428
- Yeah. it does look
nice. doesn't it?

1099
01:20:33.531 --> 01:20:35.432
Ugh. I can't wait for
the morning to come

1100
01:20:35.467 --> 01:20:37.302
and for Porter to wake up

1101
01:20:37.337 --> 01:20:39.469
and we can all laugh
about that one time

1102
01:20:39.504 --> 01:20:41.075
we almost went crazy.

1103
01:20:43.046 --> 01:20:44.078
- Hilarious.

1104
01:20:48.513 --> 01:20:50.986
I'm gonna go splash
some water on my face.

1105
01:20:56.587 --> 01:20:58.191
Hey. watch him.

1106
01:21:05.002 --> 01:21:07.398
- Oh. hey. can you
make some more coffee?

1107
01:21:08.533 --> 01:21:09.367
- On it.

1108
01:21:35.461 --> 01:21:37.329
- Somebody?

1109
01:22:23.476 --> 01:22:25.773
- Oh shit. oh my god.

1110
01:22:25.808 --> 01:22:27.115
Porter. wait!

1111
01:22:29.581 --> 01:22:30.613
Porter. Porter!

1112
01:22:35.587 --> 01:22:36.751
Porter!

1113
01:22:36.786 --> 01:22:38.390
- Margo.
what are you doing?

1114
01:22:38.425 --> 01:22:39.457
- He's gone!
- What?

1115
01:22:39.492 --> 01:22:41.756
- He's gone!
- Oh my god!

1116
01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:42.790
Margo!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

1117
01:22:42.825 --> 01:22:44.429
- What the fuck happened?

1118
01:22:44.464 --> 01:22:46.464
- I fell asleep.

1119
01:22:46.499 --> 01:22:47.365
- Ah. fuck.

1120
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.697
Okay. you have to
listen to me. all right?

1121
01:22:48.732 --> 01:22:50.105
- No.

1122
01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:52.107
- Yes. Margo. you
have to listen to me!

1123
01:22:52.142 --> 01:22:53.570
Okay?

1124
01:22:53.605 --> 01:22:56.771
We're gonna fix this.
we're gonna fix this. okay?

1125
01:22:56.806 --> 01:22:58.443
All right. come on.
we're gonna do this.

1126
01:22:58.478 --> 01:23:00.610
it's gonna be okay.
it's gonna be okay.

1127
01:23:02.251 --> 01:23:03.712
- No. I
don't wanna do it.

1128
01:23:03.747 --> 01:23:05.648
- You have
to sit down. okay?

1129
01:23:05.683 --> 01:23:06.484
- I don't wanna!

1130
01:23:06.519 --> 01:23:07.617
- Look at me!

1131
01:23:07.652 --> 01:23:09.817
- No. I don't wanna die!

1132
01:23:09.852 --> 01:23:11.588
- You're not gonna die.

1133
01:23:11.623 --> 01:23:13.590
Margo. you need to calm down.

1134
01:23:13.625 --> 01:23:16.758
You need to calm
down and relax. okay?

1135
01:23:16.793 --> 01:23:18.265
Can you just relax?

1136
01:23:19.468 --> 01:23:22.401
Okay. I want you to take a deep
breath. sit back and relax.

1137
01:23:24.801 --> 01:23:25.800
Can you trust me?

1138
01:23:27.441 --> 01:23:29.210
Margo. do you trust me?

1139
01:23:29.245 --> 01:23:29.837
- Mm-hmm .

1140
01:23:29.872 --> 01:23:31.212
- Okay.

1141
01:23:48.825 --> 01:23:51.661
Sit back. relax.

1142
01:24:05.545 --> 01:24:08.777
Now. I want you to
imagine a staircase.

1143
01:24:09.879 --> 01:24:13.617
10 wide safe stairs down.

1144
01:24:15.687 --> 01:24:17.753
You're standing at the
top of those stairs.

1145
01:24:18.888 --> 01:24:20.855
I need you to take
one step down.

1146
01:24:25.202 --> 01:24:27.103
10. nine. eight. seven.

1147
01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:33.802
six. five. four.

1148
01:24:33.837 --> 01:24:36.607
three. two. one.

1149
01:24:44.221 --> 01:24:47.750
Deeper. deeper. relaxed.

1150
01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.899
Now listen to me. Margo.

1151
01:25:04.934 --> 01:25:07.737
We opened ourselves up
to the forces around us.

1152
01:25:07.772 --> 01:25:10.443
We opened that door
and when you come back.

1153
01:25:10.478 --> 01:25:12.247
you're gonna have
that door closed.

1154
01:25:14.647 --> 01:25:16.845
When you come back. you're
gonna be less perceptive

1155
01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.783
to things. less perceptive
than you've ever been.

1156
01:25:20.818 --> 01:25:23.753
But you're gonna come back
with that door closed.

1157
01:25:23.788 --> 01:25:24.952
Listen to me. Margo.

1158
01:25:24.987 --> 01:25:27.889
I need you to close that door.

1159
01:25:27.924 --> 01:25:29.231
- Somebody wake me up!

1160
01:25:42.378 --> 01:25:43.542
When I call you. Margo.

1161
01:25:43.577 --> 01:25:45.379
you're coming back
with that door closed!

1162
01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:49.614
Wake up. wake up. Margo!

1163
01:25:52.916 --> 01:25:54.289
Wake up!

1164
01:25:54.324 --> 01:25:55.752
- Somebody wake me up!
- Margo. wake up!

1165
01:25:55.787 --> 01:25:56.753
Margo!

1166
01:26:01.958 --> 01:26:03.925
- What the fuck
happened. oh my god!

1167
01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:06.268
Oh. Jesus Christ!

1168
01:26:06.303 --> 01:26:08.237
It felt like they were
in the fucking room!

1169
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:13.869
- Yeah. I don't know.

1170
01:26:15.906 --> 01:26:18.808
- Did it work. did it
work. did we get them back?

1171
01:26:18.843 --> 01:26:19.677
- I think so.

1172
01:26:22.583 --> 01:26:23.483
I think so.

1173
01:26:23.518 --> 01:26:25.584
- Jesus Christ. oh my god.

1174
01:26:27.049 --> 01:26:28.719
I need a fucking drink.

1175
01:26:31.427 --> 01:26:32.690
- Yeah.

1176
01:26:32.725 --> 01:26:33.757
Yeah.

1177
01:26:34.628 --> 01:26:35.462
Margo?

1178
01:26:37.697 --> 01:26:40.962
Yeah. yeah. why don't
you get some water

1179
01:26:40.997 --> 01:26:42.271
and we can talk?

1180
01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:49.872
Margo?

1181
01:27:05.890 --> 01:27:08.396
Somebody wake me up!

1182
01:27:08.431 --> 01:27:10.695
- Wake up.

1183
01:27:16.604 --> 01:27:17.537
- That was intense!

1184
01:27:17.572 --> 01:27:18.472
- Holy shit!

1185
01:27:18.507 --> 01:27:19.836
- How do you feel. all right?

1186
01:27:24.810 --> 01:27:26.414
