<i>Ginny. are you with me? Over.</i>

4
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.519
<i>Dear members of Lodsworth Sunday School.</i>

5
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.320
<i>thank you for your best wishes.</i>

6
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.160
<i>I am scribbling this in a tent
about 34 miles south of the Pole.</i>

7
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.880
<i>We may reach the Pole if we are lucky.</i>

8
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.120
<i>but at any time a wind could cause
the thin sea ice</i>

9
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.880
<i>on which we travel to break up. Stop.</i>

10
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.800
<i>For 11 years. Ginny. my wife. and I</i>

11
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.320
<i>have worked non-stop towards achieving
this circum-polar journey.</i>

12
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.960
<i>If we make it. I shall thank God</i>

13
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
<i>and realise that wonders never cease.</i>

14
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.560
Do you remember any words from the past?

15
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.960
The words from that time are gone.

16
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.360
because it was 50 years ago.

17
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.040
Give me a minute. one minute.

18
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.640
Everything has gone from my brain

19
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.080
don't know where these words went.

20
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.240
I don't blame you. I don't blame you.

21
00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.440
<i>Ginny. are you with me? Over.</i>

22
00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.400
On Easter Sunday. we came finally
to the top of the world.

23
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.360
I felt a wonderful. almost
physical. sense of relief.

24
00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:03.960
Five people have just walked in here
out of nowhere

25
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.840
with glasses of champagne.

26
01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.640
OK. for Observer magazine.
brackets. as requested.

27
01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.960
Summer 1982.

28
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.360
Floating south on an ice floe
in the Arctic Ocean.

29
01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.080
Where are we exactly?
I don't know. though I am navigator.

30
01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.000
- See you. Flo.
- See you. Ran.

31
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.920
- Did you add the gun?
- I've got the gun.

32
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.080
- He's not having it.
- OK.

33
01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:07.360
<i>Yeah. we beat the Norwegian
and the French bloke. over.</i>
