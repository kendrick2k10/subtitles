3
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.336
- So what you're telling me
Syfal.

4
00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.505
is that you haven't seen or
heard anything

5
00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.757
out of the ordinary lately?

6
00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:35.053
- (heavy breathing) Cayla
please.
I'm telling you the truth.

7
00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.973
I have not seen

8
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:41.935
anything.

9
00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:45.396
- And you are certain
you haven't seen anybody

10
00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:47.440
who may of looked odd uh?

11
00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:53.279
- No. no I haven't seen
anything out of the ordinary.

12
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.490
Cayla please!

13
00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:59.160
I don't want to die!

14
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.996
- Sil has seen this man in his
visions.

15
00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:04.666
so I know he's somewhere near.

16
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.043
And you were given a simple task

17
00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:10.839
of keeping your eye open
and nose to the ground.

18
00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:15.510
- I'm telling you the truth.
(footsteps crunching)

19
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.095
I haven't heard anything.

20
00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.140
- And I understand information

21
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.809
can be elusive at times. I get
that.

22
00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:27.355
But what I don't get is
why you would do business

23
00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:30.191
with the resistance.
those underground shits

24
00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:33.862
who think that they can
overthrow Sil. your new Lord!

25
00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.363
- Wait Cayla. please!

26
00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:37.031
(heavy breathing)
(Cayla laughs)

27
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.868
- You think we wouldn't find
out?

28
00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.036
- (groaning) Please!

29
00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:49.460
Cayla please. I was trying
to get information for you.

30
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.588
- Shut up you lying shit!

31
00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:54.007
(Syfal screams)
- I never liked you Syfal.

32
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.010
I would of slit your
throat a long time ago

33
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.597
but Sil found your influence
useful.

34
00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.433
All you were to do was
to keep an eye on things

35
00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:07.020
and report back and in return
your family stays safe.

36
00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.856
But what do you do?

37
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.859
Go and mingle with a
bunch of has been soldiers

38
00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.903
who think that they can
overthrow a God!

39
00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.070
Are you mad?

40
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.030
(thudding)

41
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.699
- Commander. he claims
to have seen two people

42
00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.201
running from the forest.

43
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.754
- So child. tell me what you
saw.

44
00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.422
- I was chasing down a weasel
for food

45
00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:37.300
when I saw two people run from
the forest.

46
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.927
- Did they run past you?

47
00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:41.137
- No. I was about 100 feet
behind a tree

48
00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.263
when I noticed them.

49
00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:46.226
- You said they ran out
of a forest. which forest?

50
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.269
- The Forest of SiKoran.

51
00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.395
(heavy drum beat)

52
00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.731
- Are you sure it was SiKoran?

53
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.565
- Yes

54
00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:56.611
- What did they look like?

55
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.572
- They were too far for me to
see.

56
00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.450
but one had on a black
jacket with a hood and he was

57
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.993
pulling someone else behind him.

58
00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:04.994
- Pulling?
- Yes!

59
00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.621
They were running pretty fast.

60
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.831
- Why were they being chased?

61
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.959
- I don't know. I didn't
see anyone behind them.

62
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.169
(forboding music)

63
00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.545
- You shit!

64
00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:15.588
All this time you knew!

65
00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:16.923
(sword whooshing)
- No. no.

66
00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.466
(splattering)

67
00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:21.636
(footsteps crunching)

68
00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:27.183
- (sighs) Get up!

69
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.563
(sword scraping)
Is that all you saw?

70
00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:33.648
- Yes Ms. Korvesian.

71
00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:44.367
- If you're lying to me
about any of this boy.

72
00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.161
I'll gut you and feed you to my
dogs.

73
00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:49.163
Do you understand?

74
00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:50.665
- Ye. Yes Ms. Korvesian.

75
00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.668
- Good. what's your name?

76
00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:54.585
- Orin.

77
00:04:54.585 --> 00:04:58.381
- Orin. you will take over
Syfal's role.

78
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:02.218
Find information on any
nearby resistance groups

79
00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.762
and what roles Syfal played in
them.

80
00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:08.099
You have two weeks to report
back to me.

81
00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.309
Is that clear?

82
00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.311
- Yes. yes thank you Ms.
Kovesian.

83
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.478
I won't let you down.

84
00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.690
- Of course. your life depends
on it.

85
00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:19.193
Go. begin!

86
00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.697
(footsteps crunching)

87
00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.699
- LyGon-Ril-Cylus-CorRegin!

88
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.908
(clashing)

89
00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:30.913
(electric zapping)
(grunting)

90
00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:34.876
- Ah.

91
00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.254
Hmm.

92
00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:41.007
(dramatic chord)

93
00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.888
(blade whooshing)
(squelching)

94
00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.389
- Ah!
(thuds)

95
00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.433
- All of you. listen up!

96
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:54.520
I am Cayla Korvesian.
commander of Sil's army.

97
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.899
And you are now under the
rule of the new republic.

98
00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.734
Sil's republic!

99
00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.320
Your days of freedom are over!

100
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.573
We decide what you can and
cannot have!

101
00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:09.243
We decide what you can and
cannot do!

102
00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:12.038
Your fate lies with us!

103
00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.664
Do you understand?

104
00:06:13.664 --> 00:06:14.665
- [All] Yes.

105
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:20.755
- I can see in your eyes you
want me dead.

106
00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:26.344
Well I want you dead too
but my king has plans.

107
00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:32.850
If any of you decide to
run off. I will personally

108
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.854
hunt you down and hang your
body parts from the trees.

109
00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:39.232
Do you understand?

110
00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.191
- [All] Yes.

111
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.568
We own you!

112
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.323
(footsteps)

113
00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.951
(upbeat music)

114
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.334
(door clicking)

115
00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:09.387
- What?

116
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:14.058
Monica. damn. can somebody
have a moment of peace?

117
00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:16.644
- What are you doing in a
bar this early in the morning

118
00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:18.229
during working hours?

119
00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.897
- For your information.
the owner let me in here

120
00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:22.567
and technically it's not open.

121
00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.819
Anyways. how the hell did you
find me?

122
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.487
- That's what I do!

123
00:07:26.487 --> 00:07:28.364
Anyway. where is your little
friend Eric?

124
00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:30.450
- I don't know. you're his boss

125
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.492
shouldn't you know?

126
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.582
and all I got was his
corny little voicemails.

127
00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:41.169
- Well there you go. maybe
he got lucky and overslept.

128
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.837
He did catch a nice one last
night.

129
00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.088
- Pff!

130
00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:46.591
- What. you jealous?

131
00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.635
- Ah no. it's just disgusting
how you guys

132
00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:51.179
see us as catches.

133
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:54.849
- Yes we see them as catches.

134
00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.434
I didn't say anything about you.

135
00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:58.769
- Oh shut up!

136
00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:01.481
If you hear from him.
tell him to see me pronto.

137
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.357
if he doesn't want to get
written up.

138
00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:05.193
Oh and also. Mills has some more
reports

139
00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.652
he needs him to do.

140
00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:07.528
- More work?

141
00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:11.032
He's already swamped with the
work you gave him yesterday.

142
00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.326
- Yeah well not much I can do.

143
00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.577
Mills is trying to save his ass

144
00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:15.703
by getting these reports ready

145
00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:17.246
for his presentation next month.

146
00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:19.582
- At Eric's expense?

147
00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:20.750
Unbelievable!

148
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.960
- Like I said. not much I can
do.

149
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.714
- Whatever. if you're done.
can I get back to work please?

150
00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:28.591
You're killing my vibe girl.

151
00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.092
- Vibe?

152
00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:31.844
You're not even suppose
to be listening to music

153
00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:34.222
on the job anyway. let alone in
a bar

154
00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.890
during working hours.

155
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.351
- Shoo. go so I can get my work
done.

156
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.852
- Shoo?

157
00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:41.270
You don't shoo me.

158
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.563
You think you can just wave your
hand

159
00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:44.815
and I'll go running away 'cause
you wanna listen to music

160
00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:46.234
and act like you're doing work?

161
00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:47.568
In a bar?

162
00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:50.071
(laughs) Who do you think you
are?

163
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:50.905
Prince?

164
00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:55.076
- Monica. you know I still
have that photo of you

165
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.702
back in your experimental
college days.

166
00:08:56.702 --> 00:09:01.249
- Oh. don't you dare Jimmy.
you better give me that photo.

167
00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.833
- Then you let me get back to
work

168
00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:05.127
and you leave Eric alone.

169
00:09:05.127 --> 00:09:07.004
- Fine. whatever!

170
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.131
But I'm still watching you.

171
00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:09.966
- Ew!

172
00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:12.093
- F-U Jimmy!

173
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.433
- Ooh. whoever she is Eric.
I hope she's worth it.

174
00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:22.019
(upbeat music)

175
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:26.274
(footsteps tapping)

176
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.860
(door clicking)

177
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.945
(electric zapping)

178
00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.655
- Must you keep throwing me
around?

179
00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.159
- What is. what is this. what is
this?

180
00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:40.329
- Good. the king's coming
through.

181
00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:43.332
(footsteps tapping)

182
00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:48.629
- What were those things

183
00:09:48.629 --> 00:09:51.257
that attacked me in the forest.
huh?

184
00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:53.926
Sofia. is that even your real
name?

185
00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.095
What is going on?

186
00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:59.140
(footsteps tapping)

187
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.600
- Things that attacked you in
the forest

188
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.435
are called The Children.

189
00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:05.062
mastered by an evil sorceress
named Sidra.

190
00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:07.481
Eric. I'll explain more later.

191
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.985
I just need you to be quiet and
be still.

192
00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.864
(bottle clinking)
Here. have a drink!

193
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:17.867
(footsteps tapping)

194
00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:29.837
- Sofia I...

195
00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:34.717
Oh. I'm sorry I didn't
realize you were changing.

196
00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:39.513
- Eric please. haven't
seen a woman before?

197
00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:42.350
- Well yeah of course. I
didn't want you to think--

198
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.852
- Alright. alright. stay where
you are

199
00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:47.188
if it makes you feel better.

200
00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:59.158
(fabric crinkling)

201
00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.661
(zipper zips)

202
00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:08.459
(footsteps tapping)

203
00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:09.585
- Wow. um.

204
00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:15.216
- Let me properly introduce
myself.

205
00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:19.762
My name is Sofia Hayden. army
commander of The City of Merc.

206
00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:22.056
your city Sire. and my duty

207
00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:23.849
is to help you get your memory
back.

208
00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:28.688
- My memory back. my memory is
just fine.

209
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:31.565
I clearly remember you
slapping me on stage.

210
00:11:31.565 --> 00:11:33.651
- That I did. but I'm here

211
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.903
to help you remember your true
self.

212
00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:37.238
- What?
- Please. sit down.

213
00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:38.239
Let me explain.

214
00:11:39.573 --> 00:11:41.450
- Uh. uh. oh on the floor?

215
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.452
- Yes Eric. on the floor.

216
00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.844
- How do you feel?

217
00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:03.139
- Well. I mean. I mean. how.
how am I supposed to feel?

218
00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.558
Okay. I am trapped in a theater
with you

219
00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.226
and all I want to do is go home.

220
00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:10.062
- Do you feel any comfort at
all?

221
00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:10.896
- No!

222
00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:13.941
- Are you feeling stronger?

223
00:12:13.941 --> 00:12:15.609
- No Sofia I don't!

224
00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:19.405
- Okay. let me explain.

225
00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.492
You are on a planet
named Ressear. our Mother

226
00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:27.121
and you are not really Eric
Wilson.

227
00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:30.958
You are the reincarnation of
a King named Zhayian Crehin.

228
00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:36.297
Lord of Merc. master of
the Nebtonian art form.

229
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:40.134
You ruled over the Eastern
sector 2000 years ago.

230
00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:43.095
- Wait. wait. hold on.

231
00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:46.182
So your saying that this is not
Earth

232
00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.934
but a planet called Rosser.

233
00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.645
- It's pronounced Ressear.

234
00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.983
- Okay. alright. yes. so if
that's true.

235
00:12:55.983 --> 00:12:57.318
how did I get here?

236
00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.403
Do you own a spaceship or
something?

237
00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:01.322
- No. I bridged you over.

238
00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:06.327
- Bridged me over. you mean
like beam me up Scotty?

239
00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:09.663
- Something like that. just more
organic.

240
00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:11.499
- Okay. yeah.

241
00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:15.336
- Don't mock me Eric. this is
not a joke!

242
00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:17.338
A great soldier and good
friend gave his life

243
00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:19.924
creating this bridge to find
you!

244
00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:21.592
- I'm sorry. I am sorry.

245
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.970
- His name was Akinnis. remember
that!

246
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.433
He was the only one that
believed in prophecy.

247
00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:30.851
He believed in you.

248
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:33.312
- Alright alright.

249
00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:34.772
- We have a new threat.

250
00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:38.317
(fire flickering)
A gifted warlock named Yahzeel

251
00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.319
who's taking over most of
Ressear.

252
00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:41.153
(screeching)

253
00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:49.370
Combine forces and take over
both Ressear

254
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.663
and your planet. Earth.

255
00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:53.874
- Why does he need Yahzeel?

256
00:13:53.874 --> 00:13:55.876
- Because he can't do it
himself.

257
00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:56.919
(whooshing)

258
00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:03.968
Only Yahzeel
(background screeching)

259
00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:06.887
has the power and intellect to
do so.

260
00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:10.391
- And so you think that
I can help with this?

261
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.309
- Of course. you're Lord Crehin.

262
00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:15.521
But you can't do it yourself.

263
00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:16.856
You need to find the other three

264
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:19.066
and assemble the Royal Four.

265
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:20.359
- The Royal Four?

266
00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:23.654
- Yes. that is how the
citizens began to call you

267
00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:25.781
after you defeated Yahzeel.

268
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:29.535
- Look Sofia. look. lo.
I am no hero king. okay.

269
00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.246
and this world that you
live in doesn't even

270
00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:35.416
sound like a place that I
wanna be a part of. okay?

271
00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:38.460
I am just Eric Wilson an
analyst. alright?

272
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.462
And thanks to you. I--
- Okay.

273
00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:46.343
I'll take you back. but let
me do this one first. okay?

274
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.391
- This is the Stone of Essence.

275
00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:55.811
After you guys defeated Yahzeel.

276
00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:58.272
you had the four of you insert a
part

277
00:14:58.272 --> 00:15:00.941
of your essence into this stone.

278
00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:01.775
- Why?

279
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:05.779
- To help find you in your new
bodies.

280
00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:08.741
in case a great evil
threatens our Mother again.

281
00:15:10.117 --> 00:15:11.577
And only someone strong

282
00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:14.955
and pure of heart would
be able to command it.

283
00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:18.500
- So I'm guessing you're the
strong and pure of heart.

284
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.002
- So far.

285
00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:22.880
- To be sure that you're Lord
Crehin.

286
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.590
I need to see if your blood
flows

287
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.716
with our Mothers energy.

288
00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:28.302
- Wha. wait. hold on. so you
plan on

289
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:29.845
cutting me open or something?

290
00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:32.264
- No. I just need you to stay
seated

291
00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:34.934
and if this doesn't work.

292
00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:38.187
I promise. I will take
you back myself. okay?

293
00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:40.648
(clicks tongue)

294
00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:41.899
(sighs)

295
00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:45.486
- Alright. fine. let's get this
over with.

296
00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:47.571
- Keep your palms closed.

297
00:15:55.829 --> 00:16:00.834
(Sofia softly chants)
(ominous music)

298
00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:09.343
(loud whooshing)

299
00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:10.344
(grinding)

300
00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:22.523
Ooh! (groaning) stop
please. please stop. stop!

301
00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:39.540
(heavy breathing)

302
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:44.211
(gentle music)

303
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:45.045
- No. no.

304
00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:51.093
But the stone glowed.

305
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.223
Maybe I was in the right area

306
00:16:56.223 --> 00:16:57.516
but I had the wrong guy.

307
00:16:59.643 --> 00:17:00.477
So why?

308
00:17:00.477 --> 00:17:03.355
(heavy breathing)

309
00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:04.189
All I have to do

310
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:05.399
is take him back
(digital zapping)

311
00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.568
and look for a more robust man.

312
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.155
Yeah.

313
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.408
(electric zapping)

314
00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:16.285
- Gom BY Ronen Boa!

315
00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.578
(loud bang)

316
00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:20.414
(heavy thud)
- Ah!

317
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.586
(heavy breathing)

318
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.340
- Go Ron Bi Corr Vel Oa!

319
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.509
(loud bang)

320
00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:34.053
Where's my wife?

321
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.846
Where is my son?

322
00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:37.347
Speak maggot!

323
00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:38.182
- I brought you back

324
00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:41.685
Speak!

325
00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:44.104
- Our Mother is in great danger.

326
00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:46.607
We need you to help
assemble the Royal Four!

327
00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:48.192
- What do you know of us?

328
00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:50.110
- I know you are heroes.

329
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.946
You saved our Mother from
Yahzeel

330
00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:55.407
and you created the Stone
of Essence to find you.

331
00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:57.785
- Only the strong and pure of
heart

332
00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:00.746
can find the Stone of
Essence and wheel its power.

333
00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:01.622
Is this you?

334
00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:03.040
- Yes sire.

335
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.042
- Then show me my stone.

336
00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:11.590
- Here is the Stone of Essence.

337
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.927
(dramatic music)

338
00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:19.932
- (exhales sharply) It's
been a long time my friend.

339
00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:24.186
I can still feel us all in here.

340
00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:26.772
Let's find our comrades.

341
00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:29.775
- Sire?

342
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:32.152
- Who are you and what is your
title?

343
00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:35.989
- I'm Sofia Hayden. army
commander of your kingdom Merc.

344
00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:38.325
- Army commander?
- Yes sire.

345
00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:40.869
- What day and age is this?

346
00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:42.162
- 21st century sire.

347
00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:44.832
- Interesting.

348
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.878
If you are who you say you are.
show me your soldiers mark.

349
00:18:56.718 --> 00:18:59.138
- Army commander. good to meet
you.

350
00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.558
Now who's this creature
that threatens our Mother?

351
00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:04.143
- His name is Sil.

352
00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:07.479
He's taken over many
lands and plans on finding

353
00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:10.649
and resurrect Yahzeel.
- (loud crunching) Yahzeel!

354
00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:12.359
What does he know about Yahzeel?

355
00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:13.694
- I believe he wants to use him

356
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:16.363
to take over--
- Yahzeel cannot be used.

357
00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:18.365
He cannot be reasoned with.

358
00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:21.034
That's why we buried
his corpse so far down.

359
00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:22.035
There nobody--
(loud bang)

360
00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:25.038
(voices whispering)

361
00:19:25.038 --> 00:19:25.873
Ooh!

362
00:19:27.624 --> 00:19:30.085
Who are these people in my head?

363
00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:32.880
(loud whooshing)

364
00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:36.550
Get out of my head!

365
00:19:37.467 --> 00:19:42.139
(screaming)
(whooshing)

366
00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:44.725
(loud banging)

367
00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:45.559
Ah!

368
00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:48.729
By Loe Bor. Ah!

369
00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.316
(loud whooshing)

370
00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:53.400
- Sofia!

371
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.986
(groaning)

372
00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.196
What are you doing?

373
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.739
(loud bang)

374
00:19:58.739 --> 00:19:59.573
- Gah!

375
00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:05.245
(loud whooshing)

376
00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:12.920
- Sire. sire. sire?

377
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.507
Sire. sire.

378
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:21.345
Hm.

379
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.723
Welcome home sire.

380
00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:29.811
(birds tweeting)

381
00:20:31.104 --> 00:20:34.274
(footsteps crunching)

382
00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:44.493
(heavy breathing)

383
00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:01.551
(foreboding music)

384
00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.442
- They're close.

385
00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:23.615
(low growling)

386
00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:26.118
(tense music)

387
00:21:29.496 --> 00:21:31.748
(growling)

388
00:21:55.522 --> 00:22:00.527
(suspenseful music)
(creature growling)

389
00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:22.424
(dramatic music)

390
00:23:58.603 --> 00:23:59.813
- You were one of us?

391
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.152
Oh my god.

392
00:24:05.152 --> 00:24:06.736
What has Sil done to you?

393
00:24:06.736 --> 00:24:07.571
To us?

394
00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.157
If I had known brother...

395
00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:17.080
Rest.

396
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.249
and may Mother find you a
peaceful vessel.

397
00:24:19.249 --> 00:24:22.002
(dramatic music)

398
00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:32.762
(hisses)
(dramatic music)

399
00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:37.767
(growling)
(bones cracking)

400
00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:42.522
- [Soldier] Lord. are you
alright?

401
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.193
(dramatic music)

402
00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:54.701
- Commander. it's Lord Sil.

403
00:24:56.995 --> 00:24:59.122
- Yes. my love.
- Where are you?

404
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.542
- I just leaving Syfal.
- Good.

405
00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:05.712
Meet me at the northern end
of SiKoran by the bridge.

406
00:25:05.712 --> 00:25:08.131
- SiKoran. why in--
- Cayla. just be there!

407
00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:10.300
- What is it?

408
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.552
- He wants us to meet him in
SiKoran.

409
00:25:13.428 --> 00:25:15.931
- SiKoran. why?
- I don't know.

410
00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:19.059
but if he insists. it must be
important.

411
00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:23.188
(phone ringing)

412
00:25:24.397 --> 00:25:27.317
- Ahh. Vowlan. I haven't heard
from you in quite some time.

413
00:25:27.317 --> 00:25:29.069
You better have good news for
me.

414
00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:32.197
- [Vowlan] Yes. my lord.
we have got Yahzeel.

415
00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.698
- Are you sure it's Yahzeel?

416
00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:35.075
- [Vowlan] It is him.

417
00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:37.077
- Are you positive?

418
00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:38.578
- [Vowlan] Yes. I am very
positive.

419
00:25:38.578 --> 00:25:41.164
- Good work Vowlan. very good.

420
00:25:42.582 --> 00:25:44.084
Make sure to secure the area.

421
00:25:44.918 --> 00:25:46.169
- [Vowlan] But there was a
problem.

422
00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:47.921
SiKoran has woken.

423
00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:48.880
- What?

424
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.257
- [Vowlan] He's killing
everyone.

425
00:25:50.257 --> 00:25:51.550
- I'll take care of it.

426
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.135
You just make sure nothing
comes near that site.

427
00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:55.387
You understand!

428
00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:57.138
- [Vowlan] Yes. I do.

429
00:25:58.765 --> 00:26:01.518
(dramatic music)

430
00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:21.621
- Where did you learn
to fight like that. boy?

431
00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:24.499
- Fight like what?

432
00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:26.793
I was just trying to defend
myself.

433
00:26:26.793 --> 00:26:29.379
- Don't lie to me.

434
00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:32.090
Where did you learn to fight
like that?

435
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.466
Who trained you?

436
00:26:34.342 --> 00:26:36.636
What is your species?

437
00:26:36.636 --> 00:26:38.805
- I. I'm just a villager. I
swear.

438
00:26:38.805 --> 00:26:40.181
That goon was trying to kill me.
okay.

439
00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:43.351
I just did what came natural.
- Exactly!

440
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:48.315
Common villagers don't
fight like that. unless

441
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:50.275
they're some type of spy.

442
00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:52.819
Are you this.

443
00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:54.446
a spy.

444
00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:55.989
villager?

445
00:26:55.989 --> 00:26:58.825
Are you some sort of resistance
groupie

446
00:26:58.825 --> 00:27:01.995
hoping to bring back the good
old days?

447
00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:04.664
(laughs)

448
00:27:04.664 --> 00:27:05.707
Maybe I should open you up

449
00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:08.376
and spill your hope all over the
ground.

450
00:27:08.376 --> 00:27:09.919
- Please. Miss. I'm not a spy
for the--

451
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:13.089
- It's Lieutenant Kryst to you.
boy.

452
00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.885
- I'm sorry Lieutenant.

453
00:27:18.094 --> 00:27:20.138
But I'm not a spy for the
resistance.

454
00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:23.350
I'm a spy for the New Republic.

455
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.309
- Really?

456
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.187
How so?

457
00:27:27.187 --> 00:27:29.356
- Commander Korvesian
tasked with a mission.

458
00:27:30.607 --> 00:27:32.525
I'm supposed to locate any
nearby resistance groups

459
00:27:32.525 --> 00:27:34.194
and report back to her.

460
00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:36.696
- Commander Cayla Korvesian

461
00:27:36.696 --> 00:27:38.990
task you with a mission?

462
00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:41.201
- Yes.

463
00:27:41.201 --> 00:27:42.410
I'm supposed to infiltrate their
ranks

464
00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.037
and find out what my town leader
knew

465
00:27:44.037 --> 00:27:45.205
and report back to her.

466
00:27:47.707 --> 00:27:50.293
- What sector are you from?

467
00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:53.505
- The western sector.

468
00:27:55.256 --> 00:27:57.133
- That's Syfal's area.

469
00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:00.887
How you plan to do this
without him knowing?

470
00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:05.016
- He's dead.

471
00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:07.352
Cayla killed him.

472
00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:11.189
- That would make it easier.

473
00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:15.402
Does the Commander know
about your fighting skill?

474
00:28:16.403 --> 00:28:17.862
- No. I don't have one.

475
00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:20.198
Look. I've seen your
soldiers fight before.

476
00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:22.701
I just tried a few moves and got
lucky.

477
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:27.080
- Moves like that are not built
with luck.

478
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.958
You'll come with us and I'll
find out who you really are.

479
00:28:31.167 --> 00:28:32.460
- Please. Lieutenant. please

480
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.254
I have to complete this mission.

481
00:28:34.254 --> 00:28:36.548
otherwise my village is
gonna be slaughtered.

482
00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:39.467
- That is not my concern.

483
00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:41.761
Guard.

484
00:28:41.761 --> 00:28:46.766
(dramatic music)
(phone keys beeping)

485
00:28:46.766 --> 00:28:48.393
- [Quilinresh] This is
Supreme World Alliance.

486
00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:49.978
- Hello Quilinresh.

487
00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:51.688
I'm needing to schedule
an emergency meeting

488
00:28:51.688 --> 00:28:53.565
with the committee tonight.

489
00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:55.108
- [Quilinresh] Ooh. it's
kind of last minute.

490
00:28:55.108 --> 00:28:55.942
I don't know if I can--

491
00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:57.193
- I'm sure you can gather them.

492
00:28:57.193 --> 00:28:58.528
- [Quilinresh] Well. you
know tomorrow is the event--

493
00:28:58.528 --> 00:29:00.739
- Yes. yes. I know Kyten is-
- Good.

494
00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:02.323
so they don't really want any
disturbance during this time.

495
00:29:02.323 --> 00:29:04.284
- Cut me off again. Quilinresh.

496
00:29:04.284 --> 00:29:07.495
and I will send Cayla to visit
your family tonight instead.

497
00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:09.998
- [Quilinresh] What about 9:00
p.m.?

498
00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:12.459
- Yes. 9:00 p.m. will be
perfect.

499
00:29:12.459 --> 00:29:13.293
- [Quilinresh] Good.

500
00:29:13.293 --> 00:29:14.294
- We'll be dining in the Red
Chamber.

501
00:29:14.294 --> 00:29:16.045
- [Quilinresh] Then I'll
go and contact them.

502
00:29:16.045 --> 00:29:17.714
- Good. see you there.

503
00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:27.432
- Lieutenant. please listen to
me.

504
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:28.558
If I was to come with you.

505
00:29:28.558 --> 00:29:30.018
and Commander Korvesian finds
out

506
00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:31.269
that you interfered with a
mission

507
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:32.479
directly instructed by her.

508
00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:34.481
how is that gonna look on you?

509
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.150
You really want to take that
chance?

510
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.652
She's known as The Daughter of
Demons.

511
00:29:40.653 --> 00:29:42.447
Do you really wanna gamble with
her?

512
00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:46.826
- Guard.

513
00:29:46.826 --> 00:29:48.369
call headquarters.

514
00:29:48.369 --> 00:29:49.871
Confirm the story.

515
00:29:58.254 --> 00:30:01.424
- Lieutenant. they do not
know anything about this.

516
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.384
- Of course they wouldn't.

517
00:30:03.384 --> 00:30:04.844
I just came from her an hour
ago.

518
00:30:07.263 --> 00:30:08.348
- Call the Commander!

519
00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:10.558
- Directly?

520
00:30:10.558 --> 00:30:11.643
We're normally not allowed to--

521
00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:13.645
- Shut up and just do it!

522
00:30:18.024 --> 00:30:20.693
(phone ringing)

523
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:23.196
- No one's answering.

524
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.868
- It's your call. Lieutenant.

525
00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:30.537
- I know it's my call!

526
00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:32.247
Just shut up and let me think!

527
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:38.044
Fuck!

528
00:30:39.128 --> 00:30:40.255
Okay.

529
00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:41.631
spy!

530
00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:44.425
Go ahead and complete your task.

531
00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:48.429
But if I find out you're lying
to me...

532
00:30:53.059 --> 00:30:57.313
- Thank you. Lieutenant.
- Don't thank me.

533
00:30:57.313 --> 00:31:00.358
You just better be right for
your sake.

534
00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:09.742
Keep a tag on him.

535
00:31:09.742 --> 00:31:12.537
As soon as he reaches the
resistance.

536
00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.747
send me his coordinates.

537
00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:20.420
It's time for things
to change around here.

538
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.172
(dramatic music)

539
00:31:56.831 --> 00:31:57.790
- [Guard] Lord Sil.

540
00:32:01.836 --> 00:32:03.463
[Both] My love.

541
00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:06.257
- My beautiful demons. tell
me. what have you learned?

542
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.217
- Not much.

543
00:32:10.845 --> 00:32:13.848
out of this forest by
someone in a black cloak.

544
00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:15.767
- Who saw him?

545
00:32:17.393 --> 00:32:20.897
- A young boy from Syfal's
village named Orin.

546
00:32:20.897 --> 00:32:22.315
- Was Syfal aware of this?

547
00:32:22.315 --> 00:32:24.817
- [Cayla] He was. but he lied
about it.

548
00:32:24.817 --> 00:32:26.486
- [Sil] Where is he now?

549
00:32:26.486 --> 00:32:29.989
- Still in the barn with a
severed head.

550
00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:31.157
- Good.

551
00:32:31.157 --> 00:32:32.700
Anything on the Resistance?

552
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.453
- No. but I gave that young Orin
a task

553
00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:36.663
to find out what he can

554
00:32:36.663 --> 00:32:39.207
and report back to me in two
weeks.

555
00:32:39.207 --> 00:32:41.334
- [Sil] Are you so sure
you can trust this kid?

556
00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:44.045
- If he wants a family to come
back to.

557
00:32:44.045 --> 00:32:48.007
Besides. no one knows Syfal's
dead beyond that barn.

558
00:32:48.007 --> 00:32:51.302
The Resistance will just
look at him as some loner.

559
00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:52.887
- And from what we gathered.

560
00:32:52.887 --> 00:32:54.639
the king's protector may have
taken him

561
00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:56.391
to the northern sector of the
city.

562
00:32:58.017 --> 00:32:59.686
- Well. you may not
need to concern yourself

563
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:01.729
with his location any longer.

564
00:33:01.729 --> 00:33:05.358
I've just had a very clear
vision of him running down a
road

565
00:33:05.358 --> 00:33:06.609
alone.

566
00:33:06.609 --> 00:33:08.319
- Can you see which road he's
on?

567
00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:10.530
- No. which is why I brought you
here.

568
00:33:11.739 --> 00:33:12.573
As you know.

569
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.868
we stand in the mighty Forest of
SiKoran

570
00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:18.830
grown from the ashes of the
legendary monk

571
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:23.543
Reynu SiKoran himself.
thousand of years ago.

572
00:33:23.543 --> 00:33:27.046
His roots run deep within
Mother.

573
00:33:27.046 --> 00:33:29.924
linking us all in millions of
ways.

574
00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:34.721
I can use his essence to
find their exact location.

575
00:33:36.055 --> 00:33:38.599
- My love. entering into
an immortal's essence pool

576
00:33:38.599 --> 00:33:39.892
is suicide.

577
00:33:39.892 --> 00:33:41.352
It's too dangerous.

578
00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:42.979
It's pull is too strong.

579
00:33:42.979 --> 00:33:44.897
It could drain you till you're
dead.

580
00:33:44.897 --> 00:33:46.315
- Il-Roserious is right.

581
00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:48.651
You very powerful my love.

582
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:52.947
but SiKoran is one of the Five
Immortal Wonders of Ressear.

583
00:33:52.947 --> 00:33:54.615
No one has ever survived

584
00:33:54.615 --> 00:33:56.617
after tampering with their
essence pool.

585
00:34:01.414 --> 00:34:02.999
- None of them were me.

586
00:34:06.127 --> 00:34:09.505
It is time for SiKoran
and all life on Ressear

587
00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:11.174
to know that I am a God!

588
00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:15.219
(creature growling)

589
00:34:17.972 --> 00:34:20.183
Stay down you wicked creature!

590
00:34:20.183 --> 00:34:22.268
I am your Lord now!

591
00:34:22.268 --> 00:34:27.273
(creature growling)
(speaking in foreign language)

592
00:34:31.527 --> 00:34:34.614
You listen to me now Reynu!

593
00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:37.784
(creature screeching)

594
00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:46.501
(growling)

595
00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:47.668
Down creature!

596
00:35:01.557 --> 00:35:03.476
- My Lord you...

597
00:35:03.476 --> 00:35:04.769
What you did was...

598
00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:07.563
The power running through your
body

599
00:35:07.563 --> 00:35:09.816
would have killed the
strongest of art forms.

600
00:35:10.817 --> 00:35:11.943
How do you feel?

601
00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:14.654
- I feel marvelous!

602
00:35:15.822 --> 00:35:19.158
SiKorn's essence is everything I
imagined.

603
00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:22.286
And now he belongs to me.

604
00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:23.663
He's under my control.

605
00:35:25.081 --> 00:35:26.249
- Do you need anything?

606
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.502
- Yes.

607
00:35:29.502 --> 00:35:32.380
I need for you to bring me
the king's head in a bag

608
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.923
and place it on my table.

609
00:35:35.258 --> 00:35:37.802
I wanna be able to look him in
the eyes

610
00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:39.512
While I enjoy my meal.

611
00:35:40.763 --> 00:35:43.057
- Did you happen to see where he
is?

612
00:35:44.433 --> 00:35:47.270
(dramatic music)

613
00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:51.691
- The king is headed for the
Ti Forest on the west end.

614
00:35:52.692 --> 00:35:54.986
He'll be there within the hour.

615
00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:56.529
- You should join us my love.

616
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:58.364
It will be fun.

617
00:35:59.532 --> 00:36:01.534
- You go enjoy yourselves.

618
00:36:01.534 --> 00:36:02.702
I have much to do.

619
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.914
But hurry. we're having company
tonight.

620
00:36:06.914 --> 00:36:08.291
A new era has begun.

621
00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:15.798
(tense music)

622
00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:20.761
(dramatic music)

623
00:36:21.762 --> 00:36:24.056
You thought you can hide Yahzeel
from me.

624
00:36:24.056 --> 00:36:25.433
didn't you SiKoran?

625
00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:27.351
Do you need help. miss?

626
00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:30.479
You answer to me now.

627
00:36:30.479 --> 00:36:32.732
(growling)

628
00:36:32.732 --> 00:36:33.900
Once I revive Yahzeel

629
00:36:35.234 --> 00:36:38.237
and learn the art forms of the
Royal 4.

630
00:36:38.237 --> 00:36:41.616
I will be a god among gods.

631
00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:43.117
(dramatic music)

632
00:36:43.117 --> 00:36:43.951
Ressear.

633
00:36:44.076 --> 00:36:45.536
(Fire swoosh)

634
00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:46.954
Earth.

635
00:36:48.122 --> 00:36:51.751
and all living things will bow
before me.

636
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.923
(dramatic music)

637
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:08.935
- Hello?

638
00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:11.354
Are you okay?

639
00:37:12.438 --> 00:37:13.940
My name. my name is Eric.

640
00:37:14.273 --> 00:37:15.942
Do you need help. Ms. Um...

641
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:19.528
- Well. hello.

642
00:37:19.528 --> 00:37:22.281
(dramatic music)

643
00:37:24.617 --> 00:37:27.286
(Eric grunting)

644
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.206
- Who are you people?

645
00:37:30.206 --> 00:37:31.290
Are you with Sophia?

646
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.458
- Sophia?

647
00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:35.711
I don't know any Sophia. but I
know you.

648
00:37:35.711 --> 00:37:39.632
My Lord says you are one of the
legendary Royal 4.

649
00:37:39.632 --> 00:37:41.842
- Look. I don't know what you're
talking about. okay?

650
00:37:41.842 --> 00:37:43.761
I am no king.

651
00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:45.972
- How did you know we were
talking about kings?

652
00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:47.390
- Does it matter?

653
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:48.224
Okay?

654
00:37:48.224 --> 00:37:50.643
I am not part of no Royal 4.

655
00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.939
- Yes you are. yes you are.

656
00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:58.609
Sil says you are the
reincarnation. one of the kings.

657
00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:00.820
So which one are you?

658
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.824
- (grunts) Look. this is just a
big misunderstanding. okay?

659
00:38:04.824 --> 00:38:05.700
I was held--

660
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.368
(shushing)

661
00:38:07.368 --> 00:38:09.370
(Cayla sniffs)

662
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.205
- You do smell different.

663
00:38:12.206 --> 00:38:14.834
- (grunts) Ah. bitch.

664
00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:16.877
- No. my name is Cayla.

665
00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:21.340
(ominous music)

666
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.473
You are special.

667
00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:33.352
I've never tasted blood from an
ancient before.

668
00:38:33.352 --> 00:38:35.271
You could say you're my first.

669
00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:38.190
(metal scraping)

670
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:40.318
(Eric grunting)

671
00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:43.863
You haven't realized yet. but
before you do.

672
00:38:43.863 --> 00:38:45.906
Sil wants your head back in a
bag.

673
00:38:46.866 --> 00:38:49.243
Of course. I'd prefer to keep
you as my pet.

674
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:54.623
but such is life.

675
00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:57.710
(whizzing)

676
00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:00.546
(dramatic music)

677
00:39:15.394 --> 00:39:17.396
- Sire. stay behind me.

678
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:26.405
- Did you just hit me with a
rock?

679
00:39:26.405 --> 00:39:28.449
That wasn't very nice.

680
00:39:29.617 --> 00:39:32.244
So what do we call you?

681
00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:37.583
- My name is Sofia Hayden. army
commander of Merc.

682
00:39:39.668 --> 00:39:40.795
- The City of Merc?

683
00:39:42.671 --> 00:39:45.508
I thought we buried all you
cockroaches.

684
00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:47.760
- [Sofia] As long as I still
breath.

685
00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.804
Merc lives. Cayla Korvesian.

686
00:39:51.847 --> 00:39:53.516
- Oh. so you know me?

687
00:39:54.642 --> 00:39:58.521
- Of course. a sadistic bitch
with daddy issues.

688
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:04.735
- Well. I killed daddy. so he's
not an issue anymore.

689
00:40:07.613 --> 00:40:10.991
Look. let's get this over with.
shall we?

690
00:40:10.991 --> 00:40:13.327
Hand over your king and I'll let
you live.

691
00:40:14.286 --> 00:40:15.913
- So let's get it over with.

692
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:20.793
Talingol byne kon-yet.

693
00:40:22.545 --> 00:40:24.380
(fire roaring)

694
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.715
(whooshing)

695
00:40:34.557 --> 00:40:37.268
So what they say is true about
the Korvesians.

696
00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:41.439
Your bloodline is resistant to
chants.

697
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.149
- Well. this isn't fair.

698
00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:45.067
You know quite a bit about me.

699
00:40:45.067 --> 00:40:49.697
but I've never heard of you.
Sofia Hayden.

700
00:40:49.697 --> 00:40:51.157
- Commander Hayden to you!

701
00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:56.996
(pistol firing)

702
00:40:56.996 --> 00:40:59.748
(metal clanging)

703
00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:04.753
- Girl. if you wanna piece of
me.

704
00:41:04.753 --> 00:41:07.131
you're gonna have to do it the
old fashion way.

705
00:41:10.384 --> 00:41:14.096
- Then. so be it.

706
00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:17.099
(suspenseful music)

707
00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:37.161
(swords clanging) (tense music)

708
00:41:47.379 --> 00:41:50.341
(thuds) (Cayla grunts)

709
00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:53.135
(swords clanging)

710
00:41:53.135 --> 00:41:55.137
(thuds)

711
00:41:56.305 --> 00:41:57.932
(Sofia grunts)

712
00:41:57.932 --> 00:42:00.768
(inhales sharply)

713
00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:22.331
(swords faintly clanging)

714
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.418

Accept it or die. Tenan.

00:45:23.095 --> 00:45:25.764
- Okay. fine.

761
00:45:25.764 --> 00:45:28.142

are.

798
00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:12.514
but you seem to be the reason
for all this.

799
00:48:12.514 --> 00:48:14.766
Stay down and don't move.

800
00:48:14.766 --> 00:48:16.101

No matter. I'll find your weak
spot

812

- We must kill her.

830
00:50:03.625 --> 00:50:05.210
She's too dangerous to survive.

831
00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.044
- I know.

832
00:50:07.212 --> 00:50:08.296
Now go help your king.

- [Tenan Voiceover] King?

835
00:50:12.718 --> 00:50:14.720
What king is she talking about?

836
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:19.433
- When I kill you. I want you to
know it's me.

837
00:50:19.433 --> 00:50:21.601
Until then. Cayla.

838
00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:23.395

839
00:50:23.395 --> 00:50:25.480
(tense music)

840
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.859

(inhales sharply)

843
00:50:37.576 --> 00:50:38.410
- Get off me!

844
00:50:40.412 --> 00:50:44.166
Take two of your men and head
that way.

845
00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:46.001
There are four of them.

846
00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:48.253
Bring me back the odd one.

847
00:50:50.088 --> 00:50:52.132

You and you. come with me.

- Commander. Lord Sil requests
you come home immediately.

850
00:51:03.977 --> 00:51:07.064
He's scheduled a meeting with
the committee.

851
00:51:07.064 --> 00:51:08.190
- Fine.

852
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:09.566

859
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.896
(chants words)

860
00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:15.734
- [Man] Akinnis!

861
00:53:15.734 --> 00:53:16.568
Akinnis!

862
00:53:21.907 --> 00:53:25.243
- [Goon] Are you trying to
build a bridge to Earth?

863
00:53:26.578 --> 00:53:28.079
That's a myth. soldier!

864
00:53:29.122 --> 00:53:33.418
Those rebels filled your head
with talk of a sister planet.

865
00:53:33.418 --> 00:53:39.424
Akinnis. do what's right.
and vow your allegiance to Sil.

866
00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:43.803
- I am getting really tired of
seeing your ugly face. Goon!

867
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.976

(chants words)

870
00:54:05.784 --> 00:54:10.497
- [Goon] Akinnis. you really
think this will stop you?

871
00:54:10.497 --> 00:54:12.832
(whooshing)

872
00:54:23.468 --> 00:54:26.179
(battle music)

873
00:54:26.179 --> 00:54:27.013
Argh!

874
00:54:42.487 --> 00:54:43.697
- Fucking Goon.

875
00:54:47.325 --> 00:54:49.536
(grunting)

876
00:54:52.706 --> 00:54:54.165
- [Goon] Akinnis!

877
00:54:55.709 --> 00:54:57.043
Give up already!

878
00:54:58.503 --> 00:55:01.548
Your band of rebels are all but
dead!

879
00:55:01.548 --> 00:55:03.049
Your race is dead.

880
00:55:04.342 --> 00:55:07.304
Sil is the true law of this
planet!

881
00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:09.597
Can't you see that?

882
00:55:09.597 --> 00:55:12.058
- Sil's days are numbered. the
royal four

883
00:55:12.058 --> 00:55:14.978
will return to put him down.

884
00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:17.439
- [Goon] You were once a
revered soldier of Merc.

885
00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:22.861
a legend of your race.
but look at you now.

886
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:25.739
Running around. looking for
ghosts with a band of misfits.

887
00:55:28.199 --> 00:55:30.869
What would your dead family
think?

888
00:55:30.869 --> 00:55:32.078
(laughs)

889
00:55:32.078 --> 00:55:34.205
- Shut up and just die!

890
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:38.376
(action music)

891
00:55:48.636 --> 00:55:50.889
(snapping)

892
00:56:03.818 --> 00:56:06.154
(whooshing)

893
00:56:07.906 --> 00:56:10.909
- [Creature] Shit. the children.

894
00:56:10.909 --> 00:56:12.577
- Go ahead. kill me!

895
00:56:13.912 --> 00:56:16.581
The kings will be found!

896
00:56:16.581 --> 00:56:18.333
And Sil will be done.

897
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:29.636
(action music)

898
00:56:36.601 --> 00:56:39.104
(funky music)

899
00:57:17.851 --> 00:57:19.436
- Eric.

900
00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:20.645
Eric.

901
00:57:20.645 --> 00:57:21.563
Eric!

902
00:57:23.648 --> 00:57:25.483
- Yeah. I noticed that.

903
00:57:25.483 --> 00:57:26.985
Hey. you wanna hit that new bar

904
00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:28.820
around the corner after work?

905
00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:33.825
- Naw. I may just stay
home tonight and meditate.

906
00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:35.201
- Meditate?

907
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:38.705
Look. Raquel's a bitch
bro. she played all of us.

908
00:57:38.705 --> 00:57:40.165
- Yeah maybe.

909
00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:43.585
- Yeah. you need to let her go.

910
00:57:43.585 --> 00:57:44.836
You need to meet me down to the
bar

911
00:57:44.836 --> 00:57:46.671
so we can find another Raquel.

912
00:57:46.671 --> 00:57:48.047
- Huh. what?

913
00:57:48.047 --> 00:57:49.799
- Yeah. I'm just saying.

914
00:57:55.555 --> 00:57:56.473
Damn!

915
00:57:59.392 --> 00:58:02.187
he is going to need a report
on each of these by the 16th.

916
00:58:02.187 --> 00:58:04.856
- The 16th. that only
leaves me 5 days. Monica.

917
00:58:04.856 --> 00:58:05.773
I don't know if--

918
00:58:05.773 --> 00:58:07.692
- Well you need to.

919
00:58:07.692 --> 00:58:10.653
If you have a problem with
it take it up with Mills.

920
00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:13.573
And you know what. that
means you will be fired.

921
00:58:13.573 --> 00:58:14.741
So pick your poison.

922
00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:18.161
- Yeah. yeah. I'll get on it.
it's fine.

923
00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:21.414
- Jimmy. would you mind?

924
00:58:21.414 --> 00:58:24.042
- You know Monika. your horns
are showing.

925
00:58:24.042 --> 00:58:24.959
- Eff you Jimmy!

926
00:58:27.795 --> 00:58:29.422
- That's one crazy bitch.

927
00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:34.636
Hey. five thirty. me. you.
women. new bar?

928
00:58:34.636 --> 00:58:36.262
- Man. you heard that demon.

929
00:58:36.262 --> 00:58:38.097
I gotta get this done by next
week

930
00:58:38.097 --> 00:58:40.391
and I need all the time that I
can get.

931
00:58:41.267 --> 00:58:46.231
- Look. you need to relax and
get laid before you explode.

932
00:58:47.899 --> 00:58:49.234
I'm gonna help you this weekend

933
00:58:49.234 --> 00:58:51.736
and get this project done. okay?

934
00:58:51.736 --> 00:58:53.571
- Come on Jimmy. seriously.

935
00:58:54.405 --> 00:58:56.074
Hey let me ask you something.

936
00:58:57.242 --> 00:58:58.868
Have you ever felt you were
meant for

937
00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:02.497
something larger in life. you
know. like something better

938
00:59:02.497 --> 00:59:04.332
than where we are now?

939
00:59:04.332 --> 00:59:06.584
- What. Eric what are you
talking about?

940
00:59:06.584 --> 00:59:08.670
- You know. like you
were meant for something

941
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:11.005
more meaningful that can change
the world?

942
00:59:11.005 --> 00:59:13.341
- Eric are you smoking your
socks?

943
00:59:13.341 --> 00:59:14.425
- I'm serious Jimmy.

944
00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:18.429
I feel like something big
is coming my way real soon.

945
00:59:18.429 --> 00:59:20.765
- I hope so. boobs. in your
face.

946
00:59:20.765 --> 00:59:22.767
- I'm serious bro. I
don't know what it is.

947
00:59:22.767 --> 00:59:24.811
but something is coming.

948
00:59:25.853 --> 00:59:29.107
- All I know is. you need to get
laid.

949
00:59:29.107 --> 00:59:32.443
You need to meet me tonight. at
the bar.

950
00:59:34.028 --> 00:59:35.405
with the bitches.

951
00:59:49.127 --> 00:59:52.297

952
00:59:52.297 --> 00:59:54.382
Help us. hurry.

953
00:59:54.382 --> 00:59:56.801
- Jimmy. stop screwing around.

954
00:59:58.136 --> 01:00:02.181
- [Mysterious Voices] Come back.

955
01:00:02.181 --> 01:00:04.559
- Jimmy. you know what.
if you're out there.

956
01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:10.148
- [Mysterious Voices] Remember.

957
01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:10.982
- Jimmy?

958
01:00:12.483 --> 01:00:13.318
Anybody?

959
01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:18.489
I think I'll have those drinks
now.

960
01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:38.676
- Let's do a toast. hey. my man
Eric!

961
01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.387
- [Crowd] Eric!

962
01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:43.640
(cheering)

963
01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:50.772
- Hey Jimmy. hey everyone.
thank you. thank you.

964
01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:53.107
- Glad to see you're gonna
live a little bit. huh?

965
01:00:54.692 --> 01:00:57.487
- Yeah yeah. I just needed
to take a break. that's all.

966
01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:02.033
- Look. Mills and watchdog.
don't worry about them. man.

967
01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:04.035
we'll get you a job somewhere
else.

968
01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:05.745
- Yeah. true. I just
don't want to start over

969
01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:08.581
somewhere else with some new
assholes and new ass rules.

970
01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.210
- There's gonna be assholes
you're gonna deal with in life.

971
01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.045
all the time. E.

972
01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:16.506
Your job is not let them
get you in your heart.

973
01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:20.343
- Yeah. thanks Jimmy.
you made sense for once.

974
01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:22.595
- Oh. you're trying to
be Mr Funny Man now. huh?

975
01:01:22.595 --> 01:01:23.429
- Hey Jim.

976
01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:27.600
buy me a drink Jimmy.

977
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.726
- What's in it for me?

978
01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:31.813
- Think of something.

979
01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:33.398
- Slick. let me get another two.

980
01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:48.037
(footsteps)

981
01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:55.628
- Ahem.

982
01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:57.672
- Oh hi.

983
01:01:58.798 --> 01:01:59.674
- I'm Sofia.

984
01:02:02.009 --> 01:02:05.930
- Sofia. er. hi. I'm Eric. Eric
Wilson.

985
01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:08.391
- Go Eric!

986
01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:14.272
- Oh. I'm sorry. were you
sitting here?

987
01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:16.023
- I just saw you with your
friend.

988
01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.943
He look like he'd rather buy
drinks

989
01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:20.445
than hang with hims friend.

990
01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:23.448
- Well you have to get to know
Jimmy

991
01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:25.241
to understand that he's a good
guy.

992
01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:30.121
Oh. I'm sorry. would you like to
sit down?

993
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:31.122
- [Sofia] Thank you.

994
01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:37.336
- Is everything all right. did
I spill something on my face.

995
01:02:37.336 --> 01:02:39.046
or did I spill something on
myself?

996
01:02:39.046 --> 01:02:40.798
- No. no you look good.
- Oh.

997
01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:44.427
- You just look familiar. that's
all.

998
01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.805
- So. erm. do you come here
often?

999
01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:50.224
Oh no no no. that was so
bad. I'm sorry. just. I'm.

1000
01:02:50.224 --> 01:02:51.058
- Relax.

1001
01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:54.103
(laughs)

1002
01:03:00.067 --> 01:03:03.321
- And that's why got
punished for two weeks.

1003
01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:08.951
- So I guess you played it
safe and became an analyst.

1004
01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.661
- Yeah. I guess you could say
that.

1005
01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:15.374
It pays the bills. but um.
can I ask you something?

1006
01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:18.169
No no. nevermind. forget it.

1007
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.088
- Too late. what is it?

1008
01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:23.466
- Well.

1009
01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:28.262
sometimes I feel that I'm
destined for bigger things.

1010
01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:31.390
like something important
is going to happen

1011
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:36.395
and I can be free of
this everyday hum drum.

1012
01:03:36.395 --> 01:03:39.023
I don't know. it' just crazy
talk. but.

1013
01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:42.485
- Not at all. I believe that

1014
01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:47.490
everyone was someone else
at one time or another

1015
01:03:47.698 --> 01:03:51.536
in another life. if you
believe in that sort of things.

1016
01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:54.413
- Actually. I do. I feel like
I'm built

1017
01:03:54.413 --> 01:03:55.873
in a different day and age.

1018
01:03:55.873 --> 01:03:57.875
you know like at a different
time.

1019
01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:01.379
and I have the ability
to make a positive impact

1020
01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:02.964
in people's lives.

1021
01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:06.050
- Well. let's talk about
going somewhere different.

1022
01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.427
- Sure. yeah. where would you
like to go?

1023
01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:11.848
- I know this great lounge
across town

1024
01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.016
that makes great wings.

1025
01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:16.936
- Wings and a lounge. sign me
up.

1026
01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.479
- I'll get the cab.

1027
01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:19.397
- And I'll be back.

1028
01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:29.198
You got this Eric. you got this.

1029
01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.741
Can't screw this up. all right.

1030
01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:32.910
You're a man. you're a man.

1031
01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:36.122
We can do this.

1032
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:52.805
- I got it. crazy!

1033
01:05:02.106 --> 01:05:04.901
- [Eric] So what's this
place called again?

1034
01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:06.527
- [Sofia] I forget.

1035
01:05:06.527 --> 01:05:09.989
but I already told the driver
where to go.

1036
01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.786
(groaning)

1037
01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:19.874
(birds calling)

1038
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:38.935
- Where am I?

1039
01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.354
Where is everybody?

1040
01:05:45.566 --> 01:05:46.400
Jimmy?

1041
01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:49.111
Sofia?

1042
01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:37.702
(screeching)

1043
01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:39.203
What is that?

1044
01:06:39.203 --> 01:06:41.372
(yelling)

1045
01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:46.711
(leaves rustling)

1046
01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:49.463
(sinister music)

1047
01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:04.145
(screeching)

1048
01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:09.066
Get away from me!

1049
01:07:09.066 --> 01:07:10.026
Get off me!

1050
01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:35.551
- [Figure] Come on. get up.
they'll be back soon. move!

1051
01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:38.137
(action music)

1052
01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.656
- Is it one of therm?

1053
01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:40.866
- Yes.

1054
01:08:42.159 --> 01:08:44.120
- Is it a king. or the queen?

1055
01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.248
- King. perhaps.

1056
01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.752
- Can you tell if he has
realized yet?

1057
01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:57.675
- I don't believe he has
realized who he is. yet.

1058
01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:01.595
This cloak over his location
I haven't felt before.

1059
01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:06.142
- Sire. who is this king
you are concerned with?

1060
01:09:08.769 --> 01:09:12.314
- Cayla. do you remember when
your father had you put away?

1061
01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:14.483
For you own good. he said.

1062
01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:20.364
Said your ways were. how did
he put it. unconventional.

1063
01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:22.408
- [Cayla] Yes.

1064
01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:23.909
- But you didn't believe that.

1065
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:28.956
Slaughtering your entire
family was mighty cold.

1066
01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.541
Overkill. perhaps.

1067
01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:34.920
But you were simply
nourishing your true nature.

1068
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.964
The real Cayla was born that
night.

1069
01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:40.509
- Yes. a glorious evening it
was.

1070
01:09:41.802 --> 01:09:46.265
- This king wants to destroy
everything we've built

1071
01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:49.185
and stand in the way of our
progress.

1072
01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.478
- Yes. sire. but.

1073
01:09:51.478 --> 01:09:54.190
haven't we killed all
of the opposing kings?

1074
01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:55.065
- Not this one.

1075
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.651
This is one returned.

1076
01:09:59.236 --> 01:10:00.738
One of those who imprisoned
Yahzeel

1077
01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:02.239
two thousand years ago.

1078
01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:05.910
I just can't be sure which one
it is.

1079
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.119
- The legend?

1080
01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:09.413
Of the queen and three kings.

1081
01:10:10.247 --> 01:10:11.332
I thought that was a myth.

1082
01:10:11.332 --> 01:10:15.002
- This is no myth. he is one of
them.

1083
01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:16.670
And you need to make him go
away.

1084
01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.341
Go and make him a myth for me.

1085
01:10:22.134 --> 01:10:23.427
and bring me back his head.

1086
01:10:23.427 --> 01:10:25.596
- It would be a pleasure. sire.

1087
01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:28.974
I can't wait to taste
the blood of an ancient.

1088
01:10:28.974 --> 01:10:31.268
How would I identify him?

1089
01:10:31.268 --> 01:10:32.853
- He will stand out.

1090
01:10:32.853 --> 01:10:35.272
He'll be the one they all
protect.

1091
01:10:35.272 --> 01:10:38.776
Go. be quick. he'll be a
bigger problem if he realizes.

1092
01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:49.787
- Sil. the children.

1093
01:10:51.288 --> 01:10:53.791
I feel they're in some sort of
pain.

1094
01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:55.668
That's impossible.

1095
01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:02.007
with ancient magic. well the
ancient magic can affect them.

1096
01:11:02.883 --> 01:11:05.010
So either his protector is well-
versed.

1097
01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:07.554
or the ancient essence
running through his veins

1098
01:11:07.554 --> 01:11:08.806
is enough to protect him.

1099
01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:13.435
- Maybe not. maybe it was
the level of intensity

1100
01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:16.647
and energy that we unleashed
in our last takeover.

1101
01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:19.233
It could have made a rip between
worlds.

1102
01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:20.651
- No. I would have felt it.

1103
01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:23.779
I didn't feel it open this time.

1104
01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:27.199
We gotta field this king.

1105
01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:31.870
This is not good.

1106
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:35.416
- Sil. our time is here and now.

1107
01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:38.419
We need to find and resurrect
Yahzeel immediately.

1108
01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:41.839
and end this fear of kings and
queens.

1109
01:11:42.756 --> 01:11:44.550
You are the only king.

1110
01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:48.637
You are the only real king
Ressear needs.

1111
01:11:50.222 --> 01:11:52.641
Everything is yours.

1112
01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.893
One Cayla Find and kills that
creature.

1113
01:11:54.893 --> 01:11:57.730
he will be a myth once more.

1114
01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:00.357
Let's continue with the plan

1115
01:12:00.357 --> 01:12:03.610
and become the god you are meant
to be.

1116
01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:05.195
- You are something. aren't you?

1117
01:12:06.196 --> 01:12:08.532
Prepare the plane for
home. we have much to do.

1118
01:12:44.234 --> 01:12:46.362
(snarls)

1119
01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.331
- [Figure] Come. on come on.
move.

1120
01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:59.500
(panting)

1121
01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:02.753
Come on. come on.

1122
01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:04.088
- Wait. wait. wait.

1123
01:13:04.088 --> 01:13:06.173
(grunts)

1124
01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:10.761
(chants words)

1125
01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:18.310
(groaning)

1126
01:13:21.188 --> 01:13:23.774
(chants words)

1127
01:13:26.443 --> 01:13:28.904
Look. look. look. I
have money int he bank.

1128
01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:30.155
I can give you it. I promise.

1129
01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:32.074
if you let me go I won't
say anything to anyone.

1130
01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:32.908
I don't even know--

1131
01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:33.784
- [Figure] Be quiet!

1132
01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:43.043
Does anything look familiar to
you?

1133
01:13:43.043 --> 01:13:45.212
- No. no. it doesn't.

1134
01:13:53.887 --> 01:13:55.347
- Hello. Eric.

1135
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:57.224
- Sofia?

1136
01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.268
Whoa re you?

1137
01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:01.812
Why. why are you dressed liked
that?

1138
01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:03.105
What the fuck is going on?

1139
01:14:05.315 --> 01:14:10.070
- You are the beginning
piece of saving our planet.

1140
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:11.655
- Saving our planet?

1141
01:14:11.655 --> 01:14:13.991
Look. I don't know what
kind of drugs you're on.

1142
01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:16.160
but I know a facility that
can help you with that--

1143
01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.495
- Shut up. and listen to me!

1144
01:14:19.496 --> 01:14:22.833
You need to remember who you
really are.

1145
01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:28.130
Remember when you told me
about a feeling you had

1146
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.716
of being part of something
larger?

1147
01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:34.261
Something important.
something worth fighting for?

1148
01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:38.432
Well that day is today.

1149
01:14:42.352 --> 01:14:43.395
Welcome back. sire.

1150
01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.648
- Sire?

1151
01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:47.983
What?

1152
01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:50.861
(mysterious music)
