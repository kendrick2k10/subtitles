3
00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:46.010
Santa?

4
00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:50.948
I knew you were real.

5
00:03:51.983 --> 00:03:54.585
- Well. hello there Kirra.
- You know my name?

6
00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:56.420
Oh my gosh. I knew it.

7
00:03:56.521 --> 00:03:58.956
Off course. I know your name.

8
00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:01.526
I can't believe I'm
talking to Santa right now.

9
00:04:02.493 --> 00:04:04.729
You're supposed to be
sleeping.

10
00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.097
I'm sorry I startled you.

11
00:04:06.196 --> 00:04:07.397
That's okay.

12
00:04:07.498 --> 00:04:09.967
Hey. thank you for the milk and
cookies.

13
00:04:10.068 --> 00:04:11.334
I would have made you cocoa.

14
00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:15.940
but since my grandma died we
haven't had any in the house.

15
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.407
It was her favorite.

16
00:04:17.508 --> 00:04:20.210
I know your grandma's very
proud of you.

17
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.378
I miss her a lot.

18
00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:24.782
Christmas was your
favorite time of the year.

19
00:04:24.882 --> 00:04:26.984
We used to read Christmas
stories together.

20
00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:29.887
She wrote her own Christmas
story that only me and her read.

21
00:04:29.987 --> 00:04:31.923
What was the name of it?

22
00:04:32.023 --> 00:04:33.558
"Kirra the Christmas Elf."

23
00:04:36.894 --> 00:04:37.995
It was about me.

24
00:04:39.163 --> 00:04:41.466
I've never told anybody that
before.

25
00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:45.136
That's okay. I promise
I won't tell anybody.

26
00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:47.270
I know she's watching over you
right now.

27
00:04:49.107 --> 00:04:51.109
Hey. just one second.

28
00:04:55.412 --> 00:04:56.614
Merry Christmas. Kirra.

29
00:04:58.216 --> 00:04:59.550
Thank you Santa.

30
00:05:00.752 --> 00:05:03.020
Well. go ahead and open it.

31
00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:04.155
Okay.

32
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:21.739
I don't mean to be ungrateful.

33
00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.442
but did I do something wrong
to get on the naughty list?

34
00:05:25.543 --> 00:05:26.944
Why. what is it?

35
00:05:28.112 --> 00:05:29.113
Coal.

36
00:05:32.884 --> 00:05:34.719
Oh my goodness Kirra.

37
00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:35.820
I'm so sorry.

38
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.688
I'm sure this is a mistake.

39
00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.725
That's okay Santa everybody
makes mistakes sometimes.

40
00:05:48.298 --> 00:05:49.299
Merry Christmas.

41
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.602
You know what?

42
00:05:51.702 --> 00:05:53.171
I'm gonna fix Christmas.

43
00:05:55.473 --> 00:05:56.674
Do you believe in magic?

44
00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:58.843
Not really

45
00:06:00.077 --> 00:06:02.847
Well. you're about to.

46
00:06:45.022 --> 00:06:46.023
Winnie?

47
00:06:51.963 --> 00:06:54.999
Get in my office now.

48
00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:59.070
Oh. he's mad.

49
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.992
Winnie sit down.

50
00:07:25.596 --> 00:07:27.265
I think you know why you're
here.

51
00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:30.167
I don't.

52
00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:34.538
Tonight. I gave a little girl
a present

53
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.275
that was not on her list.

54
00:07:38.276 --> 00:07:41.879
but the label said it was.

55
00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:45.182
Do you have any idea how that
happened?

56
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.352
No. Santa I don't.

57
00:07:49.387 --> 00:07:51.656
I'll have a word with the
elves in charge of labels.

58
00:07:51.756 --> 00:07:54.424
That wasn't the first mistake
tonight.

59
00:07:54.525 --> 00:07:57.261
A lot of the presents had the
wrong label.

60
00:07:57.361 --> 00:08:00.464
and the reindeer they've missed
meals.

61
00:08:01.365 --> 00:08:03.634
I said I will have
a word with the elves.

62
00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:06.003
Winnie. I'm sick and tired of
this.

63
00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:07.838
You're supposed to be the
leader.

64
00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:12.442
Santa. I will fix this.

65
00:08:15.646 --> 00:08:19.617
Winnie. it's too late.

66
00:08:21.252 --> 00:08:22.753
I have no choice but to...

67
00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:25.556
To what?

68
00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:28.993
Gather your things.

69
00:08:30.094 --> 00:08:31.095
put them on my desk.

70
00:08:33.097 --> 00:08:34.565
move yourself to the stable.

71
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.468
you're on cleanup duty.

72
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.938
Santa. I will fix this.

73
00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:42.707
Winnie. it's too late.

74
00:08:42.807 --> 00:08:45.910
I now have to fix this.

75
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.144
Key please.

76
00:08:50.348 --> 00:08:51.182
Key.

77
00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:17.575
I don't believe we've
met.

78
00:09:17.675 --> 00:09:18.776
are you new?

79
00:09:19.944 --> 00:09:23.347
No. not really. we've
actually met quite a few times.

80
00:09:23.447 --> 00:09:25.416
but I have a very forgettable
face.

81
00:09:25.516 --> 00:09:27.018
I'm Lovey. sir.

82
00:09:27.952 --> 00:09:30.955
I'm sorry. there's so many
faces.

83
00:09:31.055 --> 00:09:34.692
I promised when I come back
I'll learn everybody's name.

84
00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:39.964
and call me Santa.

85
00:09:40.064 --> 00:09:42.033
Yes. sir. Santa.

86
00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:45.536
Well. I really must
get going.

87
00:09:47.472 --> 00:09:48.639
I'm on it Santa.

88
00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:52.309
Santa Claus. cute name.

89
00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:56.180
Bye.

90
00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:30.047
Is everything okay?

91
00:10:36.387 --> 00:10:37.456
It will be.

92
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:42.927
How do you feel about being the
head elf?

93
00:10:43.894 --> 00:10:45.362
Me head elf?

94
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:51.402
What do you mean?

95
00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:54.506
Will you fire. Santa wants to...

96
00:10:54.605 --> 00:10:55.606
No.

97
00:11:00.077 --> 00:11:02.346
I think Santa needs to step back

98
00:11:02.446 --> 00:11:04.549
and let me handle Christmas.

99
00:11:08.285 --> 00:11:11.956
What's with the creepy laugh?

100
00:11:12.056 --> 00:11:13.057
Laugh with me.

101
00:11:17.596 --> 00:11:19.196
Okay.

102
00:11:44.288 --> 00:11:46.190
Here's your hot coco.

103
00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:50.427
I had to fire Winnie today.

104
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.466
Halfway through Christmas.

105
00:11:57.134 --> 00:11:59.036
But you fixed it.

106
00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:00.505
You are a magical man.

107
00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:05.009
Do you think I did the right
thing?

108
00:12:06.877 --> 00:12:10.381
I think that you did what you
had to do.

109
00:12:12.283 --> 00:12:17.188
Look. you make millions of
children's so happy and excited.

110
00:12:17.288 --> 00:12:18.657
But Kirra got coal.

111
00:12:20.391 --> 00:12:24.128
Exactly. we need prove
she's not head elf material.

112
00:12:25.896 --> 00:12:27.566
You need to do what's best.

113
00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:33.304
I'm not head elf material?

114
00:12:34.205 --> 00:12:35.640
I'll show them.

115
00:12:35.739 --> 00:12:37.007
Show them what. Winnie?

116
00:12:40.144 --> 00:12:41.546
Am I head elf material?

117
00:12:44.482 --> 00:12:46.817
Am I head elf material?

118
00:12:47.818 --> 00:12:49.420
Yeah. totally.

119
00:12:49.521 --> 00:12:51.855
I mean. I couldn't do it.

120
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:54.892
maybe I could.

121
00:12:55.993 --> 00:12:58.362
No. you couldn't.

122
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.433
Head of Elf Olie has got a
ring to it.

123
00:13:02.534 --> 00:13:03.602
There's no ring to it.

124
00:13:03.702 --> 00:13:05.102
it's a terrible idea.

125
00:13:08.272 --> 00:13:09.273
Follow me.

126
00:13:10.174 --> 00:13:11.175
Following.

127
00:13:20.784 --> 00:13:21.919
Olie in here.

128
00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:29.994
Watch the door.

129
00:13:30.094 --> 00:13:31.428
Tell me if anyone's coming.

130
00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:36.066
Okay boss.

131
00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:47.378
So they think they can fire
me.

132
00:13:48.979 --> 00:13:50.381
Clean up reindeer poop.

133
00:13:51.382 --> 00:13:52.383
come on.

134
00:13:55.052 --> 00:13:56.320
Ah. Winnie boss.

135
00:13:57.589 --> 00:13:58.590
What are you doing?

136
00:14:01.158 --> 00:14:03.561
Something I should have
done a long time ago.

137
00:14:08.966 --> 00:14:11.135
Are you thinking this through?

138
00:14:16.641 --> 00:14:17.374
Yes.

139
00:14:35.627 --> 00:14:37.094
This is great cocoa.

140
00:14:38.095 --> 00:14:39.196
I'm glad you like it.

141
00:14:53.812 --> 00:14:58.817
Oh. my face just went
numb.

142
00:14:59.049 --> 00:15:00.317
What's in this cocoa?

143
00:15:02.286 --> 00:15:05.457
You are tired.

144
00:15:05.557 --> 00:15:07.291
I think you could use a little
break.

145
00:15:07.391 --> 00:15:09.293
Why don't you take a week to
yourself.

146
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:12.062
I can't.

147
00:15:12.863 --> 00:15:14.532
There's just so much to do.

148
00:15:14.632 --> 00:15:16.133
I still need to find a head elf.

149
00:15:16.233 --> 00:15:17.134
Leave it to me.

150
00:15:17.234 --> 00:15:18.936
I'll make sure everything is
good.

151
00:15:19.036 --> 00:15:20.037
Don't worry.

152
00:15:20.137 --> 00:15:21.806
Oh. we've got elves.

153
00:15:21.905 --> 00:15:23.641
- But I just got...
- Yeah. no buts.

154
00:15:23.742 --> 00:15:25.275
I'll get the reindeer ready.

155
00:15:25.376 --> 00:15:27.579
trust me you'll feel years
younger.

156
00:15:28.713 --> 00:15:30.214
What would I do without you?

157
00:15:31.683 --> 00:15:33.651
You can finish your
cocoa.

158
00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:39.356
Thank you.

159
00:15:40.324 --> 00:15:42.059
And you're welcome.

160
00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:08.152
Winnie. can I have a word?

161
00:16:08.252 --> 00:16:09.621
Sure. why not.

162
00:16:09.721 --> 00:16:11.523
I hope you understand my
decision.

163
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.259
I understand that
you made a big mistake.

164
00:16:16.093 --> 00:16:17.928
but I am gonna go clean the
stables now.

165
00:16:18.028 --> 00:16:19.831
You don't have to right now.

166
00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.167
Besides. I'm gonna be gone for a
while.

167
00:16:23.267 --> 00:16:24.935
and Mrs. Claus will be in
charge.

168
00:16:26.003 --> 00:16:28.405
Oh really. where are you
going?

169
00:16:29.707 --> 00:16:32.276
It's a mini vacation.

170
00:16:34.712 --> 00:16:36.113
Well. have a nice break.

171
00:16:36.213 --> 00:16:37.981
and don't worry about this
place.

172
00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:40.217
I'm sure Mrs. Claus will be just
fine.

173
00:16:41.786 --> 00:16:43.488
Thank you Winnie.

174
00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:04.843
Okay. oh give a sec. okay?

175
00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:07.879
All right. look at you all set.

176
00:17:07.978 --> 00:17:08.847
ready to go?

177
00:17:08.947 --> 00:17:11.248
Are you sure you're gonna be
okay?

178
00:17:11.348 --> 00:17:14.619
Yes. now go get some much
needed rest.

179
00:17:14.719 --> 00:17:16.320
- But make sure to...
- No. I know.

180
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.121
- Oh and then.
- I know.

181
00:17:22.927 --> 00:17:25.262
We've got this all under
control.

182
00:17:28.365 --> 00:17:31.703
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a goodnight.

183
00:17:34.772 --> 00:17:38.476
Merry Christmas.
Santa Claus.

184
00:18:44.042 --> 00:18:49.047
Oh. oh. oh. what
happened?

185
00:18:50.748 --> 00:18:53.183
Oh..

186
00:18:59.724 --> 00:19:01.059
Oh. it's so red.

187
00:19:02.359 --> 00:19:03.962
Oh. I looks so young.

188
00:19:05.863 --> 00:19:09.099
Oh. what is happening.

189
00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:11.502
Oh. nutcracker.

190
00:19:25.783 --> 00:19:27.217
Oh. oh no. oh no.

191
00:19:28.553 --> 00:19:30.855

192
00:19:30.955 --> 00:19:34.626
Okay. wait. calm down.

193
00:19:34.726 --> 00:19:37.361

call home.

194
00:19:37.462 --> 00:19:39.897
I just really need to find my
hat.

195
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.806
Oh. found it.

196
00:20:06.758 --> 00:20:07.659
Hello.

197
00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:10.260
Hello. who's this?

198
00:20:11.763 --> 00:20:13.898
Mrs. Claus is not available
right now.

199
00:20:13.998 --> 00:20:16.134
She's a little tide up.

200
00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:19.103
And how are you feeling?

201
00:20:20.203 --> 00:20:22.674
Maybe a little backwards.

202
00:20:24.142 --> 00:20:26.376
Winnie. Winnie. what did you
do to me?

203
00:20:27.645 --> 00:20:29.714
I gave you the gift to youth.

204
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.018
What do you mean the gift of
youth?

205
00:20:37.855 --> 00:20:38.856
Oh no.

206
00:20:44.294 --> 00:20:48.132
Winnie. whatever you're
planning please rethink it.

207
00:20:50.034 --> 00:20:51.368
Goodbye. Santa.

208
00:21:00.578 --> 00:21:04.649
Please. what happened
to your Christmas spirit?

209
00:21:07.752 --> 00:21:10.387
Christmas is gonna be a
little different this year.

210
00:21:13.191 --> 00:21:16.561
Olie. take her away.

211
00:21:18.096 --> 00:21:19.097
Lock her up.

212
00:21:21.231 --> 00:21:22.232
Um. boss.

213
00:21:23.901 --> 00:21:26.170
Um. boss what?

214
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.082
Nothing. anything you say?

215
00:21:51.629 --> 00:21:53.498
Can I get everyone's
attention?

216
00:21:59.737 --> 00:22:00.738
Shut up?

217
00:22:04.374 --> 00:22:07.812
Olie. Olie there's no need for
that.

218
00:22:07.912 --> 00:22:08.913
Sorry boss.

219
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:13.951
Christmas is gonna
be different this year.

220
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:16.988
Christmas is gonna
be different this year.

221
00:22:18.222 --> 00:22:19.690
Olie?

222
00:22:19.791 --> 00:22:20.792
Yeah.

223
00:22:20.892 --> 00:22:22.359
What are you doing?

224
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.228
Coping what you said.

225
00:22:25.463 --> 00:22:26.464
Why?

226
00:22:27.131 --> 00:22:28.933
It sounds cool like echo.

227
00:22:36.174 --> 00:22:39.177
Santa's is no longer with us.

228
00:22:46.918 --> 00:22:48.886
Everyone go home.

229
00:22:48.986 --> 00:22:51.354
Grieve this horrible news.

230
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.760
As the head elf I'll take
over as the new Santa.

231
00:22:59.096 --> 00:23:00.264
Ho. ho. ho.

232
00:23:02.633 --> 00:23:05.503
Go. go. go. you heard the elf.

233
00:24:04.896 --> 00:24:06.564
What is happening?

234
00:24:28.719 --> 00:24:30.388
This the life. Olie.

235
00:24:39.563 --> 00:24:40.631
It's quiet.

236
00:24:42.066 --> 00:24:43.701
What about all the toys?

237
00:24:45.303 --> 00:24:46.304
What toys?

238
00:24:48.272 --> 00:24:50.041
The toys for the
kids.

239
00:24:51.375 --> 00:24:52.944
There'll be no toys.

240
00:24:53.945 --> 00:24:55.479
All the kids have been naughty.

241
00:24:59.116 --> 00:25:00.318
All of them?

242
00:25:02.286 --> 00:25:04.488
Yes. all of them.

243
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.742
What are you doing here?

244
00:25:24.842 --> 00:25:28.179
Hey. I was just wondering

245
00:25:28.279 --> 00:25:30.815
when we should all come back for
work

246
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.251
to get ready for Christmas?

247
00:25:35.653 --> 00:25:38.457
There's lots of work to do. toys
to make.

248
00:25:41.926 --> 00:25:42.927
And who are you?

249
00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:44.962
I'm Lovey?

250
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.398
Well Lobby.

251
00:25:47.498 --> 00:25:49.066
It's Lovey.

252
00:25:49.166 --> 00:25:52.370
Whatever. there'll be no toys
this year.

253
00:25:55.439 --> 00:25:56.440
No toys?

254
00:25:57.274 --> 00:25:58.843
You should be happy.

255
00:25:58.943 --> 00:26:01.312
Santa's worked you all so hard.

256
00:26:02.813 --> 00:26:04.648
We're elves it's what we do.

257
00:26:05.716 --> 00:26:07.184
Not anymore.

258
00:26:07.284 --> 00:26:09.053
Please go home Lobby.

259
00:26:09.153 --> 00:26:10.154
It's Lovey.

260
00:26:11.522 --> 00:26:13.791
Olie. will show you to the
door.

261
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.700
Santa would want us to make
toys.

262
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.668
Santa is gone.

263
00:26:26.471 --> 00:26:27.472
Good bye.

264
00:26:49.226 --> 00:26:51.095
Winnie. if that's you
please...

265
00:26:51.195 --> 00:26:52.263
Mrs. Claus.

266
00:26:56.535 --> 00:26:57.536
Yes.

267
00:26:58.936 --> 00:27:00.704
I know I'm not supposed to be
here.

268
00:27:00.805 --> 00:27:03.508
but Winnie has to be stopped.

269
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.520
What is she up to now?

270
00:27:15.619 --> 00:27:18.022
Winnie stopped all the
elves from making toys.

271
00:27:25.796 --> 00:27:26.897
Do you have my key?

272
00:27:28.099 --> 00:27:29.534
No. Winnie has it.

273
00:27:32.736 --> 00:27:37.408
There are two keys; I
have one and Santa has one.

274
00:27:38.309 --> 00:27:40.111
but when he came back
from delivering presents

275
00:27:40.211 --> 00:27:41.546
I couldn't find it anywhere.

276
00:27:41.645 --> 00:27:44.682
I think he dropped it somewhere.

277
00:27:44.782 --> 00:27:46.984
We need to find it.

278
00:27:47.084 --> 00:27:48.652
that's how Santa gets home.

279
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.621
The keys are magic.

280
00:27:50.721 --> 00:27:52.524
and so is his sleigh.

281
00:27:52.623 --> 00:27:53.724
How do I find it?

282
00:27:55.326 --> 00:27:57.328
There's a tracking device
inside.

283
00:27:57.428 --> 00:27:59.498
The tracker is in Santa's
office.

284
00:28:00.631 --> 00:28:05.636
Lovey. you are the only one
that can go into that office.

285
00:28:06.937 --> 00:28:09.740
and find out where that key is.

286
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.908
You know my name.

287
00:28:12.611 --> 00:28:13.612
Of course I do.

288
00:28:15.079 --> 00:28:17.181
This is very brave of you.

289
00:28:18.617 --> 00:28:19.618
Thank you.

290
00:28:21.486 --> 00:28:22.887
Okay. now go.

291
00:28:22.987 --> 00:28:25.089
Santa is running out of time.

292
00:28:25.189 --> 00:28:28.493
Oh. when you get into
the office call Santa

293
00:28:28.593 --> 00:28:29.760
on his hat phone.

294
00:28:30.629 --> 00:28:32.096
Oh. nutcracker.

295
00:28:33.664 --> 00:28:34.932
Santa always says that.

296
00:28:38.302 --> 00:28:40.371
Okay. now go and good luck.

297
00:28:41.305 --> 00:28:43.207
You can do this.

298
00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:45.544
I can do it.

299
00:29:24.081 --> 00:29:26.685
It's quiet without the elves.

300
00:29:27.818 --> 00:29:30.387
It's peaceful get used to it.

301
00:29:49.907 --> 00:29:51.576
Did you hear that?

302
00:29:53.511 --> 00:29:55.580
Probably just some of the
reindeer.

303
00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.081
Relax Olie.

304
00:30:23.941 --> 00:30:25.543
Okay. call Santa.

305
00:30:26.777 --> 00:30:27.811
Okay. call Santa.

Yes.

314
00:30:55.072 --> 00:30:56.173
It's Lovey.

315
00:30:56.273 --> 00:30:59.076

probably don't remember me.

318
00:31:02.813 --> 00:31:03.814
Yes.

319
00:31:05.684 --> 00:31:07.251
Anyway I'm calling you from
your office.

320
00:31:07.351 --> 00:31:09.688
Mrs. Claus wanted me to contact
you.

321
00:31:09.788 --> 00:31:12.089
Mrs. Claus. is she okay?

322
00:31:12.189 --> 00:31:13.891
Can I speak to her?

323
00:31:13.991 --> 00:31:17.161
She's not here but she's fine
for now.

324
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:19.664
Winnie has stopped all toy
development.

325
00:31:19.764 --> 00:31:21.932
and has sent all of the elves
away.

326
00:31:22.833 --> 00:31:24.736
I need you to listen
carefully.

327
00:31:24.835 --> 00:31:27.371
I am desantafying.

328
00:31:28.707 --> 00:31:31.208
It's much worse than that I'm
afraid.

329
00:31:31.308 --> 00:31:32.309
What do you mean?

330
00:31:34.945 --> 00:31:37.448
Winnie turn your time cane to
past.

331
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:41.619
So just turn it back to
present.

332
00:31:42.454 --> 00:31:45.457

key.

333
00:31:46.323 --> 00:31:47.324
A key.

334
00:31:48.225 --> 00:31:51.463
I don't have my key.
of course it's the key.

335
00:31:51.563 --> 00:31:54.365
Mrs. Claus says that she
thinks that you dropped it.

336
00:31:54.466 --> 00:31:57.034
but it has a tracker so I
can find out where it is.

337
00:31:57.134 --> 00:31:59.136
it's just gonna take me
a little bit of time.

338
00:32:02.707 --> 00:32:03.708
Someone's coming.

339
00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.116
Hello. Lovey. hello.

340
00:32:49.888 --> 00:32:50.889

341
00:32:53.123 --> 00:32:54.358
That was close.

342
00:32:56.694 --> 00:32:58.596
We need to hurry and find the
key.

343
00:33:00.532 --> 00:33:02.467

344
00:33:02.567 --> 00:33:04.334

369
00:36:12.422 --> 00:36:13.323
Santa?

370
00:36:13.423 --> 00:36:14.424
Yeah.

371
00:36:16.159 --> 00:36:17.160
Oh.

372
00:36:19.296 --> 00:36:20.965
What is everything okay?

373
00:36:21.065 --> 00:36:23.333
Is everything okay with you?

374
00:36:27.572 --> 00:36:29.474
I'm a teenager again.

375
00:36:32.342 --> 00:36:34.177
Oh no.

376
00:36:34.277 --> 00:36:35.312
It just happened.

377
00:36:36.179 --> 00:36:39.383
I got a strange feeling like
before

378
00:36:39.484 --> 00:36:42.252
at the time I was talking to
Mrs. Claus at the North Pole.

379
00:36:44.287 --> 00:36:46.189
The time cane lit up.

380
00:36:46.289 --> 00:36:47.892
We're running out of time.

381
00:36:47.992 --> 00:36:50.561
Who knows when it's gonna happen
again.

382
00:36:50.662 --> 00:36:52.162
You've got to get that key.

383
00:36:52.262 --> 00:36:55.833
It's at 1313 Oakwood Street.

384
00:36:56.668 --> 00:36:58.402
It's Kirra's house.

385
00:36:58.503 --> 00:37:01.271
Right. I must have dropped
it when I was leaving.

386
00:37:02.172 --> 00:37:04.108
I'll just go ask for it back.

387
00:37:04.976 --> 00:37:07.779
Ah. I don't think it's gonna
be easy.

388
00:37:07.879 --> 00:37:10.247
I mean. you're a teenager.

389
00:37:10.347 --> 00:37:11.616
and I'm guessing you probably
don't look

390
00:37:11.716 --> 00:37:13.051
like Santa Claus right now.

391
00:37:16.988 --> 00:37:18.188
Someone's coming.

392
00:37:18.288 --> 00:37:19.322
I gotta go.

393
00:37:19.423 --> 00:37:22.126
Good luck. Santa. and
keep your hat close. okay?

394
00:37:30.134 --> 00:37:32.335
Okay. I'm Santa.

395
00:37:33.538 --> 00:37:34.672
Hi. I'm Santa. no.

396
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:40.144
Hello. I'm Sant. no.

397
00:37:41.512 --> 00:37:42.513
Oh. man.

398
00:37:44.816 --> 00:37:46.818
Hey man. it's Easter.

399
00:37:46.918 --> 00:37:48.186
Gotta miss the.

400
00:37:49.654 --> 00:37:50.387
Do you remember me?

401
00:37:50.488 --> 00:37:51.923
I've been in your house.

402
00:37:52.023 --> 00:37:54.892
No. that is gonna creep her out.

403
00:37:58.428 --> 00:37:59.997
No one's gonna believe that I'm
Santa.

404
00:38:14.612 --> 00:38:15.613
Mrs. Claus.

405
00:38:18.216 --> 00:38:19.984
it's me Lovey.

406
00:38:20.084 --> 00:38:21.853
Did you locate the key?

407
00:38:21.953 --> 00:38:23.621
I did and I told Santa about
it.

408
00:38:23.721 --> 00:38:25.322
He's working on it.

409
00:38:25.422 --> 00:38:26.891
There's just one problem.

410
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:29.527
What is it?

411
00:38:29.627 --> 00:38:32.262
- Well...
- Okay. Lovey hide.

412
00:38:36.433 --> 00:38:37.468
Who you talking to?

413
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.640
I was just singing a song.

414
00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.743
There isn't a whole lot to
do down here all by yourself.

415
00:38:52.617 --> 00:38:55.486
What happened to you. Olie?

416
00:38:56.954 --> 00:38:58.456
Why are you doing this?

417
00:39:02.593 --> 00:39:03.828
You can stop it.

418
00:39:05.463 --> 00:39:09.066
You can be the one that saves
Christmas.

419
00:39:12.103 --> 00:39:15.006
You know if Santa doesn't get
back here by Christmas Eve

420
00:39:16.974 --> 00:39:19.944
that is the end of Christmas.

421
00:39:26.984 --> 00:39:29.153
Olie. Mrs. Claus?

422
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:33.958
I'll take it from here.

423
00:39:38.162 --> 00:39:41.599
Mrs. Claus. you talk too much.

424
00:39:43.333 --> 00:39:48.306
Winnie. after everything
that Santa has done for you.

425
00:39:48.973 --> 00:39:50.440
Done for me?

426
00:39:51.509 --> 00:39:53.044
Santa gets all the credit.

427
00:39:53.945 --> 00:39:56.180
but who gets everything done?

428
00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.281
Me.

429
00:39:59.517 --> 00:40:02.520
Who's made this place what it
is?

430
00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.621
Me.

431
00:40:05.556 --> 00:40:07.758
Santa has had his time.

432
00:40:07.859 --> 00:40:09.827
Now his time has come to an end.

433
00:40:13.531 --> 00:40:15.132
You have said it all wrong.

434
00:40:16.834 --> 00:40:19.070
You can still undo this.

435
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.771
This can't be undone.

436
00:40:33.985 --> 00:40:37.221
it's all right
Lovey you can come out now.

437
00:40:41.092 --> 00:40:42.425
Winnie is not gonna stop.

438
00:40:44.729 --> 00:40:46.731
Well. let's hope Santa finds
that key.

439
00:41:40.718 --> 00:41:41.786
Nice costume.

440
00:41:44.588 --> 00:41:45.589
Mine.

441
00:41:46.757 --> 00:41:47.758
Yes yours.

442
00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:55.366
Merry Halloween.

443
00:41:55.466 --> 00:41:57.068
Sorry. happy Halloween.

444
00:41:57.168 --> 00:41:59.937
That's funny
because you're Santa.

445
00:42:01.072 --> 00:42:03.107
Yeah. I am Santa.

446
00:42:03.207 --> 00:42:06.410
I've seen you around town
when did you move here?

447
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.579
Well. no. I'm actually from
North Pole.

448
00:42:09.647 --> 00:42:11.349
That's funny again.

449
00:42:11.449 --> 00:42:13.684
You must really love
Christmas to be dressed

450
00:42:13.784 --> 00:42:15.019
like that for Halloween.

451
00:42:18.022 --> 00:42:19.724
Look. I'm actually
looking for something.

452
00:42:19.824 --> 00:42:21.726
and I think you'll be able to
help me.

453
00:42:21.826 --> 00:42:23.761
Oh. what?

454
00:42:23.861 --> 00:42:27.264
Okay. this is gonna sound
completely crazy. but here goes.

455
00:42:27.365 --> 00:42:28.366
Okay.

456
00:42:29.033 --> 00:42:30.301
I really am Santa.

457
00:42:32.003 --> 00:42:34.572
and I keep getting younger and
younger.

458
00:42:34.672 --> 00:42:37.241
and by Christmas Eve
I'm gonna cease to exist

459
00:42:37.341 --> 00:42:38.209
along with Christmas.

460
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:41.278
That's not really funny
anymore.

461
00:42:41.379 --> 00:42:43.482
Look. I know it sounds
completely crazy.

462
00:42:45.116 --> 00:42:46.751
I have to go.

463
00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:48.953
Kirra. just please wait.

464
00:42:49.053 --> 00:42:50.054
just hear me out.

465
00:42:52.491 --> 00:42:54.325
I didn't tell you my name.

466
00:42:55.393 --> 00:42:56.761
How do you know my name?

467
00:42:56.861 --> 00:42:58.796
Have you been watching me?

468
00:42:58.896 --> 00:43:01.732
No. maybe just a little bit.

469
00:43:01.832 --> 00:43:04.602
- Can you please leave.
- I just need the key.

470
00:43:04.702 --> 00:43:07.071
The key. how do you know about
the key?

471
00:43:08.339 --> 00:43:10.041
It's key to know the North
Pole.

472
00:43:10.141 --> 00:43:11.909
Did you break into my house?

473
00:43:12.009 --> 00:43:13.010
No.

474
00:43:14.078 --> 00:43:15.246
Like I've been in your house.

475
00:43:15.346 --> 00:43:16.680
You know how this sounds?

476
00:43:17.848 --> 00:43:20.751
Yeah. like really bad.

477
00:43:20.851 --> 00:43:23.087
Please go and leave me alone.

478
00:43:49.013 --> 00:43:50.347
That was mean.

479
00:43:59.924 --> 00:44:01.692
You shouldn't be playing with
that.

480
00:44:02.893 --> 00:44:04.095
Don't ruin my fun.

481
00:44:11.102 --> 00:44:13.070
You're basically causing
earthquakes.

482
00:44:23.447 --> 00:44:25.883
Hello. it's me Santa Claus.

483
00:44:27.985 --> 00:44:29.620
It's upside down.

484
00:44:37.728 --> 00:44:41.065
So turn everything off and...

485
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:47.572
lock it up.

486
00:44:47.671 --> 00:44:48.672
And then...

487
00:44:56.013 --> 00:44:57.014
that's it.

488
00:44:58.649 --> 00:45:03.654
Oh. and try not to be
so sad around Winnie.

489
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:06.257
She aint gonna like it.

490
00:45:06.357 --> 00:45:09.594
- Okay.
- She's the boss now.

491
00:45:42.293 --> 00:45:45.129
What?

492
00:45:47.532 --> 00:45:48.799
Kirra believes.

493
00:45:50.034 --> 00:45:53.204
Why else would she take
the key on Christmas Eve?

494
00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:59.276
Above.

495
00:45:59.376 --> 00:46:00.411
Where?

496
00:46:00.512 --> 00:46:01.646
Move forward. forward. forward.

497
00:46:01.745 --> 00:46:03.781
Okay I got him. I got him now.

498
00:46:03.881 --> 00:46:04.982
Next.

499
00:46:05.082 --> 00:46:06.083
Next one is on me.

500
00:46:07.251 --> 00:46:08.252
Thank you.

501
00:46:09.554 --> 00:46:12.256
One more. one more. I want my
cookies

502
00:46:12.356 --> 00:46:13.791
with no raisins this year.

503
00:46:15.527 --> 00:46:16.727
We got 'em. okay.

504
00:46:17.662 --> 00:46:20.164
All right. no. no. you let me
die.

505
00:46:21.732 --> 00:46:23.734
Yeah. I'm talking to you.

506
00:46:23.834 --> 00:46:25.604
I'm putting you in the naughty
list.

507
00:46:37.214 --> 00:46:40.451
Come on Santa. pick up.
pick up. there's still time.

508
00:46:47.024 --> 00:46:49.126
Please don't hang up. don't hang
up.

509
00:46:49.226 --> 00:46:49.960
Where?

510
00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.061
Oh.

511
00:46:52.229 --> 00:46:54.031
I'm here. Lovey hello.

512
00:46:54.131 --> 00:46:56.501
- Lovey?
- Hi Santa.

513
00:46:56.601 --> 00:46:59.203
So the time cane hasn't gone
off in the last couple months.

514
00:46:59.303 --> 00:47:00.337
and it's Christmas Eve.

515
00:47:00.437 --> 00:47:02.106
and I'm pretty sure
you're still a teenager.

516
00:47:02.206 --> 00:47:04.208
and you haven't found the key?

517
00:47:04.308 --> 00:47:06.310
Yeah. I'm still a teenager.

518
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:09.380
and Kirra won't believe that I'm
Santa.

519
00:47:09.481 --> 00:47:10.781
I mean. look at me.

520
00:47:14.586 --> 00:47:16.820
I can't see you. Santa.

521
00:47:18.389 --> 00:47:21.091
Midnight tonight Christmas
is gonna be gone forever.

522
00:47:22.059 --> 00:47:24.061
You can't give up now.

523
00:47:24.161 --> 00:47:27.699
I couldn't gat Kirra to
believe me for a whole year.

524
00:47:27.798 --> 00:47:29.833
How am I gonna do it in 10
hours?

525
00:47:29.933 --> 00:47:31.770
The key is on the move.

526
00:47:33.003 --> 00:47:36.708
Just tell Mrs. Claus that.
wait what?

527
00:47:36.807 --> 00:47:38.042
Kirra must have it with her.

528
00:47:38.142 --> 00:47:39.678
It's always been in the house.

529
00:47:39.778 --> 00:47:42.313
You have to try again there's
still time.

530
00:47:44.482 --> 00:47:45.983
It's too late Lovey.

531
00:47:46.083 --> 00:47:48.486
It's never too late Santa.

00:47:48.586 --> 00:47:51.088

533
00:47:57.762 --> 00:47:58.763

Yeah. I'm here.

535
00:48:02.701 --> 00:48:03.834
You can do it. Santa.

536
00:48:09.306 --> 00:48:10.307
Okay.

537
00:48:12.943 --> 00:48:14.311
Let's save Christmas.

538
00:48:16.347 --> 00:48:17.582
Yeah.

539
00:48:48.513 --> 00:48:50.047
Can I borrow your skateboard?

540
00:48:50.147 --> 00:48:51.750
I need to get to the North Pole.

541
00:48:54.586 --> 00:48:55.720
Look. if I don't get to the
North Pole

542
00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.388

543

00:49:07.599 --> 00:49:09.400
Okay sweet. thank you so much
Rayne.

545
00:49:10.502 --> 00:49:11.469
Merry Christmas.

546
00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:13.571
Tell Lorren I said thank

547
00:49:19.677 --> 00:49:22.112
Hey. where's my skateboard.

548
00:49:22.212 --> 00:49:23.548
Santa took it.

549
00:49:27.619 --> 00:49:28.620
What the?

550
00:50:26.678 --> 00:50:28.145
All right. I'm in position.

551
00:50:37.522 --> 00:50:38.923
All right. I see her.

552
00:50:51.936 --> 00:50:53.170
Hey.

553
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:55.239
Who's that. do you know him?

554
00:50:55.339 --> 00:50:56.508
We met once.

555
00:50:57.642 --> 00:50:59.076
Are you waiting for me?

556
00:50:59.176 --> 00:51:02.179
No. yeah. maybe.

557
00:51:02.279 --> 00:51:03.280
That's creepy.

558
00:51:04.649 --> 00:51:06.818
Look. can I just talk
to you for one minute?

559
00:51:08.553 --> 00:51:09.888
Can you give us a second?

560
00:51:09.988 --> 00:51:11.321
Sure. I'll be over there.

561
00:51:13.123 --> 00:51:14.759
Why are you following me?

562
00:51:14.859 --> 00:51:18.630
Look. I know all of this
sounds crazy.

563
00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:20.230
but I really am Santa Claus.

564
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:23.768
and I don't know how much
longer I have as this age.

565
00:51:23.868 --> 00:51:27.404
I just. I know at midnight
that's it.

566
00:51:27.505 --> 00:51:28.806
so I just need the key.

567
00:51:28.907 --> 00:51:31.074
and then I'll leave you alone.

568
00:51:31.174 --> 00:51:32.577
I lost it.

569
00:51:32.677 --> 00:51:34.411
No you didn't you have it on
you.

570
00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:37.582
How did you know that?

571
00:51:37.682 --> 00:51:38.783
Lovey tracked it?

572
00:51:38.883 --> 00:51:40.785
She put a tracking device in it.

573
00:51:40.885 --> 00:51:43.320
- Lovey?
- Yes. she's one of my elves.

574
00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:44.556
Elves?

575
00:51:44.656 --> 00:51:47.458
Nice try Santa. but if you
don't stop following me.

576
00:51:47.559 --> 00:51:48.826
I will call the police.

577
00:52:09.948 --> 00:52:12.917
"Kirra the Christmas elf."
that's it.

578
00:52:25.362 --> 00:52:26.396
Hi everyone.

579
00:52:26.497 --> 00:52:29.601

584
00:52:36.074 --> 00:52:37.709
and we have music.

585
00:52:37.809 --> 00:52:39.644
Who doesn't love music?

586
00:52:40.845 --> 00:52:44.515
So put your hands together
for The North Sound.

587

606
00:53:29.861 --> 00:53:31.095
'Cause I asked you to stop.

607
00:53:31.194 --> 00:53:33.498
Look. I know how hard it
is to believe that I'm Santa.

608
00:53:33.598 --> 00:53:34.932
but I really am.

609
00:53:35.033 --> 00:53:36.701
You need to leave.

610
00:53:36.801 --> 00:53:39.202
Look your grandmother used
to write children's books.

00:53:42.707 --> 00:53:44.042
"Kirra the Christmas Elf."

612
00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:47.111
Who told you that?

613
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:48.479
That was you?

614
00:53:50.048 --> 00:53:53.518
No. it can't you're so young.

615
00:53:53.618 --> 00:53:57.187
Look. I need that
key.

616
00:53:57.287 --> 00:53:59.457
or else Christmas is
gonna be gone forever.

617
00:54:01.826 --> 00:54:03.061
I'll be right back.

618
00:54:03.161 --> 00:54:04.162

Yes. I really am Santa.

623
00:54:16.306 --> 00:54:18.743
I'm sorry. Santa. I didn't
know.

624
00:54:18.843 --> 00:54:21.079
It's okay just I need that
key.

625
00:54:27.217 --> 00:54:28.218
Thank you.

626
00:54:29.386 --> 00:54:30.387
I'm coming too.

627
00:54:31.989 --> 00:54:33.223
No. you can't.

628
00:54:39.229 --> 00:54:40.430
No one will know I'm gone.

629
00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:42.867
isn't time different in the
North Pole like it slows down.

630
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:47.304
- Yeah. but...
- I'm coming.

631
00:54:47.404 --> 00:54:48.172
Let me help.

632
00:54:58.348 --> 00:54:59.550
Fine. okay.

633
00:55:32.282 --> 00:55:36.386
Wow. so this is the workshop?

634
00:55:39.322 --> 00:55:41.225
It's the empty workshop.

635
00:55:41.324 --> 00:55:42.994
Where are all the elves?

636
00:55:43.961 --> 00:55:45.463
Where's Winnie?

637
00:55:45.563 --> 00:55:47.465
Is that Winnie?

638
00:55:51.502 --> 00:55:55.072
Well. I didn't expect this.

639
00:55:56.274 --> 00:55:58.509
You're not gonna get
away with this. Winnie.

640
00:55:58.609 --> 00:55:59.610
Oh.

641
00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:05.550
I'm getting that strange
feeling again.

642
00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:06.684
I think it's too late.

643
00:56:06.784 --> 00:56:07.785
Get the key.

644
00:56:18.696 --> 00:56:20.798
Why are you doing this?

645
00:56:21.799 --> 00:56:23.501
Who are you?

646
00:56:23.601 --> 00:56:26.204
Look at the little guy.

647
00:56:26.304 --> 00:56:27.638
Oh nutcracker.

648
00:56:33.277 --> 00:56:36.881
I'm Kirra and you don't have
to do this.

649
00:56:38.182 --> 00:56:41.285
Wrong. I want to do this.

650
00:56:42.119 --> 00:56:44.789
You chose the wrong day to
come visit the North Pole.

651
00:56:47.525 --> 00:56:49.126
Lock them both with Mrs. Claus.

652
00:56:50.862 --> 00:56:52.697
Let them say goodbye.

653
00:56:54.198 --> 00:56:55.633
You did it boss.

654
00:56:58.703 --> 00:57:01.072
You ended Christmas.

655
00:57:06.544 --> 00:57:07.945
I did it.

656
00:57:08.045 --> 00:57:10.815
I now own the North Pole.

657
00:57:14.685 --> 00:57:17.054
Don't you mean we own North
Pole.

658
00:57:20.057 --> 00:57:21.391
I. we. whatever.

659
00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:25.062
You're my assistant.

660
00:57:25.162 --> 00:57:26.330
You assist me.

661
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.214
Oh nutcracker.

662
00:58:42.173 --> 00:58:44.008
Goodbye Santa.

663
00:58:44.108 --> 00:58:46.010
Christmas can still be saved.

664
00:58:48.079 --> 00:58:49.914
We are stuck in this place.

665
00:58:51.649 --> 00:58:53.751
I have searched every inch of
this cell.

666
00:58:55.119 --> 00:58:56.120
there's no way out.

667
00:58:58.022 --> 00:58:59.924
But I have the key.

668
00:59:00.024 --> 00:59:01.625
And we are in here.

669
00:59:03.661 --> 00:59:07.365
I'm sorry. I'm afraid it's too
late.

670
00:59:17.875 --> 00:59:18.843
I'll do it.

671
00:59:20.111 --> 00:59:21.112
Lovey.

672
00:59:22.013 --> 00:59:23.547
I can do it.

673
00:59:23.647 --> 00:59:25.516
Give me the key we don't have
much time.

674
00:59:25.616 --> 00:59:27.318
Yes. it's okay. give her the
key.

675
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:34.291
Here.

676
00:59:37.161 --> 00:59:37.928
Go.

677
00:59:46.203 --> 00:59:48.072
We still have a chance. right?

678
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:53.644
Let's hope so.

679
01:00:00.851 --> 01:00:02.019
Not so fast.

680
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:11.362
Olie. you have to let me
pass there's no more time.

681
01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:16.700
No matter what you're
thinking do the right thing.

682
01:00:17.601 --> 01:00:19.770
I have to get to the
time candy cane. okay.

683
01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:21.238
there's no more time.

684
01:00:24.041 --> 01:00:26.210
Go now I ain't see you.

685
01:00:27.445 --> 01:00:28.547
Thank you Olie.

686
01:00:31.182 --> 01:00:32.783
Not so fast.

687
01:00:34.519 --> 01:00:35.520
Winnie hi.

688
01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:40.958
Nice try Lobby.

689
01:00:41.058 --> 01:00:42.126
It's Lovey.

690
01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.596
It doesn't matter.

691
01:00:45.696 --> 01:00:47.031
Olie. I saw you.

692
01:00:51.802 --> 01:00:53.938
You disappoint me.

693
01:00:54.038 --> 01:00:56.674
You're gonna destroy
Christmas.

694
01:00:56.774 --> 01:00:58.776
We're elves we need Christmas.

695
01:01:01.645 --> 01:01:02.646
Give me the key.

696
01:01:04.815 --> 01:01:05.816
What key?

697
01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:09.887
I'm gonna ask you one more
time.

698
01:01:09.987 --> 01:01:11.255
There are two keys.

699
01:01:12.723 --> 01:01:13.724
How stupid of me.

700
01:01:14.493 --> 01:01:16.794
I totally forgot about the
second key.

701
01:01:20.731 --> 01:01:22.501
Now give me the other key.

702
01:01:35.446 --> 01:01:36.947
Christmas is mine.

703
01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:43.754
Olie. you are just not cut out
for this.

704
01:01:43.854 --> 01:01:46.924
Now I have both the keys
and there is nothing any

705
01:01:47.024 --> 01:01:48.292
of you can do about

706
01:01:50.629 --> 01:01:51.630
Winnie?

707
01:01:53.864 --> 01:01:55.366
Are you sure you have the key?

708
01:01:58.603 --> 01:02:00.171
What are you talking about?

709
01:02:01.172 --> 01:02:02.273
Look again.

710
01:02:15.886 --> 01:02:18.355
That looks delicious.

711
01:02:18.456 --> 01:02:19.457
No.

712
01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.060
I don't know what.

713
01:02:24.228 --> 01:02:27.097
I think it's too late for you.
Winnie.

714
01:02:27.198 --> 01:02:28.533
Merry Christmas.

715
01:02:29.733 --> 01:02:32.069
No. Lobby.

716
01:03:41.038 --> 01:03:42.940
No. what have you done?

717
01:03:55.886 --> 01:03:57.388
Holy nutcracker.

718
01:04:04.496 --> 01:04:05.497
So cool.

719
01:04:07.331 --> 01:04:10.067
Welcome back Santa Claus.

720
01:04:10.167 --> 01:04:13.370
That was the craziest
experience of my life.

721
01:04:13.471 --> 01:04:15.906
- Are you okay?
- I'm Fine.

722
01:04:17.107 --> 01:04:18.175
Sorry to interrupt.

723
01:04:18.275 --> 01:04:21.345
but how are we gonna get out of
here?

724
01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:25.750
Well. if I remember correctly.

725
01:04:28.986 --> 01:04:30.755
What are you doing?

726
01:04:36.927 --> 01:04:40.799
Santa always has a trick
up his sleeve.

727
01:05:02.453 --> 01:05:03.420
That was amazing Santa.

728
01:05:03.521 --> 01:05:06.857
That was amazing.
wasn't it?

729
01:05:15.866 --> 01:05:18.068
Santa. welcome back.

730
01:05:18.168 --> 01:05:19.169
I'm back.

731
01:05:20.237 --> 01:05:22.339
Santa. I can explain.

732
01:05:23.307 --> 01:05:27.044
see. Winnie she hi...

733
01:05:27.144 --> 01:05:29.213
Stopped talking Olie.

734
01:05:29.313 --> 01:05:32.049
go. leave the North Pole.

735
01:05:32.149 --> 01:05:35.520
- Santa but I...
- Olie. listen to Santa.

736
01:05:40.658 --> 01:05:41.693
Where is Winnie?

737
01:05:49.601 --> 01:05:50.602
Santa?

738
01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:53.036
It worked.

739
01:05:54.071 --> 01:05:55.239
Yes it did. Lovey.

740
01:05:56.106 --> 01:05:57.074
Thank you.

741
01:05:57.174 --> 01:05:58.342
Olie helped me.

742
01:05:58.442 --> 01:05:59.477
If it wasn't for Olie

743
01:05:59.577 --> 01:06:01.679
I never would have gotten past
Winnie.

744
01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.681
Olie gave me a chocolate
key and we switched it.

745
01:06:03.782 --> 01:06:05.717
and Winnie he fell for it.

746
01:06:06.751 --> 01:06:11.589
Lovey stands still and watch
this.

747
01:06:12.624 --> 01:06:13.357
Okay.

748
01:06:47.492 --> 01:06:48.827
Olie?

749
01:06:48.927 --> 01:06:50.127
Yes boss.

750
01:06:50.227 --> 01:06:51.729
Call me Santa.

751
01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:54.164
Okay boss. I mean Santa.

752
01:06:54.264 --> 01:06:56.333
Take Winnie to the candy king
jail.

753
01:06:57.902 --> 01:06:58.903
Yes boss.

754
01:07:03.106 --> 01:07:04.107
Let's go.

755
01:07:07.946 --> 01:07:10.314
My friends are never gonna
believe this.

756
01:07:12.817 --> 01:07:15.887
Lovey. call in the elves.

757
01:07:15.986 --> 01:07:17.555
Already done Santa.

758
01:07:27.297 --> 01:07:28.700
Yeah. welcome back Santa.

759
01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.534
This is fantastic.

760
01:07:29.634 --> 01:07:30.367
I love Santa.

761
01:07:30.468 --> 01:07:32.102
it's just amazing to be in here.

762
01:07:32.202 --> 01:07:34.438
Hey. you can just breath.
okay?

763
01:07:34.539 --> 01:07:38.342
Well. there's only one
more thing left to do.

764
01:07:38.442 --> 01:07:43.447
Lovey. you are my new head elf.

765
01:07:43.848 --> 01:07:45.048
Really?

766
01:07:45.148 --> 01:07:46.383
You earned it. Lovey.

767
01:07:47.652 --> 01:07:50.020
It was very brave what you
did. Lovey.

768
01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.388
I almost gave up.

769
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:54.659
Hi. Santa's Merry Christmas.

770
01:07:57.327 --> 01:07:59.864
Hello. Merry Christmas.

771
01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:03.100
Aw. she's so cute.

772
01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:07.539
She's actually 105
years old.

773
01:08:07.639 --> 01:08:10.407
Oh. still cute
though.

774
01:08:16.548 --> 01:08:18.650
Santa. we've got a lot of work
to do.

775
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:22.921
Oh yes. we do
have a lot of work to do.

776
01:08:25.657 --> 01:08:27.625
Welcome back elves.

777
01:08:27.725 --> 01:08:31.228
I'm sorry. I've been gone for
a while but I am back now.

778
01:08:31.328 --> 01:08:33.531
and we are gonna have to work
harder

779
01:08:33.631 --> 01:08:36.000
than we've ever worked before.

780
01:08:36.099 --> 01:08:38.736
but that's okay because I
believe

781
01:08:38.836 --> 01:08:41.204
in every single one of you.

782
01:08:42.072 --> 01:08:45.877
Now let me introduce you
to our new head elf. Lovey.

783
01:08:48.078 --> 01:08:49.413
Take it away Lovey.

784
01:08:52.784 --> 01:08:54.552
Okay. thanks Santa.

785
01:08:55.553 --> 01:08:56.621
Thanks. Mrs. Class.

786
01:08:59.222 --> 01:09:01.593
Okay elves. let's get to work.

787
01:09:01.693 --> 01:09:04.829
Let's make this a Christmas to
remember.

788
01:09:04.929 --> 01:09:05.964
Let's save Christmas.

789
01:09:12.971 --> 01:09:14.171
What can I do?

790
01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:17.475
Today. you are Kirra. the
Christmas elf.

791
01:10:08.158 --> 01:10:10.695
This is all you. Lovey.

792
01:10:10.795 --> 01:10:11.796
Well done.

793
01:10:12.597 --> 01:10:14.766
Thank you for believing
in me. Mrs. Claus.

794
01:10:17.001 --> 01:10:18.002
You're welcome.

795
01:10:19.003 --> 01:10:22.205
but I always knew you could do
it.

796
01:11:02.046 --> 01:11:04.982
Did you actually think you
could ruin Christmas. Winnie?

797
01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:11.823
You almost did.

798
01:11:14.158 --> 01:11:18.261
Well. try to have a Merry
Christmas.

799
01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:34.212
Not bad better than a real
elf.

800
01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:37.682
Don't tell them I said that.

801
01:11:37.782 --> 01:11:38.816
Okay. you're ready.

802
01:11:38.916 --> 01:11:40.350
Do you have your key?

803
01:11:42.285 --> 01:11:44.387
Ops. I do not.

804
01:11:46.124 --> 01:11:47.925
Santa. here is your key.

805
01:11:49.727 --> 01:11:53.131
There it is.

806
01:11:53.231 --> 01:11:55.933
Look. I want you back
you back here Santa Claus.

807
01:11:56.033 --> 01:11:57.602
so stop losing it.

808
01:12:00.905 --> 01:12:02.173
Thank you. Kirra.

809
01:12:02.272 --> 01:12:04.475
Thank you for believing in me.

810
01:12:04.575 --> 01:12:06.878
I'm sorry it took me
so long to believe you.

811
01:12:06.978 --> 01:12:08.311
It's okay.

812
01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:09.881
It must have been a little
weird to have a teenager go.

813
01:12:09.981 --> 01:12:12.650
"Hey. hey. I'm Santa Claus."

814
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:15.352
Just for the record you
were a pretty cool teenager.

815
01:12:15.452 --> 01:12:16.187
Thank you Kirra.

816
01:12:16.286 --> 01:12:18.222
Thank you for everything.

817
01:12:18.321 --> 01:12:19.422
Now okay.

818
01:12:19.524 --> 01:12:22.126
Look. it's time to go and
do what you do. Santa Claus.

819
01:12:23.494 --> 01:12:25.362
Thank you. everyone.

820
01:12:25.463 --> 01:12:29.801
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night.

821
01:12:31.836 --> 01:12:33.871
Merry Christmas. Santa.

822
01:12:33.971 --> 01:12:36.406
Merry Christmas. Mrs. Claus.

823
01:12:36.507 --> 01:12:37.842
Merry Christmas. Kirra.

824
01:12:38.976 --> 01:12:40.511
Now. it's time to get you home.

825
01:12:44.782 --> 01:12:46.984
This is gonna feel a little
weird.

826
01:13:52.216 --> 01:13:53.217
Santa?

827
01:13:55.152 --> 01:13:57.054
I knew you wouldn't forget me.

828
01:13:57.154 --> 01:13:58.322
Forget you?

829
01:13:58.421 --> 01:14:01.792
How can I forget you. you saved
Christmas.

830
01:14:01.893 --> 01:14:04.228
Your elf saved Christmas
I just had the key

831
01:14:05.395 --> 01:14:07.064
for a long time.

832
01:14:07.164 --> 01:14:08.633
I'm sorry I didn't believe you
sooner

833
01:14:08.733 --> 01:14:10.635
it just didn't make sense.

834
01:14:10.735 --> 01:14:12.336
It all worked in the end.

835
01:14:13.204 --> 01:14:16.607
Come to think of it walk
around all year long

836
01:14:16.707 --> 01:14:19.110
with a Santa suit.

837
01:14:19.210 --> 01:14:20.978
probably did look a little nuts.

838
01:14:21.078 --> 01:14:23.781
Yeah. kind of.

839
01:14:23.881 --> 01:14:26.183
And I see you haven't
put out the presence yet.

840
01:14:26.284 --> 01:14:27.652
Do you need some help?

841
01:14:27.752 --> 01:14:30.154
Oh my goodness. I would
love that. thank you.

842
01:15:01.419 --> 01:15:03.154
This isn't shaped like coal.

843
01:15:06.891 --> 01:15:07.892
You can open it.

844
01:15:08.926 --> 01:15:09.660
Really?

845
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.164
It's a gift from me to you.

846
01:15:13.264 --> 01:15:14.465
Thank you Santa.

847
01:15:28.913 --> 01:15:30.748
My grandma's book?

848
01:15:33.651 --> 01:15:35.820
My grandma's book.

849
01:15:43.327 --> 01:15:44.562
How?

850
01:15:44.662 --> 01:15:45.663
Magic.

851
01:15:47.131 --> 01:15:49.900
So cool. my grandmother would
read this

852
01:15:50.001 --> 01:15:51.936
to us every Christmas.

853
01:15:52.036 --> 01:15:53.437
I loved it so much.

854
01:15:54.538 --> 01:15:55.940
She was so great.

855
01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.209
Yes. she was.

856
01:15:58.309 --> 01:16:00.611
This means so much to me.
Santa.

857
01:16:00.711 --> 01:16:01.612
Thank you.

858
01:16:01.712 --> 01:16:02.713
You're welcome.

859
01:16:04.949 --> 01:16:06.951
Well. I best be going.

860
01:16:07.051 --> 01:16:10.621
a lot more presents to
deliver. a lot more.

861
01:16:12.023 --> 01:16:13.024
One more thing.

862
01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:17.661
The key.

863
01:16:19.864 --> 01:16:23.234
Well. not the key. but a key.

864
01:16:24.969 --> 01:16:26.737
A little less shrinking.

865
01:16:26.837 --> 01:16:28.339
maybe a little younger though.

866
01:16:30.674 --> 01:16:32.176
Man. I was good at skating.

867
01:16:34.745 --> 01:16:36.547
Well. I better get going.

868
01:16:36.647 --> 01:16:37.681
Merry Christmas.

869
01:16:38.749 --> 01:16:40.485
Merry Christmas Santa.

870
01:16:40.584 --> 01:16:42.286
Thank you for everything.

871
01:16:42.386 --> 01:16:44.989
Remember. never stop
believing.

872
01:16:46.023 --> 01:16:47.825
I won't Santa. I won't.
