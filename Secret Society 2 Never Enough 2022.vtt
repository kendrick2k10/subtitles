3
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:19.281
- Michael. you don't know how
good it is to hear your voice.

4
00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:24.306
- Celess. I. I heard about
what happened to Tina

5
00:00:24.306 --> 00:00:25.473
and I'm sorry.

6
00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:30.421
I'm sorry that what happened to her

7
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:32.934
didn't happen to you too.

8
00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.171
I mean. don't you think y'all deserve

9
00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:37.447
to be burning in hell together?

10
00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:38.551
Matter of fact. why don't you dig a hole

11
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:42.344
next to where she's buried
and throw yourself in.

12
00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:46.057
I'll cover it myself. and
feel good about it too.

13
00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:28.580
You know that shit you learned

14
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.838
about sticks and stones
may break your bones.

15
00:01:30.838 --> 00:01:33.441
but words will never hurt you?

16
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.691
That's a motherfucking lie.

17
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:41.601
Khalil couldn't kill me
with a Smith and Wesson.

18
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.281
but Michael did with his words.

19
00:01:58.476 --> 00:02:03.261
Well. I can't put it all on
Michael. it started at home.

20
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:05.266
God made you a boy.

21
00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.089
I always knew I was different.

22
00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:09.403
Weirdo ass niggas.

23
00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:11.811
- And my best
friend Tina knew I was too.

24
00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:14.297
- Be true to yourself. whoever
don't like that fuck them

25
00:02:14.297 --> 00:02:15.982
with both of our dicks.

26
00:02:15.982 --> 00:02:20.625
- From then on it was me
and her against the world.

27
00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:22.629
and we were up to.

28
00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.212
Tina got married to
Derrek. and O came out.

29
00:02:27.204 --> 00:02:28.954
I'm with it.

30
00:02:28.954 --> 00:02:31.827
And accepted me for who I was.

31
00:02:31.827 --> 00:02:34.327
Shit was good until it wasn't.

32
00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:37.334
O got killed.

33
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:41.576
and I had to start over from scratch.

34
00:02:41.576 --> 00:02:43.986
That's when I bumped into Michael.

35
00:02:43.986 --> 00:02:47.450
an architect who wanted
to build a life with me.

36
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.867
but that couldn't happen
without a sturdy foundation.

37
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.850
I decided to tell him the truth about me.

38
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.267
The truth is I was born a boy

39
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.800
and I do have male body parts.

40
00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.959
And was lucky. all he did was leave.

41
00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.729
I was heartbroken. feeling hopeless.

42
00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:15.188
until my bitch surprised
me with a house in LA.

43
00:03:15.188 --> 00:03:17.039
She wanted me to be close to her

44
00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.718
and far from the drama in Atlanta.

45
00:03:19.718 --> 00:03:23.739
but not before we spent
one last New Year's there.

46
00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.422
but be careful when you
say one last anything.

47
00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:30.384
'cause it really could be your last.

48
00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:33.182
Tina.

49
00:03:34.626 --> 00:03:36.654
My love. I'm not Tina.

50
00:03:36.654 --> 00:03:38.083
I'm so sorry for your loss.

51
00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:40.512
but like I told you before.
your friend is gone.

52
00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.700
Fuck you. don't tell me Tina's gone

53
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.199
when she's standing right there.

54
00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.249
Where's my sis. where did she go?

55
00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:49.746
My love. please calm down.

56
00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:51.636
What are y'all trying to do to me?

57
00:03:51.636 --> 00:03:53.811
Why am I strapped to this bed?

58
00:03:53.811 --> 00:03:55.766
- Just calm down. I'm
gonna get the doctor.

59
00:03:55.766 --> 00:04:00.433
- Where's my sis?

60
00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:06.758
Tina!

61
00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:10.296
I'm right here sis.

62
00:04:11.238 --> 00:04:13.256
Tina these people got me fucked up.

63
00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:16.246
- Let these people do they
job to save your life.

64
00:04:16.246 --> 00:04:19.848
If you keep this up. you gonna
end up dead. or worse. 302'd.

65
00:04:19.848 --> 00:04:21.490
and who the hell gonna keep my name alive

66
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.857
if any of that shit happens.

67
00:04:23.857 --> 00:04:27.774
Now I need you to live
for me. can you do that?

68
00:04:30.652 --> 00:04:34.152
Promise me you'll live for me. promise me.

69
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.620
I promise.

70
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.327
Make sure your fingers ain't crossed

71
00:04:43.327 --> 00:04:47.744
tighter than your pussy hole.

72
00:04:53.023 --> 00:04:56.455
Ms. Mitchell. you've had a seizure.

73
00:04:56.455 --> 00:04:58.130
I need you to stay calm.

74
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.620
we really don't want
you to have another one.

75
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.688
- I went into
the hospital broken.

76
00:05:06.688 --> 00:05:10.438
but I came out fixed
and I mean. fixed fixed.

77
00:05:13.808 --> 00:05:16.558
Turns out my nurse was trans too.

78
00:05:17.678 --> 00:05:19.547
she's the one who convinced me

79
00:05:19.547 --> 00:05:22.464
to get sexual reassignment surgery.

80
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.517
She said it took for
her to fully transition

81
00:05:26.517 --> 00:05:29.267
to be able to live a normal life.

82
00:05:33.503 --> 00:05:38.086
She ended up marrying a good
guy and even adopted kids.

83
00:05:39.217 --> 00:05:40.917
The picture she painted in my mind

84
00:05:40.917 --> 00:05:43.487
was all I needed to make the decision.

85
00:05:53.922 --> 00:05:55.589
I bought you this.

86
00:05:57.806 --> 00:06:01.688
So these are the dilators that
the doctor told you about.

87
00:06:01.688 --> 00:06:06.222
start small and work your way
up daily for 10 minutes each.

88
00:06:06.222 --> 00:06:07.366
So for a whole year straight.

89
00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:11.991
I'm supposed to masturbate
for 40 damn minutes?

90
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:15.548
- Girl. unless you got a man
penetrating you on a regular.

91
00:06:15.548 --> 00:06:18.798
that hole will not stay open by itself.

92
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.160
What's that like?

93
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.679
Ooh. well. for me not so regular lately

94
00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:31.950
with me doing 14 hour shifts.

95
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.462
but having a constant partner.

96
00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:35.820
and. you know. choosing
to go stealth period.

97
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.487
it feels exactly what you
want it to feel like. freedom.

98
00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.089
You still feel good about
your decision. right?

99
00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:48.506
Because it's normal to go back and forth.

100
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.289
I just wish me and Tina

101
00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:56.620
would've both gone
stealth a long time ago.

102
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.860
then maybe she'd still be alive. you know?

103
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.058
- Well. I understand. but try
not to think of the what-ifs

104
00:07:04.058 --> 00:07:06.510
'cause it can drive you insane.

105
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.245
Besides you told me yourself before

106
00:07:08.245 --> 00:07:11.662
that Tina was loved just the way she was.

107
00:07:12.739 --> 00:07:13.572
True.

108
00:07:14.993 --> 00:07:17.119
And to be honest.

109
00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:21.139
I'm just glad I got a chance
to experience real love.

110
00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:24.361
even if it was for a
short period of time sis.

111
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:28.650
I'd rather that than two
lifetimes without it.

112
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.367
- So you should stop
feeling sorry for her.

113
00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:34.033
- You can hear her?
- Who?

114
00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:37.663
- Tina. she was just. you
didn't. you didn't hear her?

115
00:07:37.663 --> 00:07:39.118
- You. you didn't see her?
- No.

116
00:07:39.118 --> 00:07:40.782
- I thought that's why you said-

117
00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:41.615
You know what. Celess.

118
00:07:41.615 --> 00:07:43.476
you probably still heavily medicated.

119
00:07:43.476 --> 00:07:44.784
why don't you get some rest?

120
00:07:44.784 --> 00:07:45.826
I'll clean this up for you.

121
00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:48.783
and you know. I can always
let myself out. okay?

122
00:07:48.783 --> 00:07:50.464
So get some rest.

123
00:07:50.464 --> 00:07:54.631
So keep this and I'll clean
this up for you. okay?

124
00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:05.479
You gotta sell this house. sis.

125
00:08:06.496 --> 00:08:08.716
Tina. what is happening?

126
00:08:08.716 --> 00:08:11.633
Am I losing my mind? Am I dreaming?

127
00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:17.409
I'm dead. ain't I?

128
00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:19.909
You ain't dead. drama queen.

129
00:08:20.866 --> 00:08:23.257
If I'm dead sis. just say that.

130
00:08:23.257 --> 00:08:27.206
- You're depressed. and
it's because of this house.

131
00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:30.846
Every time you look at the
front door. you start crying.

132
00:08:30.846 --> 00:08:35.846
You can't stay anymore. Celess.
it's not healthy for you.

133
00:08:36.256 --> 00:08:38.247
Now put this house on the market.

134
00:08:38.247 --> 00:08:40.446
along with that new body of yours.

135
00:08:40.446 --> 00:08:44.070
and get back outside bitch.
it's still hunting season.

136
00:08:53.547 --> 00:08:57.047
Your total will be $36.421 and 19 cents.

137
00:09:00.011 --> 00:09:00.844
Okay.

138
00:09:19.536 --> 00:09:22.036
- You can keep it.
- Thank you.

139
00:09:26.976 --> 00:09:29.536
- Are you a model?
- No.

140
00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:31.453
- An actress?
- No. why?

141
00:09:32.815 --> 00:09:36.395
- Because you're the first
girl I've seen come in here

142
00:09:36.395 --> 00:09:37.265
who looks like me

143
00:09:37.265 --> 00:09:39.056
and run up digits like these

144
00:09:39.056 --> 00:09:43.080
without a nigga's
permission or supervision.

145
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.868
and to be straight up with you.

146
00:09:44.868 --> 00:09:46.701
I'm trying to be down.

147
00:09:47.908 --> 00:09:51.825
So if you don't mind me
asking. what do you do?

148
00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:56.750
- You want the truth?
- Even if it hurts.

149
00:09:58.066 --> 00:10:01.215
- Truth was I wasn't
doing shit at the moment

150
00:10:01.215 --> 00:10:04.555
but living off the money I
got from selling my house.

151
00:10:04.555 --> 00:10:06.374
but the hunger in this girl's eyes

152
00:10:06.374 --> 00:10:09.791
reminded me of what I needed to be doing.

153
00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:12.544
I run G on niggas.

154
00:10:24.882 --> 00:10:26.634
Hungry. nah.

155
00:10:26.634 --> 00:10:30.551
- You need a partner?
- This bitch was starving.

156
00:10:31.648 --> 00:10:33.443
I had an idea.

157
00:10:33.443 --> 00:10:37.610
How about this. when you
quit your day job. DM me.

158
00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:55.343
- I'm sorry baby. I'm gonna
have someone else ring you up.

159
00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:56.783
I don't work here anymore.

160
00:10:56.783 --> 00:10:59.263
- Well. wait a minute.
can I get the DM too?

161
00:10:59.263 --> 00:11:00.930
Hey check your DM.

162
00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:07.790
Persistent. you cute and crazy as fuck.

163
00:11:11.553 --> 00:11:15.379
Hell. you do fit the job
description. Come on.

164
00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:17.628
My first day out in over a year.

165
00:11:17.628 --> 00:11:20.613
and instantly I meet
my motherfucking match.

166
00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:23.363
- I'm Si Si by the way.
- Celess.

167
00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:26.733
Yeah. I saw that on your IG.

168
00:11:37.505 --> 00:11:40.943
Are you Spanish or do you just speak it?

169
00:11:40.943 --> 00:11:44.913
- Nobody's Spanish mami.
Spanish is just the language.

170
00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:48.113
I'm Dominican and there's
some Asian in me too.

171
00:11:48.113 --> 00:11:50.213
I just don't really know the specifics.

172
00:11:50.213 --> 00:11:51.835
My dad was killed when I was young.

173
00:11:51.835 --> 00:11:56.433
so I never got to know him
or his side of the family.

174
00:11:56.433 --> 00:11:58.664
Originally I'm from Miami.

175
00:11:58.664 --> 00:12:00.653
but like half the people in this town.

176
00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:03.615
I moved out here to
pursue fame and fortune.

177
00:12:03.615 --> 00:12:05.423
- It was just-
- I'm not gonna lie.

178
00:12:05.423 --> 00:12:08.823
My first thought was to pimp Si Si.

179
00:12:08.823 --> 00:12:13.490
but after hearing her story.
I wanted more for the girl.

180
00:12:15.293 --> 00:12:17.453
I'm sorry to hear that.

181
00:12:17.453 --> 00:12:19.503
It's okay. my mom been through hell

182
00:12:19.503 --> 00:12:22.670
so she couldn't wait to get to heaven.

183
00:12:23.874 --> 00:12:27.683
Anyways. I started working
little jobs to pay the rent.

184
00:12:27.683 --> 00:12:30.083
and when I tell you I was this close

185
00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.083
to starting an OnlyFans.

186
00:12:33.223 --> 00:12:36.305
Well look at that. it's demon time.

187
00:12:44.782 --> 00:12:46.742
Si Si was a fast learner.

188
00:12:46.742 --> 00:12:48.323
If I ain't know any better.

189
00:12:48.323 --> 00:12:52.218
I would think she been doing this shit.

190
00:12:52.218 --> 00:12:54.927
Her game was top tier too.

191
00:12:54.927 --> 00:12:59.260
She had a way with niggas.
she spoke their language.

192
00:13:01.274 --> 00:13:04.691
Fucking literally. Hook line and sinker.

193
00:13:12.229 --> 00:13:15.896
Planting ourselves at
the right happy hours

194
00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:19.184
led to invitations to
the right car reveals.

195
00:13:19.184 --> 00:13:21.647
- It looks like I'm
finally getting on Oscar nod.

196
00:13:21.647 --> 00:13:24.219
I saw that congratulations.

197
00:13:24.219 --> 00:13:25.842
- Hey man. congrats on
that new round of funding.

198
00:13:25.842 --> 00:13:28.699
- Ah. thanks man. we're
gonna fucking kill that IPO.

199
00:13:28.699 --> 00:13:30.047
My Guy. what's up.

200
00:13:30.047 --> 00:13:31.749
- What's happening?
- When's the new album coming?

201
00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:34.341
- Real soon. but you know I'm
dropping it as an NFT. right?

202
00:13:34.341 --> 00:13:35.804
Oh. smart move.

203
00:13:35.804 --> 00:13:37.019
Now you keep thinking like that.

204
00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:38.212
you'll actually be able to afford

205
00:13:38.212 --> 00:13:40.868
one of these bitches one day.

206
00:13:56.097 --> 00:13:58.232
And those car reveals

207
00:13:58.232 --> 00:14:00.732
led to the right art auctions.

208
00:14:02.453 --> 00:14:04.378
- And a million
two on the phone now.

209
00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:05.814
a million two.

210
00:14:05.814 --> 00:14:08.795
coming in a million three
at the back of the room.

211
00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:10.062
at a million three.

212
00:14:19.852 --> 00:14:24.519
- It was as simple
as leading a horse to water.

213
00:14:50.533 --> 00:14:52.823
- But Si Si
wasn't the type to dream.

214
00:14:57.424 --> 00:15:01.341
Nah. she gonna bottle
that shit up and sell it.

215
00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:03.317
Sold.

216
00:15:05.528 --> 00:15:06.632
After four months of us

217
00:15:06.632 --> 00:15:08.932
being in all the right places.

218
00:15:08.932 --> 00:15:13.765
Si Si and I racked up quite a
few rich and famous friends.

219
00:15:14.868 --> 00:15:19.158
and one of them just happened
to be acting fucking royalty.

220
00:15:34.327 --> 00:15:37.759
- Next thing I
know I'm on major blogs.

221
00:15:44.936 --> 00:15:47.936
Si Si was given a modeling contract.

222
00:15:48.929 --> 00:15:52.368
and I was booking goddamn
TV show appearances.

223
00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.868
Celess Mitchell.

224
00:15:59.988 --> 00:16:02.571
Oh. turn this up. I love her.

225
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.398
- See you. beautiful
as always. please have a seat.

226
00:16:09.398 --> 00:16:11.201
Definitely.

227
00:16:11.201 --> 00:16:15.736
- So tell me how does it
feel to be the new it girl?

228
00:16:15.736 --> 00:16:17.577
Honestly. I'm just happy to be here.

229
00:16:17.577 --> 00:16:20.660
- Yeah. I love her too.
- So excited.

230
00:16:40.388 --> 00:16:43.555
No. but seriously. thank you Celess.

231
00:16:45.808 --> 00:16:48.628
I dreamt of shit like this my whole life.

232
00:16:48.628 --> 00:16:52.993
got abused. used. and played.
trying to chase this shit.

233
00:16:52.993 --> 00:16:55.384
and all it took was a real ass bitch

234
00:16:55.384 --> 00:16:59.066
to come walking in my store
that day eight months ago.

235
00:16:59.066 --> 00:17:02.566
I owe you my life Celess that's real talk.

236
00:17:06.065 --> 00:17:07.482
Ya zaddy calling.

237
00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:11.566
Si Si was doing what she loved.

238
00:17:11.566 --> 00:17:13.176
and I was doing who I loved.

239
00:17:13.176 --> 00:17:14.009
Hello.

240
00:17:15.335 --> 00:17:19.046
But our biggest flex was
presenting at a major award show.

241
00:17:21.126 --> 00:17:22.566
My publicist and our team

242
00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:25.176
pulled some crazy strings
to make that happen.

243
00:17:34.703 --> 00:17:37.171
- Okay we need to put a
motherfucking pep in our step.

244
00:17:37.171 --> 00:17:40.171
Listen. y'all have carpet
at three o'clock sharp.

245
00:17:40.171 --> 00:17:44.118
Not 3:01. not 3:02. and
Gerald where's Si Si?

246
00:17:44.118 --> 00:17:47.334
I don't know. let me call her.

247
00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:50.254
- Okay you're all set.
you can go get your dress-

248
00:17:50.254 --> 00:17:53.074
Where you at. Vicky's about to lose it.

249
00:17:53.074 --> 00:17:54.983
Oh perfect. thank you.

250
00:17:54.983 --> 00:17:56.313
She's walking up right now.

251
00:17:56.313 --> 00:18:00.313
- Right now? Right now's
too motherfucking late.

252
00:18:01.492 --> 00:18:02.575
Hola. hola!

253
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:12.159
Dios mio mami. I love this dress.

254
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.077
- And I love my job. I
need you in glam right now.

255
00:18:16.077 --> 00:18:18.200
before I fucking lose it.

256
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.059
- And your job love you too.
Vicky. it ain't going nowhere.

257
00:18:23.059 --> 00:18:24.776
- Listen.
- Gerald?

258
00:18:33.089 --> 00:18:35.027
This is your moment bitch.

259
00:18:35.027 --> 00:18:36.295
you kiss the right ass tonight.

260
00:18:36.295 --> 00:18:39.891
you'll never have to suck dick again.

261
00:18:39.891 --> 00:18:43.241
I got my lips puckered bitch.

262
00:18:56.715 --> 00:19:00.844
- Si Si. Celess. you ladies
look absolutely stunning.

263
00:19:00.844 --> 00:19:03.204
Celess we know who you're wearing.

264
00:19:03.204 --> 00:19:06.578
but Si Si tell us who
are you wearing tonight?

265
00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:09.526
- I'm wearing for-
- Look at this shit.

266
00:19:09.526 --> 00:19:13.109
- Oh my God. I love
it. You look beautiful.

267
00:19:15.807 --> 00:19:19.390
- This nigga done took
his act to Lalaland.

268
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.276
Um. excuse me.

269
00:20:05.276 --> 00:20:06.421
How the hell do you say get a room

270
00:20:06.421 --> 00:20:08.745
in whatever language it is y'all speaking?

271
00:20:08.745 --> 00:20:12.062
- Hey. y'all mind if I
steal her for a second?

272
00:20:12.062 --> 00:20:16.323
- Please do. she's cock
blocking like shit right now.

273
00:20:16.323 --> 00:20:18.823
Yo congratulations too. man.

274
00:20:42.159 --> 00:20:42.992
Let's play a game.

275
00:20:45.584 --> 00:20:46.500
What kind of game?

276
00:20:48.801 --> 00:20:49.984
Truth or dare.

277
00:20:54.242 --> 00:20:55.075
Okay.

278
00:20:57.579 --> 00:21:01.595
Why you seem so scared all of a sudden?

279
00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:05.345
You got some truths you
don't want to reveal?

280
00:21:07.111 --> 00:21:11.778
- Maybe there's just some
dares that I wouldn't dare do.

281
00:21:15.867 --> 00:21:17.372
We'll see about that.

282
00:21:28.627 --> 00:21:31.937
All right. I'm gonna go first.

283
00:21:31.937 --> 00:21:33.537
- Cool?
- Cool.

284
00:21:34.727 --> 00:21:37.802
Is it true that you were born

285
00:21:40.052 --> 00:21:43.052
on the same day as Donald Trump Jr.?

286
00:21:50.479 --> 00:21:55.243
- Honestly. I don't know
what day that nigga was born.

287
00:21:55.243 --> 00:21:58.826
- Come on. on New Year's
Eve just like you.

288
00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:04.696
but that was just a test.
see if you would be honest.

289
00:22:06.545 --> 00:22:09.246
I hate this fucking game.

290
00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:13.203
It looks like our enemies are friends.

291
00:22:13.203 --> 00:22:16.353
Find me location and I'll make sure

292
00:22:16.353 --> 00:22:18.936
you have a five star stay here.

293
00:22:27.618 --> 00:22:31.748
- Is it true that your
favorite color is blue?

294
00:22:31.748 --> 00:22:35.868
- Well. turquoise. but
that's close enough.

295
00:22:35.868 --> 00:22:40.618
- Turquoise. turquoise is blue
with a fucking filter man.

296
00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:42.655
- Turquoise.
- Okay.

297
00:22:42.655 --> 00:22:46.184
All right. all right. all right my turn.

298
00:22:46.184 --> 00:22:49.684
Is it true that your middle name is Carter

299
00:22:50.929 --> 00:22:54.517
because your mom wanted
to name you after Jay-Z?

300
00:22:54.517 --> 00:22:58.775
Hell no. my name ain't no damn Carter

301
00:22:59.899 --> 00:23:03.316
and my mom's ain't no groupie. all right?

302
00:23:04.639 --> 00:23:07.139
So what is your middle name?

303
00:23:11.937 --> 00:23:16.520
- That. that's information
I only disclose at the altar

304
00:23:17.466 --> 00:23:19.049
or on my death bed.

305
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:29.220
Oh. and speaking of
altar. this one's a dare.

306
00:23:35.017 --> 00:23:37.517
Celess. I dare you to say yes.

307
00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:43.992
I want you to be my
leading lady in real life.

308
00:23:45.988 --> 00:23:48.856
I love Shaun. yeah.

309
00:23:48.856 --> 00:23:52.636
but I wasn't sure I
was ready to marry him.

310
00:23:52.636 --> 00:23:56.636
but for the sake of being
done with this damn game...

311
00:23:56.636 --> 00:24:00.969
- Everybody. it's happening.
Get into your position.

312
00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:15.700
- She said. yes y'all.

313
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.240
You better work bitch.

314
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.180
All right I have one more dare.

315
00:24:28.235 --> 00:24:29.068
What?

316
00:24:31.685 --> 00:24:34.435
I dare you to marry me tonight.

317
00:24:36.085 --> 00:24:39.168
Do it. do it. do it. do it.

318
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.715
- This was
happening way too fast.

319
00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:47.715
everything was a blur.
but then it became clear.

320
00:24:48.815 --> 00:24:51.365
This is what my sis always wanted for me.

321
00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:53.032
so I had to say yes.

322
00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.820
Something new.

323
00:25:20.155 --> 00:25:24.738
- Something old. and as in
old I do mean vintage bitch.

324
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.697
And then we have something borrowed.

325
00:25:36.165 --> 00:25:38.165
- Wow.
- Oh my God. babe.

326
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:42.535
I know this isn't the necklace

327
00:25:42.535 --> 00:25:45.607
your mom wore when she won her Oscar.

328
00:25:45.607 --> 00:25:48.815
- Yeah. I seen how
mesmerized you were looking

329
00:25:48.815 --> 00:25:49.657
at it in the pictures.

330
00:25:49.657 --> 00:25:53.014
I just. I knew it had to be yours.

331
00:25:53.014 --> 00:25:56.009
- Aww.
- Something blue. y'all.

332
00:26:01.564 --> 00:26:04.564
- Shaun Archibald Simon.
- Archibald?

333
00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:08.824
We at the alter. ain't we?

334
00:26:08.824 --> 00:26:13.824
- Do you take Celess Mitchell
to be your wedded wife?

335
00:26:13.945 --> 00:26:15.445
I definitely do.

336
00:26:16.494 --> 00:26:20.994
- Celess. do you take Shaun
to be your wedded husband?

337
00:26:26.866 --> 00:26:29.033
Yes I do.

338
00:26:30.024 --> 00:26:32.734
- I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

339
00:26:32.734 --> 00:26:34.824
you may kiss your bride.

340
00:27:02.055 --> 00:27:03.235
Luckily this wouldn't be

341
00:27:03.235 --> 00:27:05.261
our first time having sex

342
00:27:05.261 --> 00:27:08.241
because the first time was horrible.

343
00:27:08.241 --> 00:27:10.491
He almost clocked me bitch.

344
00:27:13.871 --> 00:27:16.371
I hadn't dilated for
like a week beforehand

345
00:27:16.371 --> 00:27:18.371
and I was paying for it.

346
00:27:19.342 --> 00:27:23.521
It felt like my fucking
hole was closing up.

347
00:27:23.521 --> 00:27:25.521
The pain was unbearable.

348
00:27:26.892 --> 00:27:30.451
- Celess what's wrong?
- I had to think fast.

349
00:27:30.451 --> 00:27:32.584
Shit. what would Tina say?

350
00:27:32.584 --> 00:27:34.758
- Sis. that's easy. tell him you're a-

351
00:27:34.758 --> 00:27:35.591
Virgin?

352
00:27:36.547 --> 00:27:38.591
You mean to tell me I took Celess.

353
00:27:38.591 --> 00:27:42.472
who's on every man's wishlist virginity?

354
00:27:42.472 --> 00:27:45.889
Shit. I'm fucking luckier than I thought.

355
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:59.481
The second time was no better.

356
00:27:59.481 --> 00:28:01.814
even though I came prepared.

357
00:28:02.723 --> 00:28:06.036
Not only did I dilate
every day leading up to it.

358
00:28:06.036 --> 00:28:08.607
but I also lubricated.

359
00:28:08.607 --> 00:28:10.467
What I wasn't prepared for

360
00:28:10.467 --> 00:28:13.727
was the depth of my new damn vagina.

361
00:28:13.727 --> 00:28:16.227
It couldn't accommodate Shaun.

362
00:28:28.467 --> 00:28:31.050
Something ain't right Celess.

363
00:28:32.038 --> 00:28:36.604
Fuck. Tina. I need you bitch.

364
00:28:37.907 --> 00:28:39.027
What now sis?

365
00:28:39.027 --> 00:28:42.286
You do realize that Google's
your best friend. right?

366
00:28:42.286 --> 00:28:45.367
- Tell him-
- I had surgery down there

367
00:28:45.367 --> 00:28:50.284
when I was a teenager and it
made things a bit complicated.

368
00:28:51.507 --> 00:28:52.757
I'm sorry baby.

369
00:29:01.415 --> 00:29:02.415
Come here.

370
00:29:11.063 --> 00:29:15.480
- The third time
though. that was the charm.

371
00:29:48.597 --> 00:29:49.430
Wake up.

372
00:29:57.491 --> 00:29:59.442
Oh my God. babe.

373
00:29:59.442 --> 00:30:02.492
I can't believe I still
have this necklace on.

374
00:30:02.492 --> 00:30:04.833
Yeah well I was trying to take it off

375
00:30:04.833 --> 00:30:05.887
while you were asleep.

376
00:30:05.887 --> 00:30:08.554
but you wouldn't part ways with it.

377
00:30:10.565 --> 00:30:12.367
Babe. why are you fully dressed?

378
00:30:12.367 --> 00:30:14.087
Where are you going?

379
00:30:14.087 --> 00:30:17.743
- 'Bout to go get some
breakfast. I'm starving.

380
00:30:17.743 --> 00:30:19.622
You don't have to do all that.

381
00:30:19.622 --> 00:30:21.539
I'll cook us something.

382
00:30:28.542 --> 00:30:30.586
No wonder you married me so quick.

383
00:30:30.586 --> 00:30:31.823
one more night as a bachelor.

384
00:30:31.823 --> 00:30:34.403
you probably would've starved to death.

385
00:30:34.403 --> 00:30:39.192
- A nigga ain't buy the
Titanic diamond for nothing.

386
00:30:39.192 --> 00:30:41.525
My life depended on it. be right back.

387
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:59.563
Hello?

388
00:31:00.433 --> 00:31:01.499
Do your Hollywood friends

389
00:31:01.499 --> 00:31:05.082
know you hiding a dick
up under that dress?

390
00:31:07.577 --> 00:31:09.750
Who the hell is this?

391
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:14.022
- Nah. see the better question
is what fuck the do I want?

392
00:31:14.022 --> 00:31:17.815
I want 20 grand. I'm gonna send
you some green dot numbers.

393
00:31:17.815 --> 00:31:19.493
You got seven days.

394
00:31:19.493 --> 00:31:23.201
I mean seven days for 20
grand to hit the account.

395
00:31:23.201 --> 00:31:26.226
or you're gonna be in a blog
for a whole 'nother reason.

396
00:31:26.226 --> 00:31:28.978
- Really Khalil. you
killed the only person

397
00:31:28.978 --> 00:31:31.061
I had in this entire world.

398
00:31:31.061 --> 00:31:34.546
and now you're trying
to extort me for money.

399
00:31:34.546 --> 00:31:38.368
You better be lucky I let
you fucking live bitch.

400
00:31:38.368 --> 00:31:40.201
Oh. you let me live.

401
00:31:41.097 --> 00:31:43.740
See. I would say you grew a pair of balls.

402
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.027
but we both know you
had 'em the whole time.

403
00:31:47.027 --> 00:31:48.348
Now check it out. there's a nigga in here

404
00:31:48.348 --> 00:31:50.739
way more out of his mind than me.

405
00:31:50.739 --> 00:31:53.870
and to be honest. the
nigga wants you ghosted.

406
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.518
but I thought about it.

407
00:31:56.518 --> 00:31:58.069
And now that you got this newfound fame.

408
00:31:58.069 --> 00:32:02.927
I figure you're worth way
more alive and living it up.

409
00:32:02.927 --> 00:32:06.427
So like I said. you got seven days

410
00:32:06.427 --> 00:32:11.208
and that's me letting you
live. you fucking punk.

411
00:32:14.123 --> 00:32:16.678
It's the audacity for me.

412
00:32:16.678 --> 00:32:20.437
Nigga. you killed my sis in my house.

413
00:32:20.437 --> 00:32:22.647
then pulled the trigger on me.

414
00:32:22.647 --> 00:32:27.287
and you got the nerve to call
my phone and try to tax me.

415
00:32:27.287 --> 00:32:31.493
talking about some nigga
want me ghosted. the fuck?

416
00:32:31.493 --> 00:32:33.251
What nigga could that be?

417
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:37.834
But your lying trying to
scare me into cutting a check.

418
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.430
But would he really do some
hoe shit and go to the blogs?

419
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.347
Shit. he ain't got nothing to lose.

420
00:32:48.494 --> 00:32:52.001
fuck around and come up
off that little 15 minutes.

421
00:32:52.001 --> 00:32:54.179
Meanwhile all the
relationships I built out here.

422
00:32:54.179 --> 00:32:57.453
what they just come crashing down?

423
00:32:57.453 --> 00:32:59.504
What about Si Si?

424
00:32:59.504 --> 00:33:04.095
Shit she might be blackballed
just for fucking with me.

425
00:33:04.095 --> 00:33:07.247
All her dreams down the fucking shit hole.

426
00:33:07.247 --> 00:33:12.080
and Shaun. Shaun would never
look at me the same again.

427
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.409
Fuck. the industry won't
look at him the same.

428
00:33:16.409 --> 00:33:20.118
He could lose his career because of me.

429
00:33:20.118 --> 00:33:25.118
What now God. huh? What
do you want from me now?

430
00:33:25.423 --> 00:33:28.330
I thought I paid the fucking price.

431
00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.993
What more do you fucking want from me?

432
00:33:54.982 --> 00:33:57.160
Now you going too far.

433
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:57.993
You want that man to come home

434
00:33:57.993 --> 00:34:00.877
and see you dead in his place.

435
00:34:00.877 --> 00:34:03.997
Celess. now you know that man loves you.

436
00:34:03.997 --> 00:34:06.080
Don't scar him like that.

437
00:34:07.935 --> 00:34:10.965
especially not over goddamn Khalil.

438
00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:42.889
Baby.

439
00:34:55.491 --> 00:34:58.124
Baby. baby?

440
00:35:21.466 --> 00:35:22.891
- H-hello?

441
00:35:22.891 --> 00:35:23.803
Si Si.

442
00:35:23.803 --> 00:35:26.490
You spoke to Celess today?

443
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.490
No. why? What's wrong?

444
00:35:44.528 --> 00:35:46.688
- Hello 9-1-1
what's your emergency please?

445
00:35:46.688 --> 00:35:49.951
Hi I came home and my girl. my.

446
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:52.588
I'm sorry. my wife is missing.

447
00:35:52.588 --> 00:35:54.818
It looks like somebody
might have broken in.

448
00:35:54.818 --> 00:35:56.099
How old is your wife. sir?

449
00:35:56.099 --> 00:35:57.016
She's 24.

450
00:35:58.259 --> 00:36:00.868
- Did you two have any
disagreements lately?

451
00:36:00.868 --> 00:36:01.758
No. no. no. no.

452
00:36:01.758 --> 00:36:05.838
The crazy thing is we just
got married last night.

453
00:36:05.838 --> 00:36:07.988
I had a big party here. everybody
seen me give her a ring.

454
00:36:07.988 --> 00:36:10.308
- There was mad people here.
- Okay.

455
00:36:10.308 --> 00:36:11.938
- Plus there's a very
rare and expensive chain

456
00:36:11.938 --> 00:36:13.898
that's broken all over my place.

457
00:36:13.898 --> 00:36:14.823
Was there forced to entry?

458
00:36:14.823 --> 00:36:17.989
- Look. just get somebody
here quick please.

459
00:36:17.989 --> 00:36:19.068
All right. we have an officer

460
00:36:19.068 --> 00:36:20.405
en route to you. sir.

461
00:36:20.405 --> 00:36:23.072
What's your first and last name?

462
00:36:34.858 --> 00:36:37.621
Si Si. what the hell are you doing here?

463
00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:41.320
- You tell me Celess
because I was just fine.

464
00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.454
laid up under an Emmy winner.

465
00:36:43.454 --> 00:36:46.423
about to get more in
touch with my Asian side.

466
00:36:46.423 --> 00:36:49.717
when Shaun called me asking
in a panic. might I add.

467
00:36:49.717 --> 00:36:51.967
have I spoken to you today?

468
00:36:53.958 --> 00:36:57.625
- Si Si. I fucked up.
- How. what did you do?

469
00:36:58.929 --> 00:37:03.262
- Keep it together. sis.
tell her you got cold feet.

470
00:37:06.288 --> 00:37:10.371
- That lie could
work. but for how long?

471
00:37:19.078 --> 00:37:23.418
- Celess. baby.
Celess are you in there?

472
00:37:39.303 --> 00:37:42.191
Bitch. he thinks you were kidnapped.

473
00:37:42.191 --> 00:37:45.271
Celess. you gotta tell
him. he'll understand.

474
00:37:45.271 --> 00:37:47.741
Trust it's better than letting
him think you were kidnapped.

475
00:37:47.741 --> 00:37:51.037
he's probably going through it right now.

476
00:37:51.037 --> 00:37:54.287
I know. but I broke his mom's necklace.

477
00:37:55.451 --> 00:37:58.284
I don't wanna break his heart too.

478
00:37:59.368 --> 00:38:02.647
I just need a few days to figure it out.

479
00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:06.058
- Well. can we go to a
hotel for those few days?

480
00:38:06.058 --> 00:38:10.632
So we not just sitting around
in silence. a bitch is hungry.

481
00:38:10.632 --> 00:38:15.549
- What hotel we gonna walk into
without getting recognized?

482
00:38:18.817 --> 00:38:21.150
I got somewhere we can go.

483
00:39:13.167 --> 00:39:15.076
- And the guy who's
letting us stay here again.

484
00:39:15.076 --> 00:39:16.861
how do you know him?

485
00:39:16.861 --> 00:39:18.661
I told you before the boutique.

486
00:39:18.661 --> 00:39:21.661
I dog sat for some important people.

487
00:39:22.939 --> 00:39:26.740
Well how important do
you have to be to have a.

488
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.405
what the hell is this?

489
00:39:29.405 --> 00:39:32.895
- An underground bunker. all
the rich people have 'em.

490
00:39:32.895 --> 00:39:35.287
And serial killers.

491
00:39:35.287 --> 00:39:38.370
Gotta stop doing that shit. sis.

492
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:39.870
You good Celess?

493
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:44.609
What they got to eat?

494
00:39:48.839 --> 00:39:51.922
Celess. mami. these blogs tried it.

495
00:39:59.126 --> 00:40:00.076
What the fuck.

496
00:40:02.285 --> 00:40:03.118
What?

497
00:40:05.785 --> 00:40:07.959
No. no.

498
00:40:12.129 --> 00:40:13.712
Celess. you good?

499
00:40:17.804 --> 00:40:19.549
This is not the time to be throwing up.

500
00:40:19.549 --> 00:40:21.874
this is the time to be throwing down.

501
00:40:21.874 --> 00:40:26.707
So you need to come out here
so we can clap the fuck back.

502
00:40:37.509 --> 00:40:40.459
Vicki's calling me. you know she got wind.

503
00:40:40.459 --> 00:40:42.542
You want me to answer it?

504
00:40:45.137 --> 00:40:47.154
Shit Shaun's calling me.

505
00:40:49.028 --> 00:40:49.928
Celess.

506
00:40:51.587 --> 00:40:53.675
That goddamn Khalil.

507
00:40:53.675 --> 00:40:55.350
you need to get your publicist
on the phone right now

508
00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:59.157
and have them shut that
story down immediately.

509
00:40:59.157 --> 00:41:01.827
Sis. what I'm gonna do?

510
00:41:01.827 --> 00:41:03.578
What do you mean what are you gonna do?

511
00:41:03.578 --> 00:41:08.036
You about to come out the
bathroom and address this shit.

512
00:41:08.036 --> 00:41:10.286
Listen. do you trust her?

513
00:41:12.268 --> 00:41:14.123
Well. let's put her ass to the test.

514
00:41:14.123 --> 00:41:16.517
Tell her the truth. if shit goes south.

515
00:41:16.517 --> 00:41:18.510
bury that bitch in these woods.

516
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:23.180
and if she stands tall. y'all
call the publicist together.

517
00:41:41.525 --> 00:41:44.749
Are you fucking kidding me?

518
00:41:44.749 --> 00:41:46.841
Oh shit. it's Shaun.

519
00:41:46.841 --> 00:41:50.220
- Oh my God Vicki. what
you gonna tell him?

520
00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.161
I'll figure out something.

521
00:41:51.161 --> 00:41:53.261
Just drop your pin.

522
00:41:53.261 --> 00:41:56.761
and don't do or say shit 'til I get there.

523
00:41:59.772 --> 00:42:00.939
- Hello?
- Vicky.

524
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.447
Is there any truth to this shit?

525
00:42:06.645 --> 00:42:10.395
And where the fuck is
Celess at with my ring?

526
00:42:15.788 --> 00:42:18.843
So what are you gonna do about Shaun?

527
00:42:18.843 --> 00:42:20.373
And don't don't tell me you don't know

528
00:42:20.373 --> 00:42:22.643
because it's your job to know.

529
00:42:22.643 --> 00:42:25.394
- Shaun. you don't sound
too good. you straight bro?

530
00:42:25.394 --> 00:42:27.303
Speaking of straight Vicki.

531
00:42:27.303 --> 00:42:30.346
do me a solid and give
it to me just like that.

532
00:42:30.346 --> 00:42:32.729
don't sprinkle your sugar on this shit.

533
00:42:32.729 --> 00:42:34.940
put your. put your spin on it.

534
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.773
just tell me the real.

535
00:42:38.538 --> 00:42:40.253
The real about what Shaun?

536
00:42:40.253 --> 00:42:44.369
- The shit in the blogs
about Celess come on. Vicki.

537
00:42:44.369 --> 00:42:45.271
Don't act like you don't know.

538
00:42:45.271 --> 00:42:49.543
'cause like I said. it's your job to know.

539
00:42:49.543 --> 00:42:50.793
I don't know.

540
00:42:52.273 --> 00:42:55.725
I don't know what I'm gonna do. period.

541
00:42:55.725 --> 00:42:58.225
I didn't think this far ahead.

542
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:03.507
I honestly thought after surgery

543
00:43:03.507 --> 00:43:06.340
shit like this would be behind me.

544
00:43:08.246 --> 00:43:11.079
Can. Can I see?

545
00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.395
I'm sorry too soon?

546
00:43:16.438 --> 00:43:18.620
No bitch. too nosy.

547
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.036
How would you feel if
somebody randomly asked

548
00:43:20.036 --> 00:43:22.869
- to see your pussy?
- Depend on who.

549
00:43:24.606 --> 00:43:27.429
Listen. I'm sorry I'm just
trying to lighten the mood.

550
00:43:27.429 --> 00:43:30.141
- You want another drink?
- Please?

551
00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:32.596
- Shaun. you know you can't
be believing shit in the blogs

552
00:43:32.596 --> 00:43:35.450
and I will tell you this
Celess has not been kidnapped

553
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:37.005
and I'm actually about to leave my office

554
00:43:37.005 --> 00:43:38.150
to meet up with her right now.

555
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.809
and you'll be the first
person that I call.

556
00:43:40.809 --> 00:43:43.504
So it must be true then. huh?

557
00:43:43.504 --> 00:43:44.337
I didn't fucking say that.

558
00:43:44.337 --> 00:43:46.039
you gotta be Picasso to be drawing up

559
00:43:46.039 --> 00:43:47.631
those type of conclusions.

560
00:43:47.631 --> 00:43:49.429
You also didn't say no. Shaun.

561
00:43:49.429 --> 00:43:52.846
this shit is absolutely not fucking true.

562
00:43:54.421 --> 00:43:59.027
Besides being lied to in
this business for so long.

563
00:43:59.027 --> 00:44:02.194
I've. come to know 'em
when I fucking hear 'em.

564
00:44:04.411 --> 00:44:09.411
My wife is a transsexual. my
wife is a fucking transsexual?

565
00:44:09.904 --> 00:44:12.695
What does that make me. Vicki?

566
00:44:12.695 --> 00:44:15.112
Shaun. are you by yourself?

567
00:44:23.766 --> 00:44:24.599
Shaun?

568
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.357
Shaun!

569
00:44:35.331 --> 00:44:38.571
Listen. just know I'm not tripping.

570
00:44:38.571 --> 00:44:41.187
regardless of whatever
gender you were born as.

571
00:44:41.187 --> 00:44:43.319
or hell what your mama named you.

572
00:44:43.319 --> 00:44:48.311
you are Celess to me. my
friend. shit bitch my savior.

573
00:44:57.582 --> 00:44:58.818
It must be Vicki.

574
00:45:57.173 --> 00:45:59.072
Actor Shaun Simon was found

575
00:45:59.072 --> 00:46:03.262
fatally shot in his Malibu
home less than 72 hours

576
00:46:03.262 --> 00:46:06.972
after marrying rising
star Celess Mitchell.

577
00:46:06.972 --> 00:46:09.552
police don't suspect foul play.

578
00:46:09.552 --> 00:46:12.612
but an investigation is underway.

579
00:46:12.612 --> 00:46:15.352
The Simon family is asking for privacy

580
00:46:15.352 --> 00:46:19.092
during this time to mourn
the loss of their loved one.

581
00:46:19.092 --> 00:46:21.752
We are certainly keeping
them in our thoughts.

582
00:46:21.752 --> 00:46:26.421
and when we come back. Kanye
West is making headlines again.

583
00:46:26.421 --> 00:46:30.254
Find out why.

584
00:46:35.683 --> 00:46:38.102
Oh. so you ain't kidnapped after all.

585
00:46:38.102 --> 00:46:42.132
- Fuck you coward. I hope
you drop the fucking soap.

586
00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:44.205
- Damn.
- Listen here motherfucker.

587
00:46:44.205 --> 00:46:47.107
a man just took his life
on account of what you did.

588
00:46:47.107 --> 00:46:50.020
and I had to hear the shit.

589
00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:53.297
Khalil. you said I had seven days.

590
00:46:53.297 --> 00:46:55.745
You said I had seven fucking days.

591
00:46:55.745 --> 00:46:58.916
First off put leashes on your bitches.

592
00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:01.586
You and your bitch coming in hot today.

593
00:47:01.586 --> 00:47:03.275
Hey. what's her name again?

594
00:47:03.275 --> 00:47:04.942
Spicy? No. no Si Si.

595
00:47:07.095 --> 00:47:09.512
Aye. aye. is she a nigga too?

596
00:47:10.408 --> 00:47:12.042
And you had seven days

597
00:47:12.042 --> 00:47:15.340
until you pulled this whole
little kidnapping stunt.

598
00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.590
What?

599
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.622
- What you thought that was
gonna keep me from getting paid?

600
00:47:19.622 --> 00:47:21.680
So wait. you thought.

601
00:47:24.038 --> 00:47:25.020
you know what Khalil.

602
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.960
it don't even matter.

603
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.570
I'm guessing you got
your money from the blog.

604
00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:30.570
so what calling me for?

605
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:32.800
- Nah. see. I didn't give
up enough information

606
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.680
for them to prove anything.

607
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.930
So for now ain't no payday.

608
00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:40.347
but consider this shit a fucking warning.

609
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.667
This is fucked up.

610
00:47:48.163 --> 00:47:49.700
Beyond fucked up.

611
00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.770
Celess. baby. why you ain't
just tell me this from the jump.

612
00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:54.390
You know. I wouldn't have judged you?

613
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:55.223
Plus I would've got you

614
00:47:55.223 --> 00:47:58.490
way more opportunities. way more press.

615
00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:01.537
and we wouldn't even be
in this chaos right now.

616
00:48:01.537 --> 00:48:04.815
I know if I could rewind back time.

617
00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:07.849
I would for Shaun's sake. at least.

618
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:11.000
- I say give the bastard
the measly 20 grand

619
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
and be done with his miserable ass.

620
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.090
that way Celess can focus on healing.

621
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:20.140
and we can get back to climbing
before we lose the momentum.

622
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.831
- Before we start even talking
about going to the safe.

623
00:48:22.831 --> 00:48:26.475
Celess. do you think that he
would really go to the blogs?

624
00:48:26.475 --> 00:48:29.650
Wouldn't that be like basically
exposing himself. right?

625
00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:31.929
He could be bluffing.

626
00:48:31.929 --> 00:48:34.590
Khalil shot me in my motherfucking head.

627
00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:36.860
You know. he ain't one to bluff.

628
00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.055
But I wouldn't even guess at it.

629
00:48:39.055 --> 00:48:42.910
let the money do the talking
and shut that nigga up.

630
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.232
You can't pay that nigga either.

631
00:48:45.232 --> 00:48:47.427
Extortion is about residual income.

632
00:48:47.427 --> 00:48:49.060
you give him that measly 20 grand.

633
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.489
and next month he gonna want a
whole hundo. then half a mil.

634
00:48:52.489 --> 00:48:54.977
He's gonna be like the motherfucking IRS.

635
00:48:54.977 --> 00:48:59.310
the more you make. the more
he's gonna fucking take.

636
00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:03.519
All right y'all look.

637
00:49:03.519 --> 00:49:06.319
this is the man that killed my best friend

638
00:49:06.319 --> 00:49:08.609
and then turned the gun on me.

639
00:49:08.609 --> 00:49:09.442
He ain't bluffing.

640
00:49:11.176 --> 00:49:13.009
but if I pay him.

641
00:49:13.009 --> 00:49:15.619
it'll be like feeding a stray dog.

642
00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:19.079
He just gonna keep coming back for more.

643
00:49:19.079 --> 00:49:21.744
So what you gonna do Celess?

644
00:49:21.744 --> 00:49:23.570
That nigga gotta die period.

645
00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:26.570
and that's on my motherfucking soul.

646
00:49:32.946 --> 00:49:35.659
My job is crisis management.

647
00:49:35.659 --> 00:49:38.147
so if there's a crisis
then I'm gonna manage it.

648
00:49:38.147 --> 00:49:39.532
And listen I'm if doing

649
00:49:39.532 --> 00:49:42.386
what you gotta do was a fucking person.

650
00:49:42.386 --> 00:49:44.419
It is what it is.

651
00:49:44.419 --> 00:49:46.454
Let's give this nigga his flowers.

652
00:49:46.454 --> 00:49:49.121
get my Philly bitch on the line.

653
00:49:51.799 --> 00:49:56.217
- Yeah. but typically we
charged like 40 bands.

654
00:49:56.217 --> 00:49:58.546
but Tina was like family.

655
00:49:58.546 --> 00:50:01.235
right before our peoples got killed.

656
00:50:01.235 --> 00:50:05.235
So we gonna do this
one for 50%. I got you.

657
00:50:06.261 --> 00:50:07.844
Give me a few days.

658
00:50:09.851 --> 00:50:13.270
- She said give her a few
days and it'll get handled.

659
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:18.103
and get this she want the same
shit this nigga asking for.

660
00:50:18.977 --> 00:50:21.997
You need to book a flight to Philly.

661
00:50:21.997 --> 00:50:23.557
That does not sound too smart.

662
00:50:23.557 --> 00:50:25.538
it's gonna sound like you running.

663
00:50:25.538 --> 00:50:28.817
- She gotta make the
payment in person in cash.

664
00:50:28.817 --> 00:50:31.607
- That wouldn't be too good
for optics. I'm telling you.

665
00:50:31.607 --> 00:50:33.049
can't she either send it like Zelle

666
00:50:33.049 --> 00:50:36.257
- or fucking Cash App?
- Those are traceable.

667
00:50:36.257 --> 00:50:39.212
The only untraceable way
to send money digitally

668
00:50:39.212 --> 00:50:40.824
is through crypto.

669
00:50:40.824 --> 00:50:44.650
Did you ever buy that
Ethereum. like I told you?

670
00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:46.909
I can't keep up with that shit.

671
00:50:46.909 --> 00:50:50.273
- It don't matter. either way
you need to go see this girl.

672
00:50:50.273 --> 00:50:52.149
She's about to have information on you

673
00:50:52.149 --> 00:50:55.771
that could put you in
jail for a long time.

674
00:50:55.771 --> 00:50:58.438
and shit us too for that matter.

675
00:50:59.819 --> 00:51:02.905
- This bitch got some
skeletons in her casket.

676
00:51:02.905 --> 00:51:06.331
- It's closet. sis.
- What'd you say?

677
00:51:06.331 --> 00:51:10.588
- She said positive
sis. meaning I'm right.

678
00:51:10.588 --> 00:51:12.108
Well at least fly private.

679
00:51:12.108 --> 00:51:15.388
we need to keep a low. low profile.

680
00:51:15.388 --> 00:51:17.087
She can't fly with more than 10 grand

681
00:51:17.087 --> 00:51:18.848
on a commercial flight anyways

682
00:51:18.848 --> 00:51:21.265
without it raising red flags.

683
00:51:22.927 --> 00:51:26.010
Damn. the cheapest charter is 30.000.

684
00:51:26.908 --> 00:51:30.477
- 30.000. between that and
the 20 I gotta give old girl

685
00:51:30.477 --> 00:51:32.258
that's half of my fucking stash.

686
00:51:32.258 --> 00:51:34.708
And don't forget about my overtime.

687
00:51:34.708 --> 00:51:36.327
Damn Vicki.

688
00:51:36.327 --> 00:51:39.577
- I love you to death. but
these ain't no regular fires.

689
00:51:39.577 --> 00:51:41.557
Shit. hell ain't got nothing on the fires

690
00:51:41.557 --> 00:51:43.724
that I'm about to put out.

691
00:51:45.437 --> 00:51:49.097
I get it. not even favors are free.

692
00:51:49.097 --> 00:51:51.482
Look. I can contribute.

693
00:51:51.482 --> 00:51:53.937
- I'm so sick and tired of
this petty ass conversation

694
00:51:53.937 --> 00:51:55.597
over this small money.

695
00:51:55.597 --> 00:51:57.467
Celess think who do you know

696
00:51:57.467 --> 00:51:59.423
spends this kind of money on fucking lunch

697
00:51:59.423 --> 00:52:04.423
and want Khalil ass in the
ground just as much as we do.

698
00:52:04.767 --> 00:52:07.910
- Now you're sure this is
not gonna come back on me.

699
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:08.850
I can afford anything.

700
00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:11.825
but I can't afford being linked to this.

701
00:52:11.825 --> 00:52:13.862
Derrek. I'll take the charge myself

702
00:52:13.862 --> 00:52:17.809
before I let your name get
caught up in this. trust me.

703
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:19.976
I take your word for it.

704
00:52:25.035 --> 00:52:27.035
So you must be Celess.

705
00:52:30.492 --> 00:52:33.250
And you must be fucking crazy.

706
00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.291
Celess.

707
00:52:35.591 --> 00:52:36.424
this is Sasha.

708
00:52:39.464 --> 00:52:41.881
Celess. what you mad about?

709
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:45.659
Girl it's okay if he move on.

710
00:52:45.659 --> 00:52:47.515
But with fish though?

711
00:52:47.515 --> 00:52:49.385
Who is she talking to?

712
00:52:49.385 --> 00:52:53.980
- Now you know. we have way
bigger fish to fry don't we?

713
00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:58.147
- I'm sorry. sweetheart.
she's been through a lot.

714
00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:03.023
- Tina was right.
instead of catching feelings.

715
00:53:03.023 --> 00:53:05.918
I needed to be catching a flight.

716
00:53:14.219 --> 00:53:16.096
You want something to drink?

717
00:53:16.096 --> 00:53:19.263
We got Pepsi. Kool-Aid. little Tito's.

718
00:53:20.673 --> 00:53:22.006
You got water?

719
00:53:31.763 --> 00:53:34.383
You look a little different in person.

720
00:53:34.383 --> 00:53:36.873
I mean. in a good way.

721
00:53:36.873 --> 00:53:39.203
you know bitches be
looking good as shit on TV

722
00:53:39.203 --> 00:53:43.705
and be ugly as shit in
person. know what I mean?

723
00:53:43.705 --> 00:53:45.568
Well. how was your flight?

724
00:53:45.568 --> 00:53:47.883
How was your private flight here. man?

725
00:53:47.883 --> 00:53:52.466
Is it more bumpier on the
private or the regular jawns?

726
00:53:53.483 --> 00:53:58.124
- You can feel the turbulence
more. but it was cool.

727
00:53:58.124 --> 00:54:00.052
So how did you meet Tina?

728
00:54:00.052 --> 00:54:03.777
I mean. was she Troy

729
00:54:03.777 --> 00:54:06.844
or Tina when y'all met?

730
00:54:08.316 --> 00:54:11.899
- She was Tina. we were
in the ninth grade.

731
00:54:12.776 --> 00:54:14.859
she helped me transition.

732
00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.017
Oh. that's what's up.

733
00:54:21.847 --> 00:54:26.347
So you ready to take this
nut ass nigga off the board?

734
00:54:30.108 --> 00:54:33.191
I'll be cashing in on this tonight.

735
00:54:48.926 --> 00:54:50.259
Boy. fuck you.

736
00:55:05.858 --> 00:55:09.469
Yo T it's lit baby. let's get it.

737
00:55:09.469 --> 00:55:10.469
I got you.

738
00:55:23.738 --> 00:55:26.653
- Hey. listen. let's
hope this your last trip

739
00:55:26.653 --> 00:55:28.747
that you make out here. man.

740
00:55:28.747 --> 00:55:31.711
'cause you coming in here
looking like Rihanna.

741
00:55:31.711 --> 00:55:34.047
you gotta turn that drip down. baby.

742
00:55:34.047 --> 00:55:36.487
This is Philly. this is not Hollywood.

743
00:55:36.487 --> 00:55:38.883
Niggas will rob for your designer shoes

744
00:55:38.883 --> 00:55:42.300
to that lace front on your head. you dig?

745
00:55:52.277 --> 00:55:54.136
Okay good. so his people don't want it

746
00:55:54.136 --> 00:55:55.137
to look like a suicide

747
00:55:55.137 --> 00:55:57.757
just as much as we don't want
it to look like a suicide.

748
00:55:57.757 --> 00:56:01.657
So the story is he was
simply cleaning off his gun

749
00:56:01.657 --> 00:56:02.990
and it went off.

750
00:56:04.117 --> 00:56:05.357
And as far as the marriage goes.

751
00:56:05.357 --> 00:56:07.916
they never got around to
even filing the paperwork.

752
00:56:07.916 --> 00:56:09.917
so we're all good there.

753
00:56:09.917 --> 00:56:12.027
Is Celess to show up at the funeral?

754
00:56:12.027 --> 00:56:15.516
- Absolutely. and Gerald
I'm gonna need for you

755
00:56:15.516 --> 00:56:17.367
to make her look so good that nobody

756
00:56:17.367 --> 00:56:20.851
could ever fathom that
she was a goddamn boy.

757
00:56:20.851 --> 00:56:22.057
Can you do that?

758
00:56:22.057 --> 00:56:23.658
Is a pig's pussy pork?

759
00:56:23.658 --> 00:56:27.263
If I can't. there ain't a bitch that can.

760
00:56:27.263 --> 00:56:29.913
- Alright gang let's
do some damage control.

761
00:56:38.063 --> 00:56:42.788
Our father who art in heaven.

762
00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:44.987
hallow be thy name.

763
00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.666
You know what time it is. right?

764
00:56:48.666 --> 00:56:51.762
Thy kingdom come.

765
00:56:51.762 --> 00:56:53.341
You sure those cameras off up there?

766
00:56:53.341 --> 00:56:54.174
Thy will be done.

767
00:56:54.174 --> 00:56:55.563
Yeah. I turned 'em off myself.

768
00:56:55.563 --> 00:56:58.082
Now quit questioning me
like it's your first rodeo.

769
00:56:58.082 --> 00:57:02.407
On Earth as it is in heaven.

770
00:57:04.867 --> 00:57:07.700
give us this day. our daily bread.

771
00:57:11.892 --> 00:57:14.475
and forgive us. our trespasses.

772
00:57:15.425 --> 00:57:19.092
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

773
00:57:20.802 --> 00:57:23.469
and lead us not into temptation.

774
00:57:27.286 --> 00:57:28.894
but deliver us from evil

775
00:57:30.869 --> 00:57:32.602
for thine is the kingdom.

776
00:57:33.502 --> 00:57:35.635
- This is for Tina. bitch.
- The power

777
00:57:38.852 --> 00:57:39.685
and the glory.

778
00:57:42.209 --> 00:57:44.642
forever and ever amen.

779
00:58:15.934 --> 00:58:16.925
A lot of people are saying

780
00:58:16.925 --> 00:58:19.673
that she's giving trans women a bad name

781
00:58:19.673 --> 00:58:23.003
making it seem like they all trick men.

782
00:58:23.003 --> 00:58:26.920
and Celess's behavior.
well. it sets them back.

783
00:58:29.448 --> 00:58:31.117
Like I'm not terrified that something

784
00:58:31.117 --> 00:58:33.205
like this will happen to me.

785
00:58:33.205 --> 00:58:38.122
This is how trans people die.
this is how trans people die.

786
00:59:12.819 --> 00:59:15.542
Si Si. what the hell is going on?

787
00:59:15.542 --> 00:59:17.090
That's what we trying to find out.

788
00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:19.611
I got Vicki on the other line. hold on.

789
00:59:19.611 --> 00:59:22.499
- Celess baby. your name
is all over every outlet.

790
00:59:22.499 --> 00:59:25.320
big and small. like how did this happen?

791
00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.844
I thought your folks was
taking care of everything.

792
00:59:27.844 --> 00:59:30.834
- If I'm reading the
headlines right. they did.

793
00:59:30.834 --> 00:59:33.284
Just a little too late. I guess.

794
00:59:33.284 --> 00:59:35.776
Yeah my phone's been ringing nonstop.

795
00:59:35.776 --> 00:59:40.026
I mean the LGBTYXY community
is up in fucking arms.

796
00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.584
I don't know why. if there's anybody

797
00:59:43.584 --> 00:59:45.814
that should understand
what Celess goes through

798
00:59:45.814 --> 00:59:48.134
and hell been through it should be them.

799
00:59:48.134 --> 00:59:50.474
Like. I don't have nothing
against the community.

800
00:59:50.474 --> 00:59:52.984
but they gonna leave my friend alone.

801
00:59:52.984 --> 00:59:54.539
No. we don't want no smoke with them.

802
00:59:54.539 --> 00:59:57.639
and they have the right
to feel how they feel.

803
00:59:57.639 --> 01:00:02.639
I mean. this does impact how
the world sees and treats them.

804
01:00:03.373 --> 01:00:05.906
- You see that's why I
didn't want this to get out.

805
01:00:05.906 --> 01:00:07.007
I don't want my story to be

806
01:00:07.007 --> 01:00:09.457
the representation of all trans stories.

807
01:00:09.457 --> 01:00:11.251
And that's gonna be our angle. okay?

808
01:00:11.251 --> 01:00:12.918
Listen. I'm gonna get with the team.

809
01:00:12.918 --> 01:00:14.552
I'm gonna have to re-strategize.

810
01:00:14.552 --> 01:00:17.669
In the meantime I'm gonna
change your flight to Monday.

811
01:00:17.669 --> 01:00:20.364
It's no way that you
could come back to LA.

812
01:00:20.364 --> 01:00:21.750
To be honest. the press is gonna be

813
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:23.730
on every airline strip everywhere

814
01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:26.187
from fucking here to San Diego.

815
01:00:26.187 --> 01:00:29.698
and honestly we not ready for
that line of questions yet.

816
01:00:29.698 --> 01:00:31.897
- Well. where is she
gonna go over the weekend.

817
01:00:31.897 --> 01:00:34.017
because as soon as the hotel staff realize

818
01:00:34.017 --> 01:00:35.929
that the girl all over the news

819
01:00:35.929 --> 01:00:38.989
is the same bitch staying
in the presidential suite.

820
01:00:38.989 --> 01:00:42.822
the local stations are
gonna get a phone call.

821
01:00:44.325 --> 01:00:45.863
Y'all hold on. this is my other line.

822
01:00:45.863 --> 01:00:48.196
and it's is a Philly number.

823
01:00:50.573 --> 01:00:52.939
- Hello?
- Char- I mean.

824
01:00:55.006 --> 01:00:56.463
Celess?

825
01:00:56.463 --> 01:00:57.296
Mom?

826
01:00:59.171 --> 01:01:00.242
Yeah.

827
01:01:00.242 --> 01:01:02.427
- I kept my number
the same all these years

828
01:01:02.427 --> 01:01:04.481
hoping my mom would reach out.

829
01:01:04.481 --> 01:01:05.842
but I didn't want it to be

830
01:01:05.842 --> 01:01:10.342
after she saw me dragged all
through the press though.

831
01:01:11.572 --> 01:01:14.447
Honey. I need to lay eyes on you.

832
01:01:14.447 --> 01:01:17.825
people want you dead like
they did your friend.

833
01:01:17.825 --> 01:01:20.785
all of this I had to
find it out on the news.

834
01:01:20.785 --> 01:01:22.646
I didn't even know Tina got killed.

835
01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:26.266
I didn't even know that
you almost got killed.

836
01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.821
Lord what kind of mother doesn't even know

837
01:01:27.821 --> 01:01:29.904
that about her own child?

838
01:01:30.741 --> 01:01:33.065
Please find your way back to me.

839
01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:37.925
You need to be somewhere
that's safe. you hear me?

840
01:01:37.925 --> 01:01:39.893
I'm gonna send you the address.

841
01:01:39.893 --> 01:01:40.876
Okay.

842
01:01:43.051 --> 01:01:45.742
Y'all that was my mom on the other line.

843
01:01:47.007 --> 01:01:48.517
She wants me to come home.

844
01:01:48.517 --> 01:01:50.997
so I might as well stay
with her before my flight.

845
01:01:50.997 --> 01:01:55.164
- See how God works.
- Bet. now let me get to work.

846
01:02:10.566 --> 01:02:13.066
- My baby. my baby?
- Mom. mom?

847
01:02:17.703 --> 01:02:19.870
I'm so glad you're back.

848
01:02:28.571 --> 01:02:32.282
- Celess Mitchell. you
need to come with us.

849
01:02:39.026 --> 01:02:40.461
For the life of me.

850
01:02:40.461 --> 01:02:43.961
I couldn't figure out why I was surprised.

851
01:02:43.961 --> 01:02:48.878
Everybody knows a zebra never
changes it's fucking stripes.

852
01:03:11.102 --> 01:03:12.829
He killed one of mine

853
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:16.189
and then he bragged about
it to a motherfucking blog?

854
01:03:16.189 --> 01:03:18.189
Shit. he deserves worse.

855
01:03:19.369 --> 01:03:22.438
and I pray to Satan that he gets it.

856
01:03:42.429 --> 01:03:46.179
- Wow your guardian
angels work at God speed.

857
01:03:49.169 --> 01:03:50.089
It looks like the person

858
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:52.213
that killed Khalil Allen has confessed.

859
01:03:52.213 --> 01:03:56.713
so we no longer need you for
questioning Ms. Mitchell.

860
01:03:58.307 --> 01:03:59.967
You're free.

861
01:03:59.967 --> 01:04:04.578
- Those words
played in my mind on repeat.

862
01:04:04.578 --> 01:04:05.411
and all I ever wanted.

863
01:04:05.411 --> 01:04:08.927
- Three. two. one.
- Hello. everyone.

864
01:04:08.927 --> 01:04:10.452
Was for them to be true.

865
01:04:10.452 --> 01:04:15.407
First. I would like to start
this off by saying. sorry.

866
01:04:15.407 --> 01:04:19.073
sorry to the LGBTQ
community. my community.

867
01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.498
I failed you.

868
01:04:23.803 --> 01:04:26.907
and it's because society has failed me.

869
01:04:26.907 --> 01:04:29.558
has failed us for too long.

870
01:04:29.558 --> 01:04:32.061
we've been forced to hide our true selves

871
01:04:32.061 --> 01:04:33.959
from people who are not like us

872
01:04:33.959 --> 01:04:37.419
in fear that they would disown us.

873
01:04:37.419 --> 01:04:42.069
displace us. dishonor us.
or completely destroy us.

874
01:04:43.088 --> 01:04:45.768
Now I'm not here pointing fingers

875
01:04:45.768 --> 01:04:49.108
without acknowledging the one
that's pointed back at me.

876
01:04:49.108 --> 01:04:53.201
I perpetuated a stereotype
out of desperation.

877
01:04:53.201 --> 01:04:55.951
but continued out of selfishness.

878
01:04:56.849 --> 01:05:00.828
and when that led to the
murder of my best friend

879
01:05:00.828 --> 01:05:03.048
I knew I had to change.

880
01:05:03.048 --> 01:05:05.768
but I didn't realize that the change

881
01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:08.529
wasn't just on the outside.

882
01:05:08.529 --> 01:05:12.659
If I wanted bad things to
stop reoccurring in my life.

883
01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:15.468
the change had to start from the inside

884
01:05:15.468 --> 01:05:17.712
and that change starts now.

885
01:05:17.712 --> 01:05:22.657
It starts with me accepting
the trans woman that I am.

886
01:05:22.657 --> 01:05:25.266
and I expect. no I demand.

887
01:05:26.918 --> 01:05:31.498
I demand that you all
accept us for who we are.

888
01:05:31.498 --> 01:05:33.831
All lesbians. all bisexuals.

889
01:05:34.758 --> 01:05:37.828
all gays. all nonconforming people.

890
01:05:37.828 --> 01:05:41.683
accept us all for who the fuck we are.

891
01:05:41.683 --> 01:05:45.350
and accept us for who
we love. respectfully.

892
01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:51.330
- Respectfully! I know
that's right. yup.

893
01:05:51.885 --> 01:05:52.885
Thank you.

894
01:05:54.749 --> 01:05:58.058
Sis. you did that.

895
01:05:59.775 --> 01:06:01.554
For a minute. I was nervous.

896
01:06:01.554 --> 01:06:03.574
especially when you went off script.

897
01:06:03.574 --> 01:06:05.624
but it was powerful though.

898
01:06:05.624 --> 01:06:08.200
and you turned that
acceptance thing back on them.

899
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.700
Bitch I shed two tears. not one but two.

900
01:06:13.529 --> 01:06:16.696
Vicki. how you think it went. Vicki?

901
01:06:17.559 --> 01:06:18.392
Oh. I'm sorry y'all.

902
01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:20.716
I was getting a ton of interview requests.

903
01:06:20.716 --> 01:06:25.299
- Well. Si Si that should
tell you exactly how it went.

904
01:06:32.116 --> 01:06:35.449
- Get down!

905
01:06:41.586 --> 01:06:44.586
- Oh!
- Gerald. call 9-1-1!

906
01:06:45.907 --> 01:06:46.740
Celess. Si Si.

907
01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.261
y'all get out of here
before the press come.

908
01:06:48.261 --> 01:06:50.213
But what about Vicki?

909
01:06:50.213 --> 01:06:54.100
- We will get her to
the hospital. y'all go.

910
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.286
He's right y'all.

911
01:06:55.286 --> 01:06:57.579
Vicki wouldn't want this to
overshadow the press conference.

912
01:06:57.579 --> 01:07:00.579
- Go home.
- Si Si. let's go. let's go.

913
01:07:17.979 --> 01:07:20.812
Fuck. that motherfucking Khalil.

914
01:07:21.728 --> 01:07:24.414
I bet you it was a revenge plot.

915
01:07:24.414 --> 01:07:27.312
Just like he gave me up to the blogs.

916
01:07:27.312 --> 01:07:29.836
he arranged this shit.

917
01:07:29.836 --> 01:07:32.485
That wasn't Khalil's work.

918
01:07:32.485 --> 01:07:36.799
- Naw. sis somebody in that
damn prison told him something.

919
01:07:36.799 --> 01:07:40.369
- Celess listen to me.
- They had to!

920
01:07:40.369 --> 01:07:44.452
- That right there had
nothing to do with Khalil.

921
01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:49.539
Celess I gotta tell you something.

922
01:07:49.539 --> 01:07:52.206
Here come them damn skeletons.

923
01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:57.819
A few years ago.

924
01:08:00.834 --> 01:08:04.001
Why you asking me about your father?

925
01:08:05.475 --> 01:08:07.142
He's not here. I am.

926
01:08:08.308 --> 01:08:10.553
I'm the one that afforded
all these luxuries.

927
01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:13.534
I'm the one that paid for
your language lessons.

928
01:08:13.534 --> 01:08:15.511
I'm the one that allowed
you to travel the world.

929
01:08:15.511 --> 01:08:18.170
All for your own benefit.

930
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:21.910
so you could get top dollar for me.

931
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:24.750
It's why you took me in
the first place. isn't it?

932
01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.490
So you could raise me to
be your biggest earner.

933
01:08:26.490 --> 01:08:28.657
like a goddamn race horse.

934
01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:38.437
- Speaking about high horses.
you ain't on yours now.

935
01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.517
You killed my father. didn't you?

936
01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:47.080
You killed my father and took
me from my mother. didn't you?

937
01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.913
- And if I did the fuck
you gonna do about it?

938
01:08:58.985 --> 01:09:01.485
So what did you do about it?

939
01:09:08.626 --> 01:09:11.576
- Listen. I'm gonna need
another set of documents

940
01:09:11.576 --> 01:09:15.430
for my mom. for when I
find her. and 250 grand.

941
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:17.778
Documents won't be a problem.

942
01:09:17.778 --> 01:09:19.867
but a quarter million dollars.

943
01:09:19.867 --> 01:09:22.967
that's a lot to drain from the agency.

944
01:09:22.967 --> 01:09:24.152
Do you understand?

945
01:09:24.152 --> 01:09:27.473
We're gonna have to start
our lives over from scratch.

946
01:09:27.473 --> 01:09:28.862
I'm really not asking for enough.

947
01:09:28.862 --> 01:09:31.362
I should be asking for double.

948
01:09:33.052 --> 01:09:35.469
Okay. I'll get you the 250.

949
01:09:37.354 --> 01:09:40.932
Now this man has trafficked
thousands of young girls

950
01:09:40.932 --> 01:09:43.642
for almost two decades.

951
01:09:43.642 --> 01:09:47.762
Let's just get this
monster off the streets.

952
01:09:47.762 --> 01:09:50.792
- Okay. so your guys
might wanna be careful

953
01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:52.932
because he usually has guys outside

954
01:09:52.932 --> 01:09:56.412
that patrol the whole situation.

955
01:10:04.511 --> 01:10:07.961
- Nyla. how is she?
- She's gone.

956
01:10:10.464 --> 01:10:11.797
They killed her.

957
01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:16.587
Celess you need to listen to me.

958
01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:20.186
Chatman is dangerous and powerful.

959
01:10:20.186 --> 01:10:23.506
and as soon as he finds out I survived.

960
01:10:23.506 --> 01:10:25.386
he's coming after me.

961
01:10:25.386 --> 01:10:27.106
That sounds like a personal problem

962
01:10:27.106 --> 01:10:28.905
that ain't got shit to do with you.

963
01:10:28.905 --> 01:10:32.095
Drop her off and take your ass home.

964
01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:34.762
Shit Si Si. what you gonna do?

965
01:10:38.718 --> 01:10:41.468
Google what time it is in Rome?

966
01:10:42.351 --> 01:10:45.163
- Rome as in Italy?
- Yes.

967
01:10:45.163 --> 01:10:47.918
You know that bunker we stayed in?

968
01:10:47.918 --> 01:10:51.527
That didn't belong to a guy I dog sat for.

969
01:10:51.527 --> 01:10:53.926
it belongs to a friend of
mine who stays in Rome.

970
01:10:53.926 --> 01:10:56.207
and he's the only one I know

971
01:10:56.207 --> 01:10:58.366
that can match Chatman's energy.

972
01:10:58.366 --> 01:11:02.257
and at this point I gotta
fight power with power.

973
01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:05.316
Shit Si Si. what are you into?

974
01:11:06.486 --> 01:11:08.439
And it's like 6:00 AM over there.

975
01:11:08.439 --> 01:11:10.272
Shit I hope he's up.

976
01:11:19.518 --> 01:11:21.351
- Ciao.
- Andrew. Ciao.

977
01:11:22.498 --> 01:11:24.538
It's me. Si Si.

978
01:11:24.538 --> 01:11:25.789
I hate to call you like this.

979
01:11:25.789 --> 01:11:29.828
but I need a favor much
bigger than the last one.

980
01:11:29.828 --> 01:11:32.878
Ah Si Si my dear. what is it?

981
01:11:32.878 --> 01:11:36.772
- I need to get out of the
country. Chatman found me.

982
01:11:36.772 --> 01:11:40.428
That's impossible. he got 42 years.

983
01:11:40.428 --> 01:11:42.323
He's going to die in prison.

984
01:11:42.323 --> 01:11:44.161
That's what I thought.

985
01:11:44.161 --> 01:11:46.453
but he just shot and
killed a friend of mine.

986
01:11:46.453 --> 01:11:50.953
and I know people like to
think bullets have no names.

987
01:11:52.094 --> 01:11:55.294
but that one definitely had my name on it.

988
01:11:55.294 --> 01:11:57.912
I need to get outta here. quick.

989
01:11:57.912 --> 01:12:01.328
- Shit. are you still in LA?
- Yes.

990
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.786
- Okay. listen I'm gonna
call up my pilot out there.

991
01:12:06.786 --> 01:12:09.591
Okay. you go get some somewhere safe.

992
01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:12.580
if you need to go back
to the bunker. do it.

993
01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.660
I'll call you back.

994
01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:15.743
Okay thank you. Andrew.

995
01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.563
I guess you're going to Rome.

996
01:12:33.993 --> 01:12:37.889
- And honestly. Celess.
you should come with me.

997
01:12:37.889 --> 01:12:39.709
Let things die down some.

998
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:42.031
let the cops catch up to Chatman.

999
01:12:42.031 --> 01:12:45.399
because I know he didn't get
no get outta jail free card.

1000
01:12:45.399 --> 01:12:47.583
knowing him he done fucking escaped.

1001
01:12:47.583 --> 01:12:51.666
and then once he's back
in custody. we come back.

1002
01:12:53.819 --> 01:12:58.119
- Again we don't have
details on who has been shot

1003
01:12:58.119 --> 01:12:59.869
or if it was fatal yet.

1004
01:12:59.869 --> 01:13:02.239
but there has been a shooting
in downtown Los Angeles

1005
01:13:02.239 --> 01:13:04.650
involving Celess Mitchell and her team.

1006
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:06.159
This immediately following

1007
01:13:06.159 --> 01:13:09.159
her groundbreaking press conference.

1008
01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.017
- Hello?
- Celess.

1009
01:13:14.419 --> 01:13:16.059
Where are you. and. and are you okay?

1010
01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:18.529
I just saw you on the news.

1011
01:13:18.529 --> 01:13:22.421
I'm not okay. Derrek. no. but I'm alive.

1012
01:13:23.338 --> 01:13:24.414
- Did this have anything to do with-

1013
01:13:24.414 --> 01:13:27.089
- I'll talk to you about it
in person. can I come by?

1014
01:13:27.089 --> 01:13:28.589
Sure. of course.

1015
01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:33.604
Hey. it's your mother.

1016
01:13:33.604 --> 01:13:36.243
I understand why you
wouldn't answer my call.

1017
01:13:36.243 --> 01:13:39.910
but I just wanna make
sure that you're okay.

1018
01:13:40.978 --> 01:13:44.385
Please. please be okay Celess.

1019
01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:47.754
please.

1020
01:13:49.912 --> 01:13:50.745
Oh my God.

1021
01:13:51.607 --> 01:13:53.646
Please be okay.

1022
01:13:53.646 --> 01:13:56.979
You go ahead sis. I'm gonna stay here.

1023
01:13:59.203 --> 01:14:01.199
I think I'll be okay.

1024
01:14:01.199 --> 01:14:05.546
and plus I need to be
here for Gerald and Nyla.

1025
01:14:05.546 --> 01:14:06.379
Exactly.

1026
01:14:22.576 --> 01:14:25.036
Look. if you change your mind

1027
01:14:25.036 --> 01:14:28.786
in the next couple hours
meet me at Van Nuys.

1028
01:14:29.841 --> 01:14:31.983
I'm texting you the tail number.

1029
01:14:34.016 --> 01:14:35.249
it takes off at 11 okay?

1030
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:43.638
And be safe

1031
01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:48.819
and give Gerald and Nyla

1032
01:14:48.819 --> 01:14:50.902
a tight hug for me. okay?

1033
01:14:52.781 --> 01:14:55.668
And let them know I'm so sorry.

1034
01:15:28.252 --> 01:15:31.208
- So I didn't know if I
should go with her or-

1035
01:15:31.208 --> 01:15:32.041
Right.

1036
01:15:33.674 --> 01:15:35.749
Oh.

1037
01:15:37.705 --> 01:15:40.082
Celess it's not what you think.

1038
01:15:40.082 --> 01:15:42.056
Michael reached out to me
after everything blew up

1039
01:15:42.056 --> 01:15:46.517
and he wanted to come out to
LA to make things right by you.

1040
01:15:46.517 --> 01:15:50.427
He came out here to give you his support.

1041
01:15:50.427 --> 01:15:52.997
Celess don't worry.

1042
01:15:52.997 --> 01:15:57.414
I got everything off my
chest the last time we spoke.

1043
01:16:00.234 --> 01:16:03.484
and I've been regretting it ever since.

1044
01:16:04.434 --> 01:16:07.915
Remember when you told me
that the person I loved

1045
01:16:07.915 --> 01:16:09.665
was still right here.

1046
01:16:11.684 --> 01:16:14.101
Well. is that still the case?

1047
01:16:20.914 --> 01:16:25.581
- How I had any tears
left was a mystery to me.

1048
01:16:26.419 --> 01:16:31.008
but trust. these were happy tears.

1049
01:16:31.008 --> 01:16:34.515
Someone's at the door. you two connect.

1050
01:16:34.515 --> 01:16:35.565
make yourselves at home.

1051
01:16:35.565 --> 01:16:37.148
I'll be right back.

1052
01:16:47.317 --> 01:16:48.150
Walk up.

1053
01:16:49.645 --> 01:16:52.185
James. what. what are you doing here?

1054
01:16:52.185 --> 01:16:55.352
Go sit over there with your friends.

1055
01:16:57.376 --> 01:16:59.435
What did I say Celess?

1056
01:16:59.435 --> 01:17:00.505
What did I say was gonna happen to you

1057
01:17:00.505 --> 01:17:03.415
if I ever saw your ass again.

1058
01:17:03.415 --> 01:17:05.734
James. you said. if you ever saw me out.

1059
01:17:05.734 --> 01:17:08.439
if I ever looked in your direction.

1060
01:17:08.439 --> 01:17:10.665
you didn't see me out.

1061
01:17:10.665 --> 01:17:12.080
you came to me. you came to where I-

1062
01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.216
- Well what the fuck you
thought was gonna happen

1063
01:17:13.216 --> 01:17:16.716
when you put a hit out on my brother. huh?

1064
01:17:17.871 --> 01:17:20.163
You thought I wasn't gonna
come see you about this?

1065
01:17:20.163 --> 01:17:22.287
James I swear to God.

1066
01:17:22.287 --> 01:17:25.075
I had nothing to do with
Khalil being killed.

1067
01:17:25.075 --> 01:17:27.845
So it was all just a coincidence. huh?

1068
01:17:27.845 --> 01:17:31.215
The day before my brother's
throat gets slashed.

1069
01:17:31.215 --> 01:17:33.565
he calls me saying that
anything happen to him

1070
01:17:33.565 --> 01:17:36.654
to forward these goddamn emails.

1071
01:17:36.654 --> 01:17:41.500
Emails ain't doing nothing
but exposing your ass. Celess.

1072
01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.870
- So you're the one who
outed me to the blogs?

1073
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:45.953
Me out you?

1074
01:17:47.272 --> 01:17:50.875
Nah. outing you would
be like outing myself.

1075
01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:51.948
Obviously I ain't the only one

1076
01:17:51.948 --> 01:17:53.926
that received that phone call.

1077
01:17:53.926 --> 01:17:55.487
James Allen. right?

1078
01:17:55.487 --> 01:17:57.227
Look. you play for the Lakers.

1079
01:17:57.227 --> 01:17:59.627
You don't have to do this. man.

1080
01:17:59.627 --> 01:18:01.210
Shut the fuck up.

1081
01:18:02.369 --> 01:18:05.897
- Oh. you gonna have to
kill them all now baby bro.

1082
01:18:05.897 --> 01:18:09.596
- Celess. Derrek keeps a gun
in the cushion of the couch.

1083
01:18:09.596 --> 01:18:10.596
Every last one of them.

1084
01:18:24.376 --> 01:18:28.959
- Sis. what time does
that plane leave to Rome?

1085
01:18:34.198 --> 01:18:35.198
Thank you.

1086
01:18:59.266 --> 01:19:00.624
Si Si. I fucked up.

1087
01:19:02.382 --> 01:19:03.215
I fucked up.

1088
01:19:04.058 --> 01:19:05.725
- You get the head.
I'll get the legs. okay?

1089
01:19:05.725 --> 01:19:08.308
- Okay. gotcha.
- Ready?

1090
01:19:23.574 --> 01:19:24.407
Listen

1091
01:19:27.615 --> 01:19:28.448
I understand

1092
01:19:28.448 --> 01:19:32.369
if you don't want me
to go with you anymore.

1093
01:19:32.369 --> 01:19:36.486
I mean. I'm sure what you're doing.

1094
01:19:38.778 --> 01:19:42.348
helping me flee or whatever
is against the law.

1095
01:19:42.348 --> 01:19:46.931
- Celess stop I meant it when
I said I owe you my life.

1096
01:19:47.848 --> 01:19:52.208
So no matter what happens.
we are in this shit together.

1097
01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:54.125
I got you. you hear me?

1098
01:19:55.988 --> 01:19:58.905
Now try your best to get some rest.

1099
01:20:03.828 --> 01:20:05.019
That's my cue.

1100
01:20:07.444 --> 01:20:09.619
you don't need me anymore sis.

1101
01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:16.141
you got everything you need
in that one right there.

1102
01:20:18.208 --> 01:20:19.041
This whole time I'm thinking

1103
01:20:19.041 --> 01:20:20.958
you gonna find unconditional love.

1104
01:20:20.958 --> 01:20:24.263
and I'm thinking it's
gonna be from a nigga.

1105
01:20:24.263 --> 01:20:26.146
but who's to say it can't be from a bitch.

1106
01:20:26.146 --> 01:20:27.813
long as she's solid.

1107
01:20:32.002 --> 01:20:34.758
Now I might not be going with you to Rome.

1108
01:20:34.758 --> 01:20:37.008
but you gonna see me again.

1109
01:20:39.138 --> 01:20:43.405
- I love you. sis.
- I love you too. sis.

1110
01:20:44.428 --> 01:20:47.928
- Always.
