3
00:01:00.128 --> 00:01:03.231
Our story
starts hundreds of years ago

4
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:05.933
when the only daughter
of an 18th-century

5
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:10.604
aristocratic family. who was
betrothed to Javanese royalty.

6
00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:13.707
renounced everything.

7
00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:16.344
Her title. her riches.

8
00:01:16.344 --> 00:01:18.712
much to her family's
displeasure.

9
00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:23.784
She was Marshanda Damayanti.
the princess pirate.

10
00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:48.709
She fled a life

11
00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.112
of confinement to live
unchained and unfettered.

12
00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:54.948
plundering the South China Sea.

13
00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:57.751
where she formed a new family.

14
00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:02.223
a loyal crew of women she
saved from the shackles

15
00:02:02.223 --> 00:02:04.492
of servitude or title.

16
00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.938
it was on the high seas
she forged a friendship

17
00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:21.008
with a notorious
pirate. Red Cat Morgan.

18
00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.612
Together. they ruled the
waves. becoming each other's

19
00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:26.247
only true ally.

20
00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:29.817
but their past was
never far behind.

21
00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:34.822
Victims of their ravage. hell
bent on tracking them down.

22
00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:37.191
wanting retribution in blood.

23
00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:42.496
When her pursuers
eventually closed in.

24
00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:45.433
Marshanda entrusted her
share of the riches to Red.

25
00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:48.969
who in turn gave her a wrist
device that would lead her back

26
00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.771
to Red and the treasure.

27
00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:55.776
She then headed towards the
frozen waters of the Antarctic.

28
00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:57.978
so desperate to escape
that she went somewhere

29
00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:00.080
no one would dare follow.

30
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.484
But tragically. her ship
was lost to the ice.

31
00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:08.456
lost for hundreds
of years until now.

32
00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:50.257
Up here.

33
00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:54.562
Stuart. we have one of
those homeless again.

34
00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:59.767
Get Mr. Walsh

35
00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:01.001
down here immediately.

36
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.206
Hey!

37
00:05:14.882 --> 00:05:16.417
Get her out of here!

38
00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:19.953
Get the boss! Get Mr Walsh!

39
00:05:25.593 --> 00:05:28.762
Daddy. she's hungry. catch.

40
00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.211
She did not pay
for that spring roll.

41
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:46.480
Tase her. Gary.

42
00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:41.101
Mia. Mia.

43
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.403
Mia.

44
00:06:44.772 --> 00:06:46.339
Those toilets is blocked again.

45
00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:50.243
and I've got a big meeting with
this finance tosser Collins.

46
00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.679
He's in the bar
waiting right now

47
00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:53.447
and the timing's terrible.

48
00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:57.851
You know. sometimes
I think it's a sign.

49
00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:00.721
You know. sometimes I think
you want me to lose this bar.

50
00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:05.225
Hmm?

51
00:07:07.695 --> 00:07:09.863
Fine. I'll do
it. give it here.

52
00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:12.533
Oh. I love the way
you unblock a toilet.

53
00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:13.433
Ew.

54
00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.185
Sorry. sorry.

55
00:07:34.922 --> 00:07:35.823
What is.

56
00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:45.065
I don't speak. I'm really sorry.

57
00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:46.734
listen. I don't.
I'm from Croydon.

58
00:07:49.537 --> 00:07:50.971
Do you know Croydon?

59
00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:58.311
You're hiding from
someone. is that it?

60
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.615
It's going to be okay.

61
00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:09.657
Excuse me.

62
00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:11.825
Did you see a woman run
through this way just now?

63
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:13.026
- A lady in the medical gown?
- Yes.

64
00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:15.529
Yeah. she shoved
me and went that way.

65
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:17.631
She just left. you might
still be able to catch her.

66
00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:19.600
Thank
you. Thank you.

67
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.134
Police!

68
00:08:21.134 --> 00:08:22.402
That was so exciting.

69
00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:23.971
I've never lied to
the police before.

70
00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:26.273
Oh crap.

71
00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:28.642
are you an escaped killer
on a violent rampage?

72
00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:33.513
Oh. let's just get you inside.

73
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.183
There's food inside. food.

74
00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:40.888
I have an idea.

75
00:08:40.888 --> 00:08:42.355
Here. take this.

76
00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:44.057
Catch.

77
00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:47.460
Wait. wait. no. no. no.
no. I promise. wait. wait.

78
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.464
More. good. good.

79
00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:52.666
Oh. no. no. don't. don't.

80
00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:06.880
You want another one.
you got it. that's it.

81
00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:15.022
This guy. he didn't do anything.

82
00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:16.456
just gave vague promises.

83
00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:19.727
Hey. it's okay.

84
00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.734
Time to distract Eddie.

85
00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:36.944
- Eddie!
- Where you been?

86
00:09:38.045 --> 00:09:41.481
The toilets are blocked.
don't worry about it.

87
00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:44.551
Oh. careful. oh my
God. Eddie. come on.

88
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.873
State of that shitty bar.

89
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.769
Yeah. I like it. too.

90
00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:10.603
It's Skip's great. great. no.

great. great. great. great.

92
00:11:13.707 --> 00:11:15.308
had a commission or something.

93
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.982
You all right. Benny?

94
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.766
Mia. can I trouble
you for another?

95
00:11:38.766 --> 00:11:40.000
Yeah. of course.

96
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.835
Hey. how's sick leave going?

97
00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:42.903
Oh. you know.

98
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:47.607
another day on the right side
of the grass and oh. lovely.

99
00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:49.609
let me keep the box.

100
00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:52.846
Very nice. fair

101
00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:54.314
Oh. yes. please.

102
00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:55.548
Eddie made me something called

103
00:11:55.548 --> 00:12:00.120
discharge of the
light brigade. ugh.

104
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.588
No worries. leave it with me.

105
00:12:17.704 --> 00:12:20.607
We need to get you
unhooked from this taser.

106
00:12:20.607 --> 00:12:23.076
This is gonna suck. but. hey.

107
00:12:31.785 --> 00:12:35.055
I'm sorry. I think I understood
that and I'm really. really.

108
00:12:35.055 --> 00:12:38.658
I'm really sorry. I'm so
sorry. I'm so sorry. bear with.

109
00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.695
I'm so sorry. bear with.
bear with. breathe.

110
00:12:44.064 --> 00:12:46.433
Let's get you into something
a little less conspicuous.

111
00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:51.939
Looks good.

112
00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:55.308
Let's see.

113
00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:01.248
It's amazing what people
leave behind in pubs

114
00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:02.715
after a few pints. honestly.

115
00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:07.687
These look like they'll
fit. so try these on.

116
00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:17.564
Okay. let's get you some
real food. all right.

117
00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:21.101
What do you fancy. scampi
fries. beef crisps?

118
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:23.503
Are you vegetarian.
because that's all we have?

119
00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:29.176
Right. you might
be a mass murderer

120
00:13:29.176 --> 00:13:31.144
and I'm here asking about
your dietary requirements.

121
00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.413
I'm an idiot. okay.
please stay. all right.

122
00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:34.414
I'll be right back.

123
00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:41.288
Hey. hey. ready
yourselves for another

124
00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:44.824
delightful concoction from
London's greatest mixologist.

125
00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:48.528
I call this one. angel jizz.

126
00:13:48.528 --> 00:13:52.032
Welcome explorers to
the Smugglers Tavern.

127
00:13:52.032 --> 00:13:54.968
the pirate's private
party palace.

128
00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:58.405
This is the most historically
infamous sordid den

129
00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:00.073
of villainy and
underworld chicanery

130
00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:02.509
that ever was in
old London town.

131
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.144
And it's here our
walking tour of London

132
00:14:04.144 --> 00:14:07.981
shall pause for refreshments
and use of the facilities.

133
00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:10.283
Mine's a Brandy Alexander
if anyone's buying.

134
00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:12.419
No?

135
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.121
No?

136
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:17.124
Fair enough.

137
00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:32.906
Argh. froze banana. bone sack.

138
00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:37.844
I need to talk to step
to Skip about our deal.

139
00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:38.745
He's busy.

140
00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.382
- Just get him.
- I just said he's busy.

141
00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.283
Please.

142
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.574
- I'm not selling.
- Mr. Walsh is offering--

143
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:08.741
I'm not selling!

144
00:15:10.077 --> 00:15:11.578
I know it's been
in your family for generations.

145
00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:16.216
- but you need to think about--
- I will not change my mind.

146
00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:18.585
Fine. Mr. Walsh
won't be happy.

147
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.926
Hey. look. I know you're
really doing everything you can

148
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.695
to help out. but is
there anything you can do

149
00:15:28.695 --> 00:15:30.863
to just help out
a little bit more?

150
00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:34.601
Well. if he doesn't pay
any of you this month.

151
00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:38.605
he might just scrape by.
but what about next month?

152
00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:42.542
Hey. don't worry.

153
00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:46.046
You can always be a
barmaid somewhere else.

154
00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:47.714
It's not the only pub in London.

155
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:20.113
Eddie will
be with you shortly.

156
00:16:22.082 --> 00:16:23.250
Skip is missing his cue.

157
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.517
He's in the
middle of something.

158
00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:26.219
Shit. here. tell
this lovely girl.

159
00:16:26.219 --> 00:16:27.454
- Woman.
- Woman. about

160
00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:29.756
the dastardly dealings
of the Smugglers Tavern.

161
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.993
We do two for one cocktails
between now and six.

162
00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:34.894
Nice.

163
00:16:35.795 --> 00:16:36.696
Cocktails.

164
00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:42.469
Actually. let me go find
this general knowledge expert

165
00:16:42.469 --> 00:16:44.071
who knows a lot more than I do.

166
00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:47.840
Lots of the legends
here are true.

167
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.044
it's a most
mysterious place this.

168
00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:55.415
Before the great
fire. it was 1666.

169
00:16:56.816 --> 00:17:01.688
lots of nefarious stuff. and
right here. I mean this bar.

170
00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:06.326
it's built right on
top of the lost rivers

171
00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:11.398
and caves of London. all lost

172
00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:14.401
when they rebuilt
post-fire apparently.

173
00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:24.077
To reach your destination.
you must leave the shore.

174
00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:28.047
Ah. yes. the maxim
of ferocious pirate Catherine Morgan.

175
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:29.882
or Red Cat. as she was known.

176
00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.051
Oh yeah. because
she had nine lives.

177
00:17:39.626 --> 00:17:41.428
Cat
discovered a baby kraken

178
00:17:41.428 --> 00:17:43.130
orphaned from its mother.

179
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:47.467
She cared for this
krakling. naming her Lucy.

180
00:17:47.467 --> 00:17:51.238
a fierce protector of the
pirate who raised her.

181
00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.793
Red Cat spent years
trying to find a friend.

182
00:18:13.793 --> 00:18:16.696
eventually Cat turned up here.

183
00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:19.065
Her last hope was that
her friend would follow

184
00:18:19.065 --> 00:18:21.968
in her footsteps to the
infamous Smugglers Tavern.

185
00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:25.238
known as a black market for
trading pillaged riches.

186
00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:29.276
Allegedly. she left
a trail of clues

187
00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:32.412
should Marshanda return
to claim her share

188
00:18:32.412 --> 00:18:36.583
before Cat herself became
nothing more than legend.

189
00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:44.023
The man being shot by Red
Cat in the painting bears

190
00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:46.859
a likeness to Skip's
forefather who owned the tavern

191
00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:50.029
at the time. leading many
to believe Skip's family

192
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:51.998
were more involved
in the sordid deeds

193
00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:54.401
of this notorious
pirate than we know.

194
00:18:57.537 --> 00:19:01.808
Cool. I'll take two of
those cocktails please.

195
00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.810
Kraken. it's a nice touch.

196
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.313
I actually love the kraken.

197
00:19:25.565 --> 00:19:27.300
I hope you enjoy
daylong sci-fi sessions

198
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.636
with an unwashed flacid ape man.

199
00:19:29.636 --> 00:19:31.137
He feeds off
self-esteem. this one.

200
00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:32.605
so I'd look out for that. yeah.

201
00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:33.906
Hey. Eddie. can
you pass me a water?

202
00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:35.074
Hey. check this out.

203
00:19:35.074 --> 00:19:36.809
See this fool over there?

204
00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:39.946
So she used to date him

205
00:19:41.214 --> 00:19:42.549
and it looks like
they've dragged new dates

206
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:43.750
to the same place.

207
00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.521
Why don't you kick
this date into phase two

208
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:49.922
and just shit off to Nando's.

209
00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:51.791
You shit off to
Nando's. you ponce.

210
00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:53.926
Eddie. the water.

211
00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:58.231
Thank you.

212
00:19:58.231 --> 00:20:01.167
Oh. hey. They've called down.

213
00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:03.903
delivery's waiting. been up
there for about 10 minutes.

214
00:20:03.903 --> 00:20:05.372
10 minute. ugh.

215
00:20:08.074 --> 00:20:10.109
You can stick your apology.

216
00:20:21.688 --> 00:20:23.723
Hey. well done. another
delivery's been nicked.

217
00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.191
This one's on you. Eddie.

218
00:20:25.191 --> 00:20:27.360
Come on. don't
be like that. Mia.

219
00:20:29.362 --> 00:20:31.531
Skip. Eddie did not--

220
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.272
Run. Mia. run!

221
00:21:48.908 --> 00:21:50.610
Are you all right
down there. Skip?

222
00:21:51.511 --> 00:21:53.312
I think so.

223
00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.114
Call an ambulance. Eddie.

224
00:22:05.625 --> 00:22:07.927
Hey. don't kill him. don't.

225
00:22:10.463 --> 00:22:11.964
Ya.

226
00:22:11.964 --> 00:22:12.865
Ya.

227
00:22:32.885 --> 00:22:36.122
That was the same crest as
the restaurant next door.

228
00:22:36.122 --> 00:22:37.824
Hey. what does this mean?

229
00:22:46.032 --> 00:22:48.134
Her vocal sound obliterated.
that's not healthy.

230
00:22:48.134 --> 00:22:50.169
Sounds like you've been
doing eight Phantoms a week.

231
00:22:50.169 --> 00:22:51.704
That's serious.

232
00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:52.505
I can fix this.

233
00:22:54.273 --> 00:22:55.141
Skip!

234
00:22:56.409 --> 00:22:57.844
Oh. hey. you
can't be back here.

235
00:22:57.844 --> 00:23:00.680
Yep. just knocking together
a cheeky vocal tonic.

236
00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.382
Eddie. they cut the landline
before roughing me up.

237
00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:06.986
That's another thing
I. ow. to pay for.

238
00:23:06.986 --> 00:23:07.887
Oh yeah?

239
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:11.724
See. if I was 15 years younger.

240
00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:14.093
I'd throw you about like
an empty track suit.

241
00:23:15.027 --> 00:23:15.928
What's this?

242
00:23:18.898 --> 00:23:23.936
Gun powder and this is
why you can't be back here.

243
00:23:24.837 --> 00:23:26.105
All right.

244
00:23:30.943 --> 00:23:32.879
Hey. you're a bright bulb.

245
00:23:32.879 --> 00:23:34.914
maybe you can communicate
with her. what's she saying?

246
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:36.516
I'll see what I can do.

247
00:23:36.516 --> 00:23:38.184
Wanna get some ice on that.

248
00:23:38.184 --> 00:23:39.819
There's no signal down here.

249
00:23:39.819 --> 00:23:41.353
- I know.
- Right. I'll go up

250
00:23:41.353 --> 00:23:42.689
and call the police.

251
00:23:49.729 --> 00:23:51.831
I don't think the
police can help her.

252
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:53.099
What is she looking for?

253
00:23:55.602 --> 00:23:57.537
Hey. who were those guys?

254
00:23:59.906 --> 00:24:03.075
Just some people who want
to cash in on Mummy's fortune.

255
00:24:04.744 --> 00:24:07.279
I can't even afford
to keep the lights on

256
00:24:08.581 --> 00:24:10.650
and they can smell the
blood in the water.

257
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:13.753
So I'm gonna have to sell.

258
00:24:16.623 --> 00:24:18.457
I let my father down.

259
00:24:20.026 --> 00:24:22.695
I can help you.
I've been saving up.

260
00:24:22.695 --> 00:24:26.332
Oh. Mia. no. I
can't do that again.

261
00:24:26.332 --> 00:24:28.100
Yes. please. yes you can.

262
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.469
It's fine. you can owe me.

263
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:31.938
I can't.

264
00:24:31.938 --> 00:24:35.374
- Skip. please. it's fine.
- Mia. no.

265
00:24:36.776 --> 00:24:38.177
It's only a bar.

266
00:24:39.078 --> 00:24:40.312
It's a home.

267
00:24:42.114 --> 00:24:43.015
I can't.

268
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.251
I can't.

269
00:24:50.056 --> 00:24:51.190
It's not up to you.

270
00:24:52.058 --> 00:24:53.593
I'm gonna help you.

271
00:24:54.761 --> 00:24:56.495
I won't be needing
this anytime soon.

272
00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:58.164
So much for traveling the world.

273
00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:00.332
Come on. you.

274
00:25:06.773 --> 00:25:09.008
Okay. let's see how get
this translation app is.

275
00:25:09.008 --> 00:25:11.010
You're welcome.

276
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.316
Language not recognized.

277
00:25:19.118 --> 00:25:21.988
- See if you can translate.
- Do your thing.

278
00:25:26.092 --> 00:25:27.860
Who are you?

279
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.962
- Marshanda Damayanti.
- Marshanda?

280
00:25:29.962 --> 00:25:32.364
- Marshanda.
- I'm Mia.

281
00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:34.166
Mia.

282
00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:35.802
- Mia.
- Yes. Mia.

283
00:25:35.802 --> 00:25:36.703
Marshanda.

284
00:25:38.404 --> 00:25:42.341
Sod this shithole.
ladies to champers.

285
00:25:45.912 --> 00:25:47.914
The police
are on their way.

286
00:25:50.449 --> 00:25:52.719
Danger.

287
00:25:52.719 --> 00:25:54.721
Danger.

288
00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:58.758
Hey. police are gonna
be here in a little bit.

289
00:25:58.758 --> 00:26:00.392
And I don't want my
friend to get in trouble.

290
00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:02.461
Can she come with you
just for a short while?

291
00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:04.731
I'll come find her and
drinks will be on me.

292
00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:06.565
Abso-bloody-lutely.

293
00:26:07.934 --> 00:26:09.101
Tell her
that she needs to go

294
00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:11.370
and I'll come find her then.

295
00:26:14.741 --> 00:26:16.175
Go.

296
00:26:16.175 --> 00:26:18.344
She'll be safe with us.

297
00:26:22.314 --> 00:26:25.184
None of you saw
her. especially you.

298
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.123
I'm not supposed to go
anywhere until the police.

299
00:26:31.123 --> 00:26:32.725
I will buy you shots.

300
00:26:32.725 --> 00:26:34.360
I will get you to. stop.

301
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.828
they're surprisingly strong.

302
00:26:39.098 --> 00:26:41.267
Oh. no. no. no. go. go.

303
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.437
Go on then.

304
00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.573
I can't.

305
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.713
I can't leave them.

306
00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.453
No. wait. what you doing?

307
00:27:03.322 --> 00:27:07.393
- Did you call the police?
- Yes. yes. I did.

308
00:27:07.393 --> 00:27:09.962
And they are coming
to take statements

309
00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:13.800
so everyone needs to stay here.

310
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.836
- What about the ambulance?
- Yeah. ambulance too.

311
00:27:16.836 --> 00:27:19.371
We can't have the
police coming here.

312
00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:20.907
Huh. why not?

313
00:27:20.907 --> 00:27:24.610
Marshanda. she might be
running from something. I think.

314
00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.546
- For what?
- What is she looking for?

315
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:32.151
Look. why is she looking?

316
00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:33.853
I don't know. until
I figure that one out.

317
00:27:33.853 --> 00:27:36.455
let's maybe not throw her
under the bus. all right.

318
00:27:36.455 --> 00:27:37.656
The thing on the wrist.

319
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.429
this crest. what is it?

320
00:27:45.932 --> 00:27:48.500
That crest is
ancient and it's been

321
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.470
in that building upstairs long
before it was a restaurant.

322
00:27:54.073 --> 00:27:55.808
They've been trying
to buy me out

323
00:27:56.876 --> 00:27:58.477
and they'll try
anything to burn me.

324
00:27:59.578 --> 00:28:03.783
Look. I'm sorry.
but keep this quiet.

325
00:28:03.783 --> 00:28:06.285
they've put a bid
in for this place.

326
00:28:06.285 --> 00:28:08.855
It's three times what
the place is worth.

327
00:28:08.855 --> 00:28:11.257
Maybe she's involved with them.

328
00:28:11.257 --> 00:28:12.158
No. no.

329
00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:15.227
She's not with them.

330
00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:19.465
Then keep her out of sight.

331
00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:23.369
What makes you think this
is going well. I don't--

332
00:28:23.369 --> 00:28:25.371
No. no. no. absolutely.
We'll just. we'll start again.

333
00:28:25.371 --> 00:28:26.505
Me and Chloe.

334
00:28:26.505 --> 00:28:27.740
Get your mucky
hands off of me.

335
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.810
No. no. the police
said not to leave.

336
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:33.479
Help me out.

337
00:28:35.414 --> 00:28:36.315
Mia.

338
00:28:38.184 --> 00:28:39.085
help me out.

339
00:28:50.696 --> 00:28:52.631
- Hello. Matt.
- Mr. Walsh.

340
00:28:52.631 --> 00:28:54.166
fancy seeing you here.

341
00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:58.037
This is DC Cross. been a bit
of a disturbance in the area.

342
00:28:58.037 --> 00:29:00.873
I just wanted to check our
lovely neighbors were all right.

343
00:29:03.876 --> 00:29:05.044
Go. go. there.

344
00:29:05.044 --> 00:29:07.146
In here. go. in
here. stay. you stay.

345
00:29:07.146 --> 00:29:08.414
No. no. you gotta stay and hide.

346
00:29:08.414 --> 00:29:09.849
We need to keep
you out of sight.

347
00:29:29.235 --> 00:29:32.371
Well. it looks
like our suspect

348
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:35.607
committed similar
acts on your premises.

349
00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:39.511
- Yo. Skip. who is this guy?
- Theodore Walsh.

350
00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:41.313
He inherited the
restaurant from his father

351
00:29:41.313 --> 00:29:43.682
and also acquired his
lust for this place.

352
00:29:43.682 --> 00:29:46.853
Call me Ted.
actually no. Mr. Walsh.

353
00:29:46.853 --> 00:29:51.257
My associate believes
our suspect is here.

354
00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:54.526
my niece.

355
00:29:56.462 --> 00:29:57.830
Your niece?

356
00:29:59.365 --> 00:30:02.201
We are just concerned.

357
00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:11.911
Well. maybe we should just
wait for the police. eh.

358
00:30:11.911 --> 00:30:13.179
sort this all out.

359
00:30:14.947 --> 00:30:17.616
But we are the police anyway.

360
00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:20.987
You got any id?

361
00:30:22.454 --> 00:30:24.223
Isn't that how you
do things here?

362
00:30:25.257 --> 00:30:26.158
Come here.

363
00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:31.830
Look at my face.

364
00:30:33.199 --> 00:30:35.301
This is all the ID you need.

365
00:30:35.301 --> 00:30:37.169
Take a good long look.

366
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.305
There we go.

367
00:30:47.046 --> 00:30:48.547
So your niece?

368
00:30:48.547 --> 00:30:49.581
Yes.

369
00:30:50.917 --> 00:30:54.453
hospital gown. violent.
quite the character.

370
00:30:54.453 --> 00:30:56.956
a troubled young
woman. I have to say.

371
00:30:56.956 --> 00:30:58.124
We were in the
process of getting her

372
00:30:58.124 --> 00:31:01.160
some assistance.
psychiatric assistance.

373
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.495
She had an episode. ran away.

374
00:31:04.796 --> 00:31:06.032
millennials.

375
00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:11.803
Your niece.

376
00:31:15.574 --> 00:31:16.508
you're her uncle?

377
00:31:17.676 --> 00:31:19.478
- Yes.
- And this lot?

378
00:31:20.913 --> 00:31:22.348
They're your task force?

379
00:31:22.348 --> 00:31:23.515
Uncle.

380
00:31:23.515 --> 00:31:25.651
- We're also uncle.
- Also uncle.

381
00:31:28.654 --> 00:31:29.555
Big family.

382
00:31:33.659 --> 00:31:35.161
More police are on the way.

383
00:31:35.995 --> 00:31:36.963
Are they?

384
00:31:42.368 --> 00:31:44.103
We were just trying to leave.

385
00:31:45.304 --> 00:31:46.705
Hi. we have a
schedule to keep.

386
00:31:48.874 --> 00:31:51.843
Hey. don't touch me.

387
00:31:56.715 --> 00:31:58.417
Relax.

388
00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:00.819
Let's all have some drinks.
that's why we're here. right?

389
00:32:01.787 --> 00:32:03.289
All we need is the woman.

390
00:32:04.156 --> 00:32:05.057
Where is she?

391
00:32:11.497 --> 00:32:14.533
She was here. Mr. Walsh.

392
00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.736
I don't know where
she is currently.

393
00:32:21.173 --> 00:32:22.074
Whoops.

394
00:32:22.975 --> 00:32:24.343
I'll get those up.

395
00:32:24.343 --> 00:32:25.544
Let's try again.

396
00:32:58.477 --> 00:32:59.945
Well. look who it is.

397
00:32:59.945 --> 00:33:02.481
Come on. darling.

398
00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:15.627
Why were you hiding in there?

399
00:33:23.802 --> 00:33:24.703
Mia.

400
00:33:25.604 --> 00:33:28.040
these men are dangerous.

401
00:33:29.475 --> 00:33:30.442
No. stop.

402
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.412
See.

403
00:33:33.412 --> 00:33:35.947
Wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

404
00:33:42.654 --> 00:33:45.157
Mister. I'm not who
you're looking for.

405
00:33:45.157 --> 00:33:46.258
Mr. Walsh.

406
00:33:49.195 --> 00:33:50.229
Mr. Walsh.

407
00:33:50.229 --> 00:33:52.098
I think I might have seen them

408
00:33:52.098 --> 00:33:54.233
going into the toilets together.

409
00:33:57.002 --> 00:33:58.537
She might still be in there.

410
00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.011
Made a new friend today.

411
00:34:07.479 --> 00:34:08.380
Hmm?

412
00:34:10.015 --> 00:34:11.950
I wonder what you
both talked about.

413
00:34:45.984 --> 00:34:46.885
Mia.

414
00:35:10.342 --> 00:35:12.244
Told you she was
there. Boss. that's her.

415
00:35:12.244 --> 00:35:13.145
Oh yes.

416
00:35:21.487 --> 00:35:24.890
I want you all outta my bar.

417
00:35:36.034 --> 00:35:37.703
Eddie. the glass.

418
00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.448
Right now!

419
00:36:03.629 --> 00:36:07.032
Now. now.

420
00:36:08.867 --> 00:36:10.569
Do you wanna see
if this thing works?

421
00:36:10.569 --> 00:36:12.504
Or do you wanna get
the fuck outta here?

422
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:17.476
Get back. get back!

423
00:36:17.476 --> 00:36:19.010
Take both the girls.

424
00:37:09.094 --> 00:37:10.562
I've been shot.

425
00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:14.900
What is this shit?

426
00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:17.969
Sorry.

427
00:37:20.038 --> 00:37:20.939
Clear

428
00:37:21.907 --> 00:37:24.109
my browser history.

429
00:37:27.879 --> 00:37:29.415
C'est la vie.

430
00:37:29.415 --> 00:37:31.016
That's life.

431
00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:32.751
Sorry.

432
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.488
Bring her to me.

433
00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:39.725
no witnesses.

434
00:37:39.725 --> 00:37:41.627
kill them all.

435
00:38:40.952 --> 00:38:42.287
What is that?

436
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:45.223
That's where the Morgans
went centuries ago.

437
00:38:45.223 --> 00:38:46.124
you know that's gonna be.

438
00:38:46.124 --> 00:38:47.493
- A way out?
- Yes.

439
00:38:47.493 --> 00:38:49.828
Something's
better than nothing.

440
00:39:01.206 --> 00:39:02.941
Let's go.

441
00:39:09.815 --> 00:39:11.282
Let's play catch.

442
00:39:23.061 --> 00:39:24.430
Eddie!

443
00:39:26.798 --> 00:39:28.033
No. no. Eddie.

444
00:39:33.271 --> 00:39:35.474
No.

445
00:40:57.355 --> 00:40:58.890
It's going to be.

446
00:41:01.426 --> 00:41:03.094
It's going to be okay.
we'll get you help.

447
00:41:03.094 --> 00:41:05.864
We'll get everything
sorted. the help you need.

448
00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:10.001
There's a way out underground.

449
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:13.539
Oh no. I'm not
leaving you behind.

450
00:41:15.707 --> 00:41:19.410
The Orlop River. the Orlop.

451
00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.212
What do you mean
the Orlop River?

452
00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:25.383
Skip. no.

453
00:41:25.383 --> 00:41:26.451
The Orlop.

454
00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:05.991
Go see what's in there for me.

455
00:42:07.593 --> 00:42:08.994
No. thank you. Mr. Walsh.

456
00:42:09.995 --> 00:42:11.096
We should leave.

457
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.500
Okay.

458
00:42:21.106 --> 00:42:23.174
- Gang warfare.
- What do we do?

459
00:42:32.884 --> 00:42:34.085
There has to be a way out.

460
00:42:34.085 --> 00:42:35.721
Hey. you two. with
me now. come on.

461
00:42:36.622 --> 00:42:37.555
No.

462
00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:38.724
She works here. come on.

463
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.569
Guys. there's
another room back here.

464
00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:57.709
Come on. let's go.

465
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.245
Hurry. hurry. hurry.

466
00:43:04.883 --> 00:43:09.955
Marshanda. come on. let's go.

467
00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:12.257
Help me.

468
00:43:17.729 --> 00:43:18.630
Come on.

469
00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:26.104
Go!

470
00:43:27.372 --> 00:43:30.541
No. Benny. Benny.
come on. come on!

471
00:43:47.759 --> 00:43:49.394
This is your doing!

472
00:43:58.403 --> 00:44:01.072
The girl's in here
with me. Mr. Walsh.

473
00:44:01.072 --> 00:44:02.573
Why do they want her?

474
00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:04.175
Don't know.

475
00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:05.110
How long have you worked here

476
00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:06.377
and not had access to this room?

477
00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:08.747
I had no idea this was
here until a minute ago.

478
00:44:08.747 --> 00:44:12.250
Do you think these are
access points to fix the pipes?

479
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.384
Well. who cares?

480
00:44:44.149 --> 00:44:45.817
You shot me!

481
00:44:56.561 --> 00:44:58.229
I need a doctor!

482
00:45:02.567 --> 00:45:03.935
How many muskets?

483
00:45:03.935 --> 00:45:06.404
Muskets. god that
app needs updating.

484
00:45:06.404 --> 00:45:08.974
Yes. muskets. very bad.

485
00:45:11.843 --> 00:45:13.344
What do they want with her?

486
00:45:14.312 --> 00:45:16.014
There's nowhere to run.

487
00:45:16.014 --> 00:45:18.649
You should--

488
00:45:22.487 --> 00:45:24.522
- Orlop River.
- River?

489
00:45:26.124 --> 00:45:29.060
You think this pipe leads
to one of the sunken rivers?

490
00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.595
Orlop river . Skip said..

491
00:45:30.595 --> 00:45:32.998
You lot need to get your
priorities straight there.

492
00:45:32.998 --> 00:45:34.833
There is no Orlop River.

493
00:45:34.833 --> 00:45:37.803
Nearest sunken river's
the Tiburn or something.

494
00:45:39.537 --> 00:45:41.106
Might as well just give it up.

495
00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:44.075
Orlop.

496
00:45:44.075 --> 00:45:47.846
Orlop is the lowest part of
a ship of the rogue sea cats.

497
00:45:47.846 --> 00:45:50.581
- Skip said Orlop River. but.
- It could be a way out.

498
00:46:01.927 --> 00:46:06.998
Look. is there anything we
can do to keep your boss happy?

499
00:46:11.402 --> 00:46:14.005
Well. they're obviously
looking for what?

500
00:46:16.842 --> 00:46:19.477
Something Cat Morgan
brought down here

501
00:46:19.477 --> 00:46:21.179
hundreds of years ago.

502
00:46:21.179 --> 00:46:22.080
Red Cat Morgan?

503
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:28.653
Are you talking about
Red Cat's treasure?

504
00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:31.789
That's just a myth.

505
00:46:43.334 --> 00:46:45.136
Your phone. can
you translate this?

506
00:46:48.506 --> 00:46:50.608
Language not found.

507
00:46:50.608 --> 00:46:52.978
It's not a
language in the app.

508
00:46:52.978 --> 00:46:54.512
Maybe you can have
her say something

509
00:46:54.512 --> 00:46:56.081
and it'll translate that.

510
00:46:56.081 --> 00:46:57.148
Can you read this?

511
00:46:58.649 --> 00:46:59.550
Read it.

512
00:47:04.622 --> 00:47:09.227
To destination
advance. coast departure urgent.

513
00:47:09.227 --> 00:47:11.897
No. no. no. I think I get it.

514
00:47:11.897 --> 00:47:14.532
It's Red's motto written
in some coded language.

515
00:47:16.101 --> 00:47:17.435
Skip said follow the Orlop River

516
00:47:17.435 --> 00:47:19.804
and this pipes say
Orlop steel on it.

517
00:47:19.804 --> 00:47:22.407
I think Cat. Red Cat must
have left that painting

518
00:47:22.407 --> 00:47:25.010
for someone and Marshanda
knows something about it.

519
00:47:26.611 --> 00:47:28.513
I bet whatever they're
after is through this pipe

520
00:47:28.513 --> 00:47:30.748
and Skip realized it
when he saw the hatch.

521
00:47:32.083 --> 00:47:33.251
Let's try and find it.

522
00:47:34.419 --> 00:47:35.386
Let's try and find it. yeah.

523
00:47:35.386 --> 00:47:36.955
And we can give it to your boss.

524
00:47:36.955 --> 00:47:39.424
you can smooth things
over. buy some time.

525
00:47:39.424 --> 00:47:40.658
and we'll keep running.

526
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.428
You're safe.

527
00:47:43.428 --> 00:47:44.695
We are safe.

528
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.098
Right?

529
00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:09.820
Up that way. right?

530
00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:13.691
I really can't do this.

531
00:48:18.296 --> 00:48:19.197
Ah!

532
00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:21.732
Save yourselves.

533
00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:23.201
Stop showing off!

534
00:48:31.209 --> 00:48:32.110
Quick.

535
00:48:54.532 --> 00:48:57.835
Boss. the room's
empty. they've disappeared.

536
00:48:57.835 --> 00:49:00.871
All right. I need a.

537
00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:04.809
well. well. well.
what have we here?

538
00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:06.844
Now what is

539
00:49:06.844 --> 00:49:08.113
the deal with that room?

540
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.050
how would I know. I've
never been in there?

541
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:16.021
And besides. I'm way too hench
to fit through that shit.

542
00:49:16.021 --> 00:49:18.056
You saying I'm
not hench enough?

543
00:49:18.056 --> 00:49:20.091
It's a fucking hatch.
what do you want?

544
00:49:20.091 --> 00:49:23.561
Good point. what
we want is the girl

545
00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:25.163
and more specifically
something she has.

546
00:49:25.163 --> 00:49:28.066
a little wrist device. and
what she can find with it.

547
00:49:28.066 --> 00:49:30.501
But the chief concern is
where they could have gone

548
00:49:30.501 --> 00:49:32.037
because they're not in there.

549
00:49:33.538 --> 00:49:36.841
I think this one
may be able to work it out.

550
00:49:36.841 --> 00:49:37.775
Me?

551
00:49:37.775 --> 00:49:39.810
What makes you think that?

552
00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.179
Call it a hunch.

553
00:49:48.519 --> 00:49:49.487
It's not my hat.

554
00:50:01.299 --> 00:50:02.767
Come on.

555
00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:09.740
Come on. get on with it.

556
00:50:10.641 --> 00:50:12.310
Get on with what?

557
00:50:13.111 --> 00:50:14.212
Where'd they go?

558
00:50:17.682 --> 00:50:21.086
There's a secret door
in here or something.

559
00:50:22.987 --> 00:50:23.888
Find it.

560
00:50:44.409 --> 00:50:46.344
Keep moving.

561
00:50:46.344 --> 00:50:48.113
We're getting there.

562
00:50:48.113 --> 00:50:49.414
Getting where?

563
00:50:50.315 --> 00:50:53.518
All the way from the bad guys.

564
00:50:53.518 --> 00:50:54.652
Yeah. right.

565
00:50:56.821 --> 00:50:59.457
- Come on.
- Don't push me. stop.

566
00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:07.465
Go. go.

567
00:51:09.467 --> 00:51:11.436
No. no. no. no. no. no.

568
00:51:47.238 --> 00:51:48.105
Well. shit.

569
00:51:50.074 --> 00:51:51.376
He's done it.

570
00:51:51.376 --> 00:51:53.344
He's found a little escape room.

571
00:52:02.153 --> 00:52:05.423
Oh God. no. stop pushing me.

572
00:52:05.423 --> 00:52:06.324
I'm stuck!

573
00:52:08.526 --> 00:52:09.427
Stop!

574
00:52:27.578 --> 00:52:29.447
Don't. no. no. please.

575
00:52:29.447 --> 00:52:30.348
Hey.

576
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:34.885
What's going on.
why did we stop.

577
00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:35.820
and why are the light out?

578
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:36.854
Someone talk to me. please.

579
00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:37.755
No!

580
00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:49.667
Oh. I'm gonna die.

581
00:52:53.238 --> 00:52:54.038
Breathe.

582
00:53:00.311 --> 00:53:02.513
Oh shit. breathe. breathe.

583
00:53:20.465 --> 00:53:22.032
Here. take this.

584
00:53:26.237 --> 00:53:27.572
It's a penis.

585
00:53:35.913 --> 00:53:36.914
She's gone.

586
00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:42.253
The American girl's gone.

587
00:53:42.253 --> 00:53:43.153
Hello?

588
00:53:44.622 --> 00:53:46.190
Somebody's coming.

589
00:53:50.027 --> 00:53:51.596
Somebody's coming.

590
00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:56.934
You good?

591
00:53:58.569 --> 00:53:59.837
I found a way out.

592
00:53:59.837 --> 00:54:00.671
It's crazy cool.

593
00:54:03.808 --> 00:54:05.976
It's not mine. sorry.

594
00:54:06.811 --> 00:54:08.346
It doesn't mean anything.

595
00:54:22.827 --> 00:54:26.163
Which way?

596
00:54:26.163 --> 00:54:30.568
We're getting closer. they
definitely came this way.

597
00:55:02.433 --> 00:55:04.268
All this is under the bar?

598
00:55:04.268 --> 00:55:07.705
Under the bar and so far
back we are no longer in Soho.

599
00:55:07.705 --> 00:55:09.173
It is nice shit.

600
00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:12.777
Skips Dad knew
about this place.

601
00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.383
I heard voices. they're coming.

602
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.921
The way out's that way.

603
00:55:24.889 --> 00:55:26.424
Well let's move. yeah.

604
00:55:26.424 --> 00:55:29.427
If they catch us. we're dead.

605
00:55:29.427 --> 00:55:31.195
Someone's been
paying attention.

606
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:34.198
Follow the breeze.

607
00:55:41.606 --> 00:55:42.507
Hang on.

608
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:46.276
Your translation app.

609
00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.748
It's still looking.

610
00:55:50.748 --> 00:55:53.283
- During. let's move.
- We can't hang about.

611
00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:54.819
One second.

612
00:55:55.753 --> 00:55:57.688
I need to go this way.

613
00:55:57.688 --> 00:55:58.523
Oh. no. no. no. we
need to get out here.

614
00:55:58.523 --> 00:55:59.657
it's too dangerous.

615
00:56:01.025 --> 00:56:04.028
Danger.

616
00:56:08.899 --> 00:56:11.068
- What do we do?
- I'm sticking with her

617
00:56:11.068 --> 00:56:13.137
but if you wanna go. you can go.

618
00:56:14.004 --> 00:56:15.005
I'll stay with you guys.

619
00:56:15.005 --> 00:56:16.206
Seems safer.

620
00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:18.743
What are we doing
hanging about. come on.

621
00:56:18.743 --> 00:56:19.644
It's that way.

622
00:56:20.945 --> 00:56:23.380
You said follow the breeze.

623
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.115
The breeze is that way.

624
00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:28.886
You're following the
echo of the breeze.

625
00:56:28.886 --> 00:56:31.288
The echo of the breeze.
makes sense to me.

626
00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:49.940
Marshanda. slow down.

627
00:56:56.614 --> 00:56:57.515
Marshanda!

628
00:57:52.537 --> 00:57:55.039
Try again in Mandarin.

629
00:57:55.039 --> 00:57:58.509
My sister. my friend.

630
00:57:58.509 --> 00:58:00.578
My friend.

631
00:58:00.578 --> 00:58:03.548
- Oh God. she's found her.
- Found who?

632
00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:07.184
Red Cat Morgan.

633
00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:10.888
My friend.

634
00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:14.124
That
thing around her neck.

635
00:58:14.124 --> 00:58:16.627
that's what Walsh
has been looking for.

636
00:58:16.627 --> 00:58:20.731
Walsh's father was a respected
historian and archeologist

637
00:58:20.731 --> 00:58:24.334
specializing in
18th-century piracy.

638
00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:29.406
in particular Red Cat
Morgan and her vast riches.

639
00:58:30.207 --> 00:58:31.676
On one of his expeditions.

640
00:58:31.676 --> 00:58:34.579
he discovered three small
bundles of cloth all decorated

641
00:58:34.579 --> 00:58:39.416
with a distinct crest.
in one a pendant.

642
00:58:39.416 --> 00:58:41.952
in the other two. nothing.

643
00:58:43.287 --> 00:58:46.691
It led him to buy the
Dragon Princess restaurant

644
00:58:46.691 --> 00:58:49.359
thinking the crest was a
sign of where the treasure

645
00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:53.197
or. at very least. the other
two pendants were kept.

646
00:58:54.298 --> 00:58:55.733
That's why the
symbol on her wrist

647
00:58:55.733 --> 00:58:57.768
matches the one on Dragon
Princess restaurant.

648
00:58:59.503 --> 00:59:01.238
He was wrong.
it was a red herring

649
00:59:01.238 --> 00:59:02.707
and there was no treasure.

650
00:59:02.707 --> 00:59:05.342
There was no more pendants.
he got the wrong place.

651
00:59:07.978 --> 00:59:10.815
It was an obsession that
spread from father to son.

652
00:59:11.949 --> 00:59:15.119
All that spurred them on
was that single pendant.

653
00:59:15.119 --> 00:59:17.321
which they knew was
only one of three.

654
00:59:21.325 --> 00:59:24.194
Months ago. a geological
expedition stumbled

655
00:59:24.194 --> 00:59:25.830
across Marshanda's ship.

656
00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:28.265
Walsh used all his
underground connections

657
00:59:28.265 --> 00:59:32.603
to get Marshanda's body and
what she wore around her wrist.

658
00:59:32.603 --> 00:59:35.773
It was only then he learned
what his father never knew.

659
00:59:37.141 --> 00:59:40.044
The wrist device contains
a compass which locks in

660
00:59:40.044 --> 00:59:41.812
on each of the pendants.

661
00:59:41.812 --> 00:59:44.348
When all three are brought
together and inserted

662
00:59:44.348 --> 00:59:45.850
into the wrist device.

663
00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:49.086
the compass would guide the
wearer to the final treasure.

664
00:59:50.621 --> 00:59:53.924
Marshanda's pendant
guided her to Red Cat.

665
00:59:53.924 --> 00:59:56.426
Now it's only Walsh's piece
that needs to be added

666
00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:59.930
before he can finally
get what he wants.

667
01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:12.576
I'm your crew
now. you're safe.

668
01:00:13.377 --> 01:00:15.245
I'll take care of you.

669
01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.347
Sister.

670
01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:37.668
- You don't want to go right?
- Which way?

671
01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:49.279
No. no. that looks
like the wrong way.

672
01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:50.715
You said it was that way.

673
01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:57.988
You go. I fight.

674
01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.323
Good idea. she should fight.

675
01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:01.358
- Shut up.
- She's great at it.

676
01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:02.827
what'd you want from me?

677
01:01:02.827 --> 01:01:04.862
- What are those. tracks?
- Yeah.

678
01:01:04.862 --> 01:01:07.164
- Must've gone down there.
- Yeah. I see it.

679
01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.899
I can't leave her.

680
01:01:11.468 --> 01:01:13.437
Move. move.

681
01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:30.254
Get them out of here.

682
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:14.698
Stop them!

683
01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:50.100
Let's get you out. come on.

684
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.136
I can't go back.
they'll kill Eddie.

685
01:02:53.637 --> 01:02:56.206
- Run and get help.
- Marshanda.

686
01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:58.876
They need her alive. you'll
do better than the others.

687
01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:01.045
Get out of here. follow
the breeze. go. go.

688
01:03:01.045 --> 01:03:02.479
All right. all right.

689
01:03:44.788 --> 01:03:46.290
Look out!

690
01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:04.641
No!

691
01:04:05.642 --> 01:04:07.044
No!

692
01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:49.686
We've got
them all now boss.

693
01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:52.056
they're not going anywhere.

694
01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:55.225
Good. I'll go
get Mr. Walsh down here.

695
01:04:57.261 --> 01:04:58.828
Let's finish this.

696
01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:21.718
Look. I don't
want any trouble.

697
01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:30.961
You're not going
get away with this.

698
01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:35.799
Don't you
try to move. any of you.

699
01:05:43.207 --> 01:05:44.741
Whoa!

700
01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:45.642
Careful.

701
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:48.378
Sorry.

702
01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:50.114
What. it's empty?

703
01:05:51.148 --> 01:05:53.183
- I knew I'd find you.
- Shut up.

704
01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:55.452
I thought you were dead.

705
01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.720
I thought you were all dead.

706
01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.988
We tried to slip a
gun off one of them

707
01:05:57.988 --> 01:06:00.890
and then these two gave
'em the old Liam Neeson.

708
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:01.858
Which one of these is loaded?

709
01:06:01.858 --> 01:06:03.160
I don't know.

710
01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.394
Is she gonna be all right?

711
01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:05.295
Well. she's made of
pretty tough stuff.

712
01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:06.596
I have to go.

713
01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:08.198
We can't get
her through that pipe.

714
01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:09.633
not if she's out cold.

715
01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:10.834
Worse than that. there's
more on them waiting

716
01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:12.069
on the other side.

717
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:13.003
We have to go. we
need get out of here.

718
01:06:13.003 --> 01:06:14.071
we need to follow that breeze.

719
01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:15.372
Tough guy is up there.

720
01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:18.142
Yeah. well we have these.

721
01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:28.585
Got any gum?

722
01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:30.587
Left it in the car.

723
01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:55.412
It's going to be okay.
we're gonna get out.

724
01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:59.015
Hey. you guys. I
found it. a way out.

725
01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.618
South Bank. I can see Pizza
Express. it's this way.

726
01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:03.420
Oh. if you wouldn't mind leaving

727
01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.490
a positive Trip Advisor
review. I'd be very grateful.

728
01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:09.226
Perhaps best not to mention
the hostage situation

729
01:07:10.094 --> 01:07:11.628
or all of the dead people.

730
01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:13.697
Thank you.

731
01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.303
Get them out.
call the police now.

732
01:07:19.303 --> 01:07:21.638
- You're not coming.
- I need to help her.

733
01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:25.175
The passcode's one.
two. three. four.

734
01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:26.876
don't check my messages.

735
01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:38.188
What are you doing?

736
01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:40.924
I just thought we.

737
01:07:40.924 --> 01:07:42.058
I just thought we were
really good back there.

738
01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:44.261
- I didn't--
- No. not really.

739
01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:47.864
- No?.
- Don't ever do that again.

740
01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:51.635
Right. sorry. sorry.

741
01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:53.903
You're a strange man.

742
01:08:08.252 --> 01:08:11.355
Ah. not so fast. or
turner faces the soup.

743
01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:18.595
All clear.

744
01:08:21.165 --> 01:08:22.532
Wonderful.

745
01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:24.968
You're all here.

746
01:08:29.873 --> 01:08:33.177
- Where's Eddie?
- Resting Easy with the doc.

747
01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:37.447
helping restore your little
tavern to its former glories.

748
01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:40.750
There he is.

749
01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:46.022
Like playing with rocks. do you?

750
01:08:51.161 --> 01:08:52.128
Look at me.

751
01:08:57.301 --> 01:08:59.836
No. stop. stop. stop.

752
01:09:01.238 --> 01:09:02.806
Put your hands down.

753
01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:07.244
Put your hands down.

754
01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.380
Please.

755
01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:15.084
please. please don't
let your men hurt him.

756
01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:17.421
Please. please.
honestly. we'll help you.

757
01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:40.510
Bring me the wrist device.

758
01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:53.022
It still works.

759
01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:59.296
We found Red's piece and
of course Marshanda's.

760
01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:16.413
It's here.

761
01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:22.185
Bring our niece and the barmaid
to keep her well behaved.

762
01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.055
Keep the rest here as a
bit of extra collateral.

763
01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.525
If you behave. they'll live.

764
01:10:28.525 --> 01:10:29.859
If she behaves. you live.

765
01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:37.567
Yeah.

766
01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:11.901
Why?

767
01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:17.073
Because I can and he couldn't.

768
01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:19.108
Is that worth
murdering my friends?

769
01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:20.009
Needs must

770
01:11:21.678 --> 01:11:23.012
and I need her.

771
01:12:33.116 --> 01:12:36.853
Coordinates.

772
01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:41.825
leading to riches. my riches.

773
01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:47.764
Aren't you rich enough?

774
01:12:47.764 --> 01:12:50.734
No. I wanna be double rich.

775
01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.007
How do you like me now. Dad?

776
01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:03.880
With these scrolls in
this particular order. I.

777
01:13:08.485 --> 01:13:09.385
You fucker.

778
01:13:12.288 --> 01:13:14.257
Do you remember the
order they were in?

779
01:13:14.257 --> 01:13:16.593
No. I was keeping
an eye on them.

780
01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:20.329
Does anyone remember
the order they were in?

781
01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:22.265
Fuck!

782
01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:25.502
Years we've been
working on this.

783
01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:31.407
Does it say
what order they should be in?

784
01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:33.242
No. I can't read this shit.

785
01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.411
this is some dead pirate code.

786
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.064
Mia. catch.

787
01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:01.237
Red Cat's painting. the code.

788
01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:11.681
There's something on this.

789
01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:13.583
it will help me open that.

790
01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:15.051
What if it's a booby trap?

791
01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:18.688
Come on Mia. come on.

792
01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:23.827
Come on. come on. think.
think. think. think.

793
01:14:23.827 --> 01:14:25.762
Come on Mia. think.

794
01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:25.088
I got the codes.

795
01:15:33.329 --> 01:15:37.000
Hey. I don't suppose DeCoon's
holding a first hostage rule

796
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.636
would be a problem for you.

797
01:15:41.705 --> 01:15:43.573
You can't leave!

798
01:15:44.808 --> 01:15:46.643
I have money!

799
01:15:46.643 --> 01:15:47.543
Asshole.

800
01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:53.316
You can't leave me!

801
01:15:53.316 --> 01:15:54.718
Wait!

802
01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:56.786
No!

803
01:16:17.841 --> 01:16:21.010
Welcome to the Smuggler's
Tavern. so head to the toilets.

804
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:23.579
empty those bladders before
entering Benny's hatch.

805
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.882
and crawling through the
claustrophobic labyrinth

806
01:16:25.882 --> 01:16:27.884
of Sebastian's tunnels.

807
01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:32.956
Argh. welcome mateys to the
underground caves of Soho.

808
01:16:34.223 --> 01:16:35.158
Waterproofs are available
just through here.

809
01:16:35.158 --> 01:16:36.359
It is quite claustrophobic.

810
01:16:36.359 --> 01:16:38.662
so you have been
warned. no refunds.

811
01:16:38.662 --> 01:16:42.165
How much do pirates
pay for their earrings?

812
01:16:42.165 --> 01:16:45.301
A buck-an-ear.
come on this way.

813
01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:49.305
All right. we're off.

814
01:16:50.974 --> 01:16:51.875
Be careful.

815
01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:57.613
Don't fuck the
place up. Eddie.

816
01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:00.583
Ah. she's getting
really good at that.

817
01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:02.852
It's the most
pertinent sentence.

818
01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:04.620
Seriously though. be careful.

819
01:17:08.792 --> 01:17:11.127
- We need money.
- Very nice.

820
01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:13.096
And I've got pictures on
my phone and the cloud.

821
01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:14.630
So we've got a plan B.

822
01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:20.436
Nice.

823
01:17:20.436 --> 01:17:21.337
Hey. Mi.

824
01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:26.475
Thanks.

825
01:17:38.822 --> 01:17:42.959
You sure you don't
want a hand with that.
