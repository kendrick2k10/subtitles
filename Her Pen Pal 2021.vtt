[indistinct chatter]

6
00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.633
- How do you feel?

7
00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:04.100
- So happy.

8
00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:05.967
Thank you. Victoria. truly.

9
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.467
This day has been everything
I ever imagined and more.

10
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.600
It's perfect.

11
00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:10.934
- Ladies and gentlemen.

12
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.667
it's time
for the bouquet toss!

13
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.467
- I think that's me.
How do I look?

14
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.166
- Happy.
- [laughs]

15
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.166
- Can we have all the single
ladies and the bride

16
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.633
to the front
of the room. please?

17
00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:20.467
It's time to toss the bouquet.

18
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.500
- Mia. thanks for taking
over for me.

19
00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:24.100
- All right. so you have
everything covered. right?

20
00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:26.033
- Gotta go vacation in Paris.

21
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.100
- Not sure taking a week off
being a wedding planner

22
00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:31.100
to be my best friend's
wedding planner is a vacation.

23
00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.867
but it is an honor.
[laughs]

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.867
So Grayson's on my desk.
You've got everything else.

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.200
I've got roaming.
so keep in touch.

26
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.200
[cheers and applause]

27
00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:45.767
Okay!
So we have wedding heels.

28
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.767
wedding kitten heels.
wedding flats.

29
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.033
- Tell me again why I need

30
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.934
three pairs of heels
for a wedding.

31
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.033
- Okay. one.
because it's your wedding.

32
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:55.300
Two. because you'll be happy
you have them.

33
00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:58.767
and. three. because
you couldn't make up your mind.

34
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.200
- Sorry I'm so indecisive.

35
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:02.667
but if I'd have known
the wedding planning

36
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.500
was just an endless
decision-making tree.

37
00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:06.233
I probably would've eloped.

38
00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:09.000
- Tracy. honey. life is an
endless decision-making tree.

39
00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:10.266
- Great. thanks!

40
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.100
That's reassuring.

41
00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:15.033
How about a wine break?
- Ooh. yes. please.

42
00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:20.767
Thank you!

43
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.300
Cheers.
- Cheers.

44
00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:26.767
Okay. so I wanted
to talk to you.

45
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.166
- Oh. let me guess.

46
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.934
Is this about a certain
ex-boyfriend of mine

47
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.166
who. starting tomorrow.
I will be spending

48
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.033
a fun-filled week
of wedding activities with

49
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.400
as maid of honor and best man?

50
00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.333
Don't worry. Trace.
I'm not!

51
00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm actually kind of excited.

52
00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:42.000
- Excited?
- Mm.

53
00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:45.233
I mean. Cam and I. we haven't
talked in six months.

54
00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:48.266
but maybe we needed this time
to reflect

55
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.700
and reconsider before.
who knows?

56
00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:53.600
Reconnecting against
a romantic Parisian backdrop?

57
00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:55.233
- [laughs awkwardly]
Okay.

58
00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:58.700
So. awkward follow-up:

59
00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:01.934
Cameron has just told us
he's bringing a date.

60
00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:05.000
- A date?

61
00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:07.600
To your wedding?

62
00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:10.633
- Are you okay?

63
00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:12.633
- Of course!
[laughing]

64
00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:15.300
I'm--I'm fine.

65
00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.233
I--I will be.

66
00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:19.934
- Vic...

67
00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:23.333
- What matters is you
are getting married.

68
00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:26.033
and we are going to Paris!

69
00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.800
- Whoo!

70
00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:46.734
Would you look at this?
- This is it!

71
00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:50.100
- Babe. we're in Paris!
[laughs]

72
00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:55.000
- Wow!
Oh. it's so fancy!

73
00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:56.867
- Tracy. Mike?

74
00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:00.500
So. how was your flight?

75
00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:02.200
- Great. although my brain
still thinks

76
00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:04.066
it's the middle of the night.
[laughter]

77
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.300
- Then let's get you checked in

78
00:04:05.433 --> 00:04:06.900
so you can have
a petite sieste.

79
00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:08.600
Marion...
[speaking French]

80
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.233
And you must be Victoria Lewis?
- Yes.

81
00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:14.867
- We have
the welcome baskets ready.

82
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.333
I hope they are to your
very fastidious specifications.

83
00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:20.667
- Oh. well. the bow
should be like this.

84
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.033
- Ah.

85
00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:23.667
- It's all about
the details. right?

86
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.066
- It's all about
enjoying yourself.

87
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.133
so please enjoy.

88
00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:30.000
See the Eiffel. the Louvre.

89
00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:31.834
- Maybe.
Oh. I would love to show

90
00:04:31.967 --> 00:04:33.734
the bride and groom where
they'll be getting married.

91
00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:34.834
- Oh!
- But of course.

92
00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:37.400
Right this way!
Please follow me.

93
00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:38.734
Mesdames et monsieur.

94
00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:41.700
La Plaza du
Palais grand ballroom!

95
00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:43.467
- Gorgeous. isn't it?
- Oh. wow.

96
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.734
- Yes!
And it's very grand.

97
00:04:47.867 --> 00:04:50.367
- So I was thinking the band
over here by the windows

98
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.900
and the tables evenly spaced
along this wall.

99
00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:56.533
and of course the dance floor
in the middle.

100
00:04:56.667 --> 00:04:58.200
It's gonna be perfect!

101
00:04:58.333 --> 00:05:00.400
- It's amazing.

102
00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:04.233
- Ah. I believe more
of your party are just--

103
00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:05.533
- Hey!
- Hi!

104
00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:08.467
Baby bump!
Come here.

105
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.767
You look gorgeous!
- Hi!

106
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.934
- Isn't she glowing?

107
00:05:12.066 --> 00:05:14.200
- I'm not glowing.
I'm sweating.

108
00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:15.467
- How was your flight?
- Hi. guys.

109
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.734
- Yeah. we're good.
You know. Seth read me

110
00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:19.200
"What to Expect When You're
Expecting" the entire time.

111
00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:21.734
so it was--
- Educational.

112
00:05:21.867 --> 00:05:23.800
- Henri. this is
Seth and Nathalie.

113
00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:25.133
They're part of
our college crew

114
00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:28.000
along with Mike and Mike's
best man. Cameron.

115
00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:42.100
- Hey!
Are you okay?

116
00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:45.800
- That depends.
Is Jen Cameron's date?

117
00:05:45.934 --> 00:05:47.400
- Who's Jen?
- She's only his

118
00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:49.867
supermodel-esque lawyer prodigy
work wife.

119
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.900
now I guess his wedding wife?

120
00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:53.133
- Wedding date. Vic.

121
00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:54.633
- Cam!
- Good to see you.

122
00:05:54.767 --> 00:05:55.867
- How are you?
- All right.

123
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.934
- Welcome. welcome.
- Good to see you.

124
00:05:57.066 --> 00:05:59.133
- Everyone. this is Jen.
Jen. this is everyone.

125
00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:00.166
- Hi.
- Hey.

126
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.667
- Hi. everyone.

127
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.333
I'm glad you all have
one easy-to-remember name.

128
00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:05.500
- Right.
- She's also endlessly witty.

129
00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:06.600
- Hey. I'm Seth.

130
00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:08.367
This is my wife Nathalie.
- Hi.

131
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.200
- And this is Mike and Tracy.
the bride and the groom.

132
00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:11.200
- That's us!
- Hi.

133
00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:12.433
- Thank you for coming.

134
00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:13.700
- And then of course.
this is--

135
00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:15.033
- Oh. hi. Victoria.

136
00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:16.266
I don't know
if you remember me.

137
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.033
- Jen. yes. of course
I remember you!

138
00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:21.533
So great to see you again.

139
00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:25.600
- So. Jen. what do you do?

140
00:06:25.734 --> 00:06:27.333
- Oh. I'm a patent lawyer
like him.

141
00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:29.166
- Yeah. that's how we met.
through work.

142
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.033
- Wow. two lawyers.
- Can't imagine when you argue.

143
00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:33.834
[awkward laughter]

144
00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:36.033
- We never argue. so...

145
00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:38.367
[laughs softly]
Okay.

146
00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:43.033
- Let's check in.

147
00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:45.133
Bienvenue Ã  Paris!

148
00:06:45.266 --> 00:06:47.734
Let's--let's check in.

149
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.900
[elevator dings]

150
00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:02.900
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

151
00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:05.200
So what if we dated for
12 years and he ended things

152
00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:06.834
because he couldn't see
a future with me.

153
00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:09.066
and now he's dating
his perfect work wife?

154
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.333
I mean. I-I'm fine.

155
00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:12.233
I'm actually happy for them.
yeah.

156
00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:15.934
And now I'm 100% done
talking about it.

157
00:07:18.066 --> 00:07:19.233
No. really. I'm canceling

158
00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:20.667
your subscriptions
to my Cameron issues.

159
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.200
- Vic. it's okay to be upset.

160
00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:24.567
- Yeah. you were together
a long time.

161
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.200
- We were!

162
00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:28.567
And I thought we were
going to have a life together.

163
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.200
It seemed perfect.
Cam was my first love.

164
00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:35.700
- Um. I'm pretty sure Jacques
was your first love.

165
00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:37.400
- No. he wasn't.
We were teenagers.

166
00:07:37.533 --> 00:07:40.600
It was long-distance.
- Okay. right. wait a second.

167
00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:42.734
I-I have never even heard
you talk about this person.

168
00:07:42.867 --> 00:07:44.233
Who is Jacques?

169
00:07:44.367 --> 00:07:45.700
- Freshman year
of high school French.

170
00:07:45.834 --> 00:07:48.033
we all got assigned
a Parisian pen pal.

171
00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:51.734
and Victoria's was Jacques.
and they fell in love.

172
00:07:51.867 --> 00:07:54.700
wrote letters
throughout high school.

173
00:07:54.834 --> 00:07:56.834
- What. like. real letters
in the mail?

174
00:07:56.967 --> 00:07:58.734
- Yeah. like. international
postage rates and everything.

175
00:07:58.867 --> 00:08:00.567
- Wow.

176
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.166
- Jacques finally came to visit
the summer before college.

177
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.900
- He was so sweet.

178
00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:05.767
- And Victoria was supposed
to go to Paris the next year.

179
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.333
but they broke up before that.

180
00:08:07.467 --> 00:08:08.834
- Aw. why'd you break up?

181
00:08:08.967 --> 00:08:10.233
- We were kids.
- She met Cameron.

182
00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:12.600
- That is not what happened.

183
00:08:12.734 --> 00:08:15.433
- So have you
looked Jacques up?

184
00:08:15.567 --> 00:08:17.233
- Yeah. I Google
"Jacques in Paris."

185
00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:19.000
and now I'm combing through
the millions of search results.

186
00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:20.800
Hey. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa!

187
00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:23.000
What are you doing?
- What's Jacques' last name?

188
00:08:23.133 --> 00:08:25.066
- Why would I tell you that?
- Artis!

189
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.633
That's his last name.
and where's he live?

190
00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:30.500
- How would I possibly know?
- Come on.

191
00:08:31.734 --> 00:08:34.166
- He grew up in Taverny.
a small town outside of Paris.

192
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.767
You'll never find him.
- Found him.

193
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.266
Hmm. he's a contractor.
Call him.

194
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.400
- No.

195
00:08:40.533 --> 00:08:42.633
- It's already ringing.

196
00:08:43.734 --> 00:08:46.767
[cell phone ringing]

197
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.500
[saw buzzing]

198
00:08:56.133 --> 00:08:57.000
- [speaking French]

199
00:08:57.133 --> 00:08:58.266
- I got his voicemail.

200
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.066
- Leave a message.
- And say what?

201
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.734
"Hi. this is Victoria.
your long-lost pen pal.

202
00:09:02.867 --> 00:09:04.734
Surprise!"
No. I'm hanging up.

203
00:09:04.867 --> 00:09:07.467
- No--oh. hi. this is Victoria.
your long-lost pen pal.

204
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.967
Um. I'm in Paris.
Surprise!

205
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.700
And I am staying
at the Plaza du Palais.

206
00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:13.800
so we should reconnect.
Okay. thanks. okay. bye-bye.

207
00:09:13.934 --> 00:09:16.867
- What are you doing?
- Oh. hmm. whoops.

208
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.867
- Let's hope he never
checks his voicemails.

209
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.533
- Welcome.

210
00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:22.233
- You're lucky you're pregnant.

211
00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:24.633
- [laughs]

212
00:09:24.767 --> 00:09:27.000
- [giggles]

213
00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.700
- She's gonna thank me later.
- Yeah.

214
00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:30.600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

215
00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:34.900
- Bonjour. Jacques.
- Alex.

216
00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:36.333
- I've been trying to call.

217
00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:37.967
- Je suis dÃ©solÃ©.

218
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.533
I forget to check
my voicemails.

219
00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:41.233
- Ah. it's okay.

220
00:09:41.367 --> 00:09:43.367
From your friends at
the Newton-Abbott Hotel Group.

221
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.033
- Merci.

222
00:09:45.166 --> 00:09:47.500
I assume this comes with
no strings or pressure to sell.

223
00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:49.133
- Oh. no. no. no.
of course not.

224
00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:50.800
This is simply
our way of saying.

225
00:09:50.934 --> 00:09:52.567
"We know what this chateau
means to you.

226
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.000
"and we wanna make sure
you know

227
00:09:54.133 --> 00:09:56.200
what it would mean to us
if you were to sell."

228
00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:58.900
We wanna make sure we have
a property within this area

229
00:09:59.033 --> 00:10:01.300
by next spring or summer.

230
00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:03.033
and we're looking to start

231
00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:04.800
renovations as soon
as possible.

232
00:10:04.934 --> 00:10:07.200
- Okay. so both
take my time and...

233
00:10:07.333 --> 00:10:09.967
- Have an answer for us
within a week.

234
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.533
- Salut.
- Bye.

235
00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:21.633
- Hi. this is Victoria.
your long-lost pen pal.

236
00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:24.200
Um. I'm in Paris.
Surprise!

237
00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:26.033
And I am staying
at the Plaza du Palais.

238
00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:28.000
so we should reconnect.

239
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.834
- Trace!

240
00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.967
- Hi.
- Oh. sorry. were you napping?

241
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.200
It's time
for the champagne tasting.

242
00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:38.433
We have to pick a bottle
for the reception.

243
00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:42.300
- Ugh. you think you could just
pick for me and Mike?

244
00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:45.667
Sorry. jet lag struggle
is real.

245
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.967
- Of course.
My pleasure.

246
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.867
- Thank you. bye-bye.
- Love you.

247
00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:53.367
[elevator dings]

248
00:10:59.467 --> 00:11:01.233
- Hold the door!

249
00:11:02.734 --> 00:11:04.834
- Come on. come on. come on!

250
00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:08.867
- Thank you.
[elevator dings]

251
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.934
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:11:16.266 --> 00:11:19.033
- Hmm.
So. how are you?

253
00:11:19.166 --> 00:11:22.433
- Great. and you?
- Good. busy.

254
00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:25.066
Quite the best man
to-do list you made for me.

255
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.734
- Yeah. well.
destination wedding.

256
00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:30.567
- Well.
a Victoria Lewis wedding.

257
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.700
Oh. I'm sure it'll be flawless
like always.

258
00:11:33.834 --> 00:11:35.567
but I am surprised
that Mike and Tracy

259
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.433
wanted this whole
big Parisian wedding thing.

260
00:11:38.567 --> 00:11:39.633
Doesn't really seem like them.

261
00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:42.200
- Well. Cameron.
while I appreciate

262
00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:43.900
you sowing last-minute seeds
of doubt

263
00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:46.266
into an event I've spent
the last year planning.

264
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.633
I also think...

265
00:11:48.767 --> 00:11:51.100
"Paris is always a good idea."

266
00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:56.233
It's Audrey Hepburn
in "Sabrina."

267
00:11:56.367 --> 00:11:58.100
- Never saw it.
- Yeah. you did.

268
00:11:58.233 --> 00:11:59.233
We watched it together--
oh. no. that's right.

269
00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:00.800
You fell asleep.

270
00:12:00.934 --> 00:12:03.333
- Vic. you know old movies
are not my thing.

271
00:12:03.467 --> 00:12:04.800
- Yeah.

272
00:12:04.934 --> 00:12:07.934
I know new things
are much more your preference.

273
00:12:08.066 --> 00:12:10.000
[elevator dings]

274
00:12:11.233 --> 00:12:14.433
- So. enjoy the city.
- I will.

275
00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.633
"Not every girl's lucky enough
to go to Paris."

276
00:12:17.767 --> 00:12:20.100
Still "Sabrina."

277
00:12:20.233 --> 00:12:23.033
- And I've still never seen it.

278
00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:25.233
[faint indistinct chatter]

279
00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:29.800
- [speaking French]

280
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.700
- Monsieur. can I help you?

281
00:12:32.834 --> 00:12:34.233
- [speaking French]

282
00:12:35.967 --> 00:12:38.433
- [speaking French]

283
00:12:38.567 --> 00:12:40.333
- [speaking French]

284
00:12:54.133 --> 00:12:55.467
- Oh. hi.

285
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.000
Before we start.
I just wanna say I'm looking

286
00:12:57.133 --> 00:12:59.867
for the perfect bottle
of champagne for this wedding.

287
00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:06.834
- Well. maybe I can help.
This is a demi-sec.

288
00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:08.700
It's dry.
It's crisp.

289
00:13:08.834 --> 00:13:10.700
It's fruity.
It's aged three years.

290
00:13:10.834 --> 00:13:13.900
- Mm. maybe something
a little older?

291
00:13:14.033 --> 00:13:17.200
- You know. not everything
gets better with age.

292
00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:18.934
And. you know. maybe
you should think less about

293
00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:23.033
the champagne's qualifications
and more about the feelings.

294
00:13:23.166 --> 00:13:26.367
more about the feelings
it gives you.

295
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.900
- It's supposed to
give you a feeling?

296
00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:30.500
- Yeah. of course.
that first sip feeling

297
00:13:30.633 --> 00:13:32.600
that all is well in the world.

298
00:13:32.734 --> 00:13:35.333
- It's a lot to ask
from a bubbly.

299
00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:38.700
- Well. you know. my father
used to say that champagne

300
00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:43.700
is to the French what duct tape
is to the Americans.

301
00:13:43.834 --> 00:13:47.166
It fixes everything.
- "It fixes everything."

302
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.734
Jacques?
- Victoria.

303
00:13:48.867 --> 00:13:50.066
- I'm so sorry!

304
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.166
I-I didn't know it was you.
Oh!

305
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.700
- Big surprise getting
your message.

306
00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:55.667
- Yeah. me too.

307
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.767
Um. please sit.
- Merci.

308
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.133
So. you've finally
made it to Paris.

309
00:14:03.266 --> 00:14:07.600
- Well. actually. I've been
here before a number of times.

310
00:14:07.734 --> 00:14:10.667
but just for work. never play.
- Yeah.

311
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.734
- But I've never been
to any of the sights

312
00:14:12.867 --> 00:14:14.467
on our "Tour de France."

313
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.567
That's what you used to call
showing me Paris when--

314
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.633
- No. no. I remember.

315
00:14:19.767 --> 00:14:21.233
Actually. there's a place

316
00:14:21.367 --> 00:14:23.767
not far from here
that was on the tour.

317
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.000
- Oh?
Um...

318
00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:27.400
- Ah. but you're busy.
of course.

319
00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.500
- No. no. no. I can go.
I mean--

320
00:14:29.633 --> 00:14:32.000
I could use some food
to go with the bubbly.

321
00:14:32.133 --> 00:14:34.467
- Perfect.
- Parfait.

322
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.667
- That's a little dessert.

323
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.967
Allez?

324
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.767
[faint indistinct chatter]

325
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.667
Merci beaucoup.

326
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.166
- Holy crepe!
This is amazing.

327
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.300
[laughs]
How's your croque monsieur?

328
00:14:57.433 --> 00:14:58.567
- Parfait.

329
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.367
It's the national dish
of the French.

330
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.700
- Got to love a country
where the national dish

331
00:15:02.834 --> 00:15:04.667
is a fried ham sandwich.

332
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.834
and a fried ham sandwich
with an egg is its wife.

333
00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:09.900
- Croque monsieur.
croque madame.

334
00:15:10.033 --> 00:15:11.567
That's funny.

335
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.700
Allez.
- Mm.

336
00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:19.200
- Still living in Chicago?

337
00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:21.800
- My parents are.
but I'm in Los Angeles now.

338
00:15:21.934 --> 00:15:24.333
- Oh. okay.
and what do you do there?

339
00:15:24.467 --> 00:15:26.166
- I own an event
planning company.

340
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.567
- Ah.

341
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.166
- It's a good mix
of me loving parties

342
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.066
and being very detail-oriented.
[both laugh]

343
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.400
What about you?

344
00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:36.900
Did you travel the world

345
00:15:37.033 --> 00:15:38.300
like you've always said
you would?

346
00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:41.667
- Uh. yeah. yeah.
but then my father got sick.

347
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.300
so I had to return
to the chateau to help him.

348
00:15:44.433 --> 00:15:46.633
He passed three years ago.
actually.

349
00:15:46.767 --> 00:15:48.734
- Oh. I'm so sorry.
- No. no. it's okay.

350
00:15:48.867 --> 00:15:51.066
and so now I look after
the upkeep of the chateau.

351
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.500
I run a contracting business.

352
00:15:53.633 --> 00:15:55.233
You know. we fix up old houses.

353
00:15:55.367 --> 00:15:57.667
It--it's good work.

354
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.700
It allows me
a flexible schedule.

355
00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.900
- So you can take time off

356
00:16:02.033 --> 00:16:04.567
to stroll aimlessly
with an old pen pal?

357
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.133
[chuckles softly]

358
00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:11.100
- With an old pen pal?

359
00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:14.900
And. you know. a stroll.
it's not so aimless.

360
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.867
- [gasps]

361
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.633
It's just so
incredibly romantic.

362
00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:27.467
[both laugh]

363
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.633
- Well. you should--

364
00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:33.900
you should come back here
one day with your fiancÃ©.

365
00:16:34.033 --> 00:16:37.133
- Well. to do that. first
I'd have to be dating someone.

366
00:16:37.266 --> 00:16:40.700
- I thought--I thought that
you were getting married.

367
00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:44.433
- What?
Oh. the champagne!

368
00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:46.233
No. no. no. no.
Um...

369
00:16:46.367 --> 00:16:49.100
That's--that's my best friend
Tracy. remember?

370
00:16:49.233 --> 00:16:51.033
She's getting married.

371
00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:54.700
- Oh.
Okay. okay.

372
00:16:54.834 --> 00:16:57.567
So you're--
you're not seeing anybody?

373
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.767
- Well. I was for many years.

374
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.633
but he broke up with me
six months ago.

375
00:17:02.767 --> 00:17:06.834
and now he's at this wedding
with someone else.

376
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.333
Yeah. as you say
in French. "Oof."

377
00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:14.000
[both laugh]

378
00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:15.700
What about you?
You seeing anyone?

379
00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:19.700
- Me?
No. no. no.

380
00:17:19.834 --> 00:17:23.633
Well. I see you.

381
00:17:26.133 --> 00:17:27.800
- [laughs]
Okay.

382
00:17:27.934 --> 00:17:30.667
Well. I should get back
to the hotel.

383
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.600
- Okay.
I'll walk you.

384
00:17:32.734 --> 00:17:34.166
- Okay.

385
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.633
Thank you
for a lovely afternoon.

386
00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.500
I know it's been 13 years

387
00:17:41.633 --> 00:17:43.500
and we didn't end
on the best of terms. but--

388
00:17:43.633 --> 00:17:45.667
- Jacques?
Is that Jacques?

389
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.300
- Uh. you remember
my best friend. Tracy?

390
00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:50.200
- Tracy. of course.
- And this is her fiancÃ©. Mike.

391
00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:51.433
- Mike. enchantÃ©.

392
00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:53.100
and felicitations
on your wedding.

393
00:17:53.233 --> 00:17:54.433
What a happy occasion.

394
00:17:54.567 --> 00:17:57.166
- Speaking of. I should go.
- Yes. of course.

395
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.667
Well. it was
lovely reconnecting.

396
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.166
and if you have time.

397
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.333
I'd love to take you
on our Tour de France.

398
00:18:02.467 --> 00:18:05.233
- I'd like that. but I'm so
slammed with the wedding prep.

399
00:18:05.367 --> 00:18:07.000
- Well. then maybe Jacques
could join us

400
00:18:07.133 --> 00:18:08.667
for a wedding activity.

401
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.100
There's a welcome
dinner tonight.

402
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.033
- No. I couldn't impose.
- No. no. no imposition.

403
00:18:16.166 --> 00:18:18.867
You're an old friend.

404
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.166
- And Victoria has a plus-one
she's not using.

405
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.333
- Hmm!

406
00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:24.367
- I do.
[laughs]

407
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.767
Um. welcome dinner here.
8:00 p.m.?

408
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.567
- Yes.
Yes. 8:00 p.m.

409
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.066
A bientÃ´t.

410
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.900
- Okay. bye.
[laughs]

411
00:18:35.033 --> 00:18:38.166
- Wow. Jacques grew up.

412
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.333
- Stop.
- Hon-hon-hon.

413
00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:42.967
- Don't.

414
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.633
[indistinct chatter]

415
00:18:50.533 --> 00:18:53.033
Thank you so much.

416
00:18:53.166 --> 00:18:55.467
One. two. three. four.

417
00:18:57.467 --> 00:18:59.433
Trace. I need to talk to you.
It's really. really important.

418
00:18:59.567 --> 00:19:01.333
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

419
00:19:01.467 --> 00:19:03.166
- Hey. babe.
- Absolutely.

420
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.500
- Hey. guys.

421
00:19:04.633 --> 00:19:06.000
- Hey. there she is.

422
00:19:06.133 --> 00:19:08.333
- Oh. you gotta try the salmon.
It is superb.

423
00:19:08.467 --> 00:19:09.900
- Really?
- Ooh. salmon.

424
00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:11.467
- Is it raw or cooked
because I'm not sure ...

425
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.834
- Oh. no. Seth. please don't.
It's fine.

426
00:19:12.967 --> 00:19:14.500
- I don't know
if you can have raw.

427
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.567
- God. you look beautiful.

428
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.567
- Thank you.
You look very handsome.

429
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.100
- I still can't believe
it's you.

430
00:19:35.233 --> 00:19:37.367
- I know the feeling.

431
00:19:39.066 --> 00:19:41.433
- Should I get us a drink?
- Sure.

432
00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:45.667
- Oh. no.

433
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.100
- The ex-boyfriend?
- Mm-hmm. that's him.

434
00:19:50.233 --> 00:19:53.100
- Quite the elaborate affair.

435
00:19:53.233 --> 00:19:55.100
Hi. I'm Cameron.

436
00:19:55.233 --> 00:19:57.800
- Bonsoir.
I'm Jacques.

437
00:19:57.934 --> 00:20:02.066
- Jacques?
As in pen pal Jacques?

438
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.600
- As in Jacques.

439
00:20:04.734 --> 00:20:08.066
my old friend Jacques.

440
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.066
- And your new plus-one. no?

441
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.800
- Really?
Um. uh...

442
00:20:12.934 --> 00:20:14.800
Plus-one. I mean.
for the entire week. or...

443
00:20:14.934 --> 00:20:18.100
- Well. no--
- Yeah. for the whole week.

444
00:20:18.233 --> 00:20:21.300
So we'll be getting
to know each other.

445
00:20:21.433 --> 00:20:24.433
Shall we get champagne?
I hear it's really well-chosen.

446
00:20:24.567 --> 00:20:26.467
- Yes. I would like that.

447
00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:29.934
- Salut.

448
00:20:30.066 --> 00:20:32.467
- [clears throat]

449
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.834
- I'm sorry if that seemed
presumptuous.

450
00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:38.667
I just felt that you could use
some moral support.

451
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.100
- I-I could.
I can. and thank you.

452
00:20:43.233 --> 00:20:45.967
But the whole week?
Aren't you busy?

453
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.233
- I'm French. so I'm never
too busy for a party.

454
00:20:49.367 --> 00:20:53.633
Plus. we have to finish
our Tour de France.

455
00:20:53.767 --> 00:20:56.000
- Well. I have
a little break tomorrow.

456
00:20:56.133 --> 00:20:58.400
- Perfect.

457
00:20:58.533 --> 00:21:00.500
- Thank you.

458
00:21:00.633 --> 00:21:03.700
Well. to old pen pals.

459
00:21:03.834 --> 00:21:07.500
- And to new plus-ones.

460
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.200
- Okay. wait. so is Jacques
now your date?

461
00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:28.633
- No. Jacques is my plus-one.
- Is there a difference?

462
00:21:28.767 --> 00:21:31.033
- Yes!
He's just an old friend.

463
00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:32.333
- Does Cameron know that?

464
00:21:32.467 --> 00:21:34.266
- Oh. who cares?

465
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.500
- How's it going in there?

466
00:21:38.333 --> 00:21:41.700
Oh!
You look beautiful!

467
00:21:41.834 --> 00:21:44.300
- Gorgeous!

468
00:21:44.433 --> 00:21:46.533
- Yeah. whoa...

469
00:21:46.667 --> 00:21:49.667
Yeah. but how am I
supposed to do the "YMCA"?

470
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.467
[soft laughter]

471
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.834
Maybe I should find
a different dress.

472
00:21:53.967 --> 00:21:55.500
- Oh. I thought
you loved this dress.

473
00:21:55.633 --> 00:21:56.934
- I did.
- Did?

474
00:21:57.066 --> 00:21:59.033
- Do!
I do love this dress.

475
00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:01.100
Sorry. Vic.
You know how I can be.

476
00:22:01.233 --> 00:22:02.367
- Well. you know.
it is your wedding.

477
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.934
I want you to be happy.
- I am happy.

478
00:22:05.066 --> 00:22:07.967
I just hope
I made the right choice.

479
00:22:09.633 --> 00:22:11.433
- Well. you know.
just a little alteration.

480
00:22:11.567 --> 00:22:13.333
and you'll be throwing
your hands in the air

481
00:22:13.467 --> 00:22:14.834
like you just don't care.

482
00:22:14.967 --> 00:22:16.333
- Whoo!

483
00:22:16.467 --> 00:22:18.166
- Plus. this dress is perfect
for the venue.

484
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.200
- It is really pretty.

485
00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:25.066
Oh. wow. look at that dress!

486
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.333
It's so elegant and simple.

487
00:22:29.467 --> 00:22:31.033
- Trace?

488
00:22:31.166 --> 00:22:34.934
- No. I promise
I'm not changing my mind.

489
00:22:36.367 --> 00:22:37.700
- Cake is booked.

490
00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:39.500
Cooking class
wedding activity confirmed.

491
00:22:39.633 --> 00:22:41.767
We. my friends.
are on schedule.

492
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.767
- Vic. are you gonna be
on your phone the entire trip?

493
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.400
- Do you want Tracy's
wedding planned?

494
00:22:46.533 --> 00:22:48.266
I just wanna congratulate Mia.

495
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.033
Do you remember I promoted my
assistant Mia to event planner?

496
00:22:51.166 --> 00:22:53.367
- Yeah. so you could work less
and delegate more?

497
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.066
- Oh. I forgot about that.
but yes.

498
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.533
Anyway. she pitched her
first wedding.

499
00:22:58.667 --> 00:23:00.333
and she got off
to a rocky start.

500
00:23:00.467 --> 00:23:02.166
but she's really
pulling it together.

501
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.166
She's got impeccable taste
but equal part self-doubt.

502
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.667
- Mm. sounds like you
when you first started.

503
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.567
"The sky is falling!"

504
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.767
- Remember. Vic?

505
00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.400
Every little thing
that went wrong.

506
00:23:13.533 --> 00:23:16.266
you'd be calling us like.
"The sky is falling!"

507
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.467
- I did not do that.
- You did!

508
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.834
- Okay. maybe a little.
- Yeah.

509
00:23:20.967 --> 00:23:24.133
- Oh. she's kicking.
- [gasps]

510
00:23:24.266 --> 00:23:26.800
- Oh. I can't believe
you're gonna be a mama.

511
00:23:26.934 --> 00:23:29.467
- I know--you know.
I can't believe it either.

512
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.166
Seems like baby life crept
up on us real quick.

513
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.500
Oh. and this trip
is mine and Seth's

514
00:23:33.633 --> 00:23:34.800
last hurrah as just a couple.

515
00:23:34.934 --> 00:23:37.433
so bring on all the romance
and all the fun.

516
00:23:37.567 --> 00:23:38.800
- Yeah.
- Yes!

517
00:23:38.934 --> 00:23:40.767
[laughter]

518
00:23:42.033 --> 00:23:42.900
- Hey!
- That'd be good.

519
00:23:43.033 --> 00:23:44.734
- Hey. hey. hey!
- Hey!

520
00:23:44.867 --> 00:23:47.233
- Hey!
- Excuse us.

521
00:23:47.367 --> 00:23:49.400
- How are you?
- So how are you feeling?

522
00:23:49.533 --> 00:23:51.166
- I'm great.
- Yeah?

523
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.166
- Yeah. I thought we could
relive our honeymoon in Paris.

524
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.734
- Okay. all right.

525
00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:56.300
- Yeah. so dinner at a bistro.
- Yeah.

526
00:23:56.433 --> 00:23:57.633
- Dancing in the Marais.

527
00:23:57.767 --> 00:23:59.333
and then to the Eiffel Tower
all lit up?

528
00:23:59.467 --> 00:24:02.233
- We're going on a walking
architecture tour of Versailles

529
00:24:02.367 --> 00:24:03.867
if you wanna join.

530
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.066
- No.
- Okay.

531
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.633
- We would love to.
but we're meeting our aunts.

532
00:24:08.767 --> 00:24:10.367
- Aunts.
Two of them.

533
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.734
- Let's go.
- Aunts?

534
00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:13.533
Vic?
- Hmm?

535
00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:15.533
- Walking tour?

536
00:24:15.667 --> 00:24:19.400
- Oh. thank you. but Jacques
is taking me sightseeing. so...

537
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.100
- Salut.

538
00:24:31.166 --> 00:24:33.533
- Hi.
- [laughs softly]

539
00:24:33.667 --> 00:24:34.734
- You're late.

540
00:24:34.867 --> 00:24:36.066
- No. I'm French.

541
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.700
- Oh. and that's an excuse?

542
00:24:37.834 --> 00:24:40.000
- Well. the French
do everything fashionably.

543
00:24:40.133 --> 00:24:43.633
especially being late.
but you're in a rush somewhere?

544
00:24:43.767 --> 00:24:46.800
- No. but I do have a schedule.
- Maybe you shouldn't.

545
00:24:46.934 --> 00:24:49.734
Instead. take a break.
Be a flaneur.

546
00:24:49.867 --> 00:24:51.734
You know this. flaneur?
It's a French thing.

547
00:24:51.867 --> 00:24:55.800
It means somebody who strolls
just to experience.

548
00:24:55.934 --> 00:24:58.467
who wanders with no purpose.

549
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.934
- That sounds kind
of terrifying.

550
00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:03.033
- Well. you used to love
to wander. remember?

551
00:25:03.166 --> 00:25:06.400
When I came to visit. we spent
whole days just getting lost.

552
00:25:06.533 --> 00:25:08.800
- Yeah. but you grow up.

553
00:25:08.934 --> 00:25:11.100
You get more goal-oriented.

554
00:25:11.233 --> 00:25:13.967
- Okay. well. for our next goal
on the Tour de France.

555
00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.800
I'm gonna take you
to my favorite patisserie.

556
00:25:16.934 --> 00:25:18.266
- Oh. well. if you'd led
with patisserie.

557
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.100
I would've overlooked lateness.

558
00:25:21.233 --> 00:25:23.300
- [laughs]

559
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.967
Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

560
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.266
- [speaking French]
- Yes.

561
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.834
- [speaking French]

562
00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:56.100
- This is the best croissant

563
00:25:56.233 --> 00:25:58.900
I've ever had
in my entire life.

564
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.500
Being here. I'm remembering
my teenage dreams

565
00:26:23.633 --> 00:26:25.767
for my summer in Paris:

566
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.867
sunny days in Montmartre.
reading poetry.

567
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.767
learning to paint.
leisurely picnics in the park.

568
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.967
- Yes. being a flaneur.

569
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.300
- Teenagers are good
at flaneur-ing.

570
00:26:37.433 --> 00:26:40.367
- Well. some of us
never lose the skill.

571
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.967
- Mm. I wish I hadn't.

572
00:26:44.734 --> 00:26:47.500
Life is just very busy now.

573
00:26:47.633 --> 00:26:50.033
My business grew quickly.
which I'm so grateful for.

574
00:26:50.166 --> 00:26:53.667
but it's fast-paced. you know?

575
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.100
Weddings are an industry.

576
00:26:56.233 --> 00:26:58.200
- Oh. so here naive me thought

577
00:26:58.333 --> 00:27:01.567
they were a celebration
of love and community.

578
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.000
- Oh. no. no.
purely just the money.

579
00:27:03.133 --> 00:27:04.734
[both laugh]

580
00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:06.900
Actually. that's why
I got into event planning.

581
00:27:07.033 --> 00:27:08.934
I love the idea
of bringing community

582
00:27:09.066 --> 00:27:10.567
together in celebration.

583
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.266
- Mm.
- And it turns out the romantic

584
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.233
in me nailed the wedding part.

585
00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:18.433
so now I'm known
for these big lavish affairs.

586
00:27:18.567 --> 00:27:21.734
- But you enjoy it. no?

587
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.700
- I do.

588
00:27:26.834 --> 00:27:28.900
Uh...

589
00:27:29.033 --> 00:27:32.233
But if I'm honest.

590
00:27:32.367 --> 00:27:34.400
some of the excitement
has worn off.

591
00:27:34.533 --> 00:27:36.300
- What happened?

592
00:27:37.533 --> 00:27:39.433
- I don't know.

593
00:27:39.567 --> 00:27:41.600
- Hmm.
Ah.

594
00:27:41.734 --> 00:27:46.066
Now. this is my favorite part
in the whole of Montmartre.

595
00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:50.000
Le mur des je t'aime.

596
00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:52.500
- The wall of "I love you"?
- Mm-hmm.

597
00:27:52.633 --> 00:27:56.734
Two artists created this wall
as a lasting monument to love.

598
00:27:56.867 --> 00:28:02.767
They've written "I love you"
311 times in 250 languages.

599
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.767
- What are the red
splashes for?

600
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.600
- Well. they symbolize
the pieces of a broken heart.

601
00:28:08.734 --> 00:28:11.467
- [laughs softly]
Why have a broken heart here?

602
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.900
- Maybe because to love fully.

603
00:28:15.033 --> 00:28:18.433
you--you have to embrace
a broken heart.

604
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.567
- It's beautiful.

605
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.867
- Mm.
I think so.

606
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.800
- Ah. Victoria. good.
I was about to call you.

607
00:28:44.934 --> 00:28:46.266
We have a problem.

608
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.734
We just discovered
that due to water damage.

609
00:28:48.867 --> 00:28:50.767
sections of the ballroom
ceiling are crumbling.

610
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.300
- And this is just
a friendly heads-up

611
00:28:53.433 --> 00:28:55.567
that it will have no effect
on Tracy and Mike's wedding?

612
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.100
- We are starting
repairs immediately.

613
00:28:57.233 --> 00:29:00.166
but the ballroom won't be ready
for the wedding.

614
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.967
and the banquet room
is already booked.

615
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.066
- So we have no wedding venue?

616
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.367
- [sighs]
I'm so sorry.

617
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.000
I've called
the insurance ten times.

618
00:29:09.133 --> 00:29:10.467
- It's okay.
We'll figure it out.

619
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.967
- Hey!
My parents just arrived!

620
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.834
- Hi. Victoria.
- Hi.

621
00:29:14.967 --> 00:29:18.066
- What's wrong?
Is the sky falling?

622
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.066
- No. just the ceiling.

623
00:29:28.734 --> 00:29:29.934
- Oh. this is not decaf.
so don't tell Seth.

624
00:29:30.066 --> 00:29:31.500
[laughter]

625
00:29:31.633 --> 00:29:34.800
- Whoo!
- Mmm. so good!

626
00:29:34.934 --> 00:29:36.467
- Are you still thinking
about the daffodils?

627
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.934
- No.

628
00:29:38.066 --> 00:29:40.433
I guess losing the venue
has made me wonder

629
00:29:40.567 --> 00:29:42.633
if this wedding
is somehow wrong.

630
00:29:42.767 --> 00:29:44.934
if I should've chosen
something different.

631
00:29:45.066 --> 00:29:46.500
like a ceremony
at a courthouse.

632
00:29:46.633 --> 00:29:48.166
or we could've eloped.

633
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.800
- No one's eloping.

634
00:29:49.934 --> 00:29:51.834
- Well. we could've planned
many different weddings.

635
00:29:51.967 --> 00:29:53.000
but I thought you wanted

636
00:29:53.133 --> 00:29:54.800
the big destination wedding
in Paris.

637
00:29:54.934 --> 00:29:57.066
- Yeah. I did.
I do!

638
00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.266
I'm just spinning out.
This is incredible.

639
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.266
Paris is the most
romantic place in the world.

640
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.567
[cell phone beeps]

641
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.934
Speaking of romance. Nathalie.

642
00:30:05.066 --> 00:30:06.467
how was your big night out
with Seth?

643
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.900
- Oh. well. we didn't go
because Seth was worried

644
00:30:09.033 --> 00:30:10.934
about me overtiring myself.

645
00:30:11.066 --> 00:30:12.633
so instead he gave me
a foot massage.

646
00:30:12.767 --> 00:30:14.233
- That's romantic.

647
00:30:14.367 --> 00:30:16.066
- Because he was worried
about my ankles swelling.

648
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.767
- Less romantic.
- Yep.

649
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.200
[chuckles]

650
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.500
- We've lost her again.

651
00:30:23.633 --> 00:30:25.567
- Sorry.
Muting the phone.

652
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.767
Oh. but we should get going

653
00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.967
'cause the cooking class
is across town.

654
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.633
- Cooking class?

655
00:30:29.767 --> 00:30:30.967
- Victoria booked us
a cooking class

656
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.500
as a wedding week activity.

657
00:30:32.633 --> 00:30:34.467
- Oh. Victoria!

658
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.567
- But shouldn't we be focused
on finding a venue?

659
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.100
- We'll find one.
Don't worry.

660
00:30:38.233 --> 00:30:40.934
For now.
let's just relax and cook.

661
00:30:41.066 --> 00:30:44.066
Two words I don't usually
find synonymous.

662
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.433
- And so. is Jacques
coming to the class?

663
00:30:47.567 --> 00:30:49.133
- Maybe.

664
00:30:49.266 --> 00:30:50.900
[quirky music]

665
00:30:51.033 --> 00:30:53.800
Please. don't make
those faces around him.

666
00:30:53.934 --> 00:30:55.066
- No promises.

667
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.367
[laughter]

668
00:30:57.867 --> 00:30:59.734
- Today. we will learn to make

669
00:30:59.867 --> 00:31:02.333
a very typical French dish.
ratatouille.

670
00:31:02.467 --> 00:31:05.467
followed by a tarte aux pommes.
so let's get cooking.

671
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.333
- Oh. that sounds delicious.

672
00:31:07.467 --> 00:31:09.900
[soft applause]

673
00:31:10.033 --> 00:31:11.633
- Excuse me. chef.

674
00:31:11.767 --> 00:31:14.133
While ratatouille and tarte aux
pommes do sound delicious.

675
00:31:14.266 --> 00:31:15.567
but when I booked this class

676
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.166
I thought we'd be making
something a little fancier.

677
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.567
- Yes. but the point
isn't for it to be fancy.

678
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.200
The point is for it
to be enjoyed. right?

679
00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:24.400
- Right. but--

680
00:31:24.533 --> 00:31:26.533
- [laughing]
- Ugh!

681
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.500
- Right.

682
00:31:30.633 --> 00:31:33.000
I see that now.

683
00:31:39.867 --> 00:31:41.133
- Is everything okay?

684
00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:42.500
- I've been having this gut
feeling lately.

685
00:31:42.633 --> 00:31:44.133
I couldn't figure out
what it was.

686
00:31:44.266 --> 00:31:47.567
but now I realized I planned
Tracy a Victoria Lewis wedding.

687
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.834
Complex. lavish. fancy.

688
00:31:49.967 --> 00:31:52.867
But maybe not enjoyable.
at least not for her and Mike.

689
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.133
Now Tracy feels like
her wedding is wrong

690
00:31:55.266 --> 00:31:57.333
because it is wrong for her.

691
00:31:57.467 --> 00:31:59.166
[sighs]
Gosh.

692
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.033
She really relied on me.
and I messed this up.

693
00:32:02.166 --> 00:32:04.600
- But it's okay.
You can fix it.

694
00:32:04.734 --> 00:32:06.767
You have. how long?

695
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.700
- Six days.

696
00:32:08.834 --> 00:32:11.400
Six days to replan
an entire wedding.

697
00:32:11.533 --> 00:32:13.533
- Well. then.
you better get cooking.

698
00:32:13.667 --> 00:32:16.600
- Okay. yeah.
Let's do this.

699
00:32:16.734 --> 00:32:19.500
- Here.
- Okay.

700
00:32:20.567 --> 00:32:21.800
- Comme Ã§a.

701
00:32:21.934 --> 00:32:26.300
And then around like that.

702
00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:38.867
I...

703
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.767
We're missing eggs
for the tart.

704
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.734
- [exhales softly]

705
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.567
- Hi.
- Hi.

706
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.800
- How are you?
- Fine.

707
00:32:56.934 --> 00:32:59.800
- Okay. um...

708
00:32:59.934 --> 00:33:01.667
[clears throat]

709
00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.533
Does it feel weird for you.
us not being here together?

710
00:33:07.567 --> 00:33:09.934
- Bonjour. Cameron.
- Hey. yeah.

711
00:33:10.066 --> 00:33:11.300
- Did you need something?

712
00:33:11.433 --> 00:33:15.300
- Um. I was looking for. um.
an egg.

713
00:33:15.433 --> 00:33:17.533
- Well...

714
00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:21.333
- [clears throat]

715
00:33:24.266 --> 00:33:26.300
Sorry.

716
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.200
- Victoria. I was thinking.
maybe tomorrow you could come

717
00:33:31.333 --> 00:33:33.934
to the chateau and we could
brainstorm wedding venues.

718
00:33:34.066 --> 00:33:36.166
- I would love that.

719
00:33:40.333 --> 00:33:41.767
- We need to get cooking.

720
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.200
Come on.

721
00:33:54.934 --> 00:33:57.000
- Bonjour.
- [exhales]

722
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.934
When you said chateau.

723
00:34:01.066 --> 00:34:03.600
I didn't know
that was French for palace.

724
00:34:03.734 --> 00:34:05.166
- It's just a country home.

725
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.400
- For who?
Louis XIV?

726
00:34:08.533 --> 00:34:11.533
You are now legitimately
a fairy-tale prince.

727
00:34:11.667 --> 00:34:14.667
- Yeah. but I didn't need
a chateau for that.

728
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.333
- [laughs]

729
00:34:17.467 --> 00:34:19.200
So. this was
your grandparents'?

730
00:34:19.333 --> 00:34:22.233
- Yeah. they bought it
almost 70 years ago.

731
00:34:22.367 --> 00:34:24.700
It was out of their budget
and totally crumbling.

732
00:34:24.834 --> 00:34:26.934
but my grandmother
fell in love with it.

733
00:34:27.066 --> 00:34:29.900
- So you come from a long line
of romantics?

734
00:34:30.033 --> 00:34:32.066
- Something like that.

735
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.533
My grandparents restored it.

736
00:34:33.667 --> 00:34:35.266
and then my parents
added in the gardens.

737
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.934
which was their hobby.

738
00:34:37.066 --> 00:34:40.066
and then they
passed it on to me.

739
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.767
- Wow.
Very lucky you.

740
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.233
[both laugh]

741
00:34:44.367 --> 00:34:46.400
This staircase!

742
00:34:46.533 --> 00:34:48.834
Those windows!

743
00:34:48.967 --> 00:34:51.166
[gasps]

744
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.400
I can't believe you live here.

745
00:34:54.533 --> 00:34:56.834
It must add so much glamour
to doing your laundry.

746
00:34:56.967 --> 00:34:58.533
- [laughs]

747
00:34:58.667 --> 00:35:01.734
Well. it's only ever
so glamorous folding socks.

748
00:35:01.867 --> 00:35:05.500
But I do live here.
at least for now.

749
00:35:05.633 --> 00:35:07.567
- For now?
- Yeah.

750
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.600
I'm considering selling it to
the Newton-Abbott Hotel Group.

751
00:35:10.734 --> 00:35:13.400
- That huge hotel chain?
- You're not a fan of the idea?

752
00:35:13.533 --> 00:35:16.934
- No. no.
I'm just surprised.

753
00:35:17.066 --> 00:35:20.233
- Yeah.
I'm surprised too.

754
00:35:20.367 --> 00:35:22.100
My family had their lives here.

755
00:35:22.233 --> 00:35:24.633
and I always thought
I'd have the same.

756
00:35:24.767 --> 00:35:28.100
But maybe I want
something different. you know?

757
00:35:28.233 --> 00:35:30.600
I always feel most alive
when I'm wandering the world

758
00:35:30.734 --> 00:35:33.900
and chasing adventures
and meeting new people.

759
00:35:34.033 --> 00:35:37.967
and I can't do that
with the chateau.

760
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.767
It requires a lot of upkeep.

761
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.233
- Look at you complaining
about owning a castle.

762
00:35:45.367 --> 00:35:48.200
- [laughs]
Well. I am French. you know?

763
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.333
- I guess I just don't really
understand the issue

764
00:35:53.467 --> 00:35:55.133
with the chateau.

765
00:35:55.266 --> 00:35:59.166
- I guess it gets lonely here.

766
00:36:00.266 --> 00:36:02.066
- Well. you could adopt a dog.
- [laughs]

767
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.400
- Or a pack of dogs.

768
00:36:04.533 --> 00:36:06.233
Or you could repurpose it.

769
00:36:06.367 --> 00:36:09.133
Forget Newton-Abbott. you could
turn this into a hotel.

770
00:36:09.266 --> 00:36:11.467
- Yeah. you know what.
I've thought about it.

771
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.200
but it's a big project.

772
00:36:13.333 --> 00:36:14.900
It's too big for just me.

773
00:36:15.033 --> 00:36:16.700
- Well. start small.
just a few rooms.

774
00:36:16.834 --> 00:36:19.333
You could host events here.

775
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.000
You could hold weddings here.

776
00:36:23.133 --> 00:36:24.867
- [laughs softly]

777
00:36:35.734 --> 00:36:36.700
- You have to see it.

778
00:36:36.834 --> 00:36:39.700
Jacques' chateau is stunning.

779
00:36:39.834 --> 00:36:41.934
It's. like. straight out
of a wedding magazine.

780
00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:45.367
- Wait. wait. wait.
Jacques has a chateau?

781
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.734
- But more than that. Tracy.

782
00:36:46.867 --> 00:36:49.567
It's just so you.
It's unique.

783
00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.033
- It just seems like a lot
to ask of Jacques.

784
00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:53.700
He's really okay hosting?

785
00:36:53.834 --> 00:36:55.367
- Oh. more than okay.
Yeah. he's excited.

786
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.066
- Excited?

787
00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.767
- And I assume that by holding
the wedding there.

788
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.967
you know. you two could spend
a lot more time together.

789
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.433
- Ooh.

790
00:37:02.567 --> 00:37:04.800
- Trace. so what do you say?

791
00:37:04.934 --> 00:37:07.066
Do you wanna see the chateau?

792
00:37:08.767 --> 00:37:11.000
- Field trip?
[laughter]

793
00:37:14.066 --> 00:37:16.133
- Wow.
- All this?

794
00:37:16.266 --> 00:37:19.000
- Would you look at this?
[laughter]

795
00:37:19.133 --> 00:37:22.467
- Hey. if I get lost in there
I'll drop a pin.

796
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.934
- So. the whole crew is here?

797
00:37:24.066 --> 00:37:25.934
- We roll deep.
[chuckles]

798
00:37:26.066 --> 00:37:28.800
- Well. come in.
It's special for everyone.

799
00:37:28.934 --> 00:37:33.700
- Can you believe this?
It has over 30 rooms.

800
00:37:33.834 --> 00:37:35.133
- Who cleans it?
- I know!

801
00:37:35.266 --> 00:37:38.100
- [laughs]

802
00:37:38.233 --> 00:37:41.700
- So. what do you think?

803
00:37:41.834 --> 00:37:44.166
- I think you
didn't oversell it.

804
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.300
- It's gorgeous.

805
00:37:46.433 --> 00:37:49.533
- So. is that a yes?
- Yes. that's a yes.

806
00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:51.367
- Yes.
It's a yes.

807
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.133
No indecision.
No waffling.

808
00:37:55.266 --> 00:37:57.033
Maybe.
No. I'm just kidding.

809
00:37:57.166 --> 00:37:58.834
[laughter]

810
00:37:58.967 --> 00:38:00.734
- This is so generous
of Jacques.

811
00:38:00.867 --> 00:38:02.433
- Where do you think
we should hold the ceremony?

812
00:38:02.567 --> 00:38:05.400
- Oh. well. I thought we could
hold it over here in the...

813
00:38:10.333 --> 00:38:11.934
what do you two wanna do?

814
00:38:14.667 --> 00:38:20.734
- Um. maybe we hold the whole
thing in the garden?

815
00:38:20.867 --> 00:38:26.200
Maybe we place the altar
against the garden backdrop.

816
00:38:27.233 --> 00:38:29.000
- Perfect.

817
00:38:29.133 --> 00:38:32.667
A simple.
stunning garden wedding.

818
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.066
Ceremony under the setting sun.
dancing under the stars.

819
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.567
- Sounds beautiful.

820
00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.066
- But does it sound
like you two?

821
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.767
At the cooking class.
I realized

822
00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.567
I was throwing you the wedding
that I'm used to throwing.

823
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.233
I love you two so much.

824
00:38:46.367 --> 00:38:49.100
and I just wanted to make it
as big and lavish as possible.

825
00:38:49.233 --> 00:38:51.734
but in doing that.

826
00:38:51.867 --> 00:38:54.667
I lost sight of it being you.

827
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.333
Being right for you.

828
00:38:56.467 --> 00:38:59.533
- It's hard for me to know
what's right for this wedding.

829
00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:02.266
But. Vic. it's all been great.

830
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.834
We appreciate
everything you've done.

831
00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:08.567
- Well. it's an honor.
and it will be exquisite.

832
00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.133
And now. I just have to
figure out how to get it

833
00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:13.567
all done in five days.

834
00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.767
Totally doable. by the way.

835
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.300
- Is the sky falling?

836
00:39:17.433 --> 00:39:19.000
- No.

837
00:39:19.133 --> 00:39:21.633
The heavens are
just readjusting.

838
00:39:21.767 --> 00:39:25.333
[laughter]

839
00:39:25.467 --> 00:39:26.967
- I know we have a ton to do.

840
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.467
but my parents
are just getting in.

841
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.500
so we're gonna
head to the hotel.

842
00:39:30.633 --> 00:39:33.066
- I have us booked on an
evening tour of the catacombs.

843
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.333
- Th-that's a lot of walking.

844
00:39:35.467 --> 00:39:37.333
Are you sure you don't want
to just stay in. rest up?

845
00:39:37.467 --> 00:39:39.433
- No. no.
Let's rally.

846
00:39:39.567 --> 00:39:41.266
- And I was hoping we could
catch the sunset

847
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.533
at the SacrÃ©-Coeur?
- Ooh. sounds good.

848
00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:47.467
- Okay. well.
how about we break for today

849
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.266
and meet back here
bright and early tomorrow?

850
00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.900
Is it okay if I stay
a little longer

851
00:39:53.033 --> 00:39:55.233
just to iron out
the to-do list?

852
00:39:55.367 --> 00:39:57.800
- Yeah. of course.
I'll cook us dinner.

853
00:40:05.367 --> 00:40:08.133
- So what exactly
are we making?

854
00:40:08.266 --> 00:40:11.467
- It's just a simple
salade niÃ§oise.

855
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.567
- You have 20 ingredients
and three burners going.

856
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.066
and yet it's simple?

857
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.834
- I take it
you don't cook much?

858
00:40:18.967 --> 00:40:21.667
- No. no.
[laughs]

859
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.000
I work late most nights.
and--cue your horror--

860
00:40:24.133 --> 00:40:27.100
I usually grab something
from a drive-through.

861
00:40:27.233 --> 00:40:29.266
- Fast food?
Oh lÃ  lÃ .

862
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.433
- Don't judge.
You eat slow food.

863
00:40:32.567 --> 00:40:33.800
- Hmm?

864
00:40:33.934 --> 00:40:36.333
- Escargot.

865
00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:38.600
- Victoria. that was terrible.

866
00:40:38.734 --> 00:40:40.433
Here.

867
00:40:40.567 --> 00:40:41.734
- Mmm.

868
00:40:41.867 --> 00:40:43.467
You know.
but I don't cook much.

869
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.567
It feels like you spend an hour
cooking. 10 minutes eating

870
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.834
and then three hours
cleaning up.

871
00:40:46.967 --> 00:40:48.900
and cooking for one.

872
00:40:49.033 --> 00:40:50.800
- What about when you were
with Cameron?

873
00:40:50.934 --> 00:40:53.133
- We weren't very good
in the kitchen together.

874
00:40:53.266 --> 00:40:55.333
or at any project together.

875
00:40:55.467 --> 00:40:56.967
We were both
fairly independent.

876
00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.734
Success is really important
to Cameron.

877
00:40:58.867 --> 00:41:00.967
- It seems like
it's important to you too.

878
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.734
- It is.
It was.

879
00:41:03.867 --> 00:41:06.133
No. it still is.

880
00:41:06.266 --> 00:41:10.700
But. you know. you get older
and you find yourself alone.

881
00:41:10.834 --> 00:41:13.133
sitting in your car.
eating a dinner of fries

882
00:41:13.266 --> 00:41:14.300
dipped in a milkshake
five nights a week.

883
00:41:14.433 --> 00:41:18.333
and you start to question
the definition of success.

884
00:41:18.467 --> 00:41:19.867
- You're lonely?

885
00:41:21.433 --> 00:41:23.300
- No. I'm happy by myself.

886
00:41:23.433 --> 00:41:26.166
I pride myself in being
a strong. independent woman.

887
00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.967
I can open jars
and assemble furniture alone.

888
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.200
but it does make me sad
to cook for one.

889
00:41:33.333 --> 00:41:34.533
- Hmm.

890
00:41:34.667 --> 00:41:35.900
What about you?

891
00:41:36.033 --> 00:41:37.467
Do you cook like this
when you're on your own?

892
00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.467
- Yeah. of course.
I mean. I enjoy it.

893
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.133
But I like to think
I'm worth the effort.

894
00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:43.400
- [laughs]

895
00:41:43.533 --> 00:41:44.834
- But. of course.

896
00:41:44.967 --> 00:41:47.800
I prefer cooking
for other people. you know?

897
00:41:47.934 --> 00:41:49.500
Inviting friends
and family over

898
00:41:49.633 --> 00:41:53.600
and having the house feel full.
that's when I'm the happiest.

899
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.033
- Well. that pack of dogs
would fill it.

900
00:41:56.166 --> 00:41:58.300
- Yeah. but imagine
what they'd do to the lawn.

901
00:41:58.433 --> 00:42:02.033
- [laughs]

902
00:42:02.166 --> 00:42:04.967
Well. that was incredible.
- Better than the croissant?

903
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.967
- Well. bake me some fresh
chocolate croissants right now

904
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.367
and I'll tell you.

905
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.100
- Well. no croissants
this evening.

906
00:42:10.233 --> 00:42:14.567
but I think I have
something even sweeter.

907
00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.834
- Oh.

908
00:42:22.667 --> 00:42:25.467
- A little something.
- Oh.

909
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.867
[gasps. laughs]

910
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.233
- [laughs]

911
00:42:30.367 --> 00:42:34.066
- My old letters?
You saved them?

912
00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.900
- Of course I saved them.
- [laughs]

913
00:42:38.033 --> 00:42:42.367
[sighs]
I poured my heart out to you.

914
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.100
I told you things
I never told anyone else.

915
00:42:45.233 --> 00:42:47.100
- Me too.

916
00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:53.834
- These letters are just a
place I could truly be myself.

917
00:42:56.533 --> 00:42:59.767
- You know. you broke my heart.

918
00:43:05.066 --> 00:43:09.333
- Well. you broke mine too.

919
00:43:09.467 --> 00:43:11.667
but we were just kids.

920
00:43:13.333 --> 00:43:14.800
- What does that mean?

921
00:43:14.934 --> 00:43:17.300
- That means that we were 17.

922
00:43:17.433 --> 00:43:20.000
and I was there
and you were here.

923
00:43:20.133 --> 00:43:24.834
and I just didn't see
how we could ever be together.

924
00:43:24.967 --> 00:43:26.367
You know. I started to wonder

925
00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:30.033
if we were just puppy love.

926
00:43:30.166 --> 00:43:32.867
or a fairy tale.

927
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.200
- But when did you stop
believing in fairy tales?

928
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.800
- I'm not sure.

929
00:43:43.166 --> 00:43:46.333
Maybe when I felt like it
was time to grow up.

930
00:43:46.467 --> 00:43:47.834
which was around
the same time I wondered

931
00:43:47.967 --> 00:43:52.400
if our love was actually real.

932
00:43:54.667 --> 00:43:56.867
- Isn't all love real?

933
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.533
- Well. maybe that's
the problem.

934
00:43:58.667 --> 00:44:00.700
that it gets too real.

935
00:44:02.467 --> 00:44:04.433
- Mm.

936
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.433
[exhales deeply]

937
00:44:16.367 --> 00:44:19.233
- [laughs softly]

938
00:44:19.367 --> 00:44:23.800
Well. I should get back
to the hotel.

939
00:44:25.233 --> 00:44:28.667
- Oui.
Oui. absolument.

940
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.367
- Okay.

941
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.266
- Um...
I'll take you back.

942
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.533
- Hi.
- Hi.

943
00:44:51.667 --> 00:44:54.667
- I sent you an email
about the walking tour.

944
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.200
- Yep.
Got the email.

945
00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.934
- Okay.

946
00:45:00.133 --> 00:45:02.900
- Was there something else?
- Yes--no--yes.

947
00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:05.266
Um...

948
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.900
I was wondering
if I had made a mistake.

949
00:45:08.033 --> 00:45:11.066
- I'm sure you've made
a lot of mistakes.

950
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.934
- No. I mean.
a mistake in us breaking up.

951
00:45:16.033 --> 00:45:22.600
Because I'm realizing
I still have feelings for you.

952
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.834
- Vic. you okay?

953
00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:39.433
- Mm.
I'm okay. yeah.

954
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.900
More cake. please.

955
00:45:42.033 --> 00:45:43.967
- Okay.
Is this about Cameron?

956
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:47.033
- I mean. I spent six months

957
00:45:47.166 --> 00:45:48.967
hoping that Cam and I
would get back together.

958
00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.000
and just as I'm finally
starting to get over him

959
00:45:51.133 --> 00:45:53.967
he tells me
that he still has feelings.

960
00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.000
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

961
00:45:56.133 --> 00:45:57.400
I can't just go
running back to Cam.

962
00:45:57.533 --> 00:45:58.734
- As you shouldn't.

963
00:45:58.867 --> 00:46:00.200
- But also.
it's very complicated.

964
00:46:00.333 --> 00:46:01.734
- You have a history with him.

965
00:46:01.867 --> 00:46:03.066
- I thought I was gonna
have a future with him.

966
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.900
a home. a marriage. a family.

967
00:46:06.033 --> 00:46:07.734
And I don't know.
when he broke up with me

968
00:46:07.867 --> 00:46:09.100
it just felt like
I lost the life

969
00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:12.367
I thought I was gonna have.

970
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.967
And what about Jen?
They seem great together.

971
00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.900
- What about Jacques?

972
00:46:17.033 --> 00:46:19.967
- Okay.
this isn't about Jacques.

973
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.767
Well. maybe it is. because
spending time with Jacques

974
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.033
reminds me of all the things
I hoped for before Cam.

975
00:46:24.166 --> 00:46:25.900
- Which was?
- I don't know.

976
00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:27.433
All my dreams
manifest into a life

977
00:46:27.567 --> 00:46:28.734
of eternal happiness
guaranteed.

978
00:46:28.867 --> 00:46:30.533
- [laughs]

979
00:46:30.667 --> 00:46:33.033
So. all the reasonable asks.
- Yeah.

980
00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:34.734
- Speaking of eternal
happiness guaranteed.

981
00:46:34.867 --> 00:46:35.900
what says that more:

982
00:46:36.033 --> 00:46:38.100
lemon chiffon
or salted caramel?

983
00:46:38.233 --> 00:46:39.734
- Oh.
Um...

984
00:46:39.867 --> 00:46:42.533
- Or.
instead of just one flavor.

985
00:46:42.667 --> 00:46:45.967
we could do something
a little more fun?

986
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.333
- I'm listening.
- [laughs]

987
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.433
[laughter]

988
00:46:51.567 --> 00:46:53.200
- What are we gonna do
if it rains?

989
00:46:53.333 --> 00:46:54.633
- Ugh. the one thing out

990
00:46:54.767 --> 00:46:57.700
of every wedding planner's
control: the weather.

991
00:46:57.834 --> 00:47:00.700
The sky isn't falling.
Not yet. anyway.

992
00:47:00.834 --> 00:47:02.967
- Honey. why don't you show me
the rest of the chateau.

993
00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.367
- Okay.

994
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.667
- Oh. Seth and I are going
on a food tour.

995
00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:06.767
I'm gonna eat everything.

996
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.266
- Yeah.
- All of it.

997
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.834
[laughter]

998
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.934
- Ah. Victoria.

999
00:47:19.066 --> 00:47:21.333
This is Alex from
the Newton-Abbot Hotel Group.

1000
00:47:21.467 --> 00:47:23.000
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. you too.

1001
00:47:23.133 --> 00:47:25.533
- Alex was just
pressing me for news.

1002
00:47:25.667 --> 00:47:28.934
but. alas. I'm undecided.

1003
00:47:29.066 --> 00:47:33.033
- Okay. we do need to know
by the end of the week. though.

1004
00:47:33.166 --> 00:47:34.834
I should get going.
Enjoy.

1005
00:47:34.967 --> 00:47:37.667
- Salut.

1006
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.767
He keeps bringing me
gift baskets.

1007
00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.600
like that's somehow
gonna help me determine

1008
00:47:41.734 --> 00:47:43.934
the course of my life.

1009
00:47:44.066 --> 00:47:47.266
I mean. the wine
is a nice touch. but...

1010
00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.133
- I'm beginning to think
the chateau sale

1011
00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:51.834
is about more
than just travel and upkeep.

1012
00:47:51.967 --> 00:47:53.467
- It is.

1013
00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.467
You know. I thought I'd always
thought I'd spend my 20s

1014
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.867
traveling the world and finding
myself along the way.

1015
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.834
- [chortles]
'Cause it's that easy.

1016
00:48:00.967 --> 00:48:02.233
- Exactly.

1017
00:48:02.367 --> 00:48:04.000
And then. I'd come back here.

1018
00:48:04.133 --> 00:48:05.767
I'd get married.
I'd start a family.

1019
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.166
And instead. I'm alone.

1020
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.734
and the chateau is a reminder
of what I don't have.

1021
00:48:12.867 --> 00:48:14.834
You know. I always had
big dreams for this place.

1022
00:48:14.967 --> 00:48:17.266
Turning it into something else.

1023
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.367
but I always felt I'd do that
with a partner.

1024
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.100
- I get that.

1025
00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:25.100
Sometimes we have to let
go of the life

1026
00:48:25.233 --> 00:48:26.734
we thought we'd have
with someone else

1027
00:48:26.867 --> 00:48:32.333
so we can try to build a life
of our own.

1028
00:48:32.467 --> 00:48:35.900
Or at least try.

1029
00:48:36.033 --> 00:48:39.200
- Are you letting go of that
with Cameron?

1030
00:48:41.834 --> 00:48:45.066
- Um...
[clears throat]

1031
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.000
Well. he...

1032
00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:51.767
yesterday. he told me
he still has feelings for me.

1033
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.734
- And do you still
have feelings for him?

1034
00:48:58.033 --> 00:49:00.667
- I don't know.

1035
00:49:08.533 --> 00:49:10.633
[indistinct chatter]

1036
00:49:10.767 --> 00:49:12.467
- Oh.

1037
00:49:15.533 --> 00:49:16.767
Hey!

1038
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.600
- Hey.

1039
00:49:18.734 --> 00:49:20.066
- How was your food tour?

1040
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.800
- [sighs]
Seth was worried about me

1041
00:49:21.934 --> 00:49:23.667
being near soft cheeses
and charcuterie.

1042
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.734
so instead we did
a city bus tour.

1043
00:49:26.867 --> 00:49:28.867
A lot of selfie-snapping
tourists.

1044
00:49:31.433 --> 00:49:33.500
- Honey. what's going on?

1045
00:49:33.633 --> 00:49:35.467
- You know. Seth and I
were always active.

1046
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.567
adventurous.
spontaneous people.

1047
00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.633
Ever since I got pregnant.
all he wants to do

1048
00:49:39.767 --> 00:49:42.467
is research diapers
and practice hypnobirthing.

1049
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.967
I feel like he's losing sight
of us and who we are.

1050
00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.800
- Hi. guys.

1051
00:49:51.934 --> 00:49:54.300
- Well. talk to him.

1052
00:49:54.433 --> 00:49:56.300
- Okay.
Well. I'll see you guys later.

1053
00:49:56.433 --> 00:49:58.200
Oh. God.
[grunts]

1054
00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.166
- Tell me about your day.

1055
00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.633
- Well. my employee. Mia.

1056
00:50:04.767 --> 00:50:09.467
is planning her first wedding.
and she's just so excited.

1057
00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.333
- Why do you look sad
about that?

1058
00:50:13.734 --> 00:50:16.900
- I guess I miss being excited.

1059
00:50:17.033 --> 00:50:20.467
You know. I realized that for
years I've been on autopilot.

1060
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.500
and Tracy's wedding
falling apart

1061
00:50:22.633 --> 00:50:24.834
is the first time that I'm not.

1062
00:50:24.967 --> 00:50:27.600
- So does that mean you want
to do things differently.

1063
00:50:27.734 --> 00:50:29.967
or you want to do
different things?

1064
00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.600
- I don't know.

1065
00:50:32.734 --> 00:50:36.900
I have this dream
of taking a break.

1066
00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:38.600
and I know that's
the same dream everyone has.

1067
00:50:38.734 --> 00:50:41.100
to take a breather
from everyday life to just--

1068
00:50:41.233 --> 00:50:42.767
- Wander?

1069
00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.467
- Wander.
Yes.

1070
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.767
Travel.
Try new things.

1071
00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.834
Find myself. as you would say.

1072
00:50:48.967 --> 00:50:51.166
- So do it.

1073
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.233
- I built a business. a brand.

1074
00:50:54.367 --> 00:50:56.300
To give that up to chase
some unknown dream.

1075
00:50:56.433 --> 00:50:58.834
I'd be setting myself
up for failure.

1076
00:50:58.967 --> 00:51:02.800
- No--I mean. only if you
perceive it as a failure.

1077
00:51:02.934 --> 00:51:04.233
I mean. take
the Arc de Triomphe.

1078
00:51:04.367 --> 00:51:07.400
Everybody thinks that
it's a monument to triumph.

1079
00:51:07.533 --> 00:51:09.166
but no one realizes
the real triumph

1080
00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.367
was in its construction.

1081
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.567
It took 30 years to build.

1082
00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:15.567
The real triumph is not
in the final product.

1083
00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:18.333
it's in the journey.

1084
00:51:18.467 --> 00:51:22.567
What I'm trying to say
is it's not about success.

1085
00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.200
It's--it's about what we learn.

1086
00:51:26.333 --> 00:51:28.200
- I like that.

1087
00:51:28.333 --> 00:51:30.066
Even if the analogy
is kind of random.

1088
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.900
- It's not so random.

1089
00:51:35.433 --> 00:51:38.000
- How are these giant
architectural marvels

1090
00:51:38.133 --> 00:51:39.367
constantly right in front
of my face.

1091
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.367
and I never see them?

1092
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.934
- It's 'cause you are too busy
looking at me.

1093
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.233
[both laugh softly]

1094
00:52:04.166 --> 00:52:05.967
- Hi.
- Hi.

1095
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.700
- Um. where are you off to?

1096
00:52:07.834 --> 00:52:10.000
- I was just gonna check in
on the caterer.

1097
00:52:10.133 --> 00:52:11.667
- Can I join?

1098
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.900
It's probably my duty
as the best man. right?

1099
00:52:15.033 --> 00:52:17.567
- Okay.
Sure.

1100
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.400
- Three days to plan.
prepare. and cook

1101
00:52:25.533 --> 00:52:27.800
a sit-down multi-course meal
for all those people?

1102
00:52:27.934 --> 00:52:29.233
It's just not possible.

1103
00:52:29.367 --> 00:52:32.166
- I know it's not possible.
but what is possible

1104
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.800
is something casual.
something fun.

1105
00:52:34.934 --> 00:52:37.567
Croque monsieurs. poutine.
salade niÃ§oise.

1106
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.333
maybe even a crepe bar.

1107
00:52:41.834 --> 00:52:43.867
Like someone very wise

1108
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000
and very much needed to cater
this wedding once told me.

1109
00:52:47.133 --> 00:52:50.233
"The point isn't to be fancy."

1110
00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:52.967
- [sighs]
All right.

1111
00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.533
- Yes!
- Excellent.

1112
00:52:56.667 --> 00:52:59.333
You were great in there.

1113
00:52:59.467 --> 00:53:01.233
It was like having
the old Victoria back.

1114
00:53:01.367 --> 00:53:06.066
passionate. fiery. persistent.
sometimes annoyingly so.

1115
00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.133
- [laughs]
Yes.

1116
00:53:09.266 --> 00:53:12.300
- So. I talked to Jen.

1117
00:53:12.433 --> 00:53:15.700
told her I think
I still have feelings for you.

1118
00:53:15.834 --> 00:53:18.567
- Oh. wow.

1119
00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:21.400
How did she take that?

1120
00:53:21.533 --> 00:53:23.934
- Well. she was upset.

1121
00:53:24.066 --> 00:53:26.700
but she understood.

1122
00:53:26.834 --> 00:53:29.867
She knows you and I
have history together.

1123
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.467
plus it's complicated.

1124
00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.800
We were friends and coworkers
for a long time.

1125
00:53:34.934 --> 00:53:36.433
Sometimes it's hard to know

1126
00:53:36.567 --> 00:53:39.233
if our dynamic is
just a friendship or more.

1127
00:53:39.367 --> 00:53:40.900
- I think Jen's great.

1128
00:53:41.033 --> 00:53:43.100
and I think
she could be great for you.

1129
00:53:43.233 --> 00:53:45.567
- But you were also good.

1130
00:53:47.667 --> 00:53:49.734
- You know. I should get back
to the hotel.

1131
00:53:49.867 --> 00:53:53.100
So I'll see you
at the architecture tour.

1132
00:53:55.667 --> 00:53:58.066
- [sighs deeply]

1133
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.800
- Hi. I'm here to pick up
the dress for Tracy Cook.

1134
00:54:00.934 --> 00:54:02.800
- Mm-hmm.

1135
00:54:09.266 --> 00:54:13.734
- Actually.
there's something else.

1136
00:54:17.967 --> 00:54:20.100
Guess who found a caterer?
- Oh. whew!

1137
00:54:20.233 --> 00:54:21.767
I was starting to resign myself

1138
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.800
to ordering pizza
for the reception. or Chinese.

1139
00:54:24.934 --> 00:54:27.133
- She can't decide.
- Of course.

1140
00:54:27.266 --> 00:54:29.967
- But now we have
a new problem.

1141
00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.800
- Oh. great. I hate to relax.
Lay it on me.

1142
00:54:32.934 --> 00:54:36.533
- Our pastor suddenly can't
make it to the wedding.

1143
00:54:36.667 --> 00:54:38.266
- Okay. so we need to find

1144
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.667
someone to officiate
the ceremony.

1145
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.266
- Yeah. and we have
someone in mind.

1146
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.133
- [gasps]
Great--who?

1147
00:54:44.266 --> 00:54:46.300
- You.
- Me?

1148
00:54:46.433 --> 00:54:49.200
- You know us
and love us so much.

1149
00:54:49.333 --> 00:54:51.266
and you're heartfelt
and hilarious.

1150
00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.500
and the best friend.

1151
00:54:55.433 --> 00:54:58.533
So. will you marry us?

1152
00:55:00.367 --> 00:55:01.934
- It would be an honor.

1153
00:55:02.066 --> 00:55:05.200
[laughter]

1154
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.834
- This was one wedding decision
that was easy to make.

1155
00:55:08.967 --> 00:55:10.567
- Well. I'm glad there was one.

1156
00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.367
- Ah. other than the decision
to marry me. of course.

1157
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.934
- Of course. other than that.

1158
00:55:15.066 --> 00:55:17.333
- Well. lucky for all of us.
I'm already ordained.

1159
00:55:17.467 --> 00:55:19.667
Wedding planner equivalent of
packing three pairs of heels.

1160
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.367
So. three days to pen
a touching homage to your love

1161
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.700
that you'll remember forever?

1162
00:55:24.834 --> 00:55:26.700
On it.

1163
00:55:26.834 --> 00:55:30.233
- To the right you can see
the Louis Le Vau influence

1164
00:55:30.367 --> 00:55:34.066
with the mansard roof
and prominent cupola.

1165
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.900
- What is a mansard cupola?
[both laugh]

1166
00:55:38.033 --> 00:55:40.200
- I think she's making it up.

1167
00:55:40.333 --> 00:55:43.767
- And now. we can take a break
for a petit goÃ»ter.

1168
00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.934
- Oh. well.
now she's speaking my language.

1169
00:55:48.066 --> 00:55:49.500
- Yeah?
- Always.

1170
00:55:49.633 --> 00:55:51.667
- Come on.
- [laughs]

1171
00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.100
I used to think
architecture tours

1172
00:55:53.233 --> 00:55:54.900
were the seventh
circle of boring.

1173
00:55:55.033 --> 00:55:58.333
but eating a fresh beignet
on a sunny day in Paris.

1174
00:55:58.467 --> 00:56:00.300
I am sold.

1175
00:56:00.433 --> 00:56:01.900
- Well. don't tell anyone.

1176
00:56:02.033 --> 00:56:03.266
but next time
you can just skip the tour

1177
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.734
and go straight
to the beignets.

1178
00:56:04.867 --> 00:56:06.900
[both laugh]

1179
00:56:07.033 --> 00:56:09.333
You have--you have a little--
- What?

1180
00:56:09.467 --> 00:56:11.133
Hmm?
- Sugar. here.

1181
00:56:11.266 --> 00:56:13.033
- Oh.

1182
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.667
- Did I really.

1183
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.834
or were you just looking
for an excuse to get closer?

1184
00:56:18.967 --> 00:56:20.834
- [laughs]

1185
00:56:20.967 --> 00:56:22.967
I don't need an excuse.

1186
00:56:30.367 --> 00:56:31.900
- How about we sneak off
and you can show me

1187
00:56:32.033 --> 00:56:33.767
another site
on our Tour de France?

1188
00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:37.467
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.

1189
00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.934
You know what's strange?

1190
00:56:39.066 --> 00:56:42.967
I'm here.
and yet I already miss it.

1191
00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:45.500
- That because you've
become a Parisian.

1192
00:56:45.633 --> 00:56:48.166
- I've been here for six days.
I'm hardly a Parisian.

1193
00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:51.000
- Being a Parisian
isn't about living in Paris.

1194
00:56:51.133 --> 00:56:54.567
it's about
coming alive in Paris.

1195
00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.800
- Well. then I guess
I'm an honorary Parisian.

1196
00:56:56.934 --> 00:56:58.667
- Exactly.

1197
00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:02.200
- Tu me manques. Paris.

1198
00:57:02.333 --> 00:57:03.834
That means
"I'll miss you Paris." right?

1199
00:57:03.967 --> 00:57:05.867
- Um. sort of.

1200
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.033
"Tu me manques" in French
doesn't mean "I miss you."

1201
00:57:09.166 --> 00:57:13.867
"Tu me manques" means
"you are missing from me."

1202
00:57:25.934 --> 00:57:29.233
So this used to be
the Pont des Arts.

1203
00:57:29.367 --> 00:57:30.900
- Oh. the bridge
covered in locks?

1204
00:57:31.033 --> 00:57:32.734
- Exactement.

1205
00:57:32.867 --> 00:57:36.734
Couples in love would come here
and write their name on a lock.

1206
00:57:36.867 --> 00:57:41.333
put it on the bridge. and then
throw the key into the Seine.

1207
00:57:41.467 --> 00:57:42.867
- So where are all the locks?

1208
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.567
- Yeah. well. the weight made
the bridge collapse.

1209
00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.066
so they had to be cut off.

1210
00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:48.233
- Oh. that's sad.

1211
00:57:48.367 --> 00:57:49.700
- I don't think so.

1212
00:57:49.834 --> 00:57:52.333
I know it was supposed
to be romantic.

1213
00:57:52.467 --> 00:57:55.133
but for me it was
the opposite. you know?

1214
00:57:55.266 --> 00:57:59.166
Because love is not a lock.

1215
00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.033
The heart is not something
that should be unlocked.

1216
00:58:03.166 --> 00:58:06.900
You don't need to give someone
a key if it's already opened.

1217
00:58:07.033 --> 00:58:10.100
- You wrote something like that
in a letter.

1218
00:58:10.233 --> 00:58:12.600
one of your last letters to me.

1219
00:58:12.734 --> 00:58:15.133
- I remember.

1220
00:58:15.266 --> 00:58:19.200
I was trying to explain
why I didn't fight for us.

1221
00:58:19.333 --> 00:58:21.734
because I believe
if you love something

1222
00:58:21.867 --> 00:58:24.967
and it don't love you.
you set it free.

1223
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:26.400
And if it comes back to you.

1224
00:58:26.533 --> 00:58:29.834
then you know
it was meant to be.

1225
00:58:31.834 --> 00:58:35.133
- Yes. but you also might have
to fight for it.

1226
00:58:35.266 --> 00:58:40.100
because you say "set free."
but I hear "give up."

1227
00:58:40.233 --> 00:58:42.767
And it's not just
giving up what is.

1228
00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.867
it's giving up the possibility
of what could be.

1229
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.066
- Mm-hmm.

1230
00:58:51.533 --> 00:58:55.200
So you're glad that
you came to Paris?

1231
00:58:55.333 --> 00:58:56.734
It was a good idea.

1232
00:58:56.867 --> 00:58:59.233
- "Paris is always
a good idea."

1233
00:59:02.433 --> 00:59:05.767
- "I have learned how to live.

1234
00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:09.100
"How to be in the world
and of the world.

1235
00:59:09.233 --> 00:59:12.166
"and not just stand and watch.

1236
00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:14.967
"I will never. ever again

1237
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:18.700
run away from life
or from love either."

1238
00:59:21.734 --> 00:59:24.667
It's Audrey Hepburn
in "Sabrina."

1239
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.133
- Yeah.

1240
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:35.166
- [laughs softly]

1241
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.967
[sighs]

1242
00:59:45.333 --> 00:59:47.600
- Two days to go.
Excited?

1243
00:59:47.734 --> 00:59:51.100
- I've never been more ready.

1244
00:59:51.233 --> 00:59:52.967
Everything okay?

1245
00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.433
- Yeah. I'm trying to decide
which candles to go for.

1246
00:59:55.567 --> 00:59:57.300
- I like the pink one.

1247
00:59:57.433 --> 00:59:59.133
- Yeah. but the white's
more elegant. don't you think?

1248
00:59:59.266 --> 01:00:00.700
- White's nice.
Which one do you like better?

1249
01:00:00.834 --> 01:00:02.934
- I don't know.
[both laugh]

1250
01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:04.900
- Imagine when we have
to decide on paint colors

1251
01:00:05.033 --> 01:00:07.233
for our new home.

1252
01:00:10.533 --> 01:00:11.567
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. honey.

1253
01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.433
You shouldn't be lifting that.
Come on.

1254
01:00:13.567 --> 01:00:15.533
- Seth. come on. I'm fine.
We just talked about this.

1255
01:00:15.667 --> 01:00:16.734
- Yeah. I know. and I told you.

1256
01:00:16.867 --> 01:00:18.567
I'm just trying
to look out for you.

1257
01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:22.133
- Just--I don't need to be
looked out for!

1258
01:00:26.433 --> 01:00:28.400
- What did I do?

1259
01:00:31.233 --> 01:00:34.066
- Nat?
What's wrong?

1260
01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.133
- I tried to talk to Seth.
and nothing has changed.

1261
01:00:40.433 --> 01:00:41.633
If anything. he's got worse.

1262
01:00:41.767 --> 01:00:43.233
- Oh. honey.

1263
01:00:43.367 --> 01:00:44.700
- Now I'm sitting here
remembering

1264
01:00:44.834 --> 01:00:48.133
how perfect our wedding was.

1265
01:00:48.266 --> 01:00:50.400
how exciting and romantic.

1266
01:00:50.533 --> 01:00:51.867
I don't know.
Just everything is changing.

1267
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.633
Everything is different.

1268
01:00:53.767 --> 01:00:55.700
Oh. no.
I think I'm scaring Tracy.

1269
01:00:55.834 --> 01:00:57.934
- No. you're not scaring me.

1270
01:00:58.066 --> 01:00:59.233
because I'm already scared.

1271
01:00:59.367 --> 01:01:01.633
- You are?
Of what?

1272
01:01:01.767 --> 01:01:03.667
- I don't know.

1273
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.800
Nathalie saying everything
changing. getting married.

1274
01:01:06.934 --> 01:01:10.266
a new life. baby names.
paint colors.

1275
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.700
Brr.

1276
01:01:12.834 --> 01:01:14.867
What if this
is the wrong choice?

1277
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.767
What if marriage isn't right
for every couple?

1278
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.967
- But you love Mike so much.

1279
01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.700
- With every iota of my being.

1280
01:01:22.834 --> 01:01:26.667
And I've wanted to marry him
since our third date.

1281
01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.200
And with all my indecision.

1282
01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:31.567
he's the only thing
I've ever been totally sure of.

1283
01:01:33.066 --> 01:01:34.900
Until now.

1284
01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.033
- Trace. it's okay if you
don't wanna get married.

1285
01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:45.166
The prewedding jitters
are normal.

1286
01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:48.033
Every couple I work with has
some version of cold feet.

1287
01:01:48.166 --> 01:01:50.400
- Really?
- Yeah. of course.

1288
01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.333
- Hi!
Sorry I'm late.

1289
01:01:54.467 --> 01:01:56.433
Um. I will come back.

1290
01:01:56.567 --> 01:01:57.934
- No. it's fine.

1291
01:01:58.066 --> 01:01:59.166
I should get back
to wedding prep.

1292
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.567
- Hey!
Are you sure?

1293
01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.600
- Yeah.

1294
01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:08.734
- Um...
what can I help with?

1295
01:02:08.867 --> 01:02:13.400
- Uh. well. you can assist me
with the tables.

1296
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.066
Looks great.

1297
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.700
- Just trying to master

1298
01:02:20.834 --> 01:02:22.767
the lost art
of setting the table.

1299
01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.467
- [laughs]

1300
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.233
- This is awkward.
- So awkward.

1301
01:02:29.367 --> 01:02:32.600
- It's just the most awkward.

1302
01:02:32.734 --> 01:02:34.533
It doesn't have to be.

1303
01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:36.600
Look.

1304
01:02:40.033 --> 01:02:42.233
I know Cameron still
has feelings for you.

1305
01:02:42.367 --> 01:02:44.367
I was the one that
encouraged him to tell you.

1306
01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.066
- You did?

1307
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.767
- Honestly.
this was a concern of mine.

1308
01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.033
When we first started dating.

1309
01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:51.500
I wanted to take things
really slow

1310
01:02:51.633 --> 01:02:54.367
'cause I thought
he might not be over you.

1311
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.834
and I guess I was right.

1312
01:02:56.967 --> 01:03:01.233
- Well. maybe he is over me.
and this is just growing pains.

1313
01:03:01.367 --> 01:03:03.133
Maybe you two
are meant to be together.

1314
01:03:03.266 --> 01:03:06.300
- Or maybe we're friends
and got confused.

1315
01:03:06.433 --> 01:03:08.800
I-I don't know.

1316
01:03:08.934 --> 01:03:10.967
But at least
he's being honest about it.

1317
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.834
and that helps.

1318
01:03:12.967 --> 01:03:14.633
- You are so much
more mature than me.

1319
01:03:14.767 --> 01:03:16.567
[both laugh]

1320
01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.233
- Definitely not.
This is all for show.

1321
01:03:19.367 --> 01:03:22.767
But I know this situation
is complicated.

1322
01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.567
but Cameron is a friend.
and you're his friend.

1323
01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.266
so I'd really like to think

1324
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.934
that the two of us
could be friends too.

1325
01:03:28.066 --> 01:03:29.834
- I'd like that.

1326
01:03:29.967 --> 01:03:33.667
- And whatever happens.
"We'll always have Paris."

1327
01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.633
- "Casablanca"?
- Yeah. I love old movies.

1328
01:03:36.767 --> 01:03:39.133
- I do too.

1329
01:03:39.266 --> 01:03:41.767
"I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship."

1330
01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.667
[both laugh]

1331
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.934
- You've been
avoiding my calls.

1332
01:03:45.066 --> 01:03:46.266
- I'm sorry.

1333
01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.800
It's...
it's a lot to consider.

1334
01:03:49.934 --> 01:03:52.934
- I understand.
but we need an answer.

1335
01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.500
Jacques. I understand
your family has history here.

1336
01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:58.734
but just think
of the possibilities

1337
01:03:58.867 --> 01:04:00.633
if you were to sell.

1338
01:04:00.767 --> 01:04:03.266
Maybe it's time to let go.

1339
01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:08.300
- Hmm.
Let go.

1340
01:04:08.433 --> 01:04:10.166
Let go.

1341
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.834
So. you're finally taking
a much needed break.

1342
01:04:19.967 --> 01:04:21.400
- I wish.

1343
01:04:21.533 --> 01:04:23.400
Instead. I'm trying to write
the wedding ceremony.

1344
01:04:23.533 --> 01:04:26.000
but I don't know what to say.

1345
01:04:26.133 --> 01:04:27.700
Any ideas?

1346
01:04:27.834 --> 01:04:30.467
- Well. maybe you could
write something about love?

1347
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.367
- Good insight.
Thanks for the help.

1348
01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.867
[both laugh]

1349
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.967
- Well. maybe you could
say something

1350
01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.533
about fighting for love.

1351
01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:43.200
Fighting for your dreams.
never giving up.

1352
01:04:45.867 --> 01:04:48.734
- You're not selling?
[both laugh]

1353
01:04:48.867 --> 01:04:50.333
That's amazing!

1354
01:04:50.467 --> 01:04:52.533
- You know. I just--
I saw the chateau come alive

1355
01:04:52.667 --> 01:04:55.500
with the wedding preparations.
and it made me realize

1356
01:04:55.633 --> 01:04:58.400
I have plans
for this place for myself.

1357
01:04:58.533 --> 01:05:00.567
and I'm gonna take
your suggestion.

1358
01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.100
- And adopt a pack of dogs?
[both laugh]

1359
01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.633
- Maybe one day. but for now.

1360
01:05:05.767 --> 01:05:07.734
I'm gonna repurpose
the chateau.

1361
01:05:07.867 --> 01:05:11.266
I wanna make it into
a beautiful inn or event space.

1362
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.233
I know there are
a lot of event spaces.

1363
01:05:13.367 --> 01:05:15.367
but only a few
so close to Paris.

1364
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.066
- I know!
This is prime location.

1365
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.233
Ever since I set eyes
on the chateau.

1366
01:05:20.367 --> 01:05:22.867
all I could think was
"event space."

1367
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.433
And I have a million ideas.

1368
01:05:24.567 --> 01:05:25.867
and not just for weddings
and parties.

1369
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.734
but creating a space

1370
01:05:28.867 --> 01:05:30.867
that really brings
community together.

1371
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.233
- I love that.
I wanna hear all your ideas.

1372
01:05:33.367 --> 01:05:37.033
Maybe we could be
unofficial partners.

1373
01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:41.400
- I'd like that.
[laughs softly]

1374
01:05:41.533 --> 01:05:44.400
- Excuse me. Jacques.
We lost power.

1375
01:05:44.533 --> 01:05:47.133
- Oh. it happens.
It's probably the fuse box.

1376
01:05:47.266 --> 01:05:49.633
I'll show you.

1377
01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.367
[sighs]

1378
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.934
- You know. it's really
gracious of you

1379
01:05:56.066 --> 01:05:57.900
to host the wedding.

1380
01:05:58.033 --> 01:06:01.000
to do all this
for a total stranger.

1381
01:06:01.133 --> 01:06:03.433
- Well. Victoria is not
really a stranger.

1382
01:06:03.567 --> 01:06:05.133
- Yeah. of course not.

1383
01:06:05.266 --> 01:06:07.500
You two were pen pals. right?

1384
01:06:07.633 --> 01:06:10.033
- We were a little
more than that.

1385
01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:13.333
- Yeah. sure. of course.

1386
01:06:13.467 --> 01:06:16.333
Hey. I still even remember
my first kiss.

1387
01:06:16.467 --> 01:06:19.633
but you and Vic.
it's vacation romance.

1388
01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:24.433
Vic and I.
we have a life together.

1389
01:06:24.567 --> 01:06:26.600
- But you broke up with her.

1390
01:06:26.734 --> 01:06:29.300
- Yeah.
I made a mistake.

1391
01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.333
We need to talk.

1392
01:06:49.467 --> 01:06:51.100
Um...

1393
01:06:51.233 --> 01:06:54.166
I wanna give us another shot.

1394
01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.333
- I...

1395
01:06:56.467 --> 01:06:59.867
I don't know if I do.

1396
01:07:00.667 --> 01:07:03.600
- Vic. please.
don't give up on us.

1397
01:07:35.767 --> 01:07:38.300
[indistinct chatter]

1398
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.934
- Hi.
So good to see you both.

1399
01:08:14.066 --> 01:08:16.700
Let me fix that.

1400
01:08:18.066 --> 01:08:20.300
- [laughs]

1401
01:08:21.867 --> 01:08:24.233
- Okay. good.

1402
01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:27.000
Mm...

1403
01:08:27.133 --> 01:08:29.266
Three...

1404
01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.900
Excuse me. can we get some
more ice for the champagne?

1405
01:08:32.033 --> 01:08:34.200
Thank you.

1406
01:08:34.333 --> 01:08:36.100
- Vic!
- [gasps]

1407
01:08:36.233 --> 01:08:37.400
- Hey.
- You look amazing.

1408
01:08:37.533 --> 01:08:38.700
- You guys look great.

1409
01:08:38.834 --> 01:08:41.100
- Oh. stop.
- We know.

1410
01:08:41.233 --> 01:08:43.367
- Have you. uh--
have you seen Jacques?

1411
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.000
- I have not. not yet.
I mean. is he late?

1412
01:08:47.133 --> 01:08:48.734
- He's French.
He's always late.

1413
01:08:48.867 --> 01:08:50.200
[laughter]
- True.

1414
01:08:50.333 --> 01:08:52.000
Okay. I'm gonna grab
some appetizers.

1415
01:08:52.133 --> 01:08:53.166
- Oh. it's okay. sweetie.
I'll get them for you.

1416
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.066
- Hey. no. no. no. wait.
Thank you.

1417
01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.500
That is chivalrous.

1418
01:08:55.633 --> 01:08:57.033
but I can get it myself.
I know shrimp cocktail.

1419
01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:58.400
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1420
01:08:58.533 --> 01:09:00.166
Are you sure
you're allowed shrimp?

1421
01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:01.834
Because I'm pretty sure
the book said something about.

1422
01:09:01.967 --> 01:09:02.800
you know. the mercury--
- Okay. you know what--no. no.

1423
01:09:02.934 --> 01:09:03.934
Shh!
Sit.

1424
01:09:04.066 --> 01:09:05.266
- What?
- Yeah. right now.

1425
01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.734
- Are you okay?
- Well...

1426
01:09:07.867 --> 01:09:10.600
Okay.
Seth. I love you.

1427
01:09:10.734 --> 01:09:14.433
I love us. and you are my best
friend and the love of my life.

1428
01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:15.900
- I know.

1429
01:09:16.033 --> 01:09:17.633
- No. but ever since
I got pregnant.

1430
01:09:17.767 --> 01:09:19.600
I feel like
we're Mommy and Daddy.

1431
01:09:19.734 --> 01:09:21.433
- Well. yeah. we will
be Mommy and Daddy.

1432
01:09:21.567 --> 01:09:24.667
- Mm-hmm. yes. to our baby.
But to each other?

1433
01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:28.667
You know. we're still partners
and friends and us.

1434
01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.300
That is so special. babe.

1435
01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:33.433
I don't want it to change.
and I wanna protect it.

1436
01:09:35.633 --> 01:09:37.433
- Oh.
I'm sorry.

1437
01:09:37.567 --> 01:09:38.734
- No. you don't need
to be sorry.

1438
01:09:38.867 --> 01:09:41.166
Just be you.

1439
01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.633
And let us be us.

1440
01:09:43.767 --> 01:09:46.200
- God. I love you.

1441
01:09:47.367 --> 01:09:50.000
- Honey. you okay?
- Yeah!

1442
01:09:52.066 --> 01:09:54.567
I'm a little nervous
about tomorrow.

1443
01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.500
- You are?
- Aren't you?

1444
01:09:56.633 --> 01:09:59.967
- Nervous about marrying you?
Not in the slightest.

1445
01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.934
I've never been more certain
about anything in my life.

1446
01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.266
I thought we both
felt that way.

1447
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.266
- We do.

1448
01:10:11.433 --> 01:10:14.500
- Tracy. do you have cold feet?

1449
01:10:14.633 --> 01:10:18.000
- [sighs softly]
No.

1450
01:10:18.133 --> 01:10:21.767
I just wonder if...

1451
01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.633
what if this is
the wrong choice?

1452
01:10:24.767 --> 01:10:26.600
- That sounds a lot
like cold feet.

1453
01:10:26.734 --> 01:10:29.033
[glass clinking]

1454
01:10:32.433 --> 01:10:34.900
- Welcome. and thank you
for being here.

1455
01:10:35.033 --> 01:10:37.133
Now. as you all know Tracy.

1456
01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:39.834
you know that she can be
a tad indecisive.

1457
01:10:39.967 --> 01:10:43.233
but the one thing
that she always knew

1458
01:10:43.367 --> 01:10:45.834
is that Mike is the one.

1459
01:10:45.967 --> 01:10:49.433
Congratulations.
Tracy and Mike.

1460
01:10:49.567 --> 01:10:52.467
[applause]

1461
01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.000
[indistinct chatter]

1462
01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.467
- Hey.

1463
01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:03.734
Um. about yesterday.
I'm really sorry.

1464
01:11:03.867 --> 01:11:05.533
I guess I just care
a lot about you.

1465
01:11:05.667 --> 01:11:08.533
and I was confused.

1466
01:11:08.667 --> 01:11:09.967
and I guess a little jealous.

1467
01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.467
- No. I think
it's good it happened.

1468
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.900
We needed to know for sure. but
you were right the first time.

1469
01:11:15.033 --> 01:11:16.834
We don't have
a future together.

1470
01:11:16.967 --> 01:11:19.734
- At least not as a couple.
- Exactly.

1471
01:11:19.867 --> 01:11:22.834
And I think--I think that's
why it was so hard for me

1472
01:11:22.967 --> 01:11:25.567
to accept our breakup because.
you know.

1473
01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:28.467
you're such
a big part of my past.

1474
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.500
and I don't wanna lose you
from my life.

1475
01:11:30.633 --> 01:11:32.333
- I don't either.

1476
01:11:32.467 --> 01:11:35.367
- Also. I think you and Jen
are really great together.

1477
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.834
- Thanks. but I really
messed that up.

1478
01:11:37.967 --> 01:11:40.633
- Well. fix it.
[both laugh]

1479
01:11:40.767 --> 01:11:43.266
- Yeah. I'll work on it.

1480
01:11:50.533 --> 01:11:51.867
- I've been
calling and texting.

1481
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.900
What's going on?

1482
01:11:54.033 --> 01:11:55.967
- [sighs]
Victoria.

1483
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.200
I'm so glad that
we reconnected. really.

1484
01:11:59.333 --> 01:12:02.600
and I take full responsibility
for what happened here.

1485
01:12:02.734 --> 01:12:04.266
I do.

1486
01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.233
Because. you know. I knew that
you weren't over Cameron.

1487
01:12:07.367 --> 01:12:09.033
and I knew that

1488
01:12:09.166 --> 01:12:12.133
you didn't think
we were real the first time.

1489
01:12:12.266 --> 01:12:16.300
but I hope that this time
you feel differently.

1490
01:12:16.433 --> 01:12:18.266
- I do feel differently.

1491
01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.900
- Do you?

1492
01:12:21.033 --> 01:12:23.600
Or do you think
that you're just using me

1493
01:12:23.734 --> 01:12:26.300
to make Cameron jealous?

1494
01:12:26.433 --> 01:12:29.400
- Is--is that what
you really think?

1495
01:12:29.533 --> 01:12:31.100
- [sighs]

1496
01:12:31.233 --> 01:12:34.400
I think that--
I think that it feels

1497
01:12:34.533 --> 01:12:37.467
just like it did
the first time. you know?

1498
01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.367
Cameron appears.
and then I'm gone.

1499
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:43.567
- You ended things with me.

1500
01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:48.033
and now--
now you're doing it again.

1501
01:12:48.166 --> 01:12:49.900
And why?

1502
01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:53.800
Because I'm not
some teenage pen pal

1503
01:12:53.934 --> 01:12:57.567
or a flaneur
or adventure to chase.

1504
01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:01.467
but a real person.

1505
01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.000
Okay.

1506
01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:12.300
Now I remember the real reason
we broke up the first time.

1507
01:13:12.433 --> 01:13:14.900
- I...

1508
01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.333
I'll see you at the wedding.

1509
01:13:46.133 --> 01:13:48.300
- Honey.
Honey. there you are.

1510
01:13:48.433 --> 01:13:50.233
The hairstylist has been--
what--

1511
01:13:50.367 --> 01:13:53.500
Oh. honey.
What's going on?

1512
01:13:53.633 --> 01:13:56.333
- I messed things up with Mike.
I got in my head.

1513
01:13:56.467 --> 01:13:58.033
and now he thinks
he's just another thing

1514
01:13:58.166 --> 01:14:00.133
I can't make my mind up about.

1515
01:14:00.266 --> 01:14:02.233
- But is he?
- No!

1516
01:14:02.367 --> 01:14:03.734
I love him.

1517
01:14:03.867 --> 01:14:05.967
And what you said
in your toast was true.

1518
01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:10.533
He's the only thing
I've ever been sure about.

1519
01:14:10.667 --> 01:14:12.734
I just let my indecision
sabotage me again.

1520
01:14:12.867 --> 01:14:13.934
- Oh. honey.

1521
01:14:14.066 --> 01:14:16.934
Yes. you are indecisive.

1522
01:14:17.066 --> 01:14:19.734
but that's not necessarily
a bad thing.

1523
01:14:19.867 --> 01:14:23.900
because your indecision
allows you to not need a plan

1524
01:14:24.033 --> 01:14:26.700
and not be afraid
of the unknown.

1525
01:14:26.834 --> 01:14:29.133
It opens doors to possibilities

1526
01:14:29.266 --> 01:14:32.467
that other people
only dream about.

1527
01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:33.900
- Like marrying my soul mate

1528
01:14:34.033 --> 01:14:35.633
in the most romantic city
in the world?

1529
01:14:35.767 --> 01:14:38.133
- Yes!
Exactly.

1530
01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:40.133
So now you go get your man.

1531
01:14:40.266 --> 01:14:43.066
- Yeah.
- Go get your man.

1532
01:14:51.667 --> 01:14:54.266
- Mike.

1533
01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.133
I need to talk to you.

1534
01:14:56.266 --> 01:14:58.400
- I got dressed in case you
wanted to go through with it.

1535
01:14:58.533 --> 01:15:00.767
- Of course I wanna
go through with it.

1536
01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:03.166
And I'm sorry I momentarily
lost my mind.

1537
01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.367
With so much changing.
I didn't see the one thing

1538
01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:10.667
that will always stay the same:
my love for you.

1539
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.266
And I know I'm indecisive.
but there's one choice

1540
01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.166
that's easy to make.

1541
01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.133
that I'm so grateful

1542
01:15:17.266 --> 01:15:20.700
I get to choose
over and over every day.

1543
01:15:20.834 --> 01:15:24.367
the choice to love you.

1544
01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.200
- Well. I mean. look at me.

1545
01:15:28.333 --> 01:15:31.467
I don't give you
much of a choice.

1546
01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.767
Trace. I don't know
anything either.

1547
01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:37.033
but I know
I wanna not know with you.

1548
01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:39.967
- That was hard to follow.
but I love the gist.

1549
01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.533
[both laugh]

1550
01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:44.900
- Hey!
Save it for the wedding.

1551
01:15:54.433 --> 01:15:58.133
- Okay. and we are done.

1552
01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:04.200
- [laughs]
- Oh. you look beautiful.

1553
01:16:04.333 --> 01:16:06.333
[both laugh]

1554
01:16:06.467 --> 01:16:09.433
Now. it's time for the dress.
- Oh.

1555
01:16:09.567 --> 01:16:13.533
- So. we still have
this beautiful number.

1556
01:16:13.667 --> 01:16:18.233
but also a little gift from me.

1557
01:16:18.367 --> 01:16:20.266
- What?

1558
01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.533
Oh. it's the one
I fell in love with!

1559
01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:25.533
Thank you.

1560
01:16:25.667 --> 01:16:27.166
You're gonna make me choose
on my wedding day?

1561
01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:28.500
- I would never.

1562
01:16:28.633 --> 01:16:29.500
I was thinking
more of a costume change.

1563
01:16:29.633 --> 01:16:31.500
You can wear the original
for the ceremony.

1564
01:16:31.633 --> 01:16:33.000
and this one for the reception.

1565
01:16:33.133 --> 01:16:34.834
And do the "YMCA"
all night long.

1566
01:16:34.967 --> 01:16:36.433
- Yes!

1567
01:16:36.567 --> 01:16:38.233
- Oh. yeah. you are definitely

1568
01:16:38.367 --> 01:16:40.900
gonna be able to do some
good dance moves in this one.

1569
01:16:41.033 --> 01:16:44.400
- So this is why I brought
three pairs of heels.

1570
01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:47.166
- Yeah.

1571
01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.200
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1572
01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:51.300
Yeah. I'm great.

1573
01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:58.400
Guys. I'm fine.
[laughs]

1574
01:16:58.533 --> 01:17:01.800
Also kind of
completely crushed.

1575
01:17:01.934 --> 01:17:03.600
I fell for Jacques.

1576
01:17:03.734 --> 01:17:06.800
and as much as I didn't
want to admit it.

1577
01:17:06.934 --> 01:17:09.633
it felt real.

1578
01:17:09.767 --> 01:17:11.900
- Then why not try
and fight for him?

1579
01:17:12.033 --> 01:17:14.266
- Well. Jacques doesn't think
that love works that way.

1580
01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.934
and maybe it doesn't.

1581
01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:20.433
Maybe I should just be grateful
because spending time with him

1582
01:17:20.567 --> 01:17:24.567
reminded me of what
I always hoped love would be.

1583
01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:30.300
what I hoped life would be.
who I hoped I would be.

1584
01:17:30.433 --> 01:17:32.834
And despite being hurt.
I actually--

1585
01:17:32.967 --> 01:17:34.433
I feel like myself again.

1586
01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:39.500
I feel unlocked.

1587
01:17:42.266 --> 01:17:45.400
Uh. I-I gotta go.

1588
01:17:47.133 --> 01:17:48.333
- [laughs]

1589
01:17:48.467 --> 01:17:49.600
- I knew it.
- I know.

1590
01:17:49.734 --> 01:17:50.667
- I told you. I told you.
- I--you did.

1591
01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.333
- Hey.
Mom.

1592
01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:55.100
Sorry. I know it's super early
there. but I need your help.

1593
01:17:55.233 --> 01:17:57.800
There's a box of letters
probably in my old room

1594
01:17:57.934 --> 01:18:00.934
in the closet with the artwork.

1595
01:18:01.066 --> 01:18:03.967
I need a photo
of one of the letters.

1596
01:18:13.533 --> 01:18:16.533
Oh. it's not time yet.
Let's stay up here.

1597
01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.066
- Thank you for coming.

1598
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.767
- Well. I wasn't gonna miss
the cheese tower.

1599
01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:35.767
- [chuckles]
Yeah.

1600
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:38.667
Look. Jen. I am so sorry.

1601
01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.000
I got confused and made
a big mess of things.

1602
01:18:43.133 --> 01:18:44.533
- [laughs incredulously]
- But the one thing I know

1603
01:18:44.667 --> 01:18:46.667
for sure is how important
you are to me.

1604
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.000
and I don't wanna
lose your friendship.

1605
01:18:50.133 --> 01:18:51.900
- You haven't.

1606
01:18:52.033 --> 01:18:54.934
I'm still your friend.

1607
01:18:55.066 --> 01:18:58.266
So let's start there.
See what happens.

1608
01:20:16.633 --> 01:20:18.000
- Wow.

1609
01:20:18.133 --> 01:20:21.166
- [laughs. exhales]

1610
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.500
I want to be honest.

1611
01:20:22.633 --> 01:20:25.433
I really didn't know
what to say up here.

1612
01:20:25.567 --> 01:20:28.166
so I asked a friend for help.

1613
01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:32.567
and he said. "Talk about love."

1614
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:35.433
And I know that sounds obvious.
but then I wondered.

1615
01:20:35.567 --> 01:20:38.166
"Well. what is love?"

1616
01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.600
And then I remembered
a letter someone wrote me

1617
01:20:40.734 --> 01:20:43.667
a very long time ago
that answers that question.

1618
01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:47.133
and I'm paraphrasing because
he was 18 when he wrote it.

1619
01:20:47.266 --> 01:20:49.100
and English is
his second language.

1620
01:20:49.233 --> 01:20:51.300
[faint laughter]

1621
01:20:51.433 --> 01:20:54.266
[tender music]

1622
01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:59.567
âª âª

1623
01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:02.533
What is love?

1624
01:21:02.667 --> 01:21:05.467
We're often told it's
an interlocking of two souls.

1625
01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.367
but no. love is not a locking.
but rather an embracing.

1626
01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:15.467
an embracing of dreams
and hopes and fears and hurts.

1627
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.500
an embracing of both what is
and what could be.

1628
01:21:19.633 --> 01:21:21.734
what love could be.

1629
01:21:21.867 --> 01:21:25.667
what life could be.
what we could be.

1630
01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:30.633
We sometimes ask
what is the key to love?

1631
01:21:30.767 --> 01:21:33.700
Well. the bad news
is there is no key.

1632
01:21:33.834 --> 01:21:37.400
The good news is.
it isn't locked.

1633
01:21:40.367 --> 01:21:44.033
And that's what I see
when I look at the two of you.

1634
01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:49.133
A love of open hearts
and open minds and open eyes.

1635
01:21:49.266 --> 01:21:53.500
a love that inspires you
to believe in fantastic things.

1636
01:21:53.633 --> 01:21:57.533
a love worth growing for.
worth working for.

1637
01:21:57.667 --> 01:21:59.700
worth fighting for.

1638
01:22:04.734 --> 01:22:08.066
And with that...

1639
01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:11.967
Mike. do you take Tracy
to be your wife?

1640
01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.734
- You know I do.

1641
01:22:13.867 --> 01:22:15.600
- [laughs]

1642
01:22:15.734 --> 01:22:19.066
- And. Tracy. do you take Mike
to be your husband?

1643
01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.734
- I do.

1644
01:22:20.867 --> 01:22:24.367
- Well. I now pronounce
you husband and wi--

1645
01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:27.333
[cheers and applause]

1646
01:22:44.567 --> 01:22:47.433
[indistinct chatter]

1647
01:22:48.667 --> 01:22:50.133
- I swear.
next time I will

1648
01:22:50.266 --> 01:22:51.867
come on the walking
architecture tour.

1649
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.800
- You will?
- Okay. I promise.

1650
01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:00.333
- âª I sent you a letter âª

1651
01:23:00.467 --> 01:23:05.100
âª A telegram too âª

1652
01:23:05.233 --> 01:23:09.000
âª Answer your phone. baby âª

1653
01:23:09.133 --> 01:23:13.033
âª I need to talk to you âª

1654
01:23:13.166 --> 01:23:16.934
âª We can't go on âª

1655
01:23:17.066 --> 01:23:22.433
âª With me just loving you âª

1656
01:23:22.567 --> 01:23:25.600
âª Open your mirrors. baby âª

1657
01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:29.867
âª That's my last letter
to you âª

1658
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.033
âª I need no picture âª

1659
01:23:34.166 --> 01:23:39.533
âª To remind me of you âª

1660
01:23:39.667 --> 01:23:42.567
- That was
a beautiful ceremony.

1661
01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:46.266
I'm sorry.

1662
01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.934
I was wrong.

1663
01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:53.533
I thought that if you love
something. you set it free.

1664
01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:57.667
And now I see you
can set it free

1665
01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:01.333
and hold it close
at the same time.

1666
01:24:01.467 --> 01:24:03.533
and I want to do that.

1667
01:24:03.667 --> 01:24:06.100
I don't want to give up.

1668
01:24:06.233 --> 01:24:09.100
I want to fight.

1669
01:24:09.233 --> 01:24:11.667
- Hopefully for me.
and not with me.

1670
01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.000
- But I'm here.
and you're there.

1671
01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:17.867
How does this work?

1672
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.533
- I'm not sure.

1673
01:24:19.667 --> 01:24:24.900
But I know the way
I feel about you is real.

1674
01:24:25.033 --> 01:24:27.100
It was always real.

1675
01:24:27.233 --> 01:24:29.367
And I don't know
what I'm doing.

1676
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.900
or what we're doing.
or what we are.

1677
01:24:32.033 --> 01:24:36.567
or what our final destination
will be.

1678
01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.734
but I wanna wander with you.

1679
01:24:38.867 --> 01:24:40.567
[laughs softly]

1680
01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:43.500
And if my impassioned
speech didn't convince you.

1681
01:24:43.633 --> 01:24:47.266
then think of all the money
we'd save on stamps.

1682
01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:51.000
- âª Oh. and when all these
wonderful moments âª

1683
01:24:51.133 --> 01:24:54.834
âª That I have spent here
with you âª

1684
01:24:54.967 --> 01:24:56.734
âª Oh âª

1685
01:24:56.867 --> 01:25:00.500
âª I swallowed up my pride âª

1686
01:25:00.633 --> 01:25:02.333
âª And I beg. I beg âª

1687
01:25:02.467 --> 01:25:05.133
âª I beg of you. oh. baby âª

1688
01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:07.100
- Tu me manques.

1689
01:25:07.233 --> 01:25:09.333
- Not anymore.

1690
01:25:09.467 --> 01:25:11.333
- âª These changes
you're putting me through âª

1691
01:25:11.467 --> 01:25:14.300
[romantic retro music]

1692
01:25:14.433 --> 01:25:21.333
âª âª
