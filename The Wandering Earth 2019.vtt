the engine's operating system...

1555
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:18.005
I can blast the beam much higher!

1556
01:19:21.338 --> 01:19:25.546
Wang Lei. Jupiter's combustion shockwave
can propel Earth out from Jupiter.

1557
01:19:27.338 --> 01:19:28.463
Yes. I'm listening.

1558
01:19:29.088 --> 01:19:29.921
No need to yell.

1559
01:19:30.005 --> 01:19:32.755
Come on. Let's light up Jupiter!

1560
01:19:35.005 --> 01:19:37.213
[Zi] That's a suicide mission.

1561
01:19:37.921 --> 01:19:40.546
[Lei] Yes. but it's much better
than waiting to die.

1562

We only have 30 minutes left.

1575
01:20:37.255 --> 01:20:38.838
This mission has three steps.

1576
01:20:38.921 --> 01:20:41.046
[Yiyi] Step one. Shut the engine down
to gain control.

1578
01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:44.338
[Yiyi] There's seven nozzles
in an Earth Engine.

1579
01:20:44.421 --> 01:20:48.005
I'll shut down the engine temporarily
and direct all energy into one nozzle

1580
01:20:48.088 --> 01:20:50.713
to generate a plasma beam
that would reach high enough.

1581

Does anyone recall
the <i>12 Chimes of Spring</i> festival?

1582
01:20:55.255 --> 01:20:56.171

-Boring. I know.

1586
01:21:02.921 --> 01:21:05.171
I'll use it to override the system
so we can have control.

1587
01:21:05.463 --> 01:21:07.671
Step two. Once we override the system.

1588
01:21:07.755 --> 01:21:11.088
the auto-unlock mechanism won't work.
So. it has to be unlocked manually.

1594

70.000 kilometers into space

1598
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.838
and light up Jupiter.

1599
01:21:33.921 --> 01:21:36.421

the atmospheric transference.

Liu Qi. you'll drive the Lighter Core
to the reaction chamber.

1602

Installation procedure. uh...

1603
01:21:43.671 --> 01:21:44.796
is basically automatic.

[He] Are you kidding?

1607
01:21:50.546 --> 01:21:53.463
Installing a Lighter Core
requires a minimum of 13 months training.
