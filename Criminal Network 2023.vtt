3
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:04.646
It's time to go.

4
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.225
Okay. Constable.
I'll take it from here.

5
00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:31.271
You've been busy. James.
these last 48 hours.

6
00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:32.968
We've been watching you.

7
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:34.839
Who are you? The police?

8
00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:36.276
Would you prefer
to speak with them?

9
00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:39.583
I'm sure Scotland Yard
will be more than willing

10
00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:40.889
to accommodate you.

11
00:04:42.107 --> 00:04:45.110
Well then.
I suppose you are stuck with us.

12
00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:46.329
I wanna see him.

13
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.029
The emergency services
were too late.

14
00:04:51.073 --> 00:04:53.205
Ryan is no longer with us.

15
00:04:55.512 --> 00:04:57.035
He was too far gone
when we arrived.

16
00:05:02.693 --> 00:05:04.739
Please take all the time
you need.

17
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.483
but we do need to know
everything that happened

18
00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:11.223
from the beginning.

19
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:16.359
Well. I guess it all
goes back to two years ago.

20
00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:34.029
This past year
has been great. Ryan. huh?

21
00:05:35.204 --> 00:05:37.946
Safe to say. you've restored
my faith in teaching.

22
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:42.080
You remind me
a lot of myself. really.

23
00:05:42.124 --> 00:05:43.517
We're the same. you and me.

24
00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:46.737
You like to play.
and you play to win.

25
00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:49.827
That's all there is. you know.

26
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:52.395
That's what business is. really.
It's a game.

27
00:05:56.617 --> 00:05:58.836
Too bad a degree won't help me.

28
00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:08.411
You can't rely on yourself
more than a degree. Ryan.

29
00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:12.154
I mean. your grades are the best
I've seen in a long time.

30
00:06:14.678 --> 00:06:18.682
And you've made so much
more money. so I hear.

31
00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.513
Don't believe
everything you hear.

32
00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:34.611
Well. there's so much more
I would like to offer you.

33
00:06:39.268 --> 00:06:40.791
I would like
to make you an offer.

34
00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:44.578
You get your degree.
and in two years.

35
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:47.015
I'd like to offer you
a special internship

36
00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:48.756
in one of my businesses.

37
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.368
First. get your degree.

38
00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.110
And then. we'll see
how we get on together.

39
00:06:56.198 --> 00:06:57.417
What do you say?

40
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.945
No.

41
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.038
Last investment I made
fell through.

42
00:07:12.823 --> 00:07:14.259
I lost everything.

43
00:07:18.263 --> 00:07:20.178
Can't afford
the tuition fees anymore.

44
00:07:20.222 --> 00:07:22.616
so I'm no longer a student here.

45
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.577
Goodbye. Professor.

46
00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:32.147
Ryan.

47
00:07:33.627 --> 00:07:35.106
Ryan!

48
00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:30.901
So. how did it go then?

49
00:08:51.618 --> 00:08:53.097
Oh. man.

50
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.405
How did you lose it all
overnight?

51
00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:04.631
What are you gonna do now?
Are you gonna get a loan?

52
00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:18.775
"We regret to inform you

53
00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:21.473
your loan application
has been denied."

54
00:09:23.171 --> 00:09:25.216
Have you got any friends
that can lend you the money?

55
00:09:26.087 --> 00:09:28.393
You are the closest thing
I've got to a friend.

56
00:09:28.437 --> 00:09:29.656
and I don't even like you.

57
00:09:32.746 --> 00:09:34.704
Well. there's gotta be
something you can do.

58
00:09:34.748 --> 00:09:36.053
What about Professor Simmons?

59
00:09:36.097 --> 00:09:37.533
No chance.

60
00:09:39.491 --> 00:09:42.059
All available funding
has already been taken.

61
00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:47.238
No one can help me.

62
00:10:32.719 --> 00:10:34.459
You're late.

63
00:10:34.503 --> 00:10:36.679
Doesn't look like I've
missed much. Where is he?

64
00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:38.507
He won't be coming today.

65
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.683
In that case. you can
tell him we'll reschedule.

66
00:10:40.727 --> 00:10:42.598
And next time.
please don't waste my time.

67
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.861
You said you wanted out.

68
00:10:44.905 --> 00:10:47.429
-He'd like to buy it from you.
-Seriously?

69
00:10:47.472 --> 00:10:49.083
This isn't another one of
his stupid jokes

70
00:10:49.126 --> 00:10:51.215
-he likes to play. is it?
-No.

71
00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:54.044
You held up your end.
as you keep saying.

72
00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:56.525
So. he is willing to offer
a price.

73
00:10:56.568 --> 00:10:57.744
How much?

74
00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:00.964
Half the current market value.

75
00:11:01.008 --> 00:11:03.271
Half. Why would
I settle for half

76
00:11:03.314 --> 00:11:06.230
when I could get the full
amount selling it as a pub?

77
00:11:06.274 --> 00:11:08.450
You don't reckon
the price would be affected

78
00:11:08.493 --> 00:11:10.800
if people knew what this place
was used for?

79
00:11:10.844 --> 00:11:12.846
Don't even pretend
you'll let it slip

80
00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:14.848
because you'll be the ones
that end up in prison.

81
00:11:15.805 --> 00:11:18.155
Still playing
the innocent card. are we?

82
00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:20.331
You knew what this place
was to be used for.

83
00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:21.985
and yet you chose to ignore it.

84
00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:24.248
I didn't see anything.

85
00:11:24.292 --> 00:11:26.120
It's amazing
what people don't see

86
00:11:26.163 --> 00:11:28.209
-when there's money involved.
-Look. I'm not stupid.

87
00:11:28.252 --> 00:11:30.515
I know how much he's made here
and what he can afford.

88
00:11:31.212 --> 00:11:32.735
The vans that keep coming in

89
00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:34.389
in the early hours
of the morning?

90
00:11:34.998 --> 00:11:37.044
I didn't have to keep
this place closed. you know.

91
00:11:37.087 --> 00:11:38.219
You owe me.

92
00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:40.221
You're right.

93
00:11:40.264 --> 00:11:43.180
Without you. we wouldn't have
all what we have here today.

94
00:11:45.008 --> 00:11:47.445
So. you'll tell him
I want the full asking price.

95
00:11:48.098 --> 00:11:50.144
Otherwise. I'm selling
this place to someone else.

96
00:11:50.187 --> 00:11:52.537
and you guys can pack your bags.

97
00:12:05.289 --> 00:12:07.074
You know.
I've been thinking a lot lately

98
00:12:07.117 --> 00:12:11.600
about how I've changed.
especially since graduating.

99
00:12:13.428 --> 00:12:15.604
I thought I'd go on
to do great things. but...

100
00:12:19.347 --> 00:12:21.697
it's been two years
since I've seen my brother now.

101
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:24.744
Well. with how I left things.

102
00:12:26.397 --> 00:12:28.225
I don't know what
sort of trouble he's in.

103
00:12:28.878 --> 00:12:30.488
I wish I could take it back.

104
00:12:30.532 --> 00:12:32.534
I just didn't care at the time.

105
00:12:32.577 --> 00:12:34.579
I wanted to live my life
to the fullest.

106
00:12:35.842 --> 00:12:38.018
Just wish I could say sorry.

107
00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:40.063
But it doesn't look like
that's gonna happen. though.

108
00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:47.810
Anyway. time's up. Back to work.

109
00:12:47.854 --> 00:12:49.290
It's good talking to you.

110
00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:26.256
Got to admit. I was
surprised when you text me.

111
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.562
I thought--

112
00:14:27.605 --> 00:14:28.737
You thought what?

113
00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:30.739
I was expecting
the worst. you know?

114
00:14:33.089 --> 00:14:35.004
Well. you're not far wrong.

115
00:14:35.048 --> 00:14:36.832
Well. it's nice to know

116
00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:37.964
you're not laying in
the gutter somewhere. at least.

117
00:14:38.007 --> 00:14:39.617
Been there. done that.

118
00:14:39.661 --> 00:14:42.707
Ryan. come on.
Can't be that bad. surely.

119
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.102
So. you said something about
needing my help.

120
00:14:46.146 --> 00:14:48.017
-What was it?
-My job.

121
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.673
At the moment. I've been
doing it myself. but...

122
00:14:53.283 --> 00:14:57.026
things are... different. and...

123
00:14:58.506 --> 00:15:00.290
now I'm not too sure.

124
00:15:02.336 --> 00:15:04.338
Okay. Doing what?

125
00:15:04.381 --> 00:15:05.861
I can't really tell you.

126
00:15:07.994 --> 00:15:09.169
I'd have to show you.

127
00:15:09.212 --> 00:15:11.606
Whatever you need. Where is it?

128
00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:12.955
I don't know yet.

129
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.002
Okay. When is it?

130
00:15:16.872 --> 00:15:18.439
I don't know.

131
00:15:18.482 --> 00:15:19.831
You don't know much
about this job. do you?

132
00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:21.094
Are you sure you got a job?

133
00:15:21.137 --> 00:15:23.313
I have to wait for a text.

134
00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:26.882
It's all right. I was. uh.
I'm a bit short of money lately.

135
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.536
I was thinking maybe
I could stay at your place.

136
00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:33.933
I-- I could take the sofa.
if that's all right with you.

137
00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:37.632
-Whatever.
-Oh. yeah.

138
00:15:37.675 --> 00:15:39.982
And. uh. I didn't forget.

139
00:15:40.026 --> 00:15:41.766
I just didn't
know where to send it.

140
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.813
I got you. uh. a birthday
present for last week.

141
00:15:46.075 --> 00:15:50.297
Look. I called you here
because I need help with my job.

142
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.690
That's it.
I don't wanna know anything

143
00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:54.083
about your personal life.

144
00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:55.737
I don't wanna play
happy families.

145
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.173
And I certainly
don't want any piece of crap

146
00:15:57.217 --> 00:15:58.479
you managed to afford for a day

147
00:15:58.522 --> 00:15:59.959
that you
weren't even around for.

148
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:06.791
Why does he seem
to resent you so much?

149
00:16:07.792 --> 00:16:09.403
Well. a few years back.

150
00:16:09.446 --> 00:16:11.361
me and Ryan came into
some inheritance money.

151
00:16:13.015 --> 00:16:16.105
University seemed like
a good idea for the both of us.

152
00:16:17.237 --> 00:16:19.891
I paid for the fees up front.
But Ryan...

153
00:16:21.197 --> 00:16:22.851
he paid for
the fees in installments

154
00:16:22.894 --> 00:16:24.679
and invested his money.

155
00:16:24.722 --> 00:16:27.073
Seems awfully risky for someone
without any experience.

156
00:16:27.116 --> 00:16:29.031
Not entirely.

157
00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:30.902
I mean. he grew quite close
to one of the professors.

158
00:16:30.946 --> 00:16:37.039
They'd talk all the time.
play games. do puzzles.

159
00:16:37.083 --> 00:16:39.563
Ryan made a ton of money
with the professor.

160
00:16:39.607 --> 00:16:42.349
And so. you fell out
over Ryan's success?

161
00:16:43.306 --> 00:16:46.918
Not quite.
I borrowed some money from Ryan.

162
00:16:46.962 --> 00:16:48.616
where he had so much of it.

163
00:16:49.312 --> 00:16:51.575
I didn't think he'd noticed.

164
00:16:51.619 --> 00:16:54.361
but when his investments
fell through.

165
00:16:55.318 --> 00:16:59.757
he found out and he's
resented me for it ever since.

166
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.292
So. what's there
to do in London

167
00:17:12.335 --> 00:17:13.728
while we wait for this text?

168
00:17:13.771 --> 00:17:14.990
There's a natural history
museum.

169
00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:19.777
Uh. pass on the skeletons
if that's all right with you.

170
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:21.605
-while I'm eating my lunch.
-I don't know.

171
00:17:21.649 --> 00:17:24.478
I quite like looking at
the prehistoric human skulls.

172
00:17:24.521 --> 00:17:25.957
Hobby?

173
00:17:26.393 --> 00:17:28.090
Envy.

174
00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:30.440
Well. I wouldn't envy them
too much. They're dead.

175
00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:32.268
Yeah. But think
about how they died.

176
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:34.053
Not hooked up to machinery

177
00:17:34.096 --> 00:17:35.619
with the thought of death
lingering in their mind.

178
00:17:35.663 --> 00:17:37.752
No. they died in
the heat of conflict.

179
00:17:38.448 --> 00:17:40.189
Adrenaline rushing through
their body.

180
00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:46.543
I'll take that over
a hospital bed any day.

181
00:17:53.463 --> 00:17:55.291
Yeah. Don't get too excited.

182
00:17:55.335 --> 00:17:58.773
I only rent the top floor.
but there is a spare room.

183
00:19:28.906 --> 00:19:30.560
Are you sure
you got the right place?

184
00:19:32.083 --> 00:19:33.824
That's the point. I suppose.

185
00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.176
It's right where no one
would think to look.

186
00:19:38.438 --> 00:19:40.614
But we can't go in yet.
Not until everybody's left.

187
00:19:40.657 --> 00:19:42.659
So. how exactly
is this earning you money?

188
00:19:42.703 --> 00:19:44.183
We'll find out.

189
00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:45.314
Look. if you're
gonna steal something--

190
00:19:45.358 --> 00:19:47.186
I'm not stealing anything.

191
00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:48.404
Unlike you. I don't
take things that aren't mine.

192
00:19:48.448 --> 00:19:50.232
You're still bringing that up?

193
00:19:50.276 --> 00:19:51.755
If I still had that money.
I could've carried on.

194
00:19:51.799 --> 00:19:53.235
But then you would've lost
even more.

195
00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:55.194
So. that makes it yours.
does it?

196
00:19:55.237 --> 00:19:56.412
-Is that what you're saying?
-Well. no. I'm not saying that.

197
00:19:57.283 --> 00:19:58.806
I wouldn't have dropped out.

198
00:20:00.677 --> 00:20:01.896
That money
would've kept me going

199
00:20:01.939 --> 00:20:03.680
for at least another six months.

200
00:20:03.724 --> 00:20:05.639
Look. what do you want me to do?
I've said I'm sorry.

201
00:20:05.682 --> 00:20:07.684
Like. how many times
can I say I'm sorry?

202
00:20:07.728 --> 00:20:09.860
I've spent the money.
If I had it. I'd give it to you.

203
00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:11.732
What do you want me to do?

204
00:20:12.298 --> 00:20:13.777
Well. you can
start by keeping a lookout

205
00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:15.083
while I go in.

206
00:20:21.176 --> 00:20:23.874
Ryan. it's been two years.

207
00:20:25.398 --> 00:20:28.792
After all this time. I'm the
only person you can call?

208
00:20:29.706 --> 00:20:31.317
You're still isolating yourself.

209
00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:33.449
You got no friends.

210
00:20:33.493 --> 00:20:35.059
What are you. a psychiatrist?

211
00:20:39.455 --> 00:20:42.371
I had hoped something
would've changed. I suppose.

212
00:22:16.726 --> 00:22:18.206
I'm in.

213
00:22:18.249 --> 00:22:19.512
-What do you see?
-Tunnels.

214
00:22:20.164 --> 00:22:21.252
Tunnels?

215
00:22:33.308 --> 00:22:36.050
I'm going further in.
but I might lose the signal.

216
00:23:06.472 --> 00:23:08.387
Ryan? Ryan?
There's people coming.

217
00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:10.998
Just do what you need to do
and get out.

218
00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:12.216
They're the police.

219
00:24:46.572 --> 00:24:48.878
Ryan. just do what
you need to do and get out.

220
00:28:17.696 --> 00:28:19.088
Okay. you really need

221
00:28:19.132 --> 00:28:21.003
to start explaining
what's going on.

222
00:28:21.917 --> 00:28:23.702
What was all
that about back there?

223
00:28:23.745 --> 00:28:25.312
You wanted to be a part of this.

224
00:28:25.355 --> 00:28:27.488
I'm happy to help
in any which way I can.

225
00:28:27.531 --> 00:28:29.316
but I need to know
what's going on first.

226
00:28:32.362 --> 00:28:39.195
It all started a while back
when I was homeless.

227
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:48.683
I stayed in Central for a while.

228
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.080
'Til I was moved on.

229
00:29:11.445 --> 00:29:13.316
I ended up stealing a car.

230
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.796
They normally leave the keys

231
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.537
in the old ones
ready to be broken down.

232
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.713
so I didn't think anyone
would come looking for it.

233
00:30:57.943 --> 00:30:59.814
I decided to leave the car.

234
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.776
But then.
later that evening. I was found.

235
00:31:14.611 --> 00:31:16.831
I'm not sure who they were.

236
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:20.922
They took me to this place.
I don't know where it was.

237
00:31:34.936 --> 00:31:36.633
They gave me a phone.

238
00:31:37.983 --> 00:31:39.854
I was told to
await instructions.

239
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.725
and I'd be paid each time
I did a job

240
00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:44.380
with some big payout
coming out at the end.

241
00:31:47.035 --> 00:31:53.172
So. at nighttime. I'd wait
for a message and head out.

242
00:31:54.782 --> 00:31:57.916
It did involve just
taking photos of warehouses.

243
00:31:57.959 --> 00:32:02.572
but more recently.
drugs and guns.

244
00:32:04.444 --> 00:32:07.229
-All packaged.
-So. you don't have any names?

245
00:32:07.838 --> 00:32:09.231
No.

246
00:32:09.275 --> 00:32:11.016
Do you even know
who you're working for?

247
00:32:11.059 --> 00:32:14.889
All I get is these texts
from a man named Mr. Black.

248
00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:17.848
which I'm sure is a fake name.

249
00:32:18.327 --> 00:32:19.807
So. you don't have any names.

250
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.330
you don't know
who you are working for

251
00:32:21.374 --> 00:32:22.810
or what you're
getting yourself into?

252
00:32:23.245 --> 00:32:26.683
No. I don't need to know.
and I don't want to know.

253
00:32:30.296 --> 00:32:32.254
I'm never going back
to how it was.

254
00:32:34.561 --> 00:32:35.779
Never.

255
00:32:38.478 --> 00:32:41.263
Ryan. this is clearly
some sort of organized crime.

256
00:32:42.786 --> 00:32:44.832
I haven't done anything illegal.

257
00:32:44.875 --> 00:32:46.790
That's not gonna stop the
repercussions. though. is it?

258
00:32:46.834 --> 00:32:48.444
Look. if you are
not happy with this.

259
00:32:48.488 --> 00:32:49.880
by all means. I'll keep
your half of the money.

260
00:32:51.926 --> 00:32:53.623
So. decide right now.

261
00:32:54.581 --> 00:32:56.539
Do you want
to be a part of this?

262
00:32:57.845 --> 00:33:02.415
If you agree.
there's no turning back.

263
00:33:03.851 --> 00:33:05.461
Okay. Where to next?

264
00:33:14.296 --> 00:33:16.037
I don't
wanna seem ungrateful.

265
00:33:16.081 --> 00:33:17.908
but have you ever thought about
maybe moving away

266
00:33:17.952 --> 00:33:19.432
and trying something else?

267
00:33:21.129 --> 00:33:22.783
You think you can just move away

268
00:33:22.826 --> 00:33:24.219
from something like this?

269
00:33:25.351 --> 00:33:26.874
Well. I don't
think you've tried.

270
00:33:28.745 --> 00:33:30.312
And what would you have me do?

271
00:33:30.747 --> 00:33:32.271
Nine till five job?

272
00:33:32.314 --> 00:33:34.012
Three kids and a mortgage?
No. thanks.

273
00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:36.623
I'll take my chances here.

274
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.192
Looks like there's police
and security inside.

275
00:33:40.235 --> 00:33:42.063
Yeah. They must
be raiding the place.

276
00:33:43.456 --> 00:33:45.066
Or making a collection.

277
00:36:20.352 --> 00:36:22.702
Ryan. what are you doing?

278
00:36:32.277 --> 00:36:33.756
There was a girl inside.

279
00:36:34.496 --> 00:36:36.846
All right.
So did they see you?

280
00:36:37.847 --> 00:36:39.284
You don't understand.

281
00:36:42.591 --> 00:36:43.636
She was dead.

282
00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:48.336
Let's just--
let's just go.

283
00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.817
-I've got the photos.
-What?

284
00:36:51.296 --> 00:36:52.384
You're not serious.

285
00:36:57.084 --> 00:36:58.520
We can't do that.

286
00:36:58.564 --> 00:37:00.000
Ryan. we need
to phone the police.

287
00:37:00.043 --> 00:37:01.567
The police were already here.

288
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.222
If you wanna talk to them.
go ahead.

289
00:37:04.265 --> 00:37:05.397
We can try a different police.

290
00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.528
What good will that do?

291
00:37:07.964 --> 00:37:09.488
-Will it bring her back?
-Whoever done this.

292
00:37:09.531 --> 00:37:11.141
they need to be caught
and stopped.

293
00:37:11.185 --> 00:37:14.057
That's what we're doing.
We're stopping them.

294
00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:18.410
These photos.
someone wants them for a reason.

295
00:37:18.453 --> 00:37:19.933
You're crossing the line.

296
00:37:19.976 --> 00:37:21.151
We're not--
we're not doing this.

297
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.980
I already agreed to do this.

298
00:37:25.765 --> 00:37:28.594
If I don't--
if I don't do it. I--

299
00:37:30.204 --> 00:37:31.597
I don't know what they'll do.

300
00:37:37.516 --> 00:37:39.300
All I know is
they're powerful people.

301
00:37:39.344 --> 00:37:41.084
So what?
They're gonna come after us?

302
00:37:41.128 --> 00:37:42.825
So ditch that phone.
and they'll never find us.

303
00:37:42.869 --> 00:37:44.653
You wanna take that risk?

304
00:37:44.697 --> 00:37:46.438
They found me before.

305
00:37:47.134 --> 00:37:49.441
They knew my name.
my situation. everything.

306
00:37:50.398 --> 00:37:51.878
And that was
when I was homeless.

307
00:37:55.403 --> 00:37:59.755
I told you before.
there's no turning back.

308
00:38:04.673 --> 00:38:05.848
This is my job.

309
00:38:06.806 --> 00:38:08.938
I earn good money.
why should I give it up?

310
00:38:08.982 --> 00:38:12.420
Ryan. there's plenty
of other ways to earn money.

311
00:38:12.464 --> 00:38:15.075
No. That's all part of the lie.

312
00:38:16.381 --> 00:38:17.904
That you can have
anything you want in life.

313
00:38:17.947 --> 00:38:19.427
all you have to do is work hard.

314
00:38:22.125 --> 00:38:24.650
Well. I did everything I was
supposed to do. Everything.

315
00:38:26.129 --> 00:38:27.392
And it all failed.

316
00:38:29.742 --> 00:38:31.004
They lied.

317
00:38:33.267 --> 00:38:34.399
They lied to us.

318
00:38:37.837 --> 00:38:41.928
You tell me. You did everything
as you were supposed to.

319
00:38:42.189 --> 00:38:43.886
What has it got you so far?

320
00:38:47.107 --> 00:38:48.543
You brought me into this

321
00:38:48.587 --> 00:38:50.328
'cause you had
no one else to call.

322
00:38:52.112 --> 00:38:53.505
You're lonely.

323
00:39:03.297 --> 00:39:04.907
I'll phone the police
when we get back.

324
00:39:08.694 --> 00:39:10.391
-Wait. Oh. no!
-What?

325
00:39:10.435 --> 00:39:11.784
No. no. no. no. no. no. no!

326
00:39:11.827 --> 00:39:13.089
What have you forgot?

327
00:39:13.481 --> 00:39:15.004
My wallet.
I must have dropped it.

328
00:39:18.443 --> 00:39:19.792
Everything was in there.

329
00:39:21.968 --> 00:39:24.274
Not your ID? Oh.

330
00:39:24.753 --> 00:39:27.277
Yeah. everything.
My number. your number.

331
00:39:27.321 --> 00:39:29.105
I had it all written down.

332
00:39:29.149 --> 00:39:30.585
Why did you write it down?

333
00:39:30.629 --> 00:39:31.804
Because I don't like having

334
00:39:31.847 --> 00:39:32.631
that sort of stuff on my phone.

335
00:39:38.898 --> 00:39:41.857
Get away from me. James.
Get your own taxi back.

336
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:36.782
Stop here.

337
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.238
Hello.

338
00:41:49.594 --> 00:41:51.857
Who is this?

339
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.249
Oh. come on.

340
00:41:53.685 --> 00:41:56.514
Surely you haven't forgotten
your old professor.

341
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:02.520
Simmons.

342
00:42:07.612 --> 00:42:09.222
You were behind all of this?

343
00:42:09.265 --> 00:42:11.050
I am a man of business.

344
00:42:11.093 --> 00:42:13.748
Regardless of the industry.
I'm in to make money.

345
00:42:15.184 --> 00:42:17.143
You really do have no limits.

346
00:42:17.186 --> 00:42:20.973
You were one
of my best students.

347
00:42:21.016 --> 00:42:22.931
You could have
been part of all of this.

348
00:42:22.975 --> 00:42:26.021
As I said. we could
have gone far together. Ryan.

349
00:42:26.065 --> 00:42:29.155
But. no. No. you just left.
You took off.

350
00:42:29.198 --> 00:42:32.985
I lost everything. remember?
Your advice on investing.

351
00:42:33.028 --> 00:42:35.378
If you needed money.
then you could have come to me.

352
00:42:35.422 --> 00:42:36.771
I would've helped you.

353
00:42:37.206 --> 00:42:41.297
But. no. No. no. no.
You gave up in the world.

354
00:42:41.341 --> 00:42:42.864
You-- you-- It was too hard.

355
00:42:42.908 --> 00:42:45.258
You just decided
to take it and roll over.

356
00:42:45.301 --> 00:42:47.390
It was easier to have
your dreams taken away

357
00:42:47.434 --> 00:42:50.611
rather than to-- to actually
try risking yourself.

358
00:42:50.655 --> 00:42:53.266
Easier to blame somebody else.
am I right Ryan?

359
00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.838
Well. of course. you know
what I'm gonna have to do now.

360
00:43:00.882 --> 00:43:02.492
The same as
what you did to that girl?

361
00:43:02.536 --> 00:43:05.800
Oh. I'm not gonna kill you. yet.

362
00:43:06.453 --> 00:43:07.889
I'm gonna destroy you.

363
00:43:08.411 --> 00:43:12.285
But first. I think
we'll have one more little game.

364
00:43:13.416 --> 00:43:14.504
No. thank you.

365
00:43:15.201 --> 00:43:16.724
Ryan. if you end
this phone call.

366
00:43:16.768 --> 00:43:19.640
I swear you will regret the day

367
00:43:19.684 --> 00:43:22.425
you set foot
inside of my university.

368
00:43:25.864 --> 00:43:27.735
Goodbye. Professor.

369
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:50.149
-It's Simmons.
-Simmons?

370
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.325
-Simmons. who?
-Simmons. Simmons.

371
00:43:52.368 --> 00:43:54.196
As in. Professor Simmons.

372
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.763
He's the one behind all this.

373
00:43:55.807 --> 00:43:57.504
The drugs. the guns.
the distribution.

374
00:43:57.547 --> 00:43:58.679
it all belongs to him.

375
00:43:59.288 --> 00:44:01.247
That sounds like
too much of a coincidence.

376
00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:03.292
I don't think any of
this happened by a coincidence.

377
00:44:03.336 --> 00:44:05.991
He killed that girl.
A bullet in the head.

378
00:44:08.036 --> 00:44:10.648
My guess is she got
mixed up with him somehow and

379
00:44:10.691 --> 00:44:12.954
that's how she ended up.

380
00:44:12.998 --> 00:44:14.782
-We both need to leave.
-Okay.

381
00:44:14.826 --> 00:44:17.089
I won't stay in the flat
in case there's any problems.

382
00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.788
There's some things I need
to do. so give me a few hours

383
00:44:20.832 --> 00:44:23.617
and then meet me
at Camden Lock bridge

384
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:25.097
tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m.

385
00:44:28.143 --> 00:44:30.189
Just get out of London. James.

386
00:44:33.975 --> 00:44:35.063
Ryan?

387
00:44:57.825 --> 00:44:58.913
Hello?

388
00:45:01.307 --> 00:45:02.482
Hello. James.

389
00:45:03.788 --> 00:45:05.659
You. Where's Ryan?

390
00:45:06.747 --> 00:45:09.141
Well. I'd like to tell you
he's unharmed.

391
00:45:09.707 --> 00:45:11.534
But if you're a man
in my position can hardly

392
00:45:11.578 --> 00:45:13.232
let something like this go.

393
00:45:13.275 --> 00:45:16.191
So far. we've given
him a few drops of a--

394
00:45:16.496 --> 00:45:18.541
a potent immobilizing drug.

395
00:45:18.846 --> 00:45:21.675
Probably for the best
as he won't feel what's coming.

396
00:45:22.328 --> 00:45:24.373
Look. you--
you don't need to do this.

397
00:45:24.417 --> 00:45:26.027
-Please. just--
-Ryan didn't want

398
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:27.637
to play the game.

399
00:45:27.681 --> 00:45:29.814
so you're gonna have to fill in.
all right?

400
00:45:29.857 --> 00:45:31.293
Maybe save his life.

401
00:45:32.294 --> 00:45:34.340
You can talk to him if you like.

402
00:45:34.383 --> 00:45:36.298
'cause he can you can hear
everything you were saying.

403
00:45:36.342 --> 00:45:38.257
I mean. I would talk
to him if I-- if I were you.

404
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.563
this might be your last chance.
I'd-- I'd make the most of this.

405
00:45:40.607 --> 00:45:41.913
What do you want from me?

406
00:45:42.609 --> 00:45:44.263
I want to give you a chance.

407
00:45:45.177 --> 00:45:51.400
I mean. if you win. well.
you can. um. you can save Ryan.

408
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:57.363
Anyway. you better listen up.
John Wolfe Barry. 1894.

409
00:45:57.406 --> 00:45:58.886
That's your clue.

410
00:45:59.408 --> 00:46:02.237
A clue? A clue for what?
I don't understand.

411
00:46:02.281 --> 00:46:04.413
Jesus. Even Ryan
used to challenge me.

412
00:46:04.457 --> 00:46:07.286
I can see where the brain cells
went in your family.

413
00:46:07.329 --> 00:46:09.505
Okay. Okay. Please.
just give me a moment. okay?

414
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:10.637
Just give me a moment.

415
00:46:11.943 --> 00:46:13.074
Ryan.

416
00:46:13.945 --> 00:46:18.210
Ryan. if you can muster
the strength

417
00:46:18.253 --> 00:46:21.300
to answer
your brother's question.

418
00:46:21.343 --> 00:46:23.824
then. please. be my guest.

419
00:46:23.868 --> 00:46:25.870
Come on.
Your life depends on it.

420
00:46:28.394 --> 00:46:29.612
Ryan.

421
00:46:31.266 --> 00:46:33.791
I've got it.
He built Blackfriars Bridge.

422
00:46:34.487 --> 00:46:35.749
You cheated.

423
00:46:37.272 --> 00:46:39.057
So. is that--

424
00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.362
Well. I see
you've got about 42 minutes

425
00:46:40.406 --> 00:46:41.842
before the cab arrives

426
00:46:41.886 --> 00:46:43.626
on the bridge
to take you to Ryan.

427
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:46.978
But then if you are not
in the cab when it leaves.

428
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.154
a bullet will
go into Ryan's head.

429
00:46:50.546 --> 00:46:51.721
Well. I'm in Camden.

430
00:46:52.331 --> 00:46:54.159
Well. then I'd a get
move on if I were you.

431
00:46:54.768 --> 00:46:57.249
Oh. and James. I'll be watching.

432
00:47:40.814 --> 00:47:41.859
I can't do it.

433
00:47:43.469 --> 00:47:44.513
I'm not gonna make this.

434
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:46.907
I can't do it.

435
00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:49.257
Does it make you
feel sad. James.

436
00:47:49.301 --> 00:47:54.610
to see that you're such
a failure as an older brother?

437
00:47:54.654 --> 00:47:57.091
Does it make you
feel depressed that.

438
00:47:57.135 --> 00:47:58.876
despite being surrounded

439
00:47:58.919 --> 00:48:02.053
by thousands
and thousands of people.

440
00:48:02.096 --> 00:48:04.098
you've never been more alone?

441
00:48:06.796 --> 00:48:13.586
Listen. I am going to let you
earn an extra 30 minutes.

442
00:48:13.629 --> 00:48:16.110
I want you to walk
into Victoria Station.

443
00:48:16.154 --> 00:48:18.373
and I want you to say
at the top of your voice.

444
00:48:19.418 --> 00:48:22.595
"Attention. there is a bomb
in the building."

445
00:48:24.075 --> 00:48:25.163
You're insane.

446
00:48:25.206 --> 00:48:27.339
Clock's ticking. James.

447
00:48:27.382 --> 00:48:29.254
I'd a get a move on
if I were you.

448
00:48:36.914 --> 00:48:38.350
Are you sure about this. boss?

449
00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:40.308
It might be
even too much for us.

450
00:48:41.527 --> 00:48:44.008
We don't know who James and Ryan
have been talking to.

451
00:48:44.051 --> 00:48:45.792
We don't know who they work for.

452
00:48:46.358 --> 00:48:49.361
We have to discredit anything
they may have said.

453
00:48:49.839 --> 00:48:52.103
After that.
you can give the order.

454
00:49:04.245 --> 00:49:07.945
Attention! There is
a bomb in the building.

455
00:50:15.273 --> 00:50:16.317
He's done it.

456
00:50:17.449 --> 00:50:18.798
They've got
his name and picture.

457
00:50:40.472 --> 00:50:42.430
I'm here. I'm here. Where is he?

458
00:50:49.698 --> 00:50:51.091
My men can't see you.

459
00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.270
You said Blackfriars Bridge.

460
00:50:56.314 --> 00:50:59.230
No.
you said Blackfriars Bridge.

461
00:50:59.273 --> 00:51:00.579
I said you cheated.

462
00:51:00.622 --> 00:51:02.102
Oh. you were so close. James.

463
00:51:02.146 --> 00:51:03.756
You bastard.

464
00:51:03.799 --> 00:51:06.759
Listen.
by my watch you have--

465
00:51:06.802 --> 00:51:07.977
you've got about
10 minutes anyway.

466
00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:10.545
so perhaps another little clue.

467
00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:15.072
Um. it's 801 feet long
and 213 feet tall.

468
00:51:15.507 --> 00:51:16.856
The Tower Bridge.

469
00:51:18.162 --> 00:51:21.426
Ah. 9:50. James.

470
00:51:27.649 --> 00:51:30.261
How are you doing. Ryan?
You're still hanging in there?

471
00:51:30.304 --> 00:51:31.653
Drugs not wearing off?

472
00:51:33.133 --> 00:51:34.874
God. you must be
very disappointed

473
00:51:34.917 --> 00:51:37.616
at this feeble attempt
to save your life.

474
00:51:37.659 --> 00:51:39.270
You know. you mean
nothing to your brother.

475
00:51:39.313 --> 00:51:40.880
He's not even trying.

476
00:51:40.923 --> 00:51:44.318
I was more family to you
than he ever was.

477
00:51:44.362 --> 00:51:46.407
Ah. he must disappoint you.

478
00:51:49.976 --> 00:51:51.891
But then.
you burnt down my stores.

479
00:51:52.457 --> 00:51:53.632
Hmm.

480
00:51:54.937 --> 00:51:57.157
Did you think
I would let that go?

481
00:51:58.593 --> 00:52:02.119
I own this city.

482
00:52:02.162 --> 00:52:04.469
I own this city.

483
00:52:04.512 --> 00:52:07.733
I mean the public. they just
go about their everyday lives.

484
00:52:07.776 --> 00:52:09.648
They haven't got a clue
what's going on.

485
00:52:10.866 --> 00:52:12.781
They don't really understand.

486
00:52:12.825 --> 00:52:16.742
They're totally unaware
of what's really happening.

487
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:19.658
Unaware that I am king.

488
00:52:28.014 --> 00:52:29.842
Five.

489
00:52:29.885 --> 00:52:31.974
Ryan. Ryan. if you
can hear me. don't worry.

490
00:52:32.018 --> 00:52:33.541
-Four.
-I'm coming. mate.

491
00:52:33.585 --> 00:52:35.326
-I'm almost there.
-Three.

492
00:52:35.369 --> 00:52:37.676
-I'm almost there.
-Two.

493
00:52:39.852 --> 00:52:42.159
-I'm almost--
-One.

494
00:52:42.202 --> 00:52:44.596
Goodbye. James.

495
00:53:19.413 --> 00:53:21.328
All right. Calm down. sir.

496
00:53:21.633 --> 00:53:23.504
Right. Just take a moment.

497
00:53:23.548 --> 00:53:25.941
Take your breath and. uh.
would you care to sit down?

498
00:53:25.985 --> 00:53:27.508
Sit down?
I haven't got time for that.

499
00:53:27.552 --> 00:53:29.293
We need to get him now.

500
00:53:29.336 --> 00:53:32.034
All right. Okay. Let me just
take a few details.

501
00:53:32.078 --> 00:53:36.213
Uh. right. So what's your name
and your brother's name?

502
00:53:36.256 --> 00:53:38.824
-I'm James.
-James.

503
00:53:38.867 --> 00:53:39.955
My brother's name is Ryan.

504
00:53:40.478 --> 00:53:43.829
Ryan. Okay. Ryan.

505
00:53:44.177 --> 00:53:46.919
And. uh. where do you think
he might be now?

506
00:53:46.962 --> 00:53:48.529
I spoke to him 30 minutes ago.

507
00:53:48.573 --> 00:53:49.791
Can-- can you trace my phone?

508
00:53:51.184 --> 00:53:54.100
All right. When and where
did you last see him?

509
00:53:54.405 --> 00:53:58.278
-Soho Square.
-Soho. Okay. And. uh.

510
00:53:58.322 --> 00:54:01.455
who do you think
might have done this and. uh.

511
00:54:01.499 --> 00:54:03.457
where do you think
we might find them?

512
00:54:03.501 --> 00:54:05.546
A professor from the university.
His name is Professor Simmons.

513
00:54:05.894 --> 00:54:09.420
Professor Simmons. Okay.

514
00:54:09.811 --> 00:54:13.554
Just you wait right there. sir.
I need to radio this through.

515
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:33.564
-Ryan.
-Yeah. I'm okay.

516
00:56:35.043 --> 00:56:39.570
Simmons. he's-- he's turned all
of disused underground London

517
00:56:39.613 --> 00:56:42.224
-into some kind of network.
-A network?

518
00:56:42.268 --> 00:56:43.835
Yeah. Transportation.

519
00:56:43.878 --> 00:56:48.013
Any disused tunnel.
service track. railway.

520
00:56:48.056 --> 00:56:49.928
he's turned them all
into some sort

521
00:56:49.971 --> 00:56:52.931
of distribution network.
all connected.

522
00:56:53.888 --> 00:56:57.326
With The King's Head pub
right at the center.

523
00:56:58.893 --> 00:57:02.549
Ryan. you have to know I tried.

524
00:57:02.593 --> 00:57:05.073
I really.
really tried finding you.

525
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:07.641
Yeah.

526
00:57:09.121 --> 00:57:10.209
I know.

527
00:57:15.823 --> 00:57:17.346
Who would've thought
two years ago

528
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:18.696
that this is how it would go?

529
00:57:22.874 --> 00:57:26.225
I did my best. but it never
seems to be bloody good enough.

530
00:57:26.921 --> 00:57:28.009
Are you safe?

531
00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:33.319
If I can find my way
out of this place then... maybe.

532
00:57:34.799 --> 00:57:36.888
Come and meet me
before you do anything.

533
00:57:36.931 --> 00:57:39.325
There's police outside looking
for me and probably you too.

534
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:42.459
I'll call you when I'm ready.

535
00:57:44.156 --> 00:57:47.289
Ready? Why? What'd you need?

536
00:57:48.552 --> 00:57:49.770
The king's head.

537
01:01:09.404 --> 01:01:11.015
Nick.

538
01:01:11.058 --> 01:01:12.886
the boss needs you
in right away.

539
01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.714
I'll make a move now.
Where is he?

540
01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:16.673
Looks like
he's heading towards Soho.

541
01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.650
We don't know where
he's going yet. Nick.

542
01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.086
The units have lost him.

543
01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.348
He's heading back to
Soho Square.

544
01:01:41.132 --> 01:01:43.612
Be ready for me
and keep the public away.

545
01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:54.771
Well. you're
remarkably resilient.

546
01:02:56.294 --> 01:02:59.166
So what's this. huh? A truce?

547
01:03:01.995 --> 01:03:03.649
You take one more step

548
01:03:03.692 --> 01:03:04.911
and I'll have
your fucking head blown off.

549
01:03:11.352 --> 01:03:12.919
That girl...

550
01:03:14.747 --> 01:03:16.227
I found her body.

551
01:03:19.317 --> 01:03:20.927
Why did she have to die?

552
01:03:22.668 --> 01:03:24.278
What could
she possibly have done?

553
01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:28.674
It's just business. Ryan.
It's a game and she lost.

554
01:03:28.717 --> 01:03:31.242
I don't force anyone
to take part in this.

555
01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.113
People choose
to do it themselves.

556
01:03:33.157 --> 01:03:34.985
And-- and-- and then
they blame someone else

557
01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:36.464
when they don't
get their own way.

558
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:38.945
I don't remember signing up
for any of this.

559
01:03:38.989 --> 01:03:41.121
Oh. you-- you did

560
01:03:41.165 --> 01:03:43.907
when you burnt down my stores.
Who paid you?

561
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.604
Why would I tell you anything?

562
01:03:45.647 --> 01:03:47.562
You don't have to.
In fact. I think

563
01:03:47.606 --> 01:03:49.390
it's about time we ended this.
don't you?

564
01:03:49.782 --> 01:03:51.392
After all. I think we both know

565
01:03:51.436 --> 01:03:53.438
only one of us is gonna
walk out of here alive.

566
01:03:54.221 --> 01:03:56.093
So what do you say. Ryan?

567
01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:57.485
One last game?

568
01:03:58.443 --> 01:04:01.359
One bullet. six chambers?

569
01:04:01.402 --> 01:04:03.665
Or I could just take you down
to the station right now.

570
01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:08.235
You think you've beaten me.

571
01:04:08.801 --> 01:04:09.889
Well. you haven't.

572
01:04:11.195 --> 01:04:13.806
I have the best.
The justice system works for me.

573
01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.417
And I own this city. kid.

574
01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:21.814
Now. if you lock me up today.
I will be out next week

575
01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.729
and you better look
over your shoulder

576
01:04:23.772 --> 01:04:26.166
because I'll be coming for you
and your brother.

577
01:04:27.646 --> 01:04:31.911
Unless. of course.
we settle this now.

578
01:04:54.499 --> 01:04:55.674
It's time to go.

579
01:05:05.205 --> 01:05:06.946
Where is he now?

580
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:08.426
He was seen running past
Soho Square.

581
01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:10.689
Shit! He's not going
to Ryan's place.

582
01:05:10.732 --> 01:05:12.430
he's going
to The King's Head pub.

583
01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:14.301
Tell the boss to get out now.

584
01:05:30.578 --> 01:05:33.059
I've got eyes on him.
It's now or never.

585
01:05:33.842 --> 01:05:35.801
What's the boss say?

586
01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:37.846
We can't get a hold
of the boss right now.

587
01:05:43.287 --> 01:05:45.637
Under no circumstances
can James be arrested.

588
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.986
Gotta be taken out
before he can talk.

589
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:48.727
I know the route he's taking.

590
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:50.381
Meet me at Ramillies Place.

591
01:06:15.797 --> 01:06:17.756
We're holding the public back.

592
01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:19.366
You got five minutes before the
other units start turning up.

593
01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.934
You know the blind spots.
don't miss.

594
01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:27.157
-That's not gonna work.
-Ryan. what happened to you?

595
01:06:27.505 --> 01:06:29.942
The Ryan I knew was like me.

596
01:06:30.638 --> 01:06:34.425
You know. I-- I blame
those nine to five simpletons.

597
01:06:34.468 --> 01:06:36.035
You know.
they try and drag us down.

598
01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:38.211
Am I right. Ryan? No?

599
01:06:38.907 --> 01:06:39.996
Shut up.

600
01:06:41.388 --> 01:06:44.391
But tell me.
could you live with this?

601
01:06:45.392 --> 01:06:50.223
Wondering if
you could have been with me?

602
01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:52.269
Hmm?

603
01:06:53.444 --> 01:06:55.141
Do you remember
what I always told you?

604
01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.883
Do you remember?

605
01:06:59.276 --> 01:07:00.712
We're the same.

606
01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.935
We have to play
and we have to win.

607
01:07:09.068 --> 01:07:10.635
What do you say?

608
01:07:10.678 --> 01:07:13.942
Shall we find out
who's the better man?

609
01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.146
Got ya.

610
01:08:55.218 --> 01:09:00.353
One bullet. six chambers.

611
01:09:02.703 --> 01:09:04.009
One bullet.

612
01:09:08.753 --> 01:09:10.407
Six chambers.

613
01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.459
Oh no. you first.

614
01:09:20.634 --> 01:09:22.854
I'll take
whatever bullet you don't.

615
01:09:59.369 --> 01:10:01.371
One.

616
01:10:08.334 --> 01:10:09.596
Two.

617
01:10:15.602 --> 01:10:17.256
Three.

618
01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:25.090
Four.

619
01:10:30.138 --> 01:10:32.315
Five.

620
01:10:54.946 --> 01:10:57.340
Ah. you shot me.
you little prick!

621
01:10:58.776 --> 01:11:01.953
Oh. why didn't you just kill me?

622
01:11:02.388 --> 01:11:03.998
Goodbye. Professor.

623
01:11:11.745 --> 01:11:16.359
Ryan. I didn't teach you this.

624
01:11:46.389 --> 01:11:48.086
And that's all you know. is it?

625
01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:51.307
Were you expecting more?

626
01:11:52.482 --> 01:11:54.745
Should you divulge
any of the information

627
01:11:54.788 --> 01:11:56.790
I'm about to share with you;

628
01:11:56.834 --> 01:12:00.446
you'll be swiftly taken to the
UK's maximum security prison.

629
01:12:01.752 --> 01:12:06.844
Now. Professor Simmons
is the remnant of a dying breed.

630
01:12:06.887 --> 01:12:08.933
People like this we know about.

631
01:12:09.499 --> 01:12:12.328
But due to
his extensive criminal network.

632
01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:16.288
we've experienced difficulty
dealing with him.

633
01:12:16.549 --> 01:12:19.291
He has judges. police officers.

634
01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.337
even secret servicemen
under his control.

635
01:12:23.164 --> 01:12:26.429
Any attempt
to bring him down failed

636
01:12:26.472 --> 01:12:29.736
until he became involved
with a young woman.

637
01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.304
a woman.
unknown to the professor.

638
01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:35.394
the daughter of someone
of great importance.

639
01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:37.353
-So why didn't you do anything?
-We did.

640
01:12:38.049 --> 01:12:43.402
But we needed to know exactly
what we were dealing with

641
01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:47.232
in order to avoid
the legal ramifications

642
01:12:47.275 --> 01:12:49.060
of an official inquiry.
which would've given

643
01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:51.628
the professor
a distinct advantage.

644
01:12:51.671 --> 01:12:53.673
You paid Ryan.
You sent him the phone.

645
01:12:54.457 --> 01:12:58.112
We needed to find someone close
to him and Ryan was selected.

646
01:12:59.592 --> 01:13:02.508
Of course.
Ryan was unaware of any of this.

647
01:13:03.074 --> 01:13:06.773
But we did agree to pay over
a sum of money on completion.

648
01:13:06.817 --> 01:13:10.560
which I have no issues
on passing onto you.

649
01:13:20.091 --> 01:13:21.571
Very convenient for you.
wasn't it?

650
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:27.664
That Ryan's investment
just suddenly fell through

651
01:13:27.707 --> 01:13:29.013
right when he needed the money.

652
01:13:30.231 --> 01:13:33.104
If it hadn't.
he might still be alive.

653
01:13:33.583 --> 01:13:37.238
As I told you before. James.
we were too late for Ryan.
