Do you know how much it costs

96
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.014
to convert someone
to Christianity?

97
00:08:03.016 --> 00:08:06.351
Five hundred among the poor.
Ten dollars.

98
00:08:06.353 --> 00:08:08.553
Less. I think. if the convert
happens to be a leper.

99
00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.424
So?

100
00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:13.959
Sir. a missionary flies back
to the West

101
00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:15.994
and tells them
that he's converted 1000 people.

102
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.462
for which. of course.
he gets paid.

103
00:08:17.464 --> 00:08:20.966
but which is much more
than $10 per person.

104
00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:22.667
[chuckles] Good business.

105
00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.836
Yes. But the law here
in Orissa states that

106
00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.472
no person shall convert
or attempt to convert any person

107
00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:29.541
from one religious faith
to another.

108
00:08:29.543 --> 00:08:33.278
Yes. by use of force
or by inducement

109
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.580
or by any fraudulent means.

110
00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:41.486
Sir. and yet not one missionary
has been charged.

111
00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:45.290

708
00:55:18.449 --> 00:55:22.184

He's got no family.

709
00:55:22.186 --> 00:55:24.753
That's his karma.

710

You can call the leprosy karma.

711
00:55:27.491 --> 00:55:30.125
but the way we treat him...

712
00:55:30.127 --> 00:55:32.161
that's not his karma.

713
00:55:32.163 --> 00:55:35.130
People are afraid of the curse.

714
00:55:35.132 --> 00:55:38.367
So fear. unfounded fear...

715
00:55:39.837 --> 00:55:42.104
prevents the people
from doing good.

716
00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:47.676

719
00:55:56.721 --> 00:55:58.187

720
00:56:02.193 --> 00:56:05.227
My wife's in hospital.

721
00:56:05.229 --> 00:56:08.230
The doctors advise a transfer
to the city for surgery.

722
00:56:10.034 --> 00:56:12.034
We cannot afford to pay.

723
00:56:20.411 --> 00:56:23.579
What if I become a... Christian?

724
00:56:32.757 --> 00:56:34.923
That would be
a forced conversion.

725
00:56:37.995 --> 00:56:40.562
So fear...

726
00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:42.765

727

ten lepers once.

741

How many you think
came back to thank Him?

742
00:57:34.785 --> 00:57:37.586
- Not all?
- One.

743
00:57:37.588 --> 00:57:39.788
But he still healed them all.

744
00:57:41.559 --> 00:57:43.525
So will you help my wife?

745
00:57:47.765 --> 00:57:49.965
God's the one
that can really help.

746

747

I'm asking you.

748

you'll pay the hospital.

She's young. She'll be fine.

<i> Namaskar.</i> Mr. Manav Banerjee.

1065
01:32:36.718 --> 01:32:38.885
I was telling your wife

1066
01:32:38.887 --> 01:32:41.354
that you're writing an article
for us.

1070
01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:16.783
¶ You save any empty bottles
to put your teardrops in ¶

1071
01:34:16.785 --> 01:34:23.023
¶ Pleading your case to God
while He remains silent ¶

1072
01:34:24.292 --> 01:34:28.728
¶ He is listening ¶

1073
01:34:31.033 --> 01:34:38.004
¶ He's counting every tear
and hears when you pray ¶

1074
01:34:38.006 --> 01:34:43.076
¶ He'll answer in His time
so don't give up the faith ¶

1075
01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:49.449
¶ He knows what you need ¶

1076
01:34:49.451 --> 01:34:52.686
¶ Keep on pushing through ¶

1077
01:34:52.688 --> 01:34:56.222
¶ Even when you feel
your prayers ¶

1078
01:34:56.224 --> 01:35:01.027
¶ Are lost somewhere ¶

1079
01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:05.398
¶ Between here and heaven ¶

1080
01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:10.336
¶ Know God holds them all ¶

1081
01:35:10.338 --> 01:35:13.907
¶ Safely in His hands ¶

1082
01:35:13.909 --> 01:35:18.011
¶ He's got a plan ¶

1083
01:35:18.013 --> 01:35:21.815
¶ And they're not lost
somewhere ¶

1084
01:35:21.817 --> 01:35:28.788
¶ Between here and heaven ¶¶

Ah. Good morning.

"Staines Into Conversion."

"'New Orissa' Fabricates Facts.

1091
01:36:39.761 --> 01:36:42.462
Read it! You'll enjoy it
in your retirement.

1092
01:36:50.972 --> 01:36:52.372
Out!

1093
01:36:55.277 --> 01:36:57.877
<i> Manav: Yes. I gave Mishra</i>
<i> what he wanted to print...</i>

1094
01:36:59.781 --> 01:37:02.816
<i>but I could not leave it there.</i>

1095
01:37:02.818 --> 01:37:05.652
<i> I could not leave lies</i>
<i> about Staines on the page.</i>

1096
01:37:07.789 --> 01:37:10.190
<i> Since Mishra would not print</i>
<i> the truth...</i>

1097
01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.827
<i> I could provide that truth...</i>

1098

1100
01:37:33.114 --> 01:37:36.449
<i> I didn't know</i>
<i> if it would even be printed...</i>

1101
01:37:36.451 --> 01:37:39.786
<i> or what the consequence</i>
<i> might be...</i>

1102
01:37:39.788 --> 01:37:42.555
<i>but Shanti was with me on this.</i>

1103
01:37:42.557 --> 01:37:45.058
<i> She wanted me</i>
<i> to tell the truth.</i>

1104
01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:47.160
<i> no matter what.</i>

1105
01:37:47.162 --> 01:37:49.362
<i> Nobody knew that</i>
<i> what I had said at that night</i>

1108
01:37:54.636 --> 01:37:57.203
<i> And for that...</i>

1109
01:37:57.205 --> 01:37:59.372
<i> I needed to ask</i>
<i> for forgiveness.</i>

1110
01:37:59.374 --> 01:38:01.641
I'm so sorry.

1111
01:38:01.643 --> 01:38:06.145
I said things. I wrote things
that were not true.

1112
01:38:06.147 --> 01:38:07.580
What things?

1113
01:38:08.984 --> 01:38:10.583
About Graham.

1114
01:38:13.722 --> 01:38:15.722
Do you have children?

1115

A baby.

A daughter.

<i> Manav: The true story</i>
<i> about Graham Staines...</i>

1118
01:38:45.787 --> 01:38:48.354
<i> was very different</i>
<i> from what I'd first imagined.</i>

1119
01:38:50.525 --> 01:38:53.493
<i> I wondered what this place</i>

[instrumental music]

1121
01:39:41.076 --> 01:39:44.177
<i> Graham Staines</i>
<i> was a missionary</i>

01:39:44.179 --> 01:39:47.113
<i> by his own admission.</i>

1123
01:39:47.115 --> 01:39:51.317
<i> The question is not whether</i>
<i>he converted the others or not.</i>

1124
01:39:51.319 --> 01:39:54.620
<i> the question is</i>
<i> whether he converted others</i>

1125
01:39:54.622 --> 01:39:58.157
<i> by use of force. inducement.</i>
<i> or fraudulent means.</i>

1126

<i> For that. though I have</i>
<i> searched and searched.</i>

1127
01:40:03.365 --> 01:40:05.365
<i> I have found no evidence.</i>

1128
01:40:06.801 --> 01:40:08.301
<i> I have found. however.</i>

1129
01:40:08.303 --> 01:40:10.670
<i> that Staines was indeed</i>
<i> into conversion.</i>

1130
01:40:13.108 --> 01:40:16.342
<i> He pursued conversion</i>
<i> with outstanding success.</i>

1131
01:40:18.713 --> 01:40:20.980
<i> Through 35 years</i>

1134
01:40:27.389 --> 01:40:31.424
<i> He converted worthlessness</i>
<i> into significance.</i>

1135
01:40:33.328 --> 01:40:37.130
<i> He converted the hopeless</i>
<i> into the hope-filled.</i>
