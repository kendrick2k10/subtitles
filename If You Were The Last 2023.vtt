00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.452
Whoo! Ah.
[laughter]

183
00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.791
- There it is. There it is.

184
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.836
Go back. go back.

185
00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.921
- * Under cover lover. baby *

186
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.340
- Mm. Mm.

187
00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.092
Oh.
- Oh. we're turning.

188
00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.719
- Mm. Mm.

189
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.429
- So...

190
00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:41.099
I need to call
you out on something.

191
00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.101
- Okay.

192
00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.979
- I was walking through
the greenhouse this morning.

193
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:50.525
and I stepped
in some milky goop.

194
00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.571
- Oh. [laughs]
My bad.

195
00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.031
- Dude.
- What?

196
00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.157
I thought I cleaned it all up.

197
00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.743
- That's where our food grows.

198
00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.494
That's where the girls sleep.

199
00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:02.954
[chicken clucking]

200
00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.998
Oh. my God. were they...
[whispering] Watching you?

201
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.292
- They're chickens.

202
00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.585
- Ew.
- All right.

203
00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:09.961
That's enough slut shaming.

204
00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.296
- I am not shaming you.

205
00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.798
Masturbation is. like.
super healthy.

206
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.802
But I keep it in my room
because I'm not a dirty ho.

207
00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.888
- Dirty ho?

208
00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:26.436
Maybe we should do it.

209
00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:28.021
- Do what?

210
00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:29.314
- It.

211
00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:32.192
[soft music]

212
00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.361
- What?
- What?

213
00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.988
- [laughs]

214
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.406
- What? I'm serious.

215
00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:40.075
- Oh. man. He's lost it.

216
00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:43.661
- Look. in case
you haven't noticed.

217
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.747
we're doomed to spend the
rest of our miserable lives

218
00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:48.083
floating around on this ship.

219
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:50.043
So it would be crazy
for us not to bang. right?

220
00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:52.420
- Well. when you put it
like that.

221
00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.631
- [grunting]
So you're in?

222
00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:56.925
- No.
- Why not? [grunts]

223
00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.718
Look. first of all.

224
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.680
I don't need a reason
not to sleep with you.

225
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:05.141
I need a reason
to have sex with you.

226
00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.018
- Uh. floating through space.

227
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.395
Uh. boredom.

228
00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:09.854
The fact that.
other than Benson.

229
00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:12.065
I'm your only viable option.

230
00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:17.529
- See. I can think
of three excellent reasons

231
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.490
right off the top of my head
why we shouldn't.

232
00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:23.076
as you put it so romantically.
bang.

233
00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:24.369
Oh.
- Okay.

234
00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:27.539
Well. moment of clarification.

235
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.708
I'm not talking
about romance. okay?

236
00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:32.419
This is completely
void of emotion.

237
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.962
All right?

238
00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:37.215
This is all about us
using sex as a stress reliever.

239
00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.717
- Oh. no. I get it.

240
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.844
- Okay.
so what are your three great--

241
00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.721
- Ow! Oh.

242
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.055
Sorry. No. actually--
- Are you okay?

243
00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.515
- It's nothing. Yeah.

244
00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:46.891
What were you saying?
- What happened?

245
00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.978
- It's really--it's just
a little scratch.

246
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.062
Ah!

247
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:52.605
That's not a scratch.

248
00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:55.275
- It was just
the freaking tool cart.

249
00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:56.568
- Look. you need
some antibiotics.

250
00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.653
- No. we only have
one course left.

251
00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.072
I am not using it
on this little cut.

252
00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.866
- Well. what if
the infection spreads?

253
00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:04.617
- People don't die
from little cuts.

254
00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:06.161
- Yeah. because
they use antibiotics.

255
00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:07.704
- It's fine.

256
00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:15.462
[soft music]

257
00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.422
- So you were saying?

258
00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:18.923
- What?

259
00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:22.260
- You were saying why we
shouldn't do sex on each other.

260
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.970
- Oh.

261
00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:30.268
- Well. number one.
I'm not attracted to you.

262
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.437
- [laughs]

263
00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:35.440
That's an argument for.
not against.

264
00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:36.775
- How?

265
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.735
- Because if we were
attracted to each other.

266
00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:41.821
then "banging" could possibly
turn into something

267
00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:42.906
and it would get messy.

268
00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.199
- Super messy.
- Right.

269
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.950
So the fact that you're
not attracted to me

270
00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.161
is a benefit because
we don't have to worry

271
00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:49.662
about getting messy.

272
00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:50.872
Quick pinch.

273
00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:52.165
- Ow!

274
00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.503
So wait.

275
00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:59.172
You are not attracted
to me. either?

276
00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:00.799
- Absolutely not.

277
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.133
[scoffs]

278
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.885
- Okay.

279
00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:05.470
- Do you want me to be?
- No.

280
00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:08.181
Obviously. not.

281
00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:10.475
I'm just surprised
this is the first time

282
00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.603
us "banging"
has occurred to you.

283
00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:16.856
- I didn't say that.

284
00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:18.983
You've never thought about it?

285
00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:23.196
- I mean. you have the only
penis for a million miles.

286
00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.323
- See?

287
00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:27.283
There you go.

288
00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:32.789
So let's keep this
dry and clean.

289
00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:37.627
And if it starts to hurt.
you let me know ASAP.

290
00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.630
Okay?

291
00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:41.840
- Yep.

292
00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:48.471
So was this a debate. or are
you making a formal proposal?

293
00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:51.391
- Ah. it's a debate.

294
00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:52.434
- [laughs]

295
00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:53.685
- Unless I'm convincing you.

296
00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.186
then we definitely
should do it.

297
00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.024
- My point still stands.

298
00:14:59.065 --> 00:14:59.983
- How so?

299
00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:02.318
- Well. we're not
attracted now.

300
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.653
but if we started having sex.

301
00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:07.032
even if we just said
it was "banging."

302
00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.868
our hormones
would eventually take over

303
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.202
and we would
emotionally attach.

304
00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:14.372
- And when you say attach.
you mean fall in love?

305
00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.082
- Sure.

306
00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:18.668
That's the whole reason why
arranged marriages work.

307
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.378
Maybe you think
the other person's gross

308
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.881
when you meet them. but your
brain knows you're stuck.

309
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.382
Biology takes over.

310
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:25.967
- You're such a romantic.

311
00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.719
- Dude. it's science.
You are a scientist.

312
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:29.846
- Yeah. and as a scientist.
I can point out

313
00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:32.349
all sorts
of evolutionary benefits

314
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.142
to emotional connection.

315
00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:37.312
But that doesn't mean I think
love is a chemical reaction.

316
00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.481
No. not at all.

317
00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.066
People are meant
to be together.

318
00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.943
And it has nothing to do with
scent or a primal instinct

319
00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:49.032
or unavoidable circumstances.
it's just...

320
00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:53.286
I don't know. they just. like.
belong together. you know?

321
00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:57.374
- Oh. sorry.
Is this--is this on?

322
00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:58.583
Okay.
[clears throat]

323
00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.085
Lame.

324
00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.211
Can I get a lame?

325
00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:04.673
Uh. yes. because we are
all just robots.

326
00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.383
- Yeah. and by your logic.
it doesn't matter

327
00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:10.261
if we have sex or not.
because we're emotionally

328
00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:13.723
attached anyhow. because our
monkey brains will tell us

329
00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:15.433
that's our best chance
at survival.

330
00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:19.020
- Or one of us kills
the other to gain full control

331
00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:21.398
over our limited resources.

332
00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.319
- What's number two?

333
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.613
- Reason number two.

334
00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.031
We're both married.

335
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.869
[bell dings]

336
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.996
- Like I was saying. I don't
see what the problem is.

337
00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.207
- You don't think the fact
that we're both married

338
00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:41.251
should have an impact
on whether we sleep together?

339
00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.794
- I mean. granted.
I haven't read

340
00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.254
my marriage license in a while.

341
00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.923
but I'm sure
being adrift in space

342
00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:49.467
with no hope of rescue
gives you a hall pass.

343
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:53.346
- Okay. first of all. there's
not no possibility of rescue.

344
00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:56.975
- We literally talked
about this yesterday.

345
00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:59.644
- That was two weeks ago.

346
00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.730
- Really?
- Yeah.

347
00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.773
- Man. time out here
is whacked.

348
00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:06.317
- Look. maybe we don't
get saved.

349
00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.945
but I. for one.
still think we can fix this.

350
00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:11.239
- Ah. how's that
working out for you?

351
00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:12.782
- You know.
I'm so glad you asked.

352
00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:15.368
because it would be better
if someone helped.

353
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.537
- There are hundreds
of wires over there.

354
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.540
That means there's billions
of possible combinations.

355
00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.460
It's a waste of time.

356
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:26.171
- What else
am I supposed to be doing?

357
00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.675
Okay. You have a hall pass.

Tom and I have been
together since college

to each other.

you spend deployed or in space?

with anything?

00:28:02.182 --> 00:28:04.100
[sighs]

539
00:28:04.142 --> 00:28:07.145
You've gotta be
rational about it. you know?

540
00:28:07.187 --> 00:28:11.483
He's like my big brother
and my little sister.

541
00:28:11.524 --> 00:28:13.777
Yo. and he's kind
of like my dog.

542
00:28:15.111 --> 00:28:16.571
[laughs]
Am I really supposed to believe

543
00:28:16.613 --> 00:28:18.490
that he's not into this?

544
00:28:18.531 --> 00:28:20.450
Really? Come on.
[laughs]

545
00:28:20.492 --> 00:28:24.204
- And all these quote. unquote.
"reasons" she's throwing out

546
00:28:24.245 --> 00:28:26.998
is complete BS.

547
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.792
And even if we did
make it home.

548
00:28:28.833 --> 00:28:31.753
which we're not. by the way...

549
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.758
There's no way Savannah
wouldn't understand that.

550
00:28:40.053 --> 00:28:42.597
Yeah. I think
about it every day.

551
00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:44.140
- Work is good.

552
00:28:44.182 --> 00:28:46.059
Not to brag.
but I am kind of rocking

553
00:28:46.101 --> 00:28:47.477
this whole mayor thing.

554
00:28:47.519 --> 00:28:49.187
I got the funding for the
universal lunch program.

555
00:28:49.229 --> 00:28:51.398
so yay.

556
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.654
I don't like that
I'm living without you.

557
00:28:57.696 --> 00:28:59.030
but I'm proud of you.

558
00:28:59.072 --> 00:29:01.116
I'm proud of you.
and I'm proud of me.

559
00:29:03.243 --> 00:29:05.787
Oh. and I may have killed
that fern in the kitchen.

560
00:29:05.829 --> 00:29:08.373
so you should probably
get back

561
00:29:08.415 --> 00:29:09.624
because you're the only one

562
00:29:09.666 --> 00:29:12.252
with the green thumb
around here.

563
00:29:12.293 --> 00:29:14.087
Even the plants miss you.

564
00:29:16.715 --> 00:29:19.843
- I'd be devastated
if she waited for me.

565
00:29:21.928 --> 00:29:24.097
She deserves better than that.

566
00:29:29.102 --> 00:29:32.105
- Hi.
Hey. how's it going up there?

567
00:29:32.147 --> 00:29:35.525
Are you going nuts
on that tiny little shuttle?

568
00:29:35.567 --> 00:29:37.068
So many questions.

569
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.612
- Tom would love it up here.
[laughs]

570
00:29:39.654 --> 00:29:41.156
Are you kidding me?

571
00:29:41.197 --> 00:29:44.034
Sitting around watching
movies every night.

572
00:29:44.075 --> 00:29:46.161
it's like his heaven.

573
00:29:46.202 --> 00:29:50.915
I was always like.
let's go for a hike.

574
00:29:50.957 --> 00:29:54.294
let's try a new restaurant
or take a road trip.

575
00:29:54.336 --> 00:29:58.173
- I did screw up
the universal remote again.

576
00:29:58.214 --> 00:30:01.551
and now the sound
of the TV doesn't work.

577
00:30:01.593 --> 00:30:03.094
That's gonna have to wait.

578
00:30:03.136 --> 00:30:04.846
- I think he was hoping
this mission

579
00:30:04.888 --> 00:30:06.931
would be. like.
my ultimate adventure.

580
00:30:06.973 --> 00:30:12.479
and then I would come home
and finally be able to just...

581
00:30:14.272 --> 00:30:15.815
Be.

582
00:30:15.857 --> 00:30:18.943
- All right. I love you.
and I can't wait to see you.

583
00:30:18.985 --> 00:30:21.237
Have a blast.
[smooches]

584
00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:24.032
- End of message.

585
00:30:24.074 --> 00:30:26.826
- Hi.
How's it going up there?

586
00:30:26.868 --> 00:30:29.454
Are you going nuts

591
00:30:48.556 --> 00:30:49.724
Mmm.

592
00:30:55.271 --> 00:30:59.067
We add that to the list
of things I'll never do again.

593
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.829
- If he could see me now...
[laughs]

594
00:31:18.211 --> 00:31:19.170
Shut up.

595
00:31:21.172 --> 00:31:22.757
I need some music.

Adam!

607
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:16.394
- You hurt yourself?
- Um...

608
00:32:16.436 --> 00:32:17.562
it's just so weird.

609
00:32:17.604 --> 00:32:22.025
I can't--my music's
not working.

610
00:32:22.067 --> 00:32:22.984

- Oh. no.

614
00:32:41.461 --> 00:32:42.754
Don't say that. What?

615
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:48.885
- It says the root file
for your music is corrupted.

616
00:32:48.927 --> 00:32:50.220
- Okay. well. fix it.

617

I can't do this.
I can't do this.

And when I get back to Earth.
I'll be a billionaire.

- What?

697
00:36:44.371 --> 00:36:50.335
- THC and weed needs to be
heated in order to activate.

698

So you're gonna have to.
you know. like.

bake it or smoke it.

700
00:36:54.964 --> 00:36:59.678
Like. you can't just eat one
of these weeds and get stoned.

701
00:36:59.719 --> 00:37:01.680
But you know. maybe I'm wrong.

702
00:37:01.721 --> 00:37:06.643
Maybe you made the first
raw plant ever to get you high.

703
00:37:06.685 --> 00:37:08.561
Hey. it's still gonna be great.

- Yes. what is it?

709
00:37:18.238 --> 00:37:21.157
- No peeking!
- Jeez!

710
00:37:21.199 --> 00:37:23.284
- Okay. it's probably thicker
than the real thing

711
00:37:23.326 --> 00:37:26.162
and not as dry and crumbly.
but what do you think?

712
00:37:31.167 --> 00:37:32.711
- Are you serious?

713
00:37:32.752 --> 00:37:34.254
- Yeah.

* Dream of me? *

1078
01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:42.702
* *

1079
01:01:42.744 --> 01:01:45.080
* Please just listen *

1080
01:01:45.121 --> 01:01:47.332
* *

1081
01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:49.209
- We have one
that goes like this.

1082
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:51.002
[drill whirring]

1083
01:01:51.044 --> 01:01:52.420
Slower.

1084
01:01:52.462 --> 01:01:53.922
And it's erratic.

1085
01:01:53.963 --> 01:01:55.423
but that's what I like
about it.

1086
01:01:58.593 --> 01:01:59.719
You wanna try?

1087
01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:03.473
- Yeah. I'm fine.

1088
01:02:04.933 --> 01:02:06.893
- I'm fine.

1089
01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:08.436
I'm okay.

1090
01:02:10.063 --> 01:02:12.732
Just...
both: Just happy to be home.

1091
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:17.445
- Where is this guy?

1092
01:02:17.487 --> 01:02:19.656
They run out of ink?
- [laughs]

1093
01:02:19.698 --> 01:02:22.117
It's NASA. don't--don't they
have printers here?

1094
01:02:22.158 --> 01:02:23.410
Sign these papers.

1095
01:02:23.451 --> 01:02:25.078
- [flatly] Sign this paper.

1096
01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.373
[chuckles]
- It doesn't feel real.

1097
01:02:28.415 --> 01:02:30.375
- I'm here.
- I know.

1098
01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:32.210
- I'm so sorry.

1099
01:02:32.252 --> 01:02:34.254
We just need a few more
security guards out there

1100
01:02:34.295 --> 01:02:36.214
to help keep the press at bay.

1101
01:02:36.256 --> 01:02:39.134
- No worries.
- Not a problem.

1102
01:02:39.175 --> 01:02:42.387
I promise it's gonna
start feeling normal soon.

1103
01:02:42.429 --> 01:02:43.596
- Yeah.

1104
01:02:43.638 --> 01:02:45.807
- Oh. I'm so glad
we didn't miss you guys.

1105
01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:47.392
- Hey. guys.
- Hi.

1106
01:02:47.434 --> 01:02:48.893
It's so good to see you. Jane.

1107
01:02:48.935 --> 01:02:50.603
- You too. Savannah.
- Hi.

1108
01:02:50.645 --> 01:02:52.939
That farewell dinner
feels like a lifetime ago.

1109
01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:55.400
Oh. my God. yeah.
two lifetimes ago.

1110
01:02:55.442 --> 01:02:56.401
- I know.
- Hey.

1111
01:02:56.443 --> 01:02:57.527
Hey. How's it going?

1112
01:02:57.569 --> 01:02:58.903
- Thanks for taking care
of my girl.

1113
01:02:58.945 --> 01:03:00.280
- More like
she took care of me.

1114
01:03:00.321 --> 01:03:01.489
- [chuckles]

1115
01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:05.410
- I'm keeping the girls.

1116
01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:06.494
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1117
01:03:06.536 --> 01:03:07.746
- The girls?
- The hens.

1118
01:03:07.787 --> 01:03:09.789
That's what we call the hens.
- Oh.

1119
01:03:09.831 --> 01:03:12.125
- Unless you guys want some.

1120
01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:13.918
- Oh. um--
- Why not?

1121
01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.920
We've got the space.
- I don't know.

1122
01:03:15.962 --> 01:03:18.048
You know. if I deployed--
- Come on.

1123
01:03:18.089 --> 01:03:20.884
You guys are international
space heroes now.

1124
01:03:20.925 --> 01:03:22.594
Your deployment days
are behind you.

1125
01:03:22.635 --> 01:03:24.179
I mean. you're celebrities.
- Okay. okay.

1126
01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.680
It's just they make a mess.
- Wait. wait. wait.

1127
01:03:25.722 --> 01:03:27.891
How much of a mess
are we talking about here?

1128
01:03:27.932 --> 01:03:29.476
- Oh. no. they're great.
They're great.

1129
01:03:29.517 --> 01:03:31.144
I'm really glad
you're taking them.

1130
01:03:31.186 --> 01:03:35.607
I wanted to take Benson home.
but they said no. so--

1131
01:03:35.648 --> 01:03:37.233
- [chuckles]

1132
01:03:37.275 --> 01:03:39.903
- Okay. so your discharge
papers are ready now.

1133
01:03:39.944 --> 01:03:41.654
- All right.
- Hey. you know what?

1134
01:03:41.696 --> 01:03:42.906
Why don't Tom and I
handle this?

1135
01:03:42.947 --> 01:03:45.283
You guys just take a minute.
Say goodbye.

1136
01:03:45.325 --> 01:03:46.785
- Oh.
- Yeah. I got it.

1137
01:03:46.826 --> 01:03:48.286
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. yeah. of course.

1138
01:03:48.328 --> 01:03:49.871
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right.

1139
01:03:54.709 --> 01:03:56.294
- Ate a Pop-Tart this morning.

1140
01:03:56.336 --> 01:03:58.213
- Oh. yeah? How was it?

1141
01:03:58.254 --> 01:04:01.383
- Well. after your homemade
ones. I'm a little ruined.

1142
01:04:01.424 --> 01:04:04.135
Mm. well.
[both chuckle]

1143
01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:05.804
I'll get you the recipe.

1144
01:04:05.845 --> 01:04:08.181
All you need is a steady supply
of fresh.

1145
01:04:08.223 --> 01:04:10.850
unpasteurized goat's milk.

1146
01:04:12.769 --> 01:04:15.271
- So I'll hear from you.

1147
01:04:15.313 --> 01:04:16.940
- Yeah. of course.
I mean. we'll see each other.

1148
01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:18.149
We've got interviews
coming up--

1149
01:04:18.191 --> 01:04:19.150
- Not like that.

1150
01:04:19.192 --> 01:04:21.486
[pensive music]

1151
01:04:21.528 --> 01:04:23.321
Will you be a part of my life?

1152
01:04:23.363 --> 01:04:30.245
* *

1153
01:04:31.204 --> 01:04:32.956
- No.

1154
01:04:32.997 --> 01:04:35.375
- Come on.

1155
01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:38.962
Just a phone call
every now and then. you know?

1156
01:04:39.004 --> 01:04:41.006
Old friends
checking up on each other.

1157
01:04:41.047 --> 01:04:44.676
- Adam. we were stuck
in a box for three years.

1158
01:04:44.718 --> 01:04:47.512
and it messed with our heads.

1159
01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:48.888
And now we're out of that box.

1160
01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:52.767
This is real.

1161
01:04:52.809 --> 01:04:55.729
Up there. it wasn't real.

1162
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:59.357
- You ready?

1163
01:04:59.399 --> 01:05:02.027
Huh. Yeah.

1164
01:05:03.778 --> 01:05:07.490
So. well. bye.

1165
01:05:07.532 --> 01:05:09.617
- See you guys.
- Bye.

1166
01:05:09.659 --> 01:05:10.744
See you. Adam.

1167
01:05:13.496 --> 01:05:17.167
Discharged.
- Discharged.

1168
01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:23.006
- We're on in five. four.
three. two...

1169
01:05:23.048 --> 01:05:24.924
- Adam. the world
wants to know.

1170
01:05:24.966 --> 01:05:27.677
How did you survive in space?

1171
01:05:27.719 --> 01:05:29.012
- Well. that's
a loaded question.

1172
01:05:29.054 --> 01:05:30.597
- Yeah.

1173
01:05:30.638 --> 01:05:33.892
We basically had a living.
breathing ecosystem

1174
01:05:33.933 --> 01:05:35.894
on the ship. so we were able

1175
01:05:35.935 --> 01:05:37.395
to sustain our own food.

1176
01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:39.564
and the ship created oxygen.

1177
01:05:39.606 --> 01:05:42.484
And we. um.

1178
01:05:42.525 --> 01:05:44.319
we made our way through it.

1179
01:05:44.361 --> 01:05:46.863
- He was just circling
the grocery parking lot.

1180
01:05:46.905 --> 01:05:48.073
- Is this the
parking lot story again?

1181
01:05:48.114 --> 01:05:49.366
- Over and over.
- Come on.

1182
01:05:49.407 --> 01:05:51.743
- I wanna. like. close it.
There we go.

1183
01:05:55.455 --> 01:05:58.083
- So what have the two of you
been doing to reconnect.

1184
01:05:58.124 --> 01:06:00.627
I mean. after three years?

1185
01:06:00.669 --> 01:06:02.170
- Well. we've been trying
to make up

1186
01:06:02.212 --> 01:06:04.255
for lost time. you know?

1187
01:06:04.297 --> 01:06:11.262
* *

1188
01:06:14.015 --> 01:06:16.643
- And my wife's the governor.
- [chuckles]

1189
01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:19.312
- Yeah. so that's a little...
different.

1190
01:06:19.354 --> 01:06:21.022
- Yeah. you know what. Frank?
I don't wanna hear it.

1191
01:06:21.064 --> 01:06:23.191
This bill's gonna go through
with or without you.

1192
01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:25.527
So you can either choose to be
on the side of the poor kids

1193
01:06:25.568 --> 01:06:27.904
who wanna learn their colors
and their goddamn ABCs

1194
01:06:27.946 --> 01:06:30.407
or you can cast a losing vote
against equal access

1195
01:06:30.448 --> 01:06:33.284
to education and deal
with the voters in November.

1196
01:06:35.537 --> 01:06:37.122
Good choice. Frank.

1197
01:06:37.163 --> 01:06:38.665
Hi.
- You know. this isn't fair.

1198
01:06:38.707 --> 01:06:40.458
- What?
- I orbit Jupiter.

1199
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.128
I come home. and I'm still
a schlub in this relationship.

1200
01:06:43.169 --> 01:06:45.255
- Yeah. well. you're my schlub.

1201
01:06:45.296 --> 01:06:47.882
[phone rings]
- Uh. Governor.

1202
01:06:47.924 --> 01:06:51.052
[phone buzzing]

1203
01:07:01.396 --> 01:07:05.066
- You know. this one
is my favorite.

1204
01:07:07.485 --> 01:07:08.820
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1205
01:07:08.862 --> 01:07:11.156
- I thought you hated tattoos.

1206
01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:13.658
- Well. yeah.
normally I do. but...

1207
01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:16.911
all of these. they're like--

1208
01:07:16.953 --> 01:07:20.749
you know. like a map of your
grand adventure up there.

1209
01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:23.001
- I like that.

1210
01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:24.878
- I can just. boop. boop.

1211
01:07:24.919 --> 01:07:26.379
- [chuckles]

1212
01:07:26.421 --> 01:07:27.380
- Hello.

1213
01:07:30.842 --> 01:07:32.385
What was your favorite part?

1214
01:07:34.763 --> 01:07:37.515
- Um...

1215
01:07:37.557 --> 01:07:41.728
I guess the dancing.

1216
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:45.357
Adam made a surprisingly
good dance partner.

1217
01:07:45.398 --> 01:07:46.733
- [chuckles]

1218
01:07:48.568 --> 01:07:50.570
That's good.

1219
01:07:50.612 --> 01:07:54.199
I'm guessing the worst part
was losing Benson. right?

1220
01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.700
You know. I actually
never asked.

1221
01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:59.120
Who found her? Was it you?

1222
01:07:59.162 --> 01:08:00.538
- No.

1223
01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.457
Adam found her.
- Good.

1224
01:08:11.591 --> 01:08:14.094
- What do you think
about going on a trip?

1225
01:08:15.845 --> 01:08:17.972
- A trip?

1226
01:08:18.014 --> 01:08:21.726
- Yeah. Iceland.
to see the northern lights.

1227
01:08:21.768 --> 01:08:23.395
- Iceland. huh?

1228
01:08:23.436 --> 01:08:24.354
- Mm-hmm.

1229
01:08:26.898 --> 01:08:28.608
- Yeah. sure.

1230
01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:31.236
But. I mean. I--I--

1231
01:08:31.277 --> 01:08:32.946
it feels like
you just gone back

1232
01:08:32.987 --> 01:08:35.615
and you're ready
to leave again so soon?

1233
01:08:35.657 --> 01:08:37.909
- Oh. no. I just.

1234
01:08:37.951 --> 01:08:41.955
um. thought it would be
a nice way to reconnect.

1235
01:08:43.623 --> 01:08:46.418
- No. ah...

1236
01:08:46.459 --> 01:08:47.961
I'm sorry.

1237
01:08:50.463 --> 01:08:52.382
Look. of course
you wanna go on a trip.

1238
01:08:52.424 --> 01:08:57.053
I keep forgetting
that you were trapped

1239
01:08:57.095 --> 01:08:59.431
in a box
for the last three years.

1240
01:08:59.472 --> 01:09:01.141
Yeah.

1241
01:09:01.182 --> 01:09:05.061
We can go on a trip. anywhere
you want. just you and me.

1242

[Jimmy Lewis' "How Long Is a
Heartache Supposed to Last"]

1243
01:09:16.114 --> 01:09:22.328
- * To keep from crying.
I be talking... *

1244
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:24.831
- And how are you getting on
now that you're home?

1245
01:09:24.873 --> 01:09:27.000
- Um. very well. Thank you.

1246
01:09:27.042 --> 01:09:30.420
- I'd imagine the boredom
would be the worst bit.

1247
01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:32.964
- You know. we never really
experienced boredom.
