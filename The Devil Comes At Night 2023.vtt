Seriously. it's-it's
fine. we weren't close.

93
00:07:49.538 --> 00:07:50.470
He traveled a lot for
work.

94
00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:52.092
and I wasn't great at
keeping in touch.

95
00:07:52.817 --> 00:07:54.888
I didn't know he retired up
here till after he passed.

96
00:07:55.095 --> 00:07:59.548
Uh-huh. well. I'm sure Arthur
is happy you got the place.

you knew him.

101
00:08:05.864 --> 00:08:07.728

never met him.

102
00:08:08.557 --> 00:08:10.593
Yeah. it's-it's weird.

103
00:08:10.973 --> 00:08:11.767

meet a new neighbor.

109
00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:23.019
This is temporary.

110
00:08:23.054 --> 00:08:26.091
I'm just here to sort
through his things.

111
00:08:26.126 --> 00:08:27.679
settle his affairs.

112
00:08:27.714 --> 00:08:29.819
And soon as I'm done
I'm heading out.

113
00:08:29.854 --> 00:08:32.615
Can't be that bad being
back in your hometown?

114
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:36.550
I grew up with my mom;
it's my first time here.

115
00:08:36.585 --> 00:08:38.690
But your father. his
family was from here.

116
00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:40.036
I don't know. could be.

[Laughs] Lisa likes to
play town historian.

118
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:44.006
Well. why would his
father retire here

119
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.663
if he wasn't from here?

120
00:08:45.697 --> 00:08:47.837
Like I said. I wasn't great
at keeping in touch.

121
00:08:47.872 --> 00:08:49.114
Well. maybe we knew
your grandfather.

122
00:08:49.149 --> 00:08:50.081
What was his name?

123
00:08:50.115 --> 00:08:51.082
I never met him.

124
00:08:51.116 --> 00:08:52.773
Well. you know his name.

125
00:08:52.808 --> 00:08:54.016
Uh. Grandpa Rakes.

126
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.087
[Laughs] Uh. like
I said. I-I never met him.

127
00:08:56.121 --> 00:08:57.157
Think for a second.

128
00:08:59.815 --> 00:09:01.817
Too intense.
[laughs] sorry.

129
00:09:01.851 --> 00:09:03.991
I just get really excited
about history.

130
00:09:04.026 --> 00:09:05.959
[Laughs] It's all good. yeah;

131
00:09:05.993 --> 00:09:07.167
I wish you could tell me more.

132
00:09:08.202 --> 00:09:09.894
Uh. we need more beer.

133
00:09:09.928 --> 00:09:10.895
Yes.

134
00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:12.586
Uh. well. my father kept
some in the fridge.

135
00:09:12.621 --> 00:09:14.001

We're just to those trees.

139
00:09:31.018 --> 00:09:34.366
Full disclosure.
I don't drink.

140
00:09:34.953 --> 00:09:37.059
I shouldn't have let
you open this one.

141
00:09:37.922 --> 00:09:39.820
Uh. time to call it a night.

142
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.030
Sorry for the beers. uh.

143
00:09:43.065 --> 00:09:44.066

Tomorrow.

145
00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:49.071
What. our house isn't
good enough for you?

146
00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:51.211
What? No-no.
it's nothing like that.

147
00:09:51.245 --> 00:09:52.315
Hey. shut up. Ted.

148
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.180
Ben. just come. don't
leave me with this drunk.

149
00:09:55.767 --> 00:09:57.976
[Laughs] Come

150
00:09:58.149 --> 00:09:59.219
It's not a big deal.

151
00:10:00.289 --> 00:10:02.809
You know what. and nothing
personal. but. uh-uh

152
00:10:02.843 --> 00:10:05.052
I think we just call it
goodnight now.

153
00:10:07.158 --> 00:10:10.610
What. you afraid
of the dark. Ben?

154
00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:13.820
There's nothing out here.

155
00:10:16.477 --> 00:10:17.133
Okay.

Nothing out here.

157
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.831
He's right. there's
nothing to be scared of.

Look. uh. I got to hide.

182
00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:35.073
Jack. are you all right. Jack?

183
00:11:36.868 --> 00:11:37.766
Shit.

184
00:11:54.058 --> 00:11:56.025
Jack-Jack. are you there?

185
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.268
Yeah-yeah.
I -- I'm good for now.

186
00:11:57.302 --> 00:11:59.166
You lied to me.
you son of a bitch.

187
00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:00.754
Talk to me. Jack.

188
00:12:00.789 --> 00:12:02.825
I drove six hours
to come here.

189
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.999
you told me you were sober.

190
00:12:04.033 --> 00:12:05.828
promised me
you could handle this.

191
00:12:05.863 --> 00:12:08.935
I am sober. I swear.

192
00:12:09.245 --> 00:12:10.074
Yeah.

193
00:12:10.971 --> 00:12:12.559
Look. I was waiting for
you at the bar.

194
00:12:12.593 --> 00:12:18.185
I ordered dinner. and then
I can't remember.

195
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.980
Yeah. well. you were
hammered when I got there.

196
00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:21.119
That can't be.

197
00:12:21.154 --> 00:12:24.157
You were outta control.
fighting two racist hicks.

198
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:25.952
Now. you know what happens
with people like you in

199
00:12:25.986 --> 00:12:26.987
this kinda town.

200
00:12:28.092 --> 00:12:29.887
Well. you broke your hand
shattering a guy's jaw.

201
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:32.027
For Christ sake. I barely
got you out of the bar.

202
00:12:32.061 --> 00:12:32.855
Shit.

203
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.961
So. I came back. I thought
I could talk to someone.

204
00:12:34.995 --> 00:12:36.894
calm things down. but
they're acting crazy.

205
00:12:36.928 --> 00:12:37.273
Who?

206
00:12:37.308 --> 00:12:38.274
Everyone.

207
00:12:38.309 --> 00:12:40.035
Looks like half the
town is looking for you.

208
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:41.588
I've never seen
anything like this before.

209
00:12:41.622 --> 00:12:42.934
We've gotta get out of here.

210
00:12:42.969 --> 00:12:44.315
We can't leave
until I find the money.

211
00:12:44.349 --> 00:12:46.075
You haven't
found the safe yet?

212
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.076
Not yet.

213
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:48.871
Look. just get back
here and help me look.

214
00:12:48.906 --> 00:12:51.184
Look. these guys are
serious about hurting you.

215
00:12:51.218 --> 00:12:52.357
Welcome to my world.

216
00:12:52.392 --> 00:12:53.462
Just get back here. please.

217
00:12:53.496 --> 00:12:55.602
Yeah-yeah-yeah. when I'm
sure they can't follow me.

218
00:12:55.636 --> 00:12:56.396
Look. you stay hidden.

219
00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:00.124
Christ almighty --
oh. shit --

220
00:13:01.297 --> 00:13:03.541
Jack... Jack?

221
00:13:03.955 --> 00:13:08.132
[Breathes heavily]
Shit.

222
00:13:42.373 --> 00:13:43.615
Fuck this town.

223
00:13:51.175 --> 00:14:02.393
[Exhales deeply]
All right. come on.

224
00:14:02.427 --> 00:14:07.294
Mr. Safe. where are you?

225
00:14:34.114 --> 00:14:35.219
Hello?

226
00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:44.469
Somebody here?

227
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.348
You've got to be kidding me.

228
00:15:56.024 --> 00:15:57.163
Oh. hell no.

229
00:16:00.821 --> 00:16:06.034
Hey-hey. the fuck you doing?

230
00:16:09.485 --> 00:16:10.452
I'm talking to you.

231
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.188
Putting a
scarecrow in the field.

232
00:16:23.154 --> 00:16:24.328
Yeah. and who
told you to do that?

233
00:16:26.054 --> 00:16:27.124
Arthur.

234
00:16:29.229 --> 00:16:30.472
Arthur is dead. man.

235
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.993
Still paid me to do it.

236
00:16:35.063 --> 00:16:37.375
Well. this is my house now.
and I'm telling you

237
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.067
I don't want the scarecrow.

238
00:16:39.481 --> 00:16:41.172
Well. you're welcome to
pay me to take it down.

239
00:16:41.207 --> 00:16:43.071
might have an
opening next week.

240
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.385
[Exhales deeply]
Who are you?

241
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.802
Mason. people need things
done around here they call me.

242
00:16:51.872 --> 00:16:55.393
Well. Mason. I'm gonna need
you to take that scarecrow

243
00:16:55.428 --> 00:16:56.532
and fuck off.

244
00:16:57.119 --> 00:16:58.845
Arthur paid me
for a scarecrow.

245
00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:00.019
I'm gonna put it up.

246
00:17:01.158 --> 00:17:04.471
Or you can come down out
of that house and

247
00:17:04.506 --> 00:17:06.197
hit me with that bat.

248
00:17:06.232 --> 00:17:08.199
This fun to you.
fucking with me?

249
00:17:08.234 --> 00:17:09.649
Just giving you
options. tough guy.

250
00:17:09.683 --> 00:17:11.409
Is this really how you
want your night to go?

251
00:17:12.376 --> 00:17:17.657
Come here; attack
me with your bat.

252
00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:26.597
Okay.

253
00:17:27.149 --> 00:17:28.564
Okay. Mason. put
up your scarecrow.

254
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:35.537
I'll enjoy
watching you work for me.

255
00:18:03.703 --> 00:18:05.118
What the hell?

256
00:18:12.712 --> 00:18:14.127
Jack Attack Boxing.

257
00:18:14.162 --> 00:18:15.163
Leave a message.

258
00:18:16.164 --> 00:18:19.132
Jack. where are you. man.
[exhales deeply]

259
00:18:19.167 --> 00:18:20.720
shit is getting way
too crazy out here.

260
00:18:51.613 --> 00:18:52.579
Hello?

261
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:04.453
Hello?

262
00:19:17.535 --> 00:19:19.641
Well. you better believe I'm
not in the mood for this shit.

263
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.746
Who the fuck is in my house?

264
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:22.644
Go away.

265
00:19:22.678 --> 00:19:23.610
Go away?

266
00:19:23.645 --> 00:19:25.198
This is my house.
who the fuck are you?

267
00:19:25.233 --> 00:19:25.923
Arthur's friend.

268
00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.959
You're trespassing.
Go away.

269
00:19:29.237 --> 00:19:32.792
[Sobs]
Okay. Arthur's friend.

270
00:19:33.793 --> 00:19:36.623
I'm Ben Rakes. Arthur's son.

271
00:19:37.037 --> 00:19:38.694
Bullshit. Arthur
didn't have a son.

272
00:19:38.729 --> 00:19:40.420
We weren't close.

273
00:19:40.455 --> 00:19:41.697
I'm not surprised he
didn't mention me.

274
00:19:41.732 --> 00:19:43.665
But he did leave
the house to me.

275
00:19:43.699 --> 00:19:46.806
Come on. how many black
guys come through this town?

276
00:19:48.773 --> 00:19:51.500
What was your mother's name?

277
00:19:52.398 --> 00:19:53.537
Ellie Rakes.

278
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.412
You're like
twice Arthur's size.

279
00:20:07.654 --> 00:20:09.277
Ellie fed me well.

280
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.313
Look. I'm not
trying to scare you;

281
00:20:11.348 --> 00:20:13.626
I just wanna know
what's going on here.

282
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.388
Think of me as a skunk. I
won't make it stink

283
00:20:17.423 --> 00:20:19.252
if you don't mess with me.

284
00:20:19.287 --> 00:20:20.080
I'm not gonna mess with you;

285
00:20:20.115 --> 00:20:21.461
I didn't even know
you'd be here.

286
00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:23.670
Okay. all right.

287
00:20:23.705 --> 00:20:25.258
Let's just. uh -- Move.

288
00:20:25.293 --> 00:20:26.259
Well. where you going?

289
00:20:26.294 --> 00:20:27.536
I have to pee.

290
00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:28.710
Flashlight?

291
00:20:32.438 --> 00:20:33.646
And make sure you
put the tap on.

292
00:20:35.337 --> 00:20:37.512
I've been hiding up here since
your friend dragged you in.

293
00:20:38.582 --> 00:20:39.548
Who are you?

294
00:20:39.583 --> 00:20:40.446
Amy.

295
00:20:41.343 --> 00:20:42.551
Your dad was part of the
seniors' club

296
00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:43.863
I run at the library.

297
00:20:44.381 --> 00:20:45.174
Seniors' club?

298
00:20:45.209 --> 00:20:48.316
Yeah. uh. a-a
club for seniors.

299
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.697
There's a lot of resources
in town for older folks.

300
00:20:50.732 --> 00:20:52.837
so volunteers check up on them

301
00:20:52.872 --> 00:20:56.289
and take them to the
library and stuff.

302
00:20:56.324 --> 00:20:58.567
Your dad gave me
keys. by the way.

303
00:20:58.602 --> 00:20:59.568
I didn't break in.

304
00:20:59.603 --> 00:21:01.536
Yeah. but why are you
hiding in his house?

305
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:02.744
I thought it was empty.

306
00:21:04.504 --> 00:21:08.267
I'm sorry about
your dad passing.

307
00:21:08.888 --> 00:21:10.338
He-he was a nice guy.

308
00:21:10.372 --> 00:21:12.063
Just tell me why you're here.

309
00:21:17.137 --> 00:21:18.622
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

310
00:21:18.794 --> 00:21:19.761
Bit late for that.

311
00:21:19.795 --> 00:21:20.796
Just tell me.

312
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:24.524
Were you in town?

313
00:21:24.938 --> 00:21:27.320
Did-did you notice
people acting weird?

314
00:21:27.355 --> 00:21:27.907
Weird?

315
00:21:30.634 --> 00:21:33.533
And it's been weird
for about two weeks.

316
00:21:33.568 --> 00:21:36.847
it's always at night.
screams in the woods.

317
00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:38.504
people are setting fires.

318
00:21:40.782 --> 00:21:42.646
Two people went missing today.

319
00:21:42.922 --> 00:21:43.785
Shit.

320
00:21:44.993 --> 00:21:47.858
So. I just thought I'd come
out of town and hide here

321
00:21:47.892 --> 00:21:49.342
before it got dark.

322
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.794
I have some bad news for you;

323
00:21:52.828 --> 00:21:54.658
here is the last
place you wanna be.

324
00:21:54.934 --> 00:21:56.107
Why?

325
00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.040
I don't know about
the last two weeks.

326
00:21:58.075 --> 00:22:01.320
but tonight. I got some
folks looking for me.

327
00:22:01.596 --> 00:22:05.565
Looking for you.
what did you do?

328
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.808
I don't know.

329
00:22:06.842 --> 00:22:12.745
Jack says I won a bar fight
against the wrong white guy.

330
00:22:12.779 --> 00:22:16.473
Oh. Jesus Christ.

331
00:22:16.507 --> 00:22:17.922
Who's Jack?

332
00:22:17.957 --> 00:22:19.130
A friend.

333
00:22:20.235 --> 00:22:23.928
He's the guy who brought
me here after the bar. uh.

334
00:22:23.963 --> 00:22:25.861
Look. you should go.

335
00:22:25.896 --> 00:22:27.553
Well. I-I didn't drive here.

336
00:22:27.587 --> 00:22:29.934
and I'm not walking
in the dark. so.

337
00:22:29.969 --> 00:22:31.522
Jesus.

338
00:22:31.557 --> 00:22:35.388
Oh shit. shit.

339
00:23:07.247 --> 00:23:09.767
[Breathes heavily] Oh.

340
00:23:09.802 --> 00:23:11.459
That motherfucker.

341
00:23:12.667 --> 00:23:13.840
What is that?

342
00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:15.842
I think my old
pal Mason is back.

343
00:23:15.877 --> 00:23:18.742
Wait-wait. Mason
Banks is here?

344
00:23:18.776 --> 00:23:20.537
You know that asshole?

345
00:23:20.571 --> 00:23:23.885
Shit. don't make him
angry. he's dangerous.

346
00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:25.818
Pretty sure I just
knocked out his buddy.

347
00:23:25.852 --> 00:23:28.579
No. I'm-I'm being serious.
I've seen him hurt people.

348
00:23:28.614 --> 00:23:30.581
He's probably on
something. he's fucked up.

349
00:23:30.616 --> 00:23:32.825
[Breathes heavily]
He's probably just an asshole.

350
00:23:32.859 --> 00:23:34.861
[Breathes heavily]

351
00:23:34.896 --> 00:23:34.999
[Breathes heavily]
He's probably just an asshole.

352
00:23:40.177 --> 00:23:40.971
Listen to me.

353
00:23:41.937 --> 00:23:43.560
don't go out there.
it's what he wants.

354
00:23:43.594 --> 00:23:45.596
How's your buddy's
jaw doing. Mason?

355
00:23:47.771 --> 00:23:50.670
Hold this; I don't
wanna break it too.

356
00:23:50.705 --> 00:23:51.913
Don't.

357
00:23:54.709 --> 00:23:55.641
Close the door.

358
00:23:56.918 --> 00:23:57.815
Close the door.

359
00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.058
Oh darn.

360
00:24:03.787 --> 00:24:04.822
Come here. Mason.

361
00:24:07.756 --> 00:24:08.964
[Screams] Come here.

362
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.607
[Breathes heavily]
[rumbling]

363
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.204
[banging]

364
00:25:58.971 --> 00:26:01.042
[knocking]

365
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.977
[bangs]

366
00:26:10.672 --> 00:26:16.264
[incessant knocking]

367
00:26:16.713 --> 00:26:17.955
[screams]

368
00:26:19.785 --> 00:26:20.958
Got you [laughs].

369
00:26:21.856 --> 00:26:28.172
Oh. fuck. Ted.
what the fuck?

370
00:26:28.932 --> 00:26:31.900
What the fuck is right.
what is this spooky thing?

371
00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:33.902
And why are you here?

372
00:26:33.937 --> 00:26:35.663
What are you doing here?

373
00:26:35.697 --> 00:26:36.767
Look. we live next door.

374
00:26:36.802 --> 00:26:37.768
[Whispers] What?

375
00:26:37.803 --> 00:26:40.012
We heard yelling from
our bedroom window.

376
00:26:40.046 --> 00:26:41.082
What the hell is going on?

377
00:26:41.116 --> 00:26:44.672
Sorry. I. uh -- You know
what. I can't hear you.

378
00:26:44.706 --> 00:26:45.811
Come to the door.

379
00:26:45.845 --> 00:26:48.814
Uh-huh. okay-okay-okay.

380
00:26:52.162 --> 00:26:53.888
Hey. you okay?

381
00:26:53.922 --> 00:26:55.924
No. Mason is here.
he's causing trouble.

382
00:26:55.959 --> 00:26:57.650
Mason is here.

383
00:26:57.685 --> 00:27:00.446
Shit. I hate that fucking guy.

384
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.690
Listen; maybe you should come
hang with Lisa and me

385
00:27:02.724 --> 00:27:03.932
until we figure this all out.

386
00:27:03.967 --> 00:27:07.004
[Screams]
Hey. get away from them.

387
00:27:07.936 --> 00:27:08.903
Come after me.

388
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:11.940
Get away from her.

389
00:27:11.975 --> 00:27:12.700
Be right back.

390
00:27:12.734 --> 00:27:14.115
Oh-oh -- oh god.

391
00:27:14.943 --> 00:27:17.705
[Breathes heavily]

392
00:27:22.364 --> 00:27:23.987
Oh fuck.

393
00:27:28.025 --> 00:27:31.719
[Screams] You're gonna.
fucking. let go.

394
00:27:32.064 --> 00:27:33.721
Go [screams].

395
00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:43.696
[Screams]
[Groans in pain]

396
00:27:44.386 --> 00:27:47.251
- Ahhh!
- [Moans in pain]

397
00:27:47.286 --> 00:27:49.737
Oh. oh my god.

398
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:51.704
[Screams]
[Moaning in pain]

399
00:28:00.748 --> 00:28:02.715
Oh my god...

400
00:28:06.754 --> 00:28:10.240
[Moans in pain] I don't know
what to do.

401
00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:12.725
[Whispers] I've got
my bag. my bag.

402
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.002
What?

403
00:28:14.037 --> 00:28:16.004
Get my fucking gym bag.

404
00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:20.008
There's-there's clean wraps
inside next to my boxing gloves.

405
00:28:20.043 --> 00:28:21.734
Okay.

406
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:27.153
[Moans in pain]
Okay-okay-okay.

407
00:28:28.085 --> 00:28:29.293
Okay. what do I do?

408
00:28:29.328 --> 00:28:31.882
Wrap my fucking arm.

409
00:28:32.193 --> 00:28:34.160
[Moans in pain]
Okay-okay-okay.

410
00:28:34.195 --> 00:28:35.299
calm down. calm
down. calm down.

411
00:28:35.334 --> 00:28:37.888
Calm down. just. uh -- okay.

412
00:28:37.923 --> 00:28:39.890
Okay. all right.

413
00:28:39.925 --> 00:28:41.547
All right. okay.

414
00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:44.274
I need you to keep
going even if I pass out.

415
00:28:44.308 --> 00:28:46.276
No-no-no. you are not
leaving me to do this alone.

416
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.966
Stay awake. okay?

417
00:28:47.001 --> 00:28:49.175
Just talk to me. talk to me.

418
00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:54.249
[Breathes heavily]
There was someone else

419
00:28:54.284 --> 00:28:58.184
with Mason out
there in the dark.

420
00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:00.255
What?

421
00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.259
I couldn't see properly.
but he was fucking huge.

422
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.054
All right. just-just breathe.

423
00:29:06.089 --> 00:29:07.193
- [Moans in pain]
- No-no-no. shhh...

424
00:29:07.228 --> 00:29:11.128
just breathe in and out.

425
00:29:11.163 --> 00:29:16.927
[Exhales deeply]
Oh. fuck me [moans in pain].

426
00:29:24.245 --> 00:29:25.902
Why didn't they kill us?

427
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.283
I think they tried their best.

428
00:29:28.318 --> 00:29:30.182
No-no. I mean the
door was wide open.

429
00:29:30.216 --> 00:29:31.597
Why didn't they come inside?

430
00:29:31.631 --> 00:29:34.911
I don't know. maybe
they're enjoying themselves.

431
00:29:34.945 --> 00:29:36.188
None of this makes any sense.

432
00:29:36.222 --> 00:29:38.811
I grew up around Ted and Lisa.
they sell CBD dog biscuits.

433
00:29:38.846 --> 00:29:40.882
and now they're hacking
people up with machetes.

434
00:29:40.917 --> 00:29:43.057
because some black guy
got into a bar fight?

435
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:45.231
Maybe you don't know them
as well as you think you do.

436
00:29:45.266 --> 00:29:47.958
Or maybe something
weird is going on.

437
00:29:47.993 --> 00:29:52.100
like I told you. the
whole town is acting bizarre.

438
00:29:53.653 --> 00:29:55.828
Maybe they're not in control.

439
00:29:56.173 --> 00:29:57.209
Bullshit.

440
00:29:57.381 --> 00:29:58.555
What are you doing?

441
00:29:58.589 --> 00:30:03.871
I'm not gonna stay here and
listen to you give excuses

442
00:30:03.905 --> 00:30:06.425
for your racist white
supremacist friends.

443
00:30:06.459 --> 00:30:08.220
I'm serious; we need to
figure out what's happening.

444
00:30:08.254 --> 00:30:10.981
We have to get the
fuck out of here.

445
00:30:11.016 --> 00:30:12.327
Now. Jack's coming
back with the car.

446
00:30:12.362 --> 00:30:14.951
But first. I have to
find my dad's safe.

447
00:30:14.985 --> 00:30:15.503
Why?

448
00:30:15.537 --> 00:30:16.366
Who the fuck cares?

449
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.299
I do.

450
00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:19.921
I need it.

451
00:30:20.439 --> 00:30:21.992
Are you serious?

452
00:30:24.339 --> 00:30:26.238
Ben?

453
00:30:33.003 --> 00:30:34.073
You dropped your phone.

454
00:30:34.246 --> 00:30:35.834
All this over a bar fight?

455
00:30:42.392 --> 00:30:43.876
Amy. right?

456
00:30:43.911 --> 00:30:45.257
Yeah. oh. that's cute.

457
00:30:47.328 --> 00:30:48.432
Mason.

458
00:30:48.467 --> 00:30:52.160
I remember you. always sitting
in the corner of the

459
00:30:52.195 --> 00:30:55.267
bar with a fork. alone.

460
00:30:57.062 --> 00:30:58.166
I don't know how
you ended up here.

461
00:30:58.201 --> 00:30:59.374
I don't care.

462
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.205
Just stop
helping him. go home.

463
00:31:04.345 --> 00:31:06.002
Mason. this is fucked.

464
00:31:06.174 --> 00:31:10.213
Amy. I promise you
haven't seen anything yet.

465
00:31:13.216 --> 00:31:15.011
Now. are you staying
or are you leaving?

466
00:31:17.254 --> 00:31:18.946
You don't even know him.

467
00:31:20.948 --> 00:31:22.087
Your call.

468
00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:42.245
You can't come
inside. can you?

469
00:31:47.422 --> 00:31:49.079
What's really happening here?

470
00:31:50.978 --> 00:31:52.531
Why are you doing this?

471
00:31:54.119 --> 00:31:56.121
It's me now or
half the town later.

472
00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.055
they're gonna figure
out where you are.

473
00:32:02.161 --> 00:32:07.028
Come outside. get past me.
you can make your escape.

474
00:32:11.343 --> 00:32:14.104
[Breathes heavily]

475
00:32:14.139 --> 00:32:15.934
I like disappointing you. Mason.

476
00:32:26.151 --> 00:32:28.429
We're gonna finish
what we started.

477
00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:37.472
You're right. there's
something else going on here.

478
00:32:38.301 --> 00:32:38.991
Turn off the lights.

479
00:32:39.026 --> 00:32:40.441
They already know we're here.

480
00:32:40.613 --> 00:32:42.236
We don't want
them knowing where.

481
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.445
We could block
out the bedroom.

482
00:32:57.113 --> 00:33:00.185
I found some
ibuprofen in the bathroom.

483
00:33:00.219 --> 00:33:01.324
I'm sorry. it's
not gonna do much.

484
00:33:01.358 --> 00:33:03.809
Thanks. I'm fine. I just
-- I need to keep moving.

485
00:33:03.843 --> 00:33:05.500
You should still take it.

486
00:33:07.192 --> 00:33:09.159
Uh. I'm an addict. doesn't
matter if it's sugar pills.

487
00:33:09.194 --> 00:33:10.540
I can't take them.

488
00:33:12.059 --> 00:33:14.164
I'll. um -- uh. at
least have some water.

489
00:33:14.199 --> 00:33:15.338
Here.

490
00:33:17.133 --> 00:33:18.444
Thanks.

491
00:33:25.313 --> 00:33:27.626
[Exhales deeply]
Okay.

492
00:33:28.144 --> 00:33:30.180
I got to find that safe
before Jack gets back.

493
00:33:30.215 --> 00:33:31.285
No-no. hold on. hold on.

494
00:33:31.319 --> 00:33:32.527
We have to figure out
what the fuck's going on.

495
00:33:32.562 --> 00:33:35.047
Uh-huh. you already figured
out that they can't come in.

496
00:33:35.082 --> 00:33:36.497
that's good enough for now.

497
00:33:36.531 --> 00:33:38.326
Now. you're gonna help me
[exhales deeply]

498
00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:39.603
or you can stay here.

499
00:33:39.638 --> 00:33:42.365
No. uh. what. uh --
what about your friend.

500
00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:44.298
we can't warn him.

501
00:33:44.332 --> 00:33:46.541
Mason has your phone.
I don't have one.

502
00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:47.508
What's Mason gonna do

503
00:33:47.542 --> 00:33:49.855
when the -- your friend
comes rolling in?

504
00:33:49.889 --> 00:33:50.787
Oh fuck.

505
00:33:50.821 --> 00:33:52.271
Okay. all right.
all right. all right.

506
00:33:52.306 --> 00:33:54.860
just-just -- all
right. just listen.

507
00:33:54.894 --> 00:33:56.482
just calm down. okay?

508
00:33:56.517 --> 00:33:58.243
All right. we just have to
figure out

509
00:33:58.277 --> 00:34:00.624
what's happening. okay.

510
00:34:00.659 --> 00:34:03.213
I didn't tell you everything
about me and your dad.

511
00:34:06.492 --> 00:34:07.562
Go on.

512
00:34:08.805 --> 00:34:13.258
I. uh. wasn't just keeping
your dad's spare keys for him.

513
00:34:13.292 --> 00:34:17.365
He told me that if anything
weird happened in town that

514
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.541
I was supposed to
come here and hide.

515
00:34:21.197 --> 00:34:23.475
He said it would be safe.

516
00:34:23.509 --> 00:34:24.234
What?

517
00:34:24.269 --> 00:34:25.270
Yeah.

518
00:34:25.304 --> 00:34:27.444
I mean. yeah. I thought
he was a bit eccentric.

519
00:34:27.479 --> 00:34:31.379
but I think -- I think now.

520
00:34:31.414 --> 00:34:34.520
I think he knew something like
this was going to happen.

521
00:34:34.555 --> 00:34:35.797
How?

522
00:34:35.832 --> 00:34:39.663
I don't know. but the research
he was doing at the library.

523
00:34:39.698 --> 00:34:42.390
it was some
really creepy stuff.

524
00:34:42.425 --> 00:34:43.667
Now what kinda stuff?

525
00:34:43.702 --> 00:34:46.153
Well. he would read -- reading
these old books and in these

526
00:34:46.187 --> 00:34:51.675
languages I didn't understand.
but there were diagrams

527
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.231
and there were images.

528
00:34:55.679 --> 00:35:00.581
and they looked evil. demonic.

529
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.100
Come on. Amy.

530
00:35:02.134 --> 00:35:04.136
I'm not messing
around. I swear.

531
00:35:04.171 --> 00:35:05.689
But what does this
have to do with anything?

532
00:35:05.724 --> 00:35:09.383
I just -- I mean. uh -- you
have to admit the whole not

533
00:35:09.417 --> 00:35:11.661
being able to come inside
thing is pretty strange.

534
00:35:11.695 --> 00:35:12.869
Sure. we can
call that strange.

535
00:35:12.903 --> 00:35:16.286
Yeah. and-and like I said.
everything was acting weird

536
00:35:16.321 --> 00:35:18.288
in town before you
even got here.

537
00:35:18.323 --> 00:35:20.566
Yeah. and you wanna
blame that on demons?

538
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:22.361
No -- I don't know. maybe.

539
00:35:22.396 --> 00:35:23.673
You gotta be
kidding me. come on.

540
00:35:23.707 --> 00:35:26.296
Look. I just wanna
know what's going on.

541
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:27.642
Why aren't Ted and Lisa
breaking through

542
00:35:27.677 --> 00:35:29.299
the windows right now?

543
00:35:29.334 --> 00:35:33.165
They're racist white
people. they do crazy shit.

544
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.718
And they're just
probably fucking with us.

545
00:35:34.753 --> 00:35:38.377
I just think that if we
could find some of your dad's

546
00:35:38.412 --> 00:35:41.346
research it could give us a
clue as to what's going on.

547
00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.450
Demon research.

548
00:35:42.485 --> 00:35:46.627
Uh -- No [moans in pain].

549
00:35:46.661 --> 00:35:47.283
Where are you going?

550
00:35:47.317 --> 00:35:49.181
To find my father's safe.

551
00:35:49.216 --> 00:35:51.632
How can you think
about money right now?

552
00:35:51.666 --> 00:35:54.635
I promised Jack I'd
find it. and I owe him.

553
00:35:54.669 --> 00:35:55.739
What is he. your bookie?

554
00:35:55.774 --> 00:35:57.983
What kind of friend
needs your money this badly?

555
00:35:58.017 --> 00:36:02.298
My only friend and he'd dying.

556
00:36:02.332 --> 00:36:05.439
What?

557
00:36:05.473 --> 00:36:08.338
Cancer.

558
00:36:08.373 --> 00:36:12.239
And I don't want him to
spend his last days broke.

559
00:36:12.273 --> 00:36:17.416
in a rat-infested
hospice. because of me.

560
00:36:18.659 --> 00:36:20.212
Because of you?

561
00:36:20.247 --> 00:36:21.075
What?

562
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:27.392
Just wanna know my
whole life story?

563
00:36:27.426 --> 00:36:32.604
Fine. got all the time
in the world. right?

564
00:36:38.265 --> 00:36:40.577
[Exhales deeply]

565
00:36:45.927 --> 00:36:49.448
Jack was my boxing trainer
and manager

566
00:36:49.483 --> 00:36:53.659
ever since I was a
kid he'd look out for me.

567
00:36:53.694 --> 00:36:59.044
in the ring and out. even
when I was being a shitty kid

568
00:36:59.078 --> 00:37:02.703
thinking I was invincible.

569
00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.433
For a time I kinda was.
I was winning fights.

570
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.333
then I started partying hard.

571
00:37:13.645 --> 00:37:16.234
Jack wanted me to
stop. but I didn't listen.

572
00:37:17.649 --> 00:37:22.378
I got out of control. ended
up hurting this guy

573
00:37:22.412 --> 00:37:27.590
before the actual fight at the
fucking weigh-ins.

574
00:37:27.624 --> 00:37:30.696
Boxing commission
came down hard.

575
00:37:30.731 --> 00:37:32.319
revoked my license.

576
00:37:32.871 --> 00:37:36.702
Now. both me and
Jack are broke.

577
00:37:36.737 --> 00:37:39.429
and he's got cancer.

578
00:37:42.708 --> 00:37:47.092
So Arthur's money is the only
way I know how to make his

579
00:37:47.126 --> 00:37:48.749
life a little bit
more comfortable.

580
00:37:51.545 --> 00:37:53.374
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

581
00:37:55.618 --> 00:37:57.723
Something here is fucked.

582
00:37:58.759 --> 00:38:02.314
And I don't know what I'm
gonna do when Jack gets here.

583
00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:05.490
but it's all for nothing
if I don't find that money.

584
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.568
Come with me.

585
00:38:25.717 --> 00:38:27.615
I've been all over the house
looking for more of your dad's

586
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.755
research.
there's no safe here.

587
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:32.758
The only place I
haven't gone is the cellar.

588
00:38:32.793 --> 00:38:38.695
but the entrance is on
the side of the house.

589
00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:40.387
you have to go outside.

590
00:38:40.801 --> 00:38:42.354
Of course it is.

591
00:38:42.768 --> 00:38:43.769
You really think it's there?

592
00:38:43.804 --> 00:38:44.701
Maybe.

593
00:38:45.909 --> 00:38:48.809
And sometimes when I pick up
Arthur he'd be down there.

594
00:38:48.843 --> 00:38:50.776
He said it was
cooler in the summer.

595
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.260
How far exactly?

596
00:38:52.295 --> 00:38:57.542
Well. it's. um -- it's
from there to around there.

597
00:38:57.956 --> 00:38:59.164
Okay.

598
00:39:00.683 --> 00:39:05.412
If I go in the dark and keep
quiet I think I can get inside

599
00:39:05.446 --> 00:39:06.792
without them noticing.

600
00:39:06.827 --> 00:39:08.415
Can you run in your condition?

601
00:39:09.692 --> 00:39:12.419
Yeah. it's not
far. I'll be fine.

602
00:39:12.936 --> 00:39:16.457
Listen. we know they
can't come in the house.

603
00:39:16.492 --> 00:39:18.942
but what about under it.
does the cellar count?

604
00:39:20.461 --> 00:39:24.672
I don't know. we have to
try; give me your knife.

605
00:39:24.707 --> 00:39:27.503
For fuck sake. I'm not staying
here alone in the dark.

606
00:39:27.537 --> 00:39:30.160
And besides. you'll never
find the door without me.

607
00:39:32.818 --> 00:39:33.923
I appreciate it.

608
00:39:36.581 --> 00:39:40.585
On three. I'm gonna
turn off the light.

609
00:39:41.482 --> 00:39:45.797
you're gonna open the
door. we're gonna keep quiet.

610
00:39:47.039 --> 00:39:49.904
If I get caught you run back.

611
00:39:53.874 --> 00:39:57.464
Fuck. Ben. I don't wanna die.

612
00:39:59.914 --> 00:40:01.399
We better make it.

613
00:40:03.021 --> 00:40:08.475
One. two. three.

614
00:40:09.924 --> 00:40:12.202
[door opens]

615
00:40:12.237 --> 00:40:14.032

616
00:40:14.204 --> 00:40:15.171
[door shuts]

[crickets chirping]

618
00:40:22.834 --> 00:40:25.008
[BEN] Amy. where are you?

619
00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:30.082

620

[WOMAN] [Laughs]

[Moans in pain]

631
00:41:03.806 --> 00:41:07.568
[Exhales deeply]
Did you see Lisa?

632
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:08.776
Lisa?

633
00:41:08.811 --> 00:41:10.260
She was trying to pull you
into the trees.

634
00:41:10.295 --> 00:41:11.158
Yeah.

635
00:41:12.124 --> 00:41:14.782

...where's the knife?

636
00:41:14.817 --> 00:41:17.060
[Exhales deeply] Oh
my god. oh my god.

637
00:41:17.095 --> 00:41:17.923
I must've dropped it.

638

-Oh. you gotta be fucking
kidding me. -I'm so sorry.

639
00:41:20.167 --> 00:41:22.549
I'm sorry. I'm so fucked.

00:41:22.583 --> 00:41:23.757
[Exhales deeply] Oh my god.

641
00:41:23.791 --> 00:41:25.828
Oh my god. I'm gonna be sick.
Oh my god. I'm so sorry.

00:41:25.862 --> 00:41:28.037
Come on.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[Breathes deeply]
No. sorry. I'm sorry.

644
00:41:31.005 --> 00:41:32.697
You just saved me. all right;

645
00:41:32.731 --> 00:41:34.975
just -- I-I shouldn't have
made us do that.

646
00:41:35.009 --> 00:41:37.529
Um. it's -- I told you
something fucked was going on.

647
00:41:37.564 --> 00:41:38.668
Look. we're
gonna figure it out.

648
00:41:38.703 --> 00:41:39.911
We're gonna find
that fucking safe.

649
00:41:39.945 --> 00:41:41.637
and we get the
fuck outta here.

650
00:41:41.671 --> 00:41:44.743
I'll be okay. just
give me a second.

651
00:41:44.778 --> 00:41:49.058
Oh my god [exhales deeply].

652
00:41:51.025 --> 00:41:53.027
What is that?

653
00:41:59.068 --> 00:42:00.794
Looks like an
old church pulpit.

654
00:42:00.828 --> 00:42:02.796
Well. as one of the
only Jews in town.

655
00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:04.867
I'm gonna take
your word on that.

656
00:42:07.663 --> 00:42:09.872
Yeah. it's a church pulpit.

657
00:42:09.906 --> 00:42:14.566
Second Coming Baptist
Church. 1965.

658
00:42:15.878 --> 00:42:16.982
Oh. look at this.

659
00:42:17.017 --> 00:42:17.811
What is it?

660
00:42:17.845 --> 00:42:18.812
It's some of your
dad's research.

661
00:42:18.846 --> 00:42:21.573
old photocopies.

662
00:42:21.608 --> 00:42:24.127
"Reverend Peter Rakes and son
Arthur outside of Kingsport's

663

first integrated church.

664
00:42:27.717 --> 00:42:29.754
Ben. I think this is your
father and grandpa there.

665
00:42:29.788 --> 00:42:33.585
Let me see that.

666
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.691
Tragedy in Kingsport.

667
00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.590
Authorities are investigating
possible arson after Second

669
00:42:41.006 --> 00:42:43.940
Reverend Peter Rakes is
believed to have perished

in the blaze.

671
00:42:45.666 --> 00:42:47.599
Arson?

672
00:42:47.634 --> 00:42:49.118
Your father must have brought
your grandfather's

673
00:42:49.152 --> 00:42:50.740
old pulpit down here.

674
00:42:51.016 --> 00:42:53.640
It's probably all that
was left after the fire.

675
00:42:58.058 --> 00:42:59.611
What the fuck?
What?

676
00:42:59.646 --> 00:43:01.820
Look at the date
of the newspaper.

677
00:43:01.855 --> 00:43:04.789
Friday. October 3rd. 1969.

678
00:43:04.823 --> 00:43:06.894
Yeah. but the
actual fire. it says.

679
00:43:06.929 --> 00:43:09.932
was on Wednesday. the 1st.

680
00:43:09.966 --> 00:43:11.105
Yeah.

681
00:43:16.939 --> 00:43:19.389
It's the same as the
code for the safe.

682
00:43:21.184 --> 00:43:23.083
Oh my god. October 1st.

683
00:43:23.117 --> 00:43:24.187

00:43:24.222 --> 00:43:25.706
What does it mean?

00:43:25.741 --> 00:43:26.638
I don't know.

686
00:43:26.673 --> 00:43:27.294
What else is there?

687
00:43:27.328 --> 00:43:30.746
Um. an old police report.

688
00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:31.954
About the fire?

689
00:43:31.988 --> 00:43:34.646
I don't think -- uh. no.
it's dated a few days before.

690
00:43:34.681 --> 00:43:36.959
It's so faded. I
can't read it.

[Screams] [Breathes heavily]
- It's me.

708
00:45:02.113 --> 00:45:03.942
-it's me.

709
00:45:07.566 --> 00:45:09.051
You're good.

710
00:45:09.914 --> 00:45:11.916
Hey. we're good.

711
00:45:14.125 --> 00:45:17.887
[Breathes heavily]

712
00:45:17.922 --> 00:45:21.926
Well. I guess I found your
fucking safe. huh.

713
00:45:30.797 --> 00:45:36.906
[Breathes heavily]
[Makes popping noise]

714
00:45:36.941 --> 00:45:38.218
Holy shit.

715
00:45:39.598 --> 00:45:41.152
This had better be worth it.

716
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.880
Did that motherfucker
say he wanted to eat me?

717
00:45:45.604 --> 00:45:54.268
[Laugh]
[Laughs]

718
00:45:54.303 --> 00:45:57.824
Cannibal cult?
Oh. fuck me.

719
00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.309
[Exhales deeply] Oh.

720
00:46:01.206 --> 00:46:07.212
Hey. thank you. couldn't
have done this without you.

721
00:46:08.006 --> 00:46:09.076
No kidding.

722
00:46:11.872 --> 00:46:15.289
Arthur. what the
fuck were you up to.

723
00:46:16.049 --> 00:46:17.360
Uh. let me see
the police report.

724
00:46:17.395 --> 00:46:18.879
Can you read it?

725
00:46:18.914 --> 00:46:20.881
If you put the
light up here maybe.

726
00:46:20.916 --> 00:46:22.918
[Laughs] Okay.

727
00:46:23.953 --> 00:46:28.164
Okay. I see my grandfather's
name and -- no way.

728
00:46:28.924 --> 00:46:29.856
What?

729
00:46:30.857 --> 00:46:32.790
The home address is
the same as the church.

730
00:46:33.031 --> 00:46:33.929
So?

731
00:46:34.239 --> 00:46:35.275
Read it.

732
00:46:41.281 --> 00:46:42.282
It was here.

733
00:46:43.386 --> 00:46:45.803
Yeah. I my dad didn't
bring the pulpit downstairs.

734
00:46:46.873 --> 00:46:48.115
It was always there.

735
00:46:49.323 --> 00:46:51.360
Your dad built the house where
your grandfather's church

736
00:46:51.394 --> 00:46:52.395
burned down.

737
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:56.986
Yeah. my dad retired and
moved home. literally.

738
00:46:57.021 --> 00:46:57.676
But why?

739
00:46:57.711 --> 00:46:58.919
Not for the happy memories.

740
00:46:58.954 --> 00:47:00.058
For protection.

741
00:47:00.093 --> 00:47:01.301
From what?

742
00:47:03.372 --> 00:47:05.961
If the house is on the same
land as the church

743
00:47:05.995 --> 00:47:08.618
then it's on
consecrated grounds.

744
00:47:10.068 --> 00:47:11.414
Holy shit.

745
00:47:11.898 --> 00:47:13.002
Exactly.

746
00:47:13.692 --> 00:47:16.903
That's why cannibal
cult can't come inside.

747
00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:18.628
Maybe you're right.

748
00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:25.463
Something demonic is going on.
And maybe my dad knew it.

749
00:47:26.153 --> 00:47:27.258
Uh. maybe.

750
00:47:27.292 --> 00:47:28.259
You've got all
your dad's research.

751
00:47:28.293 --> 00:47:30.295
You've got cannibal
guy. down in the cellar.

752
00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:32.159
puking blood when
it comes inside.

753
00:47:32.194 --> 00:47:32.988
and now this.

754
00:47:33.022 --> 00:47:35.266
What more
evidence do you need?

755
00:47:36.474 --> 00:47:38.200
Yeah. but why is
this happening?

756
00:47:38.234 --> 00:47:39.891
What's the point?

757
00:47:39.926 --> 00:47:41.134
I don't know.

758
00:47:41.444 --> 00:47:43.446
And why is your dad's safe
combo the same as

759
00:47:43.481 --> 00:47:45.069
the date of the fire?

760
00:47:45.932 --> 00:47:46.277
Fuck.

761
00:47:49.487 --> 00:47:53.422
If there's no money in
there this is all for nothing.

762
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:56.183
Okay. well. calm down.
let's just open it.

763
00:47:56.218 --> 00:47:57.978
[Door knocks]

764
00:48:00.084 --> 00:48:01.430
Oh. this keeps getting better.

765
00:48:04.088 --> 00:48:08.230
[Door knocks] Hello?

766
00:48:09.093 --> 00:48:10.439
Hello. Ben Rakes. you there?

767
00:48:11.026 --> 00:48:13.269
Hey. your friend Jack sent me.

768
00:48:13.442 --> 00:48:14.236
Ben?

769
00:48:16.376 --> 00:48:20.207
Hey. my name is Jay Amir; I'm
a nurse at Kingsport General.

770
00:48:20.242 --> 00:48:22.209
Your friend Jack
told me what happened.

771
00:48:22.244 --> 00:48:28.112
said I should come
look at your hand.

772
00:48:28.146 --> 00:48:29.078
Where's Jack?

773
00:48:29.113 --> 00:48:30.286
Ben?

774
00:48:30.321 --> 00:48:32.081
Where is Jack?

775
00:48:32.116 --> 00:48:36.396
He was involved in a fight.
he's being held in emergency.

776
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:41.919
Ben. what are we
doing here. man?

777
00:48:43.368 --> 00:48:44.335
Hold on.

778
00:48:48.028 --> 00:48:53.413
[Breathes heavily]
Seriously?

779
00:48:54.379 --> 00:48:55.173
No.

780
00:48:56.002 --> 00:49:02.284
[Breathes heavily]
There we go.

781
00:49:03.285 --> 00:49:04.251
Don't drop that one.

782
00:49:07.151 --> 00:49:09.360
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah.
what the fuck?

783
00:49:09.394 --> 00:49:11.983
What are you doing?

784
00:49:12.018 --> 00:49:14.365
Uh. sorry. we're just.
um -- We were attacked.

785
00:49:15.228 --> 00:49:17.506
Christ. everyone in
this town has gone nuts.

786
00:49:18.265 --> 00:49:19.991
No-no. I'm out.

787
00:49:20.026 --> 00:49:25.134
Oh -- Wait. hey.
is Jack all right?

788
00:49:26.032 --> 00:49:27.309
Ask him yourself.
he's at the hospital.

789
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:29.242
Oh please-please.
we need help.

790
00:49:29.276 --> 00:49:30.450
please.

791
00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:35.455
Let me see.

792
00:49:39.597 --> 00:49:41.185
Show me the damage.

793
00:49:41.564 --> 00:49:42.565
Check her first.

794
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.153
I can see you both.

795
00:49:44.188 --> 00:49:46.052
and right now you need
medical attention.

796
00:49:46.638 --> 00:49:48.364
It's okay. Ben.
I'm a big girl.

797
00:49:48.571 --> 00:49:52.299
[Breathes heavily]

798
00:49:52.334 --> 00:49:55.302
Jesus. I thought it was
just your hand.

799
00:49:55.578 --> 00:50:00.445
It was till the local lynch
mob got me [moans in pain].

800
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.515
Okay.

801
00:50:02.758 --> 00:50:04.208
If I take that wrap off the
bleeding is gonna get worse.

802
00:50:05.278 --> 00:50:08.246
Here. best I can do
right now is antibiotics.

803
00:50:08.557 --> 00:50:10.559
No pills. I'm a
recovering addict.

804
00:50:10.593 --> 00:50:12.423
No. it's
penicillin. not painkillers.

805
00:50:12.457 --> 00:50:13.320
I can't do it. man.

806
00:50:13.355 --> 00:50:14.839
You know I'm here
to help you. right.

807
00:50:14.873 --> 00:50:18.256
He said no; he
needs a hospital.

808
00:50:18.291 --> 00:50:21.121
we both do.

809
00:50:21.156 --> 00:50:23.020
Yeah. you're right.

810
00:50:23.675 --> 00:50:27.058
And Jack said that the sheriff
is helping people look for me.

811
00:50:27.231 --> 00:50:28.508
I don't think that's safe.

812
00:50:29.371 --> 00:50:31.580
There's a -- there's a
hospital in Elliot Lake.

813
00:50:31.614 --> 00:50:33.582
Could-could you
drive us there?

814
00:50:36.136 --> 00:50:38.138
Okay.

815
00:50:39.657 --> 00:50:42.246
Get in the back. stay low.

816
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:44.489
Let's go.

817
00:50:44.524 --> 00:50:46.250
[Moans in pain] Come on.

818
00:50:47.216 --> 00:50:49.529
Uh. wait. I
forgot this safe box.

819
00:50:49.563 --> 00:50:50.633
I'll be right back.

820
00:50:52.118 --> 00:50:53.291
Uh-uh. no. there's no time.

821
00:50:53.326 --> 00:50:54.465
Just give me a second.

822
00:50:54.499 --> 00:50:56.191
No. look -- okay. you
should not be walking around.

823
00:50:56.225 --> 00:50:57.640
just get in the
car. Amy will get it.

824
00:50:57.675 --> 00:51:04.544
[Breathes heavily]
What - what are you two doing?

825
00:51:06.718 --> 00:51:08.306
How did you know my name?

826
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:13.104
I-I don't know. Jack
told me when we were.

827
00:51:13.139 --> 00:51:15.417
uh. when. uh -- uh.

828
00:51:16.901 --> 00:51:18.489
[Sighs]

829
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:22.562
you got me.

830
00:51:43.721 --> 00:51:45.792
You motherfuckers.

831
00:51:52.212 --> 00:51:53.455
Seriously. you?

832
00:51:54.973 --> 00:51:56.285
Birds of a feather.

833
00:51:57.459 --> 00:51:59.185
Aren't you both clever.

834
00:51:59.495 --> 00:52:00.496
Jesus.

835
00:52:00.531 --> 00:52:04.121
I told you. I like
disappointing you. Mason.

836
00:52:05.605 --> 00:52:07.538
Ben. let's go into the house.

837
00:52:07.572 --> 00:52:10.437
What the hell is this anyway.
some sort of racist cult.

838
00:52:10.472 --> 00:52:12.405
with a side of brown?

839
00:52:12.612 --> 00:52:14.441
You guys like going
out picking fights.

840
00:52:14.476 --> 00:52:15.822
trying to kill black folks.

841
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.169
Well. it's not going too
well this time. is it?

842
00:52:18.204 --> 00:52:19.757
You know. it would've been
over real quick if you just

843
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:21.241
passed out at the bar.

844
00:52:21.276 --> 00:52:22.484
Quiet.

845
00:52:22.518 --> 00:52:23.657
Passed out?

846
00:52:24.762 --> 00:52:25.694
You don't drink.

847
00:52:25.728 --> 00:52:26.453
No. I don't.

848
00:52:26.488 --> 00:52:28.973
Did you drug me
with something?

849
00:52:29.007 --> 00:52:33.495
Yeah. don't feel bad.
addict's tolerance.

850
00:52:34.461 --> 00:52:37.464
Come out of the house now
and no one else gets hurt.

851
00:52:37.499 --> 00:52:39.777
You wanna eat us. Mason?

852
00:52:39.811 --> 00:52:41.986
The guy in the basement
said that just before

853
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.782
we bashed his brains out.

854
00:52:44.816 --> 00:52:48.268
So. let me ask you. do you
wanna get a slice of white

855
00:52:48.303 --> 00:52:50.477
bread and eat us?

856
00:52:54.723 --> 00:52:56.276
Just you.

857
00:52:57.519 --> 00:53:00.970
What's fucking wrong with you?

858
00:53:02.317 --> 00:53:04.629
I am sorry you keep bringing
other people into this. Ben.

859
00:53:05.665 --> 00:53:07.218
I didn't wanna do this.

860
00:53:07.253 --> 00:53:08.046
This?

861
00:53:08.081 --> 00:53:09.807
What's this?
Ben. let's just go.

862
00:53:09.841 --> 00:53:12.810
You better come out of
the house now. Ben.

863
00:53:12.844 --> 00:53:14.398
Oh yeah.

864
00:53:21.301 --> 00:53:22.371
What is this?

865
00:53:22.406 --> 00:53:26.582
Okay-okay-okay
[moans in pain].

866
00:53:26.617 --> 00:53:27.790
The fuck.
Don't.

867
00:53:27.825 --> 00:53:29.792
Ben. just get
back in the house.

868
00:53:29.827 --> 00:53:31.484
fuck these guys.

869
00:53:31.518 --> 00:53:34.694
[Moans in pain]
Like I said. Ben.

870
00:53:34.728 --> 00:53:36.730
come out of the house
and no one else gets hurt.

871
00:53:36.765 --> 00:53:38.732
I'm gonna fucking kill
you if you hurt him.

872
00:53:38.767 --> 00:53:39.561
Stay back.

873
00:53:39.595 --> 00:53:40.424
Fuck.

874
00:53:40.458 --> 00:53:41.804
[Exhales deeply]

875
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:45.429
What?

876
00:53:50.503 --> 00:53:53.022
[Breathes heavily]

877
00:53:54.438 --> 00:53:59.891
[Moans in pain]

878
00:54:00.961 --> 00:54:04.448
[Car engine revving]

879
00:54:06.588 --> 00:54:08.659
Decision time. Ben.

880
00:54:08.693 --> 00:54:09.694
She's moving pretty fast.

881
00:54:09.729 --> 00:54:12.594
I don't know how long
that fishing line is.

882
00:54:12.628 --> 00:54:14.423
It's around his neck.

883
00:54:14.458 --> 00:54:16.322
Stay back on the porch.

884
00:54:16.356 --> 00:54:17.633
Let him go.

885
00:54:17.668 --> 00:54:19.739
Come down out of the
house and I'll cut the line.

886
00:54:19.773 --> 00:54:21.085
He'll kill you both.

887
00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:23.398
Jack-Jack. what do I do?

888
00:54:23.432 --> 00:54:25.365
Come down and take
his place and he lives.

889
00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.849
Fine. I will.

890
00:54:26.884 --> 00:54:33.339
No. son. listen to me. you don't
give these fuckers anything.

891
00:54:35.375 --> 00:54:44.729
[inaudible]

892
00:54:53.773 --> 00:55:02.437
[inaudible]

893
00:55:04.887 --> 00:55:11.066
[inaudible]

894
00:55:13.033 --> 00:55:18.073
[inaudible]

895
00:55:32.398 --> 00:55:34.607
[Screams]

896
00:55:46.826 --> 00:55:52.763
Ben. I'm so sorry
about your friend.

897
00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.386
It's my fault.

898
00:55:55.421 --> 00:55:57.664
Okay. we're not
gonna go there.

899
00:55:57.699 --> 00:56:00.426
He came here to get me.

900
00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:02.738
He wouldn't have been
here if it wasn't for me.

901
00:56:02.773 --> 00:56:04.395
You were trying to help him.

902
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:05.258
No. I wasn't.

903
00:56:05.292 --> 00:56:09.607
I was trying to
fix my own fuckup.

904
00:56:10.539 --> 00:56:11.989
I'm not a good person. Amy.

905
00:56:13.991 --> 00:56:16.407
Jack and I didn't
lose our boxing careers.

906
00:56:16.442 --> 00:56:21.654
because of my drinking.

907
00:56:21.688 --> 00:56:23.587
I cheated.

908
00:56:26.521 --> 00:56:27.867
I hurt people.

909
00:56:28.592 --> 00:56:29.662
What do you mean?

910
00:56:33.562 --> 00:56:36.220
When I first started
losing the big fights

911
00:56:36.254 --> 00:56:39.810
I thought it was because
of the partying.

912
00:56:39.844 --> 00:56:44.539
all the drinking and drugs
slowed me down. right.

913
00:56:44.573 --> 00:56:50.614
So. I sobered up.
trained harder.

914
00:56:50.648 --> 00:56:55.584
But deep down I was afraid
I just wasn't as good as

915
00:56:55.619 --> 00:56:58.553
I thought I was. and I
didn't want that to be true.

916
00:56:58.587 --> 00:57:02.039
So. I made a change.

917
00:57:02.073 --> 00:57:03.868
Jack would've
killed me if he knew.

918
00:57:03.903 --> 00:57:11.566
but I got one of my
assistant trainers

919
00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.430
to start loading my gloves.

920
00:57:15.293 --> 00:57:19.228
So he put plaster of
Paris in the wraps.

921
00:57:21.058 --> 00:57:23.578
made my fists like
a concrete block;

922
00:57:25.959 --> 00:57:27.513
I started winning.

923
00:57:29.687 --> 00:57:31.482
And the inevitable happened.

924
00:57:32.518 --> 00:57:33.588
What?

925
00:57:33.795 --> 00:57:35.935
I started really
hurting people.

926
00:57:36.867 --> 00:57:38.938
I was winning in
devastating fashion.

927
00:57:39.939 --> 00:57:45.807
I was breaking jaws.
noses. orbital bones;

928
00:57:49.949 --> 00:57:51.571
one guy lost his sight.

929
00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:59.786
I knew it was wrong.
but I was winning again.

930
00:57:59.959 --> 00:58:05.620
and Jack was happy.
I-I couldn't stop.

931
00:58:06.724 --> 00:58:13.628
And you got caught. and
Jack took the blame too.

932
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:17.839
Yeah. we both
got lifetime bans.

933
00:58:19.565 --> 00:58:23.948
And then Jack got cancer. and
then he was gonna die broke

934
00:58:23.983 --> 00:58:29.126
and-and I just got him
killed trying to fix it.

935
00:58:35.719 --> 00:58:40.965
Okay. well. you fucked
up the fighting thing.

936
00:58:43.174 --> 00:58:51.010
you did some bad shit. but
you were trying to help him.

937
00:58:51.044 --> 00:58:57.810
You didn't get Jack killed.
Mason did. blame him.

938
00:59:00.606 --> 00:59:01.676
I do.

939
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:09.580
Good. fuck him. and fuck
all those people with him.

940
00:59:09.615 --> 00:59:11.030
You're right.

941
00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.068
I'm gonna fucking kill Mason.

942
00:59:15.103 --> 00:59:16.898
No. that's not what I meant.

943
00:59:18.071 --> 00:59:23.732
[Moans in pain] Fucking
[indiscernible].

944
00:59:23.767 --> 00:59:27.149
[Moans in pain] Fuck.

945
00:59:27.184 --> 00:59:30.049
Stop it; this is exactly
what he wishes you'll do.

946
00:59:30.083 --> 00:59:31.878
[Moans in pain]
Then I'm gonna be his

947
00:59:31.913 --> 00:59:34.156
fairy-fucking-godmother.

948
00:59:34.191 --> 00:59:36.020
Fuck this.

949
00:59:36.434 --> 00:59:43.407
[Breathes heavily] Okay-okay.
you go out there and you die

950
00:59:43.441 --> 00:59:47.687
or you get eaten or whatever.

951
00:59:47.722 --> 00:59:50.034
something really bad
is gonna happen.

952
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:51.277
What are you talking about?

953
00:59:51.311 --> 00:59:54.038
Ben. I don't think that you're
just some random black guy

954
00:59:54.073 --> 00:59:55.868
they found in a bar.

955
01:00:00.873 --> 01:00:06.741
Look. [indiscernible]
September. 1969.

956
01:00:06.775 --> 01:00:09.088
your grandfather reports
something to the police.

957
01:00:09.122 --> 01:00:10.123
okay?

958
01:00:10.676 --> 01:00:12.919
October 1st. 1969.

959
01:00:12.954 --> 01:00:15.059
he dies when somebody
burns down his church.

960
01:00:15.094 --> 01:00:16.336
Yeah. we know that.

961
01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:18.166
Okay. so your dad's doing all
of this creepy -- your dad's

962
01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.962
doing all of this
creepy research.

963
01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:23.654
and then he dies
suddenly in a car crash.

964
01:00:23.689 --> 01:00:25.760
But. Ben. your father
barely drove anymore.

965
01:00:25.794 --> 01:00:27.002
I had to take him to
and from the library.

966
01:00:27.037 --> 01:00:28.452
So. it's like he
saw something.

967
01:00:28.486 --> 01:00:31.041
got spooked. and
died trying to run.

968
01:00:31.075 --> 01:00:32.180
Like he knew he was in danger.

969
01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:33.043
Exactly.

970
01:00:33.077 --> 01:00:37.150
So. he left you
combo to the safe.

971
01:00:37.185 --> 01:00:40.671
the same date as the fire.

972
01:00:42.984 --> 01:00:45.227
He needed you to
know something.

973
01:00:47.264 --> 01:00:48.990
But the will says
there was money.

974
01:00:50.854 --> 01:00:52.959
Well. I mean. you
said so yourself. Ben.

975
01:00:52.994 --> 01:00:54.754
that you weren't exactly
the greatest guy in the past.

976
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:56.273
and you hadn't kept in touch.

977
01:00:56.307 --> 01:01:01.243
So. maybe he thought this was
the only way to get you here.

978
01:01:01.278 --> 01:01:03.073
to warn you.

979
01:01:06.145 --> 01:01:07.146
Fair.

980
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:13.704
Time to open that safe.

981
01:01:17.225 --> 01:01:18.847
Let's do this.

982
01:01:18.882 --> 01:01:20.228
Be careful.

983
01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.041
What is it?

984
01:01:40.213 --> 01:01:43.907
Uh. it looks
like a-a recorder.

985
01:01:47.565 --> 01:01:50.776
Oh. and there's a
-- it's a cassette.

986
01:01:54.814 --> 01:01:56.747
It's the same date
as the police report.

987
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.199
Put it in. let's play it.

988
01:02:21.945 --> 01:02:24.775
[Exhales deeply]
It's broken.

989
01:02:26.156 --> 01:02:27.260
Looks like it.

990
01:02:38.064 --> 01:02:47.246
[Audio tape starts playing]
[Indistinct chatter]

991
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.904
This is Reverend Peter Rakes.

992
01:02:49.938 --> 01:02:53.079
The date is
September 29th. 1969.

993
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:57.049
What follows is a recording of
the exorcism of Mason Banks.

994
01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:58.326
age 36.

995
01:02:58.982 --> 01:03:00.811
Present with me are
Mason and his mother.

996
01:03:00.846 --> 01:03:01.950
Ethel Banks.

997
01:03:01.985 --> 01:03:03.849
Please. hurry.

998
01:03:03.883 --> 01:03:06.161
[Breathes heavily]
Untie me.

999
01:03:06.196 --> 01:03:08.612
Mason. your mother and
I are trying to help you.

1000
01:03:08.646 --> 01:03:10.096
An exorcism?

1001
01:03:10.131 --> 01:03:12.098
You're not Catholic priest.

1002
01:03:12.133 --> 01:03:13.962
I am god's servant.

1003
01:03:13.997 --> 01:03:16.378
A lonely Baptist in
a crumbling church.

1004
01:03:16.413 --> 01:03:19.830
Let me look closer at
you [indiscernible].

1005
01:03:19.865 --> 01:03:20.969
Uh. how is he doing that?

1006
01:03:21.004 --> 01:03:22.868
Don't look at it.
read with me.

1007
01:03:22.902 --> 01:03:25.629
Be strong in the lord. for we
do not wrestle against flesh

1008
01:03:25.663 --> 01:03:27.942
and blood. but against
the cosmic powers

1009
01:03:27.976 --> 01:03:29.909
over the present darkness.

1010
01:03:29.944 --> 01:03:31.048
Stop. wait.

1011
01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:36.882
[Laughs] Why have been
[indiscernible] yourself to me.

1012
01:03:37.365 --> 01:03:40.955
He spit and step on
your Nazarenes cross.

1013
01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:43.198
he called out to me.

1014
01:03:43.233 --> 01:03:44.234
You lie.

1015
01:03:44.268 --> 01:03:46.995
He wanted the
power to hurt you.

1016
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:48.928
He hates you.

1017
01:03:48.963 --> 01:03:49.273
What?

1018
01:03:49.308 --> 01:03:50.550
Why?

1019
01:03:50.585 --> 01:03:56.660
You're no church integration.
Negroes praying with whites.

1020
01:03:56.694 --> 01:04:00.284
the boys will ensure
the power to destroy you.

1021
01:04:00.319 --> 01:04:03.460
I did you a
favor by taking him.

1022
01:04:03.494 --> 01:04:09.224
Our father in heaven. hallowed
be thy name -- get off her.

1023
01:04:09.259 --> 01:04:15.472
Keep fighting
[Screams]

1024
01:04:15.506 --> 01:04:18.993
My teeth are dull. but strong.

1025
01:04:19.234 --> 01:04:22.375
You killed her [indiscernible]
-- [Indiscernible] reverend.

1026
01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:24.412
this boy will eat
your living flesh.

1027
01:04:24.446 --> 01:04:26.069
That will not happen.

1028
01:04:26.103 --> 01:04:31.039
If not you. then
your son or his son.

1029
01:04:31.074 --> 01:04:35.457
this is my promise. I curse.

1030
01:04:35.492 --> 01:04:40.117
I shall reward the boy with
unimaginable power

1031
01:04:40.152 --> 01:04:43.293
once he has tasted your
family's living flesh.

1032
01:04:43.327 --> 01:04:47.366
Stay back. in the
name Jesus Christ.

1033
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.368
See you soon. reverend.

1034
01:04:49.402 --> 01:04:53.372
Mason. wait-wait.

1035
01:04:57.169 --> 01:05:01.380
[Audio tape stops playing]

1036
01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:05.246
Fuck.

1037
01:05:08.387 --> 01:05:09.422
Fuck.

1038
01:05:13.461 --> 01:05:17.534
Ben-Ben. can you hear me?

1039
01:05:20.157 --> 01:05:21.262
Come on out.

1040
01:05:24.092 --> 01:05:29.166
I'll cook you in there like
we did with your granddaddy.

1041
01:05:29.201 --> 01:05:31.997
[Laughs] You motherfucker.

1042
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:37.416
[Screams]

1043
01:05:40.177 --> 01:05:42.041
What do we do now. Ben?

1044
01:05:46.011 --> 01:05:48.047
Shit. here we go.

1045
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:59.576
So. you staying in or
you coming out. Ben?

1046
01:06:02.579 --> 01:06:05.444
If you come out
I'll spare the girl.

1047
01:06:06.548 --> 01:06:09.551
Go fuck yourself.
you fucking fuck.

1048
01:06:09.586 --> 01:06:11.001
Amy?
What?

1049
01:06:11.036 --> 01:06:12.244
Quiet.

1050
01:06:12.278 --> 01:06:13.107
What?

1051
01:06:13.141 --> 01:06:14.384
You'll let the girl go?

1052
01:06:20.183 --> 01:06:21.322
I'll think about it.

1053
01:06:31.194 --> 01:06:32.436
Now you can't be serious?

1054
01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:34.197
I'm not.

1055
01:06:34.231 --> 01:06:36.993
I have a plan.

1056
01:06:44.586 --> 01:06:46.312
I'm not gonna fight.

1057
01:06:46.485 --> 01:06:48.142
We're not.

1058
01:06:48.176 --> 01:06:50.316
Jay's car is still
here. I've got the keys.

1059
01:06:50.351 --> 01:06:52.180
I'll go out there and distract
them while you make a

1060
01:06:52.215 --> 01:06:53.354
run for the car.

1061
01:06:53.388 --> 01:06:55.425
Fuck that. I'm not
leaving you alone.

1062
01:06:55.459 --> 01:06:58.497
Well. then what. Amy.
what are you gonna do?

1063
01:06:58.531 --> 01:07:00.844
You're gonna stay
here and die in a fire.

1064
01:07:00.878 --> 01:07:03.467
screaming like my grandfather
while those fuckers watch.

1065
01:07:03.502 --> 01:07:05.193
If you go outside and get
eaten alive something fucked

1066
01:07:05.228 --> 01:07:07.057
is gonna happen.
Mason is gonna have.

1067
01:07:07.092 --> 01:07:10.578
fucking. godlike powers;
you really want that?

1068
01:07:10.612 --> 01:07:12.166
At least you might
get out of here.

1069
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.236
Stop it.

1070
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:14.478
I know you wanna
be a good guy.

1071
01:07:14.513 --> 01:07:16.446
Ben. but this
isn't how you do it.

1072
01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:20.588
No.

1073
01:07:23.211 --> 01:07:26.042
Wait. you're wrong.

1074
01:07:26.663 --> 01:07:27.526
What?

1075
01:07:28.665 --> 01:07:30.632
I'm not a good guy.

1076
01:07:33.152 --> 01:07:35.120
We've been doing
this all wrong.

1077
01:07:35.327 --> 01:07:37.605
acting exactly the
way Mason wants.

1078
01:07:37.639 --> 01:07:39.365
like my father
and my grandfather.

1079
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.299
being scared.
trying to escape.

1080
01:07:42.334 --> 01:07:44.129
asking why is this happening.

1081
01:07:44.163 --> 01:07:45.164
Right.

1082
01:07:45.199 --> 01:07:47.097
Well. who the fuck
cares why it's happening.

1083
01:07:47.132 --> 01:07:49.272
Mason wants us out
there so he could eat us.

1084
01:07:49.306 --> 01:07:52.689
Well. fuck him.
let's not do that.

1085
01:07:52.723 --> 01:07:55.657
Let's handle this
like cheating fucks.

1086
01:07:56.313 --> 01:07:57.590
How do we do that?

1087
01:07:57.625 --> 01:08:00.214
Change the rules.

1088
01:08:00.248 --> 01:08:03.320
They wanna eat us; well. they
have to come in here to do it.

1089
01:08:03.355 --> 01:08:05.150
on our turf.

1090
01:08:05.184 --> 01:08:07.083
And we'll be ready.

1091
01:08:07.738 --> 01:08:10.120
I mean. it's an
idea. but. I mean.

1092
01:08:10.155 --> 01:08:13.537
isn't it holy ground.
they can't come inside.

1093
01:08:13.572 --> 01:08:15.677
Then we'll make it unholy.

1094
01:08:44.258 --> 01:08:47.364
[Breathes heavily]
You ready?

1095
01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.746
No. but whatever.

1096
01:08:50.781 --> 01:08:52.369
You think we can do this?

1097
01:08:52.404 --> 01:08:53.612
No.

1098
01:08:53.646 --> 01:08:54.785
Fuck.

1099
01:08:56.235 --> 01:08:58.341
Look. the keys are in my
gym bag if they get me first.

1100
01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:00.205
No. that better
not fucking happen.

1101
01:09:01.551 --> 01:09:04.278
You know you swear a
lot for a librarian. right?

1102
01:09:04.726 --> 01:09:06.728
My career is not a
personality trait.

1103
01:09:09.317 --> 01:09:10.422
Yeah. okay.

1104
01:09:11.595 --> 01:09:16.462
[Exhales deeply]
Here we go.

1105
01:09:30.545 --> 01:09:31.650
What's up. Mason?

1106
01:09:32.444 --> 01:09:33.652
Are you coming out. Ben?

1107
01:09:35.378 --> 01:09:36.758
I got a question for you.

1108
01:09:38.312 --> 01:09:41.246
We just listened to
a exorcism podcast.

1109
01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.731
heard you talking
about eating my family.

1110
01:09:44.594 --> 01:09:46.803
and that demons
would bless you for it.

1111
01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:51.221
Well. I can't help. but
notice that there hasn't

1112
01:09:51.256 --> 01:09:52.533
been much eating.

1113
01:09:53.603 --> 01:09:55.674
My grandfather
died in a house fire.

1114
01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.746
and my father
died in a car crash.

1115
01:09:59.678 --> 01:10:03.544
so this cannibalism
or insurance fraud?

1116
01:10:05.684 --> 01:10:08.342
Does the rest of your little
cult know what a loser you are.

1117
01:10:08.376 --> 01:10:09.653
huh?

1118
01:10:10.516 --> 01:10:13.726
You must really
wanna eat me. Mason.

1119
01:10:14.658 --> 01:10:19.698
I'm the last Rakes.
your only chance.

1120
01:10:21.631 --> 01:10:23.219
Last chance to come out.

1121
01:10:25.807 --> 01:10:27.602
[Laughs]
That won't help you.

1122
01:10:33.436 --> 01:10:34.540
Oops.

1123
01:10:35.403 --> 01:10:40.650
[Spits]
I desecrate this land.

1124
01:10:41.789 --> 01:10:51.350
I spit and step on the cross.
revoking it as god's house.

1125
01:11:24.935 --> 01:11:27.731
[Breathes heavily]
They did it.

1126
01:12:17.402 --> 01:12:25.513
[Screams]
Amy?

1127
01:12:25.686 --> 01:12:28.930
[Screams]
Fuck.

1128
01:12:28.965 --> 01:12:34.488
[Screams]

1129
01:12:35.834 --> 01:12:38.906
[Screams]

1130
01:12:41.771 --> 01:12:42.944
[Yells] Amy!

1131
01:12:43.635 --> 01:12:46.707
[Moans with pain]

1132
01:12:48.674 --> 01:12:50.849
You honestly thought
you could avoid this?

1133
01:12:51.712 --> 01:12:54.508
[Indistinct chatter]
[Moans with pain]

1134
01:12:54.542 --> 01:12:55.750
Where are you going?

1135
01:12:57.442 --> 01:12:59.961
[Moans with pain]

1136
01:12:59.996 --> 01:13:01.722
You thought you
could beat me.

1137
01:13:02.447 --> 01:13:05.381
[Screams]

1138
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:08.901
When I raise my
hand I can feel the stars.

1139
01:13:09.868 --> 01:13:11.939
I can dip my foot down into hell

1140
01:13:11.973 --> 01:13:14.390
and feel the damned
kiss my feet.

1141
01:13:14.666 --> 01:13:17.841
Imagine what I'll be
capable of once I consume you.

1142
01:13:18.014 --> 01:13:22.467
[Inhales deeply]
I will be a god.

1143
01:13:23.053 --> 01:13:36.619
[Moans with pain]
[Breathes heavily]

1144
01:13:37.689 --> 01:13:38.724
It's all right.

1145
01:13:40.036 --> 01:13:41.865
I was never gonna let her go.

1146
01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:47.492
[Grunts] [Screams]
[Moans with pain]

1147
01:13:47.526 --> 01:13:52.600
[Breathes heavily]

1148
01:13:58.606 --> 01:14:03.024
Do you know how long I have
waited to taste your flesh?

1149
01:14:04.819 --> 01:14:10.238
To hear you scream. to
be granted my power.

1150
01:14:11.101 --> 01:14:13.794
[Exhales deeply]

1151
01:14:13.828 --> 01:14:16.969
You gonna keep talking about
it or you gonna do it?

1152
01:14:18.074 --> 01:14:24.977
[Screams]
[Moans with pain]

1153
01:14:37.093 --> 01:14:40.993
You feel good. Mason. godlike?

1154
01:14:46.827 --> 01:14:48.656
What have you done?

1155
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:50.589
Bad things.

1156
01:14:51.556 --> 01:14:54.904
See. you're so used to
hurting good people

1157
01:14:54.938 --> 01:14:58.666
you weren't ready for a
bad motherfucker.

1158
01:15:01.566 --> 01:15:02.843
Where is Ben Rakes?

1159
01:15:04.983 --> 01:15:10.713
Spending 30 days in rehab.
I'm his AA sponsor.

1160
01:15:11.852 --> 01:15:14.820
When his dad died he
fell off the wagon.

1161
01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.064
so I took him to AA.

1162
01:15:17.996 --> 01:15:21.862
On the way. he kept babbling
about his dad's will

1163
01:15:21.896 --> 01:15:23.795
and money in his safe.

1164
01:15:25.003 --> 01:15:26.936
I was the wrong guy to tell.

1165
01:15:28.385 --> 01:15:30.905
So. I broke into his
place. stole the will.

1166
01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.044
and here I am.

1167
01:15:33.114 --> 01:15:37.015
I told you. Mason.
I like disappointing you.

1168
01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:44.885
[Grunts]

Let's go.

1176
01:17:12.351 --> 01:17:14.871
[Breathes heavily]
Fuck.

[Heavy breathing] Okay.

1180
01:17:29.058 --> 01:17:34.132
[Breathes heavily] Okay.

1181
01:17:37.273 --> 01:17:40.310
So. what is your name anyway?

1182
01:17:41.208 --> 01:17:43.072
