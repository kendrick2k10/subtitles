This is the shed shot.

9
00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.756
I still don't know why
we decided to ever film it.

10
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.527
This next shot is called
roof-alama-ding-dong.

11
00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.331
Basketball goal was $80.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.501

We're always trying to do
something new.

49
00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.637
So we thought.
can we do this live?

50
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.738
Should we talk about
the DP Live tour?

51
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.805
- I think we should.
- Wow!

52
00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.509

70
00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:52.965
- So. this thing's happening?
- That's what I said.
I think it's real.

71
00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:55.701
So we're gonna drop that
in down your back and this
is gonna stay up top.

72

- Okay.
- Shake your head.
Jump up and down.

Cody:<i> I think that this tour
is without a doubt</i>

74
00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:04.844
<i> the biggest risk
Dude Perfect's ever made.</i>

75
00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:07.647
We've literally never done
anything like this.

76
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.483
Are we ready to jump in?
Oh. no!

77
00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.317
Garrett:<i>
We're doing 21 shows.</i>

78
00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:14.053
<i> First one kicks off
in San Diego.</i>

79
00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:18.457
- San Diego!
- Am I saying that right?
San "Di-ago"?

80
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.792
- Is that where we are?
- Yeah!

81
00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:22.295
And today's the first day
of rehearsal.

82
00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:24.462
- You look like a huge weirdo.
- Dude.

83
00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:26.632
All right.
this is the first battle.

84
00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:28.868
Make some noise
if you guys are excited!

85
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:31.570
Coby:<i>
We're 90% sold out right now.</i>

86
00:04:31.603 --> 00:04:34.774
Somewhere around
120.000 tickets. which is crazy.

87
00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:37.843
Cody:<i> Everything we've done
is behind a camera</i>

88
00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:39.811
<i> and it can always be edited.</i>

89
00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:42.448
- Short.
- Oh. man!

90
00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:44.850
- We just disconnected.
- We should probably stop that.

91
00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:47.753
So for this tour.
it's gonna be raw and real

92
00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:49.689
<i> and are people gonna like it?</i>

93
00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:51.957
There's just a lot
of unknowns.

94
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.428
- What are we doing?
- Did you guys want to go
on tour. like. next week?

95
00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:58.030
- Yeah.
- That's what it says
at the top of the page.

96
00:04:58.063 --> 00:04:59.565
- Yeah.
- Cory:<i> We've come up with</i>

97
00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:01.334
<i> pretty much everything
for the tour.</i>

98
00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:03.469
<i> We are working with
a great touring company</i>

99
00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:05.905
'cause we don't know how to do
a full-fledged live show.

100
00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.941
This is the day to. like.
stop. ask questions.

101
00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:11.409
If we don't like how
something's feeling.

102
00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:16.082
let's bring that to surface
today so we can address it
prior to San Diego.

103
00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:19.485
Tyler:<i> We're essentially
taking the best parts of all
of our YouTube videos</i>

104
00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:21.753
<i> and combining them
into one live show.</i>

105
00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:23.022
<i> So we'll be doing
some live battles...</i>

106
00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:25.725
( yelling. laughing )

107
00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:27.359
<i> some trick shots...</i>

108
00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:29.895
Yeah!

109
00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:32.732
...and then some of the fan
favorites from the "Overtime"
series that we do as well.

110
00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.001
Oh!

111
00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.139
Welcome to "Overtime!"
Hopefully it goes well.

112
00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:41.974
You've seen the "Overtime" desk.

113
00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:44.744
It's basically the same one
as upstairs.

114
00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:48.147
and then we've split it
into three sides. so...

115
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.850
- No way.
- It's not happening.

116
00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:55.421
- Ten bucks if you do it.
- Oh. he did it! He did it!

117
00:05:55.454 --> 00:05:58.924
- Let's go! Let's go!
- ( overlapping shouting )

118
00:05:58.957 --> 00:05:59.992
- Boom!
- There were casualties.

119
00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:01.960
Was it worth it?
I think so.

120
00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:05.865
I spiked my chicken biscuit.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

121
00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:08.901
Jeff:<i> People ask me.
"What is it like to represent
the Dude Perfect guys?"</i>

122
00:06:08.934 --> 00:06:11.036
Well. to me. it's very easy

123
00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.073
because what you see
is what you get.

124
00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:17.143
<i> They're the same guys
when the camera's not rolling.</i>

125
00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:20.613
You know I can show up
at your house uninvited and
I wouldn't even think twice.

126
00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.815
- Please do not do that.
- I might. Okay. well...

127
00:06:22.848 --> 00:06:26.185
<i> They're crazy and fun
and competitive</i>

128
00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:28.421
<i> and all of those things
rolled into one.</i>

129
00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:30.623
Tyler:<i>
I'm definitely excited.</i>

130
00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:33.759
<i> They five of us
living together on a bus?
It'll be like college.</i>

131
00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:36.128
Being roommates.
that's kinda how we started
all this in the first place.

132
00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:41.534
<i> We all met at Texas A&M.</i>

133
00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.868
Had a wonderful experience

134
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:44.570
meeting the twins
for the first time.

135
00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:46.705
<i> Showed up at their house.</i>

136
00:06:46.738 --> 00:06:48.574
they are learning
the Soulja Boy dance

137
00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:50.176
on their projector.

138
00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:53.112
And I walk in and they're doing
the "Crank That" Soulja Boy.

139
00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:54.680
and I'm like.
"So these are the guys

140
00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:57.883
you've been hanging out
with at school? Okay.

141
00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.553
I mean. I guess I can get
on board with that."

142
00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:04.190
Coby:<i> We ended up living
together with Tyler and Cory
and me in the house.</i>

143
00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:05.758
Garrett was too clean for us.
He was down the street.

144
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.827
Garrett.
let me show you something.

145
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.094
Garrett:<i> Basically.
I spent the whole day there.</i>

146
00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:11.564
but they were just
too messy for me.

147
00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.899
Like. one day I remember
going in there.

148
00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:16.202
and I had to wash the dishes
before I could even
hang out with them.

149
00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.771
I can't do this. man.
I'm too stressed out.

150
00:07:18.804 --> 00:07:20.573
( chuckles )

151
00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:23.476
We needed one more roommate.
and Cody Jones squeaked in

152
00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.778
by the skin of his teeth.

153
00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:28.481
Cody:<i> I met the twins
through playing basketball
at the rec center.</i>

154
00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:31.684
I'm telling you right now.
I was almost embarrassed
to say that I knew them

155
00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:34.587
because they had the
straight chili bowl haircuts.

156
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.056
This is. like. sophomore.
junior year of college.

157
00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.492
Coby:<i> The definition
of a bowl cut.</i>

158
00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:41.960
We're talking "High School
Musical" Zac Efron days.

159
00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:44.864
<i> and so people thought
that was a cool haircut.</i>

160
00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:46.932
Tyler:<i>
So you have a tall goofy guy.</i>

161
00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:48.767
<i> you have two twins that just
moved out of their mom's house.</i>

162
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.236
-<i> a clean freak... </i>
- Yeah!

163
00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:51.570
<i> ...and me.
a guy who would probably</i>

164
00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:52.872
<i> rather live in the woods.</i>

165
00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:55.241
You know what kind
of ducks those are?

166
00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:57.910
Cinnamon Teal
and a green wing teal.

167
00:07:57.943 --> 00:07:59.777
<i> On paper. it shouldn't have
really worked.</i>

168
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:01.780
<i> but for some reason.
we just clicked.</i>

169
00:08:01.813 --> 00:08:04.517
( overlapping chatter )

170
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.952
<i> We were always making up
these weird competitive games</i>

171
00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:08.287
<i> just for something to do.</i>

172
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.055
<i> We had this game called
Hustle Ball</i>

173
00:08:10.088 --> 00:08:11.891
where two people would sit
on a couch.

174
00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:13.292
and you'd have to sit
on your hands

175
00:08:13.325 --> 00:08:14.860
and then somebody would throw
a football

176
00:08:14.893 --> 00:08:16.794
right in between you guys.

177
00:08:16.828 --> 00:08:20.832
( overlapping chatter )

178
00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:25.971
It was a free-for-all.
First person to get
the football is the winner.

179
00:08:26.004 --> 00:08:27.640
Toney in the second round.

180
00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.909
Coby:<i> I don't think Ty
went to class.</i>

181
00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:34.280
We would get home and he would
have some ridiculous idea
for something to do.

182
00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:36.881
One day Garrett and I were like.
"Well. hey. let's go get
a basketball goal."

183
00:08:36.914 --> 00:08:38.183
Garrett:<i>
We didn't have a driveway.</i>

184
00:08:38.216 --> 00:08:40.619
<i> So we just put it
in the backyard</i>

185
00:08:40.652 --> 00:08:43.155
<i> right on the grass
and just started playing
backyard basketball.</i>

186
00:08:43.188 --> 00:08:44.823
Whoa!

187
00:08:44.856 --> 00:08:48.093
One thing led to another
and we started filming 'em.

188
00:08:48.126 --> 00:08:51.297
Coby:<i>
And we're all just trying
to top the last guy.</i>

189
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.266
- Boom!
- So we posted it on
Cory's YouTube channel

190
00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:56.235
because none of us
had a YouTube channel.

191
00:08:56.268 --> 00:09:00.172
We sent it out to all
of our family and friends
on email.

192
00:09:00.205 --> 00:09:02.575
Obviously just for fun.
but we put a little bit

193
00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:03.876
of time into it.
so we wanted people to see it.

194
00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:05.843
We went to sleep.
no big deal.

195
00:09:05.877 --> 00:09:07.646
We woke up the next morning

196
00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:09.648
<i> and it hit
"Sports Illustrated's" website.</i>

197
00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:11.250
<i> And we were freaking out
and we were searching for it</i>

198
00:09:11.283 --> 00:09:12.885
and seeing it was on
all these different blogs.

199
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:17.022
It felt like it was everywhere.

200
00:09:17.055 --> 00:09:19.324
<i> Sports sites. blogs.
morning shows.</i>

201
00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:22.227
We were running around
screaming like little girls.
we were so excited.

202
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.229
Coby:<i> Made a couple more
videos after that</i>

203
00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:26.998
<i> and they were just continuing
to get more and more views.</i>

204
00:09:27.032 --> 00:09:28.968
( cheering )

205
00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:30.703
We just felt like we were
on to something.

206
00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.771
<i> and we just wanted to keep
making fun videos.</i>

207
00:09:35.073 --> 00:09:37.643
- ( cheering )
- Yeah!

208
00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:39.878
You don't
keep people's attention
and keep them coming back

209
00:09:39.911 --> 00:09:41.946
by giving them the same thing
over and over again.

210
00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.983
<i> so each video had to be
better than the last.</i>

211
00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:46.017
<i> and that's honestly been
our philosophy ever since.</i>

212
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:48.320
Coby:<i> We do not want to do
something you've seen before.</i>

213
00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:50.122
We want to make sure
that it feels new.

214
00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:51.890
Yeehaw!

215
00:09:51.923 --> 00:09:53.158
Cody:<i> We are always
looking to go bigger.</i>

216
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:54.961
and that applies
to everything we do.

217
00:09:57.796 --> 00:10:00.933
- We appreciate y'all coming.
- Well. this is gonna be fun.

218
00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:04.336
- Yeah.
- Jeff: On behalf of all
the Dude Perfect guys.

219
00:10:04.369 --> 00:10:06.805
thank you so much
for taking your time
to come out tonight.

220
00:10:06.838 --> 00:10:09.908
As you know.
we're getting ready to kick off
our first ever live tour.

221
00:10:09.941 --> 00:10:15.247
so what we wanna do
is we wanna rehearse in front
of friendly family.

222
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.848
- Right?
- So no heckling?

223
00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:18.651
- So no what?
- Heckling.

224
00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:20.118
- You can heckle if you want.
- Where's the comment box?

225
00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:21.954
There will be hecklers.
so we need to see it.

226
00:10:21.987 --> 00:10:24.089
I'm sure the wives will heckle
once they get home privately.

227
00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:26.157
We need to feel it.
I respect it.

228
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:29.728
Bethany:
I literally have heard
zero about this tour.

229
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:31.396
Kristin:
Garrett debriefed me last night.

230
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.766
- Garrett always debriefs you.
- He does. he does.

231
00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.300
- He keeps me in the loop.
- I have to ask Kristin

232
00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:37.269
for all the information
regarding Dude Perfect.

233
00:10:37.302 --> 00:10:39.238
- Hey. Bob-Bob.
How are you. buddy boy?
- How are you?

234
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:41.106
- Doing good.
Enjoy the show.
- Cody.

235
00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:42.908
- Enjoy the show.
- Good to see you. Thank you.

236
00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:44.977
Keep expectations low. folks.
Keep 'em low.

237
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.080
Mykael: Ladies and gentlemen.
please stand to your feet

238
00:10:48.113 --> 00:10:53.319
and help me welcome
your starting five!

239
00:10:57.322 --> 00:10:59.958
Thank you. guys.
Thank you!

240
00:10:59.991 --> 00:11:02.995
Truly. I did not have any idea

241
00:11:03.028 --> 00:11:04.396
about what this tour
was gonna be like

242
00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:07.165
<i> until we saw the preview
as a family.</i>

243
00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:10.202
Oh. no. Oh. Pierce.
Oh. no!

244
00:11:10.235 --> 00:11:13.772
- He's gonna have to get PB&J'D.
- That's what I thought.

245
00:11:13.805 --> 00:11:17.276
Kristin:<i>
I did ask him the other day.
you know. will you be nervous</i>

246
00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:19.011
on stage in front
of all those people?

247
00:11:19.044 --> 00:11:21.146
Y'all have done it before.
but you're going live.

248
00:11:21.179 --> 00:11:25.851
Garrett:<i>
I can't really picture 8.000
people just in front of you.</i>

249
00:11:25.884 --> 00:11:27.986
You know. that's kinda--

250
00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:29.755
it's going to take me
a little bit of getting used to.

251
00:11:29.788 --> 00:11:31.223
You knew this day
was coming. Ty.

252
00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:32.824
We're talking about
your rage issues. buddy.

253
00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.358
Oh. I don't--
those are long gone.

254
00:11:34.392 --> 00:11:36.261
I mean. when was
the last time I raged?
Like. a year ago?

255
00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:38.396
Allison:<i>
Cody. he kinda shines
in the live events.</i>

256
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.498
<i> Like. that's kinda like--
that's his personality.</i>

257
00:11:40.532 --> 00:11:42.501
So I think he's excited
just to do something different.

258
00:11:42.534 --> 00:11:44.336
- I think they all are.
- ( screaming )

259
00:11:44.369 --> 00:11:47.039
No! No. Ty!
What are you doing?

260
00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:50.042
Oh. my-- oh! Oh!

261
00:11:50.075 --> 00:11:52.444
- We'll work on that.
- Oh. oh!

262
00:11:52.477 --> 00:11:54.246
He just hit me with a guitar!

263
00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:56.181
Allison:<i>
Seeing it live is really fun</i>

264
00:11:56.214 --> 00:11:58.183
<i> because. like. we don't ever
get to see that part of it.</i>

265
00:11:58.216 --> 00:11:59.485
So it's super exciting.
We get to watch what--

266
00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.854
- Yeah. they do it every day.
- Yeah.

267
00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.856
Like. he thinks it's his
normal life. but I'm like--

268
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:05.357
- This is not normal.
- I don't--

269
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:09.093
Okay. guys. that is what
we have for you tonight.

270
00:12:09.127 --> 00:12:11.063
Do you think this
is gonna work?

271
00:12:11.096 --> 00:12:13.465
- Yeah!
- We're still not sure.
to be totally honest.

272
00:12:13.498 --> 00:12:16.869
We don't know.
but this is what we got. so...

273
00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.437
I thought they did
a really great job.

274
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.973
Yeah. it was good.
It was funny.

275
00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:24.510
Jeff: Thank you so much.
We're really excited
about the show.

276
00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:27.012
Obviously we're going
to be gone a long time.

277
00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:30.415
And what we'd like to do
is bring the guys out here

278
00:12:30.448 --> 00:12:33.919
and just ask God
to watch over us

279
00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:35.921
and allow us to do
the best that we can.

280
00:12:35.954 --> 00:12:39.925
And we will start off
by praying a special blessing

281
00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:44.196
on this incredible team
as they launch from home

282
00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:47.065
that each of us would go
with them in our hearts.

283
00:12:47.098 --> 00:12:50.902
in our prayers.
and in our support.

284
00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:54.940
- We pray this in Jesus' name.
- All: Amen.

285
00:12:54.973 --> 00:12:58.577
Tyler:<i> I feel pretty good
about the overall show.</i>

286
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.047
I still think once we get
out there on the real stage
with the real lights.

287
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.550
<i> it's gonna be a completely
different experience.</i>

288
00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:07.352
<i> Having the families here
is awesome and great.</i>

289
00:13:07.385 --> 00:13:09.922
but they're pretty supportive
of us in general.

290
00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:13.125
so they're not really gonna
give us great feedback

291
00:13:13.158 --> 00:13:15.460
for how well the show's
gonna actually go.

292
00:13:15.493 --> 00:13:17.396
I think they'll do
a tremendous job.

293
00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:23.401
and I think the audience
will respond really well.

294
00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:25.337
Tyler:<i>
It's about to be go-time.</i>

295
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.475
Here we go.
and we're on the hook
for 21 shows. so...

296
00:13:37.883 --> 00:13:41.453
What up. guys?
We are about to head out
on our first ever live tour.

297
00:13:41.486 --> 00:13:44.089
20 cities. Here we go.

298
00:13:44.122 --> 00:13:45.591
Got the bags packed.
Cobes. you hyped?

299
00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:47.993
- Whoo! Let's do it.
- Here we go.

300
00:13:48.026 --> 00:13:51.029
Yeehaw! Here we are.

301
00:13:51.062 --> 00:13:52.564
We're headed to California.
It's tour time. boys.

302
00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:54.567
- What are we doing. man?
- Let's do it!

303
00:14:01.039 --> 00:14:04.141
- Morning. Ryan.
- All right. today is the day.

304
00:14:04.175 --> 00:14:08.214
First show of 22
here in San Diego.

305
00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:26.164
- It's game day.
- Cody:<i> Now that the show
is put together.</i>

306
00:14:26.197 --> 00:14:28.967
<i>the only thing that I'm nervous
on is. like. will it play?</i>

307
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.335
I just don't want it
to land flat. right?

308
00:14:30.368 --> 00:14:32.304
Like I can see it
in a YouTube video.

309
00:14:32.337 --> 00:14:36.008
but in a huge arena.
I don't know.

310
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.644
-<i> ( bass rumbling ) </i>
- You hear that rumble?

311
00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:41.446
Oh. they're gonna cue it up
perfectly for us to walk in.

312
00:14:41.479 --> 00:14:43.415
- My gosh.
- Oh!

313
00:14:43.448 --> 00:14:45.016
<i> ( music playing )</i>

314
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.486
( laughing )

315
00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:50.222
Mykael: Ladies and gentlemen.
please stand to your feet

316
00:14:50.255 --> 00:14:55.994
and help me welcome
your starting five!

317
00:14:56.027 --> 00:14:57.262
-<i> ( music playing ) </i>
- Oh!

318
00:14:57.295 --> 00:14:59.598
- Oh. my.
- ( no audible dialogue )

319
00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:04.169
- That's insane.
- That's insane.

320
00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:07.973
<i> ( music continues )</i>

321
00:15:08.006 --> 00:15:10.608
Whoo. boys! It's happening.

322
00:15:10.642 --> 00:15:12.577
Yeah. we going on tour. boy.

323
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.080
Tyler:<i> It's kind of like
a real production.</i>

324
00:15:15.113 --> 00:15:19.651
<i> We got people pressing buttons
on slides. running lights.
building props.</i>

325
00:15:19.684 --> 00:15:23.121
What would happen though
if I just did that?

326
00:15:23.154 --> 00:15:25.057
A couple of these.
a couple of those.

327
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.359
Yeah. I mean.
look at this thing.
This is the set-up.

328
00:15:27.392 --> 00:15:30.028
Well. you know what I appreciate
more than the coffee bar

329
00:15:30.061 --> 00:15:31.630
is the sign
in the coffee bar.

330
00:15:31.663 --> 00:15:33.598
Once we're 15 shows in.

331
00:15:33.631 --> 00:15:36.001
it's gonna be nice
to have a little reminder

332
00:15:36.034 --> 00:15:37.602
of where you're actually at.

333
00:15:37.635 --> 00:15:39.705
I really think we should
probably get rehearsing.

334
00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:41.373
I'm a little nervous about it.

335
00:15:41.406 --> 00:15:45.343
- What is up. San Diego?
- Whoo!

336
00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:48.012
- That is loud.
- That is loud. Gar.

337
00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:50.148
- I am.
- Give it to me.

338
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:52.584
Oh! Oh!

339
00:15:52.617 --> 00:15:54.553
- Yeah. you look good.
- Yeah. you look good.

340
00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:58.256
- It's still scary.
- Yeah. it is.
Now go jump over that.

341
00:15:58.289 --> 00:16:00.726
- Oh. God.
- Yeah.

342
00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:04.696
- Yeah. good luck getting up.
- Ah! No. no. no!

343
00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:07.099
- ( grunting )
- Oh. God.

344
00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:10.267
( all grunting )

345
00:16:10.301 --> 00:16:13.071
Jeff:<i> I think the guys
are good live performers.</i>

346
00:16:13.104 --> 00:16:14.506
<i> Practice performers--
not so much.</i>

347
00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:16.174
- Go!
- ( grunting )

348
00:16:16.207 --> 00:16:17.509
But when you've got.
like. 7.000 people

349
00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:19.277
<i> sitting right there
in front of you</i>

350
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.213
<i> expecting to be entertained
100% of the time.</i>

351
00:16:21.246 --> 00:16:24.249
great on the fly
may not be the best approach.

352
00:16:24.282 --> 00:16:26.652
- ( shouting )
- ( grunting )

353
00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:32.290
- You almost died.
- Did you just land
on your face?

354
00:16:32.323 --> 00:16:34.793
- I landed on my shoulder.
- Medic!

355
00:16:34.826 --> 00:16:37.362
Okay. great. You guys ready
to roll that again?

356
00:16:37.395 --> 00:16:39.631
- Yeah. let's try that again.
- We'll start the entire
run-through top to bottom.

357
00:16:39.664 --> 00:16:41.699
- ( screaming )
- One. two...

358
00:16:41.733 --> 00:16:43.435
<i> They never practice
trick shots.</i>

359
00:16:43.468 --> 00:16:45.804
<i> Just do it.
Same thing with. like. a tour.</i>

360
00:16:45.837 --> 00:16:48.073
You guys are gonna have to
get together and spin the same.

361
00:16:48.106 --> 00:16:49.641
There's a lot of winging it.

362
00:16:49.674 --> 00:16:52.778
- ( overlapping shouting )
- Hug it out. Hug it out.

363
00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:55.213
<i> We're very Last-Minute Larry.
So there's no script.</i>

364
00:16:55.246 --> 00:16:58.550
<i> There's no plan.
It's us just going
with the flow.</i>

365
00:16:58.583 --> 00:17:02.120
Who's ready to witness
a world record attempt?

366
00:17:02.153 --> 00:17:05.190
- How are you feeling?
- I'm feeling like these lemons
are very poorly spaced.

367
00:17:05.223 --> 00:17:07.526
- Yeah. this isn't gonna work.
- Somebody take this.

368
00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.728
- Hey. let's give him a plaque.
- Do we have the plaque?

369
00:17:09.761 --> 00:17:12.097
We need to practice
that stuff.

370
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.433
I feel like we're not really
ready for rehearsal.
to be honest with you.

371
00:17:14.465 --> 00:17:16.801
Is that just me?
Anybody else feel that way?

372
00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:19.171
( sighs )
What is happening?

373
00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:21.473
- I don't know.
- That whole table set-up
is not gonna work.

374
00:17:21.506 --> 00:17:23.575
- No. I know.
We gotta get a new table.
- We gotta tell 'em.

375
00:17:23.608 --> 00:17:25.210
Coby: I'm stressed
right now. honestly.

376
00:17:25.242 --> 00:17:27.812
We got a lot of details
that just aren't working.

377
00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:30.749
Jeff: We're trying to pull
everything together before
tonight's show and stuff.

378
00:17:30.782 --> 00:17:34.252
But. like.
plaques need to be ready
to go for Absurd Recurds.

379
00:17:34.285 --> 00:17:36.188
We need to fire
T-shirt cannons.

380
00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:38.657
In order to even test it.
we gotta be able to cut lemons

381
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.359
- with them correctly spaced.
- Yeah. we need
to break the bottle.

382
00:17:41.392 --> 00:17:43.095
Tyler:<i>
For any project that
we decide to take on.</i>

383

<i> whether it's a TV show

384
00:17:45.363 --> 00:17:48.200

we spend the time to make it

385
00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:50.335

before we release it.

386
00:17:50.368 --> 00:17:52.370
Jeff:
I know it's the first show
and I know everybody's

387
00:17:52.403 --> 00:17:55.373
dress rehearsal and stuff.
but at some point in time

388
00:17:55.406 --> 00:17:57.509
we gotta pull it all together
and we're running out of time.

389
00:17:57.542 --> 00:17:59.610
To me it just seemed like
a personnel issue still.

390
00:17:59.644 --> 00:18:01.447
There was--
people just didn't know
what they were doing.

391
00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:11.556
So. we've thus far
have not made it smoothly
through the full show.

392
00:18:11.589 --> 00:18:13.425
but we'll-- it's--
you know. game time.

They're so crazy and so funny.

403
00:18:48.693 --> 00:18:50.428
They're probably
the awesomest YouTuber ever.

404
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:52.164
I like all the trick shots
that they do.

405

00:23:48.493 --> 00:23:49.828
I think I missed
by a half an inch.

491
00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:51.563
- Yeah. you did. dude.
- Every single one.

492
00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:54.999
- That was insane.
- That crowd was lit.

493
00:23:55.032 --> 00:23:56.935
- I think my voice is bleeding.
- Oh. yeah. me. too.

494
00:23:56.968 --> 00:23:59.237
- Mykael. you did awesome.
- Great job. guys.

495
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.073
- Here we go.
One. two. three.
- All: 21!

496
00:24:02.106 --> 00:24:04.108
Clearly. it's
a conditioning issue

497
00:24:04.141 --> 00:24:06.711
because I don't feel
like I ran that far.

498
00:24:06.744 --> 00:24:09.647
but I am sucking wind
right now.

499
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.784
Partly adrenaline.
That was incredibly exciting.

500
00:24:14.685 --> 00:24:16.221
- Yo. yo. yo!
- What's up. guys?

501
00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:18.555
- ( kids screaming )
- Ty. Ty. Ty. Ty!

502
00:24:18.589 --> 00:24:20.591
Guys. I tried to
pull it out for you.

503
00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:22.160
I don't know what happened.
I fell apart.

504
00:24:22.193 --> 00:24:24.095
- What up. guys?
- Let's give it up for Coby!

505
00:24:24.128 --> 00:24:26.764
- Yes!
- Come on. come on.

506
00:24:26.797 --> 00:24:30.168
- The champ is here!
- Are we a football team here?
Are we just buds?

507
00:24:30.201 --> 00:24:33.104
- Yeah. some of it.
- Lots of teammates.
lots of siblings.

508
00:24:33.137 --> 00:24:35.005
- Yeah.
- We got older brothers.
younger brothers.

509
00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:36.808
- Nice. nice.
- This is the crew.

510
00:24:36.841 --> 00:24:39.511
I like it. I like it.
Well. what did you guys think?

511
00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:41.246
First show ever.
Not horrible?

512
00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:43.781
- You'd never know!
- Yeah? What was your
favorite...

513
00:24:43.814 --> 00:24:45.950
Drew:<i> The show was phenomenal.
Especially the first one.</i>

514
00:24:45.983 --> 00:24:47.784
<i> just the amount of preparation
that goes into it</i>

515
00:24:47.818 --> 00:24:49.888
and having it go
as seamless as it did.

516
00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:52.156
I thought it was great.
Obviously the crowd loved it.

517
00:24:52.189 --> 00:24:54.225
Fans were into it. The kids.

518
00:24:54.258 --> 00:24:55.793
<i> I mean. it's really
all about the kids</i>

519
00:24:55.826 --> 00:24:57.529
<i> and their level of enjoyment.</i>

520
00:24:57.562 --> 00:24:59.163
And I know our kids had a ball.

521
00:24:59.196 --> 00:25:00.965
How glad are you
that I didn't bring you up

522
00:25:00.998 --> 00:25:03.968
for Wheel Unfortunate
on mayo and apples?

523
00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:06.137
- I appreciate that very much.
- Okay.

524
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.806
Badminton trick shots.
croquet trick shots.

525
00:25:08.839 --> 00:25:10.642
and Build A Catapult Battle.
'cause I want more--

526
00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:14.611
Take notes.
I need a notebook with
all of those written down.

527
00:25:14.645 --> 00:25:16.047
Let's make sure everybody
gets a picture.

528
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.515
Y'all want to get a picture
with everybody?

529
00:25:20.017 --> 00:25:23.288
Coby:<i> I think the tour
is a really unique chance
just to thank our fans.</i>

530
00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:26.724
Thank you guys for coming.
Really appreciate you guys.

531
00:25:26.757 --> 00:25:29.827
So it's gonna be awesome
to go thank them in person.

532
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.897
- Is that tall man approved?
- Just enough.

533
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.699
Ooh. actually I don't fit.

534
00:25:34.732 --> 00:25:36.801
Have we confirmed that Cody's
the worst snorer?

535
00:25:36.834 --> 00:25:38.202
- Yeah.
- Oh. no doubt.

536
00:25:38.235 --> 00:25:41.706
So. good first show.
Checking social media.

537
00:25:41.739 --> 00:25:44.142
Seems like the people
enjoyed it. which is awesome.

538
00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:47.211
That's a nice little weight
lifted off our chests there.

539
00:25:47.244 --> 00:25:50.014
so getting ready
to enjoy an experience--

540
00:25:50.047 --> 00:25:53.184
our first ever
bus sleep. hopefully.

541
00:25:53.217 --> 00:25:54.852
Hopefully. we can sleep.

542
00:25:54.885 --> 00:25:56.187
I'm a little concerned
that snore master

543
00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.722
up here is above me.

544
00:25:57.755 --> 00:25:59.891
Show number two.
here we come.

545
00:25:59.924 --> 00:26:03.895
- I did have dairy. though.
- Oh. great. Good night.

546
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.145
( shouting )

547
00:26:21.178 --> 00:26:25.183
- I love you. Cody!
- Love you more!

548
00:26:25.216 --> 00:26:27.217
I know everybody says this.
but I really do feel like

549
00:26:27.251 --> 00:26:28.954
we have the best fans
in the world.

550
00:26:38.262 --> 00:26:41.165
Garrett:<i>
We have fans from all ages.
all backgrounds.</i>

551
00:26:41.198 --> 00:26:44.335
and I'm really proud to say
that families can watch
our videos together.

552
00:26:44.368 --> 00:26:47.839
- This is Flynn.
- Oh. wow.

553
00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:50.041
- Hey. what's up?
- I've been watching you
for years.

554
00:26:50.074 --> 00:26:52.910
For years? All right.
Oh. let's all get
a little jumping. Okay!

555
00:26:52.943 --> 00:26:54.946
- I love the excitement.
- Nice.

556
00:26:54.979 --> 00:26:57.248
Cody:<i>
Some of our fan interactions
are just priceless.</i>

557
00:26:57.281 --> 00:26:59.149
I'll have kids come up.
complete strangers.

558
00:26:59.183 --> 00:27:01.419
just give me a full hug
and their mom and dad are like.

559
00:27:01.452 --> 00:27:04.155
"What is happening?"
I'm like. "No. I'm a YouTuber."

560
00:27:04.188 --> 00:27:06.190
Garrett:<i> It's flattering
that people come up</i>

561
00:27:06.223 --> 00:27:08.393
<i> and say they love watching
your videos and your content.</i>

562
00:27:08.426 --> 00:27:10.128
<i> what you pour your heart
and soul into.</i>

563
00:27:10.161 --> 00:27:11.429
But it was definitely
weird at first.

564
00:27:11.462 --> 00:27:14.999
Why didn't I do my hair
like this? Golly!

565
00:27:15.032 --> 00:27:17.769
- Do you think I could do it?
- Um. has to be longer.

566
00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:20.271
- Hey. what about me?
- Um. you don't have any.

567
00:27:20.304 --> 00:27:23.341
- All: Oh!
- This guy's cool.

568
00:27:23.374 --> 00:27:25.376
- Who's your favorite?
- Coby.

569
00:27:25.409 --> 00:27:27.679
- Coby.
- ( overlapping chatter )

570
00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:29.947
Coby:<i> When fans come up
and want a picture.</i>

571
00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.417
<i> you never want to give
that person a bad experience</i>

572
00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.285
<i> because they feel like
they know us.</i>

573
00:27:34.318 --> 00:27:36.954
<i> From their perspective.
they do know us</i>

574
00:27:36.987 --> 00:27:41.092
<i> because they've watched hours
of our crazy antics.</i>

575
00:27:41.125 --> 00:27:43.294
<i> Honestly. there's a lot
of weight to the fact</i>

576
00:27:43.327 --> 00:27:46.064
<i> that these kids
hang on our every word.</i>

577
00:27:46.097 --> 00:27:48.333
and that's
a big responsibility.

578
00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:56.074
Hey. just FYI.
we're in Los Angeles. boys.

579
00:27:56.107 --> 00:27:57.809
- Thank you.
- Aerosmith. KISS.

580
00:27:57.842 --> 00:28:00.344
- Gladys Knight and the Pips.
- That's awesome.

581
00:28:00.377 --> 00:28:01.946
A few names
I've heard of up there.

582
00:28:01.979 --> 00:28:04.348
- Oh. Disturbed! Let's go.
- Doobie Brothers.

583
00:28:04.381 --> 00:28:08.019
Led Zepplin.
Pretty much everybody
that you could think of.

584
00:28:08.052 --> 00:28:10.088
Oh. Dude Perfect.
There we are.

585
00:28:10.121 --> 00:28:12.857
- Look at that.
- Oh. wow! What a great spot.

586
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.193
- L.A.! Yes!
- That's nice.

587
00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:17.729
Hey. knee level. That's nice.
Right at the knees.

588
00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:19.864
- That's pretty sweet.
- That's cool.

589
00:28:19.897 --> 00:28:24.001
- Wow. that's super cool.
- We have made it.

590
00:28:24.034 --> 00:28:29.173
In our green room tonight
in L.A.. Rod Stewart.

591
00:28:29.206 --> 00:28:31.341
Neil Young--
Don't know who that is.

592
00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:33.244
Coby:<i>
Even though we've been doing
this for ten years now.</i>

593
00:28:33.277 --> 00:28:35.346
each of our kind of
personalities within the group

594
00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:36.880
haven't really changed.

595
00:28:36.914 --> 00:28:38.449
Look at our living room area.

596
00:28:38.482 --> 00:28:43.221
Cody Jones.
he is smelly. loud.

597
00:28:43.254 --> 00:28:44.889
What do you mean?
He's a great-- he's funny.

598
00:28:44.922 --> 00:28:46.457
- I know. He is.
- He's a funny dude.

599
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.026
Frozen yogurt!

600
00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:51.896
Let's go! Check this out.

601
00:28:51.929 --> 00:28:55.767
That's frozen.
Oh. I need a cup.
That was on me.

602
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.534
Cody has always been
the goofball.

603
00:28:57.568 --> 00:28:59.904
Let's do-- ooh! Ha ha!

604
00:28:59.937 --> 00:29:03.140
Hey. good-looking.

605
00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:04.509
Cory:<i>
The first time I met him.</i>

606
00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:06.177
<i> he was telling me
some goofy story</i>

607
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:08.146
about him being
a door-to-door salesman.

608
00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:09.781
and that's what sold me
on his friendship.

609
00:29:09.814 --> 00:29:11.516
I was like. dude.
this guy's hilarious.

610
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:14.218
These are giant darts
for a normal man.
I'm a tall man.

611
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:17.922
- He's non-confrontational.
- No. he's confrontational.

612
00:29:17.955 --> 00:29:19.056
He'll tell you. like.
when he's not--

613
00:29:19.089 --> 00:29:20.191
It's tough to put
this kid in a box.

614
00:29:20.224 --> 00:29:25.362
- I know.
- Yes!

615
00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:27.465
Garrett:<i> Coby?
What would you say about Coby?</i>

616
00:29:27.498 --> 00:29:30.401
I more concerned right now
what everyone's gonna
say about myself.

617
00:29:30.434 --> 00:29:32.036
That's where you mind went?

618
00:29:34.271 --> 00:29:36.974
Let me guess what people
would say about me.

619
00:29:37.007 --> 00:29:39.544
They won't really
say anything about. like.
my personality or anything.

620
00:29:39.577 --> 00:29:42.079
They'll just be like.
"Nah. he's clean."

621
00:29:42.112 --> 00:29:44.448
Garrett is the cleanest
person I have ever met.

622
00:29:44.481 --> 00:29:46.551
Yep. He likes to sweep. vacuum.

623
00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:49.086
I don't even know what that is.
but he does it.

624
00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:51.555
Guess I'll clean up
as you guys are--

625
00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:53.558
- Thanks. Gare.
- Go ahead. All right. Gare.

626
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.962
Yeah. it's a concrete cleaner.

627
00:29:57.995 --> 00:30:01.098
Instead of just
moving dirt around.
it'll actually pick it up.

628
00:30:01.131 --> 00:30:02.567
I' m excited.

629
00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.334
Cory:<i> Garrett is
an absolute neat freak.</i>

630
00:30:04.368 --> 00:30:07.004
and just by far
the most responsible.

631
00:30:07.037 --> 00:30:08.606
I'm hoping one day
they'll grow up.
be 30-year-olds.

632
00:30:08.639 --> 00:30:10.608
but not quite yet.

633
00:30:10.641 --> 00:30:13.544
Tyler:<i>
If we didn't have a guy
like Garrett in the group</i>

634
00:30:13.577 --> 00:30:15.279
<i> that cared about cleanliness</i>

635
00:30:15.312 --> 00:30:17.581
<i> and being organized
and stuff like that.</i>

636
00:30:17.615 --> 00:30:19.116
what would this place
look like?

637
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:20.584
We wouldn't have room
to do this interview

638
00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:23.154
because there would be
a pile of garbage right here.

639
00:30:25.155 --> 00:30:27.591
- Yeah!
- Let's go! Let's go!

640
00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:30.127
- Let's go!
- Cody:<i> Cory. huh?</i>

641
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.462
- Whoo!
- I'm going to be the first

642
00:30:31.495 --> 00:30:33.129
to say that is
one handsome man.

643
00:30:33.163 --> 00:30:35.499
- Oh. Wow. yes.
- Strong last name.

644
00:30:35.532 --> 00:30:38.101
- Just a lot to like.
you know?
- Oh. my.

645
00:30:38.135 --> 00:30:39.570
- Yeah. you would.
- Yeah.

646
00:30:39.603 --> 00:30:42.306
- He's Twin Two.
- He's a twin. They love that.

647
00:30:42.339 --> 00:30:44.408
They do like that.

648
00:30:44.441 --> 00:30:46.978
<i> You can't really separate
the twins.</i>

649
00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:50.615
<i> I mean. I have never met twins
that love being twins</i>

650
00:30:50.648 --> 00:30:52.449
<i> as much as our twins.</i>

651
00:30:52.483 --> 00:30:54.418
It's true. It's true.

652
00:30:54.451 --> 00:30:56.954
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

653
00:30:56.987 --> 00:30:59.056
Man:
It's amazing. Coby is back!

654
00:30:59.089 --> 00:31:01.893
Cory:<i>
Coby has been the encourager.</i>

655
00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:05.362
<i> And Coby is. like. the
unshakeable positive attitude</i>

656
00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:07.398
that most people really
appreciate in their friendships.

657
00:31:07.431 --> 00:31:11.135
Whoo! You can't touch me.

658
00:31:11.168 --> 00:31:13.036
Coby:<i>
Cory's super loyal.</i>

659
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.371
<i> He will stick with you
to the end.</i>

660
00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:16.507
He will be the first one
to have your back.

661
00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.341
<i> I've always appreciated that
about him.</i>

662
00:31:18.375 --> 00:31:20.912
Coby and Cory signing off.

663
00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:23.380
Do you want to say
some nice things about me?

664
00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:25.650
Uh. yeah. Ty. Tyler.

665
00:31:25.683 --> 00:31:28.019
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

666
00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.654
- Ty.
- Ty.

667
00:31:29.687 --> 00:31:32.924
- What a guy. huh?
- ( mumbling )

668
00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:35.693
When he gets an audience.
the guy just comes alive.

669
00:31:35.726 --> 00:31:39.030
Aah! This is
the greatest toy ever!

670
00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:40.231
Cody:<i> I think he's the face
of the group.</i>

671
00:31:40.264 --> 00:31:41.564
What's up. guys?
We're Dude Perfect.

672
00:31:41.598 --> 00:31:43.000
We're Dude Perfect.
We're Dude Perfect.

673
00:31:43.033 --> 00:31:44.334
( as Yoda )
No. no. no. not today.

674
00:31:44.368 --> 00:31:46.504
- Perfect!
- ( inhales deeply )

675
00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:49.040
Cory:<i> Tyler's always been
the center of attention.</i>

676
00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:52.944
- He just turns it on.
- Sometimes you just need
a little disguise.

677
00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:54.979
Dude. let me-- let me just
tweak your nose right here.

678
00:31:55.012 --> 00:31:57.380
He's talented at a lot
of random stuff.

679
00:31:57.414 --> 00:31:59.383
- like. uh...
- Throwing plungers.

680
00:31:59.416 --> 00:32:01.418
Throwing plungers.
Unbelievable.

681
00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:03.688
Cody:<i> He threw a plunger.
It stuck on the wall.</i>

682
00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:05.389
<i> And the excitement
that came from that.</i>

683
00:32:05.422 --> 00:32:07.191
<i> you're like. okay.
we gotta do a video</i>

684
00:32:07.224 --> 00:32:09.260
<i> because he is jazzed
out of his mind.</i>

685
00:32:09.293 --> 00:32:11.428
Really was hoping you were
going to high-five me there.

686
00:32:11.462 --> 00:32:15.199
You're a master of none.
but kind of like
above average though.

687
00:32:15.232 --> 00:32:16.701
But he's not
a master of anything.

688
00:32:16.734 --> 00:32:19.704
You mean I'm good at everything.
but not great at anything.

689
00:32:19.737 --> 00:32:21.339
That is what I'm going for.

690
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.443
He's in the ring!
He's going!

691
00:32:29.079 --> 00:32:31.448
( playing "Mary Had
A Little Lamb" )

692
00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.191
The cool thing about this item
is when I breathe this in...

693
00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:46.097
- That seems unsafe.
- ( deep voice )
I can talk like this!

694
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.266
Yeah! What do you think?
Is that a cool item?

695
00:32:49.299 --> 00:32:52.303
( cheering )

696
00:32:55.672 --> 00:32:58.442
Cobes. you owe me 100
if this goes in.

697
00:32:58.475 --> 00:33:00.311
- Coby: 50.
- All right.

698
00:33:00.344 --> 00:33:02.446
One of our big fears
at the beginning

699
00:33:02.479 --> 00:33:04.648
was that our fans
would just want to see. like.
a trick shot tour.

700
00:33:04.681 --> 00:33:07.318
This is the Cowboy stadium shot.

701
00:33:13.323 --> 00:33:17.695
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

702
00:33:17.728 --> 00:33:20.798
A live trick shot show
just wouldn't be that fun.

703
00:33:20.831 --> 00:33:22.565
Thanks for the 50. Cobes.

704
00:33:22.599 --> 00:33:25.336
I mean. it would if you made it
on the first try. but...

705
00:33:25.369 --> 00:33:29.305
That was pretty close.
Ah. dang it.

706
00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:31.609
Oh!

707
00:33:31.642 --> 00:33:33.177
We actually don't make it
on the first try.

708
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.480
Oh!

709
00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:40.018
( glass shatters )

710
00:33:41.351 --> 00:33:42.820
Stop. stop. stop. stop!

711
00:33:42.853 --> 00:33:44.789
( glass shatters )

712
00:33:44.822 --> 00:33:47.224
Why were you not
holding it?

713
00:33:47.257 --> 00:33:49.226
We have. We have made it
on the first try.

714
00:33:49.259 --> 00:33:52.163
This is the world's longest
blindfolded basketball shot.

715
00:33:56.366 --> 00:33:58.169
- Oh. you literally made it!
- No.

716
00:33:58.202 --> 00:33:59.837
You swished it! I swear!

717
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.206
- That was the first take.
- No way!

718
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.810
<i> We're actually pretty good.
but it's not gonna happen
on the first try every time.</i>

719
00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:08.212
- Oh!
- Ooh. cheese balls.
Love those.

720
00:34:09.379 --> 00:34:11.514
- Oh. boy.
- ( laughter )

721
00:34:11.547 --> 00:34:13.250
- Spoon please.
- Coby:<i> So we knew we didn't</i>

722
00:34:13.283 --> 00:34:15.485
<i> want to only do
trick shot videos.</i>

723
00:34:15.518 --> 00:34:17.687
Could we try
something different?
Would our fans still like it?

724
00:34:17.721 --> 00:34:22.359
Whoo! Timster.
did you see me get pitted
on that gnarly barrel?

725
00:34:22.391 --> 00:34:24.328
Both: Whoo!

726
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.696
So we took a huge risk
and came up

727
00:34:25.728 --> 00:34:27.764
with this whole
kind of comedy series

728
00:34:27.797 --> 00:34:30.467
-<i> called "Stereotypes." </i>
- Time to take a picture.

729
00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:33.270
Whoa! Oh. yeah!

730
00:34:33.303 --> 00:34:35.505
Whoo! Nice toss!

731
00:34:35.539 --> 00:34:38.809
"Stereotypes"
is basically us poking fun

732
00:34:38.842 --> 00:34:40.544
<i> at all of the different types</i>

733
00:34:40.577 --> 00:34:42.313
<i> of people you would see
in one given situation.</i>

734
00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:45.550
( screaming )

735
00:34:49.553 --> 00:34:52.223
Tyler:<i>
There are millions of videos
to watch online.</i>

736
00:34:52.255 --> 00:34:54.692
<i> so it's always a risk when
you decide to do something new.</i>

737
00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:58.261
- What do you guys want to do?
- I don't know.
We could go hiking.

738
00:35:02.699 --> 00:35:03.868
What are you gonna do
at the end?

739
00:35:03.901 --> 00:35:06.904
Just turn around
and walk back?

740
00:35:06.937 --> 00:35:08.806
To be honest with you.
I was pretty hesitant about it.

741
00:35:08.839 --> 00:35:11.442
<i> I didn't understand
how we were going to go from</i>

742
00:35:11.475 --> 00:35:13.410
<i> all these more
hardcore trick shot.</i>

743
00:35:13.443 --> 00:35:15.346
<i> like. heavy celebration videos
to us now playing these.</i>

744
00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:16.814
<i> like. goofy characters.</i>

745
00:35:16.847 --> 00:35:19.817
I didn't even know they had
samples here at this store.

746
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.319
<i> All five of us were very
surprised at the reaction.</i>

747
00:35:22.352 --> 00:35:24.221
What would you say
would be the best one?

748
00:35:24.254 --> 00:35:26.156
What's the name of this stuff?
Never mind. We're good. Thanks.

749
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.691
People absolutely loved it.

750
00:35:27.724 --> 00:35:31.262
Whoo! Ha-ha! Ski tips up.

751
00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:34.365
- It's time to--
-<i> And it's quickly become one</i>

752
00:35:34.398 --> 00:35:36.167
of the most popular things
we've ever done.

753
00:35:39.336 --> 00:35:42.906
There is one stereotype
that fans seem to love
and can't get enough of.

754
00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.544
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh. I see where this is going.

755
00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:50.181
Sure. let's-- let's talk
about my rage issues.

756
00:35:50.214 --> 00:35:51.916
( cheering )

757
00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:54.418
And that is the Rage Monster.

758
00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:56.587
I just feel like
I'm a changed man. honestly.

759
00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.455
Like. I don't think that's
something that we have to
worry about in the future.

760
00:35:58.488 --> 00:36:00.524
See. and I thought
the same thing.

761
00:36:00.557 --> 00:36:03.459
but I just--
my thing is I think
you love breaking stuff.

762
00:36:03.493 --> 00:36:04.929
Like. you enjoy
the thrill of the break.

763
00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:06.463
- Really?
- Yeah.

764
00:36:06.496 --> 00:36:08.899
You could get everybody
in here chanting

765
00:36:08.932 --> 00:36:11.569
"Rage on stage!".
and I'm just not gonna do it.

766
00:36:11.602 --> 00:36:13.870
- I'm a changed--
- Rage on stage! Rage on stage!

767
00:36:13.904 --> 00:36:16.807
- And I am proud
of you for-- hey!
- ( chanting continues )

768
00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.277
No! No. no. no.
Ty. ear muffs. Ear muffs. Ty.

769
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.714
Ty. stop. Hey. stop!
You don't understand. No!

770
00:36:23.747 --> 00:36:24.949
Tyler:<i> We knew that
we had to figure out a way</i>

771
00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:26.450
to put the Rage Monster
in the live tour

772
00:36:26.483 --> 00:36:28.352
just because
it's everybody's favorite.

773
00:36:28.385 --> 00:36:31.755
<i> but it's also one of the most
fun things to do for me.</i>

774
00:36:31.788 --> 00:36:34.458
Hey. stop!
We've gone the whole tour
without an incident. Stop!

775
00:36:34.491 --> 00:36:36.393
Because I just get
to destroy stuff.

776
00:36:36.426 --> 00:36:40.598
- No. shut it down!
- ( screaming )

777
00:36:41.865 --> 00:36:44.868
( screaming )

778
00:36:47.537 --> 00:36:50.707
Cory:<i>
The Rage Monster has been seen
almost a billion times.</i>

779
00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:53.009
That is a scary thought.
I'm so sorry. moms.

780
00:36:53.043 --> 00:36:54.845
( screaming )

781
00:36:54.878 --> 00:36:57.248
Tell your wife I'm sorry.
Just kidding. I'm not!

782
00:36:57.281 --> 00:37:00.817
( screaming )
Get out of the way!

783
00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:02.953
It's nice. It's nice.
It feels good.

784
00:37:02.986 --> 00:37:06.257
<i> It feels good
to release some of that
every once in awhile.</i>

785
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.392
And not that there's
anything that really needs
to be released...

786
00:37:08.425 --> 00:37:09.860
( screaming )

787
00:37:09.893 --> 00:37:11.962
But if there was.
it would feel good.

788
00:37:11.995 --> 00:37:15.566
( screaming )

789
00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:18.002
Cory:<i> It's his favorite
part of Dude Perfect.
there's no question.</i>

790
00:37:18.035 --> 00:37:21.471
It's his absolute favorite thing
to do is to just go crazy.

791
00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:23.708
( indistinct shouting )

792
00:37:25.976 --> 00:37:27.979
No. not the gumballs!

793
00:37:31.915 --> 00:37:33.884
<i> We get so many emails
from parents like.</i>

794
00:37:33.917 --> 00:37:35.319
"Please get rid
of the Rage Monster."

795
00:37:35.352 --> 00:37:39.290
How about a paint job?
( screaming )

796
00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:42.393
He's not going anywhere.
It's not gonna happen.

797
00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:43.827
I'm sorry. It's too great.

798
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.462
No! Not the stage power box!

799
00:37:45.495 --> 00:37:47.298
( screaming )

800
00:37:52.869 --> 00:37:56.307
( cheering )

801
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.743
I'm backstage. man!
He got me good.

802
00:37:59.776 --> 00:38:01.745
Can everyone turn
their lights on?

803
00:38:01.778 --> 00:38:04.682
I was making progress
and then you guys
started chanting stuff

804
00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.750
and ruined
the whole dadgum thing!

805
00:38:06.783 --> 00:38:10.654
I hope each and every one of you
feels a little bit responsible.

806
00:38:10.687 --> 00:38:13.857
I just--
he's around here somewhere.
We gotta find him.

807
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:17.895
- Hey!
- What? What do you want?

808
00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:23.667
- That was unbelievable.
- No!

809
00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:28.404
That was the best rage
I've ever had!

810
00:38:28.438 --> 00:38:29.440
No!

811
00:38:30.807 --> 00:38:33.077
Coby:<i> There's no doubt
looking back</i>

812
00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.814
<i> that "Stereotypes"
was one of the biggest
turning points in DP.</i>

813
00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:39.083
By shifting and expanding
beyond trick shots.

814
00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:42.419
we just allowed ourselves
to reach a whole new
group of people.

815
00:38:42.452 --> 00:38:44.788
<i> That's probably
one of the things</i>

816
00:38:44.821 --> 00:38:46.656
<i> we're most grateful
to our fans for</i>

817
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.627
<i> is that they stuck with us
when we tried new things.</i>

818
00:38:55.065 --> 00:38:58.836
Oh. we got the late crowd
staying up to send us off.

819
00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:01.638
Thank you guys for coming!

820
00:39:01.671 --> 00:39:03.908
- See you guys!
- Thank you guys!

821
00:39:08.145 --> 00:39:10.481
We're here in Fresno.
Panda is ready to rock.

822
00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:12.483
It's gonna get loud. California.
Let's go.

823
00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:14.852
Guys. I don't know
if y'all know this.

824
00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:17.121

825
00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:19.490
- Yeah.
- So we need you
to go easy on us.

826
00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:21.992

than normal.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.516
We'll be on her
for five weeks.

836
00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:47.584
- Here's the dudes.
- Whoa!

837
00:39:47.617 --> 00:39:50.554
- Hey. what's
the temperature in here?
- It's cold. man.

838
00:39:50.587 --> 00:39:51.789
- All righty.
- Let's have some fun.

839
00:39:55.859 --> 00:39:57.161
Being in a brand new city
every morning

840
00:39:57.194 --> 00:39:59.430
when you wake up
is very tiring.

841
00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:01.865
It's very early.
3 AM in the morning. actually.

842
00:40:01.898 --> 00:40:04.701
-<i> But incredible awesome. </i>
- Yeah!

843
00:40:04.734 --> 00:40:06.036
Once in a lifetime opportunity.

844
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:07.671
Picklesburgh.
we're here for you.

845
00:40:07.704 --> 00:40:09.940
This is the Taj Mahal
of Pickle Row.

846
00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:12.410
Bleah!

847
00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:18.882
- Ahh!
- No!

848
00:40:18.915 --> 00:40:20.717
Coby:<i>
Probably my favorite part
is you strip away</i>

849
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.486
<i> all the business part
of what we do</i>

850
00:40:22.519 --> 00:40:23.854
<i> and we're just back
to being roommates again.</i>

851
00:40:23.887 --> 00:40:24.888
which is super fun.

852
00:40:24.921 --> 00:40:26.557
When we get off the bus before

853
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.858
we go inside for the show.

854
00:40:27.891 --> 00:40:29.460
<i> we've got a few hours
to kill.</i>

855
00:40:29.493 --> 00:40:31.628
( overlapping chatter )

856
00:40:31.661 --> 00:40:34.198
Let's go!
Get on the ground!

857
00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:36.900
Yes! My back is burning

858
00:40:36.933 --> 00:40:39.537
from carrying this team.
Let's go!

859
00:40:41.571 --> 00:40:43.140
Heavenly Father.
thank you for tonight.

860
00:40:43.173 --> 00:40:44.741
Thank you for the opportunity
for us to be here on tour

861
00:40:44.774 --> 00:40:46.042
in front of all of these people.

862
00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.578
I just pray
that you give us guidance.

863
00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:49.613
wisdom.
just a good show and energy.

864
00:40:49.646 --> 00:40:51.615
- In Jesus' name.
- Thanks. guys. Let's do it.

865
00:40:51.648 --> 00:40:54.585
- Stay strong.
- Let's do it.
Let's do it. buddy.

866
00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:57.020
Unh! There's nobody.
but that's cool.

867
00:40:57.053 --> 00:40:58.788
- Yeah. that's fine.
- I'm gonna go out

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:23.981
I've never been so proud!

879
00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:28.685
Thank you. guys!
This goes out to you!

880
00:41:28.718 --> 00:41:30.988
Hey. Ty. by the way. welcome to
the winner's circle. man.

881
00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:33.958
- It's a good place to be!
- Whoo!

882
00:41:36.826 --> 00:41:39.630
One thing I don't think
we've talked much about
over the years

883
00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.865
is how close we were
to quitting Dude Perfect.

884
00:41:41.898 --> 00:41:45.602
<i> After college. we basically
went our separate ways.</i>

885
00:41:45.635 --> 00:41:47.838
We were all living
in different cities.

886
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:49.907
<i> A couple of the guys
got married.</i>

887
00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.776
<i> We all started new jobs.</i>

888
00:41:52.809 --> 00:41:55.812
We were just in different
stages of life at the time.

889
00:41:55.845 --> 00:41:58.682
<i> But somehow we knew we wanted
to keep Dude Perfect going.</i>

890
00:41:58.715 --> 00:42:01.952
Coby:<i> Monday through Friday.
Cory and I ran Dude Perfect.</i>

891
00:42:01.985 --> 00:42:03.287
<i> And then on the weekends.</i>

892
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.989
we would drive
four hours to Dallas.

893
00:42:06.022 --> 00:42:07.724
<i> and the other guys
would meet us</i>

894
00:42:07.757 --> 00:42:09.626
<i> and we would film
to keep the channel going.</i>

895
00:42:09.659 --> 00:42:11.762
That time of any
was the most stressful.

896
00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:14.298
<i> While they're eating.
breathing. drinking
Dude Perfect.</i>

897
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:17.034
we're trying to balance that
with also real jobs.

898
00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:19.269
<i> also with new families.</i>

899
00:42:19.302 --> 00:42:21.004
And so we did that
for four or five years.

900
00:42:21.037 --> 00:42:22.339
and it was just a grind.

901
00:42:22.372 --> 00:42:23.906
We knew that it was unhealthy.

902
00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.742
the place
that we had gotten to.

903
00:42:25.775 --> 00:42:28.011
Cory:<i> When we were at
our absolute breaking point.</i>

904
00:42:28.044 --> 00:42:30.580
<i> I had edited three
straight nights in a row.</i>

905
00:42:30.614 --> 00:42:31.882
And I woke up in the morning

906
00:42:31.915 --> 00:42:34.017
and went to the sink
to brush my teeth.

907
00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:36.019
and I just noticed
all the water

908
00:42:36.052 --> 00:42:37.688
was just dripping
down my face.

909
00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:40.023
And I moved my mouth
and I realized. like.

910
00:42:40.056 --> 00:42:42.726
one side of my face
was totally paralyzed.

911
00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:46.196
Bet you can't do this.

912
00:42:46.229 --> 00:42:51.134
<i> I had Bell's Palsy.
which is a temporary
facial paralysis.</i>

913
00:42:51.167 --> 00:42:56.106
What most people attribute it to
is stress and lack of sleep.

914
00:42:56.139 --> 00:42:58.709
Coby:<i> We were exhausted.
they were exhausted.</i>

915
00:42:58.742 --> 00:43:00.377
<i> their wives were exhausted.</i>

916
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:03.046
We were about to just
pack it up and be done.

917
00:43:03.079 --> 00:43:04.881
Coby:<i>
A lot of texts would be like.</i>

918
00:43:04.914 --> 00:43:06.316
<i> "Are we doing this
or are we quitting?"</i>

919
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:07.718
Because something's
gotta change

920
00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:09.353
because we can't
keep doing this.

921
00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:12.723
You gotta remember.
back then. being a YouTuber.

922
00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:14.825
making a career out of it
was unheard of.

923
00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:17.661
Coby:<i>
With a million subscribers.
which you would think</i>

924
00:43:17.694 --> 00:43:20.096
-<i> is a pretty
successful channel. </i>
- Boom!

925
00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.898
But I guess with five guys.
hard to make enough money

926
00:43:21.931 --> 00:43:23.667
doing that.
even at that point.

927
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.801
We definitely hit
a breaking point.

928
00:43:25.835 --> 00:43:27.638
We were going to film
the Goodyear Blimp shot.

929
00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:29.873
We are gonna do a shot
out of the Goodyear Blimp.

930
00:43:29.906 --> 00:43:31.375
Garrett:<i> Ty gets a call</i>

931
00:43:31.408 --> 00:43:33.243
<i> and just gets chewed out
by his boss.</i>

932
00:43:33.276 --> 00:43:34.911
He's like.
"Well. that's my boss.

933
00:43:34.944 --> 00:43:36.779
He told me that I can't miss
any more Saturdays."

934
00:43:38.915 --> 00:43:41.218
"If we wanna keep doing
Dude Perfect. I'm gonna
have to quit my job."

935
00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:44.921
And somebody else chimed in.
"Maybe we should talk about

936
00:43:44.954 --> 00:43:47.257
whether we should all quit
our jobs and go all in on this.

937
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:50.394
because otherwise
I think we're gonna have to
quit Dude Perfect."

938
00:43:50.427 --> 00:43:52.095
Tyler:<i> We came together
and we're like.</i>

939
00:43:52.128 --> 00:43:54.164
<i> "Hey. if we don't
give this a shot now.</i>

940
00:43:54.197 --> 00:43:57.000
then there's no chance
we'll ever do it in the future."

941
00:43:57.033 --> 00:43:58.969
We basically looked
at the bank statement.

942
00:43:59.002 --> 00:44:00.937
We kind of crunched
some numbers and said.

943
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:04.040
"I think we can pay for food
for the next year."

944
00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:06.109
And so we just
kind of sat there

945
00:44:06.142 --> 00:44:08.310
and thought about it
for a second.

946
00:44:08.344 --> 00:44:10.714
We looked at each other
and we were like...

947
00:44:12.315 --> 00:44:13.684
"Let's just do this."

948
00:44:16.753 --> 00:44:18.422
- Oh!
- Yeah!

949
00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:20.057
Tyler:<i> Everybody was like.
"Well. are you gonna quit?"</i>

950
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.425
"Yeah. I'll quit."
"Well. are you gonna quit?"

951
00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:23.060
"Yeah. no. definitely."
And then it's like.

952
00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:24.961
nobody was really making
any moves.

953
00:44:24.994 --> 00:44:26.797
It was like. how sure are we

954
00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.799
that everybody's gonna quit
when I leave this job?

955
00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:31.134
And I remember texting
all of the wives.
and I was like.

956
00:44:31.167 --> 00:44:33.837
<i> "Your husband's
quitting their jobs. right?
'Cause mine just quit ours."</i>

957
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.305
Imagine telling your
father-in-law

958
00:44:35.338 --> 00:44:40.010
you're gonna do
YouTube as a job.

959
00:44:40.043 --> 00:44:42.746
with a wife
that's his daughter.

960
00:44:42.779 --> 00:44:44.414
I don't know why he said yes.

961
00:44:44.447 --> 00:44:46.383
He didn't.
'Cause I didn't ask.

962
00:44:46.416 --> 00:44:48.919
So that's how you get
the answer you want.

963
00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:51.922
Tyler:<i> It was probably
extremely ill-advised</i>

964
00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:53.990
<i> to leave all these paying jobs</i>

965
00:44:54.023 --> 00:44:56.393
<i> and start trying to make
a living on YouTube.</i>

966
00:44:56.426 --> 00:44:59.162
- That's crazy.
- Bethany:<i> Like are you sure
we want to do this?</i>

967
00:44:59.195 --> 00:45:02.032
<i> It was kind of we had
to decide as wives together to.</i>

968
00:45:02.065 --> 00:45:03.834
like. say yes to this.

969
00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:05.068
And then I think we all
went back to our husbands

970
00:45:05.101 --> 00:45:07.003
- and said. "Okay."
- Whoo!

971
00:45:07.036 --> 00:45:10.140
But the minute
we all went all in.
the thing just exploded.

The deals just started
flooding in.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.756
Tyler:<i>
Within that first month.</i>

979
00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:27.057
<i> we signed our first
big deal with Nerf.</i>

980
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:28.792
Yeah! Woohoo!

981
00:45:28.825 --> 00:45:31.160
Company after company hired us
to do videos for them.

982
00:45:31.194 --> 00:45:32.863
It was just like. boom. quit.

983
00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:34.531
Boom. this is what you
were called to do. Do it.

984
00:45:34.564 --> 00:45:36.500
<i> ♪ I feel it ♪</i>

985
00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:38.034
Cody:<i> There were all
these opportunities</i>

986
00:45:38.067 --> 00:45:40.237
at our doorstep.
and we took advantage of it.

987
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:42.973
Coby:<i>
Cory wanted to write a book.
He made that happen.</i>

988
00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:44.473
Cody:<i>
We started a merchandise line.</i>

989
00:45:44.507 --> 00:45:46.910
<i> and we did three seasons
of a TV show.</i>

990
00:45:46.943 --> 00:45:48.311
Coby:<i> We were making
Dude Perfect games</i>

991
00:45:48.344 --> 00:45:49.813
<i> that were going to
the top of the charts.</i>

992
00:45:49.846 --> 00:45:51.481
We were busy fast.

993
00:45:51.514 --> 00:45:53.884
Cory:<i>
Suddenly we are flying
all over the world.</i>

994
00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:57.287
I love the travel side
of Dude Perfect that's allowed
us to go to New Zealand.

995
00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.890
to Australia. to-- actually.
we've never been to Australia.

996
00:45:59.923 --> 00:46:01.057
I don't know why I said that.
That was weird.

997
00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.226
- Someday.
- Okay. here we go.

998
00:46:03.259 --> 00:46:05.996
Every major event that
every kid dreams of going to.

999
00:46:06.029 --> 00:46:08.365
Super Bowl. World Cup. Olympics.

1000
00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:10.333
<i> National Championships.
we went to 'em.</i>

1001
00:46:10.366 --> 00:46:13.036
We were literally
checking off a dream list.

1002
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:15.238
Garrett:<i>
Celebrities are calling us.</i>

1003
00:46:15.271 --> 00:46:16.907
Coby:<i> These athletes wanted
to be part of the videos.</i>

1004
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.975
people that we've looked up to
our entire lives.

1005
00:46:19.008 --> 00:46:21.044
It still seems crazy to us.

1006
00:46:21.077 --> 00:46:23.079
And so at some point.
we were like. "Listen.

1007
00:46:23.112 --> 00:46:25.148
we need a place
we can call home base."

1008
00:46:25.181 --> 00:46:27.184
Welcome to the brand new
Dude Perfect headquarters.

1009
00:46:27.217 --> 00:46:29.252
otherwise known as DPHQ.

1010
00:46:29.285 --> 00:46:31.154
Garrett:<i> We moved into
our first office.</i>

1011
00:46:31.187 --> 00:46:33.557
and rapidly outgrew that
in a couple of years.

1012
00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:37.861
Today's a huge day
because we're unveiling our
brand new office. DPHQ2.

1013
00:46:37.894 --> 00:46:40.296
- Let's do it!
- Whoo!

1014
00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.532
This section of the office
I've nicknamed The Fun Zone.

1015
00:46:42.565 --> 00:46:45.235
We've got our
putting and chipping green
right here out front.

1016
00:46:45.268 --> 00:46:47.070
It's a little silly to call
this place an office

1017
00:46:47.103 --> 00:46:48.538
<i> 'cause we have
a golf simulator</i>

1018
00:46:48.571 --> 00:46:50.273
<i> and a hockey rink
and basketball court.</i>

1019
00:46:50.306 --> 00:46:52.943
Over here we've got blitzball.
football. and soccer.

1020
00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.311
It's a pretty sweet place.

1021
00:46:54.344 --> 00:46:56.112
Coby:<i>
Every day I show up at work</i>

1022
00:46:56.145 --> 00:46:57.480
<i> and my four best friends
are there.</i>

1023
00:46:57.513 --> 00:46:59.982
It just doesn't get
any better than that.

1024
00:47:00.016 --> 00:47:02.118
Cory:<i> If the five of us
had not all committed.</i>

1025
00:47:02.151 --> 00:47:04.386
<i> if we'd gotten cold feet
at any point.</i>

1026
00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.423
Like. it wouldn't have happened.
We would have been done.

1027
00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:09.092
Cory:<i> It's so hard to get us
to agree to anything.</i>

1028
00:47:09.125 --> 00:47:10.594
<i> I mean. we are five
very different people.</i>

1029
00:47:10.627 --> 00:47:12.128
<i> so you would think
that one of us</i>

1030
00:47:12.161 --> 00:47:13.430
<i> would have tapped out
at this point.</i>

1031
00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:15.232
but we haven't. and that's key.

1032
00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:17.234
We need all of us.
I mean. we really do.

1033
00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:23.874
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen.
at this time.

1034
00:47:23.907 --> 00:47:25.508
please direct your attention

1035
00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:27.611
to the Wrigley Field
pitcher's mound.

1036
00:47:27.644 --> 00:47:32.149
From Frisco. Texas.
please welcome Dude Perfect.

1037
00:47:36.085 --> 00:47:39.089
This job has basically allowed
us to just continually

1038
00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:40.624
check boxes
off of a bucket list

1039
00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:42.959
that we honestly never even
really knew that we had.

1040
00:47:42.992 --> 00:47:44.628
Okay. here we go. boys.

1041
00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:47.464
Spread out.
Cory. left side.

1042
00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:48.999
- That's good.
- Oh. it's nice.

1043
00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:51.001
- A little high.
- That's nice.

1044
00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:53.003
Awesome.
We'll see you guys
tonight. okay?

1045
00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:55.338
- Will you all
cheer loud tonight?
- You betcha.

1046
00:47:55.371 --> 00:47:58.675
We're doing our live tour.
So we're going to different
arenas and doing. like.

1047
00:47:58.708 --> 00:48:01.578
battles and trick shots
and stuff for everybody.
So it's been fun.

1048
00:48:01.611 --> 00:48:04.346
I was telling Jim.
some say we have
the best job playing ball.

1049
00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:07.183
- but I'm pretty sure
you guys have it nicer.
- It's not bad. yeah.

1050
00:48:07.216 --> 00:48:08.551
- We don't disagree.
- No.

1051
00:48:12.088 --> 00:48:15.358
Want to visit Wrigley Field?
Through out the first pitch?
Do some batting practice?

1052
00:48:15.391 --> 00:48:20.063
- Sounds good to me.
- Yeah. Kris Bryant
in the house.

1053
00:48:21.397 --> 00:48:23.433
- Oh. there we go.
- Okay. I like it.

1054
00:48:23.466 --> 00:48:26.703
Look at the smooth swing.
Just nice and easy.

1055
00:48:26.736 --> 00:48:30.205
- I think you should crank up
the machine for Tyler.
- Oh. really?

1056
00:48:30.239 --> 00:48:33.043
Coby:<i> We still pinch ourselves
by getting a chance
to hang out with them.</i>

1057
00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:35.211
but we've also learned they're
just incredibly normal people.

1058
00:48:35.244 --> 00:48:37.681
- Three. two. one. go!
- Whoo!

1059
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:43.086
They like to have fun.

1060
00:48:43.119 --> 00:48:44.421
What a trip!

1061
00:48:45.455 --> 00:48:48.223
( cheering )

1062
00:48:48.257 --> 00:48:50.493
He stands a little--
stands a little larger.

1063
00:48:50.526 --> 00:48:52.629
( indistinct chatter )

1064
00:48:52.662 --> 00:48:55.231
- Okay.
- That comes off the bat
a little different.

1065
00:48:55.264 --> 00:48:57.400
Yeah. I don't think
any of ours did that.

1066
00:48:57.433 --> 00:48:59.502
Hundred percent. no question.
one of the coolest things

1067
00:48:59.535 --> 00:49:02.071
about being a part
of Dude Perfect
these last ten years

1068
00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:04.240
has been the people
we've gotten to meet.

1069
00:49:04.273 --> 00:49:06.009
- We're Dude Perfect.
- And I'm Russell Wilson.

1070
00:49:06.042 --> 00:49:07.577
- I'm Raheem Sterling.
- I'm Drew Brees.

1071
00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:10.013
- And I'm Paul Rudd.
-<i> ♪ I got the magic ♪</i>

1072
00:49:10.046 --> 00:49:11.413
Oh. no!

1073
00:49:11.447 --> 00:49:14.084
Jeff:<i> There's something
about the guys.</i>

1074
00:49:14.117 --> 00:49:17.087
There's this contagious fun.

1075
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.723
If you were not
a country music singer.
what would you be doing?

1076
00:49:19.756 --> 00:49:23.460
- Camera guy for Dude Perfect.
- Okay. okay.

1077
00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:27.364
I mean whether it's
Serena Williams meeting them
for the first time...

1078
00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:29.099
- Pop-Tart...
- Mm. okay.

1079
00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:30.333
...or toaster strudel?

1080
00:49:30.366 --> 00:49:32.736
I'm going toaster
strudel all day.

1081
00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:36.272
- Yeah!
- We're toaster strudel people!

1082
00:49:36.305 --> 00:49:38.207
- Toaster strudel!
- Come on!

1083
00:49:38.241 --> 00:49:40.110
<i> You put these guys together</i>

1084
00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:43.113
<i>with people who are competitive
and love to have fun</i>

1085
00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:45.382
<i> and seek excellence
in their craft.</i>

1086
00:49:45.415 --> 00:49:47.117
I think people want
to see that.

1087
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:49.386
I'm excited.
A feeling of competition
in the air.

1088
00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:51.154

1091
00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:01.131
- Whoo!
- Good to see you.

1092
00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:03.500
- ( cheering )
- That's good.

1093
00:50:03.533 --> 00:50:06.469
<i> We've been able
to kind of showcase </i>

1094
00:50:06.502 --> 00:50:09.305
<i> the best side of them.
and there's definitely</i>

1095
00:50:09.338 --> 00:50:11.574
<i> some magic that the guys have</i>

1096
00:50:11.607 --> 00:50:14.344
when it comes to creating
those moments.

1097
00:50:14.377 --> 00:50:17.247
- I hate to see you like this.
- Yeah. I do. too.

1098
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.315
Jeff: Hi. guys.
We gotta catch up

1099
00:50:19.348 --> 00:50:20.784
on a couple of things.
our schedule.

1100
00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:23.620
We've got the request
from Zac Efron.

1101
00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:25.587
Coby:<i> Because we're out
for five. six weeks.</i>

1102
00:50:25.621 --> 00:50:26.823
<i>we've definitely got some stuff
we're gonna have to shoot</i>

1103
00:50:26.856 --> 00:50:28.324
while we're on tour.

1104
00:50:28.357 --> 00:50:30.493
A little background
or insight on Zac.

1105
00:50:30.526 --> 00:50:33.163
Love adrenaline and adventure
type things--

1106
00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:34.764
I doubt Zac wrote this.
actually.

1107
00:50:34.797 --> 00:50:37.400
I can picture Zac
and his computer typing.

1108
00:50:37.433 --> 00:50:39.569
( laughter )

1109
00:50:39.602 --> 00:50:42.172
But he does have great
hand-eye coordination.

1110
00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:44.307
- Oh. that's in there?
- According to his publicist.

1111
00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.377
- That's good.
- He's also getting ready
to shoot a new movie.

1112
00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:50.814
- All Sports Golf Battle Four.
- All Sports Golf with Zac Efron
would be pretty funny.

1113
00:50:50.847 --> 00:50:53.249
- And he has a good personality.
- I agree.

1114
00:50:53.282 --> 00:50:55.518
A lot of times if you're working
with an athlete or celebrity

1115
00:50:55.551 --> 00:50:58.455
or somebody like that.
their time's really.
really tight.

1116
00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:07.363
<i> So if they have an opportunity
for us to do something.</i>

1117
00:51:07.396 --> 00:51:08.832
dude. we have to do that.

1118
00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:12.267
- In three. two.
- What's up. guys?

1119
00:51:12.301 --> 00:51:16.840
Welcome to
the FADPASGBWSGZE.

1120
00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:19.576
- What?
- Fourth Annual Dude Perfect

1121
00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:23.746
All Sports Golf Battle
With Special Guest Zac Efron!

1122
00:51:23.779 --> 00:51:25.582
- Here we go!
- Amazing!

1123
00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:27.216
Oh. God.

1124
00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:30.153
We're gonna do a day
of filming with Zac Efron.

1125
00:51:30.186 --> 00:51:31.588
do an All Sports Golf Battle.

1126
00:51:31.621 --> 00:51:34.390
<i> You actually play golf
without golf equipment.</i>

1127
00:51:34.423 --> 00:51:37.392
- Cody: I'm counting on Zac
to bring the energy today.
- Let's take a day off tour.

1128
00:51:37.426 --> 00:51:39.696
Tour's taken a toll on me.
I need Zac to bring the energy.

1129
00:51:39.729 --> 00:51:41.698
- I agree with that.
- I got it. I got it.

1130
00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:45.235
- Let's go. Happy!
- ( laughter )

1131
00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:47.203
- Okay!
- That's okay!
That's gonna roll.

1132
00:51:47.236 --> 00:51:48.738
- Go!
- I've seen worse.

1133
00:51:48.771 --> 00:51:52.242
Is that backspin?
Dude. it stopped
and came backwards.

1134
00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:54.611
Coby:<i> I think part of what's fun
about having guests is</i>

1135
00:51:54.644 --> 00:51:56.812
<i> we just kind of throw them
into our world.</i>

1136
00:51:56.846 --> 00:51:59.616
and they get to come do
something totally random.

1137
00:51:59.649 --> 00:52:01.683
<i> You're going out
the same way as us.</i>

1138
00:52:01.717 --> 00:52:04.521
Hope it goes well for you.

1139
00:52:04.554 --> 00:52:07.690
- Oh!
- ( laughter )

1140
00:52:07.723 --> 00:52:09.625
No!

1141
00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:11.694
First time playing
All Sports Golf?

1142
00:52:11.727 --> 00:52:14.763
It's my first time playing
all sports anything. man.
It's a dream come true.

1143
00:52:14.797 --> 00:52:17.367
- Yeah.
- That was a bomber.

1144
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.569
- That's solid.
- That was a bomber.

1145
00:52:19.602 --> 00:52:22.605
No offense to Zac.
but if we get beat by an actor.
it's just not a good look.

1146
00:52:22.638 --> 00:52:24.774
- This is our brand.
- He's a pretty athletic
actor. Codes.

1147
00:52:24.807 --> 00:52:27.442
- This is what we do for money.
- Codes. he has level ten
hand-eye coordination.

1148
00:52:27.476 --> 00:52:29.612
I get to that.
but the world doesn't know it.

1149
00:52:29.645 --> 00:52:31.915
We were on the same shot
back there.

1150
00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:33.950
I landed on the green.
You were short and had
to "Happy Gilmore."

1151
00:52:33.983 --> 00:52:36.786
If my "Happy Gilmore"
was on the green.
they would be the same.

1152
00:52:36.819 --> 00:52:39.288
I was trying
to get closer than you
on the same shot.

1153
00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:42.458
Honestly. I'm thinking that
I'm accurate here. but we can go
back and count it up.

1154
00:52:42.491 --> 00:52:44.527
I think emotions
are clouding your judgment.

1155
00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.462
It's funny.
we get so competitive anytime
we film our battles.

1156
00:52:47.496 --> 00:52:49.699
and it doesn't matter if
a celebrity is there or not.

1157
00:52:49.732 --> 00:52:52.634
- Hold on.
- 'Cause that's why I tried
to land short over there.

1158
00:52:52.668 --> 00:52:55.805
- Coby. did you whiff
on this hole?
- This is very standard.

1159
00:52:55.838 --> 00:52:57.774
Ask Chad.
Chad. does this happen a lot?

1160
00:52:57.807 --> 00:53:00.475
We can't have
an All Sports Battle
without a large argument.

1161
00:53:00.509 --> 00:53:02.312
- Yeah.
- So once he hits this.

1162
00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:04.547
then I'm one shot up
'cause I haven't hit this yet.

1163
00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:09.452
- Unh-uh.
- We're literally arguing
about these made-up rules

1164
00:53:09.485 --> 00:53:11.321
for this made-up game
we came up with.

1165
00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:12.922
- No. well--
- 'Cause you're doing
two mallet shots

1166
00:53:12.955 --> 00:53:14.591
and I'm about
to only need one.

1167
00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:16.658
The thing is. a win's a win.
and for some of us.

1168
00:53:16.692 --> 00:53:18.394
they don't come around
that often.

1169
00:53:18.427 --> 00:53:19.696
So. you know. you gotta scrap
and claw when you can.

1170
00:53:19.729 --> 00:53:23.665
- Two putt to win.
- Two putt to win.

1171
00:53:23.699 --> 00:53:25.668
- That's in. Great putt.
- What a putt!

1172
00:53:25.701 --> 00:53:28.238
Wow.

1173
00:53:28.271 --> 00:53:29.539
Tyler:<i>
No matter how competitive
it gets though.</i>

1174
00:53:29.572 --> 00:53:31.407
everybody always
ends up having fun.

1175
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.876
After some time to cool down.

1176
00:53:33.909 --> 00:53:36.279
- Well. Ty. congrats. man.
You earned that.
- Thank you.

1177
00:53:36.312 --> 00:53:37.981
He's all yours!

1178
00:53:38.014 --> 00:53:40.016
- Look at this thing.
- You're the champion.

1179
00:53:40.049 --> 00:53:41.684
This was a bowl cut attempt.
wasn't it?

1180
00:53:41.717 --> 00:53:43.519
- I think.
- This was making fun of me.

1181
00:53:43.552 --> 00:53:45.788
- It is.
- How similar are they?

1182
00:53:45.821 --> 00:53:49.359
It's actually closer
than you would expect. Zac.

1183
00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:51.861
Cory:<i> Did we have the haircut
before "High School Musical"?</i>

1184
00:53:51.894 --> 00:53:54.830
- That's my question.
- Are you saying Zac copied us?

1185
00:53:54.864 --> 00:53:57.333
- I'm not saying
he didn't copy us.
- Is that your theory?

1186
00:53:57.366 --> 00:53:59.269
Think I'm gonna actually
give this to Zac for being here.

1187
00:53:59.302 --> 00:54:01.604
He's such a great guest.
You've earned it. Congrats.

1188
00:54:01.637 --> 00:54:04.707
Aww. thanks. guys.
Hey. pound it.

1189
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:06.475
- Noggin.
- All: See ya!

1190
00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:07.510
Whoo!

1191
00:54:13.749 --> 00:54:16.785
What's up. guys?
Bus life pro tip here from Coby.

1192
00:54:16.819 --> 00:54:19.889
There's all these
drawers down here.

1193
00:54:19.922 --> 00:54:22.725
I have unpacked all of
my luggage into these drawers.

1194
00:54:22.758 --> 00:54:25.395
None of the guys know.
I have to make sure to use them

1195
00:54:25.428 --> 00:54:26.763
when they're not
paying attention.

1196
00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:29.031
It is so much better

1197
00:54:29.065 --> 00:54:31.567
than living out
of a suitcase back there.

1198
00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.069
So just keep this between
you guys and me.

1199
00:54:34.103 --> 00:54:36.739
Literally both sides
right here.

1200
00:54:36.772 --> 00:54:38.942
Love ya.
What's up. Codes?

1201
00:54:40.876 --> 00:54:43.046
Your toiletry bag?
I did not.

1202
00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:44.947
It must be hard living out
of the back of the bus. huh?

1203
00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:47.550
- Hey. what?
- What?

1204
00:54:47.583 --> 00:54:48.785
This is my toiletry bag.

1205
00:54:50.953 --> 00:54:52.889
It's got my initials on it.

1206
00:55:02.631 --> 00:55:06.502
Do we have any "Overtime"
fans in the house?

1207
00:55:06.535 --> 00:55:09.038
- Wow!
- I think we do.

1208
00:55:09.071 --> 00:55:12.909
Coby:<i> After we'd been
making trick shots and then
"Stereotypes" for awhile.</i>

1209
00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.944
we felt like people
were starting to get to know us.

1210
00:55:14.977 --> 00:55:17.814
And so we felt the freedom
to really branch out.

1211
00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:19.515
And that's when
we started "Overtime."

1212
00:55:19.548 --> 00:55:22.084
<i> ♪ Tall guy. beard. twins.
purple hoser ♪</i>

1213
00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:24.620
<i>♪ Dude Perfect's in "Overtime ♪</i>

1214
00:55:24.653 --> 00:55:27.823
- All: Oh!
- Ladies and gentlemen.
welcome to "Overtime."

1215
00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:29.759
The show is decent
and the mics are fake.

1216
00:55:29.792 --> 00:55:32.627
Coby:<i> Basically "Overtime"
is our take on a variety show.</i>

1217
00:55:32.661 --> 00:55:35.131
- Here we go.
- Beep. beep. beep. beep.

1218
00:55:35.164 --> 00:55:37.533
Why does he always think it
needs to be a creative intro?

1219
00:55:37.566 --> 00:55:39.702
We got a great show
for you guys today.

1220
00:55:39.735 --> 00:55:42.004
How long have you
been up there?

1221
00:55:42.037 --> 00:55:46.008
- Oh. wow!
- The world's largest
gummy worm!

1222
00:55:46.041 --> 00:55:47.877
- Oh. my gosh.
- Oh. gosh!

1223
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:49.078
- Let's go.
-<i> It gives us an excuse</i>

1224
00:55:49.111 --> 00:55:51.481
to try all types of things.

1225
00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:53.783
- Let's head to Cool Not Cool.
- Whoo-ee!

1226
00:55:53.816 --> 00:55:57.053
Cool Not Cool is basically like
an overhyped show and tell.

1227
00:55:57.086 --> 00:56:00.990
Oh! That's sick!

1228
00:56:01.023 --> 00:56:03.426
When you do an oil painting
of yourself. that's when you
know you've made it in life.

1229
00:56:03.459 --> 00:56:05.395
- It is.
- Yeah!

1230
00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:07.763
- Lords and ladies...
- Cody:<i> On and off camera.</i>

1231
00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:09.699
that's just us being dumb.
being funny.

1232
00:56:09.732 --> 00:56:12.502
<i> teasing each other. whatever.
That's it.</i>

1233
00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:14.837
<i> The only difference really
is that we're behind a desk.</i>

1234
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:18.508
- I got you your own--
- Dude Perfect action figure.

1235
00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:20.676
They didn't turn out exactly
like I was hoping. but. hey.

1236
00:56:20.709 --> 00:56:22.845
I wish that I looked
that muscular in real life.

1237
00:56:22.878 --> 00:56:25.047
- Easy green.
- I agree!

1238
00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.848
I look like I got
bit by a zombie

1239
00:56:26.882 --> 00:56:29.585
- and I'm 90% turned.
- Yeah.

1240
00:56:29.618 --> 00:56:33.022
Who likes Absurd Recurds?

1241
00:56:33.055 --> 00:56:38.727
Nice! Ty is going to attempt
to break another Absurd Recurd.

1242
00:56:38.761 --> 00:56:43.132
- The most lemons cut
in 30 seconds.
- Wow. that's a lot of lemon.

1243
00:56:43.165 --> 00:56:46.636
We've broken a ton
of impossible records
on "Overtime."

1244
00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:48.805
- Three. four.
- It's just gonna be horrible.

1245
00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:50.807
This is might be the worst
five minutes of your life.

1246
00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.675
Ow! That one was a good one.

1247
00:56:52.708 --> 00:56:54.110
- Four!
- You got this.

1248
00:56:54.143 --> 00:56:57.914
- Ten. nine. eight. seven...
- Go!

1249
00:56:57.947 --> 00:57:00.850
- You got it going. son!
- ...five. four...

1250
00:57:00.883 --> 00:57:03.051
- Cheer him on! Here we go!
- ...three. two. one!

1251
00:57:03.085 --> 00:57:06.088
- He's good! He's got it!
- Whoo!

1252
00:57:06.121 --> 00:57:09.559
- Yeah!
- Thank you! I can't see.

1253
00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:11.828
I got lemon juice in my eye.

1254
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:14.464
Garrett:<i>
Then there's Wheel Unfortunate.</i>

1255
00:57:14.497 --> 00:57:15.565
I mean. the name kind of
speaks for itself.

1256
00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:18.100
- ( gasping )
- Oh. yeah.

1257
00:57:18.133 --> 00:57:19.968
- Oh. he's going--
- Dude!

1258
00:57:20.002 --> 00:57:21.571
- He's biting the--
- Oh!

1259
00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:23.573
- ( laughter )
- ( buzzer )

1260
00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:26.609
- ( screaming )
- ( laughing )

1261
00:57:29.678 --> 00:57:31.047
I just-- I have had
a bad streak.

1262
00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:34.616
Now that's what
we're looking for.

1263
00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:35.885
Oh. my gosh.
Oh. my gosh. oh. my gosh.

1264
00:57:35.918 --> 00:57:37.787
All: That's unfortunate.

1265
00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.224
Wheel Unfortunate is also
the only thing we do

1266
00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:42.492
that involves a guest host.

1267
00:57:44.793 --> 00:57:47.564
Talk about an egomaniac.
Oh. man.

1268
00:57:51.033 --> 00:57:54.604
- I'm talking about the one...
- The only.

1269
00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:56.873
Coby:<i> I don't even want
to say his name out loud.</i>

1270
00:57:56.906 --> 00:57:59.108
Don't even want to give
the guy any more air time.

1271
00:58:01.143 --> 00:58:03.980
<i> ( music playing )</i>

1272
00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:11.488
Do we have any Ned Forrester
fans in the house tonight?

1273
00:58:12.955 --> 00:58:14.624
Uh. what Dude Perfect tour?

1274
00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:16.025
Are you talking about
the Ned Forrester Tour

1275
00:58:16.058 --> 00:58:17.560
Featuring Dude Perfect?

1276
00:58:17.593 --> 00:58:18.895
<i> The guys brought me
on the show.</i>

1277
00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:20.663
<i> I'll be honest with you.</i>

1278
00:58:20.696 --> 00:58:22.098
<i> They were kind of struggling
to sell tickets.</i>

1279
00:58:22.131 --> 00:58:24.634
<i> And I came on
and those ticket sales</i>

1280
00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:27.569
<i> just skyrocketed for old Ned!
Thank you!</i>

1281
00:58:27.603 --> 00:58:29.138
Because of you guys!

1282
00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:32.040
Are those the trick shot fellas?
Are they still doing that?

1283
00:58:32.074 --> 00:58:34.977
They still chucking the balls
off high places?

1284
00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:36.245
Oh. let me guess.
It goes in?

1285
00:58:36.278 --> 00:58:38.247
Swish. Oh. wow!
We're so shocked!

1286
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.851
Three. two. oh!

1287
00:58:41.884 --> 00:58:46.255
- Oh. ho. ho. ho!
That was fantastic.
- That is everywhere.

1288
00:58:46.288 --> 00:58:48.157
When they guys first asked me
to come on their little--

1289
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:50.092
What camera
am I looking at here. guys?

1290
00:58:50.125 --> 00:58:52.161
I'm looking over here? Okay.

1291
00:58:52.194 --> 00:58:54.297
You know. the guys asked me
to come along on the road.

1292
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:56.265
bring a little of my show
to their show.

1293
00:58:56.298 --> 00:58:59.267
To be honest. I'm not sure
how we got this one past legal.

1294
00:58:59.301 --> 00:59:01.737
That says
"Eat a live goldfish."

1295
00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:05.308
There's Petey and Peter
swimming around in their bowls.

1296
00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:07.676
Pretty soon they can be
swimming in your bellies.

1297
00:59:10.012 --> 00:59:12.682
Spin that wheel!

1298
00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:14.283
<i> I thought. you know.
sure. I'll help 'em out.</i>

1299
00:59:14.316 --> 00:59:16.285
<i> give them a little pep
in their step for the show.</i>

1300
00:59:16.318 --> 00:59:17.887
Give the people
what they really want.

1301
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.590
I just wanted to see
who wants a Golden Boy?

1302
00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:22.825
<i> ( music playing )</i>

1303
00:59:22.858 --> 00:59:27.196
Old Ned throws it
where the volume goes it.

1304
00:59:29.732 --> 00:59:33.336
I need to hear it!
Who wants it?

1305
00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:35.605
You guys don't think
I can get it there?

1306
00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:38.874
Coming in hot!

1307
00:59:38.907 --> 00:59:41.310
<i> I've actually got another
interview to head to.</i>

1308
00:59:41.343 --> 00:59:42.345
so I'm gonna head out
and do that.

1309
00:59:42.378 --> 00:59:44.113
Thank you guys for your time.

1310
00:59:44.146 --> 00:59:46.048
If you guys want.
you can thank me.

1311
00:59:46.081 --> 00:59:50.086
Okay. thank you guys.
See ya. Ned out!

1312
00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:57.727
Owen:<i> Hey. Daddy.
you're gonna be busy there.</i>

1313
00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.229
Garrett: I know.
It's gonna be really busy.

1314
01:00:00.262 --> 01:00:03.232
All right. hey. I gotta go.
I just wanted to say hi
before the show.

1315
01:00:03.265 --> 01:00:06.102
-<i> Don't go!
- Owen. stop.</i>

1316
01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:09.071
-<i> I don't want to. </i>
- I love you.

1317
01:00:09.104 --> 01:00:12.073
<i> Say "love you."</i>

1318
01:00:12.107 --> 01:00:14.243
-<i> Bye-bye. </i>
- Bye-bye.

1319
01:00:14.276 --> 01:00:17.312
Garrett:<i>
FaceTime's a good thing
and a bad thing. man.</i>

1320
01:00:17.346 --> 01:00:19.749
It's good to be able to
check in and see 'em. you know?

1321
01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:22.251
But then it's like.
man. I wish I was there.

1322
01:00:22.284 --> 01:00:23.620
But...

1323
01:00:27.222 --> 01:00:29.992
Cory:<i>
Leaving our families
behind is rough.</i>

1324
01:00:30.025 --> 01:00:32.061
They really balance
what we do at Dude Perfect.

1325
01:00:32.094 --> 01:00:34.363
<i> I do think they're
kind of the unsung heroes.</i>

1326
01:00:34.396 --> 01:00:37.767
I mean. we're out making
goofy videos and having fun.

1327
01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.369
<i> and most of the time
they're back holding down
the fort.</i>

1328
01:00:40.402 --> 01:00:43.172
It's huge. There's no way
we'd be able to do what
we're doing without them.

1329
01:00:43.205 --> 01:00:45.674
Amy:<i>
Now that we have kids.</i>

1330
01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:48.744
and just obviously trying
to balance that. it's a lot.

1331
01:00:48.777 --> 01:00:52.281
-<i> But he's been the best dad. </i>
- Did you have a good nap?

1332
01:00:52.314 --> 01:00:55.417
<i> He's the first one to say.
"Hey. you go take a break.</i>

1333
01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:57.953
<i>You've been doing this all day.
Let me take over."</i>

1334
01:00:57.986 --> 01:01:00.923
I love you. pumpkin.

1335
01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:02.958
You wanna go see
if we can catch a fish?

1336
01:01:02.991 --> 01:01:04.393
- Yeah.
- Okay. come on.

1337
01:01:04.426 --> 01:01:06.895
Tyler comes home
and he is just Tyler.

1338
01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:08.698
He is not Tyler
from Dude Perfect.

1339
01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:11.400
We got a fish. bud.

1340
01:01:11.433 --> 01:01:14.937
He is Daddy. He's husband.
He's just himself.

1341
01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:17.872
- Whoa!
- A fish!

1342
01:01:17.906 --> 01:01:19.108
- You wanna give him a kiss?
- Yeah.

1343
01:01:19.141 --> 01:01:21.377
Okay. Oh. gross!

1344
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:23.812
- You want Daddy
to give him a kiss?
- Yeah.

1345
01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:26.749
Oh! Slimy fish.

1346
01:01:26.782 --> 01:01:29.151
Tyler:<i> The longer that
you do this. you realize</i>

1347
01:01:29.184 --> 01:01:32.855
<i> you've experienced the success
and the money and the fame.</i>

1348
01:01:32.888 --> 01:01:36.125
and whatever you want to call
that you think people
look for for contentment.

1349
01:01:36.158 --> 01:01:38.828
<i> You just learn somewhere
along the way</i>

1350
01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.863
<i> that there's just more
important things out there.</i>

1351
01:01:40.896 --> 01:01:41.998
Run. run.

1352
01:01:43.799 --> 01:01:47.436
It's safe to say that. like.
home is where I'm happiest.

1353
01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:49.171
<i> Even if it's been a rough day</i>

1354
01:01:49.204 --> 01:01:51.340
<i> and I'm just wiped.
totally exhausted.</i>

1355
01:01:51.373 --> 01:01:54.143
<i> but the minute
I open that door and come home</i>

1356
01:01:54.176 --> 01:01:56.011
<i> and my little daughter
wants to play with her little
invisible friend Sophia</i>

1357
01:01:56.044 --> 01:01:58.013
and feed her tea. I'm down.

1358
01:01:58.046 --> 01:01:59.348
Everything's wiped clean

1359
01:01:59.381 --> 01:02:00.915
and I can go
ten more rounds. baby.

1360
01:02:00.949 --> 01:02:03.886
Are you riding your unicorn?

1361
01:02:03.919 --> 01:02:07.490
Allison:<i>
He's definitely. like. Mr. Dad.</i>

1362
01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:10.192
- Boo!
- Even now. he has
a really great job.

1363
01:02:10.225 --> 01:02:11.961
at the end of the day.
he's coming home and changing
diapers. you know?

1364
01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:15.765
Try not to spill on you.
You okay?

1365
01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:18.901
Kristin:<i>
They just think Daddy just
makes videos for them.</i>

1366
01:02:18.934 --> 01:02:21.504
You know? Daddy goes to work
so we can watch it.

1367
01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:26.942
You want to shoot?
Put it in there. Good job.

1368
01:02:26.975 --> 01:02:29.245
<i> Garrett is such a sweet dad.</i>

1369
01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:31.212
<i> I always love taking pictures</i>

1370
01:02:31.246 --> 01:02:33.382
<i> and videos of him dancing
with the kids.</i>

1371
01:02:33.415 --> 01:02:37.052
<i> He loves dance parties
with them.</i>

1372
01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:39.522
At the end of the day.
those are my true treasures
in life. you know?

1373
01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:40.955
Faith and my family.

1374
01:02:40.989 --> 01:02:43.058
And without those.
I would be lost.

1375
01:02:43.091 --> 01:02:44.326
A lost human being.

1376
01:02:44.359 --> 01:02:46.395
- Bang it.
- Bang it?

1377
01:02:46.428 --> 01:02:49.397
- Yeah. on the-- no. no. no.
- Oh. it worked.

1378
01:02:49.431 --> 01:02:51.901
- Okay. there you go.
- I've never done it that way.

1379
01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:55.237
The morning routine here
probably looks a lot different
than the other guys.

1380
01:02:55.270 --> 01:03:00.409
No kids. so that's
why we make giant casseroles
for the two of us.

1381
01:03:00.442 --> 01:03:02.344
Really stretch it out.

1382
01:03:02.377 --> 01:03:05.948
Coby:<i> We would all agree that
our families are our glue.</i>

1383
01:03:05.981 --> 01:03:09.552
We may question whether
the world's gonna like whatever
new thing we're doing.

1384
01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:13.823
but because we know we have
the support of our wives
and our families.

1385
01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:17.560
it just gives us the power
to go try anything.

1386
01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:20.095
Aubrey:<i>
They worked hard for this.
and so it is fun</i>

1387
01:03:20.128 --> 01:03:21.864
<i> to get to see them
have some success</i>

1388
01:03:21.897 --> 01:03:24.433
and to enjoy it

1389
01:03:24.466 --> 01:03:26.268
and continue to look
to the future

1390
01:03:26.301 --> 01:03:28.604
<i> of what they've built
over the last ten years.</i>

1391
01:03:28.637 --> 01:03:32.942
Oh! Good jump. buddy.
All right!

1392
01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:35.110
- Now Daddy jump.
- Daddy jump the tiger?

1393
01:03:35.143 --> 01:03:36.278
- Yeah.
- All right. come on. Daddy.

1394
01:03:36.311 --> 01:03:37.580
- Okay.
- One. two. three. jump!

1395
01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:41.951
Whoo!
Okay. All right.

1396
01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:45.354
You know. you come home
from a long day of dropping
toilets out of helicopters

1397
01:03:45.387 --> 01:03:47.590
or whatever it might be.

1398
01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:50.359
and maybe you're frustrated
or tired or whatever it is.

1399
01:03:50.392 --> 01:03:53.127
<i> But you walk in that door
and then you have a little boy</i>

1400
01:03:53.161 --> 01:03:55.130
<i> that's running to you
screaming. "Daddy."</i>

1401
01:03:55.163 --> 01:03:56.899
<i> just with his arms open.</i>

1402
01:03:56.932 --> 01:04:00.134
Like. it's crazy.
It just-- yeah.

1403
01:04:00.168 --> 01:04:02.605
I mean. that-- it doesn't matter
what happened that day.

1404
01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:05.140
Like. you just figure out.
like. that's it.

1405
01:04:05.173 --> 01:04:07.176
That's what's
most important to me.

1406
01:04:09.344 --> 01:04:12.081
-<i> Hi. Daddy. </i>
- Hi. buddy.

1407
01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:14.851
You still got your PJs on?

1408
01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:21.490
Allison:<i>
When he's out of town.
like. okay.</i>

1409
01:04:21.523 --> 01:04:24.326
You don't have your buddy. but--

1410
01:04:24.359 --> 01:04:26.328
I'm gonna cry about it.
I'm really proud of him.

1411
01:04:26.361 --> 01:04:28.163
I mean. it's awesome.

1412
01:04:28.196 --> 01:04:32.301
Um. yeah.
Sorry about that.

1413
01:04:32.334 --> 01:04:34.336
Garrett:<i> Knowing that all
of our family and friends</i>

1414
01:04:34.369 --> 01:04:36.605
<i> are back at home
kind of waiting on us</i>

1415
01:04:36.638 --> 01:04:39.275
just gives us that energy
to finish strong.

1416
01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:57.627
That's what 10.000 people
looks like.

1417
01:05:05.667 --> 01:05:07.603
- One. two. three.
- All: 13!

1418
01:05:07.636 --> 01:05:10.172
- Coaster brothers!
- ( screaming )

1419
01:05:10.205 --> 01:05:11.574
( screaming )

1420
01:05:14.209 --> 01:05:16.979
- Three. two. one.
- All: 11!

1421
01:05:19.281 --> 01:05:20.716
He has never eaten a pickle.

1422
01:05:20.749 --> 01:05:22.317
I've avoided them
at all costs.

1423
01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:35.398
Oh. my gosh!
You're so annoying!

1424
01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:57.219
Think I might have
just broke the bus.

1425
01:05:57.252 --> 01:06:00.255
What a cool poster.

1426
01:06:00.288 --> 01:06:02.524
That is cool.

1427
01:06:02.557 --> 01:06:05.593
Oh. wow.
Nice locker room tonight.

1428
01:06:05.627 --> 01:06:08.596
Nice. It's always good
to be filmed when you stop

1429
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:11.433
and take a picture
of yourself in a hallway.

1430
01:06:11.466 --> 01:06:14.203
Thanks. guys.

1431
01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:16.270
Tyler:<i>
When we started Dude Perfect.
one of the most</i>

1432
01:06:16.304 --> 01:06:18.440
frequently heard things
that people told us

1433
01:06:18.473 --> 01:06:20.275
was that you can't work
with your best friends.

1434
01:06:20.308 --> 01:06:23.278
It'll never last.
Just don't even attempt it.

1435
01:06:23.311 --> 01:06:24.480
Hey. Cobes.
how are we looking in there?

1436
01:06:26.381 --> 01:06:28.183
I was literally in line
for the bathroom

1437
01:06:28.216 --> 01:06:29.752
and then he kind of
jacked it from me.

1438
01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:32.120
It's friends running
a business.

1439
01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.123
And it's kind of--
it can be tough.

1440
01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:39.528
'Cause I was the second person
in here waiting.

1441
01:06:39.561 --> 01:06:42.164
Cory:<i>
We've screamed at each other.
I've been in tears before.</i>

1442
01:06:42.197 --> 01:06:44.466
I think we've probably
genuinely quit

1443
01:06:44.499 --> 01:06:47.301
or almost quit six times.

1444
01:06:47.335 --> 01:06:49.238
Tyler:<i>
That's gonna happen when you're
working with your friends.</i>

1445
01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:52.341
<i> but at the end of the day.
you gotta just get past it.</i>

1446
01:06:52.374 --> 01:06:53.509
We've gotten
in plenty of fights.

1447
01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:56.310
and Cody actually
almost killed Cory.

1448
01:06:56.344 --> 01:06:58.447
- Yeah. that's true.
- Threw a boulder at his head.

1449
01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.215
That's true.
It was a classic example

1450
01:07:00.248 --> 01:07:01.583
of somebody's pride
getting in the way.

1451
01:07:01.616 --> 01:07:03.318
<i> We had airsoft guns
at the ranch.</i>

1452
01:07:03.351 --> 01:07:05.187
<i> Somebody shoots somebody.
and then they're like.</i>

1453
01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:06.555
"You're not gonna
do that again."

1454
01:07:06.588 --> 01:07:08.157
Cody's like.
"You don't think
I'll do it again?"

1455
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:10.159
- Shoots Cory point blank.
- Point blank.

1456
01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:12.327
- And Cory--
- Escalates.

1457
01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.396
- Classic example.
- Like me and Cory do.

1458
01:07:14.429 --> 01:07:16.265
Cory takes off running
at some point.

1459
01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:19.167
Cody goes for a rock.
Cody proceeds to throw

1460
01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:22.171
the rock and misses him.

1461
01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.339
I'd like to say by inches.
but it was a good six feet.

1462
01:07:24.372 --> 01:07:26.375
- Yeah.
- It wasn't anything close.

1463
01:07:26.408 --> 01:07:28.410
I want to say
it whizzed right by
by a centimeter.

1464
01:07:28.443 --> 01:07:31.680
- So. no. there's been
some heated arguments.
- Yeah.

1465
01:07:31.713 --> 01:07:34.750
- Attempted murder.
- Attempted murder. yeah.

1466
01:07:34.783 --> 01:07:38.220
- You going with that shirt
for the rest of the shows?
- It's my only purple one.

1467
01:07:38.253 --> 01:07:39.455
- Yeah.
- Do you like it?

1468
01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:41.290
- No. but...
- Is it okay?

1469
01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:44.259
It's just
one of my least favorite
shirts we're ever made.

1470
01:07:44.292 --> 01:07:47.096
- Okay. well.
- The purple and the green
is just not--

1471
01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:49.531
- Purple goes with yellow.
not green.
- What do you want me to do?

1472
01:07:49.564 --> 01:07:52.366
- Do you have
another purple shirt?
- I don't. personally.

1473
01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.403
I can't believe you don't
like this shirt. man.

1474
01:07:54.436 --> 01:07:56.205
I'll say this.
Working with friends and family

1475
01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:58.272
is the hardest thing
I've ever done or will do.

1476
01:07:58.306 --> 01:08:00.542
<i> But we do have that faith
that we share</i>

1477
01:08:00.575 --> 01:08:03.544
<i> that I might feel a lot
of anger towards you right now.</i>

1478
01:08:03.578 --> 01:08:05.714
but. you know. I still love you.
and you're still my brother.

1479
01:08:05.747 --> 01:08:08.484
and we know how to forgive
and just move on.

1480
01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:11.553
- All right.
- Thank you so much.

1481
01:08:11.586 --> 01:08:14.857
- Have fun tonight.
- Special fan. Teacher.

1482
01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:18.393
Steve uses all of your
videos to teach with.

1483
01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:21.597
- Teacher Steve.
- I've been using you guys
since you've been around.

1484
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:23.732
There you go.
Teacher Steve doing us favors.

1485
01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:25.901
- Since you're brothers
in Christ-- awesome.
- Yes.

1486
01:08:25.934 --> 01:08:28.137
- That's awesome. man.
- I never have to worry
about your content.

1487
01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.404
Don't have to worry
about what goes on.
I can show everything.

1488
01:08:30.438 --> 01:08:32.341
<i> We're all strong Christians.</i>

1489
01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:34.209
<i> I think that's probably one
of the things that binds us.</i>

1490
01:08:34.242 --> 01:08:37.246
If we lost everything tomorrow.
it doesn't matter.

1491
01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.581
We know that the most important
thing we have is Jesus.

1492
01:08:39.613 --> 01:08:41.750
And so it's very important
to Dude Perfect

1493
01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:44.286
and the decisions we make
and the content we produce.

1494
01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:46.588
- These dudes are awesome.
- That's the only thing
that we all watch together.

1495
01:08:46.621 --> 01:08:48.757
- Yes. Good job.
- That's the only show--

1496
01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:50.591
And I don't have
to worry about what
you're saying or doing.

1497
01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:52.627
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks for watching. guys.

1498
01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:54.429
- Appreciate it.
- We're essentially
the equivalent of Elmo.

1499
01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:57.766
- We're annoying.
but we're clean.
- Yeah.

1500
01:08:57.799 --> 01:08:59.868
Coby:<i> I think making content
that was family-friendly</i>

1501
01:08:59.901 --> 01:09:02.437
came initially from
our faith in Jesus.

1502
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:05.240
We felt like that was something
we really truly wanted to do.

1503
01:09:05.273 --> 01:09:08.377
Tyler:<i>
Faith is really the underlying
principle and theme</i>

1504
01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.245
behind everything
Dude Perfect does.

1505
01:09:10.278 --> 01:09:12.447
( cheering )

1506
01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:14.282
What's up. my man?

1507
01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:16.785
- Good to see you.
- It's great to see you. man.

1508
01:09:16.818 --> 01:09:19.922
Man:<i> Four years ago.
Make-A-Wish lined everything up
with Dude Perfect.</i>

1509
01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:22.823
They were open to do
whatever Kash wanted to do.

1510
01:09:22.857 --> 01:09:24.792
- How we doing. buddy?
Doing good?
- Good. Yeah.

1511
01:09:24.826 --> 01:09:26.795
Glad you guys came out.
This is awesome.

1512
01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:29.698
<i> We had a tremendous time
with those guys.</i>

1513
01:09:29.731 --> 01:09:34.635
And truly.
they are great guys on TV.
but better guys in person.

1514
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:37.305
You guys have been so
instrumental in granting wishes

1515
01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:39.308
over the past
three and a half to four years

1516
01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:42.311
that you've granted 24 wishes.

1517
01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:45.647
and I will tell you firsthand
that's 24 kiddos and families

1518
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.950
- that have truly been touched.
- Thank you.

1519
01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:51.953
So in honor of that.
I'm honored to be here with Kash

1520
01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:56.792
to present you with the 2019
Chris Greicius Celebrity Award.

1521
01:09:56.825 --> 01:09:58.961
- Wow. thank you.
- Thank you. guys.

1522
01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:02.264
John:<i>
Chris Greicius Celebrity Award
goes to one celebrity a year.</i>

1523
01:10:02.297 --> 01:10:05.634
<i> and it's to honor a celebrity
who goes above and beyond.</i>

1524
01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:08.604
And this year. Dude Perfect
was selected to receive

1525
01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:11.005
the 2019 Chris Greicius Award.

1526
01:10:11.039 --> 01:10:14.343
This is truly an honor.
and everything we get to do

1527
01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:16.678
with Make-A-Wish
is absolutely awesome.

1528
01:10:16.711 --> 01:10:18.981
We have a great time every time
you guys are in town.

1529
01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:21.984
So we're honored to be a part
of something like this.

1530
01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:23.751
These are awesome
memories here.

1531
01:10:23.785 --> 01:10:26.688
Yeah. you guys went over
and above

1532
01:10:26.721 --> 01:10:29.625
spending time with us
when we were out there.

1533
01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:32.294
and it's something
that we all will never forget.

1534
01:10:32.327 --> 01:10:36.698
And that is worth more to us
than you guys will understand.

1535
01:10:36.731 --> 01:10:39.268
Thank you. man.
That means a lot.

1536
01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:41.970
Coby:<i> Feels like a huge
opportunity that's just been
placed in our lap.</i>

1537
01:10:42.003 --> 01:10:45.607
And. yeah. just feels like
something we don't want to blow.

1538
01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.876
- Whoa.
- What's up. guys?

1539
01:10:47.909 --> 01:10:51.379
- What's up. guys?
- What is up. everybody?

1540
01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:53.714
- What's up. guys?
How are y'all?
- Look at this crew.

1541
01:10:53.748 --> 01:10:55.851
- How's it going?
- What's up. guys?

1542
01:10:55.884 --> 01:11:00.622
We want to use the opportunity
to do something meaningful.

1543
01:11:00.655 --> 01:11:03.659
Spin that wheel!

1544
01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:05.761
- That was a good spin.
- Great spin.

1545
01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:07.763
Garrett:<i>
I think we all love what we do.</i>

1546
01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:10.732
<i> but we all know
that there's something more</i>

1547
01:11:10.765 --> 01:11:13.735
<i> than just our own happiness.
our own satisfaction.</i>

1548
01:11:13.768 --> 01:11:15.504
<i> and that's to give back.</i>

1549
01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:17.673
<i> And one of the outlets
that we do that</i>

1550
01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:20.375
<i> is going to visit
some kids in need.</i>

1551
01:11:20.408 --> 01:11:23.045
<i> that just are having
a hard time in life</i>

1552
01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:25.414
and need to put a smile
on their face.

1553
01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:30.419
Cody has voluntarily
asked for a chocolate
out of the bedpan. y'all.

1554
01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:35.457
- All: Eww!
- I felt like I got off easy.
I owe it to the people.

1555
01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:37.793
It's just ginger ale.
It's fine.

1556
01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:40.762
I'm not touching it.
You gotta reach in there
and grab it.

1557
01:11:40.795 --> 01:11:42.931
Oh. gosh. Oh.

1558
01:11:42.964 --> 01:11:47.102
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1559
01:11:47.135 --> 01:11:50.472
- I can't.
- Oh!

1560
01:11:50.505 --> 01:11:54.643
- You splashed it on me.
- That's so gross.

1561
01:11:54.676 --> 01:11:57.079
Tyler:<i> To think that
we can have some small part</i>

1562
01:11:57.112 --> 01:12:00.449
<i> in bringing joy
or even a smile to a child</i>

1563
01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:03.085
<i> or a family's face
that's going through
a difficult time</i>

1564
01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:06.488
<i> is such an unbelievable gift
that we can give people</i>

1565
01:12:06.521 --> 01:12:08.456
<i> that we feel
not even worthy to bring.</i>

1566
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.791
but it's a blessing to be able
to do that for somebody.

1567
01:12:10.825 --> 01:12:13.495
and it's such
a small gesture on our part.

1568
01:12:13.528 --> 01:12:15.130
Flip.

1569
01:12:15.163 --> 01:12:18.099
( cheering )

1570
01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:19.934
- You're in the finals.
- Good job. buddy.

1571
01:12:23.037 --> 01:12:24.973
It all comes down to this.

1572
01:12:25.006 --> 01:12:27.976
This moment will echo
in eternity.

1573
01:12:28.009 --> 01:12:32.080
- ( cheering )
- A new champion!

1574
01:12:32.113 --> 01:12:34.683
Tyler:<i> Once you see these kids
and what they're going through.</i>

1575
01:12:34.716 --> 01:12:36.651
<i> knowing that you have
the ability to bring them</i>

1576
01:12:36.684 --> 01:12:40.489
just some small amount of hope
is such an easy lift for us.

1577
01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.023
It's such a no-brainer.

1578
01:12:42.056 --> 01:12:44.492
So. remember that kid
that bought tickets?

1579
01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:46.995
Meyer is his name.
He just got diagnosed
with leukemia.

1580
01:12:47.028 --> 01:12:48.830
- Oh. yeah.
- The doctor told him.

1581
01:12:48.863 --> 01:12:50.499
"I don't think you should go
to the show."

1582
01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:52.000
Cody:<i> If Meyer
can't be at the show.</i>

1583
01:12:52.033 --> 01:12:53.535
it's our job
to bring the show to him.

1584
01:12:55.937 --> 01:12:59.407
All: What's up. Meyer?

1585
01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:02.144
We're here with Meyer.
Meyer. pound it. Noggin.
Right here. buddy.

1586
01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:04.612
Yes. Brought our
tour bus to him.

1587
01:13:04.646 --> 01:13:06.615
First things first.
when you get on the bus.

1588
01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:09.684
you gotta grab you
one of those just to kind of
snack on during the tour.

1589
01:13:09.717 --> 01:13:14.022
- This is where they sleep.
- Make sure you show him my bed.

1590
01:13:14.055 --> 01:13:16.024
- I did.
- Okay. good.

1591
01:13:16.057 --> 01:13:20.695
- This is their gaming room.
- Oh. their gaming room.

1592
01:13:20.728 --> 01:13:25.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Wow. I love
the confidence. buddy.

1593
01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:28.036
Cody:<i> Getting the chance
to rub shoulders with
a family like Meyer's</i>

1594
01:13:28.069 --> 01:13:31.873
<i> and to get to bring a smile
to his face and just have
that interaction</i>

1595
01:13:31.906 --> 01:13:34.476
just means the world to us.
It's unbelievable.

1596
01:13:34.509 --> 01:13:36.678
So if you were
gonna be at the show.
this is how it would work.

1597
01:13:36.711 --> 01:13:38.713
I'd be like. "Hey. welcome
our special guest Meyer."

1598
01:13:38.746 --> 01:13:42.784
- Bang. Okay. he comes up.
- All: Oh!

1599
01:13:42.817 --> 01:13:44.886
- I gotta make mine.
- Come on. Ty.

1600
01:13:44.919 --> 01:13:50.724
- Oh. Meyer!
- And the winner of
the ping-pong championship.

1601
01:13:50.758 --> 01:13:54.563
- Bro. you don't need to--
- All: Oh!

1602
01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:57.199
If you do this long enough.
you realize that there's

1603
01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:59.034
just so much more to life

1604
01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:00.735
than trying to fill up
a stadium...

1605
01:14:00.768 --> 01:14:02.137
- One.
- Bang!

1606
01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:04.039
- Nice.
- Got him.

1607
01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:06.942
<i> ...or make a video that hits
a certain number of views.</i>

1608
01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:09.077
It's the stuff
like we did with Meyer

1609
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:11.746
or these other kids
at the hospital along this tour

1610
01:14:11.779 --> 01:14:14.115
that have just reminded us of
what's most important in life.

1611
01:14:14.148 --> 01:14:16.585
Oh. Lord.
we just pray for Meyer.

1612
01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:19.221
and we're really grateful
for the chance to hang out
with him and his family.

1613
01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:22.124
And we thank you for his
parents and for Macy.

1614
01:14:24.692 --> 01:14:27.596
And we're just really grateful
to be friends with him now.

1615
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:31.599
And we pray that
we would get to see him
the next time we're in town.

1616
01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:34.769
We love you so much.
and we thank you.
Jesus. for Meyer.

1617
01:14:34.802 --> 01:14:36.804
- In your name we pray. amen.
- All: Amen.

1618
01:14:36.838 --> 01:14:40.209
Pound it. Noggin. See ya!

1619
01:14:42.143 --> 01:14:43.879
<i> We know we have
a huge opportunity</i>

1620
01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:45.614
and a big platform to steward.

1621
01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:47.616
and so we've created
the Dude Perfect Foundation

1622
01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.117
just as a way
to encourage other people

1623
01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:50.951
to jump on board with us
and love on these kids

1624
01:14:50.985 --> 01:14:53.255
they way we've had a chance to.

1625
01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:55.624
Just to let you guys know.
a little bit earlier today.

1626
01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:56.758
we went to a young man's house.

1627
01:14:56.791 --> 01:14:58.093
His name is Meyer.

1628
01:14:58.126 --> 01:14:59.761
and he was not able
to be here tonight.

1629
01:14:59.794 --> 01:15:00.829
so we want you guys
to help us out.

1630
01:15:00.862 --> 01:15:02.631
So. six years old.

1631
01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:04.232
Cody is gonna start us off.

1632
01:15:04.265 --> 01:15:07.536
When we turn it to you guys.
as loud as you were for us.

1633
01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:10.305
I need you to be
times ten for Meyer.

1634
01:15:10.338 --> 01:15:11.973
Meyer. what do you do. baby?

1635
01:15:12.006 --> 01:15:14.075
It's Cody. Ty. Garrett.
me. and Cory!

1636
01:15:14.108 --> 01:15:15.644
And guess what!

1637
01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:18.647
We have about 8.000
more favorite people

1638
01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.550
- here for you. buddy!
- Yeah!

1639
01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:26.021
( cheering )

1640
01:15:27.021 --> 01:15:30.692
Look at 'em! That's loud!

1641
01:15:30.725 --> 01:15:33.662
Thank you. You're the man.

1642
01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:37.197
- We love you. buddy!
- We're praying for you. buddy!

1643
01:15:37.231 --> 01:15:39.601
Get well soon.
Thinking about you.

1644
01:15:39.634 --> 01:15:41.169
Hope you're having
a great night.

1645
01:15:41.202 --> 01:15:42.671
Later. buddy.
Pound it. Noggin.

1646
01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:43.871
- Thank you. guys.
- See ya!

1647
01:15:46.207 --> 01:15:49.844
Thank you so much.
Thank y'all.

1648
01:15:49.877 --> 01:15:51.846
Look at this posse.
How are y'all?

1649
01:15:51.879 --> 01:15:54.849
Okay. cool.
Hey. you win some.
you lose some.

1650
01:15:54.882 --> 01:15:57.318
- Oh. wow.
- That was cold-blooded
is what that was.

1651
01:15:57.352 --> 01:16:01.022
- That's messed up.
- That was bad.

1652
01:16:01.055 --> 01:16:03.858
- How are y'all?
It's so good to--
- So it's the last stretch.

1653
01:16:03.891 --> 01:16:06.594
So we have Austin.
and then we're finishing
with two in Dallas.

1654
01:16:06.628 --> 01:16:09.097
<i> You know I would be there.
but I need to do training.</i>

1655
01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:11.666
- Ahh!
-<i> Been watching y'all
all day long.</i>

1656
01:16:11.699 --> 01:16:15.103
That's awesome.
We gotta do a second video.
CP3 edition.

1657
01:16:15.136 --> 01:16:17.238
Tyler:<i> I think we all know
that we're getting close.</i>

1658
01:16:17.271 --> 01:16:19.040
<i> The tour is coming to an end.</i>

1659
01:16:19.073 --> 01:16:22.210
And I'm not gonna lie.
we're pretty excited.

1660
01:16:22.243 --> 01:16:24.879
Excited to see my family
and excited to perform

1661
01:16:24.912 --> 01:16:26.948
in front of our home crowd.

1662
01:16:26.981 --> 01:16:28.883
<i> We're on the home stretch now.</i>

1663
01:16:28.916 --> 01:16:30.652
Coby:<i> I think
it's been really fun.</i>

1664
01:16:30.685 --> 01:16:32.654
<i> It absolutely is tiring
at times. but overall.</i>

1665
01:16:32.687 --> 01:16:33.722
<i> I would look back on these
five weeks and be like.</i>

1666
01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:35.223
"Yeah. that was a ton of fun."

1667
01:16:35.256 --> 01:16:39.894
- I'm super glad we did it.
- Give it up for Gary!

1668
01:16:39.927 --> 01:16:41.161
You do something random
for a week.

1669
01:16:41.195 --> 01:16:42.230
and then you have
all these stories

1670
01:16:42.263 --> 01:16:43.898
<i> to talk about for a long time.</i>

1671
01:16:43.931 --> 01:16:46.166
<i> I feel like that's what
this is like for us.</i>

1672
01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.737
Garrett:<i> Honestly.
it's gonna be kind of
weird when it's over.</i>

1673
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:49.838
<i> I definitely
wouldn't have said that</i>

1674
01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:51.373
<i> before we started the show.</i>

1675
01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:52.774
but I don't think
it could have gone better.

1676
01:16:57.779 --> 01:17:00.382
Oh. my goodness.
This is literally it.

1677
01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:01.816
I'm on top of the world.

1678
01:17:01.849 --> 01:17:04.753
T-minus just a few hours
and we done.

1679
01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:07.856
- Oh!
- Hi.

1680
01:17:14.128 --> 01:17:15.630
Hey. guess what.

1681
01:17:17.231 --> 01:17:18.800
I love you.

1682
01:17:23.137 --> 01:17:25.740
Cody:<i> It's weird to say this.
but I honestly feel like</i>

1683
01:17:25.773 --> 01:17:27.375
<i> we just went through
19 rehearsals...</i>

1684
01:17:27.408 --> 01:17:28.777
- For tonight. I agree.
- ...for tonight's show.

1685
01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.045
because this is all
friends and family.

1686
01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:31.413
Sophia here. too.

1687
01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:32.747
Oh. Sophia's here. too?

1688
01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:34.416
Yeah. coming to see you. too.

1689
01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:35.950
Oh. she's coming
to see me. too?

1690
01:17:35.983 --> 01:17:37.118
- Yeah.
- Sophia didn't have a ticket.

1691
01:17:37.151 --> 01:17:38.952
but they let her through.

1692
01:17:38.986 --> 01:17:41.289
- She's a princess.
- We got some groupies.

1693
01:17:41.322 --> 01:17:43.458
Most of them are related to me.
They're stacking up.

1694
01:17:43.491 --> 01:17:45.160
That's really funny.

1695
01:17:46.994 --> 01:17:48.029
You're funny.

1696
01:17:48.062 --> 01:17:50.165
I couldn't be more excited.

1697
01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:51.800
I feel so supported.

1698
01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:53.134
Coby:<i>
Between the five of us.</i>

1699
01:17:53.167 --> 01:17:55.203
<i> we have 200 guests
coming tonight.</i>

1700
01:17:55.236 --> 01:17:58.840
It's gonna be a strong section.
Hometown. Let's go.

1701
01:18:00.408 --> 01:18:02.310
Tyler:<i> It's one thing to do
this live tour</i>

1702
01:18:02.343 --> 01:18:04.713
<i> in front of a bunch of fans
that we've never met in person.</i>

1703
01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.481
but it's weirdly stressful
to do it in front of

1704
01:18:06.514 --> 01:18:08.850
friends and family that you've
known for your whole life.

1705
01:18:08.883 --> 01:18:12.120
Cory:<i> We got one more show
to go here in Dallas.</i>

1706
01:18:12.153 --> 01:18:14.789
<i> and I feel like
it's taken up to this point</i>

1707
01:18:14.822 --> 01:18:16.891
for me to really realize
how special this has been.

1708
01:18:16.924 --> 01:18:20.829
Just on behalf of the dudes.
like. we do not overlook

1709
01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.964
all of the work that
takes place behind the scenes.

1710
01:18:22.997 --> 01:18:24.365
I know we've talked
about it a lot.

1711
01:18:24.398 --> 01:18:26.334
We get to come out here
and be on stage

1712
01:18:26.367 --> 01:18:27.969
and people cheer for us.

1713
01:18:28.002 --> 01:18:29.838
but you guys don't necessarily
get to experience that.

1714
01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.206
And we seriously
do appreciate it.

1715
01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:32.741
This has been a blast for us.

1716
01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:34.008
So we really do appreciate
all y'all's hard work.

1717
01:18:34.041 --> 01:18:35.143
It's meant a ton to us.

1718
01:18:35.176 --> 01:18:37.245
Three. two. one.

1719
01:18:37.278 --> 01:18:39.047
( cheering )

1720
01:18:46.287 --> 01:18:48.390
I don't know.
That's a pretty good carve job.

1721
01:18:50.558 --> 01:18:53.194
- Must be a mold.
- It's the perfect font. too.

1722
01:18:53.227 --> 01:18:55.397
It's just impressive.
It's a work of art.

1723
01:18:57.532 --> 01:19:02.036
What up. dude? What is this?

1724
01:19:02.069 --> 01:19:04.405
Wow. what a throwback.

1725
01:19:04.438 --> 01:19:07.008
( laughter )

1726
01:19:07.041 --> 01:19:10.078
This is the guy I want to
always be remembered by.

1727
01:19:10.111 --> 01:19:14.182
Welcome to the show.
Yeah. look over there.
It's even worse.

1728
01:19:14.215 --> 01:19:17.218
- ( laughter )
- That was a good look.

1729
01:19:17.251 --> 01:19:19.154
I'm telling you right now.
I just look back and say.

1730
01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:21.856
"Boy. I chose some
weird friends."

1731
01:19:21.889 --> 01:19:24.893
I just cannot believe
I did that in any sort
of a serious way.

1732
01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:27.061
- but it happened.
- Yeah. Words escape me.

1733
01:19:27.094 --> 01:19:30.131
- Oh. that's my honeymoon.
- That was your honeymoon?

1734
01:19:30.164 --> 01:19:33.535
- Thought I was so cool.
- My friendship with Garrett
has lasted a long time.

1735
01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:35.537
- ( overlapping chatter )
- Hey. well done.

1736
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:39.072
- What do we think?
- That was very good. Dude.

1737
01:19:39.106 --> 01:19:42.076
Everyone pulls pranks.
so we took it easy
on y'all this time.

1738
01:19:42.109 --> 01:19:43.978
Yeah. just I'm glad
y'all found humor in it.

1739
01:19:44.011 --> 01:19:45.480
Thanks. team. Well done.

1740
01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:49.551
Let's go get mic'ed up
and break it out one more time.

1741
01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:51.119
- Oh. wow.
- One show left.

1742
01:20:04.131 --> 01:20:07.402
Cory:<i> I mean. to me.
Dude Perfect is the five of us.</i>

1743
01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:10.438
It's like a family.
I mean. it really is.
We're brothers.

1744
01:20:10.471 --> 01:20:12.440
<i> We've been together
for 12 years in real life.</i>

1745
01:20:12.473 --> 01:20:14.943
<i> ten years as a business.</i>

1746
01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:17.579
I can tell you there is nothing
that we would rather be doing

1747
01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:19.447
than exactly
what we're doing right now.

1748
01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.615
One more.

1749
01:20:20.648 --> 01:20:23.117
- Three. two. one.
- All: One!

1751

1755
01:20:41.435 --> 01:20:43.471
People always ask us. like.
how long can we do this?

1756
01:20:43.504 --> 01:20:46.541
And I-- I don't see a reason
we'd ever stop.

1757
01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:53.514
Tonight is a very special night
for us because we get to be

1758
01:20:53.547 --> 01:20:55.983
back here in our hometown
with our friends and family.

1759
01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:57.986
We cannot thank you guys enough.

1760
01:20:58.019 --> 01:21:00.889
I would like to welcome
the DP wives.

1761
01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:03.090
These are the women that
allow us to go on the road

1762
01:21:03.124 --> 01:21:05.994
and make silly videos
for you guys.

1763
01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.595
and we want to give them
a big welcome.

1764
01:21:07.628 --> 01:21:09.496
so please give it up for 'em.

1765
01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:11.199
( cheering )

1766
01:21:11.232 --> 01:21:14.602
Maybe the secret sauce
to this whole Dude Perfect thing

1767
01:21:14.635 --> 01:21:17.505
<i> has just been five buddies
having a blast.</i>

1771
01:21:26.447 --> 01:21:29.617
I personally think
it works because there's
five different people.

1772
01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:32.019
We're not all the same.
We all bring
something different.

1773
01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:33.388
We all keep
each other balanced.

01:21:55.242 --> 01:21:57.378
But I feel like Dude Perfect
is an opportunity

1779
01:21:57.411 --> 01:21:59.547
to do something meaningful.

1780

more than anything.

1791
01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:23.471
