We were sitting at the pool

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.856
just sunbathing and talking.

6
00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.775
I was a young gay man who was

7
00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.903
questioning
all kinds of things.

8
00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.948
We talked about being gay
in Hollywood

9
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.326
and how difficult
it was to have a career.

10
00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:40.165
And I asked him how he knew
that he was gonna make it.

11
00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.501
because I wasn't sure
that I ever would.

12
00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.504
And he told me about
a dream that he had.

13
00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:50.675
He dreamt that there was
a perfectly cut diamond

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:54.179
sitting on velvet

15
00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.144
in a room that was lit
with pin spots.

16
00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.229
And every one of the lights

17
00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:07.859
were pointed into the center
of the diamond.

He said. "That's the dream

"that made me believe
that I could do this.

22
00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.958

I was gonna be a star."

Not only was he

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.168
the biggest star
at Universal.

40
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.752

"That's the man I want
to marry."

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:31.776

"That's the man
I'd like to be."

McGillin:
He was like a granite facade.

51
00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.489
just impenetrable.

Maupin: I thought I was
the last man in California

61
00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:58.345
to go to bed with Rock Hudson
when I finally did.

62
00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.638
He was a sort
of sexual gladiator.

63
00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.975
The lash for you.
betrayer of women.

64
00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.643
David Thomson:
He was closeted.

65
00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.146
but there was every reason
to be closeted back then.

66
00:03:08.228 --> 00:03:11.691
If the truth had come out.
that would've been
the end of his career.

67
00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.735
It's as simple as that.

68
00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:16.654
Kevoian:
The public perception of Rock

69
00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.991
was so very masculine
and straight.

70
00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.077
Privately. he was very free.

71
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.704
Carol Burnett:
He loved to laugh.
He was also a bit of a devil.

72
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.833
Ken Jillson:
The people that
he had around him

73
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.211
were very trusted friends.

74
00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:33.463
I think maybe that's the key.

75
00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:35.048
Shayne:
People loved him. you know?

76
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:38.510
He was just a decent.
wonderful guy.

77
00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.762
And that's unusual
in Hollywood.

78
00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:44.015
I hate to say that.
but it's true.

79
00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.063
He was a quiet man.

80
00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:53.692

I most remember him for
were his silences.

He lived as if he were

This is an interview
with actor Rock Hudson

taped in his home
in Beverly Hills. California.

118
00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:46.638
on August 24th. 1983.

119
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.765
Well. I'm wondering.
first of all.

120
00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.433
how an Illinois boy
like yourself

121
00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.477
became interested in acting.

122
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.604
Hudson: I wanted to be
an actor all my life.

123
00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:57.941
That has always
hypnotized me.

124
00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:00.235
Davis: Did you have
acting training as a boy?

125
00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:03.738
Hudson:
No. I could never freely say.

126
00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.824
"I'm going to be an actor
when I grow up."

127
00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:06.825
Davis:
Yeah.

128
00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.493
Hudson:
Because that's sissy stuff.

129
00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.453
You oughta be a policeman
or a fireman.

130
00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.747
So I never said anything.
Kept my mouth shut.

131
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.500
Nor did I enter in
the drama society
or anything like that.

132
00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.335
I had to work all the time.
so I couldn't do

133
00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.796
any form
of extracurricular activity.

134
00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:21.589
I had to make
a living for myself.

135
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:23.717
And then I went in the Navy
in World War II

136
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.593
and went back home
for a summer.

137
00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:28.346
and I thought.
"This place is not for me.

138
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.182
Now is the time
to do what I want to do."

139
00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:33.685
(mellow jazz music)

140
00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:37.689
I did know one person
in Los Angeles.

141
00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:38.606
my father.

142
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.691
My parents divorced.

143
00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.776
and so he was living out here.

144
00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.278
So I came out

145
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.738
and stayed with him.

146
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.574
It was very difficult for me
to make friends out here.

147
00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:48.783
Then I got to know

148
00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:51.411
a guy who was
an older brother

149
00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:54.247
of a guy
I was overseas with.

150
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.665
And it was one of those things.

151
00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:57.792
"If you're ever in Los Angeles.
look me up."

152
00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.461
So I called him and he said.

153
00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:00.879
"Come on up
for Sunday dinner."

154
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.798
So I did. met his brother.
who lived in Long Beach.

155
00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.718
who used to be a radio
producer.

156
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.219
He began inviting me down

157
00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.055
to his place down in Long
Beach.

158
00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.349
We became best friends.

159
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.976
Richard Hodge:
Kenneth Hodge was my uncle.

160
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.519
A man of the arts.

161
00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:20.023
Somebody that really loved
to help people.

162
00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.525
It was never. ever spoken of

163
00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.569
that. you know.
he might be gay.

164
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:27.781
I'd never heard that word
at that point in time.

165
00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:31.159
Being gay was considered.
you know. a neurosis.

166
00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:35.538
It was just a subject that.
uh. that was off the table.

167
00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:39.376
Rock was just getting
out of the Navy

168
00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:42.087
and hadn't been
into the pictures yet.

169
00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.130
So Kenneth was really
enthralled with him

170
00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:49.052
and was sort of
"love at first sight."
I think for. for Ken.

171
00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:52.389
They were very much lovers.

172
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.808
Kenneth had
a big Hollywood job.

173
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.435
He was a director in radio.
and he had a good network.

174
00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.939
He had plenty of people
to introduce Rock to.

175
00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:06.111
and he helped facilitate
some of Rock's early career.

176
00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.739
Hudson: He suggested that
I get some pictures taken

177
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:11.616
and send them
around to agents.

178
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.951
I said. "What's an agent?"

179
00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:16.246
Now I'm Midwestern hick.
Please understand.

180
00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.081
Not knowing anything at all.

181
00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:22.210
Anyway. I had one response.
that's all.

182
00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.795
And that was Henry Willson.

183
00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.463
Davis:
Is that right?

184
00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.966
Hodge:
Rock was very ambitious.

185
00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.927
He got scooped up
with a big-time agent

186
00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:34.764
who really
accelerated Rock's career.

187
00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.975
And from what I know is.

188
00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:40.227
he kind of dropped Ken
on the spot.

189
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.690
I think it ended
really abruptly.

190
00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:50.196
I never really saw my uncle
in love again.

191
00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.367
And I think Rock
broke his heart.

192
00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.661
(audience applauding)

193
00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:59.372
(indistinct chatter)

194
00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:02.917
And the fella sitting
next to you in the audience
down there.

195
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.836
there's the man
who gave you that name.

196
00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.547
your good friend
and personal manager.
Mr. Henry Willson.

197
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.300
Henry. stand up. please.
let the folks see you.

198
00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:12.177
(Rock laughing)

199
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.180
Matter of fact. uh.
Henry discovered Rock

200
00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.974
and fostered
his rapid rise in pictures.

201
00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:19.184
Hudson:
Mm-hmm.

202
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.936
Hofler: In the '40s.
Henry Willson went to work

203
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.564
for David O. Selznick
right after David O. Selznick

204
00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.691
finished
"Gone With the Wind."

205
00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:29.194
Henry and Rock met at a party

206
00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:34.532
that this boyfriend-agent
of Rock's took him to.

207
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.160
Rock realized.
"I'm going with the guy

208
00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:40.663
who's the head of talent
for Selznick Studios!"

209
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.540
So Rock was
one of his first clients.

210
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.211
and there were dozens
of other men

211
00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.880
who have been
completely forgotten.

212
00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:52.759
who had crazy names
like "Race Gentry."

213
00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.220
You only have to look
at the silent movies.

214
00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:58.807
where you would have
these men like Ramon Novarro

215
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.767
or Rudolph Valentino.

216
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.395
And they were considered
way too effeminate

217
00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.397
by the late '30s.

218
00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.566
As we come out
of World War II.

219
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.611
our icons.
particularly in the movies.

220
00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.822
become more butch.

221
00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:16.157
A more masculine man

222
00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:19.369
in the stereotypical way
took over.

223
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:23.206
There were
all these photographs
of soldiers and sailors.

224
00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:27.460
And so that kind of
upped the ante of

225
00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:32.090
this macho quality
that people wanted
in a movie star.

226
00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:36.636
And so the physique
became more important

227
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.141
and you had more
taking off of the shirt.

228
00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:45.395
And that's where
Henry Willson
really came in.

229
00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:48.481
He groomed the male stars

230
00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:51.776
to be more butch. frankly.

231
00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.486
And he did it with.

232
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.988
you know.
a number of these guys

233
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.823
who were ex-soldiers
and sailors.

234
00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.950
and Rock Hudson
was one of them.

235
00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:01.619
-Actress: You are divine.
-I know. but I'm in training.

236

(women laughing)

237
00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:05.123
Hudson:
So then I started

238
00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.958
going to class
and going to diction lessons.

239
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.501
learning how
to lower my voice.

240
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:09.919
learning how
to horseback ride.

241
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.629
learning anything I could.

242
00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:16.801
'cause something
within this Midwestern
hick stupidity of mine

243
00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.554
told me that if you're
gonna do something. do it.

244
00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.348
and do it the best you can
and learn.

245
00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.433
I knew that. at least.

246
00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:27.354
Mark Griffin: Henry Willson
was very shrewd in knowing

247
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.273
that if there is even
a trace of effeminacy.

248
00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.817
whether it's a giggle
or a flutter.

249
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.944
that that's going
to read on screen.

250
00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:37.864
Hofler:
He showed them how
to do their hair.

251
00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.657
what to wear. all of that.

252
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.660
You know. he was a real
grooming school.

253
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:46.706
He taught them
how to be heterosexual.

254
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:51.044
(jazz singer vocalizing)

255
00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.549
Griffin: So. Kathleen.
I wanted to begin by asking

256
00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:59.594
about the screen test
that you appeared in with Rock.

257
00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.179
-Kathleen Hughes: Oh. yes.
-(knocking)

258
00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.306
Griffin: I was just wondering.
had you met Rock

259
00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.558
prior to appearing
in the test with him?

260
00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:07.185
Hughes:
No. I hadn't.

261
00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.479
Griffin: What was your
initial impression of him?

262
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:12.190
Hughes: Well. he was
certainly very handsome...

263
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.693
(laughs)
...no question of that.

264
00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:17.821
And he was very pleasant.
very nice.

265
00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.531
Honey. I'm gonna
tell you something.

Hughes:
He did not appeal to me
as a man or as a date.

269

that we had to do

344
00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:36.913
I do what I like.

345
00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:39.249
And the same thing
goes for you.

346
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.628
And we got music.

347
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.674
(contemplative music)

348
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.975
Griffin: In 1951. Rock meets
fellow actor George Nader

349
00:16:57.058 --> 00:17:02.689
and Nader's long-term partner.
Mark Miller.

350
00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:04.398
And for the next 34 years.

351
00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:07.609
this trio
is virtually inseparable.

352
00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:11.196
The bond is forged through.
you know. things like

353
00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.366
a similar sense of humor

354
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.286
and this tendency
towards mischief.

355
00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:20.623
There's also this shared
misery of the closet.

356
00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:25.337
There are countless lovers.
short-term boyfriends.

357
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:30.675
and weekend flings that pass
through Rock Hudson's life.

358
00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:35.138
But the friendship with Nader
and Miller endured.

359
00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.517
Ain't he the sweetest
player you ever saw?

360
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.353
He is not.

361
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.482
Thomson: I think
that Hudson was regarded

362
00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:49.486
as a big. strong.
handsome guy.

363
00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:53.198
And the natural instinct
was to put him

364
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:56.951
in a lot of cheap
adventure films.

365
00:17:57.035 --> 00:18:00.663
It took time
for the studio to see

366
00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:04.209
that what they really had there

367
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.960
was a subtler actor

368
00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:07.545
than they ever guessed.

369
00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.923
Johash! The horses!

370
00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:13.968
(band playing
"Has Anybody Seen My Gal")

371
00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:15.387
Narrator:
Yes. here they are.

372
00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:17.389
those wild
and wonderful '20s.

373
00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:19.557
the years of speakeasies
and hot jazz.

374
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:23.269
(upbeat jazz music)

375
00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:25.563
(speaking German)

376
00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:40.620
-Will I see you tonight?
-You bet. Millie. 8 o'clock.

377
00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:42.622
-There's a good-- Yes. sir.
-A double bromo.

378
00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.749
One double bromo.
There's a good movie...

379
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:47.419
Laurie: I personally felt
that part was beneath him.

380
00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:49.587
I thought he was miscast.

381
00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:53.091
You know.
he was a 6'4" hunk.

382
00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.969
and to be playing lines

383
00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:58.555
that belonged
in a teenager's mouth.

384
00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:01.099
Watch me!
One strawberry surprise.

385
00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:05.937
Laurie: I just thought
it was beneath him.
and he was a good sport.

386
00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:09.566
Did you know that
in the drugstore scenes. uh...

387
00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.443
Griffin:
Is it the young Jimmy Dean?

388
00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.278
Laurie: Yeah. yeah.
He was sitting
at the counter.

389
00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:15.864
Nobody paid any attention.
nobody knew him then.

390
00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:18.616
Two scoops
of vanilla ice cream.
one mixed up with the rest.

391
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.201
And. uh. one floating.

392
00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:22.162
(moody jazz music)

393
00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:24.456
(Sirk speaking German)

394
00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:58.948
Announcer:
Film producer Ross Hunter.

395
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.826
who not only is one
of the most successful
producers in town.

396
00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:03.787
but one of the best liked.

397
00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:07.040
I believe in. you know.
authenticity. real flowers
and real paintings.

398
00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:10.210
And there's
a million dollars' worth
of jewels here tonight.

399
00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:13.505
Ross Hunter: The studio asked.
"What would you like to do?"

400
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.715
And I said. "Well.
I would like to do something

401
00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:18.301
"that I believe is very much
needed in this industry.

402
00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:19.636
and that is
to bring back glamor."

403
00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:22.347
So I said.
"Let's do some love stories."

404
00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:25.350
(expansive symphonic music)

405
00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:35.235
Douglas Sirk: I only can say
I smelled something

406
00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:37.696
interesting in the film.

407
00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:41.783
Something which
I would call metaphysical.

408
00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:45.203
You know. it's very strange
knowing you only like this.

409
00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:47.580
So well.
it seems. and...

410
00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:49.457
and yet...

411
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:52.419
I've never seen
your face.

412
00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:55.296
Hunter:
The studio thought
my ideas were crazy.

413
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.340
I told them that
I believe strongly

414
00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:59.175
in a man called Rock Hudson.

415
00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:01.886
And I would like to be able

416
00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:05.682
to use him as the young man
in "Magnificent Obsession."

417
00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:09.102
He's a good-looking.
clean-cut man

418
00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:11.479
that young people
all over the world

419
00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:13.356
will fantasize about.

420
00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.402
Oh. I'm so glad
you're here.

421
00:21:17.444 --> 00:21:19.696
You must have known
how much I need you now.

422
00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:21.031
Darling.

423
00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:22.490
Griffin:
Ross Hunter is kind of

424
00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:24.409
the one that clues
into the fact

425
00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:27.370
that Rock is Prince Charming.

426
00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:30.123
You know.
let's put him in some

427
00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:32.876
glossy romantic melodramas.

428
00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.378
That proved to be
the winning formula

429
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.547
for the beginning
of Rock's career.

430
00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:41.217
I love you.
and I wanna marry you.

431
00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.261
Hunter:
Oh. the picture was probably

432
00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:44.888
one of
the biggest moneymakers

433
00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:46.431
that Universal had ever had.

434
00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:49.434
Sirk:
Rock Hudson became a star.

435
00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:52.771
just on account of this film.

436
00:21:52.854 --> 00:21:57.108
Announcer:
Based on votes of moviegoers
all over the nation.

437
00:21:57.192 --> 00:21:58.693
most popular actor
of the year.

438
00:21:58.777 --> 00:22:00.528
(fans chanting "We want Rock!")

439
00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:03.198
Rock. take another bow.
Take another bow.

440
00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:05.950
Take a bow. just take a bow.

441
00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:09.204
(Latin jazz music)

442
00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:12.123
-Aren't you Mrs. Ricky Ricardo?
-Yeah-- Yes.

443
00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:13.917
-Well. I'm Rock Hudson.
-Oh. yeah.

444
00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.544
-Well. I know that.
-(audience laughing)

445
00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:19.089
Announcer:
W ell. this is the second
year in a row

446
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.466
that Mr. Hudson has been
picked by "Modern Screen"

447
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:23.593
as most popular actor.

448
00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:25.637
Top honors for a top star.

449
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.890
(spirited jazz music concludes)

450
00:22:28.932 --> 00:22:31.017
(sweeping romantic music)

451
00:22:39.317 --> 00:22:42.529
But I'd be running away
if I turn my back
on everything I've known.

452
00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:45.699
Ron. Isn't it enough
that we love each other?

453
00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:51.579
No. Cary. it isn't.

454
00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:02.340
Illeana Douglas:
Sirk is German.

455
00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:04.300
He's making these movies

456
00:23:04.342 --> 00:23:10.515
as an outsider
about our American values

457
00:23:10.557 --> 00:23:13.018
and kind of poking holes
in them.

458
00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:15.687
Narrator:
Their lives were worlds apart.

459
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.732
Cary's world was bound
by the country club set.

460
00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:21.609
their smug pretensions
and their spiteful gossip.

461
00:23:21.693 --> 00:23:23.695
Ron's world was boundless.

462
00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:26.239
The great outdoors.
the things that grow

463
00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:28.408
and real people
who give and take

464
00:23:28.491 --> 00:23:29.659
all that heaven allows

465
00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:31.619
of love and happiness.

466
00:23:31.703 --> 00:23:35.331
(upbeat piano
and accordion music)

467
00:23:35.373 --> 00:23:39.085
Douglas:
Sirk created a signature style.

468
00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:41.379
which is. it's so beautiful.

469
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:44.549
but if you look underneath
the surface.

470
00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:46.801
under the white picket
fences.

471
00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:51.890
you're gonna see how torrid
and ugly everything is.

472
00:23:51.973 --> 00:23:54.059
-Howard. you're drunk.
-Why. Cary!

473
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.603
-(glass shatters)
-Isn't one man enough for you?

474
00:23:56.686 --> 00:23:59.230
Maybe you'd better stay
right where you are.

475
00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:01.733
Douglas:
Rock Hudson is just a...

476
00:24:01.816 --> 00:24:06.529
a perfect example
of a male Adonis.

477
00:24:06.571 --> 00:24:11.242
but he's also sensitive.
well-rounded guy.

478
00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:16.081
You know. he's not strictly
a sex object for Jane Wyman.

479
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:22.504
He was the perfect man
for women of that era

480
00:24:22.587 --> 00:24:26.424
that maybe were trapped
in lonely marriages

481
00:24:26.466 --> 00:24:30.303
with insensitive.
unfeeling men.

482
00:24:30.762 --> 00:24:33.598
Look. Mick. I told her
that I love her.

483
00:24:33.682 --> 00:24:35.642
I asked her to marry me.
I can't force her.

484
00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:37.143
She has to make up
her own mind.

485
00:24:37.227 --> 00:24:40.397
She doesn't wanna make up
her own mind. no girl does.

486
00:24:40.438 --> 00:24:42.107
She wants you
to make it up for her.

487
00:24:42.148 --> 00:24:43.817
Come on. let's go.

488
00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:51.032
Douglas:
Rock Hudson is playing
a man called Rock Hudson.

489
00:24:51.116 --> 00:24:57.288
who is the personification
of Americana.

490
00:24:57.372 --> 00:25:01.459
(contemplative music)

491
00:25:01.543 --> 00:25:04.254
The identity
was given to him...

♪♪

493
00:25:06.464 --> 00:25:10.802
...and he slipped into it
and he played it
for the rest of his life.

494
00:25:10.844 --> 00:25:13.013
(contemplative music continues)

495
00:25:20.145 --> 00:25:22.647
Actor:
This is the biggest thing
that's ever happened to you.

496
00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:24.274
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

497
00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:26.609
That's why it was such a hurry
for me to get over here

498
00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:27.777
and clean up your image.

499
00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:29.821
What's wrong
with my image?

500
00:25:29.863 --> 00:25:32.490
You make it sound like
I've just been named
Leper of the Year.

501
00:25:32.574 --> 00:25:34.117
Well. you know
the mentality of that board.

502
00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:35.994
they're hipped on the idea
of a corporate image.

503
00:25:36.036 --> 00:25:38.913
solid American gentry.
family respectability.

504
00:25:38.997 --> 00:25:41.750
For their top executives.
there are not 10 commandments.
only one:

505
00:25:41.833 --> 00:25:44.627
"Thou shalt be married.
happily and respectably
married."

506
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:46.671
-Whether you like it or not.
-That's right.

507
00:25:46.713 --> 00:25:48.340
From now on you're gonna
have a new look.

508
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:50.008
No more gay married bachelor.

509
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:52.677
It's got to be Carter Harrison.

It's like direct
from central casting

00:27:48.543 --> 00:27:50.462
to play Mrs. Rock Hudson.

556
00:27:50.545 --> 00:27:53.423
In November of 1955.

557
00:27:53.465 --> 00:27:55.050
Rock and Phyllis are married

00:28:00.805 --> 00:28:03.308
before Hudson's
30th birthday.

561
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.935
And not surprisingly.
Henry Willson.

562
00:28:05.977 --> 00:28:08.980
the omnipresent.
tended to every detail.

563
00:28:09.022 --> 00:28:11.649
Though he does stop short

564

when they honeymoon
in the Caribbean.

565
00:28:13.985 --> 00:28:16.780
I tend to believe
that it was arranged.

566
00:28:16.863 --> 00:28:20.158
that Henry Willson paired off
an essentially gay man

567
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.995
and a woman rumored to be bi
or gay herself.

568
00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:26.456
Both participants may have
agreed to play house

569
00:28:26.498 --> 00:28:30.251
in the name of keeping
Hudson's career blazing.

570
00:28:30.335 --> 00:28:32.921
Hofler: Oh. it was totally
engineered by Henry.

571
00:28:32.962 --> 00:28:37.967
You know. and the. the thing
that was such a joke about it

572
00:28:38.009 --> 00:28:41.096
is that Rock didn't look
any further

573
00:28:41.179 --> 00:28:43.139
than his agent's
secretary.

574
00:28:44.182 --> 00:28:48.687
Griffin: In some ways.
Rock is the most
successful creation

575
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.939
of that golden age of
Hollywood.

576
00:28:51.022 --> 00:28:54.859
the last of those
really manufactured stars

577
00:28:54.943 --> 00:28:56.069
where every aspect

578
00:28:56.152 --> 00:28:59.739
of what we think
to be their private life

579
00:28:59.823 --> 00:29:03.368
has been built
by other people.

580
00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:11.042
(crowd cheering)

581
00:29:11.084 --> 00:29:13.753
Hudson:
I like to lean upon
a director.

582
00:29:13.837 --> 00:29:17.841
and if I can't lean on him.
I'm rather lost.

583
00:29:17.882 --> 00:29:19.968
And I am forced to rely
on myself.

584
00:29:20.051 --> 00:29:22.846
And that's not
a comfortable feeling.

585
00:29:22.887 --> 00:29:25.306

586
00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:32.230

588
00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.192
Hudson: Oh. well.
scrape me off the ceiling.

589
00:29:36.234 --> 00:29:38.403
I mean. the thrill
of a lifetime for me.

590
00:29:38.486 --> 00:29:40.613
But it was really
true what everybody said.

591
00:29:40.697 --> 00:29:43.575
make yourself a piece of putty
and put yourself in his hands

592
00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:45.201
and rely on him.

593
00:29:46.119 --> 00:29:49.414
Allison Anders:
George Stevens
is one of those classic

594
00:29:49.497 --> 00:29:51.249
American filmmakers.

595
00:29:51.332 --> 00:29:54.002
and no story I know is
as big as "Giant."

596
00:29:54.085 --> 00:29:56.171
It spans so many decades.

597
00:29:56.254 --> 00:29:59.299
It spans
so many sensibilities.

598
00:29:59.382 --> 00:30:04.971
Just the photography alone
is so magnificent.

599
00:30:05.055 --> 00:30:08.892
I've probably seen "Giant"
hundreds of times.

600
00:30:09.434 --> 00:30:11.436
I lost one friend
I had in this place

601
00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:13.104
and I know it too.

602
00:30:13.188 --> 00:30:15.315
So I quit. I'm dead quit.

603
00:30:15.398 --> 00:30:17.108
Don't have to say
another word to me.

604
00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:18.735
Nobody's firing you. Jett.

605
00:30:18.777 --> 00:30:21.446
Davis:
What kind of memories
do you have of James Dean?

606
00:30:21.488 --> 00:30:25.283
Hudson:
George used Jimmy because
Jimmy was new and hot.

607
00:30:25.367 --> 00:30:27.494
-Davis: Mm-hmm. Yes.
-Hudson: Hot-hot.

608
00:30:27.577 --> 00:30:30.747
I didn't particularly
like him. personally.

609
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:32.123
-Would you excuse me?
-Davis: Sure.

610
00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:33.958
Hudson: I'm wanna go
get a pack of cigarettes.

611
00:30:35.752 --> 00:30:36.961
(men clamoring)

612
00:30:37.003 --> 00:30:38.505
Griffin:
According to some accounts.

613
00:30:38.588 --> 00:30:42.342
James Dean was
rather disdainful of Hudson.

614
00:30:42.884 --> 00:30:45.053
Dean considered it
hypocritical

615
00:30:45.136 --> 00:30:48.640
that Rock was maintaining
this hetero facade in public

616
00:30:48.723 --> 00:30:51.059
while privately
hitting on Dean.

617
00:30:51.142 --> 00:30:53.019
if we're to believe
the rumor mill.

618
00:30:53.103 --> 00:30:56.690
Some might say that that's
a case of the pot calling
the kettle black.

619
00:30:56.773 --> 00:31:00.402
You know. it's pretty
well documented that
early in his career.

620
00:31:00.485 --> 00:31:04.030
James Dean was kept
by a gay radio executive

621
00:31:04.114 --> 00:31:07.575
who was indeed friends with
Rock's agent. Henry Willson.

622
00:31:07.659 --> 00:31:10.328
If you're talking
about shrouded sexuality.

623
00:31:10.412 --> 00:31:12.330
they weren't
all that different.

624
00:31:12.372 --> 00:31:14.416
Davis:
While we're talking
about James Dean.

625
00:31:14.499 --> 00:31:16.668
I don't know whether
you had anything else
you wanted to...

626
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:19.713
Hudson:
As I say. I didn't like
the fella too much.

627
00:31:19.796 --> 00:31:22.132
I don't know as
I should say any more.

628
00:31:22.173 --> 00:31:24.342
Uh. Jimmy was dead
before the picture was over.

629
00:31:24.384 --> 00:31:27.262
-Davis: Yes.
-Hudson: I don't like to talk
against anybody.

630
00:31:27.345 --> 00:31:29.305
And I don't like to talk
against the dead.

631
00:31:29.347 --> 00:31:31.516
-Davis: Mm-hmm.
-Hudson: So I think
I should shut up.

632
00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:33.351
-Davis: Yeah. all right. Okay.
-(Rock laughs)

633
00:31:33.435 --> 00:31:35.979
Hudson:
Where do you think you're
going with my automobile?

634
00:31:36.021 --> 00:31:37.856
-(engine stops)
-Just hold on.

635
00:31:37.939 --> 00:31:42.444
Griffin:
Hudson has definite negative
feelings about James Dean.

636
00:31:42.527 --> 00:31:45.363
but those feelings
are sharply contrasted

637
00:31:45.447 --> 00:31:49.659
with how much he loved
and cherished leading lady
Elizabeth Taylor.

638
00:31:49.701 --> 00:31:51.327
I'm a tough Texian.

639
00:31:51.369 --> 00:31:54.039
Anders:
It never ceases to amaze me
about Rock Hudson.

640
00:31:54.122 --> 00:31:56.041
how fully he gives himself

641
00:31:56.082 --> 00:31:58.793
to these heterosexual
romances.

642
00:31:58.877 --> 00:32:00.587
(cattle bellowing)

643
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:04.132
I mean. that scene when
they wake up on the train.

644
00:32:04.215 --> 00:32:07.218
they've been fucking
from Maryland
all the way. you know.

645
00:32:07.302 --> 00:32:10.513
to Texas. and I believe it!

646
00:32:11.181 --> 00:32:12.974
What's that? A wolf?

647
00:32:13.516 --> 00:32:17.729
No. honey. just
a little old coyote.

648
00:32:17.812 --> 00:32:19.522
(sighs)

649
00:32:19.564 --> 00:32:21.066
(contemplative music)

650
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:23.860
Griffin: It's no secret that
throughout her whole life.

651
00:32:23.902 --> 00:32:28.490
Elizabeth Taylor
had many close friendships
with gay men.

652
00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.410
Echoing her role in "Giant."
Taylor often gravitated

653
00:32:32.452 --> 00:32:35.872
toward social outcasts
or misfits.

654
00:32:35.914 --> 00:32:38.083
Hudson:
We became close friends.

655
00:32:38.124 --> 00:32:39.584
We are close friends today.

656
00:32:39.626 --> 00:32:42.045
and I think she is
one of the best people.

657
00:32:42.712 --> 00:32:45.382
Griffin: That kind
of loving bond between them.

658
00:32:45.423 --> 00:32:47.217
the soulmate connection.
if you will.

659
00:32:47.258 --> 00:32:50.595
becomes all the more important
later in life.

660
00:32:51.554 --> 00:32:55.558
Anders: George Stevens
had complicated characters

661
00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.146
and he cared about
those characters
within society

662
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.982
in a way that's different
from how Sirk did.

663
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.694
Now look here. Sarge.

664
00:33:05.777 --> 00:33:09.239
I'd sure appreciate it
if you were a little more
polite to these people.

665
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.199
Oh. you would. would you?

666
00:33:11.282 --> 00:33:12.951
Anders:
By the end of that movie.

667
00:33:13.034 --> 00:33:15.036
Rock Hudson
is our American hero

668
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.290
because he's inclusive
and he's a feminist.

669
00:33:19.332 --> 00:33:22.127
and then he's got grandkids
that are mixed.

670
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.879
Hudson: Those kids
in their infinite wisdom

671
00:33:24.963 --> 00:33:26.297
are smarter than we are.

672
00:33:26.381 --> 00:33:28.174
Anders:
That's America.
you know. to me.

673
00:33:28.258 --> 00:33:30.218
So he is America.

674
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.302
(lowing)

675
00:33:31.344 --> 00:33:33.805
Sure. even the calf's
got my number.

676
00:33:33.847 --> 00:33:35.640
(cool jazz music)

677
00:33:35.724 --> 00:33:38.435
Narrator:
In Hollywood. a new high
for glamor is reached

678
00:33:38.476 --> 00:33:42.564
as Warner Bros. premieres
George Stevens' production.
"Giant."

679
00:33:42.647 --> 00:33:44.649
Rock Hudson
and his charming wife Phyllis

680
00:33:44.733 --> 00:33:47.777
expressed their happiness
about the brilliant premiere.

681
00:33:47.819 --> 00:33:49.362
-Hey. Sugar!
-Yes?

682
00:33:49.446 --> 00:33:51.573
Here is a guy that's
as big as Texas in "Giant."

683
00:33:51.656 --> 00:33:53.950
-It's such a performance.
-Host: Rock Hudson.

684
00:33:53.992 --> 00:33:55.744
Hello. How are you?
Nice to see you again.

685
00:33:55.827 --> 00:33:58.496
-Nice to see you again.
-I wanna meet your wife. Hello.

686
00:33:58.538 --> 00:34:02.083
So nice to meet you. Phyllis.
You wanna step in here?

687
00:34:02.167 --> 00:34:03.960
I never heard such screams
in my life

688
00:34:04.002 --> 00:34:05.837
as when you
got outta the car tonight.

689
00:34:05.879 --> 00:34:07.422
Davis:
Well. you received

690
00:34:07.505 --> 00:34:09.382
an Academy Award nomination
for the film.

691
00:34:09.466 --> 00:34:11.009
Hudson:
Mm-hmm. so did Jimmy.

692
00:34:11.051 --> 00:34:12.969
Davis:
Is that right? I'd forgotten.

693
00:34:13.011 --> 00:34:15.554
The nominees
for best actor are:

694
00:34:15.638 --> 00:34:18.141
Yul Brynner in
"The King and I."

695
00:34:18.183 --> 00:34:20.310
Rock Hudson in "Giant."

696
00:34:20.351 --> 00:34:22.437
James Dean in "Giant."

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.688
Kirk Douglas
in "Lust for life."

698
00:34:24.731 --> 00:34:28.735
and Sir Laurence Olivier
in "Richard III."

699
00:34:28.818 --> 00:34:32.697
The winner is Yul Brynner.

700
00:34:34.866 --> 00:34:40.871
Anders:
Boy. it is really sad
to me that he lost

701
00:34:40.914 --> 00:34:45.043
because it's such
a tour de force performance.

702
00:34:45.627 --> 00:34:49.672
When do you get
that chance again?

703
00:34:49.714 --> 00:34:51.549
He did not.

704
00:34:52.842 --> 00:34:55.469
(contemplative music)

705
00:34:55.553 --> 00:34:58.056
Lee Garlington:
I wanted to be
a Western movie actor.

706
00:34:58.139 --> 00:35:03.311
So I landed
in Hollywood in 1961

707
00:35:03.395 --> 00:35:07.023
and realized
that I was kind of pretty.

708
00:35:07.065 --> 00:35:09.359
but. uh. what I didn't
realize was

709
00:35:09.401 --> 00:35:11.236
I didn't have any talent.

710
00:35:11.277 --> 00:35:15.365
Fortunately. when I
finally got with Rock.

711
00:35:15.407 --> 00:35:17.534
I realized I really
didn't want to be an actor.

712
00:35:17.575 --> 00:35:19.911
I didn't want any part
of that business.

713
00:35:19.953 --> 00:35:21.955
♪♪

714
00:35:22.038 --> 00:35:24.666
(Stephen Kijak speaking)

715
00:35:26.084 --> 00:35:27.377
(Garlington laughs)

716
00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:30.213
Uh. yes.
I remember very well.

717
00:35:30.255 --> 00:35:31.589
(Kijak chuckles)

718
00:35:31.631 --> 00:35:35.093
Garlington: I got a job
at Universal Studios.

719
00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:37.721
and I wanted to see
what he looked like.

720
00:35:37.762 --> 00:35:41.391
So I went over
beside his cottage.

721
00:35:41.433 --> 00:35:45.437
and he walked out
and walked down the street.

722
00:35:45.478 --> 00:35:48.023
and he turned
and looked back.

723
00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:50.525
And. of course. I was...
whew!

724
00:35:51.818 --> 00:35:53.611
He was incredible.

725
00:35:53.695 --> 00:35:58.158
He made a big splash.
let's put it that way.

726
00:35:58.783 --> 00:36:03.788
And I got a phone call
from someone on his staff.

727
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:07.834
Did I want to come up
and visit with Rock Hudson?

728
00:36:07.917 --> 00:36:09.544
And...

729
00:36:10.378 --> 00:36:13.256
I wasn't gonna say no.

730
00:36:13.298 --> 00:36:15.383
(cool jazz music)

731
00:36:19.429 --> 00:36:21.765
What is there
to talk about.
my dear husband?

732
00:36:21.806 --> 00:36:23.641
Judith. please.
You're in no condition...

733
00:36:23.683 --> 00:36:26.603
Divorce.
That's what you wanna
talk about. isn't it?

734
00:36:26.644 --> 00:36:28.646
Well. let me tell you
right now.

735
00:36:28.688 --> 00:36:31.983
my gallant. silent
suffering spouse.
you'll never get one!

736
00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:35.111
Our marriage was a mistake.
Yours as well as mine.

737
00:36:35.153 --> 00:36:38.740
Was it? You didn't think
so when you thought I could
make a gentleman out of you.

738
00:36:38.823 --> 00:36:42.786
Well. you married me
and you're going
to stay married to me.

739
00:36:42.827 --> 00:36:45.997
So sneak around
back alleys if that's
the kind of man you are.

740
00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:47.832
I doubt that I
could stop you.

741
00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:50.502
(somber music)

742
00:36:50.585 --> 00:36:52.462
Griffin:
When he was on location

743
00:36:52.504 --> 00:36:56.174
for the epic remake of
"A Farewell to Arms."

744
00:36:56.257 --> 00:36:59.511
Rock's marriage
to Phyllis began to fall apart.

745
00:37:02.681 --> 00:37:04.474
You're going down to town
tomorrow

746
00:37:04.516 --> 00:37:06.559
and find yourself
some gay young playmate.

747
00:37:06.643 --> 00:37:09.688
-I don't wanna be
with anybody else. I tell you.
-Yes. you do.

748
00:37:10.355 --> 00:37:12.357
Griffin:
Three years
after she exchanged

749
00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.192
marriage vows with Rock.

750
00:37:14.275 --> 00:37:16.528
Phyllis files for divorce.

751
00:37:16.569 --> 00:37:18.655
Phyllis complained
that he was always away.

752
00:37:18.697 --> 00:37:20.865
Well. hello.
You're married to
a major movie star

753
00:37:20.949 --> 00:37:24.119
who's shooting films
in exotic locations.

754
00:37:24.202 --> 00:37:27.539
Garlington: She really
took him to the cleaners
when she divorced him.

755
00:37:27.622 --> 00:37:29.374
He lost
practically everything.

756
00:37:29.416 --> 00:37:32.544
He had a sailboat
that was his pride and joy.

757
00:37:32.585 --> 00:37:34.879
and he had to sell that
to pay her off.

758
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:37.632
And. uh. he was really
angry about that.

759
00:37:37.716 --> 00:37:41.386
Griffin:
In a memoir published
two years after Rock's death.

760
00:37:41.469 --> 00:37:43.221
Phyllis claimed that

761
00:37:43.304 --> 00:37:45.223
she was
entirely duped.

762
00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:47.350
manipulated
into participating

763
00:37:47.392 --> 00:37:49.436
in this sham marriage
with Rock.

764
00:37:49.519 --> 00:37:53.481
And she claims
she had no idea
that Hudson is gay.

765
00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:56.067
which is
really hard to swallow.

766
00:37:56.109 --> 00:38:00.071
given the fact that virtually
every bit player. makeup man.

767
00:38:00.113 --> 00:38:02.198
assistant gofer at Universal.

768
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.368
knew the score
about Rock Hudson.

769
00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:07.704
How did she possibly
miss the memo?

770
00:38:07.746 --> 00:38:10.915
It's just kind of
inconceivable.

771
00:38:10.999 --> 00:38:13.418
(mellow jazz music)

772
00:38:13.501 --> 00:38:16.379
(telephone ringing)

773
00:38:22.218 --> 00:38:23.595
Colonel Farr.

774
00:38:23.636 --> 00:38:25.513
I thought we could
get together.

775
00:38:25.597 --> 00:38:27.515
have a cup
of coffee. maybe.

776
00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:29.184
uh. get acquainted.

777
00:38:29.267 --> 00:38:31.978
We might find we have
a lot in common.

778
00:38:32.062 --> 00:38:33.438
I'm on my way.

779
00:38:37.525 --> 00:38:40.028
Doris Day:
♪ Pillow talk ♪

780
00:38:40.111 --> 00:38:41.821
♪ Pillow talk ♪

781
00:38:41.905 --> 00:38:44.199
♪ Another night
I hear myself ♪

782
00:38:44.282 --> 00:38:45.533
♪ Talk. talk. talk. talk ♪

783
00:38:45.617 --> 00:38:47.702
Look. I don't know
what's bothering you.

784
00:38:47.786 --> 00:38:50.121
but don't take
your bedroom problems
out on me.

785
00:38:50.163 --> 00:38:51.664
I have no bedroom problems.

786
00:38:51.748 --> 00:38:54.125
There's nothing
in my bedroom
that bothers me.

787
00:38:54.167 --> 00:38:56.252
Oh. that's too bad.

788
00:38:56.294 --> 00:38:57.879
"Pillow Talk"
seems very tame now

789
00:38:57.962 --> 00:39:02.467
by comparison with.
um. today's more
explicit standards.

790
00:39:02.509 --> 00:39:05.887
We almost didn't do it
because it was too dirty.

791
00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:09.140
(cool jazz music)

792
00:39:09.182 --> 00:39:12.477
Hudson:
So that's the other end
of your party line.

793
00:39:12.936 --> 00:39:15.814
Hunter:
It was fun and. and.
and it was fluff.

794
00:39:15.897 --> 00:39:19.275
and it was wonderful
to look at. and you laughed.

795
00:39:19.317 --> 00:39:21.444
I'm so sick of seeing
the ugliness.

796
00:39:21.486 --> 00:39:22.862
We all know it's there.

797
00:39:22.946 --> 00:39:24.447
I don't hide my head
in the sand

798
00:39:24.489 --> 00:39:25.949
and say that it's not there.

799
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:29.452
But I believe that motion
pictures are an escape.

800
00:39:29.494 --> 00:39:32.330
(couple laughing)

801
00:39:32.414 --> 00:39:35.000
Day:
What a marvelous-looking man.

802
00:39:35.083 --> 00:39:37.794
I wonder if he's single.

803
00:39:39.421 --> 00:39:43.174
Hudson:
I don't know how long I can
get away with this act.

804
00:39:44.884 --> 00:39:45.885
(chuckles)

805
00:39:45.969 --> 00:39:48.471
Tom Santopietro:
You know. the deception

806
00:39:48.513 --> 00:39:51.474
is an interesting artifact
of the times.

807
00:39:51.516 --> 00:39:55.854
You have a gay actor
playing a straight man

808
00:39:55.895 --> 00:39:58.481
impersonating
a possibly gay man.

809
00:39:58.523 --> 00:39:59.649
It's a house of mirrors.

810
00:39:59.691 --> 00:40:01.860
Tell me about your job.

811
00:40:01.901 --> 00:40:04.362
Must be very exciting
working with

812
00:40:04.404 --> 00:40:07.365
all them colors
and fabrics and all.

813
00:40:07.449 --> 00:40:09.534
(cool jazz continues)

814
00:40:09.617 --> 00:40:11.619
Maupin:
In those Doris Day movies.

815
00:40:11.703 --> 00:40:13.705
he's always
pretending to be gay

816
00:40:13.788 --> 00:40:16.207
in order to get Doris
into bed.

817
00:40:16.249 --> 00:40:18.460
That's the joke always.

818
00:40:18.543 --> 00:40:20.920
Why can't you get married?

819
00:40:21.755 --> 00:40:23.214
That's the sort
of thing a man

820
00:40:23.256 --> 00:40:25.467
doesn't discuss
with a nice woman.

821
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.093
Maupin:
That was almost a device

822
00:40:27.177 --> 00:40:29.220
to keep anybody from asking
questions about him.

823
00:40:29.304 --> 00:40:31.514
Ye gods.
you've got cold feet!

824
00:40:31.556 --> 00:40:33.767
Complaints.
complaints. nothing
but complaints!

825
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.019
Maupin: It was kind of
an evil gag. actually.

826
00:40:36.061 --> 00:40:39.814
And I hold Ross Hunter
largely responsible for that.

827
00:40:39.898 --> 00:40:41.399
the producer of those films.

828
00:40:41.483 --> 00:40:44.069
I know for a fact
that Ross Hunter was gay.

829
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:46.654
(dramatic jazz music)

830
00:40:46.696 --> 00:40:48.323
Linus!

831
00:40:48.406 --> 00:40:50.575
What are you doing here?

832
00:40:51.076 --> 00:40:53.578
Where am I?

833
00:40:54.662 --> 00:40:57.707
Why. this is
Jerry Webster's apartment!

834
00:40:57.749 --> 00:41:00.251
Day:
Nothing was ever talked about

835
00:41:00.335 --> 00:41:02.087
as far as his private life.

836
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.546
(groans)

837
00:41:03.588 --> 00:41:06.466
Day:
Many. many people
would ask me.

838
00:41:06.549 --> 00:41:08.927
you know.
"Is Rock Hudson really gay?"

839
00:41:08.968 --> 00:41:13.556
And I said. "It's something
that I will not discuss."

840
00:41:13.598 --> 00:41:17.811
I mean. first of all.
I know nothing
about his private life.

841
00:41:17.894 --> 00:41:20.021
And if I did.
I wouldn't discuss it.

842
00:41:20.105 --> 00:41:21.231
Look at me.

843
00:41:21.272 --> 00:41:24.984
I can't.
I'm too ashamed.

844
00:41:25.068 --> 00:41:26.653
Forget me. Carol.

845
00:41:26.736 --> 00:41:30.699
You deserve a man.
not a mass
of neurotic doubts.

846
00:41:31.324 --> 00:41:35.328
Day: So I can't tell you
one thing about him except
that he is a nice man.

847
00:41:35.787 --> 00:41:37.580
You're tearing
yourself apart!

848
00:41:37.622 --> 00:41:39.040
Mr. Allen.

849
00:41:39.124 --> 00:41:42.127
Let's try to be adult
about this and work out

850
00:41:42.168 --> 00:41:43.878
some sort of schedule
where I can...

851
00:41:43.962 --> 00:41:46.172
Jillson:
It's funny when I see him

852
00:41:46.256 --> 00:41:47.507
smoking in that movie.

853
00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.801
it was so him.
because he chain smoked.

854
00:41:49.843 --> 00:41:52.470
It's like he's
not even acting.

855
00:41:52.512 --> 00:41:55.724
(perky jazz music)

856
00:41:55.807 --> 00:41:57.475
Jillson:
Mark and George were

857
00:41:57.559 --> 00:41:59.310
really good friends with me

858
00:41:59.394 --> 00:42:01.104
and my partner. Al Roberts.

859
00:42:01.146 --> 00:42:02.605
and that's how I met Rock.

860
00:42:02.647 --> 00:42:05.191
And we. we just really

861
00:42:05.275 --> 00:42:06.735
hit it off because

862
00:42:06.818 --> 00:42:09.195
I didn't treat him like
a movie star.

863
00:42:09.279 --> 00:42:11.906
I-- We were just cool friends.

864
00:42:12.824 --> 00:42:15.660
Our social life with him
was very private.

865
00:42:15.744 --> 00:42:18.663
I mean. we didn't
go out to restaurants.

866
00:42:18.705 --> 00:42:20.832
We would go to Rock's house.

867
00:42:20.915 --> 00:42:23.418
It was called "The Castle."

868
00:42:23.501 --> 00:42:24.753
It was breathtaking.

869
00:42:24.836 --> 00:42:27.297
It looked like a hacienda.

870
00:42:27.339 --> 00:42:31.634
You just felt so welcome
when you came to that home.

871
00:42:31.676 --> 00:42:34.721
The house was very casual.

872
00:42:34.804 --> 00:42:38.308
It wasn't stiff.
And that's how he was.

873
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.352
He was very. very casual.

874
00:42:40.435 --> 00:42:44.356
And then. of course.
when he'd come to Laguna.
it was really. really fun too.

875
00:42:45.106 --> 00:42:48.526
I think he could breathe
a lot easier in Laguna.

876
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:53.365
And because Mark
and George had a home here.
he did come down a lot.

877
00:42:54.157 --> 00:42:58.078
The gay beach
was to the left
of the lifeguard tower.

878
00:42:58.161 --> 00:43:02.791
And it was magical
because you could play
volleyball on the beach

879
00:43:02.874 --> 00:43:04.417
and just without a shirt on.

880
00:43:04.501 --> 00:43:06.169
just step up into the bar

881
00:43:06.211 --> 00:43:08.213
on a hot summer Sunday

882
00:43:08.254 --> 00:43:09.714
and have a beer.

883
00:43:09.756 --> 00:43:12.717
and it was very erotic.

884
00:43:12.801 --> 00:43:15.512
Yeah. I mean. like big time.

885
00:43:15.553 --> 00:43:16.638
Yeah.

886
00:43:16.721 --> 00:43:20.100
(relaxing jazz music)

887
00:43:20.183 --> 00:43:21.685
Do you love me.
Mitch?

888
00:43:21.726 --> 00:43:23.269
Like a brother.

889
00:43:25.563 --> 00:43:27.440
I don't want you
as a brother.

890
00:43:27.524 --> 00:43:29.901
Can't be any other way.
Marylee.

891
00:43:32.404 --> 00:43:34.948
Don't... please don't...

892
00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:38.410
waste your life away
waiting for me.

893
00:43:42.872 --> 00:43:45.125
Griffin: You have
the movie magazines

894
00:43:45.208 --> 00:43:46.751
propping up this fantasy

895
00:43:46.793 --> 00:43:49.963
that everyone is straight
and looking for love
and marriage.

896
00:43:50.046 --> 00:43:53.717
while the tabloids
are obsessed
with homosexuals

897
00:43:53.758 --> 00:43:57.303
and trying to dig up
as much dirt as they can.

898
00:43:57.387 --> 00:44:00.640
This. of course. was during
the era of J. Edgar Hoover.

899
00:44:00.724 --> 00:44:04.602
So there's
an obsessive interest
in anything homosexual.

900
00:44:04.644 --> 00:44:06.604
Policy of the department is

901
00:44:06.688 --> 00:44:09.149
that we do not employ
homosexuals knowingly.

902
00:44:09.232 --> 00:44:12.736
And that if we discover
homosexuals in our department.
we discharge them.

903
00:44:13.903 --> 00:44:17.490
Griffin: Given all that was
going on in Rock Hudson's
private life.

904
00:44:17.574 --> 00:44:22.370
it's not surprising
that the FBI was keeping
a close watch.

905
00:44:22.454 --> 00:44:25.623
The lieutenant wants
to ask you some questions.

906
00:44:26.458 --> 00:44:29.085
Like where you've
been spending
your evenings lately.

907
00:44:29.127 --> 00:44:31.171
staying out till three
and four in the morning.

908
00:44:33.631 --> 00:44:35.133
Griffin:
There was this catchphrase

909
00:44:35.216 --> 00:44:36.843
about "Confidential"
magazine:

910
00:44:36.926 --> 00:44:40.722
"They trade in nymphos.
pinkos. winos and homos."

911
00:44:40.805 --> 00:44:42.599
And it's got
a subscription base

912
00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.351
of three million
at that point.

913
00:44:44.434 --> 00:44:46.227
It's got a huge readership.

914
00:44:46.311 --> 00:44:50.732
"Confidential" started
to move in on Rock Hudson

915
00:44:50.815 --> 00:44:53.818
and Henry Willson certainly
did not wanna lose

916
00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.111
this golden goose.

917
00:44:55.153 --> 00:44:57.238
They say that there
was this tradeoff

918
00:44:57.322 --> 00:44:59.032
where Tab Hunter.
who was indeed

919
00:44:59.115 --> 00:45:01.493
a Henry Willson client.
was offered up

920
00:45:01.534 --> 00:45:02.869
sacrificially

921
00:45:02.952 --> 00:45:04.829
to save Rock Hudson.

922
00:45:04.913 --> 00:45:07.123
"Confidential"
printed a story

923
00:45:07.165 --> 00:45:08.833
about Tab Hunter
being arrested

924
00:45:08.875 --> 00:45:12.128
at what was called
an "all-male pajama party."

925
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:14.214
That kind of salacious exposé

926
00:45:14.297 --> 00:45:17.092
could wipe out
an entire career.

927
00:45:17.884 --> 00:45:19.678
We being followed?

928
00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:20.970
Probably not.

929
00:45:21.012 --> 00:45:23.348
but the general always
goes on that assumption.

930
00:45:24.057 --> 00:45:27.102
Griffin:
It really is a miracle
that Rock Hudson

931
00:45:27.185 --> 00:45:30.480
never got
caught by the tabloids.

932
00:45:33.566 --> 00:45:35.610
Well. you know.
I never met Rock.

933
00:45:35.694 --> 00:45:37.987
Uh. he died in October of '85.

934
00:45:38.029 --> 00:45:41.241
and I came into Lee's life
in May of '86.

935
00:45:41.324 --> 00:45:45.120
Lee Garlington:
Rock took that photo
in the early '70s.

936
00:45:45.203 --> 00:45:47.956
That's completely
in a different era.

937
00:45:48.039 --> 00:45:51.876
We enjoyed
traveling together.

938
00:45:51.918 --> 00:45:55.380
(Latin jazz music)

939
00:45:55.463 --> 00:45:59.426
He drove the management
at Universal crazy

940
00:45:59.509 --> 00:46:02.429
by taking off. he and I.

941
00:46:02.512 --> 00:46:05.557
without telling them
where he was going.

942
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.184
And they really got upset.

943
00:46:08.226 --> 00:46:11.855
and he just said.
"Screw it. I'm gonna do
what I'm gonna do."

944
00:46:11.896 --> 00:46:15.400
(Latin jazz continues)

945
00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:24.075
We spent some time
in New Orleans

946
00:46:24.159 --> 00:46:27.037
and the Ford Motor Company
lent him

947
00:46:27.078 --> 00:46:29.956
a brand-new convertible.

948
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.417
And we had a blast in that car.

949
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.128
♪♪

950
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:40.008
We were in Pat O'Brien's

951
00:46:40.091 --> 00:46:43.303
where they have a special
drink. the Hurricane.

952
00:46:43.386 --> 00:46:48.099
and somebody came by
and snapped a picture of us.

953
00:46:49.601 --> 00:46:52.771
Then they offered the picture
for sale. of course.

954
00:46:52.812 --> 00:46:59.819
and we got it because
this was the only picture
of both of us together.

955
00:46:59.903 --> 00:47:02.322
We were ordered
by Henry Willson.

956
00:47:02.405 --> 00:47:04.783
that evil agent of his.

957
00:47:04.824 --> 00:47:07.952
never to have our picture
taken together

958
00:47:08.036 --> 00:47:10.622
because somebody would see it

959
00:47:10.663 --> 00:47:14.334
and know that we were gay.

960
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:18.046
(Kijak speaking)

961
00:47:24.135 --> 00:47:26.471
Yes. that was a lot
of sneaking around.

962
00:47:26.513 --> 00:47:28.306
We'd drive up to a motel.

963
00:47:28.348 --> 00:47:31.017
I would go in and ask
if there was any rooms.

964
00:47:31.101 --> 00:47:34.229
Paul Garlington:
Did you get. let's say.
two single beds

965
00:47:34.312 --> 00:47:37.649
or one... queen-size bed.
pardon the pun?

966
00:47:37.691 --> 00:47:39.234
Or...

967
00:47:39.317 --> 00:47:40.944
Don't remember.

968
00:47:40.985 --> 00:47:42.737
Uh. but. uh...

969
00:47:42.821 --> 00:47:46.074
it ended up
by being one bed.

970
00:47:47.534 --> 00:47:49.035
(Kijak speaking)

971
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:03.216
There should have been.
but there wasn't.

972
00:48:03.299 --> 00:48:07.137
There was a part of him
that was very straitlaced

973
00:48:07.178 --> 00:48:11.182
and understanding
of the previous generation.

974
00:48:11.266 --> 00:48:13.852
He never mentioned.
"Gee. wouldn't it be nice

975
00:48:13.935 --> 00:48:16.980
if we could just
hold hands in public?"

976
00:48:17.022 --> 00:48:21.776
He was so inured of. uh...

977
00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.987
being closeted

978
00:48:24.029 --> 00:48:26.698
that he never mentioned it.

979
00:48:29.576 --> 00:48:31.870
Forget for a moment
that I'm your doctor

980
00:48:31.911 --> 00:48:34.789
and. uh. let me give you
some advice as a friend.

981
00:48:34.873 --> 00:48:36.666
Marry him.

982
00:48:37.208 --> 00:48:40.545
So. what good was
your noble sacrifice?

983
00:48:40.587 --> 00:48:43.381
If you'd loved him.
you'd have gone to him.

984
00:48:43.465 --> 00:48:46.676
Let's face it. you were
ready for a love affair.

985
00:48:46.718 --> 00:48:48.553
but not for love.

986
00:48:48.636 --> 00:48:50.597
(romantic piano music)

987
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.861
Oh. my darling!
Oh. my darling.

988
00:49:04.903 --> 00:49:06.488
Are you having
another nightmare?

989
00:49:06.571 --> 00:49:07.822
Uh. no. I. I...

990
00:49:07.906 --> 00:49:09.449
Hudson:
I'm sort of. I don't know.

991
00:49:09.532 --> 00:49:12.243
We have to talk about
that thing called image. uh.

992
00:49:12.285 --> 00:49:14.204
whatever that is. uh...

993
00:49:14.245 --> 00:49:15.830
and I sort of represent

994
00:49:15.914 --> 00:49:17.499
a comedy image

995
00:49:17.582 --> 00:49:20.085
in dinner jacket or something.
you know?

996
00:49:20.126 --> 00:49:21.920
It might be a lot of fun
to do a horror story.

997
00:49:22.003 --> 00:49:23.505
I'd love to.

998
00:49:23.588 --> 00:49:25.048
(eerie organ music)

999
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:27.133
Narrator:
Bold.

1000
00:49:27.759 --> 00:49:30.053
Bizarre.

1001
00:49:31.137 --> 00:49:33.473
Terrifying.

1002
00:49:35.308 --> 00:49:38.603
Rock Hudson. in
an astonishing change of pace.

1003
00:49:38.645 --> 00:49:41.564
stars in "Seconds."

1004
00:49:42.315 --> 00:49:46.277
Hudson: It's certainly. uh.
a different type of picture

1005
00:49:46.319 --> 00:49:49.656
and certainly
a different role for me.

1006
00:49:49.739 --> 00:49:52.033
It's almost a horror movie.

1007
00:49:52.117 --> 00:49:54.202
certainly a suspenseful movie.

1008
00:49:54.285 --> 00:49:56.579
and certainly very dramatic.

1009
00:49:56.621 --> 00:50:01.084
Narrator: Rock Hudson as
a man who buys for himself
a totally new life.

1010
00:50:01.126 --> 00:50:03.336
a chance to begin again.

1011
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:07.090
Every man's dream
since time began.

1012
00:50:07.132 --> 00:50:09.467
Doctor:
Bandages are removed.

1013
00:50:09.509 --> 00:50:12.095
I think you'll be
more than pleased.

1014
00:50:12.137 --> 00:50:17.017
In fact.
I expect you to be prancing
around here like a stud bull.

1015
00:50:18.476 --> 00:50:19.894
Good work.

1016
00:50:19.978 --> 00:50:22.564
Griffin: Well. I tend to think
that Rock Hudson understood

1017
00:50:22.647 --> 00:50:27.152
that in some ways this film
was reflecting the whole
Hollywood star trip

1018
00:50:27.235 --> 00:50:29.320
and how he had been
completely transformed

1019
00:50:29.404 --> 00:50:31.489
and marketed for the public.

1020
00:50:31.573 --> 00:50:34.200
Uh. that couldn't
have been lost on him.

1021
00:50:34.284 --> 00:50:38.496
Anders: There's never a time
that I don't feel at home

1022
00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:43.668
in a performance by Rock Hudson
except "Seconds." (laughs)

1023
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:45.337
Doctor:
All right. son.

1024
00:50:45.378 --> 00:50:47.505
Anders:
He's so uncomfortable.

1025
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:52.344
There is a real shadow side
here that he's playing.

1026
00:50:52.969 --> 00:50:54.637
(inhales sharply)

1027
00:50:54.679 --> 00:50:56.681
The years I've spent

1028
00:50:56.765 --> 00:50:58.683
trying to get all the things

1029
00:50:58.725 --> 00:51:01.895
I was told were important.

1030
00:51:01.978 --> 00:51:05.940
that I was supposed to want...

1031
00:51:06.024 --> 00:51:09.027
and California was the same.

1032
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:10.403
They...

1033
00:51:10.487 --> 00:51:12.697
made the same decisions for me

1034
00:51:12.781 --> 00:51:13.948
all over again.

1035
00:51:14.032 --> 00:51:16.826
And they were
the same things. really.

1036
00:51:18.161 --> 00:51:21.956
Hey. John. why are they
staring at me like that?

1037
00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.500
They know.

1038
00:51:23.541 --> 00:51:27.337
Hudson: (laughing. slurring)
They know what?

1039
00:51:27.379 --> 00:51:30.006
John:
They're like you.

1040
00:51:30.048 --> 00:51:32.717
(screaming) Oh. Nora!

1041
00:51:33.343 --> 00:51:35.804
Douglas: Hudson's performance
is astonishing.

1042
00:51:35.887 --> 00:51:40.016
Is Rock Hudson kind of
decoding himself on screen?

1043
00:51:40.058 --> 00:51:42.185
Yeah. it certainly
looks like it.

1044
00:51:42.227 --> 00:51:46.564
Anders:
It's a weird thing
to make your living

1045
00:51:46.648 --> 00:51:48.400
creating characters.

1046
00:51:48.441 --> 00:51:51.736
It's weird from my side
of the camera

1047
00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.823
and it must be even weirder
on the other side

1048
00:51:54.906 --> 00:51:57.909
because I think there is
always a sense of like.

1049
00:51:57.992 --> 00:51:59.911
"Who am I really?" You know?

1050
00:51:59.953 --> 00:52:01.621
(rain falling)

1051
00:52:01.705 --> 00:52:03.915
Somewhere in the man.

1052
00:52:03.957 --> 00:52:07.460
there is still a key
unturned.

1053
00:52:08.044 --> 00:52:10.630
Griffin:
In order to become Rock Hudson.

1054
00:52:10.714 --> 00:52:15.301
he really had to destroy
Roy Fitzgerald.

1055
00:52:15.385 --> 00:52:19.764
the gay boy with
an inferiority complex
from Winnetka.

1056
00:52:19.806 --> 00:52:23.768
But even if millions of fans
are believing the lie.

1057
00:52:23.852 --> 00:52:28.606
Roy Fitzgerald still knows
the truth about Rock Hudson.

1058
00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:32.610
Wait a minute.
what's happening?

1059
00:52:32.652 --> 00:52:36.448
Douglas:
When "Seconds" first
came out. it was trashed.

1060
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:39.993
Nobody wanted to see
Rock Hudson depressed.
(laughs)

1061
00:52:40.076 --> 00:52:42.287
Griffin:
What's really sad to me
about Rock's career

1062
00:52:42.328 --> 00:52:43.580
is that the audiences

1063
00:52:43.621 --> 00:52:46.249
don't like it when
Rock Hudson steps out of.

1064
00:52:46.291 --> 00:52:48.918
kind of. the way
that they prefer to see him.

1065
00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.756
They don't want to see him do
anything radically different.

1066
00:52:52.797 --> 00:52:55.675
(Rock screaming)

1067
00:52:56.301 --> 00:52:58.970
(somber music)

1068
00:52:59.012 --> 00:53:00.638
Hudson:
Being an actor.

1069
00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:03.975
there are so many
disappointments
and frustrations.

1070
00:53:04.059 --> 00:53:06.895
and you think. "Hell.
what am I doing all this for?

1071
00:53:06.978 --> 00:53:09.314
I'm gonna hop the next freight
out of town." or whatever.

1072
00:53:09.356 --> 00:53:12.150
You get blue
and you get whatever.

1073
00:53:12.233 --> 00:53:14.194
And I think that
because of that.

1074
00:53:14.277 --> 00:53:17.447
I think "this too shall pass"
works for me.

1075
00:53:18.073 --> 00:53:21.618
Host:
"This too shall pass"
is a great consolation.

1076
00:53:21.659 --> 00:53:25.997
I mean. in terms of what.
crises or adverse reviews
or anything?

1077
00:53:26.081 --> 00:53:29.459
Yes. anything negative.
Any. you know...

1078
00:53:30.877 --> 00:53:33.088
(upbeat jazz music)

1079
00:53:33.171 --> 00:53:35.507
Joe Carberry:
I was born in Iowa.

1080
00:53:35.548 --> 00:53:38.677
and then I came to
Los Angeles and never left.

1081
00:53:38.718 --> 00:53:39.969
Why?

1082
00:53:40.011 --> 00:53:42.555
Well. I went
to my first gay bar.

1083
00:53:42.639 --> 00:53:46.393
It was in. uh.
Long Beach at a drag bar.

1084
00:53:46.476 --> 00:53:49.145
I didn't particularly like
the drag queens.

1085
00:53:49.187 --> 00:53:53.900
but I sure liked the fact
that there was somebody
in this world

1086
00:53:53.983 --> 00:53:55.360
that was gay besides me .

1087
00:53:55.402 --> 00:53:57.362
(jazz music continues)

1088
00:53:57.445 --> 00:54:00.198
Kijak:
How did you meet Rock Hudson?

1089
00:54:00.281 --> 00:54:01.908
Carberry:
I don't know
what year it was.

1090
00:54:01.991 --> 00:54:06.204
but one of my best friends
brought him over for dinner.

1091
00:54:06.246 --> 00:54:09.582
We played bridge
all the time.

1092
00:54:09.666 --> 00:54:12.711
We. uh. did a lot
of things together.

1093
00:54:12.794 --> 00:54:16.798
I took trips with him
and we went skiing.

1094
00:54:16.881 --> 00:54:21.219
I watched "Giant" more times
than I care to remember.

1095
00:54:21.261 --> 00:54:22.554
(Turner chuckles)

1096
00:54:22.637 --> 00:54:26.349
Those were good times
that can't be repeated.

1097
00:54:26.391 --> 00:54:29.561
I felt closer to him
than anybody else.

1098
00:54:29.644 --> 00:54:31.563
If you say.
"Who's your closest friend?"

1099
00:54:31.646 --> 00:54:34.941
I mean. his name
would come out first.
I think.

1100
00:54:35.567 --> 00:54:37.902
Tab Hunter was
a good friend of mine.

1101
00:54:37.944 --> 00:54:39.487
but he wasn't very social.

1102
00:54:39.571 --> 00:54:41.573
He didn't like a crowd.

1103
00:54:41.614 --> 00:54:43.908
but it didn't bother Rock.

1104
00:54:44.576 --> 00:54:47.287
At that time.
nobody lived openly.

1105
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:49.205
He wanted to.

1106
00:54:49.247 --> 00:54:52.417
I ran a hospital laboratory.
you know.

1107
00:54:52.459 --> 00:54:55.545
I can walk into any place
and nobody knows who I am.

1108
00:54:55.587 --> 00:54:58.423
but he couldn't do
any of that.

1109
00:54:58.506 --> 00:55:00.800
Yeah.
That bothered him.

1110
00:55:00.884 --> 00:55:02.594
(Kijak speaking)

1111
00:55:04.929 --> 00:55:06.264
Well. he had boyfriends.

1112
00:55:06.348 --> 00:55:10.185
They were mostly young
and pretty.

1113
00:55:10.268 --> 00:55:13.938
and showed huge baskets.

1114
00:55:14.773 --> 00:55:18.401
I don't recall him
ever having a very
long relationship

1115
00:55:18.443 --> 00:55:20.779
with anybody.

1116
00:55:20.862 --> 00:55:22.989
other than friends.

1117
00:55:24.032 --> 00:55:25.617
(Kijak speaking)

1118
00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.119
-Yeah.
-Kijak: Oh. okay.

1119
00:55:28.203 --> 00:55:32.290
Rock had a sizable dick.

1120
00:55:32.374 --> 00:55:35.126
but he tried to put
that thing up my ass

1121
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:37.212
and I couldn't do it.
(laughs)

1122
00:55:37.295 --> 00:55:40.674
(mellow jazz music)

1123
00:55:40.757 --> 00:55:42.842
For a while. you had
the whole field to yourself.

1124
00:55:42.926 --> 00:55:44.886
-For a while you were the...
-I did?

1125
00:55:44.969 --> 00:55:46.137
-Oh. yes.
-Did I?

1126
00:55:46.221 --> 00:55:48.014
Oh. yes. yes.
Am I right?

1127
00:55:48.098 --> 00:55:50.642
There was only. you know.
Rock Hudson. pant-pant...

1128
00:55:50.725 --> 00:55:52.811
-(audience applauding)
-And a lot of "ugs."

1129
00:55:52.894 --> 00:55:55.689
You know. the Pacinos
and the strangies were
coming up. and then...

1130
00:55:55.772 --> 00:55:58.108
-(laughter)
-Well. you know
what I'm saying.

1131
00:55:58.149 --> 00:56:01.569
You don't say my. you know.
"I wanna be on a desert
island with Al Pacino."

1132
00:56:01.653 --> 00:56:03.822
you know. we'll talk.
but. um...

1133
00:56:03.863 --> 00:56:06.991
Does it ever upset you
when you're in something
like the "Enquirer"?

1134
00:56:07.075 --> 00:56:08.493
Uh. no.
I don't read it. so...

1135
00:56:08.535 --> 00:56:10.328
I read it all the time.
You're always in it.

1136
00:56:10.412 --> 00:56:12.247
-Am I?
-Yeah.

1137
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:13.998
First. I had asked him
whether the press

1138
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.085
had ever really hurt him.
and it was interesting.

1139
00:56:17.168 --> 00:56:19.796
He said. "Yes. it was a terrible
review I received in London."

1140
00:56:19.838 --> 00:56:22.257
I said. "You mean
that was the worst thing

1141
00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:24.843
that the press has
ever done to you. Rock?"

1142
00:56:24.926 --> 00:56:26.845
And he said. "Yes."
and I remember

1143
00:56:26.928 --> 00:56:30.473
it was very difficult for me
to face. look into his eyes.

1144
00:56:30.515 --> 00:56:34.602
And I said.
"Could you explain to us

1145
00:56:34.686 --> 00:56:38.690
what happened between you
and Mr. Jim Nabors?"

1146
00:56:39.524 --> 00:56:42.235
Griffin:
In 1971.

1147
00:56:42.318 --> 00:56:43.820
a couple of gay guys said.

1148
00:56:43.862 --> 00:56:48.366
"Wouldn't it be fun if
we sent out these invitations

1149
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:50.535
"to a fabricated wedding

1150
00:56:50.577 --> 00:56:54.789
between Rock
and 'Gomer Pyle'
star Jim Nabors?"

1151
00:56:54.873 --> 00:56:59.002
And the tipoff that this
is like an over-the-top
gay Fantasia

1152
00:56:59.044 --> 00:57:02.547
is that Truman Capote
would be officiating

1153
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:04.674
and Liberace
would be providing

1154
00:57:04.716 --> 00:57:06.760
the musical accompaniment.

1155
00:57:06.843 --> 00:57:09.929
And the story starts
to spread like wildfire.

1156
00:57:10.013 --> 00:57:12.807
The story
lands on the front page

1157
00:57:12.891 --> 00:57:14.893
of the "National Examiner."

1158
00:57:14.976 --> 00:57:16.561
Now I've read some pretty
weird things about you

1159
00:57:16.644 --> 00:57:18.563
in the fan magazines.

1160
00:57:18.646 --> 00:57:21.441
Uh. have you ever filed
a libel suit for anything

1161
00:57:21.524 --> 00:57:24.861
that's ever been written
or said about you?
Have you wanted to?

1162
00:57:25.945 --> 00:57:28.073
And why didn't you?
I've always wondered.

1163
00:57:28.114 --> 00:57:30.825
Because it calls
attention to it
and only makes it worse.

1164
00:57:30.909 --> 00:57:34.496
Aside from the McCarthy era
nonsense that went on
in the '50s.

1165
00:57:34.579 --> 00:57:37.457
I think that this was
one of the worst stories

1166
00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.793
that ever emanated
from a community.

1167
00:57:39.876 --> 00:57:42.921
He has never done
a bad thing to anyone.

1168
00:57:42.962 --> 00:57:45.590
It would be terrific
to say the guy is

1169
00:57:45.674 --> 00:57:47.926
"you know what."
but he is not.

1170
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.846
Griffin:
What's funny is tabloids
aren't leaking a story

1171
00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:55.100
about one of Rock's
real gay relationships.

1172
00:57:55.141 --> 00:57:58.561
They're leaking it
about a completely fabricated

1173
00:57:58.603 --> 00:58:01.398
and fantasized one.

1174
00:58:01.439 --> 00:58:04.526
-(line ringing)
-Friend: March 1st. 1974.

1175
00:58:04.609 --> 00:58:06.945
-Rock. how are you?
-Hudson: I'm fine.

1176
00:58:06.986 --> 00:58:08.863
Friend: Haven't talked to you
in a very long time.

1177
00:58:08.947 --> 00:58:10.615
Hudson:
I know it. I know it.

1178
00:58:10.657 --> 00:58:12.659
-Friend: And you've been busy.
-Hudson: Yeah.

1179
00:58:12.742 --> 00:58:16.329
Friend: My friend would like
very much to meet you
one of these days

1180
00:58:16.413 --> 00:58:17.664
if you have some free time.

1181
00:58:17.747 --> 00:58:19.207
Hudson:
Tell me about him.

1182
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:21.876
Friend :
He works at Paramount
and he's. uh...

1183
00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.088
-oh. 6'2". I guess.
something like that.
-Hudson: Yeah.

1184
00:58:25.171 --> 00:58:28.258
Friend : And he works out.
just an all-round good boy.
you know?

1185
00:58:28.299 --> 00:58:31.928
-Hudson: Uh-huh.
-Friend: So I just thought
I'd drop you the note

1186
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:34.973
and see if you
did want to say hello
to him. because. uh...

1187
00:58:35.056 --> 00:58:39.144
-Hudson: Yeah. Well...
-Friend: He's just a damn
fun boy. you know?

1188
00:58:39.185 --> 00:58:40.520
Hudson:
Mm-hmm.

1189
00:58:40.603 --> 00:58:42.605
Uh-huh.

1190
00:58:42.647 --> 00:58:44.983
How's the equipment?
(chuckles)

1191
00:58:45.025 --> 00:58:47.485
Friend:
Well. the equipment
is about. oh.

1192
00:58:47.527 --> 00:58:49.195
about nine inches. I guess.

1193
00:58:49.279 --> 00:58:52.365
And he's. he's. uh. very good

1194
00:58:52.449 --> 00:58:55.493
-in that department too.
-Hudson: Yeah.

1195
00:58:55.577 --> 00:58:58.663
-Friend: When's coming
some free time for you?
-Hudson: Well. most any day.

1196
00:58:58.747 --> 00:59:01.875
Friend: Well. my friend.
I'll get on the horn
and give him your number.

1197
00:59:01.958 --> 00:59:03.960
-Hudson: Okey-doke.
-Friend:
And nice talking to you.

1198
00:59:04.002 --> 00:59:05.628
-Hudson: All right. thank you.
-Friend: Bye-Bye.

1199
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:07.339
(phones click)

1200
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:09.924
Interviewer:
Mr. Maupin. you are. um.

1201
00:59:10.008 --> 00:59:13.053
a well-known writer here
in this. uh. Bay Area.

1202
00:59:13.136 --> 00:59:16.681
You have written. um. regular
columns for the newspapers.

1203
00:59:16.765 --> 00:59:18.516
Your books
have been published.

1204
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.727
I guess you'd call yourself
a gay writer.

1205
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:22.771
Maupin:
I'm a writer who is gay.

1206
00:59:22.854 --> 00:59:25.190
My ability to write.
for instance.

1207
00:59:25.231 --> 00:59:26.441
about a heterosexual romance

1208
00:59:26.524 --> 00:59:29.986
increased considerably after
I was willing to acknowledge

1209
00:59:30.028 --> 00:59:32.947
the nature
of my romantic involvements.

1210
00:59:33.031 --> 00:59:35.367
I met Rock when he came
to San Francisco.

1211
00:59:35.408 --> 00:59:37.035
(funky music)

1212
00:59:37.077 --> 00:59:39.204
He was up doing something
with "McMillan & Wife:...

1213
00:59:39.245 --> 00:59:41.122
(gun firing)

1214
00:59:44.834 --> 00:59:46.753
...and he invited
a bunch of us

1215
00:59:46.836 --> 00:59:48.922
to come up
to his suite at the hotel.

1216
00:59:49.005 --> 00:59:52.509
And at a certain point.
he rose and said.

1217
00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:54.135
"I have a little reading
I want to do."

1218
00:59:54.219 --> 00:59:58.139
And he read the first chapter
of "Tales of the City"

1219
00:59:58.223 --> 01:00:00.725
to the assembled crowd.

1220
01:00:00.767 --> 01:00:03.978
It was Mary Ann.
the newcomer in town.

1221
01:00:04.062 --> 01:00:06.856
telling her mother
that she was gonna
live in San Francisco.

1222
01:00:06.898 --> 01:00:09.150
And her mother freaks out
and says.

1223
01:00:09.234 --> 01:00:10.902
"Well. you can't.
but I was just watching

1224
01:00:10.944 --> 01:00:12.404
"'McMillan & Wife'
last night.

1225
01:00:12.445 --> 01:00:15.407
and the place is running over
with serial killers."

1226
01:00:16.241 --> 01:00:18.827
-You all right. Commissioner?
-Yeah. I'm fine.

1227
01:00:20.286 --> 01:00:21.413
Is this the gun he used?

1228
01:00:21.454 --> 01:00:23.039
Maupin:
That was so bizarre.

1229
01:00:23.081 --> 01:00:27.002
You can imagine.
McMillan himself
was reading this to me.

1230
01:00:27.085 --> 01:00:29.379
You know. he could have been
a little less drunk

1231
01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:30.588
when he read the thing.

1232
01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:33.174
but. uh. he was
somewhat slurred.

1233
01:00:33.258 --> 01:00:37.846
but it was
Rock Hudson reading my work.

1234
01:00:37.929 --> 01:00:40.807
I think he sort of expected it
to charm the pants off of me.

1235
01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:43.685
And. uh. it more or less did.

1236
01:00:43.768 --> 01:00:45.395
(cool jazz music)

1237
01:00:45.437 --> 01:00:48.940
We got up
to the Fairmont Hotel.
the Diplomat Suite.

1238
01:00:49.024 --> 01:00:52.777
and Rock led me
into the living room

1239
01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:55.196
and we're sort of
at each other right away.

1240
01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:00.076
And. uh. every movie
I'd ever seen him in was
playing before my eyes.

1241
01:01:00.118 --> 01:01:04.748
You know. I really
was not up to the task.

1242
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:06.750
I think that's
the best way to put it.

1243
01:01:06.791 --> 01:01:09.627
In an effort to console me.
he said.

1244
01:01:09.711 --> 01:01:12.380
"You know. I'm just
a normal guy like you."

1245
01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:14.966
And I said.
"And I'm Doris Day."

1246
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.927
(laughs) I saw him
off and on after that

1247
01:01:17.969 --> 01:01:21.139
from times he would come
and visit in San Francisco.

1248
01:01:21.222 --> 01:01:23.975
or he'd invite me down
to "The Castle."
as they called it.

1249
01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:26.353
And. uh.
the friendship kind of grew

1250
01:01:26.436 --> 01:01:28.855
over that period of time.

1251
01:01:28.938 --> 01:01:31.816
But I never considered him
boyfriend material

1252
01:01:31.858 --> 01:01:33.693
or he me. for that matter.

1253
01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:35.445
We were playmates.

1254
01:01:35.487 --> 01:01:38.448
And that was fine with me.
just the way that worked.

1255
01:01:40.658 --> 01:01:42.369
I had a bee in my bonnet
at the time.

1256
01:01:42.452 --> 01:01:44.829
I said. "You need
to come out of the closet.

1257
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:46.539
and I'm the guy that can help
you with that.

1258
01:01:46.623 --> 01:01:50.752
I'll know how to do that.
not in a sensationalist way."

1259
01:01:50.835 --> 01:01:54.673
And Rock listened.
He was really listening to me.

1260
01:01:54.714 --> 01:01:57.842
Um. but... (chuckles)

1261
01:01:57.926 --> 01:02:00.470
Tom. his partner at the time.

1262
01:02:00.512 --> 01:02:03.431
said.
"Not until my mother dies."

1263
01:02:04.099 --> 01:02:07.560
Um... and I thought.
"What an odd thing to say."

1264
01:02:07.644 --> 01:02:09.354
If I was fucking Rock Hudson.

1265
01:02:09.437 --> 01:02:12.691
I would want my mother
to know immediately. (chuckles)

1266
01:02:12.732 --> 01:02:16.611
Oh. it's you!
I. I wasn't sure.

1267
01:02:16.695 --> 01:02:20.073
Hiding in closets
isn't going to cure you.

1268
01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:22.200
(serene music)

1269
01:02:22.283 --> 01:02:24.202
Maupin:
Mark and George and Rock.

1270
01:02:24.244 --> 01:02:27.664
and Tom I guess. they were
slightly ridiculous to me.

1271
01:02:27.706 --> 01:02:30.834
The pride
they took in hiding.

1272
01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:35.088
I felt like I was a member
of a new generation
that wanted to show them.

1273
01:02:35.171 --> 01:02:37.716
it doesn't have
to be that way.

1274
01:02:37.757 --> 01:02:39.384
(contemplative music)

1275
01:02:39.426 --> 01:02:42.762
In the book. I depicted a guy
that was kind of fascinated

1276
01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.431
by the idea of gay liberation.

1277
01:02:44.514 --> 01:02:46.016
but couldn't quite do it
himself.

1278
01:02:46.057 --> 01:02:48.727
I tried to capture his
humanity.

1279
01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:51.521
his big. sweet. loving heart.

1280
01:02:51.563 --> 01:02:53.106
And I think I did.

1281
01:02:53.189 --> 01:02:55.233
I often did that. uh.
with "Tales of the City."

1282
01:02:55.316 --> 01:02:59.029
I sometimes put
real people into it
with their permission.

1283
01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:01.656
I knew he wasn't
gonna give me my permission.

1284
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.367
so I just did it
and blanked out the name

1285
01:03:04.451 --> 01:03:06.244
in the Victorian tradition.

1286
01:03:06.578 --> 01:03:08.788
I'm so glad I did. actually.

1287
01:03:08.872 --> 01:03:12.292
because I established
that character in the books

1288
01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:17.088
before Rock died.
saying. this person exists.

1289
01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:19.257
but he can't show you
who he is

1290
01:03:19.299 --> 01:03:22.093
because his life
is shut off in this way.

1291
01:03:22.177 --> 01:03:26.264
Hudson:
Hey. Freddy. you're really
gonna love San Francisco.

1292
01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:27.557
Yeah?

1293
01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:30.518
I want you to know you can
change your mind at any time.

1294
01:03:30.602 --> 01:03:32.354
Ah. don't worry
about me. baby.

1295
01:03:32.437 --> 01:03:35.190
I've been missing the ring.
I'm ready for a little action.

1296
01:03:35.273 --> 01:03:37.233
Masseur:
That about does it.
Commissioner.

1297
01:03:37.275 --> 01:03:39.944
Yeah. sure does.

1298
01:03:39.986 --> 01:03:42.447
-Thanks.
-You're welcome. sir.

1299
01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:45.450
-See you in the shower.
-Freddy: Okay. baby.

1300
01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:54.376
(Kijak speaking)

1301
01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:57.754
Maley: I probably wasn't
wearing a bathing suit.

1302
01:03:57.796 --> 01:03:59.172
(Kijak and Maley laughing)

1303
01:03:59.255 --> 01:04:02.550
Maley:
I was working a lot
all through the '70s

1304
01:04:02.634 --> 01:04:04.719
in various gay rights issues.

1305
01:04:04.803 --> 01:04:06.846
And I was the point person

1306
01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:08.598
for international
and national media

1307
01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:14.104
who came to San Francisco
to do stories
about gay rights.

1308
01:04:15.146 --> 01:04:19.192
Fairly early on in having
met Rock. I suggested that.

1309
01:04:19.275 --> 01:04:23.988
"Maybe you'd like to go out
and to a sex club."

1310
01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:25.949
"Oh. well. of course."
(laughs)

1311
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:27.325
There was no hesitation.

1312
01:04:27.367 --> 01:04:30.495
Like. "Are you sure?
No. I shouldn't--" No.

1313
01:04:30.537 --> 01:04:33.498
So there was this place
down on Sixth Street

1314
01:04:33.581 --> 01:04:34.916
called The Glory Holes.

1315
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.752
And so we go in
and we walk around

1316
01:04:37.794 --> 01:04:40.672
and sort of explain
how it all works.

1317
01:04:40.714 --> 01:04:43.174
And there was a balcony

1318
01:04:43.258 --> 01:04:45.760
that you could go up above

1319
01:04:45.844 --> 01:04:49.014
and look out over
the whole enterprise.

1320
01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:52.517
You can see all the traffic
around the aisleways.

1321
01:04:52.559 --> 01:04:57.689
And so we watched Rock
walk around and go in a booth

1322
01:04:57.772 --> 01:04:59.858
and you could hear
this scream.

1323
01:04:59.941 --> 01:05:02.360
"Oh. my God.
it's Rock Hudson!"
(laughs)

1324
01:05:02.444 --> 01:05:04.946
And it went
all throughout the place.

1325
01:05:04.988 --> 01:05:07.449
It obviously didn't bother him
because we didn't leave.

1326
01:05:07.532 --> 01:05:10.577
and we stayed.
stayed quite a while.

1327
01:05:11.578 --> 01:05:16.958
I think he became so
comfortable
with the dual life.

1328
01:05:17.042 --> 01:05:20.712
but I think
that he found a way to be
comfortable with both lives.

1329
01:05:20.754 --> 01:05:23.882
-You've gotta
tell them the truth.
-Do you know what'll happen?

1330
01:05:23.923 --> 01:05:25.842
I know it'll mean
you'll lose your job

1331
01:05:25.884 --> 01:05:27.552
and your customers
and everything. but...

1332
01:05:27.594 --> 01:05:28.970
you've got to do that.

1333
01:05:29.054 --> 01:05:30.847
Once you start fooling people.
you have to go on

1334
01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:33.266
and keep on fooling them
and. and...

1335
01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:37.562
you're too nice a guy
to. to. to be a phony

1336
01:05:37.604 --> 01:05:39.898
and keep on being a phony.

1337
01:05:39.939 --> 01:05:41.691
(sighs)

1338
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:45.236
You know. Hollywood at night
can be a fascinating place.

1339
01:05:45.278 --> 01:05:48.448
but Hollywood in the daytime
can be a lot of fun too.

1340
01:05:48.531 --> 01:05:51.368
Come on. follow me
and I'll show you what I mean.

1341
01:05:51.409 --> 01:05:52.243
(cool jazz music)

1342
01:05:52.327 --> 01:05:54.537
Maupin:
Rock had a contact.

1343
01:05:54.579 --> 01:05:56.790
Somebody in West Hollywood
that could round up

1344
01:05:56.873 --> 01:05:59.751
gorgeous men
at a moment's notice.

1345
01:05:59.834 --> 01:06:02.837
Wes Wheadon:
I knew a lot of folks
in the community.

1346
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:04.130
I had a lot of friends.

1347
01:06:04.214 --> 01:06:05.715
And so I would
just call up. you know.

1348
01:06:05.757 --> 01:06:08.343
whoever I'd get my hands on
that was available

1349
01:06:08.426 --> 01:06:10.261
and say. "Here's the deal.
here's the address.

1350
01:06:10.345 --> 01:06:12.013
"show up.
it'll be a lovely time.

1351
01:06:12.097 --> 01:06:14.933
"and you can have a nice day
swimming and carrying on
with drinks.

1352
01:06:14.974 --> 01:06:16.935
and you'd get to meet Rock."

1353
01:06:17.018 --> 01:06:20.563
Maley: Then it would just be
chaise lounges

1354
01:06:20.605 --> 01:06:23.149
and boys in the pool.

1355
01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:25.443
It was clothing optional.

1356
01:06:25.485 --> 01:06:28.947
And a lot of 'em. fortunately.
did take the option.

1357
01:06:28.988 --> 01:06:30.448
(chuckles)

1358
01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:34.285
Maupin: You know. even for
an ordinary gay man like me.

1359
01:06:34.327 --> 01:06:36.204
that was an amazing thing
to see

1360
01:06:36.287 --> 01:06:37.872
all these beauties
gathered around the pool.

1361
01:06:37.956 --> 01:06:40.333
Wheadon:
If you're gonna have a party
with a bunch of young men.

1362
01:06:40.417 --> 01:06:42.419
you want to bring up
the eye candy. if you will.

1363
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.547
Maley:
It was a lot of beefcake.

1364
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:48.550
and it would last
all afternoon.

1365
01:06:48.633 --> 01:06:51.177
Endless. you know.
food and drink.

1366
01:06:51.261 --> 01:06:55.098
and Rock sort
of just strolling through.

1367
01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.224
It was theater.

1368
01:06:56.307 --> 01:07:01.146
(upbeat jazz music)

1369
01:07:01.187 --> 01:07:02.731
(sign creaking)

1370
01:07:02.814 --> 01:07:06.109
(peaceful music)

1371
01:07:06.151 --> 01:07:10.864
Kevoian:
In 1976. I was cast in a play
called "John Brown's Body."

1372
01:07:10.947 --> 01:07:14.784
It starred Rock Hudson.
Claire Trevor.
and Leif Erickson.

1373
01:07:14.826 --> 01:07:20.665
It was a really beautiful mix
of music and dance and vocal.

1374
01:07:20.707 --> 01:07:24.544
So that's. you know. that's
how I came to meet Rock Hudson.

1375
01:07:24.627 --> 01:07:28.465
Hudson:
Armies of shadows
and the shadow-sound.

1376
01:07:28.506 --> 01:07:32.177
Male Chorus:
♪ Captain Ball
was a Yankee slaver ♪

1377
01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.553
♪ Blow. blow... ♪

1378
01:07:33.636 --> 01:07:38.183
He really showed
a lot of people something new.

1379
01:07:38.224 --> 01:07:42.020
and it felt good to him
as a performer on stage.

1380
01:07:42.103 --> 01:07:44.981
He was really happy.

1381
01:07:45.023 --> 01:07:48.318
It was supposed to be
a fabulous big tour.

1382
01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:52.197
and we had
a lot of cities set.

1383
01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:57.744
but. um. some people started
to cancel the production.

1384
01:07:57.827 --> 01:08:01.414
I think the people that
wanted to see Rock Hudson

1385
01:08:01.498 --> 01:08:04.751
wanted to see "McMillan"
or "Pillow Talk."

1386
01:08:04.834 --> 01:08:08.713
and the people that wanted
to see "John Brown's Body."

1387
01:08:08.755 --> 01:08:12.801
because it was so lyrical
in its speech.

1388
01:08:12.884 --> 01:08:15.220
wanted Laurence Olivier.

1389
01:08:15.261 --> 01:08:16.720
(mellow jazz music)

1390
01:08:16.763 --> 01:08:20.392
We remained friends
for several years afterwards.

1391
01:08:20.433 --> 01:08:22.560
He helped me start
a television career

1392
01:08:22.644 --> 01:08:27.357
on the last season
of "McMillan" in 1976

1393
01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:30.026
and changed
the trajectory of my life.

1394
01:08:30.068 --> 01:08:32.112
Man (on radio):
You got Big Smokey there?

1395
01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:34.072
Uh. here beside me.

1396
01:08:34.154 --> 01:08:35.740
"Big Smokey"?

1397
01:08:35.823 --> 01:08:37.742
That's you. sir.
It's CB talk.

1398
01:08:37.826 --> 01:08:41.287
Kevoian:
And he didn't cast me
from a casting couch.

1399
01:08:41.371 --> 01:08:43.915
There was only one time
that he ever.

1400
01:08:43.997 --> 01:08:47.585
um. asked me to possibly
be intimate.

1401
01:08:47.627 --> 01:08:52.006
And I. I chose.
um. the different path.

1402
01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:53.966
(chuckles)

1403
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:57.429
I was 23 and a lot cuter.

1404
01:08:58.971 --> 01:09:01.265
He was fun
and then he was elegant.

1405
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:07.063
and. you know. I only saw him
pee in the bushes once.

1406
01:09:07.104 --> 01:09:09.441
(chuckling)

1407
01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:14.738
Hey! What's going on here?

1408
01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:16.531
(wolf whistle)

1409
01:09:16.613 --> 01:09:18.116
Observe.

1410
01:09:18.198 --> 01:09:20.743
Hmmph!

1411
01:09:20.785 --> 01:09:22.578
(lyrical music)

1412
01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:26.875
McGillin:
I was one of the members
of the last dying gasp

1413
01:09:26.957 --> 01:09:28.335
of the studio system.

1414
01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:30.377
which was Universal Studios.

1415
01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:33.548
I'll never forget this great
head of the talent department.

1416
01:09:33.631 --> 01:09:37.301
She's on the phone. "Darling.
are you sitting down?"

1417
01:09:37.385 --> 01:09:39.679
And I said.
"Yes. I'm sitting down."

1418
01:09:39.763 --> 01:09:44.309
She says. "Rock Hudson.
you're going to be
playing his son."

1419
01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:47.604
(upbeat theme playing)

1420
01:09:47.645 --> 01:09:50.774
It was a 10-hour
epic mini-series

1421
01:09:50.814 --> 01:09:53.484
that they were doing
tons of at that time.

1422
01:09:53.568 --> 01:09:57.197
And Rock plays a designer
of automobiles in Detroit.

1423
01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.616
Dad. I'm telling you.
I can handle this by myself.

1424
01:09:59.657 --> 01:10:01.076
I know you can.

1425
01:10:01.159 --> 01:10:02.494
I'm proud that
you want to.

1426
01:10:02.535 --> 01:10:04.746
McGillin: Even though
you knew the rumors.

1427
01:10:04.829 --> 01:10:08.541
you still couldn't
erase the false narrative

1428
01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:10.460
of that straight leading man.

1429
01:10:10.502 --> 01:10:13.421
That was the message
that was given to all of us

1430
01:10:13.505 --> 01:10:15.048
growing up in that time.

1431
01:10:15.131 --> 01:10:19.302
young men.
and certainly young men
who aspired to be actors.

1432
01:10:19.344 --> 01:10:21.346
For gay men like me.

1433
01:10:21.429 --> 01:10:25.350
there was absolutely
zero permission to be gay.

1434
01:10:25.392 --> 01:10:27.936
It was just not going
to be allowed.

1435
01:10:28.019 --> 01:10:30.480
So I carried that with me.

1436
01:10:32.399 --> 01:10:35.777
Well. the time has come.
You've seen the map.

1437
01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.363
Reagan is our
projected winner.

1438
01:10:38.405 --> 01:10:41.074
A sports announcer.
a film actor.

1439
01:10:41.157 --> 01:10:42.575
a governor of California.

1440
01:10:42.659 --> 01:10:45.328
We have projected
Ronald Reagan the winner.

1441
01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:47.831
Did you ever think
a few years ago

1442
01:10:47.872 --> 01:10:50.500
that Ronald Reagan.
fellow actor.
would be president?

1443
01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:52.544
I mean. is that.
an actor being president?

1444
01:10:52.585 --> 01:10:54.671
-No. I. I didn't.
-Pretty amazing. huh?

1445
01:10:54.713 --> 01:10:56.798
Yeah. it's terrific.
as a matter of fact.

1446
01:10:56.881 --> 01:10:58.758
Lee Garlington:
Well. Rock was a Republican.

1447
01:10:58.842 --> 01:11:00.802
I can't believe it.
but he was.

1448
01:11:00.885 --> 01:11:03.722
Yeah. but that was a different
generation Republican.

1449
01:11:03.763 --> 01:11:05.223
Yes.

1450
01:11:05.306 --> 01:11:08.601
Uh. he was a Republican
primarily because

1451
01:11:08.685 --> 01:11:11.062
he was friends
with Nancy Reagan.

1452
01:11:11.146 --> 01:11:12.939
Apparently pretty
close friends.

1453
01:11:13.023 --> 01:11:17.777
But she couldn't get Reagan
to say anything about AIDS

1454
01:11:17.861 --> 01:11:22.782
until finally
at one point he gave in.

1455
01:11:22.866 --> 01:11:24.743
But that was after...

1456
01:11:24.826 --> 01:11:28.204
-That was after he died.
I think. right?
-After he died.

1457
01:11:28.246 --> 01:11:29.664
The Centers
for Disease Control

1458
01:11:29.748 --> 01:11:32.125
reports that six gay men
in Los Angeles

1459
01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:35.086
have fallen ill from a strange
and mysterious pneumonia.

1460
01:11:35.128 --> 01:11:39.174
Scientists at the National
Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta today

1461
01:11:39.257 --> 01:11:40.884
released the results
of a study.

1462
01:11:40.925 --> 01:11:44.763
which shows that the lifestyle
of some male homosexuals

1463
01:11:44.804 --> 01:11:47.807
has triggered an epidemic
of a rare form of cancer.

1464
01:11:47.891 --> 01:11:49.642
Reporter:
Researchers are now studying

1465
01:11:49.726 --> 01:11:51.394
blood and other
samples from the victims.

1466
01:11:51.436 --> 01:11:53.396
trying to learn
what is causing the disease.

1467
01:11:53.438 --> 01:11:55.774
So far.
they have had no luck.

1468
01:11:55.815 --> 01:11:58.485
Rock. can you believe
the things that are
happening today?

1469
01:11:58.568 --> 01:12:00.653
(chuckles) Oh. it's
pretty crazy. all right.

1470
01:12:00.737 --> 01:12:03.865
I mean. the way everyone
dresses. the lifestyles.

1471
01:12:03.948 --> 01:12:05.200
the. the new morality.

1472
01:12:05.283 --> 01:12:07.577
Yeah. Maybe we're
getting old.

1473
01:12:07.619 --> 01:12:10.288
Look. Rock. if you
can't say anything
constructive...

1474
01:12:10.372 --> 01:12:12.665
-(audience laughs)
-Okay...

1475
01:12:12.749 --> 01:12:13.541
I'm getting old.

1476
01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:14.959
That's constructive.

1477
01:12:15.043 --> 01:12:16.294
(laughter)

1478
01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.715
Griffin:
When you consider Rock Hudson's
lifestyle choices:

1479
01:12:20.799 --> 01:12:23.968
overwork. stress.
chain smoking.

1480
01:12:24.052 --> 01:12:25.428
the alcohol intake...

1481
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:27.430
-You wanna smoke
a cigarette?
-Yes.

1482
01:12:27.472 --> 01:12:29.099
Why do you wanna
smoke a cigarette?

1483
01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.559
It's not good for you.
but you can smoke
a cigarette.

1484
01:12:31.643 --> 01:12:32.811
-You want a lecture?
-Yeah.

1485
01:12:32.894 --> 01:12:35.271
-Okay. You got it.
-I'm thinking of quitting.

1486
01:12:35.313 --> 01:12:36.981
-And then you'll do it?
-I have to quit.

1487
01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:41.027
Griffin: All of that results
in quintuple bypass surgery

1488
01:12:41.111 --> 01:12:42.821
in 1981.

1489
01:12:42.862 --> 01:12:45.115
I don't know if I could ask
everybody to let us see
your scar.

1490
01:12:45.156 --> 01:12:47.867
-But I don't think that's
the right thing to do.
-(laughing)

1491
01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:50.495
You're looking really terrific.
When are you going back
to work?

1492
01:12:50.537 --> 01:12:52.330
I think around mid-January.

1493
01:12:52.831 --> 01:12:55.041
Dr. Michael Gottlieb:
By 1982.

1494
01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:56.626
we saw how devastating

1495
01:12:56.668 --> 01:12:58.837
AIDS could be for a person.

1496
01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.130
how people developed

1497
01:13:00.171 --> 01:13:03.049
one infection after another

1498
01:13:03.133 --> 01:13:05.260
and kind of just
wasted away.

1499
01:13:05.343 --> 01:13:06.761
in front of us.

1500
01:13:06.845 --> 01:13:08.555
And it was very frightening.

1501
01:13:08.638 --> 01:13:10.265
There was little happening

1502
01:13:10.348 --> 01:13:12.434
in the way of
a public response.

1503
01:13:12.517 --> 01:13:15.812
There was no money available
to do research.

1504
01:13:15.854 --> 01:13:18.148
Jane Pauley:
You are raising the possibility

1505
01:13:18.231 --> 01:13:21.568
that people are dismissing it
because it strikes mostly
the gay community?

1506
01:13:21.651 --> 01:13:24.779
There is no question in my mind.
if this were happening to you

1507
01:13:24.863 --> 01:13:26.948
and the white. straight.
middle-class community.

1508
01:13:27.032 --> 01:13:29.784
it would've been
attended to a long time ago.

1509
01:13:29.868 --> 01:13:34.164
Gottlieb:
There was all this conservative
religious overtones

1510
01:13:34.205 --> 01:13:35.540
in the Reagan administration

1511
01:13:35.623 --> 01:13:39.544
where evangelicals
had elected Ronald Reagan

1512
01:13:39.627 --> 01:13:42.130
and in his cabinet were people

1513
01:13:42.213 --> 01:13:43.923
who essentially said.

1514
01:13:44.007 --> 01:13:45.550
"Do nothing."

1515
01:13:48.303 --> 01:13:51.014
Griffin:
By this time. Rock
had made a lot of money

1516
01:13:51.056 --> 01:13:52.557
working in television.

1517
01:13:52.599 --> 01:13:54.476
He was loaded.

1518
01:13:54.559 --> 01:13:57.771
But old friends Mark
and George. not so much.

1519
01:13:57.854 --> 01:14:00.899
George Nader had glaucoma
and had stopped acting.

1520
01:14:00.982 --> 01:14:04.903
So Rock hired Mark Miller
to be his personal secretary.

1521
01:14:04.986 --> 01:14:07.489
That not only rescued
Nader and Miller financially.

1522
01:14:07.572 --> 01:14:12.911
but it would also guarantee
that his closest friends
would remain close.

1523
01:14:12.952 --> 01:14:16.581
And of course.
through all of this. Nader
is keeping his diaries.

1524
01:14:16.664 --> 01:14:19.084
which are
a veritable gold mine

1525
01:14:19.167 --> 01:14:22.796
of eyewitness accounts.

1526
01:14:22.879 --> 01:14:27.133
Voiceover as Nader:
Thursday. May 31st. 1984.

1527
01:14:27.217 --> 01:14:29.260
Mark called at 7 a.m.

1528
01:14:29.344 --> 01:14:30.845
Something seriously wrong!

1529
01:14:30.929 --> 01:14:33.264
Nancy Reagan sent photos
from the dinner party

1530
01:14:33.348 --> 01:14:35.975
with a note saying that
Rock must have that pimple

1531
01:14:36.059 --> 01:14:37.477
on his neck checked.

1532
01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.104
It showed up in the photos.

1533
01:14:39.187 --> 01:14:41.773
Otherwise. the photos
are great of Nancy. Ronnie.

1534
01:14:41.815 --> 01:14:43.316
and Rock at the dinner.

1535
01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.402
Rock back to Beverly Hills.

1536
01:14:45.443 --> 01:14:46.903
Mark insisted that Rock

1537
01:14:46.945 --> 01:14:48.947
go to see the doctor
immediately.

1538
01:14:48.988 --> 01:14:51.741
He agreed.
Mark made an appointment.

1539
01:14:51.783 --> 01:14:54.369
Let me begin with the latest
figures from Los Angeles County.

1540
01:14:54.452 --> 01:14:57.706
Today they show
56 new cases of AIDS

1541
01:14:57.789 --> 01:14:59.874
diagnosed here
locally last month.

1542
01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:03.420
That brings the national total
now to about 10.000 cases

1543
01:15:03.461 --> 01:15:05.672
cases of AIDS.

1544
01:15:05.755 --> 01:15:08.842
Voiceover as Nader:
Tuesday. June 5th. 1984.

1545
01:15:08.925 --> 01:15:12.554
Mark called and asked me
to note the time and date

1546
01:15:12.637 --> 01:15:14.305
of all of the following:

1547
01:15:14.389 --> 01:15:18.476
At 2:25 p.m.. driving Rock
home from the doctor's.

1548
01:15:18.518 --> 01:15:23.773
he was told by Rock
that Rock has AIDS
and possible cancer.

1549
01:15:23.815 --> 01:15:27.569
A lymph gland in his neck
had just been removed.

1550
01:15:27.652 --> 01:15:29.821
Around 6:30 p.m.-ish.

1551
01:15:29.863 --> 01:15:31.990
I dialed Rock
at The Castle and said.

1552
01:15:32.073 --> 01:15:35.118
if there was anything at all.
let me know.

1553
01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:38.079
He said.
the only thing was silence.

1554
01:15:38.163 --> 01:15:40.999
I said. "Of course."
and thought.

1555
01:15:41.082 --> 01:15:43.501
"Who in the hell
am I gonna call
and talk about it to?'"

1556
01:15:43.543 --> 01:15:46.588
Interviewer:
Are you the big macho type
that nothing's gonna get?

1557
01:15:46.671 --> 01:15:48.298
No. not at all.
Not at all.

1558
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:52.385
I am. I have. like everybody
else. weaknesses and strengths.

1559
01:15:52.469 --> 01:15:54.179
But...

1560
01:15:54.262 --> 01:15:58.683
one of the strengths.
I suppose. perhaps stupidly so.

1561
01:15:58.767 --> 01:16:01.102
is that I will not be sick.

1562
01:16:01.186 --> 01:16:03.730
I will not be dependent
upon anybody else.

1563
01:16:03.813 --> 01:16:06.358
and I simply won't have it.

1564
01:16:06.399 --> 01:16:08.443
Gottlieb:
In 1984.

1565
01:16:08.526 --> 01:16:10.195
I was asked to see

1566
01:16:10.278 --> 01:16:12.072
a celebrity patient.

1567
01:16:12.155 --> 01:16:16.034
Rock Hudson.
and determined in fact
that he did have AIDS.

1568
01:16:16.076 --> 01:16:20.580
I guided him as best I could
and sent him to France

1569
01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:24.709
to participate
in a clinical trial
of an antiviral drug.

1570
01:16:26.836 --> 01:16:30.131
Most people are born gulls
and judge a man by his dress.

1571
01:16:30.215 --> 01:16:32.550
We live in a world
of phantasmagoria.

1572
01:16:32.634 --> 01:16:34.678
false forms and false faces.

1573
01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:37.389
Each man wears a mask
against his fellows.

1574
01:16:37.472 --> 01:16:39.432
Well. have you nothing
to say?

1575
01:16:39.516 --> 01:16:41.685
Aye. gimme a light.

1576
01:16:42.102 --> 01:16:45.563
Esther Shapiro:
Rock Hudson was
in a different league.

1577
01:16:45.605 --> 01:16:48.233
I always liked him.

1578
01:16:48.316 --> 01:16:52.445
He seemed to fulfill
all the dreams that.
you know.

1579
01:16:52.529 --> 01:16:55.490
I would have for a star.

1580
01:16:55.573 --> 01:16:57.742
When the time came to find

1581
01:16:57.826 --> 01:17:00.912
a person to play
opposite Linda Evans.

1582
01:17:00.954 --> 01:17:03.081
I thought about Rock Hudson.

1583
01:17:03.123 --> 01:17:08.503
So I and my publicist.
we flew to Paris to meet him.

1584
01:17:08.586 --> 01:17:11.006
I hadn't seen him
for a few years.

1585
01:17:11.089 --> 01:17:13.925
He might have been
five pounds thinner.
I don't know.

1586
01:17:13.967 --> 01:17:17.095
But he seemed incredible.

1587
01:17:17.137 --> 01:17:21.224
When he turns on that smile.
it's unbelievable.

1588
01:17:21.933 --> 01:17:24.769
He met us
and I had the script.

1589
01:17:24.811 --> 01:17:27.731
I just wanted him to read
the script and say yes.

1590
01:17:27.772 --> 01:17:31.568
And then he said. "Well.
why don't we have dinner?"
So I said. "Okay."

1591
01:17:31.609 --> 01:17:33.278
So we went with him.

1592
01:17:33.319 --> 01:17:35.989
and it was
the most marvelous night.

1593
01:17:36.072 --> 01:17:39.951
He was so energetic
and he went from restaurant

1594
01:17:39.993 --> 01:17:41.911
to bar to restaurant.

1595
01:17:41.953 --> 01:17:44.122
He kept drinking
more and more vodka

1596
01:17:44.164 --> 01:17:46.458
and he got bawdier
and bawdier.

1597
01:17:46.541 --> 01:17:49.586
And I thought. "Oh. my God.
is this ever gonna end?"

1598
01:17:49.627 --> 01:17:51.880
He held out that whole night.

1599
01:17:51.963 --> 01:17:54.674
I mean. you have no idea
what it was like.

1600
01:17:55.884 --> 01:17:58.887
And at 2:30 in the morning.
he said.

1601
01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:02.265
"I read the script
and I loved it
and I will do it."

1602
01:18:02.766 --> 01:18:07.187
Reporter: This winter
finds Hudson on location
with ABC's "Dynasty."

1603
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:10.023
You've said before
that you really didn't have
any interest

1604
01:18:10.106 --> 01:18:12.150
in coming back to doing
series television.

1605
01:18:12.233 --> 01:18:15.028
What did "Dynasty" offer
that made you reconsider that?

1606
01:18:15.111 --> 01:18:17.072
Well. I'm not on every week.

1607
01:18:17.155 --> 01:18:20.408
and. uh. uh...

1608
01:18:20.492 --> 01:18:22.160
it's a good show. obviously.

1609
01:18:22.202 --> 01:18:26.373
I mean. it's. uh. very popular
all over the world.

1610
01:18:26.456 --> 01:18:30.168
so why not to do
six or so shows?

1611
01:18:30.251 --> 01:18:34.339
Reporter: So.
for six or so shows. nobody's
saying exactly how many.

1612
01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:37.050
Rock Hudson is playing
the role of Daniel Reece.

1613
01:18:37.133 --> 01:18:39.844
a sophisticated horse breeder
with romantic designs

1614
01:18:39.886 --> 01:18:41.554
on Krystle Carrington.

1615
01:18:41.638 --> 01:18:43.515
I think he's a divine actor.

1616
01:18:43.556 --> 01:18:45.350
He's wonderfully romantic.

1617
01:18:45.433 --> 01:18:47.185
He's a lovely man.

1618
01:18:47.769 --> 01:18:49.979
Well. they told us they had

1619
01:18:50.021 --> 01:18:53.692
some superstars they were
gonna have on the show.

1620
01:18:53.775 --> 01:18:57.862
which we thought. great.
this is fun. (laughs)

1621
01:18:57.946 --> 01:18:59.864
I. of course. was thrilled

1622
01:18:59.948 --> 01:19:02.283
because I did
a "McMillan & Wife."

1623
01:19:02.367 --> 01:19:04.369
Aquarius.
How do you do. Commissioner?

1624
01:19:04.452 --> 01:19:05.787
Nicole. what a lovely name.

1625
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:08.498
Linda Evans:
And I thought. how fantastic

1626
01:19:08.581 --> 01:19:11.376
to be able to work
with him again.

1627
01:19:11.418 --> 01:19:13.128
But he was so much thinner

1628
01:19:13.211 --> 01:19:16.881
and didn't look like
he felt good.

1629
01:19:16.965 --> 01:19:20.010
I think he even said
he'd been traveling a lot

1630
01:19:20.051 --> 01:19:22.095
and he inferred that.
you know.

1631
01:19:22.178 --> 01:19:23.847
"We've all been
away on a trip

1632
01:19:23.888 --> 01:19:25.807
and caught something
somewhere."

1633
01:19:25.849 --> 01:19:29.394
So I went. "Oh. you know.
life does that to us."

1634
01:19:29.477 --> 01:19:33.815
And. uh. that's about as much
as I thought about it.

1635
01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:38.903
Voiceover as Nader:
Wednesday.
December 19th. 1984.

1636
01:19:38.945 --> 01:19:41.489
"Dynasty." Rock's debut.

1637
01:19:41.573 --> 01:19:44.534
Merry Christmas. Krystie.
it's good to see you.

1638
01:19:44.576 --> 01:19:46.995
Voiceover as Nader:
Did well. but looked bad.

1639
01:19:47.078 --> 01:19:48.788
very bad
in a couple of shots.

1640
01:19:48.872 --> 01:19:50.915
I'm here to return this.

1641
01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:56.087
How dare you come
back into my life
after what you did.

1642
01:19:57.088 --> 01:19:59.674
Voiceover as Nader:
Cameraman could have helped
more with lighting.

1643
01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:02.427
I think.
but perhaps no time.

1644
01:20:09.934 --> 01:20:13.480
Tuesday. February 5th. 1985.

1645
01:20:13.563 --> 01:20:15.023
Tonight "Dynasty."

1646
01:20:15.106 --> 01:20:18.193
and we get to watch Rock
give Linda Evans a dose

1647
01:20:18.276 --> 01:20:20.945
of some virus
in a kissing scene.

1648
01:20:21.029 --> 01:20:22.947
I will tape
the fateful footage.

1649
01:20:22.989 --> 01:20:25.116
if not too frozen in horror.

1650
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.036
akin to watching someone
receive a possible
lethal injection.

1651
01:20:28.119 --> 01:20:29.579
You look more frightened
than I was...

1652
01:20:29.621 --> 01:20:32.582
Voiceover as Nader:
Morally. how guilty are we

1653
01:20:32.624 --> 01:20:37.212
for not having said something
to someone. anyone?

1654
01:20:39.798 --> 01:20:42.467
Rock returned from work
the day they shot
the kiss scene

1655
01:20:42.509 --> 01:20:45.637
and said to Mark.
"This has been
the worst day of my life.

1656
01:20:45.679 --> 01:20:49.474
"I used every possible type
of mouthwash known to man.

1657
01:20:49.516 --> 01:20:51.142
An awful day.'

1658
01:20:51.226 --> 01:20:55.522
He also said.
"I kept my mouth closed
and so did she."

1659
01:20:56.564 --> 01:21:01.027
Evans:
When we had that scene
we had to do with the kiss.

1660
01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:03.196
that was a pivotal moment.

1661
01:21:03.279 --> 01:21:06.491
We showed up that day
and shot that scene

1662
01:21:06.574 --> 01:21:10.161
and it didn't turn out
like they wanted.

1663
01:21:10.203 --> 01:21:14.165
Nobody quite knew what to do.

1664
01:21:14.207 --> 01:21:17.168
I mean. I knew he could
deliver that kiss.

1665
01:21:17.252 --> 01:21:19.713
It's not up to me
to say anything.

1666
01:21:19.796 --> 01:21:22.298
And I let
the director handle it.

1667
01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.592
and we did it over
and we did it over.

1668
01:21:24.676 --> 01:21:27.887
And he did it consistently.

1669
01:21:27.971 --> 01:21:30.682
(Evans weeping off-screen)

1670
01:21:30.765 --> 01:21:35.812
It makes me cry because
I know he was protecting me.

1671
01:21:35.854 --> 01:21:37.897
I mean. I didn't know that
at the time.

1672
01:21:37.981 --> 01:21:39.983
I was confused at the time.

1673
01:21:40.025 --> 01:21:41.860
But in thinking back.

1674
01:21:41.901 --> 01:21:45.405
part of the reason
that I get so upset

1675
01:21:45.488 --> 01:21:50.035
is that he was doing
everything he could do

1676
01:21:50.118 --> 01:21:52.037
to make it all right
for me. in case.

1677
01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.498
'Cause nobody knew
in those days about that.

1678
01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:57.292
Touches my heart.

1679
01:21:57.375 --> 01:21:59.461
Even now.
when I think about it.

1680
01:22:01.421 --> 01:22:04.466
Voiceover as Nader:
Saturday. April 6th. 1985.

1681
01:22:04.549 --> 01:22:07.218
The three of us drove
through Joshua Tree

1682
01:22:07.302 --> 01:22:09.596
where Rock
had never been before.

1683
01:22:09.679 --> 01:22:13.308
On the way there.
the old song
"Mockin' Bird Hill" came on.

1684
01:22:13.433 --> 01:22:17.312
♪ Tra-la-la
twittle-dee-dee-dee.
it gives me... ♪

1685
01:22:17.395 --> 01:22:19.189
Voiceover as Nader:

a major decline
in his appearance.

1710
01:23:18.623 --> 01:23:22.919
That's when we began
to understand what it was.

1711
01:23:22.961 --> 01:23:25.422
Even we thought it was AIDS.

01:23:27.757 --> 01:23:29.592
I saw his hand.

-What did you see?
-The beginning of a lesion.

1715
01:23:32.971 --> 01:23:34.472
Discoloration.
Softness of tissue.

1716
01:23:34.556 --> 01:23:37.100
That could
have been anything--
yaws. psoriasis.

1717

"He looks awful." Mark says.

1725
01:23:57.954 --> 01:23:59.831
Mark broached
subject of Paris.

1726
01:23:59.873 --> 01:24:01.875

1727
01:24:01.958 --> 01:24:03.543
Rock heaved a sigh and said.

I guess I'd better
go back over there."

Reporter:
Just what is wrong
with Rock Hudson?

1730
01:24:09.549 --> 01:24:11.384
Tonight.
the 59-year-old actor

1731
01:24:11.468 --> 01:24:13.720
remains in a Paris hospital
undergoing tests.

1732
01:24:13.803 --> 01:24:16.306
but the nature of his illness
has become clouded

1733
01:24:16.348 --> 01:24:17.932
in mystery and confusion.

1734
01:24:17.974 --> 01:24:19.392
Yesterday. it was reported
that Hudson

1735
01:24:19.476 --> 01:24:21.394
had liver cancer
and possibly AIDS.

1736
01:24:21.478 --> 01:24:24.105
but today the hospital
denied the cancer story

1737
01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:26.358
and said nothing
about the AIDS rumor.

1738
01:24:26.399 --> 01:24:28.651
A spokesman just said
Hudson was tired.

1739
01:24:29.444 --> 01:24:31.363
Maupin: At that point.
I don't know what degree

1740
01:24:31.446 --> 01:24:33.907
Rock was actually
making decisions.

1741
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:37.369
but Ross Hunter
was still saying

1742
01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:42.499
Rock had anorexia
and a lot of feeble excuses.

1743
01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:43.917
(siren wailing)

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.419
Griffin:
After collapsing at the Ritz.

1745
01:24:46.503 --> 01:24:49.964
Hudson is rushed to
the American Hospital
of Paris.

1746
01:24:50.048 --> 01:24:52.509
And at that point.
it's determined

1747
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:54.469
that Hudson could be
better cared for

1748
01:24:54.552 --> 01:24:57.180
at a nearby
military hospital.

1749
01:24:57.263 --> 01:25:00.141
So Rock's publicist.
Dale Olson.
sends a telegram

1750
01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:01.893
to Reagan's press secretary.

1751
01:25:01.976 --> 01:25:05.313
in which he explains
that time is running out
for Rock.

1752
01:25:05.397 --> 01:25:08.274
And Percy Hospital
will not admit him

1753
01:25:08.358 --> 01:25:10.777
because Hudson isn't
a French citizen.

1754
01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:14.906
Would the White House
be willing to intervene?

1755
01:25:14.948 --> 01:25:17.242
Nancy Reagan declines.

1756
01:25:18.576 --> 01:25:21.204
You know. I think
that non-responsiveness

1757
01:25:21.246 --> 01:25:23.540
to the personal plea
from the publicist

1758
01:25:23.581 --> 01:25:27.085
encapsulates the entire
Reagan administration's

1759
01:25:27.127 --> 01:25:29.796
non-responsiveness
to the epidemic.

1760

Nothing. He looks wonderful.
I must say.

1764
01:25:42.183 --> 01:25:43.893
-Reporter: Did he talk to you?
-Yes. he did.

1765
01:25:43.935 --> 01:25:46.521
-Reporter: What did he say?
-He said. "How are you?"

1766
01:25:46.604 --> 01:25:48.773
I said. "I'm fine."

And that's one of
the weirdest things
I did in my life.

1774
01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:14.007
because I know that if Rock
would've been strong enough

1775
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:17.886
to decide not to tell
the world that he had AIDS.
he would do it.

uh. he say.

"That's what they want.
Yanou.

When it was over.
he went up and told Rock.

I do remember. uh. when
I first came to New York.

1824
01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.928
I was walking through
Greenwich Village

1825
01:28:24.012 --> 01:28:27.390
and I passed a newsstand
and the headline said.

1826
01:28:27.432 --> 01:28:29.392
"Rock Hudson has AIDS."

1827
01:28:29.434 --> 01:28:33.313
And it... I absolutely.
I stopped breathing.

1828
01:28:33.396 --> 01:28:36.358
I will never. ever.
ever forget that moment

1829
01:28:36.441 --> 01:28:39.819
of just. this can't be.

1830
01:28:39.903 --> 01:28:43.490
It was everything
kind of wrapped up in one.

1831
01:28:43.573 --> 01:28:46.117
It was Hollywood and the closet

1832
01:28:46.201 --> 01:28:48.286
and the fact that Rock

1833
01:28:48.370 --> 01:28:50.288
had lived his life not able

1834
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:52.374
to express who he was.

1835
01:28:52.457 --> 01:28:53.792
And it had come to that.

1836
01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:56.252
It scared
the shit out of me.

1837
01:28:56.294 --> 01:28:58.755
It made me terrified

1838
01:28:58.797 --> 01:29:02.926
of contemplating
being out in the gay world.

1839
01:29:02.967 --> 01:29:09.724
and. um. that. I think.
delayed my coming out.

1840
01:29:09.808 --> 01:29:11.851
Announcer:
What's the shocking reason

1841
01:29:11.935 --> 01:29:13.812
Rock Hudson
hid his tragic illness?

1842
01:29:13.853 --> 01:29:16.314
Why has the news terrified
his "Dynasty" costars?

1843
01:29:16.398 --> 01:29:18.692
-Inquiring minds want to know.
-I want to know.

1844
01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:23.446
Evans:
There were. to my shock.

1845
01:29:23.488 --> 01:29:25.323
people on the set

1846
01:29:25.365 --> 01:29:28.493
who wouldn't come into
the makeup room
when I was there.

1847
01:29:28.576 --> 01:29:29.953
There were people

1848
01:29:29.994 --> 01:29:31.496
who wouldn't work with me.

1849
01:29:31.579 --> 01:29:33.373
and so they had
to change scenes

1850
01:29:33.456 --> 01:29:36.126
because I might have AIDS.

1851
01:29:37.168 --> 01:29:39.754
I had personal friends

1852
01:29:39.838 --> 01:29:42.257
who wouldn't come over
to dinner.

1853
01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:44.426
I mean.
people went into fear.

1854
01:29:44.509 --> 01:29:46.594
Tremendous fear.

1855
01:29:46.678 --> 01:29:48.680
I was never afraid

what science they told me.

1857
01:29:52.058 --> 01:29:55.186
I thought. "Where's
your humanity or where's
your compassion?

1858
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:58.189
You know. what's wrong
with this world right now?"

The moment it was announced

that Rock had AIDS.

1864
01:30:13.997 --> 01:30:17.250

one concern:

any connection.

It was terrible. you know.

1868
01:30:24.883 --> 01:30:28.720
The only concern was.
"He must go out of here."

1869
01:30:29.387 --> 01:30:32.307
And I start
to call the airline

1870
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:34.225
to book to fly back to LA.

1871
01:30:34.309 --> 01:30:37.979
And as soon I was giving
the name of the traveler.

1872
01:30:38.063 --> 01:30:41.983
the answer was. "We don't
take AIDS people on board."

1873
01:30:42.067 --> 01:30:46.154
And that's why
I had to rent a plane.

1874
01:30:46.237 --> 01:30:50.450
a 747. for $250.000.

1875
01:30:50.533 --> 01:30:55.663
It was his money.
and it was the only way
to bring him back home.

1876
01:30:57.415 --> 01:31:01.961
I was made so aware
of the silence.

1877
01:31:02.045 --> 01:31:05.882

regarding AIDS.

1878

wanted to talk about it.

to become involved.

Uh. certainly no one wanted
to give money or support.

1881
01:31:14.265 --> 01:31:20.146

I finally thought to myself.

A personal message
from Hudson was read

Have you anything
to say for the fans?

Just that he was
the best friend
I ever had in the world

2031

from the wilderness...
