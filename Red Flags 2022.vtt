3
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.539
- What the hell is wrong with you?

4
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.889
Are you following me?

5
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.221
Aren't you supposed to be at home?

6
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.283
Creepy ass.

7
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.153
Why were you just standing there?

8
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.230
Max!

9
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.883
Are you listening to me?

10
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.461
- Man. I don't know what
you all got going on.

11
00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:49.290
but I ain't got nothing
to do with this shit.

12
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.669
- You're leaving.

13
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.139
You're both pathetic.

14
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.233
Worthless!

15
00:01:56.457 --> 00:01:58.657
- Come on and get rid of this crazy then.

16
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.839
- Oh. hi.

17
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.009
She's so cute.

18
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.900
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:51.749
She probably just wanted to say hi to you.

20
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.399
- Honestly. it's okay.

21
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.748
Sometimes these dogs do
what they want to do.

22
00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:56.989
- Indeed. they do.

23
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.859
But look. if you ever want to get coffee

24
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.479
or anything like that.

25
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.480
here's my card.

26
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.932
- Okay. Maxwell St. Claire.

27
00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.089
I might take you up on that offer.

28
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.433
- Well. I hope you do.

29
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.719
Well. I gotta get back to the office.

30
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.149
It was a pleasure meeting you.

31
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.983
- Christine.

32
00:04:14.983 --> 00:04:15.816
- Christine.

33
00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:17.780
Well. it was nice meeting you. Christine.

34
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.920
- Now. don't you start.

35
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.129
I don't say nothing to you
when you're scratching my door.

36
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.129
trying to chase the
terrier down the street.

37
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.780
That's what I thought.

38
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.299
- Girl. what kind of
car you said he drives?

39
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.455
- Girl. he hopped in the G-wagon.

40
00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:19.769
- Mm. Marvin with the G-wagon.

41
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.603
Okay.

42
00:05:20.604 --> 00:05:21.959
- His name is not Marvin.

43
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.199
That man name is Maxwell.

44
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.359
- My bad.

45
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.577
Maxwell with the G-wagon.

46
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.399
- But it's not even about the car though.

47
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.509
I wish you were there.

48
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.769
It's the way he talked to me.

49
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.603
I don't know.

50
00:05:36.604 --> 00:05:38.379
It was just so genuine.

51
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.529
- Well. damn. is he gay?

52
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.613
- No. at least I don't think so.

53
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.189
Why you say that?

54
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.740
- 'Cause he ain't call you yet.

55
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.547
But that's the problem.

56
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.469
- Girl. he got to be gay then.

57
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.349
- He gave me his card.

58
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.879
He doesn't even have my number.

59
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.469
- Oh. well. so much for the
him calling you first shit.

60
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.659
- I ain't calling it. man.

61
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.660
I'm not.

62
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.379
- Christine. you better call that man

63
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.719
and stop blocking your blessings.

64
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.720
- Christine French does
not call any man first.

65
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.099
- Well. Christine French
is gonna be mad at me.

66
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.952
- Why?

67
00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:20.599
- 'Cause Keke Williams gotta
get up out of this house.

68
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.773
find me somebody's son.

69
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.203
- Girl. stop.

70
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.606
- Well. listen. it's cuddle season. okay.

71
00:06:28.607 --> 00:06:31.753
And you know how much I need
to binge reels and bang.

72
00:06:34.772 --> 00:06:35.605
- Okay. I can't.

73
00:06:35.606 --> 00:06:36.699
I can't with you.

74
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.700
I gotta go.

75
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.799
- Bye. babe.

76
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.633
- All right.

77
00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:41.739
- I'll talk to you later.

78
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.740
Bye.

79
00:06:46.714 --> 00:06:49.964
Good morning. my little prince.

80
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.029
Bobby. take off those headphones.

81
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.833
I told you no devices at the table.

82
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:00.767
Mom. why are you always playing?

83
00:07:00.768 --> 00:07:02.469
Because you're
so cute when you're mad.

84
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.564
I'm not a little kid anymore.

85
00:07:03.565 --> 00:07:04.565
I'm 14 now.

86
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.979
Yeah. Mom. stop
treating us like kids.

87
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.665
Look. Bobby. you
will always be my little boy.

88
00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:14.339
If you ever try to leave this house.

89
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.209
I will lock you in your room.

90
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.108
I'm the man of the house now.

91
00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:18.964
I take out the trash.

92
00:07:18.965 --> 00:07:20.427
I mow the law.

93
00:07:20.428 --> 00:07:22.679
I even read Cedar his bedtime stories.

94
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.954
Hey. I know how to read.

95
00:07:23.955 --> 00:07:25.826
I'm not a baby.

96
00:07:55.845 --> 00:07:57.119
- Hello.

97
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.719
- Maxwell.

98
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.259
- You called?

99
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.329
- Yeah. well I was just calling

100
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.189
to take you up on your offer for coffee.

101
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.233
- Yeah. well. how does tomorrow sound?

102
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.393
- Tomorrows great.

103
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.093
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:12.094 --> 00:08:13.214
Was I interrupting anything?

105
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.042
- Just doing little yard work. you know.

106
00:08:18.043 --> 00:08:19.959
At 9:00 PM.

107
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.699
- Well. I'm a busy guy. so
when I gotta get it done.

108
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.759
I gotta get it done.

109
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.209
And besides it's super hot in Houston.

110
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.210
- That's true.

111
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.249
Well. you have my number.

112
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.349
so just text me a time and place.

113
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.350
I'll be there

114
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.883
Max is everything okay?

115
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.569
- Yeah. it's just that
my phone's acting up.

116
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.084
but look. I'm gonna get a
new phone in the morning.

117
00:08:49.085 --> 00:08:50.319
I'm gonna give you a
call about the details

118
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.759
on where we're gonna meet up. okay?

119
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.789
How does that sound?

120
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.518
- Yeah. that sounds good.

121
00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:55.352
- All right.

122
00:08:55.352 --> 00:08:56.352
Goodbye.

123
00:09:03.869 --> 00:09:04.997
- Okay.

124
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.259
Look. I'm so sorry that I'm late.

125
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.709
but I promise you the
coffee's amazing here.

126
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:54.710
Shall we?

127
00:10:55.841 --> 00:10:56.841
- Okay.

128
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.483
- Oh man. can I be honest?

129
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.529
- Have you been lying this whole time?

130
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.530
- Absolutely.

131
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.799
- Here it goes.

132
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.823
You have a wife.

133
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.669
- No. nothing like that.

134
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.970
I've been truthful. but
not completely honest.

135
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.839
When I saw you at the
park. I thought to myself.

136
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.663
man. this woman is amazing.

137
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.960
- I saw you looking at me.

138
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.343
- I definitely was checking
you out. I can't lie.

139
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.969
But look. I'm not a casual dater.

140
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.679
I'm a very busy man.

141
00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.239
So that means when I
spend time with someone

142
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.039
they're very special to me.

143
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.999
So if you're looking for something casual.

144
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.943
that isn't me because
I'm looking for a wife.

145
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:08.913
- That sounds crazy.

146
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.393
- I mean. it does sound
kind of crazy maybe to you.

147
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.213
but to me that's very important.

148
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.459
- You sure you don't have
any skeletons in the closet?

149
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.089
- I prefer my skeletons in the trunk

150
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.790
where I keep all my other baggage.

151
00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:33.918
- That was a good one.

152
00:15:06.838 --> 00:15:09.123
I can't believe this is real.

153
00:15:09.124 --> 00:15:11.338
- What do you mean?

154
00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:12.172
- Everything.

155
00:15:12.173 --> 00:15:16.145
I mean. it just Feels like a fairy tale.

156
00:15:18.113 --> 00:15:20.149
- I mean. why spend the
rest of your life fighting

157
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.500
with someone that you love?

158
00:15:23.176 --> 00:15:24.009
- I don't know.

159
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.649
I guess I'm just so used
to all the toxic men

160
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:27.823
I had in the past.

161
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.319
- On behalf of all the other species

162
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.570
that have done you wrong.

163
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.553
I intend on making everything right.

164
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.559
- I'm sure you've had
some women in the past.

165
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.260
that'll even up the playing field.

166
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.233
- Yeah. like my ex-wife.

167
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.480
- You're what?

168
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.100
- I told you I was married.

169
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.833
- No the fuck you didn't.

170
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.569
- Look Christine you're right.
I didn't tell you everything.

171
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.489
but a lot has happened.

172
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:02.999
and it's because I'm going
through a lot of things

173
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.759
that I'm still healing from.

174
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.857
- Max. we just eloped.

175
00:16:08.687 --> 00:16:10.889
Do you know how stupid I feel

176
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.313
not even knowing I'm second wife?

177
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.149
Tell me what you need me to do.

178
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.429
I can fix it.

179
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.039
Tell me.

180
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.996
- You tell me everything!

181
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.499
I want to know when you
all met. when you broke up.

182
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.197
do you still talk to her?

183
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.639
- I can do that. but it's a long story.

184
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.859
I met her in college and we
were both engineer majors.

185
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.539
So we would hang out a lot.

186
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.559
First. I thought I fell for it

187
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.609
because she made me feel important.

188
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.679
She made me feel alive.

189
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.749
After college. we got married

190
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.609
and even got a job at the same company.

191
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:49.989
After a few years.

192
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.879
she grew more ambitious and
wanted to start a business.

193
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.530
but I didn't think it would work.

194
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.359
But she still wanted to quit her job.

195
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.865
So she started a business on her own.

196
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.509
So I supported her for two years

197
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.259
while she was working on
building that business.

198
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.629
I gave her money. stayed up hours.

199
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.759
hours cultivating her ideas.

200
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.253
And when her business.
when our business took off.

201
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.519
it took off like a rocket.

202
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.839
And you know what she told me?

203
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.740
She told me I wasn't ambitious enough.

204
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.899
She thought I was stupid for
not taking the risk for her.

205
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.650
But I'm the reason why we survived.

206
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.109
Every day after that I was
emasculated at every turn.

207
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.939
The more success that she achieved.

208
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.590
the more emasculating she became.

209
00:17:39.871 --> 00:17:41.879
- So you filed for divorce.

210
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.713
- I couldn't.

211
00:17:42.714 --> 00:17:44.389
The more she tore me down.

212
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.639
the more that I believed that I couldn't.

213
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.513
I was at the bottom or
at least I thought I was.

214
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.950
One day I was working late

215
00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.709
and it was one of those days
where I actually felt good.

216
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.239
so I ordered some food from
her favorite restaurant

217
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.240
and brought it to her.

218
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:01.427
And when I got there...

219
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.442
- She was having an affair.

220
00:18:04.443 --> 00:18:07.533
With a boy
barely out of high school.

221
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.579
- I'm sorry. I made you dig all that up.

222
00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.962
but I'm glad that you
were comfortable enough

223
00:18:14.963 --> 00:18:17.165
to trust me and tell me.

224
00:18:30.134 --> 00:18:31.427
You're pathetic. worthless.

225
00:18:31.428 --> 00:18:32.415
You're pathetic.

226
00:18:32.416 --> 00:18:35.082
You're both pathetic. worthless.

227
00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:38.533
Worthless. pathetic.

228
00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:13.009
- I can't believe you
all about to leave me

229
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.639
in this bar by myself.

230
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.736
- Tanya. ain't nobody about to leave you.

231
00:19:16.737 --> 00:19:18.179
Right. you could leave with us.

232
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.279
but your silly ass trying to stay

233
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.680
and find somebody just to get some.

234
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.949
Just stay for one more hour.

235
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:24.989
We can't.

236
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.719
We both have midterms tomorrow.

237
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.320
- And if I remember correctly.
your ass got one too.

238
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.333
- Fine. I'll just call a ride in an hour.

239
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.159
- Are you gonna want
to sleep with that boy?

240
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.399
You know how you and Bobby get

241
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.909
when you're drunk and fighting?

242
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.879
- Me and Bobby are done.

243
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.501
He's worthless to me at this point.

244
00:19:42.502 --> 00:19:43.552
- Whatever girl. bye.

245
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.559
- And don't be coming
home making all that noise

246
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.359
when we're trying to sleep either.

247
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.283
I won't.

248
00:19:49.284 --> 00:19:50.598
You all be safe.

249
00:19:50.599 --> 00:19:52.529
No you be safe.

250
00:20:30.068 --> 00:20:31.842
- Are you Tanya?

251
00:20:52.141 --> 00:20:55.006
All right. you
holler that you all good.

252
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.789
Hey. I think you might have
picked up the wrong person.

253
00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:05.983
- What'd you say?

254
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.419
- The driver on my app is
different and so is the car.

255
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.473
- Oh. they're probably
picking up another Tanya.

256
00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.469
But if you don't mind.

257
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.093
just go ahead and cancel the
trip and you can just pick me.

258
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.169
- Okay.

259
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.288
How do I do that?

260
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:25.470
- Look. let me show you.

261
00:21:25.471 --> 00:21:27.442
See. all you do is just
press the button like.

262
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:54.947
- Look. look. my fiance here.

263
00:21:54.948 --> 00:21:55.781
- Fiance?

264
00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:56.614
You gotta go.

265
00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:58.869
- Babe. what you put in that
tea you gave me last night.

266
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.370
I could barely get out of bed.

267
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.899
- I just realized inconsiderate I was.

268
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.819
I'm not telling you
that I was once married.

269
00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.062
I don't know how I got this
lucky. but I promise you.

270
00:22:10.063 --> 00:22:12.963
I would never do anything to
ever jeopardize what we have.

271
00:22:13.886 --> 00:22:17.356
- Oh babe. so what else
don't I know about you?

272
00:22:22.728 --> 00:22:24.011
Max!

273
00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:25.844
Max!

274
00:22:26.851 --> 00:22:27.851
Max!

275
00:22:28.599 --> 00:22:29.599
Max!

276
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.859
Max!

277
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.860
- Yes. babe.

278
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.639
- I was saying. I bet you dinner

279
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.769
that she just probably
ended up at some guy's house

280
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.779
and left her phone unattended.

281
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.419
phone died and she forgot to text back.

282
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.563
She's probably fine.

283
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.774
- I'll take you on that bet.

284
00:22:49.775 --> 00:22:52.069
- Yeah. but you. what
do you think happened?

285
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.249
- Look. I got it.

286
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.659
She probably was drunk
from drinking all night.

287
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.529
called up a rider.

288
00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.219
probably got in the car
with some random ass guy.

289
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.109
The driver probably took
her to the guy's house

290
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.149
because she didn't want
to wake up her roommates.

291
00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.299
I'm pretty sure they were
making out in the backseat

292
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.199
and that's probably where
they dropped the phone.

293
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.739
The driver's probably
some random nature lover.

294
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.479
drove into the woods to
look at the moonlight

295
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.909
and I betcha that's where the phone was

296
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.399
and it probably died in the backseat.

297
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400
End of story.

298
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.563
- Yeah. it was basically what I said.

299
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.634
- But was it really though?

300
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.099
- And what makes you think
she didn't catch the Uber?

301
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.169
- I'm not sure if she
caught the Uber or not.

302
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.869
but I was up late worried

303
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.499
and I was stalking her on find my friend.

304
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.969
- And where was she?

305
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.639
- I'm not sure. but the last
time I saw her location.

306
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.549
she was in the woods somewhere.

307
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.800
but her phone must have died or something

308
00:23:53.801 --> 00:23:56.270
'cause I haven't seen anything since.

309
00:23:56.271 --> 00:23:57.421
- And where is she now?

310
00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.629
- If I knew where she was now.

311
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.243
I wouldn't be talking to
you about how she's missing.

312
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.353
- Back to you. Tim.

313
00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.963
- So you spent the whole
night in the car drinking.

314
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.223
Then at some point you
walked her to her ride.

315
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.080
You didn't want to take her home.

316
00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:35.570
- Look. I would love to have.
you know. taken her home.

317
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.287
but my girl was at my house that night

318
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.199
and she's not into the plus ones

319
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.400
if you know what I mean.

320
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.380
She'd kill me.

321
00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.639
- So your girl can attest

322
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.973
that you came home that night around 2:30.

323
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.249
and you're saying that you walked Tanya

324
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.313
to her car around 1:15.

325
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:20.599
Besides. you mentioned the fact

326
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.369
that you walked her to a ride.

327
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.693
Is there anything else
that stood out to you?

328
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.923
- There was this guy at the bar.

329
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.700
real creepy.

330
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:42.970
- Creepy?

331
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.449
Son. we all have choices

332
00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.109
and were faced with those choices

333
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.109
because actions that defines you.

334
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.379
and due to my actions.

335
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.493
I've lost everything that I love.

336
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.739
I thought I heard you come in.

337
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.690
- Hello.

338
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:18.319
- Damn bitch. what a girl
gotta do to get a hold of you.

339
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.569
- Girl. I'm sorry.

340
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:20.626
I just been busy.

341
00:26:20.627 --> 00:26:21.460
Doing what?

342
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.293
Lying on the couch.

343
00:26:22.294 --> 00:26:26.699
- No. actually I was
about to head to the mall.

344
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.399
You should come meet me.

345
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.521
- I'm headed to these little
badass kid's birthday party.

346
00:26:31.522 --> 00:26:33.599
Uh-huh. uh-huh.

347
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.049
- What kid's?

348
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:38.389
- Girl. devil. at least park devil.

349
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.619
Shit.

350
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.009
Nah. they're my brother's kids.

351
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.309
Girl. please pray for me though.

352
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.929
because between these badass kids

353
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.719
and they're annoying ass mama.

354
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.603
I may end up slapping somebody for real.

355
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.450
- Don't do that.

356
00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.819
- Babe girl. listen. I gotta let you go.

357
00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:55.653
I'm about to smoke something.

358
00:26:55.654 --> 00:26:58.209
I need to get my mind right for this shit.

359
00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.079

Didn't you?

372
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:23.363
What are you talking?

373
00:27:23.364 --> 00:27:25.472

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.529
- Came in about five minutes ago.

384
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:41.530
Said he heard we're looking for him.

385
00:28:41.531 --> 00:28:43.579
so he came in to clear his name.

386
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.639

387
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.640

390
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:22.703

00:29:22.704 --> 00:29:24.109
- Do you know why you're here?

392
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.289
- Yeah. of course.

393
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.689
That little bitch that's missing. right?

394
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:27.999
- We prefer that you call her a woman.

395
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.100
but yes. this is about the missing person.

396
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.313
- So what y'all need for me?

397
00:29:34.372 --> 00:29:35.659
We need everything you know

398
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.060
about the night in question.

399
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.809
- First off. I ain't had shit to do

400
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.510
with that little hoe missing. man.

401
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.579
Man. listen.

402
00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.279
Okay. I seen her at the bar.

403
00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.874
She was fine as fuck though.

404
00:29:50.875 --> 00:29:51.870
Know what I'm saying?

405
00:29:51.871 --> 00:29:54.139
But she was over there
chilling with her homegirls.

406
00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.359
- So.

407
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.429
- So?

408
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.296
I shot my shot.

409
00:29:58.297 --> 00:29:59.909
Man. she wouldn't try to hear that shit.

410
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.065
- Well that's a surprise.

411
00:30:02.186 --> 00:30:03.019
Yeah.

412
00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.193
- Look man. this chick had
the nerve to laugh in my face.

413
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.863
So fuck yeah. we had a
couple. we had some words.

414
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.173
But shit. you know what I'm saying?

415
00:30:12.174 --> 00:30:13.389
She had little friend walk up.

416
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:14.223
You know what I mean?

417
00:30:14.224 --> 00:30:15.849
- Oh and he ran you off. huh?

418
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:20.850
This guy
here. Steve Urkel. right?

419
00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.909
Negative.

420
00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.729
I shot my shot.

421
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:25.919
I missed.

422
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.920
Then I dribble my ball to another court.

423
00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:29.980
- Bullshit.

424
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.749
You want to know what we think?

425
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.079
- I mean. does it matter?

426
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.589
What you all need for me is the truth.

427
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.333
- And who said you're telling the truth?

428
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:41.963
- Fuck. I am.

429
00:30:41.964 --> 00:30:43.889
So around 11:45.

430
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.519
you get in a confrontation with Tanya.

431
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.709
- Yeah. yeah. of course.

432
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:50.639
- Then a friend cocks-blocks. right?

433
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.009
She just like brush you off
like a little lint. right?

434
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.329
So you get mad.

435
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:59.559
So you follow her outside and
you watch her get in the car.

436
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.823
Then you follow her home.

437
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.163
And when she gets out.
you confront her again.

438
00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:08.102
Right?

439
00:31:08.103 --> 00:31:10.696
That's what
you all think. right?

440
00:31:10.697 --> 00:31:12.563
Uh-huh. that's what we know.

441
00:31:13.511 --> 00:31:15.413
So what do you gotta say now?

442
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.623
You already had your one phone call.

443
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.310
- What you got there?

444
00:31:36.133 --> 00:31:37.581
- What the hell is this?

445
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.113
What's this bullshit?

446
00:31:42.349 --> 00:31:43.517
- That's evidence.

447
00:31:43.518 --> 00:31:44.602
Evidence?

448
00:31:44.603 --> 00:31:45.859
That doesn't prove shit.

449
00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.069
- See. what the fuck you mean?

450
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.863
It's right here. many timestamp.

451
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:52.039
I told you I left the spot.

452
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.459
went across the street to another court

453
00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.363
and dribble my ball. shot my shot right.

454
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.093
This time I didn't miss.

455
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.186
As you can see. you hear me.

456
00:32:04.187 --> 00:32:07.257
I went all night and the morning.

457
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.719
So is there anything else
you all need from me?

458
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.469
- No. we're done.

459
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.927
You're free to go.

460
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:24.939
- Oh shit. you know what?

461
00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.860
I'm thinking about it.

462
00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:28.087
There was this dude out there that night.

463
00:32:28.088 --> 00:32:28.921
Some dude?

464
00:32:28.921 --> 00:32:29.897
- He was a little shorter than me.

465
00:32:29.898 --> 00:32:31.719
He had a hoodie on.

466
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.263
Dude looked real suspect.

467
00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:36.749
And then the way the dude
was chilling by the car.

468
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.550
looking like he was ready to
be on some old sneaky shit.

469
00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.129
I had my gun tight.

470
00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.823
You ain't gonna catch me slipping.

471
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.690
- What can you tell us about this car?

472
00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.573
- It was a black.

473
00:32:51.574 --> 00:32:53.893
it was a black SUV Jeep type car.

474
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:58.799
Dude had the Black Ice
shit. the old school shit

475
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.359
hanging from the rear view.

476
00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.469
- Yeah. that is old school.

477
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.842
Stevens. we need to find this car.

478
00:33:04.843 --> 00:33:06.579
I'll get on it right away.

479
00:33:14.303 --> 00:33:15.247
This just in.

480
00:33:15.248 --> 00:33:18.289
the Houston Police are
finally ready to say

481
00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:21.489
that Tanya Daniels is
officially being treated

482
00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.979
as a missing person.

483
00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.009
After a few people

484
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.269
came in to give statements.
- Damn.

485
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.103
that sketch damn near looks

486
00:33:27.103 --> 00:33:28.006
like it that can be my brother
- It began to be obviously

487
00:33:28.007 --> 00:33:29.169
or something
- that there might have been

488
00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.359
foul play.

489
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.193
- I'm gonna have to call my dad and see

490
00:33:31.193 --> 00:33:32.026
if I got some siblings
- Police also might have

491
00:33:32.026 --> 00:33:32.859
running around
- a lead

492
00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.199
I don't know about.
- That might be able to link

493
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.858
to a possible suspect.

494
00:33:35.859 --> 00:33:36.692
- What?

495
00:33:36.693 --> 00:33:37.916
What's wrong?
- A black SUV

496
00:33:37.917 --> 00:33:38.910
with a Black Ice

497
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:39.743
- Doesn't your Jeep
- air freshener

498
00:33:39.743 --> 00:33:40.576
in the garage

499
00:33:40.576 --> 00:33:41.559
have a Black Ice
- And this composite sketch

500
00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:42.392
in the mirror?

501
00:33:42.392 --> 00:33:43.310
- I mean so does every other
- might be the best clue

502
00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:44.572
black person in America.
- the Police Department

503
00:33:44.573 --> 00:33:45.863
but I mean I've been having
- have as of yet.

504
00:33:45.864 --> 00:33:46.929
That Jeep since I've been in college.

505
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.282
Just can't get rid of it.
- Now I want to reiterate

506
00:33:48.283 --> 00:33:50.149
that the person in the sketch

507
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:51.245
is only wanted
- Wait!

508
00:33:51.246 --> 00:33:52.406
For questioning
- What are you trying to say?

509
00:33:52.407 --> 00:33:54.437
And there is
no evidence of a crime.

510
00:33:54.438 --> 00:33:55.393
nor whether or not
- You can't possibly

511
00:33:55.393 --> 00:33:56.226
think that's me.

512
00:33:56.226 --> 00:33:57.059
He has participated.
Do you think I'm hanging out

513
00:33:57.059 --> 00:33:57.892
in college bars or something?

514
00:33:57.892 --> 00:33:58.870
- I'm just saying
- That's all I have for now.

515
00:33:58.871 --> 00:34:00.649
If you snuck out in
the middle of the night

516
00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:03.443
and decided to go bar
hopping. I'm okay with that.

517
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:05.913
- Come on. get up.

518
00:34:05.914 --> 00:34:06.966
- For what?

519
00:34:06.967 --> 00:34:07.800
- You know for what.

520
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.770
I mean. I get it.

521
00:34:08.771 --> 00:34:11.359
The vehicle. the Black Ice in the mirror.

522
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.376
I mean. I see why you think that's me.

523
00:34:13.377 --> 00:34:15.327
but let me show you why it's not. okay?

524
00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.319
So since you don't trust me.

525
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.519
I'm gonna have to give
you a reason to trust me.

526
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.119
The keys are in the driver's
side inside the visor.

527
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.863
Go ahead. take it for a spin.

528
00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:42.133
- First off. I want you to
know that I do trust you.

529
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.720
- Sure. babe.

530
00:34:44.721 --> 00:34:46.229
Start the car.

531
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.381
Go ahead.

532
00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.089
See. the car hasn't even started in years.

533
00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.169
In fact. I had the tow it in the house

534
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:41.919
and push it into the garage.

535
00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.570
I only keep it to remind me
that dreams do come true.

536
00:35:51.112 --> 00:35:51.945
Babe.

537
00:35:51.945 --> 00:35:52.778
What. hey?

538
00:35:52.778 --> 00:35:53.722
- I forgot I got a
surprise I gotta show you.

539
00:35:53.722 --> 00:35:54.555
Come on.

540
00:35:54.556 --> 00:35:55.659
- A surprise.
- Yes. come on.

541
00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:56.493
What surprise?

542
00:35:56.493 --> 00:35:57.326
- Babe. I gotta show you. come on.

543
00:35:57.327 --> 00:35:58.969
If it was a surprise. it
wouldn't be a surprise.

544
00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.826
If I told you it wouldn't be a surprise.

545
00:36:00.827 --> 00:36:01.660
Okay.

546
00:36:01.661 --> 00:36:03.327
Come on.

547
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:26.490
- How you feeling?

548
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.260
- Not good.

549
00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:32.609
Tanya's parents said
that they haven't heard

550
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:34.600
from her in two weeks

551
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.969
and that she's missed all her classes.

552
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.933
- Yeah. she missed her midterms as well.

553
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.039
- She's got a 3.7 GPA.

554
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.393
It's no way I'm buying that
she just got up and ran away.

555
00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.929
- Hey. what about the boyfriend?

556
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.749
I heard they were breaking up
the night she went missing.

557
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:52.750
- Puerto Rico?

558
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.530
That's the reason she was mad.

559
00:36:56.397 --> 00:36:57.839
Apparently. her boyfriend got drunk

560
00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.613
and posted the wrong pictures.

561
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.453
Believe leave me. he had
nothing to do with this.

562
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.029
- So what the hell are
we supposed to do. huh?

563
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:08.729
The ride she was supposed
to get got canceled

564
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.579
and five minutes later.
pick someone else up.

565
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.219
So that guy's out.

566
00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.860
Who the hell did she get in the car with?

567
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.039
What is it?

568
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.009
Omar said that he was leaving

569
00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.219
and he saw a short African male

570
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.944
standing outside with a hoodie.

571
00:37:24.945 --> 00:37:27.595
- The one with the Black
Ice in the rear view mirror.

572
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:30.930
- And I'm not judging.

573
00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.783
but Omar. you know.
all these scars he has.

574
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:38.759
no stranger to alpha men.

575
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.860
that's because he's an alpha male himself.

576
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.550
So what's a guy like that

577
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.130
being scared of a guy
standing outside of a bar?

578
00:37:54.777 --> 00:37:58.469
Unless this guy really was
sending off some crazy vibes.

579
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.539
- No. that's definitely on top of my list.

580
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.940
but Jordan said he put
Tanya in the car himself.

581
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.463
- What color did Jordan said his ride was?

582
00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.620
- Black.

583
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:20.400
So do you think the perp
was posing as a ride driver?

584
00:38:22.453 --> 00:38:24.629
- You know it makes perfect sense

585
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.530
and those are the only two
links that we can put together.

586
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.609
- So if we find the man
with the black hoodie

587
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:31.949
with a black SUV.

588
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.953
we'll find out who picked
up Tanya that night.

589
00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.419
- Yeah.

590
00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.347
And possibly the last
person that saw her alive.

591
00:38:44.726 --> 00:38:47.410
- You know what that means if it's true.

592
00:38:50.678 --> 00:38:54.011
- That means that there could be others.

593
00:38:56.148 --> 00:38:58.705
- Probably dealing with
a serial killer here.

594
00:38:58.706 --> 00:38:59.706
- Shit.

595
00:42:17.656 --> 00:42:20.866
Like I was saying.

596
00:42:20.867 --> 00:42:22.849
if you have any ounces.

597
00:42:29.278 --> 00:42:30.636
Repeat that?

598
00:42:32.834 --> 00:42:35.129
I said. "Fuck you".

599
00:42:39.163 --> 00:42:42.046
Your homeboy
said the same thing.

600
00:42:42.047 --> 00:42:45.380
but he squealed a little bit afterwards.

601
00:42:48.203 --> 00:42:49.944
- What's up. stranger?

602
00:43:42.607 --> 00:43:44.657
- Any chance these girls are still alive?

603
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.023
- We catch him. then we'll find out.

604
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.743
Until then. I don't have a fucken' clue.

605
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:21.613
- Hey babe. who's in the driveway?

606
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:26.297
- Darnell. this is my husband. Max.

607
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.453
Max. Darnell is my brother.

608
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:33.939
- Brother.

609
00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.240
- At least this was the
birth certificate say.

610
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:39.809
And when I heard my baby sister
went off and got married.

611
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.510
I had to come see this for myself.

612
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:45.350
Damn girl. you always knew
how to keep us on our toes.

613
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:48.583
- Don't I know it.

614
00:44:48.584 --> 00:44:49.926
Well. hey. maybe we can all go out

615
00:44:49.927 --> 00:44:50.999
and get something to eat.

616
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.616
I'll make a reservation.
probably at my restaurant.

617
00:44:52.617 --> 00:44:53.450
- No. no. babe.

618
00:44:53.451 --> 00:44:54.979
I already started cooking.

619
00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:56.939
My brother swears I'm the only one

620
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.940
that knows how to make chicken and rice.

621
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:01.690
- You're the closest thing to Grandma.

622
00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.995
- God. I love that woman's cooking.

623
00:45:04.996 --> 00:45:05.996
Man.

624
00:45:06.763 --> 00:45:09.449
- Man. that lady cooked all
up until the day she died.

625
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:10.959
- She did.

626
00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.960
- Dang.

627
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:15.679
Speaking of dying.

628
00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.009
man. what's up with all them girls

629
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:18.620
coming up missing around here.

630
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:20.703
- Hopefully. they turn up.

631
00:45:20.704 --> 00:45:22.079
You know how those college girls are.

632
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.680
always partying. just trying
to blow some steam off.

633
00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.714
- Don't I know.

634
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.883
- In five. four. three. two. rolling.

635
00:45:42.486 --> 00:45:46.516
- New evidence has come to
us via the Houston Police.

636
00:46:02.799 --> 00:46:06.259
New evidence has come to
us via the Houston Police

637
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:09.829
behind the disappearances
in the Houston area.

638
00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:12.843
The police believe that the disappearances

639
00:46:12.844 --> 00:46:15.253
all lead to one individual.

640
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.589
The police urge the citizens.

641
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:22.869
if you see or have heard from this person.

642
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:25.483
please contact the crime hotline.

643
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:29.189
The police believe that the suspect

644
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.869
is targeting young professionals

645
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:34.979
or collegiate African American women.

646
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:35.813
At this time.

647
00:46:35.814 --> 00:46:39.039
there is no additional
information on the suspect.

648
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.209
but once again.

649
00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:44.769
the Houston Police are
urging the public to call in

650
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:46.763
for any additional information.

651
00:46:48.428 --> 00:46:49.428
- Ah man.

652
00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.069
I see why you never come home.

653
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:55.809
buddy. been waiting on you hand and foot.

654
00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.339
- I mean. I think it's essential

655
00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.039
that a man should take care of his woman.

656
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.232
especially if she's perfect.

657
00:47:07.031 --> 00:47:09.333
Perfect. my little sister.

658
00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:13.530
Perfect. don't run from their past.

659
00:47:16.358 --> 00:47:20.639
But look. any man can love
what they think is perfect.

660
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.411
but reality come with imperfections.

661
00:47:23.412 --> 00:47:25.523
You're a cool dude though.

662
00:47:25.524 --> 00:47:27.423
but ain't nothing real without the truth.

663
00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.019
- That's true.

664
00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.939
But I've told Max everything about myself

665
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.919
and I feel like that's why we work.

666
00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.193
We're just comfortable
being around each other.

667
00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.439
- If you all like it. I love it.

668
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.468
Hey. but what you all think

669
00:47:44.469 --> 00:47:48.669
about the detective on this
serial kidnapping case folder?

670
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:49.820
- Oh. Detective Carter.

671
00:47:51.197 --> 00:47:52.030
- I don't know his name.

672
00:47:52.031 --> 00:47:53.139
The dude that was on the TV.

673
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:53.973
I don't know.

674
00:47:53.974 --> 00:47:55.369
- Yeah. it's Carter.

675
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:57.879
He's supposed to be one of the best ones.

676
00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:58.880
- Best of what?

677
00:48:00.423 --> 00:48:02.399
I mean. the guy hasn't
even found the bodies yet.

678
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.559
So before we jump on Carter's bandwagon.

679
00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.560
let's let the guy find the bodies first.

680
00:48:08.246 --> 00:48:10.079
- You think they dead?

681
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.689
- I mean. isn't it obvious?

682
00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:15.349
I mean. I can understand from
a parents' point of view.

683
00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:17.439
but they're just gonna have to accept it.

684
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.490
Facts are just facts.

685
00:48:19.961 --> 00:48:21.299
- Which are?

686
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.669
- I mean. time.

687
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:24.499
I mean. it's been two weeks already.

688
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.430
It's 2021.

689
00:48:25.431 --> 00:48:27.039
so I'm pretty sure they
would've seen themselves

690
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.040
on TV already.

691
00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:29.653
- Right.

692
00:48:29.653 --> 00:48:30.486
Right.

693
00:48:30.487 --> 00:48:31.900
And even if he was holding
them against their will.

694
00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:32.734
I mean. he'd hold them for a little bit.

695
00:48:32.735 --> 00:48:33.879
but not for this long.

696
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.130
You'd been killed by now.

697
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.989
- I mean.

698
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:40.333
I'm wondering what makes a
guy like that really tick.

699
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.150
- Corn ball.

700
00:48:44.151 --> 00:48:45.230
Ain't no telling. went to high school.

701
00:48:45.231 --> 00:48:47.289
probably tried to get
some action. never could.

702
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:48.579
and now he grew up resenting people.

703
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:49.822
and he want to fight.

704
00:48:49.823 --> 00:48:51.699
Only way he gonna win is with women.

705
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.166
- Well. he's a coward if you ask me.

706
00:48:54.167 --> 00:48:55.839
and I can't wait for that detective

707
00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.643
to just show what a real man he is.

708
00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:01.360
Ain't that right. babe?

709
00:49:04.334 --> 00:49:05.562
- Uh-huh.

710
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.786
- Where are we going?

711
00:49:43.787 --> 00:49:45.566
I don't know
where you going. man.

712
00:49:45.567 --> 00:49:47.752
but I got a hot date tonight.

713
00:49:47.753 --> 00:49:50.043
I thought you
said you were married.

714
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:53.009
- Happily married. man.

715
00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:54.251
That's my hot date. my wife.

716
00:49:54.252 --> 00:49:55.120
What!

717
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:55.953
Okay.

718
00:49:55.953 --> 00:49:56.786
- I gotta take off

719
00:49:56.786 --> 00:49:57.690
'cause she's getting ready to go out town

720
00:49:57.691 --> 00:49:59.539
on a business trip.

721
00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:01.369
- That's pretty nice. man.

722
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:02.670
Hey. what about the girls?

723
00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:06.330
- The girls.

724
00:50:07.816 --> 00:50:09.299
You want to know what my dad told me

725
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.819
when I first made detective?

726
00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:11.820
- What's that?

727
00:50:14.674 --> 00:50:19.127
- He said no matter how hard
the job is. don't take it home.

728
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:24.480
You see. man. these
cases are very emotional

729
00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:26.889
and like all emotions. man.

730
00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:29.359
You gotta keep them in control

731
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.643
because if you don't.

732
00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:33.719
they'll make you lose sight

733
00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.923
of what's most important to you. man.

734
00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:38.350
and that's family.

735
00:50:44.171 --> 00:50:48.921
You know I'll also tell you
this. this job will kill you.

736
00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.523
And if you let it take you down.

737
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:54.390
don't take your family with you.

738
00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.719
- Some really good advice.

739
00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.870
Imagine you and him
were pretty close. huh?

740
00:51:04.257 --> 00:51:06.473
- You know this job killed my dad.

741
00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.563
He was never one to take his own advice.

742
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.359
You know. growing up I can't even remember

743
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.713
a time where he was early for dinner.

744
00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:23.349
you know. a time when he was
on time for one of my games.

745
00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:24.600
- I'm sorry to hear that.

746
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:27.753
I'm sure he was pretty
proud of you though.

747
00:51:29.858 --> 00:51:30.858
- Of course. he is.

748
00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.799
He built the machine?

749
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.039
Let's get outta here.

750
00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.265
All right.

751
00:52:50.263 --> 00:52:51.269
- Pick up the phone.

752
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:52.103
Hey. pick up the phone.

753
00:52:52.103 --> 00:52:53.103
Come on. man.

754
00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:56.100
- Detective Carter speaking.

755
00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.353
Stay there.

756
00:52:58.353 --> 00:52:59.353
I'm on the way.

757
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:01.830
We gotta roll.

758
00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:51.059
- Detective Carter. how may I help you?

759
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:51.893
- We were actually hoping

760
00:53:51.894 --> 00:53:54.398
that we could catch your husband home.

761
00:53:54.399 --> 00:53:57.169
- Oh. you just missed him.

762
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:58.559
- We did.

763
00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.093
Would you mind telling us where he's gone?

764
00:54:01.094 --> 00:54:02.199
- I actually don't know myself.

765
00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.599
I was in the shower.

766
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.269
When I came out. I noticed he was gone.

767
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:08.319
What's this about. Detective?

768
00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.879
- Your husband wouldn't
happen to drive a black SUV.

769
00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:10.880
would he?

770
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:13.483
- A G-Wagon?

771
00:54:13.483 --> 00:54:14.316
Yeah.

772
00:54:14.316 --> 00:54:15.316
Yes.

773
00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:20.549
- Well. when he gets home.
just let him know we came by.

774
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.150
We have a few questions for him.

775
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.090
- About what exactly?

776
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:28.153
- It's probably nothing.

777
00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:31.049
but we think he might have some answers

778
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:34.553
on helping us locate one
of the missing girls.

779
00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:37.213
- What?

780
00:54:37.214 --> 00:54:38.734
Why would he know anything about that?

781
00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:43.939
- Like I said. just
have him give us a call.

782
00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:45.259
We have a few questions for him.

783
00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.336
Okay.

784
00:54:46.337 --> 00:54:47.221
- Yeah.

785
00:54:47.222 --> 00:54:49.638
Bye bye.

786
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:13.793
- So what'd you make of her?

787
00:55:15.018 --> 00:55:17.593
- I don't know yet. but I bet this.

788
00:55:19.073 --> 00:55:24.073
if her husband is our guy.
she definitely don't know it.

789
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:25.740
- Never bring work home. huh?

790
00:55:26.851 --> 00:55:29.903
Shit. you can learn.

791
00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:01.000
- Detective Carter was
looking for you today.

792
00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:03.260
- Oh yeah.

793
00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.260
What did he want?

794
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:10.493
- He thinks you know something
about the missing girls.

795
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:16.430
Do you?

796
00:56:17.521 --> 00:56:19.021
- Why would I know about them?

797
00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:23.769
- He asked about your truck.

798
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:25.039
- My truck?

799
00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.010
- Babe. relax.

800
00:56:26.011 --> 00:56:27.410
I didn't tell them anything.

801
00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:31.259
I already know how some cops can be.

802
00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.649
once they get something. they run with it.

803
00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:37.599
and we have reporters
outside lining at our door

804
00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.393
and that's the last thing we need.

805
00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.779
- Public opinion.

806
00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.689
It would ruin us.

807
00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:45.009
- I'm gonna go ahead and go in tomorrow

808
00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:46.549
and answer those questions.

809
00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:47.659
The quicker I do that.

810
00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.760
the quicker they can take me off the list.

811
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.720
- Where were you?

812
00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:55.889
- I told you I had that meeting today.

813
00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:59.639
- Oh yeah. I thought
that was this morning.

814
00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.679
- Yeah. well I had to
take care of a few things

815
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.059
so I can have everything ready.

816
00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:04.419
you know. taking care of things.

817
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.459
so I can have everything straight for you.

818
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:07.400
- Yeah.

819
00:57:07.401 --> 00:57:09.613
You know. I don't care
about that stuff. right?

820
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:16.364
- Of course. I do.

821
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:43.779
- So how things go with
our number one guy?

822
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.030
Man. I wish I could have
been there for that.

823
00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:49.039
- Shit. we both missed that one.

824
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.588
Who'd he talk to?

825
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:51.759
- I thought he talked to you.

826
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:52.939
There's a written statement on your desk

827
00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:53.990
with his whereabouts.

828
00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:30.779
- Girl. cheating!

829
00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:31.780
- Yes. girl.

830
00:58:31.781 --> 00:58:33.659
- Well. are you sure?

831
00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:34.660
- Of course not.

832
00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:40.340
But he's been going out
early and coming home late.

833
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:41.839
He's been lying.

834
00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.944
I'm just...

835
00:58:42.945 --> 00:58:44.538
- That nigga probably cheating.

836
00:58:44.539 --> 00:58:46.122
Yeah.

837
00:58:47.094 --> 00:58:47.930
- But I mean. Christine.

838
00:58:47.931 --> 00:58:49.730
you don't seem to be doing that bad.

839
00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:52.340
- What's that supposed to mean?

840
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:56.269
- It means you met a man at a dog park.

841
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:58.631
Tell me you're not calling him first.

842
00:58:58.632 --> 00:59:01.919
And then a few weeks later
you all getting married.

843
00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.717
What did you think was gonna happen?

844
00:59:05.917 --> 00:59:07.653
- So you think I'm doing too much.

845
00:59:12.143 --> 00:59:13.427
- I mean. are you happy?

846
00:59:16.162 --> 00:59:17.162
- Yeah.

847
00:59:18.355 --> 00:59:20.469
- Then just be happy.

848
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:22.309
Let's not let one assumption

849
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.203
fuck up all the good shit he's been doing.

850
00:59:26.553 --> 00:59:28.069
- You're right.

851
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:29.469
You're right.

852
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:30.979
I miss you.

853
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.019
I promise.

854
00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:32.860
I'm sorry.

855
00:59:32.861 --> 00:59:35.229
- Girl. miss me with that. miss me.

856
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:38.359
What you need to do is see if
hubby got some top brothers.

857
00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:39.749
- Oh gosh. I will.

858
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:40.730
I will.

859
00:59:40.731 --> 00:59:41.980
- Do he got any brothers?

860
00:59:43.546 --> 00:59:44.796
- I don't know.

861
00:59:45.767 --> 00:59:47.019
- Well. bitch. you need to find out.

862
00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:48.042
Okay.

863
00:59:48.043 --> 00:59:49.705
- I will.

864
00:59:49.706 --> 00:59:50.660
- Yeah.

865
00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.660
Thank you.

866
00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:54.502
- I got you.

867
00:59:57.217 --> 00:59:58.246
- To my girl!

868
00:59:58.247 --> 00:59:59.247
Oh yeah!

869
01:01:54.097 --> 01:01:55.647
- You know. I've been thinking.

870
01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:57.403
if we never find the body.

871
01:01:57.404 --> 01:01:59.173
how the hell are we gonna find the killer?

872
01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.660
- You know. that's the one
thing that still haunts me.

873
01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.623
But you know. we try
desperately to catch him.

874
01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:10.619
but we forget the fact

875
01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.629
that it might be at the
expense of someone's life.

876
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:16.939
But were always one step behind.

877
01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.839
- It's pissing me off.

878
01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.673
We're waiting.

879
01:02:19.674 --> 01:02:21.659
sitting here waiting for
him to make a mistake.

880
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.999
What if he's already made one?

881
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.750
Something we might have overlooked.

882
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.003
- That's the job.

883
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:31.560
You play chess. Stevens?

884
01:02:31.561 --> 01:02:33.469
Ah. barely. honest.

885
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:38.470
- Well. in chess. you live and
die by the mistakes you make.

886
01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:42.269
But you know. sometimes the mistakes.

887
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:45.763
they can afford you a chance to win.

888
01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:52.480
And in others. you make one mistake and...

889
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.909
- Checkmate.

890
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:58.329
- You know. we can make a few mistakes.

891
01:02:58.330 --> 01:03:02.213
but the first one he
makes. we make it count.

892
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.799
- Got another hot date?

893
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.519
- Nah. wife's outta town.

894
01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.309
Man. I'm gonna go home and get some sleep.

895
01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:14.060
That's the same thing you should do

896
01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:18.389
'cause we gonna be
setting a trap tomorrow.

897
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:21.059
We're gonna make this guy make a mistake.

898
01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.060
- All right.

899
01:07:45.585 --> 01:07:47.585
- What's wrong with you?

900
01:07:50.343 --> 01:07:52.093
- We found the body.

901
01:07:53.819 --> 01:07:57.005
- Well. we figured it
was gonna be a deceased.

902
01:07:58.116 --> 01:08:00.402
They got a positive ID.

903
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:19.229
- Carter.

904
01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:20.230
- Yeah. Carter.

905
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:22.203
Yeah. it's Gomez. man.

906
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:25.750
Yeah. we found her. your little girl.

907
01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.723
Yeah man. you gotta get down there.

908
01:08:30.724 --> 01:08:31.724
Carter.

909
01:08:47.115 --> 01:08:51.288
No. no. it's not her.

910
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:52.289
No!

911
01:08:58.573 --> 01:09:00.323
- It's getting out of hands. Gomez.

912
01:13:20.817 --> 01:13:21.897
- Babe.

913
01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:29.173
I was looking for
detergent for my laundry.

914
01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.971
