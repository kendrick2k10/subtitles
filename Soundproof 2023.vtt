177
00:11:14.848 --> 00:11:17.067
What are you doing?

178
00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:20.070
Are you fucking serious?

179
00:11:20.854 --> 00:11:23.291
Please open the door.
This ain't fucking funny. Izzy.

180
00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:26.598
Izzy. talk!
What the fuck? Open the door!

181
00:11:26.773 --> 00:11:28.296
It isn't funny. man!

182
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.776
And don't make me
break down the fucking door!

183
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.386
Open it. Please!

184
00:11:51.536 --> 00:11:53.756
Milan said you wanted this.

185
00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:55.715
Yeah. we're going
on a little trip.

186
00:11:55.889 --> 00:11:57.586
In the middle of the night?

187
00:11:58.152 --> 00:11:59.414
Maybe I'll send you
a postcard. yeah?

188
00:11:59.588 --> 00:12:02.504
God will bless you with wisdom.

189
00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:06.900
If... I am trying
to give you a blessing.

190
00:12:07.074 --> 00:12:10.599
The more you object.
the longer it will take.

191
00:12:14.777 --> 00:12:18.346
God will bless you with wisdom

192
00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:21.610
if you persist
in praying for it.

193
00:12:33.927 --> 00:12:35.624
I told you to pack
for a holiday. like a week.

194
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:41.891
Fine. Whatever.

195
00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:43.806
Come on.

196
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.981
Give me this.

197
00:12:45.634 --> 00:12:47.027

00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:55.824
Kevin.

209
00:16:17.672 --> 00:16:18.716
Kevin.

210
00:16:22.198 --> 00:16:23.199
Kev.

211
00:16:27.203 --> 00:16:28.204
Kevin.

212
00:16:31.251 --> 00:16:32.252
Hey.

213
00:16:34.384 --> 00:16:35.385
Fuck.

214
00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:43.654
You're fucking stupid.

215
00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:46.788
Fucking cunt.

216
00:16:53.969 --> 00:16:56.015
You fucking idiot.

217
00:16:59.105 --> 00:17:00.671
What the fuck have you done?

218
00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:20.343
Tu-tu. tu-tu.

219
00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:30.788
Sorry. darling. Do you have
a lighter I could borrow?

220
00:17:30.962 --> 00:17:33.530
Tu-tu. Tu-tu.

221
00:17:33.704 --> 00:17:35.228
Should I check
she's got proper food?

222
00:17:35.402 --> 00:17:36.925
We'll need milk and stuff.

223
00:17:41.147 --> 00:17:42.452
Dylan. stop it!

224
00:17:47.805 --> 00:17:49.807
- What you playing at?
- -I thought this was a getaway.

225
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:52.419
Exactly. So why are you drawing
attention to yourselves?

226
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.075
Okay.

227
00:17:56.553 --> 00:17:57.815
No. no. no. no. no. no.

228
00:17:57.989 --> 00:17:59.817
Oh. I don't believe this.
Come on. Come on.

229
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.646
-What is it?
-I don't know.
I don't know about cars. do I?

230
00:18:04.431 --> 00:18:06.215
What are we gonna do
if the car won't start?

231
00:18:06.389 --> 00:18:08.913
Well. maybe it just needs time
to cool down a bit. maybe.

232
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:11.046
- It's not
one of your boyfriend.
- Well. fuck off. Dylan.

233
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.961
Can you two please
just stop fighting?

234
00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:19.707
Let's get something to eat.

235
00:18:20.882 --> 00:18:21.839
Yeah?

236
00:18:22.013 --> 00:18:24.538
Just... leave it for a bit.

237
00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:37.812
I'd like to work
in a diner like this.

238
00:18:41.076 --> 00:18:42.295
Look at these. so cute.

239
00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:43.600
like toys.

240
00:18:47.213 --> 00:18:48.866
Can't imagine
these girls make much.

241
00:18:50.694 --> 00:18:52.218
I'd have a song. too.

242
00:18:59.964 --> 00:19:02.793

247
00:19:11.802 --> 00:19:13.326
Get something down.

248
00:19:14.022 --> 00:19:16.067
-You'll feel better.
-I don't wanna feel better.

249
00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:19.201
Look. I don't know
when we're gonna get
the chance to eat again.

250
00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:21.725
What am I gonna do about school?

251
00:19:21.899 --> 00:19:23.205
I don't know. I need...

252
00:19:23.727 --> 00:19:24.859
I need time to think.

253
00:19:28.906 --> 00:19:30.517
Do you want to get me
into trouble or something?

254
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.130
Why can't we say
it was self-defense?

255
00:19:35.304 --> 00:19:36.523
Say he was hurting Izzy.

256
00:19:36.697 --> 00:19:38.742
Look. Kevin
had his problems. yes.

257
00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:40.657
But I would never go out
with someone who hurt my kids.

258
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:41.919
Oh. yeah.

259
00:19:42.485 --> 00:19:43.878
You should probably write
parenting guides.

260
00:19:45.923 --> 00:19:48.012
Dylan. Dylan.

261
00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.884
Everything alright?

262
00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:51.277
Yeah.

263
00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:53.627
Yes. just what we needed.
Thanks.

264
00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:55.716
Actually. um...

265
00:19:56.847 --> 00:19:59.415
Uh. do you happen to know
if we are anywhere
near here at all?

266
00:20:00.503 --> 00:20:01.852
Have you heard of Google Maps?

267
00:20:04.246 --> 00:20:05.247
I'm going to the toilet.

Teenagers.

269
00:20:17.955 --> 00:20:19.914
It was a loose connection
to your starter motor.

270
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.525
Is it gonna be alright?

271
00:20:23.309 --> 00:20:24.353
Yeah. probably.

272
00:20:25.006 --> 00:20:27.008
-For a while.
-A while? How long is a while?

273
00:20:28.444 --> 00:20:30.141
What am I gonna do
if it breaks down again?

274
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:33.232
Look. where'd you say
you were going?

275
00:20:36.017 --> 00:20:37.061
Because we're going down
the coast.

276
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:38.280
If that's any good to you?

277
00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:43.546
Yeah. Okay.

278
00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.896
And if you travel with us.
you've gotta promise
to keep it running.

279

-Mom!
-Can you fix the car?

280
00:20:51.206 --> 00:20:53.991
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Okay.

281
00:21:05.873 --> 00:21:07.004
We don't know him.

282
00:21:07.657 --> 00:21:09.180
Look. he's going to pick
some bloody fruit

283
00:21:09.355 --> 00:21:10.312
or something and his mates
have let him down.

284
00:21:10.486 --> 00:21:11.966

285

324
00:24:35.343 --> 00:24:36.387
She told me what happened.

325
00:24:38.912 --> 00:24:40.304
And you know
what your brother was.

326

A piece of shit. Of course.
this was coming to him.

327
00:24:43.917 --> 00:24:46.615
She deserved more than him.
The kids deserved more.

328
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:51.664
I told her to get as far away
from here as possible.

329

come from then?

337
00:25:44.717 --> 00:25:45.718
Nowhere really.

338
00:25:48.372 --> 00:25:49.809
You must have
come from somewhere.

339
00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:53.334
Where've you been?

340
00:26:00.297 --> 00:26:01.298

don't mess about.

342
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:04.737

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.783
-What. this hand?
-Get your hand
back in the vehicle!

344
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.182
Sorry.

345
00:26:15.356 --> 00:26:16.705

348
00:26:31.894 --> 00:26:32.895

are you dreaming about?

352
00:27:33.739 --> 00:27:35.044
Must have been something bad.

353
00:27:35.218 --> 00:27:36.959
Um. alright. well. this is us.

354
00:27:37.133 --> 00:27:39.309
So. I... If I unpack
and get rid of the kids.

355
00:27:39.483 --> 00:27:40.789
I can drop you back
at the main road. yeah?

356
00:27:40.963 --> 00:27:42.704
Uh. no. it's alright. I'll. uh.

357
00:27:42.878 --> 00:27:45.054
I'll probably pitch up
around there somewhere.

358
00:27:45.228 --> 00:27:47.056
-I'm knackered.
-I thought you had
work lined up.

359
00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:50.712
I have. but I've got
a few days to kill.

360
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:15.171
See ya.

361
00:28:55.777 --> 00:28:56.778
Dyl.

362
00:28:58.562 --> 00:28:59.781
You have to do this for Iz.

363
00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:08.268
Did you sleep alright. love?

364
00:29:09.399 --> 00:29:10.487
Is there any tea?

365
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.143
Uh. God. the.

366
00:29:14.317 --> 00:29:15.362
the cook is broken.

367
00:29:16.885 --> 00:29:18.278
So. here.

368
00:29:18.844 --> 00:29:19.845
have a bit of fag.

369
00:31:05.907 --> 00:31:08.040
I need tea.

370
00:31:08.214 --> 00:31:10.999
Yeah. well. I said we should've
picked something proper
up on the way.

371
00:31:11.957 --> 00:31:12.958
Go find a shop then.

372
00:31:14.437 --> 00:31:15.438
Stop moaning.

373
00:31:21.531 --> 00:31:22.706
Oh.

374
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.154
Dylan. no. that's disgusting.

375
00:31:37.678 --> 00:31:39.114
Do you think a fox had it?

376
00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:41.290
And left it hung on a tree?

377
00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:43.510
Doubt it.

378
00:31:43.684 --> 00:31:44.728
Well. who killed it then?

379
00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:45.904
I did.

380
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:49.559
You're still here?

381
00:31:52.171 --> 00:31:53.128
Did it suffer?

382
00:31:53.868 --> 00:31:54.913
No.

383
00:31:57.741 --> 00:32:02.007
You. uh. shoot it in the head
or the back end
if you want to eat it.

384
00:32:02.964 --> 00:32:05.010
A center hit will ruin the meat.

385
00:32:06.968 --> 00:32:08.535
- See?
- That's grim.

386
00:32:10.493 --> 00:32:11.494
You eat chicken. dickhead.

387
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.892
Found the shop?

388
00:32:18.719 --> 00:32:19.981
Found the guy from last night.

389
00:32:20.764 --> 00:32:21.983
You never said he was staying.

390
00:32:22.505 --> 00:32:24.333
But...
it's a free country. Iz.

391
00:32:24.507 --> 00:32:26.031
What am I supposed to do
about it?

392
00:32:28.685 --> 00:32:30.600
I told him the stove
wasn't working.

393
00:32:31.775 --> 00:32:32.907
I can take a look if you like.

394
00:32:34.822 --> 00:32:36.867
Um... yeah.

395
00:32:47.052 --> 00:32:48.227
Hold that up.

396
00:32:49.271 --> 00:32:50.272
Harder.

397
00:32:52.796 --> 00:32:55.234
We'll use these later. but we're
gonna need some smaller tools.

398
00:32:55.408 --> 00:32:56.800
alright? Hold down there. look.

399
00:32:57.976 --> 00:32:59.890
So what we'll do is
we'll just add...

400
00:33:00.065 --> 00:33:01.414
- Okay.
- Okay.

401
00:33:03.329 --> 00:33:05.940
And then we're gonna add this.
alright?

402
00:33:10.901 --> 00:33:12.512
So. what are you gonna
cook on it?

403
00:33:13.295 --> 00:33:16.255
I don't know. Probably nothing.
I like watching it.

404
00:33:23.697 --> 00:33:25.046
You're decorating already?

405
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:27.788
Well. I can't sleep
in the dark. can I?

406
00:33:27.962 --> 00:33:29.485
God. you're like
the opposite of a vampire.

407
00:33:29.659 --> 00:33:32.184
What does that make you?
My angel.

408
00:33:34.577 --> 00:33:36.014
Actually. you might wanna
hang those back up. babe.

409
00:33:36.188 --> 00:33:37.450
You don't want him
peering in on you.

410
00:33:38.146 --> 00:33:39.147
Dyl?

411
00:34:44.691 --> 00:34:45.735
Alright.

412
00:34:46.562 --> 00:34:47.563
Dig.

413
00:34:49.043 --> 00:34:50.088
What?

414
00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:52.699
A hole.

415
00:34:55.397 --> 00:34:56.398
Dig a hole.

416
00:34:57.225 --> 00:34:58.226
Well. how big?

417
00:34:59.184 --> 00:35:00.402
As big as a grave.

418
00:35:01.751 --> 00:35:02.796
Go on.

419
00:35:14.982 --> 00:35:16.114
What do you mean
she's not at work?

420
00:35:16.288 --> 00:35:17.637
<i>
Steve at the bar said</i>

421
00:35:17.811 --> 00:35:19.378
<i>she left with Pete.</i>

422
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.858
<i>Left real quick.</i>

423
00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:24.034
And he was here. Jo.

424
00:35:25.035 --> 00:35:26.080
<i>Who was?</i>

425
00:35:26.646 --> 00:35:29.083
Pete. Kevin's brother.

426
00:35:29.257 --> 00:35:30.867
<i>I saw him.</i>

427
00:35:31.651 --> 00:35:32.565
In the flat?

428
00:35:32.739 --> 00:35:33.870
<i>Now. why would Milan</i>

429
00:35:34.044 --> 00:35:35.481
<i>go off with Pete?</i>

430
00:35:38.527 --> 00:35:40.007
You know.
Milan can handle herself.

431
00:35:41.313 --> 00:35:42.357
Don't worry.

432
00:35:43.184 --> 00:35:45.273
<i>Is there something</i><i>
you're not telling me?</i>

433
00:35:46.187 --> 00:35:48.581
Look. um. I've got to go.

434
00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:52.454
I'll call you soon
as she gets in touch. Yeah?

435
00:36:24.138 --> 00:36:25.183
Fuck.

436
00:36:27.402 --> 00:36:28.708
Pete. just leave us alone.

437
00:36:39.719 --> 00:36:40.720
Oh.

438
00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:46.029
Is that big enough?

439
00:36:55.038 --> 00:36:56.257
Lie in it.

440
00:36:57.302 --> 00:36:58.564
Pete. please.
There's no need to do this.

441
00:36:58.738 --> 00:37:00.000
Get in the fucking hole!

442
00:37:13.622 --> 00:37:14.841
Go on.

443
00:37:25.025 --> 00:37:26.069
Oh. come on.

444
00:37:28.028 --> 00:37:29.116
Where?

445
00:37:31.379 --> 00:37:32.380
To get my brother.

446
00:37:39.909 --> 00:37:43.783
Okay. Alright.

447
00:38:04.456 --> 00:38:07.110
"The body that is sown
is perishable.

448
00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:10.375
it is raised imperishable."

449
00:38:11.158 --> 00:38:12.638
"It is sown in dishonor.

450
00:38:13.421 --> 00:38:15.205
it is raised in glory."

451
00:38:15.771 --> 00:38:17.382
"It is sown in weakness.

452
00:38:18.034 --> 00:38:19.340
it is raised in power."

453
00:38:21.081 --> 00:38:22.865
"And let perpetual light
shine upon him."

454
00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:25.172
"May he rest in peace."

455
00:38:26.652 --> 00:38:27.653
"Amen."

456
00:38:34.529 --> 00:38:37.315
<i>
You can't mention anything</i><i>
about London to him. okay?</i>

457
00:38:38.794 --> 00:38:40.056
Nothing about why we're here.

458
00:38:41.231 --> 00:38:42.494
So what do we say if he asks?

459
00:38:42.668 --> 00:38:43.886
Oh. we're just on a trip.
aren't we?

460
00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.061
An adventure.

461
00:38:45.758 --> 00:38:46.889
Some adventure.

462
00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.892
And I'm.
I'm gonna need your phones.

463
00:38:50.066 --> 00:38:52.765
- For fuck's sake. Mom!
- Oi. language!

464
00:38:53.896 --> 00:38:55.158
I wanted to take some pics.

465
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:56.595
Ah. the last thing I need
is you posting

466
00:38:56.769 --> 00:38:58.292
bloody photos of the woods
everywhere.

467
00:38:59.641 --> 00:39:00.860
Come on. hand them over.

468
00:39:01.469 --> 00:39:03.602
Dyl. Thank you.

469
00:39:05.081 --> 00:39:07.170
Thank you.

470
00:39:11.827 --> 00:39:14.439
-Alright.
-I'm gonna have a real problem
reaching that. aren't I?

471
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.964
You're pretty funny. Dyl.
Yeah. these things
could get us bloody killed.

472
00:39:21.576 --> 00:39:23.448
- So. what am I gonna do all day?
- I don't know.

473
00:39:23.622 --> 00:39:24.797
Pretend it's the '70s.

474
00:39:25.667 --> 00:39:27.452
Look...
I. I need some peace.
Come on. get out.

475
00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:29.018
Get some fresh air.
Come on. outside.

476
00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:33.414
Iz. come on. please.

477
00:39:34.067 --> 00:39:35.373
Thank you.

478
00:40:13.498 --> 00:40:15.978
Hey. if you can't afford them.
please put the goods back.

479
00:40:16.152 --> 00:40:18.067
Calm down. Abdul.

480
00:40:19.112 --> 00:40:20.287
Put it on my tab. yeah?

481
00:40:35.563 --> 00:40:37.913
For God's sake.
please pay the money.

482
00:40:39.045 --> 00:40:40.307
You need to pay for your stuff.

483
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:43.876
You should fuck off.

484
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.399
Pay the man.

485
00:41:30.792 --> 00:41:32.228
Do you reckon
this would even float?

486
00:41:34.274 --> 00:41:35.493
Well. it's a boat. isn't it?

487
00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:37.712
Duh. But I don't know.
it looks rotten.

488
00:41:37.886 --> 00:41:39.018
I'll ask Tom.

489
00:41:40.976 --> 00:41:43.805
Tom?
Do you wanna marry him?

490
00:41:47.592 --> 00:41:48.636
Dyl. stop.

491
00:41:49.811 --> 00:41:51.552
-I didn't touch you.
-You did. Mm.

492
00:41:52.684 --> 00:41:54.381
Mm. Stop.

493
00:41:58.124 --> 00:41:59.038
What have you found?

494
00:41:59.212 --> 00:42:00.387
Looks like a snail.

495
00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.085
This boat is disgusting.

496
00:42:03.259 --> 00:42:05.653
<i>Wait. wait. wait.</i>

497
00:42:05.827 --> 00:42:09.265
-wait. wait. wait. wait.
wait. slow down.
-Come on. Izzy. Oh.

498
00:42:09.439 --> 00:42:12.312
Wait. I just need to change
my hand real quick. Go.

499
00:42:15.184 --> 00:42:16.403
Come on.

500
00:42:24.585 --> 00:42:25.586
Whoa!

501
00:42:27.022 --> 00:42:28.023
What?

502
00:42:32.027 --> 00:42:33.028
Dyl. what is it?

503
00:43:00.142 --> 00:43:02.449
Dyl. what are you doing?

504
00:43:02.623 --> 00:43:03.624
Come on. Izzy.

505
00:43:23.818 --> 00:43:24.819
Dyl.

506
00:43:28.649 --> 00:43:29.911
Dyl.

507
00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:33.785
Dyl. don't be stupid.
Just put it down.

508
00:43:34.655 --> 00:43:35.874
Shut up.

509
00:43:38.267 --> 00:43:39.704
What the fuck is this place?

510
00:43:47.755 --> 00:43:48.756
Oi.

511
00:43:52.499 --> 00:43:53.543
That's Tom's.

512
00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:55.415
What a freak.

513
00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.940
Camping out here.
Why the fuck would he sleep
outside in the woods?

514
00:44:00.594 --> 00:44:01.769
Probably can't get away
from Mom.

515
00:44:06.252 --> 00:44:09.385
Ooh.
It's like the house of horrors.

516
00:44:09.559 --> 00:44:12.519
That's where he's gonna bury you
after he's killed you.

517
00:44:19.178 --> 00:44:20.396
What? You know what they say.

518
00:44:21.789 --> 00:44:23.922
"Silent one's
are the bloody worst."

519
00:44:24.096 --> 00:44:25.358
Well. Kevin never shut up.

520
00:44:40.895 --> 00:44:41.983
Boo.

521
00:44:44.638 --> 00:44:45.683
I see you found my hideaway.

522
00:44:49.251 --> 00:44:50.252
You're bleeding.

523
00:45:13.449 --> 00:45:14.494
Mom?

524
00:45:15.538 --> 00:45:17.105
Is there a screwdriver
in the caravan?

525
00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:19.368
Uh. yeah. I think I saw
some things under the sink.

526
00:45:19.542 --> 00:45:20.674
Ah.

527
00:45:24.896 --> 00:45:26.898
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

528
00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:29.248
Here. it's yours.

529
00:45:34.949 --> 00:45:37.473
I like it. man.

530
00:45:37.647 --> 00:45:39.475
-And this was here?
-Yeah. we found it in the woods.

531
00:45:39.649 --> 00:45:40.650
We had to drag it down here.

532
00:45:42.348 --> 00:45:43.349
Okay.

533
00:45:43.915 --> 00:45:45.264
Alright. let's flip it.

534
00:45:56.666 --> 00:45:58.016
What do you think?

535
00:46:00.366 --> 00:46:01.541
Could we sail it?

536
00:46:01.715 --> 00:46:02.760
It's hardly a yacht.

537
00:46:04.152 --> 00:46:05.327
Doesn't have to be.

538
00:46:29.743 --> 00:46:31.440
Iz. you know.
when Tom got in the car with us.

539
00:46:31.614 --> 00:46:33.747
I know he had that big rucksack.

540
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.793
Did he have another one
with him?

541
00:46:37.055 --> 00:46:38.447
Do you think he's handsome?

542
00:46:39.753 --> 00:46:40.798
What?

543
00:46:41.886 --> 00:46:42.887
Tom.

544
00:46:43.931 --> 00:46:45.106
Do you think he's handsome?

545
00:46:47.021 --> 00:46:48.762
-Dylan loves him.
-Let's focus. Izzy.

546
00:46:48.936 --> 00:46:51.025
A smaller...
black rucksack.

547
00:46:51.591 --> 00:46:52.766
I don't know. Mom.

548
00:46:55.116 --> 00:46:56.117
I'm not sure about him.

549
00:46:57.336 --> 00:46:58.337
Tom? Why?

550
00:47:01.601 --> 00:47:02.776
He's hiding something.

551
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.824
-Aren't we all?
-Stop talking about that.
please.

552
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:13.482
And I just don't like him
being around. okay?

553
00:47:17.182 --> 00:47:18.792
He might be useful. Iz.

554
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.015
And a bloke around might
make us feel a bit safer.

555
00:47:25.712 --> 00:47:26.844
We are safe.

556
00:47:27.409 --> 00:47:28.410
aren't we?

557
00:47:29.977 --> 00:47:31.022
Yeah.

558
00:47:31.979 --> 00:47:33.763
Yeah. Of course. we are.

559
00:47:40.248 --> 00:47:41.510
I don't want you to bring him
into the caravan.

560
00:47:41.684 --> 00:47:42.729
Oh.

561
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:44.774
Promise?

562
00:47:46.428 --> 00:47:47.473
Fine.

563
00:47:50.606 --> 00:47:51.651
I promise.

564
00:48:02.227 --> 00:48:04.446
Come on. where you're at. Jo?

565
00:48:07.058 --> 00:48:08.363
Fuck. some people.

566
00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:11.062
Ugh.

567
00:48:12.541 --> 00:48:15.718
"My friend says
I should post this pic."

568
00:48:16.545 --> 00:48:17.546
"Opinions?"

569
00:48:19.287 --> 00:48:20.941
Put some fucking
clothes on. love.

570
00:48:24.814 --> 00:48:25.903
Ugh.

571
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.341
If we done this stuff
back in the day.

572
00:48:29.515 --> 00:48:31.386
-it will be like...
-Like what?

573
00:48:31.952 --> 00:48:34.868
Thinking of kidnapping Milan.
Opinions?

574
00:48:36.522 --> 00:48:37.523
Well. you do this. do you?

575
00:48:39.264 --> 00:48:40.787
Put up pictures of yourself
in your undies

576
00:48:40.961 --> 00:48:41.919
and ask people to comment.

577
00:48:42.093 --> 00:48:43.181
Oh. fuck off.

578
00:48:43.355 --> 00:48:44.660
It's for the kids. innit?

579
00:48:44.834 --> 00:48:45.966
It's... My niece is in that.

580
00:48:47.707 --> 00:48:49.361
Kids?

581
00:48:51.624 --> 00:48:52.755
Or Jo's kids?

582
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:58.674
Oh. look.

583
00:49:00.154 --> 00:49:01.199
Two days ago.

584
00:49:05.507 --> 00:49:06.508
Get in.

585
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:25.614
Do you reckon
we could catch a fish?

586
00:49:25.788 --> 00:49:26.789
I don't like fish.

587
00:49:28.008 --> 00:49:29.270
Because I like fish.

588
00:49:29.444 --> 00:49:30.445
It's not all about you.

589
00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.235
Please. stop. Dylan.

590
00:49:38.062 --> 00:49:39.324
-Dyl. please stop.
-Who is it gonna tip?

591
00:49:39.498 --> 00:49:40.847
-Who is it gonna tip?
-It's not funny.

592
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:42.196
-Who is it...?
-It's not funny.

593
00:49:47.332 --> 00:49:48.376
Tom?

594
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:51.423
- What are you doing?
- You're rocking the boat.

595
00:49:52.902 --> 00:49:53.947
Dyl.

596
00:49:54.556 --> 00:49:55.949
Dyl.

597
00:50:00.258 --> 00:50:01.781
Fucking Tom. Dyl.
he's a nutter.

598
00:50:01.955 --> 00:50:03.217
Shut up. Iz.

599
00:50:03.391 --> 00:50:04.653
What. what's he doing?

600
00:50:10.572 --> 00:50:12.444
Dyl. we need to go.
Like we need to get out of here.

601
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.399
You could do with a wash.

602
00:50:55.226 --> 00:50:56.444
What?

603
00:50:59.099 --> 00:51:00.535
-You need a wash.
-Dyl! Dylan!

604
00:51:01.188 --> 00:51:02.755
What have you done?
He can't swim.

605
00:51:05.105 --> 00:51:06.106
Dyl!

606
00:51:08.804 --> 00:51:09.849
Dyl!

607
00:51:25.778 --> 00:51:26.822
Alright.

608
00:51:27.867 --> 00:51:29.477
Okay. Alright.

609
00:51:34.743 --> 00:51:36.615
Here. grab my hand.
Dylan. grab my hand.

610
00:51:37.268 --> 00:51:38.269
Grab my hand.

611
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.666
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

612
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.407
I'm okay. I'm okay.

613
00:51:52.021 --> 00:51:53.371
What the hell is wrong with you!

614
00:51:54.154 --> 00:51:55.199
I'm okay.

615
00:52:06.775 --> 00:52:09.082
I didn't realize
you were so religious.

616
00:52:10.301 --> 00:52:11.432
You believe in God. don't you?

617
00:52:12.346 --> 00:52:14.696
Yeah. all of them.

618
00:52:15.741 --> 00:52:16.785
Why?

619
00:52:19.571 --> 00:52:21.529
The way I see it.
God's a win-win.

620
00:52:21.703 --> 00:52:22.748
Win-win?

621
00:52:23.531 --> 00:52:25.316
If there's no happy ever after.

622
00:52:26.969 --> 00:52:28.971
I'll never need to know.
I can still go out smiling.

623
00:52:30.451 --> 00:52:33.106
I don't think Kevin's
gone out smiling. do you?

624
00:52:36.283 --> 00:52:37.415
Were you and him close?

625
00:52:38.677 --> 00:52:39.634
He's me brother. isn't he?

626
00:52:40.418 --> 00:52:41.767
We don't choose family.

627
00:52:42.768 --> 00:52:43.812
Nah.

628
00:52:46.119 --> 00:52:47.642
He's a fucking nutter.

629
00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:53.126
Never knows when
to fucking shut up or slow down.

630
00:52:56.434 --> 00:52:58.131
Had chances though. our Kevin.

631
00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:00.351
Fucking right.

632
00:53:02.918 --> 00:53:04.920
Got a scholarship
at a private school. didn't he?

633
00:53:06.705 --> 00:53:08.402
What? Is that
where he picked up his habit?

634
00:53:10.361 --> 00:53:11.362
Probably.

635
00:53:15.496 --> 00:53:17.629
Yeah. it was
a real fucking chance. that was.

636
00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:21.241
Of course. he wasted it.

637
00:53:24.244 --> 00:53:25.245
More than I ever had.

638
00:53:27.813 --> 00:53:30.207
So. if you know all that.
why are you out to get Jo?

639
00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.252
He had a lot of money on him.

640
00:53:34.298 --> 00:53:36.038
She's had it. I want it back.

641
00:53:36.865 --> 00:53:38.258
All of this is about cash?

642
00:53:38.432 --> 00:53:40.042
It's all about fucking cash.

643
00:53:42.523 --> 00:53:44.873
Fucking cost me enough already
these days. Look at that.

644
00:53:49.008 --> 00:53:50.227
Fuck's sake.

645
00:54:02.282 --> 00:54:03.457
It's the right place.

646
00:54:04.676 --> 00:54:06.765
There's a hotel up the road.

647
00:54:08.462 --> 00:54:09.550
Now. we wait there

648
00:54:10.116 --> 00:54:11.857
until one of the kids
sends another message.

649
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:14.686
Just ring her
and explain what you want.

650
00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.035
Yeah.
that's a great idea.

651
00:54:17.384 --> 00:54:18.646
Alright. Jo.

652
00:54:19.212 --> 00:54:20.344
Thanks for killing Kev.

653
00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:22.171
Where are you?

654
00:54:23.521 --> 00:54:24.783
Coming right up for a chat.

655
00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.061
What you doing?

656
00:54:56.554 --> 00:54:58.338
I thought you were gonna
drown earlier. too.

657
00:54:58.512 --> 00:54:59.513
Well. I didn't. did I?

658
00:55:01.298 --> 00:55:02.995
Tom is gonna teach me
how to swim anyway.

659
00:55:03.648 --> 00:55:04.692
He's what?

660
00:55:05.258 --> 00:55:06.651
It's not like
I'm scared of the water.

661
00:55:07.129 --> 00:55:08.783
I think
that's a really bad idea.

662
00:55:09.654 --> 00:55:12.352
You should stop bugging him
all the time.

663
00:55:12.526 --> 00:55:14.963
Says you. You can't spend
five minutes on your own.

664
00:55:38.639 --> 00:55:39.727
Do you snore?

665
00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:42.339
No.

666
00:55:43.122 --> 00:55:44.166
I do.

667
00:55:53.959 --> 00:55:54.916
Don't go anywhere.

668
00:57:47.551 --> 00:57:51.032
Everyone with their
fucking heads...

669
00:57:51.206 --> 00:57:54.166
fucking squishes.
stupid. fucking heads off.

670
00:57:55.733 --> 00:57:57.038
I didn't. I didn't. I didn't.

671
00:57:57.212 --> 00:57:59.040
No. No. I did not.

672
00:57:59.214 --> 00:58:01.042
That was a fuckin' movement.
you know?

673
00:58:02.261 --> 00:58:04.089
Don't try to blame me.
Don't you try and blame me.

674
00:58:04.263 --> 00:58:07.048
I swear to fuckin...

675
00:58:07.222 --> 00:58:09.660
All of you trying to fucking
put that blame on me!

676
00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:12.010
I was the only one
who was there.

677
00:58:12.184 --> 00:58:14.926
I was the only one who was there

678
00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:19.104
and you were just watching
and you did nothing to help me.

679
00:58:20.453 --> 00:58:21.889
Judy. fuck off!

680
00:59:39.053 --> 00:59:40.054
Fuck!

681
01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:03.338
Oh. fuck.

682
01:00:03.948 --> 01:00:05.210
Give me the key.

683
01:00:05.384 --> 01:00:06.559
What key?

684
01:00:06.733 --> 01:00:08.082
The key to the room.

685
01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:14.349
Okay.

686
01:00:17.396 --> 01:00:18.702
No.

687
01:00:18.876 --> 01:00:20.007
What do you mean "no"?

688
01:00:21.095 --> 01:00:22.183
I ain't giving it to you.

689
01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:26.927
Then I'll kill you.

690
01:00:30.148 --> 01:00:31.149
Go on then.

691
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:37.111
Oh. go on. Seriously. do it.

692
01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:43.335
I'm so tired.

693
01:00:47.165 --> 01:00:49.123
Jo never said
nothing about no money.

694
01:00:54.433 --> 01:00:56.565
Oh. she wouldn't. would she?

695
01:00:57.479 --> 01:01:00.178
-You need to have
a bit more faith in people.
-Oh. yeah.

696
01:01:02.354 --> 01:01:05.357
Maybe you need to have
a bit less faith in people.

697
01:01:10.188 --> 01:01:13.582
I'll tell you
what I do need. Milan.

698
01:01:18.718 --> 01:01:19.850
More sleep.

699
01:01:25.812 --> 01:01:27.118
How much do you get...

700
01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:30.512
on average?

701
01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:34.516
-Sleep.
-What?

702
01:01:35.213 --> 01:01:38.129
How much you get
on average a night?

703
01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:40.914
I get about...

704
01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:44.701
...about two hours.

705
01:01:46.615 --> 01:01:47.965
Come downstairs.

706
01:01:49.314 --> 01:01:50.750
make a cup of tea.

707
01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:54.232
and I'll talk to the slugs.

708
01:01:56.582 --> 01:01:57.626
Slugs.

709
01:02:00.891 --> 01:02:04.721
Got about seven regulars now.

710
01:02:05.286 --> 01:02:06.331
Regulars.

711
01:02:08.072 --> 01:02:09.464
Little sods...

712
01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:13.294
partying on my floor.

713
01:02:15.993 --> 01:02:17.168
I go back to bed.

714
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:22.913
come back in the morning.
and no sign of them.

715
01:02:25.263 --> 01:02:26.568
Does my fucking head in.

716
01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:28.222
Oh. then you need to sort it.

717
01:02:28.396 --> 01:02:29.397
Yeah. I know.

718
01:02:31.443 --> 01:02:32.966
Got a bloke in. didn't I?

719
01:02:35.534 --> 01:02:37.318
I don't know what he said
I should do.

720
01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:40.191
Said I should get a duck.

721
01:02:42.106 --> 01:02:43.150
A duck.

722
01:02:43.324 --> 01:02:44.499
What? To help you sleep?

723
01:02:44.673 --> 01:02:48.199
No. To eat
the fucking slugs. Ha.

724
01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:51.028
Jesus.

725
01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:54.945
You say I should have
more faith in people.

726
01:02:56.337 --> 01:02:58.078
Alright.
we're gonna stroll in there.

727
01:02:58.252 --> 01:03:02.735
and she's just going to be
counting out the money for us.

728
01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:05.433
-I don't think so.
-Well. what other choice
has she got?

729
01:03:18.098 --> 01:03:22.276
What you think? I'm gonna sleep
with a fucking loaded gun.

730
01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:24.191
stuffed down my pants?

731
01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.542
You dozy fucking mare.

732
01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.068
Go to sleep.

733
01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:34.941
Go to sleep.

734
01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:54.439
You alright. hon?

735
01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:00.575
Why am I in your bed?

736
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:03.448
You got in with me.

737
01:04:03.622 --> 01:04:04.710
You funny thing.

738
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:12.718
Mm-hmm.

739
01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:15.677
-No. Mom.
-Shh.

740
01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.157
I'm just gonna get
some knots out.

741
01:04:17.766 --> 01:04:19.203
-Yeah. but it hurts.
-Shh.

742
01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:20.378
Here.

743
01:04:28.125 --> 01:04:30.649
<i>♪ This is the way</i><i>
We brush our hair ♪</i>

744
01:04:31.128 --> 01:04:33.870
<i>♪ Brush our hair</i><i>
Brush our hair ♪</i>

745
01:04:34.044 --> 01:04:35.523
<i>♪ This is the... ♪</i>

746
01:04:37.003 --> 01:04:38.483
You used to make me sing
that stupid song every day.

747
01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:39.876
or you wouldn't go to nursery.

748
01:04:41.138 --> 01:04:42.139
I want to go home.

749
01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:47.448
It's too soon.

750
01:04:49.842 --> 01:04:51.626
Ow! Hurts.

751
01:04:53.237 --> 01:04:54.978
-Ow! Mom. you never listen.
-Oh. Fine.

752
01:04:55.804 --> 01:04:56.849
Why don't you
get a splash about. yeah?

753
01:04:57.023 --> 01:04:58.155
Dylan's out there with Tom.

754
01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:14.649
- You alright?
- Yeah. this is fine.

755
01:05:14.823 --> 01:05:16.477
Yeah? You...
Can you touch the bottom?

756
01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:17.652
-Yeah. yeah. yeah.
-Yeah?

757
01:05:19.263 --> 01:05:22.657
One. two. three.

758
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:37.585
Look at you. shower.

759
01:05:49.597 --> 01:05:50.990
You dick.

760
01:05:59.868 --> 01:06:00.913
Woo!

761
01:06:48.656 --> 01:06:49.831
Oi. Mom.

762
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.485
-What?
-Oi. watch this.

763
01:07:00.538 --> 01:07:01.539
I can swim!

764
01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:03.280
Woo!

765
01:07:08.981 --> 01:07:10.026
Come on then.

766
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:12.637
Oh. here.

767
01:07:14.595 --> 01:07:15.596
There you go.

768
01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:20.210
Didn't you learn that at school?

769
01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.778
No. The year
I was meant to learn.
the council closed the pool.

770
01:07:23.952 --> 01:07:24.997
Remember?

771
01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:30.002
Oh. well. who cares?
You can swim now.

772
01:07:30.176 --> 01:07:31.438
- Hmm.
- Here.

773
01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:33.092
Is one of those for me?

774
01:07:33.266 --> 01:07:34.267
Oh. yeah.

775
01:07:36.748 --> 01:07:38.619
- Is it chicken or egg?
- -Well. there wasn't much choice.

776
01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:40.795
Mm. okay. so.

777
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:46.366
Yeah. apparently. some kid
got the shit kicked out of him
outside the village shop.

778
01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:49.500
Probably 'cause he ordered tuna
so they beat him up.

779
01:07:49.674 --> 01:07:51.763
No. seriously.
wouldn't expect it around here.

780
01:07:51.937 --> 01:07:53.373
a sleepy little place like this.

781
01:07:53.547 --> 01:07:54.983
What wouldn't you expect?

782
01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:56.811
Some young leg got beaten up
in the village.

783
01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.032
When was that?

784
01:08:00.206 --> 01:08:02.861
Uh. we. um. we should row out

785
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:05.211
to the sound mirrors.

786
01:08:07.561 --> 01:08:09.520
-Will it hold all of us?
-Doubt it.

787
01:08:11.957 --> 01:08:14.307
Don't see why not.
It's not that far.

788
01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:19.530
That's it.

789
01:08:21.575 --> 01:08:22.924
Keep us steady.

790
01:08:23.708 --> 01:08:26.319
Left a bit. Perfect.

791
01:08:29.627 --> 01:08:30.584
Nice one.

792
01:08:31.977 --> 01:08:33.326
So. what are these things then?

793
01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:36.024
It's an early warning system

794
01:08:36.199 --> 01:08:37.461
to pick up the sound
of enemy aircraft.

795
01:08:37.635 --> 01:08:38.853
How would you know?

796
01:08:39.027 --> 01:08:40.551
The book
I was reading last night.

797
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.335
it's got tons of stuff on it.

798
01:08:42.509 --> 01:08:43.989
- Oh. what? You read now?
- Yeah.

799
01:08:44.163 --> 01:08:45.947
You should try it sometime.

800
01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.384
So. they work then?

801
01:08:47.949 --> 01:08:49.125
Kind of.

802
01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:52.258
You could do
with a radar system. Mom.

803
01:08:53.477 --> 01:08:54.478
What's that?

804
01:08:55.043 --> 01:08:56.001
Something that warns you

805
01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:58.046
when a strange man approach.

806
01:10:10.728 --> 01:10:12.469
I hope you're not keeping
that to yourself.

807
01:10:27.048 --> 01:10:28.093
Come on.

808
01:11:06.523 --> 01:11:09.395
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on. Iz.

809
01:11:10.527 --> 01:11:11.528
Come on.

810
01:11:12.137 --> 01:11:13.181
Come on.

811
01:11:14.139 --> 01:11:15.314
Woo-hoo!

812
01:11:15.488 --> 01:11:16.489
Hello.

813
01:11:27.021 --> 01:11:28.806
Hello!

814
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:32.113
Woo-hoo. woo-hoo.
woo-hoo. hello!

815
01:11:35.987 --> 01:11:37.293
Shut the fuck up.

816
01:11:38.946 --> 01:11:40.600
Shut the fuck up!

817
01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.125
Shut up!

818
01:11:59.097 --> 01:12:00.707
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

819
01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:02.622
Izzy. look at me.
Look at mommy.

820
01:12:02.796 --> 01:12:04.668
- It's alright.
- It's alright. Okay?

821
01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:06.670
- It's okay. It's okay.
- It's okay.

822
01:12:06.844 --> 01:12:08.280
Shhh. shhh.

823
01:12:08.454 --> 01:12:11.109
Calm down. It's alright.
Shhh. breathe.

824
01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.200
It's alright. it's alright.
it's okay.

825
01:12:15.374 --> 01:12:17.289
It's okay. it's okay.

826
01:12:18.203 --> 01:12:19.073
It's alright. baby.

827
01:12:32.652 --> 01:12:34.262
You got a fucking worm
or something?

828
01:12:36.613 --> 01:12:38.354
You're a real charmer. Pete.
Do you know that?

829
01:12:59.636 --> 01:13:00.941
Where's the phone. Milan?

830
01:13:04.902 --> 01:13:06.817
I don't know.
You must have left it
back at the hotel.

831
01:13:10.734 --> 01:13:12.388
She messaged you. didn't she?

832
01:13:13.214 --> 01:13:14.694
What. Jo?

833
01:13:15.608 --> 01:13:16.609
She's not stupid.

834
01:13:19.177 --> 01:13:21.092
You fucking liar.

835
01:13:21.266 --> 01:13:24.704
Argh!

836
01:13:24.878 --> 01:13:25.923
Fuck!

837
01:13:33.234 --> 01:13:34.845
Fucking criminal!

838
01:13:38.152 --> 01:13:39.850
You saw that? Huh?

839
01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.244
You see that?

840
01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:46.334
Fuck.

841
01:13:48.859 --> 01:13:51.514
Oh. I'm gonna fucking kill her.

842
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.615
Oh. I know. big boy.

843
01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:08.095
Yeah. fuck off.

844
01:14:09.923 --> 01:14:10.924
You fuck.

845
01:14:19.367 --> 01:14:20.717
You look hot.

846
01:14:42.956 --> 01:14:44.480
You might as well
let me take a look at that.

847
01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:22.256
You know. there's no need
for any of this crazy shit.

848
01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:25.608
We all just need to calm down.

849
01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:53.636
You want some crisps?

850
01:15:55.986 --> 01:15:57.291
-Going to bed.
-Alright.

851
01:16:00.817 --> 01:16:01.905
Well. ask Dylan then.

852
01:16:03.733 --> 01:16:05.343
I'm not taking them into him.

853
01:16:14.004 --> 01:16:15.048
I'll eat them all.

854
01:17:29.253 --> 01:17:30.297
Tom!

855
01:17:36.477 --> 01:17:37.609
Tom. you out here?

856
01:17:47.445 --> 01:17:48.446
I'm bored shitless.

857
01:17:50.274 --> 01:17:51.275
Coming in or what?

858
01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.242
Where are you?

859
01:18:05.506 --> 01:18:06.551
Do you use them...

860
01:18:08.509 --> 01:18:11.034
Do you use them emojis?

861
01:18:14.124 --> 01:18:15.125
Do you?

862
01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:20.304
Neither do I.
Fuck.

863
01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:23.699
Sent.

864
01:18:29.922 --> 01:18:31.141
Yeah...

865
01:18:34.274 --> 01:18:35.885
"In the caravan with Mom."

866
01:18:37.582 --> 01:18:38.931
"Weirdo's still here."

867
01:18:42.587 --> 01:18:44.154
"He's dangerous."

868
01:18:47.679 --> 01:18:49.420
"Scared. Can you come?"

869
01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:52.031
What the fuck?
Give me the phone.

870
01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:14.619
<i>
Um. am I a singer?</i>

871
01:19:15.968 --> 01:19:19.102
No? Okay. Uh...

872
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.497
Uh... I. I. I had someone famous
played me in a movie.

873
01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:25.717
-No... Yes.
-Who?

874
01:19:25.891 --> 01:19:28.764
-Uh. I don't know.
-What?

875
01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:32.593
Well. I can't...
I can't tell them apart.
You can't. can you?

876
01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:35.466
- When they got the little...
- you can't tell who's that. yeah?

877
01:19:36.032 --> 01:19:39.122
- Oh.
- Yes. Hitler.

878
01:19:39.862 --> 01:19:43.082
Oh. my God. you are so crap
at this game.

879
01:19:43.256 --> 01:19:44.867
Yeah. I...

880
01:19:45.389 --> 01:19:48.000
-Sorry. I. I don't
really do games.
-Mm-hmm.

881
01:19:48.827 --> 01:19:49.915
Yeah. well. I like games.

882
01:19:51.743 --> 01:19:55.399
And parties and drinking
on a school night. Woo.

883
01:19:57.531 --> 01:19:59.533
So. does that make me
a bad person?

884
01:20:02.841 --> 01:20:07.759
And yes. I have had my share
of gentleman callers.

885
01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:09.021
I. you know. I...

886
01:20:09.195 --> 01:20:11.545
I never wanted to be a secretary

887
01:20:11.719 --> 01:20:14.461
or a. uh. nice wife
or...

888
01:20:16.768 --> 01:20:17.769
Hmm.

889
01:20:18.378 --> 01:20:19.815
Not that I thought
I'd end up here

890
01:20:20.467 --> 01:20:21.904
like this. Jesus.

891
01:20:26.604 --> 01:20:27.648
Anyway.

892
01:20:30.608 --> 01:20:32.088
Who are you. Mr. Tom?

893
01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:37.615
I'm a secretary.

894
01:20:39.225 --> 01:20:40.139
Seriously?

895
01:20:44.491 --> 01:20:46.363
What are you doing wandering
around the woods on your own

896
01:20:46.537 --> 01:20:47.886
like a mad bastard?

897
01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:54.458
Uh. well. I thought
it would do me good.

898
01:20:55.415 --> 01:20:57.374
To be away from people
for a while.

899
01:20:57.548 --> 01:20:59.028
Oh. God. that's my idea of hell.

900
01:21:01.334 --> 01:21:04.120
Well. I've spent years
being part of a group.

901
01:21:05.904 --> 01:21:11.344
Eating together.
sleeping together.
shitting together. everything.

902
01:21:14.608 --> 01:21:15.609
You've been inside then?

903
01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:22.965
Afghanistan.

904
01:21:26.316 --> 01:21:27.317
Oh.

905
01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:33.279
So how come
you don't see your kid?

906
01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:41.984
I came home different.

907
01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:45.117
Couldn't get my shit together.

908
01:21:45.291 --> 01:21:46.510
Well...

909
01:21:48.599 --> 01:21:50.079
that bit sounds familiar.

910
01:22:15.104 --> 01:22:16.801
-The kids. The kids.
-Oh. sorry.

911
01:22:56.841 --> 01:22:58.451
<i>
So. do you have</i><i>
any battle scars?</i>

912
01:23:01.933 --> 01:23:03.848
Not ones that you can see. No.

913
01:23:06.329 --> 01:23:07.330
I hear things.

914
01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:10.768
see things that aren't there.

915
01:23:13.162 --> 01:23:14.163
and I react.

916
01:23:18.254 --> 01:23:19.646
I had a friend who saw a shrink

917
01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:21.474
because she couldn't stop
shagging people at work.

918
01:23:23.911 --> 01:23:27.263
So there's people you can talk
to about real serious shit.

919
01:23:31.832 --> 01:23:33.095
I have tried. but...

920
01:23:35.097 --> 01:23:38.056
they just want you to revisit
old stuff all the time. and...

921
01:23:39.623 --> 01:23:40.972
I can't.

922
01:23:44.541 --> 01:23:46.804
Well. just because
you're paranoid. doesn't mean
they're not out to get you.

923
01:23:49.807 --> 01:23:51.026
Sorry. It's not helpful.

924
01:23:53.985 --> 01:23:55.160
Is that what Izzy thinks?

925
01:23:57.293 --> 01:23:58.294
Izzy?

926
01:23:59.425 --> 01:24:00.426
Yeah.

927
01:24:01.819 --> 01:24:03.473
She's on her guard.
that's for sure.

928
01:24:08.782 --> 01:24:10.045
I don't wanna talk about Izzy.

929
01:25:17.024 --> 01:25:18.156
You think I'm the mentalist?

930
01:25:19.592 --> 01:25:20.593
What time is it?

931
01:25:21.942 --> 01:25:23.335
Go look in Mom's room.

932
01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:31.126
Oh. my God! Dylan. get out.
Get out of my room!

933
01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.344
Get out! Get out!

934
01:25:32.518 --> 01:25:34.303
She always does this.

935
01:25:35.173 --> 01:25:36.305
You ain't special. you know.

936
01:25:36.479 --> 01:25:37.480
Don't be so fucking rude!

937
01:25:37.654 --> 01:25:39.525
- Go on. Go!
- No.

938
01:25:39.699 --> 01:25:40.874
You do that every time.

939
01:25:41.048 --> 01:25:42.485
Every time.
you doing this thing.

940
01:25:42.659 --> 01:25:44.139
Every time!

941
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:55.585
She probably
only wanted your money.

942
01:25:55.759 --> 01:25:57.804
My money?

943
01:25:58.283 --> 01:25:59.328
You know. the rucksack.

944
01:25:59.806 --> 01:26:01.373
I killed her last boyfriend.

945
01:26:01.547 --> 01:26:02.940
Didn't she tell you that?

946
01:26:05.072 --> 01:26:06.465
I've called for help. Just go!

947
01:26:24.875 --> 01:26:25.919
Pete's here.

948
01:26:27.269 --> 01:26:28.400
Pete's here.

949
01:26:28.574 --> 01:26:31.360
Oh. my God. Dylan. come.

950
01:26:31.534 --> 01:26:32.839
Dylan. come here now.

951
01:26:34.319 --> 01:26:35.581
Oh. my God.

952
01:26:49.465 --> 01:26:50.466
Jo.

953
01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:55.993
Jo. open the door. will you?

954
01:26:57.429 --> 01:26:59.475
- What are you gonna do to us?
- Nothing.

955
01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:02.913
Nothing.
I ain't gonna hurt you. nothing.

956
01:27:07.047 --> 01:27:10.225
Jo. he's not here
to hurt anyone.

957
01:27:10.964 --> 01:27:11.922
Milan?

958
01:27:12.096 --> 01:27:13.489
Yeah. it's me.

959
01:27:13.663 --> 01:27:15.795
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

960
01:27:18.581 --> 01:27:20.974
How did he find us?

961
01:27:21.932 --> 01:27:23.020
It was me.

962
01:27:23.673 --> 01:27:25.370
I told you
not to talk to anyone.

963
01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:28.547
I thought I told you not to let
Tom into the caravan.

964
01:27:29.505 --> 01:27:31.158
- What?
- -You opening the door. or what?

965
01:27:32.508 --> 01:27:34.031
- You won't hurt us?
- No.

966
01:27:34.205 --> 01:27:35.989
He just wants the money. Jo.

967
01:27:38.122 --> 01:27:39.906
Open the fucking door!

968
01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.952
Alright. Alright.
We're coming out.

969
01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:54.878
You alright. Pete?

970
01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:11.460
Where is it?

971
01:28:13.331 --> 01:28:14.854
-The. the rucksack
with the money?
-Yes.

972
01:28:15.028 --> 01:28:16.552
-Is. is that your money?
-Yes.

973
01:28:16.726 --> 01:28:18.641
Ah. yeah.
there was. there was a bag.

974
01:28:18.815 --> 01:28:20.077
but I thought it was Tom's.

975
01:28:20.251 --> 01:28:21.861
It's Kevin and Pete's money.

976
01:28:22.035 --> 01:28:23.863
It wasn't back at the flat.
You must have it. Jo.

977
01:28:24.037 --> 01:28:25.604
No. there isn't
any money. Milan.

978
01:28:25.778 --> 01:28:29.042
You! You're full
of shit. Fuck.

979
01:28:29.216 --> 01:28:30.740
Let's just
find the bag. alright?

980
01:28:31.741 --> 01:28:33.395
- Have you got it. Jo?
- Yeah.

981
01:28:34.352 --> 01:28:36.223
Yeah. there's a bag in the.
in the boot of the car.

982
01:28:36.398 --> 01:28:38.617
Dylan. it's the rucksack
in the boot. It's open. Go on.

983
01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:47.583
It's okay. You're alright.

984
01:28:47.757 --> 01:28:50.760
You're alright. It's alright.
It's okay.

985
01:28:53.937 --> 01:28:55.112
Where is it. Dylan?

986
01:28:56.418 --> 01:28:57.897
I don't know
what anyone's on about.

987
01:28:59.551 --> 01:29:00.552
Oi. you.

988
01:29:01.597 --> 01:29:03.033
Instagram. come here.

989
01:29:03.207 --> 01:29:05.122
- Izzy. don't you move.
- Come here.

990
01:29:05.296 --> 01:29:07.298
No. No.

991
01:29:07.472 --> 01:29:09.082
Come here!

992
01:29:11.041 --> 01:29:12.172
Here.

993
01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.478
Oh. my God.

994
01:29:15.915 --> 01:29:17.177
Pete. please.

995
01:29:19.136 --> 01:29:20.311
Pete. please.

996
01:29:23.836 --> 01:29:24.750
The bag.

997
01:29:24.924 --> 01:29:26.186
Have you got it?

998
01:29:28.624 --> 01:29:29.625
No?

999
01:29:30.887 --> 01:29:31.888
Ain't got it?

1000
01:29:33.498 --> 01:29:34.586
Alright.

1001
01:29:35.195 --> 01:29:36.762
You find our fucking money.

1002
01:29:36.936 --> 01:29:39.069
or I will cut off
her fucking ears.

1003
01:29:39.243 --> 01:29:40.723
Do you understand?

1004
01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:43.813
- It was in the car. I promise you!
- -Do you understand?

1005
01:29:43.987 --> 01:29:46.119
-Pete. she'd tell you
if she knew anything.
-Please.

1006
01:29:49.862 --> 01:29:51.951
Alright. It's alright.
It's alright. Come. Come.

1007
01:29:53.997 --> 01:29:57.261
Fuck.

1008
01:30:00.482 --> 01:30:02.919
Fuck. Fuck.

1009
01:30:04.007 --> 01:30:05.095
Did you take it?

1010
01:30:07.097 --> 01:30:08.664
He would have fucking killed us.

1011
01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:14.452
Now. just give him the money
and both of you just go.

1012
01:30:23.809 --> 01:30:24.810
Fuck.

1013
01:30:47.311 --> 01:30:49.139
You should be giving Jo
some of that damn money

1014
01:30:49.313 --> 01:30:50.749
after what you and your brother
put her through.

1015
01:30:50.923 --> 01:30:52.490
Ah. fuck.

1016
01:30:53.535 --> 01:30:55.014
She killed my brother.

1017
01:30:55.188 --> 01:30:56.799
Oh. he fucking deserved it.

1018
01:30:56.973 --> 01:30:59.410
I killed him.

1019
01:31:02.805 --> 01:31:04.197
He was hurting Mom again

1020
01:31:05.764 --> 01:31:07.026
like he used to hurt me.

1021
01:31:43.236 --> 01:31:46.152
Fuckin'... We don't want
your fucking money.

1022
01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:50.287
You keep your fucking money.

1023
01:31:52.028 --> 01:31:52.985
Fuck.

1024
01:31:59.601 --> 01:32:00.602
Fuck.

1025
01:33:47.970 --> 01:33:51.408
What?
What are you thinking?

1026
01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:57.066
You're only as sick
as your secrets.

1027
01:34:04.551 --> 01:34:05.770
It's over now.

1028
01:34:08.555 --> 01:34:09.600
Is it?

1029
01:34:13.909 --> 01:34:19.131
I have been so careless
with them.

1030
01:35:06.570 --> 01:35:07.745
Mom. stop.
