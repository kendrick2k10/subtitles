00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:31.666
Yeah. it's a shame you missed out on
that first wave of early gentrification.

Oh. I… I really like your glasses.
Those are cool.

676
00:29:15.708 --> 00:29:19.500
Oh. thanks. I actually made them out
of recycled cans of Mountain Dew.

677

Oh. really?

678

Yes. of course!
I said. "to the group." okay?

722
00:31:12.291 --> 00:31:16.333
I literally said. "I'm throwing this out
to the whole group."

723
00:31:16.416 --> 00:31:18.000

816
00:35:15.166 --> 00:35:17.291
It is so nice to meet you guys.

817
00:35:17.375 --> 00:35:19.666
What's going on? Tell me about life.

818
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.708
How are you? How's work?

819
00:35:22.791 --> 00:35:23.958
Talk to me.

820
00:35:24.875 --> 00:35:26.333
Work… Work is fine.

821
00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:28.708
Grinding. I know.

822
00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:32.541
I know. I'm in the grind myself.

823
00:35:33.041 --> 00:35:34.166
[mother chuckles]

824
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.208
So do you hang out
in the hood all the time.

825
00:35:41.291 --> 00:35:43.541
or do you just come up here
for our food and women?

826
00:35:45.625 --> 00:35:46.958
It's a valid question.

827
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.583
- It is.
- [mother] Mm-hmm.

828
00:35:51.208 --> 00:35:55.166
I guess I'm one of those guys
who kind of goes wherever.

829
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:56.541
You go wherever?

830
00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:59.375
Yeah. I'm kind of like a chameleon
in that way. I guess.

831
00:35:59.458 --> 00:36:03.291
You know. I'll pop into Marathon
and grab a hoodie and some socks.

832
00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:07.333
or. you know.
go play ball at Langston Hughes Park

833
00:36:07.416 --> 00:36:08.541
if there's a good run going.

834
00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:10.666
and Roscoe's is obviously one
of my go-to's.

835
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:14.291
I mean. the Carol C. Special. Come on!
Where's our waiter?

836
00:36:14.375 --> 00:36:16.375
I'm gonna go see if the waitperson's here

837
00:36:16.458 --> 00:36:18.875
because I feel like we should get it.

838
00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:21.833
'cause I think you guys
deserve more than this.

839
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.625
This is your white granddaddy
coming back to haunt me.

840
00:36:28.708 --> 00:36:30.750
- What?
- That nigga never liked me.

841
00:36:30.833 --> 00:36:34.041
And it started off by him putting
them strong ass genes in you

842
00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.333
that lighten up the coffee in my babies.

843
00:36:36.416 --> 00:36:38.041
- Akbar. you sound ridiculous.
- Yeah.

844
00:36:38.125 --> 00:36:40.500
And then he planted
a poison pill in my little baby girl

845
00:36:40.583 --> 00:36:44.500
and it has grown into this white boy
that has invited us to lunch at Roscoe's.

846
00:36:44.583 --> 00:36:48.041
Those children got
beautiful cultural experiences

847
00:36:48.125 --> 00:36:50.541
from those moments
with my granddaddy. so please stop.

848
00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:53.833
- What they got was confused. clearly.
- They are not confused.

849
00:36:53.916 --> 00:36:56.291
They are confused.
You don't think this is confusion?

850
00:36:56.375 --> 00:37:00.250
All I'mma tell you is we don't need to be
arguing in front of the white boy. okay?

851
00:37:00.333 --> 00:37:02.708
I'm not gonna change
how I feel about this…

852
00:37:02.791 --> 00:37:04.708
I'm saying what I wanna say.

853
00:37:04.791 --> 00:37:06.833
and I don't give a fuck
about this white boy.

854
00:37:06.916 --> 00:37:08.375
I'm not asking you to do that.

855
00:37:08.458 --> 00:37:09.875
Hey. gang.

856
00:37:09.958 --> 00:37:12.375
[clears throat] I'm back.
I spoke to the waitress.

857
00:37:12.458 --> 00:37:17.250
and she was upset
that I interrupted her smoke break.

858
00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:19.916
Um. so.

859
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.541
you guys are probably
wondering why I asked you to… to lunch.

860
00:37:25.625 --> 00:37:27.333
It crossed my mind.

861
00:37:27.916 --> 00:37:30.791
- Yeah. what the hell is this about?
- [Ezra] Um…

862
00:37:31.541 --> 00:37:34.666
I wanna… I wanna…
I wanna go way back for a second.

863
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.416
I wanna go back to…

864
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.833
Well. let's go with Jesus.

865
00:37:37.916 --> 00:37:40.625
'cause Jesus Christ
was half Black. half Jewish. right?

866
00:37:40.708 --> 00:37:42.958
Let's start with Jesus. Legend. right? So…

867
00:37:43.583 --> 00:37:48.416
Jesus Christ. technically.
I imagine. had mixed-race children.

868
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:53.083
which I think is… is great because
mixed-race people are really awesome.

869
00:37:53.166 --> 00:37:55.458
You know. you have.
like. Mariah and Derek Jeter.

870
00:37:55.541 --> 00:37:58.291
and then. of course.
you have the GOAT. He was mixed race.

871
00:37:59.458 --> 00:38:00.291
The GOAT?

872
00:38:00.875 --> 00:38:02.083
The Greatest of All Time.

873
00:38:02.166 --> 00:38:04.791
Yeah. I know what it means.
but who are you referring to?

874
00:38:05.375 --> 00:38:08.083
Our guy. the legend. Malcolm X.

875
00:38:08.166 --> 00:38:10.250
<i>- Our </i>guy?
- [Akbar laughs]

876
00:38:10.333 --> 00:38:13.791
- Not-- the GOAT. Not… Not my guy. Mr. X.
- [mother laughs]

877
00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:16.708
And I'm saying that. like. he's mixed race

878
00:38:16.791 --> 00:38:20.583
and then if Amira and I had a kid.
that kid would be mixed race.

879
00:38:20.666 --> 00:38:22.708
and it would be a very nice baby.

880
00:38:22.791 --> 00:38:26.875
Maybe not as important
as Malcolm X. but maybe. Maybe!

881
00:38:26.958 --> 00:38:29.583
Maybe my son would be
as important as Malcolm X.

882
00:38:29.666 --> 00:38:31.083
I don't know 'cause I haven't--

883
00:38:31.791 --> 00:38:34.708
And she's not pregnant.
She's not pregnant.

884
00:38:34.791 --> 00:38:38.625
Because we don't even do that much stuff

885
00:38:38.708 --> 00:38:40.333
and when we do.

886
00:38:40.416 --> 00:38:43.125
I… I am careful.

887
00:38:43.208 --> 00:38:44.541
And she's not a prude.

888
00:38:44.625 --> 00:38:47.791
She's gr-- really.
she knows her way around it.

889
00:38:47.875 --> 00:38:50.416
- Okay.
- What I'm saying is I love your daughter!

890
00:38:51.166 --> 00:38:54.875
I… I love her.
and I would make a good husband.

891
00:38:57.791 --> 00:38:59.583
What in the mother of--

892
00:38:59.666 --> 00:39:01.166
I know I quoted <i>Forrest Gump.</i>

893
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.041
Yeah. you know what?
I did quote <i>Forrest Gump.</i>

894
00:39:03.125 --> 00:39:06.416
Because you know who
Forrest's best friend was in the world?

895
00:39:06.958 --> 00:39:07.833
Bubba.

896
00:39:08.416 --> 00:39:11.291
- What?
- And was Bubba Black and Forrest white?

897
00:39:12.541 --> 00:39:14.458
You bet your fucking ass they were.

898
00:39:14.541 --> 00:39:17.333
And… And you know what?
It wasn't about race.

899
00:39:17.958 --> 00:39:21.416
It was about shrimp and partnership.
and they made it work.

900
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.208
And Amira and I have done
a lot of the similar stuff

901
00:39:24.291 --> 00:39:27.458
that Bubba and Forrest did together.
and now we're here.

902
00:39:27.541 --> 00:39:30.375
and I just wanna marry your daughter.
if that's okay.

903
00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:38.875
We never seen no fucking <i>Forrest Gump.</i>

904
00:39:38.958 --> 00:39:40.833
[inhales]

905
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:44.416
- Ain't this about a bitch?
- [exhales]

906
00:39:45.666 --> 00:39:48.833
So it's not bad enough
that y'all make me have to get a vaccine

907
00:39:48.916 --> 00:39:50.458
so I can go into the casino.

908
00:39:50.541 --> 00:39:53.416
- Now y'all coming after my kids?
- [mother groans]

909
00:39:54.583 --> 00:39:56.333
So you wanna marry my daughter?

910
00:39:58.791 --> 00:40:00.208
Yes. Yes. I do.

911
00:40:03.541 --> 00:40:04.541
Well. Ezra…

912
00:40:08.333 --> 00:40:09.708
you can try.

913
00:40:12.833 --> 00:40:15.208
- [knock on door]
- No. that's him right now. Mama.

914
00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:17.625
- Oh. okay. I'll call you back.
- [phone beeps]

915
00:40:22.875 --> 00:40:24.208
Hey. what's up?

916
00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:26.208
I just got off the phone with my mom.

917
00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:31.291
Oh. you… you did?
Yeah. what… what did she have to say?

918
00:40:31.375 --> 00:40:32.375
About…

919
00:40:33.041 --> 00:40:36.708
Well. she just told me
that you took her and my dad out to lunch.

920
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:39.666
It was a nightmare. okay?
I totally blacked out. I fucked up.

921
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.375
I have no idea. I don't remember anything.

922
00:40:41.458 --> 00:40:44.583
Well. lucky for you.
my parents remember everything.

923
00:40:45.083 --> 00:40:47.791
Why would you take my parents
to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles

924
00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:49.208
and without asking me?

925
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:54.416
I was taking a shot at something. okay?
Just forget it.

926
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.500
Forget it?
Oh. no. please. Ezra. keep going.

927
00:40:56.583 --> 00:40:59.500
'cause I would love to know
about this little brilliant plan of yours.

928
00:40:59.583 --> 00:41:03.458
[exhales] You wouldn't understand. okay?

929
00:41:04.833 --> 00:41:05.958
[sighs]

930
00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:06.916
Oh. my God.

931
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.500
- [Ezra] I was gonna take your parents out…
- Wait. oh. my God.

932
00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:11.708
- We were gonna have a great time.
- Oh. my God.

933
00:41:11.791 --> 00:41:13.833
And then I was gonna ask their blessing.

934
00:41:13.916 --> 00:41:16.041
and I had this
whole cute proposal planned.

935
00:41:16.125 --> 00:41:18.916
where I was gonna reenact our first
few dates. but then it got messed up.

936
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.458
- No. it's not messed up. It's not.
- No. it is. 'cause your dad--

937
00:41:21.541 --> 00:41:23.458
- No. it's not. Ezra! Ezra!
- Like. it's ruined.

938
00:41:23.541 --> 00:41:25.791
- What?
- You can still go through with it.

939
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.333
When?

940
00:41:29.416 --> 00:41:30.791
- Now! Right now!
- Like now?

941
00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:32.541
Yes. right now.

942
00:41:34.708 --> 00:41:36.041
- Right--
- Hurry up!

943
00:41:36.125 --> 00:41:39.083
Okay. I'm gonna
take off my shoe so I don't crease it.

944
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:44.875
Amira… [exhales]

945
00:41:47.083 --> 00:41:48.625
- I love you so much.
- Hmm.

946
00:41:49.833 --> 00:41:53.583
I have never felt so understood
by somebody in my entire life.

947
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.958
I am blown away by your beauty

948
00:41:57.666 --> 00:41:59.625
and your intelligence and your grace.

949
00:41:59.708 --> 00:42:00.916
[Amira sighs]

950
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.125
And now you just do whatever you wanna do.

951
00:42:04.833 --> 00:42:06.000
And if you let me.

952
00:42:06.958 --> 00:42:10.208
I will do everything in my power
to give you the most beautiful life.

953
00:42:10.791 --> 00:42:14.000
filled with love and laughter and joy.

954
00:42:17.083 --> 00:42:18.833
Amira. will you marry me?

955
00:42:20.291 --> 00:42:21.708
Of course.

956
00:42:21.791 --> 00:42:22.791
You will?

957
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.291
- [Amira chuckles] Yes!
- Oh. my God.

958
00:42:28.333 --> 00:42:30.166
[exhales]

959
00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:32.458
Oh! Oh. my God!

960
00:42:32.541 --> 00:42:35.166
It's from the Holocaust.
so that's why it's small.

961
00:42:35.833 --> 00:42:37.583
- [Amira] Oh. I love you.
- I love you.

962
00:42:38.375 --> 00:42:39.958
[Amira] I need some color. look.

963
00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:42.583
Sorry it's so small.

964
00:42:42.666 --> 00:42:44.333
No. it's beautiful.

965
00:42:45.666 --> 00:42:48.541
So what's the story again?
It's your grandmother's?

966
00:42:48.625 --> 00:42:51.166
Yeah. it's my grandmother's. It was her--

967
00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.250
She got it in the Holocaust or whatever.

968
00:42:54.125 --> 00:42:58.083
But like. how old is she
if it's from the Holocaust?

969
00:42:58.708 --> 00:43:00.083
It's been a minute. I don't know.

970
00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:03.041
I think she got engaged when
she was. like. three or four years old.

971
00:43:03.125 --> 00:43:04.875
[laughing]

972
00:43:04.958 --> 00:43:07.583
- It was a different time. you know.
- So stupid.

973
00:43:07.666 --> 00:43:11.083
- It was a different…
- What is wrong with you? [laughing]

974
00:43:11.166 --> 00:43:13.583
[chattering]

975
00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:16.833
[Amira laughing]

976
00:43:19.875 --> 00:43:22.333
[Ezra] Don. known you my whole life.

977
00:43:22.416 --> 00:43:24.208
You've been an incredible boss.

978
00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:25.291
I grew up with your kids.

979
00:43:25.375 --> 00:43:28.083
Been on family vacations together.
You've always looked out for me.

980
00:43:28.166 --> 00:43:30.166
- Mm-hmm.
- Been like a father to me.

981
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:33.125
And working for you these past ten years
has been life-changing.

982
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.125
But it's time for a new adventure.

983
00:43:37.416 --> 00:43:39.750
That's it? That was great!

984
00:43:39.833 --> 00:43:42.833
- That was really good.
- An adventure in podcasting.

985
00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:47.083
Uh. maybe leave the podcast part out.

986
00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:48.125
I'm gonna throw up.

987
00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:50.250
No. wait. no. no. no.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen.

988
00:43:50.333 --> 00:43:54.125
- Dude. I'm… [sighs]
- Listen. Listen to me though. Relax.

989
00:43:54.208 --> 00:43:56.666
You're doing the right thing.
You just gotta do it.

990
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:59.208
You understand? You got the juice!

991
00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:02.250
Repeat that. "I got the juice."

992
00:44:02.333 --> 00:44:03.166
I got the juice.

993
00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:05.041
- I got the juice.
- I got the juice.

994
00:44:05.125 --> 00:44:06.666
Say it with some nuts. I got the juice.

995
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.375
- I got the juice!
- Believe in yourself!

996
00:44:08.458 --> 00:44:10.750
- I got the juice!
- I'm not a buster. I got the juice.

997
00:44:10.833 --> 00:44:13.416
I'm not a mark-ass buster like Don.
I got the juice. bitch!

998
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.875
- Period.
- Period!

999
00:44:14.958 --> 00:44:17.541
Okay. Now. when you get home.
we're gonna watch <i>Juice.</i>

1000
00:44:17.625 --> 00:44:20.083
because I'm sure Shelley
didn't let you watch <i>Juice</i> growing up.

1001
00:44:20.666 --> 00:44:21.791
That is so disrespectful.

1002
00:44:21.875 --> 00:44:23.708
- Is it?
- I've seen <i>Juice </i>more than you.

1003
00:44:23.791 --> 00:44:25.875
- Ooh! [laughs]
- I love you.

1004
00:44:25.958 --> 00:44:28.458
- I love you. You got this. okay?
- Thank you. All right.

1005
00:44:28.541 --> 00:44:32.000
Come on. Don! You little bitch-ass Don!

1006
00:44:32.083 --> 00:44:33.541
I'm coming for you. Don!

1007
00:44:33.625 --> 00:44:34.958
- Okay.
- [Ezra] Come on!

1008
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:37.291
- [hip-hop music playing]
<i>- ♪ Insane… ♪</i>

1009
00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.833
[Don] I do not care. Javier.

1010
00:44:40.916 --> 00:44:43.375
- [exhales]
- [Don] Just get it!

1011
00:44:43.458 --> 00:44:45.125
<i>♪ I'm just in pain… ♪</i>

1012
00:44:45.208 --> 00:44:47.791
I don't give a rat's ass. okay?
How about that?

1013
00:44:47.875 --> 00:44:51.958
My Maserati sounds like
it got gangbanged by the Toronto Raptors.

1014
00:44:52.041 --> 00:44:53.125
so fix it!

1015
00:44:53.958 --> 00:44:54.916
Jesus!

1016
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:56.583
What's up?

1017
00:44:58.541 --> 00:45:00.208
- Cars. huh?
- [Don sighs]

1018
00:45:01.875 --> 00:45:02.708
Yeah.

1019
00:45:03.291 --> 00:45:04.375
[Ezra] Mm-hmm.

1020
00:45:05.875 --> 00:45:06.958
On… On that.

1021
00:45:07.041 --> 00:45:09.333
Um… [sighs]

1022
00:45:09.416 --> 00:45:11.125
I. uh. I don't…

1023
00:45:12.375 --> 00:45:13.500
I don't think I'm gonna--

1024
00:45:13.583 --> 00:45:16.333
I think I'm gonna
not come to work at this address…

1025
00:45:16.416 --> 00:45:17.416
- What?
- …anymore.

1026
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.750
What are you talking about?

1027
00:45:19.833 --> 00:45:22.583
[splutters] At a different address.
I'm gonna work--

1028
00:45:22.666 --> 00:45:26.333
I'm not gonna work here at this address.
so I'm gonna. like. do a different place

1029
00:45:26.416 --> 00:45:29.041
that I'm gonna do the work from
that's different work.

1030
00:45:29.958 --> 00:45:31.833
Are you trying to quit on me?

1031
00:45:31.916 --> 00:45:33.333
Yeah. Goodbye.

1032
00:45:34.833 --> 00:45:38.458
Pathetic. Who resigns in Helvetica?

1033
00:45:38.541 --> 00:45:40.500
Wait. so you said. "Fuck you. Don"?

1034
00:45:41.416 --> 00:45:42.333
Pretty much.

1035
00:45:42.416 --> 00:45:43.375
What did he say?

1036
00:45:43.458 --> 00:45:47.083
He was like. "You're a great guy.
And like. I'm sorry that--"

1037
00:45:47.166 --> 00:45:49.916
"Like. I wish I did better
in a weird way too."

1038
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.833
And I was like. "It's all good.
but also like. don't…"

1039
00:45:53.916 --> 00:45:55.000
- Period.
- You know. period.

1040
00:45:55.083 --> 00:45:56.083
Oh. I love that.

1041
00:45:56.166 --> 00:45:58.625
- To the juice.
- To the juice!

1042
00:45:58.708 --> 00:46:01.416
[Ezra] Mm. Mm. Mmm!

1043
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.333
All right.

1044
00:46:03.041 --> 00:46:05.958
Let's talk wedding before I think
too hard about what I actually just did.

1045
00:46:06.041 --> 00:46:09.291
[inhales] Um. sure.

1046
00:46:10.208 --> 00:46:13.375
Huh. That's a super reassuring response.

1047
00:46:13.458 --> 00:46:14.875
No. babe. I'm sorry.

1048
00:46:14.958 --> 00:46:17.833
Look. you know
I love you to death. I really do.

1049
00:46:18.458 --> 00:46:19.333
Uh-oh.

1050
00:46:20.833 --> 00:46:22.458
I'm just a little worried.

1051
00:46:22.541 --> 00:46:26.625
You know. since we got engaged
and got the house. my family.

1052
00:46:26.708 --> 00:46:29.458
they've just been on my head
and not in a good way.

1053
00:46:29.541 --> 00:46:30.375
So they hate me.

1054
00:46:30.458 --> 00:46:32.333
- No! No. no. they don't.
- Your family hates me.

1055
00:46:32.416 --> 00:46:35.458
They just don't know you yet. you know.
And I think…

1056
00:46:35.541 --> 00:46:38.541
Look. this is gonna take
some getting used to for them.

1057
00:46:39.083 --> 00:46:41.708
I mean. and can you honestly say
that your family's excited

1058
00:46:41.791 --> 00:46:43.625
to have my Black ass in the picture?

1059
00:46:44.708 --> 00:46:46.875
I think a good portion of them are.

1060
00:46:46.958 --> 00:46:47.833
For sure.

1061
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:50.833
[sighs] All right.

1062
00:46:51.541 --> 00:46:53.041
Let me think about this.

1063
00:46:55.625 --> 00:46:56.791
[Amira sighs]

1064
00:46:56.875 --> 00:47:00.541
From where I'm sitting.
I think there's only one thing left to do.

1065
00:47:02.666 --> 00:47:06.708
[Shelley] I mean. there are just
so many primary colors in this space.

1066
00:47:06.791 --> 00:47:10.125
- Which is very uplifting.
- [Arnold] Alive.

1067
00:47:10.208 --> 00:47:11.791
It really is.

1068
00:47:11.875 --> 00:47:15.291
- And we are so thrilled about this.
- [mother] Mm.

1069
00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:18.291
- Mm!
- [Shelley] I mean. they're just precious.

1070
00:47:18.375 --> 00:47:19.333
[laughing]

1071
00:47:19.416 --> 00:47:23.500
So have you cuties
made any. uh. wedding plans yet?

1072
00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:26.041
You know. we've thrown some ideas around.

1073
00:47:26.125 --> 00:47:29.041
Yeah. we're thinking something
really small and intimate

1074
00:47:29.125 --> 00:47:30.833
that really just represents us.

1075
00:47:30.916 --> 00:47:31.833
[Shelley] Uh-huh.

1076
00:47:31.916 --> 00:47:34.875
But we should probably talk about
who's gonna officiate the wedding.

1077
00:47:34.958 --> 00:47:37.125
Oh. Arnold already talked to Rabbi Singer.

1078
00:47:37.208 --> 00:47:38.083
Singer is in!

1079
00:47:38.166 --> 00:47:40.083
[Shelley] Yeah. he'd be honored.

1080
00:47:40.166 --> 00:47:41.750
Rabbi Singer.

1081
00:47:42.458 --> 00:47:44.958
- [mother] Hmm.
- So you're not gonna go with an imam?

1082
00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:47.250
- [Amira hesitates] Um…
- Who's Auntie Mom?

1083
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.333
- There's no Auntie Mom. It's an "imam."
- Imam.

1084
00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:52.833
Mm. I'm so sorry.
Can you spell that for me?

1085
00:47:52.916 --> 00:47:55.458
I'll spell it for you later.
It's like a rabbi for Muslim people.

1086
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:56.708
- Thank you. Ezra.
- [Arnold] Oh.

1087
00:47:56.791 --> 00:47:58.958
- [mother chuckles]
- Oh. so you're all Muslim?

1088
00:47:59.041 --> 00:48:00.916
- Yes.
- Oh. yes. very much so.

1089
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.500
I love it.

1090
00:48:02.583 --> 00:48:03.916
That's why I wear this crown.

1091
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.708
I love your crown. It's gorgeous.

1092
00:48:06.791 --> 00:48:10.500
Babe. you wanna. um.
tell them the story behind that crown?

1093
00:48:10.583 --> 00:48:13.041
Well. this kufi that I'm wearing right now

1094
00:48:13.125 --> 00:48:15.875
was actually a gift
from the honorable Louis Farrakhan.

1095
00:48:17.083 --> 00:48:19.750
Mmm! Love Farrakhan.

1096
00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.166
You… You love Farrakhan?

1097
00:48:24.625 --> 00:48:26.250
Love him. Can't get enough.

1098
00:48:26.333 --> 00:48:29.416
He's… He's one of the GOATs.
He's another one of the GOATs.

1099
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:33.125
- Really? What do you love about Farrakhan?
- Yeah. what do you love about Farrakhan?

1100
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:37.208
Probably the same stuff that you do.
just more stuff.

1101
00:48:38.041 --> 00:48:39.000
[Shelley. mother] Hmm.

1102
00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:40.958
Can you be a bit more specific?

1103
00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:43.083
Yeah. um.

1104
00:48:43.708 --> 00:48:47.958
I think what I love about him
is his general vibe.

1105
00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:51.666
- [Akbar] Ah.
- He's got kind of a no-frills attitude.

1106
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:56.708
And I just think he tells it
like it's gotta be told sometimes.

1107
00:48:56.791 --> 00:48:58.166
- Just stop. babe.
- For sure. yeah.

1108
00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:01.208
[mother] Ooh! Oh. babe.
maybe you should finish telling them

1109
00:49:01.291 --> 00:49:03.500
about our private dinner
with the minister.

1110
00:49:03.583 --> 00:49:07.583
Oh. well. we were blessed
to be in Brother Minister's company.

1111
00:49:07.666 --> 00:49:10.916
and. uh. I got to speak with him
for maybe. like. an hour or so.

1112
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.958
- Oh.
- [Akbar] We talked about everything.

1113
00:49:13.041 --> 00:49:15.750
How far we've come
and how far we have to go as a people.

1114
00:49:15.833 --> 00:49:16.666
No kidding.

1115
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:19.500
And at the end of the conversation.
he actually took this kufi off

1116
00:49:19.583 --> 00:49:21.041
and put it on my head.

1117
00:49:21.125 --> 00:49:23.750
So this is one of my most treasured gifts.

1118
00:49:23.833 --> 00:49:25.083
- Isn't that incredible?
- Yes.

1119
00:49:25.166 --> 00:49:27.291
Are you familiar with.
um. the minister's work?

1120
00:49:28.333 --> 00:49:31.416
Well. I'm familiar
with what he said about the Jews.

1121
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.375
Let's have dinner.

1122
00:49:32.458 --> 00:49:34.666
- Yeah.
- I am fucking-- so fucking hungry.

1123
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:36.916
Let's get up and do it. Whoo!

1124
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:40.666
I found this great
new Sirius station on the radio.

1125
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:43.208
- It's '90s West Coast bangers.
- Hey!

1126
00:49:43.291 --> 00:49:45.208
It has all the stuff.

1127
00:49:45.291 --> 00:49:48.083
Yeah. Dad. I see you
driving down Xzibit highway.

1128
00:49:48.166 --> 00:49:51.500
and let's refocus it
to this dinner that Amira made.

1129
00:49:51.583 --> 00:49:52.875
because she's a genius.

1130
00:49:52.958 --> 00:49:56.166
- [chuckles] Okay. well. let's dig in.
- All right.

1131
00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.666
So wait. wait. wait. wait.
We're not gonna say grace first?

1132
00:49:59.625 --> 00:50:01.041
- [Ezra] No. I mean. yeah.
- Yeah.

1133
00:50:01.125 --> 00:50:02.250
Oh. I was gonna say grace.

1134
00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:05.500
- I mean. we say grace all the time. so…
- All the time.

1135
00:50:05.583 --> 00:50:07.375
[Ezra] Muslim style.
so because you're here.

1136
00:50:07.458 --> 00:50:10.083
maybe out of respect.
you would wanna lead.

1137
00:50:10.166 --> 00:50:12.458
- [mother] Mm-hmm.
- Well. I will do the honors.

1138
00:50:14.375 --> 00:50:15.666
- [exhales]
- [silverware clatters]

1139
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:16.958
[Shelley] Oh.

1140
00:50:18.125 --> 00:50:22.125
[Akbar] All praises be to Allah.
who fed us and provided us with drink…

1141
00:50:22.208 --> 00:50:23.291
[whispers] Close your eyes.

1142
00:50:23.375 --> 00:50:25.166
[Akbar] …and made us
from among the Muslims.

1143
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:26.833
All praises be to Allah.

1144
00:50:26.916 --> 00:50:29.208
who fed me this and provided it for me

1145
00:50:29.291 --> 00:50:31.250
without any power or might from myself.

1146
00:50:31.333 --> 00:50:34.625
- Correct.
- [Akbar speaking Arabic]

1147
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:37.750
- <i>Amin.</i>
- [Ezra] Definitely.

1148
00:50:37.833 --> 00:50:39.250
<i>- Amin.</i>
- Amen.

1149
00:50:39.333 --> 00:50:41.625
- [all] <i>Amin.</i>
- [Shelley splutters]

1150
00:50:41.708 --> 00:50:43.333
I couldn't have said it better myself.

1151
00:50:43.958 --> 00:50:47.333
So. Ezra tells me that you guys
used to have a boat growing up.

1152
00:50:47.416 --> 00:50:48.416
[Shelley] Yeah.

1153
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.791
I was thinking that maybe one day

1154
00:50:49.875 --> 00:50:52.291
we can rent a boat and go out.

1155
00:50:52.375 --> 00:50:53.416
- Hang out.
- [Arnold] Oh.

1156
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:54.958
- All of us.
- That would be really fun.

1157
00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:56.916
- I can make that happen.
- We'll think about it.

1158
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.833
Because Black folks don't really
have a good relationship with boats.

1159
00:50:59.916 --> 00:51:02.333
[laughing] That's very true. Or water.

1160
00:51:02.416 --> 00:51:05.541
[chuckling] Kind of like Jews
with trains. right?

1161
00:51:05.625 --> 00:51:07.208
- [Arnold] Wow. Bingo.
- [Shelley] Hmm.

1162
00:51:07.291 --> 00:51:08.791
[laughing]

1163
00:51:08.875 --> 00:51:12.291
[scoffs] Are you trying
to compare the Holocaust to slavery?

1164
00:51:13.958 --> 00:51:17.083
Oh. no. no. no. no. I'm not doing--
I mean. I wouldn't do that.

1165
00:51:20.458 --> 00:51:23.500
Al… Although.
you know. if you think about it.

1166
00:51:23.583 --> 00:51:27.625
I think the Blacks and the Jews
have a similar struggle.

1167
00:51:27.708 --> 00:51:28.916
- [Arnold] Hmm.
- [Shelley] Yeah.

1168
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.916
No. So you are kind of sort of
comparing the two.

1169
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.041
- Just a little bit.
- Can you pass the potatoes this way. hmm?

1170
00:51:34.125 --> 00:51:38.791
Well. the Jews were technically
the original slaves.

1171
00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:41.666
- Right? OG slaves.
- [Shelley] Oh. that's interesting.

1172
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:43.666
Oh. you going all the way back to Egypt.

1173
00:51:44.333 --> 00:51:47.041
Okay. well. you do know that
that was 3.500 years ago.

1174
00:51:47.125 --> 00:51:50.250
Slavery is one
great-grandparent away for us.

1175
00:51:50.333 --> 00:51:52.625
- That is correct.
- You know. My grandmother picked cotton.

1176
00:51:52.708 --> 00:51:54.708
Well. Daddy.
I don't think that they were trying--

1177
00:51:54.791 --> 00:51:56.958
- No. it's true. honey.
- My grandmother picked cotton.

1178
00:51:57.041 --> 00:52:00.208
I don't have to go back to Egypt.
I just go back 75 years.

1179
00:52:00.291 --> 00:52:03.583
You know. Jews make up one-half of 1%
of the world's population.

1180
00:52:03.666 --> 00:52:05.708
because we were
systematically annihilated.

1181
00:52:05.791 --> 00:52:06.666
Exactly.

1182
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:09.750
The one and one-half percent
of the population that you make up

1183
00:52:09.833 --> 00:52:12.291
seems to be doing pretty good right now.

1184
00:52:14.041 --> 00:52:17.916
Uh. yeah. okay. but… [chuckles]

1185
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.583
Here's the thing.
It's not like we don't work hard for it.

1186
00:52:22.666 --> 00:52:27.166
You know? I mean Arnold.
he works super-duper hard in his practice.

1187
00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:30.625
- He's a podiatrist. You do. honey.
- And… And what did his father do?

1188
00:52:31.208 --> 00:52:32.166
He was a podiatrist.

1189
00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:33.541
And what about his father?

1190
00:52:33.625 --> 00:52:36.333
He was a… a podiatrist.

1191
00:52:36.416 --> 00:52:37.875
- Yeah. so…
- [Arnold] Well.

1192
00:52:37.958 --> 00:52:40.791
- And a bookie.
- Yes. he did that on the side.

1193
00:52:40.875 --> 00:52:42.041
He went straight.

1194
00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:44.083
[Shelley] All I'm saying
is that our people

1195
00:52:44.166 --> 00:52:46.833
came here with nothing
like everybody else.

1196
00:52:46.916 --> 00:52:50.083
Actually. you kind of sort of came here

1197
00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:53.083
with the money that you made
from the slave trade.

1198
00:52:53.166 --> 00:52:54.541
- What? Oh!
- [Akbar] Preach.

1199
00:52:54.625 --> 00:52:56.708
- Preach. Mother. Preach. Mother.
- [Arnold] Holy moly.

1200
00:52:56.791 --> 00:52:58.333
- Come on.
- It's true. It's very tr--

1201
00:52:58.416 --> 00:53:01.208
- I would like to see your sources on that.
- Baby. go get my purse.

1202
00:53:01.291 --> 00:53:03.125
I've got my slave receipts in my purse.

1203
00:53:03.208 --> 00:53:05.916
- Go get my purse.
- [Akbar] Take that off the table.

1204
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.250
I don't turn on the news every day
and see people in yarmulkes getting shot

1205
00:53:10.333 --> 00:53:12.458
by police because they was out
minding their business.

1206
00:53:12.541 --> 00:53:15.833
Okay. first of all. you have no idea
what you're talking about.

1207
00:53:15.916 --> 00:53:17.875
- A very uncomfortable conversation.
- [chattering]

1208
00:53:17.958 --> 00:53:20.583
Ever figure out what happened
with the potatoes? An ETA on those?

1209
00:53:20.666 --> 00:53:21.500
I'm trying.

1210
00:53:21.583 --> 00:53:22.416
[mother sneezes]

1211
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:23.583
Are you okay?

1212
00:53:23.666 --> 00:53:26.541
I think we need to blow the candles out.
I'm getting an allergic reaction.

1213
00:53:26.625 --> 00:53:28.208
Babe. can you move the candles?

1214
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:30.000
- Yes.
- Can you get these candles out of here?

1215
00:53:30.083 --> 00:53:31.708
- [Shelley] Yes.
- Candles smell like shit.

1216
00:53:31.791 --> 00:53:33.833
- [chattering]
- No. it's okay. I got it.

1217
00:53:33.916 --> 00:53:37.416
When my grandmother was picking cotton.
your grandfather's picking feet.

1218
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.583
Yes. I agree.

1219
00:53:38.666 --> 00:53:40.666
[Ezra] I just want you to sit down.
I am hosting.

1220
00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:43.250
- [chattering]
- No. no. There they go!

1221
00:53:43.333 --> 00:53:44.833
I am supposed--

1222
00:53:44.916 --> 00:53:47.666
- Oh. shit! Oh. shit!
- [screaming]

1223
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.750
- Oh. shit!
- [Ezra] Oh. shit!

1224
00:53:49.833 --> 00:53:52.458
- Grab some water or something!
- [Akbar] Oh. shit! What the fuck!

1225
00:53:52.541 --> 00:53:54.416
What are you doing? Hey! No!

1226
00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:57.125
- [shouting]
- No! No!

1227
00:53:57.208 --> 00:54:00.541
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry! Oh. my God.

1228
00:54:00.625 --> 00:54:01.750
[gasps]

1229
00:54:01.833 --> 00:54:03.000
[mother] Oh. Lord.

1230
00:54:03.083 --> 00:54:04.208
Oh. shit.

1231
00:54:05.791 --> 00:54:06.625
[Amira sighs]

1232
00:54:09.041 --> 00:54:10.666
What are we gonna do?

1233
00:54:11.333 --> 00:54:14.708
- About the kufi? It's gone. baby.
- No. our parents.

1234
00:54:15.333 --> 00:54:16.541
Who cares?

1235
00:54:16.625 --> 00:54:19.375
Like. we don't even have to
worry about that.

1236
00:54:19.458 --> 00:54:22.041
I mean. your dad's intense. yeah.
but we knew that going in.

1237
00:54:22.916 --> 00:54:24.500
What is that supposed to mean?

1238
00:54:25.458 --> 00:54:28.208
Guess it's supposed to mean that
he didn't smile or make one joke--

1239
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:31.125
Oh. wow. Are you trying to say
that my dad's an angry Black man?

1240
00:54:31.208 --> 00:54:32.791
I never said he was angry. no.

1241
00:54:32.875 --> 00:54:35.708
Yeah. but you're saying
a Black man is intense.

1242
00:54:35.791 --> 00:54:37.625
which is insinuating that he is.

1243
00:54:37.708 --> 00:54:40.333
He is Black. and he's intense.

1244
00:54:40.416 --> 00:54:43.833
Yeah. but you don't say that
as a white person about a Black person.

1245
00:54:43.916 --> 00:54:45.791
calling them "aggressive" or "intense."

1246
00:54:45.875 --> 00:54:48.833
That's being passive-aggressive
saying that he's an angry Black man.

1247
00:54:48.916 --> 00:54:51.500
- Should I say he's not intense?
- Say nothing about my dad.

1248
00:54:51.583 --> 00:54:53.708
If anyone should have any beef.
it's with your mom.

1249
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:55.541
She set my dad's kufi on fire.

1250
00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:58.500
What's wrong with my mom?
I mean. yeah. she's. like. an idiot.

1251
00:54:58.583 --> 00:54:59.916
but she still. like. means well.

1252
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.708
It's not like she did it on purpose.

1253
00:55:01.791 --> 00:55:03.875
Mm. Yeah. I don't know about that.

1254
00:55:05.125 --> 00:55:08.750
All right. I'm not gonna argue
about something so ridiculous. okay?

1255
00:55:08.833 --> 00:55:11.000
[sighs] All right.
let's talk about the rabbi.

1256
00:55:11.083 --> 00:55:14.458
I don't think we need that.
Let's just have a friend of ours do it.

1257
00:55:14.541 --> 00:55:16.958
[inhales] Um.
I would like to use our imam.

1258
00:55:18.333 --> 00:55:19.208
Your imam?

1259
00:55:19.291 --> 00:55:20.666
[Amira] Mm-hmm.

1260
00:55:21.541 --> 00:55:24.333
Okay. Miss Shakur.
When did you get so Muslim?

1261
00:55:24.416 --> 00:55:25.958
I've been Muslim. I was born Muslim.

1262
00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:28.708
And it's important to my dad.
so I think we should go with it.

1263
00:55:28.791 --> 00:55:30.541
Was that Muslim bacon you ate yesterday?

1264
00:55:30.625 --> 00:55:32.583
It actually was. It was Jewish bacon.

1265
00:55:32.666 --> 00:55:33.583
- Jewish bacon?
- Yeah.

1266
00:55:33.666 --> 00:55:35.208
- I don't claim to be super Jewish.
- Okay.

1267
00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:37.875
- I eat bacon all day. I don't care.
- Okay. Well. so what? And?

1268
00:55:37.958 --> 00:55:39.500
- Yeah. you want an imam to marry us.
- So?

1269
00:55:39.583 --> 00:55:41.166
Want me to face the bed towards Mecca?

1270
00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:43.208
- I can do that.
- Actually. I do. Very much so.

1271
00:55:43.291 --> 00:55:46.125
Okay. cool. I love that four hours ago
you became a devout Muslim.

1272
00:55:46.208 --> 00:55:48.500
- For sure.
- Your dad's not even that Muslim!

1273
00:55:48.583 --> 00:55:51.416
He heard "Fight the Power" once
and changed his name from Woody to Akbar.

1274
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.041
Okay. now you're
going all out of line. Relax.

1275
00:55:54.125 --> 00:55:56.125
- You told me that. We joke about it.
- Yeah.

1276
00:55:56.208 --> 00:55:58.583
But I didn't tell you that
for you to turn around and tell me.

1277
00:55:58.666 --> 00:56:01.625
You're being-- Really. low-key.
you're being an asshole.

1278
00:56:02.333 --> 00:56:05.041
- I'm being an asshole?
- Yes.

1279
00:56:06.791 --> 00:56:08.208
- [Ezra] Okay.
- [exhales]

1280
00:56:10.583 --> 00:56:14.166
You know what?
I really-- I don't wanna fight. I can't.

1281
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:16.666
I don't wanna fight about it. okay?

1282
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:19.666
We just had too much
going on tonight. I just… I can't.

1283
00:56:20.375 --> 00:56:22.708
Me either.
I don't wanna fight about it either.

1284
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:24.708
[exhales]

1285
00:56:25.291 --> 00:56:28.500
[inhales] Look.
I think our time would be best used

1286
00:56:28.583 --> 00:56:31.166
if we just think about how
to move forward.

1287
00:56:31.916 --> 00:56:32.916
I agree.

1288
00:56:34.458 --> 00:56:37.208
I'm gonna pitch that we just never speak
to these people ever again

1289
00:56:37.291 --> 00:56:39.250
and just a full. clean break.

1290
00:56:40.583 --> 00:56:42.166
We cannot do that.

1291
00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:48.041
You know. I'm thinking that maybe
if we spend more time with them together.

1292
00:56:48.125 --> 00:56:51.375
maybe you and my dad can kind of hang out.
just you and him.

1293
00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:54.166
Sounds rad.

1294
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:56.416
Then I think he can get comfortable
with you. you know.

1295
00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.791
And then maybe he'll see
what we have going on.

1296
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:03.250
Just might make him feel. you know…
and you too.

1297
00:57:04.833 --> 00:57:06.958
- Okay.
- Okay.

1298
00:57:08.083 --> 00:57:09.541
- [sighs]
- Okay.

- I like that.

1616
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:53.916
- I don't.
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. brother. there we are.

1617
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.375
[Shelley] A little clarity.

1618
01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:58.791
Do you mean that everybody
wears the same suit to the wedding?

1619
01:11:58.875 --> 01:12:01.625
Nah. you pick your color.
but you gotta get in where you fit in.

1620
01:12:01.708 --> 01:12:02.791
First come. first serve.

1621
01:12:02.875 --> 01:12:04.375
I want a red-- I want a red one.

1622
01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:06.833
You want the red one?
We got that. So the red is gone.

1623
01:12:06.916 --> 01:12:08.416
[Shelley] Where do we get the suits?

1624
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:09.708
Oh. I'll bring the suits. yeah.

1625
01:12:09.791 --> 01:12:12.458
I'll bring the suits.
I got 40 hood <i>Tron</i> suits.

1626
01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:14.208
and. uh. they light up.

1627
01:12:14.291 --> 01:12:16.458
- All of 'em work. It's gonna be great.
- [Akbar] Mm.

1628
01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.875
- And you have 40 of them?
- Forty of 'em.

1629
01:12:18.958 --> 01:12:21.666
Anybody outside of y'all wedding.
more than 40 people.

1630
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:23.083
then that's on y'all.

1631
01:12:23.166 --> 01:12:26.083
I wouldn't bring them
'cause they couldn't fit in the suit.

1632
01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:28.833
They gonna look weird
without being in a suit.

1633
01:12:28.916 --> 01:12:31.333
- It'll be cool. brother. There you go.
- That sounds different.

- [Demetrius] Ain't nobody did that.

I know.

1637
01:12:37.833 --> 01:12:41.416
The good news is
we are almost done with it.

1638
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.583
And they've been so busy.
they're basically out of our lives.

1639
01:12:44.666 --> 01:12:46.708
You're right.
I haven't heard from my mom in days.

1640
01:12:46.791 --> 01:12:47.958
It's been amazing.

1641
01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:50.750
Yeah. I haven't heard
from my dad either. which is rare.

1642
01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:54.833
because he hasn't even sent one
of his "form follows function" texts.

1643
01:12:55.625 --> 01:12:57.708
Do you think
something terrible happened to him?

1644
01:12:57.791 --> 01:13:00.166
Oh. my God. no. Why would you say that?

1645
01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:01.875
No. I-- that would be horrible.

1646
01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:07.416
That would be the worst.
I'm just making sure he's okay.

1647
01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.500
Anyway. babe. I gotta go.

1648
01:13:09.583 --> 01:13:11.708
- I don't wanna be late. Kiss.
- You look beautiful.

1649
01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:13.416
Thank you.

1650
01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.416
You're gonna kill it.
Remember. you got the juice.

1651
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.291
You really
haven't seen that movie. have you?

1652
01:13:18.375 --> 01:13:20.708
If you fucking say
I haven't seen <i>Juice</i> one more time.

1653
01:13:20.791 --> 01:13:22.083

[Amira laughs]

1655
01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:28.041
That's why with the Victorian dress.
I went with the blues and the greens.

1656
01:13:28.125 --> 01:13:30.291
A very rich color for this time.

1657
01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:33.333
And just so you guys know. I have
really great relationships downtown.

1658
01:13:33.416 --> 01:13:36.625
and I can get high-quality fabrics
for. like. a fraction of the cost.

1659
01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:38.250
- This is great.
- Yeah.

1660
01:13:38.333 --> 01:13:40.458
I would love to leave you guys
with some of my sketches.

1661

Man. And can you remind me
when you graduated Harvard?

1663
01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:46.000
It's just maybe we know the same people.

1664

Oh. um.

I went to Howard.

and you just snitch on him
to your daughter?

No. we gonna just go down there

Hey. let me get this straight.

1782
01:18:57.166 --> 01:19:00.250
Every single person that you know
does coke. but you don't?

1783
01:19:02.083 --> 01:19:04.166
Yeah. it's crazy and upsetting.

1784
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:07.625
It's… It's driving us apart. honestly.

1785
01:19:08.416 --> 01:19:11.708
I miss them the way they were. you know.

Yo! Ezra!
Ezra. buddy. buddy. We're almost out.

1787
01:19:15.958 --> 01:19:19.541
So we need your guy's number.
So we need to call the coke guy.

1788
01:19:19.625 --> 01:19:22.750
Your guy. your coke guy.
Can we call him? Thank you.

1789
01:19:22.833 --> 01:19:25.583
What guy? I don't have a guy!

1790
01:19:25.666 --> 01:19:27.625
Ez. what? You definitely have a guy.

1791
01:19:27.708 --> 01:19:30.250
- You got a guy.
- The coke guy from Vegas from last time.

1792
01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:31.750
Just call him. Quit holding out.

1793
01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.875
I think you're so high on cocaine.
you don't know what you're saying.

1794
01:19:34.958 --> 01:19:38.791
I don't have a coke guy.

1795
01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:40.166
- [laughing]
- No. You have a guy.

1796
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:41.708
We bought cocaine from him.

1797
01:19:41.791 --> 01:19:43.875
- He is a cocaine dealer.
- [man 2] Yeah.

1798
01:19:43.958 --> 01:19:45.375
And we bought coke.

1799
01:19:45.458 --> 01:19:48.958
and you got so high that
you ended up passing out on the Strip.

1800
01:19:49.041 --> 01:19:50.750
You had cocaine all over your face.

1801
01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:52.916
Wait. I think I remember you.

1802
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.333
You… You shit your pants last time.

1803

- Yes. you did! You shit your pants!
- [all laughing]

1804
01:19:58.541 --> 01:20:01.041
- From cocaine use! You did that.
- [mouths] Shut the fuck up.

Sniff. sniff. motherfuckers.

The coke guy!

1809
01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:14.458
Look. Look. look at his knuckles.

1810
01:20:14.541 --> 01:20:16.875
Yeah. it says "Coke Guy"
right there on his knuckles.

1811
01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:20.416
Ezra! Thank you for
the Edible Arrangement on my birthday.

1812

Yeah.

1815
01:20:32.583 --> 01:20:35.625
Hey. you shit on yourself
last time you was here?

1816

You shat your slacks?

1817
01:20:38.916 --> 01:20:41.041
Yes. but not from cocaine.

1818
01:20:41.125 --> 01:20:44.333
It was from… It was from Chipotle.

Okay. you said plural. so there's an "s."

- [Amira] I guess you could say that.

1856
01:22:08.583 --> 01:22:10.208
[exhales] Yeah. mine was rough.

1857
01:22:11.625 --> 01:22:13.125
Did your dad say anything?

1858
01:22:13.708 --> 01:22:15.625
No. Why? Should he?

1859

No. just that. uh. everything went okay.

1860
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.750
and it was totally normal. so. yeah.

1861
01:22:23.375 --> 01:22:25.958
- Okay.
- Why was yours rough? 'Cause my mom?

1862
01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:28.375
[Amira sighs] I don't wanna talk about it.

1863
01:22:28.458 --> 01:22:29.916
[scoffs] What'd she do this time?

1864
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.750
Ezra. I don't--
I really don't wanna talk about it.

1865
01:22:32.833 --> 01:22:34.291
Just tell me what she did.

1866
01:22:35.208 --> 01:22:39.625
[sighs] Okay. she pulled the same
tone-deaf shit she does all the time.

1867
01:22:39.708 --> 01:22:41.708
But that's what y'all do. so…

1868
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.416
What type of shit is that to say?

1869
01:22:46.583 --> 01:22:48.583
I'm sorry. I just got a lot on my mind.

1870
01:22:49.125 --> 01:22:50.125
I'm sorry.

[Ezra sighs] Okay.

1872
01:22:56.625 --> 01:22:58.666
Whoa. whoa. What are you doing?

1873
01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:01.541
- Throwing this shit away.
- Why?

1874
01:23:01.625 --> 01:23:04.166
Because I didn't get the job. Ezra.
That's why.

1875
01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:05.875
What?

1876
01:23:05.958 --> 01:23:09.583
The producer called me and told me
that he went with someone else.

1877
01:23:09.666 --> 01:23:12.750
Someone who has more
period piece experience. I don't know.

1878
01:23:14.208 --> 01:23:15.250
[Ezra] Baby. I'm sorry.

1879
01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:19.500
If it's any consolation.
I can hold you down for a while.

1880
01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:22.916
[scoffs] No. Ezra.
I don't wanna be some kept woman.

1881
01:23:24.916 --> 01:23:28.166
I'm just trying to think
of ways to help you. all right?

1882
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:30.666
Like… [sighs]

1883
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:31.750
- Let me--
- [Amira sighs]

1884
01:23:31.833 --> 01:23:34.000
Let me call
my family friend Rick Greenwald.

1885
01:23:34.083 --> 01:23:35.125
He's got connections.

1886
01:23:35.208 --> 01:23:37.083
and he'll look out
for you on your next job.

1887
01:23:37.166 --> 01:23:38.708
Oh. the fucking luxury.

1888
01:23:39.291 --> 01:23:42.041
Are you not listening to what I'm saying?
Are you not hearing me?

1889
01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:43.875
Everything I have. I've gotten on my own.

1890
01:23:43.958 --> 01:23:45.708
I've worked really hard for it

1891
01:23:45.791 --> 01:23:48.000
and worked through
all this racist bullshit.

1892
01:23:48.083 --> 01:23:49.416
all for you to be able to come in

1893
01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.041
and call your family friend
to give me a job

1894
01:23:52.125 --> 01:23:54.291
I probably should have got five years ago?

1895
01:23:54.375 --> 01:23:56.041
How do you think that makes me feel?

1896
01:23:56.916 --> 01:24:00.083
Well. I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
I'm just trying to. like. help.

1897
01:24:00.166 --> 01:24:02.750
And it's okay to accept help
from someone who loves you.

1898
01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:07.541
That's really easy for you to say because
that's how life has worked for you.

1899
01:24:07.625 --> 01:24:09.083
That's not how it works for me.

1900
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:12.125
Whatever. We have to get ready
for this rehearsal dinner.

1901
01:24:12.208 --> 01:24:14.208
I'm going to the bathroom. Alone.

1902

Please.

1903
01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:19.583
Yeah. I don't wanna go
to the bathroom with you.

1904

1905

My charger's in there though.

1906
01:24:24.416 --> 01:24:27.041

It was a peeping Tom charge. okay?

1924
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:25.791
I was looking in there. peeping to see
if my baby mama was cheating.

1925
01:25:25.875 --> 01:25:29.000
so I could get lower prices
on my child support.

1926
01:25:29.083 --> 01:25:30.375
Why peep through the window?

1927
01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:34.458
Because I wanted to see somebody
have her broke down over. like a shotgun.

That ain't gonna lower your child support.

my child support will go low.

- Ezra.

1938
01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.750

- This is my uncle.

1939
01:25:59.833 --> 01:26:00.708
[EJ] Okay.

1940
01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:03.125
Yeah. this is Ezra. This is the man.

1941
01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:05.375
- My man. all right.
- [Akbar exhales]

1942
01:26:05.458 --> 01:26:08.208
Okay. I'm gonna go say what's up to Renee.

1943
01:26:08.291 --> 01:26:09.458
- [EJ] Yeah.
- Y'all be nice.

1944
01:26:09.541 --> 01:26:10.625
We'll be nice to Ezra.

1945
01:26:10.708 --> 01:26:13.416
You gonna let this credit card sit here.
we gonna swipe him.

[Amira laughs]

1947
01:26:14.416 --> 01:26:17.375
He look like an AmEx.
standing here with his hair slicked back.

1948
01:26:17.458 --> 01:26:19.333
- Oh. He lying.
- [chuckling]

1949
01:26:19.416 --> 01:26:20.958
- [laughs] All right.
- All right. Okay.

1950
01:26:21.041 --> 01:26:22.708
Come back soon if you want.

1951
01:26:22.791 --> 01:26:26.625
- Ezra does a podcast on Black culture.
- Oh!

1952
01:26:27.875 --> 01:26:28.958
Tell him. Ezra.

1953
01:26:29.041 --> 01:26:30.458
Yeah. I do podcasts.

1954
01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:32.250
About what?

1955
01:26:32.958 --> 01:26:33.875
The culture.

1956
01:26:34.458 --> 01:26:36.708
Oh. you're gonna just say "culture"
and leave "Black" out?

1957
01:26:37.291 --> 01:26:40.458
[EJ laughs] You gotta get that money
some kind of way. baby. huh?

1958
01:26:40.541 --> 01:26:43.916
Give me $150 real quick.
Don't tell her I asked for the money.

1959
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.791
- I won't. I'll Venmo--
- Give me a Cîroc.

And. uh. the white Barry White

Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey!
I got something to say.

1968
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.375
- I got something to say. Uh…
- [man] Okay. say it!

1969

This is nice. y'all. This is real nice.

1970
01:27:11.250 --> 01:27:14.583
I ain't never had
no. uh. wedding like this.

1971
01:27:14.666 --> 01:27:17.125
but I mean. I've been married three times.
That's right.

1972
01:27:17.208 --> 01:27:19.125
Two times at the courthouse

1973
01:27:19.208 --> 01:27:21.916
and then one time
at the Benihana's. [chuckles]

1974
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.083
We ain't had no reservations.
nothing like that.

1975
01:27:24.166 --> 01:27:28.125
Amira. my cousin. I just wanna say
how happy I am for you and Ezra--

1976
01:27:28.208 --> 01:27:31.833
Girl. we just wanna say congrats.
You marrying this white man.

- Girl. all these white people are here.
- [scoffs]

1978
01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:37.375
If you like it. we love it.
right? [chuckles]

1979
01:27:37.458 --> 01:27:40.000
- I stormed the Capitol.
- [crowd gasps]

1980
01:27:40.083 --> 01:27:42.416
I did. I was there.

1981
01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:45.208
Ezra tried to stop me.

1982
01:27:47.166 --> 01:27:49.375
He's a liberal cuck. but he's a good man.

1983
01:27:49.458 --> 01:27:52.791
To my best friend Ezra.
who's kind and thoughtful.

1984
01:27:53.375 --> 01:27:56.666
but for whatever reason didn't think
to sit me on the Black side of the table.

1985
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:59.791
which just aesthetically
makes sense. you know.

1986
01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:04.208
Cheers to inclusion
and our newly found generational wealth.

1987
01:28:04.291 --> 01:28:06.916
"He left the family early. um.

1988
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.958
leaving his mother responsible

I wanna say it was Albuquerque.

- Okay. I think we can wrap it up. Yeah.
- I think.

That vaccine…

1995
01:28:31.083 --> 01:28:32.666
makes you gay.

1996
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:34.541
So the moral of the story is

1997
01:28:34.625 --> 01:28:37.458
never date a woman
who don't respect your wife.

1998

2001

Can I have everybody's attention. please?

2002
01:28:55.166 --> 01:28:56.375
Attention. everyone.

2003
01:28:57.125 --> 01:28:58.625
Yeah. I know it's. uh.

2004
01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:01.791
it's customary for the father
to give a speech on the wedding day.

2005
01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:06.458
But I thought there was some things
that I needed to. uh. address tonight.

2006
01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:08.583
Um.

2007
01:29:09.083 --> 01:29:10.833
when a man's daughter gets married.

2008
01:29:11.916 --> 01:29:14.500
they say that the man is giving her away.

2009
01:29:15.541 --> 01:29:18.375
Now. that's a really hard pill to swallow.

2010
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.000
Because you don't usually know

2011
01:29:21.083 --> 01:29:23.958
who the man is
that you're giving your daughter away to.

2012
01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:25.916
Usually.

2013
01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:29.291
But I consider myself fortunate.

2014
01:29:29.375 --> 01:29:32.500
because I think
I kind of do know who Ezra is.

Oh. Ezra.

Thank you for.
uh. what you did back there.

2031
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.583
What did I do back there?

2032
01:30:38.416 --> 01:30:39.333
Your speech.

2033
01:30:39.416 --> 01:30:42.416
You could've. uh.
could've blown up my spot.

2034
01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:43.958
You didn't. so thanks.

2035
01:30:44.041 --> 01:30:47.166
Well. save your thank you.
'cause I didn't do it for you.

2036
01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:48.958
I did that for my daughter.

2037
01:30:49.041 --> 01:30:51.791
You think I'm gonna embarrass her
in front of her whole family?

2038
01:30:52.458 --> 01:30:53.375
No.

2039
01:30:55.291 --> 01:30:56.708
You don't know me too well.

2040
01:30:58.291 --> 01:31:00.791
But here's the thing. I know you.

2041
01:31:01.916 --> 01:31:03.750
I've known you from the very start.

2042
01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:05.750
I had your number from day one.

2043
01:31:06.875 --> 01:31:07.875
And for the life of me.

2044
01:31:07.958 --> 01:31:11.458
I do not know why my daughter
continues to go down this path with you.

2045
01:31:12.041 --> 01:31:14.208
There's one thing
that I'm crystal clear on.

2046
01:31:14.291 --> 01:31:20.666
is that you are absolutely.
positively. unequivocally

2047
01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.958
not the right the guy for my daughter.

2048
01:31:24.583 --> 01:31:25.583
Period.

2049
01:31:25.666 --> 01:31:27.750
- Why?
- Excuse me.

2050
01:31:27.833 --> 01:31:29.958
Why am I not
the right guy for your daughter?

2051
01:31:30.041 --> 01:31:31.791
Well. shit. where do I begin?

2052
01:31:31.875 --> 01:31:32.708
Anywhere.

2053
01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:36.708
Well. what… what about
we start at your bachelor party?

2054
01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:39.250
When I saw you in the room
with the strippers and the cocaine.

2055
01:31:39.333 --> 01:31:40.750
how about we start there?

2056
01:31:40.833 --> 01:31:41.916
Why don't we start with

2057
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.250
why you were at my bachelor party
in the first place?

2058
01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:46.166
You had no right to be there.

2059
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:47.958
Bachelor parties are
for people to be weird.

2060
01:31:48.041 --> 01:31:49.500
That's not who I am.

2061
01:31:49.583 --> 01:31:51.416
Okay? It's my dumb fucking friends.

2062
01:31:52.041 --> 01:31:54.375
But you deeboed your way in.
and you got what you wanted.

2063
01:31:54.458 --> 01:31:55.916
I had a shitty time.

2064
01:31:56.708 --> 01:32:00.500
As a matter of fact. I have a shitty time
whenever you're around.

2065
01:32:00.583 --> 01:32:03.500
You're like the cooler to my life.
and I don't know why.

2066
01:32:04.083 --> 01:32:07.125
Because the truth is all I've ever done

2067
01:32:08.541 --> 01:32:10.041
is love your daughter.

2068
01:32:10.583 --> 01:32:12.708
wholly and completely.

2069
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.083
And she loves me.

2070
01:32:15.166 --> 01:32:17.083
and we wanna marry each other.

2071
01:32:17.166 --> 01:32:20.208
And you just decided
before you even met me

2072
01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:21.791
that you hated me.

2073
01:32:22.416 --> 01:32:24.625
[scoffs] And then once you met me.
you put all your energy

2074
01:32:24.708 --> 01:32:26.958
just towards. like. smoking me out

2075
01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:29.500
or trying to prove
I don't belong around Black people.

2076
01:32:29.583 --> 01:32:32.041
or that I'm a researcher
and not a witness.

2077
01:32:32.666 --> 01:32:35.583
That's why you brought me
to play ball at that park.

2078
01:32:35.666 --> 01:32:37.291
Why you brought me to that Crip barbershop

2079
01:32:37.375 --> 01:32:39.208
while I'm wearing a red hoodie
like an idiot.

2080
01:32:39.291 --> 01:32:43.125
It's why you fuck with me about my podcast
and my music taste and how I talk

2081
01:32:43.208 --> 01:32:44.916
and how I think and who my friends are

2082
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.125
and basically
everything that I'm a part of.

2083
01:32:48.166 --> 01:32:50.333
And I just take it. I take it!

2084
01:32:50.416 --> 01:32:52.833
I take your shit. I take it all day.

2085
01:32:53.833 --> 01:32:56.541
And it did teach me one thing
that you were right about.

2086
01:32:56.625 --> 01:32:57.583
[Akbar] And what's that?

2087
01:32:58.166 --> 01:33:02.166
I will never. ever. ever

2088
01:33:03.291 --> 01:33:06.125
know what it's like
to be a Black person in this country.

2089
01:33:07.333 --> 01:33:09.500
But I do know what an asshole is.

2090
01:33:17.875 --> 01:33:19.291
Yeah. yeah. I know.

2091
01:33:19.375 --> 01:33:22.666
I'm really pleased with the way--
and they're such a nice group of--

2092
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:26.083
Oh. Amira! Amira. Hi!

2093
01:33:26.166 --> 01:33:28.083
Would you excuse me for just a second?

2094
01:33:28.166 --> 01:33:30.083
- Oh. my gosh!
- [Amira] Hi.

2095
01:33:30.166 --> 01:33:32.500
Hi! I just wanted to stop you

2096
01:33:32.583 --> 01:33:34.583
and tell you
that I think you look so pretty.

2097
01:33:34.666 --> 01:33:35.750
Thank you.

2098
01:33:36.333 --> 01:33:37.625
Is that a roller set?

2099
01:33:37.708 --> 01:33:40.666
- Hmm?
- Your hair. Is it a roller set?

2100
01:33:41.583 --> 01:33:43.666
Um. no. it's not.

2101
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:48.708
Oh. Shoot. Okay.
It's not individuals. right?

2102
01:33:48.791 --> 01:33:49.750
[Amira] No.

2103
01:33:49.833 --> 01:33:52.291
No? Okay. Shit.

2104
01:33:52.375 --> 01:33:55.416
All right. well. I guess I'm gonna
have to go back to the drawing board.

2105
01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.000
I. uh-- Ever since the bachelorette party…

2106
01:33:58.083 --> 01:33:58.916
[Amira] Mm-hmm.

2107
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.708
…I just did this really deep dive
on Black women's hair.

2108
01:34:02.791 --> 01:34:06.583
And. um. oh. for example.
I watched the Chris Rock documentary.

2109
01:34:06.666 --> 01:34:10.041
I don't know if you've had a chance
to see it. It's absolutely fantastic.

2110
01:34:10.125 --> 01:34:11.458
And he's so funny.

2111
01:34:11.541 --> 01:34:13.916
There's something about his voice
that always makes me laugh.

2112
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.916
But anyway. there's nothing funny
about Black women's hair. you know.

2113
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.833
I mean. my God. I just had no idea.

2114
01:34:20.916 --> 01:34:22.875
I mean. it really blew my mind.

2115
01:34:22.958 --> 01:34:25.458
You know. the energy and the time

2116
01:34:25.541 --> 01:34:29.750
and the… the pain and the suffering
that Black women go through.

2117
01:34:29.833 --> 01:34:33.000
And so. anyway.
I just wanted to be well-versed

2118
01:34:33.083 --> 01:34:36.125
for when I saw you next.
and I'll let you get back to it.

2119
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:39.333
Yeah. and-- but before you go.
can you just tell me…

2120
01:34:39.958 --> 01:34:42.666
[exhales] What is this style?
Just so I know for next time.

2121
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:44.833
- Shelley. I'm not a toy.
- [Shelley] Because I--

2122
01:34:45.583 --> 01:34:46.500
Hmm?

2123
01:34:46.583 --> 01:34:49.500
I really don't appreciate you treating me

2124
01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:53.083
like some shiny little object
you can show off to your friends.

2125
01:34:53.166 --> 01:34:54.916
Oh. no.
I would never do anything like that.

2126
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.083
- [Amira] No. you are.
- No--

2127
01:34:56.166 --> 01:34:58.750
- [Amira] Just let me finish. Yes. you do.
- Oh. no. I--

2128
01:34:58.833 --> 01:35:02.458
Since I met you.
I've been nothing but kind and respectful.

2129
01:35:02.541 --> 01:35:03.791
And it's starting to feel like

2130
01:35:03.875 --> 01:35:06.416
you're all happy
that you have this Black daughter-in-law

2131
01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:09.041
now that it's cool
to care about Black people.

2132
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.083
I bet every time we hang out.
you tell one of your friends.

2133
01:35:13.166 --> 01:35:15.666
and I can guarantee you
that what you don't tell them

2134
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:17.250
is that every time we hang out.

2135
01:35:17.333 --> 01:35:21.875
you are wildly offensive
and incredibly inappropriate.

2136
01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:25.583
- Well. I'm not--
- [Amira] Oh. and now you're gonna cry.

2137
01:35:25.666 --> 01:35:27.708
You're gonna clutch your pearls
and play the victim

2138
01:35:27.791 --> 01:35:30.083
as if everything I just said.
none of that was valid.

2139
01:35:30.166 --> 01:35:31.875
My feelings are not valid.

2140
01:35:31.958 --> 01:35:33.291
Your feelings are hurt.

2141
01:35:33.375 --> 01:35:35.250
- Am I being too aggressive with you?
- [splutters]

2142
01:35:35.333 --> 01:35:37.000
[Amira] Am I giving you "angry"?

2143
01:35:38.083 --> 01:35:41.708
The crazy thing is that I really
genuinely wanted to get to know you.

2144
01:35:41.791 --> 01:35:42.750
woman to woman.

2145
01:35:42.833 --> 01:35:44.250
I thought you would see me.

2146
01:35:44.333 --> 01:35:46.833
- That's what I--
- [Amira] No. it's not.

2147
01:35:47.375 --> 01:35:49.625
Because you can't just see me for me.

2148
01:35:50.125 --> 01:35:51.708
It doesn't matter how many books you read

2149
01:35:51.791 --> 01:35:54.333
or how many documentaries that you watch.

2150
01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:57.750
because at the end of the day.
I won't just be Amira to you.

2151
01:35:57.833 --> 01:36:01.041
I'll always be Amira.
the Black token daughter-in-law.

2152
01:36:01.125 --> 01:36:02.541
and that's ignorant.

2153
01:36:03.375 --> 01:36:05.125
Amira. are you okay?

2154
01:36:05.208 --> 01:36:06.041
Not really.

2155
01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.500
- Miss Shelley. are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

2156
01:36:10.125 --> 01:36:13.250
All right. Uh. Amira. honey.

2157
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:17.666
[sniffles]

2158
01:36:21.833 --> 01:36:23.583
[both] Can I talk to you for a second?

2159
01:36:23.666 --> 01:36:24.583
Yes.

2160
01:36:28.958 --> 01:36:30.375
[gasps] You wanna go first?

2161
01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:34.958
- I do. but it sounds like you do too.
- I do. [exhales]

2162
01:36:38.625 --> 01:36:39.625
Ezra…

2163
01:36:44.166 --> 01:36:46.916
I don't know how this is gonna work.

2164
01:36:49.541 --> 01:36:50.375
Okay.

2165
01:36:51.291 --> 01:36:52.375
[Amira] It's just…

2166
01:36:53.583 --> 01:36:56.208
You know. your family.

2167
01:36:56.291 --> 01:36:59.166
my family. the whole thing.

2168
01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:02.958
I don't know
if it's supposed to be this hard.

2169
01:37:03.041 --> 01:37:05.291
and if I'm being honest. I just…

2170
01:37:06.208 --> 01:37:08.416
Oh. God. I don't have it in me.

2171
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.416
I'm so sorry.

2172

[Ezra sighs]

2173
01:37:21.875 --> 01:37:23.500
Uh. I don't disagree.

2174

my mom. your dad.

2176
01:37:33.833 --> 01:37:36.375
Yeah. I guess I don't see it changing. so…

2177
01:37:40.083 --> 01:37:43.250
I do. uh. I do want you to know that.

2178
01:37:44.375 --> 01:37:48.500
uh. this time with you has been.
like. the happiest time of my life. so…

2179
01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:57.583
I feel the same way. [sobs]

2180
01:38:07.375 --> 01:38:08.375

that's been profoundly
rattling around in your consciousness?
