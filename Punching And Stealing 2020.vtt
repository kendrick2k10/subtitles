And he's like. "how can you tell what
somebody looks like over the phone?

computer. and your punchy thingy.

24
00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:00.075
It's kind of nerdy yet athletic.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.246
Yeah. and... and
it is fairly good.

36
00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:53.086
The button is a little nerve right
here that's behind your jaw.

37
00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:58.088
If you hit somebody directly on the chin. it
knocks them out unconsciously like you...

38
00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.136
Sounds sexy.

39
00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:01.879
Right. What?

40
00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:06.387
Yeah. So. alright.

41
00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:09.345

42
00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.439

You all right?

49
00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:40.463
I am Sam bransby.
and this is my story.

50
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.638
I'm from Vegas... not that
Vegas... the real Vegas.

51
00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:46.636
Nobody's from Vegas. right?

52
00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.683
Who the fuck is from Vegas?

53
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.182
Outside of the stupid fucking
shows. and the shiny strip.

54
00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:53.376
and dudes thinking they're
high rollers for a weekend.

55
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.857
it's the Vegas that
nobody knows about.

56
00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:59.528
It's ugly. like. it's
hot. dry. and ugly.

57
00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:03.490
I have a dead mom from cancer
and a factory-working father.

58
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.159
What's my story?
My story is this.

59
00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.195
I have a chip on both shoulders.

60
00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.705
First one came when my mom died.

61
00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:15.189
Second one came when my old man's life
savings and pension was embezzled

62
00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.329
leaving me to take care of him.

63
00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:22.009
I was gonna wreck every bone in the
bodies of the ceo and coo that did it.

64
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.823
A developing
story late this afternoon.

65
00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:27.305
Police were called to the 500 block
of trailwood drive in summerlin

66
00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:32.432
where two prominent business executives were
found severely beaten and wounded in their car.

67
00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.353
But somebody else
got to them first

68
00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:38.225
so I went to work
for that somebody.

69
00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:53.995
Sam. you're sucking
on my thumb again.

70
00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:55.826
Hmm? Um.

71
00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.583
Put it back in there.

72
00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.585
No. it's wet.

73
00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.545
I like it when it's wet.

74
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.468
I want you to meet my dad.

75
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:57.183
All this talk about your dad is totally
putting the kibosh on my erection.

76
00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.935
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.735
Oh. it's a little bit
of a baby arm.

78
00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.404
Ha. ha. ha.

79
00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.856
It's a pee boner.

80
00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:10.567
What a dork! Wait!

81
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.032
Is it the pee or me
that's making you hard?

82
00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.034
Both.

83
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.285
No. no. it can't be both.

84
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.995
Sure. it can. =no.

85
00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:22.079
Yeah. because... okay. if you weren't
here I would have a pee boner

86
00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:25.290
having sex with you in my mind.

87
00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:28.303
Do you ever think of anybody else when
you... you're doing it in your mind?

88
00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:29.301
Rachael ray.

89
00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:30.928
Wait. wait. wait.
The cooking girl?

90
00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.257
Yeah. she's spunky.
=that is weird.

91
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:37.765
She's spunky. and she could make me a
delicious snack in 30 minutes or less.

92
00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.517
Oh. no. ufc Sam.

93
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.641
Come on. tomorrow...
Hey. tomorrow...

94
00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.148
My dad's coming back
from the Detroit office today

95
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.774
and so have lunch
with us tomorrow.

96
00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:51.325
You gotta tap. - Hey. hey. hey.
it's... see. I'm... easy. sweetie.

97
00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.360
So you're serious
about this. huh?

98
00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.032
Yeah.

99
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:58.456
Just like one of those relationship
stepping stones I guess.

100
00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:02.494
Yeah. - I don't know. it
just seems like very soon.

101
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.454
Soon? It's been seven
months. fucker!

102
00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:05.549
Oh!

103
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:10.760
The gestation period
for a deer is eight months.

104
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:13.880
A deer?

105
00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.306
Yes.

106
00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:18.055
So our relationship is not
even a full-grown deer yet.

107
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:22.397
Nice. Sam.

108
00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:29.612
I'm just saying. like. I'm
just nervous about that.

109
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.782
I mean. he's not
even your real dad.

110
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:40.949
Yeah. well. Mike's
dad to me. okay?

111
00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.044
Mike.

112
00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:52.294
I'll buy you some of those little
boy panties that you like.

113
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.131
and I'll touch myself in
front of you if you do it.

114
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.674
Let's call him right now.

115
00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.122
I wish you'd call him now. and
get out of the way because...

116
00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.228
- No.
- I'm just totally game for that.

117
00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.930
But...

118
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.140
Stop. What? Hello.

119
00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:06.896
- Quit.
- No. no. I actually got somebody.

120
00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:11.317
Oh. shit. no! I'm... I'm sorry.

121
00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:13.148
No. I'm already clean.

122
00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:13.857
Sam.

123
00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.408
Gra... gracias.

124
00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:19.071
Why do you have a maid service
programmed into your speed dial?

125
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.749
You see. um. this is
really important to me.

126
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:27.705
Okay? I mean. since
my mom's gone. il-

127
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:31.212
I used... I'm trying to keep some
semblance of a family together.

128
00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:35.639
Okay.

129
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.592
Alright. yes. I will meet Mike.

130
00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:42.973
- Yes. I will meet Mike. Yes.
- Oh. thank you. baby.

131
00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:44.709
=all right. There.
I love you. I love you.

132
00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:45.813
Yeah.

133
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.265
Pound on that.

134
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.851
I have to work in the
morning though so...

135
00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:53.985
Oh. yeah. what... they... they transferred
you? What are you doing now?

136
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:57.363
No. no. it's just the same...
It's just boring it shit.

137
00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.661
I'm sure it's not boring.
It's probably really cool.

138
00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:01.488
I mean. you're making
so much more money.

139
00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.645
What are you doing? - Yeah. yeah. no.
it is. It is. It's actually pretty cool.

140
00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:08.958
The dude. like. we have a head guy and
I'm pretty much like a bike messenger.

141
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.382
but they send us out to do...
To do it work. It's pretty cool.

142
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.801
The head guy or my boss.
he'll give me a call.

143
00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.298
Yes. hello.

144
00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.973
Is Sam there?

145
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.972
And he just gives me
like a quick rundown

146
00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.725
of what the job will be. and
where he's sending me.

147
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:26.850
Tommy.

148
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.774
How are you? Poor
beavers need to be fed.

149
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:32.902
Sideways.

150
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.980
That's what I said. sideways.

151
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:40.945
And the steelers are going to be
playing an excellent game this Sunday.

152
00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.039
Do you understand me?

153
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.073
And then he sends
me some paperwork.

154
00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.703
You know I bring it to you.

155
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.421
Oh!

156
00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:03.430
And like upfront cash 'cause our pay... you
know. 'cause I... it's a... a 1099 job.

157
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.806
like. I'm an independent
contractor/consultant.

158
00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:12.021
And then from that. I can get a basic idea of
what needs to be done or what the problem is.

159
00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:15.821
When I get there. so I know exactly
what kind of like. you know. geeky.

160
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.772
boring it shit I
need to bring there.

161
00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:24.034
And usually when I get there. it's
like nobody knows why I'm there.

162
00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:26.490
and it's like two cats
fucking in a bag.

163
00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.425
Yeah. excuse me. hi.

164
00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.973

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:05.870
No. They're fading.

171
00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:08.573
They're actually highlights. but
I'm getting it redone tomorrow.

172
00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:12.995
You should. You should because I think
that they bring out your inner spartan.

173
00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:14.795
Oh. my god.

174
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.800
Do you?

175
00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:19.887
Spartan?

176
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.014
I'm Josh. by the way.

177
00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.213
Yes.

178
00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:24.514
Absolutely. Josh.

179
00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:27.092
Oh...

180
00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.143
Oh my goodness.

181
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.390
My flamingoes.

182
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:31.641
Yay!

183
00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.190
- What?
- I ordered two live flamingoes for my-

184
00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.321
no.

185
00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:44.618
Oh. shits! Due to another
gang of meerkat slip...

186
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:53.831
You... you handle the flamingo situation.
I'm gonna go upstairs and find the server.

187
00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.417
Everything is gonna be...
Everything is gonna be fine.

188
00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:58.247
I'm probably gonna make noise.

189
00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:07.678
Why?

190
00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:14.268
This dude last week at my first job was.
like. the biggest fucking chauncey.

191
00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.194
Can I help you with something?

192
00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.864
I'm here to upgrade the server.

193
00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.369
I have a work order.

194
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.506
Who the fuck is this kid?

195
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:41.715
It guy.

196
00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.418
I didn't call for an it guy.

197
00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:46.470
Get him out of here. skinny.
I don't have time for this.

198
00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:48.843
Screech. hey. you gotta go.

199
00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:49.970
No.

200
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.015
Did you hear him?

201
00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.106
Hmm.

202
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.063
Tiny Tim. do I have to put a
bullet in your ass? Get out.

203
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.148
This is my head.

204
00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.234
My ass is down.

205
00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:08.784
Aim==- aim lower.

206
00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:10.956
Funny man.

207
00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.869
Whoa. whoa.

208
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.120
Hey. hey. hey.

209
00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:19.120
Jesus Christ!

210
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.510
What are you doing?

211
00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:31.515
Oh! Good show. man.

212
00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.058
I put you fucking down. boy.

213
00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.477
You're doing incredible. man.

214
00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:38.227
Put him right on the ground.

215
00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.524
And why does he have a gun?

216
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.610
What?

217
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.151
Why does he have a gun?

218
00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.524
He's my bodyguard.

219
00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:46.564
Well. I'm keeping this.

220
00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:53.538
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Look! Look! I
don't want any trouble. all right?

221
00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:54.989
Don't worry. It won't be okay.

222
00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.045
Good.

223
00:13:58.796 --> 00:13:59.831
What?

224
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:01.631
Good?

225
00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:02.546
Yeah.

226
00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:04.669
What? You're right.

227
00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:06.217
Maybe I should just go.

228
00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.302
I should just leave.

229
00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:09.886
Good idea.

230
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:11.927
- Right. I will.
- All right.

231
00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:21.141
But then I just show them why I'm
there. and they figure it out.

232
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.442
and then from that point
on it's pretty much simple.

233
00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:25.739
Is that right?

234
00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:26.782
Fuck you!

235
00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.948
I just hook up my laptop
to their system.

236
00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:30.400
Whoa!

237
00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:33.611
Run a diagnostic.
figure out the problem.

238
00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:36.664
and then I just get rid of. you know.
whatever's causing the problem.

239
00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:40.201
Holy shit! You're a bad guy.

240
00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:41.296
Get off.

241
00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:43.421
Get off of me.

242
00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.298
You little fuck.

243
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:52.512
Done.

244
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:21.660
Wow! Sounds like geeky it shit.

245
00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:25.622
Yeah. yeah. I know.
exactly. you bastard.

246
00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:27.206
Oh. come on! I'm kidding.

247
00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:28.962
I lay my life out on
the line for you...

248
00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:30.197
- I'm sorry.
- What do you do?

249
00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.462
- I bet you're amazing.
- I'm pretty badass.

250
00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.297
- I've noticed.
- I fuck shit up.

251
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:43.356
So who were these guys you
would essentially be targeting?

252
00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:47.442
Uh. sometimes CEOs or cfos.

253
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.272
but typically the big-money guys
or what's called placement agents.

254
00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:52.448
Placement agents.

255
00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:56.995
People who place large pension or other
retirement funds with hedge funds or other assets

256
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:00.039
- to ensure that they grow. correct?
- Yeah. yeah.

257
00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:02.617
They place them in what's
called alternative assets

258
00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.546
which really just means they
have access to the funds.

259
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:10.375
They can do whatever they want
with them. and then charge a fee.

260
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:16.761
But it's hard for them to not just skim off
the top of the pot. or shit. take the pot.

261
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:21.595
The entire state of Kentucky
got theirs taken by somebody.

262
00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:24.556
I'm gonna go 'cause pop
probably wants his breakfast.

263
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.186
Oh. yeah. how's your dad?

264
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.174
- He's all right. I guess.
- You tell him hello for me. okay?

265
00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.608
- I will.
- Give him a kiss.

266
00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:32.779
I will give him a kiss.

267
00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.027
Cheek or tongue?

268
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:35.574
Stop.

269
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.743
You want me to tongue
my dad for you? =no.

270
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.320
Both.

271
00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:42.999
All right. Hey.
don't you have to pee?

272
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:48.871
No. that's weird. It's like

273
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:51.423
totally gone.

274
00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:53.094
Where does it go?

275
00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:54.468
You are such a dork.

276
00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:56.275
Does it like seep into
my knee or something?

277
00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:57.179
I love you.

278
00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:58.927
I love you. too. donkey.

279
00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:00.932
So. remember. tomorrow lunch.

280
00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:03.469
Yes. Lunch. Big day.

281
00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:05.725
Meet the pops.

282
00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:09.650
All right. Later.
Yeah. I'll call you. Bye.

283
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:12.729
Hee-ya!

284
00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.242
Good morning. pop.

285
00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.493
Good morning.

286
00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:25.791
- Mwah!
- What are you doing? Get off me. Jesus!

287
00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:29.041
Easy. that's from Jen. She
says to say hello. =yeah.

288
00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:40.927
Why don't you watch in the big TV? I bought
you the big TV so you can see it better.

289
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:42.418
You should have her
over more often.

290
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.514
She makes a good
breakfast and on time.

291
00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:46.186
You don't like
company. dickweed.

292
00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:47.309
Up yours.

293
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:49.811
Up yours.

294
00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:54.028
Hey. pop.

295
00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:55.842
- What?
- Does it hurt when I do this to your arm?

296
00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:57.886
- Yeah. it hurts. bastard ass.
- That hurts your shoulder?

297
00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:58.910
Yes.

298
00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:05.706
Did you order something? =no.

299
00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:07.624
Sure? =no!

300
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.287
You didn't order any.
like. stones or cakes?

301
00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:12.872
No. no. no.

302
00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.127
Lug nuts? =no.

303
00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:15.218
Okay.

304
00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:20.721
Mr. bransbury.

305
00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:27.178
Hi.

306
00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:29.681
Bransby. Sure.

307
00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:32.809
What? Hey. paco. Enrique.

308
00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.018
That's not their names.

309
00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.424
Yeah. I know. I'm sorry.
I forget their names.

310
00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.439
What... what bring...
Why are you guys here?

311
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:41.032
What? Did I do something wrong?

312
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.365
No.

313
00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:50.618
It's what you don't right.

314
00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:52.373
Come here.

315
00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:56.048
Can you... can you give
us a minute. pop?

316
00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:57.529
=all right. All right.
Just give me a second.

317
00:18:57.553 --> 00:19:00.169
Go. Go watch sugars.

318
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:06.722
So. go ahead. you guys can
sit down. if you want. or stand.

319
00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.348
What the fuck are you eating?

320
00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:11.139
This? Apples and peanut butter.

321
00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:14.880
It's good. It's like two totally different
things going on inside your mouth. you know?

322
00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:18.146
It's... it's seriously good. It's like
a... it's like a mouth amusement park.

323
00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:20.697
Who's that?

324
00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:22.321
Hmm? That's donkey.

325
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:24.371
My girlfriend.

326
00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:25.243
It's Jen.

327
00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:26.662
You call her donkey?

328
00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:28.114
Yeah.

329
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.493
One time when we were in bed and
we were doing it. she farted.

330
00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:35.000
and we were watching winnie
the pooh at the same time.

331
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:39.460
She tried to blame the fart on
eeyore. the goddamn donkey. man.

332
00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:41.635
Ha. ha. I totally
knew it's her. duh!

333
00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:52.807
So I wanted to tell you that
you've recovered more funds

334
00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:57.443
in your first job than
any one of our other hits.

335
00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.610
Seriously?

336
00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:01.655
Fuck. that is awesome.
man. That is tits.

337
00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:03.762
Seriously. it was so cool. you
guys should have been there.

338
00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:08.120
The first dude. the one bodyguard. the skinny
black guy. I took his gun right from him.

339
00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.993
shot him with it as he
was on the ground.

340
00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:12.124
And then onteveros. I put
him in a rear naked choke.

341
00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:16.663
That shit was so deep. dude. I had him in the
whole time while I was doing the transfer.

342
00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:18.610
You know what that is. right? The
neck... you choke and you put...

343
00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.590
Yeah. I'm kind of
familiar with that move.

344
00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:27.507
I knew you weren't the typical it guy when
you brought torning soap with the bone.

345
00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:31.928
Over a white card.

346
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.726
Look. bro. I'm telling you. man.

347
00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:36.523
We evolved from
amphibians. All right?

348
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.566
=no. no. We used to have
tails and everything.

349
00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:42.050
No. bro. look. you need to get discovery
channel. okay? Because we come from primates.

350
00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.176
Where do you get amphibians?

351
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.886
What are you talking
primates. man. come on.

352
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.150
We come from amphibians.

353
00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:48.163
- We had tails.
- Where the fuck is my white card?

354
00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.283
I took it. I needed
one for home.

355
00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:53.019
We breathe through our skin.
You see these little holes.

356
00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.783
That's where we breathe through.

357
00:20:57.965 --> 00:20:59.876
People are always
taking my shit.

358
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:00.967
Yeah.

359
00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:04.333
Totally sorry about that. man.
It was... I lost my temper.

360
00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:08.176
Let's throw something. okay?
You can kill a man? Not an idea.

361
00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:13.093
You've done very
well for us. son.

362
00:21:14.732 --> 00:21:20.227
I... we came to deliver your
balance. and to tell you

363
00:21:21.864 --> 00:21:22.979
that this

364
00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.074
is hot a game.

365
00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:29.611
If you slip up. even once.

366
00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:34.957
this whole operation is connected
to us so you have to disappear.

367
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.170
You understand?

368
00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:39.503
- Yeah.
- Connection. bro.

369
00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:41.960
Yeah. I understand.

370
00:21:42.885 --> 00:21:44.000
Yes.

371
00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:49.054
This guy is a real
dickhead. you understand?

372
00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:56.055
He's been stealing auto workers' pension funds
and transferring them into Canadian accounts.

373
00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:59.558
I'his... this is my next job?
This is for me? =mm-hmm.

374
00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:06.569
This fucking guy. he offed his own wife a couple
of years back for asking too many questions.

375
00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:07.694
Oh. shit.

376
00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:08.785
Huh!

377
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.408
This is 187 million.

378
00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:14.864
This is crazy.

379
00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:17.701
What? There's no pictures
though. I need some pictures.

380
00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:19.877
No. you don't... you...
You don't need it. no.

381
00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:22.025
Everything you need for the
wire transfer is right there.

382
00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:23.369
You figure out
when you get there.

383
00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:26.758
I'll have. eh. cotto and chato
to guard the perimeter.

384
00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:29.003
Okay.

385
00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:32.308
So.

386
00:22:34.603 --> 00:22:36.685

I mean. you can
go out the front.

395
00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:07.221
You can go out the regular door. You
don't have to go through the window.

396
00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:17.139
Namaste.

397
00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:19.098

Thanks.

402
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.834
So Sam is meeting us
for lunch tomorrow.

403
00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:44.708
I can't have lunch
two days in a row.

404
00:23:44.798 --> 00:23:46.038
Why not?

What?

420
00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.501

Okay. All right.

to a word that I've been saying.

431
00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:06.960
I brought you a box.

432
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:10.293

561
00:34:07.504 --> 00:34:08.835
Sam. stop. Stop. Just...

562
00:34:08.922 --> 00:34:11.163
1 don't want him to
talk anymore. okay?

563
00:34:13.218 --> 00:34:14.674
This is what you do?

564
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.920
This is your geeky it shit?

565
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.552
This is how you solve all
of your problems. isn't it?

566
00:34:21.643 --> 00:34:24.555
I didn't lie. - You just beat
people up and you... you kill them.

567
00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:27.308
I take back from people
what is not theirs.

568
00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:29.765
It's like Robin hood except
I'm... it's like salmon hood

569
00:34:29.859 --> 00:34:31.128
except I'm not
a fish or anything like that.

570
00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:34.519
I just... this right here

571
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.356
is account 25. 29-

572
00:34:38.868 --> 00:34:41.359
$187 million

573
00:34:42.497 --> 00:34:43.497
that he took.

574
00:34:47.002 --> 00:34:48.082
From workers.

575
00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:53.234
The thing that's gonna be there when they
retire then it's not... it's not there.

576
00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:57.467
And then the workers sit for 18 hours
a day in front of the television

577
00:34:57.554 --> 00:35:01.718
because they're so fucking depressed that
they don't know their ass from their face.

578
00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:04.723
$187 million

579
00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:07.685
so that he can make wives

580
00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:11.815
that ask too many
questions disappear.

581
00:35:19.826 --> 00:35:22.158
Don't believe a thing
he says. Jennifer.

582
00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:25.408
Stop it. - I don't want him
to fucking talk anymore. okay?

583
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:27.830
Sorry.

584
00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:34.000
So what do we do now?

585
00:35:39.387 --> 00:35:46.509
I just transfer from this account
into my account in my system.

586
00:35:46.603 --> 00:35:47.603
And?

587
00:35:49.272 --> 00:35:51.684
I'd beat him until
he's unrecognizable.

588
00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:56.396
No. I can't... I can't. =yeah.

589
00:35:56.488 --> 00:35:57.978
- No.
- Yes. I have to.

590
00:35:58.073 --> 00:35:59.188
It's my job.

591
00:36:02.577 --> 00:36:04.033
Sam. I can't.

592
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.827
There are people who will make
me disappear if I don't do this.

593
00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:12.329
Sam. I love you. but
please just... just... just go.

594
00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:14.915
You know what? Just go.

595
00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:19.086
I can fix this.

596
00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:21.257
I'll just go talk to them
and you come with me. =no.

597
00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:23.795
Now. you fix this. come on. =no.

598
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.802
No. seriously. I can talk it
over with them. - No. just go.

599
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.760
I'll call you later.

600
00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:33.054
Yeah. call me later.

601
00:36:35.318 --> 00:36:41.564
1 don't want to go out there
without my shirt on. but I will.

602
00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:57.792
Fuckers! Fucking fuck me. man.

603
00:36:57.882 --> 00:36:58.621
All right. What?

00:36:58.717 --> 00:37:00.298
Lake it easy. =yeah.

605
00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:07.259

00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:10.133
Let's go. man.

607
00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:22.903
Pop.

608
00:37:22.991 --> 00:37:24.151
Pop. Hmm.

609
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.195
Wake up.

610
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:27.905
Wake up.

611
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:32.489
Oh. I messed up.

612
00:37:33.668 --> 00:37:35.829
Oh. boy. I really fucked up.

613
00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:42.795
This thing. it...

614
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.060
This==

615
00:37:53.855 --> 00:37:54.855
I just...

616
00:37:56.608 --> 00:37:57.608
Fuck.

617
00:37:59.736 --> 00:38:00.771
I need you to hide.

618
00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:03.152
- Hide?
- Yeah. I need you to hide.

619
00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:04.399
I don't wanna hide.

620
00:38:04.491 --> 00:38:05.651
And what the hell for?

621
00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:07.448
Come on. Come on.
Can you keep it down?

622
00:38:08.745 --> 00:38:13.205
Come on. pop. please.
okay? It's what I didn't do.

623
00:38:13.249 --> 00:38:14.614
All right.

624
00:38:14.709 --> 00:38:15.789
Jeez.

625
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:22.752
Please. just. this thing with
getting back the money and...

626
00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.550
Well. it went wrong. okay?

627
00:38:27.096 --> 00:38:31.214
- Yeah.
- Yeah. so just get in the box.

628
00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:32.347
In the box?

629
00:38:32.435 --> 00:38:34.596
Yeah. get in... get
in the table box.

630
00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:36.143
Come on.

631
00:38:36.231 --> 00:38:38.438
Poke holes in it like
I'm a hamster?

632
00:38:39.025 --> 00:38:40.731
Yeah. poke holes in it. =shit.

633
00:38:42.195 --> 00:38:44.006
All right. Just sit down
and I'll just put holes in it.

634
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.110
I'm sitting down.

635
00:38:47.033 --> 00:38:49.570
Is that enough? That's enough.

636
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:50.821
It's enough.

637
00:38:50.912 --> 00:38:51.947
All right.

638
00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:52.743
Jesus.

639
00:38:52.831 --> 00:38:53.866
Scoot over a little bit.

640
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:56.830
Put your hands up.

641
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.170
All right.

642
00:39:01.256 --> 00:39:02.462
Can you breathe?

643
00:39:02.549 --> 00:39:03.288
I'm in here.

644
00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:07.508
There's a stupid cocksucker!

645
00:39:07.595 --> 00:39:11.258
Easy. easy. easy. easy. easy.

646
00:39:11.307 --> 00:39:13.172
You fucking knew.

647
00:39:13.268 --> 00:39:14.411
You fucking knew it was her dad.

648
00:39:14.435 --> 00:39:16.175
You knew it all the time.
We did.

649
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:20.560
We did. but we needed to test you and
you know what? You failed the test.

650
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:21.810
You made it personal.

651
00:39:23.319 --> 00:39:24.964
She was standing right there.
Jen was right in front of me.

652
00:39:24.988 --> 00:39:26.507
Like. how am I supposed
to go through with it?

653
00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:27.531
I don't fucking care.

654
00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:29.397
That's not my problem.

655
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:32.909
You understand? You fuck up.

656
00:39:33.913 --> 00:39:38.031
All right. We need... we need to find... we need
to find some kind of middle ground here. okay?

657
00:39:38.126 --> 00:39:43.291
We need... we need to figure
out some form of homeostasis.

658
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:45.292
Homeo what?

659
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:48.529
You know. it's like a property of open
system particularly among living organisms

660
00:39:48.553 --> 00:39:50.418
to regulate the
internal environment.

661
00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:53.505
you know? It's something nice...
A stable constant condition.

662
00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:01.642
With all due respect to science.

663
00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:06.852
I told you if you
fuck up even once.

664
00:40:07.363 --> 00:40:08.728
you have to disappear.

665
00:40:11.868 --> 00:40:12.868
So come on.

666
00:40:15.121 --> 00:40:18.955
let's go bye-bye
in the car. huh?

667
00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:21.916
I'm gonna break your arm. Oh.

668
00:40:22.003 --> 00:40:25.712
Hey. easy. - What
happened to homeostasis?

669
00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:28.335
Oh. yeah.
you're right. You're right.

670
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:29.426
Pick him up.

671
00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:32.555
You're right. You're right
exactly. okay? Exactly.

672
00:40:32.597 --> 00:40:35.367
We got the same goal here. okay? We
got... we're going for the same thing.

673
00:40:35.391 --> 00:40:38.975
We just need to... we need...
We need to figure this out.

674
00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:44.352
In order for me to sustain my
operation I can't have any mistakes.

675
00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:50.233
Don't you understand? If even
one of these head honchos

676
00:40:50.323 --> 00:40:55.784
identifies us. it's bye-bye
pension recovery force.

677
00:40:59.332 --> 00:41:02.199
Pension recovery force.

678
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:04.826
That's got a ring to it.

679
00:41:04.921 --> 00:41:05.921
That's nice.

680
00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:08.337
Come on. let's go.

681
00:41:10.009 --> 00:41:10.873
Hi.

682
00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:12.925

00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:17.964
Oris it Jen. I guess?

685
00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:19.174
You told them?

686
00:41:19.268 --> 00:41:20.704
What? It came out of a
nervous conversation.

687
00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:22.208
I'm sorry about that.
Get out of here.

688
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:25.263
What do you mean get out of here

you requested. you goof.

690
00:41:31.447 --> 00:41:32.447
Thank you.

691
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.009
- Yeah.
- Thanks. Thanks a bunch.

692
00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:38.697
Yeah. And I. uh. disposed of Mr.
Knight for you like you asked.

693
00:41:38.788 --> 00:41:39.823
Good. Great.

694
00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:41.183
Appreciate that.
What? Wait a minute.

695
00:41:41.207 --> 00:41:43.664
What it... what is it that
she is talking about?

696
00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:49.246
Oh. I. well. you... Sam recruited me
as an inside man or woman. you know?

697
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.171
Woman.

698
00:41:51.259 --> 00:41:56.003
And so I have my dad's laptop in here.
and I saved all of his account names.

699
00:41:56.097 --> 00:41:58.759
and numbers. and passwords. and
all those locations and things.

700
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:02.593
I put them on the desktop. okay?
So you can just take that away.

701
00:42:02.687 --> 00:42:07.021
Yeah. and you know. there is a lot
more than $187 million in there.

702
00:42:07.108 --> 00:42:09.394
I guess you should
have dug a little deeper.

703
00:42:09.485 --> 00:42:12.192
Yeah. dig deeper. deep dickhead.

704
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.384
You know. here. I'm gonna give you this
back because this is... this is real heavy.

705
00:42:15.408 --> 00:42:16.427
- Yes. it is heavy.
- Okay.

706
00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:17.566
It's a heavy gun.

707
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.399
So...

708
00:42:18.494 --> 00:42:19.984
Can I get out now?

709
00:42:20.955 --> 00:42:22.820
Oops. sorry.

710
00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:26.032
Yeah. come on. pop.

711
00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:40.713

712
00:42:40.808 --> 00:42:42.173
Give me a call.

713
00:42:42.268 --> 00:42:44.224
I have a little
something for you.

714
00:42:46.522 --> 00:42:48.387
Jdd

715
00:43:03.206 --> 00:43:04.992
I talked to your dad today.

716
00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:06.289
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

717
00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:10.243
Kind of smooth things
over as best as I could.

718
00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:13.962
He was just mad about his
shoulder though. but that's okay.

719
00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:17.421
- Good.
- You know. when I talked to him.

720
00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:23.724
I also asked him if I could
give you a real one of these.

721
00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:28.640
So you can always be my donkey.

722
00:43:34.362 --> 00:43:35.647
Hi. burrito.

723
00:43:35.738 --> 00:43:37.478
What are you doing?

724
00:43:37.573 --> 00:43:38.779
Where did you come from?

725
00:43:38.866 --> 00:43:40.322
I got another job for you.

726
00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:42.596
Yeah. another job is great but
this is kind of like bad time.

727
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.407
I'm trying to. like. establish
a little something here.

728
00:43:45.498 --> 00:43:47.614
I know. What did she say?
She hasn't answered yet.

729
00:43:49.168 --> 00:43:50.533
So what's your answer?

730
00:43:50.586 --> 00:43:51.951
- Yes!
- Fuck you.

731
00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:54.582
This is crazy. man.

732
00:43:54.674 --> 00:43:57.040
- Oh. I got bubbles in my nose.
- You got bubbles in.

733
00:43:59.262 --> 00:44:00.672
Bubbles in my nose.

734
00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:06.049
I'm gonna get in with you.

735
00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:08.055
- Get out! No!
- Canl get in?

736
00:44:12.275 --> 00:44:13.890
- Just fuck off me.
- Why?

737
00:44:13.985 --> 00:44:16.665
What the fuck are you doing? Who the
fuck are you? Get the fuck off.

738
00:44:18.364 --> 00:44:19.774
Greatest year to date.

739
00:44:22.743 --> 00:44:24.734
Jdd

740
00:44:53.649 --> 00:44:54.889
All right. pop.

741
00:44:56.235 --> 00:45:00.820
There's these. anda I
got you some fresh j.

742
00:45:00.907 --> 00:45:02.613
You don't take that with that.

743
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.066
Don't wash that down
with that this time. right?

744
00:45:07.914 --> 00:45:09.199
That better not be my brother.

745
00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:13.248
Don't be a dick.
you bastard ass.

746
00:45:17.256 --> 00:45:19.212
I'nat's my brother Ronnie.

747
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.291
Ah. Ronnie.

748
00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:25.378
Ronnie had a little incident with ecstasy.
wasn't a good person to have around

749
00:45:25.473 --> 00:45:27.338
'cause he would call
the cops all the time.

750
00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:29.077
He would call the cops
when the cable went out.

751
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:30.807
He called the cops
on the toaster once.

752
00:45:36.442 --> 00:45:37.932
Get off him. man.

753
00:45:38.027 --> 00:45:39.892
Cut out the jujutsu crap.

754
00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:41.978
I'll cut it out when he
starts to contribute.

755
00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:43.233
Contribute.

756
00:45:43.324 --> 00:45:44.985
You said contribute twice.

757
00:45:45.076 --> 00:45:47.596
Well. yeah. whatever. What... tell
me that you're not here for money.

758
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.201
I only need $50.

759
00:45:49.288 --> 00:45:50.494
For what?

760
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:51.696
A new snorkel cap.

761
00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:52.912
He's going to sleep.

762
00:45:53.626 --> 00:45:55.082
Well. you wanna fight. huh?

763
00:45:55.169 --> 00:45:55.999
Yeah. wait.

764
00:45:56.087 --> 00:45:57.327
Knock it off.

765
00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:58.661
Back down.

766
00:45:58.714 --> 00:46:00.420
Sit down!

767
00:46:07.515 --> 00:46:10.382
Guys. guys. what is going on?

768
00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:13.012
Who the hell are these people?

769
00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:19.815
What are you doing with them?

770
00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.521
So she stepped in
and said she'd had enough.

771
00:46:25.908 --> 00:46:29.947
She flat-out told them
that I wanted to quit

772
00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:32.619
pension recovery force.

773
00:46:33.165 --> 00:46:34.165
Did you?

774
00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:36.167
Yeah.

775
00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:41.583
Part of me wanted to live a normal life
again. but I was also kind of addicted to it.

776
00:46:41.674 --> 00:46:45.337
kind of like. you know. when soldiers
go to war they hate the war.

777
00:46:45.428 --> 00:46:46.668
but they can't live without it.

778
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:49.086
Kind of the same thing with me.

779
00:46:56.981 --> 00:46:58.517
Hey. pop. how you doing?

780
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.113
You have some holes
in your game. Sam.

781
00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:11.776
You got a little something on
your chest that read pow-pow.

782
00:47:17.335 --> 00:47:18.575
Don't go out the window.

783
00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.785
Don't go out the window.

784
00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.996
My name is San tiago.

785
00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:25.918
Hey. relax.

786
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.500
You're not even Mexican.

787
00:47:27.595 --> 00:47:29.460
You're a puerto rican. motherf...

788
00:47:31.807 --> 00:47:32.842
Sorry.

789
00:47:34.393 --> 00:47:36.204
I know what it's like to have
difficulties with your brother.

790
00:47:36.228 --> 00:47:39.345
You hate him but you
need him for your go turn.

791
00:47:39.982 --> 00:47:42.598
Use that. strengthen
your undercarriage.

792
00:47:45.196 --> 00:47:46.777
That makes no sense.

793
00:47:51.994 --> 00:47:56.909
So we're engaged for one month. and
suddenly you're making decisions for me?

794
00:47:58.584 --> 00:48:00.870
I still don't know if I can
live with you doing this.

795
00:48:02.755 --> 00:48:03.961
Jdd

796
00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:10.485
You added a ton
of gates and fences.

797
00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:14.398
I did get him. man!

798
00:49:14.493 --> 00:49:16.779
You are a bulldog.

799
00:49:31.177 --> 00:49:33.293
Sam. meet kj chalk.

800
00:49:33.387 --> 00:49:35.594
We brought him
here to train you.

801
00:49:35.681 --> 00:49:40.015
You almost went down in your last job because
you keep dropping your fucking left.

802
00:49:40.102 --> 00:49:41.512
I like your flat ears.

803
00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:44.428
Oh. 'cause of the
cauliflower thing.

804
00:49:44.523 --> 00:49:46.138
Yeah.

805
00:49:46.233 --> 00:49:48.503
How did you get rid of it? They're
not all thick and bulbous anymore.

806
00:49:48.527 --> 00:49:49.527
Surgery.

807
00:49:51.197 --> 00:49:52.687
Why is he jacking me?

808
00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:10.250
You see this? This
is your next job.

809
00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:14.629
It's a fucking woman?

810
00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:19.093
She inherited her father's
tool and die shop.

811
00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:24.427
Twenty-eight machinists
that think that their pension

812
00:50:25.231 --> 00:50:33.195
is earning 9% but instead she
bought a condo in nice. France

813
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:41.280
so she could get her fucking pussy get
out ragged up by fucking euro guys. huh?

814
00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:45.956
Alright.

815
00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:47.658
Pause the training session.

816
00:50:47.753 --> 00:50:49.163
I almost got you in the nuts.

817
00:50:49.255 --> 00:50:51.120
I believe it's called
nice. France.

818
00:50:51.215 --> 00:50:52.955
I think it's pronounced hee-say.

819
00:50:54.009 --> 00:50:56.500
Like your sister's
daughter or something.

820
00:50:56.595 --> 00:50:57.710
Nice. France.

821
00:50:57.805 --> 00:51:01.138
With all due respect!
Excuse me. sweetheart...

822
00:51:02.142 --> 00:51:07.102
To geography. suddenly out... out of
the blue why... why is it a problem?

823
00:51:07.189 --> 00:51:09.976
You guys gotta be fucking with
me. huh? It's not about that.

824
00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:12.979
It's just about getting these dudes
back. and getting the money back.

825
00:51:13.028 --> 00:51:15.735
and just doing it old west-style.
and making them understand...

826
00:51:15.823 --> 00:51:18.815
Because that's not the way
I wanted to fucking go down.

827
00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:22.242
What I want is something to do
my way. I do it in my way. no?

828
00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:24.695
How do we work. Sam?
Tell me how we work.

829
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:26.872
We...

830
00:51:26.959 --> 00:51:30.355
When we work. how do we work? And don't get me
upset. you know. I don't like to get upset.

831
00:51:30.379 --> 00:51:31.789
My blood sugar is low.

832
00:51:34.216 --> 00:51:36.377
I don't have any food
on me right now.

833
00:51:36.468 --> 00:51:40.507
Tell me. what... what do we usually do?
What do we usually do?

834
00:51:40.598 --> 00:51:42.589
We prick your finger
and test your blood.

835
00:51:42.683 --> 00:51:44.048
Right.

836
00:51:44.184 --> 00:51:45.537
- And then... then we do what you say.
- Because you do right.

837
00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:47.222
Right. That's what we do.

838
00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:02.952
You know what?

839
00:52:04.204 --> 00:52:08.573
I think I know someboay
who can help you.

840
00:52:10.085 --> 00:52:12.076
1sk. tsk. tsk. pop. pop.

841
00:52:18.844 --> 00:52:20.175
Get out of here.

842
00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:23.004
Do what I tell you to do.
Come on. Let's go. I got dizzy.

843
00:52:28.937 --> 00:52:30.677
Jdd

844
00:53:02.554 --> 00:53:03.669
Hey.

845
00:53:06.892 --> 00:53:09.224
So why did you
want to meet here?

846
00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:13.637
What's... what's going on and
what... what's with the getup?

847
00:53:13.732 --> 00:53:18.943
And what's this all
about Mr. mohring?

848
00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:22.817
I'm here to do... I need... I
need you to punch a lady.

849
00:53:22.908 --> 00:53:24.819
- Oh. no. No.
- Let's go.

850
00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:28.743
Was that... when did
that clown get here?

851
00:53:31.166 --> 00:53:32.406
He's just a clown.

852
00:53:32.501 --> 00:53:36.494
What is he doing? No. I get it.
=yeah.

853
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:42.920
Oh!

854
00:53:43.011 --> 00:53:45.969
Oh. my god! What the fuck. Sam?
You fucking punched a clown.

855
00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.171
He freaks me out.

856
00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:49.598
- He freaked me out.
- Oh. my god! Are you okay?

857
00:53:50.853 --> 00:53:52.389
Ha. ha. ha.

858
00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:54.515
I get it. Punching the clown.

859
00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:57.181
Well. it's just the proximity.

860
00:53:57.276 --> 00:53:59.337
- I've never been in that proximity.
- Oh. my god. I'm so sorry.

861
00:53:59.361 --> 00:54:00.361
Dick.

862
00:54:02.072 --> 00:54:03.653

863
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.406

866
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.166

00:54:30.184 --> 00:54:32.015
Sir. you don't have
to do this for him.

872
00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:34.138
- Yeah.
- You don't have to do any of this.

873
00:54:34.229 --> 00:54:36.641
Done. And done.
We'll take care of this.

874
00:54:36.732 --> 00:54:38.313
I'll take the squeakies.

875
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.765
Squeegees. It's great.

876
00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:40.860
Clown lingo.

877
00:54:42.237 --> 00:54:44.477
Oh. I... I don't know that.
I don't know the clown lingo.

878
00:54:46.033 --> 00:54:48.115
Don't. Not again.

879
00:54:49.161 --> 00:54:54.451
Sam. so you asked me to come
here so that we can talk. - Right.

880
00:54:54.541 --> 00:54:56.532
And then you tell me
you want to punch a lady.

881
00:54:56.627 --> 00:54:57.627
Yeah. no.

882
00:54:57.669 --> 00:54:58.749
Should...

883
00:54:58.837 --> 00:55:02.295
What is going on out
here? Can I help you?

884
00:55:03.175 --> 00:55:05.086
Is that a clown?

885
00:55:07.221 --> 00:55:09.303
Creepy. right? I know.

886
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.505
You're creeping me out.

887
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.807
Oh. no. Here.
This... happy birthday.

888
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:16.180
I guess that's for
you. He had that.

889
00:55:16.271 --> 00:55:18.728
Turns out I'm not... I'm
the mid messenger here.

890
00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:20.397
I'm here... 1 need
to get in the shop.

891
00:55:20.484 --> 00:55:21.940

00:55:22.653 --> 00:55:24.518

Okay.

Just do whatever I say.
Just go with this. okay?

898
00:55:47.886 --> 00:55:55.383
Do you understand singing is very
soothing for this so... so in three. one.

899
00:56:02.067 --> 00:56:04.900
Please. please.

900

I wanna stay. papi.

901

I want you to know
that we are with you

902
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:18.993
most literally in this
room and in life.

903
00:56:20.878 --> 00:56:26.168
You were my father's
mentor back in '75.

904
00:56:28.176 --> 00:56:30.258
Tiny Bob was your father?

905
00:56:33.599 --> 00:56:35.009
Thank you for teaching me.

906
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:37.216
Now. I can feed my big baby.

907
00:56:37.769 --> 00:56:38.804
Pop-pop.

908
00:56:47.571 --> 00:56:48.571
Si.

909
00:56:49.907 --> 00:56:53.695
I get my height from my mother.

910
00:56:55.412 --> 00:56:59.121
Mr. bransby. I'm Roger.
and I'm here to save the day.

911
00:56:59.207 --> 00:57:00.207
Roger?

912
00:57:00.292 --> 00:57:01.702
Roger.

913
00:57:01.793 --> 00:57:05.957
Roger. that is great salesman
lingo. but I am not a pity case.

914
00:57:06.048 --> 00:57:08.755
Right. Don't... don't do
the salesman line. okay?

915
00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:11.629
Ah. yeah. duly noted.

916
00:57:13.013 --> 00:57:17.006
Mr. bransby. I'm here
to get you back on track.

917
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.263
Whoop. there I go again
with the salesmanship.

918
00:57:20.354 --> 00:57:23.846
Again. I am not a pity case.
Sam is taking care of me.

919
00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:25.752
- I don't want anything.
- No. it's not a pity case.

920
00:57:25.776 --> 00:57:28.438
As part of pension
recovery force.

921
00:57:30.739 --> 00:57:35.108
we feel it's our duty to set up
something stable for your future.

922
00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:38.285
We're gonna be setting up
some annuities for you.

923
00:57:38.372 --> 00:57:42.285
You're gonna have money
from money earning money.

924
00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:47.582
Hey. is there another wordsmith
in the room? Raise your hand.

925
00:57:47.673 --> 00:57:49.755
I'll raise it up one time.

926
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:51.172
Coming through.

927
00:57:52.177 --> 00:57:53.337
Something happened.

928
00:58:01.269 --> 00:58:02.600
What... what happened?

929
00:58:04.606 --> 00:58:08.519
Well. I fired all the office people because
they were just hideous. hideous people.

930
00:58:11.446 --> 00:58:12.446
Mad.

931
00:58:12.572 --> 00:58:15.655
Uh. so who are you.
and who are you with?

932
00:58:16.827 --> 00:58:20.035
Chuck rabot. c&c specialist. got
a call about a bear being out.

933
00:58:20.122 --> 00:58:22.408
I'm just gonna pop a
new one in there for you.

934
00:58:22.457 --> 00:58:26.416
This is my wife. Amelie poulain.
bring-your-wife-to-workday.

935
00:58:27.462 --> 00:58:29.828
Are you named from
the... the movie?

936
00:58:29.923 --> 00:58:31.003
- Yeah.
- I love France!

937
00:58:31.091 --> 00:58:32.706
Oh. wow. yeah.

938
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:33.916
Oh. boy.

939
00:58:35.387 --> 00:58:37.378
Oh. wow. no.

940
00:58:37.472 --> 00:58:41.681
It was just a giant.
giant coincidence.

941
00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:45.761
Oh. well. I love. love France.

942
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:50.770
Yeah. I was gonna relocate there to this
lovely villa in nice and then my father

943
00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:53.443
passed and left me this
god-awful factory to deal with.

944
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.486
Anyways. the workshop
is back here.

945
00:58:55.615 --> 00:58:59.483
Oh. my god! I've been to cannes.
but some people call it con.

946
00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:00.779
But I like to call it cannes.

947
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:03.787
Anyways. the shop is...

948
00:59:03.874 --> 00:59:05.990
She is gonna realize
that we're not following her

949
00:59:06.084 --> 00:59:08.200
and she's gonna be back
in here in 18 seconds.

950
00:59:08.295 --> 00:59:12.709
It takes me 57 seconds to transfer
all of her embezzled funds

951
00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:14.881
from her account
into my account.

952
00:59:14.968 --> 00:59:16.879
We have two choices
at that point.

953
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:18.460
She will catch us.

954
00:59:19.264 --> 00:59:20.970
And there are two choices.

955
00:59:21.058 --> 00:59:24.221
Either we get arrested and I go through
a lot of legal stuff and end up

956
00:59:24.311 --> 00:59:25.972
wearing a jumpsuit
for a long time.

957
00:59:26.063 --> 00:59:29.681
=-no. Option b. you punch
her. right in the button.

958
00:59:29.775 --> 00:59:33.609
knock her out and we walk
out of here unscathed. Sam.

959
00:59:34.154 --> 00:59:40.775
Four. three. just be part
of this. two. one.

960
00:59:40.869 --> 00:59:41.699
Oh. shit.

961
00:59:41.787 --> 00:59:42.617
Excuse me.

962
00:59:42.704 --> 00:59:44.240
This is my office.

963
00:59:44.831 --> 00:59:47.163

Oh! Oh. my god.

Just be part of this.

971
01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.099
How do you know about this?

972
01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:14.190
I know where the button is.

973
01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:23.154

something you guys do or what?

Here's another thousand
if you'll just help me.

979
01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:34.665

987
01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:52.212
No. Just... just right now... right now it
would be great if we can just move him out.

988
01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:53.459
All right. Well. I need
you to sign first.

989
01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.815
Oh. my god. Just give it...
Give it to me. Fine.

990
01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:57.438
Oh. my god.

992
01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:01.570
Here... here. no.

993
01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:05.617
Tuesdays and Thursdays. - Please.
just... just grab a part of him. and...

994
01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:09.571
Is he dead or... am I
moving a dead guy?

995
01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:12.161
No. no. no. I... we just have
to get him to somewhere.

996
01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:13.729
- I don't know.
- 'Cause. I mean. I'm not gonna...

997
01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:14.993
Oh. oh god.

998
01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:17.500
Is he... he's dead. ma'am. Um...

999
01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:18.922
Coming through.

1000
01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.375
Something happened.

1001
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:24.586
What... what happened?

1002
01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:27.201
I... 1... I don't know. He got hit in
the head really hard. and then-

1003
01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:30.137
and his pulse was low and I didn't
want to take him to the hospital.

1004
01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:33.311
Right. Right. Right.
But what happened?

1005
01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:36.351
He passes out at the sight
of his own mouth blood.

1006
01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:37.853
It's pretty cool.

1007
01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:40.651
Christ! Ronnie put something on
his head when they were kids.

1008
01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:45.817
Ow-wee! Ow-wee!

1009
01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:48.493
You know what it means when
your mouth bleeds. don't you?

1010
01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:50.449
It means you have a fly

1011
01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.746
living in your jaw.

1012
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.211
Can I get out of here?

1013
01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:05.590
You know what? I actually
am gonna skedaddle as well.

1014
01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:10.806
You mind dropping me off at
the clean needle exchange?

1015
01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:12.475
Talk.

1016
01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.624
- Oh. I passed out at first.
- You got kicked in the head?

1017
01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:17.668
Yeah. I could have ducked. She got me in the
forehead. and then I did the stiff leg.

1018
01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:22.652
stiff arm thing just for like
causel just wanted to watch you.

1019
01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:25.655
and make sure that you did
it. and you came through.

1020
01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.620
She was great. She was
like part of the team now.

1021
01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:32.738
Oh!

1022
01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:37.827
It was a ruse?
It was a fucking ruse?

1023
01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:42.126
I don't even use the
word ruse or fucking...

1024
01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:48.628
You wanted... you turn me into something
that I don't even know what.

1025
01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:52.090
Sam. you have been lying to me.

1026
01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:56.936
With all these... these lies
and lies and lies and you...

1027
01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.893
You tricked me.

1028
01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:06.446
You know after what you did to my dad. you
know. it feels like you just took my heart

1029
01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:10.117
and you just attached it to the back
of a couple of tractors. and told them

1030
01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:12.660
to drive in opposite
directions. you know?

1031
01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:16.866
I hate what you are doing.

1032
01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.120
I'm not hurting innocent people.

1033
01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:27.250
I need you to be
on board with this.

1034
01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:30.052
And you made me punch
a woman I don't know.

1035
01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:36.218
You know. you think it's okay because they're
bad people. What you are doing is wrong.

1036
01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:40.983
I disagree.

1037
01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:43.517
I'm done with this.

1038
01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.270
I'm done with this.

1039
01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:47.194
Calm down.

1040
01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:49.273
I am done with you.

1041
01:03:57.167 --> 01:04:01.501
You know. you... you need to
handle your business? Handle it.

1042
01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:06.624
This girl. she's walking
out. all this information.

1043
01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:10.552
The fuck is wrong with
you. you stupid motherfucker?

1044
01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.839
You know I don't
like to get upset. Sam.

1045
01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.641
My blood sugar
is high right now.

1046
01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:19.344
You fucked this one up.
little motherfucker.

1047
01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:22.066
Yeah.

1048
01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:26.477
It was your idea.

1049
01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:29.396
I don't feel good.

1050
01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:32.824
You are gonna give me fucking
diabetes. you know? Fine.

1051
01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:34.943
I'm gonna eat something now.

1052
01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:07.767
Oh. hell to the uh.

1053
01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:10.569
Diantre's ass was
out drinking all day.

1054
01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:13.194
and he thinks he's gonna go out
with his friends again tonight.

1055
01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:14.284
Uh=uh.

1056
01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:18.015
I hate when Mark does shit like
that. but you know what Mark does?

1057
01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:22.658
He drinks and then he has this
amazing idea to go drive somewhere.

1058
01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:23.958
Brilliant.

1059
01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:27.579
Does Sam do shit like that. Jen?

1060
01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:29.716
Jen.

1061
01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:32.136
Jen.

1062
01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.469
Earth to zoned-out bitch.

1063
01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.930
Welcome back. yeah.

1064
01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:45.935
Yeah. you know. he's... oh.
he's got his vices. yeah. sure.

1065
01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:48.152
Sure. yeah.

1066
01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:50.634
That's what they call
them these days.

1067
01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:55.774
So by vices you mean what?

1068
01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:57.369
Yup.

1069
01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.195
You know what that means.

1070
01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:03.536
I'm sure he does.

1071
01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:04.626
Yeah.

1072
01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:07.543
So you know what I did. guys?

1073
01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.298
What?

1074
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:16.170
I let him leave. and then I call the
cops. and I reported a drunk driver.

1075
01:06:16.264 --> 01:06:18.801
- Holy shit.
- Yeah. it happened.

1076
01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:20.223
And you turned in your man?

1077
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.266
- Hell. yes. I did.
- Did he get caught?

1078
01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:25.220
Hell. yes. he did and you know
what? He don't drink no more.

1079
01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.398
- Oh my.
- Oh. so wait. his drinking got so bad

1080
01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.225
that you decided you
were gonna turn him in?

1081
01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:37.065
And then. oh. after he got arrested he
just learned his lesson. so to speak?

1082
01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:39.950
Let me tell you
something. little lady.

1083
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:43.037
From my life experience.
I have realized

1084
01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:47.667
sometimes you have to
kick a boy in the nuts.

1085
01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:52.464
And in this case by... and in...

1086
01:06:53.551 --> 01:07:00.639
And in this case the kick in the nuts
was a night in the pokey and a dul.

1087
01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:04.038
Did he find out that you
were the one that turned him in?

1088
01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:08.396
Oh. hell no. and even if he does. I mean.
who bailed him out and then tugged him off.

1089
01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:11.440
I... he was okay with that?

1090
01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.564
Yes. he was okay with that.

1091
01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:15.395
There's Monica newlove.

1092
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:18.698
Hands in the middle!
Liquid brunch on three.

1093
01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:21.948
- One. two. three. liquid brunch.
- Liquid brunch.

1094
01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.038
Adjourned.

1095
01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:29.291
I can't get this
blood off my shorts.

1096
01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:36.750
Try using peanut butter.

1097
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.007
Peanut butter? That's brilliant.

1098
01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:41.254
Gum in the hair?

1099
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:42.885
Oh. milk. man.

1100
01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:46.184
Just soak it in milk first and
then you use the cold water. man.

1101
01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:48.269
Peanut butter.

1102
01:07:48.356 --> 01:07:50.543
You confuse the gum and
the peanut butter. Come on. man.

1103
01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.711
Why don't we get that
to... why don't we get that to...

1104
01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:57.855
You confuse gum
and peanut butter? Big guy.

1105
01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.069
Same texture.

1106
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.952
Sam. what are you doing here?

1107
01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:08.748
I want another job.

1108
01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:10.252
No.

1109
01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:14.329
We-=... you've been
very busy already.

1110
01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.255
Now. take a break.

1111
01:08:16.342 --> 01:08:20.961
We already have one of our herbal double
cheeseburgers taking care of seeds.

1112
01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:24.388
Yeah. Go... go home. Relax.

1113
01:08:24.976 --> 01:08:27.467
Drink some milk or something.

1114
01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:28.562
Control.

1115
01:08:28.605 --> 01:08:31.017
Remember. I told
you control is good.

1116
01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:35.942
I just gotta get my mind off donkey.
and all these pent-up-ness.

1117
01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:38.311
I need to unpent it.

1118
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:45.785
Find me another job.

1119
01:08:46.873 --> 01:08:47.873
Okay. Breathe.

1120
01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:53.538
Breathe in. out.

1121
01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:56.166
They're doing it. too.
so it's distracting.

1122
01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.293
Let me see what I got.

1123
01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.846
No. that's not gonna work.

1124
01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:08.015
It's too much.
You're not ready yet.

1125
01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:10.597
Okay. Do you have a suit?

1126
01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:15.098
Alright. so does
this make you feel better?

1127
01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:16.098
Yeah.

1128
01:09:16.235 --> 01:09:17.235
Grab a seat.

1129
01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.989
It's more private here
so we can talk.

1130
01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.362
Vim-hmm.

1131
01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:26.453
Hmm.

1132
01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:28.657
Ouch.

1133
01:09:28.748 --> 01:09:30.659
Um. can you do that
some other time?

1134
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.286
- Yeah. well. I'll get it later.
- Okay.

1135
01:09:33.378 --> 01:09:34.743
So continue.

1136
01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:37.791
So this person who I know.

1137
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:44.386
technically. is breaking the law
by doing something illegal.

1138
01:09:44.472 --> 01:09:52.472
He. you know... or she. is hurting
people and stealing from them but...

1139
01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:53.724
Okay.

1140
01:09:53.815 --> 01:09:55.430
Do I know you.
detective o'Hayes?

1141
01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:58.728
I brought you a box.

1142
01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:02.445
Just put the lettuce in the box.

1143
01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:04.905
Don't think so.

1144
01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:06.027
Oh.

1145
01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:12.490
Okay. Okay. I got something for you. We got
two guys. It's a health care partnership.

1146
01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:19.372
They wanna buy land. and you're
going to sell them some. Sam. okay?

1147
01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:20.734
So just tell me
about this person?

1148
01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:23.124
Well... well. hold on.

1149
01:10:24.178 --> 01:10:28.217
He's doing it to people
who have also stolen.

1150
01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:32.224
The problem is

1151
01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:38.808
we have to find out where
they're funneling the money.

1152
01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:44.980
Almost. So kind of like
a scissor home?

1153
01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:48.282
Yeah. No. Wait. What...
What's a scissor home?

1154
01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:56.496
They take on high risk-premiums. and then
drop them as soon as they get a cold sore.

1155
01:10:58.713 --> 01:11:03.673
So you're going to
squeeze them like. um.

1156
01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:10.429
Like a cold sore.

1157
01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:12.472
That's good.

1158
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.300
Yeah. that hurts when
you do that. though.

1159
01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:15.414
You're not supposed
to squeeze them.

1160
01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:19.147
No. Wait. What...
Okay. well. never mind.

1161
01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:27.148
The bottom line is that this person
who I care about is hurting people.

1162
01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:28.947
but they re bad people.

1163
01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:31.026
Okay.

1164
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:35.739
And so I'm just trying to figure out if I
could maybe get him arrested or. you know.

1165
01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.575
scare him enough just
to get him to stop doing it.

1166
01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:41.744
You think you can handle that?

1167
01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:43.381
Yes.

1168
01:11:45.676 --> 01:11:48.008
- You feel strong. right? You can do it?
- Yes. Yes.

1169
01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:50.677
Okay. Then you're
ready. no? Hey.

1170
01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:58.394
Hey. Sam. be very careful.

1171
01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:03.141
These guys are big.

1172
01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:08.900
Are you going to sleep?

1173
01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.822
Yeah. don't worry. baby. yeah.

1174
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:12.571
Yeah. baby.

1175
01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:15.870
Okay. Well. first of all. you can't
take the law into your own hands.

1176
01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:17.743
It's not the wild west anymore.

1177
01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:19.417
Hmm.

1178
01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:21.955
So you can't give me a name?

1179
01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:34.638
Mm=-mm.

1180
01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:36.556
How about at least you
give me your name?

1181
01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.059
Yeah. no.

1182
01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.229
Whoa. sit down.

1183
01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:46.434
Just sit down.

1184
01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:51.815
Yeah. yeah. listen. I mean.
you came here to us.

1185
01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:54.533
We're here to help you. right?

1186
01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:02.167
So why don't you just report that crime
that you wanted to report. okay?

1187
01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:04.796
I got it.

1188
01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:06.298
Yeah.

1189
01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:23.041
You have you ever
had Louisiana fried chicken?

1190
01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.147
=no. man.
Hey. tavares. thaddius.

1191
01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.644
Yeah. Yeah.

1192
01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:29.318
You remember that bigwig we were
tailing a couple of weeks ago.

1193
01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.361
a guy that we thought
killed his wife?

1194
01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:35.024
Yeah. Yeah.

1195
01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:38.703
Yeah. well his stepdaughter just came
in here and wanna report a crime.

1196
01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:40.154
It was very obtuse.

1197
01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:43.707
Who was that guy she was
with a couple of days ago?

1198
01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:45.497
Oh. man.

1199
01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:51.799
I think it was just some
random guy she was dating.

1200
01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:54.406
Oh. you know? I don't
think there was anything there.

1201
01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.009
All right. Thanks. fellows.

1202
01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.940
- All right.
- No problem.

1203
01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.029
So you turned me in?

1204
01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.304
At least you could have
cracked the windows for me.

1205
01:14:17.328 --> 01:14:19.489
Your greenhouse affected
the shit out of me.

1206
01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:27.168
So you were just gonna
let me turn you in.

1207
01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:29.666
you know. instead of just telling
me what you did to my mom?

1208
01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:36.086
Look. you've been holding
me hostage like Dolly parton

1209
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.216
in "9 to 3" trying to
get this shit out of me.

1210
01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:43.552
I keep telling you. Jen. you
really don't want to know.

1211
01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:46.022
Yeah.

1212
01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:51.518
Ready to turn me in? Yeah. 'cause
I got lawyers. I got money.

1213
01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:55.947
And this case will circle and
circle and circle and circle.

1214
01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:59.179
and it'll be years before they find out the
gruesome details about what happened...

1215
01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:03.162
Oh. what... gruesome details?

1216
01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:06.825
Oh. so. that's it?

1217
01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:15.215
You know. in the back of my
mind I was... I was just wishing

1218
01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:20.387
that you had sent her away. you
know. and that I could go find her.

1219
01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:21.474
And-

1220
01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:27.763
wow! I guess I'm just naive.

1221
01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:31.056
Like I keep saying.

1222
01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:34.898
things got complicated.

1223
01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:37.571
- Complicated?
- Yeah.

1224
01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:38.658
Right.

1225
01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:41.029
- Asshole.
- Aww. shit. aww.

1226
01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:42.495
Damn.

1227
01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:14.392
Well. here's the 15.000 acres.

1228
01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:17.311
15.000 acres.

1229
01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.442
Wow! Development. ihaddius.

1230
01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:22.696
We're gonna definitely put
some hew life into this land.

1231
01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.735
It's all been sucked out.

1232
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:28.072
Well. after all. that's what
we do. right? We suck it out.

1233
01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:32.497
I'hat was an inside
joke. kid. don't worry about it.

1234
01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:34.266
- Inside.
- After all.

1235
01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.500
That was wild country. right?

1236
01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:36.584
Wild country.

1237
01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:40.363
Did you guys know that a
squirrel that lives in captivity

1238
01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:43.800
lives as long
as 15. to 20 years.

1239
01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:48.260
but a squirrel that's in the
wild only lives for one year.

1240
01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:49.469
Thanks for that.

1241
01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.834
What are you doing? Dude. what
are you like getting gay on us?

1242
01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:54.894
What? No. no. no.

1243
01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:59.194
You two remind me of squirrels. you know. so I
just... I'm sorry... I was just stretching.

1244
01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:00.737
- A short joke.
- A metaphor.

1245
01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:02.031
A short joke.

1246
01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.553
- I know what.
- Up yours.

1247
01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.514
Maybe we should keep
you out of the way tavares.

1248
01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:07.369
Let's get out of here.

1249
01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:14.251
Well. what I wanna know is what did you
guys do with the embezzled healthcare fund?

1250
01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:16.954
Where's that at? I need to find out that.
Where's that money?

1251
01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:18.880
You. sir. are way out of line.

1252
01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:22.131
You know what? Yeah. way out of it. Don't
worry about it. it's not your problem.

1253
01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:24.825
Yeah. okay. here's what's gonna happen.
You see. I am your bad guy.

1254
01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:26.510
You guys... you do bad things

1255
01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:30.218
and I know about it so I could just
let our wonderful justice system

1256
01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:32.678
kind of handle it over time.
but instead what I'm gonna do

1257
01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:35.560
is I'm just gonna put
you both in pain...

1258
01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:38.939
Until you
tell me... until you tell me

1259
01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:43.523
where the accounts are. where the money's
at. right? I just... but don't worry.

1260
01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:46.905
I'm gonna treat you like
normal-sized persons. okay?

1261
01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:50.159
I'm... I'm gonna make you
feel equal and in pain.

1262
01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:56.418
Unless. I really hit
like... like down.

1263
01:17:56.505 --> 01:18:00.293
Well. how about this. Sam
bransby? You're under arrest.

1264
01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:01.464
No.

1265
01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:02.166
Why don't you put your hands up?

1266
01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:03.261
No. What?

1267
01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:04.531
You're under arrest.

1268
01:18:04.555 --> 01:18:06.045
=all right. - You guys are cops.

1269
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.576
You have the
right to remain silent.

1270
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.965
Put your hands up where... =no.

1271
01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:11.288
What? - Yeah. like I said.
put your hands up right now.

1272
01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:13.598
No. no. no. you guys are cops.

1273
01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.771
You know what? Just put
your hands up. All right?

1274
01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.849
You're cops.
You're fucking cops.

1275
01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.399
=-I'hat's right. Let's go. man.

1276
01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:24.817
What the fuck?

1277
01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:28.112
Damn trouts! Bullshit.

1278
01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:29.204
Come on.

1279
01:18:38.589 --> 01:18:40.830
Where the fuck is the account?

1280
01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:44.924
Get off of me.

1281
01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:48.341
Get him off.

1282
01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:53.639
Just let it happen.
Just let it happen.

1283
01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:56.220
Jdd

1284
01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.969
For a soundbite. tell
the camera where you are now.

1285
01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:48.658
Jail.

1286
01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:50.984
I'm... I'm in fucking jail.

1287
01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:55.533
This... you can't just haul
off and get after people.

1288
01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:58.081
This is full-on prison.

1289
01:19:58.168 --> 01:19:59.168
Oj is here.

1290
01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:00.743
He was here.

1291
01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:03.245
He was my mess hall buddy.
kind of a douchebag though.

1292
01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.626
You know. typically like
black guys are cool.

1293
01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:08.300
They don't fall into the
douchebag category.

1294
01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:09.627
Oj is a douche.

1295
01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.678
He really is a douche.

1296
01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:16.054
Your official charges were
never listed as murder 1.

1297
01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:19.012
Out of all the people you
killed. how did you even get...

1298
01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:22.439
I didn't kill anybody? Did you see me
kill anybody? No. I never killed anybody.

1299
01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:24.482
That's the fun thing
about my case.

1300
01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:28.604
Yeah. No. They... that was...
That wasn't the point.

1301
01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:33.284
The point was to hurt them.
wake up every day with pain.

1302
01:20:34.288 --> 01:20:37.872
Pain from a bullet in their pelvis. or
in their elbow. or on their shoulder.

1303
01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:38.993
and their neck.

1304
01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:40.415
Just pain every day.

1305
01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:44.837
That's what they deserve
for their wrongdoing.

1306
01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:48.791
Yeah. but I was never
out to kill anybody.

1307
01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:54.255
And you've been granted
parole. released in 90 days.

1308
01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:57.850
Yeah. I gave them a shitload
of evidence. good behavior.

1309
01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:00.768
Do you feel that
you're rehabilitated?

1310
01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:01.644
Yeah.

1311
01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.142
Yeah. Oh. yeah.

1312
01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:06.851
Made bad decisions. bad choices
in the past. but not anymore.

1313
01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:09.781
Thank you. Sam.

1314
01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:11.404
That's it.

1315
01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:12.777
- Okay.
- I appreciate your time.

1316
01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:15.154
I will send you a copy of
the segment when it's done.

1317
01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:16.280
Okay.

1318
01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:20.122
Right. Excuse me.
I'm just gonna...

1319
01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:22.077
Oh. sorry.

1320
01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:24.455
Right here.

1321
01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:26.002
That is on.

1322
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:29.048
And let me just...

1323
01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:31.667
All right. That is off.

1324
01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:33.846
Great.

1325
01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:39.175
And the guards have
my equipment bag

1326
01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:41.989
so I'll just get them and then come
grab your mic. and be right back.

1327
01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:43.679
Do you stay here or...

1328
01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:46.853
No. No. They'll...
They'll come get me.

1329
01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:55.741
Am I rehabilitated?

1330
01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:01.659
Jdd

1331
01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:52.884
Ronnie.

1332
01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:01.715
Sorry I turned you in.

1333
01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:13.690
Fucking kidding me?

1334
01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:15.983
The whole fucking time.

1335
01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:17.860
Fucking ingrate!

1336
01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:21.819
Take me to the airport.

1337
01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:26.240
- Huh?
- Take me to the airport.

1338
01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:28.538
Open the door.

1339
01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:37.088
What the hell did
you do to dad's car?

1340
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.886
Fuck.

1341
01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:47.519
Where are we going?

1342
01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:48.686
The airport.

1343
01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:49.638
Which one?

1344
01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:51.894
The Reno.

1345
01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:53.813
Where are you going?

1346
01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:54.862
Phuket.

1347
01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:58.272
What? What the fuck is Phuket?

1348
01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:02.196
I didn't... I didn't
tell you that. Just go.

1349
01:24:03.247 --> 01:24:04.487
Seat belt.

1350
01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:14.080
It's a desert road.
Nobody is coming.

1351
01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:14.959
Okay. man.

1352
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.836
Jdd
