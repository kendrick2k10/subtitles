00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.600
Welcome to Coming to the Morning show.

4
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.960
I’m Alero Obaseki

5
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.880
and with me this morning is aspiring politician.

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.720
Jide Pedro.

7
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.360
Today. we’ll be talking about

8
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.880
his journey to the Senate

9
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.240
and why following his father’s footsteps

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.680
as the former senate president

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.320
has been a long time coming.

12
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.480
You know. it was quite surprising to us

13
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.360
when your father took a back seat

14
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.720
after his tenure as the senate president.

15
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.880
and now. years later.

16
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.560
you’re following his footsteps.

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.680
Beautiful.

18
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.960
So please tell us.

19
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.440
how has the journey been so far?

20
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.800
Tell us how it has been till date.

21
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.000
And did you ever think you would be

22
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
vying for a seat at the senate

23
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.120
at this point of your life?

24
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.080
Well I- (Pause) -I ….

25
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.120
You want me to repeat the question?

26
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.360
My journey to the senate so far

27
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.640
has been very unclean.

28
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.680
I guess it’s true you could say

29
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.800
as part of this work

30
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.759
I’ve been following my father’s footsteps.

31
00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:51.039
But that’s not really my truth.

32
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.160
Could you please tell us what you mean by that?

33
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.120
And what is your truth?

34
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:30.120
[Singing and laughing]

35
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.320
[Sigh]

36
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.400
What was that?

37
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.400
We just hit someone

38
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.920
O my God! O no! O my God!

39
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.520
Where did you come from?!

40
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.160
Eh Jide!. she’s not moving!

41
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.680
She just came out of nowhere

42
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.120
We need to do something.

43
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.440
We need to take her to the hospital

44
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.120
What!

45
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.200
No no no!

46
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.880
Come on. help me.

47
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.640
No no no. we can’t.

48
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.280
If we do that. we’re done for.

49
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.000
we can’t do that.

50
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.400
Are you out of your mind?

51
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.720
Jide. she’s just a child!

52
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.159
Look. I can’t be seen here.

53
00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.880
We have to leave this place.

54
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.560
We have to get out of here right now.

55
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.360
No no no!

56
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.000
No we have to leave here

57
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.840
No no no.

58
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.520
Listen. no. come baby

59
00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.640
No. Let’s go.

60
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.200
No no no. we can’t be here.

61
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.480
Please. please - get in the car.

62
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.640
[Car engine starts]

63
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.520
[Screeching sound as car drives off]

64
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.600
What is wrong with you?

65
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.240
We need to go back now. Jide!

66
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.600
I’m trying to think here.

67
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.480
Nooo!

68
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.280
O my God!

69
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.720
[Heaves]

70
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.040
Get yourself together. Hawa.

71
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.840
That girl is dead back there

72
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.400
- Or she’s going to be dead in minutes.

73
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.440
O my goodness!

74
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.840
And then. how would we even explain it?

75
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.720
She just came out of nowhere.

76
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.520
Look. there was nothing we could have done to save this girl. nothing

77
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.600
- O my God!

78
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.360
[Crying and sighing]

79
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.240
It will be okay.

80
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.520
Don’t worry.We’ll be fine.

81
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.080
We’ll sort it out. okay?

82
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.640
Madam.

83
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.360
what’s up with you?

84
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.560
You’ve been distant of late. what’s going on?

85
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.840
And you barely said a word at the meeting today.

86
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.480
That’s unlike you. babe.

87
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.920
Is everything okay?

88
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.720
Hello guys.

89
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.960
The MD is waiting for you in his office right now.

90
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.320
The MD is back.

91
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.560
and he actually said he will be leaving in the next 30 minutes.

92
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.720
He’s actually just here for the briefing.

93
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.480
Thanks Jerome. we’re coming.

94
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.040
Okay

95
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.080
So you wanted to say something?

96
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.480
Nothing really.

97
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.360
I’ve just been under the weather lately.

98
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.760
I see. So have you had some -

99
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.640

100
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.840
Thank you.

101
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.920
Okay. let’s go.

102
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.000
You do not want to keep the MD waiting

103
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.920
Yep.

104
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.480

109
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.520

113
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.440
Thank you

114
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.760
Hello

115
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.200
Hi

116
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.280
Why are you still not home?

117
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.200
I was having a drive after work

118
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.720
A drive at 10pm!

119
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:43.360
I went to see - to see if she was still there.

120
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.040
Are you trying to get us caught?

121
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.160
You can’t go back to a crime scene.

122
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.640
What if someone had recognized you

123
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.040
from the other night?

124
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.040
Is that all you’re concerned about?

125
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.320
That girl is somebody’s child and we left her out there.

126
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.920
What is wrong with you?

127
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.520
Yeah. you’re right.

128
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.520
I know she was somebody’s child.

129
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.520
So was she still there?

130
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.120
The way you’re going.

131
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.200
you will be dead drunk

132
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.680
before the night even begins

133
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.840
Sorry sir

134
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.560
You came late. and your best plan was to start drinking heavily?

135
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.520
Alright. where is your wife?

136
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.200
She couldn’t make it. sir.

137
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.200
I told you how important tonight was.

138
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.880
The senator love the idea of family.

139
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.040
If Hawa were here. you’d get his support easily.

140
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.960
She was just a bit ill before I left the house.

141
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.680
She’s under the weather.

142
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.960
She had to choose tonight to be under the weather.

143
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.840
I’m sure it wasn’t intentional.

144
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.440
Get your acts together.

145
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.640
Do not embarrass me.

146
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.680
The senator will soon be here.

147
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.240
Get my son some water

148
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.760
Hi you

149
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.360
we need to see

150
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.480
like very. very urgent.

151
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.560
Who’s that at this time?

152
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.360
Uh. I was trying to reach customer care.

153
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.680
Data issue.

154
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.680
Too many people. I guess.

155
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.680
I’ll try them later.

156
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.320
O Barrister.

157
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.920
I’m sorry for keeping you waiting

158
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.760
It’s alright

159
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.400
It’s alright

160
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.600
After her

161
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.760
I think I’ll prefer this one

162
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.320
Really?

163
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.680
Umhun.It says I’m confident. reliable and good looking.

164
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.240
That’s a compliment I heard.

165
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.760
You didn’t. Don’t flatter yourself

166
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.320
Just hurry up and make your selection

167
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:50.120
This one makes my hair look a bit pasty

168
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.280
Jide. is everything okay?

169
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.320
Is there something I need to know?

170
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.560
(Sigh)

171
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.960
You know what. I have to go.

172
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.520
I have to go right now.

173
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.200
We’ll pick this up later. okay?

174
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.800
Jide!

175
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.720
We’re outside live at the courthouse

176
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.480
of Barrister Madu to interview him

177
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.360
on another landmark victory.

178
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.400
Let’s go and hear what he has to say.

179
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.760
Hello Barrister Madu.

180
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.880
Well. I will say I’m delighted and I’m elated.

181
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.800
The judgement was in our favour…

182
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.560
You knew all of this and you kept them away from me.

183
00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.320
knowing what it could do to us.

184
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.480
to what we have built.

185
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.760
I’m sorry. I thought I had it handled.

186
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.440
Ah - you handled it.

187
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.520
Look at where we are now.

188
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.040
Well. at least you did something right.

189
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.920
You cloned her phone.

190
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.320
Yeah. that was good.

191
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.800
So what do I do now?

192
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.360
You don’t do anything!

193
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.040
Go back to your campaign.

194
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.280
Think about winning.

195
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.000
I will handle it.

196
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.680
I always knew that Hawa

197
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.280
was too self-righteous for her own good.

198
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:53.560
Sir. how are you handling it?

199
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.120
I will handle it my way

200
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.680
And by the way. Teni was asking after you

201
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.320
your campaign manager

202
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.560
she was concerned.

203
00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.560
What are you going to do. dad?

204
00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.839
Hawa means well. sir.

205
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.560
I’m sure that message she sent to her friend was innocent.

206
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.880
Maybe I’m even the one overreacting.

207
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.280
Ahhh. yes. I’m thinking.

208
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.800
Remember those pictures you brought to me in the office?

209
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.920
Your campaign pictures?

210
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.680
I think the one you’re wearing native.

211
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.920
that’s the best of the lot.

212
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.280
Yeah. it makes you look dependable.

213
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.520
You know our people

214
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.440
they love dependable.

215
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.640
Now go. don’t keep your campaign manager waiting.

216
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.160
Go ahead. Go on.

217
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.920
Wilson. we have a problem.

218
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.760
Everything you asked for is in there.

219
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.920
And I also added yesterday’s report.

220
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.640
Jerome. have you heard from Linda?

221
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.600
Linda

222
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.920
She’s not at work.

223
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.400
and I haven’t been able to reach her at all.

224
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.080
I asked the HR.

225
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.360
and they said she didn’t call in.

226
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.640
That’s so unlike Linda.

227
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.760
Hmm. that’s serious.

228
00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.440
So you haven’t heard anything.

229
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.440
Heard what?

230
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.280
Hawa

231
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.040
apparently. she got involved in an accident.

232
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.600
You know. the hit and run stuff.

233
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.960
I don’t even know about that.

234
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.120
but she’s in the hospital as I’m talking to you now.

235
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.600
Most of them are even planning

236
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.400
to go and see her after work.

237
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.520
That’s what I heard o.

238
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.840
Ah. yes!

239
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.000
Hawa

240
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.040
Good evening.

241
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.040
(Laughs) Good evening.

242
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.200
Your housekeeper let me in just before she left.

243
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.440
Sit down. sit down.

244
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.320
I came to see you.Sit down.

245
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.080
You know. I said to myself.

246
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.000
it’s been a while since we saw.

247
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.800
So why don’t I come over?

248
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.000
And that’s why I have come.

249
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
so that we can spend some really good time.

250
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.320
I think it’s really late.

251
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.480
Ah no. no. no.

252
00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.360
You see. time spent with family is never wasted

253
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.800
no matter how late.

254
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.480
And Hawa. you’re family.

255
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.800
Yes.

256
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.000
Now Jide told me about the unfortunate incident

257
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.520
that occurred the other day.

258
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.480
and how you were feeling so badly and all of that.

259
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.560
Well I’m sorry.

260
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.360
but you know it was an accident.

261
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.640
And accidents happen. they happen all the time.

262
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.720
And they can happen to anybody.

263
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.360
For instance. look at your friend

264
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.840
what’s her name?

265
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.360
Linda.

266
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.960
She had an accident and that’s life.

267
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.400
We just have to take life as it comes

268
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.800
and we go with it.

269
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.240
You understand.

270
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.800
Good. Good.

271
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.320
You see. because your husband Jide.

272
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.280
he has some very important days coming up.

273
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.360
O yes!

274
00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:11.000
And we need to stay solid behind him.

275
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
don’t you agree?

276
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.800
You see. we Pedros.

277
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.720
we always do that to one another.

278
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.080
And since you’re a Pedro - o yes you’re a Pedro!

279
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.720
So you will stay with us united

280
00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.480
so that he can succeed.

281
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.960
Yes?

282
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.040
Ah - good.

283
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.600
Ah. yes! Well.

284
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.840
I’m sorry to cut this visit short.

285
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.120
but I really have to go.

286
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.480
I just said let me come over and greet you.

287
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.480
spend time with and just talk about these things.

288
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.400
Now you must come to the house.

289
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.200
Tony.

290
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:57.880
My new chef. he cooks this incredible jollof rice

291
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.760
and goat meat - you need to come and taste.

292
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.240
Alright?

293
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.600
Good!

294
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.400
Now don’t worry.

295
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.640
I already called your husband.

296
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.840
He will be home soon.

297
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.920
I am glad I came.

298
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.200
Nice seeing you after a long time.

299
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:45.880
(Phone rings)

300
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.440
Hello

301
00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.880
What!

302
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.640
My wife?

303
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.560
Which hospital?

304
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.760
Okay. I’ll be right there.

305
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.480
I’m so sorry.

306
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.760
It’s already over.

307
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:20.200
Please don’t

308
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.320
I can’t live like this.

309
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.680
Don’t talk like this.

310
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.520
You know our baby is our future.

311
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:41.600
No. no.I’m not sure I want to have a baby.

312
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.600
I don’t want to have a baby with you.

313
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.000
The man you have become scares me. Jide.

314
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.920
Your father scares me.

315
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.800
I can’t live like this.

316
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.440
Well. it’s just the pain talking.

317
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.600
Don’t say anything you’re going to regret.

318
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.800
You’re going to be fine.

319
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.040
Look. what’s most important is

320
00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.640
that we love each other.

321
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.600
I can’t.

322
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.320
I can’t bring my child into this.

323
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.040
No. never.

324
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.440
Why are you talking like this?

325
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.760
Please. just leave me alone.

326
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.560
What?

327
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.120
Please.

328
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.360
Please - no.

329
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.600
Out.

330
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.000
Sir. please the patient needs to rest.

331
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.720
You can come back later. or maybe tomorrow.

332
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.760
Thank you.

333
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.320
Sir. good night.

334
00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.960
Hawa

335
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:13.320
Sir. thank you. sir. Good night.

336
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.480
Sir.

337
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.120
Hello

338
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.040
Good day. sir.

339
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.440
I thought this was my wife’s room

340
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.520
She left already

341
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.000
Left - left to where?

342
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.520
She said she was fine

343
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.080
and that she wanted to leave.

344
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.600
So we let her go.

345
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.440
You just let her go

346
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.480
you didn’t call anybody? No message. nothing?

347
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.920
Sir. this is not a prison cell.

348
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.800
And when the doctor advised her against it

349
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.080
and she didn’t listen. we had to let her go.

350
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.680
What kind of hospital are you people running?

351
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.160
Nurse. isn’t that the guy running for senator?

352
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.640
Yes. he’s the one

353
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.080
Sir

354
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.840
What do you mean you don’t know where she is?

355
00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:41.080
So. we were at the hospital and we had an argument.

356
00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.000
She wanted me to leave so I left.

357
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.720
And by the time I got back there.

358
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.920
she was gone.

359
00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.200
And now. her phones are switched off.

360
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.520
I don’t even know where else to look.

361
00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.880
Sir. just - we just lost a child.

362
00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.520
Get yourself together!

363
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.240
I’m sorry for your loss

364
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.280
but why cry over spilled milk?

365
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.360
Hmm?

366
00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.080
What we should be doing is

367
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.080
thinking how to get her very quickly

368
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.360
before she does something stupid.

369
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.240
Election is just around the corner.

370
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.200
I don’t need this kind of scandal

371
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.040
not now.

372
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.840
And that wife of yours. she’s clearly unhinged.

373
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.840
Okay. if she is in Lagos.

374
00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.200
we will get her.

375
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.480
Sir. I’ve actually looked everywhere.

376
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.520
I’ve called everyone.

377
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.960
I even called her mother.

378
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.680
And she..

379
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.880
You did what?

380
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.640
Are you so stupid?

381
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.000
You called the mom?

382
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.280
And I warned you.

383
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.240
I told you not to bring that girl into this family.

384
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.400
but you won’t listen.

385
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.640
I told you that she doesn’t belong here.

386
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.760
Now look. Look!

387
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.320
You were too mesmerised by her beauty

388
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.480
and too weak to see it.

389
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.720
Now I have to clear up this mess - again!

390
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.560
Sir. Hawa won’t do anything to jeopardise us.

391
00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.120
She loves me too much for that.

392
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:45.720
Sir. please.

393
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.800
Please. don’t do what you did to her friend.

394
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.160
What kind of monster do you take me for?

395
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.200
Hawa is family.

396
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.200
Wilson?

397
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.600
I didn’t forget.

398
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.400
and we still have two hours to go.

399
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.640
But we’re going to meet here first so I could brief you.

400
00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.920
Yeah I know.

401
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.040
I had a family emergency.

402
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.760
Listen I promise to be there

403
00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.120
so you can brief me on the way.

404
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.320
Okay. that could work

405
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.680
But you’ve been quite sketchy these past days.

406
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.320
Is there anything I need to know?

407
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.000
Look. if there is anything you need to know.

408
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.680
you will know.

409
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.600
I have to go

410
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.400
Hawa!

411
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.720
Ah no!

412
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.360
Relax. relax.

413
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.440
Get away from me.

414
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.520
It’s just me

415
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.240
What are you doing here?

416
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.480
I just want to talk to you.

417
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.440
I knew you were going to come and see Linda at some point.

418
00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.560
I just need one minute of your time.

419
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.640
Just one minute of your time. please.

420
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.480
Please. just one minute.

421
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.600
Look. I know I haven’t been the man you want me to be.

422
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.640
But that’s why I made up my mind.

423
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.480
I’m going to come out to the authorities.

424
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.440
I’m going to tell them

425
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.480
everything that happened that night.

426
00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.760
Look. I just want to be a better man for you.

427
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.920
You’re my life

428
00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.000
You’re everything to me.

429
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.040
All I want to do is keep you safe.

430
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.280
And I want to make sure you stay in my life.

431
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.840
We can figure this thing out.

432
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.880
Come home. Come home with me.

433
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.200
I love you.

434
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.920
I know this is hard for you.

435
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.600
but thank you.

436
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.600
Thank you so much.

437
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.560
Enough tears. Hawa.

438
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.400
Common. Stop it

439
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.760
We’re stronger than this.

440
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.880
I brought your smoothie.

441
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.040
I know it’s been a few days since you’ve had it.

442
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.680
Thank you

443
00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.680
You’re welcome

444
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.800
Mum?

445
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.040
What are you doing in my house?

446
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.120
Hawa. you don’t have to run.

447
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.560
We want to help you.

448
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:46.920
She’ll be okay.

449
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.280
don’t worry.

450
00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.760
She’ll be okay.

451
00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.320
This is everything you need to know

452
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.720
about the women’s leader.

453
00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.200
Yeye Atinuke Aribidesi.

454
00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.760
Jide

455
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.840
Sorry. what were you saying?

456
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.760
Look. you need to be focused.

457
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.760
Your mind needs to be here with me.

458
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.639
I promised your father

459
00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.280
I was going to get you into the senate

460
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.400
and I will.

461
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.920
Sorry. continue.

462
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.480
Like I was saying.

463
00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.320
this is everything you need to know about yeye.

464
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.080
We need her on our side.

465
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.320
She’s looking.

466
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.239
Let us keep her staring.

467
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.920
Please read it

468
00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.960
Please some…

469
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.320
Please help me please.

470
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.120
…Some please open the door!Please!

471
00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.520
Sir. the reporters from Channel 4 are here.

472
00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.280
I put them in the briefing room.

473
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.000
Okay. ehm. Thank you Gloria.

474
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.120
Hmm? And that is what we’re going to do.

475
00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.920
For you to go and talk to her

476
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.680
will mess up her mind.

477
00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.320
You know her mind is in a fragile state.

478
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.880
And we’re trying to limit physical contact.

479
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.000
So Hajia. just like I told you

480
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.840
she’s in the best possible place she can be in.

481
00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.800
I trust Doctor Haruna very much.

482
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.360
He’s the psychiatrist in the country.

483
00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.280
So you can just go back to Jos.

484
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.440
and don’t worry about it.

485
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.680
We’ll take care of her.

486
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.760
Don’t worry.

487
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.640
For God’s sake.

488
00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.280
When will I be able to see my daughter?

489
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.920
Mama Hawa. I can’t say precisely when.

490
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.480
But I want to assure you

491
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.840
we’re going to take good care of her until she improves.

492
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.320
And when she improves.

493
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.720
then we’re going to call the family members.

494
00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.480
Do you understand?

495
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.640
I will just remain in Lagos.

496
00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.400
I will go and stay in my sister’s place

497
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.880
at Agbado.

498
00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.640
I won’t go back until I see my daughter.

499
00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.560
Okay. No problem.

500
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.280
Thank you. doctor.

501
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.880
I was just on my own listening to them.

502
00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.320
I didn’t even bother wasting my strength

503
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.080
to see what they want to talk about.

504
00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.440
You know. all those stupid

505
00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.840
financial department guys.

506
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.640
looking for who to come and form form.

507
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.240
I don’t even have that strength.

508
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.120
I was even trying to see if I was going to…

509
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.360
Don’t tell me you haven’t been listening

510
00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.400
to what I was saying since.

511
00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.080
No. I’ve been listening.

512
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.800
Hmm

513
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.160
Okay.

514
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.040
No. I wasn’t listening.

515
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.640
I’ve been trying to reach Hawa since.

516
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.880
How has she been at work?

517
00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.360
Hawa has been on leave.

518
00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.040
Leave?

519
00:38:59.040 --> 00:38:59.760
How?

520
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.280
It’s not time for her to go on leave.

521
00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.520
What are you talking about?

522
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.120
That’s what they told us.

523
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.360
They told us she was on a medical leave.

524
00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.120
Lola from HR said her husband called.

525
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.320
She lost a child.

526
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.320
and she’s about leaving the country for a while

527
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.360
Are you okay?

528
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.040
Hey!

529
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.960
I’m fine. I just feel pain.

530
00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.000
Sorry.

531
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.640
I need to sleep.

532
00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.560
Okay. sorry.

533
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.840
Sleep. sleep.

534
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.040
Omo girl!

535
00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.640
James. I’ve told you.

536
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.880
This you scary pranks. I don’t like them.

537
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.520
So is that why you’re giving me attitude?

538
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.440
Okay. sorry.

539
00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.960
What do you want?

540
00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.000
I understand we have a VIP here

541
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
VIP?

542
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.400
Are you for real?

543
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.120
Obinna told me

544
00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.600
Dr Haruna wants to put you in charge of this room?

545
00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.920
Obinna talks too much.

546
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.240
He should learn to shut his mouth

547
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.160
What?!

548
00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.720
What’s wrong with you?

549
00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.440
What’s ‘what?’

550
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.400
Let me go in with you

551
00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.440
so we can see this VIP together.

552
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.320
If Mrs Beatrice catches you…

553
00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.000
What Mrs B?

554
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.680
The same one that is fast asleep?

555
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.480
Please open the door. let’s get in.

556
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.280
Hello

557
00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.880
Good afternoon

558
00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.880
and welcome to the news at 2.

559
00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.560
My name is John Adams

560
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.120
I understand she caught her husband

561
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.880
with the house girl in bed

562
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.840
And that was how she ran mad…

563
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.360
Are you sure?

564
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.920
Lawyer and activist.

565
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.320
Lawyer Alfred Madu’s daughter

566
00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.440
found dead after being missing for days.

567
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.800
According to source.

568
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.480
she was found in a pool of blood

569
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.600
after being knocked down

570
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.440
by a hit and run vehicle.

571
00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.400
However.

572
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.200
the police would like

573
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.040
any member of the public with useful information

574
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.200
regarding the ongoing investigation

575
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.200
to kindly report to the appropriate authorities.

576
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.560
The new refinery to built

577
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.800
in the city of Kaduna

578
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.560
in the city of Kaduna will proceed

579
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.440
after the association of surveyors of Nigeria…

580
00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.880
Hello. sir.

581
00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.400
Sir. have you seen the news?

582
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.800
The girl... the girl that died in the accident.

583
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.680
she’s on the news.

584
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.280
She’s Alfred Madu’s daughter?

585
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.640
This is bad. dad.

586
00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.440
This is really bad.

587
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:09.520
Hawa. you know. she was there and she...

588
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.640
And then. then after. what happens?

589
00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.960
Sir. we have a problem

590
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.080
Miss Linda?

591
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.360
Yes. who are you?

592
00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.160
Come with me.

593
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.280
Chief Pedro would like to have a word with you.

594
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.480
And what if I don’t want to come.

595
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.520
You can’t force me.

596
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.000
I will scream

597
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.080
and the whole neighbourhood will come running.

598
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.160
I won’t ask twice.

599
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.920
Linda.

600
00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.360
We’re not fighting. are we?

601
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.520
Forgive me sir.

602
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.240
But the last time I saw you

603
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.160
was at my friend’s wedding.

604
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.080
and now she’s gone MIA and...

605
00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.760
you’re in my house.

606
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.480
So many coincidences.

607
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.280
Linda.

608
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.440
My son told me about your outrageous claims

609
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.520
I’m sure you don’t want anyone to sue you

610
00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.840
you for defamation of character.

611
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.360
That means you have to sue the whole of Lagos State

612
00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.840
because people talk

613
00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.760
and I’m going to the police station with my evidence.

614
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.120
Linda. you’re a very smart girl.

615
00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.080
You know that the police will not listen to

616
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.720
any nonsense you say about me.

617
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.360
Look. Hawa is well.

618
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.080
She’s actually in the US.

619
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.800
recuperating from the loss of my grandchild.

620
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.560
This is a very trying time for the family.

621
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:50.120
Your friend is fine. I promise.

622
00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.520
She might even call you soon.

623
00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.280
Uhn?

624
00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.400
Ah. yes.

625
00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.920
Dangerous.

626
00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.160
Lagos could be a very dangerous place.

627
00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.520
Anything can happen to anybody.

628
00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.400
Anytime.

629
00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.480
Well. it’s nice seeing you again.

630
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.400
I hope next time.

631
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.960
it will be on a better circumstance.

632
00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.760
Hello

633
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.440
Hello

634
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.400
Obinna. stop!

635
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.320
You’ll put me in trouble one day.

636
00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.880
I’ve told. you - stop it.

637
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.040
What will happen to the food?

638
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.560
You know what?

639
00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.920
I will eat you instead.

640
00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.880
Come here

641
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.600
I don’t like it.

642
00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.360
I knew it!

643
00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.760
Both of you again!

644
00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.800
What have you turned this hospital into?

645
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.920
Oh. am I talking to myself?

646
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.560
No - Miss B.

647
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:15.320
I was just ehn… I was assisting her.

648
00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.320
Yes ma.

649
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.400
he was just assisting me.

650
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.240
I needed assistance.

651
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:23.800
Mr and Mrs Assistant.

652
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.920
Why don’t you save that for your query?

653
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:35.480
Now. get out.Get out!

654
00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.720
Imbecile!

655
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.120
And…

656
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.880
So nothing yet.

657
00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:25.480
No eyewitness. no suspect.nothing.

658
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.240
But there can’t just be nothing!

659
00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.520
She didn’t just kill her -!

660
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:41.200
Hello. I’m sorry I shouted.

661
00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.920
Okay. thank you.

662
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.520
Doctor!

663
00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.000
There is a big problem!

664
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.560
What is it. Brenda?

665
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.640
The Patient.

666
00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.840
the patient under my care is missing!

667
00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.320
The Pedro woman

668
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.960
Ah! This is not good!

669
00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.600
How did you allow this to happen?

670
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.760
I’m sorry.

671
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.440
I’ve alerted the guards.

672
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.720
They’re searching the premises.

673
00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.560
I’m sure they will come up with something.

674
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.480
Sorry is the least of our problems

675
00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:07.520
when the Pedros come down on us

676
00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.880
Hello sir. Chief.

677
00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.920
We have a problem

678
00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.400
Yes. she’s missing

679
00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:26.360
Please I really need to see him.

680
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.440
Please madam. it’s urgent

681
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.080
For the 20th time ma.

682
00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.880
he’s in a meeting.

683
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.040
Did you tell him it’s really serious?

684
00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.480
It’s a matter of life and death.

685
00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.640
Ma. please just sit down.

686
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.720
When the Barrister is done.

687
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.920
he will attend to you.

688
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.560
Thank you.

689
00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:04.040
Can I please get a pen and paper?

690
00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.960
I need to see him now.

691
00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.360
I told you that…

692
00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:02.400
No you won’t understand

693
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.760
Madam. you can’t do that!

694
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.120
Who are you!

695
00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:07.680
I’m so sorry I’m so sorry!

696
00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.960
Who is - who

697
00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.600
I need to talk to you right now.

698
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:11.600
What about?

699
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.640
I know what happened

700
00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.600
Who are you?

701
00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.200
Please. don’t let them take me

702
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.080
I’m not crazy.

703
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.200
No. no no!

704
00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.280
Don’t let them... No!

705
00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.400
Sorry about all this.

706
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.320
She just escaped from a mental facility.

707
00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.240
It happens all the time.

708
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.280
Yes boss.

709
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.600
Yeah. we have her

710
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.000
Alright sir. I will handle it.

711
00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.480
AdulSallam.

712
00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:53.360
I need your help. please.

713
00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.040
Okay

714
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:24.960
The lady was brought in here by her family.

715
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:25.880
So that we can give her

716
00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.880
all the best care we can give.

717
00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.240
And the only people authorised

718
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.320
to come and see her are her family members.

719
00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.520
You see. that lady is delusional.

720
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.480
And she’s here to get the best help

721
00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.560
that she can have.

722
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.360
Delusional. did you say. doctor?

723
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.280
Yes.

724
00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:47.160
Why don’t you leave that to me to judge?

725
00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.000
Doctor.

726
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.040
if you do not let me see that lady immediately.

727
00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.840
I will have every reporter.

728
00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:02.240
every TV house. policeman in this country.

729
00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.920
and even get you docked

730
00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.040
through a court injunction.

731
00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.880
And newspaper headlines will go agog tomorrow morning

732
00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:12.280
that you use this site as a hostage

733
00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.280
for kidnapped persons.

734
00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.760
And this place will be shut down faster

735
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.960
than you can say your name.

736
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.240
See. you can’t come here in my own facility

737
00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.800
to come and threaten me.

738
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.040
What will it be now. doctor?

739
00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.200
Nurse!

740
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.240
Nurse!

741
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:13.560
You’re a very hard woman to find.

742
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.640
You left this for me. right?

743
01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:44.400
I found it in my office

744
01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.200
the day you came around.

745
01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.160
I guess it was from you

746
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.560
I have a feeling I am not wrong.

747
01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.000
Madam. sorry I didn’t listen to you

748
01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.600
It must have taken a lot to escape

749
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.160
from this place to find me.

750
01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:29.360
It says here that

751
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.800
you know what happened to my daughter.

752
01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.240
Please talk to me

753
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.520
Who doesn’t want you to talk?

754
01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.080
What’s going on?

755
01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.360
Please talk to me.

756
01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.000
I know you can hear me.

757
01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.040
Adaeze.

758
01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.160
That was her name.

759
01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.520
She didn’t hurt anybody

760
01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.840
and didn’t deserve to die that way.

761
01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.240
She was my little girl.

762
01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.240
just on her way home.

763
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.080
I know you’re not crazy.

764
01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.760
And I can help you.

765
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.400
but you need to talk to me.

766
01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.920
Absolutely

767
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.680
We’ll definitely see you tomorrow

768
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.640
Alright. thank you.

769
01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.720
Bye bye.

770
01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.720
You were absolutely great today.

771
01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.960
And there’s no way Sholeye is winning this.

772
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.080
Thank you

773
01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.720
Well. just get me home

774
01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.040
and know that tomorrow is a big day.

775
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.280
Actually.

776
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.560
I have one more meeting

777
01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.560
to round up the night

778
01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.720
I’m meeting up with a friend of my dad’s.

779
01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:47.760
Okay

780
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.320
Yeah

781
01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.360
Whatever you do.

782
01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.160
make sure you get home on time.

783
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.400
have a good night rest.

784
01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.720
We have a big day tomorrow.

785
01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:54.680
For sure

786
01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.480
I didn’t want to leave her

787
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.280
I’m so sorry

788
01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.880
The door is open

789
01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.880
Hi. I’m supposed to have a meeting

790
01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.520
I know.

791
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.000
Jide Pedro?

792
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.560
I’m Sike.

793
01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.600
Come in.

794
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.680
Uhm. what’s going on?

795
01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.000
Come on. relax.

796
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.040
I don’t bite. except you want me to.

797
01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.320
Chief paid me generously

798
01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.720
to take good care of you.

799
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.680
Chief (Laughs)

800
01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.320
Okay

801
01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.120
He said you’ve been tense for a while.

802
01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.040
Hmmm.

803
01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.080
I’m here to help with that

804
01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.760
Ah

805
01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.160
(Laughs)Thank you.

806
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.400
Thank you very. very much.

807
01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.640
but I’m a married man.

808
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.760
Come on…

809
01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.840
I don’t judge.

810
01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.160
Married. single…

811
01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.200
I’m here to do my job.

812
01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.080
Come on. let’s go.

813
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.840
Uh. no thank you.

814
01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.200
Don’t be stubborn

815
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.280
No

816
01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.160
Here we are.

817
01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.880
Hawa. you’ll be safe here for now. okay?

818
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.280
So. you get some sleep.

819
01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.720
rest very well.

820
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.280
I’ll see you tomorrow.

821
01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.880
Thank you.

822
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.880
The key

823
01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.280
Thank you.

824
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.080
What do you mean she’s not here?

825
01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.000
I didn’t have much of a choice

826
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.920
Where’s she right now and who’s she with?

827
01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.680
Did my father transfer her out or here

828
01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.960
to stop me from seeing her?

829
01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.000
No.

830
01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.360
In fact. your father does not know.

831
01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.720
I didn’t know how to tell him.

832
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.960
So I had to tell you first

833
01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.800
so you’d break the news to him.

834
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.320
You know. your father is one of my greatest donors.

835
01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.160
Please that’s not what I want to hear.

836
01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.160
I want to know where my wife is.

837
01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.080
That’s what I want to know.

838
01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.120
Hmm. Between you and I. Jide.

839
01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:11.200
you know that your wife is very sane.

840
01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.560
I had the choice of letting her go

841
01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.320
or having this place swarmed

842
01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:24.840
by all sorts of reporters or police and even.

843
01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.920
there was a court injunction.

844
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.280
I had to let her go.

845
01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.880
You know.

846
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.800
I built this place to help people

847
01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.760
who are really in need of it.

848
01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:42.920
not to be a pawn to be used by family feud.

849
01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.080
What do you mean by that?

850
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.800
See. that lawyer.

851
01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.280
the one that your wife went to his office.

852
01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:01.720
He came here. making all sorts of threats.

853
01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.160
And you know that what we’re doing is illegal.

854
01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:12.400
So I had to let her go.

855
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.480
Just let her go.

856
01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.600
just like that.

857
01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.800
You’re going to pay for this. Doctor.

858
01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.200
He’s not here.

859
01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.240
And we’ve been waiting for 25 minutes.

860
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.360
Yeah. I know.It’s actually 28.

861
01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.200
I’m sure he will join us very soon.

862
01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.760
He should be on the way.

863
01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.520
Do you trust him?

864
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.399
I don’t trust anybody.

865
01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.559
But I know he’s a good man.

866
01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:55.639
Well. let’s just play on the good. for now.

867
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:09.920
He’s here. Good.

868
01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.160
Yeah. Thanks for coming. Abdulsallam.

869
01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:21.960
Thanks for coming.

870
01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.280
We appreciate.

871
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.319
This is -

872
01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:25.200
I know who she is.

873
01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.639
Ah. good.

874
01:09:26.639 --> 01:09:28.719
As at this morning.

875
01:09:28.719 --> 01:09:33.080
she is declared missing and unwell.

876
01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.639
The patrol teams are on the lookout.

877
01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:37.960
What!

878
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.600
I tried my best.

879
01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.120
But my bosses are not ready to

880
01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.600
get entangled with Pedro matter.

881
01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.479
And you know. I’m just a small fry.

882
01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:55.160
There’s nothing I can do.

883
01:09:55.719 --> 01:09:57.960
I thought you said he can help

884
01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.639
Yes. that is if it is within my capacity.

885
01:10:02.639 --> 01:10:04.440
I would have.

886
01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.040
Okay. let’s assume

887
01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.080
I invite her for statement in our station.

888
01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.600
Then I go ahead to arrest the Pedros.

889
01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.360
How many days do you think they will spend with us?

890
01:10:21.559 --> 01:10:24.600
Knowing well that they’re aware of your mental health

891
01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.680
It will even get the case thrown out

892
01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.800
faster than we say Donald Trump.

893
01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.280
I am not crazy!

894
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.080
I understand.

895
01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.800
I’m only telling the barrister.

896
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.200
And he’s aware of all these.

897
01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.840
Your father-in-law is very powerful.

898
01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.320
feared by everybody.

899
01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.920
Those who are not afraid of him are powerless.

900
01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.800
They can’t do anything.

901
01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.400
Look at what he did to you.

902
01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.320
his son’s wife.

903
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.600
He is the godfather here.

904
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.880
He’s going to stop at nothing protecting his son.

905
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:04.160
Not even now that election is around the corner.

906
01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:12.360
Uhm. Barrister.

907
01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.600
Yeah

908
01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.600
I’m very sorry.

909
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.760
I will advise you to live to fight another day.

910
01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.960
Fighting the Pedros

911
01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.920
will not bring back your daughter.

912
01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.960
It will only get you killed.

913
01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:34.200
I am sorry. I have to leave now.

914
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.719
I am sorry.

915
01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:38.960
It’s alright. Adulsallam.

916
01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.719
Thank you.

917
01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.480
Hey. stop pacing.

918
01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.000
You’ll dig a hole in the floor very soon.

919
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Sit down.

920
01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.960
She could be anywhere now.

921
01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.080
saying God knows what to whoever is willing to listen.

922
01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.040
How can you be so calm?

923
01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.840
It’s because I have everything under control.

924
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.880
I really hope

925
01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.600
someone hasn’t gone and done something to her.

926
01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.840
Get up.

927
01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.520
Stop that!

928
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.160
You are a Pedro.

929
01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.280
I have raised you better than this.

930
01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.320
Relax.

931
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:48.840
If you took my kind gesture.

932
01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.719
my good gesture at that time.

933
01:12:52.719 --> 01:12:55.800
you’d be more relaxed.

934
01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.800
I need a drink

935
01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.000
Stay away from the liquor.

936
01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:20.320
Sir. I tried to…

937
01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.160
I have to call you back

938
01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.120
Gloria. it’s alright.

939
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.080
Barrister. relax.

940
01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.000
This is just a friendly visit.

941
01:13:37.559 --> 01:13:40.559
Wilson. don’t worry about him.

942
01:13:40.559 --> 01:13:41.840
He’s an angel.

943
01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:47.120
He won’t do anything he doesn’t absolutely have to do.

944
01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.280
Otunba. what do you want?

945
01:13:51.440 --> 01:14:00.400
Well. uhm… Some news came to my hearing

946
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.600
a couple of days ago.

947
01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.520
very unfortunate news.

948
01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:11.960
And I thought maybe I should come and see you.

949
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.800
Unfortunate news?

950
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.760
Chief Pedro. your son killed my daughter

951
01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:31.120
and left her by the wayside like a trivial animal.

952
01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:38.880
Now you kept his wife in a mental hospital

953
01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.040
so that she wouldn’t be clean about what happened that night.

954
01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:47.719
And you Pedros think you are above the law.

955
01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:56.200
Otunba. I have nothing in common with you.

956
01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.760
And now.

957
01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.120
your own daughter-in-law is hiding

958
01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.520
scared for her life

959
01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.600
because she knows what you are capable of.

960
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.680
Barrister. I’m sorry that your daughter died.

961
01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.600
But that was an accident.

962
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.280
That could happen to anybody.

963
01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.719
And that’s why I’m here

964
01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.080
father to father.

965
01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.960
man to man.

966
01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.000
Your daughter died.

967
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.280
I want to compensate for that.

968
01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.559
You mention your price.

969
01:15:37.559 --> 01:15:41.760
and let me pay to ease your pain.

970
01:15:42.559 --> 01:15:44.960
Ease my pain

971
01:16:05.639 --> 01:16:09.160
Otunba. this is my daughter. Adaeze

972
01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:12.719
cut down in her prime.

973
01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:17.080
All that promising young life wasted.

974
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.080
Father to father?

975
01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:29.440
You’re a poor excuse of a man.

976
01:16:30.559 --> 01:16:32.960
talk more of a father.

977
01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.719
Otunba. you’re a coward.

978
01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:38.760
A coward who bullies people to get his way.

979
01:16:39.639 --> 01:16:44.000
I have nothing in common with you. Otunba Pedro.

980
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.800
absolutely nothing.

981
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.600
Get out.

982
01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.000
Leave my office.

983
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.639
Get out of my office.

984
01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.719
I came here and I offered you peace.

985
01:17:06.719 --> 01:17:10.160
but you just made the wrong choice.

986
01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.639
(Knock)

987
01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.600
(Knock)

988
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.719
Hawa. open please.

989
01:18:03.719 --> 01:18:05.840
It’s me. Madu.

990
01:18:10.559 --> 01:18:12.440
What’s wrong?

991
01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.240
You look flustered.

992
01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.040
Someone shot at my car.

993
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.639
Oh no. oh no!

994
01:18:17.639 --> 01:18:20.200
I know.

995
01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.760
Are you...

996
01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.600
I’m fine. I’m fine.

997
01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.200
It was just a warning. obviously.

998
01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.160
Yeah. that’s what I’m scared of.

999
01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.440
because next time. it won’t be a warning.

1000
01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.200
O relax. relax Hawa.

1001
01:18:37.559 --> 01:18:39.520
I don’t scare easily

1002
01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.440
Yeah. no. no.

1003
01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:45.200
I have good news.

1004
01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.880
My friend. Paul.

1005
01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.320
is a senior correspondent at Today’s News.

1006
01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.719
They’ll be running a front page pic tomorrow.

1007
01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.120
If they carry it. others will.

1008
01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.160
And if everything is in the open.

1009
01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.520
you’ll not have to hide any longer.

1010
01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.920
And seems like we will get justice. after all.

1011
01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.719
O my God!

1012
01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.680
That’s great news!

1013
01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.800
Yeah. it is.

1014
01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.360
Hello Paul

1015
01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.480
Hi Alfred.

1016
01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.240
I’m afraid I have some bad news.

1017
01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.719
My editor refuses to publish this story.

1018
01:19:59.719 --> 01:20:01.440
It was an agreement.

1019
01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:03.520
but he just called me an hour ago

1020
01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.440
that he can’t go ahead.

1021
01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.240
I tried to persuade him but won’t listen.

1022
01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:12.000
I talked to my people in News Today and dailies.

1023
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.080
no one wants to touch the story.

1024
01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:16.440
You know it’s the Pedros that run this town

1025
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.080
for over 30 years.

1026
01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.440
and everyone is scared of the fallback

1027
01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.600
. I’m so sorry. Alfred. I really wish I could help.

1028
01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:28.200
Thank you Paul.I appreciate.

1029
01:20:41.719 --> 01:20:44.120
O. thank you.

1030
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.040
Thank you very much.

1031
01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:13.520
Uhm. see.I’ve fought so many battles.

1032
01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:17.600
faced a lot of adversaries.

1033
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:24.639
Now. I can’t get justice for my own child.

1034
01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:36.200
I - I. I feel defeated.

1035
01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.000
Why? What’s wrong?

1036
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Otunba! Otunba Pedro controls the media.

1037
01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:46.240
Newspaper. television. radio.

1038
01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.440
He has media power.

1039
01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:57.840
But I think it’s not over yet.

1040
01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:01.440
We can do blogs. send something out.

1041
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.240
Make it trend.

1042
01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.800
You know. it can’t just be over.

1043
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.520
Hawa. that will just look like some cheap rumour.

1044
01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.920
Blogs.

1045
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:16.639
See. if only the real newspapers

1046
01:22:16.639 --> 01:22:20.680
and outlets will go with it.

1047
01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.520
then the people will pay attention.

1048
01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:49.320
How do you fight the devil?

1049
01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:05.480
How do you fight the devil?

1050
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:14.600
How do you fight the devil?

1051
01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:31.200
(Gunshot)

1052
01:24:22.639 --> 01:24:25.000
My God!

1053
01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.680
O. ma!

1054
01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:30.080
Breaking News!

1055
01:24:31.559 --> 01:24:32.800
O my goodness!

1056
01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.080
Wow!

1057
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.120
And he actually made it down to the interview.

1058
01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.000
Even with this.

1059
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.960
Should we still run it?

1060
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:45.559
Just wait till I’m done with my interview with him.

1061
01:24:45.559 --> 01:24:46.400
Okay. okay ma.

1062
01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.440
Let me give you a call back in a bit.

1063
01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.559
Excuse me. What’s going on?

1064
01:24:58.559 --> 01:25:01.639
We have just discovered about the demise

1065
01:25:01.639 --> 01:25:03.960
of Mr Jide’s wife.

1066
01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.120
O my God!

1067
01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.280
This is serious.

1068
01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:22.920
I’m so sorry about your loss

1069
01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:24.920
You must be so brave

1070
01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:27.160
to still make it down to the interview.

1071
01:25:27.639 --> 01:25:29.400
Just take heart. okay.

1072
01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.520
May Hawa’s soul rest in perfect peace.

1073
01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.920
I’m sorry.

1074
01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:40.400
Jide. I literally just found out.

1075
01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.040
I’m so sorry.

1076
01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:46.240
Jide. look. let’s just stop this interview.

1077
01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.680
Go home and sort things out.

1078
01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.600
(Sigh)

1079
01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.480
Say something.

1080
01:25:58.719 --> 01:26:00.120
No.

1081
01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.920
No. we have to do it.

1082
01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.800
We’re already here.

1083
01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.840
I don’t understand.

1084
01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.520
Maybe it will get me more sympathy with the voters.

1085
01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.080
You know. because

1086
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.520
Crime prevention is high on my manifesto.

1087
01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.800
I’m speechless.

1088
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:38.480
I’ve been groomed my whole life for this.

1089
01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.440
I’m gonna have to do it.

1090
01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:50.160
Come on. let’s do it.

1091
01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:00.639
On January 15. something happened.

1092
01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.840
My wife and I;

1093
01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:07.320
we were out celebrating.

1094
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.920
She had just gotten pregnant.

1095
01:27:12.639 --> 01:27:16.480
I was about to become a father for the first time.

1096
01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:25.840
We were driving along the expressway and

1097
01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:29.559
there was an accident

1098
01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:34.000
Today. in what seemed to be a turn of event.

1099
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.920
political aspirant. Jide Pedro.

1100
01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.600
son of the former senate president.

1101
01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.360
has turned himself in

1102
01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.960
for the wrongful killing of Adaeze Madu.

1103
01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.960
child of the human rights lawyer and activist.

1104
01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.840
Barrister Alfred Madu.

1105
01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:50.360
Sources have confirmed that

1106
01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.639
Chief Kayode Pedro has been arrested

1107
01:27:53.639 --> 01:27:56.480
for charges that include kidnapping. assault.

1108
01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.639
and attempted murder.

1109
01:27:58.639 --> 01:28:01.280
