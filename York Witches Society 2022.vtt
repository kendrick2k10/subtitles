3
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.673
The people have spoken.

4
00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:18.515
-Let me go!

5
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.122
-You've consorted with
demons.

6
00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:27.656
and borne their offspring!

7
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:31.198
I am compelled to
deliver your judgment.

8
00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:32.727
Heather Gray.

9
00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:34.729
-Shame on you!

10
00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:51.482
-One last chance.
Heather Gray.

11
00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:55.255
Confess. admit your sin.

12
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.521
You are the last witch
in England.

13
00:01:57.556 --> 00:02:00.359
You have consorted
with the devil.

14
00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:02.295
And then I will ease your pain.

15
00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:05.430
and slit your throat
before you burn.

16
00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:17.376
-You have a daughter.

17
00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:18.277
Think of her.

18
00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:20.808
I will find her.
and I will slaughter her.

19
00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:25.351
Won't you please
our young King James?

20
00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:27.683
Admit what you are.

21
00:02:27.718 --> 00:02:29.619
You have consorted with a demon.

22
00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:31.720
-It is time.

23
00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:33.887
The men I told you about.
they're coming.

24
00:02:33.922 --> 00:02:38.265
-Tell me where the child is.
and I will be lenient.

25
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.332
-The bad men?

26
00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:40.993
-Yes. the bad men.

27
00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:41.961
Never!

28
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:49.507
-Do not say I was unjust.

29
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.809
No!

30
00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:03.455
I'll find your spawn.
Gray.

31
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.721
if it's the last thing I do.

32
00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:08.295
I will follow you through Hell.

33
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.496
I will wipe your filthy
bloodline from this earth.

34
00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:15.368
-I curse you.

35
00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:19.900
Matthias Alistair.

36
00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:25.279
So long as a Gray walks
this land.

37
00:03:25.314 --> 00:03:26.610
Take this.

38
00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:27.908
The Goddess will keep you safe.

39
00:03:27.943 --> 00:03:32.517
.your soul is cursed
and forever damned.

40
00:03:32.552 --> 00:03:33.749
I curse you!

41
00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:40.492
I damn you to the hell
that is neither death nor life!

42
00:03:43.497 --> 00:03:47.697
I curse you!

43
00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:15.048
A's across the board. Chris.

44
00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:16.115
I swear it.

45
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.589
-You don't
need to convince me.

46
00:05:17.624 --> 00:05:19.591
Grades is the least
of my concerns.

47
00:05:19.626 --> 00:05:20.458
-Ah. yes. Here we go.

48
00:05:20.494 --> 00:05:22.396
The old "Don't
forget to socialize."

49
00:05:22.431 --> 00:05:25.729
-Making friends is an
important part of life. Amber.

50
00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:28.996
It hasn't been easy for you.
all this moving around.

51
00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:32.065
Now's your chance to form some
real bonds if you can just.

52
00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.971
I won't be here forever.

53
00:05:38.612 --> 00:05:40.139
-I should go.

54
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.844
-Wisdom
comes in many forms.

55
00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.747
Not just through study.

56
00:05:43.782 --> 00:05:45.419
You know.

57
00:05:45.454 --> 00:05:47.014
-I have to go.

58
00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:48.455
-I have something for you.

59
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.918
It's here somewhere.

60
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.196
-Chris. it's.

61
00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:05.703
-It's been a tradition
between mothers

62
00:06:05.738 --> 00:06:08.101
and daughters in your family
for generations.

63
00:06:09.742 --> 00:06:12.171
Your mother would have wanted
you to have it today.

64
00:06:14.747 --> 00:06:16.747
-Thank you.

65
00:06:16.782 --> 00:06:17.946
I'll make you proud.

66
00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:20.421
-You already have.

67
00:06:22.656 --> 00:06:24.051
Goodbye. Amber.

68
00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:52.882
-Hello.
-Hi!

69
00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:54.587
I'm Kirsten.

70
00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:55.522
Your roommate.

71
00:06:57.724 --> 00:06:59.823
-Hi. Oh. okay.
I'm Amber.

72
00:06:59.858 --> 00:07:00.890
I thought that I--

73
00:07:00.925 --> 00:07:02.793
-You thought
you had your own room.

74
00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:03.860
But this is cool. yeah?

75
00:07:03.895 --> 00:07:04.828
Sharing?

76
00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:07.127
-Yeah.

77
00:07:07.162 --> 00:07:08.062
-All the rooms here
are shared.

78
00:07:10.836 --> 00:07:12.033
Wow.

79
00:07:12.068 --> 00:07:13.837
I love your pendant.

80
00:07:24.047 --> 00:07:25.915
I didn't think
anyone was gonna come.

81
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.884
I mean. you have missed
all of Freshers week.

82
00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:31.954
Um. so have you
joined any clubs yet?

83
00:07:31.989 --> 00:07:32.955
-I just got here.

84
00:07:37.764 --> 00:07:39.192
Witches?

85
00:07:39.227 --> 00:07:41.898
-Yeah. it's my thing.

86
00:07:41.933 --> 00:07:45.836
Look. I have managed to
distill the perfect blend

87
00:07:45.871 --> 00:07:46.804
of social groups

88
00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:48.608
in order to support my
personal. creative.

89
00:07:48.643 --> 00:07:50.203
and social growth here.

90
00:07:50.238 --> 00:07:52.612
-That's crap.
You don't need that.

91
00:07:52.647 --> 00:07:54.240
-Yes.

92
00:07:54.275 --> 00:07:55.945
Yes. I do. Ambs.

93
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.013
I'm the first person in
my family to go to uni.

94
00:07:58.048 --> 00:08:01.687
That means I intend to network
the shit out of this place.

95
00:08:01.722 --> 00:08:03.854
I think I just about have
the balance right too.

96
00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:04.921
-Well. that's great.

97
00:08:04.956 --> 00:08:05.856
-All but one.

98
00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:11.730
The York Witches Society.

99
00:08:15.263 --> 00:08:16.262
The York what?

100
00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:18.572
-The preeminent
social group.

101
00:08:20.774 --> 00:08:22.103
They're playacting the witch's
thing for sure.

102
00:08:22.138 --> 00:08:23.874
but it is symbolic.

103
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:25.106
I mean. strong women
and all that.

104
00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:26.745
The elite.

105
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.142
They have influences
in all the key positions

106
00:08:28.177 --> 00:08:29.275
around the university.

107
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.112
They are the who's who of who.

108
00:08:34.788 --> 00:08:37.690
Entirely too exclusive
for the likes of me.

109
00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:39.120
-Sounds more like
the York Bitches Society

110
00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:40.154
if you ask me.

111
00:08:40.189 --> 00:08:41.595
But you do what you like.

112
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.321
I'm here to study.

113
00:08:55.402 --> 00:09:01.142
-♪ Her eyes seem to twinkle
With her smile ♪

114
00:09:01.177 --> 00:09:03.683
♪ She flips ♪

115
00:09:03.718 --> 00:09:04.550
-Heya. Do you wanna hang out?
-No.

116
00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:05.949
-♪ Her golden hair
as you walk by ♪

117
00:09:05.984 --> 00:09:08.820
-I mean. I'm working. so.
-♪ She's trying ♪

118
00:09:08.855 --> 00:09:09.754
-Great.

119
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:17.763
-♪ Desperately
To be the girl you need ♪

120
00:09:17.798 --> 00:09:21.866
♪ As sweet as candy. ♪

121
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:27.641
♪ Like candy. ♪

122
00:09:29.777 --> 00:09:31.777
-You're welcome.

123
00:09:31.812 --> 00:09:33.647
Gotta go. Film club.

124
00:09:33.682 --> 00:09:34.648
Wanna come?

125
00:09:34.683 --> 00:09:35.847
Okay. bye.

126
00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:44.053
<i> I'm really considering</i>
<i>dropping Dr. Cooper's class.</i>

127
00:09:44.088 --> 00:09:46.792
If it wasn't mandatory.
I'd have done it by now.

128
00:09:46.827 --> 00:09:48.288
-But we're just
getting to the exciting stuff.

129
00:09:48.323 --> 00:09:50.059
The Reformation.

130
00:09:50.094 --> 00:09:51.225
She is coasting. though.

131
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.326
-Coasting?
Understatement.

132
00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:54.560
She's phoning it in.

133
00:09:54.596 --> 00:09:58.298
Been trotting out the same
lectures for the past 20 years.

134
00:10:00.005 --> 00:10:01.070
-What is it?

135
00:10:01.105 --> 00:10:02.170
-It's them.

136
00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:07.813
The York Witches Society.

137
00:10:26.966 --> 00:10:28.999
-Well. that's the
saddest thing I've ever seen.

138
00:10:29.034 --> 00:10:30.231
Come on. let's get some lunch.

139
00:10:34.402 --> 00:10:35.907
I stand corrected.

140
00:11:05.137 --> 00:11:08.137
The<i> Malleus Maleficarum</i> .

141
00:11:08.172 --> 00:11:10.876
or<i> The</i> <i> Hammer of the Witch</i> .

142
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:16.750
A guide to finding. torturing
and exterminating witches.

143
00:11:16.785 --> 00:11:20.182
Followed closely by King
James's own book.<i> Demonologie.</i>

144
00:11:20.217 --> 00:11:23.955
which expanded on how witches
consorted with Satan

145
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.926
and kickstarted
the witch trials.

146
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:30.423
Thanks to the printing press.
it went viral.

147
00:11:33.329 --> 00:11:36.968
-Single mothers.
old women with dementia.

148
00:11:37.003 --> 00:11:40.070
disabled children.

149
00:11:40.105 --> 00:11:42.237
Oh. yes. there were
methods of torture

150
00:11:42.272 --> 00:11:46.241
and killing children and women
that have yet to be equaled.

151
00:11:46.276 --> 00:11:49.112
Burnings. savage beatings..

152
00:11:50.852 --> 00:11:55.184
This brings being stoned
to a whole new level.

153
00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:10.969
-Is that all you have to offer?

154
00:12:11.004 --> 00:12:16.139
-Well. I think we're just
about out of time here.

155
00:12:16.174 --> 00:12:17.207
-I said.

156
00:12:17.242 --> 00:12:19.780
-.is that all you have to offer?

157
00:12:22.884 --> 00:12:25.115
Some snide remarks?

158
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.118
This violence against--against
the innocent. against women.

159
00:12:28.153 --> 00:12:29.581
against anybody
who is different.

160
00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:31.858
Was different.

161
00:12:33.257 --> 00:12:34.190
Amber.

162
00:12:35.523 --> 00:12:36.929
is that Amber?

163
00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:40.900
This is history.

164
00:12:40.935 --> 00:12:43.100
I suggest
you read a few papers.

165
00:12:43.135 --> 00:12:48.171
and. uh. we can discuss
at your next seminar.

166
00:12:48.206 --> 00:12:49.238
Now.
-I've read your papers.

167
00:12:49.273 --> 00:12:50.503
Dr. Cooper.

168
00:12:50.538 --> 00:12:53.473
Your abysmally small body
of original work.

169
00:12:53.508 --> 00:12:54.641
I see from the date
of your last thesis

170
00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:58.247
that your academic achievements
are few and far between.

171
00:12:58.282 --> 00:13:00.920
In fact. it's been years
since something relevant

172
00:13:00.955 --> 00:13:03.054
to contemporary academia
or social change

173
00:13:03.089 --> 00:13:04.550
has come from your fingertips.

174
00:13:04.585 --> 00:13:09.555
You. Doctor. you dispense
the gruesome details of the past

175
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.029
like it's a shopping list.

176
00:13:11.064 --> 00:13:12.459
reeling off the blood and guts

177
00:13:12.494 --> 00:13:14.131
of the darkest time
in our history.

178
00:13:14.166 --> 00:13:17.233
and all you have to bring
is some tired jokes!

179
00:13:17.268 --> 00:13:19.499
By the end of this.
we will have learnt one thing:

180
00:13:21.943 --> 00:13:25.307
What true. dead social theories
and jaded academics look like.

181
00:13:51.973 --> 00:13:54.105
-Amber. are you okay?

182
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.008
Hey! Amber!

183
00:13:56.043 --> 00:13:56.976
Slow down.

184
00:13:58.111 --> 00:13:59.605
Quite a show.

185
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.639
I liked it.

186
00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.146
What'd you think?
-Yeah.

187
00:14:02.181 --> 00:14:04.115
Yeah. good show. Creepy Cooper.

188
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.149
-Pretty disrespectful.

189
00:14:05.184 --> 00:14:06.216
-Excuse me?

190
00:14:06.251 --> 00:14:08.053
-Ignore Jessica.
She's got no filter.

191
00:14:08.088 --> 00:14:10.253
Anyway. wanted to catch your ear
for a moment. Amber.

192
00:14:10.288 --> 00:14:11.221
We think you'd
make a great member

193
00:14:11.256 --> 00:14:12.651
of the York Witches Society.

194
00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:13.927
-No. thanks.

195
00:14:13.962 --> 00:14:14.694
-We'll definitely
think about it.

196
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.622
-Kate definitely
just meant Amber.

197
00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:19.394
-Even if I did want to
join your little teatime coven.

198
00:14:19.429 --> 00:14:22.364
which I don't. it'd be
both of us or nothing.

199
00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:24.267
-Think about it.

200
00:14:24.302 --> 00:14:26.104
-Amber Gray?
-Yeah?

201
00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:27.005
-Please come with me.

202
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.040
The dean would like
to speak with you.

203
00:14:30.638 --> 00:14:33.276
-Text Alanda. make sure
she's in that meeting.

204
00:14:35.016 --> 00:14:36.015
<i> At which point.</i>
<i>Dr. Cooper tells me</i>

205
00:14:36.051 --> 00:14:38.611
that she extricated herself
from the classroom

206
00:14:38.646 --> 00:14:40.019
for her own safety.

207
00:14:40.054 --> 00:14:41.218
-I was just
making a point.

208
00:14:41.253 --> 00:14:42.549
-Please. Miss Gray.

209
00:14:42.584 --> 00:14:44.221
I understand you are upset.

210
00:14:44.256 --> 00:14:46.520
but we cannot allow
our students here at Lilith

211
00:14:46.555 --> 00:14:49.457
to feel it is appropriate
to threaten a professor.

212
00:14:51.263 --> 00:14:53.593
-I'm not upset.

213
00:14:53.628 --> 00:14:56.035
Dean Rathbone.
I did not threaten her.

214
00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.003
I merely mentioned--

215
00:14:57.038 --> 00:15:00.270
-I really have limited options
here. Amber.

216
00:15:00.305 --> 00:15:03.669
Some of the faculty board have
already mentioned suspension.

217
00:15:03.704 --> 00:15:06.606
A few of our hottest heads have
called to talk about expulsion.

218
00:15:06.641 --> 00:15:08.575
-Bloody hell.
that was quick.

219
00:15:10.414 --> 00:15:12.678
Please. Dean.
you must understand.

220
00:15:12.713 --> 00:15:14.383
I was only--

221
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:17.386
-Dean?
-Alanda.

222
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:19.289
-Just heard what happened.

223
00:15:20.688 --> 00:15:21.587
Hey. Amber.

224
00:15:21.623 --> 00:15:23.458
-I've just been
pointing out to Miss Gray

225
00:15:23.493 --> 00:15:25.163
that this behavior will not do.

226
00:15:25.198 --> 00:15:26.263
-Hmm.

227
00:15:26.298 --> 00:15:27.561
-As president
of the Student Union.

228
00:15:27.596 --> 00:15:29.662
do you have any comment?

229
00:15:29.697 --> 00:15:32.368
-Well. Miss Gray
is new to the college. Dean.

230
00:15:32.403 --> 00:15:35.767
so I think some leniency
should be shown.

231
00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:39.111
I propose that I take
Miss Gray under my wing.

232
00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:41.575
Introduce her to
the York Witches Society.

233
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.741
We can show her the ropes

234
00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:45.348
and what's acceptable here
at Lilith.

235
00:15:45.383 --> 00:15:47.053
-You've got to be
kidding me.

236
00:15:47.088 --> 00:15:49.154
-Be quiet. please.

237
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:51.684
-If Miss Gray agrees
to help with our preparation

238
00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:55.127
for the upcoming Samhain
celebration.

239
00:15:55.162 --> 00:15:58.196
I think you could
consider her redeemed.

240
00:15:58.231 --> 00:15:59.461
Oh. we have a meeting tonight.

241
00:15:59.496 --> 00:16:01.232
W-we can bring her
into the fold.

242
00:16:02.466 --> 00:16:04.301
-It's settled.

243
00:16:04.336 --> 00:16:06.402
Thank you. Alanda.

244
00:16:06.437 --> 00:16:09.207
Okay. leave.

245
00:16:09.242 --> 00:16:12.078
-What?
I don't get a say in this?

246
00:16:12.113 --> 00:16:15.741
-The Burning Belle.
tonight.- 30.

247
00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:17.281
Don't be late.

248
00:16:18.614 --> 00:16:22.517
-I am an alumna
of the YWS myself. Miss Gray.

249
00:16:22.552 --> 00:16:25.421
It is exactly
the right thing for you.

250
00:16:25.456 --> 00:16:27.225
You have potential. Miss Gray.

251
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.556
Don't throw it away.

252
00:16:39.503 --> 00:16:41.404
-Shit. then.
How'd you guys get in here?

253
00:16:41.439 --> 00:16:42.570
How'd you get
to have your own room?

254
00:16:43.705 --> 00:16:44.770
-Well?

255
00:16:48.116 --> 00:16:49.445
-Well. I said
we'll look after her.

256
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.776
Show her the ropes and all that.

257
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:52.382
And Boney agreed.

258
00:16:52.417 --> 00:16:53.581
-You don't mean join us.

259
00:16:53.616 --> 00:16:55.220
-Why not?

260
00:16:55.255 --> 00:16:56.518
Because we don't know
anything about her.

261
00:16:56.553 --> 00:16:58.256
She could be anybody.

262
00:16:58.291 --> 00:16:59.587
-Oh. come on.

263
00:16:59.622 --> 00:17:02.095
She is cut out for greatness.

264
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.261
Isn't that what we want?

265
00:17:03.296 --> 00:17:04.427
-Yes.
-I like her.

266
00:17:04.462 --> 00:17:06.132
-But not at any price.

267
00:17:06.167 --> 00:17:08.431
-She's a loner.
I'm with Jessica.

268
00:17:08.466 --> 00:17:10.268
-We were blown away
by whatever she did

269
00:17:10.303 --> 00:17:11.434
in there with Cooper.

270
00:17:11.469 --> 00:17:12.600
Charlotte's right.

271
00:17:12.635 --> 00:17:14.470
I think she'd be perfect for us.

272
00:17:14.505 --> 00:17:15.669
-Let's test her.

273
00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:17.176
See if she really
has what it takes.

274
00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:18.705
-Hmm. but not
her runt of a friend.

275
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.805
Okay.
so let's vote on it.

276
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.477
But what about Kirsten?

277
00:17:21.512 --> 00:17:23.875
Kate. we're supposed
to always be seven.

278
00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.283
-Kirsten
won't pass the test.

279
00:17:26.583 --> 00:17:27.516
-All in favor?

280
00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:41.497
Good.

281
00:17:41.532 --> 00:17:42.164
Because I already told them
where the gathering is.

282
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.434
Now. you lot gots to bounce.

283
00:18:14.895 --> 00:18:18.765
-Yep. this is it.
The Burning Belle.

284
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.305
This just gets better.

285
00:18:41.658 --> 00:18:42.591
After you.

286
00:19:12.491 --> 00:19:13.424
Bloody hell.

287
00:19:13.459 --> 00:19:14.491
-Sorry.

288
00:19:16.726 --> 00:19:18.759
They're about to begin.

289
00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:25.931
-That's Jess's brother. Rob.

290
00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:27.537
-Oh. we'd almost
given up on you.

291
00:19:27.572 --> 00:19:28.967
Just stay there.

292
00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:31.739
-Sorry we're late.
-Be quiet.

293
00:19:31.774 --> 00:19:33.279
Wait there.

294
00:19:33.314 --> 00:19:35.809
Don't speak.

295
00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.684
-As the empires of men
rise and fall.

296
00:19:42.719 --> 00:19:44.620
we. the York Witches Society.

297
00:19:44.655 --> 00:19:47.293
have been tasked with
the preservation of knowledge

298
00:19:47.328 --> 00:19:49.559
and power breathed
into the earth

299
00:19:49.594 --> 00:19:51.330
by the Goddess.

300
00:19:51.365 --> 00:19:53.497
-As surely
as the sun brings the dawn

301
00:19:53.532 --> 00:19:56.027
and the moon keeps vigil
in the night sky.

302
00:19:56.062 --> 00:19:59.833
the YWS will bring order
and goodness to York.

303
00:19:59.868 --> 00:20:02.440
to Britain. to the world.

304
00:20:07.546 --> 00:20:09.315
-Balance through judgment.

305
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.877
-Excellence
through commitment.

306
00:20:10.912 --> 00:20:12.813
-Peace through fairness.

307
00:20:12.848 --> 00:20:14.947
-Love through sisterhood.

308
00:20:14.982 --> 00:20:17.983
-Amber Gray.
Kirsten Childerson.

309
00:20:18.018 --> 00:20:22.361
we have deemed you women
of stature and social merit.

310
00:20:22.396 --> 00:20:25.958
From this moment. worlds of
opportunity lay before you.

311
00:20:25.993 --> 00:20:29.731
Doors of prosperity
may open in your path.

312
00:20:29.766 --> 00:20:31.799
Unending influence can be yours.

313
00:20:31.834 --> 00:20:33.933
should you but choose
to take up your mantle

314
00:20:33.968 --> 00:20:36.342
as a member of
the York Witches Society.

315
00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:41.512
Are you prepared to
undergo the three trials?

316
00:20:41.547 --> 00:20:43.481
Witches. are you prepared to--

317
00:20:43.516 --> 00:20:45.846
-I am.
-I said don't speak.

318
00:20:45.881 --> 00:20:49.322
-This is the most
ridiculous thing I've ever seen.

319
00:20:49.357 --> 00:20:51.357
-For heaven's sake. Jess.
get the lights.

320
00:20:52.888 --> 00:20:54.756
You might think
this is a joke.

321
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:56.791
But if you don't at least
respect the tradition

322
00:20:56.826 --> 00:20:59.695
held by this group
for the last 400 years.

323
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.059
we'll make sure
the dean hears about it.

324
00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:02.127
Easy. Flora.

325
00:21:02.162 --> 00:21:03.963
Amber. I know it's
your first year here

326
00:21:03.998 --> 00:21:05.503
and you think you're all that.

327
00:21:05.538 --> 00:21:06.735
but I really wouldn't
take this opportunity

328
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.935
to join us for granted.

329
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:09.837
Isn't that right. Kirsten?

330
00:21:11.379 --> 00:21:14.710
-I mean. I'm sure
Amber's just adjusting.

331
00:21:14.745 --> 00:21:16.415
-No. I really
think it's all horseshit.

332
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:17.515
The thing is. Amber.

333
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.649
we take this very seriously.
okay?

334
00:21:19.684 --> 00:21:22.080
So. all you have to do
is go along with it

335
00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:23.653
for a couple of nights.

336
00:21:23.688 --> 00:21:27.019
and then you and your shadow
here are off the hook.

337
00:21:27.054 --> 00:21:28.394
Okay?

338
00:21:28.429 --> 00:21:29.923
-Plus. I went out
on a limb for you.

339
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.992
Boney will kick you out.
you know.

340
00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:38.635
-Yeah. Okay. Fine.

341
00:21:40.672 --> 00:21:41.838
Lovely.

342
00:21:41.873 --> 00:21:43.904
Well then. you won't mind if
we carry on the traditional

343
00:21:43.939 --> 00:21:46.643
initiation necessities tomorrow
night then. will you?

344
00:21:47.811 --> 00:21:49.778
-I suppose not.

345
00:21:49.813 --> 00:21:51.109
-Tomorrow night.

346
00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:53.782
Eleven forty-five p.m..
the college grounds.

347
00:21:56.556 --> 00:21:58.457
-Shall we get back
to college. actually?

348
00:21:58.492 --> 00:22:00.624
I think the union bar
closes at eleven.

349
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:40.629
One of the first tasks

350
00:22:40.664 --> 00:22:42.567
for every new witch
to accomplish

351
00:22:42.602 --> 00:22:44.668
is one of courage.

352
00:22:44.703 --> 00:22:45.603
The mallet.

353
00:22:48.476 --> 00:22:49.838
As per tradition.

354
00:22:49.873 --> 00:22:51.774
the new witch will strike
the old college bell

355
00:22:51.809 --> 00:22:54.040
and shout their name.

356
00:22:54.075 --> 00:22:55.107
All without getting caught.

357
00:22:57.584 --> 00:22:58.649
You ready?

358
00:23:17.769 --> 00:23:19.868
-Kirsten Childerson!

359
00:23:19.903 --> 00:23:23.476
Kirsten Childerson!

360
00:23:43.696 --> 00:23:45.157
-Amber Gray--ow!

361
00:24:05.047 --> 00:24:06.915
-Hey!

362
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.049
Get down!

363
00:24:09.084 --> 00:24:10.589
-Louder. bitch!

364
00:24:16.993 --> 00:24:18.696
-Amber Gray!

365
00:24:26.838 --> 00:24:28.134
-Come on. Amber!

366
00:24:28.169 --> 00:24:29.542
Put some gusto into it!

367
00:24:29.577 --> 00:24:31.643
We can hardly hear you!

368
00:24:36.683 --> 00:24:40.784
-Amber Gray! You dumb witches!

369
00:24:45.252 --> 00:24:47.626
Hey. Who's there?!

370
00:24:47.661 --> 00:24:49.826
This is private property!

371
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.190
Come on. Flora!

372
00:25:24.225 --> 00:25:25.664
I'll catch you up.

373
00:25:25.699 --> 00:25:26.929
The Burning Belle!

374
00:25:26.964 --> 00:25:28.766
Tomorrow night at- 30!

375
00:25:28.801 --> 00:25:30.097
Don't be late!

376
00:25:49.349 --> 00:25:50.656
Oh. perfect.

377
00:26:28.058 --> 00:26:28.991
Hello?

378
00:26:31.325 --> 00:26:32.258
Jessica?

379
00:26:34.229 --> 00:26:35.228
Charlotte?

380
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:40.365
Oh. god. Okay.

381
00:27:09.737 --> 00:27:10.428
Who's there?

382
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.201
Who's there?

383
00:27:22.277 --> 00:27:24.013
Who's there?

384
00:27:24.048 --> 00:27:25.377
Help! Stop!

385
00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.476
Anyone?

386
00:27:58.511 --> 00:28:01.017
I'm calling the police!

387
00:28:35.482 --> 00:28:39.418
-This used to be
the gallows. literally.

388
00:28:39.453 --> 00:28:42.058
until our great-great-great
grandfather

389
00:28:42.093 --> 00:28:44.291
took over
as the local constable.

390
00:28:44.326 --> 00:28:46.898
He didn't like seeing
dead thieves or witches

391
00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:49.362
hanging or burning
for all to see.

392
00:28:49.397 --> 00:28:50.935
Nobody comes here now.

393
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:51.936
Jess?

394
00:28:51.971 --> 00:28:53.003
-No. thanks.

395
00:28:53.038 --> 00:28:54.268
-Not for me either. thanks.

396
00:28:54.303 --> 00:28:56.468
-I don't do business
with new folks

397
00:28:56.503 --> 00:28:59.911
until I've had at least
one drink with them.

398
00:28:59.946 --> 00:29:01.209
-I'll come back
to town with you.

399
00:29:01.244 --> 00:29:02.980
I need to pick up
a few things for tonight.

400
00:29:03.015 --> 00:29:05.081
And I'll find out why
Flora hasn't turned up yet.

401
00:29:05.116 --> 00:29:06.049
-Okay. y'all.

402
00:29:07.547 --> 00:29:11.285
-Ooh.
Don't mind if I do.

403
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.485
-If you fancy a fire.
there's plenty of wood outside.

404
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.487
and there's an axe
here somewhere.

405
00:29:16.996 --> 00:29:18.325
-What's with the lights?

406
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.425
We're off the grid out here.

407
00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.328
There's a genny round the back.

408
00:29:21.363 --> 00:29:22.428
Come on. Jess.
It's now or never.

409
00:29:22.463 --> 00:29:25.200
-I'll be back.
An hour tops.

410
00:29:25.235 --> 00:29:27.367
Okay. Are we
doing this or what?

411
00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.911
-Let's get this over with.

412
00:29:32.946 --> 00:29:34.913
-Come on.
It's gonna be great.

413
00:29:51.558 --> 00:29:52.832
-Okay.

414
00:29:54.231 --> 00:29:56.198
I'll make the first one.

415
00:29:56.233 --> 00:29:57.903
And then you make
the rest of them.

416
00:29:57.938 --> 00:29:58.904
-Okay.

417
00:30:22.094 --> 00:30:23.027
-Seven.

418
00:30:24.096 --> 00:30:25.062
-Seven.

419
00:30:26.263 --> 00:30:28.901
-That's it?
That's the trial?

420
00:30:28.936 --> 00:30:30.969
You dragged me away
from study for this?

421
00:30:31.004 --> 00:30:32.498
This is the rest
of the trial.

422
00:30:32.533 --> 00:30:34.368
Your task is knowledge.

423
00:30:34.403 --> 00:30:37.569
You must learn all key facts
and spells before midnight.

424
00:30:37.604 --> 00:30:38.537
-Why midnight?

425
00:30:38.572 --> 00:30:41.012
-Well. that's when
we come back to test you.

426
00:30:41.047 --> 00:30:44.147
And if you pass. you're in.

427
00:30:44.182 --> 00:30:47.216
You make the dolls.
and you learn the craft.

428
00:30:47.251 --> 00:30:48.514
It's important for tonight.

429
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:50.615
-Yay. What's tonight?

430
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.419
-The Samhain.

431
00:30:52.454 --> 00:30:53.926
-Impressive.

432
00:30:53.961 --> 00:30:55.323
-Halloween?

433
00:30:55.358 --> 00:30:58.359
This is all some
Halloween party game?

434
00:30:58.394 --> 00:30:59.998
Come on. Kirsten.
We're out of here.

435
00:31:00.033 --> 00:31:01.362
This is kids' stuff.

436
00:31:01.397 --> 00:31:03.232
-Feast of the Dead. Samhain.

437
00:31:03.267 --> 00:31:06.202
All Saints and All Souls.
This is a special night.

438
00:31:06.237 --> 00:31:07.170
I'm staying.

439
00:31:07.205 --> 00:31:08.237
-Great.

440
00:31:08.272 --> 00:31:09.634
I'll leave you to it then.

441
00:31:22.418 --> 00:31:23.989
-This place
gives me the creeps.

442
00:31:34.199 --> 00:31:35.132
What's that noise?

443
00:31:44.572 --> 00:31:47.144
Oh. great.
An indoor pool.

444
00:32:13.469 --> 00:32:14.765
-Where are you. Flora?

445
00:32:49.373 --> 00:32:50.702
Let's see.

446
00:32:53.377 --> 00:32:54.640
Oy. I've just made those.

447
00:32:54.675 --> 00:32:56.312
Get them out.
I'm not doing them again.

448
00:32:58.778 --> 00:33:00.316
-All right.

449
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:01.581
Then you can
turn me into a toad.

450
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.394
"Light the sage--"

451
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.795
Amber?

452
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.500
Amber?

453
00:33:19.535 --> 00:33:20.534
Ambs?
-Yeah?

454
00:33:20.569 --> 00:33:22.107
Uh. I'm listening. What?

455
00:33:24.309 --> 00:33:28.080
-"Light the sage
and guide it right; by door--"

456
00:33:28.115 --> 00:33:30.214
--"and window
cleanse the light."

457
00:33:30.249 --> 00:33:32.744
-Wait. that's not a spell.
It's a nursery rhyme.

458
00:33:32.779 --> 00:33:33.811
-What nursery rhyme?

459
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.124
Okay. let's try this one.

460
00:33:39.159 --> 00:33:42.457
"I call to the Goddess with
sandalwood and brightest ribbon.

461
00:33:42.492 --> 00:33:44.657
"waxing fast
and holding strong.

462
00:33:44.692 --> 00:33:46.461
"gently soothe
this fevered brow

463
00:33:46.496 --> 00:33:47.561
whereupon my--"
-"Whereupon my

464
00:33:47.596 --> 00:33:50.366
energy is safest now."

465
00:33:50.401 --> 00:33:53.600
Yeah. these aren't spells.
They're nursery rhymes.

466
00:33:53.635 --> 00:33:56.339
-Amber. how on earth
do you know this stuff?

467
00:33:56.374 --> 00:33:57.274
-Show me the book.

468
00:34:03.381 --> 00:34:05.678
-Okay.
let's try this one.

469
00:34:05.713 --> 00:34:09.352
"I invoke the Goddess"--invoke!

470
00:34:09.387 --> 00:34:11.717
"I invoke the Goddess
to touch this charm

471
00:34:11.752 --> 00:34:14.126
"wherefrom my mother
it was born. and

472
00:34:14.161 --> 00:34:15.360
Goddess be my light--"
-"Goddess be my light.

473
00:34:15.396 --> 00:34:19.791
"Help to keep me safe as the
shadows fall upon me this night.

474
00:34:19.826 --> 00:34:21.892
"I invoke the Goddess
to touch this charm

475
00:34:21.927 --> 00:34:23.861
"wherefrom my mothers
it was born.

476
00:34:23.896 --> 00:34:26.567
"and Goddess be my light.

477
00:34:26.602 --> 00:34:29.240
He-as
shadow-s night."

478
00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.647
What's going on
down there?

479
00:34:40.682 --> 00:34:42.451
Are you two okay?

480
00:34:42.486 --> 00:34:44.684
-Yeah. yeah. we're okay.

481
00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.422
Um. we're freezing.

482
00:34:46.457 --> 00:34:47.885
Ca--ca--can you put
the heating on.

483
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.294
or get us a sweater
or something?

484
00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:51.195
Hang on.

485
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.429
I think I've got something
in the car.

486
00:34:59.371 --> 00:35:01.239
-You want to
talk about it?

487
00:35:01.274 --> 00:35:02.207
-No.

488
00:35:34.307 --> 00:35:37.605
-Hey. it's only me.

489
00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.904
-God. what are you doing
creeping up on me like that?

490
00:35:39.939 --> 00:35:41.675
I wasn't creeping.

491
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:43.776
I can only go so fast
with this pile.

492
00:35:43.811 --> 00:35:45.943
Here. take the axe.

493
00:36:21.585 --> 00:36:23.783
-You say nothing.
understand?

494
00:36:23.818 --> 00:36:26.786
-I won't. But come on. you know
something happened.

495
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:29.591
You must have
some kind of power.

496
00:36:29.626 --> 00:36:30.724
You're a witch.

497
00:36:30.759 --> 00:36:31.989
-What?

498
00:36:32.024 --> 00:36:33.562
-I knew the moment I saw you.
That pendant.

499
00:36:33.597 --> 00:36:35.267
-That is the most
ridiculous thing you ever said.

500
00:36:35.302 --> 00:36:36.598
And you said
a lot of ridiculous things.

501
00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:37.995
-But we have to find out.

502
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.029
We have to do something.

503
00:36:39.064 --> 00:36:40.602
See what powers you have.
-Stop!

504
00:36:40.637 --> 00:36:42.340
You are letting this stuff
get to your head.

505
00:37:03.891 --> 00:37:05.528
-"What is wanted is not
the will to believe but--"

506
00:37:05.563 --> 00:37:06.727
-If you don't
stop this right now--

507
00:37:06.762 --> 00:37:08.498
-"but the will
to find out."

508
00:37:08.533 --> 00:37:09.499
Don't you want to know?

509
00:37:09.534 --> 00:37:10.533
-Shut up. okay?

510
00:37:10.568 --> 00:37:11.831
If you breathe a word of this.

511
00:37:11.866 --> 00:37:12.931
I'm not a witch.

512
00:37:27.981 --> 00:37:29.717
What happened
was some kind of. you know.

513
00:37:29.752 --> 00:37:31.521
collective hysteria.

514
00:37:31.556 --> 00:37:33.050
Like moving statues
or apparitions.

515
00:37:33.085 --> 00:37:35.360
-This is fantastic. Ambs.

516
00:37:37.727 --> 00:37:40.090
Don't touch me!
I've told you before. okay?

517
00:37:40.125 --> 00:37:41.366
I don't need you.

518
00:37:41.401 --> 00:37:42.400
I don't need friends.

519
00:37:42.435 --> 00:37:43.995
I don't need anybody.

520
00:37:47.902 --> 00:37:50.001
-What about Flora?

521
00:37:50.036 --> 00:37:52.509
-I couldn't find her.

522
00:37:52.544 --> 00:37:54.511
-We'll have to
start without her.

523
00:37:59.012 --> 00:37:59.912
Let's begin.

524
00:38:01.784 --> 00:38:03.355
<i> I'm going through</i>
<i>with this farce ceremony</i>

525
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.357
to get the bloody thing
out of the way.

526
00:38:05.392 --> 00:38:07.986
I just want to get back to
my studies and on with my life.

527
00:38:09.627 --> 00:38:11.561
And you're only here
because of me. remember?

528
00:39:17.497 --> 00:39:18.397
-Welcome all.

529
00:39:20.027 --> 00:39:21.433
Kirsten Childerson.

530
00:39:22.667 --> 00:39:23.930
step forward. please.

531
00:39:26.165 --> 00:39:28.968
Amber Gray.
step forward. please.

532
00:39:32.105 --> 00:39:34.545
As the empires of men
rise and fall.

533
00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.811
we. the York Witches Society.
have been tasked

534
00:39:36.846 --> 00:39:39.847
with the preservation
of knowledge and power.

535
00:39:39.882 --> 00:39:42.553
breathed into the earth
by the Goddess.

536
00:39:42.588 --> 00:39:44.786
-As surely as
the sun brings the dawn

537
00:39:44.821 --> 00:39:47.657
and the moon keeps vigil

No. Something else.

566
00:41:25.922 --> 00:41:28.824
A spell for this special night.

567
00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:31.794

00:42:08.162 --> 00:42:10.063
The earth quakes at my word.

580
00:42:10.098 --> 00:42:11.834
The mighty Goddess is within me

581
00:42:11.869 --> 00:42:13.902
and I compel evil
this night and forever

582
00:42:13.937 --> 00:42:16.300
to show your face
so that you may be shamed.

583
00:42:16.335 --> 00:42:18.907
The Goddess has spoken.

584
00:42:42.966 --> 00:42:44.097
What was that?

585
00:42:50.974 --> 00:42:51.840
This place is so drafty.

586
00:42:51.875 --> 00:42:55.746
The wind just picks up.
It's a vortex.

587
00:42:55.781 --> 00:42:56.813
Honestly. Jessica.

588
00:42:56.848 --> 00:42:57.714
if you're
bringing people out here.

589
00:42:57.749 --> 00:43:00.883
you should really
get this place fixed up.

590
00:43:00.918 --> 00:43:01.884
-Are we done here?

591
00:43:05.791 --> 00:43:09.056
-She said
all souls. not demons!

592
00:43:09.091 --> 00:43:10.728
I mean.
I don't know about you lot.

593
00:43:10.763 --> 00:43:13.423
but I'm bloody starving.

594
00:43:13.458 --> 00:43:14.358
Let's eat.

595
00:43:20.003 --> 00:43:21.002
-Let's have some fun.

596
00:43:41.959 --> 00:43:45.389
-The only Latin I remember
is vacca stulta.

597
00:43:48.933 --> 00:43:50.328
I don't get it.

598
00:43:50.363 --> 00:43:53.298
-No. Of course.

599
00:43:53.333 --> 00:43:55.399
Amber. where did you
go to school?

600
00:43:55.434 --> 00:43:58.006
-I moved. A lot.

601
00:43:58.041 --> 00:44:01.812
I can say "goodbye"
in 20 languages.

602
00:44:01.847 --> 00:44:03.748
Okay. my turn.

603
00:44:03.783 --> 00:44:06.014
What is it exactly
that you do here?

604
00:44:06.049 --> 00:44:07.279
The witches. I mean.

605
00:44:07.314 --> 00:44:08.379
What's the witch thing about?

606
00:44:08.414 --> 00:44:10.249
-Okay.

607
00:44:10.284 --> 00:44:12.889
So. we don't have any powers in
any magical sense.

608
00:44:12.924 --> 00:44:14.858
it's true.

609
00:44:14.893 --> 00:44:17.157
But we do have a sisterhood.

610
00:44:17.192 --> 00:44:20.424
We have rituals.
We have rules.

611
00:44:20.459 --> 00:44:22.426
We support each other.

612
00:44:22.461 --> 00:44:26.166
One day when Emily's heading up
some major corporation or.

613
00:44:28.071 --> 00:44:29.367
-Alanda's running
for Parliament--

614
00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:35.945
-or Charlotte does.

615
00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:36.913
whatever Charlotte does.

616
00:44:42.085 --> 00:44:46.219
-.this bond we have
will be the support we need.

617
00:44:46.254 --> 00:44:49.354
-But there's only
a handful of you.

618
00:44:49.389 --> 00:44:50.960
-Of us.

619
00:44:50.995 --> 00:44:53.457
Amber. you are one of us.

620
00:44:53.492 --> 00:44:55.998
-And then.
there's the alumni.

621
00:44:56.033 --> 00:44:59.397
-Plus. how cool
are the dresses?

622
00:44:59.432 --> 00:45:01.300
-Amen to that.

623
00:45:01.335 --> 00:45:03.005
-Kirsten. you know
you're not in. right?

624
00:45:05.009 --> 00:45:06.976
-What about
peace through whatever

625
00:45:07.011 --> 00:45:09.374
and all that love
through sisterhood stuff?

626
00:45:09.409 --> 00:45:11.409
-Kirsten. I'm curious.

627
00:45:11.444 --> 00:45:13.312
How come you know so much
about witchcraft

628
00:45:13.347 --> 00:45:15.446
but you couldn't manage to learn
a simple four-liner?

629
00:45:18.517 --> 00:45:21.221

Sorry. It's just I've seen it
before. you know?

645
00:46:12.307 --> 00:46:13.372
-What do you mean?

646
00:46:13.407 --> 00:46:15.572
-I've seen it before.

647
00:46:15.607 --> 00:46:18.608
-Where?
-In one of my books.

648
00:46:18.643 --> 00:46:22.216
-You're mistaken.
It was my mother's.

649
00:46:22.251 --> 00:46:23.580
-I may be a bit dim
in Latin.

650
00:46:23.615 --> 00:46:25.615
but I know my witchcraft.

651
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:28.354
-Give it a rest. Kirs.

652
00:46:28.389 --> 00:46:30.895
-To the best
YWS initiation ever!

653
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.326
Hear. hear!

654
00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.901
-I need
some fresh air.

655
00:46:36.936 --> 00:46:37.869
-Yeah. me too.

656
00:46:50.344 --> 00:46:52.147
I can hardly see a thing.

657
00:46:52.182 --> 00:46:55.414
Yeah.
What's with this place?

658
00:46:55.449 --> 00:46:57.317
-Come on.

659
00:46:57.352 --> 00:46:58.417
I need to go to the car.

660
00:46:59.552 --> 00:47:01.123
I've got some cigs in there.

661
00:47:02.324 --> 00:47:06.095
They'll kill me. but hey.
I am what I am.

662
00:47:07.659 --> 00:47:10.297
Keep close.
We don't want to get lost.

663
00:47:10.332 --> 00:47:12.299
-Where did you park?
I can't see the car anywhere.

664
00:47:21.343 --> 00:47:22.540
-Got 'em.

665
00:47:23.609 --> 00:47:25.180
Amber?

666
00:47:26.249 --> 00:47:27.919
-What was that?

667
00:47:27.954 --> 00:47:29.613
-I didn't see anything.

668
00:47:29.648 --> 00:47:30.581
Are you okay?

669
00:47:32.387 --> 00:47:33.485
-We should
get back to the pub.

670
00:47:36.028 --> 00:47:38.259
Did you see something?

671
00:47:38.294 --> 00:47:39.656
-No.

672
00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:43.165
Yes. I don't know.

673
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.463
I don't want to stay out here.

674
00:48:04.518 --> 00:48:07.189
-They've forgotten
how to use a car.

675
00:48:07.224 --> 00:48:09.059
-I'll be downstairs
in the basement packing up.

676
00:48:09.094 --> 00:48:10.060
Do you need me for anything?

677
00:48:10.095 --> 00:48:11.061
Uh-uh. we're good.

678
00:48:28.707 --> 00:48:30.410
-I think
we're going the wrong way.

679
00:48:30.445 --> 00:48:31.983
Why?

680
00:48:32.018 --> 00:48:34.150
-Well. it didn't take us
this long to get to the car.

681
00:48:34.185 --> 00:48:36.119
So it shouldn't take us
this long to get back.

682
00:48:36.154 --> 00:48:37.615
-Ow!

683
00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:38.682
Is this a joke?

684
00:48:38.717 --> 00:48:41.091
I've just gone round
in a circle.

685
00:48:41.126 --> 00:48:42.389
-How did we get back here?

686
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:46.030
Did you hear that?

687
00:48:46.065 --> 00:48:46.998
-What?

688
00:48:50.135 --> 00:48:52.036
You really
don't hear anything?

689
00:48:52.071 --> 00:48:54.038
Hear what?

690
00:48:54.073 --> 00:48:55.138
Are you okay?

691
00:48:58.209 --> 00:48:59.373
It's all around us.

692
00:49:09.319 --> 00:49:11.022
-Hit the lights.

693
00:49:12.454 --> 00:49:14.190
-There! You see?

694
00:49:14.225 --> 00:49:15.191
-There's nothing there.

695
00:49:16.524 --> 00:49:18.128
-Do it again. I saw it.

696
00:49:19.659 --> 00:49:21.659
-All I see
is a blinding white light

697
00:49:21.694 --> 00:49:24.365
every time
that the car lights come on.

698
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.663
No. A silhouette.

699
00:49:25.698 --> 00:49:28.237
A man. I think.
He came by here earlier.

700
00:49:28.272 --> 00:49:31.207
And I can--I can hear him too.

701
00:49:31.242 --> 00:49:32.439
Hit the lights again.

702
00:49:32.474 --> 00:49:33.473
Charlotte.

703
00:49:36.709 --> 00:49:37.642
Charlotte?

704
00:49:40.185 --> 00:49:41.085
Charlotte?!

705
00:49:44.222 --> 00:49:45.254
Charlotte!

706
00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.360
Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte!

707
00:49:52.395 --> 00:49:53.559
Where are you?!

708
00:49:56.729 --> 00:49:59.334
Charlotte!

709
00:50:06.574 --> 00:50:07.639
-Amber?

710
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:17.748
Amber?

711
00:50:55.293 --> 00:50:56.193
-Oh!

712
00:50:59.726 --> 00:51:00.593
-Oh!

713
00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:09.206
Gray!

714
00:51:53.714 --> 00:51:56.187
-Charlotte!

715
00:52:01.887 --> 00:52:04.393
Something happened.

716
00:52:04.428 --> 00:52:05.625
Something happened to Charlotte.

717
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.561
Something--somebody took her.

718
00:52:07.596 --> 00:52:08.892
-What do you mean.
somebody took her?

719
00:52:08.927 --> 00:52:10.861
-I don't know.

720
00:52:10.896 --> 00:52:13.897
Something--it-it--
it grabbed her and she--she.

721
00:52:13.932 --> 00:52:15.866
-What? She what?

722
00:52:15.901 --> 00:52:18.209
-Something took her.

723
00:52:18.244 --> 00:52:19.540
-I'll go and get her.

724
00:52:19.575 --> 00:52:20.838
-No. no. you can't.
You can't go out there.

725
00:52:20.873 --> 00:52:21.773
You can't.
-You stay away from that door.

726
00:52:21.808 --> 00:52:23.610
We have to find her.

727
00:52:23.645 --> 00:52:24.544
-Because what if--

728
00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:25.843
-We're not leaving
our friend out there.

729
00:52:25.878 --> 00:52:26.778
Move out the way!

730
00:52:35.723 --> 00:52:37.393
Jesus. Amber!
Come and help!

731
00:52:41.828 --> 00:52:44.697
Charlotte!

732
00:52:55.842 --> 00:52:56.874
-Oh. crap.

733
00:52:56.909 --> 00:52:57.842
Charlotte!

734
00:52:59.384 --> 00:53:01.615
-Charlotte!

735
00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:03.551
-I'll get the lights
back on and come and help.

736
00:53:03.586 --> 00:53:04.849
Charlotte!

737
00:53:06.688 --> 00:53:07.687
-Charlotte!

738
00:53:09.526 --> 00:53:10.624
Charlotte?

739
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:13.330
Charlotte?

740
00:53:15.961 --> 00:53:17.532
Charlotte!

741
00:54:01.006 --> 00:54:02.346
-Oh. it's off.

742
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:06.383
What did Jess say?

743
00:54:09.784 --> 00:54:11.850
First. check that it is off.

744
00:54:15.691 --> 00:54:16.822
Right.

745
00:54:19.057 --> 00:54:21.827
Charlotte?

746
00:54:25.129 --> 00:54:26.403
Charlotte?

747
00:54:38.142 --> 00:54:39.449
Charlotte!

748
00:54:39.484 --> 00:54:40.384
-Charlotte?

749
00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.848
-We should have
stayed in the pub.

750
00:55:15.883 --> 00:55:18.752
-What is wrong with you?
Our friend is missing.

751
00:55:18.787 --> 00:55:20.655
-Quiet.

752
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:21.755
Where's Em?

753
00:55:23.055 --> 00:55:24.857
Em?

754
00:55:24.892 --> 00:55:25.825
Emily?!

755
00:55:28.599 --> 00:55:31.402
-Next. Check
there's enough fuel.

756
00:55:40.479 --> 00:55:41.478
Check.

757
00:55:45.176 --> 00:55:48.452
Charlotte? Is that you?

758
00:55:57.727 --> 00:56:00.090
And turn it to 220 volts.

759
00:56:24.622 --> 00:56:27.623
<i> Emily?</i>

760
00:56:27.658 --> 00:56:29.691
Emily?!

761
00:56:29.726 --> 00:56:31.759
-Charlotte!

762
00:56:31.794 --> 00:56:33.024
Emily?

763
00:56:40.033 --> 00:56:41.131
<i> I'm over here!</i>

764
00:56:41.166 --> 00:56:42.539
-Stay there!

765
00:56:42.574 --> 00:56:44.002
We have to stick together!

766
00:56:44.037 --> 00:56:45.234
<i> I can't see you!</i>

767
00:56:45.269 --> 00:56:46.642
-Follow my voice.

768
00:56:49.713 --> 00:56:51.009
-<i> Charlotte!</i>

769
00:56:52.518 --> 00:56:54.518
Jessica. where are you?

770
00:56:54.553 --> 00:56:55.882
<i> I'm here.</i>

771
00:57:02.957 --> 00:57:04.957
-Follow my voice!

772
00:57:04.992 --> 00:57:06.728
Can you see us now?

773
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.570
<i>Emily. where are you?</i>
<i>I can't see you!</i>

774
00:57:14.969 --> 00:57:16.001
<i> Em?</i>

775
00:57:25.683 --> 00:57:26.814
-What was that?

776
00:57:31.018 --> 00:57:32.083
Emily?!

777
00:57:37.222 --> 00:57:39.629
-Emily. Emily.

778
00:57:41.864 --> 00:57:42.764
Flora. she's--

779
00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:45.965
Get her up! Get her up!

780
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.033
Help me. Kirsten!
All of you. help!

781
00:57:48.068 --> 00:57:50.002
Is she dead?

782
00:57:50.037 --> 00:57:51.267
Of course she's dead.

783
00:58:13.698 --> 00:58:14.928
-Get the lights!
-They're not coming on.

784
00:58:19.836 --> 00:58:21.704
-What the fuck is going on?

785
00:58:21.739 --> 00:58:23.904
-Flora's face.
Hanging like that.

786
00:58:26.304 --> 00:58:28.678
Don't you remember?
Dr. Cooper?

787
00:58:28.713 --> 00:58:31.010
We saw it in class.
And it's here too.

788
00:58:35.379 --> 00:58:36.719
-Here.

789
00:58:41.627 --> 00:58:42.989
This is a witch hunt.

790
00:58:47.028 --> 00:58:49.864
-Now is not the time
for games. Kirsten.

791
00:58:49.899 --> 00:58:52.933
We are not witches!

792
00:58:52.968 --> 00:58:55.100
And Charlotte's still out there!

793
00:59:03.275 --> 00:59:05.308
-What?

794
00:59:05.343 --> 00:59:07.651
It's you.

795
00:59:07.686 --> 00:59:09.213
-What do you mean.
it's me?

796
00:59:09.248 --> 00:59:11.721
You think I did that to Flora?
That?

797
00:59:11.756 --> 00:59:13.151
Are you fucking kidding me?

798
00:59:13.186 --> 00:59:15.252
-I don't know what I mean.
I don't know. but I feel it!

799
00:59:15.287 --> 00:59:17.089
This has something
to do with you!

800
00:59:18.664 --> 00:59:20.631
You're weird.
There's something about you.

801
00:59:20.666 --> 00:59:22.325
Something really wrong.

802
00:59:24.934 --> 00:59:26.802
-Where's Kate?

803
00:59:26.837 --> 00:59:28.265
-She--she was
in the basement

804
00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.838
when we left her
to find Charlotte.

805
00:59:29.873 --> 00:59:30.971
-She went out
to turn on the genny.

806
00:59:31.006 --> 00:59:32.775
-Oh my God.
Somebody call the police!

807
00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:34.007
There is
no signal here!

808
00:59:37.078 --> 00:59:38.110
Kate?

809
00:59:38.145 --> 00:59:39.782
Hey. let me in!

810
00:59:39.817 --> 00:59:40.783
-It's Kate!

811
00:59:40.818 --> 00:59:42.312
Kate! Kate!

812
00:59:42.347 --> 00:59:44.347
-Why would Kate be outside
if the lights are still off?

813
00:59:44.382 --> 00:59:45.348
It might not be her.

814
00:59:45.383 --> 00:59:46.349
-Of course it's her.

815
00:59:46.384 --> 00:59:47.691
-Let her in. Amber.

816
00:59:47.726 --> 00:59:48.890
-Maybe the genny
is out of fuel?

817
00:59:51.092 --> 00:59:51.958
-Let her in!

818
00:59:51.993 --> 00:59:52.959
Give me the key
and I will let her in.

819
00:59:52.994 --> 00:59:55.699
-There is a killer
out there somewhere. Jess!

820
00:59:55.734 --> 00:59:58.031
-Amber. let me in.

821
00:59:58.066 --> 00:59:59.395
-Open the door!
Let her in!

822
00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:00.363
Kate!

823
01:00:02.235 --> 01:00:03.905
-We need to make sure
it's really her.

824
01:00:22.024 --> 01:00:23.089
Let me in. Amber.

825
01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.409
Matthias Alistair.

826
01:00:48.512 --> 01:00:49.852
Please. let me in.

827
01:01:23.217 --> 01:01:24.381
Heather Gray.

828
01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:28.957
Amber Gray. It's me.

829
01:01:28.992 --> 01:01:30.728
-You must be
Heather Gray's descendant.

830
01:01:42.467 --> 01:01:43.873
-I want to go home.

831
01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:45.039
If that's not Kate.
then who is it?

832
01:01:45.074 --> 01:01:45.940
I want to go home now!

833
01:01:45.975 --> 01:01:48.108
-It's not Kate.
Em. she probably left.

834
01:01:48.143 --> 01:01:49.175
She didn't see us
when we went to the woods

835
01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:50.009
and she must have left.

836
01:01:50.044 --> 01:01:50.843
-Okay. come on.
Let's go home now.

837
01:01:50.879 --> 01:01:51.911
-No. we need to
stay here together

838
01:01:51.946 --> 01:01:53.179
until the police come.
We need to find Charlotte.

839
01:01:54.281 --> 01:01:55.313
-We need to leave.

840
01:01:55.348 --> 01:01:56.886
-What about Kate?

841
01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:59.856
-Listen to me.
We have to leave right now.

842
01:01:59.891 --> 01:02:01.418
-Kate's not here.
Maybe she did leave.

843
01:02:01.453 --> 01:02:02.826
-Amber's right.

844
01:02:02.861 --> 01:02:04.388
We need to go.

845
01:02:04.423 --> 01:02:07.831
We go to town. and we get help
to find Kate and Charlotte.

846
01:02:07.866 --> 01:02:08.964
-Charlotte's car?

847
01:02:08.999 --> 01:02:10.328
-Where's the keys?

848
01:02:10.363 --> 01:02:11.835
-They fell.
-I'll get them.

849
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:15.234
-I'll come with you.
-No. You stay here.

850
01:02:15.269 --> 01:02:16.466
If anything goes wrong.

851
01:02:16.501 --> 01:02:18.204
you can magic us out of here.
-I'll go!

852
01:02:18.239 --> 01:02:19.502
-Is there another way
out of here?

853
01:02:19.537 --> 01:02:20.976
-There's the old
barrel hatch in the basement.

854
01:02:25.246 --> 01:02:27.851
-All right. Get back.

855
01:02:27.886 --> 01:02:28.984
Catch me if I fall. yeah?

856
01:02:29.019 --> 01:02:30.117
-Yeah.

857
01:02:42.461 --> 01:02:43.867
Oh.

858
01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:15.459
Yeah.

859
01:03:15.494 --> 01:03:16.867
Wait for me.
I'll find them.

860
01:03:26.241 --> 01:03:27.339
I know
they're here somewhere.

861
01:03:48.934 --> 01:03:50.395
I've got them! Come on!

862
01:04:02.508 --> 01:04:05.113
Go. go. go. go. go!

863
01:04:05.148 --> 01:04:06.246
Put the key.

864
01:05:39.539 --> 01:05:41.440
Oh. my God.

865
01:05:41.475 --> 01:05:44.278
Oh my God. Charlotte.

866
01:05:44.313 --> 01:05:46.115
My god. did I kill her?

867
01:05:47.448 --> 01:05:49.415
Jesus. who killed her?
Who put her there like that?

868
01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:53.155
I mean. who did that to her?

869
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:55.289
Oh my God. Emily.

870
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:59.161
-It wasn't you.

871
01:05:59.196 --> 01:06:02.230
We didn't see Charlotte.
None of us.

872
01:06:02.265 --> 01:06:04.430
We couldn't help Emily.

873
01:06:04.465 --> 01:06:06.069
It was an accident.

874
01:06:06.104 --> 01:06:08.104
It was nobody's fault with Em.

875
01:06:10.735 --> 01:06:13.208
-This was your fault.

876
01:06:13.243 --> 01:06:14.770
Your fault.

877
01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:17.443
Kirsten's right.
You are a witch.

878
01:06:17.478 --> 01:06:18.774
You conjured this thing up

879
01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:20.479
and you better fucking
get rid of it!

880
01:06:20.514 --> 01:06:22.085
-Leave her alone.

881
01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.152
-You shut up!

882
01:06:23.187 --> 01:06:25.319
-What're you gonna do? Hmm?

883
01:06:25.354 --> 01:06:27.222
Fix it. witch.

884
01:06:29.391 --> 01:06:30.324
-I can't.

885
01:06:31.723 --> 01:06:32.689
I don't know how.

886
01:06:34.231 --> 01:06:37.133
-You must know.
What happened in the basement.

887
01:06:37.168 --> 01:06:38.431
-What happened in the basement?

888
01:06:38.466 --> 01:06:41.500
-And at the initiation.
You know it's Matthias.

889
01:06:41.535 --> 01:06:43.172
-Who the fuck
is Matthias?

890
01:06:43.207 --> 01:06:44.536
-What happened
in the basement?

891
01:06:44.571 --> 01:06:46.307
-Please. Amber.

892
01:06:46.342 --> 01:06:47.572
We need you now.

893
01:06:47.607 --> 01:06:49.838
-Who is Matthias?

894
01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:51.642
The witch hunter.

895
01:06:51.677 --> 01:06:55.481
He swore to kill any descendant
of Heather Gray.

896
01:06:55.516 --> 01:06:56.812
He's hunting Amber.

897
01:06:58.453 --> 01:06:59.683
He vowed that he would not stop

898
01:06:59.718 --> 01:07:01.421
until he killed
the last witch in England.

899
01:07:03.788 --> 01:07:05.227
-It was a bedtime story.

900
01:07:07.429 --> 01:07:09.660
My mother would tell me over
and over again. the same one.

901
01:07:11.268 --> 01:07:13.235
About a bad man
that would become a demon

902
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:15.237
and I'd fight him.

903
01:07:15.272 --> 01:07:16.766
I just thought
it was a fairy tale.

904
01:07:18.176 --> 01:07:19.769
a really dark fairy tale.

905
01:07:21.674 --> 01:07:23.806
-That makes you
the last Gray witch.

906
01:07:23.841 --> 01:07:25.346
-You should have told us.

907
01:07:25.381 --> 01:07:27.150
You should never have joined us.

908
01:07:28.417 --> 01:07:30.153
-I didn't know.

909
01:07:30.188 --> 01:07:33.255
And I didn't want to join your
stupid coven anyway. remember?

910
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:35.818
I don't want to!
I did it for Kirsten.

911
01:07:35.853 --> 01:07:38.128
Well. it's too late
for that now!

912
01:07:38.163 --> 01:07:40.229
You just--you just need to
get us out of here.

913
01:07:40.264 --> 01:07:41.593
You conjured him up.

914
01:07:41.628 --> 01:07:44.464
There must be a way to return
him to. where--wherever.

915
01:07:44.499 --> 01:07:47.401
-Well. find it. Fast.

916
01:07:47.436 --> 01:07:50.503
I'm not going to die. not here.
not like. not like the others.

917
01:07:50.538 --> 01:07:52.703
-Shut up. I need to think.

918
01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:56.641
-We need to
get the lights on.

919
01:07:56.676 --> 01:07:58.610
I'm not having her do
any spells in the dark.

920
01:07:58.645 --> 01:08:00.480
And we need to be able
to see him.

921
01:08:00.515 --> 01:08:02.878
He is using the dark
to hide from us.

922
01:08:02.913 --> 01:08:04.154
I want to see what's happening.

923
01:08:06.191 --> 01:08:07.751
You're right. Amber.

924
01:08:07.786 --> 01:08:10.160
You don't need anybody.

925
01:08:10.195 --> 01:08:11.689
You don't need friends.

926
01:08:11.724 --> 01:08:13.592
You can't keep them.

927
01:08:13.627 --> 01:08:15.363
You just get them killed!

928
01:08:16.795 --> 01:08:18.201
-I'll turn the genny on.

929
01:08:18.236 --> 01:08:19.697
I'll go.

930
01:08:19.732 --> 01:08:21.468
I'm stronger and faster.

931
01:08:24.341 --> 01:08:26.737
It could have got us when we
were running back from the car.

932
01:08:26.772 --> 01:08:28.475
But it didn't.

933
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:31.313
That must mean something. right?

934
01:08:31.348 --> 01:08:32.215
Maybe it's had enough?

935
01:08:35.286 --> 01:08:36.252
This will have to do.

936
01:08:37.585 --> 01:08:39.882
I want you to watch
from the window.

937
01:08:39.917 --> 01:08:41.455
Hey. Amber.

938
01:08:41.490 --> 01:08:43.490
If you see anything coming
for me. you better scream.

939
01:08:45.494 --> 01:08:46.394
-Come back.

940
01:11:40.801 --> 01:11:43.769
Come. On.

941
01:11:43.804 --> 01:11:45.540
You bitch!

942
01:12:02.889 --> 01:12:04.460
-Yes.

943
01:12:04.495 --> 01:12:05.659
-Turn the lights off.
I can't see.

944
01:12:14.032 --> 01:12:15.438
-Something's wrong.

945
01:12:15.473 --> 01:12:16.703
Kirsten?

946
01:12:16.738 --> 01:12:18.441
Kirsten?
Kirsten. something's wrong.

947
01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:22.709
-Open it.

948
01:12:22.744 --> 01:12:24.513
Alanda!

949
01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:25.943
Alanda! Jess. come and help!

950
01:12:25.978 --> 01:12:27.846
Alanda!

951
01:12:28.882 --> 01:12:30.178
Alanda!

952
01:12:30.213 --> 01:12:31.146
Alanda!

953
01:12:55.106 --> 01:12:56.512
We should pray.

954
01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:04.454
-The cellar doors
are unlocked.

955
01:13:28.645 --> 01:13:29.710
-Jess.

956
01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:32.449
Jessica.

957
01:13:34.145 --> 01:13:35.881
Hey.

958
01:13:35.916 --> 01:13:36.948
Hey. look at me.

959
01:13:40.558 --> 01:13:42.888
-He killed Alanda.

960
01:13:42.923 --> 01:13:44.857
We're going to die.

961
01:13:44.892 --> 01:13:49.059
-No. No. We can't.

962
01:13:49.094 --> 01:13:51.061
Don't you see?

963
01:13:51.096 --> 01:13:52.469
It's the power of three.

964
01:13:54.935 --> 01:13:56.902
Good things come in threes.
It's a magic number.

965
01:13:56.937 --> 01:13:59.267
It's powerful.

966
01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:02.237
The witches in<i> Macbeth</i> .
the Holy Trinity.

967
01:14:02.272 --> 01:14:03.546
Nothing can beat three.

968
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:06.483
Tell her. Amber.

969
01:14:09.851 --> 01:14:13.886
-Kirsten's right. Three.

970
01:14:13.921 --> 01:14:15.789
We have to survive
if there are three of us.

971
01:14:15.824 --> 01:14:17.692
Everybody knows that.

972
01:14:17.727 --> 01:14:19.188
-You really are a witch?

973
01:14:21.258 --> 01:14:22.895
-I am.

974
01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:25.161
-Then you can
get us out of here?

975
01:14:25.196 --> 01:14:27.229
She can.

976
01:14:27.264 --> 01:14:28.934
Because we're friends.

977
01:14:28.969 --> 01:14:30.507
We're gonna get
through this. okay?

978
01:14:32.742 --> 01:14:33.708
-Okay.

979
01:14:36.647 --> 01:14:39.549
-So what do we do?

980
01:14:39.584 --> 01:14:41.078
-We need to help Amber
figure out

981
01:14:41.113 --> 01:14:43.553
just what power she has
and how to kill this thing.

982
01:14:43.588 --> 01:14:45.687
I'm not going out there again.

983
01:14:45.722 --> 01:14:48.283
-Nobody's going outside.
One thing is clear.

984
01:14:48.318 --> 01:14:50.021
If he's not invited.
he can't come in.

985
01:14:50.056 --> 01:14:52.254
We're safe if we stay inside.

986
01:14:52.289 --> 01:14:53.222
-I have to go out there.
I have to fight him.

987
01:14:53.257 --> 01:14:54.927
-No. No.

988
01:14:54.962 --> 01:14:56.896
He's too strong out there.
That fog. the dark.

989
01:14:56.931 --> 01:14:57.864
-I'll bring him to us.

990
01:14:57.899 --> 01:14:59.668
-No. no.

991
01:14:59.703 --> 01:15:01.736
-It's okay.

992
01:15:01.771 --> 01:15:03.870
It's okay. Jess.

993
01:15:03.905 --> 01:15:05.773
I can do this.

994
01:15:05.808 --> 01:15:06.873
I can.

995
01:15:08.272 --> 01:15:09.876
But I'll need your help.
both of you.

996
01:15:11.616 --> 01:15:12.747
We need to lay a trap.

997
01:15:53.152 --> 01:15:54.382
-Ready?

998
01:15:54.417 --> 01:15:56.659
-Ready.

999
01:15:56.694 --> 01:15:57.924
-Ready.

1000
01:16:53.146 --> 01:16:54.211
-Why doesn't he come?

1001
01:17:00.384 --> 01:17:01.483
-We need bait.

1002
01:17:01.519 --> 01:17:03.693
One of us needs to be alone
in here to lure him in.

1003
01:17:03.728 --> 01:17:05.222
-No. He'll come.

1004
01:17:05.257 --> 01:17:06.696
Think about it.
all the others were on their own

1005
01:17:06.731 --> 01:17:07.697
when he came.

1006
01:17:07.732 --> 01:17:08.731
-Too risky!

1007
01:17:08.766 --> 01:17:10.997
-I can do it.

1008
01:17:11.032 --> 01:17:12.460
-No. we stick together.

1009
01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:14.968
-We are not getting
out of here until you kill him.

1010
01:17:15.003 --> 01:17:16.871
That means that
we need to lure him in.

1011
01:17:16.906 --> 01:17:18.070
-It's me he wants.

1012
01:17:18.105 --> 01:17:19.269
-We need to
break the circle.

1013
01:17:19.304 --> 01:17:20.941
The circle's keeping him away.

1014
01:17:32.218 --> 01:17:33.987
-It's okay. Jess.

1015
01:17:34.022 --> 01:17:35.153
It's okay.

1016
01:17:36.288 --> 01:17:37.694
It's okay.

1017
01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:44.030
Stay behind me.
Stay close.

1018
01:17:59.982 --> 01:18:01.982
-The earth listens to me.

1019
01:18:02.017 --> 01:18:04.347
The earth quakes at my word.

1020
01:18:04.382 --> 01:18:06.118
The mighty Goddess
is within me

1021
01:18:06.153 --> 01:18:08.219
and I compel evil
this night and forever

1022
01:18:08.254 --> 01:18:11.156
to show your face
so that you may be shamed.

1023
01:18:11.191 --> 01:18:13.356
The Goddess has spoken.

1024
01:18:20.365 --> 01:18:21.496
What are you doing?

1025
01:18:21.531 --> 01:18:23.938
-I'm calling him up.

1026
01:18:23.973 --> 01:18:26.006
The earth listens to me.

1027
01:18:26.041 --> 01:18:28.074
The earth quakes at my word.

1028
01:18:28.109 --> 01:18:29.977
The mighty Goddess
is within me

1029
01:18:30.012 --> 01:18:32.342
and I compel evil
this night and forever

1030
01:18:32.377 --> 01:18:35.444
to show your face
so that you may be shamed.

1031
01:18:35.479 --> 01:18:37.985
The Goddess has spoken!

1032
01:19:22.328 --> 01:19:23.800
Gray.

1033
01:19:29.104 --> 01:19:30.367
Gray.

1034
01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:45.888
You know why I'm here.

1035
01:19:51.456 --> 01:19:52.356
You must die.

1036
01:19:53.557 --> 01:19:55.865
-Amber. get back.

1037
01:19:58.463 --> 01:19:59.869
I made a vow.

1038
01:20:01.939 --> 01:20:03.136
There will be no escape.

1039
01:20:06.339 --> 01:20:07.470
You will die.

1040
01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:25.059
-Here you are. Gray.

1041
01:20:25.094 --> 01:20:26.093
Alone.

1042
01:20:29.494 --> 01:20:30.900
-I've waited for you.

1043
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:34.035
Hell is waiting for you.

1044
01:20:36.699 --> 01:20:40.470
I can see into
your black soul.

1045
01:20:57.027 --> 01:20:59.621
You have power.

1046
01:20:59.656 --> 01:21:00.930
Show it now.

1047
01:21:05.563 --> 01:21:07.002
-You killed Heather Gray.

1048
01:21:07.037 --> 01:21:08.333
-And many like her.

1049
01:21:34.262 --> 01:21:36.559

<i>The Goddess will keep you safe.</i>

1050
01:21:36.594 --> 01:21:39.265
<i>The Goddess will keep you safe.</i>

1051
01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:42.466
<i>Please. Amber.</i>
<i>we need you now.</i>

1052
01:21:42.501 --> 01:21:44.468
<i>The Goddess will keep you safe.</i>

1053
01:21:58.451 --> 01:22:00.957
-You want to resist me.

1054
01:22:03.588 --> 01:22:06.028
You will fail.

1055
01:22:06.063 --> 01:22:09.229
-Let us go and I will
release you from the curse.

1056
01:22:09.264 --> 01:22:11.693
It's not for you
to release me.

1057
01:22:11.728 --> 01:22:14.168
When my work is done.

1058
01:22:14.203 --> 01:22:16.434
when this land is rid
of witches.

1059
01:22:16.469 --> 01:22:18.667
then I will be free.

1060
01:22:18.702 --> 01:22:20.669
I just want to confirm

1061
01:22:20.704 --> 01:22:24.739
that England will not
be sullied by your kind.

1062
01:22:26.116 --> 01:22:27.247
-You have failed.

1063
01:22:28.646 --> 01:22:33.715
I exist because you have failed.

1064
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:36.751
You have slept for 500 years.

1065
01:22:36.786 --> 01:22:40.062
and in that time.
I have grown stronger.

1066
01:22:40.097 --> 01:22:42.196
I am powerful because of you.

1067
01:22:43.331 --> 01:22:46.200
I am the mighty Goddess.

1068
01:22:46.235 --> 01:22:49.368
My power knows no bounds.

1069
01:22:49.403 --> 01:22:51.568
Let evil know
that it is Amber Gray

1070
01:22:51.603 --> 01:22:54.472
who has destroyed
Matthias Alistair.

1071
01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.609
By the mighty Goddess.

1072
01:22:59.644 --> 01:23:01.545
-we drive you from here.

1073
01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:06.286
Unclean spirit. satanic power.
infernal invader.

1074
01:23:06.321 --> 01:23:08.618
in the name of all those
that you have killed.

1075
01:23:08.653 --> 01:23:10.455
we release you from Purgatory

1076
01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:12.490
and send your soul to Hell.
