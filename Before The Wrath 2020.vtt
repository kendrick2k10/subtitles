00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.965
As Galileans. we witnessed
his first miracle.

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.624
He warned us that a time of
great deception would come.

6
00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:31.025
But we must hold on
to our faith that one

7
00:00:31.025 --> 00:00:37.899
day He would return to save
us from the end of the world.

8
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.760
Most people don't believe
that Jesus is coming back.

9
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.420
What if there was evidence that
proves that this is all real?

10
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.520
Because there were
so many people

11
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.440
bringing up little bits
and pieces of this.

12
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.990
I'm thinking there's got
to be a pattern here.

13
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.470
The Bible talks about
it as being a mystery.

14
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.360
but why does the
rapture have to happen?

15
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.040
What's the point to it all?

16
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.440
A Galilean would have
understood that perfectly.

17
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.330
They are the key to everything.

18
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.320
I'm just so stunned.

19
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.270
I never thought I would
see this in my lifetime.

20
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.520
This is the most profound
discovery in human history.

21
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.630
From his promise made through
wine at the Last Supper to why

22
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.010
the world cannot know
the day of his return.

23
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.510
we were chosen to preserve the
truth until the end of days.

24
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.000
So even if we are not
spared from death.

25
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.910
others can unveil what
we knew and believe.

26
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.717
This discovery proves
that He is coming back.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

28
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.330
We are not destined to
live in this world forever.

29
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.920
for out of the
earth we were taken.

30
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.740
as we are nothing
more than dust.

31
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.395
and to dust we shall return.

32
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:17.850
Though the body must perish.
the spirit lives forever.

33
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.660
so I urge you to seek the
things that are eternal

34
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.080
rather than that which
will decay into nothing.

35
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.850
As I write to you. the foretold
coming of the messiah. our Lord

36
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.840
Jesus Christ. is
now fulfilled. as we

37
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.510
await his prophesied
return at the end of days.

38
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.830
Though He first came
to save the world.

39
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.460
He will return to judge it.

tribulation approaches such as

42
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.350
has not been seen since
the beginning of the world

43
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.080
nor shall there ever be again.

44
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.830
But our Lord will return to
retrieve those that follow Him

45
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.540
from the wrath
that will be poured

46
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.500
out upon all who are living
on the face of the Earth.

47
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.180
A time of worldwide
wars. famines.

48
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.580

and sickness that will

49
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.575
bring an abundance of death.

50
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.040
The oceans will rage
and the land will burn.

51
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.762
as the moon becomes as blood
and the sun black as sackcloth.

52
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.690
But I warn you. before
that terrible day there

53
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.450
will be a great falling
away from the faith.

54
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.860
And when the hour of judgment
comes upon this fallen world.

55

of signs for his return

throughout the scriptures.

will be unveiled

that will witness

63
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:22.250

when the savior returns.

It's been 2.000 years since the
final prophecies were recorded.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.100
and today the foundation for
the convergence of nearly

68

biblical prophecies

70
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.430
has never been more prominent.

71
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.730
As a result. a recent rise in
debates regarding the signs

72
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.550
of the times has led to
growing division regarding

73
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.090
when the messiah will return.

74
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.520
After all. if the
events prophesied

75
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.510
within the ancient records
are indeed to come to pass.

76
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.670
then knowing the timing
of the Lord's return

77
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.610
would be of great importance.

of the rapture--

84
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.460
and particularly in
the last 10 years.

85
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.410

of saying. my. how

said of the early church--

And recent findings
from organizations.

91
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.600
such as LifeWay Research.
confirm that the infighting

92
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.790
among Christians is deepening.

93
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.250
In one of our surveys.
we ask when they thought

94
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.700
the rapture would occur.

95
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.540
The largest group. 36%.
believe that the rapture

96
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.027
will occur pre-tribulation.

97
00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:16.260
But if that's the
largest group. that

98
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.930
means there's not a
majority believing any one

99
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.960
thing about the rapture.

100
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.540
In addition to the 36% that
believe the rapture will occur

101
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.590
before the tribulation period
begins. 4% of Christians

102
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.640
believe it will
happen in the middle.

103
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.320
18% believe the rapture
will happen at the end.

104
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.559
An additional 13%
consist of other timing

105
00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.710
variations and theories.

106
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.560
4% just aren't sure
about any of it.

107
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.810
And surprisingly. the remaining
25%. a growing statistic.

108
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.470
no longer believe in a
literal rapture at all.

109
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.470
But why is this happening?

110
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.680
People have access to a
lot of information right

111
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.710
at their fingertips. so
they want to go and develop

112
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:06.640
their ideas on their own.

113
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.860
They want to put
together this cornucopia

114
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.040
of eschatological
beliefs without any kind

115
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.320
of hermeneutical framework.

116
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.630
But it really may not match
up with any views out there.

117
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.090
So while the debate
rages on regarding

118
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.830
the signs of the times--

119
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.350
Some Christians believe
this is the final sign

120
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.320
for Christ's return. as Russia
occupies war-torn Syria.

they send troops to the border.

which makes up

123
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.910
most of the global
population. couldn't

124
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.460
care less about the
return of Jesus.

125
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.550
scoffing at what is perceived
as nothing more than

126
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.095
unfounded biblical nonsense.

127
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.200
It's helping to
drive people away.

128
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.080
First it's going to drive
them away from the topic we're

129
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.320
talking about. but ultimately
it will drive people

130
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.750
away from the church.
from Christianity.

131
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.210
from pursuing the faith.

132
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.280
That's how serious this is.

133
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.620
Yeah. I'm sure that
somebody that has not bought

134
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.980
into the teachings
of Jesus Christ

135
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.040
scratch their head a little bit
if something this important.

136
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.070
about Jesus returning--

137
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.990
Christians can't even explain
how that's going to happen.

138
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.370
After all. if the validity
of biblical prophecy

139
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.250
can be confirmed by
historical discoveries.

140
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.830
then why can't most Christians
get on the same page

141
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.170
when it comes to the
return of their messiah?

142
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.715
Maybe this is because we're
asking the wrong question.

143
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.350
There is so much
infighting about when

144
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:57.270
Jesus is coming back. nobody
stopped and asked why.

145
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.830
But the fact is. the timing
is not nearly as important

146
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.110
as the why of his return.

147
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.920
People forget to even ask.
why is Jesus coming back?

148
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.270
Why is all this going to happen?

149
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.800
Why must there be
an end of the world?

150
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.050
And I think we're focusing
on the wrong thing.

151
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.040
The issue is why does the
rapture have to happen.

152
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.650
What's the point to it all?

153
00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.470
So what is the point?

154
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.530
Are the events of the end
times simply a sequence

155
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.670
of ancient superstitions. or
did those that were with Christ

156
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.880
understand something
much greater that was

157
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.740
buried by the sands of time?

158
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.680
Before our story can begin.
we need to first understand

159
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.260
that Jesus wasn't simply a Jew.

160
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.560
More specifically.
he was a Galilean.

161
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.470
Not only that. but
Jesus's disciples

162
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.970
were all Galileans as well.

163
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.200
They were not only Galileans.
they were Galileans from just

164
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.640
about every walk of life.

165
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.500
You've got a guy
who's a fisherman.

166
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.570
You've got a guy
who's a tax collector.

167
00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.180
And yet Jesus assembled
these Galileans together.

168
00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.600
And I think there's a great
reason why the Galileans being

169
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.200
present. his disciples.
future apostles.

170
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.130
would be spoken to by Christ
in the Galilean vernacular.

171
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.340
You see. even though the regions
throughout ancient Israel

172
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.210
share the same culture. the
Galileans developed customs

173
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.210
that were unique only to them.

174
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.010
Why is this important?

175
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.670
Because Jesus used
people's cultures

176
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:39.080
to more deeply communicate
the spiritual nature of God.

177
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.580
He used words and symbols
and analogies and parables

178
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.350
for them to understand.

179
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.300
You see it on the
Sermon on the Mount--

180
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:51.530
speaking to them in ways
that they can understand.

181
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.050
Speaking to them about
being fishers of men.

182
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.320
you know. for example.

183
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.710
Why would you use that
analogy unless you

184
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.840
knew that these are fishermen?

185
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.670
Everything He said was
based on life that he lived.

186
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.340
culture that he belonged to.

187
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.940
I think it's hard for us
to understand in our day

188
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.280
what it was like for
them in their day.

189
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.590
When Jesus spoke. it was from
the heart to their heart.

190
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:22.040
There was a profound
connection made.

191
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.970
The first century believers
had such a clear understanding

192
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.740
of what Jesus was saying.

193
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.090
He gave them clear revelation.

194
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.540
So it's no wonder that
one day his disciples

195
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.940
came to Him to ask
about the fulfillment

196
00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.250
of God's plan for the future.

197
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.905
And Jesus answered them
in shocking detail.

198
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.900
And He uses illustrations that
they can understand that tells

199
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.320
them the world is going
to come to an end someday.

200
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.070
and here's how it's
going to happen.

201
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.520
So to fully understand the
depths of what Jesus could have

202
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.730
revealed to the Galileans
regarding how and why He would

203
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:07.080
return in the last days. we must
understand the unique culture

204
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.060
to whom He was speaking.

205
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.900
We need to see the Messiah
through their eyes.

206
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.200
This sparked an ambitious
research project.

207
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.150
and fragments of
new insight began

208
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.610
to expose the forgotten ways
of the ancient Galileans.

209
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.360
You know that 2/3 of the gospel
took place in a little strip

210
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.920
of land by the Sea of Galilee?

211
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.770
2/3 of the gospel.

212
00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.210
It actually makes no sense.
if you really think about it.

213
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.420
Most of the Jews didn't
live there. but yet 2/3

214
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.200
of the gospel took
place right there.

215
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.770
So you cannot ignore the culture
and the people. the life.

216
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.450
and the habits of those days.

217
00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.600
And that's why the Galileans
are playing such a big part.

218
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.250
There are a lot of
other people who have

219
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.110
a lot of pieces to the puzzle.

220
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.660
And a lot of other people are
working on the same projects.

221
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.420
It's an enormous research
project to make sure that you

222
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.510
find it and get it right.

223
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.610
Because there were
so many people

224
00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.500
bringing up little bits
and pieces of this.

225
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.360
I'm thinking there's got
to be a pattern here.

226
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.410
And there was-- pieces to a
puzzle that formed a prophetic

227
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.420
timeline woven
throughout the ancient

228
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.610
scriptures that
directly references

229
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.950
an ancient Galilean ceremony--

230
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.500
a ceremony that was passed
down through generations

231
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.860
to foretell how and
why Christ will return

232
00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.210
in the last days of the world.

233
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.070
And of all the
ancient ceremonies.

234
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.740
this secret could
have been hiding.

235
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.550
It was discovered within
a one-of-a-kind wedding--

236
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:52.240
a wedding that contains a series
of customs that would unfold

237
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.200
over an entire year. revealing
a chronological sequence

238
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.560
of events that perfectly aligns
with the recorded biblical

239
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.830
prophecies leading to the
second coming of Christ.

240
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.820
It's a wedding.

241
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.310
It is a Galilean-style wedding.

242
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.720
There's no doubt about it.

243
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.820
Why use a Galilean wedding?

244
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.180
Because all of his
disciples were Galileans.

245
00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.740
When Jesus taught his disciples.
He used an object to start

246
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.420
with that they already knew.

247
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.690
Then He would say. the kingdom
of heaven is like that.

248
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.400
In the case of the
Galilean wedding.

249
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.720
He would say to the guys.
you know what our weddings

250
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.520
are like. don't you?

251
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.620
We do them all the time.

252
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.810
The end of the world is
going to be like that.

253
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.530
The parallels to the
rapture are incredible.

254
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.690
and it is so brilliant.

255
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.088
It's so brilliant.

256
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.540
So what exactly about
their ancient wedding

257
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.310
changes everything
that we thought we

258
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.240
knew about the second coming?

259
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.000
To truly understand the
depth of what we're only

260
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.340
now rediscovering. we must
journey back to ancient Galilee

261
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.349
during the time of
Christ to follow

262
00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.079
the very sequence of
events that was hidden

263
00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.780
within their prophetic wedding.

264
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:14.450
This is where the story begins.

265
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.060
These are the Galileans.
and this is what they knew.

266
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.452
[AMBIENT MUSIC]

267
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.290
Welcome to the town of Cana.

268
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.680
Israel is now under
Roman control.

269
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.990
ruled by Tiberius Caesar.

270
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.030
And under his cruel
authority. life

271
00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.080
is harsh for many of the Jews.

272
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.390
But on this day. there's
hope for the future.

273
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.040
a promise for a new beginning--

274
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.610
because on this day. the
betrothal between a young groom

275
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.560
and his bride is taking place.

276
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.660
I don't think it's possible
to overstate how important

277
00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.680
a wedding is in the Middle
Eastern culture today.

278
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.190
as it was in that day.
the first century.

279
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.090
A wedding was the most
important event that would take

280
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.320
place in any town for anyone.

281
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.220
In fact. as word spread
throughout the streets

282
00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.940
that a betrothal was taking
place. everyone who was able

283
00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.220
would rush to the main
gate to witness it.

284
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.490
Everything took
place at the gate.

285
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.070
And this was really. really
important. because this

286
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.600
is where you found the elders.

287
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.510
The elders ratified
legal agreements.

288
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.080
And if you held the
ceremonies near the gate.

289
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.090
you would have
layers of people that

290
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.850
would gather around who
are maybe not family

291
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.670
members. maybe not friends.

292
00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.170
So you see. having wedding
guests the way we have them

293
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.270
today wasn't important to them.

294
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.760
They wanted witnesses.
because you can't

295
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.850
make a covenant without
having witnesses

296
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.170
to ratify the covenant.

297
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.020
There is a written
proposal that is presented.

298
00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.960
It is a written
covenant of marriage

299
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.310
that the bride accepts.

300
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.900
They would be asked. do
you agree on these terms?

301
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.140
They would say. "We
do." which means

302
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.520
that they can't go back on it.

303
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.860
They can't say. "I didn't
know that was in there."

304
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.110
or "those terms were
disagreeable to me."

305
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.610
After the agreement outlining
the union between the two

306
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.550
families was
publicly read. gifts

307
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.740
were then exchanged.
with the most

308
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.050
extravagant going to the bride.

309
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.010
In fact. contrary to
popular belief. a dowry.

310
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.280
or the price that was paid to
the bride's father in Galilee.

311
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.620
was not a purchase of
the bride as property

312
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.740
as it was with surrounding
cultures in the Middle East.

313
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.840
but rather an
insurance policy that

314
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.970
would help take care
of her if anything

315
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.460
were to happen to her beloved.

316
00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.160
But what comes next
will set in motion

317
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.340
a sequence of events that
will shape the future

318
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.860
for generations to come.

319
00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.890
Then it focuses down
on to the moment where

320
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.190
everyone holds their breath.

321
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.840
What happens is
the bridegroom is

322
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.740
then handed a pitcher of wine.

323
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.070
The groom then pours wine
into a ceremonial cup

324
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.190
that will be offered to
his desired bride-to-be.

325
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.960
And it was called
the cup of joy.

326
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.520
With both hands. reverently.
and respectfully. and fearfully.

327
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.900
he would pass it to his bride.

328
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:35.160
When the groom presents the cup.
she now has the choice as to

329
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.340
whether or not she
will accept or reject

330
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.620
this proposal for marriage.

331
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.910
The moment the cup is
handed to the bride.

332
00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:51.600
she's given all power
to stop the wedding

333
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:57.400
by pushing the cup back and
rejecting the bridegroom.

334
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.730
Contrary to all other wedding
customs in the Middle East.

335
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:05.360
the bride in a Galilean wedding
possessed the final authority.

336
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.470
She alone had the power
to accept or reject

337
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.730
the offer from the groom.

338
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.190
The betrothal could
not be completed

339
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.400
without her willing acceptance
to drink from the cup of wine.

340
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.240
But on this day. during this
betrothal. the bride accepts.

341
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.730
The groom will then also
take and drink from the cup.

342
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.040
solidifying the new covenant.

343
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.008
But then he says
something truly profound.

344
00:23:08.008 --> 00:23:10.710
And then the bridegroom
says publicly

345
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.560
so everyone can hear.
"You are now consecrated

346
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.950
to me by the laws of Moses. and
I will not drink of this cup

347
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:22.650
again until I drink it anew
with you in my father's house."

348
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.590
But to understand why this
phrase is so profound.

349
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.500
we must look at
another act recorded

350
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.820
later in the scriptures.

351
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.420
During the Last Supper.
Jesus offered a cup of wine

352
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.720
to his disciples to signify
a new covenant with them.

353
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.780
And after his disciples
drank from the cup.

354
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.240
Jesus then said
something similar to what

355
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.500
a Galilean would have heard
from their own weddings.

356
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.300
He said--

357
00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:03.910
But I say to you. I will not
drink of this fruit of the vine

358
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.620
from now on until that day
when I drink it new with you

359
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.570
in my father's kingdom.

360
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:16.040
This is exactly why when
He gave them the cup.

361
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:21.140
He actually says this is the
new covenant in my blood.

362
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.950
I'm about to pour my blood.

363
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.600
It's a promise.

364
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.820
We're going to be
together again.

365
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.870
and we're going to mark
it by drinking the wine.

366
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.670
It's something important.

367
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.170
The breaking of bread
and offering of wine--

368
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.890
these acts were to form a
new union. a new promise.

369
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.070
meant to deliberately
set in motion events

370
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.230
of unimaginable importance.

371
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.170
In my Arab culture. you
eat from the same bread

372
00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.020
and you drink from the same cup.

373
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.370
The thought is that. that
which is in you is in me.

374
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.520
It is a common
union. comm-union--

375
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.190
no longer two. but one.

376
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:14.240
When Jesus says that
at that Last Supper.

377
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.740
this is my body given
for you. broken for you.

378
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.650
He is talking as a
bridegroom to his bride.

379
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.850
When He says to
them. this is the cup

380
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.150
of my blood in the
new covenant. that's

381
00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.060
how they would
seal the betrothal

382
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.220
in the ancient wedding.

383
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.890
Well. when you think about
the Galilean disciples.

384
00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.530
they understood
exactly what it was

385
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.880
saying regarding these things.

386
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.680
They were familiar things.

387
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.950
The illustration was
entirely clear to them.

388
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.770
When Jesus said
that. his Galilean

389
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.105
disciples at the Last Supper
heard only one thing--

390
00:25:53.105 --> 00:25:53.905
wedding.

391
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:03.110
In fact. this might explain
why later in the gospel records

392
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.930
the disciples asked
Jesus only when

393
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:11.060
the events of the last days
would take place and not why--

394
00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.130
because as Galileans.
they likely

395
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:16.430
had already made the
connection. especially given

396
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.700
Jesus's first recorded
miracle. which took place

397
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.870
in the town of Cana when
he turned water into wine

398
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.740
at a Galilean wedding.

399
00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:31.720
And I find this most fascinating
that the first miracle

400
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.870
Jesus ever performed
was at a wedding.

401
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.850
And that wedding had the
same cultural dynamic

402
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.880
that Jesus was
describing when he

403
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.500
was explaining to his disciples
about his soon return.

404
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.760
But the conclusion of
the betrothal was merely

405
00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.040
the first step on a
year's-long journey

406
00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.540
to an unimaginable conclusion.

407
00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.850
Now the betrothal
ceremony is finished.

408
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.460
and the families rejoicing.
partying in the streets.

409
00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.020
go back to their houses.

410
00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.850
But this is just
the beginning. now.

411
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.710
of an entire year
of preparations

412
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.650
that goes into making
the way for the wedding.

413
00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.490
And though. technically.
the bride and groom are now

414
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.250
united as one under
a new covenant.

415
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.945
the real work only now begins.

416
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.540
The groom must
leave his betrothed.

417
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:36.120
where they will live apart until
the day of their wedding feast.

418
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.970
In fact. the groom is
now responsible for all

419
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.710
of the preparations
for the day he will

420
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.570
be reunited with his bride.

421
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.590
Over the following months. he
will acquire materials to build

422
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:54.740
a new room onto
his father's house.

423
00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.510
along with crafting
new furniture.

424
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.115
such as tables and stools.

425
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:04.850
He'll negotiate for required
items. such as oil lamps. rugs.

426
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.220
and dishes that will be used
in the wedding feast that will

427
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.330
take place in their new home.

428
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.520
And scholars have
now discovered that

429
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.180
the theological implications
of this period in the wedding

430
00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.760
held profound
importance regarding

431
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.590
the first coming of Christ.

432
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.360
You see. before
Jesus's crucifixion.

433
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.150
He warned his disciples that He
too would have to leave them.

434
00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.530
Jesus tells them--

435
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:41.080
I go to prepare a place for you.

436
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.410
And if I go and prepare
a place for you.

437
00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:53.250
I will come again and receive
you to myself. that where I am.

438
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:57.260
there you may be also.

439
00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.970
I'm going to prepare
a place for you.

440
00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.710
This is key. especially
when we think

441
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.710
about the first century
Galilean experience and culture.

442
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.260
I'm going away.

443
00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.690
A Galilean would have
understood that perfectly

444
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:13.080
to mean that he's going to go
away to prepare a new home.

445
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.240
He's going to go prepare a
place for his bride. personally.

446
00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.750
And then Jesus said something
that they all understood.

447
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.780
I'm going to come back and
get you. that where I am.

448
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.210
there you may be also.

449
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:31.130
But then He's not leaving before
He's making a verbal promise

450
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:35.810
that He's about to come back
and take us. and where He is.

451
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:37.250
we will also be.

452
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.140
And it's very important
that we understand

453
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.670
He's not saying so where
you are. I will also be.

454
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.320
It's where I am.
you will also be.

455
00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:50.840
He is speaking as a bridegroom
to his bride. and they knew it.

456
00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.440
They knew it. because this
was the culture of that day.

457
00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.750
It is so tragic. for
lack of a better word.

458
00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:02.720
they don't understand the
profound depth of the culture.

459
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.460
You cannot separate the
culture from the gospels.

460
00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.720
If you take the culture
out of the gospels.

461
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.710
you virtually gut out
the entire meaning of it.

462
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.540
But unlike the earthly
custom. where the groom

463
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.600
will bring his bride back
to his father's house.

464
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.240
Jesus was speaking in a
heavenly realm. where only

465
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.620
those that are born again.
having agreed to be his bride.

466
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.470
could go.

467
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:33.570
It's Jesus who introduced the
doctrine of the rapture to us.

468
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.220
I'm going to come
and pick you up.

469
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.835
take you back where I've been.

470
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:39.300
You need to
understand something.

471
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.810
if you don't have that event
taking place in your theology.

472
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.730
you've got the wrong Jesus.

473
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.190
If Jesus doesn't come
back for his church.

474
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.500
then we all have
the wrong Jesus.

475
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.090
He so has to come back.
that it's mandatory.

476
00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.880
It is absolutely a
definitive event.

477
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.760
It defines either we have the
right Jesus or the wrong Jesus

478
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.670
based upon the biblical
Jesus coming back or not.

479
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.210
He has to come back.

480
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.750
He said. I'm going
away. but I'm going away

481
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.470
to prepare a place for you.

482
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.500
Then I'm going to come back. and
I'm going to bring you to me.

483
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.400
Well?

484
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.640
Hello. that sounds
to me like a rapture.

485
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.400
And this is further
reinforced by Christ himself

486
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.090
when He tells his disciples
that when this time comes.

487
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.310
there will be those
living on the Earth

488
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.870
that will not taste death.

489
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.090
But until that time
when the groom can

490
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.980
be reunited with
his bride. there is

491
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:47.268
much that needs to take place.

492
00:31:47.268 --> 00:31:51.080
And although the groom has
left to prepare a new home.

493
00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.210
the bride's job is
not yet over either.

494
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.050
She must prepare for
the hour that her groom

495
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:06.120
will return for her.

496
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.070
The bride then
takes the next year

497
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:16.670
to put together a wedding
dress and other accouterments

498
00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:17.990
for the particular wedding.

499
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.750
She's got to buy
with her bridesmaids

500
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:24.260
all kinds of pieces of cloth.

501
00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.680
The bride and her bridesmaids
would either weave or acquire

502
00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.840
fabrics for the bride's dress.

503
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.180
Smaller towns in the
region. being separated

504
00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.310
from more populated
areas. may not

505
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.560
have the materials
readily available

506
00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.330
to complete an elaborate gown.

507
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.340
The bride would
often have to wait

508
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.490
for traveling merchants that
would sell what was needed.

509
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.670
These preparations could
become a difficult and costly

510
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.710
task that in the first century
could take months to complete.

511
00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.750
But that wasn't all.

512
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.570
Even after the wedding
gown was completed.

513
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.910
the bride also needed
to remain vigilant

514
00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.000
and pure as she
waited for her groom.

515
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.040
no matter how long it took.

516
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:18.260
The bride was to be
always ready for her groom

517
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.050
to come back and take
her to that place

518
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.700
that he had prepared for her.

519
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.280
The bride would just
not sit and wait.

520
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.250
The bride was to occupy
until her bridegroom came.

521
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.950
And this is where things
get very interesting.

522
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.410
Typically in Galilee.
around one year

523
00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:41.170
would pass while preparations
were being made for the wedding

524
00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.300
feast at the father's house.

525
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.930
But recently uncovered evidence
has exposed new insight

526
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.820
that is sending shock
waves throughout

527
00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.820
the theological community.

528
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.790
During this entire
process to now.

529
00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.790
neither the groom nor
the bride actually

530
00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:01.445
knew when the day or the hour
of the wedding would take place.

531
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.260
The exact minute of the
actual ceremony of the wedding

532
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.324
was not known.

533
00:34:10.324 --> 00:34:13.820
Yeah. the bride just did
not know the day or the hour

534
00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.760
that her bridegroom was coming.
so she always had to be ready.

535
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.600
In fact. no one in
the entire town knew--

536
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.639
no one. that is.
except for one person.

537
00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:32.810
No one knew the day or
the hour of this wedding--

538
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.659
not the son. not anyone else--

539
00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:39.500
only the father
of the bridegroom.

540
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.949
Only the father of the groom
knew the day and the hour

541
00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:45.080
that the wedding
would take place--

542
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.770
the one who read the
conditions on behalf of his son

543
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.600
during the betrothal--

544
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.650
the one that provided payment
to obtain a bride for his son.

545
00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.030
He and he alone holds
the secret to when

546
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.870
the wedding will take
place. the hour that his son

547
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.550
can retrieve his bride.

548
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.160
All the types of
weddings in the regions.

549
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.460
whether among Arabs.
Jews. or other people.

550
00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.760
were all predictable.

551
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.860
You would take a year to
prepare for that wedding.

552
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.810
but at the end of that
year. the wedding would

553
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:20.240
take place on a designated day.

554
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.000
This is what made a Galilean
wedding different than all

555
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.410
the weddings in the area.

556
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:27.330
Because the bridegroom would
finish building his room.

557
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.467
He would finish with the feast.

558
00:35:28.467 --> 00:35:29.600
And then he would
go to his father

559
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.770
and say. father I'm done.

560
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.110
I want my bride.

561
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.810
And the father would
say. I'll tell you when.

562
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:39.320
For the Galileans. it
was a surprise wedding.

563
00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.130
The son would go home
to the father's house.

564
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:44.720
And in the Middle
East they do this.

565
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.610
but specifically you
see this in the Galilee

566
00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:51.200
to this day. where the
son adds onto the house.

567
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.430
It's one portion built upon
another. extending the home.

568
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.110
enlarging the home.

569
00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:00.290
And so the father
would have been

570
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.750
the one with absolute
preview over what's going on.

571
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:08.990
It's the father who tells the
son. that's it. you're done.

572
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:12.980
And then the father would
give the announcement. son.

573
00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.180
go get your bride.

574
00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.640
The father would be
the one who would

575
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.700
determine the day and the hour.

576
00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.670
And he would say to the
groom. OK. now's the time.

577
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:24.500
The day and hour has come.

578
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.770
The bridal chamber. that
place that you've prepared

579
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:30.290
was complete. he
would say. OK. now.

580
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:31.400
This is the day.

581
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.570
This is the hour.

582
00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:33.680
Go get your bride.

583
00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:38.420
This goes back now to
several accounts in the Bible

584
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.950
where Jesus tells his
disciples that no one knows

585
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.900
the day or the hour
when I'm going to come.

586
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.900
They wanted to know if He was
going to establish the kingdom.

587
00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.450
And He says. no. no. no.
you don't understand.

588
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:54.560
No one knows when I'm going
to come back for my bride.

589
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.110
The only person that could send
the bridegroom to get the bride

590
00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.070
was the father.

591
00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:01.610
The only person that could send
Jesus to come back to the Earth

592
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.490
is his father.

593
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:07.880
You see. during
Jesus's first coming.

594
00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.970
when his disciples asked when
He would return at the end

595
00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:15.650
of days. He also told them--

596
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:20.480
But of that day and
hour no one knows.

597
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:27.530
not even the angels in
heaven. nor the son.

598
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.350
but only the father.

599
00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:35.660
Jesus himself. I
believe. demonstrated

600
00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:42.320
the genuine Galilean tradition
by saying not even the son

601
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.810
knows the day and the hour.

602
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:49.310
At the moment of his promise to
the disciples that He's coming

603
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:55.940
to take them. at the moment
of his description of the end.

604
00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:04.560
He was telling his disciples no
one knows the day or the hour.

605
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.610
But although Jesus himself says
He will not know the exact time

606
00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.640
of his return based on
prophesied events that would

607
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.880
take place at the end
of days. the gospels

608
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.440
make it clear that we could
know the approaching season

609
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.940
in which the end of our
age would take place.

610
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.810
The day is drawing near. so
he's got to get the feast out.

611
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.550
But still. he doesn't know
the day when it's happening.

612
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.480
He's got a lot of help putting
it together. because there

613
00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.110
could be 50 to 100 people
attending this thing.

614
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.330
and he's got to feed
them not just for one day

615
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.650
but for several days.

616
00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.260
The bridegroom is
finished with the feast.

617
00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.950
He's finished
putting it together.

618
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.470
He's got the room
built. He calls

619
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:51.090
upon his father
to inspect it all.

620
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.500
which is more of a formality.

621
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.230
And the father finally says.
yes. son. it's ready to go.

622
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.960
The son says. I want my bride.

623
00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.710
And the father says.
I'll tell you when.

624
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.600
But remember. this
is a bridegroom who's

625
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.330
waiting for the moment when
his father taps him and says.

626
00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:09.320
go get her.

627
00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.660
He's excited. he's thrilled.

628
00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.050
And when Jesus is
in heaven right now.

629
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:18.270
wow. I can't even begin to
picture what's going on.

630
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.990
but he's got to be
loving his bride.

631
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:23.900
saying I can't wait
to come back and take

632
00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.680
you to be with me where I am.

633
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:35.750
And although the groom has now
completed the preparations.

634
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.550
he still has to
wait for the moment

635
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.360
that his father will tell
him to go get his bride.

636
00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.830
And during this
same time. the bride

637
00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.560
would also be
prepared and waiting.

638
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.190
equally as eager to be united
forever with her beloved.

639
00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.670
But as the sun sets on
the town this evening.

640
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:05.500
the time of waiting
is nearly finished.

641

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

643
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:23.750
This brings us to a topic
that's fiercely debated today.

644
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:27.050
Since the origin of Christ's
message left with the Galileans

645
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.200
has faded into history.
Jesus's statements

646
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.040
regarding not knowing the
day or the hour of his return

647
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.730
has sparked heated debate
and growing misconceptions.

648
00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.420
And the church has
suffered from this.

649
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.580
And that is. there are
those who want to set dates.

650
00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.400
And yet the Bible teaches
both from Jesus himself

651
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.880
and from the apostles that no
man knows the day or the hour.

652
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.360
It is my belief that
these date setters.

653
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.980
so-called. have irreversibly
damaged Bible prophecy.

654
00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:01.570
I grieve about the
obsession of when will it

655
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.640
happen. as far as day and hour.

656
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.640
When you start setting days
and then it doesn't happen.

657
00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.700
then you have
millions or hundreds

658
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.090
of thousands of disappointed
people that. good chances.

659
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:14.830
that they'll walk
away from that faith

660
00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:17.230
because it wasn't proved right.

661
00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.300
And the result is
that Bible prophecy

662
00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.840
is being systematically
erased from Christianity

663
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.680

664
00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.670
I'm just so stunned.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:33.200
I never thought I would
see this in my lifetime

666
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.200

news in the Bible

great criticism and skepticism.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:45.790
And then you talk to a pastor.
and he'll say. you know what?

670

identified with the fringe.

the hour. and we don't.

Nobody's got any
special insight.

674
00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.590
It's a secret. apparently.
only God the Father knows.

675
00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:02.980
Look. when you
live in this world

676
00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.960
and suddenly someone
tells you you're

677
00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.800
about to be taken physically
out of this world.

678
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:12.280
then knowing the day is
like hitting the jackpot.

679
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:18.220
However. it saddens me that
even though Jesus himself said

680
00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.870
no one knows the
day and the hour.

681
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.540
why do we think that
we need to know?

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:39.000
In addition. with
spreading misconceptions

687
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.120
of biblical prophecy. more
churchgoing Christians

688
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.580
with each passing
year no longer want

689
00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:48.330
to hear about these
so-called fringe topics.

690
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:53.890
And most churches have
clearly recognized this trend.

691
00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:57.030
And if you ask a pastor.
he will tell you flat-out.

692
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.500
"You know what?

693
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.040
The world is coming to end is
not going to grow my church.

694
00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.700
The fact that even Jesus is
coming back is not going to."

695
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.580
That is the number
one reason. actually.

696
00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:12.690
And it's really because
pastors are themselves ignorant

697
00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.060
concerning Bible prophecy.

698
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.530
They're also fearful.

699
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:20.160
They're fearful that if they
start teaching Bible prophecy--

700
00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.020
I mean. really. they're
teaching the Bible.

701
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.330
so how can you not
teach the Bible.

702
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.310
the whole counsel
of God. without also

703
00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.710
teaching prophecy by default?

704
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:32.670
But they're fearful that it's
going to be too controversial.

705
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:36.330
Christians always want to
be accepted by the world.

706
00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:39.300
They are always on
the run to adopt

707
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.650
and embrace worldly views in
order for people to like them.

708
00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:45.450
You sugarcoat everything.

709
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:49.380
You become a motivational
speaker rather than a pastor.

710
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.210
Because if you come
to an unbeliever

711
00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:53.140
and you pull out
this rapture card.

712
00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.425
he's going to run away from you.

713
00:43:54.425 --> 00:43:55.525
He's going to
think you're crazy.

714
00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:00.900
And this growing trend
of marginalizing Bible

715
00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.500
prophecy is not merely
an unfounded perception.

716
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.010
It's proven to be happening
and likely far worse

717
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.500
than you believe.

718
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.660
Let me take you to
a more qualitative

719
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.400
study we did several years ago.

720
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.410
We took 450 of those sermons
from different pastors.

721
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:23.400
and just took those as a sample
and looked at those sermons.

722
00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:27.870
Only 2% of those were
preached from a passage

723
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:32.740
of scripture that would be a
prophetic book of the Bible.

724
00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.830
Here's why this is a problem.

725
00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:40.120
The culmination of prophetic
events make up almost 1/3

726
00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.160
of the entire Bible.

727
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:46.480
The findings that on
any given day only 2%

728
00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.420
of sermons contained
anything prophetic

729
00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.940
means that churches
are intentionally

730
00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.940
marginalizing the topic.

731
00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:59.500
I think that when you take 30%
of the Bible and you ignore it.

732
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.570
then your understanding
of the other 70%

733
00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:02.860
is going to be flawed.

734
00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.800
The Bible cannot be dissected.

735
00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.470
You cannot just
choose what you want.

736
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:11.650
As to why it is that
Christians today

737
00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:14.770
are dismissive of
the Lord's return.

738
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:19.690
I would connect the dots
with Biblical illiteracy.

739
00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:21.670
And here's the thing.

740
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:25.420
I'm sad to say that it's
the fault of the pastor

741
00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.100
behind the pulpit.

742
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.370
Churches are going to
tell you. you know what?

743
00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.410
I want to live my full life.

744
00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:34.990
I want to see my
children grow up.

745
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:36.040
I want to see my grand--

746
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.250
I don't want to think about
end of the world issues.

747
00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:45.340
And I think that is what so
threw me. is that the fact that

748
00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:49.150
the King is coming. we have a
glorious home prepared for us.

749
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:53.470
we're going to go to that place
eternally. became negative.

750
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:56.590
became a downer.

751
00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:59.710
But the bigger problem
is that you cannot remove

752
00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:02.230
prophecy from the
Bible without also

753
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:06.440
removing the return of Christ.

754
00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:11.320
I absolutely believe that the
rapture is a fundamental belief

755
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.940
in Christianity.

756
00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:18.580
Eschatology. Bible prophecy.
is of paramount importance.

757
00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.550
Nearly 1/3 of the
Bible is prophecy.

758
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:24.460
so you cannot have
the whole counsel

759
00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:28.210
of God without also having
the prophetic word of God.

760
00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.890
It's the gospel.

761
00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.830
The gospel is that Jesus came.

762
00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:37.870
He was crucified. buried.
rose again. on the third day.

763
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.600
and is coming back
again one day.

764
00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:44.930
If you take the return of
Jesus Christ out of the gospel.

765
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:46.540
you gut the gospel out.

766
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:54.380
But even worse yet.
the unintended result

767
00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.680
of prophecy being systematically
removed from churches

768
00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.650
and educational institutes
is that the world

769
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:05.400
is forgetting why prophecy
exists in the first place.

770
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:12.990
It's so that God can prove
to the world that He is God.

771
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.960
The point to all of this is
that if you remove prophecy

772
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:20.480
from the Bible. you remove
the proof that the Bible

773
00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.100
is from a divine source.

774
00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.190
It would place the remaining
scriptures of the Bible

775
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:31.520
on par with other religious
teachings in the world.

776
00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.560
With all things
perceived as equal.

777
00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.480
the Bible would
be seen as no more

778
00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:39.770
relevant or divine than any
other so-called holy book.

779
00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:45.800
This is actually why it is
that young people today want

780
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.990
nothing to do with the church.

781
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:55.400
The number one reason that
many today don't believe

782
00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.290
is because there's no evidence.

783
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:58.880
You know. what's
interesting is Jesus said.

784
00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.300
I have told you what's going
to happen before it happens.

785
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:06.380
So when it happens. you
will believe that I am.

786
00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.000
There is so much evidence.

787
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.100
And the problem
is that many today

788
00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.620
do not believe
because they do not

789
00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.115
see the evidence that is there.

790
00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:21.700
And only one thing
could come from this--

791
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.190
a falling away of
those that believe

792
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.490
Christ will return and even
in the validity of the Bible

793
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:29.050
itself--

794
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:34.360
a terrifying trend
that has already begun.

795
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:40.150
So my mother and father
immigrated to America

796
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.700
from the Middle
East. and the America

797
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:48.820
that they came to in 1963
is not the America today.

798
00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.880
It has changed dramatically.

799
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.960
There was a day when
there was this knowledge

800
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.470
of the Lord's return.

801
00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:01.930
You talk about it today.
and it almost reminds me

802
00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.990
of what Peter said about
how that there is coming

803
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:09.400
a day that they will mock
and scoff any mention

804
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.600
of the Lord's return.

805
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.640
"Where's the promise
of his coming?

806
00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.570
They've been saying that for
generations and generations.

807
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.460
yet he does not come."

808
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.880
Well. I think that's all a
part of the end-time apostasy.

809
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.150
Everything we're talking
about. it was prophesied.

810
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:26.290
it's happening.

811
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:29.440
I think one of the things
that plays into here

812
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.300
is what the Bible
calls the great falling

813
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:35.650
away. the great fall
from truth into apostasy.

814
00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.710
And this is not simply a
perceived social change

815
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.680
from different generational
perspectives but one that

816
00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.480
is being exposed
through findings

817
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:50.560
from various organizations.
such as LifeWay research.

818
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:55.060
the Barna Group
and Pew Research.

819
00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.090
We see that only
about 15% are bought

820
00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:01.900
in to evangelical teaching
indicating that Jesus Christ is

821
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.410
the only way to remove their
sin and that Jesus Christ alone

822
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:07.487
is how somebody can
see eternal life

823
00:50:07.487 --> 00:50:08.620
and that they ought
to share that.

824
00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:09.940
More than eight
out of 10 Americans

825
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:14.050
would have some hesitancy
or maybe completely dismiss

826
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.870
the core evangelical beliefs
of putting the Bible first

827
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:20.640
and believing in Christ alone.

828
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.720
According to multiple in-depth
studies from various research

829
00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.290
organizations. more
than 80% of Americans

830
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:31.490
no longer believe that the Bible
is the complete word of God--

831
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:35.060
a trend that isn't surprising
when considering the proof

832
00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:37.220
for the validity
of the Bible itself

833
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:40.520
is being systematically erased.

834
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.340
With all religions being
viewed more with each passing

835
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.460
year as being equal
and without substance.

836
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.850
a global trend of
humanism is exploding.

837
00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:53.630
We're up to almost one
out of four Americans

838
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:56.270
indicating. "I don't
really feel like I'm

839
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:58.040
a part of any religious group."

840
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.850
On that same survey. we
did ask whether people

841
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:05.870
believe the world will
end in their lifetime.

842
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:09.050
And less than one out of
five. 18% of Americans.

843
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:12.866
actually believe that the world
will end within their lifetime.

844
00:51:12.866 --> 00:51:15.000
[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

845
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.180
Since the return of Christ
is synonymous with the end

846
00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.490
of the world as we
know it. this may

847
00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:23.700
lend some associative insight
into the trends we're beginning

848
00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.580
to see in why most
people no longer believe

849
00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.340
that Jesus is going to return.

850
00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.520
And surprisingly. the
scriptures foretold

851
00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:34.230
this. too. was going to happen.

852
00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:40.520
I know you have a
little strength.

853
00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:44.810
This describes this
church in the last days

854
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:48.950
prior to the return of Jesus
Christ as just hanging on.

855
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:52.250
There are a remnant of
believers today that

856
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:56.360

numbers and growing

858
00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:02.270

859
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:04.080
Jesus said that
when He comes back.

860
00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.900
we'll even find
faith on the Earth.

861
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.700
We know that in the
last days. there's

862
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.460
going to be a diminishing
of people believing.

863
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.500
I believe that what is
happening in America

864
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:17.210
is that the westernized
version of. can I say.

865
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:20.690
a man-made Christianity
is failing.

866
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:22.040
It's failing in faith.

867
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.410
It's failing in its ability
to engage the culture.

868
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:27.300
It's failing to be ready. to
be busy about our Father's

869
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.100
business.

870
00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:29.610
It's failing in evangelism.

871
00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:30.410
Why?

872
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:31.970
There's no sense of urgency.

873
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:33.620
And so we live in
a time when there

874
00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.780
are those saying that
they believe in the Bible

875
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.010
and believe in Jesus.

876
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:40.100
I have to ask the question.
what Bible are you reading.

877
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:43.100
and which Jesus are
you talking about?

878
00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:47.160
When you're completely
detached from the word of God.

879
00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.770
then the rapture sounds crazy.

880
00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:51.870
Although the same people
who may reject God

881
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:53.160
will believe in aliens.

882
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.280
They will believe in
going to the psychic

883
00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.380
and hearing from the
dead and all of that.

884
00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:01.480
They believe in so
many weird things.

885
00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:05.680
But when you talk
about Bible stories.

886
00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.070
they will immediately say
these are fairy tales.

887
00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:11.080
And it's interesting.
because we found

888
00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:15.820
physical evidences to almost
every single miraculous story

889
00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.260
in the scriptures.

890
00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.450
Again. the Bible declares
that in the last days

891
00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:22.060
there's going to be those
who will say. where's

892
00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.970
the promise of his coming?

893
00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:26.680
Everything has been continuing
on since the beginning.

894
00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.980
And they mock-- the Bible says
in the last days there's going

895
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.450
to be mockers. and there's
going to be those that make

896
00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:33.520
light of the return of Jesus.

897
00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.770
Not only is it
going to get worse.

898
00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:39.290
it's going to get
exponentially worse.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.830
Considering these trends.
it's not surprising

901
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:05.430
that this is precisely why
the scriptures famously warned

902
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:08.520
that in the last days.
Jesus will return

903

as a thief in the
night into a world that

904
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:17.080
is unbelieving and unprepared.

905
00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:22.120
Jesus warned his disciples to
be ready for his second coming.

906
00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.370
He said He would come
like a thief in the night.

the seasons. my brethren.

that I should tell

you because you perfectly know.

910
00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:34.420
The day of the Lord indeed
will come to this world

as a thief in the night.

Jesus returning as
a thief in the night

923
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:17.570
to those unprepared in the last
days appear self-explanatory.

And for years.
theologians interpreted

925
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.050
the meaning at face value.

926
00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:26.290
But you see. in
ancient Galilee. we

927
00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:30.260
know that only the father of the
groom knew the day and the hour

928
00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:32.830
that the wedding
would take place.

929
00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:35.350
But what researchers
have now discovered

930
00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:41.510
is that the hour would be
in the middle of the night.

931
00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:48.620
Well. even the idiom of. "no
man knows the day or the hour."

932
00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:52.220
the idiom of. "as a thief in
the night." they in that day

933
00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:56.480
would have absolutely understand
exactly what Jesus was saying

934
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.880
when he uses those expressions.

935
00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.390
They knew it was literally going
to be as a thief in the night.

936
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:04.280
and it would be in
the night. which again

937
00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.850
was why they had to
have oil in their lamps

938
00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:08.300
and their lamps lit--

939
00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.680
so that it would
not be as a thief.

940
00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:10.790
They were ready.

941
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:12.230
They were dressed and ready.

942
00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:22.230
This was the ultimate surprise
twist on the Galilean wedding.

943
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:24.780
and Jesus. who lived
among them for years.

944
00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.820
knew this all too well--

945
00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:29.700
that the groom would
come for the bride

946
00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.050
in the middle of the night.

947
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:35.900
Her life was pure.

948
00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:38.450
She slept in her wedding dress.

949
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:41.180
Her bridesmaids were dressed
in their white linen garments.

950
00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:44.420
and they were ready to help
her out should the bridegroom

951
00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:46.700
come-- which he was
coming unexpectedly

952
00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.590
at an hour she didn't know--

953
00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:50.910
so that she could be
ready to meet him.

954
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:54.030
They will do that in the middle
of the night for a reason.

955
00:56:54.030 --> 00:57:02.480
It's to basically declare that
it can happen when everybody

956
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:06.470
else are not necessarily ready.

957
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:08.240
It is deliberate.

958
00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.090
And that's why only
the people that

959
00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:12.710
have an active
part in the wedding

960
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:15.050
are excited and are ready.

961
00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:18.860
But those that are not are
completely-- they're asleep.

962
00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.990
They are literally asleep.

963
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:22.500
Yes. exactly.

964
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.880
And that's why we're told not
to fall asleep as others do.

965
00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:28.670
That's why one of
the reasons. I think.

966
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:33.470
Christians should
always look for is. what

967
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:36.710
are the signs that Jesus
gave to the disciples.

968
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:37.950
and are we seeing them?

[AMBIENT MUSIC]

970
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.200
And though Jesus returning
as a thief in the night

971
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.020
was directed to the
unprepared world.

972
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.390
He also gave another
warning directed more

973
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:58.300
to those that would be
waiting for his return

974
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.310
at the end of days--

975
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.860
a parable that
warns how even those

976
00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:09.360
that believe they are prepared
can end up left in the dark.

977
00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.350
Jesus spoke about 10 bridesmaids
in the night prepared

978
00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:15.150
and with oil burning
in their lamps

979
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:17.340
waiting for the
arrival of the groom.

980
00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:20.850
which would come at any hour.

981
00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:22.350
So you've got the
parable of those

982
00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:23.940
with the oil in the lamps.

983
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:25.530
You've got 10 of them.

984
00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:30.000
You've got all 10 who started.
but not all 10 finished.

985
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.480
You say. yeah. yeah. they did.

986
00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.340
No. they didn't.

987
00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:35.610
The Bible says that at the
time of the midnight cry.

988
00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:38.610
they all jumped up and
trimmed their lamps.

989
00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:42.120
but only five had enough
oil to continue on.

990
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.170
And this is key.

991
00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:44.970
Symbolically in
scripture. the oil

992
00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:47.830
is a reference to the
Holy Spirit in your life.

993
00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:50.280
And so you can be a
believer-- listen carefully--

994
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:53.280
Jesus said these are they
who believe for a while.

995
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.350
It doesn't mean you're
born again to believe.

996
00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:58.770
Has your belief brought
you to faith in Christ?

997
00:58:58.770 --> 00:59:01.230
So these virgins were religious.

998
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:02.730
These virgins were ready.

These virgins were waiting.

1000
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:05.230
They had lamps.

1001
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:06.120
They had oil.

1002
00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:11.870
But only the ones that had
enough oil made it to the end.

1003
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:15.240
The application for this
today is quite clear.

With recently exposed
social trends.

1005
00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:20.700
many believe that this
prophetic warning from Jesus

1006
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:24.090
himself regarding the
church in the last days

will retrieve his bride.

1030
01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:19.550
He wakes him and says.
go get your bride.

1031
01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:28.930
The son leaps to his feet. and
he grabs a shofar. a ram's horn

1032
01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:32.800
trumpet. and he lets go a blast
to wake up the entire village.

1033
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.250
It's a marvelous scene.

1034
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:37.390
But it's meant to wake
up not only the village.

1035

but the bride and her family.

midnight. where the bride

1039

executing her preparedness.

groom is finally on his way

not only wake the bride.

invited to the wedding feast.

1059
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:21.450

the bride in the middle-- all

their white linen robes.

1061
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:26.070
and in the center.
the bride dressed

1062
01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:27.990
in her beautiful bridal gown.

1063
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.450
After a year of
preparing and waiting.

1064
01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:38.500

together again--

1065

1066
01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.330
The parade led by
the bridegroom now

1067
01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:04.520
rush up towards the
bride and her family--

1068
01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.020
and all the people that
are standing there.

1069
01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.130
the bridesmaids.

1070
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:08.840
And the two men
with the litter set

1071
01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.560
the litter down on the
ground in front of the bride.

1072
01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.220
And she very. very modestly
steps out onto the litter.

1073
01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:22.180
and she lowers herself down.

1074
01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.470
The bride did not
simply follow her groom

1075
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:30.230
back to the father's house. but
she was lifted into the air.

1076
01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.620
In fact. the ancient Galileans
referred to this moment

1077
01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:45.070
as "flying the bride
to the father's house."

1078
01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:56.270
She's lifted up off the ground.

1079
01:04:56.270 --> 01:05:00.560
She's escorted with him back
to that place of preparation.

1080
01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.440
It speaks. it shouts.
all about God's grace.

1081
01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.060
It's not her efforts.

1082
01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:07.620
She was just to be ready
because she loves him.

1083
01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.380
She's borne aloft.

1084
01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.240
She's taken away with him.

1085
01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.610
It's all about the grace of God.

1086
01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:15.710
It's about the grace of
God from the beginning

1087
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:17.630
all the way through
to now. to the end.

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.790
There are multiple
chilling similarities

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:27.760
between this cultural
practice and descriptions

1090
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.610
throughout the Bible
regarding what theology

1091
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:34.050
has coined the rapture--

1092
01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:36.380
a moment that
believers are caught up

1093
01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.120
in the air to be
with the returning

1094
01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.370
messiah at the end of days.

1095
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.250
This makes me think of
something-- that when

1096
01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:48.250
the bride is lifted
off the ground.

1097
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:49.870
and they carry her
off the ground.

1098
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:52.680
as it were. flying her
to the father's house.

1099
01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.600
doesn't this sound
like Jesus collecting

1100
01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.690
his bride off the Earth
to join him in the air?

1101
01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:00.790
Absolutely. I believe that.

1102
01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.630

Without question.

1104
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:07.420
The clues that were
given in scripture

1105
01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:12.520
all speak with specificity to
this exactly being the rapture.

1106
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:15.850
This is the reason why
He's coming to take us.

1107
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:18.700
Why would a bridegroom
come and take the bride

1108
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:21.520
unless it's to marry her?

1109
01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.790
From that moment on. we will
always be with the Lord.

1110
01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:27.580
just like a husband
and a wife are one.

1111
01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.710
They cannot be
separated anymore.

1112
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:31.360
This is why I
believe the rapture

1113
01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.530

us in those parables.

1199
01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.145
He was warning.

[SHOUTING]

1201
01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.660
And just as with an
ancient Galilean wedding.

1202
01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:36.320
Bible prophecy warns that those
who missed the second coming

1203
01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.700
of the messiah are destined
to partake in the wrath of God

1204
01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.880
that will be poured out
upon a rejecting word.

1205
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.720
And the righteous will be
removed from the Earth.

1206

because the Lord there
says in Isaiah 26.

1207
01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.910
I will put them in
their place. I will shut

1208

who dwell on the Earth.

1211
01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:16.160
The fact that the church escapes
God's wrath is so important.

1212
01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.150
The church does not
escape man's wrath.

1213
01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:20.840
and we see that going on--

1214
01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:25.270
terrible persecution going on
in various parts of the world.

But the church.
biblically. scripturally.

1216
01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:31.610
God says that He's
going to spare

01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:33.298

[AMBIENT MUSIC]

1219
01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.830
When you look at
the whole picture.

1220
01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:49.600
the Galileans are really
the key to understanding

1221
01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.230
the why and what of the
second coming of Christ.

1222
01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:58.300
Jesus used this illustration
that they knew so intimately

1223
01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.360
over and over and over again--

1224
01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:05.650
that you have a bride who is
loved by a bridegroom. who is

1225
01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:08.620
betrothed to this bridegroom.

1226
01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:11.620
And the bridegroom is going
to make a covenant with her.

1227
01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.810
and then he's going to go away.

1228
01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:16.270
And eventually. when
they don't know.

1229
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:21.550
he's going to come back to take
her to be with him where he is.

1230
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:24.820
This is an amazing thing.
and it all stems from what

1231
01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:26.200
the Galileans understood.

1232
01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.000
And Jesus talked
to the Galileans

1233
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.450
like they were Galileans. so
that they would understand what

1234
01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:33.520
He meant when He said.
this is what it's

1235
01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.830
going to be like when I return.

1236
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:38.060
There are many people who
profess to be Christians that

1237
01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:41.110
are really not digging
into the details of what

1238
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:42.640
God has revealed about Himself.

1239
01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.020
After all. that's
what scripture is.

1240
01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.810
The number of those looking
to the return of Christ

1241
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:52.140
are diminishing with
each passing year.

1242
01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:55.530
and it's never been more
important to speak up about why

1243
01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:59.040
the messiah is coming back.

1244
01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.140
I have not given up by any
stretch of the imagination.

1245
01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:04.680
and that's based on what I
see happening in my events.

1246
01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.660
The attendees are
getting younger

1247
01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.320
and younger and younger.

1248
01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.530
So I have not given up.

1249
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:13.830
I just think they need
to identify with teachers

1250
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:16.660
who are their generation--
and they're rare.

1251
01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.070
but they do exist.

1252
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:26.320
And to the pastors. you need
to tell your congregations.

1253
01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.030
The influence of
pastors for those

1254
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:32.230
who attend church on a regular
basis. it is still very strong.

1255
01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:34.840
If I as a qualitative
researcher can

1256
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.900
pull from some fascinating
qualitative research

1257
01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.570
that we did on Bible
reading and what influenced

1258
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:41.980
people's Bible reading--

1259
01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:44.200
when a pastor suggests
something. and not

1260
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.100
just the passage the pastor
mentions in the sermon.

1261
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:51.790
but when a pastor suggests.
go home and read this.

1262
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:55.610
go home and look up this.
that has a big impact.

1263
01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:58.170
And I just think we
need to hang in there

1264
01:14:58.170 --> 01:15:02.480
and keep encouraging the
church and encouraging pastors.

1265
01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.870
They have one of the
toughest jobs on the planet.

1266
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:11.330
And those with media
influence need to speak out.

1267
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:13.480
Jesus died for his church.

1268
01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.950
He's coming back for his church.

1269
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:17.560
He loves his church.

1270
01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:23.390
And we all need to
tell the ones we love.

1271
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:27.380
If they choose to ignore
it. it's their fault.

1272
01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:40.150
But if you never warned
them. that's your fault.

1273
01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:43.620
We live in a nation founded
on Christian values.

1274
01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:47.230
yet followers of Christ are
choosing to remain silent.

1275
01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:55.070
We must be prepared to tell
others why Jesus is coming back

1276
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:57.440
so they too can make a choice.

1277
01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.460
It is our choice.

1278
01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:04.520
Jesus is not forced on anyone.

1279
01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:08.720
It is our own free
will and our choice

1280
01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:13.760
that we choose to accept
our proposal from Jesus

1281
01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.380
Christ as our bridegroom.

1282
01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.870
See. this is why Satan--

1283
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:20.900
again. the why-- why
Satan hates particularly

1284
01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:21.740
the Christian marriage.

1285
01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:24.620
He hates marriage because
of what it represents.

1286
01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:28.670
See. it's a microcosm of
what awaits in heaven.

1287
01:16:28.670 --> 01:16:32.150
We are the family of
God. our Heavenly Father.

It is a microcosm. a picture.
of that which has yet

1291
01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.870
to be fulfilled when it comes.

before the feast begins--

01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:17.720
before the rapture-- before
the thief comes in the night--

1295
01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:31.580
back to when it all
began. to the moment

1296
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.132
that you are offered his cup--

1297
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:48.130
the question is.
will you accept it?
