00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:47.965
<i>I was 28 years old when I died.</i>

4
00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:21.582
<i>My life started
in the Fifth Wards in Houston.</i>

5
00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.668
<i>Those were some of the toughest streets
in all of Texas.</i>

6
00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.171
Come on down.

7
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.299
<i>Nothing ever came easy.</i>

8
00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.009
<i>Every day was a fight.</i>

9
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:56.867
Oh. Lord.

10
00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:09.045
We'll have electric
soon as I can manage it.

11
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:20.516
Gloria.

12
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:22.309
Mary.

13
00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:25.354
Here you go. Roy.

14
00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:27.773
And George.

15
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.864
Thank God for the food first. y'all.

16
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:38.617
Bow your heads.

17
00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.705
Heavenly Father. thank you for this food.

18
00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.542
You know exactly what this family needs.

19
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.087
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.

20
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.880
-Amen.
-Amen.

21
00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:01.598
I'm so hungry. I could eat this table.

22
00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:09.231
Thank you. Mary.

23
00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.859
<i>Mary always saw the good in me.</i>

24
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.278
<i>I loved her for that.</i>

25
00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:30.544
Listen.

26
00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:35.299
I'll be going to work all day tomorrow.

27
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:39.428
so you follow Gloria to your new school
in the morning. You hear?

28
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:46.476
If you get held back another year.
you won't ever catch back up.

29
00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.899
So promise me you won't fight.

30
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.861
I promise.

31
00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:25.265
-Good morning. class.
-Good morning.

32
00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.768
Everyone turn to Page 16 in your books.

33
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.357
Who wants to read out loud?

34
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.796
Jason. take us away.

35
00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:59.508
"Texas is called the Lone Star State..."

36
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.285
What you looking at. Foreman?

37
00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:28.996
Nothing.

38
00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.623
What's wrong?
Can't you even afford a piece of bread?

39
00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:36.170
How about this nasty skin?

40
00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:37.713
You want it?

41
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.176
Go get it.

42
00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:46.763
George should change his name
from Foreman to "Poor-man."

43
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.766
It's Foreman.

44
00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:53.145
What's that. Poor-man?

45
00:05:58.317 --> 00:05:59.151
What?

46
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:05.532
What's my name now. fool?
Say it! Say my name!

47
00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:16.793
<i>Anger was my answer to everything.</i>

48
00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:21.798
<i>And I couldn't stop myself from fighting.</i>

49
00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:25.010
<i>It was the only thing I did well.</i>

50
00:07:41.837 --> 00:07:43.088
Excuse me. sir.

51
00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:46.008
Hey!

52
00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.928
-No!
-Get down.

53
00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:51.388
Hold his hands. man.

54
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.472
His wallet.

55
00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:55.642
Surprise. boys.

56
00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.478
Been busy around here. huh?

57
00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:04.443
Police! Stop right there!

58
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.304
They've gotta be somewhere around here.

59
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:43.232
Come on. Butch.

60
00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:47.444
Someone said they saw him over there.

61
00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.698
-Let me know what you see.
-Come on. boy. Find him.

62
00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.117
Find him.

63
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.119
Let's do it. boy. Go.

64
00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:01.250
You got something?

65
00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:03.418
Find him. boy.

66
00:09:03.502 --> 00:09:05.045
All right. Find him.

67
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.220
We got you. Find him!

68
00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:20.894
-Come on. boy.
-Try the next block over.

69
00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:22.896
Come on. boy.

70
00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.527
Let's go. He can't have gotten far.

71
00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.880
<i>If you left school
and you're between 16 and 22.</i>

72
00:09:47.963 --> 00:09:52.009
<i>Job Corps will teach you the skills
that can help you get a good job.</i>

73
00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.720
<i>In Job Corps.
you live at a Job Corps center.</i>

74
00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.847
<i>get free medical and dental care.</i>

75
00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.976
<i>clean clothes. your own bed to sleep in.
three square meals a day.</i>

76
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.187
<i>You even get paid while you're learning.</i>

77
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.106
<i>Just for once. give yourself a chance.</i>

78
00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:09.610
It's called the Job Corps.

79
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:18.035
You get an education and training.
so you can get a job.

80
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.621
They pay you a little each month too.

81
00:10:23.624 --> 00:10:25.375
And where will they send you?

82
00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:27.836
I don't know.

83
00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.089
Wherever they want. I guess.

84
00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:44.228
Look at me.

85
00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:47.773
You've got more inside
than what you're showing.

86
00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:50.275
I know it. Mom.

87
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.448
You wanna do this Job Corps?

88
00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.034
Yes.

89
00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.119
Then do it right. George.

90
00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:04.623
Don't come running back home
'cause you're missing me.

91
00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.001
Finish what you start this time.

92
00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.005
I will.

93
00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:24.268
We will teach you job skills.
We will give you training.

94
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:27.145
We will teach you respect for yourself.
as well as for others.

95
00:11:27.229 --> 00:11:30.274
We will show you a way forward.
no matter your past.

96
00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:31.358
Come on. son.

97
00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:35.404
Welcome to the Job Corps.
the start of your now-bright future.

98
00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:36.530
Here's your linens.

99
00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.906
Got a name. big guy?

100
00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:40.450
Yeah. I got a name.

101
00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:42.202
George Foreman.

102
00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:44.329
Barracks are gonna be
in the southwest corner.

103
00:11:44.413 --> 00:11:45.330
Lights out at 10.

104
00:11:45.414 --> 00:11:48.750
No drinking. no smoking.
no cursing. no women. no fighting.

105
00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:53.547
-Do y'all feed us here?
-Three meals a day at the chow hall.

106
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.091
Served by the one and only Mrs. Moon.

107
00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:15.903
It's just a bed. man.

108
00:13:17.673 --> 00:13:18.841
Turn that off.

109
00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:31.061
-Got something against music?
-Maybe I do.

110
00:13:32.563 --> 00:13:34.064
Are you always this pissed off?

111
00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.649
When I'm trying to study.

112
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.292
Now I know why you're here.

113
00:13:56.003 --> 00:14:00.048
I'm here
because I've got unrealized potential.

114
00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:02.134
That's according to my old man.

115
00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:05.012
He said. "Don't come home
until you start realizing it."

116
00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:11.351
Let's go challenge C-dorm
to a game. huh? What do you say?

117
00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:17.858
Guess I'll just hit the chow hall.

118
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:19.902
Alone.

119
00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:25.324
Now you're talking.

120
00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:34.541
You probably just left them
in the locker room.

121
00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:37.586
No. Somebody stole them.

122
00:14:38.295 --> 00:14:39.838
You gotta calm down. man.

123
00:14:39.922 --> 00:14:44.885
Look. why don't we just report it
to the office right after we eat. okay?

124
00:14:48.347 --> 00:14:50.682
You got me to thank for those brownies.

125
00:14:50.766 --> 00:14:53.310
Why is that? I don't see no apron on you.

126
00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:56.939
Yeah. well. they realized
I'm a whiz with numbers.

127
00:14:57.022 --> 00:15:00.150
So they got me checking
over the order for the whole cafeteria.

128
00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:01.610
Well. I spotted something.

129
00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:05.113
A unit of brownies costs less
than a unit of beans.

130
00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:06.823
So what?

131
00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:10.160
"So what?" So I switched a few numbers
on the weekly ordering sheet.

132
00:15:10.244 --> 00:15:13.705
And under my new cost-cutting plans.
we got a whole lot more brownies.

133
00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:17.376
And a whole lot of less gas.

134
00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:26.426
What?

135
00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:56.915
What are you doing?

136
00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:04.214
Open up!

137
00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:05.883
Open up!

138
00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:13.807
-Take my shoes? You take my shoes?
-No! Please. no!

139
00:16:13.891 --> 00:16:16.268
Give me them! You gonna steal my shoes?

140
00:16:16.894 --> 00:16:18.270
-My mama gave me them shoes!
-No!

141
00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:20.564
What do you think you're doing. corpsman?

142
00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:23.483
-Don't drop me!
-Let go of him! Stop it. stop it!

143
00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:25.611
Go on out of here. Get out of here.

144
00:16:32.201 --> 00:16:33.493
Where you think you're going?

145
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.998
Is that your artwork?

146
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.171
Let's walk and talk.

147
00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:53.096
Mr. Broadus.

148
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.557
That was federal property
you destroyed back there.

149
00:16:55.641 --> 00:16:57.017
I only got two choices.

150
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.436
Either I send you to prison.
or I send you home.

151
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.146
That boy stole my shoes.

152
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.941
My mama worked hard to give me those.

153
00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.527
-Where's all that rage coming from?
-I don't have any rage.

154
00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:08.987
Get in the car.

155
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:16.787
In the time you've been here.

156
00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.039
you punched out three corpsmen...

157
00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.541
and one innocent door.

158
00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:22.917
They disrespected me.

159
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.127
The door too?

160
00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.052
You got money for a bus ticket?

161
00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:36.890
No.

162
00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:42.145
Here you go.

163
00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.667
I can't go home. Mr. Broadus.

164
00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:10.507
I can't.

165
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:13.385
This place...

166
00:18:15.304 --> 00:18:16.555
it's all I have.

167
00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:21.977
Please?

168
00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.138
You ever box?

169
00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:03.810
Just street fights.

170
00:19:03.894 --> 00:19:06.605
I'm talking about boxing. not fighting.

171
00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:08.357
It's a sport.

172
00:19:09.233 --> 00:19:10.442
With rules.

173
00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.530
I heard it on the radio.

174
00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:18.659
I teach it.

175
00:19:22.204 --> 00:19:23.664
You're big enough and ugly enough.

176
00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:26.208
You wanna learn it?

177
00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:29.920
Yes. sir.

178
00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:33.590
Don't make me regret this.

179
00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:43.767
George. this is Royce.

180
00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:45.853
He's gonna be your opponent today.

181
00:19:46.562 --> 00:19:49.022
Don't worry. big man. I'll be gentle.

182
00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:52.985
That's just a sign
of sportsmanship before you fight.

183
00:19:53.569 --> 00:19:55.571
To show that you're not here
to kill each other.

184
00:19:55.654 --> 00:19:57.281
You're just two athletes

185
00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.491
trying to find out
who's best at the sport.

186
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:01.743
So to do that...

187
00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:05.914
boxers touch gloves. like this:

188
00:20:05.998 --> 00:20:07.916
All right? Let's go.

189
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.002
Let's get on up there.
Let me see what you got.

190
00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:32.441
-All right. Royce. show him what's what.
-When I say "time." you come out fighting.

191
00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:40.199
Anyone want action? Want action. huh?

192
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.534
Leroy Jackson. huh?

193
00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.371
Time!

194
00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.085
Get him. Royce! Get him!

195
00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.343
Be still!

196
00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:13.315
Hit him. George.

197
00:21:16.068 --> 00:21:17.110
Move your feet. George.

198
00:21:17.194 --> 00:21:20.614
You keep standing there like a statue
and a pigeon is gonna crap on you.

199
00:21:27.913 --> 00:21:28.747
Get up.

200
00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:33.877
Get out of that ring. Get out that ring.
Ain't no reason to be in that ring.

201
00:21:36.797 --> 00:21:38.090
Attaboy. Royce!

202
00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:52.479
He was lucky! That's all he was.

203
00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:06.118
Listen. son.
I know that's not what you were--

204
00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:07.661
I'm not your son.

205
00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:08.996
That's a good thing too.

206
00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:11.206
I wouldn't want
no son of mine calling it luck.

207
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.916
when he got whupped fair and square.

208
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.711
They all laughing at me because of you.

209
00:22:15.794 --> 00:22:17.838
What do you care about what they think?

210
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:20.299
Six months ago.
Royce didn't know any more than you do.

211
00:22:21.133 --> 00:22:22.134
I taught him.

212
00:22:23.552 --> 00:22:24.761
I can teach you too.

213
00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:32.311
You got a punch. I'll tell you that.

214
00:22:32.394 --> 00:22:33.896
But that's just about all you got.

215
00:22:35.856 --> 00:22:36.690
There you go.

216
00:22:39.902 --> 00:22:41.486
We gotta get you a jab.

217
00:22:47.659 --> 00:22:49.286
We gotta get you some footwork.

218
00:22:50.287 --> 00:22:52.039
We're gonna start out with a punch.

219
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:55.209
All right? Throw a punch.

220
00:22:59.254 --> 00:23:01.089
Now throw the other one.

221
00:23:10.807 --> 00:23:12.601
See what I just did there?

222
00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:15.896
The mind controls the body.
not the other way around.

223
00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:20.192
In every battle.
the greatest foe that we will combat...

224
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.237
is in here.

225
00:23:24.488 --> 00:23:27.324
You were making fun of Royce
when he was dancing around. wasn't you?

226
00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:29.326
-He was showing off.
-No. he wasn't.

227
00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:32.329
He was trying to force you to go
where he needed you to go.

228
00:23:32.412 --> 00:23:34.873
so he could deliver that punch
that he was setting up.

229
00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:40.045
And he was studying the ring too.
the soft spots. the loose boards.

230
00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:44.132
Not just about punching. George.
It's about thinking.

231
00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:48.679
All right.
Step forward with that left foot.

232
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.765
Now slide that right foot.

233
00:23:52.808 --> 00:23:54.935
Not straight ahead. off to the side.

234
00:23:55.894 --> 00:23:56.728
Put it back.

235
00:23:58.522 --> 00:24:01.275
Here we go. Step forward.

236
00:24:02.568 --> 00:24:03.402
Step back.

237
00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:06.071
Step left.

238
00:24:06.989 --> 00:24:08.198
Step right.

239
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.451
Cut me off. I'm cutting you off.

240
00:24:12.786 --> 00:24:13.787
Cut me off. cut me off.

241
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.039
Good.

242
00:24:42.274 --> 00:24:43.275
Come on.

243
00:24:44.026 --> 00:24:45.944
Come on. Come on.

244
00:24:53.785 --> 00:24:55.954
-Oh. I've seen a woman.
-A woman?

245
00:24:56.038 --> 00:24:58.665
George! Mary. get your brothers in here.

246
00:24:58.749 --> 00:25:00.959
Sonny. Roy. George is on the phone.

247
00:25:01.043 --> 00:25:03.712
-Is that my brother?
-No. no. That's our brother. boy.

248
00:25:04.296 --> 00:25:05.881
Yes. everybody's here.

249
00:25:06.423 --> 00:25:07.591
-Hey. George.
-Hey there.

250
00:25:07.674 --> 00:25:09.426
-We miss you.
-Hi.

251
00:25:12.221 --> 00:25:15.098
-Well. how are you?
-Setting the world on fire.

252
00:25:15.182 --> 00:25:17.142
They raised me 25 cents an hour at work.

253
00:25:17.226 --> 00:25:19.186
Oh. far out.

254
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:20.938
Out? Out where?

255
00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:24.107
Oh. no. That's just something
they say out here in California.

256
00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:26.026
You can't come back to Texas
talking like that.

257
00:25:31.114 --> 00:25:33.909
-I'm going to the gym a lot.
-Basketball?

258
00:25:33.992 --> 00:25:37.162
<i>No. no. I found something better.</i>

259
00:25:37.246 --> 00:25:39.164
I'm learning how to box.

260
00:25:39.248 --> 00:25:41.416
Please don't tell me
you're fighting again.

261
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.253
-No. I'm not fighting.
-Then what do you call it. George?

262
00:25:44.336 --> 00:25:47.214
It's boxing. It's a sport with rules.

263
00:25:47.297 --> 00:25:48.507
And I'm good at it.

264
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.801
God knows I don't want you to be fighting.

265
00:25:50.884 --> 00:25:53.345
God? What's God got to do
with anything. Mama?

266
00:25:53.428 --> 00:25:55.264
Don't tell me you gone so far from home.

267
00:25:55.347 --> 00:25:57.432
you don't know
what God's gotta do with your life.

268
00:25:57.516 --> 00:26:00.185
-Mama. I'm just trying-- Mama?
<i>-Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

269
00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:01.144
Mama?

270
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.647
-George?
<i>-Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

271
00:26:04.523 --> 00:26:07.860
<i>Please deposit 10 cents
for the next minute.</i>

272
00:26:08.902 --> 00:26:11.071
<i>Please deposit 10 cents.</i>

273
00:26:19.746 --> 00:26:21.915
Come on. Royce. put him down.

274
00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:24.334
All right. George. You got this.

275
00:26:24.418 --> 00:26:25.294
Time!

276
00:26:28.922 --> 00:26:31.675
Come on. cut him off! Cut him off!

277
00:26:46.106 --> 00:26:47.357
Oh. yeah!

278
00:26:49.818 --> 00:26:51.320
That's my bunkmate.

279
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.665
I may be a little late tonight.

280
00:27:03.749 --> 00:27:04.958
I know I promised.

281
00:27:05.792 --> 00:27:06.793
I will try.

282
00:27:12.382 --> 00:27:14.927
My wife thinks
I give up too much time to this place.

283
00:27:16.136 --> 00:27:18.555
-You boxed?
-I went professional.

284
00:27:19.181 --> 00:27:21.350
Won my first 24 fights.

285
00:27:22.184 --> 00:27:23.185
And then what?

286
00:27:23.268 --> 00:27:26.730
Unfortunately.
I had to trade one uniform for another.

287
00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:31.068
Hey. I see you're reading the <i>Boxing News.</i>

288
00:27:31.151 --> 00:27:33.278
-Yeah.
-You an aficionado now?

289
00:27:33.362 --> 00:27:35.489
-I was looking at Joe Frazier.
-Yeah?

290
00:27:35.572 --> 00:27:36.990
He's real good.

291
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.744
Yeah. I wouldn't mind all this
that he's got.

292
00:27:45.582 --> 00:27:47.709
I wanna be
the heavyweight champion of the world.

293
00:27:50.254 --> 00:27:52.297
Slow down. George. Slow down.

294
00:27:52.381 --> 00:27:54.591
I can't slow down. I gotta speed up.

295
00:27:54.675 --> 00:27:57.970
-You said you can get me some fights.
-I can. and I will.

296
00:27:58.053 --> 00:27:58.971
Okay.

297
00:27:59.513 --> 00:28:02.057
But first. you gotta win some tournaments.

298
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.143
Then we can take aim at the Golden Gloves.

299
00:28:05.227 --> 00:28:08.438
And after that.
we can set our sights on the Olympics.

300
00:28:08.522 --> 00:28:09.731
Well. when are they?

301
00:28:10.566 --> 00:28:12.484
Next summer. Mexico City.

302
00:28:12.568 --> 00:28:15.445
But we're gonna wait
for the one after that.

303
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:18.574
That gives you five years
to train and develop.

304
00:28:18.657 --> 00:28:20.242
Five years?

305
00:28:20.325 --> 00:28:21.952
I'll be a old man.

306
00:28:22.035 --> 00:28:23.287
Listen to me. George.

307
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.831
You got a punch like I've never seen.

308
00:28:25.914 --> 00:28:29.334
But even if you trained harder
than any man has ever trained.

309
00:28:29.418 --> 00:28:33.380
there is no way that you can make it
to the Olympics next year.

310
00:28:39.386 --> 00:28:43.098
<i>The Russians are dominating here
at the Olympics in Mexico City.</i>

311
00:28:43.182 --> 00:28:45.559
<i>three gold medals
to just one for the U.S. team.</i>

312
00:28:46.894 --> 00:28:49.229
<i>The Russians have saved
their best for last.</i>

313
00:28:49.313 --> 00:28:52.691
<i>The legendary Jonas Čepulis
has won 203 fights.</i>

314
00:28:53.317 --> 00:28:54.318
Come on. George.

315
00:28:56.361 --> 00:28:59.072
<i>America's final hope.
19-year-old George Foreman.</i>

316
00:28:59.156 --> 00:29:01.366
<i>has been fighting for only one year.</i>

317
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:04.995
<i>He would seem to have no chance
at winning gold.</i>

318
00:29:05.078 --> 00:29:06.371
Come on.

319
00:29:06.997 --> 00:29:10.584
<i>I don't think anyone has ever seen
a bigger mismatch in the Olympic ring.</i>

320
00:29:11.084 --> 00:29:14.338
<i>What Foreman's being asked
to do today is impossible.</i>

321
00:29:15.589 --> 00:29:19.384
<i>The big Russian's setting the tone early.
giving the young rookie a boxing lesson.</i>

322
00:29:19.468 --> 00:29:21.053
Come on. wake up.

323
00:29:23.013 --> 00:29:24.348
Hit him now. Get him now.

324
00:29:27.267 --> 00:29:28.393
Wake up.

325
00:29:34.733 --> 00:29:36.318
<i>Big left hand from George Foreman.</i>

326
00:29:36.944 --> 00:29:37.778
You see that?

327
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.406
Yeah!

328
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:42.783
Yeah! Yes!

329
00:29:42.866 --> 00:29:46.078
<i>The Fighting Corpsman is turning
the tables on Čepulis.</i>

330
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.123
<i>Foreman pouring it on now. landing bombs.</i>

331
00:29:50.207 --> 00:29:52.668
<i>Čepulis looks like
he's in really bad shape.</i>

332
00:30:00.884 --> 00:30:03.762
-Stop. stop! That's it!
<i>-The ref has stopped the fight!</i>

333

<i>Nineteen-year-old George Foreman has

334
00:30:11.645 --> 00:30:12.688
Yeah!

00:30:12.771 --> 00:30:15.107
-He won the gold medal.
-Look at him.

336
00:30:18.193 --> 00:30:19.319
God help him.

337
00:30:28.537 --> 00:30:33.166

<i>Foreman! Foreman! Foreman!</i>

340
00:31:07.034 --> 00:31:09.369
-Hey. George.
-Hey. what's going on. brother?

341
00:31:13.624 --> 00:31:14.458
Hey. Tuck.

342
00:31:16.168 --> 00:31:19.254
-Hey. brother. What's going on?
-What's up. George?

343
00:31:19.338 --> 00:31:20.172
Hey.

344
00:31:23.008 --> 00:31:24.885
You can go ahead and touch it. man.

345
00:31:24.968 --> 00:31:26.220
It's heavy though.

346
00:31:27.012 --> 00:31:29.431
Yeah. I bet it's heavy. all right.

347
00:31:31.058 --> 00:31:32.684
What's that 'posed to mean?

348
00:31:33.435 --> 00:31:38.524
Man. I don't see how you can hold
that American flag all up high like you do

349
00:31:39.024 --> 00:31:41.693
when our brothers. shoot. our brothers.

350
00:31:42.402 --> 00:31:45.405
they was doing their thing over there.

351
00:31:51.703 --> 00:31:54.206
They was standing up for all us back here.

352
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:55.749
And what were you doing?

353
00:31:55.832 --> 00:31:58.585
Standing up for a country
that don't love you back.

354
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:00.754
That's heavy.

355
00:32:15.394 --> 00:32:16.979
You gotta let this go.

356
00:32:17.062 --> 00:32:20.190
If anybody ever talk to me
about that flag again.

357
00:32:20.274 --> 00:32:22.192
they not gonna get away with it.

358
00:32:22.276 --> 00:32:24.111
They acting like I'm some kind of sellout.

359
00:32:25.529 --> 00:32:27.823
Let me make you something to eat.
Anything you want.

360
00:32:27.906 --> 00:32:28.907
I'm not hungry.

361
00:32:29.992 --> 00:32:33.954
Let the Lord take me now.
I never thought I'd hear that from you.

362
00:32:47.301 --> 00:32:49.928
You left here with nothing to your name.

363
00:32:50.012 --> 00:32:51.972
and you came back with gold.

364
00:32:52.598 --> 00:32:55.184
Then how come
all anybody wanna talk about is the flag?

365
00:32:56.977 --> 00:32:58.437
You know what I'm gonna do?

366
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.148
I'm gonna win the championship belt.

367
00:33:01.231 --> 00:33:04.318
-And they'll respect me then.
-You gonna keep fighting?

368
00:33:05.652 --> 00:33:06.904
You gonna get hurt.

369
00:33:06.987 --> 00:33:09.698
Didn't you watch me? They don't hurt me.

370
00:33:10.407 --> 00:33:11.533
I hurt them.

371
00:33:11.617 --> 00:33:15.120
And that's all you wanna do
with your life. hurt people?

372
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:19.458
You are better than this.

373
00:33:19.541 --> 00:33:20.792
I got a plan. Mama.

374
00:33:21.752 --> 00:33:23.670
And I need you to believe in it.

375
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.172
I heard he's not so bad.

376
00:34:11.342 --> 00:34:12.344
Right on.

377
00:34:13.428 --> 00:34:14.471
And you are?

378
00:34:15.347 --> 00:34:18.725
-Paula.
<i>-Last call for Flight 275 to Los Angeles.</i>

379
00:34:18.809 --> 00:34:21.228
That's me. Nice meeting you. George.

380
00:34:21.311 --> 00:34:23.230
Wait. Oh. that's not fair.

381
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:27.025
-You live here in Oakland?
-Yes. I do.

382
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:29.027
So that means you'll be coming back.

383
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.821
Yeah. I'm moving here.

384
00:34:30.904 --> 00:34:33.949
I'm gonna be training.
but when I'm not. you know.

385
00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:36.243
I could go outside sometimes.

386
00:34:36.326 --> 00:34:38.829
Your footwork is better
than your pickup game. George.

387
00:34:39.788 --> 00:34:41.581
Yeah. I can't argue that.

388
00:34:41.665 --> 00:34:44.877
Tell me something about yourself.
Anything.

389
00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:47.670
-Anything?
-Yeah.

390
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.719
I can type a hundred words a minute.

391
00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.097
I can't even talk that fast.

392
00:35:04.271 --> 00:35:05.689
Can I see you again?

393
00:35:11.195 --> 00:35:13.238
Go ahead and write your phone number down.

394
00:35:15.699 --> 00:35:18.202
I'm the one 'posed to be asking for yours.

395
00:35:18.285 --> 00:35:21.330
George. do I look like the kind of woman
that stands around by the phone?

396
00:35:38.055 --> 00:35:40.516
No. ma'am. You do not.

397
00:35:40.599 --> 00:35:43.560
Well. hold on.
Are you sure we need these guys?

398
00:35:43.644 --> 00:35:45.395
Pro game's a racket.

399
00:35:45.479 --> 00:35:47.356
These guys could take us
where we need to go.

400
00:35:52.569 --> 00:35:57.616
<i>I'm smelling me some new blood. new blood</i>

401
00:35:59.368 --> 00:36:01.537
Hey. Dick Sadler.

402
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.664
He gonna be your trainer
and your promoter.

403
00:36:04.581 --> 00:36:05.999
This is Archie Moore.

404
00:36:06.083 --> 00:36:08.669
the former light-heavyweight champion
of the world.

405
00:36:08.752 --> 00:36:10.754
He gonna teach you everything
that he done learned.

406
00:36:10.838 --> 00:36:12.965
If I like what I see.

407
00:36:17.928 --> 00:36:19.513
Hey. Sonny. I'm such a big fan.

408
00:36:20.722 --> 00:36:21.890
Can I get your autograph?

409
00:36:23.183 --> 00:36:24.726
-Hey. that's--
-Yeah. it's--

410
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:25.978
Sonny Liston.

411
00:36:26.478 --> 00:36:28.647
We make champions around here. son.

412
00:36:29.439 --> 00:36:32.776
What you're setting out to do
is beyond your imagination.

413
00:36:34.778 --> 00:36:37.281
The morning you wake up
to fight for that championship.

414
00:36:37.364 --> 00:36:40.576
the air taste different.
the sun look different.

415
00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:44.246
Only two men on this whole earth matter
and you're one of them.

416
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:47.624
The other. if you make it that far.

417
00:36:47.708 --> 00:36:49.084
is Joe Frazier.

418
00:37:08.145 --> 00:37:11.315
We gonna name this bag Joe Frazier.

419
00:37:12.482 --> 00:37:15.652
If you hit him in the solar plexus.
you gonna cut off his breathing.

420
00:37:15.736 --> 00:37:18.655
You hit him in the chin.
you gonna rattle his nerves.

421
00:37:18.739 --> 00:37:21.408
You hit him in the heart.
you gonna make his heartbeat skip.

422
00:37:21.491 --> 00:37:23.410
Every punch. George. power!

423
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.164
<i>-Hello?
</i>-First ring.

424
00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:29.708
-Paula!
-Yes.

425
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:32.085
I wanna hear the rest of that story
you were starting to tell me.

426
00:37:32.794 --> 00:37:34.004
What story?

427
00:37:34.087 --> 00:37:37.007
About how you can type 100 words a minute.

428
00:37:39.718 --> 00:37:41.011
That story.

429
00:37:41.094 --> 00:37:45.224
George. when are you gonna
ask me a real question?

430
00:37:45.307 --> 00:37:46.350
Like what?

431
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.227
Like...

432
00:37:49.019 --> 00:37:50.687
if I wanna go out on a date.

433
00:37:53.649 --> 00:37:55.067
Pound him. George. Pound him!

434
00:38:03.784 --> 00:38:05.869
You sure you typing real words?

435
00:38:05.953 --> 00:38:07.871
Yeah. that sound like music.

436
00:38:24.137 --> 00:38:26.473
-Knock him out. baby!
-All right. all right.

437
00:38:26.557 --> 00:38:28.016
Keep him there. Keep him there.

438
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:30.143
Move him. man.

439
00:38:34.523 --> 00:38:36.358
-That's it!
-Yes!

440
00:38:41.864 --> 00:38:44.116
The winner by TKO.

441
00:38:44.199 --> 00:38:47.911
still undefeated. George Foreman!

442
00:38:50.914 --> 00:38:53.208
Do you take this woman to be your wife?

443
00:38:53.292 --> 00:38:54.293
You bet I do.

444
00:39:00.215 --> 00:39:01.592
You may kiss the bride.

445
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.059
Hey. watch this.

446
00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:28.368
-I think you ready.
-Nice punching. big fella.

447
00:39:30.662 --> 00:39:32.623
Frazier won't know what hit him.

448
00:39:33.874 --> 00:39:37.586
<i>Here we are
for the heavyweight championship fight</i>

449
00:39:37.669 --> 00:39:41.423
<i>between Joe Frazier and George Foreman.</i>

450
00:39:42.758 --> 00:39:45.719
<i>Joe Frazier is the heavy favorite tonight.</i>

451
00:39:45.802 --> 00:39:49.556
His best weapon. the left hook. is deadly.

452
00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.893
Put Ali on the canvas two years ago.

453
00:39:52.976 --> 00:39:57.189
and if Foreman isn't aware of it.
it could put him on his back.

454
00:39:57.272 --> 00:40:01.151
and maybe even carried
out of the arena on a stretcher.

455
00:40:01.235 --> 00:40:04.446
<i>Frazier! Frazier! Frazier!</i>

456
00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:07.533
<i>Frazier! Frazier! Frazier!</i>

457
00:40:07.616 --> 00:40:10.244
<i>Frazier! Frazier! Frazier!</i>

458
00:40:10.327 --> 00:40:13.121
<i>Frazier! Frazier! Frazier!</i>

459
00:40:13.205 --> 00:40:15.374
<i>Frazier! Frazier! Frazier!</i>

460
00:40:15.457 --> 00:40:18.460
This contest is for
the heavyweight championship of the world.

461
00:40:18.544 --> 00:40:21.129
It's governed
by the Jamaican Board of Control...

462
00:40:21.213 --> 00:40:23.799
Nobody giving you a chance to win tonight.

463
00:40:25.717 --> 00:40:26.802
<i>That's good.</i>

464
00:40:30.889 --> 00:40:33.392
<i>But Smokin' Joe ain't like
the others. nah.</i>

465
00:40:34.393 --> 00:40:36.061
He the real deal.

466
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.524
Remember. only two men
on this whole earth matter.

467
00:40:41.567 --> 00:40:42.693
Now go get him.

468
00:40:45.112 --> 00:40:46.363
<i>You're ready. George.</i>

469
00:40:47.739 --> 00:40:50.617
<i>Now. Joe.
he's expecting that you're just a man.</i>

470
00:40:51.785 --> 00:40:54.663
<i>But tonight. you're a beast.</i>

471
00:40:55.956 --> 00:40:57.165
Let him out.

472
00:40:59.126 --> 00:41:01.086
And there's the bell. They're underway.

473
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.630
Oh. big swing and a miss from George.

474
00:41:07.176 --> 00:41:09.261
There's that Joe Frazier left hook.

475
00:41:09.344 --> 00:41:11.763
One more of those could end it.

476
00:41:11.847 --> 00:41:14.391
Stay on him. Watch out for that.
Watch out for that.

477
00:41:18.687 --> 00:41:20.272
Big shot by Foreman.

478
00:41:25.277 --> 00:41:26.862
Oh. and another left hook!

479
00:41:26.945 --> 00:41:28.739
How is he still standing?

480
00:41:30.449 --> 00:41:31.700
There it is.

481
00:41:33.535 --> 00:41:36.788
Frazier's taking some damage.
A real surprise.

482
00:41:37.456 --> 00:41:38.707
That's it. That's it!

483
00:41:42.085 --> 00:41:45.422
Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!

484
00:41:45.506 --> 00:41:47.132
Down goes Frazier!

485
00:41:51.303 --> 00:41:52.763
Joe is slow to get up.

486
00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.643
And George Foreman is standing
as poised as can be.

487
00:41:57.726 --> 00:42:01.230
The heavyweight champ
is taking the eight count.

488
00:42:02.898 --> 00:42:04.942
There's the bell for the second round.

489
00:42:06.735 --> 00:42:09.238
But Joe is tough. Joe is game.

490
00:42:10.489 --> 00:42:15.452
And Foreman is all over him again.
just hitting him again and again.

491
00:42:20.332 --> 00:42:21.792
He's down again!

492
00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:23.460
This is hard to believe.

493
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.088
Get off the ropes!

494
00:42:26.171 --> 00:42:29.466
Six. seven. eight.

495
00:42:34.012 --> 00:42:36.598
He's target practice for George Foreman.

496
00:42:36.682 --> 00:42:38.725
Target practice!

497
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:42.563
-Don't let up.
-How much more can Frazier take?

498
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:54.449
He's down! He's down again!

499
00:42:54.533 --> 00:42:55.868
And it's over!

500
00:42:55.951 --> 00:42:57.870
It's over! So long!

501
00:42:57.953 --> 00:43:00.205
I've never seen anything like this.

502
00:43:01.415 --> 00:43:06.044
George Foreman is the new
heavyweight champion of the world.

503
00:43:15.387 --> 00:43:17.055
All right.

504
00:43:17.139 --> 00:43:18.265
All right.

505
00:43:19.099 --> 00:43:20.100
Yes.

506
00:43:37.659 --> 00:43:39.077
How does it feel to be a winner?

507
00:43:39.161 --> 00:43:41.330
I was determined
to become a winner tonight.

508
00:43:41.413 --> 00:43:43.415
I'd like to thank the press
all over the country

509
00:43:43.498 --> 00:43:45.292
for writing beautiful things about me.

510
00:43:45.375 --> 00:43:48.295
The press has kept my name
in the paper. And...

511
00:43:49.171 --> 00:43:51.465
And it kept me focused.

512
00:43:51.548 --> 00:43:54.968
So. what's the first thing
you'll do as a champion. George?

513
00:43:55.052 --> 00:43:57.346
I'm gonna buy my mama a big house.

514
00:44:00.182 --> 00:44:03.143
Wait a second. Wait-- What is this?

515
00:44:03.227 --> 00:44:06.146
Is that the champ? Is that the champ?

516
00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:10.275
Do you have any idea
what's coming next. George?

517
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:12.861
A flood of money.

518
00:44:12.945 --> 00:44:15.072
Well. I'm always ready for money.

519
00:44:15.906 --> 00:44:17.241
But my moneyman ain't.

520
00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:22.329
You want me to be your moneyman?

521
00:44:22.412 --> 00:44:23.747
Yeah. I do.

522
00:44:24.873 --> 00:44:26.124
But. Des. man...

523
00:44:27.084 --> 00:44:30.003
I'm gonna need you sharp from now on.

524
00:44:38.262 --> 00:44:40.097
That's what I'm talking about.

525
00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.351
It's a long way from the Job Corps.

526
00:45:15.007 --> 00:45:16.592
How'd you get up here?

527
00:45:24.683 --> 00:45:26.310
You don't want me to stay?

528
00:46:06.099 --> 00:46:09.645
<i>Muhammad. there are a lot of people saying</i>

529
00:46:09.728 --> 00:46:12.397
<i>they've never seen as formidable a puncher</i>

530
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:15.943
<i>as the new champ.
young George Foreman.</i>

531
00:46:16.026 --> 00:46:17.736
<i>Howard. when I think of George Foreman.</i>

532
00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:21.281
<i>I think of the establishment.
the flag-waver.</i>

533
00:46:21.365 --> 00:46:23.116
<i>And I got a new punch for George. Howard.</i>

534
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.410
<i>and I call it the "Ghetto Whopper."</i>

535
00:46:25.494 --> 00:46:27.579
<i>And the reason I call it
the Ghetto Whopper</i>

536
00:46:27.663 --> 00:46:31.667
<i>is because it's thrown in the ghetto
at 3 o'clock in the morning.</i>

537
00:46:32.334 --> 00:46:33.794
<i>You ever seen one of them punches?</i>

538
00:46:33.877 --> 00:46:36.046
<i>Comes out of nowhere.
hits you like a bottle in the head.</i>

539
00:46:36.129 --> 00:46:38.966
<i>Think you'd have to wait
till 3:00 in the morning</i>

540
00:46:39.049 --> 00:46:40.509
<i>to fight George Foreman?</i>

541
00:46:40.592 --> 00:46:42.094
<i>Howard. let it be known.</i>

542
00:46:42.177 --> 00:46:45.514
<i>I will fight George Foreman
anywhere. any time.</i>

543
00:46:49.184 --> 00:46:51.937
-What y'all think? Nice. isn't it?
-Oh. my Lord.

544
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.898
Now. come on.
I wanna show y'all something.

545
00:46:56.316 --> 00:46:57.317
Y'all hear that?

546
00:46:58.068 --> 00:47:00.529
Now. each car has its own personality.

547
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.781
That's why you need five of them?

548
00:47:03.532 --> 00:47:06.618
Five? Wait till you see my garage.

549
00:47:07.202 --> 00:47:09.705
Oh. my Lord.
You've lost your doggone mind.

550
00:47:09.788 --> 00:47:11.373
I wanna show y'all something else.

551
00:47:11.957 --> 00:47:14.168
-All right. You got that other one there?
-Yes. sir.

552
00:47:14.251 --> 00:47:15.085
Okay.

553
00:47:16.295 --> 00:47:17.838
Been on a grill all day for y'all.

554
00:47:17.921 --> 00:47:21.300
My own barbecue sauce.
I took my time on it.

555
00:47:21.383 --> 00:47:24.052
-Okay. That's what I'm talking about.
-Working on this all day.

556
00:47:24.761 --> 00:47:26.388
-Okay
-That looks fantastic.

557
00:47:26.471 --> 00:47:27.848
There she is.

558
00:47:28.932 --> 00:47:31.351
-Give me my birthday baby.
-Your daddy wants you.

559
00:47:32.728 --> 00:47:33.896
-Yeah.
-Go to Daddy.

560
00:47:35.272 --> 00:47:36.273
Yeah.

561
00:47:37.649 --> 00:47:40.277
-Happy birthday.
-How about one for your wife too?

562
00:47:43.655 --> 00:47:46.450
All right. Say hi to everybody.

563
00:47:46.533 --> 00:47:47.951
Say hi to everybody.

564
00:47:48.035 --> 00:47:50.329
-Happy birthday. beautiful.
-I'm gonna give you away.

565
00:47:50.412 --> 00:47:51.622
-Don't give her away.
-I love you.

566
00:47:53.999 --> 00:47:55.417
-All right.
-Bye.

567
00:47:56.627 --> 00:47:58.670
-It's time to eat now.
-Boy.

568
00:47:58.754 --> 00:48:01.924
-You know better.
-Let's thank God for the food first.

569
00:48:02.007 --> 00:48:03.008
God?

570
00:48:04.051 --> 00:48:05.802
I bought the food. Mama.

571
00:48:05.886 --> 00:48:08.180
-Not God.
-Good.

572
00:48:08.805 --> 00:48:10.057
Then you say grace.

573
00:48:13.185 --> 00:48:14.770
I like the way you say it. Mama.

574
00:48:16.688 --> 00:48:19.233
Me and Charles have something
we wanna tell y'all.

575
00:48:21.485 --> 00:48:23.529
-We're having a baby.
-A baby?

576
00:48:24.196 --> 00:48:27.032
Charles. you old dog.
Getting my sister pregnant.

577
00:48:27.115 --> 00:48:29.743
-Look at that.
-Mary. congratulations.

578
00:48:29.826 --> 00:48:31.453
-Thank you.
-It's great.

579
00:48:33.455 --> 00:48:35.666
We'll have me another niece
or nephew running around here.

580
00:48:38.794 --> 00:48:39.628
Hello?

581
00:48:43.507 --> 00:48:45.217
Stop calling this house.

582
00:48:49.388 --> 00:48:51.557
-So. Des...
-Yes. sir.

583
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:52.975
How's my money doing?

584
00:48:53.058 --> 00:48:57.229
I'm pouring everything
into rock-solid stocks.

585
00:48:57.312 --> 00:48:58.897
I like the sound of that.

586
00:48:58.981 --> 00:49:00.732
"Rock-solid stocks."

587
00:49:03.402 --> 00:49:06.989
You know. Ali sure been talking
a whole bunch of mess on TV.

588
00:49:07.072 --> 00:49:09.157
bragging about which round
he'll knock you out in.

589
00:49:11.743 --> 00:49:13.203
Talk is cheap.

590
00:49:13.287 --> 00:49:16.623
You know what they say about pretty boys
back in the Fifth Wards.

591
00:49:16.707 --> 00:49:18.333
They can't take a punch.

592
00:49:18.417 --> 00:49:19.418
Yes.

593
00:49:31.513 --> 00:49:33.765
I think everybody's ready for dessert.

594
00:49:33.849 --> 00:49:35.267
You should tell me their names.

595
00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.270
so I don't have to stand there
holding the phone like a fool.

596
00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:40.564
What are you talking about?

597
00:49:40.647 --> 00:49:42.024
Did you think I didn't know?

598
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:47.487
-I don't have time for this.
-No. it's me you don't have time for.

599
00:49:52.743 --> 00:49:57.122
How many have there been. George?

600
00:50:01.627 --> 00:50:03.837
You can't even look me in the eye anymore.

601
00:50:03.921 --> 00:50:07.216
Woman. I got a $5 million fight
coming up against Ali.

602
00:50:07.299 --> 00:50:10.594
You think I dropped my life for you.
so that I could play seconds?

603
00:50:12.179 --> 00:50:14.181
I was doing just fine
before you came along.

604
00:50:14.264 --> 00:50:16.475
So you don't like this life now. huh?

605
00:50:17.559 --> 00:50:18.894
I give you everything.

606
00:50:18.977 --> 00:50:20.687
I don't want everything.

607
00:50:26.401 --> 00:50:27.569
I want you.

608
00:50:29.404 --> 00:50:30.489
You have me.

609
00:50:33.408 --> 00:50:34.493
Look at me.

610
00:50:45.629 --> 00:50:46.797
Look at me.

611
00:50:59.434 --> 00:51:00.727
Just like I thought.

612
00:51:43.812 --> 00:51:45.230
Sir. No. no.

613
00:51:45.814 --> 00:51:46.940
-I got it.
-Okay.

614
00:51:56.366 --> 00:51:57.451
Come on. now.

615
00:51:57.534 --> 00:51:59.912
We gonna float like a butterfly.
sting like a bee.

616
00:51:59.995 --> 00:52:02.706
His hands can't hit
what his eyes can't see.

617
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:04.291
Now you see me. Now you don't.

618
00:52:04.374 --> 00:52:06.502
George thinks he will.
but I know he won't.

619
00:52:07.377 --> 00:52:08.921
Ain't that right. Bundini?

620
00:52:09.004 --> 00:52:12.174
Him hitting Joe Frazier
with these big. long punches.

621
00:52:12.257 --> 00:52:13.842
Boxes like a mummy.

622
00:52:14.927 --> 00:52:18.680
"Come here. Where'd you get?
Oh. you over here."

623
00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:22.059
All of you sportswriters.
all of you suckers.

624
00:52:22.142 --> 00:52:24.520
are gonna regret
making me the underdog.

625
00:52:24.603 --> 00:52:26.104
How you gonna make me the underdog?

626
00:52:26.188 --> 00:52:28.482
Talking about George Foreman
is the new champ.

627
00:52:28.565 --> 00:52:31.693
George Foreman ain't no new champ.
He is the new chump.

628
00:52:32.486 --> 00:52:35.405
And he's holding the belt
that was wrongfully taken from me.

629
00:52:35.489 --> 00:52:37.699
And he can't box. He moves like this.

630
00:52:37.783 --> 00:52:39.785
This how he box. Box like a mummy.

631
00:52:40.702 --> 00:52:42.371
"Coming here for you. I'm--"

632
00:52:44.998 --> 00:52:45.999
George.

633
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:48.919
We was just talking
about a different fighter.

634
00:52:52.673 --> 00:52:54.633
Your turn. Big George.

635
00:52:54.716 --> 00:52:56.677
Why don't you give us
your side of things. huh?

636
00:53:19.032 --> 00:53:23.161
Well. if he boxes how he does interviews.
this gonna be a short night.

637
00:53:24.162 --> 00:53:25.539
Real short night.

638
00:53:25.622 --> 00:53:28.625
We gonna get it on
because we don't get along.

639
00:53:29.418 --> 00:53:31.295
I feel sorry for Ali.

640
00:53:32.087 --> 00:53:33.797
Foreman could put him in the morgue.

641
00:53:48.979 --> 00:53:50.314
"Ali. kill him."

642
00:53:51.607 --> 00:53:53.192
That's what they want?

643
00:53:59.489 --> 00:54:00.490
Foreman...

644
00:54:23.305 --> 00:54:24.681
Rush him like a tiger.

645
00:54:24.765 --> 00:54:26.058
Shut him up for good.

646
00:54:26.141 --> 00:54:28.560
Ali has shocked the world before.

647
00:54:28.644 --> 00:54:32.564
but most of us don't expect him
to get past the middle rounds.

648
00:54:32.648 --> 00:54:35.984
Well. Frank.
Ali is certainly the big underdog.

649
00:54:36.068 --> 00:54:40.113
But he and the country have adopted
the phrase. "Ali. <i>bomaye."</i>

650
00:54:40.197 --> 00:54:41.323
"Ali. kill him."

651
00:54:41.406 --> 00:54:42.824
At 32 years of age.

652
00:54:42.908 --> 00:54:45.827
can Muhammad Ali dance
and stay away from Foreman?

653
00:54:45.911 --> 00:54:47.996
After what Foreman did to Frazier.

654
00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.958
Ali would seem to have no chance.

655
00:54:52.459 --> 00:54:54.545
All questions will be answered.

656
00:54:54.628 --> 00:54:57.089
Come on. baby. Come on. George.

657
00:54:57.172 --> 00:54:58.882
-You got this. George.
-Dance with him.

658
00:55:02.511 --> 00:55:04.930
-Get in there.
-Rush him. George. Rush him.

659
00:55:05.013 --> 00:55:06.515
-Right hook.
-Rush him.

660
00:55:09.852 --> 00:55:10.978
There you go.

661
00:55:11.645 --> 00:55:12.980
Punch him in the head.

662
00:55:13.063 --> 00:55:14.648
Let him go. Break. Break.

663
00:55:17.484 --> 00:55:19.027
Come on. George. Come on.

664
00:55:20.487 --> 00:55:21.905
Hands up. Yeah!

665
00:55:27.536 --> 00:55:29.663
That's all you got. George? Come on.

666
00:55:35.878 --> 00:55:37.004
Keep pounding.

667
00:55:37.087 --> 00:55:38.255
He can't last.

668
00:55:39.298 --> 00:55:40.424
Keep on pounding.

669
00:55:46.972 --> 00:55:48.390
That's right. champ.

670
00:55:51.602 --> 00:55:53.645
Ali retreating to the ropes.

671
00:55:53.729 --> 00:55:56.106
looking for a place to hide
from Foreman's power.

672
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:57.065
That's all you got?

673
00:55:57.149 --> 00:56:00.152
I don't see any place to hide
in that ring.

674
00:56:00.903 --> 00:56:02.738
Ali. get off of those ropes!

675
00:56:04.031 --> 00:56:05.824
Foreman's pouring on the punches.

676
00:56:07.034 --> 00:56:09.244
Those punches gotta be doing some damage.

677
00:56:09.328 --> 00:56:11.663
They told me you was bad. George.
Let me see it.

678
00:56:11.747 --> 00:56:15.209
Ali cannot keep taking them
and expect to survive.

679
00:56:15.667 --> 00:56:16.835
Box.

680
00:56:22.007 --> 00:56:23.300
Come on. Show me something.

681
00:56:23.383 --> 00:56:24.760
Don't play with that sucker.

682
00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:28.639
Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

683
00:56:29.973 --> 00:56:31.600
Stay on him. George!

684
00:56:32.601 --> 00:56:34.978
Come on. champ. get off the ropes.
Come on. now.

685
00:56:36.063 --> 00:56:37.189
There it is.

686
00:56:39.775 --> 00:56:40.901
Break it up. ref.

687
00:56:41.652 --> 00:56:44.154
-What's my name?
-There we go. Break it up.

688
00:56:49.618 --> 00:56:52.371
Get off those ropes! Get out of there!

689
00:56:53.288 --> 00:56:55.874
I'm not sure about this strategy
of retreating to the ropes.

690
00:56:55.958 --> 00:56:58.669
I'm going right back to the ropes.
Come and get me.

691
00:56:58.752 --> 00:57:00.879
Come on. Put that pressure on him. George.

692
00:57:00.963 --> 00:57:01.922
He's getting pounded.

693
00:57:02.005 --> 00:57:04.967
Those blows are deadly
from George Foreman.

694
00:57:10.389 --> 00:57:12.641
Come on. George. Let me see something.

695
00:57:18.146 --> 00:57:19.857
Get off of those ropes!

696
00:57:23.026 --> 00:57:25.904
Come on. George.
They told me you could hit hard.

697
00:57:26.446 --> 00:57:27.489
There you go.

698
00:57:37.875 --> 00:57:39.126
That's all you got?

699
00:57:45.674 --> 00:57:49.386
Big right hand from Ali.
That punch staggered Foreman.

700
00:57:49.469 --> 00:57:51.138
They told me you was bad. George.

701
00:57:51.221 --> 00:57:52.848
They told me you was bad.

702
00:57:52.931 --> 00:57:56.935
That one punch definitely changed
the tenor of this fight.

703
00:58:04.193 --> 00:58:07.529
Keep hitting him. Keep pounding him.

704
00:58:22.711 --> 00:58:24.004
I'm gonna end it.

705
00:58:27.758 --> 00:58:28.800
I'm gonna end it.

706
00:58:35.682 --> 00:58:37.643
Get off those ropes. champ. Come on.

707
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.561
That's right.

708
00:59:09.132 --> 00:59:11.426
Foreman's punches just don't have
any juice on them.

709
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:13.387
Foreman looks tired.

710
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:14.680
He could be in real trouble.

711
00:59:14.763 --> 00:59:17.808
Maybe this is
what Ali was counting on. Frank.

712
00:59:20.394 --> 00:59:22.437
-Work on him. George!
-Destroy him!

713
00:59:34.241 --> 00:59:35.409
My turn.

714
00:59:35.492 --> 00:59:37.744
Come on. That's right.
Left. right. left. Come on.

715
00:59:38.745 --> 00:59:42.499
Oh. Muhammad Ali
with a massive right hand!

716
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.003
And another one!

717
01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:08.775
...four. five. six. seven.

718
01:00:08.859 --> 01:00:11.820
eight. nine. ten.

719
01:00:11.904 --> 01:00:14.406
And it's over. It's over!

720
01:00:14.489 --> 01:00:16.700
Ali has done the impossible.

721
01:00:16.783 --> 01:00:19.620
Ali did it! Ali did it again.

722
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:31.381
<i>I lived one way my whole life.</i>

723
01:00:33.926 --> 01:00:34.927
<i>To hurt...</i>

724
01:00:36.303 --> 01:00:37.596
<i>to knock down...</i>

725
01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:39.973
<i>to destroy.</i>

726
01:00:53.278 --> 01:00:55.447
<i>It became all I could see.</i>

727
01:00:58.617 --> 01:01:00.702
<i>I was blind to everything else.</i>

728
01:01:03.622 --> 01:01:05.707
<i>When will I get to see you. Daddy?</i>

729
01:01:07.584 --> 01:01:08.418
Soon.

730
01:01:10.629 --> 01:01:11.630
I promise.

731
01:01:13.799 --> 01:01:17.177
And we will never be apart again. Okay?

732
01:01:19.054 --> 01:01:21.223
<i>George. we gotta go now. It's dinnertime.</i>

733
01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:24.351
<i>My lawyer said
you haven't signed the papers.</i>

734
01:01:24.434 --> 01:01:26.103
I told you I'd get to it.

735
01:01:26.186 --> 01:01:27.521
<i>Get to it soon.</i>

736
01:01:58.552 --> 01:01:59.970
I wanted to come sooner.

737
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:03.974
Why you sitting out in the car?
Why don't you come on inside?

738
01:02:07.561 --> 01:02:09.438
Doc said you fired Dick and Archie.

739
01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:11.899
Yeah.

740
01:02:12.774 --> 01:02:14.610
I lost a fight because of them.

741
01:02:17.196 --> 01:02:18.864
It's like Doc always said...

742
01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:22.951
I should've used my head
instead of my hands.

743
01:02:27.247 --> 01:02:28.665
He laid on the ropes...

744
01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:31.710
and I kept punching till I was tired.

745
01:02:34.463 --> 01:02:35.881
The rope-a-dope.

746
01:02:39.635 --> 01:02:40.928
And I was the dope.

747
01:02:42.387 --> 01:02:44.681
Look. I know you done had a hard time.

748
01:02:44.765 --> 01:02:47.643
but I can't stand
to hear you talking like this.

749
01:02:49.478 --> 01:02:52.272
<i>Foreman has been a dispirited.
lonely man</i>

750
01:02:52.356 --> 01:02:54.608
<i>through all of these six months
that have passed</i>

751
01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:57.402
<i>since Ali knocked him out
in the eighth round.</i>

752
01:02:57.486 --> 01:03:01.240
<i>Today. a boxing exhibition of sorts.</i>

753
01:03:01.323 --> 01:03:04.910
George Foreman.
former heavyweight champion of the world.

754
01:03:04.993 --> 01:03:08.372
will attempt to knock out
five fighters in one day.

755
01:03:09.456 --> 01:03:14.086
Exactly what he hopes to accomplish
by this is anybody's guess.

756
01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:18.006
George. you still got time to back out.

757
01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:19.675
You ain't gotta do this.

758
01:03:21.844 --> 01:03:25.264
Heavyweight champion
and world-class clown. Muhammad Ali.

759
01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:26.723
about to join me at the table.

760
01:03:26.807 --> 01:03:29.226
"Clown"? Howard. don't get hurt. now.

761
01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.396
There's the bell. And they're underway.

762
01:03:33.105 --> 01:03:34.940
Not his usual style. Muhammad.

763
01:03:35.023 --> 01:03:36.859
Yeah. I think he's trying to impress me.

764
01:03:36.942 --> 01:03:40.571
He's... He's bouncing around
like the Easter Bunny.

765
01:03:40.654 --> 01:03:42.948
Indeed. like a bunny. Muhammad.

766
01:03:44.408 --> 01:03:45.909
What are you doing?

767
01:03:45.993 --> 01:03:47.744
Get on them ropes. There you go.

768
01:03:47.828 --> 01:03:49.538
Stay on the ropes. Get on the ropes.

769
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.707
Ain't no wrestling match. George.

770
01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:53.792
Get on the ropes now. Make him work.

771
01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:58.839
Now Johnson is on the canvas.

772
01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:01.175
-Think that might be it for Alonzo.
-Can't you see he's down?

773
01:04:01.258 --> 01:04:03.260
-Seems to be a scuffle.
-Back off.

774
01:04:03.343 --> 01:04:05.012
Oh. there's a fight breaking out

775
01:04:05.095 --> 01:04:08.098
-between Foreman's trainers and Johnson's.
-Step back!

776
01:04:08.182 --> 01:04:11.059
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

777
01:04:11.143 --> 01:04:14.980
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

778
01:04:15.063 --> 01:04:18.400
Crowd is chanting. "Ali! Ali!"

779
01:04:18.483 --> 01:04:21.403
much to the consternation
of George Foreman.

780
01:04:21.486 --> 01:04:22.779
Ali!

781
01:04:23.488 --> 01:04:24.656
Give me another shot.

782
01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:27.826
I'm not getting back in the ring
with no chump. George.

783
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:29.828
That's 'cause you're scared of me.

784
01:04:29.912 --> 01:04:31.830
-Scared?
-You scared of me.

785
01:04:31.914 --> 01:04:33.957
Well. let's go right now. George.

786
01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:37.711
-Hold my jacket. Howard. Hold my jacket.
-Come on in the ring.

787
01:04:37.794 --> 01:04:41.548
-Let me go. Hold my jacket.
-Can't fight. You ain't no fighter.

788
01:04:41.632 --> 01:04:43.300
Man can't fight laying on no ropes.

789
01:04:43.383 --> 01:04:45.636
George. I'm too pretty
to fight someone as ugly as you.

790
01:04:45.719 --> 01:04:46.929
Come on in here.

791
01:04:47.012 --> 01:04:50.182
Go ahead. man. Go ahead. George.

792
01:04:50.265 --> 01:04:52.643
-That's what I thought. Always talk.
-I'm telling you.

793
01:04:52.726 --> 01:04:58.941
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

794
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.086
What did you think
you were gonna gain out there?

795
01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:20.754
Respect.

796
01:05:21.505 --> 01:05:24.007
Son. the beauty of boxing

797
01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:28.887
is that it shows a man
that can he do something all by himself.

798
01:05:30.389 --> 01:05:31.807
Something constructive.

799
01:05:36.228 --> 01:05:41.233
Let's go back to fighting them
one at a time. What you say?

800
01:05:47.364 --> 01:05:48.532
This just came through.

801
01:05:51.118 --> 01:05:51.952
Okay.

802
01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:54.037
It's for you.

803
01:06:06.717 --> 01:06:08.135
George. George.

804
01:06:09.845 --> 01:06:11.847
-What happened?
-Mary started bleeding.

805
01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:15.267
They're trying to save the baby.
but the air got cut off.

806
01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:17.811
Tell them. whatever it cost.
I'll pay for it.

807
01:06:17.895 --> 01:06:19.104
We need the best doctors.

808
01:06:19.188 --> 01:06:21.565
We already got the best doctors. George.

809
01:06:21.648 --> 01:06:24.484
The baby needs a miracle. We need to pray.

810
01:06:26.862 --> 01:06:27.696
Pray?

811
01:06:35.662 --> 01:06:38.665
Heavenly Father.
we are gathered here humbly.

812
01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:41.043
in the name of your son. Christ Jesus.

813
01:07:11.448 --> 01:07:13.825
All right. here I am.

814
01:07:18.622 --> 01:07:20.707
What did my sister ever do to you?

815
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:25.754
Mary's been sweet and kind
her whole life...

816
01:07:27.297 --> 01:07:28.966
to everybody in this world.

817
01:07:30.384 --> 01:07:31.218
To me.

818
01:07:32.052 --> 01:07:33.554
when I didn't deserve it.

819
01:07:35.222 --> 01:07:37.474
And you gonna take her baby?

820
01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:39.560
Answer me.

821
01:07:40.894 --> 01:07:43.063
Man. all my life
I've been hearing about you.

822
01:07:44.231 --> 01:07:46.441
And you ain't never shown me nothing.

823
01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:49.945
I ain't seen anything.

824
01:07:57.369 --> 01:07:59.204
If you wanna take somebody...

825
01:08:00.956 --> 01:08:01.957
you take me.

826
01:08:05.085 --> 01:08:07.296
You don't take my sister's baby. man.

827
01:08:10.591 --> 01:08:11.592
You take me.

828
01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:14.553
Please.

829
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:20.850
George.

830
01:08:38.076 --> 01:08:40.746
-Is he...?
-He's perfect.

831
01:08:42.622 --> 01:08:44.666
The doctors can't explain it.

832
01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:46.542
It's a miracle.

833
01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:49.171
That's...

834
01:08:51.298 --> 01:08:53.466
It's good. That's good.

835
01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.346
Well. come on over.

836
01:08:59.932 --> 01:09:01.808
Say hi to your nephew.

837
01:09:04.019 --> 01:09:05.229
Little George.

838
01:09:06.647 --> 01:09:07.773
Little George?

839
01:09:08.482 --> 01:09:09.316
Yeah.

840
01:09:13.487 --> 01:09:14.947
Mama told me you prayed.

841
01:09:18.242 --> 01:09:20.202
Whatever you said to him...

842
01:09:22.078 --> 01:09:23.205
it worked.

843
01:09:41.598 --> 01:09:43.517
<i>Jimmy Young! Jimmy Young!</i>

844
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.188
Listen to the crowd.
"Jimmy Young. Jimmy Young."

845
01:09:48.272 --> 01:09:51.649
Foreman hasn't been the same
since he lost to Ali.

846
01:09:51.733 --> 01:09:54.278
-He fired his old team...
-Come on. George.

847
01:09:54.361 --> 01:09:55.571
...but it hasn't worked.

848
01:09:57.656 --> 01:10:00.534
George's mind is just not in this fight.

849
01:10:18.969 --> 01:10:20.179
Let's go. All right.

850
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.856
Jimmy Young has won the fight
by unanimous decision.

851
01:10:30.939 --> 01:10:32.566
Promising future for Jimmy...

852
01:10:46.538 --> 01:10:47.956
Keep an eye on him. all right?

853
01:10:51.335 --> 01:10:52.961
What happened out there. George?

854
01:10:53.545 --> 01:10:54.922
Come on. Gil. It's just a fight.

855
01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:56.256
Every boxer has a bad one.

856
01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.509
He couldn't afford one.
It was our shot back to Ali.

857
01:10:58.592 --> 01:10:59.843
Man. it's hot.

858
01:11:00.969 --> 01:11:02.429
Why's it so hot in here?

859
01:11:08.894 --> 01:11:09.895
Who said that?

860
01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:12.564
Nobody said nothing. George.

861
01:11:16.235 --> 01:11:17.319
Who said that?

862
01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:23.075
-Who keeps talking?
-Nobody.

863
01:11:23.158 --> 01:11:24.910
Nobody's talking. George.

864
01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:26.286
George?

865
01:11:31.834 --> 01:11:32.960
I'm...

866
01:11:35.754 --> 01:11:37.005
I'm fixing...

867
01:11:37.089 --> 01:11:38.507
Whoa. George. George!

868
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:42.511
He's got a faint pulse.
We need to get him up on the table.

869
01:11:42.594 --> 01:11:43.428
On three.

870
01:11:43.512 --> 01:11:45.848
-One. two. three.
-Careful.

871
01:11:47.099 --> 01:11:50.519
-Easy.
-There you go. On the table. Here we go.

872
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:53.063
All right.

873
01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:54.898
-George?
-George?

874
01:11:55.482 --> 01:11:56.483
George.

875
01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:08.161
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

876
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.206
<i>I believe.</i>

877
01:12:14.042 --> 01:12:15.252
<i>I believe.</i>

878
01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:21.341
-Hey.
-Whoa. easy.

879
01:12:23.218 --> 01:12:24.386
George?

880
01:12:27.639 --> 01:12:29.183
We thought you was dead.

881
01:12:31.393 --> 01:12:32.394
I was.

882
01:12:38.108 --> 01:12:40.152
Jesus Christ is alive in me.

883
01:12:42.487 --> 01:12:43.697
He's alive in me.

884
01:12:44.323 --> 01:12:45.324
He's alive.

885
01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:47.075
I gotta get myself clean.

886
01:12:47.159 --> 01:12:49.328
Don't let him get in the shower.
Cold water will be a shock.

887
01:12:49.411 --> 01:12:51.622
-Wait!
-I gotta get myself clean.

888
01:12:51.705 --> 01:12:52.873
-Wait. No. George.
-Get off.

889
01:12:52.956 --> 01:12:55.542
I gotta get myself clean! Please. please.

890
01:12:55.626 --> 01:12:57.169
Hallelujah!

891
01:12:59.129 --> 01:13:00.422
Hallelujah!

892
01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:03.717
I'm clean.

893
01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:06.512
I'm clean.

894
01:13:09.556 --> 01:13:12.392
I'm clean. I'm clean.

895
01:13:12.476 --> 01:13:14.394
<i>I now baptize you</i>

896
01:13:14.478 --> 01:13:17.231
in the name of the Father.

897
01:13:17.314 --> 01:13:19.233
the son and the holy spirit.

898
01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:21.193
Hallelujah!

899
01:13:22.611 --> 01:13:24.071
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

900
01:13:34.623 --> 01:13:35.916
Hallelujah!

901
01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:42.798
<i>We are bearing witness to a miracle.</i>

902
01:13:42.881 --> 01:13:44.132
And Brother George...

903
01:13:44.842 --> 01:13:48.554
would like to share his version
of that miracle with you.

904
01:13:48.637 --> 01:13:50.472
So let's give a proper welcome

905
01:13:50.556 --> 01:13:53.392
to the former heavyweight champion
of the world

906
01:13:53.475 --> 01:13:56.603
and our new brother in Christ.
George Foreman!

907
01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:13.620
Thank you. Reverend Stokes.

908
01:14:16.874 --> 01:14:17.708
I...

909
01:14:18.876 --> 01:14:19.960
was in a fight.

910
01:14:23.755 --> 01:14:25.424
I used to love fighting.

911
01:14:38.645 --> 01:14:40.272
I was in the dressing room. and...

912
01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:44.693
And Jesus Christ came alive in me.

913
01:14:48.113 --> 01:14:48.947
And...

914
01:14:50.115 --> 01:14:51.325
And because of it...

915
01:14:52.534 --> 01:14:54.411
I wanna give my life to God.

916
01:14:58.498 --> 01:14:59.333
All right.

917
01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:01.502
I wanna be a preacher.

918
01:15:07.633 --> 01:15:08.634
Thank you. Jesus.

919
01:15:09.468 --> 01:15:11.303
-Praise God!
-All right.

920
01:15:12.179 --> 01:15:15.599
He may have finally found somebody
who can tell him what to do.

921
01:15:15.682 --> 01:15:17.267
Praise Jesus!

922
01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:19.520
-Hallelujah! Hallelujah.
-Hallelujah.

923
01:15:19.603 --> 01:15:20.979
-Yeah.
-Praise Jesus.

924
01:15:21.063 --> 01:15:22.189
Praise Jesus.

925
01:15:29.613 --> 01:15:31.615
You put on quite a show in there.

926
01:15:32.574 --> 01:15:34.368
I'm glad you was here to see it.

927
01:15:35.202 --> 01:15:38.789
So Gil's been setting the traps.
We still got us a path to Ali.

928
01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:40.749
I'm done.

929
01:15:41.792 --> 01:15:43.335
I'm not gonna box anymore.

930
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:47.923
-You a fighter.
-I'm not a fighter.

931
01:15:49.716 --> 01:15:50.801
Not anymore.

932
01:15:53.387 --> 01:15:55.222
So how are you gonna take care
of your kids?

933
01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:57.891
I'm gonna follow God.

934
01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:02.020
Do you know
what you're walking away from. son?

935
01:16:02.604 --> 01:16:03.856
You know. I...

936
01:16:03.939 --> 01:16:06.191
I can't even make a fist anymore. Doc.

937
01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:09.736
It's like he reached inside of me...

938
01:16:10.821 --> 01:16:12.948
just took out all my anger.

939
01:16:14.157 --> 01:16:15.701
That anger inside of you...

940
01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:17.786
it made you king.

941
01:16:18.745 --> 01:16:19.746
I saw it.

942
01:16:20.455 --> 01:16:22.875
Now you wanna tell me that it's all gone?

943
01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:27.337
Remember when you told me that
you traded in one uniform for another?

944
01:16:30.257 --> 01:16:31.592
That's what I'm doing.

945
01:16:33.594 --> 01:16:36.513
You can understand that. can't you?

946
01:16:36.597 --> 01:16:38.765
I had no say. George.

947
01:16:40.017 --> 01:16:41.727
My choice was made for me.

948
01:16:44.021 --> 01:16:45.272
So was mine.

949
01:16:49.776 --> 01:16:51.445
I don't believe you. George.

950
01:17:02.456 --> 01:17:06.460
<i>For 28 years.
I used my fists to get respect.</i>

951
01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:10.589
<i>I knew I had to start using my heart.</i>

952
01:17:13.383 --> 01:17:14.760
<i>I just didn't know how.</i>

953
01:17:16.553 --> 01:17:19.264
<i>She told me
Big George Foreman was at the door.</i>

954
01:17:20.015 --> 01:17:22.726
And I said. "Beatrice. you are crazy.

955
01:17:22.809 --> 01:17:24.895
George Foreman ain't coming
to see the champ

956
01:17:24.978 --> 01:17:27.314
unless he's looking for another whupping."

957
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:42.079
So I've come here...

958
01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:46.792
to tell you that I found Jesus.

959
01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:47.918
You found Jesus?

960
01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:51.713
Congratulations. George.
I did not know he was lost.

961
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.801
I came here...

962
01:17:57.761 --> 01:17:59.596
to ask for your forgiveness.

963
01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.723
-For my forgiveness?
-Yes.

964
01:18:01.807 --> 01:18:03.725
I'm the one who knocked you out.

965
01:18:03.809 --> 01:18:04.893
You know...

966
01:18:06.687 --> 01:18:07.980
after Zaire...

967
01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.234
I hated you. Muhammad.

968
01:18:13.527 --> 01:18:14.528
I did.

969
01:18:15.654 --> 01:18:17.281
And I wanted to kill you...

970
01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:19.533
with these hands.

971
01:18:19.616 --> 01:18:23.078
Come on. man.
You want a rematch. I know.

972
01:18:23.161 --> 01:18:24.329
Just come out and say it.

973
01:18:25.038 --> 01:18:26.498
I don't want no rematch.

974
01:18:26.999 --> 01:18:29.751
They told me you retired to preach.
but I didn't believe it.

975
01:18:29.835 --> 01:18:30.669
Well. I...

976
01:18:31.503 --> 01:18:32.921
I wanna help people.

977
01:18:33.005 --> 01:18:34.673
Well. George. help me. okay?

978
01:18:34.756 --> 01:18:37.759
All you got to do is fight Kenny Norton
one more time. Knock him out.

979
01:18:37.843 --> 01:18:40.596
Please. George. knock him out.
Because I sure can't.

980
01:18:40.679 --> 01:18:43.056
You knock him out.
he won't be a top-ranked contender.

981
01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:44.683
I'll give you another shot at the title.

982
01:18:44.766 --> 01:18:47.561
And then we'll both get paid. huh?
Praise Jesus.

983
01:18:52.691 --> 01:18:55.777
I can't help you that way.

984
01:19:01.742 --> 01:19:02.868
All right. brother.

985
01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:04.995
Fine.

986
01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:08.248
I forgive you.

987
01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:13.003
George Foreman. a preacher.

988
01:19:13.086 --> 01:19:15.047
Now I have seen it all.

989
01:19:23.972 --> 01:19:25.057
Hi!

990
01:19:27.267 --> 01:19:29.686
-What are you doing here?
-Hey. Michi.

991
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:33.190
-I love you.
-Michi. take your brother inside.

992
01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:35.192
Go inside. George.

993
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:40.948
What are you doing here?

994
01:19:46.995 --> 01:19:48.080
I came here...

995
01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:53.669
to tell you how sorry I am
for the way that I treated you.

996
01:19:56.797 --> 01:19:58.048
It wasn't right.

997
01:20:02.594 --> 01:20:06.598
"Let love be without dissimulation.

998
01:20:06.682 --> 01:20:08.892
Cleave to that which is good."

999
01:20:23.156 --> 01:20:23.991
Hi.

1000
01:20:27.494 --> 01:20:28.495
I'm George.

1001
01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.832
Mary Joan Martelly.

1002
01:20:31.915 --> 01:20:35.627
You were sitting in that same seat
the day I gave my testimony.

1003
01:20:41.008 --> 01:20:42.593
You always sat up front?

1004
01:20:43.427 --> 01:20:46.388
Yes. Helps me stay focused on God.

1005
01:20:53.812 --> 01:20:55.647
How's being a preacher going for you?

1006
01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:57.691
It's hard.

1007
01:20:58.734 --> 01:20:59.568
Real hard.

1008
01:21:00.068 --> 01:21:02.821
Harder than getting punched in the face?

1009
01:21:06.533 --> 01:21:09.411
Sometimes it feels about the same.

1010
01:21:10.996 --> 01:21:13.540
Blessed is the man who remains steadfast.

1011
01:21:21.298 --> 01:21:24.343
Brothers and sisters. I am out here today.

1012
01:21:24.968 --> 01:21:26.762
not to lift myself up.

1013
01:21:26.845 --> 01:21:29.348
but to lift up the name of Jesus Christ.

1014
01:21:29.973 --> 01:21:33.352
See. I was a man
who rejected all religion.

1015
01:21:33.435 --> 01:21:35.145
"Jesus" was a cussword to me.

1016
01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:37.606
but the Lord changed my life.

1017
01:21:37.689 --> 01:21:39.399
Wasn't the Lord who changed you.

1018
01:21:39.483 --> 01:21:42.778
It was Jimmy Young.
I seen him beat the hell out of you.

1019
01:21:42.861 --> 01:21:44.488
Did you at least pinch him?

1020
01:21:46.615 --> 01:21:49.618
Don't you miss being in that ring.
big fella?

1021
01:21:53.205 --> 01:21:54.373
I'll die...

1022
01:21:54.915 --> 01:21:57.125
before I get back in that ring again.

1023
01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.294
Now...

1024
01:22:04.424 --> 01:22:07.970
Now. you could take
all of the Rockefellers' money

1025
01:22:08.053 --> 01:22:09.972
and all of the Kennedys' money.

1026
01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:11.598
and you put that together.

1027
01:22:11.682 --> 01:22:14.893
it wouldn't come to a down payment
on my getting back in that ring again.

1028
01:22:18.021 --> 01:22:20.315
Praise God. Thank you. Jesus.

1029
01:22:20.399 --> 01:22:22.317
Jesus is alive today.

1030
01:22:24.444 --> 01:22:25.279
I...

1031
01:22:26.029 --> 01:22:28.532
I felt bad for how I acted last Sunday.

1032
01:22:28.615 --> 01:22:31.326
-Well. how did you act?
-Kind of cold.

1033
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:35.664
-Yes.
-Well. you had a reputation.

1034
01:22:35.747 --> 01:22:37.541
And not a godly one.

1035
01:22:39.293 --> 01:22:40.711
Well. I'm different now.

1036
01:22:41.587 --> 01:22:44.006
You know. I hadn't yet learnt the secret

1037
01:22:44.089 --> 01:22:47.134
to enjoying every day for itself.

1038
01:22:47.217 --> 01:22:50.721
How to make the most of each day
as it comes.

1039
01:22:50.804 --> 01:22:52.097
Do you have children?

1040
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:55.934
Yes.

1041
01:22:56.977 --> 01:22:59.688
They don't live with me full-time.
you know. which is hard.

1042
01:22:59.771 --> 01:23:03.108
but I'm gonna be seeing
a whole lot more of them now.

1043
01:23:04.067 --> 01:23:04.902
Yes. indeed.

1044
01:23:06.028 --> 01:23:07.362
I'm glad to hear that.

1045
01:23:14.745 --> 01:23:16.496
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1046
01:23:45.943 --> 01:23:46.777
You okay?

1047
01:23:47.444 --> 01:23:49.988
-Yeah. Yeah.
-I thought we were going to a movie.

1048
01:23:52.533 --> 01:23:53.951
I wanna show you something.

1049
01:23:55.410 --> 01:23:57.162
What's that look like to you?

1050
01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:00.541
A church that's run out of faith.

1051
01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:03.252
No.

1052
01:24:04.086 --> 01:24:05.712
You know. I'm gonna buy it.

1053
01:24:07.256 --> 01:24:08.966
And I'm gonna preach in it.

1054
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:12.052
And be the best I can be.

1055
01:24:13.428 --> 01:24:15.347
And I'm gonna spread his word.

1056
01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:22.104
Do you believe I can do that?

1057
01:24:22.771 --> 01:24:23.772
Yes.

1058
01:24:24.439 --> 01:24:25.440
I do.

1059
01:24:32.197 --> 01:24:36.702
<i>You got to fight for your faith.
Every one of you. every day.</i>

1060
01:24:36.785 --> 01:24:41.164
One Sunday morning.
when the sun is shining real bright...

1061
01:24:44.251 --> 01:24:47.880
and your husband. he's standing there
with his swim trunks on.

1062
01:24:48.964 --> 01:24:50.174
holding a blanket.

1063
01:24:50.966 --> 01:24:52.885
saying. "The beach is waiting. baby!"

1064
01:24:53.677 --> 01:24:55.262
And you think to yourself. you say:

1065
01:24:57.014 --> 01:25:00.350
"Is missing one little service
really gonna hurt me?"

1066
01:25:03.312 --> 01:25:07.232
Now. if you don't shine your shoes.
do they get shined?

1067
01:25:07.316 --> 01:25:08.150
No.

1068
01:25:08.233 --> 01:25:11.028
-Don't wash your clothes. they get washed?
-No.

1069
01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:14.198
If you don't fight for your faith.
it'll fall away.

1070
01:25:15.699 --> 01:25:17.910
You gotta do it.
Gotta fight for your faith.

1071
01:25:17.993 --> 01:25:19.536
If you gonna fight for anything.
fight for that.

1072
01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.454
Amen.

1073
01:25:22.372 --> 01:25:24.291
Thank you. All right. Take care.

1074
01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:26.502
All right. All right.

1075
01:25:26.585 --> 01:25:27.836
Pastor Foreman.

1076
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:29.963
I need your help.

1077
01:25:31.006 --> 01:25:33.091
Would you train my grandson. Jalen?

1078
01:25:33.759 --> 01:25:36.053
If he had a good male role model
to teach him.

1079
01:25:36.136 --> 01:25:38.096
instead of the boys that he's...

1080
01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:42.601
Well. I'd sign up to train with Ali
but not the guy who lost to him.

1081
01:25:42.684 --> 01:25:45.979
-Jalen...
-It's all right. It's all right.

1082
01:25:46.063 --> 01:25:48.065
He remind me of myself when I was his age.

1083
01:25:48.148 --> 01:25:49.525
Can you teach him to box?

1084
01:25:49.608 --> 01:25:51.443
Well. boxing's not the answer.

1085
01:25:51.527 --> 01:25:53.278
You see. the answers are in here.

1086
01:25:53.362 --> 01:25:54.947
Young man. you read the Bible.

1087
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:57.032
keep coming to church.
everything will work out.

1088
01:25:57.115 --> 01:25:59.743
All right.
All right. sister. God bless you.

1089
01:25:59.826 --> 01:26:01.578
-Have a good day. All right.
-Okay.

1090
01:26:02.538 --> 01:26:03.997
Something smells good in here.

1091
01:26:09.628 --> 01:26:11.255
-I love you.
-I love you.

1092
01:26:12.422 --> 01:26:13.423
Hey!

1093
01:26:15.133 --> 01:26:16.385
You're getting heavy.

1094
01:26:16.468 --> 01:26:17.469
Come here. boy.

1095
01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:19.012
-You know I love you. right?
-Yeah.

1096
01:26:19.096 --> 01:26:21.139
-All right. let me get a kiss.
-No. No way.

1097
01:26:21.223 --> 01:26:23.517
Give me a kiss. Come here.
Don't wanna kiss your daddy?

1098
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.687
<i>...to the epidemic of street violence
that's been plaguing the Fifth Ward.</i>

1099
01:26:26.770 --> 01:26:29.231
<i>Two suspects have been apprehended
in this robbery.</i>

1100
01:26:29.314 --> 01:26:31.984
<i>-An attempted robbery...
</i>-Take your brother to the other room.

1101
01:26:32.067 --> 01:26:33.986
<i>...with one man in critical condition.</i>

1102
01:26:34.069 --> 01:26:36.613
<i>The juveniles are being held without bail.</i>

1103
01:26:39.575 --> 01:26:40.576
You okay?

1104
01:26:45.998 --> 01:26:47.791
His grandmother brought him to me...

1105
01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:50.002
last week.

1106
01:26:50.627 --> 01:26:51.920
That same kid.

1107
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:57.801
But I was so. you know.
full of myself being full of God that...

1108
01:27:00.804 --> 01:27:01.889
I missed it.

1109
01:27:02.806 --> 01:27:04.349
What did you miss. George?

1110
01:27:07.102 --> 01:27:09.188
I should have met that kid where he was.

1111
01:27:11.732 --> 01:27:13.483
Not where I wanted him to be.

1112
01:27:20.741 --> 01:27:23.952
George. are you sure you wanna do this?

1113
01:27:25.537 --> 01:27:26.538
Yeah.

1114
01:27:27.331 --> 01:27:31.877
Okay. I'll talk to the bank about moving
a few of your assets around.

1115
01:27:33.128 --> 01:27:34.838
Come on.
I wanna show y'all something here.

1116
01:27:36.089 --> 01:27:37.716
Now. I have an idea.

1117
01:27:48.477 --> 01:27:49.728
All right. I got you.

1118
01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:53.857
That's heavy.

1119
01:27:53.941 --> 01:27:55.984
Help me with this bed over here!

1120
01:27:59.863 --> 01:28:01.156
Hurry up. now.

1121
01:28:04.284 --> 01:28:05.869
That's looking good.

1122
01:28:11.959 --> 01:28:14.211
-Tighten up these ropes.
-Hook that up.

1123
01:28:14.294 --> 01:28:15.921
-Make sure they're not loose.
-Got it.

1124
01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.486
I would've blocked it.
but somebody raised the rim.

1125
01:28:39.570 --> 01:28:41.071
Hey. fellas. Come on in.

1126
01:28:42.114 --> 01:28:43.740
Come on in. Enjoy yourself.

1127
01:29:00.632 --> 01:29:02.551
Hey. Nate. Ain't seen you in a while.

1128
01:29:02.634 --> 01:29:05.345
Hey. nice haircut. man.
Look. it's almost as good as mine.

1129
01:29:07.181 --> 01:29:08.557
What's going on. y'all?

1130
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:10.267
Hey. sister. How you doing?

1131
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:11.435
Good. good.

1132
01:29:11.518 --> 01:29:14.688
Hey. man. You're always fouling somebody.
I see you.

1133
01:29:15.898 --> 01:29:17.065
Looking good.

1134
01:29:22.321 --> 01:29:23.405
I got this. y'all.

1135
01:29:24.072 --> 01:29:25.115
Don't worry about it.

1136
01:29:25.199 --> 01:29:28.202
This has never happened here
at the youth center before.

1137
01:29:28.285 --> 01:29:30.704
-This just doesn't make any sense.
-Roberta. what's going on?

1138
01:29:31.663 --> 01:29:35.292
Are you absolutely sure?
Because it just doesn't sound right.

1139
01:29:38.128 --> 01:29:42.090
Okay. No. I understand.
We'll take care of it immediately.

1140
01:29:46.303 --> 01:29:48.805
Power company said we never paid the bill.

1141
01:29:49.556 --> 01:29:50.390
Really?

1142
01:29:50.974 --> 01:29:54.061
Well. just get Des on it.

1143
01:29:54.645 --> 01:29:56.188
He didn't come in today.

1144
01:29:57.564 --> 01:29:58.941
<i>I'm sorry. Mr. Foreman.</i>

1145
01:29:59.024 --> 01:30:00.901
but I don't understand
how you didn't know.

1146
01:30:00.984 --> 01:30:02.027
How much is left?

1147
01:30:02.110 --> 01:30:03.904
A little over $2000.

1148
01:30:03.987 --> 01:30:05.197
That can't be right.

1149
01:30:06.365 --> 01:30:08.575
Just use some of the money
from my investments accounts

1150
01:30:08.659 --> 01:30:09.826
to keep the youth center open.

1151
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:12.037
Those investments went belly-up
over the last year.

1152
01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:13.622
Des told me we were good.

1153
01:30:13.705 --> 01:30:15.582
I'm sorry. but that's just not true.

1154
01:30:15.666 --> 01:30:18.085
He put them into solid stocks
to set me up for life.

1155
01:30:18.168 --> 01:30:20.879
No. These were all high-risk gambles.

1156
01:30:20.963 --> 01:30:22.172
No. that's--

1157
01:30:22.256 --> 01:30:25.759
Look. I'm sorry. Mr. Foreman.
but if these payments aren't made soon.

1158
01:30:25.843 --> 01:30:28.512
the bank will have
to start repossessing the property.

1159
01:30:58.667 --> 01:31:01.461
Roy says you got the whole town
looking for Desmond.

1160
01:31:02.379 --> 01:31:03.380
That's right.

1161
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:06.842
You need to leave him be.

1162
01:31:09.011 --> 01:31:10.721
I gave it all to him.

1163
01:31:13.348 --> 01:31:14.641
And he lost it.

1164
01:31:17.352 --> 01:31:18.896
Not just the youth center.

1165
01:31:23.567 --> 01:31:26.195
Everything I worked for...

1166
01:31:29.781 --> 01:31:30.824
it's gone.

1167
01:31:30.908 --> 01:31:31.909
No. no. no.

1168
01:31:33.118 --> 01:31:36.330
Everything you worked for is in here.

1169
01:31:40.959 --> 01:31:43.170
Ever since you was a little boy...

1170
01:31:46.423 --> 01:31:49.009
I tried to put you on the right path.

1171
01:31:51.678 --> 01:31:52.846
But you found it.

1172
01:31:53.847 --> 01:31:55.265
All by yourself.

1173
01:31:56.308 --> 01:31:57.559
You found God.

1174
01:31:59.144 --> 01:32:00.312
Be godly.

1175
01:32:03.815 --> 01:32:06.944
Don't let Desmond Baker take that
from you too.

1176
01:32:36.139 --> 01:32:36.974
Tell me.

1177
01:32:37.766 --> 01:32:41.895
Tell me you put the money somewhere else.
In some other account I don't know about!

1178
01:32:42.646 --> 01:32:44.815
-Tell me it's not all gone.
-It's gone.

1179
01:32:44.898 --> 01:32:47.526
-I lost it.
-Tell me it's not all gone.

1180
01:32:47.609 --> 01:32:48.819
I lost it.

1181
01:32:59.413 --> 01:33:01.164
I'm sorry. George.

1182
01:33:10.674 --> 01:33:12.843
Any time you're ready. Mr. Foreman.

1183
01:33:13.427 --> 01:33:16.054
This summer.
when you're out grilling with the family.

1184
01:33:16.138 --> 01:33:18.891
there's only one sauce
that has the sweetness and the spiceness

1185
01:33:18.974 --> 01:33:20.559
that everyone loves.

1186
01:33:20.642 --> 01:33:22.227
-Miss--
-You said "spiceness." George.

1187
01:33:23.061 --> 01:33:24.062
I did?

1188
01:33:24.146 --> 01:33:26.607
Yeah. "Spiceness" isn't a word.

1189
01:33:31.653 --> 01:33:34.031
Hi. How are you? Thank you.

1190
01:33:34.114 --> 01:33:36.533
Can you sign this. champ? Thank you.

1191
01:33:37.576 --> 01:33:38.577
-Hello.
-Hi.

1192
01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:39.661
Thank you so much.

1193
01:33:43.916 --> 01:33:45.125
Thank you so much.

1194
01:33:47.169 --> 01:33:48.378
Thank you.

1195
01:33:51.215 --> 01:33:53.050
When you're out grilling with the family.

1196
01:33:53.133 --> 01:33:57.054
there's only one sauce
that has the sweetness and the spice

1197
01:33:57.137 --> 01:33:58.680
that everyone loves.

1198
01:34:00.015 --> 01:34:03.352
Miss Tammie's Mesquite
and Original Barbecue Sauce.

1199
01:34:03.435 --> 01:34:04.686
Get them while they're hot.

1200
01:34:06.355 --> 01:34:09.441
Adding in the money
from Miss Tammie's commercial...

1201
01:34:10.817 --> 01:34:12.027
Chump change.

1202
01:34:13.529 --> 01:34:16.448
That's what they pay you
for looking like a chump on TV.

1203
01:34:16.532 --> 01:34:18.492
Every little bit counts. George.

1204
01:34:18.575 --> 01:34:20.202
I done sold everything I have.

1205
01:34:21.995 --> 01:34:23.539
I done cut every corner.

1206
01:34:27.167 --> 01:34:28.168
How are we?

1207
01:34:32.923 --> 01:34:34.174
Short.

1208
01:34:34.758 --> 01:34:35.884
Well. how short?

1209
01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:38.387
Not even close.

1210
01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:11.813
I know you hate this thing.

1211
01:36:11.897 --> 01:36:13.649
It's just a bag. I don't hate it.

1212
01:36:14.274 --> 01:36:15.776
It is filthy though.

1213
01:36:18.487 --> 01:36:20.697
-Come to bed.
-I'm not tired.

1214
01:36:20.781 --> 01:36:22.658
But you have a sermon to give tomorrow.

1215
01:36:22.741 --> 01:36:24.284
Pastor Carl's filling in for me.

1216
01:36:24.368 --> 01:36:25.619
Why?

1217
01:36:27.204 --> 01:36:29.206
So I ain't gotta stand up there.

1218
01:36:29.289 --> 01:36:31.291
tell all those people
how they should live.

1219
01:36:31.375 --> 01:36:33.377
That's what a pastor does. right?

1220
01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:35.754
It's my fault the money's gone. Joan.

1221
01:36:36.463 --> 01:36:37.840
Don't say that. George.

1222
01:36:37.923 --> 01:36:39.591
Well. I knew what Des was.

1223
01:36:41.176 --> 01:36:42.886
And I trusted him anyway?

1224
01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:55.148
I need to fight again.

1225
01:36:59.194 --> 01:37:00.988
You swore you wouldn't.

1226
01:37:04.116 --> 01:37:07.077
That moment when you first
came up to me in church.

1227
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:11.456
I saw a man who wanted to change his life.

1228
01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:13.500
I fell in love with that man.

1229
01:37:14.543 --> 01:37:17.838
The old you. I don't know.

1230
01:37:17.921 --> 01:37:19.298
And I don't want to.

1231
01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:21.175
Joan.

1232
01:37:22.509 --> 01:37:24.928
There's only two things I know how to do.

1233
01:37:26.597 --> 01:37:28.849
That's box and preach.

1234
01:37:31.685 --> 01:37:32.853
But preaching...

1235
01:37:36.773 --> 01:37:38.567
Preaching won't pay the bills.

1236
01:37:39.318 --> 01:37:41.403
What if all your rage comes back?

1237
01:37:45.324 --> 01:37:47.284
What if you can't win without it?

1238
01:37:51.705 --> 01:37:54.082
Step forward. Step back.

1239
01:37:54.166 --> 01:37:56.460
Step to the left. To the right.

1240
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:59.296
Step forward. Step back.

1241
01:37:59.379 --> 01:38:02.049
Step left. Step right.

1242
01:38:02.132 --> 01:38:04.468
Step forward. Step back.

1243
01:38:04.551 --> 01:38:06.762
Step left. Step right. Great.

1244
01:38:06.845 --> 01:38:09.306
Now. Now. cut me off! Cut me off.

1245
01:38:12.267 --> 01:38:13.644
<i>When you quit boxing...</i>

1246
01:38:16.438 --> 01:38:18.440
you dang near broke my heart.

1247
01:38:21.151 --> 01:38:22.694
It felt like you quit me.

1248
01:38:25.781 --> 01:38:27.074
But I came back here.

1249
01:38:27.699 --> 01:38:29.201
I dug back in.

1250
01:38:30.077 --> 01:38:30.911
And...

1251
01:38:31.787 --> 01:38:33.622
you know. funny thing happened.

1252
01:38:33.705 --> 01:38:35.666
I remembered who I was.

1253
01:38:38.710 --> 01:38:40.295
I'm happy here. George.

1254
01:38:41.588 --> 01:38:43.590
You made me something once. Doc.

1255
01:38:45.217 --> 01:38:46.844
You can do it again.

1256
01:38:46.927 --> 01:38:49.137
Joe Louis tried to come back.

1257
01:38:49.847 --> 01:38:52.015
Marciano almost killed him in the ring.

1258
01:38:52.099 --> 01:38:56.019
Joe Louis tried to start at the top.
But we'll start at the bottom.

1259
01:38:56.103 --> 01:38:58.772
You're old. They'll call us a circus act.

1260
01:38:58.856 --> 01:39:00.816
But not if we keep winning.

1261
01:39:01.441 --> 01:39:02.442
Doc.

1262
01:39:03.735 --> 01:39:05.821
You know. we can do something here.

1263
01:39:06.947 --> 01:39:09.950
Something that's beyond their imagination.

1264
01:39:11.410 --> 01:39:16.582
The morning that we wake up to fight
for that heavyweight championship belt...

1265
01:39:17.624 --> 01:39:19.960
oh. man.

1266
01:39:20.043 --> 01:39:21.962
the air's gonna taste different.

1267
01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:26.258
The sun. that's gonna look different.

1268
01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:30.929
Only two men
on this whole earth is gonna matter.

1269
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:33.265
And we'll be the both of them.

1270
01:39:41.815 --> 01:39:42.941
How much you weigh?

1271
01:39:44.234 --> 01:39:45.611
How much I wait?

1272
01:39:45.694 --> 01:39:47.946
I said. how much do you weigh?

1273
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:49.323
Oh. how much I weigh.

1274
01:39:50.490 --> 01:39:52.576
-Like on a scale.
-Yeah.

1275
01:39:55.913 --> 01:39:58.665
About 299.

1276
01:39:58.749 --> 01:40:02.002
Really more toward the 85 range.
but about 29--

1277
01:40:02.085 --> 01:40:03.462
I would say 299.

1278
01:40:03.545 --> 01:40:05.797
Last I checked. lying was a sin.

1279
01:40:09.927 --> 01:40:12.679
I'm about 315.

1280
01:40:12.763 --> 01:40:15.057
318 after breakfast.

1281
01:40:15.891 --> 01:40:18.185
You get down to 265...

1282
01:40:19.645 --> 01:40:20.687
then call me.

1283
01:40:39.373 --> 01:40:41.166
I think my gym clothes shrunk.

1284
01:40:55.556 --> 01:40:57.432
Hey. George. take it easy. man.

1285
01:40:58.517 --> 01:41:00.060
You're gonna have a heart attack.

1286
01:41:04.022 --> 01:41:05.566
That's nasty. George.

1287
01:41:35.387 --> 01:41:37.347
All right. who's ready for pancakes?

1288
01:41:37.431 --> 01:41:40.017
I'm ready for pancakes. Yes. indeed.

1289
01:41:41.268 --> 01:41:42.311
There you go. baby.

1290
01:41:42.394 --> 01:41:45.147
Yep. I'm gonna get me. like. five of them.

1291
01:42:51.255 --> 01:42:53.966
Okay. Get on up there.

1292
01:42:54.591 --> 01:42:55.968
That's where the fighting is.

1293
01:42:59.012 --> 01:43:00.013
Time!

1294
01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:16.655
Come on. cut him off!

1295
01:43:18.365 --> 01:43:19.658
Cut him off!

1296
01:43:20.492 --> 01:43:21.785
Cut him off!

1297
01:43:28.125 --> 01:43:29.293
Move your feet.

1298
01:43:32.963 --> 01:43:34.673
Come on. Come on. George.

1299
01:43:37.509 --> 01:43:38.635
Time!

1300
01:43:45.225 --> 01:43:48.187
We're gonna need
to get you some new tricks.

1301
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:51.732
Some new arms
and some new legs might help too.

1302
01:43:52.941 --> 01:43:55.652
This ain't funny. George.
This ain't funny.

1303
01:44:24.348 --> 01:44:25.432
What's wrong?

1304
01:44:30.729 --> 01:44:33.732
I think the Lord spoke to me last night.

1305
01:44:47.579 --> 01:44:49.081
Well. what'd he say?

1306
01:44:53.085 --> 01:44:54.711
He showed me a vision.

1307
01:44:56.338 --> 01:44:57.339
Of you.

1308
01:44:57.923 --> 01:45:00.843
Winning
the heavyweight championship again.

1309
01:45:05.389 --> 01:45:06.890
I can't explain it.

1310
01:45:09.142 --> 01:45:10.143
It's like...

1311
01:45:11.979 --> 01:45:16.024
he's gonna lift you up
in the middle of that ring.

1312
01:45:16.108 --> 01:45:19.528
so you'll lift him up
in front of millions of people.

1313
01:45:41.175 --> 01:45:42.593
How you feeling?

1314
01:45:44.887 --> 01:45:45.888
I feel good.

1315
01:45:46.597 --> 01:45:48.182
This is for real tonight.

1316
01:45:49.558 --> 01:45:52.769
It's time to wake up that old tiger
and put him back to work.

1317
01:45:54.438 --> 01:45:55.814
That man's gone. Doc.

1318
01:45:57.274 --> 01:45:59.026
We gonna do this a new way now.

1319
01:45:59.109 --> 01:46:01.153
Son. there's no new way
when it come to that ring.

1320
01:46:01.945 --> 01:46:03.614
There's him and there's you.

1321
01:46:03.697 --> 01:46:05.824
There's hurt or be hurt.

1322
01:46:06.742 --> 01:46:08.493
-It's fighting.
-It's boxing.

1323
01:46:10.454 --> 01:46:11.455
It's a sport.

1324
01:46:12.706 --> 01:46:13.707
With rules.

1325
01:46:18.545 --> 01:46:20.214
Better know what you're doing.

1326
01:46:39.775 --> 01:46:44.279
It's been ten years since George Foreman
set foot in a boxing ring.

1327
01:46:44.363 --> 01:46:48.033
What does
this Foreman reincarnation even look like?

1328
01:46:48.116 --> 01:46:51.995
Hey. Zouski's no world champion.
but he's a seasoned fighter.

1329
01:46:52.079 --> 01:46:53.956
and George has danger in there tonight.

1330
01:46:54.039 --> 01:46:56.375
You know what scares me
the most about tonight?

1331
01:46:56.458 --> 01:46:57.709
Getting knocked out by a bum?

1332
01:46:58.377 --> 01:46:59.211
No.

1333
01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.256
Taking my robe off
in front of all these people.

1334
01:47:02.881 --> 01:47:05.425
The last time they saw me.
I looked like Superman.

1335
01:47:05.509 --> 01:47:09.054
So now you look like the Michelin Man.
This ain't no beauty contest.

1336
01:47:16.436 --> 01:47:17.479
All right!

1337
01:47:27.614 --> 01:47:31.201
Gentlemen. I gave you instructions
in the dressing room.

1338
01:47:31.285 --> 01:47:33.412
Obey my commands.

1339
01:47:33.495 --> 01:47:36.540
Give me a good clean fight. George...

1340
01:47:36.623 --> 01:47:39.543
Don't look at him.
He's trying to mess with your mind.

1341
01:47:39.626 --> 01:47:40.627
Touch them up.

1342
01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:42.713
Come on. let's go.

1343
01:47:47.885 --> 01:47:52.472
So George Foreman begins
the most unlikely of comebacks.

1344
01:47:52.556 --> 01:47:55.309
-All right. George.
-Keep your hands up. Keep your hands up.

1345
01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:00.522
This Sacramento crowd is getting restless.

1346
01:48:00.606 --> 01:48:03.358
-Quit dancing!
-They're looking for some action.

1347
01:48:08.322 --> 01:48:09.907
Stop playing with him.

1348
01:48:14.119 --> 01:48:16.496
You come here to fight
or you wanna go home? Come on!

1349
01:48:17.164 --> 01:48:18.916
Let's do this. Let's fight.
You wanna fight?

1350
01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:27.716
There it is.

1351
01:48:31.178 --> 01:48:33.055
Cheap shot after the bell.

1352
01:48:50.697 --> 01:48:51.740
Let him out.

1353
01:48:53.242 --> 01:48:56.036
It's now or never.
You let him out. Let him out.

1354
01:48:56.119 --> 01:48:57.663
I'm gonna do this my way. Doc.

1355
01:48:59.331 --> 01:49:00.707
I'm gonna do it my way.

1356
01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:18.517
I'll tell you this.
George can still punch.

1357
01:49:23.397 --> 01:49:25.983
Come on! Hit him like you hit Frazier!

1358
01:49:30.404 --> 01:49:31.697
Finish him!

1359
01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:32.990
Finish him!

1360
01:49:35.826 --> 01:49:38.495
He has Zouski in huge trouble.

1361
01:49:38.579 --> 01:49:40.205
Yeah. that's it. That's it.

1362
01:49:41.290 --> 01:49:43.584
Come on. man.
Can't you see he's hurt? Stop the fight.

1363
01:49:43.667 --> 01:49:45.085
Do your job. Come on.

1364
01:49:46.295 --> 01:49:47.462
Do your job.

1365
01:49:48.255 --> 01:49:49.882
Come on. George.

1366
01:49:53.635 --> 01:49:57.639
-That's enough. That's enough.
-And it's done. The ref has seen enough.

1367
01:49:57.723 --> 01:50:01.435
Foreman takes his first step back
with a big win.

1368
01:50:11.111 --> 01:50:13.906
Let's hear it
for fat. old. bald guys. huh?

1369
01:50:13.989 --> 01:50:16.158
Yeah! Go get them. George!

1370
01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:21.663
<i>That rumble you hear is
the George Foreman Comeback Express.</i>

1371
01:50:21.747 --> 01:50:24.625
<i>You best believe
it's picking up some serious steam.</i>

1372
01:50:24.708 --> 01:50:26.043
<i>There's an old saying:</i>

1373
01:50:26.126 --> 01:50:28.045
<i>"It's not the size
of the man in the fight.</i>

1374
01:50:28.128 --> 01:50:30.422
<i>but the size of the fight in the man."</i>

1375
01:50:30.506 --> 01:50:34.009
<i>All those ring experts
who were making fun of George's size</i>

1376
01:50:34.092 --> 01:50:35.844
<i>sure aren't laughing anymore.</i>

1377
01:50:36.678 --> 01:50:40.390
<i>Foreman is forcing the boxing world
to stand up and pay attention.</i>

1378
01:50:41.058 --> 01:50:44.853
<i>Never before has a boxer stayed away
from the ring this long.</i>

1379
01:50:44.937 --> 01:50:46.855
<i>then fought his way back into contention.</i>

1380
01:50:46.939 --> 01:50:50.234
<i>Just how far. how high can he take this?</i>

1381
01:50:55.989 --> 01:50:59.660
Back tonight. please welcome
former heavyweight champion of the world.

1382
01:50:59.743 --> 01:51:01.078
George Foreman.

1383
01:51:02.663 --> 01:51:04.540
-Good to see you. George.
-Good to see you.

1384
01:51:06.083 --> 01:51:07.709
Now. tell me. George.

1385
01:51:07.793 --> 01:51:11.046
all these guys you've been fighting.
where do you find them?

1386
01:51:11.129 --> 01:51:14.800
Gas stations. barrooms.
and bowling alleys. mostly.

1387
01:51:16.426 --> 01:51:19.263
-Sounds like pretty stiff competition.
-Oh. yeah.

1388
01:51:19.346 --> 01:51:21.807
But I'm tired of people saying
I'll only fight these guys

1389
01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:24.768
unless they on respirators.
'cause that's a lie.

1390
01:51:24.852 --> 01:51:28.146
They gotta be off the respirator
at least five days before I fight them.

1391
01:51:29.481 --> 01:51:31.233
Now. tell us about your sons. George.

1392
01:51:31.316 --> 01:51:32.484
I got four boys.

1393
01:51:32.568 --> 01:51:34.528
Now. the names are. again...?

1394
01:51:34.611 --> 01:51:39.074
George Foreman Jr.. George Foreman III.
George Foreman IV. and George Foreman V.

1395
01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:43.537
I wanted them all to have something
in common. No different names.

1396
01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:45.956
If one goes up. we all go up.

1397
01:51:46.039 --> 01:51:48.667
If one gets in trouble.
we all get in trouble.

1398
01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:49.751
How about that?

1399
01:51:51.128 --> 01:51:54.381
You're going to fight Evander Holyfield
in Atlantic City. right?

1400
01:51:54.464 --> 01:51:55.465
Yes!

1401
01:51:55.549 --> 01:51:59.052
It is my destiny to win
the heavyweight championship belt again.

1402
01:51:59.136 --> 01:52:00.679
It is time. kids!

1403
01:52:02.514 --> 01:52:04.433
Okay. all right. Here we go.

1404
01:52:06.602 --> 01:52:09.021
<i>And we're back for the seventh round.</i>

1405
01:52:09.104 --> 01:52:11.732
<i>Holyfield. as expected.
is well ahead on the cards.</i>

1406
01:52:11.815 --> 01:52:12.816
Your will. Lord.

1407
01:52:14.151 --> 01:52:17.070
<i>And he rocks Foreman again
with a vicious left.</i>

1408
01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.033
<i>George is still standing.
But for how long?</i>

1409
01:52:22.367 --> 01:52:24.286
<i>It's Foreman on the attack now.</i>

1410
01:52:25.078 --> 01:52:26.496
That's it. George.

1411
01:52:27.664 --> 01:52:30.125
<i>What a shot! Holyfield is wobbly.</i>

1412
01:52:31.084 --> 01:52:34.880
<i>Solid punches! Nobody thought
Foreman would even last this long.</i>

1413
01:52:36.048 --> 01:52:38.258
-Get him.
<i>-A round for the ages.</i>

1414
01:52:38.342 --> 01:52:41.136
<i>George Foreman is for real.</i>

1415
01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:43.305
<i>And the crowd is up on its feet.</i>

1416
01:52:43.388 --> 01:52:49.311
<i>117 to 100.
for the winner by unanimous decision.</i>

1417
01:52:49.394 --> 01:52:55.025
<i>and still undisputed heavyweight champion
of the world.</i>

1418
01:52:55.108 --> 01:53:00.280
<i>Evander Holyfield.</i>

1419
01:53:02.866 --> 01:53:04.284
Mr. Foreman.

1420
01:53:05.911 --> 01:53:06.954
Great fight.

1421
01:53:07.037 --> 01:53:09.164
One more round
and you would have had him.

1422
01:53:09.248 --> 01:53:10.082
Thank you.

1423
01:53:15.337 --> 01:53:16.421
Have a seat.

1424
01:53:20.926 --> 01:53:22.177
Good morning.

1425
01:53:22.261 --> 01:53:23.512
What brings you in today?

1426
01:53:23.595 --> 01:53:26.223
I just wanna stay
on top of things this time.

1427
01:53:26.849 --> 01:53:29.434
-Did the HBO check come in?
-Just this morning.

1428
01:53:30.102 --> 01:53:33.272
They said they were hoping
to just break even on the fight.

1429
01:53:40.404 --> 01:53:41.405
What?

1430
01:53:52.624 --> 01:53:54.918
I think you'll enjoy
the rest of your statement too.

1431
01:53:55.002 --> 01:53:56.837
That funny little grill deal you signed

1432
01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:59.715
is starting to generate
some substantial checks.

1433
01:53:59.798 --> 01:54:00.841
Really?

1434
01:54:00.924 --> 01:54:04.136
I'm just surprised
they chose a big. old fat guy like me

1435
01:54:04.219 --> 01:54:06.096
to sell a grill to help people get lean.

1436
01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:07.764
The youth center?

1437
01:54:07.848 --> 01:54:11.268
There's enough money in the account
to keep it open a very long time.

1438
01:54:11.935 --> 01:54:14.605
I think it's safe to say you never have
to fight again. Mr. Foreman.

1439
01:54:15.647 --> 01:54:17.566
Oh. praise the Lord.

1440
01:54:22.696 --> 01:54:23.822
What is it?

1441
01:54:26.909 --> 01:54:28.410
Our job isn't over.

1442
01:54:31.997 --> 01:54:34.041
Maybe I heard him wrong. George.

1443
01:54:35.918 --> 01:54:37.336
You heard him right.

1444
01:54:39.087 --> 01:54:40.088
Your vision...

1445
01:54:43.050 --> 01:54:44.676
it was real.

1446
01:54:45.511 --> 01:54:46.845
He did his part.

1447
01:54:47.679 --> 01:54:49.806
We have to do ours.

1448
01:55:00.025 --> 01:55:01.860
<i>The fight is on.</i>

1449
01:55:01.944 --> 01:55:04.655
<i>Three years after he lost
to Evander Holyfield.</i>

1450
01:55:04.738 --> 01:55:07.449
<i>Big George Foreman.
who's now 45 years old.</i>

1451
01:55:07.533 --> 01:55:10.661
<i>has fought his way back to a title fight.</i>

1452
01:55:10.744 --> 01:55:13.330
<i>But he might wanna be careful
what he wishes for.</i>

1453
01:55:13.413 --> 01:55:17.209
<i>Michael Moorer. the newly-minted
heavyweight champion of the world.</i>

1454
01:55:17.292 --> 01:55:19.711
<i>A new champion. in his prime.</i>

1455
01:55:19.795 --> 01:55:23.465
<i>with speed. power. and a fluid arsenal.</i>

1456
01:55:24.842 --> 01:55:28.637
<i>Thirty of Moorer's 35 wins
have come by knockout.</i>

1457
01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:30.764
<i>He is very difficult to fight.</i>

1458
01:55:31.431 --> 01:55:34.268
<i>The first southpaw champion
in heavyweight history.</i>

1459
01:55:34.351 --> 01:55:36.979
<i>and he boasts a win
over Evander Holyfield.</i>

1460
01:55:37.062 --> 01:55:39.022
<i>who battered Big George.</i>

1461
01:55:39.106 --> 01:55:43.443
<i>There has never been
a 45-year-old heavyweight champion.</i>

1462
01:55:43.527 --> 01:55:46.655
<i>The risk here
to George Foreman isn't losing.</i>

1463
01:55:46.738 --> 01:55:48.031
<i>it's surviving.</i>

1464
01:55:48.115 --> 01:55:49.408
How can you beat that man?

1465
01:56:28.238 --> 01:56:29.740
Get out of the pocket.

1466
01:56:33.744 --> 01:56:34.578
Come on. now.

1467
01:56:38.415 --> 01:56:40.834
Looks like the myth
of George Foreman's power

1468
01:56:40.918 --> 01:56:43.253
is being exposed by Moorer so far.

1469
01:56:44.796 --> 01:56:46.215
Come on. son. What are you doing?

1470
01:56:46.298 --> 01:56:48.300
Solid right hand by Moorer.

1471
01:56:48.383 --> 01:56:51.386
<i>Foreman's taking a beating.
way behind on every scorecard.</i>

1472
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:53.680
<i>Every time George lands
something significant.</i>

1473
01:56:53.764 --> 01:56:56.517
<i>Moorer comes back
with two or three punches of his own.</i>

1474
01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:00.020
<i>He's having a difficult time
with the younger and faster fighter.</i>

1475
01:57:00.103 --> 01:57:01.355
<i>George has no timing.</i>

1476
01:57:01.438 --> 01:57:05.234
<i>He's very slow and sluggish.
I thought he'd be sharper than this.</i>

1477
01:57:08.529 --> 01:57:10.948
Moorer's cutting up George like a turkey.

1478
01:57:13.534 --> 01:57:14.743
Our guy's got nothing left.

1479
01:57:14.826 --> 01:57:16.787
Easy. Easy.

1480
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:19.331
Foreman's left eye beginning to close.

1481
01:57:19.414 --> 01:57:21.750
Well. now he just looks so tired. Jim.

1482
01:57:23.418 --> 01:57:25.212
He deserves all the credit in the world.

1483
01:57:25.295 --> 01:57:28.924
but he is a 45-year-old man
in a young man's game.

1484
01:57:35.055 --> 01:57:38.725
Uppercut by Moorer.
blasted Foreman's chin backward.

1485
01:57:42.479 --> 01:57:44.523
Oh. God. Protect him.

1486
01:57:58.871 --> 01:58:01.123
<i>I've been fighting all my life.</i>

1487
01:58:04.835 --> 01:58:06.503
<i>For a long time.</i>

1488
01:58:06.587 --> 01:58:09.173
<i>I fought
because I felt hated by the world.</i>

1489
01:58:11.341 --> 01:58:13.051
Poor-man!

1490
01:58:20.184 --> 01:58:22.269
<i>I call it the "Ghetto Whopper."</i>

1491
01:58:22.352 --> 01:58:24.938
<i>I will fight George Foreman
anywhere. any time.</i>

1492
01:58:37.576 --> 01:58:38.994
<i>But I've changed.</i>

1493
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:45.083
Nine rounds against the best in the world.

1494
01:58:45.167 --> 01:58:48.086
There's no shame. son. No shame.

1495
01:58:48.170 --> 01:58:50.005
He's all right. He's all right.

1496
01:58:54.301 --> 01:58:55.427
You okay?

1497
01:59:10.776 --> 01:59:12.611
Come on. George. Come on.

1498
01:59:21.662 --> 01:59:24.915
<i>I had to get knocked down
all the way to the bottom</i>

1499
01:59:24.998 --> 01:59:26.083
<i>to finally see...</i>

1500
01:59:29.294 --> 01:59:33.131
<i>everything I was searching for
was already there.</i>

1501
01:59:44.893 --> 01:59:45.936
<i>And with that...</i>

1502
01:59:47.729 --> 01:59:50.566
<i>you can do the impossible.</i>

1503
01:59:56.530 --> 01:59:58.532
Down goes Moorer on a right hand!

1504
01:59:58.615 --> 02:00:01.410
An unbelievably close-in. right-hand shot.

1505
02:00:04.913 --> 02:00:07.833
-I don't believe it.
-It happened!

1506
02:00:07.916 --> 02:00:10.169
Five. Six.

1507
02:00:10.252 --> 02:00:12.754
-Stay down. Stay down.
<i>-Seven.</i>

1508
02:00:12.838 --> 02:00:16.675
Eight. Nine. Ten.

1509
02:00:17.926 --> 02:00:19.344
It happened!

1510
02:00:20.762 --> 02:00:24.099
George Foreman is
the new heavyweight champ of the world.

1511
02:00:33.066 --> 02:00:35.569
The boxer turned preacher
is down on his knees.

1512
02:00:35.652 --> 02:00:39.072
not in defeat.
but in victory and thanksgiving.

1513
02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:56.089
Thank you.

1514
02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.050
No. thank you.

1515
02:00:59.259 --> 02:01:01.220
You're the heavyweight champion
of the world.

1516
02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:04.097
-We did it.
-We did it.

1517
02:01:04.181 --> 02:01:05.807
-We did it.
-We did it.

1518
02:01:10.938 --> 02:01:11.939
We did it.

1519
02:01:23.617 --> 02:01:29.331
I have never seen anything like this
in the 25 years of my career. Gil.

1520
02:01:29.414 --> 02:01:34.419
Oldest heavyweight champion
in the world ever. George Foreman.
