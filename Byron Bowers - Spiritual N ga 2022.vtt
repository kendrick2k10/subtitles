Make America Great Again.

174
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.184
and for short they call it MAGA

175
00:08:33.267 --> 00:08:34.977
and I was like oh shit
they think they're slick.

176
00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:38.939
I see what they did.
they shortened the word.

177
00:08:39.023 --> 00:08:41.359
trying to make it sound cool.
I know this trick.

178
00:08:41.442 --> 00:08:42.860
we did the same thing
for the word n****

179
00:08:43.819 --> 00:08:45.863
I don't know if you know
n**** was a longer word.

180
00:08:46.739 --> 00:08:50.076
[inaudible] 400 years of getting
ground down with slavery

181
00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:52.411
and shit and they went
on a spiritual journey.

182
00:08:52.495 --> 00:08:53.537
then it got shortened

183
00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:55.164
and it became cool.
now everybody say shit.

184
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:57.333
They try to do that with MAGA.

185
00:08:57.416 --> 00:08:59.168
I'm like no MAGA.
you can't do that.

186
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:00.628
You ain't slick.
you gotta earn that shit.

187
00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:02.671
MAGA gotta go through
his journey.

188
00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:04.173
That's why I think we should put
a hard R

189
00:09:04.256 --> 00:09:05.257
on the end of that bitch.

190
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:08.135
[laughs]

191
00:09:08.219 --> 00:09:10.388
And call on that from now on
with a country accent

192
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:12.473
like these fucking MAGAR's
out here.

193
00:09:12.556 --> 00:09:14.141
[laughs]

194
00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:15.768
Wearing their MAGA hats.

195
00:09:17.228 --> 00:09:18.729
Always complaining about shit.

196
00:09:18.813 --> 00:09:21.148
Why don't they go back to where
the fuck they came from.

197
00:09:21.774 --> 00:09:23.067
Fucking MAGAR's.

198
00:09:26.404 --> 00:09:28.364
See somebody already laughed.
what are you MAGA lovers

199
00:09:28.447 --> 00:09:29.448
or something?

200
00:09:30.074 --> 00:09:32.201
Well I don't give a fuck.
put on your MAGAR hat

201
00:09:32.284 --> 00:09:35.413
and go back to Forsyth County
where the fuck you came from.

202
00:09:35.496 --> 00:09:41.085
[laughs]

203
00:09:41.168 --> 00:09:42.795
I ain't tripping.
I let 'em live.

204
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:45.840
We're all on journeys.
you know what I mean?

205
00:09:47.216 --> 00:09:49.260
Shit. I don't know what the fuck
I was doing when I started.

206
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.761
Some of y'all know
when I started.

207
00:09:50.845 --> 00:09:52.179
I didn't know what
the fuck I was doing.

208
00:09:52.263 --> 00:09:54.515
Even before then.
man I sold crack

209
00:09:54.682 --> 00:09:56.308
and went to college. I didn't
know what the fuck.

210
00:09:56.392 --> 00:09:58.352
[laughs]

211
00:09:58.436 --> 00:09:59.979
I was just trying
to figure shit out.

212
00:10:02.648 --> 00:10:06.152
Did stand up. wasn't even good
at it. I was going quit.

213
00:10:06.694 --> 00:10:08.279
That was another thing
I was gonna quit.

214
00:10:09.238 --> 00:10:11.198
Then the universe spoke to me.
my gut told me

215
00:10:11.282 --> 00:10:13.659
that if I did this it would
take me to the promised land.

216
00:10:14.577 --> 00:10:15.578
and I was like okay.

217
00:10:15.786 --> 00:10:18.539
And I rolled with that shit
and I told my home boy

218
00:10:18.622 --> 00:10:20.291
like man I'm hoping to do
this comedy shit.

219
00:10:20.833 --> 00:10:23.669
I quit my job. and he was
like "Nick are you crazy?"

220
00:10:24.712 --> 00:10:27.381
Are you gonna quit your job
and follow your gut?

221
00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:31.010
And I was like yeah.
let me stay in your basement.

222
00:10:31.093 --> 00:10:36.307
[laughs]

223
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.767
Pack up a prelude.

224
00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:41.354
some of y'all remember
that prelude

225
00:10:41.437 --> 00:10:43.314
didn't have a front [inaudible]
on that mother fucker.

226
00:10:46.359 --> 00:10:48.235
I drove that shit all the way
to California

227
00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:49.528
with the engine light on.

228
00:10:52.323 --> 00:10:54.992
Went from a red state
to a blue state.

229
00:10:56.202 --> 00:10:57.536
different values.

230
00:10:59.372 --> 00:11:00.915
You know in the land
of you know.

231
00:11:01.123 --> 00:11:02.208
abortions are legal.

232
00:11:03.042 --> 00:11:05.753
In LA plastic straws are legal.

233
00:11:05.836 --> 00:11:08.714
[laughs]

234
00:11:08.798 --> 00:11:11.092
Use a plastic straw.
people make you feel guilty.

235
00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:12.927
like you're killing a soul.

236
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.137
I'm like damn they do
that for abortions in a lounge.

237
00:11:15.221 --> 00:11:18.307
[laughs]

238
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:19.892
The waiter slipped me
a plastic straw

239
00:11:19.975 --> 00:11:21.227
like it was an eight ball
of cocaine.

240
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.145
He was like here you go.
keep this shit down right here.

241
00:11:23.229 --> 00:11:25.272
[laughs]

242
00:11:25.356 --> 00:11:27.316
If you get caught you didn't get
that shit from me.

243
00:11:29.443 --> 00:11:31.153
I put the straw in a glass.
everybody looking

244
00:11:31.237 --> 00:11:33.072
"you can't use that.
you gotta use a paper straw."

245
00:11:33.155 --> 00:11:34.156
I was like "What?"

246
00:11:35.074 --> 00:11:36.742
A paper straw. ugh.

247
00:11:37.618 --> 00:11:38.619
I'm gonna sip it.

248
00:11:38.703 --> 00:11:39.995
Why the fuck would I use
a paper straw?

249
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:43.708
It was. ugh. use the paper straw
for that shit to unravel

250
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:46.711
in the glass. the hole closes.

251
00:11:46.794 --> 00:11:47.795
It tastes like chemicals.

252
00:11:47.878 --> 00:11:49.630
I don't know what the fuck
that shit's made of.

253
00:11:50.172 --> 00:11:51.632
I'd rather drink out
of cigarette

254
00:11:51.716 --> 00:11:52.717
than a paper straw.

255
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.677
[laughs]

256
00:11:56.303 --> 00:11:58.139
Why the fuck are we using
paper straws anyway?

257
00:11:58.222 --> 00:11:59.557
They was like
cause a sea turtle died.

258
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.225
I'm like get the fuck
out of here.

259
00:12:02.727 --> 00:12:03.894
A turtle died

260
00:12:03.978 --> 00:12:07.064
and now fucking plastic straws
are illegal.

261
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:08.983
That's when I realized
they don't give a fuck

262
00:12:09.066 --> 00:12:10.067
about human beings.

263
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:12.194
We're still arguing over
gun laws and one turtle died.

264
00:12:12.278 --> 00:12:14.238
and they shut that shit down.

265
00:12:15.239 --> 00:12:17.491
I'm like man. these turtles
got a good ass lawyer.

266
00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:20.911
They tried to give my cousin
ten years for a bag of weed.

267
00:12:20.995 --> 00:12:23.330
I'm like n**** you should
have had that sea turtle lawyer.

268
00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:27.209
you would be free right now.

269
00:12:29.295 --> 00:12:30.755
I was mad as fuck man.

270
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.548
I was like I wish
I would see a sea turtle.

271
00:12:32.631 --> 00:12:34.216
I'd choke the shit out
of sea turtles.

272
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:38.012
I'd choke the... I'd put
that mother fucker on his back

273
00:12:38.095 --> 00:12:40.097
and just let that mother fucker
matrix like that

274
00:12:40.681 --> 00:12:43.392
and then kick his legs. boom
and spin him in a circle

275
00:12:43.476 --> 00:12:46.187
and dance around them fish like
yeah you are in jail now. bitch.

276
00:12:49.648 --> 00:12:51.025
Then I looked in the mirror

277
00:12:52.485 --> 00:12:54.236
and realized I was part
of the problem.

278
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.282
It's my fault turtles
are here running around free.

279
00:12:58.783 --> 00:13:02.411
[laughs]

280
00:13:02.495 --> 00:13:04.830
You know what? I was snorkeling
with sea turtles.

281
00:13:05.539 --> 00:13:07.958
I spent 40 minutes with them
n**** out in the ocean.

282
00:13:09.043 --> 00:13:10.378
watching them do
sea turtle shit.

283
00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:12.046
Have you ever seen them
out there in the ocean?

284
00:13:12.213 --> 00:13:15.132
Their little fins like hovering
around that in the water.

285
00:13:15.383 --> 00:13:16.676
They got that look in their eye

286
00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:19.011
like they got a head full
of free style battle raps.

287
00:13:19.095 --> 00:13:20.513
[laughs]

288
00:13:20.596 --> 00:13:23.015
And they just want a free style
battle rap and shit.

289
00:13:23.307 --> 00:13:24.392
And they'll be going up to shit

290
00:13:24.475 --> 00:13:26.268
like you want some of this
jellyfish?

291
00:13:26.352 --> 00:13:27.645
[laughs]

292
00:13:27.728 --> 00:13:29.730
I get in your ass sea-grass.

293
00:13:30.398 --> 00:13:32.441
and they drop shits
in the middle of the ocean.

294
00:13:32.525 --> 00:13:33.526
Fly.

295
00:13:34.068 --> 00:13:35.945
Like hot mixed tape records.

296
00:13:36.862 --> 00:13:38.948
just sitting on there.
like whoop.

297
00:13:40.074 --> 00:13:42.034
And I followed it around
for 40 minutes

298
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.204
watching it. learning from it.

299
00:13:45.746 --> 00:13:48.124
showing it all this love.
which is power spiritually.

300
00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:50.668
Power to change laws
and it's fucked up.

301
00:13:50.751 --> 00:13:52.420
cause we've got a homeless
problem in LA.

302
00:13:52.503 --> 00:13:54.880
and I've never spent 40 minutes
with a homeless person.

303
00:13:54.964 --> 00:13:57.925
All they do is sea turtle shit.
they freestyle battle rap.

304
00:13:58.008 --> 00:14:05.016
[laughs]

305
00:14:06.017 --> 00:14:07.768
And drop shits on the sidewalk.

306
00:14:10.438 --> 00:14:11.939
like hot mix tape records.

307
00:14:12.023 --> 00:14:13.941
New shit. boom. boom. boom.

308
00:14:14.942 --> 00:14:17.319
[inaudible]

309
00:14:21.532 --> 00:14:23.200
You're not even supposed
to touch sea turtles.

310
00:14:23.284 --> 00:14:24.285
Did you know that?

311
00:14:24.827 --> 00:14:26.037
You're not supposed
to touch 'em.

312
00:14:26.203 --> 00:14:27.288
It's bad for the eco system.

313
00:14:27.371 --> 00:14:29.832
They got germs and we got germs
and if you touch 'em.

314
00:14:29.915 --> 00:14:31.584
you can cross contaminate.
that's what they told me

315
00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:32.668
before I got in the ocean.

316
00:14:33.252 --> 00:14:34.879
I remember looking
that sea turtle in the eye

317
00:14:34.962 --> 00:14:35.963
and I was like "hey n****.

318
00:14:36.797 --> 00:14:38.758
from one endangered species
to the next.

319
00:14:39.175 --> 00:14:43.346
pow. whatever you got. I got.

320
00:14:44.221 --> 00:14:46.557
Ask me if I've touched
a homeless person before. nope.

321
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.476
[laughs]

322
00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:49.894
You're not related to one.

323
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:52.271
I didn't even get him
a father's day card.

324
00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:57.943
[laughs]

325
00:14:58.027 --> 00:14:59.987
They don't make 'em for mentally
ill people that's why.

326
00:15:00.821 --> 00:15:02.406
I've read every father's day
card out.

327
00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.908
there like.
world's greatest dad.

328
00:15:03.991 --> 00:15:06.077
and because of you my life
turned out like this.

329
00:15:06.202 --> 00:15:08.454
But there's not a father's day
card out there that says

330
00:15:08.537 --> 00:15:13.042
you hear every voice
in the world except mine.

331
00:15:15.252 --> 00:15:16.962
Happy father's day papa.

332
00:15:17.046 --> 00:15:24.053
[laughs]

333
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:27.264
My dad got schizophrenia.
y'all know what that is?

334
00:15:28.391 --> 00:15:30.768
That's good cause before nobody
would know what it is.

335
00:15:31.477 --> 00:15:33.104
I'm glad to see we're
making improvements

336
00:15:33.187 --> 00:15:34.897
in the mental health
conversation.

337
00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:36.440
you know.

338
00:15:37.358 --> 00:15:38.859
You know the hardest part
about schizophrenia?

339
00:15:38.943 --> 00:15:39.985
Spelling schizophrenia.

340
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:41.654
[laughs]

341
00:15:41.737 --> 00:15:43.489
You look crazy as fuck
trying to spell that shit

342
00:15:43.572 --> 00:15:44.824
in your head.
you know what I mean.

343
00:15:47.493 --> 00:15:50.079
It's tough.
a tough word to spell.

344
00:15:50.663 --> 00:15:52.081
I won't be embarrassed about it

345
00:15:52.623 --> 00:15:54.709
like I wanted to bring awareness
to it a long time ago

346
00:15:54.792 --> 00:15:57.628
but it's hard to bring awareness
to some shit you can't spell.

347
00:15:57.837 --> 00:15:59.880
[laughs]

348
00:15:59.964 --> 00:16:01.006
I'd be frustrated.

349
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.925
People would be like hey man
what's wrong with your dad?

350
00:16:03.008 --> 00:16:05.219
I'd be like. man. man.
I wish this n**** had AIDS.

351
00:16:05.302 --> 00:16:06.595
it would be so much easier.

352
00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:09.515
[laughs]

353
00:16:09.598 --> 00:16:11.642
I tell you my dad got AIDS.
it's just so easy to explain.

354
00:16:11.726 --> 00:16:13.269
you'll be like your dad was
having fun.

355
00:16:14.186 --> 00:16:15.855
schizophrenia that's
a whole different ball game.

356
00:16:15.938 --> 00:16:17.398
You can't even argue
with a schizophrenic

357
00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:18.941
without looking crazy yourself.

358
00:16:20.901 --> 00:16:23.029
Like my dad would do shit.
he was saying shit about me

359
00:16:23.112 --> 00:16:25.531
that wasn't true and I'm trying
to defend myself

360
00:16:25.614 --> 00:16:27.992
but the person that he told
that shit don't even exist.

361
00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:29.326
so I look crazy.

362
00:16:31.954 --> 00:16:32.955
Fucked up.

363
00:16:35.249 --> 00:16:36.667
We all know how to deal
with mental health

364
00:16:36.751 --> 00:16:37.752
as a community.

365
00:16:38.461 --> 00:16:39.503
We don't trust the health care.

366
00:16:39.587 --> 00:16:41.255
we are too broke we don't trust
the mother fuckers

367
00:16:41.338 --> 00:16:42.339
they send us to.

368
00:16:43.215 --> 00:16:45.468
So we end up going where?
To the church.

369
00:16:46.218 --> 00:16:47.803
they don't know what the fuck
to do.

370
00:16:48.637 --> 00:16:50.556
I'll be like hey man. something
wrong with my dad's head.

371
00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:51.640
he got mental issues.

372
00:16:51.724 --> 00:16:53.267
They'd be like well.
I'm gonna pray for him.

373
00:16:53.351 --> 00:16:54.518
oh. okay. you do that.

374
00:16:55.644 --> 00:16:58.481
That's what we tried to do
and n**** shit got worse.

375
00:16:58.606 --> 00:17:04.862
[laughs]

376
00:17:04.945 --> 00:17:06.155
We lean on the church too much.

377
00:17:06.238 --> 00:17:08.074
well did you try to take
your dad to church n****?

378
00:17:08.157 --> 00:17:11.494
You want me to tell the n****
who had delusions

379
00:17:11.577 --> 00:17:13.120
about shit that ain't real

380
00:17:13.704 --> 00:17:16.916
to a place where n**** worship
some shit...

381
00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:19.877
[laughs]

382
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.295
...that might not be real.

383
00:17:21.379 --> 00:17:27.677
[laughs]

384
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.970
You know how crazy
that's gonna look to my dad?

385
00:17:32.682 --> 00:17:34.642
This n**** walking
in church and shit.

386
00:17:35.643 --> 00:17:37.603
he's seeing n**** whooping
and hollering to heaven

387
00:17:37.687 --> 00:17:41.107
and the holy ghost and fucking
passing out and shit.

388
00:17:42.108 --> 00:17:44.777
Jesus hanging up
on the mother fucking cross.

389
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.570
and it's a white Jesus at that.

390
00:17:48.572 --> 00:17:50.491
This n**** hanging there.
and everyone whooping

391
00:17:50.574 --> 00:17:52.201
and hollering and praising.
crying and shit.

392
00:17:52.284 --> 00:17:55.204
My dad gonna be like
god what the hell going on here?

393
00:17:56.163 --> 00:17:58.332
God. damn times have changed.

394
00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:00.960
Are we lynching
white people now?

395
00:18:01.043 --> 00:18:02.837
Why is a white man up there
on that thing?

396
00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.921
[laughs]

397
00:18:04.004 --> 00:18:05.840
Yeah again what you all gonna
use rope?

398
00:18:05.923 --> 00:18:07.717
Y'all just nailed the n****
up there like that?

399
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.343
[laughs]

400
00:18:09.427 --> 00:18:11.262
Y'all mother fuckers crazy
in here.

401
00:18:11.345 --> 00:18:13.514
I'm about to get the hell out
of here.

402
00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:16.183
I'll take some of this wine
though before I leave.

403
00:18:16.267 --> 00:18:19.979
[laughs]

404
00:18:27.028 --> 00:18:28.112
The thing is for some...

405
00:18:28.195 --> 00:18:30.031
you know. if my dad knew
something was wrong

406
00:18:30.114 --> 00:18:31.157
whether he would say something.

407
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.659
Like hey son. there's something
wrong with my mind.

408
00:18:33.784 --> 00:18:35.327
and some time I'm gonna act
a little erratic

409
00:18:35.411 --> 00:18:37.079
so watch out for me.

410
00:18:37.496 --> 00:18:39.957
But he didn't. he thought
everybody else was crazy

411
00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:42.043
and trying to convince him
he was crazy

412
00:18:42.126 --> 00:18:43.961
which made him not trust people
even more.

413
00:18:45.629 --> 00:18:47.757
And the part is
we are all kind of crazy.

414
00:18:49.216 --> 00:18:51.135
we are. we just don't admit
shit.

415
00:18:51.886 --> 00:18:53.512
That's the crazy part.
we don't admit shit.

416
00:18:53.596 --> 00:18:56.682
we don't admit when we're sad.
we don't admit to a lot of shit.

417
00:18:58.642 --> 00:19:00.436
and they don't teach us
this shit in school.

418
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:04.065
They teach us all types of shit.
except shit we really need

419
00:19:04.148 --> 00:19:06.484
to use every day
like how to deal with anxiety.

420
00:19:07.026 --> 00:19:09.570
how to deal with depression.
how to deal with sadness.

421
00:19:10.237 --> 00:19:11.947
Nobody told us
how to masturbate.

422
00:19:12.031 --> 00:19:15.493
[laughs]

423
00:19:15.576 --> 00:19:16.577
They didn't!

424
00:19:18.287 --> 00:19:20.456
We had to go on a journey
to learn how to be masters.

425
00:19:20.539 --> 00:19:22.500
We was regular [inaudible]
there first.

426
00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:26.962
And it's weird cause
the first time my dick got hard.

427
00:19:27.046 --> 00:19:28.047
I was in class.

428
00:19:29.006 --> 00:19:30.758
I didn't know what to do.
I started sweating.

429
00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:32.677
I was panicked. I had anxiety.

430
00:19:32.802 --> 00:19:35.513
I felt something I never felt
before and I panicked.

431
00:19:35.596 --> 00:19:37.515
I just took my book and put it
in my lap.

432
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.017
and that was the first time
I took all my emotions

433
00:19:40.893 --> 00:19:41.894
and pushed them down.

434
00:19:41.977 --> 00:19:44.021
[laughs]

435
00:19:45.523 --> 00:19:47.066
They don't teach us that man.

436
00:19:49.026 --> 00:19:51.237
You start off. you go harming.
we're going home.

437
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.321
I don't know what to do.

438
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.031
I was nervous.

439
00:19:54.699 --> 00:19:56.283
my body was feeling different.

440
00:19:56.534 --> 00:19:58.619
I took my mama's sofa cushion.
folded it in half.

441
00:19:58.703 --> 00:19:59.704
and put my dick in it.

442
00:19:59.787 --> 00:20:03.165
[laughs]

443
00:20:03.249 --> 00:20:05.668
Thinking that would help but
I just ended up with rub burn.

444
00:20:09.338 --> 00:20:10.756
I'm on that journey.
you know what I mean?

445
00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.049
It's just a bater mistake.

446
00:20:12.341 --> 00:20:13.801
I'm trying to figure shit out.

447
00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.430
I'm trying to like use Vaseline.
I'm like man it's too thick.

448
00:20:17.513 --> 00:20:19.181
You know what I mean.
I'm using lotion.

449
00:20:19.265 --> 00:20:21.600
this too [inaudible].
a conditioner. it's too oily.

450
00:20:21.684 --> 00:20:23.185
I'm just trying to work through
some shit.

451
00:20:23.269 --> 00:20:25.563
[laughs]

452
00:20:25.646 --> 00:20:27.398
Then I'm in my 20's.
I'm using my hand.

453
00:20:27.481 --> 00:20:29.483
and I'm like man do I like it
this way.

454
00:20:29.567 --> 00:20:30.860
or do I like it this way.

455
00:20:30.943 --> 00:20:32.611
or do I wanna rub it
like a genie lamp?

456
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.117
By the time I'm 35.
I'm a master at this shit.

457
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.577
I'm hitting myself
from the back.

458
00:20:39.702 --> 00:20:44.165
I'm like boop. boop.
bap. bap. bap. bap. bap.

459
00:20:44.248 --> 00:20:45.791
[laughs]

460
00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:47.585
I'm a master now.
you know what I mean?

461
00:20:47.668 --> 00:20:54.675
[laughs]

462
00:20:57.053 --> 00:20:59.430
This chick told me
her grandmother told her

463
00:20:59.513 --> 00:21:01.307
you gotta learn
how to please yourself.

464
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.643
That way you can teach a man
how to please you.

465
00:21:04.727 --> 00:21:07.313
That's a grandmother.
a woman being vulnerable

466
00:21:07.396 --> 00:21:09.357
to another woman.
to teach them the game.

467
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.025
My grandfather couldn't do
that shit.

468
00:21:12.193 --> 00:21:14.236
He's old school man.
he couldn't be vulnerable enough

469
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.530
to tell his grandboys
how to please themselves.

470
00:21:16.614 --> 00:21:17.656
He tried to trick us.

471
00:21:18.741 --> 00:21:19.992
He was like look at you
little n****

472
00:21:20.076 --> 00:21:21.452
with your little dirty ass
dicks.

473
00:21:21.535 --> 00:21:24.413
[laughs]

474
00:21:24.497 --> 00:21:26.540
Ain't no girl gonna let you
put their dirty ass shit

475
00:21:26.624 --> 00:21:27.625
in their. ugh.

476
00:21:28.959 --> 00:21:30.378
You gotta clean that shit.

477
00:21:31.128 --> 00:21:33.506
Well how do you.
how do you clean it grandad?

478
00:21:33.589 --> 00:21:36.258
Well this is what you do look.
don't use no rags.

479
00:21:36.342 --> 00:21:38.052
you take a bunch of soap.
put that shit in your hand

480
00:21:38.135 --> 00:21:40.388
and lather it up real good
and you clean that shit

481
00:21:40.471 --> 00:21:41.764
till you finish.

482
00:21:41.847 --> 00:21:45.184
[laughs]

483
00:21:45.267 --> 00:21:46.769
Grandad.
how do you know you've finished?

484
00:21:46.852 --> 00:21:48.020
Well he couldn't even
be vulnerable.

485
00:21:48.104 --> 00:21:51.399
he was like oh.
oh you will know.

486
00:21:51.482 --> 00:21:52.608
He walked off.

487
00:21:52.692 --> 00:21:54.777
[laughs]

488
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.861
And died.

489
00:21:55.945 --> 00:22:01.617
those was his last words
to his grandsons!

490
00:22:01.701 --> 00:22:04.245
[laughs]

491
00:22:07.456 --> 00:22:09.834
You ask a girl how she learns
how to masturbate.

492
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.379
it's the most simple complicated
shit in the world.

493
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.840
Asked a chick when
the first time you came?

494
00:22:15.923 --> 00:22:16.966
How did it happen?

495
00:22:17.258 --> 00:22:19.844
She was like oh I was
in the tub man on my back

496
00:22:19.969 --> 00:22:21.262
and my legs were in the air

497
00:22:21.345 --> 00:22:23.806
and the faucet well it was
hitting my clit.

498
00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:26.225
N****. when was the last time

499
00:22:27.977 --> 00:22:30.479
as a man you was in the tub
on your back

500
00:22:31.772 --> 00:22:34.859
with your legs in the air
letting the water cascade

501
00:22:35.276 --> 00:22:36.277
on your dick?

502
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.862
[laughs]

503
00:22:37.945 --> 00:22:40.906
Never! [inaudible]

504
00:22:42.783 --> 00:22:45.327
Then she said she took water.

505
00:22:45.411 --> 00:22:46.912
threw it all
on the bathroom floor.

506
00:22:46.996 --> 00:22:48.330
all on her little ass tiles

507
00:22:48.414 --> 00:22:50.666
and she was rubbing her clit
on the tiles like a seal.

508
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.627
[imitates seal]

509
00:22:53.711 --> 00:22:55.588
and she just started
cranking them cums out

510
00:22:55.671 --> 00:22:57.965
like that and I was like
oh. shit.

511
00:22:58.758 --> 00:23:00.760
This gonna be hard as fuck
to make you cum.

512
00:23:04.305 --> 00:23:06.015
She was like you can
eat my pussy.

513
00:23:06.098 --> 00:23:08.225
I was like oh I ain't
no bathroom floor pussy.

514
00:23:14.857 --> 00:23:16.692
That's how you get
athlete foot tongue.

515
00:23:16.776 --> 00:23:23.783
[laughs]

516
00:23:29.205 --> 00:23:30.206
Shit!

517
00:23:35.211 --> 00:23:37.046
What I'm saying is that they
just don't teach us this

518
00:23:37.129 --> 00:23:38.130
in school.

519
00:23:39.465 --> 00:23:41.258
Like when was the last time
you used

520
00:23:41.342 --> 00:23:42.843
fucking Pythagorean theorem.

521
00:23:42.968 --> 00:23:44.345
[laughs]

522
00:23:44.428 --> 00:23:45.429
Exactly!

523
00:23:46.472 --> 00:23:47.932
But I bet you jacked off
this week.

524
00:23:48.015 --> 00:23:49.892
[laughs]

525
00:23:49.975 --> 00:23:51.811
And I bet you were sad
when you finished.

526
00:23:51.894 --> 00:23:58.901
[laughs]

527
00:24:01.237 --> 00:24:03.656
I'm learning how to deal
with my sadness the older I get.

528
00:24:04.699 --> 00:24:06.701
Cause I've realized that life
is full of ups and down.

529
00:24:07.368 --> 00:24:10.454
Life is full of ups and down.
it's a cycle to it

530
00:24:10.538 --> 00:24:13.499
and we enjoy the ups.
we gotta enjoy the downs.

531
00:24:14.458 --> 00:24:16.293
We're never taught
how to enjoy the downs.

532
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.379
Before when I would get sad.
my home boy called.

533
00:24:18.462 --> 00:24:19.547
hey n**** you wanna hang out?

534
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.841
And I go hang out with him.
make him sad.

535
00:24:21.924 --> 00:24:24.301
[laughs]

536
00:24:24.385 --> 00:24:26.429
Now when he call. nah n****
I'm gonna stay at the house

537
00:24:26.512 --> 00:24:27.513
and mope.

538
00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.267
and it's okay to be at the house
by yourself and moping.

539
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.686
and don't shower
and really let yourself go.

540
00:24:33.769 --> 00:24:36.105
where the fucked up ass boxers
and one sock

541
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:39.442
and just walk around the house.
and cry.

542
00:24:39.525 --> 00:24:40.526
You know what I mean?

543
00:24:40.609 --> 00:24:42.111
That's something dudes.
we don't do enough of.

544
00:24:42.194 --> 00:24:45.239
Just have a real snotty ass cry
and just wipe your shit

545
00:24:45.322 --> 00:24:46.991
with your whole forearm.
you know what I mean?

546
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.954
Really feel it. time is
different when you're sad.

547
00:24:52.038 --> 00:24:53.039
it slows up.

548
00:24:53.497 --> 00:24:57.877
And is there for a reason.
let you know something is wrong.

549
00:24:59.545 --> 00:25:00.963
And we deal with that shit.

550
00:25:02.757 --> 00:25:04.508
and we're quick to try
to get out of sadness.

551
00:25:04.592 --> 00:25:05.760
and just pop out of it
and go back.

552
00:25:05.843 --> 00:25:08.929
No we've gotta take baby steps
to get out of sadness.

553
00:25:09.013 --> 00:25:11.724
small successes till you get
your confidence back.

554
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.435
That's when I shave.

555
00:25:15.644 --> 00:25:18.814
burn sage.
clean clutter out of my closet.

556
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.486
Start to cut my fingernails.

557
00:25:25.363 --> 00:25:26.906
shave my balls.

558
00:25:26.989 --> 00:25:28.741
[laughs]

559
00:25:29.533 --> 00:25:32.203
Ain't nothing more present
than shaving your balls.

560
00:25:33.454 --> 00:25:35.081
You know what? You got a razor
in one hand.

561
00:25:35.164 --> 00:25:37.333
you've got the future mankind
in the other.

562
00:25:38.876 --> 00:25:41.379
you got your nutskin stretched
all the way out

563
00:25:42.505 --> 00:25:44.048
till they look like batwings.

564
00:25:44.131 --> 00:25:45.758
[laughs]

565
00:25:45.841 --> 00:25:47.009
Lot of dudes looking down

566
00:25:47.093 --> 00:25:49.553
cause they all don't wanna admit
that they shave their nuts.

567
00:25:50.721 --> 00:25:52.807
cause it's such a vulnerable
thing. you know what I mean?

568
00:25:53.724 --> 00:25:54.725
You know what I mean?

569
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.727
To shave your balls. you know
how vulnerable you gotta be

570
00:25:56.811 --> 00:25:57.895
to shave your balls.

571
00:25:58.104 --> 00:25:59.980
First off you ain't got shit
on on the bottom.

572
00:26:00.481 --> 00:26:01.482
Ain't shit on.

573
00:26:01.565 --> 00:26:03.693
you've got your leg hiked up
on the toilet like this.

574
00:26:04.485 --> 00:26:06.153
You've got a t-shirt on
for no reason

575
00:26:06.237 --> 00:26:07.738
but the shirt tucked
under your chin.

576
00:26:07.822 --> 00:26:10.408
[laughs]

577
00:26:10.491 --> 00:26:12.702
And you're just trying to go
at it. you know what I mean?

578
00:26:15.329 --> 00:26:17.498
And the nut shape shift.
did you know that Susan?

579
00:26:17.581 --> 00:26:19.959
The nuts change shape.

580
00:26:22.294 --> 00:26:25.089
If it's cold outside.
it's easy it's like shaving a U.

581
00:26:26.757 --> 00:26:27.883
But if it's hot outside.

582
00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:30.469
man that's like shaving
a fucking cursive W.

583
00:26:30.553 --> 00:26:32.346
[laughs]

584
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:36.392
You gotta deal with sadness

585
00:26:36.475 --> 00:26:37.685
cause if you don't deal
with sadness.

586
00:26:37.768 --> 00:26:39.687
it turns into depression.
That's a whole other beast.

587
00:26:40.855 --> 00:26:44.358
Depression is a whole beast
that gotta be dealt with.

588
00:26:46.652 --> 00:26:47.778
I remember I was working.

589
00:26:48.863 --> 00:26:50.740
like I had a different job
before this.

590
00:26:51.574 --> 00:26:53.826
and I remember I was passing
a playground.

591
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:55.870
It was kids on a playground.
they were just skipping.

592
00:26:55.953 --> 00:26:57.872
Yeah! Yeah!

593
00:26:57.955 --> 00:26:59.832
And they was having fun.
different races.

594
00:27:00.082 --> 00:27:02.293
different genders.
hanging out with one another.

595
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.003
They didn't give a fuck.
they would get dirty.

596
00:27:04.086 --> 00:27:06.464
get up. they'd wipe their shit
on their clothes.

597
00:27:07.506 --> 00:27:09.258
Looking in their eyes.
they were free.

598
00:27:10.134 --> 00:27:11.260
they were free.

599
00:27:12.345 --> 00:27:13.346
And I remember looking at them

600
00:27:13.429 --> 00:27:15.097
like damn what happened
to that feeling?

601
00:27:17.224 --> 00:27:19.685
I used to feel like that.
I know but what happened

602
00:27:20.061 --> 00:27:21.687
to that feeling of freedom?

603
00:27:23.939 --> 00:27:24.940
And I felt down.

604
00:27:26.609 --> 00:27:28.235
I got a cut on my forearm.

605
00:27:29.487 --> 00:27:31.781
cause I couldn't handle whatever
the fuck was going on.

606
00:27:32.073 --> 00:27:33.699
so I decided to cut my forearm

607
00:27:34.158 --> 00:27:35.159
and deal with the pain.

608
00:27:35.242 --> 00:27:36.827
cause I couldn't handle
the pain inside.

609
00:27:36.911 --> 00:27:38.537
so I created an external pain.

610
00:27:39.038 --> 00:27:40.748
Most people got multiple cuts
on their arm.

611
00:27:41.123 --> 00:27:43.250
I only got one.
cause I learned from that one.

612
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.295
cause I used the butter knife
and that was the wrong knife.

613
00:27:46.379 --> 00:27:50.424
[laughs]

614
00:27:50.508 --> 00:27:51.801
I'm like I'm too dumb
for this shit.

615
00:27:51.884 --> 00:27:53.636
I'm just sawing. I'm like
something ain't right.

616
00:27:55.012 --> 00:27:56.263
Something ain't right.

617
00:27:56.347 --> 00:27:57.515
[laughs]

618
00:28:01.602 --> 00:28:02.895
But I learned when I'm depressed

619
00:28:02.978 --> 00:28:04.313
I'm really thinking
about myself.

620
00:28:05.648 --> 00:28:07.191
I feel like there's no hope.

621
00:28:08.192 --> 00:28:10.945
I feel like I'm either being
punished by the universe

622
00:28:11.028 --> 00:28:13.656
or I'm in a hole
I can't get out of.

623
00:28:14.323 --> 00:28:16.492
but I realize I'm being selfish
at that moment.

624
00:28:17.284 --> 00:28:20.496
and I didn't realize that till
one time I was in that hole

625
00:28:20.996 --> 00:28:23.165
and was doing the holidays
and I fed the homeless people

626
00:28:23.249 --> 00:28:24.417
for the first time

627
00:28:24.667 --> 00:28:26.752
and I no longer was thinking
about myself.

628
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.881
I went from being like helpless
to helping others.

629
00:28:31.716 --> 00:28:33.175
and all that helplessness
went away

630
00:28:33.259 --> 00:28:35.261
because I became a part
of this big collective.

631
00:28:36.762 --> 00:28:37.847
and that's my cheat code.

632
00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.057
If you're ever feeling down
like that. that's what you do.

633
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.727
Don't think
about your circumstance.

634
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:44.854
call somebody else.
give them a ride to the store.

635
00:28:44.937 --> 00:28:46.230
help an old lady
across the street.

636
00:28:46.313 --> 00:28:47.690
do whatever you gotta do.

637
00:28:49.108 --> 00:28:51.485
We all can be a part
of this big collective.

638
00:28:53.362 --> 00:28:55.865
cause if not depression can turn
into the worst thing.

639
00:28:55.948 --> 00:28:56.949
which is suicide.

640
00:28:57.074 --> 00:28:58.951
A lot of celebrities
kill themselves

641
00:28:59.035 --> 00:29:00.828
cause they spend so much time
being somebody else.

642
00:29:00.911 --> 00:29:02.455
They ain't dealt
with themselves.

643
00:29:05.541 --> 00:29:07.501
Every time I see a celebrity

644
00:29:07.585 --> 00:29:09.962
or somebody I think [inaudible]
killed themselves.

645
00:29:10.046 --> 00:29:11.088
I wanna know why.

646
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.466
cause I'm like man
if you're successful.

647
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:14.675
and you killed yourself.

648
00:29:14.759 --> 00:29:16.469
what the fuck am I going
to work every day for?

649
00:29:16.552 --> 00:29:18.137
[laughs]

650
00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:20.556
I can just end that shit
right now.

651
00:29:24.101 --> 00:29:26.354
And I wanna know why
for selfish reasons too.

652
00:29:26.437 --> 00:29:28.189
Like there was a lady worth
$400 million dollars

653
00:29:28.272 --> 00:29:30.358
and she hung herself.
I got mad as hell.

654
00:29:30.441 --> 00:29:31.817
[laughs]

655
00:29:31.901 --> 00:29:32.902
Do you know why?

656
00:29:32.985 --> 00:29:34.737
Cause that's how n****
in prison killed themselves.

657
00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.489
Poor people kill themselves
by hanging.

658
00:29:36.614 --> 00:29:38.115
that's why they take
the shoe strings out

659
00:29:38.199 --> 00:29:40.117
of prisoners shoes
so they can't hang themselves.

660
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:43.120
You're worth $400 million
dollars bitch. be creative.

661
00:29:43.204 --> 00:29:47.750
[laughs]

662
00:29:47.833 --> 00:29:51.962
Put on that squirrel suit
and just be out there like boom.

663
00:29:52.046 --> 00:29:53.506
hit them that way.
you know what I mean?

664
00:29:53.881 --> 00:29:55.383
[bell]
It's over. bitch.

665
00:30:08.604 --> 00:30:09.689
I was in San Francisco

666
00:30:09.772 --> 00:30:11.440
and in San Francisco they got
this bridge

667
00:30:11.524 --> 00:30:13.693
called the Golden Gate Bridge.
I don't know if you heard of it?

668
00:30:14.777 --> 00:30:16.487
But on this bridge
they've got phones.

669
00:30:17.655 --> 00:30:19.990
where if you're sad and you're
thinking about killing yourself.

670
00:30:20.074 --> 00:30:21.283
you can call
and talk to somebody.

671
00:30:21.826 --> 00:30:24.245
And them said and make them
wanna kill themselves.

672
00:30:24.328 --> 00:30:26.372
[laughs]

673
00:30:26.455 --> 00:30:28.124
It's called a suicide helpline.

674
00:30:28.207 --> 00:30:29.500
who the fuck is that helping?

675
00:30:30.376 --> 00:30:32.795
We need two n**** who are
proud to talk to each other.

676
00:30:33.629 --> 00:30:35.840
that's why I wanna create
a suicide hot line.

677
00:30:35.923 --> 00:30:39.427
fuck a helpline. a hot line.
that way if you're sad

678
00:30:39.719 --> 00:30:41.220
and you think
about killing yourself.

679
00:30:41.887 --> 00:30:43.514
you can call and talk
to somebody

680
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:45.349
who likes jacking off to people

681
00:30:45.433 --> 00:30:48.019
who say it and wanna kill
themselves.

682
00:30:51.063 --> 00:30:53.274
Think about it.
you calls 'em up. hello.

683
00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:55.234
yeah. I'm thinking
about killing myself.

684
00:30:55.317 --> 00:30:57.403
Oh shit hold on. zip.

685
00:30:57.486 --> 00:30:59.864
[noise]
Tell me about it.

686
00:30:59.947 --> 00:31:03.534
[laughs]

687
00:31:03.868 --> 00:31:06.829
Yeah. my job fired me.
I ain't got no money

688
00:31:06.912 --> 00:31:09.582
and my girl left. what the fuck
is that noise?

689
00:31:09.665 --> 00:31:11.500
Oh you're shuffling your papers.

690
00:31:12.585 --> 00:31:14.503
Keep going. I'm sorry.
I wrote in pencil.

691
00:31:14.587 --> 00:31:16.422
I'm just doing a lot
of erasing over here.

692
00:31:16.964 --> 00:31:18.299
Where you at right now?

693
00:31:18.382 --> 00:31:19.592
Oh I'm on this bridge.

694
00:31:19.675 --> 00:31:21.469
Oh shit. oh the bridge.

695
00:31:21.844 --> 00:31:23.637
What are you wearing
on that bridge?

696
00:31:24.555 --> 00:31:26.807
Nothing cause I want 'em
to be able to identify

697
00:31:26.891 --> 00:31:28.642
my cold wet body.

698
00:31:28.726 --> 00:31:31.228
Oh you're wet. huh.

699
00:31:31.604 --> 00:31:33.731
Oh shit I'm coming.

700
00:31:33.814 --> 00:31:35.066
No don't come for me.

701
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:37.193
Oh shit.

702
00:31:37.443 --> 00:31:39.820
What the fuck.
they hang up the phone.

703
00:31:39.904 --> 00:31:41.822
they ain't even thinking about
killing themselves no more.

704
00:31:41.906 --> 00:31:43.491
The other mother fucker
just came.

705
00:31:43.574 --> 00:31:45.534
I just killed two birds
with one stone.

706
00:31:47.078 --> 00:31:48.454
It's true
you can't kill yourself.

707
00:31:48.537 --> 00:31:49.914
after somebody just busted a nut

708
00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:51.791
for you thinking
about killing yourself.

709
00:31:52.708 --> 00:31:54.043
No. you gotta call somebody else

710
00:31:54.126 --> 00:31:55.544
and be like n****.
you ain't gonna believe

711
00:31:55.628 --> 00:31:56.796
what the fuck just happened
to me.

712
00:31:56.879 --> 00:32:00.508
[laughs]

713
00:32:00.591 --> 00:32:02.301
I just gave you
a reason to live.

714
00:32:03.594 --> 00:32:05.179
Now you got a story to tell.

715
00:32:16.023 --> 00:32:18.150
We gotta get better
at dealing with emotions man.

716
00:32:19.318 --> 00:32:21.320
Some people drugs
to cover up their emotions.

717
00:32:22.363 --> 00:32:24.198
Like I waited a long time
to do drugs.

718
00:32:24.824 --> 00:32:27.618
I was nervous if I tried drugs
I'd become addicted to 'em

719
00:32:28.202 --> 00:32:29.662
cause I've got addicts
in my family.

720
00:32:30.538 --> 00:32:32.498
My dad he had crack
for ten years.

721
00:32:33.332 --> 00:32:35.167
then I found out the reason
he was doing crack

722
00:32:35.251 --> 00:32:36.252
wasn't to get high.

723
00:32:37.253 --> 00:32:39.672
he had a mental illness that
he wasn't able to deal with.

724
00:32:40.256 --> 00:32:41.465
so he was trying to mask it.

725
00:32:41.966 --> 00:32:43.342
he was trying to hide that shit.

726
00:32:44.176 --> 00:32:46.554
because the church
didn't help him at all.

727
00:32:47.763 --> 00:32:49.098
And sometimes when the church
don't help.

728
00:32:49.181 --> 00:32:50.599
you go to the streets.

729
00:32:52.184 --> 00:32:54.311
so I try that shit.

730
00:32:54.395 --> 00:32:55.646
the problem
is I'm a lightweight.

731
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.149
Most of my friends been doing
like drugs and shit for 20 years

732
00:32:58.941 --> 00:33:00.735
and I'm the n****
that needs adult supervision

733
00:33:00.818 --> 00:33:01.861
when I drink white wine

734
00:33:01.944 --> 00:33:05.281
cause like this mother fucker
on the Pino Grigio again.

735
00:33:05.364 --> 00:33:06.407
he's getting emotional.

736
00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.576
[laughs]

737
00:33:08.659 --> 00:33:10.995
They'd be in the club. they'd be
on Hennessey and Vodka

738
00:33:11.078 --> 00:33:12.079
and be ready to fight like.

739
00:33:12.163 --> 00:33:13.748
we're gonna fuck
those mother fucker ups.

740
00:33:13.831 --> 00:33:16.375
and I'm in the back all sensual
like man y'all go ahead.

741
00:33:17.793 --> 00:33:19.712
I'm just gonna stay here
and rub myself.

742
00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:22.965
They turned up. I'm turned on.
you know what I mean?

743
00:33:23.591 --> 00:33:25.593
You gonna see the n****
in the club dancing on beat.

744
00:33:25.676 --> 00:33:27.261
just rubbing his thighs
together.

745
00:33:27.636 --> 00:33:28.888
they're playing track music.

746
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:30.514
there's me in the back singing
this shit.

747
00:33:31.182 --> 00:33:32.600
thinking jacking off
with no hands

748
00:33:32.683 --> 00:33:33.768
that's all he doing.

749
00:33:33.851 --> 00:33:35.186
[laughs]

750
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:36.645
That's why he got his hands up.

751
00:33:36.729 --> 00:33:38.814
He's a guilty little mother
fucker. he like y'all go ahead.

752
00:33:38.939 --> 00:33:40.524
[laughs]

753
00:33:43.319 --> 00:33:45.613
I tried ecstasy one time
and I almost fucked a dog.

754
00:33:45.696 --> 00:33:46.781
That ever happened to anybody?

755
00:33:48.366 --> 00:33:50.951
Cause they can't see [inaudible]

756
00:33:51.035 --> 00:33:53.746
most drugs sneak up on you like
uh oh my nipples getting hard.

757
00:33:53.829 --> 00:33:56.457
I think the white wine
about to sneak in.

758
00:33:58.334 --> 00:33:59.919
The ecstasy was
like a drug raid.

759
00:34:00.002 --> 00:34:01.003
it was just like boom.

760
00:34:01.087 --> 00:34:02.671
next thing getting move
it's getting fucked. And

761
00:34:03.798 --> 00:34:06.092
I look in the corner
and a little dog tucked his tail

762
00:34:06.175 --> 00:34:08.344
between his legs.
I was like that n**** moved.

763
00:34:08.427 --> 00:34:11.138
[laughs]

764
00:34:11.222 --> 00:34:13.349
I was like man I need something
more natural than this man.

765
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.602
All this synthetic man
made shit.

766
00:34:16.686 --> 00:34:18.813
you got anything that grows
from the earth that I could do?

767
00:34:19.397 --> 00:34:22.108
Didn't I try weed. but I don't
like the way weed make me think.

768
00:34:22.775 --> 00:34:24.902
I'm like man if Harriet Tubman
had a Fitbit.

769
00:34:24.985 --> 00:34:27.113
how many steps do you think
she would have altogether?

770
00:34:27.196 --> 00:34:34.203
[laughs]

771
00:34:35.079 --> 00:34:37.039
She gotta have the biggest badge
out there.

772
00:34:37.123 --> 00:34:38.124
you know what I mean?

773
00:34:38.624 --> 00:34:40.876
she's short too. so that's
a whole bunch of steps.

774
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.796
[laughs]

775
00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:46.632
Three. creek.

776
00:34:48.259 --> 00:34:50.052
They used to make Fitbit
for n****

777
00:34:51.053 --> 00:34:53.222
One step forward.
two steps back.

778
00:34:56.267 --> 00:34:58.561
N**** been walking
for ten years like god damn.

779
00:34:58.644 --> 00:35:00.563
I only got 500 steps.

780
00:35:01.272 --> 00:35:02.732
I'm like it don't matter
you're in prison.

781
00:35:02.815 --> 00:35:04.191
keeping walking. god damn.

782
00:35:12.825 --> 00:35:14.994
You keep trying.
you'll find your drug of choice.

783
00:35:16.495 --> 00:35:18.706
I was in the desert one night
and trying some shrooms.

784
00:35:19.248 --> 00:35:21.709
[air blowing]

785
00:35:22.334 --> 00:35:26.630
[scream]

786
00:35:27.715 --> 00:35:29.175
Took the fuck off.

787
00:35:31.302 --> 00:35:33.971
Bro' I walked in the desert
a black man and came back out

788
00:35:34.055 --> 00:35:35.765
a human being. you know
what the fuck I'm saying?

789
00:35:37.183 --> 00:35:38.184
It makes sense?

790
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:41.103
Like being a black person
you have thought.

791
00:35:41.187 --> 00:35:43.481
you have something
that comes with that.

792
00:35:44.273 --> 00:35:47.109
you know the black experience
comes with being black.

793
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:50.363
I find a restaurant
and they ain't serving me

794
00:35:50.696 --> 00:35:51.697
and they taking too long.

795
00:35:51.781 --> 00:35:53.616
I'd be like man they're taking
too long cause I'm black.

796
00:35:54.158 --> 00:35:56.744
But the human experience is like
man they're taking too long

797
00:35:57.244 --> 00:35:58.496
because they're black.

798
00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:05.586
[laughs]

799
00:36:06.295 --> 00:36:07.296
Does that make sense?

800
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.548
The victimized part of it
was gone.

801
00:36:15.096 --> 00:36:17.098
Everything felt different.
the wind.

802
00:36:18.933 --> 00:36:20.810
I remember when I felt
the breeze

803
00:36:21.185 --> 00:36:24.063
and it lay onto this tree
and all the leaves in the trees

804
00:36:24.146 --> 00:36:26.107
were just fluttering
just like this right here.

805
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.777
But to you this is like
a gold piece of shit

806
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.861
fluttering in the wind.

807
00:36:32.279 --> 00:36:34.115
But all these was talking
to one another

808
00:36:34.198 --> 00:36:35.866
and they spoke
their own languages.

809
00:36:37.785 --> 00:36:39.787
and I was like these leaves
are people.

810
00:36:40.955 --> 00:36:44.125
The stems are their family.
the branches are their culture

811
00:36:44.208 --> 00:36:46.460
and the trunk all the way
to the ground.

812
00:36:46.544 --> 00:36:48.838
I was like oh shit we come
from the same source.

813
00:36:48.921 --> 00:36:50.798
We just branched out
over the years.

814
00:36:52.341 --> 00:36:53.342
It's amazing.

815
00:36:55.136 --> 00:36:58.556
I took one step forward
and I was like holy shit.

816
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.183
this leg is in the future.

817
00:37:01.267 --> 00:37:03.811
[laughs]

818
00:37:03.894 --> 00:37:05.604
And this leg is in the past.

819
00:37:06.355 --> 00:37:08.774
And this is the present.
oh shit.

820
00:37:09.775 --> 00:37:12.278
The past. present and future
is all one.

821
00:37:13.029 --> 00:37:14.530
I discovered time traveling.

822
00:37:14.864 --> 00:37:19.076
Future. future. past.
past. past. future.

823
00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.328
future. past. past.

824
00:37:21.412 --> 00:37:23.664
Slavery. future. future.

825
00:37:28.377 --> 00:37:29.628
Anxiety.

826
00:37:31.047 --> 00:37:32.048
present.

827
00:37:33.257 --> 00:37:34.258
trauma.

828
00:37:35.134 --> 00:37:36.135
present.

829
00:37:38.721 --> 00:37:40.181
Holy shit.

830
00:37:42.808 --> 00:37:44.810
I realized how important
the present was.

831
00:37:46.562 --> 00:37:48.105
I no longer had anxiety.

832
00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:51.609
cause anxiety is worrying
about the future.

833
00:37:51.692 --> 00:37:53.027
I never had trauma.

834
00:37:53.527 --> 00:37:54.862
cause that's in the past.

835
00:37:55.529 --> 00:37:56.906
so I was just able to play.

836
00:37:56.989 --> 00:37:59.575
I was skipping around
I felt free for the first time.

837
00:37:59.658 --> 00:38:02.328
I was like little kids. woah.

838
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:05.456
I felt good skipping
round the desert and shit.

839
00:38:05.539 --> 00:38:07.291
I felt one with the world.

840
00:38:07.792 --> 00:38:09.210
I understood where love was.

841
00:38:09.293 --> 00:38:10.920
I was connected
to the every living thing.

842
00:38:11.003 --> 00:38:12.797
even the god damn sea turtles.

843
00:38:17.176 --> 00:38:18.469
I met the creator.

844
00:38:20.304 --> 00:38:22.014
felt like God was the ocean.

845
00:38:22.973 --> 00:38:25.184
Each one of us is just
tiny little waves.

846
00:38:25.351 --> 00:38:27.895
a part of this whole big
collective.

847
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.271
It was amazing.

848
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.065
it was beautiful.

849
00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.988
And I was like you know
how many n**** I know

850
00:38:38.072 --> 00:38:39.532
that don't feel free right now.

851
00:38:39.949 --> 00:38:41.951
I got to save
these mother fuckers.

852
00:38:42.952 --> 00:38:44.537
The way I feel

853
00:38:45.287 --> 00:38:47.081
this will solve
a lot of our problems.

854
00:38:48.749 --> 00:38:50.668
cause we spend a lot of time
in the past

855
00:38:50.751 --> 00:38:53.963
instead of looking forward.
instead of being here right now.

856
00:38:55.339 --> 00:38:56.799
I was like I gotta
just let my people go.

857
00:38:56.882 --> 00:38:58.134
I gotta save my people.

858
00:38:58.592 --> 00:39:00.845
and I started trying to convince
n**** to do shrooms.

859
00:39:01.095 --> 00:39:02.847
[laughs]

860
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:04.974
N**** scared as fuck
of doing schrooms

861
00:39:07.351 --> 00:39:09.687
and I'm like man I must be

874
00:39:36.672 --> 00:39:38.382
you know what the fuck happened
to us in the past?

875
00:39:39.467 --> 00:39:41.093

876
00:39:41.177 --> 00:39:42.636

my rent this month.

877
00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.764

878
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.433
in the future

879
00:39:47.516 --> 00:39:49.060
I think I'm just gonna smoke
this weed

880
00:39:49.435 --> 00:39:50.811
and stay right here.

881
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.898
I feel safe. woah. woah.
oh shit. what is that?

882
00:40:00.488 --> 00:40:01.489
And I realized

883
00:40:02.323 --> 00:40:03.991
trying to convince n**** to do
this shit.

884
00:40:05.117 --> 00:40:06.327
that if this was
any other n****.

885
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:07.411
they wouldn't entertain them.

886
00:40:08.454 --> 00:40:10.373
When you talk like this
and your dad's schizophrenic.

887
00:40:10.456 --> 00:40:14.126
They'd be like oh n****.
you sound like your dad.

888
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:15.711
[laughs]

889
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.547
And I'm free.
I'm like no n****.

890
00:40:19.673 --> 00:40:21.759
you think the government
are trying to put microchips

891
00:40:21.842 --> 00:40:22.843
in the vaccine.

892
00:40:23.636 --> 00:40:25.429
you sound like my dad.

893
00:40:33.312 --> 00:40:35.064
We all been divided
by some shit.

894
00:40:35.147 --> 00:40:37.316
we arguing over shit
that don't make sense.

895
00:40:37.817 --> 00:40:39.610
You got people over here
who think they're free

896
00:40:39.694 --> 00:40:41.612
arguing with these people
who think they're free.

897
00:40:41.862 --> 00:40:43.489
but none of 'em free.

898
00:40:46.492 --> 00:40:48.035
Somebody planned this.

899
00:40:49.745 --> 00:40:51.622
They separating us on purpose.

900
00:40:53.874 --> 00:40:56.627
The base of the pyramid
is as strong as god damn shit

901
00:40:56.711 --> 00:40:57.753
of the pyramid.

902
00:41:01.424 --> 00:41:02.967
Whether you're free is a problem

903
00:41:05.011 --> 00:41:06.262
cause they say you're crazy.

904
00:41:09.598 --> 00:41:10.891
and I was like maybe
you're right.

905
00:41:12.101 --> 00:41:13.602
I am the son of a schizo.

906
00:41:14.603 --> 00:41:16.230
If me and my dad had get it
to it before.

907
00:41:16.313 --> 00:41:17.898
and I'd be like man this mother
fucker tripping.

908
00:41:17.982 --> 00:41:19.066
but after I'd had
these schrooms.

909
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.819
I was like oh he just tripping.

910
00:41:24.405 --> 00:41:25.823
He just on another plane.

911
00:41:27.825 --> 00:41:28.826
It's true.

912
00:41:31.037 --> 00:41:32.621
People try to knock me
off my game.

913
00:41:34.623 --> 00:41:36.333
I don't see the world
the same no more.

914
00:41:36.834 --> 00:41:38.919
I see patterns and civilization
and shit.

915
00:41:39.128 --> 00:41:40.880
you know what this chick
told me. I don't give a fuck

916
00:41:40.963 --> 00:41:42.923
about the Me Too movement.
I'm black first

917
00:41:43.007 --> 00:41:45.801
then I'm a woman. and I was
like damn that's intense.

918
00:41:48.429 --> 00:41:50.222
I'm a... I'm black first.

919
00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:52.475
she was like what are you
n****?

920
00:41:54.894 --> 00:41:56.562
I was like man I'm black third.

921
00:41:56.645 --> 00:41:59.190
[laughs]

922
00:41:59.273 --> 00:42:01.275
What the fuck are you saying?
What are you first?

923
00:42:01.359 --> 00:42:04.445
I'm a spiritual being sent here
to have a human experience.

924
00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.074
What are you second?
I'm a man second.

925
00:42:08.157 --> 00:42:10.242
Why the fuck are you gonna say
you're a man second?

926
00:42:10.743 --> 00:42:14.955
Cause I had man thoughts
before I had black thoughts.

927
00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:17.458
[laughs]

928
00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:19.293
When I have gas.

929
00:42:19.377 --> 00:42:21.087
I don't be like man I go

930
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.338

931
00:42:24.006 --> 00:42:26.884
Why on [inaudible]

932
00:42:27.009 --> 00:42:28.427
this shit is fucked up.

933
00:42:31.389 --> 00:42:33.057
All stomachs matter.

934
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.643
[laughs]

935
00:42:37.728 --> 00:42:38.896
I don't.

936
00:42:41.399 --> 00:42:43.734
When I see titties.
I have man thoughts.

937
00:42:44.694 --> 00:42:45.695
I'd be like...

938
00:42:45.778 --> 00:42:47.697

939
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:52.493
[laughs]

940
00:42:52.576 --> 00:42:55.079
They're really baby thoughts
but they are mans.

941
00:42:55.162 --> 00:42:58.916
[laughs]

942
00:43:03.546 --> 00:43:06.215
She got mad.
she couldn't handle that shit.

943
00:43:08.175 --> 00:43:09.635
She kept trying to convince me

944
00:43:10.511 --> 00:43:12.972
that I was something
that I left.

945
00:43:15.307 --> 00:43:17.351
She's like you're still a n****
when they see you.

946
00:43:18.602 --> 00:43:20.730
The cops see you. they ain't
gonna see your spirit.

947
00:43:20.813 --> 00:43:21.814
they'll see you as a n****.

948
00:43:21.897 --> 00:43:23.315
What happens when the police
pull you over?

949
00:43:23.399 --> 00:43:25.693
You still gonna be spiritual.

950
00:43:27.278 --> 00:43:28.279
I was like yeah.

951
00:43:29.613 --> 00:43:31.615
Police pulled me over.
you know why I pulled you over?

952
00:43:31.824 --> 00:43:33.534
Who says you pulled me over
officer?

953
00:43:33.617 --> 00:43:39.165
[laughs]

954
00:43:39.248 --> 00:43:41.208
How do know our paths
weren't meant to cross

955
00:43:41.292 --> 00:43:42.501
at this very moment?

956
00:43:44.003 --> 00:43:46.422
And I didn't pull you over.

957
00:43:46.505 --> 00:43:53.512
[laughs]

958
00:43:54.263 --> 00:43:55.890
That'd scare
the fuck out of police.

959
00:43:57.558 --> 00:43:59.310
They'd Taser me just out of fear
along. like...

960
00:43:59.393 --> 00:44:00.519
[imitating Taser sound]

961
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.522
bearing in mind the Taser
will give me energy.

962
00:44:03.814 --> 00:44:06.150
Oh shit back at you officer.

963
00:44:07.943 --> 00:44:09.862
He'll be even more scared
sitting back up.

964
00:44:13.032 --> 00:44:14.450
We've got a free one
running around.

965
00:44:16.577 --> 00:44:17.828
Stay outside the matrix.

966
00:44:17.953 --> 00:44:19.872
[laughs]

967
00:44:26.587 --> 00:44:28.923
We got to think different.
we're always beefing about shit.

968
00:44:30.383 --> 00:44:31.425
It don't matter what it is.

969
00:44:31.509 --> 00:44:33.427
It could be vaccines.
it could be race.

970
00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:37.723
it could be fucking
the generational shit.

971
00:44:38.516 --> 00:44:42.019
Beefing with your grandfather.

Oh really. oh really.

975

That's been happening
since the beginning of time.

976
00:44:58.953 --> 00:45:00.955
As soon as that first ape.

00:47:30.187 --> 00:47:33.482
You can't twerk for 17 minutes
with eight pair of underwear on.

1034
00:47:33.566 --> 00:47:35.359
You would get a yeast infection
off that bitch.

1035
00:47:36.569 --> 00:47:37.653
That's why
when they would dance.

1036
00:47:37.737 --> 00:47:39.655
they would waltz like this.
let their thing air out.

1037
00:47:39.739 --> 00:47:44.660
You see that boom. boom.
get the air in there. oof. woof.

1038
00:47:45.077 --> 00:47:46.245
They'd look each other
in the eye.

1039
00:47:46.328 --> 00:47:47.329
and have conversations.

1040
00:47:47.413 --> 00:47:49.373
Damn. girl you're thick
as hell in that dress.

1041
00:47:49.832 --> 00:47:51.125
Where the fuck are you from?

1042
00:47:51.792 --> 00:47:53.502
How many slaves your family own?

1043
00:47:55.004 --> 00:47:56.172
Run that Beethoven game.

1044
00:47:56.255 --> 00:47:57.757
gotta get back
to that stagecoach.

1045
00:47:58.758 --> 00:48:00.301
Take out the long white glove.

1046
00:48:01.719 --> 00:48:07.516
[laughs]

1047
00:48:07.892 --> 00:48:09.518
go under that underwear.

1048
00:48:11.395 --> 00:48:13.814
over that underwear.
under the underwear.

1049
00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.859
over the underwear.
under the underwear.

1050
00:48:16.942 --> 00:48:18.110
over the underwear.

1051
00:48:19.695 --> 00:48:21.572
feel a lot of pubic hair.

1052
00:48:23.032 --> 00:48:25.117
splash.

1053
00:48:26.786 --> 00:48:27.787
Pull the hand out.

1054
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:29.538
put the long white gloves
back on.

1055
00:48:30.331 --> 00:48:32.458
and smell it through the glove.
mm.

1056
00:48:34.043 --> 00:48:35.294
Rotisserie.

1057
00:48:35.378 --> 00:48:39.048
[laughs]

1058
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:40.925
I don't know what pussy smelt
like back then.

1059
00:48:41.801 --> 00:48:43.386
mm. hickory.

1060
00:48:45.763 --> 00:48:48.015
Need a good strong outdoorsy
woman.

1061
00:48:50.518 --> 00:48:52.603
Got tailed by the glove
in the viscose.

1062
00:48:52.687 --> 00:48:54.939
the moistness as it seeps
through the leather.

1063
00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.406
that's how my granddad used
to describe pussy.

1064
00:49:04.073 --> 00:49:06.325
Like grandson I want
some good sweet pussy.

1065
00:49:06.409 --> 00:49:09.328
I'm like damn grandad. why do
you blink your eyes like that?

1066
00:49:09.412 --> 00:49:11.622
[laughs]

1067
00:49:11.706 --> 00:49:13.207
That's a different generation
of men.

1068
00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:15.000
they would make noises
when they talked about pussy.

1069
00:49:15.084 --> 00:49:17.086
They'd be like mm. mm. mm.

1070
00:49:17.169 --> 00:49:19.630
[laughs]

1071
00:49:19.714 --> 00:49:22.717
Shit. grandad you can still
taste it.

1072
00:49:24.552 --> 00:49:26.095
How sweet was that pussy.

1073
00:49:27.138 --> 00:49:29.557
That's why my generation
got diabetes right there.

1074
00:49:39.525 --> 00:49:41.068
I'd wanna light one of them man.

1075
00:49:41.736 --> 00:49:42.820
My dad liked women.

1076
00:49:43.571 --> 00:49:45.489
He'd get that look in the eyes
like a kids have.

1077
00:49:45.573 --> 00:49:46.574
When he would see women

1078
00:49:46.657 --> 00:49:47.992
they would get
in that playful mode.

1079
00:49:48.784 --> 00:49:51.078
I'd be. well I'd be always calm
and shit.

1080
00:49:52.371 --> 00:49:54.331
maybe free. I could never be
that free.

1081
00:49:56.375 --> 00:49:58.753
See my dad hollering at women.
I'd be like damn why the fuck

1082
00:49:58.836 --> 00:50:00.963
can you be so free?
Why can't I be that free?

1083
00:50:02.381 --> 00:50:03.382
Why was I robbed?

1084
00:50:03.466 --> 00:50:04.884
What was I robbed of?

1085
00:50:07.011 --> 00:50:10.806
And I was like oh my babysitter
sucked my dick when I was 10.

1086
00:50:16.604 --> 00:50:18.522
So it changed
the whole trajectory.

1087
00:50:21.776 --> 00:50:23.611
You tell a woman.
and they'd be like you was.

1088
00:50:23.736 --> 00:50:25.571
you was sexually abused

1089
00:50:26.864 --> 00:50:29.450
and like how I was abused
when she sucked my dick?

1090
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:34.872
You always get a women's side
of the story

1091
00:50:34.955 --> 00:50:36.791
but you never hear the guy's
side of the story.

1092
00:50:36.874 --> 00:50:38.793
The shit that happened to dudes.
as we got egos.

1093
00:50:39.543 --> 00:50:41.337
We roll with that shit
then on the way home

1094
00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:42.963
we'd be like man
what the fuck just happened?

1095
00:50:46.258 --> 00:50:47.843
I remember the first time
I was farted on.

1096
00:50:47.927 --> 00:50:48.928
It fucked me up.

1097
00:50:49.595 --> 00:50:52.139
It came out of nowhere.
that was my personal 9/11.

1098
00:50:52.223 --> 00:50:53.766
[laughs]

1099
00:50:53.849 --> 00:50:54.934
I'll never forget.

1100
00:50:58.979 --> 00:51:00.606
This chick was on top of me.
she was riding me.

1101
00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.483
we was having sex.
y'all know what that is right?

1102
00:51:02.566 --> 00:51:04.694
[laughs]

1103
00:51:04.777 --> 00:51:06.821
All of a sudden she got
this intense look in her eye.

1104
00:51:06.904 --> 00:51:09.031
I'm a gentleman. I got concern.
I lean forward.

1105
00:51:09.115 --> 00:51:11.909
she pulled back. her pussy's
spread over like a cobra.

1106
00:51:12.868 --> 00:51:15.413
and shot venom out.
I was like what the fuck.

1107
00:51:17.206 --> 00:51:19.709
I was shocked cause in my mind
hey I'm supposed to be squirting

1108
00:51:19.792 --> 00:51:20.793
on you.

1109
00:51:20.876 --> 00:51:22.795
A woman taking this equality
shit too god damn far.

1110
00:51:24.588 --> 00:51:27.133
And she kept doing it.
scoop. scoop. scoop.

1111
00:51:28.259 --> 00:51:30.052
I felt bad for the mattress.

1112
00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.847
We're banging away the fuck.
I could flip this mattress over

1113
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:33.931
and save it.

1114
00:51:34.306 --> 00:51:37.476
This shit memory foam is
a sponge and now tush tush.

1115
00:51:37.768 --> 00:51:39.311
And my ego was like
n**** do something.

1116
00:51:39.395 --> 00:51:40.563
you losing do something.

1117
00:51:40.813 --> 00:51:42.106
I panicked.
I didn't know what to do.

1118
00:51:42.189 --> 00:51:44.191
I looked that chick in the eye
and I was like eh I want you

1119
00:51:44.275 --> 00:51:45.943
to squirt in my mouth
and she was like what.

1120
00:51:46.027 --> 00:51:47.570
and I was like what?

1121
00:51:47.653 --> 00:51:49.905
[laughs]

1122
00:51:49.989 --> 00:51:52.825
And that Pino Grigio was like
tell her n****. you tell her.

1123
00:51:54.076 --> 00:51:56.245
And I was like you heard me
and she was like okay.

1124
00:51:56.328 --> 00:51:57.788
and this is how I felt
a gangster women was.

1125
00:51:57.872 --> 00:51:58.873
you know what she did?

1126
00:51:58.956 --> 00:52:00.750
She bounced twice.
she was like pow. pow.

1127
00:52:00.833 --> 00:52:02.835
and she got up and she leaned
over me and she started hitting

1128
00:52:02.918 --> 00:52:05.296
something like I don't know
what women hit but it hit this.

1129
00:52:06.338 --> 00:52:09.341
like a combination or cheat code
or some shit.

1130
00:52:09.842 --> 00:52:12.136
but she hit in two minutes
what it took me 30 minutes

1131
00:52:12.219 --> 00:52:15.473
to hit just like up. up. down.
down. left. right. left. right.

1132
00:52:15.556 --> 00:52:16.557
B. A. of it.

1133
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.561
[drowning]

1134
00:52:20.644 --> 00:52:21.896
She water-boarded me.

1135
00:52:21.979 --> 00:52:23.272
[laughs]

1136
00:52:23.356 --> 00:52:25.733
I took a warm ice bucket
challenge that night

1137
00:52:27.276 --> 00:52:28.486
and almost drowned.

1138
00:52:30.821 --> 00:52:32.740
That's when I realized
sex ain't safe.

1139
00:52:34.825 --> 00:52:37.161
Like you could die from sex
even with a condom on.

1140
00:52:37.244 --> 00:52:39.705
that shit ain't safe.
did you know that?

1141
00:52:41.999 --> 00:52:44.460
Found that night that didn't
I almost god damn suffocated

1142
00:52:44.543 --> 00:52:46.337
doing some shit I saw
on the internet.

1143
00:52:48.714 --> 00:52:51.050
called face sitting. You know
what face sitting is?

1144
00:52:51.175 --> 00:52:53.844
[laughs]

1145
00:52:53.928 --> 00:52:55.930
Church lady. do you know
what face sitting is?

1146
00:52:57.765 --> 00:53:01.060
Praise God. praise God.

1147
00:53:01.727 --> 00:53:06.190
[laughs]

1148
00:53:08.317 --> 00:53:09.652
Face sitting for those
who don't know

1149
00:53:09.735 --> 00:53:11.028
is when the chicks sit
on your face

1150
00:53:11.112 --> 00:53:12.113
instead of your dick.

1151
00:53:12.196 --> 00:53:14.073
this chick had an ass
and real thick thighs.

1152
00:53:14.156 --> 00:53:15.825
so when she leaned over
and hovered down.

1153
00:53:15.908 --> 00:53:17.201
everything went quiet

1154
00:53:17.284 --> 00:53:20.121
and dark if I put on giant
noise canceling headphones.

1155
00:53:20.996 --> 00:53:22.832
like I'm in airplane mode.
like a mother fucker.

1156
00:53:22.915 --> 00:53:25.501
I can't communicate and shit
and I'm trying to.

1157
00:53:25.584 --> 00:53:28.129
I'm like beating on her thighs.
and she is riding hard and shit.

1158
00:53:28.295 --> 00:53:30.256
and I'm yelling
but the sound was muffled.

1159
00:53:30.339 --> 00:53:36.470
I'm like help. help.
help. help. help. help. help.

1160
00:53:36.554 --> 00:53:38.639
But she couldn't hear me
cause the words were bouncing

1161
00:53:38.723 --> 00:53:40.599
in her pussy
and back into my mouth.

1162
00:53:40.683 --> 00:53:42.184
I was eating my own words.

1163
00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:46.731
And that's when I felt weak
like I'm about to faint.

1164
00:53:46.814 --> 00:53:48.649
like I'm about to die. I thought
about that phone call

1165
00:53:48.733 --> 00:53:49.734
my mum would get.

1166
00:53:50.735 --> 00:53:52.737
where she found out
what the fuck face sitting is.

1167
00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:53.863
[laughs]

1168
00:53:53.946 --> 00:53:55.322
Cause she gotta
come to the morgue

1169
00:53:55.406 --> 00:53:57.658
and they pull me out of that
filing cabinet like yes man.

1170
00:53:59.493 --> 00:54:00.745
You could tell he was
face sitting

1171
00:54:00.828 --> 00:54:05.499
because his mouth is open
and his eyes are closed.

1172
00:54:06.625 --> 00:54:08.169
and he got a substance
on his ace

1173
00:54:08.252 --> 00:54:10.129
that they call truffle butter.

1174
00:54:11.922 --> 00:54:13.674
Truffle butters when the juice
from the pussy

1175
00:54:13.758 --> 00:54:16.218
and the ass mix together
in a butter like substance.

1176
00:54:16.802 --> 00:54:18.512
Don't oh that.
they sell it in restaurants.

1177
00:54:18.596 --> 00:54:19.597
It's expensive as shit!

1178
00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:22.350
[laughs]

1179
00:54:22.433 --> 00:54:23.893
Either way that's what gave me
the strength

1180
00:54:23.976 --> 00:54:25.061
to get that mother fucker off me

1181
00:54:25.144 --> 00:54:26.729
cause I refused to go out
like that.

1182
00:54:27.104 --> 00:54:29.398
Having my mum explain
to her church friends

1183
00:54:29.482 --> 00:54:30.858
what the fuck face sitting is.

1184
00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.362
Walking around morning
with an all black t-shirt on

1185
00:54:34.445 --> 00:54:35.738
with I can't breathe on it.

1186
00:54:35.821 --> 00:54:42.828
[laughs]

1187
00:54:44.246 --> 00:54:46.457
I wanna thank you all
from the bottom of my heart

1188
00:54:47.583 --> 00:54:50.002
for watching my super bowl.

1189
00:54:50.419 --> 00:54:53.631
[ovation]

1190
00:54:54.256 --> 00:54:55.257
Thank you.

1191
00:54:58.135 --> 00:54:59.804
God bless you all man for real.

1192
00:54:59.887 --> 00:55:01.722
I know it's passed
your bed time.

1193
00:55:01.806 --> 00:55:04.517
This is late for some of you
all. you know what I mean?

1194
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.018
This is a realistic hour.

1195
00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:08.062
I love it. shit got real
at this hour.

1196
00:55:08.604 --> 00:55:12.149
Ain't no thinking going on once
you get passed 11 o'clock baby.

1197
00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:15.444
All the drugs come out
and pants come down...

1198
00:55:15.528 --> 00:55:17.321
okay no. there's church women
in here.

1199
00:55:17.822 --> 00:55:20.449
My mum is in here somewhere man.
shout out to my momma.

1200

[claps]

1201
00:55:25.955 --> 00:55:27.581
You think how the fuck
can you talk like this

1202
00:55:27.665 --> 00:55:28.666
in front of your mama?

1203
00:55:28.749 --> 00:55:30.292
N****.
this life is real n****.

1204
00:55:30.376 --> 00:55:31.627
we've been through some shit.

1205
00:55:32.253 --> 00:55:35.381
I always felt that
if you can't speak this way

1206
00:55:35.464 --> 00:55:36.632
in front of your mama.

1207
00:55:37.258 --> 00:55:39.301
then somethings wrong.
like you're fake.

1208
00:55:39.719 --> 00:55:41.721
Like even when I was hustling
my mum knew

1209
00:55:42.555 --> 00:55:43.931
cause a lot of y'all put faith
in n****

1210
00:55:44.015 --> 00:55:46.809
that even don't come and get you
when the police come.

1211
00:55:47.643 --> 00:55:49.937
but I know my mum was gonna be
there. you know what I mean.

1212
00:55:50.229 --> 00:55:52.106
so I always let her know
what the fuck was going on.

1213
00:55:52.189 --> 00:55:54.775
she knew. she knew.
she had to know you know.

1214
00:55:55.401 --> 00:55:57.278
So. you know.
she was a young mother.

1215
00:55:57.361 --> 00:55:58.362
she went through a lot.

1216
00:55:58.446 --> 00:56:01.574
so you know I won't give her
her flowers a lot.

1217
00:56:01.657 --> 00:56:03.034
but I really appreciate you.

1218
00:56:04.827 --> 00:56:06.287
Thank you mama
you know what I mean.

1219
00:56:07.371 --> 00:56:10.207
Regardless to what I think
and all we went through

1220
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:15.796
you know I've had a great great
you know ending so far.

1221
00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.590
