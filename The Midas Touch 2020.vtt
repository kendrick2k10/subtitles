What do you say about the lady there. huh?

51
00:05:44.653 --> 00:05:47.653
(smooth jazz music)

52
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.010
I have a responsibility to my inferiors

53
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.614
that I don't take lightly. Felix.

- Oh. come on. You know who
I'm talking about. The lady!

57
00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:13.963
The one you've been eating
up with your bug eyes.

58
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.720
My flavor of the day.

59
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.593
- Your flavor?

60
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.223
- She's here for me. not for you.

61
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.733
Not in your wettest dreams.

62
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.060
You know. you wouldn't know
what to do with her anyway.

63
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.750
Some people have a way with
women and you ain't one of them.

64
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.930
You're good with papers and pencils

65
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.973
and flipcharts. That sort of thing.

66
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.920
What we need here is someone
suave. someone sophisticated.

67
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.470
someone like...

68
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.920
Well. let me tell you
one thing. my friend:

69
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.240
If you wanna please the customer.

70
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.613
you gotta please the
chicks around him first.

71
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.363
You're aiming way too high. buddy.

72
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.463
Hey Jane!

73
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.480
If you need somewhere to put your handbag.

74
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.410
you can hang it on Felix's hard on.

75
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.875
He's crazy for the lady.
(Jane and Ron laugh)

76
00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:15.570
On second thought. don't hang it.

77
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.081
We don't know how solid this guy is. huh?

78
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:20.480
(Jane and Ron laugh)

79
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.313
I'm busy.

80
00:07:25.134 --> 00:07:25.967
- So!

81
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.940
What did you do at the weekend?

82
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.590
- Oh. I went to the casino with a friend.

83
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.250
- Male or female?

84
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.370
- Female.

85
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.203
- What happened?

86
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.470
- We put our money together.

87
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.690
played a little Blackjack and won.

88
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.360
- [Jane] Did you fuck her?

89
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.670
- No. we split the win evenly.

90
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.503
- I mean.

91
00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:54.465
did you FUCK her?

92
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.950
- Oh. hmm. That...that's a little private.

93
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.873
- Yeah. fucking tends to be.

94
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.793
- Did you go out?

95
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.292
- Well. yeah.

96
00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:21.125
(sighs) Whatever.

97
00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:32.859
(fairytale music)

98
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.363
- Hello.

99
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.270
Are you busy?

100
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.393
- Not right now.

101
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.567
- My boy had to leave

102
00:08:43.567 --> 00:08:46.020
and I wonder if you could
help me with my boxes.

103
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.266
They're a little bit heavy. you know.

104
00:08:48.266 --> 00:08:49.849
- I bet they are.

105
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.690
Oh. I wouldn't know.

106
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.590
Only if I lifted them

107
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.720
which I...I wouldn't do.

108
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.810
un...unless you ask me to.

109
00:08:58.810 --> 00:08:59.693
like now.

110
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.363
Can we leave?

111
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.520
Do you want to leave right now?

112
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.983
- Yes. follow me.

113
00:09:08.903 --> 00:09:11.903
(walking bass music)

114
00:09:25.943 --> 00:09:29.570
(dark music)

115
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.460
- Do we have everything we need?

116
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.460
- Yep.

117
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.359
- Guns?

118
00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:34.192
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:09:34.192 --> 00:09:35.220
- Rope?

120
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.053
- We do.

121
00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:37.230
- Daggers?

122
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.000
- Of course.

123
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.710
- Do you think we'll get many?

124
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.560
- With you sir. always.

125
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.986
- Ah. the extenders!

126
00:09:44.986 --> 00:09:46.448
- Got them.

127
00:09:46.448 --> 00:09:47.303
Plenty.

128
00:09:47.303 --> 00:09:48.693
- Have you tried them on?

129
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.070
- Well. no I have not.

130
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.840
- Why not. useless?

131
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.730
I'm already doing that

132
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.440
but we must find out if they also work

133
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.983
for less endowed men like you.

134
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.910
Oh. watch out. Here they come.

135
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.513
Go. go. You've got to hide!

136
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:10.362
(dark music)
(women talking in background)

137
00:10:10.362 --> 00:10:12.836
(Sviatoslav groans)

138
00:10:13.719 --> 00:10:15.400
Oh...

139
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.766
My leg.

140
00:10:20.229 --> 00:10:22.113
- Have you hurt yourself. sir?

141
00:10:22.113 --> 00:10:24.060
- Yes. very much so dear.

142
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.765
Come a little closer.

143
00:10:25.765 --> 00:10:27.487
(dark music)

144
00:10:27.487 --> 00:10:29.880
- Yah!

145
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.630
(dark music)

146
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.713
- Are you on your way?

147
00:10:42.171 --> 00:10:43.500
- Where to?

148
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.010
- I can show you.

149
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.500
I can open your eyes and make you see.

150
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.680
All the beauty there is in this world.

151
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.760
Everything we love

152
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.683
but also what we hate.

153
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.287
All the dangers lurking in the dark.

154
00:10:58.287 --> 00:11:00.910
- Yahahahaha!

155
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.045
- Excuse me.

156
00:11:02.045 --> 00:11:02.878
- Yeah?

157
00:11:02.878 --> 00:11:04.805
- Are you easily scared?

158
00:11:04.805 --> 00:11:05.663
- What?

159
00:11:05.663 --> 00:11:06.620
- Whoohaha!

160
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.550
- Then. you should come to my seminar!

161
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.890
I'll help you build up self esteem

162
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.530
and learn to defend yourself
in dangerous situations.

163
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:19.030
A.C.T. Analysis. Control. Transformation.

164
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.290
I'll teach you to be the woman
you've always wanted to be.

165
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:27.140
Blossom mentally.
spiritually and sexually.

166
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.770
I also offer a large collection of toys

167
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.170
of the highest standard
and adult entertainment.

168
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.357
Viewer discretion is advised.

169
00:11:38.208 --> 00:11:41.208
(a touch of clarinet music)

170
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.460
This has been an extremely successful day.

171
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.610
Is the venue organized?

172
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.248
- Yup.

173
00:11:51.248 --> 00:11:53.380
- I hope it's gonna be big enough.

174
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.290
Well. after a strenuous day

175
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.120
even men of great mental capacity

176
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.917
and physical strength like
myself. should relax a little

177
00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:05.130
and you. with your limited resources.

178
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.981
definitely need to unwind.

179
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.083
(a touch of clarinet music)

180
00:12:24.003 --> 00:12:26.920
(women screaming)

181
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.440
No. don't...don't scare them anymore.

182
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.950
We're through with this for to...

183
00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:37.250
Why didn't you tell me I'm still wearing

184
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.450
the penis extender. you idiot.

185
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.660
- I thought you saw that.

186
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.660
- See that?

187
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.890
I don't see my penis. It's not my job!

188
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.810
It's YOUR job to see my penis.

189
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.460
I see where it's pointing
and follow its lead.

190
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.410
- I'm sorry boss. I'm so sorry.

191
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.370
From now on. I'll watch
your penis constantly.

192
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.153
- You sick little pervert!

193
00:12:54.153 --> 00:12:56.310
I won't have you watch my penis.

194
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.750
I'll get somebody new to do that.

195
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.601
Wait until I smash this
on your stupid head.

196
00:13:00.601 --> 00:13:02.042
- No. no. No! No.

197
00:13:02.042 --> 00:13:05.042
(a minor touch sax music)

198
00:13:23.671 --> 00:13:26.004
- It's not too heavy. is it?

199
00:13:27.405 --> 00:13:28.822
- No. not at all.

200
00:13:30.568 --> 00:13:33.568
(a minor touch sax music)

201
00:14:23.805 --> 00:14:27.055
- [Sarah] I want you to meet Nevinovat.

202
00:14:30.658 --> 00:14:33.291
Elena

203
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.740
and Sarita.

204
00:14:40.845 --> 00:14:42.860
Girls. this is (snaps fingers)

205
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.190
- Felix.

206
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.908
- [Together] Hi. Felix.

207
00:14:45.908 --> 00:14:49.207
- Hi...girls.

208
00:14:49.207 --> 00:14:52.007
- Elena. why don't you tell
Felix what it is that we do.

209
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:54.613
- We praise.

210
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.236
- Praise? Sure there's
always something to...

211
00:15:00.236 --> 00:15:01.069
- Sarita.

212
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:02.963
- We worship.

213
00:15:05.227 --> 00:15:08.216
- Good for you. Good for you!

214
00:15:08.216 --> 00:15:09.560
- Nevinovat.

215
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.253
- We praise and worship
our savior in song.

216
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.320
- Of course you do.

217
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.890
What a great way of saving your face...

218
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.660
of praising your save...

219
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.530
Sa...savior in song.

220
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.100
- He's respected.

221
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.530
- We are connected.

222
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.630
- He's beloved.

223
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.920
- And he's above it.

224
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.410
- He'll always lead us.

225
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.110
- [Elena] Knows how to feed us.

226
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.680
- He brings redemption

227
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.110
- and needs attention.

228
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.100
- He won't sign a waiver.

229
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.313
- [Together] He will stay our savior.

230
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.506
- Shouldn't you be practicing your songs?

231
00:15:43.506 --> 00:15:44.690
- Oh.

232
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:45.560
- Well.

233
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.450
- Yes.

234
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.963
- Can't Felix help us?

235
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.673
- Felix?

236
00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.070
- Well. I'm not much of a singer

237
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.050
but of course. I'll give it a try.

238
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.580
- Great. Well. take it away then.

239
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.823
- Listen honey. We're
gonna show you the way.

240
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:13.003
- The way?

241
00:16:13.003 --> 00:16:13.933
- To sing our song.

242
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.953
If you feel ready to
participate. just join us.

243
00:16:20.591 --> 00:16:24.600
♪ He is the hope and the goal! ♪

244
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.681
- A spiritual song. I like that.

245
00:16:25.681 --> 00:16:29.131
♪ He has the key to my soul! ♪

246
00:16:29.131 --> 00:16:30.291
Call and response. great.

247
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:34.861
♪ He knows the way it should be. ♪

248
00:16:34.861 --> 00:16:39.861
♪ He sees the truth cause He's He! ♪

249
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.758

250
00:16:44.758 --> 00:16:48.591
♪ I have the key to your soul! ♪

251
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.200
- Don't sing that part.

252
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.723
It's our savior's part.

253
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.390
- Oh. I understand.

254
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:03.030
Well. I guess he better
sing that part then.

255
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.053
- Do you want a Mojito?

256
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.743
- Yeah. sure. Why not?

257
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.207
I mean. thank you ma'am.

258
00:17:32.137 --> 00:17:33.737
- [Sarah] You may call me Sarah.

259
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.760
- Why?

260
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.963
- Because I say so.

261
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.860
And now sit down and have

262
00:17:41.902 --> 00:17:43.493
(drop leaking)

263
00:17:43.493 --> 00:17:45.270
(sizzling sound)

264
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.103
a drink.

265
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.101
I'm going upstairs to my husband now.

266
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:55.100
(dramatic fairytale music)

267
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.350
Go back to the girls. They
have more songs to show you.

268
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.350
(dramatic fairytale music)

269
00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.430
- Thank you. honey.

270
00:18:21.473 --> 00:18:23.320
- Nice to see you again. Felix.

271
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.583
Did you come up with
the idea to this spot?

272
00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:28.200
- I had an idea for the spot
but Ron wouldn't have it.

273
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.620
If you analyze the current political...

274
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.410
- Don't analyze.

275
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.550
Just feel

276
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.600
and you'll get there!

277
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.520
Did you enjoy singing with the girls?

278
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.073
You must visit us again soon.

279
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.010
I see a bright future
for you. my dear Felix

280
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.010
but right now. you're
just a very quiet man

281
00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.563
in a very loud world.

282
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.153
- Okay. let's go for a first take.

283
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.713
- Walker Power: Scene two. take one.

284
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.690
- And action.

285
00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.870
- And that is why my wife
and I support our country

286
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.670
in every way possible.

287
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.510
Family. fatherland and fame.

288
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:24.343
- Cut.

289
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.163
Ah. it's...it's frame. not fame.

290
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.150
Family and fatherland frame our lives.

291
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.253
- Did I say fame?

292
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.740
It's that weird guy there.
he's making faces all the time.

293
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.700
He's distracting me.

294
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.290
- Faces?

295
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.970
What kind of faces?

296
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.773
- Faces like...like he
doesn't wanna vote for me.

297
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.910
- Felix. if I had a face like that.

298
00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.020
I would try to move it
as little as possible

299
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.380
in order not to attract
any unnecessary attention.

300
00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.373
Okay?

301
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.493
Just don't be a nuisance.

302
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.530
Oh and Felix? Who are you voting for?

303
00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.310
- I'm voting for Mister Walker.

304
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.750
- [Ron] And why?

305
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.600
- I think the socio-economical situation

306
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.860
during the last administration...

307
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.433
- The slogan. Felix!

308
00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.100
- Oh. yes. of course.

309
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.168
Family and fatherland frame his wife.

310
00:20:25.168 --> 00:20:26.001
- What?

311
00:20:26.001 --> 00:20:28.390
- Ah...our lives. Our lives!

312
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:31.333
- [Ron] Okay. let's just start
from the top again. okay?

313
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.353
- Walker Power: Scene two. take two.

314
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.143
- [Ron] And action.

315
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.980
- For family and
fatherland I frame my wife.

316
00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.820
Why did he mention my wife?

317
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.073
That little bastard! So that's
why he's making these faces.

318
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.850
He's coming on to her.

319
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:10.850
- Uh. you know. let's
just go to page 12. okay?

320
00:21:11.367 --> 00:21:12.793
Ah...crime and punishment.

321
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.973
- Walker Power: Scene four. take one.

322
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.580
- [Ron] Action.

323
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.240
- Terrorists are flooding our country.

324
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.070
crime is at an all time high

325
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.040
and more and more people
are getting divorced.

326
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.410
but in this crisis. we
must pervert justice...

327
00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.593
- Ah...it's:"We must persevere!
Justice will reign". honey.

328
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.950
- Well. if that little
freak keeps moving around

329
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.650
that fucking sign to and
fro. how am I supposed to

330
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.570
do anything right?
- You know what.

331
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.720
Jamie. let's just forget about the text.

332
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.190
Give us one of your famous
impromptu speeches. yeah?

333
00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.433
Okay. so without the slate. just roll.

334
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.350
- We live in dark times.

335
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.610
Our cities aren't safe.

336
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.480
Scoundrels are everywhere and young people

337
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.100
indulge in dirty forms of sex.

338
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.190
Do we have to accept this?

339
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.640
Do we have to lead a low life

340
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.330
without morals and uplifting thoughts?

341
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.970
Of course we don't. because
I am the man to shed light

342
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.920
on the mess our country has become

343
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.250
and in the brightness of
day. I will clean the streets

344
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:30.930
and souls and let us all live
in prosperity and purity!

345
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.530
So watch out all you evil doers

346
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.690
and law breakers. for you are doomed

347
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.420
because I will unleash the hounds of Hell

348
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.880
to chase you from the face of the Earth.

349
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.629
I will smash and crush and destroy...

350
00:22:44.629 --> 00:22:46.630
- Jamie. wonderful!
- I will eliminate you...

351
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.490
- Wonderful! I find that quite...

352
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.690
I think that's. ah...that's
all we really need.

353
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:56.320
So. one more. just like that

354
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.860
and this time. a little
closer on Mister Walker

355
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.443
and Sarah! Why don't you
join him on this one. yeah?

356
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.630
- [Felix] Walker Power: Scene four...

357
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.443
- The slate is not in
the picture. Move it in.

358
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.193
More!

359
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:20.510
That's good. go.

360
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:23.380
- Walker Power: Scene four. take two.

361
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.613
- Ah!

362
00:23:24.613 --> 00:23:27.030
(hand slap)

363
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.540
Are we winning?

364
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.120
- You tell me! You went to the agency.

365
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.120
How are the numbers?

366
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.720
- Sure did.

367
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.320
This Ron is a creepy guy.

368
00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.220
- Why?

369
00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.530
- He's all over me half the time.

370
00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.853
- Come on. you know how
these agency guys are.

371
00:23:46.475 --> 00:23:49.110
Are you surprised he wants to fuck you?

372
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.720
Everybody does.

373
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.790
- Unless they're married to me.

374
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.943
- Honey. I've got long hours these days.

375
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.300
We gotta concentrate
on the campaign. right?

376
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.670
I am running for Governor

377
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.200
and I need all my juice
to fuck the public.

378
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.640
So if you wanna have fun.

379
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.490
you better hold my dick when I do it.

380
00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.083
Honey. I gotta go.

381
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.303
I forgot something!

382
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.480
- Oh. did you?

383
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.040
Don't be long!

384
00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.240
(She tosses the ring)

385
00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.717
- Damn. he's still inside of her.

386
00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.993
This is going to be difficult.

387
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.213
Thank God he came in through the backdoor.

388
00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.223
This makes my life a little easier.

389
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:01.761
(chuckles)

390
00:25:08.703 --> 00:25:09.536
(Elena startles)

391
00:25:09.536 --> 00:25:12.120
- What? What. what. what? What is it?

392
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.013
- Oh. I just had a nightmare.

393
00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:15.793
I was getting married.

394
00:25:17.309 --> 00:25:19.145
- Then what happened?

395
00:25:19.145 --> 00:25:22.530
- A monster came...ate
everyone up at church

396
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:23.853
right after the wedding.

397
00:25:24.858 --> 00:25:26.844
- Why are you whining?

398
00:25:26.844 --> 00:25:28.880
- I don't know.

399
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.410
It feels as if I've
just lost my only chance

400
00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.973
of ever keeping a wedding ring.

401
00:25:34.709 --> 00:25:37.042
(Elena sobs)

402
00:25:56.692 --> 00:25:57.525
Look!

403
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.023
The show is about to begin!

404
00:26:00.961 --> 00:26:05.378
(people talking in background)

405
00:26:05.378 --> 00:26:08.295
(A.C.T. theme)

406
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.402
- Ladies. welcome!

407
00:26:13.402 --> 00:26:14.671
(audience applauds)

408
00:26:14.671 --> 00:26:19.443
Welcome to our big A.C.T seminar.

409
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:26.430
Now that's A.C.T: Analysis.
Control. Transformation!

410
00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.750
In this life. we sometimes...

411
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:34.980
- [Sviatoslav] Cut it out. you idiot!

412
00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.977
This is my show. bugger off!

413
00:26:36.977 --> 00:26:39.220
(audience laughs)

414
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.780
- And now. my dear ladies.

415
00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.070
without any further ado.

416
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:49.650
I present to you the host of this show.

417
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.320
the brain behind A.C.T.

418
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.380
the source of all our inspiration!

419
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.793
I give you Sviatoslav Rău!

420
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.440
(audience applauds)

421
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.713
- Welcome ladies. welcome!

422
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.970
Tonight. my fluid. my essence

423
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.780
will enter your hearts and souls.

424
00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.320
your minds and bodies

425
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.673
to grow there and form new life.

426
00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:25.620
Tonight. I'm going to take
you to a higher level -

427
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:31.120
much higher than you ever
thought you could rise.

428
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.180
Back from my global perambulations

429
00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.750
I'm here for this special
part of our seminar

430
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.383
that is dedicated to the receiving sex.

431
00:27:44.554 --> 00:27:49.460
For the first part of our show
we need an audience member.

432
00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.293
(women shouting)

433
00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.473
Yes. you dear!

434
00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.827
Come on up. please.

435
00:28:01.185 --> 00:28:05.018
(women talking in background)

436
00:28:09.367 --> 00:28:11.000
What's your name. luv?

437
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.940
- Sarita.

438
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.120
- A little louder. honey!

439
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.953
- Sarita.

440
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:19.810
- Sarita! Now. where are you from. Sarita?

441
00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.490
- I'm from Frankton.

442
00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:23.930
- Frankton. That's just beautiful

443
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:28.223
but. more importantly.
where do you want to go?

444
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.770
- I...I don't know.

445
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.953
What do you mean?

446
00:28:32.953 --> 00:28:36.596
- You don't know. But of course not!

447
00:28:36.596 --> 00:28:39.330
You have simply no idea

448
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.370
because you're lost and alone and...

449
00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:43.726
- That's not exactly what I...

450
00:28:43.726 --> 00:28:47.180
- AND! You don't know where to go

451
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.870
but that's what you need me
for: To show you the way!

452
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.600
The way to find happiness!

453
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.600
Now. ladies of all nations.
Sarita is hauntingly beautiful.

454
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.323
BUT! What about her mind?

455
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.373
Sarita. what is eight times nine?

456
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.410
- Why?

457
00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.800
72?

458
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.010
- Well. that was easy. now. Wasn't it?

459
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:20.860
But what about we asked
Sarita what 234 times 786 is.

460
00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.960
- 183924.

461
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.460
- Yes. we can see that a
woman. however beautiful...

462
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:35.350
(upbeat jazz music)

463
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:38.920
That's remarkable. quite remarkable

464
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:43.150
but of course. we've all heard of little

465
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.743
coincidences like this one.

466
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.040
Well. Sarita. just tell me: What is 245785

467
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.823
divided by 778812?

468
00:30:01.198 --> 00:30:02.031
- 0.31559.

469
00:30:05.048 --> 00:30:08.048
(upbeat jazz music)

470
00:30:08.963 --> 00:30:11.230
- Well. seems like we're dealing

471
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.040
with a little smart ass here.

472
00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.610
Sarita. I don't think
you've quite perceived

473
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:17.810
the nature of this show.

474
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.510
There's so much more to
life than just mathematics.

475
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.980
I don't know why you're constantly
bringing up that subject.

476
00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.678
if not to brag with your
little talent there.

477
00:30:28.678 --> 00:30:30.470
- Well. I don't think it's appropriate...

478
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:31.820
to constantly interrupt a program

479
00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.430
that's been successful all over the world

480
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.080
from Budapest to Suriname?

481
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.693
Now hush up with you. you
ungrateful little brat!

482
00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.423
Let's see if we can't
find an apter contestant.

483
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.053
You!

484
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.020
(audience applauds tentatively)

485
00:31:03.097 --> 00:31:05.047
And you are?

486
00:31:05.047 --> 00:31:06.663
- Nevinovat.

487
00:31:06.663 --> 00:31:11.663
- Nevinovat. How many small
circles can a large circle hold?

488
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.690
- Well. I'm not sure.

489
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.420
Maybe 20.

490
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.990
- 20? Perhaps

491
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:23.023
or perhaps a little more?

492
00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:28.680
- Ah. possibly up to 26?

493
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.600
- Possibly. possibly.

494
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.230
Well. no. Nevinovat. No! No! No!

495
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:38.160
The correct answer is: It all depends!

496
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.568
It was actually a trick question.

497
00:31:41.568 --> 00:31:46.568
Now. Nevinovat was incapable
of construing this mystery

498
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.770
because her mind doesn't
reach the same level

499
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.249
that her beauty manages to climb to

500
00:31:54.749 --> 00:31:59.749
or as we most commonly
would put it: She is stupid!

501
00:31:59.931 --> 00:32:01.750
(audience laughs)

502
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.460
Well. don't you worry my dear

503
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.390
because an underdeveloped mental capacity

504
00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:13.390
is quite often accompanied by
a distinct moral superiority

505
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.600
because the soft-headed usually don't see

506
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.370
all the opportunities for
evil-doings in this world.

507
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.843
It is beyond their grasp!

508
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:27.843
You may sit down now. Nevinovat.

509
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:30.742
(crescendo music)

510
00:32:31.742 --> 00:32:35.090
Now this demonstrates the moral decay

511
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:39.640
of the so-called scientists
with their mathematics

512
00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.994
that have never helped anyone

513
00:32:41.994 --> 00:32:44.728
(bag smack)

514
00:32:44.728 --> 00:32:48.269
(a touch of violin music)

515
00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:55.900
- I'm so sorry. boss!

516
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.733
I wish...

517
00:32:56.733 --> 00:32:57.913
- What do I always tell you?

518
00:32:59.029 --> 00:33:00.923
- To clean up after we're done?

519
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.610
- What ELSE do I always tell you?

520
00:33:05.285 --> 00:33:07.064
Be aware of...

521
00:33:07.064 --> 00:33:09.730
- Be aware of...

522
00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.670
attacks at all times?

523
00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:12.503
- Mmhmm.

524
00:33:12.503 --> 00:33:14.283
- So sorry. boss.

525
00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:16.582
I was too far away.

526
00:33:16.582 --> 00:33:18.397
- Too far away? What do
you mean too far away?

527
00:33:18.397 --> 00:33:20.173
Too far away to shoot her?

528
00:33:20.173 --> 00:33:22.210
- No. I just thought we should better

529
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:25.084
not resort to extreme measures.

530
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.676
- Extreme measures?

531
00:33:28.676 --> 00:33:30.185
I'll show you extreme measures!

532
00:33:30.185 --> 00:33:32.700
- Boss. please. Your performance!

533
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.397
- What time is it?

534
00:33:34.397 --> 00:33:36.230
I gotta run a show here tonight!

535
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.420
Why are you talking to me?

536
00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:38.841
This is very unprofessional!

537
00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:41.257
The curtain. The curtain!

538
00:33:43.613 --> 00:33:47.130
Gentlemen! Lovers of love!

539
00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.140
You all know what it's like

540
00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.990
when spring has entered your hearts

541
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:55.570
and you want to consume
the female of your choosing

542
00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:59.490
but she makes you go
through that tedious process

543
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.420
of getting to know each other.

544
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.530
that is every woman's condition.

545
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:07.090
may it last for half an
hour or half a lifetime.

546
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:11.002
to invite you to dine
at her secret garden.

547
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.300
Tonight. I'm going to teach you

548
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.690
how to accelerate this annoying process.

549
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:22.188
I've brought to you a typical female

550
00:34:22.188 --> 00:34:24.775
(audience applauds and whistles)

551
00:34:24.775 --> 00:34:28.739
that we will now see
interact with a volunteer.

552
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.634
Yes. you in the third row
with the weirdly coloured tie.

553
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.384
Please come on up here!

554
00:34:44.793 --> 00:34:47.647
(audience applauds tentatively)

555
00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.380
Are you a wimp. young man?

556
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.213
- No.

557
00:34:53.213 --> 00:34:54.250
(clears throat)

558
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.480
- Can't hear you.
(audience laughs)

559
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.717
- No. I am not sir.

560
00:34:57.717 --> 00:35:01.130
- No. you are NOT!

561
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.610
Then make a pass at her.

562
00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:04.785
(audience laughs)

563
00:35:08.085 --> 00:35:09.948
- Hi.

564
00:35:09.948 --> 00:35:12.122
(Amalia yawns)

565
00:35:12.122 --> 00:35:13.860
(audience laughs)

566
00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.430
I just read a very interesting book.

567
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:17.400
- A book?

568
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.601
Don't you have a computer?

569
00:35:18.601 --> 00:35:19.660
(audience laughs)

570
00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.900
- Sure. I just like the look
and the smell of a book.

571
00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.157
I guess I like the
sensuous joy of reading.

572
00:35:27.157 --> 00:35:28.918
I like to touch things.

573
00:35:28.918 --> 00:35:32.005
- You like to touch
things. you little pervert?

574
00:35:32.005 --> 00:35:34.029
(audience laughs)

575
00:35:36.515 --> 00:35:39.684
- I think we've got off
on the wrong foot here.

576
00:35:39.684 --> 00:35:40.518
Let's start...

577
00:35:40.518 --> 00:35:43.147
- Well. what's the RIGHT foot?

578
00:35:43.147 --> 00:35:45.374
What the fuck do you want from me?

579
00:35:48.014 --> 00:35:52.433
- I...I just saw you standing
there and I wanted to know...i

580
00:35:52.433 --> 00:35:55.678
- How you can touch. you slimeball?

581
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.786
- Please give a warm hand
to my assistant Amalia!

582
00:36:01.786 --> 00:36:05.260
(audience applauds and cheers)

583
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.830
That was good fun now. wasn't it?

584
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.607
And we've learned quite a bit too.

585
00:36:10.607 --> 00:36:13.260
We've seen all the wrong movements.

586
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.110
heard all the wrong phrases.

587
00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:18.979
brought about with the
completely wrong attitude.

588
00:36:18.979 --> 00:36:20.250
(audience laughs)

589
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.327
You couldn't have possibly
made more mistakes. my friend!

590
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:26.564
How do you survive out there?

591
00:36:26.564 --> 00:36:29.413
The women must eat you up alive.

592
00:36:29.413 --> 00:36:32.372
Well. if only they did.

593
00:36:32.372 --> 00:36:34.309
(audience laughs and applauds)

594
00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:36.965
I have to rest my case!

595
00:36:36.965 --> 00:36:40.039
I can do a lot but with you...

596
00:36:40.039 --> 00:36:43.382
Don't forget to purchase
your personal penis extender

597
00:36:43.382 --> 00:36:45.200
on your way out.

598
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:50.197
Maybe that can help a little
bit? A tiny bit? A wee wee?

599
00:36:58.341 --> 00:37:01.341
(upbeat jazz music)

600
00:37:10.844 --> 00:37:15.011
(woman speaks Quechua)

601
00:37:28.021 --> 00:37:30.738
(upbeat jazz music)

602
00:37:34.161 --> 00:37:37.162
(women laughing and talking in background)

603
00:37:37.162 --> 00:37:39.850
- Okay girls. enough is enough!

604
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:43.210
That's it for today. I need a break!

605
00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:44.450
Go dance.

606
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.177
(upbeat jazz music)

607
00:37:52.262 --> 00:37:53.210
- What can I do for you?

608
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:54.452
- The usual.

609
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.830
- There you go.

610
00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.528
- I'll never get used to that.

611
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.510
- Doesn't seem all that hard to do.

612
00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.240
- That's what you think
because you haven't lived it.

613
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.270
- Yeah. that's for sure.

614
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:17.750
- No. no. no. Sorry mate! I
didn't mean to put you down

615
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.810
but you gotta understand:

616
00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.927
They don't always leave just like that.

617
00:38:21.927 --> 00:38:24.845
so. it's ah...

618
00:38:24.845 --> 00:38:27.010
more like a curse. you know.

619
00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:28.280
- A curse?

620
00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.370
To be successful with women?

621
00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.952
- It's not like you think.

622
00:38:31.952 --> 00:38:34.374
You can't really control it.

623
00:38:34.374 --> 00:38:35.207
- What do you mean?

624
00:38:35.207 --> 00:38:36.139
(Samyaza sighs)

625
00:38:37.409 --> 00:38:39.060
- I simply can't stop it.

626
00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.003
Just occasionally they leave me alone.

627
00:38:43.294 --> 00:38:45.894
- Are you trying to say
that it's always like this?

628
00:38:47.416 --> 00:38:49.706
- As I told you: It's a curse!

629
00:38:49.706 --> 00:38:51.842
I have been plagued by
it for 12 years now.

630
00:38:53.373 --> 00:38:55.250
- A curse?

631
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.570
You mean literally?

632
00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:58.131
- Quite literally.

633
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.180
You may find it appealing

634
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.210
and that's what I thought
at the beginning too.

635
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:06.090
As a matter of fact. that's
why I got it in the first place

636
00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.363
or rather why I let it be passed on to me.

637
00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.440
- Passed on to you?

638
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.963
- That's just how it works.

639
00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.950
You meet someone who
has had it long enough

640
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.410
to wanna get rid of it

641
00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:23.170
and then. if that man has
informed you truthfully

642
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.503
and comprehensively about
all the dangers involved.

643
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.710
it can be passed on to you.

644
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:37.554
- Could it be passed on to me?

645
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.830
- You understand that this is permanent

646
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.670
until you find somebody who
is willing to release you?

647
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.528
- Yeah.

648
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.376
- Good.

649
00:39:54.376 --> 00:39:56.872
but beware my friend
because the power that comes

650
00:39:56.872 --> 00:40:00.858
from within can never be
controlled completely.

651
00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:04.660
But they say

652
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.430
that the pure of heart
are strong enough to try.

653
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:11.018
- Done. No problem!

654
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.360
- Okay.

655
00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.290
Then we must perform the ritual now.

656
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.698
- [Felix] But how?

657
00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.069
- I'll show you.

658
00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.653
Do what I do.

659
00:40:37.357 --> 00:40:41.852
Now you're going to
say:"Please. give it to me!".

660
00:40:41.852 --> 00:40:44.750
- Please. give it to me!

661
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.004
- Now it's all yours.

662
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:52.325
Waitress?

663
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:55.398
May I have a beer please?

664
00:40:58.161 --> 00:41:00.086
- Don't touch me. dirty old man!

665
00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.480
- It's working.

666
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.450
It's working!

667
00:41:06.025 --> 00:41:08.300
I can't believe it. I really lost it.

668
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.219
I gotta go. my friend.

669
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.493
- But. what am I supposed to do now?

670
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.208
- You'll figure it out.

671
00:41:20.208 --> 00:41:24.108
It's all about the touch.
you know? You'll see.

672
00:41:24.108 --> 00:41:27.264
Just remember what I told you.

673
00:41:28.856 --> 00:41:31.681
(upbeat jazz music)

674
00:41:45.491 --> 00:41:48.491
(fairytale music/celeste version)

675
00:42:11.728 --> 00:42:14.528
(fairytale music/piano version)

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.836
(staccato music/piano version)

677
00:43:06.287 --> 00:43:09.787
(staccato music/horn(y) section)

678
00:43:31.996 --> 00:43:34.996
(fairytale music/celeste version)

679
00:44:19.585 --> 00:44:23.252
(weird music)

680
00:44:32.056 --> 00:44:35.715
(minor second music)

681
00:45:05.012 --> 00:45:08.070
(walking bass music)

682
00:45:49.285 --> 00:45:52.952
(staccato music/flute section)

683
00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:45.260
(upbeat cembalo music)

00:47:14.195 --> 00:47:17.528
(staccato music/celeste version)

(women growl)

689
00:49:05.253 --> 00:49:07.737
(minor second music)

690
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:46.057
- Hey baby. what are you up to?

691
00:49:46.057 --> 00:49:48.820
- Oh. hi. Nice to see
you but. as you can see.

692
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:49.857
I'm not in the mood.

693
00:49:49.857 --> 00:49:52.430
- But darling. what has happened to you?

694
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:54.000
- Never mind.

695
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.800
I'm...I'm okay. I just need to rest.

696
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.520
- Oh please. just let me!

697
00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.353
- No!

698
00:49:59.353 --> 00:50:01.980
I said I'm not in the mood.
You've gotta respect that.

699
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.550
I'm not your plaything. you know.

700
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.760
I'm having a terrible
headache. my ankle is hurt

701
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.197
and I just need to rest now!

702
00:50:07.197 --> 00:50:09.103
- But honey. we can take care of you.

703
00:50:09.103 --> 00:50:09.936
- [Bench Woman] Help you!

704
00:50:09.936 --> 00:50:10.800
- [Shower Woman] Heal you!

705
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.100
- No. not now!

706
00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.380
Don't move. I've got my gloves here.

707
00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.560
- No. please don't...

708
00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:18.550
- I'm gonna have to put them
on if you don't calm down.

709
00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:19.870
- Felix. come on. you can't.

710
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:23.517
- Yes I can and I have a wetsuit too.

711
00:50:23.517 --> 00:50:24.400
- [Shower Woman] Felix no!

712
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.410
- Yes I do.

713
00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:27.490
As a matter of fact. I'm gonna take it out

714
00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:29.060
and put it on right now.

715
00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:32.170
- We treated you like we have
never treated any other man.

716
00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:33.047
- Yeah.

717
00:50:33.047 --> 00:50:34.480
- We want you!

718
00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:35.313
- We need you!

719
00:50:35.313 --> 00:50:36.940
- Then. don't waste me!

720
00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:39.700
I'm just real tired right now.

721
00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.000
I'm going through
something completely new.

722
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.950
something strange and
wild but also - beautiful!

723
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:50.430
It's. YOU are beautiful

724
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:53.380
but don't pour your beauty
all over me all the time

725
00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:57.630
'cause...'cause I'm really
drowning from... love.

726
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:59.760
At first it just got me wet all over

727
00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.970
but now it's coming up to my mouth

728
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.980
and I see it rising and
my throat gets tight.

729
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.080
I...I...

730
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:11.560
Please! Just give me a
break to recover some energy

731
00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:15.360
and time to understand all of this. okay?

732
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.560
- Okay. fair enough.

733
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.080
You take your rest. see you tomorrow.

734
00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.019
- Bye for now. honey.

735
00:51:23.019 --> 00:51:24.869
- Take care of yourself. darling.

736
00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:27.511
- Get a good night's
sleep and in the morning.

737
00:51:27.511 --> 00:51:29.363
you'll be up again. stronger than ever.

738
00:51:32.477 --> 00:51:35.778
(smooth jazz music)

739
00:51:35.778 --> 00:51:39.080
- Aw. that is so cute!

740
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.810
Seems like someone
finally got some action.

741
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.938
some rough action.

742
00:51:43.938 --> 00:51:46.473
(chuckles) You look
like you've been fucked.

743
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.480
Didn't sleep much last night?

744
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.800
- [Felix] Not really.

745
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.640
- What do you mean "not really"?

746
00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.690
What happened to you?

747
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:57.323
- Nothing. just hung out
with a couple of friends.

748
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.313
- Female friends? (laughs)

749
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.420
- Yeah.

750
00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:09.880
- Oh well. that is something else. huh?

751
00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.120
Somebody's finally gotten the
gist of it. ay? (chuckles)

752
00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.903
Well. congratulations. man.

753
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.390
Oh...

754
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:25.543
It looks like your little
fling has just shown up.

755
00:52:28.118 --> 00:52:30.200
- Felix! Felix...Felix!

756
00:52:32.456 --> 00:52:35.788
- And she brought a friend. (chuckles)

757
00:52:35.788 --> 00:52:37.550
- Let me go. you bastard!

758
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.517
(all three acquaintances
shouting in background)

759
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.260
- And another.

760
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.724
You...Wait a minute! How
many did you say that you...?

761
00:52:47.724 --> 00:52:49.680
- Well. I'm experimenting
a bit at the moment.

762
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.587
Can't really keep count. you know?

763
00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:57.150
- Oh. and where did you say that

764
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:59.859
you met all of these new...friends?

765
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:04.140
- I picked them up yesterday.

766
00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:07.140
They were running from your apartment.

767
00:53:12.761 --> 00:53:15.944
- Felix. wait a second!
- Baby. wait!

768
00:53:15.944 --> 00:53:18.454
- Felix. Felix!

769
00:53:24.782 --> 00:53:27.532
(doorbell ring)

770
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:35.910
- Hello. my name is Felix Blythe.

771
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.510
Professor Jones is expecting me.

772
00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.260
- [Professor Jones] Has the
young gentleman arrived?

773
00:54:37.027 --> 00:54:39.694
(dish shattering)

774
00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.290
- Hello Professor Jones. My
name is Blythe. Felix Blythe.

775
00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:51.560
We talked on the phone.

776
00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.160
Thank you very much for receiving
me on such short notice.

777
00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.990
You remember? It's about the curse.

778
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:58.710
- No! No cursing around my house!

779
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:02.120
- Oh. come on. darling!
We're talking cults here.

780
00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:02.953
- Yeah.

781
00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.640
- Welcome. my friend.

782
00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.450
You see. I don't have
many visitors anymore.

783
00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:14.090
Your case just seems fascinating to me.

784
00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:16.980
Come on. I'll show you something.

785
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.860
I've done a little research. Based on

786
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.363
the information you've given me

787
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.860
we find a curse of your kind mentioned

788
00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:30.400
in many different cultures.

789
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.750
as early as 5000 years ago.

790
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:37.450
You see. already the Sumerians complained

791
00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:39.790
about the difficult nature of the female

792
00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:44.790
and the. therefore. complicated
road to procreation.

793
00:55:45.153 --> 00:55:48.220
(suspenseful music)

794
00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:51.400
Legend has it that Uruk. the Smart.

795
00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:56.410
a local businessman of
a south Sumerian tribe

796
00:55:56.410 --> 00:56:00.200
who was in charge of distributing
agricultural products.

797
00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:06.170
got so frustrated with the
famously beautiful Ashihara

798
00:56:06.373 --> 00:56:08.680
and her negative attitude towards

799
00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:12.670
uncomplicated sexual encounters.

800
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:17.562
that he went to his spiritual
advisor Saki for help.

801
00:56:17.562 --> 00:56:20.311
(jovial ominous music)

802
00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:30.710
When confronted with the idea

803
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:33.690
of equipping Uruk with a magic spell

804
00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:37.190
that would enable him
to have physical access

805
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:42.190
to any Sumerian lady at
the time of his choosing.

806
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:46.570
the spiritual advisor felt ambivalent.

807
00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:50.370
While being able to relate to the problem.

808
00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:54.640
Saki warned that the power
that comes from the origin

809
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:59.640
of the world must never be
released in its entirety

810
00:56:59.647 --> 00:57:03.123
or mankind was doomed!

811
00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:07.700
One half of nature. he went on to explain.

812
00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:11.040
was to hold the balance by resisting.

813
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:15.040
thereby ensuring the constant development

814
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.953
of the strength of the other half.

815
00:57:18.487 --> 00:57:21.125
Although later scientists concluded that

816
00:57:21.125 --> 00:57:26.125
this euphemistic approach to
human relations in general

817
00:57:27.376 --> 00:57:30.710
and the complicated arousal process

818
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:33.518
of a female in particular

819
00:57:33.518 --> 00:57:38.330
was based on Saki's
lack of amerous success.

820
00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:43.321
the principle of the duality of nature

821
00:57:43.321 --> 00:57:48.321
was supported by great
parts of Sumerian society.

822
00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:52.760
When Uruk insisted that
the fate of the world

823
00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:56.350
was of lesser importance
than his personal success

824
00:57:56.350 --> 00:58:01.350
with women. Saki relented
and prayed to Osku for help.

825
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.460
That night. in his sleep.

826
00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:11.072
he was given a mysterious physical ritual

827
00:58:11.072 --> 00:58:15.820
involving the right
hand moving up and down

828
00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:20.817
in front of one's face
and a magic sentence.

829
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:31.780
The next day he showed the ritual to Uruk.

830
00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:34.793
told him the magic words to go with it

831
00:58:36.352 --> 00:58:37.633
𒀀𒃽𒇗𒂸 𒎍 𒍭

832
00:58:37.633 --> 00:58:39.284
𒀀𒃽𒇗𒂸 𒎍 𒍭.

833
00:58:39.284 --> 00:58:41.850
warned him to use it unwisely

834
00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:45.680
and. should he become bereft
of his physical powers.

835
00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.810
to pass it on to somebody else -

836
00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:51.403
the same way he had acquired it.

837
00:58:57.481 --> 00:59:01.040
Uruk is believed to have
died of a heart attack

838
00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:04.290
after a long and fierce alimony battle

839
00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:07.603
over his last 14 children with Ashihara.

840
00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:16.280
Over the course of the next 5000 years

841
00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:19.240
this legend showed up in many different

842
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.016
cultures all over the world.

843
00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:25.870
Famous people identified
as potential bearers

844
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:30.870
of the curse were Casanova.
Don Juan and The Beatles.

845
00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:34.910
Though nothing could ever be verified

846
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:37.120
beyond reasonable doubt.

847
00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:41.200
- Wow. so at least I'm
following a long tradition.

848
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.500
Well. Professor. thank you
very much for your help.

849
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.980
I've already taken up enough
of your precious time.

850
00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:46.813
- Don't mention it.

851
00:59:46.813 --> 00:59:48.874
- Goodbye.
- It's been a pleasure.

852
00:59:56.702 --> 00:59:59.160
(Ron rustles through the bushes)

853
01:00:05.985 --> 01:00:07.918
- We must get bigger.

854
01:00:07.918 --> 01:00:09.720
This can only be the beginning.

855
01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:14.410
We must organise seminars
in every town. every country

856
01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:16.843
and on every continent in the world!

857
01:00:16.843 --> 01:00:20.556
- (chuckles) Yes and
in every province too.

858
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:23.063
- That's included. you idiot.

859
01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.280
- Oh. you...you mean.
they don't have to pay?

860
01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.800
- No! When I'm talking
about every country.

861
01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.640
then every province is included

862
01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.400
and when I'm talking
about every continent.

863
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.531
then every country is incl...

864
01:00:35.597 --> 01:00:38.938
(Felix's frantic female
followers follow Felix)

865
01:00:42.107 --> 01:00:45.011
That's a completely new concept!

866
01:00:45.011 --> 01:00:48.260
- Bu...but that's the guy from our show.

867
01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.712
- What guy?

868
01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:51.183
- The loser?

869
01:00:51.183 --> 01:00:53.080
- The...Why? What?

870
01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.296
- The guy you told Amalia

871
01:00:54.296 --> 01:00:56.060
to make look stupid.

872
01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.338
- Oh. that guy.

873
01:00:58.338 --> 01:01:00.579
He must have learned something then.

874
01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.204
Do you think he got all
of that from our seminar?

875
01:01:05.204 --> 01:01:09.614
- (laughs) No. of course not!

876
01:01:10.821 --> 01:01:12.156
(crescendo music)

877
01:01:13.305 --> 01:01:15.606
(a minor touch sax music)

878
01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:20.824
Boss!

879
01:01:24.067 --> 01:01:26.120
I'm so sorry!

880
01:01:54.575 --> 01:01:56.225
- Hi. cowboy!

881
01:01:56.225 --> 01:01:58.500
I hear you're getting
mighty popular around here.

882
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.400
- Well. I try my best.

883
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.360
I'm just a bit stressed out lately.

884
01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.195
Too much work. you know.

885
01:02:04.195 --> 01:02:05.840
- That's not what I'm hearing.

886
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:07.530
They say you're the new ladies man

887
01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:10.667
that gets all the juices flowing.

888
01:02:11.536 --> 01:02:13.280
So you better listen up boy.

889
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.780
'cause it's not working with me.

890
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.209
I'm all dried up on you. You
couldn't squeeze it in there

891
01:02:17.209 --> 01:02:19.737
if you had put it in milk before.

892
01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:26.125
(Jane moans sensually)

893
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:34.435
- So. is there anything else you need?

894
01:02:34.435 --> 01:02:38.245
- I need you. Ah. I need you!

895
01:02:38.245 --> 01:02:42.531
I need you to go to Ron's
office. He wants to talk to ya.

896
01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:44.623
Mm.

897
01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:48.970
Ooh. nice.

898
01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:52.336
Nice talking to you Felix.

899
01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:54.528
We should really do this more often.

900
01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:58.513
(Jane moans sensually)

901
01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:03.985
(smooth jazz music)

902
01:03:03.985 --> 01:03:04.818
(door knocking)

903
01:03:04.818 --> 01:03:05.759
- Come in.

904
01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.250
Good to see you.

905
01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:12.880
Very good to see you. How are you?

906
01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.236
- [Felix] I'm okay.

907
01:03:14.236 --> 01:03:17.347
- (chuckles) But it's
more than that. isn't it?

908
01:03:17.347 --> 01:03:21.080
You're doing absolutely great.

909
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:26.080
I mean. look at you! You're
the talk of the town.

910
01:03:26.164 --> 01:03:31.164
Your touch with the ladies
just seems to be special -

911
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:33.893
really special!

912
01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:39.240
Actually. I think I might
have underestimated you

913
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.540
in that respect a bit.

914
01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.120
I know you've been a good
sport with the jokes and all

915
01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.870
but this really surprises me.

916
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:53.840
Anyway. since you've obviously developed

917
01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.946
quite a bit of charisma lately.

918
01:03:56.946 --> 01:04:00.175
I think we need to look at your position.

919
01:04:01.101 --> 01:04:02.545
- My position?

920
01:04:02.545 --> 01:04:05.501
- Your position in our company.

921
01:04:05.501 --> 01:04:08.212
We always have advanced positions for guys

922
01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:10.730
who have a hand with the ladies.

923
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.467
- Well. I don't know. I'm
a little tired lately and

924
01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.116
I don't know if I could...

925
01:04:18.116 --> 01:04:19.691
- Sure you can!

926
01:04:21.707 --> 01:04:24.472
A certain someone that I
know is very special to you

927
01:04:24.472 --> 01:04:27.160
will be here any minute

928
01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.490
and then we're gonna talk
about your future. my friend.

929
01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:34.600
because with your talent and my ideas.

930
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.190
we could really go places.

931
01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:41.620
But first I gotta show you something.

932
01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.319
This is really cool.

933
01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:53.180
- [Felix] What's that for?

934
01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:58.121
- Well. hop in for a second and
you'll understand...partner!

935
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:11.963
Good. now just put your hand
up through that hole there.

936
01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.803
There you go.

937
01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:26.810
It adds a special
stimulation that never fails.

938
01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:28.923
Satisfaction guaranteed!

939
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:34.970
And it was actually
constructed with you in mind

940
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:37.291
to better channel your talents.

941
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:40.644
- Wait.

942
01:05:40.644 --> 01:05:42.430
F...Get me the fuck out of here!

943
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:44.880
- [Ron] You said you needed a rest.

944
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.900
- Open the fucking board!

945
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:49.120
- [Ron] Relax! If you wanna make the most

946
01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.770
out of your talent. you
need to learn how to focus.

947
01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:54.994
- Ron. I know you're a
bit of a joker and all

948
01:05:54.994 --> 01:05:57.330
but th...this is really not nice!

949
01:05:57.330 --> 01:05:58.239
I...

950
01:05:58.239 --> 01:05:59.072
(door knocking)

951
01:05:59.072 --> 01:05:59.973
- Here she comes.

952
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:05.370
If you even think about making a sound.

953
01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:06.820
you can forget about your job

954
01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:10.810
and now relax. buddy.

955
01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:12.563
You said you like experiments.

956
01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.015
Come in.

957
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:22.080
- Be careful. you're going
down a very slippery road.

958
01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.890
- Oh. well. Maybe I like
it a little slippery.

959
01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:28.660
- Please. cut it out or you will slip.

960
01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.200
fall and never get up again.

961
01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:38.150
So. the campaign? What about the poster?

962
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:40.107
- Right. well...

963
01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:45.700
It so happens that we have

964
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.120
an image for you.

965
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.633
This is our first attempt.
What do you think?

966
01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:59.810
- Hmm. well it's a little basic

967
01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:02.385
but I'm sure Jamie will like it.

968
01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:04.252
- Hmm

969
01:07:04.252 --> 01:07:06.860
and well. what about you?

970
01:07:09.124 --> 01:07:10.541
What do you like?

971
01:07:13.454 --> 01:07:15.643
Do you like if I touch you?

972
01:07:15.643 --> 01:07:18.465
(Sarah moans sensually)

973
01:07:18.465 --> 01:07:20.015
Hm. you do!

974
01:07:26.951 --> 01:07:28.118
That's better.

975
01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.673
- [Sarah] Oh yes!

(No Nonsense News Theme)

1008
01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:00.380
- Good morning. Ladies and Gentlemen.

1009
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:02.580
A formerly unknown advertising agent

1010
01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.610
by the name of Felix Blythe

1011
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:06.540
has made the headlines today.

1012
01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:09.400
because he was frequently
seen all over town

1013
01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.810
running away from a group
of infatuated women.

1014
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:15.760
Because of his profession.
different media analysts

1015
01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.100
have commented that this might be linked

1016
01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.420
to a campaign of some sorts.

1017
01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:23.640
but Surrey's International.
the agency the young man

1018
01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.170
is working for. has denied any connection.

1019
01:11:27.170 --> 01:11:30.320
although a representative
uttered a statement

1020
01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:33.180
saying that they will utter a statement

1021
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.940
when and if anything will have to be

1022
01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:38.460
stated or uttered at all.

1023
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.310
Of course. we are watching
this development for you.

1024
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:43.318
Henry Clowell has the latest.

1025
01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:47.330
- Tim. I'm waiting here
in the beautiful West Park

1026
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:50.230
of the city where Felix
Blythe. the media phenomenon.

1027
01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:52.520
is said to pass by on a regular basis.

1028
01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.120
It's all quiet right now but I can still

1029
01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.560
see remnants of last night's events

1030
01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.080
when. as one of our secret
sources has revealed.

1031
01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:02.330
a Roman orgy must have been taking place.

1032
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:04.123
Well. let's see.

1033
01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:10.104
Here are some pieces of clothing.

1034
01:12:10.104 --> 01:12:12.350
(Felix's frantic female
followers follow Felix)

1035
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:14.225
Oh. I think they're coming.

1036
01:12:14.225 --> 01:12:19.223
(Felix's frantic female
follower's fawning)

1037
01:12:19.223 --> 01:12:21.230
(sinister music)

1038
01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:24.370
- Geez. look at this!
That is one lucky bastard

1039
01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:26.893
and he's so fast.

1040
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.090
- He's used to that by now.

1041
01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:30.923
- What's that?

1042
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.210
- He's become quite fast.

1043
01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:36.375
that's 'cause he's got a lot of exercise.

1044
01:12:36.375 --> 01:12:38.480
- Do you know him?

1045
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.511
I think I know him.

1046
01:12:40.511 --> 01:12:42.070
His face looks familiar.

1047
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:43.746
- He works for us.

1048
01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:50.242
- But why is he doing all that running?

1049
01:12:50.242 --> 01:12:51.370
- He has to.

1050
01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:52.203
- [Jamie] Why?

1051
01:12:52.203 --> 01:12:53.470
- 'Cause they're after him.

1052
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:57.670
- Sure. but why doesn't he just enjoy?

1053
01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:00.512
- Oh. he has but now
he's a little used up.

1054
01:13:00.512 --> 01:13:02.333
Doesn't have that much anymore.

1055
01:13:02.333 --> 01:13:05.060
- (chuckles) You mean.
he's running out of...

1056
01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:08.300
- Yeah and he wants to
save the last bits for me.

1057
01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.030
Anyway. if you're interested
in the guy. you're set

1058
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:14.768
'cause Ron's already on him
investigating everything.

1059
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.540
The thing with Felix. you
don't think there's anything

1060
01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:23.540
special at first but when he
touches ya. something happens.

1061
01:13:24.449 --> 01:13:29.449
an explosion. eruption. so
massive and unbelievable!

1062
01:13:30.316 --> 01:13:33.064
Well anyway. get me Ron!

1063
01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.978
I'll need this runner.

1064
01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:39.647
He will lead the chick
vote my way. (chuckles)

1065
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:43.270
- I'm gonna try to catch up with him.

1066
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:45.000
maybe I can get an interview.

1067
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.730
(menacing music)

1068
01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:49.527
- That's Felix!

1069
01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:53.540
He was so calm when he was here.

1070
01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:56.353
He's changed so much since he's been gone.

1071
01:13:56.353 --> 01:13:57.650
- Excuse me. sir.

1072
01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:58.483
- What is it?

1073
01:13:58.483 --> 01:14:00.780
- Why is it that all these
women are following you?

1074
01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.810
- It's 'cause they like me
in a certain physical way.

1075
01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:05.610
That's somewhat hard to explain.

1076
01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:07.900
I just wanna state that I
can't be held responsible

1077
01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.970
or at least not solely responsible.

1078
01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:12.190
You see. I didn't ask for any of this.

1079
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.113
Well. not in so many words.

1080
01:14:14.113 --> 01:14:15.520
Okay. I might have wished
for something to change

1081
01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.360
but I never expected anything like this.

1082
01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.470
- Okay. one more question. sir.

1083
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:21.040
- No. gotta run!

1084
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.572
- Okay. but maybe you. young lady.

1085
01:14:22.572 --> 01:14:23.500
- [young woman] Yah.

1086
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.970
- So. how long have you been
involved in this enterprise?

1087
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:27.290
- Not so long.

1088
01:14:28.469 --> 01:14:29.987
- What's this all about?

1089
01:14:29.987 --> 01:14:32.472
- It's just so nice when he touches you.

1090
01:14:32.472 --> 01:14:33.810
- When he touches you?
- Yes.

1091
01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:35.660
- Under what conditions and where?

1092
01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:37.487
- I don't know. I just heard it's special

1093
01:14:37.487 --> 01:14:39.500
and all my friends are here as well.

1094
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:45.830
- Well. Tim. I think we're
just...just running out of time.

1095
01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.910
- No. actually we are not. Henry.

1096
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:52.070
Can you maybe try to speak to someone

1097
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:53.820
who has had contact to him?

1098
01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.663
- Thou shall not make women follow.

1099
01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.440
- He doesn't.

1100
01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:03.020
They just follow him anyway.

1101
01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:05.520
- And how would you know. Sarita?

1102
01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.880
- I saw him.

1103
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.350
He didn't do anything
to MAKE them follow him.

1104
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:11.537
They WANT to follow!

1105
01:15:11.537 --> 01:15:14.231
- And why is that. I wonder?

1106
01:15:14.231 --> 01:15:17.112
- Maybe he's got healing hands?

1107
01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:18.710
- Healing hands?

1108
01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:21.020
What are you trying to say?

1109
01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:24.172
- Well. it's...

1110
01:15:24.172 --> 01:15:26.040
He touches women.

1111
01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.378
- Thou shall not touch!

1112
01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.610
- Elena. have you been
following these people?

1113
01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:35.120
You know they're not pure in heart.

1114
01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.890
just stay away from them.

1115
01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:40.030
Did you enter their sphere?

1116
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:42.923
- No. I was far away.

1117
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:46.596
- Did Felix touch you?

1118
01:15:46.596 --> 01:15:47.913
- No!

1119
01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:50.461
Sarita?

1120
01:15:53.867 --> 01:15:55.767
Sarita?

1121
01:15:55.767 --> 01:16:00.761
- Only he may touch
from within and without.

1122
01:16:00.761 --> 01:16:05.273
- It is said that only he
may touch but who is he?

1123
01:16:05.273 --> 01:16:09.980
(Sarita's redemption music)

1124
01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:24.297
- We know that Sarita. He is our savior.

1125
01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:28.344
- What if he's really someone else?

1126
01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:35.332
- When did you have your last
consultation with our savior?

1127
01:16:35.332 --> 01:16:38.179
- About a week ago.

1128
01:16:38.179 --> 01:16:40.726
- And what did he tell you?

1129
01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:44.224
- That I must look for the light...in him.

1130
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:46.183
- Yes!

1131
01:16:48.035 --> 01:16:51.118
Because right now. you
don't see the light.

1132
01:16:51.118 --> 01:16:52.453
You live in darkness

1133
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.060
and he who does not see. must feel!

1134
01:17:01.019 --> 01:17:03.836
(menacing music)

1135
01:17:09.029 --> 01:17:11.289
(whip cracking. Sarita screams)

1136
01:17:11.289 --> 01:17:14.180
(Felix's frantic female
followers flaunting)

1137
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:17.750
- So. and as Felix's
frantic female followers

1138
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:21.253
have dispersed a bit. it's time
to analyze this phenomenon.

1139
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:26.760
Sir. sir! As an avid
connoisseur of media sensations.

1140
01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:27.984
what's your perception?

1141
01:17:27.984 --> 01:17:29.444
- [Follower] He's sitting on that bench.

1142
01:17:29.444 --> 01:17:30.635
- Please. sir.

1143
01:17:30.635 --> 01:17:31.543
Sir!

1144
01:17:31.543 --> 01:17:33.527
The public has a right to know.

1145
01:17:35.936 --> 01:17:38.578
(Felix's frantic female followers flip)

1146
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:45.245
And as we continue our broadcast...

1147
01:17:49.509 --> 01:17:52.299
(smooth jazz music)

1148
01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:59.532
- Faith and family frame our...?

1149
01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:04.544
He just won't accept anything more modern.

1150
01:18:06.213 --> 01:18:08.014
Nothing light and fun!

1151
01:18:08.014 --> 01:18:11.469
He always wants to fight some evil forces

1152
01:18:11.469 --> 01:18:14.902
or cleanse our hearts and souls!

1153
01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.520
Where is the attraction?
Where is the MAGIC?

1154
01:18:22.283 --> 01:18:24.008
(Felix's frantic female followers flock

1155
01:18:26.230 --> 01:18:28.232
That's Felix!

1156
01:18:28.232 --> 01:18:29.065
What the...?

1157
01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:31.705
It's turned into an epidemic...

1158
01:18:33.158 --> 01:18:34.945
and he's running away from it.

1159
01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:38.850
Ah. that poor bastard
wouldn't know his destiny

1160
01:18:38.850 --> 01:18:40.882
if it slapped him in the face.

1161
01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:42.868
What a waste!

1162
01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:47.750
I will see to it that this strange gift

1163
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:50.770
finds a more deserved bearer.

1164
01:18:55.387 --> 01:18:58.375
(Felix's frantic female followers flood)

1165
01:18:58.375 --> 01:19:00.915
- That's him! He's still at it.

1166
01:19:02.045 --> 01:19:04.429
(Felix's frantic female
followers flabbergast)

1167
01:19:07.857 --> 01:19:09.910
- Sorry. sorry. ma'am.
I just want to ask YOU

1168
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:11.338
what this is all about.

1169
01:19:11.338 --> 01:19:13.367
- It's about him and
what he does to women.

1170
01:19:13.367 --> 01:19:15.402
- Well. what is it exactly
that he does to them?

1171
01:19:15.402 --> 01:19:17.323
- He lets us live! He makes us feel!

1172
01:19:17.323 --> 01:19:20.510
He makes us see the light!

1173
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:22.780
- He has a way with women.

1174
01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:24.967
How come you didn't see that?

1175
01:19:24.967 --> 01:19:26.820
- Well. he was our idiot.

1176
01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:29.553
- No. YOU are our idiot!

1177
01:19:29.553 --> 01:19:32.761
He's really going for it now.

1178
01:19:32.761 --> 01:19:34.686
I put him down in the show.

1179
01:19:34.686 --> 01:19:37.800
That must have helped
him build up self esteem!

1180
01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.130
Remember when I put you down?

1181
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:41.640
- Which time?

1182
01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.710
- Last year. when your avalanche

1183
01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:46.330
of stupidity ruined my seminar!

1184
01:19:46.330 --> 01:19:47.163
- When did I...?

1185
01:19:47.163 --> 01:19:48.470
- Ah. shut up!

1186
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:51.110
I'm speaking metaphorically here.

1187
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:53.338
I don't have to give any examples.

1188
01:19:53.338 --> 01:19:56.521
Everybody knows about your
constant mistakes anyway.

1189
01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:00.270
What did it feel like when I told you off

1190
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:02.211
in front of the whole audience?

1191
01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:06.616
- It felt just...just like...

1192
01:20:06.616 --> 01:20:08.610
- It motivated you!

1193
01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:11.423
You messed up a little less afterwards.

1194
01:20:11.423 --> 01:20:14.770
So. what happens when you put people down?

1195
01:20:14.770 --> 01:20:15.603
- [Sidekick] They feel...

1196
01:20:15.603 --> 01:20:16.436
- Yes?

1197
01:20:16.436 --> 01:20:17.269
- [Sidekick] They feel just...

1198
01:20:17.269 --> 01:20:19.053
- They catapult right up again.

1199
01:20:19.053 --> 01:20:22.794
It's pure physics! You put
pressure on their heads

1200
01:20:22.794 --> 01:20:24.953
and then they jump back higher and higher.

1201
01:20:27.393 --> 01:20:29.798
- Well. Tim. It seems to be
about life. feelings and light.

1202
01:20:29.798 --> 01:20:32.317
- I'm gotta get him and
then I squeeze it out of him

1203
01:20:32.317 --> 01:20:35.170
and then I have it and
I intend to keep it.

1204
01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:37.400
- But where does the light come from?

1205
01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.923
- From within! Deep deep within!

1206
01:20:41.010 --> 01:20:44.041
- Henry! Are you...are you all right?

1207
01:20:44.041 --> 01:20:46.497
- Yes of course. I'm just
so thrilled to be able

1208
01:20:46.497 --> 01:20:48.850
to report to you that a
new light has been detected

1209
01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:52.240
that only a few men are
able to see or to produce.

1210
01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:55.307
Tim. I can't wait to tell
my wife when I get home.

1211
01:20:58.570 --> 01:21:00.990
Oh. Honey. wait. Wait!

1212
01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:05.452
- This time. we have to plan
everything thoroughly...

1213
01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.080
So I better do it myself.

1214
01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.277
It's important!

1215
01:21:11.126 --> 01:21:15.650
Do you remember what I always
do when I'm planning anything?

1216
01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:16.930
- Yes.

1217
01:21:16.930 --> 01:21:20.440
You overlook everything.
and you oversee nothing.

1218
01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.392
- Exactly. I over...

1219
01:21:24.381 --> 01:21:25.306
You idiot!

1220
01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:31.720
- Well. thank you very much
Henry and good luck...at home.

1221
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:34.860
And now to our next topic:

1222
01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:36.860
Candidate for Governor James Walker

1223
01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:39.750
is linked to the infamous
Sisters of Light cult

1224
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:41.610
through his wife Sarah.

1225
01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:43.510
who. an informant has told us.

1226
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:47.100
secretly holds a high
position in the cult.

1227
01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:51.000
Surrey's International.
responsible for Walker's campaign.

1228
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.330
did not comment directly

1229
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:56.640
but their spokesperson and
junior campaign organizer

1230
01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.810
Ron Wentworth said on a more general note

1231
01:21:59.810 --> 01:22:01.810
that Walker was a firm believer

1232
01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:04.950
in religious freedom
and cultural diversity

1233
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:07.150
and that everybody was presumed innocent

1234
01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:09.510
until proven guilty.

1235
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:12.487
Although he hadn't done
anything and quote:

1236
01:22:12.487 --> 01:22:14.900
"Of course. our next Governor Walker

1237
01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:18.370
follows a zero tolerance policy on crime

1238
01:22:18.370 --> 01:22:21.622
and. moreover. strongly
denies any professional

1239
01:22:21.622 --> 01:22:24.255
or private relations to his wife."

1240
01:22:27.013 --> 01:22:27.847
(hand smack)

1241
01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:39.698
- Hi.

1242
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:43.198
- Okay. hi then.

1243
01:22:48.650 --> 01:22:50.817
- Not many women around here. right?

1244
01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.525
- Doesn't look like it.

1245
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:58.070
- Well. and even if there were.

1246
01:22:58.070 --> 01:23:00.190
it probably wouldn't be
easy to talk to them.

1247
01:23:00.190 --> 01:23:01.140
- Look. I...

1248
01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.500
- I know how to do that.

1249
01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.100
- Do what?

1250
01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:06.483
- Come on to women.

1251
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.929
- Good for you. my friend.
but I really don't...

1252
01:23:09.929 --> 01:23:11.886
- I'm willing to share my secret with you.

1253
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:16.480
- Ah. just get the fuck
away from me. you loony!

1254
01:23:19.919 --> 01:23:23.836
(patrons talking in background)

1255
01:23:34.450 --> 01:23:36.060
- Nice bar. hmm?

1256
01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.094
- [Patron] Can't say it wasn't.

1257
01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.955
- If only there were some women.

1258
01:23:41.955 --> 01:23:43.780
- There were.

1259
01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:45.760
- Oh yeah. when?

1260
01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:48.003
- About 1975!

1261
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:51.733
- Say what?

1262
01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:55.978
- That was a good year for me. 1975.

1263
01:23:56.850 --> 01:23:59.020
- 1975?

1264
01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:01.300
Warm summer that year?

1265
01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.550
- No. not particularly.

1266
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:07.113
It just all fell into its right
place for once in my life.

1267
01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.659
- Waiter. just get this man
a double whiskey. please.

1268
01:24:15.659 --> 01:24:17.660
- [Waiter] Sure mate.

1269
01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:19.243
- Appreciate it. son.

1270
01:24:20.289 --> 01:24:22.431
(patrons still talking in background)

1271
01:24:27.601 --> 01:24:30.601
(upbeat jazz music)

1272
01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.938
- Sorry man. this is
not what I do. Come on!

1273
01:24:54.698 --> 01:24:56.285
- What's he doing?

1274
01:24:56.285 --> 01:24:58.207
There are no women around.

1275
01:24:58.207 --> 01:24:59.965
- I think he wants to avoid them.

1276
01:24:59.965 --> 01:25:01.530
- Avoid them?

1277
01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:02.786
But why?

1278
01:25:04.530 --> 01:25:07.320
Do you hear that strange music?

1279
01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:08.870
- Sure.

1280
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:10.514
Why?

1281
01:25:10.514 --> 01:25:12.686
- It sounds like they're mocking someone.

1282
01:25:12.686 --> 01:25:13.519
- Through the music?

1283
01:25:13.519 --> 01:25:14.361
- Yes. through the music.

1284
01:25:14.361 --> 01:25:15.277
- But how can they...

1285
01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:17.342
- Shut up. you're not aware.

1286
01:25:17.342 --> 01:25:21.250
There's something
happening on another level.

1287
01:25:23.148 --> 01:25:24.500
- If you could have all
the women you wanted.

1288
01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:25.537
would you go for it?

1289
01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:27.167
(Felix's frantic female
followers fandangoing)

1290
01:25:27.167 --> 01:25:28.000
- Are you kidding me?

1291
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:28.833
Sure man!

1292
01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:30.390
- [Felix] Let's just do
this little game. okay?

1293
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:31.290
Bear with me for a second.

1294
01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:32.780
- Okay. whatever you say.

1295
01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:34.327
- To get that woman you want...

1296
01:25:34.327 --> 01:25:35.730
- But wait a minute. you said I could have

1297
01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.399
ALL the women I want.

1298
01:25:37.399 --> 01:25:40.039
(staccato music/celeste version)

1299
01:25:40.039 --> 01:25:43.531
(Jane moans sensually)

1300
01:25:45.777 --> 01:25:47.067
One after another!

1301
01:25:47.067 --> 01:25:49.970
- Oh. Felix!
(Shower Woman moans sensually)

1302
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:51.050
- [Felix] Sure. but you have to...

1303
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:53.737
- That means. I can also have
some of them at the same time!

1304
01:25:53.737 --> 01:25:55.710
(staccato music/celeste version)

1305
01:25:55.710 --> 01:25:57.270
- Everything you want but you have to do

1306
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:58.103
this little routine.

1307
01:25:58.103 --> 01:25:59.195
- Okay.

1308
01:25:59.195 --> 01:26:01.596
(staccato music/celeste version)

1309
01:26:03.090 --> 01:26:05.060
You are crazy. man. this is crazy.

1310
01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.887
This is absolutely crazy.
I like you. I really do.

1311
01:26:06.887 --> 01:26:09.410
- Na...Now say that you understand
that having all the women

1312
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:11.426
in the world might also cause trouble.

1313
01:26:11.426 --> 01:26:13.350
(staccato music/celeste version)

1314
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:14.190
- No.

1315
01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:15.113
- Why not?

1316
01:26:15.113 --> 01:26:15.946
- Because that's not true.

1317
01:26:15.946 --> 01:26:16.826
- That's just the game!

1318
01:26:16.826 --> 01:26:18.110
- [Another Young Guy]
Well. I guess I might not

1319
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:19.470
like this game too much anymore. man.

1320
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:22.050
- No please. hang in
there! I have it. you know?

1321
01:26:22.050 --> 01:26:22.883
- You have what?

1322
01:26:22.883 --> 01:26:27.055
- The magical touch that
makes all the women go crazy.

1323
01:26:27.055 --> 01:26:28.567
(Jane moans sensually)

1324
01:26:28.567 --> 01:26:29.420
- [Another Young Guy] No. you don't!

1325
01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:30.750
- Let's just say that I do

1326
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:32.055
and that I am willing to give it to you.

1327
01:26:32.055 --> 01:26:32.970
- [Another Young Guy] But
who in their right mind

1328
01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:33.804
would ever give that away?

1329
01:26:36.307 --> 01:26:37.838
- Well. let's just say that I'm not!

1330
01:26:37.838 --> 01:26:38.671
- [Another Young Guy] You're not what?

1331
01:26:38.671 --> 01:26:39.934
- In my right mind.

1332
01:26:39.934 --> 01:26:40.775
- [Another Young Guy] Well.
that's for sure. mate.

1333
01:26:40.775 --> 01:26:42.946
- Dance. just dance! Do the dance!

1334
01:26:42.946 --> 01:26:45.490
(upbeat jazz music)

1335
01:26:45.490 --> 01:26:47.020
And if you want it. you gotta say...

1336
01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.830
- Can I please have it?

1337
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:50.030
- No!

1338
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:51.357
Give it to me!

1339
01:26:51.357 --> 01:26:52.200
- [Another Young Guy] What?

1340
01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.237
- [Felix] You gotta say: "Give it to me"!

1341
01:26:54.237 --> 01:26:57.775
(upbeat jazz music)

1342
01:26:57.775 --> 01:26:59.226
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1343
01:26:59.226 --> 01:27:00.687
- Now. what is he up to?

1344
01:27:00.687 --> 01:27:02.937
- I think he's defending his territory.

1345
01:27:02.937 --> 01:27:04.640
This strange little dance reminds me

1346
01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.626
of something from way back when

1347
01:27:06.626 --> 01:27:08.700
but I can't put my hand on it.

1348
01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:09.810
- Your finger. sir.

1349
01:27:09.810 --> 01:27:10.700
- What?

1350
01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:12.307
- You cannot put your
finger on it. not your...

1351
01:27:12.307 --> 01:27:15.055
- How the Hell would YOU know
what I'm putting on anything?

1352
01:27:15.055 --> 01:27:18.784
(a minor touch sax music)

1353
01:27:18.784 --> 01:27:22.340
- Come on. give it to me.
give it to me. come on.

1354
01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:24.025
Give it...Give it to me.

1355
01:27:24.025 --> 01:27:25.350
Give it to me!

1356
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:27.094
C'mon. give it to me.

1357
01:27:27.094 --> 01:27:27.968
Give it to me.

1358
01:27:27.968 --> 01:27:29.279
Give it to me.

1359
01:27:29.279 --> 01:27:30.970
Give it to me.

1360
01:27:38.976 --> 01:27:40.060
- [Jamie] Where have you been?

1361
01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:41.860
You oughta be working!

1362
01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.520
- Oh. I am. I am.

1363
01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:48.550
I have come up with something
very. very interesting.

1364
01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:53.490
My investigation team has found a way

1365
01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:57.460
to directly enhance the
attractiveness of a candidate.

1366
01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:59.630
- Cut the bullshit. Ron!
I know what this is about.

1367
01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:02.660
The crazy guy who's got the
chicks on his ass works for you.

1368
01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:05.565
- Yeah. well. we're in the
process of discovering...

1369
01:28:05.565 --> 01:28:07.610
- Get him now!

1370
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:11.670
- Oh. so you want him to work for you?

1371
01:28:11.670 --> 01:28:14.740
- No. I want what he has to work for me.

1372
01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.556
just like it did for him.

1373
01:28:18.571 --> 01:28:23.424
- Well. I think we should be
able to come to an agreement.

1374
01:28:23.424 --> 01:28:25.470
Ah...I'll tell you what I've discovered.

1375
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:27.402
You may consider it a little strange.

1376
01:28:27.402 --> 01:28:28.637
- Ah. I don't care!

1377
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:31.997
What do I have to do?

1378
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:34.291
- It's something with the hands.

1379
01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:37.243
It goes...

1380
01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:44.868
- Really?

1381
01:28:46.570 --> 01:28:50.050
Well. by the way. you gotta
do something about my wife.

1382
01:28:50.050 --> 01:28:53.235
This little choir group of hers
is getting way out of hand.

1383
01:28:53.235 --> 01:28:55.920
- Oh yeah. well. Mister
Walker. I certainly understand

1384
01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.600
why you're worried about it. ah...

1385
01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.710
but that caught us completely off guard.

1386
01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:01.400
We didn't know about any of the stuff

1387
01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.849
that your wife was into.

1388
01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.760
- Well. since she's not into me anymore

1389
01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:11.410
or I into her or in her
or around her that much.

1390
01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:13.600
I've kinda lost track of these things.

1391
01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.381
I am busy. you know!

1392
01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:21.510
She's always had that spiritual side

1393
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:24.162
and now it has turned into a cult.

1394
01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:29.803
So. what are we going to do about it?

1395
01:29:32.594 --> 01:29:33.660
- I. ah...

1396
01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.840
I need to think this through

1397
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.450
but I'll come up with something.

1398
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:40.470
- Yeah. something!

1399
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:42.002
It'd better be good this time.

1400
01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:45.908
I want her out!

1401
01:29:47.434 --> 01:29:48.517
(Walker chuckles)

1402
01:30:08.713 --> 01:30:09.765
(hand smack)

1403
01:30:10.757 --> 01:30:12.372
This is not working.

1404
01:30:13.710 --> 01:30:15.713
You've got 24 hours to make it work!

1405
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:21.730
- Sorry. sorry. I...I should have told you

1406
01:30:21.730 --> 01:30:24.110
but Walker is so impatient.

1407
01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:27.130
I didn't have a chance to prepare you.

1408
01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:28.699
- How do you know about the handshake?

1409
01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.400
- Well. I was at the Professor's house

1410
01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.525
underneath the window.

1411
01:30:32.525 --> 01:30:33.818
- You!

1412
01:30:33.818 --> 01:30:37.760
I only wanted to make sure that
you didn't get into trouble.

1413
01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:40.090
I have a responsibility to my inferiors

1414
01:30:40.090 --> 01:30:42.273
that I don't take lightly. Felix.

1415
01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:51.120
Oh. I get it. You're still
angry about last time.

1416
01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:54.410
Well. see I know that you want her

1417
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:56.470
and I gave you the opportunity

1418
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:59.781
for some very intimate moments with her.

1419
01:30:59.781 --> 01:31:01.888
You should be a little more grateful.

1420
01:31:01.888 --> 01:31:03.882
Oh. okay. I understand. Next time

1421
01:31:03.882 --> 01:31:05.680
I'll let you play a more active role.

1422
01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:08.380
But you gotta get this
into your head. Felix:

1423
01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:11.020
You may not always like
the way I do things

1424
01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:13.590
but we're in this together. okay?

1425
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:16.350
Now. I see a very bright future for us.

1426
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:18.793
but we gotta give Walker what he wants

1427
01:31:18.793 --> 01:31:21.430
because that's the only way that

1428
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:23.213
you can live with predators.

1429
01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:28.510
So. ah...If you want this to work out well

1430
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:30.633
for you and with Sarah...

1431
01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:34.093
then you gotta help me!

1432
01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:36.958
So. look. I'll ah...

1433
01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:40.452
be in touch with you Felix!

1434
01:31:40.452 --> 01:31:43.093
Ah...Trust me! This
is...this is gonna be great!

1435
01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.363
- Professor!

1436
01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:52.730
Professor! I'm in a terrible dilemma.

1437
01:31:52.730 --> 01:31:54.530
I really need to lose the curse.

1438
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:56.320
I just can't put up with it any longer

1439
01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.670
but the people who want to have
it are planning to abuse it

1440
01:31:58.670 --> 01:32:00.690
to have power and manipulate.

1441
01:32:00.690 --> 01:32:04.395
- Well. what exactly did you want it for?

1442
01:32:05.462 --> 01:32:09.173
- But that was totally different.
I just wanted to have...

1443
01:32:09.173 --> 01:32:10.006
to enjoy...

1444
01:32:10.006 --> 01:32:11.820
a little...

1445
01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:13.020
I'm not bad.

1446
01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:13.886
you know?

1447
01:32:13.886 --> 01:32:15.870
At least not like them

1448
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:17.508
Please. Professor. you have to help me!

1449
01:32:17.508 --> 01:32:21.051
I was told I must give it to
someone with a pure heart.

1450
01:32:21.051 --> 01:32:24.220
- But that's what I'm here
to talk with you about.

1451
01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.880
If you give it to that kind of person.

1452
01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:30.333
the curse will continue
the way it always has.

1453
01:32:30.333 --> 01:32:32.608
- And if I give it to somebody bad?

1454
01:32:33.542 --> 01:32:38.542
- Well then the so-called
autoreverse effect will kick in.

1455
01:32:40.147 --> 01:32:44.320
- So. I can give it to any
bad person that wants it.

1456
01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:45.990
I'm free and nobody gets hurt

1457
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:48.022
because for him. it just won't work?

1458
01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:53.820
- Believe me. he won't get
anywhere he wants to go to.

1459
01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:56.090
- Are you absolutely sure about this?

1460
01:32:56.090 --> 01:32:58.496
- Of course. I'm a professor!

1461
01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.638
- Then I gotta go. Thank you. Professor!

1462
01:33:06.556 --> 01:33:08.973
(cane thud)

1463
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:22.660
- Forgive me. for I've
failed to see the light.

1464
01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:25.600
- Forgive me. for I've
failed to see the light.

1465
01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.150
- [Nevinovat] Forgive me for I've allowed

1466
01:33:27.150 --> 01:33:29.600
darkness to enter my life.

1467
01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.030
- Forgive me for I've allowed
darkness to enter my life.

1468
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:35.070
- [Nevinovat] I will open up wide

1469
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:36.660
- [Sarita] I will open up wide

1470
01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:39.430
- [Nevinovat] to conceive
the light deep inside.

1471
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:41.807
- [Sarita] to conceive
the light deep inside.

1472
01:33:43.026 --> 01:33:45.776
(menacing music)

1473
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:55.133
- [Sarah] Hi. Felix.

1474
01:33:57.687 --> 01:33:59.680
(Felix's redemption music)

1475
01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:00.513
- Hi.

1476
01:34:01.898 --> 01:34:02.731
Sarah.

1477
01:34:04.316 --> 01:34:07.730
Sarah. you have to watch out.

1478
01:34:07.730 --> 01:34:11.910
Your husband and Ron are
planning to get rid of you.

1479
01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:13.370
- You want to help me?

1480
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:16.290
Oh. that's very sweet of you. darling.

1481
01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:18.640
but don't worry. I've
taken care of everything.

1482
01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.156
- [Felix] They claim you're
in some type of cult.

1483
01:34:23.586 --> 01:34:25.618
(menacing music)

1484
01:34:25.618 --> 01:34:27.877
- You surprised me.

1485
01:34:27.877 --> 01:34:30.000
You surprised all of us.

1486
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.313
What is it with you and your touch?

1487
01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:40.517
May I come in the tub with you?

1488
01:34:56.723 --> 01:35:00.157
Touch me a little. I
wanna feel what it's like!

1489
01:35:06.424 --> 01:35:08.735
But be careful. I don't
wanna lose control!

1490
01:35:14.514 --> 01:35:17.014
(Sarah gasps)

1491
01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:23.503
(Sarah moans)

1492
01:35:29.244 --> 01:35:30.769
Oh. you and I...

1493
01:35:33.434 --> 01:35:34.425
could be...

1494
01:35:36.106 --> 01:35:37.506
successful!

1495
01:35:39.135 --> 01:35:42.302
(Sarah pants heavily)

1496
01:35:52.306 --> 01:35:54.723
(dark fairytale sounds)

1497
01:35:56.794 --> 01:35:59.466
(Sarah coughs)

1498
01:35:59.466 --> 01:36:02.966
(Sarah moans. Her heart beat stops)

1499
01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.203
- Who are you?

1500
01:36:21.203 --> 01:36:25.660
- I am the savior. I bring the light!

1501
01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:29.071
I have always been and I will always be.

1502
01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.310
I am fire and water!

1503
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:33.793
I am...

1504
01:36:38.730 --> 01:36:41.050
Hang on. something is missing.

1505
01:36:42.210 --> 01:36:43.790
- Boss. we need the evil light.

1506
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:45.200
- What?

1507
01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.050
- The evil light!

1508
01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:49.460
- Oh yeah. you're right.
Evil light from below.

1509
01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:50.638
Evil light. please!

1510
01:36:53.235 --> 01:36:55.680
(dark music)

1511
01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:56.540
Where was I?

1512
01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:58.500
Oh yes!

1513
01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:02.048
I am everything and everything is me!

1514
01:37:05.214 --> 01:37:06.940
- But you run self improvement seminars

1515
01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:09.023
and sell penis extenders!

1516
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:18.270
- Well. I gotta have a day
job to keep myself busy

1517
01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.633
and. as a savior.

1518
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:27.530
I need to see to it that I am exposed.

1519
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:30.190
- Exposed to what?

1520
01:37:30.190 --> 01:37:33.480
- To the people! Special
people who want to improve

1521
01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:36.183
themselves. who want to find the way.

1522
01:37:37.210 --> 01:37:39.250
- So. that's why you sell penis extenders?

1523
01:37:39.250 --> 01:37:40.880
- Shut up!

1524
01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:41.713
You're not aware!

1525
01:37:41.713 --> 01:37:42.546
- Of what?

1526
01:37:42.546 --> 01:37:44.555
- Of anything!

1527
01:37:44.555 --> 01:37:47.305
(dark music)

1528
01:37:53.730 --> 01:37:57.948
The only thing you must
know is why you're here.

1529
01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:00.930
- I figured that out.

1530
01:38:00.930 --> 01:38:02.213
You want the curse.

1531
01:38:02.213 --> 01:38:06.301
- I deserve it and it's
only a curse to you.

1532
01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:11.048
To me. it's simply - my destiny!

1533
01:38:13.088 --> 01:38:14.330
- Oh yeah?

1534
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:15.163
- I want it!

1535
01:38:15.163 --> 01:38:15.996
- How badly?

1536
01:38:15.996 --> 01:38:16.829
- I need it!

1537
01:38:16.829 --> 01:38:18.410
- How much?
- Give it to me!

1538
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:19.968
- Okay. you can have it.

1539
01:38:19.968 --> 01:38:22.120
- You will undergo the
most terrible moment

1540
01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:24.230
humans ever had to endure.

1541
01:38:24.230 --> 01:38:26.026
You will face unimagin...ahoua...

1542
01:38:29.198 --> 01:38:30.190
I can have it?

1543
01:38:30.190 --> 01:38:32.290
- Yeah. I'm done with it.

1544
01:38:32.290 --> 01:38:33.870
It was good fun in some ways I guess.

1545
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:36.290
but I'm onto other things now

1546
01:38:36.290 --> 01:38:38.770
but we need to do a
silly handshake routine.

1547
01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:41.067
- Is that what you did in the bar?

1548
01:38:41.067 --> 01:38:41.900
- You were there?

1549
01:38:43.033 --> 01:38:43.991
- When I tried to lose it?

1550
01:38:46.130 --> 01:38:47.340
- Yes.

1551
01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:49.750
- Funny. I didn't see you.

1552
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:53.003
- That is because I came in
such a questionable shape.

1553
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:59.025
- Anyway. we need to do this little dance

1554
01:38:59.025 --> 01:39:00.155
and then you have to say...

1555
01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.010
Well. I'll show you as we go along.

1556
01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:07.240
- Great. then let's do this
without any further ado!

1557
01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.190
- [Nevinovat] Master.

1558
01:39:08.190 --> 01:39:09.600
- What is it?

1559
01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.433
- The ritual.

1560
01:39:10.433 --> 01:39:12.011
- Ah. forget about that.

1561
01:39:12.011 --> 01:39:14.403
Let's just get on with
it. this is gonna be cool.

1562
01:39:18.715 --> 01:39:19.956
- What about your accent?

1563
01:39:19.956 --> 01:39:22.320
- Now give him a break. I'm
trying to do some business here.

1564
01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.780
Come on now. what do you want?

1565
01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:26.098
- Your villainous accent!

1566
01:39:27.148 --> 01:39:28.770
- My...

1567
01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:31.520
Oh. damn! I forgot.

1568
01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:34.023
Anyway. let's just get this over with.

1569
01:39:41.865 --> 01:39:44.420
(smooth jazz music)

1570
01:39:45.670 --> 01:39:47.190
- What are you doing?

1571
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:49.860
- I'm taking what's mine!

1572
01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:53.175
- But I already sold it to Walker.

1573
01:39:53.175 --> 01:39:55.190
See. with the touch. he's sure to win

1574
01:39:55.190 --> 01:39:59.200
and then you will benefit
greatly. my friend.

1575
01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:01.550
'cause then you can use his
money and influence to...

1576
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:04.530
- No. I need to have it.

1577
01:40:04.530 --> 01:40:06.610
- No. you don't understand.

1578
01:40:06.610 --> 01:40:08.170
As head of a federal state

1579
01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:12.050
Walker would give you everything you need.

1580
01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:15.000
Just imagine: No taxes.

1581
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.940
government grants to develop
the dependency of the people.

1582
01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:20.663
by the people. for the people.

1583
01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:24.840
cultural funding for your cult

1584
01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:28.510
and possibly even access to
weapons of mass destruction.

1585
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:30.205
- No. it has to be me!

1586
01:40:30.205 --> 01:40:31.038
- You?

1587
01:40:32.078 --> 01:40:34.908
- I'm the boss. so it must be me.

1588
01:40:34.908 --> 01:40:36.060
- Why does it have to be...

1589
01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.330
you?
- Me?

1590
01:40:37.330 --> 01:40:39.000
'Cause I need to be followed.

1591
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.920
It says so in the book. so I must have it.

1592
01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.983
It's me. not him. Me! Got it?

1593
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.852
- I...

1594
01:40:45.852 --> 01:40:48.020
- Tell him. who's me?

1595
01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:49.430
- YOU are me!

1596
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:51.363
- See. only I am me!

1597
01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:56.210
- Yeah. well you're absolutely right.

1598
01:40:56.210 --> 01:40:59.720
You are a key element of our brand.

1599
01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.070
Maybe it's time to...?

1600
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:02.710
- Yes?

1601
01:41:02.710 --> 01:41:03.928
- Di...
- Die?

1602
01:41:03.928 --> 01:41:04.949
- ...versify.

1603
01:41:04.949 --> 01:41:09.540
- Diversify? How can I
diversify when there's only me?

1604
01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:11.471
Oh. I know what this is about.

1605
01:41:11.471 --> 01:41:14.570
You want to waggle your way
to the top using Walker.

1606
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:17.690
who probably promised you
some job in his administration

1607
01:41:17.690 --> 01:41:21.943
but before long. you're a
made man and I'm no longer me.

1608
01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:25.070
- This isn't just about you.

1609
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:27.420
There are other people involved!

1610
01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:29.120
What gives YOU the right to...?

1611
01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.700
- I have the right for I am ME!

1612
01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:34.190
- No. you're not. HE is you!

1613
01:41:34.190 --> 01:41:35.153
- Shut up. I am.

1614
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:41.090
I have been me since the beginning of time

1615
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:42.740
when the earth was in spring

1616
01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:45.390
and the first bird sang the first song

1617
01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:49.654
and he who casts doubt on
the revelation shall perish!

1618
01:41:50.611 --> 01:41:53.028
(Ron groans)

1619
01:41:55.451 --> 01:41:56.720
Now let's continue!

1620
01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:59.120
Do we need any blood for the procedure?

1621
01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:01.033
- Please. give it to me!

1622
01:42:02.130 --> 01:42:04.620
- Oh. no. I really can't.

1623
01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.307
For all that it's worth. but
maybe I know someone who can.

1624
01:42:07.307 --> 01:42:09.750
- No! No. no. no. no. no. no!
That's part of the ritual.

1625
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:10.840
You've gotta say it.

1626
01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:15.260
- Oh! Please give it
to...dammit! What's this noise?

1627
01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:16.735
Why am I always disturbed?

1628
01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:19.803
You!

1629
01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:22.600
I know what you want. You can't have it!

1630
01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.892
- I get anything I want. whenever I want.

1631
01:42:24.892 --> 01:42:28.225
(sinister music)

1632
01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.200
- Yes. yes. yes. but not what's mine

1633
01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:33.780
and now hush up with you. I'm busy.

1634
01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.191
- What do you think you're doing?

1635
01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:39.370
- I'm taking what's mine.

1636
01:42:39.370 --> 01:42:42.080
- No you're not! I need to be touched!

1637
01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:46.140
I mean...I need the touch! This curse.

1638
01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:51.140
- You may be touched but I'm
going to touch the whole world.

1639
01:42:51.688 --> 01:42:54.688
(a minor touch sax music)

1640
01:42:59.169 --> 01:43:00.711
(punch thud)

1641
01:43:00.711 --> 01:43:01.679
(Walker groans)

1642
01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:11.173
I won't be controlled by
mere mortals. Off you go!

1643
01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:16.109
(liberation piano theme)

1644
01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:27.523
Please. give it to me!

1645
01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:30.693
Now let's wrap it up.

1646
01:43:30.693 --> 01:43:33.943
I only have this room for another hour.

1647
01:44:10.341 --> 01:44:13.066
(dark music)

1648
01:45:18.328 --> 01:45:20.345
(women hissing)

1649
01:45:25.989 --> 01:45:29.231
(No Nonsense News Theme)

1650
01:45:36.132 --> 01:45:38.700
- A get-together of the
Sisters of Light cult

1651
01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:41.030
had a surprising twist today

1652
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:44.660
when a bunch of female
followers turned on their boss.

1653
01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:47.140
They seemed genuinely appalled.

1654
01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:50.640
even disgusted when
they were touched by him

1655
01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.420
And so cult leader Sviatoslav Rău

1656
01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:56.709
got a little more than he bargained for.

1657
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:59.626
(Rău's redemption song)

1658
01:46:02.029 --> 01:46:06.707
♪ He is the hope and the goal! ♪

1659
01:46:06.707 --> 01:46:11.327
♪ He has the key to my soul! ♪

1660
01:46:11.327 --> 01:46:16.078
♪ He knows the way it should be. ♪

1661
01:46:16.078 --> 01:46:21.029
♪ He sees the truth 'cause He's He! ♪

1662
01:46:21.029 --> 01:46:23.946
(dark fairytale sounds)
