When was you gonna tell me?

60
00:04:29.378 --> 00:04:31.136
I literally just

00:04:32.513 --> 00:04:35.140
Hmm. Well. congratulations.

62
00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:36.108
Are you gonna take it?

63
00:04:37.012 --> 00:04:38.682
I don't know yet. Should I?

64
00:04:40.422 --> 00:04:42.950
Well. I can't decide that
for you.

65
00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:44.083
Only you can.

66
00:04:44.954 --> 00:04:45.920
You right.

67
00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:48.626
You absolutely right.

68
00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:50.056
Let me ask you a question.

69
00:04:50.091 --> 00:04:51.959
What's up?

70
00:04:51.994 --> 00:04:54.434
Why are you staying
in this little apartment

71
00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.700
when you could be staying
in the house your mom left
you?

72
00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:01.034
You still looking
for her killer. aren't you?

73
00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:06.413
No. I'm not.

74
00:05:08.483 --> 00:05:09.383
I don't know.

75
00:05:11.684 --> 00:05:13.277
But when I decide
to move into the house.

76
00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:16.522
I'll make sure
to hit your ass up
to actually help me move.

77
00:05:18.856 --> 00:05:20.592
-- No?

78
00:05:20.627 --> 00:05:23.188
--All right. I'm out of here.

79
00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:25.465
Look. did you get
everything out of my car?

80
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.962
-Yeah. got everything.

81
00:05:27.997 --> 00:05:28.963

82
00:05:28.998 --> 00:05:30.899

83
00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:32.362

- You pissed me off.

89
00:05:49.414 --> 00:05:52.426
No. but I don't understand.
Why do you just
keep showing up over here?

90
00:05:52.461 --> 00:05:53.658
You know why.

91
00:05:53.693 --> 00:05:55.759
- I told you. we are
done! So. just...

92
00:05:59.732 --> 00:06:01.226
Just move.

93
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.279
You all right?

94
00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:25.184

00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:34.732
Yeah. I remember you
from earlier.

98
00:06:36.428 --> 00:06:38.736

you was in the hallway
arguing with?

99
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.673
Ex.

100
00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:43.268
How long you been living here?

101
00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:44.775
Five years.

102
00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:46.579
How about you?

103
00:06:47.043 --> 00:06:48.108
Not long.

104
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:51.683
Couple of weeks. Two. three.

105
00:06:51.718 --> 00:06:53.454
Oh. so you still fresh?

106
00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:55.346
Uh. you can say that.

107
00:06:56.723 --> 00:06:58.085
You're a cop. I see.

108
00:06:59.594 --> 00:07:01.121
Wrong choice of living.
don't you think?

109
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:02.991
Nah. I like it.

110
00:07:03.994 --> 00:07:05.697
Kind of remind me of New York.

111
00:07:05.732 --> 00:07:07.996
Mmm. nah. I wouldn't know.

112
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:09.228
I've never been to New York.

113
00:07:09.802 --> 00:07:10.669
Mmm.

114
00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:14.332
You gotta...
You gotta go one day.

115
00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:15.399
Mmm.

116
00:07:16.138 --> 00:07:17.038
Maybe.

117
00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:21.306
All right.

123
00:07:52.504 --> 00:07:54.504
I've been calling your god

matter.

124
00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:55.879
My phone was dead.

128
00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:01.879
-Are you crazy?
-You think

129
00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:03.788

-Like a whore. You bring
your ass on ahead. come on!

130
00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:06.923

Yo. why don't you

135

Yo. I don't know
what you're talking about.

138
00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:19.430
-What the fuck you gonna

the next woman on the news.

Oi.<i> amigo!</i>

180
00:10:42.047 --> 00:10:43.013
What you say?

181
00:10:45.985 --> 00:10:47.886
Rayven.

182
00:10:47.921 --> 00:10:51.054
If you like her.
I'll make a deal with you.

183
00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:53.793
I'll give her to you.

184
00:10:54.763 --> 00:10:56.092
All you gotta do is...

185
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.029
-just pay me.

186
00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:01.493
Pay you?

187
00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:03.099
Or...

188
00:11:05.004 --> 00:11:07.400
You let me taste your friend.

189
00:11:07.435 --> 00:11:08.742
Sky.

190
00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:13.846
I'll take real
good care of her.

191
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:17.608
What you think. I'm scared
of you. son. 'cause you some
money-making pimp

192
00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:19.379
-that like to hit women?

193
00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:22.283
Yeah. I know about you. man.

194
00:11:22.318 --> 00:11:23.581
-Oh. yeah?
-Yeah. motherfucka.

195
00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:26.221
I became a cop
because of people like you.

196
00:11:26.256 --> 00:11:28.718
If you ever. and I mean ever.

197
00:11:28.753 --> 00:11:31.028
mention anybody name
you may think I know again.

198
00:11:31.063 --> 00:11:34.526
I'll put a bullet so far
up your fucking mouth.
you won't know what hit you.

199
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:37.529
Oh. so that's a threat?

200
00:11:37.564 --> 00:11:39.905
No. Motherfucka.
That's a promise.

201
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.203
And I mean what I say.

202
00:11:41.238 --> 00:11:42.468
I won't think two shits
of it.

203
00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:54.612
Try me.

204
00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:57.989
-Try me.

205
00:12:17.043 --> 00:12:17.976
Rayven!

206
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:19.670
Open the door.

207
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.851
- Robert. can you please
just leave me alone?

208
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:26.710
We've been done.

209
00:12:28.989 --> 00:12:30.857
So you not listening to me?

210
00:12:51.176 --> 00:12:52.307
Hey. Jerome.

211
00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:55.079
What's up. Rayven?

212
00:12:55.576 --> 00:12:56.674
Nothing.

213
00:12:59.382 --> 00:13:01.184
I'm all right. I
couldn't sleep.

214
00:13:02.682 --> 00:13:03.956
You up for a walk?

215
00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:05.782
Let me. um.
change my clothes. all right?

216
00:13:17.202 --> 00:13:18.795
You look nice tonight.

217
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.534
-You got a little date night
or something?

218
00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:22.502
You can say that.

219
00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:25.879
Oh. wait. So.
like. the ex-boo?

220
00:13:27.377 --> 00:13:28.508
Somebody I grew up with.

221
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.446
What's going on?

222
00:13:32.481 --> 00:13:34.085
-What's going through your
mind? -

223
00:13:36.089 --> 00:13:38.023
Well...

224
00:13:38.058 --> 00:13:40.817
I really shouldn't be
telling you this 'cause
I don't know you like that.

225
00:13:41.721 --> 00:13:43.160
but I don't know.

226
00:13:43.195 --> 00:13:44.557
You seem cool.

227
00:13:44.592 --> 00:13:46.658
Kinda feel like
I can trust you.

228
00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:49.661
Trust me? Don't
I feel special.

229
00:13:49.696 --> 00:13:52.598
-You should.
because I'm a special girl.

230
00:13:56.043 --> 00:13:57.471
Anyway...

231
00:14:02.577 --> 00:14:04.445
-Jerome. I'm a stripper.

232
00:14:05.349 --> 00:14:06.953
Come on. stop playin'.

233
00:14:06.988 --> 00:14:08.845
No. I'm serious.

234
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.748
-I've been dancing
for some years now.
-Wanna sit down?

235
00:14:19.231 --> 00:14:21.429
I've been dancing
for some years now.

236
00:14:21.464 --> 00:14:23.970
and I'm trying
to get out of it.

237
00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:26.764
So what's stopping you?

238
00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:28.766
Bills.

239
00:14:30.374 --> 00:14:33.276
And sad
to say. Robert.

240
00:14:35.478 --> 00:14:38.578
Met him when I first started
working at the strip club
a few years ago.

241
00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:42.318
He was a good guy
and he helped me out a lot.

242
00:14:43.948 --> 00:14:46.685
But then he started changing.

243
00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:51.998
I didn't have a place to live
and he let me stay with him.

244
00:14:52.033 --> 00:14:55.100
But he would literally
just take all my money.

245
00:14:56.466 --> 00:14:59.500
He just became really abusive

246
00:14:59.535 --> 00:15:01.469
and was. like. threatening me
all the time.

247
00:15:04.276 --> 00:15:06.804
I was dumb and I didn't really
wanna believe that that's
what he was doing.

248
00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:07.838
but he was.

249
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.449
I just don't know
what to do.

250
00:15:16.453 --> 00:15:17.683
So what you want me to do?

251
00:15:19.522 --> 00:15:21.753
I don't know.
you're a cop. right?

252
00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:23.425
Can't you arrest his ass
or something?

253
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.855
It don't work like that.

254
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:27.495
You say
he a powerful guy. right?

255
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.795
Plus. I'm just a street cop.

256
00:15:32.469 --> 00:15:33.765
Yeah. and?

257
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.538
Okay. that means he gotta
have somebody on payroll.

258
00:15:42.974 --> 00:15:44.347
But I can keep an ear
open for you.

259
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.548
All right?

260
00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:50.881
Can I ask you a question?

261
00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.059
Yeah.

262
00:15:54.425 --> 00:15:56.722
Is... dancing all you do?

263
00:15:59.023 --> 00:16:00.561
What. you trying
to ask me if I'm a ho?

264
00:16:01.564 --> 00:16:02.563
I'm not.

265
00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:09.900
I have slept with a few guys.
here and there. but that's it.

266
00:16:12.674 --> 00:16:13.574
If I'm being honest...

267
00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:16.907
my mother was a prostitute.

268
00:16:19.087 --> 00:16:21.318
And all I know
is she died from it.

269
00:16:25.159 --> 00:16:26.059
I'm sorry to hear that.

270
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.722
Wait. What do you mean.
from all you know?

271
00:16:33.101 --> 00:16:35.497
I grew up in a foster home.

272
00:16:35.532 --> 00:16:37.367
That's why I never really knew
what happened to my mother.

273
00:16:40.603 --> 00:16:42.603
That's the reason
why I became a cop.

274
00:16:45.608 --> 00:16:48.114
To protect women
of the streets like yourself.

275
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.053
But I got you.

276
00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:55.286
You gonna be good. all right?

277
00:16:59.017 --> 00:17:01.226
Come on. let me treat you
to some coffee.

278
00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:03.327
Coffee?

279
00:17:03.362 --> 00:17:05.098
That's that bougie shit.
I'm gonna need a real drink.

280
00:17:05.133 --> 00:17:07.991
What you want. some Henny?
-Yeah.

281
00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:10.070
-Want some Patron?
-For sure.

282
00:17:34.657 --> 00:17:36.228
- Oh. look who it is.

283
00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:37.493
Hey. what's up?

284
00:17:37.528 --> 00:17:39.297
-What's going on. Rayven?
-You okay?

285
00:17:39.332 --> 00:17:41.794
-I'm good. how are you?
-Good.

286
00:17:41.829 --> 00:17:44.566
-How you feeling?
-I feel good.

287
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:46.370
I actually thought
about you earlier.

288
00:17:46.405 --> 00:17:48.273
-Oh. yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

289
00:17:48.308 --> 00:17:52.409
Yeah. I really wanted
to thank you for our long talk
last night.

290
00:17:52.444 --> 00:17:55.643
-I really. really.
really needed that.
-Hmm.

291
00:17:55.678 --> 00:17:57.810
So much so that...

292
00:17:57.845 --> 00:17:59.548
I decided to stop dancing.

293
00:17:59.583 --> 00:18:01.286
-Wait. what?
-Yeah.

294
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:03.585
I'm gonna enroll myself
in school.

295
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.950
That's what's up.
Where'd that come from?

296
00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:08.986
I don't know. I just think
it's time for a change.

297
00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:12.264
So I called my boss and I was
like. "Look. I'm done."

298
00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:15.333
And. so. tonight is actually
my last night dancing.

299
00:18:16.468 --> 00:18:19.733
And I was...

300
00:18:19.768 --> 00:18:21.834
kind of hoping
that you could come.

301
00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:24.771
Well. first of all.
congratulations.

302
00:18:24.806 --> 00:18:26.674
I'm proud of you
taking different steps.

303
00:18:26.709 --> 00:18:27.972
That's a good thing.

304
00:18:28.007 --> 00:18:30.183
Thank you. I mean.
I really owe it all to you.

305
00:18:30.218 --> 00:18:32.009
Nah. you don't owe me. man.

306
00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.848
So I'mma see you tonight?

307
00:18:36.686 --> 00:18:38.950
Oh. man.

308
00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:42.393
I don't wanna make you
any promises. but I can see
what I can do. all right?

309
00:18:44.529 --> 00:18:46.463
All right. I understand.

310
00:18:46.498 --> 00:18:47.761
I know you're a busy man.

311
00:18:47.796 --> 00:18:50.731
-Got a job and all that.

312
00:18:50.766 --> 00:18:54.031
But I do hope to
see you tonight.

313
00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:56.132
-Cool?
-Cool.

314
00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.872
All right. well. I'm gonna
hurry up and get out of here

315
00:18:59.907 --> 00:19:02.039
'cause I got a lot of stuff
to do.

316
00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:03.678
What you got
there. little girl?

317
00:19:03.713 --> 00:19:06.175
I got stuff to do.
it's my last night.

318
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.979
-Mmm-hmm.
-You gonna miss it.

319
00:19:08.014 --> 00:19:09.981
Hopefully not.

320
00:19:10.016 --> 00:19:13.182
But you. my friend.
are gonna be safe
in these streets.

321
00:19:13.217 --> 00:19:15.360
-All right.
I'll see you later on.
-See you later.

322
00:19:15.395 --> 00:19:16.757
-Have a good night.
-You too.

323
00:19:19.696 --> 00:19:20.794
Damn.

324
00:19:31.939 --> 00:19:33.312
All right. later.

325
00:19:34.282 --> 00:19:37.778
-- Hey!
-Hey. girl!

326
00:19:37.813 --> 00:19:40.649
-Miss This-my-last-night-here.
-I know!

327
00:19:40.684 --> 00:19:42.519
Mmm-hmm.

328
00:19:42.554 --> 00:19:45.291
-I'm gonna miss you all. girl.
-Miss you.

329
00:19:45.326 --> 00:19:47.920
-I'mma miss you all. too.
-We're gonna miss the
fuck out of you. girl.

330
00:19:47.955 --> 00:19:49.757
-I'm just right down
the street. seriously.
-All right.

331
00:19:49.792 --> 00:19:52.859
-Are we acting all bougie
queen? -I won't!

332
00:19:52.894 --> 00:19:54.960
-All right.
I'mma call you all later.
-All right. girl.

333
00:19:54.995 --> 00:19:56.302
- Hey. yo. Rayven!

334
00:19:57.228 --> 00:19:59.371
Oh. girl!

335
00:19:59.406 --> 00:20:02.275
-You better go get your money!
-No. it is not like that.

336
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.903
He is just a friend.

337
00:20:03.938 --> 00:20:05.971
-- Yeah.
that's what we all say.

338
00:20:14.322 --> 00:20:15.948
- Hey.
- What's up?

339
00:20:15.983 --> 00:20:17.488
What are you doing here?

340
00:20:17.523 --> 00:20:19.017
You know.
I'll miss your grand finale.

341
00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:21.591
Least I could do was come
to give you a ride. right?

342
00:20:21.626 --> 00:20:23.923
-Aw. thank you.
-How was your night?

343
00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:26.222
It was good. It
was really good.

344
00:20:26.257 --> 00:20:27.960
Okay. Got a lot of money?

345
00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:30.435
-Money in the bag.

346
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:31.865
-I got you something.
-Really?

347
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.932
-Yeah. hold on.
-Okay.

348
00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:41.237
Aw. thank you.

349
00:20:42.482 --> 00:20:44.779
So sweet of you.

350
00:20:44.814 --> 00:20:46.715
Yeah. I don't know.

351
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.750
It's the thought
that counts. right?

352
00:20:48.785 --> 00:20:49.916
It's a little sign.

353
00:20:57.024 --> 00:20:58.254
Thank you.

354
00:20:59.598 --> 00:21:00.861
Very sweet.

355
00:21:02.293 --> 00:21:03.369
I really appreciate that.

356
00:21:03.998 --> 00:21:05.503
No doubt. Shall we?

357
00:21:06.132 --> 00:21:07.604
Sure.

358
00:21:07.639 --> 00:21:08.671
Wait.

359
00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:12.543
-I wanna take you somewhere.
-Take me where?

360
00:21:13.304 --> 00:21:14.545
It's a surprise.

361
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.008
-A surprise?
-Mmm-hmm.

362
00:21:17.176 --> 00:21:19.044
-Are you down?
-I'm down.

363
00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:20.947
-All right.
-Come one.

364
00:21:20.982 --> 00:21:22.652
No. wait. actually.
let me drive.

365
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.687
You ain't even got no license.

366
00:21:24.722 --> 00:21:26.953
I don't need a license.
You a cop. remember?

367
00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:31.958
-You better not scratch my
car. all right?
-I got you.

368
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.536
You better not.
I'm telling you.

369
00:21:38.571 --> 00:21:39.834
That bag gonna be mine.

370
00:21:49.648 --> 00:21:50.845
- You like?

371
00:21:51.815 --> 00:21:53.012
- It's beautiful.

372
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.179
Yeah.

373
00:21:56.556 --> 00:21:59.359
I come here whenever I wanna
just escape the world.

374
00:22:05.026 --> 00:22:06.432
You're really spiritual. huh?

375
00:22:07.567 --> 00:22:08.467
Yeah. a little.

376
00:22:10.702 --> 00:22:12.999
I get it from my mother.

377
00:22:13.034 --> 00:22:15.573
She used to read
these spiritual books
to me before bed.

378
00:22:17.005 --> 00:22:19.137
Taught me so much
about the moon.

379
00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:22.778
So tell me about this moon.

380
00:22:25.343 --> 00:22:26.848
Well...

381
00:22:26.883 --> 00:22:30.753
That's a full moon.
which represents
our inner world.

382
00:22:32.053 --> 00:22:33.393
Our hidden emotions.

383
00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:35.626
Our desires.

384
00:22:36.354 --> 00:22:38.596
Our shadow self.

385
00:22:38.631 --> 00:22:40.895
Our fears. our worries.
and our dreams.

386
00:22:45.396 --> 00:22:48.034
It offers us the ability
to escape.

387
00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:50.366
and learn from the past.

388
00:22:51.776 --> 00:22:54.711
and creatively unlock
and express our essence.

389
00:22:57.177 --> 00:22:58.682
Wow.

390
00:22:58.717 --> 00:23:00.948
I didn't know the moon
had so much of a purpose.

391
00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:03.313
It gets deeper.

392
00:23:06.626 --> 00:23:08.428
I'm glad you're willing
to learn it. friend.

393
00:23:09.288 --> 00:23:10.254
You mentioned your mother.

394
00:23:11.598 --> 00:23:12.960
Where is she?

395
00:23:12.995 --> 00:23:14.731
She died when I was six.

396
00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.800
My aunt raised me.

397
00:23:21.575 --> 00:23:23.267
That sounds similar
to my story.

398
00:23:25.073 --> 00:23:27.139
-What about your father?
-Mmm.

399
00:23:29.308 --> 00:23:31.484
He's around. you know?

400
00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:34.410
I talk to him every now and
then whenever he wants to be
loving.

401
00:23:35.083 --> 00:23:36.918
But...

402
00:23:36.953 --> 00:23:39.954
He's not the typical
type of father that you like
to show off. you know?

403
00:23:41.485 --> 00:23:44.794
-Yeah.
-But we don't get to pick
our parents.

404
00:23:48.998 --> 00:23:50.162
Word.

405
00:23:50.197 --> 00:23:51.328
Why do you say that?

406
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.166
Just the stuff he doing.

407
00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:56.641
I don't agree with it.

408
00:23:59.811 --> 00:24:02.713
That's probably why
I'm fucked up now
and have daddy issues.

409
00:24:09.315 --> 00:24:10.721
Your hands are so filthy.

410
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.592
You should take
better care of them.

411
00:24:17.664 --> 00:24:18.630
I'll try.

412
00:24:21.063 --> 00:24:22.194
You ready to go?

413
00:24:23.032 --> 00:24:24.262
I'm getting a little chilly.

414
00:24:30.171 --> 00:24:31.302
Not yet.

415
00:24:32.239 --> 00:24:33.876
I'm kind of
enjoying the moment.

416
00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.242
Get up.

417
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.390
Thank you.

418
00:25:12.719 --> 00:25:14.312
-What?

419
00:25:15.953 --> 00:25:17.722
Nothing.

420
00:25:17.757 --> 00:25:19.625
Tonight definitely
turned out perfect.

421
00:25:21.959 --> 00:25:24.157
Yes. I do agree.

422
00:25:24.192 --> 00:25:26.698
Oh. and here's
your jacket back.

423
00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:28.392
Thank you.

424
00:25:29.395 --> 00:25:31.637
Thank you for
being a gentleman.

425
00:25:37.238 --> 00:25:38.468
What? What's wrong?

426
00:25:40.043 --> 00:25:42.681
-Nothing.
-What. you got a girl
or something?

427
00:25:43.409 --> 00:25:44.716
No. it's not that.

428
00:25:46.148 --> 00:25:47.477
It's just. I don't wanna
move too fast.

429
00:25:49.316 --> 00:25:50.755
I got a habit
of messing things up.

430
00:25:53.353 --> 00:25:56.156
Well. look. things can only
be messed up if the feelings
aren't mutual.

431
00:25:57.929 --> 00:25:58.829
Don't overthink it.

432
00:26:04.298 --> 00:26:06.562
See you tomorrow. okay?

433
00:26:06.597 --> 00:26:08.399
-Well. good night.
-Good night. Jerome.

434
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:32.258
Did you have a good night?

435
00:26:33.558 --> 00:26:34.667
What are you doing in here?

436
00:26:35.868 --> 00:26:38.000
I can't see my lady?

437
00:26:38.035 --> 00:26:40.068
I'm not your lady.

438
00:26:41.742 --> 00:26:43.203
Who said you're not?

439
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.009
Can you just leave. please?

440
00:26:48.848 --> 00:26:50.947
Oh. I'll leave...

441
00:26:50.982 --> 00:26:53.477
after you give me the money
you owe me.

442
00:26:53.512 --> 00:26:54.720
What money?

443
00:26:57.417 --> 00:26:59.758
My fucking money. bitch!

444
00:27:00.992 --> 00:27:02.519
I don't owe you any money.

445
00:27:05.227 --> 00:27:07.832
You think you don't owe me?

446
00:27:07.867 --> 00:27:11.594
You think you can just quit
whenever you want?

447
00:27:12.971 --> 00:27:14.806
I built you.

448
00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:18.777
your life. your career.

449
00:27:18.812 --> 00:27:20.911
Everything about you...

450
00:27:22.277 --> 00:27:24.046
I built.

451
00:27:24.081 --> 00:27:26.411
I built my own damn life.

452
00:27:26.446 --> 00:27:28.985
And I don't owe you.

453
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.218
And I'm not
afraid of you either.

454
00:27:31.253 --> 00:27:33.253
So if you wanna beat my ass.
so be it.

455
00:27:34.454 --> 00:27:36.289
But I will no longer
run from you.

456
00:27:46.499 --> 00:27:47.938
Fine.

457
00:27:48.501 --> 00:27:49.709
Have it your way.

458
00:27:51.207 --> 00:27:52.569
But I'll be back.

459
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.848
And I want my money. Rayven.

460
00:27:58.115 --> 00:28:01.611
I want my fucking money!

461
00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:41.651
Lonely night?

462
00:28:54.633 --> 00:28:55.907
Look. man.

463
00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:59.207
I don't know who you think
you are...

464
00:29:03.048 --> 00:29:04.443
I'm gonna tell you one time

465
00:29:06.183 --> 00:29:07.347
and one time only.

466
00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.152
stay away from Rayven.

467
00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.828
Stay away from Rayven. man.

468
00:29:18.822 --> 00:29:21.526
I don't know
what you're talking about.

469
00:29:21.561 --> 00:29:23.231
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

470
00:29:25.873 --> 00:29:28.104
You're making a big mistake.

471
00:29:33.012 --> 00:29:34.539
No.

472
00:29:39.414 --> 00:29:41.546
Don't bring your ass back
over here again. man.

473
00:29:44.386 --> 00:29:45.682
It's my last time telling you.

474
00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:50.423
Or you're gonna have
a bigger problem to handle.

475
00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:07.335
Hey. get off of me!
Get off of me!

476
00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:01.257
-Who is it?

477
00:32:01.292 --> 00:32:02.225
Who is it?

478
00:32:06.726 --> 00:32:08.429
Jerome!

479
00:32:09.201 --> 00:32:10.266
You gotta help me.

480
00:32:10.301 --> 00:32:11.795
All right. what's up?
You all right?

481
00:32:13.205 --> 00:32:14.501
They're trying to kill me.

482
00:32:14.536 --> 00:32:15.733
Who is trying to kill you?

483
00:32:17.638 --> 00:32:20.980
Two guys. They just tried
to put me in a car.

484
00:32:26.251 --> 00:32:27.316
You all right?

485
00:32:28.088 --> 00:32:29.450
You all right?

486
00:32:30.783 --> 00:32:32.486
Can you help me. please?

487
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.061
What are you talking about?
I got you.

488
00:32:36.096 --> 00:32:37.194
Where they at?

489
00:32:38.362 --> 00:32:40.362
They're in the front.
I left them.

490
00:32:40.397 --> 00:32:43.398
I locked them out.
but I don't...

491
00:32:43.433 --> 00:32:44.828
All right.
Just relax. all right?

492
00:32:46.733 --> 00:32:48.436
I got you.

493
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:49.668
I'll be right back.

494
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.244
-Just lock the door. okay?

495
00:32:56.083 --> 00:32:57.709
-Lock the door.
-Okay.

496
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:41.951
- Rayven. open the door.
it's me.

497
00:33:44.428 --> 00:33:45.625
Rayven.

498
00:33:47.134 --> 00:33:48.529
Come on.
we gotta get outta here.

499
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.060
Where are we going?

500
00:33:52.095 --> 00:33:52.995
Away.

501
00:33:55.835 --> 00:33:56.834
Away where?

502
00:33:58.607 --> 00:34:00.409
Look. you said you want
to be safe. right?

503
00:34:00.444 --> 00:34:03.005
I do. But I'd still like
to know where we're going.

504
00:34:03.843 --> 00:34:05.150
Look.

505
00:34:05.185 --> 00:34:07.251
You asked for my help.
so I'm helping you.

506
00:34:07.286 --> 00:34:09.847
Let's go upstairs
and get your stuff and get
away for a couple of days.

507
00:34:14.227 --> 00:34:15.160
Is that cool?

508
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.098
-Yeah.
-All right.

509
00:34:23.126 --> 00:34:24.367
You ever shot a gun before?

510
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.372
I've been to the gun range
when I was younger.
but that's it.

511
00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:37.039
- Good.

512
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:40.614
You're gonna need
all the experience.

513
00:34:44.653 --> 00:34:45.982
Let's go.

514
00:34:46.017 --> 00:34:47.390
Let's get outta here.

515
00:35:10.712 --> 00:35:11.612
Thank you.

516
00:35:27.124 --> 00:35:28.266
Whose house is this?

517
00:35:29.401 --> 00:35:30.301
It's mine.

518
00:35:31.062 --> 00:35:31.896
Yours?

519
00:35:32.767 --> 00:35:33.931
Yes. it's mine.

520
00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:37.407
My mother left it to me.

521
00:35:37.442 --> 00:35:39.772
Can you put your bags down
and don't touch nothing?

522
00:35:41.204 --> 00:35:43.248
You don't have to be
so nasty about it.

523
00:35:46.649 --> 00:35:48.077
Please. Is that better?

524
00:35:50.587 --> 00:35:53.082
Look. if you're gonna be
an ass about it.
I can just leave.

525
00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:54.787
Because I'm really not
feeling your attitude.

526
00:35:56.461 --> 00:35:58.021
I'm sorry. all right?

527
00:35:58.056 --> 00:36:00.122
Just tired and...

528
00:36:01.697 --> 00:36:02.927
I just wanna lay down.

529
00:36:03.996 --> 00:36:06.128
So can you please

530
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.240
have a seat?

531
00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:14.642
I'm gonna go put my stuff
down. all right?

532
00:36:29.054 --> 00:36:30.053
Is this your mother?

533
00:36:41.473 --> 00:36:43.803
Yes.
this is my mother.

534
00:36:45.906 --> 00:36:47.675
And I thought I asked you
not to touch nothing.

535
00:36:52.451 --> 00:36:53.681
I actually took that picture.

536
00:36:55.454 --> 00:36:57.014
That was my first
baseball game.

537
00:36:58.149 --> 00:37:00.556
My mom was crazy.

538
00:37:00.591 --> 00:37:04.252
She used to be
the only black person
in the stand screaming my
name.

539
00:37:04.287 --> 00:37:06.925
"Go. Jerome! Go. Jerome!"

540
00:37:12.636 --> 00:37:13.800
It's crazy. man.

541
00:37:16.101 --> 00:37:17.100
You all right?

542
00:37:17.806 --> 00:37:20.070
Yeah.

543
00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:23.348
My family actually
doesn't live too far from
here.

544
00:37:23.383 --> 00:37:26.615
So I was kind of hoping
that maybe we could stop by.
if you don't mind.

545
00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:27.847
Yeah. let's do that.

546
00:37:27.882 --> 00:37:29.651
Wanna get something
to eat first?

547
00:37:29.686 --> 00:37:32.247
-Mmm-hmm.
-All right.

548
00:37:32.282 --> 00:37:34.392
-Um. where's your restroom?
-Right there.

549
00:37:34.427 --> 00:37:36.053
All right.

550
00:38:01.982 --> 00:38:04.147
-- Hey. aunty!
-Hey. Rayven.

551
00:38:04.182 --> 00:38:06.050
What you doing here?

552
00:38:06.085 --> 00:38:08.459
Oh... We were
just in the area.

553
00:38:08.494 --> 00:38:10.285
-Okay.
-Come to just stop by.
This is my friend. Jerome.

554
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.396
-Hi. Jerome.
-How you doing?

555
00:38:11.431 --> 00:38:13.497
Come on in. Y'all come on in.

556
00:38:23.938 --> 00:38:27.412
So are you guys hungry?
I just cooked.

557
00:38:27.447 --> 00:38:29.513
No. we just ate. Thank you.

558
00:38:30.747 --> 00:38:32.384
So what brought you by?

559
00:38:32.419 --> 00:38:33.979
Well. we were
just in the area.

560
00:38:34.014 --> 00:38:35.750
and I wanted to see
my favorite aunty.

561
00:38:35.785 --> 00:38:39.589
Aw. that's so sweet.
I'm glad you did.

562
00:38:39.624 --> 00:38:41.151
Where are you from. Jerome?

563
00:38:41.186 --> 00:38:43.054
I'm from the area.

564
00:38:43.089 --> 00:38:46.398
I haven't been around
in a while.

565
00:38:46.433 --> 00:38:48.367
I was in a foster home
when I was younger.

566
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.065
Okay. Well. welcome home.

567
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.233
You're welcome to come by here
any time you want.

568
00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:58.300
I appreciate it.

569
00:38:59.138 --> 00:39:01.908
-Okay?
-Thank you.

570
00:39:01.943 --> 00:39:03.679
Now you know
your daddy's in town. right?

571
00:39:03.714 --> 00:39:07.210
Mmm-mmm. I had no clue.
I haven't talked to him.

572
00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:09.421
Well. maybe it's
just your luck.

573
00:39:11.117 --> 00:39:13.623
-Ronald.
-- What?

574
00:39:13.658 --> 00:39:15.526
- Come on in here.

575
00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:17.429
There's someone
that wants to say hi to you.

576
00:39:28.068 --> 00:39:30.409
-- Oh. man.

577
00:39:32.105 --> 00:39:35.007
-Hey. Daddy.
-Baby. Mmm!

578
00:39:39.486 --> 00:39:40.419
Look at you.

579
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.455
Wow.

580
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.788
-And who may this might be?
-This her friend Jerome.

581
00:39:46.823 --> 00:39:49.593
-- Jerome.
How are doing. Jerome?
-Fine. thanks.

582
00:39:49.628 --> 00:39:52.761
Jerome here is from
the South Side. too.

583
00:39:52.796 --> 00:39:54.125
What part of the South Side?

584
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.094
The 70s.

585
00:39:56.129 --> 00:39:57.634
The 70s?

586
00:39:58.703 --> 00:40:00.032
Well. it's nice meeting you.

587
00:40:01.266 --> 00:40:03.475
Well. you know what's funny.

588
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:06.478
is that Ronald used to be
in the 70s. too.

589
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.943
Maybe he knew your mama.

590
00:40:09.978 --> 00:40:12.616
Oh. girl. You think
I know everybody.

591
00:40:12.651 --> 00:40:14.442
That's it. You do.

592
00:40:14.477 --> 00:40:17.621
But I'll let you catch up
with your aunty.

593
00:40:17.656 --> 00:40:19.414
Where are you going?

594
00:40:19.449 --> 00:40:22.692
I got some running around
to do before I get
out of town tomorrow.

595
00:40:22.727 --> 00:40:24.991
Back out of town?
But you just got here.

596
00:40:25.026 --> 00:40:26.564
Yeah. I know.

597
00:40:26.599 --> 00:40:28.159
But I promise.

598
00:40:28.194 --> 00:40:31.294
I'll make sure I get around
to see you tomorrow.

599
00:40:31.329 --> 00:40:32.669
and we can catch up.

600
00:40:34.134 --> 00:40:36.233
You guys staying
on the 70s. right?

601
00:40:36.268 --> 00:40:38.334
Yeah. 1152.

602
00:40:39.139 --> 00:40:40.710
1152.

603
00:40:40.745 --> 00:40:42.514
Okay. I'll be around
there tomorrow.

604
00:40:45.178 --> 00:40:47.244
Girl. you're looking good.

605
00:40:47.279 --> 00:40:49.521
-You're looking
just like your mama.

606
00:40:49.556 --> 00:40:52.480
Damn! I love you.

607
00:40:52.515 --> 00:40:53.525
I love you. baby.

608
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.922
I love you too. Daddy.

609
00:40:57.993 --> 00:41:00.059
-Okay.
-All right. see you tomorrow.

610
00:41:00.094 --> 00:41:01.093
All right.

611
00:41:05.902 --> 00:41:07.033
Where's he's going?

612
00:41:07.574 --> 00:41:10.366
I have no idea.

613
00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:13.336
-He's been running around
since he got here.

614
00:41:14.878 --> 00:41:15.844
All over the place.

615
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.693
Mmm. You got it
smelling good in here.

616
00:41:29.728 --> 00:41:30.991
What you cooking?

617
00:41:31.026 --> 00:41:33.224
A little something something.
You hungry?

618
00:41:33.259 --> 00:41:34.192
Yes.

619
00:41:35.932 --> 00:41:37.096
Thank you.

620
00:41:40.739 --> 00:41:41.738
You all right?

621
00:41:43.269 --> 00:41:44.906
You seem a little off
since yesterday.

622
00:41:45.645 --> 00:41:46.578
I'm fine.

623
00:41:57.415 --> 00:41:58.480
Your energy is down.

624
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.056
What is this.
your little spiritual
shit?

625
00:42:03.091 --> 00:42:04.156
What's that mean?

626
00:42:08.096 --> 00:42:10.602
-Nothing.
-No. say what's on your mind.

627
00:42:11.968 --> 00:42:14.199
Stop running from everything.

628
00:42:14.234 --> 00:42:17.609
-What are you talking about?
I ain't running from nothing.
-You are!

629
00:42:17.644 --> 00:42:20.711
Every time I try to talk to
you. it's like you close off.

630
00:42:20.746 --> 00:42:22.009
What do you want me to say?

631
00:42:22.044 --> 00:42:23.648
-The truth.
-The truth about what?

632
00:42:23.683 --> 00:42:25.782
-What's bothering you?
-Nothing is bothering me.

633
00:42:25.817 --> 00:42:28.312
Can I have a moment to myself
without you trying to
get in my head

634
00:42:28.347 --> 00:42:30.116
with this spiritual
bullshit?

635
00:42:30.151 --> 00:42:31.590
Get in your head?

636
00:42:32.384 --> 00:42:33.691
Spiritual bullshit?

637
00:42:43.362 --> 00:42:46.968
Every time I try to talk to
you. it's like you...

638
00:42:47.003 --> 00:42:47.903
zone out.

639
00:42:48.873 --> 00:42:50.532
Please.

640
00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:54.470
-It's like you're purposely
trying not to open up to me.

641
00:42:58.476 --> 00:42:59.574
Look.

642
00:43:01.644 --> 00:43:04.282
You've gotta learn to face
whatever it is
you're dealing with.

643
00:43:07.254 --> 00:43:08.187
Look at me.

644
00:43:09.388 --> 00:43:10.552
It's okay.

645
00:43:12.127 --> 00:43:13.632
You need love around you.

646
00:43:22.368 --> 00:43:23.400
You're right.

647
00:43:24.909 --> 00:43:27.206
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

669
00:45:06.373 --> 00:45:08.076
It's my dad.

670
00:45:08.111 --> 00:45:10.177
-Oh. shit.

671
00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:13.675
How do I look?

672
00:45:15.151 --> 00:45:16.579
Like you just getting
out of a fight.

673
00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:22.420
-All right. I'm just gonna...
All good? It's good?
-Yeah.

674
00:45:25.865 --> 00:45:27.062
Coming!

675
00:45:28.032 --> 00:45:29.031
All right.

676
00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:39.305
-Hey. Daddy.
-Hey. baby girl.
How are you doing?

677
00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.340
-Good. how are you?
-I'm good. I'm good.

678
00:45:41.375 --> 00:45:42.638
So you can go ahead
and have a seat.

679
00:45:42.673 --> 00:45:43.914
I gotta go do something
real quick.

680
00:45:43.949 --> 00:45:44.948
I'm gonna get Jerome.

681
00:45:44.983 --> 00:45:45.916
Oh. okay.

682
00:45:48.855 --> 00:45:50.085
Jerome. my daddy's here.

683
00:46:00.196 --> 00:46:01.690
How you doing. Jerome?

684
00:46:04.134 --> 00:46:05.166
I'm all right. man.

685
00:46:07.269 --> 00:46:09.874
Well. how did you
and my daughter meet?

686
00:46:12.604 --> 00:46:14.241
We bumped into
each other downtown.

687
00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:17.706
Do you like her?

688
00:46:19.182 --> 00:46:20.577
We're just friends. man.

689
00:46:23.483 --> 00:46:24.647
And what kind of work you do?

690
00:46:28.455 --> 00:46:29.388
I'm a cop.

691
00:46:32.195 --> 00:46:33.260
You like being a cop?

692
00:46:36.694 --> 00:46:38.595
When I first started. man.
let me tell you.

693
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:41.103
when I started being a cop.
I was searching for something.

694
00:46:45.208 --> 00:46:47.043
That's always the case
when you...

695
00:46:47.078 --> 00:46:48.473
when you're searching
for something.

696
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:55.953
Well. tell my baby girl
I love her.

697
00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.352
I'm gonna hit the road.

698
00:46:59.387 --> 00:47:01.255
-Sit down now.
-Excuse me.

699
00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:03.092
I said sit your ass down.

700
00:47:08.099 --> 00:47:09.593
You think I don't know
who you are?

701
00:47:12.499 --> 00:47:14.235
You're the man
who killed my mother. man.

702
00:47:15.975 --> 00:47:19.306
And you got the nerve
to walk up in my house

703
00:47:19.341 --> 00:47:21.077

She called me and asked me
to come over to help her

720
00:48:05.057 --> 00:48:06.716
'cause she was ready
to kill herself.

When we was younger.

794
00:51:42.604 --> 00:51:46.133

you I've been through?

808

812
00:53:59.873 --> 00:54:02.038
-You're lying.
-I'm not lying.

874
00:59:00.811 --> 00:59:02.371
You'll never be hearing
from me again.

875
00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:34.238
Robert. please move.

876
01:00:05.403 --> 01:00:06.842
- What did I say to you?

877
01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:09.240
Now I've been real nice.

878
01:00:10.243 --> 01:00:12.012
And I let you
have a little fun.

879
01:00:12.883 --> 01:00:15.345
But playtime is over.

You know where the fuck
you're at?

905
01:02:23.541 --> 01:02:25.409
I ain't worried about that.

906
01:02:25.444 --> 01:02:26.707
Where she at. man?

907
01:02:28.414 --> 01:02:29.776
I ain't telling

01:02:32.022 --> 01:02:33.417
You got a hour
to bring her to me.

910
01:02:34.387 --> 01:02:35.419
Or your ass is mine. man.

911
01:02:35.454 --> 01:02:38.026
Oh. fucking scary.

912
01:02:39.326 --> 01:02:41.260
-One hour.
-Fuck you!

913
01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.395
That's what your mama said.

914
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:48.102
Fuck you too!
Bunch of bacon wraps.

915
01:02:48.137 --> 01:02:49.807
Fuck all you

I think that's the house
right there.

917
01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.320
That's his car.

918
01:03:09.191 --> 01:03:10.289
Look.

Look. I'm good. all right?
You've helped me enough.

921

I don't need your help.

922
01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:20.497
You crazy if you think
I'm leaving you.

923
01:03:21.467 --> 01:03:23.137
I already got you into this.

924
01:03:24.701 --> 01:03:27.174
But I'm not trying to get you
involved into this shit.
man.

925
01:03:27.209 --> 01:03:28.505
I'm already involved.

926
01:03:30.509 --> 01:03:31.640
You have 15 minutes.

927
01:03:40.816 --> 01:03:42.354
I got this. all right?

928
01:03:43.885 --> 01:03:44.994
-Go home.

<i> Papi.</i>

930
01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:28.757
I know...

931
01:05:30.992 --> 01:05:33.003
I know I haven't
always been there for you.

932
01:05:37.141 --> 01:05:38.008
But I promise...

933
01:05:39.803 --> 01:05:41.110
I promise you.

934
01:05:42.971 --> 01:05:44.476
I'm gonna make
everything different.

935

You're gonna go to a good...

936
01:05:48.812 --> 01:05:50.482
You're gonna go
to a good school.

937
01:05:52.717 --> 01:05:53.584
Mmm.

938
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:56.620
I don't want you to have
to end up like your daddy.

939
01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:03.792
Love you.

940
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:23.647
What took you so long?

941
01:06:24.782 --> 01:06:26.980
This bitch has been
screaming all day.

942
01:06:27.015 --> 01:06:30.225
I want her
out of my house. Roberto.

943
01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:35.494
<i>Mira. calmate.</i> Okay?

944
01:06:35.529 --> 01:06:36.660
Don't tell me to calm down.

945
01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:40.466
What did I say?

946
01:06:41.337 --> 01:06:42.303
Drop the gun.

947
01:06:42.338 --> 01:06:43.304
- Oh. my God.
What the hell?

948
01:06:43.339 --> 01:06:45.999
Fuck! Fuck you
doing in my house?

949
01:06:46.034 --> 01:06:47.407
Drop the gun. man.

950
01:06:47.442 --> 01:06:49.475
-Fuck you!
-Where's she at?

951
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:51.114
I'm about to leave her
in a body bag

952
01:06:51.149 --> 01:06:53.842
and put it right in front
of your door real soon.

953
01:06:53.877 --> 01:06:56.152
I'm gonna give you
to the count of three.

954
01:06:56.748 --> 01:07:00.013
One... Two...

955
01:07:00.048 --> 01:07:01.784
Three. motherfucker.

956
01:07:19.804 --> 01:07:21.903
You fucked up. homes.

957
01:07:21.938 --> 01:07:24.004
Shouldn't came up
in my house like this.

958
01:07:34.423 --> 01:07:35.422
It's okay.<i> mijo.</i>

959
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.162
It's okay.<i> papi.</i> Don't worry.

960
01:07:39.593 --> 01:07:40.526
It's okay.

961
01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:50.965
It's Jerome. huh?

962
01:08:05.619 --> 01:08:07.289
Oh. I've got something
for your ass.

963
01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:12.987
Come out and play.

964
01:08:14.298 --> 01:08:16.331
Come out and play
a little. hmm?

965
01:08:22.339 --> 01:08:24.339
You know what I'm gonna do?

966
01:08:24.374 --> 01:08:26.638
I'm gonna bury both of you
motherfuckers together.

967
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:30.444
That way you can
have your little fairytale.

968
01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:31.973
"And lived happily
ever after."

969
01:08:43.294 --> 01:08:44.326
- Uh...

970
01:08:45.989 --> 01:08:48.561
I see you.

971
01:08:48.596 --> 01:08:50.563
-Oh. fuck!

972
01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.004
You're all right over there?

973
01:09:06.284 --> 01:09:07.283
- fuck you!

974
01:09:09.353 --> 01:09:10.187
You hurt?

975
01:09:12.114 --> 01:09:12.948
Huh?

976
01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.588
- fuck you!

977
01:09:15.623 --> 01:09:17.557
Fuck me.

978
01:09:19.858 --> 01:09:23.299
- Stupid ass.
I'll piss on your fucking
grave.

979
01:09:23.334 --> 01:09:25.763
Is this how you want
your son to grow up. Robert?

980
01:09:25.798 --> 01:09:27.435
So that's what you want to do?

981
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:29.162
You want to go
after my family?

982
01:09:29.197 --> 01:09:31.197
-Nah.
-Fucking coward.

983
01:09:31.232 --> 01:09:32.803
I don't wanna
go after your family.

984
01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:36.312
I wanna go after you.

985
01:09:43.321 --> 01:09:45.288
I'd say where she was at
if I were you.

986
01:09:49.052 --> 01:09:50.051
Where is she?

987
01:09:59.095 --> 01:10:00.237
She's in hell.

988
01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:07.277
Go ahead! Do it!

989
01:10:15.716 --> 01:10:17.254
So do something good
for your life.

990
01:10:19.423 --> 01:10:21.115
Fuck you!

991
01:10:24.021 --> 01:10:25.020
Fuck you.

992
01:10:27.222 --> 01:10:29.761
Jerome! Don't shoot.

993
01:10:29.796 --> 01:10:32.434
Roberto! Roberto!

994
01:10:32.469 --> 01:10:35.899
Oh. my God. Baby. baby. baby.
What did he do to you?

995
01:10:35.934 --> 01:10:38.341
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

996
01:10:38.376 --> 01:10:39.375
Oh. my God!

997
01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:41.410
You fucking murderer!

998
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:06.996
Let's get out of here.

999
01:11:24.818 --> 01:11:28.050
Yeah. No. it's all good.

1000
01:11:28.591 --> 01:11:29.524
It really is.

1001
01:11:30.857 --> 01:11:34.056
No. Uh...
They're glad to see that.

1002
01:11:34.091 --> 01:11:36.223
Yes. Yeah.

1003
01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:38.159
Oh. My daughter is coming.

1004
01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:39.567
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

1005
01:11:39.602 --> 01:11:40.535
All right.

1006
01:11:43.738 --> 01:11:45.903
-Hey.
-Hey. How you doing?

1007
01:11:45.938 --> 01:11:47.267
I'm glad you were
able to make it.

1008
01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:54.043
-Hot chocolate.
-Thank you.

1009
01:11:54.078 --> 01:11:56.551
-You remember?
-Daddy always remember.

1010
01:12:06.123 --> 01:12:07.023
What?

1011
01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:09.663
One thing I can say for sure.

1012
01:12:10.765 --> 01:12:12.325
You are my daughter.

1013
01:12:14.703 --> 01:12:17.440
Is that your way of telling me
you had doubts before?

1014
01:12:17.475 --> 01:12:20.476
No. It's my way
of saying I'm sorry.

1015
01:12:20.511 --> 01:12:24.337
All these years I've been
taking you for granted.

1016
01:12:24.372 --> 01:12:27.450
Putting my responsibilities
up on someone else.

1017
01:12:28.178 --> 01:12:29.177
For that...

1018
01:12:30.114 --> 01:12:31.014
I'm sorry.

1019
01:12:34.151 --> 01:12:35.018
Why though?

1020
01:12:36.659 --> 01:12:38.824
Why would you just leave me

1021
01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:40.320
as if you didn't care.

1022
01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:44.665
knowing that I had nobody
to run to after mom died?

1023
01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.326
I don't have all the answers.

1024
01:12:46.361 --> 01:12:49.835
but what I can say is.
I was running too.

1025
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:53.971
Trying to figure out who I am.
where I want to be at.

1026
01:12:55.238 --> 01:12:57.007
Sometimes as a parent.

1027
01:12:58.175 --> 01:13:00.307
you don't make
all the right decisions.

1028
01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:04.311
That's just an excuse. Daddy.

1029
01:13:05.721 --> 01:13:08.018
Well. that's my truth.

1030
01:13:08.053 --> 01:13:09.382
Well. it's not good enough.

1031
01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:19.898
Daddy. do you know...

1032
01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:23.671
what I had to do for money?

1033
01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.407
I had to dance

1034
01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.553
and sleep with men...

1035
01:13:41.185 --> 01:13:43.053
thinking that they would
give me the kind of love

1036
01:13:43.088 --> 01:13:44.560
that I should have
gotten from you.

1037
01:13:47.532 --> 01:13:50.731
Well. you did what
you had to do. right?

1038
01:13:51.833 --> 01:13:53.602
What?

1039
01:13:53.637 --> 01:13:55.802
What kind of father says that
to their daughter?

1040
01:13:55.837 --> 01:13:58.838
The kind of father
that is still healing. Rayven.

1041
01:13:58.873 --> 01:14:00.070
I'm not perfect.

1042
01:14:00.105 --> 01:14:02.974
I've done some messed-up
things in my life.

1043
01:14:03.009 --> 01:14:05.713
But I didn't sit around
and pout about it.

1044
01:14:05.748 --> 01:14:07.407
One thing about being a man.

1045
01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:10.377
a man can never
stop being a man.

1046
01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:13.919
and I'm man enough
to step up and say.

1047
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:16.955
I'm sorry. I admit my wrong.

1048
01:14:23.964 --> 01:14:26.426
Life is not gonna
always be easy. Rayven.

1049
01:14:29.266 --> 01:14:30.672
We have to put forth

1050
01:14:32.137 --> 01:14:33.807
better effort to be
a better person

1051
01:14:36.141 --> 01:14:39.241
and good results
will show from that.

1052
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:47.821
This is me asking you
for your forgiveness

1053
01:14:50.727 --> 01:14:51.825
and to help me

1054
01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:55.961
become a better
father for you.

1055
01:15:00.638 --> 01:15:01.571
Did you kill her?

1056
01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:04.200
Your mother? No.

1057
01:15:05.071 --> 01:15:07.709
No. Jerome's mom.

1058
01:15:09.108 --> 01:15:13.616
Rayven. I have never
killed another soul.

1059
01:15:14.949 --> 01:15:17.620
Jerome's mother
was my close friend...

1060
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:21.954
and still is.

1061
01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:27.058
What do you mean
and she still is?

1062
01:15:29.227 --> 01:15:30.226
She's not dead.

Thank you.

1097
01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:22.074
You taught me a lot.
to be honest.

1098
01:17:23.011 --> 01:17:26.848
Not to be afraid.
to embrace it.

1099
01:17:31.888 --> 01:17:32.986
Why don't we get away?

1100
01:17:34.121 --> 01:17:35.549
You know. like.
maybe go to New York

1101
01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:37.056
since I've never been.

1102
01:17:37.091 --> 01:17:39.520
-You're really stuck
on this New York shit.

1103
01:17:39.555 --> 01:17:41.698
I am. Let's go.

1104
01:17:43.163 --> 01:17:46.164
-I'm down for it.
-Okay. Cool.

1105
01:17:48.333 --> 01:17:51.004
-You wanna leave tomorrow?
-All right.

1106
01:18:03.051 --> 01:18:05.183
Baby. I've been
texting my dad.

1107
01:18:05.218 --> 01:18:06.316
We talk.

1108
01:18:08.155 --> 01:18:10.221
Mainly because I needed
closure for myself.

1109
01:18:13.391 --> 01:18:14.390
That's good.

1110
01:18:19.034 --> 01:18:21.199
I asked him to meet me here.

1111
01:18:21.234 --> 01:18:23.971
Baby. I think
you two should talk.

1112
01:18:24.006 --> 01:18:27.975
-Talk about what. baby?
-Your mom.

1113
01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:31.044
Baby. to heal.
you have to be able

1114
01:18:31.079 --> 01:18:32.672
to face those who scarred you.

1115
01:18:33.818 --> 01:18:35.983
And even though he scarred me.

1116
01:18:36.018 --> 01:18:37.919
he has some unknown answers

1117
01:18:37.954 --> 01:18:39.987
that he could
probably help you with.

1118
01:18:40.022 --> 01:18:42.121
That man
can't help me with shit.

1119
01:18:45.225 --> 01:18:46.521
Baby. I forgave him.

1120
01:18:48.261 --> 01:18:49.865
Can you just try it for me?

1121
01:18:51.198 --> 01:18:52.098
Please?

1122
01:18:55.499 --> 01:18:56.399
Please.

1123
01:19:00.273 --> 01:19:01.107
Hey. Daddy.

1124
01:19:06.213 --> 01:19:08.510
I'm gonna
let you two talk. okay?

1125
01:19:08.545 --> 01:19:09.709
Baby. I'll be in the car.

1126
01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:23.525
I'm sorry. Jerome.

1127
01:19:25.364 --> 01:19:28.937
Us parents don't
always get it right.

1128
01:19:30.468 --> 01:19:31.599
Some do.

1129
01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:32.534
Some don't.

1130
01:19:35.803 --> 01:19:37.572
Shit. If I'm
going to be honest.

1131
01:19:38.377 --> 01:19:40.179
it has taken me some 30 years

1132
01:19:41.446 --> 01:19:43.248
and I'm still learning
how to be a father.

1133
01:19:47.386 --> 01:19:49.683
But one thing I do know
about your mother.

1134
01:19:50.994 --> 01:19:52.455
she is a fighter.

1135
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:54.655
Come on. man.
Stop talking
about my mother. man.

1136
01:19:57.297 --> 01:19:58.428
A fighter just like you.

1137
01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:05.171
I'm working on
having a better
relationship with Rayven

1138
01:20:07.274 --> 01:20:08.636
and hope that
includes you too.

1139
01:20:11.113 --> 01:20:13.850
My baby girl. she loves you.

1140
01:20:15.986 --> 01:20:17.678
And love is hard to come by.

1141
01:20:20.485 --> 01:20:21.583
Take it from me.

1142
01:20:32.563 --> 01:20:33.760
What's this. man?

1143
01:20:34.895 --> 01:20:37.335
It's the address
where your mother is.

1144
01:20:39.306 --> 01:20:41.504
Come on. man.
you come over here
to talk about my mother. yo?

1145
01:20:42.276 --> 01:20:43.473
My mother's dead. All right?

1146
01:20:48.579 --> 01:20:49.545
Your mother's not dead.

1147
01:20:51.417 --> 01:20:52.350
Go see her.

1148
01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:28.089
- You got everything?

1149
01:21:28.124 --> 01:21:31.587
Yeah. What the hell
you got in these bags?

1150
01:21:31.622 --> 01:21:32.654
We're going to
New York. right?

1151
01:21:35.263 --> 01:21:36.592
Remind me to change my shoes

1152
01:21:36.627 --> 01:21:38.231
-before I get out the car.
-All right.

1153
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:43.368
Jerome. I love you.

1154
01:21:43.403 --> 01:21:44.435
Girl. get in the car.

1155
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:47.009
-Jerome. I love you.
-I love you. too.

1156
01:22:05.326 --> 01:22:06.886
Which house is it?

1157
01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:09.130
It's this one right here.

1158
01:22:09.165 --> 01:22:10.593
You sure you don't
want me to go in with you?

1159
01:22:11.794 --> 01:22:12.694
I'm sure.

1160
01:22:13.268 --> 01:22:14.399
Okay.

1161
01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:16.137
I'll be right here
when you get back.

1162
01:22:16.172 --> 01:22:17.072
All right.

1163
01:22:43.023 --> 01:22:44.033
- Who at my door?

1164
01:22:53.704 --> 01:22:55.341
Oh. my God.

1165
01:22:55.376 --> 01:22:58.179
-Jerome. hey. baby.
-Don't touch me!

1166
01:22:59.039 --> 01:23:00.511
Well. you wanna come in?

1167
01:23:00.546 --> 01:23:02.414
No. I don't wanna come inside.

1168
01:23:02.449 --> 01:23:05.648
Now. Jerome. you listen here.

1169
01:23:05.683 --> 01:23:07.122
You need to lower your voice.

1170
01:23:07.157 --> 01:23:08.354
No. you listen to me.

1171
01:23:10.688 --> 01:23:12.556
How could you just
leave me like that?

1172
01:23:14.494 --> 01:23:16.824
All these years I'm out here
searching for somebody

1173
01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:18.826
who killed you.
and you're alive.

1174
01:23:21.061 --> 01:23:23.501
Did you even think
about searching for me?

1175
01:23:23.536 --> 01:23:24.568
I'm sorry.

1176
01:23:26.572 --> 01:23:28.539
-I wasn't there.

1177
01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:31.773
But I thought of you. though.

1178
01:23:31.808 --> 01:23:35.084
You...
You thought of me?

1179
01:23:38.386 --> 01:23:41.222
Why? Can you answer that? Why?

1180
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:45.292
I wasn't well. Jerome.

1181
01:23:45.327 --> 01:23:49.164
I couldn't take care of you.
I couldn't take care of
myself.

1182
01:23:49.199 --> 01:23:52.497
I wasn't good for myself.
for you. and nobody else.

1183
01:23:53.533 --> 01:23:54.994
You gotta understand.

1184
01:23:57.834 --> 01:23:58.668
I couldn't do it.

1185
01:24:00.067 --> 01:24:02.606
You don't know what
I've been going through.

1186
01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.037
You don't know how I feel.

1187
01:24:07.745 --> 01:24:10.548
That is not a good enough
answer for me.

1188
01:24:15.291 --> 01:24:16.224
Thank you. though.

1189
01:24:18.954 --> 01:24:21.460
-Thank you for nothing.

1190
01:24:23.057 --> 01:24:24.892

get back here right now.
