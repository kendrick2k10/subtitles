00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.107
Tomorrow we will bury
this one

4
00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:11.739
This Pipe Person.

5
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:19.830
Our messenger to Wah-kon-tah.

6
00:01:20.873 --> 00:01:26.128
It is time to bury this Pipe
with dignity...

7
00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:30.549
... and put away its teachings.

8
00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:34.428
The children outside listening...

9
00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:38.891
...they will learn another language.

10
00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:43.562
They will be taught by white people.

11
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.111
They will learn new ways...

12
00:01:51.654 --> 00:01:56.116
...and will not know our ways.

13
00:25:10.301 --> 00:25:13.137
Your name is Sun Hawk Woman.

14
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:23.001
He's not that smart...

15
00:33:23.877 --> 00:33:25.921
...but he's handsome.

16
00:33:27.047 --> 00:33:28.924
He looks like a snake.

17
00:33:29.633 --> 00:33:32.928
No. he looks like Coyote.

18
00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:35.556
Those Blue Eyes.

19
00:33:37.307 --> 00:33:41.311
His brother is handsome. too.
I like the brother more.

20
00:33:42.938 --> 00:33:45.023
That red haired rat?

21
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.989
Better than your possum
playing dead...

22
00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:54.575
...and lazing around the house.

23
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.328
He's a possum around you...

24
00:33:58.537 --> 00:34:00.748
...he's like a rabbit to me.

25
00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:04.084
Be quiet...!

26
00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:06.420
...Coyote's watching.

27
00:34:08.338 --> 00:34:10.507
He wants our money.

28
00:34:12.009 --> 00:34:13.302
Of course he wants money...

29
00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:16.346
...but he wants to be settled.

30
00:34:18.766 --> 00:34:20.893
He's not restless.

31
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.854
His Uncle has money...

32
00:34:23.979 --> 00:34:26.356
... it's not money he wants...

33
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.066
... he loves you.

34
00:45:06.788 --> 00:45:08.581
Did you see the Owl?

35
00:45:10.417 --> 00:45:11.292
No.

36
00:45:15.797 --> 00:45:17.882
When you do...

37
00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.720
...it's a sign that we are dying.

38
00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:25.598
Because... of you.

39
00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:30.895
You all marry white men.

40
00:45:32.939 --> 00:45:35.817
Our blood is getting white.

41
00:45:39.654 --> 00:45:41.781
Where's Anna?

42
00:45:42.866 --> 00:45:44.993
I want Anna.

43
00:45:45.285 --> 00:45:46.786
I'm here.

44
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:49.247
I don't want you.

45
00:45:49.831 --> 00:45:51.374
I want Anna.

46
00:46:33.708 --> 00:46:34.834
Are you laughing?

47
00:46:35.043 --> 00:46:36.544
Not yet... but...

48
00:46:44.719 --> 00:46:46.554
I brought blankets for Momma.

49
00:46:47.013 --> 00:46:48.806
You're drunk already?

50
00:46:49.015 --> 00:46:52.143
I'm still drunk from last
night. you woke me up.

51
00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:54.562
Don't let Momma see you this way.

52
00:46:54.562 --> 00:46:56.231
Don't fuss on me.

53
00:47:16.084 --> 00:47:18.086
Are you making threats?

54
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.195
Older sister. calm down.

55
00:49:58.287 --> 00:49:59.997
You're...

56
00:50:00.915 --> 00:50:02.959
...wild.

57
00:50:19.308 --> 00:50:23.813
You're my best blessing.

58
00:50:25.773 --> 00:50:27.984
I'm your favorite?

59
00:50:29.235 --> 00:50:30.695
Yes...

60
00:50:32.071 --> 00:50:37.201
...stay with me here.

61
00:51:33.633 --> 00:51:35.259
Don't go out tonight.

62
01:44:04.155 --> 01:44:09.494
You are of the Elder Sky People.

63
01:44:10.703 --> 01:44:12.205
Little Anna...

64
01:44:12.205 --> 01:44:16.125
... your name is Wah hre lum pa.

65
01:45:54.515 --> 01:45:56.309
Little sister.

66
01:51:46.158 --> 01:51:48.202
But I was just at my sister's.

67
01:51:48.452 --> 01:51:50.955
You and the kids stay
in the house.

68
01:56:40.244 --> 01:56:44.498
I want to go now because I
will not be alive much longer.

69
01:59:45.429 --> 01:59:46.847
I'm afraid.

70
02:38:12.317 --> 02:38:15.570
Are you real?

71
02:42:10.263 --> 02:42:12.765
Where's my husband?

72
02:42:22.066 --> 02:42:23.109
Are you real?

73
02:42:32.910 --> 02:42:35.455
Where's my husband?

74
02:49:09.557 --> 02:49:12.059
I'll take you home now.
