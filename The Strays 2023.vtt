- Is he?
- [Amanda] You have to teach me.

248

You'll have to teach me

- We could make a night of it.
- We could.

[man] He's a freethinker.

252
00:20:40.458 --> 00:20:41.791
He's talking about things

253
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:44.416
that the mainstream media
are scared to touch.

254
00:20:44.416 --> 00:20:45.583
He's hitting a nerve.

255
00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:49.750
"White flight."
That's how he phrased it on the podcast.

257
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.791
- What is it?
- [Ian] Can we talk about something else?

258
00:20:53.791 --> 00:20:57.583
It's when white people
flee urban areas for the suburbs.

259
00:20:57.583 --> 00:21:00.000
- Why are they fleeing?
- [Ian] Because they're uncultured.

260
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.875
[man] It has nothing to do with culture.

261
00:21:04.625 --> 00:21:07.083

Don't you think. Neve?

274
00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:41.833
Yes. Yes.

275
00:21:43.541 --> 00:21:44.958
Who did your hair like that?

276
00:21:46.125 --> 00:21:48.208
- Emily.
- [Ian] Where's your brother?

277
00:21:48.833 --> 00:21:49.958
[Mary] Basketball.

278
00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:52.875
I think it's time we made a move.
Was lovely.

279
00:21:52.875 --> 00:21:55.166
[Amanda] Yes.
Wouldn't want to overstay our welcome.

280
00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:56.291
Get ready for bed. darling.

281
00:21:58.833 --> 00:22:01.083

[tuts. sighs]

286
00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:19.416
[Ian] He attended basketball.
Had a great game. apparently.

287
00:22:19.416 --> 00:22:22.583
Uh. the others went for some food after
to celebrate the win.

288
00:22:22.583 --> 00:22:24.125
but Sebastian didn't attend.

289

See?

292
00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:34.125
There are people out to hurt us.
Out to bring violence against us.

510
00:37:38.208 --> 00:37:39.875
You found my tribe.

511
00:37:41.708 --> 00:37:42.541
Tribe.

512
00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:44.166
That's funny.

513
00:37:47.708 --> 00:37:49.083
You remind me of her.

Great.

519
00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:04.208
I worked a few period buildings abroad.

520
00:38:05.333 --> 00:38:06.541
You travel far?

521
00:38:06.541 --> 00:38:08.125
I've moved around a lot.

522
00:38:09.125 --> 00:38:10.833

527
00:38:18.041 --> 00:38:20.250
Some of my best days
were sat in the Kop end.

- I'm working there until I get on my feet.
- Okay.

540
00:39:17.625 --> 00:39:19.791
The glamour of insurance.

541
00:39:21.291 --> 00:39:23.916
- My dad certainly thinks so.
- I like your hair.

542
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:26.125
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

543
00:39:26.125 --> 00:39:28.041
I sometimes rock mine like that.

Sends the boys... wild.

545
00:39:32.625 --> 00:39:36.333
Cool. Uh...

Coconut oil.

548
00:39:42.083 --> 00:39:43.458
We should... hang sometime.

549
00:39:44.041 --> 00:39:45.416

- Sure.

550
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.833
Cool.

551
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:49.875
I'll Facebook you. You got an alias?

552
00:39:50.791 --> 00:39:52.875
Um. not quite an alias. Just Mary.

553
00:39:53.375 --> 00:39:56.083
Williams. With a hashtag at the end.

554
00:39:56.083 --> 00:39:57.708

A parking ticket. yes. Exactly.

I share the car with my wife.

That's the usual address.

566
00:41:00.833 --> 00:41:03.208
I'll just tear up the ticket. Great.

567
00:41:11.083 --> 00:41:12.333
[regular voice] Got the address.

568
00:41:12.833 --> 00:41:15.291
- She hasn't accepted my request.
- Just be patient.

569
00:41:15.291 --> 00:41:17.791
I can't look at her photos
unless she accepts it!

[Carl] Shouldn't let people
treat you like that.

Here's good.

- You got a light?
- Uh... I didn't think that...

597

687
00:50:50.833 --> 00:50:53.916
[Sebastian chuckles]
Yeah. there ain't no other Blacks around.

688
00:50:55.625 --> 00:50:58.041
No. I mean. I guess I'm kinda...

689
00:50:59.208 --> 00:51:01.125
- Yeah?
- My mum.

690
00:51:05.125 --> 00:51:06.333
I never met my parents.

691
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:19.583
What's she like?

692
00:51:20.541 --> 00:51:21.375
[Sebastian] Who?

693
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.083
Your mum?

694
00:51:25.208 --> 00:51:28.291
Thinks she's white.
Never says anything about her past.

695
00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:31.916
- The fuck?
- Anything Black. off limits.

696
00:51:42.875 --> 00:51:43.875
[Sebastian coughing]

697
00:51:45.041 --> 00:51:47.458
Shit. man. This weed is strong.

698
00:51:48.208 --> 00:51:49.166
Where'd you get it?

699
00:51:57.166 --> 00:51:58.916
[Carl] You think you'd survive that drop?

700
00:52:00.375 --> 00:52:01.375
Huh?

701
00:52:03.125 --> 00:52:04.625
Do you think you'd survive it?

702
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:06.583
Go on.

703
00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.666
- What?
- [tersely] Have a look.

704
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:14.083
Lean over the edge and have a look.

705
00:52:15.541 --> 00:52:17.541
- Why?
- I thought you were on this man shit!

706
00:52:20.583 --> 00:52:21.416
Stand up.

707
00:52:22.583 --> 00:52:23.541
Look over the edge.

708
00:52:24.166 --> 00:52:25.000
Now.

709
00:52:25.875 --> 00:52:26.750
That's an order.

710
00:52:53.958 --> 00:52:56.291
[Sebastian breathing deeply]

711
00:53:02.791 --> 00:53:04.791
[labored breathing]

712
00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:32.583
[Sebastian gasps]

713
00:53:37.041 --> 00:53:37.916
All right.

714
00:53:42.625 --> 00:53:43.583
Well done. bruv.

715
00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:45.333
Well done.

716
00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:48.333
Passed the test.

717
00:53:52.083 --> 00:53:53.875
Now you're ready for the next level.

718
00:53:55.125 --> 00:53:57.125
[cheering]

719
00:53:58.333 --> 00:54:02.500
[laughs] Listen. He missed a shot. Yeah?

720
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.583
[dialogue continues indistinctly]

721
00:54:09.583 --> 00:54:11.583
[metal playing through headphones]

722
00:54:25.708 --> 00:54:26.750
[music stops]

723
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:27.666
Hello?

724
00:54:49.541 --> 00:54:50.375
Sebas?

725
00:54:56.833 --> 00:54:59.708
- You need to stop picking on my bro.
- [whimpering]

726
00:55:02.958 --> 00:55:05.041
[Carl] Do it. Sebas. Do it now!

727
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:07.333
- [Sebastian breathes shakily]
- [bully snorts]

728
00:55:07.333 --> 00:55:09.416
[Carl] What the fuck are you waiting for?

729
00:55:09.416 --> 00:55:11.208
- [bully whimpers]
- [Carl] Do it!

730
00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:15.125
- [Sebastian breathing loudly]
- [bully whimpering loudly]

731
00:55:21.083 --> 00:55:21.916
[bone crunches]

732
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:30.583
[door shuts]

733
00:55:31.666 --> 00:55:33.083
[cartoon playing on TV]

734
00:55:41.458 --> 00:55:42.916
What's been goin' on here?

735
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:44.958
She has everything.

736
00:55:46.791 --> 00:55:48.083
She has it all.

737
00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:51.791
- Who?
- [Dione] We had a party here.

738
00:55:52.583 --> 00:55:55.750
Me and Mary. the favorite.

739
00:56:00.833 --> 00:56:01.916
You brought her here?

740
00:56:03.541 --> 00:56:04.708
What is wrong with you?

741
00:56:04.708 --> 00:56:06.541
- That wasn't the plan.
- Ah! Nothing!

742
00:56:07.041 --> 00:56:11.000
Nothing's wrong with me. okay?
I'm done pretending.

743
00:56:13.166 --> 00:56:14.000
[sighs]

744
00:56:29.041 --> 00:56:30.000
We should just go.

745
00:56:31.958 --> 00:56:33.333
We should up and leave now.

746
00:56:35.083 --> 00:56:35.958
We're not wanted.

747
00:56:39.333 --> 00:56:41.333
[Dione] We've been invited to the gala.

748
00:56:43.375 --> 00:56:44.416
So?

749
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:48.583
So...

750
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.541
I never got to go to prom.

751
00:57:06.416 --> 00:57:12.125
- <i>âª I see the sign âª</i>
- <i>âª Yeah âª</i>

752

<i>Yeah! âª</i>

764
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:49.208
Sure you wanna go through with this?

765
00:57:53.041 --> 00:57:53.875
'Course.

766
00:57:56.083 --> 00:57:57.000
I'm so happy.

767
00:57:58.166 --> 00:58:01.000
- [screaming]
- [Ian] Hey. hey. hey.

768
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.500
[screaming. shouting]

769
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.750
This is all you! It's all you!

770
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:07.000
Get off me! It's all you!

771
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.875
No! Why?!

772
00:58:08.875 --> 00:58:12.625
No. you didn't let me get one day!

773
00:58:12.625 --> 00:58:13.916
Get off me!

774
00:58:13.916 --> 00:58:16.000
One day!

775
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.500
[screams] No! Get off! [crying]

776
00:58:40.291 --> 00:58:41.208
Is it true?

777
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:49.583
Y...

778
00:58:50.583 --> 00:58:51.416
Yes.

779
00:58:53.958 --> 00:58:55.416
It's not what you think.

780
00:58:55.416 --> 00:58:56.708
Then how is it. Neve?

781
00:58:57.208 --> 00:58:59.833
It looks to me
like your two Black children just showed...

782
00:58:59.833 --> 00:59:01.208
- See?
- "See"?

783
00:59:01.958 --> 00:59:05.791
"See?" This is somehow on me?
You're. you're. you're gonna explain...

784
00:59:05.791 --> 00:59:09.500
- [Sebastian] Why didn't you tell us?
- They grew up with their father. He...

785
00:59:10.208 --> 00:59:11.625
He was a bad man. I...

786
00:59:13.458 --> 00:59:15.708
I had to escape. so I. I. I. just...

787
00:59:15.708 --> 00:59:16.625
[Ian] Left.

788
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.708
You just...

789
00:59:20.791 --> 00:59:21.625
left them.

790
00:59:22.666 --> 00:59:23.875
[disgusted] Who <i>are</i> you?

791
00:59:24.833 --> 00:59:26.625
- I'm. uh...
- This is fucked.

792
00:59:27.166 --> 00:59:31.083
- This is so. so fucked!
- Let her explain. Mum. tell us how...

793
00:59:31.083 --> 00:59:33.583
Don't make out
you would have been up for raising

794
00:59:33.583 --> 00:59:35.875
two <i>Black</i> children who weren't yours. Ian!

795
00:59:35.875 --> 00:59:38.250
- You never asked.
- Well. neither did you.

796
00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:41.000
No. No. that's not fair.

797
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.625
I could have. Um... Maybe?

798
00:59:42.625 --> 00:59:43.708
Exactly.

799
00:59:44.208 --> 00:59:45.583
Exactly. Ian.

800
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:48.125
The two worlds don't mix.

801
00:59:49.083 --> 00:59:50.125
And I. I. I...

802
00:59:50.625 --> 00:59:52.166
I did what I had to do.

803
00:59:52.791 --> 00:59:55.041
What fathers do all the time.

804
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.416
What do they want?

805
01:00:06.875 --> 01:00:08.583
No. they haven't gone about things

806
01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:10.041
conventionally.

807
01:00:14.958 --> 01:00:16.166
You never recognized them?

808
01:00:18.625 --> 01:00:20.208
It was 16. 17 years ago.

809
01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:21.625
[Sebastian] Oh. fuck.

810
01:00:22.583 --> 01:00:24.208
- Fuck. man!
- Stop it.

811
01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:25.750
- [Ian] That's enough.
- Please.

812
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:31.625
There is something that I have to do.

813
01:00:33.833 --> 01:00:35.750
I will explain everything afterwards.

814
01:00:47.666 --> 01:00:49.791
[woman] Hey. Can I get you guys anything?

815
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.125
- We're waiting on someone.
- [woman] Sure. sure.

816
01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:55.541
Just let me know
when your third party arrives.

817
01:01:18.666 --> 01:01:19.666
[door rattles]

818
01:01:37.333 --> 01:01:38.916
Hi. Hi.

819
01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:42.541
So sorry. I'm...

820
01:01:46.583 --> 01:01:49.416
Have you ordered anything?
Is there anything you want?

821
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.333
Take a seat.

822
01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:02.208
[sniffs. sighs] Thanks.

823
01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:10.583
- Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.
- [woman] Hey. team!

824
01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:13.750
Specials are at the bottom.
Can I get you anything to drink?

825
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:14.666
Vodka.

826
01:02:14.666 --> 01:02:15.791
Vod... Oh.

827
01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:19.833
- We don't stock alcohol...
- Just... Maybe just some tea.

828
01:02:21.333 --> 01:02:22.791
Guys? Tea?

829
01:02:22.791 --> 01:02:23.708
Whatever.

830
01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:26.458
Great. Bring a pot.

831
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.833
Wow.

832
01:02:39.625 --> 01:02:40.500
Look at you both.

833
01:02:41.875 --> 01:02:44.791
- I hardly recognized you.
- What happened to your accent?

834
01:02:44.791 --> 01:02:46.916
- Do you hate being Black?
- No.

835
01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:49.041
[Dione] That's what bro says.

836
01:02:49.541 --> 01:02:51.500
No. no. I'm a proud Black woman.

837
01:02:52.583 --> 01:02:53.416
Proud.

838
01:03:01.958 --> 01:03:03.250
Look. firstly.

839
01:03:04.541 --> 01:03:05.958
please let me apologize.

840
01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:08.583
I'm so sorry for my outburst. I...

841
01:03:09.333 --> 01:03:10.916
I don't know what came over me.

842
01:03:11.541 --> 01:03:13.458
I've been under
the most amount of stress. and...

843
01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:14.375
You...

844
01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:16.583
want to say sorry?

845
01:03:16.583 --> 01:03:17.541
Exactly.

846
01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:19.083
Exactly. Dione.

847
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:21.625
That's what I'm here to do.

848
01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:26.375
[spluttering] It hasn't been
a straightforward journey.

849
01:03:27.083 --> 01:03:29.708
There have been things
that have happened that...

850
01:03:30.625 --> 01:03:31.583
that drew my hand...

851
01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:33.500
- You never reached out.
- [Neve sighs]

852
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:38.208
You said you were going
to the hairdressers. 18 years ago.

853
01:03:38.208 --> 01:03:42.208
- Your father. he was a very dangerous man.
- You weren't exactly perfect either.

854
01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:44.958
I don't know if you remember
what it was like.

855
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.750
- On Coldharbour?
- Is that a trick question?

856
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:49.250
- [Neve] No. I...
- Why...

857
01:03:50.666 --> 01:03:54.208
- Why didn't you take us with you?
- I left you with your auntie.

858
01:03:54.208 --> 01:03:55.250
She gave us away.

859
01:03:55.791 --> 01:03:56.791
She didn't want us.

860
01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:59.708
[woman] Careful. guys!
The tea is super hot.

861
01:03:59.708 --> 01:04:02.916
- Don't want anybody to scald themselves.
- Would you fuck off!

862
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:05.583
Sure.

863
01:04:10.666 --> 01:04:11.791
[cracks his knuckles]

864
01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:20.958
You're both right.

865
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.625
It's unacceptable.

866
01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:27.083
I should have written.
I should have reached out.

867
01:04:27.708 --> 01:04:29.375
There are so many "should'ves."

868
01:04:29.958 --> 01:04:34.625
I can't imagine what you must think of me.
I'm still struggling to process it myself.

869
01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.375
Are we... going to move in?

870
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:38.875
To the big house?

871
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.125
[chuckles nervously] That's...

872
01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:44.333
that's a very important question.

873
01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:48.208
And I've been thinking
of how I can make things right.

874
01:04:50.291 --> 01:04:52.791
And it appears to me that. right now.

875
01:04:52.791 --> 01:04:56.000
it's important that you both
are able to get back on your feet.

876
01:04:56.583 --> 01:04:57.541
[bag unclasps]

877
01:04:58.125 --> 01:05:00.125
[paper rustling]

878
01:05:01.791 --> 01:05:03.083
I wish I could give more.

879
01:05:03.625 --> 01:05:05.791
Maybe I can. Down the line.

880
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:07.916
But here's a check.

881
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:10.041
For Â£20.000.

882
01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:16.166
- A check?
- Yes.

883
01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:18.708
If you go back to London.

884
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.791
it will give you a chance
to get back on your feet.

885
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:23.500
Until. uh...

886
01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:24.958
[Dione] Until...

887
01:05:26.916 --> 01:05:28.875
we... work it all out?

888
01:05:30.208 --> 01:05:31.041
Exactly.

889
01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:32.916
Exactly. Dione.

890
01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:36.916
Until we can find a way
to work it all out.

891
01:05:41.291 --> 01:05:43.333
Wow. Look at you both.

892
01:05:44.791 --> 01:05:46.708
How you've grown. [chuckles anxiously]

893
01:05:49.666 --> 01:05:52.208
I've broken it down
into two separate checks

894
01:05:52.708 --> 01:05:54.208
to avoid arguments.

895
01:06:06.541 --> 01:06:07.375
[Carl scoffs]

896
01:06:12.166 --> 01:06:13.416
[Carl inhales deeply]

897
01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:19.708
Thank you. Mum.

898
01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:53.000
[Neve] <i>There's no excuse for my behavior.</i>

899
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:56.083
I was...

900
01:06:57.666 --> 01:06:58.708
traumatized

901
01:06:59.875 --> 01:07:01.208
after the second birth.

902
01:07:01.833 --> 01:07:03.083
I never even wanted her.

903
01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:05.125
Dione.

904
01:07:06.916 --> 01:07:07.750
I was forced.

905
01:07:09.333 --> 01:07:11.833
Who knows what would have happened
if I'd stayed?

906
01:07:12.625 --> 01:07:13.791
If I'd be here now.

907
01:07:15.041 --> 01:07:16.250
If <i>you'd</i> be here. even.

908
01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:23.291
And so I ran.

909
01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:25.666
Escaped.

910
01:07:28.375 --> 01:07:29.583
It wasn't planned. I...

911
01:07:31.625 --> 01:07:33.625
I saw an opportunity. and I went for it.

912
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.208
All this

913
01:07:35.916 --> 01:07:37.833
is just restless curiosity.

914
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.958
People need to know who they are.

915
01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:46.250
Where they're from.
Like... on those programs.

916
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:49.375
It doesn't change anything here.

917
01:07:53.291 --> 01:07:54.500
They've gone.

918
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.583
For now.

919
01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:57.541
Back to London.

920
01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.458
They just went?

921
01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:04.208
Mmm.

922
01:08:05.708 --> 01:08:06.916
They decided to leave.

923
01:08:08.666 --> 01:08:12.041
- Will we ever see them again?
- Don't you even want to?

924
01:08:12.041 --> 01:08:13.750
All in good time.

925
01:08:16.583 --> 01:08:18.291
We need to heal a bit first.

926
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Don't we?

927
01:08:21.166 --> 01:08:22.666
Before jumping into all that.

928
01:08:25.541 --> 01:08:28.916
Now it's important to rebuild our defenses

929
01:08:28.916 --> 01:08:31.333
and remember that we love each other.

930
01:08:32.333 --> 01:08:33.541
That <i>this</i> is real.

931
01:08:34.833 --> 01:08:36.666
That I am real.

932
01:08:47.833 --> 01:08:48.875
Your mother's right.

933
01:08:50.208 --> 01:08:51.291
We are a family.

934
01:08:52.333 --> 01:08:54.541
Whatever happened before
doesn't change that.

935
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.333
There will be
many more conversations to come.

936
01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:01.291
Believe you me.

937
01:09:03.958 --> 01:09:04.958
But. for now...

938
01:09:07.333 --> 01:09:08.625
we have to stay together.

939
01:09:18.708 --> 01:09:19.708
[Neve sighs softly]

940
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:22.750
Mary.

941
01:09:32.791 --> 01:09:33.625
[Neve] Son?

942
01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:53.708
[dog barking in distance]

943
01:11:55.541 --> 01:11:56.666
[tool rattling]

944
01:12:41.416 --> 01:12:42.750
[door handle rattles]

945
01:13:19.583 --> 01:13:20.916
[extractor fan whirring]

946
01:13:39.083 --> 01:13:40.541
[chuckles softly]

947
01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:42.333
[water gushing]

948
01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:51.958
[TV narrator] <i>Together.
they can better defend their territory.</i>

949
01:13:51.958 --> 01:13:54.500
<i>Now this is... Gosh. this is...</i>

950
01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:57.500
[enthusiastically]
<i>This ring is astonishing!</i>

951
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.041
<i>It is one of the nicest...</i>

952
01:13:59.041 --> 01:14:01.666
<i>Oh my gosh. look at this ring!</i>

953
01:14:01.666 --> 01:14:03.500
<i>- Three quarters of a carat...
-</i> [laughs]

954
01:14:04.916 --> 01:14:06.666
[TV playing in distance]

955
01:14:18.583 --> 01:14:19.625
[water gushing]

956
01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:24.333
[Dione] Hey. Sebas.

957
01:14:31.375 --> 01:14:34.875
- [Dione] Think I might have a bath.
- [Carl] Have you got a clean towel?

958
01:14:35.708 --> 01:14:36.916
[Dione] Couldn't find any.

959
01:14:36.916 --> 01:14:38.250
[water gushing]

960
01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:42.208
[Neve] What are you doing.
taking a bath at this hour?

961
01:14:44.458 --> 01:14:45.500
They're downstairs.

962
01:14:57.208 --> 01:14:58.916
[Carl] Know where
the clean towels are kept?

963
01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:02.625
[Dione] I checked the cupboards
but couldn't find any clean ones.

964
01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:04.541
Right. okay.

965
01:15:04.541 --> 01:15:05.666
[gushing continues]

966
01:15:05.666 --> 01:15:07.500
You never mentioned you were coming round.

967
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.000
[Carl] It's Abigail's birthday.

968
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.500
We thought it would be a great idea
to bring it in together.

969
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.958
Maybe order Chinese.

970
01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:15.166
[Dione] I love Chinese food!

971
01:15:15.166 --> 01:15:17.333
[Carl] Sebas! What you sayin'. bro?

972
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.083
- Didn't mean to wake you.
- [Dione] Hey. M!

973
01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:21.250
Like your PJs.

974
01:15:22.041 --> 01:15:23.875
Hi. Ian. Guess what?

975
01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:25.500
It's my birthday!

976
01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.416
- Please. I know how you must be...
- [Dione] Where do you keep clean towels?

977
01:15:28.416 --> 01:15:31.708
[Carl] Is it washday. Mum? Ian. washday?

978
01:15:31.708 --> 01:15:33.750
- I know that you're angry...
- [Carl] Sis!

979
01:15:34.375 --> 01:15:35.750
Send the menu around.

980
01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:40.208
We'll do it like that. On me.

981
01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:42.291
It's a celebration.

982
01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:46.875
Mum.

983
01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:47.958
Mum!

984
01:15:49.083 --> 01:15:51.541
I like the hair.
You bringing it back to the '90s?

985
01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:53.625
[Neve panting. groans]

986
01:15:57.625 --> 01:15:59.041
[Carl] Chill.

987
01:15:59.041 --> 01:16:00.666
Or see what happens.

988
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:02.750
Chill.

989
01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:05.458
[Neve moans softly]

990
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:16.583
[Carl] Mmm!

991
01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:21.250
I'm going Singapore noodle
and sweet-and-sour chicken.

992
01:16:22.708 --> 01:16:23.708
Peking-style.

993
01:16:24.875 --> 01:16:27.916
Mary. go and get the house phone
so we can put the order in.

994
01:16:29.333 --> 01:16:30.208
You. Abs?

995
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Birthday girl.

996
01:16:36.541 --> 01:16:37.375
Ribs.

997
01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:38.791
[Carl] Nice.

998
01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:40.583
Very nice.

999
01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:42.625
- With?
- Chow mein.

1000
01:16:43.458 --> 01:16:44.375
Chicken chow mein.

1001
01:16:44.375 --> 01:16:45.666
Who's getting this down?

1002
01:16:46.625 --> 01:16:48.458
- Mary. you getting this?
- [Ian] Wait.

1003
01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:52.666
I was totally unaware
of what happened in the past with Neve...

1004
01:16:52.666 --> 01:16:54.333
You mean... Cheryl.

1005
01:16:58.208 --> 01:16:59.583
[Carl] You didn't know?

1006
01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:02.625
Oh... It was a terrible mix-up.

1007
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:06.541
It's all just been a terrible confusion.
I mean. I...

1008
01:17:06.541 --> 01:17:08.375
We don't condone what she did.

1009
01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:10.708
We demanded answers too.
like the two of you.

1010
01:17:10.708 --> 01:17:14.000
Now you. Sebas. I seen you on the court.
I know you got an appetite.

1011
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.708
- If we could just talk...
- Sebas!

1012
01:17:16.958 --> 01:17:18.916
- What is it. bruv?
- [water sloshing]

1013
01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:20.583
[Sebastian] Uh...

1014
01:17:23.166 --> 01:17:26.083
Prawn crackers and egg-fried rice.

1015
01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:28.166
Good. Very good.

1016
01:17:29.458 --> 01:17:31.500
Gonna be a feast. I like.

1017
01:17:33.166 --> 01:17:35.166
You lift weights? Ian.

1018
01:17:38.166 --> 01:17:39.666
I clocked a gym back there.

1019
01:17:39.666 --> 01:17:41.875
[mocking disbelief] A gym. you know?
In the house.

1020
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.208
We should do a family photograph.

1021
01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:48.208
[Carl] After we sorted the order.
we can do a family photo.

1022
01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:51.500
But it's my turn to be in the middle.

1023
01:17:52.583 --> 01:17:54.041
That's non-negotiable. Mary.

1024
01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:57.125
[Carl] Mum. what you going for?

1025
01:17:58.541 --> 01:18:02.625
- I'll just have a bit of everyone else's.
- You sure? I'm buying.

1026
01:18:04.833 --> 01:18:06.708
Mary. Phone 'em up.

1027
01:18:06.708 --> 01:18:08.125
[gushing continues]

1028
01:18:14.125 --> 01:18:15.125
[line ringing]

1029
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.125
[shakily] Shall I turn the water off?

1030
01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:30.083
Let it run.

1031
01:18:31.458 --> 01:18:33.625
Let it run and run.

1032
01:18:34.166 --> 01:18:35.375
[line still ringing]

1033
01:18:35.958 --> 01:18:37.791
[machine] <i>I'm sorry.
but we're currently closed.</i>

1034
01:18:37.791 --> 01:18:41.625
<i>Our opening hours are 12:00 to 11:00.
Monday to Sunday. Please call back later.</i>

1035
01:18:41.625 --> 01:18:42.625
No worries.

1036
01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:44.708
Don't watch that.

It's about a grand for each year. right?

1095
01:22:20.416 --> 01:22:21.750
You'd need to budget that.
