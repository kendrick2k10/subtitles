Where'd you find that?

30
00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.619
Promise you'd quit.

31
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.497
Yeah. Yeah. it's not so easy.
you know.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.334
ANDY: Wait. why are you awake.
Charlie?

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:12.627
CHARLIE:
Bad dream.

34
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.507
Me. too.

35
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.968
(sighs)
Do you want to talk about it?

36
00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.346
Put that down. please.

37
00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.974
Come on. that's not a toy.

38
00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.809
Come on.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:39.988
What's going on. sweetie?

41
00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.451
Daddy?

42
00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.536
Hmm?

43
00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.580
Something feels weird.

44
00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:51.624
In my body.

45
00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.752
I think we should go talk
to your mom about this.

46
00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:54.919
Uh. you know.

47
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.963
Not that thing.

48
00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.966
-The other thing.
-The other thing.

49
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.429
The bad thing.

50
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.723
Something's changing.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:11.019
(breathes deeply)

52
00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:13.646
You remember your tools?

53
00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:16.024
If you ever get nervous.
if you're ever scared...

54
00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.738
...you start to lose control.
what do you do?

55
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.491
(breathes deeply)

56
00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.785
Flowers.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:32.874
Clock.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.588
See. uh. forest.

CHARLIE:
Bunny.

61
00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.093
And sweet Charlie.

62
00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:45.845
The bad thing...

63
00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.014
it's been gone a long time.

64
00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.517
You're strong. Charlie.

65
00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.602
So you don't have to be afraid.

66
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.689
(whispers):
All right.

67
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.524
VICKY:
Hey. Is everything okay in here?

68
00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.734
Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:00.944
Peachy.

70
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.576

71
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.913
(Andy groans)

72
00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.874
I'm really hungry.

73
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.668
Who wants pancakes?

74
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.920
Pancakes?

75
00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.547
You want pancakes?

76
00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.049
-I want pancakes.
-No. you don't like pancakes.

77
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.926
(Charlie chuckles)

78
00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.679
Blueberries. what else?
Chocolate?

79
00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:28.930
-Mm-hmm.
-Chocolate?

80
00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.557
-Yeah.
-What else do you want?

81
00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:31.766
Um...

82
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.728
-Strawberries.
-VICKY: Coffee.

83
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.688
-ANDY: Coffee? Black coffee?
-CHARLIE: Orange juice.

86
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.115
WANLESS:
Thank you so much

87
00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:48.700
-for coming in today.
-ANDY: Mm-hmm.

88
00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.077
How are you enjoying college
so far?

89
00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.247
(clicks tongue)
Uh... I'm having fun.

90
00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.042
It's busy. Kind of more work
than I thought.

91
00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.251
I'm kind of homesick.

92
00:06:58.293 --> 00:06:59.753
WANLESS:
I'm just gonna ask you

93
00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.087
a few questions here.

94
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.214
-It's kind of background stuff.
-Okay.

95
00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.133
Ever used hallucinogenic drugs?

96
00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:06.760
Too scared.

97
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.636
Uh...

98
00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.598
I mean. it's college. man.
You know?

99
00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.558
WANLESS: How about
your father's blood type?

100
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.477
VICKY: Do you know
your parents' blood types?

101
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.604
WANLESS: You know what?
I don't. Fair enough.

102
00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:20.065
Where do your parents live?

103
00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.859
They don't.
They died when I was ten.

104
00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.611
WANLESS: Says here you were
raised in a group home.

105
00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.112
Is that correct?

106
00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:29.115
Indeed. I was. uh.
from the time that I was seven.

107
00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.658
MAN:
Numbers are in the threshold.

108
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.785
but let's keep an eye on it.

109
00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.036
WANLESS:
Telekinetic spikes.

110
00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.245
MAN:
Confirming here. too.

111
00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.622
VICKY:
Why do you need to know

112
00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:36.956
so much about my parents?

113
00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:38.708
WANLESS:
Genetic history.

114
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.128
It helps us understand
and evaluate the test results.

115
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.714
MAN: Slightly erratic.
but. uh. it's okay.

116
00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.257
WOMAN: We need to drop
his levels to five...

117
00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:49.594
The ad said that this was
just an FDA clinical trial.

118
00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.680
* *

119
00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.266
WANLESS: Half of the people
will be getting

120
00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.853
injections of water. and
the other half will get water

121
00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:02.899
mixed with a chemical compound
that we call "Lot Six."

122
00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.651
A chemical compound?

123
00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.653
-Like what? What is it?
-(static whines)

124
00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:11.199
But half of us are just
gonna get the placebo. right?

125
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.576
WANLESS: Either way.
it's entirely harmless.

126
00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:15.203
Well. how do you know?

127
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.205
I mean. that's why
you're testing it. right?

128
00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.585
* *

129
00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:26.589
WANLESS: My next question here
is a little weird.

130
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.258
Can you tell me
if you've ever had

131
00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:31.553
what you would call
an authentic psychic experience?

132
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.682
I'd rather not talk about that.

133
00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.183
MAN:
Okay. let's make sure

134
00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:38.893
we're recording
her numbers here.

135
00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.062
(papers rustling)

136
00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:44.065
Confirmed telekinetic activity.

137
00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:46.192
I don't like
these questions. man.

138
00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:48.862
(chuckles)

139
00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.656
WANLESS:
Just part of the evaluation.

140
00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.700
Let me ask you again.

141
00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:57.620
Have you ever experienced
any inexplicable phenomena

142
00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:00.832
that goes against natural law?

143
00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:03.251
I saw my parents die
in a car wreck.

144
00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:06.588
WANLESS:
I'm sorry to hear that.

145
00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.090
But what about that
makes it inexplicable?

146
00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:11.593
I saw it a week before
it actually happened.

147
00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.136
-(static crackles)
-MAN: The readings are erratic!

148
00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:14.387
WANLESS:
Turn it off.

149
00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.306
WOMAN:
We need to unhook him now!

150
00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.016
-WANLESS: Turn that camera off!
-(monitor beeping. flatlining)

151
00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:20.268
-(scientists clamoring)
-(woman sobbing loudly)

152
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.062
-WANLESS: Get him out of here.
-I still see it.

153
00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.147
(people screaming. clamoring)

154
00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.066
MAN:
Hold him down!

155
00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.859
WANLESS:
Turn it off. Turn it off!

156
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.944

157
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.989
(VCR clicks)

158
00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.329
ANDY: My service guarantees
that after just three sessions.

159
00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:41.998
your nicotine cravings
will disappear.

160
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.958
And all we do is talk?

161
00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.878
Sounds crazy. right?

162
00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.005
It's not.

163
00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.676
-It's magic.
-(chuckles) Okay.

164
00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:53.885
Uh. uh. I don't know. Mr. McGee.

165
00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.428
Well. call me Andy.

166
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.807
Andy. uh. a hundred dollars
per session...

167
00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.058
(inhales deeply)

168
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.768
Yeah. that's a lot
for my budget.

169
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.144
Let's just try it.

170
00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.437
One session.

171
00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:05.897
If you don't
walk out of here today

172
00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.440
feeling better than
you've ever felt.

173
00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.275
with these nicotine cravings
already starting to fade.

174
00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:10.902
it's on the house.

175
00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.904
Now. close your eyes.

176
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.407
(exhales heavily)

177
00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.702
Keep 'em closed.

178
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.120
Good.

179
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.956
Now. imagine the Darla
that you want to be.

180
00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.875
Picture her.

181
00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.210
Smoke-free.

182
00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.170
(soft rumbling)

183
00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:32.173
A beacon of respiratory health.

184
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.805
Now look at me in the eyes.

185
00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:41.474
* *

186
00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:44.144
Don't look away.

187
00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.895
No matter what.

188
00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.107
(high-pitched ringing)

189
00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.151
You feel better about
yourself already. Darla.

190
00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.694
-(echoing): Healthier.
-(pupil squelching)

191
00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.154
More positive. Healthier.

192
00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.989
You hate the taste of tobacco.
More positive.

193
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:58.992
And that stale cigarette smell
makes you want to puke.

194
00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:00.994
(heartbeat pulsing)

195
00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:04.831
You are done with smoking.

196
00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.958
(soft whoosh)

197
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.419
(high-pitched ringing)

198
00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:15.300
-(ringing fades)
-(chuckles) You know.

199
00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.843
I...

200
00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.887
I feel better already.

201
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.348
(whispers):
What?

202
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.099
-(clears throat)
-Wow.

203
00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.810
Healthier. more positive.

204
00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:28.313
(laughs)

205
00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.357
-Wow.
-Mm-hmm. (chuckles)

206
00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.359
Okay. um...

207
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.737
Okay. I have 75. but I can...

208
00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:37.447
I can give you
a credit card if you...

209
00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:39.407
No. it's-it's cash only.
so that's fine.

210
00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.451
-I'll just take
what you have now. -Oh.

211
00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:43.203
-Yeah? -Yeah. I'm sure
you're good for the rest.

212
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.830
-Oh. I am indeed.
-(chuckles)

213
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:46.831
Thank you.

214
00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:47.916
(both chuckle)

215
00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.501
(whispers):
Wild.

216
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.339
(chuckles) Take care.

217
00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:58.760
* *

218
00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:00.887
-(door closes)
-(exhales sharply)

219
00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:05.183
(pained grunting and breathing)

220
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.442
(shallow panting)

221
00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:25.036
(students chattering quietly)

222
00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.541
GAVIN:
Ew!

223
00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.126
Nice work. goober.

224
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.255
MS. GARDNER: How is it going
over here. Gavin?

225
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:38.049
-Weird girl killed our frog.
-It was already dead.

226
00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.093
Yeah. but now it's extra dead.

227
00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.178
MS. GARDNER:
That's okay. Charlie.

228
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.097
A quick Google search

229
00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.474
will show you all the frog guts
you want dissected perfectly.

230
00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.977
We don't even need
to do this anymore.

231
00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.311
I don't have Google.

232
00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.147
(students laughing)

233
00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.481
(snorts)

234
00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:56.192
Quiet. class.

235
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:59.112
(whispers):
I forgot. Sorry.

236
00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:00.947
You ever go
to the public library?

237
00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.074
You can use the computers there.

238
00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:05.577
Too much screen time can cause
health problems in children.

239
00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:06.619
like insomnia.

240
00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.375
I think a little screen time
would be just fine.

241
00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:13.626
Help with your grades. too.

242
00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:15.211
Okay.

243
00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.380
Now that we dissected our frogs.

244
00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.382
let's go back to the diagram

245
00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.967
and compare it with what we saw.

246
00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.552
-Now. notice the liver...
-(quietly): Hey.

247
00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:26.931
Is it true that Amish families
share the same bathwater?

248
00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:29.225
'Cause that's weird.

249
00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.269
And you're weird.

250
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.481
-(soft rumbling)
-(Ms. Gardner's voice fading)

251
00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:38.985
Notebook.

252
00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.070
Pencil.

253
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.321
Desk.

254
00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:42.447
Shoes.

255
00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:44.491
Paper.

256
00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:45.950
(soft whooshing)

257
00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:47.160
Eraser.

258
00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:48.203
-Calculator.
-(whooshing stops)

259
00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:49.412
Everything okay. Charlie?

260
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.125
Yes. Ms. Gardner.

261
00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.211
(birds chirping)

262
00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:03.093
(breathing shakily)

263
00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:07.430
(quiet knocking)

264
00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:09.182
-(gasps)
-(door opens)

265
00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:13.645
Charlie.

266
00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.563
Is everything okay in here?

267
00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.525
-(sniffles)
-(door closes)

268
00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:23.405
I don't want to go to school.

269
00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:25.949
(breathes deeply)

270
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.367
(grunts)

271
00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.079
We just want you
to have a normal life.

272
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:33.289
I want stupid Wi-Fi.

273
00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.375
That's normal.

274
00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:37.419
(crying softly)

275
00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.089
That stuff rots your brains.

276
00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:45.552
Do you really believe that?

277
00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.095
Mm-hmm.

278
00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:51.474
Plus. it's expensive. you know?

279
00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:55.103
Monthly bills. smartphones.

280
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:58.440
We just. you know...
we can't afford it right now.

281
00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:01.067
Sorry.

282
00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:04.404
It happened again.

283
00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:10.076
The bad thing.

284
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.163
This boy made fun of me.

285
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.999
(breath trembling)

286
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:17.959
He called me weird.

287
00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:20.462
You're not weird.

288
00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.130
(whispers):
I'm worse.

289
00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:24.716
No. No.

290
00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.968
You're special.

291
00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:29.262
(sniffles)

292
00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:32.974
I knew it
the day that you were born.

293
00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:37.604
You were warm and toasty
like a buttery muffin.

294
00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.982
* *

295
00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:44.778
VICKY:
Hmm?

296
00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.530
Are you scared of me?

297
00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.491
(sighs)

298
00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:53.620
(whispers): I could never
be scared of you.

299
00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:56.623
Come here.

300
00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.461
(sighs)

301
00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:09.302
Three years.

302
00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:11.137
We got... (sighs)
we got too comfortable.

303
00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:13.264
ANDY: I just don't get it.
Like. why now?

304
00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.141
What's the trigger?

305
00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.768
She's not in puberty.

306
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.395
-(scoffs)
-Is she?

307
00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:19.646
No.

308
00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:21.231
(sighs):
Oh. God.

309
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.238
It really scared her
when it happened.

310
00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:29.572
Maybe she needs
to be scared. Vick.

311
00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.533
-She needs to be trained.
-Oh. my God.

312
00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:33.618
Our responsibility
is getting her ready.

313
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.578
Making her strong
in case they come.

314
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.039
Our responsibility
is to protect her.

315
00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:39.457
Training her is protecting her.

316
00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.667
Says the one who hates
her power so much.

317
00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:43.169
-she won't even use it.
-Wha...

318
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.171
It's different for us.
We know what it's like...

319
00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.132
Be normal?

320
00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:49.259
But when you're born
this way... (stammers)

321
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.636
She's not a robot.
She's a little girl.

322
00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.346
With little girl feelings
and emotions.

323
00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:55.265
which are wildly unpredictable.

324
00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:56.808
It's too dangerous.

325
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.227
She just has to shove it down
and keep it hidden.

326
00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:00.812
She did it before.

327
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.857
She can do it again.

328
00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:06.192
(whistle blows)

329
00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.236
-(playful chatter)
-(shoes squeaking)

330
00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:31.509
(chuckles)

331
00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:34.763
GAVIN:
Ha-ha! Ha-ha!

332
00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:37.223
-Loser.
-(panting)

333
00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:38.850
(chuckles)

334
00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.352
Let's go.

335
00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:43.480
MS. GARDNER:
You okay. Charlie?

336
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.648
* *

337
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.650
Weirdo.

338
00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.736
(panting continues)

339
00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:54.115
GAVIN:
Yeah. run away. you freak.

340
00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.285
MS. GARDNER:
Charlie?

341
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.091
(steam hissing)

342
00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:16.680
Charlie?

343
00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.599
(water running)

344
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:22.352
* *

345
00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:39.577
Charlie?

346
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.920
What the...

347
00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.299
(Charlie breathing shakily)

348
00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.890
Please. Charlie?

349
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.935
Whatever's going on...

350
00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.313
-Charlie? (gasps)
-(door sizzles)

351
00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.400
CHARLIE:
Please leave.

352
00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:12.485
(crying softly)

353
00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.198
Charlie?

354
00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:22.704
-(door banging)
-(gasps)

355
00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:27.834
(banging continues faster)

356
00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.386
(screams)

357
00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.555
(steam hissing)

358
00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.600
(breathing shakily)

359
00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:45.602
* *

360
00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:47.687
(steam hissing)

361
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.864
Holy sh-shit.

362
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.828
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

363
00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:13.338
I was in the east end.
uh. of the school...

364
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.714
VICKY:
It won't happen again.

365
00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:16.800
How can you be so sure?

366
00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:21.513
Does Charlie have a history
of destructive behavior?

367
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.264
No. of course not.

368
00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:25.058
She's been less than forthcoming

369
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.643
about how she did it.

370
00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:30.522
What she used
to cause the explosion.

371
00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:31.898
Please don't call it
an explosion.

372
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.441
It makes her sound like
a terrorist.

373
00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.735
The bathroom stall
exploded. ma'am.

374
00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.696
What would you like us
to call it?

375
00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:41.866
Regardless. the police want to
investigate the matter further.

376
00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:47.414
That blast was like
a siren call.

377
00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:48.748
I know you don't want
to hear this.

378
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.291
but none of this
would have happened

379
00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:51.584
-if she knew how to use it.
-(scoffs)

380
00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:53.586
Jesus.

381
00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:55.422
Look at my eyes.

382
00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:57.924
Every time I try to do it.
it-it chips away at me now.

383
00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:00.927
I can't do the push without
my eyes literally bleeding now.

384
00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:02.679
Why didn't you tell me?

385
00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:04.764
(pants) Come on.

386
00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:06.641
But that doesn't mean
it will happen to Charlie.

387
00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:08.059
That's not a risk
I'm willing to take.

388
00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.439
I don't have your power.

389
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.690
Okay?

390
00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:15.400
I can't push her
if she loses control.

391
00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:17.485
Well. I would never push
my own kid.

392
00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:21.614
Our cover is blown. okay?

393
00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:24.492
If they catch her.
they're gonna lock her away.

394
00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:26.619
They're gonna run tests on her
for the rest of her life.

395
00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:28.913
They're gonna take her.
they're gonna put her in a cage.

396
00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:30.623
We'll never see her again. Vick.

397
00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:32.917
Who knows what's gonna
happen to her?

398
00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:35.754
If who catches me?

399
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.091
You're supposed to be
in your room. Charlie.

400
00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.552
You were yelling.

401
00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:47.015
Charlie. I need you to go
to your room right now. okay?

402
00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:49.059
And pack a bag.
We're leaving in the morning.

403
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.687
Sweetie. do you think--
Are we bad people. Charlie?

404
00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.398
Mm-mm.

405
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.900
ANDY: Do you know why
we have to move all the time?

406
00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.486
Hmm?

407
00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.154
Because of your work.

408
00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:04.491
But also because
bad men are after us.

409
00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:06.034
Really bad.

410
00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:08.036
Because of the special things
that we can do.

411
00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:10.038
the pushing and the fire.

412
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.707
And if they catch us.
they're gonna put us in jail.

413
00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:15.502
It's why we can't have
cell phones or Wi-Fi.

414
00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:17.545
Because they can track it.

415
00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:19.547
I'm sorry we lied to you.

416
00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:22.676
But I ran to the bathroom
so I wouldn't hurt anyone.

417
00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:24.511
That was the right thing
to do. Charlie.

418
00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:26.096
That was. that was right.

419
00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:28.932
I tried to throw it in
the water. but it didn't work.

420
00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:30.850
And now we're in trouble
and we're going to jail.

421
00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:32.185
and it's all my fault.

422
00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:33.770
-Okay. you got to stay calm.
-(panting)

423
00:22:33.812 --> 00:22:34.938
-Calm down. Charlie.
-Just stay calm. sweetie.

424
00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.439
-You're okay.
-I'm not okay.

425
00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:38.858
Stop saying that.
And I'm not special!

426
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.610
I'm a monster! (crying)

427
00:22:40.652 --> 00:22:42.153
-You are not a monster.
-You just need to calm down.

428
00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:43.905
-I'm a monster. I'm a monster.
-You're not. -Calm down.

429
00:22:43.947 --> 00:22:46.074
-You're not a monster.
-I'm a monster. I'm a monster!

430
00:22:46.116 --> 00:22:47.701
-(panting)
-Charlie.

431
00:22:47.742 --> 00:22:49.577
I hate living like this!

432
00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:51.496
Tough luck. Charlie!
This is who you are!

433
00:22:51.538 --> 00:22:53.832
Please. Andy. Stop.

434
00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:56.418
You made me this way. (crying)

435
00:22:56.459 --> 00:22:57.877
Charlie. please!

436
00:22:57.919 --> 00:23:00.046
I hate who I am. and I hate you!

437
00:23:00.088 --> 00:23:01.881
(screams) Charlie!

438
00:23:01.923 --> 00:23:03.633
(whimpering)

439
00:23:03.675 --> 00:23:05.552
Charlie!

440
00:23:06.553 --> 00:23:08.096
(both panting)

441
00:23:08.138 --> 00:23:10.807
You're all right. Oh. God.

442
00:23:10.849 --> 00:23:13.184
(whispers):
I'm really sorry. sweetie.

443
00:23:13.226 --> 00:23:15.979
CHARLIE:
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

444
00:23:16.021 --> 00:23:17.564
-I'm so sorry.
-Charlie.

445
00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:19.232
-Charlie. no. Charlie. no.
-(crying)

446
00:23:19.274 --> 00:23:20.859
-Charlie.
-(phone line ringing)

447
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.068
Charlie. no. I'll be okay.

448
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.862
(shushing)

449
00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:26.656
-(Vicky groans)
-(whispering): She's okay.

450
00:23:26.698 --> 00:23:27.991
DISPATCHER (over phone):
911. What is your emergency?

451
00:23:28.033 --> 00:23:30.577
-See? She's fine.
-(whimpers quietly)

452
00:23:30.618 --> 00:23:33.079
-Come on. Please.
-DISPATCHER: Hello?

453
00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:35.582
Hello?

454
00:23:35.623 --> 00:23:36.833
-Are you there...
-(phone beeps)

455
00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:38.710
Okay.

456
00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:41.004
It's okay. It's all right.

457
00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:44.007
(shallow breathing)

458
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.843
It's okay. It's all right.

459
00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:49.512
* *

460
00:24:11.868 --> 00:24:14.537
("Control. I'm Here"
by Nitzer Ebb playing)

461
00:24:20.335 --> 00:24:22.545
* I'm here *

462
00:24:28.677 --> 00:24:32.806
* We close our eyes.
we close our eyes *

463
00:24:32.847 --> 00:24:34.265
* Close them in your dreams *

464
00:24:34.307 --> 00:24:35.975
* Close them in your home *

465
00:24:36.017 --> 00:24:38.144
* I'm here to stay *

466
00:24:38.186 --> 00:24:41.064
* I won't go away *

467
00:24:41.106 --> 00:24:43.692
* You don't need me *

468
00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:45.735
* I'll slip away *

469
00:24:48.196 --> 00:24:50.907
* You can't hear me... *

470
00:24:50.949 --> 00:24:52.992
-(music stops)
-(phone buzzing)

471
00:24:58.164 --> 00:24:59.874
HOLLISTER (over phone):
Is this Rainbird?

472
00:24:59.916 --> 00:25:01.543
RAINBIRD:
Yes.

473
00:25:01.584 --> 00:25:03.962
HOLLISTER: This is
Captain Jane Hollister. DSI.

474
00:25:04.004 --> 00:25:06.840
I'm reactivating you. Rainbird.

475
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.344
If that would be of interest.

476
00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:13.263
Course it's still the cleaning
up other people's shit.

477
00:25:13.304 --> 00:25:15.557
just not literally.

478
00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:20.061
I left that life.

479
00:25:20.103 --> 00:25:22.939
Yeah. and how's that
working out for ya?

480
00:25:22.981 --> 00:25:24.691
I know what happened.

481
00:25:24.733 --> 00:25:28.069
Shop used you up and threw you
out like unwanted trash.

482
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.822
And that wasn't right.

483
00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:34.743
But that was the old guard.
I'm the new.

484
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:41.750
Something's happened. Rainbird.

485
00:25:41.791 --> 00:25:43.835
and I need it handled
with discretion.

486
00:25:43.877 --> 00:25:46.588
I understand
that was your specialty.

487
00:25:53.094 --> 00:25:54.804
What is the target?

488
00:25:57.849 --> 00:26:02.604
Something for which
you are uniquely qualified.

489
00:26:04.272 --> 00:26:06.900
But unlike the others.

490
00:26:06.941 --> 00:26:09.944
I need this quarry back alive.

491
00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:13.281
Is that something
you can handle?

492
00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:18.703
* *

493
00:26:25.794 --> 00:26:27.796
(crying)

494
00:26:30.298 --> 00:26:32.967
ANDY (whispers):
Good job. Good job.

495
00:26:38.431 --> 00:26:39.808
-There we go.
-(pained whimpering)

496
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:42.227
-You okay?
-Ow.

497
00:26:42.268 --> 00:26:45.438
-Ow. Ow. Oh.
-(sighs. grunts)

498
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.649
(pained sigh)

499
00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:49.901
Vick. this is bad.

500
00:26:49.943 --> 00:26:52.278
(pained grunting)

501
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.155
Oh. fuck.

502
00:26:54.197 --> 00:26:56.116
(whispers):
Almost done.

503
00:26:56.157 --> 00:26:58.201
(pained breathing)

504
00:27:00.036 --> 00:27:01.788
That's it.

505
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.374
You could've pushed her.

506
00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:06.251
We have no idea
what's happening when

507
00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:08.712
I'm going into those people's
minds. moving things around.

508
00:27:08.753 --> 00:27:10.338
Why would you ever want me
to do that to Charlie?

509
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.882
-What if I mess her up?
-And if she kills one of us?

510
00:27:12.924 --> 00:27:14.926
Don't fucking go there.

511
00:27:14.968 --> 00:27:16.469
-Andy.
-(groans)

512
00:27:16.511 --> 00:27:19.806
This is what happens
when you stuff it down.

513
00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:21.182
(whispers):
It doesn't go away.

514
00:27:22.767 --> 00:27:25.186
Can you take her to the movies
or something. please?

515
00:27:25.228 --> 00:27:27.022
Ice cream or something?

516
00:27:30.358 --> 00:27:32.944
(pained whimpering)

517
00:27:32.986 --> 00:27:35.155
-Just get some rest. okay?
-Okay.

518
00:27:35.196 --> 00:27:37.240
* *

519
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:56.885
(sniffling)

520
00:27:58.928 --> 00:28:00.972
(panting)

521
00:28:19.115 --> 00:28:21.159
* *

522
00:28:42.138 --> 00:28:44.182
* *

523
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.040
-(loud knocking)
-(shouts. gasps)

524
00:29:09.082 --> 00:29:11.126
(panting)

525
00:29:11.167 --> 00:29:12.919
(knocking)

526
00:29:22.512 --> 00:29:24.055
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

527
00:29:24.097 --> 00:29:25.056
Vicky McGee?

528
00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:26.516
I'm just following up

529
00:29:26.558 --> 00:29:29.227
on an emergency call
from earlier tonight.

530
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:30.395
Oh. yeah.

531
00:29:30.437 --> 00:29:32.480
It was a grease fire.

532
00:29:32.522 --> 00:29:33.815
On the stove.

533
00:29:33.857 --> 00:29:35.275
My daughter overreacted.

534
00:29:35.316 --> 00:29:37.444
If you or your daughter
need help...

535
00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:39.362
It's nothing like that.

536
00:29:40.655 --> 00:29:42.157
Honestly.

537
00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:48.121
You're sure about that.
you have a good night. then.

538
00:29:54.127 --> 00:29:55.337
(door closes)

539
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.506
(sighs)

540
00:30:04.054 --> 00:30:06.306
Oh. Charlie.

541
00:30:06.348 --> 00:30:09.392
Ow. (grunts. pants)

542
00:30:13.229 --> 00:30:15.273
* *

543
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:23.198
-(gasps)
-Where did they go?

544
00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:27.243
Your husband and the girl.

545
00:30:30.372 --> 00:30:32.457
-(grunts)
-(voice whispering. echoing)

546
00:30:32.499 --> 00:30:36.169
VICKY (echoing):
Ice cream. Movies.

547
00:30:36.211 --> 00:30:38.171
(Vicky gasps. whimpers)

548
00:30:39.214 --> 00:30:42.050
Ice cream...

549
00:30:42.092 --> 00:30:43.927
or the movies?

550
00:30:43.968 --> 00:30:45.136
(gasps)

551
00:30:45.178 --> 00:30:48.014
(panting)

552
00:30:48.056 --> 00:30:50.016
Did you think you were unique?

553
00:30:50.058 --> 00:30:53.645
Before they tested their poison
on pretty. young coeds.

554
00:30:53.687 --> 00:30:56.231
they had to use lab rats.

555
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.573
And you're out of practice.

556
00:31:07.075 --> 00:31:09.035
(panting)

557
00:31:09.077 --> 00:31:11.413
* *

558
00:31:18.086 --> 00:31:19.587
(soft rumble)

559
00:31:29.264 --> 00:31:31.307
(whimpering)

560
00:31:35.562 --> 00:31:37.063
(lock clicks)

561
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.941
(gasps)

562
00:31:43.778 --> 00:31:45.238
(panting)

563
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.657
How could you work for them?

564
00:31:47.699 --> 00:31:50.035
Help them
after what they did to you?

565
00:31:50.076 --> 00:31:52.662
Come peacefully.
and you'll live.

566
00:31:52.704 --> 00:31:55.457
I will die
before I let them have her.

567
00:31:55.498 --> 00:31:58.585
Your life. to them.
is a secondary concern.

568
00:31:58.626 --> 00:32:00.503
And yours?

569
00:32:02.172 --> 00:32:04.632
(grunts. screams)

570
00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:08.178
(panting)

571
00:32:08.219 --> 00:32:10.472
(screams)

572
00:32:13.224 --> 00:32:15.268
(panting)

573
00:32:24.652 --> 00:32:28.281
When you see her.
you'll understand.

574
00:32:28.323 --> 00:32:30.492
And you will regret.

575
00:32:30.533 --> 00:32:32.744
(Vicky panting)

576
00:32:41.503 --> 00:32:44.130
Do you think she'll forgive me?

577
00:32:44.172 --> 00:32:47.217
(breathes deeply)

578
00:32:47.258 --> 00:32:49.177
Well. she's your mom.

579
00:32:49.219 --> 00:32:51.429
She'll always forgive you.

580
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:53.348
No matter what.

581
00:32:56.685 --> 00:32:59.020
(quietly):
It was supposed to be you.

582
00:32:59.062 --> 00:33:00.355
What?

583
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.654
It was supposed to be you.

584
00:33:09.572 --> 00:33:11.032
(Charlie sighs)

585
00:33:21.209 --> 00:33:22.502
(Andy sighs)

586
00:33:22.544 --> 00:33:24.379
-(door closes)
-(lock clicks)

587
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.383
I feel weird.

588
00:33:28.425 --> 00:33:31.094
Mm. too much rocky road.

589
00:33:31.136 --> 00:33:32.387
She's probably asleep.

590
00:33:32.429 --> 00:33:33.513
I'm gonna go check on her. okay?

591
00:33:33.555 --> 00:33:35.432
Here. take that to the trash.

592
00:33:35.473 --> 00:33:37.517
And then throw on your pj's.
all right?

593
00:33:52.657 --> 00:33:55.493
* *

594
00:33:55.535 --> 00:33:57.537
(panting)

595
00:33:57.579 --> 00:33:58.747
Surrender.

596
00:33:58.788 --> 00:34:00.540
-ANDY: Charlie?
-Daddy?

597
00:34:00.582 --> 00:34:02.542
RAINBIRD:
No one gets hurt.

598
00:34:03.585 --> 00:34:05.295
-(neck cracks)
-(soft rumble)

599
00:34:06.755 --> 00:34:08.131
Let her go.

600
00:34:09.424 --> 00:34:11.468
You know what it costs.
don't you?

601
00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:14.137
To hurt someone.

602
00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:15.805
To take a life.

603
00:34:15.847 --> 00:34:19.100
Would you ask that
of your own child?

604
00:34:20.852 --> 00:34:23.730
-(soft crackling)
-Do you feel that?

605
00:34:23.772 --> 00:34:26.358
Let her go.
or it's gonna get a lot worse.

606
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:27.484
Where's Mommy?

607
00:34:27.525 --> 00:34:28.902
She has no aim without sight

608
00:34:28.943 --> 00:34:30.570
if she's like the rest of us.

609
00:34:30.612 --> 00:34:32.280
Where's my wife?

610
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.284
(Charlie panting)

611
00:34:36.326 --> 00:34:37.285
(sizzling)

612
00:34:37.327 --> 00:34:38.536
CHARLIE:
Where's Mommy?

613
00:34:41.414 --> 00:34:43.333
ANDY:
I don't know. sweetheart.

614
00:34:43.375 --> 00:34:44.834
RAINBIRD:
Yes. you do.

615
00:34:44.876 --> 00:34:47.128
Where's Mommy?! Tell me now!

616
00:34:49.464 --> 00:34:51.466
-(gasps)
-Mom?

617
00:34:52.384 --> 00:34:54.260
(grunting)

618
00:34:54.302 --> 00:34:55.470
(Charlie panting)

619
00:34:56.638 --> 00:34:58.139
(gasping)

620
00:34:58.181 --> 00:35:00.892
(screaming)

621
00:35:00.934 --> 00:35:02.560
(grunts)

622
00:35:02.602 --> 00:35:04.437
-Run.
-(glass breaking)

623
00:35:04.479 --> 00:35:05.522
Run. Charlie!

624
00:35:05.563 --> 00:35:08.358
(alarm blaring)

625
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.693
-Run!
-Mommy!

626
00:35:16.449 --> 00:35:18.660
(coughing)

627
00:35:18.702 --> 00:35:20.745
(alarm continues blaring)

628
00:35:26.501 --> 00:35:28.712
Come on. We have to get
somewhere safe.

629
00:35:28.753 --> 00:35:31.214
(tires squealing)

630
00:35:36.553 --> 00:35:38.596
* *

631
00:35:47.439 --> 00:35:48.773
(knocking)

632
00:35:48.815 --> 00:35:52.193
WOMAN:
Dr. Wanless. you have a guest.

633
00:35:54.029 --> 00:35:56.698
Good morning. Joseph.

634
00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.783
I brought you something.

635
00:36:00.535 --> 00:36:02.537
Your favorite colors. too.

636
00:36:09.502 --> 00:36:12.589
I'm Captain Hollister.
newly appointed DSI.

637
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.550
Why are you here?

638
00:36:15.592 --> 00:36:17.635
Hmm. Captain?

639
00:36:17.677 --> 00:36:20.847
I made calls
to your predecessor.

640
00:36:20.889 --> 00:36:22.599
They went unanswered.

641
00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.850
Hmm.

642
00:36:23.892 --> 00:36:27.854
But now they stuff a new face

643
00:36:27.896 --> 00:36:30.815
into the same old suit.

644
00:36:30.857 --> 00:36:33.735
and that face just comes

645
00:36:33.777 --> 00:36:36.237
knocking on my door!

646
00:36:36.279 --> 00:36:37.864
With all due respect. Doctor.

647
00:36:37.906 --> 00:36:41.284
Captain McConnell doesn't have
the legs for this outfit.

648
00:36:41.326 --> 00:36:43.411
Completely oblivious

649
00:36:43.453 --> 00:36:47.540
to the dire nature
of the situation we've created!

650
00:36:47.582 --> 00:36:48.667
We found them.

651
00:36:48.708 --> 00:36:50.502
Joseph.

652
00:36:50.543 --> 00:36:52.796
* *

653
00:36:52.837 --> 00:36:54.506
Shall we talk?

654
00:36:59.094 --> 00:37:02.055
(panting)

655
00:37:02.097 --> 00:37:05.892
VICKY: When you see her.
you'll understand.

656
00:37:05.934 --> 00:37:07.977
And you will regret.

657
00:37:10.063 --> 00:37:12.273
(birds chirping)

658
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:17.612
(vehicles passing)

659
00:37:19.739 --> 00:37:21.700
CHARLIE:
I miss you. Mommy.

660
00:37:21.741 --> 00:37:22.909
I'll get 'em.

661
00:37:45.557 --> 00:37:47.100
(sighs)

662
00:37:47.142 --> 00:37:48.685
(exhales sharply)

663
00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.773
* *

664
00:37:57.569 --> 00:37:59.612
(panting)

665
00:38:09.664 --> 00:38:10.999
(grunts softly)

666
00:38:14.961 --> 00:38:17.005
* *

667
00:38:21.634 --> 00:38:22.761
(laughing)

668
00:38:22.802 --> 00:38:23.803
-(screams)
-(laughs)

669
00:38:23.845 --> 00:38:26.348
-(panting)
-(screaming)

670
00:38:26.389 --> 00:38:27.766
(gasps)

671
00:38:31.019 --> 00:38:33.063
(panting softly)

672
00:38:43.531 --> 00:38:44.908
(panting)

673
00:38:44.949 --> 00:38:47.869
-Oh. hi. Hi. kitty-kitty.
-(meowing)

674
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:50.080
Hi.

675
00:38:51.414 --> 00:38:52.791
Come here. kitty-kitty.

676
00:38:52.832 --> 00:38:55.126
Come here. It's okay.

677
00:38:55.168 --> 00:38:56.753
Don't run away. Come on.

678
00:38:56.795 --> 00:38:59.422
-It's okay. I'm nice.
-(purring)

679
00:38:59.464 --> 00:39:00.507
I won't hurt you.

680
00:39:00.548 --> 00:39:02.008
(yowls)

681
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.468
(grunts)

682
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:05.637
(cat hisses. yowls)

683
00:39:06.638 --> 00:39:07.972
Charlie?

684
00:39:10.725 --> 00:39:12.394
Charlie?

685
00:39:13.228 --> 00:39:15.397
-(panting)
-(fire crackling)

686
00:39:15.438 --> 00:39:16.940
(cat meowing weakly)

687
00:39:16.981 --> 00:39:18.733
He scratched me.

688
00:39:23.113 --> 00:39:24.906
Honey. he's in pain.

689
00:39:26.449 --> 00:39:28.201
You have to put him
out of his misery. all right?

690
00:39:28.243 --> 00:39:29.661
(crying)

691
00:39:29.703 --> 00:39:31.788
I really didn't mean to.

692
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.915
-I know you didn't. I know.
-(sniffling)

693
00:39:34.916 --> 00:39:36.918
This is what it costs. though.

694
00:39:38.128 --> 00:39:39.713
(Charlie continues crying)

695
00:39:39.754 --> 00:39:42.090
'Cause it can't be
a reaction like that.

696
00:39:42.132 --> 00:39:44.718
-It's got to be a...
-(meows weakly)

697
00:39:44.759 --> 00:39:46.594
a decision.

698
00:39:46.636 --> 00:39:48.096
That's the only way
you can control it.

699
00:39:49.097 --> 00:39:50.849
You can do it.

700
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.603
(meowing weakly)

701
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:59.149
(breathes deeply)

702
00:40:01.568 --> 00:40:02.944
(fire sizzling)

703
00:40:02.986 --> 00:40:05.030
-(fire roars)
-(cat yowls)

704
00:40:07.032 --> 00:40:09.743
(Charlie crying)

705
00:40:11.745 --> 00:40:13.121
Good job.

706
00:40:18.501 --> 00:40:20.170
I want to help her.

707
00:40:20.211 --> 00:40:22.047
You want to use her.

708
00:40:22.088 --> 00:40:23.965
The girl--
she can't help what she is.

709
00:40:24.007 --> 00:40:28.136
She-- the poor thing. she's
been brain-fucked from birth.

710
00:40:28.178 --> 00:40:34.100
This is a chance to turn a past
failure into present success.

711
00:40:34.142 --> 00:40:38.146
I want you to come back
to work. Dr. Wanless.

712
00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:44.694
How hard must it have been
for them?

713
00:40:44.736 --> 00:40:47.655
The parents.
when the girl was born.

714
00:40:47.697 --> 00:40:50.241
The bottle is late.

715
00:40:50.283 --> 00:40:52.243
the baby cries.

716
00:40:52.285 --> 00:40:57.582
and a teddy bear
bursts into flames.

717
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.835
Right there.

718
00:41:00.877 --> 00:41:03.963
In the crib beside her.

719
00:41:04.005 --> 00:41:07.175
Can you imagine their fear?

720
00:41:08.218 --> 00:41:09.928
And it's awful. That's really--

721
00:41:09.969 --> 00:41:11.221
What's your point?

722
00:41:11.262 --> 00:41:16.267
The girl's power
is in its infancy.

723
00:41:18.103 --> 00:41:23.692
Terrible. yes. but trivial
compared to what's coming.

724
00:41:24.693 --> 00:41:29.531
But she's growing.
our little girl.

725
00:41:29.572 --> 00:41:33.660
She's becoming a young woman.

726
00:41:33.702 --> 00:41:38.540
And someday soon.
the power will grow. too.

727
00:41:38.581 --> 00:41:40.542
Perhaps it already has.

728
00:41:42.168 --> 00:41:45.213
And then. one day.

729
00:41:45.255 --> 00:41:47.716
she may be capable...

730
00:41:49.718 --> 00:41:53.930
...of creating
a nuclear explosion

731
00:41:53.972 --> 00:41:57.684
simply with the force
of her mind.

732
00:41:57.726 --> 00:42:00.353
Doctor. we built a facility

733
00:42:00.395 --> 00:42:03.023
especially for people
like Charlie.

734
00:42:03.064 --> 00:42:06.693
We can teach her.
We can train her.

735
00:42:06.735 --> 00:42:08.653
You can exploit her.

736
00:42:08.695 --> 00:42:10.864
Don't you lecture me
on morality.

737
00:42:10.905 --> 00:42:12.699
You developed Lot Six.

738
00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:14.117
You gave it to those kids.

739
00:42:14.159 --> 00:42:15.869
And it was a mistake!

740
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:17.954
Well. that's too fucking bad!

741
00:42:17.996 --> 00:42:19.831
It's done!

742
00:42:19.873 --> 00:42:21.291
-(sighs)
-Jesus fuck--

743
00:42:21.332 --> 00:42:23.084
We're not gonna clone her.

744
00:42:23.126 --> 00:42:25.170
We're not gonna make
a little army of Charlies.

745
00:42:25.211 --> 00:42:26.921
We just. we...

746
00:42:28.298 --> 00:42:30.925
We want to understand her.

747
00:42:34.262 --> 00:42:36.097
She's the first of her kind.

748
00:42:36.139 --> 00:42:39.976
And no one understands her
better than you.

749
00:42:40.018 --> 00:42:42.270
the man who made the serum.

750
00:42:42.312 --> 00:42:46.149
You're the father of it all.

751
00:42:46.191 --> 00:42:48.234
What do you say?

752
00:42:54.449 --> 00:42:59.329
There are none so blind
as those who will not see.

753
00:43:01.956 --> 00:43:03.166
What?

754
00:43:06.294 --> 00:43:09.297
Heed my words...

755
00:43:09.339 --> 00:43:11.049
very carefully.

756
00:43:13.301 --> 00:43:14.928
Terminate the girl.

757
00:43:14.969 --> 00:43:18.932
or one day
she will destroy us all.

758
00:43:18.973 --> 00:43:20.684
Do you hear me?

759
00:43:21.476 --> 00:43:24.187
Terminate her.

760
00:43:26.147 --> 00:43:29.651
I hoped
this would've gone better.

761
00:43:30.443 --> 00:43:32.654
(panting softly)

762
00:43:34.114 --> 00:43:36.074
That's good.

763
00:43:36.116 --> 00:43:38.159
-Can we pray?
-(sighs)

764
00:43:39.911 --> 00:43:42.914
Yeah. Sure. we can pray.

765
00:43:42.956 --> 00:43:44.666
(sighs) All right.

766
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.168
(sighs)

767
00:43:48.169 --> 00:43:50.797
Dear God.

768
00:43:50.839 --> 00:43:54.092
please let this... cat

769
00:43:54.134 --> 00:43:57.303
be happy in cat heaven.

770
00:43:57.345 --> 00:44:02.851
And. um. just. you know.
make sure that-that he. uh...

771
00:44:02.892 --> 00:44:04.436
or she...

772
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:07.105
...or they.

773
00:44:07.147 --> 00:44:10.984
it's like a big cat party
in cat heaven.

774
00:44:11.026 --> 00:44:12.861
And bless Mommy. too.

775
00:44:12.902 --> 00:44:15.280
* *

776
00:44:17.949 --> 00:44:19.701
(whispers):
Bless Mommy. too.

777
00:44:24.247 --> 00:44:26.332
You know what Mom
wanted you to learn

778
00:44:26.374 --> 00:44:28.376
more than anything in the world?

779
00:44:31.504 --> 00:44:34.215
She wanted you to learn
to use your power.

780
00:44:35.216 --> 00:44:37.093
Because it's incredible.

781
00:44:37.135 --> 00:44:39.304
And I bet if you have
her powers. you...

782
00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:42.807
...probably have mine. too.

783
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.063
-The push?
-Yep.

784
00:44:51.941 --> 00:44:54.194
It's serious stuff. Charlie.

785
00:44:54.235 --> 00:44:56.738
That's why Mom wanted
to teach you.

786
00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.741
to help you understand
how to use it.

787
00:45:01.159 --> 00:45:02.869
(sighs)

788
00:45:02.911 --> 00:45:05.246
If you do it too much.
it'll really hurt you.

789
00:45:05.288 --> 00:45:07.916
But I don't feel the heat
when it happens.

790
00:45:10.251 --> 00:45:12.295
It hurts you
on the inside. I mean.

791
00:45:14.255 --> 00:45:16.841
Actually...

792
00:45:16.883 --> 00:45:18.426
it feels kind of good.

793
00:45:26.935 --> 00:45:29.229
Why can't we drive our own car?

794
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:31.314
Because they're looking for us.

795
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.360
They won't really
put us in jail.

796
00:45:35.402 --> 00:45:37.112
Not you.

797
00:45:38.613 --> 00:45:40.156
They'll study you.

798
00:45:41.616 --> 00:45:43.326
Like the frog.

799
00:45:44.285 --> 00:45:45.870
Yeah.

800
00:45:46.955 --> 00:45:48.331
Yeah. like the frog.

801
00:45:50.083 --> 00:45:51.584
Here's one.

802
00:45:51.626 --> 00:45:53.545
Oh. come on. please. Yes!

803
00:45:55.547 --> 00:45:57.298
Okay.

804
00:45:58.258 --> 00:46:00.260
Do you really think
this is safe?

805
00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:03.054
Right now. I think
we have to get off this road.

806
00:46:03.096 --> 00:46:04.931
So... (sighs)

807
00:46:04.973 --> 00:46:06.808
Come on. We'll be smart.

808
00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:08.476
(music playing quietly
over truck stereo)

809
00:46:08.518 --> 00:46:10.395
Be clever. Let's go.

810
00:46:11.354 --> 00:46:13.023
Oh. man.

811
00:46:13.064 --> 00:46:14.524
I didn't think anyone
was gonna stop. (chuckles)

812
00:46:14.566 --> 00:46:17.235
There's a lot of weirdos
around these parts. (laughs)

813
00:46:17.277 --> 00:46:18.486
You one of 'em?

814
00:46:18.528 --> 00:46:20.447
No. no. no. we're very normal.

815
00:46:20.488 --> 00:46:22.490
Y-- Uh. tell the nice man
your name. sweetheart.

816
00:46:22.532 --> 00:46:25.368
I'm Roberta.
but they call me Bobbi.

817
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.078
ANDY: Yeah.
we're headed up to Boston.

818
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.164
My car broke down a ways back.

819
00:46:29.205 --> 00:46:30.999
Boston's a hell of a walk
from here.

820
00:46:31.041 --> 00:46:33.001
Yeah. I know.
We really got to get there.

821
00:46:33.043 --> 00:46:34.461
Is there any chance
you can take us?

822
00:46:34.502 --> 00:46:36.296
To Boston?

823
00:46:36.338 --> 00:46:38.381
I'll cover your gas.

824
00:46:38.423 --> 00:46:39.924
I got things to do.

825
00:46:39.966 --> 00:46:42.344
I got to check up on my wife.

826
00:46:42.385 --> 00:46:43.553
What about a hundred bucks?

827
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.975
-(high-pitched ringing)
-(soft rumbling)

828
00:46:49.017 --> 00:46:51.144
(heartbeat pulsing)

829
00:46:51.186 --> 00:46:53.396
(pupils squelching)

830
00:46:53.438 --> 00:46:55.357
(echoing):
One hundred bucks.

831
00:46:59.361 --> 00:47:00.528
(soft whoosh)

832
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:03.490
Well. I'm not above a Benjamin.

833
00:47:03.531 --> 00:47:06.242
(chuckles) Climb in.

834
00:47:07.243 --> 00:47:09.162
Hey. it's lunchtime.

835
00:47:09.204 --> 00:47:10.538
The wife and I usually put out

836
00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.415
a little sandwich spread
about now.

837
00:47:12.457 --> 00:47:15.001
Why don't you come to the house
and-and fuel up for a bit?

838
00:47:15.043 --> 00:47:17.337
I don't know. We...

839
00:47:17.379 --> 00:47:18.880
My wife's waiting.

840
00:47:22.133 --> 00:47:24.219
But Bobbi needs to eat.

841
00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.637
Yeah.

842
00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.181
Coming up.

843
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.184
* *

844
00:47:54.165 --> 00:47:56.209
* *

845
00:48:05.593 --> 00:48:07.971
-(sighs)
-Come on in.

846
00:48:08.013 --> 00:48:11.057
Let's get some food
in your bellies.

847
00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:13.435
Would it be okay
if I played with your chickens?

848
00:48:13.476 --> 00:48:16.563
Just watch out for the turds.
(chuckles softly)

849
00:48:17.564 --> 00:48:19.065
Yeah. sure.

850
00:48:19.107 --> 00:48:21.443
-Stay close. all right?
-Yep.

851
00:48:21.484 --> 00:48:23.403
Try not to cook any of them.

852
00:48:23.445 --> 00:48:26.239
(clucking)

853
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.077
(grunts softly. chuckles)

854
00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:32.537
* *

855
00:48:32.579 --> 00:48:34.622
(woman's voice whispering
indistinctly)

856
00:48:41.463 --> 00:48:44.049
IRV:
Essi! We're home.

857
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:46.968
Got some guests
for supper. Essi.

858
00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:49.971
Little Bobbi and her dad-- I
don't think I caught your name.

859
00:48:50.013 --> 00:48:51.473
Frank.

860
00:48:52.474 --> 00:48:54.267
Bobbi and Frank.

861
00:48:55.226 --> 00:48:57.270
-(refrigerator opens)
-(bottles rattle)

862
00:48:57.312 --> 00:48:59.230
Cold beer?

863
00:48:59.272 --> 00:49:00.732
Yeah. sure. Why not?

864
00:49:01.733 --> 00:49:03.068
Thank you.

865
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:07.030
So. what do you do. Frank?

866
00:49:07.072 --> 00:49:09.032
To keep the lights on.

867
00:49:09.074 --> 00:49:10.408
I'm a life coach.

868
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:11.618
No shit.

869
00:49:11.659 --> 00:49:14.204
-Like Tony Robbins on TV?
-No.

870
00:49:14.245 --> 00:49:16.414
-No. not really like that.
but... -(both laugh)

871
00:49:16.456 --> 00:49:20.251
I saw that documentary
on Netflix.

872
00:49:20.293 --> 00:49:22.212
Old Tony cusses like
a son of a bitch.

873
00:49:22.253 --> 00:49:25.048
but folks seem to like him.

874
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:26.633
People will give you
their life savings

875
00:49:26.675 --> 00:49:29.052
just to tell them
they're special.

876
00:49:29.094 --> 00:49:30.345
-Life coach?
-Yeah.

877
00:49:30.387 --> 00:49:32.347
Man. (laughs)

878
00:49:32.389 --> 00:49:35.100
The whole world goin' to hell.

879
00:49:37.686 --> 00:49:39.729
(woman's breath echoing)

880
00:49:43.775 --> 00:49:46.027
(distorted woman's voice
echoing)

881
00:49:50.824 --> 00:49:52.283
Hello?

882
00:49:54.494 --> 00:49:56.371
Is anyone in there?

883
00:50:13.763 --> 00:50:15.807
(rhythmic pulsing)

884
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.564
(panting softly)

885
00:50:27.861 --> 00:50:30.071
(panting)

886
00:50:32.866 --> 00:50:35.744
-(respirator pumping slowly)
-(labored breathing)

887
00:50:45.754 --> 00:50:47.505
What's your name?

888
00:50:48.506 --> 00:50:50.633
ESSI (echoing):
Essi.

889
00:50:51.593 --> 00:50:53.178
Hi. Essi.

890
00:50:54.929 --> 00:50:57.182
I'm Charlie.

891
00:50:57.223 --> 00:50:59.267
I'm here with my dad.

892
00:51:03.605 --> 00:51:04.773
Hey!

893
00:51:06.441 --> 00:51:08.109
How did you...?

894
00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:10.570
Don't go disturbing Essi!
She needs quiet!

895
00:51:10.612 --> 00:51:11.738
Hey. we're really sorry.

896
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.532
You've been more than kind.

897
00:51:14.574 --> 00:51:15.617
Come on.

898
00:51:16.618 --> 00:51:18.411
We should probably get going.

899
00:51:18.453 --> 00:51:20.246
Where you headed?

900
00:51:20.288 --> 00:51:22.582
And how you getting there?

901
00:51:23.875 --> 00:51:25.460
I don't know.

902
00:51:28.963 --> 00:51:30.674
Hey. look. I...

903
00:51:30.715 --> 00:51:33.385
I overreact sometimes.

904
00:51:33.426 --> 00:51:36.346
Especially with the missus.

905
00:51:36.388 --> 00:51:38.431
I apologize.

906
00:51:39.766 --> 00:51:41.643
Oh. how rude of me.

907
00:51:41.685 --> 00:51:43.687
Come on.

908
00:51:49.859 --> 00:51:52.737
Essi. this is Frank.

909
00:51:52.779 --> 00:51:55.490
And I guess
you already met Roberta.

910
00:51:56.449 --> 00:51:59.202
She was making a left turn
out on Route 14.

911
00:51:59.244 --> 00:52:01.705
and some a-hole ran a light.

912
00:52:01.746 --> 00:52:03.373
She never saw it coming.

913
00:52:03.415 --> 00:52:05.208
I'm so sorry.

914
00:52:06.543 --> 00:52:08.586
We lost our boy that day. too.

915
00:52:10.797 --> 00:52:12.799
But Essi's still alive.

916
00:52:12.841 --> 00:52:15.844
and for that.
I'm more than grateful.

917
00:52:19.806 --> 00:52:21.766
You can stay here till you go.

918
00:52:21.808 --> 00:52:23.893
We'd enjoy the company.

919
00:52:25.854 --> 00:52:27.856
-(crickets chirping)
-(night birds calling)

920
00:52:30.817 --> 00:52:32.819
Will they find us?

921
00:52:32.861 --> 00:52:35.530
You let me worry about that.

922
00:52:35.572 --> 00:52:38.700
The most important thing
we can do is just keep running.

923
00:52:38.742 --> 00:52:40.952
If they do. I can hurt them.

924
00:52:42.495 --> 00:52:46.750
(breathes deeply)

925
00:52:46.791 --> 00:52:49.586
I'll only hurt bad people.
I promise.

926
00:52:51.379 --> 00:52:53.381
The day you were born.

927
00:52:53.423 --> 00:52:55.467
Do you remember that story?

928
00:52:56.926 --> 00:52:58.970
Mommy said
I was a buttery muffin.

929
00:52:59.012 --> 00:53:00.764
Oh. my gosh. you were.

930
00:53:00.805 --> 00:53:03.808
You were just
a little buttery muffin.

931
00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:07.979
There's more to that story.

932
00:53:08.021 --> 00:53:11.649
It was so cute
how warm you were.

933
00:53:11.691 --> 00:53:14.903
but pretty soon. your
body temperature just went...

934
00:53:14.944 --> 00:53:16.529
(whooshes)

935
00:53:16.571 --> 00:53:17.947
Shot off the charts.

936
00:53:17.989 --> 00:53:19.908
And the doctors.
they were all...

937
00:53:19.949 --> 00:53:21.242
they were all confused.

938
00:53:21.284 --> 00:53:23.244
They were. uh...

939
00:53:23.286 --> 00:53:24.788
They didn't know
what could cause this.

940
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:27.832
so we stayed up with you
all night.

941
00:53:27.874 --> 00:53:29.542
All day.

942
00:53:29.584 --> 00:53:31.670
I could barely keep
my eyes open.

943
00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:33.713
I was falling asleep everywhere.

944
00:53:33.755 --> 00:53:34.923
(chuckles softly)

945
00:53:39.636 --> 00:53:41.930
And that's when they took you.

946
00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.558
I used to get
these premonitions.

947
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.686
this really weird.
weird feeling.

948
00:53:47.727 --> 00:53:50.397
Like how I did at the house.

949
00:53:50.438 --> 00:53:51.523
Mm-hmm.

950
00:53:51.564 --> 00:53:55.694
I could sense where you were.

951
00:53:55.735 --> 00:53:57.404
I could see you.

952
00:53:57.445 --> 00:53:59.531
And I found you.

953
00:53:59.572 --> 00:54:00.949
What did you do?

954
00:54:05.453 --> 00:54:06.830
(sighs softly)

955
00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.875
* *

956
00:54:10.917 --> 00:54:13.670
-(cooing)
-(chuckles softly)

957
00:54:13.712 --> 00:54:15.005
(soft rumbling)

958
00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:20.051
I was so angry
at what they had done.

959
00:54:20.093 --> 00:54:22.345
I snapped.

960
00:54:22.387 --> 00:54:25.056
-(heartbeat pulsing)
-(fussing)

961
00:54:25.098 --> 00:54:27.308
(echoing):
When your partner comes back.

962
00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:29.769
you're gonna shoot him
in the chest.

963
00:54:29.811 --> 00:54:31.896
And then you're gonna forget
how to breathe.

964
00:54:33.815 --> 00:54:35.942
And I hurt those men.

965
00:54:38.653 --> 00:54:39.738
(cries out)

966
00:54:39.779 --> 00:54:42.490
(gasping. wheezing)

967
00:54:47.662 --> 00:54:51.791
And those guys.
they probably had wives.

968
00:54:51.833 --> 00:54:53.418
Kids.

969
00:54:55.003 --> 00:54:56.546
That they loved.

970
00:54:56.588 --> 00:54:59.841
Just like I love you.

971
00:54:59.883 --> 00:55:01.092
And I do. Charlie.

972
00:55:01.134 --> 00:55:03.428
I love you so much.

973
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:05.513
But when you hurt people...

974
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:08.808
...you don't just hurt them.

975
00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:10.852
It hurts everyone around them.

976
00:55:12.395 --> 00:55:14.731
You don't come back from that.

977
00:55:16.858 --> 00:55:18.651
Not ever.

978
00:55:22.155 --> 00:55:24.783
Okay. promise me
that you'll never

979
00:55:24.824 --> 00:55:26.868
use your gifts to hurt people.

980
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.119
Promise?

981
00:55:29.621 --> 00:55:30.955
Promise.

982
00:55:32.707 --> 00:55:34.959
(sighs)

983
00:55:35.001 --> 00:55:36.503
Now. sleep.

984
00:55:36.544 --> 00:55:38.672
Get some sleep. all right?

985
00:55:39.923 --> 00:55:42.008
Come here.

986
00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:43.927
-Love you.
-Love you.

987
00:55:45.512 --> 00:55:48.932
(breathes deeply)

988
00:55:51.142 --> 00:55:53.395

Hey. Irv.

1016
00:57:13.224 --> 00:57:14.642
It's not true.

1017
00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:17.687
I didn't kill my wife.

1018
00:57:18.688 --> 00:57:21.024
You know I didn't kidnap

1019

you were a goddamn wife killer!

1025
00:57:37.999 --> 00:57:39.584
I didn't kill her.

1026
00:57:39.626 --> 00:57:40.710
Does my daughter seem
upset with me in any way?

1027
00:57:40.752 --> 00:57:42.003
Does she seem scared of me?

1028
00:57:42.045 --> 00:57:43.672
I'm trying to protect her.

1029
00:57:43.713 --> 00:57:45.131
I'm trying to protect her
from them.

1030
00:57:45.173 --> 00:57:48.593
You telling me
I-I can't trust the TV?

1031
00:57:48.635 --> 00:57:50.512

I know what happened.

1037
00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:07.529
What are you talking about?

1038
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:09.739
You were driving that day.
and you were arguing.

1039
00:58:09.781 --> 00:58:12.200
It got out of control.
and you hit a car head-on.

1040
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.829
That's how she got hurt.

1041
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:18.206

Essi told me.

1043
00:58:21.793 --> 00:58:23.628
Told you?

ANDY:
That's why they're after us.

1045
00:58:28.049 --> 00:58:29.843
But there's something else.

1046
00:58:29.884 --> 00:58:33.555
Something she's been wanting
to tell you for 30 years.

1047
00:58:36.182 --> 00:58:38.643
She forgives you.

1048
00:58:38.685 --> 00:58:41.688
You've hated yourself
all this time.

1049
00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:43.773
It was an accident.

1050
00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.945
And she forgives you.

1051
00:58:48.987 --> 00:58:51.281
(sobs)

1052
00:58:54.826 --> 00:58:56.995
(vehicles approaching)

1053
00:58:57.037 --> 00:58:58.997
What is that?

1054
00:58:59.039 --> 00:59:00.165
Uh. I called them.

1055
00:59:00.206 --> 00:59:02.000
(sighs) The police.

1056
00:59:02.042 --> 00:59:04.627
When I s-saw the news.

1057
00:59:04.669 --> 00:59:06.338
Oh. my God.

1058
00:59:06.379 --> 00:59:10.091
Like I said.
I-I overreact sometimes.

1059
00:59:10.133 --> 00:59:12.093
(panting softly)

1060
00:59:16.097 --> 00:59:18.099
* *

1061
00:59:22.312 --> 00:59:23.980
-You two hide.
-(car door closes)

1062
00:59:24.022 --> 00:59:25.357
I-I'll take care of this.

1063
00:59:25.398 --> 00:59:26.900
What are you talking about. Irv?

1064
00:59:26.941 --> 00:59:29.069
You're drunk.

1065
00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:30.779
(sighs)

1066
00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:32.864
Ought to make this
interesting. then.

1067
00:59:32.906 --> 00:59:34.741
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

1068
00:59:34.783 --> 00:59:36.076
Aaron Jeffery Cooper!

1069
00:59:36.117 --> 00:59:38.787
-Surrender!
-IRV: Hide in there.

1070
00:59:38.828 --> 00:59:41.956
PERRY: Girl inside.
hands on top of your head!

1071
00:59:43.458 --> 00:59:45.168
Come on out. now.

1072
00:59:47.295 --> 00:59:48.963
Mr. Cooper!

1073
00:59:54.302 --> 00:59:56.763
Hey. I-I'm sorry. Wendell.

1074
00:59:56.805 --> 00:59:58.765
I was mistaken.

1075
00:59:58.807 --> 01:00:01.726
I thought I saw the man
and the girl. but I was wrong.

1076
01:00:01.768 --> 01:00:04.938
You sounded pretty convinced
on the phone. Irv.

1077
01:00:04.979 --> 01:00:07.273
Y-You know. just last month.

1078
01:00:07.315 --> 01:00:12.028
I saw this documentary on TV
about. um.

1079
01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:15.824
uh. I-I can't recall
the exact name.

1080
01:00:15.865 --> 01:00:19.869
but i-it was something like
"walking dreaming."

1081
01:00:19.911 --> 01:00:24.958
There was this guy on there
dreamt he swallowed a cockroach

1082
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.670
-and he jumped up and made
himself puke. -(Andy shushing)

1083
01:00:28.712 --> 01:00:30.797
-It seemed so real.
-(whispering): It's all right.

1084
01:00:30.839 --> 01:00:32.799
-(panting)
-(shushes)

1085
01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:35.218

-No. Charlie. Charlie.
-(panting rapidly)

1087
01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:38.888
Hey. stay with me.

1088
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:41.850
-Just breathe. Breathe.
-(panting slows)

1089
01:00:41.891 --> 01:00:42.976
Breathe. That's right.

1090
01:00:43.018 --> 01:00:44.352
(breathes deeply)

1091
01:00:44.394 --> 01:00:46.104
I feel something.

1092
01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:47.313
What?

1093
01:00:49.274 --> 01:00:51.276
Someone's here.

1094
01:00:51.317 --> 01:00:53.862
You saying you called us out
on account of a dream?

1095
01:00:53.903 --> 01:00:55.280
IRV:
A pretty convincing one. too.

1096
01:00:55.321 --> 01:00:58.116
Uh. uh. the news was on.

1097
01:00:58.158 --> 01:01:00.326
I-I drifted off. and...

1098
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.830
...and I'm drunk.

1099
01:01:03.872 --> 01:01:05.457
Want to know what I think?

1100
01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:08.293
Not particularly.

1101
01:01:08.335 --> 01:01:11.129
I think we're here.
and this man Cooper.

1102
01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:12.839
he's considerably dangerous.

1103
01:01:12.881 --> 01:01:14.966
So even if you were
just dreaming it. Irv.

1104
01:01:15.008 --> 01:01:16.301

I'm so sorry.

1121
01:02:17.904 --> 01:02:20.281
Charlie. do you remember
what I taught you?

1122
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:23.284
-Keep running.
-Yeah.

1123
01:02:33.253 --> 01:02:34.838
I love you. Daddy.

1124
01:02:34.879 --> 01:02:36.548
I love you. too. sweetheart.

1125
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:37.924
Now. run.

1126
01:02:37.966 --> 01:02:39.968

Gotcha.

1139
01:04:00.048 --> 01:04:02.258
They will never stop
until they have her.

1140
01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.177
You'll never catch her.

1141
01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:05.428

LEAD AGENT:
On your knees! Move in.

1150
01:04:33.415 --> 01:04:35.375
-Move!
-Careful.

1151
01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:36.626

-(neck cracks)
-(soft rumbling)

1153
01:04:39.963 --> 01:04:41.381
Give me your gun.

1154

No dice. freak.

AGENT (over radio):
Negative.

1158
01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.391
We're checking
the other structures.

1159
01:04:51.433 --> 01:04:53.435
We found the owners inside.

1160
01:04:53.476 --> 01:04:55.520

(crying)

1164
01:05:21.212 --> 01:05:23.173
You lost her. Rainbird.

1165
01:05:23.214 --> 01:05:25.300
You left a trail of dead cops
in your wake.

1166
01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:27.093
You call that discretion?

1167
01:05:27.135 --> 01:05:28.595
You have the father.

1168
01:05:28.636 --> 01:05:30.013
So she's just gonna what?

1169
01:05:30.055 --> 01:05:31.723
She's gonna feel her way here?

1170
01:05:31.765 --> 01:05:33.475
They are connected.

1171
01:05:33.516 --> 01:05:35.060
She will come for him.

1172
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.648
Retirement has made you
sloppy and soft.

1173
01:05:43.234 --> 01:05:45.320
Is that why you blindfold me?

1174
01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:48.531
(door closes)

1175
01:05:48.573 --> 01:05:51.993
I don't need to see your eyes
to feel your fear.

01:05:57.123 --> 01:05:59.167
You don't know what I feel.

1177
01:06:01.503 --> 01:06:04.255
She will come for him.

1178
01:06:04.297 --> 01:06:06.132
She will come for us all.

1179
01:06:06.174 --> 01:06:09.135
She is my sister.

1180
01:06:09.177 --> 01:06:11.012
My mother.

1181
01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:14.683
Well. you killed her mother.

1182
01:06:16.184 --> 01:06:18.228
She will be your death.

1183
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:20.313
A fate which I deserve.

1184
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:25.527
When you see her.
you will understand.

1185

No more running.

1202
01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:42.354
It's just you and me now.

1203
01:07:51.237 --> 01:07:52.697
Wake up.

1204
01:07:59.913 --> 01:08:04.584
Rainbird-- the man
who killed your poor wife--

you and your daughter.

1206

you have some kind of
a spiritual connection.

1207

Telepathy.

1208
01:08:16.846 --> 01:08:19.224
Lot Six is full of surprises.

1209

Tell me where she is.

Charlie is out there all alone.

1211
01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:31.319
Without you. her emotions
will get the best of her.

1212
01:08:31.361 --> 01:08:33.655
And what happens
when she gets upset?

1213
01:08:33.697 --> 01:08:35.448
She gets scared.

1214
01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:39.494
She is going to blow some
poor bastard to smithereens.

1215
01:08:39.536 --> 01:08:41.287
She's gonna be killing people.

1216
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:43.915
How's she gonna live with that?

1217
01:08:46.751 --> 01:08:48.670
Bring her here.

1267
01:14:16.623 --> 01:14:19.125
(car door opens)

1268
01:14:19.167 --> 01:14:20.919
(car door closes)

1269
01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.505
It's you.

1270
01:14:24.714 --> 01:14:26.758
Take your hand off the key.

1271
01:14:28.677 --> 01:14:30.679
Give me your phone.

1272
01:14:34.015 --> 01:14:35.558
And the card.

1273
01:14:44.109 --> 01:14:46.027
Do you have a gun...

1274
01:14:47.862 --> 01:14:49.864
-...Agent Jules?
-No.

1275
01:14:49.906 --> 01:14:52.951
Uh. I'm just a tech.
They don't let us carry guns.

1276
01:14:52.992 --> 01:14:54.703
This says you're an agent.

1277
01:14:56.246 --> 01:14:58.998
JULES: We're all agents.
It's just... just a title.

1278
01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.959
Is my father inside?

1279
01:15:02.335 --> 01:15:03.878
-I don't know.
-(door handle rattling)

1280
01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.672
-CHARLIE: Is he?
-I don't know.

1281
01:15:05.714 --> 01:15:07.298
I swear. okay? I don't have
that kind of clearance.

1282
01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:09.009
I don't want to hurt you. sir.

1283
01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:10.635
Please. why are you doing this?

1284
01:15:10.677 --> 01:15:12.178
Is my father inside?

1285
01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.264
I don't know! Okay?

1286
01:15:14.305 --> 01:15:16.224
Stop. Please.

1287
01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:19.019
If he's here. he'll be. uh.
he'll be at the bottom.

1288
01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.353
Who else is in there?

1289
01:15:20.395 --> 01:15:23.690
JULES:
Computer techs. s-scientists.

1290
01:15:23.732 --> 01:15:25.191
uh. that kind of thing.

1291
01:15:25.233 --> 01:15:27.569
No long-haired men?

1292
01:15:29.696 --> 01:15:30.697
Answer me!

1293
01:15:30.739 --> 01:15:32.115
JULES:
Please. just--

1294
01:15:32.157 --> 01:15:34.117
Okay. just stay calm.

1295
01:15:34.159 --> 01:15:36.870
-We can work something...
-(echoing): Tell me!

1296
01:15:36.911 --> 01:15:38.580
No!

1297
01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:45.211
(panting)

1298
01:15:49.215 --> 01:15:51.217
You said you didn't have a gun.

1299
01:15:51.259 --> 01:15:54.637
(breathing weakly. wheezing)

1300
01:15:56.056 --> 01:15:58.350
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I promised.

1301
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:02.270
He's in pain. Charlie.

1302
01:16:03.271 --> 01:16:06.274
You'll have to put him
out of his misery.

1303
01:16:06.316 --> 01:16:09.235
This is what it costs.

1304
01:16:09.277 --> 01:16:12.739
(fire crackling. roaring)

1305
01:16:13.907 --> 01:16:16.076
(Jules screams)

1306
01:16:16.117 --> 01:16:18.286
(panting)

1307
01:16:20.705 --> 01:16:23.041
What's going on?

1308
01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:24.834
Ah. shit.

1309
01:16:24.876 --> 01:16:26.086
(radio beeps)

1310
01:16:26.127 --> 01:16:28.254
We got a disturbance
in the east lot.

1311
01:16:28.296 --> 01:16:29.756
All units stand by.

1315
01:16:50.902 --> 01:16:52.821
She's inside the building.

1316
01:16:52.862 --> 01:16:54.656

to the restricted level now.

1317
01:17:03.498 --> 01:17:05.834

1318
01:17:06.835 --> 01:17:08.753
(gasps)

1319
01:17:09.462 --> 01:17:11.131
What the...?

1320
01:17:11.172 --> 01:17:13.216
Oh. come on. come on.

1321

1324
01:17:49.127 --> 01:17:50.337

01:18:37.967 --> 01:18:39.844
(lens clicks)

1332
01:18:39.886 --> 01:18:42.263

1335
01:18:48.853 --> 01:18:50.772

1338
01:18:54.943 --> 01:18:56.319
She's all yours. Cap.

1339
01:18:59.489 --> 01:19:00.865
(Charlie gasps)

1340
01:19:04.369 --> 01:19:06.121
Daddy!

1341
01:19:07.163 --> 01:19:09.165
Daddy. wake up!

1342
01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:11.543
(pounding continues)

1343
01:19:11.584 --> 01:19:13.461
Daddy. wake up.

1344
01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:17.007
Charlie?

1345
01:19:18.216 --> 01:19:19.884
Wh-Why-Why are you here?

1346
01:19:20.927 --> 01:19:24.014
I came. I got your message.

1347
01:19:24.055 --> 01:19:25.473
(sighs)

1348
01:19:27.142 --> 01:19:29.561
That wasn't me. Charlie.

1349
01:19:29.602 --> 01:19:31.062
(gasps)

1350
01:19:33.314 --> 01:19:35.316
ANDY:
I would never bring you here.

1351
01:19:36.985 --> 01:19:38.945
That wasn't me.

1352
01:19:38.987 --> 01:19:41.281
-But I can get you out.
-No.

1353
01:19:41.322 --> 01:19:43.616
No. Charlie.

1354
01:19:43.658 --> 01:19:46.286
There's no getting out.

1355
01:19:46.327 --> 01:19:48.038
(groans softly)

1356
01:19:48.079 --> 01:19:50.331
-There's no getting out for me.
-HOLLISTER: Charlie.

1357
01:19:51.332 --> 01:19:53.918
It wasn't supposed to be
this way.

1358
01:19:54.919 --> 01:19:57.380
Wasn't supposed to be
this difficult.

1359
01:19:58.590 --> 01:20:00.342
Stay calm. dear.

1360
01:20:00.383 --> 01:20:03.470
If you try to burn me.
you'll burn your daddy. too.

1361
01:20:03.511 --> 01:20:06.056
My name's Captain Hollister.

1362
01:20:06.097 --> 01:20:08.933
but you can call me Cap.

1363
01:20:08.975 --> 01:20:10.977
I run this facility.

1364
01:20:11.019 --> 01:20:13.021
You can trust me. Charlie.

1365
01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:16.649
You'll be safe here.
You'll be protected.

1366
01:20:16.691 --> 01:20:20.487
We'll take really good care
of you and your father.

1367
01:20:20.528 --> 01:20:22.322
My dad needs a doctor.

1368
01:20:22.364 --> 01:20:25.158
HOLLISTER: They've seen him
already. Charlie.

1369
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.659
Microhemorrhages.

1370
01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:30.455
His brain bleeds
when he uses his power.

1371
01:20:32.665 --> 01:20:34.584
The same thing could happen
to you. too. Charlie.

1372
01:20:34.626 --> 01:20:37.629
but we can teach you.

1373
01:20:37.671 --> 01:20:40.006
-It's what your mother wanted.
-No.

1374
01:20:40.048 --> 01:20:41.257
No.

1375
01:20:42.217 --> 01:20:45.053
Call a doctor right now.

1376
01:20:45.095 --> 01:20:47.347
or I'll hurt myself.

1377
01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:52.143
Don't do it. Charlie.
Don't do it.

1378
01:20:54.688 --> 01:20:56.898
Call a doctor right now.

1379
01:20:57.732 --> 01:20:59.275
Do it!

1380
01:21:12.372 --> 01:21:15.083
You're a very determined
young lady.

1381
01:21:15.125 --> 01:21:17.711
Use it wisely.
it'll take you far in this life.

1382
01:21:17.752 --> 01:21:19.421
I should know.

1383
01:21:19.462 --> 01:21:21.715
You do bad things here.
I can feel it.

1384
01:21:21.756 --> 01:21:23.091
No. we-we do great things.

1385
01:21:23.133 --> 01:21:24.300
We make things better here.

1386
01:21:24.342 --> 01:21:26.177

We make them stronger.
people like you.

1388
01:21:29.305 --> 01:21:30.640
Haven't you realized?

1389
01:21:30.682 --> 01:21:35.061
You are a real-life

1390
01:21:35.103 --> 01:21:37.272
superhero.

1391
01:21:37.313 --> 01:21:39.441
Daddy.

1392
01:21:40.567 --> 01:21:42.610
You're very special.

1393
01:21:46.114 --> 01:21:47.699
The world out there--

1394
01:21:47.741 --> 01:21:51.161
they don't know
how to handle your power.

1395
01:21:52.162 --> 01:21:54.289
Here. we can handle it.

1396
01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:57.208
Because we made you.

1397
01:22:00.795 --> 01:22:02.255
Look at your father.

1398
01:22:02.297 --> 01:22:03.673
(stifled grunt)

1399
01:22:05.383 --> 01:22:08.261
They say
if he does one more push.

1400
01:22:08.303 --> 01:22:10.430
it might kill him.

1401
01:22:10.472 --> 01:22:13.016
You need us.

1402
01:22:13.058 --> 01:22:15.518
I don't want to hurt anyone.

1403
01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:18.563
I-I know you don't. honey.
I know.

1404
01:22:21.316 --> 01:22:23.360
But we can't run anymore.

1405
01:22:23.401 --> 01:22:25.111
I need you
to break your promise.

1406
01:22:25.153 --> 01:22:27.197

01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:41.461
Burn it all down.

1413
01:22:41.503 --> 01:22:44.172
-It's the only way.
-Easy. Easy.

1414
01:22:45.674 --> 01:22:47.467
