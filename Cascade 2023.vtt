Great. Thank you.

354
00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:47.663
-Stay safe. Enjoy the park.
-[Em] Thank you.

355
00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:50.040
That guy's definitely got
a huge dick or something.

356
00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:51.083
[all laugh]

357
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.796
[indistinct chattering]

358
00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:16.066
[Vince] Holy shit. man.

359
00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.820
If you let me drive.
I can get us there a lot faster.

360
00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:22.322
No. you are not driving. I swear to God.

361
00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:24.366
My dad used to take me hunting here.

362
00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:25.659
It's really easy to get lost.

363
00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:30.497
What?

364
00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:32.749
He wasn't always a criminal psychopath.

365
00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.668
I had a childhood. you know.

366
00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:39.506
It's just. we never really hear you
talk about him like that.

367
00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:42.175
Yeah. well. didn't say
it was a long childhood.

368
00:21:43.885 --> 00:21:46.930
All right. come on. seriously.
Give me the keys. Stop fucking around.

369
00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:48.640
Okay.

370
00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:51.143
Fine. but if you scratch it once…

371
00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:54.021
Then you'll have it
looking new in no time. all right?

372
00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:55.355
So. don't worry about it.

373
00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:57.232
Fucker.

374
00:21:58.692 --> 00:21:59.651
And hey.

375
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:03.196
I'll take care of Gam-Gam's car.
all right now?

376
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.073
-You better.
-Oh. yeah.

377
00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.535
[Alex] Please don't kill us.

378
00:22:09.036 --> 00:22:10.787
-[Jesse] Don't be an idiot!
-[horn honks]

379
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:12.414
[Vince] All right. buckle up. people.

380
00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:14.499
-[engine revs]
-[horn honks]

381
00:22:41.234 --> 00:22:43.487
Hi. there. How you folks doing today?

382
00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:46.239
Coming to take in the sights?

383
00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:49.618
Well. it's a beautiful day for it.

384
00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:51.536
[Vince] Woo!

385
00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:10.597
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

386
00:23:16.853 --> 00:23:18.188
Here you go. Bucko.

387
00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:19.940
There's no service.

388
00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:23.193
I'm over this already.

389
00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:24.152
Epic.

390
00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:32.327
Okay.

391
00:23:35.163 --> 00:23:37.958
Welcome to Vince's
wild wilderness adventure!

392
00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:40.585
Come on. Let's go!

393
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:42.379
-It's this way!
-[Em] Okay.

394
00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:47.342
Hey. super trooper. you plan on
waiting for the rest of us?

395
00:23:48.301 --> 00:23:50.846
[indistinct chatter]

396
00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:09.865
[Alex] Hold up!

397
00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:11.658
You want us to go in there?

398
00:24:12.325 --> 00:24:13.243
What's wrong?

399
00:24:14.035 --> 00:24:16.204
Big "no entry" sign doesn't give it away?

400
00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:18.248
That's for like animals and shit.

401
00:24:18.331 --> 00:24:20.542
Yeah. but only for the ones that can read.

402
00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:29.342
[Jesse] Hey. come here.

403
00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:32.512
-Okay. let's go. I got you.
-[Alex exclaims]

404
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:34.181
-[Jesse] Woo!
-[Alex exclaims]

405
00:24:38.351 --> 00:24:39.603
[indistinct conversation]

406
00:24:41.938 --> 00:24:43.523
[Vince] Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

407
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:45.483
-[Jesse] Come on.
-[Vince] Step it up.

408
00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:47.319
[Em] Hey. can we just…

409
00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:53.491
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

410
00:24:53.575 --> 00:24:55.368
-Do you need water?
-No. it's okay.

411
00:24:59.873 --> 00:25:00.832
Sure.

412
00:25:12.802 --> 00:25:13.803
[Alex] It's okay.

413
00:25:13.887 --> 00:25:14.930
You can finish it.

414
00:25:15.972 --> 00:25:16.848
Do you wanna go back?

415
00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:17.849
[sniffles]

416
00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:19.809
Back in time. maybe.

417
00:25:27.108 --> 00:25:28.735
I think I might be pregnant.

418
00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:31.196
Whoa.

419
00:25:32.405 --> 00:25:33.365
Like for real?

420
00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:35.367
Like for real.

421
00:25:35.825 --> 00:25:37.202
Well. did you take a test?

422
00:25:37.827 --> 00:25:39.246
No. but I'm late.

423
00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:42.666
Okay. But it could be something else.
You don't know for sure.

424
00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:46.294
I'm supposed to go
to the doctor next week.

425
00:25:47.462 --> 00:25:49.130
Don't suppose you'd come with me?

426
00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:51.591
Me?

427
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.844
Yeah. of course. if you want. But…

428
00:25:56.846 --> 00:25:57.722
what about Vince?

429
00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:00.725
He doesn't know and you can't tell him.

430
00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:02.852
I'm serious. Swear.

431
00:26:04.854 --> 00:26:05.814
I swear.

432
00:26:09.442 --> 00:26:11.236
I don't know. Like. do I wait?

433
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:14.948
And now he says he wants to join the army.

434
00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:16.074
The fucking army?

435
00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:18.702
Yeah. he did say that.

436
00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:23.456
And if I tell him. he's gonna think
I'm trying to trick him into staying.

437
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:24.874
Well…

438
00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:27.168
would you keep it?

439
00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:32.674
I work part-time
as a coat check girl at the casino.

440
00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:34.467
What do you think?

441
00:26:36.052 --> 00:26:36.886
[Jesse] Hey!

442
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.723
Hey! You guys gotta see this.

443
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.394
[Vince] Let's go.

444
00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:48.481
Come on.

445
00:27:02.704 --> 00:27:04.539
[Vince laughs] Woo!

446
00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:08.626
-I told you it'd be epic!
-[Alex] Holy shit!

447
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:09.961
This is fucking crazy!

448
00:27:10.045 --> 00:27:13.381
I've never seen them from this high.
or this close. This is insane!

449
00:27:14.174 --> 00:27:16.009
Jesse. you think I can make it?

450
00:27:16.426 --> 00:27:17.927
Maybe if you grew wings.

451
00:27:19.512 --> 00:27:21.014
You heard the ranger.

452
00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:23.016
water's way deeper now.

453
00:27:23.099 --> 00:27:24.893
[Em] Tell me you're fucking joking.

454
00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:30.648
-[Alex] Vince.
-[Em] Don't be stupid. You're not jumping.

455
00:27:30.732 --> 00:27:32.275
Vince. you would never make it. okay?

456
00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:33.485
[Alex] Yeah. you'd die.

457
00:27:33.568 --> 00:27:34.569
-Don't do it.
-Vince.

458
00:27:34.652 --> 00:27:35.862
-Vince. stop.
-[Alex] Vince!

459
00:27:35.945 --> 00:27:37.530
-Vince!
-No. no. no. Don't do it.

460
00:27:37.614 --> 00:27:39.783
[Vince] Woo! Oh. shit!

461
00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:42.452
All right. Yeah.
that's pretty fucking high.

462
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:43.995
Yeah. no shit.

463
00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:46.081
[Em] Okay. cut it out.

464
00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:48.666
-Vince!
-[Jesse] Fucking stop. Stop!

465
00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:51.628
-[Em] Vince! Vince!
-[Jesse] No. no. no!

466
00:27:52.462 --> 00:27:54.047
What the fuck?

467
00:27:55.548 --> 00:27:56.758
Fuck!

468
00:27:57.217 --> 00:27:59.219
-[Em] Vince?
-[Alex] Vince!

469
00:27:59.302 --> 00:28:00.303
Vince!

470
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:02.597
There's no way.

471
00:28:07.602 --> 00:28:10.188
-Always playing games.
-He's just messing with us.

472
00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:11.815
Well. he's an asshole.

473
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.404
Vince! Vince?

474
00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:21.533
Vince!

475
00:28:21.908 --> 00:28:24.077
Do you think he went in
and the current took him?

476
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.621
-No way he jumped the falls.
-Vince!

477
00:28:26.704 --> 00:28:28.498
He better not be fucking around.

478
00:28:28.998 --> 00:28:29.999
Vince!

479
00:28:48.017 --> 00:28:49.352
-[Em] Vince!
-[Alex] Vince!

480
00:28:49.436 --> 00:28:50.687
[Jesse] Vince!

481
00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:53.189
Vince! You scared the shit out of me!

482
00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:54.816
Not fucking funny. man.

483
00:28:56.985 --> 00:28:57.986
Where are you going?

484
00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:02.532
[Alex] Oh. my God!

485
00:29:02.615 --> 00:29:04.784
[Jesse] Oh. nasty!

486
00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.379
I think it's recent.

487
00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:17.714
last night's storm maybe.

488
00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:20.216
No. no. no. no. no.
You do not wanna go in there.

489
00:29:22.677 --> 00:29:25.221
Yeah. we should call the cops
or tell the ranger.

490
00:29:25.305 --> 00:29:27.724
I mean. maybe no one even knows
this is out here.

491
00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:37.317
Normally. that's what
the transponder's for.

492
00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:39.486
[switch clicking]

493
00:29:39.569 --> 00:29:41.404
No. No power.

494
00:29:42.489 --> 00:29:43.490
Shit.

495
00:29:45.366 --> 00:29:47.786
-[phone camera chimes]
-Em. what are you doing?

496
00:29:47.869 --> 00:29:49.496
Just in case someone asks.

497
00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:51.206
It's morbid. He's dead.

498
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:52.624
[Em] Okay. geez.

499
00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:55.293
Vince. man.
maybe you should get out of there.

500
00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:57.462
I don't think we oughta
be touching any of this.

501
00:29:58.129 --> 00:29:59.297
[Vince] Fuck you.

502
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.966
[Jesse] I'm serious. man.
We gotta go tell the ranger.

503
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.802
Yeah. this doesn't feel right.

504
00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:05.303
[Em] You think there's a reward?

505
00:30:07.013 --> 00:30:07.889
[gasps]

506
00:30:11.392 --> 00:30:12.644
Motherfucker.

507
00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:20.610
[Em] Is that… cocaine?

508
00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:23.947
Only one way to know for sure.

509
00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:26.324
[Alex] What are you doing?

510
00:30:26.407 --> 00:30:27.826
-You can't do that.
-Why not?

511
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:30.829
So many fucking reasons that should be
obvious to a normal human being.

512
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:34.123
Let's all just relax. okay? Alex is right.

513
00:30:34.207 --> 00:30:35.416
We can't touch this.

514
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.419
Do you have any idea how much
one of these bricks are worth?

515
00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:40.213
Enough to put each of us
away for a decade.

516
00:30:40.296 --> 00:30:42.298
-[Vince] Do you see cops?
-We're not drug dealers.

517
00:30:42.382 --> 00:30:45.677
And what about the dead body?
I mean. that's a human being.

518
00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:48.096
We'll make an anonymous call later.

519
00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:49.222
Check it! This…

520
00:30:49.305 --> 00:30:51.808
This could set us up
for a real fucking long time.

521
00:30:51.891 --> 00:30:53.601
It could literally change our lives.

522
00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:56.020
Em. you're not actually considering this?

523
00:30:57.063 --> 00:30:59.566
Not all of us are going away
to some fancy school.

524
00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:04.404
School?

525
00:31:04.487 --> 00:31:07.031
-What's she talking about?
-[Vince] She didn't tell you?

526
00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:12.245
She's leaving you. dude.
for some rich-ass college.

527
00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:15.039
Is this for real?

528
00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:17.041
No.

529
00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:19.335
I mean. it's not for sure.

530
00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:22.547
'Cause that's why I didn't tell you.
Without the scholarship…

531
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:23.923
[laughs] You can afford it now.

532
00:31:24.007 --> 00:31:25.508
-[Em] If we were to do this--
-Em!

533
00:31:25.925 --> 00:31:27.302
Was I talking to you?

534
00:31:27.927 --> 00:31:28.845
How do we sell it?

535
00:31:30.513 --> 00:31:33.391
Uh. Jesse's got a weed guy.
for sure there's a connection there.

536
00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:35.977
-No. leave me outta this.
-[Vince] You work at a casino.

537
00:31:38.813 --> 00:31:40.732
And then there's always Alex's daddy.

538
00:31:40.815 --> 00:31:42.066
Oh. do you want me to text him?

539
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.193
Or take a sample home
for Sunday night dinner?

540
00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:46.029
You're all crazy! I'm going to the cops.

541
00:31:46.112 --> 00:31:48.698
If you do. I'll tell them
he was the one who put us up to it.

542
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:49.741
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

543
00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:51.117
What happens when he finds out?

544
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.702
Hey. man. back off. okay?

545
00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:54.787
-Just give me--
-I said back the fuck up!

546
00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:57.081
I'm taking mine!

547
00:31:57.165 --> 00:31:59.584
If you call the cops.
I'll tell 'em about her daddy.

548
00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:02.921
so they'll have to investigate
and puts her family under the microscope.

549
00:32:03.004 --> 00:32:05.715
-You're a fucking asshole!
-So you keep telling me!

550
00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:08.092
Em. take her backpack.

551
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:11.429
We get outta here.

552
00:32:11.512 --> 00:32:13.806
we go our separate ways.
You forget you know us.

553
00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:17.518
No problem there.

554
00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:54.305
[Vince] Go on.

555
00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:57.308
-Ninety-nine.
-[Em laughs]

556
00:32:57.392 --> 00:32:58.226
[Vince] A hundred.

557
00:32:58.309 --> 00:33:00.603
[Em] A hundred and one. No? Okay.

558
00:33:02.855 --> 00:33:04.148
[Vince grunts and laughs]

559
00:33:15.576 --> 00:33:17.161
[Vince] Hey. baldy.

560
00:33:18.204 --> 00:33:19.247
That's our car.

561
00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:25.962
[Cutter] You kids are out pretty far.

562
00:33:27.422 --> 00:33:31.175
No one else around for… miles.

563
00:33:33.886 --> 00:33:35.096
We were hiking.

564
00:33:38.182 --> 00:33:40.184
Swimming. too. by the looks of it.

565
00:33:41.185 --> 00:33:42.061
Tell me.

566
00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:47.275

567
00:33:51.237 --> 00:33:52.155
A waterfall.

568
00:33:52.238 --> 00:33:55.033
[gasps mockingly] Beautiful. Mm.

569
00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:57.368

570
00:33:57.785 --> 00:33:59.996
-Yeah.
-[Cutter] Nothing else?

571
00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:02.081
More trees?

572
00:34:03.124 --> 00:34:07.045
Look. buddy. we're on our way back
to the ranger station. so. uh.

573
00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:08.629

574
00:34:13.676 --> 00:34:15.219
[Cutter sighs]

575
00:34:22.935 --> 00:34:24.187
[engine starts]

576
00:34:24.937 --> 00:34:26.147
[sighs]

577
00:34:30.318 --> 00:34:32.111
[Vince] Fucking keep your mouth shut.

578
00:34:32.195 --> 00:34:34.322
-[taps on window]
-[Cutter] Get the fuck out.

579
00:34:40.495 --> 00:34:41.454
[Jesse] Come on.

580
00:34:41.537 --> 00:34:44.332
We know we're in a restricted area.
we're sorry.

581
00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:46.417
-If there's a fine--
-Shut the fuck up.

582
00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:48.920
[sighs deeply]

583
00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:56.928
Jerry. You wanna come in?

584
00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:00.181
[Jerry over radio]
What's up. Cutter? Where you at?

585
00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:02.517
I'm up on that logging road.

586
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.768
North of the pass.

587
00:35:04.227 --> 00:35:06.312
Found a couple of kids.

588
00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:09.565
Say they've been hiking near Migizi Falls.

589
00:35:10.149 --> 00:35:13.402
[Jerry] Yeah. I been searching
up and down that river like twice.

590
00:35:13.986 --> 00:35:15.947
Well. maybe you missed something. Jerry.

591
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:19.575
because these kids
know more than they're saying.

592
00:35:21.035 --> 00:35:23.162
[Jerry] Yeah. all right.
I'll be there in ten.

593
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.081
Copy that.

594
00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.416
[clears throat]

595
00:35:29.919 --> 00:35:31.003
What's in the pack?

596
00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:33.881
-Camping gear.
-Uh-oh.

597
00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:36.425
You said you were hiking.

598
00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:39.178
Hiking and camping.

599
00:35:39.262 --> 00:35:40.930
Look. we don't want any trouble.

600
00:35:41.013 --> 00:35:42.431
Honest. we were just hiking and--

601
00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:45.518
How 'bout you cut the shit. thank you.

602
00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:47.979
and you open the fucking bag.

603
00:35:48.062 --> 00:35:49.105
How 'bout that?

604
00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:00.324
What's the matter. sugar?

605
00:36:02.618 --> 00:36:03.536
You scared?

606
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.623
What are you scared of?

607
00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:10.168
Come here.

608
00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:11.377
Leave her alone.

609
00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:17.049
You weren't here to hike. were you?

610
00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:20.303
Get the fuck away from her.

611
00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:23.556
-[gun clicks]
-Vince. what are you doing?

612
00:36:27.768 --> 00:36:29.270
Kid. I gotta hand it to you.

613
00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:34.150
I've had a lot of guns pointed at me
in my life. but… [clicks tongue]

614
00:36:34.233 --> 00:36:35.318
…never a flare gun.

615
00:36:35.902 --> 00:36:36.986
Congrats.

616
00:36:37.612 --> 00:36:40.198
How about you put that fucking
thing down before someone--

617
00:36:40.281 --> 00:36:41.908
[both guns fire]

618
00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:53.669
[Jesse grunts]

619
00:36:54.503 --> 00:36:56.714
-You have to hit him again.
-[Jesse grunts]

620
00:36:58.007 --> 00:36:59.926
We gotta go. Now!

621
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:01.969
Em. come on.

622
00:37:03.512 --> 00:37:06.057
We can't help him now. Get in. Go!

623
00:37:12.438 --> 00:37:14.398
I just smashed a man's skull with a rock.

624
00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:15.942
[Alex] Jesse. you saved us. okay?

625
00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:32.500
[Em] Do you know where we're going?

626
00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:33.918
[Alex] The road we came from.

627
00:37:34.001 --> 00:37:35.836
[Jesse] Is anybody even listening to me?

628
00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.256
-I just smashed a man's skull.
-You saved us.

629
00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:40.258
We have to go back.
What if Vince is just hurt?

630
00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:41.634
[Alex] We saw him get shot.

631
00:37:41.717 --> 00:37:43.052
-He's dead.
-Alex. slow down.

632
00:37:43.135 --> 00:37:44.971
-[Em] Don't say that!
-[Jesse] Slow down.

634
00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:47.932

635
00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:56.232
[Jesse screaming]

638
00:38:17.378 --> 00:38:19.755
Em? Em? Emily!

639
00:38:20.548 --> 00:38:21.590
I'm fine.

640
00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:25.344
-Hang on.
-[Jesse breathing heavily]

641
00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:47.491
[coughing]

642
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:54.915
[Alex] Okay. Easy.

643
00:38:57.209 --> 00:38:59.337
Okay. show me your leg. Can you move it?

644
00:39:00.087 --> 00:39:01.881
It's okay. Just breathe.

645
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.466
[Jesse] Is it bad?

646
00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:05.051
Looks fucking bad.

647
00:39:05.134 --> 00:39:08.054
No. you're gonna be okay. Just stay there.

648
00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:13.517
[tearing fabric]

649
00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:17.396
Hold still.

650
00:39:19.732 --> 00:39:21.609
Okay. Gonna hurt a little bit.

651
00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:23.569
-[groans]
-[Alex] Sorry.

652
00:39:26.113 --> 00:39:28.574
-[Em coughing]
-Em. are you okay?

653
00:39:28.949 --> 00:39:30.409
Do I look fucking okay?

654
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.952
Look at me.

655
00:39:33.662 --> 00:39:34.622
[Alex] Okay.

656
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.210
How's the car?

657
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.385
[Alex] Um…

658
00:39:47.927 --> 00:39:48.886
Hold on.

659
00:39:55.184 --> 00:39:57.228
[static buzzing over radio]

660
00:40:04.777 --> 00:40:07.780
[Cutter over radio]
Jerry? Jerry. wanna call back?

661
00:40:08.823 --> 00:40:10.074
Jerry?

662
00:40:10.157 --> 00:40:11.242
Murph?

663
00:40:11.992 --> 00:40:13.911
Fuck. Someone fucking answer.

664
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:22.128
[Murph over radio]
Cutter. it's Murph. I heard gunshots.

665
00:40:22.628 --> 00:40:26.382
[Cutter] One of those little fuckers
took a pop at me and fucked off.

666
00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:29.802
They know where the plane is.
I found a couple bricks.

667
00:40:32.304 --> 00:40:33.848
Anything from Jerry?

668
00:40:34.723 --> 00:40:36.267
[Murph] Nothing.

669
00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:40.479
[Cutter] He should've cut them off at
the bottom of the logging road by now.

670
00:40:41.063 --> 00:40:44.608
[Murph] I'm still at the clearing.
You want I should go check it out?

671
00:40:44.692 --> 00:40:47.570
[Cutter] No. I'll head down
and see what's going on

672
00:40:47.653 --> 00:40:49.447
as soon as I can see straight.

673
00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:52.908
Guys. we have to go on foot.
Can you stand?

674
00:40:53.534 --> 00:40:55.661
-What about the pick-up?
-[Alex] It's trashed.

675
00:40:55.744 --> 00:40:57.455
Can't you fix it? Isn't that what you do?

676
00:40:57.538 --> 00:40:58.956
There's no time! Didn't you hear?

677
00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:00.249
[Jesse] Wait. The radio.

678
00:41:00.332 --> 00:41:03.085
Maybe I can get
a emergency channel or something.

679
00:41:07.006 --> 00:41:08.966
Mayday. Mayday. Anyone there?

680
00:41:11.343 --> 00:41:13.846
-Mayday. Mayday.
-Jesse. we need to get off the main road.

681
00:41:13.929 --> 00:41:15.806
And go where?
We're in the middle of nowhere.

682
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.225
We can't stay here
and wait for that maniac to show up.

683
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:20.686
Alex is right. We gotta keep moving.

684
00:41:22.521 --> 00:41:23.564
Okay.

685
00:41:23.647 --> 00:41:25.316
[Alex grunts] Okay.

686
00:41:32.615 --> 00:41:34.825
[birds chirping]

687
00:41:37.703 --> 00:41:39.205
[Jesse groans]

688
00:41:39.288 --> 00:41:41.665
We gotta keep going. Come on.

689
00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:45.336
[Jesse groans] I can't. please.

690
00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:46.670
[Alex] Okay. okay.

691
00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:48.547
Sorry.

692
00:41:49.089 --> 00:41:51.425
Okay. my leg's numb. I think it's broken.

693
00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.636
Let's not worry
about that right now. okay?

694
00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:56.305
[breathing heavily]

695
00:41:56.388 --> 00:41:57.348
How bad?

696
00:41:58.098 --> 00:41:59.099
[Alex] It's… it's bad.

697
00:42:11.612 --> 00:42:12.988
All right. Keep still.

698
00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:17.535
[whimpers]

699
00:42:18.285 --> 00:42:20.329
All right. That should help. okay?

700
00:42:20.412 --> 00:42:22.748
-We gotta go.
-[stammers] I just need a second.

701
00:42:22.831 --> 00:42:25.709
-We're never gonna make it out.
-We'll make it.

702
00:42:25.793 --> 00:42:27.670
Em's right.
You guys should go on without me.

703
00:42:27.753 --> 00:42:30.506
-We're not leaving you.
-You mean like we left Vince?

704
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:33.300
-That was way different. okay?
-[Jesse] It doesn't matter!

705
00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:36.053
You guys need to find the ranger
and bring him back here.

706
00:42:36.136 --> 00:42:37.846
We don't even know where here is.

707
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.515
Vince was the one fucking driving!

708
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:43.143
The map! The map! Where's the map?

709
00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:44.687
Vince had it in his backpack.

710
00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:50.025
I ditched the bags when we ran.
They're still back there.

711
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:51.151
Ah. shit!

712
00:42:52.278 --> 00:42:53.487
It's not far. okay?

713
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:55.531
I can run and be back in like 20 minutes.

714
00:42:55.614 --> 00:42:57.658
Okay. Okay. go. Em and I will wait here.

715
00:42:57.741 --> 00:43:00.744
Just whistle or something
in case you don't see us.

716
00:43:01.537 --> 00:43:03.289
No. no. no! Just go!

717
00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:23.642
[softly] Vince?

718
00:43:25.894 --> 00:43:26.937
Vince.

719
00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:30.441
Vince.

720
00:44:01.263 --> 00:44:02.514
[phone line ringing]

721
00:44:02.598 --> 00:44:04.391
[operator] Police. fire or ambulance?

722
00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:06.894
Police. Hi. Yeah. I need help.
I'm in Garden Valley.

723
00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:08.228
[phone line beeps]

724
00:44:09.229 --> 00:44:10.064
Fuck.

725
00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:29.083
Hello?

726
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:30.626
Hello?

727
00:44:36.882 --> 00:44:37.883
Ah!

728
00:44:41.929 --> 00:44:44.056
Climb down. or I start taking shots.

729
00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:48.102
I got more ammo than time.
It's your choice.

730
00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:52.606
Fine. Have it your way.

731
00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:54.233
No. um. all right.

732
00:44:54.817 --> 00:44:58.070
Don't shoot. I'm coming down. okay?

733
00:44:58.153 --> 00:44:59.363
Smart girl.

734
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:05.828
We were just hiking. I swear.

735
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:08.288
Bullshit. we know you know
where the plane is.

736
00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.082
Yes. but we found it by accident.

737
00:45:10.165 --> 00:45:12.084
We really only came to hike the falls.

738
00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:15.129
All right.

739
00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:16.422
That's better.

740
00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:19.383
Now. uh. which one are you?

741
00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:22.845
-Your name?
-Alex.

742
00:45:23.429 --> 00:45:24.721
Okay. Alex.

743
00:45:25.347 --> 00:45:28.600
You're gonna take me to that plane.
and in return.

744
00:45:28.684 --> 00:45:30.394
I'm gonna let you live. You understand?

745
00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:33.564
I need you to say it out loud.

746
00:45:33.647 --> 00:45:36.900
I'll take you to the crash site.
Just. please don't hurt me.

747
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:39.069
That's up to you.

748
00:45:39.153 --> 00:45:40.028
How far is it?

749
00:45:41.613 --> 00:45:43.115
Uh. it's close.

750
00:45:44.992 --> 00:45:45.909
All right.

751
00:45:46.702 --> 00:45:47.786
Start walking.

752
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.675
[Cutter over radio]
Murph. they killed Jerry.

753
00:46:01.758 --> 00:46:04.470
-Looks like they ran off the road.
-Jesus.

754
00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:06.638
All right. I'm here with one of the girls.

755
00:46:06.722 --> 00:46:09.224
-She's taking me to the plane now.
-[Cutter] Good.

756
00:46:09.308 --> 00:46:11.351
Radio me your location
as soon as you're there.

757
00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:14.605
and no loose ends. you hear me?

758
00:46:17.149 --> 00:46:19.776
Cutter. they're just kids. you know?

759
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.946
[Cutter] Well. they saw our faces
so they don't leave this forest.

760
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.364
Is that clear?

761
00:46:25.824 --> 00:46:26.742
Murph?

762
00:46:26.825 --> 00:46:28.827
Yeah. Copy that. Murph out.

763
00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:30.496
Move.

764
00:46:52.893 --> 00:46:54.353
I don't see a plane.

765
00:46:55.354 --> 00:46:57.648
Hey! Better not be fucking around here.

766
00:46:57.731 --> 00:46:59.733
Down there. It's around a sandbank.

767
00:47:09.701 --> 00:47:11.203
I think you're lying!

768
00:47:13.622 --> 00:47:15.958
I swear. That's how we found it.
I don't know another way.

769
00:47:16.792 --> 00:47:18.544
Well. how do you get down?

770
00:47:19.836 --> 00:47:20.712
Is there a path?

771
00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:38.897
What the fuck!

772
00:47:56.456 --> 00:47:59.876
Cutter. that crazy bitch
just jumped the falls.

773
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.211
[Cutter] Are you at the plane?

774
00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:03.922
No. no. no. she was gonna
take me to the plane.

775
00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:06.383
and then she jumped the fucking falls!

776
00:48:06.466 --> 00:48:08.760
[Cutter] How 'bout you get
the fuck after her?

777
00:48:08.844 --> 00:48:10.095
Get after her.

778
00:48:10.512 --> 00:48:11.722
Get after her.

779
00:48:12.431 --> 00:48:13.432
Okay.

780
00:48:19.813 --> 00:48:21.231
Fuck that! Hell no!

781
00:48:37.956 --> 00:48:40.250
[gasps. coughs]

782
00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:52.346
[coughing]

783
00:49:29.841 --> 00:49:30.676
[coughing]

784
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.471
[Murph] Hey!

785
00:49:35.222 --> 00:49:37.099
Hey! You trying to get yourself killed?

786
00:49:37.724 --> 00:49:38.809
You gonna shoot me?

787
00:49:39.685 --> 00:49:41.144
I don't see a plane!

788
00:49:45.148 --> 00:49:46.024
Do it!

789
00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:48.402
[gun cocks]

790
00:49:58.954 --> 00:49:59.871
Fuck!

791
00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:11.133
[exhales sharply]

792
00:50:14.761 --> 00:50:15.637
Cutter.

793
00:50:17.055 --> 00:50:19.391
The current's too strong.
She must have drowned.

794
00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:22.185
What about the plane?

795
00:50:22.269 --> 00:50:24.146
[Murph] Still no sign of it.

796
00:50:25.897 --> 00:50:29.109
Well. I've got the other two. so…

797
00:50:30.569 --> 00:50:32.195
we'll know soon enough.

798
00:50:32.654 --> 00:50:33.739
Copy that.

799
00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:37.659
They aren't going…

800
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:40.412
anywhere.

801
00:50:42.038 --> 00:50:44.332
[groaning in pain]

802
00:50:51.131 --> 00:50:53.008
[humming]

803
00:51:05.103 --> 00:51:06.480
Need a little haircut?

804
00:51:06.855 --> 00:51:07.731
Just one or two?

805
00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:12.944
What about you. huh?

806
00:51:13.028 --> 00:51:14.279
Just a hair or two.

807
00:51:16.364 --> 00:51:17.282
Maybe.

808
00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:19.659
[Cutter chuckles]

809
00:51:22.871 --> 00:51:24.122
[Cutter humming]

810
00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:52.776
[screams]

811
00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:03.245
[panting]

812
00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:37.487
[leaves rustling]

813
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:46.663
-You're alive.
-Yeah.

814
00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:48.957
No thanks to any of you.

815
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.042
But we looked for you.

816
00:52:51.626 --> 00:52:53.503
Hmm. I bet you looked real fucking hard.

817
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.130
Where's Em And Jesse?

818
00:52:55.213 --> 00:52:57.173
Jesse hit that asshole with a rock.

819
00:52:57.257 --> 00:52:59.551
which only pissed him off. so we took off.

820
00:52:59.926 --> 00:53:02.095
[scoffs] Got real far I see.

821
00:53:02.178 --> 00:53:05.682
Jesse and Em are hiding down the road.
but I went back to get the map

822
00:53:05.765 --> 00:53:07.225
and I ran into another one of them.

823
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:10.186
Oh. the map's gone.
along with everything else.

824
00:53:11.104 --> 00:53:12.147
How'd you get away?

825
00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:13.773
I jumped the falls.

826
00:53:15.567 --> 00:53:16.484
Like for real?

827
00:53:17.277 --> 00:53:20.196
-Like. like from the top top?
-Yeah.

828
00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.157
[laughs]

829
00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.992
You're fucking crazy.

830
00:53:24.075 --> 00:53:25.577
Oh. Ow. Fuck.

831
00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.122
Look. they're probably looking for me. so…

832
00:53:32.834 --> 00:53:35.837
Oh. You know. a please
or a thank you would be nice.

833
00:53:35.921 --> 00:53:38.673
-You're such a dick.
-Love you. too.

834
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.635
[Vince groans softly]

835
00:53:59.819 --> 00:54:00.654
Jesus!

836
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.074
A little warning next time.

837
00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:06.826
Next dead body. promise.

838
00:54:08.119 --> 00:54:09.245
[Vince] Who are you?

839
00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:14.542
That should hold.

840
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:21.091
What are you doing? Give me the keys.

841
00:54:21.174 --> 00:54:22.968
[scoffs] Dream on. gimp.

842
00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:32.978
[engine starts]

843
00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:40.568
[birds chirping]

844
00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:52.372
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

845
00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:54.332
What the fuck did you
think was gonna happen?

846
00:54:54.416 --> 00:54:56.459
I saw an opportunity and I took it.

847
00:54:56.543 --> 00:54:58.086
An opportunity for free drugs?

848
00:54:58.169 --> 00:54:59.504
World doesn't work like that.

849
00:54:59.587 --> 00:55:01.381
Yeah. well. my world
doesn't work your way.

850
00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:03.258
At least you have options. Me. I'm…

851
00:55:04.217 --> 00:55:06.219
I'm another fucking
Danny Hagel waiting to happen.

852
00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:07.595
That's not true.

853
00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:11.349
-You really need to talk to Em.
-About what?

854
00:55:11.433 --> 00:55:13.226
Whoa. Look.

855
00:55:18.189 --> 00:55:19.607
Oh. fuck.

856
00:55:19.691 --> 00:55:20.567
Yes!

857
00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:23.153
[indistinct radio chatter]

858
00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:27.574
Thank God you're here.
There are these guys.

859
00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:30.452
They have guns. They're after us.
They're drug runners or something.

860
00:55:30.535 --> 00:55:32.203
Whoa. slow down. Slowly.

861
00:55:32.287 --> 00:55:33.580
We heard the gunshots.

862
00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:35.582
We've already got patrols in the area.

863
00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:36.833
You're safe.

864
00:55:36.916 --> 00:55:38.084
What about Em and Jesse?

865
00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:39.210
Yeah. they're our friends.

866
00:55:39.294 --> 00:55:41.004
Emily and Jesse. Yeah. we know.

867
00:55:41.087 --> 00:55:42.756
We picked them up a while back.

868
00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:44.716
Yeah. we got them at the ranger station.

869
00:55:44.799 --> 00:55:46.342
They're getting all patched up.

870
00:55:47.218 --> 00:55:48.845
Come on. I'll take you to them.

871
00:55:48.928 --> 00:55:50.555
I think you need a call for back up.

872
00:55:50.638 --> 00:55:51.890
'cause these guys are killers.

873
00:55:51.973 --> 00:55:53.933
We saw three of them.
but there could be more.

874
00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.560
Oh. okay.

875
00:55:55.643 --> 00:55:56.644
Hold on.

876
00:55:58.313 --> 00:56:00.315
Yeah. I got the other two.

877
00:56:00.398 --> 00:56:03.526
I'll contact you from
the ranger station. Over.

878
00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.361
Copy that. Over.

879
00:56:09.449 --> 00:56:11.826
You think you'd be able to…

880
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:13.661
describe these guys if you saw 'em?

881
00:56:13.745 --> 00:56:14.662
Absolutely.

882
00:56:14.746 --> 00:56:16.456
-One guy had some. uh--
-[gun cocks]

883
00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:20.710
[Alex grunts]

884
00:56:54.828 --> 00:56:55.829
[Skip sighs]

885
00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.291
-Come on. rise and shine.
-[groans softly]

886
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.461
There she is.

887
00:57:08.091 --> 00:57:09.134
You ready to talk?

888
00:57:10.176 --> 00:57:11.219
Where am I?

889
00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:16.141
[Skip] You're alive.

890
00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:21.271
Whether you stay that way is up to you.

891
00:57:21.729 --> 00:57:22.939
My friends?

892
00:57:23.648 --> 00:57:24.732
Where are my friends?

893
00:57:28.862 --> 00:57:32.657
Cutter. missy here wants proof of life.

894
00:57:33.241 --> 00:57:34.534
[Cutter over radio] Copy that.

895
00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:36.369
-[Jesse groans]
-Stop.

896
00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:38.496
-[Jesse and Em screaming]
-Stop.

897
00:57:39.414 --> 00:57:40.582
Stop!

898
00:57:40.665 --> 00:57:42.083
Where's my plane. Alex?

899
00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.175
Fine.

900
00:57:51.384 --> 00:57:53.178
-I'll tell you.
-No. you'll take me.

901
00:57:54.262 --> 00:57:56.514
And this time. we'll stay on dry land.

902
00:57:57.765 --> 00:57:59.017
[motorcycle approaching]

903
00:58:04.522 --> 00:58:08.026
You make one sound.

904
00:58:08.109 --> 00:58:11.029
I'll take one life.

905
00:58:13.114 --> 00:58:14.407
We clear?

906
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.035
Crystal.

907
00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:40.058
[man speaking indistinctly over radio]

908
00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:48.441
[man over radio] We're looking at
a lot of mudslides up there.

909
00:58:48.525 --> 00:58:49.943
If you're coming up from the north.

910
00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:52.403
I'd say you're looking
at a lot of detours.

911
00:58:52.487 --> 00:58:54.614
And it's best to stay clear.

912
00:58:56.241 --> 00:58:57.492
[gun cocks]

913
00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:10.880
[Skip] Hi there.

914
00:59:12.131 --> 00:59:14.509
If you're looking for a day pass.
you're outta luck.

915
00:59:14.592 --> 00:59:18.304
Park's closed for maintenance
on account of last night's storm.

916
00:59:19.097 --> 00:59:20.723
I'm not here to sightsee.

917
00:59:21.432 --> 00:59:23.685
[Skip] Well. then.
what can I help you with?

918
00:59:27.313 --> 00:59:28.606
I'm looking for Skip.

919
00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:30.525
Hmm. [sucks teeth]

920
00:59:30.608 --> 00:59:32.151
Don't know no Skip.

921
00:59:32.652 --> 00:59:34.195
Something I can help you with?

922
00:59:37.448 --> 00:59:38.700
Sir?

923
00:59:42.453 --> 00:59:45.331
I was told I'd find Skip
at the ranger station.

924
00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:47.750
Well. like I said.

925
00:59:47.834 --> 00:59:51.212
nobody's been by all day
on account of last night's storm.

926
00:59:51.296 --> 00:59:53.089
Trails are pretty washed out.

927
00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:58.886
-Is that right?
-[Skip] Afraid so.

928
01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:05.226
But if your friend Skip shows up.

929
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.312
I'd be happy to give her a message.

930
01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.109
I never said Skip was a her.

931
01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:17.739
-Lucky guess.
-Yeah.

932
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:19.991
Hands on the counter. now.

933
01:00:20.074 --> 01:00:22.243
Okay. we don't keep any money here.

934
01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.870
Shut the hell up.

935
01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.792
[clattering]

936
01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:33.171
[gunshot]

937
01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:35.673
You bitch. [groans]

938
01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:43.723
[gunshot]

939
01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.812
That's on you.

940
01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:54.400
Nolan. come in.

941
01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:58.321
[Nolan over radio]
Been waiting on you. What's the hold up?

942
01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:00.865
Bit of a complication.

943
01:01:01.949 --> 01:01:03.951
You stay put. I'm coming to you.

944
01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.420
You had to be a rebel. huh?

945
01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:19.467
We're going for a ride.

946
01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:37.985
[Skip grunts frustratedly]

947
01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.781
Keep moving.

948
01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:43.408
You're so fucked.

949
01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:44.492
Oh. is that so?

950
01:01:44.575 --> 01:01:46.411
When my dad finds out
what you guys are doing.

951
01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:48.788
he's gonna cut you up
into tiny little pieces.

952
01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:51.749
Mm. that's precious.
Your daddy can't save you now.

953
01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:53.418
You just killed a Saint.

954
01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.962
Now you've one of their kids hostage.

955
01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.589
I'm talking to a dead woman.

956
01:01:58.673 --> 01:01:59.549
[Skip scoffs]

957
01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:01.968
Nice bluff. kid.

958
01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.430
I'll take my chances.

959
01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.056
Get in.

960
01:02:08.641 --> 01:02:09.684
Get in!

961
01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.776
[Skip over radio] Nolan. come in.

962
01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:21.320
Change of plans.

963
01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.822
A Saint showed up.

964
01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.408
Had to do what I had to do.

965
01:02:25.491 --> 01:02:28.619
-[Nolan] Jesus Christ.
-Couldn't be helped.

966
01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:31.038
-[Nolan] You had to?
-Now. this changes things.

967
01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.499
I'd say that's a major
fucking understatement.

968
01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.418
[Skip] We can still get ahead of this.

969
01:02:35.501 --> 01:02:37.920
Gotta move fast before more show up.

970
01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:39.839
I'm on my way to the plane now.

971
01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:42.508
I'll radio a location when I'm there.

972
01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.010
And what about the kids?

973
01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:46.053
You know. just keep them breathing.

974
01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:49.474
After that. you can give them to Cutter.

975
01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:53.936
Man. this is fucked up.

976
01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:05.865
[Skip breathes deeply]

977
01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:08.117
There's a way you can
still get out of this.

978
01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.703
You take me to that plane.

979
01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:13.122
I'll let you go.

980
01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:15.124
Simple as that.

981
01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:19.879
Maybe I'll even let
your little boyfriend keep his leg.

982
01:03:23.674 --> 01:03:24.842
Hey!

983
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.057
This can hurt… just as well as kill.

984
01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.268
Do you understand me?

985
01:03:37.396 --> 01:03:38.397
Good.

986
01:03:40.858 --> 01:03:42.193
Now. where are we headed?

987
01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:44.278
Just around the bend.

988
01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:46.989
See how easy that was?

989
01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:48.491
[engine starts]

990
01:03:55.581 --> 01:03:56.415
[Alex grunts]

991
01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:58.209
[Skip] Shit!

992
01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.711
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

993
01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:09.887
[Alex screams]

994
01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:11.556

-[gunshot]
-[Alex grunts]

996
01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:19.313
[Skip] Big mistake!

997
01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:24.318
I'm gonna make it real slow
and painful for your friends.

998
01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:28.781
First. I'll do missy.

999
01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:32.493
And then I'll set your boyfriend on fire.

1000
01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:34.871
just a little bit at a time…

1001
01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:41.002
until the forest fills with
the smell of burning flesh.

1002
01:04:49.927 --> 01:04:51.971
Tune in if you don't believe me.

1003
01:04:57.810 --> 01:04:59.145
It's up to you.

1004
01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:02.732
[breathes deeply]

1005
01:05:07.695 --> 01:05:12.158
Cutter. don't lay a finger on those brats
'til you hear from me. are you clear?

1006
01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.704
Wouldn't dream of it.

1007
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.419
-Leave him alone!
-[Cutter] What's the matter with you?

1008
01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:26.505
[gasps] You feeling left out. huh?

1009
01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.591
-I'm pregnant!
-[Murph] Hey!

1010
01:05:29.383 --> 01:05:30.885
You heard what Skip said.

1011
01:05:32.553 --> 01:05:33.763
They're just kids.

1012
01:05:33.846 --> 01:05:35.389
[Cutter gasps] Yeah.

1013
01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:38.893
You're right. Little kiddies. huh?

1014
01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:44.899
This one smashed my fucking head in
with a fucking rock!

1015
01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.902
Hey. Hey.

1016
01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:52.198
You take orders from me.

1017
01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:54.075
not the other way around.

1018
01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.412
You understand?

1019
01:05:58.746 --> 01:05:59.872
You get that?

1020
01:06:00.539 --> 01:06:02.541
Yeah. I gotcha.

1021
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:06.545
Good.

1022
01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.717
Hey. guys.

1023
01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:15.054
I'm feeling generous today.

1024
01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:17.473
So. tell you what.

1025
01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:21.519
-I'm gonna let one of you…
-[gun cocks]

1026
01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:22.603
…go free.

1027
01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.523
And the best part is.

1028
01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:28.109
you get to decide…

1029
01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.736
who it is.

1030
01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:35.408
Or I can decide for you.

1031
01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:38.619
What do you say?

1032
01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:47.545
Who's it gonna be?

1033
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.674
[chuckles]

1034
01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:54.885
Who's it gonna be?

1035
01:06:55.886 --> 01:06:57.930
[breathes deeply]

1036
01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:08.357
[Jesse] What are you doing?

1037
01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:10.860
[Cutter feigns shock]

1038
01:07:11.652 --> 01:07:12.820
Uh oh.

1039
01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:15.239
Cock it.

1040
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:19.452
Em. he's lying. He's not gonna let you go.

1041
01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:21.162
-[gun cocks]
-I'm sorry.

1042
01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:22.997
No.

1043
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.206
-[Em] I'm sorry.
-No.

1044
01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:29.462
Oh.

1045
01:07:29.962 --> 01:07:31.088
Please. Please. don't!

1046
01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:34.508
[gun clicks]

1047
01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:36.218
[gasps] Oh.

1048
01:07:40.639 --> 01:07:43.017
At least we know
which one of you has balls.

1049
01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.519
[breathing heavily]

1050
01:07:47.521 --> 01:07:50.066
[Cutter] How about another round. huh?

1051
01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:52.902
I don't know about you.
but I could do this all day.

1052
01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:55.321
Here. Take it again.

1053
01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:58.115
Quit fucking around. Cutter.

1054
01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:01.452
If the little bitch doesn't show up.

1055
01:08:01.535 --> 01:08:03.079
we're gonna need one of these two.

1056
01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:06.040
We're losing daylight here.

1057
01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:08.125
I'm just saying.

1058
01:08:08.667 --> 01:08:10.211
Yeah. well. this isn't over.

1059
01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:14.548
And I'm not leaving empty handed.

1060
01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:01.595

1234
01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:44.793
You should probably stay off of that.

1235
01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.134
Good for you. kid.

1236
01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:56.763
Are you gonna finish me?

1237
01:22:57.722 --> 01:22:58.807
Think I just did.

1238
01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:08.316
Bam.

1239
01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.484
[Cutter] You fucker!

1240
01:23:10.568 --> 01:23:12.570
Oh. you fucking son of a bitch!

1241
01:23:16.616 --> 01:23:17.575
Fuck!

1242
01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.245
Let's go get Jesse and Em.

1243
01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:22.580
[Murph] Don't worry.
They can't be too far.

1244
01:23:23.581 --> 01:23:24.874
You get what I asked for?

1245
01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.462
[engine starts]

1246
01:23:55.989 --> 01:23:57.824
[Murph] Shit. Fuck.

1247
01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.255
Both of you. Out.

1248
01:24:16.509 --> 01:24:18.303
Uh-uh! No!

1249
01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:31.816
Hi. Dad.

1250
01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:34.360
Hello.

1251
01:24:37.363 --> 01:24:38.239
[chuckles]

1252
01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.076
These belong to you?

1253
01:24:44.537 --> 01:24:45.413
Let them go.

1254
01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.957
Hmm. thought we were negotiating here.

1255
01:24:50.168 --> 01:24:53.379
Your drugs and the others are waiting
for you about a quarter mile back.

1256
01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:54.631
Just follow the smoke.

1257
01:24:58.384 --> 01:24:59.719
Hmm. And him?

1258
01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:01.554
He helped me out.

1259
01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:03.723
I'm alive because of him.

1260
01:25:04.849 --> 01:25:05.767
No.

1261
01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:08.895
No. little girl.

1262
01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.315
you're alive because of me.

1263
01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:16.486
You know. I put up with a lot of shit
growing up. but I'm done.

1264
01:25:16.569 --> 01:25:18.696
-Watch it.
-[Alex] Why? You gonna hit me?

1265
01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:21.908
Like you hit mom?

1266
01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:32.836
I bet you think the whole world
is pretty black and white.

1267
01:25:32.919 --> 01:25:34.003
don't you?

1268
01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:37.507
I'm willing to guess
there's a lot more of the old man in you

1269
01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:38.758
than you're willing to admit.

1270
01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:44.556
Maybe.

1271
01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:47.225
But just in case.

1272
01:25:47.892 --> 01:25:50.186
I uploaded a shit ton
of incriminating evidence

1273
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:52.230
from Skip's phone to the Cloud.

1274
01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:55.150
Anything happens to us.
it all gets released.

1275
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.906
You can go.

1276
01:26:11.374 --> 01:26:12.667
Next time.

1277
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:14.752
get your boys to lock their phones.

1278
01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:17.380
No. no. no. Not him.

1279
01:26:17.463 --> 01:26:18.631
[Nick] That's… He was…

1280
01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:19.924
He chose this.

1281
01:26:20.383 --> 01:26:21.718
and I'm not asking.

1282
01:26:22.927 --> 01:26:24.137
[Murph] It's okay. Alex.

1283
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:26.472
He's right.

1284
01:26:32.228 --> 01:26:33.646
See you around. Nick.

1285
01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:41.446
Let's go.

1286
01:26:42.113 --> 01:26:43.114
Leave him.

1287
01:26:48.411 --> 01:26:49.913
[engines start]

1288
01:27:08.848 --> 01:27:09.974
[engine starts]

1289
01:27:28.117 --> 01:27:29.911
[motorcycles approaching]

1290
01:28:24.257 --> 01:28:25.258
[gun clicks]

1291
01:28:26.884 --> 01:28:27.969
Oh.

1292
01:28:53.953 --> 01:28:55.246
I'll be seeing ya.

1293
01:28:57.248 --> 01:28:58.291
Probably.

1294
01:29:30.114 --> 01:29:33.034
[woman] Your transcripts
are clearly impeccable.

1295
01:29:33.117 --> 01:29:35.912
It's obvious you were
diligent in your studies.

1296
01:29:35.995 --> 01:29:36.829
Thank you.

1297
01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:38.915
But we like to get to know each candidate

1298
01:29:38.998 --> 01:29:41.250
on a more personal level.

1299
01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:45.046
It helps to give us a sense of
what kind of contribution

1300
01:29:45.129 --> 01:29:48.674
we can expect from our serious students.

1301
01:29:48.758 --> 01:29:50.051
Character counts.

1302
01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:53.554
Of course.

1303
01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:58.226
So. then. could you please tell us
about a time in your life

1304
01:29:58.309 --> 01:30:02.980
that best exemplifies a moment
where you had to overcome adversity.

1305
01:30:04.023 --> 01:30:08.736
and how that experience has gone on
to shape the person that you are today?

1306
01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:12.156
[inhales deeply]
