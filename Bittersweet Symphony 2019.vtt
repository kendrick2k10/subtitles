219
00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:53.218

-he just showed up.
-I haven't seen you in ages.

Yeah. it annoys you guys.

274
00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:40.825

-Well. I didn't want to--

282
00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:53.872
I didn't want to bother you.

283
00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:54.939
I mean. you're busy over
there and she's been--

284
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.274
Yeah. but I'm not busy enough.

285
00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.909

286
00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:00.345
Yeah. nothing's changed.
I mean. she's--

287

00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:08.046
<i> So I think that's</i>
<i> a testament to your talent.</i>

312
00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:09.547
<i> -Uh--</i>
-Wow.

313
00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:11.082
<i> But she's got. uh--</i>

314
00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:13.585
<i> -she's got a huge heart. And--</i>
-Wow!

315
00:14:13.587 --> 00:14:17.555
-I-- I'm nervous.
<i> -She's got lots of experience</i>
<i> she wants to share with you.</i>

316
00:14:17.557 --> 00:14:20.425
[Iris] Yeah. she does
have a lot of experience.

317
00:14:20.427 --> 00:14:22.594
-[Griffin]<i> Yeah.</i>
-I mean. with everything.

318
00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:25.930
-[Griffin chuckles]<i> Well.</i>
<i> she's had a life.</i>
-[Iris chuckles]

319
00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:30.268
<i> This is a--</i>
<i> a genre that-- that</i>
<i> she practically invented.</i>

320
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.936
<i> the sound of romantic comedy.</i>

321
00:14:31.938 --> 00:14:34.339
<i> and she just wants</i>
<i> to sort of help.</i>

322
00:14:34.341 --> 00:14:37.675
<i> Just don't sleep with her.</i>
<i> things get really complicated</i>
<i> after that.</i>

323
00:14:37.677 --> 00:14:40.311
-What? Griff.
-[laughing]<i> Never mind.</i>

324
00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:42.347
-[lady] You never lock the door?
-Keith. give the lady
some space.

325
00:14:42.349 --> 00:14:44.949
-Hi. I'm Abby. Iris' big
sister. Yeah.
-Hi.

326
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:47.318
-Oh. my god. You're so pretty.
-[Keith] I'll close the door.
Shall I stay in

327
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.887
-or close the door? Close
the door. yeah. probably.
-[Abby] Thank you.

328
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:51.289
-Iris!
-Dad! Dad. you'll
never guess what.

329
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:54.025
Eleanor Roberts wants
to work with me!

330
00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:56.461
-Oh. hi. You're Iris?
-[Iris] Oh. my god.

331
00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:58.429
Yeah. I'm Iris.
What are you doing here?

332
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:00.398
-My god. I just--
-No. no. I just got off
the phone with Griff.

333
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.666
Did you know who I. okay.

334
00:15:01.668 --> 00:15:03.234
'cause they didn't
know who I was.

335
00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.669
-and I just felt like I--
-Oh. okay. you came.

336
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:06.471
Is this the wrong day.
is this the wrong day?

337
00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:09.407
No. he said that maybe you'd
wanna come on Thursday.

338
00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:10.708
I didn't realize
that you'd be here right now.

339
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.210
What day is today?

340
00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:15.346
-It's Tuesday. but I'm so--
-Oh. fuck!

341
00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:18.016
Today. no way--
Oh fuck. oh fuck!

342
00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:20.652
-No. just tell me. wait.
what is today?
-Tuesday.

343
00:15:20.654 --> 00:15:24.122
-Tuesday.
-Oh. fuck! You know. I jus--
Fucking whor-- I'm so sorry.

344
00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:28.192
I'm so sorry. I'm. I'm-- You
guys probably don't even swear.
I'm so sorry.

345
00:15:28.194 --> 00:15:31.062
-I'm sorry.
-[Keith] I swear a bit.
I swear a bit. like. shit. piss.

346
00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:33.965
What happened was he said
just go help this girl.

347
00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:35.466
she's in a lot
of fucking trouble.

348
00:15:35.468 --> 00:15:37.335
I mean. not that you're
in fucking trouble.

349
00:15:37.337 --> 00:15:39.404
'cause he says you're really
brilliant. you're really great.

350
00:15:39.406 --> 00:15:41.339
I can't believe
that you look like this

351
00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:43.241
and you're really that great.
but I'm sure you are.

352
00:15:43.243 --> 00:15:46.144
-She is very talented.
-Yeah. I'm sure. but guess what?

353
00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:47.712
-I think I need a drink.
-[Keith] Yes.

354
00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:49.113
-I can get you a drink.
-[Eleanor] You know why?

355
00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:50.682
-Yeah. wine?
-I'm-- I'm-- Yeah. okay.

356
00:15:50.684 --> 00:15:53.051
Actually Jack Daniels. oh.
did I decide Jack Daniels?

357
00:15:53.053 --> 00:15:55.987
-We actually-- we actually got--
-You know what?

358
00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:57.455
-Brandy. whatever you have.
-Would you like some coke?

359
00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.990
-Actually I'm freezing.
-Do you have a jacket?

360
00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:00.258
-Are you cold?
-No. you know what.

361
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.260
I'm fine. I'll just
put my jacket on.

362
00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:03.728
-That's in the summerhouse.
I've got--
-[Eleanor] Okay.

363
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.763
-Well. thank you.
-It's alright. no problem.

364
00:16:05.765 --> 00:16:07.999
Have a nice-- Ah!

365
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:09.701
-Ah. you got my nipple.
-I am so thirsty.

366
00:16:09.703 --> 00:16:11.102
-I'll bring one over.
-Alright.

367
00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:12.203
-Okay. thank you.
-Alright. guys.

368
00:16:12.205 --> 00:16:13.171
I'll see you in a bit.

369
00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:14.472
It's freezing out here.

370
00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:15.673
-I need a sweater or something.
-No. no.

371
00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:17.342
It's fine. I've got one
in there.

372
00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:19.143
Just saying. your daughter
proper twatted my nipple.

373
00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:21.245
-[Abby] Oh Keith.
-Well. I think you deserved it.

374
00:16:21.247 --> 00:16:23.147
What have I done?
I'm making her feel welcome.

375
00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.083
A kind of a licky right now.
A kind of a licky.

376
00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.452
If she doesn't mind.
what's the problem with it?

377
00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:29.787
I didn't put anything
in her. did I?

378
00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:31.422
It-- it pulls out
and there's a whole--

379
00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:33.224
-Oh. god. it's--
-Kind of throws on that.

380
00:16:33.226 --> 00:16:35.059
-Are you kidding? This is--
-You sort of like. you know.

381
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:36.694
-[laughing] Oh!
-Just like that.

382
00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:39.497
Oh. my god. you have no idea
how much you've inspired me.

383
00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.065
it's like unbelievable. like.

384
00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:43.101
<i> My Body Can't Metabolize</i>
<i> My Excitement.</i>

385
00:16:43.103 --> 00:16:45.003
like that's one of my favorite
songs and I actually--

386
00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:47.505
<i> My Body Can't Metabolize</i>
<i> the Excitement I Crave.</i> yeah.

387
00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.474
<i> My Body Can't--</i>
Sorry. it's so embarrassing.

388
00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:51.542
<i> My Body Can't Metabolize</i>
<i> the Excitement I Crave.</i>

389
00:16:51.544 --> 00:16:53.311
It actually inspired the song

390
00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:56.214
that I was thinking
for the movie called. uh.

391
00:16:56.216 --> 00:16:59.417
<i> You Could Be the Person</i>
<i> I Choose to Suffer With.</i>

392
00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:00.818
Do you wanna just
like drum it out?

393
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.420
What. now? You know what.

394
00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:03.521
-actually. I--
-Do you still.

395
00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:04.489
ever feel like that?

396
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:06.157
I don't know.

397
00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:07.759
No. I don't ever feel
like drummin' it out. no.

398
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:09.293
-It's like--
-[both screaming]

399
00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:10.561
Can I call you an icon?

400
00:17:11.765 --> 00:17:14.632
No. that's like
a thing on a computer.

401
00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:16.167
Can I call you my hero?

402
00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:20.805
Argh. Eleanor Roberts!

403
00:17:20.807 --> 00:17:22.673
Oh. my god!

404
00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:24.509
Like I just literally wanna
smash my guitar up for you.

405
00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:27.345
Okay. don't smash
your guitar. okay.

406
00:17:27.347 --> 00:17:28.312
[petanque boules clacking]

407
00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.551
[Leonard grunts]

408
00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:38.856
Oh. that was pretty good.

409
00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:47.231
-[in Australian accent]
Good day. Sheila.
-Oh my.

410
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.366
How are you today?

411
00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:50.535
-Good day. mate.
-You doing well?

412
00:17:50.537 --> 00:17:51.836
Yes. mate. how are you?

413
00:17:51.838 --> 00:17:54.672
Keeping your Parisian
theme. I see.

414
00:17:54.674 --> 00:17:56.140
-even in Wales.
-God. you're annoying.

415
00:17:56.142 --> 00:17:57.508
You can't get it
out of you. can ya?

416
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.810
No. I haven't done
this accent for years.

417
00:17:58.812 --> 00:18:00.311
Just having your tea?

418
00:18:00.313 --> 00:18:03.181
Feeling a little bit you
know. peppy this morning?

419
00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:05.083
-Weirded out by last night?
-[Iris sighs]

420
00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:07.585
I'm not like
totally weirded out.

421
00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.587
but maybe a little
bit weirded out. yeah.

422
00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:11.222
but like. it's fine. right.

423
00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:12.890
Who the hell's sleeping
in our summerhouse. mate?

424
00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:15.426
-This is my idol.
-I'm not even
gonna pretend to know

425
00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:17.829
-what you're talking about.
-Don't you remember like.

426
00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:19.430
I had her posters on my wall.

427
00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.466
composed for some
of my favorite films.

428
00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:23.401
<i>Tomorrow. Yesterday Never Comes.</i>

429
00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:24.535
-Eleanor Roberts.
-[Abby] Yeah. I've
seen<i> Tomorrow.</i>

430
00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:25.870
I maybe watched that one. yeah.

431
00:18:25.872 --> 00:18:27.738
Literally like.
she's a living legend.

432
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.607
So how long is she staying?

433
00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.409
You know mum's back
this afternoon?

434
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:33.778
I do. I do know
mum's back this afternoon.

435
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.380
Good. and by the way. I haven't
seen mum in three months.

436
00:18:36.382 --> 00:18:38.182
No. I know. you haven't
seen me in three months.

437
00:18:38.184 --> 00:18:40.418
So I don't want another
distraction.

438
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.921
<i> ¶ Three months long. you</i>
<i> Have not seen our mum ¶</i>

439
00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:47.158
Iris. you need to grow up
a little bit and address
the situation.

440
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.193
[Iris] But she says
she likes drinking wine.

441
00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:51.262
like in the middle of the night.
if she gets thirsty.

442
00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:54.465
What difficulties are you
having with your work?

443
00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:57.768
-What? Nothing.
-What difficult-- She's
obviously here to help you.

444
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.170
Let's-- What's
your boss's name again?

445
00:18:59.172 --> 00:19:00.638
We didn't eat
anything last night.

446
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.839
Oh. God. Iris.
you're always just

447
00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:04.375
skirting around the situation.

448
00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:05.676
I think you need to work out.

449
00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:07.245
maybe spend
the day with her today.

450
00:19:07.247 --> 00:19:10.181
get the work done
and then finish it and get--

451
00:19:10.183 --> 00:19:12.617
Paint me. Jack. like one
of your French ladies.

452
00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:14.952
[laughing]
Stop it. you're so weird.

453
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.524
[Iris] How do you
like to start the day?

454
00:19:19.526 --> 00:19:22.527
-I had an idea.
-Ahem. yeah?

455
00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:25.429
I don't know. I'm just
trying to get into the zone.

456
00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:26.797
'cause I think we should
start working today.

457
00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:28.366
-like pretty shortly.
-Yeah.

458
00:19:28.368 --> 00:19:29.734
-Yeah.
-That's what I'm doing.

459
00:19:29.736 --> 00:19:31.636
Can I just be honest with you?
I've been having

460
00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:34.505
this horrible writer's block.
I literally pick up the guitar

461
00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:35.840
and I don't know
what the fuck to do.

462
00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:37.742
I mean. I think I've got
some of the music down

463
00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:40.478
for the kind of instrumental
just walking around bits.

464
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.313
He wants-- He wants
a lot of like walking music.

465
00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:43.748
when they're not doing
anything or talking.

466
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.316
-all I want is to do--
-Can I just say something?

fancy life.

create in a house like that.

I mean. why don't you just
hide out in there with me.

476

-but I am quite
a nervous person.
-Are you nervous?

481
00:20:14.614 --> 00:20:16.847
It's all in you.
but you have to start.

482

come alive. you understand?

483
00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:20.885
-So uptight.
-I'm not. I'm not uptight.

484
00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.587
You're the most uptight
person I've ever met.

00:20:31.864 --> 00:20:33.664
-Just do your thing.
-This is me.

492
00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:36.634
Come on. you're cooler
than that. man. come on.

493

00:27:37.123 --> 00:27:38.455
But do you need to know me

633
00:27:38.457 --> 00:27:40.024

Oh. I don't need to know you.
I need to know.

643
00:27:56.776 --> 00:27:58.876

that lolly in my mouth.

00:31:41.567 --> 00:31:44.668
Yeah. she always had
a habit of doing that.

714
00:31:46.705 --> 00:31:48.539
So.

715
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.374
when. um.
I went to the hospital.

716
00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:55.946
um. they said
that they. they can't
rebalance things anymore.

717
00:31:55.948 --> 00:31:57.681
they've changed
my tablets around.

718
00:31:57.683 --> 00:32:00.117
they've tried different
combinations of everything

719
00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:03.553
and essentially what's happened
is that there is fluid

720
00:32:03.555 --> 00:32:05.455
that's building up
on. on the lungs.

721
00:32:05.457 --> 00:32:07.624
it's all. all going on inside.

722

00:32:10.562 --> 00:32:11.528
Okay.

00:32:13.699 --> 00:32:15.465

725
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:18.435

726
00:32:21.707 --> 00:32:23.640

really well. you know?

727
00:32:26.512 --> 00:32:28.378

728
00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.646

exciting things.

729
00:32:29.648 --> 00:32:31.114

730
00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:33.350

-Did you hear me?

731
00:32:33.352 --> 00:32:35.452
Yeah. I've got
like two more songs.

732
00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:36.720

733
00:32:36.722 --> 00:32:41.425

bits for you.

00:33:48.627 --> 00:33:51.528
She wandered into
my gallery in Paris. saw me.

742
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.730
[Abby] The most prestigious
gallery in Paris.
by the way. it is.

743
00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:55.832
And I think it's fair to say

744
00:33:55.834 --> 00:33:59.236
she fell pretty quickly for me.

745
00:33:59.238 --> 00:34:02.072
I've got half a dozen
properties in Paris alone.

746
00:34:02.074 --> 00:34:03.373

around the world really.

I would have probably been.
okay. I'm saying it wrong.

768
00:35:00.532 --> 00:35:03.733
if I'd had a mum like you.

769
00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:07.104
I wouldn't be like I am.

770
00:35:07.106 --> 00:35:09.106
in a bad way.
you know what I mean?

771
00:35:09.108 --> 00:35:10.807
-[Iris] Yeah.
-[Eleanor] Like I'd just be--

772
00:35:10.809 --> 00:35:13.710
I'd just be better. 'cause
I never-- I never had that.

773

on too long. I'm sorry.

know we were here?

795
00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:20.844
-You're welcome.
-Keith. did you invite Bobby?

796
00:36:20.846 --> 00:36:23.313
-Yep.
-Yeah. is that a problem?

797
00:36:23.315 --> 00:36:25.282
[Iris] Why'd you guys even talk?

798
00:36:25.284 --> 00:36:26.683
-We always talk.
-[Bobby] We talk a lot.

799
00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:28.218
-Bobby.
-Why did we break up?

800
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.553
Please leave.

801
00:36:29.555 --> 00:36:30.787
Do you really wanna
have this conversation

802
00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:32.422
-in front of mum and dad?
-Yes.

803
00:36:32.424 --> 00:36:33.657
I haven't actually
explained it fully

804
00:36:33.659 --> 00:36:34.991
to mum and dad yet. so maybe--

805
00:36:34.993 --> 00:36:37.827
I'm a changed man.
I've changed everything.

806
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:40.864
A new outlook.
what I do. who I am.

807
00:36:42.301 --> 00:36:45.835
new hobbies. Keith knows.
Keith's the man.

808
00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:52.676
Come on. give it a go.
Keith says you're doing music

809
00:36:52.678 --> 00:36:54.711
and something's going on
with somebody else.

810
00:36:54.713 --> 00:36:57.681
-sounds very strange.
-Nothing's going on.

811
00:36:57.683 --> 00:37:00.684
Before I was not listening
to the music ironically.

812
00:37:00.686 --> 00:37:03.453
Okay. and now I hear it all
and I love fishing now.

813
00:37:03.455 --> 00:37:07.757
everything to do with aquariums.
fish. fish pumps. tank pumps.

814
00:37:07.759 --> 00:37:10.660
And that's been able
to help me make women happy.

815
00:37:10.662 --> 00:37:13.597
I'm a changed man.
I have changed.

816
00:37:14.566 --> 00:37:19.002
There is a lot of change
going on. There's a lot.

817
00:37:19.004 --> 00:37:22.772
And within that change
is change. and more change.

818
00:37:22.774 --> 00:37:26.509
-I used to be about
cars. women. booze.
-[coughs]

819
00:37:26.511 --> 00:37:29.279
And I'm no longer
about that anymore.

820
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:31.348
I like women. sure.
and booze. of course.

821
00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:32.882
but I don't like cars anymore.

822
00:37:32.884 --> 00:37:35.285
-[bartender] Whisky?
-[Eleanor] Just a wee. wee bit.

823
00:37:35.287 --> 00:37:38.588
-A little bit of whisky.
-A wee bit.
a titch. just a titch.

824
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.023
[laughter]

825
00:37:40.025 --> 00:37:42.359
-[man] I think you should stop.
-Good.

826
00:37:42.361 --> 00:37:44.427
[woman] I think
you can. like yeah.

827
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:47.030
a good kiss is definitely
a good indication if
somebody's gonna be right.

828
00:37:47.032 --> 00:37:48.365
-You okay?
-I can be a really good kisser

829
00:37:48.367 --> 00:37:49.599
-with one person.
-Yeah. Bobby.

830
00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:50.834
I can't kiss another person.

831
00:37:50.836 --> 00:37:52.335
You don't-- You don't seem okay.

832
00:37:52.337 --> 00:37:54.271
[Eleanor] You know what.
can I just say

833
00:37:54.273 --> 00:37:57.374
-this whole English thing.
-Is-- We're Welsh.

834
00:37:57.376 --> 00:37:58.975
You had to do that
though. didn't you?

835
00:37:58.977 --> 00:38:01.611
Yeah. I know. I'm kind of.
uh. sorry.

836
00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:03.046
immediately sorry about it.

837
00:38:03.048 --> 00:38:04.514
You made a bit of a scene
though. didn't you?

838
00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:06.049
-[muttering]
-You what?

839
00:38:06.051 --> 00:38:07.284
I'm sorry.

840
00:38:08.654 --> 00:38:11.488
-Sorry?
-Yeah. I'm very sorry.

841
00:38:12.357 --> 00:38:14.024
[Iris] Oh. 'cause you
did sleep with Tash.

842
00:38:14.893 --> 00:38:15.925
Look-- [sighs]

843
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.062
Yeah.

844
00:38:26.438 --> 00:38:27.804
[Eleanor] Fucking mouth.
bring that mouth over here.

845
00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:28.772
Some funny business
going on over there.

846
00:38:28.774 --> 00:38:30.473
that's your friend. aint it?

847
00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:32.709
[Eleanor kissing]
Oh. my god. mm. mm.

848
00:38:32.711 --> 00:38:35.645
Wow! I can drink
that shit. man. what is that?

849
00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:36.980
I feel a bit left out. you know.

850
00:38:36.982 --> 00:38:38.481
Shut up. shut up.

851
00:38:43.555 --> 00:38:45.422
-Should we get out
of here? Yeah.
-Yeah. sure.

852
00:38:45.424 --> 00:38:48.525
[upbeat music]

853
00:38:53.632 --> 00:38:55.565

-Yeah.

Hi.

877
00:41:56.248 --> 00:41:57.780
[Iris] What are we like?

878
00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:01.518
[sighs]

879
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:05.121
Last night was
a certified disaster.

880
00:42:06.157 --> 00:42:06.890
Yeah.

881
00:42:10.795 --> 00:42:11.761
Sure was.

882
00:42:13.899 --> 00:42:15.965
Andrew's. um-- [clears throat]

883
00:42:16.935 --> 00:42:20.236
You know. so nice that he--

884
00:42:20.238 --> 00:42:25.141
Kind. compassionate.
husband material.

885
00:42:25.143 --> 00:42:26.843
-Definitely.
-Okay. I get it. I realize

886
00:42:26.845 --> 00:42:29.112
you don't like him.
Well. neither do I. so--

887
00:42:29.915 --> 00:42:32.015
-Okay. you can say it.
-He's a twat.

888
00:42:33.218 --> 00:42:35.952
-He's an absolute... wanker.
-Absolute.

889
00:42:37.556 --> 00:42:38.588
I'm gonna have
to get rid of him.

890
00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:39.923
-Yes.
-Today.

891
00:42:39.925 --> 00:42:41.357
-Today?
-Oh. god.

892
00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:45.628
-Can you do it for me?
-No. he's got to walk

893
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:47.664
to the train station himself.

894
00:42:49.668 --> 00:42:51.100
Do you think
Bobby's the one though?

895
00:42:54.039 --> 00:42:58.007
Why are you even thinking. Iris?
I was being sarcastic.

896
00:42:59.311 --> 00:43:01.778
He did bring flowers though. so.

897
00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.112
It's really tacky.

898
00:43:04.282 --> 00:43:06.849
Five quid flowers
and he left the label on.

899
00:43:09.354 --> 00:43:15.024
[chuckles] I wouldn't really
say that makes him a stellar
gentleman. would you?

900
00:43:19.331 --> 00:43:24.100
How about you rate. um. Eleanor?

901
00:43:25.003 --> 00:43:27.370
-Why would I rate Eleanor?
-Why wouldn't you rate Eleanor?

902
00:43:27.372 --> 00:43:29.238
-Because--
-I've seen you over the last

903
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.608
-few days. Iris.
-It's really weird.
she's not ratable.

904
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:32.875
-I don't think
of her in that way.
-You flirt with her.

905
00:43:32.877 --> 00:43:34.644
No. she's a friend.

906
00:43:34.646 --> 00:43:36.980
-Okay.
-She's a new friend.

907
00:43:36.982 --> 00:43:38.214
Iris. I'm your sister.

908
00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:42.151
and I've been watching you
the last few days and you--

909
00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:44.387
You do know you flirt
with her. right?

910
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:47.957
-A little bit.
-I mean. I absolutely

911
00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:49.425
-do not flirt with her.
-You do. Yes. you do.

912
00:43:49.427 --> 00:43:51.194
-don't try and cede it.
-Oh. don't even go there.

913
00:43:51.196 --> 00:43:52.929
Why-- Like--

914
00:43:52.931 --> 00:43:54.130
Obviously she's not like.

915
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.001
worst looking person ever.
is she?

916
00:44:00.271 --> 00:44:02.672
She's a bit--
She's a bit complicated.

917
00:44:03.375 --> 00:44:06.042
That's what-- That's what great
people are like. you know.

918
00:44:06.978 --> 00:44:11.648
a lot of the time. I mean.
you know. she's still like--

919
00:44:13.351 --> 00:44:17.153
Just like a statue of

920
00:44:18.189 --> 00:44:20.990
wisdom. and. you know.
incredibleness.

921
00:44:22.861 --> 00:44:24.127
[Abby] Wow.

922
00:44:26.131 --> 00:44:27.764
-Abs?
-Hm?

923
00:44:28.933 --> 00:44:30.099
Play you a song?

924
00:44:31.803 --> 00:44:34.337
-Just been trying it out.
-Yeah.

925
00:44:34.339 --> 00:44:36.305
Can you hold
this for me for a sec?

926
00:44:36.307 --> 00:44:38.174
-Hold it?
-Yes. just hold that.

927
00:44:38.176 --> 00:44:40.009
-Okay. Iris.
-Abs. please.

928
00:44:40.011 --> 00:44:42.378
just sing it along with me
for one sec? Please. Abs.

929
00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.381
I just need a bit
of help with the rhythm.

930
00:44:45.383 --> 00:44:47.216
-Okay.
-And if you think it's catchy.

931
00:44:47.218 --> 00:44:48.818
-then I know I'm onto something.
-Okay. but you know

932
00:44:52.057 --> 00:44:54.207
-I'm not a singer for this bit.
-Doesn't matter.

00:46:18.343 --> 00:46:20.910
Can you just. can you put
the guitar down for a second?

960
00:46:20.912 --> 00:46:22.845
Yeah. sure.

961
00:46:22.847 --> 00:46:23.846
Please.

962
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:26.516
Yeah?

963
00:46:26.518 --> 00:46:29.852
I think it's obvious
what happened last night

964
00:46:29.854 --> 00:46:32.054
and it's obvious
that I can't drink.

965
00:46:32.056 --> 00:46:35.224
And I've been here
before right before you.

966
00:46:35.226 --> 00:46:38.795
and it is not your problem.
it's totally my problem.

967
00:46:38.797 --> 00:46:40.196
but I'm really embarrassed

968
00:46:40.198 --> 00:46:41.864
about what happened
with your parents.

969
00:46:41.866 --> 00:46:44.967
I was in a blackout.
I don't remember anything.

970
00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:46.803
I don't even know
how I got back here.

971
00:46:46.805 --> 00:46:50.306
and I-- You've been nothing
but great to me.

972
00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:55.545
but I did come here to help
you and I have not helped you.

973
00:46:56.514 --> 00:46:59.015
if anything. I feel like
I've made things worse.

974
00:46:59.017 --> 00:47:02.018
and I've just kind of
brought my madness with me.

975
00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.587
and I'm not.
you know. I can't drink.

976
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:08.958
And so. what I've done is
I've written you something.

977
00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.160
and I hope you like it.

978
00:47:12.197 --> 00:47:14.430
And if you don't. that's okay.

979
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.066
It probably needs a lot of work.

980
00:47:17.068 --> 00:47:19.001
but I haven't written
anything in a long time.

981
00:47:19.003 --> 00:47:23.472
-So I really-- I don't know.
-My god. this is amazing.

982
00:47:23.474 --> 00:47:25.842
-Thank you so much.
this is so exciting.
-Hm.

983
00:47:25.844 --> 00:47:28.344
Yeah. but even if it's shit.
will you still forgive me?

984
00:47:28.346 --> 00:47:30.580
It's not gonna be shit.

985
00:47:30.582 --> 00:47:32.148
Then can we just be friends?

986
00:47:33.418 --> 00:47:35.852
Can we just do anything?
I just think you're great.

987
00:47:36.654 --> 00:47:37.987
I think you're great.

988
00:47:39.924 --> 00:47:42.024
-I do.
-Okay. so we just sing it.

989
00:47:42.026 --> 00:47:44.927
-Listen. just don't
get your hopes up.
-You wrote me a song?

990
00:47:44.929 --> 00:47:46.562
-Wait. okay. A major.
-Yeah.

have to come over

1019

when I'm having family time?
It's just not the time.

1020
00:50:37.635 --> 00:50:40.169
-Why are you building
a bloody tent?
-We're having family time.

1021
00:50:40.171 --> 00:50:42.204
It's what we used
to do when we were kids.
it doesn't even matter anyway.

Baby. come here. I haven't
seen you in a while.

-What is that thing?
-Fun.

Be the woman. man. Look at that.

1026

You've always got to come
at private. intimate
family moments.

1027

I didn't know it was.
Keith said to come along.

seen you in a week.

-I know.

1030
00:51:00.158 --> 00:51:01.657
I've been busy.
trust me on that.

1031
00:51:01.659 --> 00:51:04.193
I've been busy too actually.
so I don't really care.

1032
00:51:04.195 --> 00:51:07.530
-What have you been doing?
-I've actually made
a lot of progress with my film.

I don't know.

-She's staying with me
in the summerhouse.

1039
00:51:20.545 --> 00:51:22.778

it's been going
really. really well.

1040
00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.647
I was all a bit nervous
about it at first.

1041
00:51:24.649 --> 00:51:26.282
but it's really come together.

1042
00:51:26.284 --> 00:51:28.818
You know. it's like
a massive movie I've got.

1043
00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:29.885

going through it. I need to just

1077

and a kayak moved passed.
slowly throughout the water.

and they went.

[Eleanor] "You can't have
your kayak and eat it too."

How old are you?

1103

00:54:04.508 --> 00:54:06.275
that's what you wanted
to hear. isn't it?

1105

-I don't know.
-Yeah.

1106
00:54:07.912 --> 00:54:10.813
Well. I just-- I don't know
what's going on here really.

1107
00:54:10.815 --> 00:54:12.548
Oh yeah. what do you
think's going on?

1108
00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:13.949
Something a little bit strange.

Hm. I bet you do.
what kind of strange.

1110

I'd just love to
hear it from you.

I just don't know what your
motive is. what you're into.

1113

-Hm.
-Um. with my girlfriend.

1114

Oh. really.
she's your girlfriend?

1115

Very much so. ask her.
she's not gonna lie.

I. uh-- I don't believe
she's your girlfriend.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:55.737
most thoughtful.

1283
01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:58.873
gorgeous woman

1284
01:07:59.876 --> 01:08:03.078
I've ever. I've ever known.

1285
01:08:06.683 --> 01:08:09.217
I know she's been
preparing us for this day.

1286
01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:12.787
me and Abs and Dad.

1287
01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:21.296
So I know
what she would have wanted.

1288
01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:22.897
and what she does want. which is

1289
01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:26.301
for us to go out
into the world and

1290
01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:28.369
spread our wings and

1291
01:08:29.172 --> 01:08:32.707
find joy and happiness and

1292
01:08:33.677 --> 01:08:38.413
be together for the good
and the bad moments. and

1293
01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:43.451
all the shades in between.
and we're gonna do
you proud. mum.

1294
01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.454
we're gonna be there
for each other. and

1295
01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:50.859
her memory will live on
in our hearts.

1296
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.629
I love you. mum.

1297
01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:05.206
[crying]

1298
01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:14.382
-You came back.
-Hm-mm.

1299
01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.638
-You want some tea?
-Yeah.

1300
01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:41.876
[cutlery clinking]

1301
01:09:42.846 --> 01:09:45.313
-God. I feel so embarrassed.
-Well--

1302
01:09:46.316 --> 01:09:48.816
It was all weird with you
in the summerhouse. eh?

1303
01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:51.686
-[sighs]
-Do you really wanna go there?

1304
01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:55.790
-[chuckles]
-I know. I just--
I'm not usually like that.

1305
01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:57.959
I don't-- I don't know what came
over me. you know. It's just--

1306
01:09:58.962 --> 01:10:00.695
Suddenly it all came out and--

1307
01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:04.299
I'm so embarrassed and I don't
know what to say and then--

1308
01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:10.705
It was a little traumatizing.
I have to say. [chuckles]

1309
01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:13.675
But I'm working through it.
I have professionals to help me.

1310
01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:15.743
-Good.
-[laughs]

1311
01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:17.445
But. um. I actually. um--

1312
01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:20.615
I. uh--

1313
01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:25.486
I don't know.
I just thought about a lot
of the things that went down.

1314
01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:28.890
and I feel like
the energy of us together--

1315
01:10:29.826 --> 01:10:32.794
We did something
that I couldn't have done alone.

1316
01:10:32.796 --> 01:10:34.562
and I don't think you
could have done alone.

1317
01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.898
and we did it together.

1318
01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.902
I actually have written
some of the best songs
I've ever written this week

1319
01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:44.739
and there's no way that I would
have been able to do that

1320
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:48.376
at the worst time of my life.

1321
01:10:49.379 --> 01:10:51.779
have the best thing
also happen to me.

1322
01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:53.848
You know. there's
something about

1323
01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:56.718
when somebody from the outside.

1324
01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.920
like somebody from Mars.
comes in

1325
01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:01.589
and they just decide
to believe in you.

1326
01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.758
[melancholic song playing]

1327
01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.596
And you just decided to come out
of nowhere and believe in me.

1328
01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:13.601
And the power of that is...

1329
01:11:16.373 --> 01:11:17.338
massive.

1330
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.640
Then listen to me.

1331
01:11:18.642 --> 01:11:20.275
you're really talented.

1332
01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:22.076
and your heart is beautiful.

1333
01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:25.813
and your energy is
so crystal clear.

1334
01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:28.950

[man] Fancy?

1338
01:11:39.829 --> 01:11:41.663
No. pasties give me
a bit of heartburn.

1339
01:11:41.665 --> 01:11:44.299
Yeah. well. they're
renowned for it. you know.

1340
01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:49.570
Yeah. nice though. but I can do
any kind of pastry does me
really. pasties--

1341
01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:50.938
I had Welsh cakes the other day.

1342
01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.440
-Oh. yeah.
-They bought me.

1343
01:11:52.442 --> 01:11:54.442
they are quite dry.
quite claggy.

1344
01:11:54.444 --> 01:11:55.777
That's right. it's the dough.

1345
01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:57.712
-I was kind of eating them...
-Yeah.

1346
01:11:57.714 --> 01:11:58.980
They need a bit
of butter on them really.

1347
01:11:58.982 --> 01:12:00.481
Well. they just sit there. see.

1348
01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:01.616
[Keith] They did sit
there for a while.

1349
01:12:01.618 --> 01:12:03.084
Yeah.

1350
01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:04.852
Alright. yeah.
got to be careful.

1351
01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.460
-Hey.
-How are you doing?

1352
01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:14.595
Alright.

1353
01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:16.464
[grunts]

1354

1355
01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:20.868
How's it going in there?

1356
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:26.708
Mental. looks like Keith's
about to get on the decks.

1357
01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.579
Mum would have laughed at that.

1358
01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:33.715
Mum would have really laughed.

1359
01:12:33.717 --> 01:12:35.783
-Like a lot.
-At everything.

1360
01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:38.386
-Yeah.
-The whole scenario.

1361
01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:41.989
So. I've been thinking
after what mum said.

1362
01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:45.059
that I'm gonna spend
more time at home

1363
01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:47.395
-with you and dad.
-Really?

1364
01:12:47.397 --> 01:12:48.830
Yeah.

1365
01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:50.498
What do you think?

1366
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.899
-Really?
-Yeah.

1367
01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:55.837
I think if that makes
you happy. then.

1368
01:12:55.839 --> 01:12:58.005
-it'll make me really happy.
-Good.

1369
01:13:00.677 --> 01:13:03.177
-Done.
-Um.

1370
01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:06.848
Griff was actually
saying the other day.
he called me. and--

1371
01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:10.184
He was saying if I wanna go
to L.A. with the. you know--

1372
01:13:11.388 --> 01:13:13.755
-L.A.?
-L.A. Well. they're
getting all my demos

1373
01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:15.556
in the orchestra room.

1374
01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.392
-But. you know.
-You've got to do that.

1375
01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:20.762
Yeah. but I kind of need
somebody to show me around.

1376
01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:22.663
somebody that's
been there. that--

1377
01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:25.666
You know.
that I loved and trusted.

1378
01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:28.002
Is that
your roundabout way of...

1379
01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:29.704
-Would you?
-...asking your big sister

1380
01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:31.172
to come to L.A. with you.
because you're so gorgeous.

1381
01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:33.441
Well. I'd kind of like
to spend time with you.

1382
01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:34.842
-Really?
-Yeah.

1383
01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:38.179
Aw. Yes. I would love
to do that with you.

1384
01:13:38.181 --> 01:13:40.748
-Really?
-That would be amazing.

1385
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.584
-Yes. 100%.
-And look after me?

1386
01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:45.953
I would definitely.
yes. I'm so in.

1387
01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:48.923
-We'll both do it together.
I think mum--
-Hm.

1388
01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:54.595
-Bobby? Um. I--
-What do you think first

1389
01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:56.497
of the-- the spread.
what do you think?

1390
01:13:56.499 --> 01:13:59.066
We. uh. we went all out with.
uh. cheesy tomatoes.

1391
01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:01.769
thin sliced. um. premium ham.

1392
01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:05.440
with a ham and--
and tomato as well.

1393
01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:08.543
on that one. and then this is
pizzeria. Welsh pastries.

1394
01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:10.978
Do you mind changing the music?
It feels a bit sad and I know

1395
01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:15.516
mum really would have wanted us
to dance. and just have
a bit more fun.

1396
01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:20.521
Um. yeah. no. I'll change it
in a minute. uh--

1397
01:14:20.523 --> 01:14:21.789
Are you okay?

1398
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.126
Yeah.

1399
01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:27.728
Yeah.

1400
01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:30.231
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

1401
01:14:32.469 --> 01:14:33.267
I'm okay.

1402
01:14:34.504 --> 01:14:36.003
Fine.

1403
01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:38.539
