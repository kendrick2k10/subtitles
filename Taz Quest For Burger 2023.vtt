[tribal music playing]

4
00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.938
[Quinn] Once upon a time.

5
00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:28.115
in the heart of wild Australia.

6
00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:31.074
deep in the vast
and boundless landscape

7
00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:32.554
of the Outback.

8
00:00:32.597 --> 00:00:34.991
there lived a village
of bandicoots!

9
00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.037
-[lively music playing]
-[yawns]

10
00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.257
-Morning. Sam.
-Hey. Bill.

11
00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:44.087
[Quinn] These bandicoots
worked hard all year
gathering food.

12
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:46.089
tuber vegetables. mushrooms.

13
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.439
anything the land
could provide.

14
00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:50.615
And provide it did!

15
00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:55.403
When winter came.
the land would be empty.

16
00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:59.059
but the bandicoots' stockpile
would be full.

17
00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:02.192
The bandicoots would celebrate
with a big feast

18
00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:04.846
-before settling in
for the long winter.
-[upbeat music playing]

19
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.414
All their friends were invited!

20
00:01:06.457 --> 00:01:09.547
The emus.
the wombats. the kangaroos.

21
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:12.811
The koalas only liked
to eat eucalyptus leaves.

22
00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:17.164
but with the right spices.
you can't tell the difference.

23
00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:19.862

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.474
[squeals]

25
00:01:23.518 --> 00:01:25.868
The bandicoots
were excellent cooks!

26
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:28.175
The feast was happy and safe.

27
00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:31.482
hidden away from
carnivores and scavengers
and other monsters.

28
00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:34.137
Back then.
the monsters lived far away.

29
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:36.008
on a mysterious island.

30
00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:38.140
Tasmania!

31
00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:39.969
And on Tasmania.

32
00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:43.842
there was one monster worse
than all the others.

33
00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:47.150
-[footsteps thudding]
-A ravenous beast
with long. sharp teeth.

34
00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:49.674
-ready to eat anything
in its path.
-[growls]

35
00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:51.459
Or anyone!

36
00:01:51.502 --> 00:01:53.678
Luckily for
the bandicoot village.

37
00:01:53.722 --> 00:01:56.420
the monster stayed
on the island.

38
00:01:56.464 --> 00:01:58.683
Or so they thought!

39
00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:00.337
[creature growls]

40
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:01.991
That fateful night.

41
00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:04.211
while the village
celebrated their feast.

42
00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:07.518
someone else was preparing for
a feast of his own!

43
00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:10.259
-[growls]
-The Tasmanian terror!

44
00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:11.870
The Tasmanian monster!

45
00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:14.177
The Tasmanian Devil!

46
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:15.613
[snarls]

47
00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:20.140
[howls]

48
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.493
[growls] Tasmanian Devil!
There's no escape! [howls]

49
00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:27.973
Your daughter's quite
the storyteller there.

50
00:02:28.017 --> 00:02:30.280
What's that? Oh! Oh. boy.

51
00:02:30.324 --> 00:02:33.109
[nervously] Uh. Quinn!
Hey. Quinn! [chuckles]

52
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.372
[growls and snarls] Yeah?

53
00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:38.332
H-How would you like
to learn how to grill? Huh?

54
00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:40.899
A little
father-daughter bonding?

55
00:02:40.942 --> 00:02:42.814
-[growling]
-[grunts]

56
00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:44.425
Okay. okay.

57
00:02:44.468 --> 00:02:47.297
I think this story might be
just a little too scary.

58
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:49.081
Don't worry. Dad.

59
00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:51.867
A hero comes in
and saves the day!

60
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.260
[dramatic music playing]

61
00:02:53.303 --> 00:02:55.653
-The Lone Buckaroo!
-[all groaning]

62
00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:57.177
[Stan] Oh. crikey.

63
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.222
[Quinn] The Lone Buckaroo!

64
00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.006
Scourge of the carnivores.

65
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.573
Hero of the Outback.

66
00:03:03.574 --> 00:03:05.750
[creature growls]

67
00:03:06.534 --> 00:03:08.144
[all] Wow!

68
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.798
-[all sarcastically] Wow!
-[Melanie unimpressed] Eh.

69
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:11.756
[growls]

70
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.454
-[all grunting]
-Quinn. stop! please!

71
00:03:13.497 --> 00:03:14.933
Ugh. Hold on.

72
00:03:14.977 --> 00:03:16.239
[dramatic music playing]

73
00:03:17.588 --> 00:03:18.807
Ha!

74
00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:21.549
[growls]

75
00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:23.855
Look out! He's preparing
his signature attack.

76
00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:25.901
The Tasmanian devil spin!

77
00:03:28.512 --> 00:03:31.733
[Aristotle] That's not what
the Tasmanian Devil does.

78
00:03:31.776 --> 00:03:33.125
Yes. it is!

79
00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:35.258
He spins around
really. really fast.

80
00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:37.391
Yeah. but it's not
a somersault. It's a cartwheel.

81
00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:40.611
Hey. have you
ever seen the Tasmanian Devil?

82
00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:42.047
Seen him?

83
00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:44.353
Well. no.

84
00:03:44.398 --> 00:03:46.400
But my dad knows
all about him and--

85
00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:47.923
[all] Oh. my gosh! Oh. my gosh!

86
00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:49.098
You've seen
the Tasmanian Devil?

87
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:50.621
Oh. man. That's so cool!

88
00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:51.970
-How tall is he?
-[boy] How short is he?

89
00:03:52.014 --> 00:03:54.799
Wait! This is my story!

90
00:03:54.843 --> 00:03:58.325
Uh. well. I've never seen
the Tasmanian Devil.

91
00:03:58.368 --> 00:04:00.457
But I know a guy
who knows a guy.

92
00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:01.458
[all] Wow!

93
00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:03.678
I wish my dad knew guys.

94
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:05.593
Oh. does he cartwheel
or somersault?

95
00:04:05.636 --> 00:04:08.857
It's more of
a tornado kinda deal.

96
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.033
-Why did he leave Tasmania?
-Nobody knows.

97
00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:12.948
Uh. does he eat bandicoots?

98
00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:14.602
Well. he eats everything.
so it--

99
00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:16.343
How many of us
could he fit in his mouth?

100
00:04:16.386 --> 00:04:18.562
Like if he really
crammed us in there?

101
00:04:18.606 --> 00:04:20.260
I don't know.

102
00:04:20.303 --> 00:04:22.566
Uh. three. four?

103
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.351
[all exclaim] Cool!

104
00:04:24.394 --> 00:04:27.963
He's not cool!
He's a beast. a monster.

105
00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:31.445
Waiting in the darkness
to eat you alive.

106
00:04:31.488 --> 00:04:32.576
[gasps in fear]

107
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.404
He's not gonna eat you.

108
00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:36.145
He may be scary.

109
00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:38.713
but the Tasmanian Devil hasn't
bothered anyone in years.

110
00:04:38.756 --> 00:04:41.803
-Which means he's hungry.
-[whimpering]

111
00:04:41.846 --> 00:04:43.283
No.

112
00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:46.198
Tonight's the night.
He's coming for ya.

113
00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:48.462
Quinn. stop! He's gonna cry.

114
00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:51.073
-[whimpering]
-Then I better tell him about
the hero that will save him.

115
00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:54.076
-The Lone Buckaroo!
-[crying]

116
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.687
Now. where were we?

117
00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:59.473
Charlie. I believe you were
hiding behind that rock.

118
00:04:59.516 --> 00:05:01.823
-[all grumble]
-[boy grumbling]
The Lone Buckaroo.

119
00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:03.520
Oh. hey! Maybe this time.

120
00:05:03.564 --> 00:05:05.305
The Lone Buckaroo's friends

121
00:05:05.348 --> 00:05:07.611
can help her beat
the Tasmanian Devil.

122
00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:09.831
That way everyone can play.

123
00:05:09.874 --> 00:05:11.963
-[all clamoring excitedly]
-[Quinn] What? Huh?

124
00:05:13.487 --> 00:05:14.314
Fine.

125
00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:18.318
[unenthusiastically]
Once upon a time.

126
00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:20.537
there was a Tasmanian Devil.

127
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:24.236
and he fought the lone
as in a Lone Buckaroo.

128
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.978
-[Taz grunts quizzically]
-Hi-ya!

129
00:05:27.022 --> 00:05:30.286
And her friend.
the other Lone Buckaroo.

130
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.507
No. there's only one of me.

131
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.294
And their friend.
Super Bandicoot!

132
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.600
[Taz grunts]

133
00:05:39.643 --> 00:05:42.124
No super powers! You can only--

134
00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:43.604
[Aristotle howls]

135
00:05:43.647 --> 00:05:47.042
[all shouting excitedly]

136
00:05:53.048 --> 00:05:55.529
Come on. Quinn.
Why don't you join in?

137
00:05:55.572 --> 00:05:57.879
The Lone Buckaroo works alone.

138
00:05:57.922 --> 00:06:01.970
Even if that means
getting eaten. [grunts]

139
00:06:02.013 --> 00:06:03.493
-[ominous music playing]
-[slurps]

140
00:06:03.537 --> 00:06:06.148
[all screaming]

141
00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:07.802
[grunts and groans]

142
00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:09.760
Whoops! Sorry. Quinn.
Let me just fix that for ya.

143
00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:11.980
Aw. it's just Ned.

144
00:06:12.023 --> 00:06:13.938
I thought it was
a real crocodile.

145
00:06:13.982 --> 00:06:15.636
Ned's a real crocodile.

146
00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:17.202
Yeah. but you know what I mean.

147
00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:19.683
Hey. Ned.
Just in time for dinner.

148
00:06:19.727 --> 00:06:22.033
[grunts] Oh. dinner!

149
00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:23.774
[grunts]

150
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.953
One bandicoot style
eucalyptus leaf for the koala.

151
00:06:28.997 --> 00:06:32.696
-Tastes just like
real eucalyptus.
-[Koala] Mmm!

152
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.569
And for the crocodile.
my own recipe.

153
00:06:35.612 --> 00:06:38.136
bandicoot style veggie burgers.

154
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.922
[chuckles]
Tastes just like real. uh.

155
00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:43.098
[clears throat] bandicoots.

156
00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:44.969
[chomping]

157
00:06:45.013 --> 00:06:47.972
I thought Ned was the crocodile
that didn't eat bandicoots.

158
00:06:48.016 --> 00:06:49.365
Oh. no. no. no. He doesn't.

159
00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.454
[chuckles] Ned doesn't
eat meat anymore.

160
00:06:51.498 --> 00:06:52.412
But you used to?

161
00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:53.891
Yup! That's how we met.

162
00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:56.503
I almost ate him.
[chuckles] So embarrassing.

163
00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:59.201
[nervously] Uh. but...
But I told him I knew

164
00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:01.769
how to make veggie burgers
that taste like meat.

165
00:07:01.812 --> 00:07:04.119
So now he eats them instead.

166
00:07:04.162 --> 00:07:05.947
They taste better than meat.

167
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.731
and I don't even have to hunt.

168
00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:10.081
All the other carnivores
think I'm crazy.

169
00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:11.866
I tell them.
hunting is for suckers.

170
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.477
Bandicoot village
is where it's at.

171
00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:17.088
You don't actually
tell carnivores

172
00:07:17.132 --> 00:07:18.655
to come to our village. do you?

173
00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:20.352
Hmm? No! No.

174
00:07:20.396 --> 00:07:22.485
I just tell 'em that
if they tasted these burgers.

175
00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:24.052
they'd never eat meat again.

176
00:07:24.095 --> 00:07:26.141
You should make more.
[chomps]

177
00:07:26.184 --> 00:07:27.185
[chuckles] I wish.

178
00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:28.491
But this stockpile

179
00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:30.232
needs to last us
through the winter.

180
00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:32.800
Aw. jeez. I don't want
to eat all your food.

181
00:07:32.843 --> 00:07:34.236
[chomps and belches]

182
00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.803
Now why don't you
tell me the recipe

183
00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:37.326
so I can make my own?

184
00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:40.198
No way. No. no.
It's too dangerous.

185
00:07:40.242 --> 00:07:43.245
More dangerous than hunting?
They're vegetables!

186
00:07:43.288 --> 00:07:45.595
They're just eggs laid
by a tree.

187
00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:48.119
Okay. I don't actually
know what vegetables are.

188
00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:49.469
but I know there's
nothing dangerous

189
00:07:49.512 --> 00:07:50.644
about tossing 'em on a grill.

190
00:07:57.999 --> 00:07:59.783
Yeah. you don't
wanna overcook it.

191
00:08:00.871 --> 00:08:02.133
Here. let me show you.

192
00:08:03.047 --> 00:08:04.571
[humming]

193
00:08:11.273 --> 00:08:13.231
Okay. now it gets tricky.

194
00:08:13.275 --> 00:08:14.494
[tribal music playing]

195
00:08:14.537 --> 00:08:16.408
if you add
too much scorpion venom.

196
00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:17.671
it's poisonous.

197
00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:19.063
But if you add too little.

198
00:08:19.107 --> 00:08:20.935
even more poisonous.

199
00:08:20.978 --> 00:08:22.545
Don't ask.

200
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:25.548
Overcooking makes it explode.
[clears throat]

201
00:08:25.592 --> 00:08:28.551
While under-cooking
gives it a weird aftertaste.

202
00:08:28.595 --> 00:08:30.510
Also melts your stomach.

203
00:08:30.553 --> 00:08:31.989
Ah. it took me years to learn.

204
00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:34.296
and I'm the only bandicoot
that can do it.

205
00:08:35.732 --> 00:08:38.256
That's why this year's feast
is so special.

206
00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.650
I'm going to teach Quinn
how to cook. [chuckles]

207
00:08:40.693 --> 00:08:42.043
Now where is she. anyway?

208
00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:44.524
[knocking]

209
00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:48.353
[gasping]

210
00:08:48.397 --> 00:08:50.573
-Whoops! Sorry.
-[whimpers and grunts]

211
00:08:50.617 --> 00:08:52.053
Ah. there you are.

212
00:08:52.096 --> 00:08:54.098
How'd you like to learn
how to grill. huh?

213
00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:57.885
Why? So I can bribe Ned
to not eat me?

214
00:08:57.928 --> 00:08:59.234
It's not a bribe.

215
00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:01.279
Ned guards
our village every night.

216
00:09:01.323 --> 00:09:03.064
and we feed him in return.

217
00:09:03.107 --> 00:09:04.413
He's... He's our friend.

218
00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:06.284
I'm a vegetarian now.

219
00:09:06.328 --> 00:09:07.808
Yeah. now.

220
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:09.418
How many bandicoots did you eat

221
00:09:09.461 --> 00:09:11.681
before my dad became
your personal chef?

222
00:09:11.725 --> 00:09:12.856
[sighs]

223
00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:16.773
Uh. why don't you
put those aside?

224
00:09:16.817 --> 00:09:18.209
I think I'm full.

225
00:09:18.253 --> 00:09:19.907
Quinn. where are you're going?

226
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.604
To my room!

227
00:09:21.648 --> 00:09:23.911
Unless you want to give that
to some other kid. too.

228
00:09:23.954 --> 00:09:26.653
Hey. Uh. how big is the room?

229
00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:29.612
My mom says my energy
takes up a lot of space.

230
00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:30.831
[groans] Quinn!

231
00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:32.572
[somber music playing]

232
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:38.273
[sighs] You weren't
very nice to Ned.

233
00:09:38.316 --> 00:09:41.493
So? He tried to eat you.

234
00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:42.973
Well. he didn't know
any better.

235
00:09:43.017 --> 00:09:45.672
Ned has protected us for years.

236
00:09:45.715 --> 00:09:48.370
Anyone can change
if you give them the chance.

237
00:09:48.413 --> 00:09:50.502
I wish we didn't need his help.

238
00:09:50.546 --> 00:09:53.114
Well. needing help is
a good way to make friends.

239
00:09:53.157 --> 00:09:55.333
And the village
has never been safer.

240
00:09:55.377 --> 00:09:57.335
It wasn't always like this.

241
00:09:57.379 --> 00:09:59.033
You're too young to remember.

242
00:09:59.076 --> 00:10:02.471
but there was a time
when we were never safe.

243
00:10:02.514 --> 00:10:04.821
A time when
I couldn't protect everyone.

244
00:10:04.865 --> 00:10:07.737
Now. it's just you and me.

245
00:10:07.781 --> 00:10:09.696
I worry about you.

246
00:10:09.739 --> 00:10:11.262
I know.

247
00:10:11.306 --> 00:10:13.177
Well. that's why I wanted
to teach you to cook.

248
00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:15.092
Maybe it'll get you
out of trouble one day.

249
00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:16.267
like it did for me.

250
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:18.008
You know what I always say...

251
00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:21.533
[both] "If you can't
beat 'em. feed 'em."

252
00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:25.146
But I was telling a story.
and it was just getting good.

253
00:10:25.189 --> 00:10:28.149
Or at least.
I thought so. [sighs]

254
00:10:28.192 --> 00:10:29.672
The other kids think I'm weird.

255
00:10:29.716 --> 00:10:31.500
Yeah. well all kids are weird.

256
00:10:31.543 --> 00:10:35.156
That little one over there
picks his nose with his tail.

257
00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:37.027
Yeah. look.
adventure stories are fun.

258
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:39.769
but they aren't going
to protect you.

259
00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:40.901
I guess.

260
00:10:40.944 --> 00:10:42.642
Here. Tomorrow morning.

261
00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:44.600
you'll learn how to cook.

262
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.080
Now it's bed time.

263
00:10:46.123 --> 00:10:47.777
Can't I read some more?

264
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:48.865
Nope. it's too dark.

265
00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:51.389
Hey! [giggles]

266
00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:54.262
Goodnight. Quinn. Love you.

267
00:10:54.305 --> 00:10:56.917
[Quinn's voice echoing]
Love you too. Dad. Goodnight.

268
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.007
[tribal music playing]

269
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:02.531
[in sing-song voice] Night.

270
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:04.359
[sighs]

271
00:11:07.144 --> 00:11:08.145
[snoring]

272
00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:12.802
[both scream]

273
00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:14.325
-Morning. Quinn!
-[panting]

274
00:11:14.369 --> 00:11:17.546
Your dad asked me
to wake you up extra early.

275
00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:20.941
I always wanted
to be a rooster. [giggles]

276
00:11:20.984 --> 00:11:24.727
[screaming]

277
00:11:29.819 --> 00:11:32.213
Dad? Dad?

278
00:11:32.256 --> 00:11:35.738
Huh. He's probably getting
ingredients from the stockpile.

279
00:11:36.913 --> 00:11:40.438
[gasps] Our food!

280
00:11:40.482 --> 00:11:43.877
It's gone!
Who could have done this?

281
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:45.748
Ned!

282
00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:48.403
[grunting] Ned. Huh?

283
00:11:49.186 --> 00:11:51.014
Wait a minute.

284
00:11:51.058 --> 00:11:54.322
[crying] It wasn't me!
It was dingoes!

285
00:11:54.365 --> 00:11:56.454
Dingoes?

286
00:11:56.498 --> 00:12:00.241
Why didn't you fight them off?
You're supposed to protect us.

287
00:12:00.284 --> 00:12:01.721
These weren't just any dingoes.

288
00:12:01.764 --> 00:12:03.244
It was Rocky's gang!

289
00:12:03.287 --> 00:12:05.420
They're vicious!
There were so many of them.

290
00:12:05.463 --> 00:12:07.248
And one of them
was really big. and--

291
00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:08.597
Ned!

292
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.252
Why would dingoes
take our vegetables?

293
00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:12.906
They're carnivores.

294
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:15.473
They must've heard
about the veggie burgers.

295
00:12:15.517 --> 00:12:21.784
Gee. I wonder how
they heard that. Mr. Big Mouth.

296
00:12:21.828 --> 00:12:25.266
Why didn't you tell them
the recipe takes years
of practice.

297
00:12:25.309 --> 00:12:27.834
and my dad's the only one
who can make them?

298
00:12:27.877 --> 00:12:29.531
-I did!
-And?

299
00:12:29.574 --> 00:12:30.924
They took your dad. too.

300
00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:32.229
[shouts] They what?

301
00:12:32.273 --> 00:12:33.100
[dramatic music playing]

302
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.580
Wait! Come back!

303
00:12:37.844 --> 00:12:40.411
-These tracks lead
into the ocean.
-[panting]

304
00:12:40.455 --> 00:12:42.936
But there's nothing
in that direction except...

305
00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:44.938
[gasps]

306
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:46.635
Tasmania?

307
00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:49.464
Exactly. None of us
have ever been there.

308
00:12:49.507 --> 00:12:51.814
so it's the perfect place
to disappear.

309
00:12:51.858 --> 00:12:53.947
All of our food gone.

310
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.514
And nothing will grow
'til next spring.

311
00:12:56.558 --> 00:12:59.604
What happened. Ned?
Did you fall asleep?

312
00:12:59.648 --> 00:13:01.781
No. he was awake.
I heard him crying all night.

313
00:13:01.824 --> 00:13:03.260
I was not!

314
00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:06.220
I... Okay. maybe I was
a little distracted.

315
00:13:06.263 --> 00:13:08.222
Quinn hurt my feelings
pretty bad.

316
00:13:10.137 --> 00:13:12.879
[nervously] What?
You're a crocodile!

317
00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:15.229
You're supposed
to have thick skin.

318
00:13:15.272 --> 00:13:16.752
Look. it's not important.

319
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:19.363
Let's just go to Tasmania
and get my dad back.

320
00:13:19.407 --> 00:13:22.192
Isn't Tasmania kinda dangerous?

321
00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:23.715
I heard there's carnivores.

322
00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:25.021
and they're even
bigger and meaner

323
00:13:25.065 --> 00:13:26.153
than the ones we have here.

324
00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:27.763
You said it's full of monsters!

325
00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.635
[all clamoring]

326
00:13:31.854 --> 00:13:33.290
[shouts] Enough!

327
00:13:33.334 --> 00:13:35.727
I'm the one
who let this happen. I'll go.

328
00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:37.512
Rocky's gang may be tough.

329
00:13:37.555 --> 00:13:39.427
and they may have
beaten me up once.

330
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.255
and there may be
no reason at all

331
00:13:41.298 --> 00:13:43.474
to expect I'll succeed.
so you know what?

332
00:13:43.518 --> 00:13:44.736
I've changed my mind.

333
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.347
[clapping]

334
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.350
Fine. If none of you
are brave enough.

335
00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:51.613
I'll get someone meaner
than a crocodile

336
00:13:51.656 --> 00:13:53.963
who could take on 100 dingoes.

337
00:13:54.007 --> 00:13:55.443
The Tasmanian Devil?

338
00:13:55.486 --> 00:13:59.055
What? No. no. no. The Lone...

339
00:13:59.099 --> 00:14:01.884
Hey. that's not a bad idea.

340
00:14:01.928 --> 00:14:04.321
Whoa! Nu-uh! Nope. Time out.

341
00:14:04.365 --> 00:14:05.888
The real Tasmanian Devil

342
00:14:05.932 --> 00:14:07.803
is different than the one
from your stories.

343
00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.849
Trust me. the guy's a mess.

344
00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:11.415
He's out to lunch.

345
00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:12.852
And good thing. too.

346
00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:14.331
because if he ever
came to his senses.

347
00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:16.856
he'd probably eat all of us.
including me.

348
00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:19.902
You used to be
a carnivore too. remember?

349
00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:22.078
Although without
my dad's burgers.

350
00:14:22.122 --> 00:14:24.428
maybe you'll go back
to eating meat.

351
00:14:24.472 --> 00:14:25.777
[ominous music playing]

352
00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:29.216
No! No.
I'm still vegetarian. see?

353
00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:33.481
-[chomping] Ugh.
Is mud a vegetable?
-No.

354
00:14:33.524 --> 00:14:35.091
-What about koalas?
-[shouts] No!

355
00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:36.527
Okay. just checking.

356
00:14:36.571 --> 00:14:38.007
Boy. this is gonna be rough.

357
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:40.662
Your dad didn't leave
any burgers behind?

358
00:14:40.705 --> 00:14:42.098
Just one.

359
00:14:42.142 --> 00:14:44.927
And I'm taking it
to the Tasmanian Devil.

360
00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:47.451
If you can't beat 'em.
feed 'em.

361
00:14:47.495 --> 00:14:51.064
Quinn. as your new father.
I forbid you from doing this!

362
00:14:51.107 --> 00:14:52.848
You're not my dad.

363
00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.023
and I don't need your help!

364
00:14:54.067 --> 00:14:55.677
Just like The Lone Buckaroo.

365
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.113
Scourge of the dingoes.

366
00:14:57.157 --> 00:14:59.028
Hero of the bandicoots!

367
00:14:59.072 --> 00:15:00.943
And the Tasmanian Devil.

368
00:15:00.987 --> 00:15:03.032
Eater of dingoes
and of crocodiles...

369
00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:04.816
And of birds and of rocks!

370
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.254
-And bandicoots.
-Yeah. can't forget bandicoots.

371
00:15:07.297 --> 00:15:12.346
Right. That is. if I can even
find where he lives.

372
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:14.261
Oh. I heard he lives
in a spooky cave.

373
00:15:14.304 --> 00:15:15.610
11.2 kilometers.

374
00:15:15.653 --> 00:15:17.960
107 degrees east.
south-east of here.

375
00:15:18.004 --> 00:15:19.657
slightly left of
the billabong tree.

376
00:15:20.658 --> 00:15:24.401
That's very helpful. Thanks.

377
00:15:24.445 --> 00:15:27.100
Quinn! get back here.
young lady!

378
00:15:27.143 --> 00:15:29.972
[sigh] They grow up
so fast these days.

379
00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:33.019
You know. my mom carried me
in her mouth for two years.

380
00:15:33.062 --> 00:15:34.150
Yikes!

381
00:15:34.194 --> 00:15:36.239
[dramatic music playing]

382
00:16:08.054 --> 00:16:10.143
I've been walking all day.

383
00:16:10.186 --> 00:16:12.232
I can't be far now.

384
00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:16.888
That must be it!

385
00:16:16.932 --> 00:16:20.718
Hmm. I wonder if I can
see Tasmania from here.

386
00:16:20.762 --> 00:16:22.764
Hey. that doesn't
look too scary.

387
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.333
That goat even looks
kinda friendly.

388
00:16:27.203 --> 00:16:29.423
[growling loudly]

389
00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:34.167
Suddenly the Tasmanian Devil
doesn't seem so scary.

390
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.951
[ominous music playing]

391
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.214
[nervously] I-I don't think
I should do this.

392
00:16:38.258 --> 00:16:40.738
I don't think I can do this!

393
00:16:40.782 --> 00:16:43.611
Luckily for me.
it never matters what I think.

394
00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:46.353
[grunting]

395
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.618
[creature growling]

396
00:16:53.186 --> 00:16:56.624
-[cautiously] H-hello?
-[creature grumbles]

397
00:16:56.667 --> 00:16:59.627
[echoing] I'm looking for
the Tasmanian Devil!

398
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.803
[creature growling louder]

399
00:17:01.846 --> 00:17:03.283
[thudding]

400
00:17:05.415 --> 00:17:06.502
[belches]

401
00:17:06.547 --> 00:17:07.548
[flies buzzing]

402
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.637
You're the Tasmanian Devil?

403
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.031
Hmm? No. Me. uh. someone else.

404
00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:14.294
Not Taz.

405
00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:18.559
[slurps]

406
00:17:18.602 --> 00:17:21.474
Yes. you are. You're him.

407
00:17:21.518 --> 00:17:25.305
I mean.
you're a little more... stubby.

408
00:17:25.348 --> 00:17:26.915
But it's definitely you.

409
00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.004
Taz not here. Taz dead.

410
00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:32.964
Please. I need your help.
Our food was stolen.

411
00:17:33.008 --> 00:17:34.314
What kind food?

412
00:17:34.357 --> 00:17:36.925
-Vegetables.
-Meh.

413
00:17:36.968 --> 00:17:40.711
-They also took my dad!
-What kind dad?

414
00:17:40.755 --> 00:17:43.671
A bandicoot.
Like me. but bigger.

415
00:17:43.714 --> 00:17:46.065
-Ah! [slurps]
-[chuckles nervously] Hold on.

416
00:17:46.108 --> 00:17:48.980
I don't want you
to eat him. Or me.

417
00:17:49.024 --> 00:17:50.591
That's actually important.

418
00:17:50.634 --> 00:17:52.680
Probably should have
mentioned that first.

419
00:17:52.723 --> 00:17:54.203
But I will pay you!

420
00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:57.337
Feast your eyes on this!

421
00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.556
Ew. what this you bring?

422
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.646
Look like mushroom
making bad mistake.

423
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.518
No! It's food.

424
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:06.128
It's delicious.

425
00:18:06.172 --> 00:18:07.564
[sniffs]

426
00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:10.132
Smell like turtle shell
with no turtle.

427
00:18:10.176 --> 00:18:11.786
I know it doesn't
look like much.

428
00:18:11.829 --> 00:18:13.440
but if you cook it right.

429
00:18:13.483 --> 00:18:16.573
it tastes better than
anything you've ever eaten.

430
00:18:16.617 --> 00:18:19.098
Or anyone. [chuckles nervously]

431
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:21.404
But my dad's the only one
who can cook it.

432
00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:23.014
Help me rescue him.

433
00:18:23.058 --> 00:18:25.539
and he'll make you
all the burgers you can eat.

434
00:18:25.582 --> 00:18:27.845
I'd find him myself.

435
00:18:27.889 --> 00:18:30.718
but I don't know my way
around Tasmania. and--

436
00:18:30.761 --> 00:18:32.067
[shouts] Tasmania?

437
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.852
[slobbering] Me not go
to Tasmania.

438
00:18:34.896 --> 00:18:36.158
Me not Taz.

439
00:18:36.202 --> 00:18:37.725
Hey. wait!

440
00:18:39.205 --> 00:18:41.250
Can I just ask you
some questions?

441
00:18:41.294 --> 00:18:43.078
I won't be annoying or rude.

442
00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.080
Or sometimes
I'm rude by accident.

443
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.734
but only when I'm excited.

444
00:18:46.777 --> 00:18:49.302
[sniffs] It smells awful
in here.

445
00:18:49.345 --> 00:18:52.174
Hmm. better than veggie booger.

446
00:18:52.218 --> 00:18:54.176
You're supposed to cook it.

447
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.699
You know. with fire?

448
00:18:55.743 --> 00:18:57.571
Not in here. though.
It smells like gas.

449
00:18:57.614 --> 00:18:59.181
Is that how
you're supposed to smell

450
00:18:59.225 --> 00:19:00.443
or are you extra smelly?

451
00:19:00.487 --> 00:19:01.836
Aren't you lonely in here?

452
00:19:01.879 --> 00:19:03.577
Why don't you want
to go to Tasmania?

453
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.796
Is it scary?
Did something bad happen there?

454
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.972
Did you eat this
entire whale by yourself?

455
00:19:08.016 --> 00:19:09.278
You did. didn't you?

456
00:19:09.322 --> 00:19:10.975
Doesn't look like
you have any family.

457
00:19:11.019 --> 00:19:12.542
Me have family.

458
00:19:13.413 --> 00:19:14.544
[Quinn] Mmm?

459
00:19:14.588 --> 00:19:16.764
Oh! [chuckles] Very nice.

460
00:19:16.807 --> 00:19:19.723
Yeah. very nice.

461
00:19:19.767 --> 00:19:22.465
No room for little bandy-cooty.

462
00:19:22.509 --> 00:19:24.946
Go away. Me go to bed.

463
00:19:24.989 --> 00:19:26.426
You don't have a bed.

464
00:19:26.469 --> 00:19:28.776
Just a big whale skeleton!

465
00:19:28.819 --> 00:19:30.473
It pull out!

466
00:19:30.517 --> 00:19:32.475
But me sleep on ground.

[grunts] Ow!

468
00:19:35.304 --> 00:19:38.351
Please! I just need someone
who knows Tasmania.

469
00:19:38.394 --> 00:19:40.831
I'll take on Rocky myself.
if I have to.

470
00:19:40.875 --> 00:19:42.877
You say Rocky?

471
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.140
You've heard of him?

472
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.055
That's great!

473
00:19:47.098 --> 00:19:49.405
Think of the adventure
we'll have.

474
00:19:49.449 --> 00:19:50.493
[captivating music playing]

475
00:19:50.537 --> 00:19:52.843
We'll take Tasmania by storm.

476
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.679
Working together. you and me.

477
00:20:02.723 --> 00:20:05.073
[thuds]

478
00:20:05.116 --> 00:20:08.381
We'll fight side by side.
and we'll take on all comers.

Come on!

482
00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:16.954
You're supposed to be
the Tasmanian Devil.

483
00:20:16.998 --> 00:20:18.565
Like this. look.

[growling and babbling]

485
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.701

spin around like this.

I can't give up now.

I've got one more shot.

[triumphant music playing]

494

If I can grill this perfectly.
he won't be able to resist.

495
00:20:50.597 --> 00:20:53.121
He'll have to lead me to Rocky.

"Please don't hurt us. Quinn!

You can have your dad back!"

498
00:20:57.081 --> 00:20:59.301
[as Quinn] Too late
for apologies. Rocky.

499
00:20:59.345 --> 00:21:00.607

Huh?

508
00:21:31.638 --> 00:21:33.335
This never would have happened

509
00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:36.947
if I wasn't so obsessed
with telling dumb stories.

510
00:21:36.991 --> 00:21:39.602

00:31:21.749 --> 00:31:23.098
Hang on. Taz.

716
00:31:23.142 --> 00:31:25.013
They're trying
to make you dizzy.

717
00:31:25.057 --> 00:31:26.058
"Dizzy"?

718
00:31:26.928 --> 00:31:28.582
Me never get dizzy.

719
00:31:28.625 --> 00:31:30.062
[growling]

720
00:31:38.635 --> 00:31:41.160
That was amazing.
You're amazing.

721
00:31:41.203 --> 00:31:42.422

722
00:31:42.465 --> 00:31:44.163

Thanks. Taz.

725
00:31:47.557 --> 00:31:48.776
Hey. wait up.

726
00:31:48.819 --> 00:31:49.908

[Quinn straining]

728
00:31:57.959 --> 00:31:59.613
[panting]

729
00:31:59.656 --> 00:32:03.356
[Quinn] Wow. this is nothing
like I pictured at all.

730
00:32:03.399 --> 00:32:08.056
I mean. it's wild.
but it's so beautiful.

731
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.276
How does it feel to be back?

732
00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:12.626
I'm sure
there's a lot to take in.

733
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:13.844
Yeah.

734
00:32:13.888 --> 00:32:16.586
Take in thorn.
Take in splinter.

735
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.545
Somewhere take in
crocodile tooth.

736
00:32:18.588 --> 00:32:19.589
No.

737
00:32:19.633 --> 00:32:21.765
I mean. what do you feel?

738
00:32:21.809 --> 00:32:23.680
Feel thorn.

739
00:32:23.724 --> 00:32:26.727
No. What do you feel inside?

740
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.251
Thorn inside and outside.

741
00:32:29.295 --> 00:32:31.558
That what make it thorn.

742
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:34.909
Okay. do you want me
to pluck them out?

743
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:36.693
We not have to be friend.

744
00:32:37.694 --> 00:32:38.957
That what you say.

745
00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.481
We don't have to be.

746
00:32:41.524 --> 00:32:43.874
But that doesn't mean
we can't be.

747
00:32:43.918 --> 00:32:46.529
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

748
00:32:46.573 --> 00:32:48.836
I didn't think
you even had friends.

749
00:32:48.879 --> 00:32:50.011
[Taz grumbles]

750
00:32:50.055 --> 00:32:51.491
I mean.
that's not what I meant.

751
00:32:51.534 --> 00:32:53.884
Look. I have trouble
making friends. too.

752
00:32:53.928 --> 00:32:55.582
I'm quiet
when I'm supposed to talk.

753
00:32:55.625 --> 00:32:57.323
I talk when I'm
supposed to be quiet.

754
00:32:57.366 --> 00:33:00.979
It's like everyone
knows the rules but me.

755
00:33:01.022 --> 00:33:03.720
The only one I'm
really close to me is my dad.

756
00:33:03.764 --> 00:33:04.852
And he's...

757
00:33:06.071 --> 00:33:07.637
Not close at all.

758
00:33:07.681 --> 00:33:10.336
Mmm. We find him.

759
00:33:10.379 --> 00:33:12.903
Tasmania only so big.

760
00:33:12.947 --> 00:33:15.341
Bandy cooty only so small.

761
00:33:15.384 --> 00:33:19.127
But no more you order me.
Me know Tasmania.

762
00:33:19.171 --> 00:33:21.608
Maybe I'm not
all the time smart.

763
00:33:21.651 --> 00:33:24.306
But I'm not all the time dumb.

764
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:25.351
You're right.

765
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:26.917
I'm sorry.

766
00:33:27.788 --> 00:33:28.789
Friends?

767
00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:31.313
Friends.

768
00:33:31.966 --> 00:33:33.402
Great.

769
00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:36.188
Now will you let me
take out those thorns?

770
00:33:36.231 --> 00:33:37.841
Yeah. Okay.

771
00:33:38.973 --> 00:33:42.063
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

772
00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:48.113
This is pretty deep

[straining]

774
00:33:49.201 --> 00:33:50.941
Maybe we should leave it?

775
00:33:50.985 --> 00:33:53.814
Yeah. Leave that one. Ow!

776
00:33:53.857 --> 00:33:56.251
Ow. Ow. Ow!

777
00:33:56.295 --> 00:33:59.124
Hey. I found

778
00:33:59.167 --> 00:34:00.821
That one not from today.

All right. kids. bed time.

783
00:34:10.612 --> 00:34:12.353
But I'm so hungry.

-Yeah. me too.
-[bandicoot kids] Me too.

785
00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:15.183
I'm starving.

786
00:34:15.226 --> 00:34:16.793
Well. the sooner
you go to sleep.

787
00:34:16.837 --> 00:34:18.534
the sooner it'll be morning.

788
00:34:18.578 --> 00:34:20.710
Is there gonna be food
in the morning?

789
00:34:20.754 --> 00:34:22.929
Uh...

790
00:34:22.973 --> 00:34:25.150
I can't tell you that.
it would spoil a surprise.
[chuckles nervously]

791
00:34:25.193 --> 00:34:26.976
Look. just go to bed.
all right?

792
00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:28.717
I'm too hungry for this.

793
00:34:28.762 --> 00:34:30.068
-Let's go. Let's go. Move.
-[bandicoot kids grumbling]

794
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.460
Do you want me to keep watch?

795
00:34:32.286 --> 00:34:33.810
Yeah.

796
00:34:33.853 --> 00:34:36.204
Make sure nobody steals
our den. all right?

797
00:34:36.248 --> 00:34:37.161
Thanks. Ned.

798
00:34:37.205 --> 00:34:38.772
You're a big help.

799
00:34:38.815 --> 00:34:41.166
Uh... Okay.

800
00:34:41.208 --> 00:34:42.123
Good night.

801
00:34:43.864 --> 00:34:45.692
[snoring]

802
00:34:47.172 --> 00:34:47.998

803
00:34:48.956 --> 00:34:51.524
[grunting excitedly]

804
00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:54.179
Good morning. I was gonna ask
if you're hungry.

805
00:34:54.222 --> 00:34:57.443
but that's kind of
a dumb question. huh?

806
00:34:57.486 --> 00:34:59.575
You find more veggie booger.

807
00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:02.535
Not exactly. My dad
never taught me the recipe.

808
00:35:02.578 --> 00:35:04.841
but I've seen him make it
a million times.

809
00:35:04.885 --> 00:35:06.974
So I figured I'd do it
for breakfast.

810
00:35:07.017 --> 00:35:09.716
One million breakfast?

811
00:35:09.759 --> 00:35:11.326
I don't mean all at once.

812
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.762
I'm just making one.

813
00:35:12.806 --> 00:35:14.329
Oh.

814
00:35:14.373 --> 00:35:16.375
I'm pretty sure I got
the ingredients. right.

815
00:35:16.418 --> 00:35:18.725
The important ones. anyway.

816
00:35:18.768 --> 00:35:21.554
This might even be
an improvement.

817
00:35:21.597 --> 00:35:23.295
This veggie booger?

818
00:35:23.338 --> 00:35:25.645
-Yeah.
-Why it scream?

819
00:35:25.688 --> 00:35:27.342
[screaming]

820
00:35:27.386 --> 00:35:29.649
Oh. that's just air escaping.

821
00:35:31.303 --> 00:35:32.869
Are you ready to try?

822
00:35:32.913 --> 00:35:36.351
Yeah. yeah. [babbling]

823
00:35:36.395 --> 00:35:39.702
We're going to take it
out of the fire this time.

824
00:35:39.746 --> 00:35:40.660
Okay.

825
00:35:40.703 --> 00:35:42.444
Bon appetit.

826
00:35:46.709 --> 00:35:48.494
Bleh!

827
00:35:48.537 --> 00:35:50.539
Well. how is it?

828
00:35:50.583 --> 00:35:53.238
Tastes like food. only...

829
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:54.935
-Bad.
-Bad?

830
00:35:54.978 --> 00:35:57.764
Yeah. Taste very bad.

831
00:35:57.807 --> 00:35:59.287
Oh.

832
00:35:59.331 --> 00:36:02.638
Well. maybe the recipe
needs some adjusting.

833
00:36:02.682 --> 00:36:04.988
But why are you
still eating it?

834
00:36:05.032 --> 00:36:07.904
Me never have bad food before.

835
00:36:07.948 --> 00:36:09.776
You eat tons of weird stuff.

836
00:36:09.819 --> 00:36:11.734
I watched you eat fire.

837
00:36:11.778 --> 00:36:14.041
Yeah. that taste good.

838
00:36:14.084 --> 00:36:16.435
For me. all food taste good.

839
00:36:16.478 --> 00:36:17.827
Not this.

840
00:36:19.786 --> 00:36:22.180
Ugh. this bad.

841
00:36:22.223 --> 00:36:24.878
Okay. okay. I get it.

842
00:36:24.921 --> 00:36:26.096
Let's just get moving.

843
00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.794
The sooner we find my dad.

844
00:36:27.837 --> 00:36:30.840
the sooner you can have
the real veggie burger.

845
00:36:30.884 --> 00:36:31.928
Come on.

846
00:36:31.972 --> 00:36:33.234
You don't have to finish that.

847
00:36:33.278 --> 00:36:34.931
[belching]

848
00:36:34.975 --> 00:36:37.412
What mean not finish?

849
00:36:37.456 --> 00:36:38.587
Never mind.

850
00:36:39.762 --> 00:36:41.764
[Taz babbling]

851
00:36:45.986 --> 00:36:47.074
Taz!

852

[birds squawking]

853
00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.121
Hey. Taz!

854
00:36:52.122 --> 00:36:54.081
[blows raspberry]

855
00:36:54.124 --> 00:36:57.040
Don't you think
we should be more quiet?

856
00:36:57.084 --> 00:36:59.304
We don't want Rocky
to know we're coming.

857
00:36:59.347 --> 00:37:01.828
It might be better
if we sneak up on him.

858
00:37:03.308 --> 00:37:07.790
Okay. Yeah. we sneak.

859
00:37:07.834 --> 00:37:12.055
[babbling quietly]

860
00:37:13.013 --> 00:37:14.710
That's not how you sneak.

861
00:37:15.407 --> 00:37:16.669
Like this...

862
00:37:16.712 --> 00:37:19.802
Move like a shadow.
flow like water.

863
00:37:22.457 --> 00:37:25.678
[Quinn whispering]
Move like a shadow.
flow like water...

864
00:37:25.721 --> 00:37:27.810
Surprise!

865
00:37:30.509 --> 00:37:32.119
Huh?

866
00:37:32.162 --> 00:37:34.774
See? Now you try.

867
00:37:34.817 --> 00:37:38.299
Move like a shadow.

869
00:37:46.786 --> 00:37:49.005
Here. let me get that for you.

870
00:37:49.049 --> 00:37:50.877
How are you
such a fearsome predator

871
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.183
when you don't even know
how to sneak?

872
00:37:53.227 --> 00:37:55.055
If everyone hears you coming.

873
00:37:55.098 --> 00:37:57.753
they have time
to get out of your way.

874
00:37:57.797 --> 00:38:00.582
Not if me not know
which way me going.

875
00:38:00.626 --> 00:38:02.105
[laughs]

876
00:38:02.149 --> 00:38:04.412
Shh!

877
00:38:04.456 --> 00:38:06.719
Some things better
not to surprise.

878
00:38:07.807 --> 00:38:08.764
[whispering] Like what?

879
00:38:08.808 --> 00:38:09.939

881
00:38:11.158 --> 00:38:12.464
This good example.

882
00:38:12.507 --> 00:38:14.248
Oops. Sorry.

883
00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:17.425
I didn't mean to
sneak up on you there.

884
00:38:17.469 --> 00:38:18.383
[chuckles nervously]

885
00:38:19.862 --> 00:38:20.689
[screaming]

886
00:38:28.131 --> 00:38:28.958
Hang on.

887
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.266
[straining]

888
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.227

[both screaming]

891
00:38:47.281 --> 00:38:48.891
We're safe.

892
00:38:48.935 --> 00:38:52.939
I think. How do you do this
without getting dizzy?

893
00:38:53.766 --> 00:38:55.855
Whoa! Whoa!

894
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.775
If... If only we were heavier.

895
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.260
Finally. some good luck.

896
00:39:10.304 --> 00:39:13.568

Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

00:39:16.092 --> 00:39:18.094
-[creaking]
-Uh...

899
00:39:18.138 --> 00:39:20.488
I think we should all step off
at the same time.

900
00:39:20.532 --> 00:39:23.709
One. two. three!

901
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:27.060
I really am small. huh?

902
00:39:27.103 --> 00:39:29.584
-Ow. Ow. Ow...
-Shoo! Shoo!

903
00:39:29.628 --> 00:39:31.586
[straining]

904
00:39:34.981 --> 00:39:36.417
High five!

905
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.027
Ow!

906
00:39:39.115 --> 00:39:40.900
Taz! Oh. my gosh!

907
00:39:40.943 --> 00:39:42.162
Are you okay?

908
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:44.947
[straining]

909
00:39:48.298 --> 00:39:50.300
How come ground move?

910
00:39:50.344 --> 00:39:51.606
We have earthquake?

911
00:39:55.175 --> 00:39:57.743
Quinn! You find dad!

912
00:39:57.786 --> 00:39:59.571
Look just like him.

913
00:39:59.614 --> 00:40:01.442
You raise fine daughter.

914
00:40:01.486 --> 00:40:05.838
Aw! Thanks. But I think
you're seeing double.

915
00:40:05.881 --> 00:40:07.709
You're just dizzy. that's all.

916
00:40:07.753 --> 00:40:09.581
Taz never dizzy!

917
00:40:09.624 --> 00:40:11.800
Oh. yeah. That's right...

918
00:40:11.844 --> 00:40:13.715
Maybe me hit head?

919
00:40:13.759 --> 00:40:15.978
You think
that's what caused it?

920
00:40:16.022 --> 00:40:18.546
No. I think maybe that fix it.

921
00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.026
-[thumping]
-No.

922
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:21.244
-No.
-Stop!

923
00:40:21.288 --> 00:40:23.203
You're going to make it worse!

924
00:40:23.246 --> 00:40:25.161
That one not on purpose.

925
00:40:25.205 --> 00:40:26.380
[groans]

926
00:40:27.337 --> 00:40:29.296
Taz!

927
00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:32.038
Uh-oh. Brain fell out.

928
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:34.170
You take.
In case you need extra.

929
00:40:35.345 --> 00:40:37.173
This isn't a brain.

930
00:40:37.217 --> 00:40:39.349
It's a potato!

931
00:40:39.393 --> 00:40:40.960
Give back if you no like.

932
00:40:41.003 --> 00:40:44.311
No. no. no.
I mean. this a potato.

933
00:40:44.354 --> 00:40:45.747
And your brain is fine.

934
00:40:46.531 --> 00:40:48.097
Mostly.

935
00:40:48.141 --> 00:40:50.709
Do you realize what this means?

936
00:40:51.971 --> 00:40:52.798
Yeah.

937
00:40:53.755 --> 00:40:55.365
But you say first.

938
00:40:55.409 --> 00:40:58.238
This is from our stockpile!

939
00:40:58.281 --> 00:41:00.109
Rocky and the Dingoes
came this way.

940
00:41:00.153 --> 00:41:02.938
[gasps] Look at these tracks.

941
00:41:02.982 --> 00:41:06.899
Hmm. They must be dragging
our food on a sled!

942
00:41:12.426 --> 00:41:15.385
They left the rainforest
and crossed over those plains.

943
00:41:15.429 --> 00:41:18.258
Don't you see?
We're getting close.

944
00:41:18.301 --> 00:41:21.435
We're going to find my dad!
Ya-hoo!

945
00:41:22.392 --> 00:41:24.003
Hurry! Hurry!

946
00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:27.267
Oh. I wish there was
a faster way for us to travel.

947
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.836
Maybe that eagle would have
helped us if we didn't
knock him out of the sky.

948
00:41:30.879 --> 00:41:33.665
and catapult him into the sun.

949
00:41:33.708 --> 00:41:35.144
Not need eagle.

950
00:41:35.188 --> 00:41:38.583
No one faster
than Tasmanian Devil!

951
00:41:38.626 --> 00:41:40.367
[groans]

952
00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:41.542
Wait.

953
00:41:41.586 --> 00:41:42.500
Can do this.

954
00:41:46.112 --> 00:41:47.679
[groans]

955
00:41:50.377 --> 00:41:53.946
Hey. hey!
Maybe you should stop spinning.

956
00:41:53.989 --> 00:41:58.603
[gasps] If me not spin.
me not Tasmanian Devil!

957
00:41:58.646 --> 00:42:00.648
Maybe me wombat.

958
00:42:00.692 --> 00:42:04.173
or big stinky mouse.
[sniffs] Ugh!

959
00:42:04.217 --> 00:42:05.914
No. no.

960
00:42:05.958 --> 00:42:07.916
I shouldn't have rushed you.

961
00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.484
We can slow down
for a little while.

962
00:42:10.528 --> 00:42:13.182
Can you see the trail?
Or do you need help?

963
00:42:13.226 --> 00:42:14.793
Me not need help!

964
00:42:14.836 --> 00:42:15.707
[thuds]

965
00:42:17.752 --> 00:42:19.754
-[groans softly]
-There's nothing wrong
with needing help.

966
00:42:21.147 --> 00:42:22.931
It's a good way
to make friends.

967
00:42:22.975 --> 00:42:23.845
Come on!

968
00:42:32.854 --> 00:42:34.595
[eerie music playing]

969
00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:38.164
Hmm.

970
00:42:38.207 --> 00:42:41.297
Looks like the trail's leading
towards those mountains.

971
00:42:41.341 --> 00:42:43.386
I didn't know
you had mountains.

972
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.127
You have everything here!

973
00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:46.738
[echoes] It's wonderful!

974
00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:51.786
Scary but wonderful.

975
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.702
It must have been a fun place
to explore when
you're growing up.

976
00:42:56.965 --> 00:42:58.271
It okay.

977
00:42:59.054 --> 00:43:00.882
Just okay?

978
00:43:00.926 --> 00:43:03.102
It's in your name!

979
00:43:03.145 --> 00:43:06.105
That's like if I were from
a place called "Quinnsland"
or something.

980
00:43:06.148 --> 00:43:08.760
My dad says
I'm named after my mom.
which makes sense.

981
00:43:08.803 --> 00:43:11.632
It would be weird if I was
named before her. right?

982
00:43:11.676 --> 00:43:13.547
But I've never met my mom.
What about you?

983
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:14.722
What are your parents like?

984
00:43:14.766 --> 00:43:17.203
-Me run away.
-Wow. really?

985
00:43:17.246 --> 00:43:20.119
A runaway?
Sounds like a good story.

986
00:43:20.162 --> 00:43:21.468
Bad memory.

987
00:43:21.511 --> 00:43:22.948
Bad memories
are the best stories!

988
00:43:22.991 --> 00:43:24.645
What did you do
after you ran away?

989
00:43:24.689 --> 00:43:26.821
Bad things.

990
00:43:26.865 --> 00:43:29.258
Like what?
[gasps] Wait! What if
it's not your head that's
making you dizzy?

991
00:43:29.302 --> 00:43:31.043
What if it's a memory
you don't even remember?

992
00:43:31.086 --> 00:43:32.958
You know.
like from your subconscious?

993
00:43:33.001 --> 00:43:34.524
You've got to
tell me everything!

994
00:43:34.568 --> 00:43:36.178
It's like. imagine you were bit
by a snake.

995
00:43:36.222 --> 00:43:37.702
and I have to suck out
the poison!

996
00:43:37.745 --> 00:43:38.703
Let's do the memory first.

997
00:43:38.746 --> 00:43:40.966
What's your worst memory?

998
00:43:41.009 --> 00:43:42.489
Me feel lost.

999
00:43:42.532 --> 00:43:43.490
Uh-huh!

1000
00:43:43.533 --> 00:43:45.318
Me not know where to go.

1001
00:43:45.361 --> 00:43:47.625
Yes! Tell me more!

1002
00:43:47.668 --> 00:43:48.626
That all.

1003
00:43:49.801 --> 00:43:50.671
We lost.

1004
00:43:52.107 --> 00:43:53.021
Oh.

1005
00:43:53.065 --> 00:43:55.850
You mean the trail. Rats.

1006
00:43:55.894 --> 00:43:59.549
Well. things can only
go up from here.

1007
00:43:59.593 --> 00:44:01.160
Why won't you tell me
what you did?

1008
00:44:01.203 --> 00:44:03.249
It can't be that bad.

1009
00:44:03.292 --> 00:44:05.381
It's not like you stole
a bunch of food
and kidnapped my dad.

1010
00:44:05.425 --> 00:44:07.514
As long as you're not Rocky.
you're okay in my book.

1011
00:44:07.557 --> 00:44:10.212
-Speaking of books--
-How come you talk
when me have headache?

1012
00:44:10.256 --> 00:44:11.953
And quiet when near snake?

1013
00:44:11.997 --> 00:44:14.042
Always wrong time you talk!

1014
00:44:14.086 --> 00:44:15.609
[both grunting]

1015
00:44:17.306 --> 00:44:19.874
Sorry for trying
to get to know you.

1016
00:44:19.918 --> 00:44:22.485
You're the one who wanted
to be friends
in the first place.

1017
00:44:22.529 --> 00:44:24.662
-Not me.
-Oh. yeah?

1018
00:44:24.705 --> 00:44:25.924
Yeah!

1019
00:44:26.968 --> 00:44:28.753
I didn't want your help.

1020
00:44:28.796 --> 00:44:31.146
I wanted to come here
by myself.

1021
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:33.888
Well. me just here
for veggie booger.

1022
00:44:33.932 --> 00:44:37.065
[mockingly] Oh. you'll get your
"veggie booger"!

1023
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:39.111
I can't wait to pay you.

1024
00:44:39.154 --> 00:44:40.765
so I never
have to see you again!

1025
00:44:40.808 --> 00:44:43.463
Yeah. and me not have to hear
little bandy cooty!

1026
00:44:43.506 --> 00:44:45.639
Fine. then!
We don't have to talk!

1027
00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:48.598
And when this is over.
we'll never speak again.

1028
00:44:48.642 --> 00:44:49.730
-Good.
-Good.

1029
00:44:49.774 --> 00:44:51.079
-Yeah. that good.
-Very good!

1030
00:44:51.123 --> 00:44:52.602
Total silence.
never speak again.

1031
00:44:52.646 --> 00:44:54.996
-[Taz] Yeah. never talk.
-[Quinn] Fine by me.

1032
00:44:55.954 --> 00:44:58.043
And another thing.

1033
00:44:58.086 --> 00:45:01.611
instead of making imaginary
friends out of seaweed.

1034
00:45:01.655 --> 00:45:05.441
maybe jump in the water
and take a bath instead! Ugh!

1035
00:45:05.485 --> 00:45:09.663
Maybe you read book about
not being nosy little
bandy cooty!

1036
00:45:10.838 --> 00:45:13.667
I'm intellectually curious.

1037
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.103
That for sure.

1038
00:45:15.147 --> 00:45:17.627
Hey! What do you mean by that?

1039
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:21.588
And since when
are you Mr. Clever?

1040
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:24.069
I happen to be... uh...

1041
00:45:24.983 --> 00:45:27.899
[shivering] Freezing.

1042
00:45:27.942 --> 00:45:29.857
It's cold up here.

1043
00:45:29.901 --> 00:45:31.859
It get cold everywhere.

1044
00:45:33.818 --> 00:45:35.297
Winter.

1045
00:45:51.705 --> 00:45:53.794
Hey! A snow flake!

1046
00:45:53.838 --> 00:45:56.579
Let's have a contest to see who
can catch the most
on their tongues.

1047
00:45:58.277 --> 00:46:00.322
[chomping]

1048
00:46:01.715 --> 00:46:03.195
Listen. Ned.

1049
00:46:03.238 --> 00:46:05.240
We've been talking and...

1050
00:46:05.284 --> 00:46:07.503
We don't think we need you
to guard us anymore.

1051
00:46:07.547 --> 00:46:08.548
You don't?

1052
00:46:08.591 --> 00:46:09.897
I mean. it wouldn't be fair.

1053
00:46:09.941 --> 00:46:12.160
We can't make
your veggie burgers.

1054
00:46:12.204 --> 00:46:13.945
And you must be getting hungry.

1055
00:46:13.988 --> 00:46:15.642
Probably getting real hungry.

1056
00:46:15.685 --> 00:46:17.775
Well. sure.
but we're all hungry.

1057
00:46:17.818 --> 00:46:20.081
That's true!
I've lost a lot of weight.

1058
00:46:20.125 --> 00:46:21.866
Just skin and bones here.

1059
00:46:21.909 --> 00:46:23.432
With no meat at all!

1060
00:46:23.476 --> 00:46:25.304
Not like the koala.

1061
00:46:25.347 --> 00:46:28.350
At least he's still got
eucalyptus leaves to eat.

1062
00:46:28.394 --> 00:46:32.006
Juicy little guy's been housing
eucalyptus. I tell ya.

1063
00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:35.488
And look at them thighs!

1064
00:46:35.531 --> 00:46:38.447
I'll keep watch for free
if it makes you feel safe.

1065
00:46:38.491 --> 00:46:40.014
We feel safe...

1066
00:46:40.058 --> 00:46:42.408
Even when you're not here.

1067
00:46:42.451 --> 00:46:43.409
Oh.

1068
00:46:43.452 --> 00:46:45.106
Oh. I see.

1069
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:48.153
These snowflakes are actually
kinda filling though.

1070
00:46:52.244 --> 00:46:54.376
We have to keep moving.

1071
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.291
Too dark. Sleep here.

1072
00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:57.858
What do you know?

1073
00:46:57.902 --> 00:47:00.687
It was you getting hurt
that slowed us down.

1074
00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:02.863
Hey! What are you doing?

1075
00:47:02.907 --> 00:47:04.343
Hmm.

1076
00:47:04.386 --> 00:47:07.520
Say here it bad to fall off
mountain and die.

1077
00:47:07.563 --> 00:47:10.001
Say that maybe slow you down.

1078
00:47:10.044 --> 00:47:12.873
[sarcastically] Wow.
This good book.

1079
00:47:12.917 --> 00:47:14.614
Gimme that!

1080
00:47:14.657 --> 00:47:17.225
I never should have
taught you sarcasm.

1081
00:47:17.269 --> 00:47:19.837
Promise we'll go
first thing in the morning!

1082
00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.882
-Promise.
-Fine.

1083
00:47:21.926 --> 00:47:23.928
But I'm still
not talking to you.

1084
00:47:23.971 --> 00:47:26.234
Let's see how you enjoy
the silent treatment.

1085
00:47:29.281 --> 00:47:31.370
[snoring]

1086
00:47:32.893 --> 00:47:36.505
Of course
he snores in his sleep.

1087
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:37.637
[Taz] Me awake.

1088
00:47:38.377 --> 00:47:40.814
I keep watch.

1089
00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:42.903
[snoring continues]

1090
00:47:42.947 --> 00:47:45.253
Well. I can't sleep like this.

1091
00:47:45.297 --> 00:47:47.734
Maybe you need lullaby.

1092
00:47:47.777 --> 00:47:51.781
♪ Hush little
Bandy cooty thing ♪

1093
00:47:51.825 --> 00:47:54.306
♪ Wiggle you around ♪

1094
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:56.308
♪ And sing. sing. sing ♪

1095
00:47:56.351 --> 00:47:58.179
I don't need a lullaby.

1096
00:47:58.223 --> 00:48:00.399
Maybe warm milk?

1097
00:48:00.442 --> 00:48:03.532
What I need is for you
to leave me alone.

1098
00:48:03.576 --> 00:48:08.450
Why don't you go. um...
sleep in that cave over there.

1099
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:11.627
Sleep in cave?

1100
00:48:11.671 --> 00:48:13.107
Why not?

1101
00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:15.544
You didn't want to leave
your cave when we met.

1102
00:48:15.588 --> 00:48:17.590
Maybe that's where you belong.

1103
00:48:17.633 --> 00:48:20.462
I mean. you only came out
for food. right?

1104
00:48:20.506 --> 00:48:22.682
Uh. yeah.

1105
00:48:22.725 --> 00:48:23.944
Food.

1106
00:48:23.988 --> 00:48:25.728
Great. Goodnight.

1107
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:36.914
[shivering]

1108
00:48:38.872 --> 00:48:40.918
The fire went out. Taz!

1109
00:48:42.397 --> 00:48:43.964
Oh. right.

1110
00:48:44.008 --> 00:48:45.531
I better build another.

1111
00:48:50.014 --> 00:48:52.755
I hope he isn't too cold
in there.

1112
00:48:52.799 --> 00:48:55.454
How else was I
supposed to sleep?

1113
00:48:55.497 --> 00:48:58.022
I wonder where he learned
that lullaby.

1114
00:48:58.065 --> 00:49:00.198
He'd probably just get mad
if I asked.

1115
00:49:00.241 --> 00:49:02.461
[mockingly] "What for you
ask me about past?"

1116
00:49:02.504 --> 00:49:04.463
"We not friends now."

1117
00:49:04.506 --> 00:49:08.119
[snickering] Hey!
I do a pretty good Taz.

1118
00:49:08.162 --> 00:49:10.643
[imitates Taz's warbling]

1119
00:49:10.686 --> 00:49:13.951
"Me smell veggie booger."

1120
00:49:13.994 --> 00:49:16.692
Wait a minute.
[sniffs]

1121
00:49:17.737 --> 00:49:21.610
"Me do smell veggie booger."

1122
00:49:21.654 --> 00:49:23.569
[cackling in distance]

1123
00:49:25.571 --> 00:49:27.877
[gasps] Oh my gosh!

1124
00:49:27.921 --> 00:49:29.879
Is that Rocky's gang?

1125
00:49:29.923 --> 00:49:31.664
I can't see from here.

1126
00:49:31.707 --> 00:49:33.971
I need to wake Taz so we can
sneak up for a closer look.

1127
00:49:34.014 --> 00:49:36.103
Wait. What am I saying?

1128
00:49:36.147 --> 00:49:37.670
Taz can't sneak.

1129
00:49:37.713 --> 00:49:40.194
Even his shadow makes a noise.

1130
00:49:40.238 --> 00:49:42.588
It makes a smell.

1131
00:49:42.631 --> 00:49:45.765
I'll just get a closer look
and come right back.

1132
00:49:45.808 --> 00:49:48.115
And I won't try
and play the hero.

1133
00:49:51.684 --> 00:49:54.426
I am going to wear the mask.

1134
00:49:54.469 --> 00:49:56.341
but only because it's cold.

1135
00:49:56.384 --> 00:49:59.822
If that's Rocky's gang.
they probably have look outs.

1136
00:49:59.866 --> 00:50:03.304
And they'll be listening for
even the slightest sound.

1137
00:50:04.566 --> 00:50:06.916
[music playing]

1138
00:50:11.095 --> 00:50:15.403
I'm 99.99 percent sure
that's them.

1139
00:50:15.447 --> 00:50:17.492
[all laughing]

1140
00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:20.147
Our vegetables!

1141
00:50:23.194 --> 00:50:25.065
[cheering]

1142
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:26.893
Thank you. thank you.

1143
00:50:26.936 --> 00:50:28.677
I got to hand it to you. Rocky.

1144
00:50:28.721 --> 00:50:30.940
You play a mean fiddle.

1145
00:50:30.984 --> 00:50:33.378
Yeah. Boss. that was great.

1146
00:50:33.421 --> 00:50:35.380
What about me?

1147
00:50:36.816 --> 00:50:39.340
Uh. you did good too. Butch.

1148
00:50:39.384 --> 00:50:42.735
Yeah. I like that you weren't
trying to do too much.

1149
00:50:42.778 --> 00:50:44.606
Aw. thanks.

1150
00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:46.434
This is great!

1151
00:50:46.478 --> 00:50:48.480
Sure beats hunting
for food all night.

1152
00:50:48.523 --> 00:50:50.003
Ah. you said it!

1153
00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:52.397
That dopey crocodile was right
about one thing.

1154
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.312
Hunting is for suckers.

1155
00:50:54.355 --> 00:50:58.272
Speaking of which. all this
dancing is making me hungry.

1156
00:50:58.316 --> 00:51:01.145
Well. perhaps we should
wake the Chef.

1157
00:51:01.188 --> 00:51:03.234
Rise and shine.

1158
00:51:03.277 --> 00:51:04.583
[gasps]

1159
00:51:04.626 --> 00:51:07.020
The boys and I
are feeling peckish.

1160
00:51:07.064 --> 00:51:08.674
What do you recommend?

1161
00:51:08.717 --> 00:51:10.328
[muffled speaking]

1162
00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:13.461
Hmm. veggie burgers?
Is that what you said?

1163
00:51:13.505 --> 00:51:15.376
That's what it sounded like.

1164
00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:18.466
Alright!
Veggie burgers all around.

1165
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.252
The kitchen is yours.

1166
00:51:21.295 --> 00:51:23.558
Oh. and Chef?

1167
00:51:23.602 --> 00:51:26.866
I heard these veggie burgers
could be dangerous if you don't
make them right.

1168
00:51:26.909 --> 00:51:30.913
Years of practice. I heard.
Or else... [croaking]

1169
00:51:30.957 --> 00:51:34.874
That's why Lou here.
is going to have the first bite

1170
00:51:34.917 --> 00:51:37.137
-[gulps] I am?
-You are!

1171
00:51:37.181 --> 00:51:39.226
And if anything
bad happens to him.

1172
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:42.229
I'm going to lodge
a very serious complaint.

1173
00:51:42.273 --> 00:51:46.320
And believe me. you're not
going to like where I lodge it.

1174
00:51:46.364 --> 00:51:48.017
Understand?

1175
00:51:48.061 --> 00:51:50.585
Ah. thanks for looking out
for me. boss.

1176
00:51:50.629 --> 00:51:52.544
And no onions. neither.

1177
00:51:52.587 --> 00:51:53.893
Acid reflux.

1178
00:51:55.155 --> 00:51:56.678
Now's my chance.

1179
00:51:56.722 --> 00:51:58.985
I can't wait for Taz.

1180
00:51:59.028 --> 00:52:02.162
I've got to get my dad out
of here and bring our food
back to the village.

1181
00:52:02.206 --> 00:52:04.643
If I'm quiet enough
to startle a snake.

1182
00:52:04.686 --> 00:52:08.168
I can definitely sneak past
these guys.

1183
00:52:08.212 --> 00:52:09.865
-[snake hissing]
-[Quinn screams]

1184
00:52:12.216 --> 00:52:14.174
What do we have here?

1185
00:52:14.218 --> 00:52:15.132
Aw. nuts.

1186
00:52:15.175 --> 00:52:16.785
Another bandicoot.

1187
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:18.787
I know you said we wouldn't
have to hunt no more.

1188
00:52:18.831 --> 00:52:21.050
but this is crazy.

1189
00:52:21.094 --> 00:52:23.575
You think that Chef would mind
throwing this on the grill. eh?

1190
00:52:23.618 --> 00:52:26.404
-Or is that too much?
-That's a bit much. Lou.

1191
00:52:26.447 --> 00:52:27.796
Maybe if boss asks.

1192
00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.842
Oh. I do have some questions.

1193
00:52:29.885 --> 00:52:32.714
Here's one.
Do you know this bandicoot?

1194
00:52:32.758 --> 00:52:33.976
[muffled speaking]

1195
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.631
What's he saying?
Is that a "yes"?

1196
00:52:36.675 --> 00:52:38.372
Maybe take the mask off.

1197
00:52:38.416 --> 00:52:40.679
Let go of my dad.
you big jerks.

1198
00:52:40.722 --> 00:52:42.637
Before I do something I regret.

1199
00:52:42.681 --> 00:52:45.074
Your dad? Well...

1200
00:52:45.118 --> 00:52:47.338
You came all the way
to Tasmania.

1201
00:52:47.381 --> 00:52:49.122
all the way to this mountain.

1202
00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:52.560
all by yourself
just to save your dad?

1203
00:52:52.604 --> 00:52:55.302
I'm impressed. That's family.

1204
00:52:55.346 --> 00:52:56.956
Like you would know.

1205
00:52:56.999 --> 00:52:58.740
Of course I would.

1206
00:52:58.784 --> 00:53:00.612
This is my family.

1207
00:53:00.655 --> 00:53:03.223
That's Butch. Lou. Sid...

1208
00:53:03.267 --> 00:53:05.182
I'm Rocky by the way.

1209
00:53:05.225 --> 00:53:09.621
You must be Quinn.
I've heard so much about you.

1210
00:53:09.664 --> 00:53:12.624
That's why we gagged him.

1211
00:53:12.667 --> 00:53:15.061
Your dad's part of the
family now.

1212
00:53:15.104 --> 00:53:17.542
Which makes you family. too.

1213
00:53:17.585 --> 00:53:20.849
There's no rules saying
you have to be a Dingo.

1214
00:53:20.893 --> 00:53:24.984
You just have to be brave.
tough. and ready for adventure.

1215
00:53:25.027 --> 00:53:27.943
Do you also have to be a dirty.
rotten thief?

1216
00:53:27.987 --> 00:53:29.641
It definitely helps.

1217
00:53:29.684 --> 00:53:32.687
But we're willing to train
the right candidate.

1218
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:34.863
We are looking for more cooks.

1219
00:53:34.907 --> 00:53:37.170
Did your dad teach you
how to cook. Hey. hey?

1220
00:53:37.823 --> 00:53:39.216
[thumping]

1221
00:53:42.828 --> 00:53:44.264
No. huh?

1222
00:53:44.308 --> 00:53:45.961
It's never too late to learn.

1223
00:53:46.005 --> 00:53:47.615
Let me go!

1224
00:53:47.659 --> 00:53:48.834
Let... [muffled speaking]

1225
00:53:48.877 --> 00:53:52.054
No talking during class please.

1226
00:53:52.098 --> 00:53:54.318
Oh. yeah!
I see the resemblance.

1227
00:54:05.198 --> 00:54:06.068
[Taz sniffs] Hmm?

1228
00:54:12.901 --> 00:54:15.208
You make secret veggie booger.

1229
00:54:15.252 --> 00:54:17.384
That why you tell me
to sleep in cave?

1230
00:54:18.342 --> 00:54:19.212
Wait.

1231
00:54:21.258 --> 00:54:23.608
How come no food?

1232
00:54:23.651 --> 00:54:25.000
How come no fire?

1233
00:54:26.698 --> 00:54:28.482
How come no Quinn?

1234
00:54:28.526 --> 00:54:32.007
[gasps] How come no food?

1235
00:54:32.051 --> 00:54:34.619
Okay. me have to think.

1236
00:54:34.662 --> 00:54:37.230
Where I go if me Quinn?

1237
00:54:38.449 --> 00:54:40.146
[Quinn mumbling]

1238
00:54:40.189 --> 00:54:42.322
[mockingly] "I go find Rocky
all alone.

1239
00:54:42.366 --> 00:54:45.673
Even though me only little
bandy cooty."

1240
00:54:45.717 --> 00:54:46.761
Hey. that pretty good.

1241
00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:51.026
Also pretty bad.

1242
00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:55.292
Isn't this lovely? A dad
teaching his daughter
how to grill!

1243
00:54:55.335 --> 00:55:00.601
It's always good to have
a backup chef. in case
something very bad happens.

1244
00:55:00.645 --> 00:55:02.690
In fact. let's all
pay attention!

1245
00:55:03.865 --> 00:55:05.693
Go ahead. Chef.

1246
00:55:09.088 --> 00:55:14.354
[giving muffled instructions]

1247

I was just saying that you want
to sear the outside first.

the juices in. and then
you bring the heat down.

no matter what happens.
you love her very much.

1419
01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.468
You were just a mixed up kid.

1420
01:05:50.511 --> 01:05:52.339
who was lonely and scared.

1421
01:05:52.383 --> 01:05:55.081
And you made mistakes
just like me.

1422
01:05:56.169 --> 01:05:58.389
I'm sorry I was so mean.

1423
01:05:58.432 --> 01:06:00.869
I just wanted to know you
and I couldn't understand

1424
01:06:00.913 --> 01:06:03.611
why you didn't
want to talk about your past.

1425
01:06:03.655 --> 01:06:06.092
I figured you just
thought I was annoying

1426
01:06:06.136 --> 01:06:07.485
like everyone else.

1427
01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:10.618
Either that
or you're embarrassed

1428
01:06:10.662 --> 01:06:12.664
because you don't know
how to speak in the past tense.

1429
01:06:12.707 --> 01:06:14.187
That not fair.

1430
01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:16.276
This Taz third language.

1431
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.844
Wow. really?

1432
01:06:18.887 --> 01:06:20.933
See. there's so much
I don't know.

1433
01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:22.804
[Rocky] And you never will!

1434
01:06:24.328 --> 01:06:25.982
His story ends here!

1435
01:06:27.157 --> 01:06:28.549
I don't think so. Rocky!

1436
01:06:29.072 --> 01:06:30.377
[grunts]

1437
01:06:30.421 --> 01:06:32.162
[groans]

1438
01:06:33.163 --> 01:06:33.990
Dad!

1439
01:06:35.948 --> 01:06:37.950
Leave us alone!

1440
01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.865
Oh. I'm about to
leave you more alone

1441
01:06:39.908 --> 01:06:43.042
than you've ever been
in your miserable little life.

1442
01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:45.566
Taz may have turned
into a big softie.

1443
01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:48.439
but there's one thing about him
that hasn't changed.

1444
01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:50.789
His love of music!

1445
01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:54.532
Not this time. Rocky!

1446
01:06:55.881 --> 01:06:56.708
[gasps]

1447
01:06:58.797 --> 01:07:00.277
That's all right.

1448
01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.975
Every good musician
knows how to improvise.

1449
01:07:03.584 --> 01:07:06.544
[warbles]

1450
01:07:06.587 --> 01:07:09.155
Any last words?
I know you'll keep them short.

1451
01:07:09.199 --> 01:07:10.809
You don't know any long ones.

1452
01:07:10.852 --> 01:07:13.725
Something memorable
like. "That's all. folks!"

1453
01:07:13.768 --> 01:07:15.944
Or. "Suffering succotash!"

1454
01:07:15.988 --> 01:07:18.425
Well. what do you
have to say for yourself?

1455
01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:21.950
[burps]

1456
01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:25.215
-[belching and vomiting]
-[Rocky screaming]

1457
01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:28.087
Oh! It's horrible!

1458
01:07:29.654 --> 01:07:31.221
Don't look. Dad.

1459
01:07:31.264 --> 01:07:32.918
Close your eyes.

1460
01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:37.270
[sputtering]

1461
01:07:38.924 --> 01:07:39.838
[groans]

1462
01:07:40.491 --> 01:07:41.405
Hmm?

1463
01:07:43.798 --> 01:07:46.888
[screaming]

1464
01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:52.459
What wrong with him?

1465
01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:54.287
Taz!

1466
01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:56.594
Are you okay?

1467
01:07:56.637 --> 01:07:58.900
Me think so. What happen?

1468
01:07:58.944 --> 01:08:01.077
I think you lost your lunch.

1469
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.601
I think you lost
a lot of lunches.

1470
01:08:03.644 --> 01:08:06.082
And you've had
some weird lunches.

1471
01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:10.347
Oh. You can open your eyes now.

1472
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:11.913
Oh. my eyes are closed?

1473
01:08:11.957 --> 01:08:14.481
Why can I still see it?

1474
01:08:14.525 --> 01:08:16.831
Okay. it not that bad.

1475
01:08:16.875 --> 01:08:18.572
This never happen.

1476
01:08:18.616 --> 01:08:19.834
Me promise!

1477
01:08:19.878 --> 01:08:22.054
Well. you look a lot better.

1478
01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:25.231
Hey. Yeah. Feel good.

1479
01:08:25.274 --> 01:08:30.541
[warbling]

1480
01:08:37.591 --> 01:08:41.465
So. if it wasn't your fall.
or your age.

1481
01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:42.814
nor your head...

1482
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:45.164
what was it?

1483
01:08:45.208 --> 01:08:46.773
What was
the last thing you ate?

1484
01:08:46.818 --> 01:08:48.124
Quinn make veggie booger.

1485
01:08:49.515 --> 01:08:51.039
Oh. really?

1486
01:08:51.083 --> 01:08:53.477
[laughing nervously]

1487
01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.915
Hey. maybe it veggie booger.

1488
01:08:56.958 --> 01:08:58.438
It doesn't matter.

1489
01:08:58.482 --> 01:09:00.961
Maybe you very bad
at make food.

1490
01:09:01.005 --> 01:09:02.138
Okay.

1491
01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:04.531
You make Tasmanian Devil sick.

1492
01:09:04.575 --> 01:09:06.142
He never sick!

1493
01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:09.406
Me eat entire whale
and that during heat wave.

1494
01:09:09.449 --> 01:09:11.495
Okay! Okay!

1495
01:09:11.538 --> 01:09:14.585
I guess I need help
with some stuff.

1496
01:09:14.628 --> 01:09:16.761
But don't worry.
My dad will make the burgers

1497
01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:18.327
when we pay you
for helping us.

1498
01:09:18.371 --> 01:09:20.068
That not why me help.

1499
01:09:20.112 --> 01:09:20.939
It's not?

1500
01:09:22.201 --> 01:09:23.810
Me help for friend.

1501
01:09:24.682 --> 01:09:26.858
Aw! Taz!

1502
01:09:27.946 --> 01:09:29.861
But me will have veggie booger

1503
01:09:29.904 --> 01:09:31.558
if you making them.

1504
01:09:31.602 --> 01:09:33.081
I'll tell you what. Taz.

1505
01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:35.648
I'll make as many
veggie burgers as you want.

1506
01:09:35.693 --> 01:09:37.173
Yeah? Yeah. [smacks lips]

1507
01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:42.482
We still need to figure out
how to get this thing home.

1508
01:09:42.526 --> 01:09:43.657
I just want to get out of here

1509
01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:45.572
before anything else happens--

1510
01:09:45.616 --> 01:09:47.226
[screams]

1511
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:48.706
[gasps and pants]

1512
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:50.403
-[Quinn] Ned?
-[panting]

1513
01:09:50.447 --> 01:09:53.189
[panting] Came to help...
find your dad.

1514
01:09:53.232 --> 01:09:54.320
[breathing heavily]

1515
01:09:54.364 --> 01:09:56.670
Oh! Hang on.
I got a cramp.

1516
01:09:56.714 --> 01:09:58.759
Oh. what's this for?

1517
01:09:58.803 --> 01:10:01.414
You helped me find my dad.

1518
01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:02.763
Oh. I did?

1519
01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:03.851
Hey. Ned!

1520
01:10:03.895 --> 01:10:06.463
Hey. there he is! [cackling]

1521
01:10:06.505 --> 01:10:09.901
All right.
I did it! Bring it in!

1522
01:10:09.943 --> 01:10:11.250
Mmm!

1523
01:10:11.294 --> 01:10:14.210
[gasps] Is that
the Tasmanian Devil?

1524
01:10:14.253 --> 01:10:15.210
-[Quinn] Uh-huh.
-[Taz] Mmm.

1525
01:10:15.254 --> 01:10:17.213
Oh. is he going to eat us?

1526
01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:18.126
[Taz and Quinn] Uh-uh.

1527
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:20.172
Great! Oh! Let's go home.

1528
01:10:21.085 --> 01:10:21.956
All aboard!

1529
01:10:25.873 --> 01:10:28.267
So. whatever happened
to. Rocky?

1530
01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:31.705
Well. I guess he's just not
as tough as he used to be.

1531
01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:39.670
[warbling]

1532
01:10:39.713 --> 01:10:41.802
Veggie Booger! [warbles]

1533
01:10:41.846 --> 01:10:43.195
And they tied us up

1534
01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:45.458
and made us listen
to terrible music.

1535
01:10:45.502 --> 01:10:47.504
Suddenly. the mountain
began to shake

1536
01:10:47.547 --> 01:10:48.940
and before we knew
what was happening

1537
01:10:48.983 --> 01:10:50.942
the boulders rolled towards us!

1538
01:10:50.985 --> 01:10:52.639
Whoa! Then what happened?

1539
01:10:52.683 --> 01:10:53.814
Shh! Let her tell it!

1540
01:10:53.858 --> 01:10:54.684
[Stan] I was!

1541
01:10:56.513 --> 01:10:59.385
Sorry guys.
To be continued!

1542
01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:00.517
[bandicoot kids] Aw! Crikey!

1543
01:11:00.559 --> 01:11:01.866
We gotta hear what happens!

1544
01:11:01.909 --> 01:11:03.171
Well. what happened
to your story?

1545
01:11:03.215 --> 01:11:04.651
It was just getting good.

1546
01:11:04.695 --> 01:11:06.305
Didn't you want to teach me
how to grill?

1547
01:11:06.349 --> 01:11:07.959
You said it might
help me one day.

1548
01:11:08.002 --> 01:11:09.656
Ah! I love cooking!

1549
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.092
You know.
it saved my life once.

1550
01:11:11.136 --> 01:11:13.398
But. it also
got me abducted by dingoes

1551
01:11:13.443 --> 01:11:15.575
and dropped off a waterfall.

1552
01:11:15.619 --> 01:11:17.664
[chuckles] That's just
how love is!

1553
01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:19.492
That doesn't make
a lot of sense.

1554
01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:21.712
No. no. I guess not.

1555
01:11:21.755 --> 01:11:24.323
That's why I'm the cook
and you're the storyteller.

1556
01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:26.369
We don't have to
love the same things.

1557
01:11:26.412 --> 01:11:28.893
Well. no. but it's still nice

1558
01:11:28.936 --> 01:11:30.808
to share them
sometimes with you.

1559
01:11:30.851 --> 01:11:33.593
[suspenseful music plays]

1560
01:11:34.638 --> 01:11:35.943
Hey. not bad.

1561
01:11:35.987 --> 01:11:38.380
Maybe I'll try telling
a story tonight.

1562
01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:42.385
I think someone
already has the stage.

1563
01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:44.909
And then me get attacked
by eagle.

1564
01:11:44.952 --> 01:11:48.041
Big eagle!
But me fight back like this.

1565
01:11:48.085 --> 01:11:49.609
[warbles]

1566
01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:50.827
[all gasp]

1567
01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:54.484
[warbling continues]

1568
01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:56.268
Then me fall into tree.

1569
01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:57.661
Then me fall out of tree.

1570
01:11:57.704 --> 01:11:59.402
Wow! Then what happened?

1571
01:11:59.445 --> 01:12:00.968
Then the dinosaur came!

1572
01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:03.231
Yeah. Yeah. that's true!

1573
01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:05.669
Big dinosaur.
me fight him. too.

1574
01:12:05.712 --> 01:12:07.452
Oh! But then
a ghost came to help you.

1575
01:12:07.496 --> 01:12:08.498
-Yeah.
-Ghost.

1576
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:10.891
The ghost had flame powers.

1577
01:12:10.934 --> 01:12:13.416
Me and Ghost
fight Dinosaur.

1578
01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:18.072
First he went... [warbles]
and then I did [warbles] .

1579
01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:20.423
And then I showed up too.

1580
01:12:20.466 --> 01:12:22.425
You? I don't know.

1581
01:12:22.468 --> 01:12:24.775
I don't think the Tasmanian
climate is warm enough

1582
01:12:24.818 --> 01:12:27.386
to regulate
the body temperature
of a crocodile.

1583
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:29.388
-That doesn't seem realistic.
-Mmm-mmm.

1584
01:12:31.129 --> 01:12:33.827
Who cares?
It's a good story.

1585
01:12:35.046 --> 01:12:37.309
-[all clamoring]
-Thanks. Quinn.

1586
01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:40.268
You are going to write
a great book someday.

1587
01:12:40.312 --> 01:12:41.791
Maybe.

1588
01:12:41.835 --> 01:12:44.708
I think I need to have
more adventures first.

1589
01:12:44.751 --> 01:12:46.273
How far do you think it is

1590
01:12:46.318 --> 01:12:47.754
to Antarctica?

1591
01:12:47.798 --> 01:12:50.496
Okay. then
the Tasmanian Devil and Quinn

1592
01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:53.281
fight the crocodile
and the ghost.

1593
01:12:53.325 --> 01:12:55.675
Hang on. I want to play.

1594
01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:57.503
