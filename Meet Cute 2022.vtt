- No--good.
I'm--I've got something.

30
00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:14.009
- I wasn't talking
about the drink.

[upbeat music playing]

32
00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.139
- What? [laughs]
No. What?

33
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.557
- You've been
staring at the guy

34
00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:22.767
like you've been waiting
to meet him your whole life.

35
00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.602
Go say hello.

36
00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:25.478
Buy him a drink.

37
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.023
- No. not me. uh-uh. No.

38
00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:30.442
No. thank you. [laughs]

39
00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.819
Actually. okay.

40
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.529
Okay.

41
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.867
Thirsty?

42
00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:40.368
- Hmm?

43
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.746
- Uh. for a drink.
Not--not sexually.

44
00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.497
Gross.
I didn't mean it like that.

45
00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.957
I'm gonna order
an alcoholic beverage.

46
00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.001
Would you like to have one.
too. with--with me?

47
00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:49.502
- Uh. sure. Why not?

- Yeah.

both: Old fashioned.

[both laughing]
- How adorable.

54
00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.853
It's a real cute vibe
going on here.

55
00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.939
- Okay. two old fashioneds.
and you can cut that out. Phil.

56
00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.775
Hi. I'm Sheila.
- Hi.

57
00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:13.860
- Hi.
- I'm. uh--I'm Gary.

58
00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:15.320
- Oh. Gary.

59
00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.572
Wow. so we both have.
like. old-timey names.

60
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:21.368
- Yeah. and I guess
very sadistic parents.

61
00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.702
- Oh. don't even
get me started.

62
00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.579
I mean.
there's no couch in here.

63
00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.456
[laughs]

64
00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.083
But yeah. Gary's--
that's a good name.

65
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.292
That's. like. a strong name.

66
00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:30.669
- Yeah. I guess.
if you're. like.

67
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.505
a used car salesman
or something.

68
00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.131
- Oh. wait. you're not a--

69
00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:36.883
- A--a used car salesman?

70
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.051
- Or a mechanic?

71
00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.261
- No. no. No. Sorry.

72
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:41.930
- Really needed
to get my car fixed.

73
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.265
so I should probably go.

74
00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:45.684
- Oh...

75
00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.560
- I'm totally kidding.
- Okay.

76
00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.562
- [laughs]
- Okay.

77
00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.315
- Ah! Oh. yay!
- Yeah.

78
00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.025
Thanks. Phil.

79
00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.610
both: Cheers. mate!

80
00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:59.280
- That was kinda weird.

81
00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.658
- [chuckles] Well. not really.

82
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.159
- I mean. what are the odds?

83
00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:04.285
- Odds are pretty good.
actually.

84
00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.371
Gary. I gotta come clean
with you.

85
00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.498
I'm a time traveler
from the future.

86
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.709
So I knew everything
you were gonna say.

87
00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.671
- Right. Okay.
- [laughing]

88
00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.423
- Okay.
- Yeah.

89
00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:20.260
- [clears throat]
So what is the future like?

90
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:21.594
- Kind of what you'd expect.
you know.

91
00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:23.847
Robots hunting down
inferior robots

92
00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.599
while the humans just watch
and do nothing.

93
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.310
- So kind of like
"Blade Runner"?

94
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.645
- No. that's a work of fiction.
Gary.

95
00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.147
This is reality
I'm talking about.

96
00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:33.606
- Yeah. Sorry.

97
00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:34.774
Yeah. you're right.
- [laughing]

98
00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.069
- Uh. well. excuse me.
but it sounds like

99
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.739
things are pretty rough
for robots in the future.

100
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.407
- Yes. It's a real injustice.

101
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.867
But you know.
I wouldn't worry about it.

102
00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.702
They actually started their own
civil rights movement.

103
00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.078
- Wow.
- It's making headway.

104
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.496
I can't talk about it.

105
00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.623
Plus. I don't wanna fuck up
your timeline.

106
00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:51.958
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

107
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.376
- Because I like my timeline.
- Yeah.

108
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.919
No. totally.
- You know. So. um--

109
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.629
- Mm-hmm. [laughs]

110
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.715
You know. all this time travel

111
00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:01.843
really makes a girl
super hungry.

112
00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:02.969
- Wow.

113
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.598
That's--that's
super interesting.

114
00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.849
- So I'm gonna get some food.

115
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:12.145
Would you like to come with me
and get food?

116
00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.438
- Food. Yeah.

117
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.398
Let's--let's--
let's go get you some food.

118
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.358
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

119
00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.317
- Okay.
- All right.

120
00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:20.153
- Okay. Bye. Phil.

121
00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:23.031

* *

123
00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.995
I noticed you weren't really
watching the game in there.

124
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.872
So what do you have
against televised sports?

125
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:33.124
Did. like. a football kill
your grandpa or something?

126
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.918
- Yeah. actually. it did.

127
00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.002
Love you. Grandpa.

128
00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.504
- [laughs]
- No.

129
00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.923
I didn't really grow up
in a sports-friendly household.

130
00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:41.716
You know.
my dad was never home.

131
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.010
He was. like.
a traveling professor.

132
00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.680
And yeah. we never played catch
or anything like that.

133
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.807
So I just. like. stayed inside
and watched movies.

134
00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:52.310
And you know.
before I knew it. he was dead.

135
00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.354
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

136
00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.564
What are you gonna do?
You know?

137
00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.608
- My dad's dead too.

138
00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:01.695
- Oh.

139
00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.988
- [laughing]
I don't know why...

140
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.992
Uh. he was a--also a traveling
alcoholic. more so.

141
00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.703
Traveled from bar to bar.
you know?

142
00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.372
And then eventually
it just--it killed him.

143
00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.207
- I'm sorry.

144
00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:15.417
- That's okay.

145
00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.586
- Well. clearly. it didn't fuck
either one of us up.

146
00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.089
- No. Very normal people.
- Yeah.

147
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.424
We're so normal.
- Mm-hmm.

148
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.384
- Nothing wrong with us at all.
- No.

149
00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:25.552
I mean.
other than the fact that

150
00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.178
I'm about to ruin your life.
- Yeah?

151
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.139
I had a feeling.

152
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.099
- Ladies. come drink for free!

153
00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:34.102
[indistinct chatter]

154
00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.770
- Okay. We're here.

155
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.981
What should we choose?

156
00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:40.316
- Well. it's a real
"Sophie's Choice"

157
00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.318
kind of decision now. isn't it?

158
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.112
- I love it
when you make that joke.

159
00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.238
- What?
- What?

160
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.656
- Best vindaloo in town!

161
00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:47.782
Eight stars on the Yelp.

162
00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:48.825
- Eight stars on Yelp!

163
00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:50.118
We have to go to that one.

164
00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.871
- Mr. Jeff Medolla

165
00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.330
from "The Bachelorette"
eat here.

166
00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.582
- Oh.
- Yes.

167
00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:57.625
- Are you playing peekaboo
or something?

168
00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.753
- No. just looking at the menu.
- Okay.

169
00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.379
Well. I would like to see
your face as soon as possible.

170
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.048
- Really?
- If that's possible. yeah.

171
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.007
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:05.550
I wanna see your face.
- Okay.

173
00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.427
Let's just order so we can get
the business out of the way.

174
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.929
you know. and get to pleasure.
from one OCD person to another.

175
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.222
You understand that. right?
I'll be right back.

176
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.307
- Yeah. for sure.

It was called Nail Me Good.

246

they deserved my money.

the bathroom.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.360
Do you have a restroom here?

It's not a tanning machine.

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:46.933
Um. what do you recommend?

352
00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.436
- We've got a flavor
called Childhood.

353
00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:53.606
It's ice cream made out of milk
left to soak for two weeks

354
00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:55.108
in Fruity Pebbles cereal

355
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.402
served on a cone
made out of deconstructed

356
00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:00.655
peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

357
00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:04.909
- Um. do you have vanilla?

358
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.745
- No.

359
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:09.456

361
00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:14.461
- You know. it really does
taste like my childhood.

362
00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:15.628
- I know. Mine too.

363
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.671
It's amazing.

364
00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:20.050

365
00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:21.760
[laughs]
- What?

366
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.345
- You're just like
a little baby.

367
00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:26.723
It's all over your face.
- Shut up!

368
00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:28.892
- I grew up in that apartment
building right there.

369
00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.393
Literally right there.
- Right there?

370
00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:31.478
- Uh-huh.
- No way.

371
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.855
- Yep. 600. Apartment 1K.

372
00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:35.815
- That's crazy.
What was that like?

373
00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.984
- Um. the city
was kind of different.

374
00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.486
It was--it was fine.

375
00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:42.364
but. well. it was a little bit
lonely. you know.

376
00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:47.452
I'm having
a very strange feeling.

377
00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:51.206
like a memory right now.

378
00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.583
This cable guy showed up
at our house.

379
00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.670
I was really little.
but I don't totally remember.

380
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.214
but I do remember

381
00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:02.384
he was so nice to me.

382
00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:05.720

383
00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.014
Is that so weird?

384
00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:11.267
- Yes. That's very weird.
- Yeah? [laughs]

385
00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:12.727
- Yeah.

386
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:13.978
- I was normal.
I had friends.

387
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.605
I didn't. like. murder animals
or anything.

388
00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:16.648
- Okay. well. the fact

389
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.982
that you just
had to clarify that

390
00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.693
means you're fucked up.

391
00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:22.862
[both laughing]

392
00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.657
- So should we keep
this adventure up?

393
00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:26.700
Should we go somewhere else?

394
00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:28.034
- I'd love to.

395
00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:29.703
- Do you like polka music?
- No.

396
00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:30.704
- What?
- Do you?

397
00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:31.746
- Yes.
- Ew!

398
00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.081
- [laughs]

399
00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.791
- You know. I can't tell
which one I like more.

400
00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:36.209
the hoppy one or the wheat.

401
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.752
- Well. you're just gonna
have to keep drinking then.

402
00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:38.878
so you can find out.

403
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.921
- Right. for science.

404
00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:41.256
- Obviously for science. yes.

405
00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:42.799
That's what we're doing.
an experiment.

406
00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:45.010
[polka music playing]

407
00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.928
- Oh. absolutely.

408
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.347
- You know. Gary. I just--I--

409
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.141
I gotta come clean with you
about something.

410
00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:52.892
- I know.
I know you're from the future.

411
00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.144
I get it.
- Yes.

412
00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:55.895
Yes. I am.
- Mm.

413
00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:57.313
- But something else.

414
00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.065
Remember earlier
at the restaurant

415
00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:01.526
when you asked me
what I did with my other self

416
00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.278
when I traveled back
to her timeline?

417
00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.238
And I was like. "Ha. ha. ha.

418
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.240
I didn't even think about that.
Ha. ha. ha."

419
00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:08.450
Do you remember?
- Mm-hmm.

420
00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:09.617
- That was a lie.

421
00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:12.037
- Okay.

422
00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:12.996
- I killed her.

423
00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:14.581
- [spits]

425
00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.584
I wasn't expecting that.

426
00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:18.585
You killed her?

427
00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.086
- I did. yeah.

428
00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:22.213
My car just like. vrrr.
right over her face.

429
00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:23.882
- That'll do it.
- Yeah.

430
00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.592
And then I stuffed her
in my trunk.

431
00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:26.676
- Oh.

432
00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:28.845
Um. congrats on that.

433
00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:30.096
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

434
00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:31.973
You're a murderer.
- [laughs]

435
00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:34.100
- So here's to dead Sheila.

436
00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:35.268
- Yes. Yes.

437
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.062
- I hope she's in
a better place.

438
00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:38.480
- Yes. absolutely.
- Absolutely.

439

- I mean. I'm jealous of her.
to be honest with you.

440

- Absolutely. I mean.
the world is a pretty--

441
00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:43.443
all: Oh!
- Oh. my--fuck.

442
00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:45.403
I'm--I'm so--I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

443
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.738
- Fuck. I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

444

- I'm sorry. Oh. no.
- What are you doing?

445
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.450
- Fuck.
- Are you kidding me?

446
00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:54.704
- Look. it's okay for things
to be messy sometimes.

447
00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.624
Okay?
- It is?

448
00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:58.958
- Yeah.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.627

450
00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:02.587
you still wanna stay
on the date?

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:50.010
- I really like
that sentence you said before.

463
00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:52.762
The one about things
being messy.

464
00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:53.888
- Yeah. me too.

465
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.348
Someone said that to me
a long time ago.

466
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.808
and it really stuck.

467
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.144
Like. it released me from
some sort of mental prison.

468
00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.187
you know?
- Yeah. exactly.

469
00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:02.480
That's exactly how I feel.

470
00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:03.523
- Yeah.

471
00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:06.026
What a night.
- Yeah.

472
00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.153
Was it worth
all the time travel?

473
00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:09.195
- Oh. absolutely.

474
00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:10.613

[laughs]

476
00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.617
- You know. I could probably
do this forever.

477
00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:17.579
but it is getting
a little late.

478
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.206
So I'd really love
to do this again sometime.

479
00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:21.750
- Me too.
I'll see you tomorrow.

480
00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.376
- [laughs] What?

481
00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.880
- You know. when I travel back
24 hours again.

482
00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:29.132
- What do you mean again?

483
00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.217
- Oh. I gotta come clean
with you. Gary.

484
00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:32.594
This is not our first rodeo.

485
00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.554
[laughs]
- What are you talking about?

486
00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.556
- Yeah. I've spent
the entire week with you.

487
00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.808
This night.
seven times in a row.

488
00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:41.936
- Okay. wait.
So you weren't kidding?

489
00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.646
- No. not kidding.

490
00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:45.648
Very serious.

491
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.610
- Okay. let's just pretend
for a second

492
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.737
that I believe your whole
future time travel bullshit--

493
00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.530
because I don't.
because it's bonkers.

494
00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.032
but let's just pretend
that I do.

495
00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:56.326
Why would you travel back
to the same time

496
00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:57.911
over and over again?

497
00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.329
Why? So you could get it right?

498
00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.581
Or to try and. like.
win me over or. like--

499
00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:02.582
- No.
- What are you doing?

500
00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:03.875
- No. that would be super weird

501
00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:04.876
and creepy and obsessive.

502
00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:05.877
No. that's the whole point.

503
00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.420
I don't have to be perfect.

504
00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:09.255
All this magic you're feeling.
I felt it. too.

505
00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.882
from night one
and every night after that.

506
00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.759
And no matter which way
I came at you--

507
00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:15.679
awkward. funny. silly. sad--
you played it all perfectly.

508
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.098
And by the end of the night.
we were always on cloud nine.

509
00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.265
That's the thing.
I don't have to try.

510
00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.433
We just work.

511
00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:21.393
Have you ever had
a night like this.

512
00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.353
ever. in your entire life?

513
00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.106
You haven't. See?

514
00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:28.149
Because you feel the magic too.

515
00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:31.194
You feel it here.
and you feel it here.

516
00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.862
and you feel it here--
- Hey. all right.

517
00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:35.031
Yes. Yes. I feel it there.

518
00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:36.616
- Okay. well...[laughs]

519
00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.284
That's why I have to keep
revisiting this night.

520
00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.661
The perfect night.

521
00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:41.705
- But why would you
wanna revisit

522
00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:44.332
the same thing
over and over again?

523
00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.875
You know. wouldn't you
wanna try something new

524
00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:47.377
and maybe. I don't know.

525
00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:48.878
we go out for. like.
a second date

526
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.798
or see if we have a future.
like. the old-fashioned way.

527
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.633
- No. Gary.
I've already done that. okay?

528
00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.301
It just--it doesn't end well.

529
00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:56.886
Look. tomorrow.
Amber's gonna call you

530
00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:59.139
and tell you she's pregnant
or you're gonna get killed

531
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.598
in a freaky
subway track accident.

532
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.684
It was terrible.
Your body was. like. all--

533
00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:04.352
it was everywhere
and very unsettling.

534
00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:05.979
The entire East Coast's
gonna get nuked.

535
00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:07.397
you know. and we think
it's North Koreans.

536
00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:09.357
but we realize
it's an inside job. so...

537
00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:10.525
- What? What are you--

538
00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:11.901
- Nothing. Gary. it's okay.

539
00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:12.902
Listen. it doesn't matter.

540
00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:14.279
This is just about us.

541
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.321
You have to trust me.

542
00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:18.283
This is the cleaner way.

543
00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:25.123
- Um--I'm. uh...

544
00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.458
I'm really tired.

545
00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.168
Uh. my head hurts.

546
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:32.005
I think I should probably
get going.

547
00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:33.256
- I know.

548
00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.759
- It was nice to meet you.
Sheila.

549
00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.261
- Bye. Gary.

550
00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.055
I'll see you tomorrow.

551
00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:44.642
* *

552
00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.853
- So I've just been listening
to Sports Talk radio.

553
00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:49.856
'cause I don't wanna listen
to real news.

554
00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:52.901
[continues speaking
indistinctly]

555
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:59.908
* *

556
00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:08.917
[brakes screeching]

557
00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:24.516
* *

558
00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:28.061
- Players surging forward
with real menace.

559
00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:29.646
Delivery to Vinnie Fisk!

560
00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:31.481
It's a perfect touch.
He's on the breakaway.

561
00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:33.108
Keeper comes out--

562
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:36.277
[cheers and applause]

563
00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:44.828
- Thirsty?

564
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.496
- Yeah. Yeah. Phil.
I wanna tap that.

565
00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:48.456
Happy?
- Damn.

566
00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.417
You go. girl.

567
00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:51.793
Why don't you go talk to him?

568
00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:55.171
- I am gonna go buy him
a drink.

569
00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:57.090
Nice evening for it. huh?

570
00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:59.092
- Uh. so--for--

571
00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:00.760
uh. for what?
- Exactly.

572
00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:02.262
I'm gonna order
an alcoholic beverage.

573
00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:04.305
Would you like one?

574
00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:06.266
- Uh...[clears throat]
Yeah. Sure.

575
00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:07.809
- Great.
- Yeah.

576
00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:10.270
So I had to develop these.
like. coping mechanisms.

577
00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.813
Nothing like murdering people.
but--

578
00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.399
- Oh. I had
coping mechanisms too.

579
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:15.817
I mean. not the murdering part.

580
00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:18.653
Actually. yeah. I did.
More murdering myself.

581
00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:21.406
I more have. like. these
impulses that I can't control

582
00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:22.949
where things just...

583
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:25.243
* *

584
00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.078
It's very hard
to live that way.

585
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.830
- Yeah. I imagine that
could be quite debilitating.

586
00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:30.790
- Can't control it. yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

587
00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:32.959
- Which one do we choose?
- I don't know.

588
00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:35.628
It's a real "Sophie's Choice"
over here.

589
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.797
- Best chicken korma
on the East Coast.

590
00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:39.632
- Let's go to this one.
- Henry P. Zagat himself raves.

591
00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:42.093
"It's a symphony
for the senses."

592
00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:46.473
Yeah. in 1995
before we moved locations.

593
00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:47.891
- You know in--how the--
"Titanic."

594
00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.976
Jack teaches Rose how to spit?
- Yeah.

595
00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:53.980
- I kinda wanted to do that
with you. but with burping.

596
00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:55.106
I don't know.

597
00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:56.358
You know. a lot
of people actually say

598
00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:58.651
I remind them
of Leonardo DiCaprio.

599
00:21:58.693 --> 00:22:00.153
like in
"What's Eating Gilbert Grape."

600
00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.655
- [laughing]

601
00:22:02.697 --> 00:22:04.240
Yes.
- They say it's uncanny.

602
00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:06.034
- Uncanny.
- Some say.

603
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.704
Wait. so if you're
from the future. can--

604
00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:11.915
you can tell...
both: What I'm gonna say?

605
00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:13.041
- Yeah.

606
00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:15.168
- [laughs]

607
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.336
- Hey. let's order.

608
00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:17.796
You know. because--
- Yeah.

609
00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:19.172
So you can get business
out of the way

610
00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:21.424
so you can focus
on the pleasure.

611
00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:24.427
* *

612
00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:26.388
- Um...

613
00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:28.682
What--yeah.
- What can I get you?

614
00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:30.183
- All the things.
We want all the things.

615
00:22:30.225 --> 00:22:31.601
Let's get everything.

616
00:22:31.643 --> 00:22:33.687
Let's just. like. max out
the credit card. you know?

617
00:22:33.728 --> 00:22:35.855
Yeah. like curry
and chicken kebabs

618
00:22:35.897 --> 00:22:37.607
and saag mushroom
and butter chicken

619
00:22:37.649 --> 00:22:39.526
and chicken makhni tikka.
fish masala.

620
00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:41.361
shrimp biryani
with lamb or beef rezala.

621
00:22:41.403 --> 00:22:43.238
broccoli and chana.
bhindi bhaji.

622
00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.739
chicken pakora. coconut curry.

623
00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:48.326
and. like.
two very large wines.

624
00:22:48.368 --> 00:22:49.828
- Thank you. sir.

625
00:22:51.413 --> 00:22:52.497
- I was very hungry.

626
00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:56.042
- So do you know John Connor?

627
00:22:57.127 --> 00:22:58.211
"The Terminator."

628
00:22:58.253 --> 00:23:01.297
- Mm-hmm.
- He's--he's from the future.

629
00:23:01.339 --> 00:23:05.260
- Oh. I'm actually just
from 24 hours in the future.

630
00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:07.220
- Okay.
- Gary. here's the thing.

631
00:23:07.262 --> 00:23:09.347
Now that we've been seeing
each other for three months.

632
00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:12.058
I just really feel like I
can open up to you. you know?

633
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.768
- Okay. Uh--

634
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:16.062
- Normally I tell you
that I walked into a nail salon

635
00:23:16.104 --> 00:23:18.565
and I just stumbled upon
this time machine

636
00:23:18.606 --> 00:23:20.734
on a very happy.
sunshiny. perfect day.

637
00:23:20.775 --> 00:23:21.901
But that's just
really not the case.

638
00:23:21.943 --> 00:23:23.862
See. on that fateful day
three months ago

639
00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:25.447
when I took my first trip.

640
00:23:25.488 --> 00:23:27.407
I was actually
about to kill myself.

641
00:23:27.449 --> 00:23:30.410
[dramatic music]

642
00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:33.788
* *

643
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.707
Good afternoon. everyone.

644
00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:37.500
I plan on killing myself.
and I'd really like

645
00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:39.210
to go out with some nice nails.

646
00:23:39.252 --> 00:23:41.963
You know. for the fans.

647
00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:44.382
What?

648
00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:45.633
- What color?

649
00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:50.221
- Hmm. something more
that says.

650
00:23:50.263 --> 00:23:52.098
"She lived a classy life."

651
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.267
- Hmm.

652
00:23:54.309 --> 00:23:56.269
- "Elegant death." I like it.

653
00:23:56.311 --> 00:23:57.479
- It's glossy.

654
00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.064
- Great.

655
00:24:00.857 --> 00:24:02.275
- Do you have a bathroom here?

656
00:24:02.317 --> 00:24:04.235
I'd really like to die
on an empty bladder.

657
00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:06.154
- Yeah.

658
00:24:06.196 --> 00:24:07.364
I have a bathroom.

659
00:24:07.405 --> 00:24:09.908
Maybe before you straight up
murder yourself.

660
00:24:09.949 --> 00:24:11.576
go in there.

661
00:24:12.619 --> 00:24:13.578
- What?

662
00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.788
Time travel?

663
00:24:14.829 --> 00:24:16.539
Why? Why would I do that?

664
00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:18.583
Why would I wanna go back
to yesterday?

665
00:24:18.625 --> 00:24:20.126
Yesterday was shit too.

666
00:24:20.168 --> 00:24:21.670
Let me tell you. okay?

667
00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:23.755
I do not wanna fucking do that.

668
00:24:23.797 --> 00:24:25.382
I do not wanna go back there.

669
00:24:25.423 --> 00:24:28.301
That would be a really. really.
really big mistake. you know?

670
00:24:28.343 --> 00:24:30.637
I'm just such a fucking loser.

671
00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:32.263
I'm such a fucking sad sack.

672
00:24:32.305 --> 00:24:33.598
Why are you so nice to me?

673
00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.184
Why are you so nice to me?

674
00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:37.519
- You tip decent.

675
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.270
- I do tip well.

676
00:24:39.312 --> 00:24:41.523
[crying] Just gonna...

677
00:24:41.564 --> 00:24:44.818
I don't wanna ruin my nails.

678
00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:46.861
- Okay.
- Just get it. right?

679
00:24:46.903 --> 00:24:50.532
- Okay. Okay. Look up.

680
00:24:52.242 --> 00:24:53.535
- Time travel.

681
00:24:53.576 --> 00:24:54.744
Tomorrow. yesterday.
it doesn't matter.

682
00:24:54.786 --> 00:24:56.746
That's the problem.
That is the problem.

683
00:24:56.788 --> 00:25:00.000
No matter what.
my life is shit. okay?

684
00:25:00.041 --> 00:25:04.337
- This is a second chance.
and those are rare.

685
00:25:04.379 --> 00:25:06.339
So maybe you should take it.

686
00:25:06.381 --> 00:25:09.092
You might see things
differently on the other side.

687
00:25:09.134 --> 00:25:10.802
And if you don't.

688
00:25:10.844 --> 00:25:13.638
you can always
kill yourself later.

689
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.306
- Yeah. I'll do it. Fuck it.

690
00:25:15.348 --> 00:25:18.184
Maybe I'll get shit out on
the other side of the rainbow.

691
00:25:18.226 --> 00:25:20.520
- That's the spirit.

692
00:25:20.562 --> 00:25:22.272
[whirring]

693
00:25:24.232 --> 00:25:25.525
- And here I am.

694
00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:27.235
24 hours in the past.

695
00:25:29.946 --> 00:25:32.365
- Well. how do you feel now?

696
00:25:32.407 --> 00:25:34.409
- Much better.

697
00:25:34.451 --> 00:25:37.412
- You just kind of got shit out
the other side of the rainbow?

698
00:25:37.454 --> 00:25:40.498
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

699
00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:43.793
- I've been shit out
the other side a couple times.

700
00:25:43.835 --> 00:25:45.628
- [laughs]
- It's okay.

701
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.088
Nothing to be ashamed of.

702
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.840
- Hmm.

703
00:25:48.882 --> 00:25:52.469
In fact. this is the first time
I've been this happy

704
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.014
in a very. very.
very long time.

705
00:25:56.056 --> 00:26:00.602
- Well. it makes me
really happy.

706
00:26:00.643 --> 00:26:03.897
I'm very. very glad
to hear that.

707
00:26:05.565 --> 00:26:07.776
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

710
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.118
- Good night. Amit.

712
00:26:30.131 --> 00:26:32.550
Do you think I'm a passenger
on the crazy train?

713
00:26:32.592 --> 00:26:33.968
- No. No. I don't.

714
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.179
- You think I'm the conductor
of the crazy train?

715
00:26:36.221 --> 00:26:37.430
I should not have said
any of that.

716
00:26:37.472 --> 00:26:38.598
That was TMI.

717
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.683
I don't know
what I was thinking.

718
00:26:39.724 --> 00:26:40.600
I shouldn't have said that
to you.

719
00:26:40.642 --> 00:26:42.519
- Hey. Hey. Hey. relax.

720
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.645
I don't think that.

721
00:26:43.687 --> 00:26:45.772
I really don't. at all.

722
00:26:45.814 --> 00:26:48.274
And even if I do. who cares?

723
00:26:48.316 --> 00:26:49.609
My life's been so boring.

724
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:52.153
I can get on this ride.

725
00:26:52.195 --> 00:26:53.363
- Hmm.

726
00:26:53.405 --> 00:26:55.490
Well. then. all aboard. baby.
- All right.

727
00:26:55.532 --> 00:26:57.450
Well. just don't drive us
off a cliff. all right?

728
00:26:57.492 --> 00:26:58.660
- Oh. I would never.

729
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:04.791
[gasps] Let's shop.

730
00:27:04.833 --> 00:27:06.376
- For dirty clothes?

731
00:27:06.418 --> 00:27:09.462
- [laughs] They're not dirty.

732
00:27:09.504 --> 00:27:11.840
Look how cute.

733
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:13.717
- This one has gum on it.
- Oh. my God.

734
00:27:13.758 --> 00:27:16.219
[laughs] Gary.
- What?

735
00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:18.555
- An old-timey shirt
with your old-timey name.

736
00:27:18.596 --> 00:27:19.931
You have to get this.
- No.

737
00:27:19.973 --> 00:27:20.974
- Yes.
I'm getting it for you.

738
00:27:21.016 --> 00:27:22.100
- Absolutely not.
- You have to.

739
00:27:22.142 --> 00:27:23.268
- No.
- You have to.

740
00:27:23.309 --> 00:27:26.604
- Fine. but only
if I can get you this.

741
00:27:26.646 --> 00:27:28.231
- Okay. I'll get that.

742
00:27:28.273 --> 00:27:29.482
- Okay.

743
00:27:29.524 --> 00:27:30.817
- Thank you.

744
00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:32.152
It'll look very cute on you.

745
00:27:32.193 --> 00:27:33.361
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

746
00:27:33.403 --> 00:27:35.697
- Can't wait to wear
some random guy's shirt.

747
00:27:35.739 --> 00:27:37.115
- [laughs]

748
00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:42.287
Isn't it pretty tonight?
- Yes.

749
00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:43.621
- You look very good
in your new shirt. by the way.

750
00:27:43.663 --> 00:27:45.331
- Oh. thank you. Mm.

751
00:27:45.373 --> 00:27:48.835
- [laughing]

752
00:27:48.877 --> 00:27:51.171
Oh. by the way.
right there is exactly--

753
00:27:51.212 --> 00:27:53.965
- Is that where you grew up
or something?

754
00:27:54.007 --> 00:27:56.343
- What?
- Oh. I'm sorry.

755
00:27:56.384 --> 00:27:58.678
I thought. uh--for some reason
I thought maybe

756
00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.888
you might have mentioned...

757
00:27:59.929 --> 00:28:02.682
- Yeah. no. Yes. Um.

758
00:28:02.724 --> 00:28:06.394
[laughs] 600. Apartment 1K.

759
00:28:06.436 --> 00:28:08.021
- Okay.

760
00:28:08.063 --> 00:28:09.689
- My entire childhood.

761
00:28:09.731 --> 00:28:10.690
Yeah.
- That's crazy.

762
00:28:10.732 --> 00:28:12.025
What was that like?

763
00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:14.361
- Uh. you know. the city
was very different then.

764
00:28:14.402 --> 00:28:16.154
but it was kinda lonely.

765
00:28:16.196 --> 00:28:18.907
My mom kinda gave up
pretty early.

766
00:28:22.744 --> 00:28:24.329
[chuckles]
- What?

767
00:28:24.371 --> 00:28:27.207
- Um. there was
this. like. cable guy

768
00:28:27.248 --> 00:28:29.626
who stopped by one afternoon.

769
00:28:29.668 --> 00:28:31.711
I was really little.
so I don't really remember.

770
00:28:31.753 --> 00:28:34.923
but he was very nice to me.

771
00:28:34.964 --> 00:28:37.759
I don't know why
I just told you that.

772
00:28:37.801 --> 00:28:39.010
It's weird.
- It is a little weird.

773
00:28:39.052 --> 00:28:39.969
- Yeah.
- It's okay.

774
00:28:40.011 --> 00:28:40.970
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

775
00:28:41.012 --> 00:28:42.722
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

776
00:28:42.764 --> 00:28:44.391
- Come here.
Wanna take a picture?

777
00:28:44.432 --> 00:28:45.850
- Obviously.
- Let's take a selfie.

778
00:28:45.892 --> 00:28:47.560
- Yeah. Let me take it.
I have really long arms.

779
00:28:47.602 --> 00:28:48.645
- No. no. no. no.

780
00:28:48.687 --> 00:28:50.021
Oh. Oops.
- Oh. fuck! Fuck.

781
00:28:50.063 --> 00:28:51.773
- No. it's fine.
- Oh. no.

782
00:28:51.815 --> 00:28:53.108
I'm sorry.
- It's not a big deal.

783
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:54.943
- No. I'm sorry. I think--
- It's just my phone.

784
00:28:54.984 --> 00:28:56.319
- I think I can fix it.
- Gary.

785
00:28:56.361 --> 00:28:57.821
- I fucked up. I'm sorry.
- Gary!

786
00:28:57.862 --> 00:28:58.988
- I'm sorry--yeah--
- Gary!

787
00:29:03.118 --> 00:29:05.578
It's okay for things
to be messy sometimes.

Oh. what a night.

791
00:29:22.429 --> 00:29:23.930
- Yeah. it was worth
all the time travel?

792
00:29:23.972 --> 00:29:25.390
- Oh. yeah.

793
00:29:25.432 --> 00:29:28.101
Henry Zagat says it's
a symphony for all the senses.

794
00:29:28.143 --> 00:29:29.936
- Zagat?
- Yeah.

795
00:29:29.978 --> 00:29:30.937
- "Zuh-gat"?
- I think so.

796
00:29:30.979 --> 00:29:32.230
- I thought it was "za-get."

797
00:29:32.272 --> 00:29:34.774
I've been saying "za-get."
- [laughs]

798
00:29:34.816 --> 00:29:36.526
I don't think so.

799
00:29:36.568 --> 00:29:38.028
Maybe I'm wrong.

800
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.118
[siren wailing]

801
00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:48.955
So actually. this was the spot
I was gonna kill myself.

00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:50.290
Can you believe it?

803
00:29:52.375 --> 00:29:53.793
- Wait. Really?

804
00:29:53.835 --> 00:29:54.961
- I know.

805
00:29:55.003 --> 00:29:55.962
Think about it.

806
00:29:56.004 --> 00:29:57.630
The drop. the dive.

807
00:29:57.672 --> 00:29:58.882
the chill of the water.

808
00:29:58.923 --> 00:30:01.468
I mean. it's a pretty good way
to go.

809
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:03.970
Plus. no blood.
and no. like. weird forensics.

810
00:30:04.012 --> 00:30:04.971
Like. what happened to her?

811
00:30:05.013 --> 00:30:06.598
It'd be very obvious.

812
00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:08.892
Pretty selfless way to kill
yourself. don't you think?

813
00:30:08.933 --> 00:30:10.060
I feel like people
would call me

814
00:30:10.101 --> 00:30:12.312
the Mother Teresa of suicides.

815
00:30:12.354 --> 00:30:14.606
Maybe not.
but I don't mind if they do.

816
00:30:18.193 --> 00:30:21.946
- I mean.
at the end of the day. it's--

817
00:30:21.988 --> 00:30:23.823
deep down. it's...

818
00:30:23.865 --> 00:30:25.992
it's all jokes. right?

819
00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:28.703
- Uh. no. Not all of them.

820
00:30:28.745 --> 00:30:30.288
But I'm okay now.

821
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.207
- I'm sorry. I wish I could--

822
00:30:32.248 --> 00:30:34.668
- I've been waiting for you
my whole life. Gary.

823
00:30:34.709 --> 00:30:37.671
- Oh. Um--all right.

824
00:30:37.712 --> 00:30:40.173
Well. don't you think
it's a little early for that?

825
00:30:40.215 --> 00:30:43.134
- It's been five months. Gary.

826
00:30:43.176 --> 00:30:45.512
- Oh--we met today.

827
00:30:45.553 --> 00:30:47.597
We met literally today.

828
00:30:47.639 --> 00:30:50.433
- You're the first person
to make me truly happy ever.

829
00:30:50.475 --> 00:30:51.434
You're the man I've been

looking over
men's shoulders for.

00:30:52.811 --> 00:30:54.020
It's you this whole time.

832
00:30:54.062 --> 00:30:55.939
I've been waiting
my whole life for you.

833
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.899
You're finally here.

834
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.028
- Uh...

835
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.615
I think we should take
a breath.

836
00:31:05.657 --> 00:31:08.535
And I'm gonna go.

837
00:31:08.576 --> 00:31:10.578
Is that okay?
Is it okay if I go?

838
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.163
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

839
00:31:12.205 --> 00:31:13.581
- You're not gonna do
anything dumb. right?

840
00:31:13.623 --> 00:31:14.791
- Mm-mm.

841
00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:15.917
- You're sure you're okay?

842
00:31:15.959 --> 00:31:18.378
- Mm-hmm.

843
00:31:24.175 --> 00:31:25.885
I'll see you tomorrow. Gary.

Oh. what a night.

This was the spot
I was gonna kill myself.

00:31:34.102 --> 00:31:35.645
Can you believe it?

00:31:39.482 --> 00:31:40.734
- I'm sorry. I--

00:31:40.775 --> 00:31:42.235
- Gary. I've been waiting
for you my whole life.

852
00:31:42.277 --> 00:31:43.903
- Oh.
- Hmm.

853
00:31:43.945 --> 00:31:47.574

[whirring]

858
00:31:52.829 --> 00:31:53.913
You're the person I've been

looking over
men's shoulders for.

You're the one
I've been waiting for.

861
00:31:56.624 --> 00:31:58.251
and you're finally here.

862
00:31:58.293 --> 00:31:59.586
Think about it:
the fall. the plunge.

863
00:31:59.627 --> 00:32:02.380
the dive and the chill.
the water.

864
00:32:02.422 --> 00:32:04.090
Very good spot for it.
And no blood.

865
00:32:04.132 --> 00:32:05.925
You are the person
that I have been waiting for

866
00:32:05.967 --> 00:32:07.886
my entire life.

867
00:32:07.927 --> 00:32:11.431
- Is it okay if I go?

868
00:32:11.473 --> 00:32:13.516
Maybe talk about this
some other time.

869
00:32:13.558 --> 00:32:15.643
Don't you think it's a little
too soon to talk like that?

870
00:32:15.685 --> 00:32:17.145
- You're not even gonna
remember this

871
00:32:17.187 --> 00:32:19.939
and it just makes me
so. so sad. Gary. you know?

872
00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:21.191
- Tomorrow can't be that bad.

873
00:32:21.232 --> 00:32:22.400
- Of course it can.

874
00:32:22.442 --> 00:32:24.110
I have to keep revisiting it.

875
00:32:24.152 --> 00:32:25.487
The perfect night.

876
00:32:25.528 --> 00:32:27.155
You do it every time.
Just fucking walk away.

1053
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.331
Stosch makes a sloppy tackle.

1054
00:39:33.373 --> 00:39:34.749
- Fuck.

1055
00:39:34.791 --> 00:39:35.792
- And the referee's
giving him the penalty.

1056
00:39:35.834 --> 00:39:37.293
- It's a bullshit call.

1057
00:39:37.335 --> 00:39:39.004
- It's amazing as it looked
like a 50-50 ball--

1058
00:39:39.045 --> 00:39:42.215
- Phil. do you see
new Gary over there?

1059
00:39:42.257 --> 00:39:43.508
Look at him.

1060
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:45.260
- Lining up
for the penalty now.

1061
00:39:45.301 --> 00:39:46.636
- What do you think?

1062
00:39:46.678 --> 00:39:49.055
Does he look different
to you. or...?

1063
00:39:49.097 --> 00:39:50.098
Oh. yeah.

1064
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.017
Something is different.

1065
00:39:52.058 --> 00:39:54.019
Really liking what
I'm seeing. Phil.

1066
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.478
Really liking it.

1067
00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.939
* Hmm. hmm. hmm *

1068
00:39:57.981 --> 00:39:59.566
- These two teammates
practically all

1069
00:39:59.607 --> 00:40:02.027
on the same page.
FC...

1070
00:40:02.068 --> 00:40:04.487
- Hello?
- Hi.

1071
00:40:04.529 --> 00:40:06.698
Are the good guys winning.
or...?

1072
00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.408
- The good guys?
- Mm-hmm.

1073
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:09.743
- No. [coughs]

1074
00:40:09.784 --> 00:40:11.453
No. the good guys
are not winning.

1075
00:40:11.494 --> 00:40:12.912
They're actually getting
their asses kicked.

1076
00:40:12.954 --> 00:40:16.207
- I'm sorry. so upsetting.
- Yeah. I'm Gary.

1077
00:40:16.249 --> 00:40:19.419
Do you wanna drink?
Can I buy you a drink?

1078
00:40:19.461 --> 00:40:21.004
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1079
00:40:21.046 --> 00:40:22.088
- I'm Sheila.

1080
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.506
- Okay. Sheila.

1081
00:40:23.548 --> 00:40:26.343
Hey. yo. guy.
[whistles]

1082
00:40:26.384 --> 00:40:27.761
- What can I get?
- IPA.

1083
00:40:27.802 --> 00:40:29.054
- Old fashioned. please.

1084
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.601
- What are you doing here
all alone?

1085
00:40:34.642 --> 00:40:37.103
You're way too beautiful
to be alone in a bar.

1086
00:40:37.145 --> 00:40:38.646
- Oh. [laughs]

1087
00:40:38.688 --> 00:40:40.774
You know.
I'm just picking up guys.

1088
00:40:40.815 --> 00:40:41.816
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

1089
00:40:41.858 --> 00:40:43.860
- Oh. yeah. Who?
- You.

1090
00:40:43.902 --> 00:40:44.944
- Really?

1091
00:40:44.986 --> 00:40:46.446
- You're the only one.
- Okay.

1092
00:40:46.488 --> 00:40:47.864
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1093
00:40:47.906 --> 00:40:51.493
Well. Sheila. it doesn't
look like the good guys

1094
00:40:51.534 --> 00:40:53.036
are gonna come back
anytime soon.

1095
00:40:53.078 --> 00:40:56.289
So what do you say
we get out of here

1096
00:40:56.331 --> 00:40:57.874
and maybe get you some food?

1097
00:40:59.876 --> 00:41:01.252
- Yeah.

1098
00:41:01.294 --> 00:41:02.462
Right now?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1099
00:41:02.504 --> 00:41:03.797
- Okay.
- Okay.

1100
00:41:03.838 --> 00:41:06.049
Hey. give me my 20 back.

1101
00:41:06.091 --> 00:41:07.509
No. no.
- Here you go. Here you go.

1102
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:08.843
- Give me my 20 back.

1103
00:41:08.885 --> 00:41:10.053
- What are you--I just
made these drinks.

1104
00:41:10.095 --> 00:41:11.596
- Well. I don't--

1105
00:41:11.638 --> 00:41:13.723
- So. you know. my dad was a
traveling alcoholic. actually.

1106
00:41:13.765 --> 00:41:16.309
And. um. he just
travelled from bar to bar

1107
00:41:16.351 --> 00:41:17.894
and eventually died.

1108
00:41:17.936 --> 00:41:19.270
- Whoa.

1109
00:41:19.312 --> 00:41:20.563
- Where do you wanna go?

1110
00:41:20.605 --> 00:41:22.065
There's a bunch of Indian
restaurants over here.

1111
00:41:22.107 --> 00:41:23.483
- There's actually a new place
over here I wanted to try.

1112
00:41:23.525 --> 00:41:25.860
Come on. Come on. keep up.

1113
00:41:25.902 --> 00:41:29.030
[soft music playing]

1114
00:41:29.072 --> 00:41:31.157
* *

1115
00:41:31.199 --> 00:41:33.493
Ahh. Isn't that cool?

1116
00:41:33.535 --> 00:41:35.370
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1117
00:41:35.412 --> 00:41:37.497
So what do you do. Miss Sheila?

1118
00:41:37.539 --> 00:41:40.417
- Oh. um.

1119
00:41:40.458 --> 00:41:43.169
I'm an executive
producing assistant.

1120
00:41:43.211 --> 00:41:45.005
- Sounds really intense.

1121
00:41:45.046 --> 00:41:47.465
- Yeah. Like cancer.
Um. what do you do?

1122
00:41:47.507 --> 00:41:49.676
- I run a small
startup company.

1123
00:41:49.718 --> 00:41:52.178
About 25 people--for now.

1124
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.973
- Wow. That's amazing.

1125
00:41:55.015 --> 00:41:55.849
- Yeah.

1126
00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:57.851
- Gary. are you happy?

1127
00:41:57.892 --> 00:42:00.520
Like in life.
are you truly happy?

1128
00:42:00.562 --> 00:42:01.771
- Yeah.

1129
00:42:01.813 --> 00:42:03.982
You know. I mean.
life's weird sometimes.

1130
00:42:04.024 --> 00:42:07.068
but you know. I'm here
for the happy moments.

1131
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:10.488
- Oh. I like that.

1132
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:12.741
- Yeah. uh.

1133
00:42:14.576 --> 00:42:16.703
Thank you. Mm.

1134
00:42:16.745 --> 00:42:19.622
- Is that a tiny fish?

1135
00:42:19.664 --> 00:42:20.999
Are you supposed
to eat this stuff?

1136
00:42:21.041 --> 00:42:22.584
- Yeah.
That is the idea of dinner.

1137
00:42:22.625 --> 00:42:24.002
- Oh. I just thought
that was glass.

1138
00:42:24.044 --> 00:42:26.254
It's a little confusing.
- No. I think it's honeycomb.

1139
00:42:26.296 --> 00:42:27.714
This is one of the best
restaurants in the city.

1140
00:42:27.756 --> 00:42:29.716
Yeah.
So what do you do for fun?

1141
00:42:29.758 --> 00:42:31.259
Me. I like to rock climb.
you know?

1142
00:42:31.301 --> 00:42:32.594
I don't think there's
anything like

1143
00:42:32.635 --> 00:42:34.054
getting up on those rocks.

1144
00:42:34.095 --> 00:42:36.348
Yeah. I like to throw on a pair
of the old spiky boots

1145
00:42:36.389 --> 00:42:38.308
and head down to the mountain.
I don't mean to brag--

1146
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.268
- Gary. I'm from the future.

1147
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.020
- [laughs]
Okay.

1148
00:42:42.062 --> 00:42:43.897
[clears throat]
- No. I'm serious.

1149
00:42:43.938 --> 00:42:46.107
I'm completely serious.
- No. no. no. I'll play along.

1150
00:42:46.149 --> 00:42:48.401
What brings you to the past?
- You.

1151
00:42:48.443 --> 00:42:50.403
- Okay.

1152
00:42:50.445 --> 00:42:52.822
- Yeah.

1153
00:42:52.864 --> 00:42:54.783
Started as an accident.

1154
00:42:54.824 --> 00:42:57.118
but then I fell in love
with you.

1155
00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.413
And I started spending
a lot of time with you.

1156
00:43:00.455 --> 00:43:03.333
365 days to be exact.

1157
00:43:03.375 --> 00:43:04.959
I loved everything about you.

1158
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:07.671
Everything. until I didn't.

1159
00:43:07.712 --> 00:43:08.922
I mean. I do.

1160
00:43:08.963 --> 00:43:10.298
I did. but I just
wanted to. you know.

1161
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.841
I needed to. like.
change a couple things.

1162
00:43:11.883 --> 00:43:14.844
just a couple little things
to make you more perfect.

1163
00:43:14.886 --> 00:43:16.554
You know. make you
more perfect for me. right?

1164
00:43:16.596 --> 00:43:18.556
'Cause that's relationships.
you can't love someone

1165
00:43:18.598 --> 00:43:19.933
100% of the time. right?

1166
00:43:19.974 --> 00:43:22.185
- Yeah. sure. I guess.

1167
00:43:22.227 --> 00:43:23.687
Is that like from
"The Bachelor" or something?

1168
00:43:23.728 --> 00:43:26.147
- Gary. you know how
I always tell you

1169
00:43:26.189 --> 00:43:27.982
that the time machine
in the nail salon's a dud

1170
00:43:28.024 --> 00:43:29.442
and only goes back 24 hours?

1171
00:43:29.484 --> 00:43:31.653
- No. I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

1172
00:43:31.695 --> 00:43:32.946
- Well. I was lying.

1173
00:43:32.987 --> 00:43:34.656
See. there's something
that you should know.

1174
00:43:34.698 --> 00:43:36.991
- It can go anywhere
in the past.

1175
00:43:37.033 --> 00:43:38.952
but for only 24 hours.

1176
00:43:38.993 --> 00:43:40.829
Then zap. you're back here.
- Okay.

1177
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:42.789
June. that is
a fascinating story.

1178
00:43:42.831 --> 00:43:44.624
but I'd really like
to go kill myself now.

1179
00:43:44.666 --> 00:43:46.668
All right?
- You sure?

1180
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:48.169
It's a second chance.

1181
00:43:48.211 --> 00:43:49.963
You can always
kill yourself later.

1182
00:43:50.005 --> 00:43:51.756
- Okay. Let's do it.

1183
00:43:51.798 --> 00:43:53.550
Let's fuck up
some history. huh?

1184
00:43:53.591 --> 00:43:55.218
- That's the spirit.
- Hmm.

1185
00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.720
[whirring]

1186
00:43:56.761 --> 00:43:57.971
And here I am.

1187
00:43:58.013 --> 00:44:00.223
24 hours in the past.

1188
00:44:00.265 --> 00:44:02.350
- Wow.

1189
00:44:02.392 --> 00:44:04.686
Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

1190
00:44:04.728 --> 00:44:06.980
- You can go back
to any point in the past.

1191
00:44:07.022 --> 00:44:09.149
and you chose yesterday?
- Mm-hmm.

1192
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.234
- You didn't wanna go somewhere
more meaningful. like.

1193
00:44:11.276 --> 00:44:12.819
I don't know. like.
to kill Hitler?

1194
00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:15.655
- Well. I did
take out Smithson.

1195
00:44:15.697 --> 00:44:17.365
- Who?
- Exactly.

1196
00:44:17.407 --> 00:44:18.867
And Gary. I mean--
and why yesterday?

1197
00:44:18.908 --> 00:44:20.452
I don't know; I mean.
technically speaking.

1198
00:44:20.493 --> 00:44:22.203
it was actually June's fault.
She chose it.

1199
00:44:22.245 --> 00:44:24.039
And let me tell you. when I
ended up 24 hours in the past.

1200
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:24.998
I was like.
"What the fuck. June?"

1201
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.458
I mean. life is already shit.

1202
00:44:26.499 --> 00:44:28.335
I don't need a reminder
of yesterday's shit. right?

1203
00:44:28.376 --> 00:44:30.462
I kind of preferred. like.
nostalgic childhood shit.

1204
00:44:30.503 --> 00:44:32.464
that I could really like.
But what are you gonna do?

1205
00:44:32.505 --> 00:44:34.883
So then I thought alcohol.
and I stumbled into that bar.

1206
00:44:34.924 --> 00:44:36.551
and then I met you.

1207
00:44:36.593 --> 00:44:39.637
And everything changed.

1208
00:44:39.679 --> 00:44:42.015
- Right.
And that was a year ago?

1209
00:44:42.057 --> 00:44:43.516
- Technically yesterday. but
yes.

1210
00:44:43.558 --> 00:44:45.977
we've been doing this
for an entire year--

1211
00:44:46.019 --> 00:44:48.355
365 days to be exact.

1212
00:44:48.396 --> 00:44:51.858
In fact. it's. um--

1213
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.902
it's our anniversary. Gary.

1214
00:44:55.737 --> 00:44:56.863
- Hey.

1215
00:44:56.905 --> 00:44:58.406
Could I have the check. please?

1216
00:44:58.448 --> 00:45:00.867
- Happy anniversary.

1217
00:45:00.909 --> 00:45:02.535
Gary. thank you
so much for dinner.

1218
00:45:02.577 --> 00:45:03.870
It was delicious.

1219
00:45:03.912 --> 00:45:05.497
So should we head out
and find some dessert?

1220
00:45:05.538 --> 00:45:07.665
- Mm. I don't think so.

1221
00:45:07.707 --> 00:45:09.542
Are you for Gary?

1222
00:45:09.584 --> 00:45:11.086
- Uh. yeah.
- Yeah.

1223
00:45:11.127 --> 00:45:12.879
Look. I actually have
to be up kinda early.

1224
00:45:12.921 --> 00:45:14.964
and I need my rest.

1225
00:45:15.006 --> 00:45:17.050
But this was great.

1226
00:45:17.092 --> 00:45:19.177
- This never happened
with old Gary.

1227
00:45:19.219 --> 00:45:20.970
I must have really
done a number on you.

1228
00:45:21.012 --> 00:45:23.223
Wow. Changes I have made.

1229
00:45:23.264 --> 00:45:26.226
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Is that so? Hey. Hey.

1230
00:45:26.267 --> 00:45:27.811
- Oh. I thought you were--
- No. listen.

1231
00:45:27.852 --> 00:45:30.980
Look. not that I'm buying any
of your bullshit. future girl.

1232
00:45:31.022 --> 00:45:33.149
but just out of curiosity.
just 'cause I wanna know.

1233
00:45:33.191 --> 00:45:35.068
what exactly did
you change about me

1234
00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:36.986
that was so fucking awful?
- Oh. okay.

1235
00:45:37.028 --> 00:45:38.446
So we've spent
a lot of time together.

1236
00:45:38.488 --> 00:45:40.407
and you've shared
a lot with me. okay?

1237
00:45:40.448 --> 00:45:42.409
Like. I know all
about your childhood.

1238
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:44.953
your disappointments. the ups
and downs. all the traumas.

1239
00:45:44.994 --> 00:45:46.413
And I've kind of. like.
narrowed them down

1240
00:45:46.454 --> 00:45:48.540
to the moments that aided
in your mental decline.

1241
00:45:48.581 --> 00:45:51.251
I call them the. "where things
went wrong for Gary" moments.

1242
00:45:51.292 --> 00:45:52.794
- Oh. is that what
you call them?

1243
00:45:52.836 --> 00:45:54.504
- Hey. dial down the sarcasm.

1244
00:45:54.546 --> 00:45:56.006
It's our fucking anniversary.

1245
00:45:56.047 --> 00:45:57.882
So anyway. I traveled back
there and I fixed them.

1246
00:45:57.924 --> 00:45:59.092
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1247
00:45:59.134 --> 00:46:00.593
- Give me an example of one.
- Fine.

1248
00:46:00.635 --> 00:46:01.886
[whirring]

1249
00:46:01.928 --> 00:46:03.722
[inquisitive music]

1250
00:46:03.763 --> 00:46:06.224
- Yes?
- You're Gary. right?

1251
00:46:06.266 --> 00:46:07.726
- Mom!
- [clears throat]

1252
00:46:07.767 --> 00:46:10.270
My name's Charlie and I just
moved in across the street.

1253
00:46:10.311 --> 00:46:11.604
- Okay.

1254
00:46:11.646 --> 00:46:15.358
- May I interest you
in a friendly game of catch?

1255
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.027
- I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

1256
00:46:17.068 --> 00:46:18.903
- Can I tell you
a little secret?

1257
00:46:18.945 --> 00:46:21.197
I lost my son many years ago.

1258
00:46:21.239 --> 00:46:22.907
in a boating accident.
actually.

1259
00:46:22.949 --> 00:46:24.784
and it makes me
very. very. very sad

1260
00:46:24.826 --> 00:46:26.244
and I miss him so much.

1261
00:46:26.286 --> 00:46:27.746
It would truly mean
the world to me

1262
00:46:27.787 --> 00:46:30.165
if you would humor an old man
and play a friendly game

1263
00:46:30.206 --> 00:46:32.167
of catch out in the yard.

1264
00:46:32.208 --> 00:46:35.211
What do you say. sport?

1265
00:46:35.253 --> 00:46:36.254
- Okay.

1266
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:39.007
- You should watch
more wrestling.

1267
00:46:39.049 --> 00:46:41.051
The fake kind.

1268
00:46:41.092 --> 00:46:43.136
- It's not fake.
- It's pretty fake. kid.

1269
00:46:43.178 --> 00:46:45.889
A lot of people are gonna
say you're wrong. Gary.

1270
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:47.349
Fuck them.

1271
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:49.893
- Okay.

1272
00:46:49.934 --> 00:46:52.645
- Oh. God. Gary. no.

1273
00:46:52.687 --> 00:46:54.522
- My miming's good. right?

1274
00:46:54.564 --> 00:46:56.441
- Gary. no. Don't do that.

1275
00:46:56.483 --> 00:46:58.109
People don't like mimes.

1276
00:46:58.151 --> 00:46:59.611
Please don't do that again.

1277
00:46:59.652 --> 00:47:00.779
- Hey. wait.

1278
00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.155
Just wait a second.
- What?

1279
00:47:02.197 --> 00:47:04.240
- You were Uncle Charlie?
- It was I.

1280
00:47:04.282 --> 00:47:07.243
- You're so fucking crazy.
That's fucking crazy.

1281
00:47:07.285 --> 00:47:08.370
- Why?

1282
00:47:08.411 --> 00:47:09.537
We just played
a little catch. big deal.

1283
00:47:09.579 --> 00:47:11.122
- Sheila. I played catch
with Uncle Charlie

1284
00:47:11.164 --> 00:47:13.166
every Sunday afternoon
for. like. three years.

1285
00:47:13.208 --> 00:47:14.584
- I know.
Gary. what can I say?

1286
00:47:14.626 --> 00:47:16.044
I'm very methodical.

1287
00:47:16.086 --> 00:47:17.379
I went back a bunch to make
a difference in your life.

1288
00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:18.588
You're welcome.

1289
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:20.048
- How do you not see
how fucked up this is?

1290
00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:22.592
- What?
- What? I loved that guy.

1291
00:47:22.634 --> 00:47:25.470
I fucking loved Uncle Charlie.

1292
00:47:25.512 --> 00:47:27.263
He was like my dad.

1293
00:47:27.305 --> 00:47:29.182
- I know.
That is the whole point.

1294
00:47:29.224 --> 00:47:30.767
- No. it's not the point.

1295
00:47:30.809 --> 00:47:32.227
You can't just
choose for people.

1296
00:47:32.268 --> 00:47:33.478
You can't just do that.

1297
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.854
You can't just put
a positive influence

1298
00:47:34.896 --> 00:47:36.648
and pawn 'em on someone
and hope it all works out.

1299
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:39.693
You can't fucking do that.
That's not how life works.

1300
00:47:39.734 --> 00:47:40.944
What else did you change?

1301
00:47:40.985 --> 00:47:42.320
- [stammers]
Well. just a couple things.

1302
00:47:42.362 --> 00:47:43.697
I just deleted a few people.

1303
00:47:43.738 --> 00:47:46.408
You know. like your
middle school bully. Patrick.

1304
00:47:46.449 --> 00:47:49.494
and your math teacher.
Mrs. Kaiser. and Amber. duh.

1305
00:47:49.536 --> 00:47:50.995
- Oh. my God!
- But that's all.

1306
00:47:51.037 --> 00:47:52.956
That's all. That's all.
- Well. that's all? That's all?

1307
00:47:52.997 --> 00:47:54.416
- Oh. actually no.
there is one more thing.

1308
00:47:54.457 --> 00:47:57.252
[knock at door]

1309
00:47:57.293 --> 00:47:59.754
- Hey. kiddo. how's it going?
I heard you ordered a pizza.

1310
00:47:59.796 --> 00:48:02.549
- Oh. I didn't order any.
- Oh. my God. Tatiana?

1311
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.551
I lost my virginity to her.
- Uh. you're welcome.

1312
00:48:04.592 --> 00:48:07.012
- You're unbelievable.
You're un-fucking-believable.

1313
00:48:07.053 --> 00:48:09.055
You're fucking psychotic.
- Hey. that is not fair.

1314
00:48:09.097 --> 00:48:11.725
I've heard you talk about your
pain over and over and over.

1315
00:48:11.766 --> 00:48:13.852
night after night after night.
and it has broken my heart.

1316
00:48:13.893 --> 00:48:16.896
I have this unique ability
to take your pain away.

1317
00:48:16.938 --> 00:48:18.106
- Oh. guess what?

1318
00:48:18.148 --> 00:48:19.274
It's not yours
to take away. Sheila.

1319
00:48:19.315 --> 00:48:20.650
- It came from a good place.
Gary.

1320
00:48:20.692 --> 00:48:21.860
- Yeah. and so did
gender-reveal parties.

1321
00:48:21.901 --> 00:48:22.819
- You know what?
I don't need your

1322
00:48:22.861 --> 00:48:24.279
fucking attitude right now.

1323
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.488
I'm just gonna go back and
I'm gonna tweak a few things

1324
00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:26.990
and fix this
so this didn't happen.

1325
00:48:27.032 --> 00:48:28.241
- Oh. well. go ahead.

1326
00:48:28.283 --> 00:48:29.409
Go do whatever you want.
'Cause guess what?

1327
00:48:29.451 --> 00:48:30.785
I'll still never
wanna be with you.

1328
00:48:30.827 --> 00:48:32.328
- No. not true.
I will reset you.

1329
00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:33.496
You'll remember nothing. Easy.

1330
00:48:33.538 --> 00:48:34.664
- Yeah.
I will remember. actually.

1331
00:48:34.706 --> 00:48:36.791
- No. you won't remember.
- Yeah. I will.

1332
00:48:36.833 --> 00:48:38.710
- Really? A Sharpie. Gary?

1333
00:48:38.752 --> 00:48:41.296
You are so dumb.
- Yeah. Sheila sucks balls.

1334
00:48:41.338 --> 00:48:42.505
- You can't even spell.

1335
00:48:42.547 --> 00:48:44.174
That's not going
to be there tomorrow.

1336
00:48:44.215 --> 00:48:46.176
Do you understand?
- Fine. yeah. Maybe it won't.

1337
00:48:46.217 --> 00:48:47.927
Maybe I won't remember
this conversation.

1338
00:48:47.969 --> 00:48:49.179
Maybe I won't
remember this night.

1339
00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.472
Maybe I won't remember
those two ladies.

1340
00:48:50.513 --> 00:48:52.432
But I will remember
this feeling.

1341
00:48:52.474 --> 00:48:54.267
- Gary. I've done this
hundreds of times.

1342
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:56.269
and you never remember.
- Oh. yeah?

1343
00:48:56.311 --> 00:48:58.146
Were all of our dates
this shitty?

1344
00:48:58.188 --> 00:49:00.106
- Actually no.
You used to fucking love them.

1345
00:49:00.148 --> 00:49:01.608
- Oh. I used to
fucking love them.

1346
00:49:01.649 --> 00:49:03.610
I wonder what happened.
Uh. I don't know. [stammers]

1347
00:49:03.651 --> 00:49:05.695
Do you realize you can't
erase everything?

1348
00:49:05.737 --> 00:49:08.448
- No. it's because
relationships need work. Gary.

1349
00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:10.867
We just have to work on it.
That's all.

1350
00:49:10.909 --> 00:49:12.952
- Well. maybe. just maybe.
you try to make things better.

1351
00:49:12.994 --> 00:49:14.120
but you actually
make them worse.

1352
00:49:14.162 --> 00:49:15.955
And maybe some shit sticks.

1353
00:49:15.997 --> 00:49:17.165
- No. that's not
how this works.

1354
00:49:17.207 --> 00:49:18.291
No. Gary.
I will prove you wrong.

1355
00:49:18.333 --> 00:49:20.085
I will fucking prove you wrong.

1356
00:49:20.126 --> 00:49:23.171
- Good luck!
- [screams]

1357
00:49:23.213 --> 00:49:25.382
- Personally. I think that
he should feel touched

1358
00:49:25.423 --> 00:49:27.509
that somebody cares so deeply

1359
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:32.055
to take away all the pain
of his life.

1360
00:49:32.097 --> 00:49:36.810
- Oh. that is a really
romantic gesture.

1361
00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:40.438
[upbeat music
playing in reverse]

1362
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.981
- Ooh.
- No. it's okay.

1363
00:49:42.023 --> 00:49:45.652
Shh. shh. No. no. It's fine.
Shh. Please understand.

1364
00:49:45.694 --> 00:49:46.736
- [screaming]

1365
00:49:46.778 --> 00:49:49.364
- [screams]

1366
00:49:49.406 --> 00:49:51.991
- Gary.
Here's your sexy pizza. Gary.

1367
00:49:52.033 --> 00:49:54.202
Yeah. Okay.

1368
00:49:54.244 --> 00:49:56.371
- Damn it. Wait.

1369
00:49:56.413 --> 00:49:58.289
And then the karate instructor.

1370
00:49:58.331 --> 00:49:59.249
he did not put up a fight
at all.

1371
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:00.375
It was very surprising.

1372
00:50:00.417 --> 00:50:01.710
But then I came over
to get you.

1373
00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:03.837
Little. cute Tatiana.
she doesn't deserve that.

1374
00:50:03.878 --> 00:50:05.005
I couldn't do it.

1375
00:50:05.046 --> 00:50:07.424
So you know.
that's why we're here.

1376
00:50:07.465 --> 00:50:09.384
- Hmm.

1377
00:50:09.426 --> 00:50:11.011
- Hello?

1378
00:50:11.052 --> 00:50:13.013
- Oh. maybe next year. Gary.

1379
00:50:13.054 --> 00:50:14.556
Shut the door.

1380
00:50:14.597 --> 00:50:15.557
Come on.

1381
00:50:17.892 --> 00:50:19.561
Cute kid.

1382
00:50:19.602 --> 00:50:20.979
- He will be.

1383
00:50:21.021 --> 00:50:23.606
[machine buzzing]

1384
00:50:26.067 --> 00:50:29.195
Ugh. June. Ah.

1385
00:50:29.237 --> 00:50:31.322
I did it. Yeah. I did it.

1386
00:50:31.364 --> 00:50:34.784
Or I undid it. rather. Oh.

1387
00:50:34.826 --> 00:50:36.327
[laughs] Oh.

1388
00:50:36.369 --> 00:50:39.873
Now me and Gary can go back

that when I was born.

I'm so sorry.

- Yeah. so when I was old
enough to fend for myself.

1416
00:51:34.302 --> 00:51:36.971

on your soul.

can't actually undo that.

you erase the person.

01:00:52.235 --> 01:00:54.362
Okay?
And you need to let me go.

1561
01:00:55.697 --> 01:00:57.657
- No.
- Yes.

1562
01:00:57.699 --> 01:00:59.492
- No.
- Yes.

1563
01:00:59.534 --> 01:01:01.327
- No.
- Please.

1564
01:01:01.369 --> 01:01:03.079
- I can't. I'm so sorry.

1565
01:01:03.121 --> 01:01:05.165
I can't. I can't.
I can't. I can't.

1566
01:01:05.206 --> 01:01:07.500
I'm sorry. I can't.
- Okay. Okay. you know what?

1567
01:01:07.542 --> 01:01:10.003
Maybe I go back in time

1568
01:01:10.045 --> 01:01:11.379
and I stop you...
- What?

1569
01:01:11.421 --> 01:01:12.881
- From ever becoming
obsessed with this night

1570
01:01:12.922 --> 01:01:14.007
in the first place.
- No.

1571
01:01:14.049 --> 01:01:15.216
No. no. no. no.
You can't do that.

1572
01:01:15.258 --> 01:01:16.509
You can't do that.
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1573
01:01:16.551 --> 01:01:17.844
Yeah. Maybe I will.
- No. no. no. no. no. no.

1574
01:01:17.886 --> 01:01:19.179
- Maybe I might. Maybe I might.

1575
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.430
Maybe I'll go back to.
I know where it is now.

1576
01:01:20.472 --> 01:01:21.598
it's at the nail salon. right?

1577
01:01:21.639 --> 01:01:23.433
Maybe I pay our old friend.
is it June?

1578
01:01:23.475 --> 01:01:25.435
I'd pay her a visit.
- No. you wouldn't do that.

1579
01:01:25.477 --> 01:01:27.020
No. no. no. You can't do that.

1580
01:01:27.062 --> 01:01:29.397
- Look. I don't know
what fuck the is going on.

1581
01:01:29.439 --> 01:01:32.525
but I do know that
I can't--I can't do this.

1582
01:01:32.567 --> 01:01:35.987
This is not--this is not right.

1583
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:38.531
I'm really sorry. Sheila.

1584
01:01:38.573 --> 01:01:40.450
Yeah. I'm really sorry.

1585
01:01:43.745 --> 01:01:46.539
- You don't understand.

1586
01:01:46.581 --> 01:01:47.916
You saved me.

1587
01:01:50.877 --> 01:01:54.547
This whole night saved me.

1588
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:56.758
I'm so scared.

1589
01:01:58.301 --> 01:01:59.511
Gary. it could be
the only thing

1590
01:01:59.552 --> 01:02:01.846
that ever makes me happy.

1591
01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:05.350
Do you understand that?

1592
01:02:17.404 --> 01:02:20.657
- Okay. fine.

1593
01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:22.033
- What?

1594
01:02:22.075 --> 01:02:24.661
- Fine. we'll--

1595
01:02:24.703 --> 01:02:26.454
we'll try it your way.

1596
01:02:26.496 --> 01:02:30.291
- What do you mean?
What do you mean?

1597
01:02:30.333 --> 01:02:32.085
- Let's just. uh.

1598
01:02:32.127 --> 01:02:34.087
let's just try again tomorrow.

1599
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:39.259
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1600
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:44.431
Who knows?
Maybe tomorrow we get it right?

1601
01:02:44.472 --> 01:02:49.436
So I'll see you tomorrow.

1602
01:02:49.477 --> 01:02:51.229
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1603
01:03:13.668 --> 01:03:16.796
[suspenseful music]

1604
01:03:16.838 --> 01:03:23.970
* *

1605
01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:46.284
- Good evening.
You must be Gary.

1606
01:03:46.326 --> 01:03:49.913
- Jesus Christ.
does everybody know my name?

1607
01:03:49.954 --> 01:03:51.456
Oh.
- What can I do for you. Gary?

1608
01:03:51.498 --> 01:03:54.918
You want a midnight pedicure?
- No. Um.

1609
01:03:54.959 --> 01:03:56.461
[sighs] I'm not exactly sure
how to say this.

1610
01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:59.422
Are you June by chance?
- Huh?

1611
01:03:59.464 --> 01:04:02.884
- 'Cause. uh.
I'm here about Sheila.

1612
01:04:02.926 --> 01:04:05.428
- Who?
- [clears throat]

1613
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:07.347
- Sheila.
the time-traveling lady.

1614
01:04:07.389 --> 01:04:08.765
- Sheila...

1615
01:04:08.807 --> 01:04:10.934
- She told me that she
comes here. goes back in time.

1616
01:04:10.975 --> 01:04:13.436
Ah. fuck.
Was she fucking with me?

1617
01:04:13.478 --> 01:04:15.772
She was fucking with me.
wasn't she?

1618
01:04:15.814 --> 01:04:17.399
Yeah. why would I believe that?

1619
01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.942
Every time a hot girl...
[mutters indistinctly]

1620
01:04:18.983 --> 01:04:20.819
- Relax. Gary.

1621
01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:24.197
- What?
- I know who Sheila is.

1622
01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:25.657
You probably wanna
see the time machine.

1623
01:04:25.699 --> 01:04:27.367
- Yes. I wanna fucking go see
the time machine. yes.

1624
01:04:27.409 --> 01:04:28.827
- Okay.

1625
01:04:28.868 --> 01:04:31.204
- I wanna prevent this night
from ever happening.

1626
01:04:33.748 --> 01:04:35.333
This?

1627
01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:37.335
This is the source
of all my problems?

1628
01:04:37.377 --> 01:04:38.795
- Yeah.

1629
01:04:38.837 --> 01:04:41.047
But sounds like you had a
pretty sweet night last night.

1630
01:04:41.089 --> 01:04:43.800
- Yeah. over and over
and over again.

1631
01:04:43.842 --> 01:04:45.260
like I'm in some
sort of fucked-up

1632
01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:46.886
permanent purgatory hell.

1633
01:04:46.928 --> 01:04:48.555
- So like love?

1634
01:04:48.596 --> 01:04:50.098
- No. not at all.

1635
01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.683
She keeps making me
do the same thing.

1636
01:04:51.725 --> 01:04:54.185
And what's weird about it is.
I like her.

1637
01:04:54.227 --> 01:04:56.104
- Oh. so like a relationship?

1638
01:04:56.146 --> 01:04:58.398
- No. not like
a relationship at all.

1639
01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.443
I get emotionally involved
and then somehow get hurt.

1640
01:05:01.484 --> 01:05:03.486
and I don't even know
how many times she's done it.

1641
01:05:03.528 --> 01:05:05.071
- So like love?

1642
01:05:05.113 --> 01:05:09.075
- No. 'cause love is--
love is real.

1643
01:05:09.117 --> 01:05:11.161
This is not. This is very fake.

1644
01:05:11.202 --> 01:05:15.165
This is orchestrated.
This is inorganic.

1645
01:05:15.206 --> 01:05:17.208
- You ever had
an organic banana?

1646
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:18.877
It tastes just like
a regular banana.

1647
01:05:18.918 --> 01:05:20.712
- Okay. What?

1648
01:05:20.754 --> 01:05:23.340
I don't know what that means.
but can we do this please?

1649
01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:24.799
- Do you know
where you're going?

1650
01:05:24.841 --> 01:05:28.303
- Yeah. I am going back in time
to where it all started.

1651
01:05:28.345 --> 01:05:31.556
Wait. which is when?
When would that be?

1652
01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:33.808
- Um. 1999?
- All right. Cool.

1653
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:35.935
Wait. that doesn't sound right.
Wait. June.

1654
01:05:35.977 --> 01:05:37.437
Wait. I'm a little
claustrophobic.

1655
01:05:37.479 --> 01:05:40.815
June. Oh. no.
June. I gotta piss.

1656
01:05:40.857 --> 01:05:42.484
Can I piss back in the future?

1657
01:05:49.574 --> 01:05:52.202
600. Apartment 1K.

1658
01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:57.624
Here we fucking go.

1659
01:06:02.003 --> 01:06:04.297
- Yeah?

1660
01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:06.758
- Hey.
- Come on in. You're late.

1661
01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.552
- What?
- Gary?

1662
01:06:09.594 --> 01:06:11.096
- Yeah.

1663
01:06:11.137 --> 01:06:14.099
Oh. she's too young.
I came back too far.

1664
01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.059
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I gotta go.

1665
01:06:16.101 --> 01:06:18.395
- All right. you weirdo.
TV's right there.

1666
01:06:18.436 --> 01:06:20.188
- T--

1667
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:24.776
oh. right. the TV.

1668
01:06:24.818 --> 01:06:26.653
- Awesome.

1669
01:06:26.695 --> 01:06:29.739
Sheila. don't you bother
this man while he's working.

1670
01:06:29.781 --> 01:06:31.366
Mommy's gotta get pretty.

1671
01:06:31.408 --> 01:06:35.578
- Oh. I'm supposed to come back
to when you're like 16 or 17

1672
01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.330
so I can. you know.
catch you when you were

1673
01:06:37.372 --> 01:06:39.374
developing your crazy
and maybe help you out.

1674
01:06:39.416 --> 01:06:40.667
but you're way too young.

1675
01:06:40.709 --> 01:06:42.669
and now I have to
yell at a little kid

1676
01:06:42.711 --> 01:06:43.837
and traumatize people.

1677
01:06:43.878 --> 01:06:44.921
Fuck.

1678
01:06:44.963 --> 01:06:46.881
- And watch out
for my daughter.

1679
01:06:46.923 --> 01:06:48.758
She can be quite dramatic.

1680
01:06:50.552 --> 01:06:54.723
She got that
from her father. obviously.

1681
01:06:54.764 --> 01:06:58.268
- That doesn't--
that's not gonna work

1682
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:59.644
no matter how hard you--
- Hey. guy!

1683
01:06:59.686 --> 01:07:01.896
[hair dryer whirring]
What's going out there?

1684
01:07:01.938 --> 01:07:04.733
Honey. [indistinct].

1685
01:07:08.153 --> 01:07:10.071
- Please.
- Nobody wants to hear it.

1686
01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:11.322
- You're a little girl.

1687
01:07:11.364 --> 01:07:13.408
- Sheila. where did you put
Mommy's eyeliner?

1688
01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:15.410
- [crying]
- Hey.

1689
01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:16.786
- Hey.

1690
01:07:16.828 --> 01:07:18.413
Hey. please don't cry.

1691
01:07:18.455 --> 01:07:21.374
- Sheila. for the love of God.

1692
01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:25.712
Sheila. quit making
all that noise!

1693
01:07:25.754 --> 01:07:28.131
Sheila!

1694
01:07:28.173 --> 01:07:31.801
- Hey. Hey.
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

1695
01:07:31.843 --> 01:07:37.057
- [crying]
- Hey. hey. hey.

1696
01:07:37.098 --> 01:07:38.350
It's okay.

1697
01:07:38.391 --> 01:07:40.894
Hey. can you repeat after me?

1698
01:07:40.935 --> 01:07:42.812
Okay? It's okay.

1699
01:07:42.854 --> 01:07:44.397
- It's okay.

1700
01:07:44.439 --> 01:07:47.025
- For things to be
messy sometimes.

1701
01:07:47.067 --> 01:07:49.235
- For things
to be messy sometimes.

1702
01:07:49.277 --> 01:07:52.280
- Okay. It's okay.

1703
01:07:52.322 --> 01:07:55.784
[gentle music]

1704
01:07:55.825 --> 01:07:56.826
It's okay.

1705
01:08:00.872 --> 01:08:02.499
It's okay. it's okay.

1706
01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:05.001
It's always gonna be okay.

1707
01:08:05.043 --> 01:08:07.003
I don't know how you did it.
but you got it in there.

1708
01:08:07.045 --> 01:08:09.130
- God damn it.
I'm running late.

1709
01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:11.091
Is it fixed?

1710
01:08:11.132 --> 01:08:13.009
- Yeah. Working on it.

1711
01:08:13.051 --> 01:08:16.054
What is up with your mother?

1712
01:08:16.096 --> 01:08:17.764
She never stops.

1713
01:08:17.806 --> 01:08:19.140
Okay.

1714
01:08:19.182 --> 01:08:21.017
Did that make you feel
a little better?

1715
01:08:21.059 --> 01:08:22.644
Mm-hmm?

1716
01:08:22.686 --> 01:08:29.609
* *

1717
01:08:38.618 --> 01:08:42.122
- June. Hi.

1718
01:08:42.163 --> 01:08:44.082
Hey. I just wanted
to come thank you

1719
01:08:44.124 --> 01:08:46.918
for the last few months.
or years.

1720
01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:49.504
I don't know how long
it's been. but. um.

1721
01:08:49.546 --> 01:08:53.466
I've been thinking a lot
about giving up control.

1722
01:08:53.508 --> 01:08:56.261
you know. and I realize
that that's just not me.

1723
01:08:56.302 --> 01:08:58.304
I can't do that.

1724
01:08:58.346 --> 01:09:02.809
So this is me saying
thank you. and goodbye.

1725
01:09:02.851 --> 01:09:06.021
That's a good color.
That's my favorite color.

1726
01:09:06.062 --> 01:09:07.272
That's a good one.

1727
01:09:07.313 --> 01:09:14.446
* *

1728
01:09:16.197 --> 01:09:17.741
Sorry. just one more thing.

1729

1902
01:20:12.812 --> 01:20:15.523
- Mmm.
- The cones are inedible.

1903
01:20:15.565 --> 01:20:16.691
Don't eat them.

1904
01:20:16.733 --> 01:20:17.734
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Oh.

1905
01:20:17.776 --> 01:20:18.943
- Oh. it's okay.
- Oh. no.

1906
01:20:18.985 --> 01:20:21.321
- Bye. Gary.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1907
01:20:21.363 --> 01:20:23.490
- Thirsty?
- Yeah. I wanna hit that. Phil.

1908
01:20:23.531 --> 01:20:25.867
I wanna hit that real hard.
Happy?

1909
01:20:25.909 --> 01:20:26.951
- What can I get you?

1910
01:20:26.993 --> 01:20:28.078
both:
Old fashioned.

1911
01:20:28.119 --> 01:20:30.997
- How adorable.

1912
01:20:31.039 --> 01:20:33.124
- I'm Sheila.
- Hi. Sheila. I'm Gary.

1913
01:20:33.166 --> 01:20:34.584
- We have old-timey names.

1914
01:20:34.626 --> 01:20:35.877
- We do.
- Mm-hmm.

1915
01:20:35.919 --> 01:20:38.797
- Locally sourced
Sour Patch Kids roughly shaved

1916
01:20:38.838 --> 01:20:44.344
onto a bed of whimsical romaine
lettuce-flavored gelato.

1917
01:20:44.386 --> 01:20:45.345
- All right.

1918
01:20:45.387 --> 01:20:48.223
- Two.

1919
01:20:48.264 --> 01:20:49.849
- Wow.

1920
01:20:49.891 --> 01:20:53.728
* *

1921
01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:55.689
It's kind of peaceful to just--

1922
01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:57.857
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1923
01:20:57.899 --> 01:20:59.859
Great job. sir.

1924
01:20:59.901 --> 01:21:01.403
- Cheers to you.
- To you.

1925
01:21:01.444 --> 01:21:03.279
And put money in your hat.
- Mm-hmm.

1926
01:21:03.321 --> 01:21:05.573
[both shriek]
- Oh. fucking Jesus Christ!

1927
01:21:05.615 --> 01:21:09.869
What made you wanna go back.
like. in time?

1928
01:21:09.911 --> 01:21:12.163
- Vacation.
- Hmm.

1929
01:21:12.205 --> 01:21:18.128
You went on vacation
so you could hang with me?

1930
01:21:18.169 --> 01:21:20.672
- Well. I just kinda
popped into this bar.

1931
01:21:20.714 --> 01:21:23.758
and you were the only one
not watching sports on TV.

1932
01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.176
- Ah.
- Yeah.

1933
01:21:25.218 --> 01:21:27.721
Not really a sports fan?
- No.

1934
01:21:27.762 --> 01:21:29.556
both: Rare breed.

1935
01:21:29.597 --> 01:21:31.599

01:21:34.769 --> 01:21:36.396
with vanilla swirls.

1938
01:21:36.438 --> 01:21:38.940
- Did you know
I was married once?

1939
01:21:38.982 --> 01:21:40.442
- Get out of here. Just once?
- Uh-huh.

1940
01:21:40.483 --> 01:21:44.112
It was just once. but it
was five very long years.

1941
01:21:44.154 --> 01:21:46.823
- Oh. I'm sorry.
What made you wanna get out?

1942
01:21:46.865 --> 01:21:48.324
- Aw. You're very sweet.

1943
01:21:48.366 --> 01:21:49.909
He wanted to get out.
He left me.

1944
01:21:49.951 --> 01:21:51.077
- Why?

1945
01:21:51.119 --> 01:21:53.455
Who is--who would ever
leave you?

1946
01:21:53.496 --> 01:21:56.541
Well. I'm in a
similar situation.

1947
01:21:56.583 --> 01:21:59.252
I just got out of a pretty
long year relationship

1948
01:21:59.294 --> 01:22:00.920
with a girl named Amber.

1949
01:22:00.962 --> 01:22:01.921
- For fuck's sake. Gary.
nothing good

1950
01:22:01.963 --> 01:22:04.257
comes from a girl named Amber.

1951
01:22:04.299 --> 01:22:06.760
both: Old fashioned.

1952
01:22:06.801 --> 01:22:08.720
- How adorable.

1953
01:22:08.762 --> 01:22:12.098
- Okay. two old fashioneds.
and you can fuck off. Phil.

1954
01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:13.475
- Wait. what?
- Oh. nothing.

1955
01:22:13.516 --> 01:22:16.978
- Organic red velvet pieces
crushed into a bed

1956
01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.064
of lost feelings. hopes.
and dreams

1957
01:22:19.105 --> 01:22:21.316
drizzled with tears.

1958
01:22:21.358 --> 01:22:22.901
- Mmm.

1959
01:22:22.942 --> 01:22:24.861
[patrons cheering]

1960
01:22:24.903 --> 01:22:26.279
Yeah. feeling real thirsty.

1961
01:22:26.321 --> 01:22:27.781
but not for your
side commentary.

1962
01:22:27.822 --> 01:22:31.159
I'm pretty quenched
on that account. okay?

1963
01:22:31.201 --> 01:22:34.788
- So I gotta ask.
you know John Connor?

1964
01:22:34.829 --> 01:22:36.164
"The Terminator".

1965
01:22:36.206 --> 01:22:37.624
He's from the future.

1966
01:22:37.665 --> 01:22:40.251
You know. Michael Biehn
was in that movie.

1967
01:22:40.293 --> 01:22:42.629
and--and then--and nothing.

1968
01:22:42.671 --> 01:22:44.673
- It's all just. like.
a big joke to you. isn't it?

1969
01:22:44.714 --> 01:22:46.716
You just don't take any
of this seriously. It's fine.

1970
01:22:46.758 --> 01:22:48.093
- I'm pretty neurotic.

1971
01:22:48.134 --> 01:22:49.761
I. like. develop these
coping mechanisms.

1972
01:22:49.803 --> 01:22:51.137
you know. to keep myself sane.

1973
01:22:51.179 --> 01:22:52.263
I wasn't. like.
murdering people.

1974
01:22:52.305 --> 01:22:53.890
- Oh. good.
- You?

1975
01:22:53.932 --> 01:22:55.058
There's a lot of
choices over there.

1976
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:56.059
- There are.
Ooh. let's go to this one.

1977
01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:57.560
Hi. Amit.

1978
01:22:57.602 --> 01:23:00.271
- So do you wanna tell me
about the future?

1979
01:23:00.313 --> 01:23:01.523
- What's the point?
You never believe me anyways.

1980
01:23:01.564 --> 01:23:03.775
- The point is.
it's interesting.

1981
01:23:03.817 --> 01:23:05.068
- Mm.

1982
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.778
- So I have a cat.

1983
01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:08.988
I'm allergic to them.
so I had to get

1984
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:11.574
one of those shaved ones.

1985
01:23:11.616 --> 01:23:13.868
both: Cheers. mate.
- They're called a sphynx.

1986
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:15.286
But it's weird.

1987
01:23:15.328 --> 01:23:17.455
If you put them up
next to my grandfather.

1988
01:23:17.497 --> 01:23:19.416
you kinda can't
tell the difference.

1989
01:23:23.128 --> 01:23:24.504
- You're not even
gonna remember this.

1990
01:23:24.546 --> 01:23:28.383
and it just makes me so.
so. so sad. Gary. you know?

1991
01:23:30.135 --> 01:23:32.053
The future is fucked.

1992
01:23:32.095 --> 01:23:34.681
Let's liven it up in here.
This place sucks.

1993
01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:36.266
Hey. Susan.

1994
01:23:36.307 --> 01:23:37.434
Are you mad at me?
- Mm-mm.

1995
01:23:37.475 --> 01:23:38.518
- Are you mad at me?
- Mm-mm.

1996
01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.186
- I'm so sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

1997
01:23:40.228 --> 01:23:42.522
- I am so sorry.
- Mm-mm.

1998
01:23:42.564 --> 01:23:45.483
- I see years together--Amit.
I'm trying to talk here.

1999
01:23:45.525 --> 01:23:47.819
What do you see. Gary?
- Um.

2000
01:23:47.861 --> 01:23:50.363
- You don't see it--
you don't see it. Gary?

2001
01:23:50.405 --> 01:23:53.283
- No. I see it.
Two little kids.

2002
01:23:53.324 --> 01:23:54.701
No. it's fine.
Two kids and a dog and--

2003
01:23:54.743 --> 01:23:57.704
- Oh. my God. Gary.
No. you're just saying that.

2004
01:23:57.746 --> 01:23:59.039
- It's okay.

2005
01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.707
- [wailing]

2006
01:24:00.749 --> 01:24:02.751
Gary!

2007
01:24:02.792 --> 01:24:04.502
- I guess what
I'm trying to say is.

2008
01:24:04.544 --> 01:24:06.379
I haven't done this
in a long time.

2009
01:24:06.421 --> 01:24:09.049
and I'm having
a lot of fun. so.

2010
01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:11.551
- [laughs]
It's okay. I get you.

2011
01:24:11.593 --> 01:24:13.887
Lucky for you. my mouth
speaks before my brain

2012
01:24:13.928 --> 01:24:16.056
tells it to. so no guesswork.

2013
01:24:16.097 --> 01:24:19.309
- I know.
I really like that.

2014
01:24:19.351 --> 01:24:21.353
- [laughs]
You like it now.

2015
01:24:21.394 --> 01:24:24.230
but give it a while.
you might get tired of it.

2016
01:24:24.272 --> 01:24:27.609
- No. I won't.
