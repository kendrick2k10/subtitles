00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.840
You've probably heard of Lotus.

Downloaded from

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.160
It made championship
winning racing cars.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.400
the 500 with a comfortable
lead of more than...

7
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.880
It made iconic lightweight
sports cars.

8
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.320
Last year the company increased
its car production by 48%

9
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.320
- the Lotus has become a
success story for Britain.

10
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.520
They even made cars for the stars.

11
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.840
Orders are already pouring in
from America for the same colour

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.480
scheme as Bond's car.

13
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.120
It's still around today.

14
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.080
even though the one thing it's never
been good at in recent years

15
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.640
is making money.

16
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.040
There's been money issues.

17
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.960
Lots of changes of management.

18
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760
Things have got to change...

19
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.120
Phwoff! It's been a baptism of fire.

20
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.960
I've slept better in Afghanistan
than I have working here.

21
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.800
Lotus has to become a proper.
profitable carmaker

22
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.520
or admit defeat and shut up shop.

23
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.560
It's a commercial business
and we can't just produce one.

24
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.120
we've got to produce thousands.

25
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.920
To give it one last shot.
there's a new boss...

26
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.480
I don't want to just keep it going.

27
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.520
I want to lay the foundation so that
Lotus is going to be secure.

28
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.560
..and soon their first new
car in over a decade.

29
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.680
This car is make or break
for Lotus. basically.

30
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.240
They can't afford to get this wrong.

31
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.040
This is step one of the Lotus
revival plan -

32
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.920
an all-new all-electric
200mph hyper car

33
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.720
called the Evija.

34
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.640
And its power comes
from four electric motors

35
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.000
making a total of 2.000 horse power.

36
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.040
As a result. this is nothing less
than the most powerful

37
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.840
production car in the world.

38
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.320
It costs Â£2 million.

39
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.400
The second step of the revival plan
is another model -

40
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.040
the Emira.

41
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.640
This is the more affordable sports
car on which Lotus' future rests.

42
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.440
Senior engineer John Sharp
is part of the crack team

43
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.080
responsible for getting this vital
new car into production.

44
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.920
So. here we have one of the most
confidential places on site.

45
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.440
We're completely locked down.

46
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.760
We don't want anything to do
with this getting out.

47
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.200
Until we reveal to the world
exactly what we're doing.

48
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.640
we need to keep this under wraps.

49
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.080
These cars look like a current Lotus
model but they're not.

50
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.480
Under the familiar skin. it has been
remodelled to fit a brand-new

51
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.760
chassis and engine.

52
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.920
Sometimes on forums you. you might
see a picture of one of these cars

53
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.920
and lots of speculation as to
what's going on and you can

54
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.680
just chuckle away to yourself as to
what everybody's speculating about.

55
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.160
One way to make a new sports car
exciting is with the sound.

56
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.680
LOW HUM

57
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.680
It sounds really good.

58
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.160
It sounds a bit jet fighter.
to be honest.

59
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.120
To power its first new car in ten
years. Lotus has done a deal

60
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.800
with German engine wizards AMG

61
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.800
so that it goes as well
as it sounds.

62
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.040
Old Lotuses were
bought by hard-core enthusiasts.

63
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.520
This new one needs to lure people
away

64
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.120
from other luxury car manufacturers.

65
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.160
To do that.
Lotus has to get the car right.

66
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.560
but it also has to remind
people of its rich history.

67
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.600
Colin Chapman. ex RAF.
ex aircraft engineer

68
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.520
and racing driver
turned car designer.

69
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.400
The company was founded in 1947
by Colin Chapman.

70
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.200
an engineer and innovator every bit
as brilliant as Enzo Ferrari

71
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.600
or Ferdinand Porsche.

72
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.640
One car usually sold as a kit of
parts can be noted here - the Lotus.

73
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.080
Chapman's racing cars
soon started winning

74
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.680
and led the way to British
dominance in F1.

75
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.440
Today. many of these machines
live at the heritage centre

76
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.560
just across the road
from the main factory...

77
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.040
ANSWERS PHONE: Classic Team Lotus.

78
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.040
..cared for by Colin Chapman's
son Clive.

79
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.320
I could look at this all day.

80
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.880
It's just the most fantastic car.

81
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.520
It's the only 72 with its original
specification.

82
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.360
The chassis is all original.

83
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.840
Emmerson won five Grand
Prix in this car.

84
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.120
The black and gold winning
the British Grand Prix.

85
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.720
and my dad throwing his hat
in the air whenever it won a race.

86
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.960
Emerson Fittipaldi wins!

87
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.560
Colin Chapman's cap is in the air.

88
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.720
The list of Lotus' F1 innovations
was endless.

89
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.120
The first monocoque chassis ever...

90
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.040
Engines that were part
of the chassis...

91
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.640
Lightweight cars that painted
themselves to the road.

92
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.560
and active suspension.

93
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.760
And Emmerson's was no different.

94
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.920
The type 72 revolutionised F1 by
putting the radiators on each side

95
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.840
of the driver.
allowing it to be a wedge.

96
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.880
So. the 72 is a wedge shape which.
it's obvious to everybody

97
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.360
is gonna reduce the drag
and improve the airflow.

98
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.520
In particular. it's gonna improve
the airflow to the rear wing

99
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.560
so you're gonna get more
down force.

100
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.400
Recently voted the greatest ever
Formula 1 car

101
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.360
and we're not gonna argue with
that!

102
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.960
Chapman's streamlined racers had
a profound effect on another member

103
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.200
of the Lotus team. the appropriately
named chief designer Russell Carr.

104
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.720
This is a really
important car for me.

105
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.800
because when I was a kid

106
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.680
the type 72 was the racing car.

107
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.760
The famous black and gold colours.

108
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.000
I had no interest in things
like football and other sports.

109
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.000
Formula 1 was my thing.

110
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.760
And this amazing looking car
that was just wedge shaped

111
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.400
and looked so modern.

112
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.760
Of the 40 plus cars that Russell
has worked on.

113
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.040
this one was his first big hit.

114
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.360
This was a very early sketch I did
as part of the Elise programme.

115
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.040
These are just
like little gull wing panels

116
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.960
so it's like getting into
a light aircraft.

117
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.520
So. a combination between a racing
car and a light aircraft.

118
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.800
Russell always knew
he wanted to design cars

119
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.880
but getting there wasn't easy.

120
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.360
I was probably 16 years old.

121
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.360
I went to the careers officer
at school and then they said.

122
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.600
"There's no such job
as a car designer.

123
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.680
"Cars are designed by engineers

124
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.280
"and you're not clever enough
to be an engineer.

125
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.320
"But have you thought about working
at the local water treatment plant?"

126
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.080
Russell bypassed a career in sewage
and for the last 26 years

127
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.520
he's built an impressive career
designing sports cars.

128
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.640
We'll probably make the lower
edge of the car quite dark

129
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.480
just so that it lightens
the vehicle as well.

130
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.480
This line running through
the car's really important

131
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.280
and this line rises and it mimics
the way the air flows into the car.

132
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.960
The all new Emira
is Russell's latest work.

133
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.000
I think it makes a connection
with the Evija hyper car.

134
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.080
so anybody buying this is getting
a little bit of that action

135
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.040
from that car. as well.

136
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.400
Starting with a simple sketch
in Russell's notebook.

137
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.280
the new car's design was then
finessed and refined in 3D.

138
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.560
So. this is part
of the design process.

139
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.280
This blue car isn't a car at all.

140
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.920
It's carefully painted clay.

141
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.080
Clay modellers are incredibly
skilled craftsmen

142
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.760
and they have to have
an artisan skill

143
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.760
to model the surfaces
with extreme accuracy.

144
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.600
And this is what we use
to get the theme approved.

145
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.480
They need to interpret what the
designer wants and turn it into 3D.

146
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.520
When it's heated. it goes soft.
we can spread it onto the model.

147
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.960
and then when it cools
we can work it.

148
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.760
And we use that because it allows us
to adapt the model as things change

149
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.600
so it's a very flexible tool.

150
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.640
The curves and sinews of the new
car's skin try to reflect

151
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.520
the DNA of Colin Chapman's
racing cars.

152
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.080
There's a very well known phrase
in aviation.

153
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.600
"If it looks right. it flies right."

154
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.080
and certainly we think the same
with sports car design.

155
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.040
Creating a brand-new car
is a complicated business

156
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.240
and once the design is signed off

157
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.520
then you've got another challenge -
how to make it.

158
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.760
There's no soulless
mass production here.

159
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.160
Each Lotus is built by hand

160
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.040
and always has been.

161
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.080
That's it. all done.
Looks good. Yeah.

162
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.760
The customer will be really.
really happy.

163
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.200
Lovely. thank you.

164
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.880
Team leader Tracy Cushing
makes the seats.

165
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.280
In a year. we do 1.200. 1.300 cars.

166
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.920
so that's twice as many seats.
but. yeah.

167
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.560
super proud of what
we make in the trim.

168
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.920
This is all handmade.

169
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.760
The seat is probably
the hardest thing to learn.

170
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.440
It's a fantastic product that the
team make day in. day out.

171
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.640
A lot of them have been here
a long. long time.

172
00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.320
So. I'll start off with the arms.

173
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.280
These are the bits that run
down the side of the seat

174
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.160
where you actually
have your seat belt fixing.

175
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.520
The Norfolk-born seamstress
is entering her third decade

176
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.320
for the company.

177
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.760
When I was 16. left school.
got offered a job in a factory

178
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.640
that made jackets and suits.

179
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.920
so it was all the big heavy woollen
fabrics. materials.

180
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.960
And now. sewing leather.
making seats for sports cars.

181
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.080
it's the total opposite.

182
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.920
It's really calming.

183
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.440
it's kind of like my happy place

184
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.160
where I don't have to worry about
anything. I can just sit and sew.

185
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.480
and just enjoy.

186
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.160
Long serving employees like Tracy
have seen a lot of ups

187
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.080
and downs for the company.

188
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.560
There's been money issues.

189
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.560
Lotus do have a bit of a reputation

190
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.000
of having lots
of different management.

191
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.200
lots of changes of management
and it does prove unsettling.

192
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.680
Lotus wants to treble the number
of cars it makes which means

193
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.680
a major rethink for every
single department.

194
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.360
but Tracy remains upbeat.

195
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.000
The company who are looking after us

196
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.080
have poured a lot of investment
into the business.

197
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.560
Staff are really excited
about the future and. yeah.

198
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.000
everybody's really.
really positive again. you know.

199
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.240
Amid the fields of rural Norfolk

200
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.480
lies an enclave of
engineering ingenuity

201
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.400
and cutting-edge technology.

202
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.400
Max Ryan is the prototype
vehicle workshop manager

203
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.080
for the car company's
new flagship. the Evija.

204
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.720
As you can see. it's quite a beast.

205
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.480
This is our halo car. in terms
of the design. the technology.

206
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.400
the power outputs. everything.

207
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.800
This is Britain's first
pure electric hyper car.

208
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.000
Its body is made entirely
from carbon fibre

209
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.680
and it houses the most potent
car battery in the world.

210
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.280
This allows us to run at a maximum
capacity of 2.000 horse power.

211
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.800
We have a lot of the latest
technology inside this battery cell.

212
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.200
I'm not gonna dive into it because
we don't wanna give too much away.

213
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.840
But the Evija isn't going into full
production until later this year

214
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:19.240
and for new MD Matt Windle. his
focus is on the all-petrol Emira.

215
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.240
So this is my uh.
soon to be man shed.

216
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.800
We've recently moved in so I'm just
starting to. as you can see.

217
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.760
get sorted out with the stuff
we have here.

218
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.680
Having worked at Lotus
for over 20 years.

219
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.600
he was appointed MD just last year.

220
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.680
To be MD of Lotus is.
uh. incredible. really.

221
00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.360
I feel responsible for the people
and the history that's gone before.

222
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.400
Matt's rise to the top
has been far from easy.

223
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.680
I came from a single parent family.

224
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.600
Unusually. I grew up with my dad

225
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.760
so that was where my passion of cars
came from because we used to spend

226
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.240
hours and hours and hours going up
to my grandparents in Hartlepool

227
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.200
and all the way up there. I was.
I was quizzing my dad about cars

228
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.240
and I could tell any make of car
by its headlight or its tail light.

229
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.960
And that was just from the amount
of time we spent on the A1

230
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.800
driving up and down in the dark.

231
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.000
I didn't do very well at school and.
yeah. I've just worked hard.

232
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.720
My dad instilled that into me.

233
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.320
Like many at Lotus.
Matt has worked his way up.

234
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.800
He began his career as an apprentice
coach builder.

235
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.040
This is where it all started for me.

236
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.680
So these were
public service vehicles.

237
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.360
So. as you can see.

238
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.880
they're drawn 10th scale.

239
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.520
Drawn by myself in.

240
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.360
in July 1993. so I was 22!

241
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.520
It's been a really difficult
time for Lotus.

242
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.280
Digby. get off my draw...

243
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.960
Ah. no!

244
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I've carried that round
for 30 years.

245
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.000
it's now got dog prints on it.

246
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.600
Over the last couple of decades.
it's been a really difficult time.

247
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.000
Some of the staff have been
there a long time

248
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.680
and have shown real loyalty to the
company and we need to repay that

249
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.600
now by looking after them
and developing the facilities.

250
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.600
The company's first new car in
12 years will more than treble

251
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:47.240
production from 1.500
to over 5.000 cars a year.

252
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.040
This production hall is brand-new.

253
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.720
This is where we can build
the new Emira.

254
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.800
The all new assembly hall is the
size of 1.5 football pitches.

255
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.040
But for Matt. it's the little
things that count.

256
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.960
I don't have OCD.

257
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.080
But uh. I've asked
the production director how.

258
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.040
how they're gonna align
the cars down here

259
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.280
and he's promised they'll be
within three millimetres

260
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.040
so when we look down you'll see
a nice clean line of cars

261
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.360
going down there.

262
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.120
Hi. Phil. how's it going?

263
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.920
Yeah. not too bad. Yeah. come and
show us where we're at.

264
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.320
Although mass production hasn't
begun.

265
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.280
several prototypes are being
worked on

266
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.880
to finesse the production process.

267
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.400
So. this might look
like a strange car

268
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.400
but these here are literally
the first parts that we've received

269
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.160
for Emira. so we're getting them
all checked through this queue.

270
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.840
What that allows us to do is cycle
panels through very quickly.

271
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.080
If we've got a quality issue.
we can see where the problem is.

272
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.800
we'll know if they're good enough to
go to the production line.

273
00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.080
So you can see here.
the left-hand fender.

274
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.880
As first-off parts. these look
very good. very. very good.

275
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.160
We talk about the step up in quality
that we want to make.

276
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.120
This is the investment
we're making

277
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.800
to get that quality we want
on vehicles going forward

278
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.720
so that we get a precision car that
goes together right every time.

279
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.080
But quality isn't the only thing
on Matt's mind.

280
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.680
In four weeks' time. the Emira
will be announced to the world at

281
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.280
legendary motor sport event
the Goodwood Festival Of Speed.

282
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.680
To ensure survival. Lotus is
sticking to Chapman's mantra -

283
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.560
add only lightness and simplicity.

284
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.400
Nothing seems to damage this
amazing material.

285
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.160
You can hammer it. you can
let the kids jump on it.

286
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.800
and it still keeps its shape.

287
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.080
In pursuit of this. Chapman
pioneered the use of the composite

288
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.840
materials that have now become
the norm.

289
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.680
We think that it's only
a matter of time before the vast

290
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.720
majority of cars are built
out of plastic rather than steel.

291
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.480
and therefore this is vital
to our business.

292
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.160
The type 12 chassis frame
weighs just 17kg.

293
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.200
You can pick it up with one hand.

294
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.440
Um. this is the original car.
the prototype.

295
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.280
the very first one.
and we couldn't believe it

296
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.040
when we stripped it down and.
and found it was that light.

297
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.120
A real mantra of this Lotus
and Lotuses after then.

298
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.320
"Never mind the hat." says Graham
Hill.

299
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.040
"I can only just wear the car!"

300
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.600
I think the 12 really captures
the ethos of Lotus today

301
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.600
because it's brave
and it's bold.

302
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.160
Exactly what you want
as the foundations of a race car or

303
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.800
a brand-new road car.

304
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.680
Five miles from the main Hethel
plant.

305
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.880
they're building another factory.

306
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.080
My name's Claire Moxon.
I'm the manufacturing supervisor

307
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.360
here at Lotus Advanced Structures.
and I have a team of 34 general

308
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.680
operatives where we are training
them to build the new Emira model.

309
00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.240
So. this is our chassis
assembly area.

310
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.040
As Lotus embarks on a plan
to build more cars. it's had to

311
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.880
bring in more people.

312
00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.640
I've been steadily recruiting
personnel and training them up

313
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.280
to build cars. A lot of them
have never built a chassis before.

314
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.720
Even supervisor Claire is new.

315
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.720
I am very new
to the automotive industry.

316
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.120
Um. I was in the RAF as an aircraft
technician prior to that

317
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.800
for 22 years. I left the RAF
last July and came to Lotus.

318
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.400
It's been a baptism of fire.

319
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.800
I've slept better in Afghanistan
than I have working for Lotus!

320
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.080
Robots are used to bond
the outer subframe together.

321
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.400
But the more intricate parts
of the chassis are built by hand.

322
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.160
How's it going. guys?
Temperature all right for the glue?

323
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.600
Yeah. Yeah.

324
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.680
So a lot of people don't realise
that we actually glue these

325
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.760
cars - it's lighter than welding.

326
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.000
and actually the adhesive is even
stronger than a welded join.

327
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:11.080
This strength is achieved by baking
the glue at a high temperature.

328
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.960
OK. guys.
let's get the car in the oven.

329
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.440
When the factory is complete.
the process of putting the chassis

330
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.160
in the oven will be automated. but
for now it will be done manually.

331
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.120
Claire's 20 years of military
experience is clearly paying off.

332
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.000
Does that one need to come in
a little bit there?

333
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.280
It looks as if it's going off
to the right there.

334
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.520
What my training
from the military gives me

335
00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.040
is a hard stance on certain things.

336
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.320
Whoa.

337
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.640
But also that we have to nurture
people and we have be supportive.

338
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.120
Like the Incredible Hulk
going in there.

339
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.160
I don't think people realise
how difficult it is to assemble

340
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.520
a car. and the length of time it
takes to train the people to

341
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.160
be able to build that car.

342
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.560
Now the Emira is in the oven cycle.

343
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.480
so we're going to put
that on to 180 degrees

344
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.200
for an hour and a half.
much like a chicken.

345
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.520
With everyone focused on ironing out
any problems to get the new

346
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.600
model onto the production line...

347
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.720
As you can see. there's
a bit of work to be done on this.

348
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.040
..MD Matt Windle has come to inspect
another one of three prototypes.

349
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.160
This is just the body shell.

350
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.800
We use the time now to prepare us
when we're at volume.

351
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.240
Because if you hit an issue
when you're trying to build

352
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.520
at volume. you've got major issues
on your hands.

353
00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.920
But even before production flaws
are ironed out. Lotus is

354
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.080
planning on announcing
the car to the world.

355
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.800
In just three weeks' time.
this Emira will

356
00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.520
make its debut at Britain's most
famous celebration of motor sport.

357
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.840
It's really important for us
that we're at Goodwood

358
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.320
and we will hit those dates.

359
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.080
The problem we've got here
at the moment is we're still

360
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.120
building our current range. so it's
a bit of a jigsaw puzzle to try

361
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.720
and build a new factory
around our current production.

362
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.400
If you think about everything
that we got to achieve. it'd send

363
00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.880
you slightly mad.

364
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.720
When it comes to selling high-end
sports cars. it's not just

365
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.160
looks that will persuade customers
to part with their cash.

366
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.640
They also have to be sold
on the sound.

367
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.440
Noise and vibration engineer
Kirsty Aaron is using an older

368
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.880
model as a benchmark
for the new car.

369
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.560
So this room is a vehicle
semi-anechoic chamber

370
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.480
for noise measurement.

371
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.280
Basically the cones on the walls
stop the noises that we're measuring

372
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.400
being reflected back. which makes
for a more accurate measurement.

373
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.080
People judge the car on what it
looks like to begin with. and

374
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.640
then obviously what it sounds like -
and it's the same

375
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.720
with people. right? You judge
someone and as soon as you see them.

376
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.960
If they're wearing something like
bright or colourful. you're like.

377
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
"Oh. they look a bit funky!" and the
same with your sound as well.

378
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.960
But today it's not the engine noise
that Kirsty's measuring -

379
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.800
it's the indicators.

380
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.920
This is one of the things that
we want to focus on to show that

381
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.080
we're improving on quality.

382
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.880
I'm going to take
a few different measurements

383
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.480
so that we can take an average.
and then we use the objective

384
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.400
and subjective data
to decide where we want

385
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.640
to place our product in terms
of perceived quality.

386
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.480
So Kirsty picks the best sounds
and gets the engineers to copy them.

387
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.480
We basically have a rating
scale of like how we subjectively

388
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.480
assess vehicles.

389
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.840
and it goes from sort of being
like - no-one's going to pick it up

390
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.200
to. like. SOME people might.

391
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.720
REALLY fussy people will.
EVERYONE will. kind of thing.

392
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.080
This one. I'd say is quite a
pleasant noise for an indicator.

393
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.040
But equally. you've got to make it
loud enough that people know

394
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.240
that it's there. just in case
they have to click it off again.

395
00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.840
However you don't want it to be
too loud so that it's offensive.

396
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.560
We've got to up our game
from a quality standard.

397
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.120
If we want to sell cars.
we've got to

398
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.160
be. like. going for the big guns.

399
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.640
To do that. Lotus needs to broaden
it's appeal.

400
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.040
We've been making road cars
in the last 25 years.

401
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.160
But most people associate them
with being very enthusiast-driven.

402
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.520
very track-focused.

403
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.120
Lotus has never been known
for luxurious interiors.

404
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.680
but it's hoping the new car will
change all that.

405
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.720
So this is really a car that.
you know. you can use every day.

406
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.120
We have some really strong
competitors in this market

407
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.840
and so this car is a car without
apologies. without compromise.

408
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.920
It's the most complete Lotus
ever made. I think.

409
00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.920
The huge new investment in Lotus'
bid to improve output

410
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.720
from 1.500 to over 5.000 cars a year

411
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.640
is not without consequence.

412
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.440
As the firm aims to treble the
number of cars it builds.

413
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.280
some of the in-house ways of making
things can't keep pace.

414
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.960
So the work will be outsourced and
those departments shut down.

415
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.520
Hello. Hi. Trace. how are you?
I'm good. thank you.

416
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.760
So we'll go up and have a look
in the engine build first.

417
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.240
OK lovely. thank you.

418
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.400
One of those departments is the
trim shop.

419
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.080
which means workers like
Tracy Cushing will need to find

420
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.200
new roles within the company.

421
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.840
For me personally it is an end
of an era. quite sad.

422
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.960
But for engine supervisor
Mike Antoniades...

423
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.080
OK. if you can run those
volts in please. Tracy.

424
00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.720
..this could be the perfect
opportunity to recruit from within.

425
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.480
Is there a set order to do these or.
is it?

426
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.920
No. you can do them in any order
because we're not tightening

427
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.720
them up at the moment.

428
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.480
Mike's got lots of new roles to fill

429
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.320
and staff from other departments
bring transferrable skills.

430
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.680
It's a ratchet spanner.
which I know you're familiar with

431
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.040
from working in trim.

432
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.400
And just do them up hand tight
please. What. like a torque?

433
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.280
Yeah. that's what you're doing.
exactly.

434
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.280
Are you sure?
Yeah.

435
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.960
Really?
Yeah.

436
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.440
Yep. that's it. cool.

437
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.200
Tracy has spent 20 years
in the trim shop

438
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.440
but. like many. she will
have to adapt

439
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.680
if the company is to move forward.

440
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.240
Yep. that's good.

441
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.960
I bet it could be more fun than
the sewing machine.

442
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.480
It could be my new love. eh?!

443
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.120
That's it. well done.

444
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.640
What do you think of all that. then?

445
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.000
Well. I'll be looking for a job
in here. it's good fun.

446
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.480
It's really good fun.
Good.

447
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.120
So. it's important to do this to
show others in the teams

448
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.360
the challenges that we've all
got in front of us

449
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.480
and the opportunities
we can all take.

450
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.600
And it's not such a scary
world out there

451
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.560
after we finish in the interiors.

452
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.160
We can all do new things.
we can all learn new things.

453
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.120
Carefully prepared engines in
lightweight chassis

454
00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.360
have always allowed Lotus cars to
punch above their weight.

455
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.120
And that was especially
true on the track.

456
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.680
By 1967. Lotus had two F1 world
titles to its name

457
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.720
and was poised to make another
leap into the future...

458
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.240
COMMENTATOR: A shout of victory from
Colin Chapman.

459
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.080
..as the car company's founder
unleashed the Lotus 49.

460
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.640
My father knew how to identify the
people who could build good engines

461
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.400
and he was always on the lookout
for the best source of power.

462
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.880
The Lotus 49 realised the biggest
ever step in performance

463
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.680
year on year in Formula One and
it's never been beaten.

464
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.360
The 49 was designed in conjunction
with the Ford Cosworth DFV

465
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.400
engine. which would go on
to dominate F1

466
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.560
for the next 15 years.

467
00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:01.720
Today. the long term plan for Lotus
is to become an all-electric

468
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.760
carmaker. which means the new
Emira will be the last

469
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.200
internal combustion engine car
they ever make.

470
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.080
In the new factory. another
milestone is approaching.

471
00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.600
There you go mate hold on. Ten?

472
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.960
No. it's a nine. we haven't got a
ten at the moment.

473
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.360
30 year Lotus veteran Simon King
will be mating the 400 horsepower

474
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.000
Emira engine to its chassis on the
shop floor for the first time.

475
00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.360
Exciting but nervous.
you never know.

476
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.000
but. yeah. fingers crossed
it's going to go in.

477
00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.200
Helping Simon will be Andy.
arguably the best man for the job.

478
00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.840
Yeah. yeah best friends. yeah.

479
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.760
Best...best man at his wed...at my
wedding.

480
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.480
Take your T-bar off Andy.
Yeah.

481
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.960
Yeah. we've been working together
20 years so. yeah.

482
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.160
good fun. good fun.

483
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.480
It demands a pair of highly
experienced technicians

484
00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.000
to go through this delicate fitting
of engine to chassis.

485
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.600
So. down. Si.
Down a little bit? Yep.

486
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.040
Little bit more. So. what. go down a
little bit more. Andy?

487
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.560
Hang on. one sec.

488
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.440
Need to go towards you a bit.

489
00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.800
OK. hold on. mate.
How we looking?

490
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.200
Eventually. this fiddly task will
take under 20 minutes.

491
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.720
There you go. Andy. I'm loose now.

492
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.080
Are you in. Andy?

493
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.840
It went in but it ain't coming out!

494
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.920
But for the moment. it's a steep
learning curve.

495
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.960
It's quite a fiddly job and cos it's
so much weight.

496
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.040
it's a lot to jiggle about and. uh.

497
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.560
just to get the bolts in
straight away.

498
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.920
But we'll get there.
We'll get there.

499
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.520
How we doing under there?

500
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.280
Ah. this is a bugger.

501
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.360
There's just no clearance at all.

502
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.920
This trial run will help iron
out the kinks...

503
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.280
Here we go.

504
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.520
..before the factory is at full
chat. making 5.000 cars every year.

505
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.760
Green is good.

506
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.520
Where's me hat?

507
00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.200
Today. it took two and a half hours.

508
00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.480
Good. gents?
Yeah. all good thank you.

509
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.320
Lovely. thank you very much.

510
00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.680
So. yeah. first one. very happy with
and let's move onto the second.

511
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.480
Do you want me to take this wheel
off. Simon?

512
00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.520
Yeah. do you want to jack.
just jack her up? Yeah.

513
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.600
But for many at Lotus.
like Kevin and Simon.

514
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.800
the last combustion engine car is
met with mixed feelings.

515
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.520
Don't know where the string lines
are. do you know where they are?

516
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.560
Um. on the top of my tool box.
Ah. that's all right.

517
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.880
This is. unfortunately. the last
combustion engine car

518
00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.840
that we're going to develop
here at Lotus

519
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.160
and it's a shame. really.
cos we're all. uh.

520
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.520
petrol heads through and through
here.

521
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.760
Go right. I've got that zero
point there Simon.

522
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.840
Bang on 600.

523
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.040
It's the same as the other car.
so... Excellent.

524
00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.840
So. we're spot on with that.

525
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.480
It is the future and you
have to go with it.

526
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.840
It's going to be pretty sad when the
last petrol engine car

527
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.200
comes off the line.

528
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.560
I'll probably be here for the last
of the petrol cars and then

529
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.680
I can slide into retirement and
play with my own petrol cars.

530
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:56.200
The Emira will be shown off to the
world in just two weeks' time

531
00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.480
and everyone at Lotus is beginning
to feel the pressure.

532
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.920
Commercially. for the company this
is such an important product.

533
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.240
So there is a certain trepidation
that you just don't

534
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.680
know how the car's going to be
judged.

535
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.000
For Russell Carr. who led the
Emira's design.

536
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.880
revealing the car at Goodwood has an
added personal resonance.

537
00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.760
So. this is the picture at
Goodwood in 1960.

538
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.080
In the picture here you got Jack
Brabham.

539
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.480
who was then the reigning
Formula One world champion.

540
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.840
Donald Campbell.

541
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.440
Uh. Donald Campbell's wife Tonya
in the background

542
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.360
and there's...there's my father.

543
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.800
So. he worked with Donald Campbell.
who's a very successful

544
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.720
water speed record holder.

545
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.360
And then in 1960. he decided
he was going to go for

546
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.160
the land speed record at
Bonneville Salt Flats.

547
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.000
Russell's father was the project
manager for Campbell's Bluebird -

548
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.520
a land speed record breaking car
that was first shown off

549
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.400
in 1960 at Goodwood.

550
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.280
In front of the car. you can
see Campbell and my father again.

551
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.800
with the famous stand behind there.

552
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.960
I guess a little bit like
we're going to be doing

553
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.440
with Emira fairly shortly.

554
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.080
Vehicles. for both of us. were
important

555
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.960
and I was surrounded by that sort
of passion for vehicles

556
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.640
and thought they were important.

557
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.640
Yeah. it was quite sort of touching.
my dad was quite proud. I think so.

558
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.480
With the assembly line kinks
ironed out.

559
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.080
this new facility will now produce
more cars than ever -

560
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.200
creating hundreds of new jobs.

561
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.120
It's a bit mad. really.

562
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.800
Ten years. this structure's stood
here waiting for this

563
00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.640
production facility to be built.

564
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.400
This is our future here.

565
00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.080
But for the moment. all hands
are on prototype number one.

566
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.440
as Lotus prepare to reveal their new
car to the world's press.

567
00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.040
ENGINE REVS

568
00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.480
CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

569
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.360
But it won't be the journalists
who will determine

570
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.800
if this car is a success or not...

571
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.480
And it's absolutely beautiful.

572
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.240
..it'll be their fans...

573
00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.920
I really like it. actually.

574
00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.040
It's something a little bit
different from Lotus.

575
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.600
..at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

576
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.800
The legendary motor sport
event has arrived.

577
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.800
First stand you see coming to
Goodwood is Lotus.

578
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.040
Big presence and we got a big crowd
here as well.

579
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.040
For Russell. it's almost 61 years
to the day

580
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.360
that his father revealed Bluebird
for the first time.

581
00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.640
I think he would be proud that I'm
doing something that I'm passionate

582
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.960
about and he was a Lotus fan
as well.

583
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
so I'm sure he'd be
really excited.

584
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.240
For years. Lotus have struggled
to make money

585
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.120
but they hope this car
marks a change.

586
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.120
I've had Lotuses for years and
it just looks like

587
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.920
the next generation should do.

588
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.480
And it's not just the die-hard fans
who are impressed.

589
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.960
Ooh. oh. oh!

590
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.840
It just holds the road so well.

591
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.040
We're taking orders as we speak.

592
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.200
It's a fantastic piece of kit.

593
00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.840
For Matt Windle and the team.

594
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.160
Goodwood could not have gone
any better.

595
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.920
Brimming order books
and renewed confidence.

596
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.120
It's where we are as a business.
it shows our progress.

597
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.160
It's the last combustion engine car
we're doing.

598
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.760
so we wanted to make it
best in breed.

599
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.000
It's the most accomplished Lotus
that's ever come out

600
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.280
the gates of the factory.

601
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.400
Buy whether this new car marks
the bright new beginning

602
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.080
everyone craves.
only time will tell.

603
