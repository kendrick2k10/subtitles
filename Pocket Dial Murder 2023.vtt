3
00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:27.027
Hey. love. Don't tell
me you're running late.

4
00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:29.116
You can't do this.

5
00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:31.857
I have enough dirt on you
that I can ruin your life.

6
00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:36.558
You will never get
away with this.

7
00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:39.430
I swear I will tell
her everything--

8
00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:45.219
Jeff?

9
00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:50.702
Jeff?

10
00:00:57.187 --> 00:00:59.015
Hey. You've reached
Jeff Crawford.

11
00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:01.148
Please leave a message and
I'll get back to you soon.

12
00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:04.367
Jeff. What is going on? I
just got a call from you

13
00:01:04.455 --> 00:01:09.460
and all I heard was
screaming and a gunshot.

14
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:11.332
Call me back. I'm
freaking out right now.

15
00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:17.338
Just make sure when you get
home. get lots of rest.

16
00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:24.606
Hey. sis. I just finished
with my last patient;

17
00:01:24.693 --> 00:01:26.477
I was just about to call you.

18
00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:29.132
Joelle. listen carefully.
I need to be quick.

19
00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:30.960
Stacey. you're scaring
me. what's happening?

20
00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:34.529
I just got a call from Jeff;

21
00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:36.618
it sounded like a pocket dial.

22
00:01:36.747 --> 00:01:38.750
I'm 99% sure I heard
a gun shot. I think...

23
00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.406
I think a woman was killed.

24
00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:45.017
Wait. what do you mean?

25
00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:48.108
I don't know. I. I can't
think straight right now.

26
00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:49.848
I haven't heard from
Jeff since lunch.

27
00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:53.591
May...maybe he didn't
have his phone.

28
00:01:53.678 --> 00:01:55.593
I just left him a voice mail.

29
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.595
If he didn't have his phone.
whoever did knows I heard

30
00:01:57.682 --> 00:01:59.380
everything and
could come after me.

31
00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:02.731
Stacey. Call 911 right now.

32
00:02:02.818 --> 00:02:04.559
I can't.

33
00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:06.430
I share my location with Jeff;

34
00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:08.431
they could find me in a second.

35
00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:09.868
Oh my god. OK.
I'm coming over;

36
00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:11.957
I'm calling the
police on my way.

37
00:02:12.088 --> 00:02:15.439
I. I need to turn my
phone off.

38
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.008
911. What's your emergency?

39
00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:22.098
Yes. hi. My name
is Joelle Davrow.

40
00:02:22.228 --> 00:02:25.101
I'm calling on behalf of my
sister. Stacey Crawford.

41
00:02:25.188 --> 00:02:26.841
She thinks she heard a
murder over the phone.

42
00:02:28.017 --> 00:02:29.801
I'm afraid she
could be in danger.

43
00:02:29.888 --> 00:02:30.846
Stacey!

44
00:02:40.638 --> 00:02:42.640
The cops are
on their way.

45
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:44.164
Have you tried
to reach Jeff?

46
00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:47.036
Yes. I called the
office. No answer.

47
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.472
He should have
been home by now.

48
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.695
It can't be Jeff.

49
00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:06.708
OK. So the last time you
spoke to your husband

50
00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:09.711
was at noon today.
and no word since?

51
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:12.801
No. I worked all afternoon
and then I came home

52
00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:15.064
to prepare dinner.

53
00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:16.631
Then. you got a call
from your husband's phone

54
00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:19.677
at 7:35 tonight.

55
00:03:19.764 --> 00:03:21.375
And you're positive
you heard a gun shot.

56
00:03:24.073 --> 00:03:25.466
And you heard no other voices?

57
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:29.165
Just the woman.

58
00:03:34.257 --> 00:03:38.130
I have to ask. Why
do you seem so...

59
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:43.571
so sure that it wasn't your
husband holding the phone?

60
00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:50.230
Stacey? Hey. What's
going on? Hey.

61
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.581
Mr. Crawford? Hi.
I'm Detective Munger.

62
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:55.060
Hi.

63
00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:58.238
Um. listen. before we get
into the events of tonight.

64
00:03:58.368 --> 00:04:01.066
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

65
00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:02.372
You OK?

66
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.767
Mr. Crawford. can
I see your phone?

67
00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:13.035
Um...I'm sorry. I actually
... I don't know where it is.

68
00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:25.134
Hey. You've reached Joelle.
Sorry I missed your call.

69
00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:39.061
Thanks for
everything. Joelle.

70
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:40.889
You can go. I'm OK now.

71
00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:42.325
Are you sure?

72
00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:43.979
I'll call you as
soon as we're done.

73
00:04:50.768 --> 00:04:53.641
So Mr. Crawford. you said
you started your night

74
00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:57.253
with a meeting with a
new client. Harry Kobelt

75
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.604
at StarzCup. and that's the
coffee shop by your office.

76
00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:02.040
and that was from 5 to 6.

77
00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:04.695
Yeah.

78
00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:06.654
Then you went back to
the office for a meeting

79
00:05:06.784 --> 00:05:08.482
with your manager.
Ellen Green.

80
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.746
You work on the weekends?

81
00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:16.272
-Yeah. Ellen just got
promoted to Regional manager.

82
00:05:16.403 --> 00:05:19.884
So we've been doing a
whole lot of reorganization

83
00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:21.973
and overtime for the past
couple weeks. that's all.

84
00:05:29.764 --> 00:05:30.939
I don't know that
I should've left her.

85
00:05:32.114 --> 00:05:33.028
Jeff is with her now?

86
00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:38.816
Joelle. you don't
think that Jeff--

87
00:05:38.947 --> 00:05:39.774
I don't know
anything.

88
00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:44.169
I'm just worried
about my sister.

89
00:05:49.218 --> 00:05:52.177
After Ellen
left the meeting.

90
00:05:52.264 --> 00:05:55.050
was there anyone at the
office who can confirm

91
00:05:55.137 --> 00:05:56.791
how long you stayed?

92
00:05:56.878 --> 00:06:01.099
Uh. no. I was the
only one left.

93
00:06:01.186 --> 00:06:02.666
-At what point
did you realize

94
00:06:02.753 --> 00:06:05.321
that you didn't have
your phone on you?

95
00:06:05.408 --> 00:06:08.193
Maybe five. ten minutes
after Ellen left.

96
00:06:10.413 --> 00:06:12.415
-It seems odd. doesn't it.
that it would take you

97
00:06:12.502 --> 00:06:15.113
that long to realize
it was missing?

98
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.813
No. Um. Ellen was waiting
for me at the office

99
00:06:18.943 --> 00:06:22.207
when I got there. I was late
so I uh. I just dropped all

100
00:06:22.338 --> 00:06:24.862
my stuff with her assistant
and we ran to our meeting.

101
00:06:24.993 --> 00:06:26.690
Now you arrived here at 8.

102
00:06:28.953 --> 00:06:32.130
What were you doing
between 7 and 8?

103
00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:35.525
Um. I was finishing
up some work

104
00:06:35.656 --> 00:06:38.832
and that's when I realized
I didn't have my phone.

105
00:06:38.963 --> 00:06:41.879
So I thought maybe I left
it at the coffee place.

106
00:06:41.966 --> 00:06:44.273
So I went there.
and it was closed.

107
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.102
So I went back to the office
and I looked everywhere for it.

108
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.104
but obviously it was
nowhere to be found.

109
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:52.281
And uh. I packed up my
stuff and I drove home.

110
00:06:52.368 --> 00:06:53.891
About how long
does it take to get

111
00:06:53.978 --> 00:06:55.284
from the office to home?

112
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.721
Uh. like...20 minutes.

113
00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:05.120
OK. Well. I think we're
done here for the night.

114
00:07:05.207 --> 00:07:07.775
So. what are the
next steps here?

115
00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:10.255
Well? We're gonna
track the call and see

116
00:07:10.386 --> 00:07:12.432
if we can find the
area. And once we do.

117
00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:15.870
we'll send a team
out to search.

118
00:07:15.957 --> 00:07:17.872
There's not much
you can do but wait.

119
00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:20.744
Oh. but um. If you
think of anything.

120
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:23.791
here's my card; you'll
give me a call.

121
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:27.185
And Mr. Crawford. I suggest
you don't go too far.

122
00:07:27.272 --> 00:07:28.273
If we do find something.

123
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.885
we're gonna have some
questions for you.

124
00:07:30.972 --> 00:07:34.192
And in the meantime. if your
phone should re-surface.

125
00:07:34.323 --> 00:07:35.585
you'll let us know.

126
00:07:37.326 --> 00:07:38.762
Yeah. Obviously. yeah.

127
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:42.636
All right.
Good night.

128
00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:52.863
Stacey. What did
the police say?

129
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.823
-They're gonna track the call
to see what they can find.

130
00:07:55.953 --> 00:07:58.129
There's nothing more
we can do for now.

131
00:07:58.216 --> 00:08:01.829
OK. Well. I have the
morning off tomorrow.

132
00:08:01.916 --> 00:08:03.961
Want to meet at our spot
in the park at 10:00 am?

133
00:08:04.048 --> 00:08:05.049
-Sure.

134
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.834
I have a few house
showings but not

135
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:07.399
until the afternoon. So...

136
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.792
I'll see you there.

137
00:08:08.923 --> 00:08:11.708
OK. Night. Sis. I love you.

138
00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:20.891
I can't believe
this is happening.

139
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.421
When I answered the call.
my uh. first thought was

140
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.205
that it could've
been Ellen.

141
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:35.210
What made you think it
could have been Ellen?

142
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.864
I knew you were in
a meeting with her.

143
00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.955
You two have been working
a lot of overtime together.

144
00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:42.043
Stacey. come on.

145
00:08:43.697 --> 00:08:45.960
I know where you're
going with this.

146
00:08:46.047 --> 00:08:48.353
There is nothing
between Ellen and I.

147
00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:52.270
The last time you were
working extra hours

148
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:54.446
and ignoring my phone calls.
you said it was nothing

149
00:08:54.577 --> 00:08:55.839
and you were cheating
on me with Catherine.

150
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.103
This time is
different. I swear.

151
00:08:59.234 --> 00:09:01.236
Yeah. this is different
than last time.

152
00:09:01.323 --> 00:09:02.977
It goes way beyond
infidelity or anything

153
00:09:03.107 --> 00:09:04.195
we've ever been through.

154
00:09:06.197 --> 00:09:07.242
I heard a gun shot.

155
00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:12.116
Someone could be dead.

156
00:09:12.203 --> 00:09:18.296
I...I don't know what to
say. OK? This is crazy.

157
00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:21.256
Look. First thing
tomorrow morning.

158
00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:22.866
I'll go back to
the coffee place

159
00:09:22.953 --> 00:09:25.086
and I'll ask to watch
the security cam footage

160
00:09:25.173 --> 00:09:27.479
to see if I can see
who took my phone. OK?

161
00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:31.745
OK.

162
00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:18.095
What are you doing?

163
00:10:18.182 --> 00:10:20.271
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to wake you.

164
00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:23.187
I just need to borrow your
phone to call the office.

165
00:10:23.318 --> 00:10:25.537
Oh. Yeah. OK.

166
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.365
Hey. I made a fresh pot
of coffee downstairs.

167
00:10:27.452 --> 00:10:28.802
Oh. thanks.

168
00:10:45.427 --> 00:10:47.081
Hey. Jeff!

169
00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:49.039
Hey. Morning. Alek.

170
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.301
Joelle told me what
happened last night;

171
00:10:50.388 --> 00:10:53.000
that's insane. I didn't
think you'd be here today.

172
00:10:53.087 --> 00:10:55.219
Nah. I mean I don't exactly
have my mind set to work.

173
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.134
but I gotta figure
out who took my phone

174
00:10:57.265 --> 00:10:58.440
and made that phone call.

175
00:10:58.527 --> 00:11:00.137
Yeah. Where do you
think you lost it?

176
00:11:00.224 --> 00:11:01.399
I don't know; it's
driving me crazy.

177
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.184
I came back here because
I had that meeting

178
00:11:03.314 --> 00:11:06.317
with Harry Kobelt yesterday.
No one saw anything

179
00:11:06.404 --> 00:11:08.276
and they don't have any
camera surveillance inside.

180
00:11:08.406 --> 00:11:10.278
Let me guess. you hadn't set
up your find my phone app?

181
00:11:10.365 --> 00:11:12.628
No. now the phone's
not turned on

182
00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:15.022
so I can't track
it anyway.

183
00:11:15.152 --> 00:11:17.111
Oh. I was supposed
to help Sean

184
00:11:17.198 --> 00:11:19.069
run the new filing
system today.

185
00:11:19.156 --> 00:11:20.288
You got enough on
your shoulders.

186
00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:21.419
I'll take care of that.

187
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.943
Yeah? You just gotta
teach him how to--

188
00:11:23.073 --> 00:11:24.205
Relax. buddy.
I'll handle it.

189
00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:25.336
OK.

190
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.170
Stacey. I got you your
favorite. soy matcha latte.

191
00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:42.353
What is it?

192
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.704
Someone's following me.

193
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.751
You see that girl? I noticed
her when I first got here

194
00:11:48.838 --> 00:11:50.187
and she's been keeping
close ever since.

195
00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:53.016
Let's go.

196
00:11:56.846 --> 00:11:59.240
Did you call
Mom this morning?

197
00:11:59.327 --> 00:12:01.721
She told me she's been
waiting to hear from you.

198
00:12:01.808 --> 00:12:05.594
Not yet. I don't think I'm
ready to tell her about

199
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:08.771
what happened last night;
you know how she is.

200
00:12:08.902 --> 00:12:11.687
Yeah. and she always
reads us so well.

201
00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:15.604
We never know how
she's going to react.

202
00:12:15.691 --> 00:12:17.258
Anyway. it's good not to
put more stress on her.

203
00:12:20.783 --> 00:12:23.220
What did Jeff have to
say about everything?

204
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:25.048
He's on a mission to find out
who could have his phone.

205
00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:30.488
I'm freaking out.

206
00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:32.490
Whoever has his phone
knows I was on the line

207
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:34.231
and heard the gunshot.

208
00:12:37.669 --> 00:12:39.454
Hey.Hey.

209
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.021
I'm done entering these
files into the system.

210
00:12:41.108 --> 00:12:42.109
You have some more?

211
00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:43.850
I sure do.

212
00:12:43.937 --> 00:12:45.503
Yay.

213
00:12:45.634 --> 00:12:47.070
There you go.

214
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.203
Good job.

215
00:12:49.333 --> 00:12:51.031
Oh. thanks. I'm sorry.

216
00:12:51.118 --> 00:12:52.119
Mm hm.

217
00:12:54.686 --> 00:12:56.036
I'm not sure about him.

218
00:12:56.165 --> 00:12:58.125
Ellen. Stop it.

219
00:12:58.212 --> 00:13:00.605
Sean's a good kid.

220
00:13:00.692 --> 00:13:02.651
He's just having a rough time
getting back on his feet

221
00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:06.698
after his parents died.
Plus. he's Alek's nephew.

222
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:09.440
And he's great with technology.
which is exactly what we need.

223
00:13:09.527 --> 00:13:12.052
Ah. All right.
Well. if you say he's good.

224
00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:13.227
then I trust your judgement.

225
00:13:14.576 --> 00:13:15.490
Hey. you know what?

226
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.753
I have no more meetings
scheduled today.

227
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.060
Why don't we skip out a few
hours early and grab a drink?

228
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.279
Oh. um.

229
00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:25.152
I gotta. I gotta
take this.

230
00:13:29.417 --> 00:13:31.332
Jeff Crawford speaking.

231
00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:35.292
Yeah. Mr. Crawford.
Detective Munger.

232
00:13:35.423 --> 00:13:38.121
Wanted to let you know we
were able to trace that call

233
00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:41.298
to an area called Jenkintown.

234
00:13:41.385 --> 00:13:43.344
Are you familiar with the place?

235
00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:45.650
Or maybe you know
someone who lives there?

236
00:13:45.781 --> 00:13:47.391
No. I mean. I know
where it is.

237
00:13:47.522 --> 00:13:49.785
But I haven't been out
that way in a long time.

238
00:13:49.872 --> 00:13:51.439
-Did you get a new cell phone?

239
00:13:51.526 --> 00:13:54.529
No. I am. I am heading
out soon to do that.

240
00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:56.357
Should be by the end of the
afternoon. same number.

241
00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:01.971
Got it. Well...we'll
stay in touch.

242
00:14:02.058 --> 00:14:04.669
OK. Bye.

243
00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:09.196
What was that
all about?

244
00:14:09.326 --> 00:14:10.937
Is there anything
you need to tell me?

245
00:14:11.067 --> 00:14:13.461
We're just dealing with
something that happened

246
00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:15.332
last night. I don't really
want to get into it.

247
00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:17.987
Jeff. I know you were
expecting to be promoted

248
00:14:18.074 --> 00:14:21.295
to Regional Manager. And the
last thing I want is for

249
00:14:21.425 --> 00:14:24.385
things to be awkward between
us because I got the job.

250
00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:27.127
But you can always come
to me about anything:

251
00:14:27.214 --> 00:14:28.389
business or personal.

252
00:14:29.738 --> 00:14:31.740
OK. Thanks. I
appreciate it.

253
00:14:31.827 --> 00:14:33.568
Of course.

254
00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:49.323
Hello?

255
00:14:52.717 --> 00:14:56.983
Oh. it's you. You
scared me for a second.

256
00:14:57.113 --> 00:14:58.854
I'm sorry. I should
have called to let you know

257
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:00.421
I was coming home early.

258
00:15:00.551 --> 00:15:02.379
I uh...

259
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.250
I got a new phone.

260
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.381
Hmm.

261
00:15:06.644 --> 00:15:14.435
You OK? I uh. I've
been the same all day too.

262
00:15:14.522 --> 00:15:16.567
I can't shake the feeling
that someone is watching me.

263
00:15:19.483 --> 00:15:21.442
What? Why would you say that?

264
00:15:23.748 --> 00:15:25.837
I think someone was following
me when I was at the park

265
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.579
with Joelle this morning.
I don't know for sure.

266
00:15:28.666 --> 00:15:31.843
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

267
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:36.457
No. No. no. no. Hey. You're
probably just tired.

268
00:15:36.544 --> 00:15:37.588
I know I am.

269
00:15:40.504 --> 00:15:44.247
Oh. I uh. I talked
to the detective.

270
00:15:44.334 --> 00:15:46.684
They said they tracked the call.

271
00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:48.295
OK. that's good news right?

272
00:15:49.818 --> 00:15:51.211
Yeah. We'll know soon enough.

273
00:16:03.875 --> 00:16:04.876
Inside.

274
00:16:38.954 --> 00:16:40.695
Parker. it's me.

275
00:16:40.782 --> 00:16:44.003
Pull Crawford in for
questioning right away.

276
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.135
Looks like we've got
ourselves a homicide.

277
00:16:57.538 --> 00:17:00.454
Man. they were tough
on you in there.

278
00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:03.979
Hey. But you held
it together well.

279
00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:05.589
Thanks for
everything. Mike.

280
00:17:05.675 --> 00:17:06.460
What are friends for?

281
00:17:06.547 --> 00:17:07.678
Yeah.

282
00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:11.247
Hey. Stacey.

283
00:17:11.334 --> 00:17:12.161
Thank you.

284
00:17:18.253 --> 00:17:24.304
Stacey. they found a
body. You were right.

285
00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:26.609
Somebody was murdered.

286
00:17:26.696 --> 00:17:30.658
I know. Joelle just called
me. It's all over the news.

287
00:17:33.226 --> 00:17:36.620
I can't believe
someone stole my phone.

288
00:17:36.707 --> 00:17:39.841
I have no alibi. Stacey
and... a woman is dead!

289
00:17:39.971 --> 00:17:41.364
I mean. they just
kept asking me

290
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:42.757
the same question
over and over again.

291
00:17:42.887 --> 00:17:44.280
It's obvious they
think I did it.

292
00:17:44.367 --> 00:17:47.501
We both know you
didn't do this.

293
00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:51.853
Mike is a good lawyer. We're
gonna get through this.

294
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.811
Maybe.

295
00:17:53.942 --> 00:17:55.900
Let's go.

296
00:18:24.929 --> 00:18:25.756
Hey.

297
00:18:29.804 --> 00:18:31.849
I'm uh... I'm
heading out early.

298
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.548
I'm gonna go see Mike
before I go to the office.

299
00:18:36.898 --> 00:18:37.855
How are you feeling?

300
00:18:37.986 --> 00:18:40.031
Anxious.

301
00:18:40.162 --> 00:18:42.164
I have a
few showings today

302
00:18:42.251 --> 00:18:43.948
so I hope that'll get
my mind off of things.

303
00:18:46.168 --> 00:18:48.779
Police are investigating
the death of 28-year-old

304
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.043
Juliette Lane. Ms. Lane's
body was found in a cottage

305
00:18:52.174 --> 00:18:55.264
in Jenkintown by a
cleaning service employee.

306
00:18:55.395 --> 00:18:58.354
The cause of death was a
gunshot wound to the chest.

307
00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:01.401
I swear I will tell
her everything that you do-

308
00:19:04.578 --> 00:19:08.495
Seeing her face
makes it all so real.

309
00:19:08.582 --> 00:19:11.454
It's terrible.

310
00:19:37.524 --> 00:19:39.047
Mom. I don't know
what to tell you.

311
00:19:39.134 --> 00:19:41.267
You should just
wait to talk to her.

312
00:19:41.397 --> 00:19:44.052
The last time your sister
stopped taking my calls

313
00:19:44.139 --> 00:19:47.708
was when Jeff was
cheating on her.

314
00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:48.578
Is he cheating again?

315
00:19:48.665 --> 00:19:50.450
Please. Mom.

316
00:19:50.537 --> 00:19:52.234
I knew it. I told her!

317
00:19:52.365 --> 00:19:54.932
If a man cheats once.
he'll do it again.

318
00:19:55.019 --> 00:19:56.760
She thinks her husband is
different from her dad.

319
00:19:56.891 --> 00:20:00.155
Well. I have news
for her. He isn't!

320
00:20:00.286 --> 00:20:04.681
Enough. Mom! Jeff
is nothing like Dad.

321
00:20:04.812 --> 00:20:06.640
Not all men are liars--

322
00:20:06.727 --> 00:20:09.077
Listen to yourself.
you're so naive.

323
00:20:09.164 --> 00:20:11.253
It's a wonder how you
ever became a doctor.

324
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.952
OK. Mom. You've crossed
the line. Again.

325
00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:16.693
I have to go; I'll
call you back later.

326
00:20:20.697 --> 00:20:24.179
Jeff. do you mind?

327
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:28.270
No. No. come. sit down.

328
00:20:28.357 --> 00:20:32.187
I'm not. I'm not sure
exactly what's happening

329
00:20:32.318 --> 00:20:35.712
uh. but a lotta people are
saying some crazy things.

330
00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:38.106
I don't care about the gossip;

331
00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:40.195
I just wanted to make
sure you were OK.

332
00:20:40.326 --> 00:20:46.984
Oh. Sean. It's bad...
-Yeah?

333
00:20:47.115 --> 00:20:49.944
Sean. It is real... real bad.

334
00:20:54.209 --> 00:20:55.819
OK. so I'll get
your paperwork in

335
00:20:55.906 --> 00:20:56.864
and I'll be
in touch.

336
00:20:56.951 --> 00:20:58.431
Perfect.
-Thank you.

337
00:21:04.654 --> 00:21:06.177
Looks like I found
your new neighbors!

338
00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.136
I saw them; they
look perfect!

339
00:21:10.225 --> 00:21:12.793
Hey. I was gonna make my
famous spaghetti tonight

340
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.100
for Alek and Sean. Maybe
you and Jeff could join us?

341
00:21:16.231 --> 00:21:18.015
I can come. but
I convinced Jeff

342
00:21:18.146 --> 00:21:20.017
to go to his
racquetball game.

343
00:21:20.104 --> 00:21:22.672
I figured it could help
get his mind off of things.

344
00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:25.109
I get it. Well. hopefully.
being out of the house

345
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.242
will do you some good too.

346
00:21:34.118 --> 00:21:36.120
Dinner was amazing.

347
00:21:36.207 --> 00:21:37.905
Thanks. Joelle.

348
00:21:37.992 --> 00:21:40.560
Yes. Thank you. it was
just what I needed.

349
00:21:40.647 --> 00:21:41.735
Good.

350
00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:49.177
So. how are you liking
working at ARXB Financial?

351
00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:52.963
Oh. it's...it's awesome.
I like working with Jeff.

352
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.052
He helps a lot of people to
build their dream businesses.

353
00:21:55.183 --> 00:21:59.187
It's a career I can see
myself in for sure. so...

354
00:21:59.274 --> 00:22:01.058
Well. you know you can't
get a job like Jeff's

355
00:22:01.145 --> 00:22:03.887
without going back
to school first.

356
00:22:04.018 --> 00:22:07.064
Yeah. I get that. I'm
not a kid anymore.

357
00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:09.066
so you can stop
treating me like one.

358
00:22:09.153 --> 00:22:12.287
You'll always be a
kid to Alek. I mean.

359
00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:15.812
he raised you most of your
life; it's only natural.

360
00:22:15.899 --> 00:22:19.642
Joelle's right. It's tough.
but you're a man now.

361
00:22:19.729 --> 00:22:20.861
I'll cut you some slack.

362
00:22:22.819 --> 00:22:25.169
I uh. I should go.

363
00:22:25.256 --> 00:22:27.868
Yeah. I have a lot of
work to do tomorrow.

364
00:22:27.955 --> 00:22:29.870
Yeah. you've gotta
impress your boss.

365
00:22:33.961 --> 00:22:36.137
Hey. it was uh. good
to see you. buddy.

366
00:22:36.267 --> 00:22:38.008
Yeah. see ya soon.

367
00:22:43.492 --> 00:22:45.059
So how are you
and Jeff holding up?

368
00:22:46.147 --> 00:22:48.149
We're doing the
best we can.

369
00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:50.804
It's such a nightmare; I
just want it to all be over.

370
00:22:53.284 --> 00:22:55.852
Nightmare is an understatement.

371
00:22:55.939 --> 00:22:57.767
You're smack in the
middle of a murder case.

372
00:22:57.898 --> 00:23:00.074
Honey? Why don't
you grab your iPad

373
00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:02.119
and we can show Stacey some
pictures from our trip?

374
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.860
Oh. Yeah.

375
00:23:09.475 --> 00:23:11.346
I'm sorry. I should have
told him not to bother you

376
00:23:11.477 --> 00:23:13.000
about the case tonight.

377
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:24.315
You would love Montreal.

378
00:23:24.446 --> 00:23:25.316
It's almost like you
could be in Europe.

379
00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:28.189
You guys look so good here.

380
00:23:28.276 --> 00:23:30.365
Thanks.

381
00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:32.106
We could all go
together sometime.

382
00:23:32.236 --> 00:23:33.237
Mm.

383
00:23:44.727 --> 00:23:46.120
No!

384
00:23:50.429 --> 00:23:55.564
Oh my god! It's the
woman who was killed!

385
00:23:55.651 --> 00:23:58.306
Why do you have a picture
of her? Did you know her?

386
00:23:58.393 --> 00:24:01.048
I can't believe this.
I saw her on the news

387
00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:03.964
and I couldn't place
where I'd seen her before.

388
00:24:04.051 --> 00:24:07.184
Where was this photo taken?
How does Jeff know her?

389
00:24:07.271 --> 00:24:09.970
Juliette was one
of Jeff's clients.

390
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.319
This was a photo
taken at a conference

391
00:24:11.406 --> 00:24:13.930
last year in New York.

392
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:15.062
I need to talk to Jeff.

393
00:24:15.192 --> 00:24:16.411
Wait. Stacey. Don't go.

394
00:24:16.498 --> 00:24:19.545
Just take a minute. We
can talk about this.

395
00:24:19.675 --> 00:24:21.764
Sorry. Joelle. I need
to discuss it with Jeff.

396
00:24:25.289 --> 00:24:26.465
Stacey!

397
00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:40.609
Hey. Honey.

398
00:24:40.696 --> 00:24:42.611
Hey. thanks for pushing
me to go to racquetball.

399
00:24:42.698 --> 00:24:44.961
I really think it was
just what I needed.

400
00:24:45.048 --> 00:24:46.310
How was Joelle's dinner?

401
00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:50.837
What's wrong?

402
00:24:50.967 --> 00:24:52.186
You tell me.

403
00:24:54.101 --> 00:24:56.843
I heard this girl get murdered.

404
00:24:56.973 --> 00:24:58.584
You were right next
to me on the couch

405
00:24:58.714 --> 00:25:00.629
when we saw her on the news
and you didn't say anything?

406
00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:04.938
I froze.

407
00:25:05.068 --> 00:25:08.507
I was in complete shock
when I saw her face on TV.

408
00:25:08.594 --> 00:25:10.421
Believe me. I've been
stressing out all day about

409
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.206
how I was going to tell you.

410
00:25:12.336 --> 00:25:13.860
How the police
are gonna react

411
00:25:13.947 --> 00:25:16.558
when they found out
that I knew her.

412
00:25:16.645 --> 00:25:18.299
You haven't told
the detectives yet?

413
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.432
You need to tell them

414
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.173
before they find out
on their own. Jeff.

415
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.175
They're gonna think you're
hiding something from them.

416
00:25:25.262 --> 00:25:27.221
They want me to come down to
the station tomorrow.

417
00:25:27.308 --> 00:25:28.222
I'll tell them then.

418
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:32.443
Were you sleeping with her?

419
00:25:32.574 --> 00:25:37.492
What? No! Stacey!
Absolutely not!

420
00:25:37.579 --> 00:25:39.146
OK? She was just an
old client of mine.

421
00:25:39.233 --> 00:25:40.451
This photo is clearly showing

422
00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:42.279
more than a professional
relationship.

423
00:25:42.366 --> 00:25:45.979
No. We were. we
were...close.

424
00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:47.981
I mean. she was just really
thankful that I helped

425
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:50.549
save her company.
I mentioned her before.

426
00:25:50.636 --> 00:25:52.507
She's the one with the
spa chain. remember?

427
00:25:52.638 --> 00:25:54.509
I haven't spoken a word to
her since we stopped working

428
00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:56.250
together; that was
four months ago!

429
00:25:56.337 --> 00:25:57.947
So why didn't you just say
that in the first place?

430
00:26:01.342 --> 00:26:03.518
I was overwhelmed.

431
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:07.087
I mean. come on. my cell
phone's at a crime scene?

432
00:26:07.217 --> 00:26:08.392
And now I knew
the victim too?

433
00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:12.092
I was worried that you
might not believe me

434
00:26:13.615 --> 00:26:16.618
if I told you that
I knew Juliette.

435
00:26:16.705 --> 00:26:21.275
I mean. Stacey.
Come on. I need you.

436
00:26:21.362 --> 00:26:23.059
I need my wife by
my side for this...

437
00:26:23.146 --> 00:26:25.322
How do you think I felt
when I saw that photo?

438
00:26:25.453 --> 00:26:27.020
I wasn't just thinking.

439
00:26:27.107 --> 00:26:28.935
did my husband have
another affair?

440
00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:33.417
I also thought.

441
00:26:33.548 --> 00:26:36.290
could my husband have
killed this girl?

442
00:26:42.339 --> 00:26:45.386
This is exactly why I
didn't say anything.

443
00:26:45.516 --> 00:26:48.911
I mean. the police already
look at me like I'm guilty.

444
00:26:49.042 --> 00:26:51.522
But now my wife too?

445
00:26:51.653 --> 00:26:55.048
I can't handle that.

446
00:26:55.135 --> 00:26:58.660
I swear to you.
Stacey. I didn't do it.

447
00:26:58.791 --> 00:27:00.923
I never thought you could
cheat on me and you did.

448
00:27:01.054 --> 00:27:03.317
That is not fair.

449
00:27:03.404 --> 00:27:06.668
OK. we were young and
we were in a bad place.

450
00:27:06.755 --> 00:27:09.279
You know me. I'm
not capable of this.

451
00:27:11.847 --> 00:27:13.936
The idea that you could
have an affair is one thing.

452
00:27:20.247 --> 00:27:21.770
But I know you could
never kill someone.

453
00:27:25.469 --> 00:27:28.385
So you have to stop hiding
things from me. I need the

454
00:27:28.472 --> 00:27:30.300
whole truth if we're gonna
get through this together.

455
00:27:32.825 --> 00:27:40.397
I know. I know.
I'm sorry.

456
00:27:40.528 --> 00:27:42.225
God. I love you so much.

457
00:27:42.356 --> 00:27:45.098
I love you too.

458
00:27:45.185 --> 00:27:46.969
Just a lot to process.

459
00:27:49.276 --> 00:27:51.104
I need some time.

460
00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:53.802
Yeah.

461
00:28:11.167 --> 00:28:11.385
Hey.

462
00:28:11.515 --> 00:28:12.516
Hey.

463
00:28:12.603 --> 00:28:14.475
Where are you off
to in such a hurry?

464
00:28:14.605 --> 00:28:15.955
Uh. the police called
me in for questioning

465
00:28:16.042 --> 00:28:18.261
about Juliette's murder.

466
00:28:18.348 --> 00:28:21.612
Ah. I was just with them for a
couple of hours. It was brutal.

467
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.310
What did you tell them?

468
00:28:23.397 --> 00:28:25.312
What do you mean?

469
00:28:25.399 --> 00:28:27.183
We were together the
night Juliette died.

470
00:28:27.314 --> 00:28:29.446
What exactly did you say?

471
00:28:29.577 --> 00:28:31.840
I just want my story
to line up with yours.

472
00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:35.452
Uh. I just told them the truth.

473
00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:39.326
Yes. but if we say
the meeting ran long

474
00:28:39.413 --> 00:28:41.981
then we both
have an alibi.

475
00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:45.245
You're kidding. right?

476
00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:47.551
Yes. Oh. my gosh.

477
00:28:47.638 --> 00:28:51.425
Yes. Of course. I'm
just nervous. Oh.

478
00:28:51.512 --> 00:28:53.383
I already told them yesterday
that I left around 7 pm.

479
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.516
OK

480
00:28:55.646 --> 00:28:56.473
I should get going.

481
00:28:56.604 --> 00:28:57.910
Yeah.

482
00:29:05.526 --> 00:29:07.180
I just don't want to end
up in the same situation

483
00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:08.485
that Mom was in.

484
00:29:08.616 --> 00:29:11.097
She was devastated when
Dad cheated on her.

485
00:29:11.184 --> 00:29:13.926
Do you think I'm crazy for
trusting Jeff right now?

486
00:29:14.056 --> 00:29:15.928
What if he was
sleeping with Juliette?

487
00:29:16.058 --> 00:29:18.495
You and Jeff are nothing
like our parents.

488
00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:21.672
You have such a solid
relationship and...

489
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.111
Yeah. he messed up once.

490
00:29:30.203 --> 00:29:31.552
You should answer that.

491
00:29:31.639 --> 00:29:33.249
Hello?

492
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.295
Hello. is this Stacey Crawford?

493
00:29:35.382 --> 00:29:37.601
Yes. Who am I speaking to?

494
00:29:37.688 --> 00:29:40.343
My name is Meredith Yell.

495
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.998
Juliette Lane was
my best friend.

496
00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:46.915
Oh. I'm so sorry
for what happened.

497
00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:50.179
Me too. There's something I'd
like to talk to you about.

498
00:29:50.266 --> 00:29:52.529
OK.

499
00:29:52.616 --> 00:29:55.576
Can you meet me tonight?
I'll text you my address.

500
00:29:55.663 --> 00:29:58.057
Tonight? Sure. Yes. of course.

501
00:29:58.144 --> 00:29:59.058
Great.

502
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:07.762
That was Meredith. one
of Juliette's friends.

503
00:30:07.893 --> 00:30:10.721
She wants me to meet her
at her place tonight.

504
00:30:10.852 --> 00:30:12.071
I'll go with you.

505
00:30:12.158 --> 00:30:14.595
No. I think she'll open
up more if I go alone.

506
00:30:49.499 --> 00:30:50.065
Hey.

507
00:30:50.152 --> 00:30:51.414
Hey.

508
00:30:51.545 --> 00:30:52.546
You're home early.

509
00:30:52.676 --> 00:30:53.590
Yeah.

510
00:30:53.721 --> 00:30:55.288
How did it go with
the detectives?

511
00:30:55.418 --> 00:31:00.119
Yeah. well. I uh. I told them
about working with Juliette

512
00:31:00.206 --> 00:31:02.991
and of course. they knew. Then.

513
00:31:03.122 --> 00:31:04.775
Then again. they just kept
asking the same questions

514
00:31:04.906 --> 00:31:06.255
over and over again.
like they expected me

515
00:31:06.342 --> 00:31:08.040
to change my answer.

516
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.477
I'm glad Mike was with you.

517
00:31:10.564 --> 00:31:12.609
I'm sure it helped
having a friend there.

518
00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.177
Yeah. He invited me to
racquetball tonight

519
00:31:15.308 --> 00:31:16.962
to get my mind off of it.

520
00:31:17.049 --> 00:31:18.050
Yeah.

521
00:31:18.746 --> 00:31:19.747
That could help.

522
00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:22.489
Mm. I'm just gonna
go grab my. my bag.

523
00:31:28.408 --> 00:31:29.409
That was Meredith.

524
00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:30.584
one of Juliette's friends.

525
00:31:38.374 --> 00:31:39.593
Meredith.

526
00:32:08.274 --> 00:32:09.449
Meredith?

527
00:32:09.579 --> 00:32:10.450
Are you OK?

528
00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:17.196
Oh. my god!

529
00:32:19.285 --> 00:32:20.112
Meredith?

530
00:32:22.418 --> 00:32:26.770
Meredith!

531
00:32:26.857 --> 00:32:30.644
Hey. You're all right. I'm
gonna get you some help. OK?

532
00:32:37.607 --> 00:32:38.739
911. what's your emergency?

533
00:32:38.869 --> 00:32:41.481
Yes. someone has been attacked.

534
00:32:41.568 --> 00:32:43.874
Please send help to 23
Lakeside street. Hurry.

535
00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:44.614
-Help's on the way.

536
00:32:44.701 --> 00:32:45.572
You're OK.

537
00:32:46.747 --> 00:32:48.705
You're OK.

538
00:32:48.836 --> 00:32:52.144
Roberto. Romana.

539
00:32:56.887 --> 00:32:59.325
Roberto Romana?
Who is that?

540
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.676
Meredith?

541
00:33:16.864 --> 00:33:19.649
I called Alek and let
him know what happened.

542
00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:23.523
He's with Sean and neither of
them have heard from Jeff.

543
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.133
I can't reach
him either.

544
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.574
But I just looked up
Roberto Romana online

545
00:33:31.705 --> 00:33:35.709
and it's not a person.
It's a pizza place

546
00:33:35.796 --> 00:33:38.929
in the same area
they found Juliette.

547
00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.889
I wonder what Meredith
was trying to tell you.

548
00:33:41.976 --> 00:33:44.631
I just wish I could
have got there earlier.

549
00:33:44.718 --> 00:33:46.850
There was nothing I
could do to save her.

550
00:33:46.937 --> 00:33:48.548
I'm so sorry. That's awful.

551
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:53.205
I should go.

552
00:33:57.557 --> 00:34:00.821
Stacey. I'm so sorry.
I came as fast as I could.

553
00:34:00.951 --> 00:34:03.302
Are you sure you don't want
to stay with us tonight?

554
00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:04.912
I just want to be home.

555
00:34:04.999 --> 00:34:06.392
OK.

556
00:34:11.527 --> 00:34:13.790
Text me
when you get there.

557
00:34:13.877 --> 00:34:16.750
I will. I love you.

558
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:20.710
I love you too.

559
00:34:53.569 --> 00:34:55.266
How was your meeting
with Juliette's friend?

560
00:35:04.972 --> 00:35:06.843
That's where you were. right?

561
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.454
How did you know
where I was going?

562
00:35:08.584 --> 00:35:09.977
I saw the text that
Meredith sent earlier

563
00:35:10.064 --> 00:35:11.805
when I was at home.

564
00:35:11.935 --> 00:35:14.460
Why didn't
you just tell me?

565
00:35:18.594 --> 00:35:19.987
Meredith's dead.

566
00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:26.385
What did you just say?

567
00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:32.478
I said she's dead.

568
00:35:35.002 --> 00:35:36.438
Someone attacked her
before I got there;

569
00:35:36.525 --> 00:35:37.744
she died in my arms.

570
00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:41.400
That's terrible.

571
00:35:41.487 --> 00:35:42.401
Where were you tonight?

572
00:35:44.794 --> 00:35:46.492
What?

573
00:35:46.579 --> 00:35:48.058
You said you had a
racquetball game with Mike.

574
00:35:48.189 --> 00:35:49.495
But since you've
been unreachable.

575
00:35:49.582 --> 00:35:52.715
I called him. He
said you cancelled.

576
00:35:52.802 --> 00:35:57.981
I uh... I decided
not to go. I just--

577
00:35:58.068 --> 00:36:01.333
I wasn't in the
mood to see anyone.

578
00:36:01.463 --> 00:36:04.249
So I just...I drove around.

579
00:36:06.207 --> 00:36:08.775
And I debated following
you to Meredith's

580
00:36:08.862 --> 00:36:11.908
or just coming home.

581
00:36:12.039 --> 00:36:13.606
Meredith was supposed to
tell me something that I

582
00:36:13.693 --> 00:36:15.521
needed to know
about the call.

583
00:36:15.651 --> 00:36:17.044
about Juliette or
maybe about you.

584
00:36:17.131 --> 00:36:18.524
And now she's dead.

585
00:36:18.611 --> 00:36:20.917
And once again. you can't
prove where you were?

586
00:36:21.004 --> 00:36:23.006
Are you seriously
suggesting

587
00:36:23.093 --> 00:36:24.660
that I had something
to do with it?

588
00:36:24.747 --> 00:36:26.619
I don't know what
to think anymore.

589
00:36:26.706 --> 00:36:27.185
Stacey.

590
00:36:27.272 --> 00:36:29.578
Don't do it.

591
00:36:29.665 --> 00:36:30.449
Stacey. come on.

592
00:36:36.977 --> 00:36:38.892
Are you scared of me?

593
00:36:42.809 --> 00:36:45.072
I can't trust anything right
now. including you. Jeff.

594
00:36:48.902 --> 00:36:51.644
Stacey. Don't say that.

595
00:36:57.824 --> 00:36:59.391
I'm gonna sleep in
the guest bedroom.

596
00:37:55.838 --> 00:37:57.797
Here we go.

597
00:37:59.102 --> 00:38:00.626
Hi.

598
00:38:00.756 --> 00:38:01.975
I was wondering
if I could ask you

599
00:38:02.062 --> 00:38:03.498
a couple of
questions.

600
00:38:03.585 --> 00:38:05.326
My name is
Stacey Crawford.

601
00:38:05.457 --> 00:38:07.110
I'm Selena.

602
00:38:07.241 --> 00:38:09.635
I think you may have
known Meredith Yell?

603
00:38:09.722 --> 00:38:11.985
She told me to come here.
I'm trying to find out why.

604
00:38:12.072 --> 00:38:14.248
I'm sorry I don't
know a Meredith Yell.

605
00:38:14.335 --> 00:38:16.032
Can you please just
tell me if you recognize

606
00:38:16.119 --> 00:38:17.773
anyone in
these photos?

607
00:38:17.904 --> 00:38:25.564
Um...oh. I know this girl.

608
00:38:25.651 --> 00:38:26.826
She was killed not
too long ago.

609
00:38:26.956 --> 00:38:28.697
You knew her?

610
00:38:28.828 --> 00:38:31.134
I mean. she was a customer
here. She would come

611
00:38:31.221 --> 00:38:33.963
pretty often. usually alone.
sometimes with her boyfriend.

612
00:38:37.358 --> 00:38:40.100
Although once she came
in with another woman

613
00:38:40.187 --> 00:38:43.277
and they caused a scene
with a big argument.

614
00:38:43.364 --> 00:38:47.673
You said she came in with a
boyfriend. It's not this man?

615
00:38:50.153 --> 00:38:54.027
Um. It's hard to
tell. It could be.

616
00:38:54.114 --> 00:38:55.898
I didn't really get
a good look at him.

617
00:38:56.029 --> 00:38:58.640
He usually wore a hat so
it hid most of his face.

618
00:38:58.727 --> 00:38:59.859
I'm sorry; I should
get back to work.

619
00:38:59.946 --> 00:39:01.774
One last question:

620
00:39:01.861 --> 00:39:04.646
do you know the woman
Juliette was arguing with?

621
00:39:04.733 --> 00:39:06.866
No. I'm sorry I
couldn't help.

622
00:39:16.963 --> 00:39:21.184
Darn it. I'm out
of storage.

623
00:39:21.315 --> 00:39:22.621
I keep forgetting to
take that hard drive

624
00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:24.057
Jeff offered me.

625
00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:28.017
Have you heard from
Stacey this morning?

626
00:39:28.148 --> 00:39:30.585
No. She
needs her rest.

627
00:39:30.672 --> 00:39:33.719
so I'm gonna wait
a bit to call.

628
00:39:33.806 --> 00:39:36.069
I'm seeing her later
with Mom anyways.

629
00:39:36.156 --> 00:39:38.506
Yeah. She definitely
needs her rest.

630
00:39:38.637 --> 00:39:40.116
This whole situation
with her and Jeff

631
00:39:40.203 --> 00:39:42.771
is getting pretty crazy.
You should hear some of

632
00:39:42.858 --> 00:39:45.600
the gossip going around
the office right now.

633
00:39:45.687 --> 00:39:48.124
Do people actually believe
he killed Juliette?

634
00:39:48.211 --> 00:39:49.996
Some of them are saying
that she might have been

635
00:39:50.126 --> 00:39:51.214
his mistress and he
might have killed her

636
00:39:51.301 --> 00:39:53.303
so Stacey wouldn't find out.

637
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:54.653
Why would people think
Jeff and Juliette

638
00:39:54.783 --> 00:39:56.176
were having an affair?

639
00:39:56.306 --> 00:39:57.873
It's an accumulation of things.

640
00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.528
Juliette was bringing
him gifts. lunches.

641
00:40:00.615 --> 00:40:03.096
following him to conferences.

642
00:40:03.183 --> 00:40:06.099
The rumors probably wouldn't
be this bad if she hadn't

643
00:40:06.229 --> 00:40:08.101
asked for her file to
be transferred to Jeff.

644
00:40:10.756 --> 00:40:12.453
So she was working with
someone else before Jeff?

645
00:40:12.584 --> 00:40:13.628
-Mm.

646
00:40:13.715 --> 00:40:14.673
Who?

647
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.283
Ellen.

648
00:40:19.895 --> 00:40:21.767
The gossip's only gonna get
worse once they find out

649
00:40:21.854 --> 00:40:23.159
that Juliette's
friend was murdered

650
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.553
and that Jeff doesn't
have an alibi again.

651
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.860
Oh God. That's
brutal. Poor Jeff!

652
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:41.003
You seem very
preoccupied. honey.

653
00:40:41.134 --> 00:40:43.136
Are you finally going to
tell me what's going on?

654
00:40:43.223 --> 00:40:46.879
I know something is wrong.

655
00:40:46.966 --> 00:40:51.013
You're right. we've been
keeping something from you.

656
00:40:51.144 --> 00:40:53.538
I knew it. Why am I
always the last to know?

657
00:40:53.668 --> 00:40:54.800
This is serious. Mom.

658
00:40:56.932 --> 00:40:59.021
Before I tell you. I need to
be sure you're gonna listen

659
00:40:59.152 --> 00:41:01.894
to me without
interrupting or judging.

660
00:41:04.505 --> 00:41:09.249
On Sunday night. I
got a phone call.

661
00:41:19.389 --> 00:41:21.043
Uh. I didn't expect
anybody to be in here.

662
00:41:22.958 --> 00:41:25.047
What are you doing
in Alek's office?

663
00:41:25.178 --> 00:41:28.224
Wh.. Alek's out for lunch.
and he uh. he told me

664
00:41:28.355 --> 00:41:31.358
I could use his computer. so.

665
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.578
OK. well. I just
came to grab a file.

666
00:41:33.708 --> 00:41:34.753
Mm hm. Yeah.

667
00:41:37.364 --> 00:41:39.235
You're getting pretty
comfortable here.

668
00:41:39.322 --> 00:41:41.586
Jeff says you've been doing
some really good work.

669
00:41:41.716 --> 00:41:44.458
Uh. thanks. Thanks.

670
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:46.329
-You know. I mentioned to
Jeff it might be a good idea

671
00:41:46.416 --> 00:41:48.027
to take some time off.

672
00:41:48.157 --> 00:41:50.986
So you may work directly
under your uncle.

673
00:41:51.117 --> 00:41:56.426
Uh. I'd rather
um. not.

674
00:41:56.557 --> 00:41:58.951
Alek bosses me around
enough in my normal life;

675
00:41:59.038 --> 00:42:00.126
I don't need it
at work too.

676
00:42:03.129 --> 00:42:04.652
Yes. I can understand that.

677
00:42:18.231 --> 00:42:20.233
I told you years ago you
should have left him.

678
00:42:20.363 --> 00:42:21.800
He's just like
your father!

679
00:42:21.887 --> 00:42:23.236
Nothing but a liar
and a cheater!

680
00:42:23.323 --> 00:42:24.629
Mom. stop!

681
00:42:24.759 --> 00:42:27.153
You don't get to tell me
when I can and can't talk.

682
00:42:31.505 --> 00:42:35.161
I did my best to raise you
girls well. to protect you

683
00:42:35.248 --> 00:42:38.251
so that you'd never
get hurt the way I did.

684
00:42:38.381 --> 00:42:41.820
And look
what I get in return.

685
00:42:41.907 --> 00:42:44.474
You always think you
know better. you...

686
00:42:44.605 --> 00:42:47.956
you just see me as a.
a bitter old woman.

687
00:42:48.087 --> 00:42:50.306
You never even bother
to consider my advice.

688
00:42:50.393 --> 00:42:52.961
Look at you now. You're
still married to a man

689
00:42:53.048 --> 00:42:54.615
who is about to destroy
your life with his lies.

690
00:42:54.746 --> 00:42:56.704
That's enough. Mom!

691
00:42:56.791 --> 00:42:59.011
This is exactly why I
didn't want to tell you.

692
00:42:59.098 --> 00:43:00.752
I always expect you
to be supportive

693
00:43:00.839 --> 00:43:03.232
and you disappoint
me every time.

694
00:43:03.319 --> 00:43:06.453
You need to be smart. Stacey.
Instead of pining for a man

695
00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:07.802
who is keeping another
woman's bed warm.

696
00:43:07.933 --> 00:43:09.021
Stop it!

697
00:43:10.326 --> 00:43:11.937
Jeff is nothing like Dad.

698
00:43:13.416 --> 00:43:15.331
You need to swallow
your pride and realize

699
00:43:15.418 --> 00:43:18.334
that my relationship is
different than yours was!

700
00:43:23.992 --> 00:43:26.212
I think it would be best if
you left and we can continue

701
00:43:26.342 --> 00:43:27.909
this conversation when you're
ready to be supportive.

702
00:43:32.653 --> 00:43:35.003
Oh. God.

703
00:43:35.134 --> 00:43:36.004
Oh. Mom.

704
00:43:36.091 --> 00:43:37.397
Mom?

705
00:43:38.398 --> 00:43:40.008
I got you.

706
00:43:40.095 --> 00:43:41.706
What's happened?

707
00:43:41.793 --> 00:43:42.837
I got you. It's OK.

708
00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:45.797
It's OK. just breathe.
It's OK. I got you.

709
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:49.757
Thank you for taking
such good care of her.

710
00:43:54.196 --> 00:43:57.112
She's gonna be OK.
She just needs some rest.

711
00:43:57.199 --> 00:43:58.766
-This is all
my fault.

712
00:43:58.853 --> 00:43:59.811
I should've never
acted like that.

713
00:43:59.898 --> 00:44:02.161
I just couldn't handle
hearing Mom talk about

714
00:44:02.291 --> 00:44:03.379
how Jeff has lied
to me before and--

715
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:04.816
Stop blaming
yourself.

716
00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:07.819
She's OK.

717
00:44:09.385 --> 00:44:10.952
I know.

718
00:44:12.562 --> 00:44:15.087
I just feel so tired.

719
00:44:15.174 --> 00:44:19.352
Deep down. I don't think
Jeff is capable of murder.

720
00:44:19.439 --> 00:44:21.571
But with everything stacked
against him. I don't want

721
00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:24.052
to be one of those stupid
girls blinded by love.

722
00:44:24.139 --> 00:44:29.667
You are not stupid. and
you know your husband.

723
00:44:29.797 --> 00:44:35.020
Just listen to your heart and
leave all of those details

724
00:44:35.107 --> 00:44:38.153
to Mike and the police.

725
00:44:38.284 --> 00:44:41.156
Thanks. Jo.
You're right.

726
00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:48.947
I can't believe
Stacey didn't call

727
00:44:49.077 --> 00:44:50.905
to tell me
about Madeline.

728
00:44:50.992 --> 00:44:52.515
I told Joelle I
was with you so.

729
00:44:52.646 --> 00:44:54.343
Stacey knew I'd
let you know.

730
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.911
Well. Still.

731
00:44:56.998 --> 00:44:59.218
I know. This is
a lot for Stacey.

732
00:44:59.305 --> 00:45:03.701
Adding to what happened last
night...she was a wreck.

733
00:45:03.831 --> 00:45:10.011
This whole thing is a mess.
She's barely talking to me.

734
00:45:10.098 --> 00:45:12.057
I don't know what to do anymore
to make her believe me.

735
00:45:13.928 --> 00:45:19.325
Alek. I'm losing her.

736
00:45:19.412 --> 00:45:21.980
Maybe...maybe being
home more will help.

737
00:45:30.292 --> 00:45:33.034
Jeff. Can I see you
in my office. please?

738
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:34.906
Uh. yeah. Yeah. sure.

739
00:45:42.217 --> 00:45:45.220
So I hear you're finally
taking my advice?

740
00:45:45.307 --> 00:45:47.092
Yeah. I'm gonna take the
afternoon and finalize

741
00:45:47.179 --> 00:45:49.442
some paperwork and
then heading out.

742
00:45:49.572 --> 00:45:52.271
Mm. It's gonna be weird
not having you around.

743
00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:59.278
There's something I need to
tell you about Juliette and I.

744
00:45:59.365 --> 00:46:02.281
When I was handling her
file. something went wrong.

745
00:46:04.196 --> 00:46:04.892
What do you mean?

746
00:46:09.505 --> 00:46:11.551
I made a
calculation mistake;

747
00:46:11.638 --> 00:46:14.336
I was fixing it. but
when she found out.

748
00:46:14.467 --> 00:46:17.905
she accused me of trying
to sabotage her company.

749
00:46:18.036 --> 00:46:20.516
Were you? Trying
to sabotage her?

750
00:46:20.603 --> 00:46:23.215
No. Of course not! But...

751
00:46:24.738 --> 00:46:27.132
This happened just after they
announced the opening for

752
00:46:27.262 --> 00:46:30.004
Regional Manager and I was
blinded by getting the title.

753
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:32.311
I didn't think twice. I
offered Juliette money

754
00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:34.617
to buy her silence because I
didn't want the situation

755
00:46:34.748 --> 00:46:37.185
to leave a black mark on my
career and spoil my chances

756
00:46:37.272 --> 00:46:38.578
for the promotion.

757
00:46:42.321 --> 00:46:46.020
Wow. So did she
take the money?

758
00:46:46.107 --> 00:46:48.414
No. She just dropped
me and asked you

759
00:46:48.544 --> 00:46:50.764
to handle her business plans.

760
00:46:50.895 --> 00:46:52.810
Well. so why are you. why are
you telling me all of this?

761
00:46:54.942 --> 00:46:58.337
The police have her cell
phone and her laptop.

762
00:46:58.467 --> 00:47:00.165
I'm not sure if she still
has our email exchanges.

763
00:47:00.295 --> 00:47:02.994
But if she does. I
could be in trouble.

764
00:47:05.735 --> 00:47:09.348
Hold on. You haven't
told the police?

765
00:47:09.478 --> 00:47:13.134
Ellen. Are you kidding me?

766
00:47:13.221 --> 00:47:14.701
I'm being accused of murder
here. and you're sitting

767
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:16.268
on information
that could help me?

768
00:47:16.355 --> 00:47:17.530
Jeff. It's not that simple.

769
00:47:17.617 --> 00:47:19.445
Oh. no. But it is!

770
00:47:19.575 --> 00:47:21.360
You lied to the police and
now you want me to help you.

771
00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.365
I'm sorry. but uh. I'm
gonna tell them everything.

772
00:47:33.241 --> 00:47:36.462
You'll regret not accepting
my offer for an alibi.

773
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:38.029
You can leave now.

774
00:47:58.963 --> 00:48:01.530
Mom's not
that young anymore.

775
00:48:01.617 --> 00:48:03.445
Seeing her so fragile
on her hospital bed

776
00:48:03.576 --> 00:48:08.189
made me realize she won't
be with us forever.

777
00:48:08.276 --> 00:48:09.625
But I want to finish
the conversation

778
00:48:09.712 --> 00:48:11.323
we started with her.

779
00:48:14.413 --> 00:48:17.329
We didn't even get to
tell her about the murder.

780
00:48:17.416 --> 00:48:20.071
She deserves to know
that Jeff is a suspect.

781
00:48:22.987 --> 00:48:27.208
Always tip toeing around
her because of her anxiety.

782
00:48:27.339 --> 00:48:29.123
But you're right.

783
00:48:29.254 --> 00:48:30.603
She needs to know what
you're going through.

784
00:48:33.301 --> 00:48:35.129
I'm sure. once she understands

785
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.873
the whole situation.
she'll be supportive.

786
00:48:40.004 --> 00:48:44.095
Mom is strong. She still has
many years ahead of her.

787
00:48:44.182 --> 00:48:46.401
Yeah. She's
far too stubborn

788
00:48:46.532 --> 00:48:47.663
to go before she's ready.

789
00:48:50.536 --> 00:48:52.755
She was so worried about what
the police might find out.

790
00:48:52.886 --> 00:48:54.975
I mean. she must be
hiding something.

791
00:48:55.062 --> 00:48:56.803
Like what?

792
00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:59.240
I'm not sure. But
I gotta find out.

793
00:48:59.327 --> 00:49:01.155
This could be a way to get
the police off my back.

794
00:49:01.242 --> 00:49:02.809
Mm.

795
00:49:02.896 --> 00:49:06.247
Hey. do you...do you
think maybe Sean would...

796
00:49:06.378 --> 00:49:07.683
hack into Ellen's e-mails if I-

797
00:49:07.814 --> 00:49:09.598
Absolutely not.

798
00:49:09.685 --> 00:49:11.774
There's no way I'm gonna
let my nephew take the risk.

799
00:49:11.861 --> 00:49:13.428
He could get sued
if he gets caught.

800
00:49:13.515 --> 00:49:15.039
Could end up with
a criminal record.

801
00:49:15.169 --> 00:49:17.302
No. Sorry. You're right.

802
00:49:17.389 --> 00:49:19.434
That's all right.

803
00:49:19.521 --> 00:49:21.132
There's gotta be another
way to find out without you

804
00:49:21.219 --> 00:49:23.134
getting in more trouble. right?

805
00:49:23.264 --> 00:49:25.179
You've got enough
of that as it is.

806
00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:27.965
Yeah. Yeah.

807
00:49:31.577 --> 00:49:32.882
We should be getting
back to the hospital.

808
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:37.496
Yeah. Oh. uh. before we go. can
I grab that extra hard drive?

809
00:49:37.626 --> 00:49:39.150
Sure. you can check
Jeff's office.

810
00:49:39.237 --> 00:49:40.064
Thanks.

811
00:50:02.434 --> 00:50:03.174
Did you find it?

812
00:50:14.359 --> 00:50:18.363
Oh. my God. No.

813
00:50:29.591 --> 00:50:31.289
All right. ladies.

814
00:50:31.419 --> 00:50:32.768
We've done a complete
search of the house

815
00:50:32.855 --> 00:50:34.683
so that's gonna
be all for today.

816
00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:37.904
Is Jeff going to be arrested?

817
00:50:37.991 --> 00:50:41.255
Nothing's gonna happen
before we run some tests

818
00:50:41.386 --> 00:50:43.866
on the bullet that
killed Juliette Lane.

819
00:50:43.953 --> 00:50:45.694
To make sure it
came from that gun.

820
00:50:45.781 --> 00:50:49.263
Is it safe for
Stacey to stay here?

821
00:50:49.394 --> 00:50:50.743
I think Ms. Crawford
is the only one

822
00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:52.136
that can make that decision.

823
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:54.747
Ladies.

824
00:50:57.619 --> 00:50:59.708
I'm gonna stay here.
-Stacey.

825
00:50:59.839 --> 00:51:01.101
Go pick up Mom.
I'll call you later.

826
00:51:02.189 --> 00:51:04.539
You should come and
stay at Mom's too.

827
00:51:05.801 --> 00:51:07.064
I'm fine.

828
00:51:14.854 --> 00:51:15.855
Hey. You wanted to see me?

829
00:51:15.985 --> 00:51:16.769
Yeah. yeah. Come on in.

830
00:51:16.899 --> 00:51:17.726
Grab a seat.

831
00:51:22.688 --> 00:51:24.124
Oh. do you mind uh.
closing the door?

832
00:51:24.255 --> 00:51:25.430
Yeah. yeah.

833
00:51:30.522 --> 00:51:33.525
What's up?

834
00:51:33.655 --> 00:51:36.528
Alek doesn't want me talking
to you about this. OK?

835
00:51:36.658 --> 00:51:38.747
So can we keep it between us?

836
00:51:38.834 --> 00:51:40.575
Yeah. yeah. Yeah.

837
00:51:40.662 --> 00:51:46.451
Um. I need your
help with something.

838
00:51:46.538 --> 00:51:49.671
Well. I'm not great with
computers. And I know you are.

839
00:51:52.718 --> 00:51:56.504
I need to talk to Mr.
Crawford... in private.

840
00:51:56.591 --> 00:51:58.376
Um.

841
00:51:58.463 --> 00:52:00.204
It's OK.

842
00:52:00.334 --> 00:52:02.728
Cool.

843
00:52:02.815 --> 00:52:03.642
Thanks. Sean.

844
00:52:03.772 --> 00:52:05.644
Yeah. Yeah.

845
00:52:07.994 --> 00:52:10.257
Mr. Crawford.

846
00:52:10.388 --> 00:52:11.954
Detective Munger.

847
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:14.609
We got a call this
afternoon from your wife.

848
00:52:17.525 --> 00:52:20.702
She found your old cell
phone in your home office.

849
00:52:20.833 --> 00:52:23.662
Next to a gun.

850
00:52:23.792 --> 00:52:29.798
You-you're serious.
That's impossible.

851
00:52:29.885 --> 00:52:31.713
Detective. I don't even own
a gun. Stacey knows that.

852
00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.801
I'm sure she told you!

853
00:52:32.888 --> 00:52:36.065
We'll let the experts
determine that.

854
00:52:36.196 --> 00:52:38.503
You know. they're gonna
need a little time to see

855
00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:40.374
if the gun they found
matches the bullet

856
00:52:40.461 --> 00:52:42.376
that killed Juliette Lane.

857
00:52:42.463 --> 00:52:46.685
But if it does. you'll
hear from us soon enough.

858
00:52:46.815 --> 00:52:49.949
What does that mean?

859
00:52:50.036 --> 00:52:58.610
It just means uh. stick
around. Don't leave town.

860
00:53:17.759 --> 00:53:22.068
So. are you gonna join
us for a sleepover?

861
00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:25.898
I don't think so. I
need to face Jeff.

862
00:53:31.904 --> 00:53:36.300
Stacey. You cannot
stay there alone.

863
00:53:38.911 --> 00:53:41.218
He just got home.
I'll call you back.

864
00:53:41.305 --> 00:53:43.176
I'm calling Alek right now
so he can be there with you.

865
00:53:47.876 --> 00:53:49.617
Hey. listen you've gotta
believe me when I tell you--

866
00:53:49.748 --> 00:53:52.968
I trusted you! I defended you!
-Hey.

867
00:53:53.055 --> 00:53:55.493
Don't touch me! Since when do
you keep a gun in our house?

868
00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.408
That wasn't my gun!

869
00:53:57.495 --> 00:53:59.323
Stacey. I don't even own
a gun! You know that!

870
00:53:59.453 --> 00:54:00.933
Come on. I swear. I'm
getting framed here!

871
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.587
Do you know how
insane that sounds?

872
00:54:02.717 --> 00:54:03.805
I'm telling the truth. OK?

873
00:54:03.936 --> 00:54:05.546
Somebody must have
planted that gun

874
00:54:05.677 --> 00:54:07.505
and my cell phone in my office.

875
00:54:07.635 --> 00:54:10.682
The same way someone brought
your phone to a crime scene?

876
00:54:10.812 --> 00:54:13.859
Or how you were unreachable
the night that Meredith died?

877
00:54:13.946 --> 00:54:15.861
Stacey. please. Just listen.

878
00:54:15.991 --> 00:54:18.994
Today I decided to fight for
you. Like an idiot. I decided

879
00:54:19.081 --> 00:54:22.041
to ignore everything pointed
against you. I told myself

880
00:54:22.128 --> 00:54:24.870
over and over again that
you couldn't have possibly

881
00:54:24.957 --> 00:54:26.437
done this. And now...

882
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:32.269
I can't live under
the same roof as you.

883
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.448
I think you should leave.

884
00:54:37.535 --> 00:54:38.623
You can pack a suitcase and

885
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:41.408
come get the rest of
your stuff another day.

886
00:54:41.495 --> 00:54:43.628
And just so you know.

887
00:54:43.715 --> 00:54:45.760
I called Joelle and
Alek is on the way.

888
00:54:45.847 --> 00:54:52.593
Stacey. you know
I would never hurt you.

889
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.378
You already have.

890
00:55:20.186 --> 00:55:22.797
Hey. I just got a
call from Joelle.

891
00:55:22.928 --> 00:55:25.234
I know why you're here.

892
00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:31.589
Just um. take good care
of Stacey for me. Please.

893
00:55:31.719 --> 00:55:34.548
And listen. I'm gonna
make sure she knows

894
00:55:34.635 --> 00:55:35.941
she was right to trust me.

895
00:55:52.958 --> 00:55:55.787
Stacey. It's Alek.

896
00:55:58.355 --> 00:56:00.574
Hey. I'm so sorry
about everything.

897
00:56:00.705 --> 00:56:02.097
Joelle just called
for me to check on you

898
00:56:02.184 --> 00:56:03.708
I know. she told me.

899
00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.496
Stacey?

900
00:56:09.583 --> 00:56:10.802
I was just about to
call you.

901
00:56:10.889 --> 00:56:13.457
OK. good. Are you OK?

902
00:56:13.587 --> 00:56:17.504
Jeff just left and Alek is here.

903
00:56:17.591 --> 00:56:19.114
I think we should
wait to tell Mom

904
00:56:19.201 --> 00:56:21.856
until I can be there.
I want to do it myself.

905
00:56:21.987 --> 00:56:23.336
I'm just gonna relax for a bit.

906
00:56:23.467 --> 00:56:24.946
and I'll come over later.

907
00:56:25.077 --> 00:56:26.731
Call if you need
anything. Love you.

908
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:29.211
OK. Bye.

909
00:56:29.298 --> 00:56:31.126
Thanks for coming over.

910
00:56:31.213 --> 00:56:32.867
Yeah. of course. Do you
want me to stay or...?

911
00:56:32.954 --> 00:56:36.044
No. Thanks. I'll...I'll be OK.

912
00:56:36.175 --> 00:56:38.960
All right. if you're sure.

913
00:56:39.091 --> 00:56:40.484
You know I'm just
a phone call away

914
00:56:40.571 --> 00:56:42.703
if you need anything. right?

915
00:56:50.537 --> 00:56:53.540
All right.

916
00:57:21.786 --> 00:57:24.441
I have no alibi.
Stacey. a woman is dead.

917
00:57:28.053 --> 00:57:29.750
I was worried that
you might not believe me

918
00:57:29.881 --> 00:57:31.099
if I told you that
I knew Juliette.

919
00:57:34.146 --> 00:57:38.063
I decided not to go. So
I just...I drove around.

920
00:58:59.927 --> 00:59:06.281
Jeff! Jeff! What
are you doing?

921
00:59:06.412 --> 00:59:08.545
I know you found
out my secret.

922
00:59:12.679 --> 00:59:15.160
You killed Juliette?

923
00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:20.818
I had to. She was gonna tell
everyone about our affair.

924
00:59:20.948 --> 00:59:23.951
I couldn't let
her do that.

925
00:59:24.038 --> 00:59:27.041
And Meredith?

926
00:59:27.172 --> 00:59:30.567
She knew about Juliette and I
and she was going to tell you.

927
00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:34.527
I did what I had to do.

928
00:59:38.444 --> 00:59:43.014
I love you so
much. Stacey.

929
00:59:43.101 --> 00:59:44.537
I wish there was
another way.

930
00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:47.540
Jeff. I'll...I'll
keep your secret.

931
00:59:50.935 --> 00:59:53.285
I won't tell
anyone. I won't.

932
00:59:56.723 --> 00:59:59.117
You would do that?

933
00:59:59.247 --> 01:00:00.553
I would do
anything for us.

934
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.733
How could you change
your mind so fast?

935
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.126
I just needed
time to think.

936
01:00:13.392 --> 01:00:15.220
I love you.

937
01:00:15.307 --> 01:00:16.743
I love you. too.

938
01:00:16.874 --> 01:00:18.702
We can be together.

939
01:00:18.832 --> 01:00:24.011
OK.

940
01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:28.320
Stacey!

941
01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:32.672
Why are you making this
harder than it has to be?

942
01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:38.939
GET OFF ME!

943
01:00:39.026 --> 01:00:41.159
I love you. Stacey. but
it's time to say goodbye.

944
01:00:45.076 --> 01:00:47.948
Jeff! What are you doing?

945
01:00:48.079 --> 01:00:49.646
You were having a nightmare.
I was trying to wake you up.

946
01:00:51.343 --> 01:00:53.998
Hey. Stacey. Hey. Hey.

947
01:00:55.434 --> 01:00:57.958
I'm sorry I scared you. I
just came back to get my

948
01:00:58.045 --> 01:00:59.525
briefcase; I texted
you before coming.

949
01:00:59.612 --> 01:01:01.614
Would you just slow down so
we can talk for a minute?

950
01:01:05.879 --> 01:01:07.881
Police. Open up!

951
01:01:07.968 --> 01:01:10.579
Stacey. I swear I'm
innocent. OK. just...

952
01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:11.972
Can you call Mike please and
tell him what's happening?

953
01:01:13.278 --> 01:01:14.105
I love you.

954
01:01:46.093 --> 01:01:47.094
Joelle?

955
01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:48.269
-What's happening?

956
01:01:48.356 --> 01:01:49.401
They arrested Jeff.

957
01:01:51.403 --> 01:01:53.884
They arrested him for
Juliette's murder.

958
01:01:53.971 --> 01:01:55.146
-What?

959
01:01:58.627 --> 01:02:00.673
Thanks. Mom.

960
01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.327
I never thought
it would have been so easy

961
01:02:02.414 --> 01:02:03.981
to tell you all of this.

962
01:02:05.634 --> 01:02:06.810
Am I allowed to
talk now?

963
01:02:09.247 --> 01:02:11.249
Of course I want to hear
what you have to say.

964
01:02:13.381 --> 01:02:15.949
I appreciate you
telling me all of this.

965
01:02:17.472 --> 01:02:19.997
As your mother. I should be
protecting you from harm.

966
01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:23.130
not adding to it. I am so sorry

967
01:02:23.217 --> 01:02:24.915
for how I handled our
conversation last time.

968
01:02:27.874 --> 01:02:29.484
Thank you.

969
01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:33.488
OK. Now we need to
take care of you.

970
01:02:33.619 --> 01:02:36.143
I know I haven't been
Jeff's biggest cheerleader

971
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:38.972
in the past but. Stacey.
there is a big difference

972
01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:41.279
between being a liar or a
cheater and being a murder--

973
01:02:48.155 --> 01:02:50.027
Do you really believe
Jeff killed that girl?

974
01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:58.513
The murder weapon
was at our house.

975
01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.125
Jeff has no alibi; his cell
phone was at a crime scene--

976
01:03:01.212 --> 01:03:04.128
You're not answering
my question.

977
01:03:04.215 --> 01:03:07.784
Can you tell me out loud that
your husband is a killer?

978
01:03:16.488 --> 01:03:17.881
That's what I thought.

979
01:03:21.362 --> 01:03:22.537
Hello?

980
01:03:22.624 --> 01:03:26.063
Hey. Stacey. Jeff's already
had his arraignment.

981
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:28.108
As I thought. there's
no possibility of bail

982
01:03:28.239 --> 01:03:30.284
without a bond hearing which
is set for later today.

983
01:03:30.415 --> 01:03:32.199
OK.

984
01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:33.722
I also got disclosure
of evidence.

985
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.594
which I'll take a look at
and then we should meet.

986
01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:38.075
Are you available later today?

987
01:03:38.162 --> 01:03:41.426
I don't know. Is it
gonna make a difference?

988
01:03:41.513 --> 01:03:43.515
Stacey. you're
still his wife.

989
01:03:43.645 --> 01:03:45.212
Nobody knows him
like you do.

990
01:03:45.299 --> 01:03:46.344
Having you testify
in his favor

991
01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:48.433
at the bond hearing
also couldn't hurt.

992
01:03:48.563 --> 01:03:51.305
I'll see you later and uh.

993
01:03:51.392 --> 01:03:52.829
I'll let you know
about the hearing.

994
01:03:57.442 --> 01:03:59.183
This file contains everything
they have on Jeff so far.

995
01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:07.713
Why a glove?

996
01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.323
-It was found on the
lawn of the cottage

997
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:10.977
where Juliette
was killed.

998
01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:12.805
It's covered in
gun residue.

999
01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.241
The police think the
killer dropped it

1000
01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:16.287
when they were
fleeing the scene.

1001
01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:19.290
Gun residue. That means the
killer was wearing this

1002
01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:20.378
when he shot Juliette?

1003
01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:24.469
Can we find out what fabric
this glove is made of?

1004
01:04:24.599 --> 01:04:27.037
Yeah. no problem. I can
call the detective. But why?

1005
01:04:27.124 --> 01:04:28.212
Jeff has severe allergies.

1006
01:04:30.127 --> 01:04:32.694
Right. To what materials again?

1007
01:04:32.781 --> 01:04:35.132
Polyester and latex
are the worst ones.

1008
01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:37.351
He breaks out
in a bad rash.

1009
01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:39.136
It usually lasts a
week or so.

1010
01:04:42.226 --> 01:04:45.969
He could have never
hid this from me.

1011
01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:54.412
Hey. how
did it go?

1012
01:04:54.499 --> 01:04:56.675
Fine. A little
overwhelming

1013
01:04:56.762 --> 01:04:58.590
looking at all
the evidence.

1014
01:04:58.677 --> 01:05:00.200
Where's Mom?

1015
01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:02.899
She's upstairs. Probably
still picking out an outfit.

1016
01:05:05.423 --> 01:05:08.121
Mike told me that Jeff
thinks Ellen could have

1017
01:05:08.252 --> 01:05:10.384
something to do with
Juliette's murder.

1018
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:12.473
What? Ellen?

1019
01:05:12.604 --> 01:05:14.562
Apparently. she
did something wrong

1020
01:05:14.649 --> 01:05:16.738
when she was managing
Juliette's business plan

1021
01:05:16.825 --> 01:05:18.305
and then offered her
a big amount of cash

1022
01:05:18.392 --> 01:05:20.133
not to talk about it.

1023
01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.743
Is there any proof?

1024
01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:23.093
Ellen told Jeff
there were emails

1025
01:05:23.223 --> 01:05:24.268
between her
and Juliette.

1026
01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:26.270
Mike's on it.

1027
01:05:30.448 --> 01:05:32.319
Hey. Mike?

1028
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:33.494
The detective on the
case was very quick

1029
01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:34.931
getting back to me.

1030
01:05:35.018 --> 01:05:37.281
Your hunch was right: the
glove is 100% polyester.

1031
01:05:39.196 --> 01:05:41.154
This could be
great for us.

1032
01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:43.243
But I suggest we wait
before telling the police.

1033
01:05:43.374 --> 01:05:45.550
At least until we get the
results of the DNA analysis.

1034
01:05:45.637 --> 01:05:47.900
Jeff can't wear those
gloves. It's impossible.

1035
01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:49.684
-I hear you. but they're
gonna do everything they can

1036
01:05:49.771 --> 01:05:51.469
to find a loophole...

1037
01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:54.124
like saying Jeff could
have worn glove liners.

1038
01:05:54.254 --> 01:05:55.603
I'll get you the
number for his doctor.

1039
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:57.692
but it's a very
severe allergy.

1040
01:05:57.779 --> 01:06:00.086
I had to buy a new couch
and change half my wardrobe

1041
01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:01.348
when I met him.

1042
01:06:01.479 --> 01:06:03.133
-Oh. I know.

1043
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.569
Send me the number
of his dermatologist

1044
01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:05.831
and if we need to.

1045
01:06:05.918 --> 01:06:07.572
I'll have him in court
as an expert witness.

1046
01:06:07.659 --> 01:06:08.921
I'm confident. Mike.

1047
01:06:10.227 --> 01:06:12.794
This is good news. honey!

1048
01:06:12.881 --> 01:06:14.361
You're allowed to
have hope for Jeff.

1049
01:06:14.492 --> 01:06:15.623
Just the same way
you were allowed

1050
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:17.625
to lose your
trust in him.

1051
01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:19.366
Those feelings are
natural and real.

1052
01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:21.151
You can't fight them.

1053
01:06:21.238 --> 01:06:22.239
Thanks. Mom.

1054
01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:36.427
But if Jeff isn't guilty.
then someone is framing him.

1055
01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:37.819
I wanna know more
about Ellen.

1056
01:06:37.906 --> 01:06:40.039
Maybe Jeff is right and she
had something to do with it.

1057
01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:40.779
Ellen?

1058
01:06:40.909 --> 01:06:42.563
Oh. I'll explain later.

1059
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:44.522
I may not understand
everything that's going on.

1060
01:06:44.609 --> 01:06:46.480
but it's clear you have
more urgent things to do

1061
01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:48.743
than to go to Jeff's hearing.

1062
01:06:48.874 --> 01:06:51.529
If you're OK with
it. I can go.

1063
01:06:51.616 --> 01:06:53.879
I've known Jeff long
enough to testify for him.

1064
01:06:55.228 --> 01:06:56.316
You would do that?

1065
01:06:56.447 --> 01:06:58.536
-Of course I would.

1066
01:06:58.623 --> 01:07:01.147
And just so things
are clear between us.

1067
01:07:01.278 --> 01:07:03.019
I'll never believe Jeff
could kill someone.

1068
01:07:06.848 --> 01:07:09.242
Well. where are
you gonna start?

1069
01:07:09.373 --> 01:07:11.549
I'll go back to
Roberto's Pizza Place.

1070
01:07:11.679 --> 01:07:14.943
And then maybe I'll
stop at Jeff's office.

1071
01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:20.558
I'll keep you updated
as I go. And thank you.

1072
01:07:20.645 --> 01:07:21.907
Let me know how it
goes at the hearing.

1073
01:07:28.305 --> 01:07:29.697
Hello?

1074
01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:35.616
Hey. I just got home.
Jeff has been bailed out.

1075
01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:38.793
Mom paid the bail. but he has
a long list of restrictions.

1076
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:43.624
Mom paid? What kind of
restrictions does he have?

1077
01:07:43.755 --> 01:07:45.583
-Well. he's not allowed
to be around you

1078
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:47.846
or have any
interaction with you.

1079
01:07:47.933 --> 01:07:50.675
He can't go to
work either.

1080
01:07:50.762 --> 01:07:52.546
He has to report to a
corrections officer

1081
01:07:52.633 --> 01:07:55.201
every day. morning
and night.

1082
01:07:55.332 --> 01:07:57.682
He has to wear an ankle monitor.

1083
01:07:57.769 --> 01:08:00.206
And... he's gonna stay at Mom's.

1084
01:08:02.774 --> 01:08:04.602
Is Mom OK with that?

1085
01:08:04.689 --> 01:08:07.300
-She's happy to help.

1086
01:08:07.387 --> 01:08:10.390
She'll never stop
surprising me.

1087
01:08:10.521 --> 01:08:13.785
I'm just waiting for Selena
at Roberto's Pizza Place.

1088
01:08:13.872 --> 01:08:15.656
If she confirms that Ellen
is the woman Juliette

1089
01:08:15.743 --> 01:08:19.573
was arguing with. I'll try
to pay her a visit after.

1090
01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.706
OK. Let me know
how it goes please.

1091
01:08:21.835 --> 01:08:22.794
-I'll call you later.

1092
01:08:24.535 --> 01:08:27.363
Sounds like Stacey's on a
mission to clear Jeff's name.

1093
01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:29.844
And what happened since
yesterday to change her mind?

1094
01:08:29.931 --> 01:08:31.237
She found out
Juliette's killer

1095
01:08:31.368 --> 01:08:33.805
was wearing
polyester gloves.

1096
01:08:33.892 --> 01:08:35.546
We all know Jeff could
never wear those.

1097
01:08:35.675 --> 01:08:36.764
Wow. That's amazing!

1098
01:08:36.851 --> 01:08:39.202
Yeah.

1099
01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:42.639
Stacey is so strong.

1100
01:08:42.727 --> 01:08:44.336
I know she's gonna find
out the truth about

1101
01:08:44.468 --> 01:08:47.645
what happened. Like you
said. she's on a mission.

1102
01:08:50.648 --> 01:08:52.084
Hi. what can I
do for you?

1103
01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:54.478
Hi. I came in not
too long ago

1104
01:08:54.565 --> 01:08:56.523
to ask you some
questions.

1105
01:08:56.610 --> 01:08:57.307
Do you remember me?

1106
01:08:57.394 --> 01:08:58.612
Of course I do.

1107
01:08:58.699 --> 01:09:00.484
You mentioned that
Juliette Lane.

1108
01:09:00.571 --> 01:09:01.658
the girl who
was murdered.

1109
01:09:01.746 --> 01:09:03.487
came in one day with a
woman and they argued.

1110
01:09:03.617 --> 01:09:07.360
Mm hm.

1111
01:09:07.491 --> 01:09:09.928
Is this her?

1112
01:09:10.014 --> 01:09:12.539
Yes. that looks
like her.

1113
01:09:12.626 --> 01:09:13.671
Thank you.

1114
01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.541
Right.

1115
01:09:19.981 --> 01:09:22.375
She confirmed Ellen is
the woman she saw fighting

1116
01:09:22.461 --> 01:09:24.638
with Juliette. We're
definitely on to something.

1117
01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:27.424
Wow. she really could
be framing Jeff.

1118
01:09:27.511 --> 01:09:29.295
-Yes. I'm gonna go
to the office to see

1119
01:09:29.425 --> 01:09:30.905
what I can find.

1120
01:09:31.036 --> 01:09:33.211
-It's not safe. Let me
at least go with you.

1121
01:09:33.343 --> 01:09:34.604
-I'm not sure I
can go tonight.

1122
01:09:34.692 --> 01:09:35.736
If I can't reach Peter.

1123
01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:37.434
I have to go check on
the Marshall house.

1124
01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:38.782
It hits the market tomorrow.

1125
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:40.827
OK. Well. call me
on your way back.

1126
01:09:40.915 --> 01:09:42.482
I'll be waiting
at your place.

1127
01:09:42.568 --> 01:09:43.613
OK.

1128
01:09:48.923 --> 01:09:50.447
Poor Stacey.

1129
01:09:50.533 --> 01:09:53.450
I know.

1130
01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:55.365
So. you're gonna stay with
her for a while. then?

1131
01:09:55.452 --> 01:09:56.975
Yeah.

1132
01:09:57.062 --> 01:09:59.456
I don't want to leave her alone.

1133
01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:01.632
What are you gonna
do without me?

1134
01:10:01.719 --> 01:10:04.722
I'll probably check
in on Sean.

1135
01:10:04.809 --> 01:10:06.419
He's having a bit of
a tough time lately.

1136
01:10:06.505 --> 01:10:09.379
Oh. well. He's lucky to
have such a great uncle.

1137
01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.643
I guess.

1138
01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:13.861
I'll see you tomorrow?

1139
01:10:13.948 --> 01:10:14.862
OK.

1140
01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:37.423
Hello?

1141
01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:45.648
Stacey?

1142
01:11:46.476 --> 01:11:48.478
Peter? I'm in here.

1143
01:11:53.744 --> 01:11:54.962
Oh. my god. Stacey!

1144
01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:56.834
Someone was in the house. We
need to call the police.

1145
01:12:01.752 --> 01:12:03.754
It's too bad you
didn't see anyone.

1146
01:12:03.841 --> 01:12:06.539
I'm sorry. Are you gonna
be all right to drive?

1147
01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:09.585
Yes. Thank you. Peter.

1148
01:12:09.716 --> 01:12:10.674
OK. Come on.

1149
01:12:26.994 --> 01:12:28.213
They were
right there.

1150
01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.129
We could've had them.

1151
01:12:31.216 --> 01:12:32.565
I'm just so happy
you're all right.

1152
01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:34.741
Thanks for coming.

1153
01:12:34.871 --> 01:12:35.960
Of course.

1154
01:12:36.047 --> 01:12:38.702
It's so scary.

1155
01:12:38.832 --> 01:12:40.965
I'm staying over
tonight. OK?

1156
01:12:41.052 --> 01:12:42.749
Why don't I make
us some tea?

1157
01:12:42.835 --> 01:12:43.880
Thanks. Jo.

1158
01:12:58.852 --> 01:13:00.593
I didn't hear
you get in.

1159
01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.117
How did it go at
the police station?

1160
01:13:03.204 --> 01:13:05.468
They're not sure the incident
from last night is related

1161
01:13:05.555 --> 01:13:07.600
to Juliette or
Meredith's murder.

1162
01:13:07.687 --> 01:13:09.820
Come on. Really?

1163
01:13:09.907 --> 01:13:11.038
Detective Munger told
said it could just be

1164
01:13:11.169 --> 01:13:14.085
a home invasion
gone wrong.

1165
01:13:14.172 --> 01:13:15.565
If only I could have given
them a good description.

1166
01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.178
I still want to go to the
office and look into Ellen.

1167
01:13:20.264 --> 01:13:21.919
regarding her
confession to Jeff

1168
01:13:22.049 --> 01:13:23.877
about her background
with Juliette.

1169
01:13:23.964 --> 01:13:25.487
Then the argument
at the pizza place.

1170
01:13:25.575 --> 01:13:27.272
but first I need
to talk to Jeff.

1171
01:13:47.639 --> 01:13:48.859
Hey. sweetie.

1172
01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:53.994
Hey. Mom. Is ...is Jeff
close to you right now?

1173
01:13:54.125 --> 01:13:55.952
Yes. why?

1174
01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:57.781
-Can you put your phone
on speaker. please?

1175
01:14:03.351 --> 01:14:06.920
Jeff. I know you're not
supposed to call or talk

1176
01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:09.662
to Stacey right now. but...

1177
01:14:09.749 --> 01:14:11.447
this is just me
calling my mom...

1178
01:14:13.753 --> 01:14:15.451
and Stacey is
sitting next to me.

1179
01:14:18.932 --> 01:14:28.246
Uh... hey. Um. I hope you
and Stacey are doing OK.

1180
01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:34.165
Uh. Madeline told me what
happened at the Marshall house.

1181
01:14:34.252 --> 01:14:38.778
I uh. wish I could have
been there for Stacey.

1182
01:14:38.865 --> 01:14:42.041
-Don't worry I'm taking
good care of her.

1183
01:14:42.173 --> 01:14:45.611
I'm sure Mike told
you about the gloves.

1184
01:14:45.698 --> 01:14:50.398
Yeah. he did. My wife's
a friggin' genius.

1185
01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:53.837
-Well. she wanted me to
tell you that she knows you

1186
01:14:53.967 --> 01:14:58.494
didn't do anything. and she's
sorry for how she acted.

1187
01:15:03.063 --> 01:15:06.240
It um.
It means the world

1188
01:15:06.327 --> 01:15:08.504
to know that she's
behind me. Thank you.

1189
01:15:12.116 --> 01:15:15.815
It's...it's so hard
to be away from her

1190
01:15:15.946 --> 01:15:17.773
with all of this
going on. I...

1191
01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:21.168
Jeff. I miss you so much.

1192
01:15:21.255 --> 01:15:24.215
I promise I'm gonna find a
way to get you out of this.

1193
01:15:24.344 --> 01:15:26.652
But please. just
... just be careful.

1194
01:16:22.621 --> 01:16:23.230
Stacey.

1195
01:16:26.364 --> 01:16:27.452
What are you
doing here?

1196
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.585
I know you're
hiding something

1197
01:16:30.716 --> 01:16:31.587
about your history
with Juliette.

1198
01:16:37.288 --> 01:16:39.769
I suppose we should get
this over with then.

1199
01:16:39.856 --> 01:16:40.770
Excuse me?

1200
01:16:42.249 --> 01:16:43.728
I knew somebody would
find out eventually.

1201
01:16:46.427 --> 01:16:48.821
I'm happy you agreed
to go out tonight.

1202
01:16:48.907 --> 01:16:51.084
We haven't had much
time together lately.

1203
01:16:51.171 --> 01:16:53.652
-I'm sorry. I've
just been so worried

1204
01:16:53.739 --> 01:16:55.959
about Stacey
and my mom.

1205
01:16:56.046 --> 01:16:58.744
But... I'm glad we're finally
getting some time together.

1206
01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:04.924
You're not gonna
take that?

1207
01:17:05.055 --> 01:17:07.013
No. it's just Sean.

1208
01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:08.014
I just need a break;

1209
01:17:08.101 --> 01:17:09.625
I don't know what
to tell him anymore.

1210
01:17:11.278 --> 01:17:12.062
Mm. I'll wait for
you downstairs?

1211
01:17:12.148 --> 01:17:13.150
Yeah.

1212
01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:19.635
Jeff told me
about the money.

1213
01:17:21.288 --> 01:17:22.333
I know there's
something else.

1214
01:17:22.463 --> 01:17:24.291
You wouldn't be this scared
if it was only a bribe

1215
01:17:24.378 --> 01:17:26.554
to cover a small mistake.

1216
01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.208
Are you really gonna let
Jeff go to jail for something

1217
01:17:28.295 --> 01:17:30.166
you know he didn't do?

1218
01:17:30.254 --> 01:17:32.822
You're right. Stacey.
There is something more

1219
01:17:35.302 --> 01:17:38.610
Recently. Juliette
sent me an email

1220
01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:40.090
saying that she now wanted money

1221
01:17:40.177 --> 01:17:42.832
I offered her months ago.

1222
01:17:42.919 --> 01:17:44.616
I talked to her over the
phone and I convinced her

1223
01:17:44.746 --> 01:17:46.923
to meet me in person.

1224
01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:49.708
We...we were supposed
to meet last Monday.

1225
01:17:49.839 --> 01:17:52.755
But as you can imagine.
it never happened

1226
01:17:52.842 --> 01:17:55.975
because she was killed
the night before.

1227
01:17:56.106 --> 01:17:58.282
I was scared that the police
would find out about it

1228
01:17:58.369 --> 01:18:01.111
and mark me as a suspect.

1229
01:18:01.198 --> 01:18:05.505
I even offered Jeff a fake alibi
that would help the both of us.

1230
01:18:05.593 --> 01:18:07.117
But Jeff didn't
take you up on it.

1231
01:18:07.246 --> 01:18:10.947
No. No he didn't.

1232
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.175
Alek. Hurry up. please.

1233
01:18:22.306 --> 01:18:23.568
-Give me five minutes.

1234
01:18:24.525 --> 01:18:26.397
OK. I'm gonna go
warm up the car.

1235
01:18:39.802 --> 01:18:41.020
Hey. how did it go?

1236
01:18:41.107 --> 01:18:43.022
Hey. I just got a
weird text from Sean

1237
01:18:43.109 --> 01:18:44.154
and now he won't
answer his phone.

1238
01:18:44.284 --> 01:18:46.156
Has he tried to get in
touch with you guys?

1239
01:18:46.243 --> 01:18:48.071
-Uh. yeah. Actually. he

1240
01:18:48.157 --> 01:18:50.550
tried calling Alek
maybe ten minutes ago.

1241
01:18:50.638 --> 01:18:52.728
-I've got a bad
feeling about this.

1242
01:18:52.815 --> 01:18:54.686
Stay put; I'm on my way over.

1243
01:18:54.773 --> 01:18:55.905
Sean. I'm serious.

1244
01:18:55.992 --> 01:18:58.037
You need to stop calling
me when I'm with Joelle.

1245
01:18:58.124 --> 01:18:59.430
Keep it together.

1246
01:18:59.517 --> 01:19:00.952
-Alek. listen. I've been
doing a lot of thinking--

1247
01:19:01.084 --> 01:19:02.259
Sean!

1248
01:19:02.346 --> 01:19:04.217
I'm gonna try
calling Sean again.

1249
01:19:04.304 --> 01:19:05.392
-Yeah. let me
know what he says.

1250
01:19:07.481 --> 01:19:09.440
Switching to Bluetooth.

1251
01:19:09.527 --> 01:19:12.182
I agreed to hide the gun
and cell at Jeff's house

1252
01:19:12.269 --> 01:19:14.184
cause you said it
was your only option.

1253
01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:16.273
I had no idea it
was Jeff's phone

1254
01:19:16.403 --> 01:19:17.883
or that you shot
your mistress!

1255
01:19:26.674 --> 01:19:27.850
Sean? Sean are you there?

1256
01:19:35.553 --> 01:19:36.772
Joelle? You need to go now.

1257
01:19:40.036 --> 01:19:42.081
Alek? Are you there? I'm
gonna be there in a minute.

1258
01:19:50.437 --> 01:19:51.699
I don't know what
you heard exactly

1259
01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:53.309
but Sean is losing it.

1260
01:19:53.397 --> 01:19:54.833
He's done a lot
of terrible things

1261
01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:56.139
and he's trying to
pin it all on me.

1262
01:19:58.054 --> 01:20:02.145
Yeah. He did seem
really upset.

1263
01:20:02.275 --> 01:20:04.277
But why didn't you
tell me earlier?

1264
01:20:04.364 --> 01:20:07.324
Just stay calm;
walk to the house.

1265
01:20:07.411 --> 01:20:08.804
I can explain everything.

1266
01:20:10.196 --> 01:20:11.327
I said get in the house now.

1267
01:20:19.423 --> 01:20:21.077
Alek. Let's talk--

1268
01:20:21.164 --> 01:20:22.165
-Shut up. I'm tryin' to think.

1269
01:20:24.297 --> 01:20:26.125
Alek. let go of me.

1270
01:20:26.212 --> 01:20:27.126
THAT'S ENOUGH!

1271
01:20:36.092 --> 01:20:38.137
Sean. Sean. Sean. Sean!

1272
01:20:38.224 --> 01:20:38.964
What are you doing here?

1273
01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:40.183
No. What are you doing. Alek?

1274
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:41.837
Stay outta this.
Sean. I'm warning you.

1275
01:20:41.924 --> 01:20:43.403
Alek.
you're hurting me.

1276
01:20:43.534 --> 01:20:45.188
You are forcing me.
Joelle. Just get inside!

1277
01:20:48.191 --> 01:20:51.324
Alek! Stop. Stop it!

1278
01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:54.501
Hey. whoa whoa whoa!

1279
01:20:54.588 --> 01:20:57.416
I called the police.
They know everything.

1280
01:20:57.504 --> 01:21:00.290
We know you killed Juliette
and Meredith. It's over.

1281
01:21:00.377 --> 01:21:01.594
Shut up. Stacey!

1282
01:21:01.682 --> 01:21:02.858
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1283
01:21:06.383 --> 01:21:09.386
She's so damn right.

1284
01:21:09.516 --> 01:21:11.388
And you played me
right from the start.

1285
01:21:15.130 --> 01:21:17.263
I need you to hide this
in Jeff's home office.

1286
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:19.178
All right? I'm gonna be
in a meeting with him;

1287
01:21:19.264 --> 01:21:20.745
Stacey's gonna be with
Joelle at the park.

1288
01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.398
There's nobody home.

1289
01:21:22.529 --> 01:21:24.139
Now is the perfect
time for you to go.

1290
01:21:26.403 --> 01:21:27.883
-Alek. What happened?

1291
01:21:27.969 --> 01:21:28.492
-You don't get to know.

1292
01:21:30.624 --> 01:21:32.017
Remember when I
saved your ass

1293
01:21:32.103 --> 01:21:33.192
on that drunk
driving charge?

1294
01:21:33.279 --> 01:21:34.454
And you hit
somebody?

1295
01:21:34.541 --> 01:21:36.630
Well. now you get to return
the favor and help me.

1296
01:21:36.761 --> 01:21:37.893
I mean. nobody's
gonna think to look

1297
01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:38.763
in Jeff's
house. right?

1298
01:21:40.547 --> 01:21:43.507
Hey. Sean. You owe me this.

1299
01:21:45.378 --> 01:21:48.599
And I'm done keeping
my mouth shut.

1300
01:21:48.686 --> 01:21:50.644
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

1301
01:21:50.731 --> 01:21:52.472
I know you killed Juliette
and you told Joelle

1302
01:21:52.603 --> 01:21:53.778
you were with me the
night Meredith died.

1303
01:21:53.865 --> 01:21:54.474
He wasn't!

1304
01:21:54.561 --> 01:21:55.258
-Keep your voice down.

1305
01:21:55.388 --> 01:21:56.346
-I won't!

1306
01:21:57.825 --> 01:22:00.306
You even planned to kill
Stacey in the house for sale.

1307
01:22:00.437 --> 01:22:01.438
You're a monster.

1308
01:22:01.568 --> 01:22:03.309
-You're the one who
planted the gun

1309
01:22:03.396 --> 01:22:05.833
and the cell at
Jeff's. All right?

1310
01:22:05.964 --> 01:22:07.270
It's your word
against mine.

1311
01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.145
Let him go.

1312
01:22:14.973 --> 01:22:15.843
Stop it.

1313
01:22:16.409 --> 01:22:17.889
Stop it.

1314
01:22:17.976 --> 01:22:18.934
Alek. Stop it!

1315
01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:22.415
the
whole stupid thing.

1316
01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:39.955
Nothing would've happened

1317
01:22:40.041 --> 01:22:42.174
if Juliette hadn't
threatened me.

1318
01:22:42.261 --> 01:22:44.611
She said she was gonna tell
everybody about our affair.

1319
01:22:44.698 --> 01:22:47.223
Joelle. I love you so
much. You gotta believe me.

1320
01:22:47.309 --> 01:22:49.050
I never loved Juliette.

1321
01:22:49.138 --> 01:22:51.618
I hacked into
your email. Alek.

1322
01:22:51.749 --> 01:22:54.143
I have proof of your affair
with Juliette. You're done.

1323
01:22:55.621 --> 01:22:57.973
But why did
you frame Jeff?

1324
01:22:58.103 --> 01:23:00.496
Alek was unhappy
with his demotion

1325
01:23:00.584 --> 01:23:03.108
when he got
transferred at ARXB.

1326
01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:05.502
He wanted Jeff's
position.

1327
01:23:05.589 --> 01:23:07.286
Please. Joelle.
Don't listen to him.

1328
01:23:07.373 --> 01:23:08.853
It was never supposed
to happen this way.

1329
01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.594
I never wanted you
or your sister.

1330
01:23:11.725 --> 01:23:13.249
or Jeff to be involved.

1331
01:23:13.335 --> 01:23:15.773
It was a mistake. I swear.

1332
01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:18.776
I grabbed Jeff's phone
by accident and then--

1333
01:23:18.906 --> 01:23:23.128
And then. you pocket-dialed
me with my husband's phone

1334
01:23:23.259 --> 01:23:25.782
while you killed your mistress.

1335
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:29.787
Framing Jeff for Juliette's
murder was the perfect plan

1336
01:23:29.874 --> 01:23:32.529
to get him out of the way
so you could take his job.

1337
01:23:32.659 --> 01:23:34.966
I can't even look at you.

1338
01:23:35.097 --> 01:23:36.446
-Stay away from my sister!

1339
01:23:39.144 --> 01:23:41.494
Alek. you're not going anywhere.

1340
01:23:41.625 --> 01:23:44.062
I don't want to shoot you.

1341
01:23:44.148 --> 01:23:45.455
But I will if you make me.

1342
01:24:08.478 --> 01:24:10.001
OK. Here we go.

1343
01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.612
What's this?

1344
01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:16.312
Oh. it's another
letter from Alek.

1345
01:24:16.398 --> 01:24:18.618
You should read it when
you get the chance.

1346
01:24:18.749 --> 01:24:20.403
I still can't believe
how delusional he is

1347
01:24:20.532 --> 01:24:23.101
thinking I'll go
visit him in jail.

1348
01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:25.712
Ah. Here you are.

1349
01:24:25.799 --> 01:24:27.758
Sorry we're late.
Your mother couldn't decide

1350
01:24:27.888 --> 01:24:30.413
what outfit to
wear. as per usual.

1351
01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.282
You look great.

1352
01:24:31.414 --> 01:24:32.589
Thanks. honey.

1353
01:24:32.719 --> 01:24:36.636
And um. the other letter?
Is a confirmation that

1354
01:24:36.767 --> 01:24:40.510
I've been accepted to
Doctors without Borders.

1355
01:24:40.639 --> 01:24:42.077
I leave next week.

1356
01:24:42.207 --> 01:24:44.296
I'm beyond happy for you. Sis.

1357
01:24:44.427 --> 01:24:45.471
Thank you.

1358
01:24:45.558 --> 01:24:47.386
I am so proud of my girls.

1359
01:24:47.473 --> 01:24:50.476
To Joelle. my brilliant
little sister.

1360
01:24:50.563 --> 01:24:51.173
Cheers.

1361
01:25:01.183 --> 01:25:03.141
Stacey?
-Mm.

1362
01:25:03.272 --> 01:25:08.407
To you. Who knows
where I'd be without you?

1363
01:25:08.494 --> 01:25:10.496
Happy Anniversary. Jeff.

1364
01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:12.368
Happy Anniversary.

1365
01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:22.160
Let's celebrate!

1366
01:25:22.246 --> 01:25:23.118
Come here!
