who pays more money to the men's

101
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.958
even though the women's team
are the world champions

and the men are not.

103
00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:36.833
So. merely for showing up
and playing a game.

104
00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:41.458
the men get more per game
than the women.

105
00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:46.583
For each game they win.
the men get a higher bonus

106
00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:49.583
than the women would get
for winning that game.

107
00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:53.166

That's just a starting place
in money.

117

that's taken place.

119
00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:27.583

like. to Motel 6.

121

125
00:06:40.291 --> 00:06:41.333

was after they won
the World Cup.

127
00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:49.791

is because they are not men.

00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:01.291
and I think that
they do deserve credit for that

517
00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:04.458
when we talk about all the
other federations in the world.

518
00:26:04.541 --> 00:26:06.541
but just because you're better
than someone who's bad

519
00:26:06.625 --> 00:26:09.083
doesn't mean necessarily
that you're good.

520
00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:11.625
MADDOW: It's great to have you
here. congratulations.

521
00:26:11.708 --> 00:26:12.833
RAPINOE: I think the way
I am off the field

522
00:26:12.916 --> 00:26:15.125

like. narrative
with athletes of. like.

547
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:09.208
all athletes are always talking

548
00:27:09.291 --> 00:27:10.625
about how hard
they work all the time.

549
00:27:10.708 --> 00:27:12.291
So does everybody else.

550
00:27:14.416 --> 00:27:18.208
I think we were definitely
raised that way.

551
00:27:18.291 --> 00:27:20.208
Just pretty standard
blue-collar.

552
00:27:20.291 --> 00:27:22.875
um. working.
working-class family.

553
00:27:22.958 --> 00:27:26.083
My dad's
a construction supervisor.

554
00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:27.791
and my mom's a waitress.

555
00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:30.375
She grew up super poor.

556
00:27:30.458 --> 00:27:33.541
I think that I'm
a perfect snapshot of America.

557
00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:37.708
You know. I'm not from.
like. crazy. like left-wing.

558
00:27:37.791 --> 00:27:41.666
you know. coastal elite family
or anything.

559
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.541
I'm just really just normal.
you know.

560
00:27:44.625 --> 00:27:48.458
regular. small-town
sort of family.

561
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.125
You could look at me
and say like.

562
00:27:51.208 --> 00:27:52.416
oh. I'm the American dream.

563
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.833
And then like. you know.
look at my brother and be like.

564
00:27:54.916 --> 00:27:58.791
oh. this is the American reality
in a lot of ways.

565
00:27:58.875 --> 00:28:00.708
I think we were like 10
or something

566
00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:02.791
when he like. got arrested
for the first time.

567
00:28:02.875 --> 00:28:06.708
Really probably just needed
like drug treatment. you know?

568
00:28:06.791 --> 00:28:09.250
We had this crazy
opioid epidemic

569
00:28:09.333 --> 00:28:11.666
that was just left
totally unfettered

570
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.708
and actually encouraged.

571
00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:16.916
and. you know.
sort of. here we are.

572
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.916
I think it's actually
like the perfect example

573
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.083
of having like this. you know.

574
00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:24.083
exceptional. like.
world-beating athlete be.

575
00:28:24.166 --> 00:28:25.708
you know. the.
you know. in essence.

576
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:26.958
the very same person as this.

577
00:28:27.041 --> 00:28:30.250
like. person who got swept up
in all this shit.

578
00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:36.125
so it's like a true
American story. basically.

579
00:28:36.208 --> 00:28:38.791
[cheering]

580
00:28:38.875 --> 00:28:40.958
I mean. I think
it's all connected.

581
00:28:41.041 --> 00:28:43.250
GIRLS: Megan! Megan! Megan!

582
00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:45.541
RAPINOE: Me Too or
Black Lives Matter or anything.

583
00:28:45.625 --> 00:28:49.125
it's sort of--
to me. it's all the same fight.

584
00:28:49.208 --> 00:28:50.083
GIRL: Hi. Megan!

585
00:28:50.166 --> 00:28:51.416
RAPINOE: Hi! How are you?

586
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.625
GIRL: I watch you on TV.

587
00:28:52.708 --> 00:28:53.875
RAPINOE: You do?

588
00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:55.958
Like probably every woman
we're getting go. go. go from.

589
00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:58.500
you know. every woman. I think.
is watching this.

590
00:28:58.583 --> 00:28:59.750
WOMAN: One. two. three!

591
00:28:59.833 --> 00:29:01.291
WOMAN: This book.
my students wrote it.

592
00:29:01.375 --> 00:29:02.291
RAPINOE: Amazing!

593
00:29:02.375 --> 00:29:05.416
To see. like. it go
through all generations

594
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.625
is kind of incredible.

595
00:29:06.708 --> 00:29:09.125
You can. you know. and to see
the different emotion

596
00:29:09.208 --> 00:29:14.000
in all the different ages
of eyes is really cool.

597
00:29:14.083 --> 00:29:15.000
You know.
older woman being like.

598
00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:16.166
"I know I'm never
going to see it.

599
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:17.500
but. like. I hope you guys
get it. you know?"

600
00:29:17.583 --> 00:29:18.750
And then little kids
saying it to me.

601
00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:20.875
WOMAN: So. Megan. we really
want equal pay for her.

602
00:29:20.958 --> 00:29:22.000
RAPINOE: I know. right.

603
00:29:22.083 --> 00:29:24.333
I probably won't get it.
but you might!

604
00:29:24.416 --> 00:29:25.291
WOMAN: Thank you!

605
00:29:25.375 --> 00:29:26.416
RAPINOE: Yeah. maybe I'll get it

606
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.916
like one or two years
in my career hopefully.

607
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.916
but. you know. really
it's going to be. like.

608
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.583
for all these little kids
that are coming up now.

609
00:29:37.166 --> 00:29:38.833
McDONALD: That's exactly
what we're fighting for.

610
00:29:38.916 --> 00:29:40.541
We're fighting for that change.

611
00:29:40.625 --> 00:29:43.583
and literally. like. people
have stopped me in my tracks

612
00:29:43.666 --> 00:29:47.041
just to say thank you. and
that's because of this fight.

613
00:29:49.458 --> 00:29:52.083
I mean. it's 2020.
and at this point.

614
00:29:52.166 --> 00:29:55.833
we need equity.
and we need equality.

615
00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:58.791
The beginning of my career
with the NWSL.

616
00:29:58.875 --> 00:30:03.750
I got traded six times
in like four or five years.

617
00:30:03.833 --> 00:30:07.791
I was only making
about 15 grand each year.

618
00:30:07.875 --> 00:30:10.458
Ahh. let's do this.

619
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:12.541
Off-season.
I had a full-time job.

620
00:30:12.625 --> 00:30:18.208
I was packing boxes at Amazon
for 12 bucks an hour.

621
00:30:18.291 --> 00:30:21.125
Aim for the corners. corners.
good finish!

622
00:30:21.208 --> 00:30:24.541
Childcare was more
than my paychecks.

623
00:30:24.625 --> 00:30:27.833
and so there were
a lot of training sessions

624
00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:33.625
where my infant toddler
would be sitting at training

625
00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:35.291
on his own in his stroller.

626
00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:36.541
Did those days suck?

627
00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:38.791
Yeah. there were times my kid
would crap his pants

628
00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:40.583
and I would have to stop
in the middle of training

629
00:30:40.666 --> 00:30:42.416
and go change him.

630
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.041
SAUERBRUNN: A large majority
of my teammates in NWSL

631
00:30:46.125 --> 00:30:47.458
do not make a livable wage.

632
00:30:47.541 --> 00:30:49.875
So many women have had
to make the decision.

633
00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:51.166
like do I live my dream.

634
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.500
or do I. like. have to start
that other part of my life.

635
00:30:54.583 --> 00:30:56.791
that other career
where I can start making money.

636
00:30:56.875 --> 00:30:58.416
I can start
putting money away?

637
00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.875
And Jess made
that tough decision

638
00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:01.250
that she wanted
to live her dream.

639
00:31:01.333 --> 00:31:02.375
and she got to do it.

640
00:31:02.458 --> 00:31:03.416
McDONALD: Much better.

641
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.750
You gotta prep yourself
for success. man!

642
00:31:05.833 --> 00:31:06.916
There you go.

643
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.250
Now. even though I'm
on the USA team. I still work.

644
00:31:09.333 --> 00:31:11.333
I have to coach
just to make ends meet.

645
00:31:11.416 --> 00:31:13.333
Huh!

646
00:31:13.416 --> 00:31:15.416
Wow. I'm right here!

647
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.750
[laughter]

648
00:31:16.833 --> 00:31:20.125
I need to just work my tail off
in order to make it.

649
00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:21.166
Going to training.

650
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.833
doing things that we
need to do to recover.

651
00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:24.416
and then leaving work.

652
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.458
and going home to my other job.
and that's being a mom.

653
00:31:27.541 --> 00:31:29.875
JEREMIAH: Green and yellow.

654
00:31:29.958 --> 00:31:33.250
McDONALD: [laughs]
Like. uh. they're not moving.

655
00:31:33.333 --> 00:31:35.958
How do I tell my coach
how I got injured?

656
00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:38.291
Oh. my goodness.

657
00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:41.541
Kid. you're breaking my back.
you're so heavy.

658
00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:44.000
I couldn't imagine my life
not being a mom.

659
00:31:44.083 --> 00:31:45.166
obviously in this career.

660
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:49.166
because I come home
to my child.

661
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.041
and he's just such a happy kid.

662
00:31:52.125 --> 00:31:54.583
[laughter]

663
00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:55.666
I have Jeremiah's name.

664
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.625
and it's a Bible verse.
Jeremiah 1:5.

665
00:31:58.708 --> 00:32:00.208
"Before I formed you
in the womb.

666
00:32:00.291 --> 00:32:01.458
I knew you before you were born.

667
00:32:01.541 --> 00:32:02.375
I set you apart.

668
00:32:02.458 --> 00:32:06.083
I set you as a prophet
to the nations."

669
00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:08.833
My little guy.

670
00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:10.916
We want to get paid fairly.

671
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
and we want more moms out there

672
00:32:13.083 --> 00:32:16.333
because it's a badass thing
for--can I say that?

673
00:32:16.416 --> 00:32:17.666
Okay. cool. Okay.

674
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:21.041
Well. it's a badass thing when
you can juggle being a parent

675
00:32:21.125 --> 00:32:25.958
and getting paid well
for what you're doing.

676
00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:28.708
I have a family here
in North Carolina

677
00:32:28.791 --> 00:32:30.500
who have been my rock.

678
00:32:30.583 --> 00:32:32.875
and I have no idea
what I would do without them

679
00:32:32.958 --> 00:32:35.333
because I don't have
blood relatives here.

680
00:32:35.416 --> 00:32:39.500
They are my help.
They are my family here.

681
00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:41.791
I was just looking
for somewhere cheaper to live.

682
00:32:41.875 --> 00:32:44.458
and then they just
offered their home.

683
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:47.416
It's like. well. technically
you don't have a home.

684
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.875
so you can just move in with us.

685
00:32:50.958 --> 00:32:53.208
This is just like that break

686
00:32:53.291 --> 00:32:55.666

KESSLER: So. USSF makes
a number of counter-arguments

748
00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:02.375
against our case.

749
00:36:02.458 --> 00:36:08.291
I don't think even one of them
has the slightest bit of merit.

750
00:36:08.375 --> 00:36:09.666
So. one of the arguments

751
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.333
is that if you look
over the last five years.

752
00:36:12.416 --> 00:36:16.083
there are some women on the team
who actually got

753
00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:19.583
more compensation
than some of the men did.

754
00:36:19.666 --> 00:36:22.250
How could that
be discrimination?

755
00:36:22.333 --> 00:36:23.875
Well. it's very simple.

756
00:36:23.958 --> 00:36:26.875
The women played more games
than the men.

757
00:36:26.958 --> 00:36:29.583
they were more successful
than the men.

758
00:36:29.666 --> 00:36:30.916
and they made the World Cup.

759
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.500
and the men didn't
make the World Cup.

760
00:36:33.583 --> 00:36:38.416
So. even with discriminatory
agreements. yes. it's true.

761
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.416
Some of the women made a total
compensation in dollars

762
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.125
more than some of the men.

763
00:36:44.208 --> 00:36:45.416
Does that make it equal?

764
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.958
No. because equality
is about the opportunity.

765
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.625
The USSF does argue also

766
00:36:52.708 --> 00:36:56.458
that the men generate
more revenues for U.S. Soccer.

767
00:36:56.541 --> 00:37:00.708

Well. that should be a basis.

00:37:04.875 --> 00:37:08.166
Since 2015. we have their

770
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.041

they assigned to the men's team.

773
00:37:16.458 --> 00:37:19.500
if you add that all up.

774
00:37:19.583 --> 00:37:25.500
the women have made more
than the men's team for USSF.

775
00:37:25.583 --> 00:37:29.708
The highest TV ratings in this
country for any soccer game

776
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:32.541
has been the championship game
in the World Cup

777
00:37:32.625 --> 00:37:34.625

778
00:37:34.708 --> 00:37:37.250
not a game of the men's team.

779
00:37:37.333 --> 00:37:38.791
And then they say.

780
00:37:38.875 --> 00:37:42.333
well. the woman agreed
to the agreement they have.

781
00:37:42.416 --> 00:37:44.250
they agreed
to their compensation.

782
00:37:44.333 --> 00:37:47.166
so why should they complain.
they accepted it.

783
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.666
The problem with that

784
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:52.166
is they were never presented
the men's deal.

785
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.166
They agreed
to the best agreement

786
00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:57.000
presented to them at that time.

787
00:37:57.083 --> 00:38:00.500
Had they been paid
under the men's agreement

788
00:38:00.583 --> 00:38:02.250
at the same rates.

789
00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:05.708
these women together would have
made far more money.

790
00:38:05.791 --> 00:38:10.583
We believe the number is
in excess of $60 million more

791

for the last four years.

792
00:38:13.083 --> 00:38:18.083
So this is not a question
of apples and oranges.

793
00:38:18.166 --> 00:38:23.541
This is a question of women
doing the same job as the men

you know. late at night.
after games. on weekends.

1071
00:51:31.458 --> 00:51:34.666
when these players. you know.
have been spending

1072
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:39.666
100 percent of their energy
succeeding on the field.

1073
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:42.208
We knew that we needed
to get the attention

1074
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:47.416

and so we wrote a letter.

We finished the letter
really late at night.

wherever they were

00:52:08.583 --> 00:52:13.083
and got them to take photos
of their signature

1083
00:52:13.166 --> 00:52:16.791
and send it to us in a PDF.

it's just one hour of a night.

in the midst
of hard-fought litigation.

1126
00:54:10.083 --> 00:54:12.833
that we would sit down
and find common ground

1127
00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:15.791
and hammer out a solution.

1128
00:54:15.875 --> 00:54:19.791
Everybody cleared
their schedules for three days.

1129
00:54:19.875 --> 00:54:21.875
and we were promised that

1130
00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:24.333
at the very beginning
of the conversation.

1131
00:54:24.416 --> 00:54:27.625
U.S. Soccer would give us
a proposal for equal pay.

1132
00:54:27.708 --> 00:54:29.625
RAPINOE: It's straight.

1133
00:54:29.708 --> 00:54:31.666
I mean. at any point.
we can settle

1134
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:33.333
throughout the entire thing.

1135
00:54:33.416 --> 00:54:34.708
I don't think anyone
wants this to continue

1136
00:54:34.791 --> 00:54:39.000
any longer than it has to.
but I would like. um. yeah.

1137
00:54:39.083 --> 00:54:44.125
I would like there to be a fair
settlement that. like. you know.

1138
00:54:44.208 --> 00:54:47.208

us the appropriate back pay

for the discrimination
that we face

1140
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:52.375

going forward

You know. it's kind of like

1168
00:56:50.041 --> 00:56:53.291
LEVINSON: What's so concerning
is the players just feel

1169
00:56:53.375 --> 00:56:55.958
this absolute lack of respect

00:56:56.041 --> 00:56:58.166

a lot of these people are men.

01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:21.375
from the past president
of U.S. Soccer. Sunil Gulati.

1531
01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:25.166
is that when the women asked
for equal pay

1532
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:31.708
in collective bargaining
through their union in 2016.

1533
01:14:31.791 --> 01:14:35.708
they admitted.
and this was testimony

1534
01:14:35.791 --> 01:14:38.875
from a variety of officials.

1535
01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:44.625
they admitted that they refused
to provide such equal pay.

1536
01:14:44.708 --> 01:14:46.125
and that's very important.

1537
01:14:46.208 --> 01:14:50.375
They never offered the women
the same deal as the men.

1538
01:14:50.458 --> 01:14:53.041
We thought this was
very powerful evidence.

1539
01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:56.666

put into the record

finished working out

1867
01:33:05.208 --> 01:33:09.583

and saw a text from Sam.

1868
01:33:09.666 --> 01:33:13.750

or sound good.

1869
01:33:13.833 --> 01:33:15.916
SAUERBRUNN: And I'm thinking
she maybe meant that text

for somebody else.

1871
01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:19.500

1907
01:35:45.041 --> 01:35:47.666

1909

You can't look

1918

you have to look
at rate of pay.

1919
01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:41.583
It just doesn't fundamentally
make sense in my mind

1920
01:36:41.666 --> 01:36:43.541

there's a dispute

1926
01:36:59.458 --> 01:37:02.333
A jury should decide
that dispute.

1927
01:37:02.416 --> 01:37:07.000
and so I think it's most likely
that the Ninth Circuit would say

1928
01:37:07.083 --> 01:37:10.916
there are disputes
as to a number of the facts

1929
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.958
that the judge
decided were undisputed

1935
01:37:31.833 --> 01:37:33.375
and it's going to take
a lot more than this

1936
01:37:33.458 --> 01:37:36.625
to stop us in our tracks.

1937
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.541
SAUERBRUNN: I always thought at.

1938
01:37:42.625 --> 01:37:47.208
from the very beginning of this
that even if we came out of this

1939
01:37:47.291 --> 01:37:52.541
and we went to trial
and we lost jury decision.

1940
01:37:52.625 --> 01:37:56.541
that there was so much
significance in the fight

1941
01:37:56.625 --> 01:38:01.083
and so much importance.
and so...

1942
01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:02.125
that's what we're going to do.

1943
01:38:02.208 --> 01:38:03.791
We're going to continue
to fight.

1944
01:38:03.875 --> 01:38:07.458
KESSLER: There are a lot
of young women and girls

01:38:09.916 --> 01:38:12.166
looking up to all of us
in this case.

1947
01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:13.583
No one wants to let them down.

1948
01:38:13.666 --> 01:38:15.541
so we're not going
to let them down.

1949
01:38:15.625 --> 01:38:16.958
We're going to keep fighting.

1950
01:38:17.041 --> 01:38:18.458
SAUERBRUNN: It's not over.

1951
01:38:18.541 --> 01:38:22.000
and I know I'm convicted
in my heart that it's not over.

1952
01:38:23.375 --> 01:38:24.916
And that's a good feeling.

1953
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.791
Shitty day. but a good feeling.

1954
01:38:47.083 --> 01:38:51.666
RAPINOE: So. what the judge
said was that first of all.

1955
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:54.000
we agreed to the deal

1956
01:38:54.083 --> 01:38:56.666
and it turned out
to be not as good.

1957
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:59.208
and so you can't just agree
to something

1958
01:38:59.291 --> 01:39:01.291
and then it doesn't turn out
the way you like it

1959
01:39:01.375 --> 01:39:04.750
or the way you want it.
and so then you go back on it.

1960
01:39:04.833 --> 01:39:08.916
Obviously. the point that
the judge. I feel like. missed

1961
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.333
was that we never
had the opportunity

1962
01:39:11.416 --> 01:39:13.375
to agree to the same deal.

1963
01:39:13.458 --> 01:39:15.541
so the men got to. you know.

1964
01:39:15.625 --> 01:39:17.833
do their negotiating
on the top floor.

1965
01:39:17.916 --> 01:39:20.291
and we started
in the parking lot.

1966
01:39:26.916 --> 01:39:28.875
And then also
what Judge Klausner said

1967
01:39:28.958 --> 01:39:35.208
was over the course of.
you know. X amount of years.

1968
01:39:35.291 --> 01:39:40.000
we actually made more money
than the men.

1969
01:39:40.083 --> 01:39:43.291
and which. dollar for dollar.
that is true.

1970
01:39:43.375 --> 01:39:47.666
which is actually a testament
to how successful we have been.

1971
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:51.375
Say we made $100 in that year.

1972
01:39:51.458 --> 01:39:54.208
we had to win nine games
to make $100.

1973
01:39:54.291 --> 01:39:58.041
and the men made $90.
but they had to win three games.

1974
01:39:58.125 --> 01:40:00.583
so we still.
yes. made more money.

1975
01:40:00.666 --> 01:40:03.208
but we worked twice as hard.

1976
01:40:03.291 --> 01:40:07.208
SPANGLER: If the fundamental
notion is that.

1977
01:40:07.291 --> 01:40:10.666
in order for us to be paid
equally going forward.

1978
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:16.291
we have to win more and we have
to win at the highest levels.

1979
01:40:16.375 --> 01:40:22.750
the kind of pressure that
that puts on them is. um.

1980
01:40:22.833 --> 01:40:25.583
quite frankly. I don't think
it's remotely lawful.

1981
01:40:25.666 --> 01:40:28.375
