00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.330
- [Narrator] An attorney called
him "a thug for the Lord."

5
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.580
His daughter dubbed him
"the rescue machine."

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.690
To those who loved him. he was a hero.

7
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.260
A tough. tenacious.
cantankerous. lovable hero.

8
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.640
A proud Marine who took the heart both on

9
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.823
and off the bench the motto.
"Leave no one behind".

10
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.930
To his critics. he was
a bleeding heart liberal

11
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.180
on the notorious Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals.

12
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.750
a would-be social engineer.
a judicial activist

13
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.283
who ruled with his heart
instead of his head.

14
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.994
He was a judge for over 50 years.

15
00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:45.657
When he died still on the
bench at 94. it was said.

16
00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:49.730
"In the field of law and public
interest. there are stars.

17
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.730
there are superstars and then
there's Harry Pregerson."

18
00:01:02.924 --> 00:01:06.840
(relaxed violin music)

19
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.530
- This morning. Harry's family and I laid

20
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.770
his body to rest at the
VA Cemetery in Westwood.

21
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.170
We said Kaddish for
his soul and we laughed

22
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.230
at the certainty with
which we knew that Harry

23
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.790
after surveying his new surroundings

24
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.220
would have said. "It's about time.

25
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.703
I have always wanted to
live on the Westside."

26
00:01:30.703 --> 00:01:32.340
(audience laughs)

27
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.930
That was Harry.

28
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.283
Funny as hell.

29
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.120
He did not care about
convention or much else.

30
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.530
other than living in the
best tradition of the Hebrew

31
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.530
prophets who railed against
oppression and hypocrisy

32
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.450
and stupidity and anything
or anyone that subverted

33
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.733
the rights of the poor or the
powerless or the vulnerable.

34
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.033
- We all recognize this. right?

35
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.440
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

36
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.520
First of all. I want to thank you all

37
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.290
for coming today to honor my dad.

38
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.670
I loved him so much.

39
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.130
I have to tell you. he was the best father

40
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.980
in the entire world and
I know you loved him too.

41
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.980
On the night that he passed
away. I sat in his office.

42
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.860
At first glance when you walk in.

43
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.050
it looks like Hurricane
Katrina just blew through it.

44
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.480
There are papers everywhere.

45
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.280
There's books everywhere.
pictures. mementos.

46
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.850
You name it. it's all stuffed into this

47
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.420
very messy office and
you could learn a lot

48
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.973
from him just studying
what was on those shelves.

49
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.200
As I went through his desk.
I found hundreds of letters.

50
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.773
handwritten notes and cards.

51
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.760
There were lots and lots of pictures.

52
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.723
mostly pictures of my
beautiful mother. Bern.

53
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.290
There were pictures of
my brother Dean and I.

54
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.510
There were pictures of
the late Congressman

55
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.920
Jim Corman. who was very dear to him.

56
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.930
Pictures of guys he
served within the Marines

57
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.100
and finally pictures of
lots and lots of people

58
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.610
in this audience from the
Bell Shelter or the Courthouse

59
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.640
or any one of the hundreds
of charity events that

60
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.820
he was schlepping to almost
every night of the week.

61
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.800
If you really wanted to
understand what made my dad tick.

62
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.750
all you had to do was sit in that office.

63
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.240
- Robert Alton Harris was strapped

64
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.670
in a chair in the gas chamber.

65
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.190
The acid bath was filling beneath him

66
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.240
and then the telephone rang.

67
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.080
- [Newswoman] That's when Federal

68
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.930
Appeals Judge Harry Pregerson jumped in.

69
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.540
- Evidently Federal Courts have ruled

70
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.120
that San Diego County can
make welfare applicants

71
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.620
submit to unannounced
searches of their homes.

72
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.127
Bleeding heart judges
called San Diego's program

73
00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:56.600
"shameful." an "attack on the poor."

74
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.280
One of them added "The government does not

75
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.120
search through the closets and medicine

76
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.420
cabinets of farmers receiving subsidies.

77
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.870
They do not dig through the
laundry baskets and garbage

78
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.580
pails of real estate developers
or radio broadcasters."

79
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.320
Of course not. because those
people aren't on welfare.

80
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.530
They receive corporate
subsidies. totally different.

81
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.750
The Federal Appeals Court
based in San Francisco has

82
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.480
refused to reinstate President
Trump's immigration order.

83
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.000
- [Newswoman] President Trump's travel ban

84
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.524
met its end at the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals.

85
00:04:29.524 --> 00:04:30.550
- [Protesters] The people united-

86
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.260
- [Newswoman] By this
afternoon. the President

87
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.610
was telling The Washington
Examiner he would

88
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.570
absolutely consider breaking
up the Ninth Circuit.

89
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.050
- You go to the Ninth
Circuit and it's a disgrace

90
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.570
and I'm gonna put in a major complaint

91
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.020
because you cannot win.
if you're us. a case

92
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.049
in the Ninth Circuit and
I think it's a disgrace.

93
00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:50.500
- [Harry] I'm not gonna sign
any order that's gonna have

94
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.340
the effect of kicking out of
this country kids who were

95
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.120
born here and who have the
birthright as American citizens.

96
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.486
I'm just not gonna do it because
I think it's morally wrong.

97
00:05:02.486 --> 00:05:05.450
(soft piano music)

98
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.800
My father was born in the Ukraine

99
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.263
in a village called Kusrilla.

100
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.603
He came here about 1904
and he landed in Boston.

101
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.177
Ended up working in Chicago
and then the War came

102
00:05:20.177 --> 00:05:23.080
and he was drafted in the American Army

103
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.260
and was in the Saint-Mihiel
and Meuse-Argonne

104
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.783
campaigns and he was badly wounded.

105
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.410
My mother came here as the young girl.

106
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.167
She lived in Philadelphia and worked

107
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:38.550
in one of the sweatshops
for like $3 a week.

108
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.451
They met here in Los Angeles.

109
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:42.748
(upbeat trumpet music)

110
00:05:42.748 --> 00:05:46.060
It was up real hustling. bustling place.

111
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.393
People moving up and down the street.

112
00:05:48.393 --> 00:05:52.260
the Five & Dime and the
pool halls. delicatessens.

113
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.260
creameries. bakeries. all the
great smells. the markets.

114
00:05:57.314 --> 00:05:58.810
You had poultry stores where

115
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.760
the live chickens would running around.

116
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.917
We lived on Sea View Avenue
for the first 12 years

117
00:06:04.917 --> 00:06:07.700
and it was heavily Jewish
but not completely.

118
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.640
There were many Japanese families.

119
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.235
Mexican families. Slavs. Italians.

120
00:06:14.235 --> 00:06:17.282
It was heavily Italian too.

121
00:06:17.282 --> 00:06:20.204
In grammar school. junior
high school. high school.

122
00:06:20.204 --> 00:06:23.790
there was always an emphasis
on respect for others.

123
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.400
respect for others' cultural
backgrounds. religious beliefs.

124
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.140
This was emphasized.

125
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.057
In my high school. we had
52 different ethnic groups

126
00:06:33.057 --> 00:06:36.487
but everybody got along and
that was very important.

127
00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:41.790
- [Interviewer] Did you
experience any anti-Semitism?

128
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.890
- [Harry] These kids. I
think they were Mexican.

129
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.810
they asked me "Well. like what are you?"

130
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.367
So I said "I'm a boy."

131
00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:50.223
"No. no. no. we want to know
whether you're a Jew or not."

132
00:06:50.223 --> 00:06:52.010
I said "Yeah" and then they

133
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.883
wanted to know why I killed Christ.

134
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.360
Then I worked for The
Broadway in Pasadena.

135
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.010
That was a good job because
that paid like $5 a day.

136
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.350
I was there for a few days

137
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.140
and they found out I was
Jewish and they fired me.

138
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.614
- [Interviewer] That was
really your first experience?

139
00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:09.849
- [Harry] That was the real
first experience. yeah.

140
00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:11.114
- [Interviewer] When did you first

141
00:07:11.114 --> 00:07:13.190
begin to think about being a lawyer?

142
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.070
- [Harry] Well. I think it
all came from my father.

143
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.720
He used to go and listen
to Darrow in Chicago.

144
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.840
He had Darrow's debates
on capital punishment

145
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.050
and from earliest childhood.

146
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.850
I knew I was gonna go to law school.

147
00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:31.341
(upbeat carnival music)

148
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:33.874
I used to go to the Ocean Park Pier.

149
00:07:33.874 --> 00:07:36.685
There were a lot of fishermen on the wharf

150
00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:39.317
and this guy's caught a big one

151
00:07:39.317 --> 00:07:41.760
and it's on the ground. so it's flopping.

152
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.833
I just ran over and threw
it back in the ocean.

153
00:07:46.303 --> 00:07:49.582
Well the guy was mad as hell.
it was probably his supper.

154
00:07:49.582 --> 00:07:51.553
So the guy starts to run after me.

155
00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:55.133
But I just couldn't leave that boy alone.

156
00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:58.450
He was a humanitarian. but
I'll never forget that.

157
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.620
- All of us were the
center of Harry's universe.

158
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.420
He made sure that I felt like
a girl who could do anything.

159
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.490
who was tough. who had the fortitude

160
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.530
to really take care of
myself. to weather any storm.

161
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.950
A turning point came when I was in

162
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.900
the seventh grade and my mom announced

163
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.700
that she was going back to
school to study microbiology.

164
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.370
Bern told Harry that he needed to step up

165
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.270
to the plate and assume
some responsibilities

166
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.330
of parenting and because
my dad was totally

167
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.260
helpless in the kitchen.
we went out every night.

168
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.670
Over dinner. he would tell me

169
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.610
what a mediocre student he was.

170
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.610
By far and away. the brightest

171
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.550
in the class were always the girls.

172
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.850
He'd say. "And what
happened to those girls?"

173
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.390
Well. those girls got
married out of high school.

174
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.210
they put their husbands through college

175
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.650
put 'em through graduate school.

176
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.440
raised the kids and then what happened?

177
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.343
Sometimes the husband would die.

178
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.800
Sometimes.

179
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.620
the husband would get bored

180
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.790
and the marriage would end in divorce

181
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.200
and it was too late for
the woman at that point

182
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.870
in her life to start
over and have a career.

183
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.900
It bothered him so much

184
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.550
that these women never had an opportunity

185
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.900
to really live up to their potential

186
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.220
and then he'd tell me. "That's why Katie.

187
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.700
you need to get a good education.

188
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.930
You need to be your own boss.

189
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.680
You need to make your own money.

190
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.530
You need to determine
your own destiny. even if

191
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.170
you're lucky enough to marry
the man of your dreams."

192
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.570
- What was it like to grow up with Harry?

193
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:49.460
Just imagine you're a barely
literate young teenager.

194
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.760
You are happily reading "The
Hardy Boys" mystery series.

195
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.230
maybe watching a little "Sea Hunt" on TV.

196
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.897
Harry strides up and hands you a poem.

197
00:09:59.897 --> 00:10:04.033
"Read it. it's called 'Invictus.'"

198
00:10:04.033 --> 00:10:05.675
(audience laughs)

199
00:10:05.675 --> 00:10:07.176
"But why?"

200
00:10:07.176 --> 00:10:08.276
"It builds character."

201
00:10:10.157 --> 00:10:12.800
"Out of the night that covers me.

202
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.710
black as the pit from pole to pole.

203
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:20.710
I thank whatever gods may be
for my unconquerable soul.

204
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.770
In the fell clutch of circumstance.

205
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.600
I have not winced nor cried aloud.

206
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.230
Under the bludgeonings of chance.

207
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.223
my head is bloody but unbowed.

208
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.360
Beyond this place of wrath and tears

209
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.170
looms but the horror of the shade

210
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.690
and yet the menace of the years

211
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.520
finds and shall find me unafraid.

212
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.250
It matters not how strait the gate.

213
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.053
how charged with punishments the scroll.

214
00:10:51.053 --> 00:10:54.170
I am the master of my fate.

215
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.653
I am the captain of my soul."

216
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.930
When Harry was working
his way through UCLA

217
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.780
washing dishes at
fraternities and sororities.

218
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.350
he decided that he was gonna
run for Student Body President.

219
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.060
Those were different times.

220
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.563
Anti-Semitism was not in the shadows.

221
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.940
There were restrictive
covenants and deeds.

222
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.110
Some schools had quotas.

223
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.380
private clubs had Jews
not allowed policies.

224
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.310
anti-Semitic slogans
and jokes were common.

225
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.530
No one who was Jewish had ever been

226
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.050
elected Student Body President of UCLA.

227
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.260
The other side smeared Harry. his heritage

228
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.200
and just said terrible.
terrible things about him.

229
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.677
Harry in despair went
to see the campus Rabbi.

230
00:11:40.677 --> 00:11:43.210
"What should I do. Rabbi?" he asked.

231
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:47.190
The Rabbi said one word.
a word that carried

232
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.683
Harry through the rest
of his life. "Fight."

233
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.382
Harry the dishwasher
won by a good landslide.

234
00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:59.412
(anxious trumpet music)

235
00:11:59.412 --> 00:12:02.495
(explosions booming)

236
00:12:04.287 --> 00:12:09.110
It was 1944. the survival
of America was at stake.

237
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.910
Harry enlisted in the
Marine Corps and soon

238
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.463
found himself in Officer's
Training in Quantico. Virginia.

239
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.910
Harry and three of his Marine

240
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.510
buddies are sent to the Pacific.

241
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.903
One is killed. one loses
an eye and one a leg.

242
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.230
For Harry. it meant Okinawa.

243
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:32.740
More than 200.000 perished
in the 82-day struggle.

244
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.300
twice the number of
Japanese lost at Hiroshima

245
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.709
and more American blood than
had been shed at Gettysburg.

246
00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:44.709
(anxious violin. trumpet music)

247
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.370
It's May 3rd. 1945.

248
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.660
Harry is wounded both ways by bullets

249
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.303
from a machine gun shooting
Dum Dum exploding rounds.

250
00:12:55.303 --> 00:12:58.090
He's able to like flat
in a small depression

251
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.420
of dirt while ordinance
flies in both directions.

252
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.360
He slows the bleeding by using

253
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.490
his belt and clothing as tourniquets.

254
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.187
Through that long night alone. he hears

255
00:13:09.187 --> 00:13:12.330
"Marine. tonight you die.

256
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.490
Marine. tonight you die."

257
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.590
At dawn. two guys run
through hell to get him.

258
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.990
They dropped him several times
sliding down embankments.

259
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.240
trying to escape. trying to stay alive

260
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.100
and this is where we remember that Harry

261
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.860
is from East LA and proud of it.

262
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.520
His friends were working class Latinos.

263
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.820
Jews. Asians. Italians.
Irish. you name it.

264
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.280
The guys that saved his life
were the Martinez cousins.

265
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.433
He didn't know them. but he knew them.

266
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.150
They were just like his buddies
from the old neighborhood.

267
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.603
The greatest guys in the world.

268
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.920
(anxious violin tones)

269
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:59.661
(somber trumpet music)

270
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.410
Harry had spent about a year

271
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.150
at the Naval Hospital in San Diego.

272
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:12.020
His weight went up from
110 to a healthy 175.

273
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.690
He had a limp and he had a cane.

274
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:18.250
One day. he was playing pool
with one of his buddies.

275
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.120
Harry said "Hey. do you know
any girls I could meet?"

276
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.040
His friend said "Well you
know. I'm going on a date

277
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.020
with this girl and I'll ask
if she has any friends."

278
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.000
Well. this car drives
up and Bern is sitting

279
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.430
in the front seat with
Harry's friend who's driving.

280
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.920
Harry opens the door. looks at Bern.

281
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.580
looks at his date in the back seat

282
00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.647
and he sits in the front seat.

283
00:14:45.647 --> 00:14:48.480
(audience laughs)

284
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.930
Is anyone surprised?

285
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.770
And from that day forward.

286
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.620
he knew he was going to marry her.

287
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.610
- When I first met Harry.
he was on crutches.

288
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.010
He was this handsome Marine

289
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.861
and what could be more
romantic than a handsome

290
00:15:07.861 --> 00:15:11.143
Marine on crutches to an 18 year old girl?

291
00:15:12.101 --> 00:15:14.550
It was after about five or six times

292
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.380
that I had gone out with Harry.

293
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.850
I said "What do you want
to do with your life?"

294
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.017
And he said without a minute's hesitation.

295
00:15:22.017 --> 00:15:24.010
"Oh. I want to help people."

296
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.350
And he said. "So I'm
gonna go to law school

297
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.407
and acquire the tools that
I'll need to do that."

298
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.970
My background was living in Boyle Heights

299
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.630
during the Depression.
growing up very poor.

300
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.510
My father never had a permanent job.

301
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.210
In fact. most of the time
he didn't have a job at all.

302
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:51.210
He was a mechanic and they
were not hiring mechanics

303
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.650
and so there were six
children and sometimes

304
00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.650
it was lean pickings when it came to food

305
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.700
and I felt poor

306
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.700
and so when I went to UCLA
the semester I met Harry.

307
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.800
I couldn't believe how
beautiful those homes

308
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.580
were around UCLA and I thought to myself

309
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.130
you know. I'd really like one of those.

310
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.260
So when Harry said he
wanted to help people

311
00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.163
and I'm thinking about
those beautiful houses.

312
00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.730
it didn't seem to me. as
naive as I was. that maybe

313
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:34.510
helping people was not such
a money-making proposition.

314
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.030
That maybe those houses would be out

315
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.410
of range with Harry
working on helping people.

316
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.070
But I thought it was such an unusual thing

317
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.890
for him to say and when I
dated him more and more.

318
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.390
I realized that I would
probably never meet

319
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:54.240
anybody as unique as
this man and so that's

320
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.363
when I decided that maybe
this was the guy for me.

321
00:16:59.334 --> 00:17:03.834
(up tempo Jewish style wedding music)

322
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.170
Harry took any case that
came through the door

323
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:17.670
and I mean any case. he
did wills for maybe $10.

324
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.890
Never thought about billable hours.

325
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.920
just whatever they could pay.

326
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.380
I remember Harry coming
home with a package

327
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.460
of chicken legs or we got a free tire.

328
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.980
It never occurred to him to limit himself

329
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.880
to people of position. people of influence

330
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.720
and that's when he first
embarked on the idea of

331
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.720
trying to find a way for the
little guy to be represented.

332
00:17:43.889 --> 00:17:46.010
- In the late 50s. I got to hanging around

333
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.600
with what was then the neighborhood gang.

334
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.340
My mother's optometrist
was Dr. Edward Lamar

335
00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.110
and every afternoon
from about 2:00 to 4:00.

336
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.060
he'd put an out to lunch sign

337
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.750
and him and his receptionist would

338
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.290
basically have a lovemaking
session in the afternoons

339
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.480
with their lunch and
so we knew that the car

340
00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.450
wasn't going anywhere
for at least two hours.

341
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.000
So we actually went joyriding twice

342
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.870
before the third time. we got caught.

343
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.820
Detectives came that evening to the house

344
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.410
and told my dad that they
knew that I was in the car

345
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:23.590
and after my dad got through straightening

346
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.620
me out with his belt.
we had to go to court

347
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.710
and that's when I met
Harry and he was hard.

348
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.850
I never met somebody that
could scare me like he did.

349
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.000
I still remember one thing he said

350
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
that just kind of stuck with
me and that was that if that's

351
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.490
the kind of life I wanted to
lead. then I wasn't a very

352
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.923
good person and that they
should throw the book at me.

353
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.940
But if I wanted to change.

354
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.560
then the change had to be with me.

355
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.970
It couldn't be anybody else

356
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.080
and I couldn't blame anybody else

357
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.510
and my father made the
comment that he was a Marine

358
00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:02.180
and he was a combat Marine
and a decorated Marine

359
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:06.290
and that Marines didn't
put up with any nonsense.

360
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.480
So that put the idea in my head that maybe

361
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.650
these Marines were a pretty
tough outfit to belong to.

362
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.550
I wanted to be a Marine if
they could make you that tough.

363
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.770
- It was when Jim Corman. the Congressman

364
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.990
who was very close to
Harry said to him one day.

365
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.910
he said. "You know.
you'd make a fine judge."

366
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.440
And he said "I'm going to try

367
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.657
to see whether that's possible."

368
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.050
Pat Brown. who was Governor Brown

369
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.440
was impressed with my husband.

370
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.320
He liked what Harry was doing

371
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.500
and so it just happened
there was an opening.

372
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.710
Harry first became a
Municipal Court Judge.

373
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.170
One year later. he was appointed

374
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.960
to be a Superior Court Judge.

375
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.300
He was appointed to the District Court

376
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.413
by President Lyndon Johnson.

377
00:19:55.635 --> 00:19:58.552
(gunfire clacking)

378
00:19:59.642 --> 00:20:01.607
(explosion booms)

379
00:20:01.607 --> 00:20:05.340
Harry was torn when it came to Vietnam.

380
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.030
He felt that everybody should serve

381
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:11.903
but he understood why
others didn't feel that way.

382
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.620
- The War was just heating up
when I got out of high school

383
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.430
and you could go into college.
you could get a deferment

384
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.980
and avoid going in the service at all

385
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.930
and so I took that deferment
and I went to college.

386
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:29.030
not necessarily because
I wanted to go to college

387
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.340
but because I could get a deferment.

388
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.750
A couple of years down the
line when the War began getting

389
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.883
worse. I decided I had to
take personal responsibility

390
00:20:37.883 --> 00:20:40.990
for my position on the War
and that I had sort of white

391
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.050
privilege going to school
when other kids couldn't.

392
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.970
So I sent in my 2-S
and they made me a 1-A.

393
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.050
They called me for a physical

394
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:54.863
and I refused to take the
physical and then I was indicted.

395
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.120
When they said "The People
of the United States

396
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.630
of America versus Robert Paul Zaugh."

397
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.910
I felt this huge wave of adrenal fear

398
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.640
jolt me and pass through my body

399
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.230
and once it did. I was not nervous.

400
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:15.520
The Judge didn't have to
let you defend yourself.

401
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.847
They could just keep it to

402
00:21:16.847 --> 00:21:20.380
"Did you refuse induction or did you not?"

403
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.980
It's a yes or no answer

404
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.360
and that could be the end of your case.

405
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.230
Even though the prosecutor
objected to my presentation.

406
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:32.190
Pregerson said. "I want to hear
what Mr. Zaugh has to say."

407
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.640
So I spoke for. I don't know. 20 minutes.

408
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.727
He acquitted me of refusing induction

409
00:21:37.727 --> 00:21:40.550
and he convicted me of
refusing to take a physical.

410
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:44.170
He sentenced me to work
in the national interest.

411
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.010
I told them that I was
working at Peace Press.

412
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:52.030
that we printed for Angela
Davis. Daniel Ellsberg.

413
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.770
the Communist Party. the
Black Panthers. et cetera

414
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.900
and that that was the
national interest and that's

415
00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.680
what I was going to do and
they never challenged that.

416
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.440
I thought perhaps it was my so-called

417
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.930
brilliant defense that
had kept me out of prison.

418
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:13.560
But what Pregerson said was
that he visits everybody

419
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.920
he sends to prison and
that he went up to Lompoc

420
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.480
to visit a bank robber and he looked on

421
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.920
the prison manifest and he
saw the name of Mike Swartz.

422
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.400
He thought Schwartz was picking
corn in Safford. Arizona.

423
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.070
the minimum security prison

424
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.040
that most resisters were sent to.

425
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.240
It wasn't my argument that got me off.

426
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.950
It was one. he didn't like the conditions

427
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.550
in that prison and two.
he realized how serious

428
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.700
the draft resisters were
about what they were doing

429
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.250
and he decided personally he was not gonna

430
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.310
send any more draft resisters to prison

431
00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.247
and lo and behold. I was the next case.

432
00:22:52.247 --> 00:22:55.580
(relaxed guitar music)

433
00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.780
- They came home. they had to find a job.

434
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.080
Many of them had been gone
for a number of years.

435
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.080
They hadn't had training
to move into the mainstream

436
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.610
and so many of them
wound up on the streets.

437
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.370
They were homeless and they were needing

438
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.230
help and nobody was giving them help.

439
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.090
So Harry just went crazy over that idea

440
00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.370
that you have people
serving. putting their life

441
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:29.340
on the line. as he saw all these men do.

442
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.173
Marines

443
00:23:31.714 --> 00:23:34.390
and Navy and Army guys

444
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:38.377
and gals and he said. "How
can you treat them so poorly?"

445
00:23:40.193 --> 00:23:43.510
- In Los Angeles alone. there
were about 24.000 homeless

446
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:47.620
veterans and he really took
it to heart that these guys

447
00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.420
were out on the street and
they and they couldn't get help

448
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.370
and tears came to his eyes.

449
00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.820
just showing that he cared
deeply about everyone.

450
00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.820
about every veteran who wasn't
being helped in the world.

451
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.580
Harry and I really
connected early on in that.

452
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.640
He found out that I was a Marine.

453
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.950
We are taught to protect those around us.

454
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.960
We become a unit and we
watch each other's back.

455
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.490
which in combat is absolutely essential.

456
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.400
So he identified a building. he found

457
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.240
the people who would give the
down payment on the building.

458
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.370
He really put together

459
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.373
the building blocks of
what became US Vets.

460
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.450
Our workers go out into the streets.

461
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.280
go under the bridges. by the freeways

462
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.090
and when they see an
encampment of homeless people.

463
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:36.960
they'll say. "Are any of you veterans?"

464
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.960
- Are you a veteran?

465
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.150
You got any vets out here?

466
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.943
And Army. Navy. Marines?
- Army.

467
00:24:48.395 --> 00:24:49.897
- Are you a veteran by any chance?

468
00:24:49.897 --> 00:24:50.980
Are you a United States veteran?

469
00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:55.800
- Once be bring them in. we
assess them. try to determine

470
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.530
what are those things that
led them to homelessness?

471
00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.460
- We got guys that just got out

472
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.297
of the military last year. you know?

473
00:25:06.722 --> 00:25:11.157
We have from World War II all the way up.

474
00:25:11.157 --> 00:25:14.103
(plane humming)

475
00:25:14.103 --> 00:25:17.783
The only family they have is
right here. this community.

476
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.970
- You see. it started 35 years ago.

477
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:24.580
Harry was watching
television and on the news.

478
00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.160
the Salvation Army was managing

479
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.980
a homeless shelter. a cold winter shelter.

480
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.560
It was a very bleak and cold winter

481
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.680
and many of the homeless
were dying on the streets.

482
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.090
The city announced that the shelter would

483
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.270
be closed and that the
Salvation Army would cease

484
00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.983
to manage it because there
were no more funds left.

485
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:47.580
They asked my father. "What are
these homeless going to do?"

486
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.620
And he says. "They're gonna probably

487
00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.447
have to go back to
sleeping on the streets."

488
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.860
Well. Harry saw that
interview on television

489
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.770
and just within about
an hour after my father

490
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:03.510
got back to his office. he
got a phone call from Harry

491
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.240
and you know that when you
get a phone call from Harry.

492
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.840
something's about to happen.
something's going to be done

493
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.570
and it's probably gonna
challenge you to do

494
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.400
a lot more than you ever
thought you were gonna do.

495
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.300
The Judge drove him down to Bell.

496
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.010
government land that wasn't being used.

497
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.920
He said. "What could you do with this?"

498
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.170
500 men and women from
that day forward were

499
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:29.265
housed at this complex
because Harry made it happen.

500
00:26:29.265 --> 00:26:31.830
(relaxed guitar music)

501
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.250
- [Harry] If you want to
meet wonderful people.

502
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.990
kind people. sharing
people. decent people.

503
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.200
you go to a homeless shelter
and you sit down with them.

504
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.670
They'll share whatever they
have with the next person.

505
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.450
They're concerned about others' problems.

506
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.320
There's so much talent there.

507
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.470
We've had lawyers who were homeless.

508
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.810
We've had bankers who were homeless.

509
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.720
We've had NBA basketball players.

510
00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.810
We've had a lot of folks that

511
00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:02.170
are just struggling to survive every day.

512
00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.550
They come to our place
and we have a total array

513
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.633
of programs to help 'em
get back on their feet.

514
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.990
- When the Pregerson family

515
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.023
asked me to share a few reflections.

516
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.850
I wanted to speak from my
heart and think of what's

517
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:23.340
the truest thing I can say
to honor this magnificent man

518
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.330
and it occurred to me
it is somewhat ironic

519
00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.910
that as a Catholic and
Christian. the person

520
00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:32.350
who most has reminded me
of Jesus on my journey

521
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.950
was a man of Jewish persuasion named Harry

522
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.180
and I had mentioned this to my wife.

523
00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.470
my most honest critic. Denise.

524
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.130
She said "No. you're not gonna say that.

525
00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.430
First of all. Jesus was a Jew.

526
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.680
You're gonna sound like an ignorant

527
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.900
Catholic boy who doesn't know his history.

528
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.250
You're not gonna say that."

529
00:27:49.151 --> 00:27:51.560
It kinda reminded me of those
moments when you've been

530
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.280
at those events that honor
Harry and as was mentioned.

531
00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.960
he has a tendency to kinda go on and on

532
00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.120
with his enthusiasm and so finally Bern

533
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.080
pops up and says "Harry. get down.

534
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.120
you're done. get off the stage."

535
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.400
God bless our wives.

536
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.210
Harry recognized that as devastating

537
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.513
as material poverty can be.

538
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:16.430
it is the disconnection
from a community of care

539
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:20.483
that most depresses the plights
of our homeless neighbors.

540
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.590
I am convinced that this is
why the individual attention

541
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.490
he devoted to the poor and
powerless surpassed that

542
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.913
which he directed to the
powerful and the elite.

543
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:37.040
His message to the homeless
was you deserve more

544
00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:42.910
and I believe in you. don't
give up on your dreams.

545
00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.517
The message he conveyed
to the powerful was

546
00:28:45.517 --> 00:28:49.658
you need to do more or I won't
believe in you because you'll

547
00:28:49.658 --> 00:28:54.097
be giving up on the dream of
what we must be as a community.

548
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:59.100
- In 1979. Harry was
nominated to the Ninth Circuit

549
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.200
Court of Appeals by
President Jimmy Carter.

550
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.610
He went before the Senate

551
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.193
Judiciary Committee for confirmation.

552
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:12.970
Harry was asked by one of the Senators

553
00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.287
and pushed by one of the Senators.

554
00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:18.180
"What would you do. Judge.

555
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.950
if you had a case in
which you had to decide

556
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.230
according to the law or your conscience?"

557
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.510
And Harry really said afterwards to me

558
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.060
and others that that made
him very uncomfortable

559
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.110
to try to answer a question like that

560
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:39.410
and he finally. because
they pressed him. he finally

561
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:43.700
said "My conscience is the
product of the 10 Commandments.

562
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.800
the Bill of Rights. the Boy Scout Oath

563
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.343
and the Marine Corps Hymn.

564
00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.290
If I had to follow my
conscience or the law.

565
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.277
I would follow my conscience."

566
00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:00.680
Harry could not lie.

567
00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.620
Harry had no guile.

568
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.710
He just was what he was.

569
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.350
People would take him for what he was

570
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.900
and I think everybody recognized
that this was a man of

571
00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:16.690
great

572
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:17.523
honor.

573
00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.962
of great morality. of integrity.

574
00:30:21.962 --> 00:30:25.545
(soft piano. violin music)

575
00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.060
- I was asked to speak on behalf

576
00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:59.890
of HP's law clerks past and present.

577
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.670
There are over 150 of us

578
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:06.050
over his 45 years on the Federal bench.

579
00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.580
He has sworn most of us

580
00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.230
into the Bar and into other positions.

581
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:13.150
Since he's been a Circuit
Judge. he has taken

582
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.413
the liberty of embellishing
the State Bar Oath.

583
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.387
He adds the promise. which
he makes us all repeat.

584
00:31:21.387 --> 00:31:24.761
"I will never file an oversized brief."

585
00:31:24.761 --> 00:31:27.250
(audience laughs)

586
00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.490
He bragged about other people's kids

587
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.463
and shared pictures as
if they were his own.

588
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.760
He took the cane. an
item that some might view

589
00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.510
as a symbol of weakness and
made it powerful and fun.

590
00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.690
He used to do tricks with his cane.

591
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:46.970
HP regularly hired female
law clerks from the get-go.

592
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.160
long before many of his colleagues

593
00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.970
would even consider such
a hire and if you got

594
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.100
pregnant while you were
working for him. no problem.

595
00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.300
Just bring the crib in.

596
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.413
He had it all set up as a nursery.

597
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.030
He was always on the phone.

598
00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:04.900
moving and shaking. wheeling and dealing.

599
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.740
It was so frustrating if
you were trying to keep him

600
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:12.070
on a deadline or help him get
an opinion out but he taught

601
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.710
us how to get amazing things
done by personal contact.

602
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.040
When he saw a wrong that
needed to be righted.

603
00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.520
he gathered the law clerks

604
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.480
and he gave us our marching orders.

605
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.200
Find the law and build
to the right decision.

606
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.400
He said the law is like
going to Builder's Emporium.

607
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.690
figure out what you want to build

608
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.950
and then use the law
as a tool to build it.

609
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.763
And he had amazing legal vision.

610
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.777
His dissent in Sullivan
versus United States in 1985

611
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.770
lamented the failure of the
Court and our government

612
00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:54.713
to recognize the importance of
a party's same-sex marriage.

613
00:32:56.310 --> 00:33:00.270
In 1998 in US versus Lipman.

614
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.680
long before the DACA controversy.

615
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.860
he authored a little-known opinion that

616
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:11.203
gave legal recognition to
real life on the street.

617
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.320
That it is no surprise that children

618
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.040
brought to this country
illegally by their parents

619
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.223
become as American as the rest of us.

620
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.760
- He was obviously incredibly impactful

621
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.120
as a jurist and I think
for two different reasons.

622
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.673
One. he personified idealism.

623
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.863
The law was there to protect people.

624
00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:41.420
It was infused with values.
equality and fairness

625
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.280
but he also was the consummate pragmatist.

626
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.150
He measured whether something was just

627
00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:56.150
based on its actual effect
on real people's lives.

628
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.467
(relaxed piano music)

629
00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.130
- In the mid-80s. it came
to light that the city

630
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.460
of Los Angeles had been
inadequately treating its sewage

631
00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.190
and was essentially
dumping everything that

632
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.293
was flushed down a toilet
into Santa Monica Bay.

633
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.130
- The Hyperion Treatment
Plant was not coming close

634
00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.720
to meeting the requirements
under the Clean Water Act.

635
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.640
We had a dead zone in the
middle of Santa Monica Bay.

636
00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.790
We had sewage spills closing the beaches

637
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.380
even in the height of
summer and people were

638
00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.780
just sick and tired of
the poor water quality.

639
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.530
It was very much under the radar.

640
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.180
Then Assemblyman Tom Hayden held hearings.

641
00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.790
Then all of a sudden. the sorry state

642
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:41.103
of sewage became front page news.

643
00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.360
Judge Pregerson had
been the District Judge

644
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.500
who had been presiding
over the enforcement case.

645
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.990
It then got put on hold for
many. many years and by the time

646
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:54.880
it reopened. he was an Appellate
Court Judge but he kept

647
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.090
on the case because he
already had the experience.

648
00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.250
He required all of us to go on a tour

649
00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.860
of the Hyperion Treatment
Plant and he made sure

650
00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.900
that everybody got up close and personal

651
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.750
to what's known as the headworks.

652
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:08.550
where there are bar screens that screen

653
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.930
out the crazy large items
and things that people dump

654
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.880
into sewers down manholes
and flush down the toilets.

655
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.750
It's the most odorful area.

656
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.160
- [Mark] We ended up
meeting once a quarter.

657
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.530
Judge Harry Pregerson presided
to run those meetings.

658
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.560
- Stuck in a room having
to go through everything.

659
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.230
we started to develop
some honest relationships.

660
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.547
Being able to ask questions. you know.

661
00:35:30.547 --> 00:35:33.130
"Would you let your daughter go swim

662
00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:34.720
in the beach out near the plant?"

663
00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.990
And the answer was no.

664
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.730
- He was so down earth and so folksy

665
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.780
and he just had this incredible way

666
00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.830
of making everybody in
that room feel at ease

667
00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.720
and also feel that their
voice was important.

668
00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.830
We I think realized.
somewhat to our horror.

669
00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.740
that we had approached talking about

670
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:57.850
the men and women of the
Public Works Department

671
00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:59.700
as if the folks who went
to work at the sewage

672
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.260
treatment plant went there
every morning to manufacturer

673
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.210
sewage for the joy of
dumping it in the ocean

674
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.530
as opposed to it being
hardworking men and women

675
00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:10.650
who were dealing with
a river of human waste

676
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:13.210
coming at them 24 hours a
day that they hadn't been

677
00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:16.822
given the resources they
needed to deal with adequately.

678
00:36:16.822 --> 00:36:20.489
(soft piano. trumpet music)

679
00:36:22.493 --> 00:36:25.350
I think Judge Pregerson
and his very humanity

680
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.510
in forcing us to come together
as people to figure out

681
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.410
what could be done as
opposed to fighting in the

682
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:35.283
traditional sense really brought
the best out of all of us.

683
00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.133
- We hear the term activist judge.

684
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.290
That doesn't really encompass

685
00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:08.680
the activist judge that
Harry Pregerson was.

686
00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.930
He taught us it's not
just what you do in law

687
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:13.970
with your hands in the
opinions that you write

688
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.470
but it's what you do with your
feet outside the courtroom.

689
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.130
When a freeway going through
South Los Angeles was going

690
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:24.810
to uproot low income families.
he stopped it in its tracks.

691
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.980
The first time in the history
perhaps of this nation

692
00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.840
that a judge stopped an
infrastructure project

693
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.130
like that out of justice. to
make sure that something that

694
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:38.653
was supposed to serve all of
us did not leave anyone behind.

695
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:42.490
- The Century Freeway was planned

696
00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:47.490
deliberately to go right
through the urban area

697
00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:51.370
and in doing so. it would destroy

698
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:54.803
approximately 8.000 housing units.

699
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.410
We were very young. still very green

700
00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:00.450
and trying to figure out what

701
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.920
public interest law could be about.

702
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.110
Judge Pregerson understood
the need to act quickly

703
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.440
and Judge Pregerson kept
going back to Caltrans

704
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.320
and saying "You need to do a better job

705
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.250
of addressing the problems of blight."

706
00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:19.923
He continued the injunction
in effect for seven years.

707
00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:26.330
Judge Pregerson clearly
understood that a very robust

708
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:31.510
mitigation plan was going
to be the optimum solution.

709
00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.210
He delivered that message
and that was critical

710
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.570
to getting both the Federal and the State

711
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.910
government to agree to a plan that was

712
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:44.680
going to cost hundreds
of millions of dollars.

713
00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.480
The settlement provided that
roughly half the cost of the

714
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.250
freeway was going to be put
into the mitigation measures.

715
00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.920
Pregerson was more
responsible than anybody

716
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.860
for establishing the
Apprenticeship Program.

717
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.660
You should have certain numbers of women.

718
00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.450
you should have certain
numbers of the minority.

719
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.030
You should try to have as many people

720
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.329
from the impacted area as possible.

721
00:39:09.329 --> 00:39:12.800
That proved to be extremely difficult

722
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.320
because a lot of people
that you would want

723
00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.600
to get those jobs didn't have the skills.

724
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.130
Pregerson said "Well. let's
have an Apprenticeship Program

725
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.070
where we teach these people
the skills from the beginning.

726
00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:27.210
how to hit a hammer into a nail.

727
00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:30.728
then go up from there
and drive the bulldozer."

728
00:39:30.728 --> 00:39:32.400
(bulldozer rumbles)

729
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.430
He had a great concern for minorities.

730
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:37.290
Maybe it was his Jewish background.

731
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:41.150
that he felt he was a minority religiously

732
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.840
and that the Jewish community was one

733
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.550
of many minority groups as he grew up

734
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:50.310
and so he felt concerned
for other minority groups.

735
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.073
I'm not sure where he got that.

736
00:39:53.482 --> 00:39:56.815
(relaxed trumpet music)

737
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.030
- This is a letter from a Congressman.

738
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:09.000
Chuck Holifield of the
19th District in California

739
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
and he writes to my husband
on September 11th. 1945.

740
00:40:14.217 --> 00:40:17.420
"Dear Harry. I rejoice with you

741
00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.600
in the restoration of your Commission.

742
00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.960
The most important thing
in this whole affair

743
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.130
is that you've proven your ability

744
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:28.727
to overcome what seemed to
be a very great tragedy."

745
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.783
Oh. where to begin?

746
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.760
There's no question that my
husband suffered from PTSD.

747
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:47.080
I've known it. Harry has known
it and you could say well.

748
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.180
he certainly suffered in the battlefield.

749
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.920
He had these severe wounds in Okinawa

750
00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:57.470
but by far the greatest
suffering that my husband had

751
00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:00.110
was when he was in Quantico. Virginia

752
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:03.330
in the Officer's Training Facility

753
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:06.403
to become a Second Lieutenant
in the Marine Corps.

754
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:11.300
When Harry and his friend
Mike graduated from the ROTC

755
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.993
program at UCLA. they were
then sent to Quantico.

756
00:41:16.697 --> 00:41:19.100
They were absolutely shocked

757
00:41:20.733 --> 00:41:23.530
by the outrageous racism.

758
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:24.673
bigotry.

759
00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.290
anti-Semitism that would permeate

760
00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:33.013
every aspect of their military life there.

761
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.850
Right after they had taken an exam.

762
00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:40.590
they were called into
the office of an officer

763
00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:45.590
who they considered not very
friendly towards Jews and told

764
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:49.840
that they had been found
to have cheated on the exam

765
00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.707
and of course they denied it
and then the officer said.

766
00:41:52.707 --> 00:41:54.720
"Well then now that you've denied it.

767
00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.007
you're not only a cheat but you're liars."

768
00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:01.500
Just before graduation.
they were called in

769
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:05.463
and told they were going to
be dishonorably discharged.

770
00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:11.953
That was probably the greatest
pain that Harry's ever known.

771
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:17.480
The day that they received
their dishonorable discharges.

772
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.330
Harry decided that he would enlist

773
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:24.373
the very next day in the
Marine Corps as a Private.

774
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.373
He was going into that War.

775
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.380
And then a strange thing happened.

776
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.700
Evidently there were enough people

777
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.790
in high places who said
this is terrible travesty.

778
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.350
what was done to these two boys.

779
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:43.640
Harry was told

780
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.050
that he would get back his commission

781
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.320
and it would be a field commission.

782
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.330
But what happened was he was severely

783
00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:55.653
wounded with these badly mangled legs.

784
00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.603
The doctor came to see
him and he said. "Son.

785
00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.920
one of the requirements is
you're going to have to walk.

786
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.357
You're gonna have to walk."

787
00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:08.690
And so

788
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.180
Harry got up

789
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.433
and he walked.

790
00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.750
He walked about 10 steps

791
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:25.910
and the doctor had a
wheelchair waiting for him and

792
00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.200
he got his commission back

793
00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:36.330
and so. this wound that Harry suffered

794
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.440
was rectified and yet it wasn't.

795
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.610
He never wanted to talk about this.

796
00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:44.860
He didn't tell our children
for years and years

797
00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:48.563
because he felt it was a
stain on his character.

798
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:53.330
One of the things that Harry learned

799
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:58.330
from this experience was that
a little person like Harry

800
00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.680
who was barely out of his
teens when this event happened.

801
00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:07.530
a little person who had no
power and had no network.

802
00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:11.170
no resource. no person who could help him

803
00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:16.170
was totally at the mercy
of whatever powers might be

804
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.440
and so I think Harry learned

805
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:25.030
that one of the things he
needed to do was to get power.

806
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:29.083
to have some voice and
then to start networking.

807
00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.673
I'll never forget his last words.

808
00:44:35.467 --> 00:44:38.370
"I'm so sorry.

809
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:43.370
I regret so much that I can
no longer help anybody."

810
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.920
- I'm gonna bring it home.

811
00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:00.410
When I was eight years
old. my grandfather gave me

812
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:05.410
a stone with the inscription
"Never. never. ever quit."

813
00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:11.499
Being eight. I didn't have
anything yet to quit from.

814
00:45:11.499 --> 00:45:14.110
(audience laughs)

815
00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.457
When I was 10 years old.
he bought me the book

816
00:45:17.457 --> 00:45:20.507
"How to Win Friends and Influence People."

817
00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.120
Win friends?

818
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.150
Influence people?

819
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:29.593
I was just focused on trying
to be like Michael Jordan.

820
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:36.770
As I got older. my grandpa
continued to buy me books.

821
00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.340
Autobiographies of Abraham Lincoln.

822
00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.890
speeches of Winston Churchill

823
00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:45.580
and of course. Strunk's
"Elements of Style."

824
00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:48.840
One summer. we went through
this book cover to cover.

825
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.170
He would call me each Sunday

826
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:54.617
and say without any introduction.

827
00:45:54.617 --> 00:45:56.990
"Turn to page 57."

828
00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:00.310
(audience laughs)

829
00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:03.540
During one weekend session
that I will never forget

830
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:07.170
because it was a particularly
beautiful summer day.

831
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.903
I asked him if we could
skip that day's session.

832
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.290
Grandpa. I said. "It's a beautiful day.

833
00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:18.290
I want to go outside and have
fun with the other kids."

834
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:20.963
He said "Brad. let me tell you something.

835
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.349
Fun is bullshit."

836
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:28.850
(audience laughs)

837
00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:32.370
And I'll never forget
that but it was ironic

838
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:36.110
coming from someone who
loved to make people laugh

839
00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.243
and even at 12 years old. I
knew what he really meant.

840
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:43.080
Don't waste time. work every day

841
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.560
towards bettering yourself
and strive to be better.

842
00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.620
In his later years. I went with him

843
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:53.160
to many dinners and charity
events and at those events.

844
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.240
he would be seated at a
table and a stranger would

845
00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.550
inevitably approach him
and introduce themselves.

846
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:02.633
He would slowly extend his hand.

847
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:06.970
They would shake and suddenly the stranger

848
00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:10.843
was confronted with a Kung Fu
grip they could not escape.

849
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:17.620
The crippling grip continued
as pleasantries were exchanged

850
00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.813
while the stranger pretended
everything was normal.

851
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.040
The handshake would continue an unusually

852
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.880
long period of time where this stranger

853
00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.070
would finally begin to smile or laugh.

854
00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:36.110
I'm sure thinking this crazy old judge

855
00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:39.863
is squeezing the crap out
of my hand and won't let go.

856
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.400
Eventually grandpa would release his grip

857
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:49.400
and a conversation or rather
a history lesson would ensue.

858
00:47:49.517 --> 00:47:54.040
"Where do you live? Near
downtown. near Pershing Square?

859
00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.746
Do you know about General Pershing?"

860
00:47:56.746 --> 00:47:58.080
(audience laughs)

861
00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:01.120
Soon contact information was requested

862
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.900
and then exchanged and then
the stranger unknowingly

863
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.870
had enlisted as a member
of grandpa's army.

864
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:13.840
The truth is that all the
good deeds he was able

865
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:18.800
to accomplish were not the
result of his efforts alone.

866
00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.320
No. there was an army of people who stood

867
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.380
and fought with him
who began as strangers.

868
00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.490
who were brought in with a Kung Fu grip

869
00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:31.983
and soon became lifelong friends.

870
00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:37.210
But grandpa wasn't afraid
to take bold action.

871
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:41.120
inspiring others to join him and they did

872
00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.850
because they knew he was
fighting the good fight.

873
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:49.850
He was a good man and he
would never. never. ever quit.

874
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.315
Thank you.

875
00:48:52.315 --> 00:48:55.315
(audience applauds)

876
00:48:57.376 --> 00:49:00.626
(somber trumpet music)

877
00:49:14.307 --> 00:49:18.690
- [Narrator] In his last days.
Harry knew his work was done.

878
00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:21.693
That it was time for others
to carry on his legacy.

879
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:27.703
His message was we have to
make this world a better place.

880
00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:31.763
We have to leave it in better
shape than when we entered it.

881
00:49:33.277 --> 00:49:37.243
"God puts us here to take care
of each other." he once said.

882
00:49:38.367 --> 00:49:39.763
And I really believe that.

883
00:50:00.056 --> 00:50:03.292
(soft piano music)

884
00:50:03.292 --> 00:50:06.459
(audience applauding)

885
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:14.193
- I grew up in East LA.

886
00:50:15.211 --> 00:50:16.633
It was a wonderful place.

887
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:19.383
In my high school.

888
00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:24.140
the students' parents came from

889
00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.880
over 50 countries

890
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.403
around the world.

891
00:50:32.401 --> 00:50:34.700
You know. we all got along.

892
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.920
We were like brothers and sisters.

893
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.970
People worked together.
they respected each other.

894
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:45.210
I've looked at people
that way. that they're all

895
00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.713
important.

896
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:53.920
That they all have so
much goodness within them.

897
00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:58.033
It's been a great journey
for me. it's not finished.

898
00:51:01.044 --> 00:51:04.044
(audience applauds)

899
00:51:09.997 --> 00:51:12.387
I guess that means I should sit down.

900
00:51:12.387 --> 00:51:13.620
(audience laughs)

901
00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:16.370
But I just want to say this.

902
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:17.463
As a country.

903
00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:21.793
we have a great future.

904
00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:27.063
We have great strength.
we have great resources.

905
00:51:29.146 --> 00:51:30.596
But we need to come together.

906
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:35.920
We need to embrace each
other as brothers and sisters

907
00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:38.590
and we need

908
00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:44.690
to devote so much of our resources

909
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:50.560
to educating our children and
the parents of our children.

910
00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:56.060
Every child that is here
today. every child born here

911
00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:59.200
and every child who is brought here

912
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.430
is a precious asset

913
00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:10.440
and the wealth of our country
is in the minds of our people.

914
00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.573
The other thing I want to say. and I'll

915
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.520
probably get half the people
in this room mad at me but

916
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.030
I feel very good about the future

917
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:27.983
of our country. and you know why?

918
00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:32.574
Because the women are
gonna take over and run it.

919
00:52:32.574 --> 00:52:35.128
(audience applauds)

920
00:52:35.128 --> 00:52:36.295
- Good ending.

921
00:52:41.855 --> 00:52:45.188
(relaxed trumpet music)
