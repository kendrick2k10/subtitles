The coast.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.951
Wow. the ocean!

21
00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:42.244
No one's ever
photographed that before.

22
00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:47.916
That camera is a waste
of all your savings.

23
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:51.128
You're never gonna get in.

24
00:02:51.172 --> 00:02:51.461
Mom and dad know it too.

25
00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.174
They're just too
weak to tell you

26
00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:56.508
that you have no talent.

27
00:02:56.552 --> 00:02:59.887
that they wish you
weren't their problems.

28
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.013

30
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.352
- You're such an idiot.

31
00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:09.271
Go on like that.

32
00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.315

47
00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.334

David extended my
shift tomorrow.

49
00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.379
- Okay. first off.

50
00:04:57.423 --> 00:04:59.172
you have got to stop letting

51
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:05.012
that skeezy. wanna-be
boss walk all over you.

52
00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.596
- He's my actual boss.

53
00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:10.225
- Second. you have like 20
subscribers to your vlog.

54
00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:12.352
I'm sure they'll get over
it if it's delayed a day.

55
00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:14.187
- Mm.

56
00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:18.567
- (titters) Come on.
you're being so sensitive.

57
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.860
- Have a drink. it'll
make you feel better.

58
00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:20.652
- I'm not going. Amy.

59
00:05:20.696 --> 00:05:22.738
- It'll be fun. I promise.

60
00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:25.032
- Why don't you invite Lindsey?

61
00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.575
- Because Lindsey is a mess.

62
00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:28.660
and I wanna have a good
time. not play babysitter.

63
00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:32.039
Besides if you go with me.

64
00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:33.665
it'll make Derek jealous.

65
00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:37.919
- Why would I wanna make
my boyfriend jealous?

66
00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:40.464
- Oh. Tara. Tara. Tara.

67
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.175
You have so much to learn
about the ways of men.

68
00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.469
(glasses clink)

69
00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.971
- Okay.

70
00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:49.222
- Rude!

71
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.141
You are so stubborn!

72
00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:52.184

73
00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:55.103
- Just like make an appearance.

74
00:05:55.147 --> 00:05:58.607
You can bring your camera.
take photos of rich kids

75
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.234
making bad choices in
their natural habitat.

76
00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:02.986
- Mm. that sounds appealing.

77
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.738
- Honestly. they would
probably pay you big bucks

78
00:06:04.782 --> 00:06:07.574
for some profesh insta photos.

79
00:06:07.618 --> 00:06:08.909
Gotta make your money somehow.

80
00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.119
those gourmet meals
don't grow on trees.

81
00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:15.082
- I am trying to make money
by working on my vlog.

82
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:18.043
- Okay. I will pay
you however much

83
00:06:18.087 --> 00:06:20.837
you're gonna make from these
reviews if you come with me.

84
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:23.131
- (scoffs) I'm not
your charity case. Amy.

85
00:06:23.175 --> 00:06:26.218
- Oh my god. why would you
think that I think that?

86
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.304
I just wanna have a fun
time with my best gal.

87
00:06:29.348 --> 00:06:31.515
And if I can help you

You're welcome.

91
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:42.818
I made it from scratch.

92
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.070
- You're the worst.
- I know.

93
00:06:45.114 --> 00:06:46.238

111
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.458

112
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.961

You got it.

113
00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:45.464

114
00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:46.840
- Where's my phone.

115
00:07:46.884 --> 00:07:48.717
- You don't need it right now.

116
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.634
- I need to call a car.

117
00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.178

118
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.929

Next message.

- [Derek On Voicemail] Hey. I
know you're at work right now

139
00:09:40.706 --> 00:09:42.622
and there's no need
to call me back.

140
00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:42.706
I...

141
00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:48.545
Well. I guess I'm
just gonna say it.

142
00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:50.463
I feel like maybe we
should take a break.

143
00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.465
The big show is coming up.

144
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.051
and I just really
need to focus on that.

145
00:09:56.972 --> 00:09:58.555
You've always been my
biggest cheerleader

146
00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:02.475
and I appreciate all that.
but I just think that...

147
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:07.147
I don't think I can be
the same to you right now.

148
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.482
You know. I'm under a lot
of pressure with everything

149
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:10.984
and I just think
it's for the best.

150
00:10:11.028 --> 00:10:13.528
So yeah...

151
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:18.450
Well. I hope we can
still be friends.

152
00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.910
and if you wanna still come
to the show and take pictures.

153
00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:21.870
that would be awesome.

154
00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:24.331
But I understand if not.

155
00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:26.791
Anyway...

156
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.961

You're too good for him.

169
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:28.395
- Am I?

170
00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:29.521
- He's a wannabe rockstar

171

that still thinks he
can make it at 35.

172

Trust me when I say
you can do better.

173

I'm doing anymore. Amy.

I hate my job.

non-existent career.

My parents don't talk
to me. and my boyfriend.

who apparently was a
total loser anyway.

178
00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:53.503
just dumped me.

179
00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:56.256
- That's what I'm saying.

180
00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:57.757
You're stuck.

181
00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.801
You're dead in the water.

182
00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:02.470
but this is your chance
to change all of that.

183
00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:05.181
Nobody wants to be
a waitress forever.

184
00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:06.433
You're almost 30.
can you imagine

185
00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.018
if you were still slinging
French fries then?

186
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.354
- I'm not you. Amy.

187
00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:13.231
I don't have any savings.

188
00:12:13.275 --> 00:12:15.900
I'm living on credit cards.

189
00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:18.862
- I'm talking about getting
creative with your talents.

190
00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:22.615
- No.

191
00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:25.660
You're not gonna drag
me out to any more clubs

192
00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:28.163
where I take photos of
your other spoiled friends.

193
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:30.081
- Okay.

194
00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:32.542
I know you're having a bad day.

195
00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:34.252
so I'm gonna pretend
like I didn't hear that.

196
00:12:34.296 --> 00:12:37.380
- Well. I didn't mean--
- No. no. no. it's okay.

197
00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:39.174
Listen.

198
00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:41.718
I have an idea.

199
00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:45.180
My parents have
this amazing house

200
00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:47.432
that I used to go to
every summer as a kid.

201
00:12:47.476 --> 00:12:49.392
It's on it's own private lake.

202
00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:50.477
It's surrounded by forest.

203
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.895
Great for hiking.
totally secluded.

204
00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.314
It's just like.

205
00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:56.858
honestly. it's really amazing.

206
00:12:56.902 --> 00:12:58.193
- Okay.

207
00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:01.237
- Well. my mom mentioned
that they're selling it

208
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.866
and so we should totally
go while we still can.

209
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.076
You can bring your
camera and take photos.

210
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.078
I bet my parents would
pay you for that.

211
00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.372
And honestly. the
place is so beautiful

212
00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:12.957
that you're gonna
wanna do that anyway.

213
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.083
(Tara sighs)

214
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.001
Don't give me that.

215
00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:17.170
This is not some charity case

216
00:13:17.214 --> 00:13:20.590
or whatever hateful
thing you said.

217
00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.884
I just think it'd be
a great opportunity

218
00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:25.011
to kill two birds
with one stone.

219
00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:27.514
- And what birds would those be?

220
00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:30.767
- Well. in addition to
a possible paycheck.

221
00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:33.061
we could have a girls' weekend!

222
00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:36.481
No work. no douchy Derek.

223
00:13:36.525 --> 00:13:40.777
just a beautiful
lake and great views.

224
00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.946
Let's do it. let's
go this weekend.

225
00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:45.323
- I'm not big on lakes.

226
00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:45.990
- Who's not big on lakes?

227
00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.161
Is this about your brother?

228
00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:52.163
- Why would you say that?

229
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.960
- Tara. I know you
better than anybody else.

230
00:13:57.003 --> 00:14:01.089
And you're never gonna
be able to move forward

231
00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:03.132
until you let go of your past.

232
00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:05.510
It was an accident.

233
00:14:05.554 --> 00:14:06.302
It was a...

234
00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:11.182
A horrible accident.
but an accident.

235
00:14:12.978 --> 00:14:14.269
- It's not that.
- Then what?

236
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.484
- Derek chose this weekend.

237
00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:25.113
- Tara. you can't go to that.
- What?

238
00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:28.032
- (sighs) I think
he wants me to go.

239
00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:30.994
Look. I know he wants me to go.

240
00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:34.080
If I could just talk to him--

241
00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.666
- And say what?

242
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.501
Hey. congrats on the show.

243
00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:41.212
I'll be in the back taking
photos of your band for free.

244
00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:43.798
Oh. and by the way. I'm
still totally available

245
00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:45.800
for any emotional abuse
you'd like to fling

246
00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:47.427
in my general direction.

247
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.679
This does not have
a happy ending.

248
00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:50.972
Trust me.

249
00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:53.099
He just wants you
there for the photos.

250
00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:55.018
And I'm saying this
because I love you

251
00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.020
and you're my friend.

252
00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.983
- I just feel like...

253
00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:04.986
Like I need to be there.

254
00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:06.988
- Okay.

255
00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:08.948
How about this?

256
00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:13.077
We go for a day. for 24
hours. see how it goes.

257
00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:14.078
If you still feel like
you need to go to the show

258
00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.246
then. okay. fine.

259
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.082
we'll just leave first
thing in the morning.

260
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.500
and we can make it in time.

261
00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:23.087
But if you have fun. we
can stay the weekend.

262
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.298
And you can bring your work.

263
00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:28.509
I mean. it would be a gorgeous
backdrop for those vlogs.

264
00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:29.135
And I know my parents
are gonna wanna pay you

265
00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.137
for those photos.

266
00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:34.223
It'll be great.

267
00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:35.600
It'll be a killer weekend.

268
00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:37.477
What do you say?

269
00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:39.187
Deal?

270
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:50.031
(mysterious music)

271
00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:53.701
(birds chirping)

272
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:02.585
- [Tara Voiceover]
Hey guys. Tara here.

273
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:04.295
Thought I would put these
new lenses to the test

274
00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:07.131
by going on a little nature
getaway to my friend's lake.

275
00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.717
I know. I was surprised when
I heard they had a lake too.

276
00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:12.303
And get this. it's
named after them.

277
00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:14.138
Anyway. I'll be posting
updates once we're there.

278
00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.557
so make sure you check back.

279
00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:20.603
- [Tara] You weren't kidding.

280
00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.897
this really is the
middle of nowhere.

281
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.774
- [Amy] Does your car
always make that sound?

282
00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:28.778
(car rattling)

283
00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.280
- [Tara] This is the
little lake house?

284
00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:32.198
- [Amy] This is it.

285
00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:47.672
(car hissing)

286
00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:56.806
- Is it okay?

287
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.682
- Yeah. this happens.

288
00:16:57.726 --> 00:16:59.308
It's probably just overheated.

289
00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.102
I think I'll take a look at
it when it's cooled down.

290
00:17:01.146 --> 00:17:02.145
- Okay.

291
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.270
So...

292
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.899
What do you think?

293
00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.985
- I think when you
said lake house

294
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:10.236
I wasn't expecting this.
(Amy giggles)

295
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.740
Also. why has it taken
us this long to visit?

296
00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.116
- I may have forgotten
that we owned it

297
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.326
until my mum mentioned
we were selling it.

298
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.120
Wait till you see
the view of the lake.

299
00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:25.418
(Amy sighs)

300
00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.178
- (exhales) Wow.

301
00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:35.261
- Right?

302
00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:37.680
(Amy exhales)

303
00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:40.475
(calm music)

304
00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:48.191
I remember it being bigger.

305
00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:53.529
- [Tara Voiceover] John!

306
00:17:58.203 --> 00:17:58.868
- Are you okay?

307
00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.036
- Yeah.

308
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.497
I didn't realize we'd
be right on the coast.

309
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.498
- We're not.

310
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:04.290
There's a whole lake in between.

311
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:09.378
(Amy titters)

312
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.756
- When's the last
time someone was here?

313
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.299
- Who knows!

314
00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.093
My parents rent it out
every now and again.

315
00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:18.471
but honestly I think it just
sits empty most of the time.

316
00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.264
- You'd think they'd wanna
be here all the time?

317
00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:22.475
- Oh. you haven't seen
their actual house.

318
00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.435
This is a dump compared to that.

319
00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:26.687
- Does this thing work?

320
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.815
- Probably not. this
place is a catch all

321
00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:31.275
for decades of
strange collectibles.

322
00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:36.280
(Amy sighs)

323
00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.324
- No service.
- Right?

324
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.493
It'll be good.

325
00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:41.410
No temptation.

326
00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:43.788
- Is there wifi at least?

327
00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:47.041
- I think so.

328
00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:48.042
- Amy!
- What?

329
00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:49.252
- How am I supposed
to do my vlog?

330
00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.629
- Ah. stop whining
about your vlog!

331
00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:54.423
Just record your videos here

332
00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.175
and upload them
when you get back.

333
00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:59.220
Could I get a thank you. Amy?

334
00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:00.638
I'm doing this for you.

335
00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:04.725
- You're right.

336
00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:05.309
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:07.854
Thank you.

338
00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:10.314
This is really something.

339
00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:14.110
- You're welcome.

340
00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:14.277
Let's go see your room.

341
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.951
I hope you like pink.

342
00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:23.286
You know mom loves
an accent pillow.

343
00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:26.289
- Is that supposed to be open?

344
00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:32.545
- God. whoever rented it last
must have left it. idiots.

345
00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:33.963
I hope there's not water damage.

346
00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:35.756
I don't want my parents
thinking it was us.

347
00:19:44.475 --> 00:19:45.308
You're being weird.

348
00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:49.437
Wine.

349
00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:02.533
(wind whooshing)

350
00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:07.496
(birds chirping)

351
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:13.419
(water flowing)

352
00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:22.261
(birds chirping)

353
00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:24.889
(poignant music)

354
00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:52.208
(door creaking)

355
00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:54.752
- Amy?

356
00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:11.352
(calm music)

357
00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:14.188
(food sizzling)

358
00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:21.487
Stop that.

359
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.995
♪ I fight. still I call ♪

360
00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:31.205
- It is a shame you're
never in your own photos.

361
00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:33.291
- Yeah. I prefer it that way.

362
00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:36.627
(phone beeps)
- Oh. my phone's dying.

363
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:37.670
Do you have your charger?

364
00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:38.546
- Where's yours.

365
00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:42.049
- Mm. I might've forgotten it.

366
00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:42.967
But that's what I have you for.

367
00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:45.011
It's just for the music anyway.

368
00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:45.886
- By the computer.

369
00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:50.391
- Ah-hah!

370
00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:55.396
See. this one is fun.

371
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.690
Don't you wanna skip
stupid Derek's stupid show

372
00:21:57.734 --> 00:22:00.192
and stay here all
weekend with me?

373
00:22:02.697 --> 00:22:07.325
Tara. when are you gonna
realize that he's a jerk

374
00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:08.951
and he is never gonna change

375
00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:09.577
and that you need to move on?

376
00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:12.830
- I care about him. Amy.

377
00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:14.790
I just think

378
00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:17.126
it's not a bad thing to be there

379
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.170
for people you care about.

380
00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:20.588
- And I commend you

381
00:22:20.631 --> 00:22:21.922
for always seeing
the best in people.

382
00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:26.135
really. I do. even when
it is very hard to find.

383
00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:29.680
But you have got to
stop letting people

384
00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:30.598
take advantage of you.

385
00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:34.101
- That's easy for you to say.

386
00:22:34.145 --> 00:22:35.603
You could have any guy you want.

387
00:22:35.646 --> 00:22:37.772
- Girl. have you
seen these photos?!

388
00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:39.148
So could you.

389
00:22:40.777 --> 00:22:41.609
Okay. subject change.

390
00:22:41.652 --> 00:22:43.819
Guess who has a new book project

391
00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:47.406
that obviously needs to be
the center of my universe?

392
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.200
- Oo. what does mommy dearest

393
00:22:49.243 --> 00:22:50.659
have us working on this time?

394
00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:52.328
- Who knows.

395
00:22:52.372 --> 00:22:53.412
- Plates.

396
00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:57.375
- Heaven forbid I have
a life outside of her.

397
00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:00.544
I wish my parents
were more like yours.

398
00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:02.088
- You mean totally absent?

399
00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:04.131
- Well. that's not fair.

400
00:23:04.175 --> 00:23:06.384
Their absence isn't
entirely their fault.

401
00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:09.929
I mean. I've seen you ignore
your mom's phone calls.

402
00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:13.516
- You don't know--
(door bangs)

403
00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:15.893
(mysterious music)

404
00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:16.519
- What was that?

405
00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:26.153
- Looks like my door.

406
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.290
- It's a draft.

407
00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:38.833
I thought I told
you to close it.

408
00:23:38.876 --> 00:23:42.253
(birds chirping)

409
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:45.548
- I thought I did.

410
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:48.509
- Well. obviously
not all the way.

411
00:23:48.553 --> 00:23:50.469
Just remember to
lock it this time.

412
00:24:05.653 --> 00:24:08.195
(water gushing)

413
00:24:15.746 --> 00:24:16.579
- Tara!

414
00:24:18.708 --> 00:24:21.083
(Tara panting)

415
00:24:53.493 --> 00:24:55.576
(tense music)

416
00:25:28.277 --> 00:25:30.945
(Tara gasps)

417
00:25:30.988 --> 00:25:33.697
(Tara panting)

418
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.375
- Are you awake?

419
00:25:47.004 --> 00:25:48.754
- Come up.

420
00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:07.106
(birds chirping)

421
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:10.109
(mysterious music)

422
00:26:17.201 --> 00:26:18.993
- Hey guys. Tara here.

423
00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:21.203
As promised. the
view from the porch.

424
00:26:21.247 --> 00:26:22.913
There are worst
places to work. right?

425
00:26:22.957 --> 00:26:24.081
I'm about to head
down to the lake.

426
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:24.873
and I'm gonna to try
to convince my friend

427
00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:26.041
to do some modeling for me

428
00:26:26.085 --> 00:26:28.085
so we can test out the
new portraiture lens.

429
00:26:28.129 --> 00:26:30.296
- You ready to head down?

430
00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:32.756
- Shouldn't take
much convincing.

431
00:26:34.427 --> 00:26:36.802
(waves lapping)

432
00:26:36.846 --> 00:26:38.637
- Okay. try one
looking up at the sky.

433
00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:42.641
Okay. try away

434
00:26:42.685 --> 00:26:45.561
just so we can see the back
of your hat for a second.

435
00:26:47.315 --> 00:26:49.440
Oh. these are
actually pretty great.

436
00:26:49.483 --> 00:26:51.150
- You sound surprised.

437
00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:52.943
Don't forget who was
crowned Little Miss Bedford.

438
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:54.653
Still got it.

439
00:26:54.697 --> 00:26:55.821
- When was that?

440
00:26:55.865 --> 00:26:56.989
- I was eight.

441
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.034
- Yeah. maybe it's just
a really great lens.

442
00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:01.702
- Rude!

443
00:27:01.746 --> 00:27:02.536
Okay. put it away.

444
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.912
Let's go swim.
- I'm good.

445
00:27:04.415 --> 00:27:04.455
- Please.

446
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.086
Please.

447
00:27:12.632 --> 00:27:13.756
(both giggle)

448
00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:15.299
- I'm enjoying the sun.

449
00:27:15.343 --> 00:27:17.676
- (sighs) I don't
wanna swim alone.

450
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.260
Besides it'll be good for you.

451
00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:21.597
- Good for me.

452
00:27:21.724 --> 00:27:23.474
Am I missing something here?

453
00:27:23.517 --> 00:27:27.061
It's new chapter. come
to face your fears.

454
00:27:29.065 --> 00:27:29.104
- What are...

455
00:27:30.733 --> 00:27:32.566
Oh my. this is about John.

456
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.275
- I don't know what
you're talking you about.

457
00:27:33.319 --> 00:27:34.151
- Yeah. you do.

458
00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:38.656
You even asked me before

459
00:27:38.699 --> 00:27:40.366
if I didn't wanna
come because of him.

460
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:42.201
- If I did. I don't remember it.

461
00:27:43.454 --> 00:27:46.330
Babe. this is not about
you and your brother.

462
00:27:46.374 --> 00:27:48.207
This is about me trying
to get you to loosen up

463
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.000
and have a good time.

464
00:27:50.044 --> 00:27:52.044
Everything with you is so heavy.

465
00:27:52.338 --> 00:27:54.213
- He died Amy.

466
00:27:55.466 --> 00:27:57.007
- 10 years ago.

467
00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:01.720
You can't keep using
him as an excuse--

468
00:28:01.764 --> 00:28:03.138
- Using him as an excuse?!

469
00:28:03.182 --> 00:28:04.890
- You know what I mean?

470
00:28:04.934 --> 00:28:05.307
- You know. I don't think I do.

471
00:28:06.936 --> 00:28:10.938
You have no idea what
it's like to lose someone.

472
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:13.524
to feel responsible.

473
00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:15.943
to have your own mother
and father resent you

474
00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:16.652
for being the one who survived.

475
00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:18.153
- They don't resent you.

476
00:28:18.197 --> 00:28:20.364
- You have no idea. Amy.

477
00:28:20.408 --> 00:28:22.324
You think you have this great
understanding of my life.

478
00:28:23.244 --> 00:28:26.412
You don't have a clue!

479
00:28:26.455 --> 00:28:28.247
Worry about your own problems.

480
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.581
You're always complaining

481
00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:31.834
that your mom is so
controlling and so demanding.

482
00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:32.751
Leave!

483
00:28:33.921 --> 00:28:35.754
Oh. but who's gonna
pay for all this.

484
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:37.172
- That's really not fair.

485
00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:39.216
- Life isn't fair.

486
00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.884
And the sooner you stop trying
to convince me otherwise.

487
00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:42.302
the better.

488
00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:52.896
- Hey.

489
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.232
I'm sorry

490
00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:59.236
It's just I see you
constantly punishing yourself.

491
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.988
and honestly it breaks my heart.

492
00:29:02.366 --> 00:29:03.657
Like with guys like Derek.

493
00:29:04.827 --> 00:29:06.034
I think you stick around

494
00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:07.828
because you don't think
you deserve better.

495
00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:09.955
You do.

496
00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:15.419
(bird cawing)
(waves lapping)

497
00:29:15.463 --> 00:29:17.880
- (sighs) I have an idea.

498
00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:18.756
- Yeah?

499
00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:22.551
- How about we don't
talk about guys anymore?

500
00:29:23.637 --> 00:29:26.722
Let's just focus on you and
me for the rest of the trip.

501
00:29:26.766 --> 00:29:28.182
How does that sound?

502
00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:31.894
- (gasps) Does that
mean you are staying?

503
00:29:31.937 --> 00:29:33.312
- I didn't say that.

504
00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:36.231
No. I'm still debating.

505
00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:40.778
- Woo-hoo!
(Tara groans)

506
00:29:48.496 --> 00:29:49.369
- I was thinking
about what you said.

507
00:29:50.414 --> 00:29:52.289
- What did I say?

508
00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:54.541
- That I complain
about my parents

509
00:29:54.585 --> 00:29:57.377
but have no problem
letting them support me.

510
00:29:58.798 --> 00:30:00.005
- I'm sorry. I was upset--

511
00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:03.467
- No. no. you're right.

512
00:30:03.511 --> 00:30:04.885
I am totally dependent on them.

513
00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:09.431
Which is why. I guess.
I'm so envious of you.

514
00:30:09.475 --> 00:30:10.599
- Envious of me?

515
00:30:10.643 --> 00:30:11.767
- Yeah!

516
00:30:11.811 --> 00:30:14.019
I mean. I have no idea
what it would be like

517
00:30:14.063 --> 00:30:17.981
to have no one expect
anything of me. you know.

518
00:30:18.025 --> 00:30:18.857
to have that kind of freedom.

519
00:30:18.943 --> 00:30:22.027
(birds chirping)

520
00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:31.370
- Hey. sorry.
(Tara gasps)

521
00:30:31.413 --> 00:30:33.497
I didn't mean to scare you.

522
00:30:36.043 --> 00:30:37.835
- Can we help you?

523
00:30:37.878 --> 00:30:38.252
- No. well maybe.

524
00:30:39.713 --> 00:30:41.463
I was down by the lake when
I saw you two across the way.

525
00:30:41.507 --> 00:30:44.007
but you left before
I could say hi.

526
00:30:45.052 --> 00:30:46.510
- And what are you
doing out here?

527
00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:49.471
- Well. I guess you could
say I'm Cheryl Strayeding it.

528
00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:55.018
- I'm sorry. what?

529
00:30:55.104 --> 00:30:57.312
- It's Cheryl Strayed.

530
00:30:57.356 --> 00:30:57.896
"Wild?"

531
00:30:59.775 --> 00:31:01.775
It's one of my favorite books.
I did a whole vlog about it.

532
00:31:01.819 --> 00:31:02.609
- Oh.

533
00:31:03.362 --> 00:31:05.445
- Well. Cheryl.

534
00:31:05.489 --> 00:31:08.031
- (chuckles) It's
Lucas. actually.

535
00:31:09.368 --> 00:31:10.701
Look. I don't wanna
bother you two.

536
00:31:10.744 --> 00:31:12.119
I was just wondering if
maybe you knew of a place

537
00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:14.037
where I could charge
my phone for a bit?

538
00:31:14.582 --> 00:31:17.666
- Did Cheryl Strayed
have a phone?

539
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.042
- I don't think so.

540
00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:20.335
but she's way tougher than me.

541
00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:22.963
(Tara chuckles)

542
00:31:23.007 --> 00:31:24.882
(Amy giggles)

543
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:27.551
- As a matter of fact. we have
a place right off the trail.

544
00:31:27.595 --> 00:31:29.887
But you know. there's no
service out here. right?

545
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.597
- Yeah. I figured as much.

546
00:31:32.725 --> 00:31:33.849
Still it wouldn't hurt
to have some juice

547
00:31:33.893 --> 00:31:36.768
in case I eventually
come across some bars.

548
00:31:38.397 --> 00:31:40.147
- Sure.

549
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.689
I'm Amy.

550
00:31:40.733 --> 00:31:41.315
This is Tara.

551
00:31:42.568 --> 00:31:43.317
Follow us.

552
00:32:03.923 --> 00:32:04.755
- Wow.

553
00:32:04.798 --> 00:32:06.173
- That's what I said too.

554
00:32:06.216 --> 00:32:07.966
- It's in massive
need of an update.

555
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.301
but it does the trick.

556
00:32:09.345 --> 00:32:11.136
- And it's just the
two of you here?

557
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.305
- Why do you ask?

558
00:32:13.349 --> 00:32:15.474
- Just seems a little dangerous.

559
00:32:15.517 --> 00:32:17.309
Two attractive young ladies

560
00:32:17.353 --> 00:32:19.227
alone in a big old
house like this.

561
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:21.521
I feel like I've seen
this movie before.

562
00:32:21.565 --> 00:32:24.024
- (titters) That's funny.

563
00:32:24.068 --> 00:32:27.194
You're funny.

564
00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:29.071
So do you have a charger
or do you need one?

565
00:32:29.198 --> 00:32:30.030
- Oh. no. I'm good.

566
00:32:30.074 --> 00:32:31.114
- Fabulous.

567
00:32:31.158 --> 00:32:32.449
Charge away!

568
00:32:34.161 --> 00:32:35.577
I'm gonna go grab a shower.

569
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:36.870
Do you mind?

570
00:32:36.914 --> 00:32:38.747
He's totally the
perfect rebound.

571
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:39.998
Go for it.

572
00:32:40.042 --> 00:32:41.750
You kids have fun.

573
00:32:41.794 --> 00:32:44.002
- If I miss you. thank
you for the hospitality.

574
00:32:44.046 --> 00:32:46.797
I should be out of
here in like 10.

575
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.132
- No. no. no. no. no.
make yourself at home.

576
00:32:49.176 --> 00:32:51.009
I'll be right back down.

577
00:32:51.053 --> 00:32:53.929
(mysterious music)

578
00:32:54.306 --> 00:32:57.808
(Lucas exhales)

579
00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:03.188
- So you just out here doing
some soul searching. huh?

580
00:33:03.232 --> 00:33:05.774
- Yeah. yeah.
something like that.

581
00:33:07.486 --> 00:33:08.777
I noticed your camera

582
00:33:08.821 --> 00:33:10.445
and some pretty serious
equipment you got there.

583
00:33:14.201 --> 00:33:17.077
- Yeah. well I'm far from a
pretty serious photographer.

584
00:33:18.622 --> 00:33:19.830
- I dabble a bit myself.

585
00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:25.002
Though. I would have no idea
how to make a career out of it.

586
00:33:25.045 --> 00:33:25.836
- That makes two of us.

587
00:33:25.879 --> 00:33:27.337
- What's that?

588
00:33:27.381 --> 00:33:30.173
- It's a work in progress.

589
00:33:30.217 --> 00:33:32.384
Let's just leave it at that.

590
00:33:33.512 --> 00:33:35.220
- Aren't we all just
works in progress?

591
00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:54.239
- To our new friend

592
00:33:54.283 --> 00:33:56.158
on the beginning of
his hero's journey.

593
00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:59.244
and to my bestest friend

594
00:33:59.288 --> 00:34:01.455
on the beginning
of her new chapter.

595
00:34:02.583 --> 00:34:05.417
(glasses clinking)

596
00:34:06.962 --> 00:34:08.086
- So I'm gathering
that the two of you

597
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.172
have known each other
for a very long time.

598
00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:11.381
- Oh. a long time.

599
00:34:11.425 --> 00:34:13.341
- Why do you say it like that?

600
00:34:13.385 --> 00:34:14.676
Like it's a bad thing?

601
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.261
- I didn't. I just
think it's kind of scary

602
00:34:16.305 --> 00:34:18.180
when you think about

603
00:34:18.223 --> 00:34:19.890
how long we've actually
known each other.

604
00:34:19.933 --> 00:34:22.434
Amy was my first friend when
my family moved to town.

605
00:34:22.478 --> 00:34:24.227
- And nemesis.

606
00:34:24.271 --> 00:34:25.437
- It's a little
bit of a stretch.

607
00:34:25.481 --> 00:34:26.772
- Are you kidding me?

608
00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:28.440
We were famous for that fight.

609
00:34:28.484 --> 00:34:29.941
- Fight?
- Mm-hmm.

610
00:34:29.985 --> 00:34:31.109
That's how we met.

611
00:34:31.195 --> 00:34:32.194
I was dragged to
this fraternity.

612
00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:34.279
- Oh. the robe.

613
00:34:34.323 --> 00:34:35.822
- And someone was
holding up the bathroom.

614
00:34:35.866 --> 00:34:37.199
- I was having a moment.

615
00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:38.033
- So I started
banging on the door.

616
00:34:38.077 --> 00:34:39.534
- In this totally rude way.

617
00:34:39.578 --> 00:34:42.370
- And Amy. let me know just
how rude she thought I was.

618
00:34:42.414 --> 00:34:45.874
- And Tara called
me a hypocrite.

619
00:34:45.918 --> 00:34:48.418
- There was copious amounts
of cheap liquor involved.

620
00:34:48.462 --> 00:34:50.879
so things really went
downhill from there.

621
00:34:50.923 --> 00:34:53.715
- I think there's still
a video of it somewhere.

622
00:34:53.759 --> 00:34:54.424
- We've come a long
way since then.

623
00:34:54.468 --> 00:34:56.343
- Oh. like fine wines.

624
00:34:56.386 --> 00:34:59.596
- I was in this new place.
I didn't know anyone.

625
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.266
And then this girl that I
get in a massive fight with

626
00:35:03.393 --> 00:35:04.851
in front of everyone.

627
00:35:04.895 --> 00:35:05.560
somehow ends up
giving me a ride home.

628
00:35:05.604 --> 00:35:07.020
- With my driver.

629
00:35:07.064 --> 00:35:08.522
- And by the end of the ride.

630
00:35:08.565 --> 00:35:11.900
I'm confiding in her and
I'm crying with her. and...

631
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.447
You were really there
for me that year.

632
00:35:17.491 --> 00:35:18.323
I don't know what I
would've done without you.

633
00:35:18.367 --> 00:35:21.993
(poignant music)

634
00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:26.164
- Freshman year can be tough.

635
00:35:29.628 --> 00:35:32.379
- Yeah. it wasn't really
that. it was my brother.

636
00:35:33.507 --> 00:35:36.341
Sorry. I don't really
talk about it often.

637
00:35:36.385 --> 00:35:39.136
but we lost my brother that year

638
00:35:39.179 --> 00:35:41.304
and it just kind of
ripped my family apart.

639
00:35:44.017 --> 00:35:45.267
We moved because...

640
00:35:47.104 --> 00:35:49.437
I don't know because my mom
thought it would be better

641
00:35:49.481 --> 00:35:50.438
to start fresh somewhere else.

642
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.316
But we didn't
really start fresh.

643
00:35:54.862 --> 00:35:56.194
There was nothing to start.

644
00:35:58.073 --> 00:36:00.699
It was actually
more like the end.

645
00:36:02.536 --> 00:36:03.326
- I'm sorry.

646
00:36:04.872 --> 00:36:06.746
- It was a long time ago.

647
00:36:08.292 --> 00:36:11.626
I moved out on my own and
Amy became my new family.

648
00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:14.296
I don't really talk
to my parents anymore.

649
00:36:16.508 --> 00:36:18.633
I think they just
couldn't look at me

650
00:36:18.677 --> 00:36:20.635
without being overwhelmed

651
00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:22.429
at how much they
miss my brother. so.

652
00:36:29.897 --> 00:36:31.479
Anyway. here we are.

653
00:36:31.523 --> 00:36:34.274
Sorry. I didn't mean to--
- No. it's...

654
00:36:36.153 --> 00:36:37.360
I know what it's like
to lose someone you love

655
00:36:39.615 --> 00:36:41.198
even if it was a long time ago

656
00:36:41.241 --> 00:36:43.617
when everyone keeps telling
you it's time to move on.

657
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.285
- It was 10 years ago.

658
00:36:45.329 --> 00:36:46.578
- Amy!

659
00:36:46.622 --> 00:36:50.457
- I mean. don't you think
she should reach out?

660
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.542
- I don't think--
- It's time.

661
00:36:52.586 --> 00:36:56.213
- I think Tara could
probably decide for herself.

662
00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:06.473
- So Lucas. what do you do?

663
00:37:08.435 --> 00:37:10.060
- I'm a pharmacist actually.

664
00:37:10.103 --> 00:37:11.269
- Oh!
- Yeah.

665
00:37:11.313 --> 00:37:13.313
Well. I used to be.

666
00:37:13.357 --> 00:37:14.898
- Used to be?

667
00:37:14.942 --> 00:37:16.816
- Yeah. I don't know. I just.

668
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.319
I recently had a
change of heart.

669
00:37:19.363 --> 00:37:21.571
I got into it because I
wanted to help people.

670
00:37:21.615 --> 00:37:24.908
and lately it just feels
like I'm serving big pharma.

671
00:37:24.952 --> 00:37:27.035
So I got out.

672
00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:29.079
- So you're just out here
in the middle of nowhere.

673
00:37:29.122 --> 00:37:31.706
Looking for what?

674
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.333
- (chuckles) I guess I'll
know it when I see it.

675
00:37:35.462 --> 00:37:36.670
What about you two?

676
00:37:36.713 --> 00:37:39.881
I know you're a
photographer. Tara.

677
00:37:39.925 --> 00:37:41.341
- Yeah. well. she could be

678
00:37:41.385 --> 00:37:43.468
if she'd ever get rid of that
embarrassing waitress job.

679
00:37:43.512 --> 00:37:45.303
- Thanks. Amy.

680
00:37:45.347 --> 00:37:47.264
- No. that's not what I mean.

681
00:37:47.307 --> 00:37:49.766
It's just you have
so much talent

682
00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:53.645
and you are wasting it at
that dumpy tourist trap.

683
00:37:53.689 --> 00:37:55.355
You could be making
so much more money

684
00:37:55.399 --> 00:37:58.108
than minimum wage and bad tips.

685
00:37:58.151 --> 00:37:59.859
And then maybe you
could afford a car

686
00:37:59.903 --> 00:38:01.069
that doesn't sound
like a death rattle.

687
00:38:01.113 --> 00:38:02.862
- You got car trouble?
- No. it's fine.

688
00:38:02.906 --> 00:38:04.322
- I could take a
look if you'd like.

689
00:38:04.366 --> 00:38:05.490
- Would you. please?

690
00:38:05.534 --> 00:38:07.742
I feel like I am risking my life

691
00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:09.577
every time I get
into that thing.

692
00:38:09.621 --> 00:38:10.829
- It's fine.
- I got tools in my car.

693
00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:13.540
It's not a big deal.
- Wait. you have a car.

694
00:38:13.583 --> 00:38:15.625
I thought you were
eat. pray. loving this.

695
00:38:15.669 --> 00:38:16.751
- (chuckles) I am.

696
00:38:16.795 --> 00:38:18.211
I'm just starting.

697
00:38:18.255 --> 00:38:20.588
It's not too far from the lake.

698
00:38:20.632 --> 00:38:23.341
- Well. maybe when Amy's done
roasting me. we can go get it.

699
00:38:23.385 --> 00:38:25.844
- I'm not roasting you.

700
00:38:25.887 --> 00:38:26.928
God. she's so sensitive.

701
00:38:26.972 --> 00:38:28.013
I'm just being honest.

702
00:38:28.056 --> 00:38:30.682
You have so much
potential. you know.

703
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.810
- What about you. Amy?

704
00:38:34.688 --> 00:38:35.437
What do you do?

705
00:38:40.277 --> 00:38:41.609
I work with my parents actually.

706
00:38:47.117 --> 00:38:48.950
You seem like a really nice guy.

707
00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:50.577
and ordinarily I would invite
you to stay the weekend.

708
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:55.206
but unfortunately
Tara's boyfriend

709
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.249
is playing a show.
- Amy!

710
00:38:56.293 --> 00:38:57.167
- So we have to
get back for that.

711
00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.919
So.
- He's not my boyfriend.

712
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:02.964
He dumped me this week actually.

713
00:39:03.008 --> 00:39:04.466
- Oh. they've been
on and off for years.

714
00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:05.508
- Lucky guy.

715
00:39:05.552 --> 00:39:06.885
- Well this time we're off.

716
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:08.511
For good.

717
00:39:11.683 --> 00:39:12.974
I'm not going to the show.

718
00:39:15.437 --> 00:39:15.935
- You're not?

719
00:39:15.979 --> 00:39:17.187
- No. I'm not.

720
00:39:21.068 --> 00:39:22.817
We're gonna be staying here
for the rest of the weekend.

721
00:39:22.861 --> 00:39:26.321
And you're welcome to stay with
us for as long as you like.

722
00:39:26.365 --> 00:39:27.113
Right Amy?

723
00:39:28.617 --> 00:39:30.408
- Right!

724
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:35.455
I'm gonna get another
bottle of wine.

725
00:39:35.499 --> 00:39:37.207
They keep the best
ones in the cellar.

726
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:45.090
- She's fun.

727
00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:47.008
- She comes off a
bit harsh sometimes.

728
00:39:47.052 --> 00:39:51.096
But the truth is she's
a really good friend

729
00:39:51.139 --> 00:39:54.891
and she's been there
for me for a lot.

730
00:39:58.772 --> 00:40:01.398
You know. you remind
me of someone.

731
00:40:02.651 --> 00:40:04.859
or maybe we've run into each
other before or something.

732
00:40:06.822 --> 00:40:08.405
Where did you say you were from?

733
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:13.660
- I see you. you know.

734
00:40:16.206 --> 00:40:17.163
- I'm sorry.

735
00:40:27.134 --> 00:40:29.676
- I found us something a
little more exciting than wine.

736
00:40:30.846 --> 00:40:32.512
(Amy chuckles)

737
00:40:34.391 --> 00:40:37.142
(water pattering)

738
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.865
(mysterious music)

739
00:41:24.316 --> 00:41:25.064
- Amy?

740
00:41:46.755 --> 00:41:49.130
Amy. if you're gonna
borrow my stuff.

741
00:41:49.174 --> 00:41:50.798
you need to put it
back when you're done.

742
00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:51.966
- [Amy] I don't know what
you're talking about.

743
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.343
- My perfume.

744
00:41:53.386 --> 00:41:55.053
- [Amy] I didn't take it.

745
00:41:55.096 --> 00:41:55.887
- Right.

746
00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:12.278
- Hey guys. Tara here.

747
00:42:12.322 --> 00:42:14.489
As promised the
view from the porch.

748
00:42:14.533 --> 00:42:16.407
There are worst
places to work. right?

749
00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:17.909
I'm about to head
down to the lake.

750
00:42:17.953 --> 00:42:18.868
and I'm gonna try to
convince my friend

751
00:42:18.912 --> 00:42:20.036
to do some modeling for me

752
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.080
so we can test out the
new portraiture lens.

753
00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:26.876
(ominous music)

754
00:42:29.798 --> 00:42:31.339
Hey guys. Tara here.

755
00:42:31.383 --> 00:42:33.633
As promised the
view from the porch.

756
00:42:33.677 --> 00:42:35.468
There are worst
places to work. right?

757
00:42:35.512 --> 00:42:37.011
I'm about to head
down to the lake.

758
00:42:37.055 --> 00:42:37.804
and I'm gonna try to
convince my friend

759
00:42:37.847 --> 00:42:38.972
to do some modeling for me

760
00:42:39.015 --> 00:42:42.767
so we can test out the
new portraiture lens.

761
00:42:44.104 --> 00:42:46.104
(Tara gasps)

762
00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:04.998
(mysterious music)

763
00:43:17.637 --> 00:43:20.471
(electronic music)

764
00:43:26.187 --> 00:43:29.856
(both laughing)

765
00:43:30.317 --> 00:43:33.401
- [Lucas] Oh. there you are.

766
00:43:33.445 --> 00:43:36.070
- Hey.
- Amy. can I talk to you?

767
00:43:36.114 --> 00:43:37.030
There's something
I need to show you.

768
00:43:37.073 --> 00:43:38.114
- Right now?

769
00:43:38.158 --> 00:43:39.782
- Yes. right now.

770
00:43:39.826 --> 00:43:40.742
- We're just getting started.

771
00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:42.827
- Have a drink. babe.

781

- Nothing.

783
00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:30.249
It was nothing.

784
00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.464
- You wanna show me instead?

785
00:44:37.384 --> 00:44:39.133

(Lucas laughs)

801
00:45:56.421 --> 00:45:59.130
- Hey there sleepy head.

802
00:45:59.174 --> 00:46:00.548
How are you feeling?

803
00:46:00.592 --> 00:46:02.300
- Why didn't you wake me up?

804
00:46:02.343 --> 00:46:03.509
- I figured I'd wait
till I was finished

805
00:46:03.553 --> 00:46:05.678
making breakfast first.

806
00:46:05.722 --> 00:46:08.473
This one isn't used to
that kind of a good time.

807
00:46:08.516 --> 00:46:09.640
- I'd never have known.

808
00:46:11.436 --> 00:46:13.102
- Have you seen
my phone charger?

809
00:46:13.146 --> 00:46:13.936
I can't find it.

810
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.730
- Oh. that's not surprising.

811
00:46:15.774 --> 00:46:18.357
She's always losing. slash
misplacing her things.

812
00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:20.401
- Am I?

813
00:46:20.445 --> 00:46:21.819
This is news to me.

814
00:46:23.323 --> 00:46:25.156
- Well. somebody woke up

815
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.407
on the wrong side of
the bed this morning.

816
00:46:26.451 --> 00:46:29.577
- Well. someone should
stop borrowing my stuff

817
00:46:29.621 --> 00:46:32.205
and then misplacing it and
accusing me of losing it.

818
00:46:32.457 --> 00:46:35.833
(Amy titters)

819
00:46:36.961 --> 00:46:38.169
- I think I'll go take
a look at the car.

820
00:46:38.213 --> 00:46:39.212
- You don't have to do that.
- I know.

821
00:46:39.255 --> 00:46:41.088
I just figure it's
safer out there

822
00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:42.715
than in this line of fire.

823
00:46:42.759 --> 00:46:44.091
- The keys are by the door.

824
00:46:45.178 --> 00:46:47.887
- Play nicely.
(Amy giggles)

825
00:46:50.517 --> 00:46:52.433
- Play nice.

826
00:46:52.477 --> 00:46:54.644
Great. now he thinks
we're psychos.

827
00:46:54.687 --> 00:46:55.561
- We?

828
00:46:55.605 --> 00:46:56.312
You're the one being paranoid.

829
00:46:56.356 --> 00:46:58.731
I'm just making pancakes.

830
00:46:59.692 --> 00:47:01.275
- I'm not paranoid.

831
00:47:01.319 --> 00:47:02.568
It's my stuffy. Amy. and
it's not where I put it.

832
00:47:02.612 --> 00:47:06.531
- Okay. everybody
misplaces things.

833
00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:07.990
You had a lot to
drink last night.

834
00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:09.992
you probably just don't
remember where you put it.

835
00:47:10.036 --> 00:47:11.577
- Or you don't.

836
00:47:11.621 --> 00:47:13.955
I wasn't the only one
drinking last night.

837
00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:16.332
- Okay. I'll keep
my eyes open for it.

838
00:47:16.376 --> 00:47:18.626
It's not that big of a deal.

839
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:20.294
- It is a big deal.

840
00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:21.754
It's my stuff. Amy.

841
00:47:21.798 --> 00:47:23.297
And you always do this.

842
00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:25.424
You always think you can
just take whatever you want.

843
00:47:25.468 --> 00:47:28.886
- I'm always taking your things?

844
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:30.304
- Yes.

845
00:47:30.348 --> 00:47:32.306
There are no boundaries with
you and there should be.

846
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:34.225
- Okay. we are talking
about a phone charger here.

847
00:47:34.269 --> 00:47:35.268
Do you hear yourself?

848
00:47:35.311 --> 00:47:36.435
- It's not about
the phone charger.

849
00:47:36.479 --> 00:47:37.478
- Then what is it about?
- It's about...

850
00:47:39.732 --> 00:47:41.357
(Tara sighs)

851
00:47:41.401 --> 00:47:43.192
Forget it.

852
00:47:46.698 --> 00:47:49.532
- Are you upset because
Lucas was coming on to me?

853
00:47:53.496 --> 00:47:54.287
Tara.

854
00:47:57.333 --> 00:48:00.710
You have been talking
all week about Derek

855
00:48:00.795 --> 00:48:03.921
and how much you miss
him. and care about him.

856
00:48:03.965 --> 00:48:06.883
and wanna get back
to see his show.

857
00:48:06.926 --> 00:48:09.927
Does any of this indicate
to me that you're interested

858
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:11.721
in hooking up with
random mountain man?

859
00:48:12.724 --> 00:48:13.848
No!

860
00:48:13.892 --> 00:48:16.767
I don't understand why
you're upset with me

861
00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:20.813
when I had no idea that you
were trying to impress Lucas.

862
00:48:20.857 --> 00:48:21.522
- I'm not trying to impress him.

863
00:48:21.566 --> 00:48:23.733
- Oh my god.

864
00:48:23.776 --> 00:48:25.443
I don't even know what
we're talking about anymore.

865
00:48:25.486 --> 00:48:26.611
Tara. I can't keep up.

866
00:48:26.654 --> 00:48:27.945
- It's the way you're saying it.

867
00:48:27.989 --> 00:48:30.031
I'm not trying to impress him.

868
00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:32.158
I'm just--
- You're just what?

869
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:37.622
(sighs) This is not
what I was looking for.

870
00:48:37.665 --> 00:48:42.084
I don't know why I go out of
my way to be so nice to you

871
00:48:42.128 --> 00:48:43.461
when you treat me like this.

872
00:48:43.504 --> 00:48:47.048
when you get
randomly angry at me

873
00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:50.176
and accuse me of doing
things that I'm not doing.

874
00:48:50.219 --> 00:48:51.594
- You are doing it though. Amy

875
00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:55.598
- Look. if you want
Lucas. go for it.

876
00:48:55.642 --> 00:48:57.516
But don't get mad at
me for being myself

877
00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.061
and trying to have fun.

878
00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:00.853
just because you don't
have the strength

879
00:49:00.897 --> 00:49:02.563
to go after what you want.

880
00:49:05.485 --> 00:49:08.277
(Lucas exhales)

881
00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:15.993
- You fixed it.

882
00:49:16.037 --> 00:49:16.494
- It just need a little love.

883
00:49:18.539 --> 00:49:20.039
- You're my hero.

884
00:49:20.083 --> 00:49:21.749
(Lucas chuckles)

885
00:49:21.793 --> 00:49:22.541
- Anytime.

886
00:49:22.585 --> 00:49:24.627
(calm music)

887
00:49:24.671 --> 00:49:25.878
(birds chirping)

888
00:49:25.922 --> 00:49:27.505
- Breakfast is ready
and the battle is over.

889
00:49:27.548 --> 00:49:29.840
if you wanna come back inside.

890
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:33.219
Sorry you had to hear
all that. Amy and I.

891
00:49:33.262 --> 00:49:35.179
- Oh no. it's all good.

892
00:49:35.223 --> 00:49:36.722
No need to explain.

893
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:44.105
- Well. come in
whenever you're ready.

894
00:49:55.326 --> 00:49:59.412
♪ Something spoke to me as
I looked in your eyes. ♪

895
00:49:59.455 --> 00:50:03.708
♪ Without a question I
am down for this ride ♪

896
00:50:03.751 --> 00:50:06.502
♪ You may be crazy.
you may be sunshine ♪

897
00:50:06.546 --> 00:50:07.878
- Well. hello there.

898
00:50:07.922 --> 00:50:09.964
You're gonna join me
before it gets cold?

899
00:50:10.008 --> 00:50:12.174
- It smells delicious.

900
00:50:12.218 --> 00:50:15.386
Let me just wash up.
and I'll be right back.

901
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.722
- I swear you were the last
person to use the charger. Amy.

902
00:50:17.765 --> 00:50:19.598
- I will literally
buy you 50 chargers

903
00:50:19.642 --> 00:50:22.184
if you never bring
this up again.

904
00:50:22.228 --> 00:50:23.811
- Look. I need to
show you something.

905
00:50:23.855 --> 00:50:25.104
This is what I was
talking about last night.

906
00:50:25.148 --> 00:50:27.440
There was someone watching
us yesterday morning.

907
00:50:27.483 --> 00:50:28.983
and I caught them on tape.

908
00:50:29.027 --> 00:50:31.902
(mysterious music)

909
00:50:35.074 --> 00:50:36.657
- The suspense is killing me.

910
00:50:36.701 --> 00:50:38.034
- It's gone.

911
00:50:38.077 --> 00:50:39.452
- What's gone?
- My vlog file. it's gone.

912
00:50:40.538 --> 00:50:43.372
- You know what I think.

913
00:50:43.416 --> 00:50:45.708
I think we need to put
away the brown liquors

914
00:50:45.752 --> 00:50:47.543
and stick with the wine tonight.

915
00:50:47.587 --> 00:50:49.503
- No. it was here. I saw it.

916
00:50:51.758 --> 00:50:53.299
- Thanks for waiting.

917
00:50:53.342 --> 00:50:55.009
This looks incredible.

918
00:50:58.056 --> 00:50:58.846
You okay?

919
00:51:00.641 --> 00:51:04.018
- Yeah. I'm fine.

920
00:51:04.062 --> 00:51:05.269
- Pancake?
- Thank you.

921
00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:07.688
Tara. pancakes?

922
00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:18.657
(mysterious music)

923
00:52:16.259 --> 00:52:19.593
(camera shutter clicks)

924
00:52:24.433 --> 00:52:26.976
(waves lapping)

925
00:52:31.524 --> 00:52:34.817
(camera shutter clicking)

926
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.487
- All right.

927
00:52:40.366 --> 00:52:42.575
(tense music)

928
00:52:42.618 --> 00:52:44.034
(Tara gasps)

929
00:52:44.078 --> 00:52:44.827
- Sorry.

930
00:52:45.788 --> 00:52:47.413
- That's okay.

931
00:52:47.456 --> 00:52:48.247
- This seat taken?

932
00:52:49.542 --> 00:52:52.042
I gotta stop creeping
up on you like this.

933
00:52:53.754 --> 00:52:57.089
(Lucas sighs)

934
00:52:58.843 --> 00:53:01.635
(Lucas exhales)

935
00:53:05.766 --> 00:53:09.685
- Last night when you
said you've seen me.

936
00:53:09.729 --> 00:53:10.728
what did you mean by that?

937
00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:23.908
- I haven't been
completely honest with you.

938
00:53:24.994 --> 00:53:25.784
I didn't exactly
need a phone charge.

939
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.539
When I saw you yesterday

940
00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:33.792
sitting right here actually.

941
00:53:36.714 --> 00:53:37.338
I just knew.

942
00:53:39.926 --> 00:53:39.965
- Knew what?

943
00:53:43.262 --> 00:53:45.930
- That I finally found
what I was looking for.

944
00:53:47.892 --> 00:53:50.851
That everything else up until
that moment didn't matter.

945
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:56.232
What?

946
00:53:57.151 --> 00:53:59.860
Is that really so
hard to believe?

947
00:53:59.904 --> 00:54:02.071
- I don't know. Lucas.

948
00:54:04.784 --> 00:54:05.991
I don't feel like
it works like that.

949
00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:08.410
Guys like you.

950
00:54:10.039 --> 00:54:10.788
and girls like me.

951
00:54:16.087 --> 00:54:19.713
- You really don't
see it. do you?

952
00:54:21.467 --> 00:54:23.217
- Besides I thought you and Amy

953
00:54:23.261 --> 00:54:24.802
had something going
on last night.

954
00:54:24.845 --> 00:54:24.885
- Amy?

955
00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:27.680
- Yeah.

956
00:54:32.395 --> 00:54:33.644
- Can I tell you a secret?

957
00:54:46.701 --> 00:54:47.950
You're wrong.

958
00:55:02.425 --> 00:55:05.259
- You said your car's
around here somewhere.

959
00:55:13.769 --> 00:55:15.894
(Derek knocking)

960
00:55:15.938 --> 00:55:17.646
- [Derek] Tara.

961
00:55:18.566 --> 00:55:19.273
(Derek knocking)

962
00:55:19.317 --> 00:55:21.400
Tara. are you in there?

963
00:55:22.945 --> 00:55:22.985
Tara.

964
00:55:27.825 --> 00:55:30.367
- Derek?

965
00:55:30.411 --> 00:55:31.660
What are you doing here?

966
00:55:32.288 --> 00:55:34.747
- [Derek] Listen.
I made a mistake.

967
00:55:35.416 --> 00:55:38.500
- Don't you think it's
a little late for that?

968
00:55:38.544 --> 00:55:39.710
- [Derek] I'm hoping not.

969
00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:41.545
Can I come in?

970
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:42.629
- How did you find me?

971
00:55:44.175 --> 00:55:46.383
- Come on. you post
your entire life online.

972
00:55:46.427 --> 00:55:48.385
- I didn't post anything
about being here.

973
00:55:48.429 --> 00:55:49.595
- Your last vlog. you said

974
00:55:49.638 --> 00:55:50.804
that you were at a
friend's family's lake.

975
00:55:50.848 --> 00:55:52.056
It doesn't take a
genius to look up a lake

976
00:55:52.099 --> 00:55:53.098
with Amy's last name.

977
00:55:55.478 --> 00:55:55.976
(titters) Okay.

978
00:55:58.522 --> 00:55:59.730
- What do you want Derek?

979
00:56:02.193 --> 00:56:04.818
- I want you to
come back with me.

980
00:56:04.862 --> 00:56:06.695
I want you to come
to the show tonight.

981
00:56:08.532 --> 00:56:10.616
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

982
00:56:10.659 --> 00:56:11.700
- Why not?

983
00:56:11.744 --> 00:56:13.410
- Because you dumped me Derek.

984
00:56:13.454 --> 00:56:14.828
In a voicemail!

985
00:56:14.872 --> 00:56:16.246
- I didn't dump you.

986
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:18.165
I was freaking out
about the show.

987
00:56:18.209 --> 00:56:19.541
I made a couple mistakes

988
00:56:19.585 --> 00:56:23.295
and I was just confused
about what that all meant.

989
00:56:23.339 --> 00:56:24.004
- Made a couple mistakes?

990
00:56:24.048 --> 00:56:26.006
- But that's over now.

991
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:27.466
And I wanna fix things with you.

992
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:28.592
- What mistakes?

993
00:56:28.636 --> 00:56:29.843
What's over?

994
00:56:31.514 --> 00:56:32.262
- It doesn't matter?

995
00:56:32.306 --> 00:56:33.138
- I think it does.

996
00:56:33.182 --> 00:56:34.556
- You're not listening to me.

997
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.934
I messed up and I
wanna fix things.

998
00:56:36.977 --> 00:56:38.519
I wanna make things
right with you.

999
00:56:38.562 --> 00:56:39.686
- You need to leave.

1000
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.563
- Not until you say
you're coming with me.

1001
00:56:41.607 --> 00:56:43.232
- I'm not gonna do that. Derek.

1002
00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:45.776
- Baby. I drove all the
way out here because

1003
00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:49.905
I wanted to tell you that I--
- What's going on here?

1004
00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:52.366
- Who are you?

1005
00:56:55.371 --> 00:56:55.994
- Lucas meet Derek.

1006
00:56:56.038 --> 00:56:58.997
Derek this is Lucas.

1007
00:56:59.041 --> 00:57:00.082
Derek was just leaving.

1008
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:03.919
- So you're the
other car outside?

1009
00:57:07.967 --> 00:57:10.050
Wait are you two--
- Derek. you can't be here.

1010
00:57:12.304 --> 00:57:13.512
- I asked you a question.

1011
00:57:16.058 --> 00:57:17.516
Here I am feeling all
terrible about what I've done.

1012
00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:20.018
and you're out here banging
some backwards rando.

1013
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:22.980
Where'd you even find this guy?

1014
00:57:25.985 --> 00:57:27.776
Hang on.

1015
00:57:29.321 --> 00:57:30.529
Don't I know you?

1016
00:57:30.573 --> 00:57:31.989
- You can't be here. Derek.

1017
00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:33.323
- Lucas. you said.

1018
00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:36.910
No. that's not right.

1019
00:57:39.457 --> 00:57:40.873
You're sleeping with my girl?

1020
00:57:42.585 --> 00:57:43.709
- She's not your girl.

1021
00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:44.585
- Guys.

1022
00:57:45.254 --> 00:57:47.212
You really need to go Derek.

1023
00:57:47.256 --> 00:57:50.674
If you wait much longer. you're
gonna be late for your show.

1024
00:57:53.179 --> 00:57:55.679
- So it's gonna
be like that. huh?

1025
00:58:00.561 --> 00:58:02.644
She's all yours pal.

1026
00:58:02.688 --> 00:58:04.521
Even with the pictures.
it wasn't worth it.

1027
00:58:12.114 --> 00:58:15.365
She was a better lay
than you'll ever be.

1028
00:58:36.347 --> 00:58:37.221
Stupid waste of time.

1029
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:46.772
(car tires screeching)

1030
00:58:46.815 --> 00:58:49.399
(train honks)

1031
00:58:49.443 --> 00:58:50.484
Oh. son of a!

1032
00:58:51.278 --> 00:58:54.613
(tense music)

1033
00:59:07.169 --> 00:59:10.170
(Amy knocks)
(Tara sobbing)

1034
00:59:10.214 --> 00:59:11.505
- Knock. knock.

1035
00:59:32.111 --> 00:59:34.236
- I'm guessing you
heard all that.

1036
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.070
- Yeah.

1037
00:59:36.782 --> 00:59:39.783
- He was cheating on
me the whole time. Amy.

1038
00:59:40.661 --> 00:59:43.787
(Tara sobs)

1039
00:59:43.998 --> 00:59:46.498
- I'm such an idiot.
- No.

1040
00:59:46.542 --> 00:59:47.082
You're not an idiot.

1041
00:59:47.126 --> 00:59:48.292
Come here. oh.

1042
00:59:49.253 --> 00:59:52.921
(poignant music)

1043
01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:18.196
(ominous music)

1044
01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.979
- Well. I knew I recognized
you from somewhere.

1045
01:00:51.023 --> 01:00:52.147
So is that how long
this has been going on?

1046
01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:54.816
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1047
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.778
- No. I knew it was you
from the destiny party.

1048
01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.529
What was that about a
year and a half ago.

1049
01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:02.366
You've been screwing
her all this time?

1050
01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:06.453
That lying bitch!

1051
01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:07.245
Tara!

1052
01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:09.456
(tense music)

1053
01:01:29.395 --> 01:01:31.853
(birds cawing)

1054
01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:46.785
- There you are.
- Hey.

1055
01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:50.038
Sorry. I just had to
throw something in my car.

1056
01:01:50.082 --> 01:01:51.373
Is she okay?

1057
01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:53.917
- She'll be fine.

1058
01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:59.339
She and Derek just had
this connection. I guess.

1059
01:02:00.843 --> 01:02:02.426
They'll be doing
this song and dance

1060
01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:04.428
for a very long time. I think.

1061
01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:09.766
- It seemed pretty over to me.

1062
01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:11.059
- How cute.

1063
01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:14.271
Wishful thinking.

1064
01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:18.108
I'm gonna get a drink.

1065
01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:19.067
You want one?

1066
01:02:37.963 --> 01:02:41.214
(Tara exhales)

1067
01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:42.382
- Hey guys. Tara here.

1068
01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:45.927
It's now day two of
working in paradise.

1069
01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:47.304
Some technical difficulties

1070
01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:49.139
led to me losing
yesterday's vlog.

1071
01:02:49.183 --> 01:02:50.265
Bummer. I know.

1072
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:51.558
but I'm very excited
to share with you

1073
01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:54.561
some pictures I took using
this portraiture lens.

1074
01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:57.147
(ominous music)

1075
01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:01.568

- Idiot. Tara.

1087
01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:10.971
(waves lapping)

1088
01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:12.472
(Tara gasps)

1089
01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:13.598
(tense music)

1090
01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:14.015
John!

1091
01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:17.602
He died. Amy

1092
01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:17.686
Ten years ago

1093
01:04:19.147 --> 01:04:20.355
(waves lapping)

1094
01:04:20.399 --> 01:04:24.067
You're such an idiot.
Mom and Dad know it too.

1095
01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:30.407
You're never going to be
able to move forward until

1096
01:04:30.450 --> 01:05:06.401
you let go of your past.

1097
01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:07.986
(insects chirping)

1098
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.363
(door creaks)

1099
01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:43.438
Amy.

1100
01:05:47.653 --> 01:05:48.902
- No Tara. wait.

1101
01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:51.237
Tara.

1102
01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:56.409
Tara. it was an accident.
- An accident?

1103
01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:57.494
- You know I would never
do anything to hurt you.

1104
01:05:57.537 --> 01:05:59.579
- Oh. yeah. you
wouldn't do anything.

1105
01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:02.207
Nothing is ever
your doing. is it?

1106
01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:03.416
Unless. of course it's something

1107
01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.793
that I need to thank you for.

1108
01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:07.879
something amazing. like
you bringing poor. broke.

1109
01:06:07.923 --> 01:06:10.465
inadequate.
heartbroken little me

1110
01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:12.509
out to one of your family's
incredible properties

1111
01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:13.927
so we can have a girls' getaway

1112
01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:15.220
that's supposedly
all for my benefit.

1113
01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:18.098
where you tell me to
go for it with a guy.

1114
01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.474
But what you really mean is

1115
01:06:19.518 --> 01:06:22.143
how dare I ever think he
would choose me over you!

1116
01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:27.357
You're sad. Amy.

1117
01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:30.819
All you are is a needy.
empty. selfish. spoiled brat

1118
01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:31.611
who would stab a
friend in the back

1119
01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:32.487
the first chance she gets.

1120
01:06:32.531 --> 01:06:34.572
- Yeah. okay. play the victim.

1121
01:06:34.616 --> 01:06:37.200
Oh. poor Tara.

1122
01:06:37.244 --> 01:06:39.077
Oh. I'm so responsible.

1123
01:06:39.121 --> 01:06:40.954
I work so hard.

1124
01:06:40.998 --> 01:06:42.747
I think I'm so much
better than everybody else

1125
01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:45.375
because my family has no
money and my parents hate me.

1126
01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:47.210
And. oo. I wanna be a
famous photographer.

1127
01:06:47.254 --> 01:06:50.046
and my life is terrible.

1128
01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:51.214
- Screw you. Amy.

1129
01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:53.425
Oh. wait. Lucas
already did that.

1130
01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:55.719
- That's what this is about?

1131
01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:57.345
It's just sex. Tara.

1132
01:06:57.389 --> 01:07:00.140
Maybe if you weren't such a
prude somebody would do you.

1133
01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:01.683
- Shut up.
- Maybe that's the reason

1134
01:07:01.727 --> 01:07:04.269
your boyfriend was so eager
to get in bed with me too.

1135
01:07:06.398 --> 01:07:07.188
- What?

1136
01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:12.360
- Nobody likes a
sob story. Tara.

1137
01:07:12.404 --> 01:07:14.904
Your life is no more
difficult than anybody else's.

1138
01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:16.322
You're just too
scared to admit that

1139
01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:19.075
maybe it's you who's
not measuring up.

1140
01:07:21.413 --> 01:07:24.664
Maybe it was the wrong
sibling that drowned that day.

1141
01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:32.672
- We're done.

1142
01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:36.426
I never wanna see or
hear from you ever again.

1143
01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.654
(insects chirping)

1144
01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:17.926
(car engine stuttering)

1145
01:08:17.969 --> 01:08:20.512
(ominous music)

1146
01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:36.486
- Let me take a look.
- Get away from me.

1147
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:38.863
- Let me just take a quick--
- Stay away.

1148
01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:39.364
- I'm only trying to help.

1149
01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.199
- Tara.

1150
01:08:41.243 --> 01:08:43.201
Tara. I'm so. so sorry.
- Stop talking.

1151
01:08:43.245 --> 01:08:45.870
- I don't know why I
said that. it was stupid.

1152
01:08:45.914 --> 01:08:46.663
- Just stay away
from me both of you.

1153
01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:48.706
- Can we just please talk?

1154
01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:51.084
- I'm getting out
of here right now.

1155
01:08:51.128 --> 01:08:53.253
Take me to town.
I'm gonna get a bus.

1156
01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:54.420
It's too late.

1157
01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.589
There's not gonna be a
bus until the morning.

1158
01:08:58.218 --> 01:08:59.968
- You did this to my car.
- Me?

1159
01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.177
You saw me fix it.

1160
01:09:01.221 --> 01:09:03.596
- What are you playing at?
- You're upset.

1161
01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.431
and that is totally
understandable.

1162
01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.391
but it is very late. and--

1163
01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:09.102
- Why did you do this to my car?

1164
01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:12.939
- You don't think that maybe
it was your pissed off ex?

1165
01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.651
- He has a point. Tara.

1166
01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:19.279
- I would never--
- Can I just say one thing.

1167
01:09:21.575 --> 01:09:24.159
Things got ugly in
there and I'm sorry.

1168
01:09:24.202 --> 01:09:25.952
I really. really am.

1169
01:09:25.996 --> 01:09:28.288
I didn't mean what I said and
I know I can't take it back

1170
01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:32.125
but if we could just go back
inside and sleep it off.

1171
01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:33.251
Lucas can bring us into
town in the morning.

1172
01:09:35.463 --> 01:09:37.589
Don't you think that
makes the most sense?

1173
01:09:40.802 --> 01:09:40.842
Tara. please!

1174
01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:14.709
Tara. I'm really. really sorry.

1175
01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:22.133
I'll see you in the morning.

1176
01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:27.138
(Tara sighs)

1177
01:10:38.652 --> 01:10:40.026
- It's not what you think.

1178
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.109
- Just go.

1179
01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:45.365
(sad music)

1180
01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:10.598
(ominous music)

1181
01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:42.338
(Velcro rips)

1182
01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:09.509
(tense music)

1183
01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:12.136
(camera beeping)

1184
01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:36.285
(keys clattering)

1185
01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:38.788
(Tara gasps)

1186
01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:31.215
(mysterious music)

1187
01:15:21.935 --> 01:15:23.434
- Oh. it's okay. it's okay.

1188
01:15:23.478 --> 01:15:25.102
Please. don't be scared. Tara.

1189
01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:26.437
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1190
01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:30.858
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

1191
01:15:34.531 --> 01:15:36.697
He wasn't a good guy.

1192
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:40.535
He was using you.

1193
01:15:40.578 --> 01:15:42.286
and he was sleeping
with your best friend.

1194
01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:44.330
among others.

1195
01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:48.918
He didn't come close
to treating you

1196
01:15:48.962 --> 01:15:50.711
the way that you
deserve to be treated.

1197
01:15:52.632 --> 01:15:55.049
Now. you finding me with Amy
was not part of the plan.

1198
01:15:55.093 --> 01:15:58.052
You just got back home a little
bit sooner than I'd hoped.

1199
01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:02.139
If you had just given
me a bit more time.

1200
01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:05.434
I would've been able
to get rid of her too.

1201
01:16:07.355 --> 01:16:09.021
You're the only
woman for me. Tara.

1202
01:16:09.607 --> 01:16:13.025
You have always been
the only one for me.

1203
01:16:14.112 --> 01:16:14.860
(Tara grunts)

1204
01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:17.071
(Tara panting)

1205
01:16:17.115 --> 01:16:17.905
Tara!

1206
01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:27.248
Where are you running. Tara?

1207
01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:31.627
I found you before and
I will find you again.

1208
01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:34.297
I will always...

1209
01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:36.841
find you.

1210
01:16:44.601 --> 01:16:46.392
(Tara gasps)

1211
01:16:46.436 --> 01:16:50.354
(Tara groans)

1212
01:16:50.398 --> 01:16:53.024
(Tara groans)

1213
01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:57.278
(Tara grunts)

1214
01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:02.116
(Tara sobbing)

1215
01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.716
(water gushing)

1216
01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:23.471
- Tara!

1217
01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:30.186
- She was a better lay
than you'll ever be.

1218
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:31.312
- [Amy Voiceover] Maybe
it was the wrong sibling

1219
01:17:31.356 --> 01:17:33.064
that drowned that day.

1220
01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:44.992
- You waking up there?

1221
01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:49.288
I tried to be gentle.

1222
01:17:51.751 --> 01:17:52.875
I'm sorry. but you
made me do that.

1223
01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:59.548
You know I would never wanna
do anything to hurt you.

1224
01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:03.052
I gave you a sedative
for the pain.

1225
01:18:03.096 --> 01:18:04.345
I hope that's okay.

1226
01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:06.931
We're off soon. but
you have to promise me.

1227
01:18:09.811 --> 01:18:11.310
don't do anything stupid.

1228
01:18:13.981 --> 01:18:14.814
I don't have to tie
you up like her.

1229
01:18:16.818 --> 01:18:21.737
- Where is she?
(Lucas shushes)

1230
01:18:21.781 --> 01:18:23.739
- We were doing so well.

1231
01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:28.452
We finally had our
moment at the lake.

1232
01:18:28.496 --> 01:18:28.869
That connection.

1233
01:18:31.249 --> 01:18:31.872
That's why I knew it was time...

1234
01:18:35.128 --> 01:18:35.835
Time to take care of Amy.

1235
01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:39.088
Derek.

1236
01:18:40.508 --> 01:18:41.924
Derek was not part of the plan.

1237
01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:45.010
I was surprised
when he showed up.

1238
01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.096
I figured I could
deal with him later.

1239
01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:49.682
And then when he
decided to come back.

1240
01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:51.600
I couldn't have that.

1241
01:18:52.979 --> 01:18:55.730
I had to protect you.

1242
01:18:58.276 --> 01:18:59.567
- What do you want from us?

1243
01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:01.944
- Us?

1244
01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:07.450
How many times do
I have to tell you?

1245
01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:08.492
There's only you.

1246
01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.370
It's always only been you.

1247
01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:16.709
Love at first sight.

1248
01:19:16.753 --> 01:19:17.501
It's real.

1249
01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:22.047
- You can't love someone
after two days. Lucas.

1250
01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:25.134
- Oh no.

1251
01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.846
No. I have been in
love with you for years

1252
01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:32.057
since sixth grade

1253
01:19:33.478 --> 01:19:35.436
when you rescued me.

1254
01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.854
Those boys were harassing me

1255
01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:38.564
and you told them
to leave me alone.

1256
01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:41.901
And then you reached out your
hand and you helped me up.

1257
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:48.240
- Brian?

1258
01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:51.994
- I knew you would remember me.

1259
01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:55.915
I found my middle
name suited me better.

1260
01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:55.998
Anyway.

1261
01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:01.587
I know it now.

1262
01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:04.089
just like I knew it then.

1263
01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:08.385
I would do anything for you.

1264
01:20:11.057 --> 01:20:12.014
I lost you for a
little while there...

1265
01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:18.854
after I took your brother
out of the picture.

1266
01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:22.358
He was such a
terrible bully to you.

1267
01:20:24.195 --> 01:20:26.529
And I will never forget
the look in his eyes

1268
01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:27.988
the moment before
he hit the water.

1269
01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:35.079
And things didn't go
as planned after that.

1270
01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:35.996
You disappeared.

1271
01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.164
I had no way of finding you.

1272
01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:39.500
I thought he was over for us.

1273
01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:43.295
So you can only
imagine my surprise

1274
01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:44.421
when I'm researching
camera equipment

1275
01:20:44.465 --> 01:20:47.132
and suddenly your
beautiful face pops up

1276
01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:49.260
telling me all about it.

1277
01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:51.053
It's fate.

1278
01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:55.975
You can't ignore that Tara.

1279
01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.226
So I dropped everything

1280
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:59.144
and I moved out here
to be close to you.

1281
01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:01.272
And I've been following
your life ever since.

1282
01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:03.732
just waiting for
the perfect moment.

1283
01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:06.235
No. the pieces. they
just fell into place.

1284
01:21:06.279 --> 01:21:09.947
I just. I knew that
this would be my chance.

1285
01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:14.577
my chance to finally show
you who really loves you.

1286
01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:18.706
I had to take care
of those that don't.

1287
01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:23.210
You're ready.

1288
01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:33.554
(water lapping)

1289
01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:37.099
(fire crackling)

1290
01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.852
- Oh. no.

1291
01:21:42.773 --> 01:21:45.107
(Amy sobbing)

1292
01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:51.780
(Amy groaning)

1293
01:21:51.824 --> 01:21:52.615
- Shh!

1294
01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:55.993
- Stop!
- What?

1295
01:21:58.581 --> 01:22:01.665
Why are you still defending
this ungrateful. spoiled whore.

1296
01:22:01.709 --> 01:22:03.083
She has done nothing
but betray you.

1297
01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:06.503
Nothing!

1298
01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:15.429
- You're right.

1299
01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:18.724
She is an ungrateful.
spoiled whore.

1300
01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:26.106
You helped me see that. Lucas.

1301
01:22:28.402 --> 01:22:29.193
I had no idea that
there could be

1302
01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:31.320
someone out there like you.

1303
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:33.906
someone who really listens.

1304
01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:35.157
really understands.

1305
01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:39.495
who takes actions to
protect those he loves.

1306
01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:43.165
And it's made me realize...

1307
01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:46.126
I hate her.

1308
01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:52.341
As long as I've known you.
I've been there for you.

1309
01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:54.593
I've gone where you wanted.
driven where you wanted.

1310
01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:56.095
dressed how you want.

1311
01:22:56.138 --> 01:22:58.263
Put my life on hold

1312
01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:01.266
because something on your agenda
was always more important.

1313
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.686
And for what?

1314
01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:05.980
So you could tease
me for being broke.

1315
01:23:06.023 --> 01:23:08.774
insult my career. sleep
with my boyfriend?

1316
01:23:10.528 --> 01:23:13.988
Why do you even claim
to want to be my friend?

1317
01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:15.781
Is it an ego boost?

1318
01:23:15.825 --> 01:23:17.992
Does putting me down
make you feel better

1319
01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:19.243
about your pathetic life?

1320
01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:24.081
Let me do it.

1321
01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:34.383
- I wouldn't want your
hands to get dirty. my love.

1322
01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:37.886
- You've been protecting
me my whole life.

1323
01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:45.686
My brother was awful.

1324
01:23:47.398 --> 01:23:48.188
- Yes.

1325
01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.357
- He was a monster.

1326
01:23:51.402 --> 01:23:52.192
- Yes.

1327
01:23:53.821 --> 01:23:55.404
- He made my life miserable.

1328
01:23:59.118 --> 01:24:00.284
and my parents miserable too.

1329
01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:03.912
When he died...

1330
01:24:06.042 --> 01:24:09.209
When he died. I felt
like I was living a lie.

1331
01:24:10.755 --> 01:24:12.337
pretending along with my parents

1332
01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:14.381
like he was such a
wonderful brother.

1333
01:24:15.468 --> 01:24:17.551
that he wasn't actually
my worst nightmare.

1334
01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:24.183
Why do we suddenly paint someone

1335
01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:25.934
in a different light
when they're gone?

1336
01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:28.270
My parents were destroyed.

1337
01:24:31.108 --> 01:24:34.860
It was like they didn't
have room for me anymore.

1338
01:24:34.904 --> 01:24:36.070
Even in death.

1339
01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:39.031
he still somehow tortured me.

1340
01:24:41.327 --> 01:24:42.242
I'm glad he's gone.

1341
01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:47.790
I can't pretend any longer.

1342
01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:49.875
Sometimes our lives
are just better

1343
01:24:49.919 --> 01:24:53.045
without those who would
otherwise bring us down.

1344
01:24:53.089 --> 01:24:55.422
(tense music)

1345
01:24:58.344 --> 01:24:59.176
You've taken care
of me long enough.

1346
01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:03.263
Let me do this for myself.

1347
01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:08.435
I'm sorry it had to
be this way. Amy.

1348
01:25:10.773 --> 01:25:11.605
But you were right.

1349
01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:14.149
I'm not gonna get anywhere

1350
01:25:14.193 --> 01:25:15.692
if I continue to
live in the past.

1351
01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.655
(Amy moaning)

1352
01:25:26.664 --> 01:25:27.704
Thank you. Lucas.

1353
01:25:36.423 --> 01:25:39.842
(Lucas groans)

1354
01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:48.100
(water splashes)

1355
01:25:49.687 --> 01:25:52.187
(Tara gasps)

1356
01:25:53.566 --> 01:25:55.607
(both groaning)

1357
01:25:55.651 --> 01:25:56.400
- Let's go.

1358
01:25:56.443 --> 01:25:57.818
Hurry. let's go.

1359
01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:16.545
(Amy screams)

1360
01:26:16.589 --> 01:26:18.422
- Oh my god!

1361
01:26:18.465 --> 01:26:19.381
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

1362
01:26:19.425 --> 01:26:21.550
- Amy. we have to get him out.

1363
01:26:21.594 --> 01:26:23.969
Just (groans). no. we can do it.

1364
01:26:24.013 --> 01:26:24.803
Help me Amy.

1365
01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:29.391
(Amy screams)
(Tara groans)

1366
01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:41.904
No.

1367
01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:43.363
Do you know how to drive stick?

1368
01:26:43.407 --> 01:26:44.781
- No. don't you?

1369
01:26:48.329 --> 01:26:49.036
(Tara groans)

1370
01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:52.789
(car engine turning over)

1371
01:26:53.751 --> 01:26:54.333
(car engine turning over)

1372
01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:55.500
- Okay. okay.

1373
01:26:56.587 --> 01:26:59.922
(Tara grunts)

1374
01:27:02.593 --> 01:27:04.760
(car engine turning over)

1375
01:27:04.803 --> 01:27:07.554
(tense music)

1376
01:27:07.598 --> 01:27:10.515
(engine revving)

1377
01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.184
- This can't be happening.

1378
01:27:12.228 --> 01:27:13.518
- Hurry.

1379
01:27:13.562 --> 01:27:15.896
Hurry Amy.
- You drive.

1380
01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:18.774
- You have to. you have
to do this one thing.

1381
01:27:18.817 --> 01:27:20.317
Just do it.
- I'm trying.

1382
01:27:20.361 --> 01:27:21.777
- Tara.

1383
01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.612
Please don't do
this to me again.

1384
01:27:25.032 --> 01:27:27.366
I will always find you.

1385
01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:28.825
I love you!

1386
01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:29.826
(Lucas screams)

1387
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:32.746
(Amy screams)

1388
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:34.498
(both panting)

1389
01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:56.603
- All right. this
is the last one.

1390
01:27:58.482 --> 01:28:00.607
- Thank you.
- No prob.

1391
01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:04.069
- Well. that's it.

1392
01:28:04.113 --> 01:28:05.612
My whole life
packed into one car.

1393
01:28:06.657 --> 01:28:07.447
- That's not true.

1394
01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:09.741
I'm not in there.

1395
01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:12.911
(both chuckle)

1396
01:28:12.997 --> 01:28:13.745
Hey.

1397
01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:16.790
I'm proud of you.

1398
01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:17.916
I really am.

1399
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.502
(calm music)

1400
01:28:20.546 --> 01:28:20.585
- You know what?

1401
01:28:22.756 --> 01:28:23.714
I'm proud of you too.

1402
01:28:25.259 --> 01:28:26.800
- We'll see.

1403
01:28:26.844 --> 01:28:28.593
Next time we talk. I might
be living on the streets.

1404
01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:31.388
- You know that
will never happen.

1405
01:28:31.432 --> 01:28:32.973
You'll always have
a place with me.

1406
01:28:35.311 --> 01:28:38.145
- And where's that
gonna be exactly?

1407
01:28:38.188 --> 01:28:41.481
- I mean. we'll see how
things go with the parents.

1408
01:28:41.525 --> 01:28:43.608
I'm just trying to
keep an open mind

1409
01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:45.110
and seeing where it leads me.

1410
01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:48.238
- Well.

1411
01:28:48.282 --> 01:28:52.451
you be sure to call me

1412
01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:54.619
the second that you arrive.

1413
01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:55.454
Okay?

1414
01:28:57.249 --> 01:28:59.624
I hear there are some
crazies around these parts.

1415
01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:01.585
(both chuckle)

1416
01:29:01.628 --> 01:29:04.004
- I'll call you
when I get there.

1417
01:29:04.048 --> 01:29:06.506
unless you call me first.
- Oh. you know me so well.

1418
01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:24.649
(Amy sighs)

1419
01:29:26.528 --> 01:29:28.278
- Got it.
