about that. Mrs. G.

- Hey Chloe. is it
weird for you sleeping

201
00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:58.859
in your mom's old room?

202
00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:01.644
- Nope. actually. I
wouldn't change it either.

203
00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:04.342
because it reminds me of her.

204

Just like every day
I wear this ring

205
00:10:06.344 --> 00:10:07.781
because it was hers

206
00:10:07.868 --> 00:10:10.305
and it just makes me feel
closer to her. I guess.

00:10:13.743 --> 00:10:15.179

my mom was our age

208

would never say that.

But. uh. I don't know.

214
00:10:27.496 --> 00:10:29.193
it's kind of hard for
me to answer that.

215
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.543
since my mom split when I was 2.

216

Based off of the outfits.

217
00:10:33.284 --> 00:10:35.504
uh. I don't really know
if I would really say yes

218
00:10:35.591 --> 00:10:39.464
but. um. it makes me wonder
what they did for fun back then?

219
00:10:39.551 --> 00:10:40.727

220

221

- You've never heard
of tipping cows?

222
00:10:44.992 --> 00:10:46.558
- Why would cows need
money. that's stupid.

223

224

230
00:11:00.137 --> 00:11:03.227
that I thought you might like
to wear to church tomorrow.

231
00:11:03.314 --> 00:11:06.230
It was your mother's favorite
dress when she was your age.

me to see what. okay.

I'm gonna look
ridiculous in this.

239
00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:29.123
- I'm gonna tell you the
same thing I told your mother

240
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.214
when she wanted to wear
overalls to church one Sunday.

241
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:35.042
When you're standing in church

242
00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:38.045
you are standing before
the throne of God.

243
00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:41.135
so don't you go
disrespecting Him

244
00:11:41.222 --> 00:11:44.529
by wearing the same thing
you'd wear out in the barn.

245
00:11:49.883 --> 00:11:53.713
Oh my. you don't know how much
you look like your mother.

except for the hair.

247
00:11:58.935 --> 00:12:01.416
But. although. I think
she'd like blue hair.

248
00:12:03.418 --> 00:12:05.725
- All right. I'll wear it.

249
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:11.948
- Now Sticks. there are
more dresses in the closet.

250
00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:14.255
- Yeah. Sticks. there are more
dresses for you to try on.

251

- Uhh. you know. as
tempting as that sounds.

252
00:12:16.823 --> 00:12:19.521
I think I'm goin to have
to pass on that one.

- Oh. and Chloe.

tone down the makeup.

255

and. uh. remove the fake tattoo.

- [Little Chloe] "Now
I lay me down to sleep.

I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

know what to pray for

279

because the thing that I
want the most is impossible.

280

pray. how do you pray?

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.746
Are there like rules?

282

And like certain
ways of doing it?

I don't know. maybe
we're doing it wrong.

- Well. when I was a kid.

286

in my neighborhood was
getting new bicycles.

287
00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.718
and so um. my birthday
was coming up.

288
00:14:09.805 --> 00:14:11.502
and I went to go
visit my grandma

289
00:14:11.589 --> 00:14:12.939
and whenever I went
to go visit her.

290
00:14:13.026 --> 00:14:15.898
she would always make me
go to church with her.

291
00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:17.900
And I distinctly
remember one Sunday.

292
00:14:17.987 --> 00:14:21.686
the preacher said. "Ask
and it shall be given."

293
00:14:21.773 --> 00:14:25.386
So right then and there I
prayed that if God was real.

294
00:14:25.473 --> 00:14:28.215
I would get a new bicycle for
my birthday. preferably red.

295
00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:29.129
- Of course.

296
00:14:29.216 --> 00:14:30.478
- So I thought to myself.

297
00:14:30.565 --> 00:14:33.176
well. you know.
if I pray for this

298
00:14:33.263 --> 00:14:36.049
and it comes true. that
means that God is real.

299
00:14:36.136 --> 00:14:38.486
and then. on top of it.
I'll get a new bicycle.

is not Santa Clause. right?

00:14:57.157 --> 00:14:58.506

awesome of a drummer

give what you want.

you what you need.

351
00:17:38.231 --> 00:17:41.277
[indistinct chatter]

352
00:17:44.585 --> 00:17:46.978
- [Joy] Chloe. it's so
nice to see you in a dress.

353
00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.284
- Muffin Lady.

354
00:17:48.371 --> 00:17:50.199
- Yes. did you
enjoy the muffins?

355
00:17:50.286 --> 00:17:52.897
- Yes. most definitely
the most delicious muffins

356
00:17:52.984 --> 00:17:53.942
Ive had. no doubt.

357
00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:56.075
- Well thank you. thank you.

358
00:17:56.162 --> 00:17:59.339
And Chloe. I'm going to hook
you up with my nephew Jamie.

359
00:17:59.426 --> 00:18:01.297
- [Grandma Sharon] Oh. Miss Joy.

360
00:18:01.384 --> 00:18:04.735
I would love for you
to meet some friends.

361
00:18:04.822 --> 00:18:05.954
- Lucky. I can't believe you.

362
00:18:06.041 --> 00:18:07.434
- What?

363
00:18:07.521 --> 00:18:08.913
- You know that you
don't lie in church.

364
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.787
You realize. you are a
sinner in church. sinning.

365
00:18:12.874 --> 00:18:13.527
- What lie?

366
00:18:13.614 --> 00:18:14.963
I didn't lie.

367
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:15.833
- You just told her
that they were the best

368
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.226
muffins you ever had.

369
00:18:17.313 --> 00:18:19.272
We all know Chloe threw
them in the trash.

370
00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:21.448
- Ahh. yeah. you see.

371
00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:23.580
you know that Chloe
threw them in the trash.

372
00:18:23.667 --> 00:18:25.060
What you don't know
is that I saved them

373
00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:26.366
and they were delicious.

374
00:18:26.453 --> 00:18:27.149
[many laughing]
[Chloe And Sticks] Ewww!

375
00:18:27.236 --> 00:18:28.455
- That's nasty!

376
00:18:30.805 --> 00:18:33.503
- So speaking of new directions.

377
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.070
what are you gonna do now?

378
00:18:35.157 --> 00:18:36.941
We've never really talked
about your parents.

379
00:18:37.028 --> 00:18:38.639
the band. or anything.

380
00:18:38.726 --> 00:18:40.336
- I think right now. I'm
just going to lay low.

381
00:18:40.423 --> 00:18:41.903
Like. just for the summer.

382
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.124
because everything that I
knew kinda got up rooted.

383
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:47.430
And honestly. I'm just
trying to figure out

384
00:18:47.517 --> 00:18:49.476
who I am and where
I'm suppose to be.

385
00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:52.435
- Chloe. I'll tell you
exactly who you are.

386
00:18:52.522 --> 00:18:54.220
You're the best friend
that I've ever had.

387
00:18:54.307 --> 00:18:55.917
You're a reason we are a band.

388
00:18:56.004 --> 00:18:57.397
I'm gonna miss you so much.

389
00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.139
What are you gonna do if
we make it into Band Clash?

390
00:19:00.226 --> 00:19:01.531
- [Lucky] Yeah.

391
00:19:01.618 --> 00:19:03.098
- You guys will
find somebody else.

392
00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:04.969
You guys are the real
talent. I mean. I do nothing.

393
00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:06.710
- No you know that's not true.

394
00:19:06.797 --> 00:19:07.668
And now we have to
listen to Lucky sing.

395
00:19:07.755 --> 00:19:09.060
- Yes!

396
00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:10.627
Now. my star
qualities will shine.

397
00:19:10.714 --> 00:19:11.541
- Oh. great!

398
00:19:11.628 --> 00:19:13.152
- Guys. it's 4 hours away.

399
00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:15.241
I didn't move to New York
or anything like that. okay?

400
00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:16.372
[footsteps approaching]

401
00:19:16.459 --> 00:19:18.940
- You kids are welcome anytime.

402
00:19:19.027 --> 00:19:20.898
Just give me a little heads up.

403
00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:22.683
so I can stock up on supplies.

404
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.075
[many laughing]

405
00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:27.035
Besides. if Chloe
decides to go to college.

406
00:19:27.122 --> 00:19:28.950
she'll only be an hour away.

407
00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:30.299
- [Chloe] What?

408
00:19:30.386 --> 00:19:31.648
- [Sticks. Wrench.
Lucky] College?

409
00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:32.606
- [Lucky] You're
going to college?

410
00:19:32.693 --> 00:19:33.781
- We'll talk about it later.

411
00:19:33.868 --> 00:19:35.609
We really need to skedaddle.

412
00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:36.958
- [Sticks] Bye. grandma.

413
00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:37.828
- [Grandma Sharon]
Bye. sweetheart.

414
00:19:39.569 --> 00:19:42.006
[many giggles]

415
00:19:44.139 --> 00:19:45.488
- You know. I like your friends.

416
00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:47.360
- [Chloe] Thanks grandma.

417
00:19:47.447 --> 00:19:48.796
- [Sticks] All
right. let's go boys.

418
00:19:48.883 --> 00:19:50.101
- Do I get to drive this time?

419
00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:51.364
- [Wrench] Nope.

420
00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:54.889
[car engine roaring]

421
00:19:54.976 --> 00:19:58.197
[soft music]

422
00:19:58.284 --> 00:20:03.332
- Grandma. what did
you mean when you said

423
00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.596
that we need to
talk about college?

424
00:20:06.683 --> 00:20:08.163
I've never applied anywhere.

425
00:20:09.425 --> 00:20:11.558
- I know you didn't. but I did.

426
00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:12.428
- What?

427
00:20:12.515 --> 00:20:14.038
Where did you apply?

428
00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:16.780
- CCU. the same place
your parents went to.

429
00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:20.219
- Grandma. I'm not going there.

430
00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:22.438
I not CCU material.

431
00:20:22.525 --> 00:20:24.440
- You are so CCU material.

432
00:20:25.615 --> 00:20:28.139
You are perfect CCU material.

433
00:20:29.706 --> 00:20:30.577
- Oh my gosh.

434
00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:34.145
What did we just hit?

435
00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.930
- Lunch. it was a turkey.

436
00:20:38.411 --> 00:20:40.239
Lunch. I'll go back
and get it later.

437
00:20:42.153 --> 00:20:45.244
[car engine roaring]

438
00:20:49.291 --> 00:20:50.205
[car door bangs]

439
00:20:50.292 --> 00:20:52.163
Chloe. you may be mad at me.

440
00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:53.904
but that does not
give you the right

441
00:20:53.991 --> 00:20:56.037
to take it out on
old Frankie here.

442
00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:57.125
You come back here

443
00:20:57.212 --> 00:20:59.258
and you shut this door properly.

444
00:21:10.051 --> 00:21:12.140
[car door closes]

445
00:21:12.227 --> 00:21:14.925
And I was just kidding
about that turkey.

446
00:21:17.928 --> 00:21:22.977
- [sighs] Oh. Lord. when
they say the best part

447
00:21:24.108 --> 00:21:27.590
of parenting was
being a grandparent.

448
00:21:27.677 --> 00:21:29.157
[door bangs]

449
00:21:29.244 --> 00:21:31.638
I don't think they
had this in mind.

450
00:21:34.205 --> 00:21:38.949
Please give me a little more
time and patience. Amen.

451
00:21:42.518 --> 00:21:43.258
[soft music]

452
00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:45.956
[birds chirping]

453

[grandma humming]

454
00:21:50.918 --> 00:21:51.614
There you are.

455
00:21:51.701 --> 00:21:53.137
- [Chloe] Hello.

456
00:21:53.224 --> 00:21:54.443
- I was just fixing
to go check up on you.

457
00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.619
How are you feeling?

458
00:21:56.706 --> 00:21:58.229
- I'm tired. it's hot.

459
00:21:58.317 --> 00:21:59.970
It makes me sleepy.

460
00:22:00.057 --> 00:22:03.104
- You know. I made
some fresh ice tea.

461
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:05.149
So. if you wanna cool down.

462
00:22:05.236 --> 00:22:07.282
maybe you could go
get yourself some.

463
00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:08.805
- [Chloe] I'm gonna go do that.

464
00:22:08.892 --> 00:22:09.806
Do you want any?

465
00:22:09.893 --> 00:22:11.112
- I'm good. I have some water.

466
00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:12.592
But I was wondering.

467
00:22:12.679 --> 00:22:15.029
would you mind reading
to me when you get back.

468
00:22:17.161 --> 00:22:18.554
- [Chloe] Reading what?

469
00:22:18.641 --> 00:22:20.513
- My Bible's in
there on the counter.

470
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.297
Would you pick it
up on your way back?

471
00:22:22.384 --> 00:22:23.429
- [Chloe] Hmm Hmm!

472
00:22:23.516 --> 00:22:24.473
- Thank you darling!

473
00:22:25.866 --> 00:22:29.391
- "James. a bond servant of God

474
00:22:29.478 --> 00:22:31.262
and of the Lord Jesus Christ.

475
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.527
to the twelve tribes who
are dispersed abroad.

476
00:22:34.614 --> 00:22:39.619
Greetings. consider it
pure joy. my brothers.

477
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.232
when you encounter
trials of many kinds.

478
00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:48.497
knowing that the testing of
your faith produces endurance.

479
00:22:51.065 --> 00:22:53.850
And let the endurance
have it's perfect result

480
00:22:53.937 --> 00:22:57.941
that you may be mature and
complete. lacking in nothing."

481
00:22:59.334 --> 00:23:01.684
[soft music]

482
00:23:04.252 --> 00:23:05.645
- Chloe. what's the matter?

483
00:23:09.866 --> 00:23:13.914
- He says to count it pure
joy when you face trials.

484
00:23:14.001 --> 00:23:15.306
- Yes.

485
00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.264
- Is he...

486
00:23:18.266 --> 00:23:20.311
Is he nuts or am I just stupid?

487
00:23:21.487 --> 00:23:23.619
No. just listen grandma. okay?

488
00:23:27.318 --> 00:23:31.192
You say God has a plan
for everything. right?

489
00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:32.411
- [Grandma Sharon] Yes.

490
00:23:34.282 --> 00:23:38.678
- Okay. tell me exactly how
taking my parents away from me

491
00:23:38.765 --> 00:23:40.244
works out in His great plan.

492
00:23:43.857 --> 00:23:48.818
I have asked myself
over and over. why.

493
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.605
- Baby. right now you
are just going through

494
00:23:52.692 --> 00:23:54.302
one of those mountains in life.

495
00:23:54.389 --> 00:23:55.738
We all have them.

496
00:23:58.045 --> 00:24:01.222
I faced some of my
toughest mountains myself.

497
00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:03.006
when my folks past away.

498
00:24:05.226 --> 00:24:07.358
and when your
granddaddy past away.

499
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.537
And your mamma and daddy.

500
00:24:13.582 --> 00:24:17.020
And poor ole Biscuit his
been moping around here

501
00:24:17.107 --> 00:24:18.805
ever since Gravy past on.

502
00:24:21.372 --> 00:24:24.332
Mountains are also hard
decisions we have to make.

503
00:24:25.855 --> 00:24:27.640
But baby. God can give
you the strength to climb

504
00:24:27.727 --> 00:24:31.208
that mountain or
you can just let it

505
00:24:31.295 --> 00:24:32.862
stop you in your tracks.

506
00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:38.128
That choice will
always be yours.

507
00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:43.307
But I know in my heart you
will make the right decision.

508
00:24:47.529 --> 00:24:50.227
[Chloe crying]

509
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.537
It's okay. it's gonna be okay.

510
00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.281
You know. how about later today

511
00:25:01.456 --> 00:25:03.850
we go down to your secret garden

512
00:25:03.937 --> 00:25:05.634
and we fix ourselves a picnic.

513
00:25:06.461 --> 00:25:11.379
[soft music]
[Biscuit huffing]

514
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.343
These are just for you Biscuit.

515
00:25:22.477 --> 00:25:25.872
- Hey grandma. do you
still think about Grandpa?

516
00:25:27.047 --> 00:25:29.049
- Oh goodness. I think
about him everyday.

517
00:25:30.572 --> 00:25:32.618
[soft music]
[birds chirping]

518
00:25:32.705 --> 00:25:36.012
- But with time. the
pain it fades away

519
00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.973
but the memories of the
things he used to do.

520
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.409
[water splashing]

521
00:25:41.496 --> 00:25:45.152
oh. my goodness. [laughs]
those make me smile.

522
00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:48.547
[soft music]

523
00:25:50.418 --> 00:25:52.420
- I don't think I'm
ever get to that point.

524
00:25:53.856 --> 00:25:55.336
The memories that I do have.

525
00:25:56.903 --> 00:25:58.513
It's been a long time.

526
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.039
It's kind of stupid. but.
well. I still feel broken

527
00:26:06.434 --> 00:26:09.219
- Let me tell you
a story [chuckles]

528
00:26:09.306 --> 00:26:11.700
and it's not from the Bible.

529
00:26:11.787 --> 00:26:14.311
[soft music]

530
00:26:18.228 --> 00:26:22.276
Once. there was a water
bearer who had two large pots.

531
00:26:22.363 --> 00:26:24.713
Each pot hung on
the end of a pole.

532
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.410
which he carried
across his neck.

533
00:26:28.064 --> 00:26:32.852
Everyday he would walk from
the stream to his house.

534
00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:35.637
Now one pot was perfect.

535
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.467
and the other pot was cracked.

536
00:26:41.077 --> 00:26:45.821
So everyday as he went from
the stream to his house.

537
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.390
the cracked pot leaked
all the way up there.

538
00:26:50.565 --> 00:26:53.699
Of course the perfect
pot was proud of itself

539
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:57.267
but the poor cracked
pot felt ashamed.

540
00:26:57.354 --> 00:26:59.008
miserable. and even angry.

541
00:27:00.706 --> 00:27:04.448
After years of feeling
like a bitter failure.

542
00:27:04.535 --> 00:27:06.494
it finally spoke to
the water bearer.

543
00:27:08.322 --> 00:27:11.064
"I am cracked and broken.

544
00:27:11.151 --> 00:27:12.935
I'm useless and miserable".

545
00:27:14.067 --> 00:27:15.372
The bearer said to the pot.

546
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.899
"Did you notice the flowers
on your side of the path.

547
00:27:19.986 --> 00:27:21.683
but not on the other side?

548
00:27:22.858 --> 00:27:26.209
That's because I have always
known about your flaw.

549
00:27:26.296 --> 00:27:29.778
and I planted flower
seeds on your side.

550
00:27:29.865 --> 00:27:33.173
So every day as we walk from
the stream to the house.

551
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.436
you've watered those flowers.

552
00:27:35.523 --> 00:27:39.570
Now I have beautiful flowers
to decorate to grace my house."

553
00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.835
We are all cracked.

554
00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:44.663
but God's like the water bearer.

555
00:27:45.925 --> 00:27:48.362
He knows what's going to happen

556
00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:51.278
and He prepares
us. if we let Him.

557
00:27:52.453 --> 00:27:53.541
- So what?

558
00:27:53.628 --> 00:27:54.498

[car engine roaring]

704
00:35:08.193 --> 00:35:10.020
- Chloe. good to see you.

705
00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:11.370
- [Chloe] Hey!

706
00:35:11.457 --> 00:35:13.328
[car door bangs]

707
00:35:13.415 --> 00:35:16.157
- Hey there. Biscuit.
how you doing buddy?

708
00:35:17.854 --> 00:35:20.988
- Thank you for taking care
of Biscuit while I'm gone.

709
00:35:21.075 --> 00:35:25.079
He's been kind of um depressed
since. since Grandma died.

710
00:35:25.166 --> 00:35:26.733
I surely appreciate it.

711
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.301
- It's no problem.
he's a good dog.

712
00:35:29.388 --> 00:35:32.391
And besides. my wife would
love somebody to dote on

713
00:35:32.478 --> 00:35:34.828
since the kids have
all moved out now.

714
00:35:34.915 --> 00:35:36.264
Hey. speaking of my wife.

715
00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:38.179
she makes a mean lemonade.
would you like some?

716
00:35:38.266 --> 00:35:38.962
- Yeah.

717
00:35:39.049 --> 00:35:40.094
- Alright.

718
00:35:42.575 --> 00:35:44.316
- So Chloe. how ya doing?

719
00:35:44.403 --> 00:35:47.057
Are you anxious or excited
about starting school?

720
00:35:48.842 --> 00:35:53.803
- Um. well. actually. I don't
think I'm gonna fit in there.

721
00:35:56.763 --> 00:36:00.158
- God has a special purpose
and a plan for you. Chloe.

722
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.161
- What is it?

723
00:36:04.205 --> 00:36:06.251
- That's for you to find out.

724
00:36:06.338 --> 00:36:08.818
[Rock music]

725
00:36:33.147 --> 00:36:35.932
[car door bangs]

726
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:41.590
- Hey. what's up?

727
00:36:43.244 --> 00:36:45.028
- Hi. may I help
you with something?

728
00:36:45.115 --> 00:36:49.032
- Uh. I think her name
is. uh. Ms. Bethel.

729
00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:50.686
- It's Mrs. Bethel.

730
00:36:50.773 --> 00:36:51.470
You must be Chloe.

731
00:36:51.557 --> 00:36:52.558
- Uh uh.

732
00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:53.472
- Hi

733
00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:54.821
So. I need to let you know

734
00:36:54.908 --> 00:36:56.736
we have a 10pm
curfew on weekdays.

735
00:36:56.823 --> 00:36:58.694
a midnight curfew on Fridays

736
00:36:58.781 --> 00:37:00.479
and 11pm on Saturdays.

737
00:37:00.566 --> 00:37:03.569
- Wait. okay. by curfew.
though. you mean. like.

738
00:37:03.656 --> 00:37:05.223
like on the campus by that hour?

739
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.181
- No. I mean you need
to be in your room.

740
00:37:07.268 --> 00:37:09.227
And if you're late.
that's a demerit.

741
00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:10.967
- How many demerits
can I get again?

742
00:37:11.054 --> 00:37:12.534
- 24.

743
00:37:12.621 --> 00:37:15.145
Perhaps you should read
your handbook at page 24.

744
00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:17.496
that's the demerit section.

745
00:37:17.583 --> 00:37:19.498
Oh. we also have Chapel
Monday through Friday.

746
00:37:19.585 --> 00:37:21.064
- I think I'll pass.

747
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:23.197
I'll probably be busy
studying or something. right?

748
00:37:23.284 --> 00:37:25.025
- It's at 8:00am.

749
00:37:25.112 --> 00:37:27.332
and it's mandatory
for all students.

750
00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:28.811
Let's go see the campus.

751
00:37:30.073 --> 00:37:32.119
[soft music]

752
00:37:32.206 --> 00:37:32.989
- Oh. Good Morning. Mrs. Johnson

753
00:37:33.076 --> 00:37:34.687
- Ms. Bethel.

754
00:37:34.774 --> 00:37:36.079
- I'd like you to meet Chloe.

755
00:37:36.166 --> 00:37:39.561
She will be rooming
here. room 326.

756
00:37:39.648 --> 00:37:41.955
Chloe. Mrs. Johnson
is your dorm mother.

757
00:37:42.042 --> 00:37:43.086
- Nice to meet you Chloe.

758
00:37:45.045 --> 00:37:46.829
Just mind the rules in this book

759
00:37:46.916 --> 00:37:47.830
and you'll be fine.

760
00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.314
You know. a lot of kids
think they can get away

761
00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:54.228
with stuff with me.

762
00:37:54.315 --> 00:37:56.665
but I was young once too.

763
00:37:58.711 --> 00:38:00.756
- Mommy. is that a zombie?

764
00:38:00.843 --> 00:38:02.236
- Sh sh sh.

765
00:38:02.323 --> 00:38:04.020
- Okay. Chloe. so
over here to our left

766
00:38:04.107 --> 00:38:05.761
we have our tennis courts.

767
00:38:05.848 --> 00:38:08.111
and just to the right
of that is our chapel.

768
00:38:08.198 --> 00:38:09.374
That's where they have
our chapel services

769
00:38:09.461 --> 00:38:10.984
I was talking about earlier.

770
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:12.507
Hello?

771
00:38:12.594 --> 00:38:14.509
Okay and then just
back beyond our chapel

772
00:38:14.596 --> 00:38:15.597
we have our auditorium.

773
00:38:15.684 --> 00:38:17.512
Well. are you excited?

774
00:38:18.557 --> 00:38:20.210
- Yeah. sure.

775
00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:22.169
- Let's go inside and
go up to your room.

776
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.042
Welcome to your new home.

777
00:38:27.957 --> 00:38:28.697
After you.

778
00:38:30.264 --> 00:38:32.135
Your on the third floor.

779
00:38:32.222 --> 00:38:34.050
Well. the elevator is broken.

780
00:38:34.137 --> 00:38:35.138
It breaks down a lot.

781
00:38:35.225 --> 00:38:36.314
This building is old.

782
00:38:45.105 --> 00:38:49.936
[playful music]
[both panting]

783
00:38:51.024 --> 00:38:51.894
- Just think what great
shape you'll be in

784
00:38:51.981 --> 00:38:52.634
by the end of the year.

785
00:38:59.162 --> 00:39:01.426
Here we are. 326.

786
00:39:01.513 --> 00:39:03.297
[door knocks]

787
00:39:03.384 --> 00:39:05.691
Your roommate might
already be here.

788
00:39:05.778 --> 00:39:07.475
[door squeaks]

789
00:39:07.562 --> 00:39:10.260
- Hi. Mrs. Bethel.
what brings you here?

790
00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:12.872
- Hi. Maddy. I'd like you to
meet your new roommate. Chloe.

791
00:39:12.959 --> 00:39:13.742
- Hi.

792
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:20.619
- I've got your
schedule right here.

793
00:39:20.706 --> 00:39:23.491
Don't worry you're
in good hands.

794
00:39:24.666 --> 00:39:26.581
I've got to get
back to the office.

795
00:39:26.668 --> 00:39:29.279
Chloe. don't hesitate to
call me if you need anything.

796
00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.325
- Okay. bye.

797
00:39:31.412 --> 00:39:32.979
- [Mrs. Bethel] Bye.

798
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.464
- I can help you decorate
your side if you want.

799
00:39:39.551 --> 00:39:43.076
- Uh. no. I'm kind of
a minimalist. I'm good.

800
00:39:43.163 --> 00:39:44.860
- Well. I can help you unpack

801
00:39:44.947 --> 00:39:47.428
and then we can
go get your books.

802
00:39:47.515 --> 00:39:49.169
- All my stuff is in the truck.

803
00:39:52.346 --> 00:39:54.000
- Okay. well. let's go!

804
00:39:55.958 --> 00:39:59.266
[playful music]

805
00:39:59.353 --> 00:40:01.094
[footsteps approaching]

806
00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:02.443
Oh. Let me see your schedule.

807
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:08.231
Math. English. Home
& Family. [laughs]

808
00:40:08.318 --> 00:40:09.929
Mr. Peters in Home and Family

809
00:40:10.016 --> 00:40:13.019
requires that you
memorize 100 Bible verses

810
00:40:13.106 --> 00:40:15.891
and quote them by the
end of the semester.

811
00:40:15.978 --> 00:40:16.675
- What!

812
00:40:16.762 --> 00:40:17.458
A hundred verses?

813
00:40:17.545 --> 00:40:19.417
- I know. right?

814
00:40:19.504 --> 00:40:21.680
However. for every
date you go on.

815
00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:24.378
with a different
person. he waives 10!

816
00:40:24.465 --> 00:40:27.903
So. if you date 10 boys. you
don't have to memorize any!

817
00:40:29.514 --> 00:40:31.298
- Do they have to
go to this school?

818
00:40:31.385 --> 00:40:34.257
- I don't know. that's
a really good question.

819
00:40:34.344 --> 00:40:36.346
Anyways. I wish all
my teachers did that.

820
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:38.261
We could just date all semester

821
00:40:38.348 --> 00:40:39.567
and have no homework!

822
00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:45.443
Oh. look. no. don't look.
over there is Josh Miller.

823
00:40:46.487 --> 00:40:47.923
Isn't he adorable!

824
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:49.925
He would definitely
be one of my ten.

825
00:40:50.012 --> 00:40:50.752
Come on.

826
00:40:53.538 --> 00:40:56.192
You know we do have
a dress code here.

827
00:40:56.279 --> 00:40:58.281
- Yep. I've been told.

828
00:40:58.368 --> 00:41:00.283
- I'll be happy to give
you a wardrobe check.

829
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:02.242
After we get your books
we can unpack your car

830
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:03.548
and put your stuff away.

831
00:41:05.941 --> 00:41:09.249
Oh dear. we don't have
one single class together!

832
00:41:10.293 --> 00:41:11.120
- That's a shame.

833
00:41:12.948 --> 00:41:15.211
[door opens]

834
00:41:15.298 --> 00:41:16.735
- Mrs. Cooper is the best.

835
00:41:16.822 --> 00:41:19.259
And you'll just love her
granddaughter. Nechelle.

836
00:41:19.346 --> 00:41:20.869
[footsteps approaching]

837
00:41:20.956 --> 00:41:22.523
Good Morning. Mrs. Cooper.

838
00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:23.959
- Hi.

839
00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:25.961
- I'd like you to meet
my new roommate. Chloe.

840
00:41:26.048 --> 00:41:27.572
- Welcome. Chloe.

841
00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:29.356
Why don't you let me take
a look at your schedule.

842
00:41:30.749 --> 00:41:33.534
- Ooh. there's
Megan and Jennifer.

843
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:35.014
I'll be right back.

844
00:41:37.756 --> 00:41:39.105
[Chloe sighs]

845
00:41:39.192 --> 00:41:41.063
- If we could harness
the energy of that one.

846
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.065
we'd solve the world's
energy problem.

847
00:41:43.152 --> 00:41:44.676
- No kidding.

848
00:41:44.763 --> 00:41:47.766
- So some of your books
won't be here till tomorrow.

849
00:41:47.853 --> 00:41:51.770
Um. Nechelle. can you help
Chloe here with her books?

850
00:41:51.857 --> 00:41:52.640
This is my daughter. Nechelle.

851
00:41:52.727 --> 00:41:54.468
Nechelle. this is Chloe.

852
00:41:54.555 --> 00:41:56.862
- Hi. Chloe. welcome to CCU.

853
00:41:56.949 --> 00:41:57.645
- Thanks.

854
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.387
- So. I see you've met Maddy.

855
00:42:00.474 --> 00:42:02.345
- Yeah. roommate.

856
00:42:02.432 --> 00:42:04.739
- She's very nice. [chuckles]

857
00:42:04.826 --> 00:42:06.480
She talks pretty fast and a lot

858
00:42:06.567 --> 00:42:08.177
but you could do much worse.

859
00:42:08.264 --> 00:42:09.309
[both laughing]

860
00:42:09.396 --> 00:42:12.051
So. where are you from?

861
00:42:12.138 --> 00:42:14.270
- Um. well. if you look
on a map where there is.

862
00:42:14.357 --> 00:42:16.490
like. little to no civilization

863
00:42:16.577 --> 00:42:19.232
and I'm smack dab in
the middle of that.

864
00:42:19.319 --> 00:42:20.886
- [laughs] I know how you feel.

865
00:42:20.973 --> 00:42:23.279
I'm from a small
village in Sierra Leone.

866
00:42:23.366 --> 00:42:24.237
- What?

867
00:42:24.324 --> 00:42:25.717
How did you end up here?

868
00:42:25.804 --> 00:42:28.720
- Short story. my parents
died when I was young.

869
00:42:28.807 --> 00:42:31.113
And then when I was six. I
was adopted by missionaries.

870
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.550
but they died too.

871
00:42:32.637 --> 00:42:34.552
I've been living with
Miss Cooper ever since.

872
00:42:36.336 --> 00:42:37.598
- I'm sorry about that.

873
00:42:37.685 --> 00:42:40.383
- Oh. you don't
need to be sorry.

874
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:42.385
Living with Miss
Cooper is a blessing.

875
00:42:43.517 --> 00:42:47.477
She's my rock. actually.
she's a lot of kids'.

876
00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:50.437
You could consider
her a campus mom.

877
00:42:51.394 --> 00:42:52.395
You know what?

878

00:58:22.455 --> 00:58:25.284
CCU is hosting this year's
Songfest Fellowship Competition!

1232
00:58:25.371 --> 00:58:27.329
- And. as you know. they
are having open auditions.

1233
00:58:27.416 --> 00:58:28.330
anyone can enter.

1234
00:58:28.417 --> 00:58:30.463
- So. I entered us.

1235
00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:31.203
- Who?

1236
00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:32.073
- Wait. Who?

1237
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.858
- Us. the Misfits.

1238
00:58:33.945 --> 00:58:34.815
- I thought that was a joke!

1239
00:58:34.902 --> 00:58:36.295
- When is the competition?

1240
00:58:36.382 --> 00:58:38.340
- It's near the end
of the school year.

1241
00:58:38.427 --> 00:58:39.777
- Come on. it will be fun.

1242
00:58:39.864 --> 00:58:41.692
We will kick their butts!

1243
00:58:41.779 --> 00:58:43.476
- Just what everyone in a
Christian Singing Competition

1244
00:58:43.563 --> 00:58:45.130
aspires to do.

1245
00:58:45.217 --> 00:58:48.307
- Okay. we'll cal citrate
their gluteus maximuses.

1246
00:58:48.394 --> 00:58:49.482
- Yeah!

1247
00:58:49.569 --> 00:58:51.353
What he said.

1248
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:55.488
- Come on. it will keep me
out of trouble. mostly. maybe.

1249
00:58:57.534 --> 00:58:59.666
We can practice on the weekends.

1250
00:58:59.753 --> 00:59:02.539
- Don't look at me. I'm not
doing it if she's not doing it.

1251
00:59:03.801 --> 00:59:06.412
- Okay. I'm in.

1252
00:59:06.499 --> 00:59:07.544
- [Joshua And Caleb] Yes!

1253
00:59:08.501 --> 00:59:11.809
[Caleb and Joshua humming]

1254
00:59:11.896 --> 00:59:13.288
- Okay. if I were
you guys I would keep

1255
00:59:13.375 --> 00:59:15.421
that swinging
action to a minimum.

1256
00:59:15.508 --> 00:59:16.335
I'm pretty sure they
give out demerits

1257
00:59:16.422 --> 00:59:17.379
for that kind of thing.

1258
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:24.996
- We need something that no
one has ever done before.

1259
00:59:25.083 --> 00:59:26.954
- Something different.

1260
00:59:28.608 --> 00:59:30.567
- [chuckles] That's
what I just said.

1261
00:59:30.654 --> 00:59:33.787
- Something simple.
yet powerful.

1262
00:59:33.874 --> 00:59:36.660
- Okay. well. whenever
I'm trying write a song

1263
00:59:36.747 --> 00:59:40.489
I usually just write
down everything that
I'm trying to say.

1264
00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:41.621
and all the words
that pop into my head.

1265
00:59:41.708 --> 00:59:42.535
- You write songs?

1266
00:59:42.622 --> 00:59:43.971
- I've written a few.

1267
00:59:44.058 --> 00:59:45.320
I wrote most of the
songs for my band.

1268
00:59:45.407 --> 00:59:47.148
- You have a band? [chuckles]

1269
00:59:47.235 --> 00:59:48.672
- Yeah. [giggles]

1270
00:59:48.759 --> 00:59:51.631
- I vote that Chloe write
the song. all in favor?

1271
00:59:53.981 --> 00:59:56.418
- No. [giggles]

1272
00:59:56.505 --> 01:00:01.380
[sighs] Okay. well. um. what
are we gonna write about?

1273
01:00:01.467 --> 01:00:03.948
- Oh. I know. Jesus.

1274
01:00:04.035 --> 01:00:05.863
- Okay. what about Him?

1275
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:07.604
I need some input.

1276
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:11.042
[phone rings]

1277
01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:13.784
Hang on guys. I've
got to take this.

1278
01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:15.437
I'll be right back.

1279
01:00:15.524 --> 01:00:17.526
[footsteps departing]

1280
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.485
- So. what about Jesus?

1281
01:00:20.573 --> 01:00:22.401
- I love Him. [laughs]

1282
01:00:22.488 --> 01:00:26.492
- Hello. Sticks. hey. [giggles]

1283
01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:31.671
Yeah. what. what? [giggles]

1284
01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:33.455
No way!

1285
01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:36.502
Oh. my gosh. yes. yes.
yes. yes. I will be there.

1286
01:00:38.286 --> 01:00:42.377
Don't worry. I my fingers
limber. I remember everything.

1287
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.817
Okay. oh my gosh. I'm
so excited. [giggles]

1288
01:00:46.904 --> 01:00:48.427
Alright. well. give Wrench a hug

1289
01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:50.821
and Lucky a smack on the
head for me. would you?

1290
01:00:50.908 --> 01:00:51.648
Thank you.

1291
01:00:52.866 --> 01:00:54.302
All right. thanks for calling.

1292
01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:55.652
I'll see ya. [giggles] bye!

1293
01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:00.352
[laughs] Oh. that's good!

1294
01:01:00.439 --> 01:01:01.614
Um. that was Sticks.

1295
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:03.790
She's the drummer in the band.

1296
01:01:03.877 --> 01:01:04.617
- The Band?

1297
01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:06.227
- Yeah. the band.

1298
01:01:06.314 --> 01:01:09.578
Um. they just made finals
in a band competition

1299
01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.798
with a song that I wrote.

1300
01:01:11.885 --> 01:01:14.105
- [Caleb] Nice.
- Wow. congrats girl!

1301
01:01:14.192 --> 01:01:16.890
- I'm pretty pumped about it.

1302
01:01:16.977 --> 01:01:18.500
Um. I promised them though.

1303
01:01:18.587 --> 01:01:20.633
that if they had a
gig anywhere near here

1304
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.982
that I would play with them

1305
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:25.159
and the finals are
being held here.

1306
01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:26.073
- Sweet!

1307
01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.684
- I'm super excited.

1308
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:32.689
[giggles] Okay. um. well.
where were we. sorry?

1309
01:01:35.387 --> 01:01:36.170
- Jesus!

1310
01:01:38.085 --> 01:01:40.348
- Okay. what are we
going to write about him?

1311
01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:41.959
- Awesome.

1312
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.439
- Blessed.

1313
01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:47.529
- Compassionate.

1314
01:01:47.616 --> 01:01:48.617
- [Joshua] Deliverer.

1315
01:01:50.228 --> 01:01:52.839
- [chuckles] Awesome.
blessed. compassionate.

1316
01:01:54.058 --> 01:01:56.930
it's like the ABC's
of God guys. [laughs]

1317
01:01:58.018 --> 01:01:59.063
But. I don't know.

1318
01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.458
I just remember something
my grandma always told me.

1319
01:02:03.545 --> 01:02:06.635
That you can't label God.

1320
01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:10.552
You can't put God in a box.

1321
01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:14.513
That God is not this.

1322
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.906
and God is not that

1323
01:02:18.952 --> 01:02:22.564
but that He is so much
bigger than any label

1324
01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:25.872
that you can put on Him.

1325
01:02:27.047 --> 01:02:31.051
But. I don't know. I mean that's
just what my grandma said.

1326
01:02:31.138 --> 01:02:32.618
Whatever. it's stupid.

1327
01:02:34.663 --> 01:02:37.754
- Actually Chloe.
that's brilliant.

1328
01:02:39.538 --> 01:02:42.019
[guitar music]

1329
01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:48.634
- Ugh. why am I having such
a hard time with this song?

1330
01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:50.244
I've never had such a
mental block before.

1331
01:02:50.331 --> 01:02:52.507
I mean. usually the
words just come out

1332
01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:54.031
so easily. you know. ahhh.

1333
01:02:56.729 --> 01:02:59.514
- Well. maybe it's
because you're not
really invested in it.

1334
01:02:59.601 --> 01:03:00.602
- What? [laughs]

1335
01:03:00.689 --> 01:03:01.995
What's that suppose to mean?

1336
01:03:02.082 --> 01:03:03.910
I really wanna do this.

1337
01:03:03.997 --> 01:03:06.086
- I didn't mean to
imply that you didn't.

1338
01:03:06.173 --> 01:03:09.698
but when you write your
songs. are you inspired?

1339
01:03:10.699 --> 01:03:12.179
Where does it come from?

1340
01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:13.659
- I usually just think about

1341
01:03:13.746 --> 01:03:15.748
whatever it is that
I'm struggling with

1342
01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:17.663
or feel drawn to.

1343
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:20.100
and what it is I'm trying
to say about it. I guess.

1344
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:23.756
- I think you need some
good old fashioned input.

1345
01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:24.713
[both laughing]

1346
01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.193
- Input. come on. [giggles]

1347
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.673
You guys have given
me so much input.

1348
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.415
- I'm maxed out on
input right now. Okay?

1349
01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:35.463
- But. do you feel it.
understand it. believe it?

1350
01:03:39.728 --> 01:03:41.774
- Well. what do you suggest?

1351
01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.646
- Reading. [chuckles]

1352
01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:45.517
- What?

1353
01:03:46.692 --> 01:03:47.649
- The B I B L E.

1354
01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:50.261
[both laughing]

1355
01:03:50.348 --> 01:03:51.088
- What?

1356
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.832
- No. really. it's
what gets me through.

1357
01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:58.835
The Bible. I stand
alone on the Bible.

1358
01:04:00.053 --> 01:04:03.709
- [sighs] All right.
I've read the Bible.

1359
01:04:03.796 --> 01:04:05.189
plenty of times [giggling].

1360
01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:09.628
My grandma she used to
pretend that she couldn't see

1361
01:04:09.715 --> 01:04:11.369
well enough to read anymore

1362
01:04:11.456 --> 01:04:13.458
and would make me sit for hours

1363
01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:14.938
and try to just read it to her.

1364
01:04:15.025 --> 01:04:16.853
She was so sneaky.

1365
01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:21.379
- But did you read
it to understand it?

1366
01:04:21.466 --> 01:04:23.468
Or did you just read
it to please her?

1367
01:04:26.514 --> 01:04:28.386
No one can give you faith.

1368
01:04:28.473 --> 01:04:33.521
It's not something you just
feel. like most people think.

1369
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.873
You can only gain it by
hearing the Word of God.

1370
01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.443
- Yeah. I guess
I'll try it. again.

1371
01:04:44.576 --> 01:04:45.359
Where do I start?

1372
01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:49.320
- You start with Jesus' life.

1373
01:04:49.407 --> 01:04:50.495
Read the book of Matthew

1374
01:04:50.582 --> 01:04:52.584
and then read the book of Acts.

1375
01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:54.760
the first couple of chapters.

1376
01:04:54.847 --> 01:04:58.720
- Okay. I guess
I'll start tonight.

1377
01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:01.158
- Great! [chuckles]

1378
01:05:01.245 --> 01:05:02.942
- I do have one problem though.

1379
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.987
- What?

1380
01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:05.075
- I don't have a Bible. [laughs]

1381
01:05:05.162 --> 01:05:06.946
- Uh. that's not a problem.

1382
01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:10.384
Did I mention my mom
runs a bookstore?

1383
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:13.170
[both laughing]

1384
01:05:13.257 --> 01:05:16.913
- Okay. anyways. let's
just try this again.

1385
01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:26.966
♪ You gave me your love.
my life and my soul ♪

1386
01:05:28.837 --> 01:05:33.886
♪ I gave you my heart.
my mind and control ♪

1387
01:05:35.061 --> 01:05:37.107
- Chloe. you've been
reading for weeks.

1388
01:05:37.194 --> 01:05:38.325
What's going on?

1389
01:05:38.412 --> 01:05:39.805
- I don't know.

1390
01:05:39.892 --> 01:05:41.285
I mean. at first. I thought
it was pretty boring

1391
01:05:41.372 --> 01:05:44.941
and dry. and. I don't
know. now I just...

1392
01:05:46.986 --> 01:05:47.987
- Now you have questions?

1393
01:05:50.903 --> 01:05:55.647
- Why do we have
so many different
churches. and one Bible?

1394
01:05:56.909 --> 01:05:59.738
And why is it that we have
so many different religions

1395
01:05:59.825 --> 01:06:01.958
but just one book?

1396
01:06:02.045 --> 01:06:04.177
Isn't it
straightforward. or what?

1397
01:06:04.264 --> 01:06:06.092
- Well. it's kind
of like what my Dad

1398
01:06:06.179 --> 01:06:07.702
always used to tell me.

1399
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:10.270
People don't argue over what
the Bible actually says.

1400
01:06:10.357 --> 01:06:13.317
they argue over what they
think it says. [chuckles]

1401
01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:15.101
Most people don't read

- [Nechelle] Because you
needed some fresh air.

1746
01:23:39.318 --> 01:23:40.189
[blinds opening]

1747
01:23:40.276 --> 01:23:41.407
Rise and shine.

1748
01:23:41.494 --> 01:23:42.843
- Oh geez. uurrgh.

1749
01:23:44.323 --> 01:23:46.021
- [Nechelle] No
rest for the wicked.

1750
01:23:49.894 --> 01:23:51.460
- What happened?

1751
01:23:51.548 --> 01:23:53.941
- What happened was that you
pocket dialed me at 2 am.

1752
01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:56.553
Singing. rather loudly
and slightly off key.

1753
01:23:56.639 --> 01:23:58.598
might I add.
something about Jose.

1754
01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:03.386
- Geez. how did I get here?

1755
01:24:04.909 --> 01:24:06.519
- Well. I knew you
were at the club

1756
01:24:06.606 --> 01:24:08.826
and you weren't in any shape
to drive. so I called Josh.

1757
01:24:08.913 --> 01:24:10.262
- Josh knows?

1758
01:24:10.349 --> 01:24:11.219
- Would you have rather
I had called Caleb?

1759
01:24:11.307 --> 01:24:14.440
- No. no. no Josh is fine.

1760
01:24:14.527 --> 01:24:15.876
- So we went to the club

1761
01:24:15.963 --> 01:24:17.052
and brought you here.

1762
01:24:20.403 --> 01:24:21.925
- You must really
hate me right now.

1763
01:24:22.013 --> 01:24:23.318
- Getting wasted?

1764
01:24:23.406 --> 01:24:24.581
You could say I hate it.

1765
01:24:24.668 --> 01:24:25.843
You. I love.

1766
01:24:30.804 --> 01:24:34.852
- Oh. gosh. I do
not feel so good.

1767
01:24:34.939 --> 01:24:36.984
- Well. you've got two
minutes to get dressed

1768
01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:38.029
and then I'm sending mom in.

1769
01:24:38.116 --> 01:24:40.597
- What. wait. does she know?

1770
01:24:40.684 --> 01:24:42.251
- More than you know

1771
01:24:42.338 --> 01:24:43.730
but not about last night.

1772
01:24:44.905 --> 01:24:46.081
At least. I don't
think she does.

1773
01:24:47.952 --> 01:24:50.259
- Okay. I'll be right down.

1774
01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:58.005
- There's way too many stairs
in this place. [giggles]

1775
01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:00.921
Oh men. my head still really
hurts from last night.

1776
01:25:03.184 --> 01:25:05.187
You know. speaking
about last night.

1777
01:25:06.013 --> 01:25:07.972
thank you for covering for me.

1778
01:25:08.059 --> 01:25:10.757
- I wasn't covering for
you. I was protecting you.

1779
01:25:11.932 --> 01:25:12.933
Big difference.

1780
01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:14.413
To say I was covering for you

1781
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.371
it'd mean I was hiding
something for you

1782
01:25:17.416 --> 01:25:19.636
and I don't wanna do that.

1783
01:25:19.723 --> 01:25:22.900
You know sometimes when someone
first becomes a Christian.

1784
01:25:22.987 --> 01:25:24.902
they meet their
greatest challenges.

1785
01:25:26.077 --> 01:25:27.818
My dad used to call
them their mountains.

1786
01:25:28.993 --> 01:25:32.083
- Yeah. my grandma used
to say the same thing.

1787
01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:35.956
- Well. sometimes you
pass those challenges

1788
01:25:36.043 --> 01:25:37.436
and sometimes you fail.

1789
01:25:37.523 --> 01:25:39.046
If you pass. it
makes you stronger.

1790
01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:42.093
If you fail. just ask God
for forgiveness and move on.

1791
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.964
And stay away from those things

1792
01:25:44.050 --> 01:25:45.357
that cause you to mess up.

1793
01:25:45.443 --> 01:25:47.184
You know what I mean?

1794
01:25:47.272 --> 01:25:51.058
- Yeah. but. I really
messed up last night.

1795
01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:54.888
Like really. I mean I went
there with the best intentions.

1796
01:25:54.975 --> 01:25:57.500
I. you know. I just hadn't
seen them in a long time.

1797
01:25:57.587 --> 01:26:00.285
I felt that I owed
it to them. you know.

1798
01:26:00.371 --> 01:26:02.505
How. what do I do
about my old friends?

1799
01:26:02.592 --> 01:26:05.856
I'm not ready to just
never see them again.

1800
01:26:07.074 --> 01:26:09.164
We've been through
so much together.

1801
01:26:09.251 --> 01:26:10.295
They are my family.

1802
01:26:11.469 --> 01:26:13.298
- Well. you don't have
to stop seeing them.

1803
01:26:13.385 --> 01:26:15.387
You just need to plan ahead.

1804
01:26:15.474 --> 01:26:17.084
What can you do differently.

1805
01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:19.478
if you find yourself in a
situation like that again?

1806
01:26:19.565 --> 01:26:20.914
- Take you with me next time.

1807
01:26:21.001 --> 01:26:22.438
[both laughing]

1808
01:26:22.525 --> 01:26:24.309
- You can't depend
on anyone. but God.

1809
01:26:25.657 --> 01:26:28.400
Next time. pray before you go

1810
01:26:28.487 --> 01:26:30.315
and be prepared with an answer

1811
01:26:30.402 --> 01:26:32.273
just in case you find
yourself in a situation

1812
01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:34.145
that could change
your life forever.

1813
01:26:35.581 --> 01:26:37.061
You know. if the school would
found out about it this.

1814
01:26:37.148 --> 01:26:39.193
you probably would
have been expelled.

1815
01:26:42.153 --> 01:26:44.590
- Oh. man. I never really
thought about that.

1816
01:26:45.678 --> 01:26:46.809
I am so sorry.

1817
01:26:48.115 --> 01:26:50.335
- I'm not the one you
need to apologize to.

1818
01:26:51.858 --> 01:26:53.730
- Who do I need to
apologize to now?

1819
01:26:53.817 --> 01:26:55.558
- [giggles] God.

1820
01:27:00.084 --> 01:27:00.824
- Yeah.

1821
01:27:03.087 --> 01:27:05.437
- Well. let's go.

1822
01:27:05.523 --> 01:27:06.656
- Where are we going?

1823
01:27:06.743 --> 01:27:07.787
- Another lap.

1824
01:27:07.874 --> 01:27:09.746
[Chloe laughs]

1825
01:27:09.833 --> 01:27:11.008
- [Nechelle] Let's go.

1826
01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:13.228
Wait. you're serious.
uurrgg my gosh.

1827
01:27:17.144 --> 01:27:19.016
- So. how did the
competition go?

1828
01:27:19.103 --> 01:27:20.452
- We were practically
the best group there.

1829
01:27:20.539 --> 01:27:21.800
- Practically?

1830
01:27:21.888 --> 01:27:23.368
- Well we would
have been the best

1831
01:27:23.455 --> 01:27:25.892
if someone hadn't ditched
us for their old friends.

1832
01:27:25.978 --> 01:27:28.068
I won't mention
any names though.

1833
01:27:28.155 --> 01:27:31.071
- Only your graciousness
outshines your
subtleness. Caleb.

1834
01:27:31.157 --> 01:27:33.596
- Listen guys. I know it
feels like I ditched you

1835
01:27:33.683 --> 01:27:34.597
for my old friends.

1836
01:27:34.684 --> 01:27:35.902
but that's not what happened.

1837
01:27:37.164 --> 01:27:38.601
I'm sorry I did though.

1838
01:27:38.688 --> 01:27:41.081
and I'll make it up
to you guys next time.

1839
01:27:41.168 --> 01:27:43.954
- We know. because we
made it into the finals!

1840
01:27:44.041 --> 01:27:44.955
- [Many] What?

1841
01:27:45.041 --> 01:27:46.652
- Wait. how do you know?

1842
01:27:46.739 --> 01:27:48.263
- I thought they weren't
posting the results until 10:00?

1843
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:50.830
- Well. I swung by the office
to drop off some paperwork

1844
01:27:50.916 --> 01:27:53.224
and I heard the
Dean on the phone.

1845
01:27:53.311 --> 01:27:54.746
- This calls for a celebration!

1846
01:27:54.834 --> 01:27:56.227
[many laughing]

1847
01:27:56.314 --> 01:27:57.054
- Don't count your
chickens before they hatch.

1848
01:27:57.141 --> 01:27:58.447
- What?

1849
01:27:58.534 --> 01:28:00.231
- Caleb. [giggles]
it surprises me

1850
01:28:00.318 --> 01:28:02.277
you make the grades you do.

1851
01:28:02.364 --> 01:28:04.540
- I was just thinking a
little pie to celebrate

1852
01:28:04.627 --> 01:28:06.977
this great occasion
would be appropriate.

1853
01:28:07.064 --> 01:28:09.109
Although. chicken
sounds pretty good too!

1854
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:14.941
- Can I talk to you guys in
the other room for a minute.

1855
01:28:15.028 --> 01:28:17.379
[Chloe sighs]

1856
01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.166
I don't think I should be in
this competition with you guys.

1857
01:28:22.253 --> 01:28:22.732
- Why not?

1858
01:28:22.818 --> 01:28:24.473
- Why?

1859
01:28:24.559 --> 01:28:28.520
- I don't think I deserve it.
especially after last night.

1860
01:28:28.607 --> 01:28:32.785
- Listen Chloe. you did what
you did for the right reasons.

1861
01:28:32.871 --> 01:28:34.004
You may have not made
the best decisions

1862
01:28:34.091 --> 01:28:35.005
while you were there.

1863
01:28:35.092 --> 01:28:36.963
but I understand why you went.

1864
01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:39.791
- Joshua is right. you
can't let the decisions

1865
01:28:39.879 --> 01:28:41.446
of your past allow
you to not make

1866
01:28:41.532 --> 01:28:43.143
good decisions in your future.

1867
01:28:43.230 --> 01:28:45.885
We want you and we need you
so you're coming with us.

1868
01:28:47.583 --> 01:28:50.237
- [laughs]I'm so lucky to
have friends like you guys.

1869
01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:52.239
- Hey. what about me?

1870
01:28:53.197 --> 01:28:55.460
[many laughing]

1871
01:28:55.547 --> 01:28:57.809
- I wrote this song

you need anything else?

about this weekend.

She's probably gonna
be up all night

1909
01:31:05.938 --> 01:31:08.071
talking to me about it.

You both need your rest.

make sure she gets rest

she just doesn't know

01:31:16.079 --> 01:31:17.341
why she has limits.

1916
01:31:17.428 --> 01:31:19.038
- [laughs] I don't
think she knows

1917
01:31:19.125 --> 01:31:20.518
like the meaning of that word.

1918
01:31:23.173 --> 01:31:27.394
- Chloe. I need to tell you
something about Nechelle.

[Chloe crying]

1925
01:32:02.429 --> 01:32:05.868
- Nechelle was really
sick for a long time.

1926
01:32:07.565 --> 01:32:11.221
The doctors only gave her
six months. five years ago.

1927
01:32:13.092 --> 01:32:16.356
But. Nechelle and God.
they had another plan.

1928
01:32:17.923 --> 01:32:19.403
I remember Nechelle would pray

1929
01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:21.405
that before she left this earth.

1930
01:32:22.449 --> 01:32:24.669
that she could teach someone.

1931
01:32:24.755 --> 01:32:27.411
that she could bring
someone to Christ.

1932
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:32.068
You. Chloe are the
answer to her prayer.

1933
01:32:32.155 --> 01:32:36.115
She prayed for you for five
years before you two even met.

1934
01:32:37.813 --> 01:32:41.251
Can you see. from her
perspective. how this is a joy?

1935
01:32:41.338 --> 01:32:43.818
[Chloe crying]

1936
01:32:55.657 --> 01:32:57.572
- From dust we where made

1937
01:32:58.746 --> 01:33:01.663
and to dust we will return.

1938
01:33:03.316 --> 01:33:06.798
That's really what happens
in the simplest of terms.

1939
01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:09.627
but it doesn't tell
the whole story.

1940
01:33:11.281 --> 01:33:12.587
What happens to our spirit?

1941
01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:15.371
What happens next?

1942
01:33:15.459 --> 01:33:19.550
What happens to that
internal part of who we are?

Nechelle. I tell you what.

1944
01:33:24.468 --> 01:33:26.469
that it's not the end.

1945
01:33:26.557 --> 01:33:29.865
but rather. it's
a new beginning.

1946
01:33:29.952 --> 01:33:32.215
- Nechelle was the
sister I never had.

1947
01:33:32.302 --> 01:33:34.521
She was so full of life and joy.

1948
01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:37.960
And she had a way of spreading
that joy to everyone she met.

1949
01:33:38.047 --> 01:33:40.223
Even Old man Crabs would
smile when she walked by.

1951
01:33:41.833 --> 01:33:43.443
She was a light that
could not be hidden.

1952
01:33:45.054 --> 01:33:47.056
- She made you feel
as though everything

1953
01:33:47.143 --> 01:33:48.448
was gonna be alright.

1954
01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:51.147
They say faith can
move mountains.

1955
01:33:51.234 --> 01:33:54.237
I saw faith in Nechelle like
those written in the Bible.

1956
01:33:55.151 --> 01:33:57.066
She judged no one.

1957
01:33:57.153 --> 01:33:59.764
But. what most of
you don't know is.

1958
01:33:59.851 --> 01:34:01.723
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for Nechelle.

1959
01:34:03.246 --> 01:34:04.639
She saved me from myself.

1960
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:13.865
- Um. I brought some papers

1961
01:34:13.952 --> 01:34:17.216
just so I wouldn't totally
loose my train of thought.

1962

asked me to speak.

1964
01:34:25.964 --> 01:34:30.795
Um. I was speechless.
and upset. and confused.

1965
01:34:37.584 --> 01:34:40.457
And then I thought about what
Nechelle would have said.

1966
01:34:40.544 --> 01:34:42.241
would have wanted me to do.

1967
01:34:42.327 --> 01:34:47.202
And so. I prayed and "gave it
to God" like she always said.

1968
01:34:49.771 --> 01:34:53.731
Um. [sighs] I know that she
wouldn't want us to be sad.

1969
01:35:00.999 --> 01:35:04.437
but be thankful for the
time that we had together.

1970
01:35:08.659 --> 01:35:12.184
And that these tears would
not be tears of sadness.

1971
01:35:12.271 --> 01:35:15.318
but of joy for
knowing each other.

2086
01:41:31.607 --> 01:41:33.043
[both laughing]

2087
01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:34.784
- Let me put these
in a bag for you.

2088
01:41:34.871 --> 01:41:35.915
- So where are you staying?

2089
01:41:36.002 --> 01:41:38.048
- Um. Bidwell Hall.

2090
01:41:38.135 --> 01:41:39.049
- Okay. I'm gonna help
you carry your books.

2091
01:41:39.136 --> 01:41:39.919
if you don't mind.

2092
01:41:40.005 --> 01:41:40.833
- Thanks.

2093
01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:41.834
- Here you go Edward.

2094
01:41:41.921 --> 01:41:42.835
Thank you and welcome.

2095
01:41:42.922 --> 01:41:44.620
Oh. oh. oh. you'll need these.

2096
01:41:46.621 --> 01:41:48.189
- Can I help you
guys with something?

2097
01:41:48.276 --> 01:41:49.842
Are you shopping
or are you going?

2098
01:41:49.929 --> 01:41:51.496
- Don't worry.

2099
01:41:51.583 --> 01:41:53.237
I think these boys can take
the books by themselves.

2100
01:41:53.324 --> 01:41:55.065
In fact. it may even
take them two trips.

2101
01:41:55.152 --> 01:41:57.763
- By the way. this.
girls water bottle.

2102
01:42:00.766 --> 01:42:01.680
- Step on up.

2103
01:42:01.767 --> 01:42:02.986
Don't forget the water bottle.

2104
01:42:05.641 --> 01:42:09.123
- Hey. wait. okay. you're
going to CCU now. right?

2105
01:42:09.210 --> 01:42:10.689
- Yeah. I received
a full scholarship.

2106
01:42:10.776 --> 01:42:11.603
- Are you serious?

2107
01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:13.039
Wait. how old are you?

2108
01:42:13.127 --> 01:42:14.693
- I'm almost 16. I
really wanted to go

2109
01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:17.043
to like an engineering
school or something.

2110
01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:19.133
but my parents
forced me to go here.

2111
01:42:19.219 --> 01:42:20.830
- It's not that bad.

2112
01:42:20.916 --> 01:42:22.745
I had to come here because it
was my grandma's dying wish.

2113
01:42:22.832 --> 01:42:24.964
literally. her dying wish for
me to come to this school.

2114
01:42:25.050 --> 01:42:26.183
- Her dying wish?

2115
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:28.968
- Yep. but you know what?

2116
01:42:29.055 --> 01:42:31.057
My Grandma knew best.

2117
01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:32.668
and your parents
probably do too.

2118
01:42:33.930 --> 01:42:35.932
- I've never really fit in.

2119
01:42:36.019 --> 01:42:38.500
because I've always been
younger than everyone else.

2120
01:42:38.587 --> 01:42:41.633
So I guess. it doesn't
really matter where I go.

2121
01:42:41.719 --> 01:42:43.374
- Well. I know how you feel.

2122
01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:44.984
I mean. I never really fit in
when I first got here either.

2123
01:42:45.071 --> 01:42:47.943
And I mean. not. about the
being young part. or anything.

2124
01:42:48.031 --> 01:42:51.948
but. now. I know this is right
where God wanted me to be.

2125
01:42:52.035 --> 01:42:54.168
- You seem to know
a lot about geeks.

2126
01:42:54.255 --> 01:42:56.126
- [laughs] No. I just
know another cracked pot

2127
01:42:56.213 --> 01:42:57.214
when I see one.

2128
01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:58.737
- Cracked pot?

2129
01:42:58.824 --> 01:42:59.564
- Uh. huh. have you
ever heard that story?

2130
01:42:59.651 --> 01:43:01.130
- No.

2131
01:43:01.218 --> 01:43:03.612
- Oh. one time there
was this water bearer

2132
01:43:03.699 --> 01:43:05.179
