Surely. there's a comedy bit
in all of this for you.

- (Scoffs)
- Oh. you think so?

377
00:24:15.722 --> 00:24:17.056
Show me somethin'.

378
00:24:17.156 --> 00:24:17.924
Absolutely not.

Alright. security. security.
we got a heckler.

398
00:24:59.632 --> 00:25:00.800
Get her out.

399
00:25:00.933 --> 00:25:01.834

Not as easy as it looks. huh?

406
00:25:16.048 --> 00:25:16.883
Alright. you put me on the spot.

407
00:25:17.049 --> 00:25:18.618
- You try it.
- Oh. no.

408
00:25:18.718 --> 00:25:19.786
No. no. no. no. no.

409
00:25:19.886 --> 00:25:20.987
I have tons of stuff.

410
00:25:21.053 --> 00:25:23.355
but you're just gonna have
to get me out of here alive

411
00:25:23.489 --> 00:25:25.157
and then I can show you
at my next gig.

00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:33.499
Seriously though.
don't you think this Ray guy

415
00:25:33.566 --> 00:25:34.834
is strange?

416
00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:36.569
Maybe a little odd.
Why?

417
00:25:38.671 --> 00:25:41.173
I just feel like
he's hiding something.

418
00:25:42.642 --> 00:25:44.143
Uh. he's probably just not been
around many people.

419
00:25:44.243 --> 00:25:45.377
I mean look at this place.

420
00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:48.581
Did you see the pill bottles
next to his bed?

421
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.653
What if he's a psychopath

422
00:25:53.753 --> 00:25:57.690
and tries to kill us
in our sleep.

423
00:25:57.757 --> 00:25:59.191
Oh. bitch. please!

424
00:25:59.325 --> 00:26:01.160
(Taking deep breaths)

425
00:26:06.365 --> 00:26:08.267
Why would he wait
until we're asleep?

426
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.836
So we're less of a fight.

427
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.571
Okay. you need to stop
right now.

428
00:26:12.705 --> 00:26:13.572

yourself out

429

so...

00:26:15.007 --> 00:26:16.776
Okay.

431
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:17.844
Don't say I didn't warn you.

973
01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:49.840
Actually.
I was almost literally dead.

974
01:01:49.974 --> 01:01:52.409
but my fabulously handsome

975
01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:56.380

best friend Kyle saved my life.

976

Uh. but ladies don't bother.

983
01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.560
he just recently came
out of the closet. so...

984
01:02:10.694 --> 01:02:11.561
Aw.

985
01:02:11.695 --> 01:02:13.998
Where he was hiding
from the raptor!

986
01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.933
Remember I was talking about
the raptor?

987
01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.234
Yeah. I wasn't kidding
about that.

988
01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:18.869
I wasn't kidding.

989
01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:20.270
But also just some--

990
01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.072
some genuine advice
for you guys.

991
01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:25.075
If you ever find yourself
running from a raptor.

992
01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:27.544
I suggest wearing comfy shoes.

993
01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:29.847
because they are really
fucking fast.

994
01:02:29.947 --> 01:02:31.181

995
01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:33.250
And they're really smart. too.

996

While me and Kyle
were running you know.

997
01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:37.554
Kyle's like.
"Oh. do you think he saw us?"

998
01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:41.091
(Laughing)

999
01:02:41.225 --> 01:02:42.692
And I was like. "Yeah. Kyle.
he saw us.

1000
01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:45.762
and he's probably doing
our fucking taxes. too."

1001

(Audience laughing)

1002
01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:48.098
"He's really smart."

1003
01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:49.900
He's like. "Oh. Julia. I just-

1004
01:02:50.034 --> 01:02:53.637
I saw you spent $200
at IKEA in July.

1005
01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:55.806
We could probably claim that
back on work expenses."

1006
01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.707

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:02.246
"Yeah. of course. Julia.

1011
01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:03.713
Also. one more thing."
