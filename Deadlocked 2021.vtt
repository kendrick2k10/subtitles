3
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.703
Another day
to live through.

4
00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.272
Better get started.

5
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.919
- You know. if you
took the stairs more.

6
00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.388
you might catch me next time.

7
00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:23.957
- I don't know if
you're aware of this

8
00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:26.226
but you're in handcuffs
right now. buddy.

9
00:05:27.428 --> 00:05:29.196
- Yeah. but that's not
because you caught me.

10
00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:30.364
Now. you wouldn't
have stood a chance

11
00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:33.200
if that freak
didn't snitch on me.

12
00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:36.637
- You mean the elderly
citizen who restrained you?

13
00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:41.442
- Well. I didn't wanna hurt him.

14
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:43.176
- Right.

15
00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.428
- Hold the door.

16
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.053
- Got an audition to be at.

17
00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:01.622
- See if you can
call the front desk.

18
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.162
Yeah.

19
00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:10.531
- Yeah. Hi.

20
00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:12.700
So the elevator's stuck.

21
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.534
You kiddin' me.

22
00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:15.268
This crap's gettin' old.

23
00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.204
- Wait. how often
does this happen?

24
00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:18.706
Look. I'll get
the elevator company

25
00:07:18.706 --> 00:07:21.041
over here just as soon as I can.

26
00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:24.077
Okay. And how
long has this gonna take?

27
00:07:24.077 --> 00:07:25.546
Shouldn't be too long.

28
00:07:25.546 --> 00:07:27.815
Could you be
more specific with the time?

29
00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:29.316
No.

30
00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:30.818
Sorry about this. everyone.

31
00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:33.587
We'll have you out of
there as soon as we can.

32
00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:36.089
- Let me see if there's
anything I can do about this.

33
00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:40.027
1306 to 782.

34
00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:42.496
You guys out?

35
00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:43.697
I'm in front waiting.

36
00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:46.133
- Actually. we're
stuck on the elevator.

37
00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:47.000
Are you serious?

38
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.002
Are you guys alone?

39
00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:50.237
- Negative.

40
00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:52.305
How soon you think you
can have us out of here?

41
00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.441
Daniels. I hate
to break it to you.

42
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:55.909
but I think you're
on elevator patrol

43
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:57.410
for the afternoon. kid.

44
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.980
I gotta go. I'm getting
a call for a 1016.

45
00:08:01.248 --> 00:08:03.150
- Okay. Stay safe.

46
00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:08.121
- Well. looks like we're not
going anywhere for a while.

47
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:10.123
We should probably
take these off. yeah?

48
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:12.526
- So you're new
to the force. huh?

49
00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:14.995
I'm sorry.

50
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:16.830
I'm Connor.

51
00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:19.432
- Officer Daniels.

52
00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:21.769
- And what's your name?

53
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:24.972
- Me?
- Yeah.

54
00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.273
- Oh. sorry.

55
00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:27.107
Just not you used to
anybody talking to me

56
00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:29.376
while I'm cuffed.

57
00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:30.611
I'm Mason.

58
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:32.012
- Well. it's nice
to meet you. Mason.

59
00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:32.946
- Sir. let's avoid
touching the perp please.

60
00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:33.781
- Sorry.

61
00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:40.588
Man. they're trying to freeze
us to death in here or what?

62
00:08:40.588 --> 00:08:42.990
- Dude. it's boiling in here.

63
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.224
- You're warm?

64
00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:49.229
- Yeah.

65
00:08:58.471 --> 00:08:59.940
What's happening?

66
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.975
- It's all right. They're
just working on the elevator.

67
00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:03.677
- What are you talking about?

68
00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:04.645
It's not all right.

69
00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:08.315
I'm gonna miss my audition
no thanks to this brat.

70
00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:10.584
Everything was fine
until you got here.

71
00:09:10.584 --> 00:09:12.019
- Sir. lower your voice.

72
00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:13.987
- Do you know what you've done?

73
00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:15.923
This was going to be
my role of a lifetime.

74
00:09:15.923 --> 00:09:17.524
I was going to make it.

75
00:09:23.964 --> 00:09:24.965
Excuse me. everyone.

76
00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:29.970
Connor here.

77
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.971
Hey. Jen.

78
00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:31.772
Hey.

79
00:09:32.773 --> 00:09:34.007
Yeah.

80
00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:36.376
Well. the craziest
thing just happened.

81
00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:38.411
The elevator got stuck.

82
00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.913
Yeah.

83
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:44.618
So unfortunately I don't think
I can get to this audition.

84
00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.021
Well. I was wondering.

85
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:51.358
is there any possibility I
could schedule another one?

86
00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:53.794
No. it's okay.

87
00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:55.462
No. I totally understand.

88
00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:56.697
Okay.

89
00:09:56.697 --> 00:09:58.666
Well. hopefully we'll
be working together

90
00:09:58.666 --> 00:09:59.800
sometime in the future.

91
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:01.869
Okay.

92
00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:03.070
Thank you so much.

93
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.805
Thank you. I appreciate it.

94
00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:06.139
Talk to you soon.

95
00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:06.974
All right. bye.

96
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.911
C'est la vie.

97
00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:19.619
What's up?

98
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.254
- I think you owe
her an apology.

99
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.326
- I'm sorry. did
I miss something?

100
00:10:27.594 --> 00:10:28.729
- You yelled at her.

101
00:10:30.097 --> 00:10:31.498
- When the lights went out?

102
00:10:31.498 --> 00:10:33.400
You blamed her for
missing your audition.

103
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.268
- It's fine. Can we
just drop it please?

104
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.172
- I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

105
00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:43.076
I mean. I'm gonna miss my
audition. but it's okay.

106
00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:44.344
I mean. it could have
been a huge opportunity

107
00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:46.113
but there'll be plenty more.
- Stop it.

108
00:10:46.113 --> 00:10:47.748
You're freaking her
out. Just apologize.

109
00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:49.249
- I'm not freaked out. okay?

110
00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:55.756
- This is a prank. right?

111
00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:56.589
- I don't know.

112
00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:57.390
You tell me.

113
00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.528
- I'm really sorry.

114
00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:03.831
- We're not the ones you
need to apologize to.

115
00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:09.803
- Hey.

116
00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:12.172
Hello?

117
00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:16.143
I'm Connor.
- Yeah. you're Connor.

118
00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:18.411
You said that to
everybody here already.

119
00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:21.381
- Well. what's your name?

120
00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:22.215
- Jacqui.

121
00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:27.921
Okay.

122
00:11:35.796 --> 00:11:36.629
- Jacqui.

123
00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:41.969
I'm really sorry for
whatever happened back there.

124
00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:46.506
I'm seriously really
sorry that I scared you .

125
00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:48.475
- I'm not scared. okay?

126
00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:49.276
It's fine.

127
00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:55.248
- What's up with the backpack?

128
00:11:57.584 --> 00:12:00.821
- So Connor. why don't you
tell us about yourself?

129
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.289
You're an actor?

130
00:12:02.289 --> 00:12:04.524
- Well. aspiring actor. yes.

131
00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:10.530
- Have you suffered any
head trauma recently?

132
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.799
- Huh?

133
00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:12.699
- Did you hit your
head or anything?

134
00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:13.867
- No.

135
00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.202
Are you
taking any substances?

136
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.871
- Are you asking
if I take drugs?

137
00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:20.007
- I'm just concerned
about your wellbeing.

138
00:12:20.007 --> 00:12:21.374
- I don't do drugs.

139
00:12:35.555 --> 00:12:36.857
- Dammit. cop.

140
00:12:36.857 --> 00:12:38.325
Just ask him if
you hear something.

141
00:12:38.325 --> 00:12:40.727
- Do you have power
outages here often?

142
00:12:40.727 --> 00:12:42.830
- This is weird.
even for this place.

143
00:12:46.133 --> 00:12:48.268
- So. it's Olivia. right?

144
00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.602
I never caught what you do.

145
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.273
- Mechanical engineer.

146
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.708
- So why do you live here?

147
00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:58.946
I heard at career
day that engineering
jobs pay really well.

148
00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:01.581
- Miss. why aren't you
in school right now?

149
00:13:03.316 --> 00:13:04.384
Help!

150
00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:06.286
- Sir.

151
00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.120
Help!

152
00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:10.023
- Sir. the elevator's stuck.

153
00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:11.491
I'm a police officer.

154
00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.226
What's going on out there?

155
00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:15.228
My girlfriend's
trying to kill me.

156
00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:17.064
- I've been there before.

157
00:13:17.064 --> 00:13:18.698
- Sir. I need you to
get to a safe place.

158
00:13:18.698 --> 00:13:19.532
I'm gonna send-

159
00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:27.107
1306 to dispatch.

160
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:33.013
Talk to me. Are you all right?

161
00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:40.787
- Shit!

162
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.141
- Dammit. Mason.

163
00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:23.130
- Asthma.

164
00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:27.634
1306 to dispatch.

165
00:14:27.634 --> 00:14:29.802
- I don't have my inhaler.

166
00:14:30.904 --> 00:14:32.572
- Dispatch. where are you?

167
00:14:32.572 --> 00:14:34.374
- I've got this. Just
take care of Connor. okay.

168
00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.243
Jacqui. Jacqui. look at me.

169
00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:37.077
Okay.

170
00:14:44.284 --> 00:14:45.118
- Connor.

171
00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:52.659
- Hi officer. I'm Connor.

172
00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:56.829
- Okay. Connor.

173
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:59.032
I'm gonna have you sit
down right over here. okay?

174
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.271
- What's wrong with her?

175
00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:07.474
- You can do it. slow breaths.

176
00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:13.546
- Hey. you need to get
the fire department

177
00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:15.048
and an ambulance
down here right now.

178
00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:15.882
- Focus on me.

179
00:15:17.517 --> 00:15:19.086
Let it out. slowly.

180
00:15:24.324 --> 00:15:26.393
Okay. Good. deep breaths.

181
00:15:27.627 --> 00:15:28.528
Okay. good.

182
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.464
Hello?

183
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:33.967
This is dispatch.

184
00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:35.435
Go ahead. 1306.

185
00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:36.869
Over.

186
00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:39.072
- I'm stuck in an elevator
with three civilians and a perp

187
00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:40.740
in an apartment
building on 5th Avenue.

188
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.309
- It's the Palmer apartments.

189
00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:44.111
- It's the Palmer apartments.

190
00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:46.413
I believe we're stuck somewhere
near the fourth floor.

191
00:15:46.413 --> 00:15:48.448
I'm requesting fire.
medical and backup.

192
00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.017
This is an emergency.

193
00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:52.285
I heard a violent
altercation in the hallway

194
00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.187
and we have a young
female in here

195
00:15:54.187 --> 00:15:56.389
who's suffering from
respiratory problems.

196
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:59.059
and a young male suffering
from drug withdrawals

197
00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:01.194
or an overdose or something.

198
00:16:01.194 --> 00:16:02.929
Send help. over

199
00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:04.264
10-4. 1306.

200
00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:05.965
Checking on available
units. Over.

201
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:06.899
- I don't do drugs.

202
00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:08.701
- See? You got through it.

203
00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:09.869
Won't be long now.

204
00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:11.138
Just keep breathing.
Stay with me.

205
00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:12.339
1306. all
available personnel

206
00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:13.973
are currently handling
other emergencies.

207
00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.776
but we will send the
first available units.

208
00:16:16.776 --> 00:16:18.878
ETA is two hours. Over.

209
00:16:18.878 --> 00:16:19.712
- Come again?

210
00:16:20.613 --> 00:16:21.848
ETA is two hours.

211
00:16:21.848 --> 00:16:23.416
We're flooded with
calls right now.

212
00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:24.884
Over.
- It's okay.

213
00:16:24.884 --> 00:16:26.753
They always overestimate the
amount of time they need. okay?

214
00:16:26.753 --> 00:16:27.687
It's okay.

215
00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.422
Just keep breathing.

216
00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:33.293
Good. Nice. long breaths.

217
00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:35.728
1306.

218
00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:38.831
- Look. I don't know
if it's fast enough.

219
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.967
This girl's asthma is terrible.

220
00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:43.370
There's gotta be
something else we can do.

221
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.604
Some sort of alternative.

222
00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.907
Maybe I can get
some outside help.

223
00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:49.342
Negative. 1306.

224
00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.010
Hold tight and wait for us.

225
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.446
I understand the situation.
but the safest thing for you

226
00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:56.149
and everyone in there is to
stay right where you are.

227
00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:58.518
Trying to exit or tamper
with that elevator equipment

228
00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.653
creates an incredibly
dangerous situation.

229
00:17:00.653 --> 00:17:01.821
Understood?

230
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:02.655
Over.

231
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.358
- 10-4.

232
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:06.593
Over.

233
00:17:06.593 --> 00:17:07.527
Hang in
there. officer.

234
00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:08.761
Over and out.

235
00:17:11.731 --> 00:17:13.466
- It's too long. okay?

236
00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:15.135
Her asthma's really. really bad.

237
00:17:15.135 --> 00:17:17.304
And with him acting like that.

238
00:17:17.304 --> 00:17:19.406
we're gonna need her
inhaler really soon.

239
00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:21.741
- Ma'am. I appreciate your
concern and all your help

240
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:24.544
but there's nothing
else I can do here.

241
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.213
- Yes. there is. sir.

242
00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.582
Look. I have personal
experience with this elevator.

243
00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:31.084
I know how it works.

244
00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:32.219
- What?

245
00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:33.286
- It's a long story. okay?

246
00:17:33.286 --> 00:17:34.987
The point is. I can get us help.

247
00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:36.723
All I need to do is
open these doors.

248
00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:38.491
If we're lucky. we'll
be opening on a floor

249
00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:40.427
and we can just walk
right out of here.

250
00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:42.862
- I can't permit any
tampering with the elevator.

251
00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:45.298
- Tampering's a strong word
for what we'd be doing.

252
00:17:45.298 --> 00:17:47.600
We'd just be opening the doors.

253
00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:50.370
- The dispatcher said
it was dangerous. so-

254
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.204
- No. it's not.

255
00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:53.906
I mean. it's...

256
00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.709
There's a slight risk
for only you and me.

257
00:17:56.709 --> 00:17:58.145
Nobody else in this room.

258
00:17:59.546 --> 00:18:01.548
I'm willing to take the risk
and I think you are too.

259
00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:05.485
Why did you become a cop?

260
00:18:05.485 --> 00:18:07.053
To enforce some rules
or to help people?

261
00:18:07.053 --> 00:18:08.054
'cause there's a
girl in this room

262
00:18:08.054 --> 00:18:09.156
that needs your help right now.

263
00:18:09.156 --> 00:18:10.257
So what's it gonna be?

264
00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:22.502
- I can't.

265
00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:29.909
Olivia.

266
00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:32.078
I'm sorry.

267
00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:33.880
- Tell that to her.

268
00:18:48.528 --> 00:18:49.896
- Keep it together. loser.

269
00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:06.413
Jacqui. I need to
see your phone.

270
00:19:06.413 --> 00:19:07.680
- Why?

271
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.948
We need to
call your parents.

272
00:19:08.948 --> 00:19:10.283
- You don't have to
call my dad. I'm...

273
00:19:10.283 --> 00:19:12.619
- He needs to know
what's going on here.

274
00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:13.953
Let's do this the easy way.

275
00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:22.028
- Just do what he says. Jacqui.

276
00:19:26.132 --> 00:19:27.033
Thank you.

277
00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:40.980
Hi. this
is Nathan Fields.

278
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.615
Sorry I couldn't take
your call right now

279
00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:44.183
but please leave me a message

280
00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:47.354
and I'll get back to
you as soon as possible.

281
00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:48.821
- Hi. Mr. Fields.

282
00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:51.724
I'm officer Daniels and I'm
here with your daughter. Jacqui.

283
00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:54.627
And she's having some
asthma issues at the moment.

284
00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:56.195
If you can give me a call
back when you get this.

285
00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.597
that would be appreciated.

286
00:19:57.597 --> 00:19:58.431
Thank you.

287
00:20:04.271 --> 00:20:05.104
Connor.

288
00:20:06.606 --> 00:20:07.440
- Sorry.

289
00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:33.266
1306.

290
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:38.971
- Olivia.

291
00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:45.144
All right. so how do we do this?

292
00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:48.281
- Okay.

293
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:49.649
Well. we're gonna need his help.

294
00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:52.852
Mason?

295
00:20:52.852 --> 00:20:53.820
With what?

296
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.121
- Somebody needs to watch her.

297
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:56.823
Otherwise her asthma
is gonna get worse.

298
00:20:56.823 --> 00:20:59.392
- Yeah. He's not exactly
the guy for that job.

299
00:21:00.393 --> 00:21:01.628
- Well. we don't exactly have

300
00:21:01.628 --> 00:21:02.895
a more qualified
candidate. do we?

301
00:21:08.368 --> 00:21:09.201
- Mason.

302
00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:10.970
Get over here.

303
00:21:14.507 --> 00:21:16.476
- So how can I
help. John McClain?

304
00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:18.445
- We need you to
sit with Jacqui.

305
00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:20.246
Just talk to her
and keep her calm

306
00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:21.481
while we open these doors.

307
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:24.216
- Wait. wait. is that
a request or a command?

308
00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:26.853
Pretty sure you can't force
me to babysit against my will.

309
00:21:26.853 --> 00:21:28.321
- Fine.

310
00:21:28.321 --> 00:21:29.322
Then it's a request.

311
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.792
- Oh well. I'd be
happy to help them.

312
00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.126
So what do I get in return?

313
00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:38.565
Come on.
- Just tell us what you want.

314
00:21:38.565 --> 00:21:42.735
- Okay. well. for starters.
take these cuffs off.

315
00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:44.303
No.

316
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.105
We can't trust him.
He's dangerous.

317
00:21:46.105 --> 00:21:47.907
Yeah. 'cause I
might steal your wallet.

318
00:21:47.907 --> 00:21:48.741
- Mason. please.

319
00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.210
- Okay. Fine.

320
00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:53.279
I'd take some booze.

321
00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:56.749
- What?
- Yeah. Come on.

322
00:21:56.749 --> 00:21:59.151
I saw you sneaking something
in the corner there.

323
00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:03.890
- Okay. Go.

324
00:22:05.091 --> 00:22:06.793
- And don't let her
look at Connor. okay.

325
00:22:06.793 --> 00:22:09.962
Anything you have to do to
keep your mind off the asthma.

326
00:22:09.962 --> 00:22:11.531
- Yeah. I can do that.

327
00:22:19.472 --> 00:22:20.306
Hi.

328
00:22:21.908 --> 00:22:22.942
- One.

329
00:22:22.942 --> 00:22:24.411
Two.

330
00:22:24.411 --> 00:22:25.211
Three.

331
00:22:34.454 --> 00:22:35.422
- Jeez. take it easy.

332
00:22:35.422 --> 00:22:36.989
You're talking my ear off here.

333
00:22:39.225 --> 00:22:41.428
Oh. so what's in the
bag anyway? Can I look?

334
00:22:43.896 --> 00:22:45.632
I'll just take that as a yes.

335
00:22:45.632 --> 00:22:46.433
Ow!

336
00:22:46.433 --> 00:22:47.366
Easy. kid.

337
00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:48.935
- Don't call me a kid. dumb ass.

338
00:22:51.638 --> 00:22:53.105
- Okay.
- Now what.

339
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.475
- Let go on three.

340
00:22:55.475 --> 00:22:56.443
One.

341
00:22:56.443 --> 00:22:57.343
Two.

342
00:22:57.343 --> 00:22:58.144
Three.

343
00:23:01.548 --> 00:23:04.517
- Well. we're not
getting out that way.

344
00:23:05.618 --> 00:23:07.687
- Maybe we don't have to.

345
00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:10.490
Someone could bring
us the inhaler.

346
00:23:12.258 --> 00:23:13.092
- Olivia.

347
00:23:15.194 --> 00:23:16.496
- You come prepared. girl.

348
00:23:18.698 --> 00:23:19.499
- Thanks.

349
00:23:20.667 --> 00:23:22.902
- We need something to
wedge these doors open.

350
00:23:24.937 --> 00:23:26.105
- Well. we got nothing.

351
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.008
- Would this work?

352
00:23:32.211 --> 00:23:33.045
- That'll do it.

353
00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:43.590
- Hey. officer.

354
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.824
- How are you feeling. Connor?

355
00:23:44.824 --> 00:23:46.325
- Pretty good. really?

356
00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:47.827
- You want some water?

357
00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:48.995
- Sure.

358
00:23:48.995 --> 00:23:50.162
Why not?

359
00:23:50.162 --> 00:23:50.997
- Hey. hey.

360
00:23:51.898 --> 00:23:52.999
You can't look at him.

361
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:57.770
- They're not watching.
- I'm worried about him.

362
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.238
- You'll still get your booze.

363
00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:02.475
Yeah. I heard you guys talking.

364
00:24:02.475 --> 00:24:05.411
You weren't exactly
quiet and oh yeah.

365
00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:07.246
you were like five
feet over there?

366
00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:10.216
- Look. look. that wasn't
about the booze. okay?

367
00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:12.084
That cop. he thinks he can
make me do whatever he wants.

368
00:24:12.084 --> 00:24:13.419
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

369
00:24:13.419 --> 00:24:14.654
Just shut up about it. okay?

370
00:24:14.654 --> 00:24:15.488
I get it.

371
00:24:18.024 --> 00:24:19.391
Again. on three.

372
00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:20.226
- Let me see him.

373
00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:28.167
I will punch you again.

374
00:24:28.167 --> 00:24:29.001
- Fine.

375
00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:37.644
- Is he gonna be okay?

376
00:24:39.378 --> 00:24:41.447
- Look. you just worry
about yourself. okay?

377
00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:51.624
- Jack. look at me. it's okay.

378
00:24:51.624 --> 00:24:53.192
Hey. guys.

379
00:24:54.594 --> 00:24:55.595
- That's it!

380
00:25:03.903 --> 00:25:05.071
What happened?

381
00:25:05.905 --> 00:25:07.173
- What did you do?

382
00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:09.208
- Man. look cop. there's
something seriously off

383
00:25:09.208 --> 00:25:10.677
with this dude.

384
00:25:10.677 --> 00:25:13.179
Hey look. his eyes were all
screwed up for a second.

385
00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:15.281
When she saw that. her
asthma flared up again.

386
00:25:15.281 --> 00:25:16.883
You gotta do something
about this guy.

387
00:25:16.883 --> 00:25:17.817
- I knew I couldn't trust you.

388
00:25:17.817 --> 00:25:19.318
- And you're not listening.

389
00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:21.087
Some scary shit just
went down here. okay?

390
00:25:21.087 --> 00:25:22.021
You really gotta do-

391
00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:23.723
- Hey. I don't wanna hear it.

392
00:25:24.791 --> 00:25:26.125
- Officer.

393
00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:27.293
He's telling...
- Jacqui. Jacqui.

394
00:25:27.293 --> 00:25:28.227
Don't talk. okay?

395
00:25:28.227 --> 00:25:30.229
Just focus on your breathing.

396
00:25:30.229 --> 00:25:31.063
Okay?

397
00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:35.467
- Hello!

398
00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:36.402
Can anyone hear me?

399
00:25:37.637 --> 00:25:38.537
We're in the elevator.

400
00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:39.371
We need help.

401
00:25:46.412 --> 00:25:47.847
What are you doing?

402
00:25:47.847 --> 00:25:49.916
- I'm recruiting my sister
to get that inhaler.

403
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.451
Ali.
- Liv. I just heard

404
00:25:52.451 --> 00:25:54.186
a bunch of gunshots in the hall.

405
00:25:54.186 --> 00:25:55.655
- Are you okay?

406
00:25:55.655 --> 00:25:57.023
There's something
going on in the hall.

407
00:25:57.023 --> 00:25:58.958
- Sir. sir. we're
in the elevator.

408
00:25:58.958 --> 00:26:00.760
We need help.

409
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.328
- Okay. just lock the door?

410
00:26:02.328 --> 00:26:03.362
I'm gonna be there
as soon as I can.

411
00:26:03.362 --> 00:26:05.297
Everything's gonna be okay.

412
00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:07.199
Listen. there's someone in
here with really bad asthma.

413
00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:08.567
Can you please go
to her apartment

414
00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:09.568
and get her inhaler?

415
00:26:10.737 --> 00:26:11.871
Please.

416
00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:13.740
- Yes. Yes. of course.

417
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.175
- Thank you. Hold on one sec.

418
00:26:17.877 --> 00:26:20.179
- 605. probably on
the kitchen counter.

419
00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:23.650
- Okay. No. no. no.

420
00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.051
Don't put your hand in here.
That's how you lose it.

421
00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:27.186
I'm gonna just toss
it to you. okay?

422
00:26:27.186 --> 00:26:29.288
It's apartment 605.

423
00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:32.224
Probably somewhere on the
kitchen counter. okay?

424
00:26:32.224 --> 00:26:33.492
- All right.

425
00:26:33.492 --> 00:26:34.994
I'll be back as fast as I can.

426
00:26:36.162 --> 00:26:38.264
I'm John from 419.

427
00:26:38.264 --> 00:26:39.531
You're Olivia. right?

428
00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:40.599
I think I've seen
you around before.

429
00:26:42.869 --> 00:26:43.870
Got it. Going.

430
00:26:46.572 --> 00:26:47.406
- Thank you.

431
00:26:52.011 --> 00:26:53.179
- Nice work.

432
00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:54.280
Thanks.

433
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.415
- Nice work yourself. officer.

434
00:26:56.415 --> 00:26:57.216
- Lee.

435
00:26:58.918 --> 00:27:00.386
- I don't know any other Lees.

436
00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:03.155
No. I lied.

437
00:27:03.155 --> 00:27:03.990
Lee Harvey Oswald.

438
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.957
- Oh yeah.

439
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:05.925
- Yeah.
- Harvey.

440
00:27:10.797 --> 00:27:13.399
- Olivia. officer Lee.

441
00:27:13.399 --> 00:27:15.902
- You didn't hold up
your end of the bargain.

442
00:27:15.902 --> 00:27:17.036
We can't give this guy an inch.

443
00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:19.071
- Come on. Let's keep the peace.

444
00:27:20.807 --> 00:27:25.812
- Oh.

445
00:27:26.946 --> 00:27:27.780
Ooh!

446
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:30.382
- One drink is plenty.

447
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.651
- Oh. come on.

448
00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:35.521
I'll let you hit me with
public intoxication.

449
00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:37.123
- Here. officer.

450
00:27:37.123 --> 00:27:39.125
You need this more
than any of us.

451
00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:40.559
- I'm not off duty till five.

452
00:27:42.528 --> 00:27:43.963
- You're not gonna offer me any?

453
00:27:45.732 --> 00:27:48.000
What? You don't think
I can handle my liquor?

454
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.368
Is that it?
- Calm down.

455
00:27:49.368 --> 00:27:50.837
Nobody's saying that.

456
00:27:50.837 --> 00:27:51.637
You're just feeling a
little under the weather.

457
00:27:51.637 --> 00:27:52.872
So we're just gonna-

458
00:27:52.872 --> 00:27:54.006
- Don't tell me
how I feel. bitch.

459
00:28:02.048 --> 00:28:03.149
- Don't look at him. Jack.

460
00:28:07.053 --> 00:28:08.287
- Well. hello.

461
00:28:08.287 --> 00:28:09.956
- Do you mind if I
touch your forehead?

462
00:28:11.257 --> 00:28:12.558
- Are you the makeup lady?

463
00:28:13.726 --> 00:28:16.395
I'm really excited
for today's scenes.

464
00:28:16.395 --> 00:28:18.164
especially the kissing one.

465
00:28:18.164 --> 00:28:18.998
- Okay.

466
00:28:22.101 --> 00:28:24.003
Okay. you're really warm.

467
00:28:24.003 --> 00:28:27.239
- Jacqui. can you get us
another water bottle for Connor?

468
00:28:31.978 --> 00:28:33.846
- What if I don't
wanna give him any?

469
00:28:33.846 --> 00:28:35.948
- The fever's making
him act like a weirdo.

470
00:28:35.948 --> 00:28:36.883
Water's gonna help.

471
00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:58.170
- 1306 to 782.

472
00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:00.873
Hey. go ahead 1306.

473
00:29:00.873 --> 00:29:02.408
- Matthews.

474
00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:03.943
What happened? I couldn't
get a hold of you earlier.

475
00:29:03.943 --> 00:29:06.112
I was in
radio silence on the 1016.

476
00:29:06.112 --> 00:29:07.814
It's a long story.

477
00:29:07.814 --> 00:29:09.048
Listen. things are crazy.

478
00:29:09.048 --> 00:29:11.150
So I don't got a
lot of time. kid.

479
00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.885
- Things are crazy here too.

480
00:29:12.885 --> 00:29:14.186
We've got a girl
with severe asthma

481
00:29:14.186 --> 00:29:16.722
and a guy who's running
an extremely high fever.

482
00:29:16.722 --> 00:29:18.958
And there's been some violent
sounds in the building.

483
00:29:18.958 --> 00:29:21.593
Yeah. Sounds like
the apartments I remember.

484
00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:22.594
Listen Daniels. I gotta run.

485
00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:25.832
I'm on my way to
a 1034 downtown.

486
00:29:25.832 --> 00:29:27.599
- Did you say a 1034?

487
00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:28.567
Yeah.
I just geared up.

488
00:29:28.567 --> 00:29:29.735
I'm heading there now.

489
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.040
- All right. well. take
care of yourself. partner.

490
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.908
Stay
safe. Over and out.

491
00:29:39.846 --> 00:29:41.180
- What's a 1034?

492
00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:43.415
- Rioting.

493
00:29:48.454 --> 00:29:49.288
- Rioting?

494
00:29:56.428 --> 00:29:57.830
- Here.

495
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:58.664
- Okay.

496
00:30:28.294 --> 00:30:29.395
Help.

497
00:30:29.395 --> 00:30:30.229
- Shut up.

498
00:30:31.463 --> 00:30:33.365
- Where's everyone going?

499
00:30:33.365 --> 00:30:34.766
What's happening?

500
00:30:40.639 --> 00:30:42.108
- Hey.

501
00:30:49.248 --> 00:30:52.118
- Come on.
- He's trying to get her.

502
00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:08.434
- Jacqui.

503
00:31:13.405 --> 00:31:14.907
Come here. look at me.

504
00:31:14.907 --> 00:31:15.707
We're gonna take one of
those deep. slow breaths.

505
00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:16.508
Okay? Look at me.

506
00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:17.476
No. Slow breaths.

507
00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:23.015
Look at me. Can
you please. Jacqui.

508
00:31:23.015 --> 00:31:24.250
Come on. Jacqui.

509
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.952
- Let me in. let
me in. let me in.

510
00:31:25.952 --> 00:31:27.119
- Inhaler.

511
00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:28.720
- Help me in. Olivia.

512
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.322
- John. give me the inhaler now.

513
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:36.695
Here. Jacqui.

514
00:31:46.772 --> 00:31:47.573
Oh my God.

515
00:31:54.113 --> 00:31:55.081
- Lee.

516
00:31:55.081 --> 00:31:56.949
I'm really. really sorry. Lee.

517
00:32:00.286 --> 00:32:01.954
- Hey dude. hey don't do that.

518
00:32:01.954 --> 00:32:04.090
- Officer. help me in.

519
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.024
- Sir.

520
00:32:05.024 --> 00:32:06.025
I'm ordering you to stop.

521
00:32:06.025 --> 00:32:07.326
You're gonna get
chopped in half.

522
00:32:07.326 --> 00:32:08.827
- Olivia. pull me in please.

523
00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:10.862
They're coming.

524
00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:11.863
- Who's coming?

525
00:32:19.605 --> 00:32:22.174
- Well. pull me in. pull me in.

526
00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:24.776
Pull. pull.

527
00:32:44.363 --> 00:32:46.332
- Boost me up.
- Olivia. no.

528
00:32:46.332 --> 00:32:48.434
We need to close this.
- Mason. boost me.

529
00:32:53.339 --> 00:32:54.906
John.

530
00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:55.774
Are you all right?

531
00:32:57.009 --> 00:32:58.277
What happened to your leg?

532
00:33:00.879 --> 00:33:05.851
John.

533
00:33:15.694 --> 00:33:17.529
I don't see anything.

534
00:33:45.391 --> 00:33:46.558
- What happened to John?

535
00:33:46.558 --> 00:33:47.793
- I don't know.

536
00:33:47.793 --> 00:33:48.760
He's just. his leg
was all bloody.

537
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.828
He just limped away.

538
00:33:49.828 --> 00:33:50.662
- Mom.

539
00:33:55.801 --> 00:33:57.103
I want my mommy.

540
00:34:03.175 --> 00:34:04.110
- She's gonna get in here.

541
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:05.111
- Everyone. close the door.

542
00:34:09.115 --> 00:34:10.982
- Get her off.

543
00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:11.817
Get her off.

544
00:34:13.585 --> 00:34:14.753
- Stop moving.

545
00:34:32.171 --> 00:34:33.004
- Ali.

546
00:34:35.107 --> 00:34:36.608
Hey.

547
00:34:36.608 --> 00:34:39.645
Olivia. there's a
dead woman in your room.

548
00:34:39.645 --> 00:34:40.779
- What?

549
00:34:40.779 --> 00:34:42.013
I don't know.

550
00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:43.749
I just stepped away
for like two minutes.

551
00:34:43.749 --> 00:34:45.016
She must've come in then.

552
00:34:46.152 --> 00:34:48.053
- Okay. Okay.

553
00:34:48.053 --> 00:34:48.987
You need to call the cops. okay?

554
00:34:48.987 --> 00:34:49.788
Don't leave the apartment.

555
00:34:49.788 --> 00:34:51.190
Just lock the door.

556
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.091
There's something
happening in the building.

557
00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:55.627
What do you mean?

558
00:34:55.627 --> 00:34:57.028
- I don't know.

559
00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:58.164
People are going crazy.

560
00:34:58.997 --> 00:35:00.232
What?

561
00:35:00.232 --> 00:35:01.633
- Just lock the door
and call the cops. okay?

562
00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:02.968
Just don't leave.

563
00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:03.802
Okay. Okay.

564
00:35:03.802 --> 00:35:05.371
- Okay. I love you.

565
00:35:05.371 --> 00:35:06.705
I love you too.

566
00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:07.539
- Okay. bye.

567
00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:18.617
- 1306 to dispatch. Do you copy?

568
00:35:22.688 --> 00:35:24.890
1306 to 782.

569
00:35:36.602 --> 00:35:38.237
- I don't think
he's breathing. man.

570
00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:54.320
- Wait.

571
00:35:56.488 --> 00:35:57.323
Hang on.

572
00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.161
Stop.

573
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.130
You don't wanna get what he has.

574
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:05.964
- That's smart.

575
00:36:17.976 --> 00:36:19.711
- He moved. I just saw him move.

576
00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:20.546
- Are you sure?

577
00:36:21.747 --> 00:36:22.581
- Connor.

578
00:36:23.482 --> 00:36:24.683
Connor. wake up.

579
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:45.771
Connor. calm down.

580
00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:49.508
Connor. stop.

581
00:36:51.777 --> 00:36:53.245
- Lee.

582
00:36:53.245 --> 00:36:54.813
- Stop moving. that's an order.

583
00:36:59.918 --> 00:37:01.086
- Lee. come on.

584
00:37:04.923 --> 00:37:06.224
- I wanna help you.

585
00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:07.759
Will you let me do that?

586
00:37:09.094 --> 00:37:10.195
Connor. stop.

587
00:37:10.195 --> 00:37:14.700
Please.

588
00:37:29.781 --> 00:37:30.616
- Lee.

589
00:39:26.998 --> 00:39:29.034
- Jacqui. can I use this?

590
00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:49.555
- Hey Jack. you got
anything else in there

591
00:39:49.555 --> 00:39:50.689
that could help us out?

592
00:40:06.204 --> 00:40:08.774
Well. this could come in handy.

593
00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:22.053
- They're not picking up.

594
00:40:22.053 --> 00:40:23.288
- What?

595
00:40:23.288 --> 00:40:24.456
- 911. I've called
like five times.

596
00:40:24.456 --> 00:40:26.024
No one's answering.

597
00:40:26.024 --> 00:40:27.559
- Why wouldn't
they be answering?

598
00:40:29.895 --> 00:40:31.463
- There's a bunch of
weird noises outside.

599
00:40:31.463 --> 00:40:32.831
I don't know what's going on.

600
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:05.531
- Help me with these doors.

601
00:41:05.531 --> 00:41:06.798
- What are you doing?

602
00:41:06.798 --> 00:41:08.266
- That woman over there
was gonna fit in here.

603
00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:09.467
That means I can squeeze out.

604
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:10.969
- Yeah. or let all of them in.

605
00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:12.504
- We need to talk
about this first.

606
00:41:12.504 --> 00:41:13.471
- There's nothing to talk about.

607
00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:14.906
It's my sister and I'm going.

608
00:41:18.577 --> 00:41:19.410
Please.

609
00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:25.917
- Idiots.

610
00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:28.353
Wait. I'll get that side.

611
00:41:29.821 --> 00:41:31.790
I have a feeling we're
probably gonna need that gun.

612
00:41:33.859 --> 00:41:35.360
- Jacqui.
- Yup.

613
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.028
- Put this in the door
when they get it open.

614
00:41:37.028 --> 00:41:38.363
Okay.

615
00:41:40.866 --> 00:41:41.700
- Ready?

616
00:41:42.701 --> 00:41:44.235
One.

617
00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:45.737
Two.

618
00:41:45.737 --> 00:41:46.538
Three.

619
00:41:48.039 --> 00:41:49.374
- Okay now. Jack.

620
00:41:49.374 --> 00:41:50.241
- I got it.

621
00:41:55.513 --> 00:41:57.048
- Do you hear that?

622
00:42:00.485 --> 00:42:02.888
- I don't hear anything.
- Sh!

623
00:42:17.936 --> 00:42:19.204
Close the door.

624
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:31.917
That was John. wasn't it?

625
00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.128
- She's okay.

626
00:42:44.095 --> 00:42:44.996
She's okay.

627
00:42:46.031 --> 00:42:47.833
- Backup will be
here any minute.

628
00:42:47.833 --> 00:42:49.300
They'll send a whole
squad to get her.

629
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.202
Wait. what.
that's your plan?

630
00:42:51.202 --> 00:42:52.003
Yeah.

631
00:42:53.371 --> 00:42:55.406
- Look. 911 is not
working. there's rioting.

632
00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.875
You can't even get
a hold of anybody.

633
00:42:56.875 --> 00:42:59.010
Things are going south. fast.

634
00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:00.011
- They'll be here.

635
00:43:00.011 --> 00:43:00.946
I'm not giving up on them.

636
00:43:00.946 --> 00:43:02.380
- How long are we gonna wait?

637
00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.649
Till her sister dies?

638
00:43:05.116 --> 00:43:06.151
Till the power goes out and
we're stuck in here forever?

639
00:43:06.151 --> 00:43:07.352
Look. I'm a big boy.

640
00:43:07.352 --> 00:43:08.586
I ain't squeezing
outta here. all right?

641
00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:09.855
Look. we need a plan.

642
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:13.224
- Come on. dad.

643
00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:15.426
- Hey. what about you. MacGyver?

644
00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:16.662
What do you got?

645
00:43:16.662 --> 00:43:17.896
You're an engineer
or something. right?

646
00:43:17.896 --> 00:43:20.699
I mean. how would you
get us out of here?

647
00:43:20.699 --> 00:43:22.701
- If I could get up
to the control room.

648
00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:24.569
I could get this
elevator moving.

649
00:43:24.569 --> 00:43:27.572
- I don't like any plan where
you leave this elevator alone.

650
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:35.146
Hi. this
is Nathan Fields.

651
00:43:37.649 --> 00:43:38.583
- Matthews.

652
00:43:38.583 --> 00:43:39.985
I'm here. we still need help.

653
00:43:39.985 --> 00:43:42.220
Emergency evacuation.

654
00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.054
Over...

655
00:43:44.155 --> 00:43:45.023
Fire...

656
00:43:45.023 --> 00:43:46.391
- Matthews repeat.

657
00:44:09.614 --> 00:44:11.182
Okay.

658
00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:13.118
Let's get you up to
that control room.

659
00:44:13.118 --> 00:44:14.720
- Okay. so how are
we gonna do this?

660
00:44:17.789 --> 00:44:18.623
- It's quiet.

661
00:44:21.226 --> 00:44:22.728
Let's get these doors ready.

662
00:44:22.728 --> 00:44:23.561
Come on.

663
00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:27.632
- I'm about to be up there.

664
00:44:27.632 --> 00:44:28.834
Listen. Olivia.

665
00:44:28.834 --> 00:44:29.901
I hear loud noises
getting going.

666
00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:30.802
They're all angry.

667
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.305
- Okay. You need to hold on
for just a few more minutes.

668
00:44:34.305 --> 00:44:35.540
I'm about to be up there.

669
00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.775
- Jacqui.
- Yeah.

670
00:44:36.775 --> 00:44:38.209
- Cover us.
- Really?

671
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.049
- Ready?

672
00:44:44.049 --> 00:44:45.316
- Pull.

673
00:44:45.316 --> 00:44:47.118
There's so
many in the hall.

674
00:44:47.118 --> 00:44:49.855
I can't get out of
here and get past them.

675
00:44:49.855 --> 00:44:50.889
- I'm bringing back up.

676
00:44:50.889 --> 00:44:52.623
- Jack. now.
- Good.

677
00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:55.026
- Just sit tight. I'm
gonna see you really soon.

678
00:44:57.662 --> 00:44:59.030
- Liv. give me your phone.

679
00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:04.635
- Okay. I'm gonna bring the
elevator up to the top floor.

680
00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:06.037
We're gonna take
'em out together.

681
00:45:06.037 --> 00:45:08.539
- Look. I know you're
gonna want to move fast.

682
00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.441
but you need to be quiet too.

683
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:11.709
These things are loud.

684
00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:13.879
If you alert one. you
might alert them all.

685
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.181
- Here.

686
00:45:16.181 --> 00:45:16.982
I set it up.

687
00:45:19.084 --> 00:45:21.152
- You guys really
wanna do a video call.

688
00:45:21.152 --> 00:45:22.687
- It's a good idea.

689
00:45:22.687 --> 00:45:24.790
That's the best way for us
to know what's happening.

690
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.548
- Hey. don't screw this up.

691
00:45:50.548 --> 00:45:51.482
- Boost me.

692
00:46:01.392 --> 00:46:02.227
- Wait.

693
00:46:05.163 --> 00:46:05.997
Take this.

694
00:46:13.038 --> 00:46:15.506
You know how to use it?

695
00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:16.808
- Yeah.

696
00:46:16.808 --> 00:46:18.043
- Good.

697
00:46:18.043 --> 00:46:19.744
There's two extra mags
in the front there.

698
00:46:21.146 --> 00:46:21.980
- Thank you.

699
00:46:37.295 --> 00:46:39.597
- Well. here we go.

700
00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:42.733
- So far. so good.

701
00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:43.869
No sign of 'em.

702
00:47:02.387 --> 00:47:04.455
I don't like this.
it's so quiet.

703
00:47:06.858 --> 00:47:08.359
Anything happening down there?

704
00:47:11.096 --> 00:47:11.997
- No. no. nothing.

705
00:47:20.505 --> 00:47:21.339
- What was that?
- Shut up.

706
00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:22.974
She's trying to listen.

707
00:47:22.974 --> 00:47:23.808
- Sorry.

708
00:47:36.922 --> 00:47:38.189
- What is that?

709
00:47:48.399 --> 00:47:49.334
- Olivia. hide.

710
00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:54.032
Okay. I'm
gonna keep moving.

711
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.003
Here. you guys watch
the stairwell below.

712
00:48:58.003 --> 00:49:00.238
I'm gonna keep an eye
out for anything above.

713
00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:07.445
- Well. your shoes look great.

714
00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:09.614
- Sorry. I can't
hold this while...

715
00:49:09.614 --> 00:49:10.648
Ow!

716
00:49:10.648 --> 00:49:11.482
- Olivia?

717
00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:18.523
- This video call idea sucks.

718
00:49:19.524 --> 00:49:20.758
How do I turn that off?

719
00:49:28.266 --> 00:49:30.101
- Olivia. there's
something up there.

720
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:33.504
- Go back down.

721
00:49:48.986 --> 00:49:50.288
I don't
hear anything.

722
00:50:13.878 --> 00:50:15.580
- Did you mute it?

723
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.849
- No. they were insanely quiet.

724
00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:21.686
Be careful. They're
headed downstairs.

725
00:50:27.125 --> 00:50:28.526
Looks clear to me.

726
00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:30.128
Damn it. not again.

727
00:50:37.268 --> 00:50:38.103
Okay.

728
00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:06.564
- Well. that's it.

729
00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.048
- She just needs a few minutes.

730
00:51:50.308 --> 00:51:51.876
One new message.

731
00:51:55.346 --> 00:51:56.214
Jacqui.

732
00:52:01.018 --> 00:52:04.155
Remember that time we
camped by the lake?

733
00:52:04.155 --> 00:52:08.159
You and mom made that
whole bag of marshmallows?

734
00:52:12.797 --> 00:52:15.032
I was so proud of you. Jacqui.

735
00:52:23.674 --> 00:52:26.277
Your mom would be proud of you.

736
00:52:30.047 --> 00:52:34.285
Listen. you've gotta be
strong for me now. okay?

737
00:52:34.285 --> 00:52:35.286
I love you. Jack.

738
00:52:50.468 --> 00:52:51.669
- Are you okay?

739
00:53:04.982 --> 00:53:06.717
- Do you hear that?

740
00:53:06.717 --> 00:53:07.818
What?

741
00:53:09.887 --> 00:53:10.721
- Listen.

742
00:53:18.729 --> 00:53:20.531
- That sounds like a kid.

743
00:53:20.531 --> 00:53:21.366
- Let me look.

744
00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:33.744
It's a little girl.

745
00:53:33.744 --> 00:53:34.579
Hey.

746
00:53:36.681 --> 00:53:41.619
Come on.

747
00:53:41.619 --> 00:53:42.453
I can fit out here.

748
00:53:42.453 --> 00:53:43.288
I have to go get her.

749
00:53:43.288 --> 00:53:44.121
- No. no.

750
00:53:45.756 --> 00:53:47.091
Now let me look.

751
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.834
- It's too dangerous. Jacqui.

752
00:53:58.269 --> 00:54:00.805
- If I don't go out there.
they're gonna get her.

753
00:54:00.805 --> 00:54:02.907
I'm not asking for
your permission.

754
00:54:02.907 --> 00:54:04.141
- We can't protect
you out there.

755
00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:05.843
- I don't need protecting.

756
00:54:05.843 --> 00:54:07.778
- Right. Look. Olivia
had a real gun.

757
00:54:07.778 --> 00:54:09.414
- You're just assuming that
something bad happened to her.

758
00:54:09.414 --> 00:54:11.749
- She said those things are
on their way down here now.

759
00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:13.818
That girl crying is drawing
them in as we speak.

760
00:54:13.818 --> 00:54:16.521
- Which means that I need
to go get her right now.

761
00:54:16.521 --> 00:54:17.588
- No. no. Don't let
her do this. man.

762
00:54:17.588 --> 00:54:18.823
I got a bad feeling.

763
00:54:21.526 --> 00:54:22.893
- Lee. I need to do this.

764
00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:24.929
Please.

765
00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:36.006
Are you guys just gonna sit
here and listen to this kid die?

766
00:54:41.178 --> 00:54:42.780
- Listen to me.

767
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.915
You're gonna do this as quickly
and quietly as possible.

768
00:54:46.484 --> 00:54:48.285
If she resists. you
clamp her mouth shut

769
00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:49.119
and drag her back here.

770
00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.321
Don't be gentle.

771
00:54:50.321 --> 00:54:51.822
You're saving your
life. you understand?

772
00:54:51.822 --> 00:54:52.657
- Yeah.

773
00:54:53.558 --> 00:54:54.759
- Mason. boost her.

774
00:54:57.528 --> 00:54:58.429
- Ready?
- Yeah.

775
00:55:07.872 --> 00:55:08.706
- Good luck.

776
00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:20.284
- Hey. little girl.

777
00:55:35.032 --> 00:55:37.535
Hey. hey. are you all right.

778
00:55:37.535 --> 00:55:39.570
- Lee. Lee. get off.

779
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:40.505
Hold on.

780
00:55:40.505 --> 00:55:42.172
Let me look at Jacqui's phone.

781
00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:44.675
I think that video auto saved.

782
00:55:49.113 --> 00:55:49.914
- Are you okay?

783
00:55:52.282 --> 00:55:53.117
Hey.

784
00:55:57.788 --> 00:55:59.123
Everything's gonna be okay.

785
00:56:02.226 --> 00:56:03.661
Shit. man. Look. right there.

786
00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:06.697
- Jacqui.

787
00:56:06.697 --> 00:56:07.865
Jacqui. don't.

788
00:56:12.903 --> 00:56:14.705
Olivia. is that you?

789
00:56:14.705 --> 00:56:16.707
Take us back down.
Jacqui's not in here.

790
00:56:48.038 --> 00:56:48.973
- Jack. come on.

791
00:57:19.336 --> 00:57:20.170
- Get Jacqui.

792
00:57:30.481 --> 00:57:31.315
- Come on. Jack.

793
00:57:35.886 --> 00:57:37.588
- Let's go. Come on.
- Stay back.

794
00:57:52.036 --> 00:57:54.939
Okay. you saw what happened
to John after he was bit.

795
00:57:54.939 --> 00:57:57.107
He turned fast. I'll
try to kill you.

796
00:58:02.847 --> 00:58:03.914
- We're not leaving without you.

797
00:58:03.914 --> 00:58:05.449
- No. Okay?

798
00:58:05.449 --> 00:58:07.818
No one else is gonna
die because of me.

799
00:58:13.257 --> 00:58:14.458
- Mason. grab her.

800
00:58:15.893 --> 00:58:17.361
- What?

801
00:58:17.361 --> 00:58:18.596
Put me down.

802
00:58:18.596 --> 00:58:19.730
Do you wanna be the
one that has to do it?

803
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:20.731
Put me down.

804
00:58:28.939 --> 00:58:29.774
- Come on!

805
00:58:58.603 --> 00:59:00.437
I shouldn't have
let you do that.

806
00:59:00.437 --> 00:59:02.006
- You didn't know.
Lee. You didn't know.

807
00:59:02.006 --> 00:59:05.142
Okay. so we had to
do. okay. so we...

808
00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:26.496
When's mom gonna be back?

809
00:59:44.281 --> 00:59:46.383
Okay. I got it. I got it.

810
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:53.624
- Well?

811
00:59:54.792 --> 00:59:56.727
- There's three of them
down there at the end.

812
00:59:56.727 --> 00:59:57.662
Pounding on the door.

813
00:59:57.662 --> 00:59:58.863
It's gotta be a stair well.

814
00:59:58.863 --> 00:59:59.697
- Three?

815
01:00:00.865 --> 01:00:04.001
I guess those came
down to get us.

816
01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:06.403
- Yeah. well. if we
take them by surprise.

817
01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:08.305
I think we've got this.

818
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:12.643
- Guys.

819
01:00:30.695 --> 01:00:31.528
- Ali.

820
01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:33.831
Come on.

821
01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:36.233
Ali.

822
01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:37.067
Open up.

823
01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:41.538
- Oh shit!

824
01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.291
- Get down. get down.

825
01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:18.508
Here.

826
01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:23.313
- Where's the other mag?

827
01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:24.581
- Come on.

828
01:01:24.581 --> 01:01:25.983
Grabbed the belt.
I had to ditch it.

829
01:01:25.983 --> 01:01:26.817
I'm sorry.

830
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.756
- Olivia. hurry.

831
01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:37.728
- Ali.

832
01:02:19.136 --> 01:02:19.970
Ali.

833
01:02:31.715 --> 01:02:32.549
No.

834
01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:35.820
No.

835
01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:42.192
Lee.

836
01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:43.994
- Olivia.

837
01:02:59.877 --> 01:03:00.610
- Jacqui.

838
01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.701
Come on. kid.

839
01:03:24.701 --> 01:03:26.703
Your dad wants to
play one of his games.

840
01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.285
- Jack.

841
01:04:48.285 --> 01:04:49.119
Jack.

842
01:04:51.855 --> 01:04:52.689
Jack.

843
01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:16.806
- Olivia.

844
01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:21.011
Olivia.

845
01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:21.845
- No.

846
01:06:22.879 --> 01:06:24.048
- Olivia.
- No.

847
01:07:11.395 --> 01:07:12.229
- Jacqui.

848
01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:23.173
- When I do this. you're
gonna shut the door behind me.

849
01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:24.007
- What?

850
01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:30.147
- Take care of each other. okay?

851
01:07:32.516 --> 01:07:34.584
Look after Olivia for me.

852
01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:07.651
- Come on. man.

853
01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:08.885
We've got maybe a
couple of minutes

854
01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:11.488
before they break
that thing down.

855
01:08:34.478 --> 01:08:36.146
So what's your plan?

856
01:08:37.381 --> 01:08:38.615
- I don't know.

857
01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:41.084
- Jacqui?

858
01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.408
- There's a ledge out here.

859
01:09:04.408 --> 01:09:05.509
We can make it across
the other unit.

860
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.944
Let's go.

861
01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.314
- Pack that up.

862
01:09:11.681 --> 01:09:12.516
- Yeah.

863
01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:19.723
- Olivia.

864
01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:21.925
I'm sorry.

865
01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:25.762
but we have to keep moving.

866
01:09:27.564 --> 01:09:29.233
- I'm not going anywhere.

867
01:09:29.233 --> 01:09:30.334
I'm staying with her.

868
01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:44.481
- Set the timer
for three minutes.

869
01:09:45.882 --> 01:09:48.585
If we're not over there
by then. we're dead.

870
01:09:48.585 --> 01:09:49.753
Leave without us.

871
01:09:49.753 --> 01:09:50.687
- What are you
talking about. man?

872
01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:51.955
- There's no time. Just go.

873
01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:53.590
- Lee. man. She
doesn't wanna go.

874
01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:55.692
- I know.

875
01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.595
- Look. if you stay here-

876
01:09:58.595 --> 01:10:00.697
- I know. I got this.

877
01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:01.598
Just go. Mason.

878
01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:10.073
Hey.

879
01:10:12.276 --> 01:10:13.377
Take care of yourself.

880
01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:22.552
- I always do.

881
01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:30.727
- What are you doing?

882
01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:31.595
Get out.

883
01:10:34.764 --> 01:10:36.232
- I don't leave until you do.

884
01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:40.704
- Then you're gonna die.

885
01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:00.610
- Lee.

886
01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:41.751
You're still here?

887
01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:48.024
- You haven't quite
got rid of me yet.

888
01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:55.398
Let's get the hell outta here.

889
01:14:01.337 --> 01:14:03.773
- There's stairwells
to the left.

890
01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.108
Let's try for that.

891
01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:12.415
Back.
