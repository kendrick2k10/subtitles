3
00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:21.263
The world's fastest growing crime is abduction and human trafficking

4
00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:28.821
In 2017 24 million victims were estimated worldwide

5
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:31.821
Those who don't know history

6
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:32.821
are doomed to repeat it

7
00:00:36.378 --> 00:00:40.008
This film is based on a true event

8
00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:42.265
Due to years of cultural adaptations across Asia

9
00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:45.125
Elements may have been subject to artistic liberties

10
00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.461
Lanka. a once prosperous land

11
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.713
ruled by the wealthy king Kubera

12
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.383
now stands robbed and overthrown by a tyrant king

13
00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:34.511
Ravana

14
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.890
Women from all corners of the Earth are being snatched against their will

15
00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:42.310
to satisfy Ravana's lust and perverted thrills

16
00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:43.294
Let go of me

17
00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:44.374
Let go of me

18
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.118
Your...

19
00:01:46.665 --> 00:01:47.914
Where is your leader?

20
00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:49.928
If your leader is so powerful

21
00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:51.815
Why can’t he face us?

22
00:01:55.106 --> 00:01:57.358
We will fight our way out of this!

23
00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.663
I was only beginning to witness Lanka's sad state of affairs

24
00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:05.834
but however much I want to. I cannot yet interfere

25
00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.795
for the reason I was here were for matters else

26
00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.798
for a dear friend.. Lord Rama

27
00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:14.259
I had promised to help

28
00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:18.138
His beloved wife has been missing for almost a year

29
00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.641
a matter. no loving couple could ever bear

30
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.976
Don't worry

31
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:25.562
They say that…

32
00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:31.234
Ravana cannot rape anyone. he needs their consent

33
00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.987
This is due to a curse...

34
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:39.450
Once Ravana tried to molest a girl called Vedavati

35
00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:40.994
to escape him

36
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:44.372
she set herself on fire. her last words cursing him...

37
00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:48.668
That if he dared rape anyone again...

38
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.420
he will burst into flames and die

39
00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:52.338
Since then

40
00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.843
they say he is afraid to molest anyone

41
00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:10.440
All clues pointed towards Lanka's tyrant king

42
00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:13.902
if I find the princess here

43
00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:17.697
the hellish planets will shudder at the havoc I will bring

44
00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:21.117
My only sister is dead

45
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.373
Curse you Ravana

46
00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.751
you filthy pig

47
00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:35.632
may your wives. lands and riches

48
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.177
burn before your very eyes

49
00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.055
You may wonder

50
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.056
just exactly

51
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.057
who am I?

52
00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:48.937
my feats have made even Yama. the God of Death cry

53
00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.941
I have acquired many names over my long life

54
00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.782
But none of those matter to me any longer

55
00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:04.452
I am the servant of Rama. here to help find his wife

56
00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:11.542
Mother. does Ravana really have 10 heads?

57
00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:12.961
Sssh

58
00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.052
Please. leave me

59
00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.387
I do not like this

60
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:23.388
"like"?

61
00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.996
I will torture you into liking it

62
00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.602
The aura was dark everywhere I turned

63
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.646
for men had abandoned righteousness

64
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.523
with lust they burned

65
00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:37.735
Lust leads to greed. greed leads to anger

66
00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:43.074
anger leads to suffering. which was clear amongst Ravana’s Lanka

67
00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.454
Listen to me very carefully

68
00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:52.625
that lady has driven our king to madness

69
00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:55.712
there is some divine power in her

70
00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.298
You mean the one in the Asoka gardens right?

71
00:04:58.756 --> 00:04:59.757
Yes

72
00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:06.639
As soon as I saw her. I knew it was Sita

73
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:11.102
I was looking at a divine soul. the universe beneath her

74
00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:14.939
So you see

75
00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:18.651
every living being is a fragment of the ultimate

76
00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:21.612
there is the supreme soul

77
00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:23.656
and the energy force of nature

78
00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.075
that nature is feminine

79
00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:30.038
Never undermine your own nature as a female

80
00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:32.707
The soul doesn't have a gender

81
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.795
I hope that makes you happy for the morning

82
00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:41.591
Although her distress of separation from Rama was clear.

83
00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.177
her golden aura radiated more

84
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.263
than the gold paved city for which she didn't seem to care

85
00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:48.181
Sita

86
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.976
the way you talk of Rama. almost makes us fall in love with him too

87
00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:57.857
We have never heard of such an ideal man. ideal king. ideal husband

88
00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:02.779
where you left us last was where you stayed in the forest and saw the golden deer

89
00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:04.572
Do tell us more

90
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.581
Sister

91
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.001
the very day I saw the golden deer

92
00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:22.256
was the very fateful day I saw Lord Rama for the last time

93
00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:25.635
when I saw the deer

94
00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.512
I was hypnotised

95
00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:28.513
with desire

96
00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.057
desire of ownership

97
00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.018
the very trait that leads to one's downfall

98
00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.731
my loving Rama went to catch it for me

99
00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:40.900
that's when your...

100
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:42.902
king...

101
00:07:21.753 --> 00:07:22.754
Oh no! The King is coming

102
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:26.291
Run! We will be killed if caught here!

103
00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:41.171
Upon seeing Ravan. I realised what had become of him

104
00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:46.133
this was a man who had fallen to his own ego

105
00:08:24.499 --> 00:08:26.542
Sita. Sita

106
00:08:26.578 --> 00:08:28.497
beauty of all beauties

107
00:08:28.765 --> 00:08:32.810
whose face glows more radiantly than the sunrise by this tree

108
00:08:33.436 --> 00:08:35.104
if only you would look at me

109
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.036
I would make all my wives your handmaidens immediately

110
00:08:39.109 --> 00:08:40.151
Oh why?

111
00:08:40.151 --> 00:08:42.779
why does she not see this handsome Ravan?

112
00:08:43.321 --> 00:08:44.322
and his might?

113
00:08:45.079 --> 00:08:47.748
and put up this uneccessary fight?

114
00:08:52.556 --> 00:08:53.557
Darling

115
00:08:54.415 --> 00:08:59.170
I stayed awake the entire night and wrote this for you

116
00:08:59.337 --> 00:09:00.117
Will I turn away again without your love?

117
00:09:22.348 --> 00:09:25.142
You know many women die for my glance

118
00:09:26.305 --> 00:09:32.228
yet you still stick to your old. traditional marriage vows

119
00:09:35.833 --> 00:09:39.336
speak. please

120
00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:41.338
say something

121
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.510
Can a lotus flower grow in the light of a firefly?

122
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.393
You do not know of Rama's radiance

123
00:09:50.097 --> 00:09:52.057
you are but an insect in comparison

124
00:09:53.249 --> 00:09:55.209
nor have you faced his arrows in battle

125
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.547
You clearly displayed your so-called might when you abducted me

126
00:10:00.005 --> 00:10:02.716
only. and only when I was all alone

127
00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:05.534
to you women are objects

128
00:10:06.303 --> 00:10:08.138
but in the kingdom of Lord Rama

129
00:10:08.806 --> 00:10:11.183
every woman is treated as a Goddess

130
00:10:13.686 --> 00:10:14.687
Sita

131
00:10:15.104 --> 00:10:17.481
you have offered me one too many insults

132
00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:20.169
Have I not been a gentleman to you

133
00:10:20.192 --> 00:10:21.193
waiting for your consent

134
00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:23.756
Name me one king

135
00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:26.448
who has as much wealth as I do

136
00:10:28.255 --> 00:10:31.049
You could have anything you desire

137
00:10:32.723 --> 00:10:36.435
The wise do not find happiness in material things

138
00:10:37.001 --> 00:10:39.503
They find their joy looking within themselves

139
00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:42.584
Alright. I'm getting tired of this

140
00:10:42.923 --> 00:10:45.676
Pleasures conceived in the world of the senses alone

141
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.101
have a beginning and an end and eventually lead to misery

142
00:10:50.306 --> 00:10:54.059
nothing material is permanent happiness

143
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.891
And please be honest

144
00:10:59.106 --> 00:11:00.107
You are no gentleman

145
00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:04.116
the real reason you have waited for my consent

146
00:11:04.116 --> 00:11:05.618
is because of your curse

147
00:11:07.151 --> 00:11:09.653
that if you were to make love to one without her consent

148
00:11:09.997 --> 00:11:11.999
you would burst into flames

149
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:13.782
How do you know that?

150
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:16.642
Whose been speaking behind my back?

151
00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:18.626
Speak up

152
00:11:20.938 --> 00:11:21.939
Who told you this?

153
00:11:22.272 --> 00:11:23.273
How do you know this?

154
00:11:23.756 --> 00:11:25.466
who has been speaking behind my back

155
00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:26.670
Speak up

156
00:11:36.453 --> 00:11:37.329
Sita

157
00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:39.170
I have given you too much luxury

158
00:11:39.587 --> 00:11:40.754
You are my property now

159
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.251
You belong to me

160
00:11:42.446 --> 00:11:43.447
Do you understand?

161
00:11:44.057 --> 00:11:45.517
I should behead you here

162
00:11:48.948 --> 00:11:49.949
I do not fear you

163
00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:50.950
or your blade

164
00:11:52.117 --> 00:11:53.118
strike now...

165
00:11:53.906 --> 00:11:56.158
and you will only relieve me from my sorrow

166
00:11:56.181 --> 00:11:58.308
of being separated from my Lord

167
00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.690
O Ravana

168
00:11:59.708 --> 00:12:02.628
there are many concubines for you to enjoy today

169
00:12:02.795 --> 00:12:04.964
Why waste your time with her?

170
00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:06.960
Security

171
00:12:07.276 --> 00:12:08.110
You

172
00:12:08.884 --> 00:12:10.260
Do what you will with Sita

173
00:12:11.507 --> 00:12:14.718
but in one month. if she doesn't accept me willingly

174
00:12:16.225 --> 00:12:17.643
I will draw my sword again

175
00:12:18.185 --> 00:12:19.186
and this time

176
00:12:20.576 --> 00:12:22.035
her head will lie at my feet

177
00:12:22.332 --> 00:12:23.959
and so will all of yours

178
00:12:24.506 --> 00:12:26.967
and so will yours

179
00:12:35.432 --> 00:12:37.559
Look my husband has taken a liking to you

180
00:12:37.893 --> 00:12:40.312
if you don't give in. he will kill you

181
00:12:41.214 --> 00:12:42.507
I don't understand

182
00:12:42.904 --> 00:12:45.323
this kingdom has everything you would ever want

183
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.810
it can make your dreams come true. just say yes

184
00:12:49.065 --> 00:12:51.192
that is all you have to do. just give in

185
00:12:52.173 --> 00:12:53.883
just compromise

186
00:13:00.181 --> 00:13:04.685
This poor soul has endured a lot of sorrow. torment and pain

187
00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:08.121
I wanted to liberate her immediately. so it didn't happen again

188
00:13:09.488 --> 00:13:14.451
right now. if I make any move I put the mission and her at risk

189
00:13:15.514 --> 00:13:20.477
I must be stealthy and wait until night. so the task can be accomplished

190
00:13:23.349 --> 00:13:26.769
these moments felt like the passing of an entire age

191
00:13:28.151 --> 00:13:30.612
I couldn't wait to tell her of Rama. cheer her up

192
00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:33.063
and then show these demons my rage

193
00:13:35.993 --> 00:13:39.329
Only one month left

194
00:13:40.924 --> 00:13:43.760
Haven't forgotten me have you?

195
00:13:45.117 --> 00:13:47.911
the once beautiful Surpanakha

196
00:13:49.345 --> 00:13:51.722
who any man would die for

197
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.253
turned down by the handsome Rama

198
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.265
for you

199
00:13:59.782 --> 00:14:02.410
after what his brother did to me

200
00:14:03.337 --> 00:14:07.091
watch and see what my brother Ravana will do to you

201
00:14:29.155 --> 00:14:32.283
To the very personification of nobility and righteousness

202
00:14:32.434 --> 00:14:34.144
Glory to Rama

203
00:14:37.528 --> 00:14:40.156
Darling to his citizens and adhered to by many sages

204
00:14:40.599 --> 00:14:42.059
Glory to Lord Rama

205
00:14:43.848 --> 00:14:46.183
Whose heart belongs to princess Sita

206
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.262
Glory to Lord Rama

207
00:15:11.864 --> 00:15:14.575
What trickery is this?

208
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:24.636
Who now searches heartbroken for his beloved wife Sita

209
00:15:25.722 --> 00:15:27.599
and sent this monkey to find her

210
00:15:27.599 --> 00:15:29.393
Glory to Lord Rama

211
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.363
Please don't fear me divine Mother

212
00:15:33.406 --> 00:15:35.449
I came as Lord Rama's messenger

213
00:15:39.131 --> 00:15:41.341
I've never seen you in Rama's kingdom

214
00:15:42.373 --> 00:15:43.374
Who are you?

215
00:15:43.374 --> 00:15:45.585
How do you know my Lord and his anthem?

216
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.754
I have many names. but he calls me Hanuman

217
00:15:49.652 --> 00:15:50.695
you may do also

218
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.137
much has happened since you went missing

219
00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:01.475
now armies of monkeys are in search parties spanning all corners of the Earth

220
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:02.779
helping Rama find you

221
00:16:04.261 --> 00:16:05.304
Lord Rama?

222
00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:08.327
Search parties looking for me?

223
00:16:10.392 --> 00:16:11.894
is it really true?

224
00:16:12.748 --> 00:16:14.374
my Lord hasn't forgotten about me?

225
00:16:14.938 --> 00:16:18.233
Divine Mother. I know it is hard to believe

226
00:16:19.484 --> 00:16:22.321
but Lord Rama was confident I would be the one to find you

227
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.897
and so he gave me this ring to present to you as a token of trust

228
00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:27.242
How is he?

229
00:16:27.607 --> 00:16:30.276
He must have been so distraught from my sudden dissapearance

230
00:16:33.207 --> 00:16:35.751
by bodily health he may look well

231
00:16:36.082 --> 00:16:40.420
but I can barely begin to describe his distress. being separated from you

232
00:16:41.465 --> 00:16:43.926
He loves you twice as much as you love him

233
00:16:44.464 --> 00:16:46.382
he asked me to deliver this message

234
00:16:47.392 --> 00:16:48.768
Sita

235
00:16:48.867 --> 00:16:51.078
Ever since I have been separated from you

236
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:52.926
Everything has become its reverse

237
00:16:53.414 --> 00:16:56.875
Fresh and tender leaves on trees look like fire

238
00:16:57.468 --> 00:16:59.303
The moon scorches like the sun

239
00:16:59.503 --> 00:17:01.380
Lotuses look like spears

240
00:17:01.781 --> 00:17:04.868
Fragrant breezes sound like hissing serpents

241
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.071
I long with all my heart to see you again

242
00:17:09.171 --> 00:17:10.172
Divine Mother

243
00:17:10.564 --> 00:17:12.191
it brought much sorrow to my heart

244
00:17:12.224 --> 00:17:14.310
to see the pain in the eyes of King Rama

245
00:17:15.194 --> 00:17:17.113
and now after meeting you today

246
00:17:17.613 --> 00:17:19.824
I cannot bare to see another in pain

247
00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:22.168
of being separated from their loved one

248
00:17:23.494 --> 00:17:25.746
I wish I could take you back with me right now

249
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.499
but I see no practical way of doing so

250
00:17:32.277 --> 00:17:33.320
O Hanuman

251
00:17:34.263 --> 00:17:35.765
I'm so grateful for you

252
00:17:37.008 --> 00:17:38.926
You have delivered me from my sorrows

253
00:17:42.913 --> 00:17:43.914
However

254
00:17:45.233 --> 00:17:48.820
I worry for the state of several other women here like me

255
00:17:51.247 --> 00:17:53.500
I do not wish to leave them as they are

256
00:17:55.667 --> 00:17:57.502
I wish to wait for Lord Rama

257
00:17:58.354 --> 00:18:00.856
he will help bring reform to this society

258
00:18:02.309 --> 00:18:05.896
Indeed. I have seen the state of women in this dark kingdom

259
00:18:06.579 --> 00:18:09.040
yet. you had the strength to fight back

260
00:18:10.857 --> 00:18:12.234
Now that you have been located

261
00:18:12.402 --> 00:18:14.946
Await Rama's arrows fill these skies

262
00:18:15.129 --> 00:18:16.714
and wipe out these demons

263
00:18:17.166 --> 00:18:19.668
I will insure you and Lord Rama reunite soon

264
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.844
just begin reciting his glories

265
00:18:22.211 --> 00:18:25.005
and before you can be finished. we will be back

266
00:18:26.241 --> 00:18:27.242
Hanuman

267
00:18:27.617 --> 00:18:29.661
I'm so pleased to have met you

268
00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:31.571
and to hear of my husband

269
00:18:32.188 --> 00:18:34.148
but if I were to recite all his glories

270
00:18:34.264 --> 00:18:35.224
it would take me years

271
00:18:36.058 --> 00:18:37.476
please don't make it that long

272
00:18:39.302 --> 00:18:40.303
Here

273
00:18:43.982 --> 00:18:44.983
take this

274
00:18:46.068 --> 00:18:47.486
he will know it is mine

275
00:18:57.171 --> 00:18:59.590
May I ask. Hanuman?

276
00:19:01.417 --> 00:19:03.252
how do you know Lord Rama?

277
00:19:03.752 --> 00:19:07.548
what brought this alliance between man and monkey?

278
00:19:08.031 --> 00:19:09.908
He came to us seeking for help

279
00:19:10.843 --> 00:19:13.887
and my kind. we never turn anybody down

280
00:19:14.329 --> 00:19:15.413
as you know

281
00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:16.697
the rules state

282
00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:19.283
Rama is forbidden from entering any city

283
00:19:19.601 --> 00:19:20.352
But...

284
00:19:20.486 --> 00:19:21.821
I have witnessed myself

285
00:19:22.053 --> 00:19:24.473
how he doesn't need a kingdom to be King

286
00:19:25.116 --> 00:19:28.953
he is the loving friend of the poor. and treats all equally

287
00:19:29.611 --> 00:19:31.822
all my monkey friends now serve him

288
00:19:32.173 --> 00:19:35.426
and will be ready to lay their life down for him

289
00:19:38.254 --> 00:19:39.255
O Hanuman

290
00:19:41.933 --> 00:19:42.934
But Hanuman

291
00:19:44.093 --> 00:19:47.304
have you seen how big and ferocious the people here are?

292
00:19:47.847 --> 00:19:50.808
some apparently have battled beings on heavenly planets

293
00:19:52.435 --> 00:19:53.894
I worry

294
00:19:54.377 --> 00:19:55.921
For yourself and your...

295
00:19:56.531 --> 00:19:57.573
monkeys

296
00:20:00.025 --> 00:20:01.819
do you think you have the

297
00:20:03.821 --> 00:20:07.283
strength or experience in warfare?

298
00:20:18.836 --> 00:20:23.048
Even Lord Yama. the God of Death. shudders when he hears my name

299
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:27.052
I am sworn to help and protect those who come to me

300
00:20:27.344 --> 00:20:30.097
and those who pledge allegiance to Lord Rama

301
00:20:30.372 --> 00:20:34.835
What you are about to witness now is just a teaser of what my army is capable of

302
00:20:34.894 --> 00:20:37.938
Let me insure no demon torments you again

303
00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:40.790
until I return with Lord Rama

304
00:20:42.276 --> 00:20:45.321
Once Ravana is done with Sita

305
00:20:45.413 --> 00:20:46.414
who do you think he is going to pass...

306
00:20:47.264 --> 00:20:50.392
Fruit thief in the Ashoka gardens. kill it immediately

307
00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:09.203
Hand me the weapon of Lord Brahma

308
00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:34.812
I hope you all become better men in your next lives

309
00:22:34.963 --> 00:22:37.299
Once I've crushed your filthy skulls

310
00:22:38.853 --> 00:22:42.190
I shall slay this beast and prove that I am Meganath

311
00:22:42.596 --> 00:22:43.597
Son of Ravan

312
00:22:45.193 --> 00:22:46.402
You and you

313
00:22:46.584 --> 00:22:47.669
prove yourselves

314
00:22:54.327 --> 00:22:56.454
Don't you worry. it's not over yet

315
00:22:57.079 --> 00:22:58.956
I purposely fell to that weapon

316
00:22:59.264 --> 00:23:02.017
as towards it’s creator I have much respect

317
00:23:02.825 --> 00:23:04.910
Strip off his armour and take him to the King

318
00:23:24.346 --> 00:23:25.347
Who are you monkey?

319
00:23:26.583 --> 00:23:29.294
And how dare you injure my men?

320
00:23:29.472 --> 00:23:31.933
Have you not heard my name and trembled with fear?

321
00:23:32.694 --> 00:23:35.572
I am here as the messenger of Lord Rama

322
00:23:36.051 --> 00:23:37.052
Hanuman

323
00:23:38.205 --> 00:23:41.333
Have you no heard my Lord's name and trembled with fear?

324
00:23:41.844 --> 00:23:44.972
He who single-handedly defeated mighty tyrants

325
00:23:45.222 --> 00:23:46.724
mightier than you

326
00:23:47.323 --> 00:23:48.324
Foolish monkey

327
00:23:48.574 --> 00:23:52.745
You dare threaten me. the mighty Ravan

328
00:23:53.011 --> 00:23:54.971
with a name of a mere human being?

329
00:23:55.597 --> 00:23:56.890
Impotent monkey

330
00:23:57.766 --> 00:24:00.519
I am not the least troubled by your provocations

331
00:24:00.826 --> 00:24:01.952
Nor by your Rama

332
00:24:03.037 --> 00:24:03.621
Now

333
00:24:03.912 --> 00:24:09.042
How dare you steal fruits from my garden and injure my men?

334
00:24:10.263 --> 00:24:11.264
Funny

335
00:24:11.681 --> 00:24:14.267
The theft of a mere fruit enrages you

336
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.028
Yet you have no problem with righteousness

337
00:24:17.261 --> 00:24:20.055
to abduct human beings against their will

338
00:24:21.824 --> 00:24:24.118
How dare you?

339
00:24:24.427 --> 00:24:25.428
Regarding your men

340
00:24:26.012 --> 00:24:28.056
They attacked me with intention to kill

341
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:29.658
I attacked back

342
00:24:30.175 --> 00:24:32.636
Self defense Ravana

343
00:24:32.835 --> 00:24:34.128
It's Lord Ravana

344
00:24:35.186 --> 00:24:35.895
Please

345
00:24:36.248 --> 00:24:37.249
Heed my advice

346
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.044
Return the princess Sita to her rightful husband

347
00:24:40.146 --> 00:24:41.940
and give up your evil ways

348
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.987
Man is never beyond redemption

349
00:24:44.757 --> 00:24:46.133
My King is compassionate

350
00:24:46.258 --> 00:24:47.301
He will forgive you

351
00:24:47.737 --> 00:24:48.738
Really?

352
00:24:49.576 --> 00:24:54.205
I require the forgiveness of a mere human being?

353
00:24:55.411 --> 00:24:57.455
You know. Ravana

354
00:24:58.414 --> 00:24:59.874
If it wasn't for your ego

355
00:25:00.041 --> 00:25:06.005
Your sense of "I. I. I. Me. Me. Me. Mine. Mine. Mine"

356
00:25:06.465 --> 00:25:09.176
You could be a great King. like Rama

357
00:25:09.843 --> 00:25:14.723
Ravana will be damned. before he takes advice from a lowly monkey

358
00:25:15.182 --> 00:25:17.226
Just who do you think you are?

359
00:25:18.523 --> 00:25:20.275
Do you not know where you stand?

360
00:25:20.604 --> 00:25:23.357
You have been caught by the great Ravan

361
00:25:24.395 --> 00:25:25.438
Correction

362
00:25:25.952 --> 00:25:28.288
You have not caught the messenger of Lord Rama

363
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.286
The messenger of Rama let himself be caught to get a good look

364
00:25:31.411 --> 00:25:34.122
at the fool who waged war with his mighty Rama

365
00:25:34.989 --> 00:25:36.115
What I mean is

366
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.951
It is I who has captured you

367
00:25:39.318 --> 00:25:41.862
I will have you tortured and beheaded

368
00:25:42.209 --> 00:25:44.253
Choose your words wisely

369
00:25:44.832 --> 00:25:45.500
Hah

370
00:25:45.653 --> 00:25:47.863
Fool. there is no weapon on Earth

371
00:25:47.872 --> 00:25:50.834
or any other Heavenly planet belonging to any God

372
00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:52.219
that can harm me

373
00:25:52.507 --> 00:25:55.301
I could finish you right now if I wished

374
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.359
But as a messenger I would be insulting King Rama

375
00:25:58.438 --> 00:26:00.649
since I am missing a mandate from him

376
00:26:01.224 --> 00:26:03.267
Kill this creature immediately

377
00:26:04.477 --> 00:26:05.478
Stop

378
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.522
Forgive me your grace

379
00:26:08.277 --> 00:26:09.278
I'm sorry to interrupt

380
00:26:09.704 --> 00:26:13.333
But. it is against all statecraft to kill a messenger

381
00:26:16.493 --> 00:26:19.413
Vibishan. my brother

382
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.253
what good timing

383
00:26:22.495 --> 00:26:25.331
What do you suggest that we do with him then?

384
00:26:25.595 --> 00:26:27.305
Well. you might be able to punish him

385
00:26:27.504 --> 00:26:28.631
but we cannot kill him

386
00:26:33.826 --> 00:26:35.202
A monkey's tail

387
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.876
Is it's most precious possession

388
00:26:39.924 --> 00:26:42.510
If he were human I would have defaced him

389
00:26:42.686 --> 00:26:45.731
Such that he would not show his face again in a crowd

390
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.156
But as we are dealing with a monkey

391
00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.872
How would he show his bottom to the rest of the pack

392
00:27:15.775 --> 00:27:19.445
Bind his tail to rags and set it on fire

393
00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:40.790
Hanuman

394
00:27:41.741 --> 00:27:43.409
The fire does not burn you

395
00:27:43.956 --> 00:27:45.207
It is all in the mind

396
00:27:45.916 --> 00:27:48.460
I will make sure your protected from it

397
00:27:48.798 --> 00:27:50.467
You have proven yourself as a yogi

398
00:27:50.958 --> 00:27:52.918
and kept your vow of celebacy

399
00:27:53.182 --> 00:27:56.185
I grant you the 8 supernatural powers

400
00:27:56.385 --> 00:27:57.344
and 9 abilities

401
00:27:57.923 --> 00:27:59.008
Now Arise

402
00:27:59.518 --> 00:28:01.394
Remember your promise to Rama

403
00:28:02.461 --> 00:28:03.253
Arise

404
00:28:40.554 --> 00:28:42.723
Hanuman. my dear friend

405
00:28:43.359 --> 00:28:46.529
You are twice as dear to me as my own blood brothers

406
00:28:47.507 --> 00:28:50.135
I know you will be the one to find my beloved Sita

407
00:28:50.715 --> 00:28:51.966
I trust in you

408
00:28:52.156 --> 00:28:54.742
Remember how you shook the heavens as a mere child

409
00:28:55.095 --> 00:28:57.305
Remember that title you once held

410
00:28:57.828 --> 00:29:00.372
Great sage. Equivalent of heaven

411
00:29:01.643 --> 00:29:04.062
Hare Rama

412
00:29:29.193 --> 00:29:31.403
HARE

413
00:29:31.946 --> 00:29:33.364
RAMA

414
00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.526
O fools of Ravana

415
00:29:52.277 --> 00:29:53.945
Slaves of arrogance

416
00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.427
Is this all you have got?

417
00:30:35.775 --> 00:30:36.859
Lord Ravana

418
00:30:37.011 --> 00:30:38.762
I'm sorry I failed you

419
00:30:38.929 --> 00:30:42.099
Please spare my wives and daughters. please

420
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.071
RAVANA

421
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:59.215
I will leave you at the mercy of Lord Rama

422
00:31:01.107 --> 00:31:03.777
Just know that I could have killed you today

423
00:31:04.034 --> 00:31:05.119
If he had permitted me

424
00:31:05.308 --> 00:31:08.853
But my mission was only. and only to locate Sita

425
00:31:12.042 --> 00:31:14.628
But when I return with the mighty Rama

426
00:31:15.109 --> 00:31:17.195
you better be ready to surrender

427
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.982
Lord Shiva has come to free us all

428
00:31:52.878 --> 00:31:55.422
Soon Ravana will prepare for war

429
00:31:55.832 --> 00:31:59.086
But atleast for now. Sita wouldn't suffer anymore

430
00:32:00.033 --> 00:32:03.578
As I watched the biting flames leave Sita untouched

431
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:06.100
I realised something which will be told

432
00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.806
through many ages to come

433
00:32:08.746 --> 00:32:12.166
Sita wasn't the one being saved from Lanka

434
00:32:14.191 --> 00:32:16.819
Lanka was the one being saved

435
00:32:17.297 --> 00:32:18.381
By Sita

436
00:32:39.907 --> 00:32:42.944
Lanka is now known as Sri Lanka
