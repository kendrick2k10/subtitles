[helicopter engine roaring]

14
00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:34.605
- Hey. what's up man.

15
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:38.609
I hate to be that guy.

16
00:03:38.653 --> 00:03:41.482
I was the fool who did not pick
up smokes

17
00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:42.309
on my way home from work.

18
00:03:42.352 --> 00:03:43.788
would you mind if I...

19
00:03:43.832 --> 00:03:47.705
[helicopter engine roaring in a
distance]

20
00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:48.619
My contribution.

21
00:03:52.406 --> 00:03:54.277
- What is that the hope diamond.

22
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:55.365
- I think it is an ashtray.

23
00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:58.455
- You just moved in?

24
00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:01.763
- Yeah. like three or four
hours ago.

25
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.027
I'm leaving the city soon.

26
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.552
so I just basically packed up
all shit my at my old place.

27
00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:11.729
Sold it off there. found this
place.

28
00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:15.211
No lease. snatched it
up online. sight unseen.

29
00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:17.996
How long have you been here?

30
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.265
- I have an ex-husband
hence just started smoking.

31
00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:31.488
About a decade. which I guess
makes me

32
00:04:31.532 --> 00:04:33.882
the de facto ambassador
to the new tenants.

33
00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:35.666
- Does your ceiling have any
leaks?

34
00:04:36.537 --> 00:04:38.103
- Ruin any of your stuff?

35
00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:39.017
- Nothing to ruin.

36
00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:43.065
- Well my ex actually
left a bunch of stuff

37
00:04:43.108 --> 00:04:45.285
in the garage that I
was just gonna donate.

38
00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:46.808
If you want to have it for some
temporary

39
00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:49.201
like furnishings and stuff.

40
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:51.813
- Dude. that is really kind of
you.

41
00:04:51.856 --> 00:04:53.858
And I will actually take you up
on that.

42
00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:57.427
I would say let's just do it
now.

43
00:04:57.471 --> 00:05:00.517
but you directly ahead
off the surgery doctor.

44
00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:04.216
- Yeah. I'm a wedding
photographer

45
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.306
and I just fell asleep

46
00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.438
and might get up right
after the reception.

47
00:05:08.482 --> 00:05:13.574
There's this kind of Autumnal
equinox goth wedding.

48
00:05:13.617 --> 00:05:14.662
The thing is awesome about LA

49
00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:16.272
is there still is huge goth
scene.

50
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:19.667
So they we're just slinging
around cocktails all night

51
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.147
but started with blood and I
got hit.

52
00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:23.627
- I'm about to blow your mind.

53
00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:26.804
The bar I work at last night is
like

54
00:05:26.848 --> 00:05:31.940
the dark wave electro goth.

55
00:05:31.983 --> 00:05:33.028
I think. I dunno it looks like

56
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:34.159
so like the Renaissance Fair to
me.

57
00:05:34.203 --> 00:05:35.465
but I was wondering why I was
getting

58
00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.076
more bloodtinis spilled
all over me than usual.

59
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.861
And now I know.

60
00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:41.253
it is the. what'd you say?

61
00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:42.864
It was the autumn-in-al...

62
00:05:42.907 --> 00:05:44.256
- Autumnal. Autumnal equinox.

63
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.348
[helicopter engine roaring]

64
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:49.566
- Its when the weeds turn brown

65
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.872
and the hills burn and
everything smells

66
00:05:50.915 --> 00:05:53.396
like barbecue all the
time. it's beautiful.

67
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.311
- Oh shit. Check this out.

68
00:05:56.138 --> 00:05:57.966
Last night up on that hillside.

69
00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:00.403
I saw this guy.

70
00:06:04.146 --> 00:06:07.367
- LA is like Halloween.
but just all the time.

71
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.587
Is that your new place?

72
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.722
- Yeah. that's it.

73
00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:17.159
That's my temporary digs.

74
00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:20.118
- It's actually been
vacant since I moved in.

75
00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:21.772
So it's kinda nice

76
00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:24.514
to have somebody watching out
over us over the neighborhood.

77
00:06:24.558 --> 00:06:27.169
It's getting worse. Vagrants.

78
00:06:27.212 --> 00:06:29.824
- It's been vacant for over a
decade?

79
00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:32.174
Someone like murdered there or
something?

80
00:06:33.088 --> 00:06:34.045
Well that's supposed to have
something

81
00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:34.872
disclosed to me. what's up?

82
00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:36.439
- Actually. yeah.

83
00:06:36.483 --> 00:06:37.875
A 90-year old grandma just
threw grandpa out of a window

84
00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.356
and he fell face first.
right where you're standing.

85
00:06:41.923 --> 00:06:45.405
[airplane engine roaring]

86
00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:48.843
- At least we are cheap
right to the airport.

87
00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:53.282
- There is this

88
00:06:53.325 --> 00:06:56.024
dude sits at my bar and
he always says this thing.

89
00:06:56.067 --> 00:06:58.461
He says. "Hey. it can only fall
so fast."

90
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.682
[John chuckling]

91
00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:03.684
I hope what that dude said
to me is going fast enough

92
00:07:03.727 --> 00:07:04.902
to not feel the impact.

93
00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:10.952
- Oh no. I made that up.

94
00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:12.388
No one died. I was just kidding.

95
00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.564
Anyways. I got to get these bad
boys.

96
00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:16.740
Motor checked and charged
before church.

97
00:07:16.784 --> 00:07:18.481
So why don't you just swing on
by

98
00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:21.702
when you want to move in your
stuff.

99
00:07:21.745 --> 00:07:25.662
- Oh. here I go. bad neighbor.
I am John.

100
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.930
- Oh. Levi. All right.

101
00:07:32.974 --> 00:07:34.366
Hey. thank you for this.

102
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.545
- Check it out. That's hungry
Dave.

103
00:07:40.198 --> 00:07:41.286
He is really aggressive.

104
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.940
Don't let him get to eye level.
Okay?

105
00:07:44.638 --> 00:07:47.423
[wind whistling]

106
00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:03.395
[bells tingling gently]

107
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:07.182
[static noise]

108
00:08:19.237 --> 00:08:22.110
[ominous music]

109
00:08:22.153 --> 00:08:23.546
- What do I think went wrong.

110
00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:27.550
either one of two things
happened.

111
00:08:27.594 --> 00:08:29.770
Either they were trying to put
together

112
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:33.904
this really intricate.
beautiful cosmic puzzle.

113
00:08:33.948 --> 00:08:36.124
And some of those pieces
were extraordinary

114
00:08:37.647 --> 00:08:41.956
or the way they jammed them
together.

115
00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:43.566
It just created this abstract
mess

116
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.350
that then they could imbue

117
00:08:45.394 --> 00:08:46.743
with whatever meaning they
wanted.

118
00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:48.049
It doesn't really matter

119
00:08:48.092 --> 00:08:51.574
because it affected them
in very different ways.

120
00:08:51.618 --> 00:08:55.186
And I don't think anything
is worth what happened.

121
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.362
I still believe part of it was
real.

122
00:08:57.406 --> 00:08:59.451
You can catch it in scientific
terms.

123
00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:03.064
it doesn't really matter
because the result is the same.

124
00:09:03.978 --> 00:09:05.501
And it's really sad.

125
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.199
[ominous music]

126
00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:12.116
I don't just mean the dead one.

127
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.902
- And there is this yellow tail.

128
00:09:14.945 --> 00:09:18.427
but between me and it's like

129
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.082
this little like cavernous
that has some eel grass on it.

130
00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:24.085
- And it's like 19th century
lobster trap

131
00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:25.826
that just busted out of it.
right?

132
00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:28.872
And then... boom.

133
00:09:28.916 --> 00:09:31.919
I looked down. there's a
fucking claw around my arm.

134
00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:33.573
I look up. there's a lobster

135
00:09:33.616 --> 00:09:35.923
the size of Danny fucking
DeVito.

136
00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:37.359
I kid you not.

137
00:09:37.402 --> 00:09:38.708
And he's dragging me

138
00:09:38.752 --> 00:09:39.796
and I'm so fascinated

139
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.363
but then I look in it's eyes

140
00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:44.453
that I almost forget I'm loaded

141
00:09:44.496 --> 00:09:45.889
and I can shoot left-handed.

142
00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:52.504
Just take aim and shtoonk.
spear the shit out of it.

143
00:09:52.548 --> 00:09:53.810
Barely phases it.

144
00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:57.074
Just kind of saunters
off back into its cave.

145
00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:59.599
I've never seen that lobster
again.

146
00:09:59.642 --> 00:10:01.252
I never saw that spear again.

147
00:10:01.296 --> 00:10:02.863
I didn't get that big ass tuna.

148
00:10:02.906 --> 00:10:05.256
but that was the day I
learned that it's like.

149
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.258
yeah. there's a lot of good
sushi places in Los Angeles.

150
00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:08.825
but I don't fuck with lobster
rolls.

151
00:10:08.869 --> 00:10:11.306
Lobsters are intelligent
creatures.

152
00:10:11.349 --> 00:10:13.177
- You can hop on my wifi
network if you want to.

153
00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:15.049
- My signal is shockingly good
here.

154
00:10:15.092 --> 00:10:17.355
but I might take you up on that.

155
00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.792
What is your network?

156
00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:20.576
- It's "Behold the promised LAN"

157
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.145
like L-A-N. it used to be
Mr. Rogers neighborhertz.

158
00:10:24.188 --> 00:10:26.060
but that was Lonnie's.

159
00:10:26.103 --> 00:10:27.496
It is not even clever.

160
00:10:27.539 --> 00:10:28.628
Oh. the password is easy to
remember.

161
00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:30.368
It's "JUDGEMENT DAY" all caps.

162
00:10:30.412 --> 00:10:33.023
- There's like a billion
fucking networks.

163
00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:34.938
So I'm gonna have to mess with
this later.

164
00:10:34.982 --> 00:10:37.288
But now I actually have to
get to this charity thing

165
00:10:37.332 --> 00:10:40.074
I do at the youth shelter.

166
00:10:40.117 --> 00:10:41.423
Can I grab you something for
the way out?

167
00:10:41.466 --> 00:10:42.642
Like a beer or something?

168
00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:44.339
I really appreciate all this.

169
00:10:44.382 --> 00:10:45.166
- No. thank you.

170
00:10:45.209 --> 00:10:46.254
Actually. I don't drink.

171
00:10:48.735 --> 00:10:49.779
- Good for you. bro.

172
00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:51.259
How long have you been sober?

173
00:10:52.564 --> 00:10:54.566
- Now 10 years. honestly.
Lonnie was an AA.

174
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.526
So that kinda made me an AA.
but never even had a problem.

175
00:10:57.569 --> 00:11:00.660
I just kinda got way into it.

176
00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:02.705
Stuck with it. I don't know.

177
00:11:02.749 --> 00:11:03.575
- Okay. cool.

178
00:11:04.707 --> 00:11:05.708
Don't forget your plant. on the
way out.

179
00:11:05.752 --> 00:11:07.101
- Oh no. no that's yours.

180
00:11:07.144 --> 00:11:08.189
That's actually a house warming
gift.

181
00:11:08.232 --> 00:11:10.626
My grandma runs this little
nursery

182
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.671
up in the central valley.

183
00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:12.672
I give her a hand with
sometimes.

184
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.761
[phone ringing]

185
00:11:14.804 --> 00:11:16.371
Speak of the angel.

186
00:11:16.414 --> 00:11:18.895
- [John] Hey actually. do you
mind if I take this up here.

187
00:11:18.939 --> 00:11:20.854
- Disappears in the courtyard.

188
00:11:20.897 --> 00:11:22.072
- And do what you gotta do.

189
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.640
- Hey grandma.

190
00:11:28.122 --> 00:11:29.297
I could probably just head on up

191
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.690
there next Sunday. like usual.
you know.

192
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.131
Yeah. I of course will groom
myself and wear a suit.

193
00:11:37.174 --> 00:11:39.133
Not just for God. but for you.

194
00:11:39.176 --> 00:11:42.266
All right. amen to that.

195
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.269
All right. may you go. I love
you. Bye.

196
00:11:48.142 --> 00:11:51.841
She's out of her mind. man. See
you.

197
00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:54.975
- Can I interest you in?

198
00:11:55.018 --> 00:11:55.889
One for the road.

199
00:11:58.674 --> 00:12:00.154
- Yeah. Thank you.

200
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.734
[soft wind whistling]

201
00:12:31.663 --> 00:12:34.318
[ominous music]

202
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.762
[wind whistling]

203
00:12:47.897 --> 00:12:50.595
- Did you forget something?

204
00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:53.642
- You should just come and see
this.

205
00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:01.781
[ominous music]

206
00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:17.057
- It was moving on its own

207
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.059
or something invisible was
moving it.

208
00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:21.409
There was a this light.

209
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.416
- Yeah. no. absolutely.

210
00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:32.550
No doubt. I feel bad about this.

211
00:13:32.594 --> 00:13:35.902
I actually do have to
get to my charity thing

212
00:13:35.945 --> 00:13:38.513
at the youth shelter. but
I don't want to rush you.

213
00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:40.776
- Totally. Yeah. What are we
gonna do?

214
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.038
Or we're gonna like stand
around all day

215
00:13:42.082 --> 00:13:43.866
and talk about how I thought I
saw a ghost

216
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.302
in a new apartment.

217
00:13:45.346 --> 00:13:48.131
I'm sorry. I'm the weirdest
neighbor you knew ever.

218
00:13:48.175 --> 00:13:50.177
And don't be a stranger.

219
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.875
[ominous music]

220
00:14:01.753 --> 00:14:04.844
[crystal clattering]

221
00:14:07.934 --> 00:14:10.588
[ominous music]

222
00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:27.518
[door banging]

223
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.611
[diminishing invigorating music]

224
00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:38.660
- That's so dumb.

225
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.793
- No. it's just weird.

226
00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:44.361
It's like you go your whole
life thinking certain things

227
00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:45.928
are always gonna be a mystery.

228
00:14:45.972 --> 00:14:47.930
Like the identity of Jack the
Ripper

229
00:14:47.974 --> 00:14:51.934
or Bermuda triangle or the
great pyramids.

230
00:14:51.978 --> 00:14:53.762
- Pyramids aren't a mystery
anymore.

231
00:14:53.805 --> 00:14:54.981
I saw this YouTube video

232
00:14:55.024 --> 00:14:57.113
and they're just ramps in wet
sand.

233
00:14:58.723 --> 00:15:00.725
- All right. Well. a lot of
things are still mysteries.

234
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:02.945
You just don't expect to witness
one on a shitty afternoon

235
00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:04.425
in your cheap apartment.

236
00:15:04.468 --> 00:15:06.166
- We are more surveilled
than ever in our own history.

237
00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:07.732
Everyone has a camera
phone in their pocket

238
00:15:07.776 --> 00:15:10.387
and we still don't have
even a single actual bit

239
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:15.392
of evidence for a ghost
or supernatural. whatever.

240
00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:17.438
[ominous music]

241
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:18.918
Man. there it is.

242
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:24.184
It's right there.

243
00:15:24.227 --> 00:15:26.664
- It's weird though. I
don't necessarily feel.

244
00:15:28.188 --> 00:15:29.276
[ominous music]

245
00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:30.277
Do you feel scared?

246
00:15:31.887 --> 00:15:33.106
- When it was happening.

247
00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:35.108
when we're looking at it. I
really did.

248
00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:41.897
but it's getting replaced by
something.

249
00:15:43.072 --> 00:15:44.030
- All right. this is gonna
sound weird

250
00:15:44.073 --> 00:15:45.335
because you and me just met

251
00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:48.643
but when I first moved out to
LA.

252
00:15:48.686 --> 00:15:50.732
you get a job bar backing.

253
00:15:50.775 --> 00:15:54.257
And one of my first days
I'm polishing a glass

254
00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:56.390
and this dude behind the bar is
like.

255
00:15:56.433 --> 00:15:58.653
"Hey. how long are you gonna
give it?"

256
00:15:58.696 --> 00:16:01.743
Like. how long am I gonna give
it to strike gold out west?

257
00:16:01.786 --> 00:16:02.700
And I tell him.

258
00:16:04.615 --> 00:16:06.617
actually what do you think I
told him?

259
00:16:08.054 --> 00:16:09.446
- 39 Years.

260
00:16:12.536 --> 00:16:15.626
- I said 10 but it ended up
being 20.

261
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.064
And I'm still driving
the same shitty Mazda.

262
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.546
to the same bar. except my
kidneys hurt.

263
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:25.810
I am self medicating and
pretty sure my liver is shot.

264
00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:27.987
All right. so like photography.
right?

265
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.641
Like that was supposed
to be your golden egg.

266
00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:32.861
The thing you're passionate
about.

267
00:16:32.904 --> 00:16:33.993
the thing that allows
you to make a living.

268
00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:36.517
but it hasn't worked out for
you yet.

269
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.347
Life tons of things like that.
dude. tons.

270
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.045
Life's weird. Like sometimes
things just don't happen.

271
00:16:43.089 --> 00:16:45.178
but that happened. right?

272
00:16:46.092 --> 00:16:47.702
And that's more scarce than
gold.

273
00:16:47.745 --> 00:16:49.878
It's like proof of the
supernatural.

274
00:16:49.921 --> 00:16:52.794
That's like. book deals and
like movies

275
00:16:52.837 --> 00:16:56.145
and like TV shows and like
religious views

276
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:57.886
and shit getting.

277
00:17:02.499 --> 00:17:04.197
- So what do we do?

278
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.156
[knocking on the door]

279
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.027
- Hello?

280
00:17:11.117 --> 00:17:12.466
Hello.

281
00:17:12.509 --> 00:17:13.641
- Hello.

282
00:17:13.684 --> 00:17:17.166
[airplane engine roaring]

283
00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:22.041
- Oh Jesus.

284
00:17:27.176 --> 00:17:28.960
- So. the house I grew up in.

285
00:17:29.004 --> 00:17:30.005
had this big ass windows.

286
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.702
the pigeons could not see.

287
00:17:31.746 --> 00:17:33.139
they just slam into it.

288
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.402
And you can't tell at first.

289
00:17:35.445 --> 00:17:36.968
whether they are just like
stunned

290
00:17:37.012 --> 00:17:38.709
or their brains are mush.

291
00:17:38.753 --> 00:17:41.582
we build these things
and it protects them.

292
00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:43.758
So they don't get eaten by like
a cat

293
00:17:43.801 --> 00:17:46.413
and shit while we wait to
see if they wake up or not.

294
00:17:46.456 --> 00:17:48.502
- Oh. we will never get the
full effect of it on a podcast.

295
00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:50.721
- What?

296
00:17:50.765 --> 00:17:51.983
- We're gonna try to
prove the supernatural.

297
00:17:52.027 --> 00:17:54.116
We're gonna need some kind of
visuals.

298
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.378
People won't believe it.

299
00:17:57.032 --> 00:17:58.860
- What are you thinking like a
YouTube channel or something?

300
00:17:58.903 --> 00:18:00.122
- YouTube is like a whole like
subscriber.

301
00:18:00.166 --> 00:18:02.820
metadata algorithm. hot girl
thumbnail.

302
00:18:02.864 --> 00:18:03.952
like channel subscribe.

303
00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:06.302
I don't understand YouTube.

304
00:18:13.788 --> 00:18:16.182
I was thinking a documentary.

305
00:18:19.402 --> 00:18:23.928
- All right. Well. I actually
do have to run to work now.

306
00:18:23.972 --> 00:18:26.844
but I don't think I work
tomorrow night.

307
00:18:26.888 --> 00:18:29.108
If you wanted to reconvene
then get it started.

308
00:18:30.457 --> 00:18:31.719
- Yeah. let's do it.

309
00:18:32.807 --> 00:18:33.808
- All right.

310
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:38.204
[Levi groaning]

311
00:18:41.294 --> 00:18:43.818
Is it possible this is
extremely dangerous

312
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:46.081
and we just completely
overlooked that part?

313
00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:53.480
- No one's ever died of like a
demon or a ghost or whatever.

314
00:18:53.523 --> 00:18:57.136
It's always just slamming
cabinets and doors

315
00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:59.964
and like cold spots and stuff.

316
00:19:00.008 --> 00:19:02.358
- Totally. So if it gets
dangerous. we just stop.

317
00:19:02.402 --> 00:19:03.707
Easy. right?

318
00:19:03.751 --> 00:19:04.882
I'll see you then.

319
00:19:04.926 --> 00:19:06.188
Can you take care of that

320
00:19:06.232 --> 00:19:07.450
to put somewhere safe on
the side of the house.

321
00:19:08.843 --> 00:19:13.848
Hey. hi. So sorry. I did
not make it to the thing.

322
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.418
- Yeah. First I did find
it a little bit strange

323
00:19:18.461 --> 00:19:20.376
that the youth shelter
that Levi volunteers

324
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.465
that would send somebody to
check on him

325
00:19:22.509 --> 00:19:24.337
when he doesn't show up. but...

326
00:19:25.425 --> 00:19:26.991
- [Isabel] I'm sorry.

327
00:19:27.035 --> 00:19:30.212
I think your bio was in one
of the destroyed hard drives.

328
00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:33.172
Maybe let's get that first.
Okay?

329
00:19:33.215 --> 00:19:34.782
- Yeah. Okay.

330
00:19:34.825 --> 00:19:36.262
- [Levi] Just because this feels
a little bit weird is okay.

331
00:19:36.305 --> 00:19:37.698
If I just look at you.

332
00:19:37.741 --> 00:19:39.265
I know John likes it like this.

333
00:19:39.308 --> 00:19:41.441
but you could just.

334
00:19:41.484 --> 00:19:43.965
- [John] I started out with
photography

335
00:19:44.008 --> 00:19:45.445
and I thought a better way

336
00:19:45.488 --> 00:19:47.751
to finance photography was
to become a math teacher.

337
00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:49.144
I thought it'd be more chill.

338
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.754
I thought I'll be the cool
teacher.

339
00:19:51.842 --> 00:19:53.017
but those kids they just hated
me.

340
00:19:53.061 --> 00:19:54.367
Even though I adjusted the
curve so much.

341
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.282
I should've been fired.

342
00:19:56.325 --> 00:20:00.547
Some people. they like
kids. but they are not good.

343
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.202
Anyways. I fell in love with
Lonnie

344
00:20:03.245 --> 00:20:05.639
and chased him out here to LA.

345
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.991
Now I spend my days and
nights charging scooters.

346
00:20:10.034 --> 00:20:12.994
and I hope that the rent check
clears

347
00:20:13.037 --> 00:20:14.865
so that I'm not moving in with
my grandma

348
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:16.084
when I'm in my thirties.

349
00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.043
Move on to the

350
00:20:19.087 --> 00:20:19.914
convict thing?

351
00:20:21.437 --> 00:20:22.917
- [Levi] I mean. I think the
reason why I got into this

352
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.313
with John was that I just
loved watching X Files with

353
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:30.011
my sister I was little.

354
00:20:30.054 --> 00:20:33.057
Now it's like everything
like the X Files I guess.

355
00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:35.364
- [John] Even though Levi
played it off really well.

356
00:20:35.408 --> 00:20:38.193
I knew something about that guy
was...

357
00:20:39.063 --> 00:20:42.241
[soft soothing music]

358
00:20:43.416 --> 00:20:45.635
You know I'll say this.

359
00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:48.464
I can totally see why he
wouldn't want to share like
that.

360
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.208
[ominous music]

361
00:21:21.367 --> 00:21:22.629
Hey. careful with the threading
on

362
00:21:22.672 --> 00:21:23.978
that thing it's kinda old.

363
00:21:27.764 --> 00:21:28.809
Is your phone okay?

364
00:21:28.852 --> 00:21:29.897
- Yeah. I'm all good.

365
00:21:32.552 --> 00:21:35.685
- God. all that heat just
coming from the closet?

366
00:21:35.729 --> 00:21:37.992
- Yeah. it is hot as shit.

367
00:21:38.906 --> 00:21:43.345
I have this theory that the
downstairs unit is vacant

368
00:21:43.389 --> 00:21:45.434
and maybe like someone left on
a heater

369
00:21:45.478 --> 00:21:49.525
or how kind of sweet would
ghost fire be?

370
00:21:49.569 --> 00:21:52.398
- Yeah. how much do you
think like Netflix pays

371
00:21:52.441 --> 00:21:54.051
for one of these documentaries.

372
00:21:54.095 --> 00:21:55.314
Let's say about movies selling

373
00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:58.099
at film festivals for millions
of dollars.

374
00:21:58.142 --> 00:22:00.101
So I would say at least like 10
million.

375
00:22:00.144 --> 00:22:01.407
something like that.

376
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:03.844
- Honestly. that sounds kind of
low.

377
00:22:04.758 --> 00:22:07.674
Oh. hey. I know it's a
little early for this.

378
00:22:07.717 --> 00:22:10.459
but I was thinking a
little bit about the title.

379
00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:12.548
All right. check this out.

380
00:22:13.767 --> 00:22:16.422
"Something in the light."

381
00:22:19.947 --> 00:22:20.774
Isn't that cool?

382
00:22:23.516 --> 00:22:24.604
I get it.

383
00:22:24.647 --> 00:22:26.257
- Yeah. because of the fucking
light.

384
00:22:27.563 --> 00:22:29.348
That's dope. I thought of one
too.

385
00:22:42.448 --> 00:22:44.624
"The door that wouldn't shut."

386
00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:46.669
[door cringing]

387
00:22:46.713 --> 00:22:47.540
- For the title?

388
00:22:49.759 --> 00:22:51.065
That's cool.

389
00:22:51.108 --> 00:22:51.935
- Thank you.

390
00:22:56.766 --> 00:22:59.029
- It's probably got too
syllables
though. you know. Right?

391
00:23:01.728 --> 00:23:04.644
[camera shuttering]

392
00:23:04.687 --> 00:23:06.472
- I'm pretty sure that's almost

393
00:23:06.515 --> 00:23:09.649
the exact same amount of.
what was the other one?

394
00:23:09.692 --> 00:23:11.694
- It's got one more syllable.

395
00:23:11.738 --> 00:23:13.000
It's hard to remember.

396
00:23:13.043 --> 00:23:15.176
So titles are important.

397
00:23:17.613 --> 00:23:20.964
[footsteps diminishing]

398
00:23:27.884 --> 00:23:30.321
[TV hissing]

399
00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:40.114
[air whooshing]

400
00:23:47.774 --> 00:23:49.602
- [John] Praise Jesus.

401
00:23:50.516 --> 00:23:53.170
[air whooshing]

402
00:24:05.095 --> 00:24:08.011
[crystal clanking]

403
00:24:08.055 --> 00:24:10.492
I guess that waits for you for
that part.

404
00:24:10.536 --> 00:24:13.364
[crystal beeping]

405
00:24:15.541 --> 00:24:18.239
You rolling? You rolling?

406
00:24:18.282 --> 00:24:19.545
- Oh shit.

407
00:24:19.588 --> 00:24:22.025
[rapid beeping]

408
00:24:22.069 --> 00:24:23.200
- Wait.

409
00:24:23.244 --> 00:24:26.377
[camera beeping]

410
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:30.425
Fuck. Camera overheated
and the SD card was full.

411
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:32.427
So we couldn't have
gotten anything anyways.

412
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:34.081
- I might've gotten
something on the film camera.

413
00:24:34.124 --> 00:24:36.997
but I doubt it and I didn't
charge the batteries.

414
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.260
So welcome to amateur hour.

415
00:24:39.303 --> 00:24:41.610
- Dude. I feel like if you
get anything on day one.

416
00:24:41.654 --> 00:24:42.611
that's a win.

417
00:24:42.655 --> 00:24:43.830
- We didn't get anything.

418
00:24:43.873 --> 00:24:46.397
Your camera was completely out
of focus.

419
00:24:46.441 --> 00:24:47.747
- I don't think it was.

420
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.532
And also I just feel
like this is an indicator

421
00:24:50.576 --> 00:24:54.623
that we need a better
plan. better equipment.

422
00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:57.583
real cameras. real
lighting. real microphones.

423
00:24:57.626 --> 00:24:58.845
- This is real.

424
00:24:58.888 --> 00:25:00.324
- No. but I mean like
professional stuff.

425
00:25:00.368 --> 00:25:01.674
like when you see politicians

426
00:25:01.717 --> 00:25:04.024
and they got all microphones
on their collars.

427
00:25:04.067 --> 00:25:05.939
We should like divvy up tasks.

428
00:25:05.982 --> 00:25:08.289
Like you be the main camera guy

429
00:25:08.332 --> 00:25:10.030
and I'll be the supplementary
camera guy.

430
00:25:10.073 --> 00:25:11.901
I could do all the audio stuff.

431
00:25:11.945 --> 00:25:16.427
And you could do like
the video organizing.

432
00:25:16.471 --> 00:25:17.428
- Data manager.

433
00:25:17.472 --> 00:25:18.647
- Data entry. Exactly.

434
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.477
And obviously we don't know
when exactly

435
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:23.565
this thing's happening.

436
00:25:23.609 --> 00:25:25.524
We're probably going to take
shifts.

437
00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:28.091
So. here you go.

438
00:25:29.745 --> 00:25:30.920
Remember to lock up.

439
00:25:30.964 --> 00:25:33.575
remember to leave all the
windows open.

440
00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:34.750
So you don't fucking cook us.

441
00:25:34.794 --> 00:25:35.838
- You know this is how stupid
people

442
00:25:35.882 --> 00:25:37.536
get murdered on "Dateline."
right?

443
00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.799
- You're gonna murder me?

444
00:25:43.498 --> 00:25:45.413
- No one's getting murdered.

445
00:25:45.456 --> 00:25:47.197
And ghosts can't kill you
either.

446
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:48.416
- You keep saying that.

447
00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:51.854
but you're not Dana Fox or
Mulder Scully.

448
00:25:51.898 --> 00:25:52.986
- How do you think a ghost
kills someone.

449
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:54.422
It has a ghost knife?

450
00:25:54.465 --> 00:25:56.729
They just like pull out their
ghost shank

451
00:25:56.772 --> 00:25:58.600
and they stab you and ghost
pre...

452
00:25:58.644 --> 00:25:59.775
What is that?

453
00:25:59.819 --> 00:26:01.342
- It's just like an energy
supplement.

454
00:26:01.385 --> 00:26:03.126
I get out this nutropics
website.

455
00:26:05.738 --> 00:26:06.565
- Are they safe?

456
00:26:08.958 --> 00:26:11.439
- Yeah. it's just like a
all natural amino acids.

457
00:26:12.658 --> 00:26:15.312
[ominous music]

458
00:26:29.196 --> 00:26:32.591

[diminishing soft music]

460
00:27:04.884 --> 00:27:06.929
- Kind of hard to explain.

461
00:27:06.973 --> 00:27:08.539
but yeah. I mean. I'm kind of
an idiot.

462
00:27:08.583 --> 00:27:10.759
I was supposed to do
something with him tonight.

463
00:27:10.803 --> 00:27:12.631
but I forgot to get his contact
info

464
00:27:12.674 --> 00:27:13.719
and he's not home so.

465
00:27:16.852 --> 00:27:18.201
Grandma you're genius.

466
00:27:19.942 --> 00:27:22.902
Yeah. He's gotta be on some
kind of social media somewhere.

467
00:27:24.207 --> 00:27:26.862
[ominous music]

468
00:27:28.734 --> 00:27:33.608
Sorry. Yeah. I'll call you back
later on.

469
00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:34.478
I love you. Bye.

470
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.663
[banging on door]

471
00:27:49.189 --> 00:27:50.059
- What's up man.

472
00:27:50.103 --> 00:27:51.147
Oh. they make me dress like this

473
00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:52.322
for like the speakeasy and shit.

474
00:27:52.366 --> 00:27:53.541
it fucking sucks.

475
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.326
Did I get the right hard drives?

476
00:27:57.327 --> 00:27:58.851
Dope. I actually.

477
00:27:58.894 --> 00:28:00.287
I picked up a high decibel
camera right next to my work.

478
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.984
So. I have that too.

479
00:28:02.855 --> 00:28:04.813
Did you get the gear?

480
00:28:06.075 --> 00:28:07.250
- Yeah.

481
00:28:07.294 --> 00:28:08.643
- Awesome. Okay.

482
00:28:09.644 --> 00:28:11.080
Are we're gonna do this or...

483
00:28:13.779 --> 00:28:14.649
- Yeah.

484
00:28:16.042 --> 00:28:17.608
- And the gear?

485
00:28:17.652 --> 00:28:18.479
- Yeah.

486
00:28:20.263 --> 00:28:22.918

[camera stand falling]

490
00:29:07.528 --> 00:29:10.792
- Hey John. I know I said I
could do this.

491
00:29:10.836 --> 00:29:13.142
but I was incorrect.

492
00:29:13.186 --> 00:29:15.101
Do you mind helping me out.

493
00:29:18.452 --> 00:29:19.279
Thanks bud.

494
00:29:21.107 --> 00:29:22.717
This camera's basically
what I was talking about

495
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:24.937
in terms of a bigger thing and
actually never told you this.

496
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.155
I was gonna buy a bunch

497
00:29:26.199 --> 00:29:27.896
of camera equipment several
years back.

498
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.028
but someone told me my tips
would up

499
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:31.508
to like 20 to 40% if I fixed my
teeth.

500
00:29:31.552 --> 00:29:33.815
So I got braces. spent
all the money on that.

501
00:29:33.859 --> 00:29:36.165
Didn't get the camera
equipment. check this out.

502
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:41.518
- You are on the audio.

503
00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:43.956
- Was I supposed to?

504
00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:44.826
- I already got it.

505
00:29:47.481 --> 00:29:52.051
- So. are you being weird
because we forgot to run audio?

506
00:29:52.094 --> 00:29:54.009
- The other day in front of our
place.

507
00:29:55.097 --> 00:29:56.620
Who was that?

508
00:29:56.664 --> 00:29:59.623
- That was my probation
counselor.

509
00:29:59.667 --> 00:30:02.191
I told you I've got the charity
thing

510
00:30:02.235 --> 00:30:03.584
I do at the youth shelter

511
00:30:03.627 --> 00:30:04.933
and they just get really
weird when I don't show up

512
00:30:04.977 --> 00:30:06.021
or I'm late or anything.

513
00:30:06.065 --> 00:30:07.414
- You know that everyone would
say

514
00:30:07.457 --> 00:30:09.329
there's a huge difference
between volunteer work

515
00:30:09.372 --> 00:30:10.765
and mandatory community service.

516
00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:12.114
- I don't want to get
caught up in the weeds

517
00:30:12.158 --> 00:30:15.552
of what exactly that's called.

518
00:30:15.596 --> 00:30:17.206
- You want to tell me what
you did to get yourself a PO.

519
00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.514
- It is a not an interesting
story. not even worth telling.

520
00:30:25.867 --> 00:30:30.829
So you read online that I'm
a registered sex offender.

521
00:30:35.007 --> 00:30:35.877
- What?

522
00:30:35.921 --> 00:30:38.227
- I was having to go cocktails.

523
00:30:38.271 --> 00:30:40.795
during one of the big city-wide
shutdowns

524
00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:42.362
and I had to piss really bad.

525
00:30:42.405 --> 00:30:45.582
There were literally no
restrooms open anywhere.

526
00:30:45.626 --> 00:30:48.934
I see this alley. I go back
there I am relieving myself

527
00:30:48.977 --> 00:30:49.891
and the next thing I know.

528
00:30:49.935 --> 00:30:51.197
I'm pissing all over my shoes

529
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.372
because the cop handcuffed...

530
00:30:52.415 --> 00:30:53.503
[bottle breaking]

531
00:30:53.547 --> 00:30:55.070
That was the wall of a daycare
center.

532
00:30:55.114 --> 00:30:57.464
A closed daycare center.

533
00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:02.034
- Is that true?

534
00:31:02.077 --> 00:31:04.210
- Yeah. It's true.

535
00:31:04.253 --> 00:31:05.515
I mean you can look up the
court record

536
00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:06.690
that those things are really
dry.

537
00:31:06.734 --> 00:31:08.344
And I just gave the cliff notes
version

538
00:31:08.388 --> 00:31:10.042
and it's really hard to defend
yourself

539
00:31:10.085 --> 00:31:13.828
against pedophilia allegations
wearing a fucking bow tie.

540
00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.581
[soft humming]

541
00:31:38.418 --> 00:31:41.421
[TV humming softly]

542
00:31:53.346 --> 00:31:54.869
- We are rolling?

543
00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:55.957
- Yeah. we are rolling.

544
00:31:58.873 --> 00:32:01.702
[camera clicking]

545
00:32:04.879 --> 00:32:08.230
When I was younger I did
this thing called geocaching.

546
00:32:08.274 --> 00:32:09.536
It's kind of like scavenger
hunting.

547
00:32:09.579 --> 00:32:11.059
but for adults with the GPS

548
00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:17.239
and 10 or 20 years ago I found
this book

549
00:32:17.283 --> 00:32:19.372
and it was really cool

550
00:32:19.415 --> 00:32:21.722
kind of pseudoscience coffee
table book.

551
00:32:21.765 --> 00:32:23.854
It's called the "Geometry of
Magnetism."

552
00:32:25.117 --> 00:32:27.771
And it's written in like
Esperanto

553
00:32:27.815 --> 00:32:29.686
and the author's name was
redacted.

554
00:32:32.254 --> 00:32:37.259
I swear to you. that symbol
is on the cover of my book.

555
00:32:40.523 --> 00:32:43.613
- What? That's not very ghost
like.

556
00:32:43.657 --> 00:32:44.484
- No.

557
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.402
Do I seem okay?

558
00:32:52.796 --> 00:32:53.580
- I don't know.

559
00:32:53.623 --> 00:32:54.450
I don't know you.

560
00:32:54.494 --> 00:32:56.017
- No. I mean. do I seem like

561
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:58.150
I'm having some kind of a
psychotic break?

562
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.589
- No. psychotic breaks
are totally different.

563
00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:09.639
[soft wind whistling]

564
00:33:09.683 --> 00:33:12.338
- If you're a ghost. do
something.

565
00:33:14.383 --> 00:33:17.560
[soft wind whistling]

566
00:33:18.431 --> 00:33:20.346
Do something different.

567
00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.787
I mean. we don't actually have
any reason

568
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.224
to think that this is a
ghost or a Poltergeist.

569
00:33:29.268 --> 00:33:31.835
It's the first of movies
or books that you've read.

570
00:33:33.359 --> 00:33:34.621
We might have this all wrong.

571
00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:38.712
- So what is it?

572
00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:41.976
- That's the question?

573
00:33:44.326 --> 00:33:48.156
[resonant rejuvenating music]

574
00:33:55.163 --> 00:33:56.164
The symbol that's on my book

575
00:33:56.208 --> 00:33:58.514
and that was on that refraction.

576
00:33:58.558 --> 00:34:01.126
I swear to God. I've also been
seeing it all over the city.

577
00:34:03.258 --> 00:34:07.088
[resonant rejuvenating music]

578
00:34:08.611 --> 00:34:11.527
Look. all of this is the EM
spectrum.

579
00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:14.617
ElectroMagnetic spectrum.
it's radio waves on up

580
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:17.751
to the visible light and
this is using derivatives

581
00:34:17.794 --> 00:34:19.405
to find acceleration of
velocity.

582
00:34:19.448 --> 00:34:21.711
but look the value for gravity
is wrong.

583
00:34:21.755 --> 00:34:23.974
They just changed it. And
I don't really know why.

584
00:34:24.018 --> 00:34:25.933
And then this is a ratio

585
00:34:25.976 --> 00:34:27.848
that's kind of like pi.

586
00:34:27.891 --> 00:34:29.328
which people call them golden
ratio.

587
00:34:29.371 --> 00:34:32.113
- Are we quoting Dan
Brown books right now?

588
00:34:32.157 --> 00:34:33.506
- What?

589
00:34:33.549 --> 00:34:34.724
- I'm not making it a
Divinci Code documentary.

590
00:34:34.768 --> 00:34:37.466
- No. Jesus. no. it's just a
ratio.

591
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:40.295
It's not exactly the
Fibonacci sequence or phi

592
00:34:40.339 --> 00:34:41.470
or the golden ratio or whatever.

593
00:34:41.514 --> 00:34:42.863
It's just an irrational number

594
00:34:42.906 --> 00:34:44.386
with infinite decimals out to
infinity.

595
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:46.475
There are millions of
irrational numbers.

596
00:34:46.519 --> 00:34:49.130
This is common in the world and
in math.

597
00:34:49.174 --> 00:34:52.133
And it has something
to do with a rectangle.

598
00:34:52.177 --> 00:34:53.961
that when it's expressed as a
ratio.

599
00:34:54.004 --> 00:34:56.181
it is that irrational number.

600
00:34:56.224 --> 00:34:57.791
I don't know what it means
either.

601
00:35:00.185 --> 00:35:01.708
- This has nothing to
do with nautilus shells

602
00:35:01.751 --> 00:35:03.057
the Grail or Stonehenge?

603
00:35:05.015 --> 00:35:08.497
[airplane engine roaring]

604
00:35:10.151 --> 00:35:13.459
[electric static noise]

605
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:17.463
- Everything we've seen so far.

606
00:35:17.506 --> 00:35:19.117
It's either been on

607
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.858
the EM spectrum visible
light. radio waves or...

608
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:28.778
[resonant rejuvenating music]

609
00:35:28.822 --> 00:35:29.649
Gravity.

610
00:35:30.476 --> 00:35:34.306
[resonant rejuvenating music]

611
00:35:45.317 --> 00:35:47.101
- Okay. So it's like.

612
00:35:48.058 --> 00:35:49.234
There is one for gravity

613
00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:51.758
and there's one for electrical
shock.

614
00:35:51.801 --> 00:35:52.802
- Electromagnetism.

615
00:35:52.846 --> 00:35:53.847
- Right. yeah.

616
00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.283
- Maybe there's two of them.

617
00:35:56.241 --> 00:35:57.111
- Two what?

618
00:36:02.029 --> 00:36:03.639
Man. I hope the neighbors are
all right?

619
00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:06.599
- I heard there was a murder.

620
00:36:07.469 --> 00:36:09.906
- Hey. I keep having this
thought.

621
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:10.733
Mind giving me a light really
quick?

622
00:36:10.777 --> 00:36:11.604
- I got you.

623
00:36:12.518 --> 00:36:13.345
- Jesus.

624
00:36:16.826 --> 00:36:18.088
Okay.

625
00:36:18.132 --> 00:36:20.917
Here you go. Don't
forget you get to inhale.

626
00:36:20.961 --> 00:36:24.094
- When we first met. you said
this phrase.

627
00:36:24.138 --> 00:36:27.402
it was. "You can only fall so
fast."

628
00:36:27.446 --> 00:36:28.534
Why did you say that?

629
00:36:30.623 --> 00:36:32.451
- I wanted to be a skydive
instructor.

630
00:36:32.494 --> 00:36:33.452
- No shit.

631
00:36:33.495 --> 00:36:34.366
- Yeah.

632
00:36:34.409 --> 00:36:35.149
- How many times did you jump?

633
00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:36.629
- One.

634
00:36:36.672 --> 00:36:37.804
- And then I was like.

635
00:36:37.847 --> 00:36:39.806
Hey. maybe I'll like start a
band.

636
00:36:39.849 --> 00:36:41.938
but how do you find all
those different people

637
00:36:41.982 --> 00:36:44.245
to play those individual
instruments?

638
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.030
And then I was like.

639
00:36:47.074 --> 00:36:47.944
well. maybe I'll get into like

640
00:36:47.988 --> 00:36:49.772
the skateboard apparel industry.

641
00:36:49.816 --> 00:36:51.339
but for some reason my parol
counselor

642
00:36:51.383 --> 00:36:54.212
was really against me
getting into fashion.

643
00:36:57.084 --> 00:37:00.957
And I wanted to work on a
fishing boat in Jamaica.

644
00:37:01.001 --> 00:37:02.742
maybe like surfing tours or
something.

645
00:37:02.785 --> 00:37:07.355
But there's some legal
issues with the passport.

646
00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:10.837
The point is that nothing
ever quite clicked.

647
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.578
- Yes. I floated around a lot
too.

648
00:37:17.191 --> 00:37:21.326
I feel like I was built for
this.

649
00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.895
- I would also think I was
built for this

650
00:37:25.939 --> 00:37:28.333
if my thing was electricity

651
00:37:28.376 --> 00:37:31.205
and treasure hunting and not
gravity.

652
00:37:33.381 --> 00:37:35.253
- There's nothing to that?

653
00:37:35.296 --> 00:37:37.211
- I mean my entire life.

654
00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:40.083
I felt like there's like
this invisible force

655
00:37:40.127 --> 00:37:43.783
just holding me back from
accomplishing anything

656
00:37:43.826 --> 00:37:45.698
I dream about. anything I want
to do.

657
00:37:45.741 --> 00:37:47.003
- That's super depressing

658
00:37:47.047 --> 00:37:48.396
and you should talk to
a therapist about that.

659
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.399
- I am not like a
continuously depressed person.

660
00:37:52.922 --> 00:37:55.142
This cop just totally parked in
my space.

661
00:37:56.099 --> 00:37:59.102
I just feel like someone
chucked me out of an airplane

662
00:37:59.146 --> 00:38:00.495
when I was a baby.

663
00:38:00.539 --> 00:38:03.890
And I've been at terminal
velocity my entire life.

664
00:38:03.933 --> 00:38:08.416
I didn't ask that person to
chuck me out of that airplane.

665
00:38:17.556 --> 00:38:20.080
[cop cursing]

666
00:38:22.822 --> 00:38:24.214
- How does your parole work.

667
00:38:25.912 --> 00:38:28.654
[deep breathing]

668
00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:53.592
[knock on the door]

669
00:39:00.381 --> 00:39:01.600
You know it's insanely weird

670
00:39:01.643 --> 00:39:03.906
that you give apples
to kids for Halloween.

671
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:05.081
Actually you know it's weird.

672
00:39:05.125 --> 00:39:06.648
is that their parents don't
just check

673
00:39:06.692 --> 00:39:08.824
the sex offender registry before
they send them marching up

674
00:39:08.868 --> 00:39:09.738
to your door.

675
00:39:09.782 --> 00:39:10.652
You know. they're gonna check

676
00:39:10.696 --> 00:39:12.088
those apples for razors though.

677
00:39:12.132 --> 00:39:14.003
- The OD across the way was
originally

678
00:39:14.047 --> 00:39:15.309
put it is a murder

679
00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:16.484
and parents still bring
their children there.

680
00:39:16.528 --> 00:39:17.964
I don't think they're worried
about

681
00:39:18.007 --> 00:39:19.879
the who guy peed on a wall.

682
00:39:19.922 --> 00:39:22.577
[camera shuttering]

683
00:39:22.621 --> 00:39:25.319
[ominous music]

684
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.735
[door cringing]

685
00:39:50.736 --> 00:39:53.391
[ominous music]

686
00:40:04.924 --> 00:40:07.840
[items clattering]

687
00:40:17.545 --> 00:40:19.068
- [Robert] Well. basically when
people buy

688
00:40:19.112 --> 00:40:20.853
or build on a property.

689
00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:23.159
they hire me to come in

690
00:40:23.203 --> 00:40:25.466
and assess for any geologic
hazards.

691
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:30.558
landslides. seismic activity.
sink holes. volcanoes.

692
00:40:30.602 --> 00:40:33.169
- [John] Volcanoes? Are you
serious?

693
00:40:33.213 --> 00:40:34.910
- Yeah. Volcanoes.

694
00:40:34.954 --> 00:40:36.216
[ominous music]

695
00:40:36.259 --> 00:40:37.347
- [John] That's awesome.

696
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:38.566
Can you just tell me what you
found

697
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.655
in the soil samples beneath the
apartment?

698
00:40:40.699 --> 00:40:42.091
- Yeah. Well. I know you were
concerned

699
00:40:42.135 --> 00:40:43.615
that there were some anomalies.

700
00:40:43.658 --> 00:40:46.269
The chromium was a little high.

701
00:40:46.313 --> 00:40:47.445
There was some Lead in there.

702
00:40:47.488 --> 00:40:50.317
I have some from pre 1978 paint
job.

703
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.493
but everything was okay.

704
00:40:52.537 --> 00:40:55.148
No more arsenic or anything
like that.

705
00:40:55.191 --> 00:40:57.846
- [John] The other.
The other thing I know.

706
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:58.978
- What's that?

707
00:40:59.021 --> 00:41:00.545
- [John] The crystal thing.

708
00:41:00.588 --> 00:41:01.763
- The crystal?

709
00:41:03.504 --> 00:41:04.462
- Are you all right?

710
00:41:06.812 --> 00:41:10.163
[footsteps approaching]

711
00:41:12.557 --> 00:41:15.037
- Do you mind shooting this
real quick?

712
00:41:15.081 --> 00:41:15.908
- Why?

713
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.565
- Well. it's supposed to be 175

714
00:41:22.218 --> 00:41:25.831
and it's obviously much lower.

715
00:41:25.874 --> 00:41:27.267
And if gravity is fluctuating

716
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:28.877
that much it could be really
messing

717
00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:31.445
with the foundation of the
building

718
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:34.143
and that earthquake had
just been a warning shot.

719
00:41:36.581 --> 00:41:38.583
- I don't want to invalidate
what you're saying at all.

720
00:41:38.626 --> 00:41:40.280
It's just. you know what I
mean we live in Los Angeles.

721
00:41:40.323 --> 00:41:41.542
there's earthquakes all the time

722
00:41:41.586 --> 00:41:46.025
and people's weight
fluctuates. It's normal.

723
00:41:46.068 --> 00:41:47.417
I mean. it just think

724
00:41:47.461 --> 00:41:48.854
we've got to be kind of
scientific about this.

725
00:41:48.897 --> 00:41:52.727
we can't just assign meaning
to every little thing.

726
00:41:52.771 --> 00:41:54.120
- I get all that.

727
00:41:54.163 --> 00:41:57.427
but if in a month we got
from some floating things

728
00:41:57.471 --> 00:42:00.779
and some lights to
earthquakes by New Year's

729
00:42:00.822 --> 00:42:02.607
we would be under rubble.

730
00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.783
And we did agree when we
started this.

731
00:42:04.826 --> 00:42:07.176
that if we felt like we
were in danger. we'd stop.

732
00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.961
And I'm not saying we should
stop.

733
00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:12.442
I think we should at
least acknowledge this.

734
00:42:18.448 --> 00:42:21.974
- I've been giving some thought
to that title you suggested.

735
00:42:22.017 --> 00:42:26.239
And honestly I think I just
judged it a little too early

736
00:42:26.282 --> 00:42:27.762
and I think it's thematically
resonant

737
00:42:27.806 --> 00:42:29.895
with what we're trying to do
here.

738
00:42:29.938 --> 00:42:32.245
And I think we should use it.

739
00:42:37.642 --> 00:42:39.774
- "The door that wouldn't shut."

740
00:42:41.646 --> 00:42:44.605
[ghostly whistling]

741
00:42:48.217 --> 00:42:51.569
[Electric static noise]

742
00:42:54.267 --> 00:42:56.922
[ominous music]

743
00:42:58.837 --> 00:43:02.014
- Hey. can you mute that really
quick?

744
00:43:05.495 --> 00:43:08.150
[ominous music]

745
00:43:20.946 --> 00:43:23.601
[door cringing]

746
00:43:24.993 --> 00:43:27.648
[ominous music]

747
00:43:46.493 --> 00:43:48.016
- I listen to this podcast.

748
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.279
actually can you record that
really quick on your camera?

749
00:43:53.456 --> 00:43:54.762
- So. we're rolling.

750
00:43:56.198 --> 00:43:58.984
- I have this podcast
that I listened to by.

751
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.074
I don't even know.

752
00:44:03.205 --> 00:44:07.645
He has this kind of wild
unifying theory

753
00:44:07.688 --> 00:44:12.650
of the universe that the
aliens actually planted

754
00:44:13.259 --> 00:44:14.869
the building blocks of life on
earth

755
00:44:14.913 --> 00:44:17.829
as some kind of a science
experiment.

756
00:44:17.872 --> 00:44:19.700
And they don't want to
contaminate their experiment.

757
00:44:19.744 --> 00:44:21.659
which is why we don't hear from
them.

758
00:44:21.702 --> 00:44:23.878
but we will make contact

759
00:44:23.922 --> 00:44:25.314
or they will make contact at
some point

760
00:44:25.358 --> 00:44:29.014
once we are socially and
politically evolved enough.

761
00:44:29.057 --> 00:44:31.277
So maybe that's now maybe
that's us.

762
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.715
and maybe the heat and all
these critters

763
00:44:34.759 --> 00:44:36.325
and all of that is just
the flora and fauna

764
00:44:36.369 --> 00:44:38.458
and weather on another planet.

765
00:44:45.247 --> 00:44:47.162
- And that's actually
a really interesting.

766
00:44:47.206 --> 00:44:50.557
do you mind if I jump in
there and just kind of. okay.

767
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.385
I'm just gonna have to get that
frame up.

768
00:44:55.083 --> 00:44:56.868
So here's the thing.

769
00:44:56.911 --> 00:44:59.131
I saw online the other day

770
00:44:59.174 --> 00:45:01.786
that basically scientists think

771
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:05.528
that there are some planets
sort of like earth. right?

772
00:45:05.572 --> 00:45:07.313
But the nearest one.

773
00:45:07.356 --> 00:45:08.967
like the nearest one
that would have water.

774
00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.446
the nearest one to have
like little critter

775
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:11.621
like the one we've been hearing.

776
00:45:11.665 --> 00:45:15.843
it would be like 6.000 years
away using

777
00:45:15.887 --> 00:45:18.454
the best technology we
could possibly come up with.

778
00:45:19.804 --> 00:45:21.153
That being what it is.

779
00:45:22.632 --> 00:45:24.373
how do we explain it being in
my attic?

780
00:45:24.417 --> 00:45:27.725
Also. where did you hear this
podcast?

781
00:45:30.075 --> 00:45:31.903
- Just on a message board
somewhere.

782
00:45:33.905 --> 00:45:36.168
- Are there message pods for
more things

783
00:45:36.211 --> 00:45:38.953
than like anime and finding
contract killers and stuff?

784
00:45:38.997 --> 00:45:40.520
- Just because something sounds

785
00:45:40.563 --> 00:45:42.217
a little bit crazy doesn't
mean it's not partially true.

786
00:45:42.261 --> 00:45:45.133
I mean. that's how you find
truth.

787
00:45:45.177 --> 00:45:48.223
MK ultra. that was actually
mind control.

788
00:45:48.267 --> 00:45:50.399
COINTELPRO that was real.

789
00:45:50.443 --> 00:45:53.663
soft disclosure of UFO's
just happened to Congress.

790
00:45:55.578 --> 00:45:58.059
- Here we are at the launch
status center.

791
00:45:58.103 --> 00:46:01.628
Let's go inside and see if we
can find anybody to talk to.

792
00:46:02.803 --> 00:46:07.025
NASA has known about a time
travel method

793
00:46:07.068 --> 00:46:08.374
of Albert Einstein.

794
00:46:08.417 --> 00:46:10.637
He said. if you travel
at the speed of light.

795
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.073
you can time travel.

796
00:46:15.076 --> 00:46:16.512
- Time travel.

797
00:46:16.556 --> 00:46:18.079
- Start over.

798
00:46:18.123 --> 00:46:20.778
[ominous music]

799
00:47:11.959 --> 00:47:13.569
- There is no light source.

800
00:47:17.182 --> 00:47:19.837
[ominous music]

801
00:47:21.142 --> 00:47:21.969
- Crystal?

802
00:47:23.231 --> 00:47:25.407
You mean the quartz deposits?

803
00:47:25.451 --> 00:47:26.539
- [John] Yeah. and how

804
00:47:26.582 --> 00:47:27.801
it can create electricity and
focus.

805
00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:31.196
- It definitely doesn't
create electricity.

806
00:47:31.239 --> 00:47:33.546
Quartz is the most abundant
mineral in the world.

807
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:36.854
If you have them underneath
your house you're fine.

808
00:47:37.942 --> 00:47:40.553
[soft humming]

809
00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:44.513
[ominous music]

810
00:48:09.625 --> 00:48:11.714
- [John] In your own words.

811
00:48:11.758 --> 00:48:13.760
Just say what happened here?

812
00:48:15.936 --> 00:48:18.852
- I think that if one was to
express

813
00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:22.769
what you thought happened to
you.

814
00:48:22.812 --> 00:48:24.640
it might be seen as trying

815
00:48:24.684 --> 00:48:26.555
to garner some fame and
attention.

816
00:48:26.599 --> 00:48:29.819
- [John] Wind a minute. you
know. these things found us.

817
00:48:29.863 --> 00:48:31.517
we're not doing it for fame or
recognition

818
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.127
or anything like that.

819
00:48:35.608 --> 00:48:38.176
We just saw something profound

820
00:48:39.742 --> 00:48:42.571
and we wanted to share it with
the world.

821
00:48:42.615 --> 00:48:46.488
I don't know what the
problem with that would be.

822
00:48:47.707 --> 00:48:49.535
- I don't want to be rude.

823
00:48:49.578 --> 00:48:51.189
- [John] It's okay. It's okay.

824
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.715
- Why didn't you play
yourselves in the recreations?

825
00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:01.503
[door banging]

826
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:09.511
- Is that exactly where
the snake skin was?

827
00:49:09.555 --> 00:49:13.167
- Yeah. It was a little
bit more in a closet.

828
00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:14.603
but I just pulled it a
little out for the shot.

829
00:49:14.647 --> 00:49:16.954
just so it would show up
more on camera on this side.

830
00:49:16.997 --> 00:49:18.651
- Okay. Cool.

831
00:49:18.694 --> 00:49:21.001
Well. I mean your sleep looked
great.

832
00:49:21.045 --> 00:49:22.698
You wanna cut?

833
00:49:22.742 --> 00:49:24.439
- Yeah. Okay. Awesome.

834
00:49:24.483 --> 00:49:28.400
- All right. It's so weird
doing all this stuff over again.

835
00:49:28.443 --> 00:49:31.055
It's like you're taking too
many edibles

836
00:49:31.098 --> 00:49:32.317
and watch Unsolved Mysteries

837
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.493
and you think you on
the recreation sketch.

838
00:49:36.321 --> 00:49:37.148
- [John] Nope.

839
00:49:39.063 --> 00:49:40.194
- Pod of Orcas.

840
00:49:40.238 --> 00:49:41.326
apex predator of the sea

841
00:49:41.369 --> 00:49:43.763
and obviously an Orca has never
attacked

842
00:49:43.806 --> 00:49:45.286
a human in the wild.

843
00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:48.028
but still just out of fucking
respect.

844
00:49:48.072 --> 00:49:49.682
I hold out on the spear

845
00:49:50.683 --> 00:49:52.119
and one of them swims over.

846
00:49:52.163 --> 00:49:53.120
I call him Shamoo.

847
00:49:53.164 --> 00:49:55.905
He swam over and just gently ate

848
00:49:57.211 --> 00:49:58.865
the stingray right off my spear

849
00:49:58.908 --> 00:50:00.388
and then swims away with the
pod singing

850
00:50:00.432 --> 00:50:02.651
these beautiful whale
songs like just for me.

851
00:50:02.695 --> 00:50:04.610
- Hey I keep on having this
idea.

852
00:50:04.653 --> 00:50:06.046
Actually do you mind
rolling this really quick?

853
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:07.178
I'm sorry. I just.

854
00:50:07.221 --> 00:50:09.702
- Yeah. Yeah. Let's do this.

855
00:50:09.745 --> 00:50:13.401
- So I think you're right about

856
00:50:13.445 --> 00:50:15.447
the distance thing with the
aliens.

857
00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:17.971
I think it's impossible
to had any contact.

858
00:50:18.015 --> 00:50:19.103
it's too far away.

859
00:50:19.146 --> 00:50:21.148
but if the universe is actually

860
00:50:21.192 --> 00:50:24.238
in 10 dimensions like this
Ted talk I listened to.

861
00:50:24.282 --> 00:50:26.762
maybe these gateways to other
dimensions

862
00:50:26.806 --> 00:50:28.112
are actually just all around us.

863
00:50:28.155 --> 00:50:30.244
And the gateways are right top
of us.

864
00:50:30.288 --> 00:50:31.506
We just can't see them.

865
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.813
So maybe your closet down there.

866
00:50:33.856 --> 00:50:37.295
that's just another gateway
to another dimension

867
00:50:37.338 --> 00:50:39.862
that has different temperatures

868
00:50:39.906 --> 00:50:42.952
and different flora and
fauna and our creators.

869
00:50:45.346 --> 00:50:47.261
trying to get us to do
something.

870
00:50:52.005 --> 00:50:53.006
You like it?

871
00:50:56.401 --> 00:50:59.578
- See. that and this.

872
00:50:59.621 --> 00:51:01.841
just a couple of things
I'm gonna miss about LA.

873
00:51:01.884 --> 00:51:03.190
- I think you're crazy if you
are leaving.

874
00:51:03.234 --> 00:51:05.366
- I mean. this is gonna change
everything.

875
00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:12.330
- The other night I was
leaving my shift at work.

876
00:51:12.373 --> 00:51:13.940
I heard a little buzz

877
00:51:13.983 --> 00:51:18.118
and I'm walking home. walking
up Sunset.

878
00:51:18.162 --> 00:51:19.293
There is always people
who are getting ready

879
00:51:19.337 --> 00:51:21.078
for some big. dirty crazy night
out.

880
00:51:21.121 --> 00:51:22.731
And you kind of feel the energy
of it.

881
00:51:22.775 --> 00:51:25.560
And the Santa Ana winds are
blowing

882
00:51:25.604 --> 00:51:30.087
and I look over and it's
another coyote.

883
00:51:31.218 --> 00:51:34.308
He's looking right through
me like I'm a ghost.

884
00:51:34.352 --> 00:51:35.701
And then he just trots off.

885
00:51:35.744 --> 00:51:38.834
down Sunset Boulevard.
that big old coyote smile.

886
00:51:38.878 --> 00:51:42.403
And no one talks about like
those moments in Los Angeles.

887
00:51:42.447 --> 00:51:43.491
People talk about the traffic.

888
00:51:43.535 --> 00:51:44.666
People talk about everything
else.

889
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:46.320
everything they can complain
about.

890
00:51:46.364 --> 00:51:49.497
but they never talk about
like those magical LA moments.

891
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.111
- Yeah. You got to dig
deep in the city for it but

892
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:57.723
Magic is there.

893
00:51:57.766 --> 00:51:59.333
- Today I had this fantasy.

894
00:51:59.377 --> 00:52:01.118
I am living in some small town.

895
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:03.859
like a small town. like
in Stephen King stories.

896
00:52:03.903 --> 00:52:05.078
where you can afford rent

897
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:06.819
and like some big ass Victorian
house

898
00:52:06.862 --> 00:52:11.824
and get a dog and go to summer
festivals

899
00:52:11.867 --> 00:52:13.304
and eat fresh produce.

900
00:52:13.347 --> 00:52:18.135
And this documentary would
be like my retirement fund

901
00:52:18.178 --> 00:52:19.571
for that life.

902
00:52:19.614 --> 00:52:21.573
- You know. they chose
this location for Hollywood

903
00:52:21.616 --> 00:52:23.140
because of the beautiful light?

904
00:52:24.663 --> 00:52:29.363
I am no Hemingway but I feel
like we found light literally

905
00:52:29.407 --> 00:52:32.105
and metaphorically just
right down in your apartment.

906
00:52:33.019 --> 00:52:34.629
Maybe you should take that as a
sign.

907
00:52:34.673 --> 00:52:36.414
Stick around a little while
longer.

908
00:52:36.457 --> 00:52:37.719
finish this documentary.

909
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:42.550
You'll see another magic coyote.

910
00:52:44.813 --> 00:52:46.598
Maybe I can set you up with
someone.

911
00:52:49.383 --> 00:52:50.863
- Here we go.

912
00:52:50.906 --> 00:52:52.125
- What?

913
00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:54.649
- Like I've never been
attracted to anyone.

914
00:52:56.521 --> 00:52:58.697
And that is a very hard thing

915
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:02.266
to explain to people that
you'd be interested in dating.

916
00:53:03.919 --> 00:53:07.401
[airplane engine roaring]

917
00:53:10.404 --> 00:53:12.841
- It's getting a little
unsettling.

918
00:53:13.973 --> 00:53:16.193
- You don't think that has
anything

919
00:53:16.236 --> 00:53:18.717
to do with what we're doing
downstairs.

920
00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.545
like it's Bermuda triangle shit.

921
00:53:20.588 --> 00:53:24.897
- No. I get the no attraction
thing.

922
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:27.682
but you know. Lonnie
for all of his faults.

923
00:53:27.726 --> 00:53:29.945
for all the reasons it didn't
really work out between us.

924
00:53:29.989 --> 00:53:34.036
to me at least he was accepting.

925
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.256
he wanted to bring kids
into this apocalypse.

926
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.953
which is bonkers.

927
00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:40.434
- How do you mean?

928
00:53:43.524 --> 00:53:45.526
- I was out with this guy
one time on one of the apps

929
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:48.921
and we're talking about all the
ways

930
00:53:48.964 --> 00:53:50.488
that the world could end.

931
00:53:51.315 --> 00:53:54.361
I mean. we're all gonna die.
right?

932
00:53:55.536 --> 00:53:57.146
We're so fixated on not dying.

933
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:58.060
but it's all gonna happen to us.

934
00:53:58.104 --> 00:53:59.148
So what's the big deal?

935
00:53:59.192 --> 00:54:00.759
I mean what's even the big deal

936
00:54:03.327 --> 00:54:08.332
with like genocides and then
the conversation naturally led

937
00:54:09.681 --> 00:54:12.161
to my church and people get all
binary

938
00:54:12.205 --> 00:54:14.381
when they hear the word
evangelicals.

939
00:54:14.425 --> 00:54:16.992
I mean. people use this phrase
to give themselves peace.

940
00:54:17.036 --> 00:54:18.690
"This too shall pass." right?

941
00:54:18.733 --> 00:54:20.039
But you can just say.

942
00:54:20.082 --> 00:54:22.215
"This to shall end."

943
00:54:22.259 --> 00:54:25.566
It's the same sentiment. the
world's ending for sure. Right?

944
00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:28.569
So why even worry?

945
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:33.182
You know. it's kinda like you
not wanting

946
00:54:34.053 --> 00:54:35.228
to do it with anyone.

947
00:54:36.969 --> 00:54:38.753
You don't understand it unless
it's you.

948
00:54:42.453 --> 00:54:45.151
- Alright. Actually I got to
get to bed.

949
00:54:46.108 --> 00:54:47.327
- Actually the bar is open soon

950
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:48.241
if you want we can just
grab a quick drink.

951
00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:50.722
- No. I've got to work tonight.

952
00:54:52.985 --> 00:54:55.640
[ominous music]

953
00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.994
- [Narrator] That makes them
quite literally the angels

954
00:55:02.037 --> 00:55:03.952
and not just Abrahamic
religions.

955
00:55:03.996 --> 00:55:06.868
but very likely the
Samaritans and Babylonians.

956
00:55:06.912 --> 00:55:09.306
Well folks tonight. this
lone voice in the desert.

957
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:12.178
will talk to author. Jesse
Summoner. about his latest book.

958
00:55:12.221 --> 00:55:13.484
"Inter-dimensional Angels.

959
00:55:13.527 --> 00:55:15.529
Spirituality in an
Ultra-Terrestrial

960
00:55:15.573 --> 00:55:16.835
World Multi-Verse."

961
00:55:16.878 --> 00:55:18.315
As well as his lecture series

962
00:55:18.358 --> 00:55:19.794
on the works of John Keel

963
00:55:19.838 --> 00:55:22.580
and research in the so-called
Arcadian time anomalies.

964
00:55:22.623 --> 00:55:23.842
in the world. San Diego.

965
00:55:28.847 --> 00:55:31.502
- Why are you dressed like that?

966
00:55:34.287 --> 00:55:36.376
- I don't want to get
bit by a black widow.

967
00:55:37.334 --> 00:55:39.292
If this thing. going against
the walls.

968
00:55:40.598 --> 00:55:41.990
Bit someone.

969
00:55:42.034 --> 00:55:46.299
We didn't call animal
control. I feel really bad.

970
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:47.605
- I thought I'd measure

971
00:55:47.648 --> 00:55:50.216
because building codes
have standardized ratios

972
00:55:50.259 --> 00:55:51.957
for a long time.

973
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.438
So you can buy third-party
stuff from Home Depot.

974
00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.789
Your closet threshold
has a different ratio

975
00:55:57.832 --> 00:56:00.444
than the rest of the building.

976
00:56:00.487 --> 00:56:03.185
[ominous music]

977
00:56:14.893 --> 00:56:17.809
[glass shattering]

978
00:56:18.766 --> 00:56:21.421
[ominous music]

979
00:56:36.871 --> 00:56:37.872
- Holy shit.

980
00:56:39.221 --> 00:56:41.876
[ominous music]

981
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:09.948
[electric static from the
device]

982
00:57:22.482 --> 00:57:26.443
[machine whirring indistinctly]

983
00:57:36.365 --> 00:57:39.717
- There's this thing
called Jerusalem syndrome.

984
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.022
It's when people go to

985
00:57:41.066 --> 00:57:43.068
that city for the first
time in the modern day.

986
00:57:43.111 --> 00:57:47.551
they get the sense that their
whole life led to that moment.

987
00:57:50.902 --> 00:57:52.686
I think maybe that's what I'm
doing.

988
00:57:53.731 --> 00:57:56.298
- That's what they speak in
Jerusalem?

989
00:57:56.342 --> 00:57:57.386
- No. that was Greek.

990
00:57:58.779 --> 00:58:00.651
- I had this really cool math
teacher.

991
00:58:00.694 --> 00:58:02.653
the one that got me into math.

992
00:58:02.696 --> 00:58:03.610
And she was this hippie

993
00:58:03.654 --> 00:58:05.743
that would do these long units

994
00:58:06.744 --> 00:58:08.049
on interesting mathematicians.

995
00:58:08.093 --> 00:58:10.443
And she did this whole week on
Pythagoras.

996
00:58:11.618 --> 00:58:12.967
You know. the triangle guy?

997
00:58:14.578 --> 00:58:15.796
A squared + B squared?

998
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:19.278
High school. middle school?

999
00:58:21.149 --> 00:58:24.892
Anyway. he actually had this
society.

1000
00:58:24.936 --> 00:58:26.198
some people called it a cult.

1001
00:58:26.241 --> 00:58:28.505
but it was called the
Pythagorean brotherhood.

1002
00:58:28.548 --> 00:58:31.551
And they did everything from
a numerology to reincarnation.

1003
00:58:31.595 --> 00:58:34.685
to. you know. ritual summoning
magic.

1004
00:58:34.728 --> 00:58:35.903
They worshiped numbers.

1005
00:58:37.078 --> 00:58:39.994
What I'm getting at is I fully
recognize

1006
00:58:40.038 --> 00:58:42.040
that I might be all Jerusalem
syndrome

1007
00:58:42.083 --> 00:58:47.088
in LA right now. but I think
maybe that's what this is.

1008
00:58:49.482 --> 00:58:51.223
I think it's the Pythagoras.

1009
00:58:51.266 --> 00:58:54.531
- Well. why can't be a
group like the Freemasons

1010
00:58:54.574 --> 00:58:58.273
or the Moose Lodge or...

1011
00:58:58.317 --> 00:58:59.144
- What's that?

1012
00:59:00.624 --> 00:59:02.756
- The one that's on discovery
channel all the time.

1013
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.758
It's the Rose Croutons.

1014
00:59:04.802 --> 00:59:07.587
- The Rose Croutons?

1015
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:08.545
The Rosicrucian's.

1016
00:59:10.459 --> 00:59:11.722
Yeah. I mean.

1017
00:59:11.765 --> 00:59:13.550
I guess it could be any
fraternal organization.

1018
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:16.727
but when you want to
figure this out. right?

1019
00:59:20.078 --> 00:59:23.255
- So you're saying the
shitty apartment next door

1020
00:59:23.298 --> 00:59:25.083
is a magic Greek temple.

1021
00:59:27.041 --> 00:59:29.696
[ominous music]

1022
00:59:36.094 --> 00:59:39.271
- This is just dream logic.

1023
00:59:45.494 --> 00:59:47.496
- This isn't a year.

1024
00:59:49.237 --> 00:59:51.588
It is the number of days I
spent in a mental institution

1025
00:59:51.631 --> 00:59:52.676
when I was a teenager.

1026
00:59:53.981 --> 00:59:57.985
- It's like all of your
teenage years. what for?

1027
00:59:59.857 --> 01:00:03.556
- You're part of an
evangelical Armageddon church.

1028
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.385
And you're judging me for
managing my mental health

1029
01:00:06.428 --> 01:00:07.299
at a young age?

1030
01:00:07.342 --> 01:00:09.910
- I'm not. I'm sincerely not.

1031
01:00:09.954 --> 01:00:11.303
And is that what you've been
acting so weird about today?

1032
01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:12.521
My church group?

1033
01:00:12.565 --> 01:00:13.827
- I am acting weird

1034
01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:17.570
because you compared my sexual
identity

1035
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:21.748
to your apocalypse church.

1036
01:00:22.923 --> 01:00:25.622
[ominous music]

1037
01:00:36.284 --> 01:00:40.637
- We celebrate Christmas without
believing in Santa. right?

1038
01:00:45.946 --> 01:00:47.121
It's like that.

1039
01:00:47.165 --> 01:00:48.383
It's exactly like that.

1040
01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:51.822
We celebrate and talk about the
end

1041
01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:54.999
because it gives us a sense
of community. progress...

1042
01:00:55.042 --> 01:00:57.479
[diminishing voice]

1043
01:00:57.523 --> 01:00:58.306
- My first thought was.

1044
01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:59.612
"This is my cue to leave."

1045
01:01:02.006 --> 01:01:03.268
Then I'm walking to Griffith
park

1046
01:01:03.311 --> 01:01:04.312
and I'm taking umm...

1047
01:01:07.054 --> 01:01:08.708
And I come across this park
bench

1048
01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:10.318
that has this plaque on it.

1049
01:01:10.362 --> 01:01:12.451
And on the plaque is William
Thomson

1050
01:01:12.494 --> 01:01:16.847
from the tape who turns
out was the city planner.

1051
01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.370
- Good work.

1052
01:01:18.413 --> 01:01:19.980
- And I felt like I made a
discovery.

1053
01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:22.287
I made a break through.

1054
01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:25.333
[phone ringing]

1055
01:01:25.377 --> 01:01:27.945

[gentle pianissimo music]

1065
01:04:00.967 --> 01:04:03.056
You left the windows closed
again.

1066
01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.407
The closet is trying to
cook us in our sleep.

1067
01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:07.931
- Sorry about that.

1068
01:04:07.974 --> 01:04:10.542
I looked up who owned that
website

1069
01:04:10.585 --> 01:04:13.632
and I just found this
social media profile left up

1070
01:04:13.675 --> 01:04:15.416
as a Memorial to some dead guy.

1071
01:04:16.461 --> 01:04:19.029
- We just sorta run something
past you.

1072
01:04:19.072 --> 01:04:23.729
What if that is stop?

1073
01:04:23.772 --> 01:04:25.296
You know. and what if the other
night

1074
01:04:25.339 --> 01:04:28.386
when that block of quartz
was almost dropped to my head

1075
01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:31.128
what if that was a message
that was like. "Hey. stop."

1076
01:04:32.694 --> 01:04:35.784
- We're not quite in dangerous
uncharted territory yet.

1077
01:04:35.828 --> 01:04:37.351
I mean. Jesus man. we're in
Laurel Canyon.

1078
01:04:37.395 --> 01:04:38.613
Harry Houdini used to live here.

1079
01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:40.659
Jim Morrison used to
live here. I don't know.

1080
01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:42.052
Maybe we were just the most
recent people

1081
01:04:42.095 --> 01:04:44.576
that tap into its special
frequency or something.

1082
01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:46.056
- You realized that everyone

1083
01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:47.927
you just said had a horrible
death.

1084
01:04:52.149 --> 01:04:55.326
[gentle guitar music]

1085
01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:01.810
- Did you hear that?

1086
01:05:01.854 --> 01:05:02.681
- Yeah.

1087
01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:07.468
[gentle guitar music]

1088
01:05:12.082 --> 01:05:13.344
Hey can you play with it?

1089

[guitar music]

1090
01:05:20.090 --> 01:05:24.224
Yeah. Okay. Keep playing.
I'll be right back.

[brisk guitar music]

1092
01:05:55.864 --> 01:05:58.563
Pythagoras had this thing
called the Honey of the Spheres.

1093
01:05:58.606 --> 01:06:00.217
Where he believed that the
movement

1094
01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.306
of the stars corresponded to
musical notes

1095
01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:05.135
and the musical notes
will make a symphony.

1096
01:06:05.178 --> 01:06:09.052
So play again. but just
really slow because I suck.

1097
01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:10.967
I've only play this thing a few
times.

1098
01:06:12.707 --> 01:06:13.534
- Alright.

1099
01:06:19.932 --> 01:06:22.935
[soft guitar music]

1100
01:06:28.201 --> 01:06:29.898
- All right see. Higher.

1101
01:06:32.336 --> 01:06:34.033
- Actually. I think we might be
good.

1102
01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:37.036
I think we kinda got the.
you know. how it works

1103
01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.212
and how this does the whole
thing.

1104
01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:41.693
- I don't think anyone's
gonna buy half a documentary.

1105
01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:45.479
- The thing is pretty heavy.

1106
01:06:46.698 --> 01:06:47.829
- Hey. I really get it.

1107
01:06:49.614 --> 01:06:50.745
we are on to something.

1108
01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:53.748
Just do it for me please.

1109
01:07:02.235 --> 01:07:03.845
Thank you. Alright.

1110
01:07:11.636 --> 01:07:14.726
[rapid guitar music]

1111
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:21.907
[high pitched electric static]

1112
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.654
- Oh. what the fuck.

1113
01:07:31.873 --> 01:07:34.528
[alarm blaring]

1114
01:07:37.314 --> 01:07:39.272
- I mean Beethoven was deaf.

1115
01:07:39.316 --> 01:07:40.665
Are your ears still ringing?

1116
01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:43.581
- My ears are so fucked
they cannot get any worse.

1117
01:07:43.624 --> 01:07:44.538
- Are you in a band or
something.

1118
01:07:44.582 --> 01:07:46.062
- I wish I was in a band.

1119
01:07:46.105 --> 01:07:48.977
I worked the summer at
symphony hall in San Antonio

1120
01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:50.327
and something about the
acoustics there.

1121
01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:52.633
Night after night just
battered my ear drums.

1122
01:07:52.677 --> 01:07:54.287
- Oh man. I would've quit.

1123
01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:56.202
- [Levi] Couldn't quit. It was
my job. I had to pay my rent.

1124
01:07:56.246 --> 01:07:57.421
- Oh yeah. sorry.

1125
01:07:57.464 --> 01:08:01.207
- It was part of another
probation program.

1126
01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:02.121
- Another one?

1127
01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.042
- I'm not offended.

1128
01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.087
I get. this is really
entertaining for you.

1129
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:15.439
but this one involves my sister

1130
01:08:15.482 --> 01:08:17.005
and out of respect for her.

1131
01:08:17.049 --> 01:08:20.879
I'd rather just not talk about
it. especially on camera.

1132
01:08:20.922 --> 01:08:22.663
- [John] Oh yeah. yeah. Sorry
about that.

1133
01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:25.057
Yeah. Camera is off.

1134
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:27.364
So think about every little
thing

1135
01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:29.714
that's taking you to this
moment so far.

1136
01:08:29.757 --> 01:08:31.803
can't change anything by like a
second.

1137
01:08:31.846 --> 01:08:33.283
And we never even meet these
things.

1138
01:08:33.326 --> 01:08:35.459
- No closet. no symbol. No 1908.

1139
01:08:37.461 --> 01:08:40.812
[traffic light beeping]

1140
01:08:43.858 --> 01:08:44.772
That was amazing.

1141
01:08:44.816 --> 01:08:48.167
- Yeah. I mean. what's crazier?

1142
01:08:48.211 --> 01:08:50.213
Believing every single
coincidence you ever see

1143
01:08:50.256 --> 01:08:51.605
or just ignoring them all.

1144
01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:54.956
- In last week. Yeah.
Timing changes everything.

1145
01:08:59.918 --> 01:09:01.876
- I thought this through. stay
with me.

1146
01:09:03.617 --> 01:09:05.489
you and me. our whole lives.

1147
01:09:05.532 --> 01:09:09.623
We've seen all of these movies
and TV shows and video games

1148
01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:13.192
that are basically about
simulations. right.

1149
01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:14.628
And right now.

1150
01:09:14.672 --> 01:09:18.632
me and you are making a film
referencing simulations.

1151
01:09:18.676 --> 01:09:20.330
Isn't this all totally stuff

1152
01:09:20.373 --> 01:09:23.463
that you would program
into your own simulation?

1153
01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:26.423
- So there were these
neuroscientists on it

1154
01:09:26.466 --> 01:09:28.381
that were saying that
unconscious minds

1155
01:09:28.425 --> 01:09:30.035
have their own agendas.

1156
01:09:30.078 --> 01:09:34.996
Maybe the entities are
controlling our unconscious
minds

1157
01:09:35.345 --> 01:09:36.172
in order to get us to do
something

1158
01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:38.217
like that signaling contact.

1159
01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:40.350
but the receivers are our
limbic systems.

1160
01:09:40.393 --> 01:09:44.005
- And then someday someone's
gonna watch this finished film.

1161
01:09:44.049 --> 01:09:46.269
I'll be watching from their
simulations

1162
01:09:46.312 --> 01:09:49.402
and all of their simulations
will collide

1163
01:09:49.446 --> 01:09:51.187
with this simulation right here.

1164
01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:53.798
- I'd say. I just can't figure
out

1165
01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:55.713
what that has to do with the
Pythagorean.

1166
01:09:55.756 --> 01:09:58.063
but I think it's really cool.

1167
01:09:59.804 --> 01:10:02.502
- All right. What you're saying
makes perfect sense. but...

1168
01:10:02.546 --> 01:10:03.373
- What is?

1169
01:10:04.722 --> 01:10:07.203
- Cats. there are these
parasites

1170
01:10:07.246 --> 01:10:08.247
that you can get from cats

1171
01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:10.206
that actually mind control
humans.

1172
01:10:10.249 --> 01:10:12.599
That's totally real. You can
look it up.

1173
01:10:12.643 --> 01:10:14.079
There's cats all around our
buildings

1174
01:10:14.122 --> 01:10:16.473
so we can totally have these
parasites.

1175
01:10:16.516 --> 01:10:19.389
They might be using these
parasites to control us.

1176
01:10:19.432 --> 01:10:22.479
Schizophrenia increased around
the turn of the century.

1177
01:10:22.522 --> 01:10:25.046
which is right around the
cat ownership became common.

1178
01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:26.309
- I've actually got to get to
work.

1179
01:10:26.352 --> 01:10:27.875
We should wrap this up.

1180
01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:28.789
- I mean. we haven't even
checked

1181
01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:29.877
like a third of the grave site.

1182
01:10:29.921 --> 01:10:31.096
- Well. I can't call in sick
again

1183
01:10:31.139 --> 01:10:32.445
chasing down apparently my
shitty theory.

1184
01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:36.406
[ominous music]

1185
01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:40.627
- Yeah. I don't know how you
knew

1186
01:10:45.371 --> 01:10:46.764
that that was my phone number.

1187
01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:49.070
That's a pretty well
coincidence.

1188
01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:50.246
- [John] It's nearly impossible.

1189
01:10:50.289 --> 01:10:51.812
- I mean. statistically it's
impossible

1190
01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:53.292
that coincidences don't happen.

1191
01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:54.598
- [John] You were compelled to
bring

1192
01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:56.861
in Dr. Rita Miller. right?

1193
01:10:56.904 --> 01:10:59.472
A chemistry PhD from UCLA.

1194
01:10:59.516 --> 01:11:00.734
And what was the point
at which you thought.

1195
01:11:00.778 --> 01:11:03.041
"All right. time to
bring in the big guns?"

1196
01:11:03.955 --> 01:11:08.176
- I suspected that there may
be some impaired thinking.

1197
01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:11.789
which is a side effect
of chromium and lead.

1198
01:11:11.832 --> 01:11:13.747
So I referred what I found

1199
01:11:13.791 --> 01:11:16.446
to a chemist that I knew in
undergrad.

1200
01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:20.145
Rita. also her PhD is in music
history.

1201
01:11:20.188 --> 01:11:21.494
It's not in chemistry.

1202
01:11:21.538 --> 01:11:23.714
- I think I would be most
natural.

1203
01:11:25.019 --> 01:11:26.760
It was like. I was doing
something else.

1204
01:11:26.804 --> 01:11:28.066
and then you just walked
up and you're like.

1205
01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:29.676
"Hey. you guys do this
like documentary thing."

1206
01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.461
And then you just do it that
way.

1207
01:11:31.504 --> 01:11:34.507
And then we get to the chemist
to drop off soil sample.

1208
01:11:34.551 --> 01:11:36.422
She wants to sign an NDA.

1209
01:11:36.466 --> 01:11:40.383
but it does turn out that her
wife went

1210
01:11:40.426 --> 01:11:42.036
to high school with John's
sister.

1211
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.951
- [John] Hang on. it's
messing up the audio.

1212
01:11:43.995 --> 01:11:47.564
- We get to the chemist to
drop off the soil sample

1213
01:11:47.607 --> 01:11:49.827
and she will not sign an NDA.

1214
01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:51.872
- Hang on you just look like
your picking up lenses...

1215
01:11:51.916 --> 01:11:53.265
- She will not sign an NDA.

1216
01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:54.527
- No. you look like
you're putting up lenses

1217
01:11:54.571 --> 01:11:55.746
and put them down. stop.

1218
01:11:57.878 --> 01:11:59.663
- And she will not sign an NDA.

1219
01:11:59.706 --> 01:12:04.581
but it turns out that high
school had the same name

1220
01:12:04.624 --> 01:12:07.627
as the street that John
found the first symbol.

1221
01:12:08.759 --> 01:12:11.239
And the phenomenon just
dried up. Just stopped.

1222
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.419
- [John] Can we just do
that last little bit.

1223
01:12:16.462 --> 01:12:18.072
but just kind of like dark and
mysterious

1224
01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:20.292
so that you can imagine the
music

1225
01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.381
and bite the apple with
finality theme

1226
01:12:22.425 --> 01:12:23.600
so we can cut out on it.

1227
01:12:24.992 --> 01:12:26.385
- Finality. Yeah. Got it.

1228
01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:29.388
And then the phenomenon
just dried up. Just stopped.

1229
01:12:29.432 --> 01:12:31.303
- [John] Wait. can we do
it without the glasses?

1230
01:12:33.436 --> 01:12:36.221
[static humming]

1231
01:12:43.097 --> 01:12:44.969
- Hey. you look cool.

1232
01:12:45.012 --> 01:12:47.754
You are a real smoker. Good at
it.

1233
01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:54.544
[camera shuttering]

1234
01:12:55.545 --> 01:12:59.375
[radio speaking indistinctly]

1235
01:13:01.855 --> 01:13:05.555
I'm a little lighter. which
I have mixed feelings about.

1236
01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:10.255
but maybe a little phenomenon
kicking in.

1237
01:13:10.298 --> 01:13:13.476
[radio speaking indistinctly]

1238
01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:14.433
I admit it.

1239
01:13:16.609 --> 01:13:19.307
[static noises]

1240
01:13:24.312 --> 01:13:27.620
- The radio station is 1908.

1241
01:13:30.841 --> 01:13:33.104
- Radios like that don't
go that high. do they?

1242
01:13:33.147 --> 01:13:34.540
- No. they don't.

1243
01:13:35.846 --> 01:13:36.629
[static noises]

1244
01:13:36.673 --> 01:13:38.196
- Can you record this.

[static noises from radio]

1246
01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:44.420
- Okay. Just get focus.

1247
01:13:46.683 --> 01:13:48.598
- You are getting it?

1248
01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:50.251
- [Radio] Of this apocalypse
was...

1249
01:13:50.295 --> 01:13:52.297
- Did you roll any of that?

1250
01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.864
- I'm rolling now.

1251
01:13:53.907 --> 01:13:57.694
but I'm not really sure
what I'm rolling on.

1252
01:13:57.737 --> 01:14:00.436
but the good news is

1253
01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:04.004
that any time this stuff
happens once it happens twice

1254
01:14:04.048 --> 01:14:06.616
and camera's ready

1255
01:14:06.659 --> 01:14:08.835
and we'll just wait
for it to happen again.

1256
01:14:14.841 --> 01:14:16.974
- And what if it doesn't?

1257
01:14:17.017 --> 01:14:19.672
[ominous music]

1258
01:14:21.108 --> 01:14:25.809
- All right. So it's been a
few weeks since any weird stuff

1259
01:14:27.854 --> 01:14:29.421
so I am thinking. it's time for
me

1260
01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:30.683
to finally get out of the city.

1261
01:14:30.727 --> 01:14:34.513
I just got to tell John. which
is awkward.

1262
01:14:40.388 --> 01:14:42.695
[phone ringing]

1263
01:14:42.739 --> 01:14:44.610
- [John] Hey. I know I'm
supposed

1264
01:14:44.654 --> 01:14:45.481
to legally ask you for consent
to record.

1265
01:14:45.524 --> 01:14:46.394
but this is really.

1266
01:14:47.787 --> 01:14:52.444
It's kinda huge. so just
know it's recording. Cool?

1267
01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.316
Yeah. Right.

1268
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.711
Hey man. this is hard to
say. but I'm leaving. I gotta

1269
01:14:58.755 --> 01:15:01.758
be totally up by the first or
they take my security deposit

1270
01:15:01.801 --> 01:15:02.672
[John interrupting]

1271
01:15:02.715 --> 01:15:04.412
- So last night I'm downstairs

1272
01:15:04.456 --> 01:15:09.592
and just helping Lonnie
through a vulnerable moment

1273
01:15:09.635 --> 01:15:10.506
he was having.

1274
01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:12.986
- Is that enough?

1275
01:15:15.641 --> 01:15:16.512
- Yeah.

1276
01:15:19.166 --> 01:15:21.821
- And I look at the apartment
next door

1277
01:15:22.909 --> 01:15:25.608
and here it was. I found it.

1278
01:15:27.348 --> 01:15:28.741
The floating doorway

1279
01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:30.221
and the door was just wide open.

1280
01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:31.570
So I walk in...

1281
01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:33.920
[lock shattering]

1282
01:15:33.964 --> 01:15:35.574
And inside there's just a whole
bunch

1283
01:15:35.618 --> 01:15:37.576
of these strays Sphinx cats.

1284
01:15:39.622 --> 01:15:42.015
And there was this...

1285
01:15:45.192 --> 01:15:46.585
- [Levi] What?

1286
01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:49.283
[ominous music]

1287
01:15:54.201 --> 01:15:59.032
So if they made that
person over there. OD.

1288
01:16:01.382 --> 01:16:03.602
then that's like a sacrifice.

1289
01:16:03.646 --> 01:16:04.777
And it was a sacrifice.

1290
01:16:04.821 --> 01:16:07.388
That means this whole thing is
a ritual.

1291
01:16:08.259 --> 01:16:10.957
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1292
01:16:11.001 --> 01:16:12.263
I guess everything started right

1293
01:16:12.306 --> 01:16:14.657
when she OD. so that's
a really good theory.

1294
01:16:15.962 --> 01:16:20.053
- Wait. didn't you say it was

1295
01:16:20.097 --> 01:16:22.882
a guy walking his dog. the
junkie?

1296
01:16:22.926 --> 01:16:24.318
- You ever have a dream

1297
01:16:24.362 --> 01:16:26.930
that you suspect is actually
just a buried memory?

1298
01:16:28.322 --> 01:16:30.716
- I hope not. my dreams are
terrifying.

1299
01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.676
[people yelling]

1300
01:16:33.719 --> 01:16:35.895
- I keep on having this
recurring dream

1301
01:16:35.939 --> 01:16:38.419
that I think might have
actually happened to me.

1302
01:16:38.463 --> 01:16:42.510
where I'm a kid and I'm
watching TV.

1303
01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:47.646
There's a symbol in Budapest

1304
01:16:49.256 --> 01:16:52.912
in Middle East. in
somewhere I don't recognize.

1305
01:16:52.956 --> 01:16:55.959
But then I think maybe it's
just my brain being manipulated

1306
01:16:56.002 --> 01:16:58.614
by this place telling me to
figure it out.

1307
01:17:01.007 --> 01:17:01.791
[closet door creaking]

1308
01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:03.096
What's with your closet?

1309
01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:06.230
What's this building?
What's your apartment?

1310
01:17:06.273 --> 01:17:08.754
I mean. jeez. something about
this city.

1311
01:17:08.798 --> 01:17:11.452
maybe like some kind of a
receiver.

1312
01:17:11.496 --> 01:17:13.672

like a satellite dish.

Check it out.

1316
01:17:54.452 --> 01:17:59.457
Yeah. Okay. This city was
designed according to this
tablet.

1317
01:18:00.153 --> 01:18:02.329
Yeah. See these neighborhoods

1318
01:18:02.373 --> 01:18:06.159
and these parks are all on the
same grid like configuration.

1319
01:18:06.203 --> 01:18:07.595
I mean. I guess in 1908.

1320
01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:10.424
when about when all of those
would have been put up.

1321
01:18:10.468 --> 01:18:12.209
Fred Thompson would have been
supervising

1322
01:18:12.252 --> 01:18:14.037
the planning on that. so...

1323
01:18:15.995 --> 01:18:19.825
- I just checked Quora
and there is no succulent.

1324
01:18:19.869 --> 01:18:23.655
no cactus. not anything
like that. that grows fruit.

1325
01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.135
That looks like that.

[ominous music]

1327
01:18:48.462 --> 01:18:49.725

he ate this cactus.

1330
01:18:56.906 --> 01:18:59.735
He thought was peyote and
he got this mouth infection

1331
01:18:59.778 --> 01:19:01.301
and they had to remove his jaw.

1332
01:19:03.347 --> 01:19:04.740
- I might be one of the first
people

1333
01:19:04.783 --> 01:19:07.177
in the universe to taste
an inter-dimensional fruit.

1334
01:19:08.047 --> 01:19:11.921
If I died doing that. I'm fine
with that.

- What?

1341
01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:09.021
- It's a book.

1342

- Someone left us a book?

1343
01:20:17.247 --> 01:20:20.816
- The delivery guy left us a
book

1344
01:20:20.859 --> 01:20:23.601
because I bought a book about
the neighborhood on Amazon.

1345

- Fucking asshole. I
almost stabbed a mailman.

1346
01:20:27.735 --> 01:20:29.999
I found the original
survey of this land parcel.

1347
01:20:30.042 --> 01:20:32.697
And yes. indeed the original
city planners

1348
01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:34.307
did use this shape in order

1349
01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:36.744
to define the real estate
borders.

1350
01:20:36.788 --> 01:20:40.879
Brief glimpse at the history
of this patch of dirt.

1351
01:20:40.923 --> 01:20:43.273
tells us precisely why
they might've done that.

1352
01:20:43.316 --> 01:20:45.884
Did you know that Aldous Huxley
once

1353
01:20:45.928 --> 01:20:48.234
had a Mescalin experience
that was mystical

1354
01:20:48.278 --> 01:20:51.455
and changed his entire
life. just over the hill.

1355

Jack Parsons of the jet
propulsion laboratory

1356
01:20:54.458 --> 01:20:56.068
and sex magic fame.

1357
01:20:56.112 --> 01:20:58.941
for a very brief time rented
one of these apartments.

1358
01:20:58.984 --> 01:21:01.247
And also if one were to examine
the soil.

1359
01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:04.033
he'd find evidence of a
meteorite strike.

1360
01:21:04.076 --> 01:21:06.600
Might be natural to ask what
exactly

1361
01:21:06.644 --> 01:21:09.603
were the early Pythagorean
city planners doing here.

1362
01:21:10.909 --> 01:21:12.780
Well. it's the same thing as us.

1363
01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.087

1364
01:21:16.349 --> 01:21:18.786

01:21:20.919 --> 01:21:21.789

How's that?

1368
01:21:27.534 --> 01:21:28.796
- That was great.

1369
01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.363
I really liked the accent.

1370
01:21:31.974 --> 01:21:33.236
- Was I doing an accent?

1371
01:21:33.279 --> 01:21:35.325
- No it sounds like a
Hobbit. It was awesome.

1372
01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:37.893
- Should we retake it?

1373
01:21:37.936 --> 01:21:38.850
- No. we're great.

1374
01:21:40.373 --> 01:21:43.420
but wait. there's an extra
little piece at the end. right?

1375
01:21:43.463 --> 01:21:45.944
- The part about if we're for.

1376
01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:47.946
I don't think we're gonna use
it.

1377
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:49.382
And even if we were wrong
about everything else.

1378
01:21:49.426 --> 01:21:54.344
it has always been here.
here in this patch of dirt.

1379
01:21:56.389 --> 01:21:58.565
Actually. by the way I
was thinking about it.

1380
01:21:58.609 --> 01:22:00.698
That should be the title.
"Something in the Dirt".

1381
01:22:00.741 --> 01:22:02.134
not "Something in the Light".

1384
01:22:17.541 --> 01:22:18.542

- How'd you know which one was
langitude

1387
01:22:31.859 --> 01:22:33.209
and which one was lotitude.

1388
01:22:33.252 --> 01:22:35.385
- Latitude and longitude. and I
didn't.

1389
01:22:36.386 --> 01:22:37.691
If you swap those two
coordinates.

1390
01:22:37.735 --> 01:22:39.432
you end up at Point Nemo.

1391
01:22:39.476 --> 01:22:40.868
the most isolated place on earth

1392
01:22:40.912 --> 01:22:42.827
in the middle of the Pacific
ocean.

1393
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:44.394
So the place in the middle of
the Pacific

1394
01:22:44.437 --> 01:22:45.569
is gonna be plan B

1395
01:22:45.612 --> 01:22:47.005

us

1396

apart.

[ominous music]

1407
01:25:20.898 --> 01:25:24.075
[shrill static noise]

1408
01:25:49.361 --> 01:25:52.538
I was wondering if maybe
that's sacrifice next door.

1409
01:25:52.582 --> 01:25:53.670
Maybe that's the quartz

1410
01:25:53.713 --> 01:25:55.411
and the building is foundation
needs.

1411
01:25:57.282 --> 01:26:02.244
Blood. like life energy in
order to carry the signals

1412
01:26:02.287 --> 01:26:04.681
that communicate with the mind
parasites.

1413
01:26:04.724 --> 01:26:07.423
I know sounds kind of nuts.
but I'm just riffing here.

1414
01:26:09.076 --> 01:26:10.687
You want to get back on the
road.

1415
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:13.820
- Yeah. This is the same zip
code

1416
01:26:13.864 --> 01:26:16.083
as the beach I spear fish at.

1417
01:26:16.127 --> 01:26:21.088
and that is the beach
which I spear fish at.

1418
01:26:24.266 --> 01:26:26.006
- I don't know it kind of looks
like

1419
01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:27.617
It could be a beach
anywhere though. right?

1420
01:26:33.797 --> 01:26:35.102
- It really looks like it.

1421
01:26:36.713 --> 01:26:38.149
- I am just trying to make
sure that we stay on track

1422
01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.498
so we get the right answer.

1423
01:26:40.369 --> 01:26:43.676
"Speed is fine. but accuracy is
final."

1424
01:26:46.157 --> 01:26:47.202
Wyatt Earp said that.

1425
01:26:56.298 --> 01:26:59.083
- Okay. Hi. I'm Michael.

1426
01:26:59.126 --> 01:27:00.476
I was brought in later in

1427
01:27:00.519 --> 01:27:03.261
the whole process of the
documentary

1428
01:27:03.305 --> 01:27:04.741
because the edit was getting.

1429
01:27:05.742 --> 01:27:07.265
Basically John empowered me

1430
01:27:07.309 --> 01:27:08.919
to give my point of view.

1431
01:27:08.962 --> 01:27:10.964
You know. the one that he
couldn't see.

1432
01:27:11.008 --> 01:27:11.965
keep it objective.

1433
01:27:14.054 --> 01:27:16.361
At first I thought if we
all trusted each other

1434
01:27:17.667 --> 01:27:18.755
and the checks cleared

1435
01:27:20.322 --> 01:27:22.628
and that's when John was in
control

1436
01:27:22.672 --> 01:27:24.587
and it was what it was.

1437
01:27:27.067 --> 01:27:29.113
But then after the radiation
incident.

1438
01:27:30.419 --> 01:27:33.030
[static noise]

1439
01:27:36.338 --> 01:27:39.297
[suspenseful music]

[ominous music]

1441
01:28:40.271 --> 01:28:42.012
- All right. First things first.

1442
01:28:42.055 --> 01:28:43.448
I need you to stay calm

1443
01:28:43.492 --> 01:28:46.103
because I have this completely
under control. okay?

1444
01:28:46.146 --> 01:28:47.757
- What's up John?

1445
01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.976
- The electromagnetic spectrum
does not end in visible light

1446
01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:53.328
and infrared. there's also
the UV part of the spectrum.

1447
01:28:53.371 --> 01:28:54.590
And I have a sunburn

1448
01:28:54.633 --> 01:28:56.635
that was caused by ultraviolet
rays. look.

1449
01:28:59.943 --> 01:29:01.466
That could be x-ray radiation.

1450
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:03.250
We might've been walking around
in gamma rays for months.

1451
01:29:03.294 --> 01:29:04.339
It mutated that plant.

1452
01:29:04.382 --> 01:29:06.297
who knows what it's doing to
our DNA.

1453
01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:07.951
We might not even be human
anymore.

1454
01:29:10.606 --> 01:29:11.781
[Levi mumbling]

1455
01:29:11.824 --> 01:29:14.523
Now have constructed this
radiation suit

1456
01:29:14.566 --> 01:29:15.959
because we can't let building
management

1457
01:29:16.002 --> 01:29:17.482
sending the EMF inspector

1458
01:29:17.526 --> 01:29:19.658
and I closed all the
windows just to be safe.

1459
01:29:19.702 --> 01:29:22.574
So. give it a look.

1460
01:29:26.186 --> 01:29:29.755
[radiation suite rustling]

1461
01:30:28.292 --> 01:30:30.947
[ominous music]

1462
01:30:37.214 --> 01:30:38.041
It cooked the plant.

1463
01:30:39.477 --> 01:30:40.304
What's with the skull?

1464
01:30:41.523 --> 01:30:44.351
- So I downloaded geocache app

1465
01:30:44.395 --> 01:30:47.616
and I put in the zip code
from the redacted manuscript

1466
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:51.576
and coordinates came up for
the beach that I Spearfish at.

1467
01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:55.711
And I swam down in the
reef and I found that guy.

1468
01:30:57.364 --> 01:30:58.191
- You did that?

1469
01:31:03.066 --> 01:31:04.633
- Well. you know. you're not
supposed

1470
01:31:04.676 --> 01:31:05.721
to keep geocaches catches.
right?

1471
01:31:05.764 --> 01:31:07.157
- I know. I just figured since

1472
01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.768
it was probably relevant
to what we're doing. but...

1473
01:31:12.641 --> 01:31:13.772
[Levi chuckling]

1474
01:31:13.816 --> 01:31:16.601
Wait. you keep geocaches all
the time.

1475
01:31:16.645 --> 01:31:18.429
- How is a fake scull relevant.

1476
01:31:24.217 --> 01:31:26.829
- How do you know it's a fake
skull?

1477
01:31:28.091 --> 01:31:30.397
- You cooked the fucking hard
drives.

1478
01:31:30.441 --> 01:31:32.487
- We both cooked the fucking
hard drives.

1479
01:31:33.923 --> 01:31:35.272
- You are the video...

1480
01:31:35.315 --> 01:31:39.406
[both arguing indistinctly]

1481
01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:41.452
You are the fucking video
organizer.

1482
01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:43.585
And I told you a million
fucking times.

1483
01:31:43.628 --> 01:31:44.847
to open the windows.

1484
01:31:45.891 --> 01:31:46.805
- Was I supposed to do man?

1485
01:31:46.849 --> 01:31:48.459
Just let radiation billow out

1486
01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:50.766
all over Laurel Canyon like
Chernobyl.

1487
01:31:50.809 --> 01:31:52.071
- There is no radiation.

1488
01:31:52.115 --> 01:31:53.725
And you left the hard drives
next

1489
01:31:53.769 --> 01:31:56.293
to the hottest place in the
whole fucking apartment.

1490
01:31:56.336 --> 01:32:00.297
- They're not all cooked.
We'll just recreate something.

1491
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:04.431
[speaking in a foreign language]

1492
01:32:40.859 --> 01:32:42.295
- As soon as I talked to him.

1493
01:32:42.339 --> 01:32:44.297
he said. okay. this is all real.

1494
01:32:44.341 --> 01:32:46.386
What I need you to redo.

1495
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:47.518
and whatever the fuck that
means.

1496
01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:49.694
and what really sucks was that
Stefania

1497
01:32:49.738 --> 01:32:52.523
was like this we are not going
to give them the footage.

1498
01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.090
until we get paid.

1499
01:32:54.133 --> 01:32:56.614
I'd personally hold onto that
footage

1500
01:32:56.658 --> 01:32:59.225
until they get paid and we got
fired.

1501
01:32:59.269 --> 01:33:03.099
And now we're on what would
be the sixth editor. seven?

1502
01:33:03.142 --> 01:33:03.969
How many is it?

1503
01:33:05.405 --> 01:33:08.147
[door unlocking]

1504
01:33:13.936 --> 01:33:15.720
- I thought you're working
tonight.

1505
01:33:15.764 --> 01:33:18.201
My carbon monoxide detector
went off

1506
01:33:18.244 --> 01:33:19.637
and I'm gonna have someone take
a look

1507
01:33:19.681 --> 01:33:20.899
at it tomorrow morning.

1508
01:33:20.943 --> 01:33:22.379
but in the meantime.
it's for my own safety.

1509
01:33:22.422 --> 01:33:24.816
I'm gonna stay on up here
tonight.

1510
01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:26.992
- Actually. I'm not working
tonight

1511
01:33:27.036 --> 01:33:28.690
and I kinda need my spot.

1512
01:33:32.824 --> 01:33:35.566
- I mean. maybe I could
just stay in the bedroom.

1513
01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:37.133
If you're gonna stay out here.

1514
01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:43.356
[radio humming indistinctly]

1515
01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:00.156
[ceremonial music]

1516
01:34:40.457 --> 01:34:41.980
- Welcome back.

1517
01:34:42.024 --> 01:34:45.462
[rapid ceremonial music]

1518
01:34:48.378 --> 01:34:52.295
[diminishing ceremonial music]

1519
01:34:58.562 --> 01:35:00.564
- Is it the biggest fluctuation
yet.

1520
01:35:03.045 --> 01:35:05.874
[ground rumbling]

1521
01:35:13.055 --> 01:35:18.147
I'm telling you. man. this
can be really dangerous.

1522
01:35:18.190 --> 01:35:19.191
This structure could be...

1523
01:35:19.235 --> 01:35:20.932
- Every building in LA since
1978

1524
01:35:20.976 --> 01:35:22.673
has been retrofitted for
earthquakes.

1525
01:35:22.717 --> 01:35:25.807
Come on. they are back. come on.

1526
01:35:41.997 --> 01:35:44.042
Thought it would be a kind of a
big night

1527
01:35:44.086 --> 01:35:46.175
at the bar. right? New Year's?

1528
01:35:47.176 --> 01:35:48.003
- I got fired.

1529
01:35:49.004 --> 01:35:50.222
- Really?

1530
01:35:50.266 --> 01:35:52.050
- Yeah. And if we're
gonna keep taking beers.

1531
01:35:52.094 --> 01:35:53.878
will you please replenish
them like I asked

1532
01:35:53.922 --> 01:35:55.227
to replenish fucking times.

1533
01:35:55.271 --> 01:35:56.141
- I'm sure you're gonna find

1534
01:35:56.185 --> 01:35:57.708
another bartending gig. right?

1535
01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:58.970
- I liked my job and bartending
jobs

1536
01:35:59.014 --> 01:36:01.190
are insanely hard to find in
Los Angeles.

1537
01:36:03.366 --> 01:36:04.933
I'm leaving anyways. Fuck it.

1538
01:36:08.675 --> 01:36:10.112
- Wait. you're still gonna go.

1539
01:36:12.418 --> 01:36:14.638
Thread just picked up.
you're just gonna go?

1540
01:36:16.553 --> 01:36:17.989
- I don't have a thread.

1541
01:36:18.033 --> 01:36:20.818
You have a thread and hoax
skeletons

1542
01:36:20.862 --> 01:36:22.951
and non-existent radiation
aren't part of it.

1543
01:36:22.994 --> 01:36:24.430
This new stuff doesn't add up.

1544
01:36:25.823 --> 01:36:27.346
Better explanations will be

1545
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:29.261
that you got fucking brain
damage from reduced gravity.

1546
01:36:29.305 --> 01:36:32.047
- Do you think that maybe you
blame random shit on gravity.

1547
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:33.265
because you don't want
to bother to figure out

1548
01:36:33.309 --> 01:36:34.484
what's really going on?

1549
01:36:40.533 --> 01:36:41.317
- Why do you do that?

1550
01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.274
- Do what Levi?

1551
01:36:44.581 --> 01:36:48.541
- Somehow everything
everyone else says as absurd.

1552
01:36:48.585 --> 01:36:49.412
but fucking...

1553
01:36:52.415 --> 01:36:55.070
[ominous music]

1554
01:36:57.681 --> 01:37:01.163
[rapid suspenseful music]

1555
01:37:05.994 --> 01:37:08.257
- Roll the security camera.

1556
01:37:13.088 --> 01:37:14.176
- It's glitching again it's
frozen.

1557
01:37:14.219 --> 01:37:15.177
- You got to restart it in

1558
01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:16.047
the playback part of the app.

1559
01:37:16.091 --> 01:37:16.918
- No shit.

1560
01:37:33.021 --> 01:37:33.848
What's this?

1561
01:37:36.024 --> 01:37:38.548
- Came in and it looked
like your bag had exploded.

1562
01:37:38.591 --> 01:37:40.202
So I cleaned up your mess.

1563
01:37:40.245 --> 01:37:42.552
- Weird because it looks like
you're going through my shit.

1564
01:37:43.945 --> 01:37:46.556
- Yeah. I accidentally
saw some legal documents

1565
01:37:46.599 --> 01:37:48.601
and sure I suppose that you're
not

1566
01:37:48.645 --> 01:37:50.734
what most people would think
of as a real sex offender.

1567
01:37:50.777 --> 01:37:53.084
But what you are is a person

1568
01:37:53.128 --> 01:37:56.783
who helped his sister
rob construction sites.

1569
01:37:58.133 --> 01:37:59.395
And I'm pretty sure your license

1570
01:37:59.438 --> 01:38:01.658
is suspended for some
unpaid parking tickets.

1571
01:38:06.793 --> 01:38:10.319
- All right. here's what
happened.

1572
01:38:12.756 --> 01:38:14.889
I was helping her get back
something

1573
01:38:14.932 --> 01:38:16.934
that she said was hers.

1574
01:38:16.978 --> 01:38:19.676
And that was probably a
really stupid thing to do.

1575
01:38:20.764 --> 01:38:23.158
But I did it because I felt
guilty

1576
01:38:23.201 --> 01:38:25.377
about giving her her first bump.

1577
01:38:27.902 --> 01:38:30.948
And I have no idea why I'm
explaining

1578
01:38:30.992 --> 01:38:32.863
this to an asshole extremist

1579
01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:34.865
who lives off of with his
ex-husband.

1580
01:38:34.909 --> 01:38:36.171
- You know what it makes
a whole lot of sense

1581
01:38:36.214 --> 01:38:38.347
that you turned your sister
into a junkie.

1582
01:38:40.131 --> 01:38:41.045
Did that kill her?

You know why I think you're
leaving?

1587
01:39:05.765 --> 01:39:07.811
It's because you are allergic
to success.

1588
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.987
You're a fuck up.

1589
01:39:11.684 --> 01:39:14.383
And you wear it like some
kind of a badge of honor

1590
01:39:14.426 --> 01:39:15.645
and you dress like a child

1591
01:39:15.688 --> 01:39:17.734
so that nobody ever
expects anything of you.

1592
01:39:18.865 --> 01:39:20.041
To be really honest.

1593
01:39:20.084 --> 01:39:21.999
I think if we actually found
some success

1594
01:39:22.043 --> 01:39:24.175
in this thing we're trying to
do.

1595
01:39:24.219 --> 01:39:25.916
you'd find a way to fuck that
up.

1596
01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.571
- What have you had the success
at?

1597
01:39:28.614 --> 01:39:32.096
Actually don't tell me.
I don't give a shit.

1598

I'm just fascinated that in

to being an unemployed

1600
01:39:35.795 --> 01:39:38.015
you're also a compulsive liar.

1601
01:39:38.059 --> 01:39:39.277
- Actually I've made more money

1602
01:39:39.321 --> 01:39:40.844
than you've ever seen in your
entire life.

1603

- And you are the oldest
bartender in LA.

1605

I bet your parents are
really proud of that.

1606

- Wait. what did you
do with all that money?

1607
01:39:49.548 --> 01:39:50.375
- I donated it.

1608
01:39:50.419 --> 01:39:51.376

1609
01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:52.508
- To my church.

- You're right. I'm a fuck up.

1611
01:40:00.037 --> 01:40:04.389
but at least I'm not a gullible
fraud.

I come over at least

that I'm glad that you're
leaving

1618
01:40:22.277 --> 01:40:24.627
because the only reason
I'm doing this with you

1619

is because you just happened to
pay rent

on this stupid place by
coincidence.

1621
01:40:31.634 --> 01:40:34.289

that it's gonna be any
better where you're going.

1623

are just like you and me.

and one in this rabbit hole to
nowhere.

1632
01:41:14.764 --> 01:41:15.895
And the other one just comes

1633
01:41:15.939 --> 01:41:18.594
to simply going along with it

1634
01:41:22.163 --> 01:41:27.211
because he just wants to
believe in something different

1635
01:41:27.255 --> 01:41:29.387
than his actual life.

life wouldn't be so shitty

if he was smart enough to
dig his own rabbit hole.

Maybe the gravity one shouldn't
blame

the fact

no one.

I mean. his parents died a
decade ago.

1707

something

the same as everyone I guess.

1727
01:50:03.988 --> 01:50:04.815
What happened?

1728

to die

than floating away in zero
gravity.

1730
01:50:13.128 --> 01:50:14.172
I bet he just froze to death

1731
01:50:14.216 --> 01:50:15.957
or suffocated up in the
atmosphere.

1732
01:50:16.827 --> 01:50:18.133
long time before even starting
falling.

1733
01:50:18.176 --> 01:50:20.091

think he felt the impact.

that?

Angeles.

real.

I don't think anyone can say
which part at this point. but

something happened.

1747
01:51:43.784 --> 01:51:44.872
- So. I couldn't find any
evidence

01:51:48.266 --> 01:51:49.485
So I couldn't find any evidence

1750
01:51:49.528 --> 01:51:51.095
of the Pythagorean brotherhood.

1751
01:51:53.968 --> 01:51:55.491
So I couldn't find any evidence

1752
01:51:55.534 --> 01:51:58.015
of the Pythagorean brotherhood
being active in centuries.

1753
01:51:58.886 --> 01:52:01.802
but that's the point of
a secret society. right?

1754
01:52:02.803 --> 01:52:05.675
It's secret. You can't see it.

1755
01:52:07.677 --> 01:52:10.114
It's like electricity.

1756
01:52:10.985 --> 01:52:13.770
Can't see that. but you know it
has power.

1757
01:52:23.475 --> 01:52:25.739
So. you know. I'm not done.

1758
01:52:32.093 --> 01:52:33.355
Find the pattern.

1759
01:52:36.488 --> 01:52:38.012
When you're at the center of it.

1760
01:52:40.492 --> 01:52:41.319
It all fits.

1761
01:52:48.022 --> 01:52:48.936
Eventually.

1762
01:52:52.766 --> 01:52:56.073
[bells jingling softly]

1763
01:53:01.426 --> 01:53:03.211
You hear that?

1764
01:53:03.254 --> 01:53:06.605
[bells jingling softly]

1765
01:53:46.254 --> 01:53:49.344
[ceremonial humming]

1766
01:54:21.419 --> 01:54:26.076
[progressive gentle
instrumental music]
