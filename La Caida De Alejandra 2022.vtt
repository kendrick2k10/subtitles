00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.440
- How are you? Goodness!
- Enrique! How’ve you been? It’s been a long time.

4
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.399
And in the end I went for the red.

5
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.400
- You look gorgeous.
Thank you!

6
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.600
- Where were you?
- Talking with Cristian.

7
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.640
- Hey. what’s up?

8
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.160
I’m happy to see you.

9
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.520
Alejandra...

10
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.600
Alejandra. honey.

11
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.200
- Am I intruding?

12
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.279
- Well. that depends...

13
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.639
- Come on. You were
dodging me for three days.

14
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.200
- Sandra. you’re so dogged
with this. I’ve told you that I can’t.

15
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.679
- Help me. please.

16
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.879
I can’t do another year studying
and working at the same time.

17
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.239
Catering is just wearing my feet out!

18
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.560
One more year of serving
weddings and I’ll be flat out of toes.

19
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.479
- What if something happens to the camera?

20
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.000
Do you know how hard
it is for me to pay for it?

21
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.600
- Look. I'll arrange the interviews
for your days off. and it’ll work!

22
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.159
- And what's in it for me
apart from losing my day off?

23
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.640
- My eternal gratitude!

24
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.360
You owe me.

25
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.639
Pas très à l’aise avec pablo.

26
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.040
Well. remember that! Remember
who introduced you to him.

27
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.039
Thank you so much. my friend.

28
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.800
I love you.

29
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:42.719
- You’re really hard-headed. you know...

30
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.559
Besides. I don't understand
what the rush is all about.

31
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.599
If you still don't know what
you’re going to do the project over.

32
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600
- Alright. alright.

33
00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:49.719
That was the day before
yesterday. Now I got it...

34
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.680
Crystal clear!

35
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:51.719
- Of course.
Unmistakably clear!

36
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.720
Of course. Transparent.

37
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.919
- It's just that... I am not
convinced by any of the topics.

38
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.839
I only know that it should
be practical and audio-visual.

39
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.079
Just think about it. I can also
give it a more cinematic approach...

40
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.680
- Look.

41
00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:07.239
Here is the topic for your project.

42
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.240
That missing painter.

43
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.640
Yeah... nobody talks much about her.

44
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.920
- You know?

45
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.320
I know her-Well. I knew her.

46
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.760
My parents were friends
with her family at the beach.

47
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.519
- Really?! Not only the
camera. but also the content.

48
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.680
I don't owe you anything now.

49
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.079
It’s been three months since
Alejandra López went missing

50
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.720
and no clues have yet been found to
guide the police as to her whereabouts.

51
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.159
- Any statement. please?
Look. I have nothing to say.

52
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.799
Please respect my family's
privacy. Thank you very much.

53
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.920
-Please. Arturo. Would you
like to make a statement?

54
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.399
- All I want is for them to
find my daughter. please.

55
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.319
We cannot go on living like this.

56
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.880
It’s a nightmare. Her name is Alejandra.

57
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.679
My daughter's name is Alejandra.

58
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.240
- Please...
- Let's go. Mom. Sorry. my mother needs to rest.

59
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.359
Hello. Elena.
Carmelo. qu’est-ce que tu fais ici?

60
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.479
I need to talk to you for
a moment. just a minute.

61
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.760
- I don't have the time now.

62
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.479
Get out of my way. Carmelo.

63
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.079
- Elena. wait. Calm down just for a moment.

64
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.759
-I said I can’t right now. I am in a hurry.

65
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.709
- I'm just asking you
for a minute. listen to me.

66
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.279
Look. Yesterday a journalist
called me saying that

67
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.879
she was investigating
Alejandra's disappearance...

68
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.880
- That's none of your business...

69
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:51.119
-How is it none of my business?!

70
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.680
It's affecting my health!

71
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.720
- Your health?

72
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
- Yes.

73
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.879
I’m waiting for some test results

74
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.880
and I’m really scared.

75
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.439
Look. Elena. I just want
to see your parents...

76
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.280
- Come on. Carmelo. My parents
don't want to see you. Leave them alone.

77
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.879
And I'm sure you’re fine. You’re
just psychosomatic with all this.

78
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.039
- Elena. please. I’m begging you.

79
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.159
I already told you what you’d have
to do if you really wanted to help.

80
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.519
-I'll do anything.

81
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.679
-Give us back my sister's
personal belongings.

82
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.199
Especially her notebooks and sketches;

83
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.439
you know my father wants them.

84
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.360
- Elena. let's not start with that again.

85
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.560
Alejandra is...

86
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.880
She was. my wife.

87
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.080
And these things were left in our house.

88
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160
- I'm driving. what the hell do you want?

89
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.439
Yes. I have a copy on
my home computer. yes.

90
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.440
I am on my way there.

91
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.439
Well. have them wait!

92
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.279
Yes. have them wait. They can wait.

93
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.240
- I just want to find Alejandra.

94
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.840
And nobody is doing anything...
- The police are handling it.

95
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.680
- The police?! Well. that journalist...

96
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.039
Carmelo. please. She’s just a student.

97
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.119
- Yes. alright.

98
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.959
Yes. don't tell me again. Fuck!
I'm heading home to get the backup.

99
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.960
Well. what else do you want me to do?

100
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.560
Shit.

101
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:02.800
Yes. yes. I can hear the yelling.

102
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.520
That girl is crazy. man!

103
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.919
- she called us too.
Don't make a big deal of it.

104
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.479
- But she says there is new
information-I don't know.

105
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.999
the police must have told you something.

106
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.439
- Look. let's do something.

107
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.039
You bring me my sister's
drawings and we'll talk.

108
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.520
- That's all I have left of her.

109
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.679
- Carmelo. you have to go;

110
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.319
I promise to have coffee
with you tomorrow. I swear.

111
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.399
- But where? When?

112
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.679
Uhm... at five? Yes. at five o'clock at the café
where Alejandra always went. At the Avelino.

113
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.519
Bring my sister's drawings.

114
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.959
That way my parents will relax and I
can convince them to see you. okay?

115
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.800
- But will you do it?

116
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:39.479
- I will try. I can’t promise anything.
but I will try to convince them.

117
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.520
Goodbye.

118
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.280
- Yes. alright.

119
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.520
Yes. I'm looking for it. OK.

120
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.360
Of course. of course it
has to be here. damnit.

121
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.600
Hey. can you wait?!

122
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.280
It doesn’t seem to be here.

123
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.160
I don't know. I don't know.
it's not here. It’s not here.

124
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.599
Do you really think I did
it to annoy you or what?

125
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.600
Which is my job too. you know.

126
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.520
Yes. yes. I know it’s money.
And I really need it too. Damnit!

127
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.799
OK man. I get it. I'm on my way. OK.

128
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.040
Fucking computer.

129
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.199
Fuck me. Fuck!

130
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.199
-Julio. Julio. Please calm down.

131
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.359
-Calm down. me?

132
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.720
Look. you haven't seen me
upset. you haven't seen me upset!

133
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.159
- Honey. please stop.

134
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.560
-Just stop.

135
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.160
You want me to stop?

136
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.920
You really want me to stop?

137
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.360
I’ll stop.

138
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.280
- Did you have to smash it?

139
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600
Savage.

140
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.879
- But what do you care?

141
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.960
It was mine.

142
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.200
-I don't like it when you behave like this.

143
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.479
- Like what?

144
00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.480
-Like a wild beast.

145
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.480
- You didn't seem to mind
it too much a little while ago.

146
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.720
-You pig. you're a pig.

147
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.999
Get out. I want you to leave.

148
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.599
-Leave? What do you mean? Psycho.

149
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.199
-Get your stuff right
now and get out of here!

150
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.719
This is not right.

151
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.760
- Hey. take it easy.

152
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.039
- No. I want it to end. This is not right.

153
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.239
- You’re the one that wanted it.

154
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.119
You really wanted it.

155
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.400
-Not true.

156
00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.000
My sister is missing. And all I can
think of is to hook up with her boyfriend.

157
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.719
- Hey. stop the car and
don’t get things mixed up.

158
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.800
Alejandra and I were
nothing when she vanished.

159
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.199
Alejandra wanted to leave me

160
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.200
but I was the one who left her.

161
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.120
Because no one dumps me. Do you get that?

162
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.520
Nobody breaks up with ME.

163
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.239
- Come on. are you
ready? Let's record the call.

164
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.280
-Record a police inspector?
Like this? Without his permission?

165
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.679
Girl... I don’t know.

166
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:38.720
- Record him. no way. Record
me. Well... Girl... I don’t know.

167
00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:41.840
- Record him. no way. Record me.
- Well...

168
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.599
However you want.

169
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.120
- Alright. let’s get started.

170
00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.560
-Yes?

171
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.319
- Hello. good morning.

172
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.559
Is this Inspector Garcia?

173
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:06.640
- Yes. Who is this? Is
this Inspector Garcia?

174
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:07.799
- Yes. Who is this?

175
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.600
-Look. My name is Sandra
Fuentes. I study journalism and. well...

176
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.359
I am doing my final degree project on the
disappearance of Alejandra López de Lemos and...

177
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.480
-One second.

178
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.640
Juan.

179
00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:22.800
send me the file on
Alejandra López de Lemos.

180
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.759
Yes. Continue.

181
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.519
-Well. I understand that
you are handling the case

182
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.160
and I would like to ask
you a few questions.

183
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.039
- The press office already
sent out all that information.

184
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:46.079
- Right. I've got it all here. But my project is focused
on how the media influences research of this kind.

185
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:53.399
And... I would need to do a video interview with
you. because the project is an audio-visual report.

186
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.760
-E-mail a request to our press department at the police
station and they’ll contact you if it checks out.

187
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.039
-I only need ten minutes of your time.

188
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.719
-So the sooner you send that
request. the sooner you’ll get an answer.

189
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.279
- Just a moment. please. Let
me ask you just one question.

190
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.479
Is the case closed?

191
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.239
-We don’t close cases.
That’s the court’s job.

192
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.999
This case is provisionally
closed for lack of evidence.

193
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.399
This does not mean that it cannot be reopened should any
evidence related to the initial investigation come to light.

194
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.679
-But. it was closed anyway?

195
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.079
Because no body has been found.

196
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.279
- The corpse is the key piece of
evidence in a possible homicide case.

197
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.919
However. missing persons cases such as
this. where we don’t know the conclusion;

198
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.719
it’s just one of the
investigation's hypotheses.

199
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.360
- So what is the main
hypothesis they are working on?

200
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.879
- Nothing can be ruled out. Miss.

201
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.080
Now you must excuse me.
I have a lot of work to do.

202
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.639
But look. Let's do one thing.

203
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.119
You send that e-mail and
we will see what I can do.

204
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.039
- Right. Of course. Thank
you very much. Inspector.

205
00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.840
Thank you very much.

206
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.040
- Goodbye. good day.
- Goodbye. goodbye.

207
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.040
- Good job!

208
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.879
-Why are there pages missing
from this notebook. Carmelo?

209
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.879
Did you tear them out?

210
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.760
- No.

211
00:14:53.761 --> 00:14:55.440
-Well. they’re not there.

212
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.399
-Well. I don't know. I have nothing else.

213
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.280
Alejandra took everything
to her new studio.

214
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.760
-I remember my sister showing me
a series of drawings that are not here.

215
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.759
It was what she was working
on. When she disappeared.

216
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.960
-Yes. I knew that. But... I don't know.

217
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.080
-I'm talking about a series
of drawings. let's say...

218
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.040
Erotic ones.

219
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.119
-I don't like this accusing
tone you are using. Elena.

220
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.719
Look. I've brought you everything
I've found. What more do you want?

221
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.199
- No. no. no. What is it that YOU want?

222
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.399
You are the one planted on my doorstep.

223
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.280
-What I wanted...

224
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.000
I just wanted to tell you

225
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.760
I miss you all very much.

226
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.399
I loved your sister with all my heart.

227
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.520
And I still love her.

228
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.720
I’m only asking for the chance to go back
and spend some time with your parents.

229
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.800
Is that so much to ask?
- It's been two years now.

230
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.759
Time enough for you to rebuild your life.

231
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.709
-The only thing going on here is that you still think
I had something to do with Alejandra's disappearance.

232
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.600
-Believe me. if that were the
case I wouldn't be sitting here.

233
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.279
-I've brought you the
drawings for nothing...

234
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.560
-They're not all here!

235
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.999
You know this perfectly well.

236
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
-You and I made a deal.

237
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.560
-Look for the rest of the drawings I told you about. Carmelo. Bring them
to me and I’ll consider speaking with my parents about talking to you.

238
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.919
-I did my part.

239
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.920
-What part was that?

240
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.719
- Ana. you gave me such a fright.
where did you come in from?

241
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.239
-Sorry. María. I came in through the door.

242
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.559
- Why didn't you let me
know you were coming?

243
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.960
-Well. you won't believe
who I saw this afternoon.

244
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.439
- Who?

245
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.959
- Alejandra's ex-husband and
sister together. having coffee.

246
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.159
- Carmelo and Elena?

247
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.000
- Yes. yes. It's strange. isn't it?

248
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.680
- Well. maybe...

249
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.560
I don't know.

250
00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.920
- Carmelo brought her some drawings.

251
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.120
- Drawings?

252
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.879
What drawings?

253
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.680
- Well. I don't know. From
where I was I couldn't see them.

254
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.239
Yesterday a journalist called
me to ask for an interview.

255
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.079
- A journalist?
- Well. a student. yes. She wants to interview us.

256
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.319
She was very pushy. but I liked her.

257
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.359
- How did that girl get your phone number?

258
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.599
And how did she know we were her friends?

259
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.960
-Because we are your friends.

260
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.359
And she said something that
I can't stop thinking about...

261
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.439
- What?

262
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:29.040
- Well. what my friend. the lawyer. told
me. that the police go as far as they have

263
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.360
to go. that everything
else is a private initiative.

264
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:47.520
- But the prices of detectives are outrageous.
- Not for a woman with a husband rotten with money.

265
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.479
-And stingy as a rat.

266
00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.720
who doesn't even want to spend the thirty euros for
the airport taxi fare. I have to pick him up myself.

267
00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.440
Besides. I told you to check with
Alejandra's parents beforehand.

268
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.840
-We have to do it. for her.

269
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.839
We will not be able to close this
chapter until they find a body to bury.

270
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.559
- Don't say that.
- What do you think she would have done for us?

271
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.600
-Ana. please…

272
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.240
-We owe it to her.

273
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.560
She was an illuminated soul.

274
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.640
She taught us so much.

275
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.800
She would have done the same for us.

276
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.280
You're so stubborn.

277
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.560
-And remember to review tomorrow's agenda.

278
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.999
-Excuse me. Professor
Arturo. Professor Arturo.

279
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.440
-These are my working hours.
come back during visiting hours.

280
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.799
-But. Professor Arturo. we’re not students.

281
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.759
-Professor Arturo. we’re your daughter
Alejandra's friends. Ana and María.

282
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.480
Don't you remember us?

283
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.480
She gave us painting lessons.

284
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.400
-Yes. of course I remember.
Well. what do you want?

285
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.319
-Sorry to bother you. we thought it
would be better to talk about it in person.

286
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.159
-We wanted to discuss a matter.

287
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.960
- What matter?

288
00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:35.439
-The investigation into your
daughter's disappearance.

289
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.839
- That's in the hands of the police.
I can't do anything about it.

290
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.639
- Exactly what we came here to talk about.

291
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.600
We believe that. the investigation...

292
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.920
- Now. wait.

293
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.320
you believe.

294
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.240
you may have hunches. impressions.

295
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.479
but you don’t have enough
information to form an opinion.

296
00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.040
- But there is clearly no progress.

297
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.320
- Progress... well...

298
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.480
- But. you see...

299
00:20:57.481 --> 00:20:58.919
- Let's see. do you know anything new?

300
00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.400
- No.

301
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.199
But we thought we could do
something on a private basis.

302
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.360
- The best thing you can
both do is to stay out of it.

303
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.119
- But. it’s been over a year and we
want to have the consent of the family.

304
00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.720
- The family is doing everything possible.

305
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.040
- Well. we’re resolved to hiring a private detective.
- Ana. please.

306
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.199
- You are going to do what?

307
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.880
- A detective.

308
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.639
with your permission.

309
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.759
- You don’t have it. of course.

310
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.279
- We are going to do it anyway.

311
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.959
- So why did you come here to bother me?

312
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.960
- Ana. shut up for a moment.

313
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.840
Professor Arturo. please forgive my friend.

314
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:46.719
Having a detective doesn’t mean interfering with
the police; in fact. they complement each other.

315
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.999
And we will cover all the costs.

316
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.440
- What are you talking about?

317
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.799
- We are just trying to find Alejandra.

318
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.199
- No one wants to find my
daughter more than I do.

319
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.080
And leave me alone. I
have an Academia meeting.

320
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.880
And you should at least have the humility to see that
you two poor dupes are just playing Agatha Christie.

321
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.640
- I know Álvaro can't make it at that time and
Mercedes can't either. but it's the only time I can.

322
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.800
Exactly.

323
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.039
- Professor Arturo. good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

324
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.679
- My name is Laura Leiva.
mind if I speak to you for a moment.

325
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.279
- Alright. but only for a moment.

326
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:28.880
...Go ahead. talk. I am listening.

327
00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.800
- Speak. speak. I am listening.

328
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:32.439
- The thing is... Well. forgive
me for dropping in on you like this.

329
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.599
But. I am finishing my Master's
degree in Asset Management.

330
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.199
I would be very interested in
having you direct my thesis.

331
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:37.880
- Impossible.

332
00:22:37.881 --> 00:22:39.239
- Impossible…

333
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.879
- Yes. look. Miss...
- Laura. Laura Leiva.

334
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.359
- Miss Leiva. it is impossible for me because
right now I have three theses on the table.

335
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.160
- But. you are the foremost authority on the subject I want to
discuss. Professor Arturo. Romanticism paintings in Seville.

336
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.479
-Well. until a couple of years or
more from now. it won’t be possible.

337
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.159
- And you don't have an opening?
I just can't wait that long.

338
00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.279
You see. I was your student
years ago. Isn’t there a way?

339
00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:58.360
-Miss. I'm telling you it's impossible. You see.
I was your student years ago. Isn’t there a way?

340
00:22:58.361 --> 00:23:00.680
-Miss. I'm telling you it's impossible.

341
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:09.840
-I urgently need to get started. Professor Arturo. I just don't have
that kind of time. I was looking after a sick relative. you know?

342
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.600
- A sick relative?

343
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.159
-Yes. my father. who died last year.
was bedridden for three years.

344
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.439
- My goodness. I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

345
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.509
- And you were looking
after him for all three years?

346
00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.760
- Yes.

347
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.999
- Stop by my office tomorrow at eleven
o'clock and we'll see what we can do.

348
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.680
- Thank you very much. Professor Arturo.
thank you! -Goodbye.

349
00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.280
-Flora.

350
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.880
Flora.

351
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.200
Hey. sleepyhead.
wake up. it's already late.

352
00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.920
I see you’ve taken your
medication. very good.

353
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.120
Please come here.

354
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.799
-Good morning.

355
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.240
-Look. I'm bringing you
someone to look after you.

356
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.239
- Another one?

357
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.640
- Flora. it's Laura.

358
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.799
- I don't want any more nurses. Arturo.

359
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.119
- She’s not a nurse. She
comes from the University.

360
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.879
And she can keep you
company when Elena and I can't.

361
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.839
- She is also a very well-read
girl. She is very interested in art.

362
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.840
- Have you spoken to Carmelo yet?

363
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.199
- With Carmelo?

364
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.159
- Yes. with your son-in-law.
He called yesterday.

365
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.200
- He is not my son-in-law and I have nothing to say to him.
- Yes. with your son-in-law. He called yesterday.

366
00:24:32.201 --> 00:24:35.320
- He is not my son-in-law and
I have nothing to say to him.

367
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.880
- Please. you have to talk to him. He told me he knows
something. He says he has something important to tell us.

368
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.760
- Flora. don’t start. Please. don’t start.

369
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.360
- The bathroom is over there on the right.
Can you get some water?

370
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.879
- Arturo…
- Do me a favour and calm down.

371
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.880
- Listen to me.

372
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.679
He knows something. I'm
sure he knows something.

373
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.679
Please…

374
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.760
- Stop it now.
- I can't let it be. We need to find our child.

375
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.600
- Do you want to?

376
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.320
You’ll see how Laura keeps you company.

377
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.919
- But. she can't help me
find my daughter either.

378
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.039
- But many people are.
For example. the police.

379
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.879
- Yes. but the days just keep on passing.
One day. and then the next. and no...

380
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.600
- Enough. That's it. That's
it. You have to get over it.

381
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.960
OK? Alright…

382
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.679
- What did you say your name was?

383
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.799
- My name is Laura. I will
help you in any way I can.

384
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.840
-Don't treat me like I'm crazy.

385
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.040
Hand me the glasses.

386
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.320
Come closer.

387
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.320
You have a nice face. Laura.

388
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.479
I’m sorry I can’t look after
you as well as I should.

389
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.400
- No. it's my job to look after you.

390
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.999
- Did you know my little girl?

391
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
- No. she doesn’t.

392
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.480
- Flora. you can talk to me about anything.

393
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.640
I am sorry for what happened.
but I don't know your daughter.

394
00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.240
- Alejandra has hair
like this. just like yours.

395
00:26:54.360 --> 00:27:02.400
Deep black. long and...

396
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:16.040
- When Alejandra disappeared you
had been separated for six months. right?

397
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.760
- How was the relationship
with her during this time?

398
00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.160
- Well. bad. to be honest.

399
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.640
Separations are always complicated.

400
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.520
- Do you still love her?

401
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.679
- If you don't mind. I'm
not going to answer that.

402
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.680
- Sorry. sorry. I didn't mean to ask that.

403
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.560
- Who can forget the love of their life?

404
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.719
-the person you have loved the most...

405
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.719
Who can do that?

406
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.640
Especially in such circumstances.

407
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.560
- And how did you find out
that Alejandra had disappeared?

408
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.280
- I heard about it on television.

409
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.000
No one in the family had
the courtesy to call me.

410
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:24.600
- I’ve read comments that you are still the primary suspect.
how do you cope with all the pressure from the media?

411
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.880
- Could you hand me the
document I signed earlier. please?

412
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.160
- Yes. of course.

413
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.800
Here you are.
- Thank you.

414
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.559
- But Carmelo. what's going
on. why did you break it?

415
00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:51.559
- Because I've changed my mind. Your questions are insulting.
- So I have nothing more to say. And you. turn the camera off.

416
00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.680
Go and interview Alejandra's last lover
He’s a piece of work.

417
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.840
- And in the end what? Are we
just going to sit back and do nothing?

418
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.320
- The mother and Elena are also there.

419
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.279
- We can call Elena. the sister.

420
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:37.639
- Sûr. et on découvrira ce qu'elle faisait avec Carmelo l'autre jour.-
Right. and then also find out what Carmelo and her were up to the other day.

421
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.880
- I'm going to call her.

422
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.480
- She’s not answering.

423
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.960
- Elena. the telephone!

424
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.480
Elena. where are you?

425
00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.240
- Alejandra. Alejandra. is that you?

426
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.520
- Elena?

427
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.360
I am Ana. Alejandra's friend.

428
00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.519
- Ana? Which Ana?

429
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:41.519
- Excuse me. are you Elena's mother. Flora?

430
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.279
- But where is Alejandra?

431
00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.280
They don't want to tell me.

432
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.000
- I don't know. Flora!
I miss her a lot too.

433
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.000
- Everybody knows but
nobody wants to tell me.

434
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.639
- Everybody? Who is everybody? Qui est tout
le monde. Flora Who is everybody. Flora?

435
00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.320
- Do you know where my Alejandra is?

436
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.960
- I'm going to find her. Flora.

437
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:12.520
We will look for her and
we’ll find her. I promise.

438
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.400
I promise.

439
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.440
- Why are you crying?

440
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:30.200
- I’m crying with joy. Flora.
with joy. Goodbye. goodbye.

441
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.280
- María. I…

442
00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:01.720
Maria this chain is the only thing I
have that might be worth something.

443
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.840
Use it to find her. okay?

444
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.840
She loved me very much.

445
00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:22.360
Alejandra opened her home to me when I had
nothing and helped me find my way in life.

446
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.320
Maria. let's find her. please.

447
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.080
- Ana. I will hire the
detective immediately.

448
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.800
Alejandra is like our sister.

449
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.400
Forgive me for

450
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.960
being slow to make this
decision and for not believing you.

451
00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.640
I'm afraid that Alejandra is dead.

452
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:14.320
- Interpol has been working further and has indications
that Alejandra López de Lemos may be in Colombia.

453
00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.760
All other information is confidential. We will
continue to report as investigations progress.

454
00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.199
- Professor Arturo. I thought you
were out. I didn’t hear you come in.

455
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.799
- Hello Laura. how are you today?

456
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:32.439
- Fine. fine. The new treatment is going much better for her. I've
managed to get her to sleep a little less. and distract her by reading.

457
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.200
- Well. I'm glad to hear it. That is good.

458
00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.039
- Are you all right?

459
00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.679
- No. my shoulder. just a bit bothered.

460
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.719
- That's got to be a muscle spasm.

461
00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.280
I took a chiropractic massage
course; do you mind...?

462
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.160
- Ok…

463
00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.039
What a relief! I can't thank you enough.

464
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.879
- You are under a lot of stress.
weighed down with worries…

465
00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.880
The body normally suffers
from this. and it is normal.

466
00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.440
Better?

467
00:34:10.441 --> 00:34:12.440
- Yes.

468
00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:20.839
You see. Laura. we need you to spend more time in the house
because I have a trip and you know my wife can't be alone.

469
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.840
- Don't worry.

470
00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.480
She is in good hands.

471
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.240
- Your questions are offensive and I have
nothing more to say. and turn the camera off.

472
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.840
Go and interview Alejandra's
last lover. That. that…

473
00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.039
- Well. write the conclusions and that's it.
- I have no conclusions.

474
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.319
We still need to interview
the family. and I want to…

475
00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.359
- They don't want to talk to you. Don't
insist anymore; you're incredibly stubborn.

476
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.919
- Well. then... with her friends.

477
00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.919
- I can’t anymore. Sandra. It’s over.

478
00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.199
- What do you mean. it's over?
- What are you trying to say?

479
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.319
Find Alejandra by yourself.

480
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.039
I managed to get an
appointment with the detective.

481
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.999
With all the work I've put in.
you can't leave me stranded now. come on.

482
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.999
- I can't meet up anymore.

483
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.960
- But why not?

484
00:35:18.961 --> 00:35:22.839
- Because I want to spend the little free time
I have with my boyfriend. if you don't mind.

485
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840
- With your boyfriend?

486
00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:25.199
- Yes. with my boyfriend.

487
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.919
Besides. he told me that you are
manipulative and are abusing me.

488
00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.159
- Manipulative?

489
00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.800
What the hell are you
talking about. Pilar?!

490
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:39.319
- Just what I said. Look. I was doing you a favour. but I
can't meet up with you anymore. Ok? If you don't get it...

491
00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.559
- Do you understand what I'm saying?

492
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.480
Fuck you and your fucking boyfriend!

493
00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.479
- Professor Arturo! Professor Arturo…

494
00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.360
- What is it?
- Your wife.

495
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.999
-Flora. what's going
on? What are you doing?

496
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:08.760
- I’m leaving.

497
00:36:08.761 --> 00:36:10.999
I heard on the radio
that she’s in Colombia. so

498
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.119
I'm going to Colombia
to look for my daughter.

499
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.879
-No. no. Calm down. Wait a second.

500
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.439
- Calm down? Wait?;
I'm not waiting!

501
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.479
I won’t keep waiting any longer.

502
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.160
- Please. calm down.

503
00:36:17.161 --> 00:36:19.319
- My daughter is in Colombia.
I have to go and look for her.

504
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.439
Nobody is doing anything. You’re not
doing anything. Nobody is. Our girl...

505
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.279
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

506
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.719
You’re right-I will do something.

507
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.719
This is long overdue.

508
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.959
- You are not going to do anything.
Nobody does anything and you...

509
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.040
- Look me in the eyes. look at me!

510
00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:46.080
Have I ever lied to you? I told you I'm
going to do something and I'm going to do it.

511
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.400
-What a surprise. Professor Arturo!

512
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.960
What are you doing
here. is something wrong?

513
00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.920
- Does something have to be
wrong for me to come to my house?

514
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.600
-No. no. Of course not.

515
00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.559
Make yourself at home. of course.
- That's right.

516
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.479
I am at home. I’m the one that pays for it.

517
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.359
- Yes. I was just
surprised to see you here.

518
00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.360
- I'm still surprised to see you here.

519
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.760
- What's going on. do you have any plans to keep the
house? Because I see that you are very comfortable.

520
00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.400
First with Alejandra and now with Elena.

521
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.840
You young people think you know everything.

522
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.999
But you don't have a clue.

523
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.200
- What do you mean by that?

524
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.560
I have a copy of the keys because
your daughter Elena gave them to me.

525
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.320
I have a flat near the bar.

526
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.680
-Great! I would expect no less.

527
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.440
Do you want a drink?

528
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.800
-No. thank you. I've been
serving drinks all fucking night.

529
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.000
- Relax man.

530
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.560
Relax.

531
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.720
Have you heard the latest
news about Alejandra?

532
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.480
-Yes. Elena told me.

533
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.040
-Look. I'm going to look for
my daughter wherever I can.

534
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.640
You're going to help me. aren't you?

535
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.359
-Do you want me to come
with you to Colombia?

536
00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:55.280
-To Colombia? No. man. no.
The police don’t have a clue.

537
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.880
If anyone knows where she is. it’s Carmelo.

538
00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.719
- Carmelo? That bastard?

539
00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.600
- That bastard knows
more than he's telling.

540
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.160
- And how do you know?

541
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.960
- I don't know.

542
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.239
but I'm going to find out.

543
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.800
I think it just takes
a little more nudging.

544
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.359
- And what do I have to do with all this?

545
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:26.199
- I may be a bit older. but I'm no slouch.
But I can't do it alone.

546
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.200
I need your help.

547
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.760
-Professor Arturo. I…

548
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.640
I can't help you.

549
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.200
- Why not?

550
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.160
- Because I have a record.

551
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.640
- A record.

552
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:47.479
- Yes. a record. I beat up a jealous
husband and almost killed him.

553
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.680
The last thing I need is to
stand before a judge again.

554
00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:59.440
- Do you think this will be
enough to overlook this...

555
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.480
this record?

556
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:24.680
Carmelo goes to a country house he inherited
from his grandparents. every Friday.

557
00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:37.159
It is secluded. surrounded by orange
trees and there is hardly any coverage.

558
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:42.960
I know this because my wife could never locate
Alejandra when they spent the weekends there.

559
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.679
It is an ideal place to have a quiet

560
00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.680
chat with him.

561
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.240
- Stop!

562
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.160
Professor Arturo. what
are you planning to do?

563
00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.840
What's that baseball bat for. Julio?

564
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.480
- Who are you? How do you know our names?

565
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.600
- I know a lot of things and I
know what you intend to do.

566
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.159
- Who says so?

567
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.760
- That's coming from
someone who has a gun license.

568
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.359
So you can both turn around and
go back to where you came from.

569
00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.360
Don't make me repeat myself.

570
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.640
They looked set to give him a beating.

571
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.760
- Those two?

572
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:29.440
Yes.

573
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.599
- But. Professor Arturo…?

574
00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.159
- I knew it. I knew it.

575
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.200
So much righteousness
always hides something shady.

576
00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.600
- Are you sure?

577
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.959
Absolutely. They were also
very determined and emboldened.

578
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.479
It was funny to watch them trying to
maintain what little dignity they had left.

579
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.959
- And how do you know they
were going to beat up Carmelo?

580
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:54.800
- Julio was holding a baseball bat.
- I don't think they were going to play at that time of night.

581
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.279
- And this clears them of suspicion.

582
00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:02.839
- Sure. if they were going
to provoke Carmelo by force.

583
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.840
By force. you said.

584
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.200
Such a confession would not be valid.

585
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.440
It does not prove anyone's innocence.

586
00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:17.640
In any case. these developments may seem quite
new. but we are at the same point: a stalemate.

587
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:24.000
My contacts managed to get me
the notification from the Colombian police.

588
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.679
it’s a customs report.
A woman with a Spanish passport

589
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:34.839
crossed the border a month ago. her name is
Alejandra López de Lemos. It may be a coincidence.

590
00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:40.400
but I need you to sign your approval for the extra
expenses to Colombia. This avenue is worth investigating.

591
00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.520
- If you have to investigate. investigate.

592
00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.520
The sooner the better.

593
00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.240
- You always preferred her.

594
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.240
The prettiest.
The one who fit in everywhere.

595
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.960
The apple of your eye.

596
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.800
Your little princess.

597
00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:56.880
You never noticed the effort
I made to get your attention.

598
00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:04.240
I traded my youth in for books and
those eternal civil service exams.

599
00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.600
I am still unsatisfied and don't
know what to do with my life.

600
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.680
I am now with Julio.

601
00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.280
With my sister’s leftovers.

602
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.360
And I don't know if
I'm doing the right thing

603
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.720
or still revelling in my misfortune.

604
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.840
in my jealousy.

605
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.560
I still dream about Alejandra every night.

606
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.920
And sometimes I feel that...

607
00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.400
her disappearance has a
sense of guilt for everyone.

608
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.680
Because of their selfishness.
because of your frivolity.

609
00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.800
Because of Dad's arrogance.

610
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.520
Because of my envy.

611
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.560
Our family is a script for a
cheap opera. a rural drama.

612
00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.360
Perhaps we deserved
everything that happened to us.

613
00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.280
I'm going to make dinner.

614
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.349
- How are you doing. sweetheart?

615
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:14.080
I made your favourite.
teriyaki chicken salad.

616
00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.160
- My back hurts a lot.

617
00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.360
- You still have that?

618
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.199
Let's see. are you doing your stretches?

619
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.680
- I am suffocating. I can't breathe.

620
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.760
I'm drowning.

621
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.960
I need some sun.

622
00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.840
To breathe fresh air.

623
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.920
- But here you do practically
the same thing you did at home.

624
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.440
Drawing. lying in bed and reading all day.

625
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.600
Nothing else.

626
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.560
- I don't have internet.
I don't have television.

627
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.759
Did you forget to buy
my charcoal fixative again?

628
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.760
- There are things I can't do.

629
00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.559
I am closely watched.

630
00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:53.880
- Jerk.

631
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.960
The humidity is getting
to me. just so you know.

632
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.800
My joints ache.

633
00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.719
I have rheumatism.

634
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:08.159
- Please. my grandfather was in hiding here for thirty
years after the war and never complained of rheumatism.

635
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.400
- I don't give a shit what
happened to your grandfather.

636
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.640
I wish they had shot him.

637
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.600
I wish they had shot him!

638
00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.240
That hurts.

639
00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.160
Give me a massage.

640
00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:37.000
How's that?
- It's nice. isn't it?

641
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.160
- Yes.

642
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.920
Yes. it’s nice.

643
00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.679
- So that later you can say
that I never did anything for you.

644
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.680
- A confirmed cynic!

645
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.120
Think I forget who you are?

646
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.640
- And who exactly am I?

647
00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.440
- An immature lunatic. a
disturbed nutcase. a psychopath.

648
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.280
You think your manners make me forget

649
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.000
that you are a criminal?

650
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.600
A kidnapper!

651
00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.320
You're going to get a good sentence for it.

652
00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.520
- I am already sentenced. Alejandra.

653
00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.400
I told you a thousand times.

654
00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.680
this confinement is just temporary.

655
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.319
And this hole is hardly filthy.

656
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.080
My grandfather was here throughout...

657
00:50:34.081 --> 00:50:35.839
- Fuck off. you and your fucking grandfather!
My grandfather was here throughout...

658
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.519
What a dirty tongue you have!

659
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.400
One day I'm going to wash it with bleach.

660
00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.480
- Just let me go. Carmelo.
- It’ll be over soon enough. really.

661
00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.160
- What will be over soon
enough? But. what will be over?

662
00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.399
How long have I been here?

663
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.680
I need to get out.

664
00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.520
Help!

665
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.200
- Alejandra...

666
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.000
Alejandra. please hear me out...

667
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.400
Can we talk?
- No.

668
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.119
No. we can't talk. Carmelo.

669
00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.509
Everything has already
been said and more than said.

670
00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.080
- Alejandra. please…

671
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.080
- I'll take these books too.

672
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:25.999
And my Gala too. of course.

673
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
- No way!

674
00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.760
The dog is from home!

675
00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.320
- We'll see about that!

676
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.319
- Alexandra

677
00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.599
please. I beg you... Go back home.

678
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.879
- I can't. I'm running late.

679
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.079
But why can’t I return...

680
00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.400
- I've told you a thousand times.
I don't love you anymore.

681
00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.240
You even disgust me a bit…

682
00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.920
- How can you say that?

683
00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.200
- It is the truth.

684
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.520
I look at you and I see you... ugly.

685
00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.520
almost disgusting.

686
00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.840
What do you want me
to say if that's how I feel?

687
00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.200
- I don't know you anymore. Alejandra...

688
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.240
And we've been married for
five years?

689
00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.119
- And now that I think about it.
I remember it all as a bad dream.

690
00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.679
What is left of that great artist
I fell in love with in college

691
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.120
who was going to be the new Picasso?

692
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.549
You can’t even sell a single painting
at the flea market in the Museum Square!

693
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.039
You live in the country.

694
00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.040
off your parents’ inheritance.

695
00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.439
- And who do you think you are?

696
00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.719
Because you are nothing more
than a cheap painting teacher

697
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.719
for unemployed women! Look at you!

698
00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.040
The professor's spoiled brat!

699
00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.999
Your entire life has been given to you!

700
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.399
You haven't been through
half of what I've had to go through!

701
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.360
- The poor little traumatised
orphan is out! You were late!

702
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.239
You want me to cry about it?
- No!

703
00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:39.278
What I want is for you to listen to me! You want me to cry about it?
- No!

704
00:52:39.279 --> 00:52:40.279
What I want is for you to listen to me!

705
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:40.318
- Fuck you. Carmelo! Take your
fucking books! I want you to listen to me!

706
00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:42.039
- Fuck you. Carmelo!
Take your fucking books!

707
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.839
You know what?
I'm going to call my lawyer right now.

708
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.759
- because I'm going to keep everything!
- Yeah?

709
00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:45.838
But first you're going to listen to me! You're going to listen to me!
- No Carmelo. let me go! Because I'm going to keep everything! - Yeah?

710
00:52:45.839 --> 00:52:48.159
But first you're going to listen to me! You're going to listen to me!
- No Carmelo. let me go!

711
00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:48.198
- No. no. no... you have to listen to me!
- Let me go. Carmelo! But first you're going to listen to me! You're going to listen to me! - No Carmelo. let me go!

712
00:52:48.199 --> 00:52:50.239
- No. no. no... you have to listen to me!
- Let me go. Carmelo!

713
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:50.320
- Let me go. let go of me!
- No. no. no... you have to listen to me! - Let me go. Carmelo!

714
00:52:50.321 --> 00:52:52.559
Let me go. let go of me!

715
00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.799
Carmelo!

716
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.039
Let go of me! You're choking me!

717
00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.039
You are choking me. Carmelo!

718
00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.320
You are choking me. Carmelo!

719
00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.920
- Alejandra?

720
00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.120
Alejandra?

721
00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.520
- I never meant to kidnap you.

722
00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.880
I just wanted us to simmer down
and to be able to talk calmly.

723
00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.400
I wanted to convince you to come home.

724
00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.999
to give me a second chance...

725
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000
We all deserve a second chance.

726
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.799
Then I thought of bringing

727
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.360
you to the only place
where we could be alone.

728
00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.720
Alejandra. calm down...

729
00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:39.680
Really. you don't have much
more time left here.

730
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.199
- How can I believe you after being
locked up here for so long...?

731
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.200
- I don't have much
more time left either...

732
00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.760
Neither here.

733
00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.880
nor anywhere else.

734
00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.440
I have cancer.

735
00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.760
I have little time left to live.

736
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.919
I'm going to get my punishment.

737
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:05.680
I have been condemned
to death for a long time.

738
00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.520
And it has arrived...

739
00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.120
- What are you saying. Carmelo?

740
00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.360
Come here...

741
00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.160
Come here...

742
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.400
Come here. Carmelo.

743
00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.400
Sit down.

744
00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.560
- It’s true...

745
00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:37.040
That's the real reason
I've had you here all this time.

746
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.080
A few months ago
I was diagnosed with a brain tumour.

747
00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:48.240
and I wanted to spend the last days
of my life with you.

748
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.240
- Why didn't you tell me?

749
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.240
- And then what?

750
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.680
Would you have come back home.
to look after me. if I had asked you to?

751
00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.680
- I don't know. Carmelo.

752
00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.320
But now I'll never know.

753
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.240
But how much time do you have left?

754
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.280
- I don’t know...
I am waiting for a second opinion.

755
00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.799
I was told three or four months. but...

756
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.160
It's been more than six.
- More than six?

757
00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.280
Are you feeling well?

758
00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.080
Sometimes I get a bit of a headache.

759
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.880
But I think it's more the
stress than the cancer.

760
00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.880
- But what if you suddenly die...?

761
00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.879
What'll happen to me?!
- No. no. no. no... calm down.

762
00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.680
Don't worry. my lawyer has the manuscript of my
confession in an envelope with your whereabouts.

763
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.159
that would be opened the day
after my death. But that won’t happen.

764
00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:40.079
That's not going to happen.
I swear I'll get you home first.

765
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:43.760
I swear. Besides. as I have already told you.
you have very little time left here. Alejandra.

766
00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.760
Here you have days left...

767
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.360
hours...

768
00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.560
It's up to you.

769
00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.560
- Up to me?

770
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.120
- Alejandra. I am so sorry
for what I have done to you. Believe me.

771
00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.680
- Carmelo...

772
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.680
this is not right.

773
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.000
This is not fair to me.

774
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
- You...?

775
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.880
You're going to talk to me...

776
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.079
of what is right?
- No! Carmelo.

777
00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.759
Carmelo. please listen to me for a second.

778
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.719
You’ve already held me against my
will for way too long. please Carmelo.

779
00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.720
Carmelo no... no!

780
00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.280
- I would be very happy if you
put on the dress I bought you.

781
00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.720
I have not yet had you as I
want to have you before I leave.

782
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.120
but I will have you…

783
00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.880
- But let's see: Carmelo has always
been the prime suspect. hasn't he?

784
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.040
Are you sure he had nothing
to do with the disappearance...?

785
00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.880
- Curiosity killed the cat.
- Sorry. sorry...

786
00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.079
- Of course Carmelo
was the prime suspect.

787
00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.080
From the very first
minute of the investigation!

788
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.280
Switch off the camera.

789
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:18.040
- But are we done yet?
- Please turn off the recording.

790
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.880
What I'm about to tell you. I've
never said this before. Are we clear?

791
00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:31.599
We bugged Carmelo's houses
without the judge's knowledge.

792
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:34.920
- Houses...?
- Yes. one in the city and the other in the countryside.

793
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.560
We listened to it for months.

794
00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.439
And do you know what we discovered?
- What?

795
00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:40.480
- Absolutely nothing incriminating. And do you know what we discovered?
- What?

796
00:58:40.481 --> 00:58:42.480
- Absolutely nothing incriminating.

797
00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.160
So we had to drop
that line of investigation.

798
00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:46.400
- Shit...

799
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:47.960
that’s too much...

800
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.320
- And now if you will
excuse me. Duty calls.

801
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.800
- But Inspector. we've only just started!

802
00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:55.600
We are not finished.

803
00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.279
- I told you ten minutes and we've
been chatting for more than half an hour.

804
00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.280
- I can wait here until you come back.

805
00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.840
I am not in a hurry.
- No. but I am.

806
00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.360
I’m in a hurry to get home.

807
00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.440
And now I'm going to a meeting...

808
00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.359
I'm afraid it's going to be a while.

809
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.119
- But when will I be able
to interview you again?

810
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.880
- You've got plenty of
material. young lady.

811
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.040
Besides. you already
know more than the judge.

812
00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:29.760
I hope your investigation goes well.
- Thank you very much. Inspector.

813
00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:35.840
- Professor Arturo.

814
00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.360
good afternoon.
- Hello. Laura.

815
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.639
How is everything?
- I'm fine.

816
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:44.320
Your wife is sleeping. She took her
sedative. She was just very agitated today.

817
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.960
Well. she’ll be able to
rest until dinner then. right?

818
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.000
She takes too many sleeping pills.
don't you think?

819
00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.920
- Yes. Yes. perhaps...

820
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.760
But. it’s just that. she
doesn't want to live.

821
01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.400
The doctor recommends sedation

822
01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.880
to keep her from doing something crazy.

823
01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:14.360
- Now I understand why she took the sedatives out of
the bedroom and left them in your office. of course.

824
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.800
- I don't really know what to do anymore.
This situation is over my head.

825
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.480
- Yes. I understand.

826
01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.160
You. however. seem so full of life.

827
01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.680
It doesn't have to be easy. does it?

828
01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.760
- No. it is not.

829
01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.479
The only thing that makes my day a little
brighter is knowing that you are here.

830
01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.160
You’ve brought some life into this house.

831
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.480
- That's flattering. Thank you.

832
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.080
I have always admired you. Professor.

833
01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.320
And for me there is also a
time of the day that I love...

834
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.760
when you walk through that door.

835
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.560
You also bring something to this house.

836
01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.080
A sense of...

837
01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.920
firmness.

838
01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.800
of...

839
01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.760
strength.

840
01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.480
and intelligence.

841
01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.480
- Laura?

842
01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.440
Laura. are you there?

843
01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.480
- Professor. what's wrong?

844
01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.800
Professor. is something wrong?

845
01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.120
Professor. are you all right? - Professor?

846
01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.480
Silly professor.

847
01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.920
But what happened?
- What has happened?

848
01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.640
- What had to happen has happened.
- It's...

849
01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.960
What about my wife?

850
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.800
- Your wife is fast asleep
and hasn’t heard a thing.

851
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.760
She won't ever know.
- But what are you saying? This can't happen again.

852
01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.880
- Well. we'll see about that.

853
01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.960
- No. Laura... No... Laura. stop it!

854
01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.480
Sorry. This is all my fault.

855
01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:40.080
Flora and I... it's been
a long time since...

856
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.360
You are so young.

857
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.560
Sorry.

858
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:54.560
I have been selfish. Look. the best thing to do is
to leave this house to avert more serious problems.

859
01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.320
-No. no. Forgive me.
It was my fault.

860
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.880
I feel something very strong
since attending your first class.

861
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.799
The only thing I will ask is that
you don’t tell me to leave this house.

862
01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:11.840
I need to be close to you. do you understand? I need... The only
thing I will ask is that you don’t tell me to leave this house.

863
01:04:11.841 --> 01:04:16.400
I need to be close to you.
do you understand? I need...

864
01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.879
to be around you.
- Laura. don't insist.

865
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:20.960
Please... Laura. stop it! to be near you.
- Laura. don't insist.

866
01:04:20.961 --> 01:04:24.160
Please... Laura. stop it!

867
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.320
Hey. look. if...

868
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.880
if it's a question of money...

869
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.479
- Are you going to throw me out like a
whore? But who do you think I am. professor?

870
01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.280
- Please keep your voice down.

871
01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.000
- Laura?

872
01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.760
- I didn't mean to offend
you. I just wanted to help you.

873
01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.720
Look. let's do one thing...

874
01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:08.200
Look. if you want. finish this week and I'll
pay you for the whole month. But only this week.

875
01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.600
It will be the best thing for everyone.

876
01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.559
- Oops. what are you doing here?
- Nothing.

877
01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:21.680
looking for some cufflinks I thought I'd left around here.
- Oops. what are you doing here? - Nothing.

878
01:05:21.681 --> 01:05:24.680
looking for some cufflinks
I thought I'd left around here.

879
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.880
- Hey. have you seen Laura?

880
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.440
- No.
- I'm just very hungry.

881
01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:36.439
- That’s good! Well. let's go to the kitchen and have
some of the cakes I brought you and some pennyroyal.

882
01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.680
Afterwards. I have to go
out and do some shopping.

883
01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.360
- But then. has the tumour disappeared?

884
01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.480
- Excuse me. Mr Aguado. what did you say?

885
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.640
- Yes. doctor. the tumour
you diagnosed me with.

886
01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.999
Is it still there. is it malignant?

887
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.080
Tell me something. please. I am ready.
Is it still there? Is it malignant?

888
01:06:16.081 --> 01:06:19.239
Tell me something. please. I am ready.

889
01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.760
- Mr Aguado.

890
01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:24.040
I diagnosed you with migraines.

891
01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.040
headaches.

892
01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.120
Perhaps triggered by the stress you told me you
were going through because of your separation.

893
01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:36.279
- I didn't... I didn't understand that. no.

894
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:39.959
No way.
- Mr Aguado.

895
01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:43.200
perhaps you should make an
appointment with a psychologist.

896
01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.720
You have to mourn
and bury the past once and for all.

897
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:04.400
And bury the past once and for all.
And bury the past once and for all.

898
01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:03.880
- Get undressed.
Come on. girls. clothes off.

899
01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.240
Let's take the photos.
- How?

900
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.839
- Come on. don't be shy.

901
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:12.880
Didn't you want to be the muses for my next painting?
- Come on. don't be shy.

902
01:10:12.881 --> 01:10:15.560
Didn't you want to be the
muses for my next painting?

903
01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.719
- But were you serious?
- Absolutely.

904
01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.760
From these photos I will make studies that
I will turn into a large format painting.

905
01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:32.760
Come on. what's the matter?
- But I don't know if I have a tummy for photos.

906
01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.480
- Don't worry. no one
will see these photos.

907
01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:52.320
except me.

908
01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.080
- Surprise!

909
01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.080
Look.

910
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.840
I baked your favourite cake.
- Yummy...

911
01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.520
I want to try it.

912
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.600
- I made it for you because
today is a very special day …

913
01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.399
I couldn't help myself.

914
01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.400
- I couldn't help myself.

915
01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.279
- Serves me right for trusting you.

916
01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:10.879
Next time I'll bring you some slaps.

917
01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.279
You're very funny.

918
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:19.680
- Look. I had made it for you to celebrate
our wedding anniversary

919
01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.440
tomorrow.

920
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.640
Today is the sixth. Don’t you remember?
- But how can I remember if I don't know what day it is?

921
01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.040
- Alejandra.

922
01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.040
I have been thinking it over.

923
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.080
And this is a mistake. this...

924
01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:52.479
This is a serious mistake.
- Let go of me now. Carmelo.

925
01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.200
- That's my point.

926
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.920
Look. I was thinking of
releasing you for our anniversary.

927
01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.759
tomorrow.
- Really?

928
01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.760
- Yes.
- Why not now?

929
01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.320
- Because before

930
01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.479
I would like to...

931
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.480
ask you one last favour.

932
01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:17.360
I would like to sleep
with you one last time.

933
01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.239
- Just sleep?

934
01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.879
- Yes. yes. I just want to
feel your body next to mine.

935
01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.880
Like when we were in love.

936
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.600
- So then.

937
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.680
We sleep together and
you'll let me go tomorrow?

938
01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.320
Promise?

939
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:42.880
I accept.

940
01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.280
- Perfect.

941
01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.320
- Look. I'm here with my mother

942
01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:17.160
and my niece - how beautiful!

943
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.560
Hey. look at the pictures I found

944
01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.080
of your daughter with her friends.

945
01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.879
These women are a bit naughty. aren't they?
Well. almost as much as her husband.

946
01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.680
It has to run in the family.

947
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.759
This one is the best.

948
01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:34.200
I say...
- Give me that...

949
01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.079
- Get off me!
Damnit!

950
01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.919
- But. Laura. what's going on here.
what are you doing?

951
01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.960
- Just what we needed.

952
01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.479
The honourable dean!

953
01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.759
Our coming honorary holy week officer!

954
01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.440
The irreproachable husband.
- What are you talking about?

955
01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.240
- We all have something to hide. don't we?

956
01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.040
Your daughter. for example.
taking dirty pictures with her friends.

957
01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.040
Do you know the friends in these photos?

958
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.600
Perhaps...

959
01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:08.719
you had them hidden because you took them.
They might even be why Alejandra went missing.

960
01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.920
- Give them to me...
- Don't come closer or I'll scream.

961
01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.479
Did you tell your wife
what we did the other day?

962
01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.080
Don't come any closer!

963
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.159
Otherwise I will post the photos
for everyone to see.

964
01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.680
So stay away.
- But who are you? Why are you doing this to me?

965
01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.560
- Who am I?

966
01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.680
I’m Laura Leiva.

967
01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:39.480
Do you remember me now. professor?

968
01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.759
When I begged you to pass me.

969
01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.919
when I knelt before you as

970
01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.480
I did ten years ago now.

971
01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.400
- Laura Leiva…

972
01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.240
- You're remembering now. aren't you?

973
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.280
I am that poor girl
who desperately needed your pass.

974
01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.000
But no. You did not consent.
not even by a mere tenth.

975
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.480
By one tenth. Professor.

976
01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:19.520
‘This exam is not for passing’.
Don’t you remember?

977
01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.880
They took my scholarship away

978
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.719
and I had to go back to the village

979
01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.439
to work in crappy jobs.
- Laura.

980
01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:29.560
I understand. but this is not the way. Let's talk about it like civilised people to work in crappy jobs.
- Laura.

981
01:16:29.561 --> 01:16:32.359
I understand. but this is not the way.
Let's talk about it like civilised people.

982
01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:32.520
- No. no. now listen to me in a civilised manner. I understand.
but this is not the way. Let's talk about it like civilised people.

983
01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:35.439
No. no. now listen to
me in a civilised manner.

984
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.040
Because that's what works for you.

985
01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.760
To begin with.

986
01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:48.799
you're going to have to admit me into your department
because otherwise I will. in a “civilized manner”...

987
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.759
make sure everyone can see these photos.

988
01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.079
- But what have we done to you.
why do you want to hurt us?

989
01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:54.240
- Ask your husband. Miss!
- But what have we done to you? Why do you want to hurt us?

990
01:16:54.241 --> 01:16:56.240
- Ask your husband. Miss!

991
01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.680
- Stop it. damnit.

992
01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.240
Stop...

993
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.880
What do you think?

994
01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.600
I don't have a copy of the photo?

995
01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.360
Now you're going to find out who I am.

996
01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.480
- Why. Arturo?

997
01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.320
What have we done to
deserve this punishment?

998
01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.840
- See how beautiful
you look in the dress I bought you?

999
01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.160
And now.

1000
01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.880
promise me you won't do anything foolish?

1001
01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.320
You’re going to behave. right?

1002
01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.880
- Yes. Yes. I’ll behave.

1003
01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:00.680
If you want us to sleep together.
I have to be relaxed. don't I?

1004
01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.440
- Put this on. it’s cold outside.

1005
01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.880
- I'm sorry to have to tie you up.
but sometimes you're very naughty.

1006
01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.080
Quelqu'un arrive!- Someone is coming!

1007
01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:57.400
- Shhh. Don’t you dare raise your voice.

1008
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:13.680
Don't do anything
foolish or you will regret it.

1009
01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:19.120
You promised. Shhh...

1010
01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.640
Just a second. I’m coming. Shhh...

1011
01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.760
- What are you doing here?

1012
01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.479
Back to your usual nonsense?
Look.

1013
01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.279
I think it was perfectly clear the other day that no...
- Yes. yes. Sorry. Look.

1014
01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.679
we got off to a bad start the other day.

1015
01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.079
I apologise for disturbing you you and for
turning up here so unexpectedly. It’s just...

1016
01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:50.680
I've been calling you. but it keeps
going to voicemail or there's no coverage.

1017
01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.159
I am just begging you to give
me another chance. please.

1018
01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.919
And that we finish what we started.
- Look. I don't even know how you found me and forgive me.

1019
01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.799
but I just don't feel like
talking to you for another second. So...

1020
01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.799
I apologise...
- I take full responsibility.

1021
01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.599
but I have the questions written down here.

1022
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.879
Then you can see them first and
tell me whether you like them or not.

1023
01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.319
If you don't like one. we'll skip it

1024
01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:11.160
and I assure you that this time you will have...
- Help! Help!

1025
01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:17.760
Help!

1026
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:24.320
Carmelo! Carmelo. no! Carmelo. please!

1027
01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.319
Help!

1028
01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:30.759
Carmelo! Carmelo. please!

1029
01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:35.000
Carmelo...

1030
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:39.079
Carmelo! Carmelo! Stop!

1031
01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.919
Carmelo!

1032
01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:44.800
Carmelo. please...

1033
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.279
- You stink.

1034
01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.960
You smell rotten.

1035
01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:00.520
Look. in contrast. this smells nice.

1036
01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.960
Smell it.

1037
01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:12.920
And you. on the other hand. don't
smell good because you've gone out here.

1038
01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:18.920
Why did you have to leave here?
- Carmelo...

1039
01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.279
- I want you to be clean for me.

1040
01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.879
I want you to be...

1041
01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.600
very clean for me.

1042
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:35.080
I don't want to see even a single
tear! I have already had enough.

1043
01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.959
- Please...
- No begging!

1044
01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.280
Not anymore.

1045
01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:43.680
That poor girl is dead because of you.

1046
01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.080
Why did you have to shout?

1047
01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.920
You're starting to smell clean.

1048
01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:01.240
That's what it feels like when someone hurts you
even though you haven’t done anything to deserve it.

1049
01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.479
Now...

1050
01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.960
there is no escape.

1051
01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.480
Sooner or later they’ll come looking for us

1052
01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.360
and they will pull us apart.

1053
01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.280
Or someone will miss that girl and...

1054
01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.520
then come.

1055
01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.080
But now I get it.

1056
01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.760
we can leave together.

1057
01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.080
Always together.

1058
01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.360
As you once made me swear.

1059
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:55.640
Like Romeo and Juliet.

1060
01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.440
Together

1061
01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.440
for eternity.

1062
01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.400
I am going to fix everything.

1063
01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.600
- Julio?

1064
01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.000
Julio!

1065
01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.680
That guy is stupid.

1066
01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:46.319
- Hello. Elena.
- Hello.

1067
01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.320
- Hello. What are you doing here?

1068
01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.160
Is something wrong?

1069
01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.680
- We have to tell you something.

1070
01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:06.280
- We had wanted to do this for a long time.

1071
01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.919
But we couldn't wait any longer.
- You're scaring me.

1072
01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:13.680
- Elena. your father and Julio
tried to intimidate Carmelo.

1073
01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.960
- They tried to beat him up
to get something out of him.

1074
01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.679
- And how do you know?

1075
01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:23.359
- We hired a private detective a month ago.

1076
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.079
- A private detective?

1077
01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:29.759
- Yes. to look for any
clues to help find your sister.

1078
01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.360
- Why didn't you tell me?

1079
01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.960
- We called you!

1080
01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.480
Your mother didn't tell
you anything. did she?

1081
01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.480
- My mother…

1082
01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:43.760
My poor mother is more out of it than here.

1083
01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:48.760
OK. so did this detective
find out anything?

1084
01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:52.159
- He even went to Colombia

1085
01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.760
following an Interpol lead.

1086
01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:58.760
But he confirmed that...

1087
01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:02.079
it was a dead end. He comes back today.

1088
01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.320
- He told us that everyone is a
priori a suspect. you. me. Maria…

1089
01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.760
Your father.
- My father?

1090
01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.439
- Ana. What are you suggesting?

1091
01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:14.960
- Elena. no offence. but we think
your father is hiding something.

1092
01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:32.280
- Of course he is hiding something.

1093
01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.200
from you.

1094
01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.519
- How so?

1095
01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:43.280
- You in the photos
you took with my sister.

1096
01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.760
those that my father found in this house.

1097
01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.079
He hid them from the police so they wouldn’t see
them. and to protect your and my sister's privacy.

1098
01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:55.120
- Now I understand why your
father was furious when he saw us.

1099
01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.400
- We really messed up

1100
01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.400
taking those shots.

1101
01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.999
We drank and you know
how persuasive Alejandra was.

1102
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.079
- Yes. but my father was afraid
they would be leaked to the press.

1103
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:10.000
Family honour above all else.

1104
01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:14.480
And he kept them.

1105
01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.120
I don't know how that man keeps everything.

1106
01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:27.320
- Carmelo. Carmelo. please forgive me.
Please forgive me. Forgive me... I’m sorry…

1107
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.639
Now...

1108
01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:33.479
- I attached the car's exhaust pipe

1109
01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.440
to the room ventilation duct.

1110
01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.799
And so. where life
used to come in for my grandfather.

1111
01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:42.920
now death will come in for us.

1112
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.919
Relax. it will be painless. Just don't
fight it and everything will be fine.

1113
01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.160
We'll fall asleep

1114
01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:53.679
and that's it.

1115
01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.680
I'm going to start the car.

1116
01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:24.319
Only a few hours ago. law enforcement
officials arrested famous Art History

1117
01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:27.039
professor and former dean of the University

1118
01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.039
of Seville. Arturo López de Lemos.

1119
01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:32.599
a renowned figure in religious brotherhoods
and a leading candidate

1120
01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:36.319
to be the official Pregonero
of the upcoming Holy Week.

1121
01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:41.840
He now faces rape charges
after being accused by a student.

1122
01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:01.320
- My God. I know where she is!

1123
01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.040
- Elena. you have to come and see this!

1124
01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:02.920
- My God. I know where she is!

1125
01:32:02.921 --> 01:32:04.119
- On TV!
- I know where she is!

1126
01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.120
- I know where Alejandra is!

1127
01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.120
Look. you have to see this.

1128
01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.039
Do you see this drawing?

1129
01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.360
Look. what happens
when I swipe my finger at it.

1130
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:17.319
Alejandra always put fixative
when she finished a drawing.

1131
01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:19.840
This is a golden rule for any professional.

1132
01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:23.840
But this one... there’s no....
it doesn't have it. do you understand?

1133
01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:26.920
It is recent. it was done recently.

1134
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.159
Look. even the colour is much lighter.

1135
01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:30.200
It was in the folder Carmelo brought me.
Look. even the colour is much lighter.

1136
01:32:30.201 --> 01:32:32.440
It was in the folder Carmelo brought me.

1137
01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:35.480
Do you know which house this is?

1138
01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:39.120
It is Carmelo's house in the countryside.

1139
01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.399
Alejandra is alive.

1140
01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:41.520
That bastard is holding her captive and
she's telling us where. Alejandra is alive.

1141
01:32:41.521 --> 01:32:45.520
That bastard is holding her captive and
she's telling us where.

1142
01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:49.840
- Elena.

1143
01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:54.200
some shocking news
just came on television.

1144
01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:57.320
- News?

1145
01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.080
What news?

1146
01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:23.959
- Elena… Elena. No. you listen to me.

1147
01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:25.879
Her father is currently being questioned.

1148
01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.720
And that does not mean he is guilty.

1149
01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.799
What you are telling me
doesn’t make any sense.

1150
01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.200
They’re also trying to divert attention
away from her father.

1151
01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.840
I think her family has
enough problems as it is.

1152
01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.840
So. take it easy.
Come and see me and we'll talk about it.

1153
01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.040
- Well. what did he say?

1154
01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:44.920
- He didn't even listen to me.

1155
01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:47.040
He hung up on me. he doesn't believe me.

1156
01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.680
What should we do now?

1157
01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:55.440
My god.

1158
01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.320
my mother will be all alone.
Who knows what might happen to her.

1159
01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.200
I have to go.

1160
01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.639
Ana. get out of the way. we're leaving.

1161
01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.519
- But are you crazy?

1162
01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.400
Where the hell do you think you are going?

1163
01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.400
We are leaving. yes. We are going.

1164
01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.600
But. we're going to that bastard's house.

1165
01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:15.159
With or without the help of the
police or their fucking grannies.

1166
01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:16.920
We're going there now!

1167
01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.920
Your sister may be in danger.

1168
01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.600
Elena.

1169
01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.760
I believe you.

1170
01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.640
You've been brilliant.

1171
01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.719
Something neither the police nor
the private detectives could figure out.

1172
01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.040
You did it.

1173
01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.440
Your mother has to hold on a little longer.

1174
01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.920
Seeing your sister again
will breathe life back into her.

1175
01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:51.400
- Well. that's that.
I started up the car.

1176
01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:53.759
So. in a few minutes.

1177
01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.519
the tube will be filled

1178
01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.519
and the gas will flow into the room.

1179
01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.919
The best thing to do is to relax.
as I have already told you.

1180
01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.919
Hey. hey. take it easy.

1181
01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.639
Death. death is not so terrible.

1182
01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:08.679
We will move on together
from one life to another.

1183
01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:12.559
Don't worry. don't worry. please.
I will help you.

1184
01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.840
Shhh...

1185
01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.919
- Come on. come on Julio. pick up.

1186
01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.039
- Do you have any experience?

1187
01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.159
No.

1188
01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:50.079
Not a lot. not a lot.

1189
01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.280
- Whatever.
And you have clothes...?

1190
01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.200
You know... some spandex?

1191
01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:00.120
- Like. tight and stuff.

1192
01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.360
Yes. yes. I’ve got something.

1193
01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.599
It's yours. -?

1194
01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:09.800
- Your phone is vibrating.
- Yes.

1195
01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:14.200
It doesn’t matter. I’m unavailable.

1196
01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.319
Where were we?

1197
01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:21.760
- Julio. where are you?
Because I called you three times already.

1198
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.639
Let’s go to Carmelo's house.
the one he has in the countryside.

1199
01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:27.880
Alejandra is there. I just know it.
He is holding her there.

1200
01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:32.160
Julio. I fear for her life.
The police ignored us.

1201
01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.560
For God's sake. where are you!

1202
01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:02.600
- You know what I mean?

1203
01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.920
This is very unpleasant.

1204
01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:07.720
I thought it would be different.

1205
01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:10.800
Hey. look.

1206
01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.800
I have a confession to make.

1207
01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.040
I don't have cancer.

1208
01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:17.600
No way.

1209
01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:21.360
It was just a headache that you gave me.

1210
01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.680
And look. I'm thinking.

1211
01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:28.320
That I still have a lot of
things left to experience in life.

1212
01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.000
- Hello?

1213
01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:59.080
Is anyone there?

1214
01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.840
Carmelo. are you at home?

1215
01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.480
Carmelo!

1216
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.439
- Nobody is around.

1217
01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.719
- The door was open.
- Shhh.

1218
01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.600
I'm listening to something. just a moment.

1219
01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:19.000
It's a car.

1220
01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.840
A car engine can be heard.

1221
01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.840
- Just what is this? Look!

1222
01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.040
Alejandra…

1223
01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:19.079
Remove that. remove
that. Alejandra is here!

1224
01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:21.120
Alejandra!

1225
01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:03.880
-Alejandra.

1226
01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.119
- Alejandra. please.

1227
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.319
- Alejandra… Breathe with me.

1228
01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.959
Alejandra. Alejandra. please
breathe with me. Look at me.

1229
01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:16.040
Breathe with me. please
Alejandra. Breathe...

1230
01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.559
- I am so sorry you are here.

1231
01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.959
especially you.

1232
01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:26.840
sister-in-law.

1233
01:42:26.841 --> 01:42:28.519
But. your sister has to learn

1234
01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.919
how hard things can be sometimes.

1235
01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.920
It' s not like that. Alejandra!
- No!

1236
01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:52.320
- I'm so glad to see you!

1237
01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:54.640
My dear friend.

1238
01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.040
- You’re hurt…

1239
01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:01.320
- You know I've always
been very hard headed.

1240
01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:33.920
- They have him inside.

1241
01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.120
- Just a moment. please.

1242
01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:25.240
You can continue.

1243
01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:19.639
I am sorry I did not listen to you.

1244
01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:22.760
It was difficult to think
of such a possibility at the time.

1245
01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:25.440
- I don't know. I'm not the professional.

1246
01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:29.720
I understand the
difficulties of your job. but...

1247
01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:33.000
all I know is that you
didn't want to believe me.

1248
01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.440
The simplest thing was to
think that my father was guilty.

1249
01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.960
I guess simplicity is not always
the right thing to do in your job.

1250
01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:44.440
- Your father's accuser seems
to be unsure about her statement.

1251
01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:47.839
She contradicts herself. I
think it's more an issue of...

1252
01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:50.320
personal revenge or blackmail.

1253
01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.520
I don't know. but I suspect that your
father is not responsible for any rape.

1254
01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:58.839
- I hope you will get your investigations
on the right track this time. Inspector.

1255
01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:01.280
My family has suffered
enough. don't you think?

1256
01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:05.920
- If you will excuse me...

1257
01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.919
don't worry. I'm fine.

1258
01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:23.440
Just a bit dizzy
and my head hurts a bit.

1259
01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:25.800
- Ana.

1260
01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:28.600
you are the heroine of the day.

1261
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.520
You are my heroine.
