Welcome to the show.

3
00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:09.158
Today. we're going to be playing two hours

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

5
00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:11.121
of the music with Brian Corner

6
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:12.559
on the anniversary of his death.

7
00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.620
We're gonna start the show
off today with the music

8
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.219
from the Arthur Fisher
film that never got made.

9
00:00:25.537 --> 00:00:30.537
she draws real good

10
00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:36.945
as a young Clint Eastwood

11
00:00:38.624 --> 00:00:43.624
he writes great songs

12
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:49.901
he never sends them out

13
00:00:51.823 --> 00:00:56.823
he writes like Capote

14
00:00:58.318 --> 00:01:03.318
the words that he wrote. yeah

15
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:10.041
photos like Cartier-Bresson

16
00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:21.604
middle of the night to say

17
00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:28.052
middle of the night to say

18
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:33.721
- Dorothy. sweetheart. come here a sec.

19
00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:48.326
- Look over these.

20
00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:53.996
These two pictures are of the same person.

21
00:01:58.215 --> 00:01:59.838
- I can't really tell.

22
00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:02.949
It's blurry and it's of his back.

23
00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:05.331
He's got a hat and glasses in that one.

24
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:06.610
Who is it?

25
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.670
- Brian Corner. Musician from the '80s.

26
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.331
- Never heard of him.

27
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.556
- Well. you haven't heard of anyone.

28
00:02:13.556 --> 00:02:15.501
- That's 'cause I'm not
obsessed with fame. like some.

29
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:19.159
- I'm not obsessed with fame.
It's just curious. you know.

30
00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.501
He fell off the face of the earth

31
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:23.201
when he was about to hit the big time.

32
00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:24.534
Supposedly died.

33
00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.082
He just went missing.

34
00:02:27.082 --> 00:02:29.071
He's like a cult artist now.

35
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:31.289
I think I heard the story.

36
00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.039
- He took a boat out to sea. but.

37
00:02:35.232 --> 00:02:36.649
he just was gone.

38
00:02:37.987 --> 00:02:39.654
- Hmm. Sounds fishy.

39
00:02:44.203 --> 00:02:46.579
- You know. they found a boat.

40
00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.041
It was not him.

41
00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:48.874
- Suicide?

42
00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:50.980
- Well. why would he do that?

43
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.255
I mean. just throw himself off a bridge

44
00:02:54.255 --> 00:02:55.927
or eat cyanide or something?

45
00:02:55.927 --> 00:02:57.549
- Many people have their
own reasons for doing

46
00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.557
what they do when they kill themselves.

47
00:02:59.557 --> 00:03:01.388
Can't always make sense of it.

48
00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:03.685
- No. it was just too easy.

49
00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:05.854
If there's no body. there's no death.

50
00:03:05.854 --> 00:03:10.166
- It's not unusual to not find
a body. especially at sea.

51
00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:13.865
- Yeah. but the idea that he was suicidal.

52
00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:17.376
and a heroin addict.
it's complete bollocks.

53
00:03:17.376 --> 00:03:19.615
- Was there a suicide note?

54
00:03:19.615 --> 00:03:22.308
- No. it's too obvious.

55
00:03:22.308 --> 00:03:23.558
- Or the truth?

56
00:03:24.464 --> 00:03:26.394
He woulda turned up by
now if it was a hoax.

57
00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:29.770
People are always looking
for a hoax or conspiracy.

58
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.253
And he would've needed help.

59
00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:32.488
- Yeah. and he's had a lotta help.

60
00:03:32.488 --> 00:03:34.006
and he's got away with it for a long time.

61
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:36.667
But I'm telling you. I'm
gonna get him this time.

62
00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:38.667
David Watford's spot on.

63
00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:41.130
- So what if he is alive?

64
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.463
If he wants to be dead. let him be dead.

65
00:03:47.364 --> 00:03:50.602
- If I sell these. when I sell these.

66
00:03:50.602 --> 00:03:51.769
tell you what.

67
00:03:54.028 --> 00:03:56.084
we could go anywhere in the world.

68
00:03:56.084 --> 00:03:57.721
Where'd you wanna go?

69
00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:00.063
- I'm going to the
kitchen and do the dishes.

70
00:04:00.063 --> 00:04:01.230
- Oh. come on.

71
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.567
Live it up. Come on.

72
00:04:14.202 --> 00:04:15.312
Apparently Nevada has more

73
00:04:15.312 --> 00:04:18.564
Brian Corner sightings
than any other US state.

74
00:04:18.564 --> 00:04:20.718
I'm not sure how they
measure these things.

75
00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:24.879
Sometimes I think
someone's pulling my leg.

76
00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.319
Arthur Fisher's "Ticket to the Bridge"

77
00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.493
wasn't made for various reasons.

78
00:04:28.493 --> 00:04:31.119
The only thing that
still exists in reality

79
00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:33.536
is Brian Corner's soundtrack.

80
00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:55.118
- Good evening. folks.

81
00:04:55.118 --> 00:04:58.398
My guest this evening is David Watford.

82
00:04:58.398 --> 00:04:59.335
who was good enough to send me

83
00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:02.354
an advance copy of his book. "Cornered."

84
00:05:02.354 --> 00:05:05.024
So let's turn to our guest this evening.

85
00:05:05.024 --> 00:05:07.249
That's a pretty big claim
you're making in your book.

86
00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:09.691
which I read. and did not enjoy.

87
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:11.927
- Really? Well. you're one of a very few.

88
00:05:11.927 --> 00:05:13.563
- Oh. well. it doesn't
take away from the fact

89
00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:17.064
that Corner's is a
pretty low-hanging fruit.

90
00:05:17.064 --> 00:05:18.845
- What was it that you
didn't like about it?

91
00:05:18.845 --> 00:05:21.657
The premise is that
Brian Corner's still alive.

92
00:05:21.657 --> 00:05:23.568
- Well. only time will tell.

93
00:05:23.568 --> 00:05:24.973
But it's been a long time.

94
00:05:24.973 --> 00:05:26.613
Are you hoping this book will prompt him

95
00:05:26.613 --> 00:05:27.594
to come out of hiding?

96
00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:29.272
- Well. maybe. but I actually think

97
00:05:29.272 --> 00:05:31.733
it will push him deeper into hiding.

98
00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:35.088
- Look. it's been 25
years since he's died.

99
00:05:35.088 --> 00:05:36.126
- Uh. disappearance.

100
00:05:36.126 --> 00:05:37.347
- OK. disappeared. if you must.

101
00:05:37.347 --> 00:05:38.766
Thank you.

102
00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:42.003
- Why not leave him alone? Why
do you want to unearth him?

103
00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:43.663
- Well. 'cause there's an interest.

104
00:05:43.663 --> 00:05:46.282
- So what? Is it worthy?

105
00:05:46.282 --> 00:05:49.483
- Well. you know. I like a
good story. a good mystery.

106
00:05:49.483 --> 00:05:51.862
And worthiness is relative.

107
00:05:51.862 --> 00:05:53.424
This is Brian Corner's story.

108
00:05:53.424 --> 00:05:56.186
I think he set up his disappearance.

109
00:05:56.186 --> 00:06:00.737
- So it's like a Madeleine
McCann meets Harry Houdini?

110
00:06:00.737 --> 00:06:02.978
- You know. he's a complicated man.

111
00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:05.503
Maybe he can explain
everything when he reappears.

112
00:06:05.503 --> 00:06:08.578
- He might've died in the 25
years that he's been hiding.

113
00:06:08.578 --> 00:06:11.657
- Yeah. that's possible.
but he was very healthy.

114
00:06:11.657 --> 00:06:13.081
- Wasn't he a heroin addict?

115
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.081
- Debatable.

116
00:06:15.225 --> 00:06:17.844
- What would you like to see happen

117
00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:19.523
if he comes out of hiding?

118
00:06:19.523 --> 00:06:24.098
- D'you know what. I'd like
him to create another album.

119
00:06:24.098 --> 00:06:26.092
I think maybe he could've
been making music

120
00:06:26.092 --> 00:06:28.350
for the whole 25 years.

121
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.411
- Do you really think that's gonna happen?

122
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:33.433
See. I'm not buying it.
That's wishful thinking.

123
00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:36.371
- Well. yes. it's what I
would like to see happen.

124
00:06:36.371 --> 00:06:38.633
'cause I'm a massive fan.

125
00:06:38.633 --> 00:06:40.697
- Look. he probably looks a lot different.

126
00:06:40.697 --> 00:06:41.791
He probably sounds a lot different.

127
00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:43.471
His voice has surely matured.

128
00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:46.524
He would have a completely
different sound.

129
00:06:46.524 --> 00:06:49.024
- If he's reinvented
himself. all the better.

130
00:06:49.024 --> 00:06:50.465
- You might not approve
of what he's become.

131
00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:53.825
- You know. I'm open to change.

132
00:06:53.825 --> 00:06:56.844
- Where would he be
hiding. if he's hiding?

133
00:06:56.844 --> 00:06:59.889
- He could be right under our very noses.

134
00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:03.671
Or he could be living in
a log cabin somewhere.

135
00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:05.868
- My guess is that he's died.

136
00:07:05.868 --> 00:07:09.628
and you are milking the public
that thrive on conspiracies.

137
00:07:09.628 --> 00:07:11.708
- Well. now. you can think
what you wanna think.

138
00:07:11.708 --> 00:07:14.391
but only time can tell.

139
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:16.308
When "Cornered" hits the shelves.

140
00:07:16.308 --> 00:07:18.049
where can the public buy it?

141
00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:21.431
- So "Cornered" hits the shelves tomorrow.

142
00:07:21.431 --> 00:07:22.361
and the public can buy it

143
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:25.759
in any respectable bookshop and online.

144
00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.457
- D'you think Brian Corner
will be purchasing a copy?

145
00:07:28.457 --> 00:07:30.019
If he's still around. that is?

146
00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:33.675
- Well. you know. he may be
living in solitude somewhere.

147
00:07:33.675 --> 00:07:34.860
and never know that the book is there.

148
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.997
But if he does know. I think he'll buy it.

149
00:07:37.997 --> 00:07:41.158
I think he'll read it.
and I think he'll enjoy

150
00:07:41.158 --> 00:07:44.621
reading about the mystery that he set up.

151
00:08:37.374 --> 00:08:38.781
- I just don't like the thought of someone

152
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:41.798
capitalizing on someone else's debt.

153
00:08:41.798 --> 00:08:43.997
It don't sit right with me. all right?

154
00:08:43.997 --> 00:08:47.382
I mean. I know all the rumors.
All the conspiracy theories.

155
00:08:47.382 --> 00:08:49.782
"Oh. Brian Corner's still alive!"

156
00:08:49.782 --> 00:08:52.001
All that old bollocks.

157
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:53.251
It's not right.

158
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.100
He'd blow his bloody head off.

159
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.409
- Well. you'll always
get that sort of thing.

160
00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:05.530
It happened with Elvis.
Michael Jackson. Cobain.

161
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:09.792
You know. that fellow
that blew his brains out.

162
00:09:09.792 --> 00:09:11.253
There will always be conspiracies.

163
00:09:11.253 --> 00:09:14.880
- Don't make it right. though. does it?

164
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.213
- Don't worry about it then.

165
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:20.733
- So I want to send a
message to these people.

166
00:09:20.733 --> 00:09:22.162
Teach 'em not to spread lies.

167
00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:24.042
- How do you know it's a lie?

168
00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:25.173
Maybe it's the truth.

169
00:09:25.173 --> 00:09:26.600
- Oh. bollocks.

170
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.893
He's paid people to change
their stories. hasn't he?

171
00:09:29.893 --> 00:09:31.111
He's just a hack job.

172
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:34.392
Just to sell his book and
make some bloody money.

173
00:09:34.392 --> 00:09:37.493
- You can't blame people for making money.

174
00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:40.602
Are they hurting anyone by doing it?

175
00:09:40.602 --> 00:09:41.602
And besides.

176
00:09:43.431 --> 00:09:44.848
maybe it is true.

177
00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:49.600
- So you believe it then. do ya?

178
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.272
- I don't know Brian
Corner like you do. so.

179
00:09:52.272 --> 00:09:54.032
- Will you just listen to yourself?

180
00:09:54.032 --> 00:09:56.519
You're talking like he's still alive.

181
00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:58.930
He's dead. mate. all right. yeah?

182
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.427
He died 25 years ago.

183
00:10:01.427 --> 00:10:03.211
- That's what they say.

184
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:06.896
I'm not so sure after reading that book.

185
00:10:06.896 --> 00:10:09.811
- You're unfuckingbelievable.
you know that?

186
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:12.168
You actually believe it. don't you?

187
00:10:12.168 --> 00:10:14.749
- Listen. I don't know what I believe.

188
00:10:14.749 --> 00:10:17.448
It's just a story for me.

189
00:10:17.448 --> 00:10:19.804
I'm not invested in the
man like you are. so.

190
00:10:19.804 --> 00:10:21.522
I didn't know him like you did.

191
00:10:21.522 --> 00:10:23.506
So what do you want me to believe?

192
00:10:23.506 --> 00:10:27.164
I only read the book
because you gave it to me.

193
00:10:27.164 --> 00:10:30.831
- You people. You're
so gullible. aren't ya?

194
00:10:32.023 --> 00:10:33.440
- Listen. listen.

195
00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:40.799
Whether you like it or not.
people like good conspiracies.

196
00:10:41.276 --> 00:10:44.039
People believe Jesus
Christ died on the cross

197
00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:45.639
and he came back to life.

198
00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:47.383
Why is it so hard for you to believe

199
00:10:47.383 --> 00:10:49.783
that the man faked his own death?

200
00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:53.033
- I think you need to chill out. Check.

201
00:10:57.781 --> 00:10:59.602
- I'm a realist. mate.

202
00:10:59.602 --> 00:11:02.940
I don't buy into other people's bullshit.

203
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.580
- Yeah? So what are you
going to do about it?

204
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.903
- You'll see.

205
00:11:06.903 --> 00:11:08.738
And what is that?

206
00:11:08.738 --> 00:11:10.151
- I said

207
00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:11.068
you'll see.

208
00:11:15.733 --> 00:11:17.400
- He's a nutter. no?

209
00:11:18.882 --> 00:11:20.802
- He's going to kill someone.

210
00:11:20.802 --> 00:11:22.240
Maybe you should inform the police.

211
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.121
- No. he's harmless.

212
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:25.811
He always has a bee in his bonnet

213
00:11:25.811 --> 00:11:27.285
about one thing or another.

214
00:11:27.285 --> 00:11:28.325
We are
celebrating the music

215
00:11:28.325 --> 00:11:30.165
of Brian Corner today.

216
00:11:30.165 --> 00:11:31.602
We are taking requests and playing

217
00:11:31.602 --> 00:11:34.379
the Brian Corner songs
you want to hear the most.

218
00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:36.725
The hits and the obscure.

219
00:12:14.035 --> 00:12:15.035
- Brian! Hi.

220
00:12:17.496 --> 00:12:18.871
I am such a massive fan.

221
00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:21.592
I've seen you live three times.

222
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:24.028
Are you OK?

223
00:12:26.014 --> 00:12:27.311
It's like I'm in some sort of dream.

224
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:28.238
I was just coming over the bridge.

225
00:12:28.238 --> 00:12:32.238
and I saw you standing
here. and I was like. ah!

226
00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:36.760
Oh. will you signed something for me?

227
00:12:42.558 --> 00:12:44.641
Hold on. lemme get a pen.

228
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.110
Oh. my name is Chloe.

229
00:12:51.198 --> 00:12:54.281
You could just write something sweet.

230
00:13:07.617 --> 00:13:09.367
Oh my God. are you...

231
00:13:11.799 --> 00:13:14.264
Did you write me a song?

232
00:13:14.264 --> 00:13:17.154
Ah. I feel like I'm in some sort of dream.

233
00:13:17.154 --> 00:13:20.910
Oh. and thank you. Um. wait. hold on!

234
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.744
That was a little snippet

235
00:13:21.744 --> 00:13:23.457
of the devil of "Chloe's Song."

236
00:13:23.457 --> 00:13:25.275
discovered among Brian's belongings

237
00:13:25.275 --> 00:13:27.457
in the loft of his family home.

238
00:13:27.457 --> 00:13:31.084
"Chloe's Song" went number
nine in the charts in 1990.

239
00:13:48.377 --> 00:13:52.579
women. and he's inside

240
00:14:05.555 --> 00:14:09.519
and I used to flirt

241
00:14:15.706 --> 00:14:20.706
married in the morning

242
00:14:27.102 --> 00:14:31.522
up alone and hungover

243
00:14:31.522 --> 00:14:36.522
wearing for the groom

244
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.282
- I've been thinking.

245
00:14:55.282 --> 00:14:58.723
I've been thinking about
this Brian Corner fella.

246
00:14:58.723 --> 00:15:01.000
So I decided to read the book

247
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.621
that sent you on this wild goose chase.

248
00:15:02.621 --> 00:15:06.125
and looked at the pictures again.

249
00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:07.208
And. well. I.

250
00:15:09.632 --> 00:15:11.222
I think you're wasting your time.

251
00:15:11.222 --> 00:15:13.031
It's not the same guy.

252
00:15:13.031 --> 00:15:16.913
- Well. I know it is.
'cause I know that walk.

253
00:15:16.913 --> 00:15:17.746
- Well. I hope it is him.

254
00:15:17.746 --> 00:15:20.053
Otherwise this escapade is
gonna look a bit ridiculous

255
00:15:20.053 --> 00:15:22.314
when you find out it's not.

256
00:15:22.314 --> 00:15:24.816
- Well. it's worth taking
a chance. isn't it?

257
00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:27.961
I've never been able to sell
photos for this much before.

258
00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:29.642
- I think he's dead.

259
00:15:29.642 --> 00:15:31.786
And if he's not dead. then you
should just leave him alone.

260
00:15:31.786 --> 00:15:34.424
You're chasing a ghost.

261
00:15:34.424 --> 00:15:35.263
- Now. how can you say that?

262
00:15:35.263 --> 00:15:37.541
You're always complaining about money.

263
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:39.219
And a story like this comes along.

264
00:15:39.219 --> 00:15:41.139
I get a chance to do these photos.

265
00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:43.562
And you go and say something like that?

266
00:15:43.562 --> 00:15:45.599
- I'll believe it when I see it.

267
00:15:45.599 --> 00:15:46.602
- Are you gonna be so high and mighty

268
00:15:46.602 --> 00:15:49.285
when I prove to the
world he's still alive?

269
00:15:49.285 --> 00:15:51.697
- And how are you gonna
do that? A picture?

270
00:15:51.697 --> 00:15:55.598
- Yeah. Tells a thousand
stories. doesn't it?

271
00:15:55.598 --> 00:15:56.639
- You even said yourself

272
00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:59.178
that he doesn't look like the same guy.

273
00:15:59.178 --> 00:16:01.082
He's bigger and fatter.

274
00:16:01.082 --> 00:16:02.783
And he's probably even bald

275
00:16:02.783 --> 00:16:05.439
underneath the hat that he's wearing.

276
00:16:05.439 --> 00:16:08.057
Only a true fan would recognize him.

277
00:16:08.057 --> 00:16:10.196
- Yeah. and that's to my advantage.

278
00:16:10.196 --> 00:16:14.863
You know. most people don't
know these things. but I do.

279
00:16:17.295 --> 00:16:19.956
- Perhaps you simply want it to be him.

280
00:16:19.956 --> 00:16:22.292
You saw some guy in a park.

281
00:16:22.292 --> 00:16:24.150
and you believe that it's the same guy

282
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.811
from a book that alleges he's still alive.

283
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:29.209
A self-fulfilling prophecy.

284
00:16:29.209 --> 00:16:31.542
- I'm telling you. it's him.

285
00:16:57.041 --> 00:16:59.263
- That's Brian Corner. isn't it?

286
00:16:59.263 --> 00:17:01.513
That. that is Brian Corner!

287
00:17:04.037 --> 00:17:06.656
just leave it like that

288
00:17:07.489 --> 00:17:12.489
like that. leave it like that

289
00:17:13.455 --> 00:17:15.494
- Hey. Brian Corner!

290
00:17:15.494 --> 00:17:19.293
Hey. Brian Corner! Come here. come here!

291
00:17:19.293 --> 00:17:22.126
When is the next album coming out?

292
00:17:30.275 --> 00:17:31.525
- Brian. can...

293
00:17:35.075 --> 00:17:37.206
Could I have a look at. could I play your.

294
00:17:37.206 --> 00:17:38.907
could I have a look at your guitar?

295
00:17:38.907 --> 00:17:39.824
Is that OK?

296
00:17:48.969 --> 00:17:49.929
This is the guitar he played

297
00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:53.346
on the "Blank Statement" album. isn't it?

298
00:17:56.327 --> 00:17:58.077
Can I. can I play it?

299
00:18:10.049 --> 00:18:11.630
- Brian. you forgot your guitar!

300
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.550
- Can't believe it.

301
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.939
Brian Corner. he left his guitar for me.

302
00:18:15.939 --> 00:18:18.009
He didn't leave it
for you. It's his guitar.

303
00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:20.837
- The guy's got hundreds
anyway. He's loaded.

304
00:18:20.837 --> 00:18:23.378
- It's not your guitar. though.

305
00:18:23.378 --> 00:18:24.930
- That's not fair. you lanky twat.

306
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.538
- He did not leave the guitar for you.

307
00:18:27.538 --> 00:18:28.867
- I called dibs on it!

308
00:18:28.867 --> 00:18:29.856
- Yeah. but that doesn't mean-
- Plus. you guys

309
00:18:29.856 --> 00:18:31.970
don't even play guitar.

310
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.303
- Yeah. so what?

311
00:18:34.668 --> 00:18:37.837
We'll sell it and split it three ways.

312
00:18:37.837 --> 00:18:38.846
Does that make you happy?

313
00:18:38.846 --> 00:18:39.679
- No.

314
00:18:42.126 --> 00:18:43.097
You know. I was reading somewhere.

315
00:18:43.097 --> 00:18:44.756
He was on this really long tour.

316
00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:47.756
and apparently he did so many drugs.

317
00:18:52.806 --> 00:18:53.639
- Hello.

318
00:18:55.007 --> 00:18:56.228
Hello?

319
00:18:56.228 --> 00:18:58.351
- You're a dead man walking. mate.

320
00:18:58.351 --> 00:19:02.095
- Listen. you don't scare
me. whoever you are.

321
00:19:02.095 --> 00:19:03.606
- Your book's bullshit. mate.

322
00:19:03.606 --> 00:19:06.006
- Well. the sales are sky high.

323
00:19:06.006 --> 00:19:08.426
- Normally I like a good fairytale.

324
00:19:08.426 --> 00:19:11.142
- What have I written that
you think is not the truth?

325
00:19:11.142 --> 00:19:13.984
The whole thing is quite
dubious. don't you think?

326
00:19:13.984 --> 00:19:15.222
- No. No. I don't. actually.

327
00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:17.425
The only thing that I think is dubious

328
00:19:17.425 --> 00:19:21.121
is your piece of shit
book of lies and innuendo.

329
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:21.954
All right?

330
00:19:22.863 --> 00:19:25.276
- By the way. how'd you get this number?

331
00:19:25.276 --> 00:19:27.799
- Oh. I know everything about you. David.

332
00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:30.444
Where you live. what
you like for breakfast.

333
00:19:30.444 --> 00:19:33.206
your wife's routine. your kid's routine.

334
00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:36.027
- That's a bit extreme. don't you think?

335
00:19:36.027 --> 00:19:39.526
- Look. Brian Corner was a
friend of mine. All right?

336
00:19:39.526 --> 00:19:42.545
Now. he didn't ask for fame. Believe me.

337
00:19:42.545 --> 00:19:45.548
And people like you
are the reason he died.

338
00:19:45.548 --> 00:19:47.062
And if you think you're gonna get away

339
00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:48.486
with your little book of bullshit.

340
00:19:48.486 --> 00:19:51.498
well. you've got another thing coming.

341
00:19:51.498 --> 00:19:55.337
- Well. if he's dead. he's
dead. What do you care anyway?

342
00:19:55.337 --> 00:19:57.438
- D'you wanna know why he's
family and his true friends

343
00:19:57.438 --> 00:19:59.998
wouldn't talk to you
about your fucking book?

344
00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:02.874
That's because they had
respect for his memory.

345
00:20:02.874 --> 00:20:05.236
Pity you and your book
couldn't do the same. isn't it?

346
00:20:05.236 --> 00:20:07.876
- Hoo-hoo. I'd like to beg to differ.

347
00:20:07.876 --> 00:20:12.457
Didn't it ever occur to you
that they're protecting him?

348
00:20:12.457 --> 00:20:16.180
I think I made that argument
pretty strong. don't you think?

349
00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.654
- No. No. no. I don't think you
did. and that's the problem.

350
00:20:19.654 --> 00:20:23.140
Your book's bullshit. and you're
not gonna get away with it.

351
00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.557
Like I say. dead man walking.

352
00:21:07.377 --> 00:21:08.377
- Pizza guy.

353
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:23.334
- Pizza guy. eh?

354
00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:27.657
You scared me for a bit.

355
00:21:27.657 --> 00:21:28.647
- You scared me.

356
00:21:28.647 --> 00:21:31.364
I didn't order pizza.

357
00:21:31.364 --> 00:21:32.447
- You didn't?

358
00:21:40.004 --> 00:21:41.254
Play us a song.

359
00:21:43.043 --> 00:21:45.820
- I suppose I won't be
getting you to sing. will I?

360
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.743
I would love to hear you sing.

361
00:21:47.743 --> 00:21:49.161
- No. you don't.

362
00:21:49.161 --> 00:21:51.343
- Everyone can sing

363
00:21:51.343 --> 00:21:52.260
- Nonsense.

364
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.362
- I have some friends coming around

365
00:22:04.362 --> 00:22:06.740
on Friday for my birthday.

366
00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.980
Would you like to join us for some drinks?

367
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.940
And then we'll go for dinner.

368
00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.357
- Friday evening?

369
00:22:16.215 --> 00:22:19.314
I don't think I can make it.

370
00:22:19.314 --> 00:22:21.559
- I keep telling everyone
they need to meet you.

371
00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:25.454
They think you're a ghost.
A figment of my imagination.

372
00:22:25.454 --> 00:22:28.037
You must come. No more excuses.

373
00:22:30.919 --> 00:22:31.752
- Maybe.

374
00:22:33.912 --> 00:22:35.996
- You always say maybe.

375
00:22:35.996 --> 00:22:37.433
I've never. ever spent time with you

376
00:22:37.433 --> 00:22:39.295
in the presence of anyone else.

377
00:22:39.295 --> 00:22:40.873
- That's not true.

378
00:22:40.873 --> 00:22:42.553
I met your sister.

379
00:22:42.553 --> 00:22:44.668
- But you left two
minutes after she arrived.

380
00:22:44.668 --> 00:22:47.085
out of the door like a flash.

381
00:22:50.791 --> 00:22:55.335
Just because she asked you
a few personal questions.

382
00:22:55.335 --> 00:22:56.918
- I don't remember.

383
00:23:00.375 --> 00:23:01.633
I don't like crowds.

384
00:23:01.633 --> 00:23:04.466
- It's hardly going to be a crowd.

385
00:23:12.113 --> 00:23:12.946
- OK.

386
00:24:15.158 --> 00:24:17.716
- Excuse me. You know
where the station is?

387
00:24:17.716 --> 00:24:19.132
You know where the station is?
- Excuse me?

388
00:24:19.132 --> 00:24:20.371
- I said. do you know where the...

389
00:24:20.371 --> 00:24:21.954
- Ow! Fucking hell!

390
00:24:23.118 --> 00:24:26.035
- I said you're a dead man walking.

391
00:25:09.557 --> 00:25:12.140
- Ivan. Have a look at this.

392
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.418
- I'm sleeping.

393
00:25:13.418 --> 00:25:15.164
- You have to read this. No. wake up.

394
00:25:15.164 --> 00:25:16.220
- Leave me alone!

395
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.041
- No. wake up!

396
00:25:18.041 --> 00:25:19.458
- No.
- He did it.

397
00:25:20.479 --> 00:25:23.962
He killed the writer. It's
right here on the BBC.

398
00:25:23.962 --> 00:25:25.795
He stabbed him. Nigel.

399
00:25:26.833 --> 00:25:27.666
He did it.

400
00:25:29.696 --> 00:25:31.446
- Give me that thing.

401
00:25:34.175 --> 00:25:35.842
David worked for it.

402
00:25:42.855 --> 00:25:44.557
It doesn't say anything about Nigel.

403
00:25:44.557 --> 00:25:45.415
What are you talking about?

404
00:25:45.415 --> 00:25:48.994
- He said he was going
to do it. He did it.

405
00:25:48.994 --> 00:25:50.775
- It's just a coincidence.

406
00:25:50.775 --> 00:25:52.876
Also. this writer had a lot of enemies.

407
00:25:52.876 --> 00:25:55.858
- That seems a pretty big
coincidence. I would say.

408
00:25:55.858 --> 00:26:00.696
- Well. according to the police
report. it was a robbery.

409
00:26:00.696 --> 00:26:04.275
They stole his wallet. It was coincidence.

410
00:26:04.275 --> 00:26:06.435
- I reported him to the police.

411
00:26:06.435 --> 00:26:08.915
The blood is on our hands now.

412
00:26:08.915 --> 00:26:09.869
- It wasn't Nigel.

413
00:26:09.869 --> 00:26:11.369
- Who was it then?

414
00:26:12.263 --> 00:26:15.165
- How am I supposed to know? Let me sleep.

415
00:26:15.165 --> 00:26:18.665
- How can you sleep knowing what you know?

416
00:26:22.103 --> 00:26:23.708
I'm reporting it to the police.

417
00:26:23.708 --> 00:26:25.452
Oh. Go ahead.

418
00:26:25.452 --> 00:26:27.785
- And you're coming with me.

419
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.892
- When I turned round
the corner. he'd gone.

420
00:26:34.892 --> 00:26:38.172
- Maybe you imagined it all then.

421
00:26:38.172 --> 00:26:40.173
- Are you thinking I'm seeing ghosts now?

422
00:26:40.173 --> 00:26:42.387
The camera doesn't lie.

423
00:26:42.387 --> 00:26:44.893
- I'm sorry. but it's an obsession now.

424
00:26:44.893 --> 00:26:48.976
- What's wrong with
obsession? It pays the bills.

425
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:52.471
- Why don't you just go
up to him and ask him.

426
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:54.388
"Are you Brian Corner?"

427
00:26:55.314 --> 00:26:56.770
- That's a good idea.

428
00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.290
"Hello. Brian.

429
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.024
Excuse me. do you mind if
I just take your photo.

430
00:27:00.024 --> 00:27:01.826
and expose you to the world?"

431
00:27:01.826 --> 00:27:05.204
- So what you're gonna do then?

432
00:27:05.204 --> 00:27:08.647
- I don't know. 10 more photos. I suppose.

433
00:27:08.647 --> 00:27:11.389
- You better hurry up before
someone beats you to it.

434
00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:12.222
Why don't you try and take one

435
00:27:12.222 --> 00:27:13.906
of his face instead of his back

436
00:27:13.906 --> 00:27:16.989
so people can actually see who it is?

437
00:27:21.586 --> 00:27:22.419
- Lovely.

438
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:33.869
- Tonight. I'd like to
welcome to the show.

439
00:27:33.869 --> 00:27:36.887
renowned criminal profiler. Jerry Stark.

440
00:27:36.887 --> 00:27:39.330
to discuss the recent spate of murders

441
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.429
of journalists and media personalities.

442
00:27:42.429 --> 00:27:45.486
Obviously. this is an
issue close to my heart.

443
00:27:45.486 --> 00:27:47.620
and to be pretty frank. quite frightening.

444
00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.758
But we'll will not run
away from this issue.

445
00:27:49.758 --> 00:27:53.534
We will face this issue
head-on. as we've always done.

446
00:27:53.534 --> 00:27:55.955
So Mr. Jerry Stark. what
does your experience tell you

447
00:27:55.955 --> 00:28:00.275
about these murders of journalists
and media personalities?

448
00:28:00.275 --> 00:28:03.016
- I don't believe it was a lone murderer.

449
00:28:03.016 --> 00:28:05.452
They're copycat killings.

450
00:28:05.452 --> 00:28:09.214
- But do you think it all
started with the release

451
00:28:09.214 --> 00:28:13.828
and publication of David
Watford's book on Brian Corner?

452
00:28:13.828 --> 00:28:17.831
- There has to be a catalyst
and that could be the catalyst.

453
00:28:17.831 --> 00:28:19.704
But there were other suspicious deaths

454
00:28:19.704 --> 00:28:22.411
in the years previous that could indicate

455
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:25.950
that the murders were
already set in motion.

456
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:29.793
They just picked up steam
with Watford's book.

457
00:28:29.793 --> 00:28:31.435
- It's pretty frightening times.

458
00:28:31.435 --> 00:28:33.131
I've had to hire a bodyguard.

459
00:28:33.131 --> 00:28:35.515
and I don't go out the same way I used to.

460
00:28:35.515 --> 00:28:37.313
- It's not a lone killer.

461
00:28:37.313 --> 00:28:39.851
So long as you keep
yourself pretty visible.

462
00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:41.894
you should be OK.

463
00:28:41.894 --> 00:28:43.449
Don't walk down any dark alleys.

464
00:28:43.449 --> 00:28:47.494
- But if it's multiple killers.
copycats. as you think.

465
00:28:47.494 --> 00:28:50.193
then surely one of them is
gonna wanna take the limelight

466
00:28:50.193 --> 00:28:53.537
and take a risk of getting
caught. even in broad daylight.

467
00:28:53.537 --> 00:28:55.937
I'm not sure that I wanna be a victim.

468
00:28:55.937 --> 00:28:58.743
- Well. you should be careful. obviously.

469
00:28:58.743 --> 00:29:01.863
The problem is. the more
you cover for the story.

470
00:29:01.863 --> 00:29:04.274
the more interest to propel a copycat

471
00:29:04.274 --> 00:29:06.798
to become part of the story.

472
00:29:06.798 --> 00:29:08.376
- Well. I'm just trying to make a living.

473
00:29:08.376 --> 00:29:11.436
I ask questions. I have
no political agenda.

474
00:29:11.436 --> 00:29:13.198
- Are you sure about that?

475
00:29:13.198 --> 00:29:16.638
- Look. I have people from
all political affiliations.

476
00:29:16.638 --> 00:29:17.836
all walks of life on the show.

477
00:29:17.836 --> 00:29:22.003
I'm open minded. How the
hell has it come to this?

478
00:29:22.936 --> 00:29:25.814
- We live in crazy times.

479
00:29:25.814 --> 00:29:28.915
But let's not forget. the 1970s and 1980s

480
00:29:28.915 --> 00:29:32.498
were much more fruitful
for serial killers.

481
00:29:33.656 --> 00:29:37.239
DNA profiling. better
policing. cellphones.

482
00:29:39.313 --> 00:29:42.171
all of these things have
made it much more difficult

483
00:29:42.171 --> 00:29:44.504
for serial killers to exist.

484
00:29:46.009 --> 00:29:49.009
These people are smart. intelligent.

485
00:29:52.155 --> 00:29:54.572
They have adapted their game.

486
00:29:55.611 --> 00:29:57.944
As I said. they're copycats.

487
00:30:03.874 --> 00:30:06.541
- You're a fucking idiot. Stark.

488
00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:11.371
Copycats!

489
00:30:11.371 --> 00:30:12.871
Copycats. my arse.

490
00:30:19.792 --> 00:30:20.625
Ow! Ah!

491
00:30:42.411 --> 00:30:43.411
- Who is it?

492
00:30:45.814 --> 00:30:46.647
Pizza guy?

493
00:30:48.388 --> 00:30:49.805
He's not allowed.

494
00:31:02.731 --> 00:31:04.331
I knew you wouldn't come.

495
00:31:04.331 --> 00:31:05.835
- Sorry. I was busy.

496
00:31:05.835 --> 00:31:06.668
- Liar.

497
00:31:09.123 --> 00:31:10.835
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

498
00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:15.550
- I don't think I should
after you stood me up again.

499
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.383
- Sorry.

500
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:36.860
you're rolling in clover

501
00:31:44.879 --> 00:31:46.442
- I just had friends over for lunch.

502
00:31:46.442 --> 00:31:48.616
Shame you missed them all again.

503
00:31:48.616 --> 00:31:51.783
Your timing is always impeccably poor.

504
00:31:58.202 --> 00:32:02.035
- Pure coincidence. my
dear. Pure coincidence.

505
00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:04.054
- So.

506
00:32:05.385 --> 00:32:07.635
What do I owe the pleasure?

507
00:32:08.872 --> 00:32:11.388
- Well. I wanted to tell you

508
00:32:11.388 --> 00:32:15.388
that I'm gonna be going
away for a little while.

509
00:32:16.733 --> 00:32:19.733
I didn't want you to worry about me.

510
00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:23.406
- Who is she?

511
00:32:23.406 --> 00:32:25.533
- Does it matter?

512
00:32:25.533 --> 00:32:26.866
- I suppose not.

513
00:32:30.105 --> 00:32:31.605
- She's my sister.

514
00:32:32.584 --> 00:32:34.528
- Your sister?

515
00:32:34.528 --> 00:32:35.528
- My sister.

516
00:32:36.584 --> 00:32:37.613
We are
celebrating the music

517
00:32:37.613 --> 00:32:39.469
of Brian Corner today.

518
00:32:39.469 --> 00:32:42.312
We are taking requests and
playing the Brian Corner songs

519
00:32:42.312 --> 00:32:45.875
you want to hear the most.
from the hits to the obscure.

520
00:33:08.444 --> 00:33:13.444
a kid all over again

521
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:24.740
from a book I read

522
00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:30.882
your seed in my head

523
00:33:30.882 --> 00:33:35.882
met somewhere before

524
00:34:01.157 --> 00:34:06.058
a kid all over again

525
00:34:11.072 --> 00:34:16.072
a kid all over again

526
00:34:26.685 --> 00:34:28.222
The late. great Chloe Gates

527
00:34:28.222 --> 00:34:30.624
sang on half a dozen songs with the band.

528
00:34:30.624 --> 00:34:33.684
She sang with Brian on this
one. my personal favorite.

529
00:34:41.328 --> 00:34:46.328
you were lying next to me

530
00:37:11.693 --> 00:37:16.693
you were lying next to me

531
00:39:25.355 --> 00:39:26.188
- Oh. Boo!

532
00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:46.075
- Good afternoon.

533
00:39:46.075 --> 00:39:46.908
- Hey.

534
00:39:48.315 --> 00:39:49.275
How are you doing?

535
00:39:49.275 --> 00:39:51.115
- Good. thanks. What can I get you?

536
00:39:51.115 --> 00:39:54.013
- Ah. just a Coke. please.

537
00:39:54.013 --> 00:39:56.694
Any hotels around here? B&Bs or anything?

538
00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:59.531
- We have rooms upstairs.

539
00:39:59.531 --> 00:40:00.891
- Take card as well?

540
00:40:00.891 --> 00:40:01.891
- Of course.

541
00:40:06.669 --> 00:40:10.369
- Going for a walk in this
town. and well. it's lovely.

542
00:40:10.369 --> 00:40:12.068
Some nice houses.

543
00:40:12.068 --> 00:40:14.228
A massive house down a private road.

544
00:40:14.228 --> 00:40:15.889
Who lives there?

545
00:40:15.889 --> 00:40:17.830
- Why do you want to know?

546
00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:19.846
- Just curious.

547
00:40:19.846 --> 00:40:21.529
- Not really for me to say.

548
00:40:21.529 --> 00:40:23.329
- Oh. No worries.

549
00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:25.785
I'm just a curious person. I guess.

550
00:40:25.785 --> 00:40:27.487
What's your name?

551
00:40:27.487 --> 00:40:28.884
- Penelope.

552
00:40:28.884 --> 00:40:29.717
- Peter.

553
00:40:30.563 --> 00:40:31.764
- Nice to meet you. Peter.

554
00:40:31.764 --> 00:40:33.764
- Nice to meet you. too.

555
00:40:44.068 --> 00:40:46.484
So what's there to do around here?

556
00:40:46.484 --> 00:40:49.488
- Well. there is always the park.

557
00:40:49.488 --> 00:40:50.525
- Park?

558
00:40:50.525 --> 00:40:52.694
- Yeah. the park.

559
00:40:52.694 --> 00:40:54.825
You look like you could
use a bit of nature.

560
00:40:54.825 --> 00:40:55.696
- Is that right?

561
00:40:57.296 --> 00:40:58.256
- What are you doing tomorrow?

562
00:40:58.256 --> 00:40:59.673
- Don't know yet.

563
00:41:00.776 --> 00:41:02.077
- What about this park?

564
00:41:02.077 --> 00:41:03.410
- What about it?

565
00:41:21.017 --> 00:41:22.691
- Hey.
- Hey.

566
00:42:09.462 --> 00:42:12.295
- You can answer that if you want.

567
00:42:16.747 --> 00:42:18.851
Someone special?

568
00:42:18.851 --> 00:42:20.112
- Business.

569
00:42:20.112 --> 00:42:23.269
- What exactly is your business?

570
00:42:23.269 --> 00:42:25.385
- Um. long story.

571
00:42:25.385 --> 00:42:26.661
I can tell you in the park tomorrow.

572
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:27.494
- Ah!

573
00:42:27.494 --> 00:42:29.003
- You can help me with something.

574
00:42:29.003 --> 00:42:31.883
- Yeah. well. maybe. maybe not.

575
00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:33.830
- What have you got to lose?

576
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:35.484
- Everything.

577
00:43:26.535 --> 00:43:27.618
- "Cornered."

578
00:43:59.852 --> 00:44:01.852
Thank you.

579
00:44:09.954 --> 00:44:11.372
- It's beautiful.

580
00:44:11.372 --> 00:44:12.955
- Yeah. I think so.

581
00:44:15.815 --> 00:44:19.932
So you were gonna tell me
what you do for a living.

582
00:44:19.932 --> 00:44:20.765
- Ha. OK.

583
00:44:21.608 --> 00:44:22.594
But you can't laugh.

584
00:44:22.594 --> 00:44:25.096
- All right. Promise.

585
00:44:25.096 --> 00:44:27.832
- All right. and that as well.

586
00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:28.749
Right then.

587
00:44:30.076 --> 00:44:32.978
Ah. well. I'm a photographer.

588
00:44:32.978 --> 00:44:33.978
- Hilarious?

589
00:44:34.837 --> 00:44:37.122
- OK. well. not a
photographer. A paparazzi.

590
00:44:37.122 --> 00:44:40.479
- Oh. God. paparazzi. What a shame.

591
00:44:40.479 --> 00:44:41.312
- I haven't been doing it long.

592
00:44:41.312 --> 00:44:43.835
It's just. it pays the bills. all right?

593
00:44:43.835 --> 00:44:44.998
- Is that what you're doing here?

594
00:44:44.998 --> 00:44:48.295
Did you follow someone
to take their photo?

595
00:44:48.295 --> 00:44:51.112
- It's more of a personal
project. Detective work.

596
00:44:51.112 --> 00:44:55.695
- Detective work? Gosh. you
make it sound so glamorous.

597
00:44:58.892 --> 00:45:00.184
- I'm not sure I'm doing a very good job.

598
00:45:00.184 --> 00:45:02.561
But you might be able to help.

599
00:45:02.561 --> 00:45:03.394
- How?

600
00:45:04.819 --> 00:45:07.083
- The person I'm looking for lives nearby.

601
00:45:07.083 --> 00:45:10.631
- Hmm-mm. There isn't
anyone famous around here.

602
00:45:10.631 --> 00:45:11.996
- I believe there is.

603
00:45:11.996 --> 00:45:12.829
- Who?

604
00:45:14.039 --> 00:45:16.177
- It's a guy called Brian Corner.

605
00:45:16.177 --> 00:45:20.316
A musician who disappeared
around 30 years ago. in the '80s.

606
00:45:20.316 --> 00:45:24.416
Supposedly died. but I
don't believe he did.

607
00:45:24.416 --> 00:45:26.117
- I don't know him.

608
00:45:26.117 --> 00:45:28.199
- Well. I can show you some
photos. You can take a look.

609
00:45:28.199 --> 00:45:31.036
You see. he may have been in the pub.

610
00:45:31.036 --> 00:45:33.053
- All right. but why not
just leave him alone?

611
00:45:33.053 --> 00:45:37.600
I mean. if he wants to be
dead. then let him be dead.

612
00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.242
- But it's my job. you know.

613
00:45:39.242 --> 00:45:41.575
- It's not really an excuse.

614
00:45:44.662 --> 00:45:46.329
- Brilliant. I mean.

615
00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:51.391
I suppose I do need to
focus on looking for him.

616
00:45:51.391 --> 00:45:52.860
- Sorry to have been a distraction.

617
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.044
- No. it's not your fault.

618
00:45:54.044 --> 00:45:55.307
- You didn't have to come
here today. you know.

619
00:45:55.307 --> 00:45:57.291
- No. I wanted to come here.

620
00:45:57.291 --> 00:46:00.513
I really wanted to come here
with you. to be with you.

621
00:46:00.513 --> 00:46:02.134
I wanted to.

622
00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:04.784
But I do need to keep
looking for him as well.

623
00:46:04.784 --> 00:46:07.344
- Focus on that if
that's what you wanna do.

624
00:46:07.344 --> 00:46:09.339
- OK. but look. I'm gonna
show you the photos.

625
00:46:09.339 --> 00:46:11.412
At least have a look.

626
00:46:11.412 --> 00:46:14.252
And you may recognize him.

627
00:46:14.252 --> 00:46:15.085
OK?
- Sure.

628
00:46:16.601 --> 00:46:17.518
- Let's go.

629
00:46:23.033 --> 00:46:24.533
- Wake up!

630
00:46:24.533 --> 00:46:28.200
Look who's here!

631
00:46:32.817 --> 00:46:35.974
So to what do I owe your presence?

632
00:46:35.974 --> 00:46:40.316
- No reason. Just felt
like coming for a visit.

633
00:46:40.316 --> 00:46:41.414
- Just like that?

634
00:46:41.414 --> 00:46:42.831
- Just like that.

635
00:47:24.396 --> 00:47:28.540
is anyone's guess

636
00:48:27.249 --> 00:48:30.428
- I've been tinkering with
some of the old songs.

637
00:48:30.428 --> 00:48:31.511
- Oh. really?

638
00:48:33.029 --> 00:48:33.862
- Yup.

639
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:37.548
- I'd like to have a listen.

640
00:48:37.548 --> 00:48:41.215
- Well. it could do
with some of your magic.

641
00:48:43.489 --> 00:48:45.739
- Well. I'll have a listen.

642
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.140
- Not doing a very good job. am I?

643
00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:57.973
- What are you talking about?

644
00:48:57.973 --> 00:48:59.679
I think you're a wonderful photographer.

645
00:48:59.679 --> 00:49:00.801
- You think so?

646
00:49:00.801 --> 00:49:03.664
- Yeah. Look. take my photograph.

647
00:49:03.664 --> 00:49:04.497
Just my eyes.

648
00:49:04.497 --> 00:49:05.584
- Mm-hmm.

649
00:49:09.699 --> 00:49:10.859
- Did you get just my eyes?

650
00:49:10.859 --> 00:49:11.867
- Yeah. Have a look.

651
00:49:11.867 --> 00:49:12.867
- Let's see.

652
00:49:13.727 --> 00:49:15.148
- Hey!

653
00:49:15.148 --> 00:49:16.468
Come back here with that.

654
00:49:16.468 --> 00:49:17.669
It's worth a lot of money.

655
00:49:17.669 --> 00:49:19.509
Who needs money?

656
00:49:19.509 --> 00:49:20.426
- Everyone.

657
00:49:23.413 --> 00:49:26.496
Come out. come out. wherever you are!

658
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:30.773
Come out. come out. wherever you are!

659
00:49:38.729 --> 00:49:39.562
There's the thief.

660
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.983
- Delete all your pictures?

661
00:49:41.983 --> 00:49:43.241
- Ah. yeah. you wouldn't dare.

662
00:49:43.241 --> 00:49:44.518
- Oh. wouldn't I?

663
00:49:44.518 --> 00:49:46.575
No. Oh!

664
00:49:46.575 --> 00:49:47.422
- Serves you right.

665
00:49:47.422 --> 00:49:50.286
Karma for taking pictures of
poor. unsuspecting people.

666
00:49:50.286 --> 00:49:51.119
Is that right?

667
00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:52.564
- Yeah. yeah. there we go.

668
00:49:52.564 --> 00:49:54.609
Loving it. loving it. loving it.

669
00:49:54.609 --> 00:49:56.104
- Come now. OK. your turn now.

670
00:49:56.104 --> 00:49:57.712
Come on. give it back.
- Oh God. Really?

671
00:49:57.712 --> 00:49:58.901
- Over to the professional.

672
00:49:58.901 --> 00:50:00.533
Oh. look at that.

673
00:50:00.533 --> 00:50:02.912
Done this before. haven't you. eh?

674
00:50:02.912 --> 00:50:04.032
Don't stick your tongue out at me.

675
00:50:04.032 --> 00:50:05.931
Put that away. Put that away.

676
00:50:05.931 --> 00:50:07.504
Give us a nice little smile. yeah?

677
00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.337
- Fine.
- Look at that.

678
00:50:10.271 --> 00:50:13.257
Picture perfect. Go on then. come on.

679
00:50:13.257 --> 00:50:15.198
- All right. I fancy a pint.

680
00:50:15.198 --> 00:50:16.195
You fancy a pint. eh?

681
00:50:16.195 --> 00:50:18.078
- Enough nature for one day.

682
00:50:18.078 --> 00:50:19.404
Come on.

683
00:50:19.404 --> 00:50:24.404
you are the worst one

684
00:51:21.728 --> 00:51:23.498
- Here for the sun?

685
00:51:23.498 --> 00:51:25.248
- Ah. it's beautiful.

686
00:51:29.351 --> 00:51:31.809
- What do you think about these murders?

687
00:51:31.809 --> 00:51:34.272
I never liked that whatsit fellow myself.

688
00:51:34.272 --> 00:51:36.689
but he didn't deserve to die.

689
00:51:38.118 --> 00:51:39.701
Nor did the others.

690
00:51:42.047 --> 00:51:46.022
Anyway. they'll catch him
eventually. whoever it is.

691
00:51:46.022 --> 00:51:48.561
- Could it not be a she?

692
00:51:48.561 --> 00:51:50.758
- Could be a network.

693
00:51:50.758 --> 00:51:51.591
- Nah.

694
00:51:52.758 --> 00:51:53.761
Conspiracies don't work

695
00:51:53.761 --> 00:51:57.344
when there's more than
two people involved.

696
00:51:58.276 --> 00:52:00.359
- Don't worry about them.

697
00:52:02.594 --> 00:52:04.376
How are your mother and father?

698
00:52:04.376 --> 00:52:05.959
- Ah. they're fine.

699
00:52:07.635 --> 00:52:12.635
- They must wanna see you.

700
00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:15.190
- I talk to them on the phone.

701
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.883
- You should go visit.

702
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.233
- Yeah.

703
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:23.317
That'd be nice.

704
00:52:25.664 --> 00:52:28.583
- Why don't you answer
that? Don't mind me.

705
00:52:36.527 --> 00:52:37.360
- Hello?

706
00:52:38.263 --> 00:52:40.322
Hi. sweetheart.

707
00:52:40.322 --> 00:52:42.298
- Where are you?

708
00:52:42.298 --> 00:52:46.221
Um. not sure. Couple
of hours outside of London.

709
00:52:46.221 --> 00:52:50.119
I thought he was going
to this shop. but...

710
00:52:50.119 --> 00:52:52.418
- When are you back. Peter?

711
00:52:52.418 --> 00:52:54.919
I don't know. I just got here.

712
00:52:54.919 --> 00:52:57.602
- So you're just gonna
keep following him around?

713
00:52:57.602 --> 00:53:01.615
Well. yeah. that's
the plan. Follow him around.

714
00:53:01.615 --> 00:53:04.148
- Has he noticed that
you're following him?

715
00:53:04.148 --> 00:53:07.231
No. no. I'm a professional.

716
00:53:07.231 --> 00:53:11.172
- So how long are you gonna
keep following him around for?

717
00:53:11.172 --> 00:53:12.906
Why. I need more proof.

718
00:53:12.906 --> 00:53:16.139
A picture that's clearer. to
be matched with an older one.

719
00:53:16.139 --> 00:53:19.181
The more photos I take. the better.

720
00:53:19.181 --> 00:53:21.103
- Why don't you take
a picture of his ears?

721
00:53:21.103 --> 00:53:22.599
It's the best way to identify him.

722
00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:27.598
I watched a documentary
on it. The ears don't lie.

723
00:53:27.598 --> 00:53:28.980
Oh. dammit. he's just walked by!

724
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:30.647
I'll call you later.

725
00:53:48.938 --> 00:53:50.855
- That new credit card.

726
00:53:52.295 --> 00:53:53.941
Did you get it?
- Yeah. I got it. I got it.

727
00:53:53.941 --> 00:53:55.071
Thank you.

728
00:53:55.071 --> 00:53:57.962
- Good. Speaking of cards.

729
00:53:57.962 --> 00:54:02.258
Do you ever wish you'd play
your cards differently?

730
00:54:02.258 --> 00:54:03.330
- Not anymore.

731
00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:06.193
But you did at one time?

732
00:54:06.193 --> 00:54:09.136
- When I was younger. of course. Sure.

733
00:54:09.136 --> 00:54:11.360
- What do you mean?

734
00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.600
- You know what I mean.

735
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.499
- I suppose I do.

736
00:54:15.499 --> 00:54:17.378
You know. I always used to love to play

737
00:54:17.378 --> 00:54:20.022
capture the flag when I was a kid.

738
00:54:20.022 --> 00:54:22.189
I was very good. you know.

739
00:54:23.382 --> 00:54:25.099
I knew all the best spots.

740
00:54:25.099 --> 00:54:28.995
The shady places where you
could hide in the shade.

741
00:54:28.995 --> 00:54:33.162
in the shadows. so you
could sneak up on somebody.

742
00:54:35.336 --> 00:54:37.393
And the guy who was guarding
the opponent's flag.

743
00:54:37.393 --> 00:54:39.060
he always got itchy.

744
00:54:40.815 --> 00:54:43.871
And eventually. he would leave his post

745
00:54:43.871 --> 00:54:47.356
to find out what was
happening nearer our flag.

746
00:54:47.356 --> 00:54:51.773
And I would run in. grab
that flag. and away with me.

747
00:54:54.714 --> 00:54:58.796
- Capture the flag is make believe. Jack.

748
00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:01.046
Real war. life is at stake.

749
00:55:02.156 --> 00:55:06.770
- Couldn't you just let me
have my moment of glory?

750
00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:09.603
- Sorry. it's a good story. Go on.

751
00:55:12.033 --> 00:55:15.253
- Tell you what. Let's
continue over dinner.

752
00:55:15.253 --> 00:55:16.956
- All right.

753
00:55:16.956 --> 00:55:18.456
What's for dinner?

754
00:55:19.895 --> 00:55:21.116
Fish pie.

755
00:55:21.116 --> 00:55:22.033
- Fish pie?

756
00:55:22.913 --> 00:55:25.163
Kittycat get some fish pie?

757
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:32.843
- Yeah.

758
00:55:54.945 --> 00:55:59.945
is I'll be all right

759
00:56:24.690 --> 00:56:28.194
some pretty tough times

760
00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:01.054
- Hey. Why don't you pick up your phone?

761
00:57:01.054 --> 00:57:04.051
I've been trying to call you for days.

762
00:57:04.051 --> 00:57:06.468
Are you all right? I hope so.

763
00:57:07.651 --> 00:57:09.630
Listen. I'm not calling to invite you

764
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:11.033
to any more of my parties.

765
00:57:11.033 --> 00:57:14.590
You don't have to think up any
more lame excuses. all right?

766
00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:16.851
I just wanted to say hi. That's all.

767
00:57:16.851 --> 00:57:20.313
I have no questions
whatsoever to ask you. Nada.

768
00:57:20.313 --> 00:57:22.909
So you can put yourself at ease.

769
00:57:22.909 --> 00:57:26.574
And call me back once
you get it. all right?

770
00:57:26.574 --> 00:57:30.574
It would be nice to hear
your voice anyway. Bye.

771
00:57:35.374 --> 00:57:36.730
- You know. I think that
was the best fish pie

772
00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:38.807
since the last time I had your fish pie.

773
00:57:38.807 --> 00:57:41.474
- Well. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

774
00:57:49.149 --> 00:57:50.923
Well. it's good to know

775
00:57:50.923 --> 00:57:54.587
I'll have such adulation after I'm dead.

776
00:57:54.587 --> 00:57:56.507
Better late than never. I suppose.

777
00:57:56.507 --> 00:57:58.310
- Truer words were never spoken.

778
00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:00.006
- Easy for you to say.

779
00:58:00.006 --> 00:58:01.947
- You will reap your rewards in heaven.

780
00:58:01.947 --> 00:58:04.030
- So you keep telling me.

781
00:58:06.067 --> 00:58:10.230
By the way. your old band
mate has a new album out.

782
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:12.081
- Yeah. I know.

783
00:58:12.081 --> 00:58:13.348
What did you think?

784
00:58:13.348 --> 00:58:14.641
- It's good.

785
00:58:14.641 --> 00:58:16.141
- It's diabolical!

786
00:58:19.067 --> 00:58:19.900
- Harsh.

787
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:23.463
- Thanks.

788
00:58:27.867 --> 00:58:28.700
Aw.

789
00:58:29.613 --> 00:58:31.516
I barely slept.

790
00:58:31.516 --> 00:58:32.918
- Why not?

791
00:58:32.918 --> 00:58:35.617
- It's just that I'm taking photos.

792
00:58:35.617 --> 00:58:37.117
- What did you do?

793
00:58:38.054 --> 00:58:39.894
- I'm just taking some great shots.

794
00:58:39.894 --> 00:58:40.849
- You didn't.

795
00:58:40.849 --> 00:58:41.682
- Yeah.

796
00:58:43.094 --> 00:58:45.097
But he was with this. some other man.

797
00:58:45.097 --> 00:58:48.257
I don't know. his father or
uncle or something like that.

798
00:58:48.257 --> 00:58:50.590
- Here. look. I'll show you.

799
00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.081
You recognize him now?

800
00:58:56.081 --> 00:59:00.415
- No. No. I've told you.
I've never seen him before.

801
00:59:00.415 --> 00:59:03.832
- Well. what about that guy
he's having dinner with?

802
00:59:03.832 --> 00:59:06.332
- Nope. Never seen him either.

803
00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:13.438
Look. what are you even
gonna do with these pictures?

804
00:59:13.438 --> 00:59:14.718
- Sell 'em.

805
00:59:14.718 --> 00:59:15.551
- To who?

806
00:59:17.278 --> 00:59:20.360
- I know people who'll
buy them. all right?

807
00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.604
That's it. My work here is done.

808
00:59:23.604 --> 00:59:25.519
It's time to party.
We've got to celebrate.

809
00:59:25.519 --> 00:59:27.679
Time to go somewhere.
do something. Anywhere.

810
00:59:27.679 --> 00:59:29.199
- Anywhere?
- Anywhere.

811
00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:30.290
OK then.

812
00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:31.695
- Come on. lead the way.

813
00:59:31.695 --> 00:59:32.528
- All right. fine.

814
00:59:32.528 --> 00:59:34.489
- Great. I must make a call.

815
00:59:34.489 --> 00:59:37.072
I'll be back in a minute. Yeah.

816
00:59:43.857 --> 00:59:46.107
They. they're good. Mm-hmm.

817
00:59:47.174 --> 00:59:51.007
About 10 or 15. That'll
be enough to cover it.

818
00:59:53.396 --> 00:59:54.229
Yeah.

819
00:59:56.176 --> 00:59:58.593
Could be worth a lot. I think

820
01:00:00.268 --> 01:00:01.564
- Look. there's no word. I do not.

821
01:00:01.564 --> 01:00:02.604
- Yeah. she's good.
- She's canceled.

822
01:00:02.604 --> 01:00:04.214
- She's canceled.

823
01:00:04.214 --> 01:00:05.698
- You never feed the padded pasta.

824
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:11.069
That was such a good point.

825
01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:23.957
- How are you?

826
01:00:28.129 --> 01:00:30.212
When are you coming back?

827
01:00:34.858 --> 01:00:38.358
I've been thinking about you a lot lately.

828
01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.107
In a good way.

829
01:00:42.273 --> 01:00:44.023
In an unexpected way.

830
01:00:47.839 --> 01:00:49.422
You left your book.

831
01:00:53.076 --> 01:00:55.476
I've been reading it. actually.

832
01:00:55.476 --> 01:00:56.309
I like it.

833
01:00:57.394 --> 01:00:58.727
Very mysterious.

834
01:01:03.039 --> 01:01:04.206
I believed it.

835
01:01:05.755 --> 01:01:08.088
So when are you coming back?

836
01:01:11.179 --> 01:01:12.012
Jack?

837
01:01:13.642 --> 01:01:14.642
Jack. hello?

838
01:01:25.575 --> 01:01:27.739
- Been an amazing few days with you.

839
01:01:27.739 --> 01:01:29.576
I could get used to
this whole nature thing.

840
01:01:29.576 --> 01:01:30.659
- Well. good.

841
01:01:33.821 --> 01:01:37.939
- I came here to find Brian
Corner. and I found you.

842
01:01:37.939 --> 01:01:39.261
That's what I call a bonus.

843
01:01:39.261 --> 01:01:44.077
- Well. what's better? Meeting
me or taking his photograph?

844
01:01:44.077 --> 01:01:45.496
- Oh. that's a tricky one.

845
01:01:45.496 --> 01:01:47.661
- God. you're horrible!

846
01:01:47.661 --> 01:01:49.078
- You. obviously.

847
01:01:50.316 --> 01:01:51.149
Obviously.

848
01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.736
God. you know. I really.
really don't wanna leave.

849
01:01:59.736 --> 01:02:02.157
But I need to get these
photos back to London.

850
01:02:02.157 --> 01:02:04.375
- Leave them. They're not important.

851
01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:07.125
- You don't know how big this is.

852
01:02:11.283 --> 01:02:13.950
What's the matter? What's wrong.

853
01:02:18.563 --> 01:02:19.396
- Peter.

854
01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:25.604
Look. I don't think it's
right. what you're doing?

855
01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.023
- What do you mean?

856
01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.247
- This guy. He doesn't wanna be alive.

857
01:02:33.677 --> 01:02:37.813
He doesn't wanna be known.
He just wants a quiet life.

858
01:02:37.813 --> 01:02:41.416
And your photos are an
intrusion into his privacy.

859
01:02:41.416 --> 01:02:42.249
I think...

860
01:02:44.317 --> 01:02:47.779
I think you should throw them away.

861
01:02:47.779 --> 01:02:49.029
- Destroy them?

862
01:02:50.965 --> 01:02:52.141
It's too late.

863
01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:53.821
The agent's got the ball
rolling on it. I can't.

864
01:02:53.821 --> 01:02:56.083
- Oh. come on. Peter.
You're a great photographer.

865
01:02:56.083 --> 01:02:58.723
You don't need this
sleaze. It's beneath you.

866
01:02:58.723 --> 01:03:00.223
- How do you know?

867
01:03:02.685 --> 01:03:03.518
- Well.

868
01:03:04.542 --> 01:03:07.043
I know that I can't let myself fall

869
01:03:07.043 --> 01:03:09.758
for someone I can't respect.

870
01:03:09.758 --> 01:03:14.008
If you sell those photos.
then I won't respect you.

871
01:03:17.081 --> 01:03:18.664
- Is that a threat?

872
01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:20.794
- No.

873
01:03:22.715 --> 01:03:24.715
No. it's just the truth.

874
01:04:24.567 --> 01:04:25.900
- There you are.

875
01:04:28.594 --> 01:04:30.333
- I missed this place.

876
01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:31.166
- Oh.

877
01:04:32.651 --> 01:04:34.397
Stay as long as you like.

878
01:04:34.397 --> 01:04:35.954
It's your place. after all.

879
01:04:35.954 --> 01:04:37.037
- It's yours.

880
01:04:37.895 --> 01:04:41.473
- Your gift to me for playing my part

881
01:04:41.473 --> 01:04:44.306
so adequately for all these years.

882
01:04:45.677 --> 01:04:49.415
To be fair. it's a very easy role to play.

883
01:04:49.415 --> 01:04:51.394
- Those are the best ones.

884
01:04:51.394 --> 01:04:54.311
- I'd rather have played your role.

885
01:04:55.575 --> 01:04:56.575
- Which one?

886
01:04:57.954 --> 01:04:58.871
- You know.

887
01:05:01.037 --> 01:05:02.855
- Well. if you wish.

888
01:05:02.855 --> 01:05:06.438
- I'm too old for that
now. And so are you.

889
01:05:08.135 --> 01:05:11.500
But we might not have any choice after all

890
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.257
with these recent developments.

891
01:05:14.257 --> 01:05:17.507
You're suddenly becoming popular again.

892
01:05:19.105 --> 01:05:23.188
I suppose that's the reason
you've come to visit.

893
01:05:27.921 --> 01:05:29.004
- You got me.

894
01:05:30.583 --> 01:05:31.916
- There you are.

895
01:05:34.237 --> 01:05:35.402
This is
one of those obscure

896
01:05:35.402 --> 01:05:37.845
Brian Corner numbers I
was telling you about

897
01:05:37.845 --> 01:05:39.564
that they found in his loft.

898
01:05:39.564 --> 01:05:42.625
His mother said it was the
first song he ever recorded.

899
01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:44.567
when he was 13 years old.

900
01:05:44.567 --> 01:05:45.607
- You all right. mate?

901
01:05:45.607 --> 01:05:47.367
- Uh. I'm fine.

902
01:05:47.367 --> 01:05:49.788
Lemme buy you a drink.

903
01:05:49.788 --> 01:05:52.046
- Nah. I'm all right. thanks.

904
01:05:52.046 --> 01:05:53.868
- Oh. come on.

905
01:05:53.868 --> 01:05:55.724
- Honestly. I'm all right.

906
01:05:55.724 --> 01:05:58.428
How many nights are you
spending here at the hotel?

907
01:05:58.428 --> 01:06:01.970
- Yeah. I'm just going
back to London tomorrow.

908
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:04.900
It's quite a place you got here.

909
01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.578
Penelope was here the other day.

910
01:06:07.578 --> 01:06:12.293
- Penelope. yeah. She was
working here yesterday. actually.

911
01:06:12.293 --> 01:06:14.126
- Ah. yeah. Yesterday.

912
01:06:15.679 --> 01:06:17.199
Do you know her well?

913
01:06:17.199 --> 01:06:18.699
- Nah. not really.

914
01:06:21.343 --> 01:06:22.275
- She's cool.

915
01:06:22.275 --> 01:06:25.025
- Yeah. she's all right. I guess.

916
01:06:38.002 --> 01:06:39.335
- If you say so.

917
01:06:41.217 --> 01:06:43.578
Did you two ever go out?

918
01:06:43.578 --> 01:06:46.078
- What kinda question is that?

919
01:06:49.213 --> 01:06:51.397
- I'll get over her.

920
01:06:51.397 --> 01:06:53.557
- Mate. you barely even know the girl.

921
01:06:53.557 --> 01:06:56.390
I think you're a little bit drunk.

922
01:06:58.416 --> 01:07:00.458
- We spent a lot of time together.

923
01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:01.541
- Oh. really?

924
01:07:02.437 --> 01:07:05.856
She shouldn't be spending
time with the clients.

925
01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:09.354
- Well. I won't tell if you don't.

926
01:07:09.354 --> 01:07:10.187
Seriously.

927
01:07:11.178 --> 01:07:12.117
I think I love her.

928
01:07:12.117 --> 01:07:14.517
- Yeah. yeah. You said that already.

929
01:07:14.517 --> 01:07:16.593
- Well. you don't believe me.

930
01:07:16.593 --> 01:07:19.760
- Mate. I don't even know who you are.

931
01:07:21.145 --> 01:07:22.728
- What's your name?

932
01:07:23.674 --> 01:07:25.091
- Arturo Bandini.

933
01:07:28.453 --> 01:07:29.870
- Arturo Bandini.

934
01:07:33.889 --> 01:07:35.889
That's a hell of a name.

935
01:07:37.317 --> 01:07:39.114
Brian. if you're out there.

936
01:07:39.114 --> 01:07:42.213
as the late David Watford
so steadfastly claimed.

937
01:07:42.213 --> 01:07:43.772
I hope you're well.

938
01:07:43.772 --> 01:07:47.013
But I think that's just wishful thinking.

939
01:08:22.053 --> 01:08:24.220
- What are you doing here?

940
01:08:26.597 --> 01:08:28.014
- I'm a bit lost.

941
01:08:28.968 --> 01:08:32.610
- Maybe you need to find
your way out of here then.

942
01:08:32.610 --> 01:08:33.610
- Good idea.

943
01:08:36.437 --> 01:08:37.597
Can I get the camera. please?

944
01:08:37.597 --> 01:08:38.430
- Fast.

945
01:08:41.997 --> 01:08:42.830
Faster.

946
01:08:54.008 --> 01:08:55.696
Leave the cat alone.

947
01:08:55.696 --> 01:08:57.914
Leave the cat alone.

948
01:08:57.914 --> 01:08:58.747
Take your hat.

949
01:08:58.747 --> 01:09:00.114
- Ah. yeah. Thanks.

950
01:09:00.114 --> 01:09:03.394
- Don't wanna see you here again.

951
01:09:03.394 --> 01:09:04.227
Go.
- Yeah.

952
01:09:54.377 --> 01:09:57.774
and I call to the moon

953
01:10:11.454 --> 01:10:12.454
- What's up.

954
01:10:14.116 --> 01:10:15.817
- I need to be leaving.

955
01:10:15.817 --> 01:10:17.317
- I half expected.

956
01:10:18.697 --> 01:10:20.035
You haven't even had a chance to listen

957
01:10:20.035 --> 01:10:22.057
to what I've done with the songs.

958
01:10:22.057 --> 01:10:23.956
- I'm sure they're amazing.

959
01:10:23.956 --> 01:10:25.433
- When are you leaving?

960
01:10:25.433 --> 01:10:26.766
- Today.
- Today?

961
01:10:28.274 --> 01:10:30.153
I was hoping you'd be able to add

962
01:10:30.153 --> 01:10:32.436
some of your magic to them.

963
01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:33.673
- Next time.

964
01:10:33.673 --> 01:10:35.390
- And when will that be?

965
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:36.890
Another two years?

966
01:10:38.356 --> 01:10:40.254
- I hope not.

967
01:10:40.254 --> 01:10:41.087
- Me too.

968
01:10:42.537 --> 01:10:44.494
It's been great to see you.

969
01:10:44.494 --> 01:10:45.327
- You too.

970
01:10:46.494 --> 01:10:51.257
- Come again any time.
It's your place. after all.

971
01:10:51.257 --> 01:10:54.007
- No. it's yours. It's your place

972
01:11:15.177 --> 01:11:16.788
- Peter.

973
01:11:16.788 --> 01:11:18.228
- Hmm?

974
01:11:18.228 --> 01:11:19.061
Hey.

975
01:11:20.426 --> 01:11:22.388
- You look awful.

976
01:11:22.388 --> 01:11:24.055
- Thanks. I feel it.

977
01:11:25.487 --> 01:11:28.671
- Did you sleep here last night?

978
01:11:28.671 --> 01:11:29.671
- I saw him.

979
01:11:30.602 --> 01:11:33.626
I got hammered over at the pub.

980
01:11:33.626 --> 01:11:36.153
That's where he's staying.

981
01:11:36.153 --> 01:11:38.804
I passed out in the garden.

982
01:11:38.804 --> 01:11:41.172
When I woke up. he was looking over me.

983
01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:43.550
holding a candlestick.

984
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:45.892
Chased me off the property.

985
01:11:45.892 --> 01:11:48.309
- Jesus. Peter. you're crazy.

986
01:11:49.689 --> 01:11:51.189
- Crazy about you.

987
01:11:53.631 --> 01:11:55.714
I deleted all the photos.

988
01:11:57.365 --> 01:12:00.009
I'm not doing this anymore.

989
01:12:00.009 --> 01:12:04.592
I wanna take pictures of
trees and greenery and nature.

990
01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:08.772
And you. if you'll let me.

991
01:12:08.772 --> 01:12:11.330
I'm done with this game.

992
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:15.172
- Yeah. well. glad as I am to hear that.

993
01:12:15.172 --> 01:12:18.506
you shouldn't do it
just because I tell you.

994
01:12:18.506 --> 01:12:19.339
- Look.

995
01:12:21.023 --> 01:12:23.356
It's my decision. obviously.

996
01:12:24.505 --> 01:12:27.305
But you've influenced that as well.

997
01:12:27.305 --> 01:12:32.148
You were right. If he wants
to be dead. let him be dead.

998
01:12:32.148 --> 01:12:35.815
It's not right for me
to unearth him. right?

999
01:12:38.344 --> 01:12:39.725
- Coffee?

1000
01:12:39.725 --> 01:12:42.142
- Yeah. Make it a strong one.

1001
01:12:56.865 --> 01:12:58.758
- Why is his phone-

1002
01:12:58.758 --> 01:13:00.508
Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1003
01:13:02.135 --> 01:13:02.968
Jack? Hi.

1004
01:13:05.196 --> 01:13:07.014
I'm good. Can you hear me now?

1005
01:13:07.014 --> 01:13:08.999
I've been calling you forever.

1006
01:13:08.999 --> 01:13:10.700
What's up with your phone? Yeah.

1007
01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.833
Ah. it's good. it's
good. it's good. it's good.

1008
01:13:12.833 --> 01:13:14.138
- Where are you?
- I'm in Brighton.

1009
01:13:14.138 --> 01:13:15.160
I'm in Brighton.

1010
01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.869
- That's like miles away.
We're gonna miss the plane.

1011
01:13:17.869 --> 01:13:20.720
Nah. we got plenty of time.

1012
01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.320
They'll wait for us.

1013
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.840
- Can you hear me now?

1014
01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.757
What?

1015
01:13:24.757 --> 01:13:25.828
You're breaking up on me.
- Hello?

1016
01:13:25.828 --> 01:13:27.137
- I can't hear ya.

1017
01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:28.054
- Oh. Jack!

1018
01:13:32.668 --> 01:13:33.501
Really?

1019
01:14:04.157 --> 01:14:06.132
What are you doing?

1020
01:14:06.132 --> 01:14:07.671
Sorry. sorry. sorry.

1021
01:14:07.671 --> 01:14:08.504
- Come on.

1022
01:14:09.516 --> 01:14:10.349
Hi.
- Hi.

1023
01:14:12.934 --> 01:14:13.777
- How are you?

1024
01:14:18.973 --> 01:14:20.050
- Hi. Dad.

1025
01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:20.913
Hello. my darling.

1026
01:14:20.913 --> 01:14:22.470
- Yeah.
- So?

1027
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:23.750
- Yeah. I fixed it.

1028
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:26.926
Penelope. you're a star.

1029
01:14:26.926 --> 01:14:28.798
- Dave. Yeah. I got something for you.

1030
01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.662
Or something for us. actually.
It's a big. big story.

1031
01:14:31.662 --> 01:14:34.242
But I need to remain in the shadows.

1032
01:14:34.242 --> 01:14:37.282
I found Brian Corner. The Brian Corner.

1033
01:14:37.282 --> 01:14:39.637
I've got plenty of evidence.

1034
01:14:39.637 --> 01:14:41.459
And he's alive and well.

1035
01:14:41.459 --> 01:14:43.215
But here's the hitch.

1036
01:14:43.215 --> 01:14:46.520
I can't take credit for any
of the photos. or be involved.

1037
01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.584
I need you to do that.

1038
01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:51.102
If I tell you why. I'll have to kill you.

1039
01:14:51.102 --> 01:14:54.435
I'll be back in London tomorrow. See ya.

1040
01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:06.422
- I've been calling you forever.
What's up with your phone?

1041
01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:10.665
- Oh. So where did you call me from?

1042
01:15:12.667 --> 01:15:15.611
- Ah. Does this thing even work?

1043
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:16.944
- Apparently so.

1044
01:15:20.967 --> 01:15:24.347
- I was beginning to
think you wouldn't come.

1045
01:15:24.347 --> 01:15:27.264
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1046
01:15:28.544 --> 01:15:32.208
- So I was thinking before you came.

1047
01:15:32.208 --> 01:15:33.611
I don't know what to call you.

1048
01:15:33.611 --> 01:15:35.632
I mean. Jack isn't really your name.

1049
01:15:35.632 --> 01:15:39.167
That's what I've been calling you.

1050
01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:40.917
Can I call you Brian?

1051
01:15:42.164 --> 01:15:43.581
I'd prefer Brian.

1052
01:15:44.586 --> 01:15:46.003
I'll be discreet.

1053
01:15:47.044 --> 01:15:50.004
- I'd rather you didn't mention his name.

1054
01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:51.423
- It is who you are.

1055
01:15:51.423 --> 01:15:52.440
- Not anymore.

1056
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.122
- How am I supposed to introduce
you to friends and family?

1057
01:15:55.122 --> 01:15:56.502
- Jack.
- Jack?

1058
01:15:56.502 --> 01:15:57.335
- Jack.

1059
01:16:00.061 --> 01:16:02.722
- I guess it makes sense.

1060
01:16:02.722 --> 01:16:06.840
But why Jack? Why did you
choose to call yourself Jack?

1061
01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:09.058
- Jack is a very good friend of mine.

1062
01:16:09.058 --> 01:16:11.141
He's my partner in crime.

1063
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.080
I use his identity to make things easier.

1064
01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.080
You'll meet him someday.

1065
01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.701
- I see. Where is Jack?

1066
01:16:24.701 --> 01:16:27.136
- Sussex. I was just visiting him.

1067
01:16:27.136 --> 01:16:30.636
- I thought you were visiting your sister.

1068
01:16:32.141 --> 01:16:33.519
- I lied.

1069
01:16:33.519 --> 01:16:35.581
- Why did you lie again?

1070
01:16:35.581 --> 01:16:37.538
- Because if I told you the truth.

1071
01:16:37.538 --> 01:16:39.394
then I would've had to
tell you the whole truth.

1072
01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:42.514
and you wouldn't have believed me anyway.

1073
01:16:42.514 --> 01:16:45.931
I figured I'd spare us both a long story.

1074
01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:50.498
- I usually don't like liars.

1075
01:16:50.498 --> 01:16:54.248
but I guess in this case
I can understand it.

1076
01:16:56.397 --> 01:16:59.196
- I thought you'd understand.

1077
01:16:59.196 --> 01:17:02.578
- Anyway. we better hurry up.
We're gonna miss the plane.

1078
01:17:02.578 --> 01:17:04.503
- Don't I have time to get a pint?

1079
01:17:04.503 --> 01:17:05.753
- No. Let's go.

1080
01:17:10.802 --> 01:17:11.969
- Hi. my love.

1081
01:17:15.223 --> 01:17:16.730
Uh.

1082
01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:17.964
Huh.

1083
01:17:17.964 --> 01:17:20.631
A light sleeper all of a sudden?

1084
01:17:24.524 --> 01:17:26.503
You can't fool me.

1085
01:17:26.503 --> 01:17:27.336
Wake up.

1086
01:17:28.335 --> 01:17:30.002
- Oh! Don't do that!

1087
01:17:30.838 --> 01:17:33.158
Get your stuff and get out.

1088
01:17:33.158 --> 01:17:33.991
- What?

1089
01:17:35.233 --> 01:17:37.532
- Get out. I'm serious.

1090
01:17:37.532 --> 01:17:39.476
- I've got some incredible news for us.

1091
01:17:39.476 --> 01:17:42.561
- Oh God. what now? I can't wait.

1092
01:17:42.561 --> 01:17:45.075
- We're rich. We're rich. we're rich.

1093
01:17:45.075 --> 01:17:47.673
I found him. I got closeup photos of him.

1094
01:17:47.673 --> 01:17:50.612
I even met him in person.
It's definitely him.

1095
01:17:50.612 --> 01:17:52.473
- Can you mention that man's name again?

1096
01:17:52.473 --> 01:17:54.249
- It's just one more day. tomorrow.

1097
01:17:54.249 --> 01:17:55.929
- I'm going meeting Andrew in town.

1098
01:17:55.929 --> 01:17:57.428
He's gonna give me a little advance.

1099
01:17:57.428 --> 01:17:59.744
He thinks I should sell each
photo to the highest bidder.

1100
01:17:59.744 --> 01:18:02.506
It's exciting stuff. Hey?

1101
01:18:02.506 --> 01:18:03.339
Let me take you for lunch.

1102
01:18:03.339 --> 01:18:05.679
You can go anywhere you
wanna go. You name it.

1103
01:18:05.679 --> 01:18:09.077
Hmm? You name it. we'll go there.

1104
01:18:09.077 --> 01:18:12.454
- Well. even if it is
true. that's a big if.

1105
01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:15.278
it doesn't change anything.

1106
01:18:15.278 --> 01:18:16.918
- It's definite.

1107
01:18:16.918 --> 01:18:19.840
It's definite. and it changes everything.

1108
01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.921
- There's always something with you.

1109
01:18:20.921 --> 01:18:23.285
I've heard it all before.

1110
01:18:23.285 --> 01:18:26.282
What are you talking about?

1111
01:18:26.282 --> 01:18:28.250
- OK. let me see the photos.

1112
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:29.472
Might be better than the ones you took

1113
01:18:29.472 --> 01:18:30.904
of the back of his head.

1114
01:18:30.904 --> 01:18:33.987
- Yeah. OK. well. I'll just
upload them to the computer. OK?

1115
01:18:33.987 --> 01:18:35.987
I need to delete a couple of them.

1116
01:18:35.987 --> 01:18:37.987
- Why do you need to delete them?

1117
01:18:37.987 --> 01:18:39.578
Have you got something to hide?

1118
01:18:39.578 --> 01:18:42.820
Is that why you didn't pick
up your phone for days on end?

1119
01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:45.396
- I was on a stakeout.

1120
01:18:45.396 --> 01:18:48.122
That's why I had my phone off.

1121
01:18:48.122 --> 01:18:49.562
- No. it wasn't. It rang.

1122
01:18:49.562 --> 01:18:52.223
- I thought you didn't wanna
talk about him anymore.

1123
01:18:52.223 --> 01:18:54.084
- Show me the photos.

1124
01:18:54.084 --> 01:18:56.260
- All right. just give me a
chance to back it up on my.

1125
01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.785
Hey. hey. give it. give it to me.

1126
01:18:58.785 --> 01:18:59.673
Give 'em here. Give it here.

1127
01:18:59.673 --> 01:19:01.976
- No. if you haven't got anything to hide.

1128
01:19:01.976 --> 01:19:03.893
I wanna see the photos.

1129
01:19:05.176 --> 01:19:07.094
- Look. it's just. I
wanted to delete a few.

1130
01:19:07.094 --> 01:19:09.437
'cause I wanted you to
see the best ones. OK?

1131
01:19:09.437 --> 01:19:10.994
You know. you're always
so critical of what I do.

1132
01:19:10.994 --> 01:19:12.354
I don't like it.

1133
01:19:12.354 --> 01:19:14.104
- Really? Is that so?

1134
01:19:15.096 --> 01:19:15.929
- Yeah.

1135
01:19:17.993 --> 01:19:19.960
- I wanna see the photos.

1136
01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.900
I won't be so overly
judgmental if they're so good.

1137
01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:24.983
- Listen.
- I'm listening.

1138
01:19:26.193 --> 01:19:28.943
- I met someone when I was there.

1139
01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:33.367
- Who?

1140
01:19:34.555 --> 01:19:37.747
- Just a woman. Just to
help me find Brian Corner.

1141
01:19:37.747 --> 01:19:42.568
She stayed in a place just
round the corner from him.

1142
01:19:42.568 --> 01:19:45.229
We went to a park. a graveyard.
I got a few photos of her.

1143
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:48.845
I just didn't want you to see
them and think anything of it.

1144
01:19:48.845 --> 01:19:51.565
- Really? And what kind of photos?

1145
01:19:51.565 --> 01:19:53.585
- Just in a park. a graveyard.

1146
01:19:53.585 --> 01:19:55.725
and a couple at her house. that's all.

1147
01:19:55.725 --> 01:19:57.725
- A couple at her house?

1148
01:20:00.445 --> 01:20:03.149
How serious was this relationship?

1149
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:06.420
- It's nothing. I was only using
her to get to Brian Corner.

1150
01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:07.626
As soon as I found out she wasn't helpful.

1151
01:20:07.626 --> 01:20:09.543
I came back to you. OK?

1152
01:20:10.441 --> 01:20:13.845
- Really? How exactly did she help you?

1153
01:20:13.845 --> 01:20:16.345
- Well. as it turned out.
she wasn't very helpful.

1154
01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:19.146
You just thought
she might be helpful?

1155
01:20:19.146 --> 01:20:21.583
- Pretty much. yeah.

1156
01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:24.406
- Well. I wanna see what she looks like.

1157
01:20:24.406 --> 01:20:25.906
- OK. if you must.

1158
01:20:28.767 --> 01:20:30.684
- I don't see anything.

1159
01:20:33.427 --> 01:20:34.344
No SD card.

1160
01:20:36.126 --> 01:20:36.959
- What?

1161
01:20:40.206 --> 01:20:42.539
It was definitely. it was
in there. It was in there.

1162
01:20:42.539 --> 01:20:44.311
I only ever take it out to
back it up on the computer.

1163
01:20:44.311 --> 01:20:45.708
It was definitely fucking in there.

1164
01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:49.804
- You must've put it somewhere
else. It can't just fly away.

1165
01:20:49.804 --> 01:20:51.884
- The fucking bitch must've taken it.

1166
01:20:51.884 --> 01:20:53.207
Who?

1167
01:20:53.207 --> 01:20:56.764
- Penelope. the girl I was
just telling you about.

1168
01:20:56.764 --> 01:20:58.910
- Why would she do that?

1169
01:20:58.910 --> 01:21:02.140
- Why do you think? She
obviously saw some worth in it.

1170
01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:03.583
- Are you sure you just
haven't put it somewhere else?

1171
01:21:03.583 --> 01:21:05.833
- No. she fucking stole it.

1172
01:21:06.911 --> 01:21:08.085
How could she have done that?

1173
01:21:08.085 --> 01:21:11.903
- Aw. 'cause I trusted her. stupidly.

1174
01:21:11.903 --> 01:21:14.687
I let her take a few photos.

1175
01:21:14.687 --> 01:21:19.103
Oh. fuck. She must've taken
it when I was in the bathroom.

1176
01:21:19.103 --> 01:21:21.946
- I thought you left
once you got the photos.

1177
01:21:21.946 --> 01:21:23.863
- Ah. not straightaway.

1178
01:21:26.222 --> 01:21:28.639
- You're changing your story.

1179
01:21:29.887 --> 01:21:32.266
Get your stuff and get out.

1180
01:21:32.266 --> 01:21:33.786
I'm finished with your lies.

1181
01:21:33.786 --> 01:21:34.869
Unbelievable.

1182
01:21:37.487 --> 01:21:38.320
- Ugh.

1183
01:21:39.706 --> 01:21:40.539
Ah!

1184
01:21:41.498 --> 01:21:42.331
Fuck.

1185
01:21:48.215 --> 01:21:49.882
I'm gonna cry. Fuck!

1186
01:21:54.772 --> 01:21:56.156
Bitch.

1187
01:21:56.156 --> 01:21:59.323
Ah. I can't fucking believe it. Jesus.

1188
01:22:01.356 --> 01:22:02.939
Shit. Stupid woman.

1189
01:22:07.401 --> 01:22:08.234
Fuck!

1190
01:22:16.217 --> 01:22:20.300
- Oh. and remind me. I
need to pick a new SD card

1191
01:22:21.213 --> 01:22:23.548
from the terminal for my camera.

1192
01:22:23.548 --> 01:22:24.698
- SD card? I got one of those.

1193
01:22:24.698 --> 01:22:26.938
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1194
01:22:26.938 --> 01:22:28.105
- That's good.

1195
01:22:30.947 --> 01:22:31.780
Thanks.

1196
01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:35.578
PP. Why does it have PP on it?

1197
01:22:38.695 --> 01:22:39.890
- I'll tell you when we
get to the penthouse.

1198
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:41.938
- Hey. you've been practicing.

1199
01:22:41.938 --> 01:22:45.053
- Well. yeah. You gotta
help me out. though.

1200
01:23:35.328 --> 01:23:37.919
they could reel a man
