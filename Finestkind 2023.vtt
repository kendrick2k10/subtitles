00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:01.849
Left is port.

57
00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.420
Watch your head

58
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.588
Over here is the shitter.

59
00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:08.856
You can also call it the head.

60
00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:10.491
Don't call it the toilet.

You--you said to the right?

68
00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.042
Huh?

69
00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:33.681
You should have said starboard.

70
00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:35.716
You being smart

71
00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:37.251
No. I just--
I like the idea.

72
00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:38.852
It doesn't matter
which way you're facing.

73
00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:40.688
Starboard is starboard.

74
00:03:40.688 --> 00:03:43.291
You know what. Skeemo?

75
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:46.994
He kind of looks a little
like Justin Bieber. doesn't he?

76
00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:49.263
Yeah.

77
00:03:49.263 --> 00:03:51.131
You're right.

78
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.966
You guys could be twins.

79
00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:56.370
Yeah.

80
00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:03.411
I don't like Justin Bieber.

81
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:05.078
Neither do I.

82
00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:10.384
Okay.

83
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.522
You guys are missing out.

84
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.559
Ah-ha. you think
you're funny.

85
00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:19.793
Guess what?

86
00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:20.894
You're getting a haircut.

87
00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:21.895
Nunesy?
- Yeah?

88
00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:22.963
Get me the clippers.

89
00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:27.301
<i>Ha-ha. you look beautiful.
Charlie boy.</i>

90
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:28.902
<i>You in the Navy now.</i>

91
00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:57.164
Charlie!

92
00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:03.404
<i>Mayday. mayday. mayday.</i>

93
00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:05.673
<i>This is "Harmony."
"Harmony." "Harmony."</i>

94
00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:08.041
<i>We have a hole in the hull.
and we're going down quick.</i>

95
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:12.880
<i>My position is latitude
40-49. longitude 69...</i>

96
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.919
<i> I tell you. man.</i>

97
00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.287
<i>This shit right here.</i>

98
00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:21.889
<i>this bouncing around shit
right here.</i>

99
00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.657
this is why my old man

100
00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:25.559
wanted me to be a doctor.

101
00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.095
I had to tell him. "Dad.

102
00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:31.432
I ain't even gonna graduate
from goddamn high school."

103
00:05:33.434 --> 00:05:37.204
I don't even think
he was paying attention.

104
00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:39.072
At least
your father was home.

105
00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:41.274
- Fuck.
- Oh. man.

106
00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:45.413
My father was home
all the goddamn time.

107
00:05:45.413 --> 00:05:47.581
hating us every inch of it.

108
00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:50.183
Now. the only thing killing
his party when my mama died

109
00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.820
was that us kids
didn't die with her.

110
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.222
So yeah.
he was home. all right.

111
00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:57.691
Finest kind.

112
00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.593
You wanted a hero. Costa.

113
00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:02.295
All you got was another guy
trying to figure it out.

114
00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.297
Hey. man.
I--I got a question.

115
00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:05.799
What the hell
does "finest kind" mean?

116
00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:07.901
You guys are always saying it.

117
00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:10.771
It's an expression
of the trade. my man.

118
00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:12.372
Yeah. but it means
something different

119
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.541
every time you say it.

120
00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:14.608
Hmm.

121
00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:16.410
That's the beauty of it.

122
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.713
Like. sometimes
it can mean "cool."

123
00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.416
Sometimes it can mean
"fuck you."

124
00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:25.586
It just depends
on how you say it.

125
00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:28.221
All right. it's
the Swiss Army Knife of words.

126
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:31.324
perfect for an English major.

127
00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:34.595
- Oh. there we go.
- Oh. yeah.

128
00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:36.564
- Oh!
- All right.

129
00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:38.065

I'll bet you 20 bucks.

242
00:10:46.814 --> 00:10:47.948
20 bucks?

243
00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:49.016
20 bucks. I can see anything.

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:50.751
Skee?

245
00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:55.088
You think you could read. uh.
this little label right here?

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:56.790
Sure.

247
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.325
Bullshit.

248
00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:03.463
What about right here?
- Mm.

249
00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:05.899
I don't know.

250
00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:08.969
Is it a bet?

251
00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:10.771
Okay. 20 bucks?

252
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:11.972
20 bucks.

253
00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:13.106
The top line?

254
00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:15.876
Yeah.

255
00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:19.346
All right.
Don't fucking move it.

256
00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.148
- Okay. all right.
- I'm trying to concentrate.

257
00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:27.154
"This is

which costs so much to brew
and age."

262

Oh. you memorized
that. motherfucker.

263
00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:47.107

- Not dead--hey. Dad.

280
00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:48.068
Not dead--

281
00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:49.937
Hey. Mr. Sykes.

282
00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:51.071
Want a beer?

283
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:54.274
No. I don't want a beer. Tom.

284
00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.876
It's 11:00 in the morning.

285
00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:57.477
What did--
what did you do to your hair?

286
00:12:57.477 --> 00:12:58.745
Oh. I've. uh--

287
00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:01.281
You know what?
For Christ's sake. Charlie.

288
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:02.782
Dad. we're just celebrating.
That's all.

289
00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.085
I mean. we--
we had a rough night.

290
00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:06.286
Yeah. I know.

291
00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.687
Your mother is going
out of her mind

292
00:13:07.687 --> 00:13:09.389
worrying about you.

293
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:10.824
Did she ask about me?

294
00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:12.292
I was in danger too.

295
00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.261
I didn't like this idea
from the start.

296
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:16.629
but now you've had your taste.

297
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.366
You can come clerk with me
for the rest of the summer.

298
00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:22.102
Dad. I'm--
I'm going back again.

299
00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:25.138
Ex--excuse me?

300
00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:27.875
I'm going again.

301
00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:29.910
I'm going back to sea.

302
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.379
I mean. as soon as
we get another. uh--

303
00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:33.780
what do ya call it?

304
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.882
Go for it.

305
00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:38.986
What's it called?

306
00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:40.187
What is it?
It's--

307
00:13:40.187 --> 00:13:41.321
- Site. Charlie.
- Site.

308
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:42.489
As soon as we
get another site.

309
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.024
You know. Tom. your brother

310
00:13:44.024 --> 00:13:46.894
has a chance to be something.

311
00:13:46.894 --> 00:13:48.261
What. a substitute teacher?

312
00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:49.662
He's got an English degree.

313
00:13:52.132 --> 00:13:53.433
He got accepted

314
00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:55.102
to Boston University
law school.

315
00:13:55.102 --> 00:13:56.403
for Christ's sake.

316
00:13:56.403 --> 00:13:58.738
He starts in September.

317
00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:03.076
I--I admire that you wanna pay
your own way.

318
00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:04.077
but I don't want you fishing.

319
00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:05.512
Dad. I'm 22 years old.

320
00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:07.614
And I'd like to see
you make it to 23.

321
00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:08.715
Wise up!

322
00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:09.716
Hey.

323
00:14:10.884 --> 00:14:13.053
These boys almost drowned
last night.

324
00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:16.489
You should be hugging
your boy. not yelling at him.

325
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.260
Just saying.

326
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.136
Who are you?

327
00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:30.370
Nunesy.

328
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.607
Jesus Christ.

329
00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:38.979
Okay. uh. I'm late
for a meeting.

330
00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:40.413
Go see your mother.

331
00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:41.848
She's worried sick.

332
00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:47.187
Cool guy.

333
00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:49.889
I like him.

334
00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:54.627
Law school?

335
00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:56.629
For you?
Is that for real?

336
00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:01.334
You're gonna learn
to sue people and shit?

337
00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.738
I'ma do my best.

338
00:15:25.892 --> 00:15:26.826
Back in a minute.

339
00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:28.061
Stay in the car.

340
00:15:36.336 --> 00:15:38.905
You can take a seat.

341
00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:40.407
I'm good.

342
00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:50.350
One sec.
Just bring it out.

343
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.884
Bring it out.

344
00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:53.386
Eh. screw this.

345
00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:19.079
I was wondering when you'd
find the time to come see me.

346
00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:21.448
I had a few stops to make.

347
00:16:21.448 --> 00:16:22.749
In what goddamn world

348
00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:24.351
do you get away
with that attitude?

349
00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:26.086
Where the hell have you been?
I've been waiting all morning.

350
00:16:26.086 --> 00:16:28.555
The reason I didn't come
in here first thing

351
00:16:28.555 --> 00:16:30.690
was so I could chill out.

352
00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.526
so I wouldn't come in here
and kill you.

353
00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:36.296
I wanna see the maintenance
records on the boat.

354
00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:37.997
- Excuse me?
- The "Harmony."

355
00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.332
Get the file out.

356
00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.500
Let's take a look
at it right now.

357
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.202
You've got
some nerve. Eldridge.

358
00:16:42.202 --> 00:16:43.236
Is it here?

359
00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:44.871
Zero accountability.

360
00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:46.639
Blame your damn shortcomings
on everyone else.

361
00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:48.208
I wanna see
the maintenance record

362
00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.743
on the fucking boat!

363
00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:55.182
Unlike you.
that boat was shipshape.

364
00:16:55.182 --> 00:16:58.118
Crankcase exploded.

365
00:16:58.118 --> 00:17:00.153
I'm assuming it
was the. uh. oh. bearings

366
00:17:00.153 --> 00:17:01.421
you said you were gonna replace

367
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:02.889
or a leaky piston ring
let a spark in.

368
00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:04.491
But either way. it's because
you didn't do your job.

369
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:05.492
You didn't maintain it.

370
00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:06.693
I most certainly did!

371
00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:08.661
You didn't do
the fucking work!

372
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:09.629
Fuck it.

373
00:17:09.629 --> 00:17:11.498
Right. typical Tom Eldridge.

374
00:17:11.498 --> 00:17:15.835
Walk out--on me. the boat.
yourself. your crew.

375
00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:17.937
You have a respons--
whoa!

376
00:17:17.937 --> 00:17:19.906
Tom! Tom!

377
00:17:19.906 --> 00:17:21.741
We were out in that storm
with a hole in our belly.

378
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:23.410
I've never--
- Fuck off!

379
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.677
I've never seen a boat
take on water that fast.

380
00:17:24.677 --> 00:17:26.079
I mean. the bitch went down.

381
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:29.849
You have
an investment out there.

382
00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:31.284
I got my crew.
I got my brother.

383
00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:32.385
We could have died.

384
00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.653
I'm calling the police.

385
00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:36.089
Hold on. Karen.
One second.

386
00:17:36.089 --> 00:17:37.924
Go on. hothead.

387
00:17:37.924 --> 00:17:39.492
Hit me.

388
00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:41.728
Yeah.
- Yeah? Huh?

389
00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.496
I'd love to see you
locked up.

390
00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:45.732
Tom. don't!

391
00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.634
It'd be a waste
of a good punch.

392
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.074
Take a goddamn shower.

393
00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.075
You stink.

394
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:57.444
Like fish.

395
00:17:57.444 --> 00:17:58.678
A bunch of us guys
stinking like fish

396
00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:02.282
made you a millionaire.

397
00:18:02.282 --> 00:18:04.351
Is that his car?

398
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:05.818
Yeah.

399
00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:23.035
Now he can smell
like the money too.

400
00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:43.756
Man. when do we
go fishing again?

401
00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:48.395
Might be a little while
until we get another boat.

402
00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:51.063
Why?

403
00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:52.732
It wasn't your fault.

404
00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:57.036
Well. that's not the word
ol' Whitey's

405
00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:59.005
gonna put out there.

406
00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:00.173
Your Dad's right.

407
00:19:00.173 --> 00:19:02.342
You should probably clerk.

408
00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:03.543
Fuck me.

409
00:19:05.578 --> 00:19:09.382
I gotta hear this
from you now?

410
00:19:09.382 --> 00:19:10.483
Man. you know.
when I was little.

411
00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:13.286
you never told me what to do.

412
00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:14.621
No?

413
00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:16.055
No. you--you. like--

414
00:19:16.055 --> 00:19:19.192
you'd either ignore me.
or you took me with you.

415
00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:20.593
and you showed me stuff:

416
00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:23.363
how to jump bikes.

417
00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:25.632
how to water ski.

418
00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:27.400
how to light firecrackers.

419
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.768
Oh. yeah.

420
00:19:28.768 --> 00:19:30.069
And how to know
when to throw 'em.

421
00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:31.471
Know where
the emergency room was.

422
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:34.173
Yeah.
Yeah.

423
00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:35.908
I always knew where I stood
with you. you know?

424
00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:38.945
Get lost. or get over here.

425
00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:40.747
Simple.

426
00:19:40.747 --> 00:19:44.417
And the--the "get lost"
never felt personal.

427
00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:48.921
But the "get over here"
always did.

428
00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:14.947
You boys.

429
00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:16.683
Mom.

430
00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:18.551
Oh. I knew you'd be okay.

431
00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:20.587
You were together.

432
00:20:20.587 --> 00:20:22.722
I couldn't lose
both of you at once.

433
00:20:26.526 --> 00:20:29.095
I had you early and you late.

434
00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:31.398
And I always hoped
you'd find each other grown up.

435
00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:33.266
but just not like this.

436
00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:34.667
Oh.

437
00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:36.235
Okay.

438
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:38.237
All right.

439
00:21:19.512 --> 00:21:20.880
Your toilet broke?

440
00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.884
Just trying
to save on septic.

441
00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.389
Why'd you park so far away?

442
00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:31.223
Didn't wanna wake up Kathy.

443
00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:32.825
She hasn't lived here
in six months.

444
00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:34.727
I mean. she moved out.

445
00:21:34.727 --> 00:21:37.263
That's too bad.

446
00:21:37.263 --> 00:21:38.831
I liked her.

447
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:40.500
I can give you
her phone number.

448
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.335
You--you can ask her out.

449
00:21:45.104 --> 00:21:47.106
How you doing otherwise?

450
00:21:47.106 --> 00:21:49.576
Uh. I've had
a better couple days. Ray.

451
00:21:49.576 --> 00:21:51.043
Yeah.

452
00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:52.779
I got a proposition for you.

453
00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:54.246
What's that?

454
00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:55.982
Need you to take
my boat out for a run.

455
00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:57.550
I've got something
I have to do.

456
00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.918
And you heard
I was available?

457
00:21:58.918 --> 00:22:00.319
Boat's due out tomorrow.

458
00:22:02.188 --> 00:22:04.457
Yeah. well. I just got in.
and I'm beat.

459
00:22:04.457 --> 00:22:05.792
Tomorrow.

460
00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:07.026
Will you take her or not?

461
00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:09.962
Jesus C--Christ. Ray.

462
00:22:09.962 --> 00:22:12.632
I mean. I just wanna take
a goddamn breath.

463
00:22:12.632 --> 00:22:14.534
I got a crew
I gotta look out for.

464
00:22:14.534 --> 00:22:16.736
Bring 'em.
My crew's bound.

465
00:22:17.937 --> 00:22:19.372
Just like that?

466
00:22:19.372 --> 00:22:21.340
- Just like what?
-  I haven't fished

467
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.142
for you in years.

468
00:22:23.142 --> 00:22:24.944
and you just take the boat out?

469
00:22:26.212 --> 00:22:28.080
Yes or no?

470
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.849
No!

471
00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:32.051
I'd like to help you out.
Ray. but you--

472
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:34.421
you make it
pretty goddamn tough.

473
00:22:43.563 --> 00:22:44.797
Tommy?

474
00:22:54.574 --> 00:22:55.942
Please?

475
00:23:05.618 --> 00:23:08.555
Yeah. okay. Pop.

476
00:23:08.555 --> 00:23:10.423
Okay.

477
00:23:10.423 --> 00:23:11.758
Well. have fun.

478
00:23:11.758 --> 00:23:13.225
Just don't get too hungover.

479
00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:15.027
Yeah. you buy a keg and tell
me not to get too drunk.

480
00:23:15.027 --> 00:23:16.963
Tomorrow. you gotta be
on the boat at 8:00 a.m...

481
00:23:16.963 --> 00:23:18.865
We're doing gear work all day.

482
00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:23.436
Up on the third floor.

483
00:23:23.436 --> 00:23:26.305
Yeah. Costa and I
used to live there.

484
00:23:26.305 --> 00:23:27.306
What's up. Jamie?

485
00:23:28.775 --> 00:23:31.911
Beer delivery this way.

486
00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:33.145
Charlie!

487
00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:38.117
Boom!

488
00:23:42.455 --> 00:23:44.323
Fuck.

489
00:23:44.323 --> 00:23:45.492
We got tail.

490
00:23:45.492 --> 00:23:46.959
We got linguica.

491
00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:50.196
We got the Virgin Mary
in the bathtub.

492
00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:52.932
Uh-uh. not too much
in the soup.

493
00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:55.267
There's plenty of meat
everywhere else.

494
00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:56.736
All right.

495
00:23:56.736 --> 00:23:59.539
Charlie. meet Anne Marie.

496
00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:00.873
Hey.

497
00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:02.842
- My dry-land sweetheart.
- How you doing?

498
00:24:02.842 --> 00:24:04.110
Hey. Anne. this is Charlie.

499
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.945
Uh. Tom's way. way
.

500
00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:07.346
Good to meet you.

501
00:24:07.346 --> 00:24:08.948
Ah. I heard all
about you. Charlie.

502
00:24:08.948 --> 00:24:10.750
- Really?
- I hope you like to eat.

503
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.519
I do.

504
00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:14.787
Oh. [speaks Portuguese].

505
00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:17.089
.

506
00:24:17.089 --> 00:24:18.157
Welcome to our house.

507
00:24:18.157 --> 00:24:19.391
Thanks for having me.

508
00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:20.827
Go back to work.

509
00:24:20.827 --> 00:24:22.962
- What?
- Go pump the keg.

510
00:24:24.564 --> 00:24:26.232
Yes. sir.

511
00:24:29.435 --> 00:24:32.271
Hey. where'd you get
such a cute brother?

512
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:33.873
Beats me.

513
00:24:33.873 --> 00:24:36.142
But not an ounce
of pussy in him.

514
00:24:36.142 --> 00:24:38.778
Uh-uh. unlike you two.

515
00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:43.082
Hey. that's not a way
in which a pregnant woman

516
00:24:43.082 --> 00:24:44.450
should be talking.

517
00:24:45.618 --> 00:24:46.619
- Oh.
- Oh.

518
00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:47.954
Ay.

519
00:24:47.954 --> 00:24:49.956
Hey. sweetheart.

520
00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:51.257
Mm. you need a shave.

521
00:24:51.257 --> 00:24:52.625
- Scratchy?
- Yeah. mm-hmm.

522
00:24:55.862 --> 00:24:57.597
I got us another site.

523
00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:01.267
But how?

524
00:25:01.267 --> 00:25:05.938
Like--like. after yesterday?
What boat?

525
00:25:05.938 --> 00:25:07.907
My old man's.

526
00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:12.879
When?

527
00:25:14.847 --> 00:25:17.316
8:00 tomorrow. on the dock.

528
00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:20.553
- Thank you.
- Hey. good to meet you.

529
00:25:20.553 --> 00:25:22.154
Good to meet you.

530
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:31.530
Keep it pumping. white boy.

531
00:25:44.043 --> 00:25:45.912
I'll tell you when to stop.

532
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.061
When.

533
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:03.562
All right.

534
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.598
Charles'll get
in trouble with that.

535
00:26:06.733 --> 00:26:07.934
Charles better hurry.

536
00:26:07.934 --> 00:26:11.470
'cause he's got about 17 hours
to do so.

537
00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:16.442
I'm gonna need a lot of help
from you today. Charlie.

538
00:26:16.442 --> 00:26:17.810
Oh. yeah?

539
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.979
You're gonna have to do
just what I ask you to.

540
00:26:20.947 --> 00:26:23.783
Really?

541
00:26:23.783 --> 00:26:26.018
What about Skeemo?

542
00:26:26.018 --> 00:26:27.586
What about him?

543
00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:29.488
I don't know.
You guys together or something?

544
00:26:30.957 --> 00:26:32.591
Why would you think that?

545
00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:36.462
Well. 'cause you came to see
him the morning we got in.

546
00:26:36.462 --> 00:26:38.665
I know you know that's
not why I came to see him.

547
00:26:40.767 --> 00:26:41.834
I was doing Skeemo a favor.

548
00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:43.202
You can ask him about it.

549
00:26:44.136 --> 00:26:46.238
I'm not no dealer.

550
00:26:46.238 --> 00:26:48.174
And I sure as shit
ain't no one's girlfriend.

551
00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:50.509
you got that?

552
00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:52.011
All right.

553
00:26:52.011 --> 00:26:54.246
All right. I'm sorry I asked.

554
00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:56.015
Well. does
that mean you'll do it?

555
00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.118
Do what?

556
00:27:01.721 --> 00:27:03.690
Whatever I ask you to.

557
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.557
I still got it. I think.

558
00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:06.826
You never had it.

559
00:27:06.826 --> 00:27:08.127
No. I think I do.

560
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:10.262
No.
That was awful on your part.

561
00:27:10.262 --> 00:27:11.463
Mabes?

562
00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:12.932
Mabel?

563
00:27:12.932 --> 00:27:14.300
Give me a ride somewhere.

564
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.703
No. walk.
Three's a crowd.

565
00:27:16.703 --> 00:27:18.404
I can't feel my feet.

566
00:27:19.939 --> 00:27:21.674
Come on.

567
00:27:21.674 --> 00:27:23.009
It's not very far.

568
00:27:24.677 --> 00:27:25.644
Ha-ha.

569
00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:41.493
Get out.

570
00:27:46.232 --> 00:27:47.900
See you tomorrow. Charlie.

571
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.601
Gear work. 8:00 a.m. sharp.

572
00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:52.071
- All right.
- Oh.

573
00:27:52.071 --> 00:27:54.606
Just so you know.

574
00:27:54.606 --> 00:27:57.877
Tom does not like it
if we're late.

575
00:27:57.877 --> 00:28:00.612
Okay. all right. Noted.

576
00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:01.848
Hey. Mabel!

577
00:28:01.848 --> 00:28:03.215
Where are you going?

578
00:28:03.215 --> 00:28:04.583
Somewhere else.

579
00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:05.617
Come on up here.

580
00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:07.086
I got money for ya.

581
00:28:08.287 --> 00:28:09.722
You mean you got
my money for me?

582
00:28:09.722 --> 00:28:12.391
Okay.
You want it. or don't you?

583
00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:18.130
Just wait here.
I'll be a minute.

584
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.767
Hey. what. are you ashamed?

585
00:28:20.767 --> 00:28:22.068
Ashamed of what?

586
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.772
I'm not ashamed of nothing.

587
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.175
Come on.

588
00:28:38.785 --> 00:28:39.786
Hey.

589
00:28:39.786 --> 00:28:40.853
Just like I told you. huh?

590
00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:46.158
Look who it is.

591
00:28:48.995 --> 00:28:51.864
So who are you?

592
00:28:51.864 --> 00:28:53.499
I'm Charlie.

593
00:28:53.499 --> 00:28:54.566
Oh.

594
00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.668
I'm Paulette.

595
00:28:56.668 --> 00:28:58.871
- You're short 20 bucks.

596
00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:01.740

Uh. I'm from. uh.

Padanaram.

600
00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:11.784
I can't even spell Padanaram.

601
00:29:11.784 --> 00:29:13.685
Yeah. it's spelled
with six zeros.

602
00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:15.187
Rich kid. huh?

603
00:29:15.187 --> 00:29:17.023
So what. you gonna fuck
my daughter and then dump her?

604
00:29:17.023 --> 00:29:18.324
Mom.

605
00:29:18.324 --> 00:29:19.525
Am I wrong?

606
00:29:21.193 --> 00:29:22.761
Am I?

607
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:26.899
Chucky. Tommy Bahama.
whatever the fuck your name is?

608
00:29:26.899 --> 00:29:28.801
Go.

609
00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:30.937
Hey. drop something off

610
00:29:30.937 --> 00:29:31.971
Drop it yourself.

00:29:31.971 --> 00:29:33.405
Come on!

612
00:29:35.241 --> 00:29:36.375
Mabel.

613
00:29:36.375 --> 00:29:37.844
Hey. look. your mom's wrong.

614
00:29:37.844 --> 00:29:39.711
That's not what I'm about.

615
00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:40.847
Look. I know we just met.

616
00:29:40.847 --> 00:29:42.214
but I really like you.
all right?

617
00:29:42.214 --> 00:29:44.984
You need to know
some shit about me. Charlie.

618
00:29:44.984 --> 00:29:46.218
All right.
I'm interested in stuff.

619
00:29:46.218 --> 00:29:48.420
I'm interested in myself.

620
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.890
You know. I'm a brave person.

621
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:52.324
All right. I look after me

622
00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:55.327
'cause I'm the only one
that's doing that.

623
00:29:55.327 --> 00:29:56.562
All right.
and you know what I want?

624
00:29:56.562 --> 00:29:58.497
I wanna give myself a shot.

625
00:29:58.497 --> 00:30:00.199
All right?
I want--I wanna make the most

626
00:30:00.199 --> 00:30:01.934
out of myself and of my life.

627
00:30:01.934 --> 00:30:04.370
And I'm not sure I'm gonna
do it. but I know that I can.

628
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.772
Does that make sense to you?

629
00:30:06.772 --> 00:30:08.674
Yeah. you wanna be
your own hero.

630
00:30:17.349 --> 00:30:19.485
It's just
where I'm from. right.

631
00:30:19.485 --> 00:30:20.853
It's not where I'm going.

632
00:30:20.853 --> 00:30:22.354
Okay.

633
00:30:22.354 --> 00:30:23.822
So let's go.

634
00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:31.964
My car is this way. dummy.

635
00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:43.242
I've been up here
on my own since I was 17.

636
00:31:02.962 --> 00:31:05.231
This is me.

637
00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:11.303
You're beautiful.

638
00:31:50.376 --> 00:31:52.078
Is he still fucking
looking at me?

639
00:31:52.078 --> 00:31:53.445
Yeah.

640
00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:54.846
I can't fucking do this
while he's looking at me.

641
00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:56.115
It's like taking a piss.

642
00:31:56.115 --> 00:31:59.185
I can feel his eyes
fucking burning my neck.

643
00:31:59.185 --> 00:32:00.819
Fucking Eldridge. man.

644
00:32:00.819 --> 00:32:02.554
Dude still scares
the piss out of me.

645
00:32:02.554 --> 00:32:04.823
He scares the piss
out of everybody.

646
00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:08.961
Where the hell is Charlie?

647
00:32:08.961 --> 00:32:12.631
He better fucking get here
before Tom does.

648
00:32:12.631 --> 00:32:16.135
Oh. man.
Here we go.

649
00:32:16.135 --> 00:32:18.404
- Thanks.
- See ya. mate.

650
00:32:21.407 --> 00:32:22.808
Ray. what's up?

651
00:32:22.808 --> 00:32:25.511
Got some twine tops
and rings to drop off.

652
00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:26.545
So drop 'em.

653
00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:35.421
All these years on draggers.

654
00:32:35.421 --> 00:32:37.923
I hope you haven't forgotten
how to scallop.

655
00:32:39.058 --> 00:32:40.092
You all right?

656
00:32:40.092 --> 00:32:41.893
Yeah. finest kind.

657
00:32:41.893 --> 00:32:44.230
I've been working
the channel. killing it.

658
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:47.366
Big as pie plates.

659
00:32:47.366 --> 00:32:49.068
It's marked down
up in the wheelhouse.

660
00:32:49.068 --> 00:32:51.670
Yeah. well. yeah. I have
some ideas of my own.

661
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.672
Well. my boat. my ideas.

662
00:32:53.672 --> 00:32:55.774
I can stay home.
You can take her out.

663
00:32:55.774 --> 00:32:57.276
I don't wanna tango
with you right now. Tom.

664
00:32:57.276 --> 00:32:58.510
I don't wanna tango
with you. Ray.

665
00:32:58.510 --> 00:32:59.811
You keep an eye on the shoes.

666
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:02.281
I don't want you
fucking up my dredges.

667
00:33:02.281 --> 00:33:05.051
No more than 12 knots
steaming out.

668
00:33:05.051 --> 00:33:06.885
This ain't a fucking race.

669
00:33:17.463 --> 00:33:18.397
Hey.

670
00:33:18.397 --> 00:33:19.798
Come on. guys.

671
00:33:27.573 --> 00:33:28.974
Where's my fucking brother?

672
00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:46.292
- Hey.
- Hey.

673
00:33:46.292 --> 00:33:47.793
You were asleep.

674
00:33:47.793 --> 00:33:49.661
but the rest of you is awake.

675
00:34:07.713 --> 00:34:10.782
You like me. Charlie?

676
00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:12.118
Yeah.

677
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.488
I like you too.

678
00:34:26.665 --> 00:34:28.167
I like everything about you.

679
00:34:29.635 --> 00:34:32.504
Like me lower.

680
00:34:32.504 --> 00:34:33.805
Yeah.

681
00:34:53.859 --> 00:34:57.596
Who's calling you so early?

682
00:34:57.596 --> 00:35:00.399
It's not so early.

683
00:35:00.399 --> 00:35:02.901
What do you mean?

684
00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:05.637
I keep cardboard
on the windows.

685
00:35:05.637 --> 00:35:07.706
- What?
- I like it dark when I sleep.

686
00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:13.212
What--dude!

687
00:35:13.212 --> 00:35:15.881
Shit!

688
00:35:15.881 --> 00:35:17.115
What time is it?

689
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:19.485
Oh. uh. it's 8:23.

690
00:35:19.485 --> 00:35:21.119
- No!
- Skeemo.

691
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.454
Skeemo's calling.

692
00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:23.989
Skeemo!
Skeemo. it's Charlie.

693
00:35:23.989 --> 00:35:25.991
We've been looking for you.
You fucked up. man.

694
00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:27.459
We're in the harbor.
We're leaving.

695
00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:29.461
- Whoa!
<i>- Is that Charlie?</i>

696
00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:33.199
Ask college boy what he doesn't
understand about "8:00."

697
00:35:33.199 --> 00:35:35.701
<i>Tell him we'll see him
in ten days.</i>

698
00:35:35.701 --> 00:35:37.703
- Thomas--
- Skeemo.

699
00:35:37.703 --> 00:35:39.070
Hey. Charlie.

700
00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.439
This is Costa.
Where are you?

701
00:35:40.439 --> 00:35:41.607
Yo. I'm at Mabel's.

702
00:35:41.607 --> 00:35:42.641
Where's Mabel's?

703
00:35:42.641 --> 00:35:43.775
East Rodney French!

704
00:35:43.775 --> 00:35:45.277
All right.
you still got time.

705
00:35:45.277 --> 00:35:46.778
Mabel. just get him on
to the hurricane deck. okay?

706
00:35:46.778 --> 00:35:48.480
<i>Just leave now.</i>
- All right. we're coming.

707
00:35:48.947 --> 00:35:50.416
Not a fucking chance.

708
00:35:50.416 --> 00:35:51.750
You got your keys?

709
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.118
Yeah. I got them right here.

710
00:35:56.655 --> 00:35:57.789
Go. go!

711
00:35:57.789 --> 00:35:59.358
Right here. right here.

712
00:36:04.263 --> 00:36:05.331
Go. go!

713
00:36:09.735 --> 00:36:11.270
Whoa!

714
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.438
Mabel!

715
00:36:12.438 --> 00:36:13.639
Whoa!

716
00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:16.708
Oh. my God.

717
00:36:32.458 --> 00:36:34.560
Oh. shit!
We're on the sidewalk!

718
00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:38.297
Mabel--whoa!

719
00:36:42.401 --> 00:36:43.369
Shit.

720
00:36:46.805 --> 00:36:49.140
Slow the fuck down!

721
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.842
Oh. my God.

722
00:36:50.842 --> 00:36:54.646
Mabel. fuck. you can drive.

723
00:36:57.616 --> 00:36:59.785
Come on. man.
This is cold.

724
00:36:59.785 --> 00:37:01.753
He's your little brother.

725
00:37:01.753 --> 00:37:03.455
And plus. we need
the extra hands. Tom.

726
00:37:03.455 --> 00:37:04.823
I'm sorry. rules are rules.

727
00:37:04.823 --> 00:37:06.525
Same for everyone.

728
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.975
Look up.
They're on the dyke.

729
00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.978
Yeah. I see him.

730
00:37:30.416 --> 00:37:32.017
Oh. man.

731
00:37:32.017 --> 00:37:33.319
That's Mabel's car. right?

732
00:37:36.722 --> 00:37:39.825
There--there was something
I wanted to talk to you about.

733
00:37:39.825 --> 00:37:41.527
I was thinking about going
to community college.

734
00:37:41.527 --> 00:37:43.128
Do you think that's
a crazy idea?

735
00:37:43.128 --> 00:37:45.096
It's great.
Wait. what?

736
00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:46.532
I fucking told you
he was gonna come.

737
00:37:46.532 --> 00:37:47.699
Community college.

738
00:37:47.699 --> 00:37:48.900
Do you think
that's a crazy idea?

739
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:49.801
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

740
00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:51.002
He's gonna make it.

741
00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:52.170
What the fuck are you doing?

742
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.405
Just slow down. Tom.

743
00:37:53.405 --> 00:37:54.406
He's your little brother!

744
00:37:54.406 --> 00:37:56.274
Come on.

745
00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:57.709
- Yes or--yes or no?
- Wait. there they are!

746
00:37:57.709 --> 00:37:59.978
Look!
- Oh!

747
00:37:59.978 --> 00:38:01.813
Oh. he's gonna--
he's going for it. man.

748
00:38:01.813 --> 00:38:04.650
Let's go. Charlie!

749
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.217
- Costa. look.
- Right there. man.

750
00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:07.419
He's going for it.

751
00:38:07.419 --> 00:38:08.887
Oh. no fucking way.

752
00:38:08.887 --> 00:38:10.656
Come on. Charlie!

753
00:38:10.656 --> 00:38:11.757
Come on. baby boy!

754
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:17.596
- Wait. Charlie!
- Yeah?

755
00:38:17.596 --> 00:38:18.830
You didn't answer
my question.

756
00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.165
Community college.
- Community college?

757
00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:21.232
Do you think that's
stupid. or don't you?

758
00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:22.801
It's smart.
You're smart.

759
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:23.869
It's smart.
You should go.

760
00:38:23.869 --> 00:38:25.236
Go.
- Okay.

761
00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:26.204
Be your own hero.

762
00:38:28.674 --> 00:38:30.342
Good luck!

763
00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:37.383
- Row in!
- Come on. Charlie!

764
00:38:39.918 --> 00:38:40.852
Come on. Charlie!

765
00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:42.320
You can make it!

766
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.689
Not dead yet!

767
00:38:43.689 --> 00:38:47.092
all: Not dead yet!
Not dead yet!

768
00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:51.563
Not dead yet!
Not dead yet!

769
00:38:51.563 --> 00:38:52.731
There he goes!

770
00:38:54.199 --> 00:38:55.333
Oh!

771
00:38:57.469 --> 00:38:58.637
Oh. shit.

772
00:38:58.637 --> 00:39:00.038
Let's go. baby dolphin!

773
00:39:00.038 --> 00:39:01.440
Right here. right here.
Let's get him.

774
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.341
Give me that. yeah.
- Pull the rig out!

775
00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:04.976
Take it!

776
00:39:04.976 --> 00:39:06.244
Grab it. Charlie!

777
00:39:11.883 --> 00:39:13.385
- Yeah!
- Charlie!

778
00:39:14.786 --> 00:39:16.888
Come on. Charlie!

779
00:39:16.888 --> 00:39:18.790
Out of the water!

780
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:19.991
Let's go. baby!

781
00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:21.560
Get him out of the water!

782
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.828
Come on. baby!

783
00:39:22.828 --> 00:39:24.095
Come on. man!

784
00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:25.764
Come on. baby!
- You got it.

785
00:39:25.764 --> 00:39:26.765
Come up.

786
00:39:26.765 --> 00:39:27.799
Come on.

787
00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:29.635
Oh.

788
00:39:29.635 --> 00:39:30.769
Yeah. boy.

789
00:39:37.409 --> 00:39:38.744
Mabel!

790
00:39:38.744 --> 00:39:40.412
Charlie!

791
00:40:22.654 --> 00:40:24.322
Outward bound.

792
00:40:27.559 --> 00:40:29.360
Godspeed. boys.

793
00:40:32.498 --> 00:40:34.800
Godspeed.

794
00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:26.552
Look. I overslept.
I'm sorry.

795
00:41:26.552 --> 00:41:28.820
Well. if you said
you weren't paying attention.

796
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.189
I'd throw you back
over the side.

797
00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:43.201
Man. the sky and the sea
are the same color.

798
00:41:43.201 --> 00:41:45.036
You can't even see the horizon.

799
00:41:46.471 --> 00:41:48.339
You know
what you also can't see?

800
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:52.210
Whales down there.

801
00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:53.444
Where?

802
00:41:53.444 --> 00:41:54.980
50 feet below us.

803
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.514
Wanna hear 'em?

804
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:59.885
Yeah.

805
00:42:16.434 --> 00:42:17.903
Humpbacks.

806
00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.174
Where is that coming from?

807
00:42:23.174 --> 00:42:25.777
Ray wired up a microphone.

808
00:42:25.777 --> 00:42:29.380
He's a closet whale hugger.

809
00:42:33.084 --> 00:42:35.854
And he's
from down South. right?

810
00:42:35.854 --> 00:42:37.222
Texas.

811
00:42:37.222 --> 00:42:39.958
How did he end up
in Massachusetts?

812
00:42:39.958 --> 00:42:44.562
He had a shrimp boat
out of Galveston.

813
00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:46.031
Hurricane sunk it.

814
00:42:46.031 --> 00:42:50.368
He came up here to New Bedford.

815
00:42:50.368 --> 00:42:53.538
My mom had me.

816
00:42:53.538 --> 00:42:55.106
Never went home.

817
00:43:03.849 --> 00:43:05.183
You should probably turn in.

818
00:43:07.018 --> 00:43:09.487
All right.
I mean. aye. aye. cap'n.

819
00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:31.142
You gonna fuck that thing
when you're done feeling it up?

820
00:43:33.278 --> 00:43:36.815
You got to stow
these things just right.

821
00:43:36.815 --> 00:43:39.050
You get a little bit
of mildew on the seams.

822
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:40.218
it weakens. splits.

823
00:43:40.218 --> 00:43:41.286
It's fucking over.

824
00:43:41.286 --> 00:43:42.520
What the hell is that?

825
00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.255
It's a survival suit. Charlie.

826
00:43:44.255 --> 00:43:46.624
We go down.
I put this bad boy on.

827
00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:48.960
Coast Guard finds me two days
after Skeemo over here

828
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.528
is sleeping with the fishes.

829
00:43:50.528 --> 00:43:52.530
Biggest waste
of money I ever saw.

830
00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:54.265
Boats do sink.
in case you forgot

831
00:43:54.265 --> 00:43:57.035
what happened last Monday.

832
00:43:57.035 --> 00:43:59.805
Well. it's like this. Nunesy.

833
00:43:59.805 --> 00:44:02.507
Sure. you and I are dory mates.

834
00:44:02.507 --> 00:44:04.375
But this ship starts going down

835
00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:06.044
and you march out on the deck
wearing that thing.

836
00:44:06.044 --> 00:44:07.178
what do you think's
gonna happen?

837
00:44:07.178 --> 00:44:08.313
We're gonna pat you
on the back.

838
00:44:08.313 --> 00:44:10.581
say lucky for you?
No.

839
00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:12.250
I'm gonna smack you over
the head with a marlinspike

840
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.618
and take the fucking thing.

841
00:44:13.618 --> 00:44:15.220
And then I gotta fight Charlie
for it.

842
00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.421
And he's a scrappy looking kid.

843
00:44:16.421 --> 00:44:18.523
I'm not looking forward
to that.

844
00:44:20.158 --> 00:44:22.560
You think I didn't think
about that?

845
00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.264
No. I don't think you thought
about that. Nunesy.

846
00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:32.570
The fuck?

847
00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:33.705
Jesus Christ.

848
00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.975
Yeah. yeah.
I'll let him know.

849
00:44:36.975 --> 00:44:38.476
I got six friends here

850
00:44:38.476 --> 00:44:39.878
that say
I'm gonna wear that bad boy

851
00:44:39.878 --> 00:44:42.480
into the deep blue sea.

852
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.415
You don't have any idea
how fucked up

853
00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:45.851
what you just said is. do you?

854
00:44:45.851 --> 00:44:49.354
Well. you're the one talking
about killing me for it.

855
00:44:49.354 --> 00:44:52.123
I'm joking with you.
You bought a gun.

856
00:44:52.123 --> 00:44:53.358
You put it
in your fucking suit.

857
00:44:53.358 --> 00:44:54.459
Are you out of your mind?

858
00:44:54.459 --> 00:44:56.227
You're a sick man.
- Yeah.

859
00:44:56.227 --> 00:44:57.896
Guys.
it's clarified our roles.

860
00:44:57.896 --> 00:44:59.330
It's given us all a goal.

861
00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:00.631
You know. human resources.

862
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:02.400
they'd call it
good team building.

863
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.602
- You see?
- Yeah.

864
00:45:04.602 --> 00:45:06.204
Team building.

865
00:45:06.204 --> 00:45:07.806
- Team building.
- Yeah.

866
00:45:07.806 --> 00:45:08.907
Yeah.

867
00:45:08.907 --> 00:45:09.908
Beautifully phrased bullshit.

868
00:45:09.908 --> 00:45:11.509
Team building.

869
00:45:36.267 --> 00:45:38.203
Scalloping now. King Charles.

870
00:45:38.203 --> 00:45:40.138
We hook up.

871
00:45:40.138 --> 00:45:41.940
Keep your fingers clear
at all times.

872
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:42.908
outside of the hook.

873
00:45:42.908 --> 00:45:44.142
All right.

874
00:45:44.142 --> 00:45:45.276
Back up from it.

875
00:45:49.815 --> 00:45:53.084
Wait till it gets
about halfway.

876
00:45:53.084 --> 00:45:56.187
Walk it back
the way I showed you.

877
00:45:56.187 --> 00:45:57.956
Don't pull on it.
Just walk it back.

878
00:45:57.956 --> 00:45:58.957
All right.

879
00:45:58.957 --> 00:46:02.427
Keep coming.
Keep coming.

880
00:46:02.427 --> 00:46:03.929
Great. Nicely done.

881
00:46:03.929 --> 00:46:06.764
Little Double Dutch swing.

882
00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:08.366
Boom.

883
00:46:24.015 --> 00:46:25.884
Whoa!

884
00:46:25.884 --> 00:46:27.452
Boom.

885
00:46:31.022 --> 00:46:33.791
Whoo!
Yeah.

886
00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:35.160
Come on over.

887
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.164
First thing you do:
pull this guy in.

888
00:46:39.164 --> 00:46:40.231
Pull it out of the bullring.

889
00:46:40.231 --> 00:46:43.268
All right. simple as that.

890
00:46:43.268 --> 00:46:44.769
All right.

891
00:46:44.769 --> 00:46:45.803
Gotta move fast.

892
00:46:45.803 --> 00:46:46.771
Time is money.

893
00:46:46.771 --> 00:46:47.805
Uh-huh.

894
00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:48.840
Dump the dump chain.

895
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.008
Yeah.

896
00:46:50.008 --> 00:46:51.242
Now. back the fuck up.

897
00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:01.652
- Look at that.
- Yeah. I see.

898
00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:02.888
Doubloons.

899
00:47:02.888 --> 00:47:04.622
Yeah. man.

900
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.359
Michelin star dinner
right there.

901
00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:09.861
All right. Charlie boy.

902
00:47:09.861 --> 00:47:11.262
So we wanna get the dredge
on the rail.

903
00:47:11.262 --> 00:47:12.830
So we hook it up
to the lifting chain

904
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.799
right here. okay?

905
00:47:14.799 --> 00:47:16.334
We wanna get
out of this bad boy's way.

906
00:47:16.334 --> 00:47:18.203
Okay.
- Okay.

907
00:47:21.739 --> 00:47:22.707
Whoa!

908
00:47:22.707 --> 00:47:24.275
Whoa. okay.

909
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:33.151
Hit it on the down roll.

910
00:47:33.151 --> 00:47:34.619
The down roll?

911
00:47:47.165 --> 00:47:49.500
All right. now the fun part.

912
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.236
You good at bending over?

913
00:47:51.236 --> 00:47:52.470
You're gonna get
a lot of practice.

914
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:54.005
Come on.

915
00:47:54.005 --> 00:47:55.206
Come on. baby.

916
00:47:55.206 --> 00:47:56.707
Let's get in here.

917
00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:57.775
All right!

918
00:47:57.775 --> 00:47:59.077
Let's get mad. boys!

919
00:47:59.077 --> 00:48:01.346
Assholes and elbows. come on!

920
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:06.817
All right. Charlie.

921
00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:08.186
I'm gonna explain this
one time.

922
00:48:08.186 --> 00:48:09.554
Right side up.
- Yeah.

923
00:48:09.554 --> 00:48:11.289
You wanna get in there
nice and slow.

924
00:48:11.289 --> 00:48:13.558
Turn the knife upward
and scrape the meat.

925
00:48:13.558 --> 00:48:15.193
Yep.
Damn. that opened that.

926
00:48:15.193 --> 00:48:17.328
Have fun.

927
00:48:17.328 --> 00:48:18.529
It should all
just come right off.

928
00:48:18.529 --> 00:48:20.265
- There you go.
- Hey!

929
00:48:20.265 --> 00:48:21.699
- Yeah. baby.
- Yeah!

930
00:48:21.699 --> 00:48:23.034
There you go.
You're a natural.

931
00:48:23.034 --> 00:48:24.035
Man. that was perfect!

932
00:48:24.035 --> 00:48:25.203
You see that?

933
00:48:25.203 --> 00:48:27.105
That's beautiful. yeah.

934
00:48:27.105 --> 00:48:28.539
You got to find that rhythm.

935
00:48:28.539 --> 00:48:30.041
What. you gotta dance
while you--

936
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:31.442
Find that chakra that--
yeah. you do a shuck dance.

937
00:48:31.442 --> 00:48:32.710
It helps you out.

938
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:33.979
Man. I can't
even put the knife in

939
00:48:33.979 --> 00:48:35.446
when dancing like this.

940
00:48:35.446 --> 00:48:36.814
I got a lot of natural rhythm
anyway. you know?

941
00:48:36.814 --> 00:48:38.549
You should see him
practicing salsa.

942
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:40.651
Let's find a big scallop.

943
00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:41.886
Big one's a different story.

944
00:48:41.886 --> 00:48:43.388
You got to flip
your knife around. right?

945
00:48:43.388 --> 00:48:44.855
Hold that.
Flip your knife around.

946
00:48:44.855 --> 00:48:46.391
Right.
You got to hit it hard.

947
00:48:46.391 --> 00:48:47.993
Knock it out.
- He didn't do that.

948
00:48:47.993 --> 00:48:49.627
You got to knock it.
The big ones are conscious.

949
00:48:49.627 --> 00:48:51.029
You got to knock it out.
Hit it harder.

950
00:48:51.029 --> 00:48:53.431
You got to--knock it out!

951
00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:54.899
I'm joking.
You don't got to knock it.

952
00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:02.240
Know what I'm saying?

953
00:49:08.079 --> 00:49:09.480
<i>All right. King Charles.</i>

954
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.216
Now. we wash.

955
00:49:11.649 --> 00:49:13.484
Here's
where you polish them up.

956
00:49:13.484 --> 00:49:15.420
You get them looking
nice and sparkling clean.

957
00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.755
Oh. yeah.

958
00:49:17.755 --> 00:49:19.290
Grab one
of those muslin bags

959
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:21.226
like I showed you.

960
00:49:21.226 --> 00:49:22.293
Hold it open.

961
00:49:22.293 --> 00:49:24.329
There you go.

962
00:49:24.329 --> 00:49:26.864
You got a bag of gold.

963
00:49:26.864 --> 00:49:28.233
Yeah.

964
00:49:30.001 --> 00:49:31.869
You enjoying yourself?

965
00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:33.638
Yes. sir!

966
00:49:33.638 --> 00:49:36.474
Fat baby.

967
00:49:36.474 --> 00:49:38.443
Hey. grab that shovel. Charlie.

968
00:49:38.443 --> 00:49:42.813
I got it.

969
00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:44.349
Just sprinkle
a little bit on top.

970
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:46.317
Give it a little bit of love.

971
00:49:46.317 --> 00:49:47.585
- Like that?
- Like that.

972
00:49:47.585 --> 00:49:49.487
That's perfect.

973
00:49:49.487 --> 00:49:51.056
That's good.
That's good.

974
00:49:53.058 --> 00:49:54.792
Huh. huh?

975
00:49:54.792 --> 00:49:56.727
Not too bad.

976
00:49:57.928 --> 00:50:00.065
You almost looking
like a fisherman.

977
00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:30.161
What's up. fuckhead?

978
00:50:30.161 --> 00:50:32.263
How we doing?

979
00:50:32.263 --> 00:50:36.067
Six bushels a side. 20-count.

980
00:50:36.067 --> 00:50:39.003
Nice.

981
00:50:39.003 --> 00:50:40.605
Not nice enough.

982
00:50:40.605 --> 00:50:42.440
We're moving north.

983
00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.629
Hey. Tom. we're all cut out.

984
00:51:04.629 --> 00:51:07.765
The guys wanna know
when we're setting out again.

985
00:51:07.765 --> 00:51:09.467
See that line of boats?

986
00:51:09.467 --> 00:51:11.969
Those are
American fishing boats.

987
00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:13.471
Uh-huh.

988
00:51:13.471 --> 00:51:15.773
And that is
a Canadian Coast Guard

989
00:51:15.773 --> 00:51:18.209
moving away from us
about 11 miles.

990
00:51:18.209 --> 00:51:21.112
And as soon as they disappear.
we're going in.

991
00:51:22.547 --> 00:51:24.215
Going in where?

992
00:51:24.215 --> 00:51:27.518
Canadian waters.

993
00:51:27.518 --> 00:51:29.387
That's Canada on that side.

994
00:51:29.387 --> 00:51:30.821
and there are scallops
along there.

995
00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:32.557
And I remember a spot
from a few years ago.

996
00:51:32.557 --> 00:51:35.393
It could be virgin stuff. U10s.

997
00:51:35.393 --> 00:51:38.062
U10s means money. baby.

998
00:51:38.062 --> 00:51:40.865
So we shut our transponder off
so we can't be located.

999
00:51:40.865 --> 00:51:44.535
dip in. dip out.
turn it back on.

1000
00:51:46.237 --> 00:51:47.838
like nothing happened.

1001
00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:51.776
Yeah. we're gonna show Ray
what real fishermen can do.

1002
00:51:51.776 --> 00:51:53.578
The biggest trip
the "Finestkind's" had

1003
00:51:53.578 --> 00:51:55.613
in five years is gonna be mine.

1004
00:51:55.613 --> 00:51:57.315
We're gonna shove
the boat share

1005
00:51:57.315 --> 00:51:58.416
so far up his nose.

1006
00:51:58.416 --> 00:52:00.084
it's gonna come out his ears.

1007
00:52:02.587 --> 00:52:04.121
What happens
if we get caught?

1008
00:52:06.591 --> 00:52:08.393
Getting caught
is not an option.

1009
00:52:08.393 --> 00:52:10.661
Whew.
Say that again.

1010
00:52:10.661 --> 00:52:14.765
Getting caught is
not a fucking option.

Oh. fuck.

1056
00:55:18.783 --> 00:55:20.651

1057

- Charlie.
- Get the fuck off.

1058
00:55:23.688 --> 00:55:25.189
Fuck you.
Ah!

1059
00:55:30.495 --> 00:55:32.763
Whoo!

1060
00:56:17.508 --> 00:56:18.743
There it is. baby.

1061
00:56:18.743 --> 00:56:20.911
Whoo!

1062
00:56:32.289 --> 00:56:33.791
Fuck.

1063
00:56:34.492 --> 00:56:35.726
Fuck.

1064
00:56:35.726 --> 00:56:37.528
- Fuck.
- Here. I got you.

1065
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.302
What was that?

1066
00:56:47.605 --> 00:56:49.039
We're hung up.

1067
00:56:49.039 --> 00:56:52.042
But look--no peaks.
no edges. nothing.

1068
00:56:55.112 --> 00:56:57.114
Let me try
and work her loose.

1069
00:56:58.716 --> 00:57:00.918
Come on.
Come on. baby.

1070
00:57:16.834 --> 00:57:17.802
Give it some juice!

1071
00:57:17.802 --> 00:57:18.836
Yeah.

1072
00:57:18.836 --> 00:57:20.204
Come on. come on.

1073
00:57:20.204 --> 00:57:21.806
Come on. come on.
come on. come on.

1074
00:57:33.918 --> 00:57:35.385
Son of a bitch.

1075
00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:36.887
Support dredge is stuck.

1076
00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:40.991
Gonna haul back
the starboard side.

1077
00:57:45.596 --> 00:57:48.966
Oh. shit.
Canadians coming.

1078
00:57:50.234 --> 00:57:52.036
How much time?

1079
00:57:52.036 --> 00:57:54.038
Six minutes.

1080
00:57:54.038 --> 00:57:55.606
Then we got to cut loose.

1081
00:57:58.142 --> 00:57:59.810
Fuck. that's not a boat.

1082
00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:02.547
Tom. that's not a boat.

1083
00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:11.589
We got killer tomatoes
on the way.

1084
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:13.824
What are killer tomatoes?

1085
00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:16.561
Canadian Coast Guard.
'cause they're painted red.

1086
00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:38.048
Oh. shit.

1087
00:58:41.752 --> 00:58:43.187
Oh!

1088
00:58:57.702 --> 00:58:59.704
How close are we to the line?

1089
00:58:59.704 --> 00:59:00.738
Not close enough.

1090
00:59:00.738 --> 00:59:02.907
We are fucked.

1091
00:59:04.809 --> 00:59:05.943
Fuck you!

1092
00:59:40.645 --> 00:59:42.980
How soon till we know
if we're in trouble or not?

1093
00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:44.514
It depends.

1094
00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:48.485
Canadians might be just
happy to chase us off.

1095
00:59:48.485 --> 00:59:50.755
Right now. we're just
another boat coming home

1096
00:59:50.755 --> 00:59:54.424
'cause we lost a dredge.

1097
00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:56.927
Yeah. go tell the boys
to get back on the lines.

1098
00:59:56.927 --> 00:59:58.262
All right.

1099
01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.500
Silver lining is.
lucky you.

1100
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.803
you get a second shot
at Mabel "Black Label"

1101
01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:07.137
earlier than expected.

1102
01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:08.605
Yeah. I don't--

1103
01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.040
I don't really know
what to do about that.

1104
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.676
She's great and everything.

1105
01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:13.043
I just feel like

1106
01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:15.079
with everything
that's been going on with Tom

1107
01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:16.747
and--and I just--

1108
01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:20.084
You're
overthinking it. brother.

1109
01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:21.518
Just take it easy.

1110
01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:25.455
Fuck!

1111
01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:30.961
Haul this to the state pier.
I'll serve the papers there!

1112
01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.663
Your vessel's been seized!

1113
01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:34.164
You know why I fish?

1114
01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:36.767
Because when I'm out at sea.

1115
01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:40.738
every asshole in my fucking
life disappears

1116
01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:42.406
from the break on down!

1117
01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:44.942
And you fucking clowns
can suck my--

1118
01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:47.544
Fuck you!

1119
01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:54.184
<i>What do you think
about fishing now?</i>

1120
01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:58.856
I'd go back out
in a heartbeat.

1121
01:00:58.856 --> 01:01:00.290
Finest kind.

1122
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.693
Get that word
out of your mouth.

1123
01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:04.962
This isn't your life.
It's my life.

1124
01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:06.630
You're just a fucking tourist.

1125
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:15.539
No. do--don't get
me wrong. Charlie.

1126
01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:17.207
I mean. you're a hell of a kid.

1127
01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:19.176
You--
I mean. you could be

1128
01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:22.279
in some air-conditioned office
with your father.

1129
01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:25.750
but you're out
humping it with us.

1130
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:29.419
You know. always thought
you were a hell of a kid.

1131
01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:34.658
What's gonna happen
to the boat?

1132
01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:36.827
We pray to God
they don't take the license.

1133
01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:41.799
Mr. White will probably
fucking end up with her.

1134
01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:50.407
You stay here.

1135
01:01:52.576 --> 01:01:55.345
Hey. Tom?

1136
01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.247
Tom. I'm gonna get you
through this.

1137
01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:19.503
Mr. Eldridge isn't home.

1138
01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:24.141
Where is he?

1139
01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:26.143
Who are you?

1140
01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:27.677
That tells a story
right there.

1141
01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:29.346
I'm his son.

1142
01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:30.848
Ray's in Boston.

1143
01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.883
What's he doing in Boston?

1144
01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:37.021
<i>Call for Dr. Sattler.</i>

1145
01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:39.289
<i>Call for Dr. Lorene Sattler.</i>

1146
01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:43.727
Hey. Pop.

1147
01:02:43.727 --> 01:02:45.930
- Hey.
- Hey.

1148
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:48.132
What are you doing here?

1149
01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:50.868
How did you know I was here?

1150
01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:52.803
Your neighbor.

1151
01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:57.441
Yeah.

1152
01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.009
Is that you. Charlie?

1153
01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:00.044
Mr. Eldridge.
good to see you.

1154
01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:03.513
Yeah. Charlie's been fishing
with us. uh. this summer.

1155
01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:06.750
Oh. good.
Brothers ought to be brothers.

1156
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.985
How's your mom doing?

1157
01:03:07.985 --> 01:03:09.453
She's good.
Thank you.

1158
01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:10.855
You're not in the hospital
because you ate

1159
01:03:10.855 --> 01:03:12.289
some of her meatloaf. are you?

1160
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:13.958
She's been making
that a long time. huh?

1161
01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:17.127
What's going on?

1162
01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.929
Why are you here?

1163
01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:24.368
I got cancer.

1164
01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:25.702
In my stomach.

1165
01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.440
Same thing that killed my dad.

1166
01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.110
and I'm going out
just like he did.

1167
01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.378
I mean--

1168
01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.283
What can we do?

1169
01:03:39.283 --> 01:03:41.051
What--what are they gonna do?
What--what are they doing?

1170
01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:43.120
Nothing.

1171
01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.288
It's too late.

1172
01:03:44.288 --> 01:03:47.457
I waited too long.

1173
01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:48.926
I thought it was a ulcer.

1174
01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:54.198
At least I can stop eating
them goddamn Tums now.

1175
01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:00.237
They were in here
about an hour ago

1176
01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:02.106
wanting to talk about hospices.

1177
01:04:02.106 --> 01:04:03.440
I told them to fuck off.

1178
01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.841
I'm going fishing.

1179
01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:10.214
That boat's my hospice.

1180
01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:13.717
What are you guys doing here?

1181
01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:15.519
You're supposed to be
out to sea.

1182
01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.925
Uh. we were fishing the line.

1183
01:04:20.925 --> 01:04:23.327
Uh. dredge got caught up.

1184
01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:26.663
Canadian spotter plane got us.

1185
01:04:26.663 --> 01:04:28.198
Boat's impounded.

1186
01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.799
What in the goddamn hell

1187
01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.535
are you doing
in Canadian waters?

1188
01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:33.938
Where's the boat at now?

1189
01:04:33.938 --> 01:04:36.073
- New Bedford.
- Shit.

1190
01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:37.374
I never should
have trusted you.

1191
01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:39.343
I do not understand
the way you're built.

1192
01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:40.677
You built me!

1193
01:04:40.677 --> 01:04:42.112
I did not.

1194
01:04:42.112 --> 01:04:44.248
You can't work with people.

1195
01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:45.849
You can't get along.

1196
01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:47.151
You have no allegiance.

1197
01:04:47.151 --> 01:04:49.486
You have no commitment
to anybody but yourself.

1198
01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:52.356
Mr. Eldridge.
with--with all due respect.

1199
01:04:52.356 --> 01:04:53.958
that's not true.
You're wrong.

1200
01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:08.405
It's incredible. shit they
make you wear in this joint.

1201
01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:12.676
You got a knife on you?

1202
01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:23.720
Can you boys help me
get out of here?

1203
01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:33.497
Is that my shirt
you're wearing?

1204
01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:35.966
Uh. I don't know.

1205
01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:37.434
I found it on the boat.

1206
01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.436
What's your dad think
about you fishing. Charlie?

1207
01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:44.141
Uh. honestly.
Mr. Eldridge. not much.

1208
01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:45.442
Smart man.

1209
01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:52.616
It's not your fault. Tom.

1210
01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.384
I've been chased
off the line many times.

1211
01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:56.020
That could have been me.

1212
01:05:59.189 --> 01:06:02.926
Just plain old dumb. bad luck.

1213
01:06:05.595 --> 01:06:09.266
It seems to be running
in the family here lately.

1214
01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:10.900
I'll get your boat back.
I promise.

1215
01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.303
No. you're gonna get
your boat back.

1216
01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:16.073
- My boat?
- Yeah.

1217
01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:19.709
I die. you get the boat

1218
01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:23.380
and all the headaches
that go with it.

1219
01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:25.882
I don't want it.

1220
01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:30.754
I don't want it.

1221
01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:33.823
Uh. maybe
if we worked it together

1222
01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:35.992
or I had gone mate for you.
but. you know.

1223
01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.028
I got nothing to do with it.
Give it to your crew.

1224
01:06:38.028 --> 01:06:39.929
I mean. give it
to fucking Charlie.

1225
01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:41.698
I--I don't want the boat.

1226
01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:47.271
You want my boat. Charlie?

1227
01:06:47.271 --> 01:06:48.705
No. sir.

1228
01:06:50.707 --> 01:06:51.908
Sorry. Mr. Eldridge.

1229
01:06:51.908 --> 01:06:53.243
I don't wanna get
in the middle of this.

1230
01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:55.279
- Mm.
- You guys need to talk.

1231
01:06:55.279 --> 01:06:56.513
No.

1232
01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:00.417
Tom won't change.

1233
01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:03.653
I can't change.

1234
01:07:03.653 --> 01:07:06.956
Let that be a lesson
to you. Charlie.

1235
01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:09.693
You live.
You die.

1236
01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:12.062
It's the in-between
that counts.

1237
01:07:19.103 --> 01:07:21.105
Finest kind.

1238
01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:39.789
So then you knock
the dredge out on the roll.

1239
01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:43.560
or else it'll flip.
and then it'll come up empty.

1240
01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.596
And then we tow them back.

1241
01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:49.299
And then you have.
like. 12 minutes

1242
01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:52.769
if we're in rocky bottoms.
like. maybe 20 if it's soft.

1243
01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:54.271
What do you mean by soft?

1244
01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:56.340
- He means sand.
- Oh.

1245
01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.674
Right. so then
we haul them back.

1246
01:07:57.674 --> 01:08:00.344
Wait. h--haul what back?

1247
01:08:00.344 --> 01:08:01.711
The dredges.

1248
01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:04.381
So do you hook up
or run the winch?

1249
01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:05.815
I hook up
because I'm the shacker.

1250
01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:08.752
But Skeemo and Nunesy.
they run the winch.

1251
01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:12.656
Well. I might not know
about hooking up or--

1252
01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:15.859
or hauling in. but Shacker.
Nunesy. and Skeemo

1253
01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:18.528
sounds like...
A law firm.

1254
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:25.735
So... how long before this
is out of your system?

1255
01:08:25.735 --> 01:08:28.071
- Gary.

1256
01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:30.540
Don't "Gary" me. Donna.
I'm just asking.

1257
01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:38.515
I'm thinking of fishing
for a year.

1258
01:08:38.515 --> 01:08:40.284
you know. deferring law school.

1259
01:08:40.284 --> 01:08:43.187
D--don't screw
around. Charlie.

1260
01:08:43.187 --> 01:08:46.089
This is Boston University Law.

1261
01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:48.658
It'll open doors for you
the rest of your life.

1262
01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:49.626
I don't want doors
opened for me.

1263
01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:50.860
I want my own thing.

1264
01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:54.664
You--you want
what you think Tom has.

1265
01:08:54.664 --> 01:08:56.400
but you're gonna find out
he's got shit.

1266
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.435
Stop idolizing him.

1267
01:08:58.435 --> 01:09:00.069
You're better than he is.

1268
01:09:01.605 --> 01:09:03.507
No offense.

1269
01:09:03.507 --> 01:09:05.275
I'm just thinking about it!

1270
01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:13.149
He's disappointed.

1271
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:17.754
You surprised him.

1272
01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:19.589
Honey. please take this slow.

1273
01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:21.191
Mom. there's something else.

1274
01:09:22.659 --> 01:09:24.561
Mr. Eldridge has cancer.

1275
01:09:24.561 --> 01:09:26.396
What?

1276
01:09:26.396 --> 01:09:29.366
Ray?

1277
01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:32.869
Me and Tom drove him home
from Mass General.

1278
01:09:32.869 --> 01:09:34.904
Well. Mr. Eldridge told Tom

1279
01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:36.740
that he wanted him to have
the boat.

1280
01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.075
and Tom said no.
and then they just fought.

1281
01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:46.650
It's that bad. huh?

1282
01:09:49.253 --> 01:09:51.421
Ray's giving up the boat.

1283
01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:53.323
Mom. him and Tom.

1284
01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:55.058
they've got to find a way
to figure things out.

1285
01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:57.126
because if--
- Some girl for you

1286
01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:59.329
named. uh. Mabel.

1287
01:10:08.238 --> 01:10:10.274
I didn't think
they named girls Mabel anymore.

1288
01:10:13.009 --> 01:10:14.043
Hey.

1289
01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.612
I heard you were home.
white boy.

1290
01:10:15.612 --> 01:10:17.947
Yeah.

1291
01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:19.583
<i>Who told you. Skeemo?</i>

1292
01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:21.685
Uh-huh.

1293
01:10:21.685 --> 01:10:23.553
<i>I'm trying to see you.</i>

1294
01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.755
Were you gonna ghost me?

1295
01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.857
Look. I--I don't even have
your number.

1296
01:10:27.857 --> 01:10:28.892
You could have
called someone.

1297
01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.628
You have resources.

1298
01:10:31.628 --> 01:10:33.463
Look. I have been thinking
about everything

1299
01:10:33.463 --> 01:10:34.631
<i>that's been going on with--</i>

1300
01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:35.799
Do you got
a girlfriend. Charlie?

1301
01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:41.371
Not right now.

1302
01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:43.940
I mean. not--not steady.

1303
01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.709
Well. do you want one
or don't you?

1304
01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:50.146
Maybe.

1305
01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:52.582
Well. you better decide.
Mr. Maybe.

1306
01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:53.950
because I am parked outside

1307
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:57.053
of your big. expensive
Padanaram mansion.

1308
01:10:57.053 --> 01:10:58.822
<i>You got fucking horses
back there?</i>

1309
01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:05.061
<i>And I need advice filling out
my community college apps.</i>

1310
01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:17.807
We have to write an essay
for the application.

1311
01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:24.147
You should probably write it
about how good you kiss.

1312
01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:26.215
You know I've actually only
ever written an essay once?

1313
01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:29.252
- Yeah?
- Yeah. senior year. Moby Dick.

1314
01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:34.257
Um. maybe we should leave
Herman Melville out of this.

1315
01:11:34.257 --> 01:11:36.460
You know. I tried to read it.
but I quit 200 pages in.

1316
01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.061
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1317
01:11:38.061 --> 01:11:40.664
Um...

1318
01:11:40.664 --> 01:11:42.932
I couldn't relate.

1319
01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:46.302
My essay was "too many
damn dudes on that boat."

1320
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.504
I hear that.

1321
01:11:51.575 --> 01:11:54.678
So?

1322
01:11:54.678 --> 01:11:55.812
What?

1323
01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.213
What's gonna be my essay?

1324
01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.857
What about
if you make it personal?

1325
01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:09.693
You know.
what makes you scared.

1326
01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:11.294
what makes you happy.

1327
01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:18.568
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1328
01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.904
Yeah.

1329
01:12:20.904 --> 01:12:23.306
It was a great crew
while it lasted.

1330
01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:26.142
Hey. we don't know
it's over yet.

1331
01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:28.478
Didn't tell my wife
I'm unemployed yet.

1332
01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:34.884
Yo. what happened?

1333
01:12:34.884 --> 01:12:37.921
$100.000 fine.
catch forfeited.

1334
01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:40.256
said Ray's lucky to keep
his fucking license.

1335
01:12:40.256 --> 01:12:42.091
Shit.

1336
01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.427
I thought it was
just supposed to be

1337
01:12:43.427 --> 01:12:46.062
a--a preliminary hearing.

1338
01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:47.363
Well. their minds
were made up.

1339
01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.432
Why see me twice?

1340
01:12:48.432 --> 01:12:49.866
Especially in that suit.

1341
01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.668
I would fine you
a million fuck dollars.

1342
01:12:53.503 --> 01:12:54.538
Easy for you to laugh.

1343
01:12:54.538 --> 01:12:55.672
You got everything.

1344
01:12:55.672 --> 01:12:58.274
Yeah. you're right.

1345
01:12:58.274 --> 01:13:01.144
I got everything.
including you.

1346
01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.349
Face only a mother
could love.

1347
01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:12.355
Yeah. son of a bitch
said I could send it out

1348
01:13:12.355 --> 01:13:13.690
as my Christmas card.

1349
01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:14.891
Yeah.

1350
01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:16.125
Ah. shit.

1351
01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:18.261
How are we gonna make $100.000?

1352
01:13:19.429 --> 01:13:21.030
Well. Ray's house
is against it.

1353
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.599
so we're fucked at the bank.

1354
01:13:22.599 --> 01:13:24.033
We can't fish it up
because the boat's impounded

1355
01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:25.469
until the fine's paid.

1356
01:13:32.642 --> 01:13:36.480
But goddamn if I'm gonna lose
my father's boat.

1357
01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.215
I--I still don't see
what's in it for me.

1358
01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:42.118
You lend us the money.

1359
01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:44.187
You--you pay the fine.

1360
01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:47.957
We'll fish exclusively
for Excelsior

1361
01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:51.027
until you recoup your 100
plus another 50.

1362
01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:54.698
50% return on my dollar.

1363
01:13:54.698 --> 01:13:56.933
Yeah.

1364
01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:59.002
I wish life were that simple.

1365
01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:11.848
I can't let my father die
with his boat tied up.

1366
01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:17.120
Name your terms.
and you got a deal.

1367
01:14:23.527 --> 01:14:27.531
The "Finestkind"
is a highliner.

1368
01:14:27.531 --> 01:14:32.235
Ray Eldridge running it
would be a great investment.

1369
01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:34.638
but you...

1370
01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:39.843
No.

1371
01:14:39.843 --> 01:14:44.280
And. uh.

1372
01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:48.017

you're feelin' right now. Tom?

1373
01:14:48.017 --> 01:14:49.853

1390
01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:54.684

Rocky. you got a good. cold

Chardonnay or a Pinot Grigio?

1395

- Chardonnay.
- Yeah.

1396
01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:18.007
- In a paper cup.
- In a paper cup.

1397
01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:23.613

ever do this to me.

01:16:23.613 --> 01:16:24.981
What?

1399
01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:29.585
Make me laugh and make me cry
at the same time.

1400
01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:30.620
Does it hurt?

1401
01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.288
I can handle it.

1402
01:16:32.288 --> 01:16:34.523
That's not what I asked.

1403
01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.625

You put Tom in this world.

1409
01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:52.441
You can't leave
without saying goodbye.

1410
01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:54.577
Me and Tom said goodbye
a long time ago.

1411
01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:57.413

1423
01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.220
I'll go to Walpole.

1424
01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.422
lift some weights.
do some time.

1425
01:17:39.422 --> 01:17:41.825

ten miles offshore.

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:49.665
pick up a drop.

1429
01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:50.967
deliver it back onshore.

1430
01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:52.301
Done.

1431
01:17:52.301 --> 01:17:54.170

a hundred-grand delivery fee.

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:57.273
that we were dealt. man.

1434
01:17:57.273 --> 01:17:58.674
Fuck the cards.

1435
01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.477
- Fuck the cards.
- Yeah. fucking fuck the cards.

1436
01:18:01.477 --> 01:18:03.713
We deal ourselves a new hand.

1437
01:18:11.287 --> 01:18:13.489
What do I tell Charlie?

1438
01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.059
Ooh. tell Charlie?

1439
01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:17.193
Yeah. he's part of the crew.

1440
01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:18.527
He's got a right to know.

1441
01:18:20.563 --> 01:18:25.268
Yo. Charlie's the one
who set this up.

1442
01:18:31.908 --> 01:18:33.476
Sorry we're late.

1443
01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:39.082
You found these drug guys?

1444
01:18:39.082 --> 01:18:41.550
You brokered the deal?

1445
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.152
Yeah.

1446
01:18:43.152 --> 01:18:45.154
My mom knows them.

1447
01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:46.522
Yeah. she says it's cool.

1448
01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:49.225
Oh. your girlfriend's
convicted felon.

1449
01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:50.794
drug-dealing mother says
it's cool.

1450
01:18:50.794 --> 01:18:54.530
I feel so much better now.

1451
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:55.899
Listen. if you're
not interested.

1452
01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:57.834
they're just gonna find
somebody else who is.

1453
01:18:57.834 --> 01:18:58.902
Was that a threat?

1454
01:18:58.902 --> 01:19:00.369
No.

1455
01:19:00.369 --> 01:19:01.737
I'm just saying
they wanna do business.

1456
01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:03.239
So whether that's
with us or whoever.

1457
01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:04.740
it really doesn't matter.

1458
01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:20.957
How does it work?

1459
01:19:20.957 --> 01:19:22.826
They wanna meet
at Supreme Donuts in an hour.

1460
01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:31.400
There you go.

1461
01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.236
Marky. I asked for a cruller.

1462
01:19:33.236 --> 01:19:34.670
Does look a cruller to you?

1463
01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:37.340
Ah. here we go.
There they are.

1464
01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.707
Yeah. get this out of here.

1465
01:19:45.949 --> 01:19:47.917
What is this. Mabel.
a fucking convention?

1466
01:19:49.252 --> 01:19:50.786
This is Tom.

1467
01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.255
He's the captain.

1468
01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:55.791
Hi. Tom.

1469
01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.626
I'm Weeks.

1470
01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:58.928
Pull up a chair.

1471
01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:06.035
Everybody. sit down.

1472
01:20:06.035 --> 01:20:07.236
Relax.

1473
01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:10.173
Would you like some coffee?

1474
01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:14.310
Yeah. I'll take
a black. no sugar.

1475
01:20:16.712 --> 01:20:18.381
Counter's over there. motherfucker.

1476
01:20:20.884 --> 01:20:22.919
Hey.

1477
01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:24.854
He's with you guys?

1478
01:20:24.854 --> 01:20:26.089
Yeah.

1479
01:20:26.089 --> 01:20:27.123
He just thinks he's better
than us.

1480
01:20:27.123 --> 01:20:29.558
so he sits by himself.

1481
01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:30.826
20 grand.

1482
01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:33.262
Another 80 when you
hand over my stock.

1483
01:20:36.866 --> 01:20:38.834
You know. Mabel here says
you guys are one-timing.

1484
01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:43.306
but if this works out...

1485
01:20:43.306 --> 01:20:46.109
No. this is it.
One time only.

1486
01:20:46.109 --> 01:20:47.576
Short on cash?

1487
01:20:54.017 --> 01:20:56.219
Mabel here. she has
all the. uh. times.

1488
01:20:56.219 --> 01:20:58.387
addresses. you know.
attitude and longitude--

1489
01:20:58.387 --> 01:20:59.788
all that bullshit.

1490
01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:01.257
We was gonna write it
on her panties.

1491
01:21:01.257 --> 01:21:02.658
but it turns out
she's not wearing any.

1492
01:21:04.427 --> 01:21:07.030
Ha-ha.
There you are.

1493
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:10.366
All right. so you're the one
with his brain in his dick.

1494
01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:12.435
You I don't think I like.

1495
01:21:12.435 --> 01:21:16.472
And you. you're a dumbass.

1496
01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:21.677
You. I've seen
those eyes before.

1497
01:21:23.779 --> 01:21:26.950
Those are the eyes that keep
people like me in business.

1498
01:21:28.784 --> 01:21:30.619
And you're
the righteously pissed off one.

1499
01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:33.289
You I can deal with.
even if you are fucking mute.

1500
01:21:33.289 --> 01:21:35.024
All right. guys. don't fuck up.

1501
01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:36.892
No second chances.

1502
01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.327
Your mom's got my number.

1503
01:21:40.529 --> 01:21:42.999
I expect to see you
promptly after the fact.

1504
01:21:47.203 --> 01:21:50.473
<i>Sure your brother-in-law's
okay with this?</i>

1505
01:21:50.473 --> 01:21:52.708
<i>Yeah. he owes me a favor.</i>

1506
01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:53.977
A big one.

1507
01:21:57.346 --> 01:21:59.648
Let's take her
to the ice house.

1508
01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.784
What do we need ice for?

1509
01:22:01.784 --> 01:22:03.919
Make a couple of tows.

1510
01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:06.322
have some fish in the hole
if the Coast Guard boards us.

1511
01:22:06.322 --> 01:22:09.825
wanna know
why we're out there empty.

1512
01:22:09.825 --> 01:22:13.562
See. that's why you're
the captain. right?

1513
01:22:13.562 --> 01:22:15.764
All right. boys. let's go.

1514
01:22:22.371 --> 01:22:23.839
What?

1515
01:22:23.839 --> 01:22:25.774
Just so you know.
Charlie. this is it.

1516
01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:28.377
After this.
we go separate ways.

1517
01:22:31.147 --> 01:22:32.681
What are you talking about?

1518
01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:33.983
Don't start this shit again.

1519
01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:35.951
You can turn in any time.

1520
01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:37.320
No. I'm not turning in.

1521
01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.787
I'm not going anywhere.
This is my deal.

1522
01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.789
It was my idea.
I set the whole thing up.

1523
01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:43.426
Do you know what line
you're crossing right now?

1524
01:22:43.426 --> 01:22:45.995
What--what line
I'm crossing?

1525
01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:47.530
Did you know what line
you were crossing

1526
01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:50.099
when you went into Canada?

1527
01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:52.268
Huh?
You crossed a line

1528
01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:54.437
to say "fuck you"
to your father. right?

1529
01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:57.840
And I crossed a line
to help you.

1530
01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.608
Oh!

1531
01:22:59.608 --> 01:23:01.177
Get up
on that fucking bowline.

1532
01:23:21.297 --> 01:23:22.998
That's him.
That's him.

1533
01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:57.633
Let's get after it.

1534
01:23:57.633 --> 01:23:59.135
- We leave it.
- We can't do that.

1535
01:23:59.135 --> 01:24:00.603
- We fucking leave it.
- We can't do that.

1536
01:24:00.603 --> 01:24:02.071
We're leaving it there!

1537
01:24:02.071 --> 01:24:03.772
They're gonna think
we ripped them off!

1538
01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.474
I'm gonna turn it back around.

1539
01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.788
Fuck.

1540
01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:32.401
You live.
You die.

1541
01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:33.769
It's the in-between
that counts.

1542
01:24:33.769 --> 01:24:35.604
Ray Eldridge said so. right?

1543
01:24:35.604 --> 01:24:37.306
Hey. this gets his boat back.

1544
01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:38.907
He dies knowing it's okay.

1545
01:24:51.454 --> 01:24:53.122
Yeah.

1546
01:24:56.225 --> 01:24:59.362
Yeah. we got it.

1547
01:24:59.362 --> 01:25:00.763
All right.

1548
01:25:02.698 --> 01:25:03.999
They wanna meet
at the parking lot

1549
01:25:03.999 --> 01:25:06.735
of the Supreme Donuts
in 10 minutes.

1550
01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:09.172
But they only want
two of us there.

1551
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.176
Shotgun.

1552
01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:23.219
Tom!

1553
01:25:27.156 --> 01:25:28.657
Tom. I'm coming with.

1554
01:25:35.331 --> 01:25:36.732
Get out.

1555
01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:39.402
What?

1556
01:25:39.402 --> 01:25:40.869
Get out.

1557
01:25:42.305 --> 01:25:43.539
It's the way it's gotta be.

1558
01:25:43.539 --> 01:25:45.040
It's me and Charlie
till the wheels come off.

1559
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.275
Get out.

1560
01:26:03.626 --> 01:26:04.993
<i>Get the cashier's check.</i>

1561
01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.229
We pay the fine.

1562
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:08.564
Then how long
before we get the boat?

1563
01:26:08.564 --> 01:26:10.866
We'll be fishing in no time.

1564
01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:17.573
What is it?

1565
01:26:17.573 --> 01:26:19.475
What?

1566
01:26:19.475 --> 01:26:20.676
Don't know.

1567
01:26:27.416 --> 01:26:28.851
Shit.
Drugs are mine.

1568
01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:30.386
You don't know about it.
You've never seen 'em.

1569
01:26:30.386 --> 01:26:31.654
Tell me you understand.

1570
01:26:31.654 --> 01:26:32.721
Police!
Hands up!

1571
01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:34.156
Tell me you understand!

1572
01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:35.758
Turn off the car.
Throw the keys out the window.

1573
01:26:35.758 --> 01:26:38.361
- I understand.
- Turn off the car.

1574
01:26:38.361 --> 01:26:40.263
Throw the keys.
Throw!

1575
01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:44.667
Get up.

1576
01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:48.003
Go. on the ground!

1577
01:26:52.408 --> 01:26:54.142
You dumb bastards.

1578
01:26:58.747 --> 01:27:00.115
You're not fucking cops.

1579
01:27:01.284 --> 01:27:03.819
Protect and serve. motherfucker.

1580
01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.289
Let's go.
Let's go.

1581
01:27:18.701 --> 01:27:21.337
No!

1582
01:27:21.337 --> 01:27:24.006
- Oh.
- Are you okay?

1583
01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:26.008
Fuck. he's busted
your fucking head open.

1584
01:27:28.811 --> 01:27:30.078
I gotta get you
to the hospital.

1585
01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.480
- No. uh--
- Hold that.

1586
01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.715
No.

1587
01:27:32.715 --> 01:27:34.883
We gotta--we got--

1588
01:27:34.883 --> 01:27:36.785
we gotta go deal
with those Boston guys.

1589
01:27:36.785 --> 01:27:40.456
They're gonna think
we fucking stole from 'em.

1590
01:27:40.456 --> 01:27:43.326
All right.

1591
01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:52.234
No one's here.

1592
01:27:52.234 --> 01:27:54.703
Counter lady said they took off
a few minutes ago.

1593
01:27:55.938 --> 01:27:59.442
Charlie. we're in trouble.

1594
01:27:59.442 --> 01:28:00.943
The hell are we gonna do?

1595
01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:06.882
They had badges.
they had lights.

1596
01:28:06.882 --> 01:28:09.017
just like undercover cops.

1597
01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:11.554
We went to the doughnut place
to tell Weeks what happened.

1598
01:28:11.554 --> 01:28:13.556
but we were late.

1599
01:28:13.556 --> 01:28:14.857
Already left.

1600
01:28:16.759 --> 01:28:19.662
What if Weeks
sent those guys?

1601
01:28:19.662 --> 01:28:20.829
And why would he do that?

1602
01:28:20.829 --> 01:28:22.097
So he wouldn't
have to pay us.

1603
01:28:22.097 --> 01:28:24.199
No. he--he wouldn't
take a chance

1604
01:28:24.199 --> 01:28:26.034
with real cops
showing up on us.

1605
01:28:32.608 --> 01:28:34.777
What's going on
over there. Rock?

1606
01:28:34.777 --> 01:28:36.178
Don't know.

1607
01:28:36.178 --> 01:28:37.346
Boys were waiting.

1608
01:28:37.346 --> 01:28:38.414
Tom came in beat up.

1609
01:28:46.889 --> 01:28:48.457
What happened?

1610
01:28:48.457 --> 01:28:50.459
Weeks just called my mom
and said you guys didn't show.

1611
01:28:50.459 --> 01:28:52.227
He's crazy mad.

1612
01:28:52.227 --> 01:28:53.362
We got robbed.

1613
01:28:53.362 --> 01:28:54.630
What?

1614
01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:55.864
Who were they?

1615
01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.635
Who's who?

1616
01:28:59.635 --> 01:29:01.704
The guys who jumped us.

1617
01:29:01.704 --> 01:29:03.138
Are you asking me?

1618
01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:05.140
How would I know?
- Tom. don't.

1619
01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:06.274
You set us up.

1620
01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:07.910
Are you fucking
serious right now?

1621
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:09.311
You fucking set us up.
Look at me.

1622
01:29:09.311 --> 01:29:10.513
- I didn't fucking set you up.
- Hey. whoa. whoa!

1623
01:29:10.513 --> 01:29:12.415
Hey!
What the fuck is your problem?

1624
01:29:12.415 --> 01:29:13.816
- Stop! Stop it!
- The fuck is your problem?

1625
01:29:13.816 --> 01:29:14.817
You fucking set us up!

1626
01:29:14.817 --> 01:29:15.951
Fuck you. I did!

1627
01:29:15.951 --> 01:29:17.486
How can you talk shit
like that?

1628
01:29:17.486 --> 01:29:18.821
Charlie. she set us up!

1629
01:29:18.821 --> 01:29:19.955
You don't fucking know me!

1630
01:29:19.955 --> 01:29:21.123
- You fucking set us up!
- Tom!

1631
01:29:21.123 --> 01:29:22.625
Never say some shit
like that again!

1632
01:29:22.625 --> 01:29:24.192
- Come on. get out.
- Get off.

1633
01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.994
Get your fucking hands off me!

1634
01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:31.333
Hey! Hey!
Hey. stop!

1635
01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:32.401
I didn't fucking
set you up. all right?

1636
01:29:32.401 --> 01:29:33.469
Would you stop?

1637
01:29:33.469 --> 01:29:34.403
I didn't set you up!

1638
01:29:34.403 --> 01:29:36.772
Okay!

1639
01:29:36.772 --> 01:29:38.507
- I like you guys.
- Yeah. we like you.

1640
01:29:38.507 --> 01:29:39.942
Yeah. you like me too?

1641
01:29:39.942 --> 01:29:41.577
Why didn't you fucking
like me in there?

1642
01:29:41.577 --> 01:29:42.811
You didn't say shit to Tom!

1643
01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:44.312
You just let him--you--

1644
01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:46.181
I just had to stand there
and fucking take it!

1645
01:29:46.181 --> 01:29:47.616
He's my fucking brother.
What do you want from me?

1646
01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:48.751
- Get the--shut the--
- What am I supposed to do?

1647
01:29:48.751 --> 01:29:50.352
Get the fuck out of my way!

1648
01:29:50.352 --> 01:29:53.422
Mabel. I believe you!

1649
01:29:57.259 --> 01:29:58.461
Fuck!

1650
01:30:00.696 --> 01:30:03.866
I'm good.

1651
01:30:07.369 --> 01:30:10.005
That's fucking priceless.

1652
01:30:10.005 --> 01:30:11.874
What the hell's
going on here. boys?

1653
01:30:11.874 --> 01:30:12.975
N--nothing. Ray.

1654
01:30:12.975 --> 01:30:14.643
Just a misunderstanding.

1655
01:30:14.643 --> 01:30:16.912
Misunderstanding?

1656
01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:18.481
You sure about that?

1657
01:30:18.481 --> 01:30:22.851
Your problems are much bigger
than mine. I guarantee it.

1658
01:30:22.851 --> 01:30:25.488
No offense. Ray. but fuck off.

1659
01:30:25.488 --> 01:30:26.622
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1660
01:30:26.622 --> 01:30:27.656
I'm your fucking son!

1661
01:30:27.656 --> 01:30:29.057
I'm your fucking daddy.

1662
01:30:43.706 --> 01:30:45.207
All right. boys.

1663
01:30:45.207 --> 01:30:47.009
I'm gonna cook you some food.

1664
01:30:47.009 --> 01:30:49.612
and we're gonna talk
some shit out.

1665
01:30:49.612 --> 01:30:52.247
We'll figure this out. okay?

1666
01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:57.085
How you doing?

1667
01:30:57.085 --> 01:30:59.087
Yo. my guy. like. let's--

1668
01:30:59.087 --> 01:31:01.189
let's just take this
outside. okay?

1669
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:02.858
Nah.

1670
01:31:02.858 --> 01:31:04.560
Keep going
where you were going.

1671
01:31:16.505 --> 01:31:18.206
Tony. please.

1672
01:31:25.013 --> 01:31:27.082
She's got nothing
to do with this. man.

1673
01:31:27.082 --> 01:31:28.917
Oh. no. I agree.

1674
01:31:28.917 --> 01:31:30.853
Only thing
I would accuse your wife of

1675
01:31:30.853 --> 01:31:33.255
is making
a wonderful cup of coffee.

1676
01:31:35.724 --> 01:31:37.092
Where's Jamie?

1677
01:31:37.092 --> 01:31:38.493
The living room. watching TV.

1678
01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:41.830
The boy likes Big Bird
just like we used to.

1679
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:43.699
Just get out of my house.

1680
01:31:43.699 --> 01:31:45.333
We'll talk about this outside.

1681
01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:46.635
Nah.

1682
01:31:46.635 --> 01:31:48.470
Kitchen table.

1683
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:51.206
That's where the real
family business gets done.

1684
01:31:51.206 --> 01:31:53.842
Tom.

1685
01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:55.911
Come on.
Sit down.

1686
01:32:05.688 --> 01:32:10.058
So which part
of "promptly after the fact"

1687
01:32:10.058 --> 01:32:13.128
did you have trouble
understanding?

1688
01:32:13.128 --> 01:32:15.731
Because you fellas got
something of mine. right?

1689
01:32:15.731 --> 01:32:18.233
Ah--

1690
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:22.571
Oh. yeah. that's a problem
we've been having.

1691
01:32:22.571 --> 01:32:24.840
How far apart
are the pains now. Marky?

1692
01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:25.941
Just breathe.

1693
01:32:25.941 --> 01:32:27.375
About three minutes.

1694
01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:30.145
Now. the quicker you fellas
help me with my problem.

1695
01:32:30.145 --> 01:32:31.947
the sooner
you can handle your own.

1696
01:32:31.947 --> 01:32:33.849
Deal's a deal. cap. all right?

1697
01:32:33.849 --> 01:32:36.484
Big fish eats little fish.

1698
01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:39.154
Where's my heroin?

1699
01:32:39.154 --> 01:32:42.290
You should ask
your girl. Mabel.

1700
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.593
I actually stopped by there
before I came here.

1701
01:32:44.593 --> 01:32:45.594
Ain't that right. Paul?

1702
01:32:45.594 --> 01:32:47.495
Oh. yeah.

1703
01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:49.932
See. you girlfriend
said fake cops took it.

1704
01:32:49.932 --> 01:32:51.533
Come on.

1705
01:32:51.533 --> 01:32:52.567
You think we haven't heard
that bullshit before?

1706
01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.436
- She set us up.
- No. she didn't.

1707
01:32:54.436 --> 01:32:55.904
- Charlie.
- She didn't fucking set us up!

1708
01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:57.606
The kid's right.

1709
01:32:57.606 --> 01:33:01.744
If you got a snitch. I'd look
a little more internally.

1710
01:33:01.744 --> 01:33:03.478
And Mabel doesn't know squat.

1711
01:33:03.478 --> 01:33:05.347
And trust me.
we asked her hard.

1712
01:33:05.347 --> 01:33:07.716
You fuck.
What'd you do?

1713
01:33:11.019 --> 01:33:12.688
Call me that again.

1714
01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:13.989
Hey. hey!
Come on!

1715
01:33:13.989 --> 01:33:15.658
- Ah!
- Call me fucker again!

1716
01:33:15.658 --> 01:33:17.660
- Ah!
- Hey. hey. hey!

1717
01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.361
Call me a fuck again!

1718
01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:21.563
- Hey. come on!
- Call me a fuck again!

1719
01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:23.966
Come on!

1720
01:33:23.966 --> 01:33:25.634
I got you.
Just breathe.

1721
01:33:25.634 --> 01:33:27.803
Just breathe.
- Not so fucking brave now?

1722
01:33:29.772 --> 01:33:32.808
Is this your brother?

1723
01:33:32.808 --> 01:33:35.110
Yo. Marky. this big fucker
here. is my brother--

1724
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:37.680
Irish twins. ten months apart.

1725
01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:41.083
You guys look
more spread out than that.

1726
01:33:41.083 --> 01:33:44.252
Still a pain in the ass.
though. right?

1727
01:33:44.252 --> 01:33:45.688
I don't have your heroin.

1728
01:33:45.688 --> 01:33:47.823
Well. if that's true. cap.
then someone in your crew

1729
01:33:47.823 --> 01:33:48.891
blew up the deal.

1730
01:33:48.891 --> 01:33:50.158
Snitch is on your end.

1731
01:33:50.158 --> 01:33:51.593
I doubt it.

1732
01:33:51.593 --> 01:33:53.395
Paulie there's my cousin.

1733
01:33:53.395 --> 01:33:56.231
See. family will fuck you.
but not like that.

1734
01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:57.833
Truth is.
it doesn't fucking matter.

1735
01:33:57.833 --> 01:34:00.402
It's the price
of doing business. all right?

1736
01:34:00.402 --> 01:34:02.204
Some fish you catch.
Some get away.

1737
01:34:02.204 --> 01:34:03.706
Am I right?
- Ah!

1738
01:34:03.706 --> 01:34:04.673
Just breathe. baby.

1739
01:34:06.041 --> 01:34:07.810
Where I'm from.

1740
01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:10.312
you're only as good
as your hard-earned reputation.

1741
01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:12.147
You can't have 'em
laughing at you.

1742
01:34:13.682 --> 01:34:16.451
So I very much wanna get
my dope back.

1743
01:34:16.451 --> 01:34:18.120
Oh. she's having
the baby right now!

1744
01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.121
We're telling the truth!

1745
01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:21.223
Shut the fuck up!

1746
01:34:21.223 --> 01:34:23.025
It doesn't fucking matter!

1747
01:34:23.025 --> 01:34:26.729
The only thing that matters is
this gets resolved tomorrow!

1748
01:34:26.729 --> 01:34:28.496
That's what happens
when you work in the shop!

1749
01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:31.666
You get short fucking notice
when people aren't happy!

1750
01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:33.501
Charlie. hold her!

1751
01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:34.536
Charlie!

1752
01:34:34.536 --> 01:34:35.537
Go!

1753
01:34:40.909 --> 01:34:44.479
Tomorrow morning.
10:00 a.m..

1754
01:34:44.479 --> 01:34:46.915
you're gonna bring my heroin
to Supreme Donuts.

1755
01:34:46.915 --> 01:34:48.550
Otherwise.
your troubles with me

1756
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:50.552
are gonna be over
one way or another.

1757
01:34:50.552 --> 01:34:51.720
Am I being clear?

1758
01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.255
Clear.

1759
01:34:57.325 --> 01:34:59.094
Are we sure?

1760
01:34:59.094 --> 01:35:02.965
Because I'm not talking about
breaking your legs here. yeah?

1761
01:35:02.965 --> 01:35:04.566
I understand!

1762
01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:09.437
Let me explain one more time.

1763
01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:11.206
Hey. hey. hey!
Come on--

1764
01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:12.607
- Oh. oh--

1765
01:35:12.607 --> 01:35:14.242
Wait. stop!

1766
01:35:15.878 --> 01:35:17.545
Tomorrow.

1767
01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:21.784
Let's go.

1768
01:35:21.784 --> 01:35:23.251
It's okay.

1769
01:35:23.251 --> 01:35:24.652
See you soon.

1770
01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:27.422
Nunesy! Nunesy!
Nunesy. 911!

1771
01:35:27.422 --> 01:35:29.691
- Fuck.

1772
01:35:29.691 --> 01:35:30.859
Ah!

1773
01:35:47.776 --> 01:35:49.377
Mabel!

1774
01:35:52.314 --> 01:35:53.581
God. Charlie.

1775
01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:54.649
Mabel.

1776
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:56.218
Charlie. I just--

1777
01:35:56.218 --> 01:35:58.286
I don't want you
to look at me right now.

1778
01:35:58.286 --> 01:36:01.389
It's really ugly.

1779
01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.326
There's no one else
I wanna look at.

1780
01:36:08.897 --> 01:36:11.266
I'm sorry.

1781
01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:13.001
I'm really sorry. Charlie.

1782
01:36:13.001 --> 01:36:14.436
Sorry.

1783
01:36:39.828 --> 01:36:41.429
Can I help you. sir?

1784
01:36:44.032 --> 01:36:45.567
I need some advice.

1785
01:37:06.788 --> 01:37:07.956
Hey. Charlie.

1786
01:37:07.956 --> 01:37:08.957
Oh. shit.

1787
01:37:12.094 --> 01:37:13.795
Mr. Eldridge.

1788
01:37:13.795 --> 01:37:16.331
What the hell
are you doing with that pistol?

1789
01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:19.601
Where's Tom?
What's going on?

1790
01:37:19.601 --> 01:37:20.903
Look. it's a long story.

1791
01:37:20.903 --> 01:37:22.237
You know Anne Marie Costa?

1792
01:37:22.237 --> 01:37:24.272
Know who she is:
Tony Costa's wife.

1793
01:37:24.272 --> 01:37:26.074
Yeah.

1794
01:37:26.074 --> 01:37:29.611
She had a baby today. and. uh.
Tom drove her to the hospital.

1795
01:37:29.611 --> 01:37:31.013
and I haven't seen him since.

1796
01:37:31.013 --> 01:37:32.014
I was hoping he was here.

1797
01:37:32.014 --> 01:37:33.248
So why the gun?

1798
01:37:36.919 --> 01:37:38.353
It's messed up.

1799
01:37:38.353 --> 01:37:39.955
Costa got shot by a burglar
in their house.

1800
01:37:39.955 --> 01:37:44.459
I'm getting a rash from
all your bullshit. Charlie.

1801
01:37:44.459 --> 01:37:45.928
You wanna hear what I know?

1802
01:37:48.463 --> 01:37:49.998
Yeah. sure.

1803
01:37:49.998 --> 01:37:54.469
You boys go out fishing
on the double down.

1804
01:37:54.469 --> 01:37:57.672
You're back in port
after one day.

1805
01:37:57.672 --> 01:38:02.410
I see Tom beat up. screaming
about being set up.

1806
01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:04.779
Tony Costa catches
a burglar in this house.

1807
01:38:04.779 --> 01:38:07.749
gets shot. and you.
the college boy.

1808
01:38:07.749 --> 01:38:09.952
are running around
with a pistol in your belt.

1809
01:38:09.952 --> 01:38:12.587
Even a half-wit
New Bedford police detective

1810
01:38:12.587 --> 01:38:14.889
could figure this shit out.

1811
01:38:14.889 --> 01:38:16.724
I know.
We're grown-ups. you know.

1812
01:38:16.724 --> 01:38:18.126
We can't run to our dads
when things go wrong.

1813
01:38:18.126 --> 01:38:19.494
I'm not your father. Charlie.

1814
01:38:19.494 --> 01:38:21.196
I'm that son of a bitch.
Ray Eldridge.

1815
01:38:21.196 --> 01:38:22.931
everybody tries
to steer clear of.

1816
01:38:25.467 --> 01:38:26.634
Oh. hell.
I don't even know

1817
01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:29.737
what I'm doing here anyway.

1818
01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:33.408
My wife divorced me.
my son won't talk to me.

1819
01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:36.444
and I ought to be dying
down in Texas.

1820
01:38:36.444 --> 01:38:38.846
not up here with a bunch
of goddamn swamp Yankees.

1821
01:38:40.382 --> 01:38:43.218
Shit.

1822
01:38:43.218 --> 01:38:46.221
So why are you here?

1823
01:38:46.221 --> 01:38:47.855
The price
of New England scallops

1824
01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:49.357
is a hell of a lot higher

1825
01:38:49.357 --> 01:38:51.226
than the price
of Gulf Coast shrimp.

1826
01:38:51.226 --> 01:38:52.961
Right.

1827
01:38:56.564 --> 01:38:58.433
And I like
the North Atlantic.

1828
01:39:02.704 --> 01:39:04.239
I heard the whales.

1829
01:39:04.239 --> 01:39:05.940
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

1830
01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:07.909
Whereabouts?

1831
01:39:07.909 --> 01:39:09.611
Wheelhouse
on the "Finestkind."

1832
01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:12.414
Oh.
did you sing along with them?

1833
01:39:12.414 --> 01:39:15.817
- No. I--

1834
01:39:29.631 --> 01:39:33.801
Gotta sing along
with 'em. Charlie.

1835
01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:36.704
Otherwise. you just listening.

1836
01:39:43.578 --> 01:39:45.047
Your father love you. Charlie?

1837
01:39:48.516 --> 01:39:51.153
Yes. sir.

1838
01:39:51.153 --> 01:39:53.121
Well. I love my son too.

1839
01:39:56.724 --> 01:40:00.928
We're in trouble.

1840
01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:03.831
Then why don't you tell me

Wondering if Tom crashed here.

1853
01:41:19.441 --> 01:41:20.708
I waited for him all night
at the marsh.

1854
01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:22.043
but he didn't show.

1855
01:41:22.043 --> 01:41:23.545
You know where he went?

1856
01:41:23.545 --> 01:41:25.280
Yeah. Tom came
ten minutes ago.

1857
01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:26.748
out of his fucking skull.

1858
01:41:26.748 --> 01:41:28.316
He asked to see
my survival suit .38

1859
01:41:28.316 --> 01:41:30.952
and stuck it in my face
like I'm the fucking snitch.

1860
01:41:33.555 --> 01:41:34.822
Did you know where he went?

1861
01:41:36.391 --> 01:41:38.493
He went to go see Skeemo
at his grandmother's.

1862
01:41:39.727 --> 01:41:42.197
You know the address?

1863

All right.
It's gonna be all right. okay?

1866
01:41:49.137 --> 01:41:50.538
Charlie!

1867
01:41:50.538 --> 01:41:52.240
Tommy's wrong. man.

1868
01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:55.076

I didn't hear you come in.

1877
01:42:37.485 --> 01:42:39.354
I got a pizza.

1878
01:42:39.354 --> 01:42:40.888
You want some?

1879
01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:44.592
That's. uh--that's
a lot of dope there. Skeemo.

1880
01:42:44.592 --> 01:42:46.328
Where the money come from?

1881
01:42:46.328 --> 01:42:49.130
I hit a scratch card
for. like. 500 bucks.

1882
01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:50.398
Oh. okay.

1883
01:42:50.398 --> 01:42:51.566
Can you believe that shit?

1884
01:42:51.566 --> 01:42:53.801
Huh.

1885
01:42:53.801 --> 01:42:55.069
Lucky day. you know?

1886
01:42:55.069 --> 01:42:58.506
I went in there.
I wasn't even gonna buy one.

1887
01:42:58.506 --> 01:43:01.543
Bought some cigarettes.
I had five bucks left over.

1888
01:43:08.683 --> 01:43:12.487
Swallow it.

1889
01:43:12.487 --> 01:43:14.389
Swallow it. you snitch.

1890
01:43:17.792 --> 01:43:19.594
Swallow it.

1891
01:43:19.594 --> 01:43:23.097
Fuck.

1892
01:43:23.097 --> 01:43:25.333
What the fuck is wrong
with you. man?

1893
01:43:25.333 --> 01:43:26.468
Jesus.
- Tell me what's up.

1894
01:43:26.468 --> 01:43:27.702
Fuck.

1895
01:43:27.702 --> 01:43:28.636
I don't know
what you think I did.

1896
01:43:28.636 --> 01:43:29.637
Tell me what you--

1897
01:43:29.637 --> 01:43:30.938
Jesus Christ. Tom.

1898
01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:32.674
Charlie. your brother's
gone fucking crazy.

1899
01:43:32.674 --> 01:43:34.208
- Put the gun down!
- Christ. Tom!

1900
01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:35.843
Get out of here. Charlie.
Go home. Charlie!

1901
01:43:35.843 --> 01:43:37.178
Tom. listen to me!

1902
01:43:37.178 --> 01:43:38.613
I don't know
what the fuck he's--

1903
01:43:38.613 --> 01:43:42.083
oh--fuck!

1904
01:43:44.319 --> 01:43:46.288
I needed a fix. all right?

1905
01:43:46.288 --> 01:43:49.056
I needed a fucking fix
to know I could when I had to!

1906
01:43:50.592 --> 01:43:51.693
Can't trust a junkie. right?

1907
01:43:51.693 --> 01:43:54.228
Don't you know?

1908
01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:56.964
Well. I can't trust
the junkie inside me.

1909
01:43:56.964 --> 01:44:01.135
Ray dies thinking his boat
is lost because of you.

1910
01:44:01.135 --> 01:44:02.203
No.

1911
01:44:04.472 --> 01:44:06.374
That's your fault. not mine.

1912
01:44:06.374 --> 01:44:08.576
You're the captain.
You crossed the line. not me.

1913
01:44:08.576 --> 01:44:09.611
That's on you.

1914
01:44:09.611 --> 01:44:11.012
Shut the fuck up!

1915
01:44:13.748 --> 01:44:16.050
Tom. you're my brother.
Look at me.

1916
01:44:16.050 --> 01:44:19.321
Look at me.

1917
01:44:19.321 --> 01:44:21.523
You live and you die.

1918
01:44:21.523 --> 01:44:23.625
It's the in-between part
that's important.

1919
01:44:24.959 --> 01:44:26.794
This is the in-between part.

1920
01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:34.035
Please.

1921
01:44:45.012 --> 01:44:46.481
I feel
like I'm losing something.

1922
01:44:46.481 --> 01:44:48.149
I don't know how
to get it back.

1923
01:44:54.756 --> 01:44:56.358
Yeah. I know exa--

1924
01:44:56.358 --> 01:44:58.860
I found it.

1925
01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:01.763
Good for you.

1926
01:45:01.763 --> 01:45:05.066
Yeah. right here.

1927
01:45:05.066 --> 01:45:10.772
I found you.

1928
01:45:10.772 --> 01:45:15.410
I got you. you fucking nutcase.

1929
01:45:19.714 --> 01:45:22.384
Come on.

1930
01:45:22.384 --> 01:45:24.352
Gotta make a deal.

1931
01:45:49.711 --> 01:45:51.278
Now that right there. Marky.

1932
01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:53.981
that's a goddamn righteous
cruller right there.

1933
01:45:53.981 --> 01:45:55.717
I appreciate that with you.

1934
01:45:55.717 --> 01:45:59.787
Always. you always listen
to what I say

1935
01:45:59.787 --> 01:46:01.623
or why I feel a thing.

1936
01:46:01.623 --> 01:46:04.225
Let me guess:
will work for food?

1937
01:46:05.993 --> 01:46:11.365
I'm Ray Eldridge.
Tom Eldridge's father.

1938
01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:13.067
So what?

1939
01:46:13.067 --> 01:46:14.869
I want you
to leave my son alone.

1940
01:46:17.405 --> 01:46:20.307
You believe
this fucking guy?

1941
01:46:21.909 --> 01:46:23.110
What. you hold his hand

1942
01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:25.312
when you walk him
across the street?

1943
01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:27.949
Wipe his runny nose?

1944
01:46:27.949 --> 01:46:29.383
Ah. I got it.

1945
01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:31.886
When it snows out. you clip
his mittens to his jacket

1946
01:46:31.886 --> 01:46:35.389
so doesn't lose one.

1947
01:46:35.389 --> 01:46:38.726
This motherfucker
coming in here.

1948
01:46:38.726 --> 01:46:41.463
I want you to call it a day.

1949
01:46:41.463 --> 01:46:43.030
I can't do that.

1950
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:45.166
Your kid owes me big time
on something.

1951
01:46:45.166 --> 01:46:49.971
I got $15.000 in this sack.

1952
01:46:49.971 --> 01:46:52.974
I'll give it to ya.

1953
01:46:52.974 --> 01:46:56.511
I appreciate that.
I do.

1954
01:46:56.511 --> 01:47:00.682
But you'd need. I don't know.
another 300 sacks.

1955
01:47:00.682 --> 01:47:03.885
Does that help you understand
the scope of this issue?

1956
01:47:03.885 --> 01:47:08.222
Please. leave Tom alone.

1957
01:47:09.657 --> 01:47:11.759
I wish I could. all right?

1958
01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:13.227
I got boys of my own.

1959
01:47:13.227 --> 01:47:16.531
I'd hate to see 'em
jammed up like this.

1960
01:47:16.531 --> 01:47:18.566
But maybe. you know.
you should have raised your son

1961
01:47:18.566 --> 01:47:21.235
not to go into business
with guys like me.

1962
01:47:21.235 --> 01:47:23.571
you know. maybe doubled up
on the belt.

1963
01:47:23.571 --> 01:47:25.306
been a better role model.

1964
01:47:25.306 --> 01:47:26.941
Coulda. shoulda. woulda.
But I'll tell you what.

1965
01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:28.576
I'm gonna do you
a favor. all right?

1966
01:47:28.576 --> 01:47:31.012
Give you a head start.

1967
01:47:31.012 --> 01:47:32.547
Why don't you go down here
to this funeral home.

1968
01:47:32.547 --> 01:47:34.215
and I want you to go
in there and pick out

1969
01:47:34.215 --> 01:47:35.983
a fucking pine box
for your kid.

1970
01:47:35.983 --> 01:47:37.151
because he's gonna fucking
need one.

1971
01:47:37.151 --> 01:47:38.886
Now. get the fuck out here!

1972
01:47:46.794 --> 01:47:48.963
This motherfucker
coming in here.

1973
01:47:52.066 --> 01:47:53.234
No. oh. sh--

1974
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:12.086
There's a man outside
waiting on us.

1975
01:48:14.756 --> 01:48:16.057
He's pretty rough.

1976
01:48:16.057 --> 01:48:20.261
Go fuck yourself.

1977
01:49:26.728 --> 01:49:29.296
You hear the price
of scallops this morning?

1978
01:49:31.733 --> 01:49:34.535
$25.

1979
01:49:34.535 --> 01:49:38.606
Sandra Jane brought in
18.000 pounds.

1980
01:49:55.256 --> 01:49:57.191
What'd you do. Pop?

1981
01:50:01.562 --> 01:50:07.468
Someday. if you ever have
a son.

1982
01:50:07.468 --> 01:50:10.437
the first time you look at him.

1983
01:50:10.437 --> 01:50:15.176
you get a feeling all at once

1984
01:50:15.176 --> 01:50:20.514
that you'd die for him.

1985
01:50:20.514 --> 01:50:23.117
Little thing
you never saw before.

1986
01:50:23.117 --> 01:50:27.054
and you would
stone cold die for him.

1987
01:50:29.256 --> 01:50:32.093
That feeling doesn't go away.

1988
01:50:32.093 --> 01:50:35.963
You might forget.

1989
01:50:35.963 --> 01:50:38.365
But it's always there.

1990
01:50:42.036 --> 01:50:44.038
Always there.

1991
01:51:00.822 --> 01:51:05.559
I--I love you. Pop.

1992
01:51:05.559 --> 01:51:07.695
I do.

1993
01:51:12.233 --> 01:51:15.636
I've tried real hard
to not ever need anyone.

1994
01:51:18.906 --> 01:51:21.108
Don't you do that.

1995
01:51:28.049 --> 01:51:29.516
Don't let him do that. Charlie.

1996
01:51:33.955 --> 01:51:35.489
No. sir.

1997
01:52:05.686 --> 01:52:08.990
Hey.

1998
01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:11.058
You all right?

1999
01:52:11.058 --> 01:52:12.126
You think
they're gonna give me

2000
01:52:12.126 --> 01:52:13.761
a hard time in there?

2001
01:52:19.233 --> 01:52:21.335
Mabel. come on.
You're safe with me.

2002
01:52:24.538 --> 01:52:26.540
I like trusting you. Charlie.

2003
01:52:31.412 --> 01:52:33.815
How do I look. white boy?

2004
01:52:33.815 --> 01:52:36.417
How do you look?

2005
01:52:36.417 --> 01:52:38.185
Fucking incredible.

2006
01:52:49.831 --> 01:52:50.832
Mm-hmm.

2007
01:52:50.832 --> 01:52:53.000
Almost ready.

2008
01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.668
My famous meatloaf.

2009
01:52:59.573 --> 01:53:01.675
So where did you go to school?

2010
01:53:01.675 --> 01:53:02.910
New Bedford High?

2011
01:53:06.981 --> 01:53:07.982
Yeah.

2012
01:53:07.982 --> 01:53:10.885
Blue House. Tan House?

2013
01:53:10.885 --> 01:53:12.786
I was actually in Gold House.

2014
01:53:12.786 --> 01:53:14.856
Me too.

2015
01:53:14.856 --> 01:53:16.924
You can take the girl
out of New Bedford.

2016
01:53:16.924 --> 01:53:20.294
but you can't take
New Bedford out of the girl.

2017
01:53:20.294 --> 01:53:21.929
And you shouldn't want to.

2018
01:53:25.266 --> 01:53:28.069
I keep her right here.

2019
01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:30.504
So what'd you wanna ask me?

2020
01:53:30.504 --> 01:53:34.375
Oh. uh. I wanted
to borrow some money.

2021
01:53:34.375 --> 01:53:36.911
Sure.

2022
01:53:36.911 --> 01:53:39.213
How much?

2023
01:53:39.213 --> 01:53:41.182
$100.000.

2024
01:53:45.786 --> 01:53:49.790
To pay the fine
on Ray Eldridge's boat.

2025
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:52.126
Right.

2026
01:53:52.126 --> 01:53:53.260
Jesus Christ.

2027
01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:54.795
After everything
that's happened.

2028
01:53:54.795 --> 01:53:56.830
everything that's gone
so horribly wrong.

2029
01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:58.699
you still wanna fish?

2030
01:53:58.699 --> 01:54:00.834
Yeah.

2031
01:54:00.834 --> 01:54:02.136
I do.

2032
01:54:02.136 --> 01:54:03.704
Just because
I'm a goddamn lawyer

2033
01:54:03.704 --> 01:54:05.039
doesn't mean you should be.
- Don't get mad. Dad.

2034
01:54:05.039 --> 01:54:07.141
What do you want me to do?

2035
01:54:07.141 --> 01:54:08.375
I want you to listen to me!

2036
01:54:08.375 --> 01:54:09.877
- O--okay. Charlie.
- All right?

2037
01:54:09.877 --> 01:54:11.312
But you haven't said
anything that makes sense

2038
01:54:11.312 --> 01:54:13.680
to me in a long time.

2039
01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:17.218
Look. I have done hard work
when I was young.

2040
01:54:17.218 --> 01:54:18.685
and it's fulfilling.

2041
01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:19.520
It is.

2042
01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:21.555
But this is so dangerous.

2043
01:54:21.555 --> 01:54:23.824
Yeah. exactly.
That's what I love about it.

2044
01:54:23.824 --> 01:54:26.260
You gotta fight out there.
You gotta be brave.

2045
01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:29.796
You gotta be smart.
You gotta be strong.

2046
01:54:29.796 --> 01:54:31.432
I feel alive
when I'm out there.

2047
01:54:31.432 --> 01:54:32.666
I feel connected.

2048
01:54:32.666 --> 01:54:34.268
I feel like I'm making
my own choices.

2049
01:54:34.268 --> 01:54:36.670
I feel like I'm getting closer
to who I am!

2050
01:54:36.670 --> 01:54:39.440
But Charlie. law school
is gonna give you

2051
01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:43.377
so many options.
- Dad. listen to me!

2052
01:54:43.377 --> 01:54:45.312
I'm not going to law school.

2053
01:54:52.753 --> 01:54:55.957
So...

2054
01:54:55.957 --> 01:54:59.293
If you stuck with this.

2055
01:54:59.293 --> 01:55:00.827
how long before you'd be
a captain?

2056
01:55:00.827 --> 01:55:02.763
I'm not sure
I wanna be captain.

2057
01:55:02.763 --> 01:55:03.931
Why not?

2058
01:55:03.931 --> 01:55:06.833
Tom's captain.

2059
01:55:06.833 --> 01:55:09.703
I couldn't be with him
if I was one too.

2060
01:55:09.703 --> 01:55:11.638
And Tom needs me.

2061
01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:14.775
He needs me.
I need him.

2062
01:55:14.775 --> 01:55:16.944
Dad. I have to be
with my brother.

2063
01:55:20.714 --> 01:55:22.383
I have to.

2064
01:55:22.383 --> 01:55:25.819
Do you understand?

2065
01:55:25.819 --> 01:55:28.122
I do.

2066
01:55:28.122 --> 01:55:31.692
Fuck.

2067
01:55:31.692 --> 01:55:33.027
But I--I do.

2068
01:55:36.497 --> 01:55:38.532
Tell Tom to come
see me tomorrow.

2069
01:55:40.034 --> 01:55:41.568
I'll help out
with the legal work.

2070
01:55:41.568 --> 01:55:46.540
and. uh. I'll pay
the fine on the boat.

2071
01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:48.242
Th--this is not a gift.

2072
01:55:48.242 --> 01:55:49.476
Okay.

2073
01:55:49.476 --> 01:55:50.944
- It's not a gift.
- Okay. all right.

2074
01:55:50.944 --> 01:55:52.679
Not a gift. yeah.

2075
01:55:52.679 --> 01:55:53.947
Of course.
We will pay it back.

2076
01:55:53.947 --> 01:55:56.317
Well. I'm not sure
it's a loan either.

2077
01:55:56.317 --> 01:55:58.452
What do you mean?

2078
01:55:58.452 --> 01:56:01.622
I think I might want in
on this.

2079
01:56:01.622 --> 01:56:03.324
be your business partner.

2080
01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:06.827
I--I'm out of my fucking mind.

2081
01:56:12.633 --> 01:56:14.501
It's great. ain't it?

2082
01:56:19.073 --> 01:56:24.811
Wherever
you're going with this.

2083
01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:26.913
I want you to take me
with you. Charlie.

2084
01:56:34.021 --> 01:56:35.589
All right.

2085
01:56:40.027 --> 01:56:42.529
You're crazy.
- Oh. not as crazy as you.

2086
01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:45.499
I love you. Dad.

2087
01:57:01.082 --> 01:57:03.117
There he is.

2088
01:57:05.519 --> 01:57:07.321
Here.

2089
01:57:07.321 --> 01:57:08.822
I'll take care of you.

2090
01:57:11.658 --> 01:57:13.794
Is "Finestkind"
ready to rumble?

2091
01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:38.585
Hope nobody's in a hurry.

2092
01:58:45.486 --> 01:58:49.323
Yeah!

2093
01:58:49.323 --> 01:58:51.892
Not dead yet. Mr. Eldridge!

2094
01:58:51.892 --> 01:58:53.160
Whoo!

2095
01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:54.528
Crazy fishermen.

2096
01:58:54.528 --> 01:58:57.431
Oh.

2097
01:58:57.431 --> 01:58:59.466
Not dead yet!

2098
01:59:04.271 --> 01:59:06.907
Whoo!

2099
01:59:13.547 --> 01:59:17.218
- Whoo!
- Not dead yet. Mr. Eldridge!

2100
01:59:32.299 --> 01:59:35.001
Outward goddamn bound!

2101
01:59:37.871 --> 01:59:39.940
Outward goddamn bound.

2102
01:59:46.613 --> 01:59:49.250
Mabel!

2103
01:59:49.250 --> 01:59:50.617
Charlie!

2104
01:59:52.553 --> 01:59:54.187
Whoo!

2105
01:59:54.187 --> 01:59:55.456
Charlie!

2106
02:00:16.543 --> 02:00:19.145
Finest kind. baby!
