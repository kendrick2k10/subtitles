00:36:48.815 --> 00:36:51.339
and the changes this has made
in my life is unbelievable.

539
00:36:51.383 --> 00:36:53.385
I cannot thank you enough.

540
00:36:53.428 --> 00:36:55.082
- I'm so happy that we
could make a difference.

541
00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:56.388
- Absolutely.

542
00:36:56.431 --> 00:36:57.824
- Can I get one of
just the two of you?

543
00:36:57.867 --> 00:36:59.347
- Sure.

544
00:36:59.391 --> 00:37:01.610
- Oh. no. no. no. we're.
we're a package deal here.

545
00:37:04.091 --> 00:37:05.440
[camera shutters]

546
00:37:05.484 --> 00:37:06.789
- Thank you.

547
00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:08.487
- Thank you so much.
- Not a problem.

548
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.924

Senior are on the same show?

[audience applauds]

550
00:37:14.754 --> 00:37:16.451
- [Announcer] It's Crystal Blue.

551
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.413
- And we're back with
Harvard-educated inventor.

552
00:37:21.456 --> 00:37:22.240
Vic Beckett.

[audience applauds]

554
00:37:25.504 --> 00:37:27.375
This is pretty amazing Vic.

555
00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:29.595
What do you think. you want
him to try it out on me?

556
00:37:29.638 --> 00:37:33.251
[audience applauds]

557
00:37:33.294 --> 00:37:36.123
Well you heard
them. make me happy.

[audience cheers]

559
00:37:38.343 --> 00:37:40.736
- Okay. may I?

560
00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.391
- Oh. such a gentleman.

561
00:37:43.435 --> 00:37:48.396
Of course.
[audience laughs]

562
00:37:52.444 --> 00:37:53.880
What. are you
callin' the lifeline?

563
00:37:53.923 --> 00:37:55.360
[audience laughs]

564
00:37:55.403 --> 00:37:59.277
- Well. the whole system
operates via smartphone.

565
00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.716
so it just needs a moment to
read where you are emotionally.

566
00:38:03.759 --> 00:38:06.414
- So this thing is smarter
than the average man.

567
00:38:06.458 --> 00:38:09.243
[audience laughs]

568
00:38:11.898 --> 00:38:14.379
- Okay. it looks
like it's good to go.

569
00:38:14.422 --> 00:38:15.205
Are you ready?

570
00:38:29.524 --> 00:38:32.614
[audience muttering]

[audience applauds]

572
00:38:36.749 --> 00:38:38.141
- This is remarkable.

573
00:38:40.187 --> 00:38:45.148
I can't describe it. it's.
it's an amazing feeling.

574
00:38:45.845 --> 00:38:48.543
[audience applauds]

575
00:38:49.501 --> 00:38:50.806
This is magnificent.

576
00:38:52.417 --> 00:38:55.507
This deserves more than
just my seal of approval.

577
00:38:55.550 --> 00:39:00.468
[audience applauds]
[whooshing and tinkling]

578
00:39:03.471 --> 00:39:04.690
- Oh. Henry.

579
00:39:04.733 --> 00:39:05.430
- What is it?

580
00:39:13.263 --> 00:39:14.743
[phone rings]
[office bustle]

581
00:39:14.787 --> 00:39:16.658
- [Vic] We currently
have 25 transmitters

582
00:39:16.702 --> 00:39:19.792
broadcasting to 300 users.

583
00:39:19.835 --> 00:39:22.316
- Great. how'd you
select this group?

584
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.014
- Well. we've had thousands
of applicants at this point.

585
00:39:25.058 --> 00:39:27.495
We've selected a
varying range of ages

586
00:39:27.539 --> 00:39:29.454
and temperaments in
order to track efficacy.

587
00:39:30.716 --> 00:39:34.023
So far. it's been
working beautifully.

588
00:39:34.067 --> 00:39:36.722
[birds chirping]

589
00:39:40.552 --> 00:39:42.423
We're still testing our limits.

590
00:39:42.467 --> 00:39:43.250
Excuse me.

591
00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.557
- What is going on?

592
00:39:47.733 --> 00:39:48.473
- Shit.

593
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:54.000
- Hey buddy. hey.

594
00:39:54.043 --> 00:39:55.436
- Hey. get the
fuck away from me.

595
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.527
- Just calm down. calm
down. okay. don't worry.

596
00:39:59.571 --> 00:40:01.529
Just give it a moment.

597
00:40:01.573 --> 00:40:02.487
This'll pass.

598
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.228
Ah. you feelin' better?

599
00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:09.102
- Yeah. yeah.

600
00:40:09.145 --> 00:40:09.929
- You good?

601
00:40:11.147 --> 00:40:12.192
- Yeah.

602
00:40:12.235 --> 00:40:13.106
- Okay.

603
00:40:13.149 --> 00:40:14.412
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

604
00:40:23.072 --> 00:40:25.727
That was just a
mild side effect.

605
00:40:25.771 --> 00:40:29.383
It just simply means that he
was transmitting too long.

606
00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:31.603
Henry. make sure you're
tracking how long he was on

607
00:40:31.646 --> 00:40:32.952
and reduce his next session.

608
00:40:33.953 --> 00:40:35.258
- Question.

609
00:40:35.302 --> 00:40:36.825
How often does that happen?

610
00:40:36.869 --> 00:40:38.348
- Well. it--

611
00:40:38.392 --> 00:40:40.089
- Very. very sporadically.
we just need to--

612
00:40:40.133 --> 00:40:43.266
- That cannot happen again.

613
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:45.878
I barely got the
approvals as it is.

614
00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:48.141
Hey guys. if anyone
caught wind of that.

615
00:40:48.184 --> 00:40:49.708
we'd be back to square one.

616
00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:51.971
- Wait. wait. it really
very rarely happens.

617
00:40:52.014 --> 00:40:53.538
it only. it's. it's. only--

618
00:40:53.581 --> 00:40:55.017
- Make it stop.

619
00:41:08.204 --> 00:41:10.468
- That is so not Henry.

620
00:41:10.511 --> 00:41:13.427
- Oh yes. it is [laughs].

621
00:41:14.602 --> 00:41:16.169
- He looks ridiculous.

622
00:41:16.212 --> 00:41:18.563
- You should see him. he's
with a different Russian model

623
00:41:18.606 --> 00:41:20.652
every single night.

624
00:41:20.695 --> 00:41:23.611
[gentle piano music]

625
00:41:24.873 --> 00:41:25.657
What?

626
00:41:27.746 --> 00:41:29.704
- Is that what you want?

627
00:41:31.053 --> 00:41:32.228
- What do you mean?

628
00:41:33.752 --> 00:41:35.667
- Do you regret anything?

629
00:41:36.972 --> 00:41:37.712
- Of course not.

630
00:41:39.409 --> 00:41:41.673
You're the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

631
00:41:43.326 --> 00:41:45.546
I wouldn't trade the last
eight months for anything.

632
00:41:48.854 --> 00:41:49.594
- Really?

633
00:41:50.769 --> 00:41:52.031
- Yes really [laughs].

634
00:41:53.815 --> 00:41:56.514
I don't do this for the money.
I could care less about that.

635
00:41:58.211 --> 00:42:01.562
I do this for the same reason
that you work at the clinic.

636
00:42:01.606 --> 00:42:02.868
to make a difference.

637
00:42:06.088 --> 00:42:09.744
I don't need cars or suits.

638
00:42:09.788 --> 00:42:12.138
I certainly don't need
any Russian models.

639
00:42:15.184 --> 00:42:16.751
You're my everything.

640
00:42:30.765 --> 00:42:35.683
Do you have anything
simple. I guess classic?

641
00:42:36.989 --> 00:42:38.730
- [Jeweler] Oh. I have just
what you're looking for.

642
00:42:43.735 --> 00:42:44.997
- [Host] Enough. enough.

643
00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.346
let's boil it down
to brass tacks.

644
00:42:46.389 --> 00:42:47.869
GE. diamond or dog?
- It's time. it's time.

645
00:42:47.913 --> 00:42:49.610
- [Reporter 1] I
still think diamond.

646
00:42:49.654 --> 00:42:51.569
- [Reporter 2] Ridiculous. dog.

647
00:42:51.612 --> 00:42:53.962
- [Reporter 3] I say diamond.
this is going to turn around.

648
00:42:54.006 --> 00:42:55.703
- Looks like GE's still strong.

649
00:42:55.747 --> 00:42:58.053
Next. the Mudita
offering's coming out soon.

650
00:42:58.097 --> 00:43:00.926
You've all had it in front
of you. diamond or dog?

651
00:43:00.969 --> 00:43:02.884
- I say diamond.
princess cut at that.

652
00:43:04.146 --> 00:43:05.626
Seems amazing. I
think there's like

653
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:07.672
a million people
waiting to sign up.

654
00:43:07.715 --> 00:43:11.763
With their price points
projecting four billion a year.

655
00:43:11.806 --> 00:43:14.243
I say this is going to be
the IPO of the century.

656
00:43:14.287 --> 00:43:16.768
I don't own it.
but I'm going to.

657
00:43:16.811 --> 00:43:17.812
- Logan?

658
00:43:17.856 --> 00:43:19.205
- I'm skeptical.

659
00:43:19.248 --> 00:43:21.511
Love the concept. but
not sure if it's hype.

660
00:43:21.555 --> 00:43:23.296
I want it to be real.
that's worth something.

661
00:43:23.339 --> 00:43:25.690
but my mother always
said. beware of things

662
00:43:25.733 --> 00:43:27.735
that sound too good to be true.

663
00:43:27.779 --> 00:43:29.215
[thunder claps]
Frankly. I'm neutral.

664
00:43:29.258 --> 00:43:30.999
- Fair enough. fair
enough. come on baby.

665
00:43:31.043 --> 00:43:32.305
- [Host] And you?

666
00:43:32.348 --> 00:43:34.742
- Skeptical. more
than skeptical.

667
00:43:34.786 --> 00:43:36.048
I gave this to my science geeks

668
00:43:36.091 --> 00:43:37.527
at the University of
Chicago to analyze.

669
00:43:37.571 --> 00:43:39.486
and they said it's
science fiction.

670
00:43:39.529 --> 00:43:41.183
It sounds like a scam.

671
00:43:41.227 --> 00:43:42.794
Not to say that
scams can't work.

672
00:43:42.837 --> 00:43:44.752
but I also looked into
the founder of this thing.

673
00:43:44.796 --> 00:43:47.842
Vic Beckett. his
background is sketchy.

674
00:43:47.886 --> 00:43:49.801
This isn't just a dog.
this is a pit bull

675
00:43:49.844 --> 00:43:51.803
that ripped the face
off your eight year old.

676
00:43:51.846 --> 00:43:53.369
- So everybody. recap.

677
00:43:53.413 --> 00:43:54.414
- Diamond.

678
00:43:54.457 --> 00:43:55.763
- Neutral.

679
00:43:55.807 --> 00:43:57.112
- Steroid-infused
pit bull of death.

680
00:43:57.156 --> 00:43:59.201
[host laughs]

681
00:43:59.245 --> 00:44:00.768
- It isn't looking
good for Mudita.

682
00:44:00.812 --> 00:44:03.945
and no offense to the pit
bulls out there watching.

683

685
00:44:10.865 --> 00:44:11.561
- Hello?

686
00:44:13.781 --> 00:44:14.826
No comment.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.698
[dramatic instrumental music]

688
00:44:17.742 --> 00:44:20.701
- You know the science.
go make us look good.

689
00:44:20.745 --> 00:44:22.050
- How?

690
00:44:22.094 --> 00:44:23.312
- You're the face of this thing.

691
00:44:23.356 --> 00:44:26.098
You go on the shows.
you clear it up.

692
00:44:26.141 --> 00:44:26.925
Fix it.

693
00:44:28.317 --> 00:44:31.190
Look. you got an offer
to go on Newsline.

694
00:44:31.233 --> 00:44:33.018
You go out and you
talk up the company.

695
00:44:33.061 --> 00:44:36.499
If you play it right. no one
is going to remember this

696
00:44:36.543 --> 00:44:39.807
by the time the IPO
comes out in six months.

697
00:44:39.851 --> 00:44:41.635
We're more than good. Vic.

698
00:44:43.942 --> 00:44:45.073
More than good.

699
00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.513
- And we're back
with Vic Beckett.

700
00:44:50.557 --> 00:44:53.734
He is the founder of the very
controversial company. Mudita.

701
00:44:55.910 --> 00:45:00.480
- I don't know if controversial
is fair to describe Mudita.

702
00:45:00.523 --> 00:45:02.787
- You should call
it blasphemous.

703
00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:04.571
- How so. preacher?

704
00:45:04.614 --> 00:45:06.616
- This is an abomination.

705
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.316
Emotions come from God.
not from a machine.

706
00:45:10.359 --> 00:45:11.404
- How do you respond?

707
00:45:13.275 --> 00:45:16.888
- Well. it's. it's not
a machine. actually.

708
00:45:16.931 --> 00:45:21.283
The computer program
acts as a conduit.

709
00:45:21.327 --> 00:45:24.199
The emotions come
from living people.

710

- This is where I take umbridge.

00:45:27.376 --> 00:45:28.682

00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:34.470
and tapping into their psyche.
sapping their emotions.

714
00:45:34.514 --> 00:45:36.864
- [laughs] It isn't sapping.

715
00:45:36.908 --> 00:45:39.780
- This should not
be a commodity.

716
00:45:39.824 --> 00:45:42.783
Much more research is needed
before I'd feel comfortable

717
00:45:42.827 --> 00:45:45.177
signing off on
anything of this ilk.

718
00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.005
- That's quite a statement.

719
00:45:47.048 --> 00:45:51.096
- And it happens that I agree
with Preacher Jack. for once.

720
00:45:51.139 --> 00:45:52.619
- Amen brother.

721
00:45:52.662 --> 00:45:56.362
- Not for religious reasons.
for scientific ones.

722
00:45:56.405 --> 00:46:00.192
As a humanist. I don't
believe this is the direction

723
00:46:00.235 --> 00:46:01.846
that humanity should be taking.

724
00:46:03.412 --> 00:46:05.806
- Well. we're gonna Father
Jack and Dr. Karis go.

725
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:08.069
and we're gonna get to
topic two in the hour.

726
00:46:08.113 --> 00:46:09.244
Thank you gentlemen.

727
00:46:09.288 --> 00:46:10.376
- Thanks for having me.

728
00:46:10.419 --> 00:46:11.986
- Jesus loves you. Beckett.

729
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.945
- I'd like to discuss
your background.

730
00:46:13.988 --> 00:46:16.077
I mean. there's been
a lot of controversy

731
00:46:16.121 --> 00:46:17.775
and speculation about it lately.

732
00:46:17.818 --> 00:46:19.124
and I'm sure you
wanna clear the air.

733
00:46:19.167 --> 00:46:21.300
- Yes thank you. I
would really enjoy that.

734
00:46:22.257 --> 00:46:23.171
- Wanna jump right in?

735
00:46:23.215 --> 00:46:23.955
- [Vic] Sure.

736
00:46:25.173 --> 00:46:27.741
- Why did you leave
Harvard Medical?

737
00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:29.656
- Well. after
completing three years.

738
00:46:29.699 --> 00:46:32.920
I realized what my
calling in life was.

739
00:46:32.964 --> 00:46:37.882
I've always been a research
person through and through.

740
00:46:39.057 --> 00:46:40.319
More of a scientist
than a doctor.

741
00:46:40.362 --> 00:46:44.584
And so I chose to
leave to do what I love

742
00:46:44.627 --> 00:46:46.847
so that I could
do the most good.

743
00:46:46.891 --> 00:46:48.588
- Hm.

744
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:51.243
You know what you're
saying directly contradicts

745
00:46:51.286 --> 00:46:54.550
the information that we've
uncovered in our investigation.

746
00:46:56.944 --> 00:47:00.165
Isn't it true that when
you were in medical school.

747
00:47:00.208 --> 00:47:02.341
you volunteered to work
in the pathology lab

748
00:47:02.384 --> 00:47:04.038
and perform autopsies?

749
00:47:05.605 --> 00:47:07.085
- Yes.

750
00:47:07.128 --> 00:47:09.217
- And isn't it true that
your departure from Harvard

751
00:47:09.261 --> 00:47:11.480
was precipitated by
the improprieties

752
00:47:11.524 --> 00:47:15.049
that you perpetrated in
that said pathology lab?

753
00:47:17.095 --> 00:47:20.228
- I. I don't know how
this pertains to Mudita.

754
00:47:20.272 --> 00:47:21.839
which is a great--
- Our records show

755
00:47:21.882 --> 00:47:24.972
that there was a suicide attempt
right after these charges.

756
00:47:26.017 --> 00:47:29.629
Admit it. wasn't it
true that you left.

757
00:47:29.672 --> 00:47:32.197
you were forced to leave
under this cloud of secrecy

758
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.807
due to those improprieties?

759
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:36.157
- I. I don't know where you're
getting your information.

760
00:47:36.201 --> 00:47:38.203
- [Becky] And didn't
that cloud of secrecy

761
00:47:38.246 --> 00:47:41.815
have to do with unauthorized
experiments with the cadavers?

762
00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:43.251
- Look. it was--

763
00:47:43.295 --> 00:47:45.950
- Did you take body parts?

764
00:47:45.993 --> 00:47:48.648
Did you take brain
tissue from people

765
00:47:48.691 --> 00:47:50.911
that had just died and
without permission?

766
00:47:50.955 --> 00:47:52.608
- There were no body parts.

767
00:47:52.652 --> 00:47:55.046
- Why were the records
sealed. Mr. Beckett?

768
00:47:56.874 --> 00:47:59.093
I mean. if you
left. as you said.

769
00:47:59.137 --> 00:48:01.617
for the greater good and
to pursue your research.

770
00:48:01.661 --> 00:48:04.011
then why the confidentiality?

771
00:48:06.361 --> 00:48:08.233

- No need.

783

out. hear me out--

786

you did in the past.

Okay. I care that you
didn't trust me enough

you did nothing but lie to me.
