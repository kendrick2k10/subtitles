Hello. Mr. Roth.

00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:09.049
My name is Abigail Peterson

207
00:13:11.355 --> 00:13:13.183
I'm a crisis negotiator.

00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:16.012
I know you're dealing with

209
00:13:16.186 --> 00:13:18.014
and confusion right now.

210
00:13:18.754 --> 00:13:21.496
I want to assure you
our single goal at this time

211
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.673
is to ensure the safety
of your daughter. Ruby.

212
00:13:25.195 --> 00:13:27.110
We just need to know
she's alright.

213
00:13:27.328 --> 00:13:29.591
Now I think it's best
if you bring her back

214
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.724
so we can help you make
sense of what's happened here.

215
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:36.293
We need to know
that Ruby is alright. Tom.

216
00:13:36.467 --> 00:13:38.818

[Sarah on phone]
Mr. Roth.

229
00:14:22.252 --> 00:14:24.211
- What's going on?
-Everything's fine.

230
00:14:24.385 --> 00:14:26.430
The Police called my mum
looking for Ruby.

231
00:14:26.735 --> 00:14:28.519
-Sarah. listen.
- What. what did you do?

232
00:14:28.693 --> 00:14:30.608
-Sarah. listen to me.
- I don't. don'’t think I should.

233
00:14:30.782 --> 00:14:32.306
-Sarah!
- You'’re scaring me!

234
00:14:32.523 --> 00:14:34.134
[Sarah] I'm not supposed
to be talking to you.

235
00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.701
How did you even get my number?

236
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.792
You texted me today
to meet you at school.

237
00:14:40.967 --> 00:14:42.751
[Sarah] You texted me!

238
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.796
Sarah. I didn't meet you
until this afternoon.

239
00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:46.450
How would I have your number?

240
00:14:46.798 --> 00:14:48.148
[Sarah] I should hang up.

241
00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:49.801
No. no. no. Sarah.
I need your help.

242
00:14:49.976 --> 00:14:51.716
Okay. you were the last person

243
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.544
to talk to Ruby last night.

244
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.026
[sobs] Not like in person.
We Snapchatted.

245
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:00.638
-What exactly did she say?
- I told you already.

246
00:15:01.291 --> 00:15:02.945
[Tom]
Tell me again.

247
00:15:03.163 --> 00:15:04.468
[Sarah] She said she was
looking for her father.

248
00:15:04.642 --> 00:15:06.079
but he wasn't answering.

249
00:15:06.514 --> 00:15:09.517
Yeah I was out late.
I was. it was really late.

250
00:15:09.691 --> 00:15:11.606
and I didn't hear her message
until this morning.

251
00:15:12.041 --> 00:15:14.304
[Sarah] Could've meant her other
father. She just said father!

252
00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:17.481
I don'’t know which one.
Then she sent me the picture.

253
00:15:17.873 --> 00:15:19.396
I took a screenshot.

254
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.268
Okay. what happened
to the original?

255
00:15:21.485 --> 00:15:23.966
-[Sarah] It-it-it disappeared.
-What?

256
00:15:24.271 --> 00:15:26.055
[Sarah] You know... Snapchat?

257
00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:29.493
Yes. Sarah.
have you told your mum

258
00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:32.148
or the police
about the photograph. about--

259
00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:34.716
[Sarah] God no! Ruby made me
swear never to tell anyone!

260
00:15:35.456 --> 00:15:37.675
And I deleted the picture
like you said.

261
00:15:39.634 --> 00:15:42.724
Sarah. there's a reason
that you confided in me today.

262
00:15:42.898 --> 00:15:45.509
Why you showed me the photo
and no one else.

263
00:15:45.901 --> 00:15:47.816
[Sarah] Because. like.
you'’re her dad.

264
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.036
That's right. I'’m her dad.
I'’m her dad. Sarah.

265
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.515
Now I need your help.

266
00:15:51.689 --> 00:15:54.649
Is there anyone or anywhere

267
00:15:54.823 --> 00:15:56.825
you can think of
that she might be?

268
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.740
[Sarah] I don't want him
to get in trouble.

269
00:15:58.914 --> 00:16:00.176
No one'’s getting in trouble.
Sarah.

270
00:16:00.481 --> 00:16:02.048
She could be with Dario.

271
00:16:02.874 --> 00:16:04.267
Who the fuck is Dario?

272
00:16:04.615 --> 00:16:07.053
-[Sarah] Her boyfriend.
-Boyfriend? She's 12.

273
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.838
-[Sarah] He's older.
-Jesus fucking Christ.

274
00:16:10.012 --> 00:16:11.753
[Sarah] He'’s in grade seven!

275
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:15.800
Okay. give me Dario'’s number.

276
00:16:16.192 --> 00:16:18.238
[Sarah] I... I don't know
if I should.

277
00:16:18.455 --> 00:16:20.370
I'’m supposed to
contact the police if...

278
00:16:20.588 --> 00:16:22.416
Give me Dario'’s number. Sarah.

279
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.635
And then you can call the police
and you can tell them we talked.

280
00:16:24.809 --> 00:16:27.508
All I care about is Ruby
and finding her.

281
00:16:30.293 --> 00:16:32.252
I'’m worried about her. Sarah.

282
00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:35.211
Ruby'’s impulsive. you know.

283
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.172
Like... Like that time. she-she
spray-painted the teacher's car

284
00:16:39.824 --> 00:16:41.174
[Sarah] What?

285
00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:43.785
When he told her she should
smile more. Remember?

286
00:16:44.742 --> 00:16:46.614
[Sarah] That might have been
her old school.

287
00:16:47.963 --> 00:16:49.704
I'’m worried she'’s going
to do something to herself.

288
00:16:49.878 --> 00:16:51.445
That she. that she.
might hurt herself.

289
00:16:53.664 --> 00:16:56.406
[Sarah] Okay.
I texted you Dario'’s number.

290
00:16:57.668 --> 00:16:59.453
Yeah. thank you.
Thank you. Sarah.

291
00:16:59.627 --> 00:17:01.194
[Sarah] Look she...
she wouldn't do that.

292
00:17:01.846 --> 00:17:02.978
What?

293
00:17:03.196 --> 00:17:05.633
[Sarah] You know...hurt herself?

294
00:17:07.896 --> 00:17:09.550
That's not Ruby.

295
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.422

296
00:17:14.816 --> 00:17:16.818

-[Dario on phone] Hello?

300
00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:33.356
Is it...
Is this Dario?

301
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.836
-What?
-Khalid?

302
00:17:35.141 --> 00:17:36.707
Dario? Dario!

303
00:17:36.881 --> 00:17:38.187
[Dario]
I can barely hear you. mate.

304
00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:40.059
Can you turn the music down?

305
00:17:41.582 --> 00:17:44.759
-[Dario] Who is this?
-It's Tom Roth. It's Ruby's dad.

306
00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:46.674
[Dario] Uh. okay.

307
00:17:47.718 --> 00:17:49.111
Now. is Ruby there?

308
00:17:49.372 --> 00:17:52.245
-[Dario] Nah.
-No one's in trouble.

309
00:17:52.419 --> 00:17:54.725
Dario. I just really need you
to put Ruby on the phone. okay?

310
00:17:54.899 --> 00:17:56.640
[Dario] I told ya.
She's not here.

311
00:17:56.814 --> 00:17:57.989
Put her on the fucking phone!

312
00:17:58.164 --> 00:17:59.904
Sorry. Mate. I'’m just...

313
00:18:00.427 --> 00:18:02.255
[exhales]
I'm a bit stressed out. okay?

314
00:18:02.951 --> 00:18:04.431
-[Dario] Alright. Well...
-No. no. no. no. no.

315
00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:05.954
Don't. don'’t hang up.

316
00:18:07.434 --> 00:18:09.175
When was the last time you
spoke to her?

317
00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.786
[Dario] Uh. last night.

318
00:18:12.482 --> 00:18:13.918
And what did she tell you?

319
00:18:14.876 --> 00:18:16.617
[Dario]
It was a private conversation.

320
00:18:18.227 --> 00:18:19.794
Did she tell you
about the photo?

321
00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:21.970
About her. about her stepdad?

322
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.972
[Dario] She told you?

323
00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:27.193
Dario. I just need to know
she's alright okay?

324
00:18:27.367 --> 00:18:29.891
Now. how was she
when you spoke to her?

325
00:18:30.413 --> 00:18:32.894
[Dario] I didn't speak to her.
We texted.

326
00:18:33.895 --> 00:18:37.725
- She was pretty freaked out.
-About him?

327
00:18:37.899 --> 00:18:39.335
[Dario] About the picture
getting out?

328
00:18:39.596 --> 00:18:40.902
Did you see it?

329
00:18:41.207 --> 00:18:43.034
Yeah I saw it.
Tell me you didn'’t!

330
00:18:43.209 --> 00:18:45.254
[Dario] Oh hell. hell no. I told
her not to send it to anyone.

331
00:18:46.734 --> 00:18:48.257
She described it to me.

332
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.651
She was out cold. Mr. Roth.

333
00:18:51.695 --> 00:18:53.654
That fucking rock-spider
dosed her.

334
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:55.830
Yeah. what else?

335
00:18:56.047 --> 00:18:57.048
[Dario] She wanted to see

336
00:18:57.223 --> 00:18:58.572
if it was anywhere online.

337
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.401
-[Dario] If he'’d posted it.
-Oh fuck.

338
00:19:01.575 --> 00:19:02.924
[Dario] And if there was
more than one.

339
00:19:03.098 --> 00:19:04.621
Oh God.

340
00:19:05.187 --> 00:19:06.928
[Dario] I walked her through
the steps of the reverse

341
00:19:07.102 --> 00:19:09.235
image search and
how to locate any EXIF data...

342
00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:11.150
I don't know what any of that
fucking means. mate.

343
00:19:11.411 --> 00:19:13.413
[Dario] It's like
a photograph'’s digital DNA.

344
00:19:13.804 --> 00:19:15.415
What did she find?
Did. did he post it?

345
00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:17.547
[Dario]
She never texted me back.

346
00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.768
Dario. now I don't know. uh...

347
00:19:21.682 --> 00:19:23.771
what Ruby's told you
about our situation.

348
00:19:23.988 --> 00:19:25.120
[Dario] Not a lot.

349
00:19:25.294 --> 00:19:26.600
You're not like. supposed to

350
00:19:26.774 --> 00:19:28.254
see her or something.

351
00:19:28.428 --> 00:19:30.517
She doesn't talk about it much.

352
00:19:31.387 --> 00:19:33.955
Whatever she said. it's uh...
It's complicated.

who did anything to her--

[Dario] Mate. I wanted to shove
a shottie up the creepers ass.

a baker saw a boy steal
a loaf of bread from her shop.

She ran outside. grabbed
the first boy she could find

and said. "You will be whipped
for your crime"

The boy struggled
and cried out. "I am innocent."

to be guilty of something.

00:29:09.878 --> 00:29:11.053
There we are.

530
00:29:12.663 --> 00:29:13.882
Take the next left.

531
00:29:14.056 --> 00:29:15.101
Where?

532
00:29:15.275 --> 00:29:16.493
[The Associate] Now.

533
00:29:17.451 --> 00:29:19.540
[tires screeching]

534
00:29:20.889 --> 00:29:22.412
[The Associate]
Keep on this road.

535
00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:29.506
I want proof
you have my daughter.

536
00:29:32.553 --> 00:29:34.598
Let me talk to my daughter.

537
00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:37.427
Fuck! Talk to me.

538
00:29:37.601 --> 00:29:39.125
Let me hear her.

539
00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:41.388
I want to hear her voice.

540
00:29:41.562 --> 00:29:43.085
[screams]

541
00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:44.957
[The Associate]
Calm yourself. Tom.

542
00:29:46.175 --> 00:29:49.962
These feelings of yours.
while perfectly natural.

543
00:29:50.136 --> 00:29:53.095
are entirely wasted on me.

544
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:57.056
You see. I'm not emotionally
invested in this situation.

545
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.014
In fact. I was called in

546
00:29:59.188 --> 00:30:01.625
specifically
for my impartiality.

547
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.323
Please.

548
00:30:03.497 --> 00:30:05.934
I'm not here to judge anyone.
Tom.

549
00:30:06.108 --> 00:30:08.894
I deal in action
and consequence.

550
00:30:09.503 --> 00:30:10.591
Who are you?

551
00:30:10.765 --> 00:30:12.941
A mediator of sorts.

552
00:30:13.115 --> 00:30:15.465
I told you I was called in.

553
00:30:15.639 --> 00:30:16.771
For what?

554
00:30:16.945 --> 00:30:18.817
To broker a solution.

555
00:30:18.991 --> 00:30:22.429
I'm always called in
when there's a child involved.

556
00:30:22.995 --> 00:30:24.605
Is my daughter there
with you now?

557
00:30:26.259 --> 00:30:27.782
You hurt her
and I'll fucking kill you.

558
00:30:27.956 --> 00:30:29.784
-Turn right. Tom.
-What?

559
00:30:29.958 --> 00:30:33.222
The dirt road on your right.
Turn now.

560
00:30:37.052 --> 00:30:38.401
Stop.

561
00:30:39.315 --> 00:30:41.100
Turn off your engine
and lights.

562
00:30:49.369 --> 00:30:52.285
[distant sirens wailing]

563
00:30:59.292 --> 00:31:00.902
What the fuck.

564
00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:03.557
The police were tracking
your phone. Tom.

565
00:31:03.731 --> 00:31:05.689
And I was tracking the police.

566
00:31:07.778 --> 00:31:10.738
There are multiple moving parts
to these things. Tom.

567
00:31:11.478 --> 00:31:13.436
But rest assured.
I'm monitoring

568
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:16.222
each and every
one of them closely

569
00:31:16.396 --> 00:31:17.876
at all times.

570
00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:19.529
It's what I do.

571
00:31:19.703 --> 00:31:22.054
Very little is left to chance.

572
00:31:24.056 --> 00:31:27.146
I've distracted the police.
You're safe. Tom.

573
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.582
For now.

574
00:31:29.496 --> 00:31:31.324
Don't look so worried.

575
00:31:35.284 --> 00:31:36.720
Fuck.

576
00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:45.207
What are you doing. Tom?

577
00:31:45.381 --> 00:31:47.122
You're wasting valuable time.

578
00:31:47.296 --> 00:31:48.384
Just tell me if Ruby'’s okay.

579
00:31:48.558 --> 00:31:49.995
Your daughter is fine

580
00:31:50.169 --> 00:31:51.735
and resting comfortably.

581
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.650
She's mildly sedated.

582
00:31:53.824 --> 00:31:55.304
Well. then. send me something.

583
00:31:55.478 --> 00:31:57.089
Send me something that proves
she's alive.

584
00:31:57.263 --> 00:31:58.568
What the hell am I supposed
to tell the cops?

585
00:31:59.656 --> 00:32:01.702
Start the engine. Tom.

586
00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:08.404
[engine starting]

587
00:32:16.238 --> 00:32:17.631
Where is she?

588
00:32:17.805 --> 00:32:19.241
What have you done
with my daughter?

589
00:32:21.113 --> 00:32:23.071
You're acting irrationally.
Tom.

590
00:32:23.245 --> 00:32:26.205
Perhaps I wasn't clear earlier
regarding emotions.

591
00:32:26.379 --> 00:32:28.511
They're outside my purview.

592
00:32:36.606 --> 00:32:39.044
[instrumental music]

593
00:32:40.088 --> 00:32:42.612
[The Associate]
Tom. in my experience.

594
00:32:42.786 --> 00:32:44.571
no daughter was ever saved

595
00:32:44.745 --> 00:32:46.834
by her father's rage.

596
00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:03.198
I encourage you
not to speak

597
00:33:03.372 --> 00:33:06.332
but to listen
and follow my instructions.

598
00:33:07.898 --> 00:33:09.944
My transaction
with Shane Bader

599
00:33:10.118 --> 00:33:12.729
was first interrupted
by your daughter.

600
00:33:12.903 --> 00:33:16.907
She arrived unexpectedly
in a highly agitated state.

601
00:33:17.082 --> 00:33:20.476
Shortly thereafter.
you appeared at the house. Tom.

602
00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:24.480
My exchange with Mr. Bader
was terminated.

603
00:33:24.654 --> 00:33:25.960
Ruby was there?

604
00:33:27.309 --> 00:33:29.833
Your daughter was taken
as collateral.

605
00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:32.445
What? What do you want?

606
00:33:32.619 --> 00:33:35.535
I want you to consider
the mistakes you've made

607
00:33:35.709 --> 00:33:37.928
and the consequences. Tom.

608
00:33:38.103 --> 00:33:40.801
I want you to take
responsibility.

609
00:33:41.584 --> 00:33:43.369
I'’ve made a ton of fucking
mistakes.

610
00:33:43.543 --> 00:33:45.414
Take responsibility for what?

611
00:33:46.372 --> 00:33:47.764
Shane Bader.

612
00:33:50.854 --> 00:33:52.378
He got what he deserved.

613
00:33:52.552 --> 00:33:54.554
Nevertheless. Tom.
you're to blame

614
00:33:54.728 --> 00:33:56.599
for our current
predicament.

615
00:33:56.773 --> 00:33:58.819
Surely you'd agree.

616
00:33:58.993 --> 00:34:01.996
After all. it's your mistakes
that led you to this moment.

617
00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:03.998
And to me.

618
00:34:04.172 --> 00:34:06.609
Drive ahead to the
intersection. take a left.

619
00:34:06.783 --> 00:34:08.437
Why should I?

620
00:34:08.611 --> 00:34:10.657
What choice do you have. Tom?

621
00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:12.354
What about my daughter?

622
00:34:13.094 --> 00:34:14.574
That's up to you.

623
00:34:29.371 --> 00:34:30.633
Where am I going?

624
00:34:30.807 --> 00:34:31.939
On your phone

625

-Wait. wait I don'’t understand.
-Keep driving.

and the variables of oxygen
consumption.

was above our garage.

anymore.

Do you honestly think
I'd do anything

707
00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.504
to hurt our little girl?

708
00:37:25.678 --> 00:37:26.940
Are you seriously asking me
that?

709
00:37:27.114 --> 00:37:29.116
You just beat someone to death.

710
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:31.553
[Terri sobbing]

711
00:37:31.727 --> 00:37:33.642
Yeah. I killed the bastard.

712
00:37:33.816 --> 00:37:35.601
I killed him for her. And
I'’d kill him again if I could.

713
00:37:35.775 --> 00:37:37.080
And so would you.

714
00:37:37.777 --> 00:37:39.213
[Terri sobbing]

715
00:37:39.387 --> 00:37:40.693
She'’s our little girl. Tez.

716
00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:42.347
Turn on your video. please.

717
00:37:42.521 --> 00:37:44.436
You need to trust me.
I just need time.

718
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.699
You can't say anything
to anyone. okay?

719
00:37:46.873 --> 00:37:48.135
Especially the cops.

720
00:37:48.962 --> 00:37:52.487
Okay. Okay. But I need you
to promise. Tom.

721
00:37:52.661 --> 00:37:54.446
Promise me you'’re bringing
her home.

722
00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.274
I need you to say it.

723
00:37:57.449 --> 00:37:58.928
God is my witness.

724
00:37:59.102 --> 00:38:01.279
I promise I'm bringing
our daughter home.

725
00:38:03.716 --> 00:38:05.805
[Terri sobbing]

726
00:38:05.979 --> 00:38:07.328

-Incoming call from Unknown.
-Answer.

730
00:38:17.382 --> 00:38:20.080
[The Associate] I'd advise you
to keep the line open. Tom.

731
00:38:20.254 --> 00:38:21.690
Hey. look. I'm juggling
a few balls here. mate.

732
00:38:21.864 --> 00:38:23.779
-I'm doing the best I can.
-Are you?

733
00:38:23.953 --> 00:38:25.999
-I'’m not so sure.
-I did what you asked.

734
00:38:26.173 --> 00:38:29.611
Blaming your ex-wife.
Dragging her into this.

735
00:38:30.351 --> 00:38:32.832
That wasn't what we discussed.
Was it. Tom?

736
00:38:33.702 --> 00:38:34.964
You'’re watching me.

737
00:38:36.052 --> 00:38:37.140
You'’re listening to my calls.

738
00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:38.838
In a sense. yes.

739
00:38:39.447 --> 00:38:41.580
I'm always watching
and listening.

740
00:38:42.102 --> 00:38:44.147
Is it so inconceivable?

741
00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:46.411
It's hardly miraculous
these days.

742
00:38:46.585 --> 00:38:49.065
with the proper technology
and skill set.

743
00:38:49.239 --> 00:38:52.678
one can easily infiltrate
any aspect of a person's life

744
00:38:52.852 --> 00:38:54.462
at any time

745
00:38:54.636 --> 00:38:56.682
That's my specialty. really.

746
00:38:56.856 --> 00:38:58.597
I get to know people.

747
00:38:58.771 --> 00:39:00.903
often better than they know
themselves.

748
00:39:01.077 --> 00:39:02.862
You were at the house.

749
00:39:03.036 --> 00:39:04.211
you were in that car
parked on the street.

750
00:39:04.385 --> 00:39:06.169
I saw you.

751
00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:07.780
Anything's possible.

752
00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:11.174
I have a number of assistants.
Tom.

753
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:12.959
You'd be surprised how many.

754
00:39:13.133 --> 00:39:14.221
What would have happened
if I hadn't shown up?

755
00:39:14.395 --> 00:39:15.440
What would've happened to Ruby?

756
00:39:15.614 --> 00:39:16.963
But you did show up.

757
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.966
Just tell me what I need to do
to get my daughter back.

758
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.229
Knowing would defeat
the purpose. Tom.

759
00:39:22.403 --> 00:39:24.971
Fuck you! Tell me where I'’m
going and what I need to do!

760
00:39:25.928 --> 00:39:28.801
Once again.
I'm a mediator of sorts.

761
00:39:28.975 --> 00:39:32.239
I'm always called in
when there's a child involved

762
00:39:32.413 --> 00:39:35.329
I deal only
in action and consequence.

[Dario]
Mr. Roth?

775
00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:05.925
The police just called.

776
00:40:07.666 --> 00:40:09.015
Fuck me. mate.

777
00:40:09.798 --> 00:40:11.147
Did you tell them I called?

778
00:40:11.321 --> 00:40:12.410
Hell no.

779
00:40:13.759 --> 00:40:15.587
What about the photo.
did you say anything about that?

780
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:17.458
And hand them a bloody motive?

781
00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.505
Mate. that'’s first degree
with intent.

782
00:40:21.636 --> 00:40:23.464
You should say it was
self-defense. Mr. Roth.

783
00:40:23.638 --> 00:40:25.379
It's your word against
a dead guy.

784
00:40:25.553 --> 00:40:27.294
Then I'’ll tell the cops
about the photo.

785
00:40:27.468 --> 00:40:28.904
They'll never convict you
for killing a pedo.

786
00:40:29.078 --> 00:40:30.906
You'll be a bloody legend.
mate!

787
00:40:31.733 --> 00:40:34.214
Trust me. I've listened to a
lot of true crime podcasts

788
00:40:34.388 --> 00:40:36.912
before Mr. Roth. We gotta
get our stories straight.

789
00:40:37.086 --> 00:40:38.566
How old are you. Dario?

790
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.481
Thirteen.

791
00:40:42.352 --> 00:40:44.616
Did you really. you know...

792
00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:48.750
-Yeah. I did.
-And he'’s like. dead. dead?

793
00:40:49.708 --> 00:40:50.970
He is.

794
00:40:51.884 --> 00:40:53.015

Good riddance to him. hey.

797
00:41:00.588 --> 00:41:02.024
The cops said you have Ruby.

798
00:41:02.982 --> 00:41:04.679
What did you say?

799
00:41:04.853 --> 00:41:07.508
Nothing. You and I never spoke.
remember?

800
00:41:08.335 --> 00:41:10.468
-Good.
-You don'’t have her. do ya?

801
00:41:10.642 --> 00:41:12.687
You know I don'’t have her.

802
00:41:12.861 --> 00:41:14.428
Yeah. I figured you would have
called me if you found her.

803
00:41:15.385 --> 00:41:17.562
Or maybe you were
too distracted to call me

804
00:41:17.736 --> 00:41:20.303

you just topped the stepdad.

805
00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:22.610
-Dario.
-Probably just hiding out.

806
00:41:22.784 --> 00:41:24.003
-Listen to me.
- She does...

807
00:41:24.612 --> 00:41:26.005
Someone has her.

808
00:41:28.355 --> 00:41:30.270
Someone's kidnaped Rudy.

809
00:41:30.444 --> 00:41:33.229
-For real. like for ransom?
-Look. I don't have much time.

810
00:41:33.403 --> 00:41:34.753
-What do they want?
-They won'’t say.

811
00:41:34.927 --> 00:41:36.015
But it's got something
to do with the stepdad.

812
00:41:36.189 --> 00:41:37.625
The fucking pedo.

813
00:41:37.799 --> 00:41:39.322
-Something he owes.
-Is Ruby okay?

814
00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:40.585
-Have you spoken to her?
-No. I haven'’t. no.

815
00:41:40.759 --> 00:41:42.282
Ask the kidnapper for proof.

816
00:41:42.456 --> 00:41:43.501
Tell them to send you
video proof.

817
00:41:43.675 --> 00:41:44.806
He sent me some voice message

818
00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.068
from Ruby's phone.

819
00:41:46.242 --> 00:41:47.809
It's her saying she's with me.

820
00:41:47.983 --> 00:41:49.028
It's what he sent to the cops.
mate.

821
00:41:49.202 --> 00:41:49.811
It's a frame up for sure.

822
00:41:50.638 --> 00:41:51.857
I sent it to the cops.

823
00:41:53.859 --> 00:41:56.426
-He made you do it. hey?
-I didn't have a choice.

824
00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:58.211
Look. I don't have much time.

825
00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:01.083
I think he's listening to me.

826
00:42:01.823 --> 00:42:03.521
Listening? Like how?

827
00:42:04.478 --> 00:42:05.740
I think he's watching.

828
00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:09.178
You'’re sounding a little
paranoid. Mr. Roth.

829
00:42:09.352 --> 00:42:10.745
He's bugged me or something.

830
00:42:10.919 --> 00:42:12.791
Oh. you mean like a spy cam.

831
00:42:13.661 --> 00:42:16.011
Has anyone had access
to your car or phone recently?

832
00:42:16.185 --> 00:42:17.970
Dario. I've got to hang up.
I'’ve got to keep the line open.

833
00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:20.450
But I'm going to make it right.
and I'm going to bring her home.

834
00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:22.104
Text me Ruby's message.

835
00:42:22.278 --> 00:42:23.758
The one the kidnapper'’s
sent you.

836
00:42:23.932 --> 00:42:25.499
What for?

837
00:42:25.673 --> 00:42:27.022
Is it a straight up
MP4 or WAV file?

838
00:42:27.196 --> 00:42:28.415
I don'’t fucking know.

839
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:29.982
Let me have a play with it.

840
00:42:30.591 --> 00:42:32.245
If he still has her phone.

841
00:42:32.419 --> 00:42:34.029
I think I might have a way
to hack into it.

842
00:42:34.726 --> 00:42:37.206
If he's tracking you.
maybe I can track him.

843
00:42:38.425 --> 00:42:39.861
You can do that?

844
00:42:40.035 --> 00:42:41.559
I have to try. Mr. Roth.

845
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.126

00:45:07.792 --> 00:45:09.707
Let'’s talk about you. shall we?

883
00:45:09.881 --> 00:45:11.491
[sobbing]

884
00:45:12.492 --> 00:45:14.276
Will it help me get
my daughter back?

885
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:16.801
I'm afraid it's the only way.

886
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:19.934
We can talk while you drive.

887
00:45:20.935 --> 00:45:24.112
Continue east on this road.

888
00:45:24.286 --> 00:45:25.984
Take the first left.

889
00:45:27.855 --> 00:45:30.379
What would you like
to talk about. Tom?

890
00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:33.078
What do you want
in exchange for Ruby?

891
00:45:34.688 --> 00:45:36.995
You're very fond of her.
aren't you?

892
00:45:37.691 --> 00:45:39.519
She's my daughter. isn't she?

893
00:45:39.693 --> 00:45:40.825
You love her.

894
00:45:40.999 --> 00:45:42.609
Of course I fucking love her.

895
00:45:42.783 --> 00:45:45.612
This love you have
for your daughter.

896
00:45:45.786 --> 00:45:47.919
Is it reciprocated?

897
00:45:48.093 --> 00:45:50.225
Daughters love their dads
when they'’re little.

898
00:45:50.399 --> 00:45:51.879
And now?

899
00:45:57.798 --> 00:46:00.714
I see by your employment
history. Tom.

900
00:46:00.888 --> 00:46:04.196
a high turnover of jobs
in a curious variety

901
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:06.241
of unrelated fields.

902
00:46:06.415 --> 00:46:08.330
What can I say.
I get bored easy.

903
00:46:08.504 --> 00:46:11.333
But it appears this pattern
of impulsiveness

904
00:46:11.507 --> 00:46:14.336
extends to all aspects
of your life.

905
00:46:16.556 --> 00:46:19.080
You might be interested to know
that you suffer

906
00:46:19.254 --> 00:46:23.215
an undiagnosed attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder.

907
00:46:24.172 --> 00:46:26.218
You have a condition. Tom.

908
00:46:26.392 --> 00:46:29.134
Great. I wish I'’d known.

909
00:46:29.308 --> 00:46:31.310
It wouldn't have
made any difference.

910
00:46:31.484 --> 00:46:33.225
You are who you are. Tom.

911
00:46:33.399 --> 00:46:35.967
Life is just a series
of choices.

912
00:46:36.141 --> 00:46:38.621
Right. wrong. good. bad.

913
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:41.276
actions and consequences.

914
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:42.887
It's really very simple.

915
00:46:43.061 --> 00:46:44.802
I don't want to talk about me
anymore.

916
00:46:47.065 --> 00:46:48.980
Let's talk about Ruby.

917
00:46:53.375 --> 00:46:55.551
[intense music]

918
00:47:20.185 --> 00:47:22.013
Easy. Tom.

919
00:47:22.187 --> 00:47:24.754
You don't have any points
left on your license.

920
00:47:33.807 --> 00:47:37.289
It's best to accept
the inevitable. Tom.

921
00:47:37.463 --> 00:47:39.682
It's not a matter
of my patience.

922
00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:43.512
I'm enjoying our discussion
and getting to know you.

923
00:47:44.296 --> 00:47:46.994
It's just that
we have so little time.

924
00:47:47.168 --> 00:47:48.866
And this is. if you recall...

925
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.780
A matter of life and death.

926
00:47:50.955 --> 00:47:54.175
Yes. I think we should
get to the point. Tom.

927
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:55.829
Please.

928
00:47:56.003 --> 00:47:58.397
There's a reason
I was called in.

929
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:01.139
There'’s always a reason.

930
00:48:01.791 --> 00:48:03.706
I just want my daughter back.

931
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:07.580
Once you've compensated
for the loss. it's only fair.

932
00:48:08.276 --> 00:48:10.539
Someone has to pay
for Shane Bader.

933
00:48:10.713 --> 00:48:12.367
He got what he deserved.

934
00:48:12.541 --> 00:48:15.066
But you interrupted
a negotiation. Tom.

935
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.286
He and I were in the middle
of a pleasant conversation.

936
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.680
Much like the one
you and I are having.

937
00:48:20.854 --> 00:48:23.161
at this very moment.

938
00:48:23.335 --> 00:48:25.946
He. too. was in a life or death
situation.

939
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.254
the nature of which
I'm not at liberty to reveal.

940
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:34.215
Trust me. These mistakes
happen all the time. Tom.

941
00:48:34.389 --> 00:48:35.521
You're only human.

942
00:48:36.739 --> 00:48:40.613
But the fact remains. Mr. Bader
wasn't yours to judge.

943
00:48:40.787 --> 00:48:42.136
You don'’t know what he did.

944
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.747
You'd be surprised what I know.

945
00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:46.924
Any father would have done
the same.

946
00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:50.231
She's my daughter.

947
00:48:53.104 --> 00:48:54.322
I'm sorry.

948
00:48:54.975 --> 00:48:56.803
Sorry for what. Tom?

949
00:48:57.673 --> 00:48:58.936
Your temper?

950
00:48:59.806 --> 00:49:01.112
Can you blame me?

951
00:49:01.286 --> 00:49:03.505
You are who you are. Tom.

952
00:49:03.679 --> 00:49:07.509
The apportion of blame
is relevant only to actions.

953
00:49:08.162 --> 00:49:10.208
But looking back
over your history

954
00:49:10.382 --> 00:49:13.951
and the events leading
to our discussion today.

955
00:49:14.125 --> 00:49:17.606
I'm afraid your temper
must be viewed as causation.

956
00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.914
My temper wasn't the problem.
It was the drink that did me in.

957
00:49:22.263 --> 00:49:24.178
But I've been sober for years.

958
00:49:24.352 --> 00:49:28.487
Eight years. seven months.
13 days to be exact.

959
00:49:30.532 --> 00:49:33.666
This is the day my wife left me.
and took away my little girl.

960
00:49:35.189 --> 00:49:37.670
She left you because of your
drinking.

961
00:49:38.366 --> 00:49:40.020
When I drank I got mean.

962
00:49:41.195 --> 00:49:45.373
And your sobriety hasn'’t really
resolved your anger issues?

963
00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:47.636
-Has it?
-Not really.

964
00:49:48.898 --> 00:49:51.423
-You'’re still angry?
-Of course I'm fucking angry.

965
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:54.730
I lost my only daughter.
I've lost my kid!

966
00:49:54.904 --> 00:49:56.689
And you blame Shane Bader.

967
00:49:56.863 --> 00:49:58.430
Well. he kept her from me.
didn'’t he?

968
00:49:58.604 --> 00:50:01.563
His actions fall well
within his rights. Tom.

969
00:50:01.737 --> 00:50:04.479
He was after all her legal
custodian.

970
00:50:04.653 --> 00:50:06.003
Not anymore!

971
00:50:08.614 --> 00:50:10.877
I saved her from that sick fuck.

972
00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:14.054
Have you. Tom.
saved your daughter?

973
00:50:14.228 --> 00:50:16.839
Yeah. mate. I did. I saved her
from the unspeakable.

974
00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:19.451
About that photograph. Tom.

975
00:50:20.147 --> 00:50:24.064
No doubt you've considered
the power of that single image.

976
00:50:25.065 --> 00:50:28.199
The havoc it could wreak
on your daughter's innocence.

977
00:50:29.287 --> 00:50:32.203
What if there is
more than one image. Tom?

978
00:50:33.856 --> 00:50:37.077
What if Mr. Bader kept videos?

979
00:50:42.169 --> 00:50:44.345
Anything is possible.

980
00:50:49.437 --> 00:50:52.049
You need to be certain. Tom.

981
00:50:59.012 --> 00:51:00.840
Tell me what to do.

982
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.108
Are you familiar
with Shane Bader'’s office?

983
00:51:10.632 --> 00:51:12.721
It's above his garage.

984
00:51:12.895 --> 00:51:15.115
You need to burn it. Tom.

985
00:51:15.289 --> 00:51:18.423
-Burn down his office?
-The entire garage.

986
00:51:18.597 --> 00:51:20.599
You need to burn it
to the ground.

987
00:51:20.773 --> 00:51:22.644
Like now? It's impossible.

988
00:51:22.818 --> 00:51:26.300
I'll need proof. of course.
A video text is fine.

989
00:51:26.474 --> 00:51:28.215
I can't go back there.
They're waiting for me.

990
00:51:28.389 --> 00:51:31.131
It's the only way to save
your daughter. Tom.

991
00:51:31.305 --> 00:51:33.394
There are still 37 minutes.

992
00:51:33.568 --> 00:51:35.614
What happens if I don'’t make it?
What happens to Ruby?

993
00:51:36.832 --> 00:51:37.920
Ruby dies.

994
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:39.879
[screaming]

995
00:51:42.795 --> 00:51:44.927
Fuck! Fuck!

996
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.799
Fuck.

997
00:51:47.887 --> 00:51:49.889
[sobbing]

998
00:51:58.376 --> 00:52:01.161
[intense music]

999
00:52:22.617 --> 00:52:24.228
[grunts]

1000
00:52:33.976 --> 00:52:35.717
[grunting]

1001
00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:46.206
[The Associate]
You'’re wasting valuable time.

1002
00:52:46.989 --> 00:52:49.166
You need to burn the garage.

1003
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.950
You need to burn it
to the ground.

1004
00:52:51.124 --> 00:52:52.169
Fuck!

1005
00:52:54.388 --> 00:52:55.824
What the fuck?

1006
00:53:01.569 --> 00:53:02.657
Fuck

1007
00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:06.008
Mate. come on!

1008
00:53:06.705 --> 00:53:08.272
Work!

1009
00:53:08.446 --> 00:53:09.751
Fuck!

1010
00:53:21.154 --> 00:53:22.547
Call Terri.

1011
00:53:22.721 --> 00:53:23.983
[automated voice]
Calling Terri.

1012
00:53:24.679 --> 00:53:26.246
-Tom.
-Where are you?

1013
00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.422
I'm at my house. Tom.
Where are you?

1014
00:53:28.596 --> 00:53:29.858
The cops aren'’t fucking around
anymore.

1015
00:53:30.032 --> 00:53:31.599
I can't keep lying to them.

1016
00:53:31.773 --> 00:53:33.210
Put your camera on.
I want to talk to Ruby.

1017
00:53:33.384 --> 00:53:34.515
I told you I'm bringing her
home. okay?

1018
00:53:34.689 --> 00:53:35.908
I gave you my word.

1019
00:53:36.082 --> 00:53:37.126
Oh. your word means shit to me.
Tom.

1020
00:53:37.301 --> 00:53:38.171
Are you near anyone right now?

1021
00:53:38.345 --> 00:53:39.433
Can anyone hear you?

1022
00:53:39.607 --> 00:53:40.652
I'’m on the street. Tom.

1023
00:53:40.826 --> 00:53:42.088
I'’m not a fucking idiot!

1024
00:53:42.262 --> 00:53:43.611
Terri. it's worse than you
think.

1025
00:53:43.785 --> 00:53:45.134
What is?

1026
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:46.745
The shit your pedophile husband
was into.

1027
00:53:46.919 --> 00:53:48.486
The people he'’s dealing with
is bad.

1028
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.052
You're scaring me. Tom.

1029
00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:52.446
I don't have her. Terri.
She's not with me.

1030
00:53:55.841 --> 00:53:57.538
Someone's holding her
for ransom.

1031
00:53:57.712 --> 00:53:59.453
Ransom?

1032
00:53:59.627 --> 00:54:03.979
Someone who's in business
with your husband or was.

1033
00:54:04.153 --> 00:54:06.678
-We need to tell the cops.
-No! No cops.

1034
00:54:06.852 --> 00:54:09.246
Okay? That's his rule.
No one knows besides you and me.

1035
00:54:10.856 --> 00:54:12.249
And Ruby's boyfriend.

1036
00:54:12.423 --> 00:54:14.207
Boyfriend?

1037
00:54:14.381 --> 00:54:16.296
What boyfriend?
Ruby doesn't have a boyfriend.

1038
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:18.211
-Dario.
-Dario?

1039
00:54:18.385 --> 00:54:19.778
The nerdy kid
from down the street?

1040
00:54:19.952 --> 00:54:21.562
Dario.

1041
00:54:21.736 --> 00:54:23.521
You spoke to Dario.
Oh. my God. Tom.

1042
00:54:23.695 --> 00:54:25.436
You're a curse.
You're a fucking...

1043
00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:27.438
-I'm trying to make up for it
-...curse. that's what you are.

1044
00:54:27.612 --> 00:54:29.178
-But I'’m running out of time.
-Curse that will never go away.

1045
00:54:29.353 --> 00:54:30.745
Ask Dario. he'’ll tell you.

1046
00:54:30.919 --> 00:54:32.878
Can you put your camera on?

1047
00:54:33.052 --> 00:54:34.532
I need to see your face.
I've never trusted your voice.

1048
00:54:34.706 --> 00:54:36.055
There'’s more than one photo.

1049
00:54:37.709 --> 00:54:39.276
Maybe even video. Who knows.

1050
00:54:42.322 --> 00:54:45.064
Oh. my God. Our little girl.

1051
00:54:46.195 --> 00:54:48.937
That's what this is about?
They'’re blackmailing us?

1052
00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:50.983
Oh! What do they want. Tom?

1053
00:54:51.157 --> 00:54:52.985
They ordered me to burn down
your husband's office.

1054
00:54:53.159 --> 00:54:54.508
The whole fucking garage.

1055
00:54:54.682 --> 00:54:55.944
They told me to burn it
all down or else...

1056
00:54:56.858 --> 00:54:58.382
Or else what?

1057
00:55:01.646 --> 00:55:03.038
Tom!

1058

Look. we only have 30 minutes.

We have no choice.

1060
00:55:05.998 --> 00:55:07.347
You have to burn down
the garage.

1061
00:55:07.521 --> 00:55:08.566
-Me?
-Yes.

1062
00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.045
Why me?

1063
00:55:10.219 --> 00:55:11.699
-I'm too far away.
-I can'’t.

1064
00:55:11.873 --> 00:55:12.961
I don't know where I am.
I'’ll never get there.

1065
00:55:13.135 --> 00:55:15.007
There'’s cops everywhere.

1066
00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:16.487
-It'’s a fucking crime scene...
-You have to do it. Terri.

1067
00:55:16.661 --> 00:55:18.402
You have to burn down
the garage.

1068
00:55:18.576 --> 00:55:20.012
You have to video it and
you have to text me the video.

1069
00:55:20.186 --> 00:55:21.970
- Why? What's in the garage?
-Photos.

1070
00:55:22.144 --> 00:55:24.016
Everything! The proof of what
he did to our little girl.

[Terri sobbing]

1072
00:55:29.891 --> 00:55:34.026
Um. he keeps
two jerrycans of petrol

1073
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.942
in the garage
for the generator.

1074
00:55:37.116 --> 00:55:38.639
Yeah. yeah. yeah. that'’s it.
Use them. use them.

1075
00:55:38.813 --> 00:55:40.380
I know you can do this.

1076
00:55:41.425 --> 00:55:44.123
I'll do it. I'll burn it down.
I'll burn it.

[Abigail] I can't hold the
police back much longer.

1084
00:56:03.577 --> 00:56:05.492
The cops don't know where I am
or where I'm going

1085
00:56:05.666 --> 00:56:06.667
and neither do I.

1086
00:56:06.841 --> 00:56:07.929
That's the whole point.

1087
00:56:08.103 --> 00:56:09.366
That's the reason I need time.

1088
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.889
[Abigail]
What's the reason. Tom?

1089
00:56:11.237 --> 00:56:12.630
To save Ruby.

[Abigail] Is that
what this is all about?

1091
00:56:14.936 --> 00:56:16.068
Saving Ruby?

1092
00:56:16.242 --> 00:56:17.243
29 minutes.

1093
00:56:17.417 --> 00:56:18.853
I just need 29 minutes.

I'm bringing Ruby home.

No. no. no.
I've sorted out the fire.

1103
00:56:39.918 --> 00:56:41.572
I'm going to text you the video

[The Associate]
We need to talk. Tom.

I had no choice.

1131
00:58:57.229 --> 00:58:58.535
Can I help you?

I've been to a lot of
bottle shops. mate.

this might be a good place

I'd have to agree with you.

We've done a lot of hateful shit
to each other.

there's a lot of respect.

She fucking poisoned
her memory of me.

She made me
into something I'm not.

I am not that guy anymore.

1168

Your plan isn't going to work.

You're going to fail
at your task.

1173

I'm only telling you this

1174
01:00:48.383 --> 01:00:50.342

1190
01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:45.571
that failed you. not me.

1191
01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:49.096
Yeah. I made her do it.
but I didn't have a choice.

1192

Please don'’t take Ruby from me.

1193

Look I did my best!

1194

I tried. trying counts
for something.

1195
01:02:04.677 --> 01:02:05.678
I made the mistake.

1196
01:02:05.852 --> 01:02:07.071
Don't punish Ruby for it.

1197
01:02:07.245 --> 01:02:08.550
Please.

1198
01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:12.598

[The Associate]
It's the only way.

1210
01:02:45.805 --> 01:02:47.807

01:03:58.312 --> 01:03:59.748
Answer.

1227
01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:01.707
[Dario] Mr. Roth?

1228
01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:04.014
It'’s Dario.

1229
01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:09.715
I know because of your. uh.
situation or whatever.

1230
01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:12.674
you don't know your daughter
very well. or like at all.

1231
01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.981
But Ruby takes off
all the time.

1232
01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:17.549
To be alone. or chill.
whatever. that sort of thing.

1233
01:04:17.723 --> 01:04:19.899
And like I've tracked her
phone before.

1234
01:04:20.073 --> 01:04:21.466
I'’ve been at it
ever since I spoke to you.

1235
01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.250
You'’ve tracked my
daughter's phone?

1236
01:04:24.251 --> 01:04:26.123
[Dario] Yeah.
Find my friends.

1237
01:04:26.514 --> 01:04:28.690
I'm not picking up
any signal. Mr. Roth.

1238
01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:30.344
They. they might have
removed the battery

1239
01:04:30.518 --> 01:04:31.955
or put her phone
in a booster bag.

1240
01:04:32.129 --> 01:04:34.000
Nothing at all. That's it?

1241
01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:36.873
[Dario] I don't know anything
about hacking stuff. Mr. Roth.

1242
01:04:37.047 --> 01:04:39.049
Find My Friends
wasn't just my best shot.

1243
01:04:39.266 --> 01:04:40.485
it was my only shot.

1244
01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:42.966
And what about Ruby's message?

1245
01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:44.663
[Dario sobbing]

1246
01:04:45.098 --> 01:04:46.186
[Dario] I heard a train horn
in the background

1247
01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.709
but that could be anywhere.

1248
01:04:49.146 --> 01:04:50.799
I'’m really sorry. Mr. Roth.

1249
01:04:53.454 --> 01:04:55.195
You tried. mate.
Trying counts for something.

1250
01:04:55.413 --> 01:04:56.936
[Dario]
I really wanted to...

1251
01:04:57.502 --> 01:04:59.243
I really wanted it to be me
that found her. Mr. Roth.

1252
01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:01.027
To be the one that.
who saved her.

1253
01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:02.376
Show her I was that guy.

1254
01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:03.508
You know what I mean?

1255
01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:04.596
[Dario sobbing]

1256
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:05.858
I do. mate.

1257
01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.080
I got to go now. Dario.

1258
01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:12.386
[Dario] I failed her. Mr. Roth.

1259
01:05:13.648 --> 01:05:16.042
-We all did.
-Please save her.

1260
01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.478
[Dario] You will. won't you?

1261
01:05:19.089 --> 01:05:20.351
God is my witness.

1262

-Answer.
-Tom. where the hell are ya?

1266
01:05:32.754 --> 01:05:34.234
[Trudy] Benny's been
calling you.

1267
01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:36.149
He got tired of waiting
and fucked off.

1268
01:05:36.845 --> 01:05:39.239
You never fixed the leak
in the flare stack. Tom.

1269
01:05:39.457 --> 01:05:41.502
Benny says you can
smell it from Mercy Road.

1270
01:05:41.676 --> 01:05:43.765
This is a serious
liability issue

1271
01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:46.072
I know you'’re new here.
but mate

1272
01:05:46.246 --> 01:05:49.162
this is the third bloody time
you'’ve stuffed up.

1273
01:05:49.336 --> 01:05:50.685
Benny'’s sacking you. Tom.

1274
01:05:51.295 --> 01:05:52.818
Sorry to be the one
to tell ya.

1275
01:05:53.645 --> 01:05:54.689
We'll need the truck.

Oh. thank Christ.

1278
01:06:07.746 --> 01:06:09.269
I've seen you before.

1279
01:06:09.617 --> 01:06:10.749
I passed you an hour ago.

1280
01:06:10.923 --> 01:06:12.229
You weren'’t the only one. mate.

1281
01:06:12.403 --> 01:06:13.795
It's been hell.

1282
01:06:14.144 --> 01:06:15.188
You were on the other side
of the road there.

1283
01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:17.974
That must have been
a hundred K'’s from here.

1284
01:06:18.539 --> 01:06:19.671
Hey?

1285
01:06:19.845 --> 01:06:21.281
What is this staged?

1286
01:06:21.455 --> 01:06:22.717
What you on about?

1287
01:06:23.631 --> 01:06:25.155
Are you one of his assistants?

1288
01:06:25.329 --> 01:06:27.244
Listen. mate. I've got a flat.

1289
01:06:27.418 --> 01:06:28.462
no spare.
no juice left in my phone.

1290
01:06:28.636 --> 01:06:29.855
I've been out here forever.

1291
01:06:30.116 --> 01:06:31.161
waving for help.
and nobody has stopped.

1292
01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:32.727
Not one.

1293
01:06:33.554 --> 01:06:35.078
People around here are cunts.

1294
01:06:35.556 --> 01:06:36.775
I'm running out of time.
Give it to me.

1295
01:06:37.123 --> 01:06:38.342
Hey?

1296
01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:39.604
I'’m supposed to pick
something up.

1297
01:06:39.778 --> 01:06:41.214
What is it?

1298
01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.390
Do you have anything for me?

1299

[dogs barking at distance]

1300
01:06:47.873 --> 01:06:49.005

Hey!
Hey. call someone.

1302
01:06:54.836 --> 01:06:57.361
Tell them I'’m stranded
on Mercy Road.

1303

You cunt!

1304
01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:01.843
She's my daughter. Terri.

1305

She's my daughter. Terri.
God is my witness.

1308
01:07:13.159 --> 01:07:14.508
I'm bringing her home.

1309

Terri. she'’s my daughter too.

1312
01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:34.485
-[Terri] Stop. Tom. go away.
-[Tom] Give her to me. Terri.

1313

1319
01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:56.985
-Where'’s Terri?
-There's been an accident.

1320
01:07:57.769 --> 01:08:00.163
[Abigail] Two officers saw
somebody in Terri'’s garage--

1321
01:08:00.337 --> 01:08:01.686
Did the garage burn?

1322
01:08:03.601 --> 01:08:04.950
[Abigail] They assumed
it was you and--

1323
01:08:05.124 --> 01:08:07.126
Did the garage burn?
I need to know.

1324
01:08:07.344 --> 01:08:08.693
[Abigail Yes. Tom. it did.

1325
01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:10.912
I don'’t believe you.
send me proof.

1326

[telephone disconnected]

1327
01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:17.093
I fucking did it.

1328
01:08:20.052 --> 01:08:22.794
[The Associate] Time to discuss
compensation. Tom.

1329
01:08:22.968 --> 01:08:24.361
No. Terri. Terri did it.

1330
01:08:24.578 --> 01:08:26.102
I told you she'’d come through.

1331
01:08:26.406 --> 01:08:27.886
I didn't fail you.
I did exactly what you asked.

1332
01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.366
We'’re even.
I swear they're going

1333
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.715
to send me proof any second now.

1334
01:08:30.889 --> 01:08:31.890
[The Associate] There's no need.

1335
01:08:32.064 --> 01:08:33.979
I watched it live. Tom.

1336
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.720
Would you like to see?

I did what you asked.

1346
01:09:03.965 --> 01:09:05.750
[The Associate] Consider your
debt for Mr. Bader

1347
01:09:05.924 --> 01:09:08.056
paid in full. Tom.

1348
01:09:08.231 --> 01:09:11.886
I'’m afraid however.
you now owe for damages.

1349
01:09:12.713 --> 01:09:14.324
You'’re gonna make me
pay for Terri?

1350
01:09:14.672 --> 01:09:17.109
[The Associate] You brought her
into your situation. Tom.

1351
01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:18.371
It's only fair.

1352
01:09:18.545 --> 01:09:21.200
No. not Ruby.
not my daughter.

1353
01:09:21.461 --> 01:09:22.680
Don'’t hurt my daughter.

1354

1355

Someone always has to pay.

1356
01:09:27.467 --> 01:09:28.729
I'’ll pay!

1357
01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.254
Let me be the one who pays.

1358
01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:33.125
[The Associate]
We made a deal. Tom.

1359
01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:34.605
I made a promise.

1360
01:09:36.041 --> 01:09:39.436
[The Associate] I'd like to
propose a new arrangement.

1361
01:09:47.313 --> 01:09:48.488
[The Associate]
Go ahead. Tom.

1362
01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:51.012
Open it.

1363
01:09:57.323 --> 01:10:00.283
-What'’s in there?
-Don't be afraid. Tom.

1364
01:10:02.937 --> 01:10:04.504
[The Associate] Reach inside.

1365
01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:06.724
It won't bite.

1366
01:10:15.863 --> 01:10:17.561
You remember this gun?

1367
01:10:18.997 --> 01:10:20.564
When you bought it?

1368
01:10:21.347 --> 01:10:24.132
Eight years. seven months
and 13 days ago.

1369
01:10:25.656 --> 01:10:26.918
The day I quit drinking.

1370
01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:30.051
In case I couldn'’t hack it.

1371

[The Associate]
Ruby's life or yours. Tom.

1372
01:10:36.014 --> 01:10:38.973
It's the best I can offer
on such short notice.

1373
01:10:44.022 --> 01:10:46.024
[sobbing]

1374
01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:52.378
At least tell me where she is.

1375
01:10:52.552 --> 01:10:54.075
[The Associate] I would text
you a picture.

1376
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.643
but it'’s. too dark.

1377
01:10:57.731 --> 01:10:59.951
Just tell me.
I need to know.

1378
01:11:01.039 --> 01:11:02.997
[The Associate] She's buried
in a shallow grave

1379
01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:05.478
at the base of a macadamia tree

1380
01:11:05.783 --> 01:11:07.872

1382

You need to make
a decision. Tom.

1383
01:11:14.226 --> 01:11:16.315
How will I know
she'’s been set free?

1384
01:11:16.794 --> 01:11:18.056
[The Associate] You won't.

1385
01:11:19.797 --> 01:11:20.972
But I still have 10 minutes.

1386
01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:22.582
[The Associate] I'm sorry. Tom.

1387
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.280
I gave you the benefit
of choice

1388
01:11:24.454 --> 01:11:25.629
in the matter.

1389
01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.500
- It's out of my hands now.
-No.

1390
01:11:28.414 --> 01:11:29.981
[The Associate]  If you'll
excuse me.

1391
01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:32.853
I'm getting called away
to another situation.

1392
01:11:33.027 --> 01:11:35.073
A matter of life or death.

1393
01:11:36.074 --> 01:11:38.946
It's been a pleasure
getting to know you. Tom.

1394
01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:41.209
This concludes
our transaction.

1395

-No. way. way. wait.
