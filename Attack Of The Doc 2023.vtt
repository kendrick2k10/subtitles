Can you hear me now?

8
00:00:51.723 --> 00:00:52.772
His death is
proving to be a rebirth

9
00:00:52.772 --> 00:00:53.705
in comic book sales.

10
00:00:54.538 --> 00:00:56.443
Well. Gary. what Nintendo's sports game

11
00:00:56.443 --> 00:00:57.485
would you like to play?

12
00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:20.754
Remember a time not long ago.

13
00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:24.209
when we came together to
celebrate the things we all loved.

14
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.008
all the things we cared about?

15
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:28.157
I thought it was the best.

16
00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:29.808
It was like the
merging of my tech world.

17
00:01:29.808 --> 00:01:31.695
and the social pop world.
and the movie world.

18
00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:32.528
And it
was really like predicting

19
00:01:32.528 --> 00:01:33.510
where we are now.

20
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.703
There
wasn't anything else

21
00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:35.864
on television like that.

22
00:01:35.864 --> 00:01:37.499
Yes sir. yes man. yes sir.

23
00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:45.656
Jump. Olivia!

24
00:01:48.613 --> 00:01:49.446
Oh shit!

25
00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:03.128
First of all.

26
00:02:03.128 --> 00:02:05.199
if I were to just start
apologizing for the things

27
00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:06.849
that we did wrong 10 years ago.

28
00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:08.356
this show would never end.

29
00:02:10.022 --> 00:02:11.450
I miss doing
"Attack of the Show"

30
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.413
on a daily basis. I. I loved it.

31
00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:14.999
It was like the best time of my life.

32
00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.626
So it's about finding a
new a. a. a place that.

33
00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:20.013
where a network like G4 could live.

34
00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:22.346
And I think it's important
and I would love to watch it.

35
00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:23.961
but for me personally. I miss it.

36
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:25.628
I miss it every day.

37
00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.880
"Attack of the
Show" united all of us into one.

38
00:02:29.713 --> 00:02:30.991
giant. nerdy family.

39
00:02:32.364 --> 00:02:36.214
Ignorance is bliss and it
made for really good TV.

40
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.252
My name is Chris Gore and
if you were a fan of G4 TV.

41
00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:43.902
or "Attack of the Show" back in the day.

42
00:02:43.902 --> 00:02:46.388
you may have a vague memory of who I was.

43
00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:48.304
I was the "DVDuesday" guy.

44
00:02:48.304 --> 00:02:50.127
and I was there from the very beginning.

45
00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:54.869
This is the story of G4 TV
and "Attack of the Show"

46
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:57.847
as told by the people who
work behind the scenes.

47
00:02:57.847 --> 00:02:59.809
and they've got a lot of stories to tell.

48
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.337
Introducing G4.

49
00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:10.552
the next level of network television.

50
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.274
I'm game!

51
00:03:13.107 --> 00:03:15.393
G4 is
the only network dedicated

52
00:03:15.393 --> 00:03:17.511
to the world of interactive entertainment.

53
00:03:17.511 --> 00:03:19.006
Let's bring out the heavy artillery.

54
00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:21.369
And G4 was
really one of the very last

55
00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.549
cable channels ever launched.

56
00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.929
It was the end of this
sort of linear cable era.

57
00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:28.551
before we got to streaming.

58
00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:30.369
and whatever the fuck it is. we watch now.

59
00:03:33.324 --> 00:03:35.117
Pong started on

60
00:03:35.117 --> 00:03:39.021
April 24th. It ran for
seven days. and nights.

61
00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:40.687
Full 24 hours a day.

62
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.411
The very first show on our network

63
00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:47.630
was a show called Blister
about action games.

64
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.918
Hey. I'm Bill Sindelar.

65
00:03:48.918 --> 00:03:50.738
and you are watching Blister
where the action's big.

66
00:03:50.738 --> 00:03:51.906
and my ego is even bigger.

67
00:03:52.906 --> 00:03:56.202
Honestly. the very
early iterations of shows were

68
00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.141
well. let's think about the
different types of video games.

69
00:03:58.141 --> 00:04:01.180
There are action video games.
Okay. that's "Blister".

70
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.957
There are sports video
games. okay. that's "Sweat".

71
00:04:04.957 --> 00:04:08.493
There was a show about
multiplayer games called "Arena".

72
00:04:08.493 --> 00:04:11.101
And so they were just very
generic because nobody knew

73
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:14.464
how to make. at that point.
content about video games.

74
00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:17.381
We were figuring it out as we went.

75
00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:23.284
G4 from 2002 to 2004 was
growing. but it's slow.

76
00:04:24.173 --> 00:04:27.010
In 2002. G4 TV and Tech TV.

77
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.926
were two completely different entities.

78
00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:32.430
Comcast purchased Tech TV.

79
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.680
in order to help boost G4's
viewer base. basically.

80
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.294
Live from the Tech
TV studios in San Francisco.

81
00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:41.794
It's the Screen Savers.

82
00:04:42.836 --> 00:04:45.725
The first email's from Rick.
he says. I'm just curious.

83
00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:50.185
I read that Comcast is going
to buy Tech TV. Is that true?

84
00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:51.722
Yes. it is true.

85
00:04:51.722 --> 00:04:54.068
The sale happened. or
rather. the agreement

86
00:04:54.068 --> 00:04:56.045
happened yesterday.
and then we're waiting.

87
00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:57.816
It takes a couple of months. maybe a month

88
00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:00.275
for regulatory approval.
and at that point.

89
00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:02.918
we'll be merged with G4.
which is their gaming channel.

90
00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:04.246
And uh-

91
00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:05.528
That's pretty much all we know.

92
00:05:05.528 --> 00:05:06.411
That's all we know.

93
00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:07.999
It was definitely
tough on the people

94
00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:09.286
who came from San Francisco.

95
00:05:09.286 --> 00:05:11.347
But as you can see. this
week's ratings are down.

96
00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:15.013
So who's turn is it to be
taken out back and shot?

97
00:05:16.935 --> 00:05:20.482
More people left from
that network than. you know.

98
00:05:20.482 --> 00:05:21.542
G4 when the move happened.

99
00:05:22.436 --> 00:05:25.676
Meanwhile. it was incredibly
positive and happy.

100
00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:28.880
in Southern California.
We all thought. great.

101
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.724
The network's gonna get bigger.

102
00:05:29.724 --> 00:05:31.137
We'll finally be able to be Nielsen rated.

103
00:05:33.192 --> 00:05:35.549
You're using the finest
home entertainment service

104
00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:36.590
available anywhere.

105
00:05:43.617 --> 00:05:45.378
For a while
there. for a few months.

106
00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:47.845
after the purchase. it. the
whole thing was rebranded

107
00:05:47.845 --> 00:05:49.412
G4 Tech TV.

108
00:05:49.412 --> 00:05:52.748
Before it was then rebranded
again to just G4 TV.

109
00:05:54.427 --> 00:05:55.510
Oh! Whoops.

110
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.779
At some. point
post G4 Tech TV becoming G4.

111
00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.594
There was a need to
revamp the Screen Savers.

112
00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:04.199
Ladies and gentlemen and
welcome to the Screen Savers.

113
00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.032
I'm Patrick-

114
00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.227
There was an internal contest.

115
00:06:07.227 --> 00:06:09.902
to think of a new name for the show.

116
00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:11.615
And they had asked everybody.

117
00:06:11.615 --> 00:06:14.503
and that was one of the beautiful
things about that network.

118
00:06:14.503 --> 00:06:16.961
Anybody can have a good
idea. If they love the show.

119
00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.459
if they love what it stands for.

120
00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:23.118
then their creative
output could be the thing

121
00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:27.524
that is the linchpin into
where the show goes next.

122
00:06:27.524 --> 00:06:29.781
or what that iconic name could be.

123
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:32.866
If I recall the prize for

124
00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:37.172
coming up with the new name
was. uh. like an iPod Video.

125
00:06:37.172 --> 00:06:39.736
maybe an iPod nano. This was. you know.

126
00:06:39.736 --> 00:06:40.844
it was a different time.

127
00:06:40.844 --> 00:06:42.794
I was working with
Mike Shaw at the time.

128
00:06:42.794 --> 00:06:46.230
I remember him kind of
spit-balling all these ideas.

129
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.480
and then he ended up coming
up with this manifesto.

130
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.933
And I might be
remembering this wrong.

131
00:06:53.933 --> 00:06:56.232
but I feel like Mike
Shaw stood up and read it

132
00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:58.807
with this passionate. we're not football.

133
00:06:58.807 --> 00:07:00.255
we're Lord of the Rings.

134
00:07:00.255 --> 00:07:02.344
And it just hit the nail on the head.

135
00:07:02.344 --> 00:07:04.373
I get emotional just talking about it.

136
00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:06.853
because I'm like. yes. yes. that's it.

137
00:07:06.853 --> 00:07:08.811
That's who we are.

138
00:07:10.582 --> 00:07:12.415
Pick up on this.

139
00:07:23.544 --> 00:07:27.332
♪ Attack ♪

140
00:07:27.332 --> 00:07:29.247
♪ Attack of the Show ♪

141
00:07:29.247 --> 00:07:31.969
♪ Attack ♪

142
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:34.326
But there was something
about "Attack of the Show".

143
00:07:34.326 --> 00:07:37.636
exclamation point. that
felt very much like

144
00:07:37.636 --> 00:07:39.364
what we were trying to go for.

145
00:07:39.364 --> 00:07:40.369
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

146
00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:41.202
Why'd you go?

147
00:07:41.202 --> 00:07:42.035
No you were supposed to-

148
00:07:42.035 --> 00:07:44.281
And what the founding
fathers of the network

149
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:47.100
were trying to go for something
unique. something different.

150
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.668
something a little meta.

151
00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:51.876
Something that was going
to kind of turn the mirror

152
00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:55.854
back onto pop culture and
kind of spit in its face.

153
00:07:55.854 --> 00:07:58.053
but. but then wipe it
off and give you a kiss

154
00:07:58.053 --> 00:07:59.626
at the same time.

155
00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:01.424
Oh yes.

156
00:08:01.424 --> 00:08:02.434
Sharon.

157
00:08:02.434 --> 00:08:04.379
God. I love you.

158
00:08:09.672 --> 00:08:10.505
Hey man.

159
00:08:10.505 --> 00:08:12.566

160
00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:16.080

all. Dude. that's ridiculous.

161
00:08:17.202 --> 00:08:19.493
Uh. look man. I really need a favor.

162
00:08:19.493 --> 00:08:21.658
Oh. you're here to
interview me for the doc.

163
00:08:21.658 --> 00:08:22.878
Yes. I knew you'd come by.

Well. uh. okay. so what's up?

170
00:08:35.465 --> 00:08:38.510
I could really use some songs.

Yeah. all right.

172
00:08:42.012 --> 00:08:42.845

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.886
The first time I
remember meeting Kevin Pereira.

182
00:09:10.886 --> 00:09:15.477
I think he was an intern on a
show that was awkwardly titled

183
00:09:16.581 --> 00:09:17.539
G4 TV.com.

184
00:09:17.539 --> 00:09:19.943
Kevin was my
assistant. he was my PA.

185
00:09:19.943 --> 00:09:22.191
I once
was a PA at the network.

186
00:09:22.191 --> 00:09:23.848
getting balance bars and coffee.

187
00:09:23.848 --> 00:09:26.232
And then one day in the
lunchroom. an executive producer

188
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.023
for another show called "Arena".

189
00:09:28.023 --> 00:09:30.688
asked me if I had any
interest in being on camera.

190
00:09:30.688 --> 00:09:32.978
And I looked around and I didn't
see a couch. it felt safe.

191
00:09:32.978 --> 00:09:33.811
And I said. yes.

192
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:35.598
I think you're gonna
be the best host ever.

193
00:09:35.598 --> 00:09:36.431
Really?

194
00:09:36.431 --> 00:09:37.363
You really got it kid.

195
00:09:37.363 --> 00:09:38.605
Wow. Thanks Sarah. I appreciate it.

196
00:09:38.605 --> 00:09:39.438
Have a good day.

197
00:09:39.438 --> 00:09:40.271
Yeah. I will. You too.

198
00:09:40.271 --> 00:09:41.104
All right.

199
00:09:41.104 --> 00:09:41.937
All right.

200
00:09:41.937 --> 00:09:43.224
Awesome. Yeah.

201
00:09:43.224 --> 00:09:44.408
Yeah. it's gonna be great.

202
00:09:44.408 --> 00:09:46.180
He was doing
some internet radio show

203
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.659
that had a little bit of a following.

204
00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:49.276
that might be how Scott found him.

205
00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.316
And so I'm sitting there

206
00:09:50.316 --> 00:09:52.716
and while I'm using my
little Johnson baby shampoo.

207
00:09:52.716 --> 00:09:55.148
some gets in my eyes and
although it says no tears

208
00:09:55.148 --> 00:09:57.276
on the bottle. let me
tell you that stuff burns.

209
00:09:57.276 --> 00:09:58.828
Okay? My eyes were red.

210
00:09:59.778 --> 00:10:01.486
You have to work as a team here
to survive here in "Arena".

211
00:10:01.486 --> 00:10:02.319
Well. team-

212
00:10:02.319 --> 00:10:05.292
There was some sort
of issue with Wil Wheaton.

213
00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:07.057
and the other host of "Arena."

214
00:10:07.057 --> 00:10:08.204
Trying to say is that they-

215
00:10:08.204 --> 00:10:09.037
Okay "Campy McCamp Camp".

216
00:10:09.037 --> 00:10:10.565
You know what? Maybe I should camp you.

217
00:10:10.565 --> 00:10:14.045
All right go ahead. why
don't you do that camper.

218
00:10:14.045 --> 00:10:15.398
I'm going to watch the pirate ship sink.

219
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:17.064
Why don't you do that.

220
00:10:17.064 --> 00:10:19.005
Kevin ended up Hosting "Arena".

221
00:10:19.005 --> 00:10:22.869
which was this sort of LAN
party competitive gaming show.

222
00:10:22.869 --> 00:10:25.897
It was just really clear that
even though he was young.

223
00:10:25.897 --> 00:10:27.801
even though he couldn't
grow a real mustache.

224
00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:30.729
he was super talented and super witty.

225
00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:33.713
and it kind of didn't matter
what you wrote in the script

226
00:10:33.713 --> 00:10:35.106
because he was just gonna go.

227
00:10:35.106 --> 00:10:35.939
I've been really sick.

228
00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:37.485
I still am a little bit.
So there will be phlegm.

229
00:10:37.485 --> 00:10:39.036
I promise at some point in the show today.

230
00:10:39.036 --> 00:10:39.869
Neat.

231
00:10:39.869 --> 00:10:40.702
Perhaps it might land on you.

232
00:10:40.702 --> 00:10:41.535
Neat.

233
00:10:41.535 --> 00:10:42.460
Sarah. if you're lucky.

234
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.399
He had always wanted
to be on camera and you know.

235
00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.814
rightfully so. he's good on camera.

236
00:10:45.814 --> 00:10:46.647
Bye kids.

237
00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:49.115
And our
director at the time said.

238
00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:51.455
we can never put that kid on camera.

239
00:10:51.455 --> 00:10:54.435
He was scrawny and his jawline wasn't. uh.

240
00:10:54.435 --> 00:10:56.573
he looked like a little tiny kid. right?

241
00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.620
And he just wasn't the
image of male hunk-ness

242
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.056
that your typical host or
television personality would have.

243
00:11:03.056 --> 00:11:05.892
So. clearly that director
has since been proven wrong.

244
00:11:05.892 --> 00:11:07.533
since Kevin did get his shot on camera.

245
00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:08.366
and he did great at it.

246
00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:10.032
Who the hell is that d-bag?

247
00:11:10.032 --> 00:11:11.385
Welcome to the "Console Pit".

248
00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:13.104
We're about to get it on in "Burnout 2".

249
00:11:13.104 --> 00:11:15.333
Oh nice molester stash. Yeah. that's it.

250
00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:17.546
Oh. and a Canadian tuxedo.

251
00:11:17.546 --> 00:11:19.149
Real classy.

252
00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:20.607
I honestly don't remember

253
00:11:20.607 --> 00:11:23.657
if he had the mustache
when I was with him.

254
00:11:23.657 --> 00:11:25.603
You said. oh look at the mustache.

255
00:11:26.634 --> 00:11:28.480
Well the mustache is the best part.

256
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.079
He was a TV host.

257
00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:33.250
who was also a production
assistant on another show.

258
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.177
which on the one hand is like insulting.

259
00:11:36.177 --> 00:11:37.835
but on the other hand is like.

260
00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:40.205
that's kind of how G4 was that time.

261
00:11:40.205 --> 00:11:41.623
I was just impressed as hell

262
00:11:41.623 --> 00:11:43.770
that he was finding a path as a career

263
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.391
in this space. so
efficiently and so quickly.

264
00:11:47.391 --> 00:11:48.651
and just impressed by his talent.

265
00:11:48.651 --> 00:11:50.389
Guy was good mustache or not.

266
00:11:51.222 --> 00:11:52.055
Oh!

267
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.485
What?

268
00:11:54.485 --> 00:11:57.742
Kevin. you do know who that is. right?

269
00:11:57.742 --> 00:11:59.978
Let's let the fur fly
in Unreal Tournament.

270
00:11:59.978 --> 00:12:02.271
Yeah. it's. uh. it's Shia LaBeouf.

271
00:12:02.271 --> 00:12:03.104
The Transformers kid.

272
00:12:03.104 --> 00:12:04.073
No. it's you.

273
00:12:04.073 --> 00:12:05.167
That's not-

274
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.258
Shut. shut up. get outta of here.

275
00:12:08.091 --> 00:12:09.587
Close. close the door.

276
00:12:09.587 --> 00:12:10.988
Lots of lead punishment.

277
00:12:10.988 --> 00:12:11.821
It is me

278
00:12:11.821 --> 00:12:12.654
So
let's get to the action.

279
00:12:12.654 --> 00:12:14.409
and see what happens in "SOCOM 2".

280
00:12:14.409 --> 00:12:15.242
Kinda hot.

281
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:18.308
Kevin Pereira was
basically the Bugs Bunny

282
00:12:18.308 --> 00:12:21.825
of "Attack of the Show". He was
there to disrupt everything.

283
00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.576
You know. right before we went live.

284
00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.251
I'd hear a three. two. one. go.

285
00:12:25.251 --> 00:12:28.686
And Kevin had just shown
me "Two Girls. One Cup".

286
00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.464
and I have a horrified look on my face.

287
00:12:31.464 --> 00:12:35.092
Sarah Lane
came into my office and said.

288
00:12:35.092 --> 00:12:36.848
"I don't think I want to do this anymore.

289
00:12:36.848 --> 00:12:38.560
I'm kind of burnt out".

290
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.496
And I said. "Okay. give me enough time

291
00:12:40.496 --> 00:12:42.026
to find someone to replace you.

292
00:12:42.026 --> 00:12:43.991
and then we'll just get you out of this".

293
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:48.723
So my friend sent me a
series of VHS resume tapes.

294
00:12:48.723 --> 00:12:51.729
and one of them with the
name Lisa Munn on it.

295
00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:55.061
included a young woman who was shown doing

296
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:57.661
sideline reporting from
the University of Oklahoma

297
00:12:57.661 --> 00:13:01.094
football games. And as it turns
out. that was Olivia Munn.

298
00:13:01.094 --> 00:13:04.110
Olivia had just done a show
called "Beyond the Break"

299
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.808
in a small role about
surfer girls in Hawaii.

300
00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:11.188
Other than that. she had
no credits whatsoever.

301
00:13:11.188 --> 00:13:14.086
I took Lisa Munn. who now Olivia Munn.

302
00:13:14.086 --> 00:13:17.042
and about a dozen other candidates

303
00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:21.489
and brought them in and Kevin
did a 10 minute sequence

304
00:13:21.489 --> 00:13:23.525
of "Attack of the Show" with each of them.

305
00:13:23.525 --> 00:13:26.640
And there were many who were
not right for it at all.

306
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.620
Whitney Cummings. as a matter of fact.

307
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.593
was one of the people who
came in and auditioned.

308
00:13:31.593 --> 00:13:34.630
Everyone loved her. she was incredible.

309
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.505
There was no one better
than Whitney Cummings

310
00:13:37.505 --> 00:13:40.072
until Olivia Munn came on set.

311
00:13:41.077 --> 00:13:41.910
Hello everybody.

312
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.743
welcome to "Attack of the Show".

313
00:13:42.743 --> 00:13:43.941
It's Monday. April 10th.

314
00:13:43.941 --> 00:13:46.761
I'm Kevin Pereira and I am
honored. It is a privilege.

315
00:13:46.761 --> 00:13:48.913
to welcome our new co-host because it.

316
00:13:48.913 --> 00:13:49.991
it says it right there on the prompter.

317
00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:51.114
I had a little trouble sounding it out.

318
00:13:51.114 --> 00:13:53.458
Olivia Munn. ladies and
gentlemen. come on now.

319
00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:55.814
Olivia brought
a lot to that show.

320
00:13:55.814 --> 00:13:57.686
She brought her voice.
she brought her attitude.

321
00:13:57.686 --> 00:13:58.548
she brought her energy.

322
00:13:58.548 --> 00:14:00.917
Hello Governors.

323
00:14:00.917 --> 00:14:02.334
I am Olivia Munn.

324
00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:11.073
I'll be playing the part
of Strawberry Field.

325
00:14:11.073 --> 00:14:14.435
She was relatively
unknown but was like. so pro.

326
00:14:14.435 --> 00:14:16.028
Hi everybody. I'm Olivia Munn.

327
00:14:16.028 --> 00:14:18.425
and I know that Kevin and Chris
are hosting the show today.

328
00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:21.215
so it might be missing a feminine touch.

329
00:14:21.215 --> 00:14:23.965
So I thought I'd inject a
little femininity into the show.

330
00:14:23.965 --> 00:14:25.945
So here you go.

331
00:14:25.945 --> 00:14:27.122
Vagina. vagina. vagina.

332
00:14:27.122 --> 00:14:29.573
Kevin's mom's vagina. Kevin's
vagina. coochie. vagina.

333
00:14:29.573 --> 00:14:31.572
My vagina is a little
itchy right now. Vagina.

334
00:14:31.572 --> 00:14:33.096
Thanks. vagina. Bye.

335
00:14:33.096 --> 00:14:35.724
She sold everything
that we wrote for her.

336
00:14:35.724 --> 00:14:37.688
She delivered amazingly.

337
00:14:40.743 --> 00:14:41.576
No-

338
00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:44.371
They smell really fresh and

339
00:14:45.204 --> 00:14:46.636
musty. Okay cool!

340
00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.193
I watched
in these rehearsals

341
00:14:48.193 --> 00:14:50.789
where Olivia held her own
and came up with things

342
00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:54.137
that were just as crazy as
what they were suggesting.

343
00:14:54.137 --> 00:14:55.464
She wasn't
really afraid of much.

344
00:14:55.464 --> 00:14:57.189
but she was afraid of snakes and I. I.

345
00:14:57.189 --> 00:15:00.036
I believe there was one
episode where we had her lay

346
00:15:00.036 --> 00:15:02.382
on the couch and we dumped
a bunch of snakes on her.

347
00:15:02.382 --> 00:15:05.325
and I. I just remember being like. wow.

348
00:15:06.409 --> 00:15:07.303
Munn. I'm proud of you.

349
00:15:07.303 --> 00:15:08.553
That's. that took. that
took some guts. come on.

350
00:15:09.386 --> 00:15:10.219
Kevin. uh.

351
00:15:10.219 --> 00:15:11.052
Olivia Munn.

352
00:15:11.052 --> 00:15:12.385
She's really
ready to do anything

353
00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:14.689
to make sure this show is successful.

354
00:15:15.683 --> 00:15:18.359
Drop the muffin.

355
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:22.146
Hi. I'm Wonder Woman.

356
00:15:22.146 --> 00:15:23.526
Superhero.

357
00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:24.710
celebrity.

358
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.277
and your guide to office safety.

359
00:15:28.943 --> 00:15:30.796
There's something
that that can be said about

360
00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:35.796
when you know that someone has
it. that star quality thing.

361
00:15:39.547 --> 00:15:41.898
And she had great
chemistry with Kevin on camera.

362
00:15:41.898 --> 00:15:44.647
They were such a great team.

363
00:15:44.647 --> 00:15:45.605
Yes. bigger.

364
00:15:45.605 --> 00:15:46.438
Oh.

365
00:15:46.438 --> 00:15:48.021
What is it? How is that gonna
get attention. There we go.

366
00:15:48.854 --> 00:15:49.687
Work them dollars.

367
00:15:49.687 --> 00:15:52.487
I think initially. Olivia was

368
00:15:52.487 --> 00:15:56.247
trying her hardest to get a sense of the

369
00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.975
workings of the show.

370
00:15:57.975 --> 00:16:00.372
Camera turning where to.
you know. sort of be.

371
00:16:00.372 --> 00:16:02.793
Like when she could chime in and do a bit.

372
00:16:02.793 --> 00:16:04.976
How she could get a
reaction from a camera.

373
00:16:04.976 --> 00:16:06.526
She's like. "What are you
doing? I love you so much.

374
00:16:06.526 --> 00:16:07.484
why are you cheating on
me? With that girl with-

375
00:16:07.484 --> 00:16:08.317
Hey camera guy.

376
00:16:08.317 --> 00:16:09.448
you're only encouraging this crap.

377
00:16:10.282 --> 00:16:14.465
Stop with the slow push
and cut to Pereira.

378
00:16:14.465 --> 00:16:15.298
Thank you.

379
00:16:16.131 --> 00:16:18.714
Now. just because epic- Oh man.

380
00:16:25.658 --> 00:16:27.329
You know. just because Epic April is over.

381
00:16:27.329 --> 00:16:30.090
it doesn't mean we still
don't get unnecessarily angry

382
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.447
about things. Right Olivia?

383
00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:35.752
Yeah. I
mean she's a great actress.

384
00:16:35.752 --> 00:16:36.585
That's right.

385
00:16:36.585 --> 00:16:38.050
But she
is a brilliant comedian.

386
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.348
and that's why she was able
to hold her own with Kevin.

387
00:16:40.348 --> 00:16:42.470
'cause she can play blue
just as much as him.

388
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.307
Olivia. um. Even. I
don't know where that's been.

389
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.119
I don't swallow with Kevin.

390
00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:56.307
And Kevin was trying
to figure out. you know.

391
00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:58.220
what can I get away with.

392
00:17:03.431 --> 00:17:05.417
Dudes just want to have sex with them.

393
00:17:06.927 --> 00:17:07.868
Really terribly.

394
00:17:07.868 --> 00:17:08.701
Ah.

395
00:17:09.534 --> 00:17:10.367
Oh my God!

396
00:17:10.367 --> 00:17:11.200
And it was amazing because

397
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.943
it would just be a fun
game for them to see.

398
00:17:12.943 --> 00:17:15.636
what troll-y joke can I just slip in here?

399
00:17:15.636 --> 00:17:18.834
There's your special edition
right there. Chris Gore.

400
00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.170
I just. I just realized the forum trap

401
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.009
of the animated gif of this.

402
00:17:25.948 --> 00:17:28.457
He's you
know. naturally so gifted

403
00:17:28.457 --> 00:17:31.335
at just going. and going. and going.

404
00:17:31.335 --> 00:17:32.590
There's a release.

405
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.364
Come here buddy! Who's my buddy? Who's my-

406
00:17:35.372 --> 00:17:36.205
Sony 3.1.

407
00:17:37.038 --> 00:17:37.871
Oh shit!

408
00:17:41.146 --> 00:17:43.053
Oh God. that felt so good.

409
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.841
Kevin. are you okay?

410
00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:56.674
Fantastic.

411
00:17:57.507 --> 00:17:59.820
That had to hurt.
Kevin. you hit your head.

412
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.059
Do you know if. when
you bleed internally.

413
00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:03.767
I had heard
about Kevin a little bit

414
00:18:03.767 --> 00:18:06.607
from Jim Downs and from Scott Rubin.

415
00:18:06.607 --> 00:18:08.309
You know. like. oh there's
this kid that we're bringing in

416
00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:10.421
now that is a little on the green side.

417
00:18:10.421 --> 00:18:13.529
but he's got a lot of passion.
He obviously knows his shit.

418
00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:15.042
A storm is coming.

419
00:18:15.042 --> 00:18:17.333
Oh. just stop doing that.

420
00:18:17.333 --> 00:18:19.011
There was something so exciting

421
00:18:19.011 --> 00:18:22.520
about watching the onscreen
talent evolve on camera.

422
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.353
Oh my God.

423
00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:24.486
Yeah. Yeah.

424
00:18:24.486 --> 00:18:27.298
Watching someone
who truly had. you know.

425
00:18:27.298 --> 00:18:29.730
very little experience
in the. in that field.

426
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.642
and being on camera like
that and being the voice

427
00:18:32.642 --> 00:18:35.559
of a network. because Kevin was us.

428
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:37.403
These are terrible.

429
00:18:37.403 --> 00:18:39.311
These are like. these are
the worst things ever.

430
00:18:39.311 --> 00:18:41.497
ATM breaking. monkey washes cat.

431
00:18:41.497 --> 00:18:44.116
We didn't come up with
these. some set designer did.

432
00:18:44.949 --> 00:18:47.512
"OMGROFLOL!" has now become
an inside joke for our show.

433
00:18:47.512 --> 00:18:49.112
It's one of the worst things ever.

434
00:18:49.112 --> 00:18:50.874
And then Gadget Pron.
Reviews of latest gadgets

435
00:18:50.874 --> 00:18:53.899
and latest and greatest tech. Really?

436
00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:55.584
Okay. They're watching
the show. They get it.

437
00:18:55.584 --> 00:18:57.304
Kevin.
he had all of this stuff.

438
00:18:57.304 --> 00:18:58.944
but it was also kind of. you know.

439
00:18:58.944 --> 00:19:02.336
subversive 4Chan dark comedy.
you know. kind of stuff.

440
00:19:02.336 --> 00:19:04.830
which was great. It was always
really good for big laughs.

441
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.394
You have an increased
risk of becoming bipolar.

442
00:19:07.394 --> 00:19:09.682
Guess what. Munn? Didn't need
a DNA test to tell me that.

443
00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:10.515
Psycho!

444
00:19:11.348 --> 00:19:12.259
And she'd
come up with something

445
00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:13.367
even better.

446
00:19:13.367 --> 00:19:15.393
Can't detect sweat. smell very well.

447
00:19:15.393 --> 00:19:17.343
And that's fair because
if you're around him.

448
00:19:17.343 --> 00:19:19.956
as you boys are. he smells like poop.

449
00:19:19.956 --> 00:19:22.373
He's also more susceptible
to getting AIDs.

450
00:19:22.373 --> 00:19:23.568
Wrap that little thing up.

451
00:19:23.568 --> 00:19:24.401
What? Oh come on!

452
00:19:25.234 --> 00:19:26.067
Wrap it up!

453
00:19:26.067 --> 00:19:27.802
I think
the Cholula incident

454
00:19:27.802 --> 00:19:28.973
tells you everything you need to know

455
00:19:28.973 --> 00:19:30.058
about that relationship.

456
00:19:30.058 --> 00:19:31.115
Our Lady of Cholula.

457
00:19:31.115 --> 00:19:31.948
Mmhmm.

458
00:19:31.948 --> 00:19:32.781
Oh my gosh!

459
00:19:32.781 --> 00:19:34.145
Oh Cholula!

460
00:19:34.145 --> 00:19:34.978
Woo!

461
00:19:34.978 --> 00:19:35.811
Let's get to it.

462
00:19:35.811 --> 00:19:36.800
You know.
in rehearsals we thought

463
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.332
it was literally gonna go like two shots.

464
00:19:39.332 --> 00:19:40.518
and that Olivia will give up.

465
00:19:42.109 --> 00:19:42.942
Woo!

466
00:19:42.942 --> 00:19:44.283
Well Kevin kept pushing it.

467
00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:45.492
He said. "Well I'm gonna do another one.

468
00:19:45.492 --> 00:19:46.528
because I wanna make her do another one.

469
00:19:46.528 --> 00:19:48.320
Three! Three! Three! Three!

470
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.526
And then she did another one.

471
00:19:49.526 --> 00:19:51.312
and I think it ended up being eleven.

472
00:19:51.312 --> 00:19:52.145
Ah!

473
00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.012
The two
of them spent the night

474
00:19:54.012 --> 00:19:55.211
on the toilet.

475
00:19:55.211 --> 00:19:57.811
I've been doing
broadcast for over 25 years.

476
00:19:57.811 --> 00:19:59.394
I've been in a lot of places.

477
00:19:59.394 --> 00:20:01.916
and seen a lot of co-hosts and stuff.

478
00:20:01.916 --> 00:20:04.954
And I don't recall a time where there was

479
00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:08.463
an instant chemistry like
with Olivia and Kevin.

480
00:20:08.463 --> 00:20:09.982
Do you want me to hit
you? Because I will hit you.

481
00:20:09.982 --> 00:20:12.134
I'll hit you live on TV.
with your parents watching.

482
00:20:12.134 --> 00:20:14.384
That would not be nice.
because maybe some of that

483
00:20:14.384 --> 00:20:15.217
cornstarch would come
out of your hair and get-

496
00:20:40.396 --> 00:20:43.788
When they brought
Chris Gore into the fold

497
00:20:43.788 --> 00:20:46.626
as part of "Attack of the
Show". to me as a huge fan

498
00:20:46.626 --> 00:20:49.652
of transgressive cinema
and punk rock film.

499
00:20:49.652 --> 00:20:51.226
that to me was a vote of confidence.

500
00:20:51.226 --> 00:20:54.801
Time to recline the
La-Z-Boy. It's "DVDuesday".

501
00:20:59.535 --> 00:21:01.347
Welcome back our film
expert. Chris Gore.

502
00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.263
Thank you.

503
00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:04.442
Thank you folks.

504
00:21:04.442 --> 00:21:07.537
I loved doing
"DVDuesday" and the "Rapid Fire".

505
00:21:07.537 --> 00:21:09.539
"Longest Yard".
Best football movie ever.

506
00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:11.462
You've got "Slap Shot". Best hockey-

507
00:21:11.462 --> 00:21:12.744
This was the segment where Chris

508
00:21:12.744 --> 00:21:15.591
had to review a stack
of DVDs in about like.

509
00:21:15.591 --> 00:21:17.494
I think it was 30 seconds or a minute.

510
00:21:17.494 --> 00:21:20.930
And he would give like a quick
review of a movie and then

511
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.550
toss the DVD cover and
move on to the next one.

512
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.003
And it was always fun to
watch him fumble through it.

513
00:21:26.003 --> 00:21:27.853
and do as many as he could.

514
00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:29.756
Sometimes he was able to
go through the stacks.

515
00:21:29.756 --> 00:21:33.466
Sometimes he. he wasn't.
but always fun to watch.

516
00:21:33.466 --> 00:21:36.268
And then from there
the wheels were off the bus.

517
00:21:36.268 --> 00:21:37.223
You can get another light bulb. right?

518
00:21:37.223 --> 00:21:38.056
Eh.

519
00:21:38.056 --> 00:21:38.889
Yeah. No big deal. Check it out.

520
00:21:39.722 --> 00:21:41.188
Whoa. That's cool.

521
00:21:41.188 --> 00:21:42.202
And it's on fire.

522
00:21:42.202 --> 00:21:44.361
It's actually on fire now.
which is. well blog it.

523
00:21:44.361 --> 00:21:47.173
Any wacky idea.
we could see if it sticks.

524
00:21:47.173 --> 00:21:48.498
Yeah. I noticed the. the arrow looks

525
00:21:48.498 --> 00:21:49.389
reversed here for some reason.

526
00:21:49.389 --> 00:21:50.222
Well. it is.

527
00:21:50.222 --> 00:21:51.115
And that can cause tire damage. right?

528
00:21:51.115 --> 00:21:54.043
You know. this
small server is gonna go

529
00:21:54.043 --> 00:21:57.068
past these little muscles
and rest for a small period

530
00:21:57.068 --> 00:21:59.517
of time up here in the
lower part of the colon.

531
00:21:59.517 --> 00:22:01.856
How come I don't hear the theme from

532
00:22:01.856 --> 00:22:03.042
"2001: A Space Odyssey?"

533
00:22:03.042 --> 00:22:03.875
Oh man.

534
00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:04.708
Oh. what is going on?

535
00:22:04.708 --> 00:22:05.861
That doesn't feel right.

536
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:07.748
What
is going on right now?

537
00:22:07.748 --> 00:22:09.600
And we're we're as
far as we need to be today.

538
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.058
That's perfect.

539
00:22:11.058 --> 00:22:11.891
Well that's it?

540
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:12.724
We're in.

541
00:22:12.724 --> 00:22:13.724
We're in. Oh God.

542
00:22:13.724 --> 00:22:17.245
The reason this is cool is that
you can see it for yourself.

543
00:22:17.245 --> 00:22:21.356
Head on over to you. your ass got served.

544
00:22:21.356 --> 00:22:23.970
and you will be viewing a
webpage that is literally

545
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.035
being served up from
inside of our participant.

546
00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:30.583
Be part of history. It's
being made right now.

547
00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:33.037
and it's disturbing to say the least.

548
00:22:35.473 --> 00:22:37.948
Kevin and
Olivia jumping into the pie.

549
00:22:37.948 --> 00:22:40.137
I think that's probably
one of the seminal moments.

550
00:22:40.137 --> 00:22:41.654
The world
has been waiting for a

551
00:22:41.654 --> 00:22:44.466
half-Chinese. half-American
girl. from the Midwest.

552
00:22:44.466 --> 00:22:49.046
diving into a giant chocolate
film cre-. filled cream pie.

553
00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:50.797
My friends. this is America at its finest.

554
00:22:50.797 --> 00:22:51.755
Drink it up.

555
00:22:51.755 --> 00:22:53.163
And
they made this giant pie.

556
00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:55.118
I guess it was a world record
and they were trying for that.

557
00:22:55.118 --> 00:22:57.521
We had bought
out every can of pudding

558
00:22:57.521 --> 00:23:01.122
in the LA area. and it
was just this huge project

559
00:23:01.122 --> 00:23:01.955
in the studio.

560
00:23:01.955 --> 00:23:02.913
Three. two. one!

561
00:23:02.913 --> 00:23:03.833
Jump Olivia!

562
00:23:08.496 --> 00:23:10.697
When Olivia
first jumped in the pie.

563
00:23:10.697 --> 00:23:12.671
they had a little pad at the bottom.

564
00:23:12.671 --> 00:23:13.800
so she didn't hurt herself.

565
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.301
but she missed the pad.
or jumped past the pad.

566
00:23:16.301 --> 00:23:19.015
and her knees hit the concrete floor.

567
00:23:19.015 --> 00:23:21.073
She was just doubled over in pain.

568
00:23:22.806 --> 00:23:26.851
Luckily she
hid it. but it was pretty hurt.

569
00:23:28.976 --> 00:23:31.588
Unbeknownst
to me. Kevin decided.

570
00:23:31.588 --> 00:23:34.632
so that she wouldn't
feel super uncomfortable.

571
00:23:34.632 --> 00:23:37.402
we had a French made costume
underneath his tuxedo.

572
00:23:37.402 --> 00:23:38.626
and he jumped in.

573
00:23:41.631 --> 00:23:43.837
He kind of
went in more diving style.

574
00:23:43.837 --> 00:23:47.116
He. he landed more on. on his butt.

575
00:23:47.116 --> 00:23:48.893
This is what
America can accomplish. Huh?

576
00:23:48.893 --> 00:23:50.572
I still can't hear outta my right ear.

577
00:23:50.572 --> 00:23:51.405
What? What happened?

578
00:23:51.405 --> 00:23:53.318
There's pudding in it.

579
00:23:53.318 --> 00:23:54.701
Should I blow it to the other side?

580
00:23:54.701 --> 00:23:55.534
Yes. clear out.

581
00:23:56.367 --> 00:23:57.200
Oh. oh. oh!

582
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.143
Apparently the
pudding got into everything.

583
00:23:59.143 --> 00:24:00.954
and so they had to get
everything cleaned out.

584
00:24:00.954 --> 00:24:03.410
and then it took two
days with a septic truck

585
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.483
to actually empty that whole thing out.

586
00:24:05.483 --> 00:24:06.564
I thought
your knee popped out.

587
00:24:06.564 --> 00:24:07.681
I thought we were going
the ambulance again.

588
00:24:07.681 --> 00:24:09.516
Even Andy was like. "I could
hear that. That was bad".

589
00:24:09.516 --> 00:24:11.654
By then.
the studio stunk really bad

590
00:24:11.654 --> 00:24:14.131
because all this pudding. It
had just gone horribly wrong.

591
00:24:14.131 --> 00:24:16.220
Well thanks
Internet for making this a.

592
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.237
this a possibility. You
know. I don't know if I'd say

593
00:24:18.237 --> 00:24:20.551
it was a dream of mine.
but it was someone's dream.

594
00:24:20.551 --> 00:24:22.269
and look what happened. huh?

595
00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:23.730
These were the kinds of things

596
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.258
that just happened on a regular basis.

597
00:24:26.258 --> 00:24:29.580
We would read through these
skits. and they were super funny

598
00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.279
and we would carry them out live on TV.

599
00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:33.488
And then. one of these two
would just do something

600
00:24:33.488 --> 00:24:36.865
that would bring an extra
panache to whatever it was

601
00:24:36.865 --> 00:24:37.698
we were doing.

602
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.662
♪ Attack of the Show. Attack. ♪

603
00:24:45.662 --> 00:24:47.720
National Major League
Gaming championships.

604
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.542
Then it turns out McHammer
isn't dead. or so he says. And-

605
00:24:52.542 --> 00:24:54.201
Kevin picked up on it right away

606
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:55.311
and Olivia was like. what?

607
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:57.539
Hey McHammer don't hurt him.

608
00:24:57.539 --> 00:24:58.372
Did I say something wrong?

609
00:24:58.372 --> 00:25:00.271
Yeah. No. no. I mean. no. you're fine.

610
00:25:00.271 --> 00:25:01.393
Jeff Bridges kicks it-

611
00:25:01.393 --> 00:25:02.837
He finally pointed it out to her.

612
00:25:02.837 --> 00:25:03.670
Was is McHammer?

613
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:04.907
It's MC Hammer!

614
00:25:05.865 --> 00:25:06.730
It's her reaction to it.

615
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.643
and the embarrassment of
it. Boy is it spectacular.

616
00:25:08.643 --> 00:25:09.543
Is that Ronald McDonald

617
00:25:09.543 --> 00:25:11.363
with parachute pants from the eighties?

618
00:25:11.363 --> 00:25:13.391
And then the
forums would just light up.

619
00:25:13.391 --> 00:25:15.703
and then become something
bigger than it is.

620
00:25:15.703 --> 00:25:17.244
Thanks McHammer!

621
00:25:18.077 --> 00:25:19.876
Someone had the idea
to do the "McHammer" thing

622
00:25:19.876 --> 00:25:22.521
and hire Kel to play McHammer.

623
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:24.824
It's McHammer Time. McHammer.

624
00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:26.095
Too legit.

625
00:25:26.095 --> 00:25:27.646
too legit to quit baby!

626
00:25:27.646 --> 00:25:28.479
Yeah!

627
00:25:28.479 --> 00:25:29.312
See?

628
00:25:29.312 --> 00:25:30.758
We have to get
him into studio sometime.

629
00:25:30.758 --> 00:25:31.749
We need to. so we can

630
00:25:31.749 --> 00:25:32.582
teach you how to dance.

631
00:25:32.582 --> 00:25:34.739
Oh no. you don't
have to wait for McHammer.

632
00:25:34.739 --> 00:25:35.947
McHammer's here!

633
00:25:42.773 --> 00:25:45.201
My. my. my. my name's McHammer.

634
00:25:45.201 --> 00:25:47.630
Oh my. I like shakes and fries.

635
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.463
Don't you.

636
00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:51.491
wanna eat my double McNugget.
baby move your feet.

637
00:25:51.491 --> 00:25:52.324
Oh!

638
00:25:52.324 --> 00:25:53.963
And that just all spawned from a.

639
00:25:53.963 --> 00:25:55.752
a live natural moment.

640
00:25:55.752 --> 00:25:58.193
That's part of the.
the magic of that show.

641
00:25:58.193 --> 00:25:59.700
Quite thrust-y.

642
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.450
He's breaking in down like a Big Mac

643
00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:05.153
for the camera ladies and gentlemen.

644
00:26:06.891 --> 00:26:08.593
One week.
I told executive producer

645
00:26:08.593 --> 00:26:11.428
Gavin Purcell that I
couldn't do "DVDuesday".

646
00:26:11.428 --> 00:26:14.081
I had to go to Comic-Con
and Gavin asked me.

647
00:26:14.081 --> 00:26:18.268
"Comic-Con. what's that? A
convention for comedians?"

648
00:26:18.268 --> 00:26:20.580
And I said. no. it's San Diego Comic-Con

649
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.568
is the biggest pop culture
convention in the world.

650
00:26:23.568 --> 00:26:25.290
So that week right after DVDuesday.

651
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:28.741
I jumped in my car and drove to San Diego.

652
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:32.406
Hey man. I gotta pee.

653
00:26:32.406 --> 00:26:33.553
Well you should have thought about that

654
00:26:33.553 --> 00:26:35.550
before we left Chris.

655
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.711
Listen. we're halfway to Comic-Con.

656
00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:37.920
Just hold it. You can
pee when we get there.

657
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.893
You'll be fine. Everybody's fine.

658
00:26:39.893 --> 00:26:41.845
Avengers assemble bitch. yeah!

659
00:26:41.845 --> 00:26:43.671
What does that. what
does does that mean?

660
00:26:43.671 --> 00:26:44.785
Avengers assemble.

661
00:26:44.785 --> 00:26:46.208
All right. I don't
know what that means and.

662
00:26:46.208 --> 00:26:47.041
Avengers assemble.

663
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:47.971
Yeah. that's. that's great.

664
00:26:47.971 --> 00:26:48.985
You don't need to raise this roof up.

665
00:26:48.985 --> 00:26:51.008
I know. but I'm like hulking
out. It's our nerd cry.

666
00:26:51.008 --> 00:26:52.310
But
don't Hulk out in the car.

667
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.143
Just don't hit the roof.

668
00:26:53.143 --> 00:26:54.101
Okay.

669
00:26:54.101 --> 00:26:55.067
Don't test me!

670
00:26:55.067 --> 00:26:56.467
All right. all right.

671
00:26:56.467 --> 00:26:58.077
Hey Blair. you think I
can read one of your comics?

672
00:26:58.077 --> 00:26:59.814
You have like 20 boxes back here.

673
00:26:59.814 --> 00:27:02.115
Actually those are my
"Film Threat" magazines.

674
00:27:02.115 --> 00:27:04.102
Then. where the are my comics?

675
00:27:04.102 --> 00:27:05.728
Don't worry. I put 'em on the roof.

676
00:27:05.728 --> 00:27:06.561
What?

677
00:27:06.561 --> 00:27:07.644
No. Blair? No. No.

678
00:27:08.477 --> 00:27:10.064
In the car. in the car. You're fine.

679
00:27:10.064 --> 00:27:11.215
My comics!

680
00:27:11.215 --> 00:27:12.764
Your comics
are fine. Everybody's fine.

681
00:27:13.925 --> 00:27:15.600
Anybody want
to hear some humorous.

682
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.865
country rock twang?

683
00:27:16.865 --> 00:27:19.179
No. No. Zach. no.

684
00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:22.354
Zach! There will be no
humorous. country rock twang

685
00:27:22.354 --> 00:27:24.129
while I'm driving. Zach. thank you though.

686
00:27:24.129 --> 00:27:25.752
You know what? Don't
test me on this.

687
00:27:25.752 --> 00:27:27.582
Go Host arena. Okay. pal?

Excuse me sir.

Do you have any Grey Poupon?

Any who. I'm just gonna.

rape Steve Trevor. probably in that order.

693
00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:40.803
So.

694
00:27:41.916 --> 00:27:43.681
just see you "dork-o"s later.

695
00:27:47.258 --> 00:27:50.482
Uh. hey guys. I don't
have to pee anymore.

696
00:27:52.408 --> 00:27:53.570
Dude. Gore!

697
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:54.892
Are you kidding me?

698
00:27:54.892 --> 00:27:57.842
Obviously you don't
have to anymore either.

699
00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:58.940
Avengers assemble. bitch.

700
00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.403
Don't

701
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.373
E3 and Comic-Con
to me were. you know.

702
00:28:07.373 --> 00:28:09.040
the linchpins to G4.

703
00:28:10.788 --> 00:28:13.488
Nobody was really that
familiar with Comic-Con

704
00:28:13.488 --> 00:28:15.236
back in those days.

705
00:28:15.236 --> 00:28:17.824
but when we actually made
it to our first Comic-Con

706
00:28:17.824 --> 00:28:21.763
in San Diego. that was. that
was a pretty amazing time.

707
00:28:21.763 --> 00:28:26.277
And I really feel those are
the shows that cemented G4

708
00:28:26.277 --> 00:28:28.944
as a up and coming cool channel.

709
00:28:30.025 --> 00:28:34.162
We're about to enter every
comic book geeks fantasy

710
00:28:34.162 --> 00:28:35.313
right now.

711
00:28:36.749 --> 00:28:38.363
This is Comic-Con!

712
00:28:40.748 --> 00:28:43.470
They had never
allowed a television network

713
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.209
to put a stage in and broadcast
an entire television show

714
00:28:47.209 --> 00:28:49.387
live from inside the convention.

715
00:28:49.387 --> 00:28:51.447
And I convinced them to let us do it.

716
00:28:51.447 --> 00:28:53.398
And they didn't realize the flood gates

717
00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:54.661
that they were opening.

718
00:28:54.661 --> 00:28:58.046
No other TV show
has ever broadcasted live

719
00:28:58.046 --> 00:29:00.072
from this monster event.

720
00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:03.005
So be prepared to witness
history in the making.

721
00:29:03.005 --> 00:29:04.030
Guinness is here.

722
00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.863
Guinness is here.

723
00:29:04.863 --> 00:29:05.696
They are watching.

724
00:29:05.696 --> 00:29:07.955
They put us right
inside the main entrance

725
00:29:07.955 --> 00:29:11.803
on a stage that was only
one foot off the floor.

726
00:29:11.803 --> 00:29:16.680
Thousands of fans refused to
move. blocking the entrance.

727
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.105
because they wanted to watch
"Attack of the Show" live.

728
00:29:20.105 --> 00:29:24.141
It was so successful that
the next year they allowed us

729
00:29:24.141 --> 00:29:27.615
to build a two-story
stage so that our hosts

730
00:29:27.615 --> 00:29:30.561
could actually be above Comic-Con.

731
00:29:30.561 --> 00:29:33.655
and we still clogged up all the aisles.

732
00:29:33.655 --> 00:29:35.441
Yes. You look great. you look great.

733
00:29:35.441 --> 00:29:36.568
I'm. I'm glad you decided to join me.

734
00:29:36.568 --> 00:29:38.161
What do you mean join you? What do you?

735
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:39.629
You're supposed to dress up with me.

736
00:29:39.629 --> 00:29:41.223
Can you tell who I am? Hmm.

737
00:29:41.223 --> 00:29:42.289
No.

738
00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:43.122
Green Lantern. What?

739
00:29:43.122 --> 00:29:44.205
There's my ring.

740
00:29:44.205 --> 00:29:45.038
Done.

741
00:29:45.038 --> 00:29:45.871
What?

742
00:29:45.871 --> 00:29:46.704
Green Lantern! Yeah.

743
00:29:47.537 --> 00:29:48.942
No. no. no. no.

744
00:29:48.942 --> 00:29:51.507
The challenges at those spaces

745
00:29:51.507 --> 00:29:54.732
were size limitations. number one.

746
00:29:54.732 --> 00:29:56.620
They work really hard.

747
00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.832
work really hard.

748
00:29:57.832 --> 00:29:59.642
The sheer amount of crowd.

749
00:29:59.642 --> 00:30:02.492
and it wasn't even as crowded
back then. as it is now.

750
00:30:02.492 --> 00:30:03.590
Like.
I'd see the pictures

751
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.768
from the guys who went
and it was. it was insane.

752
00:30:05.768 --> 00:30:09.093
Like you. you couldn't go on
your lunch break more than

753
00:30:09.093 --> 00:30:11.705
to the bathroom. because it
was such an insane asylum.

754
00:30:13.517 --> 00:30:15.817
So it was hard
to get over to the stage.

755
00:30:15.817 --> 00:30:16.650
get prepped.

756
00:30:20.393 --> 00:30:22.053
You're
working in the trailers.

757
00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:23.341
then you gotta come out
to the production trucks.

758
00:30:23.341 --> 00:30:24.796
I could've gave you a chair.

759
00:30:24.796 --> 00:30:25.629
Then you gotta run

760
00:30:25.629 --> 00:30:27.743
all the way to the stage
within five minutes.

761
00:30:27.743 --> 00:30:30.315
because your next segment's coming up.

762
00:30:30.315 --> 00:30:31.829
Day one was insane. man.

763
00:30:31.829 --> 00:30:33.952
Genji] Doing those shows
helped both Comic-Con.

764
00:30:33.952 --> 00:30:36.752
and G4 get to bigger heights.

765
00:30:36.752 --> 00:30:39.490
Ten years. twelve years
later. it's just massive.

766
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.690
And I think those shows
had a lot to do with it.

767
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.202
and it's exposing it to. you know.

768
00:30:44.202 --> 00:30:47.815
an audience that maybe wasn't quite sure.

769
00:30:47.815 --> 00:30:49.927
Maybe they just didn't
know a whole lot about

770
00:30:49.927 --> 00:30:51.130
what was going on out there.

771
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.505
They were. those were
some of the best times.

772
00:30:53.505 --> 00:30:55.542
Before
then. Comic-Con was probably

773
00:30:55.542 --> 00:30:58.363
only covered by a San
Diego local news person

774
00:30:58.363 --> 00:31:00.078
standing outside the
convention center saying.

775
00:31:00.078 --> 00:31:02.015
"Oh. this is crazy. There's
a lot of people here."

776
00:31:02.015 --> 00:31:03.728
Versus actually doing coverage.

777
00:31:04.561 --> 00:31:06.132
which I think also kind of coincided with

778
00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:08.859
television networks and.
and. and movie studios

779
00:31:08.859 --> 00:31:11.822
realizing. hey. if there are people here.

780
00:31:11.822 --> 00:31:14.757
we should have a presence
here to help build our movie.

781
00:31:17.159 --> 00:31:19.945
Now when
they hold that convention.

782
00:31:19.945 --> 00:31:24.498
so many of the people who attend
are people from Hollywood.

783
00:31:24.498 --> 00:31:27.360
from the movies. from television.

784
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.624
from all forms of the media.

785
00:31:29.624 --> 00:31:32.185
They're looking for the next great idea.

786
00:31:32.185 --> 00:31:33.569
that might be in comic books.

787
00:31:34.672 --> 00:31:35.755
Huh?

788
00:31:35.755 --> 00:31:36.659
You're at Comic-Con?

789
00:31:36.659 --> 00:31:37.492
Yes. I am.

790
00:31:37.492 --> 00:31:39.743
You wanna say that loud with excitement?

791
00:31:39.743 --> 00:31:41.326
I'm at Comic-Con!

792
00:31:43.596 --> 00:31:44.429
Behold.

793
00:31:45.962 --> 00:31:49.312
Today. the
console war reaches new heights

794
00:31:49.312 --> 00:31:52.027
and only one network
brings it to you live.

795
00:31:53.356 --> 00:31:54.816
When I arrived at G4.

796
00:31:54.816 --> 00:31:58.566
they had only aired the
press events from E3.

797
00:31:59.566 --> 00:32:03.004
So I said. let's take these press events.

798
00:32:03.004 --> 00:32:05.403
and put our hosts in front of them.

799
00:32:05.403 --> 00:32:09.126
Geez. Hey everybody
welcome to E3 '06 Live.

800
00:32:09.126 --> 00:32:11.386
Let's do post
shows where we talk to people

801
00:32:11.386 --> 00:32:14.659
about what they just saw.
Let's take what is coverage.

802
00:32:14.659 --> 00:32:17.046
and make it content. And within two years.

803
00:32:17.046 --> 00:32:21.863
we've turned it into 25
hours of live television.

804
00:32:21.863 --> 00:32:23.054
Microsoft knows the console

805
00:32:23.054 --> 00:32:24.197
is up against some stiff competition

806
00:32:24.197 --> 00:32:26.397
in the form of the PlayStation
3. but they're counting

807
00:32:26.397 --> 00:32:29.522
on the success of Xbox Live
and a few key exclusives

808
00:32:29.522 --> 00:32:30.780
to really save the day.

809
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.913
We'd go down there.

810
00:32:31.913 --> 00:32:34.410
and shoot this mega. mega content.

811
00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.022
is in the house!

812
00:32:38.385 --> 00:32:40.983
We would capture
it for three. four days.

813
00:32:40.983 --> 00:32:43.859
and a stream of live
packages right into. uh.

814
00:32:43.859 --> 00:32:45.975
the live show and the countdown ticker

815
00:32:45.975 --> 00:32:47.800
for when we'd be dropping information.

816
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.823
We're gonna break news here.

817
00:32:48.823 --> 00:32:51.551
Sessler. and Morgan. They were.

818
00:32:51.551 --> 00:32:53.476
they were so into the games.

819
00:32:53.476 --> 00:32:55.138
I'm so excited!

820
00:32:55.138 --> 00:32:56.465
They would
always ask great questions.

821
00:32:56.465 --> 00:32:58.864
that would lead to a little
nugget of information

822
00:32:58.864 --> 00:33:01.500
about the game that they would
possibly try to leak to us

823
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.088
before anybody else. And that
was like their specialty.

824
00:33:04.088 --> 00:33:05.950
What's inside it? We didn't hear much

825
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:08.023
in the way of the specs. I
think. I think. Bill Gates

826
00:33:08.023 --> 00:33:09.384
actually kind of rattled
'em off very quickly

827
00:33:09.384 --> 00:33:12.184
We've got secrets. you'll
see some stuff at retail.

828
00:33:12.184 --> 00:33:13.973
It's a monster inside. man.

829
00:33:13.973 --> 00:33:15.017
There's a monster inside. I mean.

830
00:33:15.017 --> 00:33:16.227
are there. are there any numbers?

831
00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:18.278
ATI is doing
this really. really great

832
00:33:18.278 --> 00:33:20.186
custom graphics card for
us. with 10 megabytes

833
00:33:20.186 --> 00:33:22.455
of embedded DRAM. that's
gonna let programmers

834
00:33:22.455 --> 00:33:24.756
just do amazing things with graphics.

835
00:33:24.756 --> 00:33:26.827
All right. It's an exciting
and a stressful time.

836
00:33:26.827 --> 00:33:28.179
There's no question. if
anyone could handle it.

837
00:33:28.179 --> 00:33:29.524
It is J. Allard.

838
00:33:31.023 --> 00:33:33.695
It was a
surreal broadcasting space

839
00:33:33.695 --> 00:33:35.773
where it came together and we
were making this television

840
00:33:35.773 --> 00:33:39.372
where kids were tapped into this event.

841
00:33:39.372 --> 00:33:40.745
And it's something that I've grown up with

842
00:33:40.745 --> 00:33:43.320
my entire video game life.

843
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.551
And so it was really cool to watch.

844
00:33:44.551 --> 00:33:46.133
and be a part of to make that.

845
00:33:46.133 --> 00:33:47.599
And it's one of the most

846
00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:50.220
satisfying things we did at G4

847
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.231
is we became the home for E3.

848
00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:55.922
No one covered that
convention the way we did.

849
00:33:55.922 --> 00:33:58.599
and it was a communal experience.

850
00:33:58.599 --> 00:34:03.016
and we owned that convention.
I'm very proud of that.

851
00:34:08.107 --> 00:34:10.347
Technology.
the fastest moving force

852
00:34:10.347 --> 00:34:13.375
in the galaxy. engineered
by the smartest minds

853
00:34:13.375 --> 00:34:14.509
on the planet.

854
00:34:14.509 --> 00:34:16.288
The CES stuff in Vegas.

855
00:34:16.288 --> 00:34:18.535
I remember going out. doing karaoke.

856
00:34:18.535 --> 00:34:21.634
having beers with everybody.
and then hoping everybody

857
00:34:21.634 --> 00:34:24.690
made it to the set at
7:00 AM for the call time.

858
00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:25.756
It was always an adventure.

859
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:29.514
♪ I'm up my gear and I'm
heading to the desert. ♪

860
00:34:29.514 --> 00:34:30.850

865
00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:41.542
We would go to GDC.

866
00:34:41.542 --> 00:34:42.663
the Game Developer's Conference.

867
00:34:42.663 --> 00:34:46.931
where we would go to San
Francisco. and we would watch devs

868
00:34:46.931 --> 00:34:50.477
make a video game in 24
hours. and then also check out

869
00:34:50.477 --> 00:34:53.480
what other video game
developers were putting out

870
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.918
at the time. And it was
really exciting to be

871
00:34:54.918 --> 00:34:57.789
in the space to see which
game's coming out next.

872
00:34:57.789 --> 00:35:00.205
If you're a gamer. that kind
of thing is very special

873
00:35:00.205 --> 00:35:02.805
to be involved with. to be able
to see that thing firsthand.

874
00:35:02.805 --> 00:35:05.467
The Tokyo
Game Show is finally here. folks

875
00:35:05.467 --> 00:35:09.265
and what a show it is. Over
600 titles out on that floor.

876
00:35:09.265 --> 00:35:12.281
Three next generation
consoles. all battling it out.

877
00:35:12.281 --> 00:35:14.139
Jockeying for the number one position.

878
00:35:14.139 --> 00:35:17.537
We started going to
Tokyo for Tokyo Game Show.

879
00:35:17.537 --> 00:35:21.307
And we were there for 17
days and it was absolutely

880
00:35:21.307 --> 00:35:22.424
fucking nuts.

881
00:35:30.176 --> 00:35:31.497
Welcome to Tokyo.

882
00:35:31.497 --> 00:35:33.546
the coolest city on the planet.

883
00:35:33.546 --> 00:35:36.572
6.000 miles away. and two steps ahead.

884
00:35:39.991 --> 00:35:41.834
All the stuff
that we filmed in Tokyo.

885
00:35:41.834 --> 00:35:45.593
we would stay in Shinjuku. And
me. and Kevin. and Sessler.

886
00:35:45.593 --> 00:35:48.917
a bunch of the producers.
were told very. very strictly.

887
00:35:48.917 --> 00:35:52.638
Do not go to sleep when
you get to the hotel.

888
00:35:52.638 --> 00:35:54.907
Oh. hope that is.

889
00:35:54.907 --> 00:35:56.908
So all of us go out to karaoke

890
00:35:56.908 --> 00:35:59.959
until four or five o'clock in
the morning and then pass out.

891
00:36:04.931 --> 00:36:06.014
Kevin.

892
00:36:06.014 --> 00:36:07.374
We would do stuff like that.

893
00:36:07.374 --> 00:36:08.557
Everybody was fearless.

894
00:36:08.557 --> 00:36:11.313
I mean we would go out.
and we would eat anything.

895
00:36:11.313 --> 00:36:15.456
We would go anywhere.
and like it was so fun.

896
00:36:15.456 --> 00:36:17.706
Oh my god. It's all bone.

897
00:36:18.544 --> 00:36:21.374
The delicate taste is
very pleasing to my palate.

898
00:36:21.374 --> 00:36:24.388
And then we had
fourteen to sixteen hour days.

899
00:36:24.388 --> 00:36:27.768
We had a lot to cover.
We had to do live hits.

900
00:36:27.768 --> 00:36:29.148
We were doing packages.

901
00:36:29.148 --> 00:36:32.051
One of my favorite packages
that we ever did that I still.

902
00:36:32.051 --> 00:36:34.703
it was one of my favorite
memories of just being on a shoot.

903
00:36:34.703 --> 00:36:36.679
How
long have I been awake?

904
00:36:36.679 --> 00:36:37.794
So many questions.

905
00:36:37.794 --> 00:36:41.172
No wonder I can't sleep. and
I can't shake the feeling.

906
00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:43.635
that I'm being followed.

907
00:36:43.635 --> 00:36:45.791
Brian Keller
came up with this gag.

908
00:36:45.791 --> 00:36:47.736
that was supposed to look like a kaiju

909
00:36:47.736 --> 00:36:49.414
from a Godzilla movie.

910
00:36:49.414 --> 00:36:52.885
We had him built
by a costume designer in LA.

911
00:36:52.885 --> 00:36:56.975
and it's this gigantic
purple googly eye squid.

912
00:36:56.975 --> 00:37:01.558
And we brought him to Japan.
in a big refrigerator box.

913
00:37:08.853 --> 00:37:10.413
Hey. you're awake.

914
00:37:10.413 --> 00:37:13.704
Oh my God. No. no.
don't eat me. don't eat me

915
00:37:13.704 --> 00:37:14.537
No. no.

916
00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.837
Mr. Kevin Pereira. I'm your friend.

917
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.163
Please calm down. You passed out.

918
00:37:19.163 --> 00:37:21.155
So one morning the producer was

919
00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:25.337
in this squid costume. and
it was like five o'clock

920
00:37:25.337 --> 00:37:28.052
in the morning. these
dumb-ass fucking Americans.

921
00:37:28.052 --> 00:37:31.290
are running around this huge fish market

922
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.370
that is just packed with people.

923
00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.526
And Kevin is narrating it the whole time.

924
00:37:35.526 --> 00:37:37.863
But it was like
the Kevin and Squid show.

925
00:37:37.863 --> 00:37:40.080
and they're like doing
this bromance all over

926
00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:40.913
the streets of Tokyo.

927
00:37:40.913 --> 00:37:41.958
Let's get some food. Yeah.

928
00:37:42.791 --> 00:37:43.624
Oh!

929
00:37:43.624 --> 00:37:44.457
It was fantastic.

930
00:37:44.457 --> 00:37:46.002
There were people who had knives.

931
00:37:46.002 --> 00:37:47.721
that were coming up against us. like.

932
00:37:47.721 --> 00:37:50.581
while we were running
through. It was crazy.

933
00:37:50.581 --> 00:37:53.020
You never knew what you
were gonna get next.

934
00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.020
You're a funny squid.

935
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.512
No man. you. you're the man dude. you.

936
00:37:56.512 --> 00:37:57.345
No. you.

937
00:37:57.345 --> 00:37:58.178
You.

938
00:37:58.178 --> 00:37:59.258
You. you're the man.

939
00:38:04.055 --> 00:38:06.887
The stage
that I'm on right now.

940
00:38:06.887 --> 00:38:07.720
you'll notice it's pushed forward.

941
00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.895
This is like sort of an interview spot.

942
00:38:08.895 --> 00:38:11.782
but we can actually scoot it
back right beneath this plasma.

943
00:38:11.782 --> 00:38:14.572
And then normally this is the
home base area for the show.

944
00:38:14.572 --> 00:38:16.230
So our sets really modular.

945
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:19.905
Um. we. It happens to be the
size of a Payless shoebox.

946
00:38:19.905 --> 00:38:21.038
It's a very. very small studio.

947
00:38:21.038 --> 00:38:23.180
But. through positioning of monitors.

948
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.908
and using wide angle lenses.
we really make it look like

949
00:38:24.908 --> 00:38:28.291
it's a "Seacrestian" sized dressing room.

950
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:30.278
here on the old set. And
then again over here.

951
00:38:30.278 --> 00:38:34.151
more crazy plasmas. There's.
uh. me and Candace down there

952
00:38:34.151 --> 00:38:37.069
and we can can pipe
individual images to this.

953
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:39.358
B-roll clips from a movie.
or from a video game.

954
00:38:39.358 --> 00:38:41.574
or from whatever if a guest
is coming on to talk about it.

955
00:38:41.574 --> 00:38:43.574
And. uh. that's a light.

956
00:38:44.574 --> 00:38:49.037
And these are cameras. these
are what steal our soul.

957
00:38:49.037 --> 00:38:51.412
In like 2004.

958
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:56.061
2005 maybe. all of a sudden.
we were all getting recognized.

959
00:38:56.061 --> 00:38:59.065
All of a sudden. people were
asking take for our pictures.

960
00:38:59.065 --> 00:39:01.417
All of a sudden. we
needed a security guard

961
00:39:01.417 --> 00:39:03.920
to follow us around.
Because when one person asks

962
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.850
for your picture. then everyone
around thinks it's okay.

963
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:08.597
and next thing you know
you got 50 people asking

964
00:39:08.597 --> 00:39:13.103
for your picture. Those were
some pretty milestone moments.

965
00:39:13.103 --> 00:39:15.898
Look at how far we've come.
and at the time. you know.

966
00:39:15.898 --> 00:39:20.148
we were the only ones who
knew what that felt like.

967
00:39:21.639 --> 00:39:24.950
This is the AOTS panel.
and it's very crowded.

968
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:25.783
I. I don't

969
00:39:25.783 --> 00:39:26.660
Are we going in soon?

970
00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:27.493
Extremely crowded.

971
00:39:27.493 --> 00:39:28.700
Somebody
threw panties at Kevin.

972
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.561
Yeah.
That was your wife.

973
00:39:32.561 --> 00:39:33.394
I love my wife.

974
00:39:33.394 --> 00:39:34.894
I love her too.

975
00:39:36.521 --> 00:39:40.013
Not in that way. It's purely physical.

976
00:39:40.013 --> 00:39:42.640
And so here we were
in this crazy weird position

977
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.248
where we were being hounded
for pictures and autographs.

978
00:39:46.248 --> 00:39:49.634
and so I think that
bonded us all. because it.

979
00:39:49.634 --> 00:39:53.285
it would be hard for anyone
not in that position to relate

980
00:39:53.285 --> 00:39:54.943
to what that feels like.

981
00:39:56.263 --> 00:39:57.636
We'd be on the show floor.

982
00:39:57.636 --> 00:40:01.332
and I'd be walked along with
either Kevin. or Olivia.

983
00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:03.945
We didn't have a lot of
security for them because

984
00:40:03.945 --> 00:40:07.638
it was still sort of a growing
thing and we'd get stopped.

985
00:40:07.638 --> 00:40:09.620
We couldn't go five feet
without people wanting

986
00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:12.332
to take pictures and eventually
it would get so tight.

987
00:40:12.332 --> 00:40:14.402
You would just have to
push through people.

988
00:40:14.402 --> 00:40:17.196
and ignore people and try
not to be jerks about it.

989
00:40:17.196 --> 00:40:18.728
Olivia. you're awesome.

990
00:40:18.728 --> 00:40:19.602
Thank you.

991
00:40:19.602 --> 00:40:23.096
Kev. You're cool too. as well.

992
00:40:23.096 --> 00:40:24.328
You're cool too. What a compliment!

993
00:40:24.328 --> 00:40:25.594
You hear that? That's a compliment.

994
00:40:25.594 --> 00:40:27.379
Hey.
you're alright as well.

995
00:40:27.379 --> 00:40:29.269
Hey. sometimes I like watching you.

996
00:40:29.269 --> 00:40:32.638
I. I think one time
was Olivia wearing slave Leia

997
00:40:32.638 --> 00:40:36.102
at one of the Comic-Cons.
Fans were losing their minds

998
00:40:36.102 --> 00:40:36.935
trying to get pictures with her.

999
00:40:36.935 --> 00:40:38.302
and we would just have
to like cover her up.

1000
00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:39.859
and get her out of the venue.

1001
00:40:42.648 --> 00:40:43.981
I am the Leia.

1002
00:40:45.481 --> 00:40:48.483
In the end. There can be only one.

1003
00:40:54.137 --> 00:40:55.307
I am the last!

1004
00:40:57.404 --> 00:40:59.245
You even killed the younglings.

1005
00:40:59.245 --> 00:41:00.801
Yeah. well they should have ducked.

1006
00:41:02.091 --> 00:41:03.049
Olivia!

1007
00:41:03.049 --> 00:41:04.662
They need you back on set.

1008
00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:06.373
What?

1009
00:41:06.373 --> 00:41:08.891
And they need you in regular clothes.

1010
00:41:08.891 --> 00:41:10.475
Oh. huh.

1011
00:41:10.475 --> 00:41:12.546
And I think the police
are looking for you.

1012
00:41:12.546 --> 00:41:13.866
Oh. haha.

1013
00:41:13.866 --> 00:41:14.699
Sorry.

1014
00:41:14.699 --> 00:41:15.532
Okay.

1015
00:41:15.532 --> 00:41:16.714
At one point. "Attack
of the Show" was mentioned

1016
00:41:16.714 --> 00:41:18.611
in Rolling Stone. It was
mainly this. it was like.

1017
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:20.715
"Attack of the Show"
is the fun. cool. hip.

1018
00:41:20.715 --> 00:41:22.824
technology gaming show on G4 network.

1019
00:41:22.824 --> 00:41:25.365
We know we've never heard of
it either. in parenthesis.

1020
00:41:25.365 --> 00:41:27.446
and it says. it's worth it. to watch

1021
00:41:27.446 --> 00:41:30.756
the stunning Olivia Munn lead
you through your daily grind

1022
00:41:30.756 --> 00:41:35.118
of video games. tech movies.
and celebrity interviews.

1023
00:41:35.118 --> 00:41:37.427
The dudes on the show
are mostly forgettable.

1024
00:41:37.427 --> 00:41:38.260
Then I was like fuck you!

1025
00:41:39.201 --> 00:41:40.823
You know?

1026
00:41:40.823 --> 00:41:43.527
We knew that
"Attack of the Show" had become

1027
00:41:43.527 --> 00:41:47.318
a pop culture hit when "Big Bang Theory"

1028
00:41:47.318 --> 00:41:50.428
put "Attack of the Show" and G4 Magnets.

1029
00:41:50.428 --> 00:41:52.089
on their refrigerator.

1030
00:41:52.922 --> 00:41:54.449
John Favreau everybody!

1031
00:41:55.282 --> 00:41:56.845
Yeah. when you got here.
I had to parade you around

1032
00:41:56.845 --> 00:41:57.678
to the different sections.

1033
00:41:57.678 --> 00:42:00.071
I know. It's. I got.
it's just grown so much

1034
00:42:00.071 --> 00:42:01.238
since last time we did this.

1035
00:42:01.238 --> 00:42:02.457
Yeah. It's unbelievable. You-

1036
00:42:02.457 --> 00:42:04.005
This all really started here. for us.

1037
00:42:04.005 --> 00:42:04.838
It did.

1038
00:42:04.838 --> 00:42:07.165
We came off the panel. and
you were the one who said.

1039
00:42:07.165 --> 00:42:09.114
"Hey. it went over like gang busters".

1040
00:42:09.114 --> 00:42:09.947
I didn't know.

1041
00:42:09.947 --> 00:42:10.780
Yeah.

1042
00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.730
You know how. how much
the word had spread.

1043
00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.722
and now here we are two years
later with "Iron Man 2".

1044
00:42:14.722 --> 00:42:16.716
And thanks to you and thanks
to "Attack of the Show"

1045
00:42:16.716 --> 00:42:18.451
for being there for us and covering it

1046
00:42:18.451 --> 00:42:21.313
for the last few years and
really starting the grassroots

1047
00:42:21.313 --> 00:42:23.824
support for it that brought us mainstream

1048
00:42:23.824 --> 00:42:24.991
into all the success we had.

1049
00:42:24.991 --> 00:42:26.295
Well thank.
thank you so much John.

1050
00:42:26.295 --> 00:42:28.573
We love you. We love Iron Man.

1051
00:42:28.573 --> 00:42:29.938
That's
what I think G4 did best

1052
00:42:29.938 --> 00:42:32.797
about these events that mainstream media

1053
00:42:32.797 --> 00:42:34.772
didn't really realize.

1054
00:42:34.772 --> 00:42:37.803
Just seeing other celebrities
walking by and realizing.

1055
00:42:37.803 --> 00:42:40.705
hey. it's G4. Hey. it's
a "Attack of the Show"!

1056
00:42:40.705 --> 00:42:43.339
In our world. in this. in
this world of pop culture.

1057
00:42:43.339 --> 00:42:45.015
we had placed our mark as like.

1058
00:42:45.015 --> 00:42:48.767
we are the ones who know how
to cover this. Come watch us.

1059
00:42:48.767 --> 00:42:49.816
Ladies and gentlemen.

1060
00:42:49.816 --> 00:42:53.251
Let's welcome one of our own
to the stage. Mr. John Favreau.

1061
00:42:53.251 --> 00:42:54.674
Hey.

1062
00:42:54.674 --> 00:42:59.428
One year. the
opening shot for Comic-Con Live.

1063
00:42:59.428 --> 00:43:03.466
is Jon Favreau climbing up the stairs.

1064
00:43:03.466 --> 00:43:07.439
reaching out to the fans
and announcing the beginning

1065
00:43:07.439 --> 00:43:10.965
of our Comic-Con coverage
live and inviting

1066
00:43:10.965 --> 00:43:15.257
all of the fans there to come
and see a premier screening

1067
00:43:15.257 --> 00:43:18.945
of Cowboys and Aliens
because we were the audience

1068
00:43:18.945 --> 00:43:22.395
he was trying to reach and
he loved hanging out with us.

1069
00:43:22.395 --> 00:43:23.958
I hope
he knows what he just did.

1070
00:43:23.958 --> 00:43:25.736
Wow. that was awesome.

1071
00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:26.756
That was amazing.

1072
00:43:26.756 --> 00:43:29.116
♪ Well. Jon Favreau's one of my heroes. ♪

1073
00:43:29.116 --> 00:43:31.196

1074
00:43:31.196 --> 00:43:35.603

Aliens" straight bombed. ♪

1075
00:43:35.603 --> 00:43:38.112
♪ Will his career ever
get back on track? ♪

1076
00:43:38.112 --> 00:43:39.894

1077
00:43:39.894 --> 00:43:42.029
Oh shit. he directed Iron Man?

1078
00:43:42.862 --> 00:43:43.695
Nevermind.

1079
00:43:44.599 --> 00:43:46.580
The fact that James Cameron

1080
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.671
made "Attack of the Show" his stop.

1081
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:53.604
to talk on the eve of
the premier of Avatar.

1082
00:43:53.604 --> 00:43:56.197
says so much about what we became.

1083
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:58.957
No other show I
think would have. you know.

1084
00:43:58.957 --> 00:44:02.661
James Cameron come in. and
take a. a folding chair.

1085
00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:05.833
and smash a mannequin
called "Drunkle Ted".

1086
00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:07.628
And I've always wanted to. all right.

1087
00:44:07.628 --> 00:44:08.461
After you sir.

1088
00:44:08.461 --> 00:44:09.419
Here we go.

1089
00:44:12.877 --> 00:44:13.763
You know.
it's just the fact that.

1090
00:44:13.763 --> 00:44:15.777
A - it's James Cameron. you know.

1091
00:44:15.777 --> 00:44:17.559
here's one of the top
directors in his field.

1092
00:44:17.559 --> 00:44:20.769
and he's on our show. and
he's taking a metal chair

1093
00:44:20.769 --> 00:44:22.227
to a dummy.

1094
00:44:22.227 --> 00:44:23.652
James freaking Cameron. everybody!

1095
00:44:24.485 --> 00:44:25.843
Can I keep the chair?
I'm keeping the chair

1096
00:44:25.843 --> 00:44:27.114
You keep that. That is yours.

1097
00:44:27.114 --> 00:44:30.095
He was always very
open to doing bits like that.

1098
00:44:30.095 --> 00:44:32.955
or on his entrance I remember
he came smashing through

1099
00:44:32.955 --> 00:44:35.122
a wall of cardboard boxes.

1100
00:44:36.831 --> 00:44:39.092
Remember me? You owe me an autograph.

1101
00:44:40.041 --> 00:44:43.447
Uh oh. uh oh.

1102
00:44:45.671 --> 00:44:47.243
One of the best
things that I ever wrote

1103
00:44:47.243 --> 00:44:48.759
for the show was

1104
00:44:49.592 --> 00:44:52.070
a recurring bit called
Jeremy's Dragon Corner.

1105
00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:53.894
where Jeremy Hache. who
was one of the producers

1106
00:44:53.894 --> 00:44:57.066
on the show. dressed up in
this like medieval garb.

1107
00:44:57.066 --> 00:44:59.722
And just talked about
how cool dragons were.

1108
00:44:59.722 --> 00:45:02.894
So I saw that movie
Avatar. it was pretty cool.

1109
00:45:03.727 --> 00:45:06.241
Except for the part where all
the avatars had to jump onto

1110
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:09.888
the backs of space dragons
and like have sex with them.

1111
00:45:09.888 --> 00:45:11.977
with their hair or whatever.

1112
00:45:11.977 --> 00:45:15.427
I maintain that sex with
dragons is one of God's special

1113
00:45:15.427 --> 00:45:19.438
mysteries. And if it happens.
the dragon you.

1114
00:45:19.438 --> 00:45:22.195
not the other way around.

1115
00:45:22.195 --> 00:45:24.188
Not cool avatars.

1116
00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:25.021
Not cool.

1117
00:45:25.904 --> 00:45:29.174
And then we had James
Cameron come on and we said.

1118
00:45:29.174 --> 00:45:32.587
Hey. would you mind filming
this rebuttal to Jeremy.

1119
00:45:32.587 --> 00:45:34.640
in "Jeremy's Dragon Corner"?

1120
00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.186
And he was like. yes.
I will totally do this.

1121
00:45:37.186 --> 00:45:40.093
Because James Cameron loved
being on "Attack of the Show".

1122
00:45:40.093 --> 00:45:42.686
and was down for anything
that we made him do.

1123
00:45:42.686 --> 00:45:43.913
He did it all straight faced.

1124
00:45:43.913 --> 00:45:47.728
He did it all totally
seriously. And it's chef's kiss.

1125
00:45:47.728 --> 00:45:50.077
Jeremy. you have no idea what the

1126
00:45:50.077 --> 00:45:51.280
you're talking about.

1127
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.977
I spent eight years
researching space dragon sex.

1128
00:45:53.977 --> 00:45:57.139
and that's exactly how it would happen.

1129
00:45:57.139 --> 00:45:59.106
I'm James Cameron. Goodnight.

1130
00:46:05.307 --> 00:46:08.028
Can we take a second
to dispel some rumors?

1131
00:46:08.028 --> 00:46:09.254
I was not Boba Fetish.

1132
00:46:10.484 --> 00:46:11.734
That wasn't me.

1133
00:46:13.001 --> 00:46:15.019
I actually did get to keep the costume.

1134
00:46:16.921 --> 00:46:18.669
but it wasn't me.

1135
00:46:25.715 --> 00:46:28.739
Those aren't the pants
you're looking for.

1136
00:46:35.937 --> 00:46:38.104
I have felt him my master.

1137
00:46:39.214 --> 00:46:41.203
We mentioned earlier
that there will be some

1138
00:46:41.203 --> 00:46:44.137
new set pieces. but there's a
crazy new thing going on here.

1139
00:46:44.137 --> 00:46:46.820
It looks. it looks like
internets are happening here.

1140
00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:47.869
It's our new Twitter wall.

1141
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:49.670
It's a Twitter wall.

1142
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:52.131
"Attack of the
Show"'s. Twitter wall was.

1143
00:46:52.131 --> 00:46:55.727
if not the first. one
of the first examples

1144
00:46:55.727 --> 00:47:00.061
of integrating social
media into television.

1145
00:47:00.061 --> 00:47:01.301
You'll
see our Twitter wall.

1146
00:47:01.301 --> 00:47:02.925
which we reference often
throughout the show.

1147
00:47:02.925 --> 00:47:05.446
We like to keep things interactive
and get realtime feedback

1148
00:47:05.446 --> 00:47:07.214
from the fans. answer their questions.

1149
00:47:07.214 --> 00:47:10.372
let them ask questions of our
guests or make witty comments.

1150
00:47:10.372 --> 00:47:12.143
So throughout the show. this thing scrolls

1151
00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:14.536
with realtime comments from our audience.

1152
00:47:14.536 --> 00:47:17.068
Our TV finalists come from

1153
00:47:17.068 --> 00:47:20.717
a variety of programs that use Twitter

1154
00:47:20.717 --> 00:47:23.031
to connect with their viewers.

1155
00:47:23.031 --> 00:47:28.031
We actually won two
Shorty awards back to back

1156
00:47:28.083 --> 00:47:32.194
in two years time for best
use of Twitter on television.

1157
00:47:32.194 --> 00:47:34.688
Oh
my God. it's. it's a tie.

1158
00:47:34.688 --> 00:47:35.813
It's a tie. It's a tie.

1159
00:47:35.813 --> 00:47:38.448
Congratulations "Attack of the Show"

1160
00:47:38.448 --> 00:47:39.775
and "Sesame Street".

1161
00:47:41.814 --> 00:47:44.493
The Shorty Awards
being as they called themselves.

1162
00:47:44.493 --> 00:47:46.570
the Academy Awards of the internet.

1163
00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:50.495
But we had already been doing
stuff with the Twitter wall

1164
00:47:50.495 --> 00:47:54.201
for a couple of years before
the Shorty awards even existed.

1165
00:47:54.201 --> 00:47:56.601
I mean. we had to be

1166
00:47:56.601 --> 00:48:00.520
white-listed with Twitter
because of how much data

1167
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.062
we were pulling from Twitter
to get. you know. the feed

1168
00:48:04.062 --> 00:48:06.653
of the "Attack of the Show"
fans giving their reactions

1169
00:48:06.653 --> 00:48:07.798
in real time.

1170
00:48:07.798 --> 00:48:10.199
I think that's kind of rude.

1171
00:48:10.199 --> 00:48:14.381
Whoa. hey.
where did that come from?

1172
00:48:14.381 --> 00:48:17.989
@Megan_Lustofin says uh.

1173
00:48:17.989 --> 00:48:20.709
can Alison and Danny do a "Community" rap?

1174
00:48:20.709 --> 00:48:23.535
Having audience
feedback. audience reaction.

1175
00:48:23.535 --> 00:48:26.309
is what gave this show its energy.

1176
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:27.580
Here we go. here we go.

1177
00:48:28.413 --> 00:48:30.060
Oh. oh. what is up?

1178
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.524
I'm chilling at AOTS with Danny Pudi.

1179
00:48:32.524 --> 00:48:33.357
Oh!

1180
00:48:33.357 --> 00:48:36.072
Shaking out booty in the sister studio.

1181
00:48:36.072 --> 00:48:38.622
Phil Collins. like Emmy Robins.

1182
00:48:38.622 --> 00:48:40.800
that girl I went to high
school with. Just kidding.

1183
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.119
That was a lie. What?

1184
00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:43.319
Whoa!

1185
00:48:43.319 --> 00:48:46.629
The Twitter wall
was all about the fans.

1186
00:48:46.629 --> 00:48:49.104
Some people would come in.
you know. as they could.

1187
00:48:49.104 --> 00:48:51.599
others would show up every so often.

1188
00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:54.387
And then there was the
dedicated core viewer army.

1189
00:48:54.387 --> 00:48:59.213
who if they didn't show up.
you kind of worried about them.

1190
00:49:00.046 --> 00:49:00.929
What's up "Attack of the Show"?

1191
00:49:00.929 --> 00:49:02.038
Hey "Attack of the Show".

1192
00:49:02.038 --> 00:49:04.407
What's up "Attack of the
Show". This is Danny Cubas-

1193
00:49:04.407 --> 00:49:06.615
They were really the drivers.

1194
00:49:06.615 --> 00:49:10.489
They were the taste makers.
they were the influencers

1195
00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:15.489
of "Attack of the Show" before
influencer was even a thing.

1196
00:49:15.712 --> 00:49:17.985
I. yeah. I think
that one of the biggest things

1197
00:49:17.985 --> 00:49:20.309
that was a. a marvel for G4.

1198
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:23.260
is that it created a sense
of community within this

1199
00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.296
small kind of marginalized
community already.

1200
00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:28.343
that people didn't really
look at as cool or as hip.

1201
00:49:28.343 --> 00:49:30.453
And they made these people hip and cool.

1202
00:49:31.286 --> 00:49:33.942
In the eighties.
Nerds were nerds.

1203
00:49:33.942 --> 00:49:38.071
You could not effectively
admit to a lot of people

1204
00:49:38.071 --> 00:49:39.796
that you collected comic books.

1205
00:49:39.796 --> 00:49:41.983
that you played Dungeons and Dragons.

1206
00:49:41.983 --> 00:49:44.038
that you played video games.

1207
00:49:44.038 --> 00:49:45.038
You know today.

1208
00:49:45.038 --> 00:49:48.654
we're talking about the
importance of inclusion.

1209
00:49:48.654 --> 00:49:51.404
And G4. and "Attack of the Show".

1210
00:49:52.528 --> 00:49:56.774
for that particular
generation. was the first spark

1211
00:49:56.774 --> 00:49:59.191
of inclusion on a mass scale.

1212
00:50:00.641 --> 00:50:04.724
That showed people. oh.
there are people like me.

1213
00:50:06.146 --> 00:50:08.729
out there who like what I like.

1214
00:50:09.926 --> 00:50:11.918
and it's okay.

1215
00:50:11.918 --> 00:50:14.325
I feel
like that type of show

1216
00:50:14.325 --> 00:50:16.984
really opened the door for
people to kind of peek in.

1217
00:50:16.984 --> 00:50:19.576
and see. oh. this isn't so bad.

1218
00:50:19.576 --> 00:50:24.025
G4 is to TV
as the MCU is to movies.

1219
00:50:24.025 --> 00:50:26.919
The show helped elevate
nerd culture by saying.

1220
00:50:26.919 --> 00:50:29.785
you know what. not only are we going

1221
00:50:29.785 --> 00:50:32.595
to cater to everything that you love.

1222
00:50:32.595 --> 00:50:35.400
but we're gonna do it in
such a cool. expansive way

1223
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.797
that we're gonna draw new people
in. We're gonna show people

1224
00:50:38.797 --> 00:50:42.645
that the thing you love
isn't lame and for losers.

1225
00:50:42.645 --> 00:50:44.769
it's for everybody.

1226
00:50:44.769 --> 00:50:47.374
You don't have
to play Super Mario.

1227
00:50:47.374 --> 00:50:51.152
We're gonna show you why
other people do play.

1228
00:51:07.344 --> 00:51:10.716
You could bring Star Trek
fan. and Star Wars fans

1229
00:51:10.716 --> 00:51:13.727
and they could sit down
and have a meal together.

1230
00:51:13.727 --> 00:51:17.684
Lewis and Gilbert did
not fight for our nerd rights

1231
00:51:17.684 --> 00:51:21.272
for us to not get along with each other.

1232
00:51:21.272 --> 00:51:24.446
That's the problem with nerd-dom.
and geek-dom. and fandom.

1233
00:51:24.446 --> 00:51:27.386
in this day and age. It's
practically. you know.

1234
00:51:27.386 --> 00:51:31.018
civil war levels of us
versus them when it comes

1235
00:51:31.018 --> 00:51:34.301
to an opinion seemingly in any fandom.

1236
00:51:34.301 --> 00:51:39.301
It's sad to see. because ten
years ago you didn't see that.

1237
00:51:39.933 --> 00:51:42.163
That's where
we really lucked out.

1238
00:51:42.163 --> 00:51:44.966
is that we got the ability
to create essentially

1239
00:51:44.966 --> 00:51:49.266
our own crazy YouTube videos.
We gotta do it together.

1240
00:51:49.266 --> 00:51:52.273
A lot of times some
of the opinions that you read

1241
00:51:52.273 --> 00:51:55.077
are not always nice. As we
know the internet is full of

1242
00:51:55.077 --> 00:51:57.957
sad people sometimes and I
feel like "Attack of the Show"

1243
00:51:57.957 --> 00:52:00.563
fans are never in that. So thank you fans.

1244
00:52:00.563 --> 00:52:05.397
I would like to
thank those G4 TV viewers.

1245
00:52:05.397 --> 00:52:09.406
The ones who showed up every single day

1246
00:52:09.406 --> 00:52:11.364
for "Attack of the Show".

1247
00:52:11.364 --> 00:52:14.862
They were not paid audience
members like you see

1248
00:52:14.862 --> 00:52:17.539
with a lot of live studio
audience shows from Hollywood.

1249
00:52:17.539 --> 00:52:19.334
They were there of their own accord.

1250
00:52:19.334 --> 00:52:22.667
They showed up because they had a voice.

1251
00:52:23.685 --> 00:52:25.973
When it went out the
air. it was like saddest day.

1252
00:52:25.973 --> 00:52:29.166
one of the saddest days of my life.

1253
00:52:29.999 --> 00:52:30.832
This week. Chris Gore went

1254
00:52:30.832 --> 00:52:33.863
to the Asian underground
and came back hurt.

1255
00:52:33.863 --> 00:52:34.696
Aw.

1256
00:52:34.696 --> 00:52:35.529
It's true.

1257
00:52:35.529 --> 00:52:36.362
Well. let's just say that while-

1258
00:52:36.362 --> 00:52:37.195
No reaction?

1259
00:52:37.195 --> 00:52:38.307
Well here's the thing.
It's Chris Gore first.

1260
00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.737
Secondly. while he was covering
some ass kicking films.

1261
00:52:42.737 --> 00:52:45.320
he may have kicked his own ass.

1262
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.280
You go back and
watch the the segments.

1263
00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.997
you'll know that Chris had
to do an intro to the piece.

1264
00:52:49.997 --> 00:52:51.862
And then what he would usually do is.

1265
00:52:51.862 --> 00:52:53.731
talk for a couple
seconds. say where we are.

1266
00:52:53.731 --> 00:52:55.769
and what we are doing. and
then kick off the segment.

1267
00:52:55.769 --> 00:52:58.967
So this one particular
one. he decided to do

1268
00:52:58.967 --> 00:53:00.935
a walk and talk plus a high kick.

1269
00:53:00.935 --> 00:53:01.888
This edition
of Asian Underground.

1270
00:53:01.888 --> 00:53:03.803
prepare to have wisdom
knocked into your brain

1271
00:53:03.803 --> 00:53:04.925
with a high kick.

1272
00:53:05.758 --> 00:53:06.591
With a high kick.

1273
00:53:07.424 --> 00:53:08.628
Ow. oh.

1274
00:53:08.628 --> 00:53:11.411
Ow. ow. ow. ow. my. my jeans.

1275
00:53:11.411 --> 00:53:13.136
The whole
story. including the guy

1276
00:53:13.136 --> 00:53:16.611
that worked there. just
could not stop laughing.

1277
00:53:16.611 --> 00:53:19.130
And I believe that that clip
is probably more memorable

1278
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:21.713
than the entire segment we did.

1279
00:53:23.002 --> 00:53:26.292
I. I think one of the
hardest jobs on the show was

1280
00:53:26.292 --> 00:53:28.557
for standards and practices.

1281
00:53:28.557 --> 00:53:31.807
Our guy Keith had two buttons. One was.

1282
00:53:32.915 --> 00:53:35.979
to bleep out anything that was
said on audio that. you know.

1283
00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:38.876
any swear words. stuff. he.
he'd hit the bleep button.

1284
00:53:38.876 --> 00:53:41.675
The other button he had.
was blur the screen. if he.

1285
00:53:41.675 --> 00:53:45.447
if there was something visual
that wasn't appropriate.

1286
00:53:45.447 --> 00:53:47.822
And I had never seen
that button used before.

1287
00:53:47.822 --> 00:53:51.181
like ever before in my
entire television career.

1288
00:53:51.181 --> 00:53:55.290
But Michael Costa was doing
an interview with Eric Andre.

1289
00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:58.990
Eric stood up and dropped his pants.

1290
00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:01.890
Here are these new boxers
I got. Look at these boxers.

1291
00:54:03.545 --> 00:54:04.617
Eric

1292
00:54:04.617 --> 00:54:06.072
And you would think
it would stop right there.

1293
00:54:06.072 --> 00:54:07.082
Julie gave me a card request-

1294
00:54:09.581 --> 00:54:13.100
But then he proceeded
to pull down the boxers

1295
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:18.100
as well and he kind of tucked
his junk in between his legs.

1296
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:21.743
It's okay you can do
whatever you want. it's G4.

1297
00:54:21.743 --> 00:54:26.177
And you know. everyone
was just in shock and awe.

1298
00:54:26.177 --> 00:54:29.467
In the control room. we
could see it in our monitors.

1299
00:54:29.467 --> 00:54:33.408
But in the return feed. the
feed that you would see at home.

1300
00:54:33.408 --> 00:54:36.593
the whole feed was just blurred.

1301
00:54:36.593 --> 00:54:41.336
And that was the first time in
history that I've seen that.

1302
00:54:41.336 --> 00:54:45.547
And I am kind of proud that
I was there for that moment.

1303
00:54:45.547 --> 00:54:48.311
"Don't Trust the B- in Apartment 23".

1304
00:54:48.311 --> 00:54:50.815
Are you guys rounding
up because I took my penis

1305
00:54:50.815 --> 00:54:52.378
and my fake vagina out.

1306
00:54:52.378 --> 00:54:53.601
Now over to Candace!

1307
00:54:53.601 --> 00:54:56.420
Not all of those
things that happened on the show

1308
00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:01.192
would be acceptable by today's
more conservative standards.

1309
00:55:01.192 --> 00:55:04.024
Pedo Bear was
a regular gag on the show.

1310
00:55:04.024 --> 00:55:05.430
That would not happen now.

1311
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.446
Or to have the gag
between Candace and Sarah.

1312
00:55:08.446 --> 00:55:11.733
You know where every time
Candace would say. "I'm so sure".

1313
00:55:11.733 --> 00:55:14.220
Sarah would grab her and
put her into her chest.

1314
00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:16.537
Oh my gosh guys. "I'm so sure".

1315
00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:21.683
The infamous
fat-suit gag. which started off

1316
00:55:21.683 --> 00:55:24.995
really clever. just ended up
being like patently offensive.

1317
00:55:24.995 --> 00:55:26.348
To the point. one of the.

1318
00:55:26.348 --> 00:55:29.006
was one of our production
management was gonna walk.

1319
00:55:29.006 --> 00:55:32.113
That's right. 20
gallons of cottage cheese

1320
00:55:32.113 --> 00:55:34.763
in your very old souvenir wheelbarrow.

1321
00:55:34.763 --> 00:55:36.327
Hey Kevin. Kevin.

1322
00:55:36.327 --> 00:55:37.498
Joy in a wheelbarrow!

1323
00:55:37.498 --> 00:55:40.466
Hey. go diving. go diving for cupcakes.

1324
00:55:40.466 --> 00:55:43.914
That was a massive ordeal.

1325
00:55:43.914 --> 00:55:45.940
It ended
up being bad spirit.

1326
00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.003
but they got away with it.

1327
00:55:51.412 --> 00:55:54.624
Sure you can have a sexy female heroine.

1328
00:55:54.624 --> 00:55:57.093
but you can't have her wear
what Sara Jean Underwood wore

1329
00:55:57.093 --> 00:55:57.926
as "Bustice".

1330
00:56:03.646 --> 00:56:04.791
What the hell is happening?

1331
00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.832
Some of the fuel rods won't
go back into the cooling tank.

1332
00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:11.857
Fear not citizens.
Bustice is on the case.

1333
00:56:13.523 --> 00:56:17.068
♪ Yeah. so fine. ♪

1334
00:56:17.068 --> 00:56:18.984
There's
just no way you could have

1335
00:56:18.984 --> 00:56:22.790
someone use a stripper pole
to disarm a nuclear bomb.

1336
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:23.623
It's not healthy.

1337
00:56:23.623 --> 00:56:26.029
I mean. even
the. the hacking a pig

1338
00:56:26.029 --> 00:56:28.166
in half with a sword.

1339
00:56:28.166 --> 00:56:29.652
"Wiffle Bat Fight Club".

1340
00:56:29.652 --> 00:56:30.485
Let's fight.

1341
00:56:34.473 --> 00:56:36.437
And we also had the. uh.

1342
00:56:36.437 --> 00:56:39.314
we were shooting producers
with. you know. BB guns.

1343
00:56:39.314 --> 00:56:40.718
Hache. you feel that?

1344
00:56:40.718 --> 00:56:42.286
I mean. just
anything that was abusive

1345
00:56:42.286 --> 00:56:44.174
towards the writers or producers.

1346
00:56:44.174 --> 00:56:46.580
You. you can't do that anymore.

1347
00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:48.920
I did a lot of on
camera drinking back then.

1348
00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.508
Basically they're like.
you're gonna try a beer

1349
00:56:50.508 --> 00:56:52.671
from every single booth.
and then you're gonna do

1350
00:56:52.671 --> 00:56:53.504
a blood alcohol test.

1351
00:56:54.449 --> 00:56:55.715
Okay.

1352
00:56:55.715 --> 00:56:56.548
2.7.

1353
00:56:57.381 --> 00:56:59.302
You should be dead.

1354
00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:11.310
I masturbate a lot. and I've
never really had real sex.

1355
00:57:11.383 --> 00:57:13.750
I was just curious. Am I still a virgin?

1356
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:15.754
No. you're a whore.

1357
00:57:15.754 --> 00:57:18.805
Masturbating does not mean
that you're no longer a virgin.

1358
00:57:18.805 --> 00:57:19.638
by any means.

1359
00:57:19.638 --> 00:57:21.088
It's okay to ask the question.

1360
00:57:21.088 --> 00:57:23.284
There are no stupid questions. But-

1361
00:57:23.284 --> 00:57:24.701
I'm just kidding.
It was a smart question.

1362
00:57:24.701 --> 00:57:26.979
No. no. no. no. Don't listen to her.

1363
00:57:26.979 --> 00:57:29.396
I could get away with
every single thing I did.

1364
00:57:29.396 --> 00:57:31.174
I think Olivia could get away with it.

1365
00:57:31.174 --> 00:57:32.682
But even when you were talking about.

1366
00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:34.014
oh. when we covered the porn awards.

1367
00:57:34.014 --> 00:57:36.084
and we were told to treat
it in a clinical way.

1368
00:57:36.084 --> 00:57:39.076
I guarantee you it would've
been all female crew.

1369
00:57:39.076 --> 00:57:42.563
all female talent. Because men are not

1370
00:57:42.563 --> 00:57:47.563
safe today. from saying the
wrong thing around a woman.

1371
00:57:47.807 --> 00:57:49.780
That was horrifying.
Just like. all right.

1372
00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.337
we're talking with Cassidy Ray.

1373
00:57:51.337 --> 00:57:53.289
She's nominated tonight for "Double Anal".

1374
00:57:53.289 --> 00:57:56.437
and "Best Penetration Scene"
Cassidy. how do you feel?

1375
00:57:56.437 --> 00:57:58.191
And what a. what an honor. huh?

1376
00:57:58.191 --> 00:58:01.669
"We are
just excited to be here. um.

1377
00:58:01.669 --> 00:58:02.502
at the AVNs".

1378
00:58:02.502 --> 00:58:04.131
and then they'd
see a friend across the room.

1379
00:58:04.131 --> 00:58:07.317
and they'd go. "lick my tits! Whoo!

1380
00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:10.091
Yeah bitch. you're such a slut!

1381
00:58:10.091 --> 00:58:12.298
Alexis Texas is a slut!

1382
00:58:12.298 --> 00:58:15.194
I've been reading comic
books for like 25 years.

1383
00:58:15.194 --> 00:58:17.032
I don't think I've ever seen "Butt Woman"

1384
00:58:17.032 --> 00:58:19.001
I am sure that we did stuff

1385
00:58:19.001 --> 00:58:21.975
that would not fly today. I am sure of it.

1386
00:58:21.975 --> 00:58:24.960
And I can guarantee you
that none of it was done

1387
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:25.793
with bad intent.

1388
00:58:28.153 --> 00:58:30.858
You know. as with
anything. context is key.

1389
00:58:30.858 --> 00:58:32.691
But we were like family.

1390
00:58:32.691 --> 00:58:35.197
and you. you put your
guard down around family.

1391
00:58:35.197 --> 00:58:37.297
you're a little more open around family.

1392
00:58:37.297 --> 00:58:41.130
and you're definitely
more blue around family.

1393
00:58:42.168 --> 00:58:44.850
Where people will look at a broadcast

1394
00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:48.400
that we did back then
today. and think. ooh.

1395
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.529
it was always in the spirit of fun.

1396
00:58:51.529 --> 00:58:52.362
"Murder Master Class"

1397
00:58:53.195 --> 00:58:54.767
is a fun. easy-to-use.
audio lecture series

1398
00:58:54.767 --> 00:58:56.455
that will get you out
of the amateur league

1399
00:58:56.455 --> 00:58:58.456
and into the pros. Guarantee it.

1400
00:58:58.456 --> 00:58:59.500
Maybe it's good that we don't do

1401
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.678
that stuff anymore. There
is a backlash to that. like

1402
00:59:02.678 --> 00:59:06.218
correctness culture. which I
think is kind of unfounded.

1403
00:59:06.218 --> 00:59:09.681
Most of that is done in a way
that's good with good intents.

1404
00:59:09.681 --> 00:59:13.175
but you also have this flip
side of people who kind of think

1405
00:59:13.175 --> 00:59:16.309
that they can say anything
and if you're being offensive.

1406
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:18.159
but you're acknowledging
that you're being offensive.

1407
00:59:18.159 --> 00:59:19.831
that that makes it okay.

1408
00:59:19.831 --> 00:59:22.823
And I've never really thought
that that flies. you know.

1409
00:59:22.823 --> 00:59:25.083
I think a lot of things
are are for the better.

1410
00:59:25.083 --> 00:59:27.659
I mean obviously. we have to
be aware and and conscious

1411
00:59:27.659 --> 00:59:30.420
of people's feelings and
things of that nature.

1412
00:59:31.728 --> 00:59:34.604
But we were probably offending
people left and right

1413
00:59:34.604 --> 00:59:35.437
everyday.

1414
00:59:37.103 --> 00:59:37.936
Excuse me.

1415
00:59:37.936 --> 00:59:38.894
Go for Power Girl.

1416
00:59:38.894 --> 00:59:41.319
Power
Girl. You've got to help us.

1417
00:59:41.319 --> 00:59:43.564
I got my submarine
lodged in the ice up here

1418
00:59:43.564 --> 00:59:44.976
in the Bering Strait.

1419
00:59:44.976 --> 00:59:47.106
You've got good
speakers on those things.

1420
00:59:47.106 --> 00:59:48.837
How'd you get stuck. captain?

1421
00:59:48.837 --> 00:59:52.214
I mean. could you do
anything in any. at any time

1422
00:59:52.214 --> 00:59:54.960
ten years in the future?
I mean. I don't know.

1423
00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.486
I mean. I'm down with
being kind and empathetic

1424
00:59:57.486 --> 01:00:00.982
to all people. However.
I think the woke culture

1425
01:00:00.982 --> 01:00:05.982
has gone too far and I'm a
progressive California liberal.

1426
01:00:06.317 --> 01:00:08.272
I think when it comes to comedy.

1427
01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.544
you should have carte blanche.

1428
01:00:10.544 --> 01:00:11.761
Pillow fight!

1429
01:00:11.761 --> 01:00:14.073
In my opinion. it's
sad that a lot of the stuff

1430
01:00:14.073 --> 01:00:17.260
that we were doing back
then would never happen now.

1431
01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:19.703
Because you know. we have
to dilute everything.

1432
01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:22.543
and there's just such
more hypersensitivity.

1433
01:00:22.543 --> 01:00:26.120
and who's gonna be offended.
and some of that stuff

1434
01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.441
that happened back in the
days. I mean. that was just

1435
01:00:28.441 --> 01:00:29.441
comedy gold.

1436
01:00:30.571 --> 01:00:33.827
But there's something so
innately good about it.

1437
01:00:33.827 --> 01:00:36.645
that you can't deny
that you wanna watch it.

1438
01:00:36.645 --> 01:00:38.932
You have to
have that kind of mentality

1439
01:00:38.932 --> 01:00:41.380
that it's just humor.
They were good at that.

1440
01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.351
And so how do you criticize
somebody who's saying. no.

1441
01:00:44.351 --> 01:00:46.796
this is exactly what we are.
They're not apologizing for it.

1442
01:00:46.796 --> 01:00:49.075
Right? Ughh. off!

1443
01:00:49.075 --> 01:00:50.316
It doesn't
make it right all the time.

1444
01:00:50.316 --> 01:00:54.297
but it's just something about
when you accept what you're

1445
01:00:54.297 --> 01:00:57.961
putting out there and back
it. that people just go. ah.

1446
01:00:57.961 --> 01:01:00.249
it's that's what they do. You
know? That's who they are.

1447
01:01:00.249 --> 01:01:01.231
Because at the end of the day.

1448
01:01:01.231 --> 01:01:04.111
"Attack of the Show" was.
it was interested in things.

1449
01:01:04.111 --> 01:01:06.267
It never took itself seriously.

1450
01:01:06.267 --> 01:01:08.917
It made fun of itself
before it made fun of you.

1451
01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:10.802
If it did make fun of
you. it was always done

1452
01:01:10.802 --> 01:01:13.534
in a friendly manner. And
at the end of the day.

1453
01:01:13.534 --> 01:01:14.925
we're all nerds on the internet.

1454
01:01:14.925 --> 01:01:17.067
And I'm. I'm a sexy Washington Monument.

1455
01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.279
It's ironic because I'm wearing a bikini.

1456
01:01:20.279 --> 01:01:22.334
but this is historic landmark
is shaped like a giant penis-

1457
01:01:22.334 --> 01:01:23.215
Okay. all
right. all right. We're good.

1458
01:01:23.215 --> 01:01:24.332

him and Olivia together

1472
01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:58.587
were what most people remember
about "Attack of the Show".

1473
01:01:58.587 --> 01:02:00.023
She would always
get kind of stuck doing

1474
01:02:00.023 --> 01:02:02.966
the crazy field shit. I remember
her remarking being like.

1475
01:02:02.966 --> 01:02:04.936
this is what I gotta do to
be in Hollywood. You know?

1476
01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:08.802
And then of course. she leaves.

1477
01:02:08.802 --> 01:02:10.990
Olivia leaving first was.

1478
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:14.248
it was a big hit for the show
because it changed the outlook

1479
01:02:14.248 --> 01:02:17.628
and. and the make-up of
the show by quite a bit.

1480
01:02:17.628 --> 01:02:19.611
She was getting
called up to the big leagues.

1481
01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:21.632
I would say. And you know. getting offers

1482
01:02:21.632 --> 01:02:23.299
on movies and stuff.

1483
01:02:24.245 --> 01:02:26.579
I think the Network was giving
her a hard time about that.

1484
01:02:26.579 --> 01:02:29.156
So she took a stand in.
in certain ways and.

1485
01:02:29.156 --> 01:02:31.728
and she did what was best
for her. and for her career.

1486
01:02:31.728 --> 01:02:33.180
Olivia knew
she wanted to be a star.

1487
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.662
and she was very good at getting noticed.

1488
01:02:35.662 --> 01:02:37.340
She was good at what she did.

1489
01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.919
And you know. she ended
up a freaking movie star.

1490
01:02:39.919 --> 01:02:40.752
Rock on.

1491
01:02:43.715 --> 01:02:46.017
We all wanted
to be very supportive of her

1492
01:02:46.017 --> 01:02:48.862
leaving to fully pursue her acting career.

1493
01:02:49.695 --> 01:02:51.855
It's like we could have done
that. Somebody was saying.

1494
01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:54.798
if you're gonna be a serious
actress now you've gotta

1495
01:02:54.798 --> 01:02:58.103
get away from the girl
who jumped in the pot.

1496
01:02:58.103 --> 01:02:59.066
She's done some great stuff.

1497
01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:01.531
"Office Christmas Party" is awesome.

1498
01:03:01.531 --> 01:03:03.339
There's so many people
that we worked with.

1499
01:03:03.339 --> 01:03:04.609
that are in that movie.

1500
01:03:04.609 --> 01:03:05.888
I also think that she knew what

1501
01:03:05.888 --> 01:03:08.496
that show was for her. You know.
it was the showcase for her

1502
01:03:08.496 --> 01:03:11.311
that got her where she is today
for. for any of the talent

1503
01:03:11.311 --> 01:03:13.549
that was on that show. They
were able to be themselves.

1504
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:15.805
and. and show their own personalities.

1505
01:03:15.805 --> 01:03:18.361
and show what they're capable
of. And it's basically.

1506
01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:21.730
you know. a 10 year audition
tape for all those guys.

1507
01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:24.101
I do remember
a lot of the viewers

1508
01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:27.733
being very bummed on Olivia's last days.

1509
01:03:27.733 --> 01:03:30.421
And it was. a lot of the
show's not gonna be the same

1510
01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:33.671

01:03:59.011 --> 01:04:01.380
for the next couple months
we were on a rotating basis.

1521
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:05.239
Just. you know. live
screen-testing other co-hosts.

1522
01:04:05.239 --> 01:04:07.162
and putting 'em through the ringer.

1523
01:04:07.995 --> 01:04:09.618
Listen. Bailey. when you get to work.

1524
01:04:09.618 --> 01:04:10.775
I only ask two things.

1525
01:04:10.775 --> 01:04:12.032
One. be limber.

1526
01:04:12.032 --> 01:04:14.894
And two. be ready to kick some ass.

1527
01:04:14.894 --> 01:04:17.624
It doesn't make any
sense. Kevin. where are we?

1528
01:04:17.624 --> 01:04:20.015
It's a new year. new co-host.

1529
01:04:20.944 --> 01:04:21.861
New studio.

1530
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:27.160
Watch your corners. protect
your neck. Try not to get bit.

1531
01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:27.993
What?

1532
01:04:27.993 --> 01:04:29.706
Let's go bitches!

1533
01:04:40.803 --> 01:04:42.717
Sorry! Ugh!

1534
01:04:42.717 --> 01:04:44.190
And
so when it was announced

1535
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:47.216
within the network that they
were gonna go with Candace.

1536
01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:50.024
they wanted to do a whole
week of building her up.

1537
01:04:50.024 --> 01:04:52.684
kind of giving her a nerd bootcamp.

1538
01:04:52.684 --> 01:04:54.179
So excited.

1539
01:04:54.179 --> 01:04:55.076
We ready?

1540
01:04:55.076 --> 01:04:56.720
I'm ready.

1541
01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.695
It
eventually ended with us

1542
01:05:00.695 --> 01:05:04.415
bringing her out on a parapet to the set.

1543
01:05:04.415 --> 01:05:06.424
And then that was sort of
like the big announcement.

1544
01:05:06.424 --> 01:05:07.257
Big hurrah.

1545
01:05:07.257 --> 01:05:09.660
I'm so proud and excited
to introduce the new co-host

1546
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:13.014
of "Attack of the Show". Please welcome!

1547
01:05:13.014 --> 01:05:13.847
Candace Bailey.

1548
01:05:13.847 --> 01:05:14.999
Yeah!

1549
01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:20.097
Dynamic of
the show changed a little

1550
01:05:20.097 --> 01:05:22.420
because you just. it's like
anything. a sports team

1551
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.267
or anything. when you
bring in a new person.

1552
01:05:24.267 --> 01:05:25.828
you gotta figure each other out.

1553
01:05:25.828 --> 01:05:27.988
I mean it was just
time for things to change

1554
01:05:27.988 --> 01:05:29.647
as they always do.

1555
01:05:30.613 --> 01:05:31.530
Oh right.

1556
01:05:33.472 --> 01:05:35.255
Those poor people.

1557
01:05:38.164 --> 01:05:39.037
It's tragic.

1558
01:05:40.428 --> 01:05:41.284
Totes tragic.

1559
01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.046
With Olivia
leaving. we always felt that

1560
01:05:45.046 --> 01:05:47.368
like the co-host. as long
as there was chemistry.

1561
01:05:47.368 --> 01:05:49.749
hosts could change out
and the show would go on.

1562
01:05:49.749 --> 01:05:52.544
But we said if Kevin was to leave.

1563
01:05:52.544 --> 01:05:54.563
that would be the end of the show.

1564
01:05:54.563 --> 01:05:56.908
And then Kevin announced
that he was leaving.

1565
01:05:57.741 --> 01:05:58.574
Uh.
the kitty cat has been

1566
01:05:58.574 --> 01:06:00.907
let out of the burlap sack. everybody.

1567
01:06:00.907 --> 01:06:02.715
The press release went out today.

1568
01:06:02.715 --> 01:06:05.732
I am in fact leaving "Attack
of the Show". and G4.

1569
01:06:05.732 --> 01:06:06.574
at the end of this month.

1570
01:06:06.574 --> 01:06:07.407
Boo!

1571
01:06:07.407 --> 01:06:08.945
Aww. boo!

1572
01:06:08.945 --> 01:06:09.778
Boo.

1573
01:06:09.778 --> 01:06:12.736
That's. that's one possible
reaction. Thank you Candace.

1574
01:06:17.786 --> 01:06:20.261
To me. Kevin was the show.

1575
01:06:20.261 --> 01:06:22.550
but he saw the writing on the
wall. as well. And I think

1576
01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:25.653
he wanted to get out like a
lot of people do when they're

1577
01:06:25.653 --> 01:06:28.312
at the top of their game.
rather than being forced out

1578
01:06:28.312 --> 01:06:30.364
at a time. You know. he got to choose when

1579
01:06:30.364 --> 01:06:32.877
and how he was gonna leave.
And although it was sad.

1580
01:06:32.877 --> 01:06:36.195
you know. it was his decision and the show

1581
01:06:36.195 --> 01:06:39.714
definitely changed after that
'cause I. I think he felt that

1582
01:06:39.714 --> 01:06:42.327
it wasn't the same. but the.
the magic was gone at that time

1583
01:06:42.327 --> 01:06:44.727
for him. and he wasn't
feeling like. you know.

1584
01:06:44.727 --> 01:06:46.632
it was the show that it used to be.

1585
01:06:46.632 --> 01:06:48.470
Well I respect him a lot for. you know.

1586
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:51.303
being able to walk away from that.

1587
01:06:55.232 --> 01:06:58.178
When he announced
that he was leaving.

1588
01:06:58.178 --> 01:07:01.953
it was shocking. but also
not at all surprising.

1589
01:07:01.953 --> 01:07:04.709
I hate to be overdramatic.
but it was like. when.

1590
01:07:04.709 --> 01:07:08.924
on his final day. or the
day after his final day.

1591
01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:11.184
it was like losing a relative.

1592
01:07:11.184 --> 01:07:15.061
Like you turn around and you
still expect them to be there.

1593
01:07:15.061 --> 01:07:16.394
but they're not.

1594
01:07:45.648 --> 01:07:47.890
It was like you ripped
out the soul of the show.

1595
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:51.723
and after that nothing
would ever be the same.

Four. three-

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:35.117
If you look
at how "Attack" changed

1608
01:08:35.117 --> 01:08:37.373
all of the late night
shows. All of a sudden now.

1609
01:08:37.373 --> 01:08:40.390
they were all having a game and
they were all having stunts.

1610
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:44.356
And you look at what
happened with Hardwick.

1611
01:08:44.356 --> 01:08:46.460
With "Talking Dead".

1612
01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:49.677
He did that with "Heroes" and
some of the other shows on G4.

1613
01:08:49.677 --> 01:08:52.949
long before AMC. With everybody going out.

1614
01:08:52.949 --> 01:08:56.680
and doing their thing and
taking over. I was really proud.

1615
01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.914
yeah. to see that.

1616
01:08:57.914 --> 01:09:00.150
Two years prior
to the ending of G4.

1617
01:09:00.150 --> 01:09:04.855
we were all at E3. and an
article had gone out about how

1618
01:09:04.855 --> 01:09:08.948
the UFC was interested in
purchasing G4 but then that deal

1619
01:09:08.948 --> 01:09:11.508
didn't go through. And that
was like a shock to everyone.

1620
01:09:11.508 --> 01:09:13.186
because nobody knew that the network

1621
01:09:13.186 --> 01:09:14.210
was actually up for sale.

1622
01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:16.993
After that. it was kind
of on the radar that hey.

1623
01:09:16.993 --> 01:09:19.884
the higher-ups at this company
are looking to ditch G4.

1624
01:09:19.884 --> 01:09:21.035
To me that was
the beginning of the end.

1625
01:09:21.035 --> 01:09:23.122
Both of the network. and
"Attack of the Show".

1626
01:09:23.122 --> 01:09:24.972
and frankly the dream.

1627
01:09:24.972 --> 01:09:26.519
There's a great saying.

1628
01:09:26.519 --> 01:09:28.285
There's three sides to every story.

1629
01:09:28.285 --> 01:09:31.497
There's yours. there's mine and
there's the cold hard truth.

1630
01:09:31.497 --> 01:09:34.253
Many people may have a
different memory of exactly

1631
01:09:34.253 --> 01:09:37.991
what happened and what the
truth is for how it ended.

1632
01:09:37.991 --> 01:09:39.624
But to paraphrase Hamilton.

1633
01:09:39.624 --> 01:09:42.809
I was in the room where
it happened. I saw it all.

1634
01:09:42.809 --> 01:09:45.968
There was no conspiracy against G4.

1635
01:09:45.968 --> 01:09:48.231
It was a simple business decision.

1636
01:09:48.231 --> 01:09:51.441
Comcast had just bought NBCUniversal.

1637
01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:54.488
All of the cable networks
from both companies

1638
01:09:54.488 --> 01:09:57.258
got combined together into one big group.

1639
01:09:57.258 --> 01:10:00.170
And the person that was put
in charge of that group.

1640
01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:01.420
didn't like G4.

1641
01:10:11.671 --> 01:10:13.247
And I know
there was a story where.

1642
01:10:13.247 --> 01:10:15.881
the production was up on the
floor near the elevators.

1643
01:10:15.881 --> 01:10:20.462
where they sat. And the woman
who was running everything

1644
01:10:20.462 --> 01:10:23.755
had come in with the Kardashians.
and she was embarrassed

1645
01:10:23.755 --> 01:10:26.134
at having to walk through the G4 section.

1646
01:10:26.134 --> 01:10:29.536
because of all the toys.
and the "Squiddy" costume.

1647
01:10:29.536 --> 01:10:31.400
and all the nerd stuff.

1648
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.689
And so she first had them all
moved away from the elevator.

1649
01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:37.521
and out of sight. And
then you could see that

1650
01:10:37.521 --> 01:10:40.448
they weren't gonna develop
and support for G4.

1651
01:10:40.448 --> 01:10:42.961
They wanted it gone and out of the way.

1652
01:10:42.961 --> 01:10:45.860
Within a
month. the president. my boss.

1653
01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:50.784
was gone. as they clearly
planned to wind down G4.

1654
01:10:50.784 --> 01:10:53.384
and replace it with Esquire network.

1655
01:10:53.384 --> 01:10:54.748
G4 went away.

1656
01:10:54.748 --> 01:10:57.048
Esquire network was launched.

1657
01:10:57.048 --> 01:10:58.960
We knew there
were gonna be changes. right?

1658
01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.099
And the idea was to make G4.

1659
01:11:02.099 --> 01:11:05.506
a Bravo-style network for men. right?

1660
01:11:05.506 --> 01:11:09.225
Upscale. urban. to some
degree hipster. I. listen.

1661
01:11:09.225 --> 01:11:11.897
I'm not a fan of it. it wasn't
for me. but I understood

1662
01:11:11.897 --> 01:11:13.964
the business case for it.
right? There is a good

1663
01:11:13.964 --> 01:11:17.944
business case for trying
to make the G4 audience

1664
01:11:17.944 --> 01:11:22.000
more valuable to advertisers
and to the cable affiliates.

1665
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.016
Esquire
network did not last very long.

1666
01:11:25.016 --> 01:11:29.557
They just moved on. It was a
business decision. that sadly

1667
01:11:29.557 --> 01:11:30.640
was based on.

1668
01:11:31.565 --> 01:11:33.565
us losing our champions.

1669
01:11:34.407 --> 01:11:36.784
When you don't have a
champion at the highest levels

1670
01:11:36.784 --> 01:11:39.800
of the corporate culture.
The numbers were there.

1671
01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.737
the profit was there.
the growth was there.

1672
01:11:42.737 --> 01:11:45.544
the champion was no longer there.

1673
01:11:45.544 --> 01:11:49.392

1684
01:12:18.721 --> 01:12:22.410
My observation
was always that they did not

1685
01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:24.781
provide the support. What
they were trying to do.

1686
01:12:24.781 --> 01:12:29.365
was surround it with "Cops"
and "Cheaters". and shows that

1687
01:12:29.365 --> 01:12:30.894
didn't have anything to
do with it. And then when

1688
01:12:30.894 --> 01:12:33.127
they finally did have the
money. they did "Hurl!".

1689
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.513
I mean stuff that didn't
fit our audience at all.

1690
01:12:36.513 --> 01:12:39.053
And I would just turn and look
at them in the control room

1691
01:12:39.053 --> 01:12:42.701
and say. our audience is people like me.

1692
01:12:42.701 --> 01:12:45.793
who is wearing cargo shorts and a t-shirt.

1693
01:12:45.793 --> 01:12:48.600
and doesn't really care about
fashion. or fine liquors.

1694
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.468
or any of this stuff. And it
just didn't make any sense.

1695
01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:55.388
So I think they just got further.
and further away from like

1696
01:12:55.388 --> 01:12:57.138
who our audience was.

1697
01:13:00.545 --> 01:13:03.722
Unfortunately
a network that is allowed

1698
01:13:03.722 --> 01:13:06.529
to go off. and be wild and
creative because it was.

1699
01:13:06.529 --> 01:13:10.886
in a sense. a start- up.
ultimately couldn't survive

1700
01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:15.074
in a mega conglomerate
where it's all about brands.

1701
01:13:15.074 --> 01:13:18.277
and bottom lines and spreadsheets.

1702
01:13:18.277 --> 01:13:21.622
Somebody
from G4 put up a meme.

1703
01:13:21.622 --> 01:13:24.166
"well played Mayans well played".

1704
01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:29.605
We. uh. always had
our conspiracy theories.

1705
01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:31.442
The script read-throughs at "X-Play".

1706
01:13:31.442 --> 01:13:34.127
we were always in this
room at NBCUniversal.

1707
01:13:34.127 --> 01:13:37.088
They had a dry erase board
on three different walls.

1708
01:13:37.088 --> 01:13:40.010
and it was for each network
that they were running in there.

1709
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:42.139
G4 had its own wall.

1710
01:13:42.139 --> 01:13:43.948
E! Entertainment had its own wall.

1711
01:13:43.948 --> 01:13:45.539
Style network had its own wall.

1712
01:13:45.539 --> 01:13:47.720
So they would list the
programming that was coming up

1713
01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.865
for the next three months. I
would point that out to Jerry.

1714
01:13:50.865 --> 01:13:52.653
It's like. oh we're okay
because look. you know.

1715
01:13:52.653 --> 01:13:55.091
they are still listing
shows on. on the whiteboard

1716
01:13:55.091 --> 01:13:57.729
for the next three
months. And then one day.

1717
01:13:57.729 --> 01:14:01.095
all of a sudden. there was
nothing for months ahead

1718
01:14:01.095 --> 01:14:04.192
to come on G4. And I
said. Jerry. we're done.

1719
01:14:04.192 --> 01:14:05.025
It was
getting to the point.

1720
01:14:05.025 --> 01:14:06.504
we couldn't do anything about it.

1721
01:14:06.504 --> 01:14:08.182
Just. it's making me kind of sick.

1722
01:14:08.182 --> 01:14:10.782
So it was a little relief.
when they called everybody in

1723
01:14:10.782 --> 01:14:12.461
the all hands meeting.

1724
01:14:12.461 --> 01:14:14.829
They brought every employee of G4

1725
01:14:14.829 --> 01:14:19.256
into this big conference room
and they had security there

1726
01:14:19.256 --> 01:14:21.710
as well. And when they
made the general call

1727
01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:23.846
for this meeting. everyone
knew what the announcement

1728
01:14:23.846 --> 01:14:27.389
was gonna be. and all
the G4 employees came in

1729
01:14:27.389 --> 01:14:29.746
and it was like a party.
It was like. it was already

1730
01:14:29.746 --> 01:14:30.579
like a big wrap party.

1731
01:14:31.412 --> 01:14:33.399
People coming in. high-fiving and stuff.

1732
01:14:33.399 --> 01:14:35.902
I think it wasn't the
reaction that the executives

1733
01:14:35.902 --> 01:14:37.895
thought was gonna happen it.

1734
01:14:37.895 --> 01:14:39.666
It actually
was a fun atmosphere

1735
01:14:39.666 --> 01:14:41.261
with all of us together.

1736
01:14:41.261 --> 01:14:43.244
And I think there was a lot of relief.

1737
01:14:43.244 --> 01:14:45.428
We just kind of went
in there and did what we.

1738
01:14:45.428 --> 01:14:48.285
the only thing we could do.
and we just kind of celebrated.

1739
01:14:48.285 --> 01:14:50.911
And that was a funny
standout moment to me.

1740
01:14:50.911 --> 01:14:53.644
Because I'm sure those
executives were pretty shocked.

1741
01:14:53.644 --> 01:14:55.849
Like why are these people so happy?

1742
01:14:55.849 --> 01:14:57.742
I hate to sound like a cliche.

1743
01:14:57.742 --> 01:15:01.143
but it's like a family. All
of these people that you see

1744
01:15:01.143 --> 01:15:05.533
for ten hours. some twelve
hours a day. sometimes longer.

1745
01:15:05.533 --> 01:15:07.829
They're. you see them
more than your own family.

1746
01:15:07.829 --> 01:15:11.678
A lot of friendships that I
curated for ten years were.

1747
01:15:11.678 --> 01:15:12.902
instantly gone.

1748
01:15:12.902 --> 01:15:15.951
To lose all that overnight
in the blink of a eye.

1749
01:15:15.951 --> 01:15:18.105
It's a lot of loss.

1750
01:15:18.105 --> 01:15:20.299
It definitely felt
like the end of an era.

1751
01:15:20.299 --> 01:15:22.641
that wasn't gonna ever happen again.

1752
01:15:45.981 --> 01:15:48.454
Thank you all! We love you.

1753
01:15:48.454 --> 01:15:50.822
We love you! We love you!

1754
01:15:50.822 --> 01:15:52.739
Goodnight. everybody!

1755
01:15:57.625 --> 01:15:59.720
Current day
creators have a lot to

1756
01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.558
nod their heads at. to
the original G4 people.

1757
01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:06.021
because we kind of set that
stage and opened that gateway

1758
01:16:06.021 --> 01:16:08.197
for number one. Anyone can do this.

1759
01:16:08.197 --> 01:16:10.458
All you need is a camera and a good idea.

1760
01:16:10.458 --> 01:16:12.185
That to me is a huge plus.

1761
01:16:12.185 --> 01:16:13.349
And number two.

1762
01:16:13.349 --> 01:16:18.349
Don't be afraid to fly your
geek flag. and. uh. and go niche

1763
01:16:18.429 --> 01:16:20.731
with your interests because
there's other people out there

1764
01:16:20.731 --> 01:16:21.697
like you.

1765
01:16:21.697 --> 01:16:24.479
We had magic.
We didn't have a lot of money.

1766
01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:28.387
but we had magic. We had
passion. we had creative freedom.

1767
01:16:28.387 --> 01:16:31.157
We had an environment where
people respected each other.

1768
01:16:31.157 --> 01:16:34.585
bounced ideas off each
other. challenged each other.

1769
01:16:34.585 --> 01:16:36.786
to come up with the best possible content.

1770
01:16:36.786 --> 01:16:40.182
Everyone behind the scenes and
in front of the camera at G4.

1771
01:16:40.182 --> 01:16:44.189
created content without
feeling manufactured at all.

1772
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:48.829
It felt natural. G4 reached
an audience that no one else

1773
01:16:48.829 --> 01:16:52.613
knew how to get. And it's
only after that is gone.

1774
01:16:52.613 --> 01:16:55.993
when you say to yourself.
oh. when they told me

1775
01:16:55.993 --> 01:16:59.519
how good we had it. I
wish I'd realized it more.

1776
01:16:59.519 --> 01:17:00.891
Whatever happened with the show?

1777
01:17:00.891 --> 01:17:03.485
Well. uh. you know. G4 is coming back.

1778
01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:04.562
That'll be funny.

1779
01:17:05.395 --> 01:17:07.063
No. It is coming back.

1780
01:17:07.063 --> 01:17:11.452
Like today. it relaunches.
Um. do we need lawyers?

1781
01:17:11.452 --> 01:17:13.463
There's one
big announcement that gamers

1782
01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:16.366
have been asking for. because
we've been stringing them

1783
01:17:16.366 --> 01:17:17.798
along for freaking ever.

1784
01:17:19.485 --> 01:17:20.902
The launch of G4.

1785
01:17:21.899 --> 01:17:24.746
That's right. November 16th. 2021.

1786
01:17:24.746 --> 01:17:28.127

I think we can
be proud of the time we spent

1792
01:18:01.157 --> 01:18:03.544
making "Attack of the Show".
For years. being a nerd

1793
01:18:03.544 --> 01:18:07.068
wasn't cool. Now geek
culture is the mainstream.

1794
01:18:07.068 --> 01:18:09.847
Fans are the ones covering
movies. comics. video games.

1795
01:18:09.847 --> 01:18:12.780
and more. And the only
qualification is an ability

1796
01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:16.058
to be honest and authentic
when it comes to your passion.

1797
01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:19.469
YouTubers and streamers. they
took over and now the world

1798
01:18:19.469 --> 01:18:22.855
hosts its own show. Even
if it is a world without

'Nuff said.

1849
01:25:55.137 --> 01:25:55.970
Excelsior!

1850
01:26:13.414 --> 01:26:16.288
Welcome back. Film expert. Chris Gore.

1851
01:26:17.433 --> 01:26:19.076
What is up first. Chris?

1852
01:26:19.076 --> 01:26:20.090
Well. sorry to say. this is

1853
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:22.592
the last edition of "DVDuesday"
I'm ever going to do.

1854
01:26:22.592 --> 01:26:24.933
I mean. does anyone even buy DVDs anymore?

1855
01:26:24.933 --> 01:26:25.890
Actually. you know what?

1856
01:26:25.890 --> 01:26:28.512
I buy DVDs and we're
reviewing today the movie

1857
01:26:28.512 --> 01:26:30.942
that you actually just
saw. "Attack of the Doc".

1858
01:26:30.942 --> 01:26:33.149
Now hopefully you bought this legally.

1859
01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:35.015
You didn't download it from
one of those sites. I mean.

1860
01:26:35.015 --> 01:26:36.657
look. would you steal a car?

1861
01:26:36.657 --> 01:26:38.058
No. absolutely not.

1862
01:26:38.058 --> 01:26:40.708
But I'm gonna admit I'm a little biased.

1863
01:26:40.708 --> 01:26:42.091
because I made the movie.

1864
01:26:42.091 --> 01:26:44.092
Now. could I have done a better job?

1865
01:26:44.092 --> 01:26:46.602
Absolutely. I could have
done a much better job.

1866
01:26:46.602 --> 01:26:50.024
But for what it is. I think
"Attack of the Doc" is a buy.

1867
01:26:52.226 --> 01:26:53.059
Bye!
