00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.520
Hello. Simon.

168
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.200
<i>Oh. there's all that to come.</i>

169
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.400
bags and doors and Simon.

170
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.200
<i>But work only makes up
about 70% of your time.</i>

171
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.280
<i>that precious 30% that's all yours.
that's where the real magic happens.</i>

172
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.760
<i>Connection. commitment. socialising.</i>

173
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.880
<i>Those are the pillars
of the spiciest bit of life. adult life.</i>

174
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.360

177
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.560
Well. it completely depends on whether
she can still go part-time.

178
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.600
- Er. yeah.
- If she can--

179
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.440
- I'd love to see her.
- You must.

180
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.560
- Hey.
-  Here we go.

181
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.680
- Happy birthday! How are you?
- Hello. Yeah.

182
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.360
Oh. my goodness me.

183
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.160
So... do you want us
to shout "stag" at you today. Freddy?

184
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.640
I think just Fred
at the normal volume will be fine. Yeah.

185
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.600
Sorry. is it okay that I'm genuinely
really enjoying quietly looking around

186
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.360
at friends and thinking about
how much I like them?

187
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.080
- Yeah.
- Is that a good stag?

188
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.480
Perfect. I mean. lovely pub.
lovely. well-dressed boys.

189
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.440
Er. I think I know
everyone here except. erm...

190
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.760
- Who is your best man. is it Kieran?
- Er. Kieran. yeah.

191
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.480
Erm... Yeah. lovely lad. He. erm...
He got me through uni actually.

192
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.440
Mmm-hmm.

193
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.440
He's a bit worried
about getting the best man stuff right.

194
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.960
- but he's one--
- Right. form a perfect horseshoe now.

195
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.600
Come on. you reprobates.
Perfect horseshoe. now.

196
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.880
Make sure it's tight
so it traps the sound.

197
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.720
Right. Hello.
you [hesitating] fucking cocks.

198
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.680
Ooh.

199
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.240
Okay. I want all ears focused exclusively
on my ass... listening to me. okay? Right.

200
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.720
First red card.
If I see a single one of you

201
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.600
without a drop of booze
in your hand throughout the day.

202
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.240
you're seeing off a Guinness.
and that's the end of the fucking story.

203
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.880
- okay?

204
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.520
Kiero...

205
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.920
Erm...

206
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.640
For those of you who haven't met him yet.
this is my best man. Kieran...

207
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.880
Hodgedale.

208
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.160
Kieran Hodgedale.
thank you for arranging this.

209
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.080
- Yes.
- Right.

210
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.520
Thank you. Fred. you fucking cock.

211
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.360
Oh. Hey.

212
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.600
That's the last time you'll thank me.
trust me.

213
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.240
This is gonna be the worst day
of this little dickhead's whole life.

214
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.640
Why?

215
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.640
Hmm.

216
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.240
Er. maybe because what I have planned
is complete carnage. Come on. man.

217
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.640
And speaking of men.
let me remind you. that. yes. we are men.

218
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.160
and if I catch a single one of you
not thinking about women's breasts

219
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.000
throughout the day. at any point.

220
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.760
if I spot that. you're seeing off
a Guinness straight away.

221
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.720
There'll be no pause. It'll be
in your mouth and down your gullet.

222
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.520
I don't fucking care.

223
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.080
Are you all right? Is everything okay?

224
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.800
Yeah. You all right? How's your buttons?

225
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.920
- Watch out.
-  Just please let me.

226
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.040
- What are you doing?
- Give me one second.

227
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.840
Did you see that?

228
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.840
He was going for a three-buttoned thing.
and I undid the top one.

229
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.120
All right. Good stuff.

230
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.120
- It looks good undone.
- Really?

231
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.520
- I'll keep it then.
- Yeah.

232
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.680
It's not stag
to compliment your mate's clothes.

233
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.720
If something feels like the quality
of a stag. don't shut it down.

234
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.880
- just let it breathe.
- Okay. that's cool.

235
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.120
Just. let's calm it down a little bit.

236
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.080
Ooh! Classic Fred. "I don't want someone
screaming at my mates on my stag do."

237
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.680
"I want to have a nice time."

238
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.960
- Well. no. I'm not saying that.
- But why are you not saying that?

239
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.680
Come on. Kieran. why don't you tell
everyone what you've got planned today.

240
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.640
- for the big day.
-  Fuck off!

241
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.560
- What is he doing?
- What is this?

242
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.320
- Mate.
- What do you want?

243
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.960
I haven't heard a single one of them
at any point through all of this going...

244
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.280
That was
the whole point of the speech!

245
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.560
What's happening?
Fred. what's happening to him?

246
00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.400
Is he like... Is he drunk or something?

247
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.920
Er. no. he doesn't drink.

248
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.280
Erm... Just talk amongst yourselves.

249
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.520
Hey. you okay. man?

250
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.320
Erm... Ahem. I was just thinking. you know.

251
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.040
everyone here thinks
you are absolutely brilliant.

252
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.920
Fuck off. you bastard.

253
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.520
I'm just ripping shit up
and chilling for a minute.

254
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:27.200
- Your mates are dickheads.
- Hey. come on. you prick.

255
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.240
Come and tell them
what plans you've got for the day. eh?

256
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.360
- Why weren't you swearing over there?
- I can swear if you want.

257
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.960
Please. can everyone swear a bit more?

258
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.760
Right. this prick is gonna tell us. erm.
what the plans are for the day.

259
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.320
so let's hear him out. shall we?

260
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.120
- Yeah. guys?
- Okay.

261
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

262
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.680
Okay. right.
So. first up. I hope you all like pork

263
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.520
because we're gonna be kicking off the day
by all having a lovely pork pie. yeah?

264
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.720
Sounds nice. yeah?
Well. it's not gonna be. 'cause. oh. dear.

265
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.080
whoever picks out the smallest pork pie
is seeing off a Guinness.

266
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.200
and then they have
to shit themselves in their trousers.

267
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.920
What?

268
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.560
"Have to... have to shit themselves"?

269
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.840
Cool. and then...
and then what's after that?

270
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.240
Your reaction's
so horrible. man!

271
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.800
No. we love it. don't we?
Yeah. Everyone's up for it. yeah.

272
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.200
In fact. guys. shall we get the pies?

273
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.840
- Yeah.
- Yeah? All right.

274
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.680
- Let's do the pies first?
-  Okay.

275
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.320
I'm gonna stand with a bag.

276
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.120
- and you take...
- Okay. guys. take out a pork pie each.

277
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.960
and whoever's got the smallest pie
at the end has to...

278
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.400
- Yeah... has to do a poo.
- Yeah. and then see off a Guinness.

279
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.120
- And then see off a Guinness.
- All right.

280
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.280
Here's mine.

281
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.520
Oh. God. I'm so sorry. Kieran.

282
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.240
About what?

283
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.760
I love this stuff!

284
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.320
Right. I'm gonna lay one down.

285
00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.440
- Now? You're gonna do it now?
- Can I grip your shoulder?

286
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.640
-  Yeah.
- Nah. man.

287
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.760
Make sure your friends look.

288
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.680
I feel like they're just turning away.

289
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.360
Erm. guys. watch this if you can.

290
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.560
- Fred?
-  He's almost done.

291
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.040
- Yeah.
- Done?

292
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.480
Small bit. You nutters.

293
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.760
- Give him a Guinness and then--
- Yep.

294
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.880
- Yeah. can someone cheer or something?
- Yes!

295
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.760
-  Well done.
- Thank you.

296
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.520
- Really well done.
- So. part two.

297
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.000
This is my first ever Guinness.

298
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.960
Yay. Cheers. everyone.

299
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.920
I can't believe what that tastes like.

300
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.360
Have you had one of these?

301
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.120
Yeah. I expected it to be
a lot sweeter. like butterscotch.

302
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.280
<i>Our coverage

{\an8}We can't see it from out here.

310
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.000
{\an8}It's happening. The couple are both 31.
and it's all completely brilliant.

312
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.920
{\an8}I've been talking to this upbeat family
about just how wonderful it all is.

313

{\an8}Bav Davison. just how wonderful is it?

314
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.920
{\an8}Well. I've got to say. I was just saying
this as well to my family and nieces.

{\an8}It's been a wonderful day.
The atmosphere is absolutely brilliant.

And well said.

319
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.840
{\an8}This is it. There's no other way
to say it. We're having such a top time.

320
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.360
{\an8}And what is it you think will be
particularly special about this marriage?

321
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.160
{\an8}Oh... They've just got everything.
They're such an exceptional couple.

322
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.520
{\an8}And I can't wait
to get a closer look at them

323
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.200
{\an8}and then to say
some very positive stuff about them.

324
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.840
{\an8}Yeah? What stuff will you say?

325
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.240
{\an8}Erm. I might say. oh. you know. their eyes
lit up the sky. something like that.

326
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.040
{\an8}Ha! I think we're all looking forward
to hearing her say that.

327
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.280
{\an8}Er. I said earlier that people
were coming down in their droves.

328
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.120
{\an8}- Have they. really?
- Yes.

329
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.440
{\an8}Yeah. I think it's understandable.
Because for me. it's such an amazing day

330
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.280
{\an8}that I would come down in my droves
if it meant being a part of the day.

331
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.040
{\an8}That's amazing. Enjoy your day. Let's have
a lick of ice cream and I'll be on my way.

332
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.800
{\an8}Mmm!

333
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.720
{\an8}All right.

334
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.760
{\an8}Can I ask. is all this just for a wedding?

335
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.600
{\an8}- What's everyone celebrating?
- Shut up.

336
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.120
{\an8}Shut up! Don't ask horrid questions.
you awful girl! Off!

337
00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.600
{\an8}Mmm.

338
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.520
{\an8}Oh! Bit of cardio to work off that cream.

339
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.680
{\an8}Right. where are we? Peter Ring here...
Erm. hello. You got down here quickly.

340
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.120
{\an8}Oh. No. I'm a different person.
But it has been an exquisite day

341
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.120
{\an8}and the atmosphere here is wonderful.

342
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.280
{\an8}- Amazing. isn't it?
- Yeah. it is amazing.

343
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.240
{\an8}I should know. because I got married
last week. and my wedding wasn't amazing.

344
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.560
{\an8}- Really. was it not?
- It was nothing.

345
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.440
{\an8}It didn't bring all the country together.
It didn't feel pleasant or brilliant.

346
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.600
{\an8}No one came in their droves.
It was nothing.

347
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.160
{\an8}- Nothing at all?
- Nothing.

348
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.080
{\an8}Nothing whatsoever. And that kind of
sums up the feeling here today.

349
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.320
{\an8}A feeling of elation. A feeling
of reverence and a sense of community.

350
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.000
{\an8}And a sense that until today.
literally nothing of worth has happened.

351
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.280
{\an8}I'm getting word.

352
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.840
{\an8}They both said "I do." It's happening.
They got married! They've done it!

353
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.360
{\an8}They'll be together forever!

354
00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.920
{\an8}- Let's get in there.

355
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.200
- Let's get in among you all.

356
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.560
- We love it!

357
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.640
{\an8}Look at this guy!

358
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.200
{\an8}This is history!

359
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.880
{\an8}This is marriage! This is wonderful!

360
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.200
{\an8}It's only right...

361
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.760
{\an8}He's done the best thing he'll ever do!

362
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.800
{\an8}Let's kill him!
He's got nothing more to give.

363
00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.480
{\an8}Give me that!

364
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.000
{\an8}Don't hog that cream!

365
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.080
{\an8}Mmm!

366
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.240
- It's all wonderful.

367
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.280
{\an8}I love it!

368
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.320
{\an8}With everybody in the world looking.

369
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.040
{\an8}This is marriage! This is commitment!

370
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.840
It ain't gonna be... I mean. look at them.

371
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.400
Hey. guys. Don't be too damn awesome.

372
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.240
You'll make me want to quit my job
and play with you full-time!

373
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.960
Bit of fun.

374
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.360
Am I just loved up. or does it seem
like our kids are actually funny?

375
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.960
Not just 'cause they're ours.

376
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.000
Yeah. They're. like. actually funny.

377
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.600
Yeah. they're so funny.

378
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.640
You guys have such lovely rapport
with them. It's amazing.

379
00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.960
- We're still working on it with our Nick.
-  Oh. Yeah.

380
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.040
No. I get on with Nick. I'm a good dad.

381
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.080
No offence. Geoff. but I think it's fair
to say these two are on another level.

382
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.240
-  That's so sweet.
-  No competition.

383
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.240
We all have our own journey with it.

384
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.880
I'm always happy to talk
to little Nick if he's struggling.

385
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.720
Aaron and Nick actually have
a pretty great thing going.

386
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.360
Have you noticed that?
Best buds.

387
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.120
- Just this little cowboy voice.

388
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.320
-  I don't know.
- Geoff. no.

389
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.800
Okay. here's one.
Parent Advice Zone. please.

390
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.080
Er. your son comes
into your room at 3:00 a.m.

391
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.840
saying he dreamed you were flying away
from him and he couldn't reach you.

392
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.440
- Mmm.
- How do you comfort him? Geoff?

393
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Er...

394
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.760
Er. I don't let him in my room.

395
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.840
I don't like spending time
with him after 4:00 p.m.

396
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.280
-  Aw!
- 3:00. 4:00.

397
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.960
That is such a shame.

398
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.160
We prefer to be very attached.
That's quite disconnected.

399
00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.480
-  Geoff. don't!
-  Hey!

400
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.080
Embarrassing.

401
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:07.800
When Bo doesn't come and wake me up
in my room. I go in his room and get him.

402
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.280
- Oh!
- Do you?

403
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.480
- I love to. Stop that. Geoff.
-  Bless...

404
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.680
Er... Oh.

405
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.520
- Chatter machine deactivate. the BBQ bits.
- Here he goes.

406
00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.640
I hope you like your veg
the wellest of done-shire.

407
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.760
"Wellest of done-shire." He's so funny.

408
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.800
How do they think of these things?

409
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.280
Please. Geoff.

410
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.520
If you strangle people.
you could really kill them.

411
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:31.920
All right. yeah.

412
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.120
Actually. look at that.
They're perfectly done!

413
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.560
- Any burgers and chips?
- What's that?

414
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:46.000
- Any burgers and chips?
- Oh! This is a flesh-free zone. actually.

415
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.240
We are peas. trees. and planty McGees.

416
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.080
We want the kids to grow up
with a leafy conscience.

417
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.000
Yum!

418
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.920
I feed my kid a big nugget every night.

419
00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.360
- It's big.
-  The grub smells gorgeous.

420
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.080
- How do you get veg to smell so good?

421
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.600
Good Q. Well. like I say to my kids.

422
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.000
just intro Olly and Sally
to the courgette of honour.

423
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.640
And I'll let you do the honours.

424
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.480
Oh! Careful there. Geoff. Whoops!

425
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.760
Look. please do eat
as much as you can.

426
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.160
I'll be up all night
gobbling otherwise. Yeah...

427
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.560
I notice you keep trying to strangle me.

428
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.720
You keep doing that. Geoff.
your kids will think you're weird.

429
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.120
Bad dadding. mate.

430
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.360
Oh. deary me.

431
00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.720

Hey. Nick.

462
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.040
New series. new location in Cornwall.

463
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.640
new chicks. new lads.
and one hot new twist.

464
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.840
Your breath better not stink of shit.
'cause this is <i>Kiss Villa.</i>

465
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.800
Let's meet the boys and girls
looking for tongue time in the sunshine.

466
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:57.520
You all right? I'm Vin. I'm 20. I call
my abs sisters 'cause they keep me strong

467
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.920
and I tell 'em everything.

468
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.120
I'm J-Barb. I'm 39.
I'm trouble. I've got stubble.

469
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.360
and I love to kiss above all.

470
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.680
Hi. I'm Seb. I'm actually
the format creator of <i>Kiss Villa.</i>

471
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.400
I've been trying to get
on the show since I came up with it.

472
00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.320
Hi. I'm Hugo. I'm 6'1".

473
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.000
I'm 6'1".

474
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.480
<i>Best night of my life?</i>

475
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.360
This one evening. yeah. I kissed
a different girl every 15 seconds.

476
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.480
That was a special night that.

477
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.280
<i>Let's just say
I'm a kiss enthusiast.</i>

478
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.760
I just think
kissing is completely brilliant.

479
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.640
<i>Oh. God. my best feature?</i>

480
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.640
I'd probably have to say my gums. I had
serious problems with them growing up

481
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.040
'cause I ate too much brown sauce.
so I had to keep my kissing small.

482
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.720
<i>But I had 'em scraped pre-Villa. so yeah.</i>

483
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.640
Looking forward to much bigger kisses.

484
00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.920
Mwah!

485
00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.480
Four sets of laddie lips
in need of a kissy fix.

486
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.240
- Get down here.
-  Fucking hell.

Oh. Look at this pool. man!

493
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.080
Boys. it's great to have you.
and you're looking pucker.

494
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.680
- Not looking bad yourself.
-  Hey.

495
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.720
Speaking of pucker. here come
the girls you might want to kiss.

496
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.960
I'm Georgina. I'm 21. I used to be
a dancer. And these days. I'm a dancer.

497
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.720
I'm Ellin. I design funky coffins.

498
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.240
Erm. I had my tongue piercing removed
and the hole just kept getting wider.

499
00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.240
Are you all right
doing this. Checky?

500
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.360
Sorry. I'm incredibly. erm.
full and bunged up.

501
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:46.520
I'm Nafaf. short for Natalie Fafani.
And my last kiss was. well. let's just say

502
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.640
around a certain Brexit referendum.

503
00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.720
So. yeah. 20... 2016.

504
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.320
I always say
it's not the kiss that matters.

505
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.240
It's how nice the kiss is
with the guy you're kissing.

506
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.640
I've been single for three months now.

507
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.480
Yeah. I'm a young mum with a kooky tongue
looking to get a tongue through my tongue.

508
00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.360
Oh. yeah.

509
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.160

Okay. now we've all had
a good lookie at each other's lippies.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.560
I'd like you all

523
00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.840
to join me at the barrel.

524
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.120
- Already? We just got here.
-  That's a little serious.

525
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.920
I'm up for whatever. man.

526
00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.040
As much as I wish I'd gathered you
round this bazza for a laugh.

527
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.200
that's not the case.

528

Right. You've got
until I can smash through this B

551
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.800

Off you go.

553
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.800
Okay. quick. over to the nook.

Let's go.

555
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.880
- Right. boys. come on. let's go.
-  Let's get to that nook.

556
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.000
-  Right.
-  It is a really tough decision.

557
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.400
It's a toughie.

558
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.600
I'm gonna say
straight out the boozer. man.

559
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.160
I think it's me. I think it's me.
I've just got this feeling. man.

560
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.480
Do you know what I mean? I want
that carbonara. We gotta get this right.

561
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.520
- I also thought it was me. actually.
- Did you?

562
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.720
I just think that because
I'm a dancer and none of you are hot

563
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.720
- that it might be me. or...
- Right. yeah. no.

564
00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.280
I did think that.
Er. that it could be either of us.

565
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.120
You're safe. I mean. J-Barb. I think
you're a sick lad. but it's definitely me.

566
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.280
I think you're great. I think you're all
good lads. I don't want to be doing this.

567
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.760
But I feel like it's me.

568
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.080
- I thought it was like either me or you.
- Well. or me.

569
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.800
- But. like. me.
- Or me.

570
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.600
It's definitely not you.

571
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.040
You have the same thing? That's mad.
And you? You think it's you?

572
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.600
- I think it's me.

573
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.040
- How old are you?
- 57.

574
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.160
Know what I mean?

575
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.560
Right. you horrid lot.

577
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.160
Sorry. Should we stand
in the same formation?

578
00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.200
This is not what I wanna be doing.

579
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.640
Now.

580
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.160

Because I've gotta be up at 10:00 a.m.

656
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.760
Dear God. Yeah. Well. please.

657
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.760
It's fine.

658
00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.280
Yeah. Go. go. go.

659
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.440
Alexa. what's the time?

660
00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.040
<i>The time is 6:45.</i>

661
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.440
Is it?

662
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.520
Did you see that photo
of me and Helen in Rome eating pizza?

663
00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.440
- Can I have a look at that?

664
00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.000
In a second. Grandad. Andy. you haven't
commented on that pic of me.

665
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.760
Can I see that pic?

666
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.760
How do I. er... say a comment about--

667
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.840
Oh. my God. We... we should set up
a thread just for family photos.

668
00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.120
I'd love to have... a thread... please.

669
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.720
- We're going. Love you. Happy birthday.
- Thanks...

670
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.040
Thanks for the computer.
and remember to include me in things.

671
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.400
<i>But since then. he started
a small potted plant business.</i>

672
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.840
<i>This year will be his first
Chelsea Flower Show.</i>

673
00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.160
<i>and he'll be exhibiting
alongside his wife.</i>

674
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.720
<i>Elderly people find it
seriously bloody hard to use tech.</i>

675
00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.400
<i>I can't do it.</i>

676
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.760
<i>I can help you do it.</i>

677
00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.800
I cannot stand Google.

678
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.120
No. Google is amazing. man.

679
00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.520
The tip of my finger keeps getting bigger.

680
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.840
I think I must be allergic to my dog.

681
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.120
That is not to do with tech.

682
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.120
Hi. I'm Anthony Clance.
and I'm a thoroughly nice chap.

683
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.800
And I'll come around
and we'll have a couple of black coffees.

684
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:19.080
And we'll have you tackling
extremely difficult tech at your pace.

685
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.400
<i>Easing You In with Anthony Clance.</i>

686
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.640
<i>So. what do you think?</i>

687
00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.960
<i>What do you think?</i>

688
00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.800
<i>Hello?</i>

689
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.480
- One second. David.
-  <i>That's all right.</i>

690
00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.560
Hello. Terry Gill speaking.

691
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.560
<i>You're just looking at me.
Okay? Have I got a cute cat on my face?</i>

692
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.960
<i>Do you want me to help you with tech?
I can ease you in.</i>

693
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.400
I beg your pardon?

694
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.160
Never beg. Terry.

695
00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.320
It puts a "B" among the egg.

696
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.400
Now. tell me. Terry.
how can I help you with the tech?

697
00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.200
Er. can we do this some other time?

698
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.920
Oh. come on. Gill. T-Gill.

699
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.000
We've both got a couple of black coffees.

700
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.760
Why are you so manic
and stubborn about the tech?

701
00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.640
Become more chilled out.

702
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.120
And before you know it.
you'll be doing an upward thumb.

703
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.120
Okay.

704
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.160
How much are your services?

705
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.760
Don't be so wild. T-Gill.

706
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.240
It's free. We both need this.

707
00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.960
You want to be an IT whiz.

708
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.280
and I want to live in a world
where no person is slowing things down.

709
00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.000
Now. tell me.
what tech can I help you with the tech?

710
00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.760
Er...

711
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.800
I wasn't sure how to get on the thread.

712
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.480
And to look at photos
and talk to my family.

713
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.440
Texts.

714
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.840
- Yeah. but also photos--
- It's all texts!

715
00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:16.120
I came all the way down from Glasgow
to teach you about the majesty of tech.

716
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.040
And you want me to show you texts?

717
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.200
Oh.

718
00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.000
Do you not know how to do them?

719
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.280
Do I know how to do texts?

720
00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.240
Are you shaking my piss?

721
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.080
I'm doing texts in my slumber. Terry G.

722
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:36.680
I'm not here to text.
GIF. or little smiling face.

723
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.640
No. tell me why
you really brought me here.

724
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.440
I didn't know I had.

725
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.040
Well then. I consider you
to be dumb to me.

726
00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:54.520
I consider you to be dumb for me. Terry.
asking me easy questions like this.

727
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.560
I consider you to be dumb to me.

728
00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.280
Show me.

729
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.680
Show me what you can do with the tech.

730
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.520
Er... Well. er... Er. er...

731
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.840
I know how to turn it on.

732
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.360
- Er...

733
00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:18.720
Oh. you're making your laptop into gunk.

734
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.800
Terry doesn't get tech.

735
00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.080
Gilly.

736
00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.520
Gilly.

737
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.680
What are you doing. Gilly? Calm down.

738
00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.080
Leave me be. I just want to see.

739
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.360
See what? The texts?

740
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.520
And pictures. Don't shout at me.

741
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.440
I'm not a part of it. but I need to be.

742
00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:44.560
I wanted to comment
on the thread.

743
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.480
I'm bored.

744
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.120
I'm so bored.

745
00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.080
I'm lonely and I'm bored.

746
00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.800
Tez man. Gilly T.

747
00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.720
I think I'm starting to get you. G.

748
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.360
Do you know how lucky you are to be bored?

749
00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.800
You're free from distraction.

750
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.680
And I love you for that. Terry.

751
00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.280
But... but I need it!

752
00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.840
I just told you. Terry man.
you don't need it!

753
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.080
Do you want to be like them?
Scrambled egg?

754
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.280
Okay. fine. I will show it to you.
you silliness.

755
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.760
See? It's nothing. Cat shit.

756
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.480
Here is Luton Larry.
and what is he even doing big style?

757
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.760
You don't need this tech.
and you don't need me.

758
00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.360
- Just do nothing. Tez man G.

759
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.680
Nothing is better than Luton Larry.

760
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.240
Now.

761
00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.080
you're gonna wake up in a minute. Terry.

762
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.600
And when you do. I want you to promise me

763
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.640
you're going to do something
that makes you happy.

764
00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.040
Thank you.

765
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.080
<i>But since then
he's started a small...</i>

766
00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.680
Ah.

767
00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.880
Hi. are you all right?
Clive. yeah? Dr Jack. yeah?

768
00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.000
So. for me. Clive. you are looking well.

769
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.120
Yeah? One of the boys.
Is that a new drip?

770
00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.520
Yes.

771
00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.320
Yeah. mate. Looks fire.

772
00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.960
Look. basically. I wanted
to pull you for a chat today

773
00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.160
just to chat about your results
and be a bit caring towards you. really.

774
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.680
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah. So. for me. it's got quite bad.

775
00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.480
Yeah. And for me. you've got
this quite rare blood thing. To me.

776
00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.080
Hmm. Okay.

777
00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.200
So. where my head's at.
in terms of the truth.

778
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.520
is you've got sort of between two minutes

779
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.240
and two minutes.
15 seconds before you're dead.

780
00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.400
- Okay. thank you.
- That's all right. don't worry.

781
00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.320
Zack here. he's going to sort
your body out when you go. yeah?

782
00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.920
And you can
say your last words to him. all right?

783
00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.600
Er. is there anything else
I can get for you. fella?

784
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.760
Please say no.

785
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.760
No.
