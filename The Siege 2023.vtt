3
00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:36.797
So. what did he do?

4
00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.000
It's what he's gonna do.

5
00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.605
Fuck's sake. Davids!
Eyes on the road.

6
00:01:56.284 --> 00:01:57.285
Davids!

7
00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:08.256
Go and check on them.

8
00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:09.823
Get with the fucking program.

9
00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.287
Stay with the informant.

10
00:05:23.357 --> 00:05:24.658
Oh. thanks. man.

11
00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.126
Did Mike send you?

12
00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:27.495
Oh. fuck. man.

13
00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:29.530
Did you kill them all?

14
00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.579
Wait. wait.

15
00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:46.980
Who sent you?

16
00:05:48.416 --> 00:05:49.650
Please. man.

17
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.919
I'll give you
whatever you want.

18
00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.221
You have nothing I want.

19
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:55.823
I have kids.

20
00:05:55.823 --> 00:05:58.392
Please. There's money.

21
00:05:58.392 --> 00:05:59.760
Loads of it.

22
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.996
You can get out
of the game like me. man.

23
00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:06.600
Why would I want that?

24
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.868
Who are you?

25
00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:12.440
I'm nobody.

26
00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:40.200
Fuck.

27
00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:07.795
Speak.

28
00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:09.930
I've lost a witness.

29
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.364
He saw my face.

30
00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:15.603
I've been made.

31
00:07:15.603 --> 00:07:16.970
Share your location.

32
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.508
We'll send a car.
Time for you to disappear again.

33
00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:52.826
Ah. you like to keep
the night shift busy. don't you?

34
00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:54.227
Because
you're always here.

35
00:09:54.227 --> 00:09:56.096
I heard you were back.

36
00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.597
Always a pleasure. Forge.

37
00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:58.799
You've been here
so many times.

38
00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:02.836
it's easy to fast-track
a new identity for you.

39
00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:06.173
I'll get your new documents
turned over.

40
00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:08.776
Tonight.

41
00:10:10.978 --> 00:10:12.045
Please.

42
00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:15.749
You're not
the only resident tonight.

43
00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:17.818
Some particularly
nefarious types

44
00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:20.988
who won't take kindly
to queue jumpers.

45
00:10:20.988 --> 00:10:22.455
I'll see what I can do.

46
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.490
Thank you.

47
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.625
Good night. Walker.

48
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.827
Smithee.

49
00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:27.828
Good night.

50
00:10:27.828 --> 00:10:29.329
Get him processed
before lockdown.

51
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:31.832
Right.
Personals are next.

52
00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:32.866
Follow me.

53
00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:34.835
- Hey.
- Oh.

54
00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:35.936
Just the man I need.

55
00:10:35.936 --> 00:10:37.470
Me?
You--you--you need me?

56
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.306
Uh. I mean yes.
I--I can help.

57
00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:41.308
What--what--
what do you need?

58
00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:43.276
Uh. just the keys
to the upstairs office.

59
00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:45.478
Oh. uh...
o--o--of course.

60
00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.314
Um... when--

61
00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:49.750
when the renovation is done
and it's all electronic. you--

62
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.084
you won't need me as much.

63
00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:52.352
Not the keys at least.

64
00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:55.756
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

65
00:10:57.024 --> 00:10:59.059
Um. what is it?
It's not this one.

66
00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.660
Ah.

67
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.331
Sorry. it's a bit stiff.

68
00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:06.233
Here. This one.

69
00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:07.234
Yes.

70
00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:11.004
Perfect. Thanks.

71
00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.039
Thanks.

72
00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:14.541
Perfect...

73
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.278
what?

74
00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:19.479
Come on.

75
00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:20.781
All right.

76
00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:21.749
Locking down

77
00:11:21.749 --> 00:11:23.583
will commence in 15 minutes.

78
00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:25.285
A word of advice.

79
00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:26.987
For me?
What--what for?

80
00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:29.056
When a girl
opens a door for you.

81
00:11:29.056 --> 00:11:32.525
do everyone a favor
and walk through it.

82
00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:34.828
- Smithee.
- Smithee.

83
00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:37.497
Doesn't that get confusing?

84
00:11:37.497 --> 00:11:38.766
Coming from someone
who has a new name

85
00:11:38.766 --> 00:11:40.868
nearly every week.

86
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.170
Fair.

87
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.038
Just watch your step.
huh. Mr. Walker.

88
00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.343
Ah. right.

89
00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:52.980
No attempting to contact anyone
outside the facility.

90
00:11:54.782 --> 00:11:55.983
You know about
the signal jammer?

91
00:11:55.983 --> 00:11:57.650
Yes.

92
00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.952
Dietary require--

93
00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:06.426
So. I guess that's not relevant
to you. is it?

94
00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:09.229
Hm. No?

95
00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:12.632
Okay.

96
00:12:16.804 --> 00:12:17.805
That it?

97
00:12:27.447 --> 00:12:30.050
As always.
you'll be locked in overnight.

98
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.319
It's still the best way to keep
everyone minding their business

99
00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:34.654
during the night shift's
minimal security.

100
00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:38.291
At least until we upgrade.

101
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.728
The case. sir.

102
00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:42.729
This stays with me.

103
00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:44.264
I don't think
you understand. sir.

104
00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.833
Nothing stays with you.

105
00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.100
I don't think
you understand.

106
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.969
ya fucking tea leaf
little prick.

107
00:12:48.969 --> 00:12:50.303
This case stays with me.

108
00:12:50.303 --> 00:12:51.604
Right. fingerprints.

109
00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:52.806
Am I going to
have to call security. sir?

110
00:12:54.007 --> 00:12:55.809
Why the fuck
you calling me sir?

111
00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:57.477
Chop-chop. Mr. Walker.

112
00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:06.419
I assure you.
it's for the system to work.

113
00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:09.442
You get your ass...

114
00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:11.111
Sir. I--

115
00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:41.608
On schedule. I see.
Keep this up

116
00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:43.343
and I'll start
believing I can rely on you.

117
00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:45.278
Yes. sir.

118
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.248
The place is about to lock down.

119
00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:50.317
Security is as easy
as we thought.

120
00:15:50.317 --> 00:15:51.318
Now. that's the problem

121
00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:53.820
when goodwill
is your main security protocol.

122
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.489
It tends to expire.
Especially mine.

123
00:15:56.489 --> 00:15:58.825
I've sent you the target.
Make this neat.

124
00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:01.928
Make this tidy.
No witnesses.

125
00:16:01.928 --> 00:16:06.299
I want her breathing.
Otherwise. you won't be.

126
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.178
Get Keates.

127
00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:21.181
Wait.

128
00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:25.485
And the details of every single
fucker inside these walls.

129
00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:26.519
No one survives.

130
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.160
This is gonna be fun.

131
00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:51.278
What's she look like?

132
00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:55.615
Not your type.

133
00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.487
Yours?

134
00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:08.161
Either way. she's dead.

135
00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:09.362
Alive. Keates.

136
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:15.368
All right. guys.
let's draw some blood.

137
00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:51.298
Locking doors for lockdown.

138
00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:01.308
- Ah! Oh. ah.

139
00:19:01.308 --> 00:19:03.643
- Sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Don't do that.

140
00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:04.911
- I--I--I just. um...
- Oh. gosh.

141
00:19:04.911 --> 00:19:08.781
You almost gave me
a heart... attack...

142
00:19:08.781 --> 00:19:09.949
- In fact...
- Oh. God.

143
00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:11.918
Oh. God. Um...

144
00:19:11.918 --> 00:19:16.323
Oh. your face is priceless.

145
00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:18.925
Just--just--
just wanted to say bye.

146
00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:21.127
S--s--sorry.
Bye-bye then.

147
00:19:21.127 --> 00:19:24.297
I got the new
Freedom Alliance box set.

148
00:19:24.297 --> 00:19:25.665
all six seasons.

149
00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:28.067
Maybe you could come and
watch them with me next week--

150
00:19:28.067 --> 00:19:32.104
if you want to watch them.
I mean.

151
00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:33.773
- Is that the door?
- Huh?

152
00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:36.809
Hm? I mean.
uh. y--y--yes.

153
00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:38.911
That... that would be lovely.

154
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:40.146
Great.

155
00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:44.050
Um. so I got these with
the Freedom Alliance box set.

156
00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.552
I--I don't know
if you want them.

157
00:19:45.552 --> 00:19:47.119
Freedom Alliance pens.

158
00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:49.088
These... these were
limited edition.

159
00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:50.890
I...I saw you. you know.

160
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.425
looking on the internet
and stuff for them

161
00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:55.328
and I just figured
they'd end up in my drawers.

162
00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:58.598
So. I will see you next week.

163
00:19:58.598 --> 00:19:59.766
Not if I see you first.
But that--

164
00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:00.767
but I do--I--

165
00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:03.336
I do want to see you
first--last--sorry.

166
00:20:03.336 --> 00:20:05.772
- Six seasons. remember?
- To the future.

167
00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:42.609

Please
immediately.

184
00:24:16.656 --> 00:24:18.591
Security breach.

185
00:24:27.033 --> 00:24:28.267
We don't have much time.

186
00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:29.502
We need your help.

187
00:24:29.502 --> 00:24:30.503
Do I know you?

188
00:24:30.503 --> 00:24:32.905
No. but I know you.

189
00:24:32.905 --> 00:24:34.774
Get out of my room.

190
00:24:34.774 --> 00:24:36.976
- I'm--
- No personal details.

191
00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:39.679
We need your help.

192
00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:41.581
Lock the door
on the way out.

193
00:24:41.581 --> 00:24:42.915
The compound's been sieged.

194
00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:44.717
They want us dead.

195
00:24:44.717 --> 00:24:46.318
That sounds like
a "you" problem.

196
00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:48.588
Or you could just
wait to get shot.

197
00:24:52.458 --> 00:24:54.493
You're obviously
not who I thought you were.

198
00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:58.698
Sorry to disappoint.

199
00:25:00.199 --> 00:25:01.534
Juliet.

200
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:16.549
The key!

201
00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:55.087
Security breach.

202
00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:31.483
Do you know how to use that?

203
00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:35.121
Says the guy
who has a bullet in his arm.

204
00:27:36.522 --> 00:27:38.758
Touché.

205
00:27:41.928 --> 00:27:43.495
Do you want me
to come back later?

206
00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:44.997
- Wanna help now. do you?
- No.

207
00:27:44.997 --> 00:27:48.000
But you left my door open
and got me shot.

208
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.368
Serves you right.

209
00:27:50.369 --> 00:27:51.804
These guys have
firepower.

210
00:27:51.804 --> 00:27:53.005
We need more weapons.

211
00:27:53.005 --> 00:27:54.006
There's no we.

212
00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:55.174
And who the fuck
are these guys?

213
00:27:55.174 --> 00:27:56.843
And she's definitely
not supposed to be--

214
00:27:56.843 --> 00:27:58.677
"She" is stood
right here.

215
00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:00.446
Come on.

216
00:28:00.446 --> 00:28:01.447
Juliet.

217
00:28:01.447 --> 00:28:02.782
This one is on you.

218
00:28:02.782 --> 00:28:03.950
Get down there.

219
00:28:53.132 --> 00:28:54.366
I must stop
finding you like this.

220
00:28:57.036 --> 00:28:58.270
I had it under control.

221
00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.305
Yeah. Clearly.

222
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:06.779
What you looking at?

223
00:29:13.953 --> 00:29:14.921
We need to move.

224
00:29:14.921 --> 00:29:16.322
We've got to get
to the weapons lockup

225
00:29:16.322 --> 00:29:17.824
if we're going to
weather this storm.

226
00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.128
You're bleeding.

227
00:29:22.128 --> 00:29:23.595
I'm fine. Take this.

228
00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.297
Let's go.

229
00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:28.400
- Are you coming?
- We can't trust him.

230
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.601
You came to me.

231
00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:31.337
When someone shows me
who they are. I believe them.

232
00:29:31.337 --> 00:29:32.738
- We need him.
- He doesn't need you.

233
00:29:32.738 --> 00:29:34.773
- I'm afraid.
- Prick.

234
00:31:27.186 --> 00:31:29.321
Hey. any eyes
on the little one?

235
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:30.589
Nope.

236
00:31:30.589 --> 00:31:31.890
You got a light?

237
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.925
Sure.

238
00:31:36.963 --> 00:31:38.397
So. you seen
her picture?

239
00:31:38.397 --> 00:31:39.531
No. have you?

240
00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:43.002
Let's put it this way.

241
00:31:43.002 --> 00:31:45.737
If it's me against [indistinct].
she won't be walking for a week.

242
00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:46.772
You're sick.

243
00:31:51.043 --> 00:31:52.844
Oy. we only had
a couple of puffs.

244
00:31:52.844 --> 00:31:54.380
Don't waste it.

245
00:32:04.023 --> 00:32:06.192
[echoes] Dad.

246
00:32:16.502 --> 00:32:17.503
Oy.

247
00:32:18.537 --> 00:32:20.472
That was easy.

248
00:32:20.472 --> 00:32:22.274
Come on. princess.

249
00:32:32.018 --> 00:32:33.452
I was trying to
keep this quiet but--

250
00:32:33.452 --> 00:32:34.520
You're welcome.

251
00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:36.989
You okay?

252
00:32:36.989 --> 00:32:38.057
Yeah.

253
00:32:38.057 --> 00:32:39.358
Let's go.

254
00:32:50.202 --> 00:32:52.838
To the weapons.

255
00:32:52.838 --> 00:32:55.407
I need guns. phasers.
Set phasers.

256
00:32:55.407 --> 00:32:57.743
I have three phasers.
limited edition.

257
00:32:57.743 --> 00:33:00.779
original boxes.
Just pull yourself together.

258
00:33:00.779 --> 00:33:02.081
I need to get to the weapons.

259
00:33:02.081 --> 00:33:04.450
Don't die. Live long--

260
00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:08.154
Okay. No guns.

261
00:33:08.154 --> 00:33:10.589
No guns. No guns.

262
00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:31.443
How did you know
it was there?

263
00:33:31.443 --> 00:33:33.845
It's where
I would put it.

264
00:33:36.115 --> 00:33:37.516
Argh.

265
00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.625
What are you looking for?

266
00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:49.195
Keys to the gun closet.

267
00:34:03.942 --> 00:34:06.011
Just the man we need.

268
00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:09.047
Gosh. I'd hate to be
the man you didn't need.

269
00:34:12.651 --> 00:34:13.652
What's that
doing on the floor?

270
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.422
What's that doing on the floor?

271
00:34:16.422 --> 00:34:19.591
We need the keys
to the gun closet.

272
00:34:19.591 --> 00:34:20.792
The guns. Smithee.

273
00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:21.927
What guns?

274
00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:24.263
Oh. those guns.

275
00:34:24.263 --> 00:34:26.632
Oh. no. not on me.
Not that one.

276
00:34:26.632 --> 00:34:28.834
I know we look ramshackle
at the moment.

277
00:34:28.834 --> 00:34:31.002
but some things have to remain
pretty secure.

278
00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:33.405
firearms being priority. but...

279
00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:34.773
But what?

280
00:34:34.773 --> 00:34:37.643
Have you checked the
in-tray of unprocessed items?

281
00:34:37.643 --> 00:34:38.844
The in-tray?

282
00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:51.790
The in-tray.

283
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:52.824
No guns. but...

284
00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.794
Yes.
It's very nice.

285
00:34:57.763 --> 00:34:58.964
What are these?

286
00:34:58.964 --> 00:35:00.399
Smoke grenades.

287
00:35:00.399 --> 00:35:02.734
Save your pocket
for something more useful.

288
00:35:02.734 --> 00:35:04.970
I don't know.
I think it might come in handy.

289
00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:10.409
Be careful with that.

290
00:35:10.409 --> 00:35:11.443
I'm not quite sure
why it was checked in.

291
00:35:13.645 --> 00:35:14.780
Oh. that's what it does.

292
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:15.847
Give it to me.

293
00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:17.048
Very MI6.

294
00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:21.187
The weapons lockout.
it's down here.

295
00:35:23.822 --> 00:35:25.424
Juliet. get ready
with that smoke.

296
00:35:47.546 --> 00:35:50.516
Juliet. smoke!

297
00:37:05.691 --> 00:37:06.925
Gosh.

298
00:37:08.594 --> 00:37:09.795
Ha! Ugh!

299
00:37:18.604 --> 00:37:20.839
I'm--I'm not gonna die?

300
00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:22.441
No.
You're gonna be fine.

301
00:37:23.442 --> 00:37:24.610
Thank you.

302
00:37:26.878 --> 00:37:28.213
Ugh.

303
00:37:30.449 --> 00:37:33.919
S--so sorry.

304
00:37:33.919 --> 00:37:35.186
It's okay.

305
00:37:57.275 --> 00:37:58.544
Fuck.

306
00:38:03.148 --> 00:38:05.050
We gotta get
that bullet out of you.

307
00:38:07.586 --> 00:38:09.321
I'll be fine.

308
00:38:10.322 --> 00:38:12.691
There has to be some
medical shit in the lab.

309
00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:32.110
Are you okay?

310
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:36.114
Yeah. Just hot.

311
00:38:36.114 --> 00:38:37.683
I'm fine. thanks.

312
00:38:42.354 --> 00:38:44.155
You've been knocked up.

313
00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:46.658
The cause of all this?

314
00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:47.926
You don't need to
know the details.

315
00:38:47.926 --> 00:38:49.828
I'm here
with a piece of crap in my leg

316
00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:51.997
because you two
is too incompetent

317
00:38:51.997 --> 00:38:53.331
to lock a fucking door.

318
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:55.000
Don't tell me
what I need to know.

319
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.167
Mention that one more time.

320
00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:57.268
Argh!

321
00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:59.304
I dare you.

322
00:39:02.207 --> 00:39:04.175
- I'm fine.
- The baby?

323
00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:05.977
Hopefully not.

324
00:39:08.647 --> 00:39:11.483
Argh!

325
00:39:17.923 --> 00:39:19.591
I'm waiting.

326
00:39:21.627 --> 00:39:23.762
Our work requires
we don't ask questions.

327
00:39:23.762 --> 00:39:24.763
Don't get attached.

328
00:39:24.763 --> 00:39:27.232
Something
you are totally incapable of.

329
00:39:27.232 --> 00:39:29.468
This time...
I couldn't walk away.

330
00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:33.304
Why?

331
00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:35.340
Let's just say
at some point.

332
00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.510
your past refuses to stay... past.

333
00:39:39.978 --> 00:39:43.014
I got involved
in a kidnapping...

334
00:39:43.014 --> 00:39:44.215
four women.

335
00:39:45.717 --> 00:39:47.218
Sex trafficking?

336
00:39:51.089 --> 00:39:52.791
Who was she sold to?

337
00:39:53.792 --> 00:39:54.993
There was a buyer.

338
00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:57.996
but the boss
took a liking to her.

339
00:39:57.996 --> 00:40:00.298
Even more so when he found out
about the baby.

340
00:40:00.298 --> 00:40:02.033
These rings are impenetrable.

341
00:40:03.268 --> 00:40:06.438
But when he decided
he wanted to keep her.

342
00:40:06.438 --> 00:40:09.508
it caused problems. delays.

343
00:40:09.508 --> 00:40:11.443
Delays which gave me opportunity.

344
00:40:11.443 --> 00:40:12.478
To steal her.

345
00:40:12.478 --> 00:40:13.812
Stealing
implies ownership.

346
00:40:13.812 --> 00:40:16.548
That's how
they all see it.

347
00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:28.293
This past of yours...?

348
00:40:30.496 --> 00:40:32.931
Hit a little close. did it?

349
00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:39.104
My life in this world...

350
00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:41.773
all started when
I was stolen as a child.

351
00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:47.813
in broad daylight.
from the streets of Naples.

352
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:52.083
I won't let those things
happen anymore to others.

353
00:40:52.083 --> 00:40:53.384
Not on my watch.

354
00:40:55.353 --> 00:40:57.689
No more innocence destroyed.

355
00:41:00.492 --> 00:41:03.629
You used to do the same.
Protect innocence.

356
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:08.667
Getting
emotionally attached...

357
00:41:08.667 --> 00:41:10.536
only leads to one thing...

358
00:41:13.104 --> 00:41:14.506
just ask Smithee.

359
00:41:21.146 --> 00:41:23.682
The baby. is it his?

360
00:41:28.353 --> 00:41:29.487
I need to call my handler.

361
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:30.589
What? No.

362
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:32.891
He's the only man
on this planet I trust.

363
00:41:32.891 --> 00:41:34.259
We can't trust anyone.

364
00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:36.194
You have
a better solution?

365
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.998
Fine.

366
00:41:39.998 --> 00:41:42.133
We need to
deactivate the signal jammer

367
00:41:42.133 --> 00:41:44.002
to get a call out.

368
00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:45.937
You stay here.

369
00:41:45.937 --> 00:41:49.507
I need to... to turn off
the signal jammer.

370
00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:50.709
Where's that?

371
00:41:52.377 --> 00:41:53.679
Security cabin.

372
00:41:53.679 --> 00:41:54.813
Let me go.

373
00:41:54.813 --> 00:41:56.782
I can walk this off.

374
00:41:56.782 --> 00:41:59.117
I can walk now.

375
00:41:59.117 --> 00:42:00.686
Just keep her alive.

376
00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:06.057
I can do that.

377
00:42:06.057 --> 00:42:07.826
You make sure he does.

378
00:42:48.366 --> 00:42:51.569
This man.
what is he like?

379
00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:52.638
Pure evil.

380
00:43:06.217 --> 00:43:08.019
What's that
around your neck?

381
00:43:12.123 --> 00:43:13.692
Nothing.

382
00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:15.994
You got family?

383
00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.966
Not anymore.

384
00:43:23.835 --> 00:43:25.370
I'm sorry.

385
00:43:28.707 --> 00:43:31.810
My job
is easier alone anyway.

386
00:43:34.379 --> 00:43:38.516
If it's easier alone.
why did you help us?

387
00:43:38.516 --> 00:43:39.885
Elda knew you would.

388
00:43:41.519 --> 00:43:43.354
She's done
her homework.

389
00:43:44.823 --> 00:43:47.025
She knows my past identities.

390
00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:51.162
After long enough.
your past lives become a rumor.

391
00:43:51.162 --> 00:43:52.798
legend even.

392
00:43:54.199 --> 00:43:57.235
And she's been around
long enough to hear them.

393
00:43:57.235 --> 00:43:59.070
So. you used to help people

394
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.340
and then you stopped.
and now you're helping me?

395
00:44:07.212 --> 00:44:09.781
I'm just trying
to survive the night.

396
00:44:12.818 --> 00:44:14.319
Whatever you say.

397
00:45:42.207 --> 00:45:44.175
You need me. little one.

398
00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:45.844
You know you do.

399
00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.682
Drink this.

400
00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:53.251
Thanks.

401
00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:55.486
Don't fall asleep.

402
00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:58.489
You seem to be moving better.

403
00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:02.760
Got more guns.

404
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.463
God. sit down.
Let me look at that.

405
00:46:05.463 --> 00:46:09.100
It's okay.
It's just a scratch.

406
00:46:10.468 --> 00:46:11.970
Jesus. Alexa.

407
00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:14.806
Alexa?
Is that your real name?

408
00:46:14.806 --> 00:46:17.575
For now. You?

409
00:46:17.575 --> 00:46:20.211
Scott. for now.

410
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:30.321
Mission successful.
Except for a few mishaps.

411
00:46:30.321 --> 00:46:33.491
It's only
a small stab wound to the chest.

412
00:46:33.491 --> 00:46:35.793
The only thing
we need now is phones.

413
00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:37.662
The cloakroom.

414
00:46:37.662 --> 00:46:39.831
You able to function
on that leg now?

415
00:46:39.831 --> 00:46:41.466
I have to.

416
00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:44.102
Okay. Okay. I'm done.

417
00:46:44.102 --> 00:46:47.738
I'm done. That's cute.

418
00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:49.140
Yeah.

419
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.410
Even when in the dirtiest
of waters.

420
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:56.514
a lotus still produces
the most amazing flower.

421
00:46:56.514 --> 00:46:58.649
I love that.

422
00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.085
It's a symbol
of rebirth.

423
00:47:00.085 --> 00:47:02.753
Okay. okay.
I've got a sensitive side.

424
00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:04.422
We get it.

425
00:47:07.358 --> 00:47:08.326
Breathe.

426
00:47:08.326 --> 00:47:10.795
Is she okay?

427
00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:12.898
I'm fine.

428
00:47:12.898 --> 00:47:15.200
This time.
we stick together.

429
00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:19.537
Someone needs to make sure
you don't get stabbed.

430
00:47:21.372 --> 00:47:24.175
She's killed
three of our men

431
00:47:24.175 --> 00:47:27.312
to get to a signal jammer.
and there's no sign of the girl.

432
00:47:27.312 --> 00:47:30.081
So. what exactly
are you still doing out here?

433
00:47:30.081 --> 00:47:32.583
Useless morons.
I'm going in.

434
00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:35.153
The girl alive. Keates.

435
00:47:35.153 --> 00:47:37.422
Are you gonna make yourself
useful or what?

436
00:47:47.465 --> 00:47:49.334
I don't know about you but...

437
00:47:51.002 --> 00:47:54.539
...I think the time
for subtlety's over.

438
00:47:58.977 --> 00:48:02.547
He always needs
something big to hide behind.

439
00:48:19.497 --> 00:48:21.666
This place
is a bloody maze.

440
00:48:42.988 --> 00:48:44.355
Ugh.

441
00:48:53.031 --> 00:48:54.665
Who wants a job?

442
00:49:00.205 --> 00:49:02.940
Sorry.

443
00:49:21.993 --> 00:49:23.028
Go. go. go. go.

444
00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:27.365
Well. well. well.

445
00:49:30.035 --> 00:49:31.869
Come on!

446
00:49:33.838 --> 00:49:37.475
You see?
Fuck off subtlety

447
00:49:37.475 --> 00:49:42.647
and the universe will
open itself up to you.

448
00:49:48.386 --> 00:49:49.954
Fuck's sake.

449
00:49:56.361 --> 00:49:57.428
Thank you.

450
00:50:10.475 --> 00:50:12.277
Aaaahhh!

451
00:50:36.301 --> 00:50:38.403
Shit! Fucking bullets.

452
00:50:38.403 --> 00:50:40.037
Fucking thing.

453
00:51:31.689 --> 00:51:33.158
Grenade?

454
00:51:33.158 --> 00:51:36.927
Way too loud.
It'll blow the phones.

455
00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.129
I have smoke.

456
00:51:38.129 --> 00:51:40.598
Of course. you have.

457
00:51:40.598 --> 00:51:42.467
One bullet left.

458
00:51:47.205 --> 00:51:49.440
You stay here.

459
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.342
You. with me.

460
00:53:18.463 --> 00:53:19.830
- Fuck.
- Hah!

461
00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:23.100
I told you!

462
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.636
What'd I tell you?
Don't fuck with me.

463
00:53:25.636 --> 00:53:27.171
- Just doing anything.
- Egh!

464
00:53:27.171 --> 00:53:28.973
Aah!

465
00:53:28.973 --> 00:53:30.541
What the fuck!

466
00:53:33.844 --> 00:53:35.513
Yeah. scream.

467
00:53:35.513 --> 00:53:37.515
Pretty little thing. ain't you?

468
00:53:37.515 --> 00:53:39.016
Show me your teeth.

469
00:53:39.016 --> 00:53:40.485
Hold still.

470
00:53:41.652 --> 00:53:42.787
Scott!

471
00:53:42.787 --> 00:53:45.155
They said they wanted you alive.

472
00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:48.092
but they didn't say nothing
about your teeth.

473
00:53:55.500 --> 00:54:01.005
Eeeny... meeny... miny... moe.

474
00:54:01.005 --> 00:54:02.307
Aaaaghh!

475
00:54:05.676 --> 00:54:09.447
- Fucker.
- Aaah.

476
00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:27.532
Walker.

477
00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:33.471
He's not breathing.

478
00:54:33.471 --> 00:54:35.406
Scott? No.

479
00:54:35.406 --> 00:54:38.108
- Scott?
- Come on. you big lug.

480
00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:39.577
Fight.

481
00:54:39.577 --> 00:54:41.346
You can't let this beat you!

482
00:54:41.346 --> 00:54:45.015
Fight!

483
00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:46.484
Fight!

484
00:54:51.356 --> 00:54:52.823
Daddy...

485
00:54:58.363 --> 00:55:01.766
Are you two okay?

486
00:55:01.766 --> 00:55:05.370
Never better.

487
00:55:06.937 --> 00:55:10.174
Slow down. cowboy.
You need to take it easy.

488
00:55:11.542 --> 00:55:15.813
No time.

489
00:55:21.986 --> 00:55:24.221
Thank you.

490
00:55:32.497 --> 00:55:33.631
Speak.

491
00:55:33.631 --> 00:55:36.333
The compound's been sieged.

492
00:55:36.333 --> 00:55:39.437
I need two cars now.

493
00:55:39.437 --> 00:55:41.138
One hour.

494
00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:47.778
We need to lay low
for one hour.

495
00:55:47.778 --> 00:55:48.979
An hour?

496
00:55:50.981 --> 00:55:52.282
We can lay low for an hour.

497
00:55:52.282 --> 00:55:53.684
I wonder if this place
has got some whisky.

498
00:55:53.684 --> 00:55:55.152
We need to find
somewhere to hide.

499
00:55:55.152 --> 00:55:56.320
We need our documents.

500
00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.655
What?

501
00:56:04.862 --> 00:56:06.831
It's back in the other building.

502
00:56:06.831 --> 00:56:08.999
Why didn't we think
about this before?

503
00:56:08.999 --> 00:56:11.135
They may not even be made.

504
00:56:11.135 --> 00:56:14.539
We have to try.
She has to disappear today.

505
00:56:16.541 --> 00:56:17.875
Let's go.

506
00:56:24.482 --> 00:56:26.050
Can't hide forever.

507
00:56:29.554 --> 00:56:31.321
You okay?

508
00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:34.825
I hope so.

509
00:56:34.825 --> 00:56:36.293
Come on!

510
00:56:41.999 --> 00:56:44.001
You hide behind there.

511
00:56:44.001 --> 00:56:45.570
What you gonna do?

512
00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:47.938
- Come on.
- I'll grab his attention.

513
00:56:47.938 --> 00:56:51.008
When he come. you go.

514
00:56:51.008 --> 00:56:52.843
You're injured.
Have you seen that guy?

515
00:56:52.843 --> 00:56:54.178
I'll be fine.

516
00:56:56.547 --> 00:56:57.882
I'll see you.

517
00:57:07.492 --> 00:57:08.993
Gotcha.

518
00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.855
I know you're in here...

519
00:57:43.694 --> 00:57:48.699
And I know you're protecting
that pretty little thing.

520
00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:58.676
Have no doubt. I'm gonna
break your fucking neck.

521
00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:01.812
And not because of the money
they've offered me.

522
00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:03.981
No. It's more than that.

523
00:58:03.981 --> 00:58:05.349
I remember you.

524
00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:09.286
I've been waiting for this.

525
00:58:09.286 --> 00:58:11.155
Aaaahh!

526
00:58:25.369 --> 00:58:27.337
As long as you live.

527
00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:29.373
there'll always be
something waiting.

528
00:58:44.922 --> 00:58:46.023
Painful.

529
00:58:54.298 --> 00:58:55.800
Fuck.

530
00:58:57.101 --> 00:58:59.336
Go find the documents.

531
00:59:02.172 --> 00:59:03.273
And hide.

532
00:59:23.828 --> 00:59:25.730
Painful.

533
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:27.164
Hell yeah.

534
00:59:43.013 --> 00:59:44.214
Run!

535
00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.355
Hah!

536
01:00:22.887 --> 01:00:25.022
You're gonna love this.

537
01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:56.553
Fuck.

538
01:01:19.043 --> 01:01:21.345
Much better.

539
01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:22.813
Now. my dear.

540
01:01:24.882 --> 01:01:27.651
I know it sounds cliché

541
01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:29.754
but there really is

542
01:01:29.754 --> 01:01:32.890
a hard way or an easy way.

543
01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:51.375
Right.

544
01:01:54.979 --> 01:01:56.146
Suit yourself.

545
01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:05.322
Now before I dispatch you.

546
01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:07.657
make yourself useful.

547
01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:10.027
The girl. where is she?

548
01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:19.036
The old double back. ey?

549
01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:21.531
Come out. come out
wherever you are.

550
01:03:25.169 --> 01:03:27.471
Oh. sweet Juliet.

551
01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:30.440
I won't hurt you. Promise.

552
01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:50.995
It seems
you're wounded. little one.

553
01:03:50.995 --> 01:03:53.030
Wouldn't want to hurt
the baby now. would you?

554
01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:23.693
Wherefore art thou?

555
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.483
All right. princess.
Playtime's over.

556
01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:04.101
Aaahh!

557
01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:41.005
You know.
he might even let you go

558
01:05:42.106 --> 01:05:44.441
once he's ripped that creature
out of you.

559
01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:26.283
She's my baby.

560
01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:49.839
Now. you choose.

561
01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:55.445
The easy way or the hard way?

562
01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:59.015
I...I choose--

563
01:07:08.992 --> 01:07:10.427
I chose for you.

564
01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:40.657
I'm sure they won't mind
a few scratches.

565
01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:15.024
the innocent suffers.

566
01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:36.045
You were
doing this for me.

567
01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:44.354
Smithee. I guess
I've been here enough.

568
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.939
You didn't deserve this.

569
01:09:05.275 --> 01:09:06.510
None of you.

570
01:09:12.216 --> 01:09:14.584
You found them.

571
01:09:14.584 --> 01:09:19.155
Only mine.
I guess she only found yours.

572
01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:21.625
We have to find her.

573
01:09:23.527 --> 01:09:24.594
What you doing?

574
01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.838
Ah. I see.

575
01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:38.275
There I was thinking...

576
01:09:38.275 --> 01:09:41.311
There will be a car
for you outside.

577
01:09:41.311 --> 01:09:42.779
After everything...

578
01:09:46.283 --> 01:09:48.184
No attachment.

579
01:09:49.353 --> 01:09:50.854
Number one rule.

580
01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:51.988
I know about your past.

581
01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:53.056
You know nothing!

582
01:09:53.056 --> 01:09:54.791
I know what happened.

583
01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:03.166
Your little girl's mother.
killed in a revenge shooting

584
01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:06.370
because you got those hostages
out of Yemen.

585
01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:08.738
You were trying to do
the right thing

586
01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:11.174
and you were punished.

587
01:10:11.174 --> 01:10:12.342
But there comes a time--

588
01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:13.677
Time for what?

589
01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:15.845
My little girl
will never be safe

590
01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:18.948
if I'm not dead to her.

591
01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:21.651
That's how we survive.

592
01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:23.487
No attachment.

593
01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:29.926
You will find out one day.

594
01:10:32.696 --> 01:10:34.831
Go fuck yourself.

595
01:10:41.305 --> 01:10:43.039
Urgh!

596
01:12:05.221 --> 01:12:06.956
No. no. no.

597
01:12:34.117 --> 01:12:35.118
Ugh!

598
01:12:42.426 --> 01:12:43.927
One bullet left.

599
01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:47.697
Story of my life.

600
01:12:58.341 --> 01:12:59.543
About bloody time.

601
01:13:00.677 --> 01:13:03.346
And why is she bleeding?

602
01:13:03.346 --> 01:13:05.782
She better not be hurt. Keates.

603
01:13:05.782 --> 01:13:07.150
or it's both our heads.

604
01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:11.020
Oh. thank you. Keates.
for saving the day

605
01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.723
when all the pathetic boys
went and got themselves killed.

606
01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:17.260
They couldn't pick up
a girl in a bar.

607
01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:20.329
Come on.

608
01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.334
Open up.

609
01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:26.936
Argh!

610
01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:28.605
Fucking morons.

611
01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:34.377
Careful.

612
01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:05.241
Not bad.

613
01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:06.776
You're gonna watch this.

614
01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:17.386
Fucking hell.

615
01:14:41.611 --> 01:14:42.612
Aagh!

616
01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:51.314
You need to stay down.

617
01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:10.399
Eeeeegghhh!

618
01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.268
Not today. sweetheart.

619
01:16:17.473 --> 01:16:18.775
Fuck!

620
01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:20.677
I'll take you both on
one-handed [indistinct]--

621
01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:41.364
Mm.

622
01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:45.234
Are you both okay?

623
01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:47.103
I hope so.

624
01:16:58.047 --> 01:17:00.049
He won't stop
looking for us. will he?

625
01:17:05.889 --> 01:17:07.891
You need to
get out of here.

626
01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:10.326
I couldn't find
your paperwork.

627
01:17:10.326 --> 01:17:12.829
I'm really sorry.

628
01:17:12.829 --> 01:17:14.530
Our friend had them.

629
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.103
I'll be back in two minutes.

630
01:17:59.342 --> 01:18:01.477
You need this more than I do.

631
01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:05.548
Thank you.

632
01:19:00.603 --> 01:19:03.172
Get yourself
cleaned up.

633
01:19:03.172 --> 01:19:05.775
I have a job for you.

634
01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:12.782
There's something else I have to
do first.

635
01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:51.420
Oops.

636
01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:52.655
What?

637
01:19:52.655 --> 01:19:55.224
Quick. She's kicking.

638
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:02.698
Even she doesn't want you to go.

639
01:20:06.602 --> 01:20:08.471
It's not over for me.

640
01:20:10.439 --> 01:20:12.175
But it can be.

641
01:20:18.848 --> 01:20:22.986
There are girls out
there like you and that's on me.

642
01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:27.156
If they're still alive.
I have to try.

643
01:20:35.364 --> 01:20:36.699
Will you visit?

644
01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:41.037
Maybe.

645
01:20:54.884 --> 01:20:56.352
I'll break down every door.

646
01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:58.587
I'll smash in every skull
until she's recovered.

647
01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:01.490
For that. you have
my fucking word!

648
01:21:09.765 --> 01:21:10.900
The guests are all here.

649
01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.235
Stop hiding.

650
01:21:12.235 --> 01:21:15.972
I'm not hiding.
I'll be down in a minute...

651
01:21:15.972 --> 01:21:18.374
I have a business to run.

652
01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:29.986
You'll be sorry
you tried this.

653
01:21:29.986 --> 01:21:31.120
you chicken shit!

654
01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:33.489
Who you working for?

655
01:21:33.489 --> 01:21:35.891
I hired. fired. and murdered
ten of your kind

656
01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:36.926
before breakfast!

657
01:22:14.163 --> 01:22:15.264
Do you mind?

658
01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:36.885
Cuban. very nice.

659
01:22:41.057 --> 01:22:42.225
Who sent you?

660
01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:46.162
Who you working for?

661
01:22:55.338 --> 01:22:56.972
Big mistake.

662
01:22:58.374 --> 01:22:59.942
Getting attached.

663
01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:06.582
I thought you knew better.

664
01:23:06.582 --> 01:23:11.687
And what are you doing here
then?

665
01:23:11.687 --> 01:23:14.623
She can't be paying you.

666
01:23:14.623 --> 01:23:17.260
You think you're special.

667
01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:22.998
You think you're righteous.
You're no different from me.

668
01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:26.169
You're no different
from the rest of us.

669
01:23:26.169 --> 01:23:29.105
What you doing here

670
01:23:29.105 --> 01:23:35.678
if not for some
disillusioned attachment?

671
01:23:36.979 --> 01:23:38.614
We're the same.

672
01:23:46.122 --> 01:23:48.224
No. We're not.

673
01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:51.827
You're scumbag.

674
01:23:51.827 --> 01:23:52.995
I'm making sure
she doesn't have to

675
01:23:52.995 --> 01:23:55.030
look over her shoulder again.

676
01:23:58.301 --> 01:23:59.702
Who are you?

677
01:24:05.108 --> 01:24:06.109
I'm nobody.
