always meant my first time.

We've seen many like you.

00:08:35.253 --> 00:08:38.300
Many think that they can
just take whatever they want.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.606
Who are you?

109
00:08:39.606 --> 00:08:41.999

and they both passed
away quite suddenly. so.

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:39.900
Dunno how. I think
like fate probably.

129
00:10:41.902 --> 00:10:44.426
and I've been here
like ever since.

130
00:10:46.123 --> 00:10:50.171
- So who's in charge
around here now?

131

Yeah. she went away for a
little while. but she came back.

133

Everyone always does that.
This place just calls to you.

00:11:04.751 --> 00:11:06.927
Drink up. It's gonna get cold.

I'm so sorry.

138
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.903
- It's okay.
- It slipped

139
00:11:26.903 --> 00:11:28.557
through my fingers.

140
00:11:28.557 --> 00:11:32.561

seen worse stains. [laughs]

141
00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:34.432
I'm really sorry.

142

you one another.

You don't have anything
stronger. do you?

It's just all temptation's
too great. so.

149
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.720
Is that something you
struggle with. alcohol?

150

'Cause if you wanna stay. like
all vices have to be stopped.

151

now and then. you know?

Okay. How about I go and find
you somewhere to sleep then?

[soft tense atmospheric music]

159
00:13:04.348 --> 00:13:06.742
- Hey. new girl. What are
you doing snooping around?

160
00:13:09.963 --> 00:13:11.529
I was just getting
some fresh air.

161
00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:14.141
What's your name?

162
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:18.014
Lola.

163
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.887
- You're far away
from home. Lola.

164
00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:30.592
What's that behind your back?

165
00:13:32.855 --> 00:13:36.076
- Uh-
- You can't drink that.

166
00:13:36.076 --> 00:13:38.078
- It's just a beer.
- It's not just a beer!

167
00:13:38.078 --> 00:13:39.993
We don't tolerate that here!

168
00:13:39.993 --> 00:13:41.124
- What are you so
freaked out about?

169
00:13:41.124 --> 00:13:42.822
I knew you were bad news.

170
00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:47.957
Who do you think you are?

171
00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:51.526
I come here with
nothing but the clothes

172
00:13:51.526 --> 00:13:54.007
on my back looking
for sanctuary. and you accuse me of what?

173
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.795
I thought this was a safe
place and talk of sisterhood.

174
00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:01.623
Sounds more like a regime to me.

175
00:14:01.623 --> 00:14:04.147
Hey. what's going on here?

176
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.542

some fresh air.

177
00:14:07.542 --> 00:14:09.370

[scoffs] Fresh air.

179
00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:13.287
- All right. stop
the both of you.

180
00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:15.071
You're gonna wake
up the whole camp.

181
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.075
Come to my caravan
and get rid of that.

182
00:14:25.777 --> 00:14:27.344
What are you doing
walking around?

183
00:14:27.692 --> 00:14:30.043
- I was just getting
some fresh air.

184
00:14:30.043 --> 00:14:32.828
- And drinking.
- It was one. all right?

185
00:14:32.828 --> 00:14:35.918
- The last one.
- Find that hard to believe.

186
00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:37.311
This isn't kindergarten.

187
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:39.922
If you would prefer.
you can leave now.

188
00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:44.100
No. okay. please. just look.

189
00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:47.147
I have nowhere else to go. okay?

190
00:14:47.147 --> 00:14:51.847
I came here especially because
I don't have anyone else.

191
00:14:54.763 --> 00:14:56.112
You're new here

192
00:14:56.286 --> 00:14:58.201
so I will give you the
benefit of the doubt.

193
00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:01.291
but you can't go
wandering around at night.

194
00:15:01.291 --> 00:15:03.815
- Why not?
- We're very private here.

195
00:15:03.815 --> 00:15:05.513
Everyone's whereabouts
are accounted for

196
00:15:05.513 --> 00:15:07.167
because it isn't safe at night.

197
00:15:07.167 --> 00:15:08.516
But why wouldn't it be safe?

198
00:15:14.783 --> 00:15:17.525
- I dunno how much you
already know about this place.

199
00:15:17.525 --> 00:15:20.745
We have communal times
and private time.

200
00:15:20.745 --> 00:15:22.747
Outside of that is work.

201
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.142
- You do know what
we do here. right?

202
00:15:28.014 --> 00:15:29.450
- We offer sanctuary to
those that travel through.

203
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.365
but they learn very
little of what we do.

204
00:15:33.628 --> 00:15:38.328
Those that stay have to prove
themselves and contribute.

205
00:15:42.158 --> 00:15:43.246
So what have I gotta do?

206
00:15:44.682 --> 00:15:47.816
- For now. stay in
your caravan at night

207
00:15:47.816 --> 00:15:48.948
and no more alcohol.

208
00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:56.042
- Respecting our rules is
the first step. All right?

209
00:15:56.042 --> 00:15:59.262
- Well. I'm sorry.
okay? I didn't know.

210
00:16:00.437 --> 00:16:01.177
It's okay.

211
00:16:02.178 --> 00:16:03.701
Tomorrow we'll show you around.

212
00:16:03.701 --> 00:16:06.052
and we can discuss how
you can contribute.

213
00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:08.750
Thank you.

214
00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:14.060
[footsteps shuffle]

215
00:16:16.062 --> 00:16:19.674
- I don't trust her.
- She's new.

216
00:16:19.674 --> 00:16:21.981
You don't like change.
We all know that.

217
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.591
When Simone comes back.

218
00:16:23.591 --> 00:16:25.897
she'll let us know if there's
anything to worry about.

219
00:16:25.897 --> 00:16:28.509
For now. she's a guest.

220
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:31.164

225
00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:57.799
Do you...

226
00:17:01.977 --> 00:17:03.892
[laughs] Spit it out.

227
00:17:08.418 --> 00:17:11.856
- Does everyone
here do sex work?

228
00:17:11.856 --> 00:17:14.076
[laughs] Not everyone.

229
00:17:15.991 --> 00:17:18.211
I mean. you don't have to
if that's what you mean.

230
00:17:19.734 --> 00:17:21.910
I dunno how else you'd
make your money though.

231
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.043
'Cause that's our
main source of income.

232
00:17:28.351 --> 00:17:30.484
Oh God. you're not
a virgin. are you?

233
00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:31.659
No.

234
00:17:31.659 --> 00:17:34.792
[women laugh]

235
00:17:34.792 --> 00:17:38.274
You know. all I've ever wanted
is somewhere to call home.

236
00:17:38.274 --> 00:17:40.059
even if that means
I have to work.

237
00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:44.715
It's not dirty. you know.

238
00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:46.369
not as society would
have you believe.

239
00:17:46.369 --> 00:17:49.503
Like there's a stigma
attached to it. obviously.

240
00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:50.982
but you're in control.

241
00:17:50.982 --> 00:17:53.376
Look. it's just a job. you know?

242
00:17:53.376 --> 00:17:57.163
Some enjoy it more
than others. but yeah.

243
00:17:57.163 --> 00:18:00.427
we make the rules and. you know.

244
00:18:00.427 --> 00:18:03.212
let's just say we don't
respond well to mistreatment.

245
00:18:05.301 --> 00:18:06.650
You're in charge?

246
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.740
[water drips]

247
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.441
If I do stay. when
will I have to...

248
00:18:16.747 --> 00:18:18.967
No. it's up to Simone.

249
00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:21.752
but you will have to pay
your way somehow. so.

250
00:18:27.758 --> 00:18:29.412
You safe now. you know that?

- Oh. she's back.

258
00:19:13.543 --> 00:19:17.025
The queen has arrived.

259
00:19:17.025 --> 00:19:18.548
- How'd it go?
- Smooth as silk.

260
00:19:20.246 --> 00:19:21.856
What are you up to?

261
00:19:21.856 --> 00:19:23.162
- Oh. I just had some
unfinished business.

262
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.989
It's all sorted now. [laughs]

263
00:19:24.989 --> 00:19:26.643
Could have given you hand.

264
00:19:26.643 --> 00:19:28.906
- Well. don't worry about
it. It's my burden to bear.

265
00:19:28.906 --> 00:19:31.257
- As long as you're all good.
- We're good.

266
00:19:32.867 --> 00:19:34.738
So what are we playing?

267
00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:39.961
[speaks indistinctly]

268
00:19:43.747 --> 00:19:44.531
You play poker?

269
00:19:46.097 --> 00:19:48.012
- [Lola] I dunno how to
play anything. actually.

270
00:19:48.012 --> 00:19:50.058
No. I'll show you. It's easy.

271
00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:51.842
You know how to bluff. right?

272
00:19:51.842 --> 00:19:55.019
- Is that like lying
about what card you have?

273
00:19:55.019 --> 00:19:57.413
- Sort of.
- Okay. [laughs]

What have I done? Why am I here?

282
00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:48.464
- Be quiet.
- This isn't funny.

283
00:20:48.464 --> 00:20:50.423
- You've been dishonest. Tina.
- What?

284
00:20:52.686 --> 00:20:55.863
- There's no use lying now.
- No. I didn't mean to.

285
00:20:55.863 --> 00:20:59.127
- That's no excuse.
- No.

286
00:20:59.127 --> 00:21:01.216
- You know the punishment
for dishonesty.

287
00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:02.565
Please. I won't do it again!

288
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:07.048
You fed without the sisters.

289
00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:10.660
- [Tina] Please. There
has to be another way.

290
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.619

you think you're alone?

indistinctly] to you before.

I felt like he was over here.

306
00:22:55.983 --> 00:22:58.159
- Well I haven't seen any
visitors here tonight.

307

Anyway. like I should go.

[birds chirp]
[door opens]

325
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:18.125
- Hey.
- Hi. [chuckles]

326
00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:21.258
- Have you seen Tina?
- She's no longer with us.

327
00:25:23.086 --> 00:25:25.045
Oh.

328
00:25:25.045 --> 00:25:27.526
- She broke the rules.
so we asked her to leave.

329
00:25:30.964 --> 00:25:32.139
What role did she break?

330
00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:37.840
- She was being selfish and
we share everything here.

331
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.929
not take things for ourselves.

332
00:25:41.975 --> 00:25:43.629
I see.

333
00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:45.761
- The rules are there for a
reason. They keep us all safe.

334
00:25:49.199 --> 00:25:50.505
Do you know where she went?

335
00:25:52.768 --> 00:25:56.685
- I don't know. Wherever
the wind takes her.

336
00:26:01.734 --> 00:26:03.431
- I liked her.
- We all did.

337
00:26:04.998 --> 00:26:08.610
She was one of us. but
sometimes we lose our way.

338
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.786
and we have to say goodbye.

339
00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:17.053
- Yeah. do you think
she'll be back?

340
00:26:17.053 --> 00:26:19.578
I mean. Monica said something
about sometimes we leave.

341
00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:22.668
but then something
pulls us back.

342
00:26:24.626 --> 00:26:25.366

351
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.045
- Did you find your friend?
- No.

352
00:27:38.178 --> 00:27:39.919
His parents haven't
seen him either.

353
00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:43.052
[Lola] It's strange.

354
00:27:43.052 --> 00:27:47.274
- But you haven't seen
anything just weird going on?

355
00:27:51.582 --> 00:27:53.193
- Like what?
- Don't really know.

356
00:27:55.108 --> 00:27:58.633
There's just something
about this place.

357
00:28:01.288 --> 00:28:01.680
You know. I feel like
I've come here once.

358
00:28:03.594 --> 00:28:06.946
Just I don't really remember
what happened and. you know.

359
00:28:08.861 --> 00:28:09.905
I haven't seen my
friend in a few days.

360
00:28:09.905 --> 00:28:12.212
and I just felt like
he was here. too.

361
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:14.823
[laughs] You're funny.

362
00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:20.873
Why?

363
00:28:20.873 --> 00:28:23.614
- [laughs] It don't
make any sense.

364
00:28:23.614 --> 00:28:25.442
What. you thought
you came here once.

365
00:28:25.442 --> 00:28:26.705
but you can't remember?

366
00:28:28.358 --> 00:28:29.490
Sure you would.

367
00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:40.936
What's your name?

368
00:28:42.764 --> 00:28:47.769
Gabe. well. Gabriel. [laughs]

369
00:28:51.817 --> 00:28:54.950
- Well. I'm Lola.
- It's nice to meet ya.

370
00:29:07.833 --> 00:29:11.575
- So did you really come
here looking for your friend.

371
00:29:11.575 --> 00:29:15.362
or was that just an
excuse to come see me?

372
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.193
No. he. he really is missing.

373
00:29:23.631 --> 00:29:24.371
Oh.

374
00:29:25.851 --> 00:29:30.203
- But yeah. I like
talking to ya.

375
00:29:32.335 --> 00:29:37.036
- I like talking to you. too.
I was hoping you'd come back.

376
00:29:39.386 --> 00:29:40.126
- Really?
- Mm.

377
00:29:45.392 --> 00:29:49.352
- Quite interesting. [laughs]
- [laughs] Interesting.

378
00:29:51.441 --> 00:29:53.792
- Is that it?
- I mean. sure. You're pretty.

379
00:30:08.284 --> 00:30:12.332
- Look. I really have
to go find my friend.

380
00:30:12.332 --> 00:30:17.032
Hmm. Surely it can wait.

381
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:24.431
[feet thud]
[Gabriel grunts]

382
00:30:26.912 --> 00:30:29.653
- Can I see you
again another time?

383
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:38.488
If you want to.

384
00:30:38.488 --> 00:30:40.926
- See you then.
- Yeah. okay. See ya.

385
00:30:42.623 --> 00:30:45.452
[dark tense music]

386
00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.467
[hisses echo]

387
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.941
[soft tense atmospheric music]

388
00:31:39.941 --> 00:31:44.641
[leaves rustle]
[birds chirp]

389
00:31:47.688 --> 00:31:50.952
[gasps] Hi.

390
00:31:50.952 --> 00:31:53.259
- Are you busy?
- No.

391
00:31:54.869 --> 00:31:56.218
Simone wants to see you.

392
00:32:00.005 --> 00:32:04.531
[heels clack]
[dark brooding music]

393
00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:09.144

00:32:22.114 --> 00:32:26.988
[rocks thud]
[hisses echo]

395
00:32:31.558 --> 00:32:32.559
Hello. Lola.

396
00:32:37.216 --> 00:32:39.479
I have been dying to meet you.

397
00:32:44.136 --> 00:32:45.746
How have you found
it here so far?

398
00:32:48.357 --> 00:32:50.751
- Yeah. good.
- I'm glad.

399
00:32:52.796 --> 00:32:54.189
We're a very close family here.

400
00:32:56.148 --> 00:33:00.761
Your presence is both a
blessing and an inconvenience.

401
00:33:04.634 --> 00:33:05.418
I don't understand.

402
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.510
- We have to be careful
who we let in our camp.

403
00:33:12.294 --> 00:33:14.514
There are many who
wish to see us perish.

404
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:17.299
Well. I'm not one of those.

405
00:33:20.955 --> 00:33:21.869
Why are you here?

406
00:33:26.656 --> 00:33:27.570
I have nowhere else.

407
00:33:30.443 --> 00:33:33.054
- You still have family?
- No. they're not my family.

408
00:33:34.751 --> 00:33:39.365
Not anymore. That part
of my life is over.

409
00:33:40.844 --> 00:33:42.107
[Simone] They out you?

410
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.375
I don't wanna talk about it.

411
00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:52.552
- The pain that you feel.
they hold power over you.

412
00:33:54.336 --> 00:33:57.252
You will forever be running
from it if you don't address it.

413
00:33:58.471 --> 00:34:01.256
I can help you with
that if you wish.

414
00:34:03.345 --> 00:34:04.042
How?

415
00:34:07.567 --> 00:34:11.397
- There is more to this place
than what you think you know.

416
00:34:14.008 --> 00:34:15.923
- I don't know much of
anything about this place.

417
00:34:15.923 --> 00:34:17.185
You know more than you let on.

418
00:34:23.148 --> 00:34:24.279
- Well. I know it
can be dangerous.

419
00:34:24.279 --> 00:34:25.672
Danger is relative.

420
00:34:28.283 --> 00:34:31.721
[dark dramatic music]

421
00:34:31.721 --> 00:34:34.072
[snakes hiss]

422
00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:41.035
There is danger from outside
and danger from within.

423
00:34:42.341 --> 00:34:43.907
Which category do
you fall under?

424
00:34:47.172 --> 00:34:49.435
- I dunno what you mean.
- Who's the boy?

425
00:34:53.526 --> 00:34:56.094
- That's Gabe.
- And why is he here?

426
00:34:57.399 --> 00:35:00.098
- Honestly. I dunno.
Oh. he's just curious.

427
00:35:02.622 --> 00:35:04.232
He thinks his friend is missing.

428
00:35:04.232 --> 00:35:08.541
- Curiosity can be the beginning
of something dangerous.

429
00:35:10.543 --> 00:35:14.329
but first. you have to
earn your place here.

430
00:35:16.201 --> 00:35:20.118
We all have to earn our
place. Will that be an issue?

431
00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:26.428
- No.
- The body is a vessel.

432
00:35:28.256 --> 00:35:32.695
a conduit before we shed
our skin and emerge anew.

433
00:35:35.437 --> 00:35:40.007
What we do here. it is
nothing to be ashamed of.

434
00:35:40.007 --> 00:35:42.357
- I don't-
- If you want to.

435
00:35:42.357 --> 00:35:45.273
if you wanna be a part
of this. you'll have to.

436
00:35:49.059 --> 00:35:50.235
I don't want you talking to him.

437
00:35:53.238 --> 00:35:55.240
- Why not?
- We have to be careful.

438
00:35:57.198 --> 00:35:58.504
You might say the wrong thing.

439
00:36:00.027 --> 00:36:01.463
He might get the
wrong impression.

440
00:36:01.463 --> 00:36:03.726
So I can't talk
to whoever I want?

441
00:36:06.381 --> 00:36:09.602
[snakes hiss and rattle]

442
00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.477
- You can talk to him. but
don't get too attached.

443
00:36:17.566 --> 00:36:21.179
- He's pure.
- What do you mean pure?

444
00:36:23.746 --> 00:36:24.965
Untouched.

445
00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:30.623
- [chuckles] That
explains a lot.

446
00:36:33.713 --> 00:36:36.063
- I only say this to save
you from the inevitable.

447
00:36:38.065 --> 00:36:40.023
Once you're a part of
us. you'll understand.

448
00:36:45.072 --> 00:36:46.465
Can I ask you something?

449
00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:51.296
Why did I come back?

450
00:36:54.212 --> 00:36:54.995
- Mm-hmm.

451
00:36:56.605 --> 00:36:59.478
I don't know.

452
00:36:59.478 --> 00:37:00.827
There was something
drawing me here.

453
00:37:02.045 --> 00:37:03.612
like a voice calling to me.

454
00:37:07.921 --> 00:37:12.447
I see something in you.
Lola. something special.

455
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.800
[tense brooding music]

456
00:37:31.945 --> 00:37:34.295
[birds chirp]

457
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:48.657
- Hey. new girl.
That'll be you soon.

458
00:37:53.358 --> 00:37:55.360
When are you gonna contribute?

459
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.581
- Soon.
- You just come from Simone's?

460
00:38:03.759 --> 00:38:07.459
- How'd it go?
- Yeah. fine.

461
00:38:09.939 --> 00:38:12.899
She's very strict.

462
00:38:14.466 --> 00:38:17.599
- She can be tough. but
it probably didn't help

463
00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:19.166
that you were with
that guy last night.

464
00:38:23.213 --> 00:38:25.651
- How do you know that?
- Little birdie told me.

465
00:38:27.696 --> 00:38:29.524
Well. you didn't do a
very good job hiding it.

466
00:38:29.524 --> 00:38:31.526
I just assume you wanted
everyone to find out.

467
00:38:31.526 --> 00:38:32.832
- I wasn't trying
to hide anything.

468
00:38:32.832 --> 00:38:36.444
- Doesn't matter. We
don't do interlopers.

469
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:41.406
You think I'm an interloper?

470
00:38:45.932 --> 00:38:48.413
You really are
something. aren't ya?

471
00:38:48.413 --> 00:38:50.066
Oh. what do you actually
have against me?

472
00:38:50.066 --> 00:38:54.027
- I don't trust you. The young
ones. they're all the same.

473
00:38:54.027 --> 00:38:57.073
They just take. take. take.
and when things get real.

474
00:38:58.423 --> 00:39:01.730
- then they leave.
- Well. if you knew me.

475
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.341
you'd know that's
not my intention.

476
00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:05.430
Well. I don't know you.

477
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:07.083
but I want you to
prove that you want

478
00:39:07.083 --> 00:39:09.477
to be here and stay here.

479
00:39:09.477 --> 00:39:11.784
Till then. I'll just
hold my opinion.

480
00:39:13.394 --> 00:39:14.177
Bitch.

481
00:39:17.398 --> 00:39:18.356
Takes one to know one.

[door clicks shut]

486
00:40:07.535 --> 00:40:10.277
- I can't keep doing this.
- It wasn't my fault.

487
00:40:10.277 --> 00:40:11.931
- It wasn't your fault?
- It just happened.

488
00:40:11.931 --> 00:40:16.283
- [Simone] Really? We can't
do this clean up all the time.

489
00:40:25.205 --> 00:40:27.512
[door thuds]

490

492
00:40:46.269 --> 00:40:47.314
- Thanks.
- Okay.

[door thuds shut]

[knock thuds]

495
00:40:57.542 --> 00:41:01.284
- [Monica] Did you forget
something? Come in.

496
00:41:02.677 --> 00:41:04.897
[door opens]

497
00:41:04.897 --> 00:41:07.116
- Is this bad time?
- No. come in.

498

[footsteps shuffle]
[door thuds shut]

499
00:41:14.863 --> 00:41:17.562
What can I do for ya?

500
00:41:17.562 --> 00:41:19.651
Did you hear what was going on

501
00:41:19.651 --> 00:41:21.043
in Star's caravan last night?

502
00:41:23.132 --> 00:41:27.441
- No. I was working. I
didn't hear anything. why?

503
00:41:27.441 --> 00:41:30.052
It was like screaming.

504
00:41:32.098 --> 00:41:36.668
- [laughs] It was probably
screams of joy. [laughs]

505
00:41:36.668 --> 00:41:39.453
- Men do that sometimes.
- It wasn't screams of joy.

506
00:41:39.453 --> 00:41:44.153
- It was like painful.
- I didn't hear anything.

507
00:41:48.636 --> 00:41:51.378
- You didn't or you
just won't tell me?

508
00:42:03.259 --> 00:42:04.522
Do really want to go there?

509
00:42:06.828 --> 00:42:10.528
- Yeah. I wanna know
what's going on.

510
00:42:10.528 --> 00:42:12.573
[sighs] All right.

511
00:42:12.573 --> 00:42:15.054
Give me like two
minutes to get dressed.

512
00:42:16.838 --> 00:42:17.622
I'll take ya.

513
00:42:20.668 --> 00:42:25.368
[tense brooding music]
[frogs chirp]

514
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:29.895
Well. you wanted to see it.

515
00:42:31.766 --> 00:42:34.377
- Oh my God.
- We call it a snake pit.

516
00:42:35.988 --> 00:42:38.860
It's just a fun thing
we throw around.

517
00:42:48.522 --> 00:42:49.784
Who are they?

518
00:42:51.177 --> 00:42:52.526
Just bad men.

519
00:42:56.443 --> 00:42:58.619
What did they do?

520
00:42:58.619 --> 00:43:00.969
They just got out of line.

521
00:43:00.969 --> 00:43:02.580
and they had to pay
the consequence.

522
00:43:05.104 --> 00:43:09.456
- That's murder.
- That's a gray area.

523
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.244
Yeah. they got murdered.
but it's just self defense.

524
00:43:15.244 --> 00:43:18.421
Like when put in a position
where you're taken advantage of

525
00:43:18.421 --> 00:43:22.251
by a man. the only
option is to fight back.

526
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:23.601
That is not fighting back!

527
00:43:25.472 --> 00:43:27.474
- Yeah. sometimes
it goes too far.

528
00:43:29.345 --> 00:43:30.912
but sometimes they go too far.

529
00:43:35.047 --> 00:43:37.832
Look. right? You're beautiful.

530
00:43:39.268 --> 00:43:39.747
You're young.

531
00:43:41.531 --> 00:43:45.144
How many times has a guy
said something inappropriate.

532
00:43:47.146 --> 00:43:49.714
or how many times has a guy
done something inappropriate?

533
00:43:49.714 --> 00:43:51.063
It's only a matter of time

534
00:43:51.063 --> 00:43:52.760
before they don't
take no for an answer.

535
00:43:55.067 --> 00:43:59.898
There's a lot of those.
We're not here to be abused.

536
00:44:05.773 --> 00:44:08.210
- How often does it happen?
- Not often.

537
00:44:10.909 --> 00:44:12.258
We have regulars
that are harmless.

538
00:44:12.258 --> 00:44:15.740
so we'll set you up with
one of them to start.

539
00:44:20.005 --> 00:44:21.876
- So you all look
out for each other?

540
00:44:21.876 --> 00:44:25.706
- Yeah. always.
like safety first.

541
00:44:34.889 --> 00:44:36.891
- I think I'm ready.
- Yeah?

542
00:44:39.981 --> 00:44:43.289
- I wanna contribute.
- Okay. [laughs]

543
00:44:45.378 --> 00:44:48.947
All right. tomorrow night. me
and you. I'll do your hair.

544
00:44:51.079 --> 00:44:52.254
What's wrong with my hair?

545
00:44:57.956 --> 00:45:00.132

549
00:45:32.947 --> 00:45:34.949
Can I ask you something?

550
00:45:36.821 --> 00:45:38.953
That first day when I arrived.

551
00:45:41.434 --> 00:45:44.829
what was that thing you
tried to put in my tea?

552
00:45:47.396 --> 00:45:48.746
[Monica] It's just.

553
00:45:50.356 --> 00:45:53.968
it's just something that
helps you to transform.

554
00:45:56.536 --> 00:45:58.973
[Lola] Drugs? What was it?

555
00:46:05.023 --> 00:46:08.809
- [Monica] It's like a
cleansing healer thing.

556
00:46:13.205 --> 00:46:15.207
[Lola] Can I take it now?

557
00:46:18.993 --> 00:46:19.951
He knows?

558
00:46:25.521 --> 00:46:27.219
Okay. just a little bit.

559
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:32.354
You won't feel the full
effects. but it'll help.

- I'm sorry. I just.
I wanted to see ya.

571
00:48:18.939 --> 00:48:20.767
- You can't keep
showing up here.

572
00:48:20.767 --> 00:48:24.205
- Yeah. I know. but
I need to talk to ya.

573
00:48:25.641 --> 00:48:28.557
- About what? About
what happened last time?

574
00:48:28.557 --> 00:48:31.996
- No. just. I don't
think you're safe here.

575
00:48:34.868 --> 00:48:36.870
- Gabe. I'm fine.
- No. listen.

Bad things happen here.

- I know.
- You know?

578
00:48:50.101 --> 00:48:51.929
- You know. I've
seen what men can do.

579
00:48:53.669 --> 00:48:55.454
I've experienced
what men can do.

580
00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:04.376
- Yes. this is a bad place.
but we look after each other.

581
00:49:04.376 --> 00:49:05.681
We're like family.

582
00:49:05.681 --> 00:49:08.554
- [laughs] They're
not your family.

583
00:49:08.554 --> 00:49:10.208
- They're more family
than my own ever was.

584
00:49:10.208 --> 00:49:13.994
- All right. it's not the men
you have to be careful of.

585
00:49:13.994 --> 00:49:16.823
It's the women who work here.

586
00:49:16.823 --> 00:49:18.129
What are you talking about?

587
00:49:18.129 --> 00:49:19.782
- Look. I did not come
to argue with you.

588
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:22.133
I've come to warn ya.

589
00:49:23.917 --> 00:49:25.614
- All right. well. you've
warned me. Can you please leave?

590
00:49:25.614 --> 00:49:28.052
- Look. I am pretty sure
me and my friend were here.

591
00:49:30.228 --> 00:49:33.187
It's all just fuzzy
like in my head.

592
00:49:33.187 --> 00:49:36.060
but that is the only
thing that comes up.

593

It's like a dream
you never forget.

594
00:49:37.757 --> 00:49:39.150
Look. he never came home.

595
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.108
No one has seen him.
and I am pretty sure-

596
00:49:41.108 --> 00:49:43.371
- Well. he is not here if
that's what you're implying.

597
00:49:43.371 --> 00:49:45.112
I just want you to be safe.

598
00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:51.858
- You can't come in here
like Prince Charming

599
00:49:51.858 --> 00:49:54.817
and try to sweep me
off my feet. all right?

600
00:49:54.817 --> 00:49:56.863
Things like that don't
happen to people like me.

601
00:49:56.863 --> 00:49:58.169
That is not what I'm doing.

602

[Lola sighs]

603
00:50:07.308 --> 00:50:08.527

- Lola. please.
- No.

605
00:50:12.444 --> 00:50:13.662
I don't wanna see you again.

606

Just go. all right? Now.

[footsteps shuffle]

609
00:50:31.332 --> 00:50:35.641

look after yourself.

614
00:50:58.925 --> 00:51:02.363
- She's not too busy for me.
- There are rules.

615
00:51:02.363 --> 00:51:04.017
- Well. I don't care
about the rules right now.

616
00:51:04.017 --> 00:51:06.715
- Lola. this isn't
how we do things here.

[hisses echo]

618
00:51:33.438 --> 00:51:35.657

- What is it?

619
00:51:37.572 --> 00:51:40.793
- I wanna know what's going
on here. okay? All of it.

620
00:51:40.793 --> 00:51:41.837
I can't tell ya.

621
00:51:47.321 --> 00:51:51.282
I'd have to show you.
You ready for that?

622
00:51:54.372 --> 00:51:55.329
Yeah. I'm ready.

623
00:51:58.245 --> 00:52:00.595
- You're not ready.
- I am ready.

624
00:52:00.595 --> 00:52:02.380
There's no need to rush.

625
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.860
The destination is not the
answer to your questions.

626
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.210
- Have I not earned
my place here?

627
00:52:07.994 --> 00:52:09.126
Okay. what more do I have to do?

628
00:52:11.345 --> 00:52:13.782
- You've only just started.
- I am ready.

629
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.526
All right. look me in the eyes
and tell me I'm not ready.

630
00:52:24.184 --> 00:52:27.144
- Once we do this.
you can't go back.

631
00:52:30.582 --> 00:52:31.539
I wanna know.

632
00:52:35.152 --> 00:52:37.023

over the next three days. okay?

665

have something to do with that?

- Yeah. It just
helps you adjust.

667
00:57:33.537 --> 00:57:34.973
The dose should've
been given gradually.

668
00:57:34.973 --> 00:57:38.629
but the bit you were given
last night was a lot more.

669

[dark brooding music]

698
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:12.250

tell you. all right?

699
01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:13.860
I just. I can't be here anymore.

700
01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:16.515

Hey.

711
01:04:56.283 --> 01:04:59.678
- How did I get here?
- I. I brought you here.

712
01:05:00.809 --> 01:05:02.028
- Why?
- You fainted.

713
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:07.642
I didn't really know
what else to do.

714
01:05:11.081 --> 01:05:13.997
Look. you've had a fever
since you got here.

715
01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:16.216
That is. I think.

716
01:05:16.216 --> 01:05:19.654
Like you were saying
some pretty weird stuff.

717
01:05:21.091 --> 01:05:24.485
- Snakes come up a lot.
- I'm so sorry.

718
01:05:24.485 --> 01:05:25.269
It's okay.

719
01:05:26.835 --> 01:05:28.228
I just want you to be safe.

and you can say as
long as you like.

721
01:05:29.534 --> 01:05:32.885

- Oh God. no. I couldn't.

722
01:05:32.885 --> 01:05:36.106
- You barely know me.

- You're welcome.

724
01:05:47.378 --> 01:05:49.032
Where are you parents?

725
01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:51.164

Come on. sit down. okay?

- Nothing. I'm fine.
- Okay.

737
01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:56.099
Just need to step
out for a minute.

Ah. home sweet home.

best part of the trip.

Huh. must've gone out.

asleep. I'll go check on him.

- All right. I'll
do the unpacking.

it till tomorrow.

769

Put anything dirty
in the hamper.

01:12:53.891 --> 01:12:56.197

[footsteps crunch]

776
01:12:58.939 --> 01:13:00.027

Hey.

Oh my god. I thought
I'd never see you again.

792
01:14:38.952 --> 01:14:42.565
- I don't know what to do.
- I told you it wouldn't easy.

793
01:14:44.567 --> 01:14:45.350
No. it wasn't.

794
01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.700
Whose car is this?

795
01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:55.186
- I had to take it. Simone.
she kept calling me back.

796
01:14:55.186 --> 01:14:56.143
What else did she say?

797

[slow eerie music]

798
01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:08.721
[trunk clicks open]

799
01:15:13.465 --> 01:15:14.248
I'll get Simone.

800
01:15:17.251 --> 01:15:19.819

car. too. before anyone sees.

[flames crackle]

802

- You're home now.
That's all that matters.

805
01:16:11.436 --> 01:16:13.394
I think it was too soon.

806
01:16:13.394 --> 01:16:15.005
Your body didn't
have time to adjust.

807
01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:21.054
I thought you could handle
it. but I was wrong.

808
01:16:21.054 --> 01:16:25.755
- I can handle it.
It was just too much.

809
01:16:28.801 --> 01:16:31.804
- I panicked.
- It's okay.

810
01:16:31.804 --> 01:16:33.023
We all had to go through it.

811
01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.419
What happened? What did you see?

812
01:16:38.419 --> 01:16:43.250
Snakes. blood.

813
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:48.125
It will get better in time.

814
01:16:49.866 --> 01:16:53.391
and then you all feel
the power within you.

815
01:16:55.828 --> 01:16:58.265
I just want the pain to end.

816
01:16:58.265 --> 01:17:01.138
[dark dramatic music]

817
01:17:02.574 --> 01:17:03.575
Did you bring him?

818
01:17:13.716 --> 01:17:15.718
What are you gonna do to him?

819
01:17:15.718 --> 01:17:17.633
- We're gonna
sacrifice him to Manasa

820
01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:20.679
to complete your transformation.

821
01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:24.030
No. No. no. he's pure.

822
01:17:26.337 --> 01:17:28.469
Like you said yourself. We
don't hurt those who are pure.

823
01:17:28.469 --> 01:17:29.775
You got too close.

824
01:17:31.864 --> 01:17:33.866
I told her you
shouldn't. I did warn ya.

825
01:17:35.955 --> 01:17:39.002
- Is there no other way?
Please. I don't wanna kill him.

826
01:17:44.747 --> 01:17:45.748
We're not killing him.

827
01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:50.753
One thing you need to understand
is we are setting him free.

828
01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:56.497
free from hardship. free from
oppression. free from pain.

829
01:17:58.108 --> 01:18:00.371
This is the only way.

What's going on?

835

[hisses echo]

836
01:18:37.887 --> 01:18:41.107
- We are here today
to welcome Lola.

837
01:18:43.457 --> 01:18:47.853
She has lived with us. learned
our ways. observed our rules.

838
01:18:50.595 --> 01:18:54.077
She survived the first
part of the ritual.

839
01:18:54.077 --> 01:18:57.689
Imbibe in the vish so that
her body can appropriate.

840
01:18:58.777 --> 01:19:01.954
This is no easy feat.

841
01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:05.131
It takes everything you've got.

842
01:19:05.131 --> 01:19:08.831
mold you so that your body can
complete the transformation.

843
01:19:10.397 --> 01:19:13.183
We must be proud of Lola.

844
01:19:13.183 --> 01:19:16.490
as I was proud of
you when you did it.

845
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:20.625
- Lola.
- Go to him.

846

[Gabriel breathes shakily]
[Lola shushes]

847
01:19:29.503 --> 01:19:32.332
Look at me. Look at me.

848
01:19:32.332 --> 01:19:37.033
- I don't know what [speaks
indistinctly]. I'm sorry.

849
01:19:38.251 --> 01:19:41.080
You didn't do anything.

850
01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.300
- [Simone] Lola has
brought us the offering.

851
01:19:46.564 --> 01:19:48.000
What's that mean?

852
01:19:49.697 --> 01:19:52.048
Sh. you will see. It's okay.

853
01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.794
- This isn't right.
I never wanted this.

854
01:19:59.838 --> 01:20:01.797
It'll be over soon.

855
01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:03.146
- [Simone] We'll
make it painless.

856
01:20:05.583 --> 01:20:07.672
No. no. please. please.

857
01:20:08.586 --> 01:20:10.936
[hisses echo]

858
01:20:12.372 --> 01:20:15.114
No.

859
01:20:15.114 --> 01:20:17.595
[Gabriel gags]

860
01:20:21.468 --> 01:20:24.036
[venom sizzles]

861
01:20:24.036 --> 01:20:27.997
- We call to you. Please
bless this offering.

We call on you. Kalana.

869
01:20:54.893 --> 01:20:55.938
- We call on you.
- Kalana.

870
01:20:55.938 --> 01:20:58.027

872
01:21:05.904 --> 01:21:08.080
we are witnessing
