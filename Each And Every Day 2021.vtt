00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:31.532
- Hi.

4
00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.134
- Hi!
- Hi.

5
00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.935
- So happy you guys could
join the discussion today.

6
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.304
- Am I too loud?

7
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.672
I didn't really mess
with my microphone volume.

8
00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.309
- I wanna make sure that my
camera placement is right.

9
00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.011
Here. and then my laptop
straight ahead.

10
00:00:44.078 --> 00:00:46.347
- I just trust you to film
whatever angle

11
00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:47.615
you think you look best in.

12
00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:49.049
- [laughing]
- Okay. cool.

13
00:00:49.117 --> 00:00:50.318
- I'm just gonna have everyone
hold your hands

14
00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:51.852
sort of in front of your face

15
00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:53.721
and if everyone could clap
so we could sync audio

16
00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.889
that would be a huge help.

17
00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:57.057
- Hi. everyone.

18
00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:58.792
- Hey.
- Hi.

19
00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.529
- I was just thinking about.
like. how kind of cathartic

20
00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:07.635
this is to talk to people
that kind of understand...

21
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.370
kind of some
of the darker stuff

22
00:01:09.437 --> 00:01:10.971
that we've sort of
lived through.

23
00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:13.207
It's just that it's a great
feeling.

[mid-tempo music]

25
00:01:15.143 --> 00:01:17.978
- * Oh. yeah *

26
00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:20.047
* *

27
00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:24.084
* I am not the things
my family did *

28
00:01:24.152 --> 00:01:28.289
* I am not the voices
in my head *

29
00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:32.460
* I am not the pieces
of the brokenness *

30
00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:35.729
* Inside *

31
00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:40.234
* No. I am not mistakes
that I have made *

32
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:44.438
* Or any of the things
that cause me pain *

33
00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:51.412
* No. I am not the pieces
of the dream I left behind *

34
00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.451
* *

35
00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:10.298
- I think I knew.
I think I knew for a while.

36
00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:13.133
A lot of. like. my seventh
and eighth grade year

37
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:15.803
was me looking up. like.
depression tests online

38
00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.005
and doing different things
like that.

39
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.674
Like. I think that I had
a sense of it.

40
00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:23.677
- I think I knew that
I was sad. but...

41
00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:25.679
I didn't quite understand
depression fully

42
00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:27.715
'cause even when I was
in eighth grade.

43
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:31.285
it wasn't a very...
common subject amongst people.

44
00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:32.886
Only when I got
into high school

45
00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:36.224
did it start being voiced
by people. but I was very...

46
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.925
very confused.

47
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.927
- Depression didn't really kick
in. like. full-blown depression

48
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.830
until I was probably
in middle school.

49
00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.733
That's when I would hit these
bouts of just...

50
00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.003
this dark kind of sadness
I really couldn't understand.

51
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.807
- I felt alone
and I felt scared.

52
00:02:53.874 --> 00:02:57.345
and I was having these ideas
of what killing myself

53
00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.280
would even look like.

54
00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:02.350
- Probably the first time
I thought about suicide

55
00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:03.951
was when I was 13.

56
00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.754
- I would imagine what I would
look like in a casket

57
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.458
or I would imagine...

58
00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:13.160
kind of what my funeral
would look like.

59
00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:16.997
- I don't think I ever fully
wanted to die.

60
00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.034
I think I wanted to escape.

61
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.772
- I wasn't really able to
talk to my parents

62
00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:28.175
because I was just
an angsty kid. right?

63
00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:29.643
And when you're a kid.

64
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.445
you avoid your parents.
It's what you do.

65
00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:35.616
- I remember when I told my dad
about my suicide attempt.

66
00:03:35.683 --> 00:03:37.885
he took me to church

67
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.688
because he had thought
I was possessed.

68
00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:43.924
[chuckles]
I was like..."That is not it."

69
00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:56.203
[suspenseful music]

70
00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.275
* *

71
00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:18.592
- This is Annie
with YouthLine.

72
00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.193
What's going on tonight?

73
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.296
- All right. we have two
new texts in queue.

74
00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:24.698
Can anyone grab those?

75
00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.735
Thank you.

76
00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:32.940
* *

77
00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:34.274
All right. so they confirmed

78
00:04:34.342 --> 00:04:36.544
that they're having thoughts
of suicide.

79
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.145
- Okay.

80
00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:41.014
- I'm a lead volunteer
at the YouthLine.

81
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:42.683
I've been working
with YouthLine

82
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.952
a little over a year.

83
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.425
Part of why I love
doing this work

84
00:04:51.492 --> 00:04:55.162
is because of the personal
experience that I have.

85
00:04:56.096 --> 00:04:58.432
Freshman year of high school.
I tried to kill myself.

86
00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:01.134
It hit my family really hard

87
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:03.236
and when I was in that space.
I wasn't. like.

88
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.906
capable of thinking about how
it was affecting other people.

89
00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:07.808
which is generally how it is.

90
00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:11.579
I think I definitely
empathize with the fact

91
00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.547
that generally when people
are suicidal.

92
00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:15.282
it's really. really hard
to think about

93
00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:16.717
how it's gonna affect others.

94
00:05:16.784 --> 00:05:18.919
A lot of times. you feel like
others aren't gonna care

95
00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:22.055
and that's just what your brain
is telling you. which sucks.

96
00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.625
I had felt like that
for a long time.

97
00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:29.129
I think other people noticed.
but I've always been...

98
00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:32.666
for lack of a better word.
high functioning.

99
00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:35.936
* *

100
00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:37.805
At the beginning.
I tried to hide it

101
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:42.309
and I tried to not let people
know what was going on for me.

102
00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:47.881
But freshman year was when
stuff kind of got scattered.

103
00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:52.052
I was hospitalized
for the suicide attempt.

104
00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:54.755
I was kind of like
in and out of the hospital

105
00:05:54.822 --> 00:05:56.857
a lot of my freshman year

106
00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:58.592
and was just really. really
struggling with. like.

107
00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.327
talking about
what was going on for me

108
00:06:00.394 --> 00:06:02.896
and not being. like.
so angry at everyone

109
00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:04.865
because I was really angry
at everyone.

110
00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:07.668
You talked about how things

111
00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.302
don't feel like
they're getting better

112
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.838
and how you're trying
really hard

113
00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:13.941
and it doesn't seem like
stuff's working.

114
00:06:14.007 --> 00:06:17.277
Are you thinking
about suicide at all?

115
00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:19.747
I used YouthLine
as a resource.

116
00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:22.783
It was kind of my last resort.

117
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.152
I wasn't super into the idea
at first

118
00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.620
and I didn't really
understand. like.

119
00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:28.789
why hotlines would be helpful

120
00:06:28.856 --> 00:06:31.024
and then I did use it.

121
00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:33.193
And it was a lot easier
to open up to somebody

122
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.428
that was my age.

123
00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:35.696
Okay.

124
00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:37.598
It sucks to hear people
who you. like.

125
00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:40.868
so viscerally feel like
we're in the exact same spot

126
00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:42.135
as you were before
because. like.

127
00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:43.671
I remember being in that spot

128
00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.005
and I remember
how much it sucked

129
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.874
and how much I didn't
want to talk to anyone

130
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.743
and how much I. like.
really could not imagine it

131
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.878
getting any better.

132
00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:53.481
[laughs]
Yeah.

133
00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:56.784
It sucks. but sometimes
it's good to let it out.

134
00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:01.121
Do you think that it would be
helpful to try to check in

135
00:07:01.188 --> 00:07:02.923
with either. like.
the treatment people

136
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.858
or that teacher tomorrow

137
00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:08.762
and then we could call you back
after school?

138
00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:12.432
You think
that would be helpful?

139
00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:17.137
Okay.
Give me one second.

140
00:07:18.706 --> 00:07:20.541
When I was 15. 16.

141
00:07:20.608 --> 00:07:24.311
I could not see myself having
a job or going to college

142
00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:27.948
because I just couldn't see
my future that long.

143
00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:31.785
So every time I'd get through
one of those milestones.

144
00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:33.386
that's what I think about

145
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.924
and I think about
how happy I am to be alive

146
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.527
and how grateful I am
that I kept going.

147
00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:42.530
[calm music]

148
00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:49.737

* *

151
00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:20.734
- My name is Hannah.
and I am a high school senior.

152
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:22.703
[car horn honking]

153
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.037
I'm also an extrovert.

154
00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:25.505
Whoo!
- Yeah!

155
00:08:25.573 --> 00:08:27.775
- And I'm the only extrovert

156
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:31.378
in a household of introverts.

157
00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:34.682
I live in Forsyth County.
Georgia.

158
00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:36.717
It's the South.

159
00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:40.220
It is a very interesting...

160
00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:43.791
area. if you get
what I'm saying.

161
00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.960
Growing up. it's always just
been an unspoken rule

162
00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.229
that because of the color
of my skin.

163
00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:51.699
I have to work ten times
as hard

164
00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:55.368
in order to be seen
as half as good.

165
00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:59.873
I grew up to strive
for perfection

166
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.141
quite literally.

167
00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:03.543
I was a competitive gymnast.

168
00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:07.147
I was in the gym
over 30 hours a week.

169
00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:10.550
But the end of seventh grade.
I got really sick

170
00:09:10.618 --> 00:09:13.787
and I started getting
these dizzy spells

171
00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:16.056
and I started fainting.

172
00:09:16.123 --> 00:09:19.226
And because of my fainting.
I was bullied.

173
00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:22.696
I was harassed.
I was sexually threatened.

174
00:09:22.763 --> 00:09:27.500
Freshman year. I was diagnosed
with a chronic illness.

175
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.537
I just felt so hopeless.
I felt useless.

176
00:09:30.604 --> 00:09:32.405
You know.
used to be an athlete.

177
00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:34.574
I was on top of the world.
I was a gymnast!

178
00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:37.210
You know. nothing
could have stopped me.

179
00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:39.613
And I went from being that

180
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.450
to a kid who needed help
just to be able to walk.

181
00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:45.619
It was just...awful.

182
00:09:45.686 --> 00:09:47.888
* *

183
00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:52.926
I didn't want to be seen as
the weak little Black girl.

184
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.430
And not only that. but with
the sexual harassment threats.

185
00:09:57.497 --> 00:09:59.399
I felt terrified.

186
00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.101
You know. what happens
if I pass out

187
00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:03.603
around the wrong person?

188
00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:06.506
So that was when I started
struggling with anxiety

189
00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:08.241
and depression.

190
00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:10.477
I never thought that
it'd get that bad

191
00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:14.214
until I passed out
at school one day. again.

192
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.917
and my mom had to come
to the nurse's office.

193
00:10:16.984 --> 00:10:19.019
And just to see the look
on her face

194
00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:21.221
when I was in the wheelchair

195
00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:24.958
and she had to wheel me out
to her car yet again--

196
00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:26.393
I didn't want to be
her burden.

197
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:30.097
and it just kind of
snowballed from there.

198
00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:32.599
Until one night.

199
00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:35.635
I snuck downstairs
in the middle of the night.

200
00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:39.372
grabbed all of my dad's
medicine...

201
00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:42.810
and my mom. luckily.
she barged into my room

202
00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:46.714
right when I started to
swallow one handful at a time.

203
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.615
And...

204
00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:54.221
just the horror on her face
when she found me will...

205
00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:56.990
forever be burned
into my memory.

206
00:10:57.057 --> 00:10:59.793
* *

207
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.195
Honestly. I don't even think
the thought occurred to her

208
00:11:02.262 --> 00:11:03.831
to take me to a hospital.

209
00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:07.334
You know. I think it all goes
back to that idea of...

210
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.471
weakness in the Black community

211
00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:15.642
and how we don't allow
ourselves to be seen as weak.

212
00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:18.278
But the night
of my suicide attempt.

213
00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:19.880
me and my mom kind of looked
at each other

214
00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:23.450
and we were. like.
"Okay. well...

215
00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:28.088
this--we might...I might need
some help." you know?

216
00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:30.557
We started looking
for Black therapists

217
00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:33.226
so that I have someone
that I could relate to

218
00:11:33.293 --> 00:11:37.030
on...on lots and lots
of bases.

219
00:11:37.097 --> 00:11:40.868
I love therapy.
I'm in therapy religiously.

220
00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:42.903
It's helped me be okay
with myself

221
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.671
and learn to love myself.

222
00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:48.341
* *

223
00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:50.610
I started messaging myself

224
00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:53.646
things to motivate me
throughout the day.

225
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.850
And that's when my brother
and I had the idea

226
00:11:56.917 --> 00:11:58.451
for the "Not OK" app--

227
00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:00.287
basically.
a digital panic button

228
00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:01.688
that sends an alert
with a message

229
00:12:01.755 --> 00:12:04.892
that says "Hey. it's me.
and I'm not OK."

230
00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.661
I--honestly. I love creating
and I love solving problems

231
00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:15.168
and I love sending those
solutions out into the world.

232
00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.204
- * Ooh *

233
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:23.176
- * I *

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:29.883
* I am light.
I am light *

235
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.319
- Now. I am my definition

236
00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:34.587
of "Black Girl Magic."
you know?

237
00:12:34.654 --> 00:12:35.923
I love myself.

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:38.225
I'm wearing my natural hair.
you know?

239
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:41.461
I don't care what anyone else
thinks besides me

240
00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:43.797
because I know that I'm magic.

241
00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:45.833
I know how powerful I am.

242
00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:48.035
I know that I'm strong...

243
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.603
even though I can be
vulnerable.

244
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.842

- Janis. sitting up here
in New York.

247
00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:05.052
Never expected
to be studying suicide

248
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:06.653
and self-injury at all.
honestly.

249
00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:09.823
but I tend to like things
that make other people nervous.

250
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.224
I like--I like the things

251
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.960
that are on our--
in our social edge

252
00:13:13.026 --> 00:13:16.129
because I think that's where
the greatest authenticity is.

253
00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:17.364
sort of the place
where humans

254
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.132
are in some ways
the most human.

255
00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:20.567
Your journeys
have been really hard-won.

256
00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.702
This is hard-won wisdom. right?

257
00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:25.438
So when you look back

258
00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:26.907
and when you look
at the situations

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.375

in getting help
or receiving help?

262
00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:37.617
- My maybe biggest barrier
to getting help

263
00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:39.519
is that for. like.
a really long time.

264
00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:41.821
I didn't want help.
You know?

265
00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:45.058
And I was so used to. like...

266
00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:46.960
dealing with it on my own.

267
00:13:47.027 --> 00:13:51.364
And I was so deeply

268
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:52.665
kind of stuck
in my own head

269
00:13:52.732 --> 00:13:55.102
and that even though
it was so bad.

270
00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.070
it was also kind of comfortable

271
00:13:57.137 --> 00:14:00.507
because I had been there
for so long

272
00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:03.076
and I didn't necessarily
want to get better.

273
00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:05.712
- Yeah.
I'll pitch in next.

274
00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:08.916
I'd started off fighting

that I was offered.

276
00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:11.952
I'd go to counselors
and I wouldn't be able

277
00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:13.987
to speak with them 'cause
I would just constantly

278
00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:15.622
try to outsmart them.

- I...

280
00:14:17.424 --> 00:14:21.294
I grew up very perfectionistic.

281
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:26.466
and I had a lot of internalized
transphobia

282
00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:31.038
that was made worse
by my perfectionism

283
00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:37.577
because I felt like being trans
wasn't being perfect.

284
00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:39.512

and within the South Asian
community.

288
00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:48.989
mental health
is incredibly stigmatized.

289
00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:51.992
Like. it's incredibly
stigmatized everywhere.

290
00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.861
but specifically within
immigrant communities

291
00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:57.264
is beyond stigmatized.

292
00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.598
- When my family and I.

293
00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:00.567
we were going
through family therapy.

294
00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:03.303
we still had a lot to work on.
you know?

295
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.940
I was in a much better place.
but I was still in a dark place

296
00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:09.876
and I was trying to be honest
and open with my family.

297
00:15:09.943 --> 00:15:12.779
But we had to work really.
really hard

298
00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:16.249
to break out of those stigmas
that were beat into our head

299
00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:18.018
from such a young age.
you know?

300
00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:19.186
- I think for me
being a member

301
00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.387
of the Latinx community.

302
00:15:20.453 --> 00:15:22.622
just culturally. you know.

303
00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:24.524
the way I was raised in that
community as a male

304
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:28.328
regarding help-seeking.
regarding mental health issues

305
00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:30.697
and the diagnosis
that I had at that time.

306
00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.632
overcoming that.
the stigma--

307
00:15:32.699 --> 00:15:35.535
that was a pretty significant
barrier.

308
00:15:36.469 --> 00:15:37.437
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

309
00:15:37.504 --> 00:15:38.638
I think you hit it on the head.

310
00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:40.940
We kind of keep it to
ourselves.

311
00:15:41.008 --> 00:15:44.077
and we're not able to have
conversations about it

312
00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:45.512
and bring light to it

313
00:15:45.578 --> 00:15:48.248
and actually empathize
with each other

314
00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:50.450
because we think
it's just this rare thing

315
00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:54.621
that happens to a select few.
but it really isn't.

In the Latin culture
particularly.

335
00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:58.951
there is a stigma against--

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:47.734
and these really intense
racing thoughts.

352
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.369
What I describe racing thoughts

353
00:17:49.436 --> 00:17:50.703
for people that don't know.
it's like...

354
00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.071
it's never positive things.

355
00:17:52.139 --> 00:17:53.473
It was never. like.

356
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.807
"Oh. I feel great.
I can't wait to go to school.

357
00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:55.808
"I can't wait to go hang out
with my friends

358
00:17:55.875 --> 00:17:57.076
"and ask questions at school.

359
00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:58.378
talk to my teachers
and all that stuff."

360
00:17:58.445 --> 00:17:59.612
Like. it was never anything
like that.

361
00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:01.181
It's always negative thoughts.
like.

362
00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:02.549
"Oh. like. why'd you do that?
That was so stupid.

363
00:18:02.615 --> 00:18:03.950
"Like. don't do that.
Why'd you say that?

364
00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:06.686
"Don't--why'd you--don't go
to class. don't do this.

365
00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:08.388
you can't do that. don't even
try. you're gonna mess up."

00:18:08.455 --> 00:18:12.659
Like. it's that racing. just
exhausting dialogue in my head.

367
00:18:14.994 --> 00:18:19.098
Come sophomore year. my mental
state was just really fragile.

368
00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:20.900
And by my senior year.

369
00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:23.303
I started to feel this. like.

went to Ivy League schools.

done since they've been here.

381
00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:47.494
I just didn't want to be here
anymore.

I remember thinking to myself.
"It's too late.

388
00:19:05.612 --> 00:19:08.581
They can't stop me.
This is over."

389

and seeing this state trooper

390
00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:15.555
out of his car. gun drawn.

391
00:19:15.622 --> 00:19:17.324

to him. like.

"Please. just shoot."

393
00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.460
Like. "There's nothing
you can do.

00:19:20.527 --> 00:19:22.629
You can't save me."

395
00:19:22.695 --> 00:19:24.364
He kind of saw
that I was in distress

396
00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:26.733
and. fortunately. was able
to subdue me away from traffic

397
00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:30.169
and I blacked out.

398
00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:34.907
I woke up handcuffed
to my hospital bed.

I was admitted into
a day treatment program.

"I don't think I can
amount to anything.

402

[birds chirping]

404
00:19:45.952 --> 00:19:48.255
I had two or three friends
that would write me letters

405
00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:49.656
and check in on me.

406
00:19:49.722 --> 00:19:51.924
I had the support
from most of my family

even though. you know.
a lot of them

408
00:19:53.426 --> 00:19:54.661
couldn't really understand
or relate

00:19:54.727 --> 00:19:56.429
to what I was going through.

410
00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:57.697

00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:03.370
Like. I've been my own worst
enemy in so many ways.

413
00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:05.705
But if there's anybody
that can look me in the eye

414
00:20:05.772 --> 00:20:07.640
or write me these letters
and tell me they care about me

[birds chirping]

419
00:20:18.084 --> 00:20:19.552
I remember
going to my therapist.

420

this old white dude with.
like. a curly mustache

and being. like.

"I'm so pumped.
I can't wait to get out.

"I'm gonna graduate
high school.

I'm gonna get out of here.
I'm gonna. like. go do things."

426
00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:34.367
And. like. I was genuinely
excited and motivated

427
00:20:34.434 --> 00:20:35.535
and he kind of
just looked at me

428
00:20:35.602 --> 00:20:36.836
and he. like.
rocked in his chair

429
00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:37.870
and he. like.

00:20:51.183 --> 00:20:54.186
So I went back home

and started to kind of just
change things up.

439
00:20:57.156 --> 00:20:58.925
I started working
at a health club

440
00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:01.193

about having a healthy body

441
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.796

you can possibly do

is do some distracting

as much as possible

older influences

518

definitely not healthy for me.

00:25:22.922 --> 00:25:24.824
by these older men.

525
00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:26.726
I didn't tell anyone about it.

526
00:25:26.793 --> 00:25:31.197
and then when I was 16.
I had an experience as well.

527
00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:35.835
And I didn't know it was...

528
00:25:35.902 --> 00:25:37.269
it just seemed normal.

529
00:25:37.336 --> 00:25:41.674
and I felt like
it was my fault. and...

530
00:25:41.741 --> 00:25:43.610
I think I could see now. like.

531
00:25:43.676 --> 00:25:46.746
all the things that played into
me wanting to not be here.

532
00:25:46.813 --> 00:25:49.582
but that's when I started.
like...

533
00:25:49.649 --> 00:25:53.319
hating life and then my
self-harm got. like. crazy.

534
00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:55.421
* *

535
00:25:55.487 --> 00:25:59.826
And at this point. like.
I was very suicidal.

536
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:05.164
And I had different attempts
along the way.

537
00:26:05.231 --> 00:26:08.768
I've been in a psych ward
maybe four or five times.

538
00:26:08.835 --> 00:26:10.670
I would. like.
wake up in the hospital.

539
00:26:10.737 --> 00:26:13.005
I'm like.
"Fuck. I'm still here."

540
00:26:13.072 --> 00:26:19.011
* *

541
00:26:19.078 --> 00:26:22.248
I needed something
different...

542
00:26:22.314 --> 00:26:25.551
and I left California.

543
00:26:27.987 --> 00:26:29.922
Moving here with my aunt
and my uncle

544
00:26:29.989 --> 00:26:31.958
and then their two boys...

545
00:26:33.059 --> 00:26:34.827
That changed my life.

546
00:26:34.894 --> 00:26:36.262
[laughs]
Okay.

547
00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:37.864
Dear God.
thank you for this food.

548
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.433
and I pray that you help us
to just be lights in this world

549
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.769
and honor you.

550
00:26:42.835 --> 00:26:44.971
In Jesus' name. Amen.
- Amen.

551
00:26:46.405 --> 00:26:48.474
- I immediately got
a customer service job

552
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.476
which is my favorite
kind of job

553
00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:52.444
'cause I get to interact
with people.

554
00:26:52.511 --> 00:26:57.049
and I started to meet people
here in Colorado.

555
00:26:57.116 --> 00:26:58.651
Like all week.
all I was eating was...

556
00:26:58.718 --> 00:27:00.787
As soon as I moved here.
I got a therapist. though.

557
00:27:00.853 --> 00:27:03.022
just because I'm like.
"Next time I get triggered.

558
00:27:03.089 --> 00:27:05.324
"I'm not--I'm not gonna go
off the deep end

559
00:27:05.391 --> 00:27:09.796
and try to wreck my life
and not care."

560
00:27:09.862 --> 00:27:11.698
I'm not gonna lie.

561
00:27:11.764 --> 00:27:15.735
I'm not sure what keeps me
here all the time.

562
00:27:15.802 --> 00:27:19.071
My friends. my dog.

563
00:27:19.138 --> 00:27:21.573
I'm still figuring it out.

564
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.543
[soft music]

565
00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.479
* *

566
00:27:27.546 --> 00:27:28.881
- Uh. can I write?

567
00:27:28.948 --> 00:27:30.216
- You can write. yeah.

568
00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:32.685
- Is that. like.
a quality shot?

569
00:27:32.752 --> 00:27:36.222
- Yeah. yeah.
[laughter]

570
00:27:36.288 --> 00:27:40.860
[mid-tempo music]

571
00:27:40.927 --> 00:27:43.629
- Well. my name is.
officially. as of last week.

572
00:27:43.696 --> 00:27:45.431
Quinn Marcroft.

573
00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:48.801
I've got that nice little "F"
on my driver's license now.

574
00:27:48.868 --> 00:27:51.037
So. yeah.

575
00:27:51.103 --> 00:27:53.339
So this is my little
pine bed here.

576
00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:56.743
and it's a good place
to sit and read.

577
00:27:56.809 --> 00:27:59.311
I just added some new needles.

578
00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:03.415
I recently moved to
Portland. Oregon.

579
00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:05.651
This is the first time
in my life

580
00:28:05.718 --> 00:28:08.554
that I've been able
to live on my own.

581
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.357
[whistling]

582
00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:13.625
I mostly grew up
in St. George. Utah.

583
00:28:14.927 --> 00:28:18.197
And I was kind of raised
to love nature

584
00:28:18.264 --> 00:28:22.268
and that's always been
something that I...

585
00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:25.371
go to when I'm having
a hard time.

586
00:28:26.973 --> 00:28:29.341
Because
if I don't force myself

587
00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:31.410
to do things that I enjoy.

588
00:28:31.477 --> 00:28:34.280
then I forget
that I enjoy things.

589
00:28:36.315 --> 00:28:38.684
I've been diagnosed with

590
00:28:38.751 --> 00:28:45.191
borderline personality
disorder. anxiety disorder.

591
00:28:45.257 --> 00:28:48.227
bipolar disorder once. um.

592
00:28:48.294 --> 00:28:50.062
and I think the one

593
00:28:50.129 --> 00:28:53.699
that most of the people that
know me have kind of settled on

594
00:28:53.766 --> 00:28:57.069
is the treatment-resistant
depression.

595
00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:04.510
When I was like
four or five.

596
00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:11.383
I would always pretend. like.
in secret. to be a woman.

597
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.186
And I would hide it.

598
00:29:14.253 --> 00:29:17.723
I knew that being a gender

599
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.592
that you weren't assigned

600
00:29:20.659 --> 00:29:23.262
is not something
that's looked upon as good.

601
00:29:23.329 --> 00:29:25.331
at least in Utah...right?

602
00:29:25.397 --> 00:29:27.800
Or. at least
in the LDS culture.

603
00:29:27.867 --> 00:29:30.336
And LDS is "Latter Day Saints."

604
00:29:30.402 --> 00:29:33.139
It's Mormon. for those of you
who don't know.

605
00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:38.978
The winter of my junior
year in high school.

606
00:29:39.045 --> 00:29:40.646
I came out to my parents.

607
00:29:42.381 --> 00:29:46.018
And my parents
weren't thrilled.

608
00:29:46.085 --> 00:29:49.088
but they were always...

609
00:29:49.155 --> 00:29:51.457
always supportive of me.

610
00:29:52.491 --> 00:29:56.863
I started hormones in 2016.

611
00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:01.500
But I didn't want to be out
as trans in high school.

612
00:30:03.369 --> 00:30:05.938
I wore a dress to graduation

613
00:30:06.005 --> 00:30:08.674
under my cap and gown.

614
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.577
and it was a really cute way
to come out to the public.

615
00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:15.314
but I'm a trans woman in
a very Conservative society.

616
00:30:15.381 --> 00:30:18.284
Basically an outcast.

617
00:30:20.286 --> 00:30:23.722
After that.
things kind of went to shit.

618
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:26.692
[soft music]

619
00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:31.563
My suicidal ideation
was off the charts.

620
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:36.668
I don't think that I ever
really wanted to leave.

621
00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:38.204
* *

622
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.840
I just know that I wanted
to be out of the pain.

623
00:30:41.908 --> 00:30:45.744
I have been forcing myself
to not spend more than an hour

624
00:30:45.811 --> 00:30:47.980
on my phone a day.

625
00:30:48.047 --> 00:30:51.383
I read. I write.
I go on a walk.

626
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.652
I listen to music that I like.

627
00:30:53.719 --> 00:30:56.555
and I do all of these
different things.

628
00:30:56.622 --> 00:30:59.291
and that builds
my life worth living.

629
00:31:00.092 --> 00:31:03.029

630
00:31:03.095 --> 00:31:10.202

633
00:31:41.968 --> 00:31:43.169
- My name is Saniya.

634
00:31:43.235 --> 00:31:45.771
I live in San Jose. California.

635
00:31:45.837 --> 00:31:49.808
and I go to school at Drexel
University in Philadelphia.

636
00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:56.882
Coming from
a South Asian background

637
00:31:56.949 --> 00:31:58.384
of a collectivist culture

638
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:02.788
where being an individual
is selfish.

639
00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:06.892
that plays a huge role in how
you interact with mental health

640
00:32:06.959 --> 00:32:08.194
and even self-care.

641
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.829
[water splashes]

642
00:32:19.371 --> 00:32:23.075
From a very young age. I knew
that my parents had problems.

643
00:32:23.142 --> 00:32:27.446
The earliest I can remember
my dad being abusive

644
00:32:27.513 --> 00:32:30.216
is probably about four.

645
00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:32.784
They had gotten into a fight.

646
00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:36.388
and I remember hearing
something fall down the stairs

647
00:32:36.455 --> 00:32:41.393
and I remember
just instantly thinking

648
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.895
that was my mom.

649
00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:47.666
* *

650
00:32:47.733 --> 00:32:52.938
But there was this unsaid.
unspoken rule of

651
00:32:53.005 --> 00:32:54.173
things are kept quiet.

652
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.343
What happens in the home
stays in the home.

653
00:32:57.409 --> 00:33:01.547
As time went on.
the abuse was more often.

654
00:33:01.613 --> 00:33:04.250
I was seeing it a lot more.

655
00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:08.354
I felt utterly alone.

656
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.855
Beginning of sophomore year.

657
00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:11.823
my parents
finally got separated.

658
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:14.426
Moved in with my mom
full-time.

659
00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:16.395
At school.
I couldn't concentrate.

660
00:33:16.462 --> 00:33:18.497
My grades fell drastically.

661
00:33:18.564 --> 00:33:21.533
I couldn't get up
in the mornings.

662
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:26.905
I went to the school counselor
and I told her...

663
00:33:26.972 --> 00:33:28.474
"Hi." like...

664
00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:33.112
"I'm. you know...
I'm suicidal." and...

665
00:33:33.179 --> 00:33:36.182
she said. "But are you really?"

666
00:33:36.248 --> 00:33:42.421
And it was March 15th of 2015

667
00:33:42.488 --> 00:33:46.092
and I--my mom wasn't home.

668
00:33:46.158 --> 00:33:48.026
My sister was with my dad.

669
00:33:48.094 --> 00:33:50.462
And I was just. like.
"You know what?

670
00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:53.932
I'm tired.
I'm gonna do it."

671
00:33:53.999 --> 00:33:55.534
* *

672
00:33:55.601 --> 00:33:59.338
I had written a note
on my Facebook wall

673
00:33:59.405 --> 00:34:03.309
saying sorry for being a burden

674
00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:06.312
to my friends and my family.

675
00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:08.214
My best friend saw the post.

676
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.449
She called me and she was
like. "I'm coming over."

677
00:34:10.516 --> 00:34:11.883
And I was like.
"Please don't."

678
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:14.686
And she was like.
"No. I'm coming over."

679
00:34:14.753 --> 00:34:18.790
Drove over
and just kind of held me.

680
00:34:18.857 --> 00:34:23.362
I really appreciate
that she convinced me

681
00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:24.963
to tell my mom.

682
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.965
because I don't think
I would have

683
00:34:27.032 --> 00:34:30.369
if she didn't stay with me
until my mom came home.

684
00:34:30.436 --> 00:34:33.004
* *

685
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:34.506
And I told my mom.

686
00:34:34.573 --> 00:34:38.144
"So. I tried to kill
myself today.

687
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.412
I need to go to the hospital."

688
00:34:40.479 --> 00:34:42.047
* *

689
00:34:42.114 --> 00:34:45.050
My mom had to really shift
her own mentality

690
00:34:45.117 --> 00:34:48.420
because of the world
she grew up in.

691
00:34:50.422 --> 00:34:53.192
She visited me every day
at the hospital.

692
00:34:53.259 --> 00:34:55.361
as well when I was transferred
to the psych ward.

693
00:34:55.427 --> 00:34:58.830
She took me to my therapy
appointments.

694
00:34:58.897 --> 00:35:01.900
She went to the group meetings
with other parents

695
00:35:01.967 --> 00:35:04.002
to learn about
what was going on.

696
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:06.638
to make sure
I took my medication.

697
00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.677
Mental health is a huge taboo
in the South Asian community

698
00:35:11.743 --> 00:35:13.879
and the Asian American

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:17.449

00:35:29.094 --> 00:35:30.329

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:39.371
As you know. our podcast
is focused on

708
00:35:39.438 --> 00:35:42.474
exploring taboo.
stigmatized topics

709
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:46.278
that our South Asian parents
don't explore.

My entire
mental health journey.

which is. you know.
still going on.

715
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:02.794
has really informed what I
want to do in the future.

716
00:36:02.861 --> 00:36:06.765
because I've had so many people
come and ask me. you know.

717
00:36:06.832 --> 00:36:09.768
"I'm looking for a therapist
that looks like me."

718
00:36:09.835 --> 00:36:12.804
And. like. I completely
understand that.

719
00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:15.741
I mean. that's the--
the driving force

720
00:36:15.807 --> 00:36:19.211
behind why I want
to become a psychologist.

721
00:36:19.278 --> 00:36:22.214

723
00:36:30.322 --> 00:36:33.024
- What were the turning points
in your journey?

724
00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:35.494
What--I mean. all of you
got to the precipice

725
00:36:35.561 --> 00:36:37.796
where you considered
not living.

726
00:36:37.863 --> 00:36:41.367
What--why did you decide
to live and to stay?

727
00:36:41.433 --> 00:36:45.437
- Yeah. I got sober after
performing on a cruise ship.

728
00:36:45.504 --> 00:36:46.738
[chuckles]
For four months.

729
00:36:46.805 --> 00:36:49.808
So you can imagine
that that was kind of

730
00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:51.377
what I was doing a lot of.

731
00:36:51.443 --> 00:36:55.714
When I quit drinking was really
when my life turned around

732
00:36:55.781 --> 00:37:00.118
and I became less suicidal
when I stopped drinking.

733
00:37:00.185 --> 00:37:02.588
- I guess the medicine

734
00:37:02.654 --> 00:37:04.656
is pretty much the biggest
thing out of all of it.

735
00:37:04.723 --> 00:37:06.692
I've struggled
with a lot of addictions

736
00:37:06.758 --> 00:37:09.661
in which I don't trust myself
with certain medications.

737
00:37:09.728 --> 00:37:13.131
so it took a long time...
[laughs]

738
00:37:13.198 --> 00:37:15.200
it took a really long time.
but.

739
00:37:15.267 --> 00:37:17.336
I consulted
with a psychiatrist

740
00:37:17.403 --> 00:37:19.938
over taking
an anti-anxiety medication

741
00:37:20.005 --> 00:37:22.974
and I've definitely turned
around where I need to be.

742
00:37:23.041 --> 00:37:25.176
- The first time
I ever went to the hospital

743
00:37:25.243 --> 00:37:28.113
for. like. psychiatric care

744
00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:30.181
was the result
of a suicide attempt

745
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:34.286
and so I was definitely
sure that. you know.

746
00:37:34.353 --> 00:37:35.487
that that was bad enough.

747
00:37:35.554 --> 00:37:37.723
that that could be
my turning point.

748
00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:41.059
That was only
the beginning of it.

749
00:37:41.126 --> 00:37:44.363
And I hated therapy and I
absolutely did not want to go.

750
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.399
I realized that. like.
this isn't gonna work

751
00:37:47.466 --> 00:37:49.535
if I don't think
it's going to work.

752
00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:51.202
- I think maybe we--
- I think--

753
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:52.638
Go ahead.
- Yeah.

754
00:37:52.704 --> 00:37:54.873
Okay. so I think it got
really dark for me.

755
00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.876
but I had no idea
that it was depression.

756
00:37:57.943 --> 00:37:59.911
and I ended up
going to counseling

757
00:37:59.978 --> 00:38:03.982
after a bunch of resistance
initially to counseling.

758
00:38:04.049 --> 00:38:08.487
I ended up finally going
and speaking to a psychiatrist.

759
00:38:08.554 --> 00:38:10.722
And so the turning point
was really just

760
00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:13.625
really being sick and tired
of where I was

761
00:38:13.692 --> 00:38:16.261
and willing to try anything

762
00:38:16.328 --> 00:38:18.564
to get myself
to a better position.

763
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.931
- Kind of like
Abraham's saying.

764
00:38:19.998 --> 00:38:22.568
I also didn't know what it was.

765
00:38:22.634 --> 00:38:24.936
I just knew
I wanted to die constantly.

766
00:38:25.003 --> 00:38:28.306
like. every day.
and there was no way out.

767
00:38:28.374 --> 00:38:31.009
And so it finally took

768
00:38:31.076 --> 00:38:34.513
kind of my life falling
into a complete dark hole

769
00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.916
for me to kind of look for
a lot of professional help.

770
00:38:37.983 --> 00:38:40.786
And so kind of
realizing I'm human.

771
00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:42.087
and that doesn't make me weak.

772
00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:43.955
It actually--
it's a strong thing

773
00:38:44.022 --> 00:38:45.657
to admit that you're hurting.

774
00:38:45.724 --> 00:38:48.126
- I think the people in this
room...can we call it a room?

775
00:38:48.193 --> 00:38:49.795
The people in this room?
- Sure.

776
00:38:49.861 --> 00:38:51.830
- For sure. like. I mean...

777
00:38:51.897 --> 00:38:54.265
we were able to get through
what we got through.

778
00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:58.470
We are continuing to battle.
like. day-to-day challenges

779
00:38:58.537 --> 00:39:00.038
and I think that
the ability that we have

780
00:39:00.105 --> 00:39:03.041
to connect in this way.
I think. is...

781
00:39:03.108 --> 00:39:05.844
it inspires me and gives me
hope for the future.

782
00:39:17.756 --> 00:39:19.925
- Um...

783
00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:23.729
so. I'll go with this one here.

784
00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:26.765
This one I wrote
is. like. how I think.

785
00:39:26.832 --> 00:39:29.635
It's just a rush of thoughts.

786
00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:31.136
"I'm running from paranoia.

787
00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:32.571
"I think that
I'm being tortured

788
00:39:32.638 --> 00:39:34.640

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:36.007

of my whole life.

793
00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:46.585
The first verse is kind of
me running from myself.

794
00:39:46.652 --> 00:39:49.621
I have a ton of demons.
and...

795
00:39:49.688 --> 00:39:53.191
I don't think the suicidal
thoughts will ever go away.

of clear grasp

of who I might be.

been amazing people.

at all what they expected.

I'm going through.

in denial about stuff.

814
00:40:52.751 --> 00:40:54.019
I guess I was bouncy.

815
00:40:54.085 --> 00:40:55.220
I was kind of
an off-the-walls kid.

816
00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.656
I always had a lot of energy.

817
00:40:57.723 --> 00:40:59.525
I grew up in Utah.

818
00:40:59.591 --> 00:41:03.194
and it was a very interesting
experience. to say the least.

819
00:41:03.261 --> 00:41:07.232
but then I moved to
Colorado...

820
00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:10.936
and that was something
completely different.

821
00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:15.373
When I transferred schools.
I lost all of my friends.

822
00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:20.045
It started off with bullying
and just not being accepted.

823
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:22.447
I would change myself
on a daily basis.

824
00:41:22.514 --> 00:41:23.982
Change up my clothes.

who would just
finally accept me.

828
00:41:31.156 --> 00:41:32.457
And I know
if I could have dropped

829
00:41:32.524 --> 00:41:35.326
wanting to be everyone else
instead of myself.

830
00:41:35.393 --> 00:41:36.795
I wouldn't have--I wouldn't
have fallen

831
00:41:36.862 --> 00:41:38.229
into a loop of drugs.

00:41:38.296 --> 00:41:41.700

into a cycle of depression.

I wouldn't have fallen
into anything.

I'm sure I would have had
my problems. but...

835
00:41:47.472 --> 00:41:52.043
it wouldn't have been the same
at all. by any means.

836
00:41:54.045 --> 00:41:55.413
The first real moment
where I was like.

837
00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.049
"Yeah. I think
I want it to be over."

838
00:41:58.116 --> 00:42:00.886
was probably. like.
eighth grade.

I felt like...

841
00:42:05.323 --> 00:42:08.193
I didn't have a real purpose.

842
00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:11.162
And I know I look back at it
and I'm. like.

843

"I was in eighth grade.
how could I possibly

844
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:15.233
determine my purpose
in eighth grade?"

845
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.569
But. I mean. it's how I felt.

It's just a way
to feel those feelings.

852
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.422
I can say to myself
sometimes.

853
00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:39.057
"It's okay to feel it."

854
00:42:39.124 --> 00:42:41.492
I think tucking it away...

855
00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.595
it's inevitable
to come back around.

Let yourself cry.

the feelings you're feeling.

873
00:43:59.537 --> 00:44:02.507
was from the outside world--
it was not from my family.

874
00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:04.676
I was often told
that my interests

875
00:44:04.743 --> 00:44:08.714
were for boys and stuff
by teachers and other parents.

876
00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.581
Growing up in the '90s.

877
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:12.483
you know. there wasn't really
anybody on TV

878
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:14.853
that I thought.
"Gosh. you know what?

879
00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.755
I think I'm kind of like them."

880
00:44:16.822 --> 00:44:18.824
You know. there was no
lifeguard at the pool

881
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:20.425
where I was like.

882
00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:24.095
"Oh. my gosh. that's a cool
lesbian and I want her hair."

883
00:44:24.162 --> 00:44:26.865
You know?
There was nothing there for me.

884
00:44:26.932 --> 00:44:30.468
so that's where I became
really goofy.

885
00:44:30.535 --> 00:44:33.204
If I could make people laugh.
they wouldn't make fun of me

886
00:44:33.271 --> 00:44:35.340
or think I was weird.

887
00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:36.975
I wasn't out or didn't know

888
00:44:37.042 --> 00:44:39.310
that really
I was queer at all.

889
00:44:39.377 --> 00:44:41.346
but I was...
I was weird.

890
00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.615
Crap. I don't know
when it turns on.

891
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:48.386
And then when
I was about ten.

892
00:44:48.453 --> 00:44:51.656
depression hit pretty hard.

893
00:44:51.723 --> 00:44:55.927
A cousin of mine
passed away kind of abruptly

894
00:44:55.994 --> 00:44:57.295
and she was 17.

895
00:44:57.362 --> 00:45:01.366
And from then on.
I thought about suicide a lot

896
00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:03.368
and dying young.

897
00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:07.338
And a year--almost probably
a year after that

898
00:45:07.405 --> 00:45:10.141
was my first suicide attempt.

899
00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:12.177
It was no written plan
or anything.

900
00:45:12.243 --> 00:45:15.013
but I remember the feeling
growing. you know.

901
00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:19.584
and I was outside
actually playing tag

902
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.686
with some neighborhood
kids at night

903
00:45:21.753 --> 00:45:23.554
and I remember sitting
in the driveway

904
00:45:23.621 --> 00:45:25.523
and watching these other teens.
you know.

905
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.960
young teens interact
and thinking...

906
00:45:29.027 --> 00:45:30.695
"Oh. God.
I hate this."

907
00:45:30.762 --> 00:45:32.730
[laughs]
Um...

908
00:45:32.798 --> 00:45:34.833
"I don't know who I am.

909
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.269
"I don't know why I feel bad.
but...you know what?

910
00:45:38.336 --> 00:45:41.172
It's--I'd like it to stop."

911
00:45:41.239 --> 00:45:43.975
That's when I just
decided to overdose.

912
00:45:44.042 --> 00:45:46.244
* *

913
00:45:46.311 --> 00:45:48.213
I had my stomach pumped

914
00:45:48.279 --> 00:45:50.115
which. in and of itself.
I gotta say

915
00:45:50.181 --> 00:45:51.850
was a pretty traumatic
experience.

916
00:45:51.917 --> 00:45:55.553
I remember being
kind of flustered.

917
00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:58.023
Not necessarily happy
that I was alive

918
00:45:58.089 --> 00:45:59.524
because I felt the same.

919
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:03.128
but I was happy that I was
talking to people about it.

920
00:46:03.194 --> 00:46:04.863
That was a huge relief.

921
00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:07.198
And then there were family
members that were mad at me

922
00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:09.234
because...you know.

923
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.769
"How dare you cause this pain

924
00:46:11.837 --> 00:46:15.406
on your family that's so
tight-knit." you know?

925
00:46:15.473 --> 00:46:17.475
So I felt ashamed. too.

926
00:46:17.542 --> 00:46:21.046
I felt...
I felt selfish.

927
00:46:22.147 --> 00:46:25.951
And I still--I still kind of
do when I have these thoughts.

928
00:46:26.017 --> 00:46:29.554
* *

929
00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:33.191
I went into some regular
therapy. which was great.

930
00:46:33.258 --> 00:46:34.425
But it took a minute.
of course.

931
00:46:34.492 --> 00:46:37.428
to find some good therapists.

932
00:46:37.495 --> 00:46:41.332
I was on medication
that did help. but...

933
00:46:41.399 --> 00:46:46.437
therapy and doing a lot of
work around my gender identity

934
00:46:46.504 --> 00:46:49.207
that wasn't really addressed...

935
00:46:49.274 --> 00:46:51.977
that needed to happen.
and it didn't.

936
00:46:52.043 --> 00:46:54.946
* *

937
00:46:55.013 --> 00:46:58.984
I was still very confused.
and I tried to fit in

938
00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:02.787
and trying to act like
other girls in high school.

939
00:47:02.854 --> 00:47:06.157
I was grasping for something
for a long time.

940
00:47:07.926 --> 00:47:10.929
- Are you a late-in-life gay
or an early-in-life gay?

941
00:47:10.996 --> 00:47:12.397
- Are you a baby dyke?

942
00:47:12.463 --> 00:47:13.731
- Are you trying to make up
for all the times

943
00:47:13.798 --> 00:47:15.533
you said. "That's so gay"
in high school?

944
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.603
- After ten years.
I was performing a lot.

945
00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:21.306
Did comedy at night.
I was drinking every night.

946
00:47:21.372 --> 00:47:23.508
Being on antidepressants
and drinking

947
00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:28.079
is just not a good idea.
I did not react well to it.

948
00:47:28.146 --> 00:47:32.884
I had some career upsets and
not feeling good about myself.

949
00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:35.386
I was kind of getting
to that same headspace

950
00:47:35.453 --> 00:47:37.956
where I was 13 again.

951
00:47:38.023 --> 00:47:39.490
My thoughts were very dark.

952
00:47:39.557 --> 00:47:42.027
I thought about death a lot.

953
00:47:42.093 --> 00:47:43.428
You know. that suicide ideality

954
00:47:43.494 --> 00:47:45.830
kind of slipping back
into my brain.

955
00:47:45.897 --> 00:47:49.968
It was--it was so bad
that I thought again...

956
00:47:50.035 --> 00:47:51.569
"I might just do this."

957
00:47:51.636 --> 00:47:53.972
But. you know.
that little part of me

958
00:47:54.039 --> 00:47:56.341
where my parents really...

959
00:47:56.407 --> 00:47:59.277
you know.
were in the back of my head

960
00:47:59.344 --> 00:48:00.845
with how much. you know.
they've loved me

961
00:48:00.912 --> 00:48:02.147
throughout the years.

962
00:48:02.213 --> 00:48:04.449
I called my mom and said.
"Something's not..."

963
00:48:04.515 --> 00:48:06.251
You know.
"Something's not right.

964
00:48:06.317 --> 00:48:09.020
I don't want to be alive."

965
00:48:09.087 --> 00:48:10.821
She said.
"You need to come home."

966
00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:12.023
I wanted help.

967
00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:14.325
I wanted a professional's help.
too.

968
00:48:14.392 --> 00:48:17.929
* *

969
00:48:17.996 --> 00:48:20.331
Being in a mental health
facility actually taught me

970
00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:22.533
that in these
really dark places.

971
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.671
when you think that you'd be
better off not here...

972
00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:29.807
the thoughts that are coming
into your head right now

973
00:48:29.874 --> 00:48:32.443
are...

974
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:34.279
because of certain chemicals
in your brain.

975
00:48:34.345 --> 00:48:35.947
They're false.

976
00:48:36.014 --> 00:48:38.183
Because you're sick.

977
00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:41.419
We have places in peoples'
lives that we...

978
00:48:41.486 --> 00:48:45.223
we don't realize we fill.

979
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:47.225
And it...

980
00:48:47.292 --> 00:48:49.827
it's just not the answer
for us to disappear.

981
00:48:51.196 --> 00:48:54.099
[soft music]

982
00:48:54.165 --> 00:49:01.306
* *

983
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.193
[lighthearted music]

984
00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:29.400
* *

985
00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:33.904
- I live in Pensacola.
Florida currently.

986
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:35.573
* *

987
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.075
I'm a middle school teacher.

988
00:49:37.142 --> 00:49:40.345
It's a very rewarding job
and I love my students.

989
00:49:40.411 --> 00:49:43.581
* *

990
00:49:43.648 --> 00:49:44.415
[laughs]

991
00:49:44.482 --> 00:49:45.916
* *

992
00:49:45.983 --> 00:49:49.654
I was the first in my family
to attend college.

993
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.722
Both of my parents
are immigrants from Jamaica

994
00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:55.660
and they came to America
to pursue the American Dream.

995
00:49:57.462 --> 00:49:59.030
Growing up. I had this image

996
00:49:59.097 --> 00:50:02.433
of what college was supposed
to be like.

997
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.303
But when I finally got there.
it was...

998
00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:08.239
[laughs]
it didn't go as planned.

999
00:50:08.306 --> 00:50:10.708
I didn't think
about the challenges

1000
00:50:10.775 --> 00:50:13.111
that could come
from transitioning

1001
00:50:13.178 --> 00:50:14.879
from high school to college.

1002
00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:17.548
For the first time.
I had to pay bills

1003
00:50:17.615 --> 00:50:19.484
like rent and groceries

1004
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:22.520
and so I kind of had
to grow up really fast.

1005
00:50:22.587 --> 00:50:26.791
I was working a full-time job
and also a full-time student.

1006
00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:29.727
I started to get
really stressed

1007
00:50:29.794 --> 00:50:31.462
and didn't want
to go to class.

1008
00:50:31.529 --> 00:50:32.930
I didn't want to
go to work.

1009
00:50:32.997 --> 00:50:36.567
My safe space was really just
staying in my bed

1010
00:50:36.634 --> 00:50:39.137
all day long
with the blinds closed.

1011
00:50:39.204 --> 00:50:42.073
* *

1012
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.010
I couldn't focus. I couldn't
articulate my thoughts.

1013
00:50:46.077 --> 00:50:49.447
* *

1014
00:50:49.514 --> 00:50:52.683
Growing up
in a Christian household.

1015
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.785
we were pretty much taught

1016
00:50:54.852 --> 00:50:58.055
to bring everything to God
in prayer.

1017
00:50:58.123 --> 00:51:01.892
And I was praying harder
and I was praying louder

1018
00:51:01.959 --> 00:51:05.996
and the more I prayed.
nothing really changed for me.

1019
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:08.766
The other factor for me
as a Black man.

1020
00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:10.968
I was. you know.
raised to be able

1021
00:51:11.035 --> 00:51:13.003
to overcome different
adversities

1022
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.806
and so I felt like
to ask for help

1023
00:51:15.873 --> 00:51:18.309
was a sign
that I was incompetent

1024
00:51:18.376 --> 00:51:20.478
or I couldn't figure it out.

1025
00:51:20.545 --> 00:51:22.012
And if I couldn't
figure it out.

1026
00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:24.048
then that meant that...

1027
00:51:24.115 --> 00:51:27.218
you know. I don't deserve
to call myself a man.

1028
00:51:27.285 --> 00:51:29.154
I wanted to stop the pain.

1029
00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:34.425
and the only option that I
thought existed was suicide.

1030
00:51:34.492 --> 00:51:36.427
And I remember
I got a phone call

1031
00:51:36.494 --> 00:51:38.663
from a really
good friend of mine.

1032
00:51:38.729 --> 00:51:41.499
She's asked me if I was okay

1033
00:51:41.566 --> 00:51:43.401
and before
I could even finish.

1034
00:51:43.468 --> 00:51:45.170
she said.
"What you're describing.

1035
00:51:45.236 --> 00:51:46.771
"it sounds like depression.

1036
00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:50.775
and if you need help. you can
see the counselor on campus."

1037
00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:53.010
I remember I was talking
to myself. like.

1038
00:51:53.077 --> 00:51:55.613
"Nah. I don't need. you know.
any help. I'm good.

1039
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.215
I don't need to talk
to a therapist."

1040
00:51:57.282 --> 00:52:01.051
One day. at some point.
I will no longer be depressed.

1041
00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.523
But I had gotten so low.

1042
00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.592
finally went
to the counseling center

1043
00:52:07.658 --> 00:52:10.161
and sat down in front
of a psychiatrist.

1044
00:52:10.228 --> 00:52:13.831
and that's when things
really changed for me.

1045
00:52:13.898 --> 00:52:16.601
I kind of liken it
to having the flu.

1046
00:52:16.667 --> 00:52:18.803
Like. if I had the symptoms
of the flu.

1047
00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:20.971
I wouldn't sit in my room
and just pray

1048
00:52:21.038 --> 00:52:22.873
that the flu is gone.

1049
00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:26.211
I would take some medicine
or I would go see a doctor.

1050
00:52:26.277 --> 00:52:28.946
* *

1051
00:52:29.013 --> 00:52:31.382
Using medication
in the beginning phase

1052
00:52:31.449 --> 00:52:35.886
really helped me to at least
engage in therapy.

1053
00:52:35.953 --> 00:52:37.855
Throughout that process.
it started to take

1054
00:52:37.922 --> 00:52:40.458
more of a holistic approach.

1055
00:52:40.525 --> 00:52:42.727
utilizing
the coping strategies

1056
00:52:42.793 --> 00:52:45.162
that my therapist
shared with me.

1057
00:52:46.697 --> 00:52:48.399
Changing my diet.

1058
00:52:48.466 --> 00:52:50.134
I eliminated some things

1059
00:52:50.201 --> 00:52:54.472
that would feed the symptoms of
depression that I was having.

1060
00:52:54.539 --> 00:52:57.475
I established
different routines.

1061
00:52:57.542 --> 00:53:00.845
I remember the first time my
therapist mentioned journaling

1062
00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:02.347
and that I should try it.

1063
00:53:02.413 --> 00:53:04.148
I was like. "Nah.

1064
00:53:04.215 --> 00:53:06.617
"I will never--
what do I look like

1065
00:53:06.684 --> 00:53:09.354
carrying a diary with me
as a guy?"

1066
00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.956
But as I mentioned. I was so
committed to the process

1067
00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:15.092
that if my therapist said it.
I'm gonna try it. at least.

1068
00:53:15.159 --> 00:53:17.695
[upbeat music]

1069
00:53:17.762 --> 00:53:19.797
And then things got better.

1070
00:53:21.232 --> 00:53:23.801
I was out of school
for about 3 1/2 months

1071
00:53:23.868 --> 00:53:26.404
and every day. I was just
thinking about. like.

1072
00:53:26.471 --> 00:53:30.040
how can I do something
with this experience?

1073
00:53:30.107 --> 00:53:32.677
And. so. when I went
back to school.

1074
00:53:32.743 --> 00:53:34.912
I was on a mission
to be an advocate.

1075
00:53:34.979 --> 00:53:38.549
And I was very uncomfortable
sharing my story.

1076
00:53:38.616 --> 00:53:41.686
but for me.
the mission was greater

1077
00:53:41.752 --> 00:53:43.854
than how uncomfortable I was.

1078
00:53:43.921 --> 00:53:46.624
I am 21.
I'm from south Florida.

1079
00:53:46.691 --> 00:53:48.593
and I am a college student
at this university

1080
00:53:48.659 --> 00:53:51.128
just like you all.

1081
00:53:51.195 --> 00:53:54.098
* *

1082
00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:55.833
Once I got a little bit
more comfortable.

1083
00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.968
I started to reach out
to different fraternities

1084
00:53:58.035 --> 00:54:01.339
and sororities
and student organizations.

1085
00:54:01.406 --> 00:54:04.842
and I noticed that there were
a lot of us on campus

1086
00:54:04.909 --> 00:54:07.244
who were going through
some of the same struggles.

1087
00:54:07.312 --> 00:54:09.714
but no one was really
opening up about it.

1088
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.882
* *

1089
00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:15.052
I think there's this African
proverb where it says.

1090
00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:18.423
Like. "You can go fast alone
or by yourself.

1091
00:54:18.489 --> 00:54:21.292
but you can go far together."

1092
00:54:21.359 --> 00:54:24.895
And I think that's so true
where when you have community.

1093
00:54:24.962 --> 00:54:26.931
you're able to go
so much further.

1094
00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.899
You're able to do so much more

1095
00:54:28.966 --> 00:54:32.803
because you're not carrying
the load all by yourself.

1096
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:37.174
[soft music]

1097
00:54:37.241 --> 00:54:40.345
* *

1098
00:54:40.411 --> 00:54:43.381
- If you could talk to your
younger self right now.

1099
00:54:43.448 --> 00:54:46.083
what would you say?

1100
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:50.187
* *

1101
00:54:50.254 --> 00:54:52.523
- There's not. like.
one big step

1102
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:54.759
to make it all turn around

1103
00:54:54.825 --> 00:54:56.861
and there's not like
probably one piece of advice

1104
00:54:56.927 --> 00:54:59.096
that I could give you
besides. like.

1105
00:54:59.163 --> 00:55:01.231
not giving up
and keeping at it.

1106
00:55:01.298 --> 00:55:02.533
- You're gonna be okay.

1107
00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.835
I know it doesn't
seem like it now. trust me.

1108
00:55:04.902 --> 00:55:07.672
I totally understand that

1109
00:55:07.738 --> 00:55:10.975
it may not seem like it now.
but...

1110
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:14.244
you don't have to reach out
to people in your life.

1111
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:15.746
but reach out to someone.

1112
00:55:15.813 --> 00:55:18.649
- Ask for help.
Ask for support.

1113
00:55:18.716 --> 00:55:21.419
You're worthwhile.
You can do it.

1114
00:55:21.486 --> 00:55:25.956
It won't be easy.
but you can push through this.

1115
00:55:26.023 --> 00:55:30.995
- I totally get being alive
when you don't want to sucks.

1116
00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:35.766
and being depressed
is really hard. but...

1117
00:55:35.833 --> 00:55:39.169
there's no opportunity
to change or get better

1118
00:55:39.236 --> 00:55:40.605
if you're not here.

1119
00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:44.542
- Even with the struggle.
it's...

1120
00:55:44.609 --> 00:55:48.312
it's worth it because just...

1121
00:55:48.379 --> 00:55:50.815
the fact that I can enjoy life

1122
00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:52.817
is something...

1123
00:55:52.883 --> 00:55:54.585
that I didn't know
was possible.

1124
00:55:54.652 --> 00:55:57.455
- Through patience
and understanding

1125
00:55:57.522 --> 00:55:59.924
that this will pass.

1126
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:03.628
that they can experience life
on the other side

1127
00:56:03.694 --> 00:56:06.263
of having suicidal thoughts.

1128
00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:11.168
- Open your heart to new things
every day...

1129
00:56:11.235 --> 00:56:13.571
and work.
Don't stop working.

1130
00:56:13.638 --> 00:56:15.606
- There are--there are...

1131
00:56:15.673 --> 00:56:17.775
trust me.
there are people out there

1132
00:56:17.842 --> 00:56:21.612
who are feeling similar to you
and...

1133
00:56:21.679 --> 00:56:24.815
you know. I'm one of them.

1134
00:56:24.882 --> 00:56:27.918
You may be feeling things also
that you cannot identify

1135
00:56:27.985 --> 00:56:29.987
why you're feeling that way.
That's okay.

1136
00:56:30.054 --> 00:56:32.657
It's okay if you don't know
why you feel a certain way.

1137
00:56:32.723 --> 00:56:34.525
and I wish somebody
had said that to me.

1138
00:56:34.592 --> 00:56:39.497
- I had something that pushed
me to keep talking to people.

1139
00:56:39.564 --> 00:56:45.235
And I think that
is what served me.

1140
00:56:45.302 --> 00:56:47.337
- * Ooh *

1141
00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:53.077

* I'm not the mistakes
that I have made *

1152
00:57:45.429 --> 00:57:49.399
* Or any of the things
that cause me pain *

1153
00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:56.607
* I am not the pieces
of the dreams I left behind *

1154
00:57:56.674 --> 00:58:02.647
* I am light *

1155
00:58:02.713 --> 00:58:06.784

00:58:06.851 --> 00:58:14.091
- * I am light.
I am light *

1157
00:58:14.825 --> 00:58:21.599
* I am light.
I am light *

1158
00:58:21.666 --> 00:58:25.536

of my eyes *

* I am not the *

- * My soul inside *

00:58:37.247 --> 00:58:41.218
- * Is all light *

* I am a god on the inside *

1165
00:58:49.326 --> 00:58:53.130
* I am a star.
a piece of it all *

1166
00:58:53.197 --> 00:58:56.801
* I am light *

1167
00:58:56.867 --> 00:59:02.006
* I am
light *
