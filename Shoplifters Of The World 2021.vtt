Helen!

36
00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:54.584
Dave Kendall here
with the music news.

37
00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:57.626
First up. a breaking story
from the U.K.

38
00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:00.251
After months of speculation
in the press.

39
00:04:00.292 --> 00:04:02.584
The Smiths have officially
gone under.

40
00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.334
The Smiths.
one of the all time greats.

41
00:04:07.376 --> 00:04:10.209
strange ways.
there they go.

42
00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:13.792
No!

43
00:04:17.126 --> 00:04:19.459
Formed in
Manchester in 1982.

44
00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:21.792
The Smiths swiftly
became the voice

45
00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:23.542
of a doomed generation.

46
00:04:23.584 --> 00:04:25.667
They emerged into
the uncertain arena

47
00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:27.376
of early '80s Britain

48
00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:29.126
like a fully formed gang.

49
00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:31.334
and invited you to join.

50
00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:33.876
I feel The Smiths
create their world

51
00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:35.376
and not many groups do that.

52
00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:38.292
And you can either go in
or you can say no.

53
00:04:38.334 --> 00:04:39.917
And it's your choice. really.

54
00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:42.417
We wanted to ditch everything
that people

55
00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:45.084
superficially think
is rock 'n' roll --

56
00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:47.834
leather trousers
and long hair and drugs.

57
00:04:47.876 --> 00:04:50.376
We had something that no one
else could really grasp.

58
00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:52.417
which was. like.
totally ours exclusively.

59
00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.667
Do you have many friends?

60
00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:55.334
No. I don't.

61
00:04:57.876 --> 00:04:59.042
Those that you have.

62
00:04:59.084 --> 00:05:00.959
are they
in the music industry?

63
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.876
They're in the group.
They're in The Smiths.

64
00:05:02.917 --> 00:05:04.626
So The Smiths
are your only friends?

65
00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:06.251
As far as I can see. yeah.

66
00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:28.084
Hey. Cleo.

67
00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:47.417
Hey. Nick Cave.
What did we talk about?

68
00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:49.876
No depressing crap in the store.

69
00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:51.251
The Smiths just broke up.

70
00:05:51.292 --> 00:05:53.167
Oh. maybe because
they called their record

71
00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:54.209
"The World Won't Listen."

72
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:55.542
Way to go. geniuses.

73
00:05:55.584 --> 00:05:56.959
Check this out.

74
00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:05.376
Can't you just picture
fucking to this?

75
00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:06.667
Before you close up.

76
00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:08.292
I need you to re-price
all the CDs.

77
00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:12.042
And you have to check
the security strips.

78
00:06:12.084 --> 00:06:14.542
All of them?
All the CDs.

79
00:06:14.584 --> 00:06:17.167
Wait a minute.

80
00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:19.959
Yes. all of them.

81
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:21.834
And the tapes.

82
00:06:21.876 --> 00:06:23.584
Kids keep peeling them off.

83
00:06:23.626 --> 00:06:25.334
You know what?

84
00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:27.251
If you did your job
for like two seconds.

85
00:06:27.292 --> 00:06:30.001
instead of daydreaming
about Depressed Mode.

86
00:06:30.042 --> 00:06:32.542
half of my stock wouldn't be
walking out of here every day.

87
00:06:32.584 --> 00:06:35.251
I'm only making money
on sunglasses now

88
00:06:35.292 --> 00:06:38.334
KISS 101.
the rock of Denver.

89
00:06:38.376 --> 00:06:40.251
How can you stand it?

90
00:06:40.292 --> 00:06:42.709
There are times
I could murder him.

91
00:06:42.751 --> 00:06:46.084
Dean. Dean.

92
00:06:46.126 --> 00:06:49.167
Dean.

93
00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:50.626
It's not loaded.

94
00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:53.084
Just to scare the shoplifters.

95
00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:03.417
So what do we do now?

96
00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:08.001
Our music died today.
and nobody even cares.

97
00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:14.542
I wish there was a way to get
all the posers in this town

98
00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:17.209
to take notice.

99
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:19.209
You know.
The Smiths may be dead.

100
00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:21.459
but all the albums
are still here.

101
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:24.792
all the records.
seven-inch singles. 12-inches.

102
00:07:24.834 --> 00:07:27.459
We have all
those great bootlegs.

103
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:30.459
That'll be here forever.

104
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:32.709
No one can ever
take it away from us.

105
00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:45.334
I hope you're right.

106
00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:50.167
So you want to hang out?

107
00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:52.167
I can close up early.

108
00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:55.292
Mm.

109
00:07:55.334 --> 00:07:57.667
My friend is going off
to basic training tomorrow.

110
00:07:57.709 --> 00:08:02.667
and everyone is in town
for the weekend to say goodbye.

111
00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:04.167
So...

112
00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:06.667
You know of any good parties?

113
00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:08.542
Me? No.

114
00:08:08.584 --> 00:08:09.792
I was gonna stay in. maybe.

115
00:08:09.834 --> 00:08:10.959
and make you a tape
of this new band

116
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:12.209
from Manchester.

117
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:14.042
New band from Manchester?

118
00:08:14.084 --> 00:08:16.792
Oh. sacrilege.

119
00:08:16.834 --> 00:08:18.542
- Happy Mondays.
- Happy.

120
00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:21.251
Oh. I hate them already.

121
00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:24.126
- I did have another idea.
- What is it?

122
00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:26.542
Something that would go down
in musical history.

123
00:08:26.584 --> 00:08:29.167
But I can't tell you what it is.

124
00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:30.501

- Robert Smith isn't gay.

186
00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:54.876
- I didn't mean --
- Morrissey isn't gay.

187
00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:57.042

00:21:55.126 --> 00:21:56.542
Who?

382
00:21:56.584 --> 00:21:59.542
It's Dean from the record store.

383
00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:00.959
I was in there today.

384
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:02.709
Stealing tapes?

385
00:22:02.751 --> 00:22:05.876
He was almost as upset
about The Smiths breaking up

386
00:22:05.917 --> 00:22:07.334
as I was.

387
00:22:07.376 --> 00:22:08.751
And he had a gun.

388
00:22:08.792 --> 00:22:13.209
Cute. clumsy. and shy.

389
00:22:13.251 --> 00:22:14.459
Doesn't seem the type.

390
00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:16.042
You think he's cute?

391
00:22:16.084 --> 00:22:19.042
What would you die for?

392
00:22:19.084 --> 00:22:21.334
The love of a good woman.

393
00:22:21.376 --> 00:22:24.501
Come on.

394
00:22:24.542 --> 00:22:26.042
Where are you going?

395
00:22:26.084 --> 00:22:27.459
Girl talk.

396
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:34.834
Are you really going
to run away to Europe?

397
00:22:34.876 --> 00:22:36.417
I don't know.

398
00:22:36.459 --> 00:22:40.667
Are you and Patrick
still pretending to be a couple?

399
00:22:40.709 --> 00:22:42.751
I do love him.

400
00:22:42.792 --> 00:22:44.626
Okay. but --

401
00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:46.167
You want your freedom.

402
00:22:47.584 --> 00:22:49.751
We had sex once.

403
00:22:49.792 --> 00:22:51.126
Once.

404
00:22:51.167 --> 00:22:53.084
And then he discovered
The Smiths.

405
00:22:53.126 --> 00:22:56.167
and it was all
no meat. no sex.

406
00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:59.292
And I get it.
Morrissey's celibate.

407
00:22:59.334 --> 00:23:03.209
But God damn it. I'm horny.

408
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:07.376
Do you remember the day
we met Cleo?

409
00:23:07.417 --> 00:23:09.542
I take it you are referring
to the glorious summer

410
00:23:09.584 --> 00:23:12.959
after freshman year
when we all worked at Safeway.

411
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:15.626
She weighed her tits on
that vegetable scale.

412
00:23:17.417 --> 00:23:18.709
Priceless.

413
00:23:18.751 --> 00:23:22.209
Do you ever wonder...?

414
00:23:22.251 --> 00:23:25.001
Wonder what?

415
00:23:25.042 --> 00:23:27.626
What that would be like?

416
00:23:27.667 --> 00:23:29.876
Are you serious?

417
00:23:29.917 --> 00:23:32.584
No. no. of course not.

418
00:23:34.292 --> 00:23:35.876
I do miss that job. though.

419
00:23:35.917 --> 00:23:40.209
The life of a bag boy
was just so simple.

420
00:23:40.251 --> 00:23:43.376
It's so old fashioned to work.

421
00:23:43.417 --> 00:23:45.876
I'd much rather lounge
about the house all day

422
00:23:45.917 --> 00:23:48.459
looking fascinating.

423
00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:51.334
See. this is why I want to
introduce him to Brian Briggs.

424
00:23:51.376 --> 00:23:55.042
He's totally been
with girls and guys.

425
00:23:55.084 --> 00:23:56.917
But why?

426
00:23:56.959 --> 00:23:58.584
Before he flies away to London.

427
00:23:58.626 --> 00:24:00.917
he needs to spread
his wings a little.

428
00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:02.292
Really?

429
00:24:02.334 --> 00:24:05.042

457

462
00:25:34.292 --> 00:25:35.417
Or what?

463
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:38.917
Alright.

464
00:25:44.126 --> 00:25:45.584

466
00:25:46.917 --> 00:25:48.626
It sure is.

467
00:25:48.667 --> 00:25:51.292
You alright up there?
We've gotten reports.

468
00:25:51.334 --> 00:25:55.084
Oh. right. about the. uh --
the deranged hijacker

469
00:25:55.126 --> 00:25:56.542
waving a gun around.

470
00:25:56.584 --> 00:25:58.292
forcing me to play
British records

471
00:25:58.334 --> 00:26:01.001

472
00:26:01.042 --> 00:26:02.417

473
00:26:02.459 --> 00:26:04.584
Oh. nothing. Nothing.
Everything's fine.

00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:11.542

- Are you nuts?
- What?

478
00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:21.042
It's the Denver Police
Department we're talking about.

479
00:26:21.084 --> 00:26:23.001
Come on. what's next?

480
00:26:23.042 --> 00:26:24.376
We got time for a few more

481
00:26:24.417 --> 00:26:25.959
before he calls in
the National Guard.

482
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:28.501
Unless. of course. you want
to blow your brains out.

483
00:26:28.542 --> 00:26:30.167
Personally. if I had nothing
but The Smiths

484
00:26:30.209 --> 00:26:31.292
to listen to all day --

485
00:26:31.334 --> 00:26:32.417
Play the first track.

486
00:26:35.334 --> 00:26:37.876
Why are you doing this to me?

487
00:26:37.917 --> 00:26:40.209
The Smiths broke up.

488
00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:42.709
You should consider
a candlelight vigil.

489
00:26:42.751 --> 00:26:46.042
something slightly
less illegal.

490
00:26:46.084 --> 00:26:49.709
It called for a more
dramatic gesture.

491
00:26:49.751 --> 00:26:52.709
Yeah. well. if the Denver
suicide rate spikes overnight.

492
00:26:52.751 --> 00:26:54.251
it's on your head. not mine.

493
00:26:55.292 --> 00:26:57.459
I tried that once.

494
00:26:57.501 --> 00:27:01.209
Tried what?

495
00:27:01.251 --> 00:27:02.459
Suicide?

496
00:27:02.501 --> 00:27:05.042
Are you serious?

497
00:27:05.084 --> 00:27:07.542
It didn't work. obviously.

498
00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:10.251
Not that it would have
made much of a difference.

499
00:27:11.751 --> 00:27:14.709
I do wonder what's really left
to live for these days.

541

Dance party.

Have fun. Get laid.

544
00:29:41.084 --> 00:29:43.417
- Sounds good to me.
- It's not reality.

545
00:29:43.459 --> 00:29:45.251

546
00:29:45.292 --> 00:29:47.667

549

It's not like
I don't have ambition.

575

00:38:55.251 --> 00:38:59.876
Maybe you should give her
what she's asking for.

715
00:39:01.501 --> 00:39:03.126
I hate sex.

716
00:39:09.417 --> 00:39:11.626
The smoke gets
in my brain.

717
00:39:20.667 --> 00:39:23.501
Johnny plays the mandolin.

718
00:39:23.542 --> 00:39:25.376
What's up with the hearing aid?

719
00:39:25.417 --> 00:39:28.751
Maybe he's trying
to tell you to listen up.

720
00:39:28.792 --> 00:39:31.376
Open your ears and your mind.

721
00:39:31.417 --> 00:39:35.167
This is not
an ordinary rock song.

722
00:39:35.209 --> 00:39:36.709
Why don't you open
your ears. man?

723
00:39:36.751 --> 00:39:38.292
What American city?

724
00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:40.667
You're so obsessed with
Morrissey and the mopey mopes

725
00:39:40.709 --> 00:39:42.709
that you can't hear what's good
about other kinds of music.

726
00:39:44.876 --> 00:39:45.834
What are you doing?

727
00:39:45.876 --> 00:39:47.876
Okay. ease up there. Rebel Yell.

728
00:39:47.917 --> 00:39:49.917
All this talk of mind opening
just reminded me

729
00:39:49.959 --> 00:39:52.501
I've got some pretty killer
Columbian red

730
00:39:52.542 --> 00:39:55.084
in my Kiss lunchbox.

731
00:40:07.834 --> 00:40:10.417
Come on. man.
put the gun down.

732
00:40:10.459 --> 00:40:12.084
Smoke some drugs with me.

733
00:40:17.084 --> 00:40:19.626
Yeah. buddy.

734
00:40:31.417 --> 00:40:35.917
Now. if you don't
mind my asking.

735
00:40:35.959 --> 00:40:38.334
what could be so bad
that you'd want to end it all

736
00:40:38.376 --> 00:40:41.167
before you even graduated
high school?

737
00:40:41.209 --> 00:40:44.209
My life sucked.

738
00:40:44.251 --> 00:40:47.667
No one knew me.
and yet everyone gave me shit.

739
00:40:47.709 --> 00:40:50.001
Even the nerds.

740
00:40:50.042 --> 00:40:53.959
And the girl
I thought I liked.

741
00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:55.917
So I found a razor blade.

742
00:40:59.126 --> 00:41:02.792
I'll never forget. though.
my first day back at work.

743
00:41:02.834 --> 00:41:06.542
we got this new import in.

744
00:41:06.584 --> 00:41:08.001
I had never
heard of them before.

745
00:41:08.042 --> 00:41:12.709
I just listened to it
over and over again.

746
00:41:12.751 --> 00:41:14.917
It's like nothing
I'd ever heard.

747
00:41:14.959 --> 00:41:18.084
Martyrdom
and meaningless death.

748
00:41:18.126 --> 00:41:22.292
guilt and heroism.
sex and celibacy.

749
00:41:22.334 --> 00:41:26.417
catharsis and deceit.

750
00:41:28.126 --> 00:41:33.084
All the horrors
you have to face up to.

751
00:41:33.126 --> 00:41:35.667
I owe them everything.

752
00:41:36.584 --> 00:41:38.376
They saved my life.

753
00:41:38.417 --> 00:41:41.751
Well. in the end. man.
they're just a band.

754
00:41:41.792 --> 00:41:43.459
They break up all the time.

755
00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:46.167
But they are
the only band that matters.

756
00:41:46.209 --> 00:41:49.501
Clearly never listened
to Twisted fucking Sister.

757
00:41:59.167 --> 00:42:02.001
You know. dude.

758
00:42:02.042 --> 00:42:04.292
one day your heroes
are going to grow old.

759
00:42:04.334 --> 00:42:06.876
and they're going to change.

760
00:42:06.917 --> 00:42:09.292
And they're going to put out
shitty music.

761
00:42:09.334 --> 00:42:13.251
And they're going to say stupid
things that betray the past.

762
00:42:13.292 --> 00:42:15.751
In the end.
they will only disappoint you.

763
00:42:15.792 --> 00:42:17.501
Jesus.

764
00:42:17.542 --> 00:42:20.876
Are you sure
you're not a Smiths fan?

765
00:42:20.917 --> 00:42:25.459
I know "It's Over" is next.
but it is far from being so.

766
00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:27.459
But don't despair. Denver.

767
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:32.001
Relax. have a smoke.
have a toke.

768
00:42:32.042 --> 00:42:35.584
You might find it actually
starts to grow on you.

769
00:42:35.626 --> 00:42:38.417

00:42:49.542 --> 00:42:52.542
I stole a joint
from one of those jocks.

774
00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:08.376
You know. I could have
kicked that guy's ass.

775
00:43:08.417 --> 00:43:10.584
Why'd you stop me?

776
00:43:10.626 --> 00:43:16.001
It was enough that you tried
to defend my honor.

777
00:43:27.126 --> 00:43:29.292
You want to know something?

778
00:43:29.334 --> 00:43:30.667
What?

779
00:43:30.709 --> 00:43:34.084
I fucking hate
Molly Ringwald.

780
00:43:34.126 --> 00:43:37.167
- Huh?
- Not her as a person.

781
00:43:37.209 --> 00:43:39.417
but. like.
in "Pretty in Pink."

782
00:43:39.459 --> 00:43:41.376
what was that about.
really?

783
00:43:42.959 --> 00:43:50.417
She's so worried about being
liked by this preppy asshole.

784
00:43:50.459 --> 00:43:54.792
She's got a cool job
and awesome clothes.

785
00:43:54.834 --> 00:43:59.126
And it's some big deal

786
00:43:59.167 --> 00:44:02.834
for someone normal to like her
and go to prom.

787
00:44:06.042 --> 00:44:12.584
Her cool best friend
is in love with her.

788
00:44:12.626 --> 00:44:17.126
and she's kind of a bitch
about it.

789
00:44:17.167 --> 00:44:20.209
Is that supposed
to be our lives?

790
00:44:20.251 --> 00:44:22.209
Soundtrack is killer.

791
00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:24.042
They have no idea.

792
00:44:24.084 --> 00:44:28.917
That freckled freak should
try living with my mother

793
00:44:28.959 --> 00:44:33.792
and the losers
she brings home.

794
00:44:35.876 --> 00:44:40.042
I'd leap in front
of a flying bullet for you.

795
00:44:41.834 --> 00:44:43.876
I know.

796
00:44:50.167 --> 00:44:55.834
We tried. We failed.

797
00:44:55.876 --> 00:44:59.417
We're much better off
as friends.

798
00:44:59.459 --> 00:45:01.834
I'm just a joke to you.

799
00:45:02.751 --> 00:45:06.584
I know there's no French
boyfriend waiting for you.

800
00:45:06.626 --> 00:45:09.792
I'm real and I'm right here.

801
00:45:09.834 --> 00:45:11.834
You don't care.

802
00:45:11.876 --> 00:45:14.709
After tonight. we might not
see each other again.

803
00:45:14.751 --> 00:45:18.334
You think you're so much better
than everybody else here.

804
00:45:18.376 --> 00:45:20.501
but really.
you are going nowhere fast.

805
00:45:20.542 --> 00:45:22.126
just like the rest
of the losers in this town.

806
00:45:22.167 --> 00:45:25.084
I'm going somewhere.
Okay?

807
00:45:25.126 --> 00:45:27.751
I might even leave tonight.

808
00:45:27.792 --> 00:45:30.001

827
00:46:42.126 --> 00:46:45.167
The true mystery of the world
is the visible.

828
00:46:45.209 --> 00:46:49.084
not the invisible.

829
00:46:49.126 --> 00:46:51.001
Oscar Wilde said that.

830
00:46:54.376 --> 00:46:55.709
Does this look like someone

831
00:46:55.751 --> 00:46:57.709
who should be joining
the armed forces?

832
00:47:02.459 --> 00:47:04.751

my insides and my outsides

833
00:47:04.792 --> 00:47:08.584
don't match. you know?

834
00:47:08.626 --> 00:47:11.709
Like. am I in love with Cleo.

835
00:47:11.751 --> 00:47:13.459
or do I want to be her?

836
00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:15.376
Am I a man or a woman?

837
00:47:15.417 --> 00:47:18.626
Am I alive or dead?

838
00:47:18.667 --> 00:47:20.459
I look in the mirror sometimes.

839
00:47:20.501 --> 00:47:24.709
and I don't know
who I'm looking at.

840
00:47:24.751 --> 00:47:27.001
You ever do that?

841
00:47:31.126 --> 00:47:32.542
When I was 14.

842
00:47:32.584 --> 00:47:34.667
I took down all the mirrors
in our house.

843
00:47:37.626 --> 00:47:41.334
If I look long enough.
I disappear.

844
00:47:44.334 --> 00:47:47.626
I can't believe the Army
is letting in such a headcase.

845
00:47:49.001 --> 00:47:51.917
But part of me wants to do it.
you know.

846
00:47:51.959 --> 00:47:56.876
maybe -- maybe just
to please my dad. I guess.

847
00:47:57.667 --> 00:48:00.126
But then another part of me
just wants to smoke joints.

848
00:48:00.167 --> 00:48:02.292
hang out. have friendly wanks

849
00:48:02.334 --> 00:48:05.584

850
00:48:11.042 --> 00:48:12.542
Oh.

851
00:48:12.584 --> 00:48:15.042
Am I 2 people or 100?

852
00:48:15.084 --> 00:48:18.876
I've only ever known
one of you.

853
00:48:18.917 --> 00:48:22.667
Wow. I am impressed.

854
00:48:22.709 --> 00:48:25.292
You didn't think
I was cool. did you?

855
00:48:25.334 --> 00:48:27.584
No.

856
00:48:27.626 --> 00:48:30.001
The senior class trip
to London.

857
00:48:30.042 --> 00:48:32.042
we get invited
to this really cool party.

858
00:48:32.084 --> 00:48:33.459
We get super drunk

859
00:48:33.501 --> 00:48:36.251
and steal it
right off the guy's wall.

860
00:48:36.292 --> 00:48:37.834
Him and his friends
were so pissed.

861
00:48:37.876 --> 00:48:39.209
they chased us
all around Piccadilly.

862
00:48:39.251 --> 00:48:44.292
but we jumped into a cab
and escaped.

863
00:48:45.292 --> 00:48:46.667
Hey.

864
00:48:48.542 --> 00:48:50.584

You're like Bonnie and Clyde.
except without Bonnie.

1084
01:06:04.292 --> 01:06:06.417
Her name is Cleo.

1085
01:06:06.459 --> 01:06:08.084
The girl who called in?

1086
01:06:08.126 --> 01:06:11.084
Yeah. she. uh. comes
into the store I work at

1087
01:06:11.126 --> 01:06:12.751
to steal tapes.

1088
01:06:15.084 --> 01:06:16.834
You're in love with her.

1089
01:06:16.876 --> 01:06:19.584
but you think
she doesn't notice you.

1090
01:06:19.626 --> 01:06:21.626
You're just the guy
she uses to get her fix.

1091
01:06:21.667 --> 01:06:24.542
and that's it.

1092
01:06:24.584 --> 01:06:27.042
Pretty much.

1093
01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:29.292
Yeah. I know the feeling.

1094
01:06:29.334 --> 01:06:31.751
Can you imagine how many
hot metal chicks out there

1095
01:06:31.792 --> 01:06:34.167
listen to my show every week?

1096
01:06:34.209 --> 01:06:37.542
They listen next to
their mullet-headed boyfriends.

1097
01:06:37.584 --> 01:06:40.876
Guys like you and me.
we provide the fantasy.

1098
01:06:40.917 --> 01:06:42.876
We're not real to them.

1099
01:06:42.917 --> 01:06:46.959
But that girl did call in.

1100
01:06:47.001 --> 01:06:50.626
She was talking directly to you.

1101
01:06:50.667 --> 01:06:54.084
So what do I do?

1102
01:06:54.126 --> 01:06:56.709
I'd dedicate a song to her.

1103
01:06:56.751 --> 01:06:58.251
That's just me.

1104
01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:03.917
What about you?

1105
01:07:03.959 --> 01:07:06.417
You married.
got a girlfriend?

1106
01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:12.251
Yeah. I was married.

1107
01:07:12.292 --> 01:07:15.959
But she left me.

1108
01:07:16.001 --> 01:07:18.709
About a year ago.

1109
01:07:18.751 --> 01:07:21.251
Same day "Master of Puppets"
came out.

1110
01:07:24.292 --> 01:07:30.292
I had it on super loud
in my headphones all day.

1111
01:07:30.334 --> 01:07:32.209
I didn't even hear her leave.

1112
01:07:35.417 --> 01:07:37.542
There I was in thrash nirvana.

1113
01:07:37.584 --> 01:07:42.459
no idea that the love of my life
was about to rip my guts out.

1114
01:07:42.501 --> 01:07:47.126
I haven't been able to listen
to that album since.

1115
01:07:47.167 --> 01:07:50.042
How long were you together?

1116
01:07:50.084 --> 01:07:53.709
Since high school.

1117
01:07:53.751 --> 01:07:55.417
Why did you break up?

1118
01:07:58.709 --> 01:08:02.542
I guess the metal lifestyle
just wasn't for her.

1119
01:08:02.584 --> 01:08:06.959
And she hated
that I worked nights.

1120
01:08:09.376 --> 01:08:13.376
We just grew apart.

1121
01:08:13.417 --> 01:08:15.751
She grew up and I didn't.

1122
01:08:22.209 --> 01:08:25.292
Denver.

1123
01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:28.459
Don't forget the songs
that made you cry

1124
01:08:28.501 --> 01:08:30.792
or the songs
that saved your lives.

1125
01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:33.792
You may be crying
for more metal.

1126
01:08:33.834 --> 01:08:36.751
but through those tears.

1127
01:08:36.792 --> 01:08:40.167
we must open our hearts
and our ears.

1128
01:08:40.209 --> 01:08:44.501
Sometimes salvation
is louder than bombs.

1129
01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:00.376
One last stop.

1130
01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:02.042
Oh. not
the sketchy gay bar.

1131
01:09:02.084 --> 01:09:03.917
Billy's not getting
on that bus tomorrow

1132
01:09:03.959 --> 01:09:06.792
without a proper
after-hours send off.

1133
01:09:06.834 --> 01:09:10.084
We will never get in.

1134
01:09:10.126 --> 01:09:15.667
Hey. pull up to my bumper.
baby.

1135
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:17.376
How old are you?

1136
01:09:17.417 --> 01:09:19.542
He's old enough
to join Reagan's army.

01:09:19.584 --> 01:09:21.084

1138

The intrepid
Denver Police Department

1225

What?

1232
01:17:15.334 --> 01:17:16.834
There's a murky river

1233
01:17:16.876 --> 01:17:18.459
of musical history
running through these songs.

1234
01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:20.126
from Bo Diddley to Bowie.

1235
01:17:20.167 --> 01:17:22.584
from Presley and Sinatra.

1236
01:17:22.626 --> 01:17:24.334
to the Dolls and T.Rex.

1237
01:17:24.376 --> 01:17:27.292

to Manchester.

1238
01:17:29.251 --> 01:17:31.042
Tonight. two musical cultures

1239
01:17:31.084 --> 01:17:33.209
reached across the divide
to each other.

1240
01:17:33.251 --> 01:17:35.917
and it seems that
in these uncertain times

1241
01:17:35.959 --> 01:17:38.459
of chaos and fear.

1242
01:17:38.501 --> 01:17:41.667
a song can still
save your life.

1243
01:17:41.709 --> 01:17:43.334
it's all or nothing
with The Smiths

1244
01:17:43.376 --> 01:17:44.459
and those that love them.

1245
01:17:44.501 --> 01:17:45.459
It is life and death.

1246
01:17:45.501 --> 01:17:47.584
It's music full of love and hate

1247
01:17:47.626 --> 01:17:50.084
and passions
just like ours.

1248
01:17:53.334 --> 01:17:57.959
And all these kids out there.
they sing for them.

1249
01:18:03.376 --> 01:18:05.459
There's history in this music.

1250
01:18:05.501 --> 01:18:07.959
and there's history happening
right here. right now.

1251
01:18:08.001 --> 01:18:12.251
I can't believe this.
but yes. folks. it's true.

1252
01:18:12.292 --> 01:18:13.959
The queen is dead.

1253
01:18:17.876 --> 01:18:19.709
Long live The Smiths.

1254
01:18:22.292 --> 01:18:26.459
Oh. before I sign off.

1255
01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:31.042
Here's one more song for that
sweet and tender hooligan.

1256
01:18:31.084 --> 01:18:34.167
He wanted me to dedicate it
to a very special shoplifter

1257
01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:37.501
out there somewhere.

1258
01:18:37.542 --> 01:18:39.709

- Hey. can you take our picture?
- Sure.

1277
01:20:47.834 --> 01:20:49.084
Thank you.

1278
01:21:04.417 --> 01:21:06.042
The meetings
between the group members

1279
01:21:06.084 --> 01:21:07.501
were very accidental.

1280
01:21:07.542 --> 01:21:09.376
It was also
a very barren time

1281
01:21:09.417 --> 01:21:11.376
when everybody seemed
to be lost.

1282
01:21:11.417 --> 01:21:15.001
and the vile elements
were taking over.

1283
01:21:19.417 --> 01:21:22.542
Four strangers cannot
simply huddle together

1284
01:21:22.584 --> 01:21:24.209
and do what we do.

1285
01:21:24.251 --> 01:21:26.042
And whatever happens.

1286
01:21:26.084 --> 01:21:27.667
well. there has to be some kind

1287
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:31.376
of mystical communion
between them and some bond.

1288
01:21:35.209 --> 01:21:37.209
But with the Smiths
on another level.

1289
01:21:37.251 --> 01:21:39.709
I really do think
it is true.

1290
01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:44.001
I think this is really more
or less the end of the story.

1291
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:51.792
I came to bail you out.

1292
01:22:51.834 --> 01:22:54.417
stole all this money.
and everything.

1293
01:22:54.459 --> 01:22:56.626
Mickey won't press charges.

1294
01:22:56.667 --> 01:22:58.626
Some revolution.

1295
01:22:58.667 --> 01:23:00.834
Bunch of freaks spent the night
in the parking lot.

1296
01:23:00.876 --> 01:23:02.376
Should have been
on the front page.

1297
01:23:02.417 --> 01:23:07.042
but by tomorrow.
it'll be like it never happened.

1298
01:23:07.084 --> 01:23:09.126
I'll never forget it.

1299
01:23:12.376 --> 01:23:14.792
Come on. you look
like you need a ride.

1300
01:23:14.834 --> 01:23:17.167
Where are you going?

1301
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:18.709
I don't know.
Where are you going?

1302
01:23:18.751 --> 01:23:20.626
Anywhere.

1303
01:23:20.667 --> 01:23:22.042

1304
01:23:22.084 --> 01:23:25.084
