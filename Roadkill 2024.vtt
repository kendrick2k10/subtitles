00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.150
You little shit.

4
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.286
You little shit.

5
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.795
You think I got money to stuff
your face with people food?

6
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.044
Get out of this house.

7
00:03:22.128 --> 00:03:23.770
Get out.

8
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.405
That's going to cost you. boy.

9
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.645
That's going to cost you.

10
00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:02.760
Now you don't have to fight
over the dog food no more.

11
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.154
Daddy.

12
00:09:58.535 --> 00:09:59.335
Hi.

13
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.916
Do you live here?

14
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.936
No.

15
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:08.986
No.

16
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.106
I was just going to see
if they had some water.

17
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.116
Just passing through.

18
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.236
You're just walking?

19
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.986
Yeah.

20
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:22.630
Lost my job and they took my car. so.

21
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.101
Oh.

22
00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:28.985
Why?

23
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.926
Um. I'm just really
lost on these back roads.

24
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.256
You know how far to Abbeville?

25
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.186
That's where I'm going.

26
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.866
Really?

27
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.606
Been trying to get there before tomorrow.

28
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.306
My mom. it's her birthday.

29
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.451
Oh.

30
00:10:50.535 --> 00:10:51.335
It's pretty far.

31
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:04.671
Wait.

32
00:11:04.755 --> 00:11:05.555
No. wait.

33
00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:09.275
Maybe we can help each other?

34
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.130
You're not a maniac or anything. are you?

35
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.776
This music bother you?

36
00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.926
I don't know if you're
into it or anything.

37
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:00.810
It's fine.

38
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.876
It's kind of embarrassing.

39
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.739
Girls and directions. am I right?

40
00:12:08.823 --> 00:12:10.365
I usually know right where I'm going.

41
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.706
Pretty tough about what happened.

42
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.566
You know. your situation.

43
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:22.880
I hope things get worked out.

44
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.296
Thanks.

45
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.726
Yeah.

46
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:28.873
It's nice though.

47
00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.540
You thinking of your mother like that.

48
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.546
So what have you got in Abbeville?

49
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.591
Well. it's kind of personal.

50
00:12:44.675 --> 00:12:45.475
OK.

51
00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.196
Been on the run a while. huh?

52
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.644
What?

53
00:12:53.728 --> 00:12:55.145
You've been on the road a while?

54
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.186
Yeah.

55
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.179
Yeah. it's been a long day.

56
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.166
My fish is bigger than yours.

57
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.396
No. it's really not.

58
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.206
It's really not.

59
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.679
You're clearly blind.

60
00:13:31.763 --> 00:13:34.346
Let's measure them when we get
home. and we'll see about that.

61
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.290
OK. I think you're wrong. but. OK. we can.

62
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.456
Oh.

63
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.340
Uh.

64
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:52.606
Dude.
Go.

65
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:53.586
Go.
Go.

66
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.470
Go.

67
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.966
You know how far to the next station?

68
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.015
Not really sure. but it's a ways.

69
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:12.726
Better fill up.

70
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:13.610
Don't you think?

71
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.406
You need anything?

72
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.206
No.

73
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.048
I'll probably hit the restroom.

74
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.160
Hello?

75
00:16:06.685 --> 00:16:07.485
You open?

76
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.616
You've been there long?

77
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.026
I was asking for someone.

78
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.146
I can't hear a damn thing anymore.

79
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.496
Sorry.

80
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.626
I'll be with you in just a minute.

81
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.930
I got to check on something
out back right quick.

82
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.860
You're a pretty little thing. aren't you?

83
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.406
You can't leave the pump unattended.

84
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.620
It's County ordinance.

85
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.606
You may not know if you're
not from around here.

86
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.464
but we're just all about safety.

87
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.636
That's a fine looking car.

88
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.020
You. uh. you just passing through?

89
00:17:25.285 --> 00:17:26.085
Yeah.

90
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.711
Where you headed?

91
00:17:37.795 --> 00:17:38.595
North.

92
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.516
What's your name?

93
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.440
What's yours?

94
00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.446
Trying to be smart with me. boy?

95
00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.506
No. sir.

96
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.376
I mean. we're just having a conversation.

97
00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.436
You trying to turn this
into something else?

98
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.736
Possible signal three. mile marker 14.

99
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.556
Sheriff. you on the air?

100
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.456
Go ahead.

101
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.426
Just off the main
highway about a half a mile

102
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.400
South. coroners en route.

103
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.446
Respect for authority
make the rest of your stay

104
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.340
a whole lot easier.

105
00:18:20.925 --> 00:18:21.725
On my way.

106
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.766
You have a nice day.

107
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:32.534
Don't let the county line hit
you in the ass on the way out.

108
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.217
Yeah. about time.

109
00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.560
Not too friendly around here.

110
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.100
County to Sheriff.

111
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.476
What do you got?

112
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.066
Media's on the line.

113
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.286
Can we send them to the scene?

114
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.986
Bastards.

115
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.606
I don't even know what we got yet.

116
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.940
You tell them we'll make
a call when it's clear.

117
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.826
What the hell?

118
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.566
What happened?

119
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.306
We almost hit it.

120
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:15.801
What are you talking about?

121
00:20:15.885 --> 00:20:16.685
Hit what?

122
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.776
You ran yourself off the
road. risking both our lives.

123
00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.356
for a damn turtle.

124
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.216
I saw it at the last second.

125
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.381
Like I said. you ran yourself off the--

126
00:20:40.465 --> 00:20:42.856
it wouldn't have hurt the car.

127
00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.266
You could just run it over.

128
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.276
Now don't be like that.

129
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.086
It was in a hopeless situation.

130
00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.781
Could have happened to anyone.

131
00:20:52.865 --> 00:20:53.990
What if it happened to you?

132
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.026
John.

133
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.636
Well. it didn't take him
long to get back at it

134
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.406
again. whoever it is. I mean.

135
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.806
How long?

136
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.026
Ah. 24 hours.

137
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.890
I'll get my paperwork.

138
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.776
Corey. you in the area?

139
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.526
Heading to the call.

140
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:13.193
Hey. well. we need help.

141
00:22:13.277 --> 00:22:14.026
Be there in a few.

142
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.615
I'm getting waved down by
somebody. might be a crash.

143
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:31.510
Thanks.

144
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.906
Y'all all right?

145
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:37.479
Just a little stuck.

146
00:22:37.563 --> 00:22:39.230
Do you think you could help pull us out?

147
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.386
What. you didn't crash into nothing?

148
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.336
No.

149
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.316
Kind of ran off the road.

150
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.206
A turtle.

151
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.910
A little turtle.

152
00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.016
Please?

153
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.060
I don't have AAA.

154
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.046
I might have something
I can pull you out with.

155
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.426
I got to hurry though.

156
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.551
I got a serious call
I got to get to.

157
00:23:12.635 --> 00:23:13.435
Thanks.

158
00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.646
Where would you tie it off to?

159
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.490
I'll find a spot on the frame
just like a wrecker would.

160
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.736
This might work.

161
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.680
Here. hold that.

162
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.926
Where are you all headed?

163
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.906
Back to Buxton.

164
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.658
Well. that's not far.

165
00:23:47.742 --> 00:23:49.200
I think we can get you on your way.

166
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.236
Well. a couple of them are
already talking Highway Hunter.

167
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.026
I don't think so.

168
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.956
Well. you'd know better
than anyone. even me.

169
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.406
Like I said. looks similar.

170
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.696
It'd be the first one in over a year.

171
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:23.800
That we know of.

172
00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.576
Now. most of the other victims
were drifters or homeless.

173
00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.486
prostitutes no one cared about.

174
00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.946
They got local ties. but other than that.

175
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.500
the MO looks the same.

176
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.296
Just get me some prints or something.

177
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.190
Yes. sir.

178
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.916
Got to go.

179
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.712
Y'all be safe on your trip.

180
00:25:10.796 --> 00:25:14.346
Corey. where are you at?

181
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.616
I'm on my way.

182
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.445
Ma'am. look out for them turtles.

183
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.396
I'm starving.

184
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.006
Got some jerky in my pack.

185
00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.136
I was thinking more like
a sandwich or something.

186
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.020
It's on me.

187
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.066
That'll have to do.

188
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.416
A six letter word for lazy.

189
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:35.216
Slothful. avoids work at all costs.

190
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.586
You got that one there?

191
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:44.036
How many times I got to tell
you my name is seven letters.

192
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.226
A-L-L-I-S-O-N. You
should try one of these.

193
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.016
Might help with your ignorance.

194
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.296
Yeah. yeah.

195
00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.090
You're such an ass.

196
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.336
Come on. up.

197
00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.943
Up.

198
00:27:01.027 --> 00:27:02.360
You can sit anywhere you like.

199
00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:09.696
Hello. there.

200
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.096
Can I get you all something to drink?

201
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.776
Do you have a sandwich?

202
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.006
Just like a club sandwich?

203
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:15.996
Yeah. sure.

204
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.286
Club.

205
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.616
Do you want fries or chips with that?

206
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.836
Nothing fried.

207
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.706
OK.

208
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.600
For you. sir?

209
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.026
The same.

210
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.826
Same.

211
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:30.656
OK.

212
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.686
How about some homemade lemonade?

213
00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:34.716
Yeah. sure.

214
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.966
We're just kind of in a hurry.

215
00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.190
It won't be but a minute.

216
00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.196
Signal three times two.

217
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.926
Signal three at Lester's.

218
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.920
Acknowledge.

219
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.716
Is that verified?

220
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.066
Caller on scene.

221
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:59.366
They say confirm but we
got rescue on its way.

222
00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.186
I'm right there.

223
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.640
I'm coming up on it now.

224
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.170
So that's all you saw?

225
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.946
OK. I got you.

226
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.186
Thanks. Quentin.

227
00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.220
I appreciate you.

228
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.716
Well. we didn't see anyone.
so they walked through

229
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.046
and found them in the back.

230
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:26.846
Them?

231
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.946
Lester and that girl that works for him.

232
00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.516
They're both gone.

233
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.400
Shit.

234
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:43.041
County. get a BOLO out on a red Nova

235
00:28:43.125 --> 00:28:45.500
heading North on the main line
with a white. male driver.

236
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:58.308
By the back door and outside.

237
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.220
Tastes like sugary pond water.

238
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.320
Oh.

239
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:27.716
So what was that business
back there about Buxton?

240
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.056
You are heading to
Abbeville. right?

241
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:31.856
Yeah.

242
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.776
Why?

243
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:38.456
Because-- because you
said otherwise to the cop.

244
00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.716
Really?

245
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.646
Yeah.

246
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.556
He asked where we were
heading and you said Buxton.

247
00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.536
There you go.

248
00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.028
Here y'all go.

249
00:29:47.112 --> 00:29:49.070
Let me know if I can get
you anything else. OK?

250
00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.686
So what about it?

251
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.486
Forget.

252
00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:02.823
It

253
00:30:02.907 --> 00:30:03.740
Aren't you hungry?

254
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.780
What?

255
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.536
I don't know. I just
thought you'd be hungry.

256
00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.846
I get by OK.

257
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.315
Just a little bad luck is all lately.

258
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.110
Thanks.

259
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.286
I'm not trying to get all
in your business or anything

260
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:36.786
but what's a girl like you doing out

261
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.606
here in the middle of nowhere?

262
00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:43.206
Is that what this is.
the middle of nowhere?

263
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:44.496
Pretty much.

264
00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.536
And this ain't exactly the easiest way

265
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.426
to get to Abbeville.

266
00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.966
Or Buxton anyway.

267
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.096
Interstates are overrated.

268
00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.006
Besides. I like a good road trip.

269
00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.376
Alone?

270
00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.686
Not the safest way to travel.

271
00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.936
Never been the cautious type.

272
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.326
Yeah. I see that. like
picking up strangers.

273
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.176
I don't usually do that.

274
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.916
You were actually my first.

275
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.226
Oh. I was your first.

276
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.963
I'm honored.

277
00:31:16.047 --> 00:31:17.796
Usually. if I need to stop for directions.

278
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.050
I'll just pull over and ask.
but now I don't have to.

279
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:35.106
No. the witness didn't see
anything or anyone around.

280
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.816
They just found them like this.

281
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.700
Gees.

282
00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.316
Listen. I was just up there.

283
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.396
Did you get the BOLO?

284
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.664
What BOLO?

285
00:31:46.748 --> 00:31:47.706
The one I just put out.

286
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:49.956
The red Nova.

287
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.296
Red Nova?

288
00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.076
I might have just saw it.

289
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.816
Where?

290
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.866
Well. it had to be the
one I stopped out with.

291
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.056
You got to be shitting
me. the one that wrecked?

292
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.166
They ran off into a ditch.

293
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:03.966
They?

294
00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.586
A guy and a girl.

295
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.446
I knew they were acting funny.

296
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.816
And you didn't do nothing about it?

297
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.376
Where the hell are they now?

298
00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.436
Well. I pulled them out.

299
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.086
And they just drove off?

300
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.876
They weren't locals. Corey.

301
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.616
She said that she was from Buxton.

302
00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.446
You didn't even run them?

303
00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:25.886
I-- I was in a hurry.

304
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.236
I had to get up to your scene.

305
00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.166
We had a God damn murder
investigation going.

306
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.226
Sheriff.

307
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.346
You get out that right
now. and you find them.

308
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:35.096
I'm leaving here to come up to your scene.

309
00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.076
The coroner already left.

310
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.344
They can be anywhere by now.

311
00:32:38.428 --> 00:32:39.386
Don't worry about that.

312
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.303
You get on the road and
run to the state line.

313
00:32:41.387 --> 00:32:43.676
He may have that girl against her will.

314
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.570
On my way.

315
00:33:01.427 --> 00:33:03.010
I will be in the little girls' room.

316
00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.626
We interrupt our program
for this Special Report.

317
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:23.986
Authorities are responding to a
wooded area off of County Road

318
00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:27.406
12. where the bodies of an
unidentified man and woman

319
00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:30.256
were found today by two young boys.

320
00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.505
The community wonders has
the Highway Hunter returned?

321
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.656
Join us at 5:00 for details
and a special report

322
00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.936
on the four year history of the killings.

323
00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.456
as well as the Sheriff. who has claimed

324
00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.576
to have ended the terror.

325
00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.886
We've really got to get going.

326
00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.716
Ready?

327
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.869
Thanks.

328
00:36:15.953 --> 00:36:16.870
Y'all have a good day.

329
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.366
What the hell. Doc?

330
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.896
Well. it was quick.

331
00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:46.256
They each took and would have
put them down right away.

332
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.366
Whoever it was was in a great. big hurry.

333
00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:51.693
Not random either. I suppose.

334
00:36:51.777 --> 00:36:53.776
Definitely not same MO
of your hunter. if that's

335
00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.316
what you're looking for.

336
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.706
Now. the girl she took
a blade or something

337
00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.386
similar to her temple.

338
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:03.266
Cutting her throat was an afterthought.

339
00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:04.126
Huh.

340
00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:07.276
Well. Lester here. he
might have walked up on it.

341
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.956
I don't know.

342
00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.926
Got hit in the head with a solid object.

343
00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.186
Like what?

344
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:14.986
I'm not sure.

345
00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:17.296
Lots of solid objects around.

346
00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.456
We're still looking.

347
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.425
Just what we need. another
headline for the paper.

348
00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.003
I'll be goddamned.

349
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:53.600
I think it's the same guy.

350
00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.800
Uh. you want to. you know?

351
00:38:06.521 --> 00:38:07.356
Wait.

352
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.716
What are you doing?

353
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.586
Son of a bitch.

354
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:15.376
I got a runner headed northbound
on the main stretch. tag

355
00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.456
reading 456 Lima. Bravo. Quebec.

356
00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.646
10-4 Sheriff. copy?

357
00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:22.946
Corey. what do you got?

358
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.746
It's that car.

359
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:24.546
It's the one.

360
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.396
It ain't stopping.

361
00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.479
County. get a hold of
North Lake for assistance.

362
00:38:27.563 --> 00:38:28.636
Try the state too.

363
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.136
- 10-4.
- I'm heading out.

364
00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.137
You let me know if there's
anybody else close.

365
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.738
What the hell?

366
00:38:41.822 --> 00:38:42.946
What are you worried about?

367
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.236
I'm the one driving.

368
00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.216
I just--

369
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.296
I can't be stopped.

370
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.766
Why?

371
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.566
I kind of don't have a license.

372
00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:46.266
Oh. that's great.

373
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.330
Great.

374
00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:16.114
Shit.

375
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:00.976
I'm out.

376
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.976
Vehicle damage.

377
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.316
Suspect last seen headed northbound

378
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.909
on Old Mill Road near Tanner.

379
00:41:07.993 --> 00:41:08.793
Shit.

380
00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.430
County. give me the status
of those roadblocks.

381
00:41:29.532 --> 00:41:30.476
Not bad.

382
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.426
I can't believe
I just did that.

383
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:33.296
Me either.

384
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:35.526
You are such a bad influence.

385
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:36.410
Me?

386
00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.021
Where'd you learn to
drive like that anyway?

387
00:41:42.105 --> 00:41:42.905
TV.

388
00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.506
I'm not exactly sure where we're at.

389
00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.596
but you should probably find
a spot to lay low till they

390
00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.766
think we're long gone.

391
00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:52.936
I can't stop.

392
00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:53.776
Not now.

393
00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.846
They're going to be everywhere.

394
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.166
You think so?

395
00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:58.753
I'm telling you.

396
00:41:58.837 --> 00:42:01.045
Well. don't you know
another way. like a back road?

397
00:42:05.152 --> 00:42:07.026
I've only been through
here a couple of times

398
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:10.116
before. but maybe.

399
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.436
Keep going.

400
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.470
We'll look for a sign or something.

401
00:42:32.415 --> 00:42:33.215
Frankie?

402
00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.251
Frank. what are you sick or something?

403
00:42:41.335 --> 00:42:42.135
Oh. man.

404
00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.046
Hey. everything's done.

405
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:50.056
You said I could leave early.

406
00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:50.940
Hey.

407
00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:54.810
Hey!

408
00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:59.816
You did not leave me here by myself again.

409
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.478
Bastard.

410
00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:19.696
It's the last route I can think

411
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.666
of this side of the county.

412
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:26.116
It's like they got them all covered.

413
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.286
You must've really pissed them off.

414
00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:34.816
Like I said. we got to hide
out till they call it off.

415
00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.376
Maybe even change cars.

416
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.866
I'm not leaving my car.

417
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:39.676
OK.

418
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.406
All right.

419
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:46.456
You think they never had a
car run from them before.

420
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.096
It probably wasn't the
smartest idea. was it?

421
00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:53.326
Well. now. it's done.

422
00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:54.556
You can get out of this.

423
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.246
Just got to be smart about it.

424
00:43:58.330 --> 00:43:59.356
Come on.

425
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.026
I think I know a place you can
back into the woods real good.

426
00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:04.066
but we're going to have to double back.

427
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:06.536
Almost where you first picked me up.

428
00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.936
I don't--

429
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.486
Just go straight across
here. take the first left

430
00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:11.791
and head South.

431
00:44:11.875 --> 00:44:12.925
And be careful.

432
00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:17.656
You're sure?

433
00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:18.820
Yeah. trust me.

434
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.086
Signal three reported at Frank's Diner

435
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:50.466
off the main highway.

436
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:52.026
God damn it.

437
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.896
Any unit available?

438
00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.626
Corey. you in that spare yet?

439
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:58.966
I'm on it.

440
00:44:59.050 --> 00:44:59.850
Shit.

441
00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:13.306
I need some air.

442
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:15.236
You OK?

443
00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.656
Just starting to feel a little trapped.

444
00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:22.956
I've never been in a
situation like this before.

445
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.696
You?

446
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.716
Me?

447
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.516
Yeah.

448
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.946
I mean. you seem to know what
you're doing with all this.

449
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.786
I'm just a little more
objective right now is all.

450
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:34.310
You're the one in the hot seat.

451
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.746
And what's your name anyway?

452
00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:45.056
How about I tell you when
we get to where we're going?

453
00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.645
You're one strange girl.

454
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.610
We're not going to make it
to Abbeville tonight. are we?

455
00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:06.556
Stranger and stranger.

456
00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.176
You don't smoke?

457
00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.346
Not that stuff. not regular.

458
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:13.420
I just need to relax.

459
00:46:15.615 --> 00:46:16.415
Please?

460
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:23.336
Seriously. it's really good stuff.

461
00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.220
You'll like it.

462
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:27.346
Right?

463
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:28.230
See?

464
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:31.050
Go ahead.

465
00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:38.690
Thanks.

466
00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.666
Oh. no.

467
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:43.466
Oh.

468
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:44.350
Shit.

469
00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.136
Excuse my language.

470
00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.156
That is just my luck.

471
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.040
Oh.

472
00:46:56.145 --> 00:46:57.770
I probably should have tossed that too.

473
00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:07.456
Well. you were right.

474
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.706
It was pretty good.

475
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:11.146
Yeah?

476
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:12.145
Glad you think so.

477
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.050
At least one of us can relax.

478
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.636
It's got lights.

479
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.790
Ready to do this again if we have to?

480
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.701
I don't know.

481
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:05.350
Oh.

482
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:19.562
What's wrong?

483
00:48:19.646 --> 00:48:20.890
What was that shit?

484
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.896
What. do you mean the J?

485
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.826
There's something in that.

486
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:29.960
I told you it was good.

487
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:34.292
What is it?

488
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:51.294
Sleep tight.

489
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:20.186
You in that spare unit yet?

490
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:22.916
Back in business.

491
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.316
Meet me down at the end of Bright Springs.

492
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.626
The fishing hole?

493
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:30.101
I checked it once. but now that it's dark.

494
00:49:30.185 --> 00:49:32.053
I want another look.

495
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:56.510
Welcome back.

496
00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:02.746
What'd you give me?

497
00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:06.926
I told you I like a good road trip.

498
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:08.856
Where are we?

499
00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.176
Headed South again.

500
00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.096
I think.

501
00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.236
How long?

502
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.776
We might have passed that
area I was talking about.

503
00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:21.606
I told you we needed to pull
off the road for a while.

504
00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:23.476
I don't think we should stop.

505
00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.366
I thought about it.

506
00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:26.316
You don't even know where you're going.

507
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.966
I stopped for some directions.

508
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:30.466
Nowhere public.

509
00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:32.200
Just a little place had a light on.

510
00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:39.372
I get the feeling. no matter what happens.

511
00:51:39.456 --> 00:51:43.636
I don't think I'm going to
get where I'm going with you.

512
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:47.386
Don't worry about it.
the paranoia is temporary.

513
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:49.676
Oh. that wasn't normal stuff.

514
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.046
What was that shit?

515
00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:52.126
Don't get upset.

516
00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:55.126
Some people just have a weak constitution.

517
00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:57.886
I don't have a weak anything.

518
00:51:57.970 --> 00:51:59.756
OK.

519
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.586
What's funny?

520
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:03.126
Nothing.

521
00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:04.020
Nothing's funny.

522
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.966
Are you messing with me or what?

523
00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:12.946
What's your deal?

524
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:14.326
Chill out.

525
00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:15.736
Why are you going all hostile?

526
00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.046
You think this is hostile?

527
00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:19.066
Yes.

528
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:21.736
Hostile is giving me shit
that knocks me on my ass.

529
00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:22.696
Stop yelling.

530
00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.856
Hostile is laughing in my face.

531
00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:27.196
Why are you being such a freak?

532
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.836
What did you call me?

533
00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.936
This ride is so over.

534
00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:35.456
Oh. no you don't.

535
00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.410
Oh. God. no.

536
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.076
That's it.

537
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:40.876
That's it.

538
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.046
Easy.

539
00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:44.356
On the wheel.

540
00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.316
Freak. huh?

541
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.200
Huh?

542
00:52:48.955 --> 00:52:50.116
I knew it.

543
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.466
You know. I tried.

544
00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:54.166
I've been trying.

545
00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:56.686
Thought I was finished.
thought I could move on.

546
00:52:56.770 --> 00:53:00.076
I actually thought for once. for once.

547
00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.926
I found someone I could talk to.

548
00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:06.376
Someone I could trust.

549
00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:07.660
But you're all the same.

550
00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:14.375
I said on the wheel.

551
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:26.570
Why'd you have to be like this?

552
00:53:35.315 --> 00:53:36.115
Ow!

553
00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.776
Way wrong move.

554
00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:45.976
It's OK.

555
00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:46.860
OK.

556
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:52.500
My road.

557
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.970
No.

558
00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:19.858
No.

559
00:54:19.942 --> 00:54:20.742
Stop.

560
00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:24.960
No.

561
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.356
Get away from me.

562
00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:31.240
Drop the knife.

563
00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:39.156
You OK?

564
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.296
I don't know.

565
00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.790
You drop that knife. boy.

566
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:49.830
You got about two seconds.

567
00:54:53.415 --> 00:54:54.215
I got help coming.

568
00:55:24.685 --> 00:55:26.060
You go with that other officer.

569
00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:41.416
Well. well. sure thought better
than to come into this county

570
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:44.398
looking for trouble.

571
00:55:44.482 --> 00:55:45.940
We got some business to talk about.

572
00:55:57.810 --> 00:56:00.189
Got a first aid kit at the station.

573
00:56:00.273 --> 00:56:02.565
We'll get your leg dressed.
and you can get cleaned up.

574
00:56:07.963 --> 00:56:09.505
You have any family that we can call?

575
00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:22.951
It's all right.

576
00:56:23.035 --> 00:56:23.835
We're not far.

577
00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:40.346
Thought you had another one. didn't you?

578
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:43.926
Pretty young girl. innocent. and alone.

579
00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:47.746
Where'd you pick her up?

580
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:51.246
She picked me up.

581
00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:55.926
Well. your chapter is over. friend.

582
00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:59.391
I don't see any light in your future.

583
00:56:59.475 --> 00:57:03.966
But. I'll give you a
chance to tell me a story.

584
00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:48.371
Who knows. I might like it.

585
00:57:48.455 --> 00:57:50.826
Go ahead and get started.
if you haven't already.

586
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:51.846
You know where we'll be.

587
00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:52.770
Yes. sir.

588
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:06.406
Fix you right up.

589
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:08.486
Be right back.

590
00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:09.776
Make yourself at home.

591
00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:11.675
Can you at least take these off now?

592
00:58:19.235 --> 00:58:20.990
I'm going to need to get at that cut.

593
00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:57.846
Finding that necessary?

594
00:58:57.930 --> 00:59:01.140
Just. uh. making our
guest more comfortable.

595
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:23.825
Bring back any memories?

596
00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.996
Should it?

597
00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.006
I warned you about that smart mouth.

598
00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:33.936
You charging me with something?

599
00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.926
How about assault with a deadly weapon?

600
00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:38.586
Look. she's the one who picked me up. OK?

601
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:41.727
What about this. huh?

602
00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:44.216
I ain't got a right to defend myself?

603
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:45.456
Defend yourself.

604
00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.256
Yeah.

605
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:48.626
Yeah. we got into it. sure.

606
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:50.771
I don't know what her problem was.

607
00:59:50.855 --> 00:59:53.582
You know how women can be.

608
00:59:53.666 --> 00:59:56.616
You expecting me to believe that?

609
00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:58.126
Huh?

610
00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:00.106
Pretty young girl like that with no ties

611
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:03.616
to the community picking
up a dirtbag drifter.

612
01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.696
Come on.

613
01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.755
She drugged me.

614
01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:22.800
You look better.

615
01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:31.166
You look like you feel better. I mean.

616
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:34.076
We got some coffee. if you want it?

617
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.590
I don't drink it.

618
01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.706
Why don't you start from the beginning?

619
01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:16.225
When did you first come
in contact with this guy?

620
01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:20.989
Let me explain something to you.

621
01:01:21.073 --> 01:01:22.906
I've been cleaning up
bodies along these roads

622
01:01:22.990 --> 01:01:25.066
for four long years.

623
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:30.106
Never found a fingerprint or any
other real evidence in a one.

624
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:34.871
But with some of them.
recently. there was a pattern.

625
01:01:34.955 --> 01:01:35.755
An MO.

626
01:01:40.962 --> 01:01:42.295
You know what I'm talking about?

627
01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:48.786
A blade.

628
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:51.279
Like a big old hunting
knife wreaking havoc.

629
01:01:51.363 --> 01:01:53.696
And now I got the weapon sitting
right on my desk in there

630
01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.616
dropped from your worthless.
wandering. trash hand.

631
01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.946
You've got all this wrong.

632
01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:02.306
That knife doesn't mean anything.

633
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:05.686
We just processed all the evidence.

634
01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:09.556
Those scenes are fresh.
only a few hours old.

635
01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.263
I might not can prove
what you've done before.

636
01:02:12.347 --> 01:02:14.055
but I can prove what you've done tonight.

637
01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:19.736
Yeah.

638
01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:22.526
I knew you'd make a mistake at some point.

639
01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:24.556
Too reckless.

640
01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.806
Too sloppy.

641
01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:28.966
Amateur from day one.

642
01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:30.026
This is ridiculous.

643
01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:32.386
I'm not going to be
railroaded into this bullshit.

644
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:35.466
I need my phone call.

645
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.160
Now. who the hell are you going to call?

646
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:50.346
Yeah. you've been real busy
these last couple of days.

647
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:52.296
I got a feeling we
won't get any more calls

648
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.486
now that we got you chained up.

649
01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:59.256
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

650
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.626
You damn sure know what I'm talking about.

651
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.126
How about the one at the diner?

652
01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:04.013
What?

653
01:03:04.097 --> 01:03:06.096
You must have been really
pissed at that old boy

654
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.236
with the beating he took.

655
01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.256
Listen--

656
01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:10.116
Crushed his windpipe. like it was nothing.

657
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.541
This is crazy.

658
01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:13.125
What about the ones in your trunk?

659
01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:23.023
You put your ass in that chair.
or I'll blast your vagrant

660
01:03:23.107 --> 01:03:24.190
brains all over that wall.

661
01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:34.550
I done told you. you picked
the wrong county. boy.

662
01:03:40.287 --> 01:03:42.536
I guess it wasn't the
smartest move I could have made.

663
01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:43.346
Yeah.

664
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:45.950
Didn't your daddy tell you
to never pick up strangers?

665
01:04:02.219 --> 01:04:07.320
If you could look this over. let
me know if I missed anything.

666
01:04:20.888 --> 01:04:22.430
My daddy taught me a lot of things.

667
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:28.226
He was a truck driver.

668
01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:30.060
He used to take me with him on every trip.

669
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.170
We met a lot of people.

670
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.990
Yeah. he taught me good.

671
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:51.416
And then his friends taught me. and then.

672
01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:58.431
strangers. over and over again.

673
01:04:58.515 --> 01:04:59.315
Until--

674
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:20.766
Oh.

675
01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:21.796
Oh.

676
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.680
Oh.

677
01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.556
Ow.

678
01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:33.440
Ow.

679
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:44.400
Ooh. those wheels are spinning.

680
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:48.955
What is this?

681
01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.106
This?

682
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:55.390
This is the end of the line.

683
01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.626
No.

684
01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:00.646
Hands out.

685
01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:02.056
Hands out now.

686
01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:02.950
Get them out.

687
01:06:06.149 --> 01:06:10.006
You try any sit like
that. if you try anything.

688
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:12.476
I'll skin you alive
before I give it to you.

689
01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.435
You hear me?

690
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.580
I'd like to file a complaint.

691
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:32.770
I've never had one fight like you before.

692
01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.276
You like that. huh?

693
01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.776
Yeah.

694
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:39.886
Yeah?

695
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:41.296
Yeah.

696
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.336
Yeah?

697
01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.136
Oh.

698
01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:44.020
Oh.

699
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.246
These are your victims.

700
01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:01.046
Not all of them.

701
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:05.060
Besides. they'll all be
yours when we're done here.

702
01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:12.906
You don't go hunting in
another man's territory.

703
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:16.196
Now we got no record of you anywhere.

704
01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.296
That makes it all the easier.

705
01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.030
No record of your girlfriend either.

706
01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:23.680
You picked a good one.

707
01:07:31.363 --> 01:07:32.163
Oh.

708
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:40.346
That's right.

709
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:45.836
We're going to erase you and no
one will ever know different.

710
01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.425
One less piece of garbage
for society to smell.

711
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.116
Best part about it.
I get to close all

712
01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.415
my open cases with your name.

713
01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:02.699
Now don't get all riled up just yet.

714
01:08:02.783 --> 01:08:03.950
We'll finish with her first.

715
01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.380
No.

716
01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.556
Come out. girl.

717
01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.525
Your daddy didn't leave
you here for no reason.

718
01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:35.016
You're not going to waste my time.

719
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:35.969
Not again.

720
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.996
Ow.

721
01:09:02.434 --> 01:09:03.234
No.

722
01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:45.830
You sit tight.

723
01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:37.346
I was wrong about him. weren't I?

724
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.650
It was you handling all them people.

725
01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:52.416
Do it.

726
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.986
Oh. I will.

727
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:57.620
But first. we're going to dance.

728
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:01.100
Now turn around.

729
01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:09.366
Turn around or I'll put
a bullet in each knee

730
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:10.770
and one someplace special.

731
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:22.876
Yeah. I know who you are. and.
darling. I don't know what else

732
01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.046
you've been through in this
life to bring you to this.

733
01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.696
but I guarantee after tonight you

734
01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.340
never have to worry about it.

735
01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.896
Now get on the ground.

736
01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.766
Ga. ga. ga. ga.

737
01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:39.566
No.

738
01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:41.296
No.

739
01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.256
No.

740
01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.786
No.

741
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:44.896
What?

742
01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.216
I was ready.

743
01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.671
I had him.

744
01:12:47.755 --> 01:12:48.880
You had shit.

745
01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:54.295
He was mine.

746
01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.916
I knew there was something about you.

747
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.056
From the beginning. I knew.

748
01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:08.566
And I know you saw the same thing in me.

749
01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:11.686
or else I'd probably already be dead now.

750
01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:15.366
But none of that matters much now.

751
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:16.590
We got to get on the road.

752
01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:28.906
Look. I've done some bad things. but I

753
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:34.336
never did anybody didn't have
it coming in one way or another.

754
01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:37.036
You probably thought
like me you'd never end

755
01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.606
up on the other side of this.

756
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:41.806
I get it.

757
01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:44.326
Make them pay.

758
01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:45.766
Pay for the hurt.

759
01:13:45.850 --> 01:13:47.260
You don't know pain.

760
01:13:50.578 --> 01:13:52.536
I know we're going to
be in the deepest of shit

761
01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:54.300
unless we get the hell on our way now.

762
01:13:57.670 --> 01:14:01.276
We have to move quick if we
want to get out of this tonight.

763
01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.640
Need to clean up some
and make it look like--

764
01:14:25.003 --> 01:14:26.836
The little ones had
to sleep after suffering

765
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:33.656
with the monster in that house.
but not that whore of a mother.

766
01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.486
She went just like the rest.

767
01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:40.836
Because lying with pigs makes you a pig.

768
01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.770
and pigs are bred for slaughter.

769
01:14:46.728 --> 01:14:50.596
What the fuck?

770
01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:56.591
Harmless drifter down on
his luck with a sad story.

771
01:14:56.675 --> 01:14:57.475
Was I wrong.

772
01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:11.276
My father kept a little
book. an address book.

773
01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:15.656
with tiny shorthand notes.

774
01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.270
And I knew what the notes meant.

775
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:24.456
They were my last stop
before the ones in Abbeville.

776
01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:27.146
You bought them a few hours.

777
01:15:27.230 --> 01:15:27.946
OK.

778
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.746
OK.

779
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:31.536
Listen. we can still get out of this.

780
01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.376
I know the road.

781
01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.476
You think I don't?

782
01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:39.516
There are pigs all over
watching. luring. preying.

783
01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.406
Wait.

784
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:41.706
Wait.

785
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:44.512
You were dead the second
you pulled that knife on me.

786
01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:33.226
My road.

787
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:35.015
My car.

788
01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:06.947
Oh. god.

789
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:47.150
Geez.

790
01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:56.235
Psycho bitch.

791
01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.680
Whoa.

792
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:15.710
Ooh.

793
01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:25.226
No.

794
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:26.110
No!

795
01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:38.016
No.

796
01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.186
No.
No.

797
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.986
No.

798
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.870
Shit.

799
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:28.756
You have made the worst mistake

800
01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.730
of your miserable. little life.

801
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:37.146
You think you can hurt me?

802
01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:39.761
Wrong.

803
01:20:39.845 --> 01:20:40.645
You're wrong.

804
01:20:43.290 --> 01:20:46.456
No one can hurt me.

805
01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:47.455
Never again.

806
01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:53.756
I have the road now.

807
01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.786
And there's only room enough for one.

808
01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:32.135
You're gonna finally feel my blade.

809
01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.795
Make a wish.

810
01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.110
Oh.

811
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:17.306
An unidentified homeless drifter.

812
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:20.216
himself found deceased.
was picked up by police

813
01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.646
for questioning in the
infamous Highway Hunter

814
01:24:22.730 --> 01:24:24.926
killings. which have
terrorized the community

815
01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:26.576
over the past few years.

816
01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:29.546
The man's attempted escape
foiled by a confrontation

817
01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:32.936
with armed officers. also led
to the loss of our local law

818
01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.446
enforcement heroes. as well as
the unfortunate disappearance

819
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:40.346
of one more innocent victim.
an unidentified young woman

820
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:42.056
who was last seen with the killer

821
01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:45.446
and whose whereabouts
are at this time unknown.

822
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:48.536
A search is currently
underway to ensure her safety.

823
01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:50.756
and anyone with information regarding

824
01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.556
the woman in this artist's rendering

825
01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.686
is urged to call state police.

826
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:58.106
Authorities tell us it appears
that. although yesterday's

827
01:24:58.190 --> 01:25:01.136
and last night's events
are horrendous and tragic.

828
01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:04.196
they can officially close the
file on the Highway Hunter.

829
01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:06.386
Healing can begin for those affected

830
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:09.326
and for all the citizens of this county.

831
01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:10.556
Spring has sprung.

832
01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.346
Summer is here. and. baby.
it may be hot outside.

833
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:16.956
but the values are even hotter
inside at Venus Waterbeds.

834
01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.086
Because we've cleared
our warehouse and stacked

835
01:25:19.170 --> 01:25:21.889
the savings ceiling high
in all our showrooms.
