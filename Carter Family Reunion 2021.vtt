(mom chuckling)

to you little girl.

28
00:01:30.158 --> 00:01:31.658
- I almost had it.

29
00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:35.329
- Answer my question before
you almost get these belt.

30
00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.097
- Jeez. Okay.

31
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.432
No. I'm not planning
to go dancing like this

32
00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.201
at the family reunion.

33
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:42.402
- I knew that you heard me.

34
00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.904
- Love you.

35
00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:48.209
- No. no. no. no. You
already busted. (giggles)

36
00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:52.545
- Mommy. why do we always
have the family reunion here?

37
00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.881
Why can't we do it in Orlando

38
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.817
or some place fun?

39
00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.086
- Well. honey. we
create our own fun.

40
00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.289
Right?

41
00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.756
- Mom. I'm too old for
those kinds of answers.

42
00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:04.225
there has to be a real reason.

43
00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:07.060
- Oh. okay. Miss
lady. I see you.

44
00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:09.930
Look. there is a real reason.

45
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.499
but once we get to the house.

46
00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:13.100
I'll talk to you about it. okay?

47
00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.370
- Okay. Is my dad coming?

48
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.809
- I mean. I invited him.

49
00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:25.846
- You guys had an
argument. didn't you?

50
00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:28.115
- No. no. we didn't
have an argument.

51
00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:33.120
It's just adult relationships
are sometimes complicated.

52
00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:37.758
And your dad. he's a good man.

53
00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.727
- But you guys started
dating and everything.

54
00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:42.230
- Sydney. remember
I talked to you

55
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.565
about grown folks' business.

56
00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:46.534
Your dad. he's just busy.

57
00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:51.004
And right now he's
in Texas on business

58
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.706
and I left him a voicemail.

59
00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:58.712
Look. honey we both know that
your dad loves you very much.

60
00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:03.584
Right? So if he can
make it. he will. okay?

61
00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:06.153
- Okay.

62
00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:07.755
(country music)

63
00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:09.390
- [Erica] Hey Jeffrey see.

64
00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:16.597
I just want to apologize
for the other night.

65
00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:19.700
Things have just
been moving so fast

66
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.371
and I guess that. I've
been hurt a few times

67
00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.243
and I just don't wanna
rush into anything.

68
00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:32.846
(Erica sighing)

69
00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:35.683
Anyway. just come to
the family reunion

70
00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:40.421
and we'll figure
things out. Okay?

71
00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:44.124
See you soon.

72
00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:49.363
(upbeat music)

73
00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:01.108
- Where's all the people

74
00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:02.943
and the 4th of July decorations?

75
00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:07.315
- I honestly do not know.

76
00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:12.353
(phone ringing)

77
00:04:12.353 --> 00:04:14.822
Hey mom. where are you guys?

78
00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:16.790
You're already
supposed to be here.

79
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.560
Isn't dad bringing his
famous barbecue ribs?

80
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.396
- Sweetheart. we're not coming.

81
00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:25.299
- What? You're
joking (chuckling)

82
00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:26.567
- Hey sweetie.

83
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.669
- Hey dad. what is
mom talking about?

84
00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.938
- You remember when I
surprised your mother

85
00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:35.042
with that adventure trip.
in a Brazilian rainforest?

86
00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:37.277
- He surprised himself.

87
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.647
You know I don't like
camping and hiking

88
00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:40.981
and all that kind of stuff.

89
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:44.017
- I thought it would be fun

90
00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.487
and to expand our horizon.

91
00:04:46.487 --> 00:04:48.722
- Oh. you expanded
them all right.

92
00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:51.258
- Look. well you guys
got back last week.

93
00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:53.861
- We were supposed
to be back last week

94
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:57.331
but we are still
here stuck in Brazil.

95
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.199
- What? Okay.

96
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.168
You guys are joking
you're playing with me.

97
00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.403
You got me.

98
00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:05.305
- I'm afraid it's not
a joke sweetheart.

99
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.540
- Tell her the best part.

100
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.543
- Babe. we don't
need to worry her.

101
00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.078
- Worry me about what?

102
00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:12.513
- Tell her.

103
00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:14.715
- We caught the Dengue fever.

104
00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:16.717
- Dengue fever?

105
00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:19.186
- Yes. dengue fever.

106
00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:22.089
- It's a mosquito-borne
tropical disease.

107
00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.923
- It gives you a fever.

108
00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:24.057
yeah. I got that part.

109
00:05:25.393 --> 00:05:28.862
- Fever. diarrhea.
headache. pain in my neck.

110
00:05:29.797 --> 00:05:31.532
my back. my-

111
00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:33.433
- Babe.
- What?

112
00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:34.968
Or what?

113
00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:37.705
- So you're not coming to
the family reunion again?

114
00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:39.507
- Not unless we can go
back into a time machine

115
00:05:39.507 --> 00:05:41.442
and never go on this trip.

116
00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:45.178
- Oh. at least you
two are together.

117
00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.815
You wouldn't wanna have
Dengue fever alone.

118
00:05:47.815 --> 00:05:48.649
now would you?

119
00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.320
- I am. I guess you're right.

120
00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:57.925
- Sometimes I hate
how smart you are.

121
00:05:57.925 --> 00:05:59.126
(Erica sighing)

122
00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:01.061
- Well. I'm gonna
call you later. Okay?

123
00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:03.564
I gotta try to figure out
how to get some barbecue

124
00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:05.666
to this family reunion.

125
00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.468
I love you too.

126
00:06:07.468 --> 00:06:08.769
Bye bye.

127
00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:12.205
(phone beeping)

128
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.608
(phone ringing)

129
00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:17.845
Hello. Aunt Mae? No way.

130
00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:23.484
Yes it's today.

131
00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:28.489
Okay. okay. I am on my way.

132
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.060
(Erica sighing)

133
00:06:38.432 --> 00:06:39.800
- Where are we going. mommy?

134
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.602
- To get your aunt and uncle.

135
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.371
Oh. you know what?

136
00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:46.607
Before we go. there's
something I wanna show you.

137
00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:47.407
Okay?

138
00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:53.614
So you remember you asked me why

139
00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:55.949
we have our family
reunions here every year?

140
00:06:57.585 --> 00:06:59.753
Well. this is why.

141
00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.092
You see. when your
great-grandfather

142
00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:08.462
was released from prison.
for his wrongful conviction.

143
00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.701
He ended up suing the government

144
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:15.202
and he won a lot of money.

145
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.507
So he started his own
business with flipping homes

146
00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:24.512
and this is the first home
that he ever purchased.

147
00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:29.817
And that's why it's so
special to our family.

148
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.223
- [Sydney] Do you think
he'd be proud of us?

149
00:07:36.223 --> 00:07:38.859
- Yeah. I know that
he's proud of us

150
00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:41.595
and everything that
we've accomplished.

151
00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:42.896
You know. sometimes I stay here

152
00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:44.798
and I know that he's
watching over us.

153
00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:50.003
(gentle music)

154
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.546
(car engine revving)

155
00:07:59.547 --> 00:08:01.048
(horn honking)

156
00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:03.617
(gentle music)

157
00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:15.729
- Hey. what's up
brother? How you doing?

158
00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:18.331

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.101

- It's exactly like

178
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.106
Somebody please tell this man.

(clipper buzzing)

187
00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:05.005
- OG (indistinct).

188
00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:09.342
What's up with that meal
for another day man?

189
00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:11.645
- Just another
satisfied customer.

190
00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:14.114
- Obviously. but come on OG.

191
00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:16.383
She asked for you by name.

192
00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:19.687
Now keep it real. partner.
What's up. talk to me?

195
00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:26.293
"OG. I know you're a barber.

196
00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:27.961
"I get paid on the 15th.

197
00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:29.930
"Hook a sister up."

198
00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:33.667
- So did you hook her up?

199
00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:35.869
- I told her just like
I tell all the girls.

200
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.371
I don't work for charities.

201
00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:39.973
I don't work for free.
(broom sweeping)

202
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.175
And if you wanna
use these skills.

203
00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:43.877
you gotta pay me something.

204
00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:47.014
And I told her she
had three choices.

205
00:10:47.014 --> 00:10:49.082
She can give me some cash.

206
00:10:49.082 --> 00:10:50.417
- Well?

207
00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:51.752
- She can give me some grass.

208
00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:53.253
- Now you're talking.
(all chuckling)

209
00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:54.454
- Or that ass.

210
00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:57.024
(all laughing)

211
00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.895

OG. so you trying

(seat creaking)

214
00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:16.443
- She didn't have
no grass either.

215
00:11:16.443 --> 00:11:19.079
(all laughing)
- Oh.

216
00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:20.047

217
00:11:21.081 --> 00:11:23.116

218
00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:24.051
- So where you been. brother?

219
00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:25.385
We ain't seen you in a while.

220
00:11:25.385 --> 00:11:27.220
You doing the same cut thing?
(clipper buzzing)

221
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.122
- I've been traveling
a lot for work lately.

222
00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:30.357
- This ain't no
game. this for real.

223
00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:32.125
'cause you keep cutting
the back of your head.

224
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:33.326
it's gonna look
like hamburger meat.

225
00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:35.062
(all laughing)

226
00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:37.998
- [Barber] Oh. star

This for real.

229
00:11:41.902 --> 00:11:43.470
- Don't make me
laugh (chuckling).

230
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.238
- I like that commercial though.

231
00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:48.208
If Jeffrey can't get
you off. nobody can.

232
00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:51.278
- I use that in the
bed all the time.

233
00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:53.914
That's my sexy talk
with Ding (chuckling).

234
00:11:53.914 --> 00:11:55.382
(clipper buzzing)

235
00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:56.449
- Whatever works. bro.

236
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.154
- Wait. did you say your
girl's name was Ding?

237
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.457
- Yeah. What's wrong with that?

238
00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:06.059
I like Asian women.

239
00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:08.695
You see. fellas.

243
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.035
- What's her last name?

244
00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:16.203
You a Fed?

245
00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:18.105
You sound like a Fed right now.

You acting real feddy. partner.

247
00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:21.809

(clipper buzzing)

249
00:12:26.113 --> 00:12:29.817

253
00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:39.827

Where's the laughter

257
00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:45.432
It aint all that funny.

258
00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:46.433
Why you laughing?

259
00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:47.835

(clipper buzzing)

265
00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:00.513
- Just doing what I can.

So what you doing for the 4th?

268
00:13:03.683 --> 00:13:08.188

00:13:08.188 --> 00:13:09.990
- Hold on. hold on. daughter?

270
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.025
I didn't know you

- Me either.

273
00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:17.097
- Yeah. it was kind of
a surprise to me too.

274
00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:20.868
I had a one night stand
about nine years ago.

275
00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:24.204
yeah. she didn't
tell me about it.

276
00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:27.640
Then my daughter found
me on the internet.

277
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.809
So we've been playing
catch up ever since.

278
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.812
- Internet! What's
her family like?

279
00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.514
- Pretty cool actually.

280
00:13:34.514 --> 00:13:38.418
Very accomplished people.

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:39.752
the mom a stay at home mom.

282
00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:42.022
And then my daughter's
mother is an attorney.

283
00:13:42.022 --> 00:13:42.990
- Oh. wow. oh.

284
00:13:44.624 --> 00:13:46.326
- Can the mama cook?

285
00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:47.527
That's all I wanna know.

286
00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:49.396
(all chuckling)

287
00:13:49.396 --> 00:13:50.497
- Yeah. she could throw it out.

288
00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.365

00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:53.967

290
00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:55.468

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:56.436
- [Jeffrey] I guess.

292
00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:57.871

293
00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:00.207
- I got a couple of questions.

294
00:14:00.207 --> 00:14:01.008
- Okay.

295
00:14:01.942 --> 00:14:02.809
- Is she crazy?

296
00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:04.011
(all laughing)

297
00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:05.578
'Cause ain't nothing
like some crazy coochie.

298
00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:08.648
Don't sleep.

299
00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:09.716
- No. she's mad cool.

300
00:14:09.716 --> 00:14:11.919
(clippers buzzing)

301
00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:13.553
- You got a picture of her?

302
00:14:13.553 --> 00:14:16.489
(clippers buzzing)

303
00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:23.430
- [All] Damn!

304
00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:27.234
- Hey. she bad.

305
00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:29.136
- OG. what you do

306
00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:31.804
- Ooh! That girl got everything.

307
00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:34.374
(all laughing)

308
00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:38.912
- Yeah. she's pretty amazing?

309
00:14:38.912 --> 00:14:40.580
- So what you
waiting for hommie?

310
00:14:42.082 --> 00:14:45.518
- Nothing. She. she not
feeling me like that.

311
00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:47.587
I mean. I'm in her rotation.

312
00:14:47.587 --> 00:14:50.023
but she ain't taking me serious.

313
00:14:50.023 --> 00:14:52.125
- Come on. man be for real.

314
00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:54.461
She's a lawyer. you a lawyer.

315
00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:56.529
And obviously you
hooked on this woman.

316
00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:59.232
- At least the best part of her.

317
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.500
(all laughing)

318
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.202
- Like my granddaddy
used to tell me man.

319
00:15:03.103 --> 00:15:05.272
women they just like cars.

320
00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:11.411
When you rent them. you can
ride them however you want to.

321
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.880
But your ass gonna
pay a high price.

322
00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:18.518
And as soon as you get
used to it a little bit.

323
00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:21.621
try to take her right
back. you know what I mean?

324
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:22.622
But when you buy.

325
00:15:23.957 --> 00:15:26.093
now you get to ride
it whenever you want

326
00:15:26.093 --> 00:15:28.561
for a much lower price.

327
00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:33.200
But. you gotta get used to
those imperfections over time.

328
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.868
- Y'all broke asses probably
put it on little wait anyway.

329
00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.570
(all laughing)

330
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.838
- Look here. man.

331
00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:40.040
We've been in this
game a long time.

332
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.442
from thots all the
way back to skeezers.

333
00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.644
I mean. eventually you
gotta make a decision.

334
00:15:44.644 --> 00:15:46.913
You keep all that
banging and slanging.

335
00:15:46.913 --> 00:15:48.581
your dick gonna fall off.

336
00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:50.017
You know what I'm saying?

337
00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:52.452
You got a fine good looking
woman man. beautiful.

338
00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.587
voluptuous. scrumptious

339
00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:56.889
and she got a great
big old juicy booty.

340
00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:58.425
- Okay. okay. I get it.

341
00:15:58.425 --> 00:15:59.659
- But I mean. look here. man.

342
00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:01.294
She waited for a black
King to swoop down

343
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.230
and sweep her off her feet.

344
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.597
You see never
playing around. man.

345
00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:05.932
Unless this woman's
been living in a bubble.

346
00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:10.037
She done met 5011.
noncommittal. sorry. cheating.

347
00:16:10.037 --> 00:16:13.440
unemployed. emotionally
unavailable.

348
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.342
They all started out.

349
00:16:15.342 --> 00:16:16.576
just like you.

350
00:16:16.576 --> 00:16:19.179
Nice. She needed
a man to decide.

351
00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:21.181
You decide. and you
decide what you're gon' do

352
00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:23.283
for your family then you leave.

353
00:16:23.283 --> 00:16:24.851
A woman like that.

354
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:27.354
she got a deep bench.
man. look here.

355
00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:29.189
If you ain't. the dude
is going out there

356
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:32.959
and winning every day
and blowing that back out

357
00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:34.927
on a consistent basis.

358
00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:36.429
you're going to be
right back on the bench.

359
00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:37.897
Watch what I tell you.

360
00:16:37.897 --> 00:16:39.632
- Finally. It's not
that I can agree to.

361
00:16:39.632 --> 00:16:40.867
Amen to that.

362
00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:42.302
- Preach. Tell him.

363
00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:43.703
- He ain't lying.

364
00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:45.138
While we are going to have.

365
00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:48.508
booty shaking barbecue and
steal that girl right from you.

366
00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:51.111
(all laughing)

367
00:16:55.182 --> 00:16:57.750
(Mae giggling)

368
00:16:59.986 --> 00:17:01.088
- [Mae] Stop it.

369
00:17:01.088 --> 00:17:04.223
(indistinct)

370
00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:06.626
- I am ready to take off again.

371
00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:07.894
- Me too.

372
00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:09.061
(laughing)

373
00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:11.664
Stop it. you're nasty.

374
00:17:11.664 --> 00:17:14.767
(both laughing)

375
00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:17.770
So. where's my little Sydney?

376
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.472
- Actually. I left her
at a friend's house

377
00:17:19.472 --> 00:17:22.608
because I didn't want her to
see you two in this situation.

378
00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:25.011
- Erica. I love your hair.

379
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:27.280
Did you do something
different to it?

380
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.448
- I always do something
different to my hair.

381
00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:30.117
But thank you. Aunt Mae.

382
00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:34.621
- Erica. you don't seem
very happy to see us.

383
00:17:34.621 --> 00:17:36.689
- Well. Uncle Victor. I
thought I was picking you guys

384
00:17:36.689 --> 00:17:38.591
up from the airport.
not the police station.

385
00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:42.129
I mean. the mile high
club. guys. really?

386
00:17:42.129 --> 00:17:43.062
- Yes.

387
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:45.998
Well. Erica you know that

388
00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:50.703
you of all people already
know about birds and the bees.

389
00:17:50.703 --> 00:17:52.572
So I'll just tell you that.

390
00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:57.577
your Aunty Mae and I we just.
we got married so early.

391
00:17:58.311 --> 00:17:59.812
Directly out of college.

392
00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.681
We didn't have a chance
to do all the crazy things

393
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:05.218
that 20 something
year olds normally do.

394
00:18:05.218 --> 00:18:06.486
- Sure did.

395
00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:09.389
- To include having sex
in the airplane bathroom

396
00:18:09.389 --> 00:18:10.657
(both laughing)

397
00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:12.892
- You do know that's not
a thing anymore. right?

398
00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:14.161
- Well we made it.

399
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:17.564
- I made it a
thing again. right?

400
00:18:17.564 --> 00:18:21.534
- Yes. its amazing what you
can do in a small space.

401
00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:24.036
when you put your mind to it.

402
00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.205
- I enjoy hips.

403
00:18:25.205 --> 00:18:27.207
- Oh. love them hips baby.

404
00:18:27.207 --> 00:18:29.209
(both laugh)

405
00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:30.310
- Okay. okay.

406
00:18:31.344 --> 00:18:32.445
Can you pleas stop?

407
00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.382
- How do you think my
sister in-law made you?

408
00:18:35.382 --> 00:18:38.985
- Please. Aunt
Mae I. no. Please.

409
00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:41.488
- Okay baby girl.
we will behave.

410
00:18:41.488 --> 00:18:43.256
I promise.

411
00:18:43.256 --> 00:18:44.090
- Thank you.

412
00:18:45.525 --> 00:18:49.229
Did you even consider how
maybe this affects me?

413
00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:53.500
- Affects you.

414
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.303
- Considering you. excuse me.

415
00:18:56.303 --> 00:18:57.470
- [Erica] Yes.

416
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.638
- Did you even
consider us when you

417
00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.273
had a one night stand?

418
00:19:00.273 --> 00:19:01.974
- A unprotected one night stand.

419
00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.211
- Yeah. with Jeffrey Davidson?

420
00:19:04.211 --> 00:19:06.913
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you. did you?

421
00:19:06.913 --> 00:19:08.981
Exactly. I didn't think so.

422
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.083
I rest my case.

423
00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:14.421
Listen. baby girl. your
aunt and I love each other.

424
00:19:14.421 --> 00:19:16.022
- Yes we do. we do.

425
00:19:17.624 --> 00:19:21.561
- We had some fun.
we took a risk.

426
00:19:21.561 --> 00:19:22.462
We got caught.

427
00:19:22.462 --> 00:19:23.396
- [Mae] Yes we did.

428
00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.733
- But we lived to talk about it.

429
00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:28.735
- And you do know
that you guys would be

430
00:19:28.735 --> 00:19:30.870
in jail if weren't wealthy?

431
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.872
- And because we
know our rights.

432
00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:35.608
- And not everybody
has that privilege.

433
00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:39.712
- Well. that's why we are
so proud of our beautiful.

434
00:19:39.712 --> 00:19:44.717
intelligent and way too serious
freedom fighting attorneys.

435
00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:49.389
- Well. congratulations
you guys made the paper.

436
00:19:49.389 --> 00:19:50.323
- Oh! My goodness.

437
00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:53.226
- Are you kidding me. what?

438
00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:56.896
The paper? Get out.
Let me read this.

439
00:19:56.896 --> 00:19:58.164
- Look at this.

440
00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:02.502
- Oh. yeah. (chuckles)

441
00:20:02.502 --> 00:20:05.137
Love is in the air.

442
00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:07.974
- A couple in their
sixties as being hailed

443
00:20:07.974 --> 00:20:12.144
as an example of the love
that stands the test of time.

444
00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:14.447
Mae and Victor Carter-
- That's us.

445
00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.917
Were arrested this morning when

446
00:20:17.917 --> 00:20:21.454
their plane touched down at
Richmond International Airport.

447
00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:23.356
The couple was
charged with violation

448
00:20:23.356 --> 00:20:28.361
of FAA regulations related to
the use of airplane lavatory.

449
00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:30.830
(Both laugh)

450
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.233
After a flight attendant
caught them having sex.

451
00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.902
The couple spent
one night in jail

452
00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:37.169
and the charges were dropped

453
00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:40.673
for lack of sufficient
evidence. (mumbles)

454
00:20:40.673 --> 00:20:43.910
However. their lesson
to society is clear.

455
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.378
Love is in the air.

456
00:20:45.378 --> 00:20:48.581
- In the air. oh. my goodness.

457
00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:50.182
- Yeah. And you know.
if you guys were poor.

458
00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:53.219
you would be on the way
to prison right now.

459
00:20:54.687 --> 00:20:58.925
- See. you and your brother
created that monster.

460
00:20:58.925 --> 00:20:59.726
- Monster?

461
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.894
- Listen. baby girl.

462
00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:05.298
you know I am so proud

463
00:21:05.298 --> 00:21:08.200
and happy that you
became an attorney.

464
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.337
Just like your uncle Vic.

465
00:21:10.337 --> 00:21:11.771
And you know the whole
family is proud of you.

466
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.373
- Oh. yes.

467
00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:14.374
- But.

468
00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:15.408
- Here we go.

469
00:21:15.408 --> 00:21:16.909
- [Vic] Yes.

470
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:19.612
Do you have the answers to all
the problems in the country?

471
00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.147
- No.

472
00:21:21.147 --> 00:21:23.316
- Because if you do. then you
don't need to be an attorney.

473
00:21:23.316 --> 00:21:25.818
You need to be the
President. And I mean that.

474
00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:30.122
Listen. Nobody has all
the answers. I don't.

475
00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:33.693
But I live by
three simple rules.

476
00:21:33.693 --> 00:21:34.661
- Yes he does.

477
00:21:34.661 --> 00:21:38.565
- Please my God. please my wife.

478
00:21:38.565 --> 00:21:40.700
And support my community.

479
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.337
And on that plane. I
was pleasing my wife.

480
00:21:44.337 --> 00:21:45.304
Were you pleased. baby?

481
00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:46.906
- Woo. baby. I was so pleased.

482
00:21:46.906 --> 00:21:48.408
- That's right. you know we are.

483
00:21:48.408 --> 00:21:51.778
- Okay. okay. you know
what? You guys win. okay?

484
00:21:51.778 --> 00:21:54.981
But can you please just keep
it together (indistinct)

485
00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:55.815
Please?

486
00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:56.783
- [Mae] All right. deal.

487
00:21:56.783 --> 00:21:58.651
- [Vic] Deal. deal.

488
00:21:58.651 --> 00:21:59.986
- Thank you.

489
00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:04.557
- So. how's your
boyfriend/baby's father doing?

490
00:22:07.093 --> 00:22:08.528
- Fine.

491
00:22:08.528 --> 00:22:10.597
but he's not my boyfriend
we're just friends.

492
00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:15.101
- What. just friends?

493
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:16.102
- Yes.

494
00:22:16.102 --> 00:22:18.070
- [Vic] Just friends?
- Yes.

495
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.005
- Lets see.

496
00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:20.407
He is your baby's father.

497
00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:25.144
He's a respected attorney
in the community.

498
00:22:25.144 --> 00:22:27.013
He's great with Sydney.
- Yes.

499
00:22:27.013 --> 00:22:28.515
- And every time I see him

500
00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:31.317
he's treating you like.
like some precious jewel.

501
00:22:31.317 --> 00:22:32.485
Am I missing something?

502
00:22:33.786 --> 00:22:36.355
- No. you've pretty
much nailed it.

503
00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:37.289
- You right.

504
00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:38.491
- Then whats the problem Erica?

505
00:22:38.491 --> 00:22:40.126
- I just don't wanna
make the wrong decision.

506
00:22:40.126 --> 00:22:42.462
People have a tendency
to change up on you

507
00:22:42.462 --> 00:22:44.864
and that's not what I want.

508
00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:47.199
- Well. are you
seeing someone else?

509
00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:48.868
- No way. no thanks.

510
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.606
- Baby girl. take it from me.
leave your past behind you

511
00:22:53.606 --> 00:22:55.442
or your future will pass you by.

512
00:22:55.442 --> 00:22:56.709
- Right.

513
00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:58.110
- Don't you mean fly by?

514
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.978
- oh. yes fly by.

515
00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.881
(Both laugh)

516
00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:03.650
That's right. fly by.

517
00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.151
- Oh man.

518
00:23:05.151 --> 00:23:08.087
I can't wait to have some
of my brothers barbecue.

519
00:23:08.087 --> 00:23:09.355
- Angela's coconut cake.

520
00:23:09.355 --> 00:23:10.890
- Yeah.
- Woo!

521
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.661
- Yeah. so about that.

522
00:23:14.661 --> 00:23:16.996
We'll talk about that later.

523
00:23:18.531 --> 00:23:23.536
- [Mae] Ooh.

524
00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:25.772
(bright music)

525
00:23:25.772 --> 00:23:27.406
- [Benita] Thank you for
calling Youfly Airlines.

526
00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:28.641
My name is Benita.

527
00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:31.043
How can i brighten
your day today?

528
00:23:31.043 --> 00:23:32.479
- Hi. Benita.

529
00:23:32.479 --> 00:23:34.046
I'm trying to get a
flight from El Paso. Texas

530
00:23:34.046 --> 00:23:36.849
to Williamsburg. Virginia.
first thing tomorrow morning.

531
00:23:37.984 --> 00:23:40.553
- [Benita] And would
that brighten your day?

532
00:23:40.553 --> 00:23:42.021
- Huh?

533
00:23:42.021 --> 00:23:44.624
- [Benita] Would it brighten
your day if I book you a flight

and there is a weather issue

548
00:24:25.231 --> 00:24:27.634
in Atlanta that caused
a lot of delays.

549
00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:31.804
None of the airlines
can sell any new flights

550
00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:34.674
to Williamsburg until
we get everyone already

551

553
00:24:41.581 --> 00:24:43.049

554
00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:44.751
- [Benita] Atlanta.

555
00:24:44.751 --> 00:24:48.354
- Atlanta? That's like 10
hours drive from Williamsburg.

556
00:24:48.354 --> 00:24:51.057

Like I said. it's beautiful.

563
00:25:04.136 --> 00:25:05.337
- Yeah. You said that.

564
00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:06.606
- [Benita] They

565
00:25:06.606 --> 00:25:08.040
You can pick me up some.

566
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.842

567
00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:14.380
- [Benita] Yes. they did
have this weather issue.

568
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.548
- What is the weather issue?

569
00:25:15.548 --> 00:25:17.750
You know what?
Don't even tell me.

570
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.053
You ain't know about this

00:26:16.008 --> 00:26:17.844
- Family. I'm glad
you all are here.

585
00:26:17.844 --> 00:26:19.712
We've got a bit of a situation.

586
00:26:19.712 --> 00:26:23.349
Well. my brother. Aaron
and his wife are stuck

587
00:26:23.349 --> 00:26:25.785

- Brazil?

589
00:26:26.619 --> 00:26:28.120
- Yes. Brazil.

590
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.591
So. normally they host this
event. but it's up to us now.

591
00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:35.394
So. we've got to decorate.

592
00:26:35.394 --> 00:26:37.830
cook everything
in under two hours

593
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.931
before everybody gets here.

594
00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:39.866
- Woo!

595
00:26:39.866 --> 00:26:41.400

Erica you can come too.

599
00:26:49.475 --> 00:26:51.343
- See you wrong

600
00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:52.879
That's okay.

601
00:26:52.879 --> 00:26:55.614
- Well. the potato salad you
made the last time was hmm.

602
00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:56.582
- You know what?

603
00:26:56.582 --> 00:26:58.550
My man loves my potato salad.

604
00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.585
- Ooh!

605
00:26:59.585 --> 00:27:00.486

606
00:27:00.486 --> 00:27:01.888

607
00:27:01.888 --> 00:27:04.290
(indistinct)

608
00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:12.531
- Baby. what's part
where all the women leave

609
00:27:12.531 --> 00:27:13.766
and go to the kitchen
and leave the man.

610
00:27:13.766 --> 00:27:15.234
the fourth bond over manship?

611
00:27:16.202 --> 00:27:18.270
- Well. can you handle it?

612
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.107
- B. can you give
the man some space?

613
00:27:22.541 --> 00:27:26.578
I need to educate him on the
ways of the Carter family.

614
00:27:27.747 --> 00:27:30.316
- And see now that's
what I was afraid of.

615
00:27:30.316 --> 00:27:31.884
- So Ellie actually
went to Brazil.

616
00:27:31.884 --> 00:27:33.920
- Yeah.
- You ever been?

617
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.889
- Bruh. (laughs)
have I ever been?

618
00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:38.257
Let me tell you a story.

619
00:27:38.257 --> 00:27:39.759
- No you don't. No you don't.

620
00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:42.895
Don't be telling him none
of your skanky ass nasty

621
00:27:42.895 --> 00:27:43.963
sex stories.

622
00:27:43.963 --> 00:27:45.898
Don't be telling him that.

623
00:27:51.103 --> 00:27:52.304
- So okay.

624
00:27:52.304 --> 00:27:55.341
So this one time
you understand. so.

625
00:27:57.877 --> 00:28:00.412
(upbeat music)

626
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:04.383
- Yes.

627
00:28:07.086 --> 00:28:10.356
- Let me have a large coffee.

628
00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:11.190
- Flavor?

629
00:28:12.591 --> 00:28:16.062
- No. no flavor.
Just regular coffee.

630
00:28:16.062 --> 00:28:19.031
- Sir We don't make
regular coffee here.

631
00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:21.400
Our coffee comes from
a special blend of made

632
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.936
out of special beans that
make it the best coffee

633
00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:25.004
on this earth.

634
00:28:26.739 --> 00:28:31.744
- Well. okay. Give
me one of those then.

635
00:28:32.344 --> 00:28:33.212
- One of what?

636
00:28:34.914 --> 00:28:37.249
- The special thing for the.

637
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.553
- Try the Japanese (indistinct).
you're driving. right?

638
00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:42.621
- Whoa!

639
00:28:42.621 --> 00:28:45.657
First of all. personal space.

640
00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:49.728
Second of all. that sounds
like liquid cocaine.

641
00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:50.763
- Tastes like it too.

642
00:28:52.264 --> 00:28:54.801
- How do you know what
cocaine tastes like?

643
00:28:54.801 --> 00:28:57.036
- Just try it. its really good.

644
00:28:57.036 --> 00:28:57.870
- Told you.

645
00:29:00.106 --> 00:29:02.975
- Look. man and woman.

646
00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.413
I appreciate your
concern. but I got this.

647
00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:10.482
- Okay and just doubt.

648
00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:11.918
- You cannot help some people.

649
00:29:11.918 --> 00:29:13.585
- Its actually a
really good choice.

650
00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:14.553
- See?

651
00:29:14.553 --> 00:29:15.687
- Told you.
- Mm-hmm.

652
00:29:16.956 --> 00:29:21.961
- Everybody. I can
choose my own coffee.

653
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.466
- Pick it already. you're
giving us caffeine anxiety.

654
00:29:27.466 --> 00:29:30.002
- Pretty sure
that's not a thing.

655
00:29:30.002 --> 00:29:33.739
Okay. Let me get pinochet.

656
00:29:33.739 --> 00:29:36.708
(people yelling)

657
00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:38.077
- Now you really messed up.

658
00:29:41.848 --> 00:29:43.582
What's wrong with the pinochet?

659
00:29:43.582 --> 00:29:45.818
(indistinct chatter)

660
00:29:45.818 --> 00:29:47.486
- The coffee is actually named

661
00:29:47.486 --> 00:29:50.923
after former President
Jose Ramon Pinochet.

662
00:29:50.923 --> 00:29:52.358
the one who invented the beans.

663
00:29:52.358 --> 00:29:53.459
They come from Chile.

664
00:29:55.327 --> 00:29:57.763
(indistinct)

665
00:30:00.933 --> 00:30:03.702
- Okay. So. all right.

666
00:30:03.702 --> 00:30:06.172
Give me that jack off-

667
00:30:07.373 --> 00:30:08.207
- [All] Jack and the beanstalk.

668
00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:17.016
- That. yeah. The jack
and the beanstalk thing.

669
00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:19.085
Made from the beans.

670
00:30:20.052 --> 00:30:23.722
that are made from angel turds.

671
00:30:23.722 --> 00:30:26.458
That thing. please
and thank you.

672
00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:28.861
- You don't have to be
sarcastic. you know?

673
00:30:28.861 --> 00:30:30.696
- Yeah whatever the
cap (indistinct).

674
00:30:31.697 --> 00:30:33.265
- That'll be 19.75.

675
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.002
- Beg your pardon?

676
00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:41.974
No I asked for one coffee.

677
00:30:41.974 --> 00:30:44.143
- I gave you one coffee.

678
00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:48.147
- One coffee cost
almost 20 dollars?

679
00:30:49.148 --> 00:30:50.582
- It's totally worth. bro.

680
00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:54.420
- Dude. can you not?
- Trying to help.

681
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.288
- You already said that.

682
00:30:56.288 --> 00:30:58.524
- How would you like to
pay? Debit or credit?

683
00:31:00.292 --> 00:31:02.294
- Debit.

684
00:31:02.294 --> 00:31:03.963
- US debit or Visa debit?

685
00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:10.536
- Well. its a Visa card
so I guess Visa debit.

686
00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:12.438
I don't know. what's
the difference?

687
00:31:12.438 --> 00:31:14.040
- Visa debit is credit.

688
00:31:16.642 --> 00:31:18.577
- Then why do they
call it visa debit?

689
00:31:18.577 --> 00:31:20.446
- I don't know. Why
didn't you ask them?

690
00:31:22.048 --> 00:31:23.315
- Maybe I will.

691
00:31:23.315 --> 00:31:25.517
- What's wrong with
paying with credit?

692
00:31:25.517 --> 00:31:26.685
- Credit cost more.

693
00:31:26.685 --> 00:31:27.920
- Not if you have good credit.

694
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.255
- Even if you...

695
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.446
- Hey. can I get a
jack and the beanstalk?

696
00:31:54.446 --> 00:31:56.148
- US debit or Visa card?

697
00:31:56.148 --> 00:31:58.684
(upbeat music)

698
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:12.598
- Don't you have
something for me?

699
00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:17.203
Where did you get that from?

700
00:32:20.406 --> 00:32:24.010
(cigarette lighter firing)

701
00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:30.116
Wow. that's the real thing. huh?

702
00:32:32.251 --> 00:32:34.086
What's it called. man?

703
00:32:34.086 --> 00:32:36.522
- Don't worry about all that.

704
00:32:38.857 --> 00:32:41.327
- At least you can
tell the name of it.

705
00:32:41.327 --> 00:32:42.161
- Who dat?

706
00:32:43.362 --> 00:32:44.863
- Who dat where?

707
00:32:44.863 --> 00:32:45.931
- Where what?

708
00:32:45.931 --> 00:32:47.433
- What do you mean where what?

709
00:32:47.433 --> 00:32:48.834
- Are you fucked up already?

710
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:51.403

- I gotta ask.

741
00:34:33.339 --> 00:34:34.672
- Did I stutter?

742
00:34:35.806 --> 00:34:37.909
- What happened to-
- Don't say it.

743
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.146

- Look. you can't talk to
me who can you talk to. bro?

746
00:34:49.321 --> 00:34:51.157
- She wasn't who
thought she was.

747
00:34:52.658 --> 00:34:55.994
- I got that apparently.
but what about the baby?

748
00:34:57.729 --> 00:34:59.631
- She told me it wasn't mine.

749
00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:02.834
- Damn. bro. Hey
look. its all good.

750
00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.336
You got mad friends

751
00:35:04.336 --> 00:35:07.139

ready to line your pockets

752
00:35:07.139 --> 00:35:08.674

753
00:35:08.674 --> 00:35:10.642
- I'm not Worried about that.

754
00:35:10.642 --> 00:35:12.544
The main thing is
that I went back

755
00:35:12.544 --> 00:35:16.415
to med school because I
thought she was having my baby.

756
00:35:16.415 --> 00:35:19.385
And of course my father wants
me to follow through with it.

757
00:35:20.486 --> 00:35:22.388
But none of them single

758
00:35:23.889 --> 00:35:24.990
I'm just trying to
find my motivation.

759
00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:27.092
You know what I'm saying?

760
00:35:27.092 --> 00:35:29.461
- You know what you
sound like right now?

761
00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:31.730
Like a spoiled little
biatch right now.

762
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:32.831
- Is that your pep talk?

763
00:35:32.831 --> 00:35:35.267

767
00:35:44.243 --> 00:35:47.279
It wasn't something that
we would talk about.

768
00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:49.915
We didn't have any options.

769
00:35:49.915 --> 00:35:51.417
We had to survive. bro.

770
00:35:51.417 --> 00:35:53.285

00:36:03.962 --> 00:36:07.065
Who cares? Just see
where it all leads.

00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:31.009
In the middle of nowhere.
sitting in my car

894
00:43:31.009 --> 00:43:33.111

895
00:43:35.413 --> 00:43:36.381

foreign language).

896
00:43:37.883 --> 00:43:39.150

I got in a little argument
with my boyfriend.

901
00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:53.331
He kicked me out of the car.

902
00:43:56.267 --> 00:43:57.435
- That's a asshole move.

903
00:43:59.337 --> 00:44:01.840
- You have no idea how
right you are. Jeffrey.

904
00:44:05.877 --> 00:44:10.448
- All right. let me just
fill up the gas tank

905
00:44:10.448 --> 00:44:12.851
and then I'll take you
wherever you wanna go.

00:44:26.231 --> 00:44:29.000
(birds chirping)

907
00:44:51.923 --> 00:44:56.928

908
00:44:58.329 --> 00:45:00.732
- Yeah. Actually. I'm
trying to get to her now.

909
00:45:02.067 --> 00:45:03.869
It's been a hell of a day.

910
00:45:03.869 --> 00:45:04.970
- She's a lucky girl.

911
00:45:09.107 --> 00:45:12.911
- Hey. is that your
boyfriend back there

912
00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:16.347
coming up the road?

913
00:45:19.751 --> 00:45:21.052
Is your boyfriend jealous?

914
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.524
- He's very jealous
and aggressive.

915
00:45:26.524 --> 00:45:30.095
- Is that him? Is that him?

916
00:45:34.699 --> 00:45:36.567
- No. it's just my blunt driver.

917
00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:37.936
(exhales)

918
00:45:37.936 --> 00:45:39.670

(car engine revving)

923
00:46:17.008 --> 00:46:18.076

(car engine revving)

929
00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:11.662
(engine backfires)

930
00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:12.497
Come on.

931
00:47:21.106 --> 00:47:23.708
(gentle music)

932
00:47:27.145 --> 00:47:30.281
Come on. man. Good job. Jeffrey.

933
00:47:37.923 --> 00:47:41.927
You had to have a hot
car with no spare.

934
00:47:46.331 --> 00:47:48.934
Okay. okay. It's
4th of July weekend.

935
00:47:48.934 --> 00:47:50.835
I will find a tow company.

936
00:47:50.835 --> 00:47:52.737
4th of July weekend.
I can do this.

937
00:47:56.908 --> 00:47:58.843
You ain't gon' keep
me from my woman.

938
00:47:58.843 --> 00:48:00.311
That's what you ain't gon' do.

939
00:48:12.457 --> 00:48:15.860
- Cuz. I miss my phone already.

940
00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.062
- Tell me about it.

941
00:48:17.062 --> 00:48:19.830
Who made that no
phone rule anyway...

942
00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:21.866
- I'm pretty sure it
was Grandpa Arrow.

943
00:48:21.866 --> 00:48:23.768
Something about smart phones.

944
00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:26.504
Take the union out
of family reunion.

945
00:48:26.504 --> 00:48:28.806

00:48:28.806 --> 00:48:30.575
- Well. on the bright side.

947
00:48:30.575 --> 00:48:33.011
I think we got some great
fireworks this year.

948
00:48:33.011 --> 00:48:35.246
We're not allowed to open
them until nightfall.

949
00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:38.216
- Aren't you getting tired
of following the rules?

950
00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:39.384
- How we open the box?

951
00:48:39.384 --> 00:48:40.952

952
00:48:40.952 --> 00:48:41.786

953
00:48:45.056 --> 00:48:48.726
Yo. They got some caps.

954
00:48:48.726 --> 00:48:50.028
- What are caps?

955
00:48:50.028 --> 00:48:51.829
- You've never used caps?

956
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:54.399
My dad used to play with
these all the time with me.

957
00:48:54.399 --> 00:48:57.302
Usually. there's a cap
gun or something around.

958
00:48:58.303 --> 00:48:59.870
I don't see one.

959
00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.472
Okay. I'll just use a lighter.

960
00:49:04.442 --> 00:49:05.676
These should explode.

961
00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:06.711
So like. you might
wanna step back.

962
00:49:16.854 --> 00:49:21.726
What? Really? Nothing. (exhales)

963
00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:27.332
- Wait. You here something?

964
00:49:30.535 --> 00:49:33.804

965
00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:38.176

966
00:49:39.244 --> 00:49:40.511

968
00:49:45.483 --> 00:49:46.851
You need to thank your sister.

969
00:49:46.851 --> 00:49:48.519
If it wasn't for her.
we wouldn't be here

970
00:49:48.519 --> 00:49:49.487

00:50:00.565 --> 00:50:01.766
- Okay.

977
00:50:01.766 --> 00:50:02.867
Have you seen a little baby.

978
00:50:02.867 --> 00:50:05.136

979
00:50:05.136 --> 00:50:06.671

997

because of our great grandfather

998
00:50:53.017 --> 00:50:55.553

00:53:42.353 --> 00:53:43.187
What?

1070
00:53:44.755 --> 00:53:49.093
- Leroy works the most.
he's on that stuff.

1071
00:53:49.093 --> 00:53:51.729
So he always need money.

1072
00:53:51.729 --> 00:53:53.398
I'll call Leroy now.

1073
00:53:53.398 --> 00:53:54.231
Hold on.

1074
00:53:59.904 --> 00:54:03.441
Okay. Leroy said he'll
be here in three hours.

1075
00:54:03.441 --> 00:54:05.976
He's pulling somebody
out of a ditch right now.

1076
00:54:07.445 --> 00:54:08.679
- Ouch!

1077
00:54:08.679 --> 00:54:11.782
- Yup. somebody's always
worse often than you.

1078
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:13.984
- Well thank you Santeria.

1079
00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:17.187
- Thank me by taking
me to that barbecue.

1080
00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:20.458
- Oh. I couldn't swing that one.

1081
00:54:21.426 --> 00:54:23.794
- Oh. hold up.

1082
00:54:23.794 --> 00:54:25.563
- I thought we was cool.

1083
00:54:25.563 --> 00:54:29.066
You was just using me
to get a holiday tow.

1084
00:54:29.066 --> 00:54:33.304
Like I'm some kinda tow hoe?
I aint nobody's tow hoe.

1085
00:54:34.439 --> 00:54:38.175
- Santeria look.
I'm in a situation.

1086
00:54:38.175 --> 00:54:41.045
I'm trying to get back
with my baby's mother

1087
00:54:41.045 --> 00:54:43.614
and it just would
be a really bad look

1088
00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:47.452
if I bring you to the family
reunion. you understand?

1089
00:54:47.452 --> 00:54:49.186
I can't show up
with another woman.

1090
00:54:50.621 --> 00:54:54.224
- Oh. sound like
you get some drama.

1091
00:54:54.224 --> 00:54:56.193
I don't like holiday drama.

1092
00:54:56.193 --> 00:54:57.895
You got any friends?

1093
00:54:57.895 --> 00:54:59.664
Get one of your
friends to take me.

1094
00:54:59.664 --> 00:55:01.165
You got a single friend. right?

1095
00:55:02.333 --> 00:55:04.902
- I have a friend you
would probably like

1096
00:55:04.902 --> 00:55:06.771
but he's not invited
to the barbecue.

1097
00:55:08.406 --> 00:55:09.640
- Well. listen.

1098
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:13.043
Jeffrey is like this.
my family lives far away

1099
00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:15.713
from me and we'd
never have reunion.

1100
00:55:15.713 --> 00:55:17.515
And I broke up with my man

1101
00:55:17.515 --> 00:55:20.951

told you I love barbecue.

1102

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:39.637

Okay.

00:56:08.933 --> 00:56:11.936
- Well. I'm not in jail for
tax evasion thanks to you.

1116
00:56:12.837 --> 00:56:14.439
And no thanks to my accountant.

1117
00:56:14.439 --> 00:56:16.073
So I'm great. brother.

1118
00:56:16.073 --> 00:56:17.742
When are we playing

Look I got a situation.

1121
00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:22.847
- A situation?

1122
00:56:22.847 --> 00:56:25.382
Come on bruh. what kind of
situation could you have?

- You know I'm dating your ex...

1125
00:56:28.352 --> 00:56:29.520
(Dante chuckling)

1126
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.922
- Please tell me that's
not the situation?

1127
00:56:31.922 --> 00:56:33.223
That's old news. man.

1128
00:56:35.693 --> 00:56:38.996
- Well. I want to take a blind
date to her family re-union.

1129
00:56:41.599 --> 00:56:42.467
- Wait. what?

1130
00:56:46.604 --> 00:56:48.405
- What are we
feeding these kids?

1131
00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:50.140
They have grown up so fast.

and rice and potato salad
and barbecue chicken.

1134
00:56:59.717 --> 00:57:02.653
- And bread. don't

1135
00:57:02.653 --> 00:57:07.257
- Like Robert said. Erica
does not eat pork anymore.

1136
00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:08.526
- What?

1137
00:57:08.526 --> 00:57:11.395
You didn't tell me you
don't eat no ham hock.

1138
00:57:11.395 --> 00:57:15.032
no bacon. no sausage.

1139
00:57:15.032 --> 00:57:16.667
- No (speaking
foreign language).

1140
00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:19.470

1145
00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:29.046
- Yeah no. I don't

1146
00:57:29.046 --> 00:57:29.880

1148
00:57:34.752 --> 00:57:35.686
- See now I know you lying.

1149
00:57:35.686 --> 00:57:37.354
'cause when you say that.

1150
00:57:37.354 --> 00:57:39.657
you have that Carter
family twitch...

1151
00:57:39.657 --> 00:57:40.591
(ladies chuckling)

1152
00:57:40.591 --> 00:57:41.325
and your eye. yeah your lying.

1153
00:57:41.325 --> 00:57:42.292
(lady laughing)

1154
00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:43.528
- And plus your feet shifted

1155
00:57:43.528 --> 00:57:45.195
like it used to
do in high school.

1156
00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:47.865
(indistinct)

1157
00:57:47.865 --> 00:57:49.800
- Go on and tell them. baby girl

1158
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.970
you want the lifestyle.
you gotta own it.

1159
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:54.539
- It's just not
healthy enough for me.

1160
00:57:54.539 --> 00:57:55.573
Sorry.

1161
00:57:55.573 --> 00:57:56.907
(woman exclaiming)

1162
00:57:56.907 --> 00:57:58.175
- There it is.

1163
00:57:58.175 --> 00:58:00.511
- What's that supposed to mean?

1164
00:58:00.511 --> 00:58:01.779
- It's supposed to mean...

1165
00:58:02.747 --> 00:58:04.649
Y'all (indistinct) that's what.

1166
00:58:04.649 --> 00:58:06.283
(woman exclaiming)

1167
00:58:06.283 --> 00:58:08.753
- It's just not healthy.

1168
00:58:08.753 --> 00:58:11.355
Then why do you care
about what I eat anyways?

1169
00:58:11.355 --> 00:58:12.590
- Oh. this aint about you.

1170
00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:15.660
See this is about the
way you were raised.

1171
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.663
because your daddy.
is my brother

1172
00:58:18.663 --> 00:58:21.231
and my brother grew
up just like me

1173
00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:23.167
and the rest of his brothers.

1174
00:58:23.167 --> 00:58:25.736
in the projects.
sleeping in bunk beds

1175
00:58:25.736 --> 00:58:29.574
and doing whatever we had
to do to make ends meet.

1176
00:58:29.574 --> 00:58:32.276
- I know this Bee. trust me

1177
00:58:32.276 --> 00:58:34.845
I spent more time with your
brother than you have..

1178
00:58:34.845 --> 00:58:36.380
I know how you all were raised.

1179
00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:37.648
so what's the point?

1180
00:58:37.648 --> 00:58:40.951
- My point is. why did
y'all raise them kids

1181
00:58:40.951 --> 00:58:44.021
to turn their backs
on family traditions?

1182
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:45.856
- Hey. I'm just the aunt.

1183
00:58:45.856 --> 00:58:48.325
Aunts and uncles are
supposed to spoil the kids

1184
00:58:48.325 --> 00:58:50.260
and their parents well.

1185
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:53.998
they just wanted them to
have the best of everything.

1186
00:58:53.998 --> 00:58:55.866
So what were we supposed to do?

1187
00:58:55.866 --> 00:58:57.935
Raise them in the projects Bee?

1188
00:58:59.403 --> 00:59:01.405
- Well how come
y'all don't visit us?

1189
00:59:01.405 --> 00:59:03.273
- Oh. we're just busy.

1190
00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:04.809
- Busy? (exclaiming)

1191
00:59:04.809 --> 00:59:07.678
A stay-at-home parent
with one child.

1192
00:59:07.678 --> 00:59:09.614
that's why you got so much money

1193
00:59:09.614 --> 00:59:11.215
and so much time.

1194
00:59:11.215 --> 00:59:13.283
- Okay. you made your point.

1195
00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:16.220
We will come and visit. okay.

1196
00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.054
- Okay.

1197
00:59:17.054 --> 00:59:18.288
- Damn.

1198
00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:19.489
- Come on baby.
give me some love.

1199
00:59:21.759 --> 00:59:23.360
(all chuckling)

1200
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.561
Aw. thank you.

1201
00:59:25.996 --> 00:59:28.065
Want your bougie hair.

1202
00:59:29.333 --> 00:59:30.868
(all chuckling)

1203
00:59:30.868 --> 00:59:33.370
- Erica. you should take a
break from your pork diet.

1204
00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:38.242
(indistinct) cook. it's
going to change your life.

1205
00:59:38.242 --> 00:59:39.376
(all exclaiming)

1206
00:59:39.376 --> 00:59:41.111
- Girl. you make
nothing sound like sex.

00:59:41.111 --> 00:59:42.379
(all chuckling)

1208
00:59:42.379 --> 00:59:43.681
Girl. don't tempt me now.

1209
00:59:46.784 --> 00:59:48.485
- Well. you know what.

1210
00:59:48.485 --> 00:59:49.319
the last time I saw you.

1211
00:59:49.319 --> 00:59:51.321
you were still a virgin.

1212
00:59:53.457 --> 00:59:54.458
Quit playing. quit playing.

1213
00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:58.228
you still a virgin?

1214
00:59:58.228 --> 00:59:59.429
- Leave him alone cuz. come on.

1215
00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:00.965
the man has been
through some things.

1216
01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:02.867
just change the subject.

1217
01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:04.434
- No. I'm not a virgin.

1218
01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.771
Can we just focus on
getting the meat ready.

1219
01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:09.506
- Sounds like you might not
have any expertise in meat.

1220
01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:11.541
(all laughing)

1221
01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:14.879
(indistinct chattering)

1222
01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:19.349
- Look Dave. if he asks
me about my sex life.

1223
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:20.751
I'm straight up
with you. all right.

1224
01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:22.519
I get it two times a year.

1225
01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:23.821
Once on Valentine's day

1226
01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:25.823
and once when the kids go away.

1227
01:00:25.823 --> 01:00:27.324
(all chuckling)

1228
01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:29.860
- Yo. Camp is the best man.

1229
01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.763
Let me tell y'all. I

1230
01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:34.264
but how many weeks go?

1231
01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:35.565
Two weeks or one week?

1232
01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:38.736
- Two weeks of
bed-breaking. house-shaking.

1233
01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:40.738
naked. ridiculously.

1234
01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:41.706
- Damn right

1235
01:00:41.706 --> 01:00:43.640
that's what I'm taking about.

1236
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.775
Now you talking.

1237
01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.010
(bottles clanking)

1238
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.212
- Oh. man Omar check it out.

1239
01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:49.013
- Your turn.

1240
01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:51.882
- My turn...

1241
01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:53.583
- Did you seriously think
we was gonna forget?

1242
01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.319
- You know I'm kind
of curious too.

1243
01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.988
So what's going on Omar?

1244
01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.824
(cross talking)

1245
01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:01.591
- Okay. okay. damn
I'll tell you.

1246
01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:02.526
- Well. tell it.

1247
01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:05.696
- The first time was in college.

1248
01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:06.931
- Okay.

1249
01:01:06.931 --> 01:01:08.733
- I had this beautiful
girl. she's in my room.

1250
01:01:09.734 --> 01:01:10.801
- Sounds good.

1251
01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:11.736
- But it was winter

1252
01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:17.374
and I get really excited. so I
forgot I left my window open.

1253
01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:21.311
So I take my pants down

1254
01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:24.548
and some air flew in my butt.

1255
01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:25.750
when things shriveled up

1256
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:27.752
and she told me she
came for some real beef.

1257
01:01:27.752 --> 01:01:29.253
not kibbles and bits.

1258
01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:31.856
(all laughing)

1259
01:01:36.961 --> 01:01:38.996
That's the only
reason I haven't-

1260
01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:41.198
I just have sex in the
summer. just in case.

1261
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.936
- This is your season. Omar.

1262
01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:47.204
(all laughing)

1263
01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.306
- Listen. not everybody
at this family reunion

1264
01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:50.607
is family. all right.

1265
01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:53.343
Now. if you make a love
connection. it's on you

1266
01:01:53.343 --> 01:01:55.045
but just be careful. all right.

1267
01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:55.880
- Real careful.

1268
01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.981
- And stay warm.

1269
01:01:56.981 --> 01:01:58.515
- And turn off the AC.

1270
01:01:58.515 --> 01:01:59.549
- And no cold drinks.

1271
01:02:00.751 --> 01:02:03.320
(all laughing)

1272
01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:07.792
(Jeffrey snoring)

1273
01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:15.265
(door thumping)

1274
01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:16.100
- You Jeffrey?

1275
01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:18.335
- [Jeffrey] Yeah.

1276
01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:19.169
- Okay. good.

1277
01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:21.038
'Cause you all set.

1278
01:02:21.038 --> 01:02:23.774
(car door opens)

1279
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:29.146
- Whoa. how'd you do
that with me in the car?

1280
01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:30.881
- Well. I used to take them.

1281
01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:32.482
but now I'm just replacing them.

1282
01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.685
- Well. good for you.

1283
01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:36.887
(both chuckling)

1284
01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:37.721
- No. good for you.

1285
01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:39.556
'cause back in the day.

1286
01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:42.426
you would have woke
up just on bricks.

1287
01:02:43.928 --> 01:02:46.396
- Well. thank you Leroy.

1288
01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:47.697
- What?

1289
01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:48.966
- I said thank you...

1290
01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:50.334
- I heard what you said.

1291
01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:51.869
How do you know my name?

1292
01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:53.237
- Santeria told me.

1293
01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:54.104
What?

1294
01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:55.072
(both scuffling)

1295
01:02:55.072 --> 01:02:56.807
How do you know Santeria my ex?

1296
01:02:56.807 --> 01:02:58.475
- She's the dispatcher at the...

1297
01:02:58.475 --> 01:02:59.609
- I don't hear you...

1298
01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.111
(Jeffrey stuttering)

1299
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.180
- She's the dispatcher at
the tow truck (gasping)

1300
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.415
(inaudible) told me.

1301
01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:08.252
(Jeffrey panting)

1302
01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:10.654
- Right. Sorry about that.

1303
01:03:12.089 --> 01:03:14.324
what the hell isn't she's
answering my phone for.

1304
01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:16.093
That girl's crazy.

1305
01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:17.127
(Jeffrey groaning)

1306
01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.896
she got me kind of...

1307
01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:19.997
- Yeah. yeah she does.

1308
01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:21.765
Okay.

1309
01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:25.269
Leroy. how much do I owe you?

1310
01:03:27.671 --> 01:03:28.939
- How much you got?

1311
01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:32.076
- No. I'm asking how
much do I owe you

1312
01:03:32.076 --> 01:03:34.244
for the tire and the service?

1313
01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:37.781
- And I'm asking you. how
much you got in that wallet?

1314
01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:41.385
- What difference does it make?

1315
01:03:41.385 --> 01:03:42.519
Just give me the price.

1316
01:03:44.088 --> 01:03:45.322
- 1500.

1317
01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:46.156
- $ 1.500?

1318
01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:46.991
- 1500.

1319
01:03:46.991 --> 01:03:47.824
- For a tire?

1320
01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.093
- Holiday prices.

1321
01:03:49.093 --> 01:03:51.328
- It's the 4th of July.
not April fool's day.

1322
01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:54.198
- It's a good tire.

1323
01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:55.966
- It ain't that damn good.

1324
01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:57.267
- Want me to take it back?

1325
01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:04.274
- I got 500 cash.

1326
01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:06.243
- Cool.

1327
01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:08.913
(playful music)

1328
01:04:19.123 --> 01:04:22.459
(indistinct chattering)

1329
01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.429
- How you been?

1330
01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:26.396
- Good to see you.

1331
01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:30.901
- Look at him. Mr
can't get it right.

1332
01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:32.502
just in time baby for a CP time.

1333
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:35.705
- Whatever y'all. I ran
into some traffic so.

1334
01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:38.775
- You still rapping there?

1335
01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:40.777
- Nah. I'm producer now.

1336
01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:41.611
(all exclaiming)

1337
01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:42.812
- I know you.

1338
01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:43.914
I remember your song.

1339
01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:46.316
eat the booty.

1340
01:04:46.316 --> 01:04:47.817
(all chuckling)

1341
01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.253
- Yeah. that was my jam.

1342
01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:50.988
That hook was on fire boy.

1343
01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:51.821
(all chuckling)

1344
01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:53.657
- Quit playing.

1345
01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:55.092
- Wait. wait. wait.

1346
01:04:55.092 --> 01:04:58.295
So this is an actual
song we're talking about?

1347
01:04:58.295 --> 01:04:59.729
That's how you pick down dog?

1348
01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.067
- Well. It was meant
to be provocative.

1349
01:05:03.067 --> 01:05:05.102
not literal.

1350
01:05:05.102 --> 01:05:06.736
Just something to
get the crowd hyped.

1351
01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.973
- [Erica] It sure
would get me hyped.

1352
01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:12.476
(all chuckling)

1353
01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:14.211
- You got a live one there man.

1354
01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:16.780
(all chuckling)

1355
01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.714
- Yeah man.

1356
01:05:17.714 --> 01:05:18.448
How long y'all been together?

1357
01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:19.283
- We were not

1358
01:05:19.283 --> 01:05:20.450
We just met...

1359
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.419
- But she got that nose open.

1360
01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:25.055
(all laughing)

1361
01:05:25.055 --> 01:05:26.623
- You right about that brother.

1362
01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:28.425
(all chuckling)

1363
01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:31.428
- Yeah well. just
keep on waiting for
Mr eat the booty here.

1364
01:05:32.796 --> 01:05:33.930
(all chuckling)

1365
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.632
- Oh. y'all got jokes.

1366
01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:37.734
(indistinct chattering)

1367
01:05:37.734 --> 01:05:40.304
(gentle music)

1368
01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:00.890
- Yo. that baby
wasn't real Right?

1369
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:03.693
- No. It's the strain man.

1370
01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:06.063
Who that get it.

1371
01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:09.899
It must be named after
like hallucinations.

1372
01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:12.002
Like you see people
that's not their.

1373
01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:13.870
- Dog. come on man.

1374
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:16.440
Saw the same damn
thing man. come on.

1375
01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.475
We both saw one
under that table.

1376
01:06:20.044 --> 01:06:22.546
- Either he's the
most somebody's skirt
or he stole the car

1377
01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:24.048
and drove away the
way that boy is gone.

1378
01:06:24.048 --> 01:06:25.349
- No he ain't. he ain't there.

1379
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:27.117
I looked up everybody's skirt.

1380
01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:28.952
he wasn't there for sure.

1381
01:06:28.952 --> 01:06:32.389
- You did what it
wasn't emergency. bro.

1382
01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:35.825
You looked at your
mother's skirt?

1383
01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.461
- What? Came from there.

1384
01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:38.395
- Ugh!

1385
01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:39.763
- Ugh? You came from one too.

1386
01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:48.004
Yo. come here little...

1387
01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:48.838
Mookie...

1388
01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:49.773
What?

1389
01:06:49.773 --> 01:06:51.108
- That's somebody's baby.

1390
01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:52.876
- No. that's a possessed baby.

1391
01:06:54.478 --> 01:06:55.712
(bright music)

1392
01:06:55.712 --> 01:06:56.946
Grown ass men and
the baby's body.

1393
01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:59.516
with a stink ass attitude.

1394
01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:00.784
- I guess you're right.

1395
01:07:00.784 --> 01:07:01.951
- I'm always right.

1396
01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:03.887
Let's go get this bad ass baby.

1397
01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:07.057
- Woo. Mae?

1398
01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:11.261
Your boy grew up
fine. well done. sis.

1399
01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:16.032
- Hm. well thanks. but I
can't take all the credit.

1400
01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.834
(Mae exhales)

1401
01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:18.968
- Yes. I guess you can.

1402
01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:22.206
You know it takes a village.

1403
01:07:22.206 --> 01:07:25.375
When our parents first had us.

1404
01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:29.679
they didn't have the
time or the commitment

1405
01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:33.183
and we spent a lot of time
with aunt Mae and uncle Victor.

1406
01:07:33.183 --> 01:07:34.584
- Yes. you did.

1407
01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:36.620
- You guys had a
lot of experiences

1408
01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.054
that our parents just didn't.

1409
01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.956
So. we've been fortunate enough

1410
01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:42.626
to learn from our four
parents instead of two.

1411
01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:44.128
- Thank you.

1412
01:07:44.128 --> 01:07:46.563
- Yes. it takes a village.

1413
01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:49.666
- Well. you know Erica.
she was the good one.

1414
01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:53.036
- Robert. hm. he was the rebel

1415
01:07:53.036 --> 01:07:55.172
always trying to do the opposite

1416
01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:58.375
of everything that his
parents wanted him to do.

1417
01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:01.511
But to know he is
in med school now.

1418
01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:03.213
So. I guess we can't complain.

1419
01:08:04.248 --> 01:08:05.949
- Oh! A doctor and lawyer?

1420
01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:06.950
I mean. I guess not.

1421
01:08:07.951 --> 01:08:09.286
- Hm.

1422
01:08:09.286 --> 01:08:10.220
- What is Mookie doing?

1423
01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.321
- Girl. Mookie is Mookie.

1424
01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:12.656
Okay?

1425
01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:15.992
Mookie is dependable
but he is funny as hell

1426
01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.931
but I cannot get him to
concentrate on nothing

1427
01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:24.601
but fast ass women with fat ass.

1428
01:08:26.503 --> 01:08:27.537
- Ms. Jackson?

1429
01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:28.938
(Mae laughs)

1430
01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.039
- Girl!

1431
01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:31.241
- I mean what?

1432
01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:34.344
- That was an insult
or a compliment.

1433
01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:36.479
I'm a little bit confused here.

1434
01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:39.183
- Well. when he first
you brought home.

1435
01:08:39.183 --> 01:08:43.520
I was a little bit concerned.
but you cool. you all right.

1436
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:48.524
So. since you brought it
up. what do you see in him?

1437
01:08:49.559 --> 01:08:51.027
He don't have any money.

1438
01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:54.964
He don't speak any espanol
and he don't dance the salsa.

1439
01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:57.501
- I love him.

1440
01:08:58.502 --> 01:08:59.736
(ladies exclaim)

1441
01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:01.371
He makes me laugh.

1442
01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:04.040
He treat me like a Latin queen.

1443
01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.611
He wants to become better
than what he is now.

1444
01:09:07.611 --> 01:09:08.878
- Wow!

1445
01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:11.615
- All I know. that's my
man. I'm keeping my man

1446
01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:15.318
and you all better
get used to it.

1447
01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:16.452

1455
01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:36.172
- Good question though.

1456
01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:37.841

1457
01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:39.908
