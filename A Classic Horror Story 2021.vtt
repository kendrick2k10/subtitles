4
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:46.916
Elisa. you okay?

5
00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:50.666
It's the second time I threw up.

6
00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:53.458
You have to eat something. pumpkin.

7
00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:55.791
Surgery's tomorrow at two.

8
00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:58.000
Doctor says you have to be in good health.

9
00:02:58.083 --> 00:02:59.041
Wait. tomorrow?

10
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.583
Why? Do you want to wait?

11
00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:03.750
No.

12
00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:06.333
You're on a trial basis.

13
00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:08.250
You can't afford to have a baby.

14
00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:10.958
I know.

15
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:12.458
It's the best thing to do.

16
00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:17.750
Come on.
We'll redo our wardrobes soon. Okay?

17
00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:18.833
Huh?

18
00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:20.958
Elisa?

19
00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:22.458
Sounds good?

20
00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:27.958
I love you. sweetie.

21
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:29.750
Very much.

22
00:03:30.708 --> 00:03:31.791
Me too. Mom.

23
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:33.416
I'll see you tonight.

24
00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:34.791
Kisses.

25
00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:58.958
HI ELISA. IT'S TIME TO JOIN YOUR FRIENDS

26
00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:23.291
One two. three… Action.

27
00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:27.083
Hi to all of Fabrizio's friends.
and welcome to this new video.

28
00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.875
So. a little guessing game.

29
00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.500
Where are we going
if I'm singing this song?

30
00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:35.583
The sky is more and more blue

31
00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:41.000
Correct. We're going to my Calabria.
and today with us we have…

32
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.666
Say your name and where you're going.
I'll cut this part.

33
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.166
The profile is called
"Fabrizio's Friends"?

34
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.958
My little sister thought of it.

35
00:04:49.041 --> 00:04:53.041
Hi. I'm Sofia.
and I'm going to a wedding--

36
00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:58.166
Hi. My name is Mark.
and we're going to a "marriaggio."

37
00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.458
Your wedding?

38
00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:06.291
Can I ask you not to talk over each other?
Otherwise. I can't edit anything.

39
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:09.166
Riccardo. doctor.

40
00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:13.333
Can you say something else. please?
Like. where you're going.

41
00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:16.708
I'm going to see my family.
but enough of that now.

42
00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:19.541
I'm sorry. but your close-up is amazing.

43
00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:21.916
You're very photogenic.
You should be an actor.

44
00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:24.958
-Hi.
-Hi.

45
00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:28.250
Don't worry.
It's for his Instagram or something.

46
00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:30.416
-It's a travel blog.
-A travel blog.

47
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.625
What do I do?

48
00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:35.166
You can say your name
and where you're going.

49
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.041
I'm Elisa. going to see my parents
for vacation.

50
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.250
Guys. could you elaborate a bit though?

51
00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:44.666
I need people who watch to get attached.

52
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:46.583
No?

53
00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:49.250
Can you at least say bye.
wave with your hand?

54
00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:50.166
Let's go!

55
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.291
Our friends still have to get warmed up.
So. it's 4:37. and we're--

56
00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:55.750
Ten minutes late.

57
00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:57.708
Ten minutes late. as the doctor says.

58
00:05:57.791 --> 00:05:59.958
Bye. Fabrizio's friends.
and always remember.

59
00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:01.750
"We'll be friends till the end."

60
00:06:02.708 --> 00:06:03.750
Cut. Save it!

61
00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:31.916
Who was the god of time?

62
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.833
Zeus.

63
00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:41.208
Which male animal has to live
inside the female in order to mate?

64
00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:52.000
-You thirsty?
-Thirsty? Yeah.

65
00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:53.083
In the back.

66
00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:07.791
-Another name for wheat?
-Grain.

67
00:07:10.416 --> 00:07:13.833
What does the clown from It feed on?
Children.

68
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.833
Fear.

69
00:07:15.916 --> 00:07:16.875
What did you say?

70
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.333
The kids are a tool.
Pennywise feeds on their fear.

71
00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:40.291
Cheers.

72
00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:45.208
Apostle who betrayed Jesus?

73
00:08:17.875 --> 00:08:21.583
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER MISSING
THE SHADOW OF 'NDRANGHETA

74
00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:25.500
Sì!

75
00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:49.416
THE MAYOR AGAINST THE MAFIA:
WE SHALL NOT BE INTIMIDATED

76
00:08:51.458 --> 00:08:53.875
No. that's the mayor. She has balls.

77
00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.750
Got half the town off the streets.

78
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:02.375
Are you okay?

79
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.875
Why don't you answer?

80
00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:45.750
Answer. please.

81
00:09:47.375 --> 00:09:50.291
If we talk. we'd find a solution
for us and our daughter.

82
00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.708
It was a fucked-up moment.
It won't happen again.

83
00:09:56.166 --> 00:09:57.291
But be reasonable.

84
00:09:57.791 --> 00:09:59.208
We're adults. Okay?

85
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.166
-Bye.
-Hey.

86
00:10:01.916 --> 00:10:03.333
The fuck? You can't.

87
00:10:03.416 --> 00:10:06.750
Stop. What the fuck are you doing?

88
00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:11.083
-Mark.
-Listen.

89
00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:13.000
It's not my RV. It's my mom's.

90
00:10:13.083 --> 00:10:15.458
If something happens. she'll bust my head.

91
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.416
-What a dick.
-Yeah. tell him.

92
00:10:29.666 --> 00:10:33.791
"Problem solved." my ass.
Problem not solved. okay? What--

93
00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:15.875
I live in Rome.

94
00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.875
Scuola… Study…
Scuola di cinema. Cinema school.

95
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:26.416
It's complicato. in Italy.

96
00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.125
What happened?

97
00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:46.916
An asshole once took my head

98
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.375
and slammed it three times
against the wall.

99
00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:55.750
-Stronzo?
-Stronzo.

100
00:13:32.916 --> 00:13:35.083
-No!
-Let's put him on the couch.

101
00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:44.458
-We have to put a splint on it.
-I have a tent.

102
00:13:44.541 --> 00:13:46.333
-Can you use the poles?
-I think so.

103
00:13:46.416 --> 00:13:48.208
-Poles. stakes. anything.
-Yes.

104
00:13:49.375 --> 00:13:51.291
Calm down. You'll make things worse.

105
00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:53.541
It'll hurt a bit.

106
00:13:56.375 --> 00:13:57.250
Here I am.

107
00:13:58.916 --> 00:14:01.375
-Hold the poles here. Like this.
-Yes.

108
00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:07.666
We're almost done.

109
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:13.083
Done.

110
00:14:13.166 --> 00:14:14.333
Elisa. call 118.

111
00:14:21.916 --> 00:14:23.000
It doesn't work.

112
00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:26.791
The line's dead.

113
00:14:29.541 --> 00:14:31.250
Fuck. Fabrizio. call 118.

114
00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:34.000
-I did. It doesn't work.
-What? It's 118!

115
00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:35.041
You wanna try?

116
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.958
Sure. I'll try.

117
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.458
Nothing.

118
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.000
Mine doesn't work either.

119
00:14:47.416 --> 00:14:50.958
We need assistance.
Go in the street and look for help.

120
00:14:52.916 --> 00:14:54.458
There is no street.

121
00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:20.625
-Nobody saw anything?
-I fainted.

122
00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:21.583
Me too.

123
00:15:23.125 --> 00:15:25.458
-How did we get here?
-Ask Mark.

124
00:15:25.541 --> 00:15:27.583
What? He dragged the RV here?

125
00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:29.125
Maybe. Why don't you ask him?

126
00:15:32.083 --> 00:15:33.000
Guys.

127
00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:04.416
Anybody home?

128
00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:07.958
We've been in an accident.

129
00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:10.458
Hello?

130
00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:13.375
Nobody's home. Let's go.

131
00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:21.416
-Let's break in.
-The owner?

132
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.500
What. break in? Let's go back to the RV.

133
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.583
Now it's my fault.

134
00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:05.375
He was falling asleep.
If I didn't swerve. we would've hit it.

135
00:17:17.583 --> 00:17:18.958
He's a moron.

136
00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.166
-Where you going?
-To look for the road.

137
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.958
-I'll come with you.
-No need.

138
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.166
Not that way.

139
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.458
-It's all the same.
-No. look at the sun.

140
00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:13.375
We have to go south.

141
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:15.000
That's south.

142
00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.333
Were you a Boy Scout?

143
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.041
No. but I grew up in places like this.

144
00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:29.666
Go back with the others.

145
00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:41.458
MOM
I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE

146
00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:45.125
I'M SCARED
WE NEED HELP

147
00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:48.958
Everything okay?

148
00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:55.416
Look how silly he is.

149
00:19:19.916 --> 00:19:21.500
Have you been together long?

150
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Since I moved to the States.

151
00:19:25.083 --> 00:19:26.541
He's not American either.

152
00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.416
He'd just gotten there from Bristol.

153
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.625
Where are you from?

154
00:19:31.208 --> 00:19:32.250
Odessa.

155
00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:35.375
But I lived a little bit everywhere.

156
00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:36.416
In Italy as well.

157
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.166
I'm like a hummingbird. You know?
Hummingbird?

158
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:44.541
What do you do?

159
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.125
An internship in a consulting firm.
I graduated from Bocconi.

160
00:19:51.583 --> 00:19:52.875
You say it like that?

161
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.916
Mostly. I'm just on the computer.

162
00:19:58.125 --> 00:20:00.500
I have a company that creates 3D jewelry.

163
00:20:01.458 --> 00:20:02.708
Your own company?

164
00:20:03.375 --> 00:20:04.458
You're so young.

165
00:20:04.541 --> 00:20:06.541
Well. it's just a startup.

166
00:20:06.625 --> 00:20:07.583
Look.

167
00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:10.708
Nice.

168
00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:21.666
You think it's his fault?

169
00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:27.625
No.

170
00:20:28.666 --> 00:20:30.000
He'll be fine. You'll see.

171
00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:42.041
You have a daughter?

172
00:20:44.833 --> 00:20:46.666
Sorry. I overheard the call.

173
00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:49.708
What's her name?

174
00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:51.416
Alma.

175
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.750
A very noble name. Alma.

176
00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:56.750
Nice. What's it mean?

177
00:20:57.458 --> 00:21:01.041
Means. mind your fucking business.
We should've found the road already.

178
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.541
Once. I saw this American movie

179
00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:13.250
about these people that end up in Limbo.
but they don't realize it.

180
00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:16.625
So they're. like. trapped. you know?

181
00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:19.041
Doomed to repeat the same actions forever.

182
00:21:20.125 --> 00:21:21.208
I don't know.

183
00:21:21.291 --> 00:21:23.708
They wake up. It's always the same day.

184
00:21:23.791 --> 00:21:27.083
Or they go downstairs
and find themselves on the same floor.

185
00:22:02.708 --> 00:22:04.041
What the fuck?

186
00:22:35.291 --> 00:22:36.416
Anybody home?

187
00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:00.291
What is this?

188
00:23:01.541 --> 00:23:02.875
Something satanic?

189
00:23:06.958 --> 00:23:10.500
THE THREE KNIGHTS OF HONOR

190
00:23:10.583 --> 00:23:11.416
More or less.

191
00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:13.541
What do you mean?

192
00:23:15.708 --> 00:23:17.333
That we have to go now.

193
00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:22.000
Look at the heads. The blood's fresh.

194
00:24:52.458 --> 00:24:54.000
The first one has no sight.

195
00:24:54.625 --> 00:24:56.250
But he'll find you in the night.

196
00:24:58.041 --> 00:25:01.750
The second one cannot hear.
but he surely smells your fear.

197
00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:06.375
Third one has no mouth to speak.
but if you see him. don't make a peep.

198
00:25:07.916 --> 00:25:12.125
A winged horse beside them all.
of death he is the call.

199
00:25:15.041 --> 00:25:18.208
It's the legend of Osso.
Mastrosso. and Carcagnosso.

200
00:25:19.291 --> 00:25:21.916
My grandma used to tell it to me
when I was little.

201
00:25:26.666 --> 00:25:29.208
These three brothers
who came from a different world.

202
00:25:30.208 --> 00:25:31.875
A long. long time ago.

203
00:25:37.333 --> 00:25:39.208
People were starving to death.

204
00:25:40.125 --> 00:25:44.500
and they promised to save them.
but only in return for a sacrifice.

205
00:25:47.583 --> 00:25:48.916
So they chose the victim

206
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.750
and prepared for the ritual.

207
00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:58.416
They cut out the tongue…

208
00:26:00.333 --> 00:26:01.375
ears…

209
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.750
and eyes.

210
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.708
With the blood. they quenched the hunger.

211
00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.416
But you don't get something for nothing.

212
00:26:15.708 --> 00:26:18.250
So. since then. the famished

213
00:26:19.208 --> 00:26:20.333
became…

214
00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:25.208
like a herd.

215
00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:32.291
Their herd.

216
00:26:36.375 --> 00:26:38.166
Your grandma told you weird stuff.

217
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.541
Enough with the bullshit now.

218
00:26:40.625 --> 00:26:42.208
The heads in the woods.

219
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:44.458
-Are you sure there were five?
-Five.

220
00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:47.166
Someone's trying to scare us.

221
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.958
Let's spend the night in the RV.
We'll leave tomorrow.

222
00:26:54.041 --> 00:26:55.291
What about Mark?

223
00:26:55.375 --> 00:26:59.583
Right now. we can't move him.
We'll find help and come back for him.

224
00:26:59.666 --> 00:27:00.541
Of course.

225
00:27:33.666 --> 00:27:35.458
Nothing. Nada.

226
00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:49.250
Fifì.

227
00:27:59.958 --> 00:28:01.500
What are you laughing at?

228
00:28:01.583 --> 00:28:02.625
Nothing.

229
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:04.666
Nothing at all.

230
00:28:06.416 --> 00:28:09.208
We hit a tree a few meters from the road.

231
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.666
Then we wake up
in front of Sam Raimi's house.

232
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.875
There are severed heads

233
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.916
and pictures of crazy farmers.

234
00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:22.333
We're isolated.

235
00:28:23.333 --> 00:28:24.958
Our cell phones don't work.

236
00:28:28.416 --> 00:28:30.000
Why is no one saying it?

237
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.083
It's the classic horror movie.

238
00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.250
-Where you going?
-Have to drain the lizard.

239
00:29:30.625 --> 00:29:33.875
MOM

240
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.666
And this? Show Mom how beautiful it is.

241
00:29:48.583 --> 00:29:49.416
Kiss?

242
00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:57.416
You're so cute! Give me a little kiss.
Mom. look how she gives Daddy a kiss.

243
00:30:12.333 --> 00:30:13.166
What is it?

244
00:30:17.833 --> 00:30:20.583
-Wait. where are you going?
-You stay with Mark.

245
00:30:57.333 --> 00:30:58.416
Stay here.

246
00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.458
Be careful.

247
00:31:11.625 --> 00:31:14.708
Come out. There's someone in the forest.
We have to get outta here.

248
00:31:14.791 --> 00:31:15.625
What the f…

249
00:31:18.875 --> 00:31:21.416
-What happened? Hey.
-Come.

250
00:31:28.083 --> 00:31:30.750
-Fabri. what's happening?
-Move. go upstairs.

251
00:31:31.333 --> 00:31:33.666
-Can you tell me what the fuck's going on?
-Go!

252
00:31:45.833 --> 00:31:46.916
What is it?

253
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.291
They cut out her tongue.

254
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.000
What did they do to you?

255
00:32:10.541 --> 00:32:12.625
I think it's best if you stay away.

256
00:32:14.958 --> 00:32:15.791
He's right.

257
00:32:16.375 --> 00:32:18.000
-Let's go.
-Will you help me?

258
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.125
-No. We have to go.
-There's a little girl.

259
00:32:21.625 --> 00:32:23.625
-It's a terrible idea.
-Let her be.

260
00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:27.208
Sofia. shit. leave her be! Let's go!

261
00:32:28.875 --> 00:32:30.666
Don't worry. I'll help you.

262
00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:50.291
Turn off the flashlight.

263
00:33:05.791 --> 00:33:08.666
-Shut up!
-Fuck you! Mark!

264
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:12.500
-Shut up! Close the trapdoor.
-Please. they have a rifle.

265
00:33:29.416 --> 00:33:32.833
Quiet. Shut up.

266
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:03.250
What do you want?

267
00:36:55.416 --> 00:36:57.416
We have to go. Let's move.

268
00:36:58.083 --> 00:37:00.500
-Wait.
-Wait for what?

269
00:37:02.666 --> 00:37:04.541
We can't leave her here.

270
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:09.625
Move.

271
00:37:15.625 --> 00:37:16.458
Come.

272
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:37.958
She's your responsibility. Let's go.

273
00:40:47.541 --> 00:40:48.625
We're not the first.

274
00:40:54.916 --> 00:40:57.458
-What are you doing?
-Maybe I can find something to eat.

275
00:40:58.333 --> 00:40:59.208
Or maybe this.

276
00:41:01.916 --> 00:41:02.750
How about you all?

277
00:41:03.541 --> 00:41:05.166
Why are you just standing there?

278
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:09.000
Bunch of incompetents.

279
00:41:09.708 --> 00:41:11.541
Two little girls. A dumbass.

280
00:41:11.625 --> 00:41:12.750
You're a lost cause.

281
00:41:13.708 --> 00:41:14.708
What did you say?

282
00:41:15.875 --> 00:41:17.041
What did you say?

283
00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:19.125
I'm a lost cause?

284
00:41:19.208 --> 00:41:21.333
Well. if you say so. it must be true.

285
00:41:21.416 --> 00:41:23.458
-You're the expert.
-Go ahead. say it.

286
00:41:24.333 --> 00:41:25.250
Let it out.

287
00:41:25.833 --> 00:41:28.125
Yes. I will. I have no problem saying it.

288
00:41:28.208 --> 00:41:30.666
-We're here because of Mark.
-How can you say that?

289
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:32.750
-Have some respect. doctor.
-Respect?

290
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.833
Respect for what? Because he died?

291
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.333
That's what we'll be doing tonight!

292
00:41:38.416 --> 00:41:41.208
You left him to die. You abandoned him.

293
00:41:41.291 --> 00:41:42.791
You didn't let me help him.

294
00:41:42.875 --> 00:41:46.083
Who do you think we are?
The Ninja Turtles?

295
00:41:46.166 --> 00:41:47.333
They were just farmers.

296
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.666
Sick people.

297
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.000
I'm not getting killed for someone
who was driving drunk

298
00:41:52.083 --> 00:41:53.458
and got us in this mess.

299
00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:54.375
Will you stop?

300
00:41:54.875 --> 00:41:56.541
It was an accident.

301
00:41:59.125 --> 00:42:00.458
I'm a doctor.

302
00:42:02.333 --> 00:42:03.791
I cure people.

303
00:42:03.875 --> 00:42:05.041
I don't save them.

304
00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:07.666
Oh yeah?

305
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.958
Can I ask you something. Riccardo?

306
00:42:12.708 --> 00:42:14.416
What kind of doctor carpools?

307
00:42:15.791 --> 00:42:19.583
As far as I know. doctors travel
on planes. trains. rental cars.

308
00:42:22.291 --> 00:42:23.791
What kind of doctor are you?

309
00:42:25.125 --> 00:42:27.750
What the fuck
has this to do with anything?

310
00:42:27.833 --> 00:42:29.666
-Enough fighting. Come on.
-Shut up!

311
00:42:32.083 --> 00:42:34.291
It's not like you did much to save him.

312
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:37.708
Why didn't you bite my hand?

313
00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:43.458
Why didn't you kick me in the balls?

314
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.958
You didn't try hard enough
to save the love of your life.

315
00:42:54.708 --> 00:42:56.250
You could've tried harder.

316
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.500
Can I see it?

317
00:43:36.583 --> 00:43:37.416
Is it yours?

318
00:43:44.833 --> 00:43:45.916
It's a beautiful name.

319
00:44:14.833 --> 00:44:16.666
You know the way out of this forest?

320
00:44:35.875 --> 00:44:38.875
IT'S NOT A FOREST

321
00:44:39.583 --> 00:44:41.375
What do you mean it's not a forest?

322
00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:04.125
We have to go.

323
00:45:53.541 --> 00:45:55.000
Are you kidding me?

324
00:46:11.958 --> 00:46:13.166
Where the fuck's the RV?

325
00:46:14.583 --> 00:46:16.375
They took the RV!

326
00:46:16.958 --> 00:46:20.541
I was sure we were going the right way.
south.

327
00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:24.875
-I don't understand why we're here.
-Yeah? You were sure?

328
00:46:24.958 --> 00:46:26.166
-You were sure?
-Wait.

329
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.666
How's it possible
that we went in a circle?

330
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:30.166
-I don't know--
-You don't?

331
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.000
-We were going south!
-You don't know?

332
00:46:32.083 --> 00:46:34.833
I wanna save myself as much as you.
I don't understand…

333
00:46:34.916 --> 00:46:36.708
We were going south.

334
00:46:39.291 --> 00:46:45.666
Fuck.

335
00:46:49.125 --> 00:46:50.000
It's okay.

336
00:46:50.916 --> 00:46:52.666
Maybe I'm… in a coma.

337
00:46:55.166 --> 00:46:56.583
Maybe it's just a nightmare.

338
00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.375
And you all don't even exist.

339
00:47:02.208 --> 00:47:05.416
Believe me.
I wish I didn't exist either. right now.

340
00:47:18.583 --> 00:47:20.666
At least they forgot this.

341
00:47:28.625 --> 00:47:30.416
Yesterday. they came after dark.

342
00:47:35.208 --> 00:47:38.083
I don't feel like going back in.
but outside's worse.

343
00:47:39.916 --> 00:47:40.791
He's right.

344
00:47:42.333 --> 00:47:43.500
What if they come back?

345
00:47:45.625 --> 00:47:49.375
If they come back. we'll burn everything.
The forest and this fucking house.

346
00:48:38.708 --> 00:48:40.458
No. thanks. I'm on guard duty.

347
00:48:54.291 --> 00:48:55.583
Disciplinary action.

348
00:48:57.916 --> 00:48:58.750
I made

349
00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:00.666
a mistake…

350
00:49:03.416 --> 00:49:04.500
and the patient died.

351
00:49:07.041 --> 00:49:08.375
My work was my life.

352
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.250
I lost everything.

353
00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:15.750
Then. one thing led to another.

354
00:49:15.833 --> 00:49:20.375
I'm at home with my wife.
One wrong word at the wrong time. and I…

355
00:49:22.666 --> 00:49:24.666
She doesn't even let me see my daughter.

356
00:49:26.458 --> 00:49:27.291
Rightly so.

357
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:33.083
I was going back home to live with my mom.

358
00:49:33.166 --> 00:49:35.541
She still thinks I'm 15.
She said. "Come back home."

359
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:38.083
Come back home.

360
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.833
That's the kind of doctor I am.

361
00:50:03.416 --> 00:50:05.541
One day. I was camping.

362
00:50:05.625 --> 00:50:08.166
and there was this guy
from the North who said.

363
00:50:09.125 --> 00:50:11.458
"You're from the South.
You must be a mafioso."

364
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:14.541
And I said.

365
00:50:15.041 --> 00:50:17.375
"Not everyone from the South
is a mafioso."

366
00:50:18.958 --> 00:50:20.000
But he insisted.

367
00:50:21.083 --> 00:50:22.375
He said. "No."

368
00:50:22.916 --> 00:50:25.125
"You're from the South. You're a mafioso."

369
00:50:27.916 --> 00:50:29.750
I tried to reason with him.

370
00:50:29.833 --> 00:50:32.916
saying that there are southerners
who don't eat pizza.

371
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.458
and there are southerners
who aren't in the Mafia.

372
00:50:37.416 --> 00:50:41.041
The next day. he says again.
"No. you're from the South."

373
00:50:41.125 --> 00:50:42.125
"You're a mafioso."

374
00:50:43.958 --> 00:50:45.666
So I had to have him killed.

375
00:51:16.666 --> 00:51:19.541
One day. I told my parents
I wanted to quit college.

376
00:51:20.583 --> 00:51:21.958
I wanted to do something else.

377
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.333
My mom put me in the car
and took me to the sea.

378
00:51:28.041 --> 00:51:30.166
A beautiful villa with a pool.

379
00:51:31.958 --> 00:51:32.958
She said.

380
00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:35.208
"Look at it."

381
00:51:36.791 --> 00:51:39.250
She insisted. "Take a better look."

382
00:51:42.375 --> 00:51:45.458
"This house would've been ours
if we hadn't paid for your studies."

383
00:51:46.583 --> 00:51:48.875
Two days later. I was back in class.

384
00:51:54.416 --> 00:51:55.750
I do it for Mark.

385
00:52:01.333 --> 00:52:02.708
You do it for the baby.

386
00:52:05.208 --> 00:52:06.041
You knew?

387
00:52:06.958 --> 00:52:08.708
Honey. everyone figured it out.

388
00:52:10.833 --> 00:52:13.625
His days were already numbered
before ending up here.

389
00:52:14.541 --> 00:52:15.375
Oh yeah?

390
00:52:16.875 --> 00:52:18.125
It's the best thing.

391
00:52:23.625 --> 00:52:24.583
Don't you think?

392
00:52:27.125 --> 00:52:28.291
How would I know?

393
00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:42.958
Take it.

394
00:52:45.375 --> 00:52:46.833
It's not true that it's nice.

395
00:52:47.958 --> 00:52:49.250
But it was my first one.

396
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:53.375
When I finished it.
I knew I could make it on my own.

397
00:53:00.625 --> 00:53:02.833
Hey. Don't cry.

398
00:56:42.583 --> 00:56:43.750
Don't look.

399
00:56:44.333 --> 00:56:45.625
Please don't look.

400
00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:15.333
We didn't even notice.

401
00:59:16.083 --> 00:59:17.458
It doesn't make sense.

402
00:59:20.625 --> 00:59:21.791
I'm sorry.

403
00:59:29.125 --> 00:59:30.416
Can I hug you?

404
01:00:03.916 --> 01:00:05.333
We didn't wake up.

405
01:00:06.333 --> 01:00:07.750
What was in this?

406
01:00:11.333 --> 01:00:12.333
What are you saying?

407
01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:14.458
You never drank.

408
01:00:15.666 --> 01:00:17.083
Why didn't you drink?

409
01:00:17.833 --> 01:00:18.916
Are you crazy?

410
01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:24.875
Please. I can't take it anymore.

411
01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:28.875
We're the only ones left.

412
01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:34.250
I'm scared. Elisa.

413
01:00:38.791 --> 01:00:39.958
I'm scared.

414
01:00:54.916 --> 01:00:56.291
Fabrizio. you hear me?

415
01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:01.791
Take her below the deer.

416
01:01:12.791 --> 01:01:15.583
If you can hear us.
take the girl below the deer.

417
01:01:16.166 --> 01:01:17.000
Who are you?

418
01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:21.125
I'm Fabrizio. It's me.

419
01:01:25.625 --> 01:01:26.541
Who's talking?

420
01:01:26.625 --> 01:01:28.166
-Nobody.
-Stay away!

421
01:01:31.958 --> 01:01:33.666
Fabrizio. can you hear me?

422
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.166
It's Fabrizio. It's me.

423
01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:39.583
The pathetic one. The dumbass…
What else you guys call me?

424
01:01:40.291 --> 01:01:41.291
Here. give it to me.

425
01:01:43.416 --> 01:01:44.250
Give it to me.

426
01:01:47.208 --> 01:01:49.541
I told you to give it to me.
for fuck's sake!

427
01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.333
No.

428
01:02:01.291 --> 01:02:02.125
No.

429
01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:05.291
No!

430
01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:08.125
No!

431
01:02:11.208 --> 01:02:14.041
No!

432
01:02:15.083 --> 01:02:20.916
No!

433
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.458
You're a bitch. a fucking whore!

434
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:27.666
A fucking slut! You've ruined everything!

435
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:30.083
Everything! You've ruined it!

436
01:02:30.916 --> 01:02:32.458
You're a fucking bitch!

437
01:02:57.791 --> 01:02:58.625
Take her.

438
01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:18.625
Help! Someone help me!

439
01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:22.000
Help me!

440
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.250
Dad. tell me something.

441
01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:02.291
When Grandpa was heartbroken.
he kept saying.

442
01:04:02.375 --> 01:04:05.125
"There's no respect anymore!"
Dad. what's respect?

443
01:04:09.416 --> 01:04:12.958
My son. respect is the virtue

444
01:04:13.041 --> 01:04:16.500
That every Calabrian man has in his heart

445
01:04:16.583 --> 01:04:19.500
This feeling doesn't exist anymore

446
01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:23.666
Respect is over. and so is honor

447
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:27.291
When your granddad talked about his past

448
01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:30.375
And his youth to his children

449
01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:34.000
He ended up with a broken heart

450
01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:38.375
Remembering everything
That isn't here anymore

451
01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:49.416
Help.

452
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.708
Please.

453
01:04:56.416 --> 01:04:57.291
Dad.

454
01:04:57.375 --> 01:05:00.791
Who were the three knights
that Grandpa always talked about?

455
01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:13.500
The three wise knights he mentioned

456
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.916
Were three saints of the holy circles

457
01:05:17.416 --> 01:05:20.333
They brought us the honorable laws

458
01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:25.208
And we are all devoted to them

459
01:05:44.583 --> 01:05:46.500
To the Three Knights of Honor.

460
01:05:47.125 --> 01:05:48.583
Our patron saints.

461
01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:53.291
Osso. Mastrosso. and Carcagnosso. Cheers.

462
01:05:59.541 --> 01:06:00.958
Now. enjoy your meal.

463
01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:30.875
Enough!

464
01:06:57.625 --> 01:06:58.458
See?

465
01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:00.708
They're all happy.

466
01:07:02.708 --> 01:07:04.083
Because I look after them.

467
01:07:05.375 --> 01:07:07.125
I am everybody's mom.

468
01:07:09.166 --> 01:07:11.000
I am everybody's mom. right?

469
01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:14.500
They're not mean.

470
01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:16.791
They're mocking you.

471
01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:20.875
But they know
you're the most precious one here.

472
01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:27.291
If you don't die.

473
01:07:27.875 --> 01:07:29.833
how can I look after them?

474
01:07:36.291 --> 01:07:37.541
You're so beautiful.

475
01:07:38.416 --> 01:07:39.958
Such a beautiful girl.

476
01:07:41.125 --> 01:07:42.041
I'm sorry.

477
01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:47.333
But the Mafia isn't what it used to be.

478
01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:52.000
We all have to adapt.

479
01:07:56.333 --> 01:08:02.958
THREE KNIGHTS CAMPING

480
01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:12.500
Help.

481
01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:17.375
Eat before it gets cold.

482
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:23.208
Help.

483
01:08:24.916 --> 01:08:27.250
Help me!

484
01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:34.041
Help! Help me!

485
01:08:45.958 --> 01:08:48.000
Help!

486
01:10:30.375 --> 01:10:31.916
Give us a nice smile. Mommy.

487
01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:39.791
You recorded everything.

488
01:10:40.333 --> 01:10:41.541
There.

489
01:10:42.166 --> 01:10:43.375
I have to be honest.

490
01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:45.416
Sometimes you guys fuck things up.

491
01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.500
but this moment when you figure it out…

492
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.791
It's the fucking best.

493
01:10:52.625 --> 01:10:53.708
Where is Chiara?

494
01:10:54.916 --> 01:10:56.208
What'd you do to her?

495
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.500
No spoilers. honey.

496
01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:01.625
Is this what you do?

497
01:11:03.791 --> 01:11:05.958
Videos of people dying?

498
01:11:07.833 --> 01:11:09.166
They're horror movies.

499
01:11:20.416 --> 01:11:21.541
The fuck are you laughing at?

500
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:31.625
So I die in some loser's fake movie.

501
01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:36.041
Where the bad guys are called Osso.

502
01:11:37.458 --> 01:11:38.583
Mastrosso. and

503
01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:42.458
Ca… Caradosso!

504
01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:44.500
Carcagnosso. It's not that hard.

505
01:11:44.583 --> 01:11:46.583
They're the three founders of the Mafia.

506
01:11:46.666 --> 01:11:50.500
and I turned them into the new Freddy.
Jason. and Leatherface. I'm a genius.

507
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.250
In the States. they would've already
signed me up for a sequel.

508
01:11:56.041 --> 01:11:57.416
Your movie sucks.

509
01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:02.333
It's a rip-off of so many others.

510
01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:07.125
People like you always criticize.

511
01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:11.291
Then in Italy. all you get is crappy
comedies and shitty YouTuber movies.

512
01:12:11.791 --> 01:12:13.458
In Italy. no one wants to be scared.

513
01:12:13.541 --> 01:12:15.958
You go to the movies and are all. "Gross!"

514
01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:19.416
"Help. help. Boohoo…"

515
01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:24.375
But then. you turn on the TV.
and there's nothing but death.

516
01:12:24.458 --> 01:12:26.416
All day long.

517
01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.666
Because you like it.

518
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.916
The student who massacres her roommate.
that's what you like.

519
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.583
The mom who choked her son… Wonderful.

520
01:12:35.666 --> 01:12:39.083
The husband who stabs his wife.
That sells more than cocaine.

521
01:12:41.625 --> 01:12:45.375
And you're asking me
what we're doing here.

522
01:12:47.166 --> 01:12:48.708
This is what you want.

523
01:12:50.208 --> 01:12:53.000
This is the most sought-after
original content.

524
01:12:54.041 --> 01:12:54.916
It's the future.

525
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:59.083
Not mine.

526
01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:01.291
We'll see.

527
01:17:12.125 --> 01:17:13.125
Bitch!

528
01:17:13.708 --> 01:17:15.833
Fucking bitch!

529
01:17:15.916 --> 01:17:19.125
I swear. I would kill her twice.

530
01:17:19.208 --> 01:17:21.750
Twice I'd like to kill that fucking tease!

531
01:17:21.833 --> 01:17:24.666
-But she fooled you.
-That scrawny bitch!

532
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:31.166
Wait. I have an idea.

533
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:32.541
-You do?
-Yes.

534
01:17:32.625 --> 01:17:36.250
Yes. So. basically. we have
the beautiful shot of the masked men.

535
01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:39.625
We stay longer
on those two assholes' sacrifice.

536
01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:41.125
Okay? Cut.

537
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.041
And there she is. lying in the house.

538
01:17:45.125 --> 01:17:49.583
I hold her tight in my arms.
and I say my beautiful line.

539
01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:51.625
"Elisa. Elisa. I'm scared."

540
01:17:52.125 --> 01:17:54.875
"I'm scared. Elisa. I'm scared."

541
01:17:55.875 --> 01:17:56.916
It doesn't work.

542
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.416
How will you knock her out?
If you hit her again. she'll die.

543
01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:04.916
-With the beer.
-Doesn't work.

544
01:18:05.416 --> 01:18:08.625
Come on. I mean. all you can say is.
"It doesn't work."

545
01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:11.875
Mom was clear.
The client wants her conscious.

546
01:18:11.958 --> 01:18:15.541
Fuck Mom too!

547
01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:19.875
-Lower your voice.
-Fuck that! I'm not lowering my voice!

548
01:18:19.958 --> 01:18:21.958
Look what I've been through

549
01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:25.458
to get the RV
because the English guy wanted to drive!

550
01:18:25.541 --> 01:18:28.041
You screwed it up.
You caused the accident.

551
01:18:28.125 --> 01:18:30.000
-And that Elisa!
-I don't care.

552
01:18:30.083 --> 01:18:33.583
Only thing she figured out
is there was something in the beer!

553
01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:34.583
Did I complain?

554
01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:37.666
I was scratched up.
always sweaty. and I couldn't talk.

555
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:39.916
-You're useless!
-I cut out your tongue!

556
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I'm the director.

557
01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:44.666
I'll go to Mom. and she'll kick your ass
because you can't do anything.

558
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:49.750
-I'm the artist in this family.
-Lower your voice!

559
01:18:49.833 --> 01:18:51.041
Shut up!

560
01:19:02.041 --> 01:19:03.125
You're incompetent.

561
01:19:06.125 --> 01:19:07.250
Midget.

562
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:27.416
Two days with this thing in my mouth.

563
01:19:28.041 --> 01:19:31.541
-Next time. I'll be the bad guy.
-Mom doesn't know shit about horror.

564
01:19:31.625 --> 01:19:33.291
She's the boss.

565
01:19:33.375 --> 01:19:36.375
If she wants her to be conscious
when she dies. she will be.

566
01:19:36.458 --> 01:19:40.583
Doesn't make any sense.
Like Leonardo DiCaprio frozen.

567
01:19:40.666 --> 01:19:42.666
Why the fuck doesn't he climb on the door?

568
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:48.833
That is true. There was room.

569
01:19:49.416 --> 01:19:52.041
We'll be ready in 15.
Get the girl into the house.

570
01:19:52.875 --> 01:19:54.541
There you go. Huh?

571
01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:58.625
Now what? What do I do now?
Tell me. what do I do?

572
01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:00.083
I don't know.

573
01:20:08.083 --> 01:20:10.875
Stop drinking.
or you'll have to pee on set.

574
01:20:11.458 --> 01:20:12.750
I speak from experience.

575
01:20:30.208 --> 01:20:31.083
Oh fuck.

576
01:21:12.916 --> 01:21:14.541
The girl escaped!

577
01:21:16.666 --> 01:21:18.125
The girl escaped!

578
01:21:24.916 --> 01:21:27.125
Okay. you'll kill me. and then what?

579
01:21:27.208 --> 01:21:28.833
What the fuck you gonna do?

580
01:21:28.916 --> 01:21:31.791
They're in the house waiting for you.

581
01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:39.791
They'll cut you up.
and they'll feed you to the pigs.

582
01:21:39.875 --> 01:21:42.541
You understand?
They'll feed you to the pigs.

583
01:21:44.791 --> 01:21:45.625
Come on.

584
01:21:48.541 --> 01:21:49.791
Put that rifle down.

585
01:21:51.375 --> 01:21:53.333
Let's find a solution. something.

586
01:21:53.416 --> 01:21:55.375
If you want to live. you need me.

587
01:21:55.958 --> 01:21:59.208
-You can't do it alone.
-You fucking talk too much.

588
01:22:02.416 --> 01:22:04.041
Please. don't do it.

589
01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:08.041
I'm scared.

590
01:22:10.333 --> 01:22:11.958
I'm scared.

591
01:22:15.333 --> 01:22:18.333
Don't worry. It's just a movie.

592
01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:22.125
Bitch.

593
01:22:22.833 --> 01:22:27.041
You bitch. You deserve to die on--

594
01:23:03.375 --> 01:23:04.708
There is your ending.

595
01:25:02.875 --> 01:25:07.791
MILITARY AREA - NO TRESPASSING
ARMED SURVEILLANCE

596
01:26:17.958 --> 01:26:19.625
MOM
THE SURGERY IS IN A FEW HOURS

597
01:26:19.708 --> 01:26:20.916
WHY IS YOUR MOBILE OFF?

598
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.958
IF IT'S A PRANK.
YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH IT

599
01:28:05.583 --> 01:28:08.750

US ITALIANS ARE NOT GOOD
AT MAKING HORROR MOVIES.

01:28:30.291 --> 01:28:32.458
