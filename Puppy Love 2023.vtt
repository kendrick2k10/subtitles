00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.156
-Oh. God.
-[Chaim] Hey. thinking about tonight.

12
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:13.616
Why don't we just stay in?

13
00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:17.077
Hang out and talk about life. you know?

14
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:20.581
Sounds refreshing. but I have
my sister's engagement thing tonight.

15
00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:23.334
[Chaim] Oh. hell yeah. I'm in!
I'll be there.

16
00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.753
Oh. no. No. it's... it's family stuff.

17
00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:28.547
so you could totally be out
if you wanted to.

18
00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:32.593
Okay. listen. Nicole.
uh. I actually think that we need to talk.

19
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:35.638
Okay. aren't we currently talking
right now? I don't...

20
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:38.057
You are completely shut off.

21
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.892
[gasps] I'm not.

22
00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:42.061
I am not shut off.
I don't know.

23
00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:45.606
I feel like you're incapable
of loving anyone.

24
00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.066
Chaim. can we just. like...

25
00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.944
That's not even my name. It's Chaim.

26
00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:51.402
Okay. Chaim.

27
00:01:51.487 --> 00:01:53.280
-[Chaim] Chaim!
-Chaim.

Hey. sweetie.

Is that a girl? Oh. my...

-No. I'm not... It's...
-Did she spend the night?

00:02:08.963 --> 00:02:10.965
-I'm at a drive-thru. Goodbye. goodbye.
-Is she cute?

45
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.073
There was that one time where I was
telling you about a dream that I had.

46
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.324
Oh. My lip balm.

47
00:02:37.408 --> 00:02:39.076
[Chaim] You don't even talk to me
about your dreams.

48
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.703

And it's another pleasant day.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.429
Before we begin. remind yourself
that this is a time...

55
00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:01.515
-[sighs] Okay. I can do it.
-...for you and you alone.

56
00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.727
I'm just gonna walk into the office

57
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.646
and not be weird.

58
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.485
-[guide] Relax your neck and shoulders.
-They're just people that I actually know.

59
00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:17.990
[guide]
Deepen your breath in through the nose...

60
00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:19.617
-Okay.
-...and out through the mouth.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.285
-[horn honks]
-[gasps]

62
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:23.537
I hate people. I hate people.

63
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:26.332
-[horn honking]
-Yeah. God.

64
00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:27.875
-[horn honks]
-Yeah. okay!

65
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.337
[guide]
And travel your consciousness down...

66
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.421
[inhales] Okay.

67
00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:34.298
-[ringtone blares]
-God...

68
00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:37.134
[Sid] Bro. this is getting ridiculous.

69
00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:38.844
[Max] I was planning on coming in.

70
00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:41.805
It's just. my uncle's in the hospital
with. um. a thing.

71
00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.641
-And. um...
-[Sid]You're such a liar. Max.

72
00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:45.809
Someone already saw you outside.

73
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:47.937
And I'm looking at you
from my window right now...

74
00:03:48.938 --> 00:03:50.773
circling the parking lot
looking like a freak.

75
00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:52.399
Look like a student driver. bro.

76
00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:53.984
I...

77
00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.236
Look. I know things are rough.

78
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.863
-man. but...
-You don't... [sighs]

79
00:03:57.947 --> 00:03:59.573
Are you okay?

80
00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.992
I can't explain it. okay?
I just... I... I don't know.

81
00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:03.202
I mean. my... my...

82
00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:06.163
my heart's beating really fast.
and I'm... I'm sweating.

83
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.748
and I just. um... It's just...

84
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.292
You are really taking advantage
of my post-COVID.

85
00:04:10.376 --> 00:04:12.044
very liberal work-from-home policy.

86
00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:15.464
-This is a real condition. Sid. Okay?
-I know. social anxiety is real.

87
00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.466
I feel for you. dawg.
I seen the commercials.

88
00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:20.803
You gotta snap that shit quick.
'cause I can't protect you anymore.

89
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.513
You're gonna get canned.

90
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:25.015
I can't do it. I can't do it.

91
00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.267
I'm going to talk to my fucking therapist.

92
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.730
[Max] I blew off the office. Again.

93
00:04:31.814 --> 00:04:33.232
I did go get coffee.

94
00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:36.318
but. um. it was the...
it was the drive-thru.

95
00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.446
-Sorry.
-No need to apologize. Max.

96
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.409
Yeah. No. no. I know. I just... You know.
I just feel like a helpless idiot.

97
00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:46.578
Well. I don't listen to helpless idiots.

98
00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:48.497
Uh...

99
00:04:49.373 --> 00:04:51.207
you're my therapist. so...

100
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.292
It's called mirroring.

101
00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:53.919
-It's a therapy technique.
-Oh.

102
00:04:54.003 --> 00:04:56.171
Shows you how you talk about yourself.

103
00:04:56.255 --> 00:04:58.674
Oh. wow. that's... that's cool. Um...

104
00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.217
And that... that's supposed to help?

105
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.719
Rarely.

106
00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:06.098
Perhaps now it's time to introduce
something a little different.

107
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.725
Oh. yeah? Something else?

108
00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:08.976
Pet therapy.

109
00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.644
-[sighs]
-Now listen.

110
00:05:10.728 --> 00:05:14.440
if you can talk to a dog
and make an emotional connection.

111
00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:17.693
it can help you learn
how to connect with people.

112
00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:20.195
-Um...
-Dogs teach acceptance.

113
00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.866
It's just. you know. a dog is a serious
invasion of my. um. of my space.

114
00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.869
Max. we need to take some bold steps here.

115
00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:30.039
-I'm... I'm not sure I'm capable...
-Do you have a problem with dogs. Max?

116
00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:31.373
Well. I just...

117
00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:33.834
I don't have a problem with a dog.

118
00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.086
"I don't have a problem with a dog."

119
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.337
-What?
-"What?"

120
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:39.381
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry. I just...

121
00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:42.634
That was mirroring.

122
00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:45.012
Mirroring. Mm-hmm.

123
00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.765
-Um...
-Go out. Max.

124
00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:52.770
Go out and make a canine connection.

125
00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.354
Yeah. I get it.

126
00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:56.648
Hey.

127
00:05:56.732 --> 00:05:59.735
-Whatever-his-name broke up with me.
-Oh. no. Really?

128
00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:03.530
Yeah. He said I was closed off.
but. like. I let him in.

129
00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:04.907
Like. in.

130
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.117
You know there are
other kinds of intimacy. right?

131
00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:08.535
All the way in.

132
00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:11.246
I'm just worried
Bumble's gonna raise its price on ya.

133
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.749
Listen. I just have a lot
going on right now with work

134
00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.250
and just. like. life in general.

135
00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:17.878
And I know that I have my needs.
but I don't need a guy for that.

136
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.630
Serious question.

137
00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.800
Do I put my real height in my profile
or my height in heels?

138
00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:26.553
-Uh. not needed. Tonight we're going out.
-[Nicole] Oh. thank God.

139
00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:31.433
-[muttering]
-I think this will look good here.

140
00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:35.521
These are pretty good.

141
00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:38.065
-Oh. thanks. Here.
-Mm.

142
00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:39.525
Listen.

143
00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:43.987
Hunter Fosterini is putting
his Bellevue estate on the market.

144
00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:46.198
Wait. CEO of Crypt-Yo?

145
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.826
-He's hired me to stage it.
-Really?

146
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.702
But with the twins coming.

147
00:06:50.786 --> 00:06:53.330
I'm finally promoting you to do it solo.

148
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.332
Oh. my God.
Stacey. are you serious? That...

149
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.043
-Wow. I...
-It's make-or-break.

150
00:06:58.127 --> 00:07:00.295
Yeah. No. I know that. [chuckles]

151
00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:03.966
As one strong woman to you.

152
00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:05.759
don't mess it up.

153
00:07:05.843 --> 00:07:07.302
I... I won't. I will not.

154
00:07:07.386 --> 00:07:08.929
I will... I won't let you down.

155
00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.014
Just make him feel good about himself.

156
00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:14.434
Blur the line between stager
and potential sexual partner.

157
00:07:14.518 --> 00:07:16.353
That's how you'll succeed.

158
00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:28.949
Oh. Hi.

159
00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:32.494
Wait. are you somebody's?

160
00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.998
Oh. no. no. no. No. no.

161
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.541
No. no. no. I'm sorry.

162
00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:41.044
Sorry. buddy. I've just got to go find
an outfit for my sister to criticize.

163
00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:42.337
But good luck. okay?

164
00:07:45.257 --> 00:07:46.258
[employee] Thank you so much

165
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.551
-for coming down and checking us out.
-[Max] Yeah.

166
00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.512
You know. these dogs
do deserve a loving home.

167
00:07:50.596 --> 00:07:51.597
[dogs barking]

168
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.851
And I got the perfect fucking guy for you.
Real beauty.

169
00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:59.188
Just needs some belly rubs
and tolerance training.

170
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:00.856
-[dog barking]
-Oh. my...

171
00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.649
Oh. don't worry. he'll get bigger.

172
00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:03.775
[Max] That's a therapy dog?

173
00:08:03.859 --> 00:08:04.985
Oh. yeah. He's perfect for you.

174
00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:07.154
You're not gonna have
any problems with this guy.

175
00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.947
He'll destroy anyone that messes with you.

176
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:11.241
-Um. I...
-[barking continues]

177
00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:13.577
I mean. I've seen him go ballistic.

178
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.288
Anyone look him directly in the eye.
they're fucked!

179
00:08:16.872 --> 00:08:18.790
-I don't think this is a good idea.
-[barking continues]

180
00:08:18.874 --> 00:08:20.500
-What?
-I'm sorry. I just... I don't need a...

181
00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:23.462
Oh. don't worry about it. No problem.
We've got some other dogs.

182
00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.547
Hmm. Ah.

183
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.134
What about
this cute little one right here. huh?

184
00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.222
[chuckles]

185
00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:38.018
[Max] What's her name?

186
00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.354
[employee] Well. it's up to you. my dude.

187
00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.606
Just bring her back in a week
to get spayed.

188
00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:45.734
She might be perfect for you.

189
00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:48.862
Yeah. maybe she is.

190
00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:52.699
[chuckles]

191
00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.455
[sighs]

192
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.834
Sorry. I'm just...
I'm just a little nervous. Uh...

193
00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.004
[sighs]

194
00:09:06.797 --> 00:09:10.133
Well. hey. if you wanna change anything.
that's fine. You know?

195
00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.304
Just run it by me first. if that's cool.

196
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.811
So what do I call you?

197
00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:24.606
King Charles? Or Queen Charles?

198
00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:31.780
What do you think about. uh. Chloe?

199
00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:39.997
I think I'm gonna call you Chloe.
if that's okay.

200
00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.332
Great.

201
00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.126
Do you want to do a tour?

202
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.714
Um. I work in IT.
This is my work-from-home station.

203
00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:51.466
Popped for Xfinity.
so my Internet's crazy fast.

204
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.010
like. over a gig.

205
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.054
Trust me. that's really fast.

206
00:09:56.138 --> 00:09:58.473
I mean. I... I could talk about
this shelf all day.

207
00:09:58.557 --> 00:10:01.518
We got an unopened '80s original
right here.

208
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.895
And this whole collection
is just next-level.

209
00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:04.980
Oh. and...

210
00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:09.359
So Brando smoked this
for one take in The Godfather.

211
00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:12.362
I mean. supposedly.
It didn't make the final cut of the film.

212
00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:17.743
But he did smoke a cigar in the poster.
so it's still kind of dope. [exhales]

213
00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:20.329
This is my keyboard.

214
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.915
-[keyboard playing]
-[laughs]

215
00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:25.334
That's not bad.

216
00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:27.961
And. you know.
it can be yours. if you want.

217
00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:32.007
I'm... I'm really tired of making music
just for myself. so...

218
00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:35.052
Well... [sighs] ...that's it.

219
00:10:36.053 --> 00:10:37.512
That's me.

220
00:10:37.596 --> 00:10:39.306
It's impressive. right?

221
00:10:39.765 --> 00:10:42.017
Oh. thank you.

222
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.518
That's fine. I guess.

223
00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:46.813
Wow.

224
00:10:48.357 --> 00:10:49.816
[sighs]

225
00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.366
[exhales] Okay.

226
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.871
Mom? Hello?

227
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:06.750

-Princess. you're looking hypoallergenic.
-[hisses]

231
00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:23.016
[Nicole's mother] Nicole?

232
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.101
[meows]

233
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:27.979
Hey!

234
00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:31.066
-Shoes.
-Oh.

235
00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:34.027
Shoes. Nicole.
You know we don't wear shoes in the house.

236
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:35.862
[sighs] It's good to see you too. Mom.

237
00:11:37.656 --> 00:11:40.075
Hi. Sis. I'm home.

238
00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:41.159
Hi!

239
00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:42.911
-Shoes!
-Hi!

240
00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.622
-Okay.
-I don't think we've met yet.

241
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:46.706
-Oh!
-Hi.

242
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.793
-Nicole. this is Alistair.
-[Nicole] Hello.

243
00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:53.463
He flew all the way here
to ask Mom for my hand.

244
00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:54.923
-[Alistair] Well. of course.
-Oh. wow. That...

245
00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:56.758
-I had to come for this. [kisses]
-Oh. [giggles]

246
00:11:56.842 --> 00:11:59.428
-Mom. is this your ring?
-[both giggling]

247
00:12:00.262 --> 00:12:02.806
Well. you're hardly
galloping down the aisle. Nic.

248
00:12:03.432 --> 00:12:05.100
[timer dings]

249
00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.477
So. how's work going. Nicole?

250
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:10.939
Uh. oh. really good. actually.

251
00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:15.068
Yeah. Stacey promoted me
to head stager today. I think.

252
00:12:15.152 --> 00:12:16.528
[gasps] She's killing it.

253
00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:19.614
Number two for Stacey Dorin.
a legend in home staging.

254
00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:20.782
Oh. my God.

255
00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:23.869
Nicole's a very talented artist.
She could have gone to art school.

256
00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:27.372
But instead she chose to spend
her life rearranging furniture. [chuckles]

257
00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:31.918
It's home staging. Mom.
in highest-luxury real estate.

258
00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.463
You make it sound like
it's musical chairs.

259
00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.673
She turned down a spot at U-Dub
for art and design.

260
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.259
Yeah. well. someone needed
to take care of Dad

261
00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:40.635
while you were in Paris. so...

262
00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:42.929
-See what I mean? Defensiveness.
-[Alistair] Mm-hmm.

263
00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.474
I mean. she's been completely closed off
these last three years.

264
00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:46.558
Curious.

265
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.852
Mom. I'm literally sitting right here.

266
00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:51.104
-I mean. she parties every night.
-Yeah.

267
00:12:51.188 --> 00:12:55.400
But I'm afraid.
deep down. she's really lonely.

268
00:12:55.484 --> 00:12:57.402
-Fascinating.
-Oh. my God. Mom.

269
00:12:57.486 --> 00:13:00.822
Why are you discussing this with Alistair?

270
00:13:00.906 --> 00:13:03.033
Because he's British. Nicole.

272
00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:12.501
Nothing good happens out there
past 9:00 p.m.

273
00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.922
Just a bunch of packed bars

274
00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:20.342
and people breathing on each other.

275
00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:22.969
â™ª I. I. I can't go now â™ª

276
00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:26.640
â™ª DJ's playing
my. my. my. my song now â™ª

277
00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:29.601
â™ª But if you want to wait all night â™ª

278
00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:35.190
â™ª I just might
go all the way with you tonight â™ª

279
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.026
â™ª Erase the visual
you like my... â™ª

280
00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.611
You killed it on the bridge.

281
00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:43.240
Uh. no. you killed it. Oh. my God.

282
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:50.789
Yeah. there are zero
one-night-standable guys in this bar.

Okay. hold on.

Hmm.

294
00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:30.954
Oh.

295
00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:33.623
Hi.

296
00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:34.833
Who are you?

297
00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.918
Delivery guy.

298
00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:40.922
Well. I'm willing to receive a delivery.

299
00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.051

Hello. it's me.

Listen. I just wanted to let you know
that I can let people in.

313
00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:24.507
I actually let so many people in.

Would you like argan oil to strengthen.

343

or coconut milk to thicken?

344
00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:47.173
Hmm?

345
00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:52.846
Argan oil?

346
00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:56.808
Yeah. Smart dog. Solid choice.

347
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.566
Done. Okay. let's take a peek. Okay.

348
00:17:04.648 --> 00:17:07.694
One. two. three.

349
00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.362
Oh. wow.

350
00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:12.281
Look at you. handsome!

351
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.491
Ooh.

352
00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:16.493
It's like I'm looking at Channing Tatum.

353
00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:18.621
Yeah. There's you.

354
00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:20.290
[rustling]

355
00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:23.417
Chloe. whatever you're doing is loud.
I'm trying to sleep.

356
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.128
Are you trying to dig a hole?

357
00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:30.300
Thank you.

358
00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:39.476
[groaning]

359
00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:44.481
Definitely woken up next to hairier.
that's for sure.

360
00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:47.025
Good morning.

361
00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:50.612
[groans] No. No morning-after makeouts.

362
00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:52.363
[sighs]

363
00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:55.909
Okay. All right. [sighs]

364
00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.660
Time to find your person.

365
00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:02.499
-We have 32 pounds.
-Mm.

366
00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.000
He's in great shape.

367
00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.878
You're a tough guy. aren't you?
You're a real tough guy.

368
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:09.255
Hey. tough guy. how old are you?
Can you tell me?

369
00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:11.382
"Oh. I'm two years old. yes."

370
00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:12.717
He says he's two years old.

371
00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.594
-Isn't that cute? You know what?
-Okay. Adorable.

372
00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:15.762
Here's an odd thing.

373
00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:19.599
I don't see any testicles.
so he's been neutered. but no chip.

374
00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:22.519
-So two snips. zero chips.
-Um...

375
00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.729
Did you find him outside of a store
with a sign reading.

376
00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:26.439
-"No chips. no balls. no service"?
-[groans]

377
00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:27.732
[chuckling]

378
00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:29.067
-Okay.
-We have fun here.

379
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.194
So what do I do then?
What am I supposed to do?

380
00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:34.906
Well. the first thing you should do
is get him some shots for worms.

381
00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:38.243
because he was a stray.
and that's very common.

382
00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:41.287
And it's also extremely common
for humans to ingest them.

383
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.289
So have you checked your stools yet?

384
00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:45.166
-My stool?
-For worms.

385
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.417
Holy shit. No. I haven't.

386
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:49.671
And maybe for an old Monopoly piece if
you ever shoved one of those up your butt.

387
00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.798
-Jesus Christ. Okay. All right.
-[laughing] It happens.

388
00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.716
It happens when you're a kid.

389
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.845
All right. well. good luck. pal.

390
00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:58.096
Um. okay. well. the thing is...

391
00:18:58.179 --> 00:18:59.430
He's gonna be
a great dog for you. I think.

392
00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.349
The thing is. I just...
I can't have a dog right now.

393
00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:03.101
-I'm really busy. I'm never home.
-You're busy?

394
00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:04.686
Yeah. work. is... It's crazy.

395
00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:06.521
-It's crazy. Yeah. So what do you do?
-Right now. yeah.

396
00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:10.191
Are you like a long-haul trucker.
or you work on an oil rig or neurosurgeon?

397
00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:11.401
-I'm a home stager.
-Ah.

398
00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:14.529
Yeah. for high-end luxury real estate.
It's kind of a big deal. so...

399
00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:17.907
Do you still want her to be your owner?
"Probably not. She seems selfish."

400
00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:20.577
Hey. she's not selfish. She's just busy.

401
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.662
-You don't have to talk through the dog.
-I can't help it. He's very talkative.

402
00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:23.746
Okay.

403
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.457
You know what? That's fine.
Don't worry about it.

404
00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:29.335
Don't adjust your lifestyle
for anything or anybody.

405
00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:30.420
Excuse me?

406
00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:31.921
Sorry. That was an inner thought.

407
00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:35.174
I think you should post on Nextdoor.
maybe put up a few flyers.

408
00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:37.051
and if you don't hear anything.

409
00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:39.470
you know. take him to
an animal shelter. I guess.

410
00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:42.265
-They'll find him a home. right?
-Yeah. probably not.

411
00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:44.434
You might as well get it over with...
put up the flyers.

412
00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.228
and then get ready to see this guy
in the dumpster.

413
00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:52.108
Typically I wouldn't be outside
during a pedestrian hour.

414
00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:53.735
or ever.

415
00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:55.987
but it's better you pee out here
than on my floor.

416
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.781
So. just get it done. and then we'll go...

417
00:19:58.865 --> 00:19:59.866
Oh. my God.

418
00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:02.827
-Oh. God. Fuck. No.
-[dog walker] Hi. friends.

419
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:05.246
-Chloe. no. no. no. no. no.
-[gasps] And who is this?

420
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.665
-Uh. she's...
-Oh. so adorable!

421
00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:09.042
Come here. you. Come here.

422
00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.877
-She's. uh. Chloe.
-Come here. Come here.

423
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.670
-[Max] Mm-hmm.
-So adorable.

424
00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.047
-Oh. Oh!
-Oh.

425
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.299
-Oh. my God. Yeah.
-Such a sniffer.

426
00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:17.508
-Whoa.
-All right.

427
00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:18.843
Um. could you just...

428
00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:21.804
Okay. Please. um. just... Thank you.

429
00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:24.140
Hey. we should do a playdate.

430
00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:25.433
Oh. um...

431
00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:27.518
Okay. bye.

432
00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.812
Come on. Strawberry!

433
00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.606
Chloe. never do that again. okay?

434
00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:35.276
Do you hear me?
I was just violated for you.

435
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.446
Your Canva presentation looks pretty dope.

436
00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:39.781
Well. I'm trying.

437
00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:41.950
I really have to impress this guy.

438
00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:44.661
Next. maybe you should make
lost dog posters.

439
00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.245
Do you think someone's gonna claim him?

440
00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:49.040
I mean. maybe he's already home.
Your place is a dumpster.

441
00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:51.459
My place is not a dumpster.
It's organized chaos.

442
00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:53.336
-Mm-hmm. Oh. Oh.
-[spattering]

443
00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:56.339
-Oh. your dog.
-Hey! Oh! No. no! No. boy.

444
00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:58.633
Oh. [sighs]

445
00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:02.178
Okay. All right.
Fine. I will take him out. [groans]

446
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:04.263
Looks like you got a girlfriend.

447
00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:06.891
[chuckles] Maybe a little.

448
00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:09.352
Yeah... But no. you know. not really.

449
00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:11.396
Maybe it's time for a real one?

450
00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.606
Oh. no. I mean. I don't know.

451
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.317
I... [chuckles] I got a dog. so...

452
00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:18.903
Why? Because you're an ugly loser?

453
00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:20.863
Okay. can we maybe stop
with the mirroring?

454
00:21:20.947 --> 00:21:22.699
It kind of hurts my feelings.

455
00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:25.868
Let's just try going out on a random date.

456
00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:30.415
Think of it as an experiment
in conquering your anxiety.

457
00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.166
You never need to see them again.

458
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.877
This is the next step.

459
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.464
Maybe Chloe can help you
with your dating profile.

460
00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:43.302
Back on the prowl.

461
00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:47.223
[shutter clicking]

462
00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.392
Ah! Do you approve?

463
00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:51.477
-[growls]
-I'm gonna take that as a yes.

464
00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:54.022
Add new photo.

465
00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:57.692
What do you think? Not bad. right?

466
00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:00.486
Do your magic. Bumble.

467
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.031
Okay. Now we wait.

468
00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:07.035
Nice. Neat.

469
00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:10.038
Reasonably funny.

470
00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:14.876
Currently have a job. at time of posting.

471
00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:18.046
[sighs] I should put some hobbies.

472
00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:20.965
Figurine aficionado?

473
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:23.968
How about hanging with my fluffy roommate?

474
00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:26.137
Yeah?

475
00:22:27.889 --> 00:22:29.307
[sighs] This is stupid.

476
00:22:30.308 --> 00:22:34.771
I just want you to know. if I ever manage
to actually bring home another woman.

477
00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:38.232
it's not gonna change
what we're building together.

478
00:22:38.316 --> 00:22:40.151
[laughs]

479
00:22:40.234 --> 00:22:43.112
No bio. Only an Instagram link.

480
00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:45.740
That's a really deep V-neck.

481
00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:50.119
Why are you posting a group photo?
Which one are you?

482
00:22:50.203 --> 00:22:53.331
Oh. my God.
This guy is literally in prison.

483
00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:57.585
"Reasonably funny."

484
00:22:57.668 --> 00:22:58.836
[chuckles]

485
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.757
Okay. Oh. my God. Wow.

486
00:23:03.674 --> 00:23:05.093
Your dog is a ten.

487
00:23:06.052 --> 00:23:07.470
Hey.

488
00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:09.847
I'm gonna swipe right on this one
for you. all right?

489
00:23:18.189 --> 00:23:19.273
Damn.

490
00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:22.485
This girl's out of my league. [exhales]

491
00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:28.908
But. as a very wise Jedi Master once said.

492
00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:33.746
[imitating Yoda]
"Do. Or do not. There is no try."

493
00:23:35.164 --> 00:23:36.249
Yeah.

494
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.712
[sighs] Look. Chloe. you gotta understand.
this girl's hot.

495
00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:44.674
and I'm kinda odd.

496
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.136
-No. no. no. no. no. no. no.
-[app chimes]

497
00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:52.974
[chuckling] Oh. my God. Oh. my God!

498
00:23:55.351 --> 00:23:56.978
Oh. my God.

499
00:24:00.857 --> 00:24:02.942
Does this mean I have to
actually meet up with her?

500
00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:04.610
Whoo-hoo.

501
00:24:04.694 --> 00:24:06.320
She's way out of your league. dude.

502
00:24:06.404 --> 00:24:08.990
-Yeah. man. thank you. I know that.
-Well. don't worry about it.

503
00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:11.075
I got a three-step approach
that is guaranteed

504
00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:13.744
to help you score points on any date.

505
00:24:13.828 --> 00:24:16.873
Trust. 'Cause you already know
the ladies I be bringin' in.

506
00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:17.999
No. I don't.

507
00:24:18.082 --> 00:24:20.293
Well. I mean. you heard about
my many stories of conquest.

508
00:24:20.376 --> 00:24:21.627
No. What are you talk...

509
00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:24.213
You're the only person I know from school
other than me that's still single.

510
00:24:24.297 --> 00:24:25.882
Take this down.

511
00:24:25.965 --> 00:24:27.717
-Step one.
-Give me my phone.

512
00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:30.219
You want to get
on the lady's level. right?

513
00:24:30.303 --> 00:24:31.429
Which in your case.

514
00:24:31.512 --> 00:24:33.890
you're gonna have to
bring her down to your level.

515
00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:38.477
So you have to neg her to keep
her vulnerable with. uh. veiled insults.

516
00:24:38.561 --> 00:24:41.063
-That will keep her off guard.
-Insult her.

517
00:24:41.147 --> 00:24:45.526
So you want to say something like.
"Oh. those shoes were hot last season."

518
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:46.944
I don't know what a season is.

519
00:24:47.028 --> 00:24:48.863
Doesn't matter. She does.

520
00:24:48.946 --> 00:24:51.407
-Step two. Now you broke her down...
-Yeah.

521
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.451
...you want to build her up now.

522
00:24:53.534 --> 00:24:55.036
-[whimpers]
-Be specific.

523
00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:57.997
Talk about her nail polish
and how that's a great color on her.

524
00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.333
-Okay. her nail polish.
-Yeah. she'll love that.

525
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.251
-And then comes the physical part.
-Yeah?

526
00:25:02.335 --> 00:25:03.753
-My favorite.
-Mm-hmm.

527
00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:05.463
-You ready for this? Okay.
-Yeah.

528
00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:08.674
Blow on her neck.

529
00:25:08.758 --> 00:25:10.509
-Just go like this.
-What?

530
00:25:10.593 --> 00:25:12.929
-[blows] That's the secret.
-What?

531
00:25:13.012 --> 00:25:14.013
Yeah. Yeah.

532
00:25:14.096 --> 00:25:16.224
-That's why you're single.
-No.

533
00:25:18.226 --> 00:25:21.145
Wait. wait. wait. Slow down. Slow down.
You should never rush on stairs.

534
00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:26.484
Do you see her anywhere? Kind of forget
what she looks like. to be honest.

535
00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:27.944
Holy shit!

536
00:25:28.027 --> 00:25:29.820
-Hey.
-[dogs barking]

537
00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:31.239
Come on. It's okay.

538
00:25:31.948 --> 00:25:34.408
-What the fuck? Jesus!
-[barking continues]

539
00:25:35.493 --> 00:25:39.372
Okay. come on. I know. That was insane.

540
00:25:40.498 --> 00:25:43.000
No. hey! Gross! Gross. gross.

541
00:25:43.084 --> 00:25:46.045
We're expecting company. Disgusting.

542
00:25:46.212 --> 00:25:48.422
[sighs] She's three minutes late.

543
00:25:49.757 --> 00:25:51.008
She's probably not gonna come.

544
00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:53.803
[exhales]

545
00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:55.221
You don't see her. do you?

546
00:25:55.972 --> 00:25:57.139
She's not coming.

547
00:25:57.223 --> 00:25:59.976
Okay. we... we should just go.

548
00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:02.937
-This place is terrify...
-That is Chloe. so you must be Max. Hey.

549
00:26:04.146 --> 00:26:05.606
Hey... lo.

550
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.234
-Hi. [clears throat]
-[chuckles]

551
00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:10.653
-This must be Channing Tatum.
-Yeah.

552
00:26:11.696 --> 00:26:13.239
[imitating Tatum]
"I'm not gonna give up on you."

553
00:26:14.448 --> 00:26:15.449
Wait. what?

554
00:26:15.533 --> 00:26:19.245
-It's. uh. G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra.
-Right. right.

555
00:26:19.328 --> 00:26:22.790
Yeah. well. I think he's more of
a Magic Mike kind of Channing.

556
00:26:22.873 --> 00:26:25.167
[imitating Tatum]
"Do I look like I own tights?"

557
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.213
-Uh. yeah.
-That might be Step Up.

558
00:26:29.297 --> 00:26:31.507
Yeah. I think that is Step...
I don't know.

559
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.217
Movie confusion. Doesn't matter. Um. so...

560
00:26:33.301 --> 00:26:34.302
Cool shirt.

561
00:26:34.385 --> 00:26:36.178
Oh. this... Thanks. It's a band.

562
00:26:38.097 --> 00:26:39.849
[exhales] Your boots.

563
00:26:40.558 --> 00:26:42.226
-My boo...
-Your boots.

564
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.229
Oh. Oh. yeah. Yeah. They're whatever.

565
00:26:45.313 --> 00:26:46.772
They're really. uh... really cool.

566
00:26:46.856 --> 00:26:49.400
Um. just. like. uh.

567
00:26:50.276 --> 00:26:52.695
-last season maybe?
-Oh.

568
00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:56.073
Yeah. probably.
I got them at a vintage store. so...

569
00:26:56.157 --> 00:26:57.158
Oh.

570
00:26:57.825 --> 00:27:00.536
Nail polish. That's a really nice color.

571
00:27:02.455 --> 00:27:03.873
[chuckles]

572
00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:06.625
-You are "reasonably funny."
-[chuckles]

573
00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:11.881
-[chuckles]
-Um. anyway. shall we...

574
00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:12.965
Mm-hmm.

575
00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:14.842
Ooh. Hold on.

576
00:27:14.925 --> 00:27:16.302
[Max chuckles]

577
00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:21.182
Well. they seem to be
getting along nicely.

578
00:27:21.265 --> 00:27:22.558
-Yeah.
-That's cute.

579
00:27:24.101 --> 00:27:25.770
He's had all his shots. right?

580
00:27:25.853 --> 00:27:29.190
No. no. It's all a government conspiracy.

581
00:27:29.273 --> 00:27:30.441
What?

582
00:27:31.275 --> 00:27:32.902
-I'm kidding.
-[chuckles] Oh.

583
00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:35.237
Of course he's had his shots.

584
00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:39.867
-Uh. hey. are you hungry?
-Uh...

585
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.120
No. it's the best chicken I've ever had.
Just trust me.

586
00:27:43.204 --> 00:27:45.081
-Oh. actually. I don't...
-No. no. no.

587
00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:46.957
Just watch the dogs.
I will be right back. Hold on.

588
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:48.125
Check the health rating.

589
00:27:48.209 --> 00:27:51.087
Less than an A
means potential for contamination.

590
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:54.215
-What?
-Make sure it's...

591
00:27:54.298 --> 00:27:55.466
-Yeah.
-Okay.

592
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:59.261
Two dogs. Two dogs.

593
00:27:59.345 --> 00:28:00.930
I don't even know this other dog.

594
00:28:02.056 --> 00:28:04.308
Okay. yeah. don't touch the bench yet.
Hold on.

595
00:28:05.643 --> 00:28:07.686
[whispering] Okay. okay. okay. okay. okay.

596
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.858
-Okay.

597
00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:16.570
-Just move that.
-Oh. okay. well. I was... Okay.

598
00:28:16.654 --> 00:28:20.157
All right. so. rule number one... do not
touch your eyes or you will go blind.

599
00:28:20.241 --> 00:28:21.784
-I'm serious.
-Why?

600
00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:23.744
It's ghost pepper.
You've never had it before?

601
00:28:23.828 --> 00:28:25.788
-No.
-Oh! [laughs]

602
00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:29.542
Uh. rule number. uh. two...
sanitize hands.

603
00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:32.086
-Oh. Yeah. sure.
-Yeah. I got you.

604
00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:35.256
-Little bit of... [squeaks]
-Okay.

605
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.217
All right. Here we go.

606
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.011
Rule number three...
maybe we just. like. feed ourselves.

607
00:28:41.095 --> 00:28:42.138
Can you just try the chicken?

608
00:28:42.221 --> 00:28:44.181
I just don't really. like.
dabble with hot stuff.

609
00:28:44.265 --> 00:28:45.266
-My stomach...
-Yeah. okay.

610
00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:47.017
-Sometimes you just gotta try stuff.
-Okay. All right.

611
00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:51.355
Oh. my God. Oh. my God. that's so spicy.

612
00:28:51.439 --> 00:28:53.566
-[coughs]
-[chuckles]

613
00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:55.526
My God. that's spicy.

614
00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:57.486

Oh. my God. Wait. Wait. wait. wait.
Here. Here.

616
00:29:02.575 --> 00:29:03.742
-Really?
-Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

617
00:29:03.826 --> 00:29:07.246
-[coughing]
-[chuckles] Here. Here. just...

618
00:29:08.205 --> 00:29:09.832
-Okay.
-[laughs]

619
00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:14.378
-[chuckles] Wow.
-[gasping] Why do people eat this?

620
00:29:14.462 --> 00:29:15.671
Okay. reveal.

621
00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:17.715
Super spicy chicken.
it's a natural truth serum.

622
00:29:17.798 --> 00:29:19.717
-It's really fun. right?
-Mm. Super fun.

623
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.385
Well. let's get to know
each other a little.

624
00:29:21.469 --> 00:29:23.137
-Okay. first question.
-Oh. my God.

625
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.806
What did you keep
in your high school locker?

626
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.224
-I don't remember. It was a long time ago.
-Yes. you go.

627
00:29:27.308 --> 00:29:28.309
-No. Yes. you do.
-[clears throat]

628
00:29:28.392 --> 00:29:30.561
What'd you keep in there. like.
all the way in the back?

629
00:29:30.644 --> 00:29:32.188
Magic cards.

630
00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:34.940
-You were a nerd. I knew it.
-Nothing wrong with being a nerd.

631
00:29:35.024 --> 00:29:36.025
And it's not like--
I didn't play with them.

632
00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:37.109
Liar.

633
00:29:37.193 --> 00:29:38.819
-Eat another wing.
-Okay.

634
00:29:38.903 --> 00:29:41.906
-Okay. Okay. okay. okay.
-[chuckling] Okay. okay.

635
00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:43.199
[groans]

636
00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:47.328
-Okay. it's my turn to ask.
-[chuckles]

637
00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:49.413
Okay. uh...

638
00:29:50.414 --> 00:29:53.125
Okay. Oh...
Wait. you prepared questions?

639
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.212
Yeah. I thought it...

640
00:29:56.295 --> 00:29:57.796
What. uh...

641
00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.548
What's one of
your favorite family memories?

642
00:29:59.632 --> 00:30:01.091
-Um...
-[clears throat]

643
00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:03.010
Like. Christmas. I guess.

644
00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:05.971
Well. you have to give me
more than just. like. Christmas.

645
00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:07.515
That's all I got. I'm gonna pass.

646
00:30:07.598 --> 00:30:09.517
-You can't pass. Pass?
-That's kind of a boring question anyway.

647
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.311
-Yeah. I'm gonna pass.
-What's your favorite family memory?

648
00:30:12.394 --> 00:30:14.438
-I said I'm gonna pass.
-You can't change the rules.

649
00:30:14.522 --> 00:30:17.858
Well. I made up the rules. so I kind of...
I can change them.

650
00:30:20.194 --> 00:30:21.278
I just feel like rules are there
to be followed.

651
00:30:21.362 --> 00:30:23.197
-So what's the point in making them?
-Can you just let it go?

652
00:30:29.245 --> 00:30:30.788
Wait. where are the dogs?

653
00:30:31.539 --> 00:30:32.540
Uh-oh.

654
00:30:32.623 --> 00:30:34.124
-Channing?
-Chloe?

655
00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:37.044
-I'm sure they're close by.
-Chloe?

656
00:30:37.127 --> 00:30:39.213
-Channing?
-Chloe!

657
00:30:39.296 --> 00:30:40.589

658
00:30:40.673 --> 00:30:41.674
[toy squeaking]

659
00:30:41.757 --> 00:30:43.300
-Channing?
-Chloe?

660
00:30:45.427 --> 00:30:46.637

661
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.681
-Chann... [groans] Shit.

662
00:30:48.764 --> 00:30:50.224
-Channing?
-Do you see either of them?

663
00:30:50.307 --> 00:30:51.684
-I think...
-Chloe!

664
00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:53.978
[giggling] Look.

665
00:30:55.437 --> 00:30:57.606
-[Nicole] Channing? Channing?
-[Max] Chloe?

666
00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.483
Chloe? Oh. my God!

667
00:30:59.567 --> 00:31:01.485
-[Nicole] What?
-Get away from her. you monster!

668
00:31:01.569 --> 00:31:04.446
[chuckles] Hey. it's fine. He's neutered.
They're just having fun.

669
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.531
-Fun?
-Come on!

670
00:31:05.614 --> 00:31:08.450
How do we know she gave consent?
It's assault.

671
00:31:08.534 --> 00:31:10.911
Hey. it's okay. Calm down.

672
00:31:10.995 --> 00:31:12.621
[gags] It's not...

673
00:31:12.705 --> 00:31:14.873
She looked like
she's having a good time.

674
00:31:14.957 --> 00:31:17.585
-[retching]
-Oh. my God.

675
00:31:17.668 --> 00:31:20.588
-Are you okay?
-Do you vomit when you're okay?

676
00:31:20.671 --> 00:31:23.215
No. I mean. I just. I feel bad.
Like. do you need anything?

677
00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:24.550
Yeah. you should feel bad.
This is your fault!

678
00:31:24.633 --> 00:31:26.343
This is all
because of your stupid chicken game!

679
00:31:26.427 --> 00:31:28.095
Oh. my... I'm sorry.

680
00:31:28.178 --> 00:31:29.555
Listen. I was just trying
to have some fun.

681
00:31:29.638 --> 00:31:31.056
-Oh. my...
-I was trying to get to know you.

682
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.727
So you think burning your throat
on lethally spicy chicken is fun?

683
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.146
Really fun! Psycho!

684
00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:38.981
-It's truth serum!
-It's truth serum!

685
00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:41.191
You know what? I thought you were sweet.
if a bit weird.

686
00:31:41.275 --> 00:31:42.526
But you know what? You're a dick!

687
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.486
-Whatever.
-Lose my number. Quick.

688
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.280
Okay. gone. deleted it.

689
00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:50.242
-[stomach grumbling]
-Oh. my God. No fuckin' way.

690
00:31:50.326 --> 00:31:53.245
-[Channing whining]
-[sighs]

691
00:31:53.329 --> 00:31:55.831
What are you whining about?
At least you got laid.

692
00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.751
-Oh. hey. you...
-[Max] Holy shit.

693
00:31:58.834 --> 00:32:01.712
-Hey. do you know where the bathroom is?
-[passerby] Over there.

694
00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:03.005
-That way? Jesus.
-Yeah.

695
00:32:03.088 --> 00:32:04.423
-Where? How far?
-Just keep going north.

696
00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:05.633
-Is it far?
-It's a good walk.

697
00:32:05.716 --> 00:32:06.925
-It's far?
-Straight that way.

698
00:32:07.676 --> 00:32:08.927
Fuck.

699
00:32:12.222 --> 00:32:15.017
I can't believe this is happening to me.

700
00:32:17.478 --> 00:32:19.813
Dear God. [groans]

701
00:32:20.856 --> 00:32:22.358
I can't believe I'm doing this.

702
00:32:22.441 --> 00:32:26.028
Oh. my fucking God. Jesus.

703
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:28.238
Oh. my God. This...
Okay. it's happening. It's happening.

704
00:32:28.322 --> 00:32:32.618
It's happening. No! Fuck! Oh. my... Fuck.
Are you fucking kidding?

705
00:32:32.701 --> 00:32:34.953
-I'm so sorry. Chloe. We gotta go.

Oh. I'm so sorry.

708
00:32:38.624 --> 00:32:40.668
[Max farts. sobs]

709
00:32:40.751 --> 00:32:42.252
We are never dating again.

710
00:32:44.004 --> 00:32:45.923
Holy crap.

711
00:32:46.006 --> 00:32:47.591
[phone chimes]

[sighs]

714
00:32:53.764 --> 00:32:55.683
I literally...

715
00:33:03.357 --> 00:33:06.026
Okay. buddy.
let's get the hell out of here.

716
00:33:08.445 --> 00:33:11.448
Chloe. look what I got. [laughs]

717
00:33:12.449 --> 00:33:14.868
What do you think? Yeah. check it out.
Check it out. [makes playful sounds]

718
00:33:14.952 --> 00:33:18.414
-[woofs]
-Do you like it? [makes playful sounds]

719
00:33:19.707 --> 00:33:22.334
Yes. this is where you can dig your hole.

720
00:33:22.418 --> 00:33:23.669
Knock yourself out.

721
00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:27.506
[Nicole] Okay.

722
00:33:29.174 --> 00:33:31.009
Okay. Channing. Come here.

723
00:33:31.093 --> 00:33:33.929
Come on. Good boy. Good boy.

724
00:33:36.265 --> 00:33:37.516
[groans]

725
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.730
It's a little fish.

726
00:33:45.107 --> 00:33:46.775
-Yeah. Good. huh?
-[phone chimes]

727
00:33:46.859 --> 00:33:48.318
That's yours. It's for you.

728

-[shutter clicks]
-[chuckles]

729
00:34:00.873 --> 00:34:02.249
[no audible dialogue]

730
00:34:32.029 --> 00:34:35.449
I should have invested in Crypt-Yo stock
when it was cheap.

731
00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:39.745
[gasps] Holy shit.

732
00:34:41.496 --> 00:34:43.123
[whispering] Oh. my God.

733
00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:45.292
What is that?

734
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.634
Wait. is this a room just for a tub?

735
00:34:53.717 --> 00:34:55.719
Wow.

736
00:34:59.223 --> 00:35:00.516
Fuck it.

737
00:35:01.767 --> 00:35:04.394
Oh. God. Ooh.

738
00:35:05.145 --> 00:35:07.898
Yep. Yes. This fits just right.

739
00:35:07.981 --> 00:35:10.025
-[owner] Ding dong!
-Shit.

740
00:35:11.777 --> 00:35:13.278
You must be Nicole.

741
00:35:14.863 --> 00:35:16.114
Hey.

742
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.117
Hi. I'm Nicole. Hi.

743
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.370
Um... Oops.

744
00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:22.830
I was just. uh.

745
00:35:23.664 --> 00:35:25.666
really getting a feel for the space.

746
00:35:25.749 --> 00:35:28.794
Cool. cool. Do your thing.
I respect your process.

747
00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:30.170
Just wanted to say.

748
00:35:30.838 --> 00:35:31.839
yo.

749
00:35:32.798 --> 00:35:33.799
Yo.

750
00:35:33.882 --> 00:35:35.008
I'm Hunter.

751
00:35:35.092 --> 00:35:37.427
Oh. yeah. I... I figured.

752
00:35:38.637 --> 00:35:41.306
-Want to take a bath?
-No. no. I'm good. I'll get out.

753
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:42.975
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. I'm sure.

754
00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:45.894
Because I call this a room for a bath.

755
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.480
Right. Of course.

756
00:35:48.564 --> 00:35:51.191
-Did you want to see the rest?
-Yes. Please.

757
00:35:51.775 --> 00:35:53.569
I show you the world.

758
00:35:55.445 --> 00:35:57.239
This is room for cook.

759
00:35:57.948 --> 00:35:59.950
[electronic music playing]

760
00:36:01.326 --> 00:36:06.123
So. yeah. that is what I'm thinking.

761
00:36:06.206 --> 00:36:08.834
I gotta say. I am vibing this.

762
00:36:08.917 --> 00:36:10.085
Hard.

763
00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:11.962
-Yeah?
-Yeet!

764
00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:17.843
It's the Dalai Lama meets Wayne Manor.
But. like. in an authentic way.

765
00:36:18.677 --> 00:36:22.055
That... That is exactly
what I was going for.

766
00:36:22.139 --> 00:36:25.517
Hey. there's this restaurant downtown
I'm thinking of investing in.

767
00:36:25.601 --> 00:36:27.769
It's completely inspired by ASMR.

768
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.731
You will eat with all your. uh. senses.

769
00:36:31.315 --> 00:36:34.985
I'd. uh... I'd love to take you there.
get your feel on the flow.

770
00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:37.738
Oh. wow.

771
00:36:38.488 --> 00:36:41.992
Yes. I... I'm flattered. [chuckles]

772
00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:45.329
It's the ultimate sensory experience.
It's rad.

773
00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:49.499
Yeah. Um... It sounds rad.

774
00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:52.336
[whimpering]

775
00:36:52.419 --> 00:36:54.379
Hey. what's going on. girl?

776
00:36:55.297 --> 00:36:58.300
Yesterday you were throwing up.
Now you want seconds?

777
00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:01.386
[sighs]

778
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.680
Okay. I'm... I'm sorry.
we gotta get ready.

779
00:37:03.764 --> 00:37:08.268
It's time to meet Grandma and Grandpa.
And try not to judge me.

780
00:37:08.936 --> 00:37:10.354
We can't choose our parents.

781
00:37:11.897 --> 00:37:12.940
Okay. here we are.

782
00:37:13.023 --> 00:37:15.442
-This is the place.
-[air pump whirring]

783
00:37:15.525 --> 00:37:17.027
Holy shit.

784
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.992
I can't believe you're here. Max.
[chuckles]

785
00:37:24.076 --> 00:37:26.286
-Here. sweetie. have a cracker.
-Oh. no. thanks.

786
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.830
-There you go.
-Thank you.

787
00:37:28.914 --> 00:37:31.500
I love what you've done with the place.

788
00:37:31.583 --> 00:37:34.461
-It's always a work in progress. yeah.
-Mm.

789
00:37:34.544 --> 00:37:38.298
-Did you see the wind man out front?
-Uh-huh. Yeah. he... he's cool.

790
00:37:38.382 --> 00:37:40.425
Max. you seem happy.

791
00:37:40.509 --> 00:37:42.803
Yeah. Yeah. I am. I'm...

792
00:37:42.886 --> 00:37:48.350
I mean. Chloe's been helping a lot.
You know. she's pretty special.

793
00:37:48.433 --> 00:37:49.893
Yeah. she's a real beauty. Son.

794
00:37:49.977 --> 00:37:52.771
She's got a little meat on her bones too.
Like her grandma.

795
00:37:52.854 --> 00:37:54.022
-[chuckling]
-[chuckles] Stop.

796
00:37:54.106 --> 00:37:56.566
Is she looking kind of heavy? It's weird.

797
00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.027
I mean. at first she couldn't keep
any food down.

798
00:37:59.111 --> 00:38:00.320
and lately she can't get enough.

799
00:38:00.404 --> 00:38:04.992
Well. let me take a look at her.
Here. come to Mama. you sweet girl. yeah.

800
00:38:05.075 --> 00:38:08.078
-Look at you. You're just so pretty.
-[all chuckling]

801
00:38:09.538 --> 00:38:11.248
-Honey?
-Hmm?

802
00:38:11.331 --> 00:38:12.499
Could she be pregnant?

803
00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:15.919
[chuckles] No. No. that's impossible.

804
00:38:16.003 --> 00:38:17.587
So she's been spayed?

805
00:38:23.343 --> 00:38:24.928
No fucking way.

806
00:38:25.595 --> 00:38:26.930
[paper rustling]

807
00:38:27.014 --> 00:38:29.349
All right. pick her up
and place her over the bowl.

808
00:38:29.433 --> 00:38:32.394
but. like.
in her normal squatting position.

809
00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:34.646
I don't think this is how we do it. man.

810
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.733
It is.
I read this is how they do it in Finland.

811
00:38:37.816 --> 00:38:39.526
Finland? What?

812
00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:40.902
Yes. I read. okay?

813
00:38:40.986 --> 00:38:43.113
Don't be uncultured. Max.
It's unattractive.

814
00:38:43.196 --> 00:38:44.906
You're the one who dragged me
to a drugstore bathroom

815
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.951
to stick a piece of plastic
under my dog's vag... I can't even say it.

816
00:38:48.035 --> 00:38:50.203
Look. I'm trying to help you with
your 16 and Pregnant-ass dog. okay?

817
00:38:50.287 --> 00:38:51.288
I'm sorry.

818
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:53.749
You could learn something from her.
Gettin' laid on the first date.

819
00:38:53.832 --> 00:38:55.709
Can you not be so disrespectful?

820
00:38:55.792 --> 00:38:57.502
I swear I get stupider
just being around you.

821
00:38:57.586 --> 00:39:00.422
Hold on. I feel her muscles moving.
I think she's gonna...

822
00:39:01.256 --> 00:39:03.425
-[Chloe farts]
-Oh. Oh. that's vile!

823
00:39:03.508 --> 00:39:05.594
-Whew. [groans]
-It's okay. It's okay. Chloe.

824
00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:08.263
-She's probably just nervous.
-It's lingering! [gags]

825
00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:09.514
-It's okay. Chloe.
-It's lingering. dude.

826
00:39:09.598 --> 00:39:11.391
-[Sid panting]
-Hold on.

827
00:39:11.475 --> 00:39:13.769
-Okay.
-Oh. she's weeing. She's weeing.

828
00:39:13.852 --> 00:39:15.228
-Oh. she's weeing. She's weeing.
-Oh. thank God.

829
00:39:15.312 --> 00:39:16.313
She's weeing. She's weeing.

830
00:39:16.396 --> 00:39:18.356
-[groans] It's on my finger.
-Did it get on the thing?

831
00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.941
It did. Ugh!

832
00:39:20.025 --> 00:39:21.234
-Okay.
-Here. girl.

833
00:39:21.318 --> 00:39:24.613
-I'm sorry. [kisses]
-Okay. all right.

834
00:39:24.696 --> 00:39:26.406
-What?
-I got good news and bad news.

835
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.408
Well. what's the bad news?

836
00:39:28.492 --> 00:39:31.328
It's the same news either way.
It's inconclusive.

837
00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:32.621
That's just no news.

838
00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:33.789
So what do we do now?

839
00:39:34.748 --> 00:39:37.084
-You know.
-[whispering] I don't know.

840
00:39:37.167 --> 00:39:38.835
If plan A didn't work...

841
00:39:40.462 --> 00:39:43.256
-Hey. can you go up there?
-No man. this is your dog. You got it.

842
00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.050
I'm too anxious. man.
I'm anxious being in here.

843
00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:47.052
Come on. man. Think about it
as a growing experience. you know?

844
00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:48.970
Adding to your progress.
You got this. Here we go.

845
00:39:49.054 --> 00:39:50.055
-Hi.
-Hello.

846
00:39:50.138 --> 00:39:51.264
Hi there. How can I help you?

847
00:39:51.932 --> 00:39:53.600
Um...

848
00:39:53.683 --> 00:39:55.393
Do you sell the. um...

849
00:39:56.103 --> 00:39:57.896
[whispering] ...the Plan B pill here?

850
00:39:57.979 --> 00:39:59.022
Yes. we do.

851
00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:00.273
-Um...
-You do.

852
00:40:00.357 --> 00:40:02.025
I mean. we generally
do a short consultation

853
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:04.694
with the patient
who we'll be prescribing it to.

854
00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.905
Oh. okay.

855
00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:08.156
Um.

856
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.200
I mean. she's... she's right here.

857
00:40:10.784 --> 00:40:13.036
What kind of. uh... Yeah. she's...

858
00:40:14.037 --> 00:40:15.372
Uh...

859
00:40:16.289 --> 00:40:18.250
He got the bitch pregnant. [laughs]

860
00:40:19.835 --> 00:40:21.002
[pharmacist] Oh. yeah.

861
00:40:21.086 --> 00:40:23.839
You're the two morons who got
the pregnancy test for your dog.

862
00:40:23.922 --> 00:40:25.549
Yeah. They've been laughing at you
in the back for the last ten minutes.

863
00:40:25.632 --> 00:40:26.883
-Is that not...
-[pharmacist] Okay.

864
00:40:26.967 --> 00:40:29.219
Do you know how inaccessible
this kind of health care is

865
00:40:29.302 --> 00:40:31.096
to most people across America?

866
00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:32.389
And you want me
to just hand it over to you

867
00:40:32.472 --> 00:40:34.599
so you can put it in a piece of cheese.

868
00:40:35.851 --> 00:40:37.644
-Um...
-Maybe smear some peanut butter on it.

869
00:40:37.727 --> 00:40:38.770
I wasn't gonna wrap it in...

870
00:40:38.854 --> 00:40:41.606
-I hadn't really thought that far.
-Put it in a Beggin' Strip. you know?

871
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:43.400
-No. No.
-No? Yeah?

872
00:40:43.483 --> 00:40:45.110
What was the plan?

873
00:40:45.193 --> 00:40:46.653
Was this the plan?
This was the whole plan?

874
00:40:46.736 --> 00:40:50.073
You were gonna come in. swing hard
on the "it's for a dog" angle.

875
00:40:50.157 --> 00:40:54.035
Not even broach a lie
that it's for a human woman.

876
00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:57.914
And I was gonna be like.
"Yeah. guys. Let's do it."

877
00:40:58.707 --> 00:40:59.708
Uh...

878
00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:01.334
-We'd hoped.
-[pharmacist] Yeah?

879
00:41:01.418 --> 00:41:03.044
Why don't we just go snort
some fuckin' Adderall?

880
00:41:03.128 --> 00:41:06.298
'Cause apparently I can just grab some
stuff off the shelf and give it to anyone.

881
00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:09.759
Okay. I have one solution I can offer you.

882
00:41:09.843 --> 00:41:11.136
We'll go around back.

883
00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:14.890
and I'll give your fuckin' pug
a back-alley abortion or whatever.

884
00:41:14.973 --> 00:41:16.600
-Can you do that?
-No. I can't fucking do that!

885
00:41:16.683 --> 00:41:18.185
-She can't do that!
-Right. Yes. okay.

886
00:41:18.268 --> 00:41:22.731
I can't do that because I'm not a vet.
You need to go to a vet.

887
00:41:22.814 --> 00:41:25.692
Vets are really expensive.
and I could lose my job any day now.

888
00:41:25.775 --> 00:41:27.027
I'm his boss.

889
00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.571
That's terrifying. I hope you don't work
in anything important.

890
00:41:29.654 --> 00:41:31.615
He's spending a lot of his money
on that psychoanalyst.

891
00:41:31.698 --> 00:41:33.074
It's a therapist. man.
Can we not...

892
00:41:33.158 --> 00:41:36.036
-I absolutely don't care about this.
-Just letting her know.

893
00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:37.579
-You need to go to a vet.
-[Sid] Yep.

894
00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:39.247
And if you can't afford that.

895
00:41:39.331 --> 00:41:41.458
you need to get in touch with
the owner of the father.

896
00:41:42.042 --> 00:41:43.168
-[groans]
-Ah!

897
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:46.421
-She talkin' about Channing Tatum's mom.
-What the fuck planet do you guys live on?

898
00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:49.507
-It doesn't matter. It's... It...
-The mom to the doggy.

899
00:41:49.591 --> 00:41:51.551
[whispering] Come here. Come here.

900
00:41:51.635 --> 00:41:53.553
Now... get the fuck out of my face.

901
00:41:53.637 --> 00:41:54.638
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

902
00:41:56.848 --> 00:41:57.891
It's a stupid fuckin' idea.

903
00:41:57.974 --> 00:41:59.726
-I think you gotta call that girl. Nicole.
-That's not happening.

904
00:42:00.477 --> 00:42:03.897
[Hunter] Prepare to experience food
with all your senses.

905
00:42:04.564 --> 00:42:05.982
It's really nice.

906
00:42:06.066 --> 00:42:09.319
Yes. it makes you question reality.

907
00:42:15.158 --> 00:42:16.576
Soup.

908
00:42:18.995 --> 00:42:20.205
Oh. excuse me. do you have a...

909
00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:21.831
[squelching]

910
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:27.462
Ah! It is now time to enjoy
the sense of touch.

911
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:28.755
Okay.

912
00:42:31.132 --> 00:42:34.636
[gasps] Shit. that's really hot.

913
00:42:35.136 --> 00:42:36.513
It's delicious.

914
00:42:37.597 --> 00:42:40.809
[Hunter] The next course is. uh. smell.

915
00:42:42.852 --> 00:42:45.438
[sniffing]

916
00:42:46.189 --> 00:42:47.440
[sniffs] Whoo!

917
00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:49.859
Delicious.

918
00:42:50.694 --> 00:42:52.028
[whispers] Delicious.

919
00:42:52.737 --> 00:42:53.738
[exhales]

920
00:42:53.822 --> 00:42:55.448
-[snaps]
-Oh!

921
00:42:55.532 --> 00:42:56.574
Ooh.

922
00:42:57.117 --> 00:42:59.119
-[crunching]
-Mmm.

923
00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:03.123
[whispers] It's salty.
It's bready. It's tasty.

924
00:43:03.206 --> 00:43:05.667
[crunching]

925
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.086
-Delizioso.
-[crunching continues]

926
00:43:08.169 --> 00:43:09.254
[Nicole] Yeah.

927
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.633
Hey. are you not vibing this?

928
00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:16.303
Do you want to get some real food?

929
00:43:16.386 --> 00:43:17.762
Yes. Yes. I do.

930
00:43:17.846 --> 00:43:19.639
-Well. let's get out of here. huh?
-Oh. okay.

931
00:43:19.723 --> 00:43:22.017
-Two-piece chicken. You bet.
-Thank you.

932
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.977
Thanks for being. uh. cool with this.

933
00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.479
Are you kidding me? I love food trucks.

934
00:43:26.563 --> 00:43:27.564
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

935
00:43:27.647 --> 00:43:30.775
There's something about
their transient nature.

936
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:33.403
You gotta enjoy it while it's here.

937
00:43:35.655 --> 00:43:37.073
That's almost sorta deep.

938
00:43:37.157 --> 00:43:39.951
I'm very deep. Like infinity pool.

939
00:43:40.535 --> 00:43:41.870
-[phone ringing]
-Mm.

940
00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:45.081
I'm so sorry.
This number keeps calling me.

941
00:43:45.665 --> 00:43:47.375
Why can't people just do
normal phone calls?

942
00:43:48.084 --> 00:43:50.920
Um. this might be an emergency.
Could you just hold on?

943
00:43:51.004 --> 00:43:52.797
-[phone chimes]
-Oh. my God...

944
00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:55.425
-Hey. So. um...
-Um. yeah. I'll just be right back.

945
00:43:55.508 --> 00:43:58.178
What the fuck? I said lose my number.

946
00:43:58.261 --> 00:44:03.433
Well. I can't when you're gonna be
a grandmother.

947
00:44:03.516 --> 00:44:05.810
What are you talking about.
you psychopath?

948
00:44:06.519 --> 00:44:09.314
W... Wait a sec... No. No way.
That's not even possible.

949
00:44:09.397 --> 00:44:11.983
[Max] No. it's possible.
It's possible because it's happening.

950
00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:15.320
That's what's happening right now.
It's happening now. so it's possible.

951
00:44:15.403 --> 00:44:17.655
Okay. well.
Channing Tatum is not the father.

952
00:44:17.739 --> 00:44:19.157
Well. Chloe hasn't been sleeping around.

953
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.409
Really? Well. she seemed kind of
free with herself at the park.

954
00:44:21.493 --> 00:44:23.870
Hold on. I'm sorry.
Are you slut-shaming my dog?

955
00:44:23.953 --> 00:44:27.165
Listen to me.
Channing does not even have balls. okay?

956
00:44:27.248 --> 00:44:29.751
[Max] Hold on... What do you...
How do you know that?

957
00:44:30.335 --> 00:44:33.922
I think I would have noticed his balls.
And the vet checked. okay? He's neutered.

958
00:44:34.005 --> 00:44:36.132
-Okay. well. he has a penis.
-What?

959
00:44:36.216 --> 00:44:39.803
Yes. of course he has a penis.
but you need balls for the penis...

960
00:44:42.639 --> 00:44:44.599
-I can't do this right now.
-Oh. you can't do this?

961
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:46.184
Wait. how come Chloe wasn't spayed?

962
00:44:46.267 --> 00:44:48.353
[Max] Yeah. well. she was gonna be.
She was about to be.

963
00:44:48.436 --> 00:44:52.107
I was gonna take her to an appointment.
and then your mutt mounted her.

964
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.442
-Oh. who are you calling a mutt?
-I'm calling your mutt a mutt.

965
00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:56.569
Yeah. well. it's better a mutt
than a slut!

966
00:44:56.653 --> 00:44:57.654
[phone beeping]

967
00:44:57.737 --> 00:44:59.322
Wow.

968
00:44:59.406 --> 00:45:01.074
Wow.

969
00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:03.284
[Nicole] Oh. my God.

970
00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:06.287
I am so sorry about that.

971
00:45:06.371 --> 00:45:09.374
Chill. chill. chill. chill. chill.
No worries.

972
00:45:09.457 --> 00:45:11.418
-So you were saying that...
-I got an early sound bath.

973
00:45:11.501 --> 00:45:13.545
so I should call it.

974
00:45:13.628 --> 00:45:16.423
-Thanks for hanging.
-Okay. Um...

975
00:45:17.173 --> 00:45:19.426
Let's get down to work tomorrow.

976
00:45:19.509 --> 00:45:20.802
[phone chimes]

977
00:45:23.847 --> 00:45:25.849
[sighs]

978
00:45:25.932 --> 00:45:28.435
Okay. these puppies better not be yours.

979
00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:31.229
Come on.

980
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.317
[vet] ...or a Monopoly piece up your butt.
It happens when you're a kid.

981
00:45:36.401 --> 00:45:38.528
-Uh-oh. look who's here.
-Hey.

982
00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:40.738
I smell a vape pen. [chuckles]

983
00:45:40.822 --> 00:45:42.824
-You guys ready to solve a mystery?
-[Nicole] Mm.

984
00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:44.284
It's like Scooby-Doo.

985
00:45:44.367 --> 00:45:46.035
I'll be Fred. you can be Daphne or Velma.

986
00:45:46.119 --> 00:45:49.622
and you can be a young Abraham Lincoln.
'cause that's what you look like.

987
00:45:49.706 --> 00:45:51.166
So how did you two meet?

988
00:45:51.249 --> 00:45:52.834
-God. Please. just no.
-Can we not do this?

989
00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:54.294
Okay. Really none of my business.

990
00:45:54.377 --> 00:45:57.046
But I just have to say.
I sense some sexual tension.

991
00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:58.590
-You're mistaken.
-Mm.

992
00:45:58.673 --> 00:46:00.383
Not between you. The dogs.

993
00:46:00.467 --> 00:46:01.468
[laughs]

994
00:46:01.551 --> 00:46:02.552
You know what?

995
00:46:02.635 --> 00:46:06.973
I think that Chloe does feel
a little thicc. with two C's.

996
00:46:07.056 --> 00:46:08.099
I know the lingo.

997
00:46:08.183 --> 00:46:10.685
Tell you what. let's get
old Channing Tatum up on the table

998
00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:12.896
and we'll see
if this is even possible. huh?

999
00:46:12.979 --> 00:46:14.147
Yeah. let's.

1000
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.107
-Chloe. come here.
-[Nicole] Come on. Okay.

1001
00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:18.610
Come on up. pal. There ya go.

1002
00:46:18.693 --> 00:46:21.196
Ooh. Well. I'm glad you didn't kill him.
There you go.

1003
00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:22.864
-You were gonna kill the dog?
-[Vet] How you been?

1004
00:46:22.947 --> 00:46:25.158
-No. just shut up.
-Should we find out what's going on?

1005
00:46:25.241 --> 00:46:27.285
-What's that?
-Well. that's his penis.

1006
00:46:27.368 --> 00:46:29.537
And that's a great penis.
It's a really. really good one.

1007
00:46:29.621 --> 00:46:30.622
Not that. the...

1008
00:46:30.705 --> 00:46:32.999
Yeah. the ball...
the ball circle things right there.

1009
00:46:33.082 --> 00:46:34.542
-Yeah. the ball things.
-What are those?

1010
00:46:34.626 --> 00:46:37.212
Oh. fuck me. He's cryptorchid.

1011
00:46:37.295 --> 00:46:39.297
-What does that mean?
-In English. please. What does that...

1012
00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.549
It means that he has
two functioning testicles.

1013
00:46:41.633 --> 00:46:43.593
They just never dropped from his abdomen.

1014
00:46:43.676 --> 00:46:45.595
-What? That's possible?
-Yeah. it's possible.

1015
00:46:45.678 --> 00:46:48.348
Well. good for you!
You're shooting live rounds. buddy!

1016
00:46:48.431 --> 00:46:50.308
-[mimics shooting] All right.
-Okay.

1017
00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:52.894
Are you ready for the next segment
of The Maury Povich Show?

1018
00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:55.188
-Please stop.
-Come on. Chloe. you're next.

1019
00:46:55.271 --> 00:46:56.272
Okay.

1020
00:46:57.899 --> 00:47:01.819
I'd say it's about T-minus 45 days
until showtime.

1021
00:47:03.655 --> 00:47:05.448
You two are gonna be grandparents.

1022
00:47:10.703 --> 00:47:11.704
Oh.

1023
00:47:12.372 --> 00:47:13.790
Come on. Channing.

1024
00:47:16.918 --> 00:47:21.047
[vet] Now. if you want a copy
of the ultrasound. it's just $49.95.

1025
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:25.176
[Max] And then she just storms out.
I mean. she's an awful human. 750 bucks!

1026
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.636
Thank God you currently have a job.

1027
00:47:26.719 --> 00:47:29.180
I'm sure I can be
a single grandfather. right?

1028
00:47:29.264 --> 00:47:31.099
I'm good with one dog. I can handle five.

1029
00:47:31.182 --> 00:47:33.226
Don't worry. I'll be your godfather.

1030
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:37.480
[in gruff voice] May your first puppies
be masculine puppies.

1031
00:47:37.564 --> 00:47:39.065
I'm so fuckin' screwed.

1032
00:47:39.148 --> 00:47:41.985
[keyboard playing]

1033
00:47:46.072 --> 00:47:51.077
I haven't really written anything
in a while. um.

1034
00:47:52.412 --> 00:47:53.913
but you've kind of inspired me.

1035
00:47:53.997 --> 00:47:57.041
so I thought maybe
I'd try to write you a little...

1036
00:47:57.125 --> 00:47:59.252
[keyboard playing]

1037
00:47:59.335 --> 00:48:02.922
â™ª Chloe. little spaniel â™ª

1038
00:48:03.715 --> 00:48:06.259
â™ª Nothin' we can't handle â™ª

1039
00:48:06.968 --> 00:48:10.722
â™ª Stealin' my toast
and stealin' my heart â™ª

1040
00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:13.725
â™ª Buddies even when you bark â™ª

1041
00:48:13.808 --> 00:48:15.226
Or fart.

1042
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:17.353
Yeah. fart. [chuckles]

1043
00:48:17.437 --> 00:48:20.607
â™ª Chloe. every day â™ª

1044
00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:23.943
â™ª We both wake up ready to play â™ª

1045
00:48:24.027 --> 00:48:27.614
â™ª Never gonna say goodbye â™ª

1046
00:48:27.697 --> 00:48:32.994
â™ª To my furry Jedi â™ª

1047
00:48:34.579 --> 00:48:36.122
What do you think?

1048
00:48:38.374 --> 00:48:39.500
I'm sorry.

1049
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.170
[Nicole] Does he look sad to you?

1050
00:48:43.338 --> 00:48:45.381
I hate that he misses that hussy.

1051
00:48:45.465 --> 00:48:47.050
Dude. maybe he's bummed

1052
00:48:47.133 --> 00:48:49.719
because you've basically robbed him
of the chance to be a father.

1053
00:48:50.345 --> 00:48:54.557
You're like single-handedly perpetuating
the stereotype of deadbeat dads.

1054
00:48:54.641 --> 00:48:58.019
Okay. what am I supposed to do?
Max is a complete lunatic.

1055
00:48:58.102 --> 00:49:00.855
Well. you're just mad
because you kind of liked him.

1056
00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:02.231
and he wasn't into you.

1057
00:49:02.315 --> 00:49:03.941
Oh. no. [scoffs] Please.

1058
00:49:04.025 --> 00:49:07.904
Okay. the guy disinfected a park bench
for. like. five minutes.

1059
00:49:07.987 --> 00:49:09.072
like a serial killer.

1060
00:49:09.155 --> 00:49:10.865
Are you really gonna punish your dog

1061
00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:12.867
because the owner of his baby mama
rejected you?

1062
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:15.119
-[sighs] Okay. bye.
-[phone beeps]

1063
00:49:16.454 --> 00:49:19.123
Oh. buddy. what did you get us into. huh?

1064
00:49:19.666 --> 00:49:22.001
I think you're muted. Yeah. you're muted.

1065
00:49:22.085 --> 00:49:24.712
[colleague] Oh. my gosh.
Sorry. you guys. [chuckles]

1066
00:49:24.796 --> 00:49:26.422
-You would think I would know...
-[phone chimes]

1067
00:49:26.506 --> 00:49:28.549
...how to use Zoom by now. Okay. sorry.

1068
00:49:28.633 --> 00:49:31.803
Um. so what I'd love to do
is just jump into

1069
00:49:31.886 --> 00:49:35.098
the customer survey numbers
that came back.

1070
00:49:35.181 --> 00:49:37.058
Um. I know we're just digging...

1071
00:49:40.436 --> 00:49:41.479
Hey.

1072
00:49:42.939 --> 00:49:43.981
Hey.

1073
00:49:44.065 --> 00:49:45.233
Uh...

1074
00:49:47.068 --> 00:49:48.069
[Max] Wow.

1075
00:49:48.152 --> 00:49:49.654
Aw. [chuckles]

1076
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:53.491
He was a little concerned
she wouldn't go for him with the cone on.

1077
00:49:53.574 --> 00:49:54.575
So you had him...

1078
00:49:54.659 --> 00:49:57.328
Yeah. just right off.

1079
00:49:57.412 --> 00:50:00.748
But he's been acting strange
since before then.

1080
00:50:00.832 --> 00:50:03.751
Yeah. Chloe's had a permanent case
of the Mondays.

1081
00:50:03.835 --> 00:50:04.919
Mm.

1082
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:08.089
-Look at them now. [chuckles]
-Yeah. they clearly dig each other.

1083
00:50:09.716 --> 00:50:11.008
-Oh. uh...
-Yeah?

1084
00:50:11.926 --> 00:50:14.178
Sorry. He wouldn't give it up that easy.

1085
00:50:14.262 --> 00:50:16.305
-At least not as easy as she did.
-Ha!

1086
00:50:19.809 --> 00:50:24.605
Oh. Here. It's my half of the vet bill.

1087
00:50:25.648 --> 00:50:26.649
Oh.

1088
00:50:27.984 --> 00:50:29.444
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

1089
00:50:30.278 --> 00:50:33.656
I also found some great podcasts
about raising puppies on Spotify.

1090
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.451
I can share the playlist I made
with you. if you want.

1091
00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:37.618
That's actually really cool.

1092
00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.165
Look. I know how long
this whole pregnancy thing lasts.

1093
00:50:42.248 --> 00:50:45.668
And I do everything alone.
And I know how hard it is. and how...

1094
00:50:45.752 --> 00:50:47.378
Look. I mean. honestly. I could...

1095
00:50:48.963 --> 00:50:50.298
I couldn't have done the vet visit

1096
00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:52.633
without somebody else there
helping me stay focused.

1097
00:50:52.717 --> 00:50:54.051
even if it was you.

1098
00:50:54.677 --> 00:50:55.970
Thanks. I think.

1099
00:50:56.554 --> 00:51:00.349
[sighs] And I've been reading online
about the mother's emotional well-being

1100
00:51:00.433 --> 00:51:02.560
during the pregnancy
and how it can affect the puppies.

1101
00:51:02.643 --> 00:51:06.439
And. I mean.
look how happy they are together. so...

1102
00:51:07.523 --> 00:51:12.236
I don't know. what if we. as friends.
got them together for a few playdates?

1103
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.321
Just until the delivery?

1104
00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:16.449
And. I don't know. we can just.
like. drop them off somewhere.

1105
00:51:16.532 --> 00:51:19.285
I definitely do not want you
sticking around my place.

1106
00:51:19.368 --> 00:51:20.953
Well. yeah.
I don't want you at my place either.

1107
00:51:21.037 --> 00:51:22.288
Okay. cool. great.

1108
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:25.374
Then we can choose some place neutral
to let them meet up.

1109
00:51:25.458 --> 00:51:26.626
Does that work for you?

1110
00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:29.462
I mean. I guess we'll be
doing it for the kids. right?

1111
00:51:31.631 --> 00:51:35.051
[narrator]
You don't deliver the puppies. Mom does.

1112
00:51:35.134 --> 00:51:38.054
Nature takes absolute control
of everything

1113
00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:40.848
and it all runs smoothly. But...

1114
00:51:40.932 --> 00:51:43.309
[phone chimes]

1115
00:51:54.737 --> 00:51:56.656
It's nice to get that cone off. huh?

1116
00:51:56.739 --> 00:51:58.157
That thing sucked.

1117
00:51:58.908 --> 00:52:00.493
-Hi. Sorry.
-Hey.

1118
00:52:00.576 --> 00:52:02.995
We. uh. we got a little lost. Um...

1119
00:52:03.079 --> 00:52:05.039
-I've never been here before. so...
-Oh.

1120
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:07.959
Hi. Chloe. Oh. she's getting hefty.

1121
00:52:08.042 --> 00:52:09.377
Hefty girl.

1122
00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.588
Wait. you've lived here your entire life
and you've never been to Discovery Park?

1123
00:52:12.672 --> 00:52:14.590
How is that even possible?

1124
00:52:14.674 --> 00:52:17.134
Strangers. bacteria. wild animals.

1125
00:52:17.218 --> 00:52:21.097
But I brought a first-aid kit
and bear repellent. non-toxic. [exhales]

1126
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.558
-Very prepared. All right.
-Yeah. I try to be prepared.

1127
00:52:23.641 --> 00:52:25.726
I take it you're not
a big hiker then. huh?

1128
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:26.894
No. I can hang.

1129
00:52:29.355 --> 00:52:30.523
Nice cardigan.

1130
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.610
Thanks. I didn't know
I was supposed to dress like Danny Zuko.

1131
00:52:35.945 --> 00:52:37.405
This is amazing.

1132
00:52:38.114 --> 00:52:41.534
I could just sit here and chill.

1133
00:52:42.243 --> 00:52:45.329
Yeah. It's my thinking spot.

1134
00:52:45.413 --> 00:52:47.164
It gives me good vibes.

1135
00:52:47.248 --> 00:52:49.917
Well. thanks for sharing
your spot with me... us.

1136
00:52:51.252 --> 00:52:52.795
[Max sighs]

1137
00:52:52.879 --> 00:52:53.921
You're welcome.

1138
00:52:57.717 --> 00:52:59.510
-Oh. shit.
-What?

1139
00:53:00.428 --> 00:53:02.805
I just finished all my water
and I forgot to bring them some.

1140
00:53:02.889 --> 00:53:04.181
Oh.

1141
00:53:04.265 --> 00:53:06.893
I swear. I'm such
a selfish asshole sometimes.

1142
00:53:06.976 --> 00:53:08.895
No. you're not. Here. I got it.

1143
00:53:09.979 --> 00:53:12.857
-Got it. It's BPA-free. don't worry.
-Oh.

1144
00:53:13.649 --> 00:53:15.651
Of course. I could only assume.

1145
00:53:15.735 --> 00:53:18.070
Here you go. guys! Here you go.

1146
00:53:18.154 --> 00:53:20.406
[light music playing]

1147
00:53:23.826 --> 00:53:25.494
[knocking at door]

1148
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:36.923
Shit. what am I gonna do?

1149
00:53:41.636 --> 00:53:44.972
Okay. make sure you behave yourself.
He's doing us a big favor.

1150
00:53:45.056 --> 00:53:47.141
-[knocking on door]
-[inhales deeply] Okay.

1151
00:53:48.267 --> 00:53:49.435
-Hey.
-Hey.

1152
00:53:49.518 --> 00:53:51.479
Hi. Okay. come on in. [clears throat]

1153
00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:54.815
Um. I'm gonna need you
to put this on. if that's...

1154
00:53:56.442 --> 00:53:57.985
-Really?
-Yeah. just in the house.

1155
00:53:58.569 --> 00:53:59.779
-Okay.
-Sorry.

1156
00:53:59.862 --> 00:54:01.781
-[grunts]
-Do it quickly. if that's okay.

1157
00:54:05.868 --> 00:54:08.621
[chuckling] I'm just kidding.
You don't have to wear that.

1158
00:54:09.372 --> 00:54:10.373
You don't have to wear that.

1159
00:54:10.456 --> 00:54:13.417
Would've been reasonably funny if
I weren't being threatened with eviction.

1160
00:54:13.501 --> 00:54:15.503
-Yeah. no.
-They gave me two days...

1161
00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:17.630
You are gonna have to take
your shoes off though. For real.

1162
00:54:17.713 --> 00:54:19.590
-They gave me two days to decide.
-Yeah.

1163
00:54:19.674 --> 00:54:21.884
Me or Channing has to go. [sighs]

1164
00:54:21.968 --> 00:54:25.388
And I'm really sorry. I just need a little
more time to figure out where to move.

1165
00:54:25.471 --> 00:54:28.891
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Thank you for letting him stay.

1166
00:54:28.975 --> 00:54:32.853
Yeah. I mean. it's a big step for me.
but it's what's best right now.

1167
00:54:32.937 --> 00:54:35.439
-You know. for both of them. so...
-[gasps] Whoa.

1168
00:54:35.523 --> 00:54:36.774
Just gonna have to... What?

1169
00:54:36.857 --> 00:54:38.609
Wait. is this really from The Godfather?

1170
00:54:38.693 --> 00:54:40.277
Uh. well. technically it is. but...

1171
00:54:40.361 --> 00:54:42.196
That is my all-time favorite movie.

1172
00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:45.241
-Which part?
-Not Part III. that's for damn sure.

1173
00:54:45.324 --> 00:54:47.535
-Yeah. Wait. don't touch it!
-Jeez!

1174
00:54:47.618 --> 00:54:49.870
-I'm sorry. I just...
-I didn't. Just...

1175
00:54:49.954 --> 00:54:51.288
-You were going to.
-Oh.

1176
00:54:51.372 --> 00:54:52.415
Oh. oh. oh.

1177
00:54:52.498 --> 00:54:53.499
Yeah?

1178
00:54:53.582 --> 00:54:57.253
Will you hook this up
to your Wi-Fi for me?

1179
00:54:57.336 --> 00:54:59.005
Just so I can make sure he's okay.

1180
00:54:59.088 --> 00:55:00.589
Uh. well. I can't let you on my network.

1181
00:55:01.215 --> 00:55:02.216
Why?

1182
00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:03.884
I'd have to give you my password.

1183
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.888
-And what if you see me in my underwear?
-Mm. That is not a vision that I need.

1184
00:55:07.972 --> 00:55:09.932
Just please hook it up. just at night.

1185
00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:12.643
Anything else of mine
you'd like to take over?

1186
00:55:12.727 --> 00:55:15.980
Channing is used to his things.
so this will just...

1187
00:55:16.063 --> 00:55:17.815
-Well. it doesn't have to...
-...get him acclimated.

1188
00:55:17.898 --> 00:55:20.276
-He likes them spread out?
-Wait. where is Channing?

1189
00:55:20.359 --> 00:55:22.486
-I don't know.
-Ooh. I bet he's marking.

1190
00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:23.946
You don't think he is. do you?

1191
00:55:27.366 --> 00:55:30.578

1193
00:55:41.964 --> 00:55:43.466
Really?

1194
00:55:44.508 --> 00:55:46.886
[phone ringing]

1195
00:55:46.969 --> 00:55:48.345
What happened? Is he okay?

1196
00:55:48.429 --> 00:55:50.848
[Max] Do you want to just come over
and sleep on the couch?

1197
00:55:50.931 --> 00:55:52.183
Really? Are you sure?

1198
00:55:52.266 --> 00:55:54.310
[Max] Yes. he misses you.

1199
00:56:03.903 --> 00:56:06.113
[keys jangling]

1200
00:56:06.197 --> 00:56:07.990
-[Nicole] Hey.
-Hi.

1201
00:56:08.074 --> 00:56:11.077
We're having a little family cuddle.
Aren't we?

1202
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:16.415
[Max] What's happening?

1203
00:56:17.083 --> 00:56:18.209
Right. Well.

1204
00:56:18.834 --> 00:56:20.544
I went to the Fremont Sunday Flea
this morning

1205
00:56:20.628 --> 00:56:22.004
and I found all this great stuff.

1206
00:56:22.088 --> 00:56:23.964
What... Okay. Yeah. um...

1207
00:56:24.507 --> 00:56:26.425
Uh. why is it here?

1208
00:56:26.509 --> 00:56:28.135
It's for the house that I'm staging.

1209
00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:30.930
This way I don't have to keep going
back and forth from my place.

1210
00:56:31.013 --> 00:56:32.139
It's just for a couple of days.

1211
00:56:32.223 --> 00:56:34.683
[breathing heavily]

1212
00:56:34.767 --> 00:56:38.312
But look. there's a path.
I mean. it's a little zig-zag-y. but...

1213
00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:40.981
-"Zig-zag-y" isn't a word.
-Why are you freaking out?

1214
00:56:41.065 --> 00:56:43.901
-You've disrupted my apartment.
-What does that mean exactly?

1215
00:56:43.984 --> 00:56:47.780
I don't like junk all over my apartment.
Or people.

1216
00:56:47.863 --> 00:56:50.324
-Um. I... I can't be... I'm gonna...
-[Nicole] Okay.

1217
00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:51.700
Chloe? Chloe. come on.

1218
00:56:51.784 --> 00:56:53.410
Chloe. we're gonna...

1219
00:56:53.494 --> 00:56:55.079
I. um... Yeah. I'm just gonna...

1220
00:56:56.372 --> 00:56:57.540
Chloe. come on.

1221
00:57:00.084 --> 00:57:02.211
Oh. my God. What just happened?

1222
00:57:02.294 --> 00:57:05.089
[Max] I mean. am I crazy?
Am I being unreasonable?

1223
00:57:05.172 --> 00:57:06.632
I feel like
she's being pretty inconsiderate.

1224
00:57:06.715 --> 00:57:10.261
Who brings a bunch of garbage
to somebody else's apartment?

1225
00:57:10.344 --> 00:57:12.471
It's unbelievable.

1226
00:57:13.848 --> 00:57:15.141
[exhales]

1227
00:57:15.224 --> 00:57:17.143
I mean. I know I have some issues.

1228
00:57:20.104 --> 00:57:21.105
[exhales]

1229
00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:27.987
Hey. look. thanks for listening.

1230
00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:31.407
All right.

1231
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:33.617
Sometimes I just freak out. You know?
I just...

1232
00:57:36.036 --> 00:57:38.205
[exhales]

1233
00:57:39.456 --> 00:57:41.333
[Nicole] Listen.
I'm gonna get out of your space.

1234
00:57:41.417 --> 00:57:42.543
Hey. Nicole. I...

1235
00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:44.795
This was a really. really bad idea.

1236
00:57:44.879 --> 00:57:46.672
I've messaged some other friends
to see if they can take him.

1237
00:57:46.755 --> 00:57:47.798
Nicole...

1238
00:57:47.882 --> 00:57:50.634
I am sorry.

1239
00:57:50.718 --> 00:57:51.802
Um...

1240
00:57:51.886 --> 00:57:56.348
I have my own issues
and I'm trying to work on them.

1241
00:57:56.432 --> 00:58:00.186
-Oh. So it's not all me?
-That's what I'm trying to say.

1242
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.607
I know rules
aren't really your thing. but.

1243
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:09.028
for me. they're how
I get through the day. so...

1244
00:58:09.111 --> 00:58:11.822
Why do you think you worry so much?

1245
00:58:11.906 --> 00:58:14.408
I don't know. I guess I've always
just kind of been a worrier.

1246
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:16.035
Even when you were a kid?

1247
00:58:16.118 --> 00:58:20.706
I used to drive my parents crazy
with all my thoughts of bad shit.

1248
00:58:21.916 --> 00:58:24.960
It's created a bit of loneliness.

1249
00:58:25.461 --> 00:58:28.797
Yeah. and then I chose
to pursue music. which was stupid

1250
00:58:28.881 --> 00:58:31.425
because. you know.
it sets you up for a lot of judgment.

1251
00:58:31.508 --> 00:58:33.302
-And people really do judge.
-Yeah.

1252
00:58:33.385 --> 00:58:35.304
Um... [snaps fingers]

1253
00:58:35.387 --> 00:58:37.848
So. yeah. that kind of messed with
my whole confidence thing.

1254
00:58:37.932 --> 00:58:40.017
-Yeah. I bet.
-Yeah.

1255
00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.436
Then I met a girl who. uh...

1256
00:58:44.063 --> 00:58:46.190
didn't really care about my issues.

1257
00:58:46.273 --> 00:58:50.527
She seemed to love me
for who I was. which was cool.

1258
00:58:50.611 --> 00:58:52.196
Really cool. in fact.

1259
00:58:52.279 --> 00:58:56.158
And I was. um...
I was gonna propose to her.

1260
00:58:56.242 --> 00:58:57.952
-Oh. wow!
-Mm-hmm.

1261
00:58:58.953 --> 00:59:01.789
Until I got COVID.

1262
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:05.042
Fr... Um. from her.

1263
00:59:05.876 --> 00:59:09.129
-Okay.
-Which she got from a dude.

1264
00:59:09.213 --> 00:59:10.631
Oh.

1265
00:59:10.714 --> 00:59:13.050
-Oh. no! She was cheating on you?
-Yeah.

1266
00:59:13.634 --> 00:59:18.389
So. you know. I quarantined. um. solo
for. like. two years.

1267
00:59:18.472 --> 00:59:20.724
But I actually really liked being alone.
you know?

1268
00:59:20.808 --> 00:59:23.310
I'm better off by myself. I've realized.

1269
00:59:23.394 --> 00:59:28.691
But it. you know.
perhaps explains my. uh. lameness.

1270
00:59:28.774 --> 00:59:29.900
Max.

1271
00:59:30.693 --> 00:59:33.529
Hey. I do not think you're lame.

1272

00:59:36.115 --> 00:59:38.993

getting to know you.

Seriously.

1276
00:59:43.956 --> 00:59:45.499
And I will... Oh.

-I'm sorry.

-No. I thought...
-No. I...

1279
00:59:50.963 --> 00:59:53.132
-Sorry. I was trying to lean...
-No. I'm sorry.

1280
00:59:53.215 --> 00:59:54.216
-Don't be sorry.
-Why would you say sorry?

1281
00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:56.343
-I just kissed your chin.
-Yeah. it's...

1282
00:59:56.427 --> 00:59:57.428
I should...

1283
01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:12.401
Look. I'm sorry
for taking over your sanctuary.

1284
01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:14.153
-No. look...
-Seriously. Max.

1285
01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:16.447
It's really nice
that you're letting me stay here

1286
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:19.283
and I will sign a new apartment lease
right after the puppies arrive.

1287
01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:22.786
And I can even. you know.
help out around the house.

1288
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:23.996
I can cook.

1289
01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:26.081
-That's okay.
-Okay. probably for the best.

No. I mean. it's good...
I mean. all your art is awesome.

1343
01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:30.474
[Max] A little bit of magic.

1344
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.560
Was this your card?

1345
01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:35.145
-No way!
-[Channing barking]

1346
01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:36.355
-It was. huh?
-[Nicole laughs]

1347
01:03:36.438 --> 01:03:37.940
How did you do that?

1348
01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:39.691
That's crazy.

1349
01:03:39.775 --> 01:03:41.360
Blew your mind. Chloe.

1350
01:03:58.252 --> 01:03:59.253
Uh-uh.

1351
01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:01.547
Really?

1352
01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:05.842
Just put it in.

1353
01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:16.728
-[vacuum whirring]
-[barking]

1354
01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:18.772
You should check out the classes we offer.

1355
01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:21.650
Wait. Lamaze for dogs?

1356
01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:39.751
[laughing]

1357
01:04:40.836 --> 01:04:42.713
-Oh. my God!
-Whoo!

1358
01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:46.967
Just put it in your mouth.
Just put it in your mouth!

1359
01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:56.977
Oh. my God! It worked! Oh. my God!

1360
01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.688
-[Nicole] Ah!
-Did you get it? Did you get it?

1361
01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:00.897
I got it. I got it. Got it. Got it.

1362
01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:02.441
-I got it.
-Good job. guys!

1363
01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:03.525
Mine is good.

1364
01:05:03.609 --> 01:05:04.860
[phone chimes]

1365
01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:26.882
[indistinct chattering]

1366
01:05:33.055 --> 01:05:34.222
Happy to see you. man.

1367
01:05:34.306 --> 01:05:35.599
-How are you feeling?
-Yeah. good.

1368
01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:36.850
-All right?
-Yeah.

1369
01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:40.562
I wasn't gonna fire you.

1370
01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:57.579
-[Max] Okay.
-[Nicole] Aw. good boy!

1371
01:05:57.746 --> 01:05:59.581
Good boy! Did you...

1372
01:05:59.665 --> 01:06:01.416
-Oh. wait. Did you... Oh!
-Okay.

1373
01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.626
[Nicole laughing] Oh. my God.

1374
01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:06.755
-How does this even happen? [laughs]
-Hold on. I got it. I got it. I got it.

1375
01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:09.466
Okay. Hold on. I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

1376
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:10.634
Okay. okay.

1377
01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:11.718
I...

1378
01:06:11.802 --> 01:06:13.595
-Sorry. It's...
-It's okay.

1379
01:06:13.762 --> 01:06:16.223
-Okay.
-[Nicole giggling]

1380
01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:23.772
-[phone chimes]
-Oh.

1381
01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:25.315
[Nicole sighs]

1382
01:06:25.399 --> 01:06:27.067
Crap. we're gonna be late.

1383
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.611
Time to go to our class
full of dog people.

1384
01:06:29.695 --> 01:06:30.737
Mm. all right.

1385
01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.407
Wait. Are you...

1386
01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:36.243
You're sure that
that won't make you anxious?

1387
01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:39.871
No. I think I'm good.

1388
01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:55.929
Hello. and welcome to your first
Doggie Lamaze session.

1389
01:06:57.097 --> 01:07:00.475
When I say. "Who let the dogs out?"

1390
01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:03.937
you say. "Ruff. ruff. ruff. ruff. ruff!"

1391
01:07:04.104 --> 01:07:05.230
This is insane.

1392
01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:07.315
-[whispers] I love it.
-Who let the dogs out?

1393
01:07:07.399 --> 01:07:10.485
[all] Ruff. ruff. ruff. ruff. ruff!

1394
01:07:10.569 --> 01:07:12.279
I think we can do better than that.

1395
01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:15.031
-Let's get on all fours.
-[Max] Wait. what?

1396
01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:16.783
I'm not doing it.

1397
01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.493
Who let the dogs out?

1398
01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:21.496
[all] Ruff. ruff. ruff. ruff. ruff!

1399
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:27.127
Yes! See. dogs feed on our enthusiasm.

1400
01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:30.839
So we want to show them
a lot of positive energy.

1401
01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:35.677
We're gonna start today's class
by doing a bit of role play.

1402
01:07:35.761 --> 01:07:37.095
-Okay?
-Fuck off.

1403
01:07:37.179 --> 01:07:42.434
Can one grandparent please adopt
the female urination stance?

1404
01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:45.604
Now. this is a common position

1405
01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:50.025
that a bitch will adopt
during contractions.

1406
01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:51.193
Okay?

1407
01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:53.320
There. Good.

1408
01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.572
I'm gonna go around
and check everyone out. okay?

1409
01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:58.700
-Quick. You're gonna fall behind. Get up.
-Okay. all right.

1410
01:07:58.784 --> 01:08:02.037
Okay. Oh. I almost stepped on your bitch.

1411
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:06.082
Oh. well. what a nice couple you are.

1412
01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:08.001
-Oh. no. We're...
-Oh. no. we're not a couple.

1413
01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:09.085
All right.

1414
01:08:09.169 --> 01:08:11.129
-[bones cracking]
-[Max wheezes]

1415
01:08:11.213 --> 01:08:13.215
-[instructor] How does that feel?
-It feels great.

1416
01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:15.550
Mm-hmm. Okay.

1417
01:08:15.634 --> 01:08:19.970
A gentle ear rub and panting encouragement

1418
01:08:20.055 --> 01:08:22.640
when a bitch is having contractions

1419
01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:25.852
can really help calm a laboring bitch.

1420
01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.270
So let's all pant together. okay?

1421
01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:32.359
[all panting]

1422
01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:36.196
-[instructor] Yes.
-[Max] Yeah.

1423
01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.113
See how he's doing over here?

1424
01:08:38.198 --> 01:08:40.742
How are you guys doing? Good job.

1425
01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:44.955
Ma'am. you need to get your crotch
lower to the floor. All right.

1426
01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:47.207
I mean. she said
you were being a good bitch.

1427
01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.834
-Let's try it again.
-Uh-uh.

1428
01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:52.127
[Max] Did she have to use
the word "bitch" so much?

1429
01:08:52.212 --> 01:08:54.005
[Nicole] You know what.
I actually learned something. though.

1430
01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:55.966
[Max] Oh. yeah? We learned something?

1431
01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:59.051
I mean. Nicole. she was dry-humping my leg

1432
01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.595
and breathing into my face.
asking me to...

1433
01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.183
-Heel. heel. heel. heel. heel. heel.
-Okay. you're not even listening.

1434
01:09:05.267 --> 01:09:06.268
Halt.

1435
01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.353
Socialize.

1436
01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.234
-Rescue?
-Uh. yeah.

1437
01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:16.194
Really?

1438
01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.363
Yes. really. Yeah. really.

1439
01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:20.698
Why'd you stutter? Are you lying?

1440
01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:22.033
What? No.

1441
01:09:22.117 --> 01:09:23.785
You don't look like a rescuer.

1442
01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.287
What does a rescuer...
I mean. I assure you. she is a rescue.

1443
01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:27.747
She better be.

1444
01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:30.082
Hey! What's going on here?

1445
01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:33.502
-This man is a breeder.
-Who are you calling a breeder?

1446
01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:36.006
Listen. lady. Back off!

1447
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:37.340
Jesus.

1448
01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:41.886
A dog's for life. not just for Christmas.

1449
01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:45.180
Yeah. we know. It's fucking September.

1450
01:09:45.265 --> 01:09:46.474
[sighs]

1451
01:09:46.558 --> 01:09:49.810
-That was amazing.
-Yeah. well. we're a pack. right?

1452
01:09:49.895 --> 01:09:54.274
This week has been crazy.
but in a good way. In a good way.

1453
01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:56.943
So. are you excited to be a dad?
You're gonna do so great.

1454
01:09:57.027 --> 01:10:02.490
Hey. thank you so much for today.
That was so fun and so weird.

1455
01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:05.160
Yeah. and thank you. It was a blast.

1456
01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:19.382
Hey.

1457
01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:21.885
Whoa.

1458
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:26.765
-What?
-You just... You look really. uh. good.

1459
01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:28.058
Thanks.

1460
01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:33.897
Do you want to go out?

1461
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.942
[chuckles] Yeah. right.

1462
01:10:37.025 --> 01:10:39.486
No. come on. It'll be fun.

1463
01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.072
Are you... Just you and me?

1464
01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:44.449
Uh...

1465
01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.495
No. no. no. I'm going to meet Shay.

1466
01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:49.704
-Oh.
-Um...

1467
01:10:49.788 --> 01:10:52.999
And Naomi. I think. later.
so I just. um...

1468
01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:55.877
Just didn't want to exclude you
if you wanted to come out with us.

1469
01:10:55.961 --> 01:10:58.046
Just... No. At a bar?

1470
01:10:58.129 --> 01:10:59.339
Yeah.

1471
01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:02.008
-Yeah. no. thanks. Um...
-Come on. it'll be fun.

1472
01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:04.469
Somebody's gotta walk the dogs.

1473
01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:05.553
Um...

1474
01:11:05.637 --> 01:11:09.349
No. just not tonight.
I mean. actually I have other plans.

1475
01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:11.476
-I've got some plans. so...
-Oh.

1476
01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.562
Other plans. Okay.

1477
01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:17.899
-I sometimes have plans too.
-Yeah. I get it.

1478
01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:20.860
You've got plans.
Have fun with your plans.

1479
01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:24.197
I will. They're real plans.

1480
01:11:24.823 --> 01:11:26.282
Okay. my friend.

1481
01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:27.909
[mutters] Stop saying the word "plans."

1482
01:11:27.993 --> 01:11:30.203
I'll be back later and I'll walk the dogs.

1483
01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:37.210
-Thank you for hanging last minute.
-Of course. babe.

1484
01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.754
I can't believe that hermit dude
turned down this dime-piece.

1485
01:11:39.838 --> 01:11:41.297
-He's not a hermit.
-His loss.

1486
01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:42.382
He's not.

1487
01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:46.803
Oh. my God. Oh. God.

1488
01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:49.055
[Shay] What are you doing?

1489
01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:51.599
-Hunter Fosterini just walked in.
-Yeah. yeah. I know.

1490
01:11:51.683 --> 01:11:53.435
I saw he texted
while you were in the bathroom.

1491
01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:55.270
so I responded with your location.

1492
01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:56.980
Goddamn it. Shay. why?

1493
01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:59.315
I thought you'd want a rebound beard
since you were rejected.

1494
01:11:59.399 --> 01:12:00.859
Well. I don't.

1495
01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:02.819
Really? You've changed.

1496
01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:05.697
-That's awesome. Nic. Oh! Oh. oh.
-Hide me. Hide me. Hide me. Hide me.

1497
01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.240
-Please!
-[Shay] Okay. Uh. I don't...

1498
01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.367
Ding dong!

1499
01:12:10.452 --> 01:12:11.661
Hi!

1500
01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:13.872
Hey. Nicole. Yo!

1501
01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:15.832
-Hey.
-How are you?

1502
01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:16.916
Are you good?

1503
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.085
No. Nicole. I am not good.

1504
01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:21.296
As you know. I put my house
on the market this week.

1505
01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:22.630
-Yeah.
-And it sold.

1506
01:12:22.714 --> 01:12:26.009
For 500.000 over asking. all Ethereum.

1507
01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.845
So. no. No. Nicole. I am not good.

1508
01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:32.724
I'm fricking fantastic!
You did amazing! [cheers]

1509
01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:35.143
A drink for everybody! Tequila. eh?

1510

Okay. okay. but if we're on the topic
of bathrooms. do you know what you do?

1611
01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:40.638
You go in the bathroom. and then
you spray that little lavender spritz...

Yeah.

1613
01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:43.766

every drink that's ever
put in front of me like you

1624
01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:07.415

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:36.457
-Dude. seriously?
-Yeah.

1676
01:20:36.541 --> 01:20:38.626
I've got Yelp reviews to read.

1677
01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:43.047
Okay. Come on.

1678
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:45.383
[â™ª "It Must Have Been Love" playing]

1679
01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.071
Hey. Chloe.

1680
01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:10.575
What is this?

1681
01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:16.122
Yeah. I miss her too.

1682
01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:31.345
Do you want to play?

1683
01:21:32.847 --> 01:21:34.181
You're not in the mood.

1684
01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:36.309
I get it.

1685
01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:41.230
Hold on.

1686
01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.149
Don't pull.

1687
01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:51.866
Oh. my God.

1688
01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:09.717
Hey.

1689
01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.888
They want to meet me.
They want to meet me!

1690
01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:30.071
[Sid] Ah. bro. you were doing so good!
Then you lost it.

1691
01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:32.239
I'm not gonna have you go dark on me
as a friend again.

1692
01:22:32.323 --> 01:22:35.201
You know how hard it is for men
to find friends in their 30s?

1693
01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.370
Where I'ma go? Jamba Juice?

1694
01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:39.997
Man. I'm better off by myself.

1695
01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:41.749
I told her everything.

1696
01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:44.835
I told her about getting cheated on.
and she just goes and does the same thing.

1697
01:22:44.919 --> 01:22:47.880
But she never cheated on you.
You just didn't show her how you felt.

1698
01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:49.840
Can you just stop judging me for...

1699
01:22:49.924 --> 01:22:52.009
Me. judging you? You judge everyone!

1700
01:22:52.093 --> 01:22:55.763
Nobody's never good enough for you.
That's why you by your damn self.

1701
01:22:55.846 --> 01:22:59.433
The truth of the matter is.
you do way better with Chloe and Nicole.

1702
01:22:59.517 --> 01:23:01.686
And you need to be honest
with yourself about that.

1703
01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:03.813
You gotta tell her how you feel.

1704
01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:06.232
The chaos of the world is here to stay.

1705
01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:08.484
Bro. just face it.

1706
01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:10.528
Face it as a pack.

1707
01:23:12.071 --> 01:23:13.364
[Shay] How's your furry dependent?

1708
01:23:13.948 --> 01:23:14.949
[Nicole] I don't know.

1709
01:23:15.032 --> 01:23:18.786
I feel like he would be happier with Chloe
and Max than he is with me right now.

1710
01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:21.831
and I still haven't found an apartment
I can afford that takes dogs.

1711
01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:24.792
Are you really trying to tell me you think
that dog is better off without you?

1712
01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:28.003
I mean. maybe everyone is right.
Maybe I am selfish.

1713
01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:31.173
I just feel like a fucking mess.

1714
01:23:31.257 --> 01:23:34.176
Okay. I want to say something to you.

1715
01:23:34.969 --> 01:23:38.264
but I don't want you to punch me
in the face when I say it.

1716
01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:41.392
That happened one time.
Okay? We were five.

1717
01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:44.687
Look.

1718
01:23:45.855 --> 01:23:50.359
since you lost your dad.
you've put up some major walls.

1719
01:23:50.443 --> 01:23:52.194
And they may be really cool walls.

1720
01:23:52.278 --> 01:23:55.740
covered in. you know.
stained glass and vintage fabrics.

1721
01:23:55.823 --> 01:23:57.408
but they're still walls.

1722
01:23:58.868 --> 01:24:03.122
Babe. you really gotta ask yourself.
what are these walls getting you?

1723
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:09.503
-[Chloe barks]
-Who is it? It's so early.

1724
01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:15.384
What the hell?

1725
01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:24.226
Jesus!

1726
01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:26.645
Hey.

1727
01:24:27.688 --> 01:24:30.608
Hi. What? Why are you in a box?

1728
01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:33.319
Hey.

1729
01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:35.362
What are you doing?

1730
01:24:38.699 --> 01:24:41.660
Can you ask your mom
if this is an authentic Glengholm?

1731
01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:44.038
Huh? Where is she?

1732
01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:50.169
That is the Rolls-Royce
of Swedish whelping boxes right there.

1733
01:24:51.128 --> 01:24:53.172
Only the best for Chloe's delivery.

1734
01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:57.593
Thanks.

1735
01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:01.096
-Can we talk?
-Yeah.

1736
01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.391
-Look. I. uh...
-No. Max...

1737
01:25:05.392 --> 01:25:06.644
I'm sorry.

1738
01:25:08.729 --> 01:25:10.272
I overstepped.

1739
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:14.109
Especially after everything
you've done for me.

1740
01:25:14.193 --> 01:25:18.113
and how you opened up to me about your ex.

1741
01:25:18.197 --> 01:25:19.740
And I'm not...

1742
01:25:19.824 --> 01:25:23.577
I know that we're not
a thing or whatever. but...

1743
01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:27.915
I mean. it wasn't cool
and I really regret it.

1744
01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:29.333
And I'm sorry.

1745
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:36.257
Well. I really regret not dealing
with it better. and I'm sorry.

1746
01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.470
What you said was kinda true.

1747
01:25:43.973 --> 01:25:46.141
Yeah. I mean.
you were pretty accurate about me too.

1748
01:25:47.977 --> 01:25:51.814
I guess we both kinda got some things.

1749
01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:54.692
Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah. I'd say we do.

1750
01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:03.534
I really like having you in my life.

1751
01:26:04.994 --> 01:26:05.995
Yeah. me too.

1752
01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:13.919
Honestly. it's just hard... [scoffs]

1753
01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:17.923
It's hard to care about someone
when you know

1754
01:26:18.007 --> 01:26:20.009
that they can just be taken away from you.

1755
01:26:24.555 --> 01:26:27.141
I'm just scared. Max.

1756
01:26:27.224 --> 01:26:28.225
I know.

1757
01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:36.108
[dog barks]

1758
01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:40.946
[chuckling] Are you kidding me?

01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:44.366
[Nicole grunts]

1760
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:47.119
-[Max] I could have helped with the box.
-[laughs] I got it.

1761
01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:48.787
Okay. Chloe. Go ahead.

1762
01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:51.206
Good girl. Good girl.

1763
01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:55.669
[door shuts]

1764
01:26:58.923 --> 01:27:00.633

[sighs]

1766
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:11.852
Oh. my God. I missed you guys so much.

1767
01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:17.816
-Hey. can you take your shoes off?
-Yeah.

1768
01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.109
[phone chimes]

1769
01:27:19.193 --> 01:27:21.028
[Max] These instructions are in Swedish.

1770
01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:24.281
Yeah. we'll just attach
the "golv" to the "vagg"...

1771
01:27:24.365 --> 01:27:25.950
-Oh. my God.
-...using the "ryka."

1772
01:27:26.033 --> 01:27:27.159
[Nicole giggles]

1773
01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:29.244
-Okay. we'll just wing it.
-Yeah.

1774
01:27:30.079 --> 01:27:31.664
I can't read Swedish. so...

1775
01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:34.792
-And I don't think it says "vagg."
-[laughs]

1776
01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:37.086
All right. step one.

1777
01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:42.508
I'm gonna miss this whole roomie sitch
after the puppies are born.

1778
01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:45.678
Yeah. me too.

1779
01:27:47.554 --> 01:27:49.598
[indistinct chattering]

1780

[guitar strumming]

1781
01:27:52.559 --> 01:27:53.978
You ready?

1782
01:27:54.061 --> 01:27:55.479
For what. dinner?

1783
01:27:58.107 --> 01:28:00.317
No. Absolutely not.

1784
01:28:00.401 --> 01:28:02.444
I thought we were just gonna have
a casual roommate's dinner.

1785
01:28:02.528 --> 01:28:06.740
Max. you helped me fill out my U-Dub app.
This is me pushing you.

1786
01:28:06.824 --> 01:28:10.035
All right. I don't want to be pushed
to do this. I...

1787
01:28:10.119 --> 01:28:11.537
Max. you are doing so good.

1788
01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.581
But I don't...
This would ruin everything. Seriously.

1789
01:28:14.665 --> 01:28:17.167
Well. what if something happens to me?
What if this is my last night alive?

1790
01:28:18.002 --> 01:28:19.044
Why do you have to go so dark?

1791
01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:21.964
Because I figured out
that it makes you do what we both want.

1792
01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:23.799
Come on.

1793
01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:26.093
We can watch.

1794
01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:27.720

1795
01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:29.805
[employee] Hey. guys. how's it going?
Sign up right here.

1796
01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:32.891

This is not normal.
This isn't right. This guy's insane.

01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:48.699
He's gotta be. like.

-No. but this is. like. his concert.

[sniffs]

1871
01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:29.878
Do you smell something funny?

1872
01:32:31.255 --> 01:32:32.965
-What? No.
-Oh. man.

1873
01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:35.300
-What?
-I think one of them peed.

1874
01:32:35.384 --> 01:32:36.760
In the car?

1875
01:32:36.843 --> 01:32:39.930
I knew I should have just got
the plastic covers for the seats.

1876
01:32:40.013 --> 01:32:43.392
I think it was Chloe.
She went on the carpet last night too.

1877
01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:48.021
-You didn't tell me that. Did you. uh...

[Chloe panting. yelps]

1879
01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:54.820
-What's going on back there?

1881
01:32:57.531 --> 01:33:00.075
[Nicole] She keeps licking her hoo-ha.

1882

-What do you mean? What?
-Oh. my God.

1883
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:03.412

-No! No!
-Yeah!

1885
01:33:04.579 --> 01:33:05.998

What do you mean. a vet?
[stammering] What about your interview?

1890
01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:15.841

Okay. okay. wait. Where are they?

1909
01:33:55.255 --> 01:33:57.049
-In the glove box!
-Do you need. like. a ginger ale?

1910
01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:58.383
-I don't need a ginger ale!
-Something bubbly?

Yeah. I mean. all I did was
put. like. all your stuff together.

1988
01:38:08.592 --> 01:38:10.969
and I wrote a little personal statement
and hit "send."

1989
01:38:12.804 --> 01:38:14.264
I mean. it was just...

1990
01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:23.356
I can't believe
that you would do that for me.

1991
01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:24.649
Yeah.

1992
01:38:25.734 --> 01:38:27.277
We should have a party to celebrate.

wearing booties and masks.

2001
01:38:47.005 --> 01:38:50.508
No. I... Obviously
I don't think that they will. [chuckles]
