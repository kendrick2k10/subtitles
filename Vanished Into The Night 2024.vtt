3
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.958
VANISHED INTO THE NIGHT

4
00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:32.041
-Where are they?
-Where are the kids?

5
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:33.791
Where are they?

6
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.333
Giovanni?

7
00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:38.083
Bianca?

8
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.458
In the States. I had a career.

9
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.333
Here in Italy.
it was impossible to start over.

10
00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:54.500
I don't speak Italian well enough
to take care of my patients.

11
00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:57.041
What was your job. Mrs. Walgren?

12
00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:59.041
I was a psychotherapist.

13
00:01:59.916 --> 00:02:02.166
Specialized in PTSD.

14
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.500
Here in Bari.
I was just a mom. and I loved it.

15
00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:11.541
But it's been really hard for me.

16
00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.500
In the States. I had a career. a life.

17
00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:18.791
And I miss my friends
and family tremendously.

18
00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:22.125
-Giovanni!
-Bianca!

19
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.500
I know that she lent you
a substantial sum to buy an old farmhouse.

20
00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:31.250
It's something we both wanted.
Not just me.

21
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:33.041
We wanted to turn it into a B&B.

22
00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:34.958
We'd begun remodeling.

23
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:39.791
The capital for this venture
came entirely from my client.

24
00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:43.958
While the remodeling
was underway. it is no secret

25
00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:48.041
that Mr. La Torre was gambling.
accumulating huge debts.

26
00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:51.583
Then I must add that Mrs. Walgren.

27
00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:55.333
having access to certain drugs
because of her profession.

28
00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:58.166
developed an addiction
to opiates in the past.

29
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.333
Allow me to say this. counselor.

30
00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:04.916
My wife had an accident
in the States while driving her car.

31
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.791
As a result. she was prescribed
strong painkillers. which are addictive.

32
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:13.083
I'd say we have a complete picture.

33
00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:14.416
This session is adjourned.

34
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.583
I'll appoint a technical consultant
to examine the profiles of the couple

35
00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.666
and carefully evaluate custody procedures.

36
00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:26.750
Giovanni!

37
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.375
You didn't find us!

38
00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:32.250
It's not funny. okay?

39
00:03:32.791 --> 00:03:36.208
Don't ever do that again.
I told you. the sea is dangerous.

40
00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:05.125
Good morning. sir.

41
00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:07.625
Salvatore. how are you? How's your family?

42
00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:12.416
All good. By the way.
I have some mail for you. Here.

43
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.208
Why do they keep sending it here?

44
00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:15.916
I moved a year ago.

45
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.208
-I'll get it on my way out.
-Perfect.

46
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.583
-Ready for the game?
-More than ready!

47
00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:22.541
I bet. See you later.

48
00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:23.666
Later.

49
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.583
Hey.

50
00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:35.458
-You show up now?
-The kids?

51
00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:36.875
They're getting ready.

52
00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.083
Kids?

53
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.208
Hi. Dad.

54
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:46.375
Hi. Dad. Mom bought me new flippers.

55
00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.625
Good. Got your masks?

56
00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:51.583
-I'll go get them.
-Spare swimsuit too. Hurry up.

57
00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.708
-Giovanni. will you hurry up?
-Hey.

58
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.500
I'm so sorry about my lawyer.

59
00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:03.333
With lawyers. it always gets brutal.
It sucks.

60
00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:17.208
What time are you leaving?

61
00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:22.083
At eight.

62
00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958
Of course. Why are you asking?

63
00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:37.250
-Come and say bye to Mom!
-We're coming!

64
00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.458
Bye.

65
00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.083
When will you be back?

66
00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.791
On Tuesday. Behave. okay?

67
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:45.958
-Okay.
-Bye.

68
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:47.000
-Let's go.
-Bye.

69
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:12.250
We got another one!
It's a good one. It's purple!

70
00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:16.041
So now we haveâ€¦ 14!

71
00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:18.125
Look how big it is.

72
00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:19.208
Go.

73
00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:28.541
Leave the sea urchins. Come.

74
00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:32.791
We'll make spaghetti with those tonight.

75
00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:50.750
Hey. guys! Did you catch anything?

76
00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:52.875
Dad. it's Uncle Nicola!

77
00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:53.916
Hi. Nico.

78
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.250
Hi. Pietro. You came back
empty-handed as usual?

79
00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:59.875
No. we caught 41 sea urchins.

80
00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.291
Great!

81
00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:04.583
-Uncle Nicola. can we get on your boat?
-Sure. you can!

82
00:07:04.666 --> 00:07:07.416
But you need your father's permission.

83
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.083
Daddy. please.

84
00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:11.791
No. It's out of the question.

85
00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:13.708
Don't call him your uncle. He's not.

86
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:15.583
Come on. Daddy. please.

87
00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:17.958
-No.
-Pietro. Five minutes.

88
00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:19.916
We can't. We have stuff to do.

89
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.791
Why? Just five minutes.

90
00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:25.208
Hey. Dad! Five minutes.

91
00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:30.625
Five minutes. okay?
As soon as I'm done. we're leaving.

92
00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:32.333
Sorry. but I'm busy.

93
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.208
Of course.

94
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:38.125
Come on. kids! Let's go!

95
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:42.333
Hey! That's a scorpion fish.
It stings. Don't touch it.

96
00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:46.291
This is a monkfish. It's ugly but tasty.

97
00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:48.583
Then we have sea bass. mullets.

98
00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:53.666
And this one here is my masterpiece.

99
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.458
-See?
-It's scary.

100
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.291
Your boat's much bigger than Daddy's.
Lucky you.

101
00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:08.500
-Hey. Pietro.
-Yeah?

102
00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:11.166
Come watch the game at my place tonight.

103
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.875
I have a big-screen TV.
Friends are coming. We'll cook the fish.

104
00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:18.500
-Please. Dad. say yes.
-No. Nico. I'm taking them home.

105
00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:21.041
Of course. You're always so busy.

106
00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:25.333
Since you became a father.
you no longer have time for bad company.

107
00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:27.333
That's right.

108
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.583
Kids. do you know
how much I love your father?

109
00:08:34.666 --> 00:08:35.708
Go on.

110
00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:37.500
Let's go.

111
00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:04.291
Come.

112
00:09:04.375 --> 00:09:07.250
I was passing by
and wanted to see if you were in.

113
00:09:07.333 --> 00:09:10.125
-Santo. the kids are here.
-Just two minutes.

114
00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:11.708
Go inside. please.

115
00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:14.750
Why are you here?

116
00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:17.166
You know why I'm here.

117
00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:22.083
Pietro. I haven't seen you for months.

118
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.125
Our patience has run out.

119
00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:29.541
Listen. the house isn't for sale.
I haven't finished renovating.

120
00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:31.250
You haven't even started.

121
00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:34.416
I've had problems.
but we're starting up again.

122
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.125
Is that right?
And how will you get us the money?

123
00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:42.125
Renting rooms at 100 euros per night?
It's 250.000 euros. you know?

124
00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:46.416
Listen to me.
Sell us the property. and we're even.

125
00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:50.916
-The house is not for sale. Okay?
-The bank will take it anyway.

126
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.041
We'll see.

127
00:09:54.875 --> 00:09:56.375
You're such a moron.

128
00:09:57.916 --> 00:10:01.416
You can't come without letting me know.
We had an agreement.

129
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.916
You'll have your money by Christmas.
I need time.

130
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.541
All right.

131
00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.333
I got it.

132
00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:17.666
Bye.

133
00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:22.125
Still there?

134
00:10:22.666 --> 00:10:23.916
I told you to go inside.

135
00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:26.416
Go on.

136
00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:36.541
Stop it!

137
00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:40.583
Stay still for a moment. please. Hold on.

138
00:10:40.666 --> 00:10:43.791
Dad. is that man going to buy our house?

139
00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:46.000
What? He's not buying anything.

140
00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:49.375
If he does. can you come back
and live with us at Mom's?

141
00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:54.000
He's not taking the house.
and I'm not going back to live at Mom's.

142
00:10:54.083 --> 00:10:59.083
Okay? Come on. let's rinse off. Here.

143
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.166
Oh God.

144
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.041
-Let's dry you off!
-I'm cold.

145
00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:06.166
Dad. it doesn't work.

146
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.291
Gio. you have to push twice. Look.

147
00:11:09.666 --> 00:11:11.375
-Let's go.
-No!

148
00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:13.875
-Oh God! Wait!
-No. Dad! No!

149
00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.125
-No. Dad!
-Oh God!

150
00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:19.541
Come on. pillow fight!

151
00:11:19.625 --> 00:11:23.625
-No pillow fight! No!
-Come on! Please!

152
00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:26.583
Get under the covers.
Time to sleep. Come on.

153
00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:30.875
Okay. There you go. Good.

154
00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:37.791
-Good night.
-Good night. Dad.

155
00:11:40.541 --> 00:11:41.458
Night.

156
00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:49.250
Labriola is advancing.
He's keeping the ball.

157
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:53.166
Labriola again. He loses the ball.
Paponi passes on to Botta.

158
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.041
Botta avoids Labriola.

159
00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:59.875
Paponi's in position. but he doesn't
catch the pass by RubÃ©n Botta.

160
00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:04.125
Bari is a team that knows
how to retain control of the ball.

161
00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:07.875
Giovinco breaks away
to keep an eye on Botta.

162
00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.666
Maranesi whistles.
Pucino takes a shot with his right foot!

163
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.750
Goal! He scores!

164
00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:21.000
Pucino. at the 14th minute.
and Bari has taken the lead. 1-0.

165
00:12:23.416 --> 00:12:25.875
Versienti wants the ball.

166
00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.875
Pucino. Versienti to Giovinco.

167
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.000
Dad?

168
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.583
Giovanni.

169
00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:35.833
The supporters are booingâ€¦

170
00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:36.750
Still awake?

171
00:12:38.208 --> 00:12:40.833
There's a monster in my room. I'm scared.

172
00:12:40.916 --> 00:12:42.333
A monster?

173
00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:47.625
Let's go kick the monster out.
Where is it?

174
00:12:47.708 --> 00:12:49.000
In the wall.

175
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.291
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

176
00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:06.291
So? Where's this monster? Show me.

177
00:13:06.375 --> 00:13:08.666
There. Can you see the mouth?

178
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:12.208
These are just the branches of our trees.

179
00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.500
It's not a monster.

180
00:13:13.583 --> 00:13:15.208
We'll kick it out anyway.

181
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.750
See? It's harmless.

182
00:13:19.791 --> 00:13:22.500
Go to bed. It's not a monster. Go.

183
00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:24.333
Get under the covers.

184
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:28.375
There.

185
00:13:28.458 --> 00:13:30.375
I'll be in the other room. Okay?

186
00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:33.000
Go to sleep.

187
00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:55.583
Watch out for the ball
retrieved by Cheddira.

188
00:13:55.666 --> 00:13:58.583
They're holding on to it. Cheddira shoots!

189
00:13:58.666 --> 00:14:00.458
Can't get past the defender

190
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:05.041
who forces him to put the ball
on the goalpostâ€¦

191
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:22.708
The ball goes too high.

192
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.083
Double whistle.
The first half is over here at San Nicola.

193
00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:31.541
Bari leads by two goals.
thanks to Pucino and RubÃ©n Botta.

194
00:14:54.458 --> 00:14:55.458
Giovanni?

195
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.750
Bianca?

196
00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:01.375
Come on. guys.

197
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.250
It's not funny. okay?

198
00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:25.000
Giovanni!

199
00:15:25.083 --> 00:15:26.166
Bianca!

200
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.125
Now I'm getting mad!

201
00:16:01.625 --> 00:16:02.708
Giovanni!

202
00:16:03.625 --> 00:16:04.750
Bianca!

203
00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:09.375
Kids. are you here?

204
00:16:09.458 --> 00:16:10.750
I heard you.

205
00:16:28.916 --> 00:16:29.750
Bianca!

206
00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:32.583
Giovanni!

207
00:16:43.041 --> 00:16:44.541
Giovanni!

208
00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:45.625
Bianca!

209
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.416
Giovanni!

210
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:56.916
Kids!

211
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.833
It's not funny. Come out!

212
00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:05.333
Dad's gonna get really angry now!

213
00:17:05.916 --> 00:17:06.958
Giovanni!

214
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.625
Bianca!

215
00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.375
Elena. Where are you?

216
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.708
I just arrived.

217
00:17:28.458 --> 00:17:29.458
How are you guys?

218
00:17:31.708 --> 00:17:32.666
Pietro?

219
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.791
Elena. listen.

220
00:17:37.458 --> 00:17:40.250
Giovanni and Bianca. I put them to bed.

221
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.666
I was watching the game.

222
00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:47.458
then I went back to check
if they were asleep.

223
00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:50.375
but they weren't there.

224
00:17:50.458 --> 00:17:51.916
I can't find them. Elena!

225
00:17:54.291 --> 00:17:55.291
They're gone!

226
00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:04.250
No. that's what I thought too.
I looked everywhere. I can't find them!

227
00:18:09.583 --> 00:18:10.583
Pietro?

228
00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:18.875
It's like they just vanished
into thin air.

229
00:18:21.708 --> 00:18:22.958
Hello? Elena?

230
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Okay.

231
00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:45.083
Giovanni!

232
00:18:47.416 --> 00:18:48.666
Bianca!

233
00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:52.333
Kids!

234
00:19:51.666 --> 00:19:52.666
Hello?

235
00:19:53.375 --> 00:19:56.041
Your children are with us. They're fine.

236
00:19:56.708 --> 00:20:00.541
We want 150.000 euros.
cash. by 8:00 on Monday.

237
00:20:00.625 --> 00:20:02.916
We'll let you know where to leave it.

238
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.333
No cops. or you'll never see them again.

239
00:20:07.416 --> 00:20:08.250
Hel--

240
00:21:15.541 --> 00:21:18.750
Leave a message after the tone.

241
00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:20.958
Santo! What the fuck are you doing?

242
00:21:21.041 --> 00:21:25.166
Are you insane? How the fuck
am I gonna find 150.000 euros in one day?

243
00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:28.541
Take the house. okay?

244
00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:31.166
I'll give you my house.
But give me my kids back.

245
00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:35.625
Call me back. Please.

246
00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:50.333
No. Elena. No.

247
00:23:19.666 --> 00:23:21.166
I'll go. You wait here.

248
00:23:24.791 --> 00:23:25.958
I'll be quick.

249
00:23:29.125 --> 00:23:30.125
Hey. Pietro.

250
00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:33.083
What's the emergency?

251
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:36.916
I need your help.

252
00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:38.625
I need money.

253
00:23:40.666 --> 00:23:44.708
It must be really serious
for you to come to me.

254
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.416
It is.

255
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.541
I need 150.000 euros. Cash.

256
00:23:49.541 --> 00:23:53.583
Fuck. That's a lot of money. you know?

257
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.291
It's about my children.

258
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.208
What happened?

259
00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:00.583
I can't tell you.

260
00:24:01.583 --> 00:24:03.375
Pietro.

261
00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:05.750
You got in trouble. huh?

262
00:24:07.291 --> 00:24:09.791
We used to be like brothers. remember?

263
00:24:10.416 --> 00:24:12.541
Then things changed.

264
00:24:12.625 --> 00:24:14.875
We went down different paths.

265
00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:19.041
Now we're not even friends anymore.
because you're ashamed of me.

266
00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:21.833
You think you're better than me.

267
00:24:22.541 --> 00:24:25.458
Nico. if you can't help me.
just say it. and I'll leave.

268
00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:31.208
I'll help you.
But I'm doing it for the kids.

269
00:24:32.083 --> 00:24:35.250
I'd do anything for Bianca and Giovanni.

270
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:40.458
Butâ€¦ you have to do a simple job for me.

271
00:24:40.541 --> 00:24:42.041
Then I'll give you that money.

272
00:24:44.291 --> 00:24:45.166
What job?

273
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:48.500
A job. If you don't work.
you won't make money.

274
00:24:49.125 --> 00:24:52.208
I can give you the cash
by tomorrow morning.

275
00:24:54.125 --> 00:24:56.041
But I need your dinghy.

276
00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:59.416
You have to go to Greece.
beyond the Strait of Otranto.

277
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.583
Three hours by boat. Ever been?

278
00:25:03.916 --> 00:25:06.250
Yes. Many times. Where. exactly?

279
00:25:06.333 --> 00:25:09.041
I'll send you the coordinates later. okay?

280
00:25:09.125 --> 00:25:10.500
You'll leave at sunset.

281
00:25:10.583 --> 00:25:14.916
You'll get to a small harbor
with a tavern. You can't miss it.

282
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:18.375
You'll sit down.

283
00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:21.208
And that's it.

284
00:25:22.416 --> 00:25:23.375
That's it?

285
00:25:23.458 --> 00:25:25.333
That's it. You relax.

286
00:25:25.416 --> 00:25:26.666
Eat something.

287
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.208
They make amazing moussaka there.

288
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.875
Then you'll wait.
without talking to anyone.

289
00:25:33.833 --> 00:25:36.583
Someone will get in touch.

290
00:25:36.666 --> 00:25:38.958
-Someone?
-Don't stress out. Pietro.

291
00:25:39.041 --> 00:25:43.958
Someone will get in touch.
Just follow their instructions. Okay?

292
00:25:45.458 --> 00:25:49.333
Then they'll load the goods
onto the dinghy.

293
00:25:52.125 --> 00:25:54.833
Nico. I am a father. I have two kids.

294
00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:58.166
You're right. I'm sorry.

295
00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:01.000
I forgot.

296
00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:05.125
You're an exemplary father. right?

297
00:26:07.375 --> 00:26:08.916
-I try to be.
-Yeah.

298
00:26:09.708 --> 00:26:13.625
I know. but you came here
at the right time. you see?

299
00:26:13.708 --> 00:26:15.458
Your boat's clean.

300
00:26:16.416 --> 00:26:18.208
You're clean.

301
00:26:19.083 --> 00:26:19.958
Right?

302
00:26:22.541 --> 00:26:24.416
It's not like you have options.

303
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.875
Okay.

304
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:31.833
Good.

305
00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:37.625
Once the goods are loaded.
I'll make a payment in cryptocurrency.

306
00:26:37.708 --> 00:26:41.041
They'll check on their cell phone.
and it'll be done.

307
00:26:41.125 --> 00:26:44.291
Three hours later. you'll be home.
It's that simple.

308
00:26:46.791 --> 00:26:48.916
I want half now and half later.

309
00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:53.208
Let's do it later. It's better.

310
00:26:55.583 --> 00:26:56.541
Nico.

311
00:26:57.583 --> 00:26:59.500
What you're asking me to do is dangerous.

312
00:26:59.583 --> 00:27:02.000
It's dangerous for me. No?

313
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.916
You're just a rookie.
You've never done anything like this.

314
00:27:08.083 --> 00:27:10.708
Anyway. if you don't want to do itâ€¦

315
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.833
I'm in.

316
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.833
Give me your phone.

317
00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:23.708
Why?

318
00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:26.958
Ever heard of cell towers? Phone tracking?

319
00:27:27.041 --> 00:27:29.750
See? You don't know shit about this.

320
00:27:32.291 --> 00:27:34.625
And turn off the GPS on your boat.

321
00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:22.791
You know it wouldn't help. Come.

322
00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:36.416
Let's go.

323
00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:05.166
Bye.

324
00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:50.916
-Italian?
-Yes.

325
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.583
-Here.
-Thank you.

326
00:34:56.041 --> 00:34:58.125
-Just you?
-Yes. just me.

327
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:05.916
One moment.

328
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.541
Excuse me.

329
00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:04.750
Is this the only restaurant on the island?

330
00:37:04.833 --> 00:37:07.875
We're the only ones here. Just Poseidon.

331
00:37:09.166 --> 00:37:13.208
-Do you like this place?
-It's wonderful. The sea is amazing.

332
00:37:13.291 --> 00:37:15.666
Excuse me. I'm Italian too.

333
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.666
I dropped my phone in the water.

334
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:21.000
I have to call my wife. It's urgent.

335
00:37:21.083 --> 00:37:22.791
Any chance you'd let me make a call?

336
00:37:26.291 --> 00:37:27.208
Here.

337
00:37:27.916 --> 00:37:29.791
Thanks. I'll give it right back.

338
00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:30.916
Thanks.

339
00:37:57.583 --> 00:37:58.541
Elena.

340
00:37:59.666 --> 00:38:04.375
Listen. I've been waiting for hours.
but no one showed up.

341
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.291
Maybe something happened.
Maybe Nicola changed his mind.

342
00:38:09.583 --> 00:38:12.041
I don't have my phone with his number.

343
00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:14.958
Call him. Ask him what I'm supposed to do.

344
00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:17.166
Why aren't you picking up?

345
00:38:17.916 --> 00:38:19.708
Keep your phone close. I'll call back.

346
00:38:36.208 --> 00:38:37.708
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

347
00:38:37.791 --> 00:38:38.833
Thanks a lot.

348
00:38:50.708 --> 00:38:53.166
-Can I have the check. please?
-Coming.

349
00:39:01.416 --> 00:39:02.500
Keep the change.

350
00:39:02.583 --> 00:39:04.041
-Thanks a lot.
-Thanks.

351
00:39:11.041 --> 00:39:14.666
GO BACK HOME NOW

352
00:40:27.375 --> 00:40:30.041
Let's make it quick. Come on.

353
00:40:31.666 --> 00:40:34.500
Okay? Do you know where to put this?

354
00:40:34.583 --> 00:40:35.666
-Do you?
-Yes.

355
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:39.041
Speak up! Say your name
and that you got everything.

356
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.250
I'm Pietro. I got everything.

357
00:40:42.333 --> 00:40:45.291
Okay. Now we have to wait for the payment.

358
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.041
I can call Nicola.

359
00:41:06.625 --> 00:41:07.583
Shut up!

360
00:41:22.666 --> 00:41:23.875
Let me call Nicola.

361
00:41:27.083 --> 00:41:28.833
I said shut up!

362
00:41:49.541 --> 00:41:50.541
Leave!

363
00:43:29.375 --> 00:43:32.208
Oh no!

364
00:45:09.916 --> 00:45:11.500
Mayday.

365
00:45:12.083 --> 00:45:16.791
Boat Santa Lucia. Do you copy?

366
00:45:16.875 --> 00:45:19.416
I need assistance with engine failure.

367
00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:23.708
Mayday. Boat Santa Lucia.

368
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:27.208
-I need assistance.
-For mayday calls. use channel 16.

369
00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:30.916
This is Otranto Coast Guard.
Please switch to channel 12.

370
00:45:34.958 --> 00:45:37.333
Boat Santa Lucia from Circomare Otranto.

371
00:45:37.416 --> 00:45:39.875
How many people on board? Any injured?

372
00:45:39.958 --> 00:45:41.708
Do you see flames around you?

373
00:45:42.875 --> 00:45:45.833
No injured. No flames.
I'm the only one on board.

374
00:45:45.916 --> 00:45:50.041
Copy. Please provide the coordinates
of your position.

375
00:45:51.041 --> 00:45:52.416
Right away.

376
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.875
-Is everything okay?
-I'm fine.

377
00:47:53.583 --> 00:47:55.333
-Thanks for coming.
-It's our duty.

378
00:47:55.416 --> 00:47:58.583
-Anything else happen in the meantime?
-Nothing.

379
00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:01.750
Sergeant. check if the boat
is taking on water.

380
00:48:01.833 --> 00:48:02.833
On it.

381
00:48:35.833 --> 00:48:37.666
No sign of leaking at the bow.

382
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:39.708
-Take a look at the engine.
-Yes.

383
00:48:40.291 --> 00:48:42.875
-The sergeant is a mechanic.
-Good to know.

384
00:48:42.958 --> 00:48:45.041
Has this ever happened before?

385
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.166
No. First time.

386
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:51.250
May I have your boat license
and registration?

387
00:48:52.458 --> 00:48:53.666
-Sure.
-Thanks.

388
00:48:59.375 --> 00:49:00.250
Here.

389
00:49:01.666 --> 00:49:02.916
What happened there?

390
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.375
Nothing. I hurt myself
while trying to repair the engine.

391
00:49:06.458 --> 00:49:08.875
-Do you need medical attention?
-No. thanks.

392
00:49:08.958 --> 00:49:11.000
Why are you out here at night?

393
00:49:12.916 --> 00:49:15.000
-I was fishing.
-I see.

394
00:49:18.958 --> 00:49:21.166
You haven't got any fish here.

395
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.750
Yeah. It's been a bad night. actually.

396
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:26.708
Thanks.

397
00:49:31.416 --> 00:49:35.166
The boat can move
with minimum engine power.

398
00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:37.000
What happened?

399
00:49:37.083 --> 00:49:40.166
A sealing clamp
from the power system came loose.

400
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:45.333
Some fuel spilled out on the turbine
and almost started a fire.

401
00:49:45.416 --> 00:49:49.166
Sergeant. stay on board with him
in case he needs help.

402
00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:51.333
We'll go alongside to Otranto.

403
00:49:51.416 --> 00:49:53.541
Otranto? I have to go to Bari.

404
00:49:53.625 --> 00:49:57.083
Sorry. This boat can't reach Bari
in this condition.

405
00:49:57.166 --> 00:50:00.666
Otranto is the nearest port.
Don't worry. We'll go safely.

406
00:50:02.125 --> 00:50:03.166
Go ahead.

407
00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:11.916
Easy there.

408
00:50:35.208 --> 00:50:37.333
Are you sure we can't go a little faster?

409
00:50:37.416 --> 00:50:39.916
I told you.
revving the engine is dangerous.

410
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.958
Don't worry. We'll get there soon.

411
00:50:43.666 --> 00:50:46.875
-I have to be in Bari urgently.
-We're almost there.

412
00:51:12.375 --> 00:51:15.166
-I have to go.
-We need to go to the office.

413
00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:19.500
Yeah. I'll come by tomorrow.
The documents are in there. Thanks!

414
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.708
-I'll wait for you tomorrow. then!
-Okay!

415
00:51:56.916 --> 00:51:58.583
-Bari?
-Get in.

416
00:51:58.666 --> 00:51:59.583
Thank you.

417
00:52:58.458 --> 00:52:59.375
Elena.

418
00:53:00.291 --> 00:53:02.625
Listen. I ran into some trouble.

419
00:53:03.291 --> 00:53:05.000
Nothing serious. Don't worry.

420
00:53:05.083 --> 00:53:06.958
I'm coming straight home.

421
00:53:08.625 --> 00:53:09.541
Okay?

422
00:53:17.166 --> 00:53:18.250
Thanks a lot.

423
00:53:18.791 --> 00:53:19.791
No problem.

424
00:54:23.416 --> 00:54:24.833
Giovanni! Bianca!

425
00:55:24.666 --> 00:55:26.875
Taxi!

426
00:55:42.583 --> 00:55:44.833
Hey! Are you nuts. crossing like that?

427
00:55:44.916 --> 00:55:46.125
Sorry.

428
00:55:46.208 --> 00:55:47.958
-Do you need help?
-No.

429
00:56:14.458 --> 00:56:15.291
Who are you?

430
00:56:16.416 --> 00:56:17.750
-Is Nicola here?
-Who?

431
00:56:17.833 --> 00:56:19.000
-Nicola.
-Now?

432
00:56:19.083 --> 00:56:20.875
-I have to see him.
-Wait here.

433
00:56:20.958 --> 00:56:22.375
Sorry. Hold on.

434
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:31.416
Hey!

435
00:56:32.166 --> 00:56:34.750
-You shit yourself.
-What the fuck. Nico.

436
00:56:34.833 --> 00:56:37.458
Are you alone? Are you?

437
00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:40.708
-Yes. I'm alone.
-Come on. then. Move.

438
00:56:40.791 --> 00:56:42.458
Come. Have some blow.

439
00:56:42.541 --> 00:56:45.333
-Put that away. I've got your stuff.
-Come on!

440
00:56:45.416 --> 00:56:50.541
Let's not talk business right now.
Relax. Come on. Drink something.

441
00:56:50.625 --> 00:56:53.875
Everyone. this is my childhood friend.

442
00:56:53.958 --> 00:56:58.416
We go way back. but he's changed.

443
00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.291
He doesn't love me anymore. Right?

444
00:57:01.375 --> 00:57:03.916
Nico. I almost got arrested.

445
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.833
I'm tired. Check your shit
and give me the money.

446
00:57:09.958 --> 00:57:12.958
Hey! I've only got 20 minutes left.
Please.

447
00:57:13.041 --> 00:57:14.666
Enough!

448
00:57:16.083 --> 00:57:20.541
I'm doing it for you.
You look upset. I want you to relax.

449
00:57:20.625 --> 00:57:23.666
-I'm upset. Yeah.
-Why? It all worked out.

450
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:25.458
Aren't you happy?

451
00:57:25.541 --> 00:57:29.708
I'm thrilled. Check this shit out
and give me the money. Please. I beg you.

452
00:57:31.958 --> 00:57:33.083
You're right.

453
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.250
Follow me.

454
00:57:45.625 --> 00:57:47.958
Here. See if it's all there.

455
00:57:50.875 --> 00:57:53.625
Now you have a reason to be upset.

456
00:57:56.250 --> 00:58:00.083
-What the fuck. Nicola?
-I'm kind. and you treat me like that?

457
00:58:01.625 --> 00:58:03.375
You can't be serious. Nico.

458
00:58:03.916 --> 00:58:05.250
What do you think?

459
00:58:06.291 --> 00:58:08.666
-Drop the fucking gun.
-Hey!

460
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:12.041
You always look down on me.
You're not better than me.

461
00:58:12.125 --> 00:58:15.750
-You made your choices. I made mine.
-Elena made them for you.

462
00:58:15.833 --> 00:58:18.583
The bitch doesn't know shit
about guys like us.

463
00:58:18.666 --> 00:58:22.458
You lost your virginity tonight.
We're the same again.

464
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:23.916
I'm sorry.

465
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.708
-You've got a gun on me.
-Yeah.

466
00:58:25.791 --> 00:58:26.875
-Huh?
-Yes. Why?

467
00:58:26.958 --> 00:58:29.250
-I've had a rough day.
-Yeah?

468
00:58:29.333 --> 00:58:32.750
-I'm not in the mood for jokes. Stop it.
-Let's play a game.

469
00:58:32.833 --> 00:58:36.208
Instead of 150.000 euros.
I'll give you double.

470
00:58:36.291 --> 00:58:41.125
But allow me to pull the trigger
so we'll see if I'm joking.

471
00:58:41.208 --> 00:58:42.208
Three hundred. okay?

472
00:58:42.291 --> 00:58:44.333
Not in the heart.

473
00:58:44.416 --> 00:58:47.583
No amount would be enough to pay you back.

474
00:58:47.666 --> 00:58:53.250
In the leg. Take the risk
of getting a bullet in your leg. Huh?

475
00:58:53.333 --> 00:58:58.125
If I'm bluffing. that means the gun
is fake or unloaded. What do you say?

476
00:59:01.375 --> 00:59:06.166
Nico. I just want to get my kids back.
Okay?

477
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:09.750
-Please.
-"Please. I want to go to my kids."

478
00:59:11.208 --> 00:59:12.500
You're so disappointing.

479
00:59:14.708 --> 00:59:15.833
I've had enough!

480
00:59:59.833 --> 01:00:01.583
Where the fuck is the money?

481
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:07.250
In the bag under the desk.
Your phone's there too.

482
01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:08.666
Shit.

483
01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:16.375
No.

484
01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:20.833
It's fine. It's all right.

485
01:01:37.416 --> 01:01:38.250
Hi. Dad.

486
01:01:41.708 --> 01:01:44.291
-What happened?
-Is that blood?

487
01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:52.791
What are you doing here?

488
01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.291
What do you mean? We're having breakfast.

489
01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:57.541
Today is a holiday. remember?

490
01:02:02.958 --> 01:02:04.083
Oh God!

491
01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:13.041
When did you get back?
Huh? Who brought you home?

492
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:15.500
We were home yesterday. Dad.

493
01:02:16.083 --> 01:02:19.583
No. sweetie. That's not true.
You weren't home yesterday.

494
01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:21.750
We played the whole afternoon.

495
01:02:21.833 --> 01:02:24.916
We watched a movie
and went to bed. as always.

496
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.791
-What's wrong?
-That's not true.

497
01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:28.291
What are you doing here?

498
01:02:29.375 --> 01:02:31.666
-Elena.
-What happened to you?

499
01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.958
When did they get back?

500
01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:37.708
It was a nightmare.

501
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:39.625
The boat broke down.

502
01:02:39.708 --> 01:02:43.958
I called the Coast Guard and took a bus.
I thought I wouldn't make it.

503
01:02:44.041 --> 01:02:46.250
Calm down. Wouldn't make it for what?

504
01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:50.750
For what? For the ransom.
Why weren't you answering the phone?

505
01:02:54.291 --> 01:02:56.583
I called you. and you didn't answer!

506
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:59.250
Kids.

507
01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:11.041
I brought ten kilos of coke from Greece

508
01:03:11.125 --> 01:03:13.833
to get the money to pay the ransom!

509
01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:16.833
I come back. and the kids are here?
What the fuck?

510
01:04:07.166 --> 01:04:08.833
You know I did!

511
01:04:08.916 --> 01:04:12.500
You drove me to the port yesterday!
I went with my boat.

512
01:06:23.666 --> 01:06:26.083
-Good morning.
-Hi. Fill it up.

513
01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:56.083
-How much?
-Fifty.

514
01:06:58.041 --> 01:06:59.875
-Thanks.
-Thanks. Bye.

515
01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:44.458
WHAT TIME ARE YOU PICKING UP THE KIDS?

516
01:07:44.541 --> 01:07:46.958
I brought ten kilos of coke from Greece

517
01:07:47.041 --> 01:07:49.708
to get the money to pay the ransom.

518
01:07:49.791 --> 01:07:51.833
and the kids are here? What the fuck?

519
01:07:51.916 --> 01:07:53.250
What the fuckâ€¦

520
01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:09.541
THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN DELETED

521
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.166
Pick up.

522
01:08:56.625 --> 01:08:57.625
Elena.

523
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.083
Pick up the phone. please!

524
01:10:05.833 --> 01:10:08.541
-Look who's here!
-Dad!

525
01:10:09.958 --> 01:10:12.041
See. Daddy? I'm trotting.

526
01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.250
Me too.

527
01:10:18.125 --> 01:10:20.500
So. today we're going home with you?

528
01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:22.416
Mom said she was coming.

529
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.791
Listen. kids.

530
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:27.250
I came to ask you something important.

531
01:10:27.333 --> 01:10:30.208
Remember you stayed with me at the farm?

532
01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:31.791
Daddy. again?

533
01:10:31.875 --> 01:10:34.208
-I don't know.
-You don't know. Giovanni?

534
01:10:34.291 --> 01:10:36.208
Remember I put you to bed?

535
01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:40.458
We took a shower.
and I watched the game on TV.

536
01:10:40.541 --> 01:10:43.791
Then you woke up and said
you were afraid of monsters.

537
01:10:43.875 --> 01:10:45.083
Remember?

538
01:10:45.166 --> 01:10:48.625
-Yes. Maybe I do.
-Yeah.

539
01:10:48.708 --> 01:10:51.750
Can we have pizza today. Daddy?
I'm hungry.

540
01:10:51.833 --> 01:10:52.666
Yes. okay.

541
01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.708
Bianca. do you remember?

542
01:10:55.791 --> 01:10:58.666
You slept at my place
and woke up at Mom's.

543
01:11:00.708 --> 01:11:01.625
Yes.

544
01:11:04.666 --> 01:11:07.583
Good. Did someone pick you up?

545
01:11:07.666 --> 01:11:09.500
Dad. stop it. Will you leave us alone?

546
01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:13.291
Make an effort. please.
Did someone come to pick you up?

547
01:11:13.375 --> 01:11:17.166
-Someone? I don't know.
-How can you not know? Try to remember!

548
01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:20.916
You went to sleep at my place
and woke up at Mom's. right?

549
01:11:23.166 --> 01:11:24.375
Answer me.

550
01:11:25.333 --> 01:11:26.791
Why are you being like this?

551
01:11:26.875 --> 01:11:29.375
I remember we were at Mom's. as always.

552
01:11:29.458 --> 01:11:31.166
You just said you remembered!

553
01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:37.208
Go. Get in the car.

554
01:14:49.458 --> 01:14:52.750
-Dad. it doesn't work.
-You have to push twice. Look.

555
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:50.291
-Yes?
-Salvatore. it's Pietro.

556
01:15:50.375 --> 01:15:54.666
-Morning. sir. How can I help?
-Sorry to disturb you. I need the keys.

557
01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:56.916
-Right away.
-Thank you.

558
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:58.833
Sir.

559
01:15:58.916 --> 01:16:02.041
My wife is leaving.
but she left Bianca's ID at home.

560
01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:04.541
Sure. Hurry. or they'll miss their flight.

561
01:16:04.625 --> 01:16:07.083
-I'll bring them right back.
-Yes.

562
01:19:51.666 --> 01:19:52.916
I just arrived.

563
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.291
How are you guys?

564
01:20:03.916 --> 01:20:09.166
Last call for flight AZ1435
leaving for Rome.

565
01:20:17.583 --> 01:20:22.625
Last call for flight AZ1435
leaving for Rome.

566
01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:41.291
-Dad!
-Hi. Dad. Are you coming with us?

567
01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:42.416
Hi. kids.

568
01:20:47.708 --> 01:20:48.750
EXIT PERMIT

569
01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.666
Change of plans. kids.
Mom's leaving on her own.

570
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:55.833
-You're staying with me.
-Why is Mom leaving on her own?

571
01:20:55.916 --> 01:21:00.666
There's a problem with your passports.
You can't leave.

572
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:02.833
So we're not going to the States?

573
01:21:02.916 --> 01:21:04.916
No. Actually. I'll tell you what.

574
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.625
Sit there for a minute
while I talk to Mom.

575
01:21:49.916 --> 01:21:51.500
I talked to a doctor.

576
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.541
The traces of those opiates
last a long time in the hair.

577
01:21:56.708 --> 01:21:58.833
Leave. and I'll report you.

578
01:21:59.333 --> 01:22:01.666
I'll have the kids' hair tested
in New York.

579
01:22:05.416 --> 01:22:07.875
What you did was serious. Very serious.

580
01:22:25.125 --> 01:22:26.500
I can't believe you.

581
01:22:27.791 --> 01:22:30.166
You lied to me. You put on an act.

582
01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:32.250
You put me in the hands of a drug dealer.

583
01:22:32.333 --> 01:22:34.250
You put our children's lives in danger.

584
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:36.000
And you blackmailed me.

585
01:23:09.333 --> 01:23:10.541
Kids.

586
01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:16.541
Say bye to Mom.

587
01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:18.500
No.

588
01:23:19.041 --> 01:23:21.375
I don't want you to go.

589
01:23:33.333 --> 01:23:34.791
When will you come back?

590
01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:45.583
Pietro.

591
01:24:14.041 --> 01:24:14.875
Soâ€¦

592
01:24:15.708 --> 01:24:20.708
Since today was complicated enough.
no school tomorrow. okay?

593
01:24:20.791 --> 01:24:22.333
Really. no school?

594
01:24:22.416 --> 01:24:25.375
Yes. and for 24 hours.
you can do anything you like.

595
01:24:25.458 --> 01:24:28.125
Really? What time is it now?

596
01:24:28.916 --> 01:24:30.000
8:00.

597
01:24:30.541 --> 01:24:35.625
So we can do anything we like
until 8:00 tomorrow night?

598
01:24:35.708 --> 01:24:37.250
Maybe not anything.

599
01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:39.666
-Almost anything. okay?
-Okay.

600
01:25:00.958 --> 01:25:02.500
I'll race you!

601
01:25:02.583 --> 01:25:05.208
-I'll beat you!
-Don't run. Slow down!

602
01:25:14.291 --> 01:25:15.625
-Santo?
-Hey. Pietro.

603
01:25:15.708 --> 01:25:18.833
What's that message you sent me?
Were you drunk?

604
01:25:18.916 --> 01:25:22.708
What the fuck were you thinking?
I'm only going to say this once.

605
01:25:22.791 --> 01:25:26.625
-We don't touch children.
-Yeah. sorry. I had a pretty rough day.

606
01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:28.458
-Right.
-I have your money.

607
01:25:28.541 --> 01:25:30.583
-Finally.
-Come and pick it up.

608
01:25:35.791 --> 01:25:37.833
-I'll get it first!
-No. I will!

609
01:25:40.791 --> 01:25:42.041
Come here!

610
01:25:44.125 --> 01:25:45.791
I'm picking the movie!

611
01:25:47.125 --> 01:25:48.083
I will!

612
01:26:09.083 --> 01:26:10.166
Come here.
