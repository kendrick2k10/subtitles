3
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.920
Hey. Son.

4
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.319
You'll face struggle. but have no fear.

5
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.520
Your journey is long.

6
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.560
your burden is heavy. but don't stop.

7
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.520
Your wrist is strong. your tongue sharp.

8
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.360
Hey. Son.

9
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.720
Enemies are mute. their intentions silent.

10
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.560
Speak out.
Your voice is roaring. your anger deep.

11
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.640
Your blood is of my blood.

12
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.320
your life is dear to me. Kutalmýþ.

13
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.240
This is why I spared your life.

14
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.960
However…

15
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.680
what more do you want. showing up here
with your army. unannounced?

16
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.880
I want what's mine. I want my throne.

17
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.400
I'll give you one day.

18
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.400
Take the men by your side. your
commanders. and give me back my throne.

19
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.360
Leave.

20
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.640
I'll give it to you. Kutalmýþ. sure.

21
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.400
But not the throne.

22
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.960
I'll give you what's due.

23
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.400
Long live the sultan.
Long live the sultan.

24
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.360
Praise be. Sultan.

25
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.480
Blessed be the sultan.

26
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.320
I am the ruler of the Great Seljuk Empire.
Sultan Alp-Arslan.

27
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.640
My vision stretches beyond your horizons.

28
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.440
If you long to join my tribe…

29
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.560
my protection will shield you all.

30
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.280
However. if it so happens…

31
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.800
that you choose betrayal.

32
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.640
that's exactly when

33
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.800
I'd feel obliged to take off your heads.
which I'm very skilled at. as you know.

34
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.600
Empress Eudokia.

35
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.640
God have mercy on our emperor.

36
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.360
Georgeus. your servant. at your disposal.

37
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.400
My deepest condolences.
I offer my allegiance.

38
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.480
Let there be no doubt.

39
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.680
Who are you?

40
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.400
Romanus IV Diogenes of Byzantium.

41
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.160
I've come to pay my respects.

42
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.360
Welcome. Commander Diogenes.

43
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.960
I wish you patience. my empress.

44
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.960
The patriarch's brother. He's in charge
of the palace's financial affairs.

45
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.400
To attend the funeral you must
surrender your swords and bows.

46
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.760
Then you can enter.

47
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.280
-Come here. Here.
-Run. run. run.

48
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.480
What's happening?

49
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.920
What's happening. Commander Georgeus?

50
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.800
This is Romanus Diogenes. Arrest him.

51
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.840
Get the empress out of here.

52
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.040
CAPITAL OF THE SELJUK EMPIRE

53
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:38.600
God willing. we shall put an end
to the strife within our land today.

54
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.840
Now. listen well to what I have to say.

55
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.160
There are wishes of my ancestor. Tughril.
that I want to fulfill.

56
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.240
God willing.

57
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.720
under my reign. the search
for our Turks' homeland will be over.

58
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.440
Our raids on Anatolia will continue.

59
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.760
We know there is significant friction
within the Greek ranks.

60
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.240
This is a great opportunity for us.

61
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.280
In time. we will carry the banner of Islam
throughout the Greek provinces.

62
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.280
First of all. it is through Islam
that we shall unite.

63
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.960
The banner of Islam
is to be bolstered by the Seljuk flag?

64
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.400
Like that. Vizier.

65
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.480
God willing.

66
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.760
we'll save our Muslim brothers and sisters
living under the Fatimids' heretical rule

67
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.920
and gather under one flag.

68
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.560
We'll recruit Turkish raiders who are
lingering around to join the Seljuk army.

69
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.200
Vizier. you'll lead our most distinguished
troops and shall set out for Egypt.

70
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.400
We'll stay here for a while and
raid the Greek provinces.

71
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.720
God willing.

72
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.200
towards the end of summer
I'll catch up to the army and take lead.

73
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.000
Afþin.

74
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.440
You know Anatolia.

75
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.160
A little. my sultan.

76
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.760
Gather your troops. onwards to Derbent.

77
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.640
Gather all the Turkish
principalities together.

78
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.960
For a while there have been
troublemakers in the mix.

79
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.320
If there are traitors amongst you.

80
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.720
they shall fear my wrath.

81
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.120
Repent of your sins. Repent.

82
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.640
Why are you lagging behind?

83
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.840
Why must I keep asking you
to pick up the pace?

84
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.560
Is your aim. Aþbörü servant.
to disgrace our sultan?

85
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.000
No. I know your intention.

86
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.720
Your intention is

87
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.400
to anger our sultan and
have my poor soul beheaded.

88
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.600
This I know.

89
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.760
Here you go.

90
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.640
-It needs salt.
-Okay.

91
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.120
Go ahead. add some salt.

92
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.800
Hey. Mahmut.

93
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.120
Grab the fruit. Go take the fruit. Hurry.

94
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.040
Pour soup. Pour soup. Hurry.

95
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.240
Come on.

96
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.640
Let's go. let's go. let's go.

97
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.320
I trust we won't have anyone
taste this food from Aþbörü.

98
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.440
Enjoy. May we savor this abundance.

99
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.480
Here you go. sir.

100
00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.800
Does His Majesty the Sultan
really trust you so?

101
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.800
What do you think. brother?

102
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.400
I've saved the sultan's life many times.

103
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.960
Tell us. master.

104
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.560
Once upon a time this traitor. Kutalmýþ.
raided our land.

105
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.280
I drew my sword. one to the head.
another in the leg.

106
00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.880
and then one in the stomach.

107
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.440
Then. before me. stood Kutalmýþ.

108
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.040
I said. "Kutalmýþ.
you may know our sultan.

109
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.040
but my grudge
is greater than his. know this."

110
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.760
Wow. master. And then what?

111
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.520
He apologized.

112
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.360
He will never raid our land again.

113
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.920
As you know. we don't draw our swords
on those who beg for mercy.

114
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.920
I let him go.

115
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.760
Back to work. now.

116
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.400
Wake up.

117
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.840
Water. Water.

118
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.600
-Help me.
-Water.

119
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.120
Water.

120
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.040
Water.

121
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.720
-Water.
-Just one drop.

122
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.080
-Water.
-Help.

123
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840
Water.

124
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.120
Water.

125
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.520
Get up. Walk.

126
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.400
Give me water. Water.

127
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.920
We're starving.

128
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.840
Water.

129
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.720
Have mercy.

130
00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.920
-Hang him.
-Hang him.

131
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.080
Off with his head.

132
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.880
-Kill him.
-Hang him.

133
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.400
You must die now. Die.

134
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.200
Have no guilt. Kill him.

135
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.240
Take his life.

136
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.760
You're going to die. Execute him.

137
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.400
-Kill him.
-Off with his head.

138
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.800
Hang him.

139
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.680
Kill him.

140
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.200
-Face the wrath of God.
-Today you must die.

141
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.880
-Hang him.
-Kill him.

142
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.160
Execute him! Execute him! Execute him!

143
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.200
Romanus Diogenes.

144
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.640
you've failed to surrender to our empress

145
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.280
and relinquish weapons to her soldiers.

146
00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:31.840
For this you are on trial for an attempted
coup against our great queen.

147
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.400
Before your conviction

148
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.840
you must. before the public.

149
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:44.400
present your defense to our council.

150
00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.360
I'm Diogenes of Cappadocia.

151
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.640
In order to protect our empire.

152
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.000
and just as those Anatolian
commanders who came before me.

153
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.480
I've been battling evil for years.

154
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.920
This is why

155
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.880
my nobility

156
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.320
and loyalty to my country
should not be in question.

157
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.960
My aim is not to kill the empress.

158
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.200
I'm not here to rebel against her at all.

159
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.760
I only wish to lay out the
truth before her.

160
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.040
I want the high council
to take an honest look.

161
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.360
Our empire is in chaos.

162
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.040
The army has dissipated.

163
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.560
Soldiers have no leadership.

164
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.560
Moreover. sacrilegious Turks
present a great threat to our empire.

165
00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.920
And they get stronger every day.

166
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.560
If we don't stop them. it won't be long

167
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.680
before we stumble upon a Turkish castle
on every corner of Anatolia.

168
00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760
A matter of time.

169
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.640
Empress…

170
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.400
members of the high council.

171
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.840
beloved Byzantine people.

172
00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.160
if the Turks seize the Hagia Sophia.

173
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.840
will they not defile our holy temple?

174
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.080
Those days are near.

175
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.880
But I can stop the Turks.

176
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.920
The day will come when those
on the high council will face this truth.

177
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.120
The council's greatest regret
will be my execution.

178
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.160
People should be aware.

179
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.520
Long live the Empress.

180
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.280
Long live the Eastern Roman Empire.

181
00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.560
-He must be executed.
-He killed our soldiers.

182
00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.640
Let's hang him.

183
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.560
-Our own soldiers.
-He must be hung.

184
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.560
Yes. sir. Yes.

185
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.600
Let us proceed.

186
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.320
Romanus Diogenes.

187
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.520
your defense has been
rejected by the council.

188
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:33.480
You are sentenced to 45 days in prison.
and then you will be executed.

189
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.560
Boo. boo. boo.

190
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.040
Patriotic enough to be emperor…

191
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.320
treacherous enough to warrant death.

192
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.400
KAYSERI REGION
AN ARMENIAN VILLAGE

193
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.720
On your feet!

194
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.080
-Leave.
-Eleni. Eleni. Don't take my daughter!

195
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.680
Let go. Let go.

196
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.440
What are you doing? Let go of her.

197
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.120
Let go of my daughter!

198
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.840
Let go.

199
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.400
-My girl. Eleni.
-Papa!

200
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.960
Get up. Don't drag your feet. Come here.

201
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.360
-Papa. Papa.
-Move it. Get up.

202
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.000
-I said get up.
-Papa. Papa.

203
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.520
Come on. Come on.

204
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.320
Come on. Come on.

205
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.760
Up. Get up. Don't drag your feet.

206
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.520
-Papa.
-Shut your mouth. Shut up.

207
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.880
Papa.

208
00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.240
Our army will go to war in Allah's name.
and will be prepared for battle.

209
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.760
This may be the last time I see you.

210
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.400
-May you all be blessed.
-I give you my blessings.

211
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.240
-Blessings.
-Blessings.

212
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.560
May Allah bless us all.

213
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.840
Amen.

214
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.640
Amen.

215
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.880
If God almighty

216
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.240
makes a martyr of me.

217
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.840
the reign of sultan of the
Great Seljuk Empire shall go to…

218
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.800
our son Malik-Shah.

219
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.000
My father. My father is here.

220
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.080
My dear father.

221
00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.640
Welcome. dear father.

222
00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.520
-The boy has grown so much. God bless.
-Oh. has he grown.

223
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.600
He takes after his father. ready to fight.

224
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.000
War isn't the place for him.

225
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.560
If he stays behind.
he can take care of you and our land.

226
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.920
Also with war.

227
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.120
there's a possibility of not returning.

228
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.760
God forbid.

229
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.640
Well done. You tied a fine knot.

230
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.080
Dear father. with your permission.
I would like to accompany you.

231
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.240
Besides. mother says I'm now
of age for swordsmanship.

232
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.800
I'll tell you when you're ready. Not yet.

233
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.960
When will I be ready?

234
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.000
Battle is not our only call to duty. Son.

235
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.200
If we call this land our homeland.

236
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.840
it's not only because we conquered it.
but because we protect it from invaders.

237
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.720
This will be your duty as well.

238
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.800
Protecting the homeland when I'm gone.

239
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:13.280
I leave your mother and our village.
first to God. and then to you.

240
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.520
My queen.

241
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.080
in honor of your beautiful invitation.
I'd like to make a toast in your honor.

242
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.120
It's been two months
since my husband died.

243
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.080
I've expected a toast in his honor…

244
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.080
Commander Georgeus.

245
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.480
I've heard plenty of fancy words tonight.

246
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.680
-Natalia.
-My queen.

247
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.040
I want to go to my room.

248
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.120
Right away. Your Majesty.

249
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.440
These fools.

250
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.080
Our sultan is on his horse all day.
swinging his sword.

251
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.040
but here. the epitome of laziness.

252
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.960
Master. that may be. but you've saved
the sultan's life numerous times.

253
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.240
No. no. no.

254
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.440
Besides.

255
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:15.560
our sultan even trusts you to self-taste
the food you brought him. my master.

256
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.880
Well…

257
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.080
Well?

258
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.920
Well.

259
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.520
was it necessary for us to rush. master?

260
00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.320
The sultan won't be angered. anyway.

261
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.200
Can these ears not hear what you speak?

262
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.320
Do you want to destroy
the sultan's trust in me?

263
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.880
Master. look. forgive us.
We didn't mean it like that.

264
00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.800
He's got a point.

265
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.760
-The master's right.
-No. no. no. not from you.

266
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.320
You're both done here.

267
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.280
-Master.
-Master. please.

268
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.240
Let me kiss your hand. Master. look.

269
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.600
Please don't let us go. Please. master.

270
00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.040
You can only slip up once.

271
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.760
We own our mistakes. please.

272
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.040
For the love of God.

273
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.200
Please. look.

274
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.640
Yakup.

275
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.680
At your service.

276
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.880
Divide your men.

277
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.560
Guide them through the Georgian Kingdom
and into the Roman provinces.

278
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.240
Recruit Turkmen and Yuruk
tribesmen from the region

279
00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.280
and attack and besiege from everywhere.

280
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.800
Upon my return from Egypt.

281
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.240
their military forces should be decimated.

282
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.600
At your service. Sultan.

283
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.040
Send this urgently to Constantinople.
Deliver it to the empress.

284
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.120
At your command.

285
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.800
Why did you wait to send
the letter. my sultan?

286
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.200
We want Constantinople
to know of our existence. Vizier.

287
00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.440
My empress. the Turks have seized
and conquered almost everything.

288
00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.560
If we continue on this path.
we could lose all our lands in the east.

289
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.200
The soldiers have lost all confidence.

290
00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.840
Leadership is lacking.

291
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.720
Our own soldiers
are attacking our villages.

292
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.440
Their duty is to protect and serve.
yet they violate our property and honor.

293
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:45.200
People in every corner of our empire
are unhappy and unsafe.

294
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.080
They trust the Turks more
than their own troops.

295
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.800
Our women and children

296
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.480
are being taken from us
and sold into slavery.

297
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.840
Natalia!

298
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.040
My queen.

299
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.080
Immediately assemble the clergy
and commanders.

300
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.560
I have an important matter to discuss.

301
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.600
My dear knights.

302
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.920
commanders.

303
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.760
religious clergy.

304
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.080
and Patriarch Demetrios.
who is watching over God's empire…

305
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.200
I'm sure you're waiting in anticipation.
wondering what I have to say.

306
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.160
This is why I want to
begin my speech right away.

307
00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:40.800
As you know. due to
the untimely death of our late emperor.

308
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.720
our state fell into a great depression.

309
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:49.240
I've been receiving letters from
local governors and villages.

310
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:55.160
The Turks have besieged
most borders on the eastern front.

311
00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:02.520
Even worse. our soldiers have been
raiding our own villages.

312
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.120
And still. even though Commander Georgeus

313
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.360
didn't inform me of these matters.

314
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.360
I sense he is aware
of the content of these letters.

315
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.639
Empress--

316
00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:16.920
For this reason…

317
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.280
the army needs to be disciplined.

318
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.280
Our eastern borders have been
besieged by the Turks

319
00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.280
and in order to reclaim
our lost castles

320
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.520
we need a mighty emperor.

321
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.159
We need a successor to lead
our country and the military.

322
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.040
Why?

323
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.320
Well. Empress Eudokia.

324
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:54.320
who is the candidate for this succession?

325
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.280
Romanus Diogenes.

326
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.080
-It can't be. How is this so?
-How so?

327
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.360
Empress Eudokia.

328
00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.280
are you saying you're going to marry
a traitor who's awaiting his execution?

329
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.200
You heard right. Commander Georgeus.

330
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.600
Romanus Diogenes.

331
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.920
On the day our emperor died.
the funeral and church were raided

332
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
in a military coup against you.

333
00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.760
I was there too. Your All-Holiness.

334
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:32.440
In your opinion. was it not a display of
courage that warrants the throne?

335
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.640
With your permission.

336
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.400
-No way. How can this be?
-This is not possible.

337
00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.440
They will put him in charge.

338
00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.720
My queen. Patriarch Demetrios requests to
meet with you privately tomorrow morning.

339
00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.440
Sultan. I bring greetings from
Yakup Yabgu and Afþin.

340
00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.440
They've positioned their armies
deep within Byzantium.

341
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.360
Thank you. envoy. Thank you.

342
00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:01.200
Thankfully they represented us without
having to bow our heads before blasphemy.

343
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.920
God willing. we won't let them bow
their heads in this life or thereafter.

344
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.720
-Amen.
-Amen.

345
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.920
They should never stop.
They should continue.

346
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.480
Empress.

347
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:44.960
first off. I agree with your ideas and
propositions for our realm.

348
00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.920
And shall you choose to marry.
I will respect your decision.

349
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.200
However. in this case.
in the event of an emperor's death.

350
00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.920
you risk losing your crown.
should you choose to remarry.

351
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.080
I also want to remind you
that you've signed an oath.

352
00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.200
I remember my oath. Your All-Holiness.

353
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.240
But this marriage
is not of my personal will.

354
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.800
We'll establish a union
for the benefit of our realm.

355
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.080
Not with a treacherous traitor
who'll be hung in a few days.

356
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:31.120
You must marry someone approved
by the patriarchy. my empress.

357
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.280
For example?

358
00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.160
Torqius.

359
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.280
Not only because he's my brother.
but for his service to the empire.

360
00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.760
I think he deserves this position.

361
00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.000
Or Commander Georgeus.

362
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.720
He is the son of Armenian nobility

363
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.480
for at least 20 generations.

364
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.080
Moreover. he is a successful commander.

365
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.960
I encourage you to choose
between the two.

366
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.240
Otherwise.

367
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:35.120
I have to honor this oath.
even if I don't want to.

368
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:45.160
I could also have the execution
of Romanus Diogenes expedited.

369
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.920
I see. Your All-Holiness.

370
00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.360
In order for me to choose…

371
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.960
between your brother
and Commander Georgeus.

372
00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.400
I'll need a day to contemplate.
if you permit?

373
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.560
Gladly. my queen.

374
00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.360
Gladly.

375
00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.880
Believe it to be true.
This is most suitable for our empire.

376
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.280
-Give this to Valeria.
-At your service.

377
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.400
It's time.

378
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.080
The time to act has come.

379
00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.800
Get out.

380
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.840
You're wondering
why you're here. aren't you?

381
00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.200
Let me explain.

382
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.360
What you stated in trial was justified.

383
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.640
The Turks. with every passing day.

384
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.600
pose a greater and greater
threat to our empire.

385
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:27.360
What I want from you. is to yank the
Turks out by their roots in an act of war.

386
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.640
I'm on death row.
I'd like to remind you. my queen.

387
00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.960
I'd like to remind you…

388
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.800
…you are no longer.

389
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.160
I don't understand.

390
00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.160
Tomorrow you will marry me.

391
00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.440
But I want you to know…

392
00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.240
I have no need for a husband.

393
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.440
or any desire for a man.

394
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.920
I need an emperor

395
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.280
and a commander to lead my army.

396
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.520
Now go clean up.

397
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.560
because tomorrow morning
you will rise up an emperor.

398
00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.800
Because…

399
00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.560
of this marriage…

400
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.760
if I do get married.

401
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.640
I must relinquish my crown.

402
00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.680
according to this written oath
to the church.

403
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.160
It bears no meaning anymore.

404
00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.160
Come on!

405
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.280
Come on! Come on!

406
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.560
Hold on!

407
00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.040
-Ya Allah!
-Ya Allah!

408
00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.320
Commanders…

409
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.200
dear empress…

410
00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:11.360
in the name of God.

411
00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.480
and the powers that be.

412
00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.440
Romanus IV is himself

413
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.960
becoming

414
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.160
our new emperor.

415
00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.080
and I give my blessing.

416
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:53.080
How can a prisoner. previously sentenced
to death. become our emperor?

417
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.880
How can we allow it?

418
00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.640
Be quiet. Unless you
want to die. you must obey.

419
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
God bless our emperor.

420
00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:10.640
God bless the emperor!
God bless the emperor!

421
00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.680
Long live the emperor!
Long live the emperor!

422
00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.280
What's happening?

423
00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.160
You're all free now. Get out! Get out!

424
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.040
Why not escape like the others?

425
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.240
I have no place to go.

426
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.920
They killed my mother and father.

427
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.800
They burned down our village.

428
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.920
-We've avenged them. Isn't it enough?
-I haven't had enough.

429
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.400
I want to join you and fight those brutes.

430
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Skilled with a sword?

431
00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.760
I use a knife. I can learn to use a sword.

432
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.120
In the current state of affairs.

433
00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.640
we are well aware that we
have no time to waste.

434
00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.720
Before His All-Holiness.
God's holy representative.

435
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.560
and before our empress. especially…

436
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.520
I promise that until my last drop of blood

437
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.520
I will strive to be a worthy emperor.

438
00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.280
Long live the emperor!

439
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.360
We've seen a lot of pledges.

440
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.080
As soon as you gather the troops.
I want to head east.

441
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.080
This is why everyone should hurry.

442
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.800
Before we assign palace appointments.

443
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.560
make sure all loose ends are tied
so no mistakes are made. agreed?

444
00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.800
You can assign appointments on my
behalf as you wish. my empress.

445
00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:24.360
I feel secure on the battlefield and
find it safer than being in the palace.

446
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.240
May peace and blessings be upon you.

447
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.880
May peace and blessings be upon you.

448
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:58.760
God. bless me
with the honor of martyrdom.

449
00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.920
And give our army victory if you wish.

450
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.840
My emperor. the commander
of the Pecheneg Turks wants to see you.

451
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.400
-Bring him in.
-Yes. sir.

452
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:40.080
We want to join your war and
fight alongside you. dear emperor.

453
00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.880
Our presence will strengthen your army.

454
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
But sure…

455
00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.920
this comes at a price. yes?

456
00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:01.800
What do you want?

457
00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.320
A hundred thousand gold coins.

458
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.320
I also want a share of the loot.

459
00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.200
I have no business with the Seljuks.

460
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.360
You can pillage the Seljuk lands
for all the loot you desire.

461
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.280
Sir. I don't feel right
working with paid mercenaries.

462
00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.320
I really don't feel right
fighting alongside them.

463
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.880
If they even suspect loss in battle.

464
00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:41.160
they'll desert the battlefield
as easily as they came.

465
00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:52.080
Thank you for sharing your concerns.
Commander Georgeus. I am grateful.

466
00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:58.280
However. I request you do not
share these concerns with others.

467
00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.640
The army is to leave tomorrow morning.

468
00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.480
With longing and desire
they have prepared all week.

469
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.840
I assume all responsibility and risk.

470
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.000
I hope you will all comply
in the same way.

471
00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.880
What are you saying?

472
00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:21.560
I failed to find a worthier commander
to defend Constantinople than you.

473
00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.360
You are staying here.

474
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.600
Understood.

475
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.560
Antonius. prepare a strong defense unit
while we're away.

476
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.280
Don't create more work for us.

477
00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.400
Is it not safer to be
here by our side. sir?

478
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.400
After the trial. this man tried
everything in his power to kill me.

479
00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:51.000
and he'd do the same to become emperor.

480
00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:56.120
Special units are full of Armenian
soldiers and a commander academy too.

481
00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.720
Georgeus has had
a tremendous influence on them.

482
00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.480
Rather than come with us.
it's better to stay here.

483
00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.480
As you wish.

484
00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.560
Sultan Alp-Arslan.
I surrender our city to you.

485
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.760
Our people are here to serve you.

486
00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.360
Be blessed.

487
00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:14.960
Vizier.

488
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.560
know this.

489
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.960
No one will encroach upon
your liberty. property or worship.

490
00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.080
Everyone will continue living safely.

491
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.200
I declare the castle handed
over to you. sir.

492
00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:30.480
Our army's no longer an army of recruits.

493
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.680
Castles being conquered.
villages passing hand-to-hand.

494
00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.360
Haven't you witnessed how
they fight. Antonius?

495
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.720
I've freed my mind
from all those worries. sir.

496
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.720
So we will go above and beyond.

497
00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:46.560
We will come face-to-face with Alp-Arslan
and destroy him and his realm.

498
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.560
Gather your army.

499
00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.400
We are returning to Constantinople.

500
00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:58.520
We shall strengthen our forces
and return for a massive attack.

501
01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.200
My sultan.

502
01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.400
we have suffered casualties
during the siege of the Aleppo Citadel.

503
01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.520
Many soldiers lost.

504
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.240
I want to send a message
of peace to the castle.

505
01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:59.840
I am the ruler of the Great Seljuk Empire.
Sultan Alp-Arslan.

506
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:07.440
Exactly when did I admit defeat?
Now you make this request. huh?

507
01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.720
Either you lead the army yourself

508
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.280
or I relieve you of your duty.

509
01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.400
At your service. my sultan.

510
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.400
Dear Sultan.
the Greek ambassador wants to see you.

511
01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.320
Let him in.

512
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.920
I've brought you this letter from
Emperor Romanus Diogenes.

513
01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.360
How long was your journey?

514
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.480
I traveled 20 days.

515
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.240
Send his scalp back to Diogenes.

516
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.640
Master. stop.

517
01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.320
-Master. stop.
-Thank you. Lord.

518
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.160
Let me go. Stop. I'm fine.

519
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.120
Let go.

520
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.200
The Greek ambassador came today.

521
01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.520
I'm in my usual place. as you know.
the sultan's right-hand man.

522
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.720
He crossed the line.

523
01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.120
Then a soldier appears.

524
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.640
I grabbed the sword and snap!

525
01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.480
I cut off his head and served it to him.

526
01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.920
Really?

527
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.800
What did our sultan do. master?

528
01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.000
What could he do?

529
01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.960
He grabbed me by the neck.
pulled me close.

530
01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.120
and kissed my forehead.

531
01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.520
He said. "Well done. Aþbörü."
Look. he kissed me right here.

532
01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.840
He doesn't kiss anyone else.
He won't kiss anyone else.

533
01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.280
Back to work. Come on. Go.

534
01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920
Master.

535
01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:43.280
He wanted me to sign an oath.
to return the castles back to him.

536
01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.720
The fact that the ambassador embarked
on a 20-day journey to get here

537
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:56.280
tells me they will likely hit the road
with an even bigger army.

538
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
His intentions are obviously to not only
retrieve castles and land…

539
01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.640
but to destroy us completely.

540
01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.320
Their assassination attempt
fuels the anger that's buried within.

541
01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.120
We must withdraw from the siege. Vizier.

542
01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.960
We will need to cross Byzantine forces
on our way to Isfahan.

543
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.440
Do you think you stand a chance against
that huge army and all those soldiers?

544
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:49.400
With Yakup Yabgu and Afþin.
we shall unite in the Greek provinces.

545
01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.160
My sultan. 150.000 people are coming.

546
01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.680
Even if we combined all the Turks.
we still wouldn't have that many.

547
01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.160
This is how victories are won. Vizier.

548
01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.720
This is how
great wars are lost. my sultan.

549
01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.760
You still don't get it. do you. Vizier?

550
01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.640
This war is our destiny.

551
01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.320
We are not here to flee.

552
01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.160
This land will be our homeland
and will belong to us forever.

553
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:43.040
What if something happens to you. Sultan?

554
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.840
Don't worry. Vizier.

555
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.680
Our state will not be without a leader.

556
01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.320
Now get ready.

557
01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.360
You will go to Isfahan.

558
01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:04.960
If I am made a martyr. you must
prepare my son Malik-Shah for the throne.

559
01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.720
At your service. my sultan.

560
01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.360
Welcome. great emperor.

561
01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.640
Welcome!

562
01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:32.080
-Our glorious emperor!
-Long live the emperor!

563
01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.480
Welcome. Emperor Diogenes!

564
01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.360
Long live Emperor Diogenes.

565
01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.560
Long live Emperor Diogenes.

566
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.000
-Our emperor.
-Welcome.

567
01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.040
Long live the emperor.

568
01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.640
Long live Emperor Diogenes.

569
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.120
Welcome.

570
01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.760
Thank you for not embarrassing me.

571
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.399
sublime emperor.

572
01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:18.880
I reckon that Alp-Arslan has
received my message.

573
01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:21.439
Soon I'll surpass his rule by far.

574
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.800
and we will free ourselves from
his rule forever.

575
01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.960
I'm wondering…

576
01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.439
would you like to spend the night here?

577
01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.560
You now trust Commander Georgeus. I guess?

578
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.840
No. but I have to take him with me.

579
01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.240
Because…

580
01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.479
if Georgeus stays here.

581
01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:18.720
I would need to leave my best commander
to keep him in check.

582
01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:22.960
I need my commanders. Not Georgeus.

583
01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:32.840
Will you return victorious?

584
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.240
Definitely. my queen.

585
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.640
Sultan Alp-Arslan sends his regards.

586
01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.120
I'll destroy any obstacle in my path
without a second thought.

587
01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.880
Even if they are Christian?

588
01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.720
Yes. Even a Christian.

589
01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.720
Turkish. Greek. Armenian. Christian. Arab.
there is no such thing as a Muslim.

590
01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.240
There's the Eastern Roman Empire
or Byzantium.

591
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.440
Joining us in battle
are the sacrilegious Turks

592
01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.400
who took refuge with Alp-Arslan.

593
01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.520
It's been said he even helped Christians.

594
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.320
His messengers come to me every day.

595
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.800
But the Turks in our army are ruthless.

596
01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.680
What difference does it make.
Commander Georgeus?

597
01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.480
The spoils of war have no religion.

598
01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.080
Sacrilegious Turks long for the spoils
of war far more than my soldiers.

599
01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.160
Our people will share
pride and victory at the end of this war.

600
01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.400
Those who do not will perish.

601
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.760
As you know. for three months we've been
recruiting and preparing for this war.

602
01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.120
I appeal to you before God.

603
01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.600
Tomorrow we'll confront the infidel Turks.

604
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.600
As we journey out. do not forget the
religious burdens we've carried.

605
01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:14.480
As your emperor. I must warn
you of the news I've heard.

606
01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.480
From what my messengers have told me.

607
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.640
some of our brethren in faith are
conspiring with the infidel Turks

608
01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.480
and they harbor hostility towards us.

609
01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.680
I stand before you all. in God's grace.

610
01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.120
With His All-Holiness the Patriarch
as my witness. I declare.

611
01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.560
those who betray you. those who battle you

612
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.080
will get killed regardless of
their religion or race.

613
01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.000
Even if they bear a cross.
you shall not hesitate to kill them.

614
01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.120
They are either with us or against us.

615
01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.360
We are the true believers.

616
01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.840
May God protect you all!

617
01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.040
Long live Diogenes.

618
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.040
Within a few days.
we will arrive in this region.

619
01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.240
We must reclaim the villages
that were conquered by the Seljuks.

620
01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.800
We'll fight with great force.

621
01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.080
The faster we move.
the more land we reconquer.

622
01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.480
Sir. we have been on the road for 30 days.

623
01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:04.400
If the soldiers are overworked.
the results could be fatal.

624
01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:13.120
A soldier's honor is to fight tirelessly.
even die for their cause. Commander.

625
01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.800
If not. they should be farmers.

626
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.240
Sir. there is news regarding Alp-Arslan.

627
01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.280
He is struggling to gather an army.

628
01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.520
By the time we arrive. they should have
at least 20-30.000 troops.

629
01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.080
Nice.

630
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.120
This opens up opportunities. of course.

631
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:32.720
How so?

632
01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.360
Allow me to show you in due time.

633
01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.280
The emperor called for me.

634
01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.960
Two cats

635
01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.840
in one sack.

636
01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.560
Not a good fit.

637
01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.160
On the road we'll pass villages
where we massacred Armenian commanders.

638
01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.120
We will be met with resistance.

639
01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:30.160
For this reason. we must eradicate
all Armenian villages from history.

640
01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.360
Let there be no enemies left standing.

641
01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.640
Yes. sir.

642
01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.240
Praise Allah.

643
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.960
Praise Allah.

644
01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.400
Blessings of Allah be upon you all.

645
01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.640
Blessings of Allah be upon you all.

646
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.600
Oh. Lord. we place our trust in you.

647
01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:19.480
With perseverance I bow to you
and I fight for you.

648
01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.200
Oh. Lord. we placed our trust in you.

649
01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.520
We dedicate our servitude to you

650
01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.960
in all your power and might.

651
01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.160
Oh. Lord. we place our trust you.

652
01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.960
May we exalt in the name of Islam.

653
01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.480
Condemn my enemies.

654
01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.520
Grant us victory. my Lord.

655
01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.160
Amen.

656
01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.440
SIVAS REGION
AN ARMENIAN VILLAGE

657
01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.000
The emperor has gone mad.

658
01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.000
At this rate.
no Armenians will be left standing.

659
01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:49.760
-God protect us all.
-Amen.

660
01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.560
My sultan. there's a message
from Daniþment.

661
01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.440
Let him in.

662
01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.080
My sultan.

663
01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.960
Yes. Ambassador.

664
01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.400
The noble Daniþment sent me.

665
01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.720
Ten Turkish tribes have joined
their forces and await to meet you.

666
01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.600
He will join the army on the way.
There are Turkmen as well.

667
01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:39.320
The Kurdish dynasty
of Marwanids has also joined them.

668
01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:45.360
Thank you. Ambassador. Let them join.

669
01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.120
We are looking for
the Seljuk Sultan Alp-Arslan.

670
01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.280
Why do you seek him?

671
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.440
Are your intentions hostile?

672
01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.680
My name is Kurtbey.

673
01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.760
My brothers also swore
to drink Byzantine blood.

674
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.720
We heard he had set out for war.

675
01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:49.080
We are under his command
and we will fight to the death.

676
01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.840
Why should Alp-Arslan trust you?

677
01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:59.600
My father was the most loyal warrior
amongst his ancestors.

678
01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.720
He was sent off to Anatolia.

679
01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.200
They did not surrender to the Byzantines.
They managed to escape.

680
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.760
For years we have been waiting
to exact our revenge.

681
01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.920
The day of Byzantine bloodshed has come.

682
01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.720
If you don't know of Alp-Arslan.
do not stand on our way.

683
01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.120
Sultan?

684
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.160
By my command. we shall toast
to the mercy of martyrdom.

685
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.720
Blessings. brave one.

686
01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:56.760
Blessings.

687
01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:20.440
My sultan. we are here to fight
and we are prepared to die.

688
01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.000
Welcome. brave ones.

689
01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.600
May Allah bless us all.

690
01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:34.600
Praise Allah! Praise Allah! Praise Allah!

691
01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:54.440
A bit higher. From above.
Like this. Now pull. Pull.

692
01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:56.600
Just like that. Go on.

693
01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.640
Do not bend your elbow. Continue.

694
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.040
Go ahead. my brave-hearted one.

695
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.440
Yes. courageous one.

696
01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:15.720
The Greeks will be weighed down
by their armor.

697
01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:22.240
They won't stand a chance
against our cavalry.

698
01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.520
Prepare with this in mind.

699
01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:30.080
We will test this theory once in battle.

700
01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.000
Be prepared for tonight as well.

701
01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.600
Let us observe our enemies

702
01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.080
and see how they react to an ambush.

703
01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.320
Come. fearless ones.

704
01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.880
Help me!

705
01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:06.040
Allah. Allah. Allah. Allah!

706
01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.440
Let the heads roll!

707
01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:37.120
It's hard to admit. but the Turkish
invasion has demoralized our soldiers.

708
01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.560
How many lost?

709
01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:40.840
Around 100.

710
01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:44.440
Not such a big deal for us.

711
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.440
Then why the low morale?

712
01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:54.040
Sir. before the attack
the army faced a sudden ambush

713
01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.960
and many lives were lost.

714
01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.080
Inevitably. morale was lost.

715
01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:04.520
As you know. many mercenaries
and relatives are from the same village.

716
01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:13.320
Because of this. we shall capture
and execute 100 Turks in their place.

717
01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:17.720
We will capture and execute 100 Turks.

718
01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.200
As a morale booster.

719
01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:03.400
May one captive Turk be sacrificed
for each friend you've lost.

720
01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.880
Your pain is my pain.
Your revenge is my revenge.

721
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.200
We will wipe Turks
from the face of the earth!

722
01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:30.440
Sir. may the wrath
of Emperor Diogenes escape us.

723
01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.880
What do you know. soldier?

724
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.000
Mind your business. Let's go.

725
01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:43.800
The Byzantines will also have
the Pechenegs by their side.

726
01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.160
I do not find Turks fighting
Turks appropriate.

727
01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.560
I know. Suleiman. I know.

728
01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:56.600
Sultan. I find it more appropriate
to attack from the left flank.

729
01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.600
We will find a solution. Suleiman.

730
01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:02.840
There is no better day than
tomorrow to mobilize our army.

731
01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.160
The blood that flows
never stalls in the vein.

732
01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:09.920
According to my calculations…

733
01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:17.640
with Allah's grace. we will
establish our camp around Malazgirt.

734
01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.520
We bring good news. my sultan.

735
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:29.920
Tell us. Yakup.

736
01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:36.960
Byzantine troops
were decimated by our attacks.

737
01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:39.720
God bless.

738
01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:44.560
And we brought you loot. my sultan.

739
01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:16.440
Let this cross be delivered
to the caliph as soon as possible.

740
01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:20.000
Let them know the sanctity of our cause.

741
01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.440
May they not withhold their prayers.

742
01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:28.200
Victory belongs to those
who believe in Almighty Allah!

743
01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:33.000
Praise Allah! Praise Allah! Praise Allah!

744
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.840
You are strong.

745
01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:24.040
Now with the sword.

746
01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.280
Not bad.

747
01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.560
If you like. we can keep working.

748
01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.000
Right. Waist.

749
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.240
Very good. Once more.

750
01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:12.080
We are Alp-Arslan's soldiers of Baþbuð

751
01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:16.800
We are the sword of God on earth

752
01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:21.880
We didn't turn this way
We won't look back

753
01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:26.680
We swore. with heaven and earth
As our witness

754
01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:31.440
Oh. God. God Almighty

755
01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:35.720
Oh. God. God Almighty

756
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:36.840
Let's go.

757
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.840
On this road
The Gray Wolves will not tire

758
01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:54.720
Coyotes will not be allowed

759
01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.720
-Master.
-Come on. Say it.

760
01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.760
Will we fight tomorrow too?

761
01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.960
What are you asking. fool?
If necessary. we will fight.

762
01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.440
But if you two cowards are afraid.
you can cower behind me.

763
01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:09.560
Your master will defend you both.

764
01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:14.920
Do you think cooking is my only skill?

765
01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:18.960
And what are these skills?

766
01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.000
To protect the sultan.

767
01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.120
How so?

768
01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:29.960
We are in battle again like old times.

769
01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:31.840
I'm on this side.

770
01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:35.560
My sultan is on that side too.
I keep an eye on him.

771
01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:39.120
They surrounded him. I saw it.

772
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.240
I jumped on my horse
and galloped towards them.

773
01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:43.760
-Galloped?
-Yes.

774
01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:47.480
I dove between them and
drew my sword. Whoosh!

775
01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.240
I chopped off his head. Whoosh.
Then his arm.

776
01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.960
And then I cut off his leg.

777
01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:56.840
Yeah.

778
01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.000
Blood everywhere.

779
01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:05.760
What war was it. Aþbörü?

780
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
My sultan.

781
01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.680
Forgive me. my sultan!

782
01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:20.000
I was led astray.

783
01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.000
It hurts so much.

784
01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:25.040
My sultan. you misunderstood me.
Please forgive me.

785
01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.440
Hey. slow down.

786
01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.800
My sultan. please forgive me.

787
01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.600
-You must be strong.
-Is that so?

788
01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:44.720
Son!

789
01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.560
What are you doing here?

790
01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.320
Dad.

791
01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.280
What business do you have here. Son?

792
01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:52.840
Did I not confide all my trust in you?

793
01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:57.840
Dad. Turkmen go from village to village.
Sultan Alp-Arslan needs soldiers.

794
01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:00.960
If not. the state will lose control.

795
01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:04.920
I've come to fight for Sultan Alp-Arslan.
and to defend my state and religion.

796
01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.080
Did I make a mistake?

797
01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:11.160
You made a mistake by not listening. Son.

798
01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.200
But it doesn't matter anymore.

799
01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.800
May God bless you too. Son.

800
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.600
Be careful. okay?

801
01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:36.640
Come on.

802
01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.680
Come over and help.

803
01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.840
Come on. Hurry up.

804
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.760
Quick.

805
01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:48.800
-Did you find a saddle?
-Come on.

806
01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.280
Come. come. Go on.

807
01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.680
Why do Turks tie the horses' tails?

808
01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.000
Don't swing. Don't swing.

809
01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.280
Did you get supplies?

810
01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:08.640
Horses are our best friends
on the battlefield.

811
01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.640
The moment we tie their tail
both the rider and the horse

812
01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:18.000
know that they could be
riding to their death.

813
01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:47.200
MALAZGIRT PLAIN

814
01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:55.920
My heroes. my brothers.
there is only one sultan here.

815
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Almighty Allah.

816
01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:01.440
Divine order and destiny are in his hands.

817
01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:05.680
No matter how many forces they have.

818
01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:09.240
and regardless of how few we are.

819
01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:14.320
may this white robe be my shroud.

820
01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:20.160
Until the last drop of blood that flows
through my veins. I shall fight for Allah.

821
01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.080
Soldiers. commanders. always remember

822
01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:29.160
we're protected by the benevolence of God
in our fight against the infidels.

823
01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:37.160
We fight for Jesus Christ. our Lord.
who sacrificed himself for us.

824
01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.360
Do not fear death!

825
01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.440
If we reach our goal.

826
01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:47.040
we will claim victory on our homeland.

827
01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:52.000
Otherwise. we will go to heaven
to live alongside the prophet.

828
01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:57.720
You can either join me in jihad

829
01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:02.600
or you can go your own way
and are free to go wherever you wish.

830
01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:10.200
There's room for us all in God's kingdom.

831
01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:16.880
The fate of all Christianity
is on your shoulders!

832
01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:19.880
This day is the day of war.

833
01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.320
The day is the day of victory.

834
01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:25.280
Today is the day of martyrdom.

835
01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:28.920
The campaign is ours.
The victory belongs to Allah!

836
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.360
Praise Allah! Praise Allah!

837
01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.920
DAY 1

838
01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:27.320
Antonius. tell all the troops

839
01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.040
we will wait for the Turks
to make the first move.

840
01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.760
At your service. sir.

841
01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.440
No one should leave their post
without our command.

842
01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:22.160
DAY 2

843
01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:45.680
What do you think. my sultan?

844
01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:49.960
FRIDAY. AUGUST 26. 1071

845
01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:55.760
I'm wondering where I will bury
all the Greeks. Suleiman.

846
01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:08.880
Suleiman.

847
01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:14.800
once they pull back.
we will go in for attack.

848
01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:20.080
After battling for a while.
I want them to retreat with haste.

849
01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:22.760
At your service. my sultan.

850
01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.400
Let's withdraw the army.

851
01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.280
Looks like they won't attack today.

852
01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.160
Horsemen!

853
01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:23.800
They're attacking.

854
01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:34.360
With 30 horses?

855
01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.080
What are they trying to do?

856
01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.680
They're escaping. They're escaping.

857
01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.320
-They're running.
-They're running.

858
01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:23.880
Archers!

859
01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:50.720
Take cover. Be careful.

860
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:58.080
Tell the Pechenegs to handle the archers.

861
01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:00.720
May our battles be blessed. brave ones.

862
01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:04.280
In the name of Allah!

863
01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:21.720
Oh. Allah!

864
01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:25.960
THE NIGHT BEFORE
PECHENEG TRIBE

865
01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:53.080
Who are you?

866
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:03.600
I'm an official of the Great Seljuk State.

867
01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:06.120
Sultan Alp-Arslan.

868
01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:11.320
I'm not going to kill you.

869
01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:14.840
We are of the same blood.

870
01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:19.120
I do not shed Turkish blood.

871
01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:21.560
Sure…

872
01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:33.280
but if our nation or our state

873
01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.800
are betrayed…

874
01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.800
know that I will be your death wish.

875
01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:45.480
You can fight tomorrow with this in mind.

876
01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:27.040
We've been betrayed.

877
01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:48.560
My brave son.

878
01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:50.000
-My brave son.
-Father!

879
01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.360
Son.

880
01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:59.640
My son. my flesh. my blood.

881
01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:03.200
Father. am I a martyr?

882
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.280
You are a martyr. my son.

883
01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:14.040
You are in heaven. Son.

884
01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:17.520
I am a martyr.

885
01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.720
You are martyred!

886
01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:16.400
Now it's time for Turks to seek justice.

887
01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:55.760
Praise Allah! Praise Allah!

888
01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:19.520
Untie his hands.

889
01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:37.200
You fought quite well. Commander.

890
01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:39.640
I congratulate you.

891
01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:43.760
You are a mighty emperor.

892
01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:48.440
Your belongings will be returned to you.

893
01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:51.040
Your reputation will be left intact.

894
01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:55.680
When war reparations are sent…

895
01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:01.600
you will be sent back to
your capital safe and sound.

896
02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:06.240
Why are you treating me so kindly?

897
02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:14.120
If you were in my place.
what would you do?

898
02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:17.400
Tie you to my horse.

899
02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:20.040
put you in a cage.

900
02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:24.440
and show you off as prisoner of war
all across Byzantium.

901
02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:51.520
That's the difference between us.

902
02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:58.760
My heroes. my brothers…

903
02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:07.240
your blood was spilled in these lands.
and your souls nourished this soil.

904
02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:10.320
With the entire world as my witness.

905
02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:16.800
tomorrow the sun will rise on this land
and cast its light on the Turkish banner.

906
02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:21.160
I have brought you a homeland

907
02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:25.000
that will be yours forever.

908
02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:34.240
AFTER THE MALAZGIRT VICTORY
ON AUGUST 26

909
02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.760
THE GATES OF ANATOLIA
OPENED TO TURKS

910
02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:40.200
AND SULTAN ALP-ARSLAN
WENT DOWN IN HISTORY

911
02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:43.880
AS THE CONQUEROR OF ANATOLIA.

912
02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:47.280
ON THAT DAY ANATOLIA BECAME
THE HOMELAND FOR THE TURKS.

913
02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:50.080
AS WELL AS THE CENTER
OF THE GREAT TURKIC EMPIRE.

914
02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:08.520
We are Alp-Arslan's soldiers of Baþbuð

915
02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:12.680
We are the sword of God on earth

916
02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:16.680
We didn't turn this way
We won't look back

917
02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:20.800
We swore. with heaven and earth
As our witness

918
02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:24.880
Oh. God. God Almighty

919
02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:28.920
Oh. God. God Almighty

920
02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.440
On this road
The Gray Wolves will not tire

921
02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:49.480
Coyotes will not be allowed

922
02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:53.040
The sky will not collapse
And the earth will not be shattered

923
02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:57.720
The rule of the world
Belongs to the Turks

924
02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:01.840
Oh. God. God Almighty

925
02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:05.440
Oh. God. God Almighty

926
02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:18.320
Ozan Erhan sings
Gray Wolves play the instruments

927
02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:21.760
You are the future of the nation
Gray Wolves

928
02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:26.000
Martyrs. veterans
We are Gray Wolves

929
02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:30.560
Hearts beat on for Kýzýlelma

930

Oh. God. God Almighty

931
02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:38.320
Oh. God. God Almighty

932
02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:50.960
Our ancestor Metehan.

933
02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:54.920
Our ancestor Metehan
Our homeland Turan

934
02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:58.360
We stand before Malazgirt. Alp-Arslan

935
02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:02.840
The moment we stamp
Our Turkish seal on the world

936
02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:06.520
Let the angels descend
In the name of Allah

937
02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:10.240
Oh. God. God Almighty

938
02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:21.480
Seven climates

939
02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:25.640
Seven climates. eight sky witnesses

940
02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:32.480
Crescent in the sky
Tons of witnesses on the ground

941
02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:37.400
Witness us today. witness us yesterday

942
02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:40.680
Flowers bloomed on God's mountains

943
02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:43.720
Oh. God. God Almighty
