What's new?

90
00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:42.969
- I ran into David Garrison
on my way to lunch.

91
00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.302
and he had quite a bit of info to offer.

92
00:04:50.702 --> 00:04:53.652
- Excuse me sir. you dropped something.

93
00:04:53.652 --> 00:04:54.612
- Sabrina?

94
00:04:54.612 --> 00:04:55.445
- David?

95
00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:57.091
Haven't seen you in a while.

96
00:04:57.091 --> 00:04:58.827
How has everything been going?

97
00:04:58.827 --> 00:05:01.149
- A nightmare. a total fucking nightmare.

98
00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:02.597
- Why do you say that?

99
00:05:02.597 --> 00:05:04.692
- For starters. me living on a daily basis

100
00:05:04.692 --> 00:05:07.357
not knowing what the FBI
gonna do about my indictment

101
00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:08.390
on top of me knowing the truth

102
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.094
about the Jasmine King situation.

103
00:05:10.094 --> 00:05:12.143
- What do you mean the truth?

104
00:05:12.143 --> 00:05:14.125
(sighs heavily)
- Sabrina. if I tell you this

105
00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:15.994
this got to stay just between you and I.

106
00:05:15.994 --> 00:05:17.345
- David. you have my word.

107
00:05:17.345 --> 00:05:19.257
- I know everything that took place

108
00:05:19.257 --> 00:05:21.739
leading up until and during the murder.

109
00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:24.065
I also know that Ricky played a huge part

110
00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:26.361
in a lot of unsolved homicides.

111
00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:29.125
but by me being up under indictment.

112
00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:31.097
my testimony is not credible.

113
00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:33.255
- David. we will do everything we can

114
00:05:33.255 --> 00:05:34.894
to support you in this case.

115
00:05:34.894 --> 00:05:38.560
- Look it's good to
see you but I gotta go.

116
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.307
- I will do all I can to
help him get through this.

117
00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.750
but first. I need him to agree to testify

118
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.206
in regards to the Jasmine case.

119
00:05:46.206 --> 00:05:50.539
and then we can discuss his
case. over a few drinks.

120

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:00.835
- For me?

124
00:06:00.835 --> 00:06:02.005
I didn't order anything.

125
00:06:02.005 --> 00:06:03.188

126
00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:06.233

00:08:17.118 --> 00:08:19.201
Let me get that head gear

183
00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:33.678
- Chad.

184
00:08:34.528 --> 00:08:35.361
Hey Chad

185
00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:37.549
- [Chad] Yes sir

186
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:42.648
- Let me holla at you for a minute.

187
00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:49.263
I need you to run a
couple of errands for me.

188
00:08:57.098 --> 00:08:58.897
There's two packages in here.

189
00:08:58.897 --> 00:09:01.229
I need you to take one to Mr B's

190
00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:03.565
and the other one to the tenant trap.

191
00:09:03.565 --> 00:09:05.209
- What about this cash?

192
00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:06.767
- That's for your pocket?

193
00:09:06.767 --> 00:09:07.767
- All right.

194
00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:12.925
(upbeat music)

195
00:09:37.458 --> 00:09:40.382
- I found his shoe box in
your mother fucking room.

196
00:09:40.382 --> 00:09:42.011
- Mom why were you in my room?

197
00:09:42.011 --> 00:09:43.808
- What the fuck do you mean
why me I'm in your room?

198
00:09:43.808 --> 00:09:47.213
Where the fuck you get this
mother fucking money from?

199
00:09:47.213 --> 00:09:49.832
- From Mr. Z. he paid me
to run errands for him

200
00:09:49.832 --> 00:09:50.768
- Oh hell no!

201
00:09:50.768 --> 00:09:51.602
You got me fucked up

202
00:09:51.602 --> 00:09:53.708
that's the biggest drug dealer in Cleve

203
00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:54.797
You got to pack your shit

204
00:09:54.797 --> 00:09:56.879
and go live with your motherfucker father.

205
00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:59.002
'Cause you weren't even
about to go down that path.

206
00:09:59.002 --> 00:10:01.078
But my motherfucking ass

207
00:10:01.078 --> 00:10:02.733

208
00:10:02.733 --> 00:10:04.943
and get the fuck up out of here.

209
00:10:04.943 --> 00:10:06.831
'Cause this ain't day.

210
00:10:06.831 --> 00:10:09.487
Nah. you can leave this right here.

211
00:10:09.487 --> 00:10:11.577
Go get your shit.

212
00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:12.410
- Florida I win.

213
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.410
- Y'all hear me. your clothes count.

214
00:10:16.412 --> 00:10:18.590
- Get out your mind go finish your story.

215
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.776
(mumbles)

216
00:10:19.776 --> 00:10:20.609
- Alright. for sure man.

217
00:10:20.609 --> 00:10:21.442
- Yeah

218
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.274
- Reprose Koko is a grocery store today.

219
00:10:25.274 --> 00:10:27.775
She'll be ready to sing any minute now.

220
00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:28.649
- What make you believe that

221
00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:31.717
- Because chloric he'd been
applying maximum pressure to it.

222
00:10:31.717 --> 00:10:34.301
- Well you got to do something
until we win our appeal.

223
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:35.508
You notice when the flag is home.

224
00:10:35.508 --> 00:10:37.525
The better our finances will be.

225
00:10:37.525 --> 00:10:40.938
- Look I know I haven't been
keeping my ad due to my divorce

226
00:10:40.938 --> 00:10:43.381
But we don't need his money.

227
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:46.134
- I'm not about to have
this conversation right now.

228
00:10:46.134 --> 00:10:49.033
Just keep your eye on a sneaky bitch.

229
00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:51.700
- Okay I got you. I can do that.

230
00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:04.233
- [Man on phone] Hey ma' what's going on.

231
00:11:04.233 --> 00:11:05.590
talked to Pablo today.

232
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:06.708
- Oh really.

233
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:07.541
- [Man on phone] He's just telling me

234
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:09.152
how you used to be chasing him at the gym

235
00:11:09.152 --> 00:11:11.185
when he was a teenager.

236
00:11:11.185 --> 00:11:12.561
- That man is a damn lie.

237
00:11:12.561 --> 00:11:14.486
He's been chasing me his whole life.

238
00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:16.269
- [Man on phone] Tell me something.

239
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:17.627
how did y'all even get together

240
00:11:17.627 --> 00:11:20.180
if his mother sent him off to Florida?

241
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.513
- Well. after he disappeared

242
00:11:23.564 --> 00:11:26.362
I graduated high school
and went off to college.

243
00:11:26.362 --> 00:11:29.163
- [Man on Phone] Is
that's where you met Pat?

244
00:11:29.163 --> 00:11:30.979
- Yeah that's where I met Pat.

245
00:11:30.979 --> 00:11:33.097
you know that was my
first time away from home.

246
00:11:33.097 --> 00:11:34.499
so I acted a damn fool.

247
00:11:34.499 --> 00:11:36.329
- Hey. how are you?

248
00:11:36.329 --> 00:11:38.557
I'm Patricia and you are?

249
00:11:38.557 --> 00:11:41.470
- Hey Patricia. I'm Anita.

250
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.350
- Nice to meet you. welcome.

251
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.942
I'll be your new chaperone. and dorm mate.

252
00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:48.219
Come on I'll come show you around.

253
00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:50.677
- Man we became the best of friends.

254
00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:55.194
If you saw her then you
saw me and vice versa.

255
00:11:55.194 --> 00:11:57.171
And then we started
partying every single night

256
00:11:57.171 --> 00:12:00.054
- My first night it was jumping

257
00:12:00.054 --> 00:12:01.962
- I'm surprised. I'm
not coming over and...

258
00:12:01.962 --> 00:12:04.438
- I can't wait to the next one

259
00:12:04.438 --> 00:12:08.479
- Oh my. girl don't look.
don't look. don't look.

260
00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:10.172
(mumbles)

261
00:12:10.172 --> 00:12:12.693
- Hey let me talk to you for a second.

262
00:12:12.693 --> 00:12:13.526
- Go ahead

263
00:12:13.526 --> 00:12:15.638
(mumbles)

264
00:12:15.638 --> 00:12:18.713
Yes do it. you've been waiting

265
00:12:18.713 --> 00:12:20.880
(mumbles)

266
00:12:24.734 --> 00:12:26.067
- Hey. I'm Eric.

267
00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:30.550
You gotta be afraid I don't bite.

268
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.972
- Hi Eric. I'm Pat. this is my girl Anita.

269
00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:34.861
- Oh nice to meet you Kat.

270
00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:37.802
Anita has anybody ever told
you how beautiful you are.

271
00:12:37.802 --> 00:12:40.135
- Excuse me the name is Pat.

272
00:12:41.207 --> 00:12:42.945
She gets told that every day.

273
00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:43.778
(chuckles)

274
00:12:43.778 --> 00:12:46.797
My apologies Pat. I
don't mean to offend you.

275
00:12:46.797 --> 00:12:48.248
Yeah let me start over.

276
00:12:48.248 --> 00:12:51.973
Hello Pat. and Anita would
y'all do me the honor.

277
00:12:51.973 --> 00:12:55.519
of being my guest at one of
the campus parties tonight.

278
00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:56.936
- Sure. we'll go.

279
00:12:58.633 --> 00:12:59.759
- Go down.

280
00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:00.623
- Sounds good.

281
00:13:00.623 --> 00:13:01.456
- Yeah

282
00:13:01.456 --> 00:13:03.117
(laughs)

283
00:13:03.117 --> 00:13:06.343
- And this one night. we
party with a group of guys

284
00:13:06.343 --> 00:13:07.659
and I promise you son that was

285
00:13:07.659 --> 00:13:10.988
the worst decision I ever made.

286
00:13:10.988 --> 00:13:12.906
(door knock)

287
00:13:12.906 --> 00:13:16.156
- [Man] Hey look. somebody at the door.

288
00:13:19.727 --> 00:13:22.527
- Hey Pat and Nit. how you doing?

289
00:13:22.527 --> 00:13:23.868
- Hey.

290
00:13:23.868 --> 00:13:26.669
(squeaking)

291
00:13:26.669 --> 00:13:29.146
I heard Eric was here.

292
00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:30.405
- I don't know about that

293
00:13:30.405 --> 00:13:33.286
but you guys take a seat.

294
00:13:33.286 --> 00:13:34.635
You guys want a drink?

295
00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:35.669
- No thank you.

296
00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:38.336
- Anita I don't know about this.

297
00:13:39.226 --> 00:13:43.226
I mean. it'd be fine he
said he'll be here soon.

298
00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:45.962
Well um...

299
00:13:47.181 --> 00:13:51.937
- Girl no I don't want
wine I think we need to go.

300
00:13:51.937 --> 00:13:54.682
- I'ma stay. but look stay by the phone

301
00:13:54.682 --> 00:13:56.691
I'll call you if I need you.

302
00:13:56.691 --> 00:13:58.879
- Girl are you sure?

303
00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:01.632
- Yeah he said he'll be here

304
00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:04.819
it'll be fine. it'll be fine.

305
00:14:04.819 --> 00:14:06.152
- Alright Anita.

306
00:14:08.626 --> 00:14:10.939
Anita just call me if you need me.

307
00:14:10.939 --> 00:14:13.503
- Yeah. it'll be fine.

308
00:14:13.503 --> 00:14:14.336
- Okay.

309
00:14:18.427 --> 00:14:21.099
(oven dings)

310
00:14:21.099 --> 00:14:22.549
(chuckles)

311
00:14:22.549 --> 00:14:25.536
(sizzling)

312
00:14:25.536 --> 00:14:26.931
- [Man on phone] Why do you say that?

313
00:14:26.931 --> 00:14:28.364
- Because I started doing drugs

314
00:14:28.364 --> 00:14:31.095
and I ain't talking about weed.

315
00:14:31.095 --> 00:14:32.817
- He said he'll be out here in a minute.

316
00:14:32.817 --> 00:14:34.360
You should go ahead and party soon.

317
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.635
- I don't even know what that is

318
00:14:35.635 --> 00:14:37.107
I never did that before.

319
00:14:37.107 --> 00:14:38.913
- Oh. I was just starting to
some of this blow right here

320
00:14:38.913 --> 00:14:41.663
it'll calm you down a little bit.

321
00:14:59.216 --> 00:15:02.799
- That next morning. I
did remember nothing.

322
00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:05.879
I hurried up and got dressed
and went back to my dorm.

323
00:15:05.879 --> 00:15:09.238
And that night I didn't lose my virginity

324
00:15:09.238 --> 00:15:13.738
but I lost my entire soul
and I started craving drugs.

325
00:15:14.969 --> 00:15:17.694
My grades started to slip.

326
00:15:17.694 --> 00:15:20.410
I had to drop out of school.

327
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.140
I couldn't go home.

328
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.357
So I wound up staying
off campus with Eric.

329
00:15:25.357 --> 00:15:27.524
(mumbles)

330
00:15:30.922 --> 00:15:32.397
- [Eric] Maybe we can talk and talk about

331
00:15:32.397 --> 00:15:35.755
a little bit more next time
you understand when I call you

332
00:15:35.755 --> 00:15:37.332
- Okay. well you be safe

333
00:15:37.332 --> 00:15:39.999
I love you son
- I love you too.

334
00:15:47.717 --> 00:15:50.297
- [Officer] Hey mate Robinson
you go into the infirmary.

335
00:15:50.297 --> 00:15:51.297
- Okay boss.

336
00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:03.560
- Move back from me.

337
00:16:06.957 --> 00:16:09.707
(door squeaking)

338
00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:19.546
- What's up over here.

339
00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:20.893
- Fly what's up with you.

340
00:16:20.893 --> 00:16:23.533
- Ah man. you know just
looking at these books man

341
00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:24.870
in here trying to find me a loophole

342
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.229
to get back in the courtroom man.

343
00:16:27.229 --> 00:16:28.419
- Ain't nothing wrong with that man.

344
00:16:28.419 --> 00:16:30.214
I've been nice so much.

345
00:16:30.214 --> 00:16:31.059
I just stopped at the fact

346
00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:32.510
that I'm die behind these walls.

347
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.998
- When you go back to the board?

348
00:16:33.998 --> 00:16:35.921
- I go back in 26 months

349
00:16:35.921 --> 00:16:37.742
- And hopefully they
pay you this time man.

350
00:16:37.742 --> 00:16:40.840
I mean you didn't gamble 30
bar what more do they want.

351
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.942
- Shit. they want my life.

352
00:16:42.942 --> 00:16:44.822
Shit this system was designed

353
00:16:44.822 --> 00:16:47.400
for another form of genocide against me.

354
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.086
- You got a motherfucking
point right there man.

355
00:16:50.086 --> 00:16:53.166
It's crazy how they do a
nigga in this wall man.

356
00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:55.083
Man this shit is crazy.

357
00:16:56.992 --> 00:17:01.704
All right get out there.
stay out there man for real.

358
00:17:01.704 --> 00:17:02.537

One was I can go to jail.

There's no real nigga.

427
00:19:37.082 --> 00:19:39.353

511
00:23:39.231 --> 00:23:41.939

00:24:01.803 --> 00:24:03.531
I'm thinking set up.

519
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:04.666

- Where the hell he at?

528
00:24:18.677 --> 00:24:20.021

529
00:24:20.021 --> 00:24:22.052
when I threatened to call the police.

530
00:24:22.052 --> 00:24:26.931
- Cum' on I'll take you

532
00:24:30.668 --> 00:24:32.189
We enjoyed each other's company

533

1276
01:07:21.636 --> 01:07:23.313
(door thuds)

1277
01:07:23.313 --> 01:07:27.403
- So. Mr. Wilson. this is your
fourth time coming before us?

1278
01:07:27.403 --> 01:07:28.320
- Yes it is

1279
01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.730
- You've served 30 years
in a life sentence.

1280
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:33.492
- Yes ma'am.

1281
01:07:33.492 --> 01:07:35.947
- So. it's obvious that you were denied

1282
01:07:35.947 --> 01:07:37.473
the past three times.

1283
01:07:37.473 --> 01:07:39.772
So what have you done
different that would warrant us

1284
01:07:39.772 --> 01:07:41.676
to approve your parole?

1285
01:07:41.676 --> 01:07:44.461
- Well. over the years
I have shown the same

1286
01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:49.296
exact parole board that I
have rehabilitated myself.

1287
01:07:49.296 --> 01:07:53.464
I have took every program they
had to offer. to no avail.

1288
01:07:53.464 --> 01:07:55.430
I also have stayed out of trouble

1289
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:57.694
for the majority of my time

1290
01:07:57.694 --> 01:08:01.435
but they haven't taken
that into consideration.

1291
01:08:01.435 --> 01:08:03.115
I just wanna live my life

1292
01:08:03.115 --> 01:08:06.068
outside these penitentiary walls

1293
01:08:06.068 --> 01:08:09.067
but also know that y'all
gonna deny me anyway.

1294
01:08:09.067 --> 01:08:12.817
So quite frankly. I
really don't give a damn.

1295
01:08:17.427 --> 01:08:20.393
(sighs)
- Okay. thank you Mr. Wilson

1296
01:08:20.393 --> 01:08:22.101

1301
01:08:54.238 --> 01:08:56.488

1302
01:09:14.766 --> 01:09:17.433
(water gushing)

1303
01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:33.949
(beeps)

1304
01:09:33.949 --> 01:09:35.453
- Hello. detective Brown?

1305
01:09:35.453 --> 01:09:37.953
Yes. I'm calling from the lab.

1306
01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:41.525
I just removed the casing from the victim.

1307
01:09:41.525 --> 01:09:44.578
I believe we have a match that
seems to match the firearm

1308
01:09:44.578 --> 01:09:46.578
that you guys recovered.

1309
01:09:47.706 --> 01:09:48.539
Yes

1310
01:09:53.203 --> 01:09:54.639
I will.

1311
01:09:54.639 --> 01:09:58.402
Let me know if you need anything else.

1312
01:09:58.402 --> 01:09:59.235
Goodbye

1313
01:10:03.683 --> 01:10:06.350

01:10:09.847 --> 01:10:11.512
- This is detective Clark

1315
01:10:11.512 --> 01:10:12.942

1316
01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:13.924

1317
01:10:13.924 --> 01:10:15.325
- Hey Taylor what's up?

1318
01:10:15.325 --> 01:10:16.587

1319
01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.351
from my partner detective Brown

1320
01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:20.076
and we got an update on
that double murder case

1321
01:10:20.076 --> 01:10:21.491
that happened about a week ago.

1322
01:10:21.491 --> 01:10:22.324
- Oh yeah.

1323
01:10:22.324 --> 01:10:23.578
What's the news?

1324
01:10:23.578 --> 01:10:24.411
- Well. she got a call

1325
01:10:24.411 --> 01:10:26.116
from the medical examiner's office

1326
01:10:26.116 --> 01:10:28.079
and the ballistic it matches the gun

1327
01:10:28.079 --> 01:10:29.439
that we found at the scene

1328
01:10:29.439 --> 01:10:31.088
and you won't believe this.

1329
01:10:31.088 --> 01:10:33.537
it has Taylor's finger prints on the gun.

1330
01:10:33.537 --> 01:10:35.136
- Do you want me to go pick him up

1331
01:10:35.136 --> 01:10:37.178
- Well. not quite

1332
01:10:37.178 --> 01:10:40.116

can't get a flight back tonight

1333
01:10:40.116 --> 01:10:41.587

suspect. that'll be great.

1335

You going to do that thing
for Devante tomorrow?

1858
01:37:12.765 --> 01:37:15.706
- Yeah I've been thinking
about sliding by for a minute.

1859
01:37:15.706 --> 01:37:16.735
- Perfect.

1860
01:37:16.735 --> 01:37:18.274
Look. I can't go

1861
01:37:18.274 --> 01:37:19.783
but I still want Cynthia to go.

1862
01:37:19.783 --> 01:37:20.616
- okay

1863
01:37:20.616 --> 01:37:21.749
- And I was wondering if
you can take her foe me.

1864
01:37:21.749 --> 01:37:23.259
- Yeah bro. I got you.

1865
01:37:23.259 --> 01:37:25.194
- Thank you I appreciate
- All right yoh

1866
01:37:25.194 --> 01:37:27.711
- I opened this gym up
to bring y'all in here

1867
01:37:27.711 --> 01:37:29.079
and show you something better

1868
01:37:29.079 --> 01:37:30.883
that y'all can do with your life.

1869
01:37:30.883 --> 01:37:32.169
Choose your own future man.

1870
01:37:32.169 --> 01:37:34.916
Like that system that we
have is so corrupted man

1871
01:37:34.916 --> 01:37:36.671
I sat in that prison cell for no reason.

1872
01:37:36.671 --> 01:37:37.904
for no point at all.

1873
01:37:37.904 --> 01:37:40.245
And I thought to myself I had
to get out and make a change

1874
01:37:40.245 --> 01:37:41.475
and this is what I'm doing right now.

1875
01:37:41.475 --> 01:37:44.276
I started to close the line
me and my partner got a gym.

1876
01:37:44.276 --> 01:37:46.324
We doing different things
and positive things.

1877
01:37:46.324 --> 01:37:48.539
So I wanna encourage all. man go to school

1878
01:37:48.539 --> 01:37:50.871
stay in school and don't
believe the hype man

1879
01:37:50.871 --> 01:37:52.694
be a police officer in your neighborhood.

1880
01:37:52.694 --> 01:37:54.783
Be the prosecutor man. be a judge

1881
01:37:54.783 --> 01:37:56.215
cause y'all can change the whole narrative

1882
01:37:56.215 --> 01:37:57.897
what's going on in that system.

1883
01:37:57.897 --> 01:37:59.379
We gotta get on that side of the fence

1884
01:37:59.379 --> 01:38:01.809
and make it better for
our kind and our people.

1885
01:38:01.809 --> 01:38:02.777
You gotta help each other out.

1886
01:38:02.777 --> 01:38:04.789
So. I'm encouraging y'all
do something different

1887
01:38:04.789 --> 01:38:05.622
with your life man.

1888
01:38:05.622 --> 01:38:07.112

- You can be whatever you want to be man.

1894
01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:14.887
Anything you chose to be man

1895
01:38:14.887 --> 01:38:16.760
don't let the streets choose
your future for you man

1896
01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:17.593
do something different man.

1897
01:38:17.593 --> 01:38:20.468
I was blessed with a
partner like Fly the Ohio

1898
01:38:20.468 --> 01:38:22.208
innocence project. a good lawyer

1899
01:38:22.208 --> 01:38:23.528
and that's what brought me home.

1900
01:38:23.528 --> 01:38:24.361
You know what I'm saying?

1901
01:38:24.361 --> 01:38:25.985
I could've been doing life in
jail right now but I'm here.

1902
01:38:25.985 --> 01:38:28.046
I'm here to tell y'all
do something different

1903
01:38:28.046 --> 01:38:29.782
and be a better example for y'all.

1904
01:38:29.782 --> 01:38:32.699
(door bell chimes)

1905
01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:38.694
(hands thudding)

1906
01:38:38.694 --> 01:38:39.615
- What's up with you

1907
01:38:39.615 --> 01:38:40.646

1908
01:38:40.646 --> 01:38:41.979
how old are you?

1909
01:38:51.507 --> 01:38:54.218
Yeah that's all I was saying though man

1910
01:38:54.218 --> 01:38:56.626
it's our future man. you
know what I'm saying?

1911
01:38:56.626 --> 01:38:58.774
- Player T that me Hollywood in the hood

1912
01:38:58.774 --> 01:39:00.690
I'm right here Stuff Yourself kitchen

1913
01:39:00.690 --> 01:39:03.514
for a special dedication
to Devante Williams.

1914
01:39:03.514 --> 01:39:06.514
This young man has
exemplified the true meaning

1915
01:39:06.514 --> 01:39:08.701
of taking a negative situation

1916
01:39:08.701 --> 01:39:11.445
and turn it into something positive.

1917
01:39:11.445 --> 01:39:14.364
Unfortunately. today marks
the first anniversary

1918
01:39:14.364 --> 01:39:16.490
of his death due to gun violence

1919
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:20.206
and the big question is.
when is it all going to end?

1920
01:39:20.206 --> 01:39:21.726
Now we're gonna listen in

1921
01:39:21.726 --> 01:39:25.337
to Councilman Bashir Jones
and Devontae William's mother.

1922
01:39:25.337 --> 01:39:26.212
How are you doing Councilman?

1923
01:39:26.212 --> 01:39:28.188
- I'm doing well under
the circumstance man.

1924
01:39:28.188 --> 01:39:32.628
This is a always a sad
situation when you lose life.

1925
01:39:32.628 --> 01:39:35.059
When people have to go back

1926
01:39:35.059 --> 01:39:38.061
to the creator as a
result of gun violence.

1927
01:39:38.061 --> 01:39:41.679
Over 80% of the people
who die in this city

1928
01:39:41.679 --> 01:39:44.478
they die due to gun deaths

1929
01:39:44.478 --> 01:39:45.947
and mothers have to cry

1930
01:39:45.947 --> 01:39:48.235
daughters have to bury their fathers.

1931
01:39:48.235 --> 01:39:49.698
It's a very sad situation

1932
01:39:49.698 --> 01:39:53.189
but. what I can say. that I'm happy about

1933
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:56.893
is the fact that we are here
opening up a new business

1934
01:39:56.893 --> 01:39:59.643
that will be a benefit to this community.

1935
01:39:59.643 --> 01:40:01.682
His death was not in vain

1936
01:40:01.682 --> 01:40:03.849
and his life will continue

1937
01:40:05.282 --> 01:40:07.128
right here inside this beautiful business.

1938
01:40:07.128 --> 01:40:08.971
So I'm excited to be here with you

1939
01:40:08.971 --> 01:40:11.326
to be here with the family
to be here with the mom

1940
01:40:11.326 --> 01:40:12.658
and to be with the community members

1941
01:40:12.658 --> 01:40:14.607
that we have to stop this violence.

1942
01:40:14.607 --> 01:40:16.558
We have to stop killing each other.

1943
01:40:16.558 --> 01:40:18.823
It's a beautiful quote
that says. "it's not

1944
01:40:18.823 --> 01:40:21.049
"that we don't love our
neighbors like we love ourselves.

1945
01:40:21.049 --> 01:40:23.402
"we do love our neighbors
like we love ourselves.

1946
01:40:23.402 --> 01:40:25.542
"the problem is that we
don't love ourselves."

1947
01:40:25.542 --> 01:40:27.250
So that we don't love ourselves

1948
01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:29.851
and obviously I can't love
anything that looks like me.

1949
01:40:29.851 --> 01:40:31.697
So we have to have self love.

1950
01:40:31.697 --> 01:40:34.033
So I'm here in support of the mom

1951
01:40:34.033 --> 01:40:35.550
in support of this beautiful family

1952
01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:37.492
to open up this amazing business .

1953
01:40:37.492 --> 01:40:40.175
that we hope. not only sell some good food

1954
01:40:40.175 --> 01:40:41.626
but also promotes love.

1955
01:40:41.626 --> 01:40:42.466
- You say that?

1956
01:40:42.466 --> 01:40:43.943
That's a Ricky!

1957
01:40:43.943 --> 01:40:44.901
- Ricky who?

1958
01:40:44.901 --> 01:40:48.449
- Ricky Smith. Fly's co-defendant

1959
01:40:48.449 --> 01:40:49.698
fuck!

1960
01:40:49.698 --> 01:40:50.845
Man I gotta stop him

1961
01:40:50.845 --> 01:40:53.573
before he tries something at this reunion.

1962
01:40:53.573 --> 01:40:54.406
- Thank you.

1963
01:40:54.406 --> 01:40:57.176
Well we're right here with
Devonte's mom right here.

1964
01:40:57.176 --> 01:40:58.473
How you doing ma lady?

1965
01:40:58.473 --> 01:40:59.556
- I'm good. how are you?

1966
01:40:59.556 --> 01:41:00.924
Thank you so much for coming.

1967
01:41:00.924 --> 01:41:01.882
- Right. you're welcome

1968
01:41:01.882 --> 01:41:03.596
and under the circumstances is real tough

1969
01:41:03.596 --> 01:41:05.147
you like to say any words?

1970
01:41:05.147 --> 01:41:06.145
- Absolutely.

1971
01:41:06.145 --> 01:41:09.130
Today is a very special
day for me and my family.

1972
01:41:09.130 --> 01:41:10.969
This was a really big dream of my sons

1973
01:41:10.969 --> 01:41:13.144
and there's not a day that goes by

1974
01:41:13.144 --> 01:41:14.258
that I don't think about Devontae.

1975
01:41:14.258 --> 01:41:15.123
- Right

1976
01:41:15.123 --> 01:41:16.699
- Therefore. it's only right

1977
01:41:16.699 --> 01:41:19.849
that I help him see his dreams come true.

1978
01:41:19.849 --> 01:41:23.335
Five. four .three

1979
01:41:23.335 --> 01:41:24.752
- [All] Two. one.

1980
01:41:25.852 --> 01:41:28.269
(soft music)

1981
01:41:33.779 --> 01:41:35.702
- This I'm coming with you

1982
01:41:35.702 --> 01:41:37.405
if you're not out in here by go there

1983
01:41:37.405 --> 01:41:41.822
we're shooting nothing in
five minutes. I'm coming in

1984
01:41:42.874 --> 01:41:46.707
(murmurs of playing children)

1985
01:41:57.002 --> 01:41:59.919
(distant car horn)

1986
01:42:02.102 --> 01:42:04.852
(car horn yonks)

1987
01:42:08.193 --> 01:42:10.860
(intense music)

1988
01:42:19.964 --> 01:42:24.964
(feet thudding)
(intense music continues)

1989
01:42:45.978 --> 01:42:49.811
(murmurs of playing children)

1990
01:43:06.325 --> 01:43:09.912
- So this is always been
a dream of Devantae's.

1991
01:43:09.912 --> 01:43:14.329
So without further ado. son
this is for you. scissors

1992
01:43:16.961 --> 01:43:18.516
(crowd clapping)

1993
01:43:18.516 --> 01:43:22.419
(gun shot)
(screams)

1994
01:43:22.419 --> 01:43:26.337
- Up there. the shot
came from that window.

1995
01:43:26.337 --> 01:43:29.004
(intense music)

1996
01:43:35.245 --> 01:43:36.625
- You'll right?

1997
01:43:36.625 --> 01:43:37.958
I got it. go. go

1998
01:44:12.971 --> 01:44:14.794
- Hey what the fuck!

1999
01:44:14.794 --> 01:44:16.326
- I had no choice

2000
01:44:16.326 --> 01:44:18.583
- Then how'd you get here so fast

2001
01:44:18.583 --> 01:44:21.330
- I received a tip. I
didn't have time to call in

2002
01:44:21.330 --> 01:44:24.076
so I had to just do what I have to do

2003
01:44:24.076 --> 01:44:25.294
- So you just shot him?

2004
01:44:25.294 --> 01:44:28.251
- I had to do what I had
to do. it was him or me

2005
01:44:28.251 --> 01:44:29.926
- Listen you get outta here.

2006
01:44:29.926 --> 01:44:32.009
we'll clean up this mess.

2007
01:44:36.935 --> 01:44:37.833
- So sorry.

2008
01:44:37.833 --> 01:44:41.001
So sorry to hear how
it happened. so sorry.

2009
01:44:41.001 --> 01:44:42.310
- Thank y'all for coming

2010
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:43.602
- There's no way that..

2011
01:44:43.602 --> 01:44:45.150
I know nothing that I can say right now

2012
01:44:45.150 --> 01:44:47.953
that can make it better.
but I just want you to know that

2013
01:44:47.953 --> 01:44:51.816
whatever whatever me
and my community can do

2014
01:44:51.816 --> 01:44:53.976
to be of assistance to you we will

2015
01:44:53.976 --> 01:44:55.040
- Okay
- we will be here for you.

2016
01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:56.839
I promise you that.
- Thank you.
- Promise you that

2017
01:44:56.839 --> 01:44:57.895
- I appreciate you.

2018
01:44:57.895 --> 01:44:59.088
- God bless you. okay.
- I love you

2019
01:44:59.088 --> 01:45:01.427
- Thank you sister. thank you

2020
01:45:01.427 --> 01:45:03.344
- Thank you for coming.

2021
01:45:06.196 --> 01:45:07.029
Thank you.

2022
01:45:10.456 --> 01:45:11.289
- Hey you.

2023
01:45:14.591 --> 01:45:16.508
stay right here sweetie

2024
01:45:20.881 --> 01:45:21.714
- Hey

2025
01:45:21.714 --> 01:45:23.968
- I heard it was Ricky
up in that building.

2026
01:45:23.968 --> 01:45:25.538
- Ricky?

2027
01:45:25.538 --> 01:45:28.804
- I think he was trying to kill Pablo.

2028
01:45:28.804 --> 01:45:30.963
- It all makes sense now.

2029
01:45:30.963 --> 01:45:33.966
Girl Pablo just recently found out

2030
01:45:33.966 --> 01:45:38.961
that Ricky was his son from
his ex-wife down in Florida

2031
01:45:38.961 --> 01:45:41.160
- But what would he have against Fly?

2032
01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:43.286
- That's a question I'm
still trying to figure out.

2033
01:45:43.286 --> 01:45:45.660
All I know is he never respected the fact

2034
01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:47.314
that Pablo came back to Cleveland

2035
01:45:47.314 --> 01:45:51.843
and left him and his
family in Florida for dead.

2036
01:45:51.843 --> 01:45:55.343
(soft instrumental music)

2037
01:46:55.985 --> 01:46:57.589
- Hey grand dad.

2038
01:46:57.589 --> 01:46:59.006
- Hey grand baby.

2039
01:47:01.518 --> 01:47:02.583
Where your grandma at?

2040
01:47:02.583 --> 01:47:04.829
- She back there in the back.

2041
01:47:04.829 --> 01:47:08.146
- I see you getting that
money. its in your blood line.

2042
01:47:08.146 --> 01:47:09.139
- My DNA

2043
01:47:09.139 --> 01:47:11.235
- Is a good thing when we could
spend the rest of our lives

2044
01:47:11.235 --> 01:47:14.181
with the ones we love. we
must cherish every moment

2045
01:47:14.181 --> 01:47:15.652
we get on this earth

2046
01:47:15.652 --> 01:47:18.336
and make sure we tell our
loved ones we love them.

2047
01:47:18.336 --> 01:47:20.080
Tomorrow's not promised to us.
