00:34:20.836 --> 00:34:22.437
And I want you to know
if it's important to you.

708
00:34:22.533 --> 00:34:24.613
it's important to me.
It's just a little gift.

709
00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:28.261
You. thank you. thank you.

710
00:34:28.677 --> 00:34:29.988
Mmm.

711
00:34:31.812 --> 00:34:35.748
Franklin. did you
get a new toy or...

712
00:34:37.925 --> 00:34:38.821
You wanna see it?

713
00:34:38.917 --> 00:34:39.781
Yeah.
Yeah?

714
00:34:43.267 --> 00:34:45.220
I don't know if it's.
it might be too much.

715
00:34:45.316 --> 00:34:46.437
Franklin.
I love it.

716
00:34:46.533 --> 00:34:48.132
I hate parking it
out here. you know.

717
00:34:48.228 --> 00:34:50.533
Franklin. put this in
a parking lot immediately.

718
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:51.717
Yeah.
Yeah.

719
00:34:51.812 --> 00:34:52.677
Do you see where we are?

720
00:34:52.772 --> 00:34:53.605
I know.
Yeah.

721
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:56.229
[phone buzzing]

722
00:34:57.381 --> 00:34:58.373
Hello?

723
00:34:58.469 --> 00:34:59.877
[Anton] <i>Is now a good time?</i>

724
00:34:59.973 --> 00:35:01.221
Excuse me?

725
00:35:01.317 --> 00:35:02.789
[Anton] <i>The interview</i>
<i>you wanted.</i>

726
00:35:03.427 --> 00:35:04.581

727
00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.524
Uh. like right now. right now?

728
00:35:07.621 --> 00:35:09.477
[Anton] <i>Uh.</i>
<i>if you're available?</i>

729
00:35:10.116 --> 00:35:11.716
Yeah. yeah. I'm.
I'm available.

730
00:35:11.813 --> 00:35:12.932
[Anton] <i>Good.</i>

731
00:35:13.669 --> 00:35:15.204
<i>I've provided transportation.</i>

732
00:35:15.301 --> 00:35:16.293
Transportation?

00:35:18.213 --> 00:35:20.485
[mysterious music]

734
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.181
[Anton] <i>See you soon. Mr. Fox.</i>

735
00:35:24.101 --> 00:35:24.965
Thank you.

736
00:35:28.452 --> 00:35:29.701
Here. have fun.

737
00:35:29.797 --> 00:35:31.045
I'll see you later.

738
00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.677
[Jala] All right.
well. good luck.

739
00:35:34.147 --> 00:35:35.493

00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:38.373

[ethereal music]

742
00:35:45.029 --> 00:35:46.213
[Anton] Mr. Fox.

743
00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:49.733
My hero.

744
00:35:50.885 --> 00:35:52.069
Welcome.

745
00:35:52.165 --> 00:35:53.956
Ingram will show you
to the boardroom.

00:36:00.261 --> 00:36:02.565
[electronic chirping]

747
00:36:03.717 --> 00:36:07.173
Oh. Mr. Burrell. thank you
so much for taking the time.

748
00:36:07.269 --> 00:36:10.660
No. sir. thank you for
your quick thinking.

749
00:36:10.757 --> 00:36:14.053
Oh. I. uh. just.
just reacted. sir.

750
00:36:14.149 --> 00:36:15.492
I'm not. not a fighter.

751
00:36:16.229 --> 00:36:17.380
I have a gift.

752
00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:18.789
Oh.

753
00:36:20.773 --> 00:36:23.781
You might wanna come closer.

754
00:36:23.877 --> 00:36:25.189
Right.

755
00:36:35.749 --> 00:36:38.949
[contemplative music]

756
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:42.916
Thank you. Ingram.

757
00:36:44.549 --> 00:36:47.525
Here. for you.

758
00:36:49.189 --> 00:36:50.916
[electronic chirping]
Are these the new Fives?

759
00:36:51.012 --> 00:36:54.117
No. but they're
the best you can get.

760
00:36:54.213 --> 00:36:57.029
Unless you're me.
For you and your lady friend.

761
00:36:58.213 --> 00:36:59.365
I do my homework.

762
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.925
I know that you were
a graduate of MIT.

763
00:37:02.021 --> 00:37:04.485
I know that you started
your own biotech company

764
00:37:04.581 --> 00:37:07.685
with your sister.
whom you lost to...

765
00:37:08.549 --> 00:37:10.980
well. let's say
unfortunate circumstances.

766
00:37:13.797 --> 00:37:14.852
Questions?

767
00:37:15.525 --> 00:37:16.900
Sorry?
[Anton] Your interview.

768
00:37:16.997 --> 00:37:18.117
Oh.
Questions.

769
00:37:18.213 --> 00:37:20.964
Unless you read minds.
No. no. I do not.

770
00:37:21.061 --> 00:37:25.125
Uh... I was thinking we could.
we could start big. Um...

771
00:37:26.116 --> 00:37:27.941
So do. do you
believe that one day

772
00:37:28.036 --> 00:37:30.373
your Tri-Band technology
will be

773
00:37:30.469 --> 00:37:33.029
a viable alternative
to medication.

774
00:37:33.124 --> 00:37:35.141
pills. syrups. inhalers?

775
00:37:38.852 --> 00:37:40.453
Alternative would be nice.

776
00:37:41.827 --> 00:37:44.197
Complete replacement
would be best.

777
00:37:44.901 --> 00:37:50.116
A technology that makes
medication an unnecessary...

778
00:37:52.773 --> 00:37:54.405
barbaric relic.

779
00:37:54.501 --> 00:37:55.941
But not all medical needs

780
00:37:56.037 --> 00:37:58.404
stem from poor
healthcare habits.

781
00:37:58.501 --> 00:38:01.797
What about accidents?
Car crash. ski injury. falls.

782
00:38:01.892 --> 00:38:04.836
What besides medication
can manage pain?

783
00:38:04.933 --> 00:38:06.885
You're asking
the wrong questions.

784
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:12.837
It's not what do we need
to manage pain from accidents.

785
00:38:13.797 --> 00:38:16.453
It's why have accidents
in the first place?

786
00:38:18.437 --> 00:38:19.973
Let's step outside a minute.

787
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:21.605
I'm feeling a little
claustrophobic.

788
00:38:21.701 --> 00:38:22.629
OK? Come on.

789
00:38:27.429 --> 00:38:28.677
In the future.

790
00:38:28.772 --> 00:38:31.333
your Tri-Bands are gonna
eliminate accidents?

791
00:38:31.429 --> 00:38:32.805
Not Tri-Bands.

792
00:38:32.901 --> 00:38:35.236
What I'm working on
will make Tri-Bands

793
00:38:35.333 --> 00:38:37.893
as antiquated
as a rotary telephone.

794
00:38:39.973 --> 00:38:41.765
The platform has limitations.

795
00:38:42.661 --> 00:38:44.132
It's reactive.

796
00:38:44.228 --> 00:38:46.533
In order to eliminate accidents.

797
00:38:46.629 --> 00:38:48.869
we're gonna need
a proactive solution.

798
00:38:48.964 --> 00:38:51.173
And you have one?

799
00:38:52.933 --> 00:38:54.084
Off the record?

800
00:38:54.853 --> 00:38:56.453
[Franklin] Sure.

801
00:38:56.549 --> 00:38:58.564
Years ago.
I stumbled on a substance

802
00:38:58.661 --> 00:39:01.221
that contained
quantum particles.

803
00:39:01.317 --> 00:39:03.141
Like quantum crystals.
Mm-hmm.

804
00:39:03.845 --> 00:39:05.381
I thought those were
just recently discovered.

805
00:39:05.477 --> 00:39:07.557
Oh. well. that's
what the world thinks.

806
00:39:07.941 --> 00:39:09.381
I discovered them decades ago

807
00:39:09.477 --> 00:39:13.988
while working on laser
technology. but early sixties.

808
00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.941
man of my complexion...

809
00:39:16.037 --> 00:39:18.373
How long would it be before
the technology gets stolen

810
00:39:18.469 --> 00:39:19.781
or I wound up dead?

811
00:39:19.877 --> 00:39:24.389
So I just kept it secret
and kept experimenting.

812
00:39:24.965 --> 00:39:27.461
But I do believe
that integrating AI

813
00:39:27.557 --> 00:39:30.277
with this substance
will eliminate accidents.

814
00:39:31.268 --> 00:39:32.549
No accidents.

815
00:39:32.645 --> 00:39:35.108
no injuries.
no injuries. no pain.

816
00:39:35.205 --> 00:39:38.213
No pain.
no need for medication.

817
00:39:38.629 --> 00:39:40.101
That. that sounds incredible.

818
00:39:40.197 --> 00:39:43.013
Well. forgive me
for sounding immodest.

819
00:39:43.685 --> 00:39:47.365
but if I'm truthful.
incredible is what I do.

820
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.413
[chuckling]

821
00:39:49.508 --> 00:39:52.388
But you weren't being honest
with me completely before.

822
00:39:55.013 --> 00:39:55.909
About?

823
00:39:56.005 --> 00:39:57.765
About being a fighter.

824
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:02.405
Look. I sense that
you're a modest man.

825
00:40:03.077 --> 00:40:05.828
Power and material things
don't hold much pull.

826
00:40:06.693 --> 00:40:09.668
But I also detect
a desire for justice.

827
00:40:09.765 --> 00:40:12.005
desire to make
the world a better place.

828
00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:16.837
Don't let
the intellectual fear in here

829
00:40:16.933 --> 00:40:20.133
keep you from pursuing
what's burning in here.

830
00:40:22.917 --> 00:40:24.005
Jay. do you.

831
00:40:24.645 --> 00:40:28.293
do you think that I should take
that meeting with Thorenson?

832
00:40:31.269 --> 00:40:32.708
What. you go see an angel

833
00:40:32.805 --> 00:40:34.661
and then you gonna go
meet with the devil?

834
00:40:34.757 --> 00:40:38.501
I mean. didn't you say
that he killed your sister?

835
00:40:39.205 --> 00:40:41.317
Yeah. but it's just.
just a meeting.

836
00:40:41.413 --> 00:40:43.909
You know. maybe I can.
I don't know.

837
00:40:44.005 --> 00:40:47.173
maybe I can get him to slip up
and say something he shouldn't.

838
00:40:48.389 --> 00:40:50.948
Blow it out to the world.
I don't know.

839
00:40:51.045 --> 00:40:52.868
Could be a little
bit of justice.

840
00:40:53.605 --> 00:40:56.389
[both mumbling]

841
00:40:56.485 --> 00:40:57.541
OK.

842
00:40:58.533 --> 00:40:59.813
[Franklin] <i>Despite the effort.</i>

843
00:40:59.909 --> 00:41:01.637
<i>I couldn't get Burrell's</i>
<i>words out of my head.</i>

844
00:41:01.733 --> 00:41:03.109
<i>I did have a desire</i>
<i>for justice.</i>

845
00:41:03.205 --> 00:41:04.869
<i>a fire burning inside of me.</i>

846
00:41:04.965 --> 00:41:07.141
<i>This was an opportunity to</i>
<i>confront the man responsible</i>

847
00:41:07.237 --> 00:41:08.741
<i>for my sister's death.</i>

848
00:41:08.836 --> 00:41:10.277
<i>And I wanted to take that fire</i>

849
00:41:10.373 --> 00:41:13.253
<i>and use it to light</i>
<i>Sig Thorenson the fuck up.</i>

850
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:15.653
<i>All I had to do was</i>
<i>push past my fear.</i>

851
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.765
<i>All I had to do</i>
<i>was take action.</i>

852
00:41:18.788 --> 00:41:20.165
[Calvert laughing]

853
00:41:20.261 --> 00:41:21.253
Change of heart.

854
00:41:22.276 --> 00:41:23.461
Good man.

855
00:41:26.853 --> 00:41:27.781
Follow me.

856
00:41:27.877 --> 00:41:28.805
[Franklin] All right.

857
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:34.404
[Calvert] Mr. Thorenson.
meet Franklin Fox.

858
00:41:38.533 --> 00:41:40.101
Franklin Fox.

859
00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:41.093
Sig Thorenson.

860
00:41:42.245 --> 00:41:44.581
That beautiful woman
there is Renee Renzler.

861
00:41:44.677 --> 00:41:46.661
Brilliant mind. keeps
my business afloat.

862
00:41:46.757 --> 00:41:48.069
which is why
I don't have a problem

863
00:41:48.165 --> 00:41:50.341
that she won't give me
the time of day outside of work.

864
00:41:50.437 --> 00:41:52.133
Isn't that right. Calvert?

865
00:41:52.709 --> 00:41:57.733
But as you can see.
I do all right.

866
00:41:58.309 --> 00:42:00.901
Mmm. Give me a minute.
sweetheart. OK?

867
00:42:00.997 --> 00:42:03.141
Oh. ignore the
naysayers. Franklin.

868
00:42:03.237 --> 00:42:07.077
'cause money can buy you
happiness. and a lot of it.

869
00:42:07.173 --> 00:42:08.869
You want. you wanna
meet her girlfriends?

870
00:42:08.964 --> 00:42:11.588
Oh no. I'm good. I don't mix
business and pleasure.

871
00:42:11.685 --> 00:42:13.989
Oh. dull. but I like it.

872
00:42:14.085 --> 00:42:15.525
No. Renson Pharmaceuticals

873
00:42:15.621 --> 00:42:17.285
could use a persuasive
voice like yours

874
00:42:17.381 --> 00:42:19.365
to help us regain
some goodwill.

875
00:42:19.461 --> 00:42:20.869
'Cause fact is.
Zonastin has helped a.

876
00:42:20.966 --> 00:42:23.333
a lot of people
dealing with pain.

877
00:42:23.429 --> 00:42:25.830
Like it helped my sister?
Hmm?

878
00:42:25.925 --> 00:42:27.429
Took away her pain.
Oh?

879
00:42:27.525 --> 00:42:30.373
Took it away permanently
'cause it killed her.

880
00:42:31.845 --> 00:42:34.181
You knew about the dangers
of that drug and you put it out.

881
00:42:34.276 --> 00:42:37.925
So my truth is her death
is on your fucking hands.

882
00:42:38.949 --> 00:42:40.837
[chuckling]

883
00:42:40.933 --> 00:42:42.213
Well. this is awkward.

884
00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:46.021
Anything else before you
become a broken memory?

885
00:42:46.501 --> 00:42:47.557
Yeah.

886
00:42:47.941 --> 00:42:50.021
This.
[Sig grunting]

887
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:52.646
Renson Pharmaceuticals
could use a--

888
00:42:52.741 --> 00:42:55.813
A persuasive of voice like mine
to help this company regain

889
00:42:55.909 --> 00:42:57.765
some goodwill.
get your story out there.

890
00:42:57.861 --> 00:42:59.653
I mean. the truth is.
Zonastin. it's.

891
00:42:59.749 --> 00:43:02.437
it's helped so many people
with so much pain.

892
00:43:02.533 --> 00:43:03.684
[Sig stammering]

893
00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:05.733
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

894
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:06.821
[Franklin] Oh.

895
00:43:06.916 --> 00:43:08.421
Calvert says you have a gift.

896
00:43:08.517 --> 00:43:12.965
Right. you have a. a lucky
streak like nobody's business.

897
00:43:13.061 --> 00:43:15.845
Not so much luck as it is.
um. it's more of a skill.

898
00:43:16.261 --> 00:43:17.574
You know. I can.
I can see things.

899
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:19.365
but my. my abilities
are rather limited.

900
00:43:19.462 --> 00:43:21.637
I can only see things that
are just about to happen.

901
00:43:21.733 --> 00:43:25.797
So you can see
what I'm thinking.

902
00:43:26.373 --> 00:43:27.589
Yeah.

903
00:43:27.684 --> 00:43:29.541
You're thinking that
I'm full of shit.

904
00:43:29.637 --> 00:43:31.876
[laughing]

905
00:43:31.974 --> 00:43:33.349
I like that. I like that.

906
00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.013
I'll tell you what.
let's make a wager. Hmm?

907
00:43:35.108 --> 00:43:37.445
You prove Calvert right

908
00:43:37.541 --> 00:43:40.357
and I'll pay you. I don't know.
what do you get for an article?

909
00:43:40.453 --> 00:43:41.445
About a thousand.

910
00:43:41.542 --> 00:43:42.693
All right.
you prove Calvert right

911
00:43:42.788 --> 00:43:43.909
and for every article you write

912
00:43:44.004 --> 00:43:45.316
that tells the world
Sig Thorenson

913
00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:47.621
knew nothing about the
addictive effects of Zonastin

914
00:43:47.717 --> 00:43:50.021
and elevates the Renson
Pharmaceutical name.

915
00:43:50.116 --> 00:43:53.348
I will multiply that by 100.

916
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:55.268
100.000?

917
00:43:55.365 --> 00:43:56.773
A small price
for good publicity.

918
00:43:56.870 --> 00:44:01.061
Fail and I fire Calvert
for telling a ridiculous lie

919
00:44:01.157 --> 00:44:03.333
or being too stupid
to see through your scam.

920
00:44:03.429 --> 00:44:06.245
And you owe me five articles
at half your going rate.

921
00:44:07.301 --> 00:44:08.229
What do you say?

922
00:44:09.125 --> 00:44:10.374
I say you name the game.

923
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:12.453
Ah. no. no. no. no game. no.

924
00:44:12.548 --> 00:44:15.333
You simply tell me
what will happen...

925
00:44:17.094 --> 00:44:18.308
after I whistle.

926
00:44:18.405 --> 00:44:21.765
You're gonna whistle?
And you predict the outcome.

927
00:44:22.245 --> 00:44:24.549
Come on. 100K if you
can do it right now.

928
00:44:24.645 --> 00:44:25.957
Let's have some fun.

929
00:44:26.469 --> 00:44:27.622
Sure. Uh...

930
00:44:27.718 --> 00:44:29.701
OK. uh. you're gonna whistle

931
00:44:29.797 --> 00:44:31.109
and then your dog's

932
00:44:31.205 --> 00:44:33.286
gonna come running from
outside and jump in your lap.

933
00:44:33.382 --> 00:44:34.725
Ah.

934
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:38.565
[Sig whistles]

935
00:44:41.126 --> 00:44:43.141
[woman grunting]

936
00:44:48.421 --> 00:44:50.149
Mmm.

937
00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:53.253
Calvert. you're fired.

938
00:44:53.733 --> 00:44:55.973
and Franklin.
you owe me five articles.

939
00:44:57.573 --> 00:44:59.461
No. no. no. no game. no.

940
00:44:59.557 --> 00:45:02.021
You simply tell me
what will happen...

941
00:45:04.198 --> 00:45:05.253
after I whistle.

942
00:45:05.348 --> 00:45:06.469
So you're gonna whistle.

943
00:45:06.564 --> 00:45:09.221
And you predict the outcome.

944
00:45:10.757 --> 00:45:12.165
Yep.

945
00:45:12.261 --> 00:45:14.981
So the woman that was just here
behind you is gonna return.

946
00:45:15.077 --> 00:45:16.582
She's gonna trip along her way.

947
00:45:16.678 --> 00:45:17.989
Come around. kiss your neck

948
00:45:18.084 --> 00:45:19.653
and put her hands
on your shoulders.

949
00:45:19.748 --> 00:45:21.157
Maybe you get a massage.

950
00:45:22.149 --> 00:45:23.237
[scoffs]

951
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.629
[Sig whistles]

952
00:45:29.253 --> 00:45:30.917
[woman grunting]

953
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:38.981
What the...

954
00:45:39.077 --> 00:45:40.773
[Franklin chuckling]

955
00:45:41.382 --> 00:45:43.044
It's not bad. huh?

956
00:45:44.869 --> 00:45:47.781
How'd you...? [wheezes]

957
00:45:52.388 --> 00:45:54.181
[engine rumbling]

958
00:45:54.277 --> 00:45:55.493
[tires squealing]

959
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:57.669
Anton Burrell's behind
this magic act somehow.

960
00:45:57.766 --> 00:45:58.694
I can feel it.

961
00:45:59.429 --> 00:46:00.901
Sig. are you sure about this?

962
00:46:00.997 --> 00:46:01.988
Him working here?

963
00:46:02.085 --> 00:46:03.526
Put him in the corporate office.

964
00:46:03.622 --> 00:46:06.502
No. Friends close.
enemies closer.

965
00:46:07.173 --> 00:46:10.470
It's trite. but it's...
it's true.

966
00:46:10.565 --> 00:46:14.086
[thunder rumbling]
[rain pattering]

967
00:46:15.845 --> 00:46:19.173
So he wants you to write an
article to make him look good?

968
00:46:19.268 --> 00:46:20.837
Yeah. 100K a pop.

969
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:23.750
But. Franklin.
that's like selling out

970
00:46:23.846 --> 00:46:25.606
all the people
who read your blog

971
00:46:25.702 --> 00:46:27.013
and your sister.

972
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:28.710
You're just gonna
let him buy you?

973
00:46:28.805 --> 00:46:30.310
Jala. come on. it's
not about the money.

974
00:46:30.949 --> 00:46:32.422
You don't think I
wanted to kill him

975
00:46:32.518 --> 00:46:33.989
when I was standing
in front of him?

976
00:46:34.085 --> 00:46:36.070
But if I go and work for him.
you realize I can get like.

977
00:46:36.166 --> 00:46:37.958
deep in underground
and get some actual proof

978
00:46:38.054 --> 00:46:39.428
that he knew about
Zonastin the entire time

979
00:46:39.525 --> 00:46:40.773
and mess up his entire world.

980
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:44.389
While writing glowing
reviews about the man. Mm...

981
00:46:44.902 --> 00:46:45.766
Yeah.

982
00:46:46.854 --> 00:46:47.717
No. I know.

983
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:51.398
I'll find a way around that.

984
00:46:51.494 --> 00:46:52.390
In the meantime.

985
00:46:53.285 --> 00:46:54.342
I'll take his money

986
00:46:54.917 --> 00:46:57.605
and I'll use it for something
worthwhile. like us.

987
00:46:57.701 --> 00:46:59.142
Us?
Yeah. Us.

988
00:46:59.237 --> 00:47:01.541
We can move outta this
shithole. get an insane house.

989
00:47:01.637 --> 00:47:04.388
I can fill it with paints
and easels and. and...

990
00:47:04.485 --> 00:47:06.564
Franklin. this
sounds like some...

991
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:10.309
backward-ass marriage proposal.
I don't...

992
00:47:17.828 --> 00:47:19.973
[drawer scraping]
[thunder rumbling]

993
00:47:29.862 --> 00:47:31.237
Hey.
Hm?

994
00:47:31.333 --> 00:47:33.093
You know I'm crazy.

995
00:47:33.188 --> 00:47:35.333
Yeah.
You know I'm crazy about you.

996
00:47:38.885 --> 00:47:41.861
This was my grandma's.
she gave it to my sister.

997
00:47:41.957 --> 00:47:44.486
I want to marry you.
I don't wanna waste any time.

998
00:47:44.581 --> 00:47:46.406
I want to be crazy together.
Let's just do it.

999
00:47:46.501 --> 00:47:48.709
Frank-Franklin. um...

1000
00:47:49.541 --> 00:47:51.428
Ah. it's too crazy.

1001
00:47:51.525 --> 00:47:52.870
No. no. no.
It's not too crazy.

1002
00:47:52.966 --> 00:47:56.038
I. you know what you want
and I. I. I want it too.

1003
00:47:56.133 --> 00:47:57.606
You want that too?
Yes. Put the ring on.

1004
00:47:57.702 --> 00:47:59.429
Really?
Franklin. please!

1005
00:47:59.973 --> 00:48:01.414
Yeah.
That's it. that's it.

1006
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:04.133
[both laughing]

1007
00:48:05.957 --> 00:48:07.302
[Sig] So what are you thinking?

1008
00:48:07.973 --> 00:48:09.573
[Franklin] Well.
I was thinking instead

1009
00:48:09.668 --> 00:48:10.949
of doing a bunch
of little articles.

1010
00:48:11.046 --> 00:48:13.958
why don't we do one
big event-style piece

1011
00:48:14.054 --> 00:48:16.613
where we completely rebrand
Renson Pharmaceuticals

1012
00:48:16.709 --> 00:48:17.541
and yourself?

1013
00:48:17.637 --> 00:48:19.205
What. like that
circus Burrell does?

1014
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:21.766
Well. I was thinking
something more in line of

1015
00:48:21.862 --> 00:48:23.077
Renson Pharmaceuticals'
connection

1016
00:48:23.173 --> 00:48:24.293
to the community and health.

1017
00:48:24.389 --> 00:48:25.446
Time and cost.

1018
00:48:25.542 --> 00:48:27.269
[Sig stammers]
Yeah.

1019
00:48:27.366 --> 00:48:29.414
Time and cost.
It's not a fast process.

1020
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:34.054
I would say... six months
to get it done right. Um...

1021
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:36.741
You need a lot of time to
really dig into the company and.

1022
00:48:36.837 --> 00:48:38.597
you know. products and the
pipeline. that sort of thing.

1023
00:48:38.693 --> 00:48:40.485
As far as cost. I can create
a budget for you.

1024
00:48:40.581 --> 00:48:42.086
There's a shareholders'
meeting in August.

1025
00:48:42.181 --> 00:48:43.429
I know that.

1026
00:48:43.524 --> 00:48:45.477
So there's a shareholders'
meeting in August.

1027
00:48:45.574 --> 00:48:47.622
You know. I was gonna
pay you per article.

1028
00:48:47.717 --> 00:48:49.957
but what the hell. Renee.
put him on payroll.

1029
00:48:50.053 --> 00:48:52.358
Let's amortize
his articles over a year.

1030
00:48:52.454 --> 00:48:53.925
Are you sure?
Absolutely.

1031
00:48:54.437 --> 00:48:55.621
You good with that?
Yes. yeah.

1032
00:48:55.717 --> 00:48:56.805
[Sig] Great.

1033
00:48:56.901 --> 00:48:58.597
So now you work for me.

1034
00:48:58.693 --> 00:49:00.134
Big money. big results.

1035
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:01.990
[pensive music]

1036
00:49:02.086 --> 00:49:03.142
Got it.

1037
00:49:03.238 --> 00:49:06.213
[footsteps echoing]

1038
00:49:14.085 --> 00:49:15.877
You'll be in here.

1039
00:49:15.973 --> 00:49:18.661
Sig is in the next wing
and I'm just down the hall.

1040
00:49:18.757 --> 00:49:19.941
OK. Thank you.

1041
00:49:20.901 --> 00:49:21.893
OK.

1042
00:49:24.581 --> 00:49:25.830
[door closes]

1043
00:49:37.606 --> 00:49:38.597
Hi.

1044
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:41.190
Hi.

1045
00:49:42.342 --> 00:49:43.877
And you are...?

1046
00:49:44.518 --> 00:49:45.958
First-day present.

1047
00:49:48.038 --> 00:49:48.902
Oh.

1048
00:49:49.254 --> 00:49:50.373
Um...

1049
00:49:53.221 --> 00:49:54.694
[Sig chuckling]

1050
00:49:59.941 --> 00:50:01.478
Is he...?

1051
00:50:03.494 --> 00:50:04.390
Oh...

1052
00:50:05.606 --> 00:50:07.302
Goddamn Boy Scout.

1053
00:50:08.262 --> 00:50:10.118
We're gonna have to
rethink our collateral.

1054
00:50:10.214 --> 00:50:11.845
[Sig] We gotta figure out
how he does that trick.

1055
00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:13.350
And it better not
have anything to do

1056
00:50:13.445 --> 00:50:15.846
with that ridiculous Tri-Band.

1057
00:50:15.942 --> 00:50:18.054
Maybe we need to see
if he can do the trick

was more. what's the secret?

00:56:42.598 --> 00:56:44.582
[Sig] Inquiring minds
need to know.

1228
00:56:44.678 --> 00:56:48.166
Hey. Sport. did you
hear what he said?

1229
00:56:49.574 --> 00:56:50.918
Sig Thorenson?

I'm all right. I'm all right.

[contemplative music]

Oh God.

Of course.
Because I don't know.

1250
00:57:47.942 --> 00:57:50.117

All right. I'll.
I'll come on one condition.

1255
00:57:59.302 --> 00:58:01.350

Getting a little tired

How can I help?

1292
00:59:13.767 --> 00:59:15.751
Well. I was gonna
see if you had a file

1293
00:59:15.846 --> 00:59:18.246
on an old employee.
Susan Miller.

1294
00:59:19.686 --> 00:59:20.965
Why would you want that?

1295
00:59:21.062 --> 00:59:23.526
Her husband's the one
who tried to kill Sig.

1296
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:26.886
She knew about Zonastin's
propensity for addiction.

1297
00:59:26.982 --> 00:59:28.262
didn't tell anybody.

1298
00:59:28.358 --> 00:59:30.119
and Thorenson still catches
some heat because of it.

1299
00:59:30.213 --> 00:59:33.702
She had a financial
stake in its success.

1300
00:59:33.797 --> 00:59:36.582
I guess money was more
important to her than lives.

1301
00:59:36.677 --> 00:59:38.918
That's why I'd like to learn
a little bit more about her.

1302
00:59:39.014 --> 00:59:40.390
See. I wanna know
as much as possible

1303
00:59:40.486 --> 00:59:41.477
while I'm trying to game plan

1304
00:59:41.575 --> 00:59:42.693
how to reframe
the whole company.

1305
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:44.455
and having her employee file

1306
00:59:44.551 --> 00:59:46.086
might lend me some
helpful insight.

1308
00:59:50.247 --> 00:59:51.910

Thanks. Renee.

1310
00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:58.598
You know. if I can clear
out whatever dark cloud

1311
00:59:58.694 --> 01:00:01.222
is still left over
Mr. Thorenson and this company.

1312
01:00:01.318 --> 01:00:03.334
that's when I'll
call myself a hero.

1313
01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:07.814
I'm just saying. Mr. Thorenson.

1314
01:00:08.646 --> 01:00:11.526
he saved Burrell and then you.

1315
01:00:14.342 --> 01:00:15.846
I think he set it up.

1316
01:00:15.942 --> 01:00:18.854
[Sig] Well. maybe that's because
he was doing your job. Calvert.

1317
01:00:19.814 --> 01:00:24.134
Sig. Franklin just asked
to see Susan Miller's file.

1318

You see?

1319
01:00:25.094 --> 01:00:26.342
[Sig] Yeah. maybe I do.

1320
01:00:26.438 --> 01:00:28.165
I mean. maybe it's
an innocent question.

1321
01:00:28.262 --> 01:00:33.062
Maybe I need to thank
Mr. Fox properly

1322
01:00:33.158 --> 01:00:34.278
for doing your job.

1323
01:00:35.686 --> 01:00:37.223
[knocking on door]

1324
01:00:37.319 --> 01:00:38.342
Franklin.
Yeah.

1325
01:00:38.438 --> 01:00:39.942
I had Renee pull this
from the safe.

1326
01:00:40.038 --> 01:00:43.111
Susan Miller. Renee said
you wanted to see it.

1327
01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:47.046
Oh. yeah. but I.
I thought that you were...

1328
01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:50.310
It's empty.
Yeah.

1329
01:00:50.406 --> 01:00:52.998
Her not telling us what
she knew about Zonastin

1330
01:00:53.094 --> 01:00:54.726
cost us a lot of credibility.

1331
01:00:54.822 --> 01:00:57.511
We probably should
have kept her records.

1332
01:00:57.606 --> 01:01:00.327
I mean. hindsight. your
instincts were correct.

1333
01:01:00.422 --> 01:01:01.382
And that's undeniable.

I. I want to thank you.

No. I want to thank you.

I like that.

can I do you for?

How about a couple of shots?

1361
01:01:58.791 --> 01:02:00.006
Tequila.

01:02:00.102 --> 01:02:01.446

have arranged for boys?

You're about to be real good.

photogenic. Franklin.

Oh. fuck.

1399
01:03:47.622 --> 01:03:49.606
Hey. is he still here?

1400
01:03:49.702 --> 01:03:51.494
Oh. he left a few hours ago.

1401
01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:53.478
But he told me to give you this

1402
01:03:53.574 --> 01:03:55.494
when you were good
enough to drive.

1403
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:59.879
Come on. what?

1404
01:03:59.973 --> 01:04:01.607
You didn't have a good time?

1405
01:04:01.703 --> 01:04:02.822
Some gorgeous girls in there.

1406
01:04:02.918 --> 01:04:04.230
You spiked my fucking drink.

1407
01:04:04.327 --> 01:04:06.471
That was a part
of the good time.

That fool's gonna kill
himself in that thing.

1412
01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:24.102
Hey. hey.

1413
01:04:24.198 --> 01:04:25.383
Sorry. sorry I'm so late.

1414
01:04:25.479 --> 01:04:27.399
I. I got held up in
a meeting with Thorenson.

1415
01:04:27.495 --> 01:04:28.391
[Anton] Franklin?

1416
01:04:29.447 --> 01:04:30.438
Mr. Burrell.

1417
01:04:31.463 --> 01:04:33.191
What? What's. what's going on?

1418
01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:34.983
Oh. you mean what went on?

1419
01:04:36.102 --> 01:04:38.855
Exhibition of paintings
by this talented young lady

1420
01:04:38.951 --> 01:04:40.486
you're engaged to.

1421
01:04:41.446 --> 01:04:43.142
Yeah. he just
stopped by the gallery.

1422
01:04:43.238 --> 01:04:45.093
I find her paintings
so intriguing

1423
01:04:45.189 --> 01:04:46.662
that I had to see some more

1424
01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:49.029
before I decided
which one to buy.

1425
01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:50.471
Couldn't decide.

1426
01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:52.295
He brought them all.

1427
01:04:52.966 --> 01:04:56.613
I just might have made
her independently wealthy.

1428
01:04:57.734 --> 01:05:01.382
And you. woo.
so full of surprises.

1429
01:05:01.478 --> 01:05:03.783
Predictive analysis
be damned. huh?

1430
01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:10.149
Saving Thorenson? Didn't see
that one on the horizon.

1432

Did. did he just say...

1433
01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.702
You took a meeting
with Thorenson?

1434
01:05:22.407 --> 01:05:23.462
Yeah.

1435
01:05:24.774 --> 01:05:25.863
You think these things
are spying--

1436
01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:27.239
Franklin. forget
the. the Tri-Band.

1437
01:05:27.333 --> 01:05:28.871
You had a meeting
with Thorenson.

1438
01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:30.246
that's why you bailed on me.

1439
01:05:30.342 --> 01:05:32.551
No. no. I didn't bail on you.
I have a job.

1440
01:05:32.647 --> 01:05:33.735
Oh. it's your job now.

1441
01:05:34.405 --> 01:05:37.862
I thought your job was to get
enough dirt on the asshole

1442
01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:40.102
so that you could put
him out of business.

1443
01:05:40.199 --> 01:05:41.382
Yeah. it is.

1444
01:05:42.151 --> 01:05:45.031
Is that why you smell like
cheap whores and stale beer?

1445
01:05:45.734 --> 01:05:46.822
Or is it the other way around?

1446
01:05:46.919 --> 01:05:48.549
I am so close to
nailing him. all right?

1447
01:05:48.646 --> 01:05:49.638
Why did you save him?

1448
01:05:49.734 --> 01:05:51.429
If you wanted
to get rid of him--

1449
01:05:51.526 --> 01:05:52.775
I saved him to save you. OK?

1450
01:05:52.871 --> 01:05:54.599
Who knows how many people
that guy would've shot.

1451
01:05:54.695 --> 01:05:55.782
Apparently you.

1452
01:05:58.727 --> 01:06:00.006
I'm building a case.

1453
01:06:00.102 --> 01:06:02.246
OK? Listen to me.
in four months.

this all explodes at his
annual investor's meeting.

1455

Four months?

1456
01:06:06.119 --> 01:06:08.487
Franklin. this is not about
your sister or the world.

1457
01:06:08.582 --> 01:06:11.782
This is about you and
power and all this shit.

1458
01:06:11.879 --> 01:06:14.406
I think you like
taking his money.

1459
01:06:14.502 --> 01:06:16.389
His money paid
for your art show.

1460
01:06:16.486 --> 01:06:18.727
I knew you would hold
that over my head.

1461
01:06:18.822 --> 01:06:20.486
You say you don't care about
the money. but you do. Jala.

1462
01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.118
Leave me alone.
That makes you a hypocrite.

1463
01:06:22.214 --> 01:06:23.718
I'm a hypocrite?
Yeah. it makes you a hypocrite.

1464
01:06:23.815 --> 01:06:24.743
I'm a hypocrite?
Yes.

What was that?

1472
01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:47.206
You were touching me.
No. no. no. no. no.

we were out there in the water.

get in the water?

I was in there. I saw it.

1481
01:07:06.087 --> 01:07:07.782
I. I found it.

1482
01:07:08.999 --> 01:07:10.375
And it does that?

1483
01:07:10.471 --> 01:07:13.575
Yeah. yeah. it takes you
back in time 57 seconds.

No. no. no. no. no.

I can show you a--

No. don't do it again.
Don't ever do it again.

going fuckin' crazy. [sniffles]

Where did you get it?

1490

I found it on stage the
night that I saved Burrell.

1491

But I don't know
where it came from.

1492

The night we met?

1494
01:07:34.149 --> 01:07:35.591
So you've had it
this whole time?

1495
01:07:36.711 --> 01:07:38.759
How many times
have you done that?

1496
01:07:38.853 --> 01:07:40.455
And why can't I remember?

1497
01:07:41.447 --> 01:07:42.789
I mean. I don't know.

1498
01:07:42.886 --> 01:07:45.383
I guess you only remember
if you're like touching it.

1499
01:07:45.479 --> 01:07:47.047
and if not.
it just. just resets.

1500
01:07:47.142 --> 01:07:50.406
Do you use it to do
things. to get stuff. like...?

1501
01:07:52.231 --> 01:07:53.575
That's it. isn't it?

1502

all this. all this shit.

Did you use it with me?

1505

Is that how you got me?

1506
01:08:04.006 --> 01:08:06.886

say what I want to hear?

1507

This ring gave us
everything. OK?

Our whole life
is a lie. Franklin.

It's not a lie. 'cause
when you press it.

It happened and you know it.

It happened.
you know it. I forget it.

gone with my gut from the start.

Calvert?
[alarm chirping]

1748
01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:24.839
We're good. right?
Might have done some damage.

1749
01:19:24.935 --> 01:19:26.726
We should get back
on the ground.

1750
01:19:26.823 --> 01:19:29.287
No. no. no.
We fly. dammit.

1752
01:19:33.446 --> 01:19:35.366
Calvert's right.
let's turn back.

1753
01:19:35.463 --> 01:19:37.543
Personally. I'd
rather fight my case

1754
01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:38.950
from a private island
than a cell.

1755
01:19:39.047 --> 01:19:41.159
Gotta at least get
across the border.

1756
01:19:42.086 --> 01:19:44.614
This is all your fault.
you know that. right?

1757
01:19:45.767 --> 01:19:47.815
Hey. I am talking to you.

[electronic whirring

1759
01:19:55.912 --> 01:19:57.446
What the hell?

1760
01:19:59.784 --> 01:20:00.872
That ring?

1761
01:20:00.967 --> 01:20:02.983
That's it. that's what
you've been doing.

1762
01:20:03.079 --> 01:20:05.126
The ring? Sig. what
are you talking about?

1763
01:20:05.223 --> 01:20:07.719
I was here. then you.
you were...

1764
01:20:08.392 --> 01:20:09.448
Give me that ring!

1765

01:20:16.872 --> 01:20:17.736
Please.

01:20:23.271 --> 01:20:25.894
Strap in!
You give it to me.

1771
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:28.007
Give it to me. asshole.
We're going down.

1772
01:20:28.103 --> 01:20:30.248
Don't you wanna see
your girl again?

1773
01:20:31.176 --> 01:20:32.488
[electronic whirring

1774
01:20:32.583 --> 01:20:34.630
The ring? Sig. what
are you talking about?

1775
01:20:34.727 --> 01:20:37.128
Explosion.
The ring. it takes it back.

1776
01:20:37.224 --> 01:20:38.407
What explosion?
She doesn't know.

1777
01:20:38.503 --> 01:20:40.232
But you do. you know.

1778
01:20:40.327 --> 01:20:41.768
You know.

1779
01:20:41.863 --> 01:20:42.728
I do.

1780
01:20:42.823 --> 01:20:44.167
[Sig] Give it to me.

1781
01:20:44.263 --> 01:20:46.375
That's it. it's too late.

1782
01:20:46.472 --> 01:20:48.199
There's not enough time.
Here. you can take it.

1783
01:20:48.295 --> 01:20:49.894
What do you mean
not enough time?

1784
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:51.432
The ring only goes
back 57 seconds.

1785
01:20:51.528 --> 01:20:53.126
Then I'll just take us back.

1786
01:20:53.959 --> 01:20:55.592
Take us back. take us back.

1787
01:20:55.687 --> 01:20:56.614
It's not working.

1788
01:20:56.710 --> 01:20:58.599

Here. here.

1792
01:21:06.183 --> 01:21:08.391
Make it. make it
work. make it work.

1793
01:21:08.486 --> 01:21:10.247
I told you when we first met.

1794
01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:11.656
It has limited power.

1795
01:21:11.752 --> 01:21:13.286
[Renee] What is
he talking about?

1796
01:21:13.384 --> 01:21:14.887
That's it.
it's over. you're done.

1797
01:21:14.983 --> 01:21:16.296
If I'm done. you're done.
You wanna die?

1798
01:21:16.392 --> 01:21:18.823
Your pills. your company.
You killed my sister.

1799
01:21:18.919 --> 01:21:20.232
You don't deserve
anything you've got.

1800
01:21:20.328 --> 01:21:21.799
[Renee sobbing]

1801
01:21:21.895 --> 01:21:24.775
So if you die. I. I don't care.

1802
01:21:25.256 --> 01:21:27.239
[Renee] Sig!
Pull up.

1803
01:21:27.334 --> 01:21:28.168
Pull up.

1804
01:21:28.263 --> 01:21:29.159
[alarms blaring]

1805
01:21:29.254 --> 01:21:30.728

stay inside the vehicle.

1810
01:22:10.216 --> 01:22:12.264
Ma'am. ma'am. do not
approach the crash site.

1811
01:22:12.359 --> 01:22:13.479
[Jala] Franklin?

1812
01:22:13.575 --> 01:22:14.952
[officer] Ma'am. get back!

1813

1814
01:22:16.615 --> 01:22:17.254
Franklin?

1815
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:18.567
Franklin!

[Calvert coughing]

1817
01:22:20.552 --> 01:22:22.504
Where's Franklin.
where's Franklin?

1818
01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.719
[Calvert] I don't know.

1825
01:22:38.023 --> 01:22:38.952

[sirens wailing]

1835
01:23:14.184 --> 01:23:16.232
Hey. you want me to
look at that for you?

1836
01:23:16.328 --> 01:23:17.544
[Anton] He'll be OK.

1837
01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:19.559
[Jala] Franklin. what
is he doing here?

1838
01:23:19.654 --> 01:23:20.839
And how do you know he'll be OK?

1839
01:23:20.936 --> 01:23:23.590
Ingram's circuitry
integrates with the ring.

1840
01:23:23.687 --> 01:23:25.032
[Franklin] The ring.

1841
01:23:25.128 --> 01:23:26.760
You. you knew I had the ring?

1842
01:23:28.936 --> 01:23:31.848
Sorry. I. I should have
given it back to you.

1843
01:23:31.944 --> 01:23:33.736
Well. I wanted you to have it.

1844
01:23:33.832 --> 01:23:35.271
[stammers]

1845
01:23:36.648 --> 01:23:37.576
Why?

1846
01:23:37.672 --> 01:23:38.887
The moment you picked it up.

1847
01:23:38.983 --> 01:23:40.071
Ingram determined that you

1848
01:23:40.167 --> 01:23:42.280
could be the perfect person to--

1849
01:23:42.376 --> 01:23:43.464
To test it on?

1850
01:23:43.559 --> 01:23:45.192
I wasn't testing the ring.

1851
01:23:45.288 --> 01:23:46.439
I was testing you.

1852
01:23:46.534 --> 01:23:48.550
Monitoring you to see

1853
01:23:48.647 --> 01:23:51.495
how technology
would affect your...

1854
01:23:52.294 --> 01:23:53.672
decisions. actions.

1855
01:23:54.823 --> 01:23:56.295
Quantum crystals.

1856
01:23:56.391 --> 01:23:59.688
The crystals put me on the
path to develop the Tri-Bands.

1857
01:24:00.872 --> 01:24:02.823
But the real breakthrough...
Time travel.

1858
01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:05.320
Franklin.

1859
01:24:06.024 --> 01:24:08.679
I've been looking for
someone with the aptitude

1860
01:24:08.775 --> 01:24:10.791
to work alongside me

1861
01:24:10.887 --> 01:24:13.128
to determine how best to use

1862
01:24:13.224 --> 01:24:17.192
the vast potentials of this
technology for the world.

1863
01:24:17.287 --> 01:24:19.783
So I'm asking you
to come on board.

1864
01:24:19.879 --> 01:24:21.416
Help me discover it.

1865
01:24:23.784 --> 01:24:24.999
You can't.

1866
01:24:25.095 --> 01:24:26.919
you can't just
keep going back and...

1867
01:24:27.719 --> 01:24:29.416
redoing things till
you get it right.

1868
01:24:30.888 --> 01:24:33.000
Is that what a better
future looks like?

1869
01:24:34.344 --> 01:24:35.208
Death?

1870
01:24:36.359 --> 01:24:39.367
You're not about to
mourn Sig Thorenson.

1871
01:24:40.136 --> 01:24:41.319
No.

1872
01:24:41.415 --> 01:24:43.239
But innocent people
could have died.

1873
01:24:44.039 --> 01:24:45.703
Jala could have
been on that plane.

1874
01:24:46.344 --> 01:24:47.974
So you're turning me down.

1875
01:24:50.728 --> 01:24:52.488
Well. in that case.
I need the ring.

1876
01:24:52.584 --> 01:24:53.991
[ominous music]

1877
01:24:54.087 --> 01:24:54.951
No.

1878
01:24:56.583 --> 01:24:59.623
This thing is.
this thing's dangerous.

1879
01:25:00.616 --> 01:25:02.216
It's addictive. it's like...

1880
01:25:02.312 --> 01:25:04.327
the same stuff
that killed my sister.

1881
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:08.520
I couldn't stop using it
and I didn't want to.

1882
01:25:12.648 --> 01:25:14.184
[ring drops in grass]

1883
01:25:15.048 --> 01:25:16.968
Now wait. Franklin. wait.

1884
01:25:17.064 --> 01:25:18.984
Sorry. I gotta end this.

1890
01:25:36.456 --> 01:25:37.704
Should we run?

1891
01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.111
I can't run. you run.

1892
01:25:39.207 --> 01:25:41.192
No. I told you
I'm not leaving you.

1893
01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:50.952
Offer still stands.

1894
01:25:53.287 --> 01:25:54.408
What?
You just proved

1895
01:25:54.504 --> 01:25:56.968
that you are the
perfect partner.

1896
01:25:57.063 --> 01:25:59.336
You. you already
have a partner.

1897

He analyzes.
does what he's told.

1898
01:26:02.344 --> 01:26:04.488
Last thing I need
is a yes man.

1899
01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.168
I need somebody who's
not afraid to tell me no.

1900
01:26:09.384 --> 01:26:10.760
Now what do you say?

1901
01:26:11.847 --> 01:26:13.832
Will you help me
make a better world?

1902
01:26:17.704 --> 01:26:18.823
I just did.

1903
01:26:19.527 --> 01:26:20.808
You can have these back too.

You have a lot of
explaining to do.

1907
01:26:34.791 --> 01:26:35.976
