00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.275
All right. thank you.

4
00:00:32.814 --> 00:00:35.651
Hi. how are you. beautiful?

5
00:00:35.684 --> 00:00:37.753
There you go. hot and waiting
for you.

6
00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:38.586
Thank you so much.

7
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.622
- Good night.
- Thank you.

8
00:00:39.654 --> 00:00:40.822
Good night.

9
00:00:40.855 --> 00:00:42.957
All right. let's shut it down.
huh?

10
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:44.594
Oh good. going home.

11
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:49.097
Okay. motherfuckers. let's go!

12
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:52.101
Give me what I want or I'll
give you what you don't want.

13
00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:55.237
Give the money right
now. you wop. let's go.

14
00:00:57.772 --> 00:00:58.641
Hurry up!

15
00:01:01.342 --> 00:01:03.144
Okay. okay. please.

16
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.315
Hurry up. give it to me.

17
00:01:06.348 --> 00:01:09.117
All right. all right.
you got what you came for.

18
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.819
Leave.

19
00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:12.354
What the fuck you looking at?

20
00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:15.324
That's not all the money.

21
00:01:15.357 --> 00:01:18.861
What the fuck you said?

22
00:01:18.893 --> 00:01:19.994
That's not all the money.

23
00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:21.997
The old wop got a safe in the
back.

24
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:28.870
You heard the little nigger.
let's go.

25
00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:29.771
Okay. okay.

26
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.976
What the fuck you waiting on.
let's go.

27
00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:36.411
This shit is not a game.

28
00:01:36.444 --> 00:01:37.245
Get out my way!

29
00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:38.214
Little nigger. where is the
safe?

30
00:01:38.247 --> 00:01:40.114
Second bottom drawer
of the file cabinet.

31
00:01:40.147 --> 00:01:42.784
Jump to it. motherfucker.
let's go.

32
00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:43.819
Okay. okay.

33
00:01:43.852 --> 00:01:46.188
Get the money. cracker nigger!

34
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:47.222
I will kill your woman.

35
00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:48.857
Just give him the money!

36
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.326
Hurry the fuck up and get my
money!

37
00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:54.328
Put the money in the bag. all of
it.

38
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:57.098
God. I hate to rob you. my
niggas. yes.

39
00:01:57.131 --> 00:01:57.965
Let's go!

40
00:01:57.998 --> 00:01:58.833
Hurry. Roberto!

41
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:01.736
Nigger. today. listen to your
bitch.

42
00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:03.137
I got shit to do.

43
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.238
Give me my fucking money.

44
00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:05.740
Any more money left?

45
00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:19.888
This is one nice fucking
piece.

46
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:23.257
Like my wife. almost too
fucking pretty to shoot.

47
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:25.928
I'll tell you what. I'll
take the lot of them.

48
00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:28.831
Go see Frankie in the back.
he'll set you straight.

49
00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:31.099
Whoa. whoa. whoa. where you
going. heh?

50
00:02:31.132 --> 00:02:33.000
Come on. I open up the joint in
an hour.

51
00:02:33.034 --> 00:02:35.237
You think I want my
customers to look at these?

52
00:02:36.872 --> 00:02:38.339
Hey. hey. hey!

53
00:02:38.373 --> 00:02:40.274
There he is. this is him.

54
00:02:40.308 --> 00:02:42.745
Look who's here. the man of
the hour.

55
00:02:42.778 --> 00:02:44.179
How you doing. kid?

56
00:02:44.212 --> 00:02:45.214
What's your name?

57
00:02:45.247 --> 00:02:46.348
Bernard James.

58
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.248
Bernard. heh?

59
00:02:48.116 --> 00:02:51.086
I tell you the truth. I
appreciate what you did. kid.

60
00:02:51.118 --> 00:02:53.955
But the truth be told. if
you didn't open your mouth

61
00:02:53.988 --> 00:02:56.759
about the safe. we wouldn't
be here in the first place.

62
00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:58.993
What the fuck were you thinking
about.

63
00:02:59.027 --> 00:03:02.498
jeopardizing my fucking money
for fucking pizza money?

64
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.467
Roberto gave me a job to
help take care of my mom.

65
00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.002
I like Roberto. he's a good man.

66
00:03:11.273 --> 00:03:12.441
I like you. kid.

67
00:03:12.474 --> 00:03:14.443
I like a kid who stands up for
his friends

68
00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:16.110
and takes care of his mother.

69
00:03:16.143 --> 00:03:17.445
You're good in my book.

70
00:03:18.146 --> 00:03:22.551
But one thing I'm not too crazy
about is your name. Bernard.

71
00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:25.987
I don't know. you don't
look like a Bernard.

72
00:03:27.388 --> 00:03:28.491
What do I look like?

73
00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:32.327
There was a guy I
come up with years ago.

74
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.129
he didn't take shit from nobody.

75
00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:36.464
He saved my life once. God rest
his soul.

76
00:03:36.498 --> 00:03:39.167
He had fucking steel balls just
like you.

77
00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:42.171
His name was Dutch.

78
00:03:42.203 --> 00:03:43.772
How about we call you Dutch?

79
00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.876
Dutch. yeah. it'd be
an honor. Mr. Cerrone.

80
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.446
All right. Roberto. hook
him up with the chop shop

81
00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.513
in North Newark. all right.

82
00:03:52.547 --> 00:03:53.448
All right.

83
00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:55.516
Let the kid start earning for
a living.

84
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.517
You hungry. kid?

85
00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:58.921
I got a guy in the back
fix you a fucking plate

86
00:03:58.953 --> 00:04:01.422
of spaghetti make your hair
curl.

87
00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:21.168
Have them bring my usual.

88
00:05:21.201 --> 00:05:22.470
I'll be at my table in a few
minutes.

89
00:05:22.504 --> 00:05:24.672
Sure. Miss Nichols.

90
00:06:07.381 --> 00:06:09.518
Excuse me. but you're
at the wrong table.

91
00:06:10.549 --> 00:06:11.252
Not if you're Michelle
Nichols.

92
00:06:12.153 --> 00:06:13.121
Food is important to me.

93
00:06:13.153 --> 00:06:14.622
I don't like being
interrupted while eating.

94
00:06:14.655 --> 00:06:16.490
Make an appointment and
see me at my office.

95
00:06:16.523 --> 00:06:18.025
Well. it's kind of an urgent
matter.

96
00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:19.261
They all are.

97
00:06:20.362 --> 00:06:21.263
Bernard James.

98
00:06:22.263 --> 00:06:23.131
Dutch.

99
00:06:23.163 --> 00:06:24.031
Nice to meet you.

100
00:06:24.064 --> 00:06:25.466
You're a drug dealer.

101
00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:27.302
Does that scare you?

102
00:06:27.335 --> 00:06:29.137
I'm a criminal defense
attorney. Mr. James.

103
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.372
very little scares me.

104
00:06:31.638 --> 00:06:33.542
This is a certified check.

105
00:06:33.574 --> 00:06:35.977
You're incredibly naive if
you think you're the only rich

106
00:06:36.011 --> 00:06:38.679
drug dealer in New Jersey who
needs my services. Mr. James.

107
00:06:38.713 --> 00:06:41.482
Ms. Nichols. I'm not being
arrested for selling narcotics.

108
00:06:41.516 --> 00:06:42.684
What are you being arrested
for?

109
00:06:42.716 --> 00:06:43.551
Being black.

110
00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:44.419
That's not a crime.

111
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:45.687
Who's being naive now?

112
00:06:47.521 --> 00:06:50.091
Black men are incarcerated six
times the rate of white males

113
00:06:50.124 --> 00:06:51.360
if they're not killed first.

114
00:06:51.393 --> 00:06:54.029
That's your defense because
white people get away with it.

115
00:06:54.062 --> 00:06:54.963
you should too?

116
00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.232
Oh. if you think it'll work.
I'm game.

117
00:07:00.268 --> 00:07:01.670
I appreciate the offer. Mr.
James.

118
00:07:01.703 --> 00:07:03.638
but I don't think I can
represent you.

119
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.872
Any particular reason why not?

120
00:07:04.905 --> 00:07:08.242
No. but you haven't given
me a good reason why I should.

121
00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:09.543
Well. Johnny Cochran wasn't
available.

122
00:07:09.576 --> 00:07:11.245
And you're not very funny.

123
00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:14.348
Oh. no disrespect to Johnny
Cochran. God rest his soul.

124
00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:16.650
I meant it as a testament
of your legal skill.

125
00:07:16.684 --> 00:07:17.785
The system is corrupt.

126
00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:19.321
I just happen to care a little
bit more

127
00:07:19.353 --> 00:07:21.789
than the people who work in the
system.

128
00:07:21.823 --> 00:07:24.559
Oh. I think it's a
little bit more than that.

129
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:25.693
You're a true believer.

130
00:07:29.797 --> 00:07:32.566
People of color are incapable
of receiving equality

131
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.369
of justice in the
American judicial system.

132
00:07:35.403 --> 00:07:36.271
Sound familiar?

133
00:07:37.638 --> 00:07:39.441
Fundamental principles
of the Sixth Amendment

134
00:07:39.473 --> 00:07:42.576
are systematically undermined
by racism. economic disparity

135
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.013
and political oppression.

136
00:07:45.246 --> 00:07:46.615
Are these your words?

137
00:07:46.648 --> 00:07:48.383
How'd you get that?

138
00:07:48.415 --> 00:07:50.384
It's good. it's better than
good.

139
00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:52.386
I know what it is. I wrote
it second year Harvard Law.

140
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.489
what's your point?

141
00:07:54.489 --> 00:07:56.590
We both believe in justice.

142
00:07:56.624 --> 00:07:58.727
Now. I've been to prison. Ms.
Nichols.

143
00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:01.495
It's not a pleasant place
and I'm never going back.

144
00:08:01.528 --> 00:08:03.432
If I can't get a fair
trial with you in court.

145
00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:05.434
I'll hold court on the streets.

146
00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:06.367
That would be suicide.

147
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.037
No. it would be self defense.

148
00:08:09.603 --> 00:08:11.672
What exactly are you being
charged with?

149
00:08:13.607 --> 00:08:15.376
I think they'll know better
than me.

150
00:08:27.722 --> 00:08:30.192
Bernard James.
you're under arrest.

151
00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:32.261
Cuff him.

152
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.532
He better look as good as he
does now

153
00:08:38.565 --> 00:08:39.867
after he gets to booking.

154
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.303
Who the hell are you?

155
00:08:41.335 --> 00:08:43.671
Michelle Nichols. his
attorney.

156
00:09:00.788 --> 00:09:03.291
Good morning. you're
watching Wake Up New Jersey.

157
00:09:03.324 --> 00:09:05.327
I'm David Greenwood. we're
glad you could be here.

158
00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:07.761
Let's get right to the top
story of the day. shall we?

159
00:09:07.795 --> 00:09:10.899
It has now been six months
since alleged drug dealer.

160
00:09:10.931 --> 00:09:14.168
Bernard Dutch James was arrested
at a New Jersey restaurant.

161
00:09:14.202 --> 00:09:16.505
Now. ironically. Mr.
James was not picked up

162
00:09:16.538 --> 00:09:18.206
for a drug-related offense.

163
00:09:18.238 --> 00:09:20.742
rather this is more serious than
that.

164
00:09:20.775 --> 00:09:23.511
He's been charged with
orchestrating the mass bombing

165
00:09:23.545 --> 00:09:26.147
of a New Jersey police
station that led to the deaths

166
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.417
of 27 good officers and the
wounding of scores more.

167
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.387
It's an act many are calling
terrorism.

168
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.491
Now. Bernard James has always
denied these accusations

169
00:09:36.524 --> 00:09:39.528
through his attorney. Michelle
Nichols. who just so happens

170
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.896
to be our guest on the program
today.

171
00:09:41.929 --> 00:09:43.098
Thank you for
having me.

172
00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:45.766
Now. I gotta say. Michelle.
when our viewers found out

173
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.270
that you were gonna be on the
program.

174
00:09:48.303 --> 00:09:50.804
our social media pages basically
shut down

175
00:09:50.838 --> 00:09:53.675
with the sheer amount of
comments people were leaving.

176
00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:54.642
Well. I don't
know if that's good or bad.

177
00:09:54.675 --> 00:09:56.645
Well. I've
been going through a lot

178
00:09:56.678 --> 00:09:59.780
of these comments and many of
them are less than flattering

179
00:09:59.814 --> 00:10:01.616
towards you and your client.

180
00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:03.684
And a good number of
them aren't even suitable

181
00:10:03.718 --> 00:10:05.886
to air on television.

182
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.755
Does that worry you?

183
00:10:06.788 --> 00:10:08.924
You know what worries me

184
00:10:08.957 --> 00:10:11.359
and it should worry your
audience. too?

185
00:10:11.391 --> 00:10:13.862
The Constitution mandates that
everyone should be afforded

186
00:10:13.895 --> 00:10:16.731
a good and capable defense. not
just...

187
00:10:16.764 --> 00:10:18.433
Yo. turn this up.

188
00:10:19.132 --> 00:10:21.636
People get caught up in the
sound bytes on the internet

189
00:10:21.669 --> 00:10:23.237
and suddenly volunteer

190
00:10:23.271 --> 00:10:24.905
to abandon their Constitutional
rights

191
00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:27.742
because they're not aware of the
facts.

192
00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:28.610
Well. here we go.

193
00:10:28.642 --> 00:10:30.411
What are the facts?

194
00:10:30.444 --> 00:10:32.314
Anthony Jacobs
knows that William Brent

195
00:10:32.347 --> 00:10:35.917
is responsible for this
heinous crime. yet he insists

196
00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:39.220
on using the powers of the
district attorney's office

197
00:10:39.253 --> 00:10:40.454
to persecute Mr. James.

198
00:10:40.488 --> 00:10:43.857
But District Attorney Anthony
Jacobs believes your client

199
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:46.227
is complicit with the
actions of William Brent.

200
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:47.462
Well. you know what?

201
00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:50.298
I believe I can fly. but the
judicial system doesn't operate

202
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.232
on what we believe.

203
00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:52.534
It's about what you can prove.

204
00:10:52.567 --> 00:10:54.703
And there is no evidence
of any malfeasance

205
00:10:54.736 --> 00:10:57.271
or of culpable intent by Mr.
James.

206
00:10:57.304 --> 00:10:58.640
You do need evidence.

207
00:10:58.673 --> 00:11:00.708
Just because a person has been
arrested.

208
00:11:00.742 --> 00:11:03.245
you can't automatically
conclude they're guilty.

209
00:11:06.747 --> 00:11:08.650
Documents were sent over.

210
00:11:08.683 --> 00:11:09.718
When did this happen?

211
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:11.386
We're going in right now.
I gotta call you back.

212
00:11:11.419 --> 00:11:13.554
Michelle Nichols. saw you on
TV.

213
00:11:13.588 --> 00:11:14.655
You did an amazing job.

214
00:11:14.689 --> 00:11:15.957
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

215
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.859
We want the Wake Up New Jersey
piece

216
00:11:17.891 --> 00:11:20.462
on all social media sites
and local news outlets.

217
00:11:22.396 --> 00:11:24.898
Wait. I gotta call you back.

218
00:11:27.501 --> 00:11:29.972
All rise for the
honorable Judge Whitaker.

219
00:11:37.745 --> 00:11:39.614
You may be seated.

220
00:11:39.646 --> 00:11:41.249
Bring in the jury.

221
00:11:49.089 --> 00:11:52.493
Is the state ready to proceed
with its opening statement?

222
00:11:52.526 --> 00:11:56.730
Hello. I am District
Attorney Anthony Jacobs

223
00:11:56.764 --> 00:12:01.503
and I wanna thank you for
your attendance today.

224
00:12:02.536 --> 00:12:06.440
I know some of you may deem
my gratitude unwarranted

225
00:12:06.473 --> 00:12:10.045
because let's be honest. if
you didn't have to be here.

226
00:12:10.078 --> 00:12:12.814
you probably wouldn't come.
right?

227
00:12:12.847 --> 00:12:13.715
And I agree.

228
00:12:14.649 --> 00:12:16.017
I'd much rather be playing golf

229
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.453
or going to my child's piano
recital

230
00:12:18.486 --> 00:12:20.655
or just enjoying a quiet day at
home.

231
00:12:21.622 --> 00:12:26.828
But I can't 'cause this is my
duty. just like it's your duty

232
00:12:27.093 --> 00:12:30.332
to assure your fellow
citizens will remain safe.

233
00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:33.934
just as it is the police to
do the same for you and I.

234
00:12:33.968 --> 00:12:35.036
our civic duty.

235
00:12:36.838 --> 00:12:38.073
But above and beyond our civic
duty.

236
00:12:38.106 --> 00:12:41.976
above and beyond the inconvenience
duty sometimes imposes

237
00:12:42.008 --> 00:12:45.579
on the dutiful. therefore it is
our right.

238
00:12:45.612 --> 00:12:48.049
It is your right to be safe in
your home.

239
00:12:48.082 --> 00:12:50.552
It is your right to
oversee the justice system

240
00:12:50.584 --> 00:12:53.054
and it is your right to
be heard as citizens.

241
00:12:54.454 --> 00:12:56.891
even if the uncivilized play
mockery

242
00:12:56.924 --> 00:12:58.492
with our sense of security.

243
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.429
Now. we're all God-fearing
human beings and those of you

244
00:13:02.463 --> 00:13:04.565
who aren't. well. you wouldn't
be here

245
00:13:04.598 --> 00:13:06.100
if you didn't recognize the law.

246
00:13:07.934 --> 00:13:10.070
And you certainly
wouldn't be sitting there

247
00:13:10.103 --> 00:13:13.007
if you didn't know the difference
between right and wrong.

248
00:13:14.809 --> 00:13:18.146
So I say to you. what if
I could present to you

249
00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:21.415
the very embodiment of wrong?

250
00:13:22.382 --> 00:13:25.552
Would you hesitate to
look wrong in the face?

251
00:13:25.585 --> 00:13:28.055
Would you banish wrong from our
society?

252
00:13:28.088 --> 00:13:29.491
Would you turn away from guilt

253
00:13:29.524 --> 00:13:32.694
if it was staring you right in
the face?

254
00:13:32.727 --> 00:13:34.596
Well. I'm gonna give you that
chance.

255
00:13:35.362 --> 00:13:38.098
Because I'm gonna prove
beyond any reasonable doubt

256
00:13:38.131 --> 00:13:42.971
that Bernard James is the
embodiment of this city's wrong.

257
00:13:43.003 --> 00:13:46.640
He is the root cause of fear
that is prevalent in this city

258
00:13:46.674 --> 00:13:50.578
and the degradation of our civil
order.

259
00:13:50.611 --> 00:13:54.049
It all stems from the
actions of this one man.

260
00:13:54.982 --> 00:14:00.388
Bernard James is an
instigator. an agitator

261
00:14:00.988 --> 00:14:02.089
and head of the organized crime

262
00:14:02.123 --> 00:14:05.893
that has terrorized New
Jersey for the past 12 years.

263
00:14:05.926 --> 00:14:09.663
You have a chance to look evil
in the face and in the name

264
00:14:09.697 --> 00:14:13.602
of the state of New Jersey.
you say one word. guilty.

265
00:14:27.548 --> 00:14:28.417
Thank you.

266
00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:33.021
As the day is drawing long.
we'll continue these proceedings

267
00:14:33.054 --> 00:14:35.088
tomorrow morning at 9 AM.

268
00:14:35.122 --> 00:14:35.957
Your honor.

269
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.058
Thank you. Ms. Nichols.

270
00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:38.193
Relax.

271
00:14:38.226 --> 00:14:40.128
Court is now
adjourned.

272
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.261
And let Jacobs'
statement be the last thing

273
00:14:41.295 --> 00:14:43.665
the jury remembers before
they go to sleep tonight?

274
00:14:43.698 --> 00:14:45.634
Don't worry about it.

275
00:14:51.238 --> 00:14:52.973
Hi. this is Lady
D.

276
00:14:53.006 --> 00:14:55.609
I'm not available to
take your call right now.

277
00:14:55.642 --> 00:14:58.579
Please leave a message at the
tone.

278
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.703
Dutch had assembled
a young team of raiders

279
00:15:22.737 --> 00:15:25.506
from all over New York
to steal cars as a kid.

280
00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.674
And he was arrested and sent

281
00:15:26.707 --> 00:15:28.242
to Mountain View Correctional
Facility

282
00:15:28.275 --> 00:15:31.112
for trying to steal a
dozen BMWs at the port.

283
00:15:31.145 --> 00:15:33.114
BMWs?

284
00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:49.864
Y'all wanna make this shit
interesting?

285
00:15:49.897 --> 00:15:53.233
Shit. shooting motherfuckers.
that'll make it interesting.

286
00:15:53.266 --> 00:15:56.136
Shit. that's your answer for
everything.

287
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.872
What's better than that.
Angel?

288
00:15:57.905 --> 00:15:59.006
Money.

289
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.041
What you thinking. Dutch?

290
00:16:01.074 --> 00:16:03.310
I'm thinking whoever
has the fastest time.

291
00:16:03.343 --> 00:16:05.679
the other three throw them a G
apiece.

292
00:16:05.713 --> 00:16:09.217
Ooh. extra three grand. I'm
in.

293
00:16:12.185 --> 00:16:14.321
All right then. let's do it.

294
00:16:40.314 --> 00:16:41.849
You wanna roll?

295
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.909
Share.

296
00:17:08.943 --> 00:17:09.944
Yes. sir.

297
00:17:09.976 --> 00:17:11.845
Everybody give Angel her
share.

298
00:17:11.878 --> 00:17:12.646
She did that.

299
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.882
Whoa. whoa. whoa. wait a
minute.

300
00:17:14.915 --> 00:17:17.318
Y'all know I was way faster than
Angel.

301
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.386
Yeah. you would've been

302
00:17:18.418 --> 00:17:20.954
if you didn't waste time
picking up random bitches.

303
00:17:20.988 --> 00:17:21.856
Man. whatever.

304
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.792
Hey. look. I ain't even
mad at you. man. 'cause look.

305
00:17:24.825 --> 00:17:26.995
I see what it got you. playboy.

306
00:17:27.028 --> 00:17:29.130
I ain't mad at you. go ahead.

307
00:17:29.163 --> 00:17:30.198
Here. take your little money.

308
00:17:30.231 --> 00:17:30.898
Yeah. come over here.

309
00:17:30.932 --> 00:17:32.099
I got you. you know I got you.

310
00:17:32.133 --> 00:17:32.967
I ain't tripping about that.

311
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.368
Mine is in there.

312
00:17:34.402 --> 00:17:36.136
Whatever they want. it's on
me.

313
00:17:38.305 --> 00:17:39.841
Roberto. man.

314
00:17:39.874 --> 00:17:40.842
How you doing. kid?

315
00:17:40.875 --> 00:17:41.675
- Good. you?
- Good.

316
00:17:41.709 --> 00:17:42.777
You remember Qwan. Angel and
Craze.

317
00:17:42.809 --> 00:17:44.111
Hey. how are y'all doing?

318
00:17:44.145 --> 00:17:47.181
Oh man. we doing real good.

319
00:17:47.213 --> 00:17:49.082
You got a minute. I need to
talk to you.

320
00:17:49.116 --> 00:17:51.685
Yeah. whatever you want.

321
00:17:51.719 --> 00:17:52.886
Get something to drink. man.

322
00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:53.854
Hey. bartender.

323
00:17:53.887 --> 00:17:54.722
$100 to the bartender.

324
00:17:54.754 --> 00:17:56.924
So what's going on?

325
00:17:56.956 --> 00:17:59.326
Fat Tony wanted me to talk to
you.

326
00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:00.261
What. we do something wrong?

327
00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:02.229
Nah. no. no not at all.

328
00:18:02.262 --> 00:18:03.897
I think you been doing a great
job.

329
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:05.967
In fact. they wanted me to give
you this.

330
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:11.872
Damn. I don't even know
what to say. but thank you.

331
00:18:11.905 --> 00:18:13.308
And there's more. all right.

332
00:18:16.911 --> 00:18:18.379
He's taking you out of the car
business

333
00:18:18.412 --> 00:18:20.014
and putting you into narcotics.

334
00:18:20.047 --> 00:18:20.848
Man. what you mean he wanna
take us out

335
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.815
of the car business?

336
00:18:21.848 --> 00:18:23.684
No. no. no. it's a
good thing. all right.

337
00:18:23.717 --> 00:18:26.286
With your street connections.
it just makes sense.

338
00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:28.056
You're gonna be working under
Frank.

339
00:18:28.088 --> 00:18:29.823
You're gonna be making 10 times
the money

340
00:18:29.857 --> 00:18:31.358
and have 10 times the
responsibility.

341
00:18:31.392 --> 00:18:33.261
You think you can handle that?

342
00:18:33.293 --> 00:18:36.363
Man. they haven't invented
a hustle I can't handle.

343
00:18:36.396 --> 00:18:37.732
But what about my team?

344
00:18:37.764 --> 00:18:38.732
Yeah. hire whoever you want.

345
00:18:38.765 --> 00:18:40.467
There's enough money to
go around for everybody.

346
00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:44.405
but if they shit on you.
that's your problem.

347
00:18:44.437 --> 00:18:47.841
If they shit on us.
that's your problem. too.

348
00:18:50.444 --> 00:18:53.280
And Frank is okay with that?

349
00:18:53.313 --> 00:18:55.082
Comes from Fat Tony.

350
00:18:55.116 --> 00:18:57.251
Frank doesn't have a choice
in the matter. all right.

351
00:18:57.283 --> 00:18:59.486
But there's this guy.

352
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.490
He's got a 1956 Bel Air
Coupe. a real beauty.

353
00:19:02.522 --> 00:19:03.890
Frank tried to buy it from the
guy.

354
00:19:03.924 --> 00:19:05.193
but the guy wouldn't budge.

355
00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:10.364
It would go a long way to
smooth things out with Frank

356
00:19:10.396 --> 00:19:12.300
if you could get him that car.

357
00:19:13.067 --> 00:19:14.902
You just tell me where
it's at and it's yours.

358
00:19:14.934 --> 00:19:17.739
According to Frank. the
guy goes to Joe's Steakhouse

359
00:19:17.771 --> 00:19:22.711
every day at 7 like clockwork.
parks with the valet.

360
00:19:24.411 --> 00:19:25.914
You can consider it done.

361
00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:28.883
Congratulations.

362
00:19:28.915 --> 00:19:30.751
You've come a long way. kid.
huh?

363
00:19:32.252 --> 00:19:34.822
I gotta give it to him.
he never thought small.

364
00:19:42.428 --> 00:19:43.363
Hello. Mrs. Jasmine.

365
00:19:43.396 --> 00:19:44.299
How are we doing?

366
00:19:45.265 --> 00:19:46.399
I see you're doing well.

367
00:19:46.433 --> 00:19:48.102
- Thank you.
- Absolutely. welcome back.

368
00:19:48.135 --> 00:19:49.904
Thank you.

369
00:19:49.936 --> 00:19:50.538
Park up front.

370
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:51.905
Always. yes sir.

371
00:20:04.385 --> 00:20:05.353
- Hi.
- Excuse me.

372
00:20:05.386 --> 00:20:07.422
Can you help me get a
package out of my trunk?

373
00:20:08.355 --> 00:20:09.891
Sure. where's it at?

374
00:20:12.193 --> 00:20:14.060
- Right in here?
- Yeah.

375
00:20:14.094 --> 00:20:15.263
Where's it at right here?

376
00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:16.164
What the...

377
00:20:44.425 --> 00:20:46.828
We've been set up.

378
00:20:49.562 --> 00:20:50.564
Get out of the car.

379
00:20:50.598 --> 00:20:52.867
Out of the car. face forward.

380
00:20:52.899 --> 00:20:53.533
Face forward!

381
00:20:53.567 --> 00:20:55.001
Get down. get down.

382
00:20:55.034 --> 00:20:57.304
Spread out. put your
hands behind your head.

383
00:20:59.205 --> 00:21:01.274
Another kid was arrested
with him. Eqwan Taylor.

384
00:21:01.308 --> 00:21:02.577
He was sent to Jamesburg.

385
00:21:02.609 --> 00:21:03.477
Gladiator camp.

386
00:21:05.945 --> 00:21:08.115
Eqwan Taylor was just added
to Jacob's witness list.

387
00:21:08.147 --> 00:21:10.251
He's the reverend at First
Street Baptist Church

388
00:21:10.283 --> 00:21:11.484
in Los Angeles.

389
00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:14.555
Jacobs is using Taylor to
introduce Dutch's criminal past

390
00:21:14.588 --> 00:21:15.923
to the jury.

391
00:21:15.955 --> 00:21:16.623
Then we're gonna take a hit.

392
00:21:16.656 --> 00:21:17.558
Maybe not. do we have anything

393
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.126
to impeach the good reverend's
testimony?

394
00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:21.995
Nothing yet. but our
investigators

395
00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:22.997
are still in LA working on it.

396
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.365
Get them to work faster.

397
00:21:24.397 --> 00:21:27.100
In the meantime. I'm gonna
gut Jacobs' first witness.

398
00:21:31.437 --> 00:21:34.242
Can you state your
name for the court. sir?

399
00:21:34.274 --> 00:21:35.209
Kenneth Jackson.

400
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:38.445
And where do you
currently reside?

401
00:21:39.346 --> 00:21:41.583
In a halfway house off of
Broad Street.

402
00:21:43.951 --> 00:21:45.886
And do you know Bernard James?

403
00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:48.021
Of course I do. who don't?

404
00:21:48.955 --> 00:21:50.324
He's sitting right over there.

405
00:21:51.692 --> 00:21:53.594
And when was the first
time you met Bernard James?

406
00:21:53.626 --> 00:21:55.328
- Objection.
- Overruled.

407
00:21:55.361 --> 00:21:58.531
Again. when was the first
time you met Bernard James?

408
00:21:58.565 --> 00:22:00.568
Not until he came to Mountain
View.

409
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.435
And that would be Mountain
View

410
00:22:02.469 --> 00:22:04.672
Correctional Facility. right?

411
00:22:04.704 --> 00:22:05.639
Yes. sir.

412
00:22:05.673 --> 00:22:08.476
And can you describe
Bernard James's stay

413
00:22:08.509 --> 00:22:10.478
at Mountain View correctional
facility?

414
00:22:11.611 --> 00:22:14.080
Well. from the jump. Dutch
came in like he had something

415
00:22:14.114 --> 00:22:16.951
to prove. like he had
a chip in his shoulder.

416
00:22:16.983 --> 00:22:18.551
He wasn't inside five minutes

417
00:22:18.585 --> 00:22:20.688
and he was already stirring up
shit.

418
00:22:23.957 --> 00:22:26.359
So Bernard James came into
prison a violent person.

419
00:22:26.393 --> 00:22:27.227
is that correct?

420
00:22:27.261 --> 00:22:29.597
I mean. he wasn't a killer or
nothing.

421
00:22:29.629 --> 00:22:32.433
but he definitely made his
presence known.

422
00:22:32.465 --> 00:22:34.334
And I respected that.

423
00:22:34.367 --> 00:22:37.405
Was there any gang
activity at Mountain View?

424
00:22:37.437 --> 00:22:40.040
Everybody was in a gang. if
that's what you wanna call it.

425
00:22:40.073 --> 00:22:41.241
It was just cliqued up.

426
00:22:42.276 --> 00:22:46.180
I mean. they got together
on a county versus county

427
00:22:46.847 --> 00:22:50.017
or a city versus city basis.

428
00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:50.918
Narc. nigga.

429
00:22:52.152 --> 00:22:53.087
Fuck off me. man.

430
00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:55.423
Sometimes it's street
versus street basis.

431
00:22:55.455 --> 00:22:57.190
It depended on where you were at

432
00:22:57.223 --> 00:22:58.659
to determine who you were with.

433
00:23:00.394 --> 00:23:03.463
Now. I'm gonna ask you

434
00:23:03.496 --> 00:23:05.999
was Bernard James involved in a
gang?

435
00:23:11.605 --> 00:23:14.107
Everybody was. especially him.

436
00:23:15.376 --> 00:23:16.210
Especially?

437
00:23:16.242 --> 00:23:18.178
Dutch ran Mountain View.

438
00:23:18.212 --> 00:23:21.516
And if Newark was brought
up. he would be frontline.

439
00:23:22.482 --> 00:23:25.153
He was the man. bottom line.

440
00:23:28.655 --> 00:23:29.523
Thank you.

441
00:23:31.524 --> 00:23:32.592
Your witness.

442
00:23:34.028 --> 00:23:36.163
Mr. Jackson. you
testified that everybody

443
00:23:36.195 --> 00:23:37.697
at Mountain View was in a gang.

444
00:23:37.731 --> 00:23:38.598
That's right.

445
00:23:42.735 --> 00:23:45.272
So were you in a gang?

446
00:23:46.572 --> 00:23:49.576
Like I said. everybody was.

447
00:23:49.609 --> 00:23:51.311
And if one gang member had a
problem

448
00:23:51.345 --> 00:23:54.248
with another gang member.
they would do anything

449
00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.050
to take them out. right?

450
00:23:57.117 --> 00:23:58.085
Wasn't no picnic.

451
00:23:58.117 --> 00:24:00.053
You had to do what you
had to do to survive.

452
00:24:00.087 --> 00:24:01.388
Like what?

453
00:24:01.422 --> 00:24:03.024
Whatever it took.

454
00:24:03.057 --> 00:24:03.724
Lie?

455
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.094
That's the least of it.

456
00:24:07.126 --> 00:24:08.662
Kill?

457
00:24:08.694 --> 00:24:11.098
Guards won't let you kill
nobody. but short of it.

458
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.165
Good for them.

459
00:24:13.399 --> 00:24:14.401
Are you from Newark?

460
00:24:16.369 --> 00:24:17.338
No. ma'am.

461
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.773
I'm from North Bergen
Township. Hudson County.

462
00:24:19.807 --> 00:24:22.777
A lot of tough guys
come out of North Bergen.

463
00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:25.146
You'd be surprised.
ma'am.

464
00:24:25.178 --> 00:24:26.280
Are you a tough guy?

465
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.216
Let's just say I can hold my
own.

466
00:24:30.451 --> 00:24:33.421
And you and Mr. James
were in a rival gang

467
00:24:33.453 --> 00:24:35.289
at Mountain View. right?

468
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.590
What are you talking about?

469
00:24:37.624 --> 00:24:39.693
You said earlier that
inmates at Mountain View

470
00:24:39.725 --> 00:24:42.396
got together on a county versus
county

471
00:24:42.428 --> 00:24:44.764
or city versus city basis.

472
00:24:44.798 --> 00:24:47.801
Mr. James is from Newark.
you're from North Bergen.

473
00:24:47.835 --> 00:24:50.538
therefore you're rivals. right?

474
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.173
We wasn't homies or nothing
like that

475
00:24:52.205 --> 00:24:53.040
if that's what you asking.

476
00:24:53.073 --> 00:24:54.541
That's why you're here
testifying today

477
00:24:54.575 --> 00:24:57.211
because you and Mr. James were
rivals

478
00:24:57.243 --> 00:24:58.611
and a gang member will do
anything

479
00:24:58.645 --> 00:25:01.281
to take out a rival gang member.
right?

480
00:25:01.315 --> 00:25:02.482
I don't know what you're
talking about.

481
00:25:02.515 --> 00:25:04.184
So it wasn't true when you
say lying is the very least

482
00:25:04.217 --> 00:25:06.519
you would do take out a rival
gang member?

483
00:25:06.552 --> 00:25:07.854
Were you lying then or were you
lying now?

484
00:25:07.887 --> 00:25:09.589
Which is it. Mr. Jackson?

485
00:25:09.623 --> 00:25:11.425
Objection. argumentative.

486
00:25:11.457 --> 00:25:12.426
Sustained.

487
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.263
Mr. Jackson. one last
question.

488
00:25:17.297 --> 00:25:20.233
Where are you staying
while appearing in court?

489
00:25:20.267 --> 00:25:22.303
The district attorney's
office put me up at the Hilton.

490
00:25:22.336 --> 00:25:24.371
I'd imagine the Hilton is a
lot nicer

491
00:25:24.404 --> 00:25:26.740
than the halfway house on Broad
Street.

492
00:25:26.772 --> 00:25:27.907
Objection.

493
00:25:27.941 --> 00:25:31.779
Withdrawn. I'm done with
this liar. I mean. witness.

494
00:25:46.792 --> 00:25:47.661
Jacobs.

495
00:25:49.163 --> 00:25:51.566
Gah. shit. it was supposed
to be done an hour ago.

496
00:25:52.566 --> 00:25:53.667
What time?

497
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.669
5:30. it's gonna be ready.

498
00:25:55.702 --> 00:25:57.637
But look. if I can't make
it. let's just leave the keys

499
00:25:57.671 --> 00:25:58.905
at the service department.

500
00:25:58.938 --> 00:26:00.406
Yeah. I know.

501
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.576
All right. bye. thanks.

502
00:26:02.576 --> 00:26:05.179
I'm going to visit Roc and Angel

503
00:26:05.212 --> 00:26:06.413
and I'm gonna make them a deal.

504
00:26:06.445 --> 00:26:07.314
Okay.

505
00:26:17.691 --> 00:26:18.826
There he is.

506
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.828
Roc. right?

507
00:26:22.261 --> 00:26:24.397
I am District Attorney Anthony
Jacobs.

508
00:26:25.499 --> 00:26:26.567
They treating you well in here?

509
00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:29.669
District attorney Anthony
Jacobs. what you want?

510
00:26:31.271 --> 00:26:33.773
Look. we know you're
not top of the chain.

511
00:26:34.607 --> 00:26:37.845
We know it's Bernard James.
Dutch.

512
00:26:39.413 --> 00:26:42.415
Now. I could cut a deal with you
right now

513
00:26:42.448 --> 00:26:45.485
and have you back on the
streets in less than a month.

514
00:26:45.519 --> 00:26:47.788
The only thing I want is Dutch.

515
00:26:51.325 --> 00:26:52.927
You must not know me.

516
00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.228
I ain't no snitch.

517
00:26:55.896 --> 00:26:56.797
I respect that.

518
00:26:58.632 --> 00:27:00.601
Oh. what was I thinking?

519
00:27:01.734 --> 00:27:03.771
Congrats. on the baby. right?

520
00:27:03.803 --> 00:27:05.838
What did you have a boy or a
girl?

521
00:27:05.871 --> 00:27:07.072
I guess it really doesn't matter

522
00:27:07.107 --> 00:27:10.478
because you won't be seeing
him or her for quite some time.

523
00:27:11.578 --> 00:27:15.316
Now. what did you tell Aisha
that you didn't want your kids

524
00:27:15.348 --> 00:27:19.619
to see you caged like an animal?

525
00:27:24.023 --> 00:27:27.493
Look. get me some McDonald's.

526
00:27:27.527 --> 00:27:29.797
When you come back. I
might remember something.

527
00:27:30.864 --> 00:27:31.531
Can you do that?

528
00:27:31.565 --> 00:27:34.934
Oh yeah. Big Mac. fries. Coke?

529
00:27:34.967 --> 00:27:36.236
- Yeah.
- Done.

530
00:27:47.981 --> 00:27:49.517
How was the meal?

531
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.286
This'll last me till I get
out.

532
00:27:52.319 --> 00:27:54.488
Okay. well. I guess we can
talk

533
00:27:54.521 --> 00:27:57.657
about the bombing at the police
precinct.

534
00:28:01.427 --> 00:28:05.431
Look. I already told you.

535
00:28:05.464 --> 00:28:07.001
I ain't no fucking snitch.

536
00:28:07.033 --> 00:28:09.035
Get the fuck outta here.

537
00:28:09.069 --> 00:28:13.473
Wait a second. I thought
we had a deal here.

538
00:28:13.507 --> 00:28:15.643
Yeah. the deal is get
the fuck outta here.

539
00:28:16.643 --> 00:28:18.679
You're making a big mistake.

540
00:28:18.712 --> 00:28:22.282
You will never see the light
of day. I guarantee it.

541
00:28:22.316 --> 00:28:23.617
Get the fuck outta here!

542
00:28:43.036 --> 00:28:44.038
Get dressed.

543
00:29:03.956 --> 00:29:05.925
Hands behind
your back. inmate.

544
00:29:13.966 --> 00:29:16.803
What the fuck do you want?

545
00:29:16.837 --> 00:29:19.106
You're a very pretty girl.
Angel.

546
00:29:19.138 --> 00:29:24.344
Oh.

547
00:29:24.578 --> 00:29:26.446
Let's see here.

548
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.848
Possession with the intent to
distribute.

549
00:29:29.915 --> 00:29:31.085
accessory to murder.

550
00:29:32.685 --> 00:29:33.953
That's 20 to life.

551
00:29:34.687 --> 00:29:39.359
You won't be so pretty when
you get out. if you get out.

552
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:45.899
Yeah. look. I know how
much Dutch meant to you.

553
00:29:46.599 --> 00:29:49.102
Took you out of that
hellhole on Dayton Street.

554
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:53.440
but you were young.
impressionable.

555
00:29:53.473 --> 00:29:54.942
You didn't know what you were
doing.

556
00:29:54.974 --> 00:29:57.410
And now. look where you are now.

557
00:29:59.078 --> 00:30:01.749
I can make your time here
easier.

558
00:30:04.417 --> 00:30:07.687
Do yourself a favor. testify
against him.

559
00:30:08.989 --> 00:30:11.725
I'm not a fucking snitch.

560
00:30:11.758 --> 00:30:13.427
I appreciate that loyalty.

561
00:30:15.729 --> 00:30:20.034
Let me ask you. would
Dutch do the same for you?

562
00:30:29.075 --> 00:30:31.678
Fuck you and fuck your deal.

563
00:30:31.711 --> 00:30:34.115
Get that fucking cunt out of
my face.

564
00:30:41.053 --> 00:30:43.189
I saw the way the jury
watched you. they like you.

565
00:30:43.223 --> 00:30:44.892
They want you to win this.

566
00:30:44.925 --> 00:30:47.594
I can dazzle the jury
with clever rhetoric.

567
00:30:47.626 --> 00:30:50.798
make the men want me. make
the women wanna be me.

568
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.166
but when the show is over.
nothing is going to be able

569
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.568
to blind them from the fact

570
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.703
that there are 27 police
officers dead

571
00:30:57.736 --> 00:31:00.073
and they're gonna want
someone to answer for it.

572
00:31:05.712 --> 00:31:08.015
And that is gonna be Bernard
James.

573
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:14.588
You know what my wife tells
me?

574
00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.757
That you have a shitty boss
that makes you work too much.

575
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:20.894
That trials aren't won by
clients. they're won by lawyers

576
00:31:20.926 --> 00:31:21.962
and you're gonna win it for him.

577
00:31:21.994 --> 00:31:23.996
That would be true if
our client was anyone else

578
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.833
but Bernard James.

579
00:31:25.866 --> 00:31:28.535
His presence commands attention

580
00:31:28.568 --> 00:31:30.838
and the jury. they can't
take their eyes off him

581
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.607
sitting there like a king
daring to find him guilty.

582
00:31:33.639 --> 00:31:35.541
But all we need is one
juror looking for a reason

583
00:31:35.575 --> 00:31:38.812
to let him go and you're
gonna be that reason.

584
00:32:08.241 --> 00:32:10.109
What have you got
me into?

585
00:32:11.176 --> 00:32:12.011
Good evening. counselor.

586
00:32:12.044 --> 00:32:14.046
What the fuck did you get me
into?

587
00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:14.915
I told you.

588
00:32:14.947 --> 00:32:16.050
Like hell you did.

589
00:32:19.118 --> 00:32:20.253
I told you everything you need
to know

590
00:32:20.287 --> 00:32:21.722
to represent me on this case.

591
00:32:21.754 --> 00:32:22.955
Now tell me everything I don't
know

592
00:32:22.989 --> 00:32:24.658
and I'll decide what's
important.

593
00:32:24.691 --> 00:32:25.659
That wasn't our agreement.

594
00:32:25.692 --> 00:32:27.661
Our agreement changed
the moment some nut case

595
00:32:27.694 --> 00:32:30.563
in a Monte Carlo did a
drive-by on my house.

596
00:32:32.132 --> 00:32:33.133
Are you sure it was a Monte
Carlo?

597
00:32:33.166 --> 00:32:35.135
I'm asking the questions
and you're answering

598
00:32:35.167 --> 00:32:36.936
or you're gonna need a new
lawyer.

599
00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.259
Ha-ha. it's been a
long time.

600
00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:00.226
Too long.

601
00:33:04.364 --> 00:33:08.302
Man. finally some fresh air.
free air.

602
00:33:08.335 --> 00:33:10.971
Nobody telling me what to do.
I'm good.

603
00:33:11.003 --> 00:33:11.871
Dutch!

604
00:33:12.973 --> 00:33:13.840
Hey!

605
00:33:15.809 --> 00:33:17.711
Ay Papi. you're out.

606
00:33:17.743 --> 00:33:19.780
I can't believe it. I missed you
so much.

607
00:33:20.579 --> 00:33:22.582
You know I wasn't gonna be
able to stop her from coming.

608
00:33:22.616 --> 00:33:23.817
Man. now I know I'm blessed.

609
00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:26.986
Two of my favorite people in
the world on the day I get out.

610
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.722
And you've got a new ride.

611
00:33:28.754 --> 00:33:29.589
No shit.

612
00:33:29.623 --> 00:33:30.658
Real shit. bruh.

613
00:33:32.626 --> 00:33:33.293
Damn. let's get the fuck out
of here.

614
00:33:35.729 --> 00:33:37.097
Let's go.

615
00:33:37.129 --> 00:33:38.764
You free now.

616
00:33:50.944 --> 00:33:53.614
So where you wanna go
first. your mom's. Roberto.

617
00:33:53.646 --> 00:33:55.148
Fat Tony or some thots?

618
00:33:56.049 --> 00:33:56.916
My moms.

619
00:33:59.152 --> 00:34:01.355
Who poppin' in the streets now?

620
00:34:01.387 --> 00:34:03.956
This cat. Kazami. popped up
out of nowhere on Springfield

621
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:06.359
after you got locked up
and started housing shit.

622
00:34:22.876 --> 00:34:24.410
You making this motherfucker
sound like a super hero

623
00:34:24.443 --> 00:34:25.478
or some shit.

624
00:34:25.511 --> 00:34:27.280
For real. within a year
Kazami took over Newark.

625
00:34:27.312 --> 00:34:29.415
Elizabeth. Linden and East
Orange.

626
00:34:29.448 --> 00:34:31.351
shit most of Jersey City
honestly.

627
00:34:34.453 --> 00:34:37.323
People thought dude was Haitian.
but he's really Nigerian.

628
00:34:37.356 --> 00:34:38.324
brought a whole crew with him

629
00:34:38.357 --> 00:34:41.127
that's used to guerrilla
warfare out in Africa.

630
00:34:52.738 --> 00:34:54.407
Fat Tony just let him do it?

631
00:34:54.441 --> 00:34:57.044
I mean. Frank Sorbonno
moved up in the family.

632
00:34:57.077 --> 00:35:01.314
put a couple hits out on
Kazami. missed twice. pathetic.

633
00:35:01.347 --> 00:35:04.117
That shit only gave
Kazami more street cred.

634
00:35:04.149 --> 00:35:06.452
Frank got Monte Carlo on him
now.

635
00:35:06.486 --> 00:35:08.455
Wait. you talking about that
Italian cat

636
00:35:08.488 --> 00:35:10.022
that be in the old Monte Carlo?

637
00:35:10.055 --> 00:35:10.823
Yep.

638
00:35:10.856 --> 00:35:12.124
No wonder they can't get
Kazami.

639
00:35:12.158 --> 00:35:14.227
Monte Carlo is shit for brains.

640
00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.696
Only reason he ain't been tipped
over

641
00:35:15.729 --> 00:35:18.298
is 'cause of police protection.

642
00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:19.966
So what are you doing?

643
00:35:19.999 --> 00:35:21.868
It's like I've been
stuck.

644
00:35:21.901 --> 00:35:24.937
I've known you forever
and it's always been us.

645
00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.940
Rock and Zoom my people
and Shock rest in peace

646
00:35:29.274 --> 00:35:30.910
but without you here on point.
man.

647
00:35:30.943 --> 00:35:33.212
it's like I ain't been
able to get no traction.

648
00:35:54.501 --> 00:35:55.368
Hey. Ma.

649
00:35:58.138 --> 00:35:59.740
When did you get home?

650
00:35:59.772 --> 00:36:00.874
Today. just now.

651
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:19.992
So you moved. huh?

652
00:36:21.327 --> 00:36:22.196
Yeah.

653
00:36:29.169 --> 00:36:30.804
What did you do with all
the stuff I bought you?

654
00:36:30.836 --> 00:36:31.871
You bought?

655
00:36:33.039 --> 00:36:34.508
Ma. listen. I know I messed up

656
00:36:35.374 --> 00:36:37.376
and I know you're probably
mad at me. but you could have

657
00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.812
at least came and seen
me once or wrote back.

658
00:36:40.479 --> 00:36:43.783
I wrote you every week
and you just up and move?

659
00:36:45.084 --> 00:36:46.419
Well. that's 'cause you a
goddamn fool

660
00:36:46.452 --> 00:36:47.821
and you're a goddamn coward.

661
00:36:47.854 --> 00:36:50.022
And yeah. I was mad
not for what you did do

662
00:36:50.055 --> 00:36:51.524
but for what you didn't do.

663
00:36:53.225 --> 00:36:55.495
You let them lock you
up like you was a dog.

664
00:36:56.196 --> 00:36:58.132
And you expect me to write you.

665
00:36:59.332 --> 00:37:00.934
You must be crazy. boy.

666
00:37:01.667 --> 00:37:04.070
What I got to say you
don't want me to write.

667
00:37:05.604 --> 00:37:08.107
You let them take you away from
me.

668
00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.909
And you didn't do nothing about
it.

669
00:37:09.943 --> 00:37:12.879
And yeah. all that shit
that you bought me.

670
00:37:12.912 --> 00:37:14.114
I left it where it was.

671
00:37:14.147 --> 00:37:17.017
I let it rot. I left it.

672
00:37:18.984 --> 00:37:21.521
All that bullshit you
traded your freedom in for.

673
00:37:21.553 --> 00:37:22.888
you think I want that?

674
00:37:22.921 --> 00:37:24.824
You think that's what I want?

675
00:37:24.857 --> 00:37:26.160
You think I wanna keep that?

676
00:37:41.406 --> 00:37:42.307
I ain't going back.

677
00:37:42.341 --> 00:37:45.278
You damn right you're not
going back.

678
00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:46.546
I'll kill you myself.

679
00:37:46.578 --> 00:37:49.348
I'll kill you myself.

680
00:37:49.381 --> 00:37:52.919
Get off of me. get off of me.

681
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:59.960
You go get what them people took
from you.

682
00:38:00.926 --> 00:38:04.997
Go back and get what the
people took from you.

683
00:38:09.368 --> 00:38:10.236
Bernard.

684
00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:20.180
Your mother seems like
a special type of woman.

685
00:38:20.213 --> 00:38:21.848
Imagine being raised by her.

686
00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:24.250
At some point in the near
future.

687
00:38:24.283 --> 00:38:25.986
we're gonna finish this
conversation.

688
00:38:26.952 --> 00:38:28.287
I could offer you protection.

689
00:38:28.321 --> 00:38:29.990
I'm good. trust me.

690
00:38:31.691 --> 00:38:33.393
Look. I didn't know they
were gonna come after you

691
00:38:33.426 --> 00:38:34.594
to get to me.

692
00:38:34.627 --> 00:38:37.164
You're doing a great job.
you can't lose your cool now.

693
00:38:38.064 --> 00:38:39.899
I win 98% of my cases.

694
00:38:39.932 --> 00:38:41.934
run a six-minute mile with a
.45.

695
00:38:41.968 --> 00:38:44.136
The last thing I'm gonna
do is lose my cool.

696
00:38:46.539 --> 00:38:47.607
Good night. Mr. James.

697
00:39:46.399 --> 00:39:48.268
Fuck you. Monte Carlo.

698
00:40:06.486 --> 00:40:08.488
Boy. Qwan wanna holla at you.

699
00:40:08.521 --> 00:40:10.223
What fat boy want?

700
00:40:10.256 --> 00:40:12.258
I don't know.

701
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:13.292
All right.

702
00:40:19.064 --> 00:40:21.501
He ready for you.

703
00:40:32.477 --> 00:40:33.347
What up?

704
00:40:35.347 --> 00:40:38.117
Hey. I appreciate everything
you done for me. Dutch.

705
00:40:39.252 --> 00:40:41.688
but I be waking up sweating
tears.

706
00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.556
I can't tell the
difference between the two.

707
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:47.493
And it's so many people out
here dying. it's too many.

708
00:40:47.526 --> 00:40:49.495
I be thinking somebody gonna
kill me

709
00:40:49.528 --> 00:40:51.731
or my mom or my sister.

710
00:40:52.531 --> 00:40:54.700
Don't you ever have thoughts
like that?

711
00:40:55.635 --> 00:40:56.502
No.

712
00:40:59.539 --> 00:41:02.508
Well. I do. man. I think about
it a lot.

713
00:41:02.542 --> 00:41:04.344
I couldn't live with
myself if I did something

714
00:41:04.377 --> 00:41:07.014
that would cause pain to my
family.

715
00:41:08.247 --> 00:41:10.817
It ain't in me no more. Dutch.
it ain't.

716
00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:13.587
If I said it was. I'd be
frontin'.

717
00:41:16.488 --> 00:41:17.723
Ain't no future in that.

718
00:41:19.191 --> 00:41:23.328
I know. man. so yo.
I'm moving out to L.A.

719
00:41:23.361 --> 00:41:24.664
I'm gonna stay with my aunt.

720
00:41:57.396 --> 00:41:59.598
I told you he wasn't
built for this shit.

721
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:03.235
He knows too much. way too much.

722
00:42:03.269 --> 00:42:04.203
We shouldn't have let
him walk out of here.

723
00:42:04.236 --> 00:42:05.439
Let me take care of that.

724
00:42:06.671 --> 00:42:07.640
What he gonna do?

725
00:42:08.707 --> 00:42:09.876
Nothing but go to California

726
00:42:09.908 --> 00:42:11.811
and become some preacher or some
shit.

727
00:42:13.646 --> 00:42:14.513
Let him go.

728
00:42:16.515 --> 00:42:18.718
Shit. if that's what he
wanna do. all glory to God.

729
00:42:38.638 --> 00:42:39.739
Do you solemnly swear

730
00:42:39.772 --> 00:42:41.807

presenting today is the truth.

731
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:44.544

but the truth. so help you God?

732
00:42:44.577 --> 00:42:45.410

You may have a seat.

State your name for the court.

735
00:42:51.783 --> 00:42:53.752

In Los Angeles. California.

738
00:42:57.689 --> 00:43:00.193
I'm the reverend of First
Street Baptist Church.

739
00:43:00.225 --> 00:43:02.394
And where did you
live prior to California?

740
00:43:02.428 --> 00:43:03.530
Right here in Newark.

741
00:43:04.497 --> 00:43:06.566
And were you ever connected

742
00:43:06.598 --> 00:43:08.401
to the defendant. Bernard James?

743
00:43:09.901 --> 00:43:11.303
Yes.
How so?

744
00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.305
We were friends.

745
00:43:13.339 --> 00:43:14.374
In fact. isn't it true

746
00:43:14.406 --> 00:43:16.309
that you and Bernard James
were in prison together

747
00:43:16.341 --> 00:43:17.644
for grand larceny?

748
00:43:17.676 --> 00:43:18.544
Yes. sir.

749
00:43:20.446 --> 00:43:23.583
Have you ever heard of
a man name Azugol Kazami?

750
00:43:24.917 --> 00:43:26.252
Yes.

751
00:43:26.285 --> 00:43:27.286
How so?

752
00:43:27.319 --> 00:43:29.888
Bernard and I had
discussed killing Kazami.

753
00:43:29.921 --> 00:43:33.693
Objection. your honor. Mr.
James has never been charged

754
00:43:33.725 --> 00:43:35.761
with the murder of Azugol
Kazami.

755
00:43:35.794 --> 00:43:36.628
A point I'm sure you'll make
clear

756
00:43:36.662 --> 00:43:38.564
in your cross. counselor.
overruled.

757
00:43:41.633 --> 00:43:45.737
So Reverend. in your best
ability.

758
00:43:45.771 --> 00:43:47.973
can you share with us
the conversation you had

759
00:43:48.006 --> 00:43:50.776
regarding the murder of Azugol
Kazami?

760
00:43:53.646 --> 00:43:55.515
Look. what I'm about to put
y'all up on

761
00:43:55.548 --> 00:43:57.816
ain't like shit we ever did
before.

762
00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.353
So if y'all ain't bout
it. y'all can bounce.

763
00:44:00.385 --> 00:44:01.553
Man. why you talking
to us like that. Dutch?

764
00:44:01.586 --> 00:44:02.588
You know we down.

765
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:05.325
Oh yeah?

766
00:44:06.691 --> 00:44:08.727
I'm taking over the drug trade
in Newark.

767
00:44:11.263 --> 00:44:12.097
What the fuck. Dutch?

768
00:44:12.131 --> 00:44:13.765
What you gonna do. compete with
Kazami?

769
00:44:13.798 --> 00:44:14.667
Nah.

770
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:18.738
We kill Kazami.

771
00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.809
Kill Kazami?

772
00:44:24.276 --> 00:44:25.611
I ain't saying you
wrong or nothing. Dutch.

773
00:44:25.644 --> 00:44:28.580
but killing dude. he'd murc us

774
00:44:28.613 --> 00:44:29.982
if he thought we was
thinking about sticking him.

775
00:44:30.015 --> 00:44:31.084
let alone killing him.

776
00:44:31.117 --> 00:44:33.586
We don't know where he
lives or how to get to him.

777
00:44:33.618 --> 00:44:34.787
He's married and got a kid.

778
00:44:34.819 --> 00:44:37.723
Boom. that's how we get to
him.

779
00:44:37.756 --> 00:44:40.559
What. we gonna kidnap
his girl and his kid?

780
00:44:40.593 --> 00:44:41.761
You wanna snatch her?

781
00:44:41.794 --> 00:44:43.663
She know what she signed
up for when she got with him.

782
00:44:43.696 --> 00:44:47.667
but nah. Kazami ain't breaking
his neck over no bitch.

783
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.368
We get her to set him up.

784
00:44:49.401 --> 00:44:51.903
She ain't gonna turn on her
meal ticket.

785
00:44:51.937 --> 00:44:53.373
Sugar Ray will flip her.

786
00:44:55.073 --> 00:44:56.709
That wannabe pimp
motherfucker?

787
00:44:56.742 --> 00:44:58.377
Yeah. Sugar Ray ain't going
for that.

788
00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:00.912
Sugar Ray like money
just like anybody else.

789
00:45:00.946 --> 00:45:02.415
He'll do it for the paper.

790
00:45:04.883 --> 00:45:09.655
Reverend Taylor. Reverend
Taylor. are you all right?

791
00:45:10.689 --> 00:45:12.258
Yes. I'm good. I'm okay.

792
00:45:13.892 --> 00:45:14.860
You need a break?

793
00:45:16.062 --> 00:45:17.764
Yeah. I think I need a moment.

794
00:45:18.964 --> 00:45:21.434
Your honor. short break for my
witness.

795
00:45:21.466 --> 00:45:23.869
This court stands
for a 30 minute recess.

796
00:45:38.651 --> 00:45:40.486
What were we talking about?

797
00:45:40.519 --> 00:45:41.587
Kazami.

798
00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.522
Right. right. the African.

799
00:45:43.555 --> 00:45:44.823
Mm-hm.

800
00:45:46.959 --> 00:45:48.595
I don't know about that. man.

801
00:45:49.562 --> 00:45:50.830
It may be too hard.

802
00:45:50.863 --> 00:45:52.464
Come on. man. anybody could
get got.

803
00:45:52.497 --> 00:45:54.766
Yeah. that shit go both ways.

804
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.935
Didn't Kazami get two
hits put out on him?

805
00:45:58.903 --> 00:45:59.938
They missed twice.

806
00:46:02.006 --> 00:46:03.809
What the fuck make you
think we can get him?

807
00:46:03.843 --> 00:46:06.479
Well. that's why we need you.
Sugar Ray.

808
00:46:06.511 --> 00:46:07.814
His broad's the weak link.

809
00:46:07.847 --> 00:46:08.948
They always are.

810
00:46:08.981 --> 00:46:10.950
If anybody can bag him. it's
you.

811
00:46:10.982 --> 00:46:12.751
Now. shit. the mob might miss
twice.

812
00:46:12.785 --> 00:46:14.354
but everybody know Sugar Ray
don't.

813
00:46:14.386 --> 00:46:15.955
You trying to gas me up.

814
00:46:15.988 --> 00:46:19.459
Of course. Sugar. I'm the Sugar
Man. of course I don't miss.

815
00:46:22.694 --> 00:46:24.629
That's to show you we real
about this.

816
00:46:24.662 --> 00:46:27.566
And if you go at Simone and
miss. my word.

817
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.702
my car is yours.

818
00:46:38.042 --> 00:46:39.111
The beamer in front?

819
00:46:39.144 --> 00:46:40.012
Yep.

820
00:46:42.046 --> 00:46:46.685
See. Kazami. he can give
a bitch everything she want

821
00:46:47.986 --> 00:46:49.455
except that understanding.

822
00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:52.658
That's when the Sugar Man come
into play.

823
00:46:52.691 --> 00:46:54.160
you know what I'm saying?

824
00:46:54.193 --> 00:46:57.097
See. I'm the shelter to a bitch
storm.

825
00:46:58.664 --> 00:47:00.399
Gotta create the storm.

826
00:47:00.432 --> 00:47:01.100
The storm?

827
00:47:02.133 --> 00:47:03.735
Like some emotional shit

828
00:47:03.769 --> 00:47:05.738
that Kazami can't buy himself
out of.

829
00:47:05.771 --> 00:47:06.939
Like what?

830
00:47:06.972 --> 00:47:08.941
I don't know. like kill
his bitch daddy or something.

831
00:47:08.973 --> 00:47:09.843
Shit.

832
00:47:12.912 --> 00:47:14.547
We'll be in touch. Sugar Ray.

833
00:47:21.653 --> 00:47:22.789
Be creative.

834
00:47:22.821 --> 00:47:24.890
Ay. you got some panties on?

835
00:47:24.923 --> 00:47:28.193
So Sugar Ray suggested it.

836
00:47:28.227 --> 00:47:30.763
even though he wasn't
serious about you doing it?

837
00:47:30.796 --> 00:47:33.698
Objection. the district
attorney can't possibly expect

838
00:47:33.731 --> 00:47:35.600
the witness to know what
Sugar Ray was thinking.

839
00:47:35.633 --> 00:47:36.769
Sustained.

840
00:47:36.801 --> 00:47:40.439
Reverend Taylor. do you
think Sugar Ray was serious?

841
00:47:40.472 --> 00:47:41.673
Nah.

842
00:47:41.707 --> 00:47:44.410
Do you think the defendant
thought Sugar Ray was serious?

843
00:47:45.644 --> 00:47:46.479
Yes.

844
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:47.180
How so?

845
00:48:02.495 --> 00:48:04.163
You sure you got this?

846
00:48:04.196 --> 00:48:06.699
I got my killer fit on. I'm
ready.

847
00:48:08.133 --> 00:48:09.033
You know I can do this for
you.

848
00:48:09.068 --> 00:48:11.470
I'm gonna show Dutch. man. I
got this.

849
00:48:12.972 --> 00:48:14.841
All right. let's get it.

850
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.982
The murder of Mr. Smith
not only served as a message

851
00:48:24.015 --> 00:48:26.785
to Kazami but to the rest of the
crew.

852
00:48:43.068 --> 00:48:43.937
No!

853
00:49:04.957 --> 00:49:07.193
The stronger message
was that he was willing

854
00:49:07.225 --> 00:49:09.896
to do anything to get
what he wanted. anything

855
00:49:09.928 --> 00:49:14.733
and just like Sugar Ray
said. Simone fell apart.

856
00:49:17.769 --> 00:49:21.239
Whoa. slow down.
slow down.

857
00:49:21.272 --> 00:49:22.541
You don't know what it's like.
Ray.

858
00:49:22.575 --> 00:49:25.278
I do know how it is to be with
a man

859
00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:27.146
that don't protect you from your
enemies.

860
00:49:27.178 --> 00:49:28.981
You know he's using all the
time.

861
00:49:29.881 --> 00:49:31.117
We got a child in the house.

862
00:49:31.149 --> 00:49:33.151
Baby. that's just to cure his
soul

863
00:49:33.185 --> 00:49:35.621
from the guilt he's consumed
with.

864
00:49:35.653 --> 00:49:39.724
Let me tell you something.
his days of reckoning.

865
00:49:39.758 --> 00:49:40.792
oh. they coming.

866
00:49:40.825 --> 00:49:43.094
Yeah. but how long are
we gonna have to wait for?

867
00:49:43.127 --> 00:49:45.832
Kazami makes my skin crawl
every time he touches me.

868
00:49:46.566 --> 00:49:49.669
You know. I wouldn't be able to
see you

869
00:49:49.702 --> 00:49:51.604
if he didn't let me come and
work out.

870
00:49:52.671 --> 00:49:54.040
I can't take this no more.

871
00:49:54.073 --> 00:49:57.676
Baby. I'm the Sugar
Man. that's why I'm here

872
00:49:57.709 --> 00:50:00.713
to protect you. make sure
your financial resources

873
00:50:00.745 --> 00:50:04.182
is all together for the rest of
your life

874
00:50:04.216 --> 00:50:05.918
for you and your family.

875
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:09.789
but you gotta trust me.
you gotta believe me.

876
00:50:09.821 --> 00:50:11.124
Can you do that for me?

877
00:50:12.992 --> 00:50:15.160
I'll do anything you want.
Ray.

878
00:50:15.193 --> 00:50:17.062
You just gotta help me with my
needs.

879
00:50:18.796 --> 00:50:19.865
Oh. most definitely.

880
00:50:22.334 --> 00:50:24.669
Ay. bring some champagne.

881
00:50:24.702 --> 00:50:26.104
We celebrating over here. man.

882
00:50:27.906 --> 00:50:29.208
I don't think you will
get an argument from anyone

883
00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.209
if you decided to quit.

884
00:50:31.243 --> 00:50:32.244
Or you can call a priest

885
00:50:32.276 --> 00:50:33.713
and y'all can discuss your
future.

886
00:50:33.745 --> 00:50:35.146
You do know regardless of what
we do.

887
00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.716
there's no chance of us winning.

888
00:50:36.749 --> 00:50:37.684
It's problematic for me

889
00:50:37.716 --> 00:50:40.086
when my client sides with the
prosecution.

890
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.222
I make no excuses for who I
am.

891
00:50:46.191 --> 00:50:48.227
We covet what we see first.

892
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.227
Where I grew up.

893
00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.296
being a drug dealer's
how you make your money.

894
00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:53.833
You get one time to be big time.

895
00:50:53.865 --> 00:50:55.400
Great argument. but
it's not gonna stop you

896
00:50:55.434 --> 00:50:57.202
from getting the lethal
injection.

897
00:51:11.216 --> 00:51:12.952
I wanna talk to you about the
deal.

898
00:51:14.019 --> 00:51:16.287
Y'all needed me to crack a
bitch.

899
00:51:16.321 --> 00:51:17.990
You know me. I crack five
bitches

900
00:51:18.022 --> 00:51:19.290
like I crack five knuckles.

901
00:51:19.323 --> 00:51:21.026
you know what I'm saying and
ball my fist.

902
00:51:22.894 --> 00:51:26.832
So it's only right.
50/50 split. 50/50 deal.

903
00:51:29.834 --> 00:51:31.269
I hear what you saying.

904
00:51:31.303 --> 00:51:32.338
I mean. we did call you.

905
00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:35.273
So I'm cool with a 50/50
split under one condition.

906
00:51:37.176 --> 00:51:39.078
Conditions?

907
00:51:39.111 --> 00:51:40.113
You come with us.

908
00:51:40.812 --> 00:51:42.682
I mean. 'cause we could look and
come back

909
00:51:42.714 --> 00:51:43.948
and tell you anything.

910
00:51:43.981 --> 00:51:45.117
Now. if you feel shitted on.

911
00:51:45.149 --> 00:51:47.119
that could ruin a beautiful
partnership.

912
00:51:51.222 --> 00:51:52.891
I ain't got a problem with
that.

913
00:51:52.925 --> 00:51:54.260
So can we get to business?

914
00:51:58.129 --> 00:52:00.198
I got two one-way tickets to
Miami.

915
00:52:00.231 --> 00:52:03.101
She wants to go together
after all this shit go down.

916
00:52:03.135 --> 00:52:04.069
You know what I mean. but you
know me.

917
00:52:04.102 --> 00:52:05.271
I roll alone.

918
00:52:05.303 --> 00:52:06.238
Now. Kazami. if he don't trust
the bitch.

919
00:52:06.272 --> 00:52:08.874
what the fuck I look
like trusting the bitch?

920
00:52:08.906 --> 00:52:09.807
You know what I'm saying?

921
00:52:09.841 --> 00:52:11.209
So I feel like her and Kazambi
should go

922
00:52:11.243 --> 00:52:12.912
on the trip together without me.

923
00:52:14.412 --> 00:52:16.748
Far as the crib. he don't
really keep no real money

924
00:52:16.781 --> 00:52:17.716
in there. you know what I mean?

925
00:52:17.749 --> 00:52:20.985
I mean. she's sprung but he
ain't no fool.

926
00:52:21.019 --> 00:52:22.187
You know what I mean?

927
00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.756
He got two trap houses. one
in Newark. one in Elizabeth.

928
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:26.391
Oh. we got that covered.

929
00:52:27.959 --> 00:52:32.030
The main house in
Roselle. high security.

930
00:52:32.064 --> 00:52:34.200
500 thou on them. Simone
gonna have that packed

931
00:52:34.232 --> 00:52:35.834
in the kitchen waiting for us.

932
00:52:37.068 --> 00:52:37.836
You know what I'm saying?

933
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.739
We gonna go as satellite
repairmen.

934
00:52:40.673 --> 00:52:43.910
Only problem is we can't bring
our straps.

935
00:52:44.877 --> 00:52:47.280
But Simone will have
two guns waiting for us.

936
00:52:48.379 --> 00:52:50.348
So we're going in unarmed.

937
00:52:50.381 --> 00:52:52.283
depending on some chick to gun
us.

938
00:52:52.316 --> 00:52:54.185
I ain't feeling that.

939
00:52:54.218 --> 00:52:55.421
It's the only way. you
know what I'm saying?

940
00:52:55.453 --> 00:52:57.756
You think I wanna go in
there without my heat?

941
00:52:58.823 --> 00:53:01.493
It works for me as long
as that kid ain't there.

942
00:53:01.526 --> 00:53:03.928
Nothing to it. I swear
to God. I'll make her take

943
00:53:03.961 --> 00:53:05.530
that little bastard to her
grandparents.

944
00:53:05.564 --> 00:53:07.934
So we good. let's get it done.

945
00:53:31.557 --> 00:53:33.225
We're here to repair the
satellite.

946
00:53:33.258 --> 00:53:35.194
It's inside. but I
gotta check you first.

947
00:53:36.461 --> 00:53:38.765
Shit. now we committing a
crime?

948
00:53:45.102 --> 00:53:46.872
Can I get my tools?

949
00:54:08.227 --> 00:54:09.562
Hi. I'm Simone.

950
00:54:10.428 --> 00:54:11.530
Nice to meet you.

951
00:54:12.597 --> 00:54:13.365
Do you think you could show us

952
00:54:13.399 --> 00:54:15.034
where your primary box is.
please?

953
00:54:15.066 --> 00:54:17.235
Yeah. right this way.

954
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:33.052
Who the fuck is this?

955
00:54:33.084 --> 00:54:34.919
They're here to fix the
satellite

956
00:54:34.952 --> 00:54:37.021
and you said you weren't
doing that anymore.

957
00:54:37.055 --> 00:54:38.890
What's the point of
sending a boat to your mom

958
00:54:38.923 --> 00:54:40.292
if I can't enjoy myself?

959
00:54:42.627 --> 00:54:44.463
It's cool. I fixed them
already.

960
00:54:50.234 --> 00:54:51.570
Right this way.

961
00:54:53.238 --> 00:54:56.876
Hey!

962
00:54:56.908 --> 00:54:57.843
Wanna ball?

963
00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:00.945
We working. man.

964
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:32.645
You ready?

965
00:55:32.678 --> 00:55:33.546
Let's do it.

966
00:56:06.211 --> 00:56:08.080
Babe. do you have a minute?

967
00:56:08.113 --> 00:56:09.315
Please. please.

968
00:56:17.356 --> 00:56:20.158
Come on. you never dance with
me.

969
00:56:35.073 --> 00:56:35.942
It's clear.

970
00:56:52.423 --> 00:56:54.126
Yo. yo. yo. drop the fucking
gun.

971
00:56:54.158 --> 00:56:55.026
Son of a!

972
00:56:57.428 --> 00:56:58.497
Put it on the table.

973
00:57:03.035 --> 00:57:05.071
Now face the fucking wall on
your knees.

974
00:57:08.673 --> 00:57:09.774
We gonna keep this real simple.

975
00:57:09.807 --> 00:57:10.876
We here for the money.

976
00:57:10.908 --> 00:57:13.144
Now. if it's where it's
supposed to be at. we good.

977
00:57:13.178 --> 00:57:15.513
If it ain't. I'm blowing
her fucking brains out.

978
00:57:32.363 --> 00:57:36.068
I got the baby. bro. let's get
it.

979
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.303
Okay.

980
00:57:49.414 --> 00:57:51.050
Are we good?

981
00:57:51.082 --> 00:57:52.483
Yeah. damn right. we good.

982
00:57:52.517 --> 00:57:54.086
Told you.

983
00:57:54.118 --> 00:57:56.055
Yeah. we got your kid.

984
00:57:56.088 --> 00:57:56.756
It's over.

985
00:58:00.725 --> 00:58:02.328
I have no further questions.

986
00:58:05.196 --> 00:58:06.798
Your witness. Ms.
Nichols.

987
00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.767
I should cross examine him.

988
00:58:09.801 --> 00:58:10.669
Yeah.

989
00:58:13.305 --> 00:58:15.274
Defense has no questions. your
honor.

990
00:58:21.146 --> 00:58:25.117
Hey. Craze . what is it with you?

991
00:58:25.149 --> 00:58:26.350
Why the stone face?

992
00:58:27.318 --> 00:58:28.152
Shh.

993
00:58:28.187 --> 00:58:30.189
You did have a problem with
Kazami.

994
00:58:30.222 --> 00:58:31.557
but you ain't got that problem
no more.

995
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:32.490
What?

996
00:58:33.624 --> 00:58:35.393
Whoa.

997
00:58:35.426 --> 00:58:37.261
Now I know why they call you
Craze.

998
00:58:37.294 --> 00:58:39.597
What are you a fucking
psycho walking around

999
00:58:39.631 --> 00:58:41.634
with this fucking head in this
bag?

1000
00:58:42.468 --> 00:58:44.470
Your man. Lil Frankie right
here.

1001
00:58:45.836 --> 00:58:47.605
yeah. he couldn't finish the
job.

1002
00:58:47.638 --> 00:58:49.307
So we did it as a favor.

1003
00:58:50.075 --> 00:58:51.843
Roberto. what is it
with these fucking kids?

1004
00:58:51.877 --> 00:58:54.313
Here. here. get rid of this
shit.

1005
00:58:54.345 --> 00:58:57.515
Get rid of that. just
get it out of here.

1006
00:58:57.548 --> 00:59:00.251
I gotta admit. though. you
know what?

1007
00:59:00.285 --> 00:59:03.222
This fucking Kazami's been a
thorn in my side for years.

1008
00:59:03.254 --> 00:59:06.591
You got a guy we've been
trying real hard to get.

1009
00:59:06.624 --> 00:59:09.894
So for that. I guess we owe you
a favor

1010
00:59:09.928 --> 00:59:13.632
and I think I know what that
favor is.

1011
00:59:13.664 --> 00:59:16.834
I think you guys wanna take
over the drug trade. right?

1012
00:59:16.868 --> 00:59:19.671
And you need us to
provide police protection.

1013
00:59:19.703 --> 00:59:21.573
so you could be bosses.

1014
00:59:21.606 --> 00:59:24.209
Is that the long and the short
of it?

1015
00:59:24.242 --> 00:59:26.644
And you got yourself a friend.
believe me.

1016
00:59:26.678 --> 00:59:28.747
as long as you live.

1017
00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:29.682
Smile. will you?

1018
00:59:30.515 --> 00:59:32.350
You want me to call Detective
O'Neal?

1019
00:59:32.383 --> 00:59:33.284
That's a good idea.

1020
00:59:33.318 --> 00:59:34.519
tell him they're with us now.
all right.

1021
00:59:34.553 --> 00:59:35.354
Come on. let's go munch.

1022
00:59:35.386 --> 00:59:37.689
Whoa. whoa. I got something to
say.

1023
00:59:38.624 --> 00:59:40.526
I'd take a bullet for the
both of yous right now.

1024
00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:42.194
you know that.

1025
00:59:42.227 --> 00:59:43.729
I don't trust these mulignans.

1026
00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:45.930
They're animals. they speak a
language

1027
00:59:45.964 --> 00:59:48.333
I don't even know what the
fuck they're talking about.

1028
00:59:48.365 --> 00:59:50.434
And that head in a duffel bag.

1029
00:59:50.468 --> 00:59:52.538
it's gonna come back
to bite us in the ass.

1030
00:59:52.571 --> 00:59:53.772
And let me tell you something
right now.

1031
00:59:53.805 --> 00:59:55.773
I'm going on record with you.
Tony. I am not taking a fall

1032
00:59:55.807 --> 00:59:56.975
for these fucking niggers.

1033
00:59:57.008 --> 00:59:59.611
And I'll wack the both of them
right now. it's what I do.

1034
00:59:59.644 --> 01:00:01.479
Do I fucking stutter when I
talk. heh?

1035
01:00:01.513 --> 01:00:02.347
Did you not just hear me?

1036
01:00:02.381 --> 01:00:04.783
Did you not hear me give him my
word.

1037
01:00:04.816 --> 01:00:06.350
you know what my fucking word
is?

1038
01:00:06.383 --> 01:00:07.584
But what is it with you. heh?

1039
01:00:07.618 --> 01:00:10.222
Smarten up. all right. stop
being so fucking color blind.

1040
01:00:10.254 --> 01:00:11.323
Change with the times.

1041
01:00:11.356 --> 01:00:13.524
I know where we can get
some good veal and peppers.

1042
01:00:13.557 --> 01:00:15.593
Oh. look at this. what is
this Mount Everest here?

1043
01:00:15.627 --> 01:00:16.728
Jesus Christ.

1044
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:17.929
Holy shit!

1045
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:20.499
Who hired this kid?

1046
01:00:33.245 --> 01:00:36.515
We should take a vote.
you know. to gauge things.

1047
01:00:36.548 --> 01:00:38.316
That's against the rules.

1048
01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:39.751
Yeah. but save a lot of time

1049
01:00:39.783 --> 01:00:41.419
once you get into deliberation.

1050
01:00:42.687 --> 01:00:45.624
I'm sorry this process
is inconveniencing you.

1051
01:00:45.656 --> 01:00:47.825
but we haven't heard everything
yet.

1052
01:00:47.859 --> 01:00:50.629
I've heard enough. that boy is
guilty.

1053
01:00:50.662 --> 01:00:51.897
Don't y'all feel the same?

1054
01:00:52.696 --> 01:00:55.600
Anybody don't feel the way
Henry does?

1055
01:00:55.633 --> 01:00:58.302
Don't get me wrong. I think
he's guilty

1056
01:00:58.336 --> 01:01:02.540
of a lot of things. just not
what he's being charged with.

1057
01:01:02.573 --> 01:01:05.543
I like his lawyer. I wanna
hear what she has to say.

1058
01:01:50.055 --> 01:01:50.923
Yay!

1059
01:01:54.825 --> 01:01:55.693
There she go.

1060
01:01:55.727 --> 01:01:57.562
- Hey. beautiful.
- Hi.

1061
01:02:02.966 --> 01:02:04.602
What's up. birthday girl?

1062
01:02:04.635 --> 01:02:06.971
Look at the birthday girl.

1063
01:02:07.004 --> 01:02:08.506
Hi.

1064
01:02:08.539 --> 01:02:09.641
Go ahead. make a wish.

1065
01:02:16.548 --> 01:02:17.982
These are Angel's Charlies.

1066
01:02:18.015 --> 01:02:19.483
They're down for whatever.

1067
01:02:19.517 --> 01:02:21.620
Oh yeah. let's get down to the
whatever.

1068
01:02:21.653 --> 01:02:23.589
Wait. wait. wait. glasses.
glasses.

1069
01:02:24.656 --> 01:02:25.857
For sure.

1070
01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:28.059
Everyone. now look. in the
seven years I've been released

1071
01:02:28.093 --> 01:02:29.728
from prison. we've been more
successful

1072
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.829
than most motherfuckers do in a
lifetime.

1073
01:02:32.564 --> 01:02:34.966
Now. I'm not just talking
about the street oglers.

1074
01:02:34.999 --> 01:02:37.535
The entertainment. the
fashion. the restaurants.

1075
01:02:37.568 --> 01:02:40.004
like this one here. Mr.
Cerrone's blessed me with.

1076
01:02:40.772 --> 01:02:43.375
Angel has been instrumental in
all of it.

1077
01:02:44.575 --> 01:02:46.510
Now. this is Angel's night.

1078
01:02:46.544 --> 01:02:50.848
but none of this could've
happened without all of you.

1079
01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:53.551
You're my brothers. you're my
sister

1080
01:02:53.584 --> 01:02:55.386
and I owe all you motherfuckers.

1081
01:02:56.653 --> 01:02:57.655
- Family.
- Family.

1082
01:03:00.892 --> 01:03:02.727
Now let's get to the
everything.

1083
01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.795
Come on. Dutch. let's take a
picture.

1084
01:03:03.828 --> 01:03:05.763
Oh. you know I don't
like being in no pictures.

1085
01:03:05.796 --> 01:03:07.131
Come on. just one.

1086
01:03:07.164 --> 01:03:08.466
Come on. I'll take it.

1087
01:03:10.769 --> 01:03:11.970
Come on. Dutch.

1088
01:03:17.075 --> 01:03:18.743
Ay. how was that party?

1089
01:03:20.412 --> 01:03:21.747
Fire.

1090
01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:22.714
It was lit.

1091
01:03:22.747 --> 01:03:25.117
Lit. Angel brought
out all the bad bitches.

1092
01:03:25.149 --> 01:03:25.983
All of them.

1093
01:03:26.017 --> 01:03:26.984
All of them.

1094
01:03:27.017 --> 01:03:29.053
Man. the traffic on
the highway was so bad.

1095
01:03:29.086 --> 01:03:31.922
I ain't going up to Bmore no
time soon.

1096
01:03:31.955 --> 01:03:34.526
Shut yo ass up. if it
wasn't for them crab cakes

1097
01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:36.595
you ordered. we would've
been there on time.

1098
01:03:36.627 --> 01:03:37.595
Uh. there go the truth.

1099
01:03:37.629 --> 01:03:39.664
Man. I wasn't the only
one eating crab cakes.

1100
01:03:39.696 --> 01:03:41.867
You had crab cakes. too.

1101
01:03:41.899 --> 01:03:43.602
You know she expect the
whole family to be there.

1102
01:03:43.635 --> 01:03:45.636
She gonna kick your ass.

1103
01:03:47.638 --> 01:03:50.107
Hey. fellas. what's happening?

1104
01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.008
Where's Dutch?

1105
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:54.746
Roc. let me talk to you.

1106
01:04:01.019 --> 01:04:03.888
You know what one of
the most dangerous parts

1107
01:04:03.921 --> 01:04:05.490
of our business is?

1108
01:04:06.158 --> 01:04:08.527
It's not aiming too high that
you miss it.

1109
01:04:09.861 --> 01:04:11.797
it's aiming too low that you
reach it.

1110
01:04:12.897 --> 01:04:16.135
Buona fortuna. lots of good
fortune.

1111
01:04:17.669 --> 01:04:19.703
I wanna make you rich.

1112
01:04:19.736 --> 01:04:22.773
I want you to come with me
and be part of my family.

1113
01:04:22.807 --> 01:04:27.812
Dutch. he's nothing
without me. he's washed up.

1114
01:04:28.146 --> 01:04:30.481
What. Dutch. that's my
brother.

1115
01:04:30.515 --> 01:04:31.783
We been down for life.

1116
01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:34.787
Loyalty. you feel me?

1117
01:04:35.854 --> 01:04:38.089
Loyalty. I love that.

1118
01:04:39.723 --> 01:04:43.995
I just hope that Dutch cares
about your little clique

1119
01:04:44.028 --> 01:04:45.430
just as much as you do.

1120
01:04:47.499 --> 01:04:48.167
Do you feel me?

1121
01:04:56.039 --> 01:04:57.008
Think about it.

1122
01:05:02.814 --> 01:05:04.516
I don't trust them Italians.

1123
01:05:05.517 --> 01:05:07.719
Dutch think Frank had something
to do with that stolen car

1124
01:05:07.752 --> 01:05:09.188
that y'all got locked up in.

1125
01:05:10.722 --> 01:05:11.756
I know what Dutch think.

1126
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:14.058
but I don't think they
had nothing to do with it.

1127
01:05:14.091 --> 01:05:16.060
But Dutch is always on point.
so...

1128
01:05:18.863 --> 01:05:21.566
Fake ass Tony Montana
Italians.

1129
01:05:23.734 --> 01:05:25.937
That nigga said Tony Montana.

1130
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:27.973
At this juncture. the
prosecutor has painted

1131
01:05:28.006 --> 01:05:31.176
an incredibly unflattering
picture of you to the jury.

1132
01:05:31.209 --> 01:05:33.245
Now mind you. it has
nothing to do with the case

1133
01:05:33.278 --> 01:05:35.080
and I'll cover it in my closing.

1134
01:05:35.113 --> 01:05:37.281
but we have to put on a
defense and we'd be idiots

1135
01:05:37.314 --> 01:05:39.850
to think that we can unring that
bell.

1136
01:05:39.883 --> 01:05:41.519
And we not idiots?

1137
01:05:41.553 --> 01:05:43.922
I go out of my way not
to look like an idiot.

1138
01:05:43.955 --> 01:05:46.258
So it would be good for you
to have someone speak well

1139
01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:47.926
on your behalf.

1140
01:05:47.959 --> 01:05:50.828
If not. change the perception
that Jacobs has presented

1141
01:05:50.861 --> 01:05:53.097
but at least question it.

1142
01:05:53.964 --> 01:05:54.832
Right.

1143
01:06:02.106 --> 01:06:05.209
Is there anyone that can
say good things about you?

1144
01:06:05.243 --> 01:06:08.080
Dozens. but they're all dead
or in jail.

1145
01:06:09.781 --> 01:06:10.749
That's not good.

1146
01:06:11.582 --> 01:06:15.854
No childhood friends. impartial
third parties. girlfriends?

1147
01:06:16.787 --> 01:06:17.789
No.

1148
01:06:17.823 --> 01:06:20.025
No significant
other of any kind?

1149
01:06:20.758 --> 01:06:23.894
In my lifetime. Ms. Nichols.
I've had my share of women.

1150
01:06:23.928 --> 01:06:26.196
but no. I've never been in a
relationship.

1151
01:06:26.229 --> 01:06:27.899
- No?
- No.

1152
01:06:32.102 --> 01:06:34.271
Jacobs won't be done with
putting on his witnesses

1153
01:06:34.305 --> 01:06:37.309
until the middle of next
week. so give it some thought.

1154
01:06:38.276 --> 01:06:39.344
Thank you.

1155
01:06:39.377 --> 01:06:41.547
Sure. I'll see you tomorrow.

1156
01:06:42.914 --> 01:06:43.781
Yeah.

1157
01:06:45.082 --> 01:06:47.051
Dutch. hey. come on over here.

1158
01:06:47.084 --> 01:06:49.153
Ladies. this is the owner.

1159
01:06:49.187 --> 01:06:50.221
- Hi.
- Hey.

1160
01:06:50.254 --> 01:06:51.089
Give us a minute.

1161
01:06:51.122 --> 01:06:51.990
Have a seat.

1162
01:06:55.059 --> 01:06:56.961
I love what you did to this
place.

1163
01:06:56.995 --> 01:06:57.896
Thanks.

1164
01:06:57.930 --> 01:06:59.931
But I have been hearing some
rumblings.

1165
01:06:59.964 --> 01:07:01.900
Yeah. what sort of rumblings?

1166
01:07:01.932 --> 01:07:05.102
Frank thinks that the
restaurant should be given

1167
01:07:05.135 --> 01:07:06.338
to someone in the family.

1168
01:07:07.138 --> 01:07:09.641
Well. I'm like family with Mr.
Cerrone.

1169
01:07:09.673 --> 01:07:13.010
So Frank could go see him
if he has a problem with it.

1170
01:07:13.044 --> 01:07:15.113
I don't have a horse in this
race.

1171
01:07:15.146 --> 01:07:17.281
I just wish you should
give me a little something.

1172
01:07:18.082 --> 01:07:20.151
Yeah. yeah. I'll cop
you a bottle of champagne.

1173
01:07:20.184 --> 01:07:21.017
What kind you drink?

1174
01:07:21.051 --> 01:07:24.055
That's not what I'm talking
about.

1175
01:07:25.189 --> 01:07:28.193
You know what I'm talking about.

1176
01:07:28.225 --> 01:07:31.229
Give me a little info
on one of your rivals.

1177
01:07:31.261 --> 01:07:33.030
it'll make me look good.

1178
01:07:33.064 --> 01:07:36.033
Yeah. well I don't snitch
on anyone. anywhere. anytime

1179
01:07:36.066 --> 01:07:37.702
or under any circumstance.

1180
01:07:39.037 --> 01:07:40.672
You might wanna rethink that.

1181
01:07:42.406 --> 01:07:44.977
Just did. the answer's still
no.

1182
01:07:45.943 --> 01:07:46.812
You take care.

1183
01:07:54.051 --> 01:07:55.287
Y'all went. what?

1184
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:02.793
I got one and a pimp.

1185
01:08:03.627 --> 01:08:07.832
Hello. nuh-uh. Tamika. no.
no not today. okay. girl.

1186
01:08:07.865 --> 01:08:09.100
I have money on this game.

1187
01:08:09.868 --> 01:08:13.304
And you over there eye
fucking dude. Tamika.

1188
01:08:13.336 --> 01:08:14.372
I'll be right back.

1189
01:08:16.274 --> 01:08:17.142
There she go.

1190
01:08:20.778 --> 01:08:22.312
Come on. Nina. you gonna pay or
play?

1191
01:08:22.346 --> 01:08:23.415
I ain't got all day.

1192
01:08:23.448 --> 01:08:25.115
How am I gonna play?

1193
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:27.252
I mean. you see my partner ran
off hoeing.

1194
01:08:31.756 --> 01:08:33.223
I could play.

1195
01:08:33.257 --> 01:08:34.192
Come again?

1196
01:08:34.225 --> 01:08:36.662
I can play until your
partner comes back.

1197
01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.296
What's up. boss?

1198
01:08:42.065 --> 01:08:44.035
Sure. if he's forfeiting.

1199
01:08:49.406 --> 01:08:52.444
So I got five and a possible.

1200
01:08:52.476 --> 01:08:53.811
What you got?

1201
01:08:53.845 --> 01:08:54.945
I'm sorry. excuse me?

1202
01:08:57.114 --> 01:08:58.382
How many do you have?

1203
01:09:01.084 --> 01:09:02.953
Oh. yeah. I got two.

1204
01:09:05.757 --> 01:09:06.925
Put us down for eight.

1205
01:09:07.659 --> 01:09:10.429
Eight out the gate.
somebody's feeling lucky.

1206
01:09:13.864 --> 01:09:16.734
Thank you. nice doing business
with you.

1207
01:09:22.272 --> 01:09:23.141
Seriously?

1208
01:09:25.443 --> 01:09:27.912
Didn't you just see me play all
hearts?

1209
01:09:27.945 --> 01:09:29.481
I thought you said you could
play.

1210
01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:32.017
My fault.

1211
01:09:34.217 --> 01:09:36.821
It's been fun. but I have to
go.

1212
01:09:38.455 --> 01:09:39.757
Stop. come on. Nina.

1213
01:09:43.461 --> 01:09:45.363
Yo. how much she lose?

1214
01:09:45.395 --> 01:09:46.263
500.

1215
01:09:49.266 --> 01:09:49.900
I don't know where he is.

1216
01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:50.901
I don't wanna fucking wait.

1217
01:09:50.936 --> 01:09:52.403
What are we. a couple
of jerk offs over here

1218
01:09:52.436 --> 01:09:53.537
- waiting for...
- There he is.

1219
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:56.774
Hey. it's the fucking Ly
brothers. Hugly and Ugly.

1220
01:09:56.807 --> 01:09:59.077
Ha-ha. funny. come on. let's
go.

1221
01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:01.312
I went to see Dutch like you
sent me.

1222
01:10:01.345 --> 01:10:03.515
Yeah. he hands me a bag of
money.

1223
01:10:03.547 --> 01:10:04.481
I said. what's this?

1224
01:10:04.515 --> 01:10:05.784
He says it's a start.

1225
01:10:05.816 --> 01:10:07.017
A start. I say.

1226
01:10:07.052 --> 01:10:09.487
Let me tell you something. you
stupid black son of a bitch.

1227
01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.055
you know what your problem is?

1228
01:10:11.087 --> 01:10:13.190
You took what another man
earned.

1229
01:10:13.223 --> 01:10:14.359
You tried to build your
foundation

1230
01:10:14.391 --> 01:10:15.926
on another man's reputation.

1231
01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:20.198
I told them this. you forgot
the one thing in our business.

1232
01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:22.800
You live and die on you and you
alone.

1233
01:10:22.833 --> 01:10:24.903
I mean. sure I know he's
crazy. a little more ruthless.

1234
01:10:24.936 --> 01:10:27.272
he had to be. I'll give him
that. okay.

1235
01:10:27.305 --> 01:10:28.439
But he plays by his own rules.

1236
01:10:28.471 --> 01:10:30.474
He doesn't play by our rules.

1237
01:10:30.507 --> 01:10:32.209
He pisses me off.

1238
01:10:32.243 --> 01:10:36.047
So then I told him. now
I got you by the balls.

1239
01:10:36.079 --> 01:10:38.182
And I'm gonna keep squeezing and
squeezing

1240
01:10:38.216 --> 01:10:39.484
until I get fucking blood.

1241
01:10:39.516 --> 01:10:41.051
And then I'm gonna crush you

1242
01:10:41.084 --> 01:10:43.221
like the piss ass nigger that
you are.

1243
01:10:43.253 --> 01:10:44.388
And he just stands there. he
looks at me.

1244
01:10:44.422 --> 01:10:46.223
he doesn't say anything. he's a
chump.

1245
01:10:46.257 --> 01:10:47.525
You done?

1246
01:10:47.557 --> 01:10:48.359
Yeah.

1247
01:10:48.391 --> 01:10:49.526
What is your fucking problem.
huh?

1248
01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.596
Those guys make us a ton of
fucking dough. all right.

1249
01:10:51.628 --> 01:10:54.531
Nobody's gonna connect them
to us. so just re-fucking-lax

1250
01:10:54.565 --> 01:10:55.700
and forget about it.

1251
01:10:55.732 --> 01:10:57.869
It's a lot of fucking money
and it goes in my pocket.

1252
01:10:57.901 --> 01:10:59.037
What's your fucking problem.
huh?

1253
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.904
What the fuck is your problem?

1254
01:10:59.937 --> 01:11:00.739
You're my fucking
problem!

1255
01:11:00.771 --> 01:11:01.439
- Fuck you!
- All right. all right.

1256
01:11:01.472 --> 01:11:02.140
. all right.

1257
01:11:02.172 --> 01:11:05.108
That's it. finito. all right.

1258
01:11:05.141 --> 01:11:06.543
If this keeps up. we're gonna
sit down

1259
01:11:06.577 --> 01:11:09.513
with the old man. all right.

1260
01:11:09.547 --> 01:11:11.382
You're gonna get slapped on the
wrist. maybe more than that.

1261
01:11:11.414 --> 01:11:12.382
all right. Frank?

1262
01:11:12.415 --> 01:11:14.185
You ain't going to see
him again. all right.

1263
01:11:14.217 --> 01:11:15.485
You don't deal with them anymore

1264
01:11:15.519 --> 01:11:17.922
because I can't fucking trust
you.

1265
01:11:17.954 --> 01:11:20.057
Hey. I'm talking to
you all right. capiche?

1266
01:11:20.757 --> 01:11:23.093
. enough.
now come on. let's go.

1267
01:11:23.127 --> 01:11:25.029
You're gonna fuck this up for
us!

1268
01:11:25.061 --> 01:11:26.296
All right. stop. stop!

1269
01:11:26.329 --> 01:11:28.131
Stop.

1270
01:11:28.164 --> 01:11:28.966
I'm not riding with him.

1271
01:11:28.998 --> 01:11:30.868
I'll ride in my own car. fuck
it.

1272
01:11:33.971 --> 01:11:37.441
Hey. Roc. ain't Aisha supposed
to be having the baby soon?

1273
01:11:37.475 --> 01:11:38.510
Yeah. any day.

1274
01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:44.982
Ay. ain't that about your
fourth. fifth baby with Aisha?

1275
01:11:45.016 --> 01:11:46.284
You need to get your tubes tied.

1276
01:11:46.316 --> 01:11:48.086
Shut up. nigga.

1277
01:11:48.119 --> 01:11:48.953
What's up. baby girl?

1278
01:11:48.985 --> 01:11:50.988
Hi. where's Dutch?

1279
01:11:51.021 --> 01:11:53.190
I got somebody who wants to talk
to him.

1280
01:11:53.223 --> 01:11:54.492
Who?

1281
01:11:54.525 --> 01:11:56.394
William Brent.

1282
01:11:56.427 --> 01:11:57.896
And who the fuck is that?

1283
01:11:57.928 --> 01:11:58.596
Bill Blass.

1284
01:11:59.997 --> 01:12:01.499
What he want?

1285
01:12:01.531 --> 01:12:02.400
Trabajo?

1286
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:07.939
All right. fuck it. send him
in.

1287
01:12:07.971 --> 01:12:08.639
Yo!

1288
01:12:11.542 --> 01:12:13.444
Oh. there he is.

1289
01:12:13.476 --> 01:12:15.346
What's up. Bill. go on have a
seat.

1290
01:12:16.713 --> 01:12:17.948
What's going on. man?

1291
01:12:18.748 --> 01:12:23.520
Hey. guys. I really hate that
I'm here

1292
01:12:23.553 --> 01:12:27.958
but my family and I are really
down on our luck right now.

1293
01:12:29.025 --> 01:12:34.131
And I'm just looking for
any type of work right now

1294
01:12:34.164 --> 01:12:34.999
if you have any.

1295
01:12:36.232 --> 01:12:38.535
All right. what you think.
Roc?

1296
01:12:40.137 --> 01:12:41.106
Give us a minute.

1297
01:12:42.272 --> 01:12:47.279
All right.

1298
01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.548
Who he fuck with?

1299
01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:51.917
Joe from Newark.

1300
01:12:53.217 --> 01:12:54.619
He on the run from the feds.

1301
01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.489
Man. fuck it.

1302
01:12:58.521 --> 01:13:00.190
Just have him take Bliss' spot.

1303
01:13:01.257 --> 01:13:02.126
Yeah.

1304
01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:04.729
All right. let's
move. let's make it happen.

1305
01:13:04.762 --> 01:13:06.397
Let's make it happen. let's
move.

1306
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:07.263
- All right.
- All right.

1307
01:13:07.297 --> 01:13:10.400
On another note. nigga. is you
sterile?

1308
01:13:10.434 --> 01:13:12.070
'Cause you ain't got no kids.

1309
01:13:12.102 --> 01:13:13.038
Fuck you.

1310
01:13:18.775 --> 01:13:20.510
Susan said you
wanted to see me. sir.

1311
01:13:20.543 --> 01:13:21.511
Nina. come in.

1312
01:13:21.544 --> 01:13:23.347
I wanted to introduce
you to our new client

1313
01:13:23.381 --> 01:13:25.383
I was telling you about. Mr.
James.

1314
01:13:25.415 --> 01:13:26.284
Mr. James.

1315
01:13:27.418 --> 01:13:29.220
You can call me Bernard.

1316
01:13:30.087 --> 01:13:31.522
I'm sorry. I've gotta take
this.

1317
01:13:31.555 --> 01:13:34.191
You guys keep talking. I'll be
right back.

1318
01:13:37.395 --> 01:13:39.397
I thought your name was Dutch.

1319
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:40.397
Nickname.

1320
01:13:40.431 --> 01:13:43.201
So how do you
get Dutch from Bernard?

1321
01:13:43.234 --> 01:13:44.235
It's a long story.

1322
01:13:45.369 --> 01:13:46.704
So the Cerrone Social Club is
one

1323
01:13:46.736 --> 01:13:48.506
of the six restaurants that you
own?

1324
01:13:48.538 --> 01:13:50.742
No. but I manage it for a
friend.

1325
01:13:50.775 --> 01:13:53.311
You're not exactly the person
you pretend to be. are you?

1326
01:13:53.343 --> 01:13:54.544
Look. I said I could play
cards

1327
01:13:54.578 --> 01:13:55.513
till your friend came back.

1328
01:13:55.546 --> 01:13:57.147
I didn't say I was good at it.

1329
01:13:58.248 --> 01:13:59.383
Nice. go ahead.

1330
01:13:59.417 --> 01:14:01.718
One. two. head body. head
body. there you go. come on.

1331
01:14:01.752 --> 01:14:03.654
Come on. come on.

1332
01:14:03.686 --> 01:14:04.588
Body. body.

1333
01:14:04.622 --> 01:14:05.522
There you go. hit it. hit it...

1334
01:14:05.556 --> 01:14:07.557
Don't listen to him. he don't
know shit.

1335
01:14:07.591 --> 01:14:09.293
Oh. Tony. veni ca.

1336
01:14:09.325 --> 01:14:10.293
Hey.

1337
01:14:10.327 --> 01:14:11.262
Kid looks good.

1338
01:14:11.294 --> 01:14:13.096
He does. you'll
fuck that up.

1339
01:14:13.129 --> 01:14:14.464
I trained him myself.

1340
01:14:14.498 --> 01:14:16.200
I could see that.

1341
01:14:16.232 --> 01:14:18.302
Thank you for coming
down here to sit with me.

1342
01:14:18.334 --> 01:14:21.105
No problem. for reasons
passed understanding.

1343
01:14:21.137 --> 01:14:23.207
I'm out picking up a few
things for the old lady

1344
01:14:23.239 --> 01:14:25.376
tomorrow being our wedding
anniversary.

1345
01:14:25.409 --> 01:14:28.112
Buona fortuna. did your wife
get the flowers I sent her?

1346
01:14:28.145 --> 01:14:30.415
Yes. by the way. that was
an incredibly nice gesture.

1347
01:14:30.448 --> 01:14:32.417
You made me look bad. you fuck.

1348
01:14:35.386 --> 01:14:37.555
I didn't think it was
appropriate

1349
01:14:37.587 --> 01:14:40.090
to talk to you about this over
the phone.

1350
01:14:40.123 --> 01:14:41.591
What are we talking about?

1351
01:14:41.624 --> 01:14:44.494
I'm talking about our
street holdings here.

1352
01:14:44.528 --> 01:14:45.363
Dutch?

1353
01:14:45.395 --> 01:14:47.197
Yeah. Dutch.

1354
01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:49.166
Come on. we all know these
people are inferior to us.

1355
01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:50.600
Things ain't being ran right.

1356
01:14:50.633 --> 01:14:53.404
No. no. things are being
ran very fucking right

1357
01:14:53.436 --> 01:14:54.805
from where I'm sitting.

1358
01:14:54.838 --> 01:14:57.641
And the reason I know this
is my accountant told me so.

1359
01:14:58.376 --> 01:15:00.378
And just so there's no
more fucking confusion

1360
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:02.245
about where I'm sitting on this.

1361
01:15:02.279 --> 01:15:03.647
the next time you wanna get
ahold of me.

1362
01:15:03.681 --> 01:15:05.683
you call me on a fucking phone.

1363
01:15:08.519 --> 01:15:09.587
You mean you're gonna take the
side

1364
01:15:09.619 --> 01:15:12.623
of that bottom feeding
nigger over one of your own?

1365
01:15:23.601 --> 01:15:24.502
Nice work. Lou.

1366
01:15:26.736 --> 01:15:28.739
That's it. head body. head body.

1367
01:15:28.771 --> 01:15:30.607
Come on. keep up that footwork.

1368
01:15:35.145 --> 01:15:36.580
You come here a lot?

1369
01:15:36.614 --> 01:15:37.848
A few times. a lot of doctors.

1370
01:15:37.882 --> 01:15:40.184
lawyers and financial analysts
come here.

1371
01:15:40.217 --> 01:15:43.154
I get it. rich people like
to hang with rich people.

1372
01:15:43.186 --> 01:15:43.854
Well. I ain't gonna lie.

1373
01:15:43.887 --> 01:15:46.189
I enjoy the harvest of my labor.

1374
01:15:46.222 --> 01:15:48.225
But to be honest. all this is a
result

1375
01:15:48.258 --> 01:15:49.694
of wanting it for someone else.

1376
01:15:50.727 --> 01:15:52.363
Okay. I'm confused.

1377
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:57.168
My father walked out of my
mom's life before I was born.

1378
01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.636
She went hungry many a day
to feed and provide for me.

1379
01:15:59.669 --> 01:16:03.240
So I promised myself when I
got old enough that if able

1380
01:16:03.274 --> 01:16:06.244
I would give her everything
that my father should have.

1381
01:16:06.276 --> 01:16:08.913
So it's not a holiday. birthday
or any day that goes by

1382
01:16:08.945 --> 01:16:10.314
where I don't try to give her
the best

1383
01:16:10.346 --> 01:16:11.815
that life has to offer.

1384
01:16:11.848 --> 01:16:13.717
Well. your mother is very
fortunate

1385
01:16:13.751 --> 01:16:15.919
because I don't think
there's a woman alive

1386
01:16:15.953 --> 01:16:18.522
that wouldn't wish for
that quality in a man.

1387
01:16:18.556 --> 01:16:21.459
Well. I'm not trying to
win an award or nothing.

1388
01:16:23.293 --> 01:16:25.162
You sure are easy to talk to.

1389
01:16:26.564 --> 01:16:27.499
So are you.

1390
01:17:05.769 --> 01:17:08.338
You have the lawyers for
Martin and Kendall at noon.

1391
01:17:08.372 --> 01:17:09.507
That meeting's gonna run long.

1392
01:17:09.539 --> 01:17:10.774
so will you order us something
to eat?

1393
01:17:10.807 --> 01:17:12.275
Sure. what do you feel like?

1394
01:17:12.309 --> 01:17:13.543
Whatever you had yesterday is
fine.

1395
01:17:13.577 --> 01:17:14.779
Can we try something
different?

1396
01:17:14.811 --> 01:17:16.881
I had lasagna. you had
spaghetti.

1397
01:17:16.913 --> 01:17:18.481
I had a bad experience with
it.

1398
01:17:18.515 --> 01:17:19.348
Why?

1399
01:17:19.382 --> 01:17:20.316
Well. they delivered the
meatballs

1400
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:22.419
but they forget the
spaghetti and the sauce.

1401
01:17:22.453 --> 01:17:24.222
They clearly have zero
compassion

1402
01:17:24.254 --> 01:17:26.390
for young starving assistants.

1403
01:17:26.422 --> 01:17:27.290
They took care of it. right?

1404
01:17:27.324 --> 01:17:28.192
Yeah. but I was hungry.

1405
01:17:28.225 --> 01:17:29.526
By the time they brought the
spaghetti.

1406
01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:30.895
I had already eaten the
meatballs.

1407
01:17:30.927 --> 01:17:32.262
That must've sucked.

1408
01:17:32.296 --> 01:17:33.263
Tell me about it.

1409
01:17:33.297 --> 01:17:35.533
Okay. well we won't
be ordering from them.

1410
01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:37.769
Hey.

1411
01:17:38.769 --> 01:17:39.637
Hi.

1412
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:43.208
I forgot to tell you. Mr.
James is here.

1413
01:17:44.275 --> 01:17:45.643
What stopped you?

1414
01:17:45.676 --> 01:17:46.744
The meatballs.

1415
01:17:46.776 --> 01:17:47.845
Thank you. Sam.

1416
01:17:53.316 --> 01:17:54.718
I'm sorry.

1417
01:17:54.752 --> 01:17:56.521
Why. did you do something
wrong?

1418
01:17:57.254 --> 01:18:00.423
I didn't call you. but
by no means does that

1419
01:18:00.457 --> 01:18:02.959
reflect the time that we spent
together.

1420
01:18:02.993 --> 01:18:04.629
It was incredible.

1421
01:18:04.662 --> 01:18:09.633
Yeah. it was.

1422
01:18:11.802 --> 01:18:12.804
Excuse me.

1423
01:18:14.471 --> 01:18:15.606
Nina. what are you trying to
tell me

1424
01:18:15.638 --> 01:18:17.574
that you're not telling me?

1425
01:18:17.607 --> 01:18:19.276
I liked you from the moment I
met you.

1426
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:20.544
but I can't do this.

1427
01:18:22.413 --> 01:18:24.515
I spoke with Tamika and
she let me know what you do

1428
01:18:24.547 --> 01:18:26.783
beyond the restaurants and
stores.

1429
01:18:26.816 --> 01:18:28.752
When I told you my brother died.

1430
01:18:28.785 --> 01:18:31.422
he was murdered by a drug
dealer.

1431
01:18:31.454 --> 01:18:32.922
So you think I'm gonna end up
like him

1432
01:18:32.955 --> 01:18:34.425
and you gonna lose me. too.

1433
01:18:36.793 --> 01:18:38.561
You're far too smart to get
caught up

1434
01:18:38.595 --> 01:18:39.763
the way my brother did.

1435
01:18:42.365 --> 01:18:47.004
It's about respect. respect
for his life. his memory.

1436
01:18:47.872 --> 01:18:50.742
I can't see myself living
off what he died for.

1437
01:18:52.676 --> 01:18:53.745
I can respect that.

1438
01:18:58.047 --> 01:18:59.716
And I probably shouldn't say
this.

1439
01:18:59.749 --> 01:19:01.551
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

1440
01:19:01.584 --> 01:19:03.954
You will never ever get over me.

1441
01:19:04.855 --> 01:19:07.492
I was meant for you and
you were meant for me.

1442
01:19:10.127 --> 01:19:10.961
How do you know that?

1443
01:19:10.994 --> 01:19:12.563
Nobody knows that much.

1444
01:19:14.131 --> 01:19:15.999
I know 'cause I know what love
is.

1445
01:19:30.114 --> 01:19:34.552
Mrs. Cerrone. this is Bernard
James. a business associate

1446
01:19:34.584 --> 01:19:36.553
and very good friend of your
husband's.

1447
01:19:44.561 --> 01:19:49.000
Rose. Tony was like a
brother to me. I'm so sorry.

1448
01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:50.802
Whatever you need.

1449
01:20:06.482 --> 01:20:08.386
Reach out to Detective O'Neal.

1450
01:20:08.418 --> 01:20:11.154
I want this boy put to
bed as soon as possible.

1451
01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.397
Bill Blass. you was just gonna
leave

1452
01:20:20.431 --> 01:20:25.436
without saying goodbye.
after we gave you a job?

1453
01:20:25.769 --> 01:20:26.870
Ow. fuck!

1454
01:20:28.872 --> 01:20:33.543
Look. guys. it's not what you
think it is.

1455
01:20:33.577 --> 01:20:34.412
Oh yeah?

1456
01:20:34.445 --> 01:20:35.113
No.

1457
01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:37.580
What is it?

1458
01:20:37.614 --> 01:20:39.649
You guys saw how shit was
going down.

1459
01:20:40.516 --> 01:20:43.686
I was gonna give the money
back. I was only holding onto it

1460
01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:48.458
in case there was a raid
or shit got complicated.

1461
01:20:48.492 --> 01:20:49.693
It's true.

1462
01:20:52.663 --> 01:20:53.531
Yeah.

1463
01:20:54.832 --> 01:20:55.999
Come on. guys. you gotta
believe me.

1464
01:20:56.033 --> 01:20:56.901
Man. shut up.

1465
01:20:56.934 --> 01:20:57.802
Hold on.

1466
01:21:01.038 --> 01:21:01.906
Yo.

1467
01:21:05.742 --> 01:21:06.944
All right.

1468
01:21:06.976 --> 01:21:09.212
Ay. y'all let Dutch
know whatever he needs.

1469
01:21:09.245 --> 01:21:12.182
whatever it is. I got him.
whatever.

1470
01:21:12.216 --> 01:21:14.685
Yeah. I know. Dutch told us.

1471
01:21:14.717 --> 01:21:16.052
He got a job for you.

1472
01:21:16.086 --> 01:21:17.488
Only you can do it. Bill.

1473
01:21:18.154 --> 01:21:20.457
Well. can I at least get
dressed first?

1474
01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:23.694
Of course. Dutch has a
special outfit for you.

1475
01:21:23.726 --> 01:21:25.529
Like I said. anything for
Dutch.

1476
01:21:29.098 --> 01:21:30.501
What the fuck is that?

1477
01:21:30.534 --> 01:21:31.602
It's an option vest.

1478
01:21:33.203 --> 01:21:35.506
You got two options.

1479
01:21:35.538 --> 01:21:39.108
Either you put this vest
on that Dutch made for you

1480
01:21:39.141 --> 01:21:42.846
and you take some people
out along with yourself.

1481
01:21:42.879 --> 01:21:45.682
Option two. we kill your whole
family.

1482
01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:48.486
What the fuck you wanna do?

1483
01:21:48.519 --> 01:21:51.588
Your wife. your daughter.
your mother. your dad.

1484
01:21:51.622 --> 01:21:52.856
your grandfather. your cousin

1485
01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:56.727
and bubblefuck. we killing
everybody.

1486
01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.529
Fuck. I think I just pissed
myself.

1487
01:21:58.561 --> 01:21:59.963
Fine. I'll fucking do it.

1488
01:22:01.198 --> 01:22:02.900
I'll put the fucking vest on.

1489
01:22:02.932 --> 01:22:07.204
I thought you might
say that. wise choice.

1490
01:22:11.208 --> 01:22:13.544
Yo. that nigga Roc is
really having another baby.

1491
01:22:13.577 --> 01:22:15.646
Man. didn't Aisha say it
wasn't gonna be no nother one?

1492
01:22:15.678 --> 01:22:18.781
Ha. Roc's a little bitch.

1493
01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:33.129
Secure all the exits.
we're going upstairs.

1494
01:22:33.163 --> 01:22:34.031
Move!

1495
01:22:43.906 --> 01:22:46.744
Yeah. yeah bro. it's a boy.

1496
01:22:46.776 --> 01:22:47.645
Big boy.

1497
01:22:48.779 --> 01:22:53.684
Rahmin Abdul. also known
as Roc. you're under arrest.

1498
01:22:55.619 --> 01:22:56.754
It's over.

1499
01:22:56.787 --> 01:22:58.989
You have the right to remain
silent.

1500
01:22:59.021 --> 01:23:00.056
I just had a baby.

1501
01:23:00.089 --> 01:23:00.923
- Let's go.
- I just had a baby.

1502
01:23:00.958 --> 01:23:03.160
If you give up that
right...

1503
01:23:06.663 --> 01:23:07.698
What the fuck?

1504
01:23:07.730 --> 01:23:08.798
Fuck he smiling at?

1505
01:23:16.172 --> 01:23:18.041
What they call it when you don't
wanna have the baby no more

1506
01:23:18.074 --> 01:23:20.209
and you get your nuts clipped?

1507
01:23:20.243 --> 01:23:22.913
The snip. that's a vasectomy.

1508
01:23:22.945 --> 01:23:23.780
Vasectomy?

1509
01:23:23.814 --> 01:23:28.017
Yeah...

1510
01:23:32.623 --> 01:23:33.290
Come on!

1511
01:24:22.372 --> 01:24:25.008
Get a couple bottles to
table 12. no sparklies. though.

1512
01:24:25.042 --> 01:24:25.943
Keep it low key.

1513
01:24:29.812 --> 01:24:34.150
Dutch. bruh. Zoom is dead.

1514
01:24:34.184 --> 01:24:37.287
and they got Angel on lockdown.
the feds.

1515
01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:39.056
Roc and Angel ain't gonna
flip.

1516
01:24:49.266 --> 01:24:52.770
Detective. you claim that
Mr. Bernard James is the cause

1517
01:24:52.802 --> 01:24:55.004
for your early retirement.

1518
01:24:55.038 --> 01:24:58.776
Yes. he ordered that the
27th Precinct be blown up.

1519
01:24:59.476 --> 01:25:02.846
He sent a psycho into the
station strapped with C4.

1520
01:25:02.878 --> 01:25:04.948
He blew himself up and my fellow
officers.

1521
01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:08.151
Objections. your honor. calls
for facts not in evidence.

1522
01:25:08.185 --> 01:25:09.053
Overruled.

1523
01:25:09.086 --> 01:25:09.919
Exception.

1524
01:25:09.953 --> 01:25:10.787
Noted.

1525
01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.457
Now. Mr. O'Neal. how can you
be sure

1526
01:25:13.489 --> 01:25:16.092
that Mr. Bernard James
was indeed responsible

1527
01:25:16.126 --> 01:25:17.360
for that explosion?

1528
01:25:17.394 --> 01:25:19.762
The suicide bomber's
name was William Brent.

1529
01:25:19.796 --> 01:25:21.330
He also went by Bill Blass.

1530
01:25:21.364 --> 01:25:23.701
He was a small-time hustler.

1531
01:25:23.734 --> 01:25:25.169
He sent his wife a letter the
morning

1532
01:25:25.202 --> 01:25:26.837
before he entered the building.

1533
01:25:29.338 --> 01:25:30.940
Is this the letter?

1534
01:25:30.973 --> 01:25:32.042
Objection.

1535
01:25:32.074 --> 01:25:33.677
Counsel. get up here now.

1536
01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:41.450
I'm very surprised.

1537
01:25:41.485 --> 01:25:43.954
The defense has never received
a copy of this letter.

1538
01:25:43.986 --> 01:25:47.091
Your honor. we received this
this morning by the witness.

1539
01:25:47.123 --> 01:25:48.825
You knew he'd be introducing
this letter

1540
01:25:48.859 --> 01:25:49.927
as your witness prep.

1541
01:25:49.959 --> 01:25:50.860
I'll allow it.

1542
01:25:50.895 --> 01:25:52.930
He has a duty to turn over all
evidence.

1543
01:25:52.962 --> 01:25:54.263
I said I'll allow it.

1544
01:25:54.297 --> 01:25:55.232
Your honor.

1545
01:25:55.265 --> 01:25:57.168
Counsel. I made my
ruling. step back now.

1546
01:26:16.787 --> 01:26:20.757
Dear Monique. by the time
you get this. I'll be dead.

1547
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:23.392
but I wanted you to know
that it's because of Dutch.

1548
01:26:23.426 --> 01:26:26.296
He said if I don't do what
he says. he's gonna kill you.

1549
01:26:26.329 --> 01:26:29.032
the kids and my whole family.

1550
01:26:29.065 --> 01:26:31.101
So this is my sacrifice.

1551
01:26:31.133 --> 01:26:32.336
I gladly make it. too.

1552
01:26:33.102 --> 01:26:36.405
When you get this. deliver
it to the authorities.

1553
01:26:36.439 --> 01:26:38.475
the DA or someone like that.

1554
01:26:38.507 --> 01:26:40.910
Don't give it to no regular cop.
though.

1555
01:26:40.944 --> 01:26:43.280
I love you. pray for my soul.

1556
01:26:43.312 --> 01:26:44.315
Love always. Billy.

1557
01:27:34.897 --> 01:27:35.865
Hey. Michelle.

1558
01:27:35.899 --> 01:27:36.566
You're blessed.

1559
01:27:44.507 --> 01:27:48.178
Your best was good but it
wasn't good enough. accept it.

1560
01:27:48.211 --> 01:27:50.580
The trial isn't over.
you haven't won yet.

1561
01:27:50.614 --> 01:27:52.115
I'll do you a favor.

1562
01:27:52.147 --> 01:27:54.051
I'll take the death penalty off
the table.

1563
01:27:54.083 --> 01:27:55.118
That's your offer?

1564
01:27:55.151 --> 01:27:57.421
Look. I don't wanna
see your client executed.

1565
01:27:57.454 --> 01:28:00.224
I prefer to watch him rot in
prison for the rest of his life

1566
01:28:00.257 --> 01:28:02.526
as a gleaming example for
those who break the law

1567
01:28:02.559 --> 01:28:03.494
on my watch.

1568
01:28:03.526 --> 01:28:05.561
You mean as an example
for financial donors

1569
01:28:05.595 --> 01:28:06.997
in your bid for governor.

1570
01:28:12.068 --> 01:28:13.436
I'll even let you choose the
prison

1571
01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:15.038
where he serves out his life
sentence.

1572
01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:17.341
You haven't met the
elements. I can still win this.

1573
01:28:17.373 --> 01:28:19.342
If not now. then on appeal.

1574
01:28:19.376 --> 01:28:21.144
Unless you become a magician.

1575
01:28:21.177 --> 01:28:22.880
we all know what's gonna happen.

1576
01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:27.581
You have until before
closing arguments tomorrow.

1577
01:28:27.583 --> 01:28:28.985
take that to your client.

1578
01:28:33.690 --> 01:28:35.125
We'll take the next one.

1579
01:29:07.089 --> 01:29:09.126
The jury is split.

1580
01:29:09.159 --> 01:29:12.696
I've been advocating strongly
on behalf of Mr. James.

1581
01:29:12.729 --> 01:29:15.633
So when I flip against him.
everyone else will follow.

1582
01:29:16.598 --> 01:29:17.501
He's toast.

1583
01:29:32.147 --> 01:29:35.084
I asked my judge. Dutch
will never see daylight.

1584
01:29:35.118 --> 01:29:36.220
I promise you that.

1585
01:29:37.654 --> 01:29:40.324
Nobody fucks with me.

1586
01:29:51.735 --> 01:29:54.037
You know you're a
very sexy woman. right?

1587
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:56.140
If I didn't. I would be an
idiot.

1588
01:29:57.373 --> 01:29:59.510
You'll go out your
way not to be an idiot.

1589
01:30:01.744 --> 01:30:03.446
Are you getting enough to eat?

1590
01:30:04.681 --> 01:30:06.083
I was on a diet.

1591
01:30:06.115 --> 01:30:07.184
Exercise?

1592
01:30:07.984 --> 01:30:08.952
I was waiting for you to stop
by

1593
01:30:08.985 --> 01:30:11.755
to see if you wanted to
get in a pickup game.

1594
01:30:11.788 --> 01:30:13.390
You like doing that. don't
you?

1595
01:30:13.422 --> 01:30:14.457
Doing what?

1596
01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:16.025
Pretending things are
worse than what they are.

1597
01:30:16.059 --> 01:30:17.761
Oh. I ain't gotta pretend.

1598
01:30:17.793 --> 01:30:20.997
I'll spend a couple of years
in here and then be executed.

1599
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:24.066
The judge and the jury are
already bought and paid for.

1600
01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:25.502
Can you prove that?

1601
01:30:25.534 --> 01:30:28.037
No. but you'll know
I'm telling the truth

1602
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:29.171
because the man that
bought and paid for it

1603
01:30:29.204 --> 01:30:31.173
will be in court tomorrow.

1604
01:30:31.207 --> 01:30:34.177
He ain't gonna miss the
opportunity to see me burn.

1605
01:30:34.209 --> 01:30:36.046
Then why are they offering
to take the death penalty

1606
01:30:36.079 --> 01:30:38.349
off the table and get
you to choose the prison?

1607
01:30:39.815 --> 01:30:42.019
That's to torture me first.

1608
01:30:42.052 --> 01:30:43.387
It's still a death sentence.

1609
01:30:44.486 --> 01:30:45.521
It's a discreet phone call

1610
01:30:45.555 --> 01:30:48.057
from one prison official to
another.

1611
01:30:48.091 --> 01:30:50.227
Suddenly. a Newark drug
dealer is found dead

1612
01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:51.595
in his cell from suicide.

1613
01:30:51.628 --> 01:30:53.063
Nobody'll question it.

1614
01:30:54.329 --> 01:30:55.798
I'll question it.

1615
01:30:55.832 --> 01:30:57.100
It doesn't matter.

1616
01:30:57.132 --> 01:30:58.401
It'll be like the Freddie Gray
case

1617
01:30:58.435 --> 01:31:00.604
and countless others before me.

1618
01:31:00.637 --> 01:31:02.072
Nobody'll be convicted.

1619
01:31:03.472 --> 01:31:05.641
If you felt that way.
why did you hire me?

1620
01:31:07.342 --> 01:31:08.378
Here Comes the Sun.

1621
01:31:09.745 --> 01:31:11.015
Nina Simone song?

1622
01:31:12.181 --> 01:31:13.050
Somebody told me once

1623
01:31:13.083 --> 01:31:14.785
that song promised a better
tomorrow.

1624
01:31:18.821 --> 01:31:19.757
I'm not done yet.

1625
01:31:39.575 --> 01:31:41.078
You're watching Wake Up New
Jersey.

1626
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.979
I'm David Greenwood.

1627
01:31:42.012 --> 01:31:43.213
Today. we're keeping a very
close eye

1628
01:31:43.247 --> 01:31:46.816
on what could only be described
as the most important trial

1629
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:49.086
in the history of Newark.

1630
01:31:49.119 --> 01:31:50.620
District attorney Anthony Jacobs

1631
01:31:50.653 --> 01:31:52.222
and defense attorney Michelle
Nichols

1632
01:31:52.254 --> 01:31:53.856
are about to begin their closing
remarks

1633
01:31:53.890 --> 01:31:54.958
in the trial of Bernard James.

1634
01:31:54.990 --> 01:31:57.793
This is all happening today
and I can tell you guys

1635
01:31:57.827 --> 01:32:00.297
from personal experience
that at most trials.

1636
01:32:00.329 --> 01:32:03.566
it all hinges on these closing
arguments by the attorneys.

1637
01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.869
However. the defense attorney
appears to be playing

1638
01:32:05.901 --> 01:32:08.171
by the New Jersey Nets rule.

1639
01:32:08.204 --> 01:32:10.440
as in they've already lost the
game

1640
01:32:10.472 --> 01:32:12.408
but they're still on the court.

1641
01:32:12.441 --> 01:32:14.610
Stay with us as we follow
this developing story

1642
01:32:14.644 --> 01:32:16.646
as it all unfolds.

1643
01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:39.436
All rise for the
honorable Judge Whitaker.

1644
01:32:57.587 --> 01:32:59.489
You may be seated.

1645
01:32:59.521 --> 01:33:00.457
Bring in the jury.

1646
01:33:18.975 --> 01:33:19.910
Are you prepared to proceed

1647
01:33:19.943 --> 01:33:22.244
with your closing statements.
counselors?

1648
01:33:22.278 --> 01:33:23.446
Yes. your honor. I am.

1649
01:33:33.823 --> 01:33:36.793
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury. you have just sat

1650
01:33:36.825 --> 01:33:39.261
through three weeks of the
biggest

1651
01:33:39.294 --> 01:33:41.832
and baddest gangster movie ever
performed.

1652
01:33:42.665 --> 01:33:46.302
It was better than the
Godfather. better than Casino.

1653
01:33:46.336 --> 01:33:50.973
It reminded me of Scarface
and just as fictitious.

1654
01:33:51.007 --> 01:33:55.845
It was written. directed and
produced by your very own

1655
01:33:55.878 --> 01:33:58.315
district attorney Anthony
Jacobs.

1656
01:33:59.281 --> 01:34:00.751
He deserves an Oscar.

1657
01:34:04.787 --> 01:34:09.258
But this isn't Hollywood.
ladies and gentlemen.

1658
01:34:09.292 --> 01:34:11.561
There's a man's life at stake.

1659
01:34:11.593 --> 01:34:14.263
And in these past few
weeks. not a single fact

1660
01:34:14.297 --> 01:34:18.267
has been presented by
Attorney Jacobs. not one.

1661
01:34:18.301 --> 01:34:20.971
He has merely presented
circumstantial evidence

1662
01:34:21.003 --> 01:34:24.341
held together by the
weak glue of assumption.

1663
01:34:24.373 --> 01:34:28.278
Assumption of crooked cops.
gangsters turned ministers.

1664
01:34:28.311 --> 01:34:31.815
five and dime hustlers and
not one law abiding citizen

1665
01:34:31.847 --> 01:34:34.350
in the bunch. not one.

1666
01:34:35.118 --> 01:34:38.754
He brings waywardness and the
faith of truth and glorifies

1667
01:34:38.788 --> 01:34:42.792
every word that comes out of
his mouth as to lure you away

1668
01:34:42.824 --> 01:34:45.962
from what's real. what's true.

1669
01:34:46.896 --> 01:34:48.964
And the witnesses he produced
certainly

1670
01:34:48.998 --> 01:34:51.702
aren't credible enough
to hang a man's life on.

1671
01:34:52.834 --> 01:34:53.802
The district attorney

1672
01:34:53.836 --> 01:34:58.275
has not proven Mr. James
committed any crimes.

1673
01:34:58.307 --> 01:34:59.908
What crimes did he commit?

1674
01:34:59.941 --> 01:35:01.910
I still don't know.

1675
01:35:01.944 --> 01:35:04.446
And it's supposed to be up
to you to find out based

1676
01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.450
on the evidence supplied by the
state?

1677
01:35:08.818 --> 01:35:10.520
I don't think so.

1678
01:35:10.552 --> 01:35:12.622
I don't think the jury
should confuse itself

1679
01:35:12.654 --> 01:35:15.624
with the manuscripts
attorney Jacobs presented

1680
01:35:15.658 --> 01:35:17.794
with the real facts of this
case.

1681
01:35:19.028 --> 01:35:21.463
If you do that. then you will
only see

1682
01:35:21.497 --> 01:35:24.501
that Mr. James is
innocent of these crimes.

1683
01:35:28.471 --> 01:35:29.339
Thank you.

1684
01:35:33.476 --> 01:35:35.779
Ladies and gentlemen. I
wanna thank you for your time

1685
01:35:35.811 --> 01:35:39.548
and your patience throughout
these past few weeks.

1686
01:35:39.582 --> 01:35:42.552
As I said in the beginning. I
mean. we could be doing a lot

1687
01:35:42.584 --> 01:35:45.388
of other things but it was our
duty

1688
01:35:46.455 --> 01:35:48.958
to ourselves and to each other.

1689
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:50.760
These past few weeks. we've been
submerged

1690
01:35:50.793 --> 01:35:53.630
in the murky waters of
Bernard James' life.

1691
01:35:53.663 --> 01:35:57.434
his disregard for life. law
and order and the property

1692
01:35:57.467 --> 01:36:00.737
of others from his youth.
stealing cars to the present.

1693
01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:04.107
His existence has been
filled with bloodshed.

1694
01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:08.645
murder. innocent victims
and shattered lives.

1695
01:36:08.677 --> 01:36:11.914
Now. we must do for Simone
Greenwood. her mother and father

1696
01:36:11.948 --> 01:36:14.551
what they are not here to do
today.

1697
01:36:14.583 --> 01:36:17.586
And Detective O'Neal
from the 27th Precinct.

1698
01:36:17.619 --> 01:36:19.789
the survivors and their
families.

1699
01:36:20.789 --> 01:36:23.392
Your duty is to them now.

1700
01:36:24.961 --> 01:36:28.731
Your duty is to honor each and
every life

1701
01:36:28.765 --> 01:36:32.569
that Bernard James has
taken because if you don't.

1702
01:36:34.704 --> 01:36:37.541
the lives that he takes in the
future

1703
01:36:38.574 --> 01:36:40.911
will be blood on your hands.

1704
01:36:42.578 --> 01:36:45.615
Let's hope and pray that
the next victim isn't you

1705
01:36:45.647 --> 01:36:50.619
or you. your brother. your
sister. your mom. your dad.

1706
01:36:50.653 --> 01:36:52.588
your husband. your wife

1707
01:36:54.489 --> 01:36:55.458
or your children.

1708
01:36:57.427 --> 01:36:59.763
If you we do not find justice

1709
01:36:59.796 --> 01:37:02.865
and find the defendant
Bernard James guilty today.

1710
01:37:04.199 --> 01:37:05.968
then each and every one of you

1711
01:37:07.003 --> 01:37:08.705
will leave this courtroom today

1712
01:37:08.738 --> 01:37:11.475
as guilty as this man right
here.

1713
01:37:24.654 --> 01:37:26.022
Thank you. Attorney Jacobs.

1714
01:40:06.649 --> 01:40:08.818
Michelle Nichols. I saw you on
TV.

1715
01:40:08.851 --> 01:40:09.919
You did an amazing job.

1716
01:40:09.952 --> 01:40:12.221
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1717
01:40:16.225 --> 01:40:17.694
Hey. check it out. king.

1718
01:40:17.726 --> 01:40:19.261
Ay. you work in that courthouse.
huh?

1719
01:40:19.294 --> 01:40:20.195
Yeah. bruh.

1720
01:40:20.230 --> 01:40:21.830
Yeah. I got an
opportunity of a lifetime.

1721
01:40:33.175 --> 01:40:37.212
You'll get the other
100 when the job's done.
