We had a handful of songs

<i>and a handful of scenes.</i>

352
00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:24.191

353
00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:26.443
LEA:<i> I did the first workshop</i>
<i>of</i> Spring Awakening

354
00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:28.404
<i>when I was 14 years old.</i>

355
00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:32.282
Even at 14. I was like.
"What is this?

356
00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:34.368
I have to do this."

357
00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:36.078
STEVEN:<i> For the years</i>
<i>we worked on it...</i>

358
00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:37.955
(CHUCKLES) ...we were
rejected everywhere.

359
00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:39.748
and everyone thought
we were out of our minds.

360
00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:42.084
We're sending a script
with this classical diction

361
00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.753
and German names
that no one could pronounce

362
00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.505
and a rock CD.

363
00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:48.674
MICHAEL:<i> And then</i>
<i>I invited Tom Hulce.</i>

364
00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:51.093
with whom
I was doing my first film.

365
00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:53.512
<i>to come and see a workshop.</i>

366
00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:56.598
As soon as he said 1890s
in Germany.

367
00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:59.435
and then the guitar plays
and the microphones come out.

368
00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:02.563
I thought. well.
that's a genius theatrical idea.

369
00:17:02.646 --> 00:17:03.564
I thought. "Oh. my God.

370
00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:05.649
this is kind of crazy
and amazing."

371
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.192
<i>And six months later.</i>

372
00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:09.236

<i>at Lincoln Center</i>

373

374
00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:15.409
This was it. We invited
every artistic director.

376

379
00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.294

a last-ditch effort

380
00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:29.131

409

410
00:19:12.734 --> 00:19:14.528
that there wasn't
a connection happening.

411
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:15.612
and we realized

412
00:19:15.696 --> 00:19:17.865
that nobody could find
who was singing

413
00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:20.033
because by the time
they found the person.

414
00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:21.743
<i>somebody else was singing.</i>

415
00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.203
There was not a laugh.

416
00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:25.581

what the hell was going on.

492
00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:31.076

<i>She was 14.</i>

494
00:23:33.328 --> 00:23:35.956
<i>She had three Broadway shows</i>
<i>to her credit.</i>

495
00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:37.374
She had this astonishing voice.

496
00:23:37.457 --> 00:23:40.127
and we fell instantly
in love with her.

497
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:44.589
<i>But it wasn't like a done deal.</i>
<i>So she worked her ass off.</i>

498
00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:47.342
I was so concerned
with doing good

499
00:23:47.425 --> 00:23:50.804

It's like all I wanted.

500

TOM:<i> Jonathan. he had been on</i>
<i>a tour of</i> The Sound of Music.

501
00:23:55.892 --> 00:24:00.730

JONATHAN:<i> I came into</i>

I was the last one on the list.

504
00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:11.158

she took off her shoes

505

JOHN:<i> I went and auditioned.</i>
<i>I was really nervous.</i>

508
00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:24.045
I didn't have
any formal vocal training.

509
00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:25.589
I got a final callback.

510
00:24:25.672 --> 00:24:28.049
and then I walked out
of my final callback

511
00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:31.052
because I had such
tremendous stage fright.

512
00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:33.221
<i>But I turned back around</i>
<i>and I went back up.</i>

513
00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:34.723

516
00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:41.479

517
00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:43.899

and the show at night.

MICHAEL:<i> These kids. they were</i>

519
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.738
Remi and Gerard were tutored

520
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:54.284

522
00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:58.205

523

Why. I'll tell you. Jonathan.
Rat tail comb.

1325
01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:28.614

to leave the show.
I did it for a year

1347

<i>or it was Jonathan Groff's idea.</i>

1352
01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:23.669
But what we're gonna do
is we're gonna sneak

1353
01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.339
into the theater
and have a sleepover.

1354
01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:31.052
I can't express to you
how illegal and unheard of

1355
01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:33.179
it is to sleep over
at a theater.

1356
01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.348
There was gonna be no light.
We brought candles.

1357
01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:38.059
we brought alcohol.
we brought food.

1362
01:05:45.983 --> 01:05:48.527
We all peed our pants.
We got so scared.

1363
01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.197
And then we heard
the front door just...

1364
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.659
and the power went...
(EXHALES) ...boom.

1365
