Hey. Rahayu.

4
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:09.000
Wake up. it's time for the dawn prayer.

5
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.166
Come on.

6
00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:24.250
-Rahayu. get out of here!
-Father!

7
00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:28.791
Rahayu! Leave her alone!
Don't touch my daughter!

8
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:33.208
Rahayu! Please don't hurt her!
Leave my daughter alone!

9
00:03:33.291 --> 00:03:36.375
Rahayu. run! Let her go! Let…

10
00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.333
Father!

17
00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:51.750
Let me help you.

18
00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:59.333
Excuse me.

19
00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.000
Coming through.

20
00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:08.416
Excuse me. Sorry.

21
00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:19.375
Do you want to buy some?

22
00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:23.750
Excuse me. This is for you. Ms. Endang.

23
00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:25.541
-Rahayu. bring it inside.
-Yes. ma'am.

24
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:28.250
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

25
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.791
Did you only order one bag?

26
00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:35.541
It should be two bags.

27
00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.625
-But there's only one.
-How many items are there in the bag?

28
00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:42.791
I counted ten.
Do you want me to bring them all?

29
00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:46.250
You can start putting the things
in boxes right now.

30
00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:49.708
so that Ms. Husni doesn't have to wait
and can pick them up easily tomorrow.

31
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:50.708
Alright.

32
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.791
One more thing.
please wrap the remaining stock.

33
00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:56.625
They were ordered for
Mr. Cholil's Quran school graduates.

34
00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:57.541
Okay. ma'am.

35
00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:01.833
Wow. you've got so many customers!

36
00:07:01.916 --> 00:07:04.041
Umrah plans for this year
seem promising for you.

37
00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:09.000
How long will you be away?

38
00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:12.875
I'm not sure. It might take a week or so.

39
00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:19.416
Alright. I'll leave now.

40
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.750
Take good care of this shop. Okay?

41
00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:25.458
Just ignore her.

42
00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:27.916
Thank you.

43
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.375
-Take care. ma'am.
-Okay.

44
00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:31.333
I see you have a complete package.

45
00:07:31.416 --> 00:07:33.916
a dedicated shopkeeper
and a lucky charm to boost your sales.

46
00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:39.583
Excuse me. Another one for Ms. Endang.

47
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.208
It's okay. I got this.
Where do you want it? Over there?

48
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:45.666
I got this.

49
00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:57.333
Thanks. uh…

50
00:07:57.416 --> 00:08:00.083
It's Ratman. Suratman.

51
00:08:05.708 --> 00:08:07.708
-I'm Rahayu.
-Okay. you're Rahayu.

52
00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:12.583
Be cautious.
She may not be as good as you think.

53
00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:14.625
You may get charmed.

54
00:08:15.291 --> 00:08:16.666
I think I already did.

55
00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.583
Excuse me.

56
00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:28.208
You little wench.

Ride a rickshaw?

59
00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:46.250
Please take a look.

60
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.083
How much is this?

61
00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:50.416
This one costs 5 000 rupiahs.

62
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.791
Ayu said she wanted to work
and help me out here.

63
00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:19.916
Things would be better
if you stayed at my place.

64
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.625
She would have better education.

65
00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:27.916
She could even go to college.

66
00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:39.625
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

67
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.875
Look. I've brought you
this month's harvest.

68
00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:54.666
And here's some money for you.

69
00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:00.708
Thank you.

70
00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:11.250
Aji. I brought you a toy.

71
00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:17.208
Do you like it?

72
00:10:18.416 --> 00:10:21.666
You shouldn't buy toys
for your little brother too often.

73
00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.625
It may spoil him.

74
00:10:26.583 --> 00:10:28.375
Teach him how to take care of himself.

75
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.000
Aji. shall we go upstairs? Let's go.

76
00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:39.208
Let's go upstairs.

77
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:42.250
You'd better return to Wonosalam.

78
00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:47.625
Your father was the only brother I had.

79
00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:52.041
He used to trust me to look after you.

80
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.708
So you are my responsibility as well.

81
00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:01.666
We'll be alright here.

82
00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:03.750
Ayu loves to be here.

83
00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:10.833
You're the one
who should make the decision.

84
00:11:10.916 --> 00:11:12.958
Don't leave everything to your kids.

85
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.250
They're the only ones I have.

86
00:11:19.541 --> 00:11:21.708
Even though Rahayu
is not my biological daughter…

87
00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:25.166
I love her as much as if she were.

88
00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:28.208
Look…

89
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:35.333
before he died. your late husband
told me to sell this place.

90
00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:39.875
You do know
about your husband's past. right?

91
00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:44.333
Things went south after he died.

92
00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:48.666
People here
have become increasingly judgmental.

93
00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:54.416
Be careful. Can you even see with that on?

94
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.166
Watch yourself. okay? It's already late.

95
00:13:00.458 --> 00:13:03.208
Aji. it's already late.

96
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.625
Go to bed. okay?

97
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.000
Mr. Sarwo?

98
00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:17.166
Excuse me.

99
00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:23.500
Mr. Sarwo?

100
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Hello?

101
00:15:24.583 --> 00:15:26.000
What are you doing here?

102
00:15:36.458 --> 00:15:40.791
Uh. your late father gave me that cane…

103
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.875
for me to guard it.

104
00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:47.583
It's a sacred cane.

105
00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:54.666
If you don't be careful with it…

106
00:15:55.916 --> 00:16:00.041
you might end up like your mother.

107
00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:10.416
I've brought you some bananas from my mom.

108
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:13.375
Thank you.

109
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:15.541
You're welcome. sir.

110
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.541
Rahayu.

111
00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:38.375
I heard that Sentot is still determined
to sell this shophouse.

112
00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:41.833
I understand your feelings.

113
00:16:43.083 --> 00:16:47.000
That's why you don't like
your step-grandfather.

114
00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:54.375
You see. some people can look holy.

115
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.500
But you'll never know
what's really going on inside.

116
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.083
If this shophouse sells…

117
00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:06.958
you can go back
to the house you grew up in.

118
00:17:09.666 --> 00:17:13.083
which your father has
donated as a prayer room.

119
00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:21.166
It's just behind the market.

120
00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:44.791
AL-MAKMUM PRAYER ROOM

121
00:17:44.875 --> 00:17:46.125
Do you still remember?

122
00:28:43.041 --> 00:28:43.875
Rahayu!

123
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Rahayu!

124
00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:09.166
AL-MAKMUM PRAYER ROOM

125
00:29:15.166 --> 00:29:16.666
Check this out!

126
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.583
Ours are cheaper!

127
00:29:20.833 --> 00:29:23.541
Ma'am. here's your delivery.

128
00:29:23.625 --> 00:29:25.291
You can choose many different colors.

129
00:29:25.375 --> 00:29:27.958
-We have the one that is pink and red.
-Thank you. but no.

130
00:29:28.041 --> 00:29:29.333
We also have the green one.

131
00:29:29.416 --> 00:29:32.458
You can see inside. miss.
We have a lot to choose from.

132
00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:35.958
Please come and take a look.
Here's the latest model.

133
00:29:39.291 --> 00:29:40.791
You. the daughter of a shaman!

134
00:29:41.458 --> 00:29:42.666
I know you're using a charm.

135
00:29:45.833 --> 00:29:47.250
I apologize for the inconvenience.

136
00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:49.458
Your charm won't work out here.

137
00:29:50.791 --> 00:29:54.541
I know your father was a great shaman.
but last time I checked. he was dead!

138
00:29:55.791 --> 00:29:58.416
What. are you going to charm me now?

139
00:29:59.958 --> 00:30:01.166
Say something!

140
00:30:01.958 --> 00:30:05.000
Shame on you. witch.

141
00:30:05.083 --> 00:30:06.583
You. the daughter of a darn shaman!

142
00:30:16.291 --> 00:30:18.333
Let me go. you witch!

143
00:30:19.208 --> 00:30:20.041
Ayu!

144
00:30:21.916 --> 00:30:23.500
Let me go!

145
00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:27.541
Ayu!

146
00:30:41.083 --> 00:30:44.000
-Oh my god.
-Ayu? Come to your senses.

147
00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:46.208
-Please give her this water.
-Thank you.

148
00:30:47.208 --> 00:30:49.625
Ayu. try to drink this. Come on.

149
00:30:49.708 --> 00:30:50.625
Are you alright?

150
00:30:51.333 --> 00:30:52.791
-Try to drink.
-Come on. Ayu.

151
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:57.666
She was possessed.

152
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.125
Possessed?

153
00:30:59.791 --> 00:31:02.791
It happened to my nephew too yesterday.

154
00:31:02.875 --> 00:31:04.208
He was from that prayer room.

155
00:31:05.208 --> 00:31:06.375
That prayer room?

156
00:31:08.125 --> 00:31:10.541
Were you going to that prayer room?

157
00:31:12.583 --> 00:31:15.625
The spirits who served his father
still live there!

158
00:31:17.416 --> 00:31:19.583
-You're Semedi's daughter. aren't you?
-Shush. shush!

159
00:31:20.416 --> 00:31:23.333
Everyone. please calm down. okay?

160
00:31:23.416 --> 00:31:25.041
Calm down.

161
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.458
Rahayu.

162
00:31:30.583 --> 00:31:32.458
Were you really disturbed
in that prayer room?

163
00:31:37.458 --> 00:31:38.458
Ayu!

164
00:31:42.416 --> 00:31:44.416
Everyone. leave now.

165
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.041
Return to your place.

166
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:56.291
Ayu.

167
00:32:02.541 --> 00:32:03.708
I heard…

168
00:32:05.125 --> 00:32:06.416
that today. at the market. you…

169
00:32:11.791 --> 00:32:12.833
Ayu.

170
00:32:24.125 --> 00:32:25.750
Were you praying in that prayer room?

171
00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:36.500
Were you disturbed by the…

172
00:32:36.583 --> 00:32:37.625
No.

173
00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:40.416
Nobody disturbed me.

174
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:49.083
Whenever you feel their presence…

175
00:32:51.041 --> 00:32:54.916
recite  Taawuz
and spit three times to your left.

176
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.291
Then. hopefully.
they will leave you alone.

177
00:33:05.791 --> 00:33:07.166
-Ayu.
-I know!

178
00:33:39.375 --> 00:33:42.333
MUSHOLA AL MAKMUM

179
00:34:24.708 --> 00:34:27.583
May Allah protect me
from the cursed devils.

180
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.583
Rahayu. throw that away!

181
00:37:50.416 --> 00:37:51.916
Calm down.

182
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.083
Sentot. please help me!

183
00:37:54.375 --> 00:37:55.875
Rahayu. Please. wake up!

184
00:37:57.958 --> 00:37:59.666
Rahayu. please wake up!

185
00:38:00.916 --> 00:38:04.458
If you can cure her.
then you can also afflict her.

186
00:38:04.541 --> 00:38:10.875
This kid has a potential that comes out
when you use your power in a certain way.

187
00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:16.041
-She's still too young.
-Wake up.

188
00:38:16.125 --> 00:38:18.416
We don't know what she's capable of doing.

189
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.833
I don't want Rahayu
to be near those spirits!

190
00:38:23.666 --> 00:38:25.041
We have to stop it…

191
00:38:25.833 --> 00:38:27.333
before it's too late.

192
00:38:27.416 --> 00:38:29.916
But you have to clean yourself up.

193
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:32.583
What do you mean?

194
00:38:32.666 --> 00:38:34.625
You must stop living this way.

195
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.583
You've been possessed by a spirit.

196
00:38:39.625 --> 00:38:41.041
A jinn!

197
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.083
Now you see the consequences.

198
00:38:49.041 --> 00:38:51.250
Please cure Ayu. Save her.

199
00:38:51.833 --> 00:38:55.000
Then I will do anything you want.

200
00:39:00.291 --> 00:39:01.500
Get me some water.

201
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:07.833
You've caused trouble in the neighborhood.

202
00:40:07.916 --> 00:40:11.333
What did my daughter do
that made your daughter try to kill her?

203
00:40:11.416 --> 00:40:12.791
Tell me!

204
00:40:13.375 --> 00:40:14.916
She's not an ordinary woman.

205
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.583
People in this neighborhood told me
that your daughter is haunted. Right?

206
00:40:19.666 --> 00:40:22.166
-Yes. she is!
-Yeah!

207
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:25.666
I know that your late husband
was a shaman.

208
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:28.125
He acted as if he were a holy man

209
00:40:28.208 --> 00:40:30.041
by donating a prayer room.

210
00:40:30.125 --> 00:40:33.416
But it turned out
that he did that with black magic.

211
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.000
What do you want now?
Do you want to murder my daughter?

212
00:40:37.083 --> 00:40:39.916
You want to cast a spell on my daughter?

213
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.250
-Please calm down.
-There she is!

214
00:40:43.333 --> 00:40:44.958
The daughter of that shaman!

215
00:40:46.666 --> 00:40:48.875
At first. we were glad that you left.

216
00:40:48.958 --> 00:40:51.666
But now that you're back.
you're bringing bad luck with you!

217
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.583
What do you want? Tell me!

218
00:40:53.666 --> 00:40:55.416
Calm down!

219
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.166
Everyone. please calm down.

220
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.958
I saw what happened.

221
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:02.375
Even if she was possessed.
it wasn't her fault.

222
00:41:02.458 --> 00:41:05.666
Hey. punk.
Don't act like you know everything.

223
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.791
You're still new here.

224
00:41:07.875 --> 00:41:10.000
You have no idea
what kind of person her father was.

225
00:41:10.666 --> 00:41:12.583
Rahayu. don't say anything…

226
00:41:12.666 --> 00:41:13.750
I do apologize.

227
00:41:16.333 --> 00:41:19.500
I had no intention to hurt anyone…

228
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:21.500
including Riri.

229
00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:24.833
Let's just go home. Mom.
I have a bad feeling about this.

230
00:41:24.916 --> 00:41:27.875
-Come on.
-Do you accept my apology?

231
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.875
Come on. Mom. I'm fine. really.

232
00:41:37.875 --> 00:41:39.791
You devil's child!

233
00:41:40.458 --> 00:41:42.208
You better watch yourself here.

234
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:44.166
Because we already know

235
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:47.833
that your father was beheaded
because he was a sorcerer!

236
00:41:47.916 --> 00:41:49.875
-Enough!
-Sorcerer!

237
00:41:49.958 --> 00:41:51.291
-You understand?
-That's enough.

238
00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:52.375
Understand. huh?

239
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:56.166
I'm so sorry. everyone.

240
00:42:11.291 --> 00:42:12.416
That's enough. Ayu.

241
00:42:13.166 --> 00:42:14.791
No more trouble. okay?

242
00:42:18.375 --> 00:42:19.208
Ayu…

243
00:42:31.708 --> 00:42:35.375
Why did those people get mad at Mom?

244
00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:40.500
They didn't get mad at Mom.

245
00:42:42.166 --> 00:42:43.500
She's alright.

246
00:42:44.083 --> 00:42:45.500
Now. it's time to sleep.

247
00:43:23.166 --> 00:43:25.750
Why did you have to
cause such a commotion?

248
00:43:28.125 --> 00:43:30.750
You were the one who asked to live here.

249
00:43:32.291 --> 00:43:34.791
If this keeps up. then we…

250
00:43:34.875 --> 00:43:37.041
I was born and raised here.

251
00:43:39.375 --> 00:43:41.625
This is all that my father left behind.

252
00:43:41.708 --> 00:43:44.416
Then please do me a favor.

253
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.041
Act normally.

254
00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:49.666
Stop creating any more trouble.

255
00:43:52.208 --> 00:43:54.958
I've done everything you wanted.

256
00:43:56.625 --> 00:43:57.791
So please…

257
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.875
do this family a favor.

258
00:44:00.958 --> 00:44:02.375
so we can live…

259
00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:04.625
peacefully.

260
00:44:10.375 --> 00:44:13.083
Sentot has told us…

261
00:44:14.041 --> 00:44:15.875
-that…
-we can move in with him.

262
00:44:21.541 --> 00:44:24.208
So that he can take over
my father's money.

263
00:44:25.208 --> 00:44:26.500
What did you say?

264
00:44:28.583 --> 00:44:30.333
Sentot has been manipulating you.

265
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:36.041
He married off my father to you
after my mother died.

266
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.041
My real mother.

267
00:44:41.875 --> 00:44:43.458
And now my father's no longer here.

268
00:44:44.416 --> 00:44:48.625
So it's easier for him now
to take over father's wealth.

269
00:45:06.458 --> 00:45:08.708
Praise be to Allah.

270
00:45:14.291 --> 00:45:15.416
Ayu?

271
00:45:18.416 --> 00:45:21.083
Don't worry. There's nothing here.

272
00:45:25.583 --> 00:45:27.083
Do you want me to stay?

273
00:45:28.541 --> 00:45:31.083
No. I'm good. You can go.

274
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:34.916
Okay.

275
00:47:49.416 --> 00:47:50.333
Ayu?

276
00:47:51.291 --> 00:47:53.000
Did they show up again?

277
00:47:53.083 --> 00:47:54.375
"They"?

278
00:47:55.916 --> 00:47:56.958
Who are "they"?

279
00:47:59.541 --> 00:48:01.875
You recklessly summoned them.

280
00:48:03.083 --> 00:48:06.166
You can't stop them now that they're here.

281
00:48:07.958 --> 00:48:10.041
I was the one who summoned them?

282
00:48:12.458 --> 00:48:13.500
Yes.

283
00:48:18.625 --> 00:48:20.000
You were praying…

284
00:48:21.458 --> 00:48:22.791
and you were disturbed.

285
00:48:23.958 --> 00:48:25.833
I did recite  Taawuz.
because I was told to.

286
00:48:25.916 --> 00:48:27.666
And spit three times to the left?

287
00:48:29.166 --> 00:48:33.083
Then what will you say if it turns out
that you really did call them?

288
00:48:37.708 --> 00:48:39.291
Who do you mean by "they"?

289
00:48:40.333 --> 00:48:42.291
Your childhood friends.

290
00:48:46.541 --> 00:48:47.750
What do you mean?

291
00:48:49.125 --> 00:48:53.500
That house. the prayer room. this town.

292
00:48:53.583 --> 00:48:56.666
those places made you
the way you are today.

293
00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.625
Your father was a good person.

294
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:02.625
and so are you.

295
00:49:06.375 --> 00:49:11.875
Sentot. your stepmother.
your father's tragic demise.

296
00:49:11.958 --> 00:49:13.375
and you returning to this town…

297
00:49:14.375 --> 00:49:20.458
It has compelled you
to confront your own truth.

298
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:25.916
Ayu. you're not an ordinary person.

299
00:49:26.916 --> 00:49:31.125
That's why Sentot and your father
performed exorcism on you.

300
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:33.708
But it wasn't finished yet.

301
00:49:34.458 --> 00:49:39.166
You saw for yourself
that you could summon them…

302
00:49:40.041 --> 00:49:41.625
even when you didn't know it.

303
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.041
They were waiting for you.

304
00:49:44.916 --> 00:49:49.083
They were the ones
who went to the prayer room to see you.

305
00:51:01.375 --> 00:51:03.875
Just 5 000 rupiahs for two bags.
I can wrap them up for you.

306
00:51:03.958 --> 00:51:05.041
The red ones. right?

307
00:51:05.125 --> 00:51:06.833
-Forget about it.
-Why?

308
00:51:06.916 --> 00:51:10.333
I gave you the cheapest price.
These flowers are fresh.

309
00:51:10.416 --> 00:51:12.500
-May I help you. miss?
-How much are these?

310
00:51:12.583 --> 00:51:15.500
-It's 5 000 rupiahs for two bags.
-Alright. I'll get two of them.

311
00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:20.125
-I'll add the fresh ones for you.
-Thanks.

312
00:51:22.166 --> 00:51:23.375
Here you go.

313
00:51:24.625 --> 00:51:26.250
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

314
00:51:30.916 --> 00:51:34.625
Like daughter. like mother.

315
00:51:34.708 --> 00:51:36.416
You both sure are using a charm.

316
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.166
You don't care about us here at all.

317
00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:43.208
You might as well just take all the money
from the buyers in this market!

318
00:51:45.333 --> 00:51:47.750
Take them. all you want!
That makes you happy. right?

319
00:51:48.458 --> 00:51:50.541
You and your daughter really are amazing.

320
00:51:51.375 --> 00:51:53.458
What? Why don't you say something?

321
00:51:54.291 --> 00:51:56.416
Don't act like you're so holy.

322
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.583
You and your evil family!
I'm sick of you all!

323
00:52:16.916 --> 00:52:18.458
My leg!

324
00:52:19.333 --> 00:52:20.625
My leg hurts!

325
00:52:20.708 --> 00:52:22.000
-My leg!
-Mother!

326
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:30.208
Riri! Help. my legs! It hurts!

327
00:52:31.416 --> 00:52:32.958
Please. help!

328
00:52:37.791 --> 00:52:40.125
-Oh my God!
-Mother!

329
00:52:41.041 --> 00:52:42.583
Goodness gracious!

330
00:52:54.375 --> 00:52:55.791
Let me help you.

331
00:52:58.416 --> 00:52:59.708
Watch your step.

332
00:53:10.333 --> 00:53:13.416
-Nuning. show yourself!
-Show yourself!

333
00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:17.500
-Nuning. show yourself!
-Get out!

334
00:53:20.291 --> 00:53:21.958
-Come out here!
-Show yourself!

335
00:53:22.041 --> 00:53:23.791
-Sir…
-You sorcerer!

336
00:53:23.875 --> 00:53:27.083
-Calm down. What's going on here?
-Mind your own business!

337
00:53:28.333 --> 00:53:30.583
Nuning! Come out. you sorcerer!

338
00:53:32.916 --> 00:53:35.208
-Nuning! Come and show yourself!
-Come out here!

339
00:53:38.208 --> 00:53:40.375
Don't you dare to run!

340
00:53:41.333 --> 00:53:44.291
Ayu. No.

341
00:53:44.375 --> 00:53:47.166
Don't open the door.

342
00:53:49.583 --> 00:53:51.041
-Nuning!
-Hey. Nuning!

343
00:53:51.125 --> 00:53:53.500
Stop it! What's going on here?

344
00:53:54.625 --> 00:53:58.791
A lot of people have been hurt
since that woman came here.

345
00:53:58.875 --> 00:54:00.333
That's true.

346
00:54:00.416 --> 00:54:01.583
So?

347
00:54:01.666 --> 00:54:03.583
Don't act like you have no idea.

348
00:54:03.666 --> 00:54:06.166
It was Semedi's wife
who had been putting a spell on them.

349
00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:08.208
I have to go out there.

350
00:54:08.291 --> 00:54:10.375
-No. don't!
-No. Ayu.

351
00:54:10.458 --> 00:54:11.916
Don't go!

352
00:54:13.125 --> 00:54:15.208
Watch your tongue!

353
00:54:15.291 --> 00:54:17.625
Last time.
Rahayu strangled Minah's daughter.

354
00:54:18.708 --> 00:54:19.916
Help!

355
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.916
And now Minah is being harmed.

356
00:54:22.625 --> 00:54:24.291
How is Minah being harmed?

357
00:54:24.375 --> 00:54:28.375
Her legs are festering
due to the spell cast by Semedi's wife.

358
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.875
My leg!

359
00:54:30.958 --> 00:54:31.958
Oh my god!

360
00:54:32.041 --> 00:54:34.083
-It's true!
-Yeah!

361
00:54:34.166 --> 00:54:36.541
Don't you dare mention the dead!

362
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:40.708
His wife and daughter
came here to make a living.

363
00:54:40.791 --> 00:54:42.291
You shouldn't bother them!

364
00:54:43.041 --> 00:54:44.875
Don't act like you're all perfect.

365
00:54:44.958 --> 00:54:49.375
I'm well aware that some of you
have evil spirits working for you.

366
00:54:55.833 --> 00:54:57.750
If something bad happens…

367
00:54:58.333 --> 00:55:02.458
you will be the one to blame.

368
00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:05.958
Fine. Alright.

369
00:55:06.041 --> 00:55:07.625
Now leave!

370
00:55:08.958 --> 00:55:11.125
Stop harassing a widow and her kids.

371
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:47.583
Mother?

372
00:57:02.833 --> 00:57:07.875
Mother!

373
00:57:29.291 --> 00:57:30.208
Calm down.

374
00:57:30.875 --> 00:57:33.625
You're fortunate
that I managed to calm them down.

375
00:57:34.291 --> 00:57:37.875
If it hadn't been for me.
your family would've been in grave danger.

376
00:57:37.958 --> 00:57:40.083
My husband wasn't a sorcerer.

377
00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:41.958
He helped other people in his own way.

378
00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:44.333
"Helped other people"?
Stop blabbering nonsense.

379
00:57:44.416 --> 00:57:46.166
Ms. Minah died in a tragic way.

380
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:48.208
Her legs were rotting overnight.

381
00:57:49.583 --> 00:57:51.583
Is that what "helping other people"
means to you?

382
00:57:52.291 --> 00:57:54.416
Even if it were true
that Semedi was a sorcerer.

383
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:55.708
he has already passed away.

384
00:57:57.541 --> 00:58:02.000
And there's no way Nuning and Rahayu
could cause any harm to Riri and Minah.

385
00:58:03.416 --> 00:58:05.750
We might have let you defend them before.

386
00:58:05.833 --> 00:58:10.833
but now you can see
that the people want justice.

387
00:58:10.916 --> 00:58:12.583
-Yes. we do!
-Right!

388
00:58:12.666 --> 00:58:13.833
What are you going to do?

389
00:58:13.916 --> 00:58:17.458
You're going to behead them too. huh?

390
00:58:17.541 --> 00:58:20.708
First. they need to acknowledge
their wrongdoing.

391
00:58:20.791 --> 00:58:24.791
And then we can determine
an appropriate punishment for them.

392
00:58:24.875 --> 00:58:28.083
No. We won't admit to things we didn't do.

393
00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:30.791
Why do you keep bothering our family?

394
00:58:31.583 --> 00:58:32.791
Leave my property.

395
00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:39.000
I said leave!

396
00:58:39.083 --> 00:58:40.375
-Hey. hey.
-Go away!

397
00:58:40.458 --> 00:58:42.833
-Calm down. Ayu.
-Ayu!

398
00:58:42.916 --> 00:58:44.750
See? Daughter of a witch.

399
00:58:44.833 --> 00:58:48.000
You can't make someone say
they did something they didn't do.

400
00:58:49.375 --> 00:58:53.291
And you can't tell the police

401
00:58:53.375 --> 00:58:55.750
because you don't have strong evidence.

402
00:58:55.833 --> 00:58:57.708
So what are you going to do now?

403
00:58:57.791 --> 00:59:00.375
What kind of answer can you give?
Please tell us.

404
00:59:00.458 --> 00:59:04.250
-Yeah. we need an answer.
-Tell me about it!

405
00:59:05.583 --> 00:59:10.083
God is the only one who knows
if you are using black magic or not.

406
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.625
You'll have to swear
and look God in the eye.

407
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.375
What do you mean?

408
00:59:21.041 --> 00:59:24.208
You're going to perform a Pocong Oath.

409
00:59:26.416 --> 00:59:27.333
I will do that.

410
00:59:28.333 --> 00:59:30.416
I'm going to show you that we're innocent.

411
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.333
-Ayu.
-No!

412
00:59:32.416 --> 00:59:34.875
She's not going to perform the oath…

413
00:59:35.875 --> 00:59:36.875
but her mother will.

414
00:59:39.416 --> 00:59:41.916
Minah died
because someone was using black magic.

415
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.500
Before she died.
she was arguing with this woman.

416
00:59:45.583 --> 00:59:50.708
So. if someone used black magic on her.
it must have been this woman.

417
00:59:50.791 --> 00:59:52.083
Yeah!

418
00:59:52.166 --> 00:59:57.083
And if she still won't say it.
let her die while she's taking her oath.

419
00:59:57.666 --> 00:59:59.916
I will take the oath instead of her.

420
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.541
So I can die and see my father again.

421
01:00:01.625 --> 01:00:03.958
Shut it. Ayu! Do not say a word!

422
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.958
Come here. baby.

423
01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.833
Don't do that.

424
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.833
There is no other way.

425
01:00:17.041 --> 01:00:22.625
If Nuning agrees to take the oath
and remains alive thereafter…

426
01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:25.958
I want all of you…

427
01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:29.958
to stop bothering them.

428
01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:31.333
Okay?

429
01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:35.458
This time. I agree with your idea.

430
01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:38.208
Let's go.

431
01:00:38.291 --> 01:00:39.291
Bye!

432
01:01:19.666 --> 01:01:24.208
These shophouses need to be cleansed.

433
01:01:24.291 --> 01:01:26.791
and Rahayu needs to be exorcised again.

434
01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:30.958
Are you saying
you'll be the one to perform the exorcism?

435
01:01:31.916 --> 01:01:35.041
Just like what you did to her
when she was young?

436
01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:40.916
Look. Sarwo. Back then.
Semedi was given this shophouse as a gift.

437
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
for curing a conglomerate from the effects
of witchcraft cast by their enemy.

438
01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:48.583
Unfortunately…

439
01:01:49.625 --> 01:01:53.750
Semedi used the help of spirits
to support the healing process.

440
01:01:56.041 --> 01:02:00.666
You should have been to blame

441
01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:05.166
because you were the one
who got him interested in the occult.

442
01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:10.500
Don't act so righteous in front of me

443
01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:13.333
as if you think
I'm going down the wrong path.

444
01:02:14.916 --> 01:02:20.125
I know that I don't pray
the same way you do.

445
01:02:20.958 --> 01:02:24.833
but I also have a God. just like you do.

446
01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:27.958
What we need now isn't a Pocong Oath.

447
01:02:28.041 --> 01:02:29.875
People need proof.

448
01:02:30.583 --> 01:02:32.708
and the Pocong Oath is the answer.

449
01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:39.000
You're just making things worse.

450
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:43.791
Maybe you are the real reason
Rahayu is having so much trouble.

451
01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:50.125
And now you're taking over
her father's wealth.

452
01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:51.041
Sarwo!

453
01:02:53.083 --> 01:02:54.666
He left it with me.

454
01:02:55.583 --> 01:02:56.916
and I didn't rob him.

455
01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:00.333
Rahayu never believed you.

456
01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:06.750
And is your reason for doing the exorcism
as good as you say it is?

457
01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:17.875
MOSQUE OF JETIS

458
01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:04.083
Ayu. where are you going?

459
01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:35.291
AL-MAKMUM PRAYER ROOM

460
01:05:09.208 --> 01:05:11.125
Repeat after me.

461
01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:18.875
I swear…

462
01:05:21.333 --> 01:05:24.583
-I swear…
-I did not perform any witchcraft…

463
01:05:24.666 --> 01:05:26.916
I did not perform any witchcraft…

464
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.333
Against  Minah Tarjo.

465
01:05:30.416 --> 01:05:32.833
Against  Minah Tarjo.

466
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.375
If I did…

467
01:05:39.166 --> 01:05:40.958
If I did…

468
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.333
Then I am ready to die instantly
as of this moment.

469
01:05:48.875 --> 01:05:53.666
Then I am ready to die instantly
as of this moment.

470
01:06:47.208 --> 01:06:48.333
Semedi?

471
01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:55.875
Ayu!

472
01:07:58.291 --> 01:07:59.500
Ayu!

473
01:08:21.625 --> 01:08:23.000
Ayu!

474
01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:37.125
This woman has kept her promise.
just as you all wanted.

475
01:08:37.208 --> 01:08:39.208
So I'm asking everyone to leave…

476
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.666
because nobody will suffer tonight.

477
01:08:44.083 --> 01:08:45.500
Go home and be thankful…

478
01:08:46.541 --> 01:08:50.958
that all of you have been saved
from a needless sin.

479
01:08:51.041 --> 01:08:52.500
Leave. now!

480
01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:29.875
Why are you messing with your food?
Are you finished?

481
01:09:29.958 --> 01:09:30.958
Yeah.

482
01:09:58.833 --> 01:10:00.458
Oh. hi. Ayu.

483
01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:02.625
Make a bowl for me.

484
01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:05.875
I have to go.

485
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.333
-Here's the money.
-Oh. right.

486
01:10:08.416 --> 01:10:09.666
-Thanks.
-Ayu.

487
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.125
I heard that you're leaving.

488
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.041
Who told you that?

489
01:10:15.125 --> 01:10:17.083
Uh. people at the market told me.

490
01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:21.000
They said someone
is going to buy your shophouse very soon.

491
01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:24.958
That's just rumors.

492
01:10:29.083 --> 01:10:34.666
These shophouses were donated
to my late husband in 1992.

493
01:10:35.291 --> 01:10:37.000
What is the land area?

494
01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:43.375
It's approximately 500 square metre
for four shophouses.

495
01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:46.791
So it's 500 square metre.
We'll measure it again just to be sure.

496
01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:48.458
-Can you do that for me?
-Sure.

497
01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:49.458
Okay.

498
01:10:50.208 --> 01:10:52.875
Do you have all the necessary
and full paperwork for the land?

499
01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.791
Yes. of course.

500
01:10:55.875 --> 01:10:59.458
Okay. thank you for your time.
We'll see you soon.

501
01:10:59.541 --> 01:11:01.458
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

502
01:11:14.541 --> 01:11:16.666
You're home. already? At this hour?

503
01:11:18.833 --> 01:11:20.083
Do you want something to eat?

504
01:11:22.916 --> 01:11:25.041
Those people are Sentot's men.
aren't they?

505
01:11:31.208 --> 01:11:32.291
They are. aren't they?

506
01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:37.583
Look…

507
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:46.625
Your father did leave Sentot some lands
that he planned to sell.

508
01:11:47.541 --> 01:11:48.958
-And now…
-And now…

509
01:11:49.833 --> 01:11:51.500
he will take full control of everything.

510
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Ayu…

511
01:11:55.125 --> 01:11:57.458
please stop being biased.

512
01:11:57.541 --> 01:12:00.875
He helped your father find repentance.

513
01:12:00.958 --> 01:12:02.333
"Repentance"?

514
01:12:02.416 --> 01:12:03.750
So you now agree with him

515
01:12:04.541 --> 01:12:06.875
that my father was so bad
that he had to repent?

516
01:12:12.375 --> 01:12:17.166
Your father used to engage in connections
with black magic from another realm.

517
01:12:18.833 --> 01:12:21.250
I knew that even before we got married.

518
01:12:22.291 --> 01:12:23.291
And as it turned out.

519
01:12:24.375 --> 01:12:26.916
everything he did came with a price.

520
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.541
What do you mean?

521
01:12:28.625 --> 01:12:30.375
During the Pocong Oath ceremony yesterday.

522
01:12:31.166 --> 01:12:35.250
the evil spirits that granted him power.

523
01:12:35.333 --> 01:12:38.500
supernatural protection.
pesugihan. spells…

524
01:12:39.166 --> 01:12:40.875
They were all pursuing me.

525
01:12:42.916 --> 01:12:44.666
Then how are you still alive?

526
01:12:49.083 --> 01:12:50.500
I saw you there.

527
01:12:53.958 --> 01:12:56.125
You were among them.

528
01:12:57.125 --> 01:13:00.875
Ayu. we need to break away from them.

529
01:13:01.666 --> 01:13:05.250
Or else. the devils
who have us under their control will…

530
01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:08.125
Sentot's desire to take over
my father's money is the real devil.

531
01:13:14.208 --> 01:13:15.125
Ayu…

532
01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:21.541
Your uncle. who always tries to look holy.
is the real devil.

533
01:13:22.583 --> 01:13:24.958
He's trying
to take control of my father's wealth.

534
01:13:25.041 --> 01:13:27.208
That night.
he was the one who planned the murder.

535
01:13:28.541 --> 01:13:31.041
He was the one who murdered my father.

536
01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:35.375
On the day we were kicked out
from our home by the community…

537
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.916
there was one person among them
who had a wound on his face.

538
01:13:42.833 --> 01:13:45.333
I was the one who caused that wound.

539
01:13:45.416 --> 01:13:47.708
Those people were the ones
who killed my father.

540
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:52.625
And Sentot knew them.

541
01:13:53.708 --> 01:13:54.833
They were conspiring.

542
01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:58.958
All of that wealth belongs to my father.

543
01:13:59.541 --> 01:14:03.083
and he paid his dues…

544
01:14:03.166 --> 01:14:07.791
by having his head severed like an animal!

545
01:14:08.583 --> 01:14:12.833
So you should really stop believing
in how holy Sentot is

546
01:14:12.916 --> 01:14:14.750
because it's all fake.

547
01:14:15.416 --> 01:14:21.666
Or your fate will end up like…

548
01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:26.166
my real mother!

549
01:15:25.375 --> 01:15:26.416
Ms. Endang…

550
01:15:27.583 --> 01:15:28.791
I'm sorry that I…

551
01:15:30.041 --> 01:15:31.208
I overslept.

552
01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:42.458
-Ayu.
-Yes. ma'am?

553
01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:47.125
This is for you.

554
01:15:52.458 --> 01:15:53.750
What is this for?

555
01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:55.958
You don't need to come to work tomorrow.

556
01:16:02.416 --> 01:16:05.000
-What do you mean?
-You're fired.

557
01:16:07.333 --> 01:16:09.250
-I know I made a mistake. but…
-That's enough.

558
01:16:11.416 --> 01:16:12.416
Leave.

559
01:16:26.041 --> 01:16:26.958
Fine.

560
01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:54.125
Father…

561
01:18:13.625 --> 01:18:17.333
Shame on you. witch!
You. the daughter of a darn shaman!

562
01:18:17.416 --> 01:18:18.750
You devil's child!

563
01:18:18.833 --> 01:18:20.666
You better watch yourself here.

564
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:22.833
Because we already know

565
01:18:22.916 --> 01:18:27.333
that your father was beheaded
because he was a sorcerer!

566
01:18:27.416 --> 01:18:30.083
- You're fired.
- I know I made a mistake. but…

567
01:18:30.666 --> 01:18:31.833
Leave.

568
01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:35.833
Minah's legs were festering!

569
01:18:37.333 --> 01:18:39.750
We need to break away from them.

570
01:18:39.833 --> 01:18:43.041
Or else. the devils
who have us under their control will…

571
01:20:50.166 --> 01:20:51.916
Mother. I'm thirsty.

572
01:20:57.666 --> 01:20:58.833
Mother?

573
01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:13.125
Yes. son?

574
01:21:13.208 --> 01:21:14.875
I'm thirsty.

575
01:21:15.458 --> 01:21:17.291
Oh. right…

576
01:21:17.375 --> 01:21:18.541
I'll get you some water.

577
01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:22.500
Aji. watch out!

578
01:21:31.916 --> 01:21:32.750
Aji!

579
01:22:18.583 --> 01:22:19.500
Mother!

580
01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:22.333
Mother!

581
01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:27.291
Mother!

582
01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:28.541
What have you done?

583
01:22:38.625 --> 01:22:39.875
Stop it…

584
01:22:57.208 --> 01:22:58.125
Aji?

585
01:23:00.416 --> 01:23:01.416
Aji.

586
01:23:02.541 --> 01:23:03.500
Aji.

587
01:23:04.083 --> 01:23:05.125
Wake up. my son.

588
01:23:08.666 --> 01:23:09.958
Oh my god.

589
01:23:12.833 --> 01:23:14.833
Mom. it hurts!

590
01:23:16.166 --> 01:23:17.208
Aji…

591
01:23:22.375 --> 01:23:26.583
Aji! Oh my god…

592
01:23:26.666 --> 01:23:28.250
My son…

593
01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:36.250
Ayu…

594
01:23:37.083 --> 01:23:38.416
Ayu!

595
01:23:51.333 --> 01:23:55.208
Aji. please wake up.

596
01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:10.583
Semedi?

597
01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.291
Please forgive me.

598
01:24:16.291 --> 01:24:18.291
I deserve to die.

599
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:21.041
I deserve to die.

600
01:24:27.625 --> 01:24:28.791
Semedi…

601
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:30.500
Semedi…

602
01:24:30.583 --> 01:24:31.875
Mother…

603
01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.333
Please let me die.

604
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:10.916
Aji?

605
01:26:18.250 --> 01:26:19.541
Where are they?

606
01:26:28.333 --> 01:26:32.125
AL-JANNAH BOARDING SCHOOL

607
01:26:32.208 --> 01:26:35.500
You just relax. okay? You are safe here.

608
01:26:36.583 --> 01:26:39.125
Finally. you all managed to get me here.

609
01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:44.291
Are they going to do an exorcism on me
like they did back then?

610
01:26:45.666 --> 01:26:51.625
Sentot always saw your father
as if he were his own son.

611
01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:55.208
So he won't do you harm.

612
01:26:55.291 --> 01:26:57.666
He's been targeting my father's money
for quite some time.

613
01:27:01.833 --> 01:27:04.625
Sentot is a rich man.

614
01:27:06.916 --> 01:27:12.250
He's rich in both material possessions
and compassion.

615
01:27:13.625 --> 01:27:19.666
He built this boarding school
and other facilities for the people.

616
01:27:21.458 --> 01:27:26.375
Everyone can stay and study here for free.

617
01:27:29.041 --> 01:27:32.583
So he doesn't need your father's money.

618
01:27:38.833 --> 01:27:40.208
Right.

619
01:27:40.291 --> 01:27:41.708
just lie down and take it easy.

620
01:27:58.958 --> 01:27:59.791
My mother…

621
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:02.791
and Aji…

622
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:11.916
Are they no longer with us?

623
01:28:56.166 --> 01:28:59.375
You have to gain Rahayu's trust…

624
01:29:00.541 --> 01:29:03.375
to really save her. Sentot.

625
01:29:04.666 --> 01:29:09.875
I think she's somehow connected
to that prayer room…

626
01:29:09.958 --> 01:29:13.166
where her father used to do his practice.

627
01:29:15.125 --> 01:29:18.583
There's something there
that keeps drawing her back.

628
01:29:18.666 --> 01:29:20.750
and it's tied her to two different realms.

629
01:29:26.041 --> 01:29:30.375
AL-JANNAH BOARDING SCHOOL

630
01:29:45.583 --> 01:29:47.333
I seek forgiveness from God.

631
01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:58.541
Sentot.

632
01:30:00.416 --> 01:30:01.541
-Sentot.
-Mm?

633
01:30:04.166 --> 01:30:05.333
What's wrong?

634
01:30:10.625 --> 01:30:12.750
You must go to that prayer room.

635
01:30:14.791 --> 01:30:16.541
Once you get there…

636
01:30:16.625 --> 01:30:18.875
you need to find that snake cane.

637
01:30:34.333 --> 01:30:37.125
You didn't kill them.

638
01:30:37.208 --> 01:30:40.750
You're not a murderer. remember that.

639
01:30:40.833 --> 01:30:43.833
You have no idea what those snakes are.

640
01:30:44.625 --> 01:30:45.875
They were coming out of me.

641
01:30:46.458 --> 01:30:49.208
Those snakes do not belong in this world.

642
01:30:49.916 --> 01:30:52.125
It was beyond your control.

643
01:30:54.083 --> 01:30:57.041
Those spirits have been manipulating you.

644
01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:05.041
How do you know?

645
01:31:05.125 --> 01:31:07.333
You're not alone.

646
01:31:08.416 --> 01:31:12.291
I was just like you when I was younger.

647
01:31:13.458 --> 01:31:15.625
I was very sensitive…

648
01:31:17.208 --> 01:31:21.166
and I couldn't control my own power.

649
01:31:24.375 --> 01:31:26.125
It took a lot of victims…

650
01:31:27.375 --> 01:31:28.916
including my own family.

651
01:31:29.875 --> 01:31:33.791
Sentot helped me and guided me.

652
01:31:37.333 --> 01:31:41.000
These evil spirits
feed on grudges and remorse.

653
01:31:44.208 --> 01:31:48.125
And they're comfortable
to stay in your body.

654
01:31:54.041 --> 01:31:56.958
They must get out of your body.

655
01:31:58.750 --> 01:32:02.708
We need to completely cleanse them.

656
01:32:35.375 --> 01:32:38.041
It's unusual. No greetings?
That's unheard of.

657
01:32:39.291 --> 01:32:42.041
You don't deserve a greeting from me.

658
01:32:42.125 --> 01:32:43.041
you bastard.

659
01:32:51.208 --> 01:32:52.291
I found it.

660
01:32:53.250 --> 01:32:55.958
You scum! Give it back to me!
Give it back!

661
01:32:56.041 --> 01:33:01.375
Stay away from Rahayu. my child.
and all of my students.

662
01:33:35.833 --> 01:33:37.958
Rahayu. the daughter of Semedi…

663
01:33:40.333 --> 01:33:42.583
with the grace and power of Allah…

664
01:33:43.833 --> 01:33:46.625
you will undergo
a purification process to rid yourself

665
01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:48.750
of any evils that may reside within you.

666
01:33:48.833 --> 01:33:50.416
Are you willing to let it go?

667
01:34:20.083 --> 01:34:21.958
Rahayu. the daughter of Semedi…

668
01:34:23.291 --> 01:34:25.791
with the grace and power of Allah…

669
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:30.333
you will undergo a purification process
to rid yourself of any evil

670
01:34:30.416 --> 01:34:32.250
that may reside within you.

671
01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:33.750
Are you willing to let them go?

672
01:34:36.583 --> 01:34:37.708
I'm…

673
01:34:39.083 --> 01:34:41.500
not willing to let them go.

674
01:34:48.375 --> 01:34:49.375
You bastard!

675
01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:53.875
Die you! Die!

676
01:35:39.625 --> 01:35:41.250
Ayu!

677
01:35:42.541 --> 01:35:44.375
I am Sentot. your grandfather!

678
01:35:45.041 --> 01:35:50.000
I'm not here to harm you.
I want to save you.

679
01:35:50.083 --> 01:35:52.500
I know you murdered my father.

680
01:35:52.583 --> 01:35:55.875
No. it wasn't me. I swear!

681
01:35:55.958 --> 01:35:58.666
But you know who murdered him.

682
01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:02.833
He's taken away everything I had!

683
01:36:02.916 --> 01:36:04.791
Including all my patients.

684
01:36:04.875 --> 01:36:06.083
He's getting even richer!

685
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:09.583
You've taken away everything I had.

686
01:36:09.666 --> 01:36:13.291
Now. I will take
your daughter away from you.

687
01:36:15.125 --> 01:36:18.708
Do you know how powerful his daughter is?

688
01:36:18.791 --> 01:36:25.000
She will assist me
in attaining both glory and wealth!

689
01:36:25.083 --> 01:36:29.125
So you are the one
who've been targeting Rahayu's wealth?

690
01:36:29.875 --> 01:36:33.791
If you want to inherit all my abilities…

691
01:36:33.875 --> 01:36:39.875
you have to steal the snake cane
from my perverted student.

692
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.666
It was my son who did it. your uncle!

693
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:05.000
Uncle. my foot.

694
01:37:05.083 --> 01:37:07.541
He was used by Sarwo!

695
01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:11.583
Husni.

696
01:37:13.125 --> 01:37:14.458
Get rid of Semedi.

697
01:37:15.916 --> 01:37:17.666
Don't let Wahid know. okay?

698
01:37:18.541 --> 01:37:20.833
Rahayu! Let go of my daughter!

699
01:37:30.083 --> 01:37:32.000
I'm sorry. Father.

700
01:37:33.541 --> 01:37:36.291
I really didn't know

701
01:37:36.375 --> 01:37:40.666
that Sarwo asked Husni to kill Semedi.

702
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:43.791
Curses on all of you
and everything you've done.

703
01:37:45.333 --> 01:37:47.625
You're hiding other people's sins.

704
01:37:47.708 --> 01:37:49.083
Isn't that also a sin?

705
01:37:49.791 --> 01:37:53.333
We are all sinners…

706
01:37:53.416 --> 01:37:56.750
who seeks forgiveness from Allah.

707
01:37:56.833 --> 01:37:57.791
But you…

708
01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:01.666
will never get my forgiveness!

709
01:38:09.958 --> 01:38:14.208
Wahid! Wahid. stop it!

710
01:38:14.291 --> 01:38:17.791
-Wahid. that's your father!
-Wahid!

711
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:21.916
Wahid!

712
01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:24.083
Stop it. Wahid!

713
01:38:24.166 --> 01:38:27.000
Get a grip. Wahid!

714
01:38:27.083 --> 01:38:29.833
Open your eyes!

715
01:38:29.916 --> 01:38:31.583
Seek forgiveness. son!

716
01:38:33.250 --> 01:38:35.708
Please forgive me. Father.

717
01:38:38.166 --> 01:38:39.708
I deserve to die!

718
01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:42.875
I deserve to die!

719
01:38:42.958 --> 01:38:44.833
Seek forgiveness. Wahid!

720
01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:48.708
Wahid!

721
01:38:56.041 --> 01:38:57.083
Sentot!

722
01:38:57.875 --> 01:39:00.208
-Sentot!
-They deserved to die.

723
01:39:01.291 --> 01:39:04.500
We have no right
to decide who should die. Ayu.

724
01:39:05.833 --> 01:39:07.208
Yeah. but they got to decide…

725
01:39:09.666 --> 01:39:11.541
if my father would live or die.

726
01:39:14.166 --> 01:39:16.291
Now what do you want to say?

727
01:40:43.291 --> 01:40:48.000
Khanzab is an evil spirit
who disturbs people during prayer.

728
01:40:48.958 --> 01:40:52.833
However. the one who approaches you
isn't just Khanzab.

729
01:40:54.041 --> 01:40:57.416
It's actually darker beings

730
01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:01.333
that used Khanzab as a way

731
01:41:01.416 --> 01:41:05.125
to take full control of your body.

732
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:08.500
And these beings…

733
01:41:09.666 --> 01:41:12.625
have an evil side

734
01:41:13.333 --> 01:41:15.958
that is in every person.

735
01:41:17.416 --> 01:41:20.375
But can you really expel them?

736
01:41:21.166 --> 01:41:24.500
Or can you control them?

737
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.875
I surrender myself to Allah.

738
01:41:30.625 --> 01:41:32.958
The ruler of heaven and earth.

739
01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:39.208
Devils live in our hearts
where we feel revenge and anger.

740
01:41:39.291 --> 01:41:41.833
You have to be able
to let go of these feelings.

741
01:41:41.916 --> 01:41:46.708
including your anger at Sarwo
and everyone else who has hurt you.

742
01:41:47.541 --> 01:41:49.791
The key lies in one thing.

743
01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.291
you must decide for yourself…

744
01:41:55.208 --> 01:42:00.875
how you will utilize the ability
that Allah has bestowed upon you.

745
01:42:05.541 --> 01:42:06.625
Ratman?

746
01:42:08.625 --> 01:42:09.750
Rahayu.

747
01:42:11.458 --> 01:42:12.875
Are you feeling better now?

748
01:42:16.666 --> 01:42:17.750
Yeah.

749
01:42:18.416 --> 01:42:19.583
Thankfully.

750
01:42:22.083 --> 01:42:24.416
-Then. see you again.
-Take care.

751
01:42:34.333 --> 01:42:35.583
So you're here?

752
01:42:37.375 --> 01:42:38.458
Yeah.

753
01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.083
I grew up here.

754
01:42:42.666 --> 01:42:46.625
Mr. Heri called and asked me
to help out around this place.

755
01:42:46.708 --> 01:42:48.291
since Mr. Sentot had died.

756
01:42:57.791 --> 01:42:58.625
Ayu…

757
01:42:59.625 --> 01:43:01.041
I'm sorry for your loss.

758
01:43:15.125 --> 01:43:18.125
"So establish prayer. pay alms-tax.
and hold fast to Allah.

759
01:43:18.208 --> 01:43:22.458
He alone is your Guardian.

760
01:43:22.541 --> 01:43:28.375
What an excellent Guardian.
and what an excellent Helper."

761
01:43:28.458 --> 01:43:30.083
Surah Al-Hajj. 78
