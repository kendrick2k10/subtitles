3
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:30.731
It's a way of life.

4
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:35.831
A way of thinking.

5
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:41.054
When you born into it.

6
00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:45.841
it's in your DNA.

7
00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:51.873
You can't just walk away.

8
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:57.044
regardless of how hard you try.

9
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:02.651
And the undercurrent is so strong

10
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:07.551
that you consciously make bad decisions.

11
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.900
fully aware of the consequences.

12
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:17.631
But occasionally you cross
paths with someone special.

13
00:01:19.907 --> 00:01:24.657
someone who was born under
the same circumstances as you.

14
00:01:25.604 --> 00:01:30.206
But it's clear they belong
in another dimension.

15
00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.589
somewhere amongst the stars.

16
00:01:34.535 --> 00:01:36.886
but trapped in a human body.

17
00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:41.547
When you meet such a person.

18
00:01:41.597 --> 00:01:44.137
don't be jealous or envious.

19
00:01:46.884 --> 00:01:48.707
Just do all within your power

20
00:01:48.757 --> 00:01:52.257
to help them realize their full potential.

21
00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:15.384
So you think smoking weed is wrong?

22
00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:20.450
I don't know. I mean
it's illegal. right?

23
00:02:21.717 --> 00:02:23.800
Oh so. if it's illegal.

24
00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.187
then it's wrong?

25
00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:30.707
Hm. I don't know what
I'm saying right now.

26
00:02:30.757 --> 00:02:32.257
What's your point?

27
00:02:33.107 --> 00:02:35.115
Think about it.

28
00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:39.832
How could something that make
you feel so good be wrong?

29
00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:48.584
You know Doc?

30
00:02:48.608 --> 00:02:50.301
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

31
00:02:50.325 --> 00:02:52.707
You're low key blowing my high.

32
00:02:52.757 --> 00:02:55.566
Oh. so you smoke weed to get high?

33
00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:57.257
That's the point. isn't it?

34
00:02:57.307 --> 00:02:58.905
Now see.

35
00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:00.622
that's your problem.

36
00:03:01.543 --> 00:03:05.012
You smoke weed to escape your problems.

37
00:03:05.062 --> 00:03:07.479
When I come down off my high.

38
00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:10.545
I'm still high.

39
00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:14.805
'Cause I'm high on life.

40
00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:16.144
Man. that is bull shit.

41
00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:19.006
'Cause every time I come
over here your high.

42
00:03:19.056 --> 00:03:20.954
So what are you talking about?

43
00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:25.635
So you think because I'm
blind that I don't see shit?

44
00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:26.795
All right. fine.

45
00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:30.235
Tell me what finger I'm holding up then.

46
00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:34.052
I might can't see what
finger you holding up.

47
00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:37.602
but I can see you approaching a crossroad.

48
00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:41.835
A crossroad?

49
00:03:41.885 --> 00:03:43.552
Yeah. a crossroad.

Got you.

202
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:20.102
What was that about?

203
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:23.856
Nothing.

204
00:11:23.906 --> 00:11:26.818
So why did you and Mello go outside?

205
00:11:26.868 --> 00:11:29.285
Lisa just back off alright.

206
00:11:55.018 --> 00:11:58.768
Look. I'm sorry for
yelling at you alright.

207
00:12:02.427 --> 00:12:03.768
Mello told me something.

208
00:12:03.818 --> 00:12:05.777
Somebody broke into
the store or something.

209
00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:07.788
Oh my God. How bad was it?

210
00:12:07.838 --> 00:12:08.898
I don't know.

211
00:12:08.948 --> 00:12:09.914
I just.

212
00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:13.528
I don't think they got anything
but I gotta go check it out.

213
00:12:13.578 --> 00:12:14.745
That's good.

214
00:12:18.218 --> 00:12:19.175
I gotta go.

215
00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:21.854
You not staying for breakfast.

216
00:12:21.904 --> 00:12:23.977
Just keep it warm for me alright.

217
00:12:24.027 --> 00:12:25.417
Alright.

218
00:12:25.467 --> 00:12:26.467
I got you.

219
00:12:57.587 --> 00:12:58.775
Have a seat.

220
00:12:58.825 --> 00:13:01.267
What's going on Cap?

221
00:13:01.317 --> 00:13:02.467
Dino's dead.

222
00:13:02.517 --> 00:13:03.424
What?

223
00:13:03.448 --> 00:13:05.615
They got him last night?

224
00:13:06.728 --> 00:13:08.785
I'm not surprised Cap.

225
00:13:08.835 --> 00:13:11.297
Dino was a loose cannon.

226
00:13:11.347 --> 00:13:14.095
Dre wants a war. You
got any other leads?

227
00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:17.776
If not. those dead bodies
are gonna start piling up.

228
00:13:17.826 --> 00:13:18.826
On Dre?

229
00:13:19.896 --> 00:13:20.979
Let me think.

230
00:13:28.971 --> 00:13:30.746
I think I can get to Deuce's wife.

231
00:13:30.796 --> 00:13:31.796
Really?

232
00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:35.165
Yeah. she wants him to go straight.

233
00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:37.455
Dino told me in our last conversation.

234
00:13:37.505 --> 00:13:39.255
Alright. go for it.

235
00:13:42.732 --> 00:13:44.826
I got you Cap.

236
00:13:51.527 --> 00:13:52.336
The home side

237
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.237
has something going now
and the crowd is loving it.

238
00:13:56.287 --> 00:13:57.925
It's the bottom of the eighth inning

239
00:13:57.975 --> 00:14:01.225
and so far it's been a very tight game.

240
00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:06.817
Hey baby.

241
00:14:06.841 --> 00:14:08.758
Hey. what's going on?

242
00:14:15.233 --> 00:14:16.233
You okay?

243
00:14:21.704 --> 00:14:23.325
We need to talk.

244
00:14:23.375 --> 00:14:24.458
About what?

245
00:14:27.162 --> 00:14:31.443
I knew what I was getting
into. Married a cop.

246
00:14:31.493 --> 00:14:34.576
I even prepared myself for the worst.

247
00:14:36.802 --> 00:14:40.135
But now that we have a child on the way.

248
00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:46.352
I don't know what I would
do if you didn't come home.

249
00:14:46.402 --> 00:14:48.652
Like it is freaking me out.

250
00:14:50.464 --> 00:14:52.714
Has that crossed your mind?

251
00:15:35.232 --> 00:15:38.732
Listen Ray. I just wanna know the truth.

252
00:15:39.631 --> 00:15:41.702
The truth about what?

253
00:15:41.752 --> 00:15:44.419
How involved are you with Dre?

254
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.574
It's not fair.

255
00:15:47.624 --> 00:15:50.022
If I give you my heart. then
I deserve to know the truth

256
00:15:50.072 --> 00:15:52.552
and what I'm getting myself into.

257
00:15:52.602 --> 00:15:54.312
Okay. All right.

258
00:15:54.362 --> 00:15:56.912
I drive for him and don't
even gimme that man.

259
00:15:56.962 --> 00:15:59.494
He pays for my studio
time and household music

260
00:15:59.544 --> 00:16:03.171
and that's my music videos.
Okay. we're also friends.

261
00:16:03.221 --> 00:16:04.221
That's it.

262
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.317
Just please.

263
00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:16.222
just promise me you'll
stop driving for him

264
00:16:16.272 --> 00:16:18.439
after the project is done.

265
00:16:19.672 --> 00:16:20.672
I promise.

266
00:17:20.095 --> 00:17:21.095
What's up?

267
00:17:22.002 --> 00:17:24.169
So they want a war. huh?

268
00:17:26.787 --> 00:17:29.600
How you think we should handle this?

269
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:34.067
Look. I got a couple
investment properties. family.

270
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.940
Getting tired of this shit.

271
00:17:39.997 --> 00:17:43.160
Sh. people dying from nothing.

272
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.210
Nothing?

273
00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:48.629
You call 30 thousand a day nothing?

274
00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:49.488
How the fuck you think

275
00:17:49.512 --> 00:17:52.762

276
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.903
Look. handle your business or I will.

277
00:17:59.042 --> 00:17:59.851
You promised me

278
00:17:59.875 --> 00:18:01.930
that you were cutting that shit lose.

279
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.977
I am. I just need a
little bit of time that's all.

280
00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:05.076
You're getting
too old for this shit.

281
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.436
I'm not trying to raise our kids alone.

282
00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.710
Lisa!

283
00:18:34.671 --> 00:18:35.810
What is it?

284
00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.317
So what is it gonna be Deuce?

285
00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.950
What are we talking about?

286
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.659
I drove by the store today.

287
00:18:40.709 --> 00:18:44.019
It didn't look like anyone
was trying to break in.

288
00:18:44.069 --> 00:18:46.569
Look Deuce. we've been
together since high school.

289
00:18:46.619 --> 00:18:48.969
I've given you two kids.
you've never lied to me.

290
00:18:49.019 --> 00:18:50.929
So please don't start now.

291
00:18:50.979 --> 00:18:53.198
I can't tell you what's
going on right now Lisa.

292
00:18:53.248 --> 00:18:55.458
I just need you to trust me.

293
00:18:55.508 --> 00:18:58.310
You promised me that you
were cutting that shit loose.

294
00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.068
I am. I just need a little
bit of time that's all.

295
00:19:01.118 --> 00:19:02.445
We're getting too old for this shit.

296
00:19:02.469 --> 00:19:03.736
I'm not trying to raise our kids alone.

297
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.760

298
00:19:07.096 --> 00:19:10.929

Yes.

301
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:06.080
I'm Detective Johnson. That's
my partner Detective Beasley.

302
00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:07.589
Okay.

303
00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:09.349
Look. I'm not trying to harass you.

304
00:20:09.399 --> 00:20:10.961
but I do have some information for you.

305
00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:13.368
I don't have time for this.
We have nothing to talk about.

306
00:20:13.392 --> 00:20:14.729
Please just listen.

307
00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:17.851
Your husband. he's caught in
the middle of a street war.

308
00:20:17.901 --> 00:20:21.107
I know he doesn't wanna
be involved. but he is.

309
00:20:21.157 --> 00:20:22.859
And they're forcing his hand.

310
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:24.742
Here. take our card.

311
00:20:29.059 --> 00:20:29.975
Maybe you can give us some information

312
00:20:29.999 --> 00:20:32.339
to help us. help Deuce.

313
00:20:32.389 --> 00:20:34.110
Take a look around.

314
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.601
the world's a ugly place.

315
00:20:36.651 --> 00:20:38.901
There's no time for widows.

316
00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:00.921
Nice move.

317
00:21:44.282 --> 00:21:45.580
Yo. From this day forward.

318
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.380
every breath he take is numbered.

319
00:21:51.242 --> 00:21:52.261
Ah fuck that nigga man.

320
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:53.872
Puss ass nigga.

We gonna shut this shit down.

322
00:21:58.533 --> 00:22:03.533
After that everybody will
know who the real king pin is.

323
00:22:26.562 --> 00:22:29.373
Ray baby. Can you
come here for a minute?

324
00:22:29.423 --> 00:22:32.110
It's like every time I
try to leave this house.

325
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.410
Just bring your ass here.

326
00:22:39.423 --> 00:22:40.581
Yes.

327
00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:42.464
I'm so proud of you.

328
00:22:43.311 --> 00:22:44.421
For what?

329
00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:46.701
Cause your ass met your curfew.

330
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.043
I am just excited every day.

331
00:22:55.971 --> 00:22:56.971
I guess.

332
00:22:57.693 --> 00:22:59.032
I don't mean to be so rough.

333
00:22:59.082 --> 00:23:01.672
but I just don't want
nothing to happen to you

334
00:23:01.722 --> 00:23:03.043
like your brother.

335
00:23:03.093 --> 00:23:05.203
Hm. I mean. I get it.

336
00:23:05.253 --> 00:23:06.253
Come here.

337
00:23:07.662 --> 00:23:09.793
I love you so much son.

338
00:23:09.843 --> 00:23:11.343
That's so sweet.

339
00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:17.528
And where is your ass going?

340
00:23:17.578 --> 00:23:18.589
To the mall?

341
00:23:18.639 --> 00:23:19.709
With who?

342
00:23:19.759 --> 00:23:21.741
My crew. Mom.

343
00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:22.791
Mm.

344
00:23:23.559 --> 00:23:24.906
You see that shit?

345
00:23:24.956 --> 00:23:27.528
Your black ass better be in here by dark.

346
00:23:27.578 --> 00:23:28.989
I know. I know.

347
00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:30.039

348
00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:32.559

Yes. Go now and follow her ass.

353
00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:43.770
My life don't revolve around her.

354
00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.153
Today it does.

355
00:25:33.563 --> 00:25:34.563

358
00:25:37.157 --> 00:25:37.966

359
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.986

361
00:25:40.079 --> 00:25:40.946
Hell yeah.

362
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:41.844
Say less then.

363
00:25:41.868 --> 00:25:42.951
Let's ride.

364
00:25:43.827 --> 00:25:45.576
Hey. you got a sec?

365
00:25:45.626 --> 00:25:46.626
What up?

366
00:25:47.999 --> 00:25:51.029
I gotta know. how long
am I gonna be driving?

367
00:25:51.079 --> 00:25:53.827
What you worried about
your future with me man?

368
00:25:53.877 --> 00:25:54.989
Yeah. I guess.

369
00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:56.130
I understand though. man.

370
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.404
But you know me. I believe in you.

371
00:25:57.428 --> 00:25:59.004
Why don't you think I believe in you man?

372
00:25:59.028 --> 00:25:59.837
You know what I mean?

373
00:25:59.861 --> 00:26:00.670
Because you the only one I know

374
00:26:00.694 --> 00:26:01.836
who can get out this business man.

375
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.669
You know what I mean?

376
00:26:02.693 --> 00:26:03.746
Get out what you doing man?

377
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.480
Why you think I got you driving?

378
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.749
You know what I mean?

379
00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:09.249
Letting you know there's
nothing free in this world. man.

380
00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:10.978
You know what I'm saying? You feel me?

381
00:26:11.028 --> 00:26:12.028
You right.

382
00:26:13.148 --> 00:26:14.866
You know your key man.
You know what I mean?

383
00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.758
I got your back don't worry
about it man. let's go.

384
00:26:52.524 --> 00:26:53.690
Unit two 61.

385
00:26:53.714 --> 00:26:56.485
You have a domestic
disturbance in progress.

386
00:26:56.535 --> 00:27:00.285
1 o 6 3 7 Birmingham
Avenue. Apartment 1 0 2.

387
00:27:20.823 --> 00:27:21.632
Unit two 61

388
00:27:21.656 --> 00:27:23.521
Hold on. hold on. hold on.

389
00:27:23.571 --> 00:27:26.241
Stand
by for an address change.

390
00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:27.458
Standing by.

391
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:32.067
The correct address is

392
00:27:32.091 --> 00:27:34.424
1 o 6 3 6 Birmingham Street.

393
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:37.193
Apartment 1 0 2.

394
00:27:37.243 --> 00:27:38.243
Copy that.

395
00:27:41.163 --> 00:27:42.942
A newbie huh.

396
00:27:42.992 --> 00:27:43.992
Yeah.

397
00:28:05.176 --> 00:28:07.342
Seven Dead.

398
00:28:07.392 --> 00:28:08.392
The crazy part is.

399
00:28:08.421 --> 00:28:09.907
we were right there in
front of the building

400
00:28:09.931 --> 00:28:12.881
on a domestic violence call.

401
00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:17.038
but dispatch rerouted us
because of a wrong address.

402
00:28:17.088 --> 00:28:21.150
Look. is there anything
we can do to stop this war?

403
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.930
I have an idea.

404
00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.401
We can take Deuce down now.

405
00:28:25.451 --> 00:28:26.862
We'll probably lose K P.

406
00:28:26.912 --> 00:28:30.102
but it'll stop a lot of the violence.

407
00:28:30.152 --> 00:28:32.251
I don't think we have a choice guys.

408
00:28:32.301 --> 00:28:34.718
When can you take Deuce down?

409
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:38.588
I think we should lean on Deuce's wife.

410
00:28:38.638 --> 00:28:42.102
We tell her the truth.
that Deuce is in danger.

411
00:28:42.152 --> 00:28:42.996
that she get us some leverage

412
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.300
and she can tell us
everything that she knows.

413
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:49.910
Maybe we can also get a inside
track on the next showdown.

414
00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.041
What do you think Roland?

415
00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.241
I think it's worth a try.

416
00:28:56.291 --> 00:28:57.520
Okay. if that doesn't work.

417
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.131
let's take Deuce off the streets.

418
00:29:00.181 --> 00:29:01.181
Copy that.

419
00:29:02.349 --> 00:29:03.349
Yes sir.

420
00:29:23.788 --> 00:29:24.971
Lisa.

421
00:29:25.021 --> 00:29:28.419
That war we warned you
about. it's already started.

422
00:29:28.469 --> 00:29:30.801
One of Deuce's distro spots has been hit

423
00:29:30.851 --> 00:29:33.019
and seven people were killed.

424
00:29:33.069 --> 00:29:36.851
They're coming after Deuce.
It's only a matter of time.

425
00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:38.907
Deuce doesn't tell me
anything about his business.

426
00:29:38.931 --> 00:29:40.651
That was a part of the deal.

427
00:29:40.701 --> 00:29:44.371
We understand that. But in
order for us to help Deuce.

428
00:29:44.421 --> 00:29:46.571
we're gonna need somebody
to break that deal.

429
00:29:46.621 --> 00:29:50.059
What are you saying? You want
me to snitch on my husband.

430
00:29:50.109 --> 00:29:51.004
Snitch?

431
00:29:51.028 --> 00:29:53.439
We already know what your husband does.

432
00:29:53.489 --> 00:29:55.350
So why haven't you arrested him then?

433
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.779
Because it's not him that
we want. It's his boss K P.

434
00:29:58.829 --> 00:30:00.505
And we just here so that
you and your children

435
00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:03.196
do not become casualties of war.

436
00:30:08.301 --> 00:30:09.761
Look.

437
00:30:09.811 --> 00:30:11.405
we're gonna need you to
dig a little bit deeper

438
00:30:11.429 --> 00:30:13.790
and see what you can find out.

439
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.691
You still have our card?

440
00:30:33.961 --> 00:30:36.544
How many girlfriends you got?

441
00:30:37.381 --> 00:30:38.381
I mean I.

442
00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:41.601
I would just say I have
like this one shorty

443
00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:43.929
I'm messing with. you feel me?

444
00:30:43.979 --> 00:30:45.681
Y'all fuckin'?

445
00:30:45.731 --> 00:30:47.398
I mean. hell yeah.

446
00:30:51.043 --> 00:30:52.793
You use protection?

447
00:30:54.021 --> 00:30:58.131
What you my father now?
Of course I use protection.

448
00:30:58.181 --> 00:30:59.181
Why?

449
00:31:02.331 --> 00:31:04.153
I tell you why.

450
00:31:04.203 --> 00:31:08.782
Because that's probably what
your parents taught you. right?

451
00:31:08.832 --> 00:31:12.415
And it's probably what
society taught them.

452
00:31:13.363 --> 00:31:14.702
I mean. what's wrong with that?

453
00:31:14.752 --> 00:31:18.002
I mean. it is for your own good. right?

454
00:31:19.523 --> 00:31:21.651
Rubber to skin.

455
00:31:21.701 --> 00:31:24.193
That shit ain't natural.

456
00:31:24.243 --> 00:31:25.660
Now skin to skin.

457
00:31:27.043 --> 00:31:29.543
that's where it's meant to be.

458
00:31:32.131 --> 00:31:36.401
The problem is y'all wanna
fuck everything in a skirt

459
00:31:36.451 --> 00:31:37.534
and two legs.

460
00:31:39.751 --> 00:31:41.834
That shits for the birds.

461
00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.570
And what do birds do?

462
00:31:45.771 --> 00:31:47.188
They spread shit.

463
00:31:49.003 --> 00:31:51.531
Find yourself a girl. man.

464
00:31:51.581 --> 00:31:53.664
A eagle. someone special.

465
00:31:56.152 --> 00:32:00.319
Someone that you can trust.
and she can trust you.

466
00:32:02.843 --> 00:32:06.251
And y'all keep that shit on lock.

467
00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:07.770
Tight.

468
00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.631
That's what it's meant to be.

469
00:32:10.681 --> 00:32:12.848
Fuck all that condom shit.

470
00:32:45.678 --> 00:32:46.534
My boy. my boy.

471
00:32:46.558 --> 00:32:47.958
What's happening baby? You alright?

472
00:32:47.988 --> 00:32:48.884

It might be hot in more
than ever ways though.

481

Them people been staring
at you for a minute. man.

482
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.131
Stay on your toe.

484
00:33:11.205 --> 00:33:12.773
Y'all need something?

485
00:33:12.823 --> 00:33:14.293

What's up?

507
00:33:55.603 --> 00:33:56.960
So the crew? Huh?

508
00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.656

So that's how it is. huh?

512
00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:06.439
Listen. it's not even

I just wanna know why you lying to mom?

514
00:34:08.667 --> 00:34:11.200
Because you know how she would react.

515
00:34:12.319 --> 00:34:13.368
Okay?

516
00:34:13.418 --> 00:34:14.768
I get it.

517
00:34:14.818 --> 00:34:17.401
But don't lie to me. All right?

518
00:34:18.238 --> 00:34:19.238
All right.

519
00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:24.559
Now call that musty boy back.

520
00:34:55.605 --> 00:34:56.886
Thank you.

521
00:34:56.936 --> 00:34:58.353
You're welcome.

00:38:09.558 --> 00:38:12.088
It didn't.

538
00:38:12.138 --> 00:38:13.268
What happened?

539
00:38:13.318 --> 00:38:17.010
Cops
were staked out in front.

540
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:20.730
They arrested a couple of the
guys that came out the house.

541
00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.140
Fuck.

542
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:23.573
What's going on man?

543
00:38:23.597 --> 00:38:24.827
Literally just woke up man.

544
00:38:24.877 --> 00:38:27.900
I feel like I was drugged or something.

545
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.548
I'll holler back.

546
00:38:29.598 --> 00:38:30.598
I'm out.

547
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:32.630
Cool.

548
00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.519
Why didn't you wake me up?

549
00:38:37.569 --> 00:38:38.569
I tried.

550
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:41.196
If I didn't know any better.

551
00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.322
I think you drug me or something.

552
00:38:43.372 --> 00:38:45.482
Yeah. And if I didn't know any better.

553
00:38:45.532 --> 00:38:50.060
I would think you promise
to move is some bullshit.

554
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:51.660
Where'd that come from?

555
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:54.602
If you can make a
bullshit comment so can I.

556
00:38:54.652 --> 00:38:56.740
You want some coffee?

557
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:57.790
Fuck you.

558
00:39:02.241 --> 00:39:03.241
Great work out there.

559
00:39:03.268 --> 00:39:04.410
Thank you Cap.

560
00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.417
Excellent John.

561
00:39:05.441 --> 00:39:06.337
Thanks Cap.

562
00:39:06.361 --> 00:39:07.361
Sit down.

563
00:39:09.889 --> 00:39:10.846
So what you got?

564
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.250
So we got the spot that
Dre's crew hangs out at

565
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.812
and we have a new informant.

566
00:39:15.862 --> 00:39:17.340
Deuce's wife.

567
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:19.080
Good call.

568
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.931
What's your next move?

569
00:39:20.981 --> 00:39:23.030
So we're gonna go stake out the spot.

570
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.551
get some ears in there.

571
00:39:24.601 --> 00:39:25.768
Sounds good.

572
00:40:01.852 --> 00:40:04.820
Just please. just promise
me you'll stop driving for him

573
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.037
after the project is done.

574
00:40:08.052 --> 00:40:09.590
I promise.

575
00:40:22.822 --> 00:40:24.270
I don't mean to be so rough.

576
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.972
but I just don't want
nothing to happen to you

577
00:40:27.022 --> 00:40:29.020
like your brother.

578
00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:30.482
I mean. I get it.

579
00:40:30.532 --> 00:40:31.532
Come here.

580
00:40:32.532 --> 00:40:35.180
I love you so much son.

581
00:40:46.902 --> 00:40:50.749
I might can't see what
finger you holding up

582
00:40:50.799 --> 00:40:54.382
but I can see you
approaching a crossroads.

583
00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.481
A crossroads?

584
00:40:58.531 --> 00:41:00.281
Yeah. a crossroads.

585
00:41:26.638 --> 00:41:29.700
Look how much longer will
you be working with Dre?

586
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.260
Why?

587
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:35.471
Everybody knows what
happened. Were you there?

588
00:41:35.521 --> 00:41:36.521
No.

589
00:41:38.852 --> 00:41:40.092
Is it really worth it?

590
00:41:40.142 --> 00:41:41.391
Why don't you just go get a job

591
00:41:41.441 --> 00:41:43.882
and pay for the rest of
the production yourself?

592
00:41:43.932 --> 00:41:45.252
Dre is making enemies

593
00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:48.282
and so will you if you
keep hanging around him.

594
00:41:54.199 --> 00:41:58.071
Look. I'm afraid and I
just don't wanna lose you.

595
00:41:58.121 --> 00:41:59.943
Then don't be afraid then.

596
00:41:59.993 --> 00:42:02.650
nothing's gonna happen.

597
00:42:15.622 --> 00:42:16.431
What's up babe?

598
00:42:16.455 --> 00:42:18.492
Hey. what's going on?

599
00:42:18.542 --> 00:42:21.252
Look. fuck the streets.

600
00:42:21.302 --> 00:42:22.308
Fuck the game.

601
00:42:22.358 --> 00:42:23.941
Fuck all that shit.

602
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.840
You and my babies. that's all I got.

603
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:32.492
Look. pack everything up.

604
00:42:32.542 --> 00:42:34.420
Sell our properties.

605
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.300
Know some people in South Carolina

606
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:39.332
could open up a barbershop or something.

607
00:42:39.382 --> 00:42:43.465

Babe.

675
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:07.051
So I just left Deuce's grave site.

676
00:47:07.101 --> 00:47:09.101
and his kids were there.

677
00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:14.840
Two of the cutest kids
I ever seen in my life.

678
00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:19.547
And all I could think
about was you and our baby.

679
00:47:19.597 --> 00:47:21.597
I can't do this no more.

680
00:47:24.261 --> 00:47:26.850
After we take K P down.

681
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.983
I'm gonna change careers.

682
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:37.336
So I believe Skinny and D Rock

683
00:47:37.386 --> 00:47:41.232
took out one of Dre's gang members. Lucky.

684
00:47:41.282 --> 00:47:44.115
He wasn't lucky that night though.

685
00:47:45.381 --> 00:47:49.072
And I believe it was Dre
who actually executed Deuce

686
00:47:49.122 --> 00:47:51.289
in a pretty much opposite.

687
00:47:53.501 --> 00:47:57.141
I suspect the hit on Lucky
was not approved by K P.

688
00:47:57.191 --> 00:48:00.560
Cause Skinny and D-Roc.
they both disappeared.

689
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:02.720
I don't think they'll be
popping up anytime soon

690
00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.032
because from what I heard.

691
00:48:04.082 --> 00:48:06.582
K P and Deuce were real close.

692
00:48:12.882 --> 00:48:14.920
Who's the question mark?

693
00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:16.411
I don't really know.

694
00:48:16.461 --> 00:48:18.207
I think it's the kid I
saw in the car that night.

695
00:48:18.231 --> 00:48:20.411
And if so. he's just a driver.

696
00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:23.091
So where do we go from here?

697
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:25.011
Well. Dre wants the world.

698
00:48:25.061 --> 00:48:27.660
He's not gonna stop until K P is dead.

699
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:28.519
And if so.

700
00:48:28.543 --> 00:48:30.920
things gonna get a lot worse
before they get better.

701
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:32.720
And your informant?

702
00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:36.080
I'm not sure. Now that her husband dead

703
00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.651
she may ghost us.

704
00:48:37.701 --> 00:48:39.868
Or she may want revenge.

705
00:48:40.808 --> 00:48:42.301
On who?

706
00:48:42.351 --> 00:48:43.660
Dre?

707
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:45.552
Not just Dre.

708
00:48:45.602 --> 00:48:47.000
Everybody.

709
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.861
The gang killed her husband.

710
00:48:49.911 --> 00:48:53.632
So you think she'd be
willing to go deeper?

711
00:48:53.682 --> 00:48:55.932
I think it's worth a try.

712
00:48:56.962 --> 00:48:58.545
Let me talk to her.

713
00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:03.838
All right. let's go for it.

714
00:49:24.282 --> 00:49:25.621
I keep wondering.

715
00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:28.849
if I had listened to you the
first time you approached me.

716
00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:32.316
would things have turned out differently.

717
00:49:33.191 --> 00:49:35.781
He was walking away you know.

718
00:49:35.831 --> 00:49:39.192
we were planning to sell our properties

719
00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:42.742
and move to South Carolina and start over.

720
00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:46.661
He wanted to open a barbershop.

721
00:49:46.711 --> 00:49:47.711
Yeah.

722
00:49:50.101 --> 00:49:52.851
I wanna help you take down K P.

723
00:49:53.821 --> 00:49:54.821
You sure.

724
00:49:56.061 --> 00:49:57.312
She trusts me.

725
00:49:57.362 --> 00:49:59.945
Her and Deuce were like family.

726
00:50:03.181 --> 00:50:04.981
I don't know ah.

727
00:50:05.031 --> 00:50:06.930
K P is ruthless and.

728
00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.461
I will wear a wire.

729
00:50:08.511 --> 00:50:11.094
You can bug my phone. anything.

730
00:50:14.842 --> 00:50:19.632
Isn't it you who told me that
now isn't a time for widows?

731
00:50:19.682 --> 00:50:24.432
Well. maybe I can help another
wife before it's too late.

732
00:50:26.751 --> 00:50:28.489
You still have Deuce's cell?

733
00:50:28.539 --> 00:50:30.031
Yes.

734
00:50:30.081 --> 00:50:31.381
Let me have it.

735
00:50:31.431 --> 00:50:32.752
We'll bug it.

736
00:50:32.802 --> 00:50:36.050
And when you invite K P
over you can offer it to her

737
00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.920
and maybe we can get some
helpful information from there.

738
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:40.131
Anything you want.

739
00:50:40.181 --> 00:50:41.181
Thank you.

740
00:50:44.209 --> 00:50:46.371
Can I ask you a question?

741
00:50:46.421 --> 00:50:47.792
Sure.

742
00:50:47.842 --> 00:50:50.842
How were you planning to help Deuce?

743
00:50:52.858 --> 00:50:55.200
Well we were gonna arrest him

744
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:58.340
and take him off the streets
until all this died down.

745
00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:00.992
What are y'all
simple asses arguing about now?

746
00:51:01.042 --> 00:51:01.851
Nothing.

747
00:51:01.875 --> 00:51:04.042
Simple ass kids.

748
00:51:12.005 --> 00:51:12.814
I wasn't

749
00:51:12.838 --> 00:51:14.304
So who's Rebecca?

750
00:51:14.354 --> 00:51:15.581
She's just my friend.

751
00:51:15.605 --> 00:51:17.759
A friend that you've
been hugging and kissing?

752
00:51:17.783 --> 00:51:19.224
I have not.

753
00:51:19.274 --> 00:51:20.453
We're not even official.

754
00:51:20.503 --> 00:51:21.312
Not official.

755
00:51:21.336 --> 00:51:22.468
Yo. we've been official for three months.

756
00:51:22.492 --> 00:51:23.301
We have not.

757
00:51:23.325 --> 00:51:25.693
Hey man. what the fuck
is going on in here man?

758
00:51:25.743 --> 00:51:26.552
Ray.

759
00:51:26.576 --> 00:51:27.760
And who the fuck are you?

760
00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.275
Ray what are you doing?

761
00:51:29.325 --> 00:51:30.820
Hey man. you gotta get outta here man.

762
00:51:30.844 --> 00:51:31.653
I'm sorry.

763
00:51:31.677 --> 00:51:33.323
Get out. I'm. I'm talking.

764
00:51:33.373 --> 00:51:34.824
Nigga did you not hear me?

765
00:51:34.874 --> 00:51:36.302
Get out the house.

766
00:51:36.352 --> 00:51:37.161
Right.

767
00:51:37.185 --> 00:51:38.915
Damn. And back to you.

768
00:51:38.965 --> 00:51:40.904
Who told you to have
some nigga in the house?

769
00:51:40.954 --> 00:51:42.784
Okay. so what. I got a boyfriend.

770
00:51:42.834 --> 00:51:45.142
At least I'm not out here on
the streets killing people.

771
00:51:45.192 --> 00:51:47.353
My God. what are you even talking about?

772
00:51:47.403 --> 00:51:49.741
We all know that Dre has been
paying for your studio time.

773
00:51:49.765 --> 00:51:53.104
That's why you drive him. Right?

774
00:51:53.154 --> 00:51:54.993
Right? And we all know what Dre does.

775
00:51:55.043 --> 00:51:57.755
No. What me and Dre do is
none of your goddamn business.

776
00:51:57.805 --> 00:51:58.824
Really. Really?

777
00:51:58.874 --> 00:52:00.714
Cause if mom knew that.
she would not say that.

778
00:52:00.743 --> 00:52:02.439
If mom knew about that
little dirty ass nigga.

779
00:52:02.463 --> 00:52:04.803
If mom fucking knew what?

780
00:52:04.853 --> 00:52:07.453
What are y'all simple
asses arguing about now?

781
00:52:07.503 --> 00:52:08.312
Nothing.

782
00:52:08.336 --> 00:52:09.836
Simple ass kids.

783
00:52:34.101 --> 00:52:36.323
Look I have something to tell you.

784
00:52:36.373 --> 00:52:37.373
What?

785
00:52:38.671 --> 00:52:39.838
Turn around.

786
00:52:43.173 --> 00:52:46.391
What? You're pregnant or something?

787
00:52:46.441 --> 00:52:47.441
Yeah.

788
00:52:48.721 --> 00:52:50.731
Wait. wait. wait.

789
00:52:50.781 --> 00:52:51.864
You for real?

790
00:52:54.082 --> 00:52:55.499
How d'you feel?

791
00:52:57.173 --> 00:52:59.072
That's what's up.

792
00:52:59.122 --> 00:53:01.860
I'm gonna have a family.

793
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:04.077
We're gonna have a family.

794
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:21.603
You know I finished my album.

795
00:53:21.653 --> 00:53:23.153
Congratulations.

796
00:53:25.242 --> 00:53:26.242
Thank you

797
00:53:28.493 --> 00:53:32.576
The girl I was telling
you about. she's pregnant.

798
00:53:33.802 --> 00:53:35.052
You love her?

799
00:53:36.671 --> 00:53:37.671
Yeah.

800
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.240
I do.

801
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:45.821
Good.

802
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.170
A young family.

803
00:53:51.071 --> 00:53:54.432
The odds are stacked against you.

804
00:53:54.482 --> 00:53:57.982
but if you love each other you'll be okay.

805
00:54:04.882 --> 00:54:06.549
What's that I smell?

806
00:54:09.093 --> 00:54:12.352
I don't know. What you smell my cologne?

807
00:54:12.402 --> 00:54:14.485
What are you afraid of?

808
00:54:16.293 --> 00:54:21.293
I'm not even going to bore you
about how I lost my eyesight.

809
00:54:21.922 --> 00:54:23.005
But like you.

810
00:54:24.042 --> 00:54:26.209
I was at a major crossroad

811
00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.047
and I took the wrong road.

812
00:54:32.492 --> 00:54:36.170
But if you lucky enough to come out alive.

813
00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:39.621
you could always get
back on the right road.

814
00:54:39.671 --> 00:54:41.421
But here's the catch.

815
00:54:42.322 --> 00:54:43.822
it won't be clean.

816
00:54:45.602 --> 00:54:49.852
You'll carry those scars
for the rest of your life.

817
00:54:55.802 --> 00:54:56.802
Got you.

818
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:06.221
You can't catch me.

819
00:55:07.359 --> 00:55:08.699
No you can't.

820
00:55:08.749 --> 00:55:10.749
Be quiet and sit down.

821
00:55:12.061 --> 00:55:13.230
You okay?

822
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.530
Yeah we good.

823
00:55:17.621 --> 00:55:18.597
Thank you.

824
00:55:18.621 --> 00:55:22.521
Yeah. there's more where that came from.

825
00:55:22.571 --> 00:55:24.481
What's going on?

826
00:55:24.531 --> 00:55:26.671
I went to Deuce phone.

827
00:55:26.721 --> 00:55:30.081
I came up on some information that. well.

828
00:55:30.131 --> 00:55:31.212
let's just say.

829
00:55:31.262 --> 00:55:35.071
this information will be more
beneficial to you than for me.

830
00:55:35.121 --> 00:55:36.911
I appreciate that.

831
00:55:36.961 --> 00:55:38.128
That was it.

832
00:55:39.521 --> 00:55:40.880
Lisa.

833
00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:44.743
I'm gonna find out who
pulled that trigger.

834
00:55:44.793 --> 00:55:45.793
Thank you.

835
00:56:14.049 --> 00:56:15.050
Ray.

836
00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:15.909
Yeah.

837
00:56:15.933 --> 00:56:16.742
Where you going?

838
00:56:16.766 --> 00:56:18.307
Going to the studio for a late session.

839
00:56:18.331 --> 00:56:20.831
Hm. be back before midnight.

840
00:56:22.233 --> 00:56:23.471
Yeah. I got you.

841
00:56:23.521 --> 00:56:24.521
Hey Ray.

842
00:56:28.011 --> 00:56:30.428
I'm really sorry about Lucky.

843
00:56:31.782 --> 00:56:33.115
It's all good.

844
00:56:56.062 --> 00:56:57.312
What's wrong?

845
00:57:00.451 --> 00:57:01.534
You're lying.

846
00:57:06.721 --> 00:57:09.888
Listen. I just miss Lucky that's it.

847
00:57:12.285 --> 00:57:16.012
Well. are you almost finished with Dre?

848
00:57:16.062 --> 00:57:19.844
Yeah. I got like one session left.

849
00:57:19.894 --> 00:57:20.977
I'm scared.

850
00:57:23.193 --> 00:57:26.113
Why? Ain't nothing to be scared of.

851
00:57:26.163 --> 00:57:27.710
Every time something good happens to me.

852
00:57:27.734 --> 00:57:30.734
something bad always has to ruin it.

853
00:57:32.014 --> 00:57:35.039
Listen. nothing's gonna happen okay.

854
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:36.089
I promise.

855
00:58:19.033 --> 00:58:19.842
We gotta go.

856
00:58:19.866 --> 00:58:21.366
It's going down.

857
00:59:26.415 --> 00:59:27.224
Fuck!

858
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:13.841
Now I know what you're thinking.

859
01:00:13.891 --> 01:00:16.474
Why couldn't he just walk away?

860
01:01:00.483 --> 01:01:03.150
Well. how do you know he didn't?

861
01:01:12.483 --> 01:01:17.066
Now that's what will happen
if you take the wrong road.

862
01:07:38.499 --> 01:07:39.308
Fuck.

863
01:08:38.133 --> 01:08:41.272
Now. I know what you thinking.

864
01:08:41.322 --> 01:08:43.905
Why couldn't he just walk away?

865
01:09:28.973 --> 01:09:31.556
Well how do you know he didn't?

866
01:09:41.184 --> 01:09:46.184
Now that's what will happen
if you take the wrong road?
