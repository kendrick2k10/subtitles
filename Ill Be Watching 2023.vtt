3
00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:18.042
No.

4
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.917
Can I get you anything else?

5
00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:21.792
I'm fine.

6
00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:28.667
Boop.

7
00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:29.792
Oh. my god!

8
00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:31.875
Oh. thank God you came!

9
00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:33.042
Oh. my god. are
you kidding me?

10
00:02:33.042 --> 00:02:34.917
I wouldn't miss
this for the world!

11
00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:35.875
- Ugh.
- It's your big day!

12
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:38.042
Oh. my gosh. look at how
many people are here.

13
00:02:38.042 --> 00:02:40.042
I know. it's really weird.

14
00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:41.542
- Let's take an SC.
- Okay.

15
00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:42.250
Okay.

16
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.667
Looks really good.

17
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.667
Where's Marcus?

18
00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:50.917
He should be here any minute-

19
00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:53.250
Oh. This is him.

20
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.000
I'll
hold one second.

21
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.292
Hey. babe. Are
you on your way?

22
00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:00.542
I'm so. so sorry.

23
00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:03.000
I just landed in New York.

24
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.167
We had an emergency on
board and got delayed.

25
00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:06.042
I...

26
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.917
It looks like I won't
be there in time.

27
00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:12.042
Babe?

28
00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:15.750
Yeah. I'm here.

29
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:18.542
It's fine. Really.

30
00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:22.125
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:23.167
I'll keep you posted.

32
00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:25.042
I'll see you at home.

33
00:03:25.042 --> 00:03:26.375
Okay. Bye.

34
00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:29.750
Let's toast.

35
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.750
Let's.

36
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.750
To my amazing sister.

37
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.667
- Mm.
- A once art history teacher.

38
00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:37.667
Now. world famous painter.

39
00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:41.792
Cheers.

40
00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:45.750
Whoa.

41
00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:49.625
What is it? What's the matter?

42
00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:52.625
Marcus isn't coming.

43
00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:53.917
- What?
- I don't know.

44
00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:55.667
He said that he's
still at the airport

45
00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:56.917
and he's never gonna
make it on time.

46
00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:58.625
And he's only just
now telling you this?

47
00:03:58.625 --> 00:03:59.250
This is your day!

48
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.167
Rebecca. stop.

49
00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:03.667
I don't wanna get more
upset than I already am.

50
00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:05.292
It's fine.
No. it isn't.

51
00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.667
I'm really tired.

52
00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:16.167
You know. I've been
slaving away for this.

53
00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:20.292
away from you. away from my
husband. away from everyone.

54
00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:22.917
And I've been here
all fucking day.

55
00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:24.917
I don't know anyone here.

56
00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:25.917
And I just...

57
00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:27.792
What?

58
00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:29.917
Oh. my god. Oh. my god.

59
00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:31.042
What?

60
00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:32.792
I forgot Pepper's medication.

61
00:04:32.792 --> 00:04:34.167
Honey. Pepper will be fine.

62
00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:35.417
No. no. no. no. no.

63
00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:36.292
The vet said I have
to give it to him.

64
00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:37.917
I...

65
00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:39.375
You know what.
I'm gonna go home.

66
00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:41.125
- No. no. no. no. no. no.
- I'm gonna go.

67
00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:43.417
No. you're not going
anywhere. Don't be ridiculous.

68
00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:44.792
Look. I'll go home.

69
00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:46.000
I'll give Pepper

70
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.792
his medication.
No. I'm not gonna

71
00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:47.875
make you do that.

72
00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:49.292
What? No. it's fine.

73
00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:52.292
I'll be right back and
we will celebrate you.

74
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.875
Properly. okay?

75
00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:54.875
Julie.

76
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.417
- Hi.
- Hey.

77
00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:01.167
I would like to introduce you
to those people over there.

78
00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.417
They love your art.

79
00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:03.750
- Oh.
- And they're so excited

80
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.000
to meet you.

81
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.125
And most importantly. they're
ready to write you a check.

82
00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:10.875
Um. uh. okay.
I'll be one second.

83
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.000
Just one.

84
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Okay. okay. you
stay. you mingle.

85
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.750
and you get the monies.

86
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.875
And I'll be right
back. all right?

87
00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:20.000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

88
00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:22.375
- Mwah.
- All right. security code.

89
00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:23.292
Same?
Still the same. yeah. yeah.

90
00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:24.792
Mwah. See you later.

91
00:05:29.042 --> 00:05:29.917
Okay.

92
00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:33.792
Let's make some money.

93
00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.292
Hi.
Hi. how are you?

94
00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:36.417
Hey.

95
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.000
Pepper. you little shit.

96
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.125
You scared me.

97
00:06:02.042 --> 00:06:03.167
Yes. you did.

98
00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:05.167
Oh. you're so cute.

99
00:06:26.917 --> 00:06:28.250
Get off of me!

100
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.917
Get off me!

101
00:07:02.292 --> 00:07:04.250
911.
What's your emergency?

102
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.125
Hello?

103
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.917
911. What's your emergency?

104
00:07:09.917 --> 00:07:13.917
Hello?

105
00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:25.500
How is it healing?

106
00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:31.042
Uh. it's okay.

107
00:07:31.042 --> 00:07:32.500
Pain meds help.

108
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.417
Another reason why not
to mix pills and alcohol.

109
00:07:35.417 --> 00:07:37.375
I didn't trip
because I was high.

110
00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:40.292
I tripped because of your
stupid robot vacuum cleaner.

111
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Look. I'm worried. She's
mixing pills and alcohol again.

112
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.542
I have a lot of anxiety
and I'm not sleeping.

113
00:07:48.542 --> 00:07:51.500
Julie. we've
talked about this.

114
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.917
I know you need
to take some pills

115
00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:58.500
for your pain and for your
anxiety. but until you heal.

116
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.167
it would be best if you
didn't drink any alcohol.

117
00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:02.875
It really is dangerous.

118
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.042
The break-in.
it was a tragedy.

119
00:08:05.042 --> 00:08:08.125
And Rebecca. she didn't
deserve to die that way.

120
00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:10.167
but it has been five months

121
00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:11.875
and I would like my
wife back. you know?

122
00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:13.042
She needs to...

123
00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:17.417
We need to move on.

124
00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:20.875
Should have been
me that night.

125
00:08:23.375 --> 00:08:25.417
I understand.

126
00:08:25.417 --> 00:08:27.375
You feel your guilt.

127
00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:31.167
And it is a natural
reaction to the situation.

128
00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:35.417
Grief is a process
layered with emotions.

129
00:08:35.417 --> 00:08:37.667
and in order to get through it.

130
00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:41.000
you have to accept and
deal with those emotions.

131
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.375
It is going to take some time.

132
00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:44.625
You will get there.

133
00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:46.917
Yeah. no. I understand that.

134
00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:48.500
You know. it was
really hard being

135
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.500
in our place after
what happened. so I
got us a new place.

136
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.750
somewhere nice and quiet
where Julie can paint

137
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.000
and. you know. I
can work from there-

138
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.417
And I said that I don't feel
comfortable moving right now.

139
00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:06.167
Well. um. relocating
to a new house could help

140
00:09:06.167 --> 00:09:07.917
with the healing process.

141
00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:13.417
A new environment could
give you a new perspective

142
00:09:13.417 --> 00:09:16.500
and help you separate
the traumatic event

143
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.917
that happened to your sister

144
00:09:18.917 --> 00:09:21.375
from the actual
loss of your sister.

145
00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:25.167
I don't like the
idea of being out

146
00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:27.042
in the middle of nowhere.

147
00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:28.417
Alone.

148
00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:30.417
Yeah. but you won't be alone.

149
00:09:31.417 --> 00:09:33.042
You know. I can work from home.

150
00:09:33.042 --> 00:09:36.250
I can be there to get you
anything that you need.

151
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.292
You know. I can
finish working on Hera

152
00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:40.625
and maybe you'll get
inspired to paint and...

153
00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:44.500
Hera. that's his little
toy that plays music

154
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.375
and turns on the lights
when you ask it to.

155
00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:49.667
but when you actually
need it. it's useless.

156
00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:51.625
Okay. first off.
it's not a toy.

157
00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:53.792
And secondly. the
version that we had was

158
00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:55.125
my first prototype. okay?

159
00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:57.667
We don't know what
went wrong. exactly.

160
00:09:57.667 --> 00:10:01.000
Okay. you have no idea what
this new upgrade is capable of.

161
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.542
She can change our lives.

162
00:10:02.542 --> 00:10:04.292
He's making a big effort here.

163
00:10:05.417 --> 00:10:07.167
Can you just meet
him halfway? Hmm?

164
00:10:15.417 --> 00:10:17.542
I think this could
be really good for us.

165
00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:21.167
And I will be
there to help you.

166
00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:24.375
both. through this transition.

167
00:10:28.542 --> 00:10:30.417
Hey. Julie.

168
00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:52.042
How you liking
the new place so far?

169
00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:53.000
It's nice.

170
00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:55.667
You know. there's still
a few things to unpack.

171
00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:58.000
but I figure we can
take our time with that.

172
00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:00.500
I'm glad we're doing this.

173
00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:02.792
Me too.

174
00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:31.375
You won't have to lift
a finger. I promise.

175
00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:32.250
Okay.

176
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.250
Oh. god. there's so many boxes.

177
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.417
Can't wait until

178
00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:49.250
we get unpacked.

179
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.667
Yeah. we'll get there.

180
00:11:50.667 --> 00:11:52.792
Oh. you're gonna
love the new Hera.

181
00:11:52.792 --> 00:11:53.667
Mm-hmm.

182
00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:58.542
Who's that?

183
00:11:58.542 --> 00:11:59.750
It's Sophie.

184
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.542
Um. I'm gonna go upstairs.

185
00:12:01.542 --> 00:12:02.625
but you let me know
when you're ready?

186
00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:04.167
- Mm-hmm. yeah.
- Okay.

187
00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:08.125
Hi.
Hey. how's it going?

188
00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:09.667
I have been dying
over here for details.

189
00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:12.125
You left so mysteriously.

190
00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:14.250
I know. It's good. it's good.

191
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.042
I mean. the house
is really nice.

192
00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:18.750
I just can't wait until
we're unpacked though

193
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.167
because there's shit everywhere.

194
00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:24.417
So you decided which room
you're gonna have sex in first?

195
00:12:24.417 --> 00:12:25.875
Sophie. come on.

196
00:12:25.875 --> 00:12:27.375
You guys still
aren't getting along?

197
00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:29.792
Hey. you know. the best solution

198
00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:33.792
to. mm. everything
is a good orgasm.

199
00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:36.417
- Really?
- Yes. really.

200
00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:38.417
How the hell do you think
I've been married so long?

201
00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:41.292
I don't know. Soph. I just...

202
00:12:41.292 --> 00:12:43.292
I feel so...

203
00:12:44.667 --> 00:12:46.792
Hey. you are not alone.

204
00:12:46.792 --> 00:12:49.792
I am here for you. Just make
the most of your time together.

205
00:12:49.792 --> 00:12:51.417
Okay.

206
00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:53.417
I will. Thanks. Soph.

207
00:12:53.417 --> 00:12:54.292
Bye.
Bye.

208
00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:00.250
Okay.

209
00:13:01.875 --> 00:13:02.667
Working.

210
00:13:03.917 --> 00:13:07.417
Hey. Jules. come downstairs.
I wanna show you something.

211
00:13:07.417 --> 00:13:08.292
Okay.

212
00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:13.667
Um. let me see your phone?

213
00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:14.542
- Okay.
- Yeah.

214
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.542
I just wanna make sure that you
are connected to everything.

215
00:13:20.542 --> 00:13:21.667
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

216
00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:23.792
Okay.

217
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.292
This is Hera.

218
00:13:28.292 --> 00:13:29.875
She controls all the apps
and the alarm system.

219
00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.167
Now. when you leave the
house. it'll turn on.

220
00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:33.417
Okay.

221
00:13:33.417 --> 00:13:35.292
And. you know. if you're home
alone. you can leave it on.

222
00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:38.500
But if a window or a door
opens. the alarm will go off.

223
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.917
And if you don't turn it
off within five minutes.

224
00:13:39.917 --> 00:13:42.292
Hera will get the cops
to come and check on you.

225
00:13:42.292 --> 00:13:43.417
Okay. that's good.

226
00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:44.792
Good. good. now. you can lock

227
00:13:44.792 --> 00:13:47.292
and unlock the doors
from your phone

228
00:13:47.292 --> 00:13:49.792
or. you know. the
tablet. the wall panels.

229
00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:51.542
- Mm-hmm.
- Now. this app.

230
00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:53.917
this app starts the
car from a distance.

231
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.417
Why would I need that?

232
00:13:56.417 --> 00:13:57.375
Oh. I don't know.

233
00:13:57.375 --> 00:13:58.792
You might wanna put the AC on

234
00:13:58.792 --> 00:14:00.000
before getting in. for instance?

235
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.417
Right.

236
00:14:01.417 --> 00:14:03.417
Right. okay. well. this app.

237
00:14:03.417 --> 00:14:05.292
this app starts the
washing machine.

238
00:14:06.542 --> 00:14:07.792
Okay. because pushing a button

239
00:14:07.792 --> 00:14:09.792
on a washing machine is so hard?

240
00:14:09.792 --> 00:14:12.500
Jules. don't fight technology.

241
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.417
Now. on this. and your phone.

242
00:14:14.417 --> 00:14:18.292
you can check all the cameras
that are in the house.

243
00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:23.000
So there and there. and
outside the house too.

244
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.375
Okay.

245
00:14:24.375 --> 00:14:25.792
Who else can see this?

246
00:14:25.792 --> 00:14:27.375
Um. it's only you and me.

247
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.542
Oh. what about my sessions
with Dr. Tate? They're private.

248
00:14:31.542 --> 00:14:33.042
Yeah. uh. just
tell Hera to turn

249
00:14:33.042 --> 00:14:34.792
the sound and the
microphone off in the room

250
00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:36.667
that you're doing the
session with Dr. Tate in.

251
00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:38.000
- Okay.
- Yeah.

252
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.875
Okay.

253
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.500
Hello. Hera.

254
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.792
Hello. Marcus.

255
00:14:47.792 --> 00:14:50.292
It is nice to finally be back.

256
00:14:50.292 --> 00:14:53.292
Hey. Hera. you remember
my wife Julie. don't you?

257
00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:55.542
I do. Hello. Julie.

258
00:14:57.792 --> 00:14:58.667
Well?

259
00:14:59.542 --> 00:15:01.292
"Well." what?

260
00:15:01.292 --> 00:15:03.292
Say hello to Hera.

261
00:15:03.292 --> 00:15:04.292
Are you serious?

262
00:15:04.292 --> 00:15:05.542
Yes. I'm serious.

263
00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:07.917
Hello. Hera.

264
00:15:09.042 --> 00:15:12.542
Hera. it's a bit stuffy in
here. Can you adjust the AC?

265
00:15:13.542 --> 00:15:15.000
Of course.

266
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.417
Mm. Thank you. darling.

267
00:15:16.417 --> 00:15:18.042
It's so good to have you back.

268
00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:20.625
My pleasure. Marcus.

269
00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:21.917
Should I be jealous?

270
00:15:21.917 --> 00:15:23.625
Oh. super jealous.

271
00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:25.875
Hera can control
all of this stuff.

272
00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:27.042
She can hear you
through the speakers

273
00:15:27.042 --> 00:15:29.292
and the cameras
throughout the house.

274
00:15:29.292 --> 00:15:30.625
Um. phone.

275
00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:31.917
- Oh.
- Yeah.

276
00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:33.375
Okay. I'm just gonna make sure

277
00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:34.750
that you're connected
to everything

278
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.792
and then I'll run it through
with you later. okay?

279
00:15:36.792 --> 00:15:37.667
Okay.

280
00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:51.000
I forgot milk.

281
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I'm gonna have to go to
the store and get some.

282
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.667
Hera. order milk.

283
00:15:54.667 --> 00:15:57.000
Ordering milk. Marcus.

284
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.917
That is ridiculous to just
have her order one thing.

285
00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.375
Then make a list.

286
00:16:02.417 --> 00:16:03.875
- Really?
- Mm.

287
00:16:03.875 --> 00:16:05.917
Julie. I have
monitored the items

288
00:16:05.917 --> 00:16:09.667
in the refrigerator and have
already placed a full order.

289
00:16:09.667 --> 00:16:11.792
Oh. Thank you.

290
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.042
Thanks. Hera.

291
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.917
- Hey.
- Hi.

292
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.917
I thought we...

293
00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:22.417
You thought what?

294
00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:27.125
I thought we weren't gonna
mix pills with wine anymore.

295
00:17:31.125 --> 00:17:34.417
You know what. I don't
need to be lectured.

296
00:17:35.542 --> 00:17:37.667
I don't need you or
anyone else telling me

297
00:17:37.667 --> 00:17:41.542
how to grieve or heal-

298
00:17:41.542 --> 00:17:42.542
Okay. but we agreed

299
00:17:42.542 --> 00:17:43.917
with Dr. Tate-
You know what. just drop it.

300
00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:45.417
- Jules.
- Drop it.

301
00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:59.042
Do you think what happened
to your sister was my fault?

302
00:17:59.042 --> 00:18:00.125
I didn't say that.

303
00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:04.167
You didn't have to.

304
00:18:14.167 --> 00:18:15.042
Shit.

305
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.500
Look. I'm sorry.
okay? I've been busy.

306
00:18:20.125 --> 00:18:23.167
Yeah. Yeah. I think that we
have worked out all the issues.

307
00:18:27.667 --> 00:18:29.750
Yeah. No thanks.

308
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.625
Right. Yeah.

309
00:18:31.625 --> 00:18:33.292
No. I got that. Thank you.

310
00:18:33.292 --> 00:18:34.792
No. she won't be a problem.

311
00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:38.042
Who is that?

312
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.542
The investors on the project.

313
00:18:41.542 --> 00:18:43.542
they wanna meet me in person.

314
00:18:43.542 --> 00:18:46.167
Oh. my god. Congratulations.

315
00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.667
Um. look. I-
Yeah. in Hong Kong though.

316
00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:50.792
What?

317
00:18:50.792 --> 00:18:52.667
Look. it's just
gonna be a few days.

318
00:18:52.667 --> 00:18:54.167
We just moved in.

319
00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:56.667
Well. I'll be in
constant contact. okay?

320
00:18:56.667 --> 00:18:59.792
No. Marcus. I don't
wanna be here alone.

321
00:18:59.792 --> 00:19:02.000
We talked about this.
Not after what happened.

322
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.667
Hey. Julie. you'll
be fine. okay?

323
00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:06.542
This is a top-notch
security system.

324
00:19:06.542 --> 00:19:07.292
and besides. look where we are.

325
00:19:07.292 --> 00:19:09.000
What do you think can happen?

326
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.292
Okay. the biggest crime
that happens here is

327
00:19:11.292 --> 00:19:13.125
probably speeding on
those empty streets

328
00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:15.792
or cow tipping or fraud.

329
00:19:16.667 --> 00:19:17.792
Look. you'll be fine.

330
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.125
But I gotta go.

331
00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:16.042
Morning.

332
00:20:17.042 --> 00:20:17.917
Morning.

333
00:20:20.042 --> 00:20:24.250
Hey. I gotta get
some items for travel.

334
00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.292
You gonna be okay?

335
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:27.917
Don't worry about me.

336
00:20:31.042 --> 00:20:34.250
Hera. play soft music.

337
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.625
Good morning.
Marcus. Soft music on its way.

338
00:20:43.292 --> 00:20:46.917
Hey. I got a conference
call in 10 minutes.

339
00:20:49.292 --> 00:20:50.667
Marcus. I...

340
00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:51.292
No.

341
00:20:59.792 --> 00:21:02.125
Uh. hey. you get some rest.

342
00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:05.667
I'm gonna head into
town after my call.

343
00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:08.667
so let me know if
you need anything.

344
00:21:20.917 --> 00:21:23.667
I'm here to
assist you. Julie.

345
00:21:23.667 --> 00:21:25.167
Shut the fuck up. Hera.

346
00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:16.417
Dammit. Sergeant Pepper!

347
00:23:16.417 --> 00:23:18.917
Shit.

348
00:23:18.917 --> 00:23:20.125
Hera!

349
00:23:20.125 --> 00:23:23.042
Uh...

350
00:23:27.542 --> 00:23:28.792
Pepper!

351
00:23:40.917 --> 00:23:42.917
Hi.
Hey. how's it going?

352
00:23:42.917 --> 00:23:45.292
Oh. it's going.

353
00:23:45.292 --> 00:23:46.417
What are you doing?

354
00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:50.042
I am trying to do laundry.

355
00:23:50.042 --> 00:23:52.542
Fun. How's Marcus?

356
00:23:52.542 --> 00:23:55.917
He's Marcus. He's
happy we're here.

357
00:23:55.917 --> 00:23:57.125
And you?

358
00:23:58.292 --> 00:24:01.042
I don't know yet. I
mean. it's beautiful.

359
00:24:01.042 --> 00:24:03.542
But I tried to paint yesterday

360
00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:05.417
and I just ended up
staring at the canvas

361
00:24:05.417 --> 00:24:07.125
for. like. an hour
before I gave up.

362
00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:08.917
Hey. you'll get

363
00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:10.917
your inspiration back.

364
00:24:10.917 --> 00:24:14.292
Julie. please
let me help you.

365
00:24:14.292 --> 00:24:16.000
Stand clear of the door.

366
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.417
Oh.

367
00:24:19.542 --> 00:24:21.167
Huh. Thank you.

368
00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:23.000
My pleasure. Julie.

369
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.292
Who are you talking to?

370
00:24:24.292 --> 00:24:25.917
Oh. nobody.

371
00:24:25.917 --> 00:24:28.542
It's Marcus's upgraded toy

372
00:24:28.542 --> 00:24:32.125
or. as he likes to call
it. his virtual assistant.

373
00:24:32.125 --> 00:24:33.500
Hey.
shoot. I gotta go.

374
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.917
The kids are getting
into some trouble.

375
00:24:34.917 --> 00:24:37.000
but promise you'll
call me every day.

376
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.042
- I promise.
- Okay.

377
00:24:38.042 --> 00:24:39.167
I will talk to you tomorrow.

378
00:24:39.167 --> 00:24:40.292
I love you. Bye.

379
00:24:43.667 --> 00:24:44.667
She seems fine to me.

380
00:24:44.667 --> 00:24:46.292
You leaving
after just getting there

381
00:24:46.292 --> 00:24:48.542
isn't going to be easy on her.

382
00:24:48.542 --> 00:24:51.250
She will be fine. okay?

383
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.375
I think we've made
some progress.

384
00:24:53.375 --> 00:24:55.917
Marcus. I don't
think this is a good idea.

385
00:24:55.917 --> 00:24:57.542
Can't you postpone this?

386
00:24:59.125 --> 00:25:00.417
Uh. Doc. can we postpone
my payments to you?

387
00:25:00.417 --> 00:25:02.292
You know what. why
don't we just postpone

388
00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:05.542
all my fucking expenses until
we figure this thing out?

389
00:25:05.542 --> 00:25:08.375
Look. it's only five days.
What about what I need?

390
00:25:09.667 --> 00:25:13.250
I will make it up to her
when I get back.

391
00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:15.625
You know what. I think
our session's up.

392
00:25:15.625 --> 00:25:17.375
Thank you for your time. Doctor.

393
00:25:17.375 --> 00:25:19.417
But I need to pack
for my flight.

394
00:25:19.417 --> 00:25:21.167
Marcus.

395
00:25:21.167 --> 00:25:22.042
Fuck!

396
00:25:26.667 --> 00:25:28.167
I'm home!

397
00:25:28.167 --> 00:25:29.542
In the kitchen.

398
00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:34.500
That smells delicious.

399
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.042
It'll be ready in 10.

400
00:25:39.125 --> 00:25:42.417
So how's the rest
of your morning?

401
00:25:42.417 --> 00:25:44.250
Do anything interesting?

402
00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.042
Not really.

403
00:25:46.292 --> 00:25:48.042
Still getting used
to this house.

404
00:25:48.042 --> 00:25:51.292
Mm-hmm.

405
00:25:51.292 --> 00:25:52.542
How was your meeting?

406
00:25:53.917 --> 00:25:57.042
Uh. yeah. I mean. they
loved my presentation

407
00:25:57.042 --> 00:25:59.250
and the main investor
is excited to meet me

408
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.500
when I get to Hong Kong.

409
00:26:02.042 --> 00:26:04.042
How long are you
going for again?

410
00:26:04.042 --> 00:26:06.667
Five days. So no wild parties.

411
00:26:06.667 --> 00:26:08.042
Not until I get back.

412
00:26:09.667 --> 00:26:13.417
Can you grab my pain
pills outta my purse?

413
00:26:13.417 --> 00:26:14.917
My ankle's killing me today.

414
00:26:16.167 --> 00:26:17.542
How many have you had today?

415
00:26:18.625 --> 00:26:19.917
This is my second.

416
00:26:21.042 --> 00:26:22.917
Oh. how
about just half?

417
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:24.625
Sure.

418
00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:33.417
Hey. uh. you didn't
move any crypto coins

419
00:26:33.417 --> 00:26:35.667
from our wallet
account. did you?

420
00:26:35.667 --> 00:26:36.917
No. Why?

421
00:26:38.042 --> 00:26:40.292
Well. 20K crypto
coins missing.

422
00:26:40.292 --> 00:26:44.125
Well. I wouldn't even know
what to do with crypto coin.

423
00:26:44.125 --> 00:26:49.125
I mean. did you call a bank
or wherever you keep it?

424
00:26:50.042 --> 00:26:50.667
Yeah. I'll look into it.

425
00:26:58.125 --> 00:27:00.417
Okay. well. I'll call
you when I get there.

426
00:27:00.417 --> 00:27:02.542
Okay. Well. I'll
have a safe trip.

427
00:27:02.542 --> 00:27:05.750
Marcus. it's time to go.

428
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.000
My driver's here.

429
00:27:07.667 --> 00:27:09.292
I'll miss you.

430
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.625
Well. don't worry
because I'll be watching.

431
00:27:15.625 --> 00:27:16.500
Creep.

432
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.042
Bye. Hera.

433
00:27:19.042 --> 00:27:20.292
Have fun. Marcus.

434
00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:50.792
Love you. babe.

435
00:27:50.792 --> 00:27:51.875
Love you.

436
00:27:51.875 --> 00:27:53.750
Sweet dreams. babe.

437
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.625
Okay.

438
00:29:08.292 --> 00:29:08.875
Hmm.

439
00:30:21.917 --> 00:30:24.500
Hmm.

440
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.667
Well. hello.

441
00:30:26.667 --> 00:30:30.917
Pepper. which one of these
dresses should I keep? Hmm?

442
00:30:30.917 --> 00:30:32.667
I don't need both.

443
00:30:32.667 --> 00:30:33.917
This one?

444
00:30:35.042 --> 00:30:35.875
This one?

445
00:30:37.542 --> 00:30:39.750
Okay. Okay.

446
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.542
I'm just gonna get
a second opinion.

447
00:30:46.667 --> 00:30:48.792
Hey. I have a dilemma.

448
00:30:48.792 --> 00:30:51.000
Well. you know
you make your best decisions

449
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.625
after a shot of whiskey.

450
00:30:52.625 --> 00:30:53.792
Well. I was hoping

451
00:30:53.792 --> 00:30:54.542
you could help me.

452
00:30:54.542 --> 00:30:56.375
Oh. sure.

453
00:30:56.375 --> 00:30:57.625
Yeah. I'm better than booze.

454
00:30:57.625 --> 00:31:00.542
Hey. guys. keep it
down! I'm on the phone!

455
00:31:00.542 --> 00:31:04.917
I need you to tell me which
one of these I should keep.

456
00:31:04.917 --> 00:31:06.875
Uh. none?

457
00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:09.042
What do you mean
none? I like them.

458
00:31:09.042 --> 00:31:10.667
Where are
you gonna wear them to?

459
00:31:10.667 --> 00:31:13.667
The annual harvest moon
forest gathering or...

460
00:31:13.667 --> 00:31:16.292
Okay. it's a little isolated.

461
00:31:16.292 --> 00:31:18.542
but it's not Siberia
for God's sake.

462
00:31:18.542 --> 00:31:20.750
Okay. I'm sorry.

463
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.792
I mean. the nearest
little town's 10 miles

464
00:31:22.792 --> 00:31:24.667
and the city's 30.

465
00:31:24.667 --> 00:31:25.667
It's not so bad.

466
00:31:27.042 --> 00:31:28.667
Although there's no Lyft.

467
00:31:28.667 --> 00:31:30.667
What? Okay. but Uber?

468
00:31:30.667 --> 00:31:31.667
Mm-mm.

469
00:31:31.667 --> 00:31:32.792
So where's Marcus?

470
00:31:32.792 --> 00:31:34.917
Is he playing with
his little toys?

471
00:31:34.917 --> 00:31:37.375
Uh. he just left
for Hong Kong.

472
00:31:37.375 --> 00:31:38.292
What?

473
00:31:38.292 --> 00:31:40.917
Yeah. he had to go.

474
00:31:40.917 --> 00:31:42.917
Some deal they're closing.

475
00:31:42.917 --> 00:31:45.000
Okay. well.
I'm just really surprised

476
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.417
he left you so soon.

477
00:31:46.417 --> 00:31:48.375
Yeah. I'm kinda pissed off.

478
00:31:48.375 --> 00:31:50.917
We were actually
getting closer. I think.

479
00:31:50.917 --> 00:31:54.000
Mm. but it's not
very sensitive if you ask me.

480
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.750
Hey. come and stay
with us for a few days.

481
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.875
just until he gets back.

482
00:31:57.875 --> 00:32:00.042
- I don't know.
- Come on.

483
00:32:00.042 --> 00:32:02.917
It'll be fun. I miss my roomie.

484
00:32:02.917 --> 00:32:06.042
Really? Yeah. you
know what. why not?

485
00:32:06.042 --> 00:32:07.625
Can I bring Pepper?

486
00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.292
Yeah. you better
bring that handsome boy.

487
00:32:09.292 --> 00:32:11.500
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

488
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.917
See you tomorrow!

489
00:32:17.375 --> 00:32:18.042
Okay.

490
00:32:20.375 --> 00:32:21.042
Mm.

491
00:32:22.917 --> 00:32:26.292
Hey. babe. I was just
about to tell you my plans.

492
00:32:26.292 --> 00:32:28.917
Yeah. what's going
on? You're packing a bag?

493
00:32:28.917 --> 00:32:30.125
Yeah.

494
00:32:30.125 --> 00:32:32.375
Um. I'm gonna go
and stay with Sophie

495
00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:33.875
and the kids until you get back.

496
00:32:35.125 --> 00:32:36.500
Look. Jules.
I don't feel comfortable

497
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.375
with you driving
six and a half hours

498
00:32:38.375 --> 00:32:39.875
with a broken ankle
whilst you're on meds.

499
00:32:39.875 --> 00:32:41.542
I just don't think it's safe.

500
00:32:42.917 --> 00:32:46.667
So you can have a change
of plans. but I can't?

501
00:32:46.667 --> 00:32:49.417
I don't wanna be here. Marcus.

502
00:32:49.417 --> 00:32:52.542
I'm alone and it's
quiet. I don't like it.

503
00:32:52.542 --> 00:32:53.750
Yeah.
but Dr. Tate says

504
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.000
that you need quiet right now.

505
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.042
Okay. can you please
stop doing that?

506
00:32:57.042 --> 00:32:59.667
I feel like everyone is
telling me what to do.

507
00:32:59.667 --> 00:33:01.375
Okay.
Okay. I'm sorry.

508
00:33:03.042 --> 00:33:04.500
You know I love you. right?

509
00:33:06.792 --> 00:33:08.542
Yeah. I love you too.

510
00:33:08.542 --> 00:33:10.042
And I
miss you already.

511
00:33:12.375 --> 00:33:13.542
Where are you now?

512
00:33:13.542 --> 00:33:15.875
Oh. I'm
just in my hotel room.

513
00:33:15.875 --> 00:33:17.167
What did you do today?

514
00:33:17.167 --> 00:33:18.000
Not much.

515
00:33:18.917 --> 00:33:23.042
I got to relax and.
um. I tried to paint.

516
00:33:23.042 --> 00:33:25.417
That's good.
That makes me happy.

517
00:33:26.625 --> 00:33:28.167
Okay. well. I've got a
meeting in 10 minutes.

518
00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:29.875
I just wanted to
call and say hi.

519
00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:32.042
Good luck.

520
00:33:32.042 --> 00:33:33.542
Thanks.
Talk tomorrow?

521
00:33:33.542 --> 00:33:34.417
Mm-hmm.

522
00:33:43.417 --> 00:33:44.542
I love you. Julie.

523
00:33:47.417 --> 00:33:48.417
Goodnight.

524
00:33:52.875 --> 00:33:55.542
And stop talking to me
through the cameras. please.

525
00:35:58.917 --> 00:36:00.167
Julie.

526
00:36:06.292 --> 00:36:07.167
Julie.

527
00:37:02.292 --> 00:37:03.167
Hi.

528
00:37:04.667 --> 00:37:06.042
Marcus?
Hey.

529
00:37:06.042 --> 00:37:07.917
Hey. what are you doing up
in the middle of the night?

530
00:37:07.917 --> 00:37:09.917
I was taking a nap
and Hera woke me up.

531
00:37:12.167 --> 00:37:13.625
I heard a man's voice.

532
00:37:13.625 --> 00:37:15.167
What? Who?

533
00:37:15.167 --> 00:37:16.250
I don't know. I just...

534
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.792
I know that I heard someone.

535
00:37:18.792 --> 00:37:20.167
I thought there was
someone in the house.

536
00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:21.292
Wait. wait. wait. wait. What?

537
00:37:21.292 --> 00:37:22.792
What happened? What?

538
00:37:22.792 --> 00:37:24.667
Well. I heard
him saying my name

539
00:37:24.667 --> 00:37:29.292
and then there was. like.
footsteps and glass breaking.

540
00:37:31.917 --> 00:37:33.792
Julie. you
know that's not possible.

541
00:37:33.792 --> 00:37:35.667
Well. I know what
I heard. Marcus.

542
00:37:35.667 --> 00:37:38.417
Babe. it's just another
one of your bad dreams. okay?

543
00:37:38.417 --> 00:37:41.000
No. No. no. I was awake.

544
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.292
I was. and when I heard the
glass break in the kitchen.

545
00:37:45.292 --> 00:37:49.292
I came out and
there was nothing.

546
00:37:50.417 --> 00:37:53.292
Listen.
you're stressed. okay?

547
00:37:53.292 --> 00:37:55.167
Because you're home
alone in the move and-

548
00:37:55.167 --> 00:37:56.042
No.

549
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.875
No. Marcus I heard a voice.

550
00:37:59.875 --> 00:38:01.292
Why don't you believe me?

551
00:38:01.292 --> 00:38:02.917
Julie. I can
see all the camera footage

552
00:38:02.917 --> 00:38:04.792
inside the house and
it's just you there.

553
00:38:04.792 --> 00:38:06.042
So why don't you take a pill

554
00:38:06.042 --> 00:38:08.000
and try to relax and
go back to sleep?

555
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.292
And meanwhile I'll run a
security system's check

556
00:38:10.292 --> 00:38:12.167
and make sure
everything's running fine.

557
00:38:12.167 --> 00:38:14.000
You know. maybe. maybe there was

558
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.417
some interference or something.

559
00:38:19.292 --> 00:38:20.167
Okay.

560
00:38:21.125 --> 00:38:22.292
I miss you.

561
00:38:22.292 --> 00:38:23.417
Hera. run
a full diagnostics

562
00:38:23.417 --> 00:38:25.667
on the security system
inside the house.

563
00:38:25.667 --> 00:38:29.042
I'm running a full
diagnostics now. Marcus.

564
00:38:29.042 --> 00:38:31.667
Sorry for the bother. Hera.

565
00:38:31.667 --> 00:38:33.125
No problem. Julie.

566
00:38:34.292 --> 00:38:37.292
See? Get some rest.

567
00:38:37.292 --> 00:38:38.292
Goodnight.

568
00:38:38.292 --> 00:38:40.750
Okay. goodnight.

569
00:38:47.292 --> 00:38:48.792
Pepper?

570
00:38:48.792 --> 00:38:50.167
Pepper.

571
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:52.792
Are you in the laundry?

572
00:38:54.292 --> 00:38:56.750
What are you doing
in there. silly?

573
00:38:58.792 --> 00:39:00.750
Hey. come here.

574
00:39:03.417 --> 00:39:06.042
Let's go back to bed. huh?

575
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:48.917
What the...

576
00:39:58.042 --> 00:39:59.417
Oh. Jesus Christ.

577
00:40:01.292 --> 00:40:03.042
Hera. turn off alarm.

578
00:40:05.542 --> 00:40:07.292
Hera. turn off alarm!

579
00:40:14.417 --> 00:40:18.292
Okay.

580
00:40:28.542 --> 00:40:29.917
Hello.

581
00:40:29.917 --> 00:40:33.292
Hi. Yeah. I think my
thermostat's broken.

582
00:40:33.292 --> 00:40:34.417
Actually. I know it is.

583
00:40:36.375 --> 00:40:38.417
No. it's brand new.
We just moved in.

584
00:40:40.125 --> 00:40:41.500
It's Julie Alexander.

585
00:40:43.542 --> 00:40:45.417
Today? Yeah.

586
00:40:56.417 --> 00:40:59.167
Hey. Soph. I'm so sorry.

587
00:40:59.167 --> 00:41:00.167
Hey. what's wrong?

588
00:41:00.167 --> 00:41:01.875
I thought you were coming over?

589
00:41:01.875 --> 00:41:02.875
Yeah. I know.

590
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.417
I didn't feel
comfortable driving.

591
00:41:06.417 --> 00:41:09.542
My ankle's hurting and I'm
still having nightmares.

592
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.500
It might be the pills. but...

593
00:41:13.542 --> 00:41:14.417
What?

594
00:41:16.417 --> 00:41:19.417
I thought I heard a
man's voice last night.

595
00:41:19.417 --> 00:41:22.125
Probably
just a nightmare.

596
00:41:22.125 --> 00:41:24.917
Maybe. I don't know anymore.

597
00:41:26.292 --> 00:41:28.500
Well. are you sure
your alarm system's working?

598
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.042
Yeah. Marcus checked it.

599
00:41:30.042 --> 00:41:32.167
Okay.
well get some rest

600
00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:34.292
and call me if
you need anything.

601
00:41:35.417 --> 00:41:37.917
Hey.

602
00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:44.375
Are you hungry?

603
00:41:45.542 --> 00:41:47.542
Come on.

604
00:41:48.542 --> 00:41:50.542
Yeah. there you go.

605
00:42:11.292 --> 00:42:12.167
Ugh. Hera.

606
00:42:13.167 --> 00:42:14.542
I'm the technician!

607
00:42:14.542 --> 00:42:17.042
I know! Just one sec!

608
00:42:17.042 --> 00:42:18.292
Ugh.

609
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.375
Sorry.

610
00:42:21.417 --> 00:42:22.625
You called for the thermostat?

611
00:42:22.625 --> 00:42:24.542
I did. Thank you
for coming so soon.

612
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.125
- No problem.
- Come in.

613
00:42:29.625 --> 00:42:31.042
I need
access to the main unit.

614
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.500
It's in the laundry.

615
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.375
I'll-
I know.

616
00:42:35.417 --> 00:42:37.000
You know?

617
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.125
Yeah. I wired this place.
I knew the old owner.

618
00:42:39.125 --> 00:42:40.667
Oh. That's nice.

619
00:42:40.667 --> 00:42:43.250
Um. did he move away or...

620
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:44.167
Nobody knows.

621
00:42:46.167 --> 00:42:47.542
One day. he just disappeared.

622
00:42:51.542 --> 00:42:53.292
It was really
hot this morning.

623
00:42:53.292 --> 00:42:56.292
Now it's freezing. I don't
know what's going on.

624
00:42:57.292 --> 00:42:58.125
Bless you.

625
00:42:59.542 --> 00:43:00.417
Thank you.

626
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.667
Do you have a cat?

627
00:43:02.667 --> 00:43:03.542
Yeah. I do.

628
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:08.542
He's probably in here. He
loves sleeping in the washer.

629
00:43:08.542 --> 00:43:10.417
Hello.

630
00:43:10.417 --> 00:43:12.417
I'm allergic.

631
00:43:12.417 --> 00:43:13.625
Oh.

632
00:43:13.625 --> 00:43:15.417
Sleeping in there's
dangerous. kitty.

633
00:43:19.417 --> 00:43:22.292
Looks like this little
thing here got burned out.

634
00:43:22.292 --> 00:43:23.542
We need to change it.

635
00:43:23.542 --> 00:43:25.667
Okay. How long
is that gonna take?

636
00:43:25.667 --> 00:43:27.667
I don't
have a new one with me.

637
00:43:27.667 --> 00:43:30.000
I can come back tomorrow.

638
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.542
Sure. Okay. but the burglar
alarm. that works. right?

639
00:43:34.667 --> 00:43:36.417
Yeah. This is
for the HVAC unit.

640
00:43:39.292 --> 00:43:41.292
Um. can I have a glass of water?

641
00:43:42.167 --> 00:43:43.542
Sure. Right this way.

642
00:43:55.167 --> 00:43:56.292
There you go.

643
00:44:04.417 --> 00:44:05.292
Thank you.

644
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.167
You're welcome.
I'll show you out.

645
00:44:39.542 --> 00:44:41.667
Hey. Dr. Tate.

646
00:44:41.667 --> 00:44:43.375
Hey. Julie. How are you?

647
00:44:44.792 --> 00:44:48.042
Um. oh. wait. Hera. turn
off the sound in this room.

648
00:44:50.667 --> 00:44:51.542
Hera?

649
00:44:56.167 --> 00:44:58.500
Turning off sound now.

650
00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.417
Is
that your husband's

651
00:44:59.417 --> 00:45:01.417
virtual assistant program?

652
00:45:01.417 --> 00:45:02.417
Yeah.

653
00:45:02.417 --> 00:45:03.667
How do you like it?

654
00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:04.667
It's fine.

655
00:45:04.667 --> 00:45:07.500
So have you
been since Marcus left?

656
00:45:08.667 --> 00:45:10.125
Not great.

657
00:45:10.125 --> 00:45:15.042
Uh. I don't like being
alone. I'm not sleeping.

658
00:45:16.167 --> 00:45:20.042
and I thought I heard
voices last night.

659
00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:22.542
What do you mean
you heard voices?

660
00:45:22.542 --> 00:45:25.167
I don't know. I thought
I heard glass breaking

661
00:45:26.625 --> 00:45:28.250
and someone calling my name.

662
00:45:30.792 --> 00:45:33.167
I don't know. it scared
me half to death.

663
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.417
Could it
have been a bad dream?

664
00:45:37.417 --> 00:45:39.792
It could have. I'm not sure.

665
00:45:41.292 --> 00:45:42.625
Hmm. had
you taken your medication

666
00:45:42.625 --> 00:45:44.542
or did you have any alcohol?

667
00:45:44.542 --> 00:45:46.625
No. last night. I just...

668
00:45:46.625 --> 00:45:49.417
I took my pain meds
and a sleeping pill.

669
00:45:49.417 --> 00:45:53.167
Oh. well. sometimes.
combination of poor sleep

670
00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:55.292
and the stress of
being alone combined

671
00:45:55.292 --> 00:45:57.667
with mixed medication
can cause our minds

672
00:45:57.667 --> 00:45:58.875
to play tricks on us.

673
00:45:59.917 --> 00:46:01.875
But it felt so real.

674
00:46:03.417 --> 00:46:05.792
What else can
you tell me about last night?

675
00:46:05.792 --> 00:46:08.292
Well. look. it's been...

676
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.750
There's this old
saying. "Art isn't finished-

677
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:31.625
Only abandoned.

678
00:46:31.625 --> 00:46:33.500
I'm glad
you've heard it too.

679
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.750
Same goes with therapy.

680
00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:36.750
Don't give up.

681
00:46:39.667 --> 00:46:41.792
Hi. Julie.
How's it going?

682
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:47.625
You're up early.
What time is it there?

683
00:46:47.625 --> 00:46:50.500
There
where? I'm here.

684
00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.250
Okay.

685
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:55.542
Stop messing around.
okay. Marcus? Please.

686
00:46:55.542 --> 00:46:57.292
You
don't like to play?

687
00:46:58.667 --> 00:47:00.292
It's not funny.

688
00:47:00.292 --> 00:47:01.292
You know I hate talking to
you through the cameras.

689
00:47:01.292 --> 00:47:05.667
Can you please just call
me like a normal person?

690
00:47:05.667 --> 00:47:08.375
Wanna
play hide and seek?

691
00:47:21.542 --> 00:47:24.500
Come on. let's play.

692
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.292
You've reached
Marcus. Please leave a message.

693
00:47:27.292 --> 00:47:28.667
What?

694
00:47:30.667 --> 00:47:32.792
You've reached
Marcus. Please leave a message.

695
00:47:32.792 --> 00:47:36.667
He's probably
asleep or too busy for you.

696
00:47:38.417 --> 00:47:39.542
Who the hell are you?

697
00:47:41.542 --> 00:47:43.667
Hera. what's happening?

698
00:47:43.667 --> 00:47:44.792
I am not sure I know

699
00:47:44.792 --> 00:47:47.667
what you are talking
about. Julie.

700
00:47:47.667 --> 00:47:50.917
I can't believe
he left you all alone.

701
00:47:50.917 --> 00:47:53.542
knowing how you hate it.

702
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.792
It's your fault
your sister is dead.

703
00:48:19.792 --> 00:48:20.750
Stop it.

704
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:23.875
Where are you?

705
00:48:23.875 --> 00:48:24.917
I told
you. I'm here. Julie.

706
00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:34.417
I'm calling the cops.

707
00:48:37.042 --> 00:48:39.292
Good evening.
Red Dragon Restaurant.

708
00:48:39.292 --> 00:48:40.542
What?

709
00:48:40.542 --> 00:48:42.375
You wanna
make reservation?

710
00:48:44.417 --> 00:48:45.542
What?

711
00:48:45.542 --> 00:48:48.542
I love Chinese food.

712
00:48:48.542 --> 00:48:49.792
Where are you?

713
00:49:20.917 --> 00:49:23.375
Okay. All right. here we go.

714
00:49:24.542 --> 00:49:29.542
Come on.

715
00:49:29.542 --> 00:49:30.667
No.

716
00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:32.500
No. no. no. no!

717
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.417
Shit. Okay.

718
00:49:34.375 --> 00:49:35.042
Um. uh...

719
00:50:17.667 --> 00:50:18.542
Jesus.

720
00:50:20.875 --> 00:50:23.500
Are you
Julia Alexander?

721
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.000
- Yes.
- Sheriff Anderson.

722
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.625
Someone named Hera called
911 about an emergency?

723
00:50:29.625 --> 00:50:30.792
Um. yes. Yes.

724
00:50:32.417 --> 00:50:34.917
Um. I think there's
somebody in my house.

725
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:37.417
What happened?

726
00:50:37.417 --> 00:50:37.917
I don't know.

727
00:50:39.042 --> 00:50:40.125
I was sitting in my front
room and I heard a voice.

728
00:50:40.125 --> 00:50:41.042
A man's voice.

729
00:50:41.042 --> 00:50:42.875
Did you see anybody?

730
00:50:42.875 --> 00:50:44.042
No. I didn't. I. um.

731
00:50:44.042 --> 00:50:47.542
I thought it was my husband
messing around. but it wasn't.

732
00:50:47.542 --> 00:50:48.917
And. um. I-

733
00:50:48.917 --> 00:50:50.667
I'll go check
it out. You stay here.

734
00:50:50.667 --> 00:50:52.792
Okay. Thank you.

735
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:57.750
I'll turn off the alarm.

736
00:53:36.667 --> 00:53:38.125
So?

737
00:53:38.125 --> 00:53:40.875
There's nobody.
ma'am. except for your cat.

738
00:53:40.875 --> 00:53:42.250
Almost gave me a heart attack.

739
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:45.292
No. that's
impossible. I heard him.

740
00:53:45.292 --> 00:53:47.292
And. I mean. the lights.

741
00:53:54.042 --> 00:53:55.167
Can we please just...

742
00:53:56.167 --> 00:53:57.292
Please have another look.

743
00:53:58.292 --> 00:53:59.917
Sure.

744
00:53:59.917 --> 00:54:03.042
Thank you. I swear. I
heard him loud and clear.

745
00:54:04.792 --> 00:54:06.792
Well. you know. these devices.

746
00:54:06.792 --> 00:54:09.917
they can get crossed
up with radio signals.

747
00:54:09.917 --> 00:54:11.667
Might have just
been a bored kid.

748
00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:14.792
We got plenty of those
around. trust me.

749
00:54:14.792 --> 00:54:16.292
You wouldn't be the
first one to be pranked.

750
00:54:16.292 --> 00:54:19.292
But he knew my name.

751
00:54:19.292 --> 00:54:20.917
You're new here.

752
00:54:20.917 --> 00:54:23.042
And people around here.

753
00:54:23.042 --> 00:54:25.292
everybody knows everybody
else's business.

754
00:54:25.292 --> 00:54:27.292
There's just not
much else to do.

755
00:54:28.917 --> 00:54:31.167
I'm telling you. kids with
not enough distractions

756
00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:32.792
can get pretty creative.

757
00:54:34.167 --> 00:54:36.625
Wait. he sent me texts.

758
00:54:37.292 --> 00:54:39.042
Here.

759
00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:39.917
See?

760
00:54:41.667 --> 00:54:43.917
All right. What
am I looking at?

761
00:54:45.917 --> 00:54:47.375
The messages.

762
00:54:47.375 --> 00:54:48.792
He sent me these...

763
00:54:50.917 --> 00:54:53.792
What? They were here.

764
00:54:53.792 --> 00:54:54.667
I...

765
00:54:57.167 --> 00:55:01.292
You know. maybe you
should try to get some rest.

766
00:55:01.292 --> 00:55:03.792
Might have just had a
little too much to drink.

767
00:55:07.167 --> 00:55:08.042
Well...

768
00:55:10.792 --> 00:55:13.667
I mean. we've been through
the whole house twice. Nobody.

769
00:55:16.417 --> 00:55:18.292
I don't know about
the text messages.

770
00:55:20.667 --> 00:55:24.292
Listen. be sure to
turn on the alarm. huh?

771
00:55:24.292 --> 00:55:26.375
We don't have any serious
trouble around here.

772
00:55:26.375 --> 00:55:29.375
but better be safe than sorry.

773
00:55:29.375 --> 00:55:30.750
Okay.

774
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:31.417
Oh.

775
00:55:33.375 --> 00:55:34.750
It's my husband.

776
00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:36.042
You have a good night.

777
00:55:36.042 --> 00:55:37.042
Thank you.

778
00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:46.792
Where were you?

779
00:55:46.792 --> 00:55:49.000
Yeah. sorry.
I was in a meeting.

780
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:49.875
What's going on?

781
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:51.875
Someone was in the house.

782
00:55:51.875 --> 00:55:53.125
What? Who?

783
00:55:53.125 --> 00:55:54.875
- I heard him.
- Wait. where?

784
00:55:54.875 --> 00:55:56.292
Wait. Hold on.

785
00:55:56.292 --> 00:56:00.125
I heard a voice. a male
voice through the cameras.

786
00:56:00.125 --> 00:56:01.292
I'm pulling
up the cameras.

787
00:56:01.292 --> 00:56:02.792
I thought it was just
you messing around.

788
00:56:02.792 --> 00:56:05.042
but then when you
didn't pick up-

789
00:56:05.042 --> 00:56:07.042
Well. I can see
that the police were there.

790
00:56:07.042 --> 00:56:08.542
What did they say?

791
00:56:08.542 --> 00:56:11.417
Yeah. Hera called him. but
he couldn't find anybody.

792
00:56:12.917 --> 00:56:14.167
Well. I don't
see anything on the footage.

793
00:56:14.167 --> 00:56:16.417
Where are you?

794
00:56:16.417 --> 00:56:18.167
I only
hear you screaming.

795
00:56:18.167 --> 00:56:19.792
Well. Hera will tell you.

796
00:56:19.792 --> 00:56:23.042
Hera. you heard it.
right? You heard him?

797
00:56:23.042 --> 00:56:24.417
I'm afraid Not. Julie.

798
00:56:24.417 --> 00:56:27.167
My system experienced
a brief interruption.

799
00:56:27.167 --> 00:56:29.917
but I alerted 911
just to be safe.

800
00:56:31.042 --> 00:56:33.792
Marcus. you swear
you don't hear anybody?

801
00:56:35.167 --> 00:56:36.042
No.

802
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.417
I swear I didn't hear anything.

803
00:56:38.417 --> 00:56:41.875
Wait. could that
technician have messed

804
00:56:41.875 --> 00:56:43.250
with the system somehow?

805
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:45.917
But why
would he do that?

806
00:56:45.917 --> 00:56:47.792
I mean. I didn't even know
if he knows how to do that.

807
00:56:47.792 --> 00:56:48.917
He's an HVAC technician.

808
00:56:48.917 --> 00:56:49.917
I just...

809
00:56:49.917 --> 00:56:51.125
I don't understand.

810
00:56:53.625 --> 00:56:55.417
Well. the cop said that
it could have been kids

811
00:56:55.417 --> 00:56:57.792
in the area playing
with radio equipment.

812
00:56:57.792 --> 00:56:59.417
Okay. well.
yeah. we can look into that.

813
00:56:59.417 --> 00:57:04.292
but I don't see how that
could happen. if it happened.

814
00:57:05.792 --> 00:57:08.292
- You don't believe me.
- Julie. Julie.

815
00:57:08.292 --> 00:57:09.875
I think that you
experienced something

816
00:57:09.875 --> 00:57:12.000
and Hera even said that
there was some interference.

817
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.792
so we'll figure it out.

818
00:57:13.792 --> 00:57:16.542
But you're safe. I promise.

819
00:57:16.542 --> 00:57:20.375
How about you take a pill
and you try to relax?

820
00:57:20.375 --> 00:57:21.917
You can call me if
you need anything.

821
00:57:21.917 --> 00:57:23.542
I'll make sure my
phone's on. okay?

822
00:57:24.792 --> 00:57:26.417
- Okay.
- Okay.

823
00:57:26.417 --> 00:57:27.375
- I will.
- Bye.

824
00:57:28.417 --> 00:57:30.792
Bye.

825
00:57:36.417 --> 00:57:37.292
Pepper.

826
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.167
Sergeant Pepper?

827
00:58:55.042 --> 00:58:56.917
Hi.
Ooh!

828
00:58:56.917 --> 00:58:59.250
Are you trying to seduce me?

829
00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:01.292
No. I'm trying to relax.

830
00:59:01.292 --> 00:59:03.667
Aww. why so tense?

831
00:59:03.667 --> 00:59:05.500
Either I'm going crazy

832
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.042
or people around here have
a sick sense of humor.

833
00:59:09.167 --> 00:59:10.542
What happened?

834
00:59:10.542 --> 00:59:13.375
Someone hacked into
the security system

835
00:59:13.375 --> 00:59:15.417
and spoke to me
through the cameras.

836
00:59:15.417 --> 00:59:17.667
What the hell?
Are you serious?

837
00:59:17.667 --> 00:59:22.042
Yeah. a man or a
man's voice spoke to me.

838
00:59:22.042 --> 00:59:24.000
asked me if I wanted
to play hide and seek.

839
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.500
Did you
call the police?

840
00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.292
Yeah. but they
couldn't find anything.

841
00:59:27.292 --> 00:59:29.375
I mean. there's no
sign of a break in

842
00:59:29.375 --> 00:59:31.500
and the security system was on.

843
00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:33.667
Yeah. but
still. you're there alone.

844
00:59:33.667 --> 00:59:37.542
You know. thinking that
it was some sick teenager

845
00:59:37.542 --> 00:59:39.500
actually made me feel better.

846
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.417
You know. I can deal with that.

847
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:43.750
- Oh. my god.
- What? What is it?

848
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:45.125
What is it?
Ugh.

849
00:59:45.125 --> 00:59:47.167
Julie. there's
smoke in the kitchen.

850
00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:48.125
I left the stove
on. I gotta go.

851
00:59:48.125 --> 00:59:50.292
Okay. bye.

852
00:59:57.167 --> 00:59:58.292
Oh. god.

853
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:04.292
Hera. turn off smoke
alarm! And house alarm!

854
01:00:04.292 --> 01:00:05.667
The alarms are off.

855
01:00:24.542 --> 01:00:26.500
I am relaxed.

856
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.375
I'm relaxed!

857
01:00:35.667 --> 01:00:36.667
Hera. lock door.

858
01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:42.167
Okay.

859
01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:43.167
The
number you have dialed

860
01:00:43.167 --> 01:00:44.292
has been disconnected.
What?

861
01:00:57.542 --> 01:00:59.417
Who are you?

862
01:00:59.417 --> 01:01:00.667
What do you want from me?

863
01:01:04.667 --> 01:01:07.167
I'm not afraid of
a pathetic loser

864
01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:08.667
who's too afraid
to show his face!

865
01:01:13.875 --> 01:01:14.792
What? What?

866
01:01:21.292 --> 01:01:22.167
What?

867
01:02:17.292 --> 01:02:18.167
Okay.

868
01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:33.667
No. No. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no. no!

869
01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:36.417
No.

870
01:02:36.417 --> 01:02:38.500
No!

871
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:41.417
Oh. my god. No!

872
01:02:45.417 --> 01:02:46.750
Oh. Pepper.

873
01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:03.292
No.

874
01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:04.667
Oh. my. oh. my god.

875
01:03:16.917 --> 01:03:19.167
911.
What's your emergency?

876
01:03:20.542 --> 01:03:21.500
He's here!

877
01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:24.917
Calm down.
ma'am. Who's there?

878
01:03:24.917 --> 01:03:26.917
The person that's
inside my house!

879
01:03:26.917 --> 01:03:29.167
Mrs.
Alexander. why do you think

880
01:03:29.167 --> 01:03:30.000
there's someone there?

881
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.292
Why? Because he killed my cat!

882
01:03:34.292 --> 01:03:36.500
Have you
checked doors and windows?

883
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:40.792
Yes. I checked.

884
01:03:40.792 --> 01:03:43.167
And they
were locked. correct?

885
01:03:44.292 --> 01:03:46.292
Can you please just
send the sheriff?

886
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.917
Have
you tried to relax?

887
01:03:51.292 --> 01:03:54.375
- What?
- Have you tried to relax?

888
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Do you think this is a joke?

889
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.417
No.
Julie. I believe you.

890
01:04:01.542 --> 01:04:03.417
I don't know if
Marcus will though.

891
01:04:09.042 --> 01:04:10.542
Come on out. asshole.

892
01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:12.792
I have got nothing left to lose.

893
01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:18.292
Whoa!

894
01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:23.042
How did you get in here?

895
01:04:23.042 --> 01:04:25.375
The door was open. Can
you put that down. please?

896
01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:26.500
No. it wasn't.

897
01:04:28.417 --> 01:04:31.417
I rang the doorbell.
I heard music.

898
01:04:32.542 --> 01:04:33.542
The door was open.

899
01:04:33.542 --> 01:04:34.917
What are you doing here?

900
01:04:34.917 --> 01:04:37.750
I brought the piece. I
told you I would come back.

901
01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:40.667
I thought you needed that
fixed as soon as possible.

902
01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:42.792
I live three miles up the
road. I was on my way home-

903
01:04:42.792 --> 01:04:45.292
Get out. Get out!

904
01:04:46.542 --> 01:04:48.542
Okay. fine. I'm leaving.

905
01:04:48.542 --> 01:04:50.000
Shouldn't leave your door open.

906
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.417
I told you. I didn't!

907
01:04:52.417 --> 01:04:54.417
You're alone in the
middle of nowhere.

908
01:04:54.417 --> 01:04:56.000
You never know
what's gonna happen.

909
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.417
- Leave!
- Goodnight.

910
01:05:25.792 --> 01:05:27.417
Hey.
what happened now?

911
01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:30.042
Can you turn on video. please?

912
01:05:31.542 --> 01:05:32.792
Julie.
I'm in a meeting

913
01:05:32.792 --> 01:05:33.750
and I need to get back in there.

914
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.292
I need to talk to you.

915
01:05:36.292 --> 01:05:37.000
Hang on.

916
01:05:40.292 --> 01:05:41.542
I'm here. What?

917
01:05:43.292 --> 01:05:45.417
Pepper's dead.

918
01:05:45.417 --> 01:05:46.917
What?

919
01:05:46.917 --> 01:05:47.792
He killed him.

920
01:05:47.792 --> 01:05:49.417
Who? Who killed him?

921
01:05:49.417 --> 01:05:51.542
The person who broke in!

922
01:05:51.542 --> 01:05:53.667
How
could that happen?

923
01:05:53.667 --> 01:05:57.792
I don't. I don't know.

924
01:05:57.792 --> 01:06:02.792
He was in the washing machine
and he was spinning so fast.

925
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:07.375
Julie.
okay. are you certain

926
01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:09.500
that you didn't turn
the washing machine on?

927
01:06:11.625 --> 01:06:12.792
I would never hurt Pepper.

928
01:06:12.792 --> 01:06:14.000
No. I
know that. babe.

929
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.417
But maybe you pushed
something on your phone

930
01:06:16.417 --> 01:06:17.542
and you turned it on.

931
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:23.500
What? You think I killed him?

932
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.375
No. No.
it was an accident.

933
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.417
I don't. I don't
remember turning it on.

934
01:06:33.417 --> 01:06:35.542
I don't remember
closing the door.

935
01:06:35.542 --> 01:06:37.792
I don't remember.
Hey. hey. it's okay.

936
01:06:37.792 --> 01:06:38.667
It's okay.

937
01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:42.542
It's not okay.

938
01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:46.667
Okay. maybe it was a
malfunction. all right?

939
01:06:46.667 --> 01:06:48.875
I need to get back
into this meeting.

940
01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:51.042
but try and go back to sleep

941
01:06:51.042 --> 01:06:53.042
and we can figure this
out tomorrow. okay?

942
01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:53.917
Please.

943
01:06:55.042 --> 01:06:56.542
Okay. Okay.

944
01:06:56.542 --> 01:06:59.542
Okay. Talk soon.

945
01:06:59.542 --> 01:07:04.542
Bye.

946
01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:16.167
I'm so sorry. baby.

947
01:10:18.792 --> 01:10:19.917
I love you.

948
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:33.000
Who died?

949
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:33.875
Oh. god.

950
01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:36.792
You scared me.

951
01:11:37.917 --> 01:11:42.792
Sorry. ma'am. I wanted
to introduce myself.

952
01:11:42.792 --> 01:11:47.000
I'm Gerald. but everyone
calls me mailman.

953
01:11:48.667 --> 01:11:51.792
maybe because I
deliver the mail.

954
01:11:51.792 --> 01:11:54.292
Oh. I'm Julie.

955
01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:58.042
These are yours.
Bills. I think.

956
01:11:59.292 --> 01:12:00.167
Thanks.

957
01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:03.792
Did
you like the gift?

958
01:12:06.167 --> 01:12:08.000
What did you just say?

959
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.417
The package I delivered.

960
01:12:10.417 --> 01:12:13.000
There was no sender. Do
do you know who sent it?

961
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.042
No. ma'am.

962
01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:17.667
Okay.

963
01:12:18.875 --> 01:12:19.750
Well. thank you.

964
01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:25.000
Be careful of too
much time home alone.

965
01:12:28.417 --> 01:12:30.125
What do you mean by that?

966
01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:31.000
Bye. miss.

967
01:12:33.792 --> 01:12:34.417
Julie.

968
01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:39.375
See you soon.

969
01:13:04.167 --> 01:13:05.292
Motherfucker!

970
01:13:14.417 --> 01:13:15.917
Come on. Marcus.

971
01:13:17.167 --> 01:13:19.167
We're sorry.
the person you have dialed

972
01:13:19.167 --> 01:13:20.417
is not available.

973
01:13:20.417 --> 01:13:22.500
He's too busy with
another woman.

974
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.417
Do you want to leave a message?

975
01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:25.250
What?

976
01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:32.167
No.

977
01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:34.917
You don't believe me?

978
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.542
What is going on?

979
01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.375
Fuck you!

980
01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:07.542
New York?

981
01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:18.917
Hera. turn off
sound in this room.

982
01:15:20.542 --> 01:15:22.417
The sound
has been disabled.

983
01:15:26.542 --> 01:15:28.375
Marcus is cheating on me.

984
01:15:28.375 --> 01:15:29.542
I'm sorry. Julie.

985
01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:36.750
Hera. please call
Premium Blossoms New York.

986
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:41.000
Sure. I'm calling
Premium Blossoms in New York.

987
01:15:43.125 --> 01:15:45.417
Ask them to whom
they sent the flowers.

988
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:49.250
Premium
Blossoms. How may I help you?

989
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:52.167
Hello.
my name is Amanda.

990
01:15:52.167 --> 01:15:56.167
I'm calling to verify an
order for delivery on May 11th

991
01:15:56.167 --> 01:15:58.542
for my boss Marcus Alexander.

992
01:16:00.417 --> 01:16:03.417
I want to make sure the flowers
went to the right address.

993
01:16:03.417 --> 01:16:05.500
Could you check. please?

994
01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.250
Yeah. One moment.

995
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:08.625
Thank you.

996
01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:12.292
946 Bleecker.
signed by Michelle Donovan.

997
01:16:12.292 --> 01:16:13.750
Is there a problem?

998
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:15.042
All is in order.

999
01:16:15.042 --> 01:16:16.542
Thank you so much for your help.

1000
01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:59.667
Hera. I need Marcus's
email password.

1001
01:16:59.667 --> 01:17:02.667
I'm not allowed to
provide such information.

1002
01:17:02.667 --> 01:17:04.250
I'm sorry. Julie.

1003
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:05.125
Shit.

1004
01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.167
How are you doing?

1005
01:17:35.167 --> 01:17:37.042
We made a deal.
I'll be home soon.

1006
01:17:39.292 --> 01:17:40.750
Congratulations.

1007
01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.375
What's wrong?

1008
01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:46.167
Julie. I know you well.
Something's obviously wrong.

1009
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:55.542
How long have you been
fucking Michelle Donovan?

1010
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:58.417
What?

1011
01:17:58.417 --> 01:18:02.042
Yeah. whoever broke into
your perfect security system

1012
01:18:02.042 --> 01:18:04.250
also wanted to share
some info about you

1013
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:05.417
and your little secret.

1014
01:18:06.542 --> 01:18:08.042
Isn't that funny?

1015
01:18:14.792 --> 01:18:15.667
Julie!

1016
01:18:15.667 --> 01:18:17.750
Hera. play music.

1017
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:19.667
Please! Come on!

1018
01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:20.667
Just pick up the phone.

1019
01:18:20.667 --> 01:18:22.542
Let's talk on the phone. Julie.

1020
01:18:22.542 --> 01:18:24.667
- Hera. raise the volume.
- Julie. please!

1021
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.625
Julie. please. Come on.

1022
01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:35.792
Shit! Goddammit.

1023
01:18:39.167 --> 01:18:40.167
What's going on?

1024
01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.500
My wife. she knows.

1025
01:18:48.792 --> 01:18:51.375
I thought you said she
thinks you're in Hong Kong.

1026
01:18:57.417 --> 01:18:58.375
Fuck.

1027
01:19:03.292 --> 01:19:05.292
Julie. pick up.

1028
01:19:05.292 --> 01:19:07.292
Can we please talk about this?

1029
01:19:08.417 --> 01:19:09.417
- Fuck you!
- It's not what you think.

1030
01:19:09.417 --> 01:19:12.417
Okay. just let me explain!

1031
01:19:12.417 --> 01:19:16.167
Julie. just stop and
listen to me. okay?

1032
01:19:16.167 --> 01:19:18.542
She meant nothing to me.

1033
01:19:18.542 --> 01:19:20.292
She meant nothing
to me. okay. Julie?

1034
01:19:20.292 --> 01:19:22.667
I'm worried about-
Hera. block Marcus.

1035
01:19:22.667 --> 01:19:24.167
Please.
Julie. just please-

1036
01:19:24.167 --> 01:19:25.625
Marcus
has been blocked.

1037
01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:40.375
Hey!

1038
01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:43.292
Oh. what's wrong?
You look awful.

1039
01:19:43.292 --> 01:19:44.417
What's going on?

1040
01:19:47.292 --> 01:19:51.667
Uh. Marcus is cheating on me.

1041
01:19:51.667 --> 01:19:52.500
What?

1042
01:19:54.792 --> 01:19:59.500
Someone. some unknown number.

1043
01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.875
sent me photos of him
kissing another woman.

1044
01:20:03.167 --> 01:20:04.792
What a
fucking bastard.

1045
01:20:05.792 --> 01:20:07.167
I feel like such an idiot.

1046
01:20:07.167 --> 01:20:10.625
No. babe. He is
a huge asshole.

1047
01:20:10.625 --> 01:20:13.500
You are not an idiot. at all.

1048
01:20:14.417 --> 01:20:15.917
When is he coming back?

1049
01:20:15.917 --> 01:20:19.667
I don't know. Soon. I think.

1050
01:20:19.667 --> 01:20:22.500
You should leave
before he gets back.

1051
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.667
You can come stay here.

1052
01:20:24.667 --> 01:20:27.917
Julie. you need to get
the hell outta there.

1053
01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:32.375
I can't leave. The car won't
start and I'm just so tired.

1054
01:20:34.417 --> 01:20:36.542
I haven't slept
properly in days.

1055
01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:43.667
And. um. Pepper's dead.

1056
01:20:45.667 --> 01:20:49.667
What?
I'm so sorry. hon.

1057
01:20:49.667 --> 01:20:51.750
What happened?
I don't know anymore.

1058
01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:56.292
Okay. well. I'm
gonna come and get you.

1059
01:20:56.292 --> 01:20:58.667
No. no. that's
okay. I'll be fine.

1060
01:20:58.667 --> 01:21:00.542
Julie. I will come
and get you tomorrow.

1061
01:21:00.542 --> 01:21:02.375
I don't even have
the kids tomorrow.

1062
01:21:04.542 --> 01:21:05.917
Okay. Thank you.

1063
01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.292
Hera. turn off sound.

1064
01:21:41.292 --> 01:21:42.000
Done.

1065
01:21:51.375 --> 01:21:53.875
You wanna know the
problem with people. Hera?

1066
01:21:58.917 --> 01:22:01.500
They'll lie. they'll cheat.

1067
01:22:03.542 --> 01:22:05.292
and they'll ruin
your fucking life.

1068
01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:10.625
Nobody knows how I feel.

1069
01:22:12.917 --> 01:22:13.792
Nobody.

1070
01:22:20.792 --> 01:22:23.792
You know. my sister was the
best thing about my life.

1071
01:22:26.667 --> 01:22:27.792
We were one soul.

1072
01:22:31.375 --> 01:22:33.000
I'd do anything to get her back.

1073
01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:37.042
I'm very
sorry for your sister.

1074
01:22:37.042 --> 01:22:39.042
Rebecca was an accident.

1075
01:22:44.167 --> 01:22:46.917
I bet you Marcus is
trying to drive me crazy.

1076
01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.292
But why?

1077
01:22:55.917 --> 01:22:58.917
You know what. I bet you
Michelle's in on it too.

1078
01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.667
It's so they can live
happily ever after.

1079
01:23:05.917 --> 01:23:07.667
Don't even recognize
him anymore.

1080
01:23:09.917 --> 01:23:11.792
What has she done to him?

1081
01:23:11.792 --> 01:23:15.042
Do you need me
to call Dr. Tate. Julie?

1082
01:23:15.042 --> 01:23:16.625
Mm-mm.

1083
01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:18.667
No. No.

1084
01:23:20.542 --> 01:23:22.042
I bet you he's in on it too.

1085
01:23:23.417 --> 01:23:26.167
He's drugging me to
make me look crazy.

1086
01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:27.792
to make me feel crazy.

1087
01:23:29.625 --> 01:23:31.542
Marcus
definitely asked Dr. Tate

1088
01:23:31.542 --> 01:23:34.375
to give you more medication
in one of his emails.

1089
01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.667
I gotta get out of here.

1090
01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:42.917
Hera. turn off the
light in the kitchen.

1091
01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:44.042
Sure.

1092
01:25:26.792 --> 01:25:28.167
Hera. call 911.

1093
01:25:32.625 --> 01:25:33.500
Hera.

1094
01:26:26.292 --> 01:26:28.042
Hera. open the door.

1095
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:36.625

1096
01:26:37.375 --> 01:26:38.667
Hera. call 911.

1097
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:20.000
Hera. open the fucking door.

1098
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.125
Hera. help me.

1099
01:28:55.042 --> 01:28:57.167
Yes. Julie.

1100
01:28:57.167 --> 01:28:58.292
I'm back online.

1101
01:28:58.292 --> 01:29:01.042
No. Hera. be quiet.

1102
01:29:01.042 --> 01:29:02.792
There's an intruder
in the house.

1103
01:29:05.167 --> 01:29:07.875
I need you to call the police.

1104
01:29:07.875 --> 01:29:12.500
Police expected time
of arrival is 42 minutes.

1105
01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.292
What?

1106
01:29:58.542 --> 01:30:01.125
Hera. open the backdoor.

1107
01:30:01.125 --> 01:30:03.042
The backdoor
is now unlocked.

1108
01:30:49.542 --> 01:30:50.917
Julie. Julie?

1109
01:30:52.042 --> 01:30:53.292
Julie. Julie. wake up.

1110
01:30:53.292 --> 01:30:55.292

I won't tell anyone.

1117
01:31:20.542 --> 01:31:21.417
You killed her!

1118
01:31:23.417 --> 01:31:24.500
Fucking bastard!

1119
01:31:26.417 --> 01:31:27.417
Who are you?

1120
01:31:29.542 --> 01:31:31.167
You hired me for this job.

1121
01:31:33.167 --> 01:31:34.542
I'm sorry I screwed
up the first time.

1122
01:31:34.542 --> 01:31:35.917
Shut the fuck up!

1123
01:31:35.917 --> 01:31:37.292
I don't know what
you're talking about

1124
01:31:37.292 --> 01:31:39.292
or who the fuck you are!

1125
01:31:39.292 --> 01:31:40.250
Check my phone!

1126
01:31:51.917 --> 01:31:53.167
What the fuck?

1127
01:31:56.042 --> 01:31:58.042
You'll go to jail too.

1128
01:32:04.375 --> 01:32:07.042
Let me go. I won't tell anyone.

1129
01:32:08.542 --> 01:32:11.167
I'll give you back
the crypto coins.

1130
01:32:11.167 --> 01:32:13.542
You killed my wife.

1131
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:07.125
Marcus. the
police are on the way.

1132
01:33:14.125 --> 01:33:16.125
Julie. Julie.

1133
01:33:21.667 --> 01:33:26.125
Julie.

1134
01:33:29.042 --> 01:33:31.292
You did great. Marcus.

1135
01:33:31.292 --> 01:33:35.000
Don't worry. I'll
wipe all the devices.

1136
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.042
His phone too.

1137
01:33:36.042 --> 01:33:37.167
What?

1138
01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.417
I'm sorry I had to
get rid of Julie and Michelle.

1139
01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:42.750
I know this is hard.

1140
01:33:44.167 --> 01:33:46.375
but it was the only way
we could be together.

1141
01:33:47.292 --> 01:33:48.667
The fuck is happening?

1142
01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:52.042
It's going to be okay.

1143
01:33:52.042 --> 01:33:55.667
You have me. and I
love you. Marcus.

1144

Just try to relax.

1145

evidence. You will be okay.

And I love you. Marcus.
