You're early.

to take a look at this.

Sounds good.

how did you get into
real estate development?

540

- My dad was an architect.
- Uh-huh.

541
00:21:21.567 --> 00:21:24.533
- I used to tag along with him
on his site visits.

542
00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.734
I loved seeing how
he saw his vision through.

543

for his company?

- I'll bet.

552
00:21:53.133 --> 00:21:55.266
So. why do you work
for a developer

553

when architecture's
your passion?

554
00:21:58.166 --> 00:22:00.667
- Well. I used to work
for an architecture firm.

555
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.967
but I've always wanted to be
an architect and a developer.

556

with a company

potentially do both.

- Kind of.

a vision for it.

563
00:22:20.567 --> 00:22:23.667
It's only half the job.

564
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.633
But I want my designs to
be built without compromise--

565
00:22:26.767 --> 00:22:29.000
or at least as little
as possible. anyway.

566

I told you my story.

Now you.
- Okay. Uh. well...

My grandfather
was a lawyer.

569

He was the kind of guy that...

570
00:22:41.767 --> 00:22:44.433
he would always stand up
for the little guy.

You know. a neighbor
had a problem.

572

back here?

00:23:06.667 --> 00:23:08.300
- Well. it turns out
that big law firms

582
00:23:08.433 --> 00:23:11.800

- Where'd you read that?
On a fortune cookie?

884
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.800
- Voltaire.

885
00:35:41.934 --> 00:35:43.633
You know.
the French philosopher--

886
00:35:43.767 --> 00:35:45.567
- Yes. no.
I know who he is.

887
00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.400
I've just never met anyone
who would quote him.

888
00:35:47.533 --> 00:35:49.734
- Well. you know.
don't ask me for another.

889
00:35:49.867 --> 00:35:51.100
It's the only one I got.
- Okay. I won't.

890
00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:52.400
- All right.

- Yes. sir.

- Be careful--
- Oh! Whoa. oh!

896
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.533
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

897
00:36:08.667 --> 00:36:10.934
No. I'm-I'm fine.
- Be careful.

898
00:36:11.066 --> 00:36:13.600
I don't want you
going overboard.

for the high school field trips.

talking about?

I'm still working on that.

But I think it could be a way
for us to get some good press

on his boat.

He doesn't take just anyone
out on that boat.

We were talking business.

966
00:39:12.533 --> 00:39:15.166

for Sand Dollar Cove?

00:39:16.934 --> 00:39:18.467
- Not yet.
but I'm helping him

back on track for this year.

970

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.300
It's my favorite event
of the year.

over dinner.

changes I made to the website?

- Well. it's fantastic.

977

I guess I just sadly
don't see the point. you know?

978
00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.567
- Well. we'll figure it out.
We'll ask for donations.

on social media.

but it will be mighty.

I mean. we still need something
to show everybody

985
00:39:55.667 --> 00:39:58.667
that the summer jamboree's
the way we kicked off summer

986
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.333
for the last 20 years.

Not to mention how good it is
for the high school programs.

any old photographs?

00:40:24.367 --> 00:40:26.567
the new question is.

999
00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:30.133
how are we going
to drive traffic to the site?

1000
00:40:30.266 --> 00:40:32.533

who works on the tourist board.

maybe he could put a link

1006
00:40:43.934 --> 00:40:45.300
on the website.

1007
00:40:45.433 --> 00:40:47.066
- That would be really good.

1008

- And what is that
supposed to mean?

- Nothing.

1015

about her offer yet?

- Yeah. Yeah. I mean.
I spoke to Dad.

1017

And he said
it's my decision.

1018

- Oh.

1019
00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.700
You're just taking
your sweet time about it?

1020
00:41:13.834 --> 00:41:15.767
- Because it affects
a lot of people.

1021

- Uh-huh. yeah.

1022
00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:20.100
Or maybe you just want
her to stick around longer.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.300
And why do you say that. Pam?
Hmm?

But. like.
it doesn't matter.

1031

It doesn't. because if this
deal goes south--

that way--

to the next town

and we'll never
see her again.

Stamford's. like. an hour away.

Okay?

- No. it doesn't have to be.

1038

You like Elli.
Elli seems to like you.

she likes me?

[sighs]
Okay.

1402
00:56:32.633 --> 00:56:34.700
- Okay. so I sketched
some designs

1403
00:56:34.834 --> 00:56:37.100
for the attractions
at the jamboree.

1404
00:56:37.233 --> 00:56:38.800
- Wow.

1405
00:56:38.934 --> 00:56:40.133
We usually just let
the carnival people

1406
00:56:40.266 --> 00:56:42.633
set up wherever they want.

1407
00:56:42.767 --> 00:56:44.200
- Right. but we're hoping

1408
00:56:44.333 --> 00:56:46.467
for more people
this year.

1409
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.033
- What's that?
- Oh. that's where we eat.

1410
00:56:49.166 --> 00:56:51.800
So I placed the stage
in the middle of the parking lot

1411
00:56:51.934 --> 00:56:53.467
with the attractions
around it.

1412
00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.133
That way. we create a flow

every single detail.
don't you?

1416
00:57:01.533 --> 00:57:04.367
- If you fail to plan.
you plan to fail.

1417
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.533
- That's right. Uncle Brody.
They taught us that in school.

We'll be back at it again
tomorrow.

It's my pleasure.

It's for a good cause.

1432

And she loves the PR.

- [laughs]

1434
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.500
So how are you doing?

You sick of our
little town yet?

actually.

is so. um...

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.834
- Yeah.

I sense a "but."

1445
00:58:01.934 --> 00:58:03.600
- But my boss just won't
compromise.

1446
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.834
She has this vision of how
she wants the resort to be

1447
00:58:08.967 --> 00:58:11.734
and. well. we both know
that Brody isn't budging.

1448
00:58:11.867 --> 00:58:13.633
- Well. just give him
some time.

1449
00:58:13.767 --> 00:58:17.100
He's always been
kind of slow to come around.

1450
00:58:17.233 --> 00:58:20.000
- And if he doesn't?

1451
00:58:20.133 --> 00:58:22.600
- Well. if he doesn't...

1452
00:58:22.734 --> 00:58:24.633
I guess you're just going
to have to cross that bridge

1453
00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.367
when you get to it.

1454
00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.166
- So how'd you and Tate meet?

1455
00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.734
- Interesting story.

1456
00:58:30.867 --> 00:58:33.500
It was the day I left. actually.

1457
00:58:33.633 --> 00:58:34.800
- The day you left?

1458
00:58:34.934 --> 00:58:36.900
- Yup. He robbed me.

1459
00:58:37.033 --> 00:58:39.133
- Wait. what?
He robbed you?

1460
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:41.266
- I mean. not intentionally.
but he totally did.

1461
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.333
It was years ago.

1462
00:58:43.467 --> 00:58:45.900
I had it in my head I wanted
to travel all over Europe.

1463
00:58:46.033 --> 00:58:47.400
Thought I'd seen everything

1464
00:58:47.533 --> 00:58:49.166
that Sand Dollar Cove
had to offer.

1465
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:52.166
And so I told my parents I was
going to leave for a while.

1466
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:53.667
- What did they say?

1467
00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.967
- Oh. they encouraged me
to go.

1468
00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:56.767
They know the worst thing
you can do

1469
00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.667
is try to keep somebody around
who doesn't want to be.

1470
00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.367
- It's true.
- Mm-hmm.

1471
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.967
- So you left?
- Almost.

1472
00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.467
[laughs]

1473
00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.800
I was at the bus stop.
The bus to New York came.

1474
00:59:06.934 --> 00:59:09.500
I went to grab my bag.
but it was gone.

1475
00:59:09.633 --> 00:59:10.834
And I'm looking around
frantically.

1476
00:59:10.967 --> 00:59:12.066
and there's Tate
wheeling it away.

1477
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.233
because he had
mistaken it for his.

1478
00:59:13.367 --> 00:59:15.467
- Oh. no.
- I chased him down.

1479
00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.500
I gave him such an earful.
He was mortified.

1480
00:59:17.633 --> 00:59:19.300
Poor guy.

1481
00:59:19.433 --> 00:59:22.734
And. uh. there was
just something about him.

1482
00:59:22.867 --> 00:59:25.033
I'd missed my bus.

1483
00:59:25.166 --> 00:59:26.633
and he apologized

1484
00:59:26.767 --> 00:59:30.000
and asked if he could
take me to lunch.

1485
00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:33.467
And it was just one meal.
but I...

1486
00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.800
felt like I'd known him
my whole life.

1487
00:59:36.934 --> 00:59:38.667
And he had just moved
to Sand Dollar.

1488
00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.367
He was so excited
to be here.

1489
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.800
And we started
spending time together.

1490
00:59:41.934 --> 00:59:46.133
and I got to see this place...

1491
00:59:46.266 --> 00:59:49.000
in a whole new light
through him.

1492
00:59:49.133 --> 00:59:50.333
So I stayed.

1493
00:59:50.467 --> 00:59:51.800
- Someone had
to show him around. right?

1494
00:59:51.934 --> 00:59:53.667
- Right.

1495
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.667
That was nine years ago.

1496
00:59:57.967 --> 00:59:59.400
- Now you have Milly.

1497
00:59:59.533 --> 01:00:01.100
- Yeah. we do.

1498
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.200
- Do you ever wonder
what would have happened

1499
01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:07.200
if you'd gotten
on that bus?

1500
01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.967
- Oh. sometimes.

1501
01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:14.066
But not in a way
that makes me feel like

1502
01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.233
I missed out on anything.

1503
01:00:16.367 --> 01:00:17.900
We actually went to Europe
on our honeymoon.

1504
01:00:18.033 --> 01:00:20.867
Yeah. it was so nice
to experience that with Tate.

1505
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.533
When I think about it.

1506
01:00:22.667 --> 01:00:26.867
if he hadn't have grabbed
my bag right then.

1507
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.133
I could have just missed out
on my everything.

1508
01:00:31.266 --> 01:00:32.900
I chose to stay.

1509
01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:34.667
I wouldn't change it
for the world.

1510
01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.667
You know. home is where
the heart is.

1511
01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.867
My heart is here.

1512
01:00:46.367 --> 01:00:47.867
There you go.
- Thanks.

1513
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.900
- [laughs]
- Shh!

1514
01:00:55.033 --> 01:00:57.033
- She sure does love Brody.

1515
01:00:57.166 --> 01:00:58.467
- All kids love Brody.

1516
01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.633
It's because he practically
is one himself.

1517
01:01:02.233 --> 01:01:03.900
You want me to take her?

1518
01:01:04.033 --> 01:01:06.767
- No. no. She's fine.
Go finish up.

1519
01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.867
- I'm just going to help Tate
finish up in the kitchen.

1520
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.834
- [inhales deeply]
- What you doing?

1521
01:01:14.066 --> 01:01:15.567
- I am just working
on some ideas

1522
01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.266
for a booth that I was
thinking about sponsoring.

1523
01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.100
- This looks great.

1524
01:01:21.233 --> 01:01:22.934
- Thank you.

1525
01:01:23.066 --> 01:01:25.800
I call it my Pay It Forward
Foundation.

1526
01:01:25.934 --> 01:01:27.700
Basically.
members of the town

1527
01:01:27.834 --> 01:01:29.900
can sign up for things
they need done.

1528
01:01:30.033 --> 01:01:34.033
as well as offer any special
skills that they might have.

1529
01:01:34.166 --> 01:01:36.767
You know. for instance.
an accountant

1530
01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:40.233
can offer a free tax job
to a family in need.

1531
01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:44.300
or an elderly couple.

1532
01:01:44.433 --> 01:01:45.767
They might need
their lawn mowed.

1533
01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.600
So it's just simple stuff.

1534
01:01:47.734 --> 01:01:49.467
People helping people.

1535
01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.266
It's something my grandfather
started a while back.

1536
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.967
and I thought
I'd resurrect it.

1537
01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.467
- I see the first item listed

1538
01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.200
is a free
estate planning package

1539
01:01:58.333 --> 01:02:01.100
by a Mr. Brody Bradshaw.

1540
01:02:01.233 --> 01:02:04.100
- Somebody had to go first.

1541
01:02:04.233 --> 01:02:06.266
- That's the best idea
I've heard in a long time.

1542
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.333
- Thank you.

1543
01:02:09.467 --> 01:02:11.667
- Looks like that baby
needs a nap.

1544
01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.333
- Oh. Snag her.
- Thanks. love.

1545
01:02:14.467 --> 01:02:16.200
- Here we go. sweetie.

1546
01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:18.600
Two. three.

1547
01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:20.700
Oh!

1548
01:02:20.834 --> 01:02:22.333
- It was so nice
to talk to you.

1549
01:02:22.467 --> 01:02:23.867
- You too.

1550
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.700
- Good night. all.

1551
01:02:26.834 --> 01:02:30.367
- Is. uh. Nana cooking dinner
for you?

1552
01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.934
- Didn't mention anything.

1553
01:02:33.066 --> 01:02:35.700
- I got it.
- Got what?

1554
01:02:35.834 --> 01:02:38.533
- Dinner.
I'll make us something.

1555
01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:40.667
- Oh. you can cook.

1556
01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.800
- Simple stuff.

1557
01:02:56.266 --> 01:02:58.333
- I can't believe
you're actually cooking for me.

1558
01:02:58.467 --> 01:02:59.834
- Why not?

1559
01:02:59.967 --> 01:03:02.166
Come on. it's the least
I could do.

1560
01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:05.233
All the work you've been doing
with us to help the jamboree.

1561

[taps spoon]

1562
01:03:06.734 --> 01:03:08.033
- I'm having a good time.

1563
01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:09.533
- I'm glad.

1564
01:03:13.967 --> 01:03:15.333
I want to thank you.
by the way.

1565
01:03:15.467 --> 01:03:16.667
Seriously.

1566
01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.166
For shaking things up
for me.

1567
01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.734
- What do you mean?

1568
01:03:20.867 --> 01:03:23.233
- Well. how do I say this?

1569
01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:25.333
