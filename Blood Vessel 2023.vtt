00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:06.791
God. come and help me God!

4
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.666
God. come and help my son.

5
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.833
We won't accept this.
we won't accept this!

6
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:18.375
We won't accept this.
we won't accept this!

7
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:06.583
My boy. remember what we discussed.

8
00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:12.125
-Definitely.
-Do you hear me?

9
00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:49.291
Come and eat this.

10
00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:50.958
Why should I?

11
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.708
All I want is my freedom.

12
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:55.083
I don't want to eat!

13
00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:02.791
Then. I'll give you your freedom.

14
00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:04.333
I can't do that.

15
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.500
I don't intend to keep that promise.

16
00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:13.958
Where did you learn this?

17
00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:16.500
Don't you know I'm trying to save you?

18
00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:21.791
I can't leave him.

19
00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.833
I'll tell you why.
his child is inside my womb.

20
00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:31.875
Girl. What have you done?

21
00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:34.833
All I want is love.

22
00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:37.541
The truth is that it's not a crime.

23
00:04:46.666 --> 00:04:49.250
It is not a curse.
The child is not a curse.

24
00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:55.500
Very soon.

25
00:04:56.708 --> 00:04:58.375
you will become a grandfather.

26
00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:05.958
I disagree!

27
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.250
You won't have it! You won't!

28
00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:12.083
You will not have the child.

29
00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:15.791
Very early tomorrow.
I will send you to Warri.

30
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.666
who will abort
this abomination in your womb.

31
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.916
Please. my father.

32
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.291
-You are mad.
-Please. Father.

33
00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:33.500
Please. Father.

34
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.083
Please!

35
00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:43.666
You will never. ever… You will never

36
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.958
-come back to this town.
-Please. Father.

37
00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:49.333
-Seriously.
-My father.

38
00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:51.750
-My father!
-Leave me!

39
00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:57.083
My father!

40
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.458
My father!

41
00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:12.458
-Son…
-Yes. Father.

42
00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:13.791
Don't let her out.

43
00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:16.083
Do you understand?!

44
00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:47.833
My brother… this journey.

45
00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:49.708
do you really want to to embark on it?

46
00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:52.291
Yes I want to embark on it.

47
00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:58.458
On this journey. things might go bad!

48
00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:04.666
The ocean will be rough!

49
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.250
I have decided! I will go.

50
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.333
Taking care of this family
is my responsibility.

51
00:07:14.416 --> 00:07:15.625
that is why I'm asking you.

52
00:08:00.708 --> 00:08:03.416
Nembe people have started again.

53
00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.083
Mother… why do you worry so much?

54
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:12.666
Isn't it my job to worry?

55
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.208
Calm down. All will be fine.

56
00:08:22.708 --> 00:08:25.833
Olotu… do as you have promised!

57
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.750
When we get to the white man's land.

58
00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:32.875
I will call you.

59
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:51.083
come and hug me.

60
00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:11.458
Okay? You must follow his footsteps.

61
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.625
Do you hear what I'm saying?

62
00:09:14.916 --> 00:09:15.875
I've heard you.

63
00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:52.041
Mama Dolor. that roasted plantain
you gave me yesterday was not nice.

64
00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:53.041
I didn't enjoy it.

65
00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:55.083
Even the money you paid wasn't enough.

66
00:09:56.083 --> 00:09:58.291
Now that you've come to buy again.

67
00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:00.125
I'll treat you well.
I will give you good ones.

68
00:10:00.791 --> 00:10:02.791
Because of these protests going on.

69
00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:04.791
that's why things are like this.

70
00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:07.958
-Don't be angry.
-No worries.

71
00:10:10.916 --> 00:10:12.375
A block is a block!

72
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.250
Okay.

73
00:11:32.583 --> 00:11:33.791
Where is your father?

74
00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:56.833
What is the matter?

75
00:11:59.333 --> 00:12:00.875
My father held me hostage.

76
00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.541
and he is planning to send me to Warri.

77
00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:10.125
Abbey. come out! Come out! I'm shocked.

78
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:13.125
-Abbey. come out.
-What happened?

79
00:12:13.708 --> 00:12:15.375
Get away from there.
where is your eldest son?

80
00:12:16.083 --> 00:12:18.625
He wants to abort the baby in my womb.

81
00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:24.416
Abbey please. I don't want to abort it!

82
00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:31.708
Abbey. please!

83
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.250
Abbey. please!

84
00:12:41.375 --> 00:12:42.250
I'm coming.

85
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.833
-Open this gate.
-Abbey is not around.

86
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.708
-Girl. get out of here!
-You are insane.

87
00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:17.541
-Be careful.
-Yes. Abbey.

88
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.500
Come let us go.

89
00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:34.750
-Yes. let's go…
-I agree.

90
00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:35.833
Be fast.

91
00:15:01.416 --> 00:15:03.583
-Yes. of course.
-Man…

92
00:15:03.666 --> 00:15:05.000
This thing happening is disturbing
and it's is affecting us.

93
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.291
-Abbey.
-Enter inside.

94
00:17:51.083 --> 00:17:54.000
Move! Move!

95
00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:57.375
Get out of there! Move!

96
00:18:18.875 --> 00:18:21.833
Stop panicking. it will be alright.

97
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:19.791
Get away from there!

98
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.791
But these boys you are talking about…

99
00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:45.375
They are just thugs being used.

100
00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:50.375
If you want to end the uprising today.

101
00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:13.916
-Open this door!
-Where is your son?!

102
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
What did we do?

103
00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:16.833
-Good!
-What have we done?

104
00:20:17.458 --> 00:20:18.750
What have we done?

105
00:20:20.291 --> 00:20:21.250
Open this door.

106
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:23.291
Where is Abbey?

107
00:20:23.875 --> 00:20:26.375
-Where did he go?
-My brother.

108
00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:28.833
-Where is he?
-What did he do?

109
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:37.250
-Clear! Madam…
-He has a gun.

110
00:20:41.916 --> 00:20:43.583
It's not over.

111
00:20:45.125 --> 00:20:47.250
-Ebiye.
-It's not over!

112
00:21:04.416 --> 00:21:07.750
-Abbey…
-Why do they want to arrest us?

113
00:21:10.041 --> 00:21:11.875
Some youth killed a soldier.

114
00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:18.916
You are crazy. Don't you have sense?

115
00:21:19.833 --> 00:21:21.708
We are fighting for general welfare

116
00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:24.291
and you're there misbehaving.
Get out of my sight!

117
00:21:28.416 --> 00:21:29.916
-Are you… are you insane?
-Why are you misbehaving?!

118
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.500
-Listen. listen! Be silent.
-My friend. I will hit you.

119
00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:33.500
-Do you understand?
-Keep moving.

120
00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:34.583
-I will beat you more!
-Keep quiet

121
00:21:34.666 --> 00:21:36.041
-Please. calm down.
-Just calm down.

122
00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:37.666
Degbe. calm down!

123
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.791
My friend. behave yourself.

124
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.333
We are helping you people
and you're misbehaving.

125
00:21:42.916 --> 00:21:44.458
Now you do not appreciate us.

126
00:21:45.666 --> 00:21:48.625
This Axis Oil company
came to the community.

127
00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:50.291
messed up the environment.

128
00:21:50.791 --> 00:21:53.541
polluted the land. poisoned our waters…

129
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.041
And you expect us
not to attack these evil men?

130
00:21:57.708 --> 00:21:59.291
And you are not supporting us.

131
00:21:59.375 --> 00:22:00.416
No problem!

132
00:22:04.708 --> 00:22:06.083
Taking a stand all this time.

133
00:22:06.708 --> 00:22:07.708
what have we gained?

134
00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:09.875
Guy.

135
00:22:11.416 --> 00:22:13.833
let me enlighten you. Do you understand?

136
00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:16.708
If anybody should die.

137
00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:20.125
-those on earth will carry on.
-Of course.

138
00:22:20.666 --> 00:22:22.333
-Let's keep moving.
-I know what I stand for.

139
00:22:22.416 --> 00:22:23.625
What do you stand for?

140
00:22:26.041 --> 00:22:27.625
Let's go. let's go. I'm upset.

141
00:22:32.208 --> 00:22:33.083
You over there!

142
00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:34.708
You two. I've never seen you
in this community before.

143
00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:35.625
Who are you?

144
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.708
We're not from around here.

145
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:40.166
-Tekena!
-We're coming from Imiringi.

146
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.541
So what brings you to Nembe?

147
00:22:43.166 --> 00:22:44.458
My brother. we're just passing by.

148
00:22:44.541 --> 00:22:45.666
We don't want to be part of your struggle.

149
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.666
Why not?

150
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.708
Guy. don't waste time
discussing with these jokers.

151
00:22:48.791 --> 00:22:50.291
These guys are weak.

152
00:22:50.375 --> 00:22:52.666
In case you're not aware.
this is the only land that we have.

153
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:57.166
Idiot. Your father! Bastard!

154
00:22:57.666 --> 00:22:58.916
Your father's ass!

155
00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:38.041
How's it going? Have you seen my brother?

156
00:23:42.458 --> 00:23:43.833
Something has affected him.

157
00:23:43.916 --> 00:23:44.916
What's that on you?

158
00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:53.250
Are you going to kill it?

159
00:23:53.791 --> 00:23:55.541
-Kill it! Kill it!
-Wait. stop. stop!

160
00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.541
That is Adumu.

161
00:24:01.416 --> 00:24:03.916
It won't bite you unless
it perceives you want to attack it.

162
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.458
My grandma tells me that Adumu…

163
00:24:07.083 --> 00:24:09.250
Adumu is a water spirit.

164
00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:11.666
She says it's a water spirit
but poses as a python.

165
00:24:13.166 --> 00:24:14.500
She told me that we come from water

166
00:24:14.583 --> 00:24:16.541
and we will return to water when we die.

167
00:24:16.625 --> 00:24:17.791
-Man!
-Abbey.

168
00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:19.666
-Where did you go?
-Brave man!

169
00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:21.458
This is a good food.

170
00:24:21.541 --> 00:24:23.416
-Lady. leave here.
-You want to eat it?

171
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.041
-Let's do it!
-Delicious meal.

172
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.375
-Brave man.
-Yeah.

173
00:24:31.083 --> 00:24:33.250
My man… turn that one over.

174
00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.958
Look at this one here.

175
00:25:00.375 --> 00:25:01.791
The military men are still there.

176
00:25:02.291 --> 00:25:04.625
What is really happening?
What are we going to do?

177
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.291
Take this to Abbey
and give him a message for me.

178
00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:16.000
There is a trap set for him.

179
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:18.375
If Abbey doesn't leave. he'd fall in it.

180
00:25:19.375 --> 00:25:20.500
Give him this money.

181
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.791
Tell him to leave this town.

182
00:25:25.208 --> 00:25:26.208
Go to the boatyard.

183
00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:27.541
-pass through the back.
-I'll take the things to them.

184
00:25:33.875 --> 00:25:35.375
I brought money and the bag.

185
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.541
Abbey. please.

186
00:25:38.208 --> 00:25:40.166
Don't come back home
or soldiers will arrest you.

187
00:25:41.833 --> 00:25:43.458
When it is quiet. we move.

188
00:25:45.541 --> 00:25:46.708
Let me call him.

189
00:25:49.916 --> 00:25:52.916
Brother. what about the others?

190
00:25:55.125 --> 00:25:56.416
What do we care about them?

191
00:25:59.791 --> 00:26:01.541
As we planned. let me call Mr. P.

192
00:26:09.583 --> 00:26:10.500
My phone.

193
00:26:13.125 --> 00:26:14.375
I can't find it.

194
00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:23.666
What are we going to do?

195
00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:26.083
I had it but it's lost.

196
00:26:29.583 --> 00:26:30.666
Be strong.

197
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.958
What was the message
your sister brought to you?

198
00:26:42.958 --> 00:26:46.416
Your father reported me to the police that

199
00:26:47.625 --> 00:26:48.541
I'm the head of the three people

200
00:26:49.208 --> 00:26:52.875
who started the protest.
Now the police is looking for me.

201
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.125
I can't go back home again.

202
00:27:16.541 --> 00:27:18.166
The soldiers are searching
everywhere for us.

203
00:27:22.083 --> 00:27:23.833
How are you involved in this?

204
00:27:24.666 --> 00:27:25.791
That is not important.

205
00:27:26.541 --> 00:27:29.500
Just know that.
all of us are in the same boat.

206
00:27:45.791 --> 00:27:47.416
we have to keep a low profile for now.

207
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.333
We have to go either Lagos or Ghana…

208
00:27:52.416 --> 00:27:54.416
How will we find our way to Ghana now?

209
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.791
How will we do it?

210
00:27:55.875 --> 00:27:57.083
You killed a soldier!

211
00:28:03.041 --> 00:28:04.958
Or have you forgotten
what happened at Odi massacre?

212
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.583
Please…

213
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.041
does anyone know a Mr. Perekemi?

214
00:28:14.625 --> 00:28:16.375
He's from this village.

215
00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:20.500
-Who would know him?
-I don't know him.

216
00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:28.625
Is he a sailor?

217
00:28:33.416 --> 00:28:34.666
-Mr. P?
-Yes.

218
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:35.750
Mr. P. yes.

219
00:28:36.333 --> 00:28:37.791
I know Mr. P.

220
00:28:37.875 --> 00:28:39.125
What do you want him for?

221
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.916
I know him.

222
00:28:47.083 --> 00:28:50.166
Man. you better tell me
why you're looking for Mr. P.

223
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.833
So that I can tell you
how to find him. you understand?

224
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.666
Mr. P promised…

225
00:29:06.583 --> 00:29:08.416
to leave this village and go abroad.

226
00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:17.500
Man. can you give us more details?

227
00:29:20.208 --> 00:29:23.083
Tell me. can you give us more details?

228
00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:28.000
Do you have any money?

229
00:29:31.125 --> 00:29:33.958
I… I have a little money here.
for my girlfriend and I.

230
00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:38.000
For you and your girlfriend. right?

231
00:29:38.083 --> 00:29:39.541
So the rest of us should be killed?

232
00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:45.333
Selfish bastard!
That's why you're a half-breed.

233
00:29:45.833 --> 00:29:47.583
Boma. make a call.

234
00:29:47.666 --> 00:29:50.083
Call your house
to pack some things so we can leave.

235
00:29:50.958 --> 00:29:52.041
You hear?

236
00:29:54.583 --> 00:29:55.500
Hope you understand.

237
00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:02.500
I have checked them out.

238
00:30:02.583 --> 00:30:03.416
You know I don't like to work

239
00:30:07.291 --> 00:30:08.625
This is the money. right?

240
00:30:09.625 --> 00:30:11.416
My friend. are you're sure
the money is complete?

241
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.291
-Everything is complete. Mr. P.
-You all follow me.

242
00:30:24.583 --> 00:30:25.708
You all keep coming.

243
00:30:27.541 --> 00:30:29.083
Walk carefully.

244
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.750
Move gently.

245
00:30:41.916 --> 00:30:44.833
Move quietly so that
people above don't hear you.

246
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.541
You all should hurry down.

247
00:30:53.625 --> 00:30:56.375
Come on. walk quickly. take giant strides.

248
00:31:01.958 --> 00:31:04.833
Jesus. enter! Stop asking me
very stupid… go on. enter!

249
00:31:05.458 --> 00:31:06.875
Go inside. come on!

250
00:31:08.458 --> 00:31:10.208
You're acting timid.

251
00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:12.541
Mr. P. please tell us
what type of place is this.

252
00:31:12.625 --> 00:31:14.000
This is not what we paid for.

253
00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:18.500
Hurry up! Catch your brother's bag.

254
00:31:18.583 --> 00:31:20.000
What kind of people are these?!

255
00:31:20.083 --> 00:31:22.916
Catch your bottle. Take. take!

256
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.666
Go on inside! You're just looking around.

257
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.791
Aren't you a man?

258
00:31:29.041 --> 00:31:31.791
Look here… this is a five star lodge.

259
00:31:32.708 --> 00:31:34.458
Mr. P. are you sure there's no other place

260
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:36.041
where we can stay?

261
00:31:36.125 --> 00:31:37.625
Is something wrong with you?

262
00:31:40.583 --> 00:31:43.916
This is… either you take
this space or you leave my boat.

263
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
-Mr. P.
-Yes?

264
00:31:46.958 --> 00:31:48.916
-There is no toilet in here.
-Yes. there is no toilet.

265
00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:51.708
That bucket by the side is your toilet.

266
00:31:51.791 --> 00:31:53.166
Make good use of it.

267
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:54.333
Come on. Mr. P.

268
00:31:54.416 --> 00:31:55.666
-Mr. P.
-What is it?

269
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.125
-Okay. Mr. P…
-Okay. as for food.

270
00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:00.083
Look. let me tell you this…

271
00:32:00.583 --> 00:32:04.208
I made provision for only one mouth.

272
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.250
I will… I will feed you all as well.

273
00:32:08.333 --> 00:32:10.083
But it is only one meal a day.

274
00:32:10.166 --> 00:32:13.750
So please choose whether it's…
a day or night-time meal.

275
00:32:15.708 --> 00:32:16.958
Mr. P. we'll eat at night.

276
00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:26.000
You all must never
come upstairs out of this place.

277
00:32:27.875 --> 00:32:28.875
Do you all understand?

278
00:32:28.958 --> 00:32:30.166
-Yeah. yeah.
-We will manage this place.

279
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.541
Because I won't be lenient with anybody.

280
00:32:34.625 --> 00:32:36.958
I make money from this. Thank you.

281
00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:23.958
Everybody. come here. come here!

282
00:34:00.041 --> 00:34:02.125
-My brother.
-My friend.

283
00:34:02.208 --> 00:34:03.500
We've started sailing.

284
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.458
Awesome.

285
00:34:07.375 --> 00:34:08.250
Awesome.

286
00:34:11.333 --> 00:34:13.291
Since we began our journey till now.

287
00:34:13.375 --> 00:34:15.625
if we were bad people
we would have been arrested.

288
00:34:16.875 --> 00:34:18.208
We are not bad people.

289
00:34:19.208 --> 00:34:20.541
God has made it possible.

290
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:23.625
It is the creator
that brought us this far.

291
00:35:06.083 --> 00:35:06.916
Let's join what's left
of our food together.

292
00:35:08.583 --> 00:35:09.833
It will sustain us
because the journey is far.

293
00:35:11.833 --> 00:35:15.166
Who made you the leader over us?

294
00:35:15.833 --> 00:35:17.166
I'm the leader.

295
00:35:18.833 --> 00:35:20.458
Brother. I'm not the leader.

296
00:35:21.291 --> 00:35:23.791
I just want to be alive. that's all.

297
00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:28.958
I will rather starve to death
than eat with a half-breed!

298
00:35:31.875 --> 00:35:34.333
-Calm down. Are you kidding me?!
-What's all this?

299
00:35:34.416 --> 00:35:35.583
Men…

300
00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:36.791
Shh.

301
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:40.375
There will be no fight on this trip.

302
00:35:40.458 --> 00:35:42.458
I'm not taking sides.

303
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:44.750
If you people refuse to stop…

304
00:35:44.833 --> 00:35:46.250
When we get to the white man's land…

305
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:52.583
if you insist on fighting.
you can continue.

306
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
I hope you heard me.

307
00:35:59.083 --> 00:36:01.208
-Do you hear me?
-I've heard you.

308
00:36:03.125 --> 00:36:04.166
Do you hear me?

309
00:36:24.041 --> 00:36:25.500
Man. what's that smell?

310
00:36:29.833 --> 00:36:31.083
It's that soil bucket.

311
00:36:36.375 --> 00:36:38.125
This boat is not moving!

312
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.291
Please come on board the ship.

313
00:38:19.583 --> 00:38:20.625
Friends.

314
00:38:21.875 --> 00:38:23.291
From what I hear.

315
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.750
Brazil is where

316
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.458
the most beautiful girls in the world are.

317
00:38:35.541 --> 00:38:37.333
Put on this bracelet

318
00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.458
so the beautiful girls in Brazil…

319
00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:44.041
will know you are mine.

320
00:38:50.666 --> 00:38:51.750
I promise.

321
00:38:53.166 --> 00:38:56.041
Degbe! What is the matter?

322
00:38:57.375 --> 00:38:59.041
Man. calm down.

323
00:38:59.541 --> 00:39:01.250
What's going on?

324
00:39:01.791 --> 00:39:02.875
What's going on?

325
00:39:03.458 --> 00:39:06.000
If not for what he said.
I would have gone out.

326
00:39:06.791 --> 00:39:07.958
What exactly is going on?!

327
00:39:11.166 --> 00:39:13.541
So how do you want us to work this?

328
00:39:13.625 --> 00:39:14.833
What do you want us to do?

329
00:39:14.916 --> 00:39:17.333
My man. I think we should leave.

330
00:39:17.416 --> 00:39:19.333
Let's find out what's going on.

331
00:39:21.416 --> 00:39:23.208
Mr. P said we shouldn't leave this place.

332
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:25.208
The same Mr. P
who left us here to die. right?

333
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:27.666
Man. don't give me that.

334
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:30.291
-Don't give me that.
-Those are the instructions he gave.

335
00:39:33.833 --> 00:39:35.291
If this ship doesn't sail now.

336
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.208
we will run out of food.

337
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.708
Even this half-breed here agrees with me.

338
00:39:45.875 --> 00:39:47.375
So the issue here now is.

339
00:39:47.458 --> 00:39:50.291
who will go out
and who will remain inside here?

340
00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:52.708
Let's vote.

341
00:40:21.791 --> 00:40:24.041
No. My brother can't go out there.

342
00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:25.416
What's this guy saying?

343
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.458
-We've already discussed this.
-Wait. wait. I'll--

344
00:40:27.541 --> 00:40:29.375
I'm not a child that you can stop.

345
00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:51.083
-Teke. what are you doing?
-Don't stop me!

346
00:40:51.166 --> 00:40:52.208
You are my elder brother. not my father.

347
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:55.166
You really want to go out?

348
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.166
Yes but I'll come back.

349
00:41:01.291 --> 00:41:03.625
Tekena! I beg you to listen.

350
00:41:23.125 --> 00:41:23.958
The boat.

351
00:41:26.041 --> 00:41:27.916
It seems like
the ship has started sailing.

352
00:41:53.666 --> 00:41:55.958
It snows and rains.
and whoever's not in Africa is…

353
00:41:56.041 --> 00:41:58.083
-a dumbass!
-A dumbass!

354
00:42:00.416 --> 00:42:02.250
Talking about dumbasses…

355
00:42:02.333 --> 00:42:03.958
Today the commander
talked to me about pride.

356
00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:06.375
I told him to shove it

357
00:42:06.458 --> 00:42:08.458
-up his ass!
-Right up his ass!

358
00:42:10.666 --> 00:42:11.625
Oyin. what's up?

359
00:42:13.083 --> 00:42:14.333
Tell us your stories.

360
00:42:17.458 --> 00:42:20.000
This girl wants to tell us
another depressing story.

361
00:42:25.666 --> 00:42:28.541
My grandmother told me
of our people that has been forgotten…

362
00:42:29.625 --> 00:42:30.875
But it is our story.

363
00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:34.541
She said that a long time ago

364
00:42:35.083 --> 00:42:37.166
those white men used to take our people

365
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.916
to their land and sell them.

366
00:42:45.875 --> 00:42:47.083
She said…

367
00:42:51.791 --> 00:42:54.000
they would rather die in the ocean.

368
00:42:57.791 --> 00:42:59.916
My grandma said that if you put your ear…

369
00:43:02.375 --> 00:43:04.791
then you'll hear them singing.

370
00:43:08.875 --> 00:43:11.125
The suffering

371
00:43:12.166 --> 00:43:15.208
Of a child of destiny

372
00:43:16.916 --> 00:43:23.875
A mighty ocean covers my heart

373
00:43:25.666 --> 00:43:32.208
When the time comes. grace will arrive

374
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:41.625
A great ocean

375
00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:45.583
Covers my heart

376
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.416
When it's time. grace will arrive

377
00:44:06.291 --> 00:44:07.291
Oyin. my child.

378
00:44:08.041 --> 00:44:10.166
You understand what I'm telling you.

379
00:44:11.041 --> 00:44:12.416
My husband's people believe

380
00:44:13.416 --> 00:44:14.833
that if one kills a python…

381
00:44:15.833 --> 00:44:18.291
if one kills a python and eats it.

382
00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:21.375
that is a bad omen.

383
00:44:22.416 --> 00:44:26.208
That the community
will gather and place a curse

384
00:44:26.291 --> 00:44:27.375
upon the family

385
00:44:28.083 --> 00:44:29.416
of the one who ate the python.

386
00:44:33.166 --> 00:44:34.291
It's such a big deal.

387
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.833
Why are you not responding?

388
00:44:44.916 --> 00:44:46.208
I'm wondering if you're hearing me.

389
00:44:48.625 --> 00:44:50.291
There's a man I'm in love with.

390
00:44:51.666 --> 00:44:53.791
But Daddy won't allow us to date.

391
00:44:53.875 --> 00:44:56.750
-You said what?!
-He won't allow us to be together.

392
00:44:56.833 --> 00:44:59.666
Oyin… did you say "man"?

393
00:45:00.458 --> 00:45:02.958
Man?! Don't let your father hear it!

394
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.708
Don't even go there!

395
00:45:05.791 --> 00:45:08.291
-Why?
-You ask why?

396
00:45:13.333 --> 00:45:14.541
Water gods. please.

397
00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:16.958
-When you parents got married…
-Give me a child.

398
00:45:17.875 --> 00:45:19.583
-Your mom went…
-Water gods. please.

399
00:45:19.666 --> 00:45:21.708
They didn't have a child
but your mom wanted a child.

400
00:45:22.875 --> 00:45:24.625
They searched and searched for a long time

401
00:45:25.166 --> 00:45:26.375
to no avail.

402
00:45:27.208 --> 00:45:29.041
-Your mom went to the river.
-Gods of the water…

403
00:45:29.625 --> 00:45:31.708
-…give me a child.
-and begged the river goddess

404
00:45:31.791 --> 00:45:33.875
-for a child.
-Gods of the water.

405
00:45:33.958 --> 00:45:36.291
-please give me a child.
-The river goddess gave her a child.

406
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.250
-Gods of the water. thanks.
-And who is that child? Look at her!

407
00:45:39.333 --> 00:45:40.958
-It's you.
-You have done well.

408
00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:46.333
As you have given the child
I asked of you. I thank you!

409
00:45:46.416 --> 00:45:48.458
That's why I said you should never mention

410
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:50.625
anything about a man because

411
00:45:51.125 --> 00:45:53.083
it's a matter of life and death.

412
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:55.166
Do you hear me? Please.

413
00:45:56.708 --> 00:45:58.666
There's a lot at stake. A lot!

414
00:45:59.666 --> 00:46:01.166
Don't go there
because you will not get married.

415
00:46:01.666 --> 00:46:03.958
You will be successful. in your studies.

416
00:46:04.041 --> 00:46:06.250
you can see how successful you are.

417
00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:07.875
Everything you do is successful.

418
00:46:08.416 --> 00:46:10.791
Any business you wish
to do will be successful.

419
00:46:10.875 --> 00:46:13.416
But husband or man.

420
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.375
I don't ever want to hear it from you.

421
00:46:29.125 --> 00:46:30.208
You are still awake?

422
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.041
I can't sleep.

423
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:39.208
Me neither.

424
00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:49.041
Believe it or not…

425
00:46:52.208 --> 00:46:54.125
I've never been away from home this long.

426
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Me too.

427
00:47:06.083 --> 00:47:08.125
I just pray
that this journey is worth it all.

428
00:47:15.041 --> 00:47:16.208
Tell me about your fiancé?

429
00:47:18.291 --> 00:47:19.666
Why don't the other men like him?

430
00:47:29.833 --> 00:47:31.416
his mother still had no child.

431
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:35.166
She got an Igbo girl
to come marry her husband.

432
00:47:35.916 --> 00:47:37.208
The girl had a child.

433
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:41.500
But the man's family
didn't want the child.

434
00:47:42.416 --> 00:47:44.208
Because the child was not of their blood.

435
00:47:46.125 --> 00:47:49.458
They said the child was… omeni.

436
00:47:50.875 --> 00:47:52.500
Because he's the child
from an unwanted woman.

437
00:47:55.083 --> 00:47:56.791
Child of a property-wife.

438
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.041
Take it. Drink.

439
00:48:30.333 --> 00:48:31.291
What is happening to you?

440
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:55.083
What's wrong?

441
00:49:01.583 --> 00:49:03.416
We just wanted to scare them.

442
00:49:04.416 --> 00:49:06.500
We didn't plan to kill anybody.

443
00:49:11.458 --> 00:49:12.583
It's not your fault.

444
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:15.625
You didn't mean it.

445
00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:22.166
Why am I even…

446
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.000
Why am I even telling you this story?

447
00:49:26.291 --> 00:49:27.958
When we don't love ourselves?

448
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.458
Why are you not free with me?

449
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:44.916
Making you refuse to tell me your stories.

450
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.750
Because you think
I'm the child of an inferior?

451
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.541
In here. there is no superior human.

452
00:49:52.583 --> 00:49:53.583
We're all equals.

453
00:49:54.083 --> 00:49:55.958
The most important thing now is…

454
00:49:58.083 --> 00:49:59.583
getting to the outside world.

455
00:50:04.791 --> 00:50:06.125
I feel like drinking alcohol.

456
00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:05.125
Man. my tummy
is seriously dealing with me.

457
00:51:07.625 --> 00:51:09.208
What's really going on?

458
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.875
My stomach is also rumbling.

459
00:51:15.041 --> 00:51:18.041
Man… I want to go search for food.

460
00:51:19.041 --> 00:51:21.958
Nobody should try
to persuade me otherwise.

461
00:51:22.041 --> 00:51:24.875
-Man. it's risky.
-I need to look for food now.

462
00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:26.500
Man…

463
00:51:28.583 --> 00:51:29.500
Man…

464
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.833
Boma. Degbe wants to go look for food.

465
00:51:36.833 --> 00:51:38.958
Degbe. Where are you going?

466
00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:43.541
Take it easy.

467
00:51:43.625 --> 00:51:45.708
Mr. P said we shouldn't leave this place.

468
00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:47.875
Please forget about that.

469
00:51:47.958 --> 00:51:49.875
Just calm down.

470
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.625
Don't go out!

471
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:56.875
He is not even afraid.

472
00:51:56.958 --> 00:51:58.666
-Man.
-Boss.

473
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.833
Be very alert.

474
00:52:14.416 --> 00:52:17.291
I understand. Relax.
I know what's at stake.

475
00:52:19.208 --> 00:52:22.166
You understand? I know what is at stake.

476
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.125
Good luck.

477
00:52:26.791 --> 00:52:28.083
Thank you. my brother.

478
00:52:28.833 --> 00:52:29.750
Thank you.

479
00:56:32.666 --> 00:56:33.791
She has a fever.

480
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:41.000
Man. my friend isn't back here.

481
00:56:54.583 --> 00:56:55.708
I'll be back.

482
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.208
Where are you going?

483
00:57:04.375 --> 00:57:06.166
Where are you going? Hey. man.

484
00:57:07.291 --> 00:57:08.541
Where are you going?

485
00:57:10.666 --> 00:57:12.166
I have to find her some medicine.

486
00:57:19.416 --> 00:57:23.750
Abbey… I'm not sure this is a smart move.

487
00:57:27.875 --> 00:57:28.833
Listen. man…

488
00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:37.458
I will never forgive myself.

489
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.291
Be strong.

490
00:57:52.791 --> 00:57:54.250
Please keep an eye on her while I'm away.

491
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.625
Of course.

492
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.458
I'll look for Degbe and bring him back.

493
01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:05.875
We paid Mr. P.

494
01:00:59.166 --> 01:01:00.083
just relax.

495
01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:02.791
There's no problem.

496
01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:05.291
Everything is cool.

497
01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:08.125
There's lot of food here. you understand?

498
01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:13.291
My friend. you understand?

499
01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:15.250
There's no problem. Just relax.

500
01:01:16.958 --> 01:01:18.166
Just relax.

501
01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:33.458
There's no problem.

502
01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:38.791
My man. sit down. You all should sit.

503
01:01:53.833 --> 01:01:54.916
Help yourselves.

504
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.208
Get something to eat.

505
01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:02.500
Man. relax.

506
01:02:23.708 --> 01:02:25.083
Olotu. tell him what happened.

507
01:02:29.791 --> 01:02:30.833
Mr. P.

508
01:03:08.083 --> 01:03:10.458
Hello there. Mr. P. are you okay?

509
01:03:30.916 --> 01:03:33.833
Man! God forbid!

510
01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:41.833
What kind of nonsense is that?

511
01:04:05.958 --> 01:04:07.500
Sir. there's something

512
01:04:07.583 --> 01:04:08.541
I want--

513
01:04:10.583 --> 01:04:13.166
Why did this man just hang up like that?

514
01:04:16.458 --> 01:04:17.666
Man!

515
01:04:43.208 --> 01:04:45.500
-What do you mean. spies?
-We are not spies.

516
01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:56.833
Men. or are you guys spies?

517
01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:01.500
Because the way
the two of you just came out

518
01:05:01.583 --> 01:05:02.791
from nowhere is suspicious.

519
01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:04.333
I beg you in God's name!

520
01:05:04.416 --> 01:05:06.125
What nonsense talk is that?!

521
01:05:06.208 --> 01:05:07.250
What are you saying?!

522
01:05:07.333 --> 01:05:08.208
-This man is crazy.
-Aren't we all here together?

523
01:05:08.291 --> 01:05:09.541
-Aren't we all here together?
-What?!

524
01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:10.625
-What sort of nonsense is this?
-Man--

525
01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:12.166
-Stop it! Don't yell at me.
-What's wrong with you?

526
01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:13.833
-This guy is bad. Come on!
-I'm talking to you and you're yelling.

527
01:05:13.916 --> 01:05:15.333
Don't yell. You understand?

528
01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:16.916
-How would you suspect us?
-Calm down. we have to relax.

529
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.208
-What's wrong with this guy?!
-Why are you acting this way?

530
01:05:18.291 --> 01:05:19.333
-Do you understand?
-Don't yell at--

531
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.416
My god!

532
01:09:27.458 --> 01:09:30.583
How much to make it all disappear?

533
01:10:45.666 --> 01:10:48.375
Go! Go!

534
01:10:48.458 --> 01:10:50.833
Go!

535
01:10:57.875 --> 01:10:58.708
My brother.

536
01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:08.916
White man… Let us go.

537
01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:34.375
He's bluffing.
He won't hurt you. believe me.

538
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.333
Don't let them go!

539
01:11:39.291 --> 01:11:40.375
I promise you.

540
01:12:09.166 --> 01:12:11.416
Don't close your eyes! Anya. please!

541
01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.708
Look at me! Don't close your eyes!

542
01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:16.333
I'm begging you. don't!

543
01:12:17.916 --> 01:12:19.041
Don't close them!

544
01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:43.500
So. where are you holding those bastards?

545
01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:44.583
In the laundry room.

546
01:14:45.583 --> 01:14:46.583
Good.

547
01:14:49.791 --> 01:14:53.833
I want to be sure
that you find other rats.

548
01:14:55.041 --> 01:14:56.208
Understood?

549
01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:57.333
-Copy that.
-Copy that.

550
01:15:00.916 --> 01:15:02.625
Feed those in the laundry room.

551
01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:04.875
I'll need them tonight.

552
01:15:30.833 --> 01:15:32.083
It's horrible!

553
01:15:47.416 --> 01:15:50.583
So? Have you found the rat?

554
01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.708
No. Aleksei is still seeking.

555
01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:57.875
Are we sure that they are spies?

556
01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:13.916
-Are you questioning my orders?
-No.

557
01:16:16.083 --> 01:16:17.250
We'll find him.

558
01:19:29.083 --> 01:19:30.125
Throw him the knife.

559
01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:14.250
Kill them both. and throw them overboard.

560
01:20:42.708 --> 01:20:44.333
Tekena. what do you think you're doing?

561
01:20:46.916 --> 01:20:48.250
I want to survive.

562
01:21:59.375 --> 01:22:02.375
-Fight! Fight!
-Tekena!

563
01:23:09.833 --> 01:23:12.000
You're seen as the good child
while I'm the bad child.

564
01:23:13.833 --> 01:23:15.666
You get us in trouble
and I take the blame.

565
01:23:17.791 --> 01:23:19.000
Is that what you want to hear?

566
01:23:19.083 --> 01:23:20.125
But we were only children.

567
01:23:20.208 --> 01:23:21.791
You want me to say I'm sorry?
Okay. I'm sorry.

568
01:23:27.291 --> 01:23:28.916
Stop this madness!

569
01:23:58.708 --> 01:23:59.750
Go ahead and do it…

570
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:02.666
Kill me.

571
01:24:04.333 --> 01:24:07.208
Go ahead and do it. Why can't you kill me?

572
01:24:08.833 --> 01:24:10.250
It's because you know

573
01:24:11.916 --> 01:24:13.000
that I'm your blood brother.

574
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:14.583
Fight as we may…

575
01:24:16.333 --> 01:24:20.583
I'm still your brother. no matter what.

576
01:24:27.166 --> 01:24:28.500
I'm still your brother…

577
01:24:31.625 --> 01:24:32.708
Until the very end.

578
01:25:10.791 --> 01:25:12.291
What are we going to do?

579
01:25:15.083 --> 01:25:16.375
I will do something soon.

580
01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:23.250
Take good care of yourself.

581
01:25:42.666 --> 01:25:44.041
My brother!

582
01:25:50.041 --> 01:25:51.625
Promise me you will look after mother.

583
01:25:52.958 --> 01:25:55.416
Why did you do it?

584
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.375
Because you are my brother.

585
01:26:58.875 --> 01:26:59.958
Farewell. comrade.

586
01:27:07.875 --> 01:27:09.958
Igor. they've killed Aleksei.

587
01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:11.916
Those bitches killed him!

588
01:29:43.458 --> 01:29:48.000
Abbey… don't come out. they will kill you.

589
01:31:22.791 --> 01:31:23.916
Switch to him.

590
01:31:25.208 --> 01:31:28.916
Stop.

591
01:34:05.875 --> 01:34:06.916
You're done!

592
01:34:08.291 --> 01:34:10.583
Die. you bastard! Son of a bitch!

593
01:34:10.666 --> 01:34:13.125
You'll see your brother today!

594
01:34:13.208 --> 01:34:15.541
For all that you've done to us.--

595
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:44.833
Boma. what did they do to you?

596
01:36:28.083 --> 01:36:29.500
Are you betrothed to a water spirit?

597
01:36:31.333 --> 01:36:32.333
Yes.

598
01:36:36.208 --> 01:36:37.791
If I get married. I will die.

599
01:36:38.333 --> 01:36:40.250
If I have a child. I will die.

600
01:36:41.791 --> 01:36:43.583
But I know what I want.

601
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:47.916
What about the prophecy?

602
01:36:52.875 --> 01:36:55.333
I thought you don't believe
in spirits and prophecies.

603
01:36:55.416 --> 01:36:56.541
But that is what you believe.

604
01:36:57.166 --> 01:36:58.666
And that is enough to make them real.

605
01:36:59.291 --> 01:37:00.625
I'm not part of them. Abbey.

606
01:37:01.875 --> 01:37:03.500
I want to live life on my own terms.

607
01:37:03.583 --> 01:37:05.875
-What if you die?
-I will not die.

608
01:38:26.125 --> 01:38:27.833
The suffering

609
01:38:29.666 --> 01:38:32.666
-Of a child of destiny
-What is it that you're singing?

610
01:38:34.083 --> 01:38:36.166
When it's time. grace will arrive.

611
01:38:44.041 --> 01:38:45.666
A great ocean

612
01:38:46.666 --> 01:38:49.208
-Is covering my heart
-You can keep on praying

613
01:38:49.291 --> 01:38:52.666
-while I'm slicing your skin.
-Child of destiny.

614
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:07.166
Boma. what have they done to you?

615
01:43:10.625 --> 01:43:12.208
is for the love of my life…

616
01:47:30.291 --> 01:47:31.208
Mother.

617
01:47:35.416 --> 01:47:36.291
Mom.

618
01:48:03.416 --> 01:48:06.000
how did my son die?

619
01:48:08.083 --> 01:48:09.458
I respect your son.

620
01:48:10.041 --> 01:48:10.958
He was a brave man.

621
01:48:16.041 --> 01:48:18.916
What was Degbe doing
with somebody like you?

622
01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:24.500
Why are you worried? We are friends.

623
01:48:25.625 --> 01:48:27.458
During our journey.
this is what came out of it.

624
01:48:28.708 --> 01:48:31.000
My son is dead!

625
01:48:32.125 --> 01:48:36.250
My son cannot have
a guy like you as a friend.

626
01:48:38.833 --> 01:48:40.000
There is money inside.

627
01:48:40.708 --> 01:48:42.333
What I'm giving cannot bring him back.

628
01:48:44.125 --> 01:48:45.166
But it will make you strong.

629
01:48:45.791 --> 01:48:47.833
There's money inside.

630
01:48:57.541 --> 01:48:59.458
What did he bring?

631
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.708
What did he bring? Degbe…

632
01:49:16.833 --> 01:49:17.791
Don't be angry.

633
01:49:18.541 --> 01:49:20.583
I have come to give you some bad news.

634
01:49:24.875 --> 01:49:26.000
You came on account of my son.

635
01:49:27.166 --> 01:49:28.500
To tell me he's dead.

636
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:45.708
Now Olotu has died.

637
01:49:48.458 --> 01:49:52.500
Ma… It's not only Olotu that died.

638
01:49:54.458 --> 01:49:55.791
Tekena is also dead.

639
01:49:59.916 --> 01:50:03.291
My friend… I'm alive.

640
01:50:29.625 --> 01:50:30.458
Tell me…

641
01:50:31.166 --> 01:50:32.250
When did you come back?

642
01:50:33.375 --> 01:50:34.375
Not long ago.

643
01:50:35.666 --> 01:50:37.500
I thought I was the only survivor.

644
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.375
I thought the same thing.

645
01:50:56.875 --> 01:50:57.833
My friend.

646
01:51:01.916 --> 01:51:02.875
What exactly happened?

647
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.875
-Akparaka.
-Great man.

648
01:51:27.250 --> 01:51:28.333
What is happening?

649
01:51:34.333 --> 01:51:35.916
-Akparaka.
-Great man.

650
01:51:36.625 --> 01:51:37.625
What is happening?

651
01:51:41.250 --> 01:51:43.416
Be patient.
they will tell you when they get here.

652
01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:44.458
Are you part of what they want to tell me?

653
01:51:44.541 --> 01:51:45.875
When they get here they'll tell you.

654
01:51:46.791 --> 01:51:48.083
-Be patient.
-Who is that coming?

655
01:51:48.166 --> 01:51:49.958
-Let us be careful when we get here.
-Be calm.

656
01:51:51.833 --> 01:51:53.583
When they arrive. I will be calm.

657
01:51:54.375 --> 01:51:55.958
Let them move quickly and come. please.

658
01:51:56.458 --> 01:51:58.125
I have other things to do.

659
01:51:58.791 --> 01:52:00.583
Whether good or bad news.
they will say it.

660
01:52:12.250 --> 01:52:13.541
Why are you just sitting there?

661
01:52:14.083 --> 01:52:16.000
-Okay. welcome.

Welcome.

665
01:52:21.958 --> 01:52:24.791
Akparaka. why have you not given
your visitors a seat?

666
01:52:24.875 --> 01:52:26.500
Don't you see us standing?

667
01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:29.958
