3
00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:46.792
A baby?

4
00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.042
I'm not having a baby.
What on earth gives you that idea?

5
00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:52.875
I'm not listening to this.
This is quackery.

6
00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.542
But you're about to give birth.

7
00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:57.708
Are you out of your mi…

8
00:02:57.792 --> 00:02:59.708
Mrs. Wormwood.
you're having a contraction.

9
00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:01.250
I'm not having contractions.

10
00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:04.208
Contractions are for pregnant women…

11
00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:08.583
…who are having ba…
…bies!

12
00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:12.042
I'm having a stinking baby!

13
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:10.667
What?

14
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.792
A girl.

15
00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:15.042
What. you mean my son is a girl?

16
00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.000
I mean that your daughter is a girl.

17
00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:19.375
Yeah. but the balloons. Doctor.
I mean…

18
00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:21.375
the balloons. they say "boy."

19
00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:24.458
Mr. Wormwood. your wife has just
given birth to a beautiful. healthy.

20
00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:26.750
happy little girl. She's perfect.

21
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.167
This is fantastic news.

22
00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:09.208
Everything all right. Matilda?

23
00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:11.958
Yes. thank you. Mrs. Phelps.

24
00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:13.958
Only. it's sort of closing time.

25
00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:15.458
Oh. right.

26
00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:17.917
I could stay while you pack up?

27
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.583
When I say "sort of." I mean an hour ago.

28
00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:22.167
I already have packed up.

29
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.333
You looked so peaceful
I didn't want to disturb you.

30
00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:27.625
But I just know your parents cannot wait
to have you back home.

31
00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:30.500
Oh. yeah. they love me home.

32
00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:34.792
Just… love me at home.

33
00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:40.583
Oh. no. it's a disaster. Harry!

34
00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:43.125
We forgot to send it to school!

35
00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:45.708
He goes to school all the time.
don't you. boy?

36
00:06:45.792 --> 00:06:48.625
I'm a girl. and no. I don't.
I've never been to school.

37
00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:50.917
-Where d'you get all the books from?
-From the library.

38
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.375
What. they're doing books now?

39
00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:54.458
Oh. you are such an idiot!

40
00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:56.500
What. me?
I've got a business to run.

41
00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.083
It's not my job to look after brats.

42
00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:01.250
Haven't I got enough stress.
what with all this debt you've put us in?

43
00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:02.417
That <i>I've</i> put us in?

44
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.000
Yeah. yeah. you. Don't you get it?

45
00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:08.750
We're trapped in the chains of debt.

46
00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:11.792
And you. you expect me
to escape like I'm some kind of…

47
00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:13.958
flaming escapologist!

48
00:07:14.042 --> 00:07:17.250
Escapologist. is it?
Well. I have a whole house to run.

49
00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:18.875
Dinners don't microwave themselves.
you know.

50
00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.000
Hello?

51
00:07:21.417 --> 00:07:23.958
-Who the flaming flip's that?
-I was gonna tell you.

52
00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:27.125
The school inspector's here.
He's in the dining room with some floozy.

53
00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:28.500
What are we going to do?

54
00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:30.542
Well…

55
00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:35.083
Dr Martin Luther King once said.
"A lie cannot live."

56
00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:38.833
Yeah.
Yeah. we'll lie our way out of it.

57
00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:40.333
Like what that doctor said.

58
00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:45.042
Home schooling. uh. yeah.

59
00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:46.458
We homeschool that one.

60
00:07:46.542 --> 00:07:47.958
It's all the rage these days.

61
00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:50.917
You know. what with being a businessman
and an entrepreneur.

62
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.958
Well. then. I understand rage.

63
00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:55.458
Okay…

64
00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:59.042
And what kind of education
does she receive here?

65
00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:03.167
Well. I do makeup and Harry does welding.

66
00:08:09.917 --> 00:08:11.750
Matilda. isn't it?

67
00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:15.292
My name's Miss Honey.

68
00:08:17.542 --> 00:08:20.292
So you've been homeschooled. have you?

69
00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:25.000
We were wondering if you'd like
to come to be school-schooled.

70
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.250
We're a few weeks in already.

71
00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:30.583
but. uh. we've another girl
who's missed the start of term too.

72
00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:32.792
You could just join her.

73
00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:34.000
What's it like?

74
00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:35.917
School-school.

75
00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:41.875
Uh… sometimes it can be intense.

76
00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.667
But I promise you my class is just fun.

77
00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:49.667
I'll teach you all about history
and music and literature--

78
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.000
Literature! So. books then?

79
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.000
At school. we have loads of books.
Full of stories.

80
00:08:58.083 --> 00:09:00.000
And we'll even teach you
how to write your own.

81
00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:02.625
How does that sound?

82
00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.458
All right.
look. look. look. I'll sort this.

83
00:09:05.542 --> 00:09:07.125
I'd better go.

84
00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:11.583
Hm.

85
00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:18.583
<i> Once upon a time…</i>

86
00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:21.583
<i>there was a little girl…</i>

87
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.542
<i>who was trapped.</i>

88
00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:27.208
I can't believe that!
Talking to me like that.

89
00:09:27.292 --> 00:09:30.667
How dare they!
I'm getting fined because of you!

90
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.167
It's not my fault!

91
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.750
You forgot to send me to school.

92
00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:37.208
Yeah. well you're going to school now.
and you're gonna meet The Trunchbull.

93
00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:39.167
The Trunchbull?

94
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.958
Agatha Trunchbull.
Headmistress of Crunchem Hall.

95
00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:44.625
Big. strong. scary woman she is.

96
00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:47.750
Used to compete in the Olympics.
Yeah. throwing the hammer.

97
00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:49.875
And guess what I just did?

98
00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:52.667
I called her and told her

99
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:57.458
what a nasty little.
troublemaking goblin you are.

100
00:09:57.542 --> 00:09:58.417
No!

101
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.833
Oh. she is so looking forward
to meeting you!

102
00:10:02.917 --> 00:10:05.375
-That's not fair!

103
00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.083
It's not right!

104
00:10:07.167 --> 00:10:09.625
That oughta teach you.
ruining our life!

105
00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:12.417
Yeah. disgusting little gargoyle.

106
00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:11.917
What have you done to my hair?

107
00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:14.000
Oh.

108
00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:28.042
Why d'you want it green anyway?
Is it a circus thing or…?

109
00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:29.417
What circus thing?

110
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.958
This escapologist you keep going on about.

111
00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:33.458
Does he have green hair?

112
00:13:33.542 --> 00:13:36.667
There is no escapologist.
and I keep telling you I didn't do it.

113
00:13:40.917 --> 00:13:44.708
<i>Escapologist… Escapologist…</i>

114
00:13:44.792 --> 00:13:47.792
<i>Once upon a time.</i>
<i>there was a great escapologist.</i>

115
00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:49.792
<i>He was so kind.</i>

116
00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:52.917
<i>The sort of man any child</i>
<i>would love to have as their father.</i>

117
00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:57.250
<i>And one day he fell in love with…</i>

118
00:13:57.917 --> 00:13:59.625
<i>an acrobat.</i>

119
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.500
Matilda?

120
00:14:20.792 --> 00:14:22.333
Hello. Mrs. Phelps!

121
00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:25.250
School doesn't start
for another hour yet. does it?

122
00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:29.625
Oh. I'm early because of… excitement.

123
00:14:31.042 --> 00:14:33.500
Miss Honey's gonna
teach us to tell stories.

124
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.083
But I think I've got one already.

125
00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:40.042
I can feel it sort of wriggling in me.

126
00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:44.125
-Like it's bursting to get out.
-Well. I think if it's bursting.

127
00:14:44.208 --> 00:14:47.208
you should probably
tell it as soon as possible. don't you?

128
00:14:47.292 --> 00:14:48.833
I'll get us some lemonade.

129
00:14:48.917 --> 00:14:52.083
But it might be a bit… intense.

130
00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:57.792
Matilda Wormwood. stories are my business.
I think I'll be fine.

131
00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:01.208
<i>Once upon a time.</i>

132
00:15:01.792 --> 00:15:05.125
the two greatest circus performers
in the world…

133
00:15:05.208 --> 00:15:10.542
an escapologist. who could
escape from any lock ever invented.

134
00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:13.333
and an acrobat. who was so skilled.

135
00:15:13.417 --> 00:15:15.792
it seemed she could actually fly.

136
00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:18.458
-fell in love and got married.

137
00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:23.000
Together they performed the most
incredible feats anyone had ever seen.

138
00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:25.708
People would come from miles around.

139
00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:29.208
Kings. queens. celebrities and astronauts.

140
00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.500
But despite their love.

141
00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:36.083
despite their fame. they were sad.

142
00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:40.208
"We have everything that
the world has to offer." said the wife.

143
00:15:40.292 --> 00:15:43.208
"But not the one thing in the world
we want most.

144
00:15:44.167 --> 00:15:45.500
We do not have a child."

145
00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:47.208
"Patience my love."

146
00:15:47.292 --> 00:15:50.542
the husband replied.
"Time is on our side.

147
00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:52.542
Even time loves us."

148
00:15:53.333 --> 00:15:56.583
But time is the one thing
no one is master of.

149
00:15:57.167 --> 00:16:00.875
And as time passed.
they grew quite old and still.

150
00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.167
no child.

151
00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:06.375
The sadness of living alone
in their big. empty house

152
00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:09.292
<i>drew them on to ever more dangerous feats.</i>

153
00:16:09.375 --> 00:16:14.125
<i>as work became the only place to escape</i>
<i>the inescapable sorrow of their lives.</i>

154
00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:18.167
And so it was. they decided to perform

155
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.792
the most dangerous feat
ever in the world. ever!

156
00:16:21.875 --> 00:16:23.250
It is called…

157
00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:24.417
Said the acrobat.

158
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.708
announcing the event to the world's press.

159
00:16:26.792 --> 00:16:29.667
who had gathered to listen
with bated breath.

160
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.000
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

161
00:16:33.083 --> 00:16:35.167
With Dynamite in Her Hair

162
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.250
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects…

163
00:16:38.333 --> 00:16:41.833
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage and…

164
00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:46.750
…it is the most dangerous feat
ever in the world ever!

165
00:16:52.917 --> 00:16:54.417
It is our destiny.

166
00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:57.750
It is where the loneliness of life
has led us.

167
00:17:02.667 --> 00:17:05.167
Well. what happened next?

168
00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:08.458
I… I don't know.

169
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.125
Not yet. anyway.

170
00:17:11.708 --> 00:17:13.333
School's open. I'd better go.

171
00:17:13.917 --> 00:17:15.250
But what about the rest of the story?

172
00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:16.750
I'll tell you the rest tomorrow.

173
00:17:16.833 --> 00:17:19.458
Tomorrow?
But I'm over at the lake tomorrow.

174
00:17:19.542 --> 00:17:20.500
The lake. okay.

175
00:17:20.583 --> 00:17:22.958
Well. have a great day at school.

176
00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.167
And… be careful in there.

177
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.083
Oh. I'm not worried.

178
00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:30.917
If people do scary things to you.
you can just do scary things back.

179
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.250
But Matilda. remember.

180
00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:35.667
two wrongs don't make a right.

181
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.042
Unless they do.

182
00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:39.917
In which case you've just made
a right out of two wrongs.

183
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.375
Which has got to be good!

184
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.292
Is it your first day too?

185
00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:54.625
Yes. I'm not worried.
but I think Isaac might be.

186
00:17:56.292 --> 00:17:57.875
What if we went in together?

187
00:17:58.917 --> 00:18:03.042
Yep! That way me and Isaac
can look after you if anything…

188
00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:04.125
You know.

189
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.042
Oi. new kids!

190
00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:24.417
Why?

191
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.958
Why? Did you hear what we said?

192
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.167
What's Phys-Ed?

193
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:35.667
Physical Education.

194
00:19:36.583 --> 00:19:38.292
The Trunchbull speciality.

195
00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:40.500
Who are you?

196
00:19:40.583 --> 00:19:43.375
We're prefects.
We're here to take you to class.

197
00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:45.333
So we're going to start learning?

198
00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:47.042
Oh. you'll start learning. all right.

199
00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:49.333
Great. I already know the alphabet.

200
00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:52.917
You don't know the alphabet
until we learn you the alphabet.

201
00:21:04.042 --> 00:21:04.875
Why?

202
00:21:06.458 --> 00:21:07.333
Why?

203
00:21:07.417 --> 00:21:08.792
Didn't you hear what we said?

204
00:21:10.083 --> 00:21:13.708
<i> I have become aware</i>
<i>that some of you are not yet in class.</i>

205
00:21:13.792 --> 00:21:14.958
<i>Correct this.</i>

206
00:21:15.042 --> 00:21:17.500
<i>You have five seconds to comply.</i>

207
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:19.958
-<i>Five.</i>

208
00:21:21.083 --> 00:21:22.333
-<i>Four.</i>

209
00:21:22.417 --> 00:21:24.875
-<i> Three.</i>

210
00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958
-<i>Two.</i>
-Lavender. Matilda. inside quick.

211
00:21:27.042 --> 00:21:28.792
<i>-One.</i>
<i></i>

212
00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:33.833
Hmm…

213
00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:37.833
Yes. uh. Miss Trunchbull
is keen on punctuality.

214
00:21:37.917 --> 00:21:41.375
Best not to be late.
Now. come and meet your new friends.

215
00:21:41.458 --> 00:21:43.083
This is Lavender and Matilda.

216
00:21:43.667 --> 00:21:46.250
And if there's anything too difficult.

217
00:21:46.833 --> 00:21:48.000
just ask a classmate.

218
00:21:48.083 --> 00:21:49.958
They'll help you. All right?

219
00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:52.125
-Miss!
-Hm?

220
00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:53.750
It's hurting my head.

221
00:21:55.042 --> 00:21:57.542
Oh. no. Nigel. that's not for you.

222
00:21:57.625 --> 00:22:00.792
They use this classroom
for grown-up lessons at night.

223
00:22:00.875 --> 00:22:02.417
They must have left it up there.

224
00:22:05.917 --> 00:22:08.833
Nigel. Nigel. Nigel.

225
00:22:08.917 --> 00:22:10.000
Nigel.

226
00:22:11.292 --> 00:22:14.083
Relax.

227
00:22:15.833 --> 00:22:16.667
Well done.

228
00:22:18.167 --> 00:22:21.333
Now. who would like to
polish off what's on the board?

229
00:22:21.417 --> 00:22:22.875
-Oh. me!
-Miss Honey. me!

230
00:22:25.083 --> 00:22:25.917
Matilda.

231
00:22:26.417 --> 00:22:27.458
How about you?

232
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.125
So… today is reading.

233
00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:39.458
Now. this book
is actually for nine-year-olds…

234
00:22:39.542 --> 00:22:41.750
but you're all doing so well…

235
00:22:41.833 --> 00:22:44.667
that I thought we'd give this a try.

236
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.958
I'd like you all
to read the first chapter.

237
00:22:48.042 --> 00:22:51.625
-Eric. what is a chapter?
-It's a chunk of a story. Miss.

238
00:22:51.708 --> 00:22:53.917
Absolutely perfect. Eric.

239
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.208
What I'm hoping is
that you can all read the first chunk.

240
00:22:57.292 --> 00:23:00.333
then we'll discuss how…

241
00:23:02.208 --> 00:23:04.333
Matilda. what are you doing?

242
00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:08.667
Well. I'm polishing it off.

243
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.125
Like you said.

244
00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:14.042
Oh… No. I meant polish it off.

245
00:23:15.458 --> 00:23:17.667
Is that… correct?

246
00:23:18.167 --> 00:23:19.083
Well. yeah.

247
00:23:19.167 --> 00:23:22.042
And then I thought
I may as well do the rest.

248
00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:23.875
The rest?

249
00:23:24.583 --> 00:23:26.458
You know. the prime numbers.

250
00:23:26.958 --> 00:23:29.042
Where X is the square of AB reoccur.

251
00:23:31.042 --> 00:23:34.250
So I realized they must have done it
knowing it was part of a sequence.

252
00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:37.792
Is maths your favorite thing?

253
00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:41.167
It's okay.
But what I really like is reading.

254
00:23:41.667 --> 00:23:43.583
It's like a holiday in your head.

255
00:23:44.542 --> 00:23:45.917
And do you do that a lot?

256
00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:49.083
Get away from everything.
In books. I mean.

257
00:23:49.167 --> 00:23:51.792
Oh. yeah. I read loads this week.

258
00:23:51.875 --> 00:23:53.875
Loads. In one week?

259
00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:57.417
So. which books did you read this week?

260
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.458
<i>Nicholas Nickleby. Jane Eyre.</i>

261
00:24:00.542 --> 00:24:03.500
<i>Tess of the D'Urbervilles.</i>
<i>Of Mice and Men.</i>

262
00:24:03.583 --> 00:24:04.833
<i>The Lord of the Rings.</i>

263
00:24:05.417 --> 00:24:08.250
<i>Moby Dick. Crime and Punishment.</i>

264
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.375
and…

265
00:24:11.458 --> 00:24:12.750
<i>The Cat in the Hat.</i>

266
00:24:36.542 --> 00:24:37.917
Don't be pathetic.

267
00:24:42.208 --> 00:24:43.750
-Enter.

268
00:24:48.167 --> 00:24:50.250
Don't just stand there
like a wet tissue. get on with it.

269
00:24:50.333 --> 00:24:51.417
Yes. yes. sorry.

270
00:24:54.417 --> 00:24:56.958
So. Miss Trunchbull. there is…

271
00:24:57.042 --> 00:25:00.542
in my class. a girl
called Matilda Wormwood and--

272
00:25:00.625 --> 00:25:03.375
Matilda Wormwood.
daughter of Mr. Harry Wormwood.

273
00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:04.417
Excellent man.

274
00:25:05.125 --> 00:25:06.875
He warned me about the brat though.

275
00:25:07.875 --> 00:25:10.708
Said she's a real… wart.

276
00:25:10.792 --> 00:25:12.667
No. Headmistress. I don't think--

277
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.875
No. No. you do not.

278
00:25:16.333 --> 00:25:18.250
What is the school motto. Miss Honey?

279
00:25:19.333 --> 00:25:21.125
<i>Bambinatum est Maggitum.</i>

280
00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:25.625
<i>Bambinatum est Maggitum.</i>
"Children are maggots."

281
00:25:25.708 --> 00:25:28.250
Thank you for bringing this one
to my attention.

282
00:25:28.333 --> 00:25:30.875
I shall destroy it in due course.
Good day.

283
00:25:32.375 --> 00:25:36.708
Miss Trunchbull. it is my
belief that Matilda Wormwood is a genius.

284
00:25:36.792 --> 00:25:38.917
What? No. No.

285
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.833
Haven't I just told you?
She is a gangster.

286
00:25:41.917 --> 00:25:46.000
She can do maths in her head
that I couldn't do with a calculator.

287
00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:48.250
And the books she's read.

288
00:25:48.333 --> 00:25:52.750
It is my opinion that she should be placed
in the top form with the 11-year-olds.

289
00:25:52.833 --> 00:25:53.833
Immediately.

290
00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:59.125
But what about the rules. Honey?

291
00:26:00.958 --> 00:26:03.375
I believe that Matilda Wormwood is…

292
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.750
an exception to the rules.

293
00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:09.708
An exception?

294
00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:12.125
To the rules?

295
00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:17.250
In my school?

296
00:26:17.333 --> 00:26:19.250
I-- I--

297
00:27:40.833 --> 00:27:44.375
<i>She's done it! She is the best!</i>

298
00:28:11.458 --> 00:28:12.333
Sing. children.

299
00:28:12.417 --> 00:28:13.917
Two. three. four.

300
00:28:37.083 --> 00:28:37.958
Sing. Jenny!

301
00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:30.958
Now get out.

302
00:29:35.542 --> 00:29:37.000
Wormwood.

303
00:29:38.583 --> 00:29:39.792
Wormwood.

304
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.833
Where are you?

305
00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:47.458
Do you want to hear
about my first day at school?

306
00:29:47.542 --> 00:29:50.667
-Yuck. I'd rather eat vegetables.

307
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:53.583
It's official. I'm a genius!

308
00:29:53.667 --> 00:29:55.583
My losing streak is over.

309
00:29:55.667 --> 00:29:58.542
This fella comes into the lot.
Huge he was.

310
00:29:58.625 --> 00:30:00.750
Great big bear of a man.

311
00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:04.000
And this bear of a man wants a luxury car.

312
00:30:04.083 --> 00:30:06.667
Oh. lovely. But do bears drive?

313
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.917
No. He's not a real bear.

314
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.625
Do you have a luxury car?

315
00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:12.375
-I've got two. boy.
-I'm a girl.

316
00:30:12.458 --> 00:30:15.625
One with a smashed-in front.
and one with a smashed-in back.

317
00:30:15.708 --> 00:30:18.083
All I gotta do is cut them in half.

318
00:30:18.167 --> 00:30:21.292
glue them together
and Bob's your chipmunk.

319
00:30:21.375 --> 00:30:22.583
Daddy's back.

320
00:30:22.667 --> 00:30:23.708
But isn't that illegal?

321
00:30:23.792 --> 00:30:27.167
And sort of. well. wrong?

322
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.083
-What'd he say? Wrong?

323
00:30:30.875 --> 00:30:31.708
Wrong?

324
00:30:33.542 --> 00:30:34.667
Give me that.

325
00:30:36.208 --> 00:30:38.500
<i>The Grapes of-- </i>Idiot!

326
00:30:38.583 --> 00:30:40.375
How can grapes be angry?

327
00:30:40.458 --> 00:30:42.417
Hey? What utter junk!

328
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.125
It's not about grapes.

329
00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:45.917
Back-yakking! The little madam!

330
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.250
I'm not back-yakking!

331
00:30:47.333 --> 00:30:48.417
Don't you back-yak me!

332
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.167
I'll rip this book up in front of you.

333
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.458
-No. it's a library book!
-Go on. do it.

334
00:30:59.667 --> 00:31:00.750
Go on.

335
00:31:11.583 --> 00:31:13.042
There!

336
00:31:19.792 --> 00:31:21.292
-There!

337
00:31:22.708 --> 00:31:25.208
Now get to bed. you little bookworm.

338
00:32:18.458 --> 00:32:21.708
But remember Matilda.
two wrongs don't make a right.

339
00:32:21.792 --> 00:32:23.708
Ah. twit face.

340
00:32:24.458 --> 00:32:27.250
"It's a library book.
It's a library book."

341
00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:30.833
Gripy little gremlin.

342
00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:34.292
Where's my hat?

343
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.875
Here it is. Dad.

344
00:32:43.583 --> 00:32:45.250
Big stupid.

345
00:32:55.542 --> 00:32:59.208
But how do they all fit in there?
Her head's the same size as mine.

346
00:32:59.292 --> 00:33:00.875
Does it hurt. Matilda?

347
00:33:00.958 --> 00:33:03.667
Having all those brains squished in there?

348
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.125
No. They seem to just…

349
00:33:07.042 --> 00:33:07.875
fit in.

350
00:33:08.542 --> 00:33:10.208
Can you do telekenipsis?

351
00:33:11.333 --> 00:33:13.458
It's where you have loads of brains.

352
00:33:13.542 --> 00:33:15.500
They squish out through your eyes.

353
00:33:15.583 --> 00:33:18.167
and you can move things with your mind.

354
00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.708
Look. watch this.

355
00:33:38.125 --> 00:33:40.958
It's not good to try to be clever.
Not here.

356
00:33:41.042 --> 00:33:44.208
The Trunchbull hates kids being smart.
She hates it.

357
00:33:44.292 --> 00:33:46.083
Isn't learning what school's for?

358
00:33:46.167 --> 00:33:48.542
This isn't a school. It's a prison.

359
00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:50.000
You don't want to get noticed.

360
00:33:50.083 --> 00:33:51.833
Not by Agatha.

361
00:33:51.917 --> 00:33:54.625
They say she turned one kid inside out.

362
00:33:54.708 --> 00:33:56.875
He had to walk around
in cling film to keep his organs in.

363
00:33:56.958 --> 00:33:58.833
That didn't really happen. Bruce.

364
00:33:58.917 --> 00:34:02.208
But she definitely sat on a year seven
until he was jelly.

365
00:34:02.292 --> 00:34:06.292
She caught Julius Rottwinkle
eating a licorice allsort in class.

366
00:34:06.375 --> 00:34:10.375
She picked him up. swung him around
and chucked him out of the window.

367
00:34:10.458 --> 00:34:11.292
Look.

368
00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:14.292
Teachers don't really throw children.

369
00:34:14.375 --> 00:34:16.667
The big kids are just trying to scare you.

370
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:17.708
Scare. is it?

371
00:34:18.417 --> 00:34:20.958
You don't know scared until
you've been in Chokey.

372
00:34:24.542 --> 00:34:25.792
What's Chokey?

373
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.708
Hide me!

374
00:35:03.792 --> 00:35:06.042
Someone poured a can of treacle
on The Trunchbull's chair.

375
00:35:06.125 --> 00:35:08.000
She thinks I did. but I never!

376
00:35:08.083 --> 00:35:09.667
Her knickers stuck to the seat.

377
00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:12.250
Silence!

378
00:35:12.875 --> 00:35:14.792
You're going to Chokey. kid.

379
00:35:14.875 --> 00:35:17.708
But that's not right!
He didn't do anything.

380
00:35:17.792 --> 00:35:20.167
Take it from me. The boy's doomed.

381
00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.375
Matilda. please help me.

382
00:35:22.458 --> 00:35:24.000
Why not just tell her that…

383
00:35:24.917 --> 00:35:25.833
Okay.

384
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.167
Look. when did this happen?

385
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:30.167
About 20 minutes ago.

386
00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:31.417
But why?

387
00:35:33.375 --> 00:35:35.625
You'd better hide. Quick. blazers!

388
00:35:35.708 --> 00:35:38.417
-Please don't tell her where I am!

389
00:35:40.125 --> 00:35:41.958
Run. run!

390
00:35:42.042 --> 00:35:42.917
Hurry up!

391
00:35:51.958 --> 00:35:54.375
-Be still. child!

392
00:35:57.792 --> 00:36:03.500
What a repellent parade
of imps and hobgoblins.

393
00:36:03.583 --> 00:36:06.917
chitter-chattering away.

394
00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:12.292
Where's the maggot known as Nigel?

395
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.417
Over there. under those blazers.

396
00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:26.375
Where he's been for the last hour!

397
00:36:27.292 --> 00:36:28.125
What?

398
00:36:28.958 --> 00:36:29.792
Yeah.

399
00:36:29.875 --> 00:36:34.375
You see. Nigel suffers from a rare
but chronic sleep disorder. narcolepsy.

400
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
The condition is characterized
by the sufferer

401
00:36:37.083 --> 00:36:39.167
experiencing bouts of fatigue

402
00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.792
and falling asleep without any warning.

403
00:36:41.875 --> 00:36:44.583
He fell asleep and we put him
in the blazers for safety.

404
00:36:45.667 --> 00:36:46.542
Didn't we?

405
00:36:48.667 --> 00:36:49.792
Didn't we?

406
00:36:53.625 --> 00:36:56.125
I had the strangest dream. Mum.

407
00:36:56.708 --> 00:36:57.917
I thought I was…

408
00:36:58.958 --> 00:37:00.417
Oh.

409
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.042
Hello. Miss Trunchbull.

410
00:37:08.583 --> 00:37:10.208
Amanda Thripp.

411
00:37:13.458 --> 00:37:16.917
Y-- y-- yes. Miss Trunchbull?

412
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:23.292
What have I said about… pigtails?

413
00:37:23.875 --> 00:37:26.375
I hate pigtails.

414
00:37:26.458 --> 00:37:28.958
But my mummy likes them.
She says they make me look pretty.

415
00:37:29.042 --> 00:37:31.417
Well. your mother is a twit!

416
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.250
<i>And here she goes!</i>

417
00:37:33.333 --> 00:37:36.375
<i>-Look at that spin!</i>

418
00:37:36.458 --> 00:37:37.958
<i>Oh. my word!</i>

419
00:37:39.375 --> 00:37:41.708
<i>That's far! That's very…</i>

420
00:37:43.042 --> 00:37:44.292
<i>…and we're there!</i>

421
00:37:44.875 --> 00:37:46.583
Yes! Still got it.

422
00:37:47.333 --> 00:37:50.583
Check and see if that child
is still alive. will you?

423
00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:57.500
And what is your name?

424
00:37:57.583 --> 00:37:58.417
Matilda.

425
00:37:59.208 --> 00:38:00.292
Matilda Wormwood.

426
00:38:00.375 --> 00:38:04.458
Oh! You're Wormwood. are you?

427
00:38:05.667 --> 00:38:08.583
I like troublemakers. Wormwood.

428
00:38:09.458 --> 00:38:11.542
They make such a lovely sound…

429
00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:14.375
when they snap.

430
00:38:15.083 --> 00:38:16.500
She's alive!

431
00:38:17.125 --> 00:38:19.250
-Hip. hip!
-Hooray!

432
00:38:19.333 --> 00:38:21.333
-Hip. hip!
-Hooray!

433
00:38:21.417 --> 00:38:23.792
-Hip. hip!
-Hooray!

434
00:38:26.875 --> 00:38:29.958
<i>Remember. Wormwood.</i>
<i>you can never win.</i>

435
00:38:30.042 --> 00:38:34.375
<i>I promise you that.</i>
<i>And a promise is a promise is a promise.</i>

436
00:38:37.292 --> 00:38:39.833
And so the great day arrived.

437
00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:43.375
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

438
00:38:43.458 --> 00:38:45.875
With Dynamite in Her Hair

439
00:38:45.958 --> 00:38:49.250
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

440
00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:51.958
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage.

441
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:57.708
It was like the entire world
had gathered to see the acrobat

442
00:38:57.792 --> 00:39:02.667
and the escapologist's incredible
death-defying feat.

443
00:39:36.333 --> 00:39:38.625
Everything was arranged by…

444
00:39:39.708 --> 00:39:42.167
the acrobat's evil stepsister.

445
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.333
A frightening woman who used to be
an Olympic class hammer thrower.

446
00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:50.125
People whispered that in her dark
and brooding heart.

447
00:39:50.208 --> 00:39:53.833
she resented her stepsister's
success and love.

448
00:39:56.708 --> 00:39:58.042
Suddenly…

449
00:39:58.958 --> 00:40:00.833
out came the escapologist.

450
00:40:00.917 --> 00:40:03.208
but there was no sign of the acrobat.

451
00:40:03.292 --> 00:40:06.917
and no glimpse at all
of the shiny white scarf she always wore.

452
00:40:08.208 --> 00:40:10.125
Ladies and gentlemen.

453
00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:12.500
boys and girls.

454
00:40:12.583 --> 00:40:16.167
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

455
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.875
With Dynamite in Her Hair

456
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:21.292
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

457
00:40:21.375 --> 00:40:23.625
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage

458
00:40:23.708 --> 00:40:26.750
has been canceled!

459
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:33.083
Canceled because my wife is…

460
00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:34.958
pregnant!

461
00:40:35.542 --> 00:40:37.542
-Oh. Matilda.

462
00:40:39.167 --> 00:40:42.292
Absolute… silence.

463
00:40:44.583 --> 00:40:47.250
You could have heard a fly burp.

464
00:40:49.833 --> 00:40:51.708
-Then suddenly. the audience…
-Hip. hip!

465
00:40:51.792 --> 00:40:55.042
…jumped to its feet
and roared in appreciation!

466
00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:03.125
-The great feat was instantly forgotten.

467
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.500
And the applause went on for over an hour!

468
00:41:09.917 --> 00:41:12.625
Oh. Matilda. that's wonderful!

469
00:41:12.708 --> 00:41:14.833
I love stories that end happily.

470
00:41:15.917 --> 00:41:20.708
Forgotten by everyone
except the acrobat's evil stepsister.

471
00:41:22.083 --> 00:41:26.500
When all had quietened down
she produced a contract!

472
00:41:26.583 --> 00:41:28.375
-A contract?

473
00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:31.583
A contract you have signed
to perform this feat.

474
00:41:31.667 --> 00:41:34.583
-And perform this feat. you shall!
-No.

475
00:41:34.667 --> 00:41:37.792
I've paid for the posters. publicity.

476
00:41:37.875 --> 00:41:40.292
the catering. the toilet facilities.

477
00:41:40.375 --> 00:41:42.292
If I give the crowd their money back.

478
00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:43.875
where is my profit?

479
00:41:44.458 --> 00:41:47.333
A contract is a contract is a contract.

480
00:41:47.417 --> 00:41:49.000
My hands are tied.

481
00:41:49.083 --> 00:41:52.292
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

482
00:41:52.375 --> 00:41:54.250
With Dynamite in Her Hair

483
00:41:54.333 --> 00:41:57.000
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

484
00:41:57.083 --> 00:42:00.292
Caught by The Man Locked in a Cage
will be performed.

485
00:42:00.375 --> 00:42:03.000
and it will be performed this day!

486
00:42:03.083 --> 00:42:05.667
Or off to prison you both shall go!

487
00:42:10.042 --> 00:42:11.958
What… what happened next?

488
00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:14.833
I dunno.

489
00:42:14.917 --> 00:42:16.875
What? How can you not know?

490
00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:20.667
It just comes to me in… fizzes.

491
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:23.917
Well. could you fizz up
a little bit more for me? Now.

492
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.250
I don't think it works like that.

493
00:42:26.833 --> 00:42:28.000
Of course it doesn't.

494
00:42:28.625 --> 00:42:32.250
-Where is this coming from. Matilda?
-What do you mean?

495
00:42:32.333 --> 00:42:33.958
I mean. it's incredible.

496
00:42:34.042 --> 00:42:37.000
But it's taking rather a dark turn.

497
00:42:37.083 --> 00:42:38.750
Maybe I shouldn't tell you any more.

498
00:42:38.833 --> 00:42:41.292
No. no. no. No.

499
00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:43.417
We must find out how it ends.

500
00:42:44.458 --> 00:42:46.667
All I'm saying is.
is everything all right?

501
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:47.667
You could tell me.

502
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:51.208
I'd better go. Mrs. Phelps. Mum's waiting.

503
00:42:51.292 --> 00:42:53.833
She gets so upset when she's away from me.

504
00:42:53.917 --> 00:42:57.375
She says every minute
is like an eternity so…

505
00:42:58.167 --> 00:43:00.667
Is she coming here? Can I meet her?

506
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:02.208
Bye. Mrs. Phelps!

507
00:43:02.292 --> 00:43:04.583
Matilda. tomorrow I'm at the windmill.

508
00:43:04.667 --> 00:43:06.417
Okay. I'll find you.

509
00:43:12.625 --> 00:43:14.042
I've got it.

510
00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:16.125
-Harry! Let me have it!

511
00:43:18.083 --> 00:43:19.417
Hang on then.

512
00:43:22.375 --> 00:43:24.458
-You're hurting me!
-Yeah. Hold on. hold on.

513
00:43:28.417 --> 00:43:30.250
Let me pull. Harry.

514
00:43:30.333 --> 00:43:31.333
Pull then!

515
00:44:01.625 --> 00:44:02.458
Matilda.

516
00:44:05.958 --> 00:44:08.333
I believe your mind is extraordinary.

517
00:44:08.875 --> 00:44:11.500
So I'm taking things into my own hands.

518
00:44:12.625 --> 00:44:13.917
Starting tomorrow.

519
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.500
I'm going to bring in a selection
of very clever books.

520
00:44:16.583 --> 00:44:19.083
You can sit and read them
while I teach the others.

521
00:44:19.167 --> 00:44:21.958
and if you have any questions. well…

522
00:44:22.042 --> 00:44:23.750
I shall do my best to answer them.

523
00:44:25.042 --> 00:44:26.250
How does that sound?

524
00:44:33.542 --> 00:44:34.708
Matilda…

525
00:44:36.167 --> 00:44:37.792
That is the biggest hug in the world.

526
00:44:39.125 --> 00:44:41.333
You're going to hug all the air out of me.

527
00:44:43.792 --> 00:44:45.833
What a touching little scene.

528
00:44:50.167 --> 00:44:51.042
Move!

529
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:56.833
I believe I said this maggot
was to receive no special treatment.

530
00:44:56.917 --> 00:45:00.167
In fact. I seem to recall informing you

531
00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:05.917
that this particular snot-ball
was evil incarnate. did I not?

532
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.625
No. Miss Trunchbull. Matilda is not--

533
00:45:07.708 --> 00:45:09.417
Did you just say "no." Jenny?

534
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:11.833
To me?

535
00:45:14.792 --> 00:45:18.167
Matilda Wormwood is a criminal.

536
00:45:19.875 --> 00:45:21.042
This morning.

537
00:45:21.125 --> 00:45:25.417
a piece of my private
chocolate cake was stolen.

538
00:45:27.667 --> 00:45:31.292
It is my contention that you performed
this vileness. Wormwood. you.

539
00:45:31.375 --> 00:45:33.917
You have two choices.
admit your guilt and be punished.

540
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.625
or call me a liar… and be punished.

541
00:45:39.917 --> 00:45:41.667
Think very carefully

542
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:45.083
about what comes out
of your mouth. Wormwood.

543
00:45:45.667 --> 00:45:47.458
I did not stea--

544
00:46:21.875 --> 00:46:23.250
Chocolate.

545
00:46:23.958 --> 00:46:26.292
Bruce Bogtrotter.

546
00:46:28.458 --> 00:46:30.625
Yes. Miss Trunchbull?

547
00:46:32.083 --> 00:46:34.417
Thank you. Maurice. that will be all.

548
00:46:37.708 --> 00:46:41.958
Staff dismissed. Come on.
Everybody out. Everybody out. come on.

549
00:46:42.042 --> 00:46:42.958
Move!

550
00:46:55.125 --> 00:46:56.750
You liked my cake…

551
00:46:57.708 --> 00:46:58.833
didn't you. Bruce?

552
00:46:58.917 --> 00:47:02.000
Yes. Miss Trunchbull.
it was very delicious.

553
00:47:02.083 --> 00:47:03.542
So chocolatey.

554
00:47:04.125 --> 00:47:06.000
And I'm really very sorry. I--

555
00:47:06.083 --> 00:47:06.917
No. no…

556
00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:11.042
Just so long as you enjoyed the cake.
That's the main thing.

557
00:47:12.333 --> 00:47:13.167
Is it?

558
00:47:14.708 --> 00:47:16.250
Oh. Cook.

559
00:47:38.292 --> 00:47:39.125
Be still!

560
00:47:42.208 --> 00:47:44.500
What's the matter. Bogtrotter?
Lost your appetite?

561
00:47:45.042 --> 00:47:48.750
Don't worry… all you have to do
is eat every last crumb.

562
00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:54.125
And if you perform this incredible feat.
I promise you.

563
00:47:54.208 --> 00:47:56.042
all will be forgiven.

564
00:47:56.125 --> 00:47:58.042
Every crumb?

565
00:47:59.167 --> 00:48:01.333
-But I'm full.
-Oh. no. you're not full.

566
00:48:01.417 --> 00:48:04.792
I'll tell you when you're full.
And I say that criminals like you

567
00:48:04.875 --> 00:48:07.375
aren't full until they've
eaten the entire cake.

568
00:48:08.583 --> 00:48:11.458
-But--
-You haven't got time for "buts." Eat.

569
00:48:11.542 --> 00:48:13.042
But I can't eat it all.

570
00:48:13.125 --> 00:48:14.667
Headmistress. he'll be sick.

571
00:48:15.875 --> 00:48:18.458
He should have thought of that
before he made a pact with Satan

572
00:48:18.542 --> 00:48:20.375
and decided to steal my cake.

573
00:48:20.875 --> 00:48:22.708
-Eat.
-He can't!

574
00:48:22.792 --> 00:48:24.500
-Eat.
-He surely can't!

575
00:48:24.583 --> 00:48:26.292
-Eat!
-He might explode!

576
00:48:26.375 --> 00:48:27.583
Eat!

577
00:50:48.458 --> 00:50:52.375
Go on. Brucie!

578
00:50:55.625 --> 00:50:57.250
Uh… uh…

579
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.417
Sorry. Miss Trunchbull. I…

580
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.292
…got carried away.

581
00:51:04.375 --> 00:51:06.250
Oh. that's okay. Jenny.

582
00:51:06.333 --> 00:51:08.958
We all get carried away sometimes.

583
00:51:09.042 --> 00:51:09.875
Even me.

584
00:51:19.875 --> 00:51:22.167
Well. come along. Bogtrotter.

585
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.750
-What?
-Oh. did I not mention?

586
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.250
That was the first part
of your punishment. there's more.

587
00:51:27.333 --> 00:51:30.458
There's a second part.
and the second part is Chokey.

588
00:51:32.792 --> 00:51:34.875
Miss Trunchbull. please. you can't!
He's too young.

589
00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:37.958
But I ate it all. I did it. Please!

590
00:51:38.042 --> 00:51:39.875
Not that. Please!

591
00:51:39.958 --> 00:51:42.000
-No!

592
00:51:42.083 --> 00:51:44.917
You said if he ate
every crumb he'd be forgiven.

593
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.167
He ate every crumb. We all saw it!

594
00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:50.208
He did it in front of everyone!

595
00:51:50.292 --> 00:51:52.208
You can't just change the rules.

596
00:51:52.292 --> 00:51:55.125
That's not right. It's cheating!

597
00:51:56.542 --> 00:51:58.000
You just said…

598
00:51:59.917 --> 00:52:00.833
"No."

599
00:52:02.292 --> 00:52:03.333
To me.

600
00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:09.542
-Come on. Bogtrotter.
-Please!

601
00:52:15.333 --> 00:52:16.583
-Come on!
-No!

602
00:52:16.667 --> 00:52:18.708
Wormwood will be dealt with in due course.

603
00:52:18.792 --> 00:52:21.458
As will the rest of these maggots.

604
00:52:21.542 --> 00:52:23.583
I ate it. I ate it all.

605
00:52:23.667 --> 00:52:25.625
No. please. Miss Trunchbull!

606
00:52:25.708 --> 00:52:27.250
Not the Chokey!

607
00:52:27.917 --> 00:52:29.042
I ate every crumb.

608
00:52:29.125 --> 00:52:30.667
Please!

609
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.917
Not the Chokey! Please. not the Chokey!

610
00:52:37.708 --> 00:52:41.917
<i>You see. children. I will always win.</i>

611
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.583
<i>And you will always lose.</i>

612
00:52:45.458 --> 00:52:49.542
<i>Because you are weak. tiny. titchy…</i>

613
00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:51.917
<i>and insignificant.</i>

614
00:56:28.792 --> 00:56:31.917
Mrs. Phelps! Where's the revenge section?

615
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.250
Well. we don't have a revenge section.
Is it a bully?

616
00:56:36.833 --> 00:56:40.042
'Cause you know the best way
to deal with bullies is tell someone.

617
00:56:40.625 --> 00:56:43.292
Straight away. They thrive on silence.

618
00:56:43.875 --> 00:56:47.250
Tell a teacher.
Or better still. the headmistress.

619
00:56:48.208 --> 00:56:50.792
I think I've got the next part
of the story.

620
00:56:50.875 --> 00:56:52.167
But I shall warn you.

621
00:56:53.292 --> 00:56:54.667
it's about to get real.

622
00:56:58.708 --> 00:57:02.083
Slowly. the acrobat
tied her shiny white scarf

623
00:57:02.167 --> 00:57:03.750
around her husband's wrist.

624
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.125
For luck. my love.

625
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.542
Then she hugged him
with the biggest hug in the world.

626
00:57:10.625 --> 00:57:14.792
So hard that he felt that
she could hug all the air out of him.

627
00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:19.542
And so they prepared themselves

628
00:57:19.625 --> 00:57:23.125
for the most dangerous feat
that had ever been performed.

629
00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:46.167
The great escapologist had to somehow
escape from the padlocks.

630
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:51.625
break free from the cage. and attempt
to rescue his wife within 12 seconds.

631
00:57:51.708 --> 00:57:54.458
Or she would be blown to bits!

632
00:58:09.542 --> 00:58:14.000
The moment the fuse was lit.
the acrobat swung into the air.

633
00:58:14.083 --> 00:58:16.292
-One second. two seconds…

634
00:58:16.375 --> 00:58:17.875
…the crowd held their breath

635
00:58:17.958 --> 00:58:22.958
as she swung higher and higher
above the sharks and spiky objects!

636
00:58:23.042 --> 00:58:25.167
Three seconds. four seconds.

637
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.667
The evil sister looked on gleefully.

638
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:30.042
-Five seconds. six seconds.

639
00:58:30.125 --> 00:58:32.250
The escapologist
couldn't take his eyes from his wife

640
00:58:32.333 --> 00:58:34.458
as he struggled in his chains.

641
00:58:34.542 --> 00:58:37.458
knowing that the tiniest. weeniest mistake

642
00:58:37.542 --> 00:58:40.417
would mean that he'd lose her
and their child forever.

643
00:58:41.042 --> 00:58:43.125
Seven seconds. and suddenly…

644
00:58:43.208 --> 00:58:45.458
-She let go!

645
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:52.292
The escapologist reached out
with one huge. massive arm

646
00:58:52.375 --> 00:58:53.625
to catch his wife and the child.

647
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.333
-Eight seconds!
-No. I can't look.

648
00:58:57.417 --> 00:59:00.542
Nine seconds! Ten seconds! And…

649
00:59:01.208 --> 00:59:04.583
And… And… Eleven seconds!

650
00:59:04.667 --> 00:59:09.333
He grabbed the dynamite
and flung it far. far away!

651
00:59:09.417 --> 00:59:13.333
Hurray! So this story does
have a happy ending after all.

652
00:59:14.167 --> 00:59:15.000
No.

653
00:59:16.667 --> 00:59:17.583
No. it doesn't.

654
00:59:30.875 --> 00:59:34.042
No! Was she okay? Did she survive?

655
00:59:34.625 --> 00:59:37.292
She broke every bone in her body.

656
00:59:37.958 --> 00:59:40.167
Except the ones at the ends
of her little fingers.

657
00:59:41.125 --> 00:59:44.042
She did manage to live long enough
to have their child.

658
00:59:47.958 --> 00:59:49.625
But the effort was too great.

659
00:59:51.208 --> 00:59:52.833
Love our girl.

660
00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:58.042
Love our daughter with all your heart.

661
00:59:59.667 --> 01:00:02.458
She is all we ever wanted.

662
01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:13.875
And then she died.

663
01:00:16.708 --> 01:00:17.750
And then…

664
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.125
things got worse.

665
01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:21.750
What? Worse?

666
01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:23.417
I'm afraid they did.

667
01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.875
Because the escapologist was so kind

668
01:00:25.958 --> 01:00:30.042
that he never for one second blamed
the evil stepsister for what happened.

669
01:00:30.917 --> 01:00:35.708
In fact. he asked her to move in
and help look after his daughter.

670
01:00:35.792 --> 01:00:38.167
<i> No. no.</i>
<i>don't ask her to move in.</i>

671
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.500
She was nothing but cruel
to the little girl.

672
01:00:40.583 --> 01:00:43.708
making her wash and clean
all day long. Shouting.

673
01:00:43.792 --> 01:00:46.208
"Clean the floor and I'll be nice!"

674
01:00:46.292 --> 01:00:49.458
When the little girl did clean it.
she was even crueler

675
01:00:49.542 --> 01:00:52.417
because she was
a terrible. terrible cheat!

676
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.625
I hate cheats!

677
01:00:53.708 --> 01:00:57.667
All in secret. so the escapologist
never suspected a thing.

678
01:00:57.750 --> 01:01:00.750
And so the poor little girl grew up
with the meanest. cruelest.

679
01:01:00.833 --> 01:01:03.875
horriblest aunt
you could possibly imagine!

680
01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:06.042
Let's call the police!

681
01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:08.208
Mrs. Phelps.

682
01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:10.667
It's just a story.

683
01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.125
What?

684
01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:16.708
Oh. Yes. of course.

685
01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:18.375
A story.

686
01:01:19.167 --> 01:01:21.500
It's just. you make it so real.

687
01:01:22.375 --> 01:01:24.083
Your mind. Matilda.

688
01:01:24.583 --> 01:01:28.042
Your parents must think they've won
the lottery with a child like you.

689
01:01:28.667 --> 01:01:30.708
Oh… they do.

690
01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:33.250
They're always saying that.

691
01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:35.833
In fact. they say.

692
01:01:35.917 --> 01:01:39.500
"We're so proud of you. Matilda.
you're like winning the…"

693
01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:45.750
Yeah. I'd better go.

694
01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:53.833
It's just like winning the lottery!

695
01:01:53.917 --> 01:01:54.917
What?

696
01:01:55.542 --> 01:01:56.708
Me?

697
01:01:56.792 --> 01:01:59.250
You? No. you're like
eating someone else's bogeys.

698
01:01:59.333 --> 01:02:01.583
Like winning a snottery. you. boy.

699
01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:02.708
I'm a girl.

700
01:02:02.792 --> 01:02:04.542
But how. Harry?

701
01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:06.208
Remember that big. muscly idiot?

702
01:02:06.292 --> 01:02:08.958
Turns out he had a whole lot
of muscly mates.

703
01:02:09.042 --> 01:02:10.625
Bucketloads of cash.

704
01:02:10.708 --> 01:02:13.042
Everyone wanting a luxury car.

705
01:02:13.125 --> 01:02:17.292
All I had was a load of old bangers.
each with 100.000 miles on the clock.

706
01:02:17.375 --> 01:02:20.375
So. I did what any decent
business leader would.

707
01:02:20.458 --> 01:02:21.500
What?

708
01:02:21.583 --> 01:02:22.875
I bought a drill.

709
01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:26.875
Attached it to the speedometer
and whacked it in reverse.

710
01:02:26.958 --> 01:02:29.417
I put back the mileage
on every one of those cars

711
01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:33.083
and sold them to those big.
muscly idiots. resulting in…

712
01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:34.875
Money!

713
01:02:34.958 --> 01:02:36.083
But you cheated them!

714
01:02:37.417 --> 01:02:38.333
Excuse me?

715
01:02:38.417 --> 01:02:41.875
You cheated them.
What you did. it wasn't right.

716
01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:43.417
You're just a cheat!

717
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.375
Oh. the little pig!

718
01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.875
It's the books. Harry.
It's the books and the stories.

719
01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:52.250
Is it now?

720
01:02:53.125 --> 01:02:53.958
Books. is it?

721
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.500
You know what I'm going to do tomorrow?

722
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.583
I'm going to go down to that library.

723
01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:05.750
I'm going to tell that old bag
to never let you in again.

724
01:03:05.833 --> 01:03:07.125
What?

725
01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:10.000
Always sticking your nose in
where it don't belong.

726
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:14.875
You nasty little creep!

727
01:03:22.958 --> 01:03:27.667
That night. the escapologist's daughter
cried herself to sleep.

728
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:31.458
She never said a word
about the evil step-aunt's bullying.

729
01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:33.875
She didn't want to add
to her father's pain.

730
01:03:34.583 --> 01:03:38.083
This only encouraged the woman
to greater cruelties.

731
01:03:38.167 --> 01:03:41.500
until one day she exploded.

732
01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:45.042
Sticking your
nose in where it doesn't belong!

733
01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:47.458
You nasty little creep!

734
01:03:47.542 --> 01:03:50.667
And she threw her…
threw her into a dank.

735
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:54.292
dark. dusty cellar.
locked the door and went out.

736
01:03:57.417 --> 01:04:01.083
But that night. the escapologist
happened to come home early.

737
01:04:02.667 --> 01:04:05.542
<i>And when he heard the sound</i>
<i>of his daughter's tears.</i>

738
01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:08.000
-he smashed the door open.

739
01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:58.458
Have I been
so wrapped up in my grief

740
01:04:58.542 --> 01:05:00.375
that I've forgotten the thing
that matters most?

741
01:05:00.958 --> 01:05:03.750
I love you so much. my daughter.

742
01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:07.083
I shall spend the rest of my life
making it up to you.

743
01:05:59.667 --> 01:06:01.833
<i>But when the little girl slept.</i>

744
01:06:01.917 --> 01:06:05.625
<i>the escapologist's thoughts</i>
<i>turned to the evil stepsister</i>

745
01:06:05.708 --> 01:06:08.750
<i>and a mighty rage</i>
<i>grew inside his great heart!</i>

746
01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:11.708
This demon. this monster.

747
01:06:11.792 --> 01:06:13.625
Bullying children is her game. is it?

748
01:06:14.292 --> 01:06:16.583
<i>And as the unfairness</i>
<i>of the aunt's cruelty</i>

749
01:06:16.667 --> 01:06:18.583
<i>spun around inside him.</i>

750
01:06:18.667 --> 01:06:22.458
<i>it swirled and whirled</i>
<i>into a great storm of fury</i>

751
01:06:22.542 --> 01:06:25.167
that his mind could no longer contain.

752
01:06:32.292 --> 01:06:35.125
<i>And that was the last</i>
<i>the little girl ever saw of him.</i>

753
01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:40.583
Because he never came home. ever again.

754
01:06:54.542 --> 01:06:56.292
<i>Can you do telekenipsis?</i>

755
01:06:56.875 --> 01:06:58.958
<i>It's where you have loads of brains.</i>

756
01:06:59.042 --> 01:07:00.875
<i>They squish out through your eyes</i>

757
01:07:00.958 --> 01:07:03.333
<i>and you can move things with your mind.</i>

758
01:07:17.542 --> 01:07:20.333
Matilda. This is for you.

759
01:07:23.417 --> 01:07:24.417
Thank you.

760
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.417
Matilda. here you are.

761
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.292
Isn't it a splendid day. old pal?

762
01:07:36.375 --> 01:07:39.542
-Lavender. what is going on?
-You. you're a hero.

763
01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:40.750
Here. Matilda.

764
01:07:42.083 --> 01:07:44.292
Egg and cress. Stephanie? Really!

765
01:07:45.917 --> 01:07:47.083
A hero?

766
01:07:47.167 --> 01:07:49.583
Yes. You're leading a revolution.

767
01:07:49.667 --> 01:07:52.833
-What revolution?
-You said "no" to The Trunchbull.

768
01:07:52.917 --> 01:07:55.000
See. no one's done that before.

769
01:07:58.917 --> 01:08:00.875
<i>You're leading a revolution.</i>

770
01:08:00.958 --> 01:08:02.625
<i>You said "no" to The Trunchbull.</i>

771
01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:04.958
<i>No one's done that before.</i>

772
01:08:10.875 --> 01:08:12.208
Ready for a little fun?

773
01:08:12.292 --> 01:08:13.542
Yeah!

774
01:08:13.625 --> 01:08:15.417
-Fun?

775
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.250
Did you say "fun"?

776
01:08:23.167 --> 01:08:26.458
It is not our job
to make things fun.

777
01:08:26.542 --> 01:08:30.500
We are not here to encourage or nurture.

778
01:08:30.583 --> 01:08:33.250
We are here to crush them until…

779
01:08:34.333 --> 01:08:36.375
the wriggling stops.

780
01:08:36.458 --> 01:08:40.750
Well. I… I don't actually
believe that… that the--

781
01:08:40.833 --> 01:08:44.750
D-d-d-do you. Jenny?
D-d-d-do you think anyone c-c-c-cares?

782
01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:49.042
This class is full of rebels.

783
01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:52.458
and they need a real lesson.

784
01:08:53.042 --> 01:08:55.917
Bring your gym gear
and change on the way.

785
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.333
You see. Jenny.

786
01:08:57.417 --> 01:09:00.458
to teach the child. we must first break…

787
01:09:01.458 --> 01:09:02.583
the child.

788
01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:43.042
Come along. squits.

789
01:09:43.125 --> 01:09:45.042
I'll take it from here. Jenny!

790
01:11:32.917 --> 01:11:34.708
<i>What a champion!</i>

791
01:11:34.792 --> 01:11:36.958
<i>Agatha Trunchbull. has done it again!</i>

792
01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:39.708
<i>What an athlete. what a winner!</i>

793
01:12:39.042 --> 01:12:40.917
She's mad.

794
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:49.250
Right. Let's get you out.

795
01:13:51.625 --> 01:13:53.458
This isn't teaching!

796
01:13:53.542 --> 01:13:55.500
This is cruelty.

797
01:13:57.208 --> 01:13:59.250
Cruelty? Well. yes. Of course.

798
01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:00.333
-Go on. boy.

799
01:14:00.417 --> 01:14:02.125
You did say it was going to be fun.

800
01:14:03.792 --> 01:14:05.708
But-- but this isn't fun!

801
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.875
Miss Honey. you are pathetic!

802
01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:11.083
You are… weak

803
01:14:12.667 --> 01:14:14.375
You are… wet.

804
01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:16.417
You are. in fact…

805
01:14:18.625 --> 01:14:20.542
…a sniveling little…

806
01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:23.958
…newt.

807
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:35.958
You!

808
01:14:37.417 --> 01:14:39.208
No. What? Me?

809
01:14:39.292 --> 01:14:42.583
No. no. I didn't. I didn't. No!

810
01:14:43.958 --> 01:14:45.167
Don't you pull his ears off.

811
01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:48.292
I have discovered. Miss Honey.

812
01:14:48.375 --> 01:14:49.958
through years of experimentation.

813
01:14:50.042 --> 01:14:52.667
that the ears of small boys
do not come off!

814
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:55.125
-They stretch.

815
01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.792
-Please!

816
01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:03.000
Leave him alone!

817
01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:07.917
You stupid. horrible. bully!

818
01:15:14.958 --> 01:15:17.333
How dare you.

819
01:15:18.917 --> 01:15:22.875
You are not fit to be in this school.

820
01:15:25.167 --> 01:15:26.708
You are evil.

821
01:15:27.542 --> 01:15:30.125
I shall crush you. I shall pound you.

822
01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:35.042
I shall dissect you. madam.

823
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:17.042
<i>-Are you listening. you revolting little--
</i>

824
01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:21.333
-You idiot! You revolting--

825
01:18:47.083 --> 01:18:50.083
…you revolting little bloodworm.

826
01:18:55.625 --> 01:18:57.458
This is the end of your rebellion.

827
01:18:58.083 --> 01:19:00.792
You have leapt through the gates of Hades.

828
01:19:00.875 --> 01:19:03.667
Do you hear? I am going to tear you apart.

829
01:19:04.542 --> 01:19:08.875
…horrible. repellent. disgusting.
nauseating…

830
01:19:12.958 --> 01:19:14.292
Who did that?

831
01:19:16.667 --> 01:19:18.833
A-are you all right. Miss Trunchbull?

832
01:19:19.708 --> 01:19:23.083
Oh! Oh…

833
01:19:23.167 --> 01:19:25.875
Oh. oh. oh.

834
01:19:27.792 --> 01:19:29.792
Oh God. the newt!

835
01:19:29.875 --> 01:19:34.542
It's-- it's-- it's in my--
it's in my knickers!

836
01:19:34.625 --> 01:19:39.792
It's in my knickers!

837
01:19:40.917 --> 01:19:45.458
I've got a newt in my knickers!

838
01:19:45.542 --> 01:19:48.792
Okay. That was odd.

839
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.958
Right. Everyone. back to class.

840
01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:59.125
And please. please keep your heads down
for the rest of the day.

841
01:20:01.833 --> 01:20:02.667
Matilda.

842
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:04.417
I need to show you something.

843
01:20:06.125 --> 01:20:07.417
Watch. Miss Honey.

844
01:20:09.167 --> 01:20:11.292
Matilda. if Miss Trunchbull sees--

845
01:20:11.375 --> 01:20:12.792
Just watch. Please.

846
01:20:19.792 --> 01:20:21.750
-I-I think we should go. before--
-Wait.

847
01:20:59.708 --> 01:21:01.708
I moved it with my eyes.

848
01:21:03.542 --> 01:21:04.792
Am I strange?

849
01:21:08.708 --> 01:21:11.500
How do you fancy a… nice cup of tea?

850
01:21:23.292 --> 01:21:25.250
Oh. no. no. no.
Not that way. This way.

851
01:21:26.917 --> 01:21:30.292
What do you think it is?
This thing with my eyes.

852
01:21:31.042 --> 01:21:32.583
Well. what did it feel like?

853
01:21:34.042 --> 01:21:35.417
Felt like fizzing.

854
01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:37.167
Fizzing.

855
01:21:38.125 --> 01:21:40.208
But not bad fizzing. good fizzing.

856
01:21:41.125 --> 01:21:42.208
Good fizzing.

857
01:21:43.083 --> 01:21:45.125
Good fizzing. Hm…

858
01:21:45.792 --> 01:21:47.958
Okay. let's see.

859
01:21:48.875 --> 01:21:52.500
I'm no expert because I'm not sure
there are experts in fizzing.

860
01:21:52.583 --> 01:21:56.292
but I think it has something to do
with that incredible mind of yours.

861
01:21:57.458 --> 01:22:00.292
You mean. there's no room in my head
for all my brains?

862
01:22:00.375 --> 01:22:02.625
So they have to squish out
through my eyes?

863
01:22:03.375 --> 01:22:06.583
Well. yes.
Yes. that's exactly what I mean.

864
01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:10.375
Well. here we are.

865
01:22:11.083 --> 01:22:12.125
Where are we?

866
01:22:19.917 --> 01:22:21.000
Wow.

867
01:22:21.083 --> 01:22:23.500
They pay teachers really badly.

868
01:22:24.875 --> 01:22:28.542
-Well. actually. yes. they do.

869
01:22:29.417 --> 01:22:31.292
But I'm poorer even than most.

870
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.583
You see. my father died when I was young.

871
01:22:38.667 --> 01:22:42.042
Magnus was his name. He was so kind.

872
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:46.125
But… when he was gone.

873
01:22:46.208 --> 01:22:48.708
my aunt became my legal guardian.

874
01:22:49.375 --> 01:22:54.208
And she was cruel and mean
like you cannot even imagine.

875
01:22:54.792 --> 01:22:58.375
Then when I became a teacher.
she presented me with a bill.

876
01:22:59.167 --> 01:23:00.542
She'd written everything down.

877
01:23:00.625 --> 01:23:04.958
Every teabag. every gas bill.
every tin of beans.

878
01:23:05.042 --> 01:23:08.750
She made me sign a contract
to pay her back every single penny.

879
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:10.083
Really?

880
01:23:10.167 --> 01:23:13.917
She even produced a document that said
that my father gave her his house.

881
01:23:14.875 --> 01:23:17.750
But did he really do that. Magnus.

882
01:23:17.833 --> 01:23:19.875
did he just give her his house?

883
01:23:20.917 --> 01:23:25.000
Well. I've always felt it was…
suspicious.

884
01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:28.917
You see. she said his death
was an accident. but…

885
01:23:30.583 --> 01:23:32.125
You think she did him in!

886
01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:36.875
Well. I cannot say for sure.

887
01:23:38.333 --> 01:23:43.750
All I really know is that years of being
bullied by that woman made me. well…

888
01:23:45.208 --> 01:23:46.375
pathetic.

889
01:23:48.292 --> 01:23:52.125
Then one day. I came across this old shed.

890
01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:54.708
I fell in love with it.

891
01:23:56.167 --> 01:23:59.292
I begged the farmer who owned it
to let me move in.

892
01:24:00.208 --> 01:24:02.500
He thought I was mad. but…

893
01:24:03.583 --> 01:24:05.417
he said "yes." and…

894
01:24:07.458 --> 01:24:09.167
And that's why you live here.

895
01:24:59.542 --> 01:25:01.375
But Miss Honey.
she's got your father's house.

896
01:25:01.458 --> 01:25:03.417
She's got everything that's yours.

897
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.625
Where did you get this scarf?

898
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.667
Oh. it was my father's.

899
01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.958
Mum gave it to him before she died.

900
01:27:48.042 --> 01:27:49.875
-She was an--
-An acrobat.

901
01:27:50.667 --> 01:27:53.917
Uh. well. yes. she was. She…

902
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.167
H-- How did you…

903
01:27:58.042 --> 01:28:00.625
-And my father was an esca--
-An escapologist.

904
01:28:01.375 --> 01:28:03.167
Matilda. how do you know that?

905
01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:05.458
So they were <i>your </i>parents.

906
01:28:05.542 --> 01:28:07.542
What? Who?

907
01:28:07.625 --> 01:28:09.000
The people in my story.

908
01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:11.125
I thought I was making it up.
but it's real!

909
01:28:11.208 --> 01:28:12.958
It's you. it's your life.

910
01:28:13.042 --> 01:28:15.292
Miss Honey. who's your aunt?

911
01:28:15.375 --> 01:28:19.417
Well. actually Matilda.
she's… my step-aunt.

912
01:28:20.208 --> 01:28:21.208
Miss Trunchbull!

913
01:28:21.292 --> 01:28:24.917
A contract is a contract is a contract
is a contract!

914
01:28:28.458 --> 01:28:29.292
Matilda.

915
01:28:30.125 --> 01:28:31.125
Matilda. listen to me!

916
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.583
You must forget all this!
You need to be very careful.

917
01:28:36.333 --> 01:28:40.083
Miss Trunchbull has been humiliated.
and she is capable of awful things.

918
01:28:40.167 --> 01:28:41.750
I'm not scared of her.

919
01:28:41.833 --> 01:28:44.375
You should be. She's dangerous.

920
01:28:45.125 --> 01:28:46.583
So am I.

921
01:29:44.458 --> 01:29:45.625
"Rich." he said.

922
01:29:46.958 --> 01:29:48.667
"Bears." he said.

923
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:51.542
Oh. "I'm a genius." he said.

924
01:29:51.625 --> 01:29:52.625
What's going on?

925
01:29:53.208 --> 01:29:54.750
Pack your bag. we're off to Spain.

926
01:29:55.875 --> 01:29:57.875
Spain? Why?

927
01:29:57.958 --> 01:30:00.792
Remember those big. stupid. muscly men

928
01:30:00.875 --> 01:30:03.125
your idiot of a father
sold them old bangers to?

929
01:30:03.208 --> 01:30:04.333
Come on. love…

930
01:30:04.417 --> 01:30:06.583
Turns out they was the flaming Mafia!

931
01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:09.000
And not so stupid after all.

932
01:30:09.083 --> 01:30:11.667
And they gave me 24 hours
to get them the money back.

933
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:13.667
Only somebody already spent it.

934
01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:17.083
I'm getting some passports tomorrow.
So I'll pick you up from school.

935
01:30:17.167 --> 01:30:21.292
What about Mrs. Phelps.
Lavender. Nigel. Amanda?

936
01:30:21.375 --> 01:30:23.042
-What about Miss Honey?
-Forget 'em!

937
01:30:23.125 --> 01:30:25.375
After tomorrow.
you're never gonna see 'em again!

938
01:31:59.708 --> 01:32:02.708
<i> Yesterday an act</i>
<i>of vandalism took place in the woods.</i>

939
01:32:02.792 --> 01:32:04.708
<i>Now you've seen the consequences.</i>

940
01:32:04.792 --> 01:32:07.583
<i>You break my toys. I break yours.</i>

941
01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:10.208
<i>Miss Honey's class. canteen. now.</i>

942
01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:13.000
Come along. children. It'll be fine.

943
01:32:40.458 --> 01:32:41.500
Children…

944
01:32:43.125 --> 01:32:46.917
How can I be your headmistress

945
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.250
if I cannot chill you to the bone?

946
01:32:52.917 --> 01:32:53.750
Mm?

947
01:32:54.458 --> 01:32:57.958
If the small ones don't pee just a little

948
01:32:58.042 --> 01:33:00.167
when I walk into the room.
well then I'm…

949
01:33:01.042 --> 01:33:05.833
failing as an educator.

950
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:09.875
So…

951
01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:13.792
Today we are going
to have a spelling test.

952
01:33:15.458 --> 01:33:21.875
And any child who gets one
single answer wrong…

953
01:33:23.083 --> 01:33:26.542
goes to Chokey.

954
01:33:26.625 --> 01:33:28.083
You can't do that!

955
01:33:29.292 --> 01:33:30.875
Oh. really? Why?

956
01:33:30.958 --> 01:33:33.167
Because of yesterday's little…

957
01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:37.000
…incident. you mean?

958
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:40.208
Well. here's a surprise Chokey.

959
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.208
-You!

960
01:33:47.375 --> 01:33:49.042
Spell. oh. let me see…

961
01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:50.625
"newt."

962
01:33:50.708 --> 01:33:55.000
N-E-W-T. Newt.

963
01:33:56.667 --> 01:33:57.500
What?

964
01:33:58.375 --> 01:33:59.375
How do you know that?

965
01:33:59.458 --> 01:34:02.458
Miss Honey taught us.
She's very good at teaching.

966
01:34:03.917 --> 01:34:05.167
Nonsense!

967
01:34:05.250 --> 01:34:08.958
Miss Honey's far too soft and peachy

968
01:34:09.042 --> 01:34:10.792
to be good at anything!

969
01:34:10.875 --> 01:34:11.917
You!

970
01:34:12.875 --> 01:34:16.833
Spell the one thing you all are.

971
01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:19.875
Spell "revolting."

972
01:34:20.458 --> 01:34:24.333
Revolting. R-E-V-O-L-T…

973
01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.083
I-N-G. Revolting.

974
01:34:27.167 --> 01:34:29.083
You're cheating. pigtails!

975
01:34:29.167 --> 01:34:32.375
Of course she's not cheating!
She's simply spelling the word.

976
01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:34.750
I just taught them with kindness
and patience and respect.

977
01:34:34.833 --> 01:34:37.417
How dare you bring
those words into my classroom!

978
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.833
You. Snot-nose.

979
01:34:42.542 --> 01:34:43.792
Stand and spell…

980
01:34:45.417 --> 01:34:49.958
"amchellakamanialseptricolistimosis."

981
01:34:50.042 --> 01:34:51.917
But that's not even a word.

982
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.417
Spell it or go to Chokey.

983
01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.458
And I should warn you.
it has silent letters.

984
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:58.583
A…

985
01:34:59.792 --> 01:35:00.625
M…

986
01:35:01.542 --> 01:35:02.625
C…

987
01:35:03.167 --> 01:35:04.083
H…

988
01:35:05.583 --> 01:35:06.542
E…

989
01:35:08.083 --> 01:35:09.083
L…

990
01:35:09.917 --> 01:35:10.833
L…

991
01:35:12.667 --> 01:35:13.625
A…

992
01:35:15.250 --> 01:35:16.375
Oh. dear…

993
01:35:17.208 --> 01:35:18.917
-Oh…
-K…

994
01:35:19.542 --> 01:35:22.458
I'm so sorry. it was a silent V.

995
01:35:22.542 --> 01:35:24.958
-You're going to Chokey!

996
01:35:25.875 --> 01:35:26.875
Cat!

997
01:35:27.375 --> 01:35:30.583
C-A-F. Cat.

998
01:35:31.208 --> 01:35:35.583
I got it wrong. Miss.
You have to put me in Chokey. too.

999
01:35:35.667 --> 01:35:40.000
-What?
-Dog. D-Y-P. Dog. And me.

1000
01:35:40.917 --> 01:35:44.583
Table. X-A-B-F-Y. And me.

1001
01:35:44.667 --> 01:35:46.875
Can't put us all in Chokey. Banana.

1002
01:35:46.958 --> 01:35:50.917
G-T-A-A-B-L…

1003
01:35:55.125 --> 01:35:56.125
Stop this!

1004
01:36:20.125 --> 01:36:22.958
I've been busy!

1005
01:36:24.542 --> 01:36:28.708
A Chokey for each and every one of you!

1006
01:36:34.333 --> 01:36:36.333
-Get down!

1007
01:36:39.250 --> 01:36:44.125
And now our little test is over.

1008
01:36:44.708 --> 01:36:47.292
I can tell you that each

1009
01:36:47.375 --> 01:36:51.167
and every one of you has failed.

1010
01:36:52.292 --> 01:36:56.167
You see. there are winners and losers

1011
01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:58.667
in this world. children.

1012
01:36:59.583 --> 01:37:03.333
And I am a--

1013
01:37:03.417 --> 01:37:05.625
The chalk! Look. the chalk!

1014
01:37:05.708 --> 01:37:07.000
Huh?

1015
01:37:08.583 --> 01:37:10.042
"Agatha…

1016
01:37:10.583 --> 01:37:13.542
This is Magnus.

1017
01:37:14.125 --> 01:37:17.250
Give my Jenny…

1018
01:37:17.833 --> 01:37:21.500
back her house."

1019
01:37:21.583 --> 01:37:24.208
Who's doing this? Who? Tell me now.

1020
01:37:24.792 --> 01:37:26.833
No one's doing it. It's a ghost!

1021
01:37:26.917 --> 01:37:29.667
"Then leave."

1022
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:30.875
Oh. no.

1023
01:37:30.958 --> 01:37:34.042
"Or I will…

1024
01:37:34.125 --> 01:37:36.458
get you…

1025
01:37:36.542 --> 01:37:38.875
like you…

1026
01:37:38.958 --> 01:37:41.000
got me!"

1027
01:37:43.458 --> 01:37:44.875
You think me an idiot!

1028
01:37:45.708 --> 01:37:49.542
It's a cheap trick
just like Magnus used to do!

1029
01:37:51.833 --> 01:37:53.708
You can't hurt me.

1030
01:37:54.292 --> 01:37:55.542
I hurt you!

1031
01:37:55.625 --> 01:37:56.500
No!

1032
01:37:58.333 --> 01:37:59.333
No.

1033
01:38:17.375 --> 01:38:18.708
Oh!

1034
01:38:25.083 --> 01:38:27.125
It can't be Magnus. It can't.

1035
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:32.667
Look! Matilda.

1036
01:39:03.458 --> 01:39:07.667
You see! I'm not going anywhere!

1037
01:39:12.417 --> 01:39:14.667
Oh. no. Stop.

1038
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:16.958
I say. what are you doing to my hair?

1039
01:39:18.375 --> 01:39:21.250
Pigtails! No!

1040
01:39:21.333 --> 01:39:22.333
No!

1041
01:39:23.667 --> 01:39:26.208
I hate pigtails!

1042
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.625
Stop it now! I'm ordering you!

1043
01:39:36.167 --> 01:39:38.667
Let me down! Let me down!

1044
01:39:39.625 --> 01:39:40.583
Let me down!

1045
01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:07.500
It's over.

1046
01:40:08.083 --> 01:40:09.500
This is my school now.

1047
01:40:13.917 --> 01:40:14.958
Run.

1048
01:41:06.667 --> 01:41:07.708
-Yes!

1049
01:43:24.875 --> 01:43:25.708
Come on!

1050
01:43:26.417 --> 01:43:28.083
We've got to go. boy.
We're going to be late!

1051
01:43:28.167 --> 01:43:30.542
She's a-- Sorry. go?

1052
01:43:30.625 --> 01:43:32.167
Spain. We're moving there.

1053
01:43:32.250 --> 01:43:33.917
We've got a plane to catch in 40 minutes.

1054
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.250
Oi! Say your goodbyes now!

1055
01:43:37.333 --> 01:43:38.917
No. Matilda. You can't.

1056
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.125
-No way.
-Don't leave us.

1057
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:44.792
It's not up to me.

1058
01:43:57.875 --> 01:43:59.083
Thank you.

1059
01:44:03.625 --> 01:44:04.500
Come on.

1060
01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.208
Chop flaming chop.

1061
01:44:09.125 --> 01:44:10.833
Right. In you go.

1062
01:44:10.917 --> 01:44:12.167
Where do I go?

1063
01:44:12.250 --> 01:44:14.792
It can go in the back. Harry.
It's got them clingy fingers.

1064
01:44:14.875 --> 01:44:17.000
What. you can't just stick him
in the back.

1065
01:44:17.083 --> 01:44:18.417
Let Matilda stay here with me.

1066
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Mr. Wormwood.
I would love to take Matilda.

1067
01:44:24.083 --> 01:44:25.500
I beg your pardon?

1068
01:44:25.583 --> 01:44:28.125
If she'd like to stay with me. that is.

1069
01:44:28.208 --> 01:44:33.042
I would look after her with love
and respect and care and…

1070
01:44:34.667 --> 01:44:36.333
I'd pay for everything.

1071
01:44:38.375 --> 01:44:40.042
Would you like that. Matilda?

1072
01:44:41.333 --> 01:44:42.708
-Hang on!
-Harry!

1073
01:44:43.708 --> 01:44:46.708
You want us to leave our daughter
here with you?

1074
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.625
What did you just call me?

1075
01:44:50.708 --> 01:44:52.875
We are going to miss the plane!

1076
01:44:52.958 --> 01:44:56.542
Did you just call me… your daughter?

1077
01:44:57.250 --> 01:44:59.667
If… if that's what she wants.

1078
01:45:03.667 --> 01:45:06.208
Well? Is that what you want?

1079
01:45:06.792 --> 01:45:09.375
You want to…
stay here with Miss Honey?

1080
01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:11.417
Yes.

1081
01:45:14.292 --> 01:45:16.250
Yes. I… yes. I do.

1082
01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:21.083
And you want to look after her?

1083
01:45:22.458 --> 01:45:23.917
I do. Yes.

1084
01:45:31.125 --> 01:45:32.625
We are a bit short of room.

1085
01:45:34.625 --> 01:45:35.583
Yeah.

1086
01:45:36.208 --> 01:45:37.417
Yeah. all right.

1087
01:45:38.417 --> 01:45:39.500
Yeah.

1088
01:45:46.542 --> 01:45:47.542
Thank you.

1089
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Harry!

1090
01:46:13.292 --> 01:46:15.375
Please!

1091
01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:19.667
She did it.

1092
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:21.625
-Lovely. right.

1093
01:46:32.708 --> 01:46:35.167
-Hip. hip!
-Hooray!

1094
01:46:35.250 --> 01:46:37.833
-Hip. hip!
-Hooray!

1095
01:46:37.917 --> 01:46:41.292
-Hip. hip!
-Hooray!

1096
01:48:36.833 --> 01:48:40.917
-Careful. Left a bit. Left a bit.

1097
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.625
-Perfect!
