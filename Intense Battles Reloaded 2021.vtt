161
00:26:36.955 --> 00:26:43.324
don't worry i'll see you again. You be careful. Take care.

162
00:26:59.263 --> 00:27:00.329
Everything okay?

163
00:27:04.836 --> 00:27:06.338
what happened

164
00:27:08.256 --> 00:27:15.354
He's just like his father. Ah Walter. That's
a good thing.

165
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:24.635
Listen you don't have anything to worry about
everything is going to be just fine we're

166
00:27:24.635 --> 00:27:33.457
going to get the guys who did this. I don't
trust me I know

167
00:27:37.623 --> 00:27:44.550
It's gonna be okay. I remember him when he
was a little boy he was a fine little boy

168
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:50.995
then now he's a grown man he's older now you
know he has to make his own decisions live

169
00:27:50.995 --> 00:28:06.057
his own life. So it's okay. Guess what? What?
I saw the face of the guy who did that. It

170
00:28:06.057 --> 00:28:10.298
led me to Walter... I know what he looks like.

171
00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:23.500
I've got his face etched in my mind. So like
said it'll be fine don't worry it's okay.

172
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.354
It'll be okay.

173
00:28:25.279 --> 00:28:26.527
It'll be okay.

174
00:28:37.318 --> 00:28:38.274
Tommy?

175
00:28:38.737 --> 00:28:40.428
Hey Elia you need to get home right now!

176
00:28:40.957 --> 00:28:41.916

Is everything okay officers? Not officers FBI. We were dispatched here by the bureau due

215
00:39:03.599 --> 00:39:08.109
to a possible home invasion that occurred
here. well there wasn't any home invasion

216
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:14.509
at this house... You're at the wrong house It is all right if we take a look inside? yeah

217
00:39:14.509 --> 00:39:16.430
Yeah yeah sure come in.

218
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.253
Is this door closed? That's my roommates room he is out of town

219
00:39:45.667 --> 00:39:58.640
Do you mind just stay still it makes me a
little nervous thank you. Nobody else live

220
00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:04.609
with you beside your roommate? No nobody else just some family upstairs. Finish searching

221
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:08.748
down here while I go check upstairs if you
don't mind? That's alright.

222
00:40:34.248 --> 00:40:40.339
So sorry for the inconvenience you know we had the phone call. We had to come to check

223
00:40:40.339 --> 00:40:47.619
it out so I hope you have a good day. You too. Thank you and apologize for any inconvenience.

224
00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:48.446
No problem.

225
00:40:55.042 --> 00:41:04.609
What do you think? Nothing... the house was clean.
we checked it out. no signs of struggle. Nothing

226
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:10.970
like an altercation happened that would indicate there was a home invasion. Well Mark what the

227
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:17.880
Bureau gonna say now? The deputy won't be so happy we come back with empty hands. Fuck them

228
00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:23.400
we tell them the truth. We didn't find anything... that we're empty-handed so they'll have to

229
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.084
deal with it.

230
00:41:38.259 --> 00:41:51.598
I think we need to keep a closer eye on this guy though he gave me bad vibes... see what i'm

231
00:41:51.598 --> 00:41:54.953
talking about. Wow he just check us from the window.

232
00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:11.410
Do you think the bureau hired some extra people to help you with this type of case? Like yourself?

233
00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:17.420
Huh... what about the new guy what's his name... Luke. Is he any good? I've seen him around. I

234
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:21.739
don't know him I haven't worked with him yet... but actually he has been assigned to this

235
00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:26.479
case. So later this week I get to meet him
and work with him He has to check some locations

236
00:42:26.479 --> 00:42:29.860
out for me going forward we'll see how he
works out. Sounds good... Sounds good.

237
00:44:56.753 --> 00:45:02.604
So for your first assignment today together...
Mark and Luke I need you two to check this house

238
00:45:02.604 --> 00:45:06.542
and find out what's going on. There have been reports of drug activity in this house and

239
00:45:06.542 --> 00:45:09.520
if you find out any useful information I need you to report it back to the bureau

240
00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.020
immediately.

241
00:47:39.059 --> 00:47:45.769
we'll take a few surveillance photos of this
guy i don't understand what he's doing

242
00:47:45.769 --> 00:47:48.650
going to the trunk for something

243
00:48:16.502 --> 00:48:23.650
he's got a black bag. It's look like a body
for me... What you think? Definitely looks like

244
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:27.500
a body. So do you think we should move in on him now?

245
00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:30.781
let's follow him

246
00:48:55.449 --> 00:48:57.484
should I take the shotgun?

247
00:49:41.336 --> 00:49:47.895
You think we should be going in on him now? No we wait until
he gets to his final destination then we stop him.

248
00:50:37.157 --> 00:50:39.478
supposed to be where he goes who knows?

249
00:50:39.478 --> 00:50:41.895
I don't fucking like this place... Come on then.

250
00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:06.569
Who are you?

251
00:51:06.569 --> 00:51:08.788
You think you're in a position to ask any questions?

252
00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:15.973
listen you don't have to do this... down!

253
00:52:14.195 --> 00:52:15.694
play time is over

254
00:52:54.542 --> 00:52:55.989
You like that huh?

255
00:53:07.365 --> 00:53:09.519
I will take you out one way or another...

256
00:53:16.888 --> 00:53:18.406
Give your best shot.

257
00:53:50.182 --> 00:53:52.438

258
00:54:10.559 --> 00:54:12.240
you're going down

259
00:54:14.026 --> 00:54:15.629

260
00:54:15.629 --> 00:54:18.466
I'm going to deliver you to the maker...

261
00:54:19.326 --> 00:54:20.942
One thing you're missing though...

262
00:54:21.272 --> 00:54:22.405
What's that?

263
00:54:23.405 --> 00:54:25.360

264
00:54:38.239 --> 00:54:40.157

what it's like

331
01:04:22.729 --> 01:04:30.673
to be able to see your mother on the floor
in the house

332
01:04:30.673 --> 01:04:38.469

the furniture and here you are you're a kid

feel like nobody loves me nobody gives a damn
about me except my best friend and it's just

it's very tragic

343
01:05:45.953 --> 01:05:50.460
it's very tragic when I have to do things
out of my own free will that I was forced

344
01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:57.099
to do because I had no other fucking choice
because I don't have a father to love but

345
01:05:57.099 --> 01:06:01.469
I have a father I can look up to I don't have
a father to be able to guide me to

346
01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:07.541
to simply do what's right in front of everybody's
eyes

397
01:16:22.261 --> 01:16:27.742
And how am I supposed to do that? Create the contract... Allow him to sign it without him even knowing

01:16:27.742 --> 01:16:33.424
that he's signing his life away. He's never
going to receive the money because he'll be dead!
