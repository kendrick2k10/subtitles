- Yeah.

198
00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:14.626

a sense of responsibility

199

to be the guardian at the gate
and to not let things through

200
00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:22.125

for three months

<i>You started on May 15th

1553
01:14:21.626 --> 01:14:23.918
Did you ever meet one-on-one
with Donald Trump

1554
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.459
and have a conversation
with him?

1555
01:14:27.334 --> 01:14:29.125
- We met many times.
but never one-on-one.

1556
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:31.209
- Can you remember
anything that was said

1557
01:14:31.292 --> 01:14:34.083
at any of those
that sticks in your mind?

1558
01:14:36.334 --> 01:14:38.250
- I can.
<i>- [laughs]</i>

1559
01:14:38.334 --> 01:14:41.167
Tell me.
<i>- [laughs]</i>

1560

<i>We were in the Oval Office.
Happened twice.</i>

1561
01:14:43.125 --> 01:14:44.709
Twice.

1562
01:14:44.792 --> 01:14:47.375
And he would.
at some moment. do this.

1563
01:14:50.542 --> 01:14:53.584
"It's oval here.
This is the Oval Office.

1564
01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:55.334
I'm the president."

1565
01:14:55.417 --> 01:14:57.500
- He would just say that
out of the blue?

1566
01:14:57.584 --> 01:14:59.667
- Out of the blue. I swear.
and. like. honestly.

1567
01:14:59.751 --> 01:15:01.125
the first time.
I was like. "Oh. my God."

1568
01:15:01.209 --> 01:15:03.167
- Did he ever confront you
and say.

1569
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:05.834
"You're a Democrat.
You didn't vote for me.

1570
01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:08.584
Are you--are you working

1571
01:15:08.667 --> 01:15:11.751
He never got in your face?
<i>- Absolutely not.</i>

1572
01:15:11.834 --> 01:15:15.584
And frankly. Jon. my preference

1573
01:15:15.667 --> 01:15:18.918
is. even after the fact.
not to politicize this.

1574
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.667
I worked so hard
to stay out of any politics.

1575
01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:23.918
- You have a sense
that you accomplished

1576
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.375
what you set out to do.

1577
01:15:26.459 --> 01:15:28.626
- Honestly. yesterday.
I was surprised.

1578
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:30.417
We got an email saying.
"As of tomorrow.

1579
01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:34.042
you cannot use the word
Operation Warp Speed anymore."

1580
01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:35.959
I told myself...

1581
01:15:37.918 --> 01:15:40.250
"Why? What's the added value?"

1582
01:15:40.334 --> 01:15:42.542
Because. in a way.
everybody that's worked

1583
01:15:42.626 --> 01:15:44.250
under Operation Warp Speed.
it feels like.

1584
01:15:44.334 --> 01:15:46.834
"What did we do wrong?"
- Yeah.

1585
01:15:46.918 --> 01:15:48.334
<i>- Why?</i>

1586
01:15:48.417 --> 01:15:50.167
And I'm not married
to that name.

1587
01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.459
Frankly. I don't care.

1588
01:15:51.542 --> 01:15:53.751
Honestly. I feel...

1589
01:15:55.542 --> 01:15:58.667
I feel so fortunate and happy

1590
01:15:58.751 --> 01:16:00.959

1591
01:16:01.042 --> 01:16:02.250
That's all that counts.

1592
01:16:02.334 --> 01:16:07.292
I say two vaccines approved--
by all standards.

1593
01:16:07.375 --> 01:16:10.417
this is absolutely exceptional.

1594
01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:11.792
Absolutely exceptional.

1595
01:16:11.876 --> 01:16:13.626

01:16:23.667 --> 01:16:25.751
There is still
a lot to be done.

1601
01:16:25.834 --> 01:16:29.042
- Do you think that Trump's
failure to concede

1602
01:16:29.125 --> 01:16:32.500
and refusal to concede
made it more difficult

1603
01:16:32.584 --> 01:16:35.792
to transition the information
to the next team?

1604
01:16:35.876 --> 01:16:38.000
- For sure.

1605
01:16:38.083 --> 01:16:41.542
Very. at least. unfortunate.
Polite word.

1606
01:16:41.626 --> 01:16:42.834

<i>- You know. I look forward--
