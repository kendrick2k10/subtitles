00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.100
<i>It's said</i>
<i>that mother is the name for God</i>

4
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.833
<i>on the lips and hearts of all children.</i>

5
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.433
<i>She can be glorious or terrible.</i>

6
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.733
<i>benevolent or filled with wrath.</i>

7
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.133
<i>She'll fight away the monsters</i>

8
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.300
<i>with the fangs of a wolf</i>
<i>and the teeth of a dragon.</i>

9
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.300
<i>And love with a ferocity</i>
<i>that can never be matched.</i>

10
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.700
<i>Her job is to protect.</i>

11
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.400
<i>No matter the cost.</i>

12
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.300
<i>And if anyone</i>
<i>were to ever harm her family.</i>

13
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.133
<i>there's no telling</i>
<i>what she'd be capable of.</i>

14
00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:53.033
Sounds really nasty out there.

15
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.000
Yeah. I think we're in for a rough one.

16
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.233
How are you getting on with that?

17
00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:03.066
Can't rush a masterpiece.

18
00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:04.433
No.

19
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.233
He's gonna love it.

20
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:08.066
Hands off.

21
00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:14.133
Best one you've ever done.

22
00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:17.400
That's so beautiful. darling.

23
00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:21.700
I love it.

24
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.900
Let's go. Picasso.

25
00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.400
Is he awake?

26
00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:37.966
Happy birthday. Pa.

27
00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:41.800
Happy birthday.

28
00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.633
-Can I open it?
-Yes. go on.

29
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.733
Look what mama made for you.

30
00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.100
It's beautiful.

31
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.666
Picture time.

32
00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:02.800
Big grin!

33
00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:10.933
How about I let you stay up
a little later?

34
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.433
We'll cozy up and listen to the storm.
It'll be fun.

35
00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:17.266
Yes. Mama. Thank you.

36
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.533
Here we go.

37
00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:29.966
First the medicine. then the cake.

38
00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:35.766
Here we are.

39
00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:43.333
It goes by so fast.

40
00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:49.400
Hello! Anybody? Anybody. help!
Please open the door!

41
00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:53.700
Please! Please. help me! We need help!

42
00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:55.433
Who's there?

43
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.500
Hello?

44
00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:58.666
My brother. he's really hurt.

45
00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:01.900
-He's hurt. please!
-What are you doing out here?

46
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.866
We got lost. and we came off the road.
and there was an accident.

47
00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.700
My brother is bleeding really badly.

48
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.933
-We have to help them. Mama.
-Maisy. get back. please.

49
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.200
I can't help you. There's no phone here.

50
00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:19.900
Please. Please. don't let him die.
Don't let him die! Don't let him die!

51
00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:22.966
Please. please. Don't let him...
Help us. please.

52
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.466
He's bleeding so badly. Please.
Please. don't let him die.

53
00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.633
Please. don't let him die.
Please. don't let him die.

54
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.166
Don't let him die. Don't let him...
Please. just don't let him...

55
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.700
Where is he hurt?

56
00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:42.433
I don't know. I think his head maybe.

57
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.033
But there's blood everywhere. I just...

58
00:04:57.066 --> 00:04:58.866
Just stop. Stop it.

59
00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:01.633
Is he gonna be okay?
Can you do anything?

60
00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:04.366
Well. there's a deep cut to his head.

61
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.733
His ribs may be broken.

62
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.933
There might be

63
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.866
some internal bleeding.

64
00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:16.666
If I pull this straight out. it'll cause
more damage than when it went in.

65
00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:18.833
He needs to go to a hospital.

66
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.166
-The closest one is 100 miles away.
-No. no.

67
00:05:21.233 --> 00:05:24.166
-And you won't get there like this.
-No. I'm not going back!

68
00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:27.866
I'm not going back there.
What can you do?

69
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.533
I need to stitch him up
or he'll bleed to death.

70
00:05:44.566 --> 00:05:47.333
Now. everything's gonna be all right.

71
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.400
But I need you to give me
some space now.

72
00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:51.833
So back up. back up.

73
00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:53.166
All right.

74
00:06:01.533 --> 00:06:03.833
Right. Right.

75
00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:08.533
Just...

76
00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:14.033
You hold it tight.

77
00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:21.033
-You okay. baby?
-Yeah. fine.

78
00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:23.433
God. God...

79
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.200
When I pull it out on three.

80
00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:30.966
you have to apply extra pressure.

81
00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:32.033
-Ready?
-Yeah.

82
00:06:32.466 --> 00:06:35.533
One... two... three.

83
00:06:43.366 --> 00:06:45.000
-You okay. baby?
-Yeah.

84
00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:49.533
All right.

85
00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:06.700
What's your name. darling?

86
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.633
Matty. My name's Matty.

87
00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:14.233
Well. I'm Rose.
And this is my daughter. Maisy.

88
00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:15.800
-Hello.
-Hi.

89
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.800
Maisy. why don't you get Matty
a towel and some of Pa's clothes?

90
00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:22.866
Yes. Mama.

91
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.900
He's gonna be all right.

92
00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:38.833
He just needs to have some rest now.

93
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.500
Hey.

94
00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:49.066
Trust me.

95
00:07:53.433 --> 00:07:54.433
Go on.

96
00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:30.666
No...

97
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.833
I don't fear the fire.
because I am the fire.

98
00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:51.766
Come and sit down. darling.

99
00:09:52.666 --> 00:09:55.333
Maisy's made some stew.
and I've made some coffee.

100
00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:57.000
Do you drink coffee?

101
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.400
Yeah.

102
00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:02.200
Thanks for helping.

103
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.600
I thought...

104
00:10:05.033 --> 00:10:08.800
It's all right. Really. You're safe now.

105
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.366
Can you tell me what happened to you?

106
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:20.900
It was dark. There was lots of rain.
I couldn't see anything.

107
00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:23.966
You came off the road. Where?

108
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:25.866
A long way back.

109
00:10:28.266 --> 00:10:31.300
I kept walking. But there was nothing.
it was just fields.

110
00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:33.966
Lots of mud.

111
00:10:35.933 --> 00:10:37.666
Go ahead. Eat.

112
00:10:47.533 --> 00:10:48.533
Hungry?

113
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.500
Yeah. I am. Yeah.

114
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.433
But where are you from? You talk funny.

115
00:10:56.133 --> 00:10:58.033
Maisy. the coffee.

116
00:11:02.833 --> 00:11:04.100
Where are you headed?

117
00:11:05.033 --> 00:11:08.433
Me and Jack's friend.
We're going on a boat. Fast one.

118
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
A boat?

119
00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:12.166
So. where is that?

120
00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:17.966
I don't know.

121
00:11:18.933 --> 00:11:20.466
Don't know where you're going?

122
00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:25.133
I can't remember.

123
00:11:26.633 --> 00:11:30.600
That's all right.
How about where are you coming from?

124
00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:35.233
London.

125
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.366
Maisy. let's clear the plates.

126
00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:42.000
Now. it's bedtime.

127
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.700
-But... Mama...
-Mama? What?

128
00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:48.166
Yes. Mama.

129
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.633
Where are you going on the boat?

130
00:12:01.766 --> 00:12:03.866
-We're going fishing. Right. buddy?
-Jack!

131
00:12:08.766 --> 00:12:10.000
How are you feeling?

132
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.133
Like I've been in a car wreck.

133
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.266
Come. sit. Sit down.

134
00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:15.566
Water?

135
00:12:16.633 --> 00:12:17.766
Yeah. thank you.

136
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.266
Have you got anything stronger?

137
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.300
I have to thank you
for sorting this out?

138
00:12:43.933 --> 00:12:46.000
She popped you straight free
like a kebab.

139
00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:49.566
Well. I tried to clean you up
as best I could.

140
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.366
But you'll need
someone to take a proper look.

141
00:12:52.433 --> 00:12:56.433
But the best that I can offer you
is Tramadol.

142
00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:00.933
This is neat work.

143
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.066
Not my first time
with a needle and thread.

144
00:13:03.266 --> 00:13:04.500
Yeah. I can see that.

145
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.333
Well. thanks all the same.

146
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.066
It's him you should be thanking.

147
00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:13.633
Hey.

148
00:13:14.633 --> 00:13:16.000
You've done real good. bud.

149
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.166
-Is it just the three of you?
-That's right.

150
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.066
We've got people waiting on us.

151
00:13:30.533 --> 00:13:33.233
They need to know we're okay
and come pick us up.

152
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.833
No. no.
You won't get any reception here.

153
00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:37.933
Not until that storm passes.

154
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.766
They don't have a phone either.

155
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.933
No phone. no TV. no computer.

156
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.866
It's a working farm.
We don't have any use for it.

157
00:13:45.566 --> 00:13:47.566
No. Mama. I was just saying.

158
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.766
We're self-sufficient.

159
00:13:50.166 --> 00:13:55.000
We sell or trade what we don't use
for what we need at the market.

160
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.466
It's a choice.

161
00:13:58.233 --> 00:14:00.633
But it works for us. doesn't it. Maisy?

162
00:14:01.033 --> 00:14:02.033
Yes. Mama.

163
00:14:03.033 --> 00:14:06.433
There is an old hardline phone box
on the road to the village.

164
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.033
It may still be working.

165
00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:10.233
I could take you there in the morning.

166
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.300
I appreciate that.
but we need to make that call tonight.

167
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.133
There's nothing I can do.

168
00:14:17.033 --> 00:14:18.733
Do you think Mac will come for us?

169
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.700
I guess we'll see. won't we?

170
00:14:22.866 --> 00:14:27.166
You could take Pa's room for the night.
be on your way in the morning.

171
00:14:30.133 --> 00:14:31.300
That's very kind.

172
00:14:31.633 --> 00:14:33.133
If you want to get cleaned up.

173
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.766
-we can show you the bathroom.
-I know where it is.

174
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.633
Come on then.

175
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
This way.

176
00:14:55.466 --> 00:14:56.600
Did you tidy up?

177
00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:12.166
Come on.

178
00:15:52.766 --> 00:15:53.766
Fuck.

179
00:15:57.133 --> 00:15:58.466
Jack. are you okay?

180
00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:08.700
Where's the other bag. mate?

181
00:16:09.133 --> 00:16:10.133
What?

182
00:16:10.266 --> 00:16:11.700
This is the only bag we have.

183
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.500
Tell me.

184
00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:16.433
We have to steal the bag.

185
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.766
You're hurting me.

186
00:16:18.866 --> 00:16:21.366
Stop it. Don't make a fucking scene.

187
00:16:23.833 --> 00:16:25.800
You can't do this to me right now. bud.

188
00:16:26.766 --> 00:16:27.900
Please.

189
00:16:30.266 --> 00:16:31.500
I don't feel the fire.

190
00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:33.633
I don't feel the fire.

191
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.366
Because I am the fire.

192
00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:36.433
That's right.

193
00:16:37.466 --> 00:16:39.833
You burn and I burn.

194
00:16:42.133 --> 00:16:44.066
If we don't have the bag. we're fucked.

195
00:16:44.866 --> 00:16:46.400
Nothing else worth it matters.

196
00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:48.533
I must have taken the wrong one.

197
00:16:49.533 --> 00:16:52.866
-Get off me. Get...
-It's okay. It's okay.

198
00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:56.600
Is it still in the car?

199
00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.600
Are you sure?

200
00:17:00.733 --> 00:17:01.733
I think so.

201
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200
It is. yeah.

202
00:17:06.166 --> 00:17:08.033
Okay. Okay.

203
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.933
Now.
what else did you tell these people?

204
00:17:15.833 --> 00:17:18.200
You gave them our names.
What else do they know?

205
00:17:18.533 --> 00:17:19.533
Nothing.

206
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.100
Nothing?

207
00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:22.500
Yeah. I swear.

208
00:17:23.233 --> 00:17:24.233
All right.

209
00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:25.633
Come here.

210
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.366
What the fuck do we do now?

211
00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:41.366
We need to get back to that car.

212
00:17:55.233 --> 00:17:56.933
I know what's best for you. right?

213
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Yeah.

214
00:18:02.366 --> 00:18:04.833
You won't like
what you've made me do now.

215
00:18:06.733 --> 00:18:08.233
You haven't given me a choice.

216
00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:19.500
Why would you come here
if you were headed to the coast?

217
00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:20.900
You wouldn't. baby.

218
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.000
Unless you were lost. I guess.

219
00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:24.600
Or didn't want to be found.

220
00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:27.500
No!

221
00:18:29.633 --> 00:18:30.733
What are you doing?

222
00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:33.833
-No! No!
-Stop!

223
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.500
-Stop it! Stop it!
-What's going on?

224
00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:42.666
All of Matty's stuff. his notebooks.
they're still in the car.

225
00:18:42.733 --> 00:18:46.166
-I have a notebook he can have.
-Dad gave me that notebook.

226
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.066
Will he be okay?

227
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.366
Well. this ain't gonna stop
until he gets his stuff back. okay?

228
00:18:52.533 --> 00:18:55.833
So you can either help me do that.
or you can watch this happen.

229
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.900
I can't give you my truck.
And the roads are too dangerous.

230
00:18:58.966 --> 00:18:59.966
I'm sorry.

231
00:19:02.866 --> 00:19:05.100
Great! Nice one. mate!

232
00:19:08.133 --> 00:19:10.400
No!

233
00:19:14.666 --> 00:19:15.666
We have money.

234
00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:20.566
We don't need your money.
And you can't buy my help.

235
00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:23.866
Matty. darling.

236
00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:27.866
Now. come here. sweetheart.

237
00:19:28.366 --> 00:19:29.366
Listen...

238
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.200
Now.
I understand that you're frustrated.

239
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.533
Your things are special to you.

240
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.600
I just want him
to give them to me. please.

241
00:19:40.666 --> 00:19:42.133
Just give me...

242
00:19:42.633 --> 00:19:44.966
And I want to help you to get them back.

243
00:19:45.366 --> 00:19:49.200
But can you help me
by doing a few deep breaths?

244
00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:53.133
Come on.

245
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.666
We need to be quick.

246
00:20:08.133 --> 00:20:10.966
My husband is
on a strict schedule of medication.

247
00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:13.333
and I don't want that to be disrupted.

248
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.966
Shall we go and get your face washed up?

249
00:20:20.533 --> 00:20:22.733
Come on. Come on.

250
00:20:24.133 --> 00:20:25.133
Come on.

251
00:20:40.766 --> 00:20:42.233
That's my brother. Ollie.

252
00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:45.000
He died
the same time Pa had his accident.

253
00:20:45.966 --> 00:20:47.600
I was too young to remember him.

254
00:20:48.933 --> 00:20:50.133
You think that's bad?

255
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.400
No.

256
00:20:55.933 --> 00:20:57.533
Sometimes. it's better that way.

257
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.433
It's going to be all right.

258
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.766
Please. you promised.

259
00:21:25.566 --> 00:21:27.100
Hold my satchel. yeah?

260
00:21:31.733 --> 00:21:33.366
You're not gonna leave me again.

261
00:21:34.733 --> 00:21:35.733
I never...

262
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.800
Close your eyes. Go to sleep.

263
00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:42.300
This is good people.

264
00:21:44.066 --> 00:21:45.233
What was she like?

265
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.200
-Bud. we don't have time for this.
-No. please. please. It helps me sleep.

266
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.666
She was pretty.

267
00:21:59.866 --> 00:22:01.133
And soft-skinned.

268
00:22:02.366 --> 00:22:05.200
She made a funny face
when she was thinking. like you do.

269
00:22:08.133 --> 00:22:09.433
I see a lot of her in you.

270
00:22:11.566 --> 00:22:12.766
And she loved us.

271
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.100
Sure.

272
00:22:38.966 --> 00:22:40.366
Hold up. What are you doing?

273
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.400
If he's staying here.
he's staying in there.

274
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.133
I'm not leaving my daughter alone
with a man I don't know.

275
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.133
He's calmed down. There's no problem.

276
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.033
He seems like a nice boy.

277
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.866
but if you want my help.
this is non-negotiable.

278
00:22:55.466 --> 00:22:56.966
Well. he's not a dog. is he?

279
00:23:02.833 --> 00:23:03.833
Okay.

280
00:23:04.733 --> 00:23:07.633
Now. I'm trusting you
to be in charge when I'm gone.

281
00:23:07.866 --> 00:23:11.033
And if I'm not back by 10 pm.
you give Pa his medication.

282
00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:13.100
-Yes. Mama.
-Okay.

283
00:23:13.366 --> 00:23:18.400
Now. unless the house is falling down.
his room stays locked. I mean it.

284
00:23:23.466 --> 00:23:25.000
-I love you.
-I love you. too.

285
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.166
What's someone like you here
playing shepherdess.

286
00:24:14.966 --> 00:24:15.966
Excuse me?

287
00:24:16.466 --> 00:24:17.733
You're a nurse. right?

288
00:24:19.266 --> 00:24:21.833
I figured you didn't learn
how to do this on a farm.

289
00:24:24.366 --> 00:24:25.933
Anaesthetist actually.

290
00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:29.700
The way you were with Matty...

291
00:24:31.566 --> 00:24:32.733
I've seen that before.

292
00:24:35.666 --> 00:24:37.466
The fucking odds on that. though.

293
00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:39.066
And I get

294
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.100
skewered in the ass out of nowhere.

295
00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:46.666
Somehow.
Matty finds a doctor's front door.

296
00:24:51.233 --> 00:24:53.066
It was a long time ago.

297
00:24:54.866 --> 00:24:55.866
Another life.

298
00:24:58.366 --> 00:24:59.533
That must be tough.

299
00:25:02.933 --> 00:25:05.833
You're running a farm.
Living off the land. raising a kid.

300
00:25:06.566 --> 00:25:08.566
-all on your own.
-I'm not on my own.

301
00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:12.766
See. now. I didn't mean it like that.

302
00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:14.900
-I wasn't trying to say...
-No. it's fine.

303
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.966
And it's not tough
when you know what matters.

304
00:25:31.833 --> 00:25:33.300
So you're an idealist.

305
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.500
I just know loss.

306
00:25:39.833 --> 00:25:40.966
You lost your boy.

307
00:25:46.866 --> 00:25:49.866
They called it "no-fault accident."

308
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.000
That's bullshit.

309
00:25:52.833 --> 00:25:54.733
It's always someone's fault. isn't it?

310
00:25:57.933 --> 00:25:59.733
He wasn't an easy boy.

311
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.566
but he was my blessing.

312
00:26:06.533 --> 00:26:07.533
And you?

313
00:26:09.733 --> 00:26:10.733
Anyone else?

314
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.500
No one else. It's just...

315
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.500
It's just us.

316
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.500
Matty?

317
00:26:37.833 --> 00:26:38.833
Yeah?

318
00:26:40.133 --> 00:26:41.133
Are you okay?

319
00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:43.433
Did he tell you to check up on me?

320
00:26:43.866 --> 00:26:46.566
-Well. no. no. I...
-I'm not stupid.

321
00:26:46.833 --> 00:26:47.933
No. I know.

322
00:26:48.966 --> 00:26:50.766
I just wanted to talk to you.

323
00:26:52.633 --> 00:26:53.966
Do you want to talk to me?

324
00:26:58.433 --> 00:27:00.166
About what?

325
00:27:01.466 --> 00:27:02.466
I don't know.

326
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.400
I've never really talked
to anyone before. Except Mama.

327
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.333
She's the only person I know.

328
00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:13.500
Well. you're lucky.

329
00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:17.966
I don't remember my mom.
She got sick after I was born.

330
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.433
It's okay. Don't worry about that.

331
00:28:08.233 --> 00:28:10.300
I can't believe
you walked away from this.

332
00:28:10.733 --> 00:28:11.733
Are you okay?

333
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.666
Yeah. I'm fine.

334
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
All right. I'm going in. Wait here.

335
00:28:32.933 --> 00:28:35.100
No. no! I'm good. I'm good. Come on.

336
00:28:42.933 --> 00:28:45.366
So how about you? Where do you live?

337
00:28:45.766 --> 00:28:48.566
Is it a big apartment block or a house?

338
00:28:50.566 --> 00:28:52.933
I don't know.
I never lived anywhere properly.

339
00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:56.600
Jack says
all we have is what we're going after.

340
00:28:58.433 --> 00:29:01.566
If that's true.
then you never really have anything.

341
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:03.900
I don't know.

342
00:29:11.066 --> 00:29:12.533
I wish you hadn't seen that.

343
00:29:13.033 --> 00:29:14.033
Seen what?

344
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.400
I wanted this to go smooth.
It still can. Or it can go another way.

345
00:29:17.466 --> 00:29:20.100
-I don't understand.
-You're in this now. okay?

346
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.533
Whatever you think that I saw. I didn't.

347
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.633
-Yeah? Are you done?
-I don't know you...

348
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.766
You'll take me
to that phone box right now.

349
00:29:32.733 --> 00:29:33.733
Fuck!

350
00:29:35.966 --> 00:29:39.000
He wanted me to stay
in this institution. but I hated it.

351
00:29:40.333 --> 00:29:41.466
That's why we left.

352
00:29:42.733 --> 00:29:46.466
He said that when we get to Norway.
then we'll stop moving.

353
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.233
Plant some roots.

354
00:29:50.266 --> 00:29:51.666
I want somewhere like this.

355
00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:54.966
What else is up there?

356
00:29:55.666 --> 00:29:57.300
Mama's room. mine too.

357
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.033
Can I see it?

358
00:30:01.066 --> 00:30:02.233
What's through here?

359
00:30:03.733 --> 00:30:06.600
That's Mama's workshop.
No one's allowed up there.

360
00:30:08.833 --> 00:30:10.533
The place would be like Fort Knox.

361
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.233
Mama doesn't like to keep an open house.

362
00:30:18.466 --> 00:30:20.700
Mama doesn't know everything. Come on.

363
00:30:21.433 --> 00:30:23.433
I'll show you something. You'll like it.

364
00:30:23.866 --> 00:30:24.866
Okay.

365
00:30:35.566 --> 00:30:37.233
You're scared. I understand.

366
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.300
I'm not scared.

367
00:30:47.066 --> 00:30:49.633
I have done
some horrible fucking things.

368
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.466
Things that you can't imagine.

369
00:30:53.966 --> 00:30:55.733
You don't know my life.

370
00:31:09.166 --> 00:31:10.166
Come on.

371
00:31:27.566 --> 00:31:30.633
I like to imagine the voices and songs
but just for me.

372
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.100
Is that weird?

373
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.933
-No.
-You won't tell Mama. right?

374
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.200
No.

375
00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:42.633
Look.

376
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.100
Norway.

377
00:31:49.433 --> 00:31:50.866
You visited all these places?

378
00:31:51.433 --> 00:31:52.433
No.

379
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.700
No. I wish.
They're just places I like the names of.

380
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.166
<i>Who is this</i>
<i>and how did you get this number?</i>

381
00:32:33.233 --> 00:32:34.233
It's JB.

382
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.966
<i>You some kind of fucking idiot?</i>

383
00:32:38.633 --> 00:32:41.466
<i>Entire country up your ass</i>
<i>and you call me from a box?</i>

384
00:32:41.533 --> 00:32:44.066
I know. but there's been an accident.

385
00:32:44.433 --> 00:32:46.366
<i>-Put Junior on the phone.</i>
<i>-I can't.</i>

386
00:32:47.133 --> 00:32:49.433
Look. Michael's fine. okay?
He's with Matty.

387
00:32:49.633 --> 00:32:50.866
But the car's fucked.

388
00:32:51.666 --> 00:32:53.966
We're staying at a farm
until the storm passes.

389
00:32:55.133 --> 00:32:56.500
We just need more time.

390
00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.233
<i>There is no more time.</i>

391
00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:01.066
I've got the money.

392
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.600
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>
<i>We'll come for you.</i>

393
00:33:04.666 --> 00:33:05.866
No. no. It's fine.

394
00:33:05.933 --> 00:33:11.166
<i>I'm not asking. son.</i>
<i>And. Jack. my price just doubled.</i>

395
00:33:11.766 --> 00:33:16.300
<i>You want me to help your brother.</i>
<i>that is what it costs. Are we clear?</i>

396
00:33:17.066 --> 00:33:18.066
Crystal.

397
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.766
<i>Now. where's this farm?</i>

398
00:33:26.466 --> 00:33:27.833
Is this for me?

399
00:33:29.833 --> 00:33:32.300
There is a man
on his way to your farm right now.

400
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.200
Whatever I could do to you.
to your Maisy.

401
00:33:36.633 --> 00:33:40.466
is nothing compared to what he will do
when he finds out that his son is dead.

402
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.466
If he touches my family. I'll kill you.

403
00:33:46.433 --> 00:33:50.566
The only thing that will stand
between him and your family will be me.

404
00:33:51.233 --> 00:33:52.466
And that bag of money.

405
00:34:01.233 --> 00:34:02.333
Don't forget that.

406
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.200
Let's fucking go.

407
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.300
Forest of Knives. Madagascar.

408
00:34:15.866 --> 00:34:17.266
What do you think it's like?

409
00:34:17.466 --> 00:34:20.800
Well. I don't know. It sounds dangerous.

410
00:34:21.233 --> 00:34:22.366
You sound like Mama.

411
00:34:24.733 --> 00:34:28.666
Maybe you could come
and visit us in Norway.

412
00:34:30.133 --> 00:34:31.566
-Maybe.
-Yeah?

413
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.933
Mama likes me to be here
where it's safe.

414
00:34:39.633 --> 00:34:41.000
I feel safe here.

415
00:34:42.233 --> 00:34:43.233
Good.

416
00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.333
I like that you're here. too.

417
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.800
<i>...with an armed raid</i>
<i>in East London last Friday.</i>

418
00:34:48.333 --> 00:34:50.233
<i>Police believe Michael McCalister Jr..</i>

419
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.633
<i>along with brothers Jack</i>
<i>and Matthew Byrne. maybe headed north.</i>

420
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.900
<i>In the last few hours.</i>
<i>police have confirmed that Matthew Byrne</i>

421
00:34:57.966 --> 00:35:01.866
<i>is also wanted in relation to the death</i>
<i>of the mental health nurse Karen Carr.</i>

422
00:35:02.833 --> 00:35:04.833
<i>whose body was found</i>
<i>on Thursday evening.</i>

423
00:35:05.266 --> 00:35:08.033
<i>-I'll turn it off. it'll be fine.</i>
<i>-They may be armed...</i>

424
00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.900
Let's pretend we didn't hear it.

425
00:35:09.966 --> 00:35:11.933
-They were talking about you?
-No. no.

426
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.466
We just turn it off.
and it will be all right.

427
00:35:14.533 --> 00:35:17.666
-You're scaring me.
-I'm not lying. I'm not.

428
00:35:17.966 --> 00:35:21.800
No. I'm not. I didn't do anything.
I just need to...

429
00:35:24.233 --> 00:35:28.166
It wasn't me. It was a mistake.
It was an accident.

430
00:35:28.566 --> 00:35:31.066
I wasn't supposed to be there.
He left me there.

431
00:35:31.133 --> 00:35:32.800
-and he thinks...
-Don't touch me.

432
00:35:32.866 --> 00:35:35.966
He said it was for the best.
but it wasn't. He wouldn't listen.

433
00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:38.033
-I listen to you.
-Okay. Well. then...

434
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.233
You know. it was not my fault.
I need you to believe me. Okay?

435
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.900
-Okay.
-I did. but I didn't anything wrong.

436
00:35:44.966 --> 00:35:46.433
I never heard it. okay?

437
00:35:47.266 --> 00:35:50.200
We need to go back downstairs.
Mama's gonna be back soon.

438
00:35:50.266 --> 00:35:53.333
If she finds out I let you out.
we'll be in a lot of trouble.

439
00:35:54.433 --> 00:35:55.433
Okay?

440
00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.400
Now you think I'm bad.

441
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.500
No.

442
00:36:03.433 --> 00:36:05.433
I don't. Promise.

443
00:36:34.333 --> 00:36:35.600
Open up that door.

444
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.200
Now!

445
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.600
I need to give Pa his medication.

446
00:36:49.566 --> 00:36:52.266
Not till we get some ground rules set.
Matty. get out.

447
00:36:52.333 --> 00:36:55.166
-What's going on?
-It's gonna be all right. I promise.

448
00:36:55.233 --> 00:36:57.066
Listen to your mom. Move your ass.

449
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.666
We're back on track.
Mac's on his way. Let's go. Sit down!

450
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.566
-No.
-No. no. you! You. over there.

451
00:37:05.633 --> 00:37:07.600
She stays with me.
that's the end of it.

452
00:37:07.666 --> 00:37:10.100
-No. this is the fucking end of it!
-Jack. please.

453
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.866
Shut the fuck up. Matty! Go. Sit. now.

454
00:37:23.233 --> 00:37:24.666
We play it out tonight.

455
00:37:25.866 --> 00:37:27.166
Happy families. yeah?

456
00:37:28.433 --> 00:37:31.100
You don't do nothing.
you'll be all right.

457
00:37:31.366 --> 00:37:35.100
And tomorrow. we are gone.
You have my word.

458
00:37:37.133 --> 00:37:40.133
-Otherwise. I can finish it now.
-We'll do whatever you want.

459
00:37:40.766 --> 00:37:41.766
Damn right.

460
00:37:41.833 --> 00:37:42.933
You're bleeding. Jack.

461
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.533
I need his medication. Please.

462
00:37:54.233 --> 00:37:55.333
Go with her.

463
00:37:57.033 --> 00:37:58.666
You've got 60 seconds.

464
00:37:58.866 --> 00:38:02.200
or there won't be any medication
that will put him back together.

465
00:38:03.133 --> 00:38:04.133
Go.

466
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
What's it do?

467
00:38:23.433 --> 00:38:25.133
It manages the pain.

468
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.066
It's not right. the way he talks to you.

469
00:38:34.666 --> 00:38:38.100
No. he was right.
I shouldn't have said nothing.

470
00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:41.066
No. no. He's not right.

471
00:38:41.633 --> 00:38:44.500
I know what it's like to be beaten down.

472
00:38:45.466 --> 00:38:47.066
You deserve better.

473
00:38:57.633 --> 00:38:59.166
Hey. hey! What the fuck?

474
00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:00.700
-Maisy?
-There's a headlight.

475
00:39:00.833 --> 00:39:02.666
-It could be Mac.
-No. it's too soon.

476
00:39:02.733 --> 00:39:04.600
-What did you do?
-Don't touch her!

477
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.866
-No! She didn't do anything!
-Who the fuck is this clown? Move.

478
00:39:07.933 --> 00:39:10.000
-Go. go.
-No.

479
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.700
You've got to be shitting me.
It's a fucking cop. Come here.

480
00:39:18.766 --> 00:39:22.000
No. please don't do that.
If you do. there'll be more.

481
00:39:22.066 --> 00:39:23.700
-I'll fix it.
-You better.

482
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.800
Hey. take the kid into the back room.
Keep her quiet. No more fuck-ups.

483
00:39:27.866 --> 00:39:30.600
-You shouldn't talk to me like that.
-What did you say?

484
00:39:30.766 --> 00:39:32.833
-Nothing.
-You fucking dare?

485
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.100
Not now.

486
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.000
Hey. you.
Get rid of this fucking bumpkin.

487
00:39:51.266 --> 00:39:52.266
Hello?

488
00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.466
-Good evening. ma'am.
-Good evening.

489
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.166
Excuse the late hour.

490
00:40:02.766 --> 00:40:04.666
You mind if I come inside and explain?

491
00:40:05.933 --> 00:40:07.300
Yes. sure.

492
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.366
What in the God's name
has you out at this hour?

493
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.833
Man hunt. Nationwide.

494
00:40:17.366 --> 00:40:20.333
Armed robbery.
murder suspect. too. one of them.

495
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.700
It's all over the news.

496
00:40:22.266 --> 00:40:24.766
Forgive me.
News doesn't travel fast here.

497
00:40:31.866 --> 00:40:33.466
-May I?
-Of course.

498
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.500
Sorry about your radio.

499
00:40:41.966 --> 00:40:44.200
I'll get you a new one. A better one.

500
00:40:45.966 --> 00:40:46.966
A digital one.

501
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.766
Did you really hurt someone?

502
00:40:52.266 --> 00:40:53.633
I never hurt him.

503
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.233
Right. Sorry.

504
00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:01.833
It wasn't my fault.

505
00:41:04.233 --> 00:41:05.633
You do know that. don't you?

506
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.466
It's just an accident. right?

507
00:41:10.466 --> 00:41:11.466
Yeah.

508
00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.600
You think they came this way?

509
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.500
Unlikely. Word is they headed north.
Someone had to check.

510
00:41:24.333 --> 00:41:25.633
I drew the short straw.

511
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.400
Well. as you can see. no robbers here.

512
00:41:31.233 --> 00:41:33.766
Just the two of you
running all this land?

513
00:41:34.666 --> 00:41:35.666
That's right.

514
00:41:36.133 --> 00:41:37.300
That's quite the load.

515
00:41:37.966 --> 00:41:39.400
I'm heartier than I look.

516
00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.333
Guest?

517
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.200
No.

518
00:41:49.133 --> 00:41:50.666
We lost a child.

519
00:41:53.066 --> 00:41:57.433
It must seem sentimental.
but on special occasions. it helps.

520
00:42:03.666 --> 00:42:07.333
I would hate to impose.
but it's so grim out there.

521
00:42:07.966 --> 00:42:10.200
Any chance of some coffee
before I head out?

522
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.600
It's the shutter.

523
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.866
I'll get the coffee.

524
00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:35.300
Do you think you'll be out all night?

525
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.966
Looks that way.

526
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.233
At least till I hear otherwise.

527
00:42:39.833 --> 00:42:41.133
Not much this far out.

528
00:42:42.166 --> 00:42:45.900
But a couple more places
still to drop by.

529
00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.800
-What's that?
-It's a spasm.

530
00:43:06.233 --> 00:43:09.766
Involuntary. He needs his medication.

531
00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.400
Is he okay?

532
00:43:11.666 --> 00:43:16.733
Yes. he's fine. Fine.
I just need to sit him now.

533
00:43:18.633 --> 00:43:20.566
Are you sure everything's okay. ma'am?

534
00:43:20.633 --> 00:43:23.000
Jesus. yes. absolutely.

535
00:43:24.633 --> 00:43:26.233
It's just it's getting late.

536
00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.933
and I appreciate you coming
and checking in on us.

537
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.966
but my husband really needs me.

538
00:43:34.766 --> 00:43:36.266
If you won't mind with the...

539
00:43:37.866 --> 00:43:38.866
Of course.

540
00:43:44.566 --> 00:43:48.233
Well. just stay safe out there.
and I hope you find them.

541
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:54.933
Just before I go. your child.
what was the name?

542
00:43:57.033 --> 00:43:58.033
Ollie.

543
00:43:59.466 --> 00:44:01.033
His name was Ollie.

544
00:44:03.766 --> 00:44:04.900
Then who's this?

545
00:44:07.366 --> 00:44:10.500
I couldn't place her right away.
It's been so long.

546
00:44:12.333 --> 00:44:15.433
-It's her. though. isn't it?
-I'm sorry. I don't...

547
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.666
It's all anybody talked about
that summer.

548
00:44:17.733 --> 00:44:20.200
She just disappeared. The family. too.

549
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.933
Her mother's name was Bella.
But that's not you. though.

550
00:44:25.566 --> 00:44:27.266
-I don't...
-Is it. ma'am?

551
00:44:27.333 --> 00:44:28.333
Help.

552
00:44:30.233 --> 00:44:31.233
Ma'am?

553
00:44:58.266 --> 00:44:59.266
Fucker!

554
00:46:01.633 --> 00:46:02.900
Jesus Christ.

555
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.200
It is you.

556
00:46:11.633 --> 00:46:13.500
Mama. what did you do?

557
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:23.500
What the fuck?

558
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:28.700
Run.

559
00:46:28.766 --> 00:46:30.300
Pa just spoke. He just spoke.

560
00:46:30.366 --> 00:46:32.266
-No. baby.
-No. I heard him.

561
00:46:34.266 --> 00:46:37.333
No. you didn't. He was just convulsing.

562
00:46:45.866 --> 00:46:47.433
Look what you made me do.

563
00:46:56.033 --> 00:46:58.433
Why did you do that. Mama?
It's not right.

564
00:46:59.066 --> 00:47:00.900
I did it for you. baby.

565
00:47:01.533 --> 00:47:03.333
Everything I do is for you.

566
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.700
You killed him.

567
00:47:06.733 --> 00:47:11.500
No. He was confused.
and he'd have brought trouble with him.

568
00:47:12.033 --> 00:47:14.300
He'd have tried
to take you away from me.

569
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.766
And I will never let that happen. Ever.

570
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.200
You just trust me.

571
00:47:24.066 --> 00:47:25.600
You do what I tell you.

572
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.900
-Baby. can you help me. please?
-Mama. I can't.

573
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.533
You want them
to take you away from me?

574
00:48:08.666 --> 00:48:09.966
Is that what you want?

575
00:48:11.566 --> 00:48:14.500
Someday.
you'll have a family of your own.

576
00:48:14.566 --> 00:48:15.866
and you'll understand.

577
00:48:15.933 --> 00:48:19.466
How can I ever have a family of my own?
You keep me here to yourself.

578
00:48:19.533 --> 00:48:22.366
Yes. I'm trying to protect our family!

579
00:48:24.333 --> 00:48:25.866
No one ever protected me.

580
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.266
I couldn't protect them.

581
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.600
Just help me. And then it's done.

582
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.033
Go. Follow me.

583
00:49:30.566 --> 00:49:32.000
Hey. buddy.

584
00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.600
Matty.

585
00:49:35.266 --> 00:49:36.266
Matty!

586
00:50:00.266 --> 00:50:01.266
Hey!

587
00:50:03.633 --> 00:50:04.633
Hey!

588
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.200
Let us fucking go!

589
00:50:39.166 --> 00:50:40.600
Cover your ears. baby.

590
00:50:42.033 --> 00:50:43.700
What are you doing. Mama?

591
00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:48.266
We have to make it look
as if he found them here.

592
00:50:48.566 --> 00:50:50.166
Keep people away from us.

593
00:50:52.333 --> 00:50:56.100
Wait. no. Where is his phone?
Have you seen it?

594
00:50:57.366 --> 00:50:58.533
They can trace it.

595
00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:23.666
Fuck.

596
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.566
-Maisy. have you?
-No. no. I haven't seen it. Mama.

597
00:51:58.466 --> 00:52:01.400
It doesn't make sense.
Why'd anyone take you away from me?

598
00:52:02.233 --> 00:52:03.700
Because people are cruel.

599
00:52:04.166 --> 00:52:06.333
That's why I've had to shield you
from them.

600
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.800
Why are you scared of them?

601
00:52:07.866 --> 00:52:09.733
-The police are good.
-No one is good.

602
00:52:12.333 --> 00:52:14.166
Baby. I'm sorry.

603
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.400
But do you remember
the first time that I held you?

604
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:23.200
You were so weak and frightened.
But now. I've made you strong.

605
00:52:23.966 --> 00:52:28.666
And now. you have to be strong for me.
No more questions. okay?

606
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:31.600
God.

607
00:52:41.233 --> 00:52:42.300
Mama. Mama. look.

608
00:52:46.466 --> 00:52:47.466
There.

609
00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.800
Come here with Mama.

610
00:53:07.266 --> 00:53:10.600
Clever girl. You're so pretty.

611
00:53:11.633 --> 00:53:12.666
Look at you.

612
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.333
Jack. Jack!

613
00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.700
-Jack! Jack!
-Yeah. yeah. It's okay.

614
00:53:23.766 --> 00:53:25.433
I'm right here. Stop that.

615
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.133
-I can't move.
-I know.

616
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.466
-Stop pulling.
-May arm's stuck. I can't...

617
00:53:29.533 --> 00:53:31.833
-Stop pulling.
-Please. get it off me.

618
00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.600
-I can't breathe.
-Stop fucking pulling.

619
00:53:34.666 --> 00:53:36.966
-Stop. Calm down.
-I can't breathe.

620
00:53:37.033 --> 00:53:39.433
-Yes. you can.
-I can't breathe.

621
00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:44.300
Stop. Stop. Stop acting like
a fucking baby. all right?

622
00:53:50.533 --> 00:53:52.533
-It's fine.
-Get off me.

623
00:53:58.966 --> 00:53:59.966
It's okay.

624
00:54:00.466 --> 00:54:03.133
Hey. come on. I don't feel the fire.
Come on.

625
00:54:03.566 --> 00:54:05.366
Hey. hey.

626
00:54:05.866 --> 00:54:07.633
Hey. I don't feel the fire.

627
00:54:08.066 --> 00:54:11.233
Come on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. mate.

628
00:54:11.333 --> 00:54:12.700
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry.

629
00:54:14.233 --> 00:54:15.233
Where are we?

630
00:54:17.133 --> 00:54:18.466
We're in a lot of trouble.

631
00:54:19.933 --> 00:54:21.300
You should call the police.

632
00:54:22.466 --> 00:54:23.533
It's that woman.

633
00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.300
She spread that cop all over the floor
with a 12-gauge.

634
00:54:27.133 --> 00:54:28.366
Why did she do that?

635
00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:31.200
Because she's hiding something.

636
00:54:32.466 --> 00:54:33.933
A fucking whopper.

637
00:54:35.533 --> 00:54:38.233
But we need to get out of here.
Okay? I need your help.

638
00:54:39.266 --> 00:54:40.266
Okay. mate?

639
00:54:40.633 --> 00:54:42.800
Okay. Need to get this off the wall?

640
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.200
Okay? Can you pull with me?

641
00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.700
Come on. mate.

642
00:54:58.933 --> 00:54:59.933
Fuck!

643
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.766
Jack. it's okay.

644
00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.600
We're chained to a fucking wall
in a basement by a nut.

645
00:55:12.933 --> 00:55:14.166
I've got you.

646
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.266
Unless you've got any bright ideas.
we're pretty fucked.

647
00:55:28.833 --> 00:55:30.400
I'm not as dumb as you think.

648
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.333
Get in. Matty.

649
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:37.500
All right.

650
00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.433
We might be in business.

651
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.833
Thank you. baby.

652
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.500
You okay?

653
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.033
Do you remember
when I was very little. before the farm?

654
00:56:00.933 --> 00:56:02.400
There was a red brick house.

655
00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.266
You remember that.

656
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.933
What else do you remember?

657
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.200
My nightlight.

658
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.733
A blue hippo with your necklace
that sparkled against it.

659
00:56:17.266 --> 00:56:18.900
I was so scared of the dark.

660
00:56:19.533 --> 00:56:21.666
You'd lay there and hum this song to me.

661
00:56:22.266 --> 00:56:23.700
Always made it better.

662
00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.700
Then one day. you stopped.

663
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:33.800
Maybe you didn't need it anymore.

664
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:40.100
Sometimes I try to hum it to myself.
but I can't remember.

665
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.866
I'm scared now. Mama.

666
00:56:42.933 --> 00:56:44.233
Don't be. baby.

667
00:56:44.733 --> 00:56:49.566
We just need to be ready.
whoever shows up looking for those boys.

668
00:56:57.566 --> 00:56:58.566
Okay. okay.

669
00:57:05.333 --> 00:57:06.733
Okay. I'm gonna pull it.

670
00:57:07.366 --> 00:57:10.300
Ready? One. two. three.

671
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.400
Okay.

672
00:57:29.033 --> 00:57:30.866
All right. All right. hold it tight.

673
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Ready?

674
00:58:03.666 --> 00:58:05.033
Come on. use your shoulder.

675
00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.200
Fuck!

676
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.066
Look for another way out.

677
00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.366
That's it.

678
00:58:50.766 --> 00:58:51.766
Her car's gone.

679
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:54.000
Let's just go.

680
00:58:54.766 --> 00:58:55.866
We can't leave yet.

681
00:58:57.066 --> 00:58:59.166
Please. I don't wanna hurt anyone else.

682
00:58:59.866 --> 00:59:02.466
Nice. What do you think
she had planned for us?

683
00:59:02.533 --> 00:59:03.966
She was protecting Maisy.

684
00:59:04.366 --> 00:59:05.666
From who? The police?

685
00:59:05.833 --> 00:59:07.966
Use your fucking head.
She won't let us go.

686
00:59:08.633 --> 00:59:09.633
Please.

687
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:12.200
Where do you wanna go?

688
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.400
Well...

689
00:59:14.066 --> 00:59:18.233
She said there's a town nearby.
Maybe we could boost a car...

690
00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:20.300
The only way out of here
is through Mac.

691
00:59:20.366 --> 00:59:23.200
And we need the money.
We're starting again with nothing.

692
00:59:23.366 --> 00:59:24.366
I can't do that.

693
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.833
Hey. hey. That's our in.

694
00:59:33.766 --> 00:59:36.566
Yeah? Get yourself to that sheep barn.
Wait for me there.

695
00:59:36.733 --> 00:59:38.033
Why can't I come with you?

696
00:59:39.233 --> 00:59:40.966
Because I need your eyes out here.

697
00:59:41.333 --> 00:59:43.100
No. please. I don't wanna be alone.

698
00:59:43.166 --> 00:59:45.933
I don't have time
for your shit right now. okay?

699
00:59:46.066 --> 00:59:47.966
-Get in the fucking barn.
-No!

700
00:59:49.833 --> 00:59:51.166
Why do you hate me?

701
00:59:53.033 --> 00:59:55.400
-How do you say that to me?
-Because it's true.

702
00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:58.900
All of your life. it's been just me.

703
01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:02.966
We were put in that home when mom died.
I got us out.

704
01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:05.533
-I kept us safe.
-Why'd you put me in Norton View?

705
01:00:09.866 --> 01:00:12.066
-For your sake.
-You wanted to get rid of me.

706
01:00:13.666 --> 01:00:15.966
Now that woman is dead.
and you put that on me.

707
01:00:16.166 --> 01:00:18.200
I never meant to hurt her.

708
01:00:18.566 --> 01:00:20.700
-What about Michael?
-He was laughing at me.

709
01:00:20.766 --> 01:00:25.033
because I read the map wrong.
And he was always laughing at me!

710
01:00:25.166 --> 01:00:26.533
We needed him. Matty.

711
01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.300
Him and his old man's connections.
and you...

712
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.266
It's not my fault! It's not my fault.

713
01:00:32.333 --> 01:00:33.933
It's all your fucking fault!

714
01:00:34.466 --> 01:00:36.700
You don't see it
because I follow you around

715
01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:38.533
cleaning up your shit out of guilt.

716
01:00:38.933 --> 01:00:41.533
Like I failed you somehow.
and that's why you're ill.

717
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.066
But that is not what it is. Matty.

718
01:00:46.233 --> 01:00:47.766
You're just a nasty fuck-up.

719
01:00:48.333 --> 01:00:52.066
Right down to your core.
It's who you've been from the start.

720
01:00:58.466 --> 01:01:00.433
I wish you'd died and not mom.

721
01:01:10.766 --> 01:01:12.200
Do you wanna know the truth?

722
01:01:15.233 --> 01:01:16.366
She didn't die.

723
01:01:17.933 --> 01:01:18.933
She left.

724
01:01:19.366 --> 01:01:21.133
Because she couldn't deal with you.

725
01:01:26.233 --> 01:01:27.500
-You're lying.
-No.

726
01:01:29.866 --> 01:01:32.933
All you did was fucking cry and whinge.

727
01:01:33.833 --> 01:01:36.000
And she couldn't do it.

728
01:01:36.666 --> 01:01:39.933
Doctors said there was nothing
wrong with you. It was just colic.

729
01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.066
But you wouldn't fucking stop.

730
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.300
She couldn't do it.

731
01:01:45.366 --> 01:01:46.900
-She left.
-No. you're lying.

732
01:01:46.966 --> 01:01:49.233
She died. You told me she died.

733
01:01:49.933 --> 01:01:50.933
No.

734
01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.066
I used to think that before you came.
she was perfect.

735
01:01:59.266 --> 01:02:00.333
She wasn't.

736
01:02:01.666 --> 01:02:04.500
She was always a selfish piece of shit.

737
01:02:05.733 --> 01:02:07.066
But she was mine.

738
01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.666
I was meant to be something proper.

739
01:02:11.633 --> 01:02:14.533
But everything good in me.
I had to give it to you.

740
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.500
I can't do that anymore.

741
01:02:21.066 --> 01:02:23.300
After this day. mate.
you are on your own.

742
01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:29.200
Well. nothing you ever do
is really for me.

743
01:02:30.633 --> 01:02:33.100
It's always for you.
You never ask what I want.

744
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.300
You think you'd be
so much better without me?

745
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.900
You'll always be nothing.

746
01:02:41.166 --> 01:02:42.566
It wasn't just me she left.

747
01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:44.700
She didn't want you either.

748
01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:50.466
Yeah.

749
01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:55.866
Get in the barn. mate.

750
01:04:38.866 --> 01:04:42.366
What if we just took the money and left
before anyone gets here?

751
01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.033
We're not running. baby.
This is our home.

752
01:05:16.733 --> 01:05:17.733
Hey.

753
01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:21.133
Hey. turn around.

754
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Slowly.

755
01:05:24.766 --> 01:05:26.866
Get up now! I'm not fucking about!

756
01:06:05.166 --> 01:06:06.866
You were driving the other car.

757
01:06:35.666 --> 01:06:38.466
Hey. hey.

758
01:06:41.833 --> 01:06:42.833
Where is she?

759
01:06:44.933 --> 01:06:45.933
She's gone.

760
01:06:48.566 --> 01:06:50.300
Where is Jenny?

761
01:06:53.066 --> 01:06:54.066
She's...

762
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.433
She's gone. too.

763
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.600
Police.

764
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:07.166
Call... Call the police.

765
01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.633
I can't do that.

766
01:07:13.366 --> 01:07:14.500
Help us.

767
01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:21.500
You'll help me prepare the boys
and then you'll wait with Pa.

768
01:07:21.566 --> 01:07:23.866
-But...
-No. Listen to me.

769
01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:26.533
I want you out of sight
till this is done.

770
01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.300
-No more risks.
-What if I...

771
01:07:28.366 --> 01:07:29.966
Don't make me tell you again.

772
01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.800
Wait here.

773
01:07:38.933 --> 01:07:39.933
What about Pa?

774
01:08:14.366 --> 01:08:15.366
Fuck off!

775
01:08:28.633 --> 01:08:30.100
Maybe I can lower you down.

776
01:08:30.833 --> 01:08:33.033
It's not that far. You just hold me.

777
01:08:33.533 --> 01:08:34.533
No.

778
01:08:36.666 --> 01:08:39.000
Stop. Okay. stop.

779
01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.300
We need to go before she gets back.

780
01:08:41.566 --> 01:08:42.966
No. No.

781
01:08:44.066 --> 01:08:45.066
She...

782
01:08:47.266 --> 01:08:49.500
She hums all night.

783
01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.266
She remembers.

784
01:08:52.766 --> 01:08:55.966
No. Jenny remembers me. all right?

785
01:08:56.033 --> 01:08:59.433
Why don't help me...?

786
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.700
I'm trying. okay?

787
01:09:00.766 --> 01:09:01.800
No.

788
01:09:06.433 --> 01:09:07.533
-Help me.
-It's okay.

789
01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.600
No. I don't wanna do that. Please.

790
01:09:10.666 --> 01:09:15.433
It's okay. It's okay.
Just help me. Help me sleep.

791
01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.633
How many times? Please.

792
01:09:20.633 --> 01:09:21.633
Please.

793
01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.933
I'm not me anymore.

794
01:09:27.366 --> 01:09:28.366
Help me.

795
01:09:29.333 --> 01:09:32.000
Help me sleep. please.

796
01:09:36.866 --> 01:09:41.700
I don't want to live like this.
Just kill me.

797
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.633
It's all right. It's all right.

798
01:11:18.066 --> 01:11:20.500
You said
it doesn't have to be like this. Jack.

799
01:11:22.033 --> 01:11:23.466
Well. it still doesn't.

800
01:11:24.433 --> 01:11:25.700
Can you hear me?

801
01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:28.933
We have to think of Matty.

802
01:11:31.766 --> 01:11:32.966
We need to talk.

803
01:11:40.166 --> 01:11:41.166
Matt?

804
01:11:41.866 --> 01:11:42.866
What?

805
01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:44.666
He left me here.

806
01:11:47.433 --> 01:11:51.966
He said that no one wants me.

807
01:11:53.566 --> 01:11:54.566
And...

808
01:11:55.533 --> 01:11:58.166
He said that mom didn't want me.

809
01:12:01.933 --> 01:12:03.566
She didn't deserve you.

810
01:12:05.466 --> 01:12:07.900
Mine didn't deserve me either.

811
01:12:09.133 --> 01:12:12.066
She did terrible things.

812
01:12:14.266 --> 01:12:15.266
Terrible.

813
01:12:21.466 --> 01:12:23.933
You remind me of my Ollie.

814
01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.900
Maybe we belong together.

815
01:12:37.566 --> 01:12:39.266
I don't feel fine.

816
01:12:39.633 --> 01:12:41.500
No.

817
01:12:44.766 --> 01:12:46.466
I'm gonna look after you.

818
01:12:47.933 --> 01:12:49.233
Come to Mama.

819
01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.300
Come to Mama.

820
01:14:13.633 --> 01:14:14.633
Jeez.

821
01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:31.966
Fuck!

822
01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:26.333
Slow down.

823
01:16:10.533 --> 01:16:13.233
What the fuck? Is she in here?

824
01:16:14.366 --> 01:16:15.366
Where?

825
01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:26.466
Crap! Listen to me! Listen to me!
Listen. Listen.

826
01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:29.200
I'm not the one.
Okay? She's lying to you.

827
01:16:29.266 --> 01:16:30.900
All of it is a lie.

828
01:16:31.833 --> 01:16:32.833
Fuck.

829
01:16:33.233 --> 01:16:34.233
Move!

830
01:16:35.233 --> 01:16:37.466
Get in there. Get in there. Move.

831
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.900
Not a fucking sound.

832
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.700
Okay. okay.

833
01:17:10.833 --> 01:17:12.766
-I can scream for her.
-Yeah. you could.

834
01:17:13.033 --> 01:17:15.966
Then you'll never know the truth.
will you? Watch yourself.

835
01:17:16.433 --> 01:17:18.133
Pa. You okay?

836
01:17:21.533 --> 01:17:23.500
You said she's lying. What do you mean?

837
01:17:24.266 --> 01:17:26.466
Your name's not Maisy. It's Jenny.

838
01:17:27.233 --> 01:17:29.433
This isn't your home.
She isn't your mom.

839
01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:33.900
The accident that killed Ollie
killed her husband. too.

840
01:17:33.966 --> 01:17:36.033
and her baby. Maisy.

841
01:17:38.133 --> 01:17:39.566
What are you talking about?

842
01:17:41.933 --> 01:17:43.900
Your mom was driving the other car.

843
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.800
Your real one.

844
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.266
Look. she took you and your dad
to replace her family as payback.

845
01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:54.466
As punishment. I know. she's mental.

846
01:17:54.533 --> 01:17:56.066
-You're lying.
-Why?

847
01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.500
-Why would I?
-Because you're a killer.

848
01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:01.733
You saw somebody get killed tonight.

849
01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.533
It wasn't me holding the gun.
Think about it.

850
01:18:06.533 --> 01:18:07.833
Here. look.

851
01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:28.266
I remember this. I remember her face.

852
01:18:29.233 --> 01:18:31.733
What happened to her?
Do you know where she is?

853
01:18:35.633 --> 01:18:36.633
I don't know.

854
01:18:45.566 --> 01:18:48.800
How the fuck is this glued shut?
Come on. help me.

855
01:18:50.233 --> 01:18:52.033
You won't get out of these shutters.

856
01:18:58.666 --> 01:19:01.033
Okay. fuck it.
We'll go out through the front.

857
01:19:08.766 --> 01:19:11.033
Hey. Soul search later.

858
01:19:11.833 --> 01:19:15.033
Call the police. I don't give a fuck.
But right now. we gotta go.

859
01:19:15.433 --> 01:19:16.566
What about Mama?

860
01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:19.033
-Fuck her.
-I can't just leave.

861
01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.833
Well. then don't. Stay here.

862
01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.233
But you won't get the chance
to leave again.

863
01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:26.800
-Where will I go?
-You figure that out on the way.

864
01:19:26.866 --> 01:19:29.533
Just get your old boy into the truck.
I'll get Matty.

865
01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:33.166
We'll call Mac from the road.
I'm not missing that boat.

866
01:19:33.666 --> 01:19:35.166
Why are you helping us?

867
01:19:38.433 --> 01:19:39.566
It's not about you.

868
01:19:43.233 --> 01:19:44.466
What's it gonna be?

869
01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.500
Come on.

870
01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:03.233
Put him in the car.

871
01:20:16.266 --> 01:20:17.266
Matty.

872
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.266
Fuck.

873
01:20:34.866 --> 01:20:35.866
Where is he?

874
01:20:36.633 --> 01:20:37.666
I don't know.

875
01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:40.233
Please. please. can we just go now?

876
01:20:42.666 --> 01:20:43.666
Please.

877
01:20:43.766 --> 01:20:44.766
Fuck!

878
01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.100
Just...

879
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:51.166
Just stay here.

880
01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:57.600
Okay.

881
01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:00.166
Okay.

882
01:21:24.866 --> 01:21:25.866
Matty.

883
01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.666
What the fuck are you doing up?

884
01:21:30.433 --> 01:21:32.000
She wants me to stay.

885
01:21:32.433 --> 01:21:33.433
What?

886
01:21:39.266 --> 01:21:40.500
Where is my daughter?

887
01:21:40.566 --> 01:21:43.366
-What did you do to her?
-You said you wouldn't hurt him!

888
01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.300
-Matty!
-You know when your friends arrive.

889
01:21:47.433 --> 01:21:50.366
someone has to be accountable
for the dead body in the car.

890
01:21:50.566 --> 01:21:52.300
You think he won't give you away?

891
01:21:52.366 --> 01:21:53.666
No. he'd never do that.

892
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.666
You said yourself
he doesn't care about you.

893
01:21:57.066 --> 01:21:59.433
-You can't hurt...
-Shut up. you fucking nutter!

894
01:21:59.566 --> 01:22:01.000
Matty. what are you doing?

895
01:22:01.766 --> 01:22:04.600
Jack. please. no.
You don't have to look after me anymore.

896
01:22:04.833 --> 01:22:06.200
Mama's gonna look after me.

897
01:22:06.266 --> 01:22:09.933
And all you have to do
is just give back Maisy. please.

898
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.233
I know what you've done.

899
01:22:15.233 --> 01:22:16.433
I've seen upstairs.

900
01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:17.933
What?

901
01:22:19.666 --> 01:22:24.133
She owed me. She owed me a debt.

902
01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.766
The kid knows. too. She's gone.

903
01:22:25.833 --> 01:22:28.033
-What did you tell her?
-Everything.

904
01:22:28.333 --> 01:22:29.733
Ask her what she's done.

905
01:22:30.333 --> 01:22:31.366
She's insane.

906
01:22:31.433 --> 01:22:35.633
No. She took my family. I took hers!

907
01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:41.100
Maybe there could be
a place for you. too.

908
01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.533
You could stop running. Jack.

909
01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:48.733
They say
that you can't choose your family.

910
01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:52.333
But you can.

911
01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:05.400
She's right about choosing family.

912
01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:08.800
If you burn. I burn.

913
01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:14.266
No. Jack. please! Stop!
No. Please. Jack. no. please.

914
01:23:14.333 --> 01:23:16.200
-What are you doing?
-Can't we stay?

915
01:23:16.266 --> 01:23:18.233
-Fuck off! What are you doing?
-Please!

916
01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:21.666
I don't want anything. Let her go. Jack!
Stop! We can stay here.

917
01:23:21.733 --> 01:23:23.733
-Shut the fuck up! Stay there!
-Please!

918
01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:27.200
-Please. Jack! I don't want to!
-Shut up!

919
01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.366
No. Jack! Stop!

920
01:23:31.166 --> 01:23:34.033
No!

921
01:23:53.366 --> 01:23:54.733
Are you okay. Mama?

922
01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.066
Get up. Come on.

923
01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.300
Come on.

924
01:24:04.966 --> 01:24:05.966
Come on.

925
01:24:13.166 --> 01:24:15.266
Come on. Come on.

926
01:24:15.866 --> 01:24:18.500
Stop! I'm warning you. Jack!

927
01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.500
Maisy?

928
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.300
Are you okay?

929
01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:36.366
Are you all right?

930
01:24:39.866 --> 01:24:41.233
Listen to me. baby.

931
01:24:42.033 --> 01:24:43.900
Everything's gonna be all right.

932
01:24:47.166 --> 01:24:48.433
Will you come out?

933
01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:55.100
I promise you.

934
01:24:57.133 --> 01:24:58.800
-I'm not angry.
-Is it true?

935
01:25:00.066 --> 01:25:01.733
You're not my real mama?

936
01:25:03.366 --> 01:25:04.833
Of course I am.

937
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.966
I'm the one that raised you.

938
01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.766
I'm the one that cared for you.

939
01:25:13.166 --> 01:25:16.000
I'm your mama. and you're mine!

940
01:25:18.566 --> 01:25:19.766
No. Mama.

941
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:22.233
No. you're not!

942
01:25:28.533 --> 01:25:31.933
Mac. Mac's here. Mac's here! Jack!

943
01:25:34.166 --> 01:25:35.366
Do you hear that?

944
01:25:35.933 --> 01:25:38.833
-It's over!
-No. you owe me a debt!

945
01:25:40.133 --> 01:25:42.233
Get yourself out here. lads!

946
01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.400
Good luck.

947
01:25:52.033 --> 01:25:54.066
-No. Mama. wait! Wait!
-What? No!

948
01:26:10.933 --> 01:26:12.333
Who the fuck is that?

949
01:26:13.233 --> 01:26:14.866
It's a long story.

950
01:26:15.666 --> 01:26:16.700
How many in there?

951
01:26:17.033 --> 01:26:18.033
It's just her.

952
01:26:21.966 --> 01:26:23.300
Are you fucking with me?

953
01:26:24.633 --> 01:26:25.633
One woman?

954
01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.100
Where's my money. Jack?

955
01:26:30.366 --> 01:26:31.366
She's got it.

956
01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.200
And my son?

957
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.000
She took him. too.

958
01:26:38.066 --> 01:26:39.133
Did she?

959
01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:45.100
All right. let's go.
Come on. son. Come on. son. That's it.

960
01:26:46.566 --> 01:26:47.900
What was your plan?

961
01:26:48.466 --> 01:26:49.666
Get fucking back.

962
01:26:52.666 --> 01:26:53.666
Now...

963
01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:58.300
I found your car on the way in.

964
01:27:04.966 --> 01:27:06.866
Up. up.

965
01:27:08.566 --> 01:27:10.900
Are you really that fucking stupid?

966
01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:14.900
You think I wouldn't have noticed
Junior's not fucking here?

967
01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:20.766
Where is Matty?

968
01:27:21.566 --> 01:27:22.566
Please.

969
01:27:23.133 --> 01:27:24.100
Please.

970
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.233
-Please.
-Please.

971
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:30.466
Matty!

972
01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.633
No. Matty!

973
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.000
Please. Mac. don't hurt him!

974
01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:43.600
God.

975
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Hurt him?

976
01:27:47.766 --> 01:27:48.766
No.

977
01:27:50.366 --> 01:27:53.933
I'm gonna cut him open
and splash around him what comes out.

978
01:27:57.866 --> 01:27:58.866
Matty!

979
01:28:00.733 --> 01:28:01.833
Come out now.

980
01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.466
That's the boy.

981
01:28:06.533 --> 01:28:08.100
It wasn't Jack.

982
01:28:09.866 --> 01:28:11.133
I killed Michael.

983
01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:15.033
If you're gonna hurt someone.
it should be me.

984
01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.200
Matty. stay here.

985
01:28:16.933 --> 01:28:18.366
This isn't on you.

986
01:28:19.466 --> 01:28:21.266
My money buys your life.

987
01:28:21.733 --> 01:28:23.866
But these two pieces of shit.

988
01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:26.666
they're already in the fucking ground.

989
01:28:26.866 --> 01:28:30.400
I don't want your money. Take it.
You want him? You can take him. too.

990
01:28:30.466 --> 01:28:32.366
But you're not touching this boy.

991
01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.666
Is that right?

992
01:28:35.933 --> 01:28:37.200
You know what he's done?

993
01:28:38.533 --> 01:28:40.333
Are you ready to die for that?

994
01:28:40.433 --> 01:28:42.300
It won't be me that dies today.

995
01:28:43.966 --> 01:28:46.500
That sounds dangerously like a threat...

996
01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.633
You fucking...

997
01:28:55.433 --> 01:28:56.566
Fuck!

998
01:29:30.033 --> 01:29:32.700
You crazy. fucking bitch...!

999
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.300
God!

1000
01:30:02.033 --> 01:30:03.033
You okay?

1001
01:30:05.866 --> 01:30:07.866
Doctors say your father's coming around.

1002
01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:09.666
He's asked for you.

1003
01:30:11.733 --> 01:30:12.833
Do you wanna see him?

1004
01:30:16.333 --> 01:30:17.466
We'll catch her.

1005
01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:19.700
Don't worry.

1006
01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:38.800
<i>She can be glorious.</i>

1007
01:30:40.933 --> 01:30:42.066
<i>benevolent</i>

1008
01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.933
<i>or filled with wrath.</i>

1009
01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.100
<i>Her job is to protect.</i>

1010
01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:56.100
<i>No matter the cost.</i>

1011
01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.300
<i>And if anyone</i>
<i>were to ever harm her family.</i>

1012
01:31:05.533 --> 01:31:07.866
<i>there's no telling</i>
<i>what she'd be capable of.</i>
