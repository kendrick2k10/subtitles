a tax law attorney." [laughs]

172
00:06:53.704 --> 00:06:55.665
[chuckles] Does that happen to anyone?

173
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.625
Tax attorneys. probably.

[both chuckle]

175
00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.046
Where are you headed?

176
00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.298
Uh. London. You?

177
00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:06.676
Same. Yeah. I'm actually. uh...

178
00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:09.303
[chuckles] ...I'm supposed to be
in the air currently.

179
00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:11.639
- But I missed my flight by four minutes.
- Ooh.

180
00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.600
I... I'd say it was fate.

181
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.936
but you probably <i>chose</i>
to be four minutes late.

182
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.105
- [Hadley] Hmm.
- [both chuckle]

[Hadley sighs]

184
00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.403
[Oliver] I was gonna go get some food.

185
00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.654
Do you wanna come with?

186
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:30.616
Is that. like.
a... third date thing for you?

187
00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.410
[both chuckle]

188
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.829
- No. food would be great.

I assume that London is your home.

Yeah. To be honest. I'd rather stay here.

195

Don't wanna get behind on my research.

196

I love 'em.

Why?

209
00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:18.831
I like how you're neither here

211
00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.877
No. it sounds lovely.

No. I just... I just hate mayonnaise.

- Dentists and small spaces.

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.982
- You've thought about this.
- [Hadley] Not really.

222
00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:46.901
Like. if I were to ask
what you're afraid of.

223
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.736
you wouldn't have to think.
You would know.

224
00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:50.446
Well. how do you know I'm not fearless?

225
00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:53.491

You did?

233
00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:10.716
I blame the gym's Wi-Fi. It's a bit dodgy.

And by the way. I've got a little surprise
planned for you. so... be ready for that.

237
00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:20.142
What? No. I don't like surprises.

238
00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:21.978
It's a good one. You can't be annoyed.

239
00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.063
I've warned you.
so you can't be as pissed.

240
00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.189

- [Hadley] Okay.

So if claustrophobia
is one of your biggest fears.

250

then why are you about
to embark on a seven-hour flight?

[Hadley] That <i>is</i> a very good question.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:56.262
Same as you?

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.139
[Oliver] Right.

That is actually my loungewear.

Then I guess
this really <i>is</i> your lucky day.

342
00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:35.981
Well. this is unexpected.

343
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:39.527
I would've thought you'd seen it coming.
Mr. Predictive Analytics.

344
00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:42.988
All right. okay. Very good.

345
00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.990
- Well done.

346
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.826
- [Hadley] Hmm.
- Do you always get pj's?

347
00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.495
[chuckling] I've actually
never flown business either.

348
00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.123
Do you mind if I...

349
00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:54.959
- Oh. thank you.
- Wipe you down--

350
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.169
Uh. not. uh. like that.

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:12.434
Over the next 6 hours and 47 minutes.

355
00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:15.271
Hadley Sullivan
and Oliver Jones will fall in love.

356
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.485
But then. 18 minutes after they land.

357
00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:24.697
they'll be separated in a crowd
and never see each other again.

358
00:14:25.823 --> 00:14:30.411
Well. that's unless they get each other's
name or number or email.

There's loads of options. really.

Yeah. See. um. her phone was dead.

so I gallantly offered her my charger.

434
00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:37.598

00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:38.849

436
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:41.310
And he's been charging
my batteries ever since.

437
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.728
[woman] Oh. good for you two.

[woman chuckles. sighs]

439
00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:46.523
Anyway. have a nice flight.

440
00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:47.608
[Hadley] You too.

441
00:17:48.275 --> 00:17:50.736
- [sighs]
- So. tell me more about this wedding.

442
00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.489
Oh. yeah. uh... [laughs]

443
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:54.865
Yeah. um...

444
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:59.536
[clicks tongue]
It's my dad's second marriage

445
00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:01.205
to a woman I've never met before.

446
00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:02.539
[clicks tongue] So...

447
00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:05.542
- So you're going to your dad's wedding.
- Yep.

448
00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.753
And you've never met his fiancée.

449
00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.171
- Nope.
- How does that work?

450
00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:12.382
Well...

451
00:18:12.382 --> 00:18:18.305
[laughs] Um. it starts when he gets
a job teaching poetry at Oxford.

452
00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:21.100
Then after promising
that that will only last for a semester.

453
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.436
he files for divorce from your mom

454
00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:27.523
and falls in love
with a woman named Charlotte

455
00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:30.109
and proceeds to ask her to marry him.

456
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:33.570
And then he makes you.
who he hasn't seen for over a year.

457
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.490
fly across the ocean in a tin can

458
00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.868
so you can stand next to him
wearing a dress the color of a bruise.

459
00:18:39.868 --> 00:18:41.286
That's awful.

460
00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:43.539
- Yeah.
- [both laugh]

461
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:48.168
If it's. uh. any consolation.
50% of marriages do end in divorce.

462
00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:50.129
That means 50% don't.

463
00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:54.591
Yeah. but I mean. the chances
of this happening were incredibly high.

464
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:56.385
Is that supposed
to make me feel any better?

465
00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:57.886
- Doesn't it?
- [Hadley] No.

466
00:18:57.886 --> 00:18:59.471
I think it just sucks.

467
00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:01.974
You know. the worst part is that

468
00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.643
he's gonna get up tomorrow.

469
00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.395
and he's gonna make
the exact same promises

470
00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:07.479
that he just broke.

471
00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:10.023
I get that people can fall in love again.

472
00:19:10.023 --> 00:19:11.316
I just feel like. if it's real.

473
00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:13.152
why do you have to try
so hard to prove it?

474
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:18.615
Why do you have to throw this big.
grand party to rub it in everyone's face?

475
00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:22.244
I think that real love isn't about that.

476
00:19:23.287 --> 00:19:25.414
Real love is about finding someone

477
00:19:26.206 --> 00:19:28.625
that will hold your hand
when life gets rough.

478
00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:30.377
And that's it?

479
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.008
No wedding. no marriage. just...
someone to hold your hand through life?

480
00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.676
[gentle music playing]

481
00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:38.677
Yeah. pretty much.

482
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:46.018
I like that...
weddings are a promise. I guess.

483
00:19:48.228 --> 00:19:50.189
Not everyone keeps their promises.

484
00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:52.774
[gentle music fades]

485
00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:54.067
Anyways.

486
00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.820
that's my wedding. [laughs]

487
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.863
What's yours?

488
00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:01.283
Please say something dramatic.
like your stepmom's marrying your uncle

489
00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:02.618
or something like that.

490
00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:05.037
- [chuckles] Um...
- So what'll it be?

491
00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:09.041
Some delicious chicken and vegetables.
or some... very dry fish?

492
00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:10.709
- Chicken.
- [narrator] Mm.

493
00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:12.127
- Right.
- [Hadley] Um...

494
00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:14.379
I'm gonna go for the fish...

495
00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:17.007
Chicken.

496
00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.425
Excellent choice. madam.

497
00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:21.929
- Wow. our second dinner date.
- [Hadley] Hmm.

498
00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:23.805

[inhales deeply] All right?

504
00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.420
Yeah. Sorry. I...

505
00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:57.339
Oh my God. [laughs]

506
00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:00.300
- I mean...
- Sexy. I know.

507
00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:02.636
- Perfect fit.
- I thought so.

508
00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:04.012
- Look cute.
- [laughs]

509
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.182
Oh. you weren't lying about Dickens.

510
00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:08.267
Oh. um...

511
00:21:08.892 --> 00:21:11.228
[clicks tongue]
...I actually haven't read this one.

512
00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:13.021
- Hmm. Looks like someone has.
- [Hadley] Yeah.

513
00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:17.150
Um. it was my dad's.
He gave it to me after the divorce.

514
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.278
It was a thing that we would do.

515

as often to you now.

520

But certain ones are too important
to get lost in all this.

you and your dad were very close.

which means the odds are
you will eventually forgive him.

Yeah. with our mum and dad.

Well. until a few months ago

when he decided to buy
a garish green Sprinter van.

00:24:49.696 --> 00:24:51.698
Hmm. Those are cool.

Are you guys close. historically?

- You ask a lot of questions. don't you?
- Are you?

Our mum got sick when we were kids.

So. yeah. But we're both very different.

590
00:25:11.927 --> 00:25:13.803
It's fine. though. I'm used to it now.

592
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:20.936
Uh. she was in remission
for 14 years. but it came back.

593
00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:23.980
I'm sorry.

00:46:32.664 --> 00:46:35.042
being here. uh. today.

1030
00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:40.714
Well. yes. so what happened was
that Val and I were planning my funeral.

1031
00:46:40.714 --> 00:46:44.009
and it was just turning into
such a brilliant show

1032
00:46:44.009 --> 00:46:47.221
that I realized
I... I wanted to be alive to see it. so...

1033
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:48.722
And you <i>are</i> right.

1034
00:46:49.515 --> 00:46:53.894
I <i>do</i> hate it when people say
nice things about me behind my back.

1035
00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:55.979
I think it's a... it's a tragic waste.

1036
00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:56.897
[guests laugh]

1037
00:46:58.774 --> 00:47:03.153
You only really know
what kind of story yours is

1038
00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.613
when you know the ending.

1039
00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:07.699
And. um... [clicks tongue]

1040
00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:13.247
...I now know that mine is a love story.

1041
00:47:13.872 --> 00:47:14.998
[somber music playing]

1042
00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:18.836
I feel like my life really began
the first day that I met Val

1043
00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:20.879
in a Shakespeare class.

1044
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:22.506
Uh. at uni.

1045
00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:25.092
[dramatically] He was giving
his Richard III.

1046
00:47:25.092 --> 00:47:26.426
- Brilliantly.
- Terrible.

1047
00:47:26.426 --> 00:47:28.303
[Tess and guests laugh]

1048
00:47:28.303 --> 00:47:30.556
[Tess] But as the Bard says.

1049
00:47:30.556 --> 00:47:34.643
"Whoever loved.
that loved not at first sight?" [chuckles]

1050
00:47:34.643 --> 00:47:37.145
What can I say? I have eccentric tastes.

1051
00:47:37.729 --> 00:47:41.358
[sighs] And since then we have written

1052
00:47:41.358 --> 00:47:46.196
the most beautiful story together
with our two darling. dashing.

1053
00:47:47.114 --> 00:47:49.575
daring sons. [chuckles. sighs]

1054
00:47:49.575 --> 00:47:53.704
And I am so grateful
to each one of you for being a part of it.

1055
00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.333
It's been glorious.

1056
00:47:59.668 --> 00:48:01.295
So. let's be merry.

1057
00:48:02.004 --> 00:48:05.424
Let's eat as much as we possibly can

1058
00:48:05.424 --> 00:48:07.092
and get really drunk. [laughs]

1059
00:48:07.092 --> 00:48:11.221
- [guests laugh]
- [Tess] And the only rule of the day is...

1060
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.896
[tearfully] ...don't forget to say goodbye.

1061
00:48:19.438 --> 00:48:21.064
[softly] Okay. Ta-da!

1062
00:48:21.815 --> 00:48:22.649
The end.

1063
00:48:22.649 --> 00:48:25.527
- [Val] Ah! Thank you. thank you!
- [guests cheer]

1064
00:48:25.527 --> 00:48:27.738
[Val] We should be here
for at least one night only.

1065
00:48:29.823 --> 00:48:32.284
Get this old hand off the stage.

1066
00:48:32.284 --> 00:48:33.285
[laughs]

1067
00:48:33.285 --> 00:48:36.330
[uplifting music playing]

1068
00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:40.834

I just...

1125
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:39.971
I just don't understand
why you're not getting treatment.

1126
00:51:41.223 --> 00:51:42.224
I've read the data.

1127
00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:44.976
I know that...

1128
00:51:44.976 --> 00:51:48.146
I know that if you started with the chemo
with an anti-inflammatory diet.

1129
00:51:48.146 --> 00:51:51.149
you could have another 6 months.
12 months. maybe even 18 months.

1130
00:51:51.149 --> 00:51:52.067
Why?

1131
00:51:55.153 --> 00:51:56.029
Serious question.

1132
00:51:57.656 --> 00:51:59.991
So. I can... be sick

1133
00:52:00.992 --> 00:52:01.827
all the time?

1134
00:52:01.827 --> 00:52:02.953
[Oliver sighs]

1135
00:52:04.412 --> 00:52:05.247

[softly] I know. I'm sorry.

1139
00:52:12.712 --> 00:52:17.008
But three months. six. 12 months.
it doesn't really make any difference.

1140
00:52:17.008 --> 00:52:18.969
I <i>am</i> still going to die.
