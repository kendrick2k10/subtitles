[man] You want your money?

11
00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:02.380
You want money?

12
00:03:02.463 --> 00:03:03.338

13
00:03:04.713 --> 00:03:06.338
[grunting and shouting]

14
00:03:07.463 --> 00:03:09.130
Get her. Go get her for me!

15
00:03:09.213 --> 00:03:11.213
Kill her!

16
00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:18.838
We all know about each other.

17
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:21.046
Why don't we make it quick?

18
00:03:27.213 --> 00:03:28.296
[woman] Hurry up!

00:03:28.838 --> 00:03:30.838
All you old bums.
don't bother showing up tomorrow.

20
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.880
You work like shit.
yet keep coming asking for money.

21
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.963
Hey. Fatty. so fat that you can't walk?

22
00:03:48.338 --> 00:03:50.505
Hey. Where is the rest of it?

23
00:03:52.088 --> 00:03:54.505
Bay Ro and Chin Gia haven't paid yet.
I'll go collect tomorrow.

24
00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:56.213
It's the fourth time you failed
your quota.

25
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.380
Can you handle it? If you can't.
I'll have another take care of it.

26
00:04:00.213 --> 00:04:02.338
-Ut Det. Come here.
-Yes. ma'am.

27
00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:06.296
See him?

28
00:04:07.838 --> 00:04:08.671
I can do it.

29
00:04:09.463 --> 00:04:11.338
-Just kidding. Take a hike. cripple.
-Yes. ma'am.

30
00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:14.171
That damn Bay Thot.
he really talked you up.

31
00:04:14.255 --> 00:04:16.005
What did he say?
What did you do in Saigon?

32
00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:19.213
Took money protection at a restaurant?
Hustled at a bar?

33
00:04:19.296 --> 00:04:20.963
You came here.
you can't even get a job done

34
00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:23.171
collecting a few bucks from big farmers?

35
00:04:26.213 --> 00:04:28.338
Give me my pay.
I'll get the rest tomorrow.

36
00:04:29.505 --> 00:04:31.421
Still asking for payment
while you work like shit.

37
00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:32.630
[scoffs]

38
00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:39.755
There. It's yours.

39
00:04:40.671 --> 00:04:41.505
Take it.

40
00:04:42.088 --> 00:04:43.463
Be on time tomorrow. Mm.

41
00:04:47.213 --> 00:04:50.921
Hurry up. What are you looking at?
Hey. you dog. what are you doing?

42
00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:54.505
Sell your house and compensate me.
What are you looking at me for?

43
00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:57.380
You little piece of...

44
00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:16.838
-[woman] What are you buying?
-The usual. miss.

45
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:18.796
Pork. same as usual?

46
00:05:21.338 --> 00:05:23.255
Mai looks so grown-up these days.

47
00:05:25.296 --> 00:05:26.421
That's 30.000 dongs.

48
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.380
[woman 1] That woman is so weird.

49
00:05:32.463 --> 00:05:36.588
[woman 2] Let her be. just the way she is.

50
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.630
[woman 1] Where did she come from anyway?

51
00:05:39.713 --> 00:05:42.880
[woman 2] She came here alone.
raised her kid by herself.

52
00:05:42.963 --> 00:05:44.796
No one knows who the dad is.

53
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.588
Oh. my God. She's a bitch.
A bitch can never find a husband.

54
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:51.838
[woman 2] Don't say that.
We're not in her shoes.

55
00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:53.713
I kind of feel sorry for her.

56
00:05:53.796 --> 00:05:55.296
[man] Please. I'll pay you later.

57
00:05:57.546 --> 00:06:01.671
Listen. in this market. without me.
you won't be able to earn anything.

58
00:06:02.088 --> 00:06:04.588
-When will you give me money?
-I'll pay you when I have money.

59
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:06.255
[man yelps. then pants]

60
00:06:07.588 --> 00:06:10.130
I'll give you one more day.
If you can't make it. get lost.

61
00:06:39.588 --> 00:06:40.963
Hey!

62
00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:43.630
Where do you think you're going?

63
00:06:43.713 --> 00:06:45.796
Guys. search her bag. Give me your bag.

64
00:06:47.713 --> 00:06:49.505
Dump everything out.

65
00:06:50.463 --> 00:06:52.338
Nothing in here.

66
00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:55.338
-Hit her. guys.
-Get her. Take this!

67
00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:56.296
Hit her.

68
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.046
Beat her up.

69
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.713
Who do you think you are?
You bastard. You bastard child.

70
00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.171
-Am I right. guys?
-Mai.

71
00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:07.213
What are you doing. little punks?

72
00:07:07.296 --> 00:07:09.713
Why don't you go home after school?
What are you doing here?

73
00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:11.130
[boy] You dumb hustler.

74
00:07:11.213 --> 00:07:12.880
You debt collector.

75
00:07:12.963 --> 00:07:14.255
What are you gonna do to me?

76
00:07:14.546 --> 00:07:15.671
[woman] You little shit.

77
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.713
-Are you okay. Mai?
-Yes. I am.

78
00:07:25.213 --> 00:07:27.921
Can't believe these kids.
A bunch of devils.

79
00:07:29.505 --> 00:07:31.171
You went to collect debt again?

80
00:07:31.255 --> 00:07:32.088
Nope.

81
00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:34.588
Your hand is injured.

82
00:07:38.255 --> 00:07:40.088
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

FISH FARMING PLAN

84
00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:12.963
The rice is burnt.

85
00:10:13.755 --> 00:10:15.505
Mom. the rice is burnt!

86
00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:20.588
[yelps]

87
00:10:21.046 --> 00:10:23.005
Are you okay. Mom? Be careful.

88
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.713
What are you doing here?

89
00:10:25.796 --> 00:10:27.546
Go do your homework.
Let me take care of it.

90
00:10:28.255 --> 00:10:29.130
Hurry up!

91
00:10:45.963 --> 00:10:46.796
Here.

92
00:10:48.296 --> 00:10:49.130
Here.

93
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:51.088
It's your favorite.

94
00:10:52.755 --> 00:10:53.588
Mom.

95
00:10:54.005 --> 00:10:55.546
I don't think it's done.

96
00:10:56.338 --> 00:10:59.630
Needs a little more cooking.

97
00:11:00.338 --> 00:11:01.171
Eat it anyway.

98
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:23.171
[Mai] Here.

99
00:11:24.046 --> 00:11:24.963
Where'd you buy it?

100
00:11:25.546 --> 00:11:27.671
What? I didn't buy it.

101
00:11:28.963 --> 00:11:30.130
I cooked it.

102
00:11:32.005 --> 00:11:32.921
You little show-off.

103
00:11:33.963 --> 00:11:37.046
Done your homework yet?
You're taking exams this year.

104
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.588
Even if I haven't done my homework.
you think I can ask for your help?

105
00:11:44.963 --> 00:11:49.255
-Eat. Mom. I'll tell you something.
-[footsteps approaching]

106
00:11:51.671 --> 00:11:52.921
[man] Hai Phuong!

107
00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:54.630
You bitch!

108
00:11:55.713 --> 00:11:56.588
Come out here!

109
00:11:57.255 --> 00:11:59.255
Where are you?

110
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:02.838
Come out here! I'll break your legs!

111
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:03.963
My brother.

112
00:12:04.296 --> 00:12:08.755
he just owes you some money.
and you broke his legs!

113
00:12:09.005 --> 00:12:10.505
I dare you to come out here!

114
00:12:10.588 --> 00:12:12.338
I'll fucking break you!

115
00:12:13.505 --> 00:12:14.588
Where are you?

116
00:12:15.921 --> 00:12:19.630
Come out here. Come out! Where are you?

117
00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:21.713
You bitch.

118
00:12:22.463 --> 00:12:23.546
Come out here!

119
00:12:24.338 --> 00:12:26.421
You're hiding. Fine.

120
00:12:26.505 --> 00:12:29.338
When I come back.
I'll burn your house down!

121
00:12:29.421 --> 00:12:30.630
Bitch!

122
00:12:49.671 --> 00:12:50.505
Hey.

123
00:12:51.213 --> 00:12:52.255
Be brave.

124
00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:55.713
Even if you're scared.
you still have to be brave.

125
00:12:56.338 --> 00:12:58.380
Because being scared won't help you.

126
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.171
It's just a feeling.

127
00:13:00.255 --> 00:13:01.505
That man back there.

128
00:13:01.921 --> 00:13:02.880
he's real.

129
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.171
So. you can't be scared. okay?

130
00:13:07.671 --> 00:13:08.546
Let's go eat.

131
00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:26.755
Let's eat.

132
00:13:29.463 --> 00:13:31.963
Braised fish with pineapple?

133
00:13:33.338 --> 00:13:34.505
Let's try some of this.

134
00:13:38.755 --> 00:13:39.671
Pretty good.

135
00:13:40.296 --> 00:13:42.255
I picked it up at An Binh Island.

136
00:13:42.963 --> 00:13:45.005
Why were you there? You skipped class?

137
00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:47.463
Mom. yesterday was Sunday.

138
00:13:49.713 --> 00:13:52.796
You don't ever finish your homework.
always out playing somewhere.

139
00:13:53.338 --> 00:13:54.588
You wanna end up like me?

140
00:14:00.255 --> 00:14:01.838
Where'd you get money for fish?

141
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.963
Aunt Sau Luc gave me some.

142
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.171
She said you let her debt go a few times.

143
00:14:12.755 --> 00:14:14.255
Her house was so worthless.

144
00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:16.255
Nothing worth a damn for me to take.

145
00:14:17.046 --> 00:14:18.213
Keep it if she gave it to you.

146
00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:23.505
Mom. she wants me to watch her raft.

147
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:26.380
-"Chap ba."
-What's that?

148
00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:29.880
She wants me to patch her fish net.
Plus...

149
00:14:31.713 --> 00:14:33.713
if I have 2 million to buy fish fries.

150
00:14:33.796 --> 00:14:36.588
she'll make a fish cage.
I can use her boat.

151
00:14:36.963 --> 00:14:40.921
-I can make 5 million dongs per month.
-Okay. young lady.

152
00:14:41.338 --> 00:14:43.796
Do me a favor and focus on studying.

153
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.921
Keep talking about "chap ba."
Did she cast a spell on you?

154
00:14:47.463 --> 00:14:48.713
But I'm fed up with studying.

155
00:14:51.463 --> 00:14:53.630
They keep hitting and cursing me.

156
00:14:54.213 --> 00:14:56.671
That "You bastard!" "You debt collector!"

157
00:14:57.005 --> 00:14:58.880
I've heard it enough.
and I'm getting an earache.

158
00:15:02.671 --> 00:15:03.963
Mom. let's farm fish.

159
00:15:04.505 --> 00:15:06.255
I don't need to go to school.

160
00:15:07.421 --> 00:15:09.880
I'll help you. I don't mind hard work.

161
00:15:10.463 --> 00:15:12.588
As long as you stop hustling.
stop collecting debts.

162
00:15:12.671 --> 00:15:15.171
I can deal with anything.

163
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:21.755
Look at yourself.
How many days do you think you'd last?

164
00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:25.130
Why do you care.
as long as I can afford your school?

165
00:15:25.213 --> 00:15:27.005
I don't wanna live off of debt collecting.

166
00:15:41.588 --> 00:15:43.088
Brush your teeth before bed!

167
00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:03.630
[retching noises]

168
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.213
Boss.

169
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:22.338
you should see a doctor right away.
Or else you'll have to get an abortion.

170
00:17:23.546 --> 00:17:26.713
Those dogs out there.
they're only afraid of you. Hai Phuong.

171
00:17:29.713 --> 00:17:30.546
Cheers.

172
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.630
[techno music playing over speakers]

173
00:17:38.713 --> 00:17:39.588
[Hai Phuong] Sau Banh.

174
00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:42.921
Rules are: If you're game.
then stick around.

175
00:17:43.505 --> 00:17:45.838
If you can't play fair. get lost.

176
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:48.671
Remember my face. Hai Phuong!
What are you doing? Let me go.

177
00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:49.755
Let me go!

178
00:17:49.838 --> 00:17:52.463
Nothing to see. guys. Everything's fine.

179
00:17:53.088 --> 00:17:54.213
Hey. let's start spinning.

180
00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.671
[Hai Phuong] <i>Any sacrifice is painful.</i>

181
00:18:03.046 --> 00:18:04.796
<i>It's what we sacrifice for that matters.</i>

182
00:18:54.963 --> 00:18:57.755
You really did some tricks to get
this pair of earrings. didn't you?

183
00:18:58.713 --> 00:19:01.213
You can pawn it for 1 million dongs.
interest is 350.000 dongs.

184
00:19:02.546 --> 00:19:03.421
[Mai] Thank you. sir.

185
00:19:04.213 --> 00:19:06.671
-I need 2 million.
-Go to Saigon. then.

186
00:19:06.755 --> 00:19:08.963
How do you think you can get 2 million
for this trash?

187
00:19:09.046 --> 00:19:10.588
I'm old. not stupid.

188
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:13.213
If you're so strapped for cash.
why do you wanna pawn it so bad?

189
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.713
[groans]

190
00:19:14.796 --> 00:19:16.796
It's for Mai to start a fish farm.

191
00:19:17.755 --> 00:19:19.130
Let me think about it.

192
00:19:21.338 --> 00:19:24.046
This stone is of the lowest quality.

193
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.296
The smaller ones. what can I do with them?

194
00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.671
-Eat them with rice?
-[Mai] Mom!

195
00:19:27.755 --> 00:19:29.380
[woman] I caught a thief. everyone.

196
00:19:29.463 --> 00:19:31.213
Hey. what are you doing?

197
00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.421
-She's just a kid.
-She's a thief.

198
00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:36.463
Here. look. Here's the proof.
You can't deny it.

199
00:19:36.546 --> 00:19:38.505
Mai. where did you get the wallet?

200
00:19:39.088 --> 00:19:40.796
I picked it up off the ground.

201
00:19:41.255 --> 00:19:43.546
So convenient for you? It's mine.

202
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.296
There. see?

203
00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:47.755
Lucky me. everything's still here.

204
00:19:47.838 --> 00:19:52.546
You're just a kid and you steal already?
It's how your teacher taught you to act?

205
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:56.338
-See that?
-Mai. tell me? Did you steal it?

206
00:19:56.755 --> 00:19:58.921
No. I didn't. I picked it up.

207
00:19:59.213 --> 00:20:00.296
You have to trust me.

208
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:01.963
You have to trust me.

209
00:20:02.255 --> 00:20:05.171
See. guys?
Don't ever feel sorry for these hustlers.

210
00:20:05.255 --> 00:20:07.505
Here. Check her pockets.
see if there's anything else.

211
00:20:07.588 --> 00:20:08.963
-Give it back to her.
-That's right.

212
00:20:09.046 --> 00:20:10.255
Teach her how to behave.

213
00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:11.796
Or else take her to the police.

214
00:20:12.171 --> 00:20:13.005
Yeah. that's right.

215
00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:16.505
-What kind of mother are you?
-If it were me. I'd call the cops.

216
00:20:16.588 --> 00:20:18.963
Take her to the police.

217
00:20:19.046 --> 00:20:20.588
So stubborn. she won't even admit it.

218
00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.255
Should be ashamed of herself.

219
00:20:24.588 --> 00:20:25.963
Mai. show me your pockets.

220
00:20:26.046 --> 00:20:26.921
No.

221
00:20:27.505 --> 00:20:28.588
I didn't steal it.

222
00:20:29.755 --> 00:20:31.796
Why don't you trust me.
you trust these strangers?

223
00:20:35.255 --> 00:20:36.421
I hate you!

224
00:20:36.505 --> 00:20:37.421
Mai!

225
00:20:38.296 --> 00:20:39.713
-Mai!
-This kid even talks back to her mom.

226
00:20:39.796 --> 00:20:41.171
She's young to be so disrespectful.

227
00:20:41.255 --> 00:20:42.755
See if she took anything.

228
00:20:43.838 --> 00:20:45.255
Wait.

229
00:20:45.338 --> 00:20:47.255
You think you're so smart?

230
00:20:47.838 --> 00:20:50.463
I brought that wallet and went to buy
some wine.

231
00:20:50.546 --> 00:20:52.755
Didn't know I'd dropped it.
Mai picked it up for me.

232
00:20:53.421 --> 00:20:55.255
Before I got a chance to say anything...

233
00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:57.671
-You're drunk. go home.
-I'm not drunk.

234
00:21:00.338 --> 00:21:03.671
Turns out we were wrong about that kid.

235
00:21:39.838 --> 00:21:41.838
Hey. 1.5 million dongs. okay?

236
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:44.838
I'm really doing you a favor here.

237
00:21:44.921 --> 00:21:47.838
Honestly. I would never give anyone else
this price.

238
00:21:47.921 --> 00:21:49.671
So tough to do business in this market.

239
00:21:50.796 --> 00:21:51.838
I'll write you the receipt.

240
00:21:56.505 --> 00:21:57.546
[man] Hey. kid.

241
00:22:01.171 --> 00:22:02.380
-I'm not pawning it.
-What?

242
00:22:03.421 --> 00:22:06.671
Maybe I should move to Saigon.

243
00:22:11.255 --> 00:22:12.088
Mai.

244
00:22:16.713 --> 00:22:18.421
-[Mai] Let me go.
-Mai.

245
00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:19.963

[Mai] Let me go.

247
00:22:22.171 --> 00:22:23.046

248
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:24.838
-I don't wanna go.
-Mai.

249
00:22:27.005 --> 00:22:29.005
-I know your parents.
-Let me go.

250
00:22:29.588 --> 00:22:30.588

[pop music playing over speakers]

271
00:25:39.588 --> 00:25:41.255
Where the hell did she come from?

272
00:25:41.338 --> 00:25:42.255
Which way to the river?

273
00:25:42.338 --> 00:25:43.546
That way.

274
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.671

280
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.755
Where did they take my kid?

281
00:27:31.213 --> 00:27:32.296
Say it!

283
00:28:09.296 --> 00:28:12.505
Hello. did you see a little girl

Do you know where that bus is going?

00:29:37.255 --> 00:29:40.338
I'm not sure.
but they all seem to head to Saigon.

298
00:29:40.421 --> 00:29:43.213
There are others going to Saigon.

299
00:29:43.296 --> 00:29:46.421
That's right. You should ask them.

300
00:29:59.546 --> 00:30:00.505
[Hai Phuong] Sir.

301
00:30:02.171 --> 00:30:05.296

[horn honking]

305
00:30:19.296 --> 00:30:20.963
You wanna die? Go somewhere else to do it.

306
00:30:21.046 --> 00:30:24.921
No. Are you going to Saigon?
Can I get a lift?

307
00:30:25.005 --> 00:30:27.046
This is a cargo truck. not for passengers.
Go away.

308
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.838
No. please.

309

Who do you think you are?
You bastard child! Bastard!

318

I'm starting to get an earache.

319
00:31:24.505 --> 00:31:27.171
No. I didn't steal it. Why do you trust
these strangers? Trust me.

320
00:31:27.255 --> 00:31:29.421
I don't want to live off

Hai Phuong?

327
00:33:16.838 --> 00:33:19.130
What hole did you crawl out from?

328
00:33:19.713 --> 00:33:22.546
[Hai Phuong] Mai was kidnapped.
Get Hung Lua to ask around...

329
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:26.088
He's been in jail for a while.

330
00:33:27.046 --> 00:33:27.921
Drink up.

331
00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:31.755
It's been a decade.

332
00:33:32.296 --> 00:33:34.213
I'm not your bitch anymore.

333
00:33:35.505 --> 00:33:36.505
If your kid was taken.

334
00:33:37.505 --> 00:33:38.880
report it to the police.

335
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.546
You got straw for brains?
Did you forget all the rules?

336
00:33:43.963 --> 00:33:45.755
Plus. I'm the boss now.

337
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.380
I gotta take care of my own people.

338
00:33:51.671 --> 00:33:52.713
Help me out.

339
00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:54.796

346
00:34:14.171 --> 00:34:17.755
She shot up the ranks
the moment she got here.

347
00:34:17.838 --> 00:34:18.921
She even threatened Nam Ro.

348
00:34:20.005 --> 00:34:21.963
Do you know why she's called Thanh Soi?

349
00:34:24.838 --> 00:34:26.755
She's both mean and smart.

350
00:34:29.671 --> 00:34:31.505
Please go back to your country life.

351
00:34:31.921 --> 00:34:33.880

356
00:34:58.671 --> 00:34:59.671
Carry on.

357
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.755
-Born on November 30th. 2008. in...
-Slow down. sis.

358
00:35:04.838 --> 00:35:08.713
It's dangerous if I get the details wrong.
the cops will nab the wrong person.

359
00:35:08.796 --> 00:35:12.838
But every second might cost
my child's life. You know that?

360
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:14.421
You need to remain calm.

361
00:35:14.505 --> 00:35:16.338
I have to be clear.

362
00:35:16.755 --> 00:35:19.005
so Boss Luong can look for your kid.

363
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.046
Look.

364
00:35:25.546 --> 00:35:28.421
Don't worry. My boss is very decorated.

365
00:35:28.505 --> 00:35:33.838
You probably remember
the Saigon-Hai Phong drug case in 2009?

366
00:35:34.755 --> 00:35:37.463
My boss. Luong. solved that one
on his own.

367
00:35:37.755 --> 00:35:41.213
Right after graduation.
he volunteered to be an investigator.

368
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:45.046
And in only a few years.
solved several major cases.

369
00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.546
Then he became lead detective.

370
00:35:47.838 --> 00:35:52.796
Not to mention smaller cases
like murder and robbery.

371
00:35:53.546 --> 00:35:55.255
He can close any case.

372
00:35:55.338 --> 00:36:00.046
So. be assured we'll find Le Hyunh Thi Mai

373
00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.088

Give me more time. sir.

390
00:38:26.088 --> 00:38:29.255
If we make a move on them now.
we'd only wake a sleeping dog.

391
00:38:31.546 --> 00:38:35.838
I understand. But we need to put a stop
to the ring to assure people.

There was a girl kidnapped in Tra Vinh.
Her mom is in the waiting room.

395

The girl's age fits
the case we're working on.

396
00:38:57.463 --> 00:38:58.921
The mother looks really stressed out.

397

I'll call GrabFood for you.

You only have a few hours.

459
00:45:14.755 --> 00:45:16.296
There are operating rooms in the trucks.

460
00:45:16.796 --> 00:45:20.005
Once they reach the train yard.
you'll never see the kid again.

00:45:44.671 --> 00:45:46.796
<i>Then they move to trucks</i>
<i>at the Quy Nhon port.</i>

467
00:46:23.546 --> 00:46:24.671

471
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:52.796
Seems like we only see each other
late at night.

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.421
What'd you come for?

473
00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:01.546
Isn't this too much torque
for a Honda Wave?

474
00:47:03.838 --> 00:47:05.005
You know your shit.

475
00:47:06.463 --> 00:47:09.630
This motorbike used to be tricked out.
not so much anymore.

476
00:47:13.171 --> 00:47:14.046
What about these?

477
00:47:15.713 --> 00:47:17.088
Those belong to the Suzuki sport.

478
00:47:18.255 --> 00:47:19.338
Where's it now?

479
00:47:25.546 --> 00:47:27.880
You ever heard a story
about the tiger hunter?

480
00:47:27.963 --> 00:47:28.921
[chuckles]

481
00:47:30.588 --> 00:47:33.213
There was a guy who hunted tigers
in U Minh jungle.

482
00:47:34.046 --> 00:47:35.255
He told a lot of great stories.

483
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:39.546
Usually they only go after male tigers
and avoid females.

484
00:47:39.921 --> 00:47:41.838
especially when they guard their cubs.

485
00:47:42.546 --> 00:47:45.463
Female tigers. when their cubs are hungry.
can get very aggressive.

486
00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.880
They don't care about anything
but hunting for food.

487
00:47:52.255 --> 00:47:55.130
Sometimes. hunters track down the lair.
with all the cubs.

488
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:59.380
Hunters could easily take them all.
but they're wise enough not to do so.

489
00:48:00.088 --> 00:48:01.005
Do you know why?

490
00:48:07.505 --> 00:48:10.005
Never mess with a tigress guarding
her cubs.

491
00:48:14.171 --> 00:48:16.755
<i>She won't forget it for the rest</i>
<i>of her life.</i>

<i>She'll go to the end of the world...</i>

493
00:48:26.046 --> 00:48:28.546
<i>just to kill the poor fucking bastard</i>
<i>that took her cubs.</i>

498

00:49:06.546 --> 00:49:07.463

This shipment is huge.

513

It's an international operation. trailing
from the Hai Van Pass to Ca Mau Province.

the whole operation.

Why did you follow me?

739
01:08:50.296 --> 01:08:53.421
Because I know that a train left Saigon
ten minutes ago.
