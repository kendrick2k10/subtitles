-Mathias?

186
00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:20.506
Yeah.

187
00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:23.047
You don't think...

188
00:12:24.017 --> 00:12:27.348
Nah. Nah. I'm overthinkin' it.

189
00:12:27.383 --> 00:12:28.514
You guys are good now. right?

190
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.319
We are.

191
00:12:31.354 --> 00:12:33.860
You know. I'd be the first one
to tell it like it is.

192
00:12:33.895 --> 00:12:36.929
-I do know that.
-I go hard for my tribe.

193
00:12:38.262 --> 00:12:40.460
He was by your side
while you were away. right?

194
00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:44.332
-Yeah.
-Then men are stupid.

195
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:46.334
Chalk it up to that.

196
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.105
That I can do.

197
00:13:05.454 --> 00:13:07.553
All right. Joe. y'all
come right back over here.

198
00:13:07.588 --> 00:13:09.159
Hey. big man.
be careful with that. man.

199
00:13:09.194 --> 00:13:10.589
That's professional
grade equipment.

200
00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:12.162
-You got this. you good?
-Yes. sir.

201
00:13:12.967 --> 00:13:14.329
I don't know.

202
00:13:14.364 --> 00:13:15.528
It's got some AARP...

203
00:13:18.566 --> 00:13:20.038
Are you serious right now?

204
00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:22.007
Am I serious?

205
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.108
Y-- yeah.

206
00:13:24.143 --> 00:13:25.241
I come home
to people shuffling things

207
00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:26.979
in and out of the house.

208
00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:28.244
What the hell
is going on?

209
00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:29.575
I'm renovating my studio.

210
00:13:30.952 --> 00:13:33.084
You don't have a studio.

211
00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:35.185
You know the basement's
where I work on my music.

212
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.318
I'm just making it official.

213
00:13:37.618 --> 00:13:39.860
How much
is all of this going to cost?

214
00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:42.390
I-- I don't understand
what the big deal is.

215
00:13:42.425 --> 00:13:43.996
We can afford it now.

216
00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:46.064
When my album comes out.
it'll pay for itself

217
00:13:46.099 --> 00:13:47.659
with interest.

218
00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:50.398
The album you've been working
on for the past 10 years?

219
00:13:50.433 --> 00:13:52.103
That's the album
that's going to cover this?

220
00:13:54.206 --> 00:13:55.304
Wow.

221
00:13:58.012 --> 00:13:59.308
I didn't
mean it like that.

222
00:13:59.343 --> 00:14:00.441
Wow.

223
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.950
I just meant
that we should be smart.

224
00:14:03.985 --> 00:14:05.446
And investing
in me isn't smart?

225
00:14:05.481 --> 00:14:06.612
No!

226
00:14:06.647 --> 00:14:08.383
Yes. It is.

227
00:14:08.418 --> 00:14:09.483
I just--

228
00:14:10.123 --> 00:14:11.221
I wish
that we could talk about

229
00:14:11.256 --> 00:14:12.519
this kind of
stuff first.

230
00:14:13.192 --> 00:14:14.257
Yes. ma'am.

231
00:14:15.194 --> 00:14:16.622
Is it okay
if I go back inside now?

232
00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:18.096
Mathias.

233
00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:21.902
Do you want me
to send it back?

234
00:14:24.467 --> 00:14:25.565
No.

237
00:15:10.645 --> 00:15:12.084
Look who's back.

Yeah. He's back there.

You know. my office

with you comin' by today.

244
00:15:25.462 --> 00:15:27.297
I saw
a few people on my way in.

Good. good.

246
00:15:29.202 --> 00:15:30.267
Well. you look rested.

-Do I?
-Yeah.

248
00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:34.106
I'll take it.

249
00:15:34.636 --> 00:15:36.108
I'm glad
to see the office

250
00:15:36.143 --> 00:15:37.736
is still functioning
in my absence.

251
00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:40.145
You know.
we're about this close

252
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.609
to ruin without you
but we're survivin'. you know?

253
00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:46.019
So come on.
to what do I owe the pleasure?

254
00:15:46.054 --> 00:15:48.351
I am ready.

255
00:15:49.057 --> 00:15:51.255
I am ready
to come back to work.

256
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.322
So soon?

257
00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:55.622
Yeah. I mean.
I still have my job. right?

258
00:15:55.657 --> 00:15:57.690
Of course. come on. you know.
we'd love to have you back.

259
00:15:57.725 --> 00:16:00.066
Then welcome back?

260
00:16:00.497 --> 00:16:02.530
Well. we offered you
a year sabbatical.

261
00:16:02.565 --> 00:16:04.037
It's only been
a couple months.

262
00:16:04.072 --> 00:16:05.269
You sure you
don't want to take the time?

263
00:16:05.634 --> 00:16:07.271
I am sure.

264
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.409
Okay.

265
00:16:13.444 --> 00:16:16.280
So I'm flirtin' with bein'
a little out of line here.

266
00:16:16.744 --> 00:16:19.547
But the hospital
and your father.

267
00:16:20.682 --> 00:16:22.319
Come on. Brooke.

268
00:16:22.354 --> 00:16:24.156
that would take
its toll on the best of us.

269
00:16:24.554 --> 00:16:26.290
I need to
feel useful again.

270
00:16:32.397 --> 00:16:33.726
What do you mean?

271
00:16:33.761 --> 00:16:36.168
I'm starting back up
at the firm again.

272
00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:38.170
I thought
you were on sabbatical.

273
00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:41.173
Well. I asked them
if I can come back

274
00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:42.273
and they said yes.

275
00:16:42.308 --> 00:16:43.406
Wait. you asked them?

276
00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:46.211
-Yes.
-I thought the stress of life.

277
00:16:46.246 --> 00:16:47.377
your father
being sick and work

278
00:16:47.412 --> 00:16:48.774
was what started
this whole thing.

279
00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:50.347
Well. I can't
just hide forever.

280
00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:52.217
I need to
get back to my life.

281
00:16:52.252 --> 00:16:53.317
No.

282
00:16:55.288 --> 00:16:57.321
I really need
your support on this.

283
00:16:57.356 --> 00:16:58.652
Brooke. no.

284
00:16:58.687 --> 00:17:00.291
I love you. Mathias.

285
00:17:00.755 --> 00:17:02.788
But I am not
asking for your permission.

286
00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:04.229
I said no.

287
00:17:04.264 --> 00:17:05.725
You don't earn. Mathias.

288
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.529
Don't make this about me.

289
00:17:07.564 --> 00:17:09.465
When you were in the hospital
who was there for you?

290
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.236
-Me.
-And because I couldn't work.

291
00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:12.798
we were
behind on the bills.

292
00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:14.536
-We were behind on mortgage.
-Well. we're not anymore.

293
00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:17.275
Yeah. and my father only had
to die for it to happen.

294
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.145
What do you want me
to say to that. Brooke. huh?

295
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.641
Money is king with you.

296
00:17:20.676 --> 00:17:22.280
But is money the only thing
that's gonna make you happy?

297
00:17:23.745 --> 00:17:24.810
No.

298
00:17:27.716 --> 00:17:29.221
Brooke.

299
00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:30.354
You're not ready.

300
00:17:33.194 --> 00:17:35.425
I start back on Monday

301
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.493
whether you think
I'm mentally fit or not.

302
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.906
Wanna get it
between. like. April or March.

303
00:17:54.941 --> 00:17:56.875
Oh. March?
My birthday is March.

304
00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:06.753
Good to
have you back. Brooke.

305
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.694
Sometimes I wish
I never got it.

306
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.235
The inheritance?

307
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.434
Yeah.

308
00:18:17.469 --> 00:18:19.304
It was a gift
from your father.

309
00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:20.899
If I didn't get the money.

310
00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:22.736
that means
he'd still be alive

311
00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:25.211
and I wouldn't be here.

312
00:18:25.246 --> 00:18:27.147
Well. come on.
I mean. you know what they say.

313
00:18:27.809 --> 00:18:29.314
Money is the answer

314
00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:32.251
to 99
out of 100 questions.

315
00:18:32.286 --> 00:18:33.747
But see.
that's why we should be sure

316
00:18:33.782 --> 00:18:37.190
that we're asking
the right question.

317
00:18:38.292 --> 00:18:39.885
I don't follow.

318
00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.491
Is it money?

319
00:18:42.494 --> 00:18:43.592
Or your husband?

320
00:18:46.366 --> 00:18:47.662
Money is a tricky one.

321
00:18:48.731 --> 00:18:51.468
-Yeah.
-Your friend. Kendra.

322
00:18:51.503 --> 00:18:53.338
the one we spoke about
last session.

323
00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:56.242
You've never had
issues with her and money?

324
00:18:56.277 --> 00:18:58.838
No. I mean. well. I lent her
money a few years ago

325
00:18:58.873 --> 00:19:00.213
but she paid it
right back.

326
00:19:00.248 --> 00:19:01.907
Then. why did you
bring it up?

327
00:19:02.613 --> 00:19:04.679
Well. she paid most of it back.

328
00:19:04.714 --> 00:19:05.845
But she was
in between jobs.

329
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.484
And I said
it was a gift

330
00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:09.486
and she still
insisted on paying it back.

331
00:19:09.521 --> 00:19:10.619
Hmm.

332
00:19:11.391 --> 00:19:12.753
I see.

333
00:19:12.788 --> 00:19:14.821
We have
a good relationship.

334
00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.427
I'm sure you do.

335
00:19:37.945 --> 00:19:39.384
Mm.

336
00:20:12.452 --> 00:20:13.517
What are you doing up?

337
00:20:15.356 --> 00:20:16.949
-I thought I heard somethin'.
-Sorry.

338
00:20:17.622 --> 00:20:19.688
Couldn't sleep. Hey.

339
00:20:22.462 --> 00:20:23.725
Sorry.

340
00:21:05.505 --> 00:21:06.570
Construction is on schedule

341
00:21:06.605 --> 00:21:07.934
for the Miller building

342
00:21:07.969 --> 00:21:09.573
and things
seem to be running smoothly.

343
00:21:09.608 --> 00:21:11.707
So there's nothing
to report back on that.

344
00:21:12.072 --> 00:21:13.940
Good. Thanks. James.

345
00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:15.744
So now what else?
What else?

346
00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:17.911
-Visionary Van--
-Ah. Visionary Vanguard. Right.

347
00:21:17.946 --> 00:21:19.484
Uh. Monroe.
are you there?

348
00:21:19.519 --> 00:21:20.848
<i>Yeah. I'm here.</i>

349
00:21:23.083 --> 00:21:25.358
Uh. we're going to
hold for just a second.

350
00:21:27.626 --> 00:21:28.691
<i>Still there?</i>

351
00:21:32.466 --> 00:21:35.401
Uh. yeah-- Yes.
Monroe. are you there?

352
00:21:35.436 --> 00:21:36.732
<i>Yes. ma'am.</i>

353
00:21:36.767 --> 00:21:39.097
Everything seems to be on track

354
00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.638
as far as
the progress

355
00:21:41.673 --> 00:21:42.771
and the. umm--

356
00:21:43.609 --> 00:21:45.070
Everything looks
good to go.

357
00:21:45.105 --> 00:21:47.677
So if anything changes.
I'll contact you.

358
00:21:47.712 --> 00:21:49.514
<i>So does that mean</i>

359
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:50.878
<i>we're moving to construction</i>
<i>next week or what?</i>

360
00:21:50.913 --> 00:21:54.046
Uh. let's-- let-- let--

361
00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:56.554
um. let me verify that

362
00:21:56.589 --> 00:21:59.458
and I'll have an answer
to you within the hour.

363
00:21:59.493 --> 00:22:01.361
<i>Okay. I'll standby.</i>

364
00:22:02.694 --> 00:22:04.397
All right.

365
00:22:04.432 --> 00:22:05.827
Moving on.

366
00:22:10.603 --> 00:22:11.998
Michael.
before you say anything.

367
00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:13.637
I would like to apologize.

368
00:22:13.672 --> 00:22:14.935
There was
an issue with my laptop.

369
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.607
I took it to IT
and they fixed it.

370
00:22:16.642 --> 00:22:18.642
-But I know that is no excuse--
-Brooke. Brooke.

371
00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:20.842
Look.
I'm on your side.

372
00:22:21.845 --> 00:22:23.108
So if you need
a little more time--

373
00:22:23.143 --> 00:22:24.879
No. no.
that was a one-time thing.

374
00:22:25.981 --> 00:22:27.046
All right.

375
00:22:27.752 --> 00:22:28.784
One time.

376
00:22:43.537 --> 00:22:45.130
Don't beat yourself up. Brooke.

377
00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:52.104
Shoot!

378
00:22:58.178 --> 00:23:00.717
Yeah. uh. you know. I--
I know about the transactions.

379
00:23:00.752 --> 00:23:01.817
It's from
my husband's studio.

380
00:23:01.852 --> 00:23:03.214
He's a musician.

381
00:23:03.249 --> 00:23:04.919
That's everyday
checking account stuff.

382
00:23:04.954 --> 00:23:06.151
Not my concern.

383
00:23:06.186 --> 00:23:09.924
There are
inquiries of large sums

384
00:23:09.959 --> 00:23:12.960
and withdrawals
totaling $50.000.

385
00:23:15.602 --> 00:23:16.931
$50.000?

386
00:23:16.966 --> 00:23:18.999
Normally.
I'd make a call. send an email.

387
00:23:19.034 --> 00:23:20.770
making sure you're aware.

388
00:23:20.805 --> 00:23:23.839
But Reggie wants special
attention on your accounts.

389
00:23:25.172 --> 00:23:26.710
Are you making
those inquiries?

390
00:23:26.745 --> 00:23:27.810
The withdraws?

391
00:23:29.583 --> 00:23:31.011
Look.
either you're doing it.

392
00:23:31.915 --> 00:23:33.079
The accounts
have been compromised.

393
00:23:33.114 --> 00:23:35.147
which is unlikely.

394
00:23:35.182 --> 00:23:36.456
or it's your husband.

395
00:23:37.987 --> 00:23:39.052
I'll look into it.

396
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:41.560
Are you
in need of cash?

397
00:23:42.189 --> 00:23:43.925
-Excuse me?
-If you are.

398
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.224
I could release some funds
for your expenditures

399
00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:49.865
and restructure the accounts
making you the sole holder.

400
00:23:50.637 --> 00:23:51.735

401
00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.605
Yes.

403
00:23:56.302 --> 00:23:58.236
Be that as it may.

404
00:23:58.271 --> 00:23:59.710

405
00:23:59.745 --> 00:24:01.646

to all funds.

00:30:53.653 --> 00:30:54.927
No. no. no.

544
00:30:54.962 --> 00:30:56.126
She's here with Devon.

545
00:30:56.161 --> 00:30:58.062
You need to fire her then.

546
00:30:58.097 --> 00:30:59.426
She can't be
all that smart.

547
00:30:59.461 --> 00:31:01.329
I-- I'll be right back.

548
00:31:02.266 --> 00:31:03.364
Wow.

549
00:31:07.403 --> 00:31:08.468
So. uh.

550
00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.668
What's that about?

551
00:31:11.506 --> 00:31:12.978
You know.
it's somethin' I'm workin' on.

552
00:31:13.013 --> 00:31:14.342
She came to me.

553
00:31:14.377 --> 00:31:15.948
I usually
don't like 'em that aggressive.

554
00:31:15.983 --> 00:31:17.444
but somethin' about this
kinda turned me on.

555
00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:20.513
-Not bad at all.
-Uh-uh.

556
00:31:21.648 --> 00:31:23.054
You hit?

557
00:31:23.089 --> 00:31:25.452
All kinds of ways.

558
00:31:26.521 --> 00:31:27.685
Word.

559
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.720
Nah. I'm lyin'.

560
00:31:29.755 --> 00:31:31.458
She's a tough nut
to crack.

561
00:31:31.493 --> 00:31:33.427
herself makin'
me work for it. I guess.

562
00:31:56.353 --> 00:32:01.356
♪

563
00:32:03.657 --> 00:32:04.722
You need help
cleaning up?

564
00:32:04.757 --> 00:32:06.691
Yeah.

565
00:32:06.726 --> 00:32:10.035
Ooh. my.
Would you look at the time.

566
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.235
-I got a thing.
-Yeah. whatever.

567
00:32:14.734 --> 00:32:16.503
Are you going to
make it to class tomorrow?

568
00:32:16.538 --> 00:32:18.274
I don't know...

569
00:32:19.079 --> 00:32:20.342
Please do.

570
00:32:20.377 --> 00:32:22.113
I need to
talk to you about somethin'.

571
00:32:23.083 --> 00:32:24.280
Okay.

572
00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.777
Okay. Bye.

573
00:32:26.812 --> 00:32:28.251
Bye.

574
00:32:28.286 --> 00:32:29.384
Don't stay up too late.

575
00:32:29.419 --> 00:32:30.550
I won't.

576
00:32:36.261 --> 00:32:38.294
Oh. my gosh.

577
00:32:38.329 --> 00:32:39.427
Uh-huh.

578
00:32:40.628 --> 00:32:42.100
You know
I hate to admit it.

579
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.070
-But you were right.
-About what?

580
00:32:45.633 --> 00:32:47.600
-The party?
-Mm-hm.

581
00:32:49.076 --> 00:32:50.207
I tried to tell you.

582
00:32:52.079 --> 00:32:54.244
The proper response
is thank you.

583
00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:55.740
Mm.
What's goin' on with this?

584
00:32:55.775 --> 00:32:57.412
Stop. I'm filthy.

585
00:32:57.447 --> 00:32:59.282
Maybe I like it filthy.

586
00:32:59.317 --> 00:33:02.087
-I can't-- Stop!

587
00:33:02.122 --> 00:33:03.517
Stop. Mathias.

588
00:33:08.095 --> 00:33:09.226
I'm tellin' you.

589
00:33:09.756 --> 00:33:11.360
Something's
not right with her.

590
00:33:11.395 --> 00:33:12.625
You don't even know her.

591
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.330
I know
all I need to know.

592
00:33:14.365 --> 00:33:15.595
Comin' up in there.

593
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.234
poppin' her ass
every which way.

594
00:33:19.106 --> 00:33:20.336
Sorry about the party.

595
00:33:20.371 --> 00:33:22.338
If I knew.
I wouldn't have come.

596
00:33:22.373 --> 00:33:23.471
It was interesting.

597
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.441
Doctor-patient
in social situations

598
00:33:26.476 --> 00:33:28.575
can be very awkward.

599
00:33:29.281 --> 00:33:30.709
How long
have you been seein' her?

600
00:33:30.744 --> 00:33:32.315
Not too long
after I got home.

601
00:33:33.714 --> 00:33:35.153
Needed somebody
to talk to.

602
00:33:36.387 --> 00:33:37.848
You've known her
for a long time?

603
00:33:37.883 --> 00:33:39.289
Since college.

604
00:33:39.324 --> 00:33:40.521
So not that long.

605
00:33:43.196 --> 00:33:45.163
So you knew her
when you met your husband?

606
00:33:45.198 --> 00:33:46.692
Yeah. she introduced us.

607
00:33:46.727 --> 00:33:48.760
Are you
going to keep seeing her?

608
00:33:48.795 --> 00:33:50.432
Why wouldn't I?

609
00:33:50.467 --> 00:33:53.171
-You sure she's straight?
-Excuse you?

610
00:33:53.206 --> 00:33:55.305
I mean. she look
a little tricky to me.

611
00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.768
You would know.

612
00:33:58.211 --> 00:34:00.310
I dabbled one time.

613
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.378
Forgive me.

614
00:34:02.413 --> 00:34:03.709
No. go ahead.

615
00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:06.811
She seems to have
little faith in people.

616
00:34:08.716 --> 00:34:09.847
What kind of therapist

617
00:34:09.882 --> 00:34:12.124
shows up
at a patient's house?

618
00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:13.356
She didn't know.

619
00:34:13.391 --> 00:34:14.753
You sure about that?

620
00:34:14.788 --> 00:34:16.557
You're overreacting.

621
00:34:16.592 --> 00:34:18.757
-Kendra's been hurt.
-We've all been hurt.

622
00:34:18.792 --> 00:34:20.792
We all carry
burden and baggage.

623
00:34:20.827 --> 00:34:22.365
But that
doesn't give us the right

624
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.763
to export that pain
onto other people.

625
00:34:24.798 --> 00:34:26.237
She doesn't.

626
00:34:26.734 --> 00:34:28.701
I'm sure.

627
00:34:28.736 --> 00:34:31.572
What does Mathias
think about all of this?

628
00:34:31.607 --> 00:34:32.804
Why?

629
00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:34.377
Have you
talked to him about it?

630
00:34:34.412 --> 00:34:36.313
Why do you care
what Mathias thinks?

631
00:34:36.348 --> 00:34:37.743
Just...

632
00:34:37.778 --> 00:34:39.349
have you talked?

633
00:34:39.384 --> 00:34:41.219
Married people talk. right?

634
00:34:41.617 --> 00:34:43.386
You have to
protect your borders. Brooke.

635
00:34:43.421 --> 00:34:46.191
Some people actively seek out
another person's life.

636
00:34:47.359 --> 00:34:49.821
Now. they may not be
aware that they're doing it

637
00:34:49.856 --> 00:34:51.889
but they are. nonetheless.

638
00:34:55.961 --> 00:34:58.368
-Talk later?
-Yeah.

639
00:34:58.403 --> 00:35:03.439
♪

640
00:35:27.432 --> 00:35:28.596
All right.
so I'm thinking

641
00:35:28.631 --> 00:35:30.862
a little bit more
modern. um.

642
00:35:30.897 --> 00:35:32.336
maybe
more natural lighting.

643
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.965
-And some harder edges?

644
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.835
Oh.
give me just a moment.

645
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.243
Okay. no problem.

646
00:35:38.278 --> 00:35:39.343
You got a second. Brooke?

647
00:35:39.378 --> 00:35:40.905
-Yeah.
-Okay.

648
00:35:41.908 --> 00:35:43.908
So James
isn't really working out

649
00:35:43.943 --> 00:35:45.316
on the Miller building.

650
00:35:45.351 --> 00:35:46.746
-Mm.
-Mm.

651
00:35:46.781 --> 00:35:49.485
Client's a little
agitated so I told him

652
00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.882
I'll bring
one of my aces to close.

653
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.621
-You want me on it?
-Yeah. is that a problem?

654
00:35:53.656 --> 00:35:55.260
-No!

655
00:35:55.295 --> 00:35:56.525
Okay. good.
Good. So.

656
00:35:57.264 --> 00:35:58.824
Yeah. I'll handle James.

657
00:35:58.859 --> 00:36:00.760
-You know. this is one

658
00:36:00.795 --> 00:36:02.960
of our bigger accounts
and they just a little needy.

659
00:36:02.995 --> 00:36:05.930
But uh. what better way to
get you back up to speed. huh?

660
00:36:05.965 --> 00:36:07.569
-Yeah.
-So I can count on you?

661
00:36:07.604 --> 00:36:09.274
-Yes.
-All right.

662
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:10.539
All right!

663
00:36:25.622 --> 00:36:27.721
Hey. You okay?

664
00:36:29.362 --> 00:36:30.460
What's wrong?

665
00:36:31.496 --> 00:36:32.858
I'm gonna
ask you a question.

666
00:36:33.663 --> 00:36:36.367
Please. don't do
anything but answer it.

667
00:36:37.931 --> 00:36:39.238
Who is he?

668
00:36:40.637 --> 00:36:41.702
Who-- who's who?

669
00:36:44.872 --> 00:36:47.345
The man in the picture.
the man you're with.

670
00:36:47.908 --> 00:36:49.776
-How did you get that?
-Who is he?

671
00:36:50.845 --> 00:36:51.910
He's no one.

672
00:36:51.945 --> 00:36:53.351
You always kiss no one?

673
00:36:53.386 --> 00:36:54.979
It's not
what it looks like.

674
00:36:55.014 --> 00:36:56.453
How did you get that?

675
00:36:56.488 --> 00:36:57.817
You lookin'
at a picture of you

676
00:36:57.852 --> 00:36:59.423
and another man
and your response is.

677
00:36:59.458 --> 00:37:00.853
"How did I get it?"

678
00:37:00.888 --> 00:37:02.723
He is somebody
that I knew from years ago.

679
00:37:04.397 --> 00:37:06.529
We spoke for a moment.

680
00:37:06.564 --> 00:37:08.894
-That's it.
-You forgot kissed.

681
00:37:09.996 --> 00:37:12.271
-It is not--
-What it looks like. I got it.

682
00:37:15.672 --> 00:37:16.869
Why did you
take me back?

683
00:37:18.378 --> 00:37:20.675
Pretend to forgive me.
Put me through hell.

684
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:22.479
You did that to us--

685
00:37:22.514 --> 00:37:23.678
Don't flip this
around on me.

686
00:37:24.945 --> 00:37:26.912
You put me through
all that just to hurt me?

687
00:37:27.948 --> 00:37:29.046
I hope
it was worth it.

688
00:37:29.719 --> 00:37:31.356
Mathias.

689
00:37:33.052 --> 00:37:34.623
You should'a
just let me go.

690
00:37:38.662 --> 00:37:39.892
I'm sorry.

691
00:38:09.891 --> 00:38:12.463
The worst part is I can't get
my mind to stop running.

692
00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:15.125
You know. it's like
one thing gets in there

693
00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.128
and it just keeps
playing over and over again.

694
00:38:18.163 --> 00:38:19.899
And I could not stop it.

695
00:38:20.638 --> 00:38:22.770
You haven't been
given a rest.

696
00:38:22.805 --> 00:38:24.574
You should go
somewhere alone.

697
00:38:24.609 --> 00:38:27.544
But if it's the Caribbean.
I'll go with you.

698
00:38:27.579 --> 00:38:29.139
I'll give you
your space. though.

699
00:38:29.174 --> 00:38:30.679
Sometimes
I feel like the reason

700
00:38:30.714 --> 00:38:31.779
everything's falling apart
is 'cause

701
00:38:31.814 --> 00:38:33.583
I went
to the hospital.

702
00:38:33.618 --> 00:38:35.112
You know what I'm sayin'?
I took my hand off the wheel.

703
00:38:35.147 --> 00:38:37.587
You're putting way
too much pressure on yourself.

704
00:38:37.622 --> 00:38:39.424
No. I should have
been stronger.

705
00:38:39.459 --> 00:38:40.524
Brooke.

706
00:38:40.922 --> 00:38:42.922
First Mathias
cheatin' on you.

707
00:38:42.957 --> 00:38:45.661
then losin' a baby.
then the job.

708
00:38:45.696 --> 00:38:47.663
then your father
getting sick.

709
00:38:47.698 --> 00:38:50.831
And who knows what else
you haven't told me all on you.

710
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.405
It was too much.

711
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.100
It would have been
too much for anyone.

712
00:38:56.938 --> 00:38:58.806
Some days are good.
you know?

713
00:38:59.842 --> 00:39:01.611
Other days
it's just like--

714
00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:06.550
You can
always call me.

715
00:39:07.784 --> 00:39:08.948
I know.

716
00:39:10.017 --> 00:39:11.786
With you
and Natasha's help.

717
00:39:11.821 --> 00:39:13.051
I'mma make it
through this.

718
00:39:13.086 --> 00:39:14.525
Natasha?

719
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.022
-Yeah.
-Why you listenin' to her?

720
00:39:17.057 --> 00:39:18.892
Not this again.

721
00:39:18.927 --> 00:39:21.125
I don't know why you think

Uh. slow down.
What are you talking about?

947
00:52:11.303 --> 00:52:13.303
A letter signed by you.
sent to Reggie

948
00:52:13.338 --> 00:52:16.273
saying I was an obstruction
to your access to funds.

949
00:52:16.308 --> 00:52:19.507
And implying I was siphoning
money from your accounts.

950
00:52:19.542 --> 00:52:20.904

951
00:52:20.939 --> 00:52:22.840

952
00:52:22.875 --> 00:52:25.348
Yeah?
How about you find out who did?

953
00:52:25.383 --> 00:52:26.811
How about
you let me in your office

954
00:52:26.846 --> 00:52:28.780
before I pull
every dime from your care?

955
00:52:33.358 --> 00:52:34.654
Right this way.

956
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.892

about Mathias stealing from me?

958
00:52:46.866 --> 00:52:49.306

you gave him full access.

959
00:52:49.341 --> 00:52:51.209
I can't deny him
what's legally his.

960
00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.837
So what then?

961
00:52:54.874 --> 00:52:57.446
I could put
a freeze on the accounts.

962
00:52:57.481 --> 00:52:58.942
No one. including you.

963
00:52:58.977 --> 00:53:00.449
would have access to them

964
00:53:00.484 --> 00:53:02.319

to restructure

965
00:53:02.354 --> 00:53:04.013
or close them
and open new ones.

966
00:53:04.048 --> 00:53:06.587
But a letter from him
or a lawyer can overturn that.

967
00:53:06.622 --> 00:53:08.985
