00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:40.333
The
National Weather Service

4
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.375
is now calling this
the worst ice storm

5
00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.750
in the State's history.

6
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.250
It could be linked to the
recent asteroid cluster

7
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.208
that passed close to Earth's
orbit just yesterday.

8
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.166
Exterminator.
Exterminator.

9
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Exterminator!

10
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:09.916
Okay.

11
00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:19.916
Hello.
it's Frank. What's up?

12
00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:23.625
There are noises in my walls.
Like an animal.

13
00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.291
Yeah. a-ha. it's
probably rats. ma'am.

14
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.666
I can take care of that for you.
What's your name?

15
00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:31.375
My name is Helga.

16
00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:32.958
Awright. you got
an address for me?

17
00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:38.708
Apartment 4. 114 Cyprus Lane.
South Brooklyn.

18
00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:41.833
114 Cyprus! Haven't
I talked to you before?

19
00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:43.958
Ain't you that lady with the
fucked up parrot?

20
00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.541
I don't own a parrot.

21
00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.000
Okay.
I'll see you soon.

22
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.208
Motherfucker!

23
00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:30.208
Who is it?

24
00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:34.458
It's Frank! The exterminator!
Buzz me up. dammit.

25
00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.416
Buzz?

26
00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:40.000
Yeah! As in press the little
button on the intercom

27
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.666
to buzz me up. Come on.
it's freezing out here.

28
00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:45.708
Oh ya. ya.
Oh wait. I buzz you.

29
00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:47.041
I buzz.

30
00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.375
Goddamn! People
ever hear of an elevator.

31
00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:23.666
You called the Bugbrothers
out to re-do my job?

32
00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:25.458
This is my block.
not the Bugbrothers.

33
00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:26.791
They're not even
actually brothers.

34
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:29.166
they're just two Bulgarian dudes
who met in prison.

35
00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:30.583
They're criminals!

36
00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.291
They'll steal your shit.

37
00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:34.333
And they're recalcitrant!

38
00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:36.083
They didn't even clean your
ducts off properly.

39
00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:37.333
I don't know what the
fuck that mess is

40
00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:39.208
but it smells like shit
and it's disgusting.

41
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.208
Ah. ya...

42
00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:44.250
How can I help you. dear?

43
00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:50.166
Miss Helga. you called about the
noises in your walls. right?

44
00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:52.416
Oh. no. no. no. not me.

45
00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.125
You sure about that?

46
00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:01.875
- There's a noise.
- Yeah.

47
00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:03.500
It's a noise alright.

48
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.625
Is someone back there?

49
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.666
There is noise.

50
00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:33.666
Oh God! No!

51
00:06:57.666 --> 00:06:59.541
Shhh!

52
00:07:11.791 --> 00:07:13.666
Ah. yes. yes. hello dear.

53
00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:19.125

Who is there?

71
00:09:55.541 --> 00:09:58.416
Who's in there?
Is somebody there?

72
00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.083
Coming in!

73
00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:17.750
Ohhh!

74
00:11:12.166 --> 00:11:15.833
That girl is always
breaking things. Always!

75
00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:18.041
There's no way Charlotte
could have done that. Gunter.

76
00:11:18.041 --> 00:11:19.500
The store room's
double padlocked.

77
00:11:20.416 --> 00:11:21.583
You fix that window!

78
00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:23.666
I'm already pretty busy
today. Gunter.

79
00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:26.875
Busy. what?
Drawing your comic books?

80
00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:30.000
I have to see the boiler and ah.
fix Maria's sink.

81
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.750
and the garbage compactor's
blown a fuse again--

82
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.291
Do you like this job?

83
00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:36.333
Ja? You pay no rent.
this is good. ja?

84
00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:37.625
Definitely. yes. yes!

85
00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:40.958
Good! Then you
can fix the window.

86
00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:46.291
Goddammit!

87
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.625
Charlotte!

88
00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:31.708
Charlotte?

89
00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:33.666
Charlotte!

90
00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.833
- Charlotte?
- Hey Ethan. what's up?

91
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.000
- Did you?
- What?

92
00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:44.791
Were you in your
grandma's apartment today?

93
00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:47.250
No. Why?

94
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.958
Well. somebody broke a window
in Gunter's store room.

95
00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:51.958
One of her dolls is missing.

96
00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.000
I don't play with dolls.

97
00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:57.000
I have no interest in
Gunter's dollhouse.

98
00:12:58.125 --> 00:13:00.291
How do you know
it came from a doll's house?

99
00:13:01.916 --> 00:13:03.250
I don't.

100
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:06.833
Uh-huh.

101
00:13:08.708 --> 00:13:11.583
Just stay away from
Gunter for a while. yeah?

102
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.458
I have to take this.

103
00:13:18.833 --> 00:13:19.958
Sandy. hi.

104
00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:22.958
How'd the ads go?

105
00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.875
Ethan!
Great actually.

106
00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:28.291
It's tracking really well. The
team's all super excited.

107
00:13:28.291 --> 00:13:30.958
You're not going to believe this
but Toby wants to move it up

108
00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.750
to one of the bigger release
slots for the summer.

109
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:34.708
Wow!

110
00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:49.291
I know what we're
going to call you.

111
00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:53.208
We're going to call you 'Sting'.

112
00:13:56.916 --> 00:13:57.833
Do you
think you can finish

113
00:13:57.833 --> 00:13:58.875
by the end of the month?

114
00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:01.250
That's...
that's in a week!

115
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.583
I think if we bring in
Alan. he can ink and colour.

116
00:14:04.583 --> 00:14:06.583
as you draw.
then I think it's totally--

117
00:14:06.583 --> 00:14:09.625
No. Sandy. I have
a day job and a baby.

118
00:14:09.625 --> 00:14:11.708
I'm working on this thing nights.

119
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.000
Charlotte!

120
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:29.416
Charlotte!

121
00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:32.083
I need you to watch Liam.

122
00:14:32.083 --> 00:14:33.375
Why?

123
00:14:33.375 --> 00:14:35.541
Because he's six months old
and he eats paper.

124
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.875
Mum! Come on.

125
00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:38.875
I've watched him for like
a thousand hours already.

126
00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:40.375
You watched him for
precisely three minutes

127
00:14:40.375 --> 00:14:41.875
while I was in the bathroom

128
00:14:41.875 --> 00:14:43.958
and I'm not having you lying
around in your room all day.

129
00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.250
It's not healthy.

130
00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:51.166
And can you please
change your attitude?

131
00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:53.750
Yeah. that's better.

132
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.041
Alright. I'll be at my desk.
Knock only if it's an emergency.

133
00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:00.375
You look pale.
Did you eat breakfast?

134
00:15:03.416 --> 00:15:05.500
Banana! Eat it.

135
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.416
I'll be ten. maybe twenty.

136
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.958
Are you okay?

137
00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:15.166
Alright...

138
00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:27.083
You are the bane
of my existence.

139
00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.916
You hungry?

140
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:22.500
Go on. eat it!

141
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.666
Fuck! Fuck!

142
00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:24.083
Cucaracha?

143
00:17:25.375 --> 00:17:26.875
I hate those things.

144
00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:29.083
It's an infestation.

145
00:17:29.083 --> 00:17:35.000
and that puta slumlord up
there. she does nothing!

146
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.958
She's cheap. She's nasty.
creepy. and cheap.

147
00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:43.916
Alright.
I'm all done here.

148
00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:50.583
Oh no! Your poor little pollito!

149
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:52.875
I hope he's okay.

150
00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:54.541
Oh. I'm sure he's fine.

151
00:17:55.125 --> 00:17:56.750
Kid's are basically
made of rubber.

152
00:17:57.208 --> 00:17:59.291
They'll bounce back
from anything.

153
00:18:07.416 --> 00:18:09.000
I'm sorry. Maria. I...

154
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.708
It's okay.

155
00:18:11.666 --> 00:18:13.708
But I'm going to tell you
something. Cabrone.

156
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:19.083
You don't know
how lucky you are.

157
00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:24.750
Now go home. and hug those
beautiful children of yours.

158
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.500
Okay.

159
00:18:51.375 --> 00:18:53.458
That's your feeding whistle.

160
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.375
That means you're hungry.

161
00:19:29.208 --> 00:19:31.083
Cool!

162
00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.833
Damn it!

163
00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:30.208
Alright. here we go.

164
00:20:34.625 --> 00:20:35.625
- Yeah.
- Hi.

165
00:20:35.625 --> 00:20:37.208
Take baby.

166
00:20:39.041 --> 00:20:40.291
How'd it go?

167
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:42.416
I'll tell you later. I gotta go
put Mum to bed.

168
00:20:42.416 --> 00:20:45.416
- Nice to see you. too.
- Love you.

169
00:20:55.208 --> 00:20:56.750
Hey. Mum.

170
00:20:59.666 --> 00:21:00.916
Aunty?

171
00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:05.375
What are you guys watching?

172
00:21:12.708 --> 00:21:14.458
Are you ready for bed. Mum?

173
00:21:20.666 --> 00:21:22.041
Oh!

174
00:21:22.458 --> 00:21:26.500
In the top drawer
there is a wool sweater.

175
00:21:26.833 --> 00:21:29.583
It's for your baby girl.

176
00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:33.500
You made a sweater
for Charlotte?

177
00:21:33.916 --> 00:21:35.500
That's very sweet.

178
00:21:35.958 --> 00:21:37.875
It's for the winter.

179
00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:40.375
It's very cold now.

180
00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:42.125
Hmm. it sure is.

181
00:21:43.791 --> 00:21:46.583
You should meet my daughter.

182
00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:54.583
Yeah. I'd like that.

183
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:10.625
Ew!

184
00:22:38.791 --> 00:22:40.458
Oh. goddammit!

185
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.291
Charlotte! Where's my sharpener?

186
00:22:47.083 --> 00:22:48.833
Charlotte!

187
00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:50.125
Char--

188
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.041
Wait!

189
00:22:53.458 --> 00:22:55.583
I've got some good news for you.

190
00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:57.916
What is it?

191
00:22:57.916 --> 00:23:01.083
Publisher's printing
45.000 extra copies.

192
00:23:01.083 --> 00:23:03.333
Your comic book's going to
become like a mainstream thing.

193
00:23:03.333 --> 00:23:05.958
- Really?
- Yeah. really.

194
00:23:06.291 --> 00:23:07.833
Can I see what
you've done so far?

195
00:23:07.833 --> 00:23:09.375
Well no. I mean
it's still rough and--

196
00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:12.916
Come on! Don't be a lamo.
Let me see.

197
00:23:12.916 --> 00:23:16.375
Okay. come on.
Take a seat.

198
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.375
It's cool.

199
00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:21.166
- Careful of smudges.
- Yeah.

200
00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:25.333
I love how you use
circles for the highlights.

201
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.583
Thank you.

202
00:23:27.916 --> 00:23:30.666
The electricity here
looks really cool.

203
00:23:30.666 --> 00:23:33.333
It's all curved.

204
00:23:34.041 --> 00:23:35.958
Don't you think he
looks too evil though?

205
00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:38.000
I mean. the Professor
character's

206
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.458
kinda based on my dad.
and he's not evil.

207
00:23:41.458 --> 00:23:43.583
Right. where's the pencil. smartarse?

208
00:23:43.583 --> 00:23:45.291
Why don't you show me
how it's done?

209
00:23:48.541 --> 00:23:50.750
I'd add eyes under the glasses.

210
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:53.833
so you can see more emotion.
you know?

211
00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:56.375
When did you become
such a pro?

212
00:23:57.958 --> 00:23:59.041
I'm just naturally gifted.

213
00:23:59.041 --> 00:24:00.625
Hey. you two.

214
00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:04.083
It's time for dinner. Do you
want to set the table Shahshah?

215
00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:12.916
That was a nice little moment.

216
00:24:13.708 --> 00:24:15.458
Thank you. I needed that.

217
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:22.375
You're so beautiful.

218
00:24:25.916 --> 00:24:29.416
You are so beautiful!

219
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.833
This is
my English story!

220
00:24:34.833 --> 00:24:36.291
I'm so confused.

221
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:38.708
This is my
English story. I wrote it.

222
00:24:38.708 --> 00:24:41.250
- You wrote it?
- Yes. I wrote this.

223
00:25:36.875 --> 00:25:38.458
Charlotte?

224
00:26:09.458 --> 00:26:10.666
Trespassing!

225
00:26:12.833 --> 00:26:16.416
Just making sure her majesty
is tucked in and ready for bed.

226
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:20.958
Her majesty is.

227
00:26:21.833 --> 00:26:24.125
I really wish her majesty
wouldn't do that.

228
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:27.041
because her majesty might
break the bed again.

229
00:26:28.458 --> 00:26:31.166
Her majesty notes your concern
with indifference.

230
00:26:33.416 --> 00:26:35.833
You know those new sketches
of yours are really good.

231
00:26:36.458 --> 00:26:39.541
The posing. the cross-hatching.
it's great work.

232
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.125
Thanks.

233
00:26:42.041 --> 00:26:44.625
Do you think I could. ah...

234
00:26:44.625 --> 00:26:47.291
Do you think I could steal
the giant spider idea?

235
00:26:47.291 --> 00:26:48.958
For the book?

236
00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:51.208
Okay.

237
00:26:53.166 --> 00:26:54.833
But you owe me chocolate.

238
00:26:54.833 --> 00:26:56.333
Deal.

239
00:26:56.666 --> 00:26:58.500
And 90 percent of the profit.

240
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.375
No deal.

241
00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:06.416
You know.
I'm really proud of you.

242
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.416
I probably don't say
that to you enough.

243
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:14.875
I love you.

244
00:27:16.125 --> 00:27:17.375
I really do.

245
00:27:17.375 --> 00:27:18.916
Have you been drinking?

246
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:22.541
Just enough to keep me honest.

247
00:27:24.458 --> 00:27:28.083
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure. anything.

248
00:27:30.458 --> 00:27:32.250
Did you erase those
pencil changes

249
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.750
I made to the Professor's
glasses today?

250
00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:36.791
I did. I'm sorry.

251
00:27:36.791 --> 00:27:40.625
I just thought that it looked
cooler the way it was.

252
00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:43.291
It's okay. I don't mind that
you changed them.

253
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.125
Just don't pretend like you
like my ideas if you don't.

254
00:27:52.333 --> 00:27:54.291
Night. Ethan.

255
00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:07.125
Goodnight. Charlotte.

256
00:28:08.333 --> 00:28:10.666
Sleep tight.

257
00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:25.166
Did you hear
that spiders can fly?

258
00:29:25.583 --> 00:29:27.708
Cloth please. Ethan.

259
00:29:27.708 --> 00:29:29.916
They use wind systems to travel
hundreds of miles apparently.

260
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:31.583
- Here.
- Thanks. honey.

261
00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:32.833
I've got a call
in 30 minutes.

262
00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:34.125
and now I have to
change my shirt.

263
00:29:34.125 --> 00:29:35.708
- Are you still okay to take him?
- This morning?

264
00:29:35.708 --> 00:29:37.041
And they have
blue blood!

265
00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:38.000
Yeah. I have client
calls all morning.

266
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.041
Isn't that crazy?

267
00:29:39.041 --> 00:29:40.416
Deadline
this afternoon.

268
00:29:40.416 --> 00:29:42.500
- It's totally blue!
- Yep. yep. copy that.

269
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.291
I know you have your
deadline as well. but...

270
00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:46.125
Last week
he ate paint!

271
00:29:46.125 --> 00:29:47.250
We can't trust him
not to try and kill himself.

272
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.750
Is anyone even listening to me?

273
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.666
Yes. I am. I am.
Blue blood. blue blood.

274
00:29:50.666 --> 00:29:52.916
Ah. forget it!

275
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.416
Don't forget to wear Grandma's
new sweater today.

276
00:29:56.416 --> 00:29:59.125
No way. that's going
to give me cancer.

277
00:29:59.125 --> 00:30:01.958
Mothballs! She thinks
they're carcinogenic.

278
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:03.416
What's with the attitude?

279
00:30:03.416 --> 00:30:05.958
I think she's still pissed
about Professor's glasses.

280
00:30:06.291 --> 00:30:07.416
Oh. she got over that.

281
00:30:07.416 --> 00:30:10.333
I'm not so sure.
I think I really messed up.

282
00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:12.500
And now it'’s all because of
a drawing of a perfect dad.

283
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.833
He left us and he hardly
even talks to her.

284
00:30:13.833 --> 00:30:15.250
How is he perfect?

285
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.000
Every time I try and connect
she takes two steps back.

286
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.958
Think about it. there's a new
baby in the house.

287
00:30:19.958 --> 00:30:21.208
You're stressed and distant.

288
00:30:21.208 --> 00:30:22.625
she probably just thinks
you're going to bail.

289
00:30:22.625 --> 00:30:23.875
Oh. come on--

290
00:30:23.875 --> 00:30:25.500
Do you have any idea
how much you mean to her?

291
00:30:25.916 --> 00:30:27.208
She talks like you.
she dresses like you.

292
00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:28.791
she reads the same
books as you.

293
00:30:28.791 --> 00:30:30.625
She didn't even start drawing
until you came into her life.

294
00:30:30.625 --> 00:30:32.583
and now it is like all she does.

295
00:30:32.916 --> 00:30:34.500
You're her biggest hero. alright?

296
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.958
What do you need.
a roadmap?

297
00:30:35.958 --> 00:30:37.375
Yeah.

298
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.791
- I don't know
- Alright...

299
00:30:42.625 --> 00:30:44.708
Speaking of the Professor.
when are we going to tell her?

300
00:30:44.708 --> 00:30:45.875
We can't keep pretending.

301
00:30:45.875 --> 00:30:47.625
I mean the guy's been back
how long now?

302
00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:49.583
Yeah! Yeah. I know. alright?

303
00:30:49.583 --> 00:30:51.541
Can I just deal with
that on my own time?

304
00:30:52.041 --> 00:30:54.333
Right now I have to
get ready for a meeting. ah...

305
00:30:55.125 --> 00:30:57.458
- Can you take over here?
- A-ha.

306
00:30:59.208 --> 00:31:00.333
Hey. little buddy.

307
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.500
Okay. Fuck!

308
00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:12.291
Yeah. I think if we work
with the back section

309
00:31:12.291 --> 00:31:14.583
to keep the facade. we can
still satisfy. you know.

310
00:31:14.583 --> 00:31:16.291
all the conservation requirements.

311
00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:18.500
Yeah. totally.

312
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.375
Alright...

313
00:31:20.375 --> 00:31:23.791
Sandy yes. yes. I know
I'm a few pages behind.

314
00:31:23.791 --> 00:31:25.750
but you'll have more
by the end of the day.

315
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.208
I am literally drawing
as we speak.

316
00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:33.083
Okay. chat later.

317
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.125
No! Ahh! Ahh!

318
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.041
Sweet Jesus! What the
hell happened to him?

319
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:51.708
Rats.

320
00:31:52.208 --> 00:31:53.250
Rats?

321
00:31:54.208 --> 00:31:56.875
I don't think a rat's
going to do that.

322
00:31:58.708 --> 00:32:02.416
- You call Frank.
- Who?

323
00:32:02.416 --> 00:32:04.541
The exterminator.

324
00:32:06.875 --> 00:32:08.166
Yeah. hello?

325
00:32:08.166 --> 00:32:11.750
Yo. you the one that called me
about a dead parrot?

326
00:32:12.875 --> 00:32:15.916
That's one seriously
fucked up bird.

327
00:32:18.791 --> 00:32:21.583
Looks like it tried to have
sex with a blender.

328
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.291
Hmm. whatever
did this was small.

329
00:32:29.083 --> 00:32:30.750
Attacked from the inside.

330
00:32:31.333 --> 00:32:34.208
and this poor motherfucker tried
to squeeze through the bars.

331
00:32:34.458 --> 00:32:35.833
Could it be rats?

332
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:37.291
No.

333
00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:38.958
Hell. no!

334
00:32:39.333 --> 00:32:41.833
Rats don't melt their food
before they eat it.

335
00:32:50.875 --> 00:32:52.125
What's with the nail gun?

336
00:32:52.416 --> 00:32:54.083
Protection.

337
00:32:55.916 --> 00:32:57.375
From what?

338
00:32:58.625 --> 00:33:00.916
It's New York. man.
Take your pick.

339
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.875
You think it came
out of the air duct?

340
00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:13.875
Yeah. man.

341
00:33:19.166 --> 00:33:22.250
I'm going to have to smoke
this whole damn building.

342
00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:31.333
Hey. Grandma?

343
00:33:31.333 --> 00:33:34.041
I'm going to find out whatever
killed your little feather baby

344
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:37.833
and when I do. I'm going
to exterminate its ass!

345
00:33:40.958 --> 00:33:42.500
Who's he?

346
00:34:15.208 --> 00:34:17.125
You're a mimic.

347
00:34:42.416 --> 00:34:43.791
Ew!

348
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:46.000
Mothball.

349
00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:13.333
Wow! You're a lot bigger.

350
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.958
Awesome!

351
00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:20.791
It will then form
a digestive fluid

352
00:35:20.791 --> 00:35:23.708
directly into the body
of the captured creature.

353
00:35:23.708 --> 00:35:27.666
in order to liquify its meat
before it starts to feed.

354
00:35:27.666 --> 00:35:30.750
The spider bite will paralyse
its prey temporarily.

355
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.291
because it likes to feed
on living flesh.

356
00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:36.750
So when it eats you.
you are alive.

357
00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:49.208
Hey!

358
00:35:49.416 --> 00:35:51.041
Hey?

359
00:35:51.041 --> 00:35:52.416
Hey. why your fish all scared?

360
00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:54.000
Please don't do that.

361
00:35:54.416 --> 00:35:56.500
Even the slightest change in
their chemical makeup

362
00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.791
could interfere with my work.

363
00:35:58.958 --> 00:36:00.500
Uh-huh.

364
00:36:01.083 --> 00:36:02.583
What kind of work would that be?

365
00:36:02.583 --> 00:36:06.750
I am studying their ability to
regrow pancreatic beta cells.

366
00:36:07.541 --> 00:36:09.000
Oh!

367
00:36:09.291 --> 00:36:11.125
You can do
that in your kitchen?

368
00:36:12.708 --> 00:36:17.166
You can laugh. but this work
that I do could save many lives.

369
00:36:17.833 --> 00:36:19.125
Yeah.

370
00:36:19.541 --> 00:36:21.625
Bad luck for the fish though.

371
00:36:27.416 --> 00:36:29.416
How long will this take?

372
00:36:30.291 --> 00:36:32.000
I think I finished.

373
00:36:32.291 --> 00:36:33.666
Yeah. if you could just send
me through the plan.

374
00:36:33.666 --> 00:36:35.791
that'll be easy. no. I can get
it back to you tomorrow.

375
00:36:37.833 --> 00:36:40.500
Which plug-in do you have?
The newest one?

376
00:36:40.916 --> 00:36:43.125
I think that Robert's
a much stronger choice.

377
00:36:43.125 --> 00:36:45.250
It's just the renderings
are way better in 2D.

378
00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:46.875
There's more information.

379
00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:50.458
Well that's great.

380
00:36:50.458 --> 00:36:52.666
then we can just send it
right out to the engineers...

381
00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:14.666
Hmm.

382
00:37:24.583 --> 00:37:26.125
Don't spray
in my room.

383
00:37:27.875 --> 00:37:29.125
Hey.

384
00:37:30.083 --> 00:37:31.291
This your room?

385
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:32.875
I don't need
a spray in here.

386
00:37:33.791 --> 00:37:35.291
Sting won't like it.

387
00:37:35.291 --> 00:37:38.875
Sting!? Who's that? Your little
pet kitty cat or something?

388
00:37:40.666 --> 00:37:42.208
No.

389
00:37:42.375 --> 00:37:43.541
Pet spider.

390
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:45.333
Spider?

391
00:37:45.333 --> 00:37:47.375
Hmm. I don't know about that.

392
00:37:47.375 --> 00:37:49.250
I don't think spiders
make good pets.

393
00:37:49.666 --> 00:37:51.083
Why not?

394
00:37:51.375 --> 00:37:53.875
You know. spiders don't
have the capacity to love.

395
00:37:53.875 --> 00:37:58.958
Not like a dog. Dogs. they'll
love ya and cats half-love ya.

396
00:37:59.416 --> 00:38:00.666
I always say
never make friends

397
00:38:00.666 --> 00:38:02.791
with anything with
more than four legs.

398
00:38:02.791 --> 00:38:05.583
But a spider only
knows two things.

399
00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:08.083
and that's eat and kill.

400
00:38:08.916 --> 00:38:10.708
I disagree.

401
00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:13.041
Okay.

402
00:38:13.833 --> 00:38:15.000
May I see?

403
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.250
Okay.

404
00:38:27.458 --> 00:38:28.708
See what we got here.

405
00:38:32.625 --> 00:38:34.500
What the?

406
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.500
She doesn't like you.

407
00:38:45.875 --> 00:38:49.708
No! No. no. no. no.
That price is too much.

408
00:38:49.708 --> 00:38:51.791
Ma'am. the price is the price.

409
00:38:51.791 --> 00:38:53.458
Your father never
charged this much.

410
00:38:53.458 --> 00:38:55.250
Do I look like my father?

411
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:58.166
Listen! My prices are fair.

412
00:38:58.166 --> 00:39:00.083
I pay half.

413
00:39:00.083 --> 00:39:03.666
You lack character. You're
cheap. You're mean and cheap.

414
00:39:03.666 --> 00:39:05.875
You! You should be doing this.

415
00:39:06.333 --> 00:39:09.333
Goddamn that scary
looking motherfucker.

416
00:39:09.333 --> 00:39:11.666
I'm really sorry about that.

417
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.375
I sprayed this whole
damn building.

418
00:39:16.375 --> 00:39:18.250
and all you want to pay is half.

419
00:39:20.125 --> 00:39:22.375
You're right to send
the invoice. yeah?

420
00:39:23.625 --> 00:39:25.208
Yeah.

421
00:40:01.916 --> 00:40:04.875
It's okay. I know you're hungry.

422
00:40:17.791 --> 00:40:19.666
Want some more?

423
00:44:22.583 --> 00:44:23.875
Erik's a scientist. right?

424
00:44:23.875 --> 00:44:27.458
Erik from upstairs? God no.
did he tell you that?

425
00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:29.500
He's not a scientist.
he's a biology student.

426
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.208
His mum buys
everything for him.

427
00:44:31.208 --> 00:44:32.958
He's up there trying
to cure diabetes

428
00:44:32.958 --> 00:44:34.750
with fishguts or something.

429
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:37.083
He's a weird guy. you should
stay away from him.

430
00:44:40.375 --> 00:44:41.750
Hi. Erik.

431
00:44:43.083 --> 00:44:45.291
Charlotte. can I help you?

432
00:44:45.291 --> 00:44:47.375
I want to buy one
of your fish tanks.

433
00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:52.250
I have 63 dollars and 85 cents.
Is that enough?

434
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:54.458
I didn't know you had fish.

435
00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:56.750
I don't. I have a spider.

436
00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.916
What kind of spider is it?

437
00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:06.833
I don't know.
I can't find a match on Google.

438
00:45:07.916 --> 00:45:10.375
How fast do spiders
usually grow?

439
00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:13.666
Well. that depends. some reach
maturity in a few weeks.

440
00:45:13.666 --> 00:45:15.625
Some take years.

441
00:45:15.625 --> 00:45:18.833
Could a spider grow twice
as big in a couple of hours?

442
00:45:18.833 --> 00:45:22.000
No. that is
a physiological impossibility.

443
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.750
Not for this one.

444
00:45:25.916 --> 00:45:27.500
Want to see her feed?

445
00:45:28.208 --> 00:45:30.833
Charlotte. do your parents
know that you're here?

446
00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:38.083
She likes the dark.

447
00:45:39.875 --> 00:45:41.541
Watch this.

448
00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:53.916
That's her feeding call.

449
00:45:53.916 --> 00:45:56.041
That means she's hungry.

450
00:45:56.041 --> 00:45:58.500
Charlotte. spiders
don't have vocal chords.

451
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.500
This is not a spider.

452
00:46:00.875 --> 00:46:04.125
I told you.
this one's different.

453
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:05.875
Wait!

454
00:46:07.875 --> 00:46:11.416
If this thing is venomous
that is not a good idea.

455
00:46:11.916 --> 00:46:13.958
Don't worry. I do
this all the time.

456
00:46:19.083 --> 00:46:21.208
Cool. right?

457
00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:23.875
You want to see
what she looks like?

458
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.750
Hmm.

459
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:36.541
Charlotte. I will lend you one
of my tanks. no charge.

460
00:46:36.541 --> 00:46:37.958
But I need to make sure

461
00:46:37.958 --> 00:46:40.208
that it is the exact right
enclosure for this species

462
00:46:40.208 --> 00:46:42.333
or it could be harmful.
Do you understand?

463
00:46:43.041 --> 00:46:45.625
If you just leave this with me
for a short while.

464
00:46:45.625 --> 00:46:47.458
I'll transfer it to
the correct case

465
00:46:47.458 --> 00:46:49.166
and bring it
straight down to you.

466
00:46:49.166 --> 00:46:51.125
- Can I watch?
- No!

467
00:46:51.125 --> 00:46:54.875
I need to do this alone. It is
an extremely delicate process.

468
00:46:54.875 --> 00:46:57.583
This really is all that I ask.

469
00:46:57.583 --> 00:47:00.125
Okay. but when you
bring her back

470
00:47:00.125 --> 00:47:02.291
make sure Ethan doesn't see.

471
00:47:04.583 --> 00:47:06.166
When you said

472
00:47:06.166 --> 00:47:07.375
that you were going to
be honest about this?

473
00:47:07.375 --> 00:47:08.833
- Did you mean it?
- Of course I meant it.

474
00:47:08.833 --> 00:47:10.833
But if I take this job we can
finally move out of here.

475
00:47:10.833 --> 00:47:12.041
We can even get
Charlotte's teeth fixed.

476
00:47:12.041 --> 00:47:13.583
Come on. Charlotte's
teeth are fine.

477
00:47:13.583 --> 00:47:15.583
If it were Liam's teeth. you'd
get them fixed in a second.

478
00:47:15.958 --> 00:47:17.625
Wow!

479
00:47:35.416 --> 00:47:37.125
Hey. be careful.

480
00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:25.166
Maria! It's Ethan.

481
00:48:26.083 --> 00:48:27.833
I've got your dog.

482
00:48:32.375 --> 00:48:35.541
Okay. I'm just going to open the
door and let Bonnie in. okay?

483
00:49:38.541 --> 00:49:40.833
Had she been acting
strangely recently?

484
00:49:41.208 --> 00:49:42.875
Moody. depressed?

485
00:49:43.958 --> 00:49:49.833
Um. depressed. ah.
she's a big drinker. so...

486
00:49:49.833 --> 00:49:51.875
What were you doing
in her apartment?

487
00:49:52.083 --> 00:49:53.750
Just bringing her dog back.

488
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.833
And when there was no answer I
I have a skeleton key. so...

489
00:49:58.833 --> 00:50:00.458
Why do you have a skeleton key?

490
00:50:01.708 --> 00:50:03.416
I'm the building supervisor.

491
00:50:03.416 --> 00:50:06.666
- Ah. is that right?
- Yep.

492
00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:11.583
Go ahead.

493
00:50:14.875 --> 00:50:16.250
Yeah.

494
00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:18.291
This is Erik John Kwong here.
I'm calling in regards...

495
00:50:18.291 --> 00:50:19.750
Who is this?

496
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:21.166
This is Erik John Kwong here.
I'm calling in regards...

497
00:50:21.166 --> 00:50:22.416
Who?

498
00:50:22.416 --> 00:50:24.125
I'm calling about
your daughter. Charlotte.

499
00:50:24.125 --> 00:50:25.916
What about her?

500
00:50:26.833 --> 00:50:29.166
The main issue is that
part of my dissertation

501
00:50:29.166 --> 00:50:30.750
involves arachnology.

502
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:33.375
so I have a fair bit of
knowledge in these areas.

503
00:50:33.375 --> 00:50:36.416
and I have no idea what
kind of spider this is.

504
00:50:37.875 --> 00:50:39.708
That is worrying.

505
00:50:39.875 --> 00:50:42.166
You should not be keeping
this in your apartment.

506
00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:46.000
That's all very
interesting. Erik.

507
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.791
but I assure you Charlotte's
not keeping a spider

508
00:50:47.791 --> 00:50:49.416
in the apartment.

509
00:50:49.416 --> 00:50:52.458
I suspect this a
highly venomous arachnid.

510
00:50:52.458 --> 00:50:54.708
It could be a killer.

511
00:50:55.666 --> 00:50:57.333
I honestly think this
is an issue for

512
00:50:57.333 --> 00:50:58.708
the Department of
Health and Safety.

513
00:50:58.708 --> 00:51:00.833
Wait. wait a minute.
wait a minute. A killer?

514
00:51:00.833 --> 00:51:02.416
Health and Safety!

515
00:51:02.416 --> 00:51:04.666
What kind of spider are
we talking about here?

516
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.208
A big one!

517
00:51:16.625 --> 00:51:19.125
Fucking. fuck!

518
00:51:28.125 --> 00:51:29.541
Don't get mad.
I said that Bonnie can stay

519
00:51:29.541 --> 00:51:31.500
for just a couple
of days until we...

520
00:51:33.125 --> 00:51:34.500
Charlotte!

521
00:51:35.666 --> 00:51:36.833
When were you going to tell us

522
00:51:36.833 --> 00:51:38.750
you had a giant venomous
spider in this house?

523
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.208
A what?

524
00:51:40.208 --> 00:51:41.875
I've just came back from Erik's
apartment and there is--

525
00:51:41.875 --> 00:51:43.375
What have you done with Sting?

526
00:51:43.375 --> 00:51:45.750
Erik's taking that thing down to
the Department of Health.

527
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:48.583
We are not having a venomous
arachnid in this home near Liam.

528
00:51:51.083 --> 00:51:53.500
Erik?

529
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.125
Erik! Erik. open up!

530
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:59.791
Erik!

531
00:52:03.375 --> 00:52:05.458
You had no right to do that.

532
00:52:05.458 --> 00:52:07.875
Listen. Char...

533
00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:10.125
You didn't even
talk to me about it.

534
00:52:10.125 --> 00:52:12.666
You just took her away from me.

535
00:52:15.583 --> 00:52:16.583
I understand.

536
00:52:16.583 --> 00:52:18.666
I read your 'Fang Grrl'
comic book.

537
00:52:18.666 --> 00:52:20.166
and it sucks!

538
00:52:22.416 --> 00:52:24.000
You've taken out
everything that's cool.

539
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.416
and you've killed the Professor!

540
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.875
He's one of the most important
characters of the whole thing.

541
00:52:28.875 --> 00:52:30.125
Why would you do that?

542
00:52:30.125 --> 00:52:31.458
I don't know why--

543
00:52:31.458 --> 00:52:33.083
Bullshit!

544
00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:36.000
You just don't like him because
he's based on my dad.

545
00:52:38.625 --> 00:52:40.833
And my dad is awesome.

546
00:52:41.333 --> 00:52:43.000
Is that why he never visits?

547
00:52:43.583 --> 00:52:44.541
Ethan!

548
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.625
He lives in Thailand. you idiot.
He can't visit.

549
00:52:48.875 --> 00:52:51.458
He lives across the Bridge.
it's a 25 minute drive.

550
00:52:51.458 --> 00:52:53.916
Oh. how dare you.

551
00:52:59.166 --> 00:53:00.916
Mum?

552
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.916
Char!

553
00:53:11.166 --> 00:53:12.791
Hey...

554
00:53:13.416 --> 00:53:15.416
Get away from me!

555
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:20.833
Thanks a lot. Ethan.

556
00:53:21.166 --> 00:53:22.875
That's going to be a real boost
for her self-confidence.

557
00:53:22.875 --> 00:53:24.458
- Nice work.
- Well. I'm sorry.

558
00:53:24.458 --> 00:53:25.875
Alright. well someone had to
tell her. You weren't going to.

559
00:53:25.875 --> 00:53:28.000
He's been back for six months.
she should know that.

560
00:53:28.625 --> 00:53:30.208
That is not your job to decide.

561
00:53:30.208 --> 00:53:32.291
It's not my decision!
I'm her dad!

562
00:53:32.708 --> 00:53:33.750
Am I?

563
00:53:34.375 --> 00:53:36.083
Am I her dad?

564
00:53:37.375 --> 00:53:39.375
Because he left. I'm here!

565
00:53:40.041 --> 00:53:43.708
This! This here had
nothing to do with her.

566
00:53:43.708 --> 00:53:45.041
This was about you.

567
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.458
Charlotte!

568
00:53:48.708 --> 00:53:51.541
Charlotte. sweetheart.
I'm sorry.

569
00:54:02.083 --> 00:54:05.875
Yes! Eat!

570
00:54:06.208 --> 00:54:07.916
Grow as big as you can.

571
00:54:16.125 --> 00:54:18.375
Who's next?

572
00:54:54.416 --> 00:54:56.250
Thanks a lot. Ethan.

573
00:56:28.708 --> 00:56:30.625
You should meet my daughter.

574
00:56:32.791 --> 00:56:34.791
I am
your daughter. Mum.

575
00:56:35.333 --> 00:56:38.083
I don't know
why we bother.

576
00:56:39.125 --> 00:56:42.333
She doesn't even know
where she is half the time.

577
00:56:42.666 --> 00:56:45.916
Gunter. isn't there a broomstick
out there somewhere

578
00:56:45.916 --> 00:56:47.916
that needs riding?

579
00:57:16.791 --> 00:57:19.541
Hi Ethan.
this is Sandy here.

580
00:57:19.541 --> 00:57:22.916
Listen. we've had to go with
Alan for the rest of the book.

581
00:57:22.916 --> 00:57:25.666
I'm really sorry.
but these pages.

582
00:57:25.666 --> 00:57:27.083
they're just not coming
fast enough

583
00:57:27.083 --> 00:57:29.750
and we're really in too deep
now to cancel the run.

584
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:32.583
Obviously this is not ideal but
we're still very much hoping

585
00:57:32.583 --> 00:57:35.333
that you can jump back
on board for some of them.

586
00:57:38.541 --> 00:57:40.541
Hey! Hey! Hey!

587
00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:42.458
Hey. what you doing?

588
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:47.083
I'm fixing the heater.

589
00:57:47.083 --> 00:57:48.791
Like that.
you're fixing the heater?

590
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:52.458
Yeah it's a...
a legitimate technique.

591
00:57:52.458 --> 00:57:54.375
This isn't working out.

592
00:57:54.375 --> 00:57:56.416
We'll see out the month
but after that.

593
00:57:56.416 --> 00:57:58.666
there's no more work here.

594
00:57:59.333 --> 00:58:02.333
You take a paycheck away
from your own family?

595
00:58:08.625 --> 00:58:10.541
You're not family.

596
00:58:12.041 --> 00:58:13.708
Why do you hate me?

597
00:58:14.208 --> 00:58:16.541
I don't hate you. Ethan.

598
00:58:17.208 --> 00:58:20.333
I think you're a nice guy.
but you're weak.

599
00:58:20.333 --> 00:58:24.583
and like all weak men.
when the going gets hard.

600
00:58:24.583 --> 00:58:26.958
you leave!

601
00:58:27.208 --> 00:58:30.166
I'm just going to do
everyone a big favour.

602
00:58:30.166 --> 00:58:32.791
and help ya out the door.

603
00:58:59.416 --> 00:59:01.583
Hey kitty. kitty. kitty.

604
00:59:02.583 --> 00:59:04.750
Kitty. kitty. kitty!

605
00:59:06.166 --> 00:59:08.125
Stupid cat!

606
00:59:27.083 --> 00:59:28.583
Kitty?

607
00:59:28.708 --> 00:59:30.208
Kitty!

608
00:59:30.208 --> 00:59:31.583
Who you talking to?

609
00:59:31.583 --> 00:59:33.208
It's the cat.

610
00:59:33.208 --> 00:59:34.583
We have a cat?

611
00:59:36.125 --> 00:59:38.500
Oh. shut up. Helga.

612
00:59:48.875 --> 00:59:51.541
Kitty. kitty!

613
00:59:53.333 --> 00:59:55.000
Kitty?

614
00:59:57.541 --> 00:59:59.916
What! What's that?

615
01:00:06.083 --> 01:00:07.708
What you doing in there?

616
01:00:07.708 --> 01:00:10.500
Come on out. you stupid animal.

617
01:00:17.958 --> 01:00:20.250
I'm much too drunk for this.

618
01:00:40.291 --> 01:00:42.041
Kitty?

619
01:00:43.375 --> 01:00:45.708
Oh!

620
01:00:48.916 --> 01:00:50.583
Stupid flashlight.

621
01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:01.208
Kitty?

622
01:01:43.916 --> 01:01:45.083
The National Weather Service
is now calling this

623
01:01:45.083 --> 01:01:47.625
the worst ice storm
in the State's history.

624
01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:50.083
With sustained wind speeds
of up to 45 miles per hour...

625
01:02:18.666 --> 01:02:20.166
I'm so sorry. Todd.

626
01:02:20.166 --> 01:02:22.166
I'm going to have to
call you right back.

627
01:02:27.041 --> 01:02:28.625
Charlotte.

628
01:02:30.083 --> 01:02:31.458
Can you take Bonnie
and your brother

629
01:02:31.458 --> 01:02:33.333
into the other room
for a minute. please?

630
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:42.458
Come on. Liam.

631
01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:52.791
You want to tell me what
just happened here?

632
01:02:54.916 --> 01:02:57.333
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have done that.

633
01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:01.166
Ethan. I think you
need to get some help.

634
01:03:01.166 --> 01:03:02.458
Just there's a lot
going on at the moment.

635
01:03:02.458 --> 01:03:05.791
and I just. ah...

636
01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:13.000
Whatever's going on with you...

637
01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:16.291
it can't be happening
in front of the kids.

638
01:03:17.333 --> 01:03:19.791
I'm losing it. ah...

639
01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:23.041
You're not losing it. Ethan.
You're losing us.

640
01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:24.416
Do you understand?

641
01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:36.125
I love you.

642
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:38.958
I really do.

643
01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:41.750
But I can't do this again.

644
01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:30.958
Mum?

645
01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:59.708
What the hell is going on?

646
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.666
Oh shit!

647
01:06:53.416 --> 01:06:55.166
Bonnie?

648
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:58.291
Bonnie!

649
01:07:05.125 --> 01:07:07.041
Sting?

650
01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:49.958
Sting!

651
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.916
Bring him back!

652
01:10:03.625 --> 01:10:05.083
Erik?

653
01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.041
Erik?

654
01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:09.791
Erik!

655
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:30.541
You got a problem with doors?

656
01:10:37.916 --> 01:10:40.041
Grandma. look at me.

657
01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:43.333
Have you seen anything freaky
or scary recently?

658
01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.875
Oh!

659
01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:49.958
There was a dog. a black dog.
a strange animal.

660
01:10:49.958 --> 01:10:52.375
When I try to pet it
she runs from me.

661
01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.416
- It ran from you?
- Ja.

662
01:10:58.375 --> 01:10:59.958
Don't take this off. Grandma.

663
01:11:00.375 --> 01:11:02.125
Okay.

664
01:11:21.916 --> 01:11:24.041
I'm going to go get some help. okay?

665
01:11:24.208 --> 01:11:25.375
- Ja?
- Ja.

666
01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:27.750
But if the phone line
comes back on.

667
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.250
you have to call the police.

668
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:31.875
The police? Ja.

669
01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:36.041
Do you know the number?

670
01:11:37.791 --> 01:11:39.458
What number?

671
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.583
Take care. Grandma.

672
01:11:55.875 --> 01:11:57.750
You take care.

673
01:12:20.708 --> 01:12:23.083
What a strange girl.

674
01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:39.458
Ethan?

675
01:12:39.666 --> 01:12:41.416
Ethan!

676
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:46.041
Ethan?

677
01:12:46.041 --> 01:12:48.125
Help me... Please!

678
01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:56.291
Be careful. Be careful!

679
01:12:56.291 --> 01:12:58.291
Careful!

680
01:13:01.166 --> 01:13:04.416
Don't touch the web.

681
01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:10.291
Are you okay?

682
01:13:10.833 --> 01:13:12.083
Not really.

683
01:13:13.291 --> 01:13:15.458
Where's Mum? Where's Liam?

684
01:13:16.708 --> 01:13:18.250
I don't know.

685
01:13:18.916 --> 01:13:20.875
I can get these webs off. okay?

686
01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:22.958
But then you'll drop.

687
01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.625
You have to hang on
to these grooves.

688
01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:28.083
- Do you think you can do that?
- Okay.

689
01:13:28.083 --> 01:13:29.166
Okay!

690
01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:39.791
Who is it?

691
01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:42.750
It's Frank! The exterminator.

692
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:44.250
Buzz me up. damn it!

693
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.916
Ethan. do you think you
can make it to the trapdoor?

694
01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:20.458
It's okay. I have mothball
water. It's like acid to her.

695
01:14:20.458 --> 01:14:23.916
- It hurts her. Okay?
- Okay.

696
01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:31.166
You called the Bugbrothers
out to re-do my job?

697
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.541
Okay.

698
01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:45.958
Liam?

699
01:14:45.958 --> 01:14:48.666
Liam! Liam!

700
01:14:48.666 --> 01:14:49.875
I'm coming!

701
01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:52.166
Ethan. Ethan. stop!
Shh. shh. shh!

702
01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:22.625
Don't move.

703
01:15:37.916 --> 01:15:39.166
Ethan!

704
01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:48.541
Don't you fucking touch her!

705
01:15:52.541 --> 01:15:57.208
Come down here again.
I'll fucking kill you!

706
01:16:04.458 --> 01:16:06.750
You scared her away.

707
01:16:10.875 --> 01:16:13.916
Are you okay? Hey. Charlotte!

708
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.833
I'm okay.

709
01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.000
It's all my fault.

710
01:16:24.083 --> 01:16:26.583
This is not your fault.
Listen to me. Look at me.

711
01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:28.041
Look at me!

712
01:16:28.791 --> 01:16:31.541
This is not your fault. okay?

713
01:16:31.541 --> 01:16:33.375
Now we have to deal
with this together.

714
01:16:34.458 --> 01:16:35.833

01:16:39.333 --> 01:16:40.833
Let's go!

717
01:16:41.208 --> 01:16:43.833
No! No. don't leave me here.

718
01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:45.000

722
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.833
What the fuck was that?

723
01:16:59.166 --> 01:17:00.250
It's Sting.

724
01:17:02.375 --> 01:17:03.750
Sting!

725
01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:04.791
Sting!

726
01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:06.958
That's your spider?

727
01:17:07.833 --> 01:17:10.208
Why didn't you
get a fucking dog!?

728
01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:13.291
Ah. I'm getting

You need to neuter
that motherfucker. man!

732
01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:23.625
I'm getting the fuck
out of this place.

733
01:17:23.625 --> 01:17:25.375
That's the last one.

734
01:17:26.416 --> 01:17:27.416
Fuck! It's locked.

735
01:17:27.416 --> 01:17:30.083
Fuck! It's locked!

736
01:17:30.583 --> 01:17:32.375
- Fuck!
- We're trapped.

737
01:17:32.375 --> 01:17:35.291
This fucking
door won't open!

738
01:17:35.291 --> 01:17:37.875
Hey! Where's the key?

739
01:17:38.333 --> 01:17:40.291
Yo. you got a key? I'm talking!
Do you have a fucking key?

740
01:17:40.291 --> 01:17:41.458
Hey. hey. calm down.

741
01:17:41.458 --> 01:17:43.000
Where's the key?

742
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.666
Frank! Get the hell off of me.
If this spills. we're dead!

743
01:17:48.333 --> 01:17:49.458
What is it?

744
01:17:49.458 --> 01:17:51.166
It's mothball water!

745
01:17:54.083 --> 01:17:57.500
It's water.
with mothballs in it.

746
01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.708
It burns her webs. It hurts her.

747
01:18:03.833 --> 01:18:04.875
- Well. give me that shit.
- What the hell are you doing?

748
01:18:04.875 --> 01:18:06.166
- It's the last--
- Fuck off!

749
01:18:06.166 --> 01:18:07.750
Well. go make
some more mothball juice.

750
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:10.333
Frank. don't use it all! It's
the only weapon we have left.

751
01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:13.250
Fuck you! Fuck both of y'all!

752
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:17.333
Keep your little mothball juice.
I got the equaliser right here.

753
01:18:17.541 --> 01:18:18.875
Yeah!

754
01:18:19.833 --> 01:18:21.500

Let's go! Come out!

759
01:19:08.625 --> 01:19:10.833
It's bleeding!

760
01:19:11.166 --> 01:19:12.791
That means we can kill it!

761
01:19:17.625 --> 01:19:21.416
No! The water!
It's washing it off.

762
01:19:21.625 --> 01:19:23.541
We're not protected anymore.

763
01:19:29.208 --> 01:19:30.375
Let go!

764
01:19:43.833 --> 01:19:46.041
Get in the garbage compactor.

765
01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:50.625
Charlotte! Get in
the garbage compactor.

766
01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:52.291
Now! Come on.

767
01:20:08.666 --> 01:20:10.291
Mum!

768
01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:13.958

769
01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:15.083

Ethan!

778
01:23:17.541 --> 01:23:20.833
I close my eyes
and count to three.

779
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.666
