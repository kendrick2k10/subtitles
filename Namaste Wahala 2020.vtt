I'm just excited. that's all. I'm sure
your father can't wait to meet him.

342
00:23:09.541 --> 00:23:11.375
Where's he from?

343
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:18.416
Good evening. Auntie. I'm Raj.

344
00:23:23.541 --> 00:23:26.333
Good evening. Thank you.

345
00:23:27.708 --> 00:23:30.125
I'm sure Didi has told you all about me.

346
00:23:38.958 --> 00:23:40.458
Ernest!

347
00:23:42.041 --> 00:23:43.208
Good evening. Uncle.

348
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:45.500
I'm Raj.

349
00:23:50.333 --> 00:23:53.666
Chidinma. is this the best you can do?

350
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.291
-Ernest!
-He's a good man.

351
00:23:56.375 --> 00:24:00.083
There are many good men
that are Nigerians.

352
00:24:06.416 --> 00:24:09.541
-You bring me an Indian?
-Dad. please!

353
00:24:09.625 --> 00:24:12.083
OK. so why did you bring me an Indian?

354
00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:14.708
-Ernest.
-No. no. No. Shola. no.

355
00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:20.458
I've let you carry on with your
pro-bono thing for as long as you want.

356
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:26.666
but this. this right here…
marriage is serious business!

357
00:24:27.708 --> 00:24:31.125
He's the one I'm gonna hand my legacy
over to. for goodness' sake!

358
00:24:34.666 --> 00:24:37.500
[Igbo] I'm tired. I'm done!

359
00:24:51.791 --> 00:24:53.333
[Didi] I'm sorry.

360
00:24:58.208 --> 00:25:01.333
[Emma laughs]

361
00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:09.000
I don't know how you find this amusing.
I was mortified.

362
00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:14.416
They didn't even know I'm Indian.
Or I guess they didn't want to believe it.

363
00:25:16.583 --> 00:25:19.125
She should have at least prepped them
before I went there.

364
00:25:19.208 --> 00:25:21.750
Oh. she should have prepped them?
You didn't prep me.

365
00:25:21.833 --> 00:25:24.208
You didn't let me know
you were going there.

366
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:27.833
Ah! You should have told me. now.

367
00:25:27.916 --> 00:25:31.875
You should have told me you were
going there. I wold have prepped you.

368
00:25:31.958 --> 00:25:34.833
You can't just go to your in-laws' house
just like that.

369
00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:37.166
There are certain steps you have to take.

370
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.708
Like?

371
00:25:39.333 --> 00:25:42.291
I'm sure you went there dressed…
Western style.

372
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.833
-Yeah.
-See what I'm saying? No!

373
00:25:45.916 --> 00:25:49.458
You have paid penalty to throw in now.
You have to wear native attire.

374
00:25:49.541 --> 00:25:52.416
Let them know you are one of us. Blend in.

375
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.000
-And I'm sure you went there empty handed.
-No.

376
00:25:55.083 --> 00:25:57.583
I took a bottle of Italian vintage wine.

377
00:25:57.666 --> 00:25:59.416
Vintage wine!

378
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.875
You're a classy guy. Still wrong!

379
00:26:02.958 --> 00:26:08.083
Kola nuts. gin. palm wine. goat.

380
00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:10.500
-Goat?
-Goat!

381
00:26:11.583 --> 00:26:13.625
That's how we do things here.

382
00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:18.291
-Man. What am I gonna do now. Emma?
-You pray.

383
00:26:21.833 --> 00:26:23.291
[Didi] It was horrible.

384
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:26.125
It was so awkward.

385
00:26:29.458 --> 00:26:32.083
I don't want to relive
that experience again.

386
00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:36.458
[Angie] I'm so sorry. Dee. I… You know
I'd stay here with you all day if I could.

387
00:26:36.541 --> 00:26:39.416
It's just that my lunch break
is almost over. Are you OK?

388
00:26:40.333 --> 00:26:42.750
If you saw my dad's face…

389
00:26:42.833 --> 00:26:46.666
Didi. I've told you now.
forget about your dad.

390
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.208
You know he doesn't know
what the market is saying.

391
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:51.125
-What market?
-Just ignore--

392
00:26:51.208 --> 00:26:55.541
Don't ignore me. It's the dating market.
And I shop there every day.

393
00:26:55.625 --> 00:26:57.625
-And where are you doing the shopping?
-OK.

394
00:26:57.708 --> 00:27:02.083
So. there is social media.
there is dating sites.

395
00:27:02.166 --> 00:27:06.541
there's the supermarket. there's church…
funerals.

396
00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:08.500
-Angie!
-What is it now?

397
00:27:08.583 --> 00:27:09.958
Alone is lonely. you know.

398
00:27:10.041 --> 00:27:12.250
You better be careful.
it's a dangerous world out there.

399
00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:14.458
-Yes. tell her.
-I know. I know.

400
00:27:14.541 --> 00:27:16.000
-[knocking on door]
-I'll be fine.

401
00:27:16.083 --> 00:27:17.625
Come in!

402
00:27:18.916 --> 00:27:20.833
[Angie] Wow. look!

403
00:27:20.916 --> 00:27:23.500
-These just came in for you.
-Thank you.

404
00:27:25.916 --> 00:27:30.166
No wonder! Mm-mm. I can see why
the two of you are preaching at me.

405
00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.208
You… You have a man that is practically
begging to meet your parents.

406
00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:38.750
And you have a boyfriend that sends you
flowers and chocolates at work.

407
00:27:38.833 --> 00:27:41.333
-He's not my boyfriend.
-Oh! Then who is he?

408
00:27:41.416 --> 00:27:43.208
[coughs] Secret admirer.

409
00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:46.250
[shrieks] You have a secret admirer!

410
00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:49.916
Oh. that's so cool!
I didn't know they still existed.

411
00:27:51.083 --> 00:27:52.416
So romantic.

412
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.583
I don't understand the mystery. I don't
know why he just won't reveal himself.

413
00:27:55.666 --> 00:27:58.875
I'm sure he will. He's probably
just waiting for the right time.

414
00:27:58.958 --> 00:28:03.083
Alright. you guys. I have to go.
my lunch break is over.

415
00:28:03.166 --> 00:28:06.708
I'm just going to grab these.
These are looking…

416
00:28:06.791 --> 00:28:08.958
-Is it your own?
-You know I love love!

417
00:28:09.041 --> 00:28:10.583
-Leila!
-This is full of love.

418
00:28:10.666 --> 00:28:13.833
Are you feeling OK? Better?
Alright. I'll call you later.

419
00:28:13.916 --> 00:28:17.041
-Bye. guys!
-Bye.

420
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.625
So. are you gonna give him a call?
Have you spoken to him since you last met?

421
00:28:25.708 --> 00:28:26.750
Uh-uh.

422
00:28:26.833 --> 00:28:30.750
You know you can't leave it that way.
You're gonna have to eventually call him.

423
00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:34.458
[door opening]

424
00:28:41.375 --> 00:28:42.500
Hi.

425
00:28:43.083 --> 00:28:44.875
[sighs] Hi.

426
00:28:49.916 --> 00:28:51.375
Raj.

427
00:29:01.041 --> 00:29:02.916
About the other day.

428
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.875
I thought you told them.

429
00:29:07.958 --> 00:29:09.750
I tried.

430
00:29:13.083 --> 00:29:14.375
That wasn't fair. Didi.

431
00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:19.625
You let me walk right into the lions' den.
You should have at least prepped them.

432
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.541
It's not that easy.

433
00:29:23.958 --> 00:29:27.875
What part exactly? To tell them my name?
Or tell them where I'm from?

434
00:29:27.958 --> 00:29:29.625
[door opening]

435
00:29:30.791 --> 00:29:32.291
What do you want?

436
00:29:32.958 --> 00:29:36.000
I wanted to play my song.

437
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.750
But it can wait.

438
00:29:43.458 --> 00:29:46.083
-You're not being fair.
-What. and you are?

439
00:29:46.666 --> 00:29:48.541
Do you know how utterly embarrassed I was?

440
00:29:48.625 --> 00:29:51.625
And I said I was sorry.
What else do you want from me?

441
00:29:51.708 --> 00:29:53.125
-I want--
-[door opening]

442
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:54.708
[both] Get out!

443
00:29:56.375 --> 00:29:58.916
-Your father…
-[phone ringing]

444
00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:03.791
Ma. what is it?

445
00:30:06.125 --> 00:30:08.208
-What?
-Is everything OK?

446
00:30:14.666 --> 00:30:16.666
Yes. I'm in Nigeria. I've reached.

447
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.875
-Which one are we picking first?
-I said one minute.

448
00:30:18.958 --> 00:30:20.875
I was trying to get in touch with you.

449
00:30:20.958 --> 00:30:24.541
[Pidgin] Which one are we picking first?
They won't allow us to stay here.

450
00:30:24.625 --> 00:30:28.625
Put all three in the boot. And be careful
with that one. that's my wedding bag.

451
00:30:28.708 --> 00:30:30.666
-Your wedding bag?
-Be very careful.

452
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:34.208
-It would have been a wake keep bag.
-[Hindi] Why are they being so rude?

453
00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:38.458
Ma. you should have just sent me a text. I
would have picked you up from the airport.

454
00:30:38.541 --> 00:30:41.250
No. don't bother. I'm just coming.
I'm on my way.

455
00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:44.500
Is it a holiday you came for?
With all this luggage?

456
00:30:44.583 --> 00:30:47.291
How you going to pack it then?
Put one in front then.

457
00:30:47.375 --> 00:30:49.041
Waste of time.

458
00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:53.291
[Hindi] What is all this drama?

459
00:30:53.375 --> 00:30:54.583
-I'm finished.
-Now we go?

460
00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:57.125
-Where you go?
-We go to where I live.

461
00:30:57.208 --> 00:30:59.000
How do I know where you live?

462
00:30:59.083 --> 00:31:02.750
Do I look like your husband?
Or do I look your neighbor?

463
00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:05.500
We're going to Victoria Island. Can we go?

464
00:31:05.583 --> 00:31:08.750
Where in Victoria Island?
Victoria Island is divided into two.

465
00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:13.166
Is it at the axis of Ajah or Lekki?

466
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.333
I don't know. I'm going to my son's house.

467
00:31:15.416 --> 00:31:17.166
-Your son's house?
-In Victoria Island.

468
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.583
-Do I know your son?
-Follow the map.

469
00:31:18.666 --> 00:31:20.333
Doesn't it have an address?
What's this nonsense?

470
00:31:20.416 --> 00:31:23.666
God shouldn't let us meet bad clients.
Doesn't our destination have an address?

471
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.791
[Hindi] What is this?
Have you lost your mind?

472
00:31:25.875 --> 00:31:27.791
God won't spoil our work
cos I don't speak your language.

473
00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:30.083
-I will go inside.
-Come into the car.

474
00:31:30.166 --> 00:31:32.958
Let me be honest with you.
we will both get lost today.

475
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:35.208
We'll get lost.
at some point I'll drop you.

476
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:37.333
Hope you know they have banned
motorcycles?

477
00:31:37.416 --> 00:31:40.500
You'll get to your destination
with the help of a horse.

478
00:31:40.583 --> 00:31:42.333
Your fare is 3.500 naira.

479
00:31:42.416 --> 00:31:44.333
-Now you're talking about money?
-Yes.

480
00:31:44.416 --> 00:31:46.833
-I'll give you two five.
-You'll give me what?

481
00:31:46.916 --> 00:31:49.750
-Two what?
-Two five.

482
00:31:49.833 --> 00:31:51.458
Two five.

483
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.958
-Please come help unload her luggage.
-OK. OK. OK. I'll give you three.

484
00:31:57.041 --> 00:31:58.708
-Three five. last price.
-I'll give you three!

485
00:31:58.791 --> 00:32:01.125
-How can you give me 3.000?
-[Hindi] You're driving me mad!

486
00:32:01.208 --> 00:32:04.750
Did you buy the car for me? You would've
carried my car since you bought it for me.

487
00:32:04.833 --> 00:32:06.791
-I'll give you three.
-Three five.

488
00:32:06.875 --> 00:32:11.375
I'm taking it cos I want to pity you.
Because we would meet again.

489
00:32:11.458 --> 00:32:13.083
You're gonna pity me?

490
00:32:13.166 --> 00:32:15.875
[Hindi] If this was my country
I would have shown you sense.

491
00:32:15.958 --> 00:32:18.750
-Just get in. you don't have money.
-Attitude.

492
00:32:19.958 --> 00:32:21.875
Get in.

493
00:32:21.958 --> 00:32:25.875
[Hindi] Who knows where these cartoons
find me. Because of money. chu chu chu.

494
00:32:25.958 --> 00:32:28.291
Now you're sat behind
like you own the car.

495
00:32:28.375 --> 00:32:31.833
-Come on!
-You're in the owner's seat. get up front.

496
00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:34.583
-Why sit in front?
-There's no seatbelt in the back.

497
00:32:34.666 --> 00:32:37.083
Huh? Why do you want me to sit in front?

498
00:32:37.166 --> 00:32:38.291
It will shock you.

499
00:32:38.375 --> 00:32:40.500
[he mutters]

500
00:32:42.458 --> 00:32:44.208
You're such a pain.

501
00:32:44.291 --> 00:32:48.541
Now what? Now I'm sitting in front.
Now you take me to Victoria Island.

502
00:32:52.708 --> 00:32:56.041
Ahh! Where are you?

503
00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:00.708
That's a lie. Help me use the seatbelt
because LASTMA officials are approaching.

504
00:33:00.791 --> 00:33:05.208
It's not working. just hold it like this.

505
00:33:05.291 --> 00:33:08.375
Where are you? Eh?

506
00:33:09.458 --> 00:33:13.041
[they continue to argue]

507
00:33:13.125 --> 00:33:16.125
-Did you watch the Chelsea-Man U match?
-Get off the phone!

508
00:33:16.208 --> 00:33:19.250
I'll call you back.
I'm talking to my friend.

509
00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:21.291
We have to go home to Victoria Island.

510
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.458
-[Hindi] Come. Ma. Come. come.
-[Hindi] I'm so happy to see you.

511
00:33:28.541 --> 00:33:30.833
After how long am I seeing you? Tell me.

512
00:33:31.458 --> 00:33:34.375
You've become so thin.
You are not eating well. right?

513
00:33:34.458 --> 00:33:35.708
Ma. what have you brought?

514
00:33:35.791 --> 00:33:39.541
What have I brought? My stuff. what I
always bring. You know how I am!

515
00:33:40.125 --> 00:33:44.166
Huh? You have become so thin
your bones are sticking out.

516
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.375
I'll make you some nice butter chicken.
you'll become nice and fat.

517
00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:49.083
-I'm fine. Ma.
-"I'm fine. Ma."

518
00:33:49.166 --> 00:33:52.875
I think on that note eat a ladoo.
Take. take. take. take.

519
00:33:52.958 --> 00:33:54.416
Eat. Open your mouth.

520
00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:58.375
Now you'll have to eat plenty more.
Just you wait!

521
00:33:58.458 --> 00:34:00.916
I'll make nice food for you.

522
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.250
-I missed you so much.
-I missed you too. Ma.

523
00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:07.666
-How's Dad?
-Dad? Dad's OK.

524
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.125
Just the way he is. [laughs]

525
00:34:11.208 --> 00:34:13.291
Baby. now you should get married.

526
00:34:13.375 --> 00:34:17.333
-You should get married now.
-Ma. about that…

527
00:34:18.625 --> 00:34:20.875
I want to make you meet someone.

528
00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:25.500
Good afternoon. Ma.

529
00:34:34.291 --> 00:34:36.166
Who is she?

530
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.458
She's my girlfriend.

531
00:34:40.916 --> 00:34:45.000
You mean a girl who's a friend
or someone you work with?

532
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:49.041
Ma. come on. You know what I mean.

533
00:34:50.125 --> 00:34:52.625
She's the girl who I want to marry.

534
00:34:52.708 --> 00:34:54.583
Are you serious?

535
00:34:56.625 --> 00:34:59.291
She can't look after you the way I have.

536
00:34:59.375 --> 00:35:02.166
Can she make chola bhaturas
like I make for you?

537
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.625
-Ma. please don't.
-Don't be silly. No. this is madness.

538
00:35:05.791 --> 00:35:07.916
No. No means no.

539
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.291
[Hindi] I'm going to the kitchen
to take out your jalebi.

540
00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:12.583
-Ma.
-No. this can't happen.

541
00:35:15.208 --> 00:35:17.125
-I'll talk--
-Didn't prep my parents. huh?

542
00:35:28.625 --> 00:35:31.583
And I thought it was Nigerian
mothers-in-law that were dramatic.

543
00:35:31.666 --> 00:35:33.250
-Huh.
-Hmm.

544
00:35:33.333 --> 00:35:35.958
Trust me. Raj's mum…

545
00:35:37.291 --> 00:35:38.541
takes the trophy.

546
00:35:38.625 --> 00:35:40.125
-Didi?
-Hmm?

547
00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:43.041
Are you sure he didn't say anything
to his mother?

548
00:35:43.125 --> 00:35:45.875
Nada. He was just quiet.

549
00:35:47.708 --> 00:35:51.875
Be careful. It's like you have
a mother's boy on your hands.

550
00:35:51.958 --> 00:35:57.083
I mean. to be fair. I didn't really stick
up for him either with my dad. so…

551
00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.791
Didi.

552
00:36:00.833 --> 00:36:03.375
Then fair is fair.

553
00:36:03.458 --> 00:36:05.125
I'm just saying…

554
00:36:06.041 --> 00:36:08.750
Didn't you say him and Leila are cousins?

555
00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:12.458
And talk to her now.
Maybe she can help you guys.

556
00:36:13.625 --> 00:36:17.166
-Just try.
-I don't know if she can help.

557
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.791
-I guess I can give it a shot.
-There you go.

558
00:36:19.875 --> 00:36:22.333
I missed my food. Normally I don't like…

559
00:36:22.416 --> 00:36:25.166
[phone ringing]

560
00:36:26.625 --> 00:36:28.250
[Pidgin] What's up?

561
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.041
What?

562
00:36:31.125 --> 00:36:33.958
Oh. my goodn-- Where is she?
Where is she now?

563
00:36:49.208 --> 00:36:51.041
How is she?

564
00:36:56.958 --> 00:36:59.791
What? Who did this?

565
00:37:00.916 --> 00:37:03.791
It's a new client of hers.
He took her to a hotel.

566
00:37:03.875 --> 00:37:07.375
He… He tried to…

567
00:37:08.833 --> 00:37:11.083
touch me. but…

568
00:37:11.166 --> 00:37:13.666
Jane. you don't have to.

569
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.125
But I didn't let him.

570
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.041
That's…

571
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:24.291
That made him really angry.

572
00:37:25.833 --> 00:37:29.500
So he started beating me.

573
00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:34.333
Kicking me.

574
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.041
Hitting me all over my face.

575
00:37:40.583 --> 00:37:43.166
He hit my nose.

576
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.791
He was calling me all sorts of names.

577
00:37:51.791 --> 00:37:54.708
And then he pushed me to the ground.

578
00:37:55.958 --> 00:37:58.666
And he tried to get on top of me.

579
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.041
Did he…?

580
00:38:07.791 --> 00:38:08.833
No.

581
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:17.916
I think he…
He enjoyed beating me more.

582
00:38:18.958 --> 00:38:21.583
He's not going to get away with this.

583
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.166
I promise you.

584
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:26.833
[Didi] OK.

585
00:38:40.166 --> 00:38:43.000
[phone ringing]

586
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:49.708
-Hey. Angie.
-Finally. Didi. What happened to you?

587
00:38:49.791 --> 00:38:52.958
I've been trying to call you and you
haven't been picking up your phone.

588
00:38:53.041 --> 00:38:54.458
I've been worried.

589
00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:58.625
I sent you a message now.
but I was still at the hospital.

590
00:38:58.708 --> 00:39:02.333
Didi. You know Raj is really worried
about you. right?

591
00:39:02.416 --> 00:39:05.000
He's been trying to call you.
he's calling me.

592
00:39:05.083 --> 00:39:07.375
Just. can you call him. please?

593
00:39:08.541 --> 00:39:09.833
And tell him what?

594
00:39:09.916 --> 00:39:14.041
You know. tell him something.
Tell him you wanna elope.

595
00:39:14.125 --> 00:39:16.375
I… Tell him you want to see him.

596
00:39:16.458 --> 00:39:20.250
Just call him and tell him something.
please. OK?

597
00:39:21.375 --> 00:39:23.125
You're crazy.

598
00:39:30.375 --> 00:39:33.166
I never wanted him to come and work
in another country.

599
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:36.083
[man] Are we really going
to go over this again?

600
00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:38.583
Give the guy a break. He's a grownup.

601
00:39:38.666 --> 00:39:40.458
Over my dead body.

602
00:39:40.541 --> 00:39:42.708
So she's a Nigerian girl.
What's wrong with that?

603
00:39:42.791 --> 00:39:43.916
Thanks. Dad.

604
00:39:46.458 --> 00:39:48.583
[phone ringing]

605
00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:53.000
Did you just say what's wrong?
Did you just say what's wrong with that?

606
00:39:53.083 --> 00:39:55.250
Have you gone completely mad?

607
00:39:56.625 --> 00:40:00.125
See. she's calling.
See that smile on his face.

608
00:40:00.208 --> 00:40:01.791
She's taken my son!

609
00:40:01.875 --> 00:40:04.416
Meera. why are you being so dramatic?

610
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.958
Come on. Meera. leave the guy alone.

611
00:40:07.041 --> 00:40:09.166
Don't "come on. Meera" me!

612
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.958
You never help. I don't even know
why I called you. Such a waste of time.

613
00:40:13.041 --> 00:40:15.416
You're of no help!

614
00:40:26.625 --> 00:40:28.375
At least this is always the same.

615
00:40:28.458 --> 00:40:32.750
[Didi] Hey.
Sorry I didn't take your calls.

616
00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:36.916
It's OK. As long as you're not
breaking up with me.

617
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
-Of course not.
-[sighs] That's a relief.

618
00:40:43.041 --> 00:40:46.208
I thought you were ignoring me
because of the way my mum treated you.

619
00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:49.250
I'm sorry. I should have said something
in your defense.

620
00:40:49.333 --> 00:40:52.083
but I was caught completely off guard.

621
00:40:53.125 --> 00:40:56.583
Well… My dad didn't treat you
any better.

622
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:03.208
I know. but give me some time
and I'll charm my way into his heart.

623
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.583
Just like I did yours.

624
00:41:07.291 --> 00:41:11.375
How? Are you going to sing to him
like you did me?

625
00:41:13.041 --> 00:41:16.250
I could try. Except we aren't
in a Bollywood movie.

626
00:41:34.375 --> 00:41:36.208
[Didi] Good morning. Dad.

627
00:41:37.375 --> 00:41:39.750
What is good about this morning?

628
00:41:39.833 --> 00:41:42.291
Chidinma. what is this?

629
00:41:44.166 --> 00:41:45.916
It's a suit.

630
00:41:46.875 --> 00:41:48.458
Against Raymond Uchenna Nwachukwu.

631
00:41:48.541 --> 00:41:52.041
And you are the prosecuting lawyer?
My own daughter?

632
00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:56.208
I know. That's actually
what I came to talk to you about.

633
00:41:57.083 --> 00:42:00.750
Daddy… He assaulted my client.

634
00:42:00.833 --> 00:42:03.875
Do you have any idea
whose son that boy is?

635
00:42:04.916 --> 00:42:09.666
Well. he's a spoilt. entitled brat who--

636
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.875
Whose father is Chief Jason Nwachukwu.

637
00:42:12.958 --> 00:42:15.125
Managing Director of Deville Enterprises.

638
00:42:15.708 --> 00:42:17.583
One of our biggest clients.

639
00:42:17.666 --> 00:42:21.083
You will drop this case immediately. Here.

640
00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:26.583
-I can't do that.
-Oh. yes. you can. You are my daughter.

641
00:42:26.666 --> 00:42:30.666
Yes. and you didn't teach me
to walk away from doing the right thing.

642
00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:40.958
You do know that I will be
handling this case personally. right?

643
00:42:43.208 --> 00:42:46.625
Then I guess you will have me
to contend with.

644
00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:51.458
That will be a major conflict of interest.

645
00:42:51.541 --> 00:42:55.166
And as your boss I'm asking you
to withdraw the case immediately.

646
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:56.250
Now take it.

647
00:42:56.333 --> 00:42:58.208
Well. Dad. in that case. I quit.

648
00:43:00.083 --> 00:43:04.166
I'm not dropping this case.
Not until I see that monster punished

649
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.291
for what he did.

650
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:30.791
[Meera] You slept well. baby?
You're not eating breakfast. come on.

651
00:43:30.875 --> 00:43:32.625
Eat properly.

652
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.625
Who takes care of you when I'm not here.
hmm?

653
00:43:37.708 --> 00:43:39.708
-Who cooks for you?
-I cook. Ma.

654
00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:41.416
-Really?
-I do.

655
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.541
Why do I find that so hard to believe?

656
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:47.166
Hey! Mama!

657
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:49.291
[Meera] Emma! How is my baby?

658
00:43:49.375 --> 00:43:50.666
[Emma] Good.

659
00:43:51.208 --> 00:43:52.750
-How are you doing?
-I'm good. Good to see you.

660
00:43:52.833 --> 00:43:54.541
-I made some breakfast.
-[Emma] Oh!

661
00:43:54.625 --> 00:43:57.500
He knows. Ma.
He smelled it across the hall.

662
00:43:57.583 --> 00:43:58.666
Look at you!

663
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:03.708
No. I was just passing and I said.
let me come and greet Mummy.

664
00:44:03.791 --> 00:44:05.458
-You know?
-Come on.

665
00:44:05.541 --> 00:44:08.208
-But if you insist…
-Yeah. of course I'm insisting.

666
00:44:08.291 --> 00:44:11.458
You're my son.
Don't start pulling his leg.

667
00:44:15.833 --> 00:44:18.000
Mm. this Indian food is working-o!

668
00:44:18.083 --> 00:44:20.708
Thank you so much. You like it?

669
00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:22.916
You're enjoying!

670
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.666
So nice to see you both eat.

671
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.333
[sighs]

672
00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:30.541
-Ma?
-Mm.

673
00:44:31.791 --> 00:44:33.875
We need to talk about Didi.

674
00:44:34.666 --> 00:44:38.666
There's this friend of mine. her daughter
Sunita. She has become so beautiful.

675
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:40.000
-Ma.
-And so pretty.

676
00:44:40.083 --> 00:44:42.250
Ma. I don't want to talk about Sunita.

677
00:44:42.333 --> 00:44:44.750
OK. so we talk about other options.
No problem.

678
00:44:44.833 --> 00:44:48.375
Come on. Ma. Don't tell me you have
a book of some single eligible ladies.

679
00:44:48.458 --> 00:44:52.583
Well. it's 2020 and I have an app. See?

680
00:44:52.666 --> 00:44:53.833
Ma. please stop.

681
00:44:56.291 --> 00:44:57.916
Yesterday…

682
00:44:58.916 --> 00:45:01.958
-Whatever--
-I don't want to talk about anyone!

683
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:04.458
[sobs] Don't talk to me!

684
00:45:04.541 --> 00:45:06.166
Ma. don't cry now!

685
00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:09.250
-[Pidgin] What've you done now?
-I didn't mean to upset her.

686
00:45:09.333 --> 00:45:11.583
-She's upset.
-But I need to talk about Didi.

687
00:45:11.666 --> 00:45:14.000
-[Meera sobs]
-Ma.

688
00:45:14.083 --> 00:45:16.791
-What "ma."
-Mummy. Mummy.

689
00:45:20.291 --> 00:45:23.458
-He doesn't listen to me.
-You don't listen! Why don't you listen?

690
00:45:35.208 --> 00:45:38.541
[Pidgin] Please!
It's not as if someone died.

691
00:45:41.583 --> 00:45:44.916
Your parents don't want you to be
together. Is it the end of the world?

692
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.625
Maybe you should move on.

693
00:45:46.708 --> 00:45:51.208
Wow! I actually thought you were gonna
say something smart. but--

694
00:45:51.291 --> 00:45:52.875
That was smart.

695
00:45:53.625 --> 00:45:57.208
OK. You guys. seriously.

696
00:45:57.291 --> 00:46:00.333
can we just stand up and go somewhere.
what is all this?

697
00:46:00.416 --> 00:46:02.875
You do look like somebody has died.
Stand up. let's go out.

698
00:46:02.958 --> 00:46:04.291
-What is this now?
-Where?

699
00:46:04.375 --> 00:46:07.083
At least somewhere
that is more fun than here.

700
00:46:07.166 --> 00:46:11.625
-Hey! Now it's like your brain works.
-It works.

701
00:46:11.708 --> 00:46:13.916
Let's go out. Let's go and. you know…

702
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.916
-Shake booty.
-Some fun and just…

703
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.958
Bump body. Ah. eh!

704
00:46:19.041 --> 00:46:22.875
No. no. not you! Them. OK?

705
00:46:24.083 --> 00:46:26.458
-Now. stand up. Stand up.
-Let's go.

706
00:46:26.541 --> 00:46:28.791
-[Angie] You know me. I will drag you.
-Let's go!

707
00:46:28.875 --> 00:46:30.625
[Angie] I will drag you up!

708
00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:33.666
[party music]

709
00:46:58.375 --> 00:47:01.458
[party music continues]

710
00:47:16.458 --> 00:47:20.416
[party music continues]

711
00:47:38.208 --> 00:47:41.541
[party music continues]

712
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:19.166
[no dialogue]

713
00:48:23.791 --> 00:48:26.916
[Didi] Sorry. so sorry. Sorry I'm late.

714
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.916
I just… I just had a rough morning.

715
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.583
You didn't tell me your dad's
representing Raymond.

716
00:48:34.666 --> 00:48:36.166
-Doesn't matter.
-You sure?

717
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.416
Yes. Come on. let's go.

718
00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:40.416
Are you OK?

719
00:48:44.041 --> 00:48:46.500
-Are you nervous?
-No.

720
00:48:53.416 --> 00:48:55.208
They're keeping us waiting on purpose.

721
00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:58.791
It's a tactic to unnerve us.

722
00:49:00.125 --> 00:49:01.708
They do it all the time.

723
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.125
[door opening]

724
00:49:04.208 --> 00:49:07.291
[low-level chatter]

725
00:49:08.833 --> 00:49:10.708
Hello. Didi.

726
00:49:10.791 --> 00:49:16.041
You mean "good morning. Miss Nwigwe."
This is not a family meeting.

727
00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:21.583
Hello. Barrister Nwigwe.

728
00:49:21.666 --> 00:49:24.750
Didn't recognize you without
your Tikka Masala boyfriend.

729
00:49:24.833 --> 00:49:26.958
Morning. Miss Daniels.

730
00:49:27.708 --> 00:49:30.500
My client and I would appreciate
not being kept waiting.

731
00:49:31.125 --> 00:49:32.291
It's not without due cause.

732
00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:35.041
With or without due cause.
it is professional ethics

733
00:49:35.125 --> 00:49:38.375
and courtesy to inform us and apologize.

734
00:49:39.416 --> 00:49:42.791
I think you should worry about
your client's case

735
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:47.208
and less about an apology.

736
00:49:47.916 --> 00:49:50.791
You weren't much of a lawyer
when you were here.

737
00:49:50.875 --> 00:49:55.625
I doubt you'll be much of a lawyer
on the opposite side of the table either.

738
00:49:59.958 --> 00:50:01.791
Shall we proceed?

739
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:13.625
After an apology is tended
for keeping us waiting.

740
00:50:13.708 --> 00:50:16.291
then we will proceed.

741
00:50:22.625 --> 00:50:26.916
OK. we apologize. Miss Nwigwe.

742
00:50:29.791 --> 00:50:31.500
Thank you.

743
00:50:31.583 --> 00:50:33.958
We may proceed.

744
00:50:38.625 --> 00:50:43.416
We're here today because your client.
Mr. Raymond Uche Nwachukwu.

745
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:46.833
assaulted my client. Jane Odoh.

746
00:50:46.916 --> 00:50:50.166
on the 26th of April
at the Sky Towers Hotel.

747
00:50:50.875 --> 00:50:55.625
We are suing for assault and harassment
to the tune of 50 million naira.

748
00:51:14.583 --> 00:51:17.500
Your client assaulted?

749
00:51:18.916 --> 00:51:20.375
No.

750
00:51:20.458 --> 00:51:24.375
Your client attempted to kill our client.

751
00:51:24.458 --> 00:51:30.291
He's fine with overlooking her folly
and not counter-suing

752
00:51:30.375 --> 00:51:32.250
if you drop the case.

753
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:38.208
Otherwise. she may be
looking at jail time.

754
00:51:40.416 --> 00:51:41.916
For attempted murder.

755
00:51:47.916 --> 00:51:51.958
Like I said. not much of a lawyer.

756
00:51:52.916 --> 00:51:54.583
Anywhere.

757
00:52:05.041 --> 00:52:06.625
[Didi] You should have told me.

758
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.250
-I didn't think it mattered.
-How could it not matter?

759
00:52:10.333 --> 00:52:11.583
You stabbed him!

760
00:52:11.666 --> 00:52:14.416
I barely scratched his hand.
It was self-defense.

761
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:17.416
And then he beat you. How?

762
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:20.458
No. tell me. how did he beat you
with a knife wound?

763
00:52:20.541 --> 00:52:23.375
-You think I'm lying.
-You lied to me the first time.

764
00:52:23.458 --> 00:52:25.916
How am I supposed to know what to think?

765
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.833
I didn't lie to you. I only didn't
tell you that I wounded him.

766
00:52:28.916 --> 00:52:31.583
-Why?
-Because of this.

767
00:52:31.666 --> 00:52:35.791
I didn't want you to doubt my innocence
or think that I brought this on myself.

768
00:52:36.833 --> 00:52:39.083
Jane. you should have still told us.

769
00:52:39.166 --> 00:52:42.916
I didn't want to disappoint you by telling
you that I still had the pocketknife.

770
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.750
plus it's illegal to have a pocketknife.

771
00:52:46.291 --> 00:52:49.708
But… I need it for situations like this.

772
00:52:51.958 --> 00:52:54.500
[phone ringing]

773
00:52:55.458 --> 00:52:58.333
We'll figure something out.
Don't worry about it.

774
00:53:00.166 --> 00:53:03.625
-Hey. baby.
-[Raj] How did your case go?

775
00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:09.583
-Not so great.
-Oh.

776
00:53:09.666 --> 00:53:12.208
-I'm sorry to hear about that.
-It's OK.

777
00:53:12.291 --> 00:53:16.333
How about I help you get it out of your
mind? Come spend the weekend with me.

778
00:53:16.416 --> 00:53:19.791
Are you crazy? How about your mum?

779
00:53:19.875 --> 00:53:23.375
She's spending the weekend
with Leila's sister and her family.

780
00:53:24.916 --> 00:53:29.208
Raj. I don't know.
Let me get back to you. OK?

781
00:53:29.291 --> 00:53:31.541
OK. I'll be waiting.

782
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:37.875
Sorry about Jane. You know what
these girls are going through.

783
00:53:37.958 --> 00:53:40.083
She just didn't think we'd believe her.

784
00:53:40.833 --> 00:53:43.125
What are we gonna do?

785
00:53:43.208 --> 00:53:44.791
Raymond has a case.

786
00:53:46.416 --> 00:53:52.000
But if we can prove that Jane did it
out of self-defense then…

787
00:53:52.083 --> 00:53:55.166
We don't have any eyewitnesses.
How are we gonna do that?

788
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.708
A hotel like that would have CCTV footage.

789
00:54:04.375 --> 00:54:05.458
That's true.

790
00:54:10.166 --> 00:54:11.916
OK. sir.

791
00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:14.541
Alright. sir.

792
00:54:16.791 --> 00:54:20.083
I'm sorry. ma'am.
he's currently unavailable.

793
00:54:20.166 --> 00:54:23.375
What do you mean he's unavailable?
You just spoke to him on the intercom.

794
00:54:23.458 --> 00:54:26.416
-Yes. ma'am. but--
-OK. it's fine.

795
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.291
If he's not available.
can I speak to the manager?

796
00:54:29.375 --> 00:54:32.833
-No. ma'am. He's also--
-Unavailable?

797
00:54:32.916 --> 00:54:34.375
Yes. ma'am.

798
00:54:35.958 --> 00:54:40.333
So you are telling me that there's no one
monitoring CCTV footage of this place?

799
00:54:40.416 --> 00:54:44.208
-There are no CCTVs in the rooms.
-Yes. but you have them on the corridors.

800
00:54:44.291 --> 00:54:47.250
Yes. but the one you are requesting
is faulty and--

801
00:54:47.333 --> 00:54:48.333
Unavailable.

802
00:55:06.375 --> 00:55:08.750
Look at the girl in this picture.

803
00:55:10.208 --> 00:55:12.000
Someone did this to her.

804
00:55:12.083 --> 00:55:13.458
Here.

805
00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:15.541
In this hotel.

806
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.708
I am trying to get justice for her.

807
00:55:20.416 --> 00:55:22.416
If this were your sister…

808
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.125
would the footage still be unavailable?

809
00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:31.791
As a woman. please help me.

810
00:55:32.666 --> 00:55:34.250
[sighs]

811
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:38.416
There was an imposing lady

812
00:55:40.166 --> 00:55:42.291
always snapping her fingers.

813
00:55:43.458 --> 00:55:45.208
She came for it.

814
00:55:45.291 --> 00:55:46.333
Preemo.

815
00:55:47.375 --> 00:55:49.541
Really. Dad?

816
00:55:50.541 --> 00:55:55.833
I mean. I know you'll go to any lengths to
win. but this? Even this is beneath you.

817
00:55:55.916 --> 00:55:59.000
Chidinma. what am I being accused of now?

818
00:55:59.083 --> 00:56:02.083
You had the footage from
the hotel corridor destroyed.

819
00:56:02.916 --> 00:56:06.750
Do you even have facts to go up against
your accusations?

820
00:56:06.833 --> 00:56:09.875
Very convenient that all of a sudden
the footage is gone.

821
00:56:11.041 --> 00:56:14.166
And I know it was by someone
in this office.

822
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:16.916
What law school did you even go to?

823
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.708
-Preemo--
-Ah!

824
00:56:18.791 --> 00:56:22.833
I'm sorry. sir. but this is conjecture.
She needs hard facts to back it up!

825
00:56:22.916 --> 00:56:26.375
I don't need hard facts! OK?

826
00:56:27.166 --> 00:56:29.458
-I know how you play.
-To win.

827
00:56:31.708 --> 00:56:33.833
See?

828
00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:36.750
That's all this is about.

829
00:56:36.833 --> 00:56:40.125
That is all this entire organization
is about.

830
00:56:40.208 --> 00:56:42.958
Hm. well. you can add making money
to the list as well.

831
00:56:43.041 --> 00:56:45.458
-Preemo.
-Sorry. sir.

832
00:56:45.541 --> 00:56:47.083
Leave us.

833
00:57:06.291 --> 00:57:07.916
She's right.

834
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:12.750
Do you know why I quit. Dad?

835
00:57:14.208 --> 00:57:17.125
It's all about money here.

836
00:57:18.375 --> 00:57:21.291
Winning. Money. winning. money. winning.

837
00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:24.083
-No respect for right or wrong!
-Enough!

838
00:57:25.666 --> 00:57:30.416
Enough. OK? Don't tell me about
what is right or wrong.

839
00:57:31.958 --> 00:57:35.875
Nobody wins a case by just being right.

840
00:57:35.958 --> 00:57:38.916
It is always about what you can prove
in a court of law.

841

That is the first thing you are taught
as a lawyer.

842
00:57:43.375 --> 00:57:47.291
And as for the money?
This is not a charity organization.

843
00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:52.250
There are people who live off the income
that we make in this establishment.

844
00:57:53.166 --> 00:57:55.583
The money that put you through school

845
00:57:56.625 --> 00:57:59.333
came from the cases that we won in here

846
00:57:59.416 --> 00:58:01.958
and the monies that paid for those wins.

847
00:58:02.041 --> 00:58:07.083
So don't you stand there and tell me about
what is right or wrong.

848
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:12.958
You know. we may be cut
from the same cloth.

849
00:58:13.041 --> 00:58:14.500
But we are not the same.

Chidinma. you are taking this thing
too far.

853

No. Mummy. I'm not. Mummy. leave it.
I'm not. it's better this way.

854
00:58:32.458 --> 00:58:33.583
How?

855
00:58:33.666 --> 00:58:36.333
I have no intention of giving up the case!

856

I can't stay here. Mummy. let me go.

What are you doing here?

Angie gave me his address.

976
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.375
The question is. what are you doing here?

977
01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:54.375
You left your home to come
and stay here with him?

978
01:10:56.166 --> 01:11:00.000
-[Didi] You know that's not how it is.
-Oh. and how is it?

979
01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:04.041
Your father is going to be so unhappy
to find out that you are here.

-Why? Just because he's not Nigerian?

[Shola] That is not the reason why.

to win your father over like this.

01:11:26.291 --> 01:11:30.666

in India.

01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:59.541
And I come from a very respectable family
here in Nigeria.

And talking about respectability.
your son has no home training.

01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:11.333
I mean. which respectable man harbors
somebody else's daughter in his apartment

999

without doing what is right by her?

1000

1001
01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:16.750
Auntie. I have full intentions
to do right by her.

1002
01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.833
Oh. really. you do?

1003
01:12:19.916 --> 01:12:22.666
By being selfish and taking advantage?

1004
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:25.458
Excuse me. my son does not
take advantage of a woman.

1005
01:12:26.541 --> 01:12:28.083
He's a very honorable man.

1006
01:12:28.166 --> 01:12:31.208
Your daughter is throwing herself
on my son.

1007
01:12:31.291 --> 01:12:33.333
-I am not!
-[Raj] Ma.

1008
01:12:33.416 --> 01:12:35.625
-Ma. please. he asked me to come here.
-Really?

1009
01:12:35.708 --> 01:12:38.541
So you fight with your father
and then stay in a man's house

1010
01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:41.125
-and you're not even married to him?
-That's not how it happened!

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:44.000
-That's enough!
-What is "Ma"?

1013
01:12:44.083 --> 01:12:49.166
Now just go in there and get your things.
This is obvious! You are not welcome here.

1014
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:50.375
Ma.

1015
01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:51.958
Didi.

1016
01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:56.541
-Ma. how can you talk like this?
-[Hindi] And whatever she says is OK?

1017
01:12:56.625 --> 01:12:59.125
Auntie. I'm very sorry.

1018
01:13:11.166 --> 01:13:13.375
-Didi.
-Don't "Didi" me.

1019
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.208
You just stood there.

1020
01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:19.625
Stood there and said nothing while
your mother accused me of being a slut.

1021
01:13:19.708 --> 01:13:22.125
-My mother didn't call you a slut.
-She did!

1022
01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:24.041
That's an exaggeration.

1023
01:13:24.125 --> 01:13:26.833
First your father insulted me.
and then your mother.

1024
01:13:26.916 --> 01:13:30.625
Both insulted me by calling me
disrespectful. dishonorable.

1025
01:13:30.708 --> 01:13:32.583
-and you didn't say anything either.
-I did.

1026
01:13:32.666 --> 01:13:36.416
-No. you didn't.
-I did! At least I tried. You didn't.

1027
01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.791
Not one word in my defense. And you're
the one who asked me to come here!

1028
01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:42.750
And you said you wouldn't.
then you show up at my door crying.

1029
01:13:42.833 --> 01:13:45.041
What was I supposed to do? Throw you out?

1030
01:13:45.125 --> 01:13:47.791
Didi. don't play some victim now.

1031
01:13:58.833 --> 01:14:00.291
You're right.

1032
01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:04.375
I'm not going to play the victim.

1033
01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:10.000
I refuse to be the victim of
your mother's disdain and insults.

-Mr. Tarun. hello.
-Hi.

1050
01:16:36.125 --> 01:16:38.625
-My name is Didi.
-Hi. Didi.

1051
01:16:38.708 --> 01:16:41.916
-I was hoping you could help me.
-Sure. what would you like?

1052
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.458
So. I've been trying to get
some footage from this hotel

1053
01:16:44.541 --> 01:16:46.916
-because I'm investigating a case--
-I'm sorry.

1054
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.333
you'll have to take that with my security
team. it's not something I deal with.

1055
01:16:50.416 --> 01:16:52.750
But they'll help you with whatever it is
that you want.

1056
01:16:52.833 --> 01:16:53.875
No. you don't understand.

1057
01:16:53.958 --> 01:16:55.458
-[phone ringing]
-Excuse me. please.

1058
01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:58.750
-[Raj] Yeah. it was very nice.
-[Leila] I enjoyed it.

1059
01:16:58.833 --> 01:17:02.708
Leila. I just have to meet someone.
I'll see you in a bit.

1060
01:17:02.791 --> 01:17:04.250
I'll go get us a table.

1061
01:17:12.541 --> 01:17:14.125
Raj!

1062
01:17:15.416 --> 01:17:16.666
Hi.

1063
01:17:17.416 --> 01:17:21.541
Raj. hey. how's it going?
Good to see you.

1064
01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:22.958
You guys know each other?

1065
01:17:23.041 --> 01:17:25.166
-Er…
-She…

1066
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:28.083
She's the woman I want to marry.

1067
01:17:28.166 --> 01:17:30.625
Wow. that's big. Congratulations. man!

1068
01:17:32.083 --> 01:17:36.208
Erm. sir. please.
I really do need your help.

1069
01:17:36.291 --> 01:17:38.583
I'm investigating this assault case

1070
01:17:38.666 --> 01:17:42.250
and that footage will go a long way
in helping my case.

1071
01:17:42.333 --> 01:17:46.333
Sir. please. can you help her?
For me. as a favor.

1072
01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:48.666
Raj. for you. you know I can do anything.

1073
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:52.875
And of course. if it happened in this
hotel. you'll get all the help you need.

1074
01:17:52.958 --> 01:17:56.125
Raj stopped me from making
a terrible investment many years ago

1075
01:17:56.208 --> 01:17:59.291
-and saved this entire company.
-Sir. I was just doing my job.

1076
01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:02.500
You saved me from a lot of wahala.
my friend.

1077
01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:05.416
But I'm gonna put you in touch
with the people in charge

1078
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:09.583
-and you'll get whatever you need.
-Thank you. Thank you very much.

1079
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:13.750
Thank you. Erm. I have to go. so…

1080
01:18:13.833 --> 01:18:17.083
Actually. Leila is with me.
she's at the restaurant.

1081
01:18:17.166 --> 01:18:19.625
-Would you like to meet her?
-Sure.

1082
01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:22.708
Er. sorry. guys. Leila from the NGO?

1083
01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:23.916
Yes.

1084
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.541
Er. do you guys mind if I join you
for a drink?

1085
01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:32.791
Of course you can join us.
it's your hotel. sir. it'd be our honor.

1086
01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.833
[low chatter]

1087
01:18:47.416 --> 01:18:52.250
So. sir. Leila… we need to talk.

1088
01:18:53.833 --> 01:18:56.125
-I hope you don't mind. sir.
-Sure. of course. please.

1089
01:18:56.208 --> 01:18:58.583
-Thank you.
-[Tarun] You guys alright?

1090
01:18:58.666 --> 01:18:59.541
[Raj] Yeah.

1091
01:19:04.208 --> 01:19:05.458
Leila.

1092
01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:09.291
-I really enjoyed your seminar.
-I'm glad. I'm glad you did.

1093
01:19:09.375 --> 01:19:11.708
I'm glad that we're having a drink
together.

1094
01:19:12.541 --> 01:19:16.041
-How long have you been here?
-My whole life. actually.

1095
01:19:17.791 --> 01:19:20.041
I just wanted to share something with you.

1096
01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:28.041
-I got you something.
-Thank you. What's the occasion?

1097
01:19:28.125 --> 01:19:32.458
I'm not gonna need to send it to your
office anymore now that I saw you here.

1098
01:19:33.458 --> 01:19:35.750
-So you're Mr. T?
-I am.

1099
01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:37.791
Ah. why the mystery?

1100
01:19:37.875 --> 01:19:40.791
I think a little old fashioned romance
never hurt anybody.

1101
01:19:41.458 --> 01:19:42.875
That's sweet.

1102
01:19:42.958 --> 01:19:46.708
I just wanted you to know how special
I thought you were before I met you.

1103
01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:48.875
Thank you. that's very nice.

1104
01:19:48.958 --> 01:19:52.166
Leila. I'm hoping to get to know you
a little bit better.

1105
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:53.583
Mm?

1106
01:19:53.666 --> 01:19:56.416
Think I can take you out for dinner
some time?

1107
01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.291
Sure. That sounds good.

1108
01:20:01.875 --> 01:20:04.416
So are you guys getting back together?

1109
01:20:06.166 --> 01:20:07.875
-I don't think so.
-Why not?

1110
01:20:09.166 --> 01:20:12.750
-It's just too much drama.
-But you love him.

1111
01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:17.791
I guess we can't overcome it all.

1112
01:20:17.875 --> 01:20:19.833
[knocking at door]

1113
01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:25.291
-See who has got another gift!
-[Leila] Thank you.

1114
01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:27.791
-Mr. T is at it again.
-At least we know who it is.

1115
01:20:27.875 --> 01:20:29.458
Yes. I do.

1116
01:20:30.375 --> 01:20:33.041
-You two enjoy your day. Bye bye.
-Bye. Cindy.

1117
01:20:34.666 --> 01:20:35.875
[Didi] Ooh!

1118
01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:38.666
Mr. Tarun at work!

1119
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:40.541
Is this love I sense in the air?

1120
01:20:40.625 --> 01:20:43.458
Actually. this looks like it's for you.

1121
01:20:53.708 --> 01:20:56.041
"I hope you get the justice
you're looking for."

1122
01:20:56.666 --> 01:20:58.708
It's the CCTV footage.

1123
01:21:03.083 --> 01:21:04.791
Now let's watch.

1124
01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:31.333
Enough.

1125
01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:34.625
Enough! I said enough.

1126
01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:40.333
How much do you want?

1127
01:21:44.375 --> 01:21:48.125
My client demands 75 million naira
in damages.

1128
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:52.125
And your client goes for
anger management classes

1129
01:21:52.208 --> 01:21:54.416
at a center of our choosing.

1130
01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.333
He cannot be late or miss a class.

1131
01:21:56.416 --> 01:21:59.625
otherwise the fee in damages
will be doubled.

1132
01:21:59.708 --> 01:22:03.750
Nonsense! 75 million naira?
Are you kidding me?

1133
01:22:03.833 --> 01:22:05.666
Shut up. Preemo!

1134
01:22:07.833 --> 01:22:10.791
We are in this mess because of you
in the first place.

1135
01:22:18.208 --> 01:22:20.875
-We accept your offer.
-What?

1136
01:22:23.833 --> 01:22:26.166
You better take care of this.

1137
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.583
Or you can kiss the Axel deal goodbye.

1138
01:22:31.666 --> 01:22:34.083
You incompetent old fool!

1139
01:22:36.333 --> 01:22:37.916
No. this is not happening.

1140
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.291
-This is not happening.
-Leave me.

1141
01:22:41.416 --> 01:22:43.875
-You'll be hearing from my father. sir.
-I'll be waiting.

1142
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.333
Preemo.

1143
01:22:58.375 --> 01:22:59.375
You're fired.

1144
01:23:00.791 --> 01:23:06.416
What? After all the money
I've made for this company?

1145
01:23:08.333 --> 01:23:11.583
I should be the one running this company.
not her!

1146
01:23:11.666 --> 01:23:13.208
[Ernest] Keep quiet.

1147
01:23:13.291 --> 01:23:15.791
This company that you
want to run so badly.

1148
01:23:15.875 --> 01:23:20.375
you made it liable by tampering with
evidence in an ongoing case!

1149
01:23:22.083 --> 01:23:25.333
I lost myself in all of this.

1150
01:23:27.083 --> 01:23:31.125
I forgot the very principles
upon which this firm was founded.

1151
01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:34.333
Now get out.

1152
01:23:39.416 --> 01:23:40.416
No.

1153
01:23:45.125 --> 01:23:47.416
You're not even a real lawyer.

1154
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.041
I couldn't have been more proud
of how you have held yourself.

1155
01:24:07.708 --> 01:24:09.416
Congratulations.

1156
01:24:16.375 --> 01:24:18.166
You did great. Didi.

1157
01:24:19.833 --> 01:24:21.750
I think your dad just paid you
a compliment.

1158
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.500
[squeals]

1159
01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:48.791
Where did you get all that money?

1160
01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:52.875
I'm now signed to Chocolate City. baby.
I made it big!

1161
01:24:52.958 --> 01:24:55.833
-Mad-o!
-Mad-o!

1162
01:25:05.125 --> 01:25:07.166
You won that case.

1163
01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:11.416
Your dad told me. [chuckles]

1164
01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.791
Yeah.

1165
01:25:14.541 --> 01:25:17.291
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1166
01:25:18.041 --> 01:25:20.833
-I had some help. though.
-Who?

1167
01:25:25.166 --> 01:25:26.541
Rajesh.

1168
01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:31.833
I thought that was over.

1169
01:25:31.916 --> 01:25:35.250
It was. It… is.

1170
01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:36.250
I…

1171
01:25:38.541 --> 01:25:40.541
I miss him.

1172
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:48.166
I love him. Mummy.

1173
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:55.041
[Yoruba] Chidinma.
you can manage a bad husband…

1174
01:25:56.416 --> 01:25:58.291
but not bad in-laws.

1175
01:25:59.166 --> 01:26:00.583
Ah.

1176
01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:05.375
Chidinma. you have to value yourself.

1177
01:26:07.083 --> 01:26:12.541
You are not only marrying Raj.
you are marrying his entire family.

1178
01:26:12.625 --> 01:26:15.333
And his mother does not like you.

1179
01:26:15.416 --> 01:26:17.166
But what about you?

1180
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:20.083
Do you like him?

1181
01:26:24.833 --> 01:26:26.166
Mummy.

1182
01:26:27.541 --> 01:26:32.041
If anybody knows exactly
what I am going through.

1183
01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:34.000
it should be you.

1184
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.875
You're a Yoruba woman
that married an Igbo man.

How can you. of all people.
not accept this?

-It's different.
-How?

1187
01:26:49.791 --> 01:26:51.333
Mummy. how?

1188
01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:54.625
You fought for the love you have today.

1189
01:26:55.333 --> 01:26:58.250
Daddy fought for you.

1190

How can you look at me and…
I don't understand.

1191
01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:08.083
Chidinma. I am trying to protect you.

1192
01:27:10.875 --> 01:27:15.875
I don't want you to go through
all of that struggle.

-And he's Indian.
-But…

But you're with Daddy today.

1196

him. He doesn't come home on time.

1198
01:27:51.625 --> 01:27:53.875
he doesn't talk to me.
he doesn't tell me anything.

1199

The poor boy is miserable.

1202
01:28:00.166 --> 01:28:02.416
Yeah. He should come back with me
and marry Sunita.

1203
01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:06.375
Meera! The young man
does not want to marry Sunita.

1204
01:28:06.458 --> 01:28:09.625
If you cannot leave him alone
to marry the woman that he wants.

1205
01:28:09.708 --> 01:28:12.083
then at least give him
the time to get over her.

1206
01:28:12.166 --> 01:28:16.125
I think I better come to Nigeria.
I am going to watch my cricket now.

-I'm OK.
-I've come to talk to you about Didi.

1213
01:28:37.875 --> 01:28:40.791
Yes. you heard Raj and Didi
are in a relationship.

1214
01:28:40.875 --> 01:28:44.666
They were in a relationship
and I heard you had a problem with it.

1215
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:47.833
Yes. I have a problem with it
because she's not Indian.

1216
01:28:47.916 --> 01:28:51.208
Auntie. what's the difference? Do you
really think being Nigerian or Indian

1217
01:28:51.291 --> 01:28:53.458
is going to affect your son's happiness?

1218
01:28:54.833 --> 01:28:57.708
No. it's not. but he's my son
and I'm possessive about him.

1219
01:28:57.791 --> 01:29:01.250
It's just two different cultures.
two different worlds coming together.

1220

1222

Do you think the women
are so different here?

1223
01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:14.250
No. Doubtful.

for Christ's sake. Come on.

1225
01:29:17.458 --> 01:29:22.333
So. Auntie. you're like my mum. Let me
tell you. I have lived here my whole life.

1226
01:29:22.416 --> 01:29:24.958
I think sometimes I'm more Nigerian
than I am Indian.

1227
01:29:25.041 --> 01:29:27.375
But the women are no different. really.

1228
01:29:27.458 --> 01:29:31.458
In fact. some of the women I meet.
they're top of their game.

1229
01:29:31.541 --> 01:29:36.916
They're professionals. they're doctors.
they're lawyers. they're businesswomen.

1230
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.208
But they haven't lost their femininity.

1231
01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:43.083
They haven't lost the fact that
they can instill values in their kids.

1232
01:29:43.166 --> 01:29:46.083
They haven't lost the fact that
they can make homes for their husbands.

1233
01:29:46.166 --> 01:29:47.875
They have so much respect
for their elders.

1234
01:29:47.958 --> 01:29:52.291
So you really are very lucky to
have somebody like Didi in your life.

1235

And Raj would be lucky to have her
as a wife.

Are you also a lawyer?

1247
01:31:40.583 --> 01:31:44.958
No. I studied business
and I worked in banking

1248
01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:47.958
and then. erm. I quit when…

-Ah! The sacrifices we make as mothers.
-Mm-hmm.

just being a mother.

very. very noble work.

1261

And by "noble" you mean?

1262

She's working in Leila's NGO.
It's commendable work she's doing.

1263
01:32:42.916 --> 01:32:46.916
What would be commendable
is for my daughter to ensure

1264

you're not a very smart man.
