00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.244
Rourke?

4
00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.182
Rourke.

5
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:24.463
Come back to us.

6
00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:30.297
Sorry.

7
00:01:30.297 --> 00:01:31.988
Drifted off for a second.

8
00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:35.095
The park?

9
00:01:39.168 --> 00:01:40.100
What about it?

10
00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:43.379
That's where you drift to.
isn't it?

11
00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:46.209
That park.

12
00:01:47.314 --> 00:01:48.660
That day.

13
00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.181
Take me back there.

14
00:01:55.184 --> 00:01:56.150
What do you see?

15
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.436
<i>Dad.</i>

16
00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:07.748
Fix my braid.

17
00:02:09.474 --> 00:02:10.544
<i>Her hair.</i>

18
00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.305
I see her hair.

19
00:02:13.305 --> 00:02:14.755
Your daughter?

20
00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:17.999
Minnie.

21
00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.209
This is not a braid.

22
00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.451
This is a maze...

23
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:24.558
that only your mother can solve.

24
00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:25.455
There you go.

25
00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:27.112
Thank you. Dad!

26
00:02:30.495 --> 00:02:33.222
<i>She was playing this game.</i>

27
00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:34.568
<i>where she would see</i>

28
00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:36.639
<i>how many times she could
spin around in one place</i>

29
00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.054
<i>before she fell over.</i>

30
00:02:39.814 --> 00:02:41.057
When did you see him?

31
00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:47.857
<i>I barely noticed him.</i>

32
00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:51.792
<i>I was just happy
to be with my daughter.</i>

33
00:02:56.383 --> 00:02:58.868
<i>I wasn't paying attention
for just...</i>

34
00:02:58.868 --> 00:03:00.387
<i>just for a second...</i>

35
00:03:02.492 --> 00:03:03.597
...and I turned around...

36
00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:07.394
<i>...and I didn't see her...</i>

37
00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:10.466
<i>...and I got up...</i>

38
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.262
<i>...and I called out for her...</i>

39
00:03:17.093 --> 00:03:18.439
...and I looked for her.

40
00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.820
and I c-- I c--

41
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.069
She was gone.

42
00:03:34.628 --> 00:03:35.594
Rourke?

43
00:03:38.632 --> 00:03:39.943
I was there.

44
00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:44.914
There was nothing you could do.

45
00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:58.168
Work?

46
00:03:58.168 --> 00:03:59.653
Uh...

47
00:03:59.653 --> 00:04:01.448
That depends on you. I guess.

48
00:04:01.448 --> 00:04:04.036
Uh. if you think
I'm ready for duty.

49
00:04:05.797 --> 00:04:07.454
Do you feel ready. emotionally?

50
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.113
I think it's the only thing
keeping me sane.

51
00:04:57.227 --> 00:04:59.644
<i>Though the missing child
has not been recovered.</i>

52
00:04:59.644 --> 00:05:01.162
<i>a suspect is in custody</i>

53
00:05:01.162 --> 00:05:02.474

61
00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:36.991
What. you lose something. compadre?

62
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:38.476
Cockroach.

63
00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:39.994
Yeah. It's a hot day.

64
00:05:39.994 --> 00:05:41.064
Damn things are everywhere.

65
00:05:42.411 --> 00:05:43.929
Hey. did you wipe your shoes?

66
00:05:55.182 --> 00:05:56.390
So how did it go in there?

67
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.426
You good?

68
00:05:57.426 --> 00:05:58.530
Yeah. No problem.

69
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.394
I'm all clear for duty.
What's the call?

70
00:06:00.394 --> 00:06:02.603
Oh. it's a fun one.

71
00:06:02.603 --> 00:06:04.294
Anonymous tip
came into dispatch.

72
00:06:04.294 --> 00:06:05.330
Blocked number.

73
00:06:07.194 --> 00:06:08.747
<i>I'm calling to report a robbery.</i>

74
00:06:08.747 --> 00:06:10.887
<i>Are you in a safe location?</i>

75
00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:11.854
<i>Nobody's safe.</i>

76
00:06:11.854 --> 00:06:13.303
Nice line.

77
00:06:13.303 --> 00:06:15.029
Just wait.

78
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.135
<i>Is this crime
currently in progress?</i>

79
00:06:17.135 --> 00:06:18.861
<i>Today. the Bank of Austin.</i>

80
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:20.966
<i>There's a safe-deposit box.</i>

81
00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:22.796
<i>Box 23.</i>

82
00:06:22.796 --> 00:06:24.314
<i>Box 2-3.
Is that the target?</i>

83
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.145
<i>Hello?</i>

84
00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:28.284
Flair for drama.

85
00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:29.941
You're thinking it's a prank.
I get it.

86
00:06:29.941 --> 00:06:30.976
That's what I thought. too.

87
00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:32.909
Except?

88
00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.428
Two armed robberies this week

89
00:06:34.428 --> 00:06:35.602
at Bank of Austin

90
00:06:35.602 --> 00:06:37.466
at branches
Houston and Amarillo.

91
00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:40.952
Both inside jobs
involving people with access.

92
00:06:40.952 --> 00:06:42.574
Both hit the safe-deposit boxes.

93
00:06:42.574 --> 00:06:44.231
but take only one box

94
00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:46.336
and no money at all.

95
00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:48.131
No shit?

96
00:06:48.131 --> 00:06:49.201
Captain put us on stakeout.

97
00:07:08.566 --> 00:07:09.498
Getting audio.

98
00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:12.501
<i>A guy goes up
to the bartender.</i>

99
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:13.916
<i>and he says.</i>

100
00:07:13.916 --> 00:07:15.469
<i>"Hey. bartender.
I got me a bet for you.</i>

101
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.747
<i>"I'm going to bet you
300 bucks</i>

102
00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:20.129
<i>that I can piss into
that glass over there.</i>

103
00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.164
<i>and not spill..."</i>

104
00:07:21.164 --> 00:07:22.442
All right. come on.
Move on.

105
00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.478
- Wait. This is a good one.
- <i>The bartender looks...</i>

106
00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:25.928
- I don't know. it.
- Hey! I said. move on.

107
00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:26.860
<i>...piss into. something like--</i>

108
00:07:31.347 --> 00:07:33.211
He pisses on the bartender.

109
00:07:33.211 --> 00:07:34.868
- No kidding.
- It's a whole thing.

110
00:07:34.868 --> 00:07:36.145
Yeah. it's a good one.

111
00:07:43.842 --> 00:07:44.878
See that guy on the bench?

112
00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.330
He looks familiar.

113
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.815
<i>No. No.</i>

114
00:07:50.815 --> 00:07:51.816
<i>The city contracts.</i>

115
00:07:51.816 --> 00:07:53.507
You know this guy?

116
00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:55.060
-  <i>Thanks.</i>
- Not sure.

117
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.992
<i>Do you have a lighter?</i>

118
00:07:58.892 --> 00:08:00.203
Quite masculine.

119
00:08:00.203 --> 00:08:01.481
Is it yours?

120
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.999
My husband gave it to me.

121
00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:03.931
I don't smoke.

122
00:08:05.312 --> 00:08:07.521
He's got you
under his spell. doesn't he?

123
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:08.695
Yes. he does.

124
00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:13.216
It's very hot today.

125
00:08:15.702 --> 00:08:16.772
<i>I didn't notice.</i>

126
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:19.671
Trust me. it's like a furnace.

127
00:08:24.365 --> 00:08:25.884
Great. We got the weather.

128
00:08:25.884 --> 00:08:27.196
Can we move on now?

129
00:08:27.196 --> 00:08:28.093
That guy's up to something.

130
00:08:28.093 --> 00:08:29.405
Zoom in.

131
00:08:33.236 --> 00:08:35.135
<i>It's a sunny day.</i>

132
00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:38.069
You see that?

133
00:08:38.069 --> 00:08:39.242
He's speaking in code.

134
00:08:40.934 --> 00:08:42.314
The guards are in on it.

135
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:44.938
Hey! Rourke! Wait!

136
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:49.943
So hot.

137
00:08:53.671 --> 00:08:55.258
He's going for the bank.

138
00:08:55.258 --> 00:08:56.639
Don't walk into
that bank. Rourke.

139
00:08:57.675 --> 00:08:58.917
<i>We don't know
if that's the guy.</i>

140
00:09:00.609 --> 00:09:02.058
It's like a furnace.

141
00:09:04.682 --> 00:09:06.062
<i>Watch the woman.</i>

142
00:09:06.062 --> 00:09:07.408
I'll send back-up.

143
00:09:07.408 --> 00:09:08.755
Do not follow.

144
00:09:08.755 --> 00:09:09.825
<i>Yeah. roger that.</i>

145
00:09:17.936 --> 00:09:19.489
Danny. get out of that bank.

146
00:09:21.284 --> 00:09:22.389
Can I help you. sir?

147
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:23.942
<i>I repeat. do not break--</i>

148
00:09:27.774 --> 00:09:30.949
You know I'd like to open
a safe-deposit box.

149
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:32.019
<i>Right this way.</i>

150
00:09:37.646 --> 00:09:39.095
It's so hot.

151
00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:40.303
It's like a furnace.

152
00:10:00.323 --> 00:10:01.946
If you just fill this out.

153
00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:03.223
we'll get you set right up.

154
00:10:04.534 --> 00:10:06.260
Shoot. Excuse me.

155
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.814
I must have left
my keys in my office.

156
00:10:07.814 --> 00:10:08.815
I'll be right back.

157
00:10:08.815 --> 00:10:09.850
Thank you.

158
00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:17.513
Here you go.
Have a great day.

159
00:10:22.104 --> 00:10:23.001
Good morning. sir.

160
00:10:24.278 --> 00:10:25.625
Morning?

161
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.591
It's late afternoon.

162
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:32.873
It is late afternoon.

163
00:10:53.238 --> 00:10:54.239
Minnie.

164
00:11:17.504 --> 00:11:18.436
Stop. Police.

165
00:11:20.887 --> 00:11:21.957
Stop.

166
00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:27.100
I said. stop where you are.

167
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.135
Stop!

168
00:12:04.447 --> 00:12:05.345
Oh. shit!

169
00:12:44.936 --> 00:12:46.593
- Rourke!
- Send back-up!

170
00:12:46.593 --> 00:12:47.974
Go. Go!

171
00:13:13.723 --> 00:13:14.690
Do you mind?

172
00:13:30.016 --> 00:13:31.086
Stop!

173
00:13:45.997 --> 00:13:47.171
Hands up. asshole!

174
00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:48.344
Don't move!

175
00:13:49.967 --> 00:13:50.899
Cuff him.

176
00:13:59.562 --> 00:14:01.426
What are you waiting for?
Cuff him.

177
00:14:02.531 --> 00:14:03.566
But I'm the wrong man.

178
00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:10.435
He's the wrong man.

179
00:14:10.435 --> 00:14:11.471
What?

180
00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:15.578
You crooked bastards.
Who do you work for?

181
00:14:15.578 --> 00:14:17.753
Don't blame them. Detective.

182
00:14:17.753 --> 00:14:19.789
They're no more
conscious of themselves

183
00:14:19.789 --> 00:14:22.275
than Lyle Terry was.

184
00:14:26.348 --> 00:14:27.659
That was his name. wasn't it?

185
00:14:29.213 --> 00:14:31.871
The pawn who took your queen.

186
00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:34.080
Where is she?

187
00:14:40.638 --> 00:14:41.811
Give that to me.

188
00:14:43.054 --> 00:14:44.780
Where is she?
What does it mean?

189
00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.643
Who's Lev Dellrayne?

190
00:14:47.403 --> 00:14:48.404
What the hell?

191
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.132
Clean this up. detectives.

192
00:14:56.412 --> 00:14:57.931
No!

193
00:15:18.296 --> 00:15:19.263
Nobody saw him flee the scene?

194
00:15:20.471 --> 00:15:21.990
We put out an APB.
Still nothing.

195
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.061
The guards? Crew?

196
00:15:24.061 --> 00:15:25.683
Teller woman?
Anything?

197
00:15:25.683 --> 00:15:26.822
The ones that survive

198
00:15:26.822 --> 00:15:29.790
claim they can't
remember anything.

199
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:30.688
Just like Lyle Terry.

200
00:15:30.688 --> 00:15:31.620
Danny.

201
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.793
He said his name. Nicks.

202
00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:35.935
He had this picture
of my daughter

203
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.695
in a safe-deposit box.

204
00:15:37.695 --> 00:15:39.007
You want to explain that to me?

205
00:15:40.249 --> 00:15:41.388
All right. That story
was all over the news.

206
00:15:42.631 --> 00:15:44.357
A cop's kid gets abducted.

207
00:15:45.772 --> 00:15:47.084
For all we know.
this is some sick joke.

208
00:15:47.084 --> 00:15:49.983
Someone messing with you.
messing with us.

209
00:15:49.983 --> 00:15:51.951
Hell. our own guys
were in on this one.

210
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.539
I saw the way he looked at me.

211
00:15:54.539 --> 00:15:55.575
He knows.

212
00:15:57.197 --> 00:15:58.612
He knows where my daughter is.

213
00:15:58.612 --> 00:15:59.544
I'm sure of it.

214
00:16:04.377 --> 00:16:05.343
All right.

215
00:16:06.517 --> 00:16:08.346
How do we catch the bastard?

216
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.072
Hey. What's up?

217
00:16:44.072 --> 00:16:46.039
Promise me I'm not an idiot
for trusting you.

218
00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:47.834
What do you got?

219
00:16:47.834 --> 00:16:50.561
That call that came in.
that tipped us to the bank?

220
00:16:50.561 --> 00:16:52.252
Blocked number. no I.D.?

221
00:16:52.252 --> 00:16:53.943
Ran a trace.

222
00:16:53.943 --> 00:16:54.875
We got an address.

223
00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:56.084
Oh.

224
00:16:56.084 --> 00:16:57.533
<i>A storefront out on Chapel.</i>

225
00:16:57.533 --> 00:16:58.879
I shouldn't be
doing this. Rourke.

226
00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:00.364
<i>I haven't even
told the Cap yet.</i>

227
00:17:00.364 --> 00:17:01.744
Text it to me.
I'll be right there.

228
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.060
<i>The call came from
the phone of Diana Cruz.</i>

229
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.786
<i>a dime-store psychic</i>

230
00:17:08.786 --> 00:17:11.030
<i>with a few arrests
for mail fraud.</i>

231
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.272
<i>No convictions.</i>

232
00:17:18.865 --> 00:17:20.867
You're in front of the house.

233
00:17:20.867 --> 00:17:23.007
You go up the steps.

234
00:17:25.423 --> 00:17:27.253
You step through the door...

235
00:17:27.253 --> 00:17:28.771
and you see her there.

236
00:17:30.566 --> 00:17:33.190
She's holding
something in her arms.

237
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.399
It's a baby.

238
00:17:35.399 --> 00:17:36.572
She's holding you.

239
00:17:40.369 --> 00:17:41.612
I love you. Mama.

240
00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:45.098
I'm sorry.

241
00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.655
Is it over?

242
00:17:50.655 --> 00:17:52.485
What happened?

243
00:17:52.485 --> 00:17:54.107
- We have company.

244
00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.730
Good evening. ma'am.

245
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.731
Austin Police Department.

246
00:17:57.731 --> 00:17:58.974
I'd like to speak with you.

247
00:17:58.974 --> 00:17:59.906
How can I help you. Officer?

248
00:17:59.906 --> 00:18:01.666
Detective. actually.

249
00:18:01.666 --> 00:18:03.461
and. uh...

250
00:18:03.461 --> 00:18:04.428
Hello.

251
00:18:05.774 --> 00:18:07.396
This piggy bothering you. Di?

252
00:18:07.396 --> 00:18:09.329
It's cool. Tiny.

253
00:18:09.329 --> 00:18:10.641
I can handle him.

254
00:18:12.608 --> 00:18:13.678
I'll be outside.

255
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.272
I'll just take
a few minutes of your time.

256
00:18:22.756 --> 00:18:24.172
Sure.

257
00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:37.392
He'll be out there on his bike
until you leave.

258
00:18:38.496 --> 00:18:40.429
Oh. Loyal customer.

259
00:18:40.429 --> 00:18:42.328
I inspire that in people.

260
00:18:42.328 --> 00:18:45.054
Detective Rourke. isn't it?

261
00:18:45.054 --> 00:18:47.056
Well. that's
some impressive mind-reading.

262
00:18:47.056 --> 00:18:48.506
I just read the news.

263
00:18:49.714 --> 00:18:51.199
You're the one
who lost his kid.

264
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.719
Must have been awful.

265
00:18:54.719 --> 00:18:58.620
If you're open to a session.
hypnosis can be therapeutic.

266
00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.862
Confronting the past.

267
00:18:59.862 --> 00:19:02.313
I'm interested in your past.

268
00:19:02.313 --> 00:19:04.073
Diana Cruz.

269
00:19:04.073 --> 00:19:07.042
accused of bilking clients
in Laredo. San Antonio.

270
00:19:07.042 --> 00:19:08.837
Packed up shop
and moved down here.

271
00:19:08.837 --> 00:19:10.287
Those charges were lies.

272
00:19:10.287 --> 00:19:12.289
I'm not bunko. Okay?

273
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:13.566
I'm not here to bust you.

274
00:19:13.566 --> 00:19:15.084
I just want to know

275
00:19:15.084 --> 00:19:16.396
how a two-bit con artist
like you

276
00:19:16.396 --> 00:19:18.260
got involved with Lev Dellrayne.

277
00:19:19.641 --> 00:19:21.229
I know you called the tip in
on the bank heist.

278
00:19:31.756 --> 00:19:32.895
Did you catch someone?

279
00:19:32.895 --> 00:19:33.793
Not yet.
They got away.

280
00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:36.105
Then you need to leave.

281
00:19:37.383 --> 00:19:38.487
Why don't you come
to the station with me?

282
00:19:38.487 --> 00:19:39.764
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

283
00:19:39.764 --> 00:19:41.180
Then get out.

284
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.320
- I can see you're afraid--
- Get the hell out of here.

285
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.597
You know what?

286
00:19:44.597 --> 00:19:45.770
Why don't you tell me
what you're afraid of?

287
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.772
You stay. I'm out.

288
00:19:47.772 --> 00:19:48.877
I can protect you.

289
00:19:48.877 --> 00:19:50.050
You don't know anything.

290
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.431
I know I saw him at the bank.
Didn't I?

291
00:19:52.777 --> 00:19:54.054
Lev Dellrayne.

292
00:20:04.133 --> 00:20:05.859
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

293
00:20:05.859 --> 00:20:07.344
Thank you.

294
00:20:07.344 --> 00:20:08.793
He was sent to kill us.

295
00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:11.520
Who are you?

296
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.418
Hey!

297
00:20:15.248 --> 00:20:16.732
He won't tell you anything.

298
00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:18.665
I can be
pretty persuasive myself.

299
00:20:23.636 --> 00:20:25.120
He...

300
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.432
won't...

301
00:20:26.432 --> 00:20:27.605
stop.

302
00:20:50.732 --> 00:20:52.665
I didn't think
you were arresting me.

303
00:20:52.665 --> 00:20:54.149
I'm not.

304
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:55.633
We use this
for storage nowadays.

305
00:20:55.633 --> 00:20:56.772
You'll be safe here.

306
00:20:56.772 --> 00:20:59.258
Nicks. run the vic's I.D...

307
00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:00.604
Look for past gang affiliations.

308
00:21:00.604 --> 00:21:01.846
former cellmates.

309
00:21:01.846 --> 00:21:03.641
There's got to be
some connection to Dellrayne.

310
00:21:03.641 --> 00:21:04.504
All we've got to do is find it.

311
00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:12.201
Let's keep her
out of it for now.

312
00:21:12.201 --> 00:21:14.273
The Captain
will be asking questions.

313
00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.653
Tell her I'm working on it.

314
00:21:17.483 --> 00:21:20.658
We're going to run priors
on your biker friend.

315
00:21:20.658 --> 00:21:22.626
Whatever connection he has
or link to Dellrayne.

316
00:21:22.626 --> 00:21:23.696
I'm sure it will come up.

317
00:21:23.696 --> 00:21:25.111
You won't find anything.

318
00:21:25.111 --> 00:21:27.113
You might be surprised.

319
00:21:27.113 --> 00:21:29.322
You think learning who he is
will tell you why he did it?

320
00:21:29.322 --> 00:21:30.979
What other motive is there?

321
00:21:32.946 --> 00:21:34.603
What makes four total strangers

322
00:21:34.603 --> 00:21:37.537
pull off an elaborate
bank heist on a whim?

323
00:21:40.022 --> 00:21:41.507
I'm guessing you're going
to say Lev Dellrayne.

324
00:21:42.715 --> 00:21:43.819
Why don't you tell me who he is?

325
00:21:43.819 --> 00:21:45.165
What does he have
on these people?

326
00:21:45.165 --> 00:21:46.339
Are you familiar

327
00:21:46.339 --> 00:21:48.376
with the concept
of hypnotic constructs?

328
00:21:50.723 --> 00:21:53.035
Look. lady. come on.

329
00:21:53.035 --> 00:21:55.348
First. it's. uh.
fortune telling.

330
00:21:55.348 --> 00:21:56.453
Now it's hypnosis.

331
00:21:56.453 --> 00:21:58.075
- I--
- It's not hypnosis.

332
00:21:59.456 --> 00:22:00.733
Hypnotics have abilities

333
00:22:00.733 --> 00:22:02.700
far beyond anything
we have a name for.

334
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.874
"Hypnotics"?

335
00:22:03.874 --> 00:22:05.634
People with the ability

336
00:22:05.634 --> 00:22:09.362
to actually influence the brain
over a psychic bandwidth.

337
00:22:09.362 --> 00:22:10.639
Like telepathy?

338
00:22:10.639 --> 00:22:12.365
Telepaths just read the mind.

339
00:22:12.365 --> 00:22:14.402
Hypnotics reshape its reality.

340
00:22:15.886 --> 00:22:17.508
The guy at the bank.

341
00:22:17.508 --> 00:22:20.994
you said he spoke four words
to a woman and she undressed.

342
00:22:20.994 --> 00:22:22.927
Because she was in on it.

343
00:22:22.927 --> 00:22:24.032
No.

344
00:22:24.032 --> 00:22:26.483
Those were cues--

345
00:22:26.483 --> 00:22:28.968
sound. voice. locking eyes.

346
00:22:30.107 --> 00:22:31.039
Hypnotics use them

347
00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:32.247
to make you see

348
00:22:32.247 --> 00:22:34.283
a version of the world
that doesn't exist.

349
00:22:35.595 --> 00:22:38.736
Your behavior conforms
with this hypnotic construct.

350
00:22:38.736 --> 00:22:41.360
so everything
that you see and do

351
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.947
feels perfectly normal.

352
00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:47.124
How is it that you know
so much about these hypnotics?

353
00:22:48.884 --> 00:22:50.852
Because I am one.

354
00:22:50.852 --> 00:22:51.784
Bullshit.

355
00:22:53.682 --> 00:22:54.718
A cynic.

356
00:22:54.718 --> 00:22:56.754
Mind control?

357
00:22:56.754 --> 00:22:59.239
Dream bank accounts?

358
00:22:59.239 --> 00:23:00.309
Sounds more like my ex-wife.

359
00:23:00.309 --> 00:23:02.208
Take it easy. Nicks.

360
00:23:02.208 --> 00:23:04.624
We just watched two cops
blow each other's brains out.

361
00:23:04.624 --> 00:23:05.936
and she's saying
it's some Vegas act.

362
00:23:07.316 --> 00:23:08.179
She's playing us.

363
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:11.735
Why don't you
have a seat. Nicks?

364
00:23:23.574 --> 00:23:24.748
You're a prisoner.

365
00:23:26.163 --> 00:23:27.475
Act like one.

366
00:23:34.136 --> 00:23:35.379
Nicks?

367
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.487
Oh. God.

368
00:23:41.661 --> 00:23:42.628
Hey. Nicks!

369
00:23:43.732 --> 00:23:44.802
Let's cut the shit out.

370
00:23:44.802 --> 00:23:45.872
Stop that.
whatever you're doing.

371
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.357
Why don't you get some air?

372
00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:53.846
Hey. you know what?

373
00:23:53.846 --> 00:23:55.641
I could use some air.

374
00:24:00.024 --> 00:24:01.129
I'll be outside.

375
00:24:04.097 --> 00:24:05.789
Don't worry. Detective.

376
00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:06.962
I already tried it on you.

377
00:24:08.516 --> 00:24:09.724
It didn't work.

378
00:24:11.035 --> 00:24:12.036
Who the hell are you?

379
00:24:13.969 --> 00:24:16.109
Just get me some coffee.

380
00:24:16.109 --> 00:24:17.456
Maybe I'll tell you.

381
00:24:31.677 --> 00:24:32.988
Need a light?

382
00:24:41.859 --> 00:24:43.412
They were looking for people

383
00:24:43.412 --> 00:24:46.277
who thought they had
above-normal intuitive ability.

384
00:24:48.521 --> 00:24:51.041
I usually make some money
reading tarot.

385
00:24:51.041 --> 00:24:53.250
They were offering 50 bucks.

386
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.252
I thought. "What the hell?"
and took the test.

387
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.083
A week later.

388
00:24:59.083 --> 00:25:01.638
there were two suits
waiting in my dorm room.

389
00:25:01.638 --> 00:25:02.604
Feds?

390
00:25:04.364 --> 00:25:06.194
They said
I could finish my degree.

391
00:25:06.194 --> 00:25:07.989
rack up more student debt.

392
00:25:07.989 --> 00:25:09.093
or I could come with them

393
00:25:09.093 --> 00:25:10.819
and earn six figures
in six months.

394
00:25:10.819 --> 00:25:12.683
That's not a government salary.

395
00:25:12.683 --> 00:25:14.236
The Division started

396
00:25:14.236 --> 00:25:16.929
as a privately-run
U.S. government program.

397
00:25:16.929 --> 00:25:19.725
developing methods
to influence political outcomes.

398
00:25:19.725 --> 00:25:20.691
Defense contractor.

399
00:25:20.691 --> 00:25:22.451
Defense. offense.

400
00:25:22.451 --> 00:25:24.039
whatever needed doing.

401
00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:25.282
The Division advanced

402
00:25:25.282 --> 00:25:27.249
American interests
around the world.

403
00:25:27.249 --> 00:25:29.286
but then they discovered

404
00:25:29.286 --> 00:25:30.805
the hypnotic ability
within humans...

405
00:25:32.254 --> 00:25:34.567
...and that this ability
could be trained.

406
00:25:34.567 --> 00:25:36.465
Improved upon.

407
00:25:36.465 --> 00:25:39.883
Hypnotics had a way
to get it done without receipts.

408
00:25:39.883 --> 00:25:40.815
What about Dellrayne?

409
00:25:41.885 --> 00:25:43.472
He was the legend.

410
00:25:43.472 --> 00:25:45.716
The most powerful hypnotic
ever trained.

411
00:25:45.716 --> 00:25:47.718
All of us were amateurs
compared to him.

412
00:25:48.926 --> 00:25:50.238
But then he went rogue.

413
00:25:50.238 --> 00:25:51.722
Dellrayne believed

414
00:25:51.722 --> 00:25:54.483
that only he could realize
the hypnotic's true potential.

415
00:25:54.483 --> 00:25:56.451
and tried to take over
the Division.

416
00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:00.179
I was one of the agents
who stood in his way.

417
00:26:01.698 --> 00:26:03.044
Division locked him up.

418
00:26:03.044 --> 00:26:05.046
I knew it wouldn't last.

419
00:26:05.046 --> 00:26:06.565
So I made it out.

420
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:07.566
Cut ties.

421
00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:09.257
Started fresh.

422
00:26:09.257 --> 00:26:10.327
Last week.

423
00:26:10.327 --> 00:26:12.398
when I read about the robberies.

424
00:26:12.398 --> 00:26:14.434
the other banks.

425
00:26:14.434 --> 00:26:16.713
and that no one
even remembered him.

426
00:26:16.713 --> 00:26:18.784
I knew that it was Dellrayne...

427
00:26:20.061 --> 00:26:21.131
...and I also knew

428
00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:23.512
that no one
who knows that he exists

429
00:26:23.512 --> 00:26:25.238
is safe.

430
00:26:25.238 --> 00:26:26.515
Especially you.

431
00:26:28.897 --> 00:26:30.623
He can't be caught.

432
00:26:35.455 --> 00:26:36.560
Stay here.

433
00:26:49.262 --> 00:26:50.332
Nicks?

434
00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:53.542
Nicks. it's me.

435
00:27:00.826 --> 00:27:01.999
Nicks?

436
00:27:03.276 --> 00:27:04.415
Put the gun down. Nicks.

437
00:27:06.141 --> 00:27:07.004
It's not him anymore.

438
00:27:08.557 --> 00:27:09.317
Do something.
Wake him up.

439
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.320
Dellrayne is doing this.
I'm not strong enough.

440
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.252
Nicks. put it down.

441
00:27:14.805 --> 00:27:16.255
Nicks. stop where you are!

442
00:27:19.465 --> 00:27:20.224
Nicks. stop or I'll shoot!

443
00:27:20.224 --> 00:27:21.640
Do it!

444
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.779
Rourke!

445
00:27:28.543 --> 00:27:30.683
Okay. buddy.
Are you all right? It's me.

446
00:27:30.683 --> 00:27:31.995
You okay?
You all right?

447
00:27:31.995 --> 00:27:33.513
You're all right.

448
00:27:33.513 --> 00:27:34.618
I got you in the leg.
You're okay.

449
00:27:46.526 --> 00:27:47.838
He won't stop

450
00:27:47.838 --> 00:27:49.771
until he accomplishes
what he's been told to do.

451
00:28:01.403 --> 00:28:03.095
Rourke. we need to go.

452
00:28:05.822 --> 00:28:06.961
Nicks.

453
00:28:08.376 --> 00:28:10.274
Stop. Nicks.
Stop. Nicks.

454
00:28:10.274 --> 00:28:11.206
Hey! Wake up!

455
00:28:12.587 --> 00:28:14.554
He's too far gone.

456
00:28:14.554 --> 00:28:16.384
Nicks.

457
00:28:16.384 --> 00:28:17.385
He'll kill us both.

458
00:28:17.385 --> 00:28:18.904
Nicks. this isn't you.

459
00:28:21.009 --> 00:28:22.045
Nicks!

460
00:28:23.563 --> 00:28:24.772
- He'll pull his hand off!
- Nicks!

461
00:28:25.945 --> 00:28:26.981
Rourke!

462
00:28:28.465 --> 00:28:29.569
Nicks!

463
00:28:45.068 --> 00:28:46.379
Put the gun down.

464
00:28:46.379 --> 00:28:47.898
Put it down!

465
00:28:50.659 --> 00:28:52.144
You killed him.

466
00:28:52.144 --> 00:28:53.524
He was already dead.

467
00:28:55.561 --> 00:28:56.735
He was already dead.

468
00:28:58.046 --> 00:28:59.082
I set him free.

469
00:29:09.402 --> 00:29:11.232
Nicks?

470
00:29:11.232 --> 00:29:12.371
Nicks...

471
00:29:37.534 --> 00:29:38.707
<i>A veteran police detective.</i>

472
00:29:38.707 --> 00:29:39.916
<i>Daniel Rourke.</i>

473
00:29:39.916 --> 00:29:41.952
<i>is wanted with another suspect
seen here.</i>

474
00:29:41.952 --> 00:29:43.022
<i>in connection</i>

475
00:29:43.022 --> 00:29:44.817
<i>with the execution-style slaying</i>

476
00:29:44.817 --> 00:29:47.820
<i>of his former partner.
Randy Nicks.</i>

477
00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.926
<i>Police detective Daniel Rourke's
missing daughter...</i>

478
00:29:49.926 --> 00:29:52.204
He had a wife.
Two kids.

479
00:29:52.204 --> 00:29:54.482
We had no choice.

480
00:29:54.482 --> 00:29:56.346
They think I killed him.

481
00:29:56.346 --> 00:29:58.141
That's exactly
what Dellrayne wants.

482
00:29:58.141 --> 00:29:59.798
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

483
00:30:01.454 --> 00:30:02.870
I know he took my daughter.

484
00:30:05.217 --> 00:30:06.356
What do you mean?

485
00:30:13.501 --> 00:30:15.296
This was. uh...

486
00:30:15.296 --> 00:30:18.299
in the safe-deposit box
at the bank.

487
00:30:18.299 --> 00:30:19.748
It's what Dellrayne came for.

488
00:30:24.719 --> 00:30:26.065
You don't understand
what it's like.

489
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:31.553
They never found her body.

490
00:30:39.907 --> 00:30:42.047
The guy they arrested...

491
00:30:42.047 --> 00:30:43.945
swears he doesn't even remember
the kidnapping.

492
00:30:45.429 --> 00:30:46.637
I always thought he was lying.

493
00:30:50.572 --> 00:30:51.919
What if he was
telling the truth?

494
00:30:54.507 --> 00:30:56.302
What if my daughter's
still out there?

495
00:31:04.793 --> 00:31:05.794
Morning. Luz.

496
00:31:05.794 --> 00:31:07.003
Morning.

497
00:31:07.003 --> 00:31:09.522
Just give me a couple of them
breakfast tacos.

498
00:31:09.522 --> 00:31:11.524
extra chorizo.

499
00:31:11.524 --> 00:31:12.525
Coffee?

500
00:31:12.525 --> 00:31:13.802
Black and sludgy.

501
00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.100
Call it in.

502
00:31:41.485 --> 00:31:42.762
You just saw us heading north.

503
00:31:46.042 --> 00:31:47.802
Dispatch.

504
00:31:47.802 --> 00:31:50.943
This is Tex DPS calling
to report two fugitives.

505
00:31:50.943 --> 00:31:52.496
Male and female

506
00:31:52.496 --> 00:31:55.948
heading north on I35
from Stonewall Trail.

507
00:31:55.948 --> 00:31:57.916
He'll get the check.

508
00:32:00.504 --> 00:32:01.712
Be generous.

509
00:32:02.748 --> 00:32:03.783
Luz?

510
00:32:05.578 --> 00:32:08.719
It's about time that I finally
gave you a decent tip.

511
00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.308
<i>This is dispatch.</i>

512
00:32:12.689 --> 00:32:15.312
<i>Two officers are arriving
at your location now.</i>

513
00:32:17.521 --> 00:32:18.867
<i>I found you. Diana.</i>

514
00:32:29.119 --> 00:32:30.051
Find us a way out of here.

515
00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:32.329
I have what he wants.

516
00:32:32.329 --> 00:32:33.710
- No.
- I'll distract him.

517
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.608
Rourke! No!
He'll kill you!

518
00:32:35.608 --> 00:32:36.713
Rourke!

519
00:32:39.026 --> 00:32:39.992
Shit!

520
00:34:15.777 --> 00:34:16.744
Ready to go?

521
00:34:19.781 --> 00:34:20.851
Get out.

522
00:34:31.931 --> 00:34:33.036
- That's a way out.
- Yeah.

523
00:34:40.595 --> 00:34:41.838
A construct makes you see

524
00:34:41.838 --> 00:34:43.495
what the hypnotic
wants you to see.

525
00:34:44.737 --> 00:34:46.498
It can look like anything.

526
00:34:46.498 --> 00:34:49.673
It's whatever makes you do
the behavior they want.

527
00:34:51.123 --> 00:34:52.918
But you're different.

528
00:34:52.918 --> 00:34:54.126
Why?

529
00:34:54.126 --> 00:34:55.162
You have a block. Detective.

530
00:34:55.162 --> 00:34:56.611
A psychic block.

531
00:34:57.785 --> 00:34:59.269
A hypnotic's worst nightmare.

532
00:34:59.269 --> 00:35:03.411
Everyone's subconscious mind
puts up a barrier to entry.

533
00:35:03.411 --> 00:35:04.619
For most people.

534
00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:06.345
it's a padlock.

535
00:35:06.345 --> 00:35:08.658
or a simple
one. two. three code.

536
00:35:09.866 --> 00:35:11.419
Yours...

537
00:35:11.419 --> 00:35:14.664
is locked inside a vault.
buried in a bunker 10 feet deep.

538
00:35:15.837 --> 00:35:17.460
I guess I'm lucky
I'm such a head case.

539
00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.807
Your block
could come from anywhere.

540
00:35:19.807 --> 00:35:21.464
Scar tissue.

541
00:35:21.464 --> 00:35:22.810
Emotional trauma.

542
00:35:24.052 --> 00:35:25.364
Your daughter maybe.

543
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.128
Pain can keep the mind awake.

544
00:35:31.957 --> 00:35:33.648
But the bottom line is.

545
00:35:33.648 --> 00:35:35.305
I can't get to you...

546
00:35:35.305 --> 00:35:36.824
but Dellrayne can.

547
00:36:02.056 --> 00:36:03.575
Excuse me. Officer.

548
00:36:05.197 --> 00:36:06.440
Which way is Mexico?

549
00:36:15.725 --> 00:36:17.589
Bet you've never gotten
a speeding ticket either.

550
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:18.555
Nope.

551
00:36:31.085 --> 00:36:33.225
Jeremiah was my handler
in the Division.

552
00:36:33.225 --> 00:36:35.054
Southwest Station Chief.

553
00:36:35.054 --> 00:36:36.504
Strong hypnotic?

554
00:36:36.504 --> 00:36:38.230
He's not one. actually.

555
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.749
Just a mean old bastard

556
00:36:39.749 --> 00:36:41.060
with a psychic block

557
00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.131
that makes yours...

558
00:36:43.131 --> 00:36:44.719
look like
a childproof safety cap.

559
00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:46.963
So you can't influence him?

560
00:36:46.963 --> 00:36:49.379
Not for long
before he spots the gap.

561
00:36:49.379 --> 00:36:50.484
Only Dellrayne ever could.

562
00:36:52.071 --> 00:36:53.935
This guy can help us catch him.

563
00:36:55.523 --> 00:36:57.422
Is your gun loaded?

564
00:36:57.422 --> 00:36:58.388
I thought this guy liked you.

565
00:36:59.527 --> 00:37:00.977
He loved me like a daughter.

566
00:37:00.977 --> 00:37:03.117
but I didn't split
with the Division

567
00:37:03.117 --> 00:37:04.222
on the best of terms.

568
00:37:05.292 --> 00:37:06.603
I left him hogtied
in a bathtub.

569
00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.296
Got it.

570
00:37:24.172 --> 00:37:25.553
Maria. la puerta!

571
00:37:29.108 --> 00:37:30.386
-¿Quién es?

572
00:37:30.386 --> 00:37:31.490
Stop. stop. stop.

573
00:37:32.836 --> 00:37:33.803
Get back.

574
00:37:38.635 --> 00:37:39.809
It's open.

575
00:37:41.742 --> 00:37:42.639
Hands up. jackass.

576
00:37:50.302 --> 00:37:51.786
¿Ahora quién es el pendejo?

577
00:37:54.582 --> 00:37:56.135
You sneaky bitch.

578
00:37:58.414 --> 00:37:59.622
You taught me well.

579
00:38:00.692 --> 00:38:02.797
Yes. I did.

580
00:38:02.797 --> 00:38:05.110
Well. looks like you've got
a student of your own now.

581
00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:06.525
Where-- Where is Maria?

582
00:38:06.525 --> 00:38:08.389
On a beach somewhere.
making a sandcastle.

583
00:38:11.703 --> 00:38:12.738
Hmm. Lucky her.

584
00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:15.362
There's tamales in the fridge.

585
00:38:15.362 --> 00:38:16.708
Help yourself.

586
00:38:16.708 --> 00:38:17.812
You know why we're here.

587
00:38:17.812 --> 00:38:21.126
It's not just
a friendly visit. then?

588
00:38:21.126 --> 00:38:22.990
I'm assuming that you know
that Dellrayne is out.

589
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.509
I may have heard.

590
00:38:24.509 --> 00:38:26.131
What does he want?
What's he after?

591
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:27.201
Are you serious?

592
00:38:27.201 --> 00:38:28.513
Does it look like I'm kidding?

593
00:38:29.652 --> 00:38:31.170
- Domino.
- What's Domino?

594
00:38:32.344 --> 00:38:34.139
- A myth.
- Yeah. See. that's the thing.

595
00:38:34.139 --> 00:38:35.451
You kind of left too soon.

596
00:38:35.451 --> 00:38:37.384
- You said it was destroyed.
- Want to fill me in here?

597
00:38:37.384 --> 00:38:42.009
Project Domino.
Division's Holy Grail.

598
00:38:42.009 --> 00:38:44.080
It was a tool made in our lab--

599
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.392
one that could control

600
00:38:45.392 --> 00:38:47.704
even the most powerful hypnotics.

601
00:38:47.704 --> 00:38:48.671
- Even Dellrayne?
- Yeah.

602
00:38:48.671 --> 00:38:49.810
Yeah. Yeah.

603
00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.087
Especially Dellrayne.

604
00:38:51.087 --> 00:38:52.985
That's why he stole it from us.

605
00:38:52.985 --> 00:38:55.816
Then he reset his own mind
to hide the trail.

606
00:38:55.816 --> 00:38:56.817
When we finally caught him.

607
00:38:56.817 --> 00:38:58.405
he had no memory of who he was.

608
00:38:58.405 --> 00:38:59.992
what he'd done with Domino. nothing.

609
00:38:59.992 --> 00:39:02.063
He erased his own mind?

610
00:39:02.063 --> 00:39:04.065
About six weeks ago.
it started to flood back.

611
00:39:05.239 --> 00:39:06.827
He broke out of our facility.

612
00:39:06.827 --> 00:39:10.934
He kind of. you know.
did the--fooled the guards.

613
00:39:10.934 --> 00:39:12.419
He must have planted triggers.

614
00:39:13.558 --> 00:39:16.077
It's clues the hypnotics
leave behind.

615
00:39:16.077 --> 00:39:18.286
like signposts
for their own subconscious.

616
00:39:18.286 --> 00:39:21.393
It can be words.
images. details.

617
00:39:21.393 --> 00:39:24.845
Puzzle pieces
that they use and scatter.

618
00:39:24.845 --> 00:39:26.191
in case their minds get reset.

619
00:39:26.191 --> 00:39:27.434
You know.
put the jigsaw back together.

620
00:39:27.434 --> 00:39:28.504
Remember who they are.

621
00:39:28.504 --> 00:39:30.126
The safe-deposit boxes.

622
00:39:30.126 --> 00:39:31.438
He's following the breadcrumbs.

623
00:39:31.438 --> 00:39:32.784
Yes.

624
00:39:32.784 --> 00:39:34.441
He must have planted
a whole stream

625
00:39:34.441 --> 00:39:35.442
before we caught him.

626
00:39:35.442 --> 00:39:36.926
The first few?

627
00:39:36.926 --> 00:39:39.515
That just restored
a portion of his power.

628
00:39:39.515 --> 00:39:42.414
Each one.
he's going to get stronger.

629
00:39:42.414 --> 00:39:43.415
He gets the last one.

630
00:39:43.415 --> 00:39:44.830
there's no stopping him.

631
00:39:46.522 --> 00:39:47.592
Where did you get that?

632
00:39:47.592 --> 00:39:49.041
The bank in Austin.

633
00:39:49.041 --> 00:39:51.078
It was in the safe-deposit box
he was after.

634
00:39:51.078 --> 00:39:52.528
It's a picture of my daughter.

635
00:39:52.528 --> 00:39:55.945
Well. she may play
a role in all this.

636
00:39:55.945 --> 00:39:56.911
It could be another trigger.

637
00:39:56.911 --> 00:39:58.016
Here. Let me see.

638
00:40:06.956 --> 00:40:08.129
What did you do to him?

639
00:40:10.338 --> 00:40:11.305
Who? This guy?

640
00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:16.517
Why are you backing up?

641
00:40:25.457 --> 00:40:26.424
Run.

642
00:40:47.617 --> 00:40:48.860
Get back!

643
00:41:30.557 --> 00:41:31.627
We're trapped!

644
00:41:31.627 --> 00:41:33.663
What you see isn't real.

645
00:42:26.198 --> 00:42:27.579
If you got any powers
you're holding out on.

646
00:42:27.579 --> 00:42:28.511
now's the time.

647
00:42:31.376 --> 00:42:32.342
All out.

648
00:42:40.212 --> 00:42:41.144
Rourke?

649
00:42:45.148 --> 00:42:46.529
Rourke?

650
00:42:58.645 --> 00:42:59.577
I'm not doing this.

651
00:43:03.822 --> 00:43:05.168
No.

652
00:43:05.168 --> 00:43:06.480
I am.

653
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.365
It just doesn't make sense.

654
00:43:29.365 --> 00:43:30.918
I mean. what?

655
00:43:30.918 --> 00:43:32.920
Do I have powers
all of a sudden?

656
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.681
I mean. how did I do that?

657
00:43:34.681 --> 00:43:36.544
I don't know.

658
00:43:36.544 --> 00:43:37.615
You saw it.

659
00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:39.306
You were right there.

660
00:43:39.306 --> 00:43:41.032
You know. one second.
he was coming right at me.

661
00:43:41.032 --> 00:43:42.309
The next minute.

662
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:44.518
it was literally as if
I was inside their minds.

663
00:43:44.518 --> 00:43:45.864
Welcome to the club.

664
00:43:45.864 --> 00:43:47.797
That's not possible.

665
00:43:47.797 --> 00:43:49.281
I've never done anything
like this before.

666
00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:50.351
I wouldn't know how.

667
00:43:50.351 --> 00:43:51.905
Or you just can't remember.

668
00:43:53.492 --> 00:43:54.804
- I--
- What you just did?

669
00:43:54.804 --> 00:43:56.185
Power like this.

670
00:43:56.185 --> 00:43:58.532
it takes more
than natural ability. okay?

671
00:43:58.532 --> 00:44:00.568
And I have no idea
how you did it.

672
00:44:02.674 --> 00:44:04.124
All right.
I have to know everything.

673
00:44:04.124 --> 00:44:06.229
Why me?

674
00:44:06.229 --> 00:44:07.990
Why my daughter?

675
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:10.026
Dellrayne. Domino. this.

676
00:44:12.822 --> 00:44:14.237
Will you help me. please?

677
00:44:19.795 --> 00:44:20.934
Yes.

678
00:44:26.318 --> 00:44:29.080
River is the guy
who built their network.

679
00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.391
If there's anyone

680
00:44:30.391 --> 00:44:33.325
who can hack into
their database.

681
00:44:33.325 --> 00:44:34.879
it's him.

682
00:44:34.879 --> 00:44:36.950
He helped me disappear
when I left Division.

683
00:44:39.262 --> 00:44:41.230
But fair warning...

684
00:44:42.818 --> 00:44:44.854
...he can be eccentric.

685
00:44:44.854 --> 00:44:47.477
Oh!
And you're the normal one.

686
00:44:49.997 --> 00:44:51.274
He's a friend.

687
00:44:51.274 --> 00:44:52.344
Uh-huh. yeah.

688
00:44:52.344 --> 00:44:54.105
Good illusions anyways.

689
00:44:54.105 --> 00:44:55.347
No illusion.

690
00:44:55.347 --> 00:44:57.039
We're real.

691
00:44:57.039 --> 00:44:58.247
We need your help.

692
00:45:00.525 --> 00:45:01.526
With Dellrayne.

693
00:45:01.526 --> 00:45:03.252
I-I can't help you.

694
00:45:03.252 --> 00:45:05.219
If he knows we're here.

695
00:45:05.219 --> 00:45:07.256
he'll torture
and reset you anyway.

696
00:45:19.578 --> 00:45:20.718
You're cold. Cruz.

697
00:45:21.926 --> 00:45:23.168
At least offer us a drink.

698
00:45:25.032 --> 00:45:26.240
I was going to.

699
00:45:27.276 --> 00:45:28.622
Anyways.

700
00:45:32.212 --> 00:45:33.731
I think.

701
00:45:42.429 --> 00:45:43.671
What happened to your eye?

702
00:45:43.671 --> 00:45:47.745
Asymmetrical shapes
help fool facial recognition.

703
00:45:50.333 --> 00:45:53.129
Camera drones and satellites
everywhere these days.

704
00:45:53.129 --> 00:45:54.682
Not to mention the Division.

705
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:59.687
Are you inside
my mind right now?

706
00:45:59.687 --> 00:46:00.930
No.

707
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:03.830
We're both friends.

708
00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:05.659
Amigos.

709
00:46:05.659 --> 00:46:06.936
Okay.

710
00:46:08.317 --> 00:46:11.458
Listen. uh. don't--
don't judge.

711
00:46:11.458 --> 00:46:13.218
I wasn't expecting visitors.

712
00:46:16.808 --> 00:46:18.120
This way.

713
00:46:30.373 --> 00:46:31.789
Watch your step.

714
00:46:34.446 --> 00:46:35.931
You know.
you could have called. Diana.

715
00:46:35.931 --> 00:46:37.725
Sent a text.

716
00:46:37.725 --> 00:46:39.486
you know. one of those
little Morse code thingies.

717
00:46:39.486 --> 00:46:40.590
I do have radio. you know.

718
00:46:42.282 --> 00:46:43.559
Showing up unannounced
is just rude.

719
00:46:43.559 --> 00:46:44.836
Ah.

720
00:46:44.836 --> 00:46:47.080
Homemade Mountain Dew.

721
00:46:48.184 --> 00:46:49.185
My own brew.

722
00:46:49.185 --> 00:46:50.221
All organic.

723
00:46:50.221 --> 00:46:51.981
Uh. no thanks.

724
00:46:51.981 --> 00:46:52.982
All right. Huh?

725
00:46:54.535 --> 00:46:55.433
All right. fine.
More for me.

726
00:46:59.161 --> 00:47:01.301
Mm. Check it out.

727
00:47:01.301 --> 00:47:02.198
Pretty impressive. huh?

728
00:47:04.649 --> 00:47:05.857
Hypnotics did all this?

729
00:47:05.857 --> 00:47:06.824
Uh-huh.

730
00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:08.204
It's a worldwide play. brother.

731
00:47:08.204 --> 00:47:10.862
Controlling major news.
events. organizations.

732
00:47:10.862 --> 00:47:12.553
Why the hell
are you here. Diana?

733
00:47:13.692 --> 00:47:15.902
Dellrayne is back.

734
00:47:15.902 --> 00:47:18.594
It has something to do
with Rourke's missing daughter.

735
00:47:18.594 --> 00:47:20.423
Dellrayne sent an army for us.

736
00:47:21.493 --> 00:47:23.564
Rourke. he took control.

737
00:47:25.773 --> 00:47:26.947
He overpowered him.

738
00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:35.922
Huh.

739
00:47:35.922 --> 00:47:37.716
More than meets the eye. huh?

740
00:47:39.028 --> 00:47:40.547
Apparently.

741
00:47:40.547 --> 00:47:41.479
But to what degree?

742
00:47:43.343 --> 00:47:44.275
Let's find out.

743
00:47:47.761 --> 00:47:49.176
All right. now listen.
I've got to tell you.

744
00:47:49.176 --> 00:47:51.454
hacking into a database this big
ain't easy-breezy. all right?

745
00:48:01.602 --> 00:48:05.123
All right. Austin PD database
has you employed 12 years.

746
00:48:05.123 --> 00:48:06.055
That's right.

747
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:09.576
All right. I got a hit
for the Marine Corps.

748
00:48:09.576 --> 00:48:12.406
Distinguished Service medal.
honorable discharge.

749
00:48:12.406 --> 00:48:13.649
Said you had a family.

750
00:48:14.961 --> 00:48:16.100
Uh. let's see.

751
00:48:17.446 --> 00:48:19.448
Archives show no record
of a Daniel Rourke's spouse.

752
00:48:20.932 --> 00:48:22.071
Can't be.

753
00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:23.831
What was your wife's
maiden name?

754
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:25.972
Riley. Vivian Riley.

755
00:48:25.972 --> 00:48:26.765
Vivian Riley.

756
00:48:30.666 --> 00:48:31.632
That's her.

757
00:48:33.048 --> 00:48:34.014
Whoa.

758
00:48:36.085 --> 00:48:38.260
"Vivian Riley...

759
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.192
Division agent."

760
00:48:45.923 --> 00:48:48.063
That's impossible.

761
00:48:48.063 --> 00:48:49.029
"Current location encrypted."

762
00:48:50.513 --> 00:48:51.445
Can you hack it?

763
00:48:54.621 --> 00:48:56.312
I'll run something.

764
00:48:56.312 --> 00:48:57.451
It'll take a few hours.

765
00:48:57.451 --> 00:48:58.901
That's not right.

766
00:49:00.523 --> 00:49:02.180
We were together since college.

767
00:49:03.975 --> 00:49:07.530
I came home. had Minnie.
a family.

768
00:49:08.635 --> 00:49:09.877
This is my life.

769
00:49:10.982 --> 00:49:11.914
I'm sorry.

770
00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:31.313
You look like you need a drink.

771
00:49:33.522 --> 00:49:34.799
Moonshine.

772
00:49:34.799 --> 00:49:36.283
Thanks.

773
00:49:36.283 --> 00:49:37.698
Burns a little.

774
00:49:37.698 --> 00:49:42.013
but at least
it will help you forget.

775
00:49:49.572 --> 00:49:50.573
When we lost Minnie...

776
00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:53.024
...we lost everything.

777
00:49:55.302 --> 00:49:56.303
We lost ourselves.

778
00:49:56.303 --> 00:49:57.580
<i>The body</i>

779
00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.134
<i>of police Detective
Daniel Rourke's</i>

780
00:49:59.134 --> 00:50:00.411
<i>missing daughter.
Minnie Rourke.</i>

781
00:50:00.411 --> 00:50:01.515
<i>has still not been recovered.</i>

782
00:50:01.515 --> 00:50:03.517
And I can't keep going!

783
00:50:04.725 --> 00:50:05.761
<i>Nothing we had survived.</i>

784
00:50:05.761 --> 00:50:07.245
I can't.

785
00:50:10.041 --> 00:50:11.249
<i>Maybe Viv lied
about who she was.</i>

786
00:50:14.252 --> 00:50:16.703
But the pain was real.

787
00:50:20.431 --> 00:50:22.605
Sometimes.
it's all I had to hold on to.

788
00:51:08.617 --> 00:51:11.102
Whatever you're selling.
I'm not interested.

789
00:51:11.102 --> 00:51:12.345
<i>You're never
going to find your daughter.</i>

790
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.761
How about I kill you?

791
00:51:21.423 --> 00:51:22.424
<i>You think you're strong?</i>

792
00:51:22.424 --> 00:51:23.701
<i>More powerful than me?</i>

793
00:51:24.978 --> 00:51:26.083
<i>I have other ways
of getting to you.</i>

794
00:51:27.498 --> 00:51:29.327
<i>Diana betrayed me.</i>

795
00:51:29.327 --> 00:51:32.468
<i>and now you're going
to kill her.</i>

796
00:51:32.468 --> 00:51:33.883
<i>Put that gun in your hand.</i>

797
00:51:42.271 --> 00:51:43.514
<i>Put three bullets in her head.</i>

798
00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:46.896
No.

799
00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.321
Diana.

800
00:52:02.153 --> 00:52:03.396
- Just a minute.
- Diana.

801
00:52:11.714 --> 00:52:12.750
Di--

802
00:52:15.166 --> 00:52:16.167
I'm coming.

803
00:52:23.726 --> 00:52:24.934
I had to borrow
one of River's shirts.

804
00:52:28.973 --> 00:52:29.905
What happened?

805
00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.222
He got to you. didn't he?

806
00:52:43.988 --> 00:52:45.058
I can see it.

807
00:52:46.197 --> 00:52:47.440
I heard a phone ring.
Did you answer it?

808
00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:50.201
Yes.

809
00:52:50.201 --> 00:52:51.375
Did he speak?

810
00:52:52.514 --> 00:52:53.584
What did he tell you?

811
00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.449
I... I don't...

812
00:53:03.387 --> 00:53:04.733
What is it that you see?

813
00:53:07.011 --> 00:53:07.874
I don't know.

814
00:53:17.918 --> 00:53:18.816
Where's your phone?

815
00:53:44.704 --> 00:53:46.084
I know things feel off.

816
00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:02.446
I know she hurt you.

817
00:54:06.726 --> 00:54:07.761
Do we have trust?

818
00:57:28.962 --> 00:57:31.206
Project Domino was never a what.

819
00:57:31.206 --> 00:57:32.656
No.

820
00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:35.244
It was a who.

821
00:57:38.213 --> 00:57:40.284
Where is she?

822
00:57:40.284 --> 00:57:42.769
Is she even alive?
Where did you take her?

823
00:57:42.769 --> 00:57:43.667
I didn't take her.

824
00:57:45.496 --> 00:57:46.911
You did.

825
00:57:51.019 --> 00:57:52.503
She's going
to have opportunities.

826
00:57:52.503 --> 00:57:53.642
On the one hand.

827
00:57:53.642 --> 00:57:55.610
you think.
well. I really am the person

828
00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:57.128
that should make
these decisions.

829
00:57:57.128 --> 00:57:59.130
but on the other hand.
you're better off away from her.

830
00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:00.166
I'm her mother.

831
00:58:00.166 --> 00:58:01.029
Yeah. well. I'm her father.

832
00:58:02.548 --> 00:58:04.273
They wanted to take her.

833
00:58:05.516 --> 00:58:06.966
The Division only wanted
to train her

834
00:58:06.966 --> 00:58:08.726
like they trained us--

835
00:58:08.726 --> 00:58:10.694
to be what she was born to be--

836
00:58:10.694 --> 00:58:13.006
the most powerful hypnotic
in the world.

837
00:58:14.076 --> 00:58:15.388
She was just a child.

838
00:58:32.819 --> 00:58:33.786
Minnie?

839
00:58:37.997 --> 00:58:39.654
You kidnapped our daughter.

840
00:58:39.654 --> 00:58:42.898
I protected her from you.

841
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.421
I protected her from all of you.

842
00:58:51.528 --> 00:58:52.425
Where are we now?

843
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:55.393
Are we really even here?

844
00:58:57.534 --> 00:58:58.500
Can't you see it yet?

845
00:59:04.402 --> 00:59:05.438
Look closer.

846
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:42.095
You're in on this. too. Nicks?

847
00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:44.926
Or whatever your name is?

848
00:59:46.755 --> 00:59:48.032
You brought this on yourself.

849
00:59:49.965 --> 00:59:51.622
By the time we found you.
Domino was gone...

850
00:59:54.073 --> 00:59:56.178
...and you reset yourself.

851
00:59:56.178 --> 00:59:58.180
Wiped clean.

852
00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.182
No memory
of where you hid her...

853
01:00:00.182 --> 01:00:01.218
for four years.

854
01:00:02.426 --> 01:00:03.427
You've been an obstacle to me

855
01:00:03.427 --> 01:00:05.360
for too long. Rourke.

856
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.362
This was dropped off
at Division headquarters...

857
01:00:08.777 --> 01:00:10.365
...six weeks ago.

858
01:00:10.365 --> 01:00:11.642
A clue or a taunt.

859
01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:12.988
You know what it means.

860
01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:16.371
Buried underneath
that psychic block.

861
01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:20.617
That's why we developed
this construct.

862
01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.998
The cop searching for the man
who took his missing daughter.

863
01:00:22.998 --> 01:00:24.655
Using my own brain against me.

864
01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:26.968
To get you to remember
where you hid her.

865
01:00:28.279 --> 01:00:29.764
Like it or not.

866
01:00:29.764 --> 01:00:31.697
your daughter is going to reach
her full potential with me.

867
01:00:33.699 --> 01:00:35.390
Who is Lev Dellrayne?

868
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:12.763
This is where it always ends.

869
01:02:14.213 --> 01:02:16.456
We can't brute-force
a mind like yours. Dan.

870
01:02:18.286 --> 01:02:19.805
This was our 12th run
of the scenario.

871
01:02:21.116 --> 01:02:24.602
But every time we get too close.
you see the gaps.

872
01:02:24.602 --> 01:02:25.742
and the construct breaks.

873
01:02:28.952 --> 01:02:30.263
Just help us find her.

874
01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:36.753
You had 12 runs at this...

875
01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:37.995
and you haven't found her?

876
01:02:40.618 --> 01:02:43.380
Well. get ready for number 13.

877
01:02:46.176 --> 01:02:47.556
Because I'll never
tell you where she is.

878
01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:53.735
Take him in.

879
01:03:08.336 --> 01:03:09.647
Your mind
can't take much more...

880
01:03:13.306 --> 01:03:15.861
...of this...

881
01:03:15.861 --> 01:03:17.138
resets.

882
01:03:19.036 --> 01:03:20.210
At some point.

883
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:22.177
the synapses
start breaking down.

884
01:03:22.177 --> 01:03:26.112
and it's too late
to get back what you were.

885
01:03:26.112 --> 01:03:27.976
what we had.

886
01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.083
Was any of it real?

887
01:03:35.156 --> 01:03:36.364
I love you.

888
01:03:37.952 --> 01:03:39.781
Don't ask me why.

889
01:03:43.336 --> 01:03:44.406
You remember. don't you?

890
01:03:45.649 --> 01:03:47.099
The good times.

891
01:03:48.686 --> 01:03:49.998
We did have a few.

892
01:03:51.068 --> 01:03:52.380
I remember everything.

893
01:03:57.143 --> 01:03:58.835
I know we wanted
different things for her.

894
01:04:00.422 --> 01:04:03.529
I know you want her to be free
to make her own decisions.

895
01:04:07.084 --> 01:04:09.259
She's too powerful
to be out there alone.

896
01:04:10.674 --> 01:04:12.020
She needs her mom and dad.

897
01:04:13.573 --> 01:04:14.747
We can be with her again.

898
01:04:17.439 --> 01:04:18.716
Together. Danny.

899
01:04:20.718 --> 01:04:22.237
Just tell me where she is.

900
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:30.280
Go to hell.

901
01:04:54.235 --> 01:04:55.512
Initiate the reset.

902
01:05:22.746 --> 01:05:23.643
Where's your wife?

903
01:05:27.613 --> 01:05:28.648
I don't know.

904
01:05:29.822 --> 01:05:30.823
Where is your daughter?

905
01:05:32.998 --> 01:05:33.964
I don't know.

906
01:05:35.828 --> 01:05:37.002
Have you ever been in love?

907
01:05:39.694 --> 01:05:41.247
I don't know.

908
01:05:41.247 --> 01:05:42.939
Subject is clear.

909
01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.181
Prepare sequence.

910
01:05:44.181 --> 01:05:45.700
Okay.

911
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.116
One kidnapping
coming right up.

912
01:05:48.116 --> 01:05:50.463
All right. people.
let's go to reset.

913
01:05:50.463 --> 01:05:52.120
Places. everybody.

914
01:06:01.819 --> 01:06:03.511
Okay. here we go.

915
01:06:26.396 --> 01:06:27.362
Rourke?

916
01:06:32.816 --> 01:06:33.955
Rourke.

917
01:06:35.474 --> 01:06:36.716
Rourke?

918
01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.029
Come back to us.

919
01:06:44.586 --> 01:06:47.520
Sorry. Must have drifted off
for a second.

920
01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.521
It's okay.

921
01:06:48.521 --> 01:06:49.591
It's your time.

922
01:06:51.904 --> 01:06:52.767
Where was I?

923
01:06:52.767 --> 01:06:54.251
The park?

924
01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:57.496
Your daughter.

925
01:06:57.496 --> 01:06:59.394
Right.

926
01:06:59.394 --> 01:07:00.913
The park.

927
01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:03.640
Her hair.

928
01:07:05.883 --> 01:07:07.126
I remember her hair.

929
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.064
Heart rate is normal.

930
01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:15.617
He's deep in the construct now.

931
01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:54.208
<i>Alleged kidnapper
18-year old Lyle Terry</i>

932
01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:57.245
<i>has pled not guilty
due to mental incapacity.</i>

933
01:07:57.245 --> 01:08:00.386
<i>his lawyers insisting
he has no memory whatsoever...</i>

934
01:08:04.666 --> 01:08:06.082
He's noting where
his wedding band used to be.

935
01:08:07.842 --> 01:08:08.946
That's my cue.

936
01:08:25.756 --> 01:08:26.861
You lose something. compadre?

937
01:08:26.861 --> 01:08:27.827
Cockroach.

938
01:08:28.932 --> 01:08:30.140
Yeah. it's a hot day.

939
01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.107
The damn things are everywhere.

940
01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:35.801
Hey.

941
01:08:35.801 --> 01:08:37.630
Did you wipe your shoes?

942
01:08:41.703 --> 01:08:43.153
Call came into dispatch.

943
01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.327
Blocked number.

944
01:08:45.983 --> 01:08:47.709
<i>I'm calling to report a robbery.</i>

945
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:49.470
<i>Is this crime
currently in progress?</i>

946
01:08:50.816 --> 01:08:52.197
<i>Today. the Bank of Austin.</i>

947
01:08:52.197 --> 01:08:53.612
<i>There's a safe-deposit box.</i>

948
01:08:53.612 --> 01:08:55.303
<i>Box 23.</i>

949
01:09:01.654 --> 01:09:03.069
We're here.

950
01:09:17.325 --> 01:09:18.430
Welcome to the show. boys.

951
01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.028
See that guy on the bench?

952
01:09:34.031 --> 01:09:34.963
He looks familiar.

953
01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:39.036
Something wrong. bud?

954
01:09:43.903 --> 01:09:46.389
<i>It's a sunny day.</i>

955
01:09:46.389 --> 01:09:47.286
The guards are in on it.

956
01:09:48.874 --> 01:09:49.806
Rourke.
Rourke. wait!

957
01:09:57.607 --> 01:09:58.815
Get ready for the bank robbery.

958
01:10:25.635 --> 01:10:26.739
Where's Rourke?

959
01:10:29.363 --> 01:10:30.467
Where's Rourke?

960
01:10:30.467 --> 01:10:32.228
River?

961
01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.298
Where is he?

962
01:10:33.298 --> 01:10:34.230
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
I don't have eyes.

963
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.265
Stand by.

964
01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:36.715
Anybody got eyes on Rourke?

965
01:10:41.823 --> 01:10:43.584
All hands on deck.

966
01:10:43.584 --> 01:10:44.826
Subject has broken through.

967
01:11:02.672 --> 01:11:04.708
Stop.

968
01:11:06.779 --> 01:11:08.022
Turn off the engine.

969
01:11:09.334 --> 01:11:10.680
And step out.

970
01:11:12.992 --> 01:11:15.201
Rourke...

971
01:11:15.201 --> 01:11:16.720
turn off the engine.

972
01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:23.244
And step out.

973
01:11:46.371 --> 01:11:48.890
Get the helicopter.
Send everyone.

974
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:50.444
- Don't lose him.
- His notebook.

975
01:11:50.444 --> 01:11:52.031
He tore out a page.
but look what he wrote down.

976
01:11:52.031 --> 01:11:54.240
Deer Valley Lane.

977
01:11:56.346 --> 01:11:58.037
Lev Dellrayne is not a name.

978
01:11:58.037 --> 01:12:00.385
It's a trigger he left
to remember her location.

979
01:12:34.764 --> 01:12:35.696
Took you long enough.

980
01:12:39.389 --> 01:12:40.252
- You alone?
-  For now.

981
01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.219
They'll be here soon.

982
01:12:43.428 --> 01:12:44.705
Where is she?

983
01:12:50.262 --> 01:12:51.608
I've got something.

984
01:12:51.608 --> 01:12:53.299
It looks like Deer Valley Lane

985
01:12:53.299 --> 01:12:54.680
dead-ends into a cattle ranch

986
01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.751
belonging to
a Carl and Thelma Everett.

987
01:12:56.751 --> 01:12:57.752
What's their link to Rourke?

988
01:12:57.752 --> 01:12:59.685
There's nothing in the file.

989
01:12:59.685 --> 01:13:01.894
He must have hid Minnie
with them all this time.

990
01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.383
It says here they had
a foster kid 40 years ago.

991
01:13:11.939 --> 01:13:12.905
It's Rourke.

992
01:13:16.633 --> 01:13:18.566
Before this goes down.
I need to know something.

993
01:13:18.566 --> 01:13:20.326
Why did you trust us with her?

994
01:13:22.294 --> 01:13:24.434
You taught me
everything I know. Carl.

995
01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:25.642
including how to keep

996
01:13:25.642 --> 01:13:26.988
a moral compass pointed
in the right direction.

997
01:13:28.093 --> 01:13:30.095
Is this going to work?

998
01:13:30.095 --> 01:13:30.992
If you're ready.

999
01:13:36.653 --> 01:13:37.999
You'd best get inside.

1000
01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:00.703
Hi. Daddy.

1001
01:15:02.359 --> 01:15:03.257
I set them up for you.

1002
01:15:05.362 --> 01:15:06.432
I've missed you. baby.

1003
01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:24.692
She's here.

1004
01:16:11.221 --> 01:16:13.879
Read the signs. jackass.

1005
01:16:16.054 --> 01:16:19.713
Private goddamn property.

1006
01:16:19.713 --> 01:16:20.748
Hold your fire.

1007
01:16:23.233 --> 01:16:24.131
We missed you. sweetheart.

1008
01:16:29.343 --> 01:16:30.551
I don't know you.

1009
01:16:32.139 --> 01:16:33.865
We love you like our own. Diana.

1010
01:16:35.349 --> 01:16:36.626
But we'll still put
a hole in you.

1011
01:16:38.766 --> 01:16:40.941
You have my daughter

1012
01:16:40.941 --> 01:16:42.839
and we're not leaving here
without her.

1013
01:16:47.326 --> 01:16:48.845
Kill them.

1014
01:16:50.364 --> 01:16:51.399
Carl!

1015
01:16:54.264 --> 01:16:55.783
No! Get medical.

1016
01:16:55.783 --> 01:16:56.819
We need medical!

1017
01:16:57.958 --> 01:16:59.166
We're not here for them.

1018
01:16:59.166 --> 01:17:00.167
Where is she?

1019
01:17:01.375 --> 01:17:02.618
Where's Minnie?

1020
01:17:06.552 --> 01:17:09.141
Whatever Rourke has told you.
it's a lie.

1021
01:17:09.141 --> 01:17:11.488
She won't be safe until
she's back with us at Division.

1022
01:17:11.488 --> 01:17:12.697
That's where she belongs.

1023
01:17:14.319 --> 01:17:15.389
That's not you talking.

1024
01:17:17.356 --> 01:17:18.564
That's the Division.

1025
01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.810
The Diana I know.

1026
01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:25.123
the woman I love.

1027
01:17:25.123 --> 01:17:26.711
wouldn't want this life
for our little girl.

1028
01:17:28.471 --> 01:17:29.506
Think about that.

1029
01:17:29.506 --> 01:17:30.576
There's no escaping us.

1030
01:17:30.576 --> 01:17:31.923
You know that.

1031
01:17:33.545 --> 01:17:35.340
You know the consequences.

1032
01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:37.998
There's only two ways this ends.

1033
01:17:37.998 --> 01:17:40.725
You and Minnie
come back to Division.

1034
01:17:40.725 --> 01:17:43.451
or Minnie comes back
without you.

1035
01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:49.078
It's all right. sweetheart.
Come on out.

1036
01:18:11.756 --> 01:18:13.205
You're so big.

1037
01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:16.484
You're safe now.

1038
01:18:17.554 --> 01:18:18.659
You're safe.

1039
01:18:21.248 --> 01:18:23.699
You still wear braids.

1040
01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.010
I make them myself now.

1041
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:26.494
Of course you do.

1042
01:18:29.359 --> 01:18:30.464
I'm so proud of you. Mommy.

1043
01:18:34.123 --> 01:18:35.296
Proud of me for what?

1044
01:18:35.296 --> 01:18:36.573
For coming home.

1045
01:18:43.373 --> 01:18:44.478
We're setting ourselves free.

1046
01:18:46.756 --> 01:18:47.757
From them.

1047
01:18:51.554 --> 01:18:52.658
No.

1048
01:18:53.867 --> 01:18:54.799
When did she...

1049
01:19:03.255 --> 01:19:04.636
This isn't real.

1050
01:19:07.225 --> 01:19:08.605
We're not here!

1051
01:19:14.266 --> 01:19:15.509
It's a construct!

1052
01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:17.925
It's her!

1053
01:19:30.835 --> 01:19:32.008
Uh...

1054
01:19:41.949 --> 01:19:43.813
You're doing this.

1055
01:19:47.161 --> 01:19:48.335
I love you.

1056
01:19:49.543 --> 01:19:50.647
I love you. too.

1057
01:19:50.647 --> 01:19:52.477
I'm going to bring you back now.

1058
01:19:56.101 --> 01:19:57.171
Close your eyes.

1059
01:21:52.286 --> 01:21:53.253
Have you ever been in love?

1060
01:21:53.253 --> 01:21:54.254
Where am I?

1061
01:21:55.841 --> 01:21:56.912
Where am I?

1062
01:22:04.574 --> 01:22:06.162
Have you ever been in love?

1063
01:22:06.162 --> 01:22:07.129
Help!

1064
01:22:08.751 --> 01:22:09.855
Where am I?

1065
01:22:09.855 --> 01:22:10.995
Help!

1066
01:22:26.182 --> 01:22:27.701
Help!

1067
01:22:39.644 --> 01:22:40.921
Do you remember now. Mommy?

1068
01:22:44.614 --> 01:22:45.857
When she was born.

1069
01:22:45.857 --> 01:22:47.238
we prayed
she wouldn't be like us.

1070
01:22:48.687 --> 01:22:49.585
That she would be normal.

1071
01:22:51.794 --> 01:22:53.002
<i>But soon. we understood</i>

1072
01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:55.315
<i>that the daughter
of two powerful hypnotics</i>

1073
01:22:55.315 --> 01:22:56.661
<i>would have
an extraordinary gift.</i>

1074
01:22:58.697 --> 01:23:00.044
<i>It would help the world explore</i>

1075
01:23:00.044 --> 01:23:02.080
<i>the untapped abilities
of the human mind.</i>

1076
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.742
<i>The Division realized</i>

1077
01:23:08.742 --> 01:23:11.987
<i>that Minnie's power
could transform society--</i>

1078
01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:15.507
<i>not to unlock human potential.</i>

1079
01:23:15.507 --> 01:23:19.373
<i>but to force people
to do what they were told...</i>

1080
01:23:19.373 --> 01:23:20.719
<i>or else.</i>

1081
01:23:24.723 --> 01:23:26.104
<i>They wanted
Minnie to be their weapon.</i>

1082
01:23:29.935 --> 01:23:32.248
<i>We wanted our daughter
to be free.</i>

1083
01:23:32.248 --> 01:23:34.147
<i>but we knew we could never
outrun the Division.</i>

1084
01:23:34.147 --> 01:23:35.769
<i>They would never let us go.</i>

1085
01:23:35.769 --> 01:23:38.496
<i>The only way
to escape any of them</i>

1086
01:23:38.496 --> 01:23:40.877
<i>was to bring them all together.</i>

1087
01:23:40.877 --> 01:23:42.672
<i>and destroy the Division completely.</i>

1088
01:23:42.672 --> 01:23:44.088
Wake up. sweetie.

1089
01:23:44.088 --> 01:23:45.779
<i>But we couldn't
take them on ourselves.</i>

1090
01:23:50.577 --> 01:23:51.785
She wasn't ready yet.

1091
01:23:53.235 --> 01:23:54.236
<i>That's why we had to wait.</i>

1092
01:23:55.444 --> 01:23:56.962
<i>Three years.</i>

1093
01:23:56.962 --> 01:23:57.929
<i>maybe more.</i>

1094
01:23:59.379 --> 01:24:00.759
<i>Then she'd be strong enough.</i>

1095
01:24:02.382 --> 01:24:03.590
<i>That's when she'd send
the trigger.</i>

1096
01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.869
<i>Tip the first domino.</i>

1097
01:24:06.869 --> 01:24:08.560
<i>to lead them out here...</i>

1098
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.837
<i>and kill them.</i>

1099
01:24:11.425 --> 01:24:13.462
And we knew the only way

1100
01:24:13.462 --> 01:24:15.464
to keep our plan
from the Division

1101
01:24:15.464 --> 01:24:17.638
was to erase our own memories.

1102
01:24:17.638 --> 01:24:19.226
Help!

1103
01:24:19.226 --> 01:24:20.710
Where am I?

1104
01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:22.264
Help!

1105
01:24:24.542 --> 01:24:26.061
<i>We reset ourselves</i>

1106
01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:30.410
and believed
we loved each other so much.

1107
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:31.514
we would find each other again.

1108
01:24:34.655 --> 01:24:35.760
Minnie and I.

1109
01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.451
we're your most stubborn memories.

1110
01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:39.246
the hardest ones to erase.

1111
01:24:39.246 --> 01:24:40.523
I didn't want to let you go.

1112
01:24:42.732 --> 01:24:43.802
Now you never have to.

1113
01:24:47.737 --> 01:24:48.876
What now?

1114
01:24:51.569 --> 01:24:53.329
We finally get to decide that
for ourselves.

1115
01:24:57.437 --> 01:24:58.610
We're free.

1116
01:25:01.234 --> 01:25:02.856
We're finally free.

1117
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:35.949
Y'all go on ahead.

1118
01:26:35.949 --> 01:26:38.054
I'll clean up here
and follow you.
