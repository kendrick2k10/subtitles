3
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:25.706
Good morning.

4
00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:27.499
- Morning.
- Good morning.

5
00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:28.626
Good morning.

6
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.587
So. here I am. All ready for battle.

7
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.632
I'd better introduce you.

8
00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:37.051
This is Mr Peter Wakeling.
our new colleague.

9
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:39.345
Mr Wakeling. Mr Hart.

10
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.013
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

11
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.015
- And Mr Rusbridger.
- How do you do?

12
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.683
You're eagerly awaited. Mr Wakeling.

13
00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.477
We've been short now.
nearly two months.

14
00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:48.479
Well. I hope to make a difference.

15
00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.564
It may take a week or two though.

16
00:03:57.488 --> 00:03:58.614
Don't worry. old chap.

17
00:03:58.614 --> 00:04:01.408
This time of morning.
it's a kind of rule.

18
00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.119
Not too much fun and laughter.
Rather like church.

19
00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:06.246
Oh.

20
00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.541
Yes. I see what you mean.

21
00:04:54.712 --> 00:04:56.672
First day's always
a bit nerve-racking.

22
00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:00.592
- Yes.
- You'll get the hang of it.

23
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.386
As for these chaps here.

24
00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:04.013
they'll improve somewhat
once they wake up.

25
00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:08.058
It's not us you have to worry about.
Mr Wakeling. We're your pals.

26
00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.978
But you'll need to get
on the right side of the old man.

27
00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:12.980
You mean Mr Williams?

28
00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:16.191
He seemed a decent sort
at the interview.

29
00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:18.986
A little on the frosty side. perhaps.

30
00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.701
The truth is. I didn't really get
to see too much of him.

31
00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:28.579
Well. you're about
to get another chance just now.

32
00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:29.955
His station's coming up.

33
00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:58.358
Mind the doors.

34
00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:02.488
Is he coming in here?

35
00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:05.449
Oh. no. He never travels with us.

36
00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:25.511
Good morning. gentlemen.

37
00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.346
Good morning. Mr Williams.

38
00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.279
Come along. Mr Wakeling.

39
00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.652
- Good morning. Sir James
-  Hmm.

40
00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:06.862
Mr Rusbridger.
why has this D19 come back to us?

41
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:08.697
Mr Wright at Planning was of the view

42
00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.699
that a remittance certificate
should be attached to it.

43
00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.868
A remittance certificate
can only be issued

44
00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:15.204
after the D19 is authorised.

45
00:08:15.913 --> 00:08:18.415
Yes. I tried
to tell Mr Wright that. Mr Williams.

46
00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:19.917
but he simply won't have it.

47
00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:21.877
Then we can keep it here for now.

48
00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:26.048
It'll do no harm.

49
00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.309
Consider yourself very fortunate.
Mr Wakeling.

50
00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.811
Bequeathed one
of our tallest skyscrapers.

51
00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:41.855
Courtesy of Mr Woodward.
your predecessor.

52
00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.987
If your skyscraper
isn't very tall.

53
00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:52.407
or. God forbid. you work so fast
you don't have one at all.

54
00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.994
people will suspect you of not having
anything very important to do.

55
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.921
I see.

56
00:09:08.966 --> 00:09:10.968
So here's your first rule.
Mr Wakeling.

57
00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:12.302
Keep the skyscraper high.

58
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.223
The ladies from Chester Street. sir.

59
00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:18.267
Please show the ladies in. Mr Singh.

60
00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:23.146
Mr Middleton. your turn.

61
00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:25.190
if you don't mind.

62
00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.942
Of course. Mr Williams.

63
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.950
Mr Wakeling. perhaps you'd like
to assist Mr Middleton

64
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.952
- with the ladies.
- Of course. sir.

65
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:44.251
Ladies. How are we today?

66
00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:47.629
We were elsewhere
in this building all yesterday.

67
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.632
First at Parks. then at Planning...

68
00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:52.759
then at Cleansing and Sewage.

69
00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:54.553
Then just before closing yesterday.

70
00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:57.306
the gentleman said we were
to bring this to you.

71
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.481
Let me speak with Mr Williams.

72
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:08.692
Just a moment.

73
00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.573
Public Works.
how may I help?

74
00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.534
New here. ain't you?

75
00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.786
Yes. First day. actually.

76
00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:21.955
Well. you enjoy yourself. son.

77
00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:24.416
No end of entertainment
you'll get here.

78
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:25.542
Eliza.

79
00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.711
I'm just chatting
with the young gentleman.

80
00:10:28.337 --> 00:10:32.174
Your letter and your petition
are very well presented.

81
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.926
We. of course. know this from before.

82
00:10:35.052 --> 00:10:38.221
However. you must first take it
to Parks and Recreation

83
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.639
on the third floor.

84
00:10:39.765 --> 00:10:41.683
We were there yesterday. sir.

85
00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.894
They even thought
to offer us a bench to sit on.

86
00:10:43.894 --> 00:10:46.396
- That's how long we was there.
- Eliza.

87
00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:47.647
I do apologise.

88
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:50.442
And we don't wish you
any further inconvenience.

89
00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:53.320
So. Mr Williams has suggested
you be accompanied

90
00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:57.032
by a member of our staff to ensure
there's no further confusion.

91
00:10:58.617 --> 00:10:59.993
This is Mr Wakeling.

92
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:03.789
Oh!

93
00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:06.041
Splendid. Er ...

94
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.336
Splendid. Yes.
then I'll make sure. erm.

95
00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.421
all the confusion is...

96
00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.424
Well.
that's lovely. son.

97
00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:16.718
Then you'd better hop over
to our side of the fence.

98
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.678
Yes. quite right.
Thank you. Mr Singh.

99
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.806
If you ladies would care to follow me.

100
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.851
Allow me
to lead the way. Mr Wakeling.

101
00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.938
We're perhaps more familiar
with this building than you are.

102
00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.330
Forgive me. everyone.

103
00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:49.876
Unfortunately. I shall be obliged
to leave early.

104
00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:54.172
At twenty past three.

105
00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:58.677
Er. Mr Middleton. perhaps you'd be
so good as to deputise in my absence?

106
00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:03.932
Yes. of course. Mr Williams.

107
00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.268
I'll see everything stays shipshape.

108
00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.019
Thank you. Mr Middleton.

109
00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:16.736
Is it really true
you may be leaving us. Miss Harris?

110
00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:22.492
It's not certain yet. Mr Williams.

111
00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:28.874
I did have my interview
and it seemed to go well.

112
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.668
It's Lyons Corner House.

113
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.632
So. will you become one
of those. erm...

114
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.802
What do you call them?
Skippies? Nippies?

115
00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.929
You'll look fetching
in that apron. Miss Harris.

116
00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.307
It's an assistant
manager's post. Mr Hart.

117
00:12:45.307 --> 00:12:46.808
At least. once I've settled in.

118
00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.352
I wasn't trying
to be cheeky. Miss Harris.

119
00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.771
They do
an excellent treacle sponge.

120
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.232
At least the one
on Coventry Street does.

121
00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:58.737
Good idea. sir.

122
00:12:58.904 --> 00:13:00.155
Hmm?

123
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.032
Mr Wakeling. I mean.

124
00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.827
A playground
is what's sorely needed. love.

125
00:13:06.328 --> 00:13:07.704
There's nowhere
for them to play.

126
00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:10.081
A cesspool.
No other word for it.

127
00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.293
Rats the size of that.
And our houses backing right on to it.

128
00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:16.922
What on earth?

129
00:13:16.922 --> 00:13:18.924
You'll have
to get used to that. love.

130
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:32.354
So. you were saying
it was 'K' staircase?

131
00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:34.397
- Yeah. the 'K' staircase.
- Right. Righto.

132
00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:35.899
- It's the last one.
- Yes.

133
00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.275
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome. sir.

134
00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:38.443
Good morning.

135
00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:45.033
Er. this way. ladies. If you will.

136
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:07.556
Come on.

137
00:14:10.976 --> 00:14:13.228
-  Parks have insisted. sir...
-  That's all very well.

138
00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:14.646
but we've been through this before.
haven't we?

139
00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.648
- First we need all that water drained.

140
00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:20.235
I've explained this to you already.
Cleansing needs to look at it first.

141
00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:21.695
Good day. ladies.

142
00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.283
A children's playground.

143
00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:28.493
So. this isn't for us.

144
00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.412
But I'm sure
the Public Works Department

145
00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:32.080
will be pleased to assist you.

146
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.582
Public Works?

147
00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:35.750
That's where he's from.

148
00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:37.794
You're from Public Works?

149
00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:40.672
Well. yes. First day. actually.

150
00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.133
Then why on earth have you brought
these good ladies here?

151
00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.593
I do apologise.

152
00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:47.637
Yours is an excellent scheme
and I wish you well with it.

153
00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:50.223
Look here. take this back
to your office at once.

154
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:52.642
These ladies deserve better.

155
00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:53.810
Good day to you.

156
00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:30.722
Mr Wakeling. what may I do for you?

157
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.891
The ladies' petition. sir.

158
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:38.188
Mr Harvey at Cleansing insists.
er. that this is for us after all.

159
00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.149
Mr Harvey is quite wrong.

160
00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:45.278
But we can keep it here.
There's no harm.

161
00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:47.947
Thank you. Mr Wakeling.

162
00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.546
So. where
did you decide on in the end?

163
00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:47.590
Bournemouth.
Ten days starting next Monday.

164
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.885
Oh. lovely.
You must be looking forward to it.

165
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.722
Same guesthouse
we stayed in year before last.

166
00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.474
The lady there provides
a very nice supper.

167
00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:00.186
-  Next patient. please.
- Yes. Doctor.

168
00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.857
Mr Williams? Doctor will see you now.

169
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.151
Thank you.

170
00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:13.366
I much prefer the beach
in Bournemouth.

171
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:15.535
A pebble beach
is so uncomfortable.

172
00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.579
I couldn't agree more.

173
00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:22.041
Mr Williams.

174
00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.878
Please. sit down.

175
00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:29.382
Thank you.

176
00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:42.395
The results have come back.

177
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.485
I'm afraid this time
they're pretty conclusive.

178
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.411
It's never easy. this.

179
00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:03.333
Quite.

180
00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:10.340
And I said.
"Look. if that's what you want.

181
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.841
then I know a place
where you can get it".

182
00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:14.385
That's incredibly
wicked of you.

183
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.309
- Good evening. Miss Fry.
-  Good evening.

184
00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.145
-  Stop it.

185
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.357
- She's still watching us.
- How can she be?

186
00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.067
She doesn't have eyes
in the back of her head.

187
00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:31.653
I assure you she does.

188
00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:33.571
If your father's in.

189
00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:36.032
this is a good time to talk
about you know what.

190
00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.534
Not a good time.

191
00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:40.078
You'll have to start
the ball rolling at some stage.

192
00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:42.705
Yes. but not tonight. darling.
I'm really not up for it.

193
00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:44.499
Besides. he's not in.

194
00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.459
But this isn't
his cinema night.

195
00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:49.212
Hello? Dad?

196
00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.052
He missed his cinema
on Tuesday. so he's gone tonight.

197
00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:58.763
As I was saying.
you can't put it off forever. dear.

198
00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:02.141
I don't intend still to be
in this stifling house come Christmas.

199
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.226
Christmas?

200
00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.520
How can anyone purchase a house
and move in that sort of time?

201
00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.564
And besides. darling. it is his money.

202
00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:09.858
Your mother intended
that money for us all.

203
00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:12.610
What's he sitting on it for?
We're the ones who need it.

204
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.279
You have to speak to him. Michael.
I mean it.

205
00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:15.613
Mike...

206
00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.450
- Father. What on earth?
- Oh.

207
00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.828
Dad. you gave us a start.

208
00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:23.621
Thought you'd gone to the pictures.

209
00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.168
- Dad. are you alright?
- Yes.

210
00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:32.171
I was just...

211
00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:36.551
sitting here. erm.
thinking things over.

212
00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.345
And then you two walked in.

213
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.100
Will you sit for a while?

214
00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:49.105
- Well...
- No.

215
00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:51.774
We both have early starts.
I have to get ready for bed.

216
00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.568
You should too. dear.

217
00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:54.736
Goodnight.

218
00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:03.286
Well. better get going.

219
00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:05.747
- Heard what the boss just said.
- Yes.

220
00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:59.175
Come on. Mum's leaving us behind.

221
00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:20.446
Well done. your boy.

222
00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:24.450
Well done.

223
00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.254
I'm being serious.

224
00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:41.968
Chap like you needs a wife.

225
00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:46.431
As for your boy.
well. he'll come round to it.

226
00:21:46.597 --> 00:21:48.474
Youngsters get used to anything.

227
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.241
Dad!

228
00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:11.706
Dad.

229
00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:14.375
Dad!

230
00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:17.170
Michael.

231
00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:19.213
Would you lock up?

232
00:22:20.882 --> 00:22:22.884
We're not coming down again now.

233
00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:26.054
Dad?

234
00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:29.682
Dad. are you there?

235
00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:31.601
Yes.

236
00:22:34.228 --> 00:22:35.396
Night. then.

237
00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:36.773
Goodnight.

238
00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:14.477
He's never late.

239
00:23:14.477 --> 00:23:16.229
Something must have happened.

240
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.566
Daughter-in-law
said he'd left as usual this morning.

241
00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:26.864
Do you think we should. erm.
you know. alert the police. perhaps?

242
00:23:26.989 --> 00:23:29.117
Mr Williams
is hardly an infant.

243
00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:32.370
What will the police care that
he's a couple of hours late for work?

244
00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:34.789
"Couple of hours late
for work."

245
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:35.957
Who would ever have thought.

246
00:23:36.082 --> 00:23:38.584
Leaving early yesterday. Late today.

247
00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:41.754
Maybe he's just. you know.
decided he's had enough.

248
00:23:41.754 --> 00:23:44.340
Gonna give it all up.

249
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.802
I don't appreciate
that suggestion. Mr Hart.

250
00:23:47.802 --> 00:23:51.222
In fact.
I find it in rather poor taste.

251
00:23:53.474 --> 00:23:55.893
Pity he should choose today
of all days.

252
00:23:57.186 --> 00:23:59.147
Why is that. Miss Harris?

253
00:24:00.022 --> 00:24:03.234
Because the Lyons Corner House
have requested my reference.

254
00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:04.861
So. I need Mr Williams to...

255
00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:07.155
If it's a reference you're after.
Miss Harris.

256
00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:10.283
I'll be happy to step in
as Mr Williams' deputy.

257
00:24:10.408 --> 00:24:12.827
Hang on.
He's just a little late. that's all.

258
00:24:12.827 --> 00:24:14.370
- No need for you to...
-  Quite.

259
00:24:14.495 --> 00:24:15.913
Thank you. Mr Middleton.

260
00:24:15.913 --> 00:24:18.499
but I'd prefer to wait
for Mr Williams to return.

261
00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:24.922
How can it be that
in this resort town of ours.

262
00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:28.217
insomniacs converging
from every corner of the land.

263
00:24:28.342 --> 00:24:29.677
a fellow's not able
to buy such a thing

264
00:24:29.677 --> 00:24:31.304
- as a sleeping tablet?
- Oh.

265
00:24:31.429 --> 00:24:35.057
you don't half go on. Mr Sutherland.

266
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:37.643
If you was really sleeping
as little as you say...

267
00:24:37.643 --> 00:24:39.312
I don't see how your brain

268
00:24:39.312 --> 00:24:42.690
could keep coming up
with them ridiculous phrases.

269
00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:45.443
Never mind your...

270
00:24:45.443 --> 00:24:49.405
well. "entertainments"
shall we call them.

271
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.992
Consider. I beg you.
my last great work.

272
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.453
"Shocking Stockings."

273
00:24:55.578 --> 00:24:59.332
Now. I very much suspect you judged it
to be smutty and trivial.

274
00:24:59.332 --> 00:25:02.752
You know very well. Mr Sutherland.
I never saw it.

275
00:25:02.877 --> 00:25:07.131
My point exactly. The dramatic vision
of your most loyal customer

276
00:25:07.131 --> 00:25:09.926
and you shun it.
You turn away with a blush.

277
00:25:10.051 --> 00:25:11.844
Would it have been that way in Paris?

278
00:25:12.011 --> 00:25:15.014
Where. triumphantly disowned
by my entire family

279
00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:18.100
I so deliciously misspent my youth.

280
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.353
The night. the wine. the women.

281
00:25:20.353 --> 00:25:22.980
the cabaret. the Moulin Rouge.

282
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.524
Who knows. Mrs Blake?
Had you been born French.

283
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:28.486
you might even now be kicking high
those lovely legs of yours

284
00:25:28.486 --> 00:25:31.280
for the appreciation
of a discerning audience.

285
00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:33.658
Mr Sutherland. really!

286
00:25:33.658 --> 00:25:37.078
This little town of ours. Mrs Blake.
English it may be.

287
00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:39.789
but I still have
high ambitions for it.

288
00:25:39.914 --> 00:25:42.917
Bournemouth. Bognor Regis.
they're long beyond reach.

289
00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:45.711
But here. hope still lingers.

290
00:25:46.837 --> 00:25:49.757
I could achieve all this.

291
00:25:49.882 --> 00:25:53.803
all this and more for this town.
if only...

292
00:25:55.304 --> 00:25:56.764
if only I could sleep.

293
00:25:58.057 --> 00:25:59.141
Excuse me.

294
00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:03.771
I don't mean to intrude.

295
00:26:03.896 --> 00:26:05.064
You do not intrude. sir.

296
00:26:05.064 --> 00:26:07.900
In fact. you are most welcome
to join our conference here.

297
00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:09.860
That's most kind.

298
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.073
But I wondered if I might have
a private word with the gentleman.

299
00:26:15.199 --> 00:26:18.619
I see. yeah.
Well. I'll leave you to it.

300
00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:22.081
The things that go on.

301
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.628
Well. sir. may I take it
you're inviting me aboard?

302
00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:29.422
If you'd care to.

303
00:26:34.677 --> 00:26:37.346
Excuse me. I just thought...

304
00:26:38.139 --> 00:26:40.391
overhearing what you were saying...

305
00:26:40.391 --> 00:26:41.475
Yes.

306
00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:43.602
If you like...

307
00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:48.482
you're welcome to these.

308
00:26:51.319 --> 00:26:54.864
Very kind of you. old man.
It's just what I need.

309
00:26:56.699 --> 00:26:57.700
And...

310
00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:06.292
these.

311
00:27:11.672 --> 00:27:13.591
Rather a lot. old man.

312
00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:20.765
I'm grateful to you.
I'll take them off your hands.

313
00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:22.224
I did think about it.

314
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.521
But I don't have it in me.
that kind of thing.

315
00:27:28.314 --> 00:27:30.858
Think of the inconvenience
to your landlady.

316
00:27:33.194 --> 00:27:35.738
Odd. I thought about exactly that.

317
00:27:42.536 --> 00:27:43.788
It's not

318
00:27:44.246 --> 00:27:46.957
perhaps quite what you think.

319
00:27:49.585 --> 00:27:51.045
You see...

320
00:27:51.879 --> 00:27:55.341
this is rather a bore. but the doctors
have given me six months.

321
00:27:56.384 --> 00:27:58.886
Eight or nine at a stretch.

322
00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:02.473
I'm so sorry.

323
00:28:06.227 --> 00:28:07.228
Funny.

324
00:28:10.856 --> 00:28:12.483
You're the first person I've told.

325
00:28:19.573 --> 00:28:21.659
The thing is. I just came down here.

326
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.165
Look. you're...

327
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:31.752
You're most welcome to those.
I've no more need of them.

328
00:28:34.672 --> 00:28:35.881
Six months.

329
00:28:36.382 --> 00:28:37.425
Nine.

330
00:28:38.676 --> 00:28:41.345
It doesn't seem long.
but it's something.

331
00:28:42.555 --> 00:28:46.851
Enough time to put things in order
and to live a little. if you chose to.

332
00:28:46.851 --> 00:28:50.521
I withdrew some cash.
It's almost half my life's savings.

333
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:52.898
Look here. old chap. Enough of that.

334
00:28:53.023 --> 00:28:55.025
You need to be more careful.

335
00:28:59.947 --> 00:29:01.115
You see my problem.

336
00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:05.744
I withdrew this cash
and came down here to...

337
00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:14.044
Enjoy myself. or live a little.
as you put it.

338
00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:17.089
But I realise...

339
00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:22.511
I don't know how.

340
00:30:10.392 --> 00:30:11.519
Yes!

341
00:30:28.202 --> 00:30:29.662
Then he needed
to be tough.

342
00:30:31.705 --> 00:30:33.207
No. no. no. No. no.

343
00:30:34.083 --> 00:30:37.795
When a girl like that steals your hat.
always cheaper to buy a new one.

344
00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:42.007
Out with the old.
New phase of life!

345
00:30:46.804 --> 00:30:49.557
You see. that hat. That's not bad.

346
00:30:49.807 --> 00:30:52.101
That could work.
Do you know what I mean?

347
00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:55.896
Can you imagine something like that?

348
00:30:56.146 --> 00:30:58.732
I think that's good.
I'm gonna talk to him.

349
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:02.778
I'm gonna talk to him.
because I think. for the right price

350
00:31:02.778 --> 00:31:05.406
- we can get that.
- Well. I. there's no need.

351
00:31:05.573 --> 00:31:07.908
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- Really?

352
00:31:12.246 --> 00:31:15.165
Show you something really special.
Strictly VIPs only.

353
00:31:19.378 --> 00:31:22.047
♪ Yes. we have no bananas

354
00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:24.675
♪ We have no bananas today ♪

355
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:28.596
And so it falls to me to steer
the family line as a playwright.

356
00:31:29.263 --> 00:31:33.392
Hattie. this here is my friend.
Mr Rodney Williams of Esher. Surrey.

357
00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:35.978
And. do you know. that this man
before you now is grievously ill.

358
00:31:35.978 --> 00:31:38.355
Then why is he drinking?

359
00:31:38.355 --> 00:31:40.649
Why indeed?

360
00:31:40.649 --> 00:31:45.988
He has decided to grasp life.
what little of it remains to him.

361
00:31:46.113 --> 00:31:48.198
And we have to admire him for it.

362
00:31:49.658 --> 00:31:51.952
Don't you admire him. Hattie?

363
00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:55.831
If he's ill.
then this ain't good for him.

364
00:31:55.956 --> 00:31:59.001
Hattie. you don't understand.
This man. until yesterday

365
00:31:59.001 --> 00:32:03.172
was living a shell of an existence.
has sprung to life.

366
00:32:03.172 --> 00:32:05.591
Look. He even has a new hat.

367
00:32:09.595 --> 00:32:11.930
Alright. alright.
Come on. come on.

368
00:32:12.056 --> 00:32:14.433
What else do we know?
Who wants to be next?

369
00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:16.560
Yeah. I. yes.

370
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.979
Yes. I have a song.

371
00:32:18.979 --> 00:32:21.231
And what can you offer us. sir?

372
00:32:21.398 --> 00:32:23.067
Erm. I have a...

373
00:32:23.192 --> 00:32:26.779
I have a little Scotch on my.
on my mother's side.

374
00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:28.906
Looks like you've got a little bit
of Scotch in you right now. mate.

375
00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:32.951
You're right. I am somewhat.

376
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:36.163
but I'd like to sing you a song.
if I may.

377
00:32:36.163 --> 00:32:39.208
If you happen to know. erm.

378
00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:41.877
The Rowan Tree. Do you know the...?

379
00:32:41.877 --> 00:32:44.963
Rowan Tree. Old Scottish song. right?

380
00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:49.176
Yeah. I have a little Scotch in me.
My late wife. too.

381
00:32:49.385 --> 00:32:51.428
Erm. she was. erm...

I'm so sorry.

400
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:45.959
Come along. old man.
I'll show you another place I know.

401
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:00.130
Mr Williams?

402
00:39:02.174 --> 00:39:03.717
Mr Williams?

403
00:39:04.301 --> 00:39:06.470
Oh! Oh. it is you.

404
00:39:06.595 --> 00:39:10.348
I was quite thrown there for a minute.
I mean. by your new hat.

405
00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:13.018
Ah. yes. I lost my old one.

406
00:39:13.018 --> 00:39:15.479
Well. it's jolly nice.

407
00:39:15.604 --> 00:39:17.397
I do wonder what they'll make of it
at the office.

408
00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:20.067
Yes. I wonder

409
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:23.236
What would be your guess. Miss Harris?

410
00:39:23.236 --> 00:39:26.490
Will my new hat go down a storm there?

411
00:39:28.116 --> 00:39:31.411
Noah himself couldn't get something
to go down a storm with that lot.

412
00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:32.871
I don't need to worry
about them any more.

413
00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.331
because I have a new job

414
00:39:34.456 --> 00:39:37.542
- Oh. yes?
- That's why I'm so pleased to see you.

415
00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:40.087
Well. it's not the only reason.
of course.

416
00:39:40.212 --> 00:39:43.173
I'm very glad to see that you're well
and going about your business.

417
00:39:43.173 --> 00:39:46.301
When you didn't come in yesterday.
and the day before...

418
00:39:46.426 --> 00:39:49.304
Yes. I have rather gone to ground.

419
00:39:49.429 --> 00:39:53.225
But you see. I've had other. erm...

420
00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:58.772
Never mind. Tell me more
about your new job. Miss Harris.

421
00:39:58.772 --> 00:40:00.690
You know about it. Mr Williams.

422
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.568
It's the position
at the Lyons Corner House.

423
00:40:03.693 --> 00:40:05.904
A branch just around the corner
from here.

424
00:40:05.904 --> 00:40:07.739
An assistant manager's role.

425
00:40:07.864 --> 00:40:09.991
At least once I get
into the swing of things.

426
00:40:10.617 --> 00:40:12.410
I'm so excited. Sorry.

427
00:40:12.577 --> 00:40:13.578
No.

428
00:40:13.703 --> 00:40:15.539
- I didn't mean...
- Don't worry.

429
00:40:15.664 --> 00:40:17.582
County Hall is not for everyone.

430
00:40:21.044 --> 00:40:24.089
I am pleased to see you. Mr Williams.
I'm going to be honest.

431
00:40:24.214 --> 00:40:27.551
I do have the job.
but it's subject to a reference.

432
00:40:27.676 --> 00:40:29.594
- Ah.
- And because you were away...

433
00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:32.389
I see how
I may have inconvenienced you.

434
00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:38.520
I was thinking of treating myself
to a light lunch at Fortnum's.

435
00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:41.815
If you'd care to join me.

436
00:40:41.982 --> 00:40:43.775
I could write your reference
over lunch.

437
00:40:44.734 --> 00:40:46.945
- Really?
- Why not?

438
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.865
It might make up
for the inconvenience I've caused you.

439
00:40:51.241 --> 00:40:52.284
Fortnum's?

440
00:40:55.912 --> 00:40:58.039
You know. Mr Williams.
when I see you bowed

441
00:40:58.165 --> 00:40:59.708
over your paperwork like that

442
00:40:59.708 --> 00:41:01.877
I suddenly remember
you are the same person.

443
00:41:02.878 --> 00:41:05.088
The one at the head of our desk.
every morning and afternoon

444
00:41:05.213 --> 00:41:08.175
for the last 16 months of my life.

445
00:41:12.053 --> 00:41:14.222
But now I realise.
you're not really like that at all.

446
00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:16.975
There's so much more to you.

447
00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:20.103
I mean. Fortnum's!

448
00:41:20.228 --> 00:41:21.313
Your new hat.

449
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.732
I won't give you
a more favourable reference

450
00:41:23.732 --> 00:41:25.483
because you say things like that.

451
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:30.405
I'm not trying to butter you up.
Mr Williams.

452
00:41:31.573 --> 00:41:33.742
I'm saying I got you wrong.
that's all.

453
00:41:43.043 --> 00:41:45.212
Mr Williams. if you promise.

454
00:41:45.212 --> 00:41:47.339
and I mean really promise
to not get angry.

455
00:41:47.464 --> 00:41:50.133
I'll tell you my secret nickname
for you.

456
00:41:56.473 --> 00:41:59.226
- I promise.
- And you really mustn't get cross.

457
00:41:59.643 --> 00:42:01.770
It's not just you.
I have them for everyone.

458
00:42:01.895 --> 00:42:05.148
Only I know about them and my cousin.
Rosemary. who I share rooms with.

459
00:42:05.273 --> 00:42:06.274
I see.

460
00:42:06.399 --> 00:42:09.027
For instance. Mr Rusbridger.

461
00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:10.904
I call him The Hover Man.

462
00:42:11.029 --> 00:42:13.240
Because he just hovers his pen
over the page

463
00:42:13.823 --> 00:42:18.078
with the intention of doing work
but never actually doing work.

464
00:42:23.833 --> 00:42:25.543
And Mr Hart.

465
00:42:26.211 --> 00:42:27.587
Well...

466
00:42:27.796 --> 00:42:29.506
I call him The Confused Chimney.

467
00:42:30.257 --> 00:42:33.593
Because he's constantly smoking
and constantly bewildered.

468
00:42:34.844 --> 00:42:36.596
Have you seen his eyebrows?

469
00:42:39.015 --> 00:42:40.934
Mr Rusbridger.
on my desk.

470
00:42:40.934 --> 00:42:42.310
Doesn't have a clue.

471
00:42:42.852 --> 00:42:44.437
It's very good.

472
00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:47.983
Alright. This time. I'll say the name.
you have to guess who it is.

473
00:42:47.983 --> 00:42:51.528
He's on the fourth floor.
Julius Caesar.

474
00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:55.240
Julius Caesar. Well...

475
00:42:55.657 --> 00:42:58.159
I suppose that would be.

476
00:42:58.285 --> 00:43:01.204
er. Mr Brown. in accounts?

477
00:43:01.621 --> 00:43:02.622
Correct!

478
00:43:06.376 --> 00:43:08.545
Excuse me.
May I get you something else?

479
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:09.754
A dessert?

480
00:43:11.214 --> 00:43:15.719
Erm. not for me.
But perhaps the young lady might.

481
00:43:15.844 --> 00:43:17.178
Yes.

482
00:43:17.178 --> 00:43:20.140
Oh. I've always wanted one
of those ice-cream sundaes.

483
00:43:20.265 --> 00:43:21.683
A Knickerbocker Glory. miss?

484
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:23.893
Yes. please.
With the fruit and nuts on top.

485
00:43:24.019 --> 00:43:25.854
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

486
00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:28.940
Are you sure this is alright?

487
00:43:29.357 --> 00:43:30.650
Of course.

488
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.240
But. Miss Harris. you haven't
come around to your main point.

489
00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:40.785
You were going
to tell me your name for me.

490
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:45.165
Oh. no. it's a silly nickname.

491
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:46.416
I don't think I'll tell you.

492
00:43:46.541 --> 00:43:49.294
No. no. You've come this far.
You have to tell me.

493
00:43:52.714 --> 00:43:53.715
Alright.

494
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.760
Remember your promise.
To not get angry.

495
00:43:59.554 --> 00:44:00.555
Mr Zombie.

496
00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:02.432
Mr what?

497
00:44:03.308 --> 00:44:04.351
Thank you.

498
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:06.853
Mr Zombie.

499
00:44:07.354 --> 00:44:11.316
I saw a film about it
with what's her name.

500
00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:12.817
Erm...

501
00:44:12.817 --> 00:44:15.737
Zombies are sort
of like Egyptian mummies.

502
00:44:16.446 --> 00:44:19.824
but they can walk
and go about doing things.

503
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:22.285
They're sort of dead but not dead.

504
00:44:24.746 --> 00:44:25.955
Mr Zombie.

505
00:44:26.581 --> 00:44:28.792
My. my.

506
00:44:33.046 --> 00:44:36.091
I'm so sorry. Mr Williams.
That's really wicked of me.

507
00:44:37.592 --> 00:44:39.803
You mustn't be upset. Miss Harris.

508
00:44:41.137 --> 00:44:43.640
Mr Zombie. It's rather good.

509
00:44:44.516 --> 00:44:47.685
It's quite appropriate. in fact.
I like it. Mr Zombie.

510
00:44:48.228 --> 00:44:50.063
An Egyptian mummy.

511
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.942
- Except I can move about.

512
00:44:53.942 --> 00:44:56.653
- Your Knickerbocker Glory. miss.
- Thank you so much.

513
00:44:58.405 --> 00:44:59.781
Mmm.

514
00:46:11.644 --> 00:46:14.981
I'd better be on the 4:56.

515
00:46:15.106 --> 00:46:18.234
Or else I might find myself sharing
the same train as our colleagues.

516
00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:19.944
That would be awkward.

517
00:46:19.944 --> 00:46:22.655
I do wonder.
we haven't been terribly wicked?

518
00:46:24.365 --> 00:46:27.744
You don't have to worry about
that any more. Miss Harris.

519
00:46:27.744 --> 00:46:30.455
You just keep your mind
on your Lyons Corner House.

520
00:46:30.622 --> 00:46:33.124
I will. I was thinking about you.

521
00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:34.292
Ah!

522
00:46:36.044 --> 00:46:37.378
Don't worry about me.

523
00:46:38.838 --> 00:46:40.381
I've had a wonderful afternoon.

524
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:42.592
- So have I.
- Well. Miss Harris...

525
00:46:44.344 --> 00:46:47.555
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Mr Williams.

526
00:47:06.658 --> 00:47:08.743
No doubt
she'll pop back Monday.

527
00:47:12.288 --> 00:47:14.916
It's rather bad form really. isn't it?

528
00:47:14.916 --> 00:47:16.209
Even if she is leaving.

529
00:47:16.376 --> 00:47:18.002
We know
it's a Lyons Corner House.

530
00:47:19.504 --> 00:47:21.923
Er. Mr Middleton. as Acting Head

531
00:47:22.048 --> 00:47:24.217
wouldn't you be able simply
to look it up?

532
00:47:27.262 --> 00:47:29.639
That would be highly irregular.
Mr Rusbridger.

533
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:33.851
What. even if there may be far more
than curiosity at stake?

534
00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:37.355
Look. really! Really. I...

535
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.403
I do wish Mr Williams would come back.
Perhaps things would go back to

536
00:47:43.528 --> 00:47:45.655
being a bit more orderly.

537
00:47:59.544 --> 00:48:01.879
People in this neighbourhood
go up to town

538
00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:03.798
and if they were
to see your father-in-law.

539
00:48:03.923 --> 00:48:06.259
just as I did. with this young woman

540
00:48:06.259 --> 00:48:09.971
goodness knows what they would think
and how would that reflect on you

541
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:12.348
living in the same household?

542
00:48:13.391 --> 00:48:15.935
That's why I just wanted to tell you.
Well. good evening.

543
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.061
Come on.

544
00:48:17.228 --> 00:48:18.855
The woman
is a public nuisance.

545
00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:23.443
A prize mischief maker.

546
00:48:24.652 --> 00:48:26.154
Nothing she likes better
than to put...

547
00:48:26.279 --> 00:48:27.280
Shh!

548
00:48:30.033 --> 00:48:31.200
Look. are...

549
00:48:32.493 --> 00:48:34.287
Are we really supposed
to believe that my...

550
00:48:34.287 --> 00:48:35.830
You have to speak to him.

551
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.124
If people are talking
about this here.

552
00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:49.886
Look here.
There's something

553
00:48:50.053 --> 00:48:52.472
I want to share with you both.

554
00:48:53.806 --> 00:48:55.016
It's. erm...

555
00:48:56.184 --> 00:48:58.061
It's a bit of a bore. really.

556
00:48:58.394 --> 00:49:00.355
But. erm...

557
00:49:01.731 --> 00:49:04.525
I probably should. erm...

558
00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:16.079
It's outrageous.

559
00:49:16.954 --> 00:49:18.289
At his age.

560
00:49:22.835 --> 00:49:25.922
And as for this girl. Barely a woman.

561
00:49:26.631 --> 00:49:28.633
- Certainly not a lady.
- It does all fit.

562
00:49:28.758 --> 00:49:30.843
The calls from his office.
The savings.

563
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:32.845
You simply must speak to him.

564
00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:34.931
You should have done so long ago.
About everything.

565
00:49:35.056 --> 00:49:36.474
I'll speak to him. alright.

566
00:49:39.185 --> 00:49:42.105
With pleasure. I'll speak to him.

567
00:49:45.233 --> 00:49:46.567
Look here.

568
00:49:46.693 --> 00:49:51.656
There's something I should probably
talk to you. erm. about.

569
00:49:55.868 --> 00:49:56.869
I...

570
00:50:10.466 --> 00:50:12.969
Oh. here you are. Father.

571
00:50:26.232 --> 00:50:27.400
Smells wonderful.

572
00:50:28.443 --> 00:50:30.528
Er. yes. I do hope you'll enjoy it.

573
00:50:39.412 --> 00:50:40.413
Mmm.

574
00:50:41.664 --> 00:50:44.876
Alf Jordan sprained his ankle
while on holiday.

575
00:50:45.668 --> 00:50:47.587
Unlikely to be fit
for the start of the season.

576
00:50:47.587 --> 00:50:49.297
Oh dear. How unfortunate.

577
00:50:51.924 --> 00:50:53.551
It's a bit of a...

578
00:50:54.594 --> 00:50:56.596
bit of a bore. really.

579
00:50:56.596 --> 00:50:59.182
Darling. this is hardly the time
to be reading.

580
00:51:00.558 --> 00:51:02.143
Sorry.

581
00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:03.561
Are we ready?

582
00:51:03.686 --> 00:51:04.896
Of course. we're ready.

583
00:51:04.896 --> 00:51:06.606
Ready as we'll ever be.

584
00:51:12.445 --> 00:51:13.738
Shepherd's pie.

585
00:51:13.863 --> 00:51:16.365
Yes. And decent mince too.

586
00:51:34.133 --> 00:51:35.134
Shall I serve?

587
00:51:37.053 --> 00:51:38.054
No.

588
00:51:47.688 --> 00:51:48.731
Ah...

589
00:51:50.066 --> 00:51:51.150
how splendid.

590
00:52:02.411 --> 00:52:03.496
Thank you. darling.

591
00:52:29.981 --> 00:52:33.150
There was a time
when what one did in London

592
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:34.318
stayed in London.

593
00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:37.572
But these days.
half of the street works in London.

594
00:52:41.701 --> 00:52:43.202
Well. that's right. my dear.

595
00:52:46.581 --> 00:52:48.416
Half the street.

596
00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:17.815
Miss?

597
00:55:18.357 --> 00:55:19.525
Miss!

598
00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:22.236
The sausage roll is cold.

599
00:55:22.403 --> 00:55:23.863
Oh. I'm so sorry.

600
00:55:24.113 --> 00:55:26.240
-  Miss?
- Yes. One minute. sir.

601
00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.491
You're new here. aren't you?

602
00:55:27.616 --> 00:55:29.702
Haven't quite found your feet yet.

603
00:55:31.537 --> 00:55:33.122
Shall I bring you
something else. madam?

604
00:55:33.122 --> 00:55:34.498
Some. some more tea. perhaps?

605
00:55:35.374 --> 00:55:36.625
I shall think about it.

606
00:55:38.377 --> 00:55:39.420
Excuse me.

607
00:55:39.545 --> 00:55:40.713
Miss? Miss!

608
00:55:42.298 --> 00:55:44.175
Make it snappy. please.
It's getting very busy.

609
00:55:44.175 --> 00:55:45.301
Of course. Mr Adams.

610
00:55:45.426 --> 00:55:46.719
Mr Williams.

611
00:55:46.886 --> 00:55:48.471
Skiving again.

612
00:55:48.471 --> 00:55:49.597
I'm disappointed.

613
00:55:49.597 --> 00:55:51.599
And. Miss Harris.
I'm disappointed to find you.

614
00:55:51.766 --> 00:55:54.185
well into your third week here.
still working as a waitress.

615
00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:56.979
It was an assistant manager's post
you accepted?

616
00:55:56.979 --> 00:55:58.147
Yes.

617
00:55:58.606 --> 00:56:01.108
Well. I hope to be given
greater responsibilities in good time.

618
00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:03.444
If you wish.
I might speak with your supervisor.

619
00:56:03.569 --> 00:56:05.321
No. that won't be necessary.
thank you.

620
00:56:05.863 --> 00:56:07.656
Mr Williams. why haven't you returned
to the office?

621
00:56:07.656 --> 00:56:09.283
You did say. last time.
that you would.

622
00:56:09.408 --> 00:56:10.409
Yes.

623
00:56:10.534 --> 00:56:13.537
As it happens.
I was just now thinking about that.

624
00:56:14.288 --> 00:56:16.415
Erm. after all. it's not as if

625
00:56:16.582 --> 00:56:19.877
I've found a wealth of other ways
to occupy my time.

626
00:56:20.002 --> 00:56:21.170
Mr Williams. it's very busy.

627
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:23.506
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. of course. I'll let you go.

628
00:56:23.631 --> 00:56:25.424
But. I am...

629
00:56:27.301 --> 00:56:29.678
I did wonder
when your present shift ended.

630
00:56:31.055 --> 00:56:32.515
Why would you mind about that?

631
00:56:33.516 --> 00:56:34.683
Why?

632
00:56:35.434 --> 00:56:37.520
Well. for one thing.
because they're showing

633
00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.022
I Was A Male War Bride
at the pictures.

634
00:56:40.147 --> 00:56:42.149
And I wondered
if you'd care to come along.

635
00:56:42.274 --> 00:56:44.693
No. I shan't be encouraging
this skiving any longer.

636
00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:47.196
You need to get
back to the office. alright?

637
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:48.405
What will they be thinking?

638
00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:51.075
- Er. yes. But. you see. today...

639
00:56:52.493 --> 00:56:55.454
...is my pictures day.

640
00:56:57.248 --> 00:57:00.543
Er. and I was merely wishing
for a companion.

641
00:57:01.585 --> 00:57:02.628
Oh. well.

642
00:57:06.757 --> 00:57:08.551
Cary Grant. Miss Harris.

643
00:57:09.718 --> 00:57:13.055
I understood you were...
quite fond of him.

644
00:57:15.516 --> 00:57:17.309
Any female trouble?

645
00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:19.770
Nothing much. Sergeant.

646
00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:26.026
Have you ever had any children before?

647
00:57:26.193 --> 00:57:28.070
Oh. my aching back.

648
00:57:28.195 --> 00:57:30.156
You know
that awful feeling before breakfast?

649
00:57:30.322 --> 00:57:31.323
No. Captain. I don't.

650
00:57:31.323 --> 00:57:32.491
Oh. Sergeant. you're lucky.

651
00:57:42.459 --> 00:57:43.460
Yes!

652
00:57:43.711 --> 00:57:44.753
- Ha!

653
00:57:52.595 --> 00:57:53.804
Mr Williams.

654
00:57:53.804 --> 00:57:56.348
It's time I was going home.
My cousin will be getting concerned.

655
00:57:56.515 --> 00:57:57.641
Oh. of course.

656
00:57:57.641 --> 00:57:59.393
But. erm. look at this.

657
00:57:59.518 --> 00:58:02.188
It may seem easy.
but I assure you it isn't.

658
00:58:04.857 --> 00:58:06.066
Look.

659
00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:11.614
Ohh.

660
00:58:11.822 --> 00:58:13.324
It's so difficult.

661
00:58:13.449 --> 00:58:15.075
Mr Williams. I really must be going.

662
00:58:15.284 --> 00:58:17.036
Oh. Oh. of course.

663
00:58:17.161 --> 00:58:18.162
But before you go. Miss Harris.

664
00:58:18.162 --> 00:58:20.289
wouldn't you like
to have a try yourself?

665
00:58:20.414 --> 00:58:22.917
I have a feeling. you see.
that you'd be rather good at this.

666
00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:24.293
It's the rabbit.

667
00:58:24.585 --> 00:58:26.170
It's the rabbit we're after.

668
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:28.005
Very well. Just once. Then I'll go.

669
00:58:42.853 --> 00:58:44.813
It's not nearly as easy as it. erm...

670
00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:50.736
Oh. I say!

671
00:58:51.028 --> 00:58:53.447
Well done. Miss Harris. well done.

672
00:58:53.447 --> 00:58:55.199
I might have known you could do it.

673
00:58:57.159 --> 00:58:58.661
Right. Now I'm going.

674
00:58:58.869 --> 00:59:00.162
Yes. of course.

675
00:59:00.913 --> 00:59:02.706
I'll walk you to your bus.

676
00:59:03.207 --> 00:59:04.375
Bravo. Miss Harris.

677
00:59:14.009 --> 00:59:15.261
Miss Harris?

678
00:59:21.475 --> 00:59:22.810
What is it. Mr Williams?

679
00:59:22.977 --> 00:59:23.978
I wondered...

680
00:59:24.603 --> 00:59:27.856
if you'd... join me for a drink.

681
00:59:28.691 --> 00:59:31.360
A few mins. that's all.

682
00:59:33.404 --> 00:59:34.863
Because you see. I...

683
00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:41.620
...I don't... I don't feel quite able
to go home just yet.

684
01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.517
Oh. this isn't very nice. really.
is it. Mr Williams?

685
01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:07.896
I know it's quite innocent.
and I'm not implying anything. but...

686
01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:12.943
Well. you're much older than me.

687
01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:17.906
And someone.
someone might suppose that...

688
01:00:20.159 --> 01:00:21.827
you're becoming infatuated.

689
01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.711
Infatuated?

690
01:00:37.885 --> 01:00:41.638
I suppose. in a way. I am.

691
01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:47.019
But not quite as some might suppose.

692
01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:53.692
I realised. since you arrived.
how very different it had been.

693
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:58.655
I confess I did at times worry
if your attitude was. well...

694
01:01:00.783 --> 01:01:01.784
appropriate.

695
01:01:01.784 --> 01:01:04.703
But I came to appreciate you.

696
01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:08.791
And. and not. not simply
for your youth.

697
01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:11.418
There was some other quality.

698
01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:12.795
Your...

699
01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.338
appetite for life.

700
01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:17.132
Your... the way you always make
everything jolly and gay.

701
01:01:17.132 --> 01:01:19.760
Even while working there with us.

702
01:01:19.927 --> 01:01:21.261
Mr Williams...

703
01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:24.390
I'm-- I'm just an ordinary person
like everybody else.

704
01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.726
I-- I have no such special quality.

705
01:01:28.227 --> 01:01:29.770
I try to stay cheerful.

706
01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:30.938
That's true. but--

707
01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:33.857
Miss Harris.
I wonder if I may confide in you.

708
01:01:36.527 --> 01:01:39.863
There's something
I haven't really told anyone else.

709
01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:41.490
Not even my son.

710
01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:46.370
It's quite...

711
01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:51.291
a bore. really. but the fact is...

712
01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.341
The fact is I'm not expected
to live much longer.

713
01:02:00.801 --> 01:02:02.469
I have a cancer. Here.

714
01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:11.562
After receiving my news. I...

715
01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:16.108
I took to looking
around myself a little.

716
01:02:16.275 --> 01:02:18.735
And that day
I saw you in Piccadilly...

717
01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:22.239
I thought. "Look at her.

718
01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.285
"Look at Miss Harris.

719
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:32.332
"If I'm only to be alive like her
for one day."

720
01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:38.005
I suppose I...

721
01:02:38.714 --> 01:02:41.049
I hoped you'd show me. or...

722
01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:43.552
teach me to be like you.

723
01:02:44.553 --> 01:02:47.764
Mr Williams... your son.

724
01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.433
Why haven't you told your son?

725
01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:50.767
Well...

726
01:02:53.896 --> 01:02:55.647
I think the world of Michael.

727
01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.610
However. he's now...

728
01:03:02.738 --> 01:03:04.406
He has his own life to live.

729
01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:06.992
his own concerns.
and that's as it should be.

730
01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:12.080
But you're correct.
I'm behaving like an old fool.

731
01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:16.418
What was it. your name for me?

732
01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:19.129
Mr Zombie.

733
01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:22.674
Yes. Mr Zombie.

734
01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.843
I wasn't always.

735
01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:28.055
When I was your age.

736
01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:30.516
from when I was this high.

737
01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:32.976
what I wanted...

738
01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:38.023
was to be a gentleman.

739
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:42.486
Nothing grand. Just a rank
and file sort of gentleman.

740
01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:48.700
I used to see them in the mornings.
all lined up at the railway station.

741
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:52.621
whenever I went there with my mother
in their suits and hats.

742
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:54.873
waiting on the platform
to go into London.

743
01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:57.167
A gentleman like that.

744
01:03:57.918 --> 01:03:59.211
That's what...

745
01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:01.630
That's what I longed to be one day.

746
01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:14.851
How did it happen?

747
01:04:18.564 --> 01:04:20.774
I fancy it just crept up on me.

748
01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:23.610
Just one day proceeding the next.

749
01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:26.989
A small wonder I didn't notice...

750
01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:29.449
what I was becoming.

751
01:04:33.245 --> 01:04:35.163
And then I looked at you.

752
01:04:38.959 --> 01:04:40.210
And I remembered...

753
01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:45.465
what it was like
to be alive like that.

754
01:04:54.683 --> 01:04:57.060
I wonder if you ever stop
on the way home

755
01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:58.812
and watch the children playing.

756
01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:02.691
In the street. or in the yard.

757
01:05:03.692 --> 01:05:06.612
And when the time comes
and their mothers call them in.

758
01:05:07.154 --> 01:05:12.409
they're often reluctant.
They. they get a little contrary.

759
01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:14.494
But that's as it should be.

760
01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:19.082
Far better that than to be the child
you occasionally see.

761
01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:23.462
he's sitting by himself in the corner
not taking part

762
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:26.340
not happy. not unhappy.

763
01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.425
Merely waiting
for his mother to call him in.

764
01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:35.474
I've become afraid
that I might end up like that child.

765
01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:41.396
And I so very much
do not wish to do so.

766
01:05:45.317 --> 01:05:49.780
When the time comes.
when my Maker calls me...

767
01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.216
Miss Harris...

768
01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:13.428
I hope you'll able to forgive me.
Please forgive me for everything.

769
01:06:13.428 --> 01:06:15.681
I've kept you far too long.

770
01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:17.432
We must get you to your bus stop.

771
01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:20.811
Mr Williams. are you all right?

772
01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:24.898
Never better. But we must hurry.
Your cousin will be anxious.

773
01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:40.205
Good morning. Mr Singh.
Would you come with me.

774
01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:45.293
-  Good morning. everyone.
-  Oh. Mr Williams. sir.

775
01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:47.921
- Welcome back. sir.
- Mr Hart.

776
01:06:48.213 --> 01:06:50.632
Our file on the bomb site
at Chester Street.

777
01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:51.717
Erm...

778
01:06:51.717 --> 01:06:53.593
The one that the local ladies
have been petitioning

779
01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:54.928
to turn into a children's playground.

780
01:06:55.137 --> 01:06:56.179
Ah! Now. I believe...

781
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:58.932
Erm. I believe it's. uh...

782
01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:01.268
Yes. sir. I believe
Mr Rusbridger has it.

783
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:05.439
Yes. Mr Rusbridger. you took it off
of Mr Williams' desk last Friday.

784
01:07:05.439 --> 01:07:07.107
the last time the ladies were here.

785
01:07:07.274 --> 01:07:08.900
- Well. Mr Rusbridger.
- Yes. sir. I suppose I did.

786
01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.485
So. it must be here somewhere.

787
01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.487
Mr Wakeling. you say
the ladies have been here again?

788
01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:13.822
- As recently as Friday?
-  Last Friday. sir.

789
01:07:13.989 --> 01:07:15.532
Yes. here it is.

790
01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.325
We have just enough time before lunch.

791
01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:18.785
I propose we go straight away.

792
01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:19.911
Go. sir?

793
01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.788
Mr Rusbridger. we'll will take
the file with us.

794
01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:23.707
but please wrap it up well.
It's pouring outside.

795
01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:26.001
Well. that's just it.
if I may say so. sir.

796
01:07:26.126 --> 01:07:27.836
it is very wet just now.

797
01:07:27.836 --> 01:07:29.546
I'm sure we'll manage. Mr Hart.

798
01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.047
Mrs Johnstone.

799
01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:33.800
We haven't been formally introduced.

800
01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.261
How do you do. Mr Williams?

801
01:07:36.595 --> 01:07:37.721
It's a pleasure to meet you.

802
01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:39.181
The pleasure is all mine.

803
01:07:39.181 --> 01:07:42.684
Mrs Johnstone. would you mind terribly
remaining here and holding the fort?

804
01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:45.187
- Certainly. sir.
- Thank you.

805
01:07:45.479 --> 01:07:48.648
Messrs Middleton. Hart. Rusbridger.
and Wakeling. if you'd follow me.

806
01:07:48.774 --> 01:07:49.941
Thank you. Mr Singh.

807
01:08:25.227 --> 01:08:26.311
Chester Street.

808
01:08:26.311 --> 01:08:29.272
District Line to Stepney Green
and then a brisk walk.

809
01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:53.899
It was a lovely service.
I think everyone enjoyed it.

810
01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:56.109
Pardon?

811
01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.278
It was a lovely service.
I think everyone enjoyed it.

812
01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.488
Yes. yes. I think so.
I think so. Yes.

813
01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:17.964
Good afternoon. Sir James.

814
01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:20.050
Jolly decent of you to show up.

815
01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.010
Good afternoon. Mr Ryman.

816
01:10:22.594 --> 01:10:24.262
Middleton. sir.

817
01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:26.598
You worked alongside him.

818
01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:28.892
Must be like losing family.

819
01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:33.939
Yes. sir.
It feels almost like that.

820
01:10:34.356 --> 01:10:37.067
I want you to know
how very sorry we all are.

821
01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.110
-  Very good of you. sir.
- Thank you. Sir James.

822
01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:43.239
Look here. Mr...

823
01:10:43.365 --> 01:10:44.866
- Middleton. sir.
- Middleton. quite.

824
01:10:45.367 --> 01:10:48.703
Erm. perhaps. you'd be good enough
to come to my office Monday morning.

825
01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:50.789
We might talk this over.

826
01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:54.084
How best to handle it from here.

827
01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:57.170
Of course. sir.

828
01:10:57.671 --> 01:11:01.716
Naturally. one wants to give credit
where it's due.

829
01:11:03.218 --> 01:11:06.972
But the way those ladies
have been kicking up.

830
01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:09.849
In the end.
it does a disservice

831
01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:12.811
to the memory
of our dear departed friend.

832
01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:15.271
Such a self-effacing fellow.

833
01:11:15.814 --> 01:11:19.067
If he were here.
he'd be the first to protest.

834
01:11:19.234 --> 01:11:20.276
Excuse me.

835
01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:21.903
Miss Harris.

836
01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.490
- Hello. Mr Wakeling.
- Hello.

837
01:11:26.533 --> 01:11:29.119
Erm. I saw you talking
with the ladies.

838
01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:33.289
Yes. they're very distraught.
They were so fond of him.

839
01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:35.792
Yes.

840
01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:37.711
Look. Miss Harris. erm...

841
01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:43.466
Well. I was. I suppose
I was just wondering if. erm...

842
01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:48.221
What were you wondering. Mr Wakeling?

843
01:11:49.347 --> 01:11:50.432
Mr Wakeling.

844
01:11:50.557 --> 01:11:51.599
Mr Williams.

845
01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:55.145
I'm sorry to raise this here.

846
01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.858
But I thought it best
to give this to you right away.

847
01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:00.984
Oh.

848
01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:04.946
It was among my father's things.

849
01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:08.700
Quite prominent.

850
01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.827
He's marked it
"private and confidential'.

851
01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:14.247
So he has.

852
01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:20.462
Miss Harris.

853
01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.381
We haven't been introduced. I know.

854
01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:25.675
but I wonder if we might have
a word in private.

855
01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:27.969
- In private?
- Yes.

856
01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:30.930
- If. if you wouldn't mind.
- Of course.

857
01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:38.438
- Excuse me.
- Not at all.

858
01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:39.731
This way.

859
01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:57.332
Excuse me for bringing you away.

860
01:12:57.499 --> 01:12:59.542
Oh. no. No. not at all.

861
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:03.171
I appreciate you coming today.

862
01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:04.756
Thank you.

863
01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:08.384
I'm awfully sorry.

864
01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:11.262
Must be such a huge loss.

865
01:13:13.181 --> 01:13:14.182
It is rather.

866
01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:19.729
We haven't really been introduced.

867
01:13:19.938 --> 01:13:20.939
No.

868
01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.317
I know that you worked with him.

869
01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:27.487
Yes. well. only briefly.

870
01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:29.447
Margaret Harris.

871
01:13:32.784 --> 01:13:33.952
Miss Harris...

872
01:13:34.786 --> 01:13:36.037
How do you do?

873
01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:37.163
How do you do?

874
01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:41.376
I'm sorry. I should have come
and introduced myself earlier.

875
01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:44.796
- but you seemed so busy and...
- Oh. that's. that's quite alright.

876
01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.303
I really am dreadfully sorry.

877
01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:56.266
This must be so hard for you.

878
01:13:56.474 --> 01:13:57.600
One bears up.

879
01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:02.272
And I've been through
this sort of thing once before.

880
01:14:02.564 --> 01:14:03.773
Oh. yes.

881
01:14:05.233 --> 01:14:06.234
Miss Harris...

882
01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:10.321
there was something
I wished to ask you.

883
01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:11.447
Of course.

884
01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:16.286
There's something I.
I can't quite. erm...

885
01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:24.085
Did my father know he was ill?

886
01:14:28.715 --> 01:14:29.924
That he was dying?

887
01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:41.728
I don't know what...
I don't know what to say.

888
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.740
Because if he knew...

889
01:14:56.576 --> 01:14:58.119
and he told you...

890
01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:02.540
You see what I mean?

891
01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:07.670
Why wouldn't he tell me?

892
01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:09.339
Well...

893
01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:13.551
Perhaps he...

894
01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:17.889
If he'd just told me...

895
01:15:19.349 --> 01:15:21.392
I'd never have let him
leave us like that.

896
01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:24.771
In all that cold.

897
01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.248
I'm sorry.

898
01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.087
Er...

899
01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:54.092
Thank you. Miss Harris.

900
01:16:12.026 --> 01:16:13.278
What's that you've got there?

901
01:16:18.116 --> 01:16:19.200
Nothing.

902
01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.245
I'll read it some other time.

903
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:25.832
Any of you chaps get a chance
to talk to Mrs Smith?

904
01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:27.875
Or any of the other ladies?

905
01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:33.214
You know. one appreciates them
sticking up for the old man's memory.

906
01:16:33.381 --> 01:16:35.341
But they've quite convinced themselves

907
01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:38.511
that Mr Williams built
that playground entirely by himself.

908
01:16:44.726 --> 01:16:46.811
Parks did get more credit
than they deserved.

909
01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:48.771
That's because they're called Parks.

910
01:16:51.691 --> 01:16:53.943
Sir James certainly got his share
of the credit.

911
01:16:55.153 --> 01:16:56.738
Made certain of that.

912
01:16:57.113 --> 01:17:00.158
Sir James was quite crucial
as far as that playground's concerned.

913
01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:06.122
Suppose he was.

914
01:17:08.666 --> 01:17:10.710
You know. I. I can't help thinking.

915
01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:12.879
And I. I didn't know Mr Williams

916
01:17:12.879 --> 01:17:14.964
the way you all did.
of course. but...

917
01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.344
- ...but it does seem to me that he...
- That he changed.

918
01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:22.513
Yes.

919
01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:25.767
It was this playground business.

920
01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:28.561
Chester Street.

921
01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:30.855
District Line to Stepney Green
and then a brisk walk.

922
01:17:54.754 --> 01:17:56.005
No. you must...

923
01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:57.465
No. I insist. sir.

924
01:17:57.882 --> 01:17:59.050
Honestly.

925
01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:13.940
He was willing to traipse
through all that sewage water

926
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.650
- just to get to the site.
-  He did become...

927
01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:17.527
obsessed.

928
01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:20.530
He was prepared to make himself
a right bugger about it.

929
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.532
I accompanied him once to Planning.

930
01:18:22.532 --> 01:18:23.616
This is it here.

931
01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.410
Leave it with us and we'll send it
down to you once it's ready.

932
01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:28.162
That ogre Talbot
was presiding that day.

933
01:18:28.162 --> 01:18:30.415
Actually. I was hoping
you might see to it now.

934
01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.667
and then I could take it
off your hands straight away.

935
01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:36.671
Well. I'm unable to authorise it
just like that.

936
01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:38.506
Look. look. don't worry.

937
01:18:38.506 --> 01:18:40.258
I'll see it gets done.
We'll send it down to you.

938
01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:45.513
Why don't I wait here
while you check those entries?

939
01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:51.185
Well. it's up to you. but you might
find yourself waiting for some time.

940
01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:52.562
We've got a lot on up here.

941
01:18:52.562 --> 01:18:55.606
Take all the time you need. Mr Talbot.
I'm quite happy here.

942
01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:58.526
Mr Hart. you'd better get back.

943
01:18:59.402 --> 01:19:01.612
Tell the others I've been held up.

944
01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.906
Indefinitely.

945
01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:06.576
Of course. Mr Williams.

946
01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:15.668
He said he'd sit and wait
all day if he had to.

947
01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:17.670
And he did.

948
01:19:23.718 --> 01:19:25.887
This is very good of you. Mr Jones.

949
01:19:26.179 --> 01:19:30.475
I know we're placing an extra burden
on all of you here.

950
01:19:30.475 --> 01:19:32.852
So. this is what?
A kiddies' playground?

951
01:19:32.852 --> 01:19:33.936
Yes.

952
01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:35.146
Urgent?

953
01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:37.732
We'd appreciate
your giving it priority.

954
01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:41.360
Well. if you request it. Mr Williams.

955
01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:43.488
Thank you. Mr Jones.

956
01:19:48.075 --> 01:19:50.328
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

957
01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:58.002
Instead of just leaving...

958
01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:01.797
he went over
to each of them in turn...

959
01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:03.674
Thank you.

960
01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.843
...looked them in the face...

961
01:20:07.512 --> 01:20:08.763
Thank you.

962
01:20:08.888 --> 01:20:10.473
...and thanked them all.

963
01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:12.350
Thank you.

964
01:20:12.517 --> 01:20:13.851
Yes. of course. Anything.

965
01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:15.144
I appreciate it.

966
01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:17.188
Thank you.

967
01:20:17.355 --> 01:20:18.564
That's quite alright. sir.

968
01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:23.027
Everyone.

969
01:20:25.238 --> 01:20:28.032
Parks did then rather pull out
the stops. didn't they?

970
01:20:28.032 --> 01:20:29.116
Quite.

971
01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:31.911
The Mr Williams of a year ago

972
01:20:31.911 --> 01:20:33.746
would never thought
of doing something like that.

973
01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:45.883
Actually. I witnessed something
even more remarkable.

974
01:20:46.217 --> 01:20:49.428
I never told you chaps
at the time because...

975
01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:52.848
Well. it rather annoyed me.

976
01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:55.101
So. you see.
for all these reasons.

977
01:20:55.226 --> 01:20:57.061
this isn't something
we can contemplate

978
01:20:57.061 --> 01:20:58.813
for the foreseeable future.

979
01:20:59.146 --> 01:21:02.108
I'm sorry. I genuinely regret it.

980
01:21:02.108 --> 01:21:04.151
We'd gone
up to Sir James' office

981
01:21:04.151 --> 01:21:06.320
to plead a case for the playground.

982
01:21:06.571 --> 01:21:09.448
and Sir James rejected it.

983
01:21:09.574 --> 01:21:11.909
And the site is a disgrace.

984
01:21:13.327 --> 01:21:16.872
Unfortunately. just now.
we have even more urgent priorities.

985
01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:21.502
Well. thank you
for coming to see me.

986
01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:27.133
They're considering Anderson.
for the new editor's post at Punch.

987
01:21:28.175 --> 01:21:30.177
I don't fancy that. do you?

988
01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:31.762
Wouldn't be quite right.

989
01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:33.514
Man's obsessed with the ballet.

990
01:21:33.848 --> 01:21:36.267
Well. that's not entirely fair.

991
01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:38.853
Anderson also cares passionately

992
01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:42.356
about detective fiction and horses.

993
01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:46.068
Sir James...

994
01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:48.487
...please excuse me.

995
01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:52.325
but I beg you to reconsider.

996
01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:54.452
I beg you.

997
01:21:55.995 --> 01:22:00.583
Or. at least... keep the application
open for one more week.

998
01:22:01.584 --> 01:22:03.502
What harm can that do?

999
01:22:04.295 --> 01:22:05.504
He begged him.

1000
01:22:06.339 --> 01:22:09.467
He begged him to reconsider.

1001
01:22:09.717 --> 01:22:11.552
And he wouldn't take no for an answer.

1002
01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:13.220
But it came off.

1003
01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:14.805
What. what's that?

1004
01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:16.140
It came off.

1005
01:22:17.183 --> 01:22:19.977
It must have done.
The Chairman did reconsider.

1006
01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:22.438
Well. yes.

1007
01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:25.691
Yes. I suppose he did.

1008
01:22:26.025 --> 01:22:28.110
Those ladies may have a point.

1009
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.780
Well. yes. but we all put
our shoulders to it.

1010
01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.490
Yes. but...

1011
01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.284
there's no denying
the old man did push it.

1012
01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:40.998
Could it be he knew?

1013
01:22:41.749 --> 01:22:43.084
That he didn't have long?

1014
01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:44.919
Knowing something like that.

1015
01:22:44.919 --> 01:22:48.547
I suppose that might...
galvanise a person.

1016
01:22:48.673 --> 01:22:51.592
Yeah. but he didn't know.
His. his son was very clear on that.

1017
01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.803
I'm pretty sure that's right.

1018
01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:16.826
I think he did know.

1019
01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:28.963
Ladies.

1020
01:23:30.423 --> 01:23:32.466
We mustn't be discouraged.

1021
01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:35.678
There will be a way around this.

1022
01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:38.139
I assure you.

1023
01:23:39.223 --> 01:23:41.434
I don't know how you kept
your temper just now. sir.

1024
01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:47.648
I don't have time
to get angry. Mrs Smith.

1025
01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:50.109
Something in the way
he said it.

1026
01:23:50.109 --> 01:23:51.360
Ladies.

1027
01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:05.541
Well. perhaps we'd all do the same.
All of us here.

1028
01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:09.378
We'd work with extra urgency
in a situation like that.

1029
01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:10.588
Would we?

1030
01:24:10.713 --> 01:24:12.298
It's a natural reaction.

1031
01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:14.759
Well. I don't know.

1032
01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:16.927
I don't think everyone.

1033
01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:19.597
we here. even.

1034
01:24:20.598 --> 01:24:24.560
would necessarily have responded
in quite the way Mr Williams did.

1035
01:24:26.145 --> 01:24:27.438
I agree.

1036
01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:31.734
Hm.

1037
01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:35.154
If he knew...

1038
01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:39.658
he did an awfully good job
keeping it to himself.

1039
01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:28.833
It was almost like he...

1040
01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:40.052
Yeah.

1041
01:25:41.554 --> 01:25:42.555
You're right.

1042
01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:46.600
He certainly set an example for us.

1043
01:25:53.691 --> 01:25:54.817
Look here. everyone.

1044
01:25:58.571 --> 01:26:03.868
Let me propose that we all make
a pledge. here. today.

1045
01:26:05.494 --> 01:26:09.498
Let's pledge to learn
from his example.

1046
01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:13.085
This lesson he set before us.

1047
01:26:13.586 --> 01:26:18.883
Let's vow never again to shy away
from our responsibilities.

1048
01:26:20.426 --> 01:26:24.430
Never again to push things
under the carpet. Or upstairs.

1049
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:26.599
Mr Williams has shown us...

1050
01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:29.059
Well. that if...

1051
01:26:30.728 --> 01:26:32.229
If we put our minds to it...

1052
01:26:32.396 --> 01:26:35.399
our backs into it.
we can do even better.

1053
01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:36.483
That's right.

1054
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:38.736
And let me say this here today.

1055
01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:41.614
while I remain
in charge of Public Works.

1056
01:26:41.614 --> 01:26:44.199
we're going to be true
to Mr Williams' memory.

1057
01:26:45.326 --> 01:26:47.286
We're going to get things done.

1058
01:26:47.286 --> 01:26:48.454
- That's right.
- Hear. Hear.

1059
01:27:08.599 --> 01:27:10.559
Reasonably brief. if you don't mind.

1060
01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:13.228
- I'm expecting my nephew to call.
- Of course!

1061
01:27:14.104 --> 01:27:15.314

Education insist this is for us. sir.

1083
01:28:33.434 --> 01:28:34.768
And which one is this?

1084
01:28:34.977 --> 01:28:38.105
The disagreement
concerning the proposed prefabs

1085
01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:40.774

in Shoreditch. sir.

1086
01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:41.942
Ah. that.

1087
01:28:42.693 --> 01:28:43.777
Mr Hart.

1088
01:28:44.028 --> 01:28:46.572
Can you look into Saint Mary's School?

1089
01:28:46.572 --> 01:28:48.407
That's for Education. Mr Middleton.

1090
01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:49.533
It's a Schools matter.

1091
01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:52.995
Even so. sir.
Education insist...

1092
01:28:54.621 --> 01:28:55.664
Well...

1093
01:28:57.624 --> 01:28:59.877
we can keep it here for now.

1094
01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:04.298
No harm.

1095
01:29:08.302 --> 01:29:09.845
The postal run. please.

1096
01:29:13.474 --> 01:29:15.100
Mr Middleton.

1097
01:29:17.436 --> 01:29:18.812
Yes. Mr Wakeling.

1098
01:29:35.913 --> 01:29:38.373
I'd like this in triplicate.
please. Mrs Johnstone.

1099
01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:42.544
That'll be all. thank you. Mr Singh.

1100
01:30:04.566 --> 01:30:06.568
I wonder. Mr Wakeling.

1101
01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:12.366
if I may now turn to matters
you may consider more personal.

1102
01:30:13.951 --> 01:30:17.162
I have no wish
to belittle our playground...

1103
01:30:17.788 --> 01:30:21.166
but I put it to you that it was.
all the same...

1104
01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:22.793
a small thing.

1105
01:30:23.293 --> 01:30:26.213
And that it will. before long...

1106
01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.882
go the way of most small things.

1107
01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:33.846
It may fall into disrepair.

1108
01:30:34.012 --> 01:30:37.975
or be superseded
by some grander scheme.

1109
01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:41.270
To speak plainly.

1110
01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:45.899
we cannot assume to have erected
a lasting monument.

1111
01:30:47.985 --> 01:30:51.155
Should there come days
when it's no longer clear to you

1112
01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:54.658
to what end you are directing
your daily efforts.

1113
01:30:55.576 --> 01:30:59.037
when the sheer grind of it all
threatens to reduce you

1114
01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:03.292
to the kind of state
in which I so long existed...

1115
01:31:11.341 --> 01:31:15.721
I urge you then to recall
our little playground.

1116
01:31:16.263 --> 01:31:18.348
and the modest satisfaction

1117
01:31:18.348 --> 01:31:21.560
that became our due
upon its completion.

1118
01:31:41.622 --> 01:31:42.789
Evening. sir.

1119
01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:45.709
Good evening. Officer.

1120
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:48.921
Everything alright?

1121
01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:51.131
Yes.

1122
01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:53.342
I just wanted to see
this playground again.

1123
01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.598
I. I played a. a small part.

1124
01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:03.060
just a small part. mind you.
in bringing it into being.

1125
01:32:03.352 --> 01:32:04.937
I work at the LCC.

1126
01:32:05.896 --> 01:32:07.231
Is that so. sir?

1127
01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:10.567
Well. then the people here
have a lot to thank you for.

1128
01:32:10.567 --> 01:32:11.860
Oh. I didn't do much.

1129
01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:13.153
The man who did...

1130
01:32:15.405 --> 01:32:17.866
the man. the man who did
passed away this winter.

1131
01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:19.952
Mr Williams.

1132
01:32:22.162 --> 01:32:23.205
Mr Williams.

1133
01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:25.207
Yes.

1134
01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:29.795
He'll be remembered round here with...

1135
01:32:31.797 --> 01:32:33.173
respect and affection.

1136
01:32:34.675 --> 01:32:37.886
I never actually had the honour
of meeting Mr Williams personally.

1137
01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:40.013
He was always that busy.

1138
01:32:43.016 --> 01:32:44.059
If you was his...

1139
01:32:45.018 --> 01:32:47.771
friend. sir. then perhaps
you wouldn't mind my telling you this.

1140
01:32:48.272 --> 01:32:50.357
You know. Station Sergeant
says I'm being foolish.

1141
01:32:50.482 --> 01:32:51.608
But. er...

1142
01:32:52.359 --> 01:32:53.652
it stays on me mind.

1143
01:32:54.027 --> 01:32:55.112

Told him to get out of the cold.

1160
01:34:27.162 --> 01:34:28.955
But. you see. sir. he looked so...

1161

So happy.

1162

disturb him.

1164
01:34:39.883 --> 01:34:42.928
I imagined. in time. he'd just come
off that swing and go home.

Mr Williams had. erm...

1166
01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:55.440
had a terminal illness. you see.

1167
01:34:56.983 --> 01:34:59.403
And I think it was right...

1168
01:35:00.529 --> 01:35:02.489
that you allowed him that moment.

1169
01:35:06.535 --> 01:35:08.286
And I think you're quite right.

1170
01:35:09.246 --> 01:35:12.374
He was happy when you saw him.

01:35:14.501 --> 01:35:17.671
Perhaps as happy as he'd ever been
