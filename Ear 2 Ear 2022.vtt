Do you have another form of payment

I billed you enough already.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:23.002
to the private pharmacy. please?

60
00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:26.206
- Okay. so I didn't add the private pharmacy fee.

61
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.541
That's gonna be another 499.

62
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.751
- For the private pharmacy. Bill me for this appointment.

63
00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:42.355
- Okay. you do know it all goes to her. right?

64
00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.958
Just making sure. making sure.

65
00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.926
Okay. your meds will be delivered today

67
00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.597
- Thank you. Amina.

68
00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:00.607
- You didn't charge her a shipping fee.

69
00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:05.078
Don't look at me like that. I'm over her sob stories.

70
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.146
- That is your sister. Dr. Davis.

71
00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:09.449
- I know. Can you stop reminding me?

72
00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.650
Please? - You know. it is still

73
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.553
your job to show some compassion.

74
00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:15.855
But you a whole ass virgin. so until you have sex.

75
00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.423
you will never understand.

76
00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:20.493
- First off. watch your language.

77
00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:23.129
And don't use my virginity to pity her stupidity.

78
00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.265
She's a living example of why I'm still a virgin.

79
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.033
- Oh my God!

80
00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.402
You act like she was out here thotting around or something.

81
00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.704
Her first boyfriend gave her herpes.

82
00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:35.441
You ever thought maybe she just didn't wanna pass it on?

83
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.745
- Amina. 90% of the world has herpes.

84
00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:41.014
That's no excuse to continue to lay with the same guy

85
00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:44.050
who gave it to you. amongst multiple other things.

86
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.351
I would never be compassionate about things

87
00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.987
that doesn't make sense to me.

88
00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:51.891
But you know what? You persuaded me to care.

89
00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:54.861
It's actually the most challenging task you've done all day.

90
00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:57.096
Unfortunately. I'm just not convinced.

91
00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.164
Do some work!

92
00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:04.370

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.273
- Is it Candace's? - Man. hell nah!

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:41.874

I have chlamydia again.

114
00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:53.953
So you fucking somebody!

115
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:56.856
- Babe. listen. I swear to God

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:02.395
So she done.

Y'all are over because she's done?

126
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:16.275
Well. guess what Terrance?

127
00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:17.510
We have more than one thing in common.

128
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.278
because I'm done too.

129
00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:21.347

130
00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:25.885
Listen. you stay. I'll go.

But shit. babe. You really wanna leave all this?

132
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.563
- I don't want it. T. You can have it all.

133
00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.467
All I've ever done was be good to you.

134
00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:46.072
For you. And you dragged me through the mud every time.

135
00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:50.777
I almost died having our son.

136
00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:54.947
and you was laid up outta town with another bitch.

137
00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:57.917
When you gave me this ring.

138
00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:01.254
you swore it was all about me and baby T.

139
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.424
But Candace was pregnant.

140
00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:08.461
You asked me to be your wife.

141
00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:11.798
You're not ready. T.

142
00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.634
and I'm not waiting no more.

You know I love you. right?

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:42.982
This better be good.

171
00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:46.152
- Hey. you talk to mama or Tameka?

172
00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:48.321

173
00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:51.824

174
00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:54.827
Tameka told her that I gave her something.

175
00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:57.630
Not only that. your mama missing and so is $800

176
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.599

177

- Listen. Look. she always threatens to leave.

178
00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:06.439
Just buy something nice. She'll be fine.

179
00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.273

180
00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:12.511

183
00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:23.789
- [Tameka] Extremely long.

184
00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.391
- Yeah. mine's too.

185
00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:29.261
Why are you ignoring T?

186
00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:30.663
- He's calling about Angel.

187
00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:33.265
She had an appointment with me today.

188
00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:34.734
- Yeah?

189
00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:35.534
Okay.

190
00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:39.338
- Okay. and HIPAA is real.

191
00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:42.508
He needs to start wearing condoms. and that's just that.

192
00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:45.411
- I agree. but who are we to judge?

193
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.849
- Okay Reverend Drew.

194
00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:53.719
he's the reason I started the private pharmacy.

195
00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:58.691
- No. come on.

196
00:10:58.691 --> 00:10:59.925
Lord. please...

197
00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:02.728
What?

198
00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:06.766
- Praying is basically talking to yourself.

199
00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:09.201
You don't need me for that.

200
00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:10.036
- What?

201
00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:14.674
- Hold on. T.

202
00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:15.508
Look.

203
00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:21.380
you're so wounded with no scars.

204
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.182
and that could be considered arrogant.

205
00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:24.517
- Then so be it!

206
00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:29.588
Everything I prayed for. I had to build it myself.

207
00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:31.891
- Here you go. - I'm my own God. Andrew.

208
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.325
- What?

209
00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:35.828
- And you know. since you're so holy and spiritual.

210
00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:38.364
you don't need this. - Hold on. look...

211
00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:42.668
- While you're praying. ask God for a cure for cancer.

212
00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:45.771
Yeah. ask him where COVID came from.

213
00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:46.605
- COVID? - You think he has

214
00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:48.140
a cure for that?

215
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.445
Because if so. we can make about $5 billion this year.

216
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.049
♪ And we're doing this right

217
00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.418

Don't get it twisted. though. That's a cold ass bitch. bro.

But I'd never trust her.

See how as she plays. Shorty.

251
00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:11.390

Loving in a dirty drawer. you know what I'm saying?

Did Ace ever get back to you on that one chick?

- Hell no. bro.

278
00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:58.470
But that's who killed Shorty. though.

279
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.105
Man. girl got so emotion.

He be fucking with my home girl.

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:30.336
But speaking of the devil. that's him at the bar.

292
00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:37.076
- They even asked me to have a threesome with them.

Talking about her friend.

328
00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:54.119
That bitch probably did that for free.

329
00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:55.020
By herself.

330
00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:58.223
She been hating you since high school.

332
00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:00.326

I missed you. what's going on?

340
00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:33.258
Man. how long you gonna be mad about the same old shit?

341
00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:36.729
Listen. I'm sorry about the abortion.

342
00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:38.697
Never gonna have to do that shit again.

343
00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:43.035
Never. But I'm not leaving my family. you know that.

344
00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.940
- I deserve so much more. Terrance.

345
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.442
You go to jail. expect me to post bail.

346
00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:52.211
then send another bitch to bring me some money

347
00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:53.679
and then propose to Angel the same day

348
00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.614
you asked me to get an abortion?

349
00:16:55.614 --> 00:16:56.982
- I gave you 10 fucking thousand dollars

350
00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:59.251
before I got locked up.

351
00:16:59.251 --> 00:17:00.786
And here you go again. like always.

352
00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:03.589
worried about some shit that don't concern you.

353
00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:06.225
I told your ass to get on birth control.

354
00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:09.194
but you lied about that shit too. didn't you?

355
00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:10.029
That it.

356
00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:18.737
- [Eddie] Hey nigga.

357
00:17:18.737 --> 00:17:19.938
The fuck was this bitch crying for. bro?

358
00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:21.473

He died yesterday.

453
00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:29.254
- Police interrogating the only witness right now.

454
00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:30.689
- And who is she?

455
00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:33.158

So please. we really just need to get to the bottom of this.

458
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.365

Can somebody please elaborate?

462
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.506
- She probably did it.

463
00:21:47.506 --> 00:21:48.874
She wants my life so bad.

464
00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:50.609
but she would never accept the fact

465
00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.377
that Terrance would never.

466
00:21:52.377 --> 00:21:53.845
- You gotta chill the fuck out.

467
00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:55.747
I told you that Terrance was at the bar with me.

468
00:21:55.747 --> 00:21:56.815
She just happened to be there.

469
00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:58.150

476
00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:07.693
- Everybody in this room loves Terrance enough

477
00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:09.561
not to kill him.

478
00:22:09.561 --> 00:22:12.230
- And your way of thinking is why you never win cases.

479
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.266
The people that love you will kill you. Tammy.

480
00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:15.834
How the hell did you make it through law school?

481

Enough!

483
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.838
Back to him leaving the scene.

484
00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:21.306
- Okay. okay.

485
00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:22.808
Stop. okay?

486
00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:25.477
I know you want a lead. and I want one just as bad as you.

487

(Tammy and Eddie moaning)

554
00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:15.607
- Shit.

555
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:21.046
Oh shit.

556
00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:23.648
- Tammy.

557
00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:26.418
Tammy.

558
00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:36.494
This nigga Terrance. man.

559
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:41.533
Nigga just had so many bodies on his gun.

560
00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:43.935
Hell. I did too.

561
00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:47.939
Them fucking guns couldn't have been on the scene

562
00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:50.108
when the police got there.

563
00:26:51.242 --> 00:26:53.311
or I'd be doing double life or some shit.

564
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:54.245
I'm looking over my shoulder

565
00:26:54.245 --> 00:26:56.815
for the rest of my fucking life.

566
00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:59.651
- I want to believe you.

567
00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:01.620
I really do.

568
00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:08.693
But trusting you has never worked for me.

569
00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:12.097
Remember? (phone ringing)

570
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:15.133
Shit.

571
00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:17.035
Good morning.

572
00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:21.306
Okay.

573
00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:26.211
I'll be leaving in about 45 minutes. I'll call you back.

574
00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:27.045
Hold on.

575
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.983
Oh shit.

576
00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:42.093
I gotta go to work.

577
00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:52.404
You good?

578
00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:04.582
- [Tameka] Good morning.

579
00:28:04.582 --> 00:28:06.117
- Is it?

580
00:28:06.117 --> 00:28:09.320
You're booked all day. back to back until four o'clock.

581
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.058
- I wonder what genius would do such a thing.

582
00:28:20.231 --> 00:28:21.566
- [Amina] You gonna really sit there and read that card

583
00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:25.070
like you don't know who is from.

584
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.205
- You talk so much in the morning. I notice.

585
00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:28.973
Where's my coffee?

586
00:28:28.973 --> 00:28:32.577
- So about that. your coffee plucky said he's done.

587
00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:34.579
You don't respond to his calls or his texts.

588
00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:36.147
or answer his emails.

589
00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:39.784
You act like that boy does not exist.

590
00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:42.420
- So let me just get this straight.

591
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.857
You overbook me. The coffee guy is moody.

592
00:28:47.258 --> 00:28:50.595
This is gonna be a very interesting day.

593
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.798
- [Shaquita] Hey.

594
00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:56.801
- Hi. can you sign in for me please?

595
00:29:06.544 --> 00:29:09.714
Okay. Shaquita. room five in the back.

596
00:29:14.686 --> 00:29:16.254
- I know. just...

597
00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:17.489
- She gonna make me fuck her up.

598
00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:19.023
- I know. but just don't be ghetto.

599
00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:21.760
Just go do your job. please.

600
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.861
- I'm trying!

601
00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:41.112
Okay. so I'm just here to check your vitals

602
00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:42.313
if you can go ahead and sit on the bed.

603
00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:43.515
- Nah. I ain't here for all that.

604
00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:46.017
I just gotta get some birth control.

605
00:29:46.017 --> 00:29:49.621
- Lord. she got more time and I'm gonna cut flat on her ass.

606
00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.689
Can you go ahead and sit on the bed for me?

607
00:29:51.689 --> 00:29:52.524
- No.

608
00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:55.627
- Hi. I'm Krystal Berry.

609
00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:57.262
I have a 9:30 appointment with Dr. Davis.

610
00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:58.763
- Hi Krystal. here's the iPad.

611
00:29:58.763 --> 00:30:03.434
Fill out the prompts and the nurse will be right with you.

612
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.571
The drop station.

613
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:22.387
She'll be pregnant tomorrow.

614
00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:23.555
Krystal Berry?

615
00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:28.693
I am Dr. Davis. I will be taking your pap today.

616
00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:33.865
Scoot to the edge for me. please. and open up.

617
00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:42.240
Krystal. when is the last time you had a pap smear?

618
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.475
- It's been a few years. Why. what's wrong?

619
00:30:44.475 --> 00:30:48.913
- Just relax. I'm just getting cultures right now.

620
00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:52.317
Okay. go ahead and sit up for me. please.

621
00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:57.422
From the looks of it. you for sure have an STD.

622
00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:59.490
You're very irritated down here.

623
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.559
How often are you having unprotected sex?

624
00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:03.528
- A lot. but only with my boyfriend.

625
00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.330
I haven't had sex with anyone since high school.

626
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:06.931
and I wore condoms.

627
00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:10.101
Oh my God. he's cheating.

628
00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.905
- Listen. I see this every day.

629
00:31:13.905 --> 00:31:16.608
My advice to you is to still wear condoms.

630
00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:19.143
even in a relationship.

631
00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:21.212
So I'm gonna treat you for the common STDs today

632
00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:22.547
to save you some time.

633
00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:24.148
If anything comes back from your cultures

634
00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:25.917
other than what I treated you for.

635
00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:27.952
I will definitely contact you.

636
00:31:27.952 --> 00:31:30.622
Amina's gonna get some blood work and a urine sample.

637
00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:32.590
- Thank you. Dr. Davis.

638
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.658
- No problem.

639
00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:36.761
- Eddie did it! He's guilty. Tammy.

640
00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:38.029
Read this shit!

641
00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:42.667
- My mother failed to mention this.

642
00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.903
- She didn't have to. That's PJ.

643
00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:46.804
Neighborhood runner for Big Loke.

644
00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:49.874
I brought him in for questioning. but he has an alibi.

645
00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:52.744
He was at home with his wife when the killing took place.

646
00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:54.312
- Says who? His wife?

647
00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:57.015
Who wouldn't lie to save her husband?

648
00:31:57.015 --> 00:32:01.319
Anyway. what did you find out about Candace?

649
00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.955
- Well. she's pregnant. I'm not sure if it's your brother's.

650
00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:05.223
but she's definitely with child.

651
00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:07.325
- Fucking course she's pregnant.

652
00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:10.228
- The two girls are Brittany Johnson and Jaynaye Foster.

653
00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:11.930
Brittany is Candace's best friend.

654
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.898
and Jaynaye is a long distance friend of Brittany's

655
00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:15.566
who was there for the weekend.

656
00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:17.635
I questioned Brittany for about two hours.

657
00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:20.038
I discovered that Candace is suicidal.

658
00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:21.639
Her mother isn't supportive.

659
00:32:21.639 --> 00:32:23.107
and your brother was under the impression

660
00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:25.910
that she had an abortion.

661
00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.646
Your brother supposedly paid Brittany to leave

662
00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:31.249
so he and Candace could talk alone in private.

663
00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:34.852
That was before the killing took place.

664
00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:36.421
- And what about the Jaynaye chick?

665
00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:38.256
- Born and raised in Chicago.

666
00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:41.492
Her and Brittany met in college. Wayne State University.

667
00:32:41.492 --> 00:32:43.027
- And Candace and Jaynaye?

668
00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:45.196
- Just mutual friends through Brittany.

669
00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:46.965
- How are you so sure?

670
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:48.466
- Facebook.

671
00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:49.767
Everything that you need to solve a crime is on Facebook.

672
00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:51.169
- Of course. Facebook.

673
00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:54.405
- This generation makes me love my job.

674
00:32:57.976 --> 00:33:00.645
(Tameka moaning)

675
00:33:10.621 --> 00:33:14.459
(phone ringing and vibrating)

676
00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:17.729
- The fuck?

677
00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:21.566
(phone ringing and vibrating)

678
00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:31.275
(doorbell ringing)

679
00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:37.382
- What?

680
00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:38.783
- Don't do all that when I come over here.

681
00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:40.351
- Why are you over here?

682
00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:44.088
- Tameka. I know you wasn't here asking.

683
00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:45.723
That is beyond pathetic.

684
00:33:45.723 --> 00:33:48.059
At this point. you might want to sleep with Drew.

685
00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:49.394
- I don't want Drew.

686
00:33:49.394 --> 00:33:51.029
Why are you popping up at my house unannounced.

687
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:53.164
and what the hell do you have on?

688
00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:57.101
- First of all. bitch. you could never.

689
00:33:57.101 --> 00:33:59.337
And it's ladies' night at that new bar on 14th street.

690
00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:00.638
And since you don't want Drew.

691
00:34:00.638 --> 00:34:03.508
you might as well come out and mingle!

692
00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:05.810
Or do you wanna be a virgin for the rest of your life?

693
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.246
- Actually. I'm waiting on marriage.

694
00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:09.414
- Waiting? For what?

695
00:34:09.414 --> 00:34:11.816
You don't even believe in God.

696
00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:13.284
- Now that you've ruined my moment.

697
00:34:13.284 --> 00:34:14.485
- Yeah.

698
00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:15.820
- Did you at least- - Where is Drew anyways?

699
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.422
- Still in surgery.

700
00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.856
- Did you at least bring champagne?

701
00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:20.658
- No. It's Friday night.

702
00:34:20.658 --> 00:34:23.294
Drew's gonna be out all night. so we might as well go party.

703
00:34:23.294 --> 00:34:24.495
Come on!

704
00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:25.930
- I think not.

705
00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.732
I'm not going anywhere with you looking like that.

706
00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:29.434
- Uh-uh. don't be shady.

707
00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:31.235
Listen. my cousin Derek said his friend's

708
00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:32.770
new bar is gonna be lit.

709
00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:35.740
So come on. we are going out.

710
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.941
Let's go! - I don't want to.

711
00:34:36.941 --> 00:34:37.775

00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:11.542
- Yeah. what's up. bitch?

731
00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:12.810
Starting fucking talking.

732
00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.946
- Shit. I don't know what this is about!

733
00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:17.181
- Bitch. who killed my brother?

734
00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:18.850
- E! I have no idea!

735
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.486
Shit.

736
00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:23.221
- You ain't know who T was smashing? You raggedy. dusty ass?

737
00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:24.922
'Cause y'all know everything.

738
00:35:24.922 --> 00:35:27.291
Just like I know you put the play on little Shorty.

739
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.327
But oh yeah. before I kill your ass.

740
00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:31.596
you're about to let me into the fucking know.

741
00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:33.097
- Wasn't just sleeping with T.

742
00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:34.532
We've been a thing. but no one knew!

743
00:35:34.532 --> 00:35:36.767
- When the last time you seen him?

744
00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:38.336
- We met at the mall to grab lunch!

745
00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:39.604
- Who else?

746
00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:41.873
Bitch. what you eat? What mall?

747
00:35:41.873 --> 00:35:43.040
- Alexander's!

748
00:35:43.941 --> 00:35:45.176
T was like my best friend!

749
00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:47.078
We met at the mall. did some shopping.

750
00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:49.547
and T got a bag for his baby mama.

751
00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:50.982
- Let me guess. - Shit.

752
00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:54.986
- You maxed and get your raggedy ass a bag. huh?

753
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.157
- Me and T was getting a different type of bag.

754
00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:04.028
Little bitch ass bag out of a Somerset could never compare.

755
00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:09.433
(footsteps tapping)

756
00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:11.435
- Hi. I'm Tammy Davis.

757
00:36:11.435 --> 00:36:12.803
Are you Shavonne Rivers?

758
00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:14.906
- Yes. what's this concerning?

759
00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:17.441
- I'm working with Officer Walt on that Terrance Davis case.

760
00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:19.577
- Oh. my husband already spoke with him.

761
00:36:19.577 --> 00:36:21.646
I have nothing to say unless a lawyer is present.

762
00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:23.481
- I am a lawyer.

763
00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:26.450
In this. your statement. it says that you were home

764
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.586
with your husband and kids.

765
00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:29.854
However. Mary Brooks Nursing Home

766
00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:32.190
has you on a clock for a full shift?

767
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.125
7:45 p.m. to 7:45 a.m.?

768
00:36:35.793 --> 00:36:38.329
I highly doubt stealing time from a million dollar company.

769
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:39.163
- Look.

770
00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:43.267
- We can handle this in court.

771
00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:45.469
I don't like to waste time. though.

772
00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:49.740
Now. you have the right to testify and you can do that.

773
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.777
But then that's when my job comes into play.

774
00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:54.378
- Is that a threat?

775
00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:59.850
- No. more like an eye opener.

776
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.987
You see. I do know that PJ has three spots.

777
00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:04.222
Yeah.

778
00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:05.456
Two on Turner and in this one here

779
00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:07.925
that you and your kids live in.

780
00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:11.963
So hypothetically speaking. I wouldn't call it a threat.

781
00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:13.631
More like a promise.

782
00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:26.944
(frightening music)

783
00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:29.447
- Terrance was more than a fuck.

784
00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:30.615
We made money.

785
00:37:31.882 --> 00:37:33.384
- How?

786
00:37:33.384 --> 00:37:34.452
Crystal Meth.

787
00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:36.420
I'm Ace.

788
00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:40.291
He told you about Ace. right?

789
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.161
(gunshot firing) - The money!

790
00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:44.996
Huh?

791
00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:47.999
- It wasn't me.

792
00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:49.800
I'm Ace.

793
00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:53.371
Terrance told you Ace killed Shorty?

794
00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:54.939
- Hey brother. that...

795
00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:56.607
That nigga Ace. bro.

796
00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:58.743
did Ace ever get back to you on that one chick?

797
00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:03.080
- Hell no. bro. But that's who killed Shorty. though.

798
00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:08.152
- So then you know I killed Shorty.

799
00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.054
I'm Ace.

800
00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.406
See Terrance wanted to tell you.

801
00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:31.776
but he knew you'd try and kill me.

802
00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:34.445
- Bitch. doesn't give a fuck about you.

803
00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:37.481
T could have had a dozen bitches a day.

804
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:39.850
He would've offed you about Shorty.

805
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.485
- Yeah. no. but see. I'm the money.

806
00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:44.188
- Bitch know how to get to a bag.

807
00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:45.022
- Ace.

808
00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:48.359
See. Terrance would rather have you thinking he was whack

809
00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:52.430
for fucking with Shorty's bitch than to lose Ace.

810
00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:57.668
And the reason y'all operation

811
00:38:57.668 --> 00:39:00.338
been running all these years. nigga.

812
00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:02.073
- I'm talking big bag.

813
00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:05.476
(words echoing)

814
00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:06.310
- Me.

815
00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:08.079
Salute.

816
00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:12.149
(frightening music)

817
00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:18.956
- Hey M!

818
00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:23.527
What is lit up in here?

819
00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:24.862
This is my song!

820
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.499
- Oh stop it. you're so embarrassing.

821
00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:30.101
- Whatever.

822
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:32.103
- This place looks like a basement.

823
00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:33.304
- Here we go.

824
00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:35.706
- And it smells like dirty mop water in here.

825
00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:36.507
- Shut up.

826
00:39:37.908 --> 00:39:38.909
- Bartender!

827
00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:41.846
- Yes.

828
00:39:41.846 --> 00:39:42.947
- Can you please get my friend a drink?

829
00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:43.981
- Yeah. what'd you guys like?

830
00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:45.449
- I think not!

831
00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:46.917
I'm not drinking.

832
00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:49.453
I'm not even staying. this place doesn't even look safe.

833
00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:50.988
- Tameka. - What?

834
00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:53.491
- Sit your ass down. Now. listen. we ain't at work.

835
00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:54.792
so I ain't gonna hold my tongue.

836
00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:59.230
Sit your boujee. horny. lame ass down somewhere.

837
00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.799
- Shit. you gotta loosen up.

838
00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:03.467
I'm gonna come here. You be in the office too much.

839
00:40:03.467 --> 00:40:05.803
I'm gonna need you to chill.

840
00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:12.476
- Oh. that's that doctor chick that was on CIN.

841
00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:15.312
- Shit! - Yeah. she bad. ain't she?

842
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.016
Nigga. did you just hear what I just said?

843
00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:20.684
She's a doctor.

844
00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:21.685
Don't want you.

845
00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:23.587
- The fuck? - Broke ass.

846
00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:25.556
- Oh. now I'm broke. right? - Yeah. yeah. you broke.

847
00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:26.457
- Watch it.

848
00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:27.625
- Yeah. - Keep it 100.

849
00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:28.759
- Peace.

850
00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.094
- 150. - No. $50.

851
00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:33.697
- I want more money than that. - That's how much you pay.

852
00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:35.399
Money or not.

853
00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:38.002
(upbeat music)

854
00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:44.208
(Esson clearing throat)

855
00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:47.311
- Good evening. ladies. Can I buy you a drink?

856
00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.612
- You work here?

857
00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:51.615
- Yeah. you can say that. I own the place.

858
00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:53.584
- You should remodel.

859
00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:55.119
What?

860
00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.288
- [Amina] Oh. look. I'm Amina and this is my girl. Tameka.

861
00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:59.290
- Actually. I'm your boss and it's

862
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:02.226
Doctor- - Doctor Davis. right?

863
00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:05.029
I seen the interview with Mike Adams.

864
00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.530
See?

865
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.364
I'm Esson.

866
00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:12.136
(Mike coughing)

867
00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:14.338
Forgive me. This is my boy. Mike.

868
00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:15.372
Hey ladies. how you doing?

869
00:41:15.372 --> 00:41:18.642
I'm the co-owner here at the bar.

870
00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:20.211
- Not interested.

871
00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:21.512
- Me either. the fuck?

872
00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:23.013
- Talking about not being ass ho.

873
00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.515
- Not being ass ho? Boy. you better get your whack

874
00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:25.716

875
00:41:25.716 --> 00:41:27.585
- Your beard ain't even lined up right. go!

876
00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:28.953
- Well. your glasses not even on!

877
00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:30.788
- [Amina] The fuck? I'ma beat him up.

878
00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:32.223
- This is ghetto. - Knock that whole bar over.

879
00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:33.557
- Forgive me. ladies. - You're being ghetto.

880
00:41:33.557 --> 00:41:35.459
- I apologize for that.

881
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.995
- So. you single?

882
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:43.767
- Yeah. so is your 32 year old gynecologist right here.

883
00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:45.503
- I'm not interested.

884
00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:49.707
- But you will be.

885
00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:53.143
You ladies have a good evening.

886
00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:53.944
- Bye.

887
00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:58.215
- Ooh. he's gorgeous. - Yes he is!

888
00:41:58.215 --> 00:42:00.718
And I gonna tell you right now. you don't fuck him. I will.

889
00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:02.386
You better get up on that. - [Tameka] Amina!

890
00:42:02.386 --> 00:42:05.389
- [Amina] Excuse! Fake-ass co-owner!

891

(door cracking)

892
00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:17.735
- I have even more evidence that Eddie did it.

893
00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:20.771

Now. fuck me before I change my mind.

My sister's a lawyer that thinks she's the fucking DA.

Hey. you know what?

To top it all off. my only friend works for me.

914
00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:23.434
- But you haven't mentioned anything about yourself.

915
00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:24.735
- Oh. this bitch?

916
00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:26.804
She a 32 year-old virgin.

917
00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:29.273

918
00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:31.342
- Would you shut up already? - I'm sorry.

919
00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:32.776
- Supposed to be the only friend.

920
00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:33.877
- Unfortunately.

921
00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:35.245
- Hey look. I apologize.

922
00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:37.648
What happened to your brother?

923
00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:41.385
If you don't mind me asking. what happened?

924
00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:42.853
- I mind.

925
00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:44.588
- My apologies again.

926
00:43:45.856 --> 00:43:47.358
- No biggie.

It's getting late. Amina. come on. let's head out.

928
00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:53.631
We have to be at the office very early.

929

Esson. right?

930
00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:56.133
- Right.

931

- Nice meeting you.

932
00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:58.168
- Dr. Davis.

933
00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:00.671
It's just the beginning.

934
00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.306
- I'm sorry? - Of us.

935
00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:06.410
- Bitch! You is fucking him!

936
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:07.878
Come on! I don't care what you say.

Yo go fuck him! I've said it. oh!

Girl you're gonna be mad!

Whoo!

942
00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:19.456
And you still made it here on time?

943
00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:21.492
Girl. you are not human.

944
00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:22.860
- Good morning. Amina.

945
00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:25.129
Last night was last night.

946
00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:27.164
What time is my first appointment?

947
00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:29.933
You are free until four o'clock.

948
00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:31.735
- Interesting. 'cause I could sworn I seen something

949
00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:33.704
on the board for 1:00.

950
00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:37.474
- Yeah. You have a date with Esson at 1:00.

951
00:44:37.474 --> 00:44:38.709
- What?

952
00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:42.346
- You know. the guy from last night.

953
00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:45.082
- You know I would never!

954
00:44:45.082 --> 00:44:46.650
- Oh. but you will.

955
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.419
You will Dr. Davis. because if you don't.

956
00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:49.987
I have to give back $1.500.

957
00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:51.555
and I already spent 500 on Amazon.

958
00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:52.690
so it ain't no going back.

959
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.391
You're going on this date.

960
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:56.226
- I would never. - 1.500.

961
00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:57.928
- You know I'm not- - 1.500.

962
00:44:57.928 --> 00:44:59.596
- Why would- - 1.500.

963
00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:02.132
- Yeah. - We'll talk about that later.

964
00:45:02.132 --> 00:45:03.734
I will get back to that. but right now.

965
00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:05.836
I need you to call Krystal Berry in.

966
00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:08.238
- Is everything okay?

967
00:45:08.238 --> 00:45:10.974
- These cultures. they're just so confusing.

968
00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:12.776
Did you test these the same day?

969
00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:14.111
- Of course I did.

970
00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:15.546
Why? What does it say?

971
00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:16.380
Is it bad?

972
00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:20.217
- I'm just hoping it's a false read.

973
00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:21.652
Get her in here for some blood work.

974
00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:22.486
- Okay.

975
00:45:32.129 --> 00:45:34.965
(phone ringing)

976
00:45:34.965 --> 00:45:36.300
- Hi. Ms. Berry?

977
00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:38.569
- What's up. Chanel? I'm at work.

978
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:40.170
- Grandma stole my laptop.

979
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.972
- Okay. just calm down. Calm down.

980
00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:43.507
Where's your mother?

981
00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:45.209
- I don't know! She didn't answer when I called her.

982
00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:46.944
And I have to do my homework.

983
00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.912
and my essay is due tomorrow.

984
00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:51.248
- Okay. I'll come over after work and you can use mine.

985
00:45:51.248 --> 00:45:52.683
Is she there now?

986
00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:57.321
Okay.

987
00:45:57.321 --> 00:45:59.156
I'll be there shortly.

988
00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:00.858
The fuck is your mom?

989
00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:05.462
(cars whirring)

990
00:46:05.462 --> 00:46:07.164
- Sorry. make it two. Here she is.

991
00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:09.800
- [Tameka] Champagne. please.

992
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.168
- You're late.

993
00:46:11.168 --> 00:46:12.603
- Late? I'm here.

994
00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:15.339
- You want to be?

995
00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:18.842
You look beautiful.

996
00:46:18.842 --> 00:46:21.912
- I know that. but thank you.

997
00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:23.080
- Here you are. - Thanks.

998
00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.548
- Are you two ready to order?

999
00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:25.883
- Yes. I'll have the garden salad.

1000
00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:26.984
and hold the cheese. please.

1001
00:46:26.984 --> 00:46:28.252
Dressing on the side.

1002
00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:29.119
- [Waitress] Okay. And for you. sir?

1003
00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.220
- I'll have the salmon.

1004
00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.288
- Right away.

1005
00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:36.860
- Vegan. huh?

1006
00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.062
- So what else did you study about me?

1007
00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:40.164
- Everything.

1008
00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:44.301
I know you like red roses. but you love pink.

1009
00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:47.704
and your favorite color is green.

1010
00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:50.207
Red is your second best.

1011
00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:52.943
That's your favorite person. your brother.

1012
00:46:52.943 --> 00:46:54.711
That was your keeper.

1013
00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:57.948
You watch "Make it Make Sense." every Monday.

1014
00:46:57.948 --> 00:47:00.751
and I'm pretty sure it's a mole

1015
00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:03.220
right there under that makeup.

1016
00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:06.590
- Amina. - A lot of your life

1017
00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.358
is your work.

1018
00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:11.094
That's only because you're bored.

1019
00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:14.131
Should I go on?

1020
00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:18.769
- Here you are. - Thank you.

1021
00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:20.304
- I said no cheese!

1022
00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:22.606
- [Waitress] Sorry about that.

1023
00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:23.440
- Sheesh.

1024
00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:29.646
Amina and these freaking dating sites.

1025
00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:32.382
- Nah. I don't bother with those.

1026
00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:34.318
I'm not that pressed.

1027
00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:36.520
I study what I want.

1028
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.788
- Most guys do.

1029
00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:40.824
- That's why you're here.

1030
00:47:40.824 --> 00:47:42.326
I'm not most guys.

1031
00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.665
(door knocking)

1032
00:47:48.665 --> 00:47:49.833
(Poreshanella giggling)

1033
00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:52.502
(door knocking)

1034
00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:55.339
- Who the fuck is banging

1035
00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:57.341
on my mother fucking door like this?

1036
00:47:57.341 --> 00:48:00.043
- [Tameka] Open up this door. you bitch!

1037
00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:02.679
- Bitch! Who do you think you talking to you?

1038
00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:05.115
- You! You stole Chanel's laptop?

1039
00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:07.618
How pathetic are you?

1040
00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:09.553
- Don't come in my house with all of that shit.

1041
00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:11.021
- Your house? You're delusional.

1042
00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:12.522
This isn't your house.

1043
00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:14.625
- Bitch. I brought you in this world. and I will-

1044
00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:17.928
- Can you please stop reminding me?

1045
00:48:17.928 --> 00:48:22.933
You. You are possibly the reason that my brother is dead.

1046
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.635
Right?

1047
00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:26.303
You didn't think I know that he roughed PJ up

1048
00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:28.105
for serving you?

1049
00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:29.806
And then you steal my baby's laptop?

1050
00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.575
You know what?

1051
00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.410
Do me a favor. why don't you just go overdose

1052
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.912
and die already?

1053
00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:37.047
- Auntie! - Chanel. stay out of this.

1054
00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:41.051
You don't know the truth about your grandmother.

1055
00:48:42.219 --> 00:48:45.355
- Chanel is not your daughter. Tameka.

1056
00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:49.426
You're the delusional one.

1057
00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:51.895
You can't have kids.

1058
00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:53.063
- Grandma. stop. - You remember?

1059
00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:53.964
- She's a virgin.

1060
00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:56.466
(tense music)

1061
00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:58.769
- Yeah. - Duh.

1062
00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.138
Hell. I am high!

1063
00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:07.644
But all I ever tried to do was love you. Tameka!

1064
00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:10.347
You're just so damn hard to love!

1065
00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:11.481
- [Chanel] Grandma!

1066
00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:12.916
- No! She's evil!

1067
00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:18.889
I don't know why you hate me so much.

1068
00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:21.158
- You made me this way. Poreshanella.

1069
00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:21.992
- No.

1070
00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:25.963
You was born this way.

1071
00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:28.465
(tense music)

1072
00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:32.903
- The hell is going on here?

1073
00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:37.074
Mom. I know you ain't been getting high I'm my damn house.

1074
00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:39.776
Ma. where you been? I've been trying to call you all day.

1075
00:49:39.776 --> 00:49:41.044
- Hold on. Chanel.

1076
00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:43.046
First of all. this is not your house.

1077
00:49:43.046 --> 00:49:45.515
And while you were somewhere laid on your back.

1078
00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:47.084
your mother sold your daughter's laptop.

1079
00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:48.151
and now she's having a pity party

1080
00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:50.387
because her high is going down.

1081
00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:54.458
- Your father left her this house. so it is her house.

1082
00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:56.626
You're so damn jealous. Tameka.

1083
00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.161
- Of a house?

1084
00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:00.697
My dad put me through med school. and you know what?

1085
00:50:00.697 --> 00:50:02.666
He saved me from you.

1086
00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.901
I can buy plenty of houses.

1087
00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:07.104
He left you nothing.

1088
00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:10.340
- Why is it so easy for you to hate me?

1089
00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:14.277
- I was born this way. remember?

1090
00:50:14.277 --> 00:50:15.112
- And you.

1091
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.515
Okay. you're a slut.

1092
00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:19.449
Great slut.

1093
00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.053
but terrible. terrible mother.

1094
00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:31.061
Bitch. come on! - Mom. stop!

1095
00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:34.398
Come on. Tammy! You're a gangster bitch!

1096
00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:36.967
- Get out. - Gladly.

1097
00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:39.269
- You know what?

1098
00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:43.473
You may not be jealous of the way daddy handled things.

1099
00:50:43.473 --> 00:50:47.711
but you have a very jealous spirit. Tameka.

1100
00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:49.279
You are so hateful!

1101
00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:55.986
And yeah. I may not be mother of the year.

1102
00:50:57.387 --> 00:51:01.625
but until you can have a child. your point is irrelevant.

1103
00:51:04.928 --> 00:51:09.433
- Tammy. you convincing me that you are a good mom

1104
00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:11.468
is like me believing that she would possibly

1105
00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:12.969
one day get clean.

1106
00:51:14.404 --> 00:51:18.875
She's the reason Terrance is dead. Did you even know that?

1107
00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:22.379
- Really wanna breathe.

1108
00:51:29.386 --> 00:51:31.922
Oh my God. This is never-ending.

1109
00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:34.591
(ominous music)

1110
00:51:40.797 --> 00:51:41.965
- Hola.

1111
00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:43.633
- Good morning.

1112
00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:47.971
I don't know who sent these pink ones. They just came.

1113
00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:50.440
- Pink is always better. Cute.

1114
00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:55.011
- Hi. I have an appointment with Dr. Davis.

1115
00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:59.015
- Oh. okay. Go ahead and sign in for me please.

1116
00:51:59.015 --> 00:52:03.920
And you can actually take room five all the way in the back.

1117
00:52:05.288 --> 00:52:07.457
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

1118
00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:15.232
- Oh my God. really?

1119
00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:18.735
- You know her? - Unfortunately.

1120
00:52:25.142 --> 00:52:28.145
(door knocking)

1121
00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:29.679
Candace.

1122
00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:31.815
Good afternoon. Morning.

1123
00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:33.049
Whatever it is.

1124
00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:36.987
- I hate to keep bothering you.

1125
00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:39.623
but you're the best gynecologist in the city.

1126
00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:43.426
and I just want what's best for my baby.

1127
00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:44.694
- [Tameka] Is this the part

1128
00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:47.297
where you tell me it's my brother's?

1129
00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:50.300
- Dr. Davis. her record through from Dr. Matthew's office.

1130
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.369
and Andrew is on line one.

1131
00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:54.304
- Thank you. Take a message. please.

1132
00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:55.105
- Okay.

1133
00:52:57.207 --> 00:52:59.609
- I'll take a DNA test.

1134
00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:02.946
I reached out to your mom and your sister.

1135
00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:06.183
I don't wanna bring any more drama. Tameka.

1136
00:53:06.183 --> 00:53:09.152
- Unfortunately. you are drama. Candace.

1137
00:53:09.152 --> 00:53:11.421
Since my brother's death.

1138
00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:14.024
you've bought nothing but drama to my family.

1139
00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:16.293
but that's personal. right?

1140
00:53:17.727 --> 00:53:20.697
I'm at work and keeping it professional is a must.

1141
00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:21.932
You can sit up.

1142
00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.203
So congratulations. It's a girl.

1143
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:28.205
Her heartbeat is normal. and she's very active.

1144
00:53:28.205 --> 00:53:30.006
- Active. What do you mean?

1145
00:53:30.006 --> 00:53:32.175
- Meaning move around a lot.

1146
00:53:32.175 --> 00:53:36.413
You know. busy body. Like mother. like daughter!

1147
00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:38.715
Amina will be in to get some blood work.

1148
00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:40.917
Oh. and good luck with Poreshanella

1149
00:53:40.917 --> 00:53:43.587
and the whole grandmother thing.

1150
00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:45.755
Have a good day.

1151
00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:57.000
- Hey Dr. Davis. I hope you didn't call me in for bad news.

1152
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:57.968
- For some reason I couldn't get

1153
00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.236
a clear read of your cultures.

1154
00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:00.937
so I'm gonna need some more blood work.

1155
00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:01.771
Follow me.

1156
00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:07.310
- [Amina] Okay. You can follow me out right this way.

1157
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:14.884
- I know that bitch from somewhere.

1158
00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:19.422
- She has like a million followers on social media.

1159
00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:20.624
- I need some prenatal vitamins.

1160
00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:22.525
- Okay. right this way.

1161
00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.196
- I'll get the vitamins.

1162
00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:27.797
Tell her about the private pharmacy. get these to the lab.

1163
00:54:27.797 --> 00:54:29.666
You know it takes forever to get results back.

1164
00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:30.500
Go. - Okay.

1165
00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:48.118
- Good luck!

1166
00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:50.620
(tense music)

1167
00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:05.402
- Hey Dr. Davis. did you...

1168
00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:08.938
Oh my God. Are those Krystal's?

1169
00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:11.007
- Candace.

1170
00:55:12.208 --> 00:55:13.910
- The pregnant chick?

1171
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:17.480
But she didn't ask for a HIV test.

1172
00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.116
Dr. Davis. - It's my brother's. Amina.

1173
00:55:20.116 --> 00:55:22.786
- So you tested her? For what?

1174
00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:24.721
- Listen. my brother is dead.

1175
00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:25.955
My mother's a crack head.

1176
00:55:25.955 --> 00:55:29.659
and Tammy can barely be a mother to Chanel.

1177
00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:33.363
So that leaves me. and I'll give her abortion myself

1178
00:55:33.363 --> 00:55:37.534
before I let her pin a sick. unhealthy baby on me.

1179
00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:41.338
Go ahead and leave for today.

1180
00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:44.574
- I'll leave. Make sure you call Andrew ASAP.

1181
00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:46.343
He said he has a surprise for you.

1182
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:48.845
(tense music)

1183
00:55:59.289 --> 00:56:01.291
- [Andrew] Sorry Davis. had three surgeries.

1184
00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:02.625
but let's have dinner soon.

1185
00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:04.461
I would love to see you before the convention.

1186
00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:05.295
Drew.

1187
00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:11.167
(Tameka sighing)

1188
00:56:19.943 --> 00:56:21.878
- Thanks for breakfast.

1189
00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:23.279
- You know what?

1190
00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:25.515
I'm gonna need you to do that all the time.

1191
00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:26.583
- What's that?

1192
00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:28.184
- Smile.

1193
00:56:28.184 --> 00:56:29.018
I love it.

1194
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.355
And speaking of time.

1195
00:56:32.355 --> 00:56:35.558
I'm definitely gonna be needing more of yours.

1196
00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:37.761
- You know I work a whole lot.

1197
00:56:37.761 --> 00:56:40.563
and I'm technically not dating at the moment.

1198
00:56:40.563 --> 00:56:42.832
So.... - But realistically.

1199
00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:47.837
we are dating. and technically this will be our second date.

1200
00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:51.441
- Time flies when you're having fun.

1201
00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:55.445
- So look. this whole fantasy life that you live in.

1202
00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:59.115
is it just a fantasy. or is this really you?

1203
00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:03.086
- My life is a fairytale to you?

1204
00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:06.823
I'm a good catch. I just don't wanna be caught.

1205
00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:10.527
Look. I work a whole lot and I got so many personal things

1206
00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:11.795
going on in my life right now.

1207
00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:13.797
(Esson shushing)

1208
00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:15.565
- Listen. I want you.

1209
00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:20.170
I do. Fantasies. the fairytale and all.

1210
00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:24.774
Even the flaws. I'll take it.

1211
00:57:24.774 --> 00:57:26.609
- I need to get back to the office.

1212
00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:27.610
- Of course.

1213
00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:33.650
- Hey Amina.

1214
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:34.617
- Hey! - Where's T at?

1215
00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:36.186
Where's T? I'm hungry.

1216
00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:37.787
Just had a surgery. man. About to head back

1217
00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:39.122
to the hospital in about- - You are so silly-

1218
00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:40.356
- 45 minutes.

1219
00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:42.025
- She's actually right behind you.

1220
00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:44.093
- It was everywhere. like...

1221
00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:45.028
- Hey babe.

1222
00:57:46.262 --> 00:57:47.096
- Drew.

1223
00:57:48.164 --> 00:57:50.500
- Got you some more flowers.

1224
00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:56.806
- Drew. this is Esson. Esson. this is Andrew.

1225
00:57:57.774 --> 00:57:58.641
- Okay.

1226
00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:00.443
- Hey Esson!

1227
00:58:00.443 --> 00:58:02.712
- What's up? Hey. what's up?

1228
00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.749
- Yeah. so. was thinking.

1229
00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:08.151
you going to lunch without me?

1230
00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:09.552
That's what you did.

1231
00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:10.954
- Actually. I went to breakfast.

1232
00:58:10.954 --> 00:58:13.022
- Oh. okay. - And we didn't discuss lunch.

1233
00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:14.324
so.

1234
00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:16.860
You're here unannounced. right?

1235
00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:17.694
- No. I...

1236
00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:22.765
Yeah. I guess so.

1237
00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:26.569
Guess I'll just get some lunch by myself. huh?

1238
00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:28.404
- I'll call you.

1239
00:58:28.404 --> 00:58:29.239
- Yeah.

1240
00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:37.480
- Oh. he's mad.

1241
00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.415
Dropping by unannounced.

1242
00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:41.751
Missing dinner dates. lunch dates.

1243
00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:46.322
I'm sure that's not the guy you're dating. right?

1244
00:58:46.322 --> 00:58:48.258
- It's not what it looks like.

1245
00:58:48.258 --> 00:58:49.926
- I'm sure it isn't.

1246
00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.061
Here you go.

1247
00:58:58.001 --> 00:58:59.903
- Bitch. that shit was funny as fuck!

1248
00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:02.038
You are the devil himself.

1249
00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:04.541
- Shut up. You're so annoying.

1250
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:06.009
- Man. I can't believe she let you

1251
00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:07.911
take her out the other night.

1252
00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:09.212
- You can quit acting like I ain't the man

1253
00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:10.847
when it come in these ladies. bro.

1254
00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:11.781
- I mean. I ain't like the vibe

1255
00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:12.515
she was giving another night.

1256
00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:13.750
- You never do.

1257
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.451
- Besides. she a boujee bitch. man.

1258
00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:17.253
Look. I know you like these rude ass bitches.

1259
00:59:17.253 --> 00:59:18.521
but once you fuck. man.

1260
00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:19.355
you ain't gonna wanna deal with her no more.

1261
00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:20.790
- Oh.

1262
00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:23.259
I give her the attitude adjustment. All that changed.

1263
00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:24.193
- E. what's up. man?

1264
00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:25.428
- Dirty D. what's happening man?

1265
00:59:25.428 --> 00:59:27.096
- Not much. man. What y'all niggas on?

1266
00:59:27.096 --> 00:59:28.765
- Man. we're riding this fool I'm the man

1267
00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:30.366
when it come to these women.

1268
00:59:30.366 --> 00:59:32.869
- Boy. you're smooth ass. man.

1269
00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:36.472
That's funny. You still messing with that teacher chick?

1270
00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:37.307
- Yeah.

1271
00:59:39.342 --> 00:59:41.744
Yeah. but I got a doctor now.

1272
00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:44.113
- What the fuck?

1273
00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:45.348
You went on one date with her. now she your bitch?

1274
00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:46.282
- It's my lady. bro.

1275
00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:47.116
- Ew!

1276
00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.356
- Man. not this nigga blushing and shit.

1277
00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:56.726
Bro. you gotta be dating Beyonce. How she look?

1278
00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:57.827
- Bro.

1279
00:59:57.827 --> 00:59:59.329
She's gorgeous.

1280
00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:02.966
- [Mike] He's capping. capping. capping.

1281
01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:04.534
- Crazy part is. D.

1282
01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:07.203
she's a virgin.

1283
01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.972
- Nah bro. she a man.

1284
01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.574
Look bro. I'm fucking with you. bro.

1285
01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:15.578
But she a doctor. she fine as fuck. and she a virgin?

1286
01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:17.413
No cap. bro. she might not be a man.

1287
01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:19.048
but there's for sure something wrong with the bitch.

1288
01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:20.383
- Man. look.

1289
01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.951
I think the bitch gay.

1290
01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.486
You know what I'm saying?

1291
01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:27.256
The bitch look at pussy all day anyway. so I don't know.

1292
01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:30.994
I don't like her. - Right. you know what?

1293
01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.161
At the end of the day.

1294
01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.696
that's why you don't get no pussy.

1295
01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:36.099
And I'm out. So go ahead and lock up and say y'all later.

1296
01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:37.166
- Bro. where are you going?

1297
01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.534
We have a party tonight.

1298
01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:40.570
- I got a party too. it's called game night.

1299
01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:41.704
Some shit you don't know about.

1300
01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:42.739
- Yeah. all right. all right.

1301
01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:43.539
Yeah.

1302
01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:46.743
Come on.

1303
01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:50.013

Hi. - Hey.

1320
01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:18.608
These are for you.

1321
01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:19.609
- Thank you.

1322
01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:29.719
(soft upbeat music)

1323
01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:30.620
- Hey sexy!

1324
01:01:32.288 --> 01:01:33.356
- Slow night?

1325
01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:35.458
- You say that?

1326
01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.461
What can I get you?

1327
01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:40.463
- Can I have a sex on the beach please?

1328
01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:42.632
- Ooh. My type of girl.

1329
01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:45.635
Will anybody be joining you?

1330
01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:49.205
- Yes. but we can talk dirty till he get here.

1331
01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:50.306
- Ooh.

1332
01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:52.175
What's your name. babe?

1333
01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:54.143
- Tammy Davis.

1334
01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.278
- Tammy Davis.

1335
01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:58.147
Davis. Sound familiar.

1336
01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:59.549
- Oh yeah? - Yeah.

1337
01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.219
- Heineken please.

1338
01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:08.224
- You're late.

1339
01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:11.561
- I was following your request. Ms. Davis.

1340
01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.329
Well. this may not be a package of bullshit.

1341
01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.168
- PJ wasn't at home. Thank you.

1342
01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.405
PJ wasn't at home with his wife when the killing took place.

1343
01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:26.109
but I did get enough information for two new leads.

1344
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:27.477
Apparently Big Loke and your brother

1345
01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:29.445
were beefing up a territory.

1346
01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:31.080
Big Loke was running the North End.

1347
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.116
and your brother took it over.

1348
01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:34.350
He offered him to split it.

1349
01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:36.953
but your brother was not going for it.

1350
01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:40.056
That's a reason to kill somebody off.

1351
01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:43.960
- That's if the story's legit.

1352
01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.262
My brother wasn't greedy.

1353
01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:49.132
You say you got that story from PJ?

1354
01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.867
- It's all in this packet.

1355
01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:51.667
- Okay.

1356
01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:55.738
- Well. Candace went to a prison early this morning

1357
01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:58.107
to visit a guy named Morris White.

1358
01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.877
I thought that was weird. so I looked into it.

1359
01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:03.746
That's her ex-boyfriend from a few years back.

1360
01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:05.448
Crazy. right?

1361
01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:06.783
Now. she left the prison.

1362
01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.618
and he went to go visit your sister.

1363
01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:11.120
Now. I watched the footage from Terrance and Candace

1364
01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.322
over and over again at the bar.

1365
01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:15.958
It seems to me that she got mad. calmed down.

1366
01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.860
but then got mad again.

1367
01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:21.063
- [Tammy] Well. did you question her about the conversation?

1368
01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:23.299
- Of course I did.

1369
01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:25.568
She says that he was trying to get back with her.

1370
01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:28.504
They broke up. because he didn't want her to have the baby.

1371
01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:30.706
- So she knew that he was never leaving his family

1372
01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:32.341
to be with her.

1373
01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.776
- It seems to me.

1374
01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:39.382
- So what if she was angry?

1375
01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:42.051
Is that not enough reason to kill someone off?

1376
01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:43.119
- Tammy. are you serious?

1377
01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:45.655
- No. don't Tammy me. okay?

1378
01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:46.923
- Right. - Look.

1379
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:50.059
you're the detective on this job.

1380
01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:53.062
Not me. I can't do my job and yours.

1381
01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.102
- Are you in denial or dick drunk?

1382
01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:01.904
I told you Eddie did it.

1383
01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:04.473
(upbeat music)

1384
01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:13.516
- Definitely gonna need another one of these.

1385
01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:16.419
- [Mike] Sure thing. Angela Valdes.

1386
01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.689
- I am so not Angela Valdes.

1387
01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:22.992
I don't like bad boys.

1388
01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:27.296
I just like having sex with them.

1389
01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:32.001
- My brother chose the street life

1390
01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:34.070
and now my family is suffering from it.

1391
01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:36.072
The plan was to go to the Mental Illness Convention

1392
01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:37.640
this year in Brazil.

1393
01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.344
We promised my dad we would before he died.

1394
01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:44.013
This is getting extremely boring.

1395
01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:45.781
Is your friend still coming?

1396
01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:48.017
- You know what? I don't think he is.

1397
01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:51.787
He has this whole thing set up with his kids.

1398
01:04:51.787 --> 01:04:53.556
- Looks like Amina is standing me up too.

1399
01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.224
You want some more champagne?

1400
01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:56.759
- Yeah.

1401
01:04:56.759 --> 01:05:00.029
- Yes to champagne or Amina standing me up?

1402
01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:00.796
- Both.

1403
01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.132
- Freaking bitch.

1404
01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:06.202
- Hey look. chill on Amina. all right?

1405
01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:09.205
Listen. I wanted to spend more time with you. so.

1406
01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:11.741
I had her help me out a little bit.

1407
01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.476
- Well. you know. asking a woman out on a date

1408
01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:16.045
is how you get more time.

1409
01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:19.215
- Yeah. but this was more interesting.

1410
01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:24.053
More intense and more meaningful.

1411
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:31.394
- So do you have kids? Color is red. by the way.

1412
01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:35.164
- Actually I do. Twin boys. Maurice and Marcus.

1413
01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:36.399
- They live with you?

1414
01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:39.168
- Nope. They stay with their mom in Tennessee.

1415
01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:40.569
- Divorced?

1416
01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:41.404
- Nah.

1417
01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:45.408
Nah. I was young and didn't know

1418
01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:48.544
how to treat a woman back then.

1419
01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:50.313
- So you know now.

1420
01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:52.081
- You know what?

1421
01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:55.918
I could show you better than I could tell you.

1422
01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:59.855
- Aren't you gonna ask about my kid?

1423
01:05:59.855 --> 01:06:01.590
- You got a kid?

1424
01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.592
- Don't sound so surprised.

1425
01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:04.427
- I mean.

1426
01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:07.763
you are a virgin. right?

1427
01:06:09.231 --> 01:06:12.468
- Totally slipped my mind that Amina told you that.

1428
01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:16.872
- Oh man. listen. Let's chill on the champagne. okay?

1429
01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:19.608
- No. I'm good.

1430
01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:20.810
I swear.

1431
01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.745
I'm good. It's Chanel.

1432
01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:25.581
She's my niece. but she's more like my daughter.

1433
01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:28.818
- I noticed the pictures when I was coming in.

1434
01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.319
So answer me this.

1435
01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:35.424
What's up with this whole dating. but not dating thing?

1436
01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:36.258
- Drew.

1437
01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.296
How do I explain this?

1438
01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:41.797
Drew is my person.

1439
01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.266
My best friend.

1440
01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:50.172
The only person that really understands me. Sometimes.

1441
01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:55.378
- Do you love him?

1442
01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:56.645
- He's perfect.

1443
01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:01.417
- So why aren't you with the man of your dreams?

1444
01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:05.087
- I said he was perfect.

1445
01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:08.491
I never said he was the man of my dreams.

1446
01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:11.360
But what about you?

1447
01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:14.296
Do you have a person?

1448
01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:19.068
- Everybody has somebody. right?

1449
01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:20.936
I guess so.

1450
01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:25.274
I'm gonna kiss you.

1451
01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:28.244
- Well. then do it.

1452
01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:40.856
- [Tammy] Slow down!

1453
01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:42.625
Slow down. slow down!

1454
01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:55.604
- Dad. dad. dad. dad. dad. dad. dad!

1455
01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:57.039
I did it. I did it!

1456
01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:58.574
I did- - No.

1457
01:07:58.574 --> 01:07:59.875
Don't you see I'm helping your sister Tameka

1458
01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:01.110
with her homework?

1459
01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:02.778
- Dad. - I'll be right...

1460
01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:03.612
- Dad.

1461
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.083
(somber music)

1462
01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:20.963
(Esson laughing)

1463
01:08:20.963 --> 01:08:23.599
- Hey. you know I would. dude.

1464
01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:24.433
Yeah.

1465
01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:28.504
Hey look. just do it. and really...

1466
01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:32.308
I don't know. You know what I'm saying.

1467
01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:34.410
(tense music)

1468
01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.244
Shit!

1469
01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.914
Let me call you back. baby.

1470
01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:41.016
Why are you sitting in the dark?

1471
01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:42.618
- Who is she?

1472
01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:43.819
- Who is who?

1473
01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:45.187
- The bitch you're cheating with.

1474
01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:47.456
The bitch you just left.

1475
01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:50.392
The one you bought pink roses for twice!

1476
01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:52.561
And a dirty bitch at that.

1477
01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:56.198
- Krystal. you really need to speak on shit that you know.

1478
01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.534
- I know you gave me gonorrhea and a bacteria infection

1479
01:08:58.534 --> 01:09:00.536
for the third time.

1480
01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:03.339
So I got it. she got it.

1481
01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:06.142
- I'm not fucking nobody. Krystal.

1482
01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:09.245
- I don't know why I'm not enough for you.

1483
01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:10.479
My doctor called me in for blood work

1484
01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:13.315
because my cultures are so fucked up.

1485
01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:17.887
She found something in my pap that wasn't normal.

1486
01:09:17.887 --> 01:09:20.055
I have cells on my pelvic.

1487
01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:22.691
and now she's checking my blood work to make sure

1488
01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:24.860
it's not life-threatening.

1489
01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:28.297
- I got tested. Remember?

1490
01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:32.735
I got the paperwork to prove it.

1491
01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:35.271
- Last month you told me you wanted to see other people.

1492
01:09:35.271 --> 01:09:37.306
and then I get burned.

1493
01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:38.674
Now you coming in at 6:00 a.m..

1494
01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.476
so you haven't been with anyone else?

1495
01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:42.011
- Yeah. I said that. - Really? Really. Esson?

1496
01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.913
- Yeah. I said that.

1497
01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:46.248
- Were you with her tonight?

1498
01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:48.517
- Yeah.

1499
01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:49.351
- Esson!

1500
01:09:50.753 --> 01:09:52.555
I have one of the best gynecologists in the city

1501
01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.590
who doesn't make mistakes.

1502
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.192
So you're fucking somebody.

1503
01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.093
This shit ain't come from the air.

1504
01:09:58.093 --> 01:10:01.530
- I'm not fucking nobody. Krystal.

1505
01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.032
I just got tested.

1506
01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:04.767
Remember?

1507
01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:08.304
- Get tested by my doctor. She treats guys too.

1508
01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:11.807
- Are you outta your fucking mind?

1509
01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:14.877
- I'm not getting tested by no fucking OBGYN.

1510
01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.046
I just told you. I'm good!

1511
01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:24.486
Well. I'm not good.

1512
01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:26.322
So get treated for me and then we can figure

1513
01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:28.090
the rest of this out.

1514
01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:30.659
Do you love her?

1515
01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:33.195
Do you love me?

1516
01:10:36.198 --> 01:10:38.100
- Of course. Krystal.

1517
01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:41.170
I'm just not in love with you.

1518
01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:43.906
We're not even fucking. remember?

1519
01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:48.210
No.

1520
01:10:49.144 --> 01:10:51.880
(dramatic music)

1521
01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:57.686
- I'll schedule the appointment for you.

1522
01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:03.726
(tense music)

1523
01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:04.560
- Fuck.

1524
01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:10.232
(upbeat music)

1525
01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:14.470
- [Chanel] Mom. I'm going!

1526
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.041
Ma!

1527
01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:19.875
I'm gone.

1528
01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:23.612
(upbeat music)

1529
01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:31.120

- Tammy. Girl. what the hell is wrong with you?

1534
01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:59.081
Don't you know Chanel is watching everything you do?

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:03.152
She been watching you since she was a little girl.

1536
01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:09.325
And you wonder why she looks up to Tameka?

1537
01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:14.196
You know they teasing her at school. right?

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:22.204
They're teasing her at school because you stole

1541
01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:25.107
all of her school equipment.

1542
01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:28.777
And the rumor is that you were being served.

1543
01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:33.649
Her uncle tried to be Captain Save-A-Ho and got got.

1544
01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:37.586
And she looks up to Tameka. just like my daddy did.

1545
01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:39.855
It was always about Tameka.

1546
01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:45.828
She was delusional from birth. and whatever you did to her

1547
01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.162
made my daddy feel like he just need to give her

1548
01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:48.664
all his attention.

1549
01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:52.234
So he loved her more.

1550
01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.106
Forgetting to love me too.

1551
01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:02.444
So excuse me if I'm looking for something in these men

1552
01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:05.914
that you and my daddy couldn't give to me.

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.440
Ever since Terrance got killed.

1602
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.542
niggas ain't even been working.

1603
01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:15.811
They've been so shook.

1604
01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:19.114
- You think I give a fuck about a nigga being shook?

1605
01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:21.783
Shit don't stop 'cause a nigga dead.

1606
01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:23.051
Yo. T was my nigga. We was fucking.

1607
01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:26.021
You see me moping around this bitch?

1608
01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:30.759
Still money to be made.

1609
01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:34.162
- So you killed him?

1610
01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:40.502
- I'm gonna kill you if you don't get this done.

1611
01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:42.504
The fuck out of my face.

1612
01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:57.853
- What's up. Ace?

1613
01:15:57.853 --> 01:15:59.021
- Did you make sure nobody was following you?

1614
01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:00.389
- Of course.

1615
01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:01.290
- [Mike] Hey. what you drink?

1616
01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.624
- No. I'm straight.

1617
01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:03.559
- [Mike] All right.

1618
01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.093
- Look. I need another lawyer.

1619
01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:06.495
They're trying to pin T's death on me.

1620
01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:08.764
- Relax. I'm on it. - Relax?

1621
01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:11.934
Relax?

1622
01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.735
They fucking with my wife.

1623
01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:16.104
Going up to her job and shit.

1624
01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:17.873
- Her work? - Yeah.

1625
01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:19.541
And they raided one of my spots.

1626
01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:22.511
Loke just ain't answering the phone. Shit crazy. Ace.

1627
01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:25.047
- Now. why he ain't answer? - And you know they always ask

1628
01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:26.782
about that North End shit too.

1629
01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:28.650
- Wonder how they know about that.

1630
01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:30.319
- Come on. Ace.

1631
01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:31.787
Streets talk.

1632
01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:33.388
Who didn't know about that beef?

1633
01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:34.723
- That's what they wanted y'all to think.

1634
01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:36.892
Folks didn't do that shit.

1635
01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.595
- How you know?

1636
01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:41.663
You did it?

1637
01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:43.732
- PJ. are you fucking stupid?

1638
01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:45.834
He was my nigga. we was fucking.

1639
01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:48.904
- Yeah. And he was fucking Shorty too.

1640
01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:53.075
Call me when you got a better lawyer worth paying.

1641
01:16:58.347 --> 01:17:01.016
(dramatic music)

1642
01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.520
- Damn. when the last time you got checked. E?

1643
01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.155
- It was like three months ago.

1644
01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:08.657
Everything was good.

1645
01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:11.159
Now she want me to go get tested by her doctor.

1646
01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.728
And the fucked up part is.

1647
01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:14.496
her doctor is my lady. bro.

1648
01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:15.731
- Oh. you talking about the bitch

1650
01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:18.166
- D. come on.

1651
01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.434
- Damn. my bad.

1652
01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:21.837
You right. bro. I can't be calling her no bitch.

1653
01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:23.538
But you love this ho. don't you?

1654
01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:25.907
Her pussy must be fine.

1655
01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:27.075
- The nigga wanna know?

1656
01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:29.211
They ain't even fuck yet.

1657
01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:30.712
- Hey babe. what's up? - Hey.

1658
01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:32.180

- Yeah. this is my boy D. this is my lady.

1660
01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:36.184
- Dr. Gorgeous.

1661
01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:37.386
- Nice to meet you.

1662
01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:38.754
- And you know this fool right here.

1663
01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:40.489
- What up. Dr. Davis?

1664
01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:46.128
- I'm gonna slide. bro. I'm gonna let you talk to your lady.

1665
01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:46.928
Whatever.

1666
01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.169
- That's water. - Oh.

1667
01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:58.807
- [Mike] Well. pay me then.

1668
01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:09.051
- Can I get a minute. bro?

1669
01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:13.121
Can I get a minute. bro? - Oh shit!

1670
01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:14.356
My bad. bro.

1671
01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.491
Oh yeah. you wanna go do some co-owner stuff!

1672
01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.527
Yeah. like inventory. right?

1673
01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.128
'Cause I co-own the bar.

1674
01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.363
Got you. Yeah.

1675
01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:22.631
Hey ladies. you know shots on me.

1676
01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:23.965
Co-owner. Psych.

1677
01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.334
- He is so weird.

1678
01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:27.569
- Gotta love him.

1679
01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:28.870
- What's up. babe. what's going on?

1680
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.338
- Hey look. I called you down here

1681
01:18:30.338 --> 01:18:33.508
'cause we gotta keep it 100 with each other.

1682
01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:36.244
Mainly about our persons.

1683
01:18:36.244 --> 01:18:39.715
and them being a factor still in our life.

1684
01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:43.185
Let's not let nothing blindside us. okay?

1685
01:18:43.185 --> 01:18:47.689
- Okay babe. but you could have said that over the phone.

1686
01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:49.191
What's really going on?

1687
01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:51.760
- Yeah. I could have.

1688
01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.930
but my person is one of your patients.

1689
01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:00.736
I got tested a few months ago.

1690
01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:04.573
and look. everything is being faxed over to you as we speak.

1691
01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.641
However. when I got home.

1692
01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:10.746
my person. she told me she had a abnormal pap read

1693
01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:14.049
that was performed by you. so.

1694
01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:15.217
- Does she know about this?

1695
01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:16.418
- No.

1696
01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:17.519
- Who is she?

1697
01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:21.423
Esson.

1698
01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:23.959
Who is it?

1699
01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:27.829
- Krystal.

1700
01:19:27.829 --> 01:19:29.731
- With her being my patient and HIPAA.

1701
01:19:29.731 --> 01:19:31.533
I can't really talk about- - Oh. no. no. no. no.

1702
01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:34.002
I totally understand. totally.

1703
01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:35.270
All right?

1704
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:37.172
It's just. she set us an appointment

1705
01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:38.974
for us both to come in. all right?

1706
01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:42.811
And I didn't wanna have nothing blindside you.

1707
01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:47.449
- You know what?

1708
01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.718
You turn me on in a lot of ways.

1709
01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:52.320
but this. it's just undeniable.

1710
01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.761
- Look. let's cheerio.

1711
01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:02.164
before you don't make it to your person. all right?

1712
01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:04.032
- You're right.

1713
01:20:04.032 --> 01:20:05.767
You're right. let me get out of here.

1714
01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:06.601
- Hey.

1715
01:20:07.502 --> 01:20:09.871
Tell him the good news.

1716
01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:11.039
- What's this?

1717
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:17.813
Oh my God! We're going to Brazil!

1718
01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.214
Oh my God. Esson!

1719
01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:21.950
We're going to the convention?

1720
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:24.319
Oh my God. you want me to fall in love with you. don't you?

1721
01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.921
- I do.

1722
01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:27.756
It be working? - It is.

1723
01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:32.727
I'm going to the convention!

1724
01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:33.562
Yes!

1725
01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:37.866
- That smiling doctor is out. huh?

1726
01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:39.768
- Shut up. nigga.

1727
01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.736
I like her. yo!

1728
01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:44.172
- Nigga. what if you don't fuck?

1729
01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.908
- We're fucking the morning of.

1730
01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:50.278
On the way to the plane. on the plane and when we land.

1731
01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:52.981
And every fucking night after.

1732
01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.783
- I hope she worth it.

1733
01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:58.119
- You see the smile?

1734
01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:01.122
Hell yeah she worth it.

1735
01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:03.925
- Hey.

1736
01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.560
did she ever tell you her brother name?

1737
01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.528
The one that got killed?

1738
01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:07.729
- Yeah. why?

1739
01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.464
- Man. this bitch came here the other day

1740
01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:11.066
talking to one of Loke's workers about it.

1741
01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:13.001
- Is that right? - Yeah.

1742
01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.536
I think the bitch did it.

1743
01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.872
but she trying to have dog take the rap for it.

1744
01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.374
Now I did see there was a 10.000 K reward on that.

1745
01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:20.675
Shoot. we could call that number

1746
01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:23.545
and get this easy 10K right quick.

1747
01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.647
- You know what?

1748
01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:27.582
Don't call that number.

1749
01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:30.785
I'll give you five. right?

1750
01:21:32.754 --> 01:21:34.789
Hey. what time was that?

1751
01:21:34.789 --> 01:21:35.624
Like 1:32.

1752
01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:39.060
- Was the music on?

1753
01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.762
- Yeah. But you'll probably hear the conversation

1754
01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:42.864
through the register cameras.

1755
01:21:42.864 --> 01:21:45.433
- Hmm. Download that.

1756
01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:47.135
Send it to me.

1757
01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:47.936
All right.

1758
01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:59.114
- Well. you look beautiful as always.

1759
01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:01.583
- Thank you. Are you having your usual?

1760
01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.418
- You know me so well.

1761
01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.221
- You're predictable. Drew.

1762
01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:08.223
- Really? - Yes. Really.

1763
01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:11.793
- Good evening. Dr. Powell. Dr. Davis.

1764
01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:13.061
- [Tameka] Hi. how are you. Key?

1765
01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:14.963
- I'm good thank you. I have champagne for you.

1766
01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.531
- All right. - So he'll have the usual

1767
01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:18.466
and I'll take a garden salad. extra olives.

1768
01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:20.735
- Okay. - Thank you.

1769
01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:22.637
- I'll get that for you. - Okay.

1770
01:22:22.637 --> 01:22:24.372
How was the big surgery?

1771
01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:26.675
- Well. I guess this is a celebration.

1772
01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:28.310
- Okay. well we can toast to it.

1773
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:29.144
- Yes.

1774
01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.981
Although. I only have four months to teach 10 residents

1775
01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:35.750
how to perform the surgery.

1776
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:39.220
So I won't be making the convention. unfortunately.

1777
01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:40.055
Yeah.

1778
01:22:41.423 --> 01:22:43.858
- Wow. - But enough about me.

1779
01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:45.427
This glow you have.

1780
01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:48.730
I like it.

1781
01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:49.764
What is it?

1782
01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:50.932
- You noticed?

1783
01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:54.436
- Of course I noticed. How couldn't I?

1784
01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:55.303
What is it?

1785
01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:58.506
- Nothing much. Just work.

1786
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:01.509
- Work.

1787
01:23:03.678 --> 01:23:05.347
So let me get this straight.

1788
01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:07.949
So you buy a new purse for work.

1789
01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:11.052
change your hairstyle for work.

1790
01:23:11.052 --> 01:23:15.290
You even being nice to people. all because of work?

1791
01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:17.993
- I'm going to the convention.

1792
01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.260
I was so excited to tell you.

1793
01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.829
but then when you told me you weren't going.

1794
01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:22.964
I thought maybe I'd just wait.

1795
01:23:22.964 --> 01:23:24.432
I'm getting back to my life.

1796
01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:28.303
- Congratulations. So you taking Chanel?

1797
01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:30.205
- Yeah. Well. no.

1798
01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:32.107
Well I'm not really sure yet.

1799
01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:33.742
- Why? - Because I really need

1800
01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:38.046
to focus on what my next move is gonna be. you know?

1801
01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:41.549
- So you're really considering going back to school.

1802
01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:44.619
- Drew. we talked about this. I wanna be a psychologist.

1803
01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:46.121
- And make less money?

1804
01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:48.323
- Actually. my plan is to triple my yearly income.

1805
01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:49.491
- Okay listen.

1806
01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:54.429
the private pharmacy is doing numbers right now.

1807
01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:55.597
Numbers.

1808
01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:56.831
So just take my 20%.

1809
01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:58.166
- It's not about the money. Drew.

1810
01:23:58.166 --> 01:23:59.834
- Then what is it...

1811
01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:03.738
Then what is it about? Your dad?

1812
01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.242
I'm sorry.

1813
01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:09.644
I didn't mean that to come out like that.

1814
01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:10.845
- Well. what the hell did you mean?

1815
01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:12.547
- See what I'm talking about?

1816
01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:16.351
You at rage and you don't even notice your own anger.

1817
01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:19.020
but you wanna be a psychologist.

1818
01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:21.756
Fuck you. Drew.

1819
01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:27.128
- Yeah. fuck me.

1820
01:24:30.665 --> 01:24:31.499
Okay.

1821
01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:39.974
- He's so sexy and charming.

1822
01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:41.743
and honest and loyal.

1823
01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:46.714
His penis is little.

1824
01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:47.982
- No. it's not.

1825
01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:49.484
We both see him in him in them gray joggers.

1826
01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:50.552
We know it's not little.

1827
01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:51.719
- He's terrible in bed.

1828
01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:53.054
- And how would you know?

1829
01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:53.955
- You think he's controlling?

1830
01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:55.690
- Tameka. stop!

1831
01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:59.327
Can you please live a little for once?

1832
01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:01.362
And speaking of the king.

1833
01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:05.366
- Good morning. Krystal. Sign in. please.

1834
01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:06.201
Ooh. shit!

1835
01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:10.305
- Good morning. Dr. Davis.

1836
01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:11.473
This is my boyfriend. Esson.

1837
01:25:11.473 --> 01:25:14.476
He has an appointment for STD testing.

1838
01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:17.879
- Exam room five all the way to the back.

1839
01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:27.489
- What the fuck is going on here?

1840
01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:29.524
- Be quiet. I will tell you everything later.

1841
01:25:29.524 --> 01:25:31.659
Get blood work in a urine sample.

1842
01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:34.229
- Okay. - And their vitals.

1843
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:35.797
- What's going on? You're not gonna come back-

1844
01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.465
- I will tell you everything later.

1845
01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:39.167
Would you just go do your job?

1846
01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:40.235
- Okay. okay.

1847
01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:51.813
(door knocking)

1848
01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.481
Hi. I'm nurse Amina.

1849
01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:55.250
I'm just here to get your vitals.

1850
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:56.584
- Dr. Davis isn't coming in?

1851
01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:58.386
I had a few questions.

1852
01:25:58.386 --> 01:26:00.955
- [Amina] Okay. maybe I can help you with them.

1853
01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:03.291
- No offense Amina. but I wanna speak to Dr. Davis.

1854
01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:04.559
- Yeah. so do I.

1855
01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:08.463
- Okay. no problem. I'll get her in one moment.

1856
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:23.811
They want Dr. Davis.

1857
01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:25.847
- Oh. cheer up. Amina.

1858
01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:27.849
I pay you to do nothing.

1859
01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:40.128
Esson Jones.

1860
01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:42.130
Nice to meet you. I am Dr. Tameka Davis.

1861
01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:43.498
What brings you in today?

1862
01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:45.066
- I already told you.

1863
01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:47.969
- Excuse me. - He meant I told you.

1864
01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:50.605
He's just here for blood work and STD testing.

1865
01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:53.708
and I wanna be retested also.

1866
01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:55.977
- Okay. any pain when urinating?

1867
01:26:55.977 --> 01:26:58.346
Discharge from the penis? Blood in your urine or stool?

1868
01:26:58.346 --> 01:27:00.515
- Not that I'm aware of.

1869
01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:03.318
- Meaning you're not sure. or?

1870
01:27:03.318 --> 01:27:05.119
- They sent the files over. correct?

1871
01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:05.954
- Esson.

1872
01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:09.791
I'm sorry. Dr. Davis.

1873
01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:12.327
- It's fine. Krystal. you were recently here.

1874
01:27:12.327 --> 01:27:13.828
Have you guys been sexually active since you-

1875
01:27:13.828 --> 01:27:14.662
- Hell no.

1876
01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:18.433
- No. we haven't.

1877
01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:21.603
- Look. I'm excellent. Be sure though.

1878
01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:23.571
- Can never be too sure.

1879
01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:25.206
So as I'm looking over your records here.

1880
01:27:25.206 --> 01:27:26.874
you checked heart conditions.

1881
01:27:26.874 --> 01:27:28.409
Do you care to elaborate?

1882
01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:32.947
- Ain't no real conditions. I just wear it on my sleeve.

1883
01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:36.451
- So no sign of STDs. no pain.

1884
01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:38.920
- He came because I asked him.

1885
01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.522
Once you told me my pap was abnormal. I was worried.

1886
01:27:41.522 --> 01:27:42.624
- Gotcha.

1887
01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:44.092
Okay. so for the gentleman.

1888
01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:46.160
I can treat you for the common STDs.

1889
01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.529
However. my partner. Dr. Hummus.

1890
01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:50.565
who just so happens to be a urologist

1891
01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:52.467
will treat you for the following.

1892
01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:55.036
I will give you guys a few minutes to read that over.

1893
01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:56.204
If you agree. sign and date

1894
01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:58.072
and I will get things in motion. okay?

1895
01:27:58.072 --> 01:27:59.340
- Okay. Thank you. Dr. Davis.

1896
01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.843
- No problem. It's my pleasure.

1897
01:28:07.215 --> 01:28:09.250
If everything comes back negative.

1898
01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:12.120
I'm gonna give him this vagina.

1899
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.821
- First off. it's pussy.

1900
01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:14.656
- Whatever.

1901
01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.391
- And yes bitch!

1902
01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:19.394
- Get vitals. urine sample and blood work.

1903
01:28:19.394 --> 01:28:21.462
Go. go. go. go! - Okay. okay!

1904
01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:24.632
- I can't wait till you get some dick.

1905
01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:30.638
- You. - Your fault.

1906
01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:31.539
- We're here because of you. - A OBGYN.

1907
01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:32.540
come on. no. - Hi!

1908
01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.775
- No! - I'm just back to get

1909
01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:36.077
a urine sample and some blood work.

1910
01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:40.081
And the bathroom is the first door on the left.

1911
01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.618
- Hey. it's Amina. right?

1912
01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:44.952
- Hmm-mmm. - How soon can you get

1913
01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:46.954
these results back?

1914
01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:48.623
- It typically takes about two weeks.

1915
01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:50.725
but Dr. Davis seems to like you.

1916
01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:53.161
so I'm sure she'll put a rush on it.

1917
01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:54.395
Why?

1918
01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:55.596
- I'm headed out the country in two weeks.

1919
01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:57.098
I just want it before I leave.

1920
01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:59.500
- Okay. I'll definitely make a note of that.

1921
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:03.705
And could you go ahead and get on the table for me?

1922
01:29:11.913 --> 01:29:14.015
Bitch. he's taking us to the convention?

1923
01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:17.251
- You wish. Not you. just the two of us.

1924
01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:19.520
- Yes. bitch! Release that pussy!

1925
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.223
- Would you be quiet? - Sorry.

1926
01:29:22.223 --> 01:29:23.491
- Gosh. - Everything come back

1927
01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:26.427
negative. I feel bad for that girl.

1928
01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:28.429
Ooh. like a thief and a night!

1929
01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:30.131
You is a bad bitch.

1930
01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:32.100
- Just call me Dr. Davis.

1931
01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.434
- I am so proud.

1932
01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:36.604
(cheerful music)

1933
01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:37.972
- All right y'all. now onto the next gift.

1934
01:29:37.972 --> 01:29:40.274
We had a gift from...

1935
01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:43.745
Let's do this one. do this one. do this one.

1936
01:29:43.745 --> 01:29:47.448
Ah. a shower of wishes. This one is from Morris.

1937
01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:48.683
Okay.

1938
01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:50.985
Candy. I wish I was out to share

1939
01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:52.754
this special moment with you.

1940
01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.489
You are a strong. beautiful person

1941
01:29:54.489 --> 01:29:57.191
who can make it through anything.

1942
01:29:57.191 --> 01:30:00.328
Hold it down and look up. I'll be home soon.

1943
01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:02.130
Kiss baby Tara for me.

1944
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.264
Morris.

1945
01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:04.432
- [Women] Aww!

1946
01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:08.403
- He said all this... This from jail. y'all.

1947
01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:09.604
From jail. - Okay. Morris.

1948
01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:10.705
- From jail.

1949
01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:12.306
- Okay. - From jail y'all.

1950
01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:16.077
Just a minute. Take notes. take notes.

1951
01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:18.246
- Thanks for coming. It really means a lot.

1952
01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:20.181
- My pleasure.

1953
01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:21.349
- Here you go.

1954
01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:25.987
I have a question.

1955
01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:28.756
Would you be having this baby if my brother was still alive?

1956
01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:31.325
- [Candace] Probably not.

1957
01:30:31.325 --> 01:30:33.294
- Is it because you know it's not his?

1958
01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:34.128
- No.

1959
01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:36.497
- So your visit last week.

1960
01:30:36.497 --> 01:30:38.566
- What about it? - Did you tell him

1961
01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:43.371
it wasn't his. or did you tell him you didn't know?

1962
01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:44.705
- [Woman] What's going on?

1963
01:30:44.705 --> 01:30:46.707
- This is Terrance Davis's baby.

1964
01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.075
So can I enjoy my moment?

1965
01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:49.610
- Ma. I kind of believe her.

1966
01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:50.945
- Yeah. I'm not convinced.

1967
01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:52.980
Where's Jaynaye? - Who?

1968
01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:53.948
- You know. the little thot that you was with

1969
01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:56.551
the night at my brother's death.

1970
01:31:08.029 --> 01:31:10.698
(Eddie sighing)

1971
01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:16.337
(gunshots firing) - Oh shit!

1972
01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:18.539
Bitch ass nigga! (gunshots firing)

1973
01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:21.042
(tense music)

1974
01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:25.680
(gunshot firing)

1975
01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:26.514
The fuck you going?

1976
01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:27.448
- [Man] Oh.

1977
01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.822
- Nigga! Who sent you?

1978
01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:38.593
- Man. fuck- (gunshots firing)

1979
01:31:38.593 --> 01:31:42.029
- That's my friend and she don't live here.

1980
01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:44.365
- Well. when I find my mother.

1981
01:31:44.365 --> 01:31:48.169
I want that DNA that you offered my sister.

1982
01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:49.403
- Oh. I found her.

1983
01:31:49.403 --> 01:31:51.339
Hold on one second. mom. give me one second.

1984
01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:52.139
Hold on.

1985
01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:54.742
- I thought I told you to stay in the car.

1986
01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:56.511
- Yeah. So messy.

1987
01:31:56.511 --> 01:32:01.115
- It's Poreshanella. Don't you need her for the test?

1988
01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:03.017
- What's up mom? Where you at?

1989
01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:05.286
It's cute in here. A bit basic.

1990
01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:06.954
My shower was classier.

1991
01:32:06.954 --> 01:32:08.890
Yeah. Nice dress too.

1992
01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:10.424
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1993
01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:12.560
- Nice dress love. yeah. - Yeah.

1994
01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.295
- We're leaving. - Bye!

1995

Enjoy your gift. love!

1996
01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:17.031
- Bye. - Yeah.

1997
01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:23.538
- Are they here yet?

1998
01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:24.372
- Not yet.

1999
01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:26.774
- Well. you mind if I get outta here?

2000
01:32:26.774 --> 01:32:27.708
It's getting pretty late and you know

2001
01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:29.710
I gotta hold it down next week.

2002
01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:31.212
- Yeah. you can go.

2003
01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.346
I'll be fine.

2004
01:32:32.346 --> 01:32:33.180
- Okay.

2005
01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:34.782
Well look. have fun.

2006
01:32:34.782 --> 01:32:36.617
Be safe and do it raw.

2007
01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:41.489
Ooh. if the results come back negative. you better be nasty!

2008
01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:43.624
- You're disgusting.

2009
01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:44.926
- Okay. so look.

2010
01:32:44.926 --> 01:32:46.627
remember what I showed you with the cucumber.

2011
01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:48.896
Two hands. extra spit.

2012
01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:52.333
Don't be scared. and it's just dick.

2013
01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:53.301
You don't gotta be scared.

2014
01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:55.069
I had two at one time before.

2015
01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:57.438
Chanel's gift is already in your car.

2016
01:32:57.438 --> 01:32:58.839
and tell her I say happy birthday.

2017
01:32:58.839 --> 01:32:59.640
Bye!

2018
01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.009
Love you!

2019
01:33:09.984 --> 01:33:12.653
(phone ringing)

2020
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:20.494
- I've actually been waiting on this call all day.

2021
01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:25.066
Yeah. I'm gonna head there when I leave here.

2022
01:33:25.066 --> 01:33:28.736
Of course not. My family is so embarrassing.

2023
01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:35.042
I promise. I won't be long. I still have packing to do.

2024
01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:36.110
Okay. I will.

2025
01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:42.950
(phone dinging)

2026
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:45.786
(uplifting music)

2027
01:33:48.155 --> 01:33:49.323
- Oh my Davis.

2028
01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:52.793
This is great.

2029
01:33:55.663 --> 01:33:59.834
- [Poreshanella] He does look just like his daddy!

2030
01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:04.572
- Hey auntie! Are you just now leaving the office?

2031
01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:06.140
- Yeah. sorry I'm late.

2032
01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:08.409
You look beautiful. - So do you.

Thank you. but so do you. as always.

2034
01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:14.315
but what's this look?

2035
01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:15.850
- Yeah. you're all smiling and shit.

2036
01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.852
What's the word. brother?

2037
01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:20.021
- Hey Angel. Poreshanella.

2038
01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:22.089
Tammy.

2039
01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:26.761
- What you smiling about?

2040
01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:28.295
- I still can't believe y'all went

2041
01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:30.164
to this girl's baby shower.

2042
01:34:30.164 --> 01:34:32.633
- Grandma. it was the mama Angel's idea.

2043
01:34:32.633 --> 01:34:35.636
You know how messy they can be.

2044
01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:38.105
- I need my luggage. bro.

2045
01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:40.307
I haven't worn that since last year.

2046
01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:41.709
Chanel. can you go get that luggage

2047
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:42.943
out of my closet. please?

2048
01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:44.545
- Yeah. - Thank you.

2049
01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:47.248
- Where are you going?

2050
01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.215
- Brazil.

2051
01:34:48.215 --> 01:34:50.084
- Brazil? - Ooh.

2052
01:34:50.084 --> 01:34:53.120
- You talking about that mental illness doctor shit?

2053
01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.423
Yeah. nigga Terrance told me about that.

2054
01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:56.924
You going with that nigga. Drew?

2055
01:34:56.924 --> 01:34:58.426
That handyman nigga Drew?

2056
01:34:58.426 --> 01:35:00.628
- [Chanel] It's called a convention.

2057
01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:02.096
- What's that?

2058
01:35:02.096 --> 01:35:03.631
- It's where a group of doctors get together

2059
01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:06.600
to discuss methods for curing disease.

2060
01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:10.171
They have one every five years for mental health in Brazil.

2061
01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:11.806
Their dad took me years ago.

2062
01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:13.441
- Chanel baby. I gotta dip in a minute.

2063
01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:14.775
Go on. open your gifts.

2064
01:35:14.775 --> 01:35:17.445
- Yeah. open mine first.

2065
01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:18.679
What?

2066
01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:20.748
And by the way. Drew's not going.

2067
01:35:20.748 --> 01:35:21.849
- [Eddie] So?

2068
01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:25.252
- A bag!

2069
01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:27.455
Auntie got me a bag?

2070
01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:29.090
Oh my God. You're the best!

2071
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:31.425
I thought it was like some perfume or something!

2072
01:35:31.425 --> 01:35:34.128
- You're welcome. Thanks for always keeping your grades up.

2073
01:35:34.128 --> 01:35:35.596
- All right. see. come on now.

2074
01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:39.300
Go and open this gift. it's from me and Terrance.

2075
01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.869
(upbeat music)

2076
01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:47.808
- A car?

2077
01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:50.144
Oh! You got me a car. Eddie?

2078
01:35:51.378 --> 01:35:52.646
- Go check it out. babe.

2079
01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:55.716
- [Chanel] I'm about to go test drive it!

2080
01:35:59.019 --> 01:36:00.421
- You don't think it was a good idea to ask me

2081
01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:01.889
about getting my daughter a car?

2082
01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:04.358
- Shut that shit up. The nigga Terrance been nought it.

2083
01:36:04.358 --> 01:36:08.562
He was just waiting on her birthday to give it to her.

2084
01:36:08.562 --> 01:36:09.897
- [Poreshanella] What did you give?

2085
01:36:09.897 --> 01:36:12.399
- I gave her $2.000.

2086
01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:13.868
- [Poreshanella] Money?

2087
01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:15.669
- That's the best you've ever.

2088
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:16.637
- Yeah. For your ass.

2089
01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:17.772
- All right.

2090
01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.073
Mama Nella. I'm out. baby.

2091
01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:20.040
Always good to see you. - Okay sweetheart.

2092
01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.709
- Yeah.

2093
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:22.977
Neka. whatever you doing. baby.

2094
01:36:22.977 --> 01:36:24.011
they got you glowing this way.

2095
01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.045
- Wait. - Keep it going.

2096
01:36:25.045 --> 01:36:27.348
- Mommy. - And you too. Baby T.

2097
01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:31.919
Make sure you call. you hear me?

2098
01:36:38.025 --> 01:36:39.360
- Question.

2099
01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.028
When were you gonna tell me about Candace

2100
01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:43.631
being willing to do a DNA test?

2101
01:36:45.199 --> 01:36:47.835
- Tammy. I don't tell you anything that doesn't concern you.

2102
01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:51.372
- Well. you need mama to get it done. so it does concern me.

2103
01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:54.542
- I can look at the child and tell if she ours or not.

2104
01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:57.845
- We need the DNA test done before she has the baby.

2105
01:36:57.845 --> 01:37:00.147
and before she disappears again.

2106
01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:01.649
- Girl. fuck you.

2107
01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:04.151
- Did you not just hear me say I'm going to Brazil?

2108
01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:05.786
I'll take care of it when I get back.

2109
01:37:05.786 --> 01:37:08.823
- And who taking you to Brazil?

2110
01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:13.093
- I have a 27-hour flight. Please grab that luggage.

2111
01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:17.231
- All I know is if this baby is Terrance's.

2112
01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:18.799
I don't want my kid anywhere near her.

2113
01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:21.302
- Angel. please shut up.

2114
01:37:21.302 --> 01:37:24.138
- Tammy. have you been flying spirit with my luggage?

2115
01:37:24.138 --> 01:37:26.841
This is a 5.000 suitcase.

2116
01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:28.676
- Tameka. it's just a suitcase.

2117
01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:30.411
- So what? It's mine!

2118
01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:32.613
- Oh. well get another one.

2119
01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:34.982
You just bought Nel a $5.000 bag.

2120
01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:36.917
You got it Dr. Davis.

2121
01:37:36.917 --> 01:37:41.088
- Man. Ma. you sure know how to kill a moment.

2122
01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:43.424
- Chanel. I love you. Enjoy your birthday.

2123
01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:44.859
I'll text you when I get back.

2124
01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:47.595

2246
01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:24.198
I'm now responsible for teaching this procedure

2247
01:43:24.198 --> 01:43:26.567
to several residents.

2248
01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:28.936
That is 90% of my life.

2249
01:43:28.936 --> 01:43:32.172
- So you don't have the time?

2250
01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:34.007
- And so. you know if you do that. you off the board.

2258
01:44:10.477 --> 01:44:12.512
That's a lot for a woman who's in another country

2259
01:44:12.512 --> 01:44:14.848
and with another man.

2260
01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:15.682

- Okay. what about him?

2267
01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:34.534
- You removed a bullet two inches from his brain.

2268
01:44:34.534 --> 01:44:35.535
- Okay. and?

2269
01:44:37.504 --> 01:44:39.773
- I need the bullet.

2270
01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:41.441
- Are you crazy? No!

2271
01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:47.281
- I need it to solve my brother's case.

2272
01:44:47.281 --> 01:44:50.017
- Tammy. Terrance was sliced from ear to ear.

2273
01:44:50.017 --> 01:44:54.354
- I know. I know. But look. Terrance shot him. Drew.

2274
01:44:55.622 --> 01:44:57.858
Eddie left the scene to go throw away a gun.

2275
01:44:57.858 --> 01:45:00.360
he said supposedly had bodies on it.

2276
01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.561
I need to make sure that bullet

2277
01:45:01.561 --> 01:45:03.664
matches my brother's gun.

2278
01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:06.933
- Tommy. stop.

2279
01:45:06.933 --> 01:45:07.768
Hey.

2280
01:45:08.702 --> 01:45:11.004
Does Tameka know about this?

2281
01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:16.209
- Drew. you remember when we were kids?

2282
01:45:16.209 --> 01:45:18.745
You brought Tameka that bike.

2283
01:45:18.745 --> 01:45:21.181
My dad made her give it back.

2284
01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:24.451
And then for my birthday.

2285
01:45:24.451 --> 01:45:27.621
you got me a friends forever necklace.

2286
01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:33.360
He never said a thing. so I never took it off.

2287
01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:38.598
- You know what?

2288
01:45:38.598 --> 01:45:40.334
I'm starting to really believe that this whole family

2289
01:45:40.334 --> 01:45:42.336
has some mental illness.

2290
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:45.739
Tammy. That was elementary?

2291
01:45:49.843 --> 01:45:50.677
Listen.

2292
01:45:51.845 --> 01:45:55.615
Tameka says it's okay. I'll get you the bullet.

2293
01:45:57.951 --> 01:45:59.786
- Did she ask you for permission

2294
01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:02.189
to go to another country with another man?

2295
01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:03.590
She didn't. okay?

2296
01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:07.060
So while you standing here fighting temptation.

2297
01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:09.696

2298
01:46:09.696 --> 01:46:10.864
- Hey.

2299
01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:11.865
- Meanwhile.

2300
01:46:12.966 --> 01:46:15.635
she's fucking someone else in Brazil.

2301
01:46:15.635 --> 01:46:17.304
- Tammy. stop! Okay?

2302
01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:23.210
I need you to leave. Now.

2303
01:46:26.913 --> 01:46:27.748
- Okay.

2304
01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:30.317
- Yeah. okay.

2305
01:46:40.127 --> 01:46:40.961
- Babe.

2306
01:46:42.162 --> 01:46:43.764
What is all of this?

2307
01:46:43.764 --> 01:46:44.664
- Hey. bro.

2308
01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:47.634
I'm gonna get into all that later.

2309
01:46:47.634 --> 01:46:50.370
How was the convention?

2310
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:51.805
- It was amazing!

2311
01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:54.474
I mean. it was so many doctors from all over the world.

2312
01:46:54.474 --> 01:46:58.445
coming up with methods to discover and cure mental illness.

2313
01:46:58.445 --> 01:47:00.080
I wish you were there.

2314
01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.681
I mean. I appreciate that you stayed behind.

2315
01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:04.217
but you know if it wasn't for you.

2316
01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:06.553
I probably wouldn't be here?

2317
01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:11.091
- Look. I know all this is sudden.

2318
01:47:16.963 --> 01:47:17.898
I love you.

2319
01:47:23.103 --> 01:47:27.641
The moment I seen that smile. I said. you know what?

2320
01:47:27.641 --> 01:47:29.643
I gotta do that forever.

2321
01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:31.578
Brilliant.

2322
01:47:34.548 --> 01:47:35.382
Beautiful.

2323
01:47:36.983 --> 01:47:39.052
Boujee. Definitely corny.

2324
01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:43.256
I pray for God for you.

2325
01:47:45.892 --> 01:47:47.694
I wasn't too specific. but-

2326
01:47:47.694 --> 01:47:49.196
- Uh!

2327
01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:53.033
Never really believed in God or the whole praying thing

2328
01:47:53.033 --> 01:47:56.703
due to my upbringing and things I experienced.

2329
01:47:56.703 --> 01:47:59.606
But since you've came into my life.

2330
01:48:00.807 --> 01:48:03.944
I have opened my eyes to the impossible.

2331
01:48:03.944 --> 01:48:08.014
You make things happen for me. like all of this.

2332
01:48:08.014 --> 01:48:08.849
- Man.

2333
01:48:13.086 --> 01:48:13.920

01:48:16.356 --> 01:48:18.625

2404
01:51:53.073 --> 01:51:53.873
Hey Tammy.

2405
01:51:54.774 --> 01:51:56.076
Yeah. it's Drew.

2406
01:51:59.879 --> 01:52:01.181
I got the bullet.

2407
01:52:02.615 --> 01:52:06.086

2408
01:52:06.086 --> 01:52:08.588
(tense music)

2409
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:25.905
- Damn Tammy! You scared the shit out of me!

2410
01:52:25.905 --> 01:52:26.940
- Hi. - What you doing in here?

2411
01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:29.109
How you even get up in here?

2412
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:30.543
- The private pharmacy and labs

2413
01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:31.811
are close until she gets back.

2414
01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:34.314
so I needed results for a case.

2415
01:52:34.314 --> 01:52:36.149
She wasn't answering.

2416
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:39.486
- Your brother's case? The Candace girl.

2417
01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:41.254
- Right.

2418
01:52:42.689 --> 01:52:43.857
- Okay. well you better have the paperwork to prove it

2419
01:52:43.857 --> 01:52:45.058
when she get back. 'cause when she find out

2420
01:52:45.058 --> 01:52:47.794
she gonna either sue you or kill you.

2421
01:52:47.794 --> 01:52:49.462
We're all born to die. Amina.

2422
01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:50.730
Now if you'll excuse me.

2423
01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:53.700
I would like to solve this case before I do.

2424
01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:56.169
(tense music)

2425
01:53:11.217 --> 01:53:15.622
- And what you've done. before you come apologize.

2426
01:53:15.622 --> 01:53:19.225
make sure you get rid of that motherfucker.

2427
01:53:33.873 --> 01:53:36.476
- Walt. You're actually right on time.

2428
01:53:36.476 --> 01:53:38.244
I need you to do me a favor.

2429
01:53:38.244 --> 01:53:41.247
I need you to see if this bullet matches this gun.

2430
01:53:41.247 --> 01:53:42.749
- What?

2431
01:53:42.749 --> 01:53:45.084
You know that's damn near impossible. right?

2432
01:53:45.084 --> 01:53:48.054
It's possible. Walt. and I know you can get it done.

2433
01:53:48.054 --> 01:53:50.657
So here's the bullet.

2434
01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:53.293
Please. can you get it matched?

2435
01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:55.328
- How the hell did you even get this? Whose gun is this?

2436
01:53:55.328 --> 01:53:57.063
- Walt. please? Okay?

2437
01:53:58.231 --> 01:54:00.633
Why you always gotta ask me so many questions.

2438
01:54:00.633 --> 01:54:01.835
Can you please get it done?

2439
01:54:01.835 --> 01:54:05.672
I need it done today. now. immediately.

2440
01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:06.506
Please.

2441
01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:15.315
It's always a fight with this guy.

2442
01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:23.223
- It was amazing. Amina. I didn't even wanna come home.

2443
01:54:25.124 --> 01:54:28.461
I know. right. I think I love him.

2444
01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:29.395
Wait. what?

2445
01:54:30.930 --> 01:54:31.764
When?

2446
01:54:41.374 --> 01:54:43.042
It's gone. Anima. check the fridge and make sure

2447
01:54:43.042 --> 01:54:45.311
nothing is missing. please.

2448
01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:49.616
Fuck. Okay. I'll be there in a minute.

2449
01:54:51.117 --> 01:54:52.051
Shit. Drew.

2450
01:54:53.786 --> 01:54:55.288
You're scaring me.

2451
01:54:57.557 --> 01:54:59.659
- How was the convention?

2452
01:55:01.127 --> 01:55:02.295
- It was okay.

2453
01:55:03.196 --> 01:55:05.531
I mean did my speech. it was

2454
01:55:07.033 --> 01:55:08.034
pretty cool.

2455
01:55:09.636 --> 01:55:11.804
- Did Esson enjoy as well?

2456
01:55:16.376 --> 01:55:18.044
- Drew. - Don't Drew.

2457
01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:21.114
Did you have sex with him?

2458
01:55:33.159 --> 01:55:35.161
Did you fuck him or not?

2459
01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:40.033
Really Tameka?

2460
01:55:40.033 --> 01:55:42.635
(somber music)

2461
01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:48.741
Everything that I do is for you.

2462
01:55:52.412 --> 01:55:55.648
Nothing that I have done stands for us.

2463
01:55:57.417 --> 01:55:59.519
Not only are you selfish.

2464
01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:02.588
but you're mentally ill.

2465
01:56:03.456 --> 01:56:04.390
10th grade!

2466
01:56:05.591 --> 01:56:08.661
I got in a fight with one of my teammates

2467
01:56:08.661 --> 01:56:11.230
because I thought he liked you.

2468
01:56:12.131 --> 01:56:14.534
I thought he liked you.

2469
01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:18.037
so the whole team attacked me and Tammy.

2470
01:56:18.037 --> 01:56:19.806
and I fought him off.

2471
01:56:21.407 --> 01:56:26.412
Every successful thing that you have done has my name on it.

2472
01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.082
Me! I invested my entire life!

2473
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:33.720
My time. and not to mention the money.

2474
01:56:35.655 --> 01:56:37.590
You make it. I have it.

2475
01:56:40.226 --> 01:56:41.060
I have it.

2476
01:56:43.963 --> 01:56:48.368
So what I don't understand is why would you go

2477
01:56:48.368 --> 01:56:51.471
all the way to Brazil with a stranger

2478
01:56:52.872 --> 01:56:56.943
that you don't even know and give him your virginity.

2479
01:56:58.711 --> 01:56:59.946
Your virginity.

2480
01:57:01.514 --> 01:57:05.184
Something has to be mentally wrong with you.

2481
01:57:10.723 --> 01:57:12.225
Speechless. right?

2482
01:57:14.794 --> 01:57:16.229
Go ahead. Tameka.

2483
01:57:17.397 --> 01:57:19.332
Be a psychologist. huh?

2484
01:57:23.469 --> 01:57:25.038
Make it make sense.

2485
01:57:29.308 --> 01:57:32.145
(phone vibrating)

2486
01:57:35.114 --> 01:57:36.215
This is Drew.

2487
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:39.952
Look. I'm in the middle of something right now. okay?

2488
01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:42.021
Listen. I said...

2489
01:57:42.021 --> 01:57:42.855
What?

2490
01:57:47.493 --> 01:57:48.995
Send it to me now.

2491
01:57:58.638 --> 01:58:01.507
Please tell me you wore protection.

2492
01:58:05.411 --> 01:58:09.182
Tameka. Please tell me your protect yourself.

2493
01:58:13.619 --> 01:58:15.388
He's HIV positive. Tameka!

2494
01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:18.291
Please tell me you wore protection.

2495
01:58:19.425 --> 01:58:21.394
So what? You test her and not him. huh?

2496
01:58:21.394 --> 01:58:23.930
I tested them both! - Tested them both?

2497
01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:24.764
What?

2498
01:58:26.232 --> 01:58:28.367
Because she was in a clear. what. he thought he wasn't?

2499
01:58:28.367 --> 01:58:31.137
You waited 32 years to catch HIV?

2500
01:58:32.572 --> 01:58:35.241
You could have ruined life. You could ruined my life.

2501
01:58:35.241 --> 01:58:38.511
- You and me would have ruined your life. Drew!

2502
01:58:38.511 --> 01:58:39.445
- What you talking about?

2503
01:58:39.445 --> 01:58:41.781
- My life is already ruined.

2504
01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:42.615
- What?

2505
01:58:44.784 --> 01:58:47.887
- I didn't wait 32 years to possibly catch HIV.

2506
01:58:47.887 --> 01:58:49.489
I was born with it!

2507
01:58:50.389 --> 01:58:52.592
- What are you talking about?

2508
01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:55.995
- Tameka and Terrance. It's my fault.

2509
01:58:55.995 --> 01:58:58.164
- Drew. you're perfect.

2510
01:58:58.164 --> 01:59:00.500
I mean. what woman wouldn't want you?

2511
01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:04.871
You're successful and charming. and honest and loyal.

2512
01:59:07.039 --> 01:59:09.942
And I love you enough to never do to you

2513
01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:12.245
what my mother did to me.

2514
01:59:12.245 --> 01:59:14.747
I was born this way. remember?

2515
01:59:16.015 --> 01:59:19.051
She's the reason I have a mental illness.

2516
01:59:19.051 --> 01:59:21.220
and that's why I hate her.

2517
01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:26.893
Tammy was born in the clear and she still chooses

2518
01:59:26.893 --> 01:59:31.130
to walk around and fuck anything that breathes air.

2519
01:59:32.298 --> 01:59:35.935
Yet. she's still walking around mad and bitter

2520
01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:42.041
that my father showed me a little bit more attention.

2521
01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:43.609
It was the guilt!

2522
01:59:45.611 --> 01:59:47.346
It was the guilt of them bringing me

2523
01:59:47.346 --> 01:59:49.315
into this world infected.

2524
01:59:49.315 --> 01:59:52.552
because of the lifestyle that they chose.

2525
01:59:52.552 --> 01:59:54.520
So it's not jealousy with Tammy.

2526
01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:57.023
I just don't fucking like her.

2527
01:59:59.492 --> 02:00:03.829
She was born in the clear and she still wanted more.

2528
02:00:05.698 --> 02:00:10.703
This entire family from my mother to Tammy is mentally ill.

2529
02:00:11.837 --> 02:00:13.706
and that's why I live the way I live

2530
02:00:13.706 --> 02:00:16.175
and make the decisions that I make

2531
02:00:16.175 --> 02:00:19.011
and choose the people that I choose.

2532
02:00:19.011 --> 02:00:21.280
Every decision that I make to me is wise.

2533
02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.716
because I never had a choice.

2534
02:00:29.055 --> 02:00:31.057
Drew. you are my person.

2535
02:00:32.658 --> 02:00:35.061
You will always be my person.

2536
02:00:37.863 --> 02:00:38.698
God.

2537
02:00:41.667 --> 02:00:43.736
But Esson is my soulmate.

2538
02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:45.571
- What?

2539
02:00:48.541 --> 02:00:51.944
- And you deserve. you deserve happiness.

2540
02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:55.481
- Happiness?

2541
02:01:01.587 --> 02:01:02.421
Wow.

2542
02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:37.490
(phone ringing)

2543
02:01:39.525 --> 02:01:40.926
- [Walt] Everything's a match.

2544
02:01:40.926 --> 02:01:42.128
The bullet is from this gun.

2545
02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:44.430
but what does this have to do with the case?

2546
02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:45.898
Terrance was cut from ear to ear.

2547
02:01:45.898 --> 02:01:47.166
- Okay.

2548
02:01:47.166 --> 02:01:49.268
Walt. bring me the gun and the bullet.

2549
02:01:49.268 --> 02:01:52.371
I gotta go. okay? Can you please bring it to me?

2550
02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:53.172
Thank you.

2551
02:01:57.143 --> 02:01:59.945
(phone vibrating)

2552
02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:02.848
- Uh-uh. what's your fake ass want?

2553
02:02:02.848 --> 02:02:05.117
- You didn't wear it. did you.

2554
02:02:05.117 --> 02:02:06.986
- Bitch. are you slow?

2555
02:02:06.986 --> 02:02:08.154
I would never. okay?

2556
02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:09.755
And it's probably not even real.

2557
02:02:09.755 --> 02:02:11.090
- Okay. perfect.

2558
02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:14.760
I need you to bring it to me.

2559
02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:19.699
I'll pay you 1K if you can get here in the next 10 minutes.

2560
02:02:21.167 --> 02:02:24.070
- Girl. I got here as fast as I could. here.

2561
02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:25.805
- Thank you. - Uh-huh.

2562
02:02:28.574 --> 02:02:29.675
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2563
02:02:29.675 --> 02:02:31.811
Thank you so much. - Yeah.

2564
02:02:35.448 --> 02:02:37.183
- Now. what the fuck is so urgent?

2565
02:02:37.183 --> 02:02:39.018
- Angel. go.

2566
02:02:39.018 --> 02:02:41.654
No. No questions asked. remember?

2567
02:02:41.654 --> 02:02:42.488
Thank you.

2568
02:02:45.925 --> 02:02:46.759
Come here.

2569
02:02:50.529 --> 02:02:53.099
- Now. who the fuck is that?

2570
02:02:53.099 --> 02:02:57.169
- I don't know. but I know she killed my brother.

2571
02:03:01.107 --> 02:03:03.576
- You want an explanation?

2572
02:03:03.576 --> 02:03:04.577
- Of course.

2573
02:03:05.678 --> 02:03:09.181
Might make me feel better after I kill her.

2574
02:03:10.349 --> 02:03:12.852
(tense music)

2575
02:03:19.992 --> 02:03:21.594
That's her address.

2576
02:03:22.995 --> 02:03:26.399
I gotta go change cars. but meet me over there around 8:00.

2577
02:03:26.399 --> 02:03:29.435
- Yeah. all right. I gotta change my car too.

2578
02:03:29.435 --> 02:03:30.803
So we on it.

2579
02:03:30.803 --> 02:03:33.305
(tense music)

2580
02:03:57.930 --> 02:03:58.764
Yeah.

2581
02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:04.503
Listen Tammy. go ahead. But if you ain't out in 10 minutes.

2582
02:04:04.503 --> 02:04:07.273
I'm coming in that mother fucker.

2583
02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:10.476
All right.

2584
02:04:12.678 --> 02:04:15.681
(frightening music)

2585
02:04:17.183 --> 02:04:19.952
(Eddie coughing)

2586
02:04:23.956 --> 02:04:26.459
(tense music)

2587
02:05:01.026 --> 02:05:03.529
- Jaynaye. I'm telling you. he's cheating on me.

2588
02:05:03.529 --> 02:05:04.697
At first I thought it was the nurse.

2589
02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:06.699
but no. it's the doctor.

2590
02:05:07.833 --> 02:05:10.836
(indistinct)

2591
02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.338
- Dr. Davis?

2592
02:05:12.338 --> 02:05:15.407
I wouldn't have never thought she'd date a hood nigga.

2593
02:05:15.407 --> 02:05:16.942
But look. you gotta calm down.

2594
02:05:16.942 --> 02:05:20.012
I'm on my way. as soon as I leave this store.

2595
02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:22.648
B. I gotta go. My girl have a nigga problem.

2596
02:05:22.648 --> 02:05:23.782
I'm out. - Okay.

2597
02:05:23.782 --> 02:05:25.017
Ain't she always?

2598
02:05:25.017 --> 02:05:26.519
- Yeah. I think I'ma head out too.

2599
02:05:26.519 --> 02:05:29.588
The baby's kicking like crazy and it's time to go to bed.

2600
02:05:29.588 --> 02:05:30.489
- Okay. - Okay.

2601
02:05:30.489 --> 02:05:31.924
- I understand. - I know.

2602
02:05:31.924 --> 02:05:33.225
- See you baby! - I gotta go. I gotta go.

2603
02:05:33.225 --> 02:05:34.326
Okay? - Bye baby!

2604
02:05:34.326 --> 02:05:35.728
- Yeah! Put that down.

2605
02:05:35.728 --> 02:05:36.729
- It's cute.

2606
02:05:49.208 --> 02:05:52.978
- You know who I am so you know why I'm here.

2607
02:05:54.079 --> 02:05:55.247
- Tammy Davis.

2608
02:05:56.181 --> 02:05:58.317
I don't know why you in my house.

2609
02:05:58.317 --> 02:06:01.053
but you better shoot me. 'cause if you don't.

2610
02:06:01.053 --> 02:06:03.255
I'm gonna kill your sisters and you

2611
02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:05.257
the same way I killed Terrance.

2612
02:06:05.257 --> 02:06:06.859
With my bare hands.

2613
02:06:07.893 --> 02:06:08.727
- Okay.

2614
02:06:12.665 --> 02:06:15.401
(women grunting)

2615
02:06:16.368 --> 02:06:18.037
Why did you kill my brother?

2616
02:06:18.037 --> 02:06:20.205
But no one take your life.

2617
02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:26.111
- Bitch. your brother tried to kill me when he gave me HIV.

2618
02:06:26.111 --> 02:06:27.947
I didn't wanna be his wife. that was Candace.

2619
02:06:27.947 --> 02:06:30.049
He even fucked with me just to ruin my life.

2620
02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:32.451
So now I'm killing everybody!

2621
02:06:42.695 --> 02:06:44.530
(indistinct)

2622
02:06:44.530 --> 02:06:48.434
- She killed him! She just said she killed him!

2623
02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:53.739
I followed her here.

2624
02:06:54.974 --> 02:06:56.241
- Don't move.

2625
02:06:56.241 --> 02:06:57.676
- Just kill me.

2626
02:06:57.676 --> 02:07:01.280
I have HIV. A baby with no father!

2627
02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:02.348
Just kill me!

2628
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:05.818
- I don't know what-

2629
02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:08.420
- Freeze. police! - I just got here.

2630
02:07:09.955 --> 02:07:11.457
- Did you do this?

2631
02:07:16.595 --> 02:07:18.931
Go outside. wait please. Go!

2632
02:07:21.433 --> 02:07:23.369
- Okay. - No. no!

2633
02:07:23.369 --> 02:07:24.370
My baby! No!

2634
02:07:26.205 --> 02:07:27.806
No. my baby!

2635
02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:29.074
- Look at me. look at me. look at me.

2636
02:07:29.074 --> 02:07:30.876
Look at me. look at me. look at me. look at me.

2637
02:07:30.876 --> 02:07:33.646
Okay. I need you to go take the car inside of the house.

2638
02:07:33.646 --> 02:07:35.447
Take this knife. Take it.

2639
02:07:35.447 --> 02:07:36.882
Look. Look at me.

2640
02:07:36.882 --> 02:07:39.084
Take the knife. go where Terrance take you. okay?

2641
02:07:39.084 --> 02:07:40.252
Okay? - Go! Go!

2642
02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:43.622
(tense music)

2643
02:07:58.070 --> 02:08:00.039
- [Officer] What do we got. Walt?

2644
02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:01.707
- Another ear to ear.

2645
02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:04.376
No signs of forced entry or rape.

2646
02:08:04.376 --> 02:08:06.712
This young lady found her.

2647
02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:08.147
- And you were responding to the dead body

2648
02:08:08.147 --> 02:08:11.917
on Dexter. correct? - Yes. and ran into this.

2649
02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:15.587
- No bodies. no car.

2650
02:08:17.456 --> 02:08:19.458
No weapon. I got nothing.

2651
02:08:19.458 --> 02:08:21.060
- Hmm.

2652
02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:24.863
So the body was like this when you found it?

2653
02:08:24.863 --> 02:08:25.898
- Yes.

2654
02:08:25.898 --> 02:08:28.834
Her. Candace and some other lady.

2655
02:08:28.834 --> 02:08:31.303
- Are you telling us that there was two other women here

2656
02:08:31.303 --> 02:08:33.539
before I arrived?

2657
02:08:33.539 --> 02:08:34.973
- Yes!

2658
02:08:34.973 --> 02:08:37.042
You was just here. I was just here.

2659
02:08:37.042 --> 02:08:38.777
We all was just here.

2660
02:08:38.777 --> 02:08:41.447
Somebody killed my best friend. it had to be Candace.

2661
02:08:41.447 --> 02:08:42.981
'cause she followed me here.

2662
02:08:42.981 --> 02:08:46.685
- Right. Jaynaye Foster. That is you. correct?

2663
02:08:46.685 --> 02:08:48.554
- [Jaynaye] Yes. that's me!

2664
02:08:48.554 --> 02:08:50.522
- You called 9-1-1.

2665
02:08:50.522 --> 02:08:51.890
saying that there was a dead body found

2666
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:53.726
on the side of the house.

2667
02:08:53.726 --> 02:08:57.162
And we arrived and we found the body.

2668
02:08:57.162 --> 02:08:59.665
and now you're here in front of your friend

2669
02:08:59.665 --> 02:09:01.333
with no murder weapon.

2670
02:09:01.333 --> 02:09:02.601
And you're saying that the killer was here and left.

2671
02:09:02.601 --> 02:09:03.469
is that correct?

2672
02:09:03.469 --> 02:09:04.937
- Yes!

2673
02:09:04.937 --> 02:09:06.839
- Oh. right. right. okay. so you set this up.

2674
02:09:06.839 --> 02:09:07.873
Is that what you're saying?

2675
02:09:07.873 --> 02:09:09.374
- I didn't set shit...

2676
02:09:09.374 --> 02:09:11.376
No. I didn't! - Look. look. look. look.

2677
02:09:11.376 --> 02:09:13.812
Let me get this right Ms. Foster.

2678
02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:15.848
So there's no car outside.

2679
02:09:15.848 --> 02:09:17.616
- [Jaynaye] Oh my God. I can't believe this.

2680
02:09:17.616 --> 02:09:21.920
- Candace disappeared. The body disappeared.

2681
02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:24.957
and so did the murder weapon. correct?

2682
02:09:24.957 --> 02:09:28.994
- Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying.

2683
02:09:28.994 --> 02:09:29.828
- Wow.

2684
02:09:38.303 --> 02:09:40.139
- Hey babe. what's up?

2685
02:09:42.107 --> 02:09:45.277
Of course not. never too busy for you.

2686
02:09:46.512 --> 02:09:48.113
Babe. what's wrong?

2687
02:09:51.083 --> 02:09:52.317
Okay. I'm here.

2688
02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:56.221
Yeah. I'll be here.

2689
02:09:58.524 --> 02:09:59.792
- What's wrong?

2690
02:10:00.826 --> 02:10:03.028
- One of my patients.

2691
02:10:03.028 --> 02:10:04.363
- What happened?

2692
02:10:06.832 --> 02:10:07.900
- She's dead.

2693
02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:21.280
- The police found her slit ear to ear.

2694
02:10:23.215 --> 02:10:24.416
- That's crazy.

2695
02:10:24.416 --> 02:10:26.084
That's how my uncle.

2696
02:10:32.457 --> 02:10:36.361
- Police are holding her friend Jaynaye now for questioning.

2697
02:10:36.361 --> 02:10:38.297
She was on the scene.

2698
02:10:38.297 --> 02:10:39.932
They're not letting me talk to her.

2699
02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:42.467
so I sent the lawyer down.

2700
02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:45.504
Supposed to be calling me any minute.

2701
02:10:46.705 --> 02:10:49.775
So what is it you want to talk to me about?

2702
02:10:49.775 --> 02:10:51.076
- Well. it can wait. babe.

2703
02:10:51.076 --> 02:10:53.946
Let's just focus on you right now. okay?

2704
02:10:53.946 --> 02:10:54.980
(phone vibrating)

2705
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:57.616
- Speaking of which. here we go.

2706
02:11:00.819 --> 02:11:01.620
Hello?

2707
02:11:04.256 --> 02:11:05.691
Yeah. I can talk.

2708
02:11:09.428 --> 02:11:12.164
Tammy? Nah. I don't know a Tammy.

2709
02:11:15.167 --> 02:11:16.001
Frame her?

2710
02:11:19.137 --> 02:11:21.373
- I'll be down. don't trip.

2711
02:11:22.541 --> 02:11:23.642
All right. look man.

2712
02:11:23.642 --> 02:11:24.476
Nah.

2713
02:11:26.511 --> 02:11:27.779
I want you by my side.

2714
02:11:27.779 --> 02:11:31.416
but it's just gonna be more drama right now.

2715
02:11:31.416 --> 02:11:33.051
You feeling me?

2716
02:11:33.051 --> 02:11:35.320
- I understand. - All right.

2717
02:11:36.788 --> 02:11:38.223
I'll be back a little later.

2718
02:11:38.223 --> 02:11:39.992
- Okay. I'll be here.

2719
02:11:41.126 --> 02:11:42.060
I love you.

2720
02:11:50.502 --> 02:11:52.037
This fucking bitch!

2721
02:11:54.339 --> 02:11:57.809
She's so fucking stupid. Why would she do that?

2722
02:11:57.809 --> 02:11:58.610
Oh my God!

2723
02:12:00.812 --> 02:12:03.882
Go and get her. I'm gonna go get her.

2724
02:12:12.090 --> 02:12:14.259
(door slamming)

2725
02:12:14.259 --> 02:12:16.762
(tense music)

2726
02:12:20.699 --> 02:12:21.533
- Shit.

2727
02:12:27.172 --> 02:12:29.975
- Crazy? Bitch. I'll show you crazy!

2728
02:12:29.975 --> 02:12:33.178
You stole blood work from my office and gave it to Drew?

2729
02:12:33.178 --> 02:12:37.249
And then you killed my fucking patient!

2730
02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:39.551
- She killed Terrance.

2731
02:12:39.551 --> 02:12:41.920
- What? - She killed Terrance!

2732
02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.121
- So you killed her?

2733
02:12:43.121 --> 02:12:46.291
- [Tammy] I ain't kill her! Candace did!

2734
02:12:49.127 --> 02:12:50.462
- [Chanel] Stop!

2735
02:12:51.663 --> 02:12:53.932
- You should have told him the truth. Tameka.

2736
02:12:53.932 --> 02:12:56.635
Just like Terrance should have told Krystal the truth.

2737
02:12:56.635 --> 02:12:59.104
- Tammy. who the hell do you think you are

2738
02:12:59.104 --> 02:13:01.206
to tell my truth?

2739
02:13:01.206 --> 02:13:03.575
Your entire life is lies!

2740
02:13:03.575 --> 02:13:06.078
Stop it! Both of you!

2741
02:13:06.078 --> 02:13:08.180
You all are living a lie!

2742
02:13:09.648 --> 02:13:11.984
You know. if you wanna blame somebody for it. then fine.

2743
02:13:11.984 --> 02:13:13.885
point the finger at me!

2744
02:13:16.655 --> 02:13:18.156
Tameka. I'm sorry.

2745
02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:26.365
Okay. you may never forgive me. but I am truly sorry.

2746
02:13:27.499 --> 02:13:29.601
Yes. I could have never had children. okay?

2747
02:13:29.601 --> 02:13:33.038
But you were your father's dream child.

2748
02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:35.474
and the doctors told me you would fine.

2749
02:13:35.474 --> 02:13:36.308
- [Tammy] Dream child.

2750
02:13:36.308 --> 02:13:38.510
- And you are fine!

2751
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:41.413
Tameka. look at you. baby. You're great!

2752
02:13:41.413 --> 02:13:44.349
You don't need me to tell you that.

2753
02:13:46.885 --> 02:13:47.719
Tammy.

2754
02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:51.790
My only healthy seven pound baby girl.

2755
02:13:54.459 --> 02:13:58.630
You were always so smart and absolutely beautiful.

2756
02:14:00.532 --> 02:14:02.401
We gave you everything.

2757
02:14:04.603 --> 02:14:07.606
and it still was never enough. baby.

2758
02:14:09.007 --> 02:14:12.711
You have struggled with needing attention all of your life.

2759
02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:15.447
Even when you were a little girl.

2760
02:14:20.018 --> 02:14:23.722
Mike Davis probably wasn't even my daddy.

2761
02:14:23.722 --> 02:14:25.657
He used to look at me like he wanted to fuck me.

2762
02:14:25.657 --> 02:14:27.359
- Tammy! Stop lying like that!

2763
02:14:27.359 --> 02:14:30.862
- Hey! Can we all just be honest for once?

2764
02:14:33.298 --> 02:14:35.333
That man is probably rolling over in his grave.

2765
02:14:35.333 --> 02:14:38.036
thinking about you lying like that.

2766
02:14:38.036 --> 02:14:38.870
- Mom.

2767
02:14:40.238 --> 02:14:42.741
You killed Esson's girlfriend?

2768
02:14:45.644 --> 02:14:46.478
Mom?

2769
02:14:47.813 --> 02:14:52.451
- Baby. she killed Terrance. She told me herself!

2770
02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:56.421
And you and I was next. so thank me. bitch.

2771
02:14:56.421 --> 02:14:59.257
'cause she was gonna kill you too.

2772
02:15:00.692 --> 02:15:03.495
Apparently. Terrance gave her HIV.

2773
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:06.731
and she gave it to her boyfriend.

2774
02:15:06.731 --> 02:15:10.168
which I'm assuming is Tameka's boyfriend.

2775
02:15:14.039 --> 02:15:16.708
(door knocking)

2776
02:15:23.515 --> 02:15:24.916
- Hey babe. - Hey.

2777
02:15:26.151 --> 02:15:28.086
What's going on?

2778
02:15:28.086 --> 02:15:29.087
- [Tameka] How are you?

2779
02:15:29.087 --> 02:15:30.422
- I'm good. how are you?

2780
02:15:30.422 --> 02:15:31.957
- Good! We need to talk.

2781
02:15:31.957 --> 02:15:33.959
- [Esson] Talk about what? I don't wanna talk.

2782
02:15:33.959 --> 02:15:34.793
- Babe.

2783
02:15:36.261 --> 02:15:38.196
We really need to talk.

2784
02:15:42.601 --> 02:15:44.236
- Talk. talk. Let's talk.

2785
02:15:44.236 --> 02:15:46.738
(tense music)

2786
02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:51.776
Talk babe. what's up?

2787
02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:54.279
(tense music)

2788
02:15:57.449 --> 02:15:58.283
- We...

2789
02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:05.724
We're HIV positive.

2790
02:16:07.025 --> 02:16:09.661
But wait. just hear me out.

2791
02:16:09.661 --> 02:16:14.132
because you had it before you slept with me.

2792
02:16:14.132 --> 02:16:16.768
I didn't give it to you. Krystal did.

2793
02:16:16.768 --> 02:16:20.839
and my brother gave it to her. so she killed him.

2794
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:28.013
I had no idea that she was dating my brother.

2795
02:16:28.013 --> 02:16:28.847
but I.

2796
02:16:31.416 --> 02:16:32.817
I did know when I tested you both

2797
02:16:32.817 --> 02:16:35.153
that you both were positive.

2798
02:16:38.557 --> 02:16:40.225
But I was born with it.

2799
02:16:40.225 --> 02:16:42.827
And then in Brazil when you said

2800
02:16:42.827 --> 02:16:44.763
that you prayed for me.

2801
02:16:46.598 --> 02:16:48.433
I thought this was it.

2802
02:16:53.205 --> 02:16:55.774
Today I discovered that my sister went to kill Krystal.

2803
02:16:55.774 --> 02:16:57.175
but she couldn't.

2804
02:16:58.276 --> 02:16:59.544
so Candace did.

2805
02:17:01.446 --> 02:17:02.914
And I'm telling you all this.

2806
02:17:02.914 --> 02:17:04.916
'cause we been honest since day one.

2807
02:17:04.916 --> 02:17:09.921
And I was gonna tell you everything. I just didn't know how.

2808
02:17:14.559 --> 02:17:16.561
E. please say something.

2809
02:17:19.864 --> 02:17:22.033
- Who the fuck is Candace?

2810
02:17:23.235 --> 02:17:26.671
- [Tameka] Another one of my patients

2811
02:17:26.671 --> 02:17:29.507
that my brother was sleeping with.

2812
02:17:33.712 --> 02:17:35.480
- She killed Keystal.

2813
02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:40.885
because your sister couldn't.

2814
02:17:42.087 --> 02:17:45.724
- That's what my sister said. and I believe her.

2815
02:17:47.826 --> 02:17:51.363
I swear. I was gonna tell you about this.

2816
02:17:51.363 --> 02:17:53.265
I just didn't know how!

2817
02:17:57.302 --> 02:17:59.537
- Let me get this straight.

2818
02:18:04.609 --> 02:18:08.580
You even had me take your monkey ass to Brazil. huh?

2819
02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:11.182
Knowing you had this shit. huh?

2820
02:18:17.122 --> 02:18:20.125
- I swear to God. I never intentionally meant to hurt you.

2821
02:18:20.125 --> 02:18:22.961
She was gonna kill the both of us.

2822
02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:27.532
She found out. and I swear to God.

2823
02:18:27.532 --> 02:18:31.069
I would never intentionally hurt you.

2824
02:18:31.069 --> 02:18:33.738
I was gonna tell you everything.

2825
02:18:37.275 --> 02:18:38.877
I just didn't know.

2826
02:18:47.218 --> 02:18:48.186
No!

2827
02:18:48.186 --> 02:18:49.754
