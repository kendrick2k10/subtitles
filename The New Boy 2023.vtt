who joined us last night.

58
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.267
I'm sure you've all met him.

59
00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:44.367
show him the ways of our
little family and welcome him

60
00:17:44.367 --> 00:17:47.133

So.

63
00:17:58.333 --> 00:18:01.833

65
00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:06.600

Yep. you've got to bend over it.
That's right.

70
00:18:19.033 --> 00:18:20.467
Good boy.

71
00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:24.500
Dear Lord.

72
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.467
I present this lost boy to you

73
00:18:27.467 --> 00:18:30.500
so that he may be baptised
and join your flock.

74
00:18:33.067 --> 00:18:34.533
May the water

75
00:18:34.533 --> 00:18:36.400

76
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.200

You're a good boy.
You look after yourself.

93

Ah. the little new one.

106
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.633
Every kid here
calls me Sister Mum.

107
00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:24.300
'cause they don't have a mum.

108
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.900
And if you ain't got one.

109
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.367
you can call me
Sister Mum too. okay?

110
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.733
Hmm.

111
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.000
Alright. now George is here.

112
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.233
John?

113
00:22:50.233 --> 00:22:52.933
Would you please
bless our meal one last time?

114
00:22:55.167 --> 00:22:56.633
Yes. Sister.

115
00:23:03.333 --> 00:23:05.000
Dear Lord.

116
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.733

we beseech thee
a safe journey.

122
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.433
so that under thy guidance and
the guidance of the holy angels.

123
00:23:35.433 --> 00:23:38.100
we may safely reach
our destination.

124

and protect us from evil.

126
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.467
In the name of the
Father and the Son...

00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:50.500
In the name of the Father.
of the Son and the Holy Spirit.

129
00:24:01.233 --> 00:24:03.067
Will you write to us. John?

130
00:24:04.333 --> 00:24:06.900
Look forward to hearing
of your progress.

131
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.500
And these.
these are your papers.

132
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.200
- Keep them safe. you hear?
- Yes. Sister.

133
00:24:13.367 --> 00:24:14.733
Ohh!

134
00:24:14.733 --> 00:24:16.867
Look. it's a miracle.

135
00:24:16.867 --> 00:24:18.367
It's a shilling.

136
00:24:18.367 --> 00:24:20.800
Just in case.

137
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.633
Thank you. Sister.

138
00:24:24.733 --> 00:24:26.267
Be a good boy.

139
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.233
Ah...

140
00:24:57.933 --> 00:25:01.167
Don't get too excited.
There's no knife in it.

141
00:25:15.967 --> 00:25:18.633
Bye. Johnny.

142
00:25:47.467 --> 00:25:49.733
Just don't worry. children.

143
00:25:49.733 --> 00:25:52.233
With Michael here.

144
00:25:52.233 --> 00:25:54.333
as our new head boy.

145
00:25:54.333 --> 00:25:57.867
you know we're going
to be in safe hands.

146
00:25:57.867 --> 00:26:01.767
Hey. Sister Mum.
might we have a cake tonight?

147
00:26:01.767 --> 00:26:05.633
In honour of Michael's big day.
What do you reckon. boys?

148
00:26:05.633 --> 00:26:09.600
- Rum and raisin? Eh?
-  Yes. please. Sister.

149
00:26:37.867 --> 00:26:39.633
Hurry up.

150
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.167
Do your bed.

151
00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:45.000
And make sure you
do my bed as well.

152
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.333
Okay.

153
00:27:06.067 --> 00:27:09.467
Ahh.
Morning. Dom Peter.

154
00:27:09.467 --> 00:27:12.067
It's a lovely day.

155
00:27:13.467 --> 00:27:17.367
Anyway. I told a lie
to a policeman.

156
00:27:18.167 --> 00:27:20.200
Well...

157
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.800
...picked a fight. actually.

158
00:27:23.533 --> 00:27:24.967
And. um...

159
00:27:30.667 --> 00:27:32.733
Well. all the children are well.

160
00:27:32.733 --> 00:27:34.867
And as you can see.

161
00:27:34.867 --> 00:27:38.100
we got a new one
last night. so...

162
00:27:39.267 --> 00:27:40.567
Ahh...

163
00:27:40.567 --> 00:27:42.067
Yeah...

164
00:27:42.067 --> 00:27:44.400
Wow!

165
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.833
What a difference
a year makes. hey?

166
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.267
Anyway. um...

167
00:27:51.267 --> 00:27:53.633
Yeah. come on. son.
There's nothing to see here.

168
00:27:57.767 --> 00:28:00.833
Yeah.
and I baptised Johnny.

169
00:28:02.567 --> 00:28:05.600
I'm not sure if it worked.
I know it's a priest thing.

170
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.900
not a nun thing.

171
00:28:11.833 --> 00:28:14.600
Oi! Careful!

172
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.000
It's a year to the day.
you know?

173
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.400
Since he died.

174
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.800
Swearing at us
while we wiped his bum.

175
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.433
Yeah. Well. we haven't been
struck down by lightning. yet.

176
00:28:31.433 --> 00:28:33.100
I think the Lord might be

177
00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.667
alright with our
little arrangement.

178
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.733
- Hmm?
- They'll find out.

179
00:28:38.733 --> 00:28:41.133
We will be punished.

180
00:28:41.133 --> 00:28:43.367
- And they'll send another one.
- It doesn't matter to them.

181
00:28:43.367 --> 00:28:46.200
As long as we send
the profit from the harvest.

182
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.600
The Lord will protect us. Sister.

183
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.933
Where's that new boy gone?

184
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.033
There he is.
Hugging a tree.

185
00:28:56.033 --> 00:28:59.067
Oi! Hey. cut it out.

186
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.267
Come on. Come on.

187
00:29:03.267 --> 00:29:06.100
Now. you'll break your arm. eh?

188
00:30:15.167 --> 00:30:17.367
Go on.

189
00:30:17.367 --> 00:30:19.733
Go play with the other boys.

190
00:30:31.033 --> 00:30:32.767
"To the Chief Protector

191
00:30:32.767 --> 00:30:34.567
"of Aborigines. Mr Krank.

192
00:30:36.633 --> 00:30:40.667
"The boy John has been sent to
work on Dermott Downs Station.

193
00:30:42.267 --> 00:30:44.167
"While I appreciate that the war

194
00:30:44.167 --> 00:30:47.300
"has left many farms
light-handed.

195
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.267
"the boy's education will suffer

196
00:30:49.267 --> 00:30:53.333
"as a result of this premature
induction into the workforce.

197
00:30:53.333 --> 00:30:58.000
"After all. John is
only a boy of 13.

198
00:31:02.433 --> 00:31:04.867
"I trust you will see
God's wisdom in this.

199

"Yours sincerely.

"Dom Peter."

201
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.100
Sit back down.

202
00:32:58.133 --> 00:32:59.433
Uh-oh!

203
00:32:59.433 --> 00:33:01.667
George will have
something to say about that.

204
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.633
Oi. darkie!

205
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.800
Matthew says
he wants to fight you.

206
00:33:26.767 --> 00:33:28.467
Yeah. I'm going to
give it to you.

207
00:33:28.467 --> 00:33:31.067
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

208
00:33:31.067 --> 00:33:34.500
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

209
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.267
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

210
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.333
- You got him. Matty.

211
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.033
Good morning. my sons!

212
00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:39.567
Ohhh. It's hot in here.

213
00:34:39.567 --> 00:34:41.300
Michael?

214
00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:53.033
What's going on here?

215
00:34:54.367 --> 00:34:55.500
Michael?

216
00:35:00.033 --> 00:35:02.333
Oh. come on.
He's so small. and he's not.

217
00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:03.767
Sister. last night.

218
00:35:03.767 --> 00:35:05.500
I caught Matthew here
stealing food.

219
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.633
- And this was his punishment?
- No.

220
00:35:08.633 --> 00:35:10.167
No?

221
00:35:11.233 --> 00:35:12.700
Well...

222
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.233
You're head boy. now.

223
00:35:14.233 --> 00:35:16.300
So what should
his punishment be?

224
00:35:18.033 --> 00:35:20.800
-  Caning.
-  Caning?

225
00:35:24.667 --> 00:35:27.800
We haven't caned a boy
in over a year.

226
00:35:32.167 --> 00:35:34.100
Is that what you really want?

227
00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:37.800
Michael. being head boy

228
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.100
brings with it a
certain amount of power.

229
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.667
But it will also
bring you challenges.

230
00:35:43.667 --> 00:35:46.700
It is times like this that the
Devil will test you. Michael.

231
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.300
- You understand?
- Yes. Sister.

232
00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.633
Alright.

233
00:35:50.633 --> 00:35:53.900
I'll leave the decision
between you and God.

234
00:36:10.467 --> 00:36:12.200
-  Ow!

235
00:36:16.567 --> 00:36:18.167
Cut it out!

236
00:36:20.567 --> 00:36:23.100
Come on. that's enough.

237
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.533
Now get ready for church.

238
00:36:25.533 --> 00:36:27.667
Go on. go wash up.

239
00:36:27.667 --> 00:36:29.467
Come on. go wash up.

240
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.867
Matthew. come on.

241
00:36:33.867 --> 00:36:36.000
Matthew!

242
00:38:06.433 --> 00:38:09.467
Give us this day
our daily bread.

243
00:38:09.467 --> 00:38:10.967
And forgive us our trespasses.

244
00:38:10.967 --> 00:38:14.267
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

245
00:38:14.267 --> 00:38:18.400
And lead us not into temptation.
but deliver us from evil.

246
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.733
Again.

247
00:38:19.733 --> 00:38:22.333
Our Father
who art in heaven.

248
00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:24.733
hallowed be thy name.

249
00:38:24.733 --> 00:38:26.100
Thy Kingdom come.

250
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:29.933
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

251
00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:33.000
Give us this day
our daily bread.

252
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.300
And forgive us our trespasses.

253
00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.800
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

254
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.033
And lead us not into temptation.

255
00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:42.567
but deliver us from evil.

256
00:38:42.567 --> 00:38:44.067
...deliver us from evil.

257
00:38:44.067 --> 00:38:46.100
-  Amen.
-  Amen.

258
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.500
Hey.

259
00:38:58.167 --> 00:39:00.500
Steven. he gets two scoops.

260
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.033
- Oh! He gets two scoops.
- I know.

261
00:39:41.167 --> 00:39:43.133
So what happened this morning?

262
00:39:43.133 --> 00:39:45.967
Hmm? Oh.

263
00:39:45.967 --> 00:39:48.667
I think it's called
'the pecking order'.

264
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.133
Ah. they'll sort it out.

265
00:39:58.133 --> 00:40:00.133
Now.

266
00:40:00.133 --> 00:40:02.233
as you know...

267
00:40:03.333 --> 00:40:08.400
...today is the first day
of the olive harvest.

268
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.067
And George
will be here to help.

269
00:40:12.067 --> 00:40:13.833
Now.

270
00:40:13.833 --> 00:40:16.033
many of you were
here last year.

271
00:40:16.033 --> 00:40:20.133
so you're expected to teach
those children who weren't.

272
00:40:20.133 --> 00:40:22.567
how the harvest works.

273
00:40:24.867 --> 00:40:28.800
Now. in our little family.

274
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.767
everyone contributes.

275
00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:38.167
When we take pride
in our work.

276
00:40:38.167 --> 00:40:41.133
we take pride in ourselves.

277
00:40:41.133 --> 00:40:43.400
- Good Lord.

278
00:40:44.867 --> 00:40:46.400
Mum!

279
00:40:47.333 --> 00:40:50.033
One. two. three...

280
00:40:56.233 --> 00:40:58.467
Oh. ow!

281
00:40:58.467 --> 00:41:00.667
It shouldn't sting
for too long.

282
00:41:43.967 --> 00:41:48.467
Pssss!

283
00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:50.533
Hey. you like that jam?

284
00:42:50.533 --> 00:42:52.233
That's my jam.

285
00:42:52.233 --> 00:42:53.633
George's jam.

286
00:43:01.233 --> 00:43:02.900
Good boy. Bear.

287
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.233
Good boy. Bear.

288
00:43:08.633 --> 00:43:10.333
Good boy. Bear.

289
00:44:03.067 --> 00:44:05.533
Got a few bags. George?

290
00:44:06.567 --> 00:44:09.633
- Good start?
-  Yeah. good workers.

291
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.967
How's
the new boy doing?

292
00:44:12.967 --> 00:44:15.200
Yeah.
he's doing alright.

293
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.633
Good.

294
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.367
Needs a name. though.

295
00:44:21.033 --> 00:44:23.300
You going to wet his head. too?

296
00:44:24.233 --> 00:44:26.200
We'll just call him
New Boy for now.

297
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.000
You're the boss.

298
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.433
Alright.
it's lunch. boys.

299
00:44:32.833 --> 00:44:34.600
Alright.

300
00:44:37.333 --> 00:44:39.333
Right. who'd like a sandwich?

301
00:44:40.267 --> 00:44:43.433
Michael. would you
hand out the sandwiches?

302
00:44:43.433 --> 00:44:44.767
Alright.

303
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.233
Yes. Come on. Bear.

304
00:44:54.667 --> 00:44:56.533
"To Dom Peter.

305
00:44:56.533 --> 00:44:58.367
That's it.

306
00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.600
"He has been sent."

307
00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.433
Okay. men.
let's get to that rock wall.

308
00:45:14.633 --> 00:45:16.433
Come this way.
This way here.

309
00:45:26.467 --> 00:45:28.067
Hey.

310
00:45:29.133 --> 00:45:31.467
Go find the boys.

311
00:45:31.467 --> 00:45:33.367
You've got to pull your weight.

312
00:45:46.633 --> 00:45:49.633
"He has been sent.

313
00:45:49.633 --> 00:45:52.867
"We pray that this ghastly war
will soon end.

314
00:45:52.867 --> 00:45:56.400
"but until that day
he must remain in your care.

315
00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.133
"We trust. Dom Peter.
that you will guard him wisely.

316
00:46:00.133 --> 00:46:03.600
"as you guard the lost souls
under your charge."

317
00:46:27.933 --> 00:46:30.000
That's it.

318
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.100
Come on. keep 'em coming.

319
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.833
Rocks there.

320
00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:44.967
George. Michael fainted!

321
00:46:44.967 --> 00:46:46.433
Snake!

322
00:46:46.433 --> 00:46:49.633
- Hey? Where? Move. move!
- There!

323
00:46:52.633 --> 00:46:53.833
Kill it.

324
00:46:53.833 --> 00:46:55.667
Go get help. Go. go. go!

325
00:47:07.933 --> 00:47:09.133
Shit!

326
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.800
Come on. boy.
Come on. boy. Come on!

327
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.367
Come on. boy.

328
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.667
Before
the snake told Eve

329
00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:58.267
to eat the forbidden fruit.

330
00:48:58.267 --> 00:49:00.633
they were oblivious to evil.

331
00:49:00.633 --> 00:49:02.967
They thought not bad thoughts

332
00:49:02.967 --> 00:49:05.367
and did not bad things.

333
00:49:05.367 --> 00:49:08.367
And they were naked
in their innocence.

334
00:49:11.567 --> 00:49:12.867
Whoa.

335
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.300
Come on.

336
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.233
Well. quit your gawking.

337
00:49:48.233 --> 00:49:50.667
Sister Eileen will put
the radio on for yas.

338
00:49:50.667 --> 00:49:53.600
Hmm. good idea. Sister.
Come on. boys.

339
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.700
That's Mary.

340
00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.367

There's a lot of work
to do today.

355

Perhaps tomorrow he'll join us.

356

Come on. wake up!

357
00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.667
Much to do. Much to do.

358
00:53:47.067 --> 00:53:50.500
Yeah. hold him up.
Keep him tight. Hold it!

359
00:54:49.867 --> 00:54:52.367
Over here! Over here!
Over here! He's over here!

There's a big...
There's a big one in here!

361

I've got it! I've got it!

362
00:54:57.733 --> 00:54:59.300
Come here!
You're not even looking!

363
00:55:01.833 --> 00:55:04.567
- Oh. wait. it ran away!
- He's just over there!

364
00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:06.933
He's over there! He's over

00:55:16.133 --> 00:55:17.500
Hmm.

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.600
Look. Sister!

367
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.733

Oh! I see you have
our precious cargo.

373
00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.100
Yeah. I do. Sister.

374
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.867
I just need a Dom Peter

375
00:57:13.867 --> 00:57:15.533
to be able to
sign for it. please.

376
00:57:15.533 --> 00:57:17.767
He's not here. he's...

377
00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.567
Um...

378
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.300
Yeah. I'll sign.

379
00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:25.367
Ah. I'm afraid
it has to be Dom Peter

380
00:57:25.367 --> 00:57:27.167
that takes delivery
of the goods.

381
00:57:27.167 --> 00:57:30.133
Of course. of course.

382
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.033
You know. when I said
Dom Peter wasn't here.

383
00:57:35.033 --> 00:57:37.267
I meant he's not 'all here'.

384
00:57:37.267 --> 00:57:38.900
Oh!

385
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.133
Well...

386
00:57:48.167 --> 00:57:50.467
Wait. um...

387
00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:53.900

Yeah. yeah. he...

396
00:58:44.233 --> 00:58:46.067
No. electric start.

-  Who knows?

401
00:58:53.267 --> 00:58:55.267
Why did you wake me up?

402
00:58:55.267 --> 00:58:56.900

01:00:08.033 --> 01:00:11.733
Sister. you sounded
just like Dom Peter.

430
01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:14.167
Oh. children.
you just heard some words

431
01:00:14.167 --> 01:00:16.100
that you haven't heard
for quite some time.

432
01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.567
And I pray you'll never have
to hear them again.

433
01:00:18.567 --> 01:00:20.500
What is it. Sister?

434
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.833
It's a great
responsibility. Michael.

435
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.267
- Quickly. come on.
-  Alright.

436
01:00:25.267 --> 01:00:26.933

440
01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:35.667
Right.

441
01:00:35.667 --> 01:00:37.767
Slide him off.
Put him down there.

442
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.533
Put him up. Good men. Good.

443
01:00:48.733 --> 01:00:50.100
Yeah.

444
01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:58.200
Oh. blessed Father.

445
01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:05.333
He's travelled a long way.

446
01:01:12.333 --> 01:01:15.967
He had to be
hidden from some nasty people.

447
01:01:15.967 --> 01:01:18.467
doing some nasty things.

448
01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:20.167
The Nazis?

449
01:01:20.167 --> 01:01:22.200
He's all that's good.

450
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.267
and all that's holy.

451
01:01:24.267 --> 01:01:27.000
And all that
they seek to destroy.

452
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.267
Who. the nasties?

453
01:01:30.233 --> 01:01:33.200
Yes. Henry. the nasties.

454
01:01:39.967 --> 01:01:42.100
Now it's said

455
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.433
that he can perform miracles.

456
01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.400

I believe that your son
Jesus Christ

544
01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:55.667
took the punishment
I deserve

545
01:31:55.667 --> 01:31:57.767
and died on the cross
and I thank you.

546

raised him from the dead.

547
01:32:00.133 --> 01:32:03.367
And I receive Jesus Christ
as my Lord and saviour.

548
01:32:03.367 --> 01:32:05.800
I believe that your son
Jesus Christ

549
01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.533
took the punishment
I deserve

550
01:32:07.533 --> 01:32:09.400
and died on the cross
and I thank you.

551
01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.267
You raised him
from the dead.

552
01:32:11.267 --> 01:32:14.000
And I receive Jesus Christ
as my Lord and saviour.

553
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.700
God! Dear God. I accept
I have sinned and done wrong.

554
01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.067
And I receive Jesus Christ
as my Lord and saviour.

555
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.467
Dear God...

556
01:37:45.033 --> 01:37:46.267
Oh!

01:37:50.567 --> 01:37:52.267
Where is he?

558
01:37:52.267 --> 01:37:54.133
What have you done?

559
01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:00.700

Why would you do this to us?

564
01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:39.767

Stupid. stupid girl.

572
01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:36.900
He will not abandon you.

573
01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:39.500
for he is your Father.

574
01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.800
And as your Father.
he will protect you.

575
01:42:43.967 --> 01:42:46.300
For you are his sons.

576
01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:49.733
- He gave you life.

577
01:42:49.733 --> 01:42:52.467
So that you shall give
your life to him.

578
01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:21.400
May your divine assistance
always be with us.

579
01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.200
And may the souls
of the faithfully departed...

580
01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.633
Sister!

After his resurrection.

593
01:44:35.033 --> 01:44:37.500
Jesus told his disciples.

594
01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:39.933
"Go forth.

595
01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:44.933
