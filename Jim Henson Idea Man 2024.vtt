00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.888
You know. I'm an idea man.

5
00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.933
I spend a lot of time thinking.

6
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.146
Thoughts are funny things.

7
00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.441
They can lead to ideas.

8
00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:28.319
There's one now.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.031
["II B.S." playing]

10
00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.503
Now. when you get an idea.

11
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.299
you have to look at it
from every direction.

12
00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:52.594

14
00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.269
{\an8}Help.

17
00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.407
{\an8}Then along comes a new. fresh idea.

18
00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.617
[shouts]

19
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.871
And this gives you other ideas.

20
00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.291
which gives birth to other ideas.

21
00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:29.130
And finally the whole thing crystallizes
into one gloriously marvelous.

22
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.508
great. big. beautiful idea.

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:45.814

26
00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:07.085
{\an8}[Seeff] Stand up. There's. uh--
There's a little rectangle on the floor.

27
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.295
Stand up.

28
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.799
I think he looks so good this way
that I'm--

29
00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.634
It's just it's so graphic an image.

30
00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.470
Great.

31
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.472
- Yeah.
- I don't do this for a living.

32
00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.182
- [Rockwell] You got a great face.
- [Seeff] Oh.

33
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:22.809
[Rockwell] Oh. yeah.

34
00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:28.398
[Seeff] How would you define yourself now.
as a puppeteer or a filmmaker or...

35
00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:32.277
- [stammers] Any of those.
- [Seeff] Yeah. right.

36
00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.362
- And all of the above?
- Yeah. Sure.

37
00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:40.201
Do you get a lot of fear wondering
whether your perceptions are correct?

38
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.538
[Jim] Uh. when you're running a whole.
you know. several-hundred-person unit.

39
00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:47.083
uh. you have to keep
everybody else enthusiastic.

40
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.502
- [Seeff] Uh-huh.
- You can't really express

41
00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.629
grave doubts and stuff.
whether or not your--

42
00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.965
this whole thing is a good idea or not.

43
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.050
[Seeff] Yeah.

44
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.553
- [shutter clicks]
- Is this a nine-to-five job?

45
00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:01.765
No. it's sort of... [chuckles]
...an all-the-time job.

46
00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.099
- [laughs]
- [Seeff] Yeah.

47
00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.644
It's every-- "every moment of one's life"
kind of a job. I suppose.

48
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.608
[Oz] I met Jim when I was 17.

49
00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.778
And it took about ten years
to get to the point

50
00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.030
where we could sense each other's rhythms.

51
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.365
[shutter clicks]

52
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:22.118
I was the mainstay performer
with Jim for 35 years.

53
00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.044
{\an8}Jim created out of innocence.

54
00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.673
He was a very rare. rare creature.

55
00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:39.010
He was so internal and quiet

56
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.472
that his inner life
must have been sparkling.

57
00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.477
He had so many ideas
and so many things he wanted to do.

58
00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:52.482
And so the idea of time. I think.
was very much on Jim's mind always.

59
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.652
[clock ticking]

60
00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.529
[Rockwell] I was what they called
a "creative assistant."

61
00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:01.449
{\an8}an assistant that would travel with Jim
and shadow him 24-7.

62
00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.077
You should be much more active.
You need to be running around.

63
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.079
[ticking continues]

64
00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:10.291
His ideas came from excitement in him.

65
00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:14.963
[Rockwell] He said to me
that from a very early age.

66
00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:19.509
he had the feeling that he was here
for a purpose and a reason.

67
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.303
And that was largely what drove him.

68
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.892
{\an8}I feel like he came onto this planet. and
he knew he had a mission and a calling.

69
00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.353
He's like.
"Gotta get it done. Gotta get it done."

70
00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:36.234
[Rockwell] His schedule was so packed.
New York to London to Toronto to LA.

71
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:38.945
His drive was superhuman.

72
00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.364
Uh. we have to keep going.
and you get to go home.

73
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.158
[Goelz] It was a restlessness.

74
00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:46.786
{\an8}He was always doing. always creating.
And he was urgent about it.

75
00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.621
Wrap it up and get to the ending.

76
00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:52.459
[Jim] I've always operated
doing a few things at the same time.

77
00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.336
And I find it very exciting.

78
00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:59.174
{\an8}It's just an incredibly busy life
with a shocking amount of things

79
00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.967
{\an8}that got done in every year.

80
00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.804
[Oz] Why he kept going so much.
I don't know.

81
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.516
There's no real one answer.
That's the trouble. you know?

82
00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:11.644
[creaking]

83
00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:24.491
Muppets. they're superstars.

84
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.745
250 million people enjoy them every week.

85
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.830
And just because they're so popular.

86
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.334
we may neglect to notice
that Muppetry is also an art.

87
00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:38.505
Sitting beside me here is
the Muppet master himself.

88
00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.215
There's only one word for Jim.

89
00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:41.549
He's a genius.

90
00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:45.553
Think of Rasputin as an Eagle Scout.

91
00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:46.888
[audience laughs]

92
00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:49.808
And in the chair next to him.
and. indeed. seldom far from him.

93
00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:54.312
is Jim's close associate and friend.
a man who truly fits his name.

94
00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:58.358
Ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Frank Oz and Mr. Jim Henson.

95
00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.442
[applause]

96
00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.405
Let's get this on the record.
How did you start?

97
00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.408
So when I started. it was. like.
just out of high school.

98
00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.660
and I just heard
about a television station

99
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.245
that was looking for a puppeteer.

100
00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.330
And so I made puppets and auditioned

101
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.082
because I really wanted
to work in television.

102
00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:18.294
I don't recall ever seeing
a puppet show when I was a kid.

103
00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.338
You never saw a puppet?

104
00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.676
No. And I never played with puppets.
I never had any to play with.

105
00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.724
[Lisa] He grew up in rural Mississippi.
Leland. Mississippi.

106
00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:35.729
on a Department of Agriculture
research station.

107
00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.315
His mother was a Christian Scientist.

108
00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:44.279
{\an8}and his father agreed to be
Christian Science because he loved her.

109
00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.115
His older brother was his best friend.

110
00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.201
{\an8}They would spend a lot of time outside.

111
00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.287
a lot of time exploring.

112
00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.291
If you imagine the peacefulness...

113
00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:04.174
{\an8}he really had that kind of childhood
where your mind is allowed to fill in.

114
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.848
[Jim] When I was fairly young.
we just got a television set.

115
00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.851
Television was in its early days.

116
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.645
and I thought it was
such an exciting thing.

117
00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:19.939
This television picture
that was happening in one place.

118
00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.900
and you could see
what was going on somewhere else.

119
00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:28.531
{\an8}From the first time he saw a television.
I think that's where he wanted to go.

120
00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:33.036
[Cheryl] You think of a guy
growing up in Mississippi.

121
00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:37.499
A television set
could bring the world into your home.

122
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.834
Like. that's just like. boom.
mind-blowing.

123
00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:42.671
- [static]
- <i>His name is Jim Henson.</i>

124
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:45.507
<i>the most famous name
in the whole history of puppetry.</i>

125
00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:48.218
And you're telling us
that you went into puppetry

126
00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.053
just as a way to get into television?

127
00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:52.931
Yes. because I wanted to work
in this field. I-I loved it.

128
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:54.307
- [scoffs]
- [audience laughs]

129
00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:03.942
[Jim] Throughout.
I'd get all the credit and so forth.

130
00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:09.406
But back in the early days.
it was my wife. Jane.

131
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.492
Actually. she wasn't my wife
when we started working.

132
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:16.871
She and I were the whole thing
for the first. oh. five. seven years.

133
00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:21.626
My mom had a wicked sense of humor.
She was really. really funny.

134
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:27.173
She was very. very artsy.
but she was also extremely earthy.

135
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.305
{\an8}She was a painter and a ceramicist.
and her art was very important to her.

136
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.810
{\an8}I met Jim in a puppetry class.

137
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.147
{\an8}It was my senior year.
and he was a freshman.

138
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:46.651
When he was young. everything was
absolutely intriguing to him.

139
00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:49.237
and he just couldn't wait
to get on to the next thing.

140
00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:54.159
The puppetry class really was the first
thing he did with the university.

141
00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.619
It was a senior class.

142
00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.538
and Jim was coming in as a freshman.

143
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.167
He started writing all the scripts.
designing the puppets.

144
00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.127
and he pretty much took over the class.

145
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.589
And he had
that boy-genius quality about him.

146
00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:09.966
His skin wasn't perfect.

147
00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:11.885
He wanted to take care of his acne.

148
00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.138
and his mother didn't want
to have him go to a doctor.

149
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.807
So as soon as he could grow a beard.
he just wanted to have one.

150
00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:23.521
[Lisa] He thought of himself
as a pimply-faced. skinny teenager.

151
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.358
and then carried that with him
for a long time.

152
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.988
When they first met.
she was much worldlier on multiple levels.

153
00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:35.492
She came from New York.
She had had other boyfriends.

154
00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.994
She was more socially adept than him.

155
00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:44.626
{\an8}They both had a sophisticated appreciation
of nonsense and absurdity.

156
00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:47.212
That's probably what pulled them together.

157
00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:52.300
[Jane] He already had some puppets on TV
'cause he started in high school.

158
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:58.682
And it was in that spring semester
that Jim asked me to help him at WRC.

159
00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.522
{\an8}Jim was an artist.

160
00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:08.650
He wanted production design.
but he was fascinated by television.

161
00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:10.527
[crew] Action.

162
00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.446
I heard of a TV station
that was looking for a puppeteer.

163
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.907
So I painted the scenery
and I built the puppets.

164
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:19.411
and wrote the materials
and auditioned and got a job.

165
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.538
{\an8}And that's kind of how it all started.

166
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.207
{\an8}I did this thing
that was called <i>Sam and Friends</i>.

167
00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.668
It was late at night. It was on at 11:30.

168
00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.587
which was a strange kind of time
for a puppet show.

169
00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:31.506
- [audience laughing]
- But. uh--

170
00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.049
But. at the time.

171
00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:36.302
we never thought of ourselves
as being particularly for children.

172
00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:40.432
{\an8}Going now to two of the best people
in the world. I think.

173
00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:43.518
They're Jim and Jane Henson.
And they have two friends.

174
00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:44.436
They call 'em Muppets

175
00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.896
because they're neither puppets
or marionettes. but kind of a combination.

176
00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:47.897
They invented them.

177
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:50.066
Here we go to Washington
and Jim and Jane Henson.

178
00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:58.616
<i>♪ Yes!
We have no bananas ♪</i>

179
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.495
<i>♪ We have no bananas today ♪</i>

180
00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.416
[Jane] It almost always started
with some kind of a musical piece.

181
00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.251
and do his visual interpretations.

182
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:11.755
Jim would pick a record.
and he would build puppets to go with it.

183
00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:13.173
And I would help perform.

184
00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.382
<i>♪ ...old-fashioned tomato ♪</i>

185
00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:18.303
[Juhl] Sometimes it was a sort of
sophomoric. uh. record pantomimes.

186
00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:21.097
Other times.
it was completely zany sketch comedies.

187
00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:22.349
The truth is out!

188
00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.184
[Juhl]
And it attracted this huge following

189
00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.644
in Washington D.C.. of all places.

190
00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.938
where everybody watched the news.

191
00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:34.444
[Jane] Everything was live.
Nothing was taped.

192
00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.197
Whatever you did.
went out over the air as you did it.

193
00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:41.534
And our style of puppetry.
we didn't even try to be sophisticated.

194
00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:45.955
Television was very new.
and really. Jim went to play.

195
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.040
[record scratches]

196
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:51.044
[Oz] There's so many things that
Jim did at that time to explore puppetry.

197
00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.546
<i>♪ Old black magic has me in its spell ♪</i>

198
00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:57.926
<i>♪ Old black magic that you weave so well ♪</i>

199
00:11:57.926 --> 00:12:01.179
What Jim did is
he took the first proscenium away.

200
00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:03.431
and made the TV set the stage.

201
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.767
<i>♪ Like a leaf caught in a tide ♪</i>

202
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:10.438
<i>♪ I should stay away
But what can I do? ♪</i>

203
00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:13.900
Not only that.
but he worked with the close-up.

204
00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:18.071
Most shows at that time
didn't have close-ups of puppets.

205
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:25.120
<i>♪ The old black magic called love ♪</i>

206
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:28.498

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:31.793

209
00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:37.132
Jim and Jane. I'm--
I'm glad that you run the lady's part.

210
00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.591
- Oh.

211
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.343
- [Jane] This is Kermit.
- It's Kermit.

212
00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:43.763
And this is Sam. Some of our characters
change sex very easily...

213
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.932
- [Jane chuckles]
- ...with the addition of a wig.

214
00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.351
[presenter] Kermit--
Uh. yeah. I see. Okay.

215
00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:57.610
{\an8}[Brian] To start with. my dad just had
sort of a-- a troupe of puppets that--

216
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.778
that he had designed.

217
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:01.031
And they were very different
from each other.

218
00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.533
And Kermit was just one of them.

219
00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:04.617

for-- for puppets for him.

223
00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:21.593
In the very early experimentation.
Kermit was right there.

224
00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:25.972
Kermit wasn't a frog then.

225
00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.474

227
00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.936
[Lisa] Initially.
it was just one of the troupe.

228
00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:35.523
My mother puppeteered it sometimes.
[chuckles]

229
00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.442
Kermit wore a wig at times.

- [host] <i>That's how you began?</i>

237
00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:05.470
[Jim] It was my mother's coat
and a Ping-Pong ball. you know.

238
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.555
which I cut in half to make the eyes.

239
00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:16.398
[Lisa] He was sort of sitting vigil

240
00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.608
{\an8}with his grandfather.
who was very. very ill.

241
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.948
The story is he used Kermit to entertain
his grandfather as he was dying.

242
00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:31.579
My mom thought there was a little bit
of a spiritual connection to the puppet.

243
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:35.625
It was a way of bringing lightness
and bringing humor.

244
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.673
My dad always felt like humor was
an antidote. that it was a saving grace.

245
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.468
[Brian] Kermit was one
of the more generic of the puppets.

246
00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:47.637
but it fit his hand really well.

247
00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.931
He could puppeteer really well through it.

248
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.349
[no audible dialogue]

249
00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:54.310
He was learning that
a really simple puppet. like Kermit.

250
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.606
could be very expressive just by
using the fabric and letting it distort.

251
00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:01.568
but controlling the distortion
so that they become expressions.

252
00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:04.529
- Give me a dozen eggs.
- How about a loaf of Claussen's bread?

253
00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:05.739
Nah. just give me the eggs.

254
00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:06.906
Give him the eggs!

255
00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.117
He'll learn to buy Claussen's.

256
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:15.415
The fact that the puppet is so simple.
and it really almost exposes the hand.

257
00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.667
makes it very close to him.

258
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:24.341
And. over time. he really imbued
that character with more of himself.

259
00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.844
[Jim] Kermit is--
is more outgoing than I am. certainly.

260
00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:31.264
I am more laid back.
I-- I don't do outrageous.

261
00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.808
I-- I do his outrageous things.
That's true.

[eggshell cracks]

265
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.568
I guess it's close
to an alter ego of some sort.

266
00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:45.653
How's that for happily ever after?

267
00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:46.738

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.326
Oh. Harry. we're blocking
some people's view.

270
00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:53.703
Oh. excuse me. I sure don't want
to keep anybody from seeing

271
00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.955
this gorgeous Esskay bacon package.

272
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.957
It's a very tasty package.

273
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.377
[Jane] Jim was doing
<i>Sam and Friends</i> daily shows.

274
00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:03.755
Even though it was fun.
he was very confined.

275
00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:10.095
[Cheryl] He was particularly sensitive
to being boxed in.

276
00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.681
[Lisa] He wanted to be an artist.

277
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:14.182
He was interested in filmmaking.

278
00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:17.435
He was interested in television.
not strictly puppetry.

279
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.731
He was figuring out
what he wanted to do next in his life.

280
00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.443
[Jim] I was going through
those sort of early times in one's life.

281
00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.028
I was breaking up with a girl.

282
00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:29.864
[Jane] We were kind of dating other people
and everything.

283
00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:32.283
We had life going on
during <i>Sam and Friends</i>.

284
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.414
[Brian] Well. he clearly had
a moment of self-doubt.

285
00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:41.209
Here's a track.
I could stay on this track.

286
00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:42.961
but is this the track I want?

287
00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:46.464
[Jim] So I decided to go away and paint.

288
00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:48.383
Then I went to Europe.

289
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:00.353
{\an8}[horn honks]

290

[shutter clicks]

291
00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.320
[Jim] I wandered around.

292
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.655
[chattering]

293
00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.866
Then I met a lot of other puppeteers.

294
00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:18.955
[Cheryl] He could see that puppetry
was taken more seriously in Europe.

295
00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:23.543
I mean. they got funded.
They had companies. They had theaters.

296
00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:30.425
[Oz] He started to believe
that puppetry was an art form.

297
00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:33.595
and could express things
that humans couldn't express.

298
00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:36.264
[Jim] In the course of that little trip.

299
00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.850
I found that people were doing
interesting things.

300
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.979
and it was something that.
uh. you could get into and develop

301
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.440
and-- and turn into something else.

302
00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:47.525
That's what you did. all right.

303
00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:55.909
[Jim] I came back from that trip
all fired up.

304
00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:59.662
[Jane] He really had it in his mind.
"This is what we're gonna do."

305
00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:02.499
We're gonna do this with the puppets.
and then we're gonna get married.

306
00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:07.212
Falling in love is
a kind of a funny way of putting it

307
00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:09.381
because. I don't know.
we were just with each other.

308
00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:11.508
and we were very fond
of being with each other.

309
00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:17.430
He and my mom founded
a company called Muppets. Inc.

310
00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:24.229
[Jane] But as soon as it was incorporated.
that's when we settled on the 60-40.

311
00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:26.398
which it kind of always was from then on.

312
00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:31.069
It was around October or so
that we decided to get married.

313
00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:32.987
[applause]

314
00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:36.157
But I don't know at that time
we knew what the future would be.

315
00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:45.083
{\an8}[Lisa] My mom sometimes said
that they got married too young.

316
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:51.131
She was aware that he was maybe too young
to settle down for the rest of his life.

317
00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:52.382
having gotten married at 23.

318
00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.592
Now. that was probably
not too young for her though.

319
00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.595
[Jane] Right about that time.
we got that local Emmy.

320
00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:03.685
I do remember Jim getting it
from Richard Nixon.

321
00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:05.729
and you have to stand there
having your picture taken.

322
00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:07.313
You have to say something. right?

323
00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:11.067
But I do remember Jim came up
and he said. "Nixon said to me.

324
00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.820
'I knew a man in the navy
with a beard.'" [chuckles]

325
00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:19.075
[Brian] At that time. he was
holding it all together with my mother.

326
00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:21.536
[chuckling] Just the two of them
figuring it all out.

327
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.582
[Jane] Then we had a baby in May of '60.

328
00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:31.463
And then in August '61. we went
to Puppeteers of America Festival.

329
00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:37.427
Jim was anxious to know other puppeteers.

330
00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.512
and also to look for somebody
to work with him.

331
00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.600
He really was in search
of putting together a team.

332
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.685
[audience laughing]

333
00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.897
Jim started asking around for someone.

334
00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:50.273
And everybody was saying.

335
00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:53.151
"You really should see
a very young man named Frank Oznowicz."

336
00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:57.781
{\an8}[Oz] I was 17. I hadn't finished
high school when Jim saw me.

337
00:19:57.781 --> 00:20:01.034
{\an8}I had worked for four or five years doing
puppet shows all around the Bay area.

338
00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.453
I think Jim could sense
that feeling and timing

339
00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:06.539
I learned through all those years
of doing all those shows.

340
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.417
And I could hold an audience.
I think that was the key thing.

341
00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:13.713
[Lisa] Frank Oz was. initially.

342
00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:18.134
a very mischievous son
of a very serious puppeteer.

343
00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:22.097
{\an8}[Oz] My dad and mom escaped
from Antwerp. Belgium

344
00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.848
{\an8}at the beginning of the war.

345
00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:27.102
{\an8}My father was a window dresser
and a sign painter.

346
00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:31.272
And. to the degree that I know.
he carved puppets out of wood.

347
00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:35.443
Then when he met my mom.
she made the characters' clothes.

348
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.407
{\an8}They really took the art of puppetry
so seriously

349
00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:43.493
{\an8}that Frank could never take
the art of puppetry seriously.

350
00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:48.665
Frank and I met Jim

351
00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:50.166
{\an8}at exactly the same time.

352
00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.168
{\an8}In fact. Frank and I
were doing a show together.

353
00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:55.380
[Oz] Jerry was asked by Jim to join him.

354
00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:59.592
I probably never would have had the job
except that Frank was too young...

355
00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.845
[chuckles] ...to-- to leave home.

356
00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:04.514
{\an8}[Jane] Jerry Juhl came in '61.

357
00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:07.017
{\an8}I was pregnant with Cheryl. and Jim felt

358
00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:09.477
{\an8}that I was no longer dependable.
[chuckles]

359
00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.897
{\an8}[Juhl] Shortly thereafter.
Don Sahlin joined the team

360
00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:16.234
and became
the genius builder of the Muppets.

361
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.447
He was this quiet.
very funny. obsessed man.

362
00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:25.952
{\an8}[Oz] I completed high school.
and that's when he asked me to come on.

363
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.039
{\an8}[Juhl] That was the core group
for quite a while.

364
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:37.172
I arrived at 53rd and Second Avenue.
and there were two rooms.

365
00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:40.759
One room was a little cubicle
for a secretary.

366
00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:43.094
and then there was a workshop
for Don Sahlin.

367
00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:45.555
And he had the gerbils running around.

368
00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:49.809
[Juhl] Don took a basketball one day
and cut it in half.

369
00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:53.813
And that became the basis of Rowlf's head.

370
00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:58.401
[Jane] And. of course.
Rowlf became the big star.

371
00:21:58.401 --> 00:21:59.778
- Howdy.
- Was that him?

372
00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:00.904
- Yep.
- Howdy.

373
00:22:00.904 --> 00:22:02.405
- Is that all he says?
- He's a star.

374
00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:04.449
- Any more and we have to pay him.
- Howdy.

375
00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:09.871
{\an8}[Jane] Immediately. Jim and Frank
started performing together.

376
00:22:10.497 --> 00:22:15.001
{\an8}And almost the first thing that Frank did
was to play the extra hand of Rowlf.

377
00:22:15.627 --> 00:22:18.546
He then had a weekly spot
on Jimmy Dean's show.

378
00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:20.298
{\an8}- You're on the other side.
- I'm on the other side.

379
00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:21.716
{\an8}- Now. Rowlf--
- I got water in my ear.

{\an8}[audience laughs]

381
00:22:24.386 --> 00:22:26.471
{\an8}- Okay. Now I'm running again.
- All right. Now you're running.

382
00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:28.056
{\an8}- Now you're going faster and faster.
- Faster.

00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:29.641
- Lickety-split.
- I'm lickety-split.

384

- What's the matter?

385
00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:34.354
- I think I just split my lickety.
- [audience laughs. applauds]

386
00:22:34.354 --> 00:22:37.691
[Oz] My part was basically an apprentice.

387
00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:40.026
I didn't do anything. you know.
except the right hand.

388
00:22:40.026 --> 00:22:42.487
- All right. Jimbone.
- [laughs]

389
00:22:42.487 --> 00:22:48.243
[Jane] Frank always had such a emotionally
loaded relationship with puppets.

390
00:22:49.327 --> 00:22:53.039
Jim could relate to that a lot. too.
'cause he didn't intend to be a puppeteer.

391
00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:55.500
And here was Frank.
who didn't intend to be a puppeteer.

392
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.253
but Jim very quickly picked up on that.

393
00:22:58.253 --> 00:23:01.923
Frank also wanted to do things
really. really good.

394
00:23:01.923 --> 00:23:03.925
And that was really their bond.

we're doing a television show backstage.

We're watching a television set here

We'll play back a little bit of the show
so that you can see

406

you can perform and see your performance

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:15.038
exactly as the audience does.

416
00:24:15.038 --> 00:24:18.041
And so. as we're performing.
we're also editing.

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:19.417
We're framing the shots.

418
00:24:21.002 --> 00:24:23.088
It's a magical transformation.

{\an8}Positive.

423
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:37.811
{\an8}[Oz] During that time.
we were making a lot of commercials.

00:24:37.811 --> 00:24:42.774
But the amazing thing with Jim was.
even though he had to do something

that he didn't really want to do.

426

to sell a product and tell a joke.

[Jim] In the old days.
a lot of our stuff was very violent.

435
00:25:12.387 --> 00:25:16.766
It was before we even started
talking about violence on television.

but I didn't hear it.

447
00:25:39.122 --> 00:25:41.458
[Juhl] Doing commercials
was a practical matter for Jim.

448
00:25:43.209 --> 00:25:46.671
It allowed him to build
a-a small team of people

449
00:25:46.671 --> 00:25:49.466
that would be able to move on
and do bigger things.

Jim created a big dollar bill like this
that hung on the wall.

and it was all made with coins and money.
and that was the altar to money.

495
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.836
[Jim] It's a film that's made of a lot
of little short segments chopped together.

496
00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:34.756

that I was enjoying doing at the time.

[Brian] The idea was mixing seemingly
unrelated images in quick sequence

503

506
00:28:58.697 --> 00:29:00.532
[Oz] We did that on weekends.

507
00:29:00.532 --> 00:29:02.158
We'd make commercials.

508
00:29:02.158 --> 00:29:04.244
and then we'd have enough money
to shoot on the weekend.

509
00:29:04.244 --> 00:29:07.539
And that's how we shot <i>Time Piece</i>
for a year with an old Rackover 35.

For my dad. time was ticking all the time.

Because he wanted to do more
than is humanly possible.

515
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.478
there was never gonna be enough time.

516
00:29:30.478 --> 00:29:31.646

[flushes]

518
00:29:37.027 --> 00:29:39.696
[Brian] That idea that time could run out.

519
00:29:39.696 --> 00:29:42.615
I'm sure came
with the death of his brother.

520
00:29:50.707 --> 00:29:54.377
{\an8}It was huge. It was huge.
Losing his brother was huge to him.

521
00:29:55.754 --> 00:30:00.467
{\an8}[Brian] They were inseparable.
Like. they were brothers and best friends.

522
00:30:01.009 --> 00:30:04.512
{\an8}And my father was. uh.
two or three years younger than him.

523
00:30:07.515 --> 00:30:10.518
{\an8}He died in a car accident
at the army base.

524
00:30:11.686 --> 00:30:12.771
{\an8}He was very young.

525
00:30:16.566 --> 00:30:19.569
It was a huge shock to the family.

526
00:30:21.488 --> 00:30:23.490
Absolutely shattered my dad's world.

527
00:30:29.079 --> 00:30:32.582
[Cheryl] The whole family
had a really difficult time.

528
00:30:33.208 --> 00:30:35.251
He saw his mom get really depressed.

529
00:30:35.251 --> 00:30:37.671
He saw his mom. like. start to give up.

530
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.799
And he wasn't gonna do that.

531
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:42.217
He was gonna keep going.

532
00:30:48.431 --> 00:30:51.434
["I'm a Man" playing]

533
00:30:59.859 --> 00:31:03.071
[Oz] In the 1960s.
Jim was excited to create work

534
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:05.407
that reflected everything
that was going on in the country.

535
00:31:08.993 --> 00:31:11.871
I think part of it is shocking. and
I think part of it is very interesting.

536
00:31:13.206 --> 00:31:15.500
He did this show called <i>Youth 68</i>.

537
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.920
{\an8}I think it's finally getting down to
the nitty-gritty of artistic expression.

538
00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.631
{\an8}[Cheryl] It was very much
about the generational divide.

539
00:31:21.631 --> 00:31:25.010
It was about the music. It was about
the politics. It was about the protests.

540
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.096
It was about
what is happening in the world.

541
00:31:28.096 --> 00:31:30.223
- Well. I think it's garbage.
- I love it.

542
00:31:30.223 --> 00:31:32.392
- I don't understand it.
- I think it's wonderful.

543
00:31:32.392 --> 00:31:34.561
Yeah. sure.
It's always more exciting. Then what?

544
00:31:34.561 --> 00:31:37.355
[music continues]

545
00:31:37.355 --> 00:31:39.024
[Jim] How can you do a program like this

546
00:31:39.024 --> 00:31:40.734
where you could take
all these people's statements

547
00:31:40.734 --> 00:31:44.362
and you could re-- rearrange it.
you could reedit the film

548
00:31:44.362 --> 00:31:46.865
so that. uh. one person
comes out saying something

549
00:31:46.865 --> 00:31:48.992
they really never intended to say?

550
00:31:48.992 --> 00:31:51.327
This is no way
to make a television program.

551
00:31:52.996 --> 00:31:54.539
Jim was not into drugs or anything.

552
00:31:54.539 --> 00:31:57.667
but he-- he loved
the expression that was going on.

553
00:32:00.211 --> 00:32:05.300
You know. I've learned to walk around
inside my own head.

554
00:32:06.092 --> 00:32:07.427
That may sound silly to you.

555
00:32:07.427 --> 00:32:11.014
but it's been very. very helpful to me.

556
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:16.227
[Oz] Jim wanted to do
more than just the Muppets.

557
00:32:16.227 --> 00:32:17.312
He wanted to experiment.

558
00:32:19.105 --> 00:32:23.026
One of the things he did
during that time was called <i>The Cube.</i>

559
00:32:23.026 --> 00:32:26.529
which was about a man
who was trapped in an alternate reality.

560
00:32:27.322 --> 00:32:29.741
{\an8}What is this place? What's it for?

561
00:32:29.741 --> 00:32:32.243
{\an8}We ask that question
ourselves once in a while.

562
00:32:37.874 --> 00:32:43.129
[Oz] But what Jim was most excited about
was creating a discotheque called Cyclia.

563
00:32:44.005 --> 00:32:46.841
which would have. like.
24 projectors all over the ceiling

564
00:32:46.841 --> 00:32:49.594
with different angles of white.

565
00:32:49.594 --> 00:32:53.932
And then he would project
all this 16 millimeter film

566
00:32:53.932 --> 00:32:55.308
while the music was going on.

567
00:32:56.017 --> 00:32:58.603
[Lisa] He didn't really care
that it was gonna be a nightclub.

568
00:32:58.603 --> 00:33:01.690
It was all about
what is technically possible.

569
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:06.319
He was always excited about the next idea.

570
00:33:07.195 --> 00:33:09.489
[clock ticking]

571
00:33:09.489 --> 00:33:12.325
He wasn't sure that
puppetry would be his thing.

572
00:33:14.035 --> 00:33:19.416
And. in some ways. he was starting
to drift away from the family.

573
00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:27.590
But then he got this invitation.

574
00:33:28.925 --> 00:33:30.385
[no audible dialogue]

575
00:33:30.385 --> 00:33:32.804
[Stone] Children were watching
a tremendous amount of television.

576
00:33:32.804 --> 00:33:34.055
Forty. 50 hours a week.

577
00:33:34.055 --> 00:33:36.349
Some of it bad television.

578
00:33:37.267 --> 00:33:39.227
Joan Cooney had the notion that

579
00:33:39.227 --> 00:33:41.104
if you're going to watch
that much television.

580
00:33:41.104 --> 00:33:44.149
{\an8}why don't we find out what it is
they like to watch on television?

581
00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.445
Then go out and find out
what preschool children ought to know.

582
00:33:48.445 --> 00:33:49.988
and put those two things together.

583
00:33:49.988 --> 00:33:51.156
[chattering]

584
00:33:51.156 --> 00:33:56.036
So Joan found seasoned television
professionals and said.

585
00:33:56.036 --> 00:33:59.122
"Do your thing and we're gonna teach you
how to be educators."

586
00:34:01.583 --> 00:34:05.587
Joan had seen Jim's work and knew
how valuable he would be to the program.

587
00:34:05.587 --> 00:34:08.048
I knew Jim very well.
and I had worked with him.

588
00:34:08.048 --> 00:34:10.467
So I could call him up and say.
"Come on over and talk to us."

589
00:34:11.843 --> 00:34:14.429
[Oz] But Jim wasn't sure
he wanted to do that.

590
00:34:16.056 --> 00:34:18.558
And we weren't into children's shows.
We never did children's stuff.

591
00:34:18.558 --> 00:34:22.437
But there's also a part of him
that sensed the value of the show.

592
00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.777
Because he always sensed
that television could do more.

593
00:34:30.278 --> 00:34:33.990
[Stone] Jim latched on to the idea
that we could create a television show

594
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:37.702
that would really do some good
for a very specific audience

595
00:34:37.702 --> 00:34:39.788
that needed good done for it.

596
00:34:41.164 --> 00:34:44.042
[Jim] I think that television is
such a huge influence on children.

597
00:34:44.042 --> 00:34:47.295
I think it's the next most important
influence to the family.

598
00:34:47.295 --> 00:34:49.005
or the church or the school.

599
00:34:49.005 --> 00:34:50.048
[no audible dialogue]

600
00:34:50.048 --> 00:34:54.052
As an industry. we don't generally
face up to that responsibility.

601
00:34:54.052 --> 00:34:57.931
and I think we need to be
a great deal more responsible

602
00:34:57.931 --> 00:34:59.224
to what we put on the medium.

603
00:35:00.058 --> 00:35:03.853
[Lisa] He had four kids.
all kind of <i>Sesame Street</i> age at home.

604
00:35:04.437 --> 00:35:05.730
and another on the way.

605
00:35:06.481 --> 00:35:08.024
{\an8}My younger brother John

606
00:35:08.024 --> 00:35:12.278
{\an8}had learning difficulties
and was not speaking yet.

607
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:20.203
So the whole idea of "How do kids learn?"
was really personal to him.

608
00:35:23.039 --> 00:35:24.290
[door creaks]

609
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:28.795
But he didn't think that educating
children was anything he was good at.

627
00:36:19.554 --> 00:36:21.723
[Jim] <i>Sesame Street</i> is
one of those interesting things

00:36:21.723 --> 00:36:24.976

00:36:34.319 --> 00:36:37.697
[Brian] I think <i>Sesame Street</i>
was almost the most unlikely thing.

00:36:37.697 --> 00:36:39.657
probably. in terms of his life plan.

634
00:36:41.868 --> 00:36:45.205

00:37:49.686 --> 00:37:52.022
One wedding cake.

654
00:37:52.022 --> 00:37:53.106

[children] <i>♪ And that's our song of one ♪</i>

656
00:38:03.074 --> 00:38:06.661
[Stone] In the summer of '69.
we did some test shows.

657
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:09.539
And the original concept
was the street would be real.

658
00:38:09.539 --> 00:38:11.249
and everything else would be fantasy.

659
00:38:13.209 --> 00:38:15.462
{\an8}The result was the street was deadly dull.

660
00:38:16.629 --> 00:38:20.383
So we realized we had to populate
the street with some interesting puppets.

661
00:38:23.386 --> 00:38:24.512
[pencil scraping]

662
00:38:24.512 --> 00:38:28.600
[Jim] I had in mind that
we would do this large. silly character

663
00:38:30.185 --> 00:38:31.936
who would represent the child.

664
00:38:34.939 --> 00:38:36.441
Oh. good morning.

665
00:38:39.361 --> 00:38:42.280
[Stone] It's possibly
the world's most magnificent puppet.

666
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.198
[yawns]

667
00:38:43.198 --> 00:38:45.033
[snoring]

668
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:49.537
He's also a very highly technical puppet.
which a lot of people don't realize.

669
00:38:50.372 --> 00:38:52.290
And it was Jim's design. top to bottom.

670
00:38:53.625 --> 00:38:56.336
[Jim] Caroll Spinney was one of the few
that had not worked with us before.

671
00:38:56.336 --> 00:39:00.674
I met him at a puppet festival and
I described this very large. yellow bird.

672
00:39:00.674 --> 00:39:02.759
[chattering]

673
00:39:04.719 --> 00:39:07.389
I'm sure he'd had no idea
what he was in for.

674
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:08.932
[crew] Caroll.

675
00:39:10.392 --> 00:39:11.476
There we are.

676
00:39:12.018 --> 00:39:14.437
Ah... [speaks German]

677
00:39:15.522 --> 00:39:19.192
Jim offered it to Frank Oz
but he'd already done the La Choy Dragon.

678
00:39:19.192 --> 00:39:21.319
He says. "You're not getting me
into one of those things again."

679
00:39:21.319 --> 00:39:24.698
And so Jim said. "Whatever
you want to develop. it's all yours."

680
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.826
[Oz] And then he asked Caroll
to do Oscar also.

681
00:39:28.827 --> 00:39:31.287
Ta-da! Hey. that was rotten.

682
00:39:31.871 --> 00:39:35.875
[Heather] I think that having
both Oscar and Big Bird on the street

683
00:39:36.584 --> 00:39:38.420
sort of brought the street to life.

684
00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.005
[crew] Here we go. Rolling sound.

685
00:39:40.005 --> 00:39:42.507
[laughing. chattering]

686
00:39:43.216 --> 00:39:44.384
Yay!

687
00:39:44.968 --> 00:39:47.053
[Stone] The puppets.
from the very beginning.

688
00:39:47.053 --> 00:39:49.931
were an integral part
of our whole concept of the show.

689
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:51.266
[no audible dialogue]

690
00:39:51.266 --> 00:39:53.601
There would be no <i>Sesame Street</i>
without the Muppets.

691
00:39:53.601 --> 00:39:55.395
What's the big one. Big Bird?

692
00:39:55.395 --> 00:39:56.479
Oh. what's the big one?

693
00:39:56.479 --> 00:39:59.858
Oh. that's a picture of me
when I was little.

694
00:40:00.608 --> 00:40:03.486
Wasn't I cute? [chuckles]

695
00:40:03.486 --> 00:40:06.489
Characters have come about
from many different ways.

696
00:40:06.489 --> 00:40:10.410
Some of the characters were puppets
that we had before <i>Sesame Street</i>.

697
00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:13.204
and they took on a personality.

698
00:40:13.204 --> 00:40:15.498
Uh. Cookie Monster certainly was that.

699
00:40:15.498 --> 00:40:17.167
I will count them.

700
00:40:17.167 --> 00:40:18.626
- No. me eat them.
- Count.

701
00:40:18.626 --> 00:40:21.046
- Eat. Eat. eat. eat.
- No. count. Count. count.

702
00:40:21.046 --> 00:40:22.213
- Wait.
- What?

703
00:40:22.213 --> 00:40:25.884
- Why don't we cooperate?
- Ah!

704
00:40:25.884 --> 00:40:28.887
[Oz]
The Count was invented for Jerry Nelson.

705
00:40:29.763 --> 00:40:31.931
Grover was closest to my heart.

706
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:33.183
Oh. they're coming!

707
00:40:33.183 --> 00:40:37.103
- Which way? Which way? Which way?
- That way. [giggles] That way.

708
00:40:37.103 --> 00:40:40.065
[Oz] Guy Smiley was invented
on the show and he was brilliant.

709
00:40:40.065 --> 00:40:42.984
Jim was absolutely brilliant with him.
God. he was so funny.

710
00:40:42.984 --> 00:40:44.736
Wonderful. I'm Guy Smiley.

711
00:40:44.736 --> 00:40:48.907
They call me Guy Smiley because
I changed my name from Bernie Liederkranz.

712
00:40:48.907 --> 00:40:51.493
- [audience cheering]
- Yes. thank you. Yes.

713
00:40:51.493 --> 00:40:55.580
Some of his absolute best performances
took place on <i>Sesame Street</i>

714
00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.333
because he didn't have
to be watching the budget.

715
00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:00.418
He didn't have to be producing.

716
00:41:00.418 --> 00:41:02.712
He was just there to perform.

717
00:41:05.131 --> 00:41:06.800
- [crew] Quiet. please.
- [coughs]

718
00:41:08.093 --> 00:41:10.428
[Jim] Performing the Ernie
and Bert pieces with Frank

719
00:41:10.428 --> 00:41:13.807
has always been one
of the great joys of-- of doing this show.

720
00:41:13.807 --> 00:41:14.891
[director] Action.

721
00:41:15.684 --> 00:41:18.103
- [Bert] Good night. Ern. [groans]
- Good night. Bert.

722
00:41:18.103 --> 00:41:19.813
- Bert?
- [Bert] What?

723
00:41:19.813 --> 00:41:22.065
Oh no. I'm not saying this to you.
I'm sorry. this is to me.

724
00:41:22.065 --> 00:41:24.067
- [Bert] Oh. I didn't hear that.
- Hmm.

725
00:41:24.067 --> 00:41:26.361
This is where I could use that close-up.
Jimmy. If you wanted to.

726
00:41:26.361 --> 00:41:27.987
- [Bert] Oh. you want a close-up now.
- Oh.

727
00:41:27.987 --> 00:41:31.074
I remember in the very beginning.
we-- we first built these characters.

728
00:41:31.074 --> 00:41:33.368
and then we were trying to decide
who should do which.

729
00:41:33.368 --> 00:41:36.955
And I remember trying Bert.
and Frank tried Ernie for a while.

730
00:41:36.955 --> 00:41:40.291
[Oz] We were in front of the mirror
and he was Bert and I was Ernie.

731
00:41:40.291 --> 00:41:41.501
and that wasn't working.

732
00:41:43.461 --> 00:41:45.380
I mean. Jim didn't even have
to make the decision.

733
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.718
It was obvious that Ernie was more of Jim
because Jim was very playful.

734
00:41:49.718 --> 00:41:51.428
Wubba. wubba. Bert.

735
00:41:51.428 --> 00:41:52.762
- You're it. Bert.
- No. I'm not.

736
00:41:52.762 --> 00:41:54.514
Yes. you are. Bert. Bert's it!

737
00:41:57.392 --> 00:41:58.476
Bert is it.

738
00:41:58.476 --> 00:42:01.563
And Bert was me because
I was uptight and neurotic at that time.

739
00:42:01.563 --> 00:42:05.316
Ernie. I am not going to play this game.

740
00:42:05.316 --> 00:42:07.152
- Mmm.
- Angry. right?

741
00:42:07.152 --> 00:42:08.903
Yes. I am angry!

742
00:42:08.903 --> 00:42:11.239
I knew it. Very good.
That's one for Ernie.

743
00:42:11.239 --> 00:42:13.742
[Jim] In the beginning.
Frank didn't like Bert.

744
00:42:13.742 --> 00:42:16.953
In the beginning. Bert--
he-- he felt Bert was too dull.

745
00:42:16.953 --> 00:42:20.290
[Oz] And then I realized. okay.
I'll make the negative a positive.

746
00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.918
And then I created the character
who just want to be left alone and read.

747
00:42:23.918 --> 00:42:26.838
And that allowed for the comic impulses
of Jim to interrupt me.

748
00:42:27.422 --> 00:42:31.843
Twenty-two. Oh. the red one.
Twenty-three. [stammers] Twenty-four.

749
00:42:31.843 --> 00:42:37.599
- Bert. Bert. Bert. Cut. cut. Bert.
- [laughing]

750
00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:41.353
Jim is somebody if he's on the river.
he will pull his paddles in.

751
00:42:42.062 --> 00:42:44.230
and he'll allow the river
to take the boat.

752
00:42:45.357 --> 00:42:49.152
Me. I get in the boat and I go upstream.
[chuckles]

753
00:42:49.152 --> 00:42:51.988
So. we're so different in that area.

754
00:42:51.988 --> 00:42:55.742
And one of the best things about comedy.
from Abbott and Costello on.

755
00:42:55.742 --> 00:42:57.994
is that the characters are opposites.

756
00:42:57.994 --> 00:42:59.704
Pretend like you didn't hear
any of that stuff.

757
00:42:59.704 --> 00:43:01.581
- That was just fine.
- All that stuff you just heard.

758
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:03.249
- you didn't hear that.
- We were kidding around.

759
00:43:03.249 --> 00:43:05.293
[Jim] About half the time
when Frank and I are working.

760
00:43:05.293 --> 00:43:07.045
we decide not to use the script.

761
00:43:07.045 --> 00:43:09.839
And so we're really working spontaneously.

762
00:43:09.839 --> 00:43:11.675
and just sort of
playing off of each other.

763
00:43:11.675 --> 00:43:13.385
And it's a lot of fun.

764
00:43:13.385 --> 00:43:16.221
The opposite of stop is go. Bert.

765
00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:17.972
Go. Bert. go.

766
00:43:17.972 --> 00:43:18.973
Go. Bert!

767
00:43:18.973 --> 00:43:22.310
- Bert. Bert. the opposite of stop--
- [laughing]

768
00:43:25.146 --> 00:43:26.147
At first--

769
00:43:26.147 --> 00:43:30.193
When I came. I was 19.
and I think I used Jim as a father figure.

770
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:32.904
I was unfair to him.

771
00:43:32.904 --> 00:43:36.032
I was dependent and it took a while.

772
00:43:36.032 --> 00:43:38.201
And the more independent I became.

773
00:43:38.201 --> 00:43:40.286
the more we came closer.

774
00:43:40.912 --> 00:43:44.249
- Grover. is that you?
- Mm-hmm. That's right. Froggy. It's me.

775

[stammers] You're a salesman?

776

Uh. you know. you got to do something
to pay the cookie bill.

777
00:43:48.628 --> 00:43:50.964
[Oz] He was my boss. I worked for him.

778
00:43:50.964 --> 00:43:55.343
He paid me. but. I mean.
he never acted like a boss.

779
00:43:55.343 --> 00:43:57.345
Why am I doing it and you're not?

780
00:43:57.345 --> 00:43:59.431
- Because I'm just doing the words now.
- Okay.

781
00:43:59.431 --> 00:44:02.142
[Oz] So it really was a partnership.

782
00:44:04.227 --> 00:44:06.229
Eventually. it was like brothers.

783
00:44:06.229 --> 00:44:08.732

784
00:44:08.732 --> 00:44:11.568

00:44:11.568 --> 00:44:12.485
[growls] Yeah?

786
00:44:12.485 --> 00:44:15.822
- [Oz] A little higher. To the left.
- [chuckles] That's awful.

787
00:44:17.699 --> 00:44:18.950
[Jim] During the '70s.

788
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:22.287
I suppose. the whole country felt
it was slightly in a depression.

789
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.749
Emotional type of depression.

790
00:44:28.335 --> 00:44:30.962
And when you were working
for the preschool kids.

791
00:44:30.962 --> 00:44:32.380
you can't be depressed about that.

792
00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.382
I mean. you know.
this is such a wonderful age.

793
00:44:34.382 --> 00:44:37.719

that you're dealing with.

00:45:59.759 --> 00:46:03.513

the beginning of a whole new life.

00:46:09.436 --> 00:46:12.731

That was the culture.

820
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.984
[Goelz] I was working in Silicon Valley.

821
00:46:15.984 --> 00:46:20.405
One day. I'm sitting in my cubicle.
phone rings and it's Jim Henson.

822
00:46:20.405 --> 00:46:21.948
Sounds like Ernie.

823
00:46:21.948 --> 00:46:24.034
[imitating Ernie]
"Hi. Dave. This is Jim Henson."

824
00:46:24.659 --> 00:46:26.494
[normal voice]
And I thought. "Oh. my God."

825
00:46:27.078 --> 00:46:31.291
[Frith] I was an editor and illustrator
working with Dr. Seuss.

826
00:46:31.291 --> 00:46:33.543
but I was fascinated with <i>Sesame Street</i>.

827
00:46:33.543 --> 00:46:36.296
With the books.
we could reach hundreds of thousands.

828
00:46:36.296 --> 00:46:38.590
But with television.
we could reach millions.

829
00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:42.510
So. I said goodbye to Dr. Seuss
and hello to the Muppets.

830
00:46:43.845 --> 00:46:47.307
It's probably the best group of people
I ever could have walked into.

831
00:46:47.307 --> 00:46:51.811
It was Jim finding these people.
putting them together.

832
00:46:51.811 --> 00:46:54.356
and trusting them
to do what he thought they could do.

833
00:46:54.356 --> 00:46:55.440
It was amazing.

834
00:46:58.568 --> 00:47:00.320
[Jim] All right. guys. Here we go.

835
00:47:03.073 --> 00:47:05.992
[Cheryl] I don't think
he really liked advertising.

836
00:47:05.992 --> 00:47:10.205
and <i>Sesame Street</i> gave him
a really good reason to drop out of it.

837
00:47:10.205 --> 00:47:12.457
He didn't have to do it
to make money anymore.

838

Ribbit. Ribbit.

839
00:47:15.126 --> 00:47:18.380
[Brian] It was a very.
very creative period for him

840
00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.883
the early year or two of <i>Sesame Street</i>.

841
00:47:21.883 --> 00:47:24.969
But then.
definitely the box closed hard around him.

842
00:47:25.595 --> 00:47:28.723
[clock ticking]

843
00:47:30.934 --> 00:47:33.019
[Oz] After a year of <i>Sesame Street</i>.
he felt.

844
00:47:33.019 --> 00:47:35.230
"Oh. my God. I-- I made a big mistake."

845
00:47:36.231 --> 00:47:39.901
[Brian] He was suddenly
America's favorite preschool entertainer.

846
00:47:40.694 --> 00:47:42.445
and that didn't sit comfortably with him.

847
00:47:43.988 --> 00:47:46.991
He had all these ideas.
and then when he became successful.

848
00:47:48.076 --> 00:47:49.077
now was the opportunity.

849
00:47:50.578 --> 00:47:53.164
[Brian] If he had wanted
to do two more kids shows.

850
00:47:53.164 --> 00:47:54.582
it would have been no problem.

851
00:47:54.582 --> 00:47:56.251
He would have sold them in a second.

852
00:47:56.251 --> 00:47:57.335
But he didn't.

853
00:48:02.757 --> 00:48:04.634
[Juhl] He had plans for Broadway shows.

854
00:48:04.634 --> 00:48:08.388
He had plans for ballets.
He had plans for amusement parks.

855
00:48:08.388 --> 00:48:10.306
Lots of things in lots of directions.

[wind whistling]

857
00:48:17.397 --> 00:48:18.648
{\an8}[Heather] He had a great ambition.

858
00:48:18.648 --> 00:48:22.485
and he really wanted to contribute
to the world in a huge way.

859
00:48:24.821 --> 00:48:25.989
One more time.

860
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:30.118
I don't think Jim was ever afraid
of anything creatively.

861
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.332
[Lisa] He kept on trying stuff.

862
00:48:36.332 --> 00:48:39.169
He did <i>Hey. Cinderella</i>. The Frog Prince

863
00:48:39.169 --> 00:48:43.256
and. uh. one that hardly anybody's seen
called the <i>Musicians of Bremen</i>.

864
00:48:43.256 --> 00:48:47.093
And those productions
were where he would work out

865
00:48:47.093 --> 00:48:50.347
a lot of cool. new ideas in his mind.

866
00:48:50.347 --> 00:48:55.143
whether it was figuring out
how to puppeteer the frogs in water.

867
00:48:55.143 --> 00:48:59.064
or how to build puppets
with a different look and feel.

868
00:49:00.648 --> 00:49:03.485
He would work two days on a trot
sometimes without sleeping.

869
00:49:03.485 --> 00:49:04.986
He would do that regularly.

870
00:49:05.779 --> 00:49:07.739
And that was normal for Jim. Normal.

871
00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:12.285
I think it was Jerry Juhl who said
that Jim had a whim of steel.

872
00:49:12.869 --> 00:49:14.871
He was very thin.
and he looked vulnerable.

873
00:49:15.497 --> 00:49:17.290
but he was the toughest one of the bunch.

874
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.502
He was the strongest man I've ever known.

but also that skinny body.

876

My mom was strong and-- and dynamic.

against the concept of the perfect wife.

And. invariably. what would happen was

they'd say either. "Oh. no.
They're puppets." or "Kids' stuff. No."

{\an8}and smile on us and he will say.
"Let them have a 40 share."

980
00:55:31.414 --> 00:55:32.624
I-- I couldn't sell it.

981
00:55:33.249 --> 00:55:34.250
Help.

982
00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.752
It was passed on by everybody.

983
00:55:35.752 --> 00:55:37.379
It was enormously frustrating.

984
00:55:39.339 --> 00:55:42.592
[Lisa] The idea for a Muppets variety show

985
00:55:42.592 --> 00:55:45.887
was quickly replaced
by other things to be busy with.

986
00:55:45.887 --> 00:55:48.640
[theme song playing]

987
00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.934
[announcer] NBC's Saturday Night.

988
00:55:53.144 --> 00:55:55.438
<i>With Jim Henson's Muppets.</i>

989
00:55:57.065 --> 00:55:59.776
[Brian] The most adult show
that has ever been made... [chuckles]

990
00:55:59.776 --> 00:56:03.029
...is the way <i>Saturday Night Live</i> was being
set up. And he was like. "I want in."

991
00:56:03.905 --> 00:56:04.906
{\an8}Scred?

992
00:56:04.906 --> 00:56:08.743
{\an8}Yes. oh. High Supreme Mucky-Muck. sir.

993
00:56:08.743 --> 00:56:10.328
Scred. I'm hungry.

994
00:56:10.328 --> 00:56:13.915
Ah. what would please your flatulence?

995
00:56:13.915 --> 00:56:15.041
[groans]

996
00:56:15.041 --> 00:56:20.797
{\an8}That was a great example of
two completely different groups of people

997
00:56:20.797 --> 00:56:25.552
{\an8}with completely different styles
of comedy clashing together.

998
00:56:25.552 --> 00:56:27.595
We weren't allowed
to write our own material.

999
00:56:27.595 --> 00:56:28.847
[groans]

1000
00:56:28.847 --> 00:56:30.932
It was their show.
and we were taking up time.

1001
00:56:30.932 --> 00:56:34.728
{\an8}Michael O'Donoghue could not say
a good thing about the Muppets.

1002
00:56:34.728 --> 00:56:38.773
{\an8}He despised them.
"I hated writing for that felt."

1003
00:56:38.773 --> 00:56:41.401
We were all pretty sorry
to hear you guys got canceled. Scred.

1004
00:56:41.401 --> 00:56:43.028
But. uh. you know. that's show business.

1005
00:56:43.028 --> 00:56:46.406
It was not a happy experience.
It really wasn't.

1006
00:56:47.574 --> 00:56:51.036
It was halfway through that season
that he got a call from London.

1007
00:56:53.705 --> 00:56:54.956
[phone rings]

1008
00:56:54.956 --> 00:56:57.250
So one of the last two
<i>Saturday Night Live</i> shows we did.

1009
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.960
Jim pulled me over and say.

1010
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:02.047
"Hey. listen. We just got
24 half-hour guaranteed shows."

1011
00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:06.593
{\an8}Lew Grade had ATV Studios in London.
which was empty.

1012
00:57:06.593 --> 00:57:09.220
He wasn't shooting anything there.
so he needed something to shoot there.

1013
00:57:10.138 --> 00:57:14.142
[Brian] It was two of
the most ambitious men on the planet.

1014
00:57:14.142 --> 00:57:17.103
and they come from
two completely different universes.

1015
00:57:17.103 --> 00:57:19.773
[Oz] Lew used to be a Charleston dancer.

1016
00:57:19.773 --> 00:57:23.485
Then he became
this very successful producer.

1017
00:57:23.485 --> 00:57:28.490
He was absolutely
the greatest financial sponsor

1018
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:31.826
that my dad could have had
because he gave him so much freedom.

1019
00:57:31.826 --> 00:57:32.952
Lew would always say.

1020
00:57:32.952 --> 00:57:35.246
"Okay. if it felt right. let's do it.
Here's the money."

1021
00:57:35.246 --> 00:57:37.540
As opposed to today.
you go to a committee.

1022
00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.710
It was just visceral for Lew.
and he trusted himself.

1023
00:57:41.628 --> 00:57:44.839
[Brian] Lew was very bullish
about this plan

1024
00:57:44.839 --> 00:57:48.510
of selling back into little.
local TV channels across the country.

1025
00:57:49.469 --> 00:57:52.722
So we said. "Okay. well.
that's a way to get it on the air anyhow."

1026
00:57:52.722 --> 00:57:54.724
And so we went over to England.

1027
00:57:57.936 --> 00:58:00.939
[military band playing]

1028
00:58:03.525 --> 00:58:05.694
[Lisa] The whole crew went over there.

1029
00:58:05.694 --> 00:58:09.781
and they were working with
British directors. with British writers.

1030
00:58:09.781 --> 00:58:11.408
It was a big collaboration.

1031
00:58:11.408 --> 00:58:14.035
and nobody really knew
what was gonna come out of it.

1032
00:58:14.035 --> 00:58:15.328
[chattering]

1033
00:58:15.328 --> 00:58:18.832
[Juhl] We started frantically trying.
grasping around.

1034
00:58:18.832 --> 00:58:22.127
trying to find characters
and ideas and concepts

1035
00:58:22.127 --> 00:58:25.088
that would fit with this basic shape
that Jim had put to the show.

1036
00:58:29.509 --> 00:58:32.178
We knew we wanted a comedian.
and that he was gonna be a bear.

1037
00:58:32.178 --> 00:58:33.930
That's about all we knew about him.

1038
00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:35.515
And we knew that Gonzo the Great

1039
00:58:35.515 --> 00:58:38.518
was a guy who thought that
eating a tire to music was great art.

1040
00:58:41.396 --> 00:58:45.567
Jim gradually hit upon this idea
based on old English music hall.

1041
00:58:45.567 --> 00:58:47.360
[piano playing]

1042
00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.697
I mean. there's a lot of influence.
the way that theater looks.

1043
00:58:52.407 --> 00:58:55.827
{\an8}All we were doing is taking a chance
with 24 episodes.

1044
00:58:56.411 --> 00:59:02.250
{\an8}I had no idea that it would be
such an extraordinary. phenomenal success.

1045
00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:03.543

of the "Flight of the Bumblebee."

- Music. maestro.

- Yes.

...you will just wait
until I say the word "here."

1068
01:00:09.442 --> 01:00:13.571
When you hear me say the word "here."
you will rush up to me and say.

1069
01:00:13.571 --> 01:00:16.199
"Good grief. the comedian's a bear."

01:00:16.199 --> 01:00:18.535
- Good grief. the comedian's a bear.
- Check.

- When you say the word "here."
- Right.

- Gotcha.
- Okay.

1073
01:00:21.496 --> 01:00:24.416
He's doing it. He's eating a tire.

- Boring.

Hiya. hiya. hiya!
You're a wonderful-looking audience.

It's a pleasure to be here.

01:00:32.882 --> 01:00:33.967
Not yet!

1079
01:00:35.093 --> 01:00:37.721
- You just said "here."
- That was the wrong "here."

1080
01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:40.056
- Which is the right "here"?
- The other "here."

1081
01:00:40.056 --> 01:00:40.974
Sure.

1082
01:00:40.974 --> 01:00:42.267

Hey. hey. folks.
This is a story you're gonna love to hear.

1086
01:00:54.362 --> 01:00:57.198
- Good grief. the comedian's a bear!
- Will you stop it?

1087
01:00:57.198 --> 01:00:58.867
- But you said "here."
- Not that "here."

1088
01:00:58.867 --> 01:01:00.618
- Well. which "here"?
- Another "here."

1089
01:01:00.618 --> 01:01:03.163
- How am I gonna know?
- You'll know when you hear!

1090
01:01:03.163 --> 01:01:05.331
- Good grief. the comedian's a bear!
- Not--

1091
01:01:05.331 --> 01:01:06.958
[audience laughing]

1092
01:01:09.919 --> 01:01:13.757
[Oz] The concept was these bizarre people
trying to put on a show every week

1093
01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:15.175
[screams]

1094
01:01:15.175 --> 01:01:18.970
Next on stage. Prince Rudolph
and His Invisible Cheeseburger.

1095
01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:22.724
I'm sorry. guys. I've got a full show.

Way to go. samurai.
To your dressing-- [shouts]

1098
01:01:26.728 --> 01:01:30.065
[Oz] And this poor frog
trying to make it happen every damn week.

1099
01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:33.151
Everybody's onstage for the opera
except the spear carriers.

1100
01:01:33.151 --> 01:01:34.569
They want more money.

1101
01:01:34.569 --> 01:01:35.653
No way.

1102
01:01:37.489 --> 01:01:39.657
- Uh. see how much they want.
- Right.

1103
01:01:39.657 --> 01:01:42.994
Kermit's function on this show
is very much like my own.

1104
01:01:42.994 --> 01:01:47.374
in that he's trying to hold together
this group of crazies.

1105
01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:49.000
And that's not unlike what I do.

1106
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.169
The Muppet Glee Club. "Temptation."

1107
01:01:51.836 --> 01:01:54.005
One and two and...

1108
01:01:54.005 --> 01:01:58.259
[singing]

1109
01:01:58.259 --> 01:02:01.429
[Jim] And the very first show.
we had a. sort of. an animal chorus.

1110
01:02:01.971 --> 01:02:03.223
<i>♪ You came ♪</i>

1111
01:02:03.223 --> 01:02:04.808
[Jim] Kermit was conducting...

1112
01:02:04.808 --> 01:02:06.518
<i>♪ I was alone ♪</i>

1113
01:02:06.518 --> 01:02:10.689
[Jim] ...and this one pig came forward
to sing the solo in "Temptation."

1114
01:02:10.689 --> 01:02:13.858
<i>♪ Born to be kissed ♪</i>

1115
01:02:14.734 --> 01:02:17.445
<i>♪ I can't resist ♪</i>

1116
01:02:17.445 --> 01:02:21.366
<i>♪ You are temptation ♪</i>

1117
01:02:21.366 --> 01:02:22.701
<i>♪ And I... ♪</i>

1118
01:02:22.701 --> 01:02:25.203
[Jim] And so she was
sort of coming on to the conductor.

1119
01:02:26.287 --> 01:02:29.958
So that really started that-- the
whole relationship in that little moment.

1120
01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:36.297
<i>♪ Only a slave ♪</i>

1121
01:02:36.297 --> 01:02:39.384
<i>♪ To you ♪</i>

1122
01:02:39.384 --> 01:02:43.471
One show in rehearsal.
it said for Piggy to slap Kermit.

1123
01:02:44.597 --> 01:02:49.185
And. for some reason. I don't know why.
I karate chopped him instead.

1124
01:02:49.185 --> 01:02:50.687
- Hi-yah!
- [grunts]

1125
01:02:50.687 --> 01:02:52.772
- [audience laughs]
- [Oz] And Jim went with it.

1126
01:02:52.772 --> 01:02:54.274
Barbarian.

1127
01:02:55.108 --> 01:02:55.942
[thuds]

1128
01:02:55.942 --> 01:02:58.987
It is a lightbulb that--
Okay. I know her character now.

1129
01:02:58.987 --> 01:03:00.238
- I'll show you.
- What--

1130
01:03:00.238 --> 01:03:01.906
- Hi-yah!
- Piggy-- [shouts]

1131
01:03:01.906 --> 01:03:03.742
- Hi-yah!
- [screams]

1132
01:03:03.742 --> 01:03:05.035
- Hi-yah!
- [laughs]

1133
01:03:05.035 --> 01:03:06.536
- Hi-yah!
- [shouts]

1134
01:03:07.245 --> 01:03:09.914
So Piggy was plucked from the chorus
and became a star.

1135
01:03:09.914 --> 01:03:11.082
Hello. Morley.

1136
01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:14.336
- May I ask you a question? Please?
- [chuckling] Yes.

1137
01:03:14.336 --> 01:03:16.546
- Is your wife here?
- No. she's not.

1138
01:03:16.546 --> 01:03:18.798
- Great.
- [chuckles]

1139
01:03:18.798 --> 01:03:21.259

- [person] Yeah. right.

1140
01:03:21.259 --> 01:03:24.137
- He's just overwhelmed by your beauty.
- Could've fooled me.

1141
01:03:24.137 --> 01:03:25.388
All right. That's a wrap.

1142
01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:32.479
She has so many limitations.

1143
01:03:32.479 --> 01:03:34.647
All she can do is have bravado.

1144
01:03:35.231 --> 01:03:36.858
Okay. Piggy. you were good.

1145
01:03:36.858 --> 01:03:38.651
I was great.

1146
01:03:40.195 --> 01:03:43.740
[Oz] She covers all her pain
'cause she knows she's not talented.

1147
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:46.117
She knows she can't tell jokes.

1148
01:03:46.117 --> 01:03:47.702
She knows she can't dance.

1149
01:03:47.702 --> 01:03:50.413
I'm too delicate for show business.

1150
01:03:50.413 --> 01:03:53.750
[Oz] And. of course. her magnificent
obsession in life is the frog.

1151
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:56.753
And he is just
kind of namby-pamby about her.

1152
01:03:56.753 --> 01:04:00.006
That comedic conflict.
I think that's what makes it memorable.

Well. actually. I didn't ask you.

1175
01:04:54.936 --> 01:04:56.604
It was both a joy and a grind.

01:05:02.318 --> 01:05:04.237
[Oz] We do a show a week.

1180
01:05:04.237 --> 01:05:06.906
Every number we do
has to go through the same stages.

1181
01:05:06.906 --> 01:05:08.783
We have the guest star on a Sunday.

1182
01:05:09.367 --> 01:05:12.537
We do a read through.
we do rehearsal. we go through music.

1184
01:05:14.247 --> 01:05:15.832

we record the band.

[band playing]

1186
01:05:18.001 --> 01:05:19.711
And then the vocals are laid down.

1187
01:05:21.004 --> 01:05:22.672

And we had everything raised.

1198
01:05:46.821 --> 01:05:49.949
We would have the floor
in. like. three-foot sections.

1199
01:05:49.949 --> 01:05:52.660
We'd be underneath.
and then we'd have our hands up.

01:05:53.745 --> 01:05:56.122

1206
01:06:09.844 --> 01:06:13.973
[Jim] The concept of taking and designing
the show around a guest star each week.

1207
01:06:13.973 --> 01:06:15.767
uh. worked out very nicely too.

1208
01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:18.978
Each guest would come in. and the whole
show would change personalities.

It's just not something Jim did.

I don't know that it was shyness.

{\an8}Jim was a reticent person
when it came to communicating with people.

He never gave long and detailed answers.

01:11:46.723 --> 01:11:49.392
And so I-- It's just a natural decision
to do a movie.

1303
01:11:50.143 --> 01:11:51.644
{\an8}[cameraperson] And zooming.

1304
01:11:51.644 --> 01:11:53.730
{\an8}[Jim] Jim Frawley. who was the director.

1305
01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:57.901
{\an8}at first. he wanted to shoot in studio.
create a world like <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.

1306
01:11:57.901 --> 01:12:00.153
And I was really trying to talk him
into shooting outdoors.

1307
01:12:00.153 --> 01:12:02.906
I said. "Come on over."
He brought a Super 8 camera.

1308
01:12:02.906 --> 01:12:05.658
and we shot footage of--
of the characters outdoors.

1309
01:12:06.368 --> 01:12:08.661
{\an8}[Oz] Jim Frawley
didn't really get the Muppets.

1310
01:12:08.661 --> 01:12:13.458
{\an8}and he wasn't sure if they really would
work on the big screen and in real life.

1311
01:12:13.458 --> 01:12:15.293
- I apologize for that.
- [Fozzie Bear] Hey. Kermit.

1312
01:12:15.293 --> 01:12:17.128
Look at the windshield wipers.
Look at them go.

1313
01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:20.423
Isn't that terrific?
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1314
01:12:21.007 --> 01:12:24.010
Uh. excuse me. guys.
We're looking for Hollywood.

1315
01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:25.929
Uh. Hollywood. California.

1316
01:12:25.929 --> 01:12:28.473
No. it's-- it's over near Los Angeles.

1317
01:12:28.473 --> 01:12:31.559
Do you-- Have you ever been to Lo--
Have you ever been to Lo-- Excuse me.

1318
01:12:31.559 --> 01:12:32.519
[laughs]

1319
01:12:32.519 --> 01:12:33.770
[screams]

1320
01:12:34.813 --> 01:12:36.564
Jim. of course. knew it'd work.

1321
01:12:39.859 --> 01:12:43.071
For the opening scene of the movie.
we were shooting Kermit in a swamp.

1322
01:12:43.071 --> 01:12:45.365
[no audible dialogue]

1323
01:12:47.492 --> 01:12:51.746
Jim had to be squeezed
into this steel canister under the water.

1324
01:12:56.292 --> 01:12:57.502
When they finally let him out.

1325
01:12:57.502 --> 01:12:59.838
it took him about 20 minutes
to get unfolded.

1326
01:13:03.675 --> 01:13:05.343
But Jim wouldn't think twice.

1327
01:13:06.136 --> 01:13:07.721
[projector clicks. whirs]

1328
01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:10.306
["Rainbow Connection" playing]

1329
01:13:10.306 --> 01:13:12.434
[Jim] It's the Muppets meeting the world.

[Juhl] <i>The Muppet Movie</i>
opened us up into a whole new world

1340
01:13:55.643 --> 01:13:58.313
that allowed us a whole emotional range.

1341
01:14:01.566 --> 01:14:05.278
It afforded him chances to do more things.
to fulfill more dreams.

1342
01:14:05.278 --> 01:14:06.780
to go off in a different direction.

1343
01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.491
He knew that he could pick up the phone
and call anybody.

1344
01:14:09.491 --> 01:14:11.659
and the best people in the world
in any given field

1345
01:14:11.659 --> 01:14:14.162
would be willing to listen to him
because he was Jim Henson.

1346
01:14:14.162 --> 01:14:16.331
Just look at all this. Boy!

1347
01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.792
How did a frog make the big time?

1348
01:14:19.626 --> 01:14:21.461
- [static]
- [chattering]

1349
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:25.382
- Do you know me? I created the Muppets.
- [all] Big deal!

1350
01:14:25.382 --> 01:14:27.550
Everybody knows them. but not me.

1351
01:14:28.343 --> 01:14:31.096
So when I travel.
I carry the American Express card.

1352
01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:33.932
{\an8}[Brian] And from that point on.

1353
01:14:33.932 --> 01:14:36.851
my dad couldn't walk a block
without getting recognized.

1354
01:14:43.316 --> 01:14:46.736
[Lisa] He bought a new building
on 69th Street in New York City.

1355
01:14:46.736 --> 01:14:50.240
Much lovelier. fancier headquarters.

1356
01:14:51.366 --> 01:14:55.787
{\an8}And all of a sudden he's wearing
a much more fashionable kind of wardrobe.

1357
01:14:56.955 --> 01:14:58.957
California cowboy chic.

1358
01:15:00.291 --> 01:15:05.296
[Lisa] He got a Lotus
with custom green paint in Kermit color...

1359
01:15:07.966 --> 01:15:09.634
and he started new parts of the business.

1360
01:15:09.634 --> 01:15:13.847
He had his own merchandising department
and distribution.

1361
01:15:13.847 --> 01:15:17.017
and everything
was getting a little bit bigger.

1362
01:15:18.893 --> 01:15:21.896
[interviewer] <i>The Muppet Show</i>.
<i>Sesame Street.</i> the movie.

1363
01:15:21.896 --> 01:15:25.275
the bits and pieces of Muppetry.
the whole Muppet empire.

1364
01:15:25.275 --> 01:15:27.610
- What's it worth?
- [laughs]

1365
01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:30.071
I have no idea. I really don't.

1366
01:15:30.071 --> 01:15:32.615
- [Jim laughs]
- [interviewer] Scores of millions?

1367
01:15:32.615 --> 01:15:34.701
- [Jim] Oh. no. No.
- Millions?

1368
01:15:35.744 --> 01:15:38.163
Probably. but I wouldn't swear to that.

1369
01:15:38.955 --> 01:15:40.790
Yeah. [chuckles]

1370
01:15:41.332 --> 01:15:45.420
[Brian] Becoming famous
was definitely what he wanted.

1371
01:15:46.087 --> 01:15:50.925
But I could see and feel that
there was an innocence getting lost.

1372
01:15:51.593 --> 01:15:55.096
and that it was gonna impact
his relationship with us and everything.

1373
01:15:55.096 --> 01:15:56.931
And that was complex.

1374
01:15:59.517 --> 01:16:02.187
[Jane] This kind of success
has less peace in it.

1375
01:16:02.187 --> 01:16:05.565
It's. um. troublesome in many ways.

1376
01:16:05.565 --> 01:16:08.902
There's a lot of work.
a lot of separation.

1377
01:16:08.902 --> 01:16:10.236
There's a lot of pressure

1378
01:16:10.236 --> 01:16:14.074
in a success that involves
so many people and so much money.

1379
01:16:15.325 --> 01:16:20.163
He was also trying to commute back
and forth between New York and London.

1380
01:16:20.997 --> 01:16:23.875
That was challenging
because <i>The Muppet Show</i>

1381
01:16:23.875 --> 01:16:26.211
would tape months on end in London.

1382
01:16:26.211 --> 01:16:29.381
And then when he would get to New York.
everybody needed his attention.

1383
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:31.091
whether it was on the family side.

1384
01:16:31.091 --> 01:16:35.387
or even at the company needing more
leadership and more of his presence.

1385
01:16:35.387 --> 01:16:39.557
So there was stress involved
with getting bigger. for sure.

1386
01:16:40.225 --> 01:16:42.394
You're a very busy man.
How do you find enough time

1387
01:16:42.394 --> 01:16:47.107
to spend with your family to keep
those home fires burning. let's say?

1388
01:16:47.107 --> 01:16:51.194
You know. it-- it is difficult.
and certainly I-- I. um--

1389
01:16:51.194 --> 01:16:52.612
But I like to travel with them.

1390
01:16:52.612 --> 01:16:56.032
I often. you know. have one or two
of my kids with me at the time.

1391
01:16:56.032 --> 01:16:59.452
and. uh. we enjoy family vacations
and that sort of thing.

1392
01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:01.746
Come on. everybody. Try it.

1393
01:17:03.623 --> 01:17:07.043
[Goelz] And meanwhile. Jim is still
doing <i>Sesame</i> several weeks a year.

1394
01:17:07.544 --> 01:17:10.005
He felt completely committed
to service <i>Sesame Street</i>

1395
01:17:10.005 --> 01:17:11.131
and not leave them behind.

1396
01:17:11.131 --> 01:17:12.382
[chattering]

1397
01:17:12.382 --> 01:17:15.218
[Cheryl] My dad was
working incredibly hard.

1398
01:17:16.177 --> 01:17:20.432
And. regularly. at the end of each week.
they'd have. like. one day off.

1399
01:17:20.432 --> 01:17:21.599
And he would be sick.

1400
01:17:21.599 --> 01:17:25.979
He would just crash.
and then he'd have to get back up and go.

1401
01:17:27.939 --> 01:17:31.276
[Oz] We always said. "Oh.
Jim is taking on too much this time."

1402
01:17:32.027 --> 01:17:35.030
If there was a week off in London.

1403
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:37.657
he'd say. "Hey. we're doing the Queen's
Silver Jubilee during that week."

1404
01:17:37.657 --> 01:17:38.742
[chuckles]

1405
01:17:39.659 --> 01:17:42.287
[no audible dialogue]

1406
01:17:42.287 --> 01:17:43.788
He wasn't against doctors.

1407
01:17:43.788 --> 01:17:45.999
He just didn't want
to go to doctors first.

1408
01:17:45.999 --> 01:17:49.961
I remember doing a shoot with him
in Chicago out in the dead winter.

1409
01:17:49.961 --> 01:17:51.880
and he-- he had walking pneumonia.

1410
01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.049
And he just barreled through.

1411
01:17:58.011 --> 01:17:59.596
He-- He wasn't scared of dying.

1412
01:18:02.223 --> 01:18:06.478
I-I remember when Don Sahlin died.
which was a huge shock.

1413
01:18:08.021 --> 01:18:11.858
and I was in the workshop
and I was crying.

1414
01:18:13.109 --> 01:18:16.112
And Jim came behind me
and said. "It's okay.

1415
01:18:16.112 --> 01:18:17.614
He's just on a different plane."

1416
01:18:19.115 --> 01:18:20.533
And Jim believed that.

1417
01:18:20.533 --> 01:18:22.369
He saw it as another adventure.

1418
01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.622
He believed there was
something else there.

1419
01:18:27.457 --> 01:18:32.295
[Cheryl] He was interested in Buddhism.
TM. Transcendental Meditation.

1420
01:18:32.295 --> 01:18:34.547
different ways of seeing the world.

1421
01:18:35.799 --> 01:18:38.968
What is reality? What is human nature?

1422
01:18:38.968 --> 01:18:41.388
What is this world that surrounds us?

1423
01:18:43.014 --> 01:18:44.599
[laughing]

1424
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.312
[Lisa] My father never spoke of God.

1425
01:18:49.312 --> 01:18:53.358
and he was not a Christian Scientist.
in spite of his mother.

1426
01:18:53.358 --> 01:18:57.946
He was the kind of person
who just believes in the greater power.

1427
01:18:57.946 --> 01:19:02.450
and a very intense interconnectedness
between all beings.

1428
01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.249
[Erickson] Jim was always trying
to broaden his mind. his sensibilities.

1429
01:19:10.959 --> 01:19:12.293
He was a seeker.

1430
01:19:18.925 --> 01:19:23.596
- [laughing. chattering]
- [band playing]

1431
01:19:27.142 --> 01:19:29.602
[no audible dialogue]

1432
01:19:29.602 --> 01:19:33.565
[applause]

1433
01:19:36.276 --> 01:19:37.277
Uh...

1434
01:19:37.819 --> 01:19:40.488
- I don't really make speeches. uh...
- [guests laugh]

1435
01:19:40.488 --> 01:19:42.490
...as-- as everybody knows.

1436
01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:46.745
But. uh. listen. it's been
really a great five years. And I'm not...

1437
01:19:46.745 --> 01:19:49.414
[Brian] After five seasons.
he was like. "I did it all.

1438
01:19:49.414 --> 01:19:52.208
I did <i>The Muppet Show</i>.
I'm gonna start repeating myself."

1439
01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:53.126
And he canceled it.

1440
01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:56.921
We're proud of the work
that we've done together.

1441
01:19:56.921 --> 01:19:59.049
All of you people and all of us.

1442
01:19:59.049 --> 01:20:02.969
And. uh. it's stuff that will.
uh. stay with me a long time.

1443
01:20:02.969 --> 01:20:05.221
So. thank you very much.

1444
01:20:05.221 --> 01:20:07.474
[applause]

1445
01:20:09.309 --> 01:20:11.978
[Brian] Nobody does that
with a show that successful.

1446
01:20:13.313 --> 01:20:15.982
But he had the next chapter
already in his head.

1447
01:20:18.568 --> 01:20:21.446
[Jim] Sometimes you feel
you should continue moving forward.

1448
01:20:22.113 --> 01:20:23.156
From a creative standpoint.

1449
01:20:23.156 --> 01:20:26.076
it's a lot more interesting to change
and do something different and new.

1450
01:20:31.456 --> 01:20:32.957
[Brian] <i>Dark Crystal</i>
was really the beginning

1451
01:20:32.957 --> 01:20:35.460
of this next chapter of creativity.

1452
01:20:40.715 --> 01:20:42.300
[Jim] We intended to do something

1453
01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.387
that would jump styles completely
from the Muppets.

1454
01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:49.182
And about the same time
we started thinking about it.

1455
01:20:49.182 --> 01:20:51.351
I saw the work of Brian Froud.

1456
01:20:52.602 --> 01:20:54.270
And I immediately loved it.

1457
01:20:57.148 --> 01:21:01.861
It's a wonderful challenge to design
the creatures and what they wear.

1458
01:21:02.445 --> 01:21:06.366
the castle and the landscape
and the color palette of the skies.

1459
01:21:09.369 --> 01:21:11.746
[Oz] Jim needed a shop.

1460
01:21:11.746 --> 01:21:15.959
So he bought a place in Hampstead.
an old derelict post office.

1461
01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:18.461
And that became the creature shop.

1462
01:21:22.924 --> 01:21:24.217
[Erickson] Jim was a detail person.

1463
01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:28.096
He would say.
"Go ahead and stitch that three times.

1464
01:21:28.096 --> 01:21:32.559
and do a handmade embroidery
because that'll just enrich it."

1465
01:21:33.977 --> 01:21:38.982
[Brian] He just started collecting artists
into this building in London.

1466
01:21:39.607 --> 01:21:42.235
So that's when he named it
the Jim Henson Creature Shop.

1467
01:21:42.235 --> 01:21:43.653
So it was literally a shop

1468
01:21:43.653 --> 01:21:46.322
where you can come
and buy your creature for your movie.

1469
01:21:47.157 --> 01:21:50.201
{\an8}[Frith] Jim loved the technology
involved in all of this.

1470
01:21:50.201 --> 01:21:55.040
{\an8}This extraordinarily complex system
of moving mouths and eyes and eyebrows

1471
01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:58.543
and wiggling ears. and anything else
that you needed to have a puppet do.

1472
01:21:59.461 --> 01:22:02.881
It was an interesting challenge
because these puppets were unwieldy.

1473
01:22:02.881 --> 01:22:05.800
and they were also capable
of nuance and subtlety

1474
01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:08.178
that we didn't have
in the regular Muppets.

1475
01:22:08.178 --> 01:22:12.098
There were mechanisms on the characters
that made them mimic life more closely.

1476
01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:14.434
[Jim] The images in the shirt
have to be vertical

1477
01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:16.811
because that--
that's the kind of shape we're going into.

1478
01:22:16.811 --> 01:22:18.480
Certainly not three. and probably not two.

1479
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.065
[Oz] It was getting closer to the shoot.

1480
01:22:20.065 --> 01:22:22.525
And in his own quiet way.
Jim just said to me.

1481
01:22:22.525 --> 01:22:25.403
"Frank. do you want
to direct this movie with me?" [chuckles]

1482
01:22:25.987 --> 01:22:30.408
I said... [stammers] ..."I've never
directed before. Why-- Why ask me?"

1483
01:22:30.408 --> 01:22:32.452
And this is typical Jim. He said.

1484
01:22:32.452 --> 01:22:34.037
"Because it would be better."

1485
01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:38.750
He knew that I had some strengths
that he didn't have.

1486
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:39.834
[no audible dialogue]

1487
01:22:39.834 --> 01:22:41.086
And that's always Jim.

1488
01:22:41.086 --> 01:22:43.380
[no audible dialogue]

1489
01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:48.551
The reaction of him
hitting that stone should be nice.

1490
01:22:48.551 --> 01:22:51.638
[Lisa] They were in the creative sandbox
the whole way through.

1491
01:22:51.638 --> 01:22:53.473
Everything was something new.

1492
01:22:56.768 --> 01:23:00.105
[Goelz] First day we shot.
Jim had 30 or 40 people

1493
01:23:00.105 --> 01:23:02.524
in this uncomfortable position
in the dark...

1494
01:23:04.693 --> 01:23:06.945
on a 2-foot-high platform.

1495
01:23:08.238 --> 01:23:12.325
And I step off the platform.
and now we're going over.

1496
01:23:12.325 --> 01:23:16.663
And somebody caught us.
and put us back on the platform.

1497
01:23:16.663 --> 01:23:18.331
[chuckling]

1498
01:23:18.331 --> 01:23:20.041
And I remember thinking

1499
01:23:20.041 --> 01:23:23.545
Jim's optimism has really gotten
the best of him this time.

1500
01:23:24.879 --> 01:23:26.006
Ah!

1501
01:23:26.006 --> 01:23:29.217
[crew] And one. two. three. action!

1502
01:23:29.217 --> 01:23:33.471
[performers shouting]

1503
01:23:33.471 --> 01:23:35.890
[crew] One. two. three. action.

1504
01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:38.393
Uh. Mr. Oz.
how do you think the picture is going?

1505
01:23:38.393 --> 01:23:39.352
[laughing]

1506
01:23:39.352 --> 01:23:40.770
Mr. Oz doesn't say much about that.

1507
01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:45.108
[crew 2] ...and one. two. three!

1508
01:23:51.156 --> 01:23:52.741
[Brian] The first time
he showed the movie.

1509
01:23:52.741 --> 01:23:56.327
the executives all got up and walked out
of the theater without talking to him.

1510
01:23:56.327 --> 01:23:58.371
They so disliked the movie. [chuckles]

1511
01:23:58.371 --> 01:24:01.124
Fools! Skeksis fools!

1512
01:24:01.124 --> 01:24:02.625
What do you want with me?

1513
01:24:02.625 --> 01:24:07.297
Well. a large portion of the movie was not
in English. was in made-up languages.

1514
01:24:07.297 --> 01:24:09.632
[babbling]

1515
01:24:09.632 --> 01:24:13.345
When the characters were
just babbling nonsense words.

1516
01:24:13.345 --> 01:24:15.930
the test audiences rejected it completely.

1517
01:24:15.930 --> 01:24:21.311
So they had to go back
and create a script in English

1518
01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:23.813
that would fit with the lip sync
of what they had shot.

1519
01:24:23.813 --> 01:24:25.607
[screams]

1520
01:24:25.607 --> 01:24:29.235
[Jim] That entire film was almost
rewritten twice after we shot it.

1521
01:24:29.235 --> 01:24:30.362
Oh!

1522
01:24:30.362 --> 01:24:32.072
Something I don't recommend to anybody.

1523
01:24:32.072 --> 01:24:33.073
...my home.

1524
01:24:33.073 --> 01:24:36.326
[Jim] We ended up
just loading the thing with dialogue.

1525
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:38.661
And. in many ways. I slightly regret...

1526
01:24:38.661 --> 01:24:40.914
Oh. how crude.

1527
01:24:40.914 --> 01:24:44.084
<i>Dark Crystal</i> came out
about the same time as <i>ET</i>.

1528
01:24:44.751 --> 01:24:48.171
And <i>ET</i> had one character in it.
one fantasy character.

1529
01:24:48.171 --> 01:24:49.589
and the rest of the world was real.

1530
01:24:49.589 --> 01:24:51.007
[both screaming]

1531
01:24:51.007 --> 01:24:52.550
You just had to believe that character.

1532
01:24:53.134 --> 01:24:55.512
<i>Dark Crystal</i>.
we had to believe everything.

1533
01:24:56.554 --> 01:25:00.016
[Oz] When Jim believed in something.
he will go all the way.

1534
01:25:02.185 --> 01:25:05.939
It wasn't a huge hit.
but it was successful.

1535
01:25:07.023 --> 01:25:10.235
A one-of-a-kind piece of work
that was artistic for him.

1536
01:25:10.235 --> 01:25:12.946
and got back to his experimental roots.

1537
01:25:19.994 --> 01:25:21.579
[crew] 754. take six.

1538
01:25:21.579 --> 01:25:24.666
[Heather] My dad wasn't really
living in the house at that time.

1539
01:25:24.666 --> 01:25:25.583
Oh. hello.

1540
01:25:25.583 --> 01:25:28.086
He was living
wherever the productions were.

1541
01:25:28.086 --> 01:25:29.379
[interviewer] Tell me what you're doing

1542
01:25:29.379 --> 01:25:31.172
for my friends at home
I'm gonna show this to.

1543
01:25:31.172 --> 01:25:34.342
- What are you doing?
- This is underneath the first Muppet orgy.

1544
01:25:34.342 --> 01:25:36.511
[laughing]

1545
01:25:36.511 --> 01:25:37.595
We just tighten up.

1546
01:25:37.595 --> 01:25:40.140
[Heather] My mom didn't want to live
where the productions were.

1547
01:25:41.182 --> 01:25:43.018
She wanted to live in a stable house.

1548
01:25:46.896 --> 01:25:49.733
I think they might have been done
on my 18th birthday.

1549
01:25:49.733 --> 01:25:52.110
I was in boarding school.
so they saw me the least.

1550
01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:55.864
And for my birthday they said.
"Why don't you come to Toronto?"

1551
01:25:55.864 --> 01:25:57.532
They had a conference or something.

1552
01:25:57.532 --> 01:26:01.119
So I went to spend one night with them.
which was my birthday.

1553
01:26:01.119 --> 01:26:04.706
and they fought all night
in a hotel room next to my room.

1554
01:26:04.706 --> 01:26:06.541
And I thought. "Oh. they're done."

1555
01:26:08.626 --> 01:26:10.295
And then they pretty much were done.

1556
01:26:13.131 --> 01:26:17.552
I knew they had tough times.
I didn't know it could be this tough.

1557
01:26:21.556 --> 01:26:25.560
[Lisa] They had such different
emotional realities.

1558
01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:28.271
He'd be like. "Hey.
everything's great the way that it is."

1559
01:26:28.271 --> 01:26:30.273
and she was taking it very hard.

1560
01:26:30.273 --> 01:26:34.736
So their whole worldview was dividing.

1561
01:26:38.156 --> 01:26:42.702
He got an apartment in New York City
at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.

1562
01:26:45.372 --> 01:26:48.375
[Brian] So there he was.
late 40s heading into his 50s.

1563
01:26:48.375 --> 01:26:51.961
and what he wanted
was to be single but dating.

1564
01:26:52.754 --> 01:26:57.509
He really liked the idea of dating
and not having it become too serious.

1565
01:26:59.511 --> 01:27:02.180
[Lisa] Eventually.
in the legal separation.

1566
01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:04.891
they did change
the ownership of the company.

1567
01:27:05.725 --> 01:27:09.020
A lot of my mom's shares came to us kids.

1568
01:27:11.523 --> 01:27:15.485
While my father was
going through that with my mom.

1569
01:27:15.485 --> 01:27:19.322
Lord Grade sold his company
to Marble Arch.

1570
01:27:20.782 --> 01:27:23.034
And they both were really worried

1571
01:27:23.034 --> 01:27:26.413
'cause all of a sudden
<i>The Muppet Show</i>. the Muppet movies

1572
01:27:26.413 --> 01:27:30.667
{\an8}and <i>The Dark Crystal</i> were all gonna be
owned by this company that he didn't know.

1573
01:27:30.667 --> 01:27:33.503
This was a pretty big
turning point for him.

1574
01:27:33.503 --> 01:27:35.714
and he made a big. big gamble.

1575
01:27:35.714 --> 01:27:39.884
He basically borrowed every penny he could
and mortgaged everything.

1576
01:27:39.884 --> 01:27:43.221
And he said. "I want you kids
to know what I'm gonna do

1577
01:27:43.221 --> 01:27:47.809
because it's very risky and maybe you
won't have as much money in the future."

1578
01:27:48.768 --> 01:27:51.021
[Cheryl] Well. even though
they weren't living together.

1579
01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:55.275
my mom said. "Yes. do it.
You need to do it."

1580
01:27:56.609 --> 01:28:00.613
[Lisa] So he took all his money
and he bought back <i>Muppet Show</i>.

1581
01:28:00.613 --> 01:28:03.199
the Muppet movies and <i>The Dark Crystal</i>.

1582
01:28:03.867 --> 01:28:07.203
That was a real reach to do that.
and really. really brave.

1583
01:28:08.288 --> 01:28:10.707
[no audible dialogue]

1584
01:28:10.707 --> 01:28:14.210
My parents didn't talk
about their romance. so to speak.

1585
01:28:15.128 --> 01:28:17.547
but they'd been through so much.

1586
01:28:20.342 --> 01:28:23.011
[Brian] I'm sure they were both
the love of each other's lives

1587
01:28:23.511 --> 01:28:25.096
who couldn't live with each other.

1588
01:28:26.014 --> 01:28:27.015
[no audible dialogue]

1589
01:28:35.857 --> 01:28:37.942
- ...a great deal. Always tighter.
- [Seeff] Yeah.

1590
01:28:37.942 --> 01:28:38.860
[shutter clicks]

1591
01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:42.322
Uh. would-- would you say
that you have a philosophy of life?

1592
01:28:42.322 --> 01:28:44.240
If our message is anything. it is that--

1593
01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.618
is that it's a--
it's a positive approach to life...

1594
01:28:46.618 --> 01:28:48.912
- Uh-huh.
- ...and that life is basically good.

1595
01:28:48.912 --> 01:28:51.623
And by taking
a positive approach to it all.

1596
01:28:51.623 --> 01:28:54.376
it-- it makes it. uh--
makes life a lot easier.

1597
01:28:54.376 --> 01:28:57.462
Right. Now--
Now what about the conceptualizing?

1598
01:28:57.462 --> 01:28:58.797
I mean. writing the stories.

1599
01:28:58.797 --> 01:29:03.093
I mean. for instance. <i>Dark Crystal</i>
was a film that I absolutely loved.

1600
01:29:03.093 --> 01:29:06.054
- Oh. good. You're gonna love our new one.
- Yes. Oh. good.

1601
01:29:06.054 --> 01:29:09.224
Our new one is. uh. I think it's--
it's similar to <i>Dark Crystal</i>.

1602
01:29:09.224 --> 01:29:12.143
but I think it's. uh--
Well. I'm-- I'm very excited by it.

1603
01:29:12.143 --> 01:29:13.853
[Seeff] Is it more sophisticated or--

1604
01:29:13.853 --> 01:29:15.730
Yeah. It's a good deal more sophisticated.

1605
01:29:15.730 --> 01:29:18.608
Every time you do a film.
everything advances a little bit.

1606
01:29:18.608 --> 01:29:19.693
[shutter clicks]

1607
01:29:20.694 --> 01:29:22.445
[sighs] The Labyrinth.

1608
01:29:22.445 --> 01:29:25.949

1615
01:29:37.293 --> 01:29:39.671
[Connelly] When you think about it.
it's bananas. right?

1616
01:29:39.671 --> 01:29:44.009
{\an8}You're in this kids movie. and I have
David Bowie as the kind of. like...

1617
01:29:44.009 --> 01:29:46.302
I mean. it's a mad idea.

1618
01:29:46.302 --> 01:29:48.013
and it's kind of great.

1619
01:29:48.013 --> 01:29:49.848
It doesn't look that far.

1620
01:29:50.932 --> 01:29:54.644
It's further than you think.
Time is short.

1621
01:29:55.395 --> 01:29:58.231
[Lisa] It was a very ambitious film
being a musical.

1622
01:29:58.231 --> 01:30:00.900
working with David Bowie.
working with human actors.

1623
01:30:01.484 --> 01:30:02.902
For him. that was actually harder

1624
01:30:02.902 --> 01:30:05.947
because he hadn't been directing humans.
He'd been directing puppets.

1625
01:30:05.947 --> 01:30:09.075
[Jim] It comes down slowly
into your hand and the moment...

1626
01:30:09.075 --> 01:30:11.828
I was 14.
and there's this huge production.

1627
01:30:11.828 --> 01:30:14.664
You know. this world that he had created.

1628
01:30:14.664 --> 01:30:16.541
and I'm kind of at the middle of it.

1629
01:30:16.541 --> 01:30:17.459
[crew] Ta-da-da!

1630
01:30:17.459 --> 01:30:19.669
[Jim] When you're casting
a part like Sarah...

1631
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:21.171
[crew] And playback.

1632
01:30:21.963 --> 01:30:23.715
...which is the part in the film.

1633
01:30:23.715 --> 01:30:27.177
you hope someone walks in the door
and is the right person.

1634
01:30:27.177 --> 01:30:30.263
And when Jenny walked in.
she was the right person.

1635
01:30:33.808 --> 01:30:38.521
[Connelly] Despite having felt so nervous.
Jim is such a calming presence.

1636
01:30:39.439 --> 01:30:42.525
He would say. "Okay.
so now you're going to sit here.

1637
01:30:42.525 --> 01:30:44.527
and you're going to turn over
and then you're gonna talk

1638
01:30:44.527 --> 01:30:46.738
to this little worm
that's coming out of the wall."

1639
01:30:46.738 --> 01:30:50.116
I'm like. "Great. Okay. Is this right?"
[chuckles]

1640
01:30:50.116 --> 01:30:51.201
[chattering]

1641
01:30:51.201 --> 01:30:52.827
Say something. worm.

1642
01:30:54.079 --> 01:30:54.913
Uh-huh.

1643
01:30:54.913 --> 01:30:58.708
[Connelly] There was so much
imagination and creativity.

1644
01:30:59.709 --> 01:31:04.839
And it was so spectacular
to be around people

1645
01:31:04.839 --> 01:31:06.925
{\an8}who are creating in that way.

1646
01:31:06.925 --> 01:31:08.760
{\an8}It was like being in a dream world.

1647
01:31:09.344 --> 01:31:12.263
- [Jim] One. Drop.
- [Sarah] Help!

1648
01:31:13.348 --> 01:31:14.224
Help!

1649
01:31:14.224 --> 01:31:17.310
[Connelly] I love all the sporty.
stunty stuff.

1650
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:20.563
"Take me higher. Throw me down a chute.

1651
01:31:20.563 --> 01:31:22.774
Can I be on the wires a little longer?"

1652
01:31:22.774 --> 01:31:25.860
- I loved it.
- [bell rings]

1653
01:31:26.611 --> 01:31:28.947
The way that the puppeteers
would work together.

1654
01:31:28.947 --> 01:31:30.365
it was really incredible.

1655
01:31:31.491 --> 01:31:35.912
Ooh. yes. Hmm. Hmm. Yes. Which way? Hmm?

1656
01:31:36.496 --> 01:31:40.166
[Brian] My dad never urged
any of us kids into the industry.

1657
01:31:41.084 --> 01:31:43.128
He just sort of supported us.

1658
01:31:43.878 --> 01:31:46.548
[Lisa] My dad did notice. like.
what we were good at.

1659
01:31:47.132 --> 01:31:52.470
encouraging Heather's work
both as a show creator. a theater maker.

1660
01:31:54.139 --> 01:31:58.268
Cheryl was so talented
with textiles and fabrics.

1661
01:31:58.268 --> 01:32:01.104
but she was also really good on story.

1662
01:32:01.771 --> 01:32:05.191
[Cheryl] Lisa was always
gonna be a television executive.

1663
01:32:06.026 --> 01:32:10.280
My younger brother John.
he was doing. sort of. body performing.

1664
01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:14.200
and wound up doing Sweetums
and doing the Coca-Cola polar bear.

1665
01:32:14.993 --> 01:32:18.038
[Lisa] Brian. he had training
in everything technical.

1666
01:32:18.038 --> 01:32:23.043
On the directing side. he just knew that
Brian was a gearhead in a way. [chuckles]

1667
01:32:23.043 --> 01:32:24.419
[chattering]

1668
01:32:24.419 --> 01:32:25.754
[Brian] For <i>Labyrinth</i>.

1669
01:32:25.754 --> 01:32:29.674
my dad wanted to do a
fully radio-controlled character. Hoggle.

1670
01:32:30.717 --> 01:32:34.387
And he was saying. "Brian.
can you figure out how to do this?"

1671
01:32:36.264 --> 01:32:39.893
This was the beginning
of animatronics at the Creature Shop.

1672
01:32:39.893 --> 01:32:41.519
We both stayed open too long.

1673
01:32:41.519 --> 01:32:43.313
- [crew] Action! Shut up!
- [actor] Thank you.

1674
01:32:44.856 --> 01:32:48.735
- Oh! That makes it worse.
- Oh. come on. [grunts]

1675
01:32:48.735 --> 01:32:51.571
- [actor 2] That makes it...
- Ain't it? Yeah.

1676
01:32:51.571 --> 01:32:53.239
What a nice surprise.

1677
01:32:53.239 --> 01:32:54.699
Hello. Hedgewart.

1678
01:32:54.699 --> 01:32:56.993
- Hogwart.
- Hoggle.

1679
01:32:58.787 --> 01:33:03.416
[Brian] So. I got to really work with him
side by side and call him Jim. not Dad.

1680
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:10.131
And I got to feel how rewarding it was
to work alongside Jim Henson.

1681
01:33:11.132 --> 01:33:14.886
which was very different
than being his son and in his family.

1682
01:33:16.012 --> 01:33:18.682
He was a kid at work.
That was the biggest difference.

1683
01:33:19.808 --> 01:33:23.687
When he was home. he was always trying
to set a good adult example.

1684
01:33:23.687 --> 01:33:27.023
And when he was at work. he was free.

1685
01:33:27.732 --> 01:33:29.734
{\an8}[Brian] So how do you think
the film's going so far?

1686
01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:33.697
{\an8}I think this will probably be
the finest motion picture ever made.

1687
01:33:33.697 --> 01:33:36.616
{\an8}[Brian laughs] Good thing
I'm only showing this to my family.

1688
01:33:36.616 --> 01:33:38.785
- [laughs]
- What does that laugh mean?

1689
01:33:38.785 --> 01:33:42.497
[Brian] No. no. I-- I-- I'm glad
I'm not shooting for the evening news.

1690
01:33:42.497 --> 01:33:44.582
This is gonna be the best movie ever made.

1691
01:33:44.582 --> 01:33:46.876
[Brian] Okay. All right.
Well. I-- I'll agree with that.

1692
01:33:46.876 --> 01:33:49.462
Uh. I'm happy to hear that actually.
[laughs]

1693
01:33:50.547 --> 01:33:52.716
- You better agree with it.
- [laughs]

1694
01:34:01.433 --> 01:34:03.893
{\an8}[Lisa] <i>Labyrinth</i> was a colossal failure.

1695
01:34:04.602 --> 01:34:09.315
I do think <i>Labyrinth</i> was the one where
he thought they just-- they don't like it.

1696
01:34:09.983 --> 01:34:13.069
People don't like it.
and he really didn't expect that.

1697
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:18.116
[Oz] It's hard to put
one's heart and soul in something.

1698
01:34:18.742 --> 01:34:21.995
and then be rejected to a degree
and not carry it around with you.

1699
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:27.083
[Goelz] He was sad about the reception
that the film was getting.

1700
01:34:28.752 --> 01:34:29.794
This was unlike Jim.

1701
01:34:31.087 --> 01:34:33.340
We had lunch one day.

1702
01:34:34.257 --> 01:34:36.760
We were about to leave
and he said. "I love you."

1703
01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.178
And I said. "I love you too."

1704
01:34:39.137 --> 01:34:42.515
I mean. it was one of those moments
where I think he was just--

1705
01:34:42.515 --> 01:34:45.602
He was feeling vulnerable enough that
he would just say something like that.

1706
01:34:45.602 --> 01:34:48.396
[no audible dialogue]

1707
01:34:48.396 --> 01:34:50.732
[Oz] That's one thing about Jim.
when he did something.

1708
01:34:50.732 --> 01:34:53.401
he always had two other.
three other things he wanted to do.

1709
01:34:55.862 --> 01:34:59.407
As sad as he was about the movie.
he didn't dwell.

1710
01:34:59.407 --> 01:35:02.327
He kept on going
and did other things that excited him.

1711
01:35:04.496 --> 01:35:05.747
[screams]

1712
01:35:05.747 --> 01:35:07.832
[Goelz] One day.
Jim called a meeting and said.

1713
01:35:07.832 --> 01:35:09.918
"I'd like to do a show that stops war."

1714
01:35:10.835 --> 01:35:12.545
And that became <i>Fraggle Rock</i>.

1715
01:35:13.963 --> 01:35:15.757
[Lisa] <i>Storyteller's</i> is the gem.

1716
01:35:15.757 --> 01:35:17.425
He was so proud of it.

1717
01:35:17.425 --> 01:35:21.262
[Brian] It was a culmination
of everything he had been striving for.

1718
01:35:21.262 --> 01:35:23.598
[Cheryl] He always had
so many projects brewing.

1719
01:35:26.601 --> 01:35:30.146
{\an8}Good. Now I can make my entrance
like I do in every show.

1720
01:35:30.939 --> 01:35:34.359
[Rockwell] He was all about
the next technological advance.

1721
01:35:34.359 --> 01:35:35.985
{\an8}He was flirting with CGI

1722
01:35:35.985 --> 01:35:38.905
{\an8}with a character on the <i>Jim Henson Hour</i>
that was computer-generated.

1723
01:35:38.905 --> 01:35:40.573
Watch. watch this. Here we go.

1724
01:35:40.573 --> 01:35:41.908
[inhales sharply]

1725
01:35:41.908 --> 01:35:42.992
[sneezes]

1726
01:35:42.992 --> 01:35:45.537
[Jim] I'm very excited
by computer graphics.

1727
01:35:45.537 --> 01:35:48.707
and performing 'em. uh. as puppets.

1728
01:35:48.707 --> 01:35:51.334
It is mostly being done like animation.

1729
01:35:51.334 --> 01:35:54.421
And what we're trying to do with it
is perform it live like a puppet.

1730
01:35:54.421 --> 01:35:57.632
so you can capture real performance.
a dramatic performance.

1731
01:35:58.216 --> 01:36:00.593
[Oz] He always wanted to go back
and do exciting things.

1732
01:36:00.593 --> 01:36:05.974
And he was just worrying about overhead.
and essentially not having time to create.

1733
01:36:05.974 --> 01:36:07.642
[no audible dialogue]

1734
01:36:07.642 --> 01:36:13.023
It was not long after that that
he decided to sell the company to Disney.

1735
01:36:15.692 --> 01:36:19.279
He was a huge Disney World fan.
Like. fanatic.

1736
01:36:21.698 --> 01:36:22.949
[Oz] He wasn't just selling outright.

1737
01:36:22.949 --> 01:36:26.453
He wanted to get back to not worrying
about business as much and having fun.

1738
01:36:28.079 --> 01:36:30.290
<i>With us. from Walt Disney World
this morning in Florida.</i>

1739
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:33.001
are Michael Eisner and Jim Henson.
Good morning to both of you.

1740
01:36:33.001 --> 01:36:34.336
- Good morning. Charlie.
- Good morning.

1741
01:36:34.336 --> 01:36:37.255
They had a handshake agreement.
and it was really. you know. joyful.

1742
01:36:37.255 --> 01:36:38.673
I-- As far as I can tell.

1743
01:36:38.673 --> 01:36:41.259
this is-- this is a wonderful place
for my characters to be.

1744
01:36:42.177 --> 01:36:45.263
[Brian] It was really the beginning
of the next chapter of creativity

1745
01:36:45.263 --> 01:36:47.182
that he was excited about.

1746
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:53.438
[no audible dialogue]

1747
01:36:54.439 --> 01:36:57.442
Jim had so many new ideas
and so many things he wanted to do.

1748
01:36:59.361 --> 01:37:00.570
I remember he called.

1749
01:37:01.988 --> 01:37:04.324
He said. "Hey. Frank.
I want to talk to you about something."

1750
01:37:06.242 --> 01:37:07.952
And that's the last I ever talked to him.

1751
01:37:07.952 --> 01:37:09.454
[ticking]

1752
01:37:09.454 --> 01:37:10.538
[ticking stops]

1753
01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:18.672
[newscaster 1]
<i>A little of the magic is gone.</i>

1754
01:37:18.672 --> 01:37:21.174
<i>Jim Henson.
the man who created the Muppets.</i>

1755
01:37:21.174 --> 01:37:23.760
<i>has died at the age of only 53</i>

1756
01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:27.472
<i>from what is described
as a massive bacterial infection.</i>

1757
01:37:27.472 --> 01:37:30.642
<i>He had pneumonia.
which went untreated for three days.</i>

1758
01:37:31.434 --> 01:37:33.103
[newscaster 2]
<i>To call Jim Henson a puppeteer.</i>

1759
01:37:33.103 --> 01:37:35.522
<i>comes nowhere near
describing his accomplishment.</i>

1760
01:37:35.522 --> 01:37:39.859
<i>or the love. affection and knowledge
that his characters brought to the world.</i>

1761
01:37:41.319 --> 01:37:45.073
[newscaster 1] <i>For millions of people.
it will seem like a death in the family.</i>

1762
01:37:49.994 --> 01:37:53.164
[Lisa] I was in Los Angeles.
and I was too late.

1763
01:37:53.164 --> 01:37:54.833
And Brian was too late too.

1764
01:37:58.003 --> 01:38:02.007
But my mom went to the hospital
to be with him.

1765
01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:07.721
And what they discussed
is private to them.

1766
01:38:08.471 --> 01:38:12.976
And it's nice that they had
whatever closure they had right there.

1767
01:38:19.441 --> 01:38:21.609
This was just unthinkable to us

1768
01:38:21.609 --> 01:38:28.450
because this frail giant had just been
so unconquerable all these years.

1769
01:38:29.784 --> 01:38:32.954
It was just
one of the worst days of my life.

1770
01:38:34.372 --> 01:38:35.373
[sighs]

1771
01:38:38.793 --> 01:38:42.297
It was just this feeling that
the light had gone out.

1772
01:38:43.173 --> 01:38:45.425
and that it was not gonna come back on.

1773
01:38:47.469 --> 01:38:49.804
He was ripped away from us way too young.

1774
01:38:50.472 --> 01:38:53.141
It was an unfair early death.

1775
01:38:59.147 --> 01:39:02.192
[Rockwell] We all gathered in the New York
office. people from all around the world.

1776
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:07.113
Our focus was to put
this funeral together in five days.

1777
01:39:09.282 --> 01:39:13.203
Someone came over
'cause the kids had the instructions.

1778
01:39:13.203 --> 01:39:14.871
There was a set of directions in the will.

1779
01:39:19.084 --> 01:39:22.796
{\an8}It was like. "Oh. well. there are
instructions for-- for making this show."

1780
01:39:22.796 --> 01:39:24.422
So it was uncanny in a way.

There's so much loyalty to Jim
because he was loyal to us.

We all do whatever we can
because he gave us so much.

[Lisa] There are just endless things
that have been changed

1831
01:42:40.201 --> 01:42:43.371
by the way he saw the world.

1832
01:42:46.166 --> 01:42:52.172
The tenderness that
he clearly had for humanity.

1833
01:42:52.797 --> 01:42:59.721
and the space he gave to creativity
and expression of imagination.

1834
01:42:59.721 --> 01:43:01.848
I see that in everything that he did.

1835
01:43:04.309 --> 01:43:07.145
Well. I don't think there'll ever be
another Jim Henson.

my heart would say something
a tad quietly.

1838
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:29.459
but I wouldn't say it to him
because he-- he'd be embarrassed

Uh. so on the outside. I'd probably say.

"Jim. I'm busy. Could you please move?"
