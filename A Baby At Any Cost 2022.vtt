Did you see her toes?

Oh my gosh. I can't believe
how perfect she is. Brad.

00:03:21.452 --> 00:03:23.118
Now that she's here.

We're so grateful.

59
00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:36.715
I knew it the moment we met.
you'd be wonderful parents.

60
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.051
Just like the other family
I gave this gift to.

61
00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:42.429

so loving and kind.

I wanna bet I know.

00:03:51.607 --> 00:03:52.814
It's my sister again.

67
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.608
She's been blowing up
my phone.

68
00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:55.859
Yeah. she's been texting me
too.

69
00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.319

Is everything okay?

74
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.707
Yes. Six pounds.
seven ounces. 19 inches.

75
00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:21.551
Olivia is healthy and perfect.

76

[Brad] But. hey. Jen...

78
00:04:27.977 --> 00:04:30.719
It's been an emotional day.

79
00:04:30.813 --> 00:04:33.230
Let's keep it positive.
concentrate on the baby.

80
00:04:33.357 --> 00:04:34.398
Of course!

81
00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:37.526
I just think it should
have been me as the surrogate.

82
00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:38.777
We're family.

83
00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.991
I'm just so happy
you are happy.

84
00:04:44.076 --> 00:04:48.036
I've been stuck out there
waiting to meet you. Olivia!

85
00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:49.904
Oh. look at her.
Let me hold her.

86
00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:51.239
Yeah.

87
00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:52.874
[Jen] Why don't you answer
my calls?

88
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.242
We've been a little busy.

89
00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:55.544

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.045

00:04:58.507 --> 00:04:59.881
Look at her...

95

[Brad] Yeah. that's her.

96
00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:18.317
[Monica]
kind of want some time. but...

97
00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:21.486

thank you.

102
00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.412
Ruby and I made it.

103
00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:31.446
She wanted to be here today.

104
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.081
but I'll bring her by
later tonight.

105
00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:34.041
[Jen] Thank you.

106
00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:35.459
Can I hold her?
Can I hold her?

107
00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:37.118
Let's go inside first.

108
00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:37.961
[Monica] Yeah.

109
00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.297
I didn't know you
were coming by.

110
00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:41.631
I didn't...

111
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.592
Where else would I be. right?

112
00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.554
Come on. Olivia.

113
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.474
[Monica] Hi. baby.

114
00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:54.394
Ohhh.

115
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.303
Gentle.

116
00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:58.774
I know how to handle
a baby. Monica.

117
00:05:58.859 --> 00:05:59.816
I think she looks like me.

118
00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.402
[Brad] I'll make sure
the nursery's set.

119
00:06:03.072 --> 00:06:03.820
Thanks.

120
00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.614

[phone buzzes]

122
00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.652
It's Sam. I have to take it.

123
00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:12.654
-Hey.
-[Sam] What time
are you drooping off Ruby?

124
00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:15.207
-What do you mean?
-[Sam] It's my night
is what I mean.

125
00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.794
Ruby said she wants to
meet her cousin tonight.

126
00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:19.994
so. it doesn't matter
if it's your night.

127
00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:21.630
[Sam] She has homework.

128
00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.507
She has the right to
see her cousin. Sam.

129
00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:25.175
[Sam] That's fine.
I'll just pick her myself...

130
00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:26.009
No. you can't do that.

131
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.469
because she's my daughter.
too!

132
00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:28.553
Sam?

133
00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:33.266
He hung up on me?

134
00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.344
That is so not okay.

135
00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:38.146
-I'm calling him back.
-No. don't call him back.

136
00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:40.348
You're too upset.

137
00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:44.185
You can't let Sam
get to you like this.

138
00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.989
You know. Ruby misses me.
and she wants to meet Olivia.

139
00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:50.575
He's being so unreasonable
and by the book.

140
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:51.576
Oh. lawyers.

141
00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:53.027
Hey. Thanks.

142
00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:55.697
Oh. no. no. Not you.
You're amazing.

143
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:58.533
I wouldn't have the house
if it weren't for you.

144
00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:00.869
It's just Sam. you know. he--

145
00:07:00.963 --> 00:07:02.537
He calls me a bad mom.

146
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:03.547
because I'm not raising Ruby

147
00:07:03.674 --> 00:07:05.206
the way he thinks
she should be raised.

148
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.174
[Monica] You're a great mom.

149
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.969
I know!

150
00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:12.046
His ego's just bruised.
because you left him.

151
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:14.266
And remember.
you're being true to yourself.

152
00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.050
and you're not
letting him control you.

153
00:07:16.145 --> 00:07:18.562
But he's still controlling me.

154
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.772
And now my child is slowly
being taken from me.

155
00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:23.400
[Monica]
Babe. that's not gonna happen.

156
00:07:23.527 --> 00:07:26.278
Not if I can help it.

157
00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.989
You are so lucky you
have a nice daddy. Olivia.

158
00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:32.033
I wish Ruby did.

159
00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:35.570
Seriously. Mon.
you have it all.

160
00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:37.906
Beautiful home. an amazingly
supportive husband

161
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.708
with a successful business.

162
00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:43.587
Your law practice is on fire.
and now you have Olivia.

163
00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:48.216
Mom and Dad would
be so proud of you.

164
00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:50.260
They always were. though.

165
00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.095
And they were
proud of you too.

166
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.597
Yeah. right.

167
00:07:53.724 --> 00:07:55.089
They were!

168
00:07:55.184 --> 00:07:58.593
And hey. we're gonna win
Ruby's custody case.

169
00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.061
Thanks. Mon.

170
00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:01.646
You're always on my side.

171
00:08:01.732 --> 00:08:02.939
Oh. Open my present.

172
00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.984
What?
You did not have to do that.

173
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:08.653
[gasps] Jen!

174
00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:10.947
[Monica] I used to read that
to Ruby when she was little.

175
00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.775
I know. And Olivia's gonna
love it just the same.

176
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:15.076
Yeah.

177
00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:16.119
I'm all set
to jump in and nanny.

178
00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:17.278
you just say the word.

179
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.247
I already switched all my
yoga classes to nights.

180
00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:20.957
Thanks.

181
00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.042
The nursery is all set.

182
00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:24.169
Great.

183
00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:29.674
[Monica] Come on. Olivia.
let's go see your new room.

184
00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.554
You have it all. Monica.

185
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.181
[suspenseful music crescendo]

186
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.804
[Monica] Jen is
obsessed with Olivia.

187
00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:43.805
Ah. she misses Ruby.

188
00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:45.473
You know.
Sam's barely let her see her

189
00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.775
the last three weeks.

190
00:08:47.653 --> 00:08:48.735
I know.

191
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.028
At least she's been busy here.

192
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.614
Well. you've been
a great sister

193
00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:53.657
for putting up with her.

194
00:08:53.784 --> 00:08:56.484
She was there for me
a lot after the accident.

195
00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:58.787
She's the reason why
you got into the accident

196
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.822
in the first place. Mon.

197
00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:02.249
That's all behind us.

198
00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.584
[Monica] And we were young.

199
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.044
Jen has a really big heart.

200
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.296
She's just...

201
00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:11.833
out to [indistinct] sometimes.

202
00:09:11.927 --> 00:09:16.004
She's determined to know every
detail of Olivia's schedule.

203
00:09:16.098 --> 00:09:17.347
Oh. she can't wait for us
to get back to work.

204
00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.976
You know. I'm gonna have to.
uh. make sure Jen stays
focused

205
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.811
whenever she takes over.

206
00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.178
You know her.

207
00:09:24.273 --> 00:09:25.397
Unfortunately. uh.

208
00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:29.484
I have to go back to work
earlier than we planned.

209
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.443
Oh.

210
00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:32.821
It's okay.

211
00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.156
I have a doctor's appointment.

212
00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:37.242
and Olivia can
just come with me.

213
00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:40.695
Oh. and Jen will be here

214
00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.697
to help me tomorrow afternoon.

215
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.374
Oh. why don't you
stop by the office

216
00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:45.542
after your appointment?

217
00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:47.002
Jen can meet you there.

218
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:47.877
Are you sure?

219
00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:54.217
It's only been two weeks.
right?

220
00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:57.304
And I'm going to miss
our little Olivia

221
00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.639
on my first day back to work.

222
00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:00.974
It'd be nice
to see her...

223
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.225
and you.

224
00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:07.981
Hey. babe. what's wrong?

225
00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:10.734
It's nothing. I'm sorry. hey.

226
00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.561
It's just--

227
00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.063
I mean.
I know I should be grateful

228
00:10:15.157 --> 00:10:17.782
that we have Olivia.
and I am. but...

229
00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:22.203
part of me
is like heartbroken

230
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:24.906
for the things
I couldn't do for her.

231
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.790
Like what?

232
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.712
I couldn't carry her
inside of me.

233
00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:32.246
I couldn't deliver her.

234
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:34.582
I can't even
breastfeed her. Brad. I...

235
00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:37.218
Babe. Olivia doesn't care
about any of that.

236
00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:39.554
She just wants you
to love her.

237
00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:41.640
You're gonna...

238
00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:47.228
make the best mom ever.

239
00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:51.265
You have more love to give
than anyone I've ever met.

240
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.735
And Olivia and I are
lucky to have you.

241
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.612
[emotional music playing]

242
00:10:57.199 --> 00:10:58.448
Thank you.

243
00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:06.790
[instrumental music playing]

244
00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:19.803
[Lily] It's been a few weeks
since I've been in the office.

245
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.296
-I have cookies.
-[Brad] Lily?

246
00:11:22.391 --> 00:11:25.967
Lily. oh. you are so sweet.

247
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:27.301
Oatmeal raisin for you

248
00:11:27.396 --> 00:11:29.470
and chocolate chip
for you know who.

249
00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:32.399
You know me too well.
and we have missed you.

250
00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:34.526
[Monica]
Yes. It's been two weeks.

251
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.144
You look amazing.

252
00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:37.487
Thanks.

253
00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:38.863
This is for Olivia.

254
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:41.149
Thank you.

255
00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:43.576
My mom read it to me
when I was a baby.

256
00:11:43.662 --> 00:11:45.653
and apparently I loved it.

257
00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:46.996
[Lily] Oh my gosh!

258
00:11:47.124 --> 00:11:49.582
She's so much bigger.

259
00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.752
How is the little princess?

260
00:11:52.838 --> 00:11:55.255
Well. the little princess
was up all night.

261
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.999
but I made some coffee.
Do you want some?

262
00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:00.009
I would love some.
but let me get it.

263
00:12:00.137 --> 00:12:02.971
You're a sleep-deprived mom
now.

264
00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.640
[Lily] Besides.
I know where everything is
in this office.

265
00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:06.841
It hasn't been that long

266
00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.852
since I worked here.

267
00:12:08.979 --> 00:12:11.271
You know. I was so happy
to hear from you. Brad.

268
00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.398
And you said that you have
a surprise for me?

269
00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:14.983
Oh. I do.

270
00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:16.067
Check it out.

271
00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:17.485
Okay.

272
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.950
[instrumental music playing]

273
00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.827
You are officially the star

274
00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.954
of the new app
we're developing.

275
00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.956
[Brad]
Baby Steps. What do you think?

276
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.532
-Wow.
-[Brad] Seeing Olivia grow

277
00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:33.460
inside of you.
really inspired me.

278
00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:36.546
and our focus groups
are absolutely loving it.

279
00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.507
It's a bit overwhelming.
I mean. I...

280
00:12:39.593 --> 00:12:41.801
I just. I--
I never could have imagined

281
00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:45.096
an app about my pregnancy
would come from a temp job.

282
00:12:45.182 --> 00:12:48.183
Well. we never imagined
a temp would volunteer

283
00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.310
to be our surrogate. so...

284
00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.395
When Brad told me
what you guys
were going through.

285
00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.055
I knew I could help.

286
00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:55.899
The first time I did it.
it made me so happy.

287
00:12:56.777 --> 00:12:57.901
so...

288
00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.236
why not do it again?

289
00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:03.072
We are so blessed to
have met you. Lily.

290
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.733
Look at you two with her.

291
00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.702
You know. if you make
an app about parenting.

292
00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:09.412
-you two should be the stars.
-[Brad scoffs]

293
00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:11.239
Actually. I'll get a picture.

294
00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:13.241
[Monica] We'd love a picture.
Thank you.

295
00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.418
[Lily] No problem. Happy to.

296
00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.087
Smile.

297
00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:22.583
Oh. it's so cute.

298
00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:23.593
[laughs]

299
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.420
Oh. hey. Lily.
if you're free tomorrow.

300
00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:27.305
do you wanna go

301
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.766
on a picnic
with Olivia and me?

302
00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:31.184
[Lily] I would love that.

303
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.311
So. meet at my house at 10?

304
00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:34.562
That sounds perfect.

305
00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:35.930
That does sound perfect.

306
00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.431
Oh. great. Jen. You're here.

307
00:13:37.526 --> 00:13:38.933
Hi. Jen.

308
00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.268
I brought the bottle warmer.

309
00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.270
[Jen] I got your text
to bring it over.

310
00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.364
Thank you. Um. could you.
uh. take a picture

311
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.616

312
00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:48.743
Yeah. that would be--
That would be great.

313
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:49.953
Here's my phone.

[ominous music playing]

Hey. Jen. did you
bring the formula?

316
00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.334
Oh. no. I forgot.

317
00:13:58.088 --> 00:13:59.287
It's okay.

318
00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:00.454
And I should take Olivia home.

319

get some work done. so...

320
00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:06.511

So do my investors.

-We don't have
any formula. so...
-Okay.

339
00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:50.338
[Jen] Am I ever getting
a photo of all of us together?

340
00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:53.266
You know. as a family.

341

For the picnic.

Wow. It's beautiful.
I've never been here before.

when we were little.

357

Jen. do you have it?

358
00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:36.643
I-- I can't find it.

359

I asked you specifically
to bring it.

360
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:40.772
Give me a sec.

361
00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:41.940
I know it's in here.

362
00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:48.562
I know a technique
that might help.

363
00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:49.864
Do you mind if I try?

364
00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:52.733
-Of course.
-Yeah?

365
00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:55.903
So. you just move your hand

366
00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:58.739
clockwise like that

367
00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.833
and it helps move
the gas and relieve the pain.

368
00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.670
Wow. Is it working. Olivia?

369
00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:07.548
How did you know that?

370
00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.050
[Lily] I read
a lot of baby books

371
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.259
during both pregnancies.

372
00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:13.421
just to make sure I was
doing everything right. so...

373
00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:15.181
An overachieving surrogate.

374
00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:17.591
[Monica] Mm-hmm.
Yeah. I'm not surprised.

375
00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:19.260
I knew you would be.

376
00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.929
She's happy now.
Say thank you. Lily.

377
00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:23.648
Of course.

378
00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.942
That's my girl. Yeah.

379
00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.103
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

380
00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:30.822
-That was really fun.
-[phone chimes]

381
00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.991
-You kidding? Thank you so
much for coming.
-Of course.

382
00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:35.276
Ooh. Brad said they're
launching the app next week.

383
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.995
Wow! That's soon.
[Monica] I know.

384
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.080
[Lily] I still can't
get over that poster.

385
00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:40.832
[ominous music playing]

386
00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.616
[niggling]

387
00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:44.043
It's Ruby.

388
00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.253
She misses me.
She says that Sam's being

389
00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:46.462
way too strict.

390
00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.510
[ominous music continues]

391
00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:00.727
[brakes screeching]

392
00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:01.936
Sorry.

393
00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.859
-Is she alright?
-You okay?

394
00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:10.445
Is she alright?

395
00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.157
Are you okay?

396
00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.076
The parking brake wasn't on.

397
00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:19.320
You just need to flip this
paddle with your foot
like this--

398
00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:20.997
I know how to use it.

399
00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:22.248
Really. you don't. Jen.

400
00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.791
She could have been hit.

401
00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:26.994
I thought that I did.

402
00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:28.829
I mean. I know that I. I did.

403
00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:30.339
Let's just go home.

404
00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.510
-Here. I can help if you--
-I got it.

405
00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:42.018
[Monica] Oh.
she could've been hit. Brad.

406
00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.936
I can't believe it.

407
00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:45.179
What did Jen say?

408
00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.847
That she thought
she set the brake.

409
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.191
and then she was sure she did.

410
00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:53.279
I'm wondering if it's a good
idea for her to be our nanny?

411
00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:55.490
I don't think it is.

412
00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:58.076
She forgot the formula.

413
00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:01.829
She forgot
Olivia's stomach medicine.

414
00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:04.749
Now this.

415
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:07.668
I love my sister.

416
00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.923
I don't know what's going
on with her right now.

417
00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:16.260
Maybe it's
the custody battle with Sam.

418
00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.546
-[Monica] We need
to put Olivia first.
-Yeah.

419
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.139
[Monica] I can take Olivia
to the office with me

420
00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:22.850
until we get things
figured out.

421
00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:27.522
You know what?
We can have mommy and me time.

422
00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.787
[ominous music playing]

423
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:05.560
[phone buzzing]

424
00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.773
Jennifer.
What can I do for you?

425
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.359
I was wondering if I could
take Ruby to lunch
this Saturday?

426
00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:15.236
I don't think
that's a good idea.

427
00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.571
[Jen] Why not?

428
00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:19.115
Well. for starters.
it's my day.

429
00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:20.441
and I want her with me.

430
00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:22.610
Plus. you're not
a good influence
on her right now.

431
00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:23.911
Why would you think that?
I'm her mother.

432
00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:24.871
She told me

433
00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.497
you let her
create a YouChat account.

434
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.282
But she was feeling
so left out. Sam.

435
00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:29.876
Okay. well. you need to check
with me first.

436
00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:30.751
I'll talk to her.

437
00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:31.919
I already
took it off her phone.

438
00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:33.787
Why would you do
something like that. Sam?

439
00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:35.923
You know. you don't even
know what she wants!

440
00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:38.009
What she wants is not as
important as what she needs.

441
00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:40.344
As a mother. you don't
seem to understand that.

442
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.305
You're not here
to be Ruby's best friend.

443
00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:43.389
You're here
to be her role model.

444
00:19:43.474 --> 00:19:45.766
to make sure she's safe
and focused.

445
00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:46.684
but you can't seem
to get that.

446
00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:49.145
Even your sister knows
you can't.

447
00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:50.688
What did my sister say?

448
00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:52.231
You have problems. Jennifer.

449
00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:53.816
but you're not
my problem anymore.

450
00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:56.444
[sighs]

451
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.326
[ominous music

452
00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.374
[music crescendo]

453
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.508
[Brad]
Okay. here we go. Thanks guys.

454
00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:23.170
-And we'll talk later.
-[man] Yes.

455
00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.680
All right. Be safe.

456
00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:27.516
Hey. you.

457
00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:28.851
Hey.

458
00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:29.977
There's our star.

459
00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:31.229
What are you doing here?

460
00:20:31.314 --> 00:20:34.357
Oh. I had to sign
a release form
for your baby app.

461
00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:37.518
I'm also looking for temp jobs
if anything opens up.

462
00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.153
Thought you wanted
something more permanent.

463
00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:40.854
Ideally.
Um. but until I find it.

464
00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:42.189
temping's gonna have to do.

465
00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.692
[chuckles]

466
00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:47.861
Um. by the way. if you ever
want someone to watch Olivia.

467
00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.029
so you guys can go
on a date night.

468
00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:50.331
just let me know.

469
00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:53.209
-Really?
-Yeah.

470
00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:54.868
Actually. can you wait here
for a minute?

471
00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:57.713
[Olivia crying]

472
00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:01.300
[phone buzzing]

473
00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:03.552
Hey. babe.

474
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.930
Hey. how's it going?

475
00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:08.891
Between feeding her.
changing her and rocking her?

476
00:21:09.018 --> 00:21:10.884
This briefing
is gonna take me forever.

477
00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:12.395
Yeah. I'm leaving soon
and I can swing by

478
00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:14.814
and take her home.
so you can get some work done.

479
00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.607
-Thank you.
-Hey. listen...

480
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:20.894
I have an idea.

481
00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:22.563
I'm intrigued.

482
00:21:22.657 --> 00:21:23.731
I'm thinking Lily
should be

483
00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:25.399
our nanny.

484
00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:26.567
Wait. Well. what about Jen?

485
00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:27.785
What about Jen?

486
00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:32.039
You know what? You're right.

487
00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.625
but would Lily
even be up for it?

488
00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:36.210
Well. she's here now.

489
00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:38.713
She told me
that she's looking for a job.

490
00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:41.716
She actually even
volunteered to babysit.

491
00:21:42.885 --> 00:21:43.718
Think about it. Mon.

492
00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.012
we could go out
once in a while.

493
00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:47.596
That'd be nice.

494
00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:49.256
I'll see if she can follow me
to the office

495
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.266
when I pick up Olivia.

496
00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:51.600
and we can talk about it.

497
00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:53.102
Jen's coming over
in about an hour

498
00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:54.928
to go over her paperwork. Um.

499
00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:57.231
can you be here fast?

500
00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:59.433
I'll be right over.
I love you.

501
00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.110
[Brad] Hey.

502
00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:02.278
Are you busy right now?

503
00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:03.571
Uh. no. Why?

504
00:22:07.076 --> 00:22:08.743
-Knock knock.
-[Olivia cries]

505
00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.277
Hey.

506
00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:12.038
-Aah!
-Go and see dad.

507
00:22:12.123 --> 00:22:15.082
You're giving Mommy
a hard time?

508
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.627
Hi. Hi. beautiful.

509
00:22:18.755 --> 00:22:19.953
Hi. Lily. How are you?

510
00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:21.213
Good. Good.

511
00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:22.340
Okay. So. Lily.

512
00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:25.459
um. we could really
use some help with Olivia.

513
00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:28.387
and Brad mentioned
you were looking for work.

514
00:22:28.473 --> 00:22:31.057
Would you be interested
in a nanny position?

515
00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:34.393
Really?

516
00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:36.771
Only if you're comfortable.

517
00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:38.972
Yeah. I-- I would love to.

518
00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:41.692
Thank you. Thank you so much.

519
00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:43.644
Thank you.

520
00:22:43.738 --> 00:22:44.737
[both laugh]

521
00:22:44.822 --> 00:22:45.988
For what?

522
00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:47.782
Oh. nothing.

523
00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:49.450
Actually. you're early.

524
00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:52.078
[Brad]
Maybe we should get going.

525
00:22:52.163 --> 00:22:54.205
[Lily] Uh. yeah.
Um. let. let me help you.

526
00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:57.875
-Oh. I'll call you tomorrow.
Lily.
-[Lily] great.

527
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.668
[Lily] That's great.

528
00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:06.967
Okay. so we have
a lot to go over.

529
00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:08.335
Sam's amended the custody.

530
00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:09.387
What just happened?

531
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:11.347
[Jen] With Lily?

532
00:23:11.474 --> 00:23:12.723
I know something did.

533
00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:14.850
What-- We'll talk about it
tomorrow.

534
00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:16.185
'cause we have a lot
to go over here.

535
00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:17.436
No.

536
00:23:17.522 --> 00:23:18.437
Now. Mon.

537
00:23:20.983 --> 00:23:23.275
We've decided to have
Lily help us with Olivia.

538
00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:27.780
Instead of me.
because of the other day?

539
00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:31.909
You have. uh.
your yoga studio.

540
00:23:31.994 --> 00:23:32.993
and Ruby.

541
00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:34.829
This is just--
It's gonna be better this way.

542
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:35.788
For who?

543
00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:39.834
Yeah.

544
00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.627
No. you're-- You're--
You're right.

545
00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:44.797
Let's um. let's deal
with Ruby right now.

546
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.343
Uh. so Sam filed
a custody amendment.

547
00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:51.378
Sorry. um. just so I know.

548
00:23:51.472 --> 00:23:55.048
when is. um. Lily gonna start?

549
00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:58.102
I really need you right now
to focus on this. okay?

550
00:23:58.187 --> 00:23:59.887
Yeah. okay.

551
00:23:59.981 --> 00:24:01.054
[Monica] Okay. so...

552
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:02.890
Sam's filing for full custody.

553
00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:04.483
He agreed to 50/50.

554
00:24:04.569 --> 00:24:06.694
[Monica] Originally. he did.

555
00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:09.071
I don't know
what happened. but...

556
00:24:09.198 --> 00:24:10.322
he's changed his mind.

557
00:24:10.408 --> 00:24:13.901
He always changes his mind
and he always gets his way.

558
00:24:13.995 --> 00:24:16.954
You and Sam have it all
and I'm left with nothing.

559
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:18.906
Jen...

560
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.001
No. I see what you're doing.

561
00:24:23.004 --> 00:24:24.670
I see what's going on.

562
00:24:24.755 --> 00:24:26.255
You are both punishing me.

563
00:24:26.382 --> 00:24:27.506
He's taking my baby

564
00:24:27.592 --> 00:24:31.084
and you have hired someone
else to take care of my niece.

565
00:24:31.179 --> 00:24:35.088
[Jen] Sam told me
you don't think
I'm a good mom.

566
00:24:35.183 --> 00:24:36.557
I never said that.

567
00:24:36.642 --> 00:24:38.767
Then why would you do
this to me?

568
00:24:38.895 --> 00:24:42.146
Why would--
would you hire a-- a stranger

569
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:44.190
over your own sister?

570
00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:45.900
I have tried my entire life

571
00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:47.693
to be like you. Monica.

572
00:24:47.778 --> 00:24:50.103
to be good and responsible.

573
00:24:50.198 --> 00:24:53.106
And now I'm being kicked out
of my own family?

574
00:24:53.201 --> 00:24:55.075
You're still her aunt.

575
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:57.203
[Monica] You can come visit
her anytime you want to.

576
00:24:57.288 --> 00:24:58.829
And as for Ruby.

577
00:24:58.915 --> 00:25:00.998
just because
he's filing for full custody.

578
00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:02.666
that does not mean
he's gonna get it.

579
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.503
I see what you're doing.

580
00:25:07.048 --> 00:25:10.299
You're still punishing me
for the accident.

581
00:25:10.426 --> 00:25:13.293
Isn't ten years enough?

582
00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:15.596
It has nothing
to do with that.

583
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:16.722
You were taking her
away from me.

584
00:25:16.807 --> 00:25:17.598
just like he is.

585
00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:19.132
Jen!

586
00:25:19.227 --> 00:25:20.601
Oh. sorry.

587
00:25:22.438 --> 00:25:23.312
I'm so sorry.

588
00:25:23.439 --> 00:25:25.314
No. I-- I'm. I'm sorry.

589
00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:26.640
I-- I forgot my purse.

590
00:25:26.734 --> 00:25:27.641
[Monica] Are you okay?

591
00:25:27.735 --> 00:25:28.984
Oh yeah. It's nothing. Um...

592
00:25:30.905 --> 00:25:33.030
Is Jen okay?

593
00:25:33.115 --> 00:25:34.949
I'm so sorry.
My sister's going
through a lot right now.

594
00:25:35.034 --> 00:25:36.158
and um. sometimes

595
00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:38.318
she has a short fuse.

596
00:25:38.412 --> 00:25:40.079
She'll be okay.
She'll be fine.

597
00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:41.655
I'm sure of it.

598
00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:43.749
Yeah. Yeah. of course.

599
00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:44.792
Okay.

600
00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:51.966
[ominous music playing]

601
00:25:55.846 --> 00:25:57.930
[music continues playing]

602
00:26:13.281 --> 00:26:15.364
[car alarm beeps]

603
00:26:18.869 --> 00:26:21.620
[music continues playing]

604

[ominous music

606
00:26:37.847 --> 00:26:39.680
[music intensifies]

607
00:26:50.151 --> 00:26:52.818
[line ringing]

608
00:26:54.989 --> 00:26:57.489
[operator]
911 what's the nature
of your emergency?

609
00:26:59.994 --> 00:27:01.902
[Brad] It's probably
just some high school kids.

610
00:27:01.996 --> 00:27:03.454
-like the police said.
-Uh-uh.

611
00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:05.581
So. it was just my car window
that was smashed.

612
00:27:05.708 --> 00:27:07.291
It was the only one.

613
00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:10.753
Then who?
Some old client with a grudge?

614
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.171
[Monica] Actually...

615
00:27:12.256 --> 00:27:13.714
Jen left the office
really upset today.

616
00:27:15.384 --> 00:27:16.717
I've never seen her that mad.

617
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.886
You think Jen did this?

618
00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:21.388
[phone buzzing]

619
00:27:23.893 --> 00:27:25.059
[line rings]

620
00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:26.518
-[Monica] Hey.
-Hey.

621
00:27:28.022 --> 00:27:29.772
I'm sorry about
what happened today.

622
00:27:31.192 --> 00:27:32.691
I lost my temper.

623
00:27:32.777 --> 00:27:33.901
How are you now?

624
00:27:33.986 --> 00:27:35.944
Still upset.

625
00:27:36.072 --> 00:27:37.938
You chose
some random girl over me.

626
00:27:38.032 --> 00:27:39.031
It hurts.

627
00:27:39.116 --> 00:27:42.284
Well. he's not random. Jen.
but I can understand

628
00:27:42.411 --> 00:27:45.287
how you would feel that way
with everything
going on with Ruby. so...

629
00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:48.957
[Monica] Hey. listen...

630
00:27:49.085 --> 00:27:50.834
you were pretty upset

631
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.169
when you left today.

632
00:27:53.047 --> 00:27:54.213
You didn't like...

633
00:27:54.298 --> 00:27:56.715
do anything
like crazy. did you?

634
00:27:56.801 --> 00:27:58.625
What are you talking about?

635
00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:00.094
Well. whenever I left work.

636
00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:02.796
my car window
was smashed. Jen.

637
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.798
I had to call the police.
file a report--

638
00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:06.967
And you're thinking I did it?

639
00:28:07.061 --> 00:28:07.968
Are you kidding me?

640
00:28:08.062 --> 00:28:09.803
No. I just--

641
00:28:09.897 --> 00:28:12.973
Monica. I can't even believe
you would consider it.

642
00:28:13.067 --> 00:28:14.141
Give me some credit.

643
00:28:14.235 --> 00:28:15.901
I. I just needed to be sure.

644
00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:16.944
It's insulting.

645
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:18.445
You're right...

646
00:28:18.531 --> 00:28:19.613
You're right.

647
00:28:19.699 --> 00:28:21.031
Can we talk about this
tomorrow?

648
00:28:21.117 --> 00:28:23.742
No. I'm not gonna talk
about this again.

649
00:28:23.828 --> 00:28:25.411
Ever.

650
00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:27.246
[suspenseful music playing]

651
00:28:48.686 --> 00:28:50.686
[suspenseful music continues]

652
00:28:58.821 --> 00:29:02.322
"You're playing fire.
Stay away
from Monica and Brad."

653
00:29:03.784 --> 00:29:04.992
[music crescendo]

654
00:29:16.297 --> 00:29:17.337
[music crescendo]

655
00:29:19.884 --> 00:29:21.592
[suspenseful music playing]

656
00:29:30.853 --> 00:29:33.053
Oh. good. Ruby was looking
everywhere for that.

657
00:29:33.147 --> 00:29:35.189
I'd like to give
it to Ruby myself.

658
00:29:35.274 --> 00:29:37.691
Well. she's busy.
So... thanks.

659
00:29:37.777 --> 00:29:39.818
-[Ruby] Mom!
-Oh. yay!

660
00:29:39.904 --> 00:29:41.612
Your mom's here.

661
00:29:41.697 --> 00:29:43.897
Hi. sweetie. How are you?
I've missed you.

662
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:45.783
I missed you too.

663
00:29:45.868 --> 00:29:47.451
Baby girl.

664
00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:48.577
Now that you got
your notebook.

665
00:29:48.704 --> 00:29:51.330
I need you to go start
your homework. alright?

666
00:29:51.415 --> 00:29:53.240
She just got here.

667
00:29:53.334 --> 00:29:55.959
I know. Rubes.
but I need to talk to her.

668
00:29:56.045 --> 00:29:57.577
and you still need
to do your homework.

669
00:29:57.671 --> 00:29:59.171
Listen to your dad. honey.
It's okay.

670
00:29:59.256 --> 00:30:00.589
I'll see you soon.

671
00:30:02.843 --> 00:30:03.717
[mouthing]

672
00:30:05.679 --> 00:30:07.387
Oh. um...

673
00:30:07.473 --> 00:30:08.922
can we do my nails today?

674
00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:10.423
[Laura] Of course. sweetie.

675
00:30:10.518 --> 00:30:12.684
Go start your homework.
I'll be there soon.

676
00:30:15.022 --> 00:30:16.271
Why are you doing this. Sam?

677
00:30:16.398 --> 00:30:17.564
She clearly misses me.

678
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.599
You cannot file
for full custody.

679
00:30:19.693 --> 00:30:21.101
Ruby's starting
to forget things.

680
00:30:21.195 --> 00:30:22.194
She's distracted.

681
00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:24.104
She's losing her temper.

682
00:30:24.198 --> 00:30:25.939
She's starting to act
a lot like you.

683
00:30:26.033 --> 00:30:27.941
She's nine.
and misses her mom.

684
00:30:28.035 --> 00:30:31.245
She seems very
preoccupied. Jennifer.

685
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.114
Her parents are getting
a divorce. Laura.

686
00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:35.282
and her father
has a new girlfriend.

687
00:30:35.376 --> 00:30:36.124
It's a lot.

688
00:30:36.252 --> 00:30:38.335
Don't take your anger
out on me.

689
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.420
I'm the one doing
everything for Ruby.

690
00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:41.621
You should be thanking me.

691
00:30:41.715 --> 00:30:42.881
-Thanking you?
-[Sam] Okay.

692
00:30:42.967 --> 00:30:45.384
Be reasonable. Jennifer.

693
00:30:45.469 --> 00:30:48.595
You're just not suited to care
for Ruby like we are.

694
00:30:48.681 --> 00:30:50.264
You're a bad influence.

695
00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:51.682
I'm her mother.

696
00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:53.392
Well. I'm kind of
like her mom too now.

697
00:30:53.477 --> 00:30:55.394
-Jennifer. enough!
-You are not her mother!

698
00:30:55.479 --> 00:30:56.803
What are you gonna do? Hit me.

699
00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:58.021
Jennifer!

700
00:30:58.107 --> 00:31:00.307
We will definitely
get Ruby that way.

701
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:02.609
You'll never get her.
and you will never be
her mother.

702
00:31:02.695 --> 00:31:05.070
You need to leave. Jennifer.
Now!

703
00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:06.738
[Sam] Get off of my property.

704
00:31:08.409 --> 00:31:09.616
I'll see you in court.

705
00:31:12.246 --> 00:31:13.996
[clanging]

706
00:31:15.249 --> 00:31:17.040
You're gonna have to pay
for that!

707
00:31:19.962 --> 00:31:21.336
[sobbing]

708
00:31:23.757 --> 00:31:25.299
[suspenseful music playing]

709
00:31:37.479 --> 00:31:38.520
[laughing]

710
00:31:41.692 --> 00:31:45.110
[music crescendo]

711
00:31:45.195 --> 00:31:46.653
[Jen] They were monsters.

712
00:31:46.739 --> 00:31:48.688
You know. she was vicious.

713
00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:52.525
Hey. think big picture
and control your impulses.

714
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.694
You know Sam's documenting
all this for the judge.

715
00:31:54.788 --> 00:31:56.863
I don't even know
if I can anymore.

716
00:31:56.957 --> 00:31:58.916
He's such a jerk.

717
00:31:59.001 --> 00:31:59.958
Then do it for Ruby.

718
00:32:01.503 --> 00:32:03.086
Oh. I have to show you
what I bought her?

719
00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:07.374
Mother-daughter bracelets.
Aren't they cute?

720
00:32:07.468 --> 00:32:09.009
-She's gonna love those.
-[Jen] I think so too.

721
00:32:09.094 --> 00:32:10.469
Yeah.

722
00:32:10.554 --> 00:32:12.512
[Jen] I saw Lily's car
out front.

723
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:14.881
How's that going?

724
00:32:14.975 --> 00:32:16.716
Uh. it's good.

725
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.019
It's just her first day.
but good.

726
00:32:21.482 --> 00:32:23.273
You wanna...

727
00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:25.150
You wanna make
Olivia's bottle?

728
00:32:25.235 --> 00:32:26.485
Sure.

729
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:27.402
Hey.

730
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:29.655
Oh. Jen.
I didn't know you were here.

731
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.781
Hi. Lily.

732
00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:34.401
[Monica] Could you pass me
a burp cloth. please?

733
00:32:34.495 --> 00:32:35.786
Oh. sure.

734
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:40.666
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

735
00:32:40.751 --> 00:32:43.085
Oh. the book I gave you.

736
00:32:43.212 --> 00:32:45.170
That's actually the book
that Lily got Olivia.

737
00:32:46.966 --> 00:32:48.382
Oh.

738
00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:50.008
Great minds think alike.

739
00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:53.887
I guess so.

740
00:32:53.973 --> 00:32:55.722
Hey. Jen. Olivia's bottle.

741
00:32:55.808 --> 00:32:57.599
Uh. yeah. sure.

742
00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:04.022
[Lily]
Uh. and I'm gonna go finish
the laundry.

743
00:33:04.984 --> 00:33:06.650
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

744
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.746
[Monica] Hey. Jen.

745
00:33:19.832 --> 00:33:21.781
So sorry about the book.

746
00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:22.949
Please don't be mad.

747
00:33:23.043 --> 00:33:24.501
No. I'm fine.

748
00:33:24.586 --> 00:33:26.003
I don't really care.

749
00:33:27.923 --> 00:33:29.506
-You wanna feed her?
-Yeah.

750
00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:32.125
Okay.

751
00:33:32.219 --> 00:33:34.886
There's your Aunt Jen. Yes!

752
00:33:34.972 --> 00:33:36.972
-Sleepy baby.
-She's so precious.

753
00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:40.809
Thank you.

754
00:33:40.936 --> 00:33:42.969
Were you able to get
a birthday present for Brad?

755
00:33:43.063 --> 00:33:45.480
Oh. yeah. Well. Lily saw him
looking at this watch online.

756
00:33:45.607 --> 00:33:48.066
so. I got it.

757
00:33:48.819 --> 00:33:49.860
Okay.

758
00:33:49.945 --> 00:33:50.861
Hey. what's this?

759
00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:54.906
This doesn't look
like Olivia's brand.

760
00:33:54.992 --> 00:33:56.483
It's amazing.

761
00:33:56.577 --> 00:33:58.318
It's what I gave Ruby
when she was a baby.

762
00:33:58.412 --> 00:34:01.246
It's rich in proteins
and vitamins. It's organic.

763
00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:03.248
Jen. you can't do that.

764
00:34:04.668 --> 00:34:05.658
Give her to me.

765
00:34:05.753 --> 00:34:07.327
No. What did I do?

766
00:34:07.421 --> 00:34:10.839
You can't-- You can't switch
a baby's formula.

767
00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:12.674
It'll upset her stomach.

768
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:14.426
But it'll be easier
on her stomach.

769
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:16.053
You didn't even ask me. Jen.

770
00:34:16.138 --> 00:34:17.929
Look. I-- I know
what I'm doing.

771
00:34:18.015 --> 00:34:21.224
See. this is why
you wouldn't work
as her nanny.

772
00:34:29.943 --> 00:34:32.519
Mon. look. I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help.

773
00:34:32.613 --> 00:34:34.521
Well. I have Lily
for that. so...

774
00:34:34.615 --> 00:34:37.574
It'd just be so much easier
if I took care of Olivia.

775
00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:40.619
I promise I'll do everything
the way that you want.

776
00:34:40.704 --> 00:34:43.196
Sorry. Jen. I--
This is what's best for now.

777
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.956
But I'm her aunt.
My love for her is different.

778
00:34:45.042 --> 00:34:45.999
Blood is blood.

779
00:34:46.085 --> 00:34:48.201
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

780
00:34:48.295 --> 00:34:49.369
-Okay.
-But I just wanna--

781
00:34:49.463 --> 00:34:52.798
Shh! She's-- She's sleeping.

782
00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.636
You know. it's like
you love Lily more
than you love me.

783
00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:01.932
That's not true.

784
00:35:04.478 --> 00:35:06.520

"To Olivia!
With all my love! Lily"

787
00:35:40.013 --> 00:35:41.588
All right. laundry's done.

788
00:35:41.682 --> 00:35:44.090
Um. I can organise
Olivia's toys if you want.

789
00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:45.934
Uh. she's-- she's sleeping.

790
00:35:49.022 --> 00:35:51.690
Uh. was that in--
in the garbage?

791
00:35:51.775 --> 00:35:53.233
I'm-- I'm so sorry. Lily.

792
00:35:53.318 --> 00:35:55.152
I have no idea
how this happened

793
00:35:55.237 --> 00:35:56.695
or how it got there.

794
00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.905
Jen was the last one
to have it.

795
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.274
Yeah.

796
00:36:01.368 --> 00:36:03.034
Why would she do that?

797
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.536
It's complicated.

798
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:05.871
Please don't take it
personally.

799
00:36:05.956 --> 00:36:08.790
Jen got into an argument
with her ex and his girlfriend
today.

800
00:36:08.917 --> 00:36:11.710
and Laura said some
really hurtful things.

801
00:36:14.673 --> 00:36:16.882
It seems like Jen's going
through a lot.

802
00:36:18.677 --> 00:36:20.051
But I will talk to her.

803
00:36:21.471 --> 00:36:23.638
Thank you for everything
you've done today.

804
00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:28.101
I think I can take it
from here.

805
00:36:29.104 --> 00:36:30.478
Oh. okay.

806
00:36:30.606 --> 00:36:33.398
-We'll see you tomorrow.
-Oh yeah. absolutely.

807
00:36:36.403 --> 00:36:37.319
Thanks.

808
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.196
Yeah.

809
00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:41.740
See you tomorrow.

810
00:36:45.746 --> 00:36:46.661
[Laura] Are you ready?

811
00:36:46.788 --> 00:36:49.039
I'm the best soccer player
in the world.

812
00:36:49.124 --> 00:36:50.207
You are. girl.

813
00:36:50.292 --> 00:36:53.668
I remember that last week
you scored... two goals?

814
00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:55.879
No. not two. but three.

815
00:36:55.964 --> 00:36:57.088
[Laura] Three goals?

816
00:36:57.174 --> 00:36:58.506
[Ruby] Not three. but four.

817
00:36:58.634 --> 00:36:59.758
[Laura] Four goals?

818
00:36:59.843 --> 00:37:02.168
Okay. Let's see.
Let's see what you got.
Come on.

819
00:37:02.262 --> 00:37:05.338
Whoa! That was
some fancy footwork. Ruby.

820
00:37:05.432 --> 00:37:07.057
Thank you.

821
00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:10.435
[Laura] Okay. come on.
try me again. Here we go.

-Hey.
-Hey. what--
What are you up to?

824
00:37:17.319 --> 00:37:20.445
Uh. just running errands.

825
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.188
I'm sorry I left in such a
huff.

826
00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:24.691
No. it's okay.

827
00:37:24.785 --> 00:37:27.994
Hey. um. I found that book
that Lily got Olivia

828
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.412
in the trash.

829
00:37:31.124 --> 00:37:32.532
Really?

830
00:37:32.626 --> 00:37:34.960
Hey. did you. um...

831
00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:38.171
Jen. did you rip it up?

832
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.173
What? No.

833
00:37:40.259 --> 00:37:41.374
Are you sure?

834
00:37:41.468 --> 00:37:43.593
Yes. I'm sure.
I think I'd know.

835
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.098
It's just... your temper.

836
00:37:48.183 --> 00:37:49.808
You know what.
Monica. I didn't do it.

837
00:37:49.893 --> 00:37:51.226
and I really don't need
a lecture from you

838
00:37:51.353 --> 00:37:53.395
on anger management right now.
I gotta go.

[Laura] What is it. Ruby?

841
00:38:04.491 --> 00:38:06.065
Nothing.

842
00:38:06.159 --> 00:38:07.075
Is that your mom?

843
00:38:14.793 --> 00:38:15.917
Go get your bag.

Hey. Sam.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:18.581
I have had enough. Monica.
Your sister is out of control.

What's going on?

her?

driving by our house.

and she had
no reason to be there.

885

She is going to pay
for what she's done.

What? What did he say?

887
00:41:06.423 --> 00:41:08.080
That you tried to hurt Laura.

What? It's crazy.

happened today?

890
00:41:12.304 --> 00:41:14.471
I told you.
we had some words. that's it.

891
00:41:14.556 --> 00:41:16.598
I know. I mean later.
like around three or four?

892
00:41:16.725 --> 00:41:19.258
Nothing. I was at the studio.

893
00:41:19.352 --> 00:41:21.478
Sam says you pushed Laura
down a ravine

894
00:41:21.563 --> 00:41:22.520
while she was jogging.

895
00:41:22.606 --> 00:41:25.648
He's lost his mind.
I would never do that.

896
00:41:27.694 --> 00:41:30.778
Mon. I was nowhere near Laura.

897
00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:33.239
This is just some plan to try
and get full custody of Ruby.

898
00:41:33.325 --> 00:41:35.158
Why can't you see that?

899
00:41:35.243 --> 00:41:36.784
All I know is Laura's
in the hospital.

900
00:41:36.912 --> 00:41:37.994
Sam contacted the police

901
00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:40.663
and they filed a restraining
order against you. Jen.

902
00:41:40.749 --> 00:41:42.415
And I don't think
they're making it up.

903
00:41:42.501 --> 00:41:43.950
Why don't you believe me?

904
00:41:44.044 --> 00:41:45.793
[John] Hey. Monica.

905
00:41:45.921 --> 00:41:47.286
My guests are arriving.

906
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.713
We'll talk about this later.

907
00:41:49.925 --> 00:41:51.883
-Hi. John. how are you?
-Hey.

908
00:41:51.968 --> 00:41:54.761
-I'm good.
-It's good to see you.

909
00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:56.963
-[Monica] Come on in.
-[John] Okay.

910
00:41:57.057 --> 00:42:00.099
[upbeat music playing]

911
00:42:10.529 --> 00:42:13.363
These are--
These are really nice. yeah?

912
00:42:15.075 --> 00:42:16.950
-[Brad] Thank you.
-Yeah. of course.

913
00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:18.451
Happy birthday.

914
00:42:20.038 --> 00:42:21.996
[ominous music playing]

915
00:42:22.123 --> 00:42:25.291
[indistinct talking]

916
00:42:25.377 --> 00:42:27.460
[ominous music continues]

917
00:42:34.261 --> 00:42:37.303
[people laughing and chatting]

918
00:42:42.143 --> 00:42:45.687
[chatter and laughter
continues]

919
00:42:48.108 --> 00:42:50.316
[ominous music continues]

920
00:43:01.413 --> 00:43:03.029
[Brad]
Thank you for the party. babe.

921
00:43:03.123 --> 00:43:05.206
You really outdid yourself.

922
00:43:06.376 --> 00:43:08.293
I'm gonna go check on Olivia.

923
00:43:08.378 --> 00:43:11.921
Oh. uh. Brad. I had.
um. a little extra time.

924
00:43:12.007 --> 00:43:14.716
Uh. so I reorganised
your closet.

925
00:43:14.843 --> 00:43:16.384
and your pyjamas
are on the bottom shelf.

926
00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:18.011
Wow. Really?

927
00:43:18.096 --> 00:43:19.762
[Brad] Well. thank you.

928
00:43:19.848 --> 00:43:21.764
[Lily]
And I made you overnight oats
for tomorrow morning.

929
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:25.184
You are the best.
What would we do without you?

930
00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:29.939
Hey. Lily.
can you give us a minute?

931
00:43:33.028 --> 00:43:34.060
Yeah. sure.

932
00:43:34.154 --> 00:43:35.028
[Monica] Thank you.

933
00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:39.732
I'm very worried
about you. Jen.

934
00:43:39.826 --> 00:43:41.409
You sound like Mom.

935
00:43:41.536 --> 00:43:42.660
It's gross.

936
00:43:45.165 --> 00:43:46.080
I didn't do anything.

937
00:43:46.207 --> 00:43:48.416
So there's nothing for you
to worry about.

938
00:43:48.543 --> 00:43:50.126
All right. well.
let's go over it then.

939
00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:54.464
Um. when you left here.
you went to the studio?

940
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:56.215
Yeah.

941
00:43:56.301 --> 00:43:58.885
Then why is Laura saying
you were driving by her house?

942
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.178
Because she's crazy. okay?

943
00:44:00.263 --> 00:44:01.262
And out to get me.

944
00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:05.257
[Monica] Jen. you called me
from her street.

945
00:44:05.352 --> 00:44:07.268
I saw the neighbour's house
in the background.

946
00:44:08.772 --> 00:44:09.854
So?

947
00:44:10.649 --> 00:44:12.065
Okay.

948
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:15.068
I went to see Ruby
for a minute.

949
00:44:15.153 --> 00:44:16.319
[Jen] Monica.
you don't understand.

950
00:44:16.404 --> 00:44:18.321
That woman lives
with my child.

951
00:44:20.408 --> 00:44:24.786
She takes her to dance class
and soccer practice.

952
00:44:24.913 --> 00:44:26.287
She does her nails.

953
00:44:28.708 --> 00:44:30.833
You know.
Laura even said she was

954
00:44:30.919 --> 00:44:32.835
more like Ruby's mother
than I was.

955
00:44:34.255 --> 00:44:36.214
I do know how hard
this is for you.

956
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:39.300
but I don't think you
appreciate

957
00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:41.678
how much trouble
you could be in. Jen.

958
00:44:41.763 --> 00:44:43.054
[Monica] So just...

959
00:44:46.226 --> 00:44:47.392
Be honest with me.

960
00:44:47.477 --> 00:44:48.768
I can not believe
that you think

961
00:44:48.853 --> 00:44:50.728
that I would hurt her
or anyone.

962
00:44:50.814 --> 00:44:52.805
Look. I know
I've had my issues.

963
00:44:52.899 --> 00:44:55.141
but just how messed up
do you think I am?

964
00:44:55.235 --> 00:44:57.476
If you were in the park
when Laura got hurt.

965
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:58.486
I need to know.

966
00:44:58.613 --> 00:45:01.147
You are making me out
to be a bad one.

967
00:45:01.241 --> 00:45:02.615
Just like. you've always done.

968
00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:03.991
I'm trying to help you.

969
00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:05.985
I cannot believe you. Monica.

970
00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:07.453
You are my sister.

971
00:45:07.539 --> 00:45:09.580
You are the one person
in this entire world

972
00:45:09.666 --> 00:45:12.324
that is supposed
to stand by me and believe me!

973
00:45:12.419 --> 00:45:13.960
Jen. Jen!

974
00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:15.086
No!

975
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:17.422
[dramatic music]

976
00:45:26.766 --> 00:45:29.842
Jen. you almost set
my entire backyard on fire.

977
00:45:29.936 --> 00:45:31.102
Well. I'm sorry. okay?

978
00:45:31.187 --> 00:45:33.512
You know what?
Just don't come back here
anymore.

979
00:45:33.606 --> 00:45:34.847
not until you've got
professional help.

980
00:45:34.941 --> 00:45:36.515
because you are not yourself.

981
00:45:36.609 --> 00:45:38.776
And I do not want you
around Olivia
like this anymore.

982
00:45:38.862 --> 00:45:40.186
What?

983
00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.520
I'm her aunt.

984
00:45:41.614 --> 00:45:42.822
Don't you take her
away from me too.

985
00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:43.856
Why are you punishing me?

986
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.742
I'm not punishing you.

987
00:45:50.165 --> 00:45:52.206
Are you afraid of me?

988
00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:53.866
No.

989
00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.627
I need space. Jen.

990
00:45:56.713 --> 00:45:58.370
[Monica]
I'll still represent you.

991
00:45:58.465 --> 00:46:00.206
but I think we
both need some time

992
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.924
to just breathe. separately.

993
00:46:03.136 --> 00:46:04.427
Whatever's going on
with you. Jen.

994
00:46:04.512 --> 00:46:06.045
I clearly--

995
00:46:06.139 --> 00:46:08.181
I'm not capable of helping you
the way you need.

996
00:46:09.809 --> 00:46:11.017
You're killing me. Monica.

997
00:46:12.979 --> 00:46:14.729
You're killing me!

998
00:46:15.774 --> 00:46:17.565
Jen!

999
00:46:17.692 --> 00:46:18.733
[Monica] Stop!

1000
00:46:21.696 --> 00:46:23.696
It's not for ever. Jen!

1001
00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:26.365
Jen!

1002
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:30.077
Jen.

1003
00:46:31.623 --> 00:46:33.122
Babe.

1004
00:46:34.334 --> 00:46:35.249
[Brad] Get inside.

1005
00:46:36.294 --> 00:46:38.085
[ominous music playing]

1006
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:47.720
Brad. you have
a work dinner tonight. right?

1007
00:46:47.806 --> 00:46:49.514
No. it turned
into just drinks.

1008
00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:52.225
-This is delicious. Lily.
-Good.

1009
00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:53.926
You're babysitting
tonight. right?

1010
00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.395
Yes. Um. is it okay
if I swing by my mom's house

1011
00:46:56.481 --> 00:46:57.730
with Olivia later today?

1012
00:46:57.816 --> 00:46:59.106
She's dying to meet her.

1013
00:46:59.234 --> 00:47:01.267
It's not far.

1014
00:47:01.361 --> 00:47:03.986
Of course. I didn't even know
your mom lived in the area.

1015
00:47:04.072 --> 00:47:06.072
You know. she's always
welcome here. too.

1016
00:47:06.157 --> 00:47:07.532
Would love to meet her
sometime.

1017
00:47:07.617 --> 00:47:09.826
Thank you. It's very sweet.

1018
00:47:09.911 --> 00:47:11.994
[sighs] Great.

1019
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:12.945
What's wrong?

1020
00:47:13.039 --> 00:47:14.613
I've got a meeting
with Jen tonight

1021
00:47:14.707 --> 00:47:16.541
for the first time
since everything.

1022
00:47:16.626 --> 00:47:18.668
Sam's going for the jugular.

1023
00:47:18.753 --> 00:47:20.461
But you haven't spoken to her
at all?

1024
00:47:20.588 --> 00:47:22.788
And only about her case.

1025
00:47:22.882 --> 00:47:24.966
Luckily Sam
had to drop the charges.

1026
00:47:25.093 --> 00:47:26.008
-[Brad] That's good.
-[Monica] Yeah.

1027
00:47:26.094 --> 00:47:27.760
I mean. they don't
have enough evidence.

1028
00:47:27.846 --> 00:47:28.794
Laura didn't actually
see her face.

1029
00:47:28.888 --> 00:47:31.222
and the DA didn't think
it would hold up.

1030
00:47:31.307 --> 00:47:33.224
but like her custody issues.

1031
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:34.725
it's a whole nother battle.

1032
00:47:34.811 --> 00:47:35.810
Oh. drinks won't take
that long.

1033
00:47:35.937 --> 00:47:38.729
How about I meet you
at your office. for backup?

1034
00:47:38.815 --> 00:47:40.398
I got you. babe.

1035
00:47:40.483 --> 00:47:41.983
Mm-hmm.

1036
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.693
-Thanks.
-[Brad] Yeah.

1037
00:47:43.778 --> 00:47:44.810
[Monica] Bye. Lily.

1038
00:47:44.904 --> 00:47:46.153
Oh. bye. guys.

1039
00:47:47.407 --> 00:47:49.282
[suspenseful music playing]

1040
00:47:57.458 --> 00:48:01.627
"Lily has a new post!"

1041
00:48:01.713 --> 00:48:03.880
[dramatic music]

1042
00:48:19.689 --> 00:48:20.563
Hi.

1043
00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:22.315
Hi.

1044
00:48:23.776 --> 00:48:25.109
Are you okay?

1045
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.698
Sam and Laura aren't happy.

1046
00:48:30.825 --> 00:48:33.692
Laura's filed
a restraining order
against you.

1047
00:48:33.786 --> 00:48:36.203
I didn't do it.
They don't have any evidence.

1048
00:48:36.331 --> 00:48:38.664
They're using the day
you lunged at Laura

1049
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.374
to prove you are a threat.

1050
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.134
What about Ruby's
dance classes and recitals?

1051
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.345
Laura's her dance teacher.

1052
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:54.764
Will I still be able
to go to them?

1053
00:48:54.849 --> 00:48:57.716
If the judge approves
the restraining order. then...

1054
00:48:57.810 --> 00:48:59.101
probably not.

1055
00:49:00.438 --> 00:49:01.720
This is absurd.

1056
00:49:01.814 --> 00:49:03.648
We will fight it.

1057
00:49:03.733 --> 00:49:05.983
They're still filing
for full custody. right?

1058
00:49:08.279 --> 00:49:09.320
Yes.

1059
00:49:12.492 --> 00:49:14.233
Mon. I'm losing everything.

1060
00:49:14.327 --> 00:49:16.744
Everything
that means anything to me...

1061
00:49:16.871 --> 00:49:18.913
My daughter. my niece.

1062
00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.906
I can't lose Ruby and Olivia.

1063
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.041
You won't.

1064
00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:23.334
[sobs]

1065
00:49:24.879 --> 00:49:27.296
And I'm not having Lily
calling herself Aunt Lily.

1066
00:49:27.382 --> 00:49:30.383
-What?

[clang]

1421
01:08:20.639 --> 01:08:22.597
Hurry before the neighbours
call the police.

1422
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.225
-Careful.
-Let's go.

1423
01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:31.272
Lily.

1424
01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:36.611
[ominous music continues]

[ominous music continues]

1430
01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.107
Mon. look at this.

1431
01:09:58.069 --> 01:10:01.112
-What?
-It's about Lily and her mom.

1432
01:10:01.198 --> 01:10:03.406
"Grandmother steals
adopted baby back."

1433
01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:04.982
[Jen] Look at the date.

1434
01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:06.868
That's the year
Lily had her first baby.

1435
01:10:09.206 --> 01:10:11.656
[ominous music continues]

1436
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.291
[Jen] Lily always said
it was such a gift

1437
01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.959
to give her baby
up for adoption.

1438
01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:18.046
This says she was devastated.

1439
01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:20.131
Her mom tried to
steal the baby back.

1440
01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:21.841
And her mom
went to jail for it.

1441
01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.640
[Jen]
Does it say her mom's name?

1442
01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.511
Susan Loures.

1443
01:10:33.605 --> 01:10:34.979
Susan's a criminal.

1444
01:10:35.065 --> 01:10:37.014
She could have kidnapped
Lily and Olivia.

1445
01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:38.683
Google her name
and find an address.

1446
01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:40.518
because I know
she lives close by.

1447
01:10:40.612 --> 01:10:42.153
[Monica]
Maybe Lily took Olivia there.

1448
01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:43.688
[Jen] I'll take a look.

1449
01:10:43.782 --> 01:10:44.614
[gasps]

1450
01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:47.408
Someone's here.

1451
01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:48.368
Why do we?

1452
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.031
Where do you think
you're going?

1453
01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:56.000
Don't make a move.

1454
01:10:56.086 --> 01:10:57.627
Sir.

1455
01:10:57.712 --> 01:11:00.672
I'm a lawyer. This is the home
of my employee.

1456
01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.039
I'm calling the police.

1457
01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:03.541
Just put the bat down. I can--

1458
01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:05.551
-I can explain.
-No explaining.

1459
01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:07.679
You broke in. I caught you.

1460
01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.547
[operator] 911.
What's the nature
of your emergency?

1461
01:11:09.641 --> 01:11:14.018
I found two women breaking
into my neighbour's house.

1462
01:11:14.104 --> 01:11:16.604
Tell them
there's an Amber Alert
out for my baby.

1463
01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:17.605
Olivia Hunt.

1464
01:11:17.691 --> 01:11:19.607
[operator]
Did someone say Olivia Hunt?

1465
01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.068
Hey.

1466
01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:23.778
Hey!

1467
01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:26.114
[operator] Sir. do you have Olivia Hunt?

1468
01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:36.124
[Susan]
What are you doing. Lily?

1469
01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:37.125
Just where is it. Mom?

1470
01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:38.743
I know that you hide
the money somewhere.

1471
01:11:38.837 --> 01:11:40.336
You're not taking my money.

1472
01:11:40.422 --> 01:11:41.579
I'm going to pay you back.

1473
01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:42.755
You just tell me where it is.

1474
01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:44.757
I need to go.
I need to go now.

1475
01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:45.925
Go where?

1476
01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:47.585
And what about Olivia?

1477
01:11:47.679 --> 01:11:49.086
She's coming with me.

1478
01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:52.098
You are not going to take
that baby.

1479
01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:54.225
No. you don't get to tell me.

1480
01:11:54.311 --> 01:11:56.093
Ever since you took my baby
away from me.

1481
01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:57.645
it's all I can think about.

1482
01:11:59.441 --> 01:12:01.316
Every time I see
a mother with her daughter.

1483
01:12:01.401 --> 01:12:03.768
I wonder where my baby is.

1484
01:12:03.862 --> 01:12:05.770
and how some other woman
gets to raise her

1485
01:12:05.864 --> 01:12:06.696
instead of me.

1486
01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:12.118
You have no idea
what that's done to me.

1487
01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:19.792
But Olivia...

1488
01:12:24.758 --> 01:12:26.966
[Lily] She's given me
my happiness back...

1489
01:12:28.887 --> 01:12:29.844
My purpose...

1490
01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:35.808
And you don't get
to take it from me.

1491
01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:39.470
[Susan] It was
the right decision
at the time.

1492
01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:42.523
You were so young. you were
practically a baby yourself.

1493
01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:46.569
And I covered for you.

1494
01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:48.446
Remember?

1495
01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:54.285
I took the blame
for what you did. Lily.

1496
01:12:57.916 --> 01:12:59.040
[Jen] We're close.

1497
01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.458
23 Deem Road.

1498
01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:03.661
What's our plan
when we get there?

1499
01:13:03.755 --> 01:13:06.214
To find Olivia. At any cost.

1500
01:13:08.176 --> 01:13:12.053
I went to prison for you when
you tried to steal that baby.

1501
01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:13.638
It was my baby.

1502
01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.973
And when you got caught...

1503
01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:20.061
I told them I did it.

1504
01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:23.314
cause that's what a mother
does for her daughter.

1505
01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.524
She protects her daughter.

1506
01:13:24.651 --> 01:13:26.901
but I will not protect you
again!

1507
01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:30.113
So. you're just gonna leave
threatening notes on my door?

1508
01:13:30.198 --> 01:13:32.240
I had to keep an eye on you

1509
01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:34.358
because I know
what you've been doing.

1510
01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:36.536
You should have just called me
and told me you were home.

1511
01:13:37.789 --> 01:13:39.080
You stopped calling.

1512
01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.032
All those years.
you didn't even visit.

1513
01:13:42.127 --> 01:13:44.085
Yeah.
because you ruined my life.

1514
01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:47.672
You ruined my life.
I was empty.

1515
01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.215
[Lily] I was destroyed.

1516
01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:51.926
I met Monica and Brad

1517
01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:54.303
and they offered me
something special.

1518
01:13:56.975 --> 01:13:59.142
And I thought if-- if I--
if I helped them.

1519
01:13:59.227 --> 01:14:01.853
it would fill
the emptiness in me.

1520
01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:03.604
[emotional music playing]

1521
01:14:05.275 --> 01:14:06.941
But Olivia did. instead.

1522
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:18.786
And that's how I knew
Monica had to die.

1523
01:14:19.289 --> 01:14:21.071
What?

1524
01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:22.707
I set it up perfectly.

1525
01:14:24.377 --> 01:14:26.243
Set the sister up
to take the blame.

1526
01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:29.246
Jen. with all her--
her bad temper and her--

1527
01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.757
her custody issues.

1528
01:14:31.885 --> 01:14:34.051
and then-- then Brad.
Brad would-- would turn to me.

1529
01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:37.305
And then I have
the family I've always wanted.

1530
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:40.016
Everything was going to plan.

1531
01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:41.759
Every detail was lining up.

1532
01:14:41.853 --> 01:14:44.762
so that it looked like Jen.

1533
01:14:44.856 --> 01:14:47.565
and that no one
would ever suspect me.

1534
01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:52.904
But I messed up.

1535
01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:57.783
And there's no going back now.

1536
01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:01.537
[music crescendo]

1537
01:15:05.585 --> 01:15:07.335
Were you able
to get through to the police?

1538
01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.961
Calls keep dropping.

1539
01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:11.172
And now of the map's frozen.
We're close.

1540
01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:13.633
I-- I just don't know
exactly how close.

1541
01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.220
Thank you
for getting us this far.

1542
01:15:18.932 --> 01:15:20.097
And for coming with me.

1543
01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:25.186
You've always
looked out for me.

1544
01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:27.813
and Mon.
we're going to find Olivia.

1545
01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:32.643
Jen!

1546
01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:35.312
Her car's in the driveway.
Lily's car.

1547
01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:36.614
[Monica] It's there.

1548
01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:44.997
-You ready?
-I think we should
find some cell service

1549
01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:46.156
and call the police.

1550
01:15:46.251 --> 01:15:48.626
I can't sit here knowing
Olivia's inside there.

1551
01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.828
I think I can talk Lily
out of doing anything crazy.

1552
01:15:50.922 --> 01:15:52.964
Monica. she tried to kill you.
She's dangerous.

1553
01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:54.006
Fine.

1554
01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.332
You'll get the police.

1555
01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:56.509
I'm getting my baby.

1556
01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:01.764
I'm not leaving you. Monica.

1557
01:16:05.603 --> 01:16:06.727
-Dammit.
-[Olivia crying]

1558
01:16:06.813 --> 01:16:10.014
Lily. you have to give
this baby back to her mother.

1559
01:16:10.108 --> 01:16:11.849
I am her mother.

1560
01:16:11.943 --> 01:16:13.183
Stop mothering me.

1561
01:16:13.278 --> 01:16:14.852
I don't need you.

1562
01:16:14.946 --> 01:16:16.520
I never did.

1563
01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:17.905
Now. I have everything I need.

1564
01:16:17.991 --> 01:16:19.323
I have Olivia.

1565
01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:21.692
You're not your right mind.
You need help.

1566
01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:22.827
You can't stop me.

1567
01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:25.371
Not this time.

[ominous music playing]

1569
01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:40.469
Thanks. Mom.

1570
01:16:43.224 --> 01:16:44.724
You've been a real help.

1571
01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:53.608
[Jen] The diaper bag.

1572
01:16:56.988 --> 01:16:58.228
Where are you going?

1573
01:16:58.323 --> 01:16:59.697
No. Lily. no stop.

1574
01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:00.731
Lily!

1575
01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:03.909
No. Lily. No stop. Lily!

[suspenseful music continues]

1579
01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:38.944
[Monica] Lily?

1580
01:17:41.366 --> 01:17:42.948
Just tell me what's going on.

1581
01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:46.443
[Lily] She's my baby.

1582
01:17:46.537 --> 01:17:48.371
I made her. not you.

1583
01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.707
Give Olivia to me.

1584
01:17:51.793 --> 01:17:53.793
and everything will be okay.

1585
01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:56.045
[Monica] Lily.

1586
01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.299
[ominous music playing]

1587
01:18:04.305 --> 01:18:06.347
[Lily] All I wanted.
was to be a mother.

1588
01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:09.133
and I was about
to have my family

1589
01:18:09.227 --> 01:18:11.602
when-- when my mom
made me give up my baby.

1590
01:18:13.731 --> 01:18:17.858
I cannot imagine how much pain
that must have been. Lily.

1591
01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:20.945
but this is different.

1592
01:18:22.115 --> 01:18:23.155
You see that. right?

1593
01:18:26.828 --> 01:18:28.703
My boyfriend said
that we could have
