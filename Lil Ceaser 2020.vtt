00:45:41.564 --> 00:45:43.044
How you doing?

707
00:45:43.088 --> 00:45:43.915
You gotta take care it yourself.

708
00:45:43.958 --> 00:45:45.351
or somebody will do it for you?

709
00:45:45.394 --> 00:45:46.352
- I'm good.

710
00:45:46.395 --> 00:45:47.222
- All right.

711
00:45:53.489 --> 00:45:56.841
Slim. Slim. Slim. where
Poppa Benny gonna be?

712
00:45:59.626 --> 00:46:00.322
- Not where you gonna be.

713
00:46:08.113 --> 00:46:09.897
- You hear him over there?

714
00:46:09.941 --> 00:46:12.204
How is the ride down here?

715
00:46:12.247 --> 00:46:13.988
- It was good.

716
00:46:14.032 --> 00:46:15.468
- Man. I was riding
down the road.

717
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:16.948
Pony gave him a couple.

718
00:46:16.991 --> 00:46:19.994
[car engine roaring]

719
00:46:31.614 --> 00:46:33.965
[hubbub]

720
00:46:34.008 --> 00:46:37.316
- Okay baby. so
Timmy. how you been?

721
00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:37.925
- I'm good.

722
00:46:40.232 --> 00:46:42.190
- [Narrator] Every now and then.

723
00:46:42.234 --> 00:46:44.497
Poppa Benny would take
Timmy out to lunch.

724
00:46:46.629 --> 00:46:50.851
kick it with him. spend some
time with the little barber.

725
00:46:52.548 --> 00:46:55.682
And his wife Leslie. she
was fine by Timmy too.

726
00:46:57.379 --> 00:47:02.994
It was almost like an outing
on a family structure.

727
00:47:03.037 --> 00:47:04.256
That was something Timmy needed.

728
00:47:06.214 --> 00:47:08.477
Poppa Benny supplied
that for him.

729
00:47:08.521 --> 00:47:10.436
he was more like his nest.

730
00:47:12.525 --> 00:47:15.136
He knows he felt
secure in there.

731
00:47:16.355 --> 00:47:17.225
He loved him.

732
00:47:32.588 --> 00:47:34.112
- Slim. Slim. Slim.

733
00:47:35.765 --> 00:47:37.724
What's going on Slim?

734
00:47:37.767 --> 00:47:40.770
I got a favor to talk
about here with you.

735
00:47:40.814 --> 00:47:43.425
Back in the days when I was
a baller. trying to come up.

736
00:47:45.775 --> 00:47:48.474
I went to one of my guys. to
buy a couple of them things.

737
00:47:50.302 --> 00:47:52.739
I asked him the price
and he told me the price.

738
00:47:52.782 --> 00:47:56.003
I said. damn. can you
cut it a little bit?

739
00:47:56.047 --> 00:48:01.661
'Cause we homies. he
said. yeah we friends.

740
00:48:01.704 --> 00:48:02.618
but this is a business.

741
00:48:03.706 --> 00:48:05.578
You understand?

742
00:48:05.621 --> 00:48:08.015
This is a business. and he
couldn't do that for me.

743
00:48:09.538 --> 00:48:13.586
So later on at night.
me and my friends.

744
00:48:13.629 --> 00:48:15.805
we went up to his room.

745
00:48:15.849 --> 00:48:16.763
He was knocked the fuck out.

746
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:19.722
Girl must have put
the pussy on him.

747
00:48:19.766 --> 00:48:20.985
She must've had the bomb.

748
00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:23.204
I woke him up.

749
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:27.774
[chuckling]

750
00:48:27.817 --> 00:48:28.862
I asked him where the work at.

751
00:48:32.126 --> 00:48:34.085
He said. I ain't
telling you shit.

752
00:48:35.738 --> 00:48:38.524
I said. wait a minute.
man. where they're work at?

753
00:48:38.567 --> 00:48:41.266
Again. he said. I
ain't telling you shit.

754
00:48:41.309 --> 00:48:44.225
So I tell Pony.

755
00:48:44.269 --> 00:48:46.662
I say Pony. give him some.

756
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.667
Pony hit that nigga square
across the bridge of his nose

757
00:48:51.711 --> 00:48:54.757
and broke it. and you know what?

758
00:48:54.801 --> 00:48:57.543
He still didn't tell
me where the work was.

759
00:49:00.024 --> 00:49:04.506
I said. I'm gonna
take my time with him.

760
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.683
Juju. go get me an iron

761
00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:10.860

00:49:19.869 --> 00:49:21.567
And you know what I did.

765
00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:24.787
I dropped that arrogant square
on his motherfucking ass.

766
00:49:24.831 --> 00:49:26.659
And you know that
motherfucker screamed?

767
00:49:28.878 --> 00:49:30.097
You know he screamed?

768
00:49:31.664 --> 00:49:32.186
But you know what?

769
00:49:33.448 --> 00:49:34.667

770
00:49:36.582 --> 00:49:39.106
[chuckling]

771
00:49:45.634 --> 00:49:47.941

stopped being Timmy
and became Timmy.

796
00:52:42.507 --> 00:52:45.249
You can only back
a person up so far.

797
00:52:47.903 --> 00:52:50.428
A balloon can only
take so much air.

798

Then what's going on?

808
00:53:41.174 --> 00:53:42.567
- Let me ask you this question.

809
00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:44.482
every time I asked you
about my mom and dad.

00:53:58.626 --> 00:54:01.455
Walking down the street.
I seen a guy on a corner.

815
00:54:03.022 --> 00:54:04.980
He's giving out orders.

816
00:54:05.024 --> 00:54:07.896
the ladies liked him and
the bros respected him.

817
00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:08.462
like a boss.

818
00:54:10.421 --> 00:54:13.206
Hey. he was the boss of bosses.

819
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:15.861
So I said. I'm going

820
00:54:15.904 --> 00:54:17.732
- And then what happened?

821
00:54:17.776 --> 00:54:19.168

he gave me a couple of dollars.

837
00:54:52.245 --> 00:54:53.681
I ran that street like
I had a lot of money.

838
00:54:53.725 --> 00:54:55.683
[laughing]

839
00:54:58.686 --> 00:55:02.037
The only thing I'm gonna say

- Hey Timmy. bad things
happen to good people.

But I can tell you one
thing. she loved you.

- If she loved me. then
why'd she leave me?

850

in that [mumbles] white envelope

1168

and that hurts the business.

1169
01:24:48.953 --> 01:24:52.739
but I asked Littles and
Esquire to handle it.

1170
01:24:52.783 --> 01:24:55.742
But we need to get the family
together to get the solution.
