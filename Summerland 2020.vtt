00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:49.793
Damn it.

4
00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:56.418
I'll just start again.

5
00:00:58.334 --> 00:01:00.501
Start from the top.
Right.

6
00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:12.668
<i>Miss Lamb.</i>

7
00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:17.918
What?

8
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:19.918
Well. spit it out.

9
00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:21.376
We're collecting for charity.

10
00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:22.209
Good for you.

11
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:23.584
It's for Help the Aged.

12
00:01:23.626 --> 00:01:25.293
You know how you can
help the aged?

13
00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:26.834
You can bugger off.

14
00:02:10.126 --> 00:02:11.543
Let's look.

15
00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:13.834
- It's a map.
- What? Let me see.

16
00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:15.168
<i>- A map?
- Oh. look.</i>

17
00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.626
<i>Nazi spy.
Right there.</i>

18
00:02:18.293 --> 00:02:20.459
Come on. follow me.

19
00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:27.793
Go. go. go.
Come on. Quick.

20
00:02:28.334 --> 00:02:29.434
- Oi!
<i>- Nazi witch!</i>

21
00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.584
<i>Nazi spy!</i>

22
00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:44.751
<i>Oh. Miss Lamb.</i>

23
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:46.834
<i>Miss Lamb.</i>

24
00:02:46.876 --> 00:02:49.043
<i>it's the WVS meeting tonight.</i>

25
00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:50.793
Can I count you in?

26
00:02:53.376 --> 00:02:55.418
Unbelievable.

27
00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:03.043
Oh. Lord.

28
00:03:11.376 --> 00:03:13.043
I will go to the police.

29
00:03:13.084 --> 00:03:14.626
Look. they're just children.

30
00:03:14.668 --> 00:03:16.043
Or buy a shotgun.

31
00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:17.751
<i>- Please. Miss Lamb...
- It's my property!</i>

32
00:03:17.793 --> 00:03:18.668
I won't have it.

33
00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.959
Perhaps if you didn't
provoke them...

34
00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:27.293
<i>Miss Lamb.</i>

35
00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.668
Miss Lamb!

36
00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.168
"Upon the heat and flame
of thy distemper.

37
00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.834
- sprinkle cool patience. sir."
- Wha...?

38
00:03:34.876 --> 00:03:36.084
As the Bard said.

39
00:03:36.126 --> 00:03:37.043
Yeah.

40
00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:39.043
Shakespeare didn't have
to deal with Alice Lamb.

41
00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:40.418
though. did he?

42
00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.793
Or he might have said.
"Get thee under the table

43
00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:44.001
and hide."

44
00:03:56.126 --> 00:03:58.168
<i>Yes. Who's next...</i>

45
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:07.834
Ooh. no. darling. not today.

46
00:04:07.876 --> 00:04:09.168
I want it.

47
00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.894
We don't have enough coupons
for chocolate. sweetheart.

48
00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:12.293
You'll have to wait
till next week.

49
00:04:12.334 --> 00:04:14.793
That's right.
We've all got to do our bit.

50
00:04:14.834 --> 00:04:15.668
Can't I just have a little bit?

51
00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.685
You couldn't let us.
just this once. could you. Mew?

52
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.584
I'm sorry.
I wish I could.

53
00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.251
I'll have a packet of Westerley.

54
00:04:34.376 --> 00:04:35.476
And this.

55
00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:38.543
That is so kind.

56
00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:40.293
W-What do you say
to the nice lady. Martha?

57
00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:41.793
That's two coupons.

58
00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:24.168
<i>Miss Lamb?</i>

59
00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:29.043
What?

60
00:05:29.084 --> 00:05:30.751
We were expecting you
an hour ago.

61
00:05:30.793 --> 00:05:31.376
Sorry?

62
00:05:31.418 --> 00:05:33.334
The others were met
at the station.

63
00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:35.251
Fancy leaving poor Frank
on his own.

64
00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:36.959
- Frank?
- Frank?

65
00:05:40.793 --> 00:05:42.834
This is Miss Lamb.
your new guardian.

66
00:05:44.084 --> 00:05:45.269
- There's been a mistake.
- No.

67
00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:47.751
- You've got the wrong house.
- Alice Lamb. Dune Cottage.

68
00:05:47.793 --> 00:05:49.084
- Yes. but--
- In you go. Frank.

69
00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:50.626
No. you don't.
I don't want him.

70
00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:52.084
You can't refuse.

71
00:05:52.126 --> 00:05:53.293
You had a letter.

72
00:05:53.793 --> 00:05:54.543
No. I didn't.

73
00:05:54.584 --> 00:05:55.918
You must have...

74
00:06:19.584 --> 00:06:20.584
What did I tell you?

75
00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:21.626
We've all got to do our bit.

76
00:06:21.668 --> 00:06:23.168
So you take him.
I'm working.

77
00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:24.834
I have four of my own.

78
00:06:24.876 --> 00:06:25.751
More fool you.

79
00:06:25.793 --> 00:06:27.293
You should have been
more careful.

80
00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:29.418
Get inside.
Go on.

81
00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:30.626
Get out.

82
00:06:30.668 --> 00:06:32.334
- No. you don't!
- Oh. for pity's sake!

83
00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:35.168
We're struggling enough
to find families.

84
00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:36.727
I'll need at least a week
to find him somewhere else.

85
00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:37.852
You'll have to take him
till then.

86
00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:39.209
I'm in the middle of a draft.

87
00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:41.310
And if you really can't find it
in your heart to keep him.

88
00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:42.918
then bring him to the school
next week

89
00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.269
and we'll have to
make arrangements.

90
00:06:44.293 --> 00:06:46.959
- But...
- A week. that's all.

91
00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:50.543
I'm sorry. son.

92
00:07:43.168 --> 00:07:44.376
You're touching my things.

93
00:07:46.001 --> 00:07:47.501
Don't touch my things.

94
00:07:48.084 --> 00:07:49.376
I'm not.

95
00:07:50.334 --> 00:07:51.584
Do you think you're funny?

96
00:07:53.376 --> 00:07:54.584
What's for dinner?

97
00:08:03.876 --> 00:08:06.168
You don't expect me
to cook it for you?

98
00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:08.459
There's the stove.

99
00:08:20.251 --> 00:08:21.751
Need anything?

100
00:08:22.918 --> 00:08:24.751
I always have milk
before bedtime.

101
00:08:24.793 --> 00:08:25.959
Good for you.

102
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:27.959
Bathroom's there.
Don't touch my creams.

103
00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:48.168
It's my dad's.

104
00:08:48.209 --> 00:08:49.626
Pilot. is he?

105
00:08:49.668 --> 00:08:51.293
In Twenty-one Squadron.

106
00:08:51.793 --> 00:08:52.893
Do you like planes?

107
00:08:53.376 --> 00:08:54.476
I hate them.

108
00:08:55.543 --> 00:08:56.918
They murder my sleep.

109
00:08:57.168 --> 00:08:58.626
He's got two medals.

110
00:09:15.543 --> 00:09:17.209
What?

111
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:19.668
I'm supposed to go to school.

112
00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:20.809
Well. go on. then.

113
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:23.834
Where is it?

114
00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:27.084
I could not go to school.
I wouldn't mind.

115
00:09:27.126 --> 00:09:28.834
You can't be stupid
all your life.

116
00:09:32.293 --> 00:09:33.543
Donk!

117
00:09:37.084 --> 00:09:38.184
Miss Lamb.

118
00:09:39.626 --> 00:09:41.251
What a pleasure to see you
again so soon.

119
00:09:41.293 --> 00:09:42.918
I want to give him back.

120
00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:45.334
Welcome to St Nicholas. my boy.

121
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:46.959
Best school in the country.

122
00:09:47.001 --> 00:09:48.543
You'll be in Class Two.

123
00:09:48.584 --> 00:09:49.793
Miss Poskitt!

124
00:09:50.543 --> 00:09:51.834
Why don't you come with me?

125
00:09:53.168 --> 00:09:56.209
Go on. then.
No one likes a coward.

126
00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:02.209
I do hope he's settling in.

127
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:03.293
When can I get rid of him?

128
00:10:03.334 --> 00:10:05.709
It's going to be terribly difficult
to find him somewhere

129
00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:07.376
Then you'd better start trying.

130
00:10:07.626 --> 00:10:10.543
Listen. I know you're busy
writing your stories...

131
00:10:11.584 --> 00:10:12.918
Academic theses.

132
00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:15.834
Just wonder whether
you might try.

133
00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:19.168
He could end up
further away from his mother!

134
00:10:23.043 --> 00:10:24.543
<i>This is Frank.</i>

135
00:10:24.584 --> 00:10:26.918
He's an evacuee from London.

136
00:10:29.209 --> 00:10:31.459
Why don't we find you
somewhere to sit?

137
00:10:34.001 --> 00:10:37.293
Here. next to Edie.
when she deigns to arrive.

138
00:10:39.543 --> 00:10:43.251
Edie Corey. one more late
and I'll keep you after school.

139
00:10:43.293 --> 00:10:44.709
Be good. Class Two.

140
00:10:44.751 --> 00:10:45.851
Mrs Bassett.

141
00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:49.126
This is Frank.

142
00:10:49.168 --> 00:10:50.751
You can be partners.

143
00:10:50.793 --> 00:10:52.626
Be nice. please.

144
00:11:10.459 --> 00:11:11.459
I don't believe in partners.

145
00:11:11.501 --> 00:11:12.668
Spelling books out.

146
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:15.251
Frank. you can share with Edie.

147
00:11:15.293 --> 00:11:16.751
Or sharing.

148
00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:18.501
Why not?

149
00:11:18.543 --> 00:11:20.334
I'm an individualist.

150
00:11:20.376 --> 00:11:22.043
<i>Wreck.</i>

151
00:11:22.543 --> 00:11:24.709
It's a person who shows
independence of thought

00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:26.876
- and/or action.
<i>- Wrung. Bristle.</i>

153
00:11:26.918 --> 00:11:28.043
- I'm a maverick.
<i>- Hustle.</i>

154
00:11:28.084 --> 00:11:29.834
I just got told to sit here.

155
00:11:29.876 --> 00:11:32.293
- Mavericks don't follow rules.
<i>- Biscuit.</i>

156
00:11:32.334 --> 00:11:33.434
We're free thinkers.

Edie Corey. spelling list.

158
00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:39.029
<i>Crumbs.
What you get from biscuit.</i>

159
00:11:40.418 --> 00:11:41.584
What?

160
00:12:37.043 --> 00:12:38.626
<i>This seat here is free.
isn't it?</i>

161
00:12:40.668 --> 00:12:42.251
<i>You get stood up. too?</i>

162
00:12:42.834 --> 00:12:44.918
<i>Actually. I came on my own.</i>

163
00:12:48.918 --> 00:12:50.293
<i>Not anymore.</i>

164
00:12:51.626 --> 00:12:53.251
<i>Vera Willbond.</i>

165
00:12:54.001 --> 00:12:55.418
How do you do?

166
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:23.793
What's that?

167
00:13:23.834 --> 00:13:24.876
Secret.

168
00:13:24.918 --> 00:13:26.459
- Show me.
- No.

169
00:13:27.876 --> 00:13:29.126
What will you give me?

170
00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:32.418
- Show you up my skirt.
- No thanks.

171
00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:33.959
I wouldn't have anyway.

172
00:13:35.584 --> 00:13:37.501
- Who are you staying with?
- A lady.

173
00:13:38.043 --> 00:13:39.293
But only for a week.

174
00:13:39.334 --> 00:13:40.459
Then I have to move.

175
00:13:40.501 --> 00:13:42.293
Why?
Did you do something bad?

176
00:13:42.334 --> 00:13:43.434
No.

177
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:46.084
Still. at least you escaped.

178
00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:48.418
You're fourteen times
more likely to be blow up

179
00:13:48.459 --> 00:13:49.501
in London than anywhere.

180
00:13:49.543 --> 00:13:50.959
And even if you don't die.

181
00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:53.394
they can burn your skin off
so you don't have eyelids anymore.

182
00:13:53.418 --> 00:13:54.876
My mom's in London.

183
00:13:56.043 --> 00:13:57.293
Mine's dead.

184
00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:00.793
What about your dad?

185
00:14:00.834 --> 00:14:01.959
He's in the war.

186
00:14:02.001 --> 00:14:03.168
So is mine.

187
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:06.793
- We might be invaded soon.
- Who says?

188
00:14:06.834 --> 00:14:07.793
My grandma.

189
00:14:07.834 --> 00:14:09.126
She said they might come here.

190
00:14:09.168 --> 00:14:11.209
- Why?
- Cause no one suspects.

191
00:14:12.334 --> 00:14:13.834
Probably here already.

192
00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:18.168
Look. Spies.

193
00:14:19.334 --> 00:14:20.959
<i>They don't look like spies.</i>

194
00:14:21.084 --> 00:14:22.751
That's the whole point. stupid.

195
00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:27.293
I'll show you for a peppermint.

196
00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.543
I've only got one.

197
00:14:30.084 --> 00:14:31.334
Half?

198
00:14:46.334 --> 00:14:47.959
<i>Does anyone else live here?</i>

199
00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:49.126
No.

200
00:14:56.418 --> 00:14:58.043
Do you have any pets?

201
00:14:58.376 --> 00:15:00.126
You think I should have a cat.
don't you?

202
00:15:07.834 --> 00:15:08.793
Read them. if you like.

203
00:15:08.834 --> 00:15:09.834
No. thank you.

204
00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:11.501
Why not?

205
00:15:11.959 --> 00:15:13.418
They don't look very interesting.

206
00:15:13.459 --> 00:15:14.876
I wrote them.

207
00:15:22.126 --> 00:15:23.668
- Are they stories?
- No.

208
00:15:24.834 --> 00:15:26.376
Analysis of folklore.

209
00:15:27.084 --> 00:15:28.418
Science behind the myths.

210
00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:30.084
Visions. witches.
That sort of thing.

211
00:15:30.626 --> 00:15:32.543
Women living alone with cats.

212
00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:43.543
- That's Italy.
- What do you want. a prize?

213
00:15:45.043 --> 00:15:47.043
What do you call an Italian
with a cold?

214
00:15:49.168 --> 00:15:50.001
It's a joke.

215
00:15:50.043 --> 00:15:51.334
My mom taught me.

216
00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:54.084
- A joke?
- You say. I don't know.

217
00:15:54.126 --> 00:15:55.685
What do you call an Italian
with a cold?

218
00:15:55.709 --> 00:15:57.376
No.

219
00:15:57.418 --> 00:15:59.001
I say.
speak when you're spoken to.

220
00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:01.959
- So...
- So what?

221
00:16:02.001 --> 00:16:03.709
What do you call an Italian
with a cold?

222
00:16:03.751 --> 00:16:05.168
I don't know!

223
00:16:06.001 --> 00:16:07.459
Julius Sneezer.

224
00:16:10.043 --> 00:16:11.043
That's ridiculous.

225
00:16:11.084 --> 00:16:12.918
- It's funny.
- No. it's not.

226
00:16:13.626 --> 00:16:14.959
Actually. it's ignorant.

227
00:16:15.418 --> 00:16:17.751
Italy wasn't unified until 1861.

228
00:16:17.793 --> 00:16:19.251
So you should say.

229
00:16:19.293 --> 00:16:21.626
"What do you call a Roman
with a cold."

230
00:16:22.209 --> 00:16:23.584
Tell your mother that.

231
00:16:51.668 --> 00:16:52.918
<i>How are you getting on. son?</i>

232
00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:56.126
Not missing the bright lights.
I hope.

233
00:16:57.834 --> 00:17:00.793
Yeah. I know.
You-You have rather picked

234
00:17:00.834 --> 00:17:01.626
the bad apple.

235
00:17:01.668 --> 00:17:04.126
Got the thin end
of the wedge so to speak.

236
00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:07.501
"The beast on the beach."

237
00:17:07.543 --> 00:17:09.543
No. Forget I said that.

238
00:17:09.584 --> 00:17:11.293
I'm joking.
You'll be fine.

239
00:17:11.834 --> 00:17:15.543
It's hard leaving people
behind you.

240
00:17:15.584 --> 00:17:17.959
You just have to keep
your pecker up.

241
00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:19.293
Could be worse.

242
00:17:20.334 --> 00:17:21.501
How?

243
00:17:30.793 --> 00:17:33.543
There's adders in the woods.
poisonous ones.

244
00:17:33.584 --> 00:17:34.418
Want to come?

245
00:17:34.459 --> 00:17:35.959
No. thanks.

246
00:17:36.001 --> 00:17:37.334
You're scared.

247
00:17:37.376 --> 00:17:38.476
I'm not.

248
00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:42.334
I'm going to catch one.
trap it and make it into tea.

249
00:17:42.376 --> 00:17:44.168
in case I'm abducted
by a German.

250
00:17:44.209 --> 00:17:46.126
What if he doesn't like tea?

251
00:17:46.168 --> 00:17:47.501
Everyone likes tea.

252
00:17:48.584 --> 00:17:49.626
Where are you going?

253
00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:51.168
Back to where I'm staying.

254
00:17:51.209 --> 00:17:52.459
No one lives up there.

255
00:17:53.376 --> 00:17:54.668
Except the witch.

256
00:17:54.709 --> 00:17:56.168
What witch?

257
00:17:56.334 --> 00:17:57.501
Race you.

258
00:18:02.668 --> 00:18:04.168
That's her.

259
00:18:08.626 --> 00:18:10.709
- Do you live with her?
- Yes.

260
00:18:11.084 --> 00:18:12.418
She's mad.

261
00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:13.709
Says who?

262
00:18:13.751 --> 00:18:16.043
Says my grandma.
And everyone.

263
00:18:16.543 --> 00:18:18.501
She sends signals to the Nazis.

264
00:18:18.543 --> 00:18:21.293
No. she doesn't.
She writes books.

265
00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:22.376
Spells.

266
00:18:22.418 --> 00:18:24.126
No.
Folklore and stuff.

267
00:18:24.168 --> 00:18:25.501
She'll make you her slave.

268
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:27.834
They all have them.

269
00:18:28.084 --> 00:18:30.209
They make you work
till you're all bones.

270
00:18:30.793 --> 00:18:32.393
Then when you're worn out.
they burn you.

271
00:18:32.418 --> 00:18:33.959
or do sex things to you.

272
00:18:36.251 --> 00:18:37.876
She won't.

273
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:43.418
They'll never find your body!

274
00:18:57.668 --> 00:18:59.418
- Is that King Arthur?
- No.

275
00:19:00.376 --> 00:19:01.959
It's Morgan Le Fay.

276
00:19:02.001 --> 00:19:03.376
She was a sorceress.

277
00:19:06.334 --> 00:19:08.584
What's Fata Morgana?

278
00:19:08.626 --> 00:19:10.626
I thought you were
digging potatoes.

279
00:19:10.668 --> 00:19:12.543
They won't dig themselves.

280
00:19:16.709 --> 00:19:18.209
It's a myth.

281
00:19:19.043 --> 00:19:21.959
About how she lured sailors
to their deaths.

282
00:19:22.001 --> 00:19:23.209
How?

283
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:26.084
With visions of floating islands.

284
00:19:26.959 --> 00:19:29.001
They say she'd conjure them up

285
00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:31.168
to make sailors steer off course.

286
00:19:31.209 --> 00:19:33.459
crash their boats and drown.

287
00:19:33.501 --> 00:19:34.959
Why?

288
00:19:35.001 --> 00:19:38.209
Because she's a woman
in folklore.

289
00:19:38.251 --> 00:19:40.709
ergo a temptress or a virgin.

290
00:19:40.751 --> 00:19:42.626
She's bound to get blamed
for something.

291
00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:49.668
But it isn't just Fata Morgana.

292
00:19:50.918 --> 00:19:54.001
There's all sorts of myths about
islands floating in the sky.

293
00:19:54.043 --> 00:19:55.293
Why?

294
00:19:55.334 --> 00:19:57.334
People like to have something
to believe in.

295
00:19:57.376 --> 00:19:59.501
It's what everyone wants. magic.

296
00:20:00.293 --> 00:20:01.543
Or God.

297
00:20:02.084 --> 00:20:03.209
Or something.

298
00:20:04.626 --> 00:20:06.334
Hokum. all of it.

299
00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:10.501
But people must have
seen something.

300
00:20:18.251 --> 00:20:20.293
Stories have to come
from somewhere.

301
00:20:26.501 --> 00:20:28.126
Ha-he-ha-he...

302
00:20:55.043 --> 00:20:56.543
<i>Oi! Nazi witch!</i>

303
00:20:56.584 --> 00:20:57.709
<i>You're a witch.</i>

304
00:20:57.751 --> 00:20:59.334
- Hey!
<i>- Spy!</i>

305
00:20:59.834 --> 00:21:00.934
<i>- Nazi spy!</i>
- Hey! I t...

306
00:21:00.959 --> 00:21:03.501
<i>- You'll burn witch.</i>
- Hey! I told you...

307
00:21:03.543 --> 00:21:04.751
- Clear off!
<i>- Nazi!</i>

308
00:21:04.793 --> 00:21:06.084
Get out!

309
00:21:07.418 --> 00:21:08.293
Frank!

310
00:21:08.334 --> 00:21:12.126
<i>- You're a Nazi!</i>
- Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

311
00:21:19.126 --> 00:21:21.334
Hold still.
I've got things to do.

312
00:21:22.126 --> 00:21:23.168
Frank.

313
00:21:23.209 --> 00:21:24.709
Are you a Nazi?

314
00:21:25.959 --> 00:21:27.251
Yes. I'm a Nazi.

315
00:21:27.293 --> 00:21:29.834
I'm going to murder you
in your bed.

316
00:21:30.376 --> 00:21:32.834
Course I'm not a Nazi.
Now. come here.

317
00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:35.543
Will it sting?

318
00:21:35.584 --> 00:21:37.709
Hey. you'll have to toughen up.

319
00:21:37.751 --> 00:21:39.626
You want them to think
you're a coward?

320
00:21:57.418 --> 00:21:59.376
Why did they do it?

321
00:21:59.834 --> 00:22:01.834
They've nothing better to do.

322
00:22:02.876 --> 00:22:04.751
Probably think it's funny.

323
00:22:04.793 --> 00:22:06.918
a woman living here on her own.

324
00:22:09.793 --> 00:22:11.626
Why do you?

325
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.668
I suppose it's just the way
it worked out.

326
00:22:20.126 --> 00:22:21.959
Empty that before you spill it.

327
00:22:34.376 --> 00:22:35.918
<i>Vera Willbond.</i>

328
00:22:37.418 --> 00:22:38.751
<i>How do you do?</i>

329
00:22:46.043 --> 00:22:48.543
<i>Alice?
As in Wonderland?</i>

330
00:22:48.918 --> 00:22:50.376
<i>No.</i>

331
00:22:50.418 --> 00:22:53.334
<i>After Alice Evans.
Micro biologist.</i>

332
00:22:53.376 --> 00:22:54.834
My father's idea.

333
00:22:54.876 --> 00:22:57.418
Oh.
Is he a scientist?

334
00:22:58.209 --> 00:22:59.793
He was.

335
00:23:00.876 --> 00:23:01.976
I'm sorry.

336
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:04.668
It's alright.

337
00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.959
It's not. though. is it?

338
00:23:10.126 --> 00:23:11.751
Presumably.

339
00:23:13.918 --> 00:23:15.043
No.

340
00:23:16.668 --> 00:23:18.126
Not really.

341
00:23:19.209 --> 00:23:20.834
Not really at all.

342
00:23:25.543 --> 00:23:28.459
Well. here we are.

343
00:23:29.459 --> 00:23:31.543
So I say. make the most of it.

344
00:23:33.126 --> 00:23:34.376
<i>What do you do?</i>

345
00:23:34.418 --> 00:23:36.209
<i>I'm a history student.</i>

346
00:23:36.251 --> 00:23:37.351
<i>You?</i>

347
00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:39.876
<i>Modern languages. officially.</i>

348
00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:42.293
But truth is.
I'm writing a novel.

349
00:23:42.334 --> 00:23:43.434
Don't tell.

350
00:23:44.126 --> 00:23:45.668
I love this.

351
00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:48.918
Let's talk afterwards.

352
00:23:48.959 --> 00:23:50.876
I know just the place we can go.

353
00:24:11.626 --> 00:24:13.668
♪♪

354
00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:16.293
You'll fall over.

355
00:25:29.668 --> 00:25:31.418
I can't make the wings stay on.

356
00:25:31.459 --> 00:25:33.584
You think it's fun
to play games about war?

357
00:25:33.626 --> 00:25:34.918
I'm not.

358
00:25:44.918 --> 00:25:46.126
They're too heavy.

359
00:25:47.584 --> 00:25:48.684
If you insist on doing it

360
00:25:48.709 --> 00:25:50.793
you might at least
do it properly.

361
00:25:51.084 --> 00:25:52.918
You need balsa wood or cedar.

362
00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:54.793
Go and look in the drift.

363
00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:26.309
Is this for your book?

364
00:26:31.876 --> 00:26:33.709
You... Youghal...

365
00:26:33.751 --> 00:26:35.418
Youghal Bay.

366
00:26:38.626 --> 00:26:39.793
What are they?

367
00:26:39.834 --> 00:26:40.934
Sitings.

368
00:26:41.751 --> 00:26:43.209
Nineteen-sixteen.

369
00:26:43.251 --> 00:26:45.168
a painter says he sees an island

370
00:26:45.209 --> 00:26:46.501
rise out of the sea.

371
00:26:46.543 --> 00:26:48.168
The papers say it's a submarine.

372
00:26:48.751 --> 00:26:50.251
- It's got trees on it.
- Yes.

373
00:26:50.293 --> 00:26:51.751
Look at the coastlines.

374
00:26:52.334 --> 00:26:53.459
- Er...
- Reggio.

375
00:26:53.501 --> 00:26:54.918
Reggio...

376
00:26:55.418 --> 00:26:56.293
Youghal Bay.

377
00:26:56.334 --> 00:26:58.001
Youghal...

378
00:26:58.459 --> 00:26:59.626
They're the same shape.

379
00:27:02.376 --> 00:27:04.209
Now. look at this.

380
00:27:05.376 --> 00:27:07.543
We're here. near Ramsgate.

381
00:27:11.293 --> 00:27:13.001
Notice anything?

382
00:27:14.043 --> 00:27:15.584
It's the same. too.

383
00:27:16.709 --> 00:27:18.209
Look.
Read this.

384
00:27:21.918 --> 00:27:25.459
"The cliffs between Dover
and Ramsgate incer..."

385
00:27:25.501 --> 00:27:26.459
Intercept.

386
00:27:26.501 --> 00:27:29.251
"...intercept the view
of Dover Castle."

387
00:27:29.293 --> 00:27:30.584
Yet the people of Ramsgate

388
00:27:30.626 --> 00:27:33.751
saw Dover Castle
floating above the sea.

389
00:27:35.418 --> 00:27:36.518
Proof.

390
00:27:37.418 --> 00:27:39.543
Floating islands.
Here.

391
00:27:41.418 --> 00:27:42.209
Where are you going?

392
00:27:42.251 --> 00:27:43.543
To see it for myself.

393
00:27:43.793 --> 00:27:44.893
Where?

394
00:27:46.251 --> 00:27:47.351
Ramsgate.

395
00:27:48.834 --> 00:27:49.668
Can I come?

396
00:27:49.709 --> 00:27:51.293
- No!
- Please?

397
00:28:08.251 --> 00:28:10.793
That's where they saw it.
There.

398
00:28:21.334 --> 00:28:22.459
What happens now?

399
00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:24.168
We wait.

400
00:28:24.209 --> 00:28:26.501
For what?
Magic?

401
00:28:27.334 --> 00:28:28.459
Science.

402
00:28:29.543 --> 00:28:30.959
Proof.

403
00:28:37.168 --> 00:28:39.001
Have you ever been in a plane?

404
00:28:39.043 --> 00:28:40.293
No chance.

405
00:28:40.334 --> 00:28:41.434
Are you scared?

406
00:28:41.459 --> 00:28:43.376
Do you always ask
mindless questions?

407
00:28:47.209 --> 00:28:48.309
Have you?

408
00:28:48.334 --> 00:28:50.376
Yep. with my pa.

409
00:28:50.543 --> 00:28:51.643
What's it like?

410
00:28:56.418 --> 00:28:57.334
Really loud.

411
00:28:57.376 --> 00:28:59.668
and sometimes
I couldn't breathe.

412
00:28:59.709 --> 00:29:01.043
Weren't you scared?

413
00:29:01.084 --> 00:29:02.959
Only when they shot at us.

414
00:29:05.626 --> 00:29:07.418
Why are you lying?

415
00:29:07.459 --> 00:29:08.584
I'm not.

416
00:29:10.376 --> 00:29:11.959
Look. there!

417
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:13.209
- Where? What?
- Right there!

418
00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:14.251
Below the big cloud.

419
00:29:14.293 --> 00:29:15.644
You're not looking
where I'm looking.

420
00:29:15.668 --> 00:29:16.709
- W-where?
- It's there.

421
00:29:16.751 --> 00:29:18.251
- Look. It's a tower.
- Where?

422
00:29:18.293 --> 00:29:19.709
It's. it's there.
It's a tower.

423
00:29:19.751 --> 00:29:21.418
- I can't see.
- On a floating island.

424
00:29:21.459 --> 00:29:23.459
With a green flag on it.
on a turret.

425
00:29:23.501 --> 00:29:25.709
Look.
A green flag on a turret.

426
00:29:25.751 --> 00:29:27.001
Look.
Right there.

427
00:29:29.751 --> 00:29:31.543
Do you think this is a game?!

428
00:29:33.626 --> 00:29:35.459
This is my work.

429
00:29:35.501 --> 00:29:37.709
Dover Castle doesn't fly flags.

430
00:29:37.751 --> 00:29:39.751
I saw it.
A green flag on a turret.

431
00:29:39.793 --> 00:29:41.144
- I'm not lying.
- You're not taking this seriously.

432
00:29:41.168 --> 00:29:42.560
- Where are you going?
- We're going home.

433
00:29:42.584 --> 00:29:44.709
- It's not my home!
- Well. stay here. then.

434
00:29:44.751 --> 00:29:45.959
See if I care.

435
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:56.459
Frank?

436
00:31:09.418 --> 00:31:10.709
Frank!

437
00:31:11.709 --> 00:31:13.168
You really saw it.

438
00:31:17.959 --> 00:31:19.501
I'm sorry. Frank.

439
00:31:55.584 --> 00:31:56.684
What are you doing?

440
00:31:56.709 --> 00:31:57.668
It's broken.

441
00:31:57.709 --> 00:32:00.584
Well. what do you think
we should do about that then?

442
00:32:34.668 --> 00:32:36.251
What if it breaks?

443
00:32:37.334 --> 00:32:39.668
Alright. listen to me.

444
00:32:40.334 --> 00:32:42.126
Life is not kind.

445
00:32:43.043 --> 00:32:44.626
Anguish is inevitable.

446
00:32:46.084 --> 00:32:47.501
Your heart will break.

447
00:32:48.168 --> 00:32:49.501
Your friends will die.

448
00:32:50.876 --> 00:32:52.709
You may even think
about killing yourself.

449
00:32:54.834 --> 00:32:56.376
Planes crash. Frank.

450
00:32:57.043 --> 00:32:59.918
What matters is how
you deal with it.

451
00:33:02.209 --> 00:33:03.626
What if it crashes?

452
00:33:04.918 --> 00:33:06.751
What if it crashes?

453
00:33:08.668 --> 00:33:10.168
I'll build another one.

454
00:33:11.834 --> 00:33:13.084
Well then...

455
00:33:14.043 --> 00:33:15.459
what are you waiting for?

456
00:33:21.793 --> 00:33:22.959
Frank!

457
00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:40.918
Worth it?

458
00:33:41.251 --> 00:33:42.459
Yeah?

459
00:33:45.209 --> 00:33:46.834
Why didn't you have a husband?

460
00:33:47.001 --> 00:33:48.709
Why don't you have a wife?

461
00:33:50.543 --> 00:33:52.209
You think I need a husband?

462
00:33:52.626 --> 00:33:54.293
Did you ever have one?

463
00:33:54.751 --> 00:33:57.543
There was someone once.

464
00:33:57.709 --> 00:33:58.876
Who?

465
00:33:59.084 --> 00:34:00.543
It's in the past now.

466
00:34:03.584 --> 00:34:05.209
- Did you get married?
- No.

467
00:34:05.626 --> 00:34:06.334
Why not?

468
00:34:06.376 --> 00:34:08.251
What is this. twenty questions?

469
00:34:10.793 --> 00:34:12.043
Can we have chips for dinner?

470
00:34:12.084 --> 00:34:14.126
You always want chips.

471
00:34:14.501 --> 00:34:16.185
Thank God I've only got you
for a few more days

472
00:34:16.209 --> 00:34:18.126
or I'd probably starve to death.

473
00:34:31.959 --> 00:34:33.918
<i>- You'll miss the turn in.
- Who cares.</i>

474
00:34:33.959 --> 00:34:36.501
- I like this road.
- I care. Vee.

475
00:34:36.543 --> 00:34:38.543
I quite like to get there
in one piece...

476
00:34:38.584 --> 00:34:40.709
♪ <i>Where's that blue room</i>

There's the turn in!

482
00:34:59.501 --> 00:35:01.043
Look at the lake.

483
00:35:01.793 --> 00:35:03.293
Where are you taking me?

484
00:35:41.459 --> 00:35:43.084
<i>I like your feet.</i>

485
00:35:43.418 --> 00:35:44.459
<i>My feet?</i>

486
00:35:44.501 --> 00:35:45.876
Why are you looking at my feet?

487
00:35:45.918 --> 00:35:47.543
They're a nice shape.

488
00:35:48.043 --> 00:35:50.751
Why don't you paint your toes?

489
00:35:50.918 --> 00:35:51.834
Why would I?

490
00:35:51.876 --> 00:35:53.668
Because they're old and crusty.

491
00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:56.751
And you might want to look nice.

492
00:35:56.793 --> 00:35:58.418
like a normal person.

493
00:35:59.751 --> 00:36:00.751
That's it.

494
00:36:00.793 --> 00:36:02.043
Don't go in.

495
00:36:02.459 --> 00:36:03.626
Stay.

496
00:36:17.584 --> 00:36:18.959
Do you miss him?

497
00:36:22.668 --> 00:36:24.334
You are allowed to.

498
00:36:26.043 --> 00:36:27.501
He was your father.

499
00:36:43.126 --> 00:36:45.126
I think you're remarkable...

500
00:36:48.376 --> 00:36:49.918
to get by...

501
00:36:51.293 --> 00:36:52.918
with no one.

502
00:36:55.418 --> 00:36:57.043
Not no one now.

503
00:37:20.418 --> 00:37:21.876
You saw a fish?

504
00:37:22.793 --> 00:37:23.959
It's right here.

505
00:37:27.168 --> 00:37:28.334
Hello.

506
00:37:29.668 --> 00:37:31.334
You're a friend from school?

507
00:37:31.376 --> 00:37:32.918
This is Edie.

508
00:37:32.959 --> 00:37:34.059
Hello. Edie.

509
00:37:36.334 --> 00:37:37.543
There's a letter for you.

510
00:37:38.043 --> 00:37:39.143
Is there?

511
00:37:39.334 --> 00:37:40.459
Do you want to come in?

512
00:37:40.501 --> 00:37:41.834
You're joking.

513
00:37:43.876 --> 00:37:45.334
See you.

514
00:37:46.334 --> 00:37:47.168
Where is it?

515
00:37:47.209 --> 00:37:48.543
On the table.

516
00:37:53.584 --> 00:37:54.876
<i>Any news?</i>

517
00:37:54.918 --> 00:37:56.168
Dad's got a new plane.

518
00:37:56.209 --> 00:37:57.793
It's called a Lockheed Ventura.

519
00:37:57.834 --> 00:38:00.334
It's got twin engines
and it's blue.

520
00:38:00.876 --> 00:38:02.168
And your mother?

521
00:38:02.209 --> 00:38:04.376
She's got a job
talking to Ministers.

522
00:38:04.418 --> 00:38:05.251
Ministers?

523
00:38:05.293 --> 00:38:06.709
Doing what?

524
00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:10.543
Doesn't say.
It's 'cause of the war.

525
00:38:10.709 --> 00:38:12.001
You should write back.

526
00:38:35.876 --> 00:38:37.334
Put this in. too.

527
00:38:37.376 --> 00:38:38.668
What is it?

528
00:38:38.709 --> 00:38:42.043
It says I'm sending you back.
you're a pain in my side.

529
00:38:44.418 --> 00:38:45.959
It's alright.

530
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:48.251
Couple more days.
you'll be gone anyway.

531
00:38:49.876 --> 00:38:51.043
Where will I go?

532
00:38:51.084 --> 00:38:53.376
With a family from school.
I expect.

533
00:38:53.418 --> 00:38:54.584
Much more fun.

534
00:38:55.918 --> 00:38:57.376
Can I stay here?

535
00:39:01.084 --> 00:39:03.043
I told you. I have to work.

536
00:39:03.584 --> 00:39:05.876
Blessed chance of that
with you around.

537
00:39:11.626 --> 00:39:12.501
Come on.

538
00:39:12.543 --> 00:39:13.834
We'll post it on the way.

539
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:15.626
Where are we going?

540
00:39:16.043 --> 00:39:17.501
Turret hunting.

541
00:39:33.376 --> 00:39:36.709
<i>The floating islands in the clouds.
is that like heaven?</i>

542
00:39:36.751 --> 00:39:40.376
<i>No. it's physics.
Some sort of mirage.</i>

543
00:39:41.251 --> 00:39:42.709
<i>Do you believe in heaven?</i>

544
00:39:42.751 --> 00:39:43.709
<i>Yes.</i>

545
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:44.918
<i>Well. you shouldn't.</i>

546
00:39:44.959 --> 00:39:46.418
It's just made up
by the Christians

547
00:39:46.459 --> 00:39:48.209
to make themselves feel better.

548
00:39:48.459 --> 00:39:49.626
How do you know?

549
00:39:49.668 --> 00:39:51.501
Because if it was true.

550
00:39:52.334 --> 00:39:55.543
what happened to all the people
who died before the Christians?

551
00:39:55.584 --> 00:39:57.293
Where did their souls go?

552
00:39:58.543 --> 00:40:00.084
Summerland.

553
00:40:00.126 --> 00:40:01.126
Where?

554
00:40:01.168 --> 00:40:02.293
Summerland.

555
00:40:02.334 --> 00:40:04.084
Come on.
I know a short cut.

556
00:40:08.209 --> 00:40:09.501
Where's Summerland?

557
00:40:10.543 --> 00:40:12.168
Here.

558
00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:13.584
In Kent?

559
00:40:13.626 --> 00:40:16.543
No.
All around us.

560
00:40:17.418 --> 00:40:19.918
Like a layer that we can't see.

561
00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:23.001
until it gets disturbed
by a restless soul

562
00:40:23.043 --> 00:40:25.168
that's trying to tell us something.

563
00:40:25.209 --> 00:40:27.043
- How?
- How do you think?

564
00:40:27.959 --> 00:40:29.626
By disturbing the patterns.

565
00:40:32.376 --> 00:40:33.476
Look.

566
00:40:35.376 --> 00:40:37.043
<i>Patterns in the clouds.</i>

567
00:40:37.793 --> 00:40:39.709
<i>Pagans thought they were signs.</i>

568
00:40:40.501 --> 00:40:41.601
<i>From Summerland.</i>

569
00:40:42.793 --> 00:40:44.376
<i>Magic.</i>

570
00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:47.001
I thought you didn't
believe in magic.

571
00:40:47.043 --> 00:40:48.143
I don't.

572
00:40:49.209 --> 00:40:50.959
Stories have to come
from somewhere.

573
00:40:56.293 --> 00:40:58.751
<i>In the myth about Morgan Le Fay.</i>

574
00:40:58.793 --> 00:41:00.834
do you think that's what
the sailors saw?

575
00:41:00.876 --> 00:41:02.084
What?

576
00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:03.226
Summerland.

577
00:41:03.626 --> 00:41:06.043
If it's invisible except sometimes.

578
00:41:06.876 --> 00:41:08.334
like the island.

579
00:41:08.626 --> 00:41:10.793
They're completely different ideas.

580
00:41:10.834 --> 00:41:13.501
Summerland's pagan.
Fata Morgana's a myth.

581
00:41:13.959 --> 00:41:15.293
Could be the same.

582
00:41:15.334 --> 00:41:17.751
If it's dead people
making a sign.

583
00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:21.876
maybe Summerland is the island.

584
00:41:22.876 --> 00:41:24.084
None of it's real.

585
00:41:25.668 --> 00:41:27.668
<i>The islands are mirages</i>

586
00:41:27.709 --> 00:41:29.793
<i>and Summerland's just
a pagan heaven.</i>

587
00:41:30.376 --> 00:41:32.001
<i>How do you know?</i>

588
00:41:32.043 --> 00:41:33.876
<i>Just because you haven't seen it?</i>

589
00:41:44.084 --> 00:41:46.043
Can I have her now?
It's my turn.

590
00:41:46.084 --> 00:41:47.626
I haven't had long enough.

591
00:41:47.668 --> 00:41:48.834
Please.

592
00:41:51.168 --> 00:41:52.584
What is that?

593
00:41:52.626 --> 00:41:53.668
This is Molly.

594
00:41:53.709 --> 00:41:55.126
She's our rat.

595
00:41:55.168 --> 00:41:56.918
We take it in turns
to look after her.

596
00:41:56.959 --> 00:41:58.209
She's not coming inside.

597
00:41:58.251 --> 00:41:59.351
She'll stay in my pocket.

598
00:41:59.376 --> 00:42:01.501
What happened to your shoe?

599
00:42:01.543 --> 00:42:03.501
- Edie slipped on the rocks.
- No. I didn't.

600
00:42:03.543 --> 00:42:05.126
- We'd better clean it up.
- No!

601
00:42:05.168 --> 00:42:06.626
You don't want an infection.

602
00:42:12.584 --> 00:42:14.293
This might sting a bit.

603
00:42:19.876 --> 00:42:20.976
All done.

604
00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:23.293
Better?

605
00:42:24.126 --> 00:42:25.251
Yes.

606
00:42:25.834 --> 00:42:27.376
Do you want to stay for dinner?

607
00:42:27.834 --> 00:42:30.251
It's Frank's last night.
so I'm celebrating.

608
00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:35.584
- I'm not allowed.
- Oh?

609
00:42:40.584 --> 00:42:43.626
Well. then. another time.

610
00:43:12.251 --> 00:43:13.709
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

611
00:43:14.168 --> 00:43:15.501
Sorry.

612
00:43:53.584 --> 00:43:55.084
Can we put some music on?

613
00:44:00.001 --> 00:44:00.918
Put it back.

614
00:44:00.959 --> 00:44:02.751
- What is it?
- Put it back!

615
00:44:10.709 --> 00:44:11.876
Hand me your plate.

616
00:44:19.459 --> 00:44:20.668
Sorry.

617
00:44:22.543 --> 00:44:24.209
It's just...

618
00:44:24.876 --> 00:44:26.334
it was a gift. that's all.

619
00:44:27.668 --> 00:44:28.768
From who?

620
00:44:31.626 --> 00:44:32.726
A lady.

621
00:44:33.459 --> 00:44:34.559
A friend.

622
00:44:35.584 --> 00:44:37.251
It's a good tune.

623
00:44:38.293 --> 00:44:39.918
Was she the one you loved?

624
00:44:42.751 --> 00:44:44.043
Why d'you say that?

625
00:44:52.084 --> 00:44:54.334
Would you think it was strange...

626
00:44:56.751 --> 00:44:58.959
if a woman loved another woman?

627
00:45:03.793 --> 00:45:04.893
No.

628
00:45:12.418 --> 00:45:13.518
Sorry.

629
00:45:14.334 --> 00:45:16.959
It's not you.
You didn't do...

630
00:45:17.001 --> 00:45:18.959
It's just...

631
00:45:21.168 --> 00:45:23.168
most people think it's wicked.

632
00:45:25.251 --> 00:45:26.351
Why?

633
00:45:31.126 --> 00:45:32.376
I don't know.

634
00:45:35.626 --> 00:45:36.959
They think it's a sin.

635
00:45:39.126 --> 00:45:40.751
To love someone.

636
00:45:43.418 --> 00:45:45.543
That we should burn in hell.

637
00:45:48.334 --> 00:45:51.251
It's not as bad as marrying
somebody you don't like.

638
00:45:57.334 --> 00:45:59.959
Do they argue?
At home?

639
00:46:01.834 --> 00:46:02.934
Sometimes.

640
00:46:04.043 --> 00:46:05.959
Sometimes they just go quiet.

641
00:46:10.001 --> 00:46:11.418
Did you kiss her?

642
00:46:15.001 --> 00:46:17.084
How would you feel
if I said yes?

643
00:46:17.876 --> 00:46:19.126
Don't know.

644
00:46:19.376 --> 00:46:22.043
Then yes.
How was that?

645
00:46:22.668 --> 00:46:24.043
Alright.

646
00:46:24.084 --> 00:46:25.543
Was it on the lips?

647
00:46:26.793 --> 00:46:28.251
Mostly.

648
00:46:28.293 --> 00:46:29.251
Eat up.

649
00:46:29.293 --> 00:46:30.959
Your stew's getting cold.

650
00:46:37.584 --> 00:46:39.209
Tell me how to make your bed.

651
00:46:40.084 --> 00:46:41.959
- Top two corners.
- Then?

652
00:46:42.876 --> 00:46:45.126
The bottom. and then the other.

653
00:46:45.584 --> 00:46:48.459
And make sure you put
the pots away.

654
00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:50.959
And write to your mother.

655
00:46:51.876 --> 00:46:53.376
Always help with the washing-up.

656
00:46:53.418 --> 00:46:54.918
And?

657
00:46:54.959 --> 00:46:56.709
Don't always ask for chips.

658
00:47:03.001 --> 00:47:04.251
Ready for the big day?

659
00:47:05.126 --> 00:47:06.793
Good news. my boy.

660
00:47:06.834 --> 00:47:08.251
We've found you a family.

661
00:47:08.543 --> 00:47:11.626
Decent enough people.
They're. er. er. retired.

662
00:47:11.668 --> 00:47:13.459
They. they live just
up the coast.

663
00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:16.918
And there's a place for you at St Joseph's.
What?

664
00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:18.918
It's not a bad school at all.

665
00:47:18.959 --> 00:47:20.144
I don't want to move school.

666
00:47:20.168 --> 00:47:21.668
Surely you can keep him here.

667
00:47:21.709 --> 00:47:24.501
Well. he can't go to school here
if he doesn't live here.

668
00:47:24.876 --> 00:47:27.293
This isn't what you said.
Why did you lie?!

669
00:47:27.334 --> 00:47:28.918
I didn't know.
Frank!

670
00:47:29.876 --> 00:47:31.251
Frank!

671
00:47:37.543 --> 00:47:39.001
Be good.

672
00:48:10.418 --> 00:48:12.168
Very serious. dear.

673
00:48:12.209 --> 00:48:13.959
Do I look stern?

674
00:48:14.293 --> 00:48:15.751
<i>Go on.</i>

675
00:48:15.793 --> 00:48:18.376
<i>What do the stars have in store.
Madame Lamb?</i>

676
00:48:19.459 --> 00:48:20.918
A long life.

677
00:48:22.001 --> 00:48:23.293
Good health.

678
00:48:24.584 --> 00:48:27.459
You meet a delectable woman
at twenty-two

679
00:48:27.501 --> 00:48:28.876
and never look back again.

680
00:48:30.418 --> 00:48:32.334
And this line?

681
00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:35.168
Ah. that line says you
ought to use cold cream.

682
00:48:38.001 --> 00:48:39.418
And this one?

683
00:48:39.959 --> 00:48:42.834
You are destined to be
a fine novelist.

684
00:48:42.876 --> 00:48:45.459
but first you have to finish
your book.

685
00:48:49.084 --> 00:48:50.668
What else does my palm say?

686
00:48:50.709 --> 00:48:51.918
That's it.

687
00:49:00.709 --> 00:49:02.376
What about family?

688
00:49:03.918 --> 00:49:05.168
Can't tell.

689
00:49:11.209 --> 00:49:12.543
Al.

690
00:49:14.209 --> 00:49:15.584
Why won't you talk about this?

691
00:49:15.626 --> 00:49:17.918
- Vee...
- We need to talk about this.

692
00:49:22.043 --> 00:49:23.376
I want a family.

693
00:49:26.084 --> 00:49:28.251
What if I want to be a mother?

694
00:50:09.376 --> 00:50:11.001
Aren't you gonna come and play?

695
00:50:19.626 --> 00:50:21.876
Ready to meet your new family?

696
00:50:33.084 --> 00:50:35.376
You'll have to be on your
very best behavior.

697
00:50:35.418 --> 00:50:36.918
We can't be finding you
a new set

698
00:50:36.959 --> 00:50:39.376
when this lot
give you the heave-ho.

699
00:50:39.418 --> 00:50:41.293
I'm joking.
Come on.

700
00:50:46.709 --> 00:50:49.418
You know I'll give you straight back
if you misbehave.

701
00:50:53.376 --> 00:50:55.543
Go on. then.
It's yours.

702
00:51:00.001 --> 00:51:01.101
What is it?

703
00:51:05.834 --> 00:51:07.793
Why did you say I couldn't stay?

704
00:51:09.334 --> 00:51:10.918
That you didn't want me?

705
00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:12.918
I changed my mind.

706
00:51:15.043 --> 00:51:16.293
I'm sorry.

707
00:51:16.876 --> 00:51:17.976
Frank.

708
00:51:19.001 --> 00:51:20.459
It's the truth.

709
00:51:21.418 --> 00:51:23.043
I wouldn't lie to you.

710
00:51:25.209 --> 00:51:26.543
Promise?

711
00:51:27.334 --> 00:51:28.584
I promise.

712
00:51:31.209 --> 00:51:33.668
Mr Sullivan said
it's your birthday tomorrow.

713
00:51:33.709 --> 00:51:34.809
Can we have cake?

714
00:51:34.834 --> 00:51:36.001
We'll see.

715
00:51:37.626 --> 00:51:39.043
I'm hunting scrap iron.

716
00:51:39.084 --> 00:51:41.751
Mr Sullivan said they'd give us
a penny for every box.

717
00:51:41.793 --> 00:51:42.918
Wanna come?

718
00:51:42.959 --> 00:51:44.668
- Can I?
- Go on.

719
00:51:46.584 --> 00:51:48.376
Be back before it's dark.

720
00:52:02.168 --> 00:52:04.543
Look what I found.

721
00:52:05.209 --> 00:52:06.584
We'll get a penny for that.

722
00:52:12.334 --> 00:52:13.501
I might run away soon.

723
00:52:14.209 --> 00:52:15.709
My grandma's getting an evacuee.

724
00:52:15.751 --> 00:52:16.793
Might be good.

725
00:52:16.834 --> 00:52:18.376
No.
They're only getting her

726
00:52:18.418 --> 00:52:20.376
because I'm
an inadequate offspring.

727
00:52:21.001 --> 00:52:22.126
Says who?

728
00:52:22.668 --> 00:52:24.084
I read about it.

729
00:52:24.126 --> 00:52:27.126
They're compensating because
I don't fulfill the feminine ideal.

730
00:52:27.168 --> 00:52:28.418
like Mum did.

731
00:52:28.459 --> 00:52:30.209
I know.
'cause they ordered a girl.

732
00:52:30.251 --> 00:52:32.084
She'll probably like ballet
and everything.

733
00:52:32.876 --> 00:52:35.043
I'm glad you don't like ballet.

734
00:52:35.084 --> 00:52:36.626
You don't fancy me. do you?

735
00:52:36.668 --> 00:52:37.768
No.

736
00:52:38.834 --> 00:52:40.126
Bombers up.

737
00:52:49.793 --> 00:52:51.793
No. I don't want another one.

738
00:52:51.834 --> 00:52:52.934
Is Frank here?

739
00:52:52.959 --> 00:52:54.126
He's out with Edie.

740
00:52:54.168 --> 00:52:55.334
I need to speak to him.

741
00:52:55.376 --> 00:52:57.668
What is it?
I can tell him when he gets back.

742
00:52:59.126 --> 00:53:00.418
What is it?

743
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:04.126
His father.

744
00:53:06.626 --> 00:53:08.001
His father?

745
00:53:13.084 --> 00:53:14.709
We just had the telegram.

746
00:53:16.418 --> 00:53:18.126
Poor fellow...

747
00:53:34.126 --> 00:53:35.668
...having to bear it on his own.

748
00:53:35.709 --> 00:53:36.959
He's not on his own.

749
00:53:37.668 --> 00:53:39.209
You'll have to tell him.

750
00:53:40.293 --> 00:53:41.393
Me?

751
00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:43.168
I can't stay here all night.

752
00:53:43.834 --> 00:53:45.209
I-uh...

753
00:53:45.251 --> 00:53:46.793
His mother.
She should tell him.

754
00:53:46.834 --> 00:53:47.935
And we've been trying
to contact her

755
00:53:47.959 --> 00:53:49.185
but she's been working
for the Ministry.

756
00:53:49.209 --> 00:53:50.709
They're not likely
to release her.

757
00:53:50.751 --> 00:53:51.751
What if she telephoned?

758
00:53:51.793 --> 00:53:53.001
Telephoned?

759
00:53:53.626 --> 00:53:54.876
He's a child. Ms. Lamb.

760
00:53:54.918 --> 00:53:57.584
He has to be told properly.
face to face.

761
00:53:57.668 --> 00:53:59.001
And looked after.

762
00:53:59.918 --> 00:54:00.668
You tell him.

763
00:54:00.709 --> 00:54:02.168
It's his birthday tomorrow.

764
00:54:02.209 --> 00:54:04.168
- I can't tell him.
- Then do it tonight.

765
00:54:41.043 --> 00:54:42.376
Guess what I've got?

766
00:54:43.751 --> 00:54:45.043
Go on.

767
00:54:45.209 --> 00:54:46.501
Guess.

768
00:54:46.626 --> 00:54:47.726
What?

769
00:54:48.126 --> 00:54:50.418
It's bacon.
from Mrs. Bassett.

770
00:54:50.959 --> 00:54:53.668
I think it's because
she felt sorry for me.

771
00:54:53.709 --> 00:54:55.209
because I'm staying with you.

772
00:54:55.918 --> 00:54:57.543
She doesn't know
I want to though.

773
00:54:59.918 --> 00:55:01.501
<i>Can we make sandwiches...</i>

774
00:55:05.418 --> 00:55:06.793
and chips?

775
00:55:07.459 --> 00:55:08.584
Yes.

776
00:55:20.209 --> 00:55:21.959
Please may I have
a birthday party?

777
00:55:23.293 --> 00:55:24.668
Edie could come.

778
00:55:25.834 --> 00:55:27.084
And you and me.

779
00:55:28.709 --> 00:55:29.959
Frank.

780
00:55:36.543 --> 00:55:38.251
Do you think I could get
a bicycle?

781
00:55:40.626 --> 00:55:42.126
Edie has one.

782
00:56:29.543 --> 00:56:30.876
Look what I've got.

783
00:56:30.918 --> 00:56:32.918
All the way from...

784
00:56:44.793 --> 00:56:46.084
What are you doing?

785
00:56:46.459 --> 00:56:47.918
You said you'd give me time.

786
00:56:47.959 --> 00:56:49.626
I tried to say
but you wouldn't listen.

787
00:56:49.668 --> 00:56:52.668
- But I love you and we--
- What?

788
00:56:54.209 --> 00:56:56.293
What can we ever be?

789
00:56:57.793 --> 00:57:00.918
Two spinsters who can
barely walk out together.

790
00:57:00.959 --> 00:57:02.709
Don't you dare be a coward.

791
00:57:02.751 --> 00:57:04.251
I'm childless.

792
00:57:07.668 --> 00:57:09.168
The rest I can take.

793
00:57:10.876 --> 00:57:12.334
What people say.

794
00:57:13.793 --> 00:57:15.501
all of that.

795
00:57:17.418 --> 00:57:18.793
For you.

796
00:57:22.793 --> 00:57:24.584
But I want to be a mother

797
00:57:27.709 --> 00:57:29.709
more than anything.

798
00:57:32.584 --> 00:57:34.084
More than us?

799
00:57:36.626 --> 00:57:38.209
Please don't.

800
00:57:38.626 --> 00:57:39.793
No.

801
00:57:40.293 --> 00:57:41.209
Please.

802
00:57:41.251 --> 00:57:42.709
- I'm sorry.
- Please don't do this.

803
00:57:43.501 --> 00:57:44.751
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

804
00:58:30.001 --> 00:58:31.126
What is that?

805
00:58:31.168 --> 00:58:33.043
My birthday hat.

806
00:58:33.084 --> 00:58:34.524
Better not wear it
in the blackout.

807
00:58:37.626 --> 00:58:39.918
See you later.
Happy birthday.

808
00:58:41.959 --> 00:58:43.501
<i>Good morning. Class Two.</i>

809
00:58:43.543 --> 00:58:45.584
<i>We have a new evacuee joining us.</i>

810
00:58:46.209 --> 00:58:50.043
Cassie is staying with Edie Corey.
Isn't that right?

811
00:58:50.376 --> 00:58:52.876
And she's come all the way
from Belfast.

812
00:58:52.918 --> 00:58:55.126
Mr Sullivan.

813
00:58:55.168 --> 00:58:56.501
do you have a moment?

814
00:59:01.084 --> 00:59:02.376
I'll leave you to it.

815
00:59:02.418 --> 00:59:03.518
Right.

816
00:59:04.168 --> 00:59:05.543
Where would you like to sit?

817
00:59:08.001 --> 00:59:09.043
That's my seat.

818
00:59:09.084 --> 00:59:11.751
Let's be kind
to our new friend. please.

819
00:59:12.001 --> 00:59:13.126
There.

820
00:59:13.168 --> 00:59:14.668
Frank'll look after you.

821
00:59:14.709 --> 00:59:16.168
You could be partners.

822
00:59:16.209 --> 00:59:17.626
Frank would like that.

823
00:59:22.459 --> 00:59:23.334
Race you.

824
00:59:23.376 --> 00:59:24.876
What about Cassie?

825
00:59:24.918 --> 00:59:26.209
Shouldn't we ask her?

826
00:59:26.626 --> 00:59:28.501
Last one past the grocer's
a German.

827
00:59:28.876 --> 00:59:30.126
<i>Edie. wait!</i>

828
00:59:33.084 --> 00:59:34.804
- Hello. Granny.
- What in heaven's name...?

829
00:59:34.834 --> 00:59:36.001
We're escaping the Germans.

830
00:59:36.043 --> 00:59:38.251
That is not funny.
Who's this?

831
00:59:38.293 --> 00:59:40.126
Frank.
It's his birthday.

832
00:59:40.168 --> 00:59:42.793
Oh.
Happy birthday. Frank.

833
00:59:43.293 --> 00:59:44.584
Are you having a party?

834
00:59:44.626 --> 00:59:46.668
Yes. and we're going on a trip.

835
00:59:46.709 --> 00:59:47.852
We're trying to find Summerland.

836
00:59:47.876 --> 00:59:48.584
Where?

837
00:59:48.626 --> 00:59:50.459
It's a ghost island
from Mrs Lamb's book.

838
00:59:52.418 --> 00:59:54.084
Right. Frank. off you go.

839
00:59:54.126 --> 00:59:55.584
Edie. you're coming with me.

840
00:59:55.626 --> 00:59:56.834
Come on.

841
00:59:56.876 --> 00:59:58.959
In here.
I need mushrooms.

842
00:59:59.209 --> 01:00:00.834
Whatever was that all about?

843
01:00:00.876 --> 01:00:02.251
Edie's not coming.

844
01:00:04.918 --> 01:00:06.376
Come on.

845
01:00:06.418 --> 01:00:08.001
Let's get going while
the light's good.

846
01:00:11.168 --> 01:00:12.459
Come on.

847
01:00:14.334 --> 01:00:15.668
Come on.

848
01:00:17.126 --> 01:00:19.126
<i>- Mrs. Corey...</i>
- She's up to no good.

849
01:00:19.168 --> 01:00:21.626
And that's not right.
not when there's a child.

850
01:00:21.668 --> 01:00:23.501
You need to do something.

851
01:00:23.543 --> 01:00:25.477
And until then. I don't want Edie
mixing with him.

852
01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:26.793
I can't not go to school.

853
01:00:26.834 --> 01:00:28.876
Or Cassie.
Put him in another class.

854
01:00:28.918 --> 01:00:32.459
For God's sake.
he's just lost his father.

855
01:00:33.001 --> 01:00:35.126
He needs all the friends
he can get.

856
01:00:37.084 --> 01:00:39.251
You. you didn't know?

857
01:00:40.376 --> 01:00:42.126
Aircraft carrier.

858
01:00:42.168 --> 01:00:44.209
Sunk at the weekend.

859
01:00:44.251 --> 01:00:46.209
Terrible business.

860
01:00:46.251 --> 01:00:47.918
Did you have to tell him?

861
01:00:47.959 --> 01:00:50.001
No. Miss Lamb did.

862
01:00:50.876 --> 01:00:52.876
I hope she did it gently.

863
01:00:52.918 --> 01:00:56.251
Bad news is bad news.
however you tell it.

864
01:00:57.251 --> 01:00:59.668
There's nothing makes it easier.

865
01:01:02.668 --> 01:01:04.001
I've got a surprise for you.

866
01:01:04.043 --> 01:01:06.293
- What is it?
- You'll have to wait and see.

867
01:01:07.418 --> 01:01:09.501
Edie. we thought
you weren't coming.

868
01:01:10.084 --> 01:01:11.626
We've got cake.

869
01:01:12.293 --> 01:01:14.084
And jelly rabbit.
Come on.

870
01:01:27.543 --> 01:01:28.543
Surprise!

871
01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:29.418
Who'll go first?

872
01:01:29.459 --> 01:01:30.584
Let's shake for it.

873
01:01:35.043 --> 01:01:35.959
Come on. come on.

874
01:01:36.001 --> 01:01:36.959
Come on. Edie.

875
01:01:37.001 --> 01:01:38.168
Your turn.
Come on.

876
01:01:38.209 --> 01:01:39.126
Don't want to.

877
01:01:39.168 --> 01:01:40.418
Come on.

878
01:01:40.459 --> 01:01:41.584
Ready? Go!

879
01:01:42.418 --> 01:01:43.518
My turn.

880
01:01:45.251 --> 01:01:46.769
What did you get
for your birthday. Frank?

881
01:01:46.793 --> 01:01:48.334
My hat.
I showed you.

882
01:01:49.376 --> 01:01:50.918
I meant from your mum and dad.

883
01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:53.876
Where'd you say they are?

884
01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:55.084
Spin me. Spin me. Spin me.

885
01:01:55.126 --> 01:01:56.501
- Edie...
- I told you.

886
01:01:56.543 --> 01:01:57.935
My mum's doing something
with Ministers

887
01:01:57.959 --> 01:01:59.334
and my dad's got a new plane.

888
01:01:59.793 --> 01:02:01.043
Spin me faster.

889
01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:02.876
No. please.

890
01:02:05.168 --> 01:02:06.268
Edie.

891
01:02:07.876 --> 01:02:09.084
Come on.
Come on.

892
01:02:11.501 --> 01:02:12.668
Edie!

893
01:02:15.418 --> 01:02:17.209
- You haven't told him.
- Edie!

894
01:02:17.793 --> 01:02:19.001
I was trying to protect him.

895
01:02:19.043 --> 01:02:20.001
You're not his mum.

896
01:02:20.043 --> 01:02:21.723
- Edie. please. listen to me.
- You're not.

897
01:02:21.751 --> 01:02:22.751
You're a liar.

898
01:02:22.793 --> 01:02:23.293
A liar!

899
01:02:23.334 --> 01:02:25.334
Edie. please.

900
01:02:26.751 --> 01:02:28.293
- Edie...
- It's not right.

901
01:02:28.334 --> 01:02:29.793
I promise...
It's his birthday.

902
01:02:29.834 --> 01:02:30.459
Please.
I'll tell him...

903
01:02:30.501 --> 01:02:32.227
You're lying to him.
Why won't you tell him?

904
01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:34.251
I'll tell him tomorrow.
I promise.

905
01:02:34.293 --> 01:02:35.876
<i>Promise what?</i>

906
01:02:37.918 --> 01:02:40.043
It's. it's a surprise
for your birthday.

907
01:02:41.918 --> 01:02:43.376
Where were you two going?

908
01:02:43.418 --> 01:02:44.959
We hadn't even had cake yet.

909
01:02:45.001 --> 01:02:47.293
We are.
We are having cake.

910
01:02:47.334 --> 01:02:49.293
Go in.
We'll follow you up.

911
01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:53.751
- Get off me.
- Edie.

912
01:02:54.084 --> 01:02:55.376
- Don't.
- Listen to me.

913
01:02:56.251 --> 01:02:59.209
I promise you.
I will tell him tomorrow.

914
01:02:59.251 --> 01:03:00.709
But just let me do it my way.

915
01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:02.668
You mustn't say anything to him.

916
01:03:02.709 --> 01:03:04.918
Do you understand?
Edie?

917
01:03:05.751 --> 01:03:08.376
Edie. listen to me.
Do you understand?

918
01:03:09.543 --> 01:03:10.643
Edie!

919
01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:14.334
Edie!

920
01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:27.001
<i>Why did Edie go home?</i>

921
01:03:28.334 --> 01:03:30.168
<i>She was just dizzy.</i>

922
01:03:32.793 --> 01:03:34.126
<i>Can I ask you something?</i>

923
01:03:35.918 --> 01:03:37.626
How come only I could see it?

924
01:03:38.168 --> 01:03:39.376
See what?

925
01:03:40.293 --> 01:03:41.626
Summerland.

926
01:03:42.168 --> 01:03:44.209
How come you couldn't?

927
01:03:44.668 --> 01:03:46.334
Maybe I need glasses.

928
01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:51.209
I think someone's trying
to speak to me.

929
01:03:57.418 --> 01:03:58.793
It's just a story.

930
01:04:00.626 --> 01:04:02.168
It's just a trick of the light.

931
01:04:03.793 --> 01:04:05.418
Like a mirage in the desert.

932
01:04:06.418 --> 01:04:07.709
Refraction.

933
01:04:12.959 --> 01:04:14.876
It isn't real.

934
01:04:17.168 --> 01:04:18.751
But if it was.

935
01:04:20.418 --> 01:04:24.751
if it was someone
trying to speak to you.

936
01:04:26.084 --> 01:04:28.126
someone who'd passed.

937
01:04:29.459 --> 01:04:30.918
you know what it would mean?

938
01:04:33.793 --> 01:04:35.293
That they loved you.

939
01:04:36.209 --> 01:04:38.126
Very much.

940
01:04:39.126 --> 01:04:41.001
And they wanted you to know.

941
01:05:00.376 --> 01:05:01.501
N.

942
01:05:02.168 --> 01:05:04.751
N is for "nut".

943
01:05:53.209 --> 01:05:54.876
<i>Take all your things. please.
everyone.</i>

944
01:05:54.918 --> 01:05:56.977
- Don't run! Don't run.
<i>- Make sure you have everything with you.</i>

945
01:05:57.001 --> 01:05:58.185
- Oh. What's the point?
<i>- Hats and boots please.</i>

946
01:05:58.209 --> 01:06:00.543
Go on. then. run.
Do what you like.

947
01:06:00.709 --> 01:06:02.668
Uh... Frank.
Frank.

948
01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:06.251
I'm deeply sorry. Frank.

949
01:06:06.293 --> 01:06:08.168
I... If you need someone
to talk to...

950
01:06:08.209 --> 01:06:09.584
I'm fine. thanks.

951
01:06:10.168 --> 01:06:11.668
S... Sorry?

952
01:06:11.709 --> 01:06:13.459
I'm used to it now.
It's alright.

953
01:06:13.501 --> 01:06:14.876
You...
You don't have to put on

954
01:06:14.918 --> 01:06:17.959
a brave face with me. old chap.

955
01:06:18.001 --> 01:06:20.001
It. it's a terrible shock.

956
01:06:21.418 --> 01:06:22.751
Can I go now?

957
01:06:22.793 --> 01:06:24.334
W-w...
O... Of course.

958
01:08:45.793 --> 01:08:47.001
Do you want a go?

959
01:08:47.043 --> 01:08:48.543
It's for two people.

960
01:08:48.584 --> 01:08:49.834
It's alright.

961
01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:52.310
You can have my turn
if you like.

962
01:08:52.334 --> 01:08:53.584
Frank.

963
01:08:53.626 --> 01:08:55.209
I was only looking.

964
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:57.876
It's your turn.

965
01:08:58.126 --> 01:09:00.084
I'm supposed to
look out for her.

966
01:09:00.126 --> 01:09:02.251
You're a suck.
Just 'cause you fancy her.

967
01:09:02.293 --> 01:09:03.393
I'm not a suck.

968
01:09:03.418 --> 01:09:04.584
You are.

969
01:09:04.876 --> 01:09:06.918
- She's got inside your head.
- Who?

970
01:09:06.959 --> 01:09:08.185
- The witch.
- She's not a witch.

971
01:09:08.209 --> 01:09:09.876
Witch. witch. witch.

972
01:09:09.918 --> 01:09:12.084
- She's not a witch.
- Witch. witch. witch.

973
01:09:12.126 --> 01:09:13.560
Lying witch.
She's not a witch. Shut up.

974
01:09:13.584 --> 01:09:15.084
Shut up.
She's not a witch.

975
01:09:15.126 --> 01:09:17.459
She's a liar.
And you can't even see it.

976
01:09:18.459 --> 01:09:19.584
You're the liar.

977
01:09:20.043 --> 01:09:21.501
She's a liar. Frank.

978
01:09:21.543 --> 01:09:23.751
and you're too stupid to see it.

979
01:09:23.793 --> 01:09:25.168
You're just jealous.

980
01:09:25.209 --> 01:09:27.251
Jealous?
Why would I be jealous?

981
01:09:27.293 --> 01:09:28.834
'Cause you haven't got a mum!

982
01:09:34.168 --> 01:09:36.084
She is a liar.

983
01:09:36.126 --> 01:09:37.709
She's a liar
'cause your dad's dead.

984
01:09:37.751 --> 01:09:39.418
She hasn't even told you!

985
01:09:41.001 --> 01:09:42.334
What are you talking about?

986
01:09:45.334 --> 01:09:46.709
What are you talking about?

987
01:09:48.168 --> 01:09:50.168
Edie. what are you talking about?

988
01:09:50.209 --> 01:09:51.334
My dad's fine.

989
01:09:52.459 --> 01:09:53.709
He's not dead.

990
01:09:55.459 --> 01:09:56.959
Edie. he's not dead.

991
01:09:57.751 --> 01:09:59.293
Say something!

992
01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:08.501
Edie. say something!

993
01:10:15.418 --> 01:10:16.834
What on earth...?

994
01:10:18.668 --> 01:10:19.959
Is this what you had?

995
01:10:21.459 --> 01:10:23.126
- I'm sorry?
- From the evacuee council.

996
01:10:23.168 --> 01:10:25.126
Was it a letter like this.
from the ministry?

997
01:10:25.168 --> 01:10:27.459
You can't go round turning up
at people's houses...

998
01:10:27.501 --> 01:10:30.418
Just tell me how you knew.
when they chose you.

999
01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:31.668
for Cassie.

1000
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:33.834
- When they chose us?
- When they picked you.

1001
01:10:33.876 --> 01:10:35.501
They don't pick you.

1002
01:10:35.543 --> 01:10:37.293
You volunteer.

1003
01:10:37.959 --> 01:10:40.043
We volunteered.
Like you did.

1004
01:10:45.084 --> 01:10:46.126
Think carefully.

1005
01:10:46.168 --> 01:10:48.918
Was there anywhere
or anyone he'd want to go to.

1006
01:10:48.959 --> 01:10:50.459
other than his mother?

1007
01:11:00.834 --> 01:11:01.876
He wouldn't.

1008
01:11:01.918 --> 01:11:03.918
To ladder 218 to London.
Come on!

1009
01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:06.126
but it's always late.
So with any luck...

1010
01:11:25.543 --> 01:11:27.834
Edie. why aren't you in school?

1011
01:11:27.876 --> 01:11:29.126
Edie...

1012
01:11:30.584 --> 01:11:32.209
- you haven't.
- Haven't what?

1013
01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:33.168
You haven't.

1014
01:11:33.209 --> 01:11:34.626
Edit. you haven't told him.

1015
01:11:35.584 --> 01:11:36.293
Where is he?

1016
01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:38.334
- Ms. Lamb...
<i>- What is going on?</i>

1017
01:11:38.376 --> 01:11:40.209
Where is he. Edie?!

1018
01:11:40.376 --> 01:11:41.727
You're certain
he's on the train?

1019
01:11:41.751 --> 01:11:44.543
Yeah. the station master
said there was a boy.

1020
01:11:44.584 --> 01:11:46.751
Well. how could he allow
him on board on his own.

1021
01:11:46.793 --> 01:11:48.709
- It's lunacy.
- Yeah. yeah.

1022
01:11:48.751 --> 01:11:51.584
It will take you hours to drive
and it isn't safe.

1023
01:11:51.626 --> 01:11:53.084
There must be some other way.

1024
01:11:53.126 --> 01:11:54.459
Like what?

1025
01:11:56.584 --> 01:11:58.834
Poor child.
He could be anywhere.

1026
01:12:45.043 --> 01:12:46.334
That's my son.

1027
01:12:53.418 --> 01:12:54.793
Hey. wait!

1028
01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:01.209
Frank.

1029
01:13:11.418 --> 01:13:12.959
Frank!

1030
01:13:13.751 --> 01:13:14.709
What on Earth--

1031
01:13:14.751 --> 01:13:16.209
- Do you mind?
- I'm sorry.

1032
01:13:34.876 --> 01:13:36.793
- Where's...
- Down the next street.

1033
01:13:44.459 --> 01:13:45.751
Behind you.

1034
01:14:32.793 --> 01:14:33.893
Frank.

1035
01:14:35.126 --> 01:14:36.543
Frank.

1036
01:14:38.876 --> 01:14:40.543
- Sir. Sir.
- Yes. ma'am.

1037
01:14:40.584 --> 01:14:42.376
Who was in the house?
Number 12.

1038
01:14:42.418 --> 01:14:43.543
Don't know nothing. ma'am.

1039
01:14:43.584 --> 01:14:44.251
But a neighbor.

1040
01:14:44.293 --> 01:14:45.751
someone must have seen.
must know.

1041
01:14:45.793 --> 01:14:47.935
- His mother lives there.
- You'll just have to wait like everyone else.

1042
01:14:47.959 --> 01:14:50.459
- How long?
- It takes time. I don't...

1043
01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:52.043
Days most likely.

1044
01:14:52.084 --> 01:14:54.084
Six streets hit in Lambeth
last night.

1045
01:14:54.918 --> 01:14:56.251
I tell you what.

1046
01:14:56.293 --> 01:14:57.709
leave your details

1047
01:14:58.376 --> 01:14:59.751
and go home. ma'am.

1048
01:15:01.126 --> 01:15:02.334
I'm sorry.

1049
01:15:03.418 --> 01:15:04.876
Thank you.

1050
01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:06.001
This isn't safe.

1051
01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:08.293
Everyone take shelter now!

1052
01:15:08.334 --> 01:15:09.459
Now!

1053
01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:49.293
The promised to telephone.

1054
01:15:50.001 --> 01:15:52.126
The moment they hear anything.

1055
01:15:55.043 --> 01:15:56.501
Frank.

1056
01:15:58.501 --> 01:16:00.626
She wouldn't want you
to be here.

1057
01:16:02.543 --> 01:16:04.584
In London.
Where it isn't safe.

1058
01:16:09.084 --> 01:16:10.959
Come with me for her.

1059
01:16:13.501 --> 01:16:14.959
Please.

1060
01:16:33.418 --> 01:16:35.293
Shall we have the wireless on?

1061
01:16:47.251 --> 01:16:48.626
- Stop the car!
- What?

1062
01:16:48.668 --> 01:16:49.793
Stop the car!

1063
01:16:52.209 --> 01:16:53.309
Frank!

1064
01:16:57.584 --> 01:16:58.751
Frank!

1065
01:17:02.959 --> 01:17:04.209
Frank!

1066
01:17:13.001 --> 01:17:14.334
Frank!

1067
01:17:19.251 --> 01:17:20.584
Frank!

1068
01:17:37.251 --> 01:17:38.584
Frank!

1069
01:17:41.668 --> 01:17:42.768
Frank.

1070
01:17:43.376 --> 01:17:44.751
It isn't safe.

1071
01:17:48.543 --> 01:17:51.168
You knew and you didn't say.

1072
01:17:51.209 --> 01:17:53.334
I wanted to tell you.

1073
01:17:55.834 --> 01:17:59.084
I didn't know how.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1074
01:17:59.918 --> 01:18:01.334
I felt it.

1075
01:18:01.959 --> 01:18:05.251
<i>I saw him. my dad.
in Summerland.</i>

1076
01:18:06.584 --> 01:18:07.918
I saw him.

1077
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:11.043
There.

1078
01:18:44.959 --> 01:18:46.209
Frank!

1079
01:18:47.126 --> 01:18:48.226
Frank!

1080
01:20:13.626 --> 01:20:15.209
Here.

1081
01:20:19.626 --> 01:20:21.418
Can I sit down?

1082
01:20:34.834 --> 01:20:35.934
Frank...

1083
01:20:38.793 --> 01:20:40.334
I'm sorry.

1084
01:20:50.334 --> 01:20:51.918
I lost my father.

1085
01:20:54.126 --> 01:20:55.959
He was on the Majestic.

1086
01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:58.709
one of the greatest ships
in the fleet.

1087
01:21:02.418 --> 01:21:04.376
One of the hardest things was

1088
01:21:05.459 --> 01:21:07.751
we didn't know how to grieve.

1089
01:21:09.001 --> 01:21:11.626
He was just gone.

1090
01:21:13.459 --> 01:21:14.626
Out there.

1091
01:21:18.251 --> 01:21:20.001
War.

1092
01:21:23.459 --> 01:21:27.418
You know.
he loved stories of the sea.

1093
01:21:29.668 --> 01:21:31.626
Norsemen.

1094
01:21:32.959 --> 01:21:36.209
He said when a Viking died.

1095
01:21:36.251 --> 01:21:39.626
they lay them on their boat
set it ablaze

1096
01:21:39.668 --> 01:21:41.626
and sent it out into the waves.

1097
01:21:43.084 --> 01:21:47.626
The fire freed their spirit
so it'd float away to paradise.

1098
01:21:49.251 --> 01:21:50.959
So we built a boat for him.

1099
01:21:54.668 --> 01:21:56.334
What sort of boat?

1100
01:21:58.334 --> 01:22:00.293
Out of paper and sticks.

1101
01:22:01.709 --> 01:22:03.418
We waited till it was dark.

1102
01:22:04.209 --> 01:22:07.001
Then we set it alight
and let it sail out to sea.

1103
01:22:08.043 --> 01:22:10.668
watched till the last embers
burned away.

1104
01:22:12.584 --> 01:22:15.459
I suppose it was our way
of saying goodbye.

1105
01:22:20.293 --> 01:22:21.793
Go on.

1106
01:22:46.751 --> 01:22:50.251
I know you might not
be here for long.

1107
01:22:51.376 --> 01:22:52.668
but while you are.

1108
01:22:54.001 --> 01:22:55.584
it's yours.

1109
01:23:20.543 --> 01:23:22.084
What sort of plane's that?

1110
01:23:22.126 --> 01:23:23.226
Tiger Moth.

1111
01:23:24.543 --> 01:23:26.918
Once I went in the cockpit.

1112
01:23:26.959 --> 01:23:27.876
Did your mother know?

1113
01:23:27.918 --> 01:23:30.959
No.
She's scared of planes.

1114
01:23:31.001 --> 01:23:32.584
She likes cars.

1115
01:23:36.293 --> 01:23:37.876
Do you have a favorite one?

1116
01:23:41.043 --> 01:23:42.143
Here.

1117
01:24:09.251 --> 01:24:10.709
Round or straight?

1118
01:24:11.084 --> 01:24:12.418
Round. please.

1119
01:24:13.126 --> 01:24:14.501
Knock. knock.

1120
01:24:14.543 --> 01:24:15.293
Sir's here.

1121
01:24:15.334 --> 01:24:18.209
I just wanted to check on
the return of the native.

1122
01:24:18.834 --> 01:24:21.376
Quite an adventure
you've had. eh?

1123
01:24:22.209 --> 01:24:24.251
Miss Lamb. I wonder if. um...

1124
01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:26.501
Er...
We need more sticks.

1125
01:24:26.543 --> 01:24:27.918
Do you want to go
and fetch some?

1126
01:24:30.793 --> 01:24:34.418
Yes. I. um. I. er.
hope you don't mind.

1127
01:24:34.459 --> 01:24:36.293
I know what you're going to say.

1128
01:24:37.043 --> 01:24:38.501
I know it was wrong.

1129
01:24:39.543 --> 01:24:42.334
But I couldn't tell him.
It's...

1130
01:24:44.293 --> 01:24:46.501
These things don't come
naturally to me.

1131
01:24:46.543 --> 01:24:47.643
No.

1132
01:24:48.876 --> 01:24:52.584
Nobody knows how to be a parent.
especially now.

1133
01:24:53.126 --> 01:24:56.584
We all just muddle through
as best we can.

1134
01:24:57.084 --> 01:24:58.418
But you two.

1135
01:24:58.876 --> 01:25:01.918
well. I never thought
I'd live to say it. but.

1136
01:25:01.959 --> 01:25:03.834
gosh. you make quite a pair.

1137
01:25:06.459 --> 01:25:09.293
He has a great deal...
to cope with now.

1138
01:25:09.334 --> 01:25:10.501
He's going to need you.

1139
01:25:12.459 --> 01:25:14.709
You're doing a grand job.
Miss Lamb.

1140
01:25:15.251 --> 01:25:16.584
Alice.

1141
01:25:16.918 --> 01:25:18.084
Alice.

1142
01:25:20.501 --> 01:25:22.126
Who'd have thought it?

1143
01:25:22.334 --> 01:25:23.434
Yeah. better watch out.

1144
01:25:23.459 --> 01:25:24.977
or they'll send you
a whole train load of them.

1145
01:25:25.001 --> 01:25:26.626
No. no. no. no
I absolutely can't.

1146
01:25:26.668 --> 01:25:28.293
I. I'm joking.
I'm joking.

1147
01:25:29.376 --> 01:25:30.793
They wouldn't dare.

1148
01:25:47.376 --> 01:25:48.793
You left the lights on.

1149
01:25:49.584 --> 01:25:51.001
No. I didn't.

1150
01:26:08.459 --> 01:26:09.709
<i>Mummy!</i>

1151
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:11.584
<i>Frank!</i>

1152
01:26:11.626 --> 01:26:12.726
<i>Mummy!</i>

1153
01:26:36.834 --> 01:26:38.251
Hello. Alice.

1154
01:26:49.626 --> 01:26:51.084
We've been making a plane.

1155
01:26:52.459 --> 01:26:53.559
Have you?

1156
01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:56.543
What sort of plane?

1157
01:27:02.293 --> 01:27:03.626
One like Daddy's.

1158
01:27:05.418 --> 01:27:06.543
It's for him.

1159
01:27:10.043 --> 01:27:12.126
It isn't finished yet.

1160
01:28:41.334 --> 01:28:44.876
I'm so sorry.
About your husband.

1161
01:28:51.084 --> 01:28:52.459
Thank you

1162
01:28:54.001 --> 01:28:55.834
for keeping Frank safe.

1163
01:28:57.709 --> 01:29:01.584
I just knew if anything
happened to us.

1164
01:29:03.376 --> 01:29:06.918
you were the only one I'd trust
to take care of him.

1165
01:29:07.668 --> 01:29:09.293
He could have died.

1166
01:29:12.168 --> 01:29:14.334
If I hadn't been so stupid.

1167
01:29:17.376 --> 01:29:18.668
- I'm sorry. Vee.
- Al...

1168
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:20.543
I'm sorry.

1169
01:29:21.376 --> 01:29:23.334
You saved his life.

1170
01:29:27.168 --> 01:29:29.043
Thank you.

1171
01:29:31.251 --> 01:29:32.626
I'm sorry.

1172
01:29:35.459 --> 01:29:37.501
It's silly.

1173
01:29:39.459 --> 01:29:42.584
There was a teacloth somewhere.

1174
01:29:42.626 --> 01:29:44.626
Or you could use a handkerchief.

1175
01:29:46.334 --> 01:29:48.126
Like a normal person.

1176
01:30:40.751 --> 01:30:42.293
Bugger off.

1177
01:30:44.043 --> 01:30:47.876
<i>Are you rewriting again?
He'll be here any minute.</i>

1178
01:30:47.918 --> 01:30:51.543
Well. just go away
and stop distracting me.

1179
01:30:51.584 --> 01:30:53.543
I like distracting you.

1180
01:30:56.084 --> 01:30:59.126
Look at this.
I might enjoy this one.

1181
01:31:01.084 --> 01:31:02.751
Not when you see how
I've written you.

1182
01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:07.001
I thought I'd be the heroine.

1183
01:31:07.043 --> 01:31:08.501
Tracking you down.

1184
01:31:09.084 --> 01:31:11.084
- Like Poirot.
- Oh. really.

1185
01:31:11.543 --> 01:31:13.334
You stumble into a bookshop.

1186
01:31:13.376 --> 01:31:15.084
make one call to a publisher.

1187
01:31:15.126 --> 01:31:17.626
It hardly qualifies you
as the next Agatha Christie.

1188
01:31:17.668 --> 01:31:19.209
Stumbled?

1189
01:31:20.334 --> 01:31:23.168
There was nothing
accidental about it.

1190
01:31:23.626 --> 01:31:27.793
It was the twenty-third shop
I'd tried.

1191
01:31:33.626 --> 01:31:35.126
You never told me that.

1192
01:31:40.334 --> 01:31:41.434
Come on.

1193
01:31:45.209 --> 01:31:46.626
I'll catch you up.

1194
01:32:34.751 --> 01:32:35.918
I've finished it.

1195
01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:37.684
Would you believe it?

1196
01:32:38.668 --> 01:32:39.834
Can I have a look?

1197
01:33:00.084 --> 01:33:01.184
Come on.

1198
01:33:02.334 --> 01:33:03.751
I thought we'd go for chips.

1199
01:33:07.668 --> 01:33:09.668
Well. if you want chips.
