(tense electronic tones)

6
00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:37.583
- I thought I had more time.

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:50.292
(woman screams)

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:07.375
(anxious piano music)

9
00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:21.083
- It's time.

10
00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:24.667
Send the invitations.

11
00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:28.750

(anxious classical violin music)

14
00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:14.250
I apologize about that. fellas.

15
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.707
Very nice to meet you all.

16
00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:19.457
- Anyways. before we
get down to the reason

17
00:04:19.457 --> 00:04:22.042
for why we're here.
let's just sit back.

18
00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:25.832
have a few drinks and
get to know each other.

19
00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:28.332
- The symmetry of this film.

20
00:04:28.332 --> 00:04:32.667
the way they composed each
shot. the acting. I mean.

21
00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:35.292
I can't believe it.
- It's pretty good.

22
00:04:35.292 --> 00:04:36.582
Yo. could I?

23
00:04:36.582 --> 00:04:39.832
- What do you
think. you want one?

24
00:04:39.832 --> 00:04:41.582
- It's been a minute.

25
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.707
- It was amazing.
absolutely amazing.

26
00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:51.875
So Logan. let me tell you.

27
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:55.125
your last film was
truly an experience.

28
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.082
To think that I'm sitting
at this dinner table

29
00:04:58.082 --> 00:05:01.417
with potentially the greatest
filmmaker of our generation.

30
00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:03.833
- I can attest to that
Logan. your last film was.

31
00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:05.667
some might call it a
religious experience.

32
00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:07.042
- Fellas. listen.

33
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.042
We're just some guys having
drinks at a table. that's all.

34
00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:14.208
Nick.

35
00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:16.792
Quite the performance at

36
00:05:16.792 --> 00:05:18.500
the Grammy's a couple
months ago. huh?

37
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.457
- Oh yeah. appreciate that.

38
00:05:20.457 --> 00:05:22.207
I'm just more baffled
that I'm sitting

39
00:05:22.207 --> 00:05:23.750
across from this
mastermind right now.

40
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.917
- Men. listen.

41
00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:29.125
I understand this
is strange. okay?

42
00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:30.832
The reason you're here is
'cause you're some of the most

43
00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:33.625
creative and talented people
in the world right now.

44
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.792
all of you just as
successful as the next.

45
00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:39.417
The world's in front of
each and every one of you.

46
00:05:39.417 --> 00:05:43.042
- Yeah. I made a good
film. great. awesome.

47
00:05:45.082 --> 00:05:46.292
I appreciate your love

48
00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:49.292
and support but I'm
just a guy. truly.

49
00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:59.625
And you want to know the
difference between us and them?

50
00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:04.208
We are the true talent.

51
00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:08.958
The unique. the pure.

52
00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:15.125
We're not the shallow.

53
00:06:18.207 --> 00:06:22.917
So Andrew. any new projects
you've been working on?

54
00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:25.957
- Yeah. actually I'm working
on this project right now.

55
00:06:25.957 --> 00:06:29.707
It's an adaptation of a
book called "The Swerve."

56
00:06:29.707 --> 00:06:32.792
- Yeah. and the. what is it?

57
00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.625
"The Nature of Things." right?
- Yeah. that's right.

58
00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:36.167
"The Nature of Things."

59
00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:38.500
- That's good.
- What's the story?

60
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.332
- It's a hunt for
an ancient poem

61
00:06:40.332 --> 00:06:42.167
that basically tells the future.

62
00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:43.582
It's gonna be an adventure film

63
00:06:43.582 --> 00:06:45.042
and we have a big
budget this time.

64
00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:47.375
I'm pretty excited
about that actually.

65
00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:48.957
- You're with Old Oaks
Entertainment. right?

66
00:06:48.957 --> 00:06:51.082
- Yeah. Old Oaks Entertainment.

67
00:06:51.082 --> 00:06:52.792
- Any notable castings?

68
00:06:52.792 --> 00:06:56.500
- We're still in pretty
early stages. so no. not yet.

69
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.042
- [Logan] What
about Arthur here?

70
00:06:59.042 --> 00:07:00.667
I mean I don't
want to put my foot

71
00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:03.042
in my mouth or anything
but it's a little bit

72
00:07:03.042 --> 00:07:05.708
more dramatic than the
stuff you're used to.

73
00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:07.375
(Logan laughs)

74
00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:09.500
- Arthur. he says
you can't do drama.

75
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.833
- That's good. that's good.
- That's not it at all.

76
00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:13.500
It would be a dream
come true to have you.

77
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.792
- I fuckin' love that.

78
00:07:15.792 --> 00:07:19.417
- I'm just joking.
I'm just joking. wine?

79
00:07:19.417 --> 00:07:21.832
- Oh. no thanks. I'm good.

80
00:07:21.832 --> 00:07:24.957
- This meeting's a celebration
of success. come on.

81
00:07:24.957 --> 00:07:27.042
- No seriously. I'm okay.

82
00:07:27.957 --> 00:07:28.792
- Okay.

83
00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:35.082
Flynn. the master artist.
what have you been working on?

84
00:07:36.332 --> 00:07:38.832
- Well. recently I've
been working less

85
00:07:38.832 --> 00:07:42.082
for myself and more
for commission.

86
00:07:42.082 --> 00:07:43.875
Not because I need
it or anything

87
00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:46.500
but I'm becoming more popular.

88
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.707
You see. these wealthy people.

89
00:07:48.707 --> 00:07:51.207
they're willing to buy my
art for a commission price.

90
00:07:51.207 --> 00:07:55.292
footing their homes. their
apartments or whatever.

91
00:07:55.292 --> 00:07:57.375
It's been good to me.

92
00:07:57.375 --> 00:08:00.000
- Chrone. what about you.
big guy. what you been up to?

93
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.708
I heard that movie "Nebulous."

94
00:08:01.708 --> 00:08:03.250
- Yeah. "Nebulous."

95
00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:07.458
Great script. a cosmic
murder mystery. you watch it?

96
00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:09.542
- Yeah. I did.
- Really intense.

97
00:08:09.542 --> 00:08:11.750
Had my knuckles
white the whole film.

98
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.417
Not to mention. I think it
was your broadest range yet.

99
00:08:15.417 --> 00:08:18.582
- Thank you. I
appreciate that Logan.

100
00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:20.667
Yeah but you know.

101
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.417
it's good for me now
to take some time off.

102
00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:25.332
I mean I've been in
this business. what?

103
00:08:25.332 --> 00:08:27.582
Since I was five years old.

104
00:08:28.792 --> 00:08:32.042
So I'll just take some
time. focus on myself.

105
00:08:32.042 --> 00:08:33.917
That kinda stuff.

106
00:08:33.917 --> 00:08:35.332
- Godspeed.

107
00:08:35.332 --> 00:08:37.667
And my musical
friend what of you?

108
00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:41.292
- I mean I'm on tour. I mean
pretty much late in the tour.

109
00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:43.000
But I got the phone
call about this

110
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.625
and I knew it was something
I couldn't pass up.

111
00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:48.250
So you know. here we are.

112
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.458
- I think you made
the right choice.

113
00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:54.042
(soft anxious piano music)

114
00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:59.875
(thunder booming)

115
00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:03.625
Gentlemen. I gather
you here on this

116
00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:05.833
glorious occasion
because you are some

117
00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:09.417
of the world's most up and
coming creators right now.

118
00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:10.833
An artist.

119
00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:12.333
a musician.

120
00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:13.167
an actor

121
00:09:14.042 --> 00:09:15.292
and a director.

122
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.500
I gather you here because
I've written my next script

123
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.750
and one of you will
be chosen to have it

124
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.042
and adapt it into
any way you so choose

125
00:09:26.042 --> 00:09:29.625
as long as you remain true
to the text on the page.

126
00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:33.167
It is the greatest
thing I've ever written.

127
00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:36.333
Now there are a few rules.

128
00:09:36.333 --> 00:09:38.792
You must stay until
Sunday evening

129
00:09:38.792 --> 00:09:41.167
and you must have a good time.

130
00:09:41.167 --> 00:09:42.500
Sunday evening. I will choose

131
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.667
the recipient of the
script and that's all.

132
00:09:45.667 --> 00:09:48.833
We all go our separate ways.

133
00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:51.042
- Why wouldn't you make it?

134
00:09:54.083 --> 00:09:56.583
- Afraid I won't do it
justice this time around.

135
00:09:56.583 --> 00:10:01.292
My last film drained me.
for a lack of better words.

136
00:10:01.292 --> 00:10:03.417
I believe in one of you.

137
00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:05.042
- You expect one
of us to make it?

138
00:10:05.042 --> 00:10:07.125
Bro. I do music. I don't know
how to make a fucking film.

139
00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:08.917
- It's not about knowing.

140
00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:12.250
It's about how you
see it. your vision.

141
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.917
- What's it about?

142
00:10:13.917 --> 00:10:16.750
- That'll be for the eyes of
the chosen one. as you will.

143
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.292
Gentlemen. if you don't want
to be here. then you can go.

144
00:10:20.292 --> 00:10:24.542
There'll be no hard feelings
but. but. but if you stay.

145
00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:27.250
you might like what you find.

146
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.542
Plus. when are you gonna have

147
00:10:28.542 --> 00:10:30.750
a weekend this
interesting again?

148
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.333
Look where you are.

149
00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:35.292
You in. Andrew?

150
00:10:36.708 --> 00:10:37.500
- I'm in.

151
00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:39.333
- Flynn?

152
00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:42.292
- I suppose.

153
00:10:42.292 --> 00:10:43.083
- Arthur?

154
00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:47.292
Nick?
- Fuck yeah.

155
00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:54.167
- [Logan] Good.

156
00:10:54.167 --> 00:10:57.167
(film reel rattling)

157
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.792
(relaxed piano music)

158
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.708
- You gotta let us know
how you made that film.

159
00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:32.875
- It was just a beautiful
idea that hit me.

160
00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:36.833
Sometimes a rose is a
rose is a rose. you know?

161
00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:40.042
- Listen. I'm a music guy but
I'm also a movie guy and that

162
00:11:40.042 --> 00:11:44.000
shit was the most mind-fucking
movie I've ever seen.

163
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.792
- It was pretty damn
good. wasn't it?

164
00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:46.792
- Damn good.

165
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.958
- What's playing
on the screen here?

166
00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:58.708
- This is an old film.
old experimental film

167
00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:01.667
known as "Adoration."

168
00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:04.667
It runs about 11
to 12 hours long.

169
00:12:04.667 --> 00:12:08.208
It fuels my creativity.
I watch it all the time

170
00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:11.292
and every time I
watch it. it changes

171
00:12:12.667 --> 00:12:13.500
or I do.

172
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.042
I don't know.

173
00:12:16.042 --> 00:12:17.667
- Is there a story to it?

174
00:12:17.667 --> 00:12:18.958
- I've been trying to piece one

175
00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.917
together for a long time now.

176
00:12:20.917 --> 00:12:23.958
I believe it's about
a young girl wandering

177
00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.750
the woods and this young
girl has two sides.

178
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.417
one side human but one
side. something else.

179
00:12:32.292 --> 00:12:33.875
Such courage in it.

180
00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:39.250
You know. you'd be surprised.

181
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.792
I come off as a movie guy
but I'm also a music guy.

182
00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:48.667
So I've been experimenting
with the guitar a bit.

183
00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.875
I call this one "The Cave."

184
00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:16.042
(up tempo rock music)

185
00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:00.667
- [Nick] Damn. love it. yo.

186
00:14:00.667 --> 00:14:02.333
You got that Robert
Johnson vibe in there.

187
00:14:02.333 --> 00:14:03.167
- Yeah?

188
00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:07.583
Robert Johnson. huh?

189
00:14:07.583 --> 00:14:09.500
- Who's Robert Johnson?

190
00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:14.250
- A man who sold his
soul to the Devil

191
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.458
at a crossroad in Mississippi.

192
00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:21.167
In exchange. the Devil handed
him back his guitar. tuned.

193
00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.000
- I got one more for you.

194
00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:39.833
(warbling mid
tempo guitar music)

195
00:15:21.083 --> 00:15:24.167
Beautiful song. right Flynn?

196
00:15:24.167 --> 00:15:25.000
- Yes.

197
00:15:30.333 --> 00:15:32.042
- This place is amazing. Logan.

198
00:15:32.042 --> 00:15:34.125
You live here year round?

199
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.333
- Actually it runs
in the family.

200
00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:40.333
It's where my father
used to write.

201
00:15:40.333 --> 00:15:42.250
But no. I usually am in my place

202
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.917
in New York or my
apartment in LA.

203
00:15:43.917 --> 00:15:45.875
I'm very fortunate. you see.

204
00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:48.042
But I know you guys have
all bright futures too.

205
00:15:48.042 --> 00:15:51.042
I mean. we're all
practically the same age.

206
00:15:51.042 --> 00:15:53.667
I was just at the right
place at the right time.

207
00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:55.375
It's called luck.

208
00:15:55.375 --> 00:15:57.583
- Luck may have a part
of it but nobody's

209
00:15:57.583 --> 00:16:00.042
gonna doubt the greatness
in that head of yours.

210
00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:03.375
- I appreciate that.
Arthur. I truly do.

211
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.417
- So. I saw your debut
film. very. very well done.

212
00:16:10.458 --> 00:16:11.708
- Thank you.

213
00:16:11.708 --> 00:16:12.917
- How were you able
to get all the pieces

214
00:16:12.917 --> 00:16:15.417
together and make
such a good product?

215
00:16:15.417 --> 00:16:19.417
- Well. I was in my
college town and I figured

216
00:16:19.417 --> 00:16:23.375
I'd make a movie
about depression.
existentialism. anxiety.

217
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:26.292
I had my boys there with
me. so we did it together

218
00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:30.375
and honestly I never expected
it to but it blew up.

219
00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:33.042
- Yeah. I really enjoyed it.

220
00:16:33.042 --> 00:16:34.417
- Thanks.

221
00:16:34.417 --> 00:16:36.458
- Truly an accomplishment.

222
00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:38.375
If I'm not too bold to say it.

223
00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:40.083
you come from the
middle of nowhere

224
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:43.417
with no connections in
this industry or any others

225
00:16:43.417 --> 00:16:47.125
and yet you were found.
your voice was heard.

226
00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:51.292
- Thank you. but it
was very unexpected.

227
00:16:51.292 --> 00:16:52.125
- Very.

228
00:16:53.583 --> 00:16:56.625
Flynn. you're a
deeply unique artist.

229
00:16:58.333 --> 00:17:00.583
Tell me something profound.

230
00:17:02.583 --> 00:17:03.417
- Well.

231
00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:07.458
I guess it's a famous quote.

232
00:17:08.708 --> 00:17:09.875
"If you think.

233
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.583
you are doomed."

234
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:15.333
That's why I paint.

235
00:17:16.375 --> 00:17:19.583
- "If you think.
you are doomed."

236
00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:22.458
That's one way of
looking at it of course.

237
00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:25.166
Man's greatest
enemy is his mind.

238
00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:29.792
But I also believe man's
greatest ally is his mind.

239
00:17:29.792 --> 00:17:34.208
So if you think you are doomed.
no. I don't believe that.

240
00:17:34.208 --> 00:17:36.708
If you think. you may be free.

241
00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:41.375
- [Arthur] Cheers to that.

242
00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:43.000
- [Logan] Cheers to us. men.

243
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.708
To our work and our lives.

244
00:17:45.708 --> 00:17:48.667
(soft piano music)

245
00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:14.125
- That was fun. wasn't it?

246
00:18:14.125 --> 00:18:15.500
- Yeah. it was.

247
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.750
I like your friend Lauren a lot.

248
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.333
- Yeah. she's the best.

249
00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:19.833
- Where's she from again?

250
00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:23.250
- California. she cannot stop
talking about your movie.

251
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.083
- Yeah. it was
really sweet of her.

252
00:18:26.083 --> 00:18:29.500
- So. have you spoken
to mom recently?

253
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.750
- No. I haven't gotten around
to it but I probably should.

254
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.208
- You really should.
I don't know.

255
00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:39.042
She just seems super
lonely these days.

256
00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:42.875
- I know. I've just been so
busy. I haven't been able to.

257
00:18:42.875 --> 00:18:44.375
- Yeah. I get it.

258
00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:47.333
Thanks for coming to visit
me. you being a big shot now.

259
00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:49.542
- Shut up. you know I
love coming down here.

260
00:18:49.542 --> 00:18:51.542
- Well. there was
also one more thing

261
00:18:51.542 --> 00:18:53.208
that I want to
talk to you about.

262
00:18:53.208 --> 00:18:54.042
- Oh yeah?

263
00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:58.542
- So I kept it a secret for
a couple of days now when

264
00:18:58.542 --> 00:19:02.083
you were visiting and I want
you to be the first to know.

265
00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:03.708
- [Andrew] What is it?

266
00:19:03.708 --> 00:19:05.917
Don't tell me you're pregnant.

267
00:19:05.917 --> 00:19:07.583
- No. Luke proposed.

268
00:19:08.417 --> 00:19:10.083
- No.
- Yes.

269
00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:11.750
- Oh my god.
- Can you believe it?

270
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.250
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

271
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.083
- Wow.

272
00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.417
How'd he do it?

273
00:19:16.417 --> 00:19:18.667
- I'll tell you in the car.
- Okay.

274
00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:20.792
Wow. I'm so happy for you.

275
00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:22.833
- Yeah. he's really
the best guy.

276
00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:23.667
- Shit.

277
00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:26.708
Oh jeez.

278
00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:29.125
- [Adrianne] You're
good to drive. right?

279
00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:30.375
- Yeah. oh yeah.

280
00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:31.708
- You didn't drink or anything?

281
00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:33.917
- I had like one or
two. but I'm good.

282
00:19:33.917 --> 00:19:36.750
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. absolutely.

283
00:19:44.292 --> 00:19:47.125
(thunder booming)

284
00:19:57.875 --> 00:19:58.708
- Andrew.

285
00:20:00.708 --> 00:20:03.250
you're so soft-spoken.

286
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:07.125
I've seen you in interviews
before and you're so talkative.

287
00:20:07.125 --> 00:20:10.208
- Yeah. I was probably
fucking drunk.

288
00:20:12.792 --> 00:20:15.125
I had a bit of a drinking
problem on my last film.

289
00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:17.500
So. I've toned it down a bit.

290
00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:21.000
- Cheers to that.

291
00:20:26.542 --> 00:20:31.375
I guess it takes courage to
admit when you have a problem.

292
00:20:39.458 --> 00:20:41.250
Me myself. personally.

293
00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:46.167
I never use this to cope with
anything going on around me.

294
00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:50.375
I use it as a point of
celebration amongst friends.

295
00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:53.417
It's good.

296
00:20:53.417 --> 00:20:55.500
- On tour. I probably
drink way too much.

297
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.792
I mean every city.
new night. new liquor.

298
00:20:59.875 --> 00:21:01.333
There's not really
much I can do about it.

299
00:21:01.333 --> 00:21:04.292
It's a terrible
habit but you know.

300
00:21:04.292 --> 00:21:06.500
it comes with the
career. I love doing it

301
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.792
and I'm rich. so
I guess I'm gone.

302
00:21:08.792 --> 00:21:11.208
- You enjoy performing?

303
00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:13.208
- Yeah of course. I
mean I love performing.

304
00:21:13.208 --> 00:21:15.042
All my best memories.

305
00:21:15.042 --> 00:21:16.667
- I love our shows.

306
00:21:17.917 --> 00:21:21.500
Having random
unintelligent rat critics

307
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.417
scurry around my work.
trying to figure it out.

308
00:21:27.542 --> 00:21:29.750
That's why I drink.

309
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.042
- It was a funny thing.

310
00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:36.250
In old Italy. a parallel
between alcohol and death.

311
00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:41.875
I'm not saying alcohol
necessarily causes death. no.

312
00:21:41.875 --> 00:21:45.208
But it moves us from a
point of clear consciousness

313
00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:48.750
closer to death. as if
we're on a spectrum.

314
00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:52.292
Funny. isn't it?

315
00:21:52.292 --> 00:21:56.542
Because when you drink. you
feel so much more alive.

316
00:22:01.167 --> 00:22:05.750
And I must warn you. I have
another guest in the house.

317
00:22:07.083 --> 00:22:08.417
He is my doctor.

318
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.042
Well. more my mentor.

319
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.708
I've been going through
a slightly troubled time

320
00:22:16.708 --> 00:22:20.125
since my last film and
he's helping me through it.

321
00:22:20.125 --> 00:22:23.375
He's a bit antisocial.
a bit unorthodox

322
00:22:25.375 --> 00:22:28.083
but pay him no mind.
he means very well.

323
00:22:28.083 --> 00:22:29.917
(anxious violin music)

324
00:22:29.917 --> 00:22:32.125
- What kinda doctor?

325
00:22:32.125 --> 00:22:34.708
- A psychologist. more or less.

326
00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:39.625
Don't be startled
when you see him.

327
00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:41.792
He's just a bit out there.

328
00:22:42.667 --> 00:22:44.000
- Out there how?

329
00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:48.708
- You'll know when you see him.

330
00:22:53.292 --> 00:22:56.375
(anxious piano music)

331
00:23:06.917 --> 00:23:10.750
(anxious electronic warbling)

332
00:24:06.917 --> 00:24:09.292
Good morning. Andrew.

333
00:24:09.292 --> 00:24:11.917
- Good morning. Logan.

334
00:24:11.917 --> 00:24:13.792
- You drink coffee?

335
00:24:13.792 --> 00:24:15.250
- Of course.

336
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.500
- Well. there's
coffee in the kitchen.

337
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.625
Grab yourself a
cup and then after.

338
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:22.875
meet me outside. I got
something to show you. okay?

339
00:24:22.875 --> 00:24:24.500
- Sure.
- All right.

340
00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:29.542
(relaxed guitar music)

341
00:24:32.125 --> 00:24:36.042
(anxious metallic piano music)

342
00:25:12.958 --> 00:25:15.958
So. you saw my doctor wandering

343
00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:19.667
the grounds last
night. didn't you?

344
00:25:19.667 --> 00:25:21.667
- I did. how'd you know?

345
00:25:24.542 --> 00:25:27.042
- You seem uncomfortable here.

346
00:25:28.625 --> 00:25:31.583
The only reason I can
see causing that is you

347
00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:36.583
witnessing a masked man wander
outside your room at night.

348
00:25:37.708 --> 00:25:40.500
- It's true. why does
he wear that mask?

349
00:25:42.167 --> 00:25:46.417
- He's strange. his methods
aren't always approved.

350
00:25:47.375 --> 00:25:49.458
- Approved. approved how?

351
00:25:52.167 --> 00:25:53.833
- He uses hypnotism.

352
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:59.792
brings me to a place of
peace and clear-mindedness.

353
00:25:59.792 --> 00:26:01.708
The mask just calms me.

354
00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:06.125
it separates me
from his human side.

355
00:26:11.917 --> 00:26:15.833
You know it all started
right here. what we do.

356
00:26:17.083 --> 00:26:19.167
on walls just like these.

357
00:26:20.167 --> 00:26:22.083
- [Andrew] What's that?

358
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.833
- Art.

359
00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:28.333
No likes. no
streams. no dislikes.

360
00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:29.167
Just pure.

361
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.417
- How do you know
if it's any good?

362
00:26:34.542 --> 00:26:35.375
- Funny.

363
00:26:37.167 --> 00:26:40.167
Maybe it's the way it should be.

364
00:26:40.167 --> 00:26:41.333
Let's go back.

365
00:26:48.792 --> 00:26:52.542
(light anxious guitar music)

366
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.583

(low. tense violin music)

383
00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:39.417
- Why

384
00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:42.375
do you keep

385
00:28:43.667 --> 00:28:45.417
making me watch this?

386
00:28:50.417 --> 00:28:52.167
Please shut this off.

387
00:29:05.792 --> 00:29:09.208
(tense electronic tones)

388
00:29:20.333 --> 00:29:23.917
(anxious deep piano music)

389
00:29:40.708 --> 00:29:41.542
- Logan.

390
00:29:42.708 --> 00:29:45.375
I swear on my life. I saw a body

391
00:29:47.083 --> 00:29:48.083
right there.

392
00:29:49.208 --> 00:29:51.375
Just floating. motionless.

393
00:29:53.917 --> 00:29:58.208
- You're telling me you
saw a dead body in my pool?

394
00:30:00.708 --> 00:30:01.542
- Yeah.

395
00:30:02.583 --> 00:30:03.417
I mean.

396
00:30:05.542 --> 00:30:06.875
I thought I did.

397
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.542
I could just be scaring myself.

398
00:30:12.583 --> 00:30:13.667
- Who was it?

399
00:30:15.417 --> 00:30:17.917
I don't know. I couldn't tell.

400
00:30:19.333 --> 00:30:20.167
- Strange.

401
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.917
- [Nick] So what's been
going on with Flynn?

402
00:30:28.917 --> 00:30:30.583
- I have no idea.

403
00:30:30.583 --> 00:30:33.208
I'm not associating
with that schizophrenic.

404
00:30:33.208 --> 00:30:35.667
splatter-painting maniac.

405
00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:37.292
- What?

406
00:30:37.292 --> 00:30:39.042
Why? He's a good guy.

407
00:30:40.417 --> 00:30:44.958
- I don't doubt that but
have you not heard the story?

408
00:30:44.958 --> 00:30:47.167
- [Andrew] What story?

409
00:30:47.167 --> 00:30:48.500
- All right. look.

410
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.583
The man was institutionalized
his whole life.

411
00:30:50.583 --> 00:30:52.375
He gets out. a year later.

412
00:30:52.375 --> 00:30:56.250
his entire home burns down
and his whole family dies.

413
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.167
They say it was a coincidence.

414
00:30:59.167 --> 00:31:01.000
I don't really buy it.

415
00:31:02.292 --> 00:31:03.292
- Oh my god.

416
00:31:04.625 --> 00:31:05.958
That's terrible.

417
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.042
You got a cigarette?

418
00:31:10.042 --> 00:31:11.375
- [Arthur] Yeah.

419
00:31:28.792 --> 00:31:29.792
- Thank you.

420
00:31:33.333 --> 00:31:34.167
- So.

421
00:31:35.583 --> 00:31:39.333
Sleepwalker. I'm curious
how you came up with that.

422
00:31:39.333 --> 00:31:41.167
- That's a good question.

423
00:31:41.167 --> 00:31:43.500
I guess I just kinda see people

424
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.250
as these zombies
just kinda going

425
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.833
through the motions
every day. sleepwalking.

426
00:31:49.833 --> 00:31:52.917
I'd say I'm one of
those zombies too.

427
00:31:53.833 --> 00:31:55.500
- I can get to that.

428
00:31:56.333 --> 00:31:58.375
- What about you. Arthur?

429
00:32:01.042 --> 00:32:03.208
How'd you get into acting?

430
00:32:04.292 --> 00:32:06.000
- Like I said last night.

431
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
I've been doing this since
I was five years old.

432
00:32:12.083 --> 00:32:15.375
I guess it stems from my father.

433
00:32:15.375 --> 00:32:17.708
Let's just say he
was a loose cannon

434
00:32:17.708 --> 00:32:19.375
and when I was young.
my mother wanted

435
00:32:19.375 --> 00:32:22.042
to get me away from that
as much as possible.

436
00:32:22.042 --> 00:32:24.750
So when I was young. she signed
me up for acting classes.

437
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:29.042
I started doing that and
it's led me to this point.

438
00:32:31.292 --> 00:32:32.125
- Well.

439
00:32:33.208 --> 00:32:35.333
you've done pretty
damn well for yourself.

440
00:32:35.333 --> 00:32:38.042
You should be proud of that.

441
00:32:38.042 --> 00:32:40.208
- I guess I'm just scared.

442
00:32:41.375 --> 00:32:45.542
I'm scared that these
violent roles I portray

443
00:32:45.542 --> 00:32:48.500
are just slowly
turning me into him.

444
00:32:51.625 --> 00:32:53.417
- So why do you
think he chose us?

445
00:32:53.417 --> 00:32:57.250
I mean there's millions of
actors. directors. musicians.

446
00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.458
I don't get what
makes us so special.

447
00:33:00.458 --> 00:33:03.875
- 'Cause we're all
fucked up in the head.

448
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.917
(anxious piano music)

449
00:33:52.958 --> 00:33:56.750
(ominous electronic warbling)

450
00:34:29.125 --> 00:34:32.167
(tense violin tones)

451
00:34:54.333 --> 00:34:56.958
(glass tapping)

452
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.167
(upbeat country rock music)

453
00:35:22.083 --> 00:35:25.167
(mid tempo drumbeat)

454
00:36:31.292 --> 00:36:35.292
- I see you're not drinking.
which is admirable.

455
00:36:36.958 --> 00:36:38.792
But you gotta think.

456
00:36:38.792 --> 00:36:41.625
you're in a position most
people would kill for.

457
00:36:41.625 --> 00:36:44.042
You're at a beautiful home with

458
00:36:44.042 --> 00:36:45.958
one of the world's most
acclaimed directors

459
00:36:45.958 --> 00:36:48.625
and other successful
creators and yet.

460
00:36:48.625 --> 00:36:51.750
you seem to not be
enjoying yourself.

461
00:36:53.417 --> 00:36:55.125
- It's not that. it's

462
00:36:57.167 --> 00:37:01.292
just something happened
to me recently and

463
00:37:01.292 --> 00:37:04.958
I don't like not feeling
in control anymore.

464
00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:09.958
- No time for control.

465
00:37:12.292 --> 00:37:14.292
Beautiful day. isn't it?

466
00:37:15.458 --> 00:37:16.292
- Yes.

467
00:37:20.042 --> 00:37:23.875
(anxious piano. violin music)

468
00:38:04.667 --> 00:38:07.917
(tense metallic tones)

469
00:38:38.083 --> 00:38:40.917
- "Pulp Fiction's" overrated.

470
00:38:40.917 --> 00:38:44.208
- Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

471
00:38:44.208 --> 00:38:45.792
Look. you're a musician.

472
00:38:45.792 --> 00:38:47.625
I wouldn't expect
you to understand.

473
00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:51.042
But "Pulp Fiction" is
a stroke of genius.

474
00:38:52.417 --> 00:38:56.708
"Fight Club." Fight
Club." now that is a film.

475
00:38:56.708 --> 00:38:58.417
You could boast Tarkovsky
all the live long day

476
00:38:58.417 --> 00:39:02.250
if you want to but "Fight
Club" is prime cinema.

477
00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:05.750
- Honestly. one of the
worst movies I've ever seen.

478
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.208
- Your last album was garbage.

479
00:39:08.208 --> 00:39:09.833
- Are you fucking kidding me?

480
00:39:09.833 --> 00:39:11.333
Coming out to my
work. I literally had

481
00:39:11.333 --> 00:39:13.208
a number one on the billboard.
you know how hard that is?

482
00:39:13.208 --> 00:39:16.208
- I don't care. it's my opinion.

483
00:39:16.208 --> 00:39:17.042
- Nick.

484
00:39:20.042 --> 00:39:24.917
I don't know much about
you or where you come from.

485
00:39:24.917 --> 00:39:27.917
Tell me a little
bit about yourself.

486
00:39:29.125 --> 00:39:30.792
- I mean. honestly
not much to tell.

487
00:39:30.792 --> 00:39:33.250
I bounced around a lot as a kid.

488
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.375
Never really knew my dad

489
00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:37.292
but was always pretty
inspired by music.

490
00:39:37.292 --> 00:39:39.958
That was pretty
much my sanctuary.

491
00:39:39.958 --> 00:39:41.875
I made a band with my friends.

492
00:39:41.875 --> 00:39:43.958
I mean. got picked
up by a label.

493
00:39:43.958 --> 00:39:46.708
did some shows. saw
some success but

494
00:39:46.708 --> 00:39:50.542
eventually broke up 'cause
of creative differences.

495
00:39:50.542 --> 00:39:53.333
It's probably how I
lost all my friends but

496
00:39:53.333 --> 00:39:56.750
I mean. that's how it
goes when you're creative.

497
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:58.458
- You got a girl?
- No. I don't have a girl.

498
00:39:58.458 --> 00:40:00.458
But you know how
that story goes.

499
00:40:00.458 --> 00:40:03.833
Fucking everything
with a heartbeat.

500
00:40:03.833 --> 00:40:07.375
Honestly. I would
like a girl but

501
00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:10.167
I never really met one that
has good intentions. you know?

502
00:40:10.167 --> 00:40:12.667
I'm always on the road
meeting so many people.

503
00:40:12.667 --> 00:40:15.458
everyone just wants different
things and I don't know.

504
00:40:15.458 --> 00:40:17.167
I guess it's what comes
with the industry.

505
00:40:17.167 --> 00:40:18.958
comes with the job.

506
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:20.125
One day maybe.

507
00:40:22.375 --> 00:40:23.292
- There was

508
00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:25.625
once a story

509
00:40:27.375 --> 00:40:28.333
of a Saint.

510
00:40:31.208 --> 00:40:33.167
Saint Francis of Assisi.

511
00:40:35.875 --> 00:40:36.667
This man

512
00:40:37.583 --> 00:40:39.292
was a Prince.

513
00:40:39.292 --> 00:40:40.750
a partier.

514
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.542
an heir.

515
00:40:42.875 --> 00:40:44.250
One day. some say

516
00:40:46.167 --> 00:40:49.875
he heard the voice of
God speak into his ear.

517
00:40:51.792 --> 00:40:56.000
He gave up his old life
and occupied a new one.

518
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.667
One of simplicity.
one of purity.

519
00:41:03.042 --> 00:41:08.042
Later on. he underwent
an experience known
as the stigmata.

520
00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:11.375
otherwise known as
the wounds of Christ.

521
00:41:14.208 --> 00:41:17.083
To him. this was
not suffering. no.

522
00:41:18.417 --> 00:41:19.250
To him.

523
00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:21.958
this was ecstasy.

524
00:41:24.542 --> 00:41:26.250
Imagine the feeling.

525
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:29.833
Anyways.

526
00:41:31.292 --> 00:41:36.250
he went on to worship the
sun. the moon. the sands.

527
00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:40.917
He would save worms from roads
so they were not crushed.

528
00:41:45.083 --> 00:41:48.417
And he went on to
become the Great Saint.

529
00:41:50.208 --> 00:41:53.083
A beautiful story.
isn't it Arthur?

530
00:42:03.958 --> 00:42:05.375
- You up for a scrap?
- Yeah.

531
00:42:05.375 --> 00:42:07.042
Logan. tell us when.

532
00:42:12.917 --> 00:42:14.625
(tense metallic tones)

533
00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:15.458
- Fight.

534
00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:23.958
- Are you fucking kidding me?

535
00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:28.958
(thuds)
(tense spidery tones)

536
00:42:39.875 --> 00:42:41.375
- Arthur. what the fuck. man?

537
00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:44.208
You could have
fucking killed him.

538
00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:46.292
Dude. what?

539
00:42:46.292 --> 00:42:48.583
We have to fucking help him.

540
00:43:00.583 --> 00:43:01.417
- Ecstasy.

541
00:43:06.042 --> 00:43:07.000
- I gotcha.

542
00:43:12.417 --> 00:43:13.583
You all right?

543
00:43:19.167 --> 00:43:21.208
Come on. we're
going right there.

544
00:43:21.208 --> 00:43:24.542
(tense violin tones)

545
00:43:24.542 --> 00:43:27.500
(insects chirping)

546
00:43:35.375 --> 00:43:37.125
You'll be all right. okay?

547
00:43:37.125 --> 00:43:39.375
I'm gonna take care of you.

548
00:43:41.375 --> 00:43:43.042
Lay down right here.

549
00:43:45.542 --> 00:43:48.208
- Why are we by the pool?

550
00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:52.167
- We just gotta get away
from those guys for a second.

551
00:43:52.167 --> 00:43:54.917
You need anything?
- No. no.

552
00:43:54.917 --> 00:43:57.333
I'm just gonna sit here.
- Okay.

553
00:43:57.333 --> 00:43:58.667
You let me know.

554
00:43:59.542 --> 00:44:02.708
(anxious piano music)

555
00:44:18.125 --> 00:44:18.958
- Andrew.

556
00:44:21.208 --> 00:44:23.417
Something's not right here.

557
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.083
It's in the air.

558
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:30.250
- How do you mean?

559
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:36.917
- I paint because I
had loving parents

560
00:44:38.083 --> 00:44:41.750
who pushed me in the
direction of creativity.

561
00:44:43.792 --> 00:44:45.958
But there was always more.

562
00:44:48.583 --> 00:44:49.417
I dream

563
00:44:51.792 --> 00:44:54.417
and when I dream. I see things.

564
00:44:56.208 --> 00:44:59.500
- What kind of things?
- Horrible things.

565
00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:11.125
I once had a dream that my house

566
00:45:11.125 --> 00:45:14.458
was burning with my
family inside of it.

567
00:45:17.833 --> 00:45:20.250
I woke up to my house ablaze.

568
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.333
I was the only one
able to escape.

569
00:45:30.917 --> 00:45:33.250
I couldn't sleep for months.

570
00:45:34.667 --> 00:45:36.417
- That's terrible.

571
00:45:36.417 --> 00:45:37.833
I'm really sorry.

572
00:45:40.125 --> 00:45:41.792
- I changed my name.

573
00:45:43.333 --> 00:45:45.167
I occupied a new life.

574
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.833
One of purity.

575
00:45:48.833 --> 00:45:52.042
(anxious violin music)

576
00:45:57.333 --> 00:45:58.292
- You know.

577
00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:00.458
your art.

578
00:46:02.542 --> 00:46:04.875
it's so bright and colorful.

579
00:46:06.292 --> 00:46:10.208
I never would've known
you had such a dark past.

580
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.083
- The colors of fire and smoke.

581
00:46:20.292 --> 00:46:23.042
I had a dream
before I came here.

582
00:46:25.167 --> 00:46:26.542
I saw the doctor.

583
00:46:29.042 --> 00:46:30.208
I saw his mask

584
00:46:32.042 --> 00:46:32.875
here.

585
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.208
I don't know what it meant.

586
00:46:38.333 --> 00:46:40.542
I don't know what it means.

587
00:46:42.542 --> 00:46:44.375
but it was unsettling.

588
00:46:45.833 --> 00:46:47.875
- So you've seen him too.

589
00:46:49.958 --> 00:46:51.083
- He wanders.

590
00:46:52.917 --> 00:46:55.500
He's lurking. he's watching us.

591
00:46:57.625 --> 00:46:58.625
- Who is he?

592
00:47:00.292 --> 00:47:02.250
- [Flynn] I don't know.

593
00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.500
- Can I ask you a question?

594
00:47:10.333 --> 00:47:11.583
- [Flynn] Yeah.

595
00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:16.417
- You take medication?

596
00:47:19.583 --> 00:47:20.417
- I do.

597
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:26.167
- You think you should
be drinking on it?

598
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:28.083
- No.

599
00:47:30.375 --> 00:47:31.208
- Listen.

600
00:47:34.375 --> 00:47:36.792
I don't feel in control here.

601
00:47:39.125 --> 00:47:43.042
- There's no time
for control. Andrew.

602
00:47:43.042 --> 00:47:46.208
(anxious piano music)

603
00:48:14.708 --> 00:48:17.958
(glass clanks)

604
00:48:17.958 --> 00:48:20.292
- Quite the show you put on.

605
00:48:30.208 --> 00:48:32.667
- What are you talking about?

606
00:48:34.292 --> 00:48:36.875
(glass clanks)

607
00:48:41.792 --> 00:48:43.333
I don't understand.

608
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:49.750
I don't understand what
happens when I'm here tomorrow

609
00:48:50.833 --> 00:48:53.417
and this new project
becomes mine.

610
00:48:55.458 --> 00:48:58.500
- You just gotta
be patient. okay?

611
00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.667
(Arthur's fists thud)

612
00:49:04.458 --> 00:49:05.958
- I'm not patient.

613
00:49:07.208 --> 00:49:09.208
I've never been patient.

614
00:49:15.708 --> 00:49:17.042
How do I get it?

615
00:49:20.375 --> 00:49:24.208
- That you gotta find
out for yourself.

616
00:49:24.208 --> 00:49:28.125
The movies you're in are
pretty violent. right?

617
00:49:31.042 --> 00:49:33.500
A lot of training. I presume?

618
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.792
It's funny. the more
real the violence

619
00:49:38.792 --> 00:49:42.458
looks on screen. the
more audiences respond.

620
00:49:43.792 --> 00:49:47.625
It's interesting because
if it were to be real

621
00:49:49.083 --> 00:49:52.750
and an audience just
believed it was staged.

622
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:57.417
they would applaud. unbeknownst
to its haunting reality.

623
00:50:03.417 --> 00:50:06.583
- You have to be
psychotic to do that.

624
00:50:08.708 --> 00:50:10.958
- The greatest usually are.

625
00:50:13.708 --> 00:50:16.750
(low. anxious tones)

626
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:37.292
(tense violin tones)

627
00:50:45.958 --> 00:50:48.958
Andrew. sit down
and keep me company.

628
00:50:56.625 --> 00:50:58.208
Where is everybody?

629
00:50:59.667 --> 00:51:03.125
- I think Flynn and
Arthur went to bed

630
00:51:03.125 --> 00:51:05.792
and Nick is resting by the pool.

631
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.792
It's been a long day.

632
00:51:09.667 --> 00:51:11.125
- I would say so.

633
00:51:14.833 --> 00:51:17.042
I've been thinking a lot.

634
00:51:17.042 --> 00:51:20.125
What do you know
about astral travel?

635
00:51:21.417 --> 00:51:22.917
- Astral travel?

636
00:51:22.917 --> 00:51:27.125
- Yeah. like a person
leaving their physical body

637
00:51:27.125 --> 00:51:31.542
and traveling the universe
in any way they so choose.

638
00:51:32.667 --> 00:51:35.083
- I mean I've heard of it but

639
00:51:37.917 --> 00:51:41.458
I don't really
know much about it.

640
00:51:41.458 --> 00:51:43.833
- You know how
there's no evidence.

641
00:51:43.833 --> 00:51:46.958
scientific evidence
of the human soul?

642
00:51:48.292 --> 00:51:51.042
But I think it's so
ignorant to think

643
00:51:51.042 --> 00:51:53.333
we're just here to multiply.

644
00:51:55.708 --> 00:52:00.375
You know. we are the eyes of
the universe watching itself

645
00:52:04.208 --> 00:52:05.375
and sometimes.

646
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.375
you don't like what you find.

647
00:52:14.875 --> 00:52:18.042
You know. I know
what happened to you.

648
00:52:19.875 --> 00:52:20.708
- What?

649
00:52:26.417 --> 00:52:29.625
- I didn't feel comfortable
talking to you about it

650
00:52:29.625 --> 00:52:33.042
but we had a good day
today and I figured

651
00:52:34.375 --> 00:52:37.542
you can tell me a
little bit about it.

652
00:52:40.375 --> 00:52:44.375
How about you take a drink
and tell me about it?

653
00:52:47.917 --> 00:52:49.958
- If you know what
happened to me.

654
00:52:49.958 --> 00:52:53.750
then why would you ask
me if I wanted a drink?

655
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:59.333
- Take a drink and tell
me about it. Andrew.

656
00:53:02.125 --> 00:53:02.958
- Okay.

657
00:53:20.917 --> 00:53:24.417
So I went down to
Dallas where she worked.

658
00:53:27.042 --> 00:53:30.458
She wanted to introduce
me to her friends

659
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:32.833
and

660
00:53:34.833 --> 00:53:39.125
so we went out and I was
the one driving that night

661
00:53:43.292 --> 00:53:47.250
and she asked me right
before we got in the car

662
00:53:49.667 --> 00:53:51.625
if I was good to drive.

663
00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:57.667
I said yes

664
00:53:57.667 --> 00:54:01.500
(ominous electronic warbling)

665
00:54:02.667 --> 00:54:05.333
and I put the key
in the ignition.

666
00:54:08.542 --> 00:54:11.875
That was the biggest
mistake of my life.

667
00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:15.000
You know what happens next.

668
00:54:17.083 --> 00:54:18.083
- You killed

669
00:54:19.792 --> 00:54:20.792
your sister.

670
00:54:22.417 --> 00:54:25.333
(Andrew sniffling)

671
00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:40.792
It's all right.

672
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.708
It's all right. I'm
going to sleep now. okay?

673
00:54:50.792 --> 00:54:52.875
Have a good night. Atlas.

674
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.375
(insects chirping)

675
00:55:09.417 --> 00:55:12.583
(anxious piano music)

676
00:55:36.917 --> 00:55:41.917
(Nick splashes)
(tense violin tones)

677
00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:23.500
- We have to call the cops.

678
00:56:26.625 --> 00:56:29.333
- We don't need
to call the cops.

679
00:56:31.167 --> 00:56:32.000
Nick

680
00:56:33.167 --> 00:56:36.583
was a druggie. I found
heroin in his bags.

681
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.125
He was high and he fell into
the pool and he drowned.

682
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.833
He was an artist on the run.

683
00:56:47.833 --> 00:56:49.250
He had no family.

684
00:56:50.958 --> 00:56:55.125
Careers will be ruined if
police were to get involved.

685
00:56:55.125 --> 00:57:00.042
if press were to get involved
and none of us here want that.

686
00:57:01.083 --> 00:57:03.250
This weekend was a secret.

687
00:57:05.083 --> 00:57:06.750
It remains a secret.

688
00:57:09.667 --> 00:57:11.167
It does not exist.

689
00:57:13.208 --> 00:57:16.125
You will all
understand by the end.

690
00:57:18.125 --> 00:57:19.208
Okay. Andrew?

691
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:23.083
- Okay.

692
00:57:24.458 --> 00:57:25.292
- Arthur?

693
00:57:26.333 --> 00:57:27.167
- Yeah.

694
00:57:30.083 --> 00:57:30.917
- Flynn?

695
00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:34.750
Flynn?

696
00:57:36.208 --> 00:57:37.042
- Yeah.

697
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.208
- There are shovels in the shed.

698
00:57:41.208 --> 00:57:42.208
We bury him.

699
00:57:47.167 --> 00:57:51.167
(tense metallic ensemble music)

700
00:58:11.208 --> 00:58:14.458
(ominous violin music)

701
00:58:44.125 --> 00:58:45.375
Good work. men.

702
00:58:46.917 --> 00:58:49.292
Let's go back to the pool.

703
00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:50.375
Drinks on me.

704
00:59:00.958 --> 00:59:03.917
(shovels clanking)

705
00:59:09.125 --> 00:59:11.375
- What have we done. Flynn?

706
00:59:16.125 --> 00:59:18.000
- [Flynn] Where are we?

707
00:59:23.833 --> 00:59:25.083
Where's Arthur?

708
00:59:26.917 --> 00:59:28.500
- You feeling okay?

709
00:59:35.583 --> 00:59:37.333
- I had another dream

710
00:59:38.667 --> 00:59:39.625
last night.

711
00:59:41.875 --> 00:59:43.875
The one with my parents.

712
00:59:48.375 --> 00:59:51.667
But it was me who
burnt the house down.

713
00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:58.167
That is why I survived.

714
01:00:01.458 --> 01:00:02.958
- That's not real.

715
01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:12.792
- [Flynn] I don't know
what's real. Andrew.

716
01:00:12.792 --> 01:00:14.208
I don't remember.

717
01:00:31.083 --> 01:00:34.500
(tense metallic music)

718
01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.958
(door creaks)

719
01:02:08.083 --> 01:02:11.833
(heartbeat pounding rapidly)

720
01:02:54.042 --> 01:02:57.042
(Flynn grunting)

721
01:02:57.042 --> 01:03:01.875
(tense warbling
electronic. violin tones)

722
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:34.042
(ominous violin tones)

723
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:39.917
- Who are you?

724
01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:43.917
What are you doing to us?

725
01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:14.625
(door creaks)
(tense metallic music)

726
01:04:50.125 --> 01:04:51.875
Flynn. are you out here?

727
01:04:51.875 --> 01:04:54.667
Come on man. we
gotta go right now.

728
01:04:54.667 --> 01:04:55.500
Flynn?

729
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.167
(tense warbling
electronic tones)

730
01:05:02.208 --> 01:05:03.500
Oh shit. Flynn.

731
01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:10.958
Arthur. what have you done?

732
01:05:10.958 --> 01:05:13.875
Don't you know he's
done something to us?

733
01:05:13.875 --> 01:05:15.542
You're not yourself.

734
01:05:17.458 --> 01:05:21.542
(tense metallic. warbling music)

735
01:05:42.125 --> 01:05:44.917
(light tense piano tones)

736
01:05:44.917 --> 01:05:47.250
(gun cocks)

737
01:05:50.042 --> 01:05:52.667
(gun clicks)

738
01:05:52.667 --> 01:05:55.333
(Arthur grunts)

739
01:06:39.625 --> 01:06:42.583
(gun cocks)

740
01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:47.583
(classical violin music)
(film reel rattling)

741
01:07:28.292 --> 01:07:30.458
What the hell is going on?

742
01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:35.000
- Why don't you
put down the gun?

743
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.875
I'm not gonna hurt you.

744
01:07:36.875 --> 01:07:39.833
- Hurt me. you're
not gonna hurt me?

745
01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:41.833
I'll fucking shoot you right now

746
01:07:41.833 --> 01:07:44.833
if you don't tell
me what's going on.

747
01:07:44.833 --> 01:07:45.792
- Allow me.

748
01:07:47.208 --> 01:07:49.458
It's called HEIR.

749
01:07:49.458 --> 01:07:51.292
H-E-I-R.

750
01:07:55.500 --> 01:08:00.125
In 1800s France. there was a
man named Josephin Paillat.

751
01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:06.375
He began an Academy.
one that worshiped art.

752
01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:11.375
There is spirituality
in what we do.

753
01:08:13.917 --> 01:08:17.833
Religion will die. but
art will remain forever.

754
01:08:19.708 --> 01:08:22.416
When churches burn
and temples crumble.

755
01:08:22.416 --> 01:08:25.875
we will praise in
the concert hall.

756
01:08:25.875 --> 01:08:29.416
When priests betray
and idols become human.

757
01:08:32.833 --> 01:08:37.833
we will pray to the ones who
give us stories and songs.

758
01:08:38.708 --> 01:08:40.291
This is our fate. Andrew.

759
01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:43.541
- What are you talking about?

760
01:08:44.708 --> 01:08:47.666
- What many don't know is that

761
01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:51.666
the Academy is the reason
for pop culture today.

762
01:08:53.125 --> 01:08:57.833
The most influential artworks
and films have been curated

763
01:08:59.916 --> 01:09:03.500
in order to choreograph
modern day thought.

764
01:09:05.208 --> 01:09:07.708
The world has been hypnotized.

765
01:09:08.583 --> 01:09:09.416
You. here.

766
01:09:11.416 --> 01:09:13.125
have been hypnotized.

767
01:09:14.625 --> 01:09:18.916
- So the vial in your
bedroom. that's what that is.

768
01:09:20.458 --> 01:09:24.375
- Like those who came
before me. I have learned

769
01:09:25.625 --> 01:09:26.791
about hypnosis

770
01:09:28.208 --> 01:09:30.000
and I needed a
little extra help.

771
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.083
It's called scipolomi.

772
01:09:32.083 --> 01:09:35.416
it gives the taker a
sense of obedience.

773
01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:39.958
I wanted to gather the
greatest creative minds

774
01:09:39.958 --> 01:09:44.958
at the zenith of their lives
to see what they would do.

775
01:09:45.875 --> 01:09:47.500
You were the most repellent

776
01:09:48.333 --> 01:09:49.958
because of your mind.

777
01:09:49.958 --> 01:09:54.125
you survived because of
the strength of your mind.

778
01:09:56.291 --> 01:10:00.541
There is no escaping the
hypnosis for the ordinary.

779
01:10:01.916 --> 01:10:04.125
It's in the films you watch.
in the books you read.

780
01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:08.291
in the art you're moved
by and the songs you love.

781
01:10:10.416 --> 01:10:12.958
Some like me just
know how to use it

782
01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:15.625
to orchestrate it. to create it.

783
01:10:19.291 --> 01:10:22.541
This script in my
hand is the next link

784
01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:27.500
in a century-long
chain of true hypnotic.

785
01:10:29.416 --> 01:10:30.583
spiritual art.

786
01:10:32.791 --> 01:10:34.041
And it's yours.

787
01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:38.000
- Why don't you make it?

788
01:10:38.916 --> 01:10:40.875
- I haven't been chosen.

789
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:43.875
The Academy

790
01:10:45.166 --> 01:10:46.000
wants you.

791
01:10:47.041 --> 01:10:48.000
your vision.

792
01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:50.125
not mine.

793
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:55.166
- What is it even about?

794
01:10:55.166 --> 01:10:57.625
(anxious violin music)

795
01:10:57.625 --> 01:11:00.291
Tell me. what is the film about?

796
01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:05.166
- It's a beautiful gun
in your hand. isn't it?

797
01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:07.875
- Yes.

798
01:11:10.291 --> 01:11:11.125
- Please.

799
01:11:12.541 --> 01:11:14.458
(anxious piano music)

800
01:11:14.458 --> 01:11:17.125
(gunshot booms)

801
01:12:30.791 --> 01:12:33.791
(keyboard clicking)

802
01:13:29.291 --> 01:13:32.458
(anxious piano music)
