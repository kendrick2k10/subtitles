(switch clicks)

20
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.467
- Sure no one lives here?

21
00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:16.904
(Jack scoffs)

(Drew blows)

25
00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:45.266
- Doesn't look
like they returned.

26
00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:53.741
Don't you think she
looks like Candice?

27
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.143
- (chuckles) Nah.

28
00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:58.145
Do you remember Caroline?

29
00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:00.080
- Do I remember Caroline?

30
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.383
Does Caroline remember
me? That's the question.

31
00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:04.184
(men chuckle)

32
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:07.321
- So. how long do you
think we can crash here?

33
00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:10.424
- I don't know.

34
00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:11.459
Days?

35
00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.393
Weeks?

36
00:03:14.362 --> 00:03:16.630
- (scoffs) After what happened?

37
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.199
I guess if they were
gonna come back.

38
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.270
whoever owned this place.
they would've done by now.

39
00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.374
- Wait. I don't get it.

40
00:03:26.374 --> 00:03:27.908
What actually went down here?

41
00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.511
- I'm not entirely sure. either.

42
00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.548
But about a decade ago.
there was some kind of

43
00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:36.216
nuclear contamination.

44
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.920
- So everyone just
picked up and left?

45
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.853
- Pretty much.

46
00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.591
I mean. you couldn't stay here.

47
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.728
They said that they didn't
have time to pick up

48
00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.930
what they had before they left.

49
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.764
- Christ.

50
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.436
People just had to
start afresh someplace.

51
00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:59.172
- Well. you couldn't stay here.

52
00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:01.041
I mean. that was
out of the question.

53
00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:03.644
It's only about a year or so ago

54
00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:06.314
that they authorized
people to come back.

55
00:04:06.314 --> 00:04:08.782
- Well. I guess if you have
started a new life elsewhere-

56
00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:10.017
- [Drew] They you wouldn't
be coming back here.

57
00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:11.485
would you. Jack?

58
00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:12.320
- Yeah.

59
00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:17.757
- Hey.

60
00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:22.896
How long do you think
until your momma realizes

61
00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:25.132
that you're not in
bed all tucked up?

62
00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:29.069
- I give her a whole hour.

63
00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:30.371
Eyes like a hawk.

64
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:34.608
- And what do you
think she'll say

65
00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.409
if she knew you were here?

66
00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.778
- (chuckles) She'd freak.

67
00:04:40.448 --> 00:04:43.351
- What about if she
knew you were drinking?

68
00:04:44.552 --> 00:04:45.919
What if she saw me do that?

69
00:04:48.756 --> 00:04:53.126
- You're terrible.
(Drew chuckles)

70
00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.828
- And what if she
saw me do this?

71
00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:09.343
Well I guess you already did
it. so. she couldn't say much.

72
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.611
- Mm.

73
00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:14.047
You wanna go upstairs?

74
00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:17.651
- Yeah.

75
00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:20.954
- (sighs) Sure.

76
00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:24.892
- Sweet.

77
00:05:26.694 --> 00:05:30.831
(moody synth-pop music)

78
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:34.334
(Natalie pants and moans)

79
00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:45.245
* The lights went black
in the dead sea harem *

80
00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:50.250
* Winds sweep up through
the halls but yet no sound *

81
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:54.354
* And the temperature's down

82
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.689
* And it's darker now

83
00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:00.661
(Natalie moans and pants)
(Jack pants)

84
00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.700
(Jack grunts)

85
00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:13.040
* The souls of the harem
moving to the door *

86

(Natalie moans)
(Jack grunts and pants)

87
00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:20.448
* Where a demon now stands
there. 10 feet tall *

88
00:06:20.448 --> 00:06:23.851
(Jack grunts and pants)

89
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:28.556
* As he stares in the darkness
with his smile driven back *

90
00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:32.058
* So simmer down

91
00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:35.328
* This is feeding town

92
00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.916
(Drew grunts)
(Natalie moans)

93
00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.986
- I'm gonna get something
to drink. Enjoy.

(breathes deeply)

103
00:07:34.488 --> 00:07:36.056
Hey.

104
00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:38.125
That was pretty kinky. right?

105
00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:40.159
Losing it to two guys
in your first time?

106
00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:42.229
- Yeah.

107
00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:47.267
- Yeah?

108
00:07:50.838 --> 00:07:52.873
- It wasn't as bad as I thought.

109
00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:55.207
- Right.

110
00:07:56.343 --> 00:07:57.177
Okay.

111
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.748
- As in. it wasn't intimidating.

112
00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:05.318
(Drew chuckles)

113
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:08.689
- Hey. imagine if your mom
knew that you just lost it.

114
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.292
- You really love
talking about my mom.

115
00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:15.896
- Yeah.

116
00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:16.730
Well...

117
00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:21.134
See. I always kinda had a
crush on her. back at school.

118
00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:25.505
She taught me English.
(clicks tongue)

119
00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.608
- Please tell me that's
not why I'm here.

120
00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:34.081
- I'm gonna go freshen up.

121
00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.419

* You raise to the stars

143
00:10:50.718 --> 00:10:53.020

- I'll go back to
the city in an hour.

175
00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:16.023
I'll get out of your hair.

176
00:14:17.424 --> 00:14:20.527
- Well. we were gonna
ask and see if you wanted

177
00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.830
to spend a little more time
with your family. at home.

178
00:14:31.438 --> 00:14:34.474
Your sister just got
back from her friends and

179
00:14:34.474 --> 00:14:35.976
Grandma needs us.

180
00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:40.647
And I don't want you going
back to the big city so soon.

181
00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:42.882
Not after...

182
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.618
- You can say his name. Mom.

183
00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:46.553
He existed.

184
00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:50.290
- After Matty.

185
00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:57.664
I talked to your college

186
00:14:57.664 --> 00:15:00.000
and they're fine if you
wanna sit the year out.

187
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.868
and you can start up next year.

188
00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:10.710
Hey.

189
00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:12.980
Look who it is.

190
00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:14.847
- Hello. darling.

191
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.185
- Hey. Grandma.

192
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:24.591
- I'm gonna leave you two
to it. while I go pack.

193
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.425
Alright?

194
00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.763
(door creaks)

195
00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:49.549
- Where are we going?

196
00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:51.518
- My old place
down at the ranch.

197
00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:53.753
Some people have
broken in. apparently.

198
00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:54.988
Slumming it down there.

199
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:57.890
- The place where Dad grew up?

200
00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:01.728
- I could've moved
back in some time ago

201
00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:04.831
but I could never
find the right time.

202
00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:06.466
But then you know
what I thought?

203
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.371
Grandpa may not be alive any
more. but he's alive in here.

204
00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:15.108
My memories of him
can keep him alive.

205
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:18.711
So even though I need
to go back to a place

206
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:21.648
filled with happy memories.

207
00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:25.185
for me. it can still
be a happy place.

208
00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:27.754
Because I can remember
all the good times

209
00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:32.292
and stop focusing
on how it ended.

210
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.128
And so can you.

211
00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:40.633
I was so very sorry.
Jamie. to hear about Matty.

212
00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:41.701
Really. I was.

213
00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:46.139
But you need to remember
you were lucky to have him.

214
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.675
Even for that brief time.

215
00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:54.114
You experienced real love. and
that is something many people

216
00:16:54.114 --> 00:16:56.183
never have in their whole lives.

217
00:16:58.418 --> 00:17:00.053
I got you today. you hear me?

218
00:17:01.488 --> 00:17:04.290
And I need you to be having
me when I'm finding it rough.

219
00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:09.596
I haven't been back to
that place in years.

220
00:17:11.064 --> 00:17:14.233
I need you today just
as much as you need me.

221
00:17:21.608 --> 00:17:22.608
- I got you.

222
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.618
- I'm so sorry.

223
00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.465
(melancholy music)

224
00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:22.535
- [Lisa] Hey. Uh-uh.
honey. get in the back.

225
00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:23.836
- Yeah.

226
00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:27.274
(upbeat synth-pop music)

227
00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:40.847
(strong wind blows)
(ominous tones swell)

228
00:19:41.448 --> 00:19:43.850
(eerie music)

229
00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:48.821
(bat shrieks)

230
00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:06.973
(gate rattles)

231
00:20:29.028 --> 00:20:30.830
Are you okay?

232
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.664
- I'm okay.

233
00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:36.269
(sighs)

234
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.173
(dissonant eerie music)

235
00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:58.425
(can sprays)

236
00:21:01.394 --> 00:21:03.830
(Lisa sighs)

237
00:21:05.832 --> 00:21:08.000
(Lisa sighs and groans)

238
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.703
- The smell in this
place. (chuckles)

239
00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:12.439
It's like someone died.

240
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.675
(sighs)

241
00:21:15.675 --> 00:21:20.112
Amelia. you haven't said a
word to her since you got back.

242
00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.614
- That's not true.

243
00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:22.649
I said "hi."

244
00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:26.853
Mom!

245
00:21:26.853 --> 00:21:28.955
I don't know how to
talk to her right now.

246
00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:30.690
- She's your sister!

247
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.725
Talk to her how
you usually would.

248
00:21:33.893 --> 00:21:35.995
- Yeah. but I just
find it awkward.

249
00:21:37.864 --> 00:21:39.732
- She needs us.

250
00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:40.567
Go on.

251
00:21:43.169 --> 00:21:43.970
- Fine.

252
00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:47.073
(footsteps clack)

253
00:21:47.073 --> 00:21:49.442
(can sprays)

254
00:21:54.747 --> 00:21:55.548
- God damn.

255
00:21:58.418 --> 00:22:00.119
- It's weird being here. huh?

256
00:22:01.588 --> 00:22:02.422
- Sure is.

257
00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:06.225
- Wanna go for a walk?

258
00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:11.063
- Okay.

259
00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:14.000
- Okay. (chuckles)

260
00:22:21.107 --> 00:22:23.510
(door slams)

261
00:22:24.877 --> 00:22:26.145
In case we get bored.

262
00:22:27.313 --> 00:22:28.715
- You don't even
have your license.

263
00:22:28.715 --> 00:22:30.116
- So?

264
00:22:30.116 --> 00:22:31.684
I drive Dad's truck around.

265
00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:34.286
What's a little car?

266
00:22:34.286 --> 00:22:36.523
(chuckles)

267
00:22:40.627 --> 00:22:43.563
- Here's the coffee.
after all these years.

268
00:22:43.563 --> 00:22:44.897
- (chuckles) Uh-uh.

269
00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:47.934
You can't be drinking
that. Not now.

270
00:22:47.934 --> 00:22:50.403
- Well. why not? Coffee
is just mold anyway.

271
00:22:50.403 --> 00:22:52.872
True fact. Mold grows
on coffee beans.

272
00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:55.742
Now you can't get much
moldier than mold itself.

273
00:22:55.742 --> 00:22:57.677
- I'll tell you what
smells like mold.

274
00:22:57.677 --> 00:22:59.579
This house!

275
00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:01.614
It reeks of death.

276
00:23:01.614 --> 00:23:03.783
(sighs)

277
00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:06.018
I need to spray something.

278
00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:08.220
(can sprays)
(groans)

279
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.657
(dark music)

280
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.571
- You know. I feel like
we've barely spoken.

281
00:23:27.306 --> 00:23:28.541
- Yeah. Same.

282
00:23:30.843 --> 00:23:33.012
- You do know that you
can just pick up the phone

283
00:23:33.012 --> 00:23:35.381
and call me. like
at any time. right?

284
00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:38.250
Yeah.

285
00:23:41.788 --> 00:23:44.323
- So. um. how've
you been holding up?

286
00:23:45.525 --> 00:23:47.560
- Yeah. I'm fine. You know.

287
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.596
Just gotta keep
moving on with life.

288
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.431
- Well. yeah. but (chuckles)

289
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.834
you don't just have
to move on. you know?

290
00:23:54.834 --> 00:23:56.803
These things. they take time.

291
00:23:56.803 --> 00:23:58.971
It's not just gonna
happen overnight.

292
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:01.841
You gotta just let
yourself let him go. okay?

293
00:24:01.841 --> 00:24:03.643
- Yeah. I am doing that.

294
00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:11.450
- Okay. (chuckles)

295
00:24:12.485 --> 00:24:13.285
- What's that?

296
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.659
(somber music)

297
00:24:19.659 --> 00:24:20.493
Come on.

298
00:24:45.552 --> 00:24:47.820
(Rich chuckles)

299
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.221
- So!

300
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:51.023
You wanna show me
your old bedroom?

301
00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:51.891
- Oh. God.

302
00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:53.960
Alright. this way.

303
00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:59.666
(ominous music)

304
00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:09.542
(door opens)

305
00:25:09.542 --> 00:25:12.211
Oh. god. (chuckles)

306
00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:13.512
- Wow.

307
00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:14.947
- I know. right?

308
00:25:14.947 --> 00:25:16.916
- Oh. my god.

309
00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:19.686
Well. the decor is
definitely your mom's choice.

310
00:25:19.686 --> 00:25:21.187
- You think?

311
00:25:21.187 --> 00:25:22.789
- It's a little
bit girly. honey.

312
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:25.592
- Yeah. I kinda think
she always wanted a girl

313
00:25:25.592 --> 00:25:29.061
and this is her payback
at me for not being one.

314
00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:31.898
(both chuckle)

315
00:25:31.898 --> 00:25:34.266
- Oh. my god!
- Oh. no.

316
00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:35.868
I know. right? (chuckles)

317
00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:37.069
- [Lisa] You poor thing.

318
00:25:38.104 --> 00:25:40.573
- Look at the hair! (laughs)

319
00:25:40.573 --> 00:25:43.075
Oh. I worked so hard. (laughs)

320
00:25:43.075 --> 00:25:46.779
- Well. baby. we all
had bad hair back then.

321
00:25:46.779 --> 00:25:47.980
- Oh.

322
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.016
Imagine meeting
this boy in a club.

323
00:25:51.417 --> 00:25:52.218
- Yeah.

324
00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.286
I'd run a mile.

325
00:25:55.487 --> 00:25:57.556
- That's probably a
good idea. (laughs)

326
00:25:57.556 --> 00:25:59.391
He'd run. too. He was so shy.

327
00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:01.928
(both laugh)

328
00:26:01.928 --> 00:26:02.962
Aw. Jesus.

329
00:26:04.764 --> 00:26:08.267
- What happened after you
got told you had to leave?

330
00:26:08.267 --> 00:26:12.371
- (sighs) I don't
really remember it.
if I'm being honest.

331
00:26:12.371 --> 00:26:13.973
I mean...

332
00:26:13.973 --> 00:26:16.843
I remember Mom being like. "we
need to pack up and leave."

333
00:26:16.843 --> 00:26:19.812
Dad was in a real big rush.
all the locals were leaving

334
00:26:19.812 --> 00:26:23.115
and it was just a big disaster.

335
00:26:23.115 --> 00:26:24.651
We had to evacuate.

336
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:26.218
- (sighs) Christ.

337
00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:28.888
(sighs)

338
00:26:28.888 --> 00:26:29.722
- Jesus.

339
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.793
- You think Jamie blames us?

340
00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:37.730
For what happened. with Matty?

341
00:26:40.733 --> 00:26:42.902
- I mean. it was an accident.

342
00:26:42.902 --> 00:26:45.204
There's not really much
more we could've done.

343
00:26:46.138 --> 00:26:47.506
- I just keep thinking.

344
00:26:48.775 --> 00:26:51.878
If I had gone that
night instead of him...

345
00:26:51.878 --> 00:26:54.546
- No use thinking like
this. What have I told you?

346
00:26:55.715 --> 00:26:57.984
She's gonna need
us to support her.

347
00:26:57.984 --> 00:27:00.653
She's gonna struggle
for quite a while.

348
00:27:00.653 --> 00:27:02.188
She needs us to be level-headed.

349
00:27:02.188 --> 00:27:05.224
We can't be filling her
mind with what-ifs. alright?

350
00:27:07.026 --> 00:27:08.828
None of this is on you.

351
00:27:10.663 --> 00:27:12.732
(kisses)

352
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.805
(Lisa sighs)

353
00:27:18.805 --> 00:27:21.908
(birds tweet)

354
00:27:21.908 --> 00:27:24.911
- [Amelia] (sighs) Are you
gonna remember how to get back?

355
00:27:24.911 --> 00:27:25.745
- Yeah.

356
00:27:27.513 --> 00:27:29.581
(eerie music)

357
00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:31.718
- So. (chuckles)
what's the plan?

358
00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:36.789
- Doesn't look like
there's anyone inside.

359
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:39.625
(Amelia chuckles)

360
00:28:00.847 --> 00:28:02.648
(chuckles)

361
00:28:02.648 --> 00:28:03.549
- Oh. my god.

362
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:10.522
(door creaks)

363
00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:11.357
- Hello?

364
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.575
Hey.

365
00:28:29.575 --> 00:28:32.578
(music intensifies)

366
00:28:36.382 --> 00:28:37.383
What's that?

367
00:28:41.153 --> 00:28:43.890
(crickets chirp)

368
00:28:53.132 --> 00:28:55.067
(bag rustles)

369
00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:57.736
(bottles clink)

370
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:09.115
- Weird. (chuckles)

371
00:29:10.516 --> 00:29:11.984
- Do we know how long
they were squatting here?

372
00:29:11.984 --> 00:29:14.887
- From the looks of
things. not very long.

373
00:29:14.887 --> 00:29:17.656
- (chuckles) Hey. Ma.
Recognize this guy?

374
00:29:17.656 --> 00:29:18.757
(Lisa chuckles)

375
00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.927
- Aw. that's fun.

376
00:29:20.927 --> 00:29:22.661
There must be some
more of those upstairs.

377
00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:24.163
- Oh. please!

378
00:29:24.163 --> 00:29:27.433
I would love to see some baby
pictures. if you have them.

379
00:29:27.433 --> 00:29:28.667
- [Rick] God. she's been
wanting to see those

380
00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:30.136
since we first met.

381
00:29:30.136 --> 00:29:33.339
- Oh. I wanna see you as a
baby. you're so cute! Why not?

382
00:29:33.339 --> 00:29:35.274
(giggles)

383
00:29:35.274 --> 00:29:37.609
- Well. there must be
some more up in the attic.

384
00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.478
There's bits and
photo albums up there.

385
00:29:39.478 --> 00:29:40.947
I'll go up and have a check.

386
00:29:40.947 --> 00:29:43.582
- Oh. we could have an
evening of show and tell.

387
00:29:43.582 --> 00:29:45.217
- (sighs) Sweet!

388
00:29:45.217 --> 00:29:46.452
Sounds great.

389
00:29:46.452 --> 00:29:47.854
(Lisa laughs)

390
00:29:47.854 --> 00:29:50.156
- I'll try not to embarrass
you too much. honey.

391
00:29:50.156 --> 00:29:51.423
- Sure. Thanks. Mom.

392
00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:54.927
One word about my haircut again.

393
00:29:54.927 --> 00:29:56.695
and that's it. marriage over.

394
00:29:56.695 --> 00:29:57.596
We're done!

395
00:29:57.596 --> 00:29:59.798
- (laughs) Oh. sweetie.

396
00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:01.633
(yelps)

397
00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:02.801
I love you. honey.
- I love you.

398
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.938
- [Jamie] How's college?

399
00:30:05.938 --> 00:30:07.974
- Oh. you know. Same old.

400
00:30:10.877 --> 00:30:12.544
- You gonna change your studies?

401
00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:15.047
- No. it's not
that. it's just...

402
00:30:15.047 --> 00:30:17.549
Well. you know. gonna
actually have to figure out

403
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:19.018
what I wanna do when I leave.

404
00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:30.662
It's so strange that
nobody came back here.

405
00:30:32.698 --> 00:30:34.200
- Yeah. but when
you got a new life.

406
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.734
what've you got to return to?

407
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.675
(switch clicks)

408
00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:54.553
(breathes heavily and shakily)

409
00:30:58.224 --> 00:30:59.025
- Jamie?

410
00:31:01.027 --> 00:31:02.929
Jamie. what's going on?

411
00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:08.134
(Jamie sobs)

412
00:31:08.134 --> 00:31:08.968
Jamie?

413
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:10.869
Jamie. what's wrong?

414
00:31:12.271 --> 00:31:13.405
- Nothing. I'm fine.

415
00:31:13.405 --> 00:31:14.974
- It's not fine
though. is it? Tell me.

416
00:31:14.974 --> 00:31:16.808
- Look. I'm fine!
- Jamie!

417
00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:18.477
Look at me!

418
00:31:18.477 --> 00:31:19.411
Hey.

419
00:31:19.411 --> 00:31:20.879
Look.

420
00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:23.582
I know that we haven't spoke
much. but listen to me.

421
00:31:23.582 --> 00:31:24.750
You're still my sister.

422
00:31:25.952 --> 00:31:27.586
It's okay.

423
00:31:27.586 --> 00:31:29.721
It's okay. I love you. okay?

424
00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:30.556
I'm your sister.

425
00:31:31.423 --> 00:31:32.724
- [Jamie] I said I'm fine.

426
00:31:37.196 --> 00:31:39.531
- This is not like you
at all. What's going on?

427
00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:46.872
- I don't know. sometimes
I just get anxious

428
00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:47.940
and I freak out a bit.

429
00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:56.048
I know it's all in
my head. it's just...

430
00:31:56.048 --> 00:31:57.049
It's all in my head.

431
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.324
But I don't want to move on

432
00:32:05.324 --> 00:32:07.126
because I don't
wanna forget him.

433
00:32:10.462 --> 00:32:12.031
And I'm just...

434
00:32:12.031 --> 00:32:14.166
And I'm worried that
I'm gonna forget him.

435
00:32:15.601 --> 00:32:17.269
And I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life

436
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:20.806
comparing everyone
that I meet to...

437
00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:24.276
Him.

438
00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:25.544
- Hey.

439
00:32:25.544 --> 00:32:29.281
Hey. Jamie. look at me.
Look at me. Jamie. okay?

440
00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:32.484
It's okay. It's okay.
just let it out. yeah?

441
00:32:32.484 --> 00:32:34.186
It's okay. it's
okay. Look at me.

442
00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:35.988
Jamie? Jamie?

443
00:32:35.988 --> 00:32:37.689
Jamie. let it all
out. It's okay.

444
00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:39.625
That's it. breathe.
Just breathe.

445
00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:42.261
Just breathe. it's okay. Just
listen to my voice. Jamie.

446
00:32:42.261 --> 00:32:44.130
I know you like
being this tough girl

447
00:32:45.597 --> 00:32:47.099
that has everything
together. but it's okay

448
00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:49.201
if you just let it go. yeah?

449
00:32:50.402 --> 00:32:52.438
It's okay. That's it.

450
00:32:52.438 --> 00:32:53.239
That's it.

451
00:32:57.476 --> 00:32:58.344
- I'm fine.

452
00:33:01.647 --> 00:33:02.481
I'm fine.

453
00:33:04.883 --> 00:33:06.052
I'm fine.

454
00:33:06.052 --> 00:33:07.386
- [Amelia] Okay.

Shh. shh.

512

- What was that thing?
- I don't know!

513
00:38:01.813 --> 00:38:02.714
But it's gone.

514
00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:07.052
- Where did it go?
- I don't know.

515
00:38:08.186 --> 00:38:10.556
We gotta hide. Now.

516
00:38:10.556 --> 00:38:11.457
Alright?

517
00:38:11.457 --> 00:38:12.824
Let's go. Go.

518
00:38:12.824 --> 00:38:13.659
Shh. shh.

519
00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:27.706
Close that fucking
door. close the door.

(door slams)
(winces)

521
00:38:31.943 --> 00:38:32.778
Ma.

Ma!

523
00:38:37.082 --> 00:38:37.883
- Baby.

524
00:38:38.984 --> 00:38:41.353
(sweat simmers)
(brooding music)

525
00:38:41.353 --> 00:38:43.121
- Just focus on
your breathing. Ma.

526
00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:47.793
We're gonna get you outta here.

527
00:38:49.628 --> 00:38:51.296
Where are the girls?

528
00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:01.272
- Okay. so next time
remember not to take

529
00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:03.975
that right turn because-
- Or we get lost again.

530
00:39:03.975 --> 00:39:06.144
- Yeah. (laughs)

531
00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:08.279
Fuck! Fuck!

532
00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:09.581
- What?
- The keys!

533
00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:11.383
Shit! Oh. I think
I've dropped them.

534
00:39:11.383 --> 00:39:12.618
Oh. damn.

535
00:39:12.618 --> 00:39:14.386
- What. the keys to
Mom and Dad's car?

536
00:39:15.621 --> 00:39:17.456
Oh. um. don't worry.

537
00:39:17.456 --> 00:39:19.057
You know. you probably
left them at that place.

538
00:39:19.057 --> 00:39:20.459
We'll swing by in the morning
and see if we can find them.

539
00:39:21.993 --> 00:39:23.228
- Yeah. they probably
won't notice.

540
00:39:23.228 --> 00:39:24.630
- No. definitely not.

541
00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:29.200
(sighs)

542
00:39:32.638 --> 00:39:34.806
- Do you have them?
- Yeah.

543
00:39:38.744 --> 00:39:41.179
(keys clink)

544
00:39:51.256 --> 00:39:52.824
- Why is it so quiet in here?

545
00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:55.561

552
00:40:25.557 --> 00:40:26.391
- Dad?

553
00:40:27.493 --> 00:40:29.194

554
00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:39.170
(suspenseful music)

555
00:40:42.741 --> 00:40:43.542

- You can't go out there. okay?

597
00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:52.130
- What's going on?

598
00:43:53.264 --> 00:43:54.766
- Look. that thing
was already upstairs.

599
00:43:54.766 --> 00:43:56.301
and it's attacked
your grandmother.

600
00:43:56.301 --> 00:43:57.803
- Oh. my god! Grandma!

601
00:43:57.803 --> 00:44:00.071
Mom! Mom. what's going on?

Mom!

608
00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:13.518
What happened?

609
00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:17.388
(suspenseful music)

610
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.568
- Look. whatever that thing was.

611
00:44:30.568 --> 00:44:32.704
it's been up there for a while.

612
00:44:32.704 --> 00:44:34.706
So we either need to get
the fuck out of this house.

613
00:44:34.706 --> 00:44:36.274
or we need to get it out.

614
00:44:36.274 --> 00:44:38.243
- How do we do that?

615
00:44:38.243 --> 00:44:40.445
- I don't know. it's been...

616
00:44:40.445 --> 00:44:44.282
It's clearly been hibernating
or fuck-knows-what up there.

617
00:44:44.282 --> 00:44:47.018
Mom going up there
clearly released it.

618
00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:48.720
so whatever it was. we awoke it.

619
00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:53.491
- Whatever that thing was...

620
00:44:54.993 --> 00:44:56.427
It wasn't normal.

621
00:44:57.829 --> 00:45:00.331
- Something left over
from the disaster. maybe.

622
00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:03.468
- Mutation.

623
00:45:10.776 --> 00:45:12.543
- I'm going up there.

624
00:45:13.678 --> 00:45:15.313
- I'm coming with you.
- No. you're not.

625
00:45:15.313 --> 00:45:16.815
You're gonna stay
here and you're gonna
look after my mother

626
00:45:16.815 --> 00:45:19.617
and you're gonna look after
our daughter. alright?

627
00:45:19.617 --> 00:45:20.852
You're gonna help me
by helping them. okay?

628
00:45:20.852 --> 00:45:22.020
Just keep them safe.

629
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.655
- No. don't go.

630
00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:26.191
(sobs) I want to come with you.

631
00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:29.427
(kisses)

632
00:45:29.427 --> 00:45:31.362
- Okay. just stay here.

633
00:45:35.967 --> 00:45:38.669

(Amelia sobs)

640
00:46:28.653 --> 00:46:29.955
- Don't look.

641
00:46:29.955 --> 00:46:31.556
Amelia! Don't look.

642
00:46:32.657 --> 00:46:33.825
Okay?

643

inside the house.

733
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:33.244
It must've been
living in the attic.

734
00:53:33.244 --> 00:53:37.081
Whatever it was. we
thought it'd been mutated.

735
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.151
- It's a bat.

736
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.362
- It must've been left here

737
00:53:51.362 --> 00:53:54.932
when the town was
vacated and abandoned.

738
00:53:54.932 --> 00:53:55.766
It must've...

739
00:53:58.303 --> 00:54:02.373
That's why we didn't notice
it when we first got here.

740
00:54:02.373 --> 00:54:03.774
They only come out at night.

741
00:54:06.677 --> 00:54:08.679
Who knows what happened.

742
00:54:10.548 --> 00:54:14.919
But right now. we need to
figure a way out of here. okay?

743
00:54:18.289 --> 00:54:20.090
- His face. Mom.

744
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:22.660
- Don't think about it. okay?

745
00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.363
Just concentrate on
helping me get your sister

746
00:54:25.363 --> 00:54:27.131
and Grandma safe. okay?

747
00:54:34.572 --> 00:54:35.906
Okay. good girl.

748
00:54:38.509 --> 00:54:41.846
(dissonant eerie music)

749
00:54:59.096 --> 00:55:01.399
- There's nothing there.

750
00:55:01.399 --> 00:55:02.900
I think it's gone.

751
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.906
(Georgina wheezes)

752
00:55:13.511 --> 00:55:16.013
- Help me. Help me with Grandma.

753
00:55:21.218 --> 00:55:22.853
(Georgina groans)

754
00:55:22.853 --> 00:55:24.689
Hey. come on.

755
00:55:24.689 --> 00:55:25.590
Come on.

756
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:27.358
Good girl. good girl.

757
00:55:28.726 --> 00:55:33.030
That's it. good girl.
(Georgina wheezes)

758
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:37.868
(gasps)
(flesh squelches)

759
00:55:40.538 --> 00:55:45.543
(Jamie vomits)
(Georgina wheezes)

760
00:55:50.114 --> 00:55:50.948
Georgie?

761
00:55:51.882 --> 00:55:53.317
Hey.

762
00:55:53.317 --> 00:55:54.452
It's Lisa.

763
00:55:54.452 --> 00:55:55.285
- Lisa.

764
00:55:56.253 --> 00:55:57.087
Lisa.

765
00:55:58.389 --> 00:55:59.790
- We're gonna go to the car.

766
00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:02.627
We're gonna get help.

767
00:56:02.627 --> 00:56:03.661
and be right back.

768
00:56:04.962 --> 00:56:05.796
Okay?

769
00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:15.640
(Georgina spits)
(gasps)

770
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.476
(Georgina coughs)

771
00:56:22.747 --> 00:56:24.482
We're gonna be back.

772
00:56:24.482 --> 00:56:25.315
Okay?

773
00:56:29.787 --> 00:56:31.355
- What's happening to her. Mom?

774
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:34.024
- I don't know.

775
00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:37.094
She got attacked up there.

776
00:56:38.529 --> 00:56:40.765
Some kind of rabies?

777
00:56:40.765 --> 00:56:42.099
A virus?

778
00:56:42.099 --> 00:56:42.933
I don't know.

779
00:56:43.968 --> 00:56:45.503
- I think she's rotting.

780
00:56:47.171 --> 00:56:48.906
(Georgina wheezes)

781
00:56:48.906 --> 00:56:51.742
(Georgina coughs)

782
00:56:54.512 --> 00:56:55.345
- Come on.

783
00:57:00.117 --> 00:57:01.351
- Mom. don't do this.

784
00:57:03.488 --> 00:57:04.589
- Let us say goodbye.

785
00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:37.221
(Lisa sobs softly)

786
00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:59.409
- Come on. girls. We need to go.

787
00:58:00.511 --> 00:58:01.979
Okay?

788
00:58:01.979 --> 00:58:02.813
Come on.

789
00:58:07.518 --> 00:58:08.452
Good girls.

790
00:58:09.453 --> 00:58:10.454
Okay?

791
00:58:10.454 --> 00:58:11.288
Come here.

792
00:58:19.029 --> 00:58:21.532
(eerie music)

793
00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:30.641
We get to the car.

794
00:58:30.641 --> 00:58:31.776
We get out of here.

795
00:58:34.579 --> 00:58:35.412
- Mom.

796
00:58:37.548 --> 00:58:39.149
- Girls. what is it?

797
00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:39.984
- I...

798
00:58:41.218 --> 00:58:42.553
- I lost the keys.

799
00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:46.924
- Where are they?

800
00:58:46.924 --> 00:58:49.660
- I don't know. I
just dropped them.

801
00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.396
I... So. I'll go get them
in the light tomorrow.

802
00:58:57.902 --> 00:58:58.736
- Right.

803
00:59:00.605 --> 00:59:01.405
Okay.

804
00:59:04.775 --> 00:59:06.010
We get out of the house.

805
00:59:07.411 --> 00:59:10.047
and we run. and we
don't look back.

806
00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:12.717
We find somewhere to shelter.

807
00:59:13.784 --> 00:59:15.786
and we wait until morning.

808
00:59:15.786 --> 00:59:17.487
and we get help.

809
00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:20.190
Okay?

810
00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:21.025
Okay?

811
00:59:25.362 --> 00:59:26.964
Okay. stay with me.

812
00:59:35.172 --> 00:59:37.675
(eerie music)

813
00:59:58.062 --> 00:59:59.697
Will you do something for me?

814
00:59:59.697 --> 01:00:01.231
Okay. you run.

815
01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:03.200
You try and find the keys. okay?

816
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.835
But you run.

817
01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:08.873
You find a house. you
find anywhere. and
you get help. okay?

818
01:00:08.873 --> 01:00:09.707
Okay?

819
01:00:11.508 --> 01:00:13.077
I can't leave Grandma.

820
01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:15.312
I can't.

821
01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:18.282
I can't go with you.

822
01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:20.685
I gotta do it for Dad.

823
01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:23.087
Okay?

824
01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:24.221
You promise me.

825
01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:29.526
that you will protect her
and yourself at all costs.

826
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:31.428
You promise me?

827
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.201
- I promise.

828
01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:40.738
- [Lisa] Good girl.

829
01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:56.887
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

830
01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:58.823
- Where's Mom?
- We've gotta go.

831
01:00:58.823 --> 01:01:00.290
- No! Jamie!

832
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.092
I'm not leaving this
house without Mom!

833
01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:03.227
I'm not leaving without Mom!

834
01:01:03.227 --> 01:01:04.929
I'm not going
anywhere without her!

835
01:01:04.929 --> 01:01:06.596
- God damn it!

836
01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:07.664
Listen to me!

837
01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.904
We're fucking going. okay?

838
01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:15.740
- [Amelia] No!

839
01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.908
(squeals)

840
01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:26.316
(muffled thunder rumbles)
(suspenseful music)

841
01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:03.854
(muffled thunder rumbles)

842
01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.747
(phone rings)

843
01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:35.385
(phone rings)

844
01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:39.489
- [Operator] 911 operator.
What's your emergency?

845
01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:41.458
Hello?

846
01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:45.695
Hello?

847
01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:48.132
(bat snarls)

848
01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:51.668
Hello?

849
01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.140
(bat growls)

850
01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:59.944
(bat roars)
(Lisa screams)

851
01:02:59.944 --> 01:03:01.645
(phone thuds and dings)

852
01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:04.882
(Lisa screams)

853
01:03:04.882 --> 01:03:07.885
(bat snarls)

854
01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:09.887
(Lisa groans)

855
01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:12.456
(Lisa screams)

856
01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:16.726
(Lisa screams)

857
01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:19.629
(flesh squelches)
(bat snarls)

858
01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.066
(bat roars)

859
01:03:22.066 --> 01:03:23.901
(ominous music)
(Jamie and Amelia pant)

860
01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:26.736
(thunder rumbles)

861
01:03:33.844 --> 01:03:38.849
(Amelia sobs)
(Jamie pants)

862
01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:41.685
(Amelia grunts)

863
01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:48.926
(somber music)
(Amelia sobs)

864
01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:51.695
- I'm sorry.

865
01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:58.002
(Amelia sobs)

866
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.206
We're gonna get
through it. okay?

867
01:04:02.206 --> 01:04:04.441
We're gonna get through it.

868
01:04:09.713 --> 01:04:11.848
- Jamie. (sobs)

869
01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:12.682
Jamie.

870
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:17.821
I can't believe they're
gone and they're...

871
01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.624
- Don't think about it.

872
01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.162
- What happened?

873
01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:27.097
What happened to Dad?

874
01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:28.798
- Amelia. Not now. Amelia.

875
01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:30.700
- He's dead. he's dead.

876
01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:34.939
(sobs) He's dead.

877
01:04:34.939 --> 01:04:37.407
He's dead. he's dead. right?

878
01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:38.943
He's gone.

879
01:04:38.943 --> 01:04:40.610
He's gone. isn't he?

880
01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:43.914
(sobs)

881
01:04:57.461 --> 01:05:00.497
I don't just want
to survive tonight.

882
01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:02.566
I wanna kill that fucker.

883
01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.901
He took my...

884
01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:08.405
He took my family away!

885
01:05:13.177 --> 01:05:14.778
He took our family!

886
01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:19.416
(sobs)

887
01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:35.399
- Hey.

888
01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.160
- Why is that
thing following us?

889
01:06:08.132 --> 01:06:10.034
- When I was in the attic. I...

890
01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:14.238
I killed one of its offspring.

891
01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:20.444
It thinks we're predators.

892
01:06:20.444 --> 01:06:24.581
It's a protection.
animal instinct thing.

893
01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:31.688
(dark music)

894
01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:32.722
- What is that thing?

895
01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:36.693
- I don't know. like...

896
01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:42.166
Something left from when
they abandoned the place.

897
01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:50.774
- You said earlier that it
was a bat. but I saw it.

898
01:06:54.111 --> 01:06:55.512
Didn't look like one to me.

899
01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:58.415
Yeah. but it's like...

900
01:06:58.415 --> 01:06:59.849
It's mutated.

901
01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:06.156
It's like part bat. part...

902
01:07:07.624 --> 01:07:08.792
I don't know.

903
01:07:11.128 --> 01:07:13.130
- How long has it
been living up there?

904
01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:16.933
- Months? Years?

905
01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:22.106
It was hiding in the dark.

906
01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.008
Until we disturbed it.

907
01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.423
(eerie music)

908
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:10.754
- I'm just gonna
go to the bathroom.

909
01:08:25.202 --> 01:08:28.205
(suspenseful music)

910
01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:40.350
(muffled thunder rumbles)

911
01:08:44.521 --> 01:08:45.922
- Is there anybody up there?

912
01:08:52.262 --> 01:08:53.630
Please can I have a sign?

913
01:08:56.099 --> 01:08:58.067
'Cause I don't know
what to do anymore.

914
01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:04.708
I can't do it without you.

915
01:09:08.378 --> 01:09:13.282
I know if you were here. you'd
tell me to stop being silly.

916
01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.790
But I don't know what to do.

917
01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:25.795

in the dead sea harem *

* Winds sweep up through
the halls but yet no sound *

1042
01:22:49.532 --> 01:22:52.735
* And the temperature's down

1043
01:22:52.735 --> 01:22:54.937
* And it's darker now

1044
01:22:54.937 --> 01:22:58.341
* A shadow grows too
by a fleeting light *

1045
01:22:58.341 --> 01:23:02.511
* Where greed swings a
demon of a cruel delight *

1046
01:23:02.511 --> 01:23:06.115
* Piles of sand growing
features on the floor *

1047
01:23:06.115 --> 01:23:09.985
* The souls of the harem
moving to the door *

1048
01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.255
* A figure rose from the sand

1049
01:23:12.255 --> 01:23:14.389
* And glimpse its
shadow on the wall *

1050
01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:18.460
* Where a demon now stands
there. 10 feet tall *

1051
01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:21.864
* His broken leather wings
give a bitterly crack *

1052
01:23:21.864 --> 01:23:26.869
* As he stares in the darkness
with his smile driven back *

1053
01:23:27.636 --> 01:23:30.406
* So simmer down

1054
01:23:30.406 --> 01:23:33.675
* This is feeding town
