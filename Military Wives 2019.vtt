00:00:58.393 --> 00:00:59.894
<i>...element of surprise is</i>

2
00:00:59.978 --> 00:01:01.646
<i>the only tactic Gordon Brown has left.</i>

3
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:03.523
<i>We'll be going live to Parliament.</i>

4
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.193
<i>But first. more British troops
are being deployed to Afghanistan</i>

5
00:01:07.277 --> 00:01:08.987
<i>as part of the biggest
joint offensive...</i>

6
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.864
<i>...since the 2001 invasion.</i>

7
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:13.700
<i>The British Army's death toll
has already exceeded</i>

8
00:01:13.783 --> 00:01:15.827
<i>that of Iraq and the Falklands War.</i>

9
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.871
<i>with those wounded
and requiring treatment at home</i>

10
00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:19.497
<i>also rising sharply.</i>

11
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:21.791
<i>Fatalities have ris...</i>

12
00:01:36.848 --> 00:01:37.849
ID. please.

13
00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:39.851
I just popped into town.

14
00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:46.900
Private Shaw.

15
00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:50.111
Can you tell the young private
who I am?

16
00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:51.196
Sorry. ma'am.

17
00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:52.906
Increased security
with the deployment tonight.

18
00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:56.910
I'm sure the MOD's very interested
in the Colonel's supper.

19
00:02:04.793 --> 00:02:07.086
What are you doing?
Wake up. yeah?

20
00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:08.630
Do you realise who that was?

21
00:02:08.838 --> 00:02:09.923
Just get some wine.

22
00:02:11.424 --> 00:02:12.634
Hello.

23
00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:16.179
Do we have any olive oil?

24
00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:19.265
Erm... we have oil.

25
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:22.352
Oh.

26
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:26.940
I went all the way into town.
then forgot it.

27
00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:31.528
- Go ahead.
- Thank you. that's very kind.

28
00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:33.988
Erm... All right.

29
00:02:34.072 --> 00:02:37.534
Whole new world for you this time.
Lisa. Sergeant-Major's wife.

30
00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.703
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

31
00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:44.415
Lots of new responsibilities for you
with the wives.

32
00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:45.500
Yeah.

33
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:48.086
I'm sure you've got lots of ideas
up your sleeve.

34
00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:51.339
- Oh. yeah.
- Planning is key.

35
00:02:51.422 --> 00:02:53.216
OK. well. thank you for the advice.

36
00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:54.634
Any time.

37
00:03:22.495 --> 00:03:23.538
You not done yet?

38
00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:25.832
Grace came over to say goodbye.

39
00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:28.960
- Oh. right. Where's she going?
- To live with her aunt off base.

40
00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:31.087
And have a life.

41
00:03:31.754 --> 00:03:34.591
There are positives
to being surrounded by people

42
00:03:34.674 --> 00:03:35.800
who are in the same boat as you.

43
00:03:35.884 --> 00:03:37.302
Mum. please don't.

44
00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:41.639
By the left! Left wheel!

45
00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.066
<i>He's coming to get him. Rargh!</i>

46
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.029
<i>Come on. Billy. story time. Come on.</i>

47
00:03:57.113 --> 00:03:59.198
<i>Are you going away tomorrow?</i>

48
00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.327
<i>I am. but only for a little bit.
though. OK?</i>

49
00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:05.788
<i>Who's gonna read stories
when you're away?</i>

50
00:04:13.713 --> 00:04:15.882
Oh. God. why are you so clumsy?

51
00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:19.344
Maybe this is God's way of telling us
to put it in a frame.

52
00:04:19.427 --> 00:04:22.221
- No. I like it on the fridge.
- It'd be better protected under glass.

53
00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:24.057
It would be frozen and formal.

54
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.726
I prefer it where it lives.
on the fridge.

55
00:04:27.352 --> 00:04:30.647
in amongst my postcards
and my shopping lists and all my...

56
00:04:32.357 --> 00:04:33.566
my everyday things.

57
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.777
Jamie always hated that photo.

58
00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:38.821
Said it made him look like
an American talk show host.

59
00:04:40.198 --> 00:04:41.199
Well. I like it.

60
00:04:45.787 --> 00:04:47.497
- Fine.
- Fine.

61
00:04:56.297 --> 00:04:58.549
Are you going to be OK when I'm gone?

62
00:04:58.633 --> 00:04:59.676
Mm.

63
00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.011
I'll be fine. Of course I will.

64
00:05:02.095 --> 00:05:04.514
I mean. it's my fifth tour.

65
00:05:05.056 --> 00:05:08.643
Yeah. but things are
completely different this time.

66
00:05:14.232 --> 00:05:18.361
Do you know? I think I'm going to
offer my help in supporting the wives.

67
00:05:18.945 --> 00:05:21.656
I don't trust that Lisa.
the new RSM's wife.

68
00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:23.783
She's very cavalier
about the whole thing.

69
00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:25.868
- I'm sure she has a plan.
- Mm.

70
00:05:27.912 --> 00:05:31.165
Not that she won't appreciate
your support as well.

71
00:05:36.254 --> 00:05:38.548
Look after Mummy.
If she gets upset. give her a hug.

72
00:05:38.965 --> 00:05:40.633
- I will.
- OK. good boy.

73
00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:43.761
This is gonna keep you safe
while I'm away.

74
00:05:44.637 --> 00:05:46.097
Just like mine'll keep me safe.

75
00:05:49.017 --> 00:05:50.018
Right. kids.

76
00:05:50.977 --> 00:05:52.770
OK. remember what we do with this?

77
00:05:53.563 --> 00:05:55.857
- Cross it off every day.
- Yeah. until?

78
00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:58.526
- Daddy's home.
- And we are?

79
00:05:58.735 --> 00:05:59.777
- Chuffed.
- Chuffed.

80
00:05:59.861 --> 00:06:01.112
Chuffed. yeah.

81
00:06:28.848 --> 00:06:30.600
Yeah. I know.

82
00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:35.021
Check out the blast boxers.

83
00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:39.567
- Not funny. Red.
- What? They're Kevlar.

84
00:06:40.318 --> 00:06:42.612
I'm just protecting the family jewels
for your pleasure.

85
00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:44.697
- Who's she talking to?
- I don't know.

86
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:47.200
Better not be talking to those lads.

87
00:06:47.992 --> 00:06:50.078
- I was a lad once. remember?
- Yeah. thanks.

88
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.704
That's really helpful.

89
00:06:52.622 --> 00:06:53.664
Is that my razor?

90
00:06:54.832 --> 00:06:57.126
Are you packing my stuff up again
before I've left?

91
00:06:57.293 --> 00:06:58.294
No.

92
00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:00.838
Well. I'm taking this.

93
00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:03.382
- Why? You're not gonna read it.
- I am. It's about leadership.

94
00:07:03.883 --> 00:07:06.594
Fine. Last time you took
<i>War And Peace.</i>

95
00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:11.349
spent your whole time reading
<i>Heat</i> magazine and watching romcoms.

96
00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:13.976
Are you angry?

97
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.104
No. I don't give a shit what you read.

98
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.232
I'm just getting ready for another
six months as a single mother.

99
00:07:20.358 --> 00:07:21.359
All right?

100
00:07:23.194 --> 00:07:25.404
There. you can forget about me now.

101
00:07:31.244 --> 00:07:32.245
Just get off.

102
00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:36.290
Get off!

103
00:07:38.793 --> 00:07:39.919
Do you really want me to?

104
00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:48.886
No.

105
00:07:59.522 --> 00:08:00.690
Oh. shit!

106
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.325
Yes.

107
00:08:13.786 --> 00:08:14.912
Listen. I've got to go.

108
00:08:15.163 --> 00:08:17.582
Yeah. OK. I'll speak to you later.
Bye-bye.

109
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:23.462
You better write to me.

110
00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:25.756
And I mean proper letters.
not just emails.

111
00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:31.220
Come here.

112
00:08:50.156 --> 00:08:52.241
They've stopped doing
the jumbo crossword in the paper

113
00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:53.868
so I printed it off the net.

114
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.331
No crossword?

115
00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:02.501
I've got to go.

116
00:09:04.337 --> 00:09:05.421
Right.

117
00:09:39.747 --> 00:09:40.748
Oh.

118
00:09:41.374 --> 00:09:43.000
- Hi. Kate.
- Hello. Lisa.

119
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.212
I'm late for a meeting
with Crooks.

120
00:09:47.046 --> 00:09:49.840
- Forgot the clocks went forward.
- Oh.

121
00:09:50.675 --> 00:09:51.676
Well. don't worry about it.

122
00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:52.927
The Brigadier's
still in there with him.

123
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.720
Oh. great. Great.

124
00:09:57.974 --> 00:09:58.975
Quite right.

125
00:09:59.392 --> 00:10:01.602
I imagine the spouses
are quite anxious.

126
00:10:01.727 --> 00:10:03.562
We all know what to expect this time.

127
00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:06.148
- Who's your point person?
- Lisa Lawson is the RSM's wife. sir.

128
00:10:06.232 --> 00:10:08.484
She wasn't too chuffed to get the job
but I think she'll rise to it.

129
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:10.403
These things don't happen overnight.

130
00:10:11.028 --> 00:10:13.447
And Kate Barclay will help
with the pastoral care.

131
00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:15.825
- Kate will?
- Yes. sir. She volunteered.

132
00:10:15.908 --> 00:10:19.495
I think after losing Jamie on the last
tour. she's keen to keep occupied.

133
00:10:19.578 --> 00:10:21.330
Sorry to interrupt.

134
00:10:21.414 --> 00:10:23.416
- Kate.
- Hello. Jeremy.

135
00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:25.876
The Brigadier and I were
discussing the new welfare directives.

136
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.129
Social activities.
getting the women on board.

137
00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:30.881
Top brass telling us what to do.

138
00:10:30.965 --> 00:10:32.883
I think I should leave you to it.

139
00:10:40.266 --> 00:10:42.435
- Oh...
- No. that's all right.

140
00:10:43.561 --> 00:10:44.562
Got it.

141
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:48.149
Colonel Barclay's wife would like
to take a more active role

142
00:10:48.232 --> 00:10:50.151
in supporting the spouses
during this deployment.

143
00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:51.402
Oh!

144
00:10:52.194 --> 00:10:54.405
I know it's not customary
for the Colonel's wife

145
00:10:54.488 --> 00:10:55.906
to get her hands dirty...

146
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.450
Yeah. exactly. That's my role.

147
00:10:57.533 --> 00:10:58.784
No. of course. Of course.

148
00:11:01.037 --> 00:11:05.541
So. erm... what do you have in store
in terms of social activities?

149
00:11:08.377 --> 00:11:09.837
Well. we have our coffee mornings.

150
00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:11.756
Coffee mornings. yeah.

151
00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:13.049
And?

152
00:11:16.177 --> 00:11:17.470
Pot luck parties.

153
00:11:17.553 --> 00:11:19.263
Oh. pot luck party?

154
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.599
That's when everyone brings a dish
and gets drunk.

155
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.435
Of course. we've got
my walk on the moors.

156
00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:28.022
With the greatest respect. Kate. most
women don't have a mess to drink in.

157
00:11:28.439 --> 00:11:30.024
They can't go into town and get pissed

158
00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:31.942
so they need somewhere
to let off steam.

159
00:11:32.109 --> 00:11:33.361
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

160
00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:34.695
Absolutely.

161
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.824
Erm... so. anything else?

162
00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:45.539
Why don't we just brainstorm with
the women at the next coffee morning?

163
00:11:49.502 --> 00:11:50.669
Go and have a play. Bills.

164
00:11:52.546 --> 00:11:55.174
You can bring whatever cakes you want.

165
00:11:56.175 --> 00:11:57.968
I'll just introduce you
to Annie and Helen.

166
00:11:58.094 --> 00:12:00.429
This is Sarah. Private Wheeler's wife.

167
00:12:00.513 --> 00:12:02.723
- Just marched in yesterday.
- Are you settling in?

168
00:12:02.807 --> 00:12:06.560
Fine. yeah. except everyone
keeps asking me what rank I am.

169
00:12:06.644 --> 00:12:09.647
What the hell is that? They look like
squashed little turds.

170
00:12:10.773 --> 00:12:13.359
I think it's. erm...
Kate's contribution.

171
00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:16.362
Lisa seems to be running late.

172
00:12:16.445 --> 00:12:19.907
- She's here.
- Hey.

173
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.409
Oh. I'm sorry.

174
00:12:22.535 --> 00:12:24.787
- Would you like to come to the front?
- No. you're grand.

175
00:12:25.204 --> 00:12:26.580
You don't want to kick things off?

176
00:12:27.248 --> 00:12:28.457
Well. it has kicked off.

177
00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:33.129
What do people do
in these coffee mornings?

178
00:12:33.212 --> 00:12:35.673
I think they just... drink coffee.

179
00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:41.178
Sorry. everyone. Hello.

180
00:12:41.554 --> 00:12:45.099
If you'd all like to gather round
and take a seat.

181
00:12:45.224 --> 00:12:48.394
There's no need to be shy.
Front row's nice and empty.

182
00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:50.396
So. some of you don't know me.

183
00:12:51.063 --> 00:12:53.774
I'm Kate Barclay.
Colonel Barclay's wife.

184
00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:58.279
Today we need to come up with
some exciting activities and pursuits

185
00:12:58.404 --> 00:13:01.657
for us to do
while our service people are away.

186
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:03.033
So. shall we start?

187
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.537
Erm... Lisa? Lisa? Lisa?

188
00:13:07.872 --> 00:13:09.707
Do you think you could write things
on the board for me?

189
00:13:10.499 --> 00:13:11.542
Thank you.

190
00:13:15.254 --> 00:13:16.297
So...

191
00:13:17.173 --> 00:13:21.010
I thought we could have
a formal dinner once a month

192
00:13:21.093 --> 00:13:23.596
to explore all aspects
of global cuisine.

193
00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:30.728
Then perhaps the film night
could become a film season

194
00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:32.938
where we could examine
the body of an auteur

195
00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:35.983
and would provide an
educational aspect to leisure pursuits

196
00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.318
in a non-alcoholic environment.

197
00:13:37.401 --> 00:13:39.069
Non-alcoholic environment?

198
00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:42.198
- What's the matter?
- No. no.

199
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:44.325
It's just in general.
when we watch films.

200
00:13:44.742 --> 00:13:47.620
you know.
usually we like them to be... fun.

201
00:13:47.703 --> 00:13:50.414
Perhaps open the ideas to the room?

202
00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:51.665
Yeah.

203
00:13:52.416 --> 00:13:55.628
Well. we did a book club in Germany.

204
00:13:55.753 --> 00:13:57.254
Book club. great. great. Super.

205
00:13:57.338 --> 00:13:59.173
What about a footie club?

206
00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:02.426
We had a cracking five-a-side
in Aldershot. it was something else.

207
00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:04.512
Football! Yes. why not?

208
00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:07.223
- Start a needlework club.
- Needlework. right.

209
00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:09.225
Baking or bread-making.

210
00:14:09.308 --> 00:14:12.061
Yeah. Yeah. and then we could
collect alms for the poor

211
00:14:12.144 --> 00:14:14.063
and do a bit of basket weaving.

212
00:14:15.356 --> 00:14:17.066
It's all a bit <i>Little Women.</i> isn't it?

213
00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:19.193
Let's just get the strippers in.

214
00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:21.987
Give the rear party soldiers a case
of beer and have a Mr World contest.

215
00:14:22.071 --> 00:14:23.781
That'd be very entertaining.

216
00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:28.369
But. actually. right now.
we're looking for clubs to join.

217
00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:30.579
What about singing?

218
00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:31.789
Singing?

219
00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.917
My bridesmaids did <i>Angels</i> by Robbie
at my wedding.

220
00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:36.919
It was amazing.

221
00:14:38.045 --> 00:14:40.464
OK. erm... yeah. Super.

222
00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:44.885
A choir. Has anyone had any experience
of running a choir?

223
00:14:45.052 --> 00:14:47.930
Lisa. you're musical. no?

224
00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:51.642
No. my mum used to teach music.

225
00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.435
But. I mean.
choir's not really my thing.

226
00:14:53.686 --> 00:14:54.687
Right.

227
00:14:56.981 --> 00:14:57.982
Knitting?

228
00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:00.317
Knitting?

229
00:15:00.985 --> 00:15:01.986
Knitting.

230
00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:10.119
Should we have invited Kate?

231
00:15:10.828 --> 00:15:12.037
I bet you she can knit.

232
00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:18.043
Ohh.

233
00:15:18.127 --> 00:15:20.754
You know this is supposed to
take your mind off being upset?

234
00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:24.258
I just... I wanted to make
something nice for Liam.

235
00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:26.760
I love wool. I love sheep.

236
00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.596
Any little mistakes
give knitting character.

237
00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:30.347
Let's have a look.

238
00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:37.521
There you go. make a lovely...
tea cosy.

239
00:15:37.605 --> 00:15:41.066
- Or toilet roll cover.
- Cos we all need one of those.

240
00:15:41.317 --> 00:15:44.194
I don't know how you lot
can just makes jokes.

241
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.155
I just feel sick all the time.

242
00:15:46.238 --> 00:15:49.408
Every time the phone rings.
every time the doorbell goes.

243
00:15:50.576 --> 00:15:52.036
I feel sick. How do you cope?

244
00:15:55.831 --> 00:15:57.625
Do you not... talk about it?

245
00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:03.130
- Who wants some wine?
- I'd love some wine.

246
00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:07.926
- Lisa. where are your glasses?
- In the dishwasher.

247
00:16:09.428 --> 00:16:11.430
All right. Frankie? Give us a smile!

248
00:16:11.764 --> 00:16:12.765
There you go.

249
00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:16.060
What?

250
00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:24.401
There are some benefits
when they go away.

251
00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:26.153
I grow my pubes.

252
00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:28.739
It's like Sherwood Forest
by the time Matt gets home.

253
00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:32.785
And you don't have to
brush your teeth.

254
00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:35.496
You don't have to pretend
you like <i>Top Gear.</i>

255
00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.418
<i>Today we're gonna be making some tea.</i>

256
00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:43.879
<i>and taking a look at
the Brexar glass kettle.</i>

257
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:48.425
<i>For today only. if you purchase
the Brexar glass kettle.</i>

258
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:53.138
<i>you also get this stunning five-piece
knife set and wooden block.</i>

259
00:16:53.222 --> 00:16:56.350
<i>So clever and unique.
It's the Brexar glass kettle.</i>

260
00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:58.602
<i>It takes tea-making
to a whole new level.</i>

261
00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.287
- Yeah?
<i>- Hello. Kate.</i>

262
00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:20.249
<i>Comms are down.
No further details at this time.</i>

263
00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:22.626
But they've only just got there.

264
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.461
<i>Sat phone and internet on lockdown.</i>

265
00:17:24.545 --> 00:17:26.588
<i>I'll let you know when I hear further.</i>

266
00:17:26.672 --> 00:17:27.673
Yeah.

267
00:17:34.722 --> 00:17:36.056
- Hello.
- Hiya.

268
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.975
- Is your mum in?
- Mum?

269
00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:42.062
So... how was knitting club?

270
00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:45.065
- There isn't a knitting club.
- Yes. I've heard the joke.

271
00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:47.651
First rule of knitting club:
"There is no knitting club."

272
00:17:47.735 --> 00:17:51.363
They disbanded last night
due to impracticalities.

273
00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:52.698
Oh.

274
00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:56.785
- They can't knit.
- Oh.

275
00:17:57.911 --> 00:17:58.912
Hi.

276
00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.497
Get a move on. you're gonna be late.

277
00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:03.167
Yeah?

278
00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:05.085
Comms are down.

279
00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:10.007
- What. already?
- They're stuck in Green Zone.

280
00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.343
- They've got to tab out.
- Do the women know?

281
00:18:13.761 --> 00:18:15.345
A text message has gone out.

282
00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:16.972
Best thing is to keep busy.

283
00:18:24.438 --> 00:18:26.523
<i>...possible bypass routes.</i>

284
00:18:26.607 --> 00:18:28.734
<i>We see first-hand for ourselves.</i>

285
00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:32.946
<i>While we're filming. a report comes in
of another bombing close to the base.</i>

286
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.241
<i>The Yorks Quick Reaction Force
gets ready to move out.</i>

287
00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:37.326
You all right?

288
00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:40.037
<i>Just been scrambled
because a suicide bomber</i>

289
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.206
<i>- has just detonated his device...</i>
- Thank you.

290
00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:45.417
Gonna look good.

291
00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:49.171
Sorry.

292
00:18:51.924 --> 00:18:53.050
Hello?

293
00:18:54.343 --> 00:18:55.803
No. I've not been in an accident.

294
00:19:21.078 --> 00:19:22.663
- Hello.
- Hi.

295
00:19:22.913 --> 00:19:24.540
I just thought I'd pop in
and see how you're doing.

296
00:19:25.541 --> 00:19:27.459
Oh. OK. Thank you.

297
00:19:27.543 --> 00:19:28.669
Erm...

298
00:19:29.628 --> 00:19:33.298
Richard and I were also married
last minute. pre-deployment.

299
00:19:33.382 --> 00:19:36.385
My family all thought I was pregnant.
just being coy.

300
00:19:39.638 --> 00:19:40.639
Oh. are you?

301
00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:44.059
No. Liam just wanted me
to be next of kin.

302
00:19:44.977 --> 00:19:48.021
You know. comms down
doesn't necessarily mean anything.

303
00:19:48.105 --> 00:19:50.065
It's just the men
aren't allowed to talk to us.

304
00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:54.111
The military want to ensure that
no false information gets through.

305
00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.655
It's very important to keep busy.

306
00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:58.782
Less time to think about things.

307
00:19:59.992 --> 00:20:00.993
Yeah.

308
00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.370
I was actually thinking of decorating.

309
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:04.872
Hm.

310
00:20:04.955 --> 00:20:07.666
It is a bit depressing. isn't it.
the magnolia box?

311
00:20:09.418 --> 00:20:11.879
I was gonna do a. erm...

312
00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:13.714
a signature wall.

313
00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:17.426
And then pick out the purple
in the other walls.

314
00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:20.137
Yeah. hm... it's a bit signature.

315
00:20:20.262 --> 00:20:22.180
It took Richard and I
six coats of paint

316
00:20:22.264 --> 00:20:25.142
to cover up the mess I made
when we first marched out.

317
00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:29.521
Oh. God. sorry. that's Liam.

318
00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:32.232
He always puts our teddies
into different sexual positions.

319
00:20:32.316 --> 00:20:33.692
every time I leave the room.

320
00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:35.861
It's to make me laugh.
he's done it since we were kids.

321
00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:39.072
Not "kids" kids. since we were 15.

322
00:20:40.616 --> 00:20:42.367
Let's get cracking on these boxes.
shall we?

323
00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:44.620
I've got this exercise bike
I need to finish.

324
00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:47.122
OK. great.

325
00:20:59.343 --> 00:21:00.844
Comms back on is a good thing!

326
00:21:00.928 --> 00:21:03.180
Mm. yeah. I know. Sorry.

327
00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:04.723
Aww!

328
00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:06.808
Come on.

329
00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:09.937
Don't be silly.

330
00:21:10.646 --> 00:21:12.898
Let's get some music on
and get cracking. eh?

331
00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:20.697
Sorry.

332
00:21:21.615 --> 00:21:22.658
Thanks.

333
00:21:29.623 --> 00:21:30.916
What have we got here?

334
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.251
Erm...

335
00:21:37.923 --> 00:21:40.008
Probably just start
with the instructions.

336
00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:42.052
- Here you go.
- Let's have a look.

337
00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:48.850
<i>Sprung in completeness</i>

338
00:21:48.976 --> 00:21:50.102
<i>Where His feet...</i>

339
00:21:57.067 --> 00:21:59.736
Just give one of those to everyone.
There should be enough.

340
00:22:03.115 --> 00:22:04.116
What you doing?

341
00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:07.828
Right. has everyone got a hymn sheet?

342
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.622
- Time to liven up this coffee morning.
- What's happening?

343
00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:13.000
I'm going to give you all a note.

344
00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:16.461
Then I'm going to count to three
and we can start. So...

345
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:22.759
<i>La-la-la-la-la-la</i>

346
00:22:22.843 --> 00:22:24.302
One. two. three...

347
00:22:24.386 --> 00:22:28.724
<i>Morning has broken</i>

348
00:22:28.807 --> 00:22:30.308
<i>Like the...</i>

349
00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:33.437
Okay. I'll just... Everyone up.

350
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.521
Come on. up your get.

351
00:22:34.813 --> 00:22:35.897
I'll start again.

352
00:22:37.232 --> 00:22:38.859
One. two. three...

353
00:22:38.942 --> 00:22:42.779
<i>Morning has broken</i>

354
00:22:42.863 --> 00:22:46.742
<i>Like the first morning</i>

355
00:22:46.825 --> 00:22:50.412
<i>Blackbird has spoken</i>

356
00:22:50.495 --> 00:22:53.999
<i>Like the first bird</i>

357
00:22:56.793 --> 00:22:57.961
<i>Prai...</i>

358
00:22:59.254 --> 00:23:01.006
OK. I'll just give you the note again.

359
00:23:01.089 --> 00:23:03.008
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

360
00:23:03.842 --> 00:23:05.302
One. two. three...

361
00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:09.014
<i>Praise for the singing</i>

362
00:23:09.097 --> 00:23:12.601
<i>Praise for the morning</i>

363
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:17.564
<i>Praise for the singing...</i>

364
00:23:17.647 --> 00:23:18.982
<i>Fresh from the...</i>

365
00:23:19.066 --> 00:23:20.484
Billy. Sorry.

366
00:23:20.567 --> 00:23:22.027
<i>...world</i>

367
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.321
That's... That's lovely.
That was lovely.

368
00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:26.782
I've got to run to work. Sorry. Sorry.

369
00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:28.825
Bye.

370
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:30.202
I was really enjoying that.

371
00:23:31.369 --> 00:23:33.205
- Lisa. wait.
- Why?

372
00:23:33.872 --> 00:23:36.291
That was like the incantations
of a bunch of witches.

373
00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:38.293
- Bit dramatic.
- No. it's an understatement.

374
00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:40.128
That was horrible.

375
00:23:40.212 --> 00:23:41.880
They need something to focus on.

376
00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:43.965
I think Afghan is enough.

377
00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:48.512
No. besides that. They need something
to work on collectively.

378
00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:50.972
a project.
something that brings them together.

379
00:23:51.056 --> 00:23:54.559
Look. if you think singing
<i>Onward. Christian Soldiers</i>

380
00:23:54.643 --> 00:23:56.603
with a pole up your arse
is what the women need.

381
00:23:56.686 --> 00:23:58.063
you're more out of touch
than I thought.

382
00:23:58.146 --> 00:24:00.732
I am simply trying to do my duty
as Colonel's wife...

383
00:24:00.816 --> 00:24:03.902
If you want to do it. just go ahead.
You don't need my permission.

384
00:24:03.985 --> 00:24:06.988
We both know the women
won't join if you don't.

385
00:24:07.239 --> 00:24:08.740
I'm quite aware
of how they feel about me.

386
00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:13.411
Listen. I know you still want
to be part of the gang.

387
00:24:13.495 --> 00:24:17.207
But unfortunately. you have
a leadership role on this tour.

388
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.084
And that means responsibilities.

389
00:24:22.212 --> 00:24:23.922
You may not need the choir. Lisa.

390
00:24:24.256 --> 00:24:25.382
But those women do.

391
00:24:26.341 --> 00:24:28.635
<i>Blackbird has spoken</i>

392
00:24:28.718 --> 00:24:31.388
Can we at least call it
a singing club?

393
00:24:31.847 --> 00:24:33.890
How do people at Flitcroft
get involved?

394
00:24:33.974 --> 00:24:35.183
They just turn up.

395
00:24:35.475 --> 00:24:37.561
No auditions. everyone welcome.

396
00:24:37.853 --> 00:24:40.313
Yeah. so it's like a drop-in.

397
00:24:41.064 --> 00:24:42.774
Yeah. and then you commit.

398
00:24:42.858 --> 00:24:44.317
But only if you really want to.

399
00:24:45.944 --> 00:24:48.780
It's not about experience
or endless practice at home.

400
00:24:48.864 --> 00:24:50.240
<i>Though it'd be encouraged.</i>

401
00:24:50.323 --> 00:24:52.075
<i>So it's more about enthusiasm?</i>

402
00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:53.451
<i>- Well...
- Yes.</i>

403
00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:55.162
I know you're busy
but would you like...

404
00:24:55.954 --> 00:24:58.665
Just two hours. once a week.
Open to all ranks.

405
00:25:01.835 --> 00:25:04.421
Do you watch <i>Songs Of Praise?</i>
You might enjoy that.

406
00:25:05.797 --> 00:25:09.634
We're forming a choir. Would you like
to join? It's on Thursdays.

407
00:25:09.718 --> 00:25:11.178
<i>What kinds of songs will you sing?</i>

408
00:25:11.261 --> 00:25:12.262
<i>Pop music.</i>

409
00:25:12.345 --> 00:25:13.930
<i>Good old traditional and rousing.</i>

410
00:25:14.014 --> 00:25:15.140
<i>Rock.</i>

411
00:25:15.891 --> 00:25:18.310
- So it's gonna be like Sister Act?
- Yes.

412
00:25:18.393 --> 00:25:20.020
You know. without the Mafia hitmen.

413
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.563
And the God bit.

414
00:25:23.023 --> 00:25:25.317
All right. I'll have a think.

415
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.360
<i>It's open to all ranks. right?</i>

416
00:25:27.444 --> 00:25:29.070
Oh. yes. this choir is inclusive.

417
00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:32.908
Yeah. this singing club
is gonna be a lot of fun.

418
00:25:33.533 --> 00:25:34.784
And uplifting.

419
00:25:34.868 --> 00:25:37.829
Yeah. and there'll be
a few beers afterwards.

420
00:25:41.708 --> 00:25:43.543
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

421
00:25:43.627 --> 00:25:45.587
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

422
00:25:48.924 --> 00:25:51.927
That's lovely. a soprano. Little bit
flat. but we can work on that.

423
00:25:52.385 --> 00:25:54.971
- Who's next?
- I thought we didn't have to audition.

424
00:25:55.055 --> 00:25:58.058
This isn't an audition.
I'm just determining your vocal range.

425
00:25:59.476 --> 00:26:00.518
Anyone?

426
00:26:01.686 --> 00:26:03.563
- Oh?
- No.

427
00:26:03.647 --> 00:26:04.648
No?

428
00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:07.776
Why don't we just start off as a...
like. as a group?

429
00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:09.903
Yeah. OK. Feel free.

430
00:26:10.487 --> 00:26:12.197
- Yeah?
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

431
00:26:12.948 --> 00:26:14.032
Erm...

432
00:26:14.699 --> 00:26:16.201
All right. everyone stand up.

433
00:26:16.493 --> 00:26:18.078
Everyone on your feet.

434
00:26:19.287 --> 00:26:20.288
Yeah?

435
00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:23.166
When you can't sing the note

436
00:26:23.708 --> 00:26:24.751
just sit down.

437
00:26:25.418 --> 00:26:28.046
It's OK. I'll do it.

438
00:26:29.506 --> 00:26:32.008
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

439
00:26:34.177 --> 00:26:36.346
<i>La-la-la-la-la</i>

440
00:26:38.515 --> 00:26:40.558
La-la-la-la-la

441
00:26:50.277 --> 00:26:51.736
Right. OK.

442
00:26:51.945 --> 00:26:55.115
Right. so everyone who's standing.
you're a soprano.

443
00:26:55.198 --> 00:26:57.242
So you just go to your left.

444
00:26:58.493 --> 00:27:01.288
That's your right. My left.

445
00:27:01.413 --> 00:27:03.415
And if you're still sitting down.
you're an alto.

446
00:27:03.498 --> 00:27:04.874
Go to the right.

447
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:07.377
Ruby. I think
you're more of a minor tone.

448
00:27:07.752 --> 00:27:09.546
She just means your voice
is really powerful.

449
00:27:09.629 --> 00:27:11.214
- Yeah.
- You know...

450
00:27:11.506 --> 00:27:13.091
Imagine you're Luke Skywalker

451
00:27:13.174 --> 00:27:14.759
and you have to learn
to harness The Force.

452
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.221
So where do the minors stand?

453
00:27:18.388 --> 00:27:19.597
- At the back.
- In the front.

454
00:27:20.807 --> 00:27:22.142
Erm... middle?

455
00:27:22.267 --> 00:27:23.435
Yeah.

456
00:27:24.978 --> 00:27:25.979
So...

457
00:27:27.439 --> 00:27:28.898
- You go ahead. No. no. go ahead.
- No...

458
00:27:29.107 --> 00:27:32.485
- OK...
- Thanks very much. Lisa. Lovely.

459
00:27:32.902 --> 00:27:36.740
So today's practice is going to focus
on something called count singing.

460
00:27:36.823 --> 00:27:38.116
Don't panic.

461
00:27:38.199 --> 00:27:39.951
It's a very easy exercise

462
00:27:40.035 --> 00:27:43.204
to help us with pitch and rhythm
without having to learn lyrics.

463
00:27:43.288 --> 00:27:44.998
Why don't we just sing a song?

464
00:27:45.123 --> 00:27:46.750
This is just how
I learnt it at school.

465
00:27:47.334 --> 00:27:48.335
So...

466
00:27:48.752 --> 00:27:51.004
<i>One. one. two. one</i>

467
00:27:51.087 --> 00:27:53.131
<i>One. two. three. two. one</i>

468
00:27:53.214 --> 00:27:55.925
<i>One. two. three. four. three. two. one</i>

469
00:27:56.009 --> 00:27:58.303
See? It's very easy. All together now.

470
00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:01.222
<i>One. one. two. one</i>

471
00:28:01.306 --> 00:28:03.558
<i>One. two. three. four. three. two. one</i>

472
00:28:03.641 --> 00:28:05.352
<i>One. two. three. four. five...</i>

473
00:28:05.435 --> 00:28:08.021
No. sorry. there's no five. No five.

474
00:28:09.022 --> 00:28:10.190
We'll start again.

475
00:28:10.273 --> 00:28:13.318
<i>One. one. two. three. two. one</i>

476
00:28:13.401 --> 00:28:14.652
<i>One. two. one</i>

477
00:28:14.736 --> 00:28:16.654
<i>One. two. three. four. three. two. one</i>

478
00:28:16.738 --> 00:28:17.781
<i>One. one. two. one...</i>

479
00:28:17.864 --> 00:28:19.240
- Bang!
- Oww!

480
00:28:20.075 --> 00:28:21.785
<i>One. two. three. two...</i>

481
00:28:27.207 --> 00:28:29.167
<i>Bum-bum. ba-ba-bum</i>

482
00:28:29.626 --> 00:28:30.668
<i>Ba-ba-ba...</i>

483
00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:32.170
- Does it not remind you of...
- No.

484
00:28:33.171 --> 00:28:35.673
<i>You were working as a waitress in a...</i>

485
00:28:35.757 --> 00:28:37.175
<i>Cocktail bar</i>

486
00:28:37.258 --> 00:28:38.426
Does that...

487
00:28:38.718 --> 00:28:39.803
Shall we?

488
00:28:40.011 --> 00:28:41.846
<i>...when I met you</i>

489
00:28:42.305 --> 00:28:45.183
<i>I picked you up. I shook you off</i>

490
00:28:45.266 --> 00:28:47.477
<i>I turned you around</i>

491
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.480
<i>I turned you into someone new</i>

492
00:28:50.563 --> 00:28:51.564
Come on. the chorus.

493
00:28:51.648 --> 00:28:53.691
<i>Don't... Don't...</i>

494
00:28:54.025 --> 00:28:55.610
<i>Don't you want me?</i>

495
00:28:56.152 --> 00:28:57.862
<i>You know I don't believe it</i>

496
00:28:58.113 --> 00:29:00.740
<i>When I hear that you won't see me</i>

497
00:29:00.824 --> 00:29:02.033
<i>Don't</i>

498
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:03.993
<i>Don't you want me?</i>

499
00:29:05.036 --> 00:29:09.416
<i>You know I don't believe it
when I hear that you won't see me</i>

500
00:29:09.499 --> 00:29:11.418
<i>It's much too late to find</i>

501
00:29:11.501 --> 00:29:13.503
<i>That you think
you've changed your mind</i>

502
00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:18.216
<i>You'd better change it back
or we will both be sorry</i>

503
00:29:18.299 --> 00:29:20.677
<i>Don't you want me. baby?</i>

504
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.554
<i>Boom-ba-doop. boo</i>

505
00:29:22.846 --> 00:29:26.433
<i>Don't you want me. oh-oh?</i>

506
00:29:26.766 --> 00:29:29.686
<i>Don't you want me. baby?</i>

507
00:29:29.769 --> 00:29:31.062
<i>Ba-da-ba-ba</i>

508
00:29:31.146 --> 00:29:34.732
<i>Don't you want me. oh-oh?</i>

509
00:29:35.233 --> 00:29:38.236
<i>Don't you want me. baby?</i>

510
00:29:39.571 --> 00:29:43.199
<i>Don't you want me. oh-oh?</i>

511
00:29:46.119 --> 00:29:47.162
Erm...

512
00:29:47.245 --> 00:29:48.872
I was just thinking
we could have a chat

513
00:29:48.955 --> 00:29:50.790
about how we're gonna approach this.

514
00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:53.710
I wasn't aware
we were approaching anything.

515
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.296
- I thought you asked for my help.
- To mobilise them.

516
00:29:56.504 --> 00:29:58.089
- I was thinking...
- Look.

517
00:29:58.506 --> 00:30:02.093
The point of choir isn't to facilitate
what the wives can already do.

518
00:30:02.177 --> 00:30:03.678
It's not sober karaoke.

519
00:30:04.012 --> 00:30:06.181
Choir needs to be challenging
so that for one hour.

520
00:30:06.264 --> 00:30:09.058
they're thinking about something
other than their troubles.

521
00:30:09.934 --> 00:30:11.644
We can't just muddle through.

522
00:30:11.728 --> 00:30:15.148
It needs to be organised. something
we both know is not your strong point.

523
00:30:17.192 --> 00:30:19.152
Can I have my pocket money?

524
00:30:19.235 --> 00:30:21.279
What? You've had it.

525
00:30:24.532 --> 00:30:26.618
You know. you could do something
to earn a bit of extra money.

526
00:30:26.701 --> 00:30:28.703
I'm not stacking shelves
in the NAAFI again.

527
00:30:28.786 --> 00:30:31.581
No. I mean. like. child-minding
for the singing club.

528
00:30:31.664 --> 00:30:33.249
- You could do that.
- I'm all right.

529
00:30:34.334 --> 00:30:36.169
Where are you going?
I'm about to make dinner.

530
00:30:36.252 --> 00:30:38.087
Nowhere. There is nowhere to go.

531
00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:41.466
- Well. what are you gonna eat?
- I might go to the chippy later.

532
00:30:41.758 --> 00:30:43.134
Oh. the chippy?

533
00:30:43.676 --> 00:30:45.512
Good job you've got your leathers on.

534
00:30:45.595 --> 00:30:47.096
You know. and your full face.

535
00:30:47.305 --> 00:30:48.431
For the chippy.

536
00:30:55.355 --> 00:30:57.649
- I want change.
- Bye!

537
00:31:12.372 --> 00:31:14.290
One. two. three...

538
00:31:37.021 --> 00:31:38.356
Oh. my God.

539
00:32:24.527 --> 00:32:26.571
Hey. Kate. you're a soprano.

540
00:32:26.654 --> 00:32:27.989
Yeah. of course you are.

541
00:32:28.072 --> 00:32:30.491
Why don't you take a seat over there
beside Annie?

542
00:32:30.575 --> 00:32:32.410
We're not singing Yazoo?

543
00:32:32.493 --> 00:32:35.580
And don't get used to these.
I don't want you hiding behind them.

544
00:32:35.663 --> 00:32:37.540
- This is only the soprano part.
- Yeah.

545
00:32:37.624 --> 00:32:40.460
- I divide them up into parts.
- How do we know when to come in?

546
00:32:40.543 --> 00:32:43.504
I taught them.
They listened and they memorised.

547
00:32:43.588 --> 00:32:46.215
Oh. Are you going to play that thing
without any music?

548
00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:50.261
Yeah. I just think reading music
makes things a bit stilted.

549
00:32:50.345 --> 00:32:52.555
Oh. not sure Mozart
would agree with that.

550
00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:55.224
Well. The Beatles didn't read music
and I think they did OK.

551
00:32:55.308 --> 00:32:56.809
Yeah. OK.

552
00:32:57.018 --> 00:32:59.020
So we're gonna do
exactly what we did earlier.

553
00:32:59.103 --> 00:33:00.438
I'm gonna give you your starting note.

554
00:33:04.901 --> 00:33:06.110
Three. four...

561
00:33:29.967 --> 00:33:30.968
Yeah. OK.

562
00:33:31.052 --> 00:33:32.053
It was really good. so...

563
00:33:32.136 --> 00:33:36.891
May I suggest we just take a little
time just to learn the parts properly

564
00:33:36.974 --> 00:33:38.643
so that when
we add them all together...

565
00:33:38.726 --> 00:33:40.103
Everyone's lost the will to live.

566
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.523
Let's just sing it again.
Just have one go. right?

567
00:33:43.606 --> 00:33:45.191
- OK. fine.
- Let's just go again.

568
00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:46.734
Absolutely.

569
00:33:49.112 --> 00:33:52.198
Sorry. but. my right hand
will show the tempo.

570
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:54.575
One. two. three. four...

571
00:33:54.659 --> 00:33:57.954
And my left hand is going to
tell you when to come in. Like this.

572
00:33:58.037 --> 00:33:59.956
It's like she's guiding
a plane in to land.

573
00:34:00.039 --> 00:34:01.290
- Finished?
- Yeah.

574
00:34:01.374 --> 00:34:02.834
- And...
- Let's have a...

Right.

629
00:38:15.503 --> 00:38:17.922
I mean. we could leave her
and let her sleep it off.

630
00:38:20.132 --> 00:38:21.258
Yeah. maybe.

631
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.053
Are you sure?

632
00:38:24.679 --> 00:38:25.721
Yeah.

633
00:38:29.976 --> 00:38:32.395
I guess they just need to let off
a bit of steam sometimes.

634
00:38:35.523 --> 00:38:38.526
Yeah. Apparently.
if they see their parents drinking.

635
00:38:38.609 --> 00:38:40.361
they're twice as likely
to do it themselves.

636
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.991
Yeah.

637
00:38:45.074 --> 00:38:46.951

Nope.

Your house is dead tidy.

Then I guess you haven't got anyone
to make it messy. though.

650
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:30.327
I suppose keeping it tidy
gives me something to do.

651
00:39:31.912 --> 00:39:33.497
So you don't think about him?

652

- They talked about you more.

00:40:15.748 --> 00:40:17.833
- You minding kids?
- Do you want to go inside?

663
00:40:17.917 --> 00:40:21.045
I asked her. I hope that's OK.
They are a bit of a distraction.

664

She's going to do it tomorrow as well
while we go for a hike on the moors.

00:40:24.173 --> 00:40:25.257
Right.

666

673
00:40:41.273 --> 00:40:43.109

why shouldn't I?

00:41:33.159 --> 00:41:34.451
<i>You shouldn't have to...</i>

693
00:41:34.535 --> 00:41:38.455
<i>Shout. shout. let it all out</i>

694
00:41:38.539 --> 00:41:42.251
<i>These are the things I can do without</i>

695
00:41:42.334 --> 00:41:43.711
<i>Come on</i>

696
00:41:43.794 --> 00:41:44.795
Lisa?

697
00:41:44.879 --> 00:41:47.590
<i>I'm talking to you. come on</i>

698
00:41:47.673 --> 00:41:49.425
Look. I understand
you want them to be passionate

699
00:41:49.508 --> 00:41:52.261
but really.
it just doesn't sound very good.

700
00:41:52.511 --> 00:41:56.515
They're having fun. Better that
than sounding joyless and in tune.

701
00:41:56.599 --> 00:42:00.603
I don't think projection is our issue.
All the top conductors...

702
00:42:00.686 --> 00:42:03.022
This reminds me of
when my parents got divorced.

703
00:42:44.021 --> 00:42:45.606
Have you got first-aid kit. Crooks?

704
00:42:46.398 --> 00:42:48.442
What's the problem?
I'm the designated first-aider.

705
00:42:48.525 --> 00:42:50.778
Honestly. it's fine.
I just need some plasters.

706
00:42:50.861 --> 00:42:53.781
I'll be the judge of that.
There's nothing I didn't see in Iraq.

707
00:42:58.911 --> 00:43:00.412
It's for Dawn's nipples.

708
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.624
She forgot to wear a bra
and they're chafing.

709
00:43:05.334 --> 00:43:08.212
Erm... you'll find
some plasters in there.

710
00:43:08.295 --> 00:43:10.798
Yeah. I'll bring... Yeah.

711
00:43:18.264 --> 00:43:19.890
Aa-ooh!

712
00:43:23.352 --> 00:43:24.895
<i>Ooh. ooh</i>

713
00:43:24.979 --> 00:43:26.355
Sounds really nice.

714
00:43:27.398 --> 00:43:29.233
That sounds gorgeous!

715
00:43:32.486 --> 00:43:33.654
Keep going. keep going.

716
00:43:33.737 --> 00:43:36.240
<i>Looking from the window above</i>

717
00:43:36.323 --> 00:43:38.325
<i>Like a story of love</i>

718
00:43:38.409 --> 00:43:39.535
- Go on!
- Go on.

719
00:43:40.077 --> 00:43:43.205
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

720
00:43:43.289 --> 00:43:45.874
<i>Came back only yesterday</i>

721
00:43:45.958 --> 00:43:48.752
<i>I'm moving further away</i>

722
00:43:49.712 --> 00:43:53.007
<i>Want you near me</i>

723
00:43:53.757 --> 00:43:57.386
<i>All I needed was the love you gave</i>

724
00:43:58.721 --> 00:44:02.474
<i>All I needed for another day</i>

725
00:44:02.891 --> 00:44:06.353
<i>And all I ever knew</i>

726
00:44:06.937 --> 00:44:07.980
<i>Only you</i>

727
00:44:08.063 --> 00:44:10.232
<i>Ba-da-da. bum-bum</i>

728
00:44:10.316 --> 00:44:12.818
<i>Ba-da-da. bum-bum</i>

729
00:44:12.901 --> 00:44:15.946
<i>Sometimes when I think of her name</i>

730
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:18.991
<i>When it's only a game</i>

731
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.870
<i>And I need you</i>

732
00:44:23.162 --> 00:44:26.123
<i>Listen to the words that you say...</i>

733
00:44:27.708 --> 00:44:30.252
Go on. Jess.

734
00:44:30.336 --> 00:44:32.171
Bravo!

735
00:44:33.672 --> 00:44:35.090
Fifty quid a ticket. mate.

736
00:44:36.425 --> 00:44:38.427
Where are you going?
Where were you hiding that?

737
00:44:40.929 --> 00:44:43.057
Of course the Welsh girl
can bloody sing.

738
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.558
It's all that yodelling
in the valleys.

739
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:46.643
Thank you. kind ramblers!

740
00:44:46.727 --> 00:44:49.521
<i>All of the people. around us they say</i>

741
00:44:49.605 --> 00:44:50.647
I don't know.

742
00:44:51.482 --> 00:44:53.901
Maybe this choir isn't about
singing for ourselves

743
00:44:54.818 --> 00:44:56.528
You know. maybe it's about them
being heard.

744
00:44:59.448 --> 00:45:00.908
Are you suggesting a performance?

745
00:45:00.991 --> 00:45:02.993
Yeah. but. you know. nothing fancy.

746
00:45:03.535 --> 00:45:04.828
Just maybe going to town.

747
00:45:05.662 --> 00:45:06.955
People round here don't know we exist.

748
00:45:07.039 --> 00:45:09.541
But the Military don't want us
to be tall poppies.

749
00:45:10.042 --> 00:45:12.211
- I don't know what that means.
- It means...

750
00:45:12.461 --> 00:45:13.962
It's about appropriateness.

751
00:45:14.505 --> 00:45:18.467
I'm sure between us we can
figure out something appropriate.

752
00:45:19.051 --> 00:45:20.302
That's amazing.

753
00:45:20.386 --> 00:45:22.554
In the market with everyone watching?

754
00:45:22.638 --> 00:45:23.847
It ticks a box. apparently.

755
00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:26.141
The new community covenant
to break down barriers

756
00:45:26.225 --> 00:45:27.393
and engage with the locals.

757
00:45:27.476 --> 00:45:28.727
Can we do Lulu?

758
00:45:29.186 --> 00:45:32.272
What about something modern.
like Rihanna?

759
00:45:32.356 --> 00:45:35.359
<i>- Africa</i> by Toto.
- No. we need <i>Holding Out For A Hero.</i>

760
00:45:35.442 --> 00:45:38.070
- That's a classic.
- No. it has to be something serious.

761
00:45:38.153 --> 00:45:39.863
Bonnie Tyler's got
really serious hair.

762
00:45:40.364 --> 00:45:42.908
- Emotional serious.
<i>- Time After Time.</i> Cyndi Lauper.

763
00:45:43.283 --> 00:45:44.660
I don't think I could do a sad song.

764
00:45:44.868 --> 00:45:47.704
Just sing the tune. Don't think about
the meaning of the words.

765
00:45:47.788 --> 00:45:48.914
Can I do a solo?

766
00:45:51.041 --> 00:45:52.751
I promise I won't lose my nerve.

767
00:45:52.835 --> 00:45:54.503
Mm-hm. Erm...

768
00:45:55.421 --> 00:45:57.923
or. we were actually thinking about...

769
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:00.592
missus there.

770
00:46:02.553 --> 00:46:03.554
No way.

771
00:46:04.805 --> 00:46:06.473
- What? Why?
- No. I can't.

772
00:46:06.557 --> 00:46:09.393
You can.

773
00:46:09.476 --> 00:46:10.561
- You can.
- You can.

774
00:46:14.565 --> 00:46:17.025
One. two. three. four...

775
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:19.236
<i>Lying in my bed</i>

776
00:46:19.319 --> 00:46:21.405
<i>I hear the clock tick</i>

777
00:46:21.488 --> 00:46:23.782
<i>And I think of you</i>

778
00:46:23.866 --> 00:46:27.119
<i>Caught up in circles</i>

779
00:46:27.202 --> 00:46:30.831
<i>Confusion is nothing new</i>

780
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:35.043
<i>Secrets stolen</i>

781
00:46:35.794 --> 00:46:38.380
<i>From deep inside</i>

782
00:46:38.797 --> 00:46:41.425
<i>The second hand unwinds</i>

783
00:46:41.508 --> 00:46:45.345
<i>If you're lost you can look
and you will find me</i>

784
00:46:46.138 --> 00:46:48.223
<i>Time after time</i>

785
00:46:48.807 --> 00:46:53.145
<i>If you fall I will catch you.
I'll be waiting</i>

786
00:46:53.479 --> 00:46:56.064
<i>Time after time</i>

787
00:46:57.024 --> 00:47:00.277
<i>Sometimes you picture me</i>

788
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.072
<i>I'm walking too far ahead</i>

789
00:47:05.449 --> 00:47:08.535
<i>You're calling to me</i>

790
00:47:08.619 --> 00:47:12.498
<i>I can't hear what you've said</i>

791
00:47:12.956 --> 00:47:16.543
<i>Secrets stolen</i>

792
00:47:16.627 --> 00:47:19.296
<i>From deep inside</i>

793
00:47:19.922 --> 00:47:22.549
<i>The drum beats out of time</i>

794
00:47:22.633 --> 00:47:26.553
<i>If you're lost
you can look and you will find me</i>

795
00:47:26.637 --> 00:47:28.680
<i>Time after time</i>

796
00:47:29.306 --> 00:47:31.475
<i>If you fall
I will catch you. I'll be waiting</i>

797
00:47:31.558 --> 00:47:33.393
<i>I will be waiting</i>

798
00:47:33.602 --> 00:47:35.687
<i>I will be waiting</i>

799
00:47:36.855 --> 00:47:39.066
<i>I will be waiting</i>

800
00:47:39.149 --> 00:47:41.735
<i>Time after time</i>

801
00:47:41.985 --> 00:47:43.946
<i>If you fall. I will catch you
I'll be waiting</i>

802
00:47:44.279 --> 00:47:46.823
<i>I will be waiting...</i>

803
00:47:47.491 --> 00:47:50.244
All seems first-rate.
Same time next month. then.

804
00:47:50.327 --> 00:47:53.330
Let me just show you what the women
have been up to since your last visit.

805
00:47:55.457 --> 00:47:57.584
<i>...too far ahead</i>

806
00:47:57.668 --> 00:48:00.629
<i>You're calling to me</i>

807
00:48:00.712 --> 00:48:03.799
<i>I can't hear what you have said</i>

808
00:48:03.882 --> 00:48:07.052
HQ are going to love this. Fits in
perfectly with the new directives.

809
00:48:07.135 --> 00:48:09.846
You should have heard them
on the hike. sir. We were in...

810
00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:11.473
Thank you. Captain. My car's waiting.

811
00:48:12.808 --> 00:48:15.394
<i>The drum beats out of time</i>

812
00:48:15.477 --> 00:48:19.398
<i>If you're lost
you can look and you will find me</i>

813
00:48:20.399 --> 00:48:22.359
<i>Time after time</i>

814
00:48:22.985 --> 00:48:24.861
<i>If you fall. I will catch you...</i>

815
00:48:24.945 --> 00:48:27.072
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

816
00:48:27.698 --> 00:48:29.783
<i>Time after time</i>

817
00:48:30.325 --> 00:48:34.580
<i>If you're lost
you can look and you will find me</i>

818
00:48:35.038 --> 00:48:38.667
<i>Time after time</i>

819
00:48:38.917 --> 00:48:40.919
<i>Time after time</i>

820
00:48:41.169 --> 00:48:45.966
<i>If you fall. I will catch you...
I will be waiting</i>

821
00:48:46.174 --> 00:48:48.385
<i>Time after time</i>

822
00:48:48.719 --> 00:48:52.431
<i>If you're lost.

823
00:48:53.307 --> 00:48:55.225
<i>Time after time</i>

00:48:55.809 --> 00:48:59.563
<i>If you fall. I will catch you...

825
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:02.858
<i>Time after time</i>

826
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:05.110
<i>Time after time</i>

827
00:49:05.193 --> 00:49:06.570
I need to speak to you all.

828
00:49:06.653 --> 00:49:10.073
Oh. Jesus. Is it about the
blow-up doll we sent out to Bastion?

829
00:49:13.577 --> 00:49:14.578
She's joking.

830
00:49:16.038 --> 00:49:19.333
Brigadier Groves heard you rehearsing
when he was here a few weeks ago.

831
00:49:19.916 --> 00:49:21.251
He's told the top brass.

832
00:49:25.881 --> 00:49:28.592
And you've been invited to sing
at the Festival of Remembrance.

833
00:49:30.844 --> 00:49:31.928
What?

834
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.015
The Festival of Remembrance on TV?

835
00:49:36.767 --> 00:49:38.226
- The big one?
- That one.

836
00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:39.519
At the Royal Albert Hall?

837
00:49:48.153 --> 00:49:49.738
I can't wait to tell my mum.

838
00:49:50.155 --> 00:49:52.115
Do you reckon the lads will be able
to see it out in Afghan?

839
00:49:52.199 --> 00:49:54.534
- Hope not.
- You don't need to worry.

840
00:49:54.618 --> 00:49:56.745
We are gonna be match fit
after that market gig.

841
00:49:56.828 --> 00:49:59.456
It's all right for you. Maz.
You haven't got to do a solo.

842
00:49:59.581 --> 00:50:02.209
Just see the market
as a dress rehearsal.

843
00:50:02.292 --> 00:50:05.170
And I'll be by your side.
Like shoulder buddies.

844
00:50:05.253 --> 00:50:07.839
Eh? Come on. cheer up.

845
00:50:07.923 --> 00:50:09.383
You're not helping. Maz.

846
00:50:09.591 --> 00:50:11.510
Is that not helping you?

847
00:50:14.596 --> 00:50:16.139
Stop the war. sign the petition.

848
00:50:16.473 --> 00:50:18.141
Stop the war. sign the petition.

849
00:50:18.225 --> 00:50:20.560
Troops out of Afghanistan.
Stop the war. sign the petition.

850
00:50:20.644 --> 00:50:22.979
Stop the bloodshed.
Troops out of Afghanistan.

851
00:50:23.063 --> 00:50:24.481
Can I interest you in a leaflet?

852
00:50:24.564 --> 00:50:27.401
We don't have the privilege of being
against the war. We're married to it.

853
00:50:28.193 --> 00:50:29.277
Stop it.

854
00:50:35.283 --> 00:50:36.743
Good afternoon. everyone.

855
00:50:37.786 --> 00:50:41.665
We are
the Flitcroft Military Wives Choir.

856
00:50:42.249 --> 00:50:44.626
We'd like to sing for you
this afternoon.

857
00:50:57.973 --> 00:51:00.183
Three. four...

858
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:06.398
<i>Lying in my bed</i>

859
00:51:06.481 --> 00:51:08.817
<i>I hear the clock tick</i>

860
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.986
<i>And I think of you</i>

861
00:51:11.319 --> 00:51:14.448
<i>Caught up in circles</i>

862
00:51:14.531 --> 00:51:17.826
<i>Confusion is nothing new</i>

863
00:51:19.411 --> 00:51:22.456
<i>You say. "Go slow"</i>

864
00:51:23.165 --> 00:51:25.167
<i>I fall behind</i>

865
00:51:25.375 --> 00:51:27.210
<i>The second hand...</i>

866
00:51:27.294 --> 00:51:29.796
<i>The second hand unwinds</i>

867
00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:34.050
<i>If you're lost
you can look and you will find me</i>

868
00:51:34.134 --> 00:51:36.720
<i>Time after time</i>

869
00:51:37.179 --> 00:51:39.681
<i>If you fall
I will catch you. I'll be waiting</i>

870
00:51:39.765 --> 00:51:41.641
<i>I will be waiting</i>

871
00:51:41.725 --> 00:51:44.269
<i>Time after time</i>

872
00:51:44.978 --> 00:51:48.023
<i>Time after time</i>

873
00:51:48.732 --> 00:51:51.526
<i>Time after time</i>

874
00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:52.694
Come on.

875
00:51:52.778 --> 00:51:55.405
<i>Time after time</i>

876
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.547
<i>Time after time</i>

877
00:52:13.465 --> 00:52:14.466
<i>Time after time</i>

878
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:16.092
We'll be laughed out
of the Albert Hall.

879
00:52:18.845 --> 00:52:20.096
I don't want to sing any more.

880
00:52:21.056 --> 00:52:22.641
I'm not a minor. I'm just shit!

881
00:52:22.933 --> 00:52:25.268
Maybe you could silently
mouth the words.

882
00:52:25.852 --> 00:52:26.937
Like Dawn.

883
00:52:31.525 --> 00:52:32.734
Erm... Marilyn?

884
00:52:33.151 --> 00:52:36.738
What does your football coach
say to you after a defeat?

885
00:52:37.197 --> 00:52:39.199
Easy. It's all about control.

886
00:52:39.282 --> 00:52:40.283
Exactly.

887
00:52:40.784 --> 00:52:42.577
A defence-splitting pass.
bring it down.

888
00:52:42.661 --> 00:52:43.995
knock it to the forwards. Boom.

889
00:52:46.957 --> 00:52:49.376
- Look. do you like singing?
- Of course we do.

890
00:52:49.459 --> 00:52:51.670
- Do you like being in the choir?
- Love it.

891
00:52:51.753 --> 00:52:54.923
Think the top brass would've asked you
to sing if you were shit?

892
00:52:55.674 --> 00:52:57.092
No. we just chose the wrong venue.

893
00:52:57.175 --> 00:52:59.135
- Yeah. and that was our fault.
- Exactly.

894
00:52:59.219 --> 00:53:02.472
Do you want to give up because of that
or work harder

895
00:53:02.556 --> 00:53:03.723
so we really kill it
at the Albert Hall?

896
00:53:03.807 --> 00:53:05.225
- Kill it.
- Which?

897
00:53:05.851 --> 00:53:07.018
- Kill it.
- Right.

898
00:53:08.603 --> 00:53:09.980
So how shall we do that. Kate?

899
00:53:11.523 --> 00:53:14.234
Er... well. we choose
a small repertoire.

900
00:53:14.317 --> 00:53:17.445
We practise together and at home.

901
00:53:18.154 --> 00:53:20.115
We tweak. we review. tweak. review

902
00:53:20.198 --> 00:53:22.242
until we come together
like a shoal of fish.

903
00:53:23.952 --> 00:53:26.454
The best Military Wives choir
in England.

904
00:53:26.788 --> 00:53:30.208
Well. the only Military Wives choir
in England.

905
00:53:32.502 --> 00:53:34.129
<i>Come on. girls.</i>

906
00:53:34.212 --> 00:53:36.214
<i>We're singing for England</i>

907
00:53:36.298 --> 00:53:37.799
<i>Eng-ger-land</i>

908
00:53:37.883 --> 00:53:40.010
<i>We're singing in a foreign...</i>

909
00:53:40.093 --> 00:53:42.262
Oi! If I'd done that...

910
00:53:42.554 --> 00:53:43.972
<i>For England</i>

911
00:53:44.055 --> 00:53:47.767
<i>You've got to hold and give
and do it at the right time</i>

912
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:51.688
<i>You can be slow or fast
but you must get to the line</i>

913
00:53:53.648 --> 00:53:55.317
Behold our choir.

914
00:53:55.859 --> 00:53:57.861
Dignified. noble.

915
00:53:58.528 --> 00:53:59.529
Class.

916
00:53:59.613 --> 00:54:02.991
<i>So catch me if you can
cos I'm an England woman</i>

917
00:54:04.159 --> 00:54:05.827
What would your karaoke song be?

918
00:54:06.244 --> 00:54:08.204
Karaoke's my idea of hell.

919
00:54:08.288 --> 00:54:10.165
But if you had to. if you'd no choice?

920
00:54:11.416 --> 00:54:14.336
Well.
I did do <i>Tainted Love</i> once.

921
00:54:14.419 --> 00:54:16.379
But then I drank two bottles
of white wine.

922
00:54:16.463 --> 00:54:17.631
smoked a packet of cigarettes

923
00:54:17.714 --> 00:54:19.966
and threw up
in Richard's parents' garden.

924
00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:22.135
Sounds like a good night.
So <i>Tainted Love?</i>

925
00:54:22.218 --> 00:54:24.220
- No!
- I'll do it with you.

926
00:54:24.304 --> 00:54:26.556
Come on. Imagine their little faces.

927
00:54:27.098 --> 00:54:29.434
Why not? No one's going to remember
in the morning. We're doing it.

928
00:54:30.185 --> 00:54:32.979
Kiki and Elton.
Come on. everyone. this is a classic.

929
00:54:33.897 --> 00:54:35.941
That's a lucky escape. Next one.

930
00:54:39.653 --> 00:54:41.446
<i>Don't go breaking my heart</i>

931
00:54:42.781 --> 00:54:45.241
<i>I couldn't if I tried</i>

932
00:54:46.785 --> 00:54:49.704
<i>Well. honey. if I get restless...</i>

933
00:54:59.172 --> 00:55:01.508
<i>You took the weight off of me</i>

934
00:55:02.634 --> 00:55:05.804
<i>Oh. honey. knock... Knock on my door</i>

935
00:55:06.513 --> 00:55:08.556
<i>Ooh. I gave you my key</i>

936
00:55:10.183 --> 00:55:12.143
<i>Ohhh...</i>

937
00:55:12.227 --> 00:55:13.770
<i>Ooh-hoo</i>

938
00:55:14.145 --> 00:55:16.147
<i>Nobody knows it</i>

939
00:55:23.613 --> 00:55:24.614
Hey.

940
00:55:25.365 --> 00:55:26.783
I wasn't trying to be pushy.

941
00:55:26.866 --> 00:55:29.077
No. no. no.
I just needed some air. that's all.

942
00:55:29.411 --> 00:55:31.955
Yeah. well. Kevin's singing
will do that to you.

943
00:55:41.881 --> 00:55:44.801
Jamie and I sang that song together
at his 18th.

944
00:55:46.261 --> 00:55:47.637
- Oh. fuck.
- Yeah.

945
00:55:50.056 --> 00:55:52.392
He made me. I was mortified.

946
00:55:52.475 --> 00:55:54.060
He. of course.
thought it was hilarious.

947
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:59.441
But then. he thought
his job on this earth

948
00:55:59.524 --> 00:56:01.026
was to keep people laughing.

949
00:56:06.531 --> 00:56:09.868
Yeah. I remember Red saying that
he had a way of looking at things...

950
00:56:10.744 --> 00:56:12.537
he'd just find the funny
in everything.

951
00:56:15.081 --> 00:56:16.374
Even when he was little.

952
00:56:17.083 --> 00:56:20.295
Whenever Richard went away.
we'd have this big jar of sweets.

953
00:56:20.378 --> 00:56:23.423
and Jamie was allowed one sweet a day
every day of the tour.

954
00:56:23.965 --> 00:56:26.259
And when the jar was empty. Richard...

955
00:56:27.218 --> 00:56:28.261
Frankie did that.

956
00:56:28.845 --> 00:56:31.598
Counting down the days till the family
was back together again.

957
00:56:32.348 --> 00:56:35.351
Jamie used to say.
"Until we laugh again."

958
00:56:38.813 --> 00:56:40.440
Mm.

959
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.985
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

960
00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:50.033
I don't know how you...

961
00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.082
Oh.

962
00:56:57.916 --> 00:56:59.167
Right. OK.

963
00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:00.627
I'm off.

964
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:02.712
You don't have to.
I'm not gonna make you sing.

965
00:57:03.004 --> 00:57:04.047
Good night.

966
00:57:05.298 --> 00:57:06.382
Hey. Kate?

967
00:57:06.966 --> 00:57:08.051
The Albert Hall. huh?

968
00:57:08.718 --> 00:57:11.054
Not tall poppies any more.
we're bloody sunflowers.

969
00:57:13.264 --> 00:57:14.265
Night.

970
00:57:16.893 --> 00:57:18.311
<i>If you wanna be my lover</i>

971
00:57:20.396 --> 00:57:22.690
<i>Slam. slam. slam. slam!</i>

972
00:57:22.899 --> 00:57:24.776
<i>If you wanna be my lover...</i>

973
00:57:24.859 --> 00:57:26.569
<i>Slam your body down
and wind it all around</i>

974
00:57:26.653 --> 00:57:28.404
<i>Hup. hup. hup. hup!</i>

975
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.089
- Tell me.
<i>- Comms are down.</i>

976
00:57:46.464 --> 00:57:49.092
<i>Richard's been injured
but he's gonna be OK.</i>

977
00:57:49.217 --> 00:57:50.635
<i>He's in Kabul hospital.</i>

978
00:57:50.969 --> 00:57:53.555
<i>RAMC will fly him back later today.</i>

979
00:57:53.638 --> 00:57:55.557
<i>transfer him straight to Flitcroft.</i>

980
00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.808
Any fatalities?

981
00:57:58.351 --> 00:57:59.352
Handball.

982
00:58:00.019 --> 00:58:01.104
You handballed that.

983
00:58:03.773 --> 00:58:05.358
Skills. Go on.

984
00:58:07.026 --> 00:58:08.278
Gotcha. Ready?

985
00:58:17.579 --> 00:58:18.746
Pass me the ball.

986
00:58:19.539 --> 00:58:20.748
Come on. pass me the ball.

987
00:58:22.125 --> 00:58:23.751
Let's go and get a little biccy
or something. eh?

988
00:58:24.335 --> 00:58:25.461
All right?

989
00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:30.758
- Any pink ones?
- Yeah.

990
00:58:41.102 --> 00:58:43.062
Sarah Cartwright?

991
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:55.241
Who is her trusted friend?

992
00:58:55.825 --> 00:58:59.204
She didn't name anyone. Said she was
waiting to see who she got close to.

993
00:59:02.957 --> 00:59:06.836
Well. Jess is good at stuff like that.
Or Ruby.

994
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:08.796
She's asked for you. Kate.

995
00:59:10.298 --> 00:59:11.507
Says you've been there yourself.

996
00:59:26.105 --> 00:59:27.190
OK.

997
00:59:40.703 --> 00:59:41.788
It's fallen over.

998
00:59:43.331 --> 00:59:44.499
Sorry?

999
00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.751
Liam's teddy's fallen over.

1000
00:59:48.753 --> 00:59:50.255
That doesn't mean anything.

1001
00:59:51.422 --> 00:59:53.549
Of course it does.
because what it means has happened.

1002
01:00:03.226 --> 01:00:04.227
Here.

1003
01:00:06.271 --> 01:00:07.313
Thanks.

1004
01:00:18.074 --> 01:00:19.450
Do I have to leave the base now?

1005
01:00:20.535 --> 01:00:23.162
No. No. whenever you're ready.

1006
01:00:25.331 --> 01:00:26.666
But don't think about that now.

1007
01:00:52.525 --> 01:00:53.526
Right. so...

1008
01:00:54.527 --> 01:00:55.611
shall we give it a go?

1009
01:00:59.532 --> 01:01:01.909
Do you think she's read
Liam's death letter yet?

1010
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.456
I don't think I could read Stu's
if it came to it.

1011
01:01:09.292 --> 01:01:10.501
I read Malc's...

1012
01:01:12.545 --> 01:01:14.255
after the last Afghan tour.

1013
01:01:16.632 --> 01:01:17.717
I'd do it again.

1014
01:01:20.136 --> 01:01:21.429
It helped me. It said...

1015
01:01:23.765 --> 01:01:26.851
all these lovely things about me
that he'd never say to my face.

1016
01:01:30.772 --> 01:01:33.941
To be fair. though. he's not gonna
not write that. is he?

1017
01:01:36.194 --> 01:01:38.654
I mean. he's not gonna write
a list of things he hates about you.

1018
01:01:41.491 --> 01:01:45.161
"Dear Ruby. wish you'd rinse the bath
out after you shave your legs."

1019
01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:48.373
"Dear Jess.

1020
01:01:48.456 --> 01:01:51.584
"really wish you wouldn't wash up
the cups before I'd finished my tea."

1021
01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:54.420
I wish you wouldn't do that.
to be honest. It's so annoying.

1022
01:01:55.296 --> 01:01:57.840
I just can't bear
the thought of anyone

1023
01:01:57.924 --> 01:02:00.259
coming to give me bad news
and the house being a mess.

1024
01:02:05.807 --> 01:02:08.226
I'm not in the mood for singing today.

1025
01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:31.958
Darling.

1026
01:02:34.127 --> 01:02:36.462
This is nothing serious.

1027
01:02:39.507 --> 01:02:41.717
- You're lucky.
- I was stupid.

1028
01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:42.927
Mm.

1029
01:02:45.096 --> 01:02:46.889
Katy. there's something
I need to tell you.

1030
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:49.392
No. you don't.

1031
01:02:50.518 --> 01:02:51.811
- I don't?
- No.

1032
01:02:53.271 --> 01:02:54.522
I know you didn't have to go.

1033
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.607
You put yourself forward.

1034
01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:05.616
You try and file away those feelings
about what happened

1035
01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.493
on the shelves in your head.

1036
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.708
I shouldn't have gone.

1037
01:03:19.672 --> 01:03:22.508
Richard. sorry. I've got so many
things to do. I've got to leave.

1038
01:03:22.592 --> 01:03:23.718
Call you later.

1039
01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:26.679
It's the thing I admire
about you most. the way you cope.

1040
01:03:29.307 --> 01:03:31.350
That is a depressing thing to say.
Richard.

1041
01:03:31.434 --> 01:03:33.102
Are you going to put that
on my gravestone?

1042
01:03:33.186 --> 01:03:36.314
I meant I understand how you feel.

1043
01:03:36.397 --> 01:03:39.525
Oh. you understand?
What do you understand. exactly?

1044
01:03:40.151 --> 01:03:42.278
- Enlighten me.
- No. I just...

1045
01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:44.405
I'm the one who has
to answer the phone in the night.

1046
01:03:44.489 --> 01:03:46.532
who has to worry about
what state you'll come back in.

1047
01:03:46.616 --> 01:03:49.994
who has to...
who has to look at you in that bed

1048
01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:53.080
and then I have to go out there.
I have to get on with it

1049
01:03:53.164 --> 01:03:54.332
and do my duty.

1050
01:03:54.415 --> 01:03:57.251
I have responsibilities.
I can't go round with a wet face.

1051
01:03:57.668 --> 01:04:01.589
"I'm so sorry. my husband's been
blown up. Would you like a cup of tea?

1052
01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:04.467
"I'm so sorry. my husband's
got shrapnel in his head.

1053
01:04:04.592 --> 01:04:05.593
"Have some cake."

1054
01:04:05.676 --> 01:04:08.262
I've always said you should be paid
for what you do.

1055
01:04:35.206 --> 01:04:38.918
Lisa. I can't come to practice now.
I'm at the hospital with Richard.

1056
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:40.044
How is he?

1057
01:04:40.836 --> 01:04:43.631
<i>- He's fine.</i>
- OK. Good.

1058
01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:46.676
- What's the matter?
- No. I just wanted to. erm...

1059
01:04:47.176 --> 01:04:49.804
let you know that you don't need
to worry about the Albert Hall.

1060
01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:51.597
<i>The women don't want
to do it any more.</i>

1061
01:04:52.014 --> 01:04:54.141
- It's a bit late for that.
- I'm sorry?

1062
01:04:54.225 --> 01:04:57.061
It's utterly inappropriate
to pull out now.

1063
01:04:57.144 --> 01:05:00.022
Well. they feel it would be utterly
inappropriate for them to sing.

1064
01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:02.108
Lisa. if we pull out now.

1065
01:05:02.275 --> 01:05:04.652
it will reflect badly on all of us.

1066
01:05:06.153 --> 01:05:07.405
Shit.

1067
01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:20.167
There will be a service
at Camp Bastion.

1068
01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:23.629
Then Liam's body will be repatriated

1069
01:05:23.713 --> 01:05:26.632
on a C-17 aircraft
coming through Wootton Bassett.

1070
01:05:29.802 --> 01:05:33.306
After that. you and his parents are
going to have to make some decisions.

1071
01:05:34.348 --> 01:05:37.184
Well. he grew up in care.
It's just me and the Army.

1072
01:05:39.687 --> 01:05:40.855
And he...

1073
01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:43.024
Did he ever express any wishes?

1074
01:05:45.443 --> 01:05:46.819
No? OK.

1075
01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:51.824
Well. then. we have to decide
what you want.

1076
01:05:51.907 --> 01:05:54.952
whether you want a cremation
or a burial...

1077
01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:57.496
flowers and a reading...

1078
01:06:03.544 --> 01:06:04.587
What did you do?

1079
01:06:06.464 --> 01:06:08.049
Oh. erm...

1080
01:06:09.342 --> 01:06:10.885
James had a willow coffin.

1081
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:14.055
Are they the ones where there's no lid

1082
01:06:14.138 --> 01:06:16.349
and the bodies are covered
with flowers?

1083
01:06:16.432 --> 01:06:18.934
You can do. but Jamie needed a lid.

1084
01:06:23.898 --> 01:06:25.900
Liam's gonna need a lid as well.
isn't he?

1085
01:06:29.362 --> 01:06:31.489
Shall I get that?

1086
01:06:31.572 --> 01:06:32.698
It's OK.

1087
01:06:34.283 --> 01:06:35.451
Right.

1088
01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:43.209
Guys.

1089
01:06:43.918 --> 01:06:45.169
Oh. come in. come in. Come in.

1090
01:06:56.681 --> 01:06:57.682
Guys?

1091
01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.350
OK.

1092
01:06:59.934 --> 01:07:01.185
Sorry. could I...

1093
01:07:02.228 --> 01:07:05.564
Could I just play you something
and ask you a question?

1094
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:12.905
So I first met Liam
when he was put next to me in English.

1095
01:07:13.239 --> 01:07:15.157
He was dead naughty
and I was always a bit of a swat.

1096
01:07:15.241 --> 01:07:17.076
They thought I'd sort him out.

1097
01:07:18.494 --> 01:07:21.539
But our teacher took us on a trip
to York Cathedral.

1098
01:07:21.997 --> 01:07:23.958
And there was a choir practising this.

1099
01:07:24.417 --> 01:07:27.586
Liam hated classical music.
He preferred grime.

1100
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:30.172
But he did always like this.

1101
01:07:31.132 --> 01:07:32.133
This one.

1102
01:07:33.592 --> 01:07:36.887
And he sat next to me to listen to it.

1103
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:39.765
And while it was playing.
he touched my hand.

1104
01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:43.853
And I remember nothing
about the rest of the concert.

1105
01:07:43.936 --> 01:07:45.521
I was too busy thinking
about his hand.

1106
01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:53.279
So that is how I'd really like to feel
when I say bye to him.

1107
01:07:55.656 --> 01:07:59.201
You know. I want to feel
his hand touching mine.

1108
01:08:00.327 --> 01:08:02.413
So I'd really. really love it if...

1109
01:08:03.748 --> 01:08:07.960
if you could sing this for me.
well. for him. at his service.

1110
01:08:31.358 --> 01:08:38.240
<i>Maiden mild</i>

1111
01:08:40.618 --> 01:08:47.583
<i>O. listen to a maiden's prayer</i>

1112
01:08:50.878 --> 01:08:57.802
<i>For Thou canst hear amid the wild</i>

1113
01:09:00.387 --> 01:09:03.307
<i>'Tis Thou</i>

1114
01:09:03.599 --> 01:09:10.564
<i>'Tis Thou canst save amid despair</i>

1115
01:09:13.025 --> 01:09:14.485
Fire!

1116
01:09:18.155 --> 01:09:19.406
Load!

1117
01:09:23.786 --> 01:09:25.287
Fire!

1118
01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:27.957
- It was a beautiful service.
- Thank you.

1119
01:09:28.958 --> 01:09:29.959
Kate.

1120
01:09:31.085 --> 01:09:32.211
It's been far too long.

1121
01:09:33.212 --> 01:09:36.340
I'm really looking forward
to the full choir performance

1122
01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:37.716
at the Festival of Remembrance.

1123
01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.094
Yes. but sadly
we're not going to do it.

1124
01:09:40.302 --> 01:09:41.387
What?

1125
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:44.640
Yes. the women have decided
that it's just too soon.

1126
01:09:52.481 --> 01:09:53.858
You're not doing the Albert Hall?

1127
01:09:54.817 --> 01:09:55.818
Well...

1128
01:09:56.694 --> 01:09:59.029
You sang today and it was beautiful.

1129
01:09:59.113 --> 01:10:00.322
But that was just for you today.

1130
01:10:00.406 --> 01:10:02.074
it was personal.
not for entertainment.

1131
01:10:02.658 --> 01:10:04.577
Guys. make it personal. then.

1132
01:10:05.619 --> 01:10:06.745
Please don't pull out.

1133
01:10:08.622 --> 01:10:11.125
There are gonna be
so many people in that room...

1134
01:10:12.084 --> 01:10:13.252
like me.

1135
01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:16.881
And I want to do this for them.

1136
01:10:17.673 --> 01:10:19.550
But I can't do that on my own.

1137
01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:25.639
- What are we gonna sing?
- Does it have to be classical?

1138
01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:27.266
Dunno.

1139
01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.561
Maybe we should do <i>Angels.</i>
like at Sarah's wedding.

1140
01:10:30.978 --> 01:10:32.521
It's not really about us.
though. is it?

1141
01:10:33.063 --> 01:10:35.107
We're not gonna find anything
that's about us. though.

1142
01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:37.860
Know what song
I've always really liked?

1143
01:10:37.985 --> 01:10:39.695
That Dido one where she goes.

1144
01:10:39.778 --> 01:10:42.615
"I woke up. my tea's cold.
I've got a hangover

1145
01:10:42.698 --> 01:10:43.824
"but you've made everything great."

1146
01:10:43.908 --> 01:10:44.950
That classic!

1147
01:10:45.034 --> 01:10:47.119
It is a classic. it's really personal.

1148
01:10:47.202 --> 01:10:50.205
<i>My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why</i>

1149
01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:52.708
<i>I got out of bed at all</i>

1150
01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:56.211
<i>The morning rain clouds on my window</i>

1151
01:10:56.378 --> 01:10:58.547
<i>And I can't see at all</i>

1152
01:10:58.756 --> 01:11:02.217
And then Eminem. don't say it. starts
rapping about a psychotic stalker.

1153
01:11:03.093 --> 01:11:04.970
Love that at the Royal Albert Hall.

1154
01:11:05.054 --> 01:11:07.014
Maz could do that bit. Bit of rapping.

1155
01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:08.891
- I forgot about that bit.
- Maz and a rap.

1156
01:11:11.101 --> 01:11:12.186
Let's. er...

1157
01:11:13.145 --> 01:11:14.480
Let's just keep thinking. yeah?

1158
01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:16.190
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1159
01:11:16.607 --> 01:11:18.859
- All right.
- Night. Have a good night.

1160
01:11:32.539 --> 01:11:34.333
<i>Yeah!</i>

1161
01:11:45.469 --> 01:11:47.012
Oh. you have a bluey from Dad.

1162
01:11:48.472 --> 01:11:49.515
Right.

1163
01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:11.787
Do you want to watch a film?

1164
01:12:13.998 --> 01:12:14.999
A film.

1165
01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:17.626
Oh.

1166
01:12:18.961 --> 01:12:19.962
Yeah.

1167
01:12:20.045 --> 01:12:21.755
- Yeah.
- What do you fancy?

1168
01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:25.384
I will have a look.

1169
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:34.351
<i>Rocky?</i>

1170
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:38.230
What? Are you serious?

1171
01:12:38.313 --> 01:12:39.314
Yeah.

1172
01:12:39.815 --> 01:12:41.483
- OK. fine.
- Yes. yes!

1173
01:12:45.612 --> 01:12:47.031
<i>That's a good idea. Lisa.</i>

1174
01:12:47.406 --> 01:12:50.409
But the thing is.
all my letters are about QPR.

1175
01:12:51.618 --> 01:12:54.371
Mine are far too mucky.

1176
01:12:55.164 --> 01:12:57.499
We won't put any of the dirty bits in.
We'll just...

1177
01:12:58.167 --> 01:13:01.253
you know. find bits
that represent our feelings

1178
01:13:01.336 --> 01:13:02.963
and just work it into the song.

1179
01:13:03.172 --> 01:13:04.298
Just like that?

1180
01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:06.884
I'm not expecting to win a Brit Award.

1181
01:13:06.967 --> 01:13:08.177
But how bad can it be?

1182
01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:10.429
You've not read what I've written.

1183
01:13:10.512 --> 01:13:14.016
It's not gonna be all. "I love you
to the moon and back" is it?

1184
01:13:14.975 --> 01:13:16.894
I don't want to puke down myself
in the Albert Hall.

1185
01:13:16.977 --> 01:13:20.272
You don't want me to make us
look like meek little women

1186
01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:21.815
pining for our big brave husbands?

1187
01:13:21.899 --> 01:13:23.233
And wives.

1188
01:13:23.317 --> 01:13:25.986
What's wrong with saying.
"I love you to the moon and back"?

1189
01:13:26.737 --> 01:13:29.531
There's nothing wrong
with it at all. Jess.

1190
01:13:29.615 --> 01:13:30.866
It's just a little bit...

1191
01:13:30.949 --> 01:13:32.951
- Sorry.
- Kate?

1192
01:13:33.952 --> 01:13:36.038
Lisa's got an idea
for the Albert Hall.

1193
01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:37.122
Oh. good.

1194
01:13:37.623 --> 01:13:40.417
I was just thinking about
what Sarah was saying...

1195
01:13:40.542 --> 01:13:43.670
about making the song more personal.

1196
01:13:44.379 --> 01:13:45.547
We're gonna write our own song.

1197
01:13:46.632 --> 01:13:48.092
- Using bits of our letters.
- Yeah.

1198
01:13:48.175 --> 01:13:49.968
And putting them to Lisa's tune.

1199
01:13:51.136 --> 01:13:52.137
Oh.

1200
01:13:52.721 --> 01:13:54.765
- Play your song for her.
- Go on. play it.

1201
01:13:55.099 --> 01:13:57.392
It's not a song yet. It's just...

1202
01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:00.187
It's a... You know. it's like a...

1203
01:14:02.231 --> 01:14:05.275
It's a tune.
You have to imagine the words bit.

1204
01:14:13.575 --> 01:14:15.285
Actually. do you think
we could talk about this later?

1205
01:14:18.122 --> 01:14:20.457
Well. why don't we talk about it now?
Everyone's here.

1206
01:14:22.251 --> 01:14:25.671
Really. how realistic is this.
given your limitations?

1207
01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:29.174
- What?
- You can't read music. can you?

1208
01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:34.012
The Festival of Remembrance
is a professional event.

1209
01:14:34.096 --> 01:14:37.975
It's not some amateur
school choir performance.

1210
01:14:38.225 --> 01:14:41.145
We cannot embarrass ourselves
and we cannot let Flitcroft down.

1211
01:14:41.228 --> 01:14:42.354
Do you know what? Forget it.

1212
01:14:44.565 --> 01:14:45.941
Let's go back to the song board.

1213
01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:48.485
Come on.

1214
01:14:49.444 --> 01:14:50.904
I think we should write our own song.

1215
01:14:52.072 --> 01:14:53.073
Lisa. go on.

1216
01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.659
And even if it's not amazing.
at least it's ours.

1217
01:14:56.076 --> 01:14:57.077
Exactly.

1218
01:14:58.203 --> 01:14:59.371
- Agreed.
- Yeah.

1219
01:15:01.623 --> 01:15:02.624
<i>Next up.</i>

1220
01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:06.545
<i>we have the innovative
LED colour-changing shower head...</i>

1221
01:15:06.628 --> 01:15:07.963
You coming to bed?

1222
01:15:09.256 --> 01:15:10.340
I'll be up in a minute.

1223
01:15:12.885 --> 01:15:13.886
OK.

1224
01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:24.897
<i>- Can you believe that?
- That's crazy.</i>

1225
01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:28.525
<i>And it's only £119.99
plus postage and packaging.</i>

1226
01:15:51.506 --> 01:15:55.594
"I swear that...
I keep no secrets from you."

1227
01:15:56.637 --> 01:15:58.722
- OK.
- Embarrassing. that.

1228
01:16:00.432 --> 01:16:01.600
Jess. what have you got?

1229
01:16:02.976 --> 01:16:05.187
The only bit that could really work
in this song.

1230
01:16:06.063 --> 01:16:07.064
is about the moon.

1231
01:16:07.147 --> 01:16:09.733
- I love the moon!
- Go on.

1232
01:16:09.816 --> 01:16:13.612
But it is actually what Stu writes
to me. so I suppose that's OK.

1233
01:16:14.446 --> 01:16:15.530
Erm...

1234
01:16:16.573 --> 01:16:18.951
"At 10 o'clock tonight.
I'll look at the moon.

1235
01:16:19.952 --> 01:16:21.328
That's 1:30 for you."

1236
01:16:21.662 --> 01:16:24.081
And then we look at it...

1237
01:16:26.166 --> 01:16:27.251
...at the same time.

1238
01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:28.627
That's lovely.

1239
01:16:29.127 --> 01:16:30.170
"10 o'clock."

1240
01:16:31.964 --> 01:16:33.048
- Erm...
- Next.

1241
01:16:35.467 --> 01:16:38.512
We don't really go
for all that gushy stuff but...

1242
01:16:38.887 --> 01:16:41.431
Well. we always recognise the unsaid.

1243
01:16:42.766 --> 01:16:44.351
We don't say what we're both feeling.

1244
01:16:45.936 --> 01:16:47.020
What goes unsaid.

1245
01:18:09.936 --> 01:18:11.897
Frankie. can you just not...

1246
01:18:12.773 --> 01:18:13.815
What's the matter with you?

1247
01:18:15.901 --> 01:18:19.154
The matter with me is.
I still haven't finished the song yet.

1248
01:18:20.238 --> 01:18:22.824
I can't... I've run out of bits
from the women's letters.

1249
01:18:22.908 --> 01:18:25.869
- Just make something up.
- I can't make something up.

1250
01:18:26.328 --> 01:18:27.913
I'm padding it out enough as it is.

1251
01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:30.624
Frankie. wait. Sorry.

1252
01:18:33.043 --> 01:18:35.253
Look through these notes.
see if you can find...

1253
01:18:35.337 --> 01:18:37.339
I can't. I'm going out and I'm late.

1254
01:18:39.091 --> 01:18:40.092
Late for what?

1255
01:18:41.343 --> 01:18:42.928
Getting pissed
with rear party soldiers?

1256
01:18:44.054 --> 01:18:46.932
I'm actually going out to child-mind
for your choir

1257
01:18:47.224 --> 01:18:49.267
so that they can try on outfits
for tomorrow.

1258
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.161
So. Tina.

1259
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:10.831
Aretha.

1260
01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.791
Madonna. Cher.

1261
01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:14.751
Where's Dawn? Dawn?

1262
01:19:15.127 --> 01:19:16.169
Sorry. Dawn.

1263
01:19:17.879 --> 01:19:18.880
So come here.

1264
01:19:19.673 --> 01:19:22.426
There's a line I thought could be
really good for a contralto.

1265
01:19:23.677 --> 01:19:25.512
Am I a contralto?

1266
01:19:26.346 --> 01:19:28.014
Yes. I think so.

1267
01:19:30.475 --> 01:19:31.560
Thank you.

1268
01:19:33.353 --> 01:19:34.438
Thank you.

1269
01:19:36.314 --> 01:19:37.774
There's been some tweaks
to the lyrics.

1270
01:19:37.858 --> 01:19:41.236
Don't panic.
cos we'll rehearse it on the bus.

1271
01:19:42.028 --> 01:19:44.406
Whose is that. then.
"Till We Laugh Again"?

1272
01:19:45.198 --> 01:19:46.199
Is that the new one?

1273
01:19:47.075 --> 01:19:49.744
- Where's that?
- At the bottom. "Till We Laugh Again."

1274
01:19:54.166 --> 01:19:57.043
I wanted to clear it with you.
but I just ran out of time.

1275
01:19:57.127 --> 01:19:58.420
There was a gap.

1276
01:19:59.421 --> 01:20:01.381
I mean. everyone else
has something in but...

1277
01:20:04.426 --> 01:20:06.595
I thought it might help you.
you know. sing about him.

1278
01:20:09.014 --> 01:20:10.599
I told you that in confidence.

1279
01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:16.646
Not so that you could use
my child's words...

1280
01:20:18.482 --> 01:20:23.069
to fill a gap in your crass.
sentimental ballad.

1281
01:20:23.403 --> 01:20:24.738
Mum. have you seen my bag?

1282
01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:26.907
- Just get on the bus. Frankie.
- No. I...

1283
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:28.825
- Just get on the bus!
- I should have known.

1284
01:20:28.909 --> 01:20:32.037
I should have known you would
lose sight of what is important

1285
01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:35.999
because you're so obsessed
with your five minutes of fame!

1286
01:20:36.082 --> 01:20:37.459
What are you talking about?

1287
01:20:37.542 --> 01:20:41.421
While you're swanning around. thinking
you're Paul fucking <i>Mull of Kintyre.</i>

1288
01:20:41.505 --> 01:20:46.301
your annihilated daughter is prowling
the streets like a cat on heat.

1289
01:20:46.384 --> 01:20:49.346
Before you know it.
she's gonna be handing out BJs

1290
01:20:49.429 --> 01:20:52.057
or knocked up by some spotty squaddie

1291
01:20:52.307 --> 01:20:54.267
who doesn't know his arse
from his elbow!

1292
01:20:58.396 --> 01:21:00.857
You don't hand out blow-jobs.

1293
01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:02.734
You do them with your mouth.

1294
01:21:03.693 --> 01:21:05.111
Not that I'd expect you to know that.

1295
01:21:05.195 --> 01:21:07.447
You probably tell Richard
"to keep calm and carry on"

1296
01:21:07.531 --> 01:21:08.615
when he's shagging you.

1297
01:21:09.658 --> 01:21:11.993
I never claimed
to be a good songwriter.

1298
01:21:12.077 --> 01:21:14.663
or even a good mum. but I am trying!

1299
01:21:16.164 --> 01:21:19.334
And all you do is
criticise and belittle me.

1300
01:21:19.417 --> 01:21:23.296
But maybe I should have known that.
because you are a cold-hearted...

1301
01:21:23.797 --> 01:21:25.674
uptight bitch. Kate!

1302
01:21:25.757 --> 01:21:28.301
No wonder your husband volunteered
to go back to the war.

1303
01:21:29.302 --> 01:21:32.806
Do you know what?
The bloody choir was your idea.

1304
01:21:33.348 --> 01:21:34.349
Remember?

1305
01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:37.394
You gave me that bullshit speech
about the women needing it.

1306
01:21:37.477 --> 01:21:39.020
That it would bring them together.

1307
01:21:39.312 --> 01:21:41.856
Really. you are the one
that needed the choir.

1308
01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:43.275
because you needed something to do.

1309
01:21:43.358 --> 01:21:44.985
No. we all need something to do.

1310
01:21:45.068 --> 01:21:47.612
No. we don't. Kate.
cos we all still have our kids!

1311
01:22:14.097 --> 01:22:15.515
- Guys. Kate's gone.
- What?

1312
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:19.394
- That's it. I don't know any more.
- Where's she gone?

1313
01:22:19.561 --> 01:22:21.313
- I don't know.
- Kate's gone?

1314
01:22:26.318 --> 01:22:28.320
- Can I borrow your...
- Yeah. sure.

1315
01:22:31.323 --> 01:22:32.824
Erm...

1316
01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:35.327
Er...

1317
01:22:37.871 --> 01:22:39.873
Sorry about the. erm...

1318
01:22:41.583 --> 01:22:42.584
Sorry.

1319
01:22:45.253 --> 01:22:46.630
Can we drive? Can we go now?

1320
01:24:04.666 --> 01:24:05.667
Can I get in?

1321
01:24:21.349 --> 01:24:22.600
What happened to the choir?

1322
01:24:24.394 --> 01:24:25.395
They've gone.

1323
01:24:27.939 --> 01:24:30.150
Lisa used something Jamie said...

1324
01:24:30.567 --> 01:24:32.819
in her song. without asking me.

1325
01:24:37.657 --> 01:24:39.117
"Until we laugh again."

1326
01:24:41.703 --> 01:24:44.581
It's ridiculous. I know
it's just words. it doesn't matter.

1327
01:24:44.664 --> 01:24:46.040
It's not ridiculous at all.

1328
01:24:53.339 --> 01:24:56.050
Oh. God. I said some awful things.

1329
01:24:59.763 --> 01:25:02.599
I behaved so badly. I've let you down.

1330
01:25:02.682 --> 01:25:03.808
No.

1331
01:25:03.892 --> 01:25:05.351
We're both guilty of that.

1332
01:25:13.026 --> 01:25:15.695
I threw my shoes on the ground
like a two-year-old.

1333
01:25:17.822 --> 01:25:21.743
Well. it's no surprise you've come
to hide in Shite Rider. then. is it?

1334
01:25:24.746 --> 01:25:28.249
The car wasn't called Shite Rider.
it was Jamie who was Shite Rider.

1335
01:25:30.919 --> 01:25:32.504
- The car was called Dave.
- Dave.

1336
01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.447
- Is it a panic attack?
- This is gonna be a disaster.

1337
01:25:59.572 --> 01:26:01.616
- It's not.
- I appreciate your optimism.

1338
01:26:01.699 --> 01:26:04.035
- but our last proper performance...
- Our only proper performance...

1339
01:26:04.118 --> 01:26:05.245
...was a complete shit storm.

1340
01:26:05.328 --> 01:26:07.288
And there wasn't any last-minute
lyric changes.

1341
01:26:07.372 --> 01:26:09.749
- Lisa wasn't spinning out.
- And we had Kate.

1342
01:26:33.815 --> 01:26:35.191
Let's take him for a spin.

1343
01:26:36.693 --> 01:26:37.777
Blow the cobwebs out.

1344
01:26:39.737 --> 01:26:40.822
It'll never work.

1345
01:26:41.865 --> 01:26:42.907
Try.

1346
01:26:46.077 --> 01:26:48.496
Come on. Dave.

1347
01:26:50.081 --> 01:26:51.291
- No.
- Try again.

1348
01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:55.712
No. Nothing there.

1349
01:27:04.929 --> 01:27:05.972
Hey.

1350
01:27:08.558 --> 01:27:09.601
Nice to get out.

1351
01:27:16.357 --> 01:27:17.400
I'm sorry.

1352
01:27:19.485 --> 01:27:22.614
I know how I've been acting with you.
I know I've been hard on you.

1353
01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:28.620
I made so many mistakes
when I was young. Frankie.

1354
01:27:28.703 --> 01:27:30.038
I just don't want the same for you.

1355
01:27:32.665 --> 01:27:33.708
I love you.

1356
01:27:35.168 --> 01:27:38.212
And when I was looking
through those letters to your dad.

1357
01:27:38.296 --> 01:27:39.464
you know. for the song...

1358
01:27:41.007 --> 01:27:42.634
they were all about you.

1359
01:27:57.607 --> 01:27:58.816
- Take the strain.
- Yeah.

1360
01:27:59.067 --> 01:28:00.610
- OK. push!
- I am.

1361
01:28:00.693 --> 01:28:03.947
- Come on. put your back into it.
- I am pushing. Stop complaining.

1362
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:05.823
- I'm injured.
- Stop being such a martyr.

1363
01:28:05.907 --> 01:28:08.826
It hurts! Come on. top of the hill
and gravity will do the rest.

1364
01:28:22.423 --> 01:28:23.424
That's it.

1365
01:28:24.842 --> 01:28:26.844
All right. Go on. then. Jump in.

1366
01:28:26.928 --> 01:28:28.221
I'm getting in.

1367
01:28:29.514 --> 01:28:31.182
Right. we can let the hill
do the work now.

1368
01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:33.101
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1369
01:28:33.184 --> 01:28:34.227
OK.

1370
01:28:34.352 --> 01:28:35.895
Come on.

1371
01:28:35.979 --> 01:28:38.773
Come on. jibble it.

1372
01:28:40.817 --> 01:28:43.903
Come on. come on! Come on. Dave!

1373
01:28:43.987 --> 01:28:46.322
Whoa-ho!

1374
01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:03.423
Oh.

1375
01:29:04.382 --> 01:29:05.383
Well?

1376
01:29:37.457 --> 01:29:38.499
Oh. my God.

1377
01:29:47.717 --> 01:29:50.011
- How tall is that?
- I'm really nervous now.

1378
01:29:50.094 --> 01:29:52.847
- ...it's like security.
- We're never gonna get in.

1379
01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:54.682
Yeah. you're not allowed!

1380
01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:56.851
Oh. my God!

1381
01:30:04.776 --> 01:30:06.402
Let's just all gather together here.

1382
01:30:06.486 --> 01:30:09.363
Flitcroft Choir? You're on stage in 30
for a sound check.

1383
01:30:09.447 --> 01:30:12.784
We know where we're going.
Everyone stick together.

1384
01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:18.915
Ladies and gentlemen.
the Flitcroft Choir!

1385
01:30:18.998 --> 01:30:20.416
Yeah!

1386
01:30:28.382 --> 01:30:29.842
Katy. I need to ask you something.

1387
01:30:30.635 --> 01:30:33.971
The airing cupboard
has some new additions.

1388
01:30:35.807 --> 01:30:37.558
Well. I needed something to lean on.

1389
01:30:37.892 --> 01:30:39.727
Would you prefer
that I drank or gambled?

1390
01:30:39.811 --> 01:30:42.230
No. of course not. Fair enough.

1391
01:30:42.313 --> 01:30:45.775
A juicer...
a meat slicer's a bit more tenuous.

1392
01:30:45.858 --> 01:30:47.068
But... But...

1393
01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:51.072
250 quid on
an inflatable bed for a gorilla?

1394
01:30:51.155 --> 01:30:52.365
Well. it's not for a gorilla.

1395
01:30:52.448 --> 01:30:54.534
it's just to illustrate
its weight capacity.

1396
01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:58.913
Oh...

1397
01:30:58.996 --> 01:31:00.957
Oh. piss off. Richard!

1398
01:31:05.378 --> 01:31:07.755
<i>Flitcroft Choir.
please take your positions</i>

1399
01:31:07.839 --> 01:31:10.716
<i>on the risers for sound check.</i>

1400
01:31:11.551 --> 01:31:13.469
On the podium thing.

1401
01:31:14.262 --> 01:31:16.556
- Just find our spots.
- Camera three.

1402
01:31:20.351 --> 01:31:22.687
- What are you doing?
- Checking my heart rate.

1403
01:31:23.104 --> 01:31:24.605
You look like you're choking yourself.

1404
01:31:27.567 --> 01:31:30.236
OK. so we've got three hours.

1405
01:31:30.695 --> 01:31:32.196
OK. we've got three...

1406
01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.240
Where's Jess?

1407
01:31:34.365 --> 01:31:35.825
Oh. she's here.

1408
01:31:39.954 --> 01:31:42.081
What's the matter with her?
Did she faint?

1409
01:31:42.165 --> 01:31:43.207
She's meditating.

1410
01:31:43.291 --> 01:31:46.419
She can't lay down properly cos
she's come out in a rash on her arse.

1411
01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.921
Right.

1412
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:58.681
Can you just. like.
get into your groups?

1413
01:32:00.725 --> 01:32:02.185
It sounded like you were...

1414
01:32:02.268 --> 01:32:03.769
Right. then. ladies.

1415
01:32:04.312 --> 01:32:05.396
How are we all...

1416
01:32:07.732 --> 01:32:08.941
I'm shitting my pants!

1417
01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:11.110
OK?

1418
01:32:11.527 --> 01:32:12.528
Very good.

1419
01:32:13.279 --> 01:32:14.363
Carry on.

1420
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:18.034
There's been a bit of discussion about
that lyric change. We're confused.

1421
01:32:18.117 --> 01:32:19.202
We're not doing Kate's lyric.

1422
01:32:19.744 --> 01:32:23.664
We're just gonna do a repeat
of the second part of the first verse.

1423
01:32:23.748 --> 01:32:26.542
Erm... so let's...

1424
01:32:27.585 --> 01:32:28.586
Let's...

1425
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:31.881
Let's start by running up some...
Stop talking.

1426
01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:34.008
Let's start by running up some scales.

1427
01:32:35.676 --> 01:32:37.386
<i>One. one. two. one...</i>

1428
01:32:37.762 --> 01:32:39.513
<i>One. two. three. two. one...</i>

1429
01:32:39.597 --> 01:32:42.099
<i>- One. two. three. four...
- ...three. four. five...</i>

1430
01:32:42.183 --> 01:32:43.226
Not five!

1431
01:32:43.809 --> 01:32:46.979
Start again. Let's just all sing
at the same time. OK?

1432
01:32:48.105 --> 01:32:49.232
Do it together. It's fun.

1433
01:32:50.942 --> 01:32:52.610
And smiles. Enjoy it.

1434
01:32:52.693 --> 01:32:54.904
Maybe you should go and get some air.

1435
01:32:55.696 --> 01:32:56.697
Just take five minutes.

1436
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:59.533
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah.

1437
01:32:59.617 --> 01:33:00.618
OK.

1438
01:33:01.369 --> 01:33:02.370
Yeah.

1439
01:33:02.954 --> 01:33:04.038
All right. you...

1440
01:33:13.798 --> 01:33:15.299
All right?

1441
01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:17.969
Piss off!

1442
01:33:18.886 --> 01:33:19.929
Can you zip me up?

1443
01:33:25.017 --> 01:33:27.144
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
take your seats.</i>

1444
01:33:27.228 --> 01:33:28.437
Thank you.

1445
01:33:28.521 --> 01:33:32.566
<i>...members in the Grand Tier
please use entrances M to S.</i>

1446
01:33:32.942 --> 01:33:36.946
<i>Those with tickets to the Second Tier.
please use A to F.</i>

1447
01:33:37.029 --> 01:33:38.072
Thanks.

1448
01:33:38.739 --> 01:33:40.574
Good luck.
You'll be marvellous!

1449
01:34:04.807 --> 01:34:05.808
Kate!

1450
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:11.564
I am so sorry.

1451
01:34:11.647 --> 01:34:13.649
Oh. Jesus. I'm... I'm sorry.

1452
01:34:15.151 --> 01:34:16.694
I'm really. really sorry.

1453
01:34:23.451 --> 01:34:25.703
- I changed the lyric.
- No.

1454
01:34:27.413 --> 01:34:28.706
No. you didn't have to do that.

1455
01:34:30.583 --> 01:34:33.127
Lisa. your song is beautiful.

1456
01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:38.883
And I will be proud to stand
next to you and sing it.

1457
01:34:39.967 --> 01:34:40.968
Really?

1458
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:43.512
OK.

1459
01:34:45.514 --> 01:34:47.558
- Right. are they ready?
- Yeah.

1460
01:34:47.975 --> 01:34:50.603
Er... no. No. they didn't want
to go on without you.

1461
01:34:51.145 --> 01:34:52.313
Oh.

1462
01:34:52.396 --> 01:34:55.733
It's after what I said to you earlier.
I think they're fucking scared of me.

1463
01:34:55.816 --> 01:34:58.402
- You've got one hour.
- You look gorgeous.

1464
01:34:58.736 --> 01:35:00.071
Not the boots. but...

1465
01:35:13.167 --> 01:35:15.169
I know it's gonna be louder.

1466
01:35:15.878 --> 01:35:16.879
Kate!

1467
01:35:18.172 --> 01:35:20.424
- Oh. my God!
- Flipping heck!

1468
01:35:21.133 --> 01:35:22.802
You made it.

1469
01:35:23.135 --> 01:35:24.804
That's enough. that's enough.

1470
01:35:24.887 --> 01:35:26.555
Quiet everyone. please.

1471
01:35:26.639 --> 01:35:29.809
Listen to Lisa. she has
something very important to say.

1472
01:35:30.559 --> 01:35:31.769
- What?
- Yeah. come on.

1473
01:35:34.105 --> 01:35:35.314
Oh. shit.

1474
01:35:36.941 --> 01:35:37.942
Er...

1475
01:35:39.402 --> 01:35:41.028
Erm... OK.

1476
01:35:44.073 --> 01:35:46.951
I dunno. Great music.
it doesn't happen when...

1477
01:35:47.535 --> 01:35:48.702
things are perfect.

1478
01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:50.955
It happens when you care.

1479
01:35:51.622 --> 01:35:53.124
I know you all really care.

1480
01:35:57.211 --> 01:35:58.254
Have you seen <i>Rocky?</i>

1481
01:35:59.213 --> 01:36:01.090
Well. you know.
did he win his first fight?

1482
01:36:01.173 --> 01:36:03.926
He doesn't.
He gets the shit beaten out of him.

1483
01:36:05.010 --> 01:36:06.095
In public.

1484
01:36:06.345 --> 01:36:09.181
But does he give up
and sit around crying?

1485
01:36:09.265 --> 01:36:10.558
He does in <i>Rocky Ill.</i>

1486
01:36:13.644 --> 01:36:16.856
Look. I know it feels a bit much
right now.

1487
01:36:16.939 --> 01:36:18.691
going out there and doing that.

1488
01:36:18.774 --> 01:36:19.817
But. Jesus.

1489
01:36:20.651 --> 01:36:22.486
If we can survive
the last five months...

1490
01:36:23.863 --> 01:36:25.281
we can survive five minutes out there.

1491
01:36:26.365 --> 01:36:27.533
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1492
01:36:30.453 --> 01:36:32.872
Every successful choir...

1493
01:36:33.956 --> 01:36:35.499
is just a bad choir
that didn't give up.

1494
01:36:35.583 --> 01:36:37.168
OK. choir.

1495
01:36:37.251 --> 01:36:39.712
You've got ten minutes to get ready.

1496
01:36:40.171 --> 01:36:42.381
And then we are gonna run our song.

1497
01:36:42.923 --> 01:36:44.300
Right. and then we are gonna run it

1498
01:36:45.176 --> 01:36:47.428
and we are gonna run it.
and we are gonna run it

1499
01:36:47.511 --> 01:36:48.804
until we all come together.

1500
01:36:48.888 --> 01:36:51.640
- Like a shoal of fish.
- Right. exactly.

1501
01:36:52.016 --> 01:36:53.017
Like that.

1502
01:36:53.726 --> 01:36:54.727
OK. come on. get ready.

1503
01:36:58.564 --> 01:36:59.982
Ooh. Ooh. Frankie.

1504
01:37:01.817 --> 01:37:03.027
What size feet have you got?

1505
01:37:04.069 --> 01:37:05.196
Why?

1506
01:37:10.326 --> 01:37:11.327
Yeah.

1507
01:37:18.334 --> 01:37:20.002
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1508
01:37:20.294 --> 01:37:23.214
<i>Welcome to this year's

1509

<i>of the men and women of

1512
01:37:31.764 --> 01:37:35.643
<i>and remembers sacrifices made

1513
01:37:45.069 --> 01:37:46.904
- Come and see.
- No. thank you.

1514
01:37:47.238 --> 01:37:48.405
It's like childbirth.

1515
01:37:48.822 --> 01:37:51.033
Best to be completely oblivious
until it's happening.

1516
01:37:55.204 --> 01:37:57.873
<i>Now some performers
you won't have heard of.</i>

1517
01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:00.292

01:38:34.326 --> 01:38:37.788
<i>Feels like forever</i>

<i>But the longer the wait</i>

1524
01:38:41.959 --> 01:38:44.962

1528
01:38:57.641 --> 01:39:01.103
<i>Then I don't know what is</i>

1529
01:39:03.188 --> 01:39:05.441

01:39:05.816 --> 01:39:08.819
<i>How you're really feeling</i>

1531
01:39:10.946 --> 01:39:13.324
<i>But what goes unsaid</i>

1532
01:39:13.741 --> 01:39:16.410
<i>Is what I'm feeling too</i>

1533
01:39:18.704 --> 01:39:21.332
<i>So here we are living</i>

1534
01:39:21.999 --> 01:39:25.377
<i>Life through a letter</i>

1535
01:39:26.754 --> 01:39:29.131
<i>There's nothing I love more</i>

1536
01:39:29.214 --> 01:39:32.968
<i>Than home thoughts from abroad</i>

1537
01:39:34.887 --> 01:39:40.392
<i>At 10 o'clock tonight
I'll be looking at the moon</i>

1542
01:40:01.705 --> 01:40:04.917
<i>Help me get through</i>

1543
01:40:10.464 --> 01:40:13.050
<i>I stand in the storm</i>

1544
01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:17.179
<i>Just me and my sails</i>

1545
01:40:18.305 --> 01:40:21.016
<i>And hope that it blows me</i>

1546
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:24.269
<i>Closer to you</i>

1547
01:40:26.438 --> 01:40:28.315
<i>Secrets keep you sick</i>

01:40:28.399 --> 01:40:32.736
<i>- Secrets keep you sane
- They stop me from sleeping</i>

1549
01:40:34.405 --> 01:40:36.365
<i>I want you to know</i>

1550
01:40:36.699 --> 01:40:39.868
<i>I keep no secrets from you</i>

1551
01:40:42.287 --> 01:40:44.665
<i>You always knew</i>

1552
01:40:44.998 --> 01:40:48.669
<i>How to keep the world laughing</i>

1553
01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.381
<i>Till we laugh again</i>

1554
01:40:52.673 --> 01:40:57.761
<i>These home thoughts from abroad</i>

1555
01:40:58.345 --> 01:41:03.684
<i>At 10 o'clock tonight
I'll be looking at the moon</i>

1556
01:41:04.518 --> 01:41:07.896
<i>That's 1:30 for you</i>

1557
01:41:08.564 --> 01:41:13.652
<i>Will you be up then too?</i>

1558
01:41:13.777 --> 01:41:19.616
<i>I know that if it's shining on me
Then it shines for you</i>

1559
01:41:21.326 --> 01:41:24.413
<i>These simple things</i>

1560
01:41:25.038 --> 01:41:28.542
<i>Help me get through</i>

1561
01:41:51.899 --> 01:41:53.108
Bravo!

1562
01:42:18.509 --> 01:42:20.636
My hands are still shaking.

1563
01:42:20.719 --> 01:42:23.889
<i>Urh... oh... oh... oh</i>

1564
01:42:24.556 --> 01:42:27.100
- Yeah!
- Can we get two bottles of champagne?

1565
01:42:28.018 --> 01:42:29.937
I don't remember what I did.

1566
01:42:30.479 --> 01:42:31.730
Excuse me.

1567
01:42:31.814 --> 01:42:33.398
Do you think I could
get your autograph?

1568
01:42:34.858 --> 01:42:36.235
I haven't got an autograph.

1569
01:42:36.318 --> 01:42:38.779
Just do a symbol. you know.
like Prince.

1570
01:42:42.491 --> 01:42:43.617
Thank you.

1571
01:42:44.493 --> 01:42:45.702
Can I get your autograph. please?

1572
01:42:45.786 --> 01:42:46.787
Get lost.

1573
01:42:47.079 --> 01:42:48.455
I don't need your autograph.

1574
01:42:49.665 --> 01:42:50.916
I've got your number.

1575
01:42:59.967 --> 01:43:01.093
Are you all right?

1576
01:43:01.468 --> 01:43:05.138
Yeah. yeah. I'm not great. obviously.
But. yeah. I'm all right.

1577
01:43:05.222 --> 01:43:08.559
I'm just really gonna miss the choir
when I move home.

1578
01:43:08.976 --> 01:43:09.977
What do you mean?

1579
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:12.729
Your parents only live three miles
up the road from the base.

1580
01:43:13.981 --> 01:43:15.107
Can I stay in the choir?

1581
01:43:15.607 --> 01:43:17.150
Oh. I'll have to think about that.

1582
01:43:19.528 --> 01:43:21.113
Of course you can stay. silly!

1583
01:43:21.697 --> 01:43:22.823
Well done.

1584
01:43:23.448 --> 01:43:25.659
- Well done?
- Yeah. That was really good.

1585
01:43:25.742 --> 01:43:28.537
Oh. my God!
Hang on. just give me a second.

1586
01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.414
Something I did was really good?

1587
01:43:30.497 --> 01:43:32.416
All right. don't be weird about it.

1588
01:43:32.583 --> 01:43:34.334
OK. I won't tell anyone you said it.

1589
01:43:35.252 --> 01:43:37.796
Just myself. sometimes.

1590
01:43:45.721 --> 01:43:47.222
I think we both deserve this.

1591
01:43:47.431 --> 01:43:48.432
Yeah.

1592
01:43:51.268 --> 01:43:52.352
To the choir.

1593
01:43:54.730 --> 01:43:55.731
To the choir.

1594
01:43:57.858 --> 01:43:59.526
Group photo. everyone.

1595
01:44:00.277 --> 01:44:01.486
All right. everybody in.

Everybody.

1597
01:44:04.281 --> 01:44:06.074
Right. ready?

1598
01:44:06.742 --> 01:44:08.452
OK. everyone say. "Cheese!"

1599
01:44:08.535 --> 01:44:11.538
- We did it. ladies.
- Yeah!

1600
01:44:12.706 --> 01:44:14.082
You should feel very proud.

1601
01:44:14.666 --> 01:44:15.834
I'm very proud of you.

1602
01:44:17.252 --> 01:44:18.545
- Hey. Crooks!
- Bye-bye.

1603
01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:20.839
How about enhancing
the spousal experience

1604
01:44:20.923 --> 01:44:23.091
by riding with Richard
so Kate can come with us?

1605
01:44:27.012 --> 01:44:28.096
She's all yours.

1606
01:44:29.514 --> 01:44:31.350
Yeah!

1607
01:44:31.975 --> 01:44:33.268
<i>She's on the coach</i>

1608
01:44:34.436 --> 01:44:35.938
<i>She's on the coach</i>

1609
01:44:36.021 --> 01:44:37.731
- Take care of that. Captain.
- Of course. sir.

1610
01:44:39.024 --> 01:44:40.150
Welcome to Dave.

1611
01:44:50.118 --> 01:44:52.371
Is Sarah here? Did she turn up?

1612
01:44:52.663 --> 01:44:53.705
Oh. she's there.

1613
01:45:05.592 --> 01:45:08.220
We're gonna do the same places
as at the Albert Hall.

1614
01:45:08.303 --> 01:45:11.390
Will you come down? We'll start
with something fun and easy.

1615
01:45:11.807 --> 01:45:13.433
Round the back. There we go.

1616
01:45:18.438 --> 01:45:22.109
<i>Everyone can see we're together</i>

1617
01:45:22.526 --> 01:45:25.320
<i>As we walk on by</i>

1618
01:45:26.405 --> 01:45:29.866
<i>And we fly just like birds
of a feather</i>

1619
01:45:30.534 --> 01:45:32.744

<i>All of the people around us. they say</i>

1622
01:45:38.375 --> 01:45:40.502
<i>Can they be that close?</i>

1623
01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:43.839
