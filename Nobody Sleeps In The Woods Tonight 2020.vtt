00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:22.875
Gym and pool every day.
and weekend marathons?

181
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:23.875
Yeah.

182
00:17:24.916 --> 00:17:26.750
A bit of swimming.

183
00:17:27.708 --> 00:17:29.458
a bit of cycling.

184
00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:32.791
[ominous music playing]

185
00:17:38.833 --> 00:17:40.041
[boy] Hey. Daniel?

186
00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:40.958
[Daniel] What?

187
00:17:42.458 --> 00:17:44.375
-[boy] Are you a selfie fan?
-[Daniel] Jesus!

188
00:17:45.458 --> 00:17:46.291
[boy] What?

189
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.166
Do you like taking selfies?

190
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.958
-[Daniel] Fuck off. pal.
-[boy] You do. don't you?

191
00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:55.875
Do you shave your legs. too?

192
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.833
[Iza] Bartek. let him be.

193
00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:00.833
-[Bartek] Daniel?
-[Daniel] I'll shave yours.

194
00:18:00.916 --> 00:18:04.541
[Bartek] Cyclists shave.
Maybe you are a pro.

195
00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:07.458
-[Iza] Bartek!
-[Bartek] Maybe you like sucking dick.

196
00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:10.458
[Iza] Jesus... Bartek!

197
00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:13.166
-[Bartek] Are you nuts?
-[Iza] What was that?

198
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:14.958
Everything okay?

199
00:18:15.666 --> 00:18:17.041
You're no better than him.

200
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Okay...

201
00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.291
All right. Let's get it cleaned up.

202
00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:28.791
Right. so... enough.

203
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.291
Give me two of those.

204
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.208
You're not so eloquent now. are you?

205
00:18:42.375 --> 00:18:44.500
Okay. Uh...

206
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.833
And now...

207
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:55.375
Gosh. I have no scissors.

208
00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:12.791
All set. Let's move.

209
00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:14.625
Can you get up?

210
00:19:15.708 --> 00:19:17.750
-[Daniel] Sorry.
-[Bartek] I got carried away.

211
00:19:18.666 --> 00:19:20.666
[Julek] Can I go for a quick pee?

212
00:19:21.208 --> 00:19:22.083
[Iza] Hurry up.

213
00:19:22.875 --> 00:19:23.916
Let's get ready.

214
00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:26.208
Backpacks on.

215
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.375
[Aniela] Help me.

216
00:19:32.125 --> 00:19:34.125
[ominous music]

217
00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:36.208
[flies buzzing]

218
00:19:50.916 --> 00:19:51.791
Oh. shit!

219
00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:55.958
Fuck me!

220
00:19:58.375 --> 00:19:59.291
Shit.

221
00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:03.958
Hey! Come over here!

222
00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:27.416
-Hunters?
-Nope.

223
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.791
Not hunters.

224
00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:34.708
A carnivore of some sort.

225
00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:36.416
A big one.

226
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.166
Fifteen thousand people
disappear in Poland each year.

227
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.708
a third of them in the woods.

228
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.750
-We can add to the statistics.
-That's not funny.

229
00:21:02.458 --> 00:21:04.166
[breath trembling]

230
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:17.708
[Bartek]
Is this your first time in a forest?

231
00:21:18.916 --> 00:21:20.750
-Relax.
-That's right.

232
00:21:21.458 --> 00:21:25.583
Animals don't attack for no reason.
And Totter-Tot will protect us.

233
00:21:26.458 --> 00:21:27.375
Let's move on!

234
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:30.958
[Aniela] Ew.

235
00:21:51.041 --> 00:21:53.083
[Julek] That deer was something else.
wasn't it?

236
00:21:54.875 --> 00:21:58.083
Have you watched
An American Werewolf in London?

237
00:21:58.666 --> 00:22:00.583
It goes like this...

238
00:22:00.666 --> 00:22:05.291
Two guys go hiking through the woods.
just like us now.

239
00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:08.916
They walk and hear a kind of growling.

240
00:22:10.291 --> 00:22:12.750
Like a dog or a hare or a wolf.

241
00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:15.583
They ignore it and walk on.

242
00:22:15.666 --> 00:22:17.583
And there's that growling again.

243
00:22:18.666 --> 00:22:20.125
kind of circling them.

244
00:22:20.708 --> 00:22:24.083
They keep walking.
and one of them gets attacked!

245
00:22:24.166 --> 00:22:26.041
He gets his arm bitten off...

246
00:22:26.125 --> 00:22:28.208
[continues indistinctly]

247
00:22:28.291 --> 00:22:30.291
[tense music playing]

248
00:23:09.125 --> 00:23:12.083
[gentle music playing]

249
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.375
[Aniela] Daniel?

250
00:23:39.833 --> 00:23:40.666
[Daniel] Yeah?

251
00:23:41.375 --> 00:23:42.791
I have no idea how to do it.

252
00:23:47.833 --> 00:23:48.750
Maybe like this?

253
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:52.875
I'll do it.

254
00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:57.125
I need to bathe.
I feel icky after that walk.

255
00:24:46.916 --> 00:24:48.458
[Iza] Julek. why are you here?

256
00:24:50.041 --> 00:24:52.125
-[Julek] Gaming.
-[Iza] Computer gaming?

257
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.250
[Julek] Console gaming as well.

258
00:24:57.958 --> 00:24:59.166
[Iza] Go on. Julek.

259
00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:01.166
Everyone shares.

260
00:25:04.416 --> 00:25:05.291
Go on.

261
00:25:06.416 --> 00:25:07.541
I play games.

262
00:25:09.791 --> 00:25:12.250
I'm the second-best player in Poland.

263
00:25:13.583 --> 00:25:16.166
I stream. I run a YouTube channel.

264
00:25:16.708 --> 00:25:18.875
-I was going to fly to...
-[Daniel] How many subscribers?

265
00:25:18.958 --> 00:25:21.875
-...Korea for championships. but...
-How many subscribers?

266
00:25:22.458 --> 00:25:25.958
-I have a channel. too.
-[Julek] Exactly 900.334.

267
00:25:29.833 --> 00:25:30.750
And you?

268
00:25:33.333 --> 00:25:35.916
-More or less the same.
-[Iza] Julek. go on.

269
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.208
You mentioned Korea.

270
00:25:37.708 --> 00:25:39.291
Uh...

271
00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:42.875
I was planning to take part
in the championship games.

272
00:25:44.083 --> 00:25:47.958
but my parents cut me off the internet
and sent me here.

273
00:25:49.083 --> 00:25:51.875
-On probation.
-There are camps in Korea. too.

274
00:25:51.958 --> 00:25:53.958
[Daniel and Aniela snickering]

275
00:25:56.083 --> 00:25:56.916
Joke.

276
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.583
You can win half a million dollars.

277
00:26:00.083 --> 00:26:02.958
[Iza]
So. you dropped out of school because...

278
00:26:04.416 --> 00:26:06.000
you spent too much time on the web.

279
00:26:07.041 --> 00:26:09.708
Who else had problems at school
for the very same reason?

280
00:26:16.958 --> 00:26:17.791
Nobody.

281
00:26:18.291 --> 00:26:19.291
Just like I thought.

282
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.333
And I heard that all of you did.

283
00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:25.166
And it's Zosia's turn.

284
00:26:27.791 --> 00:26:29.083
Zosia Wolska.

285
00:26:31.333 --> 00:26:32.416
What have we here?

286
00:26:33.791 --> 00:26:34.708
Zosia.

287
00:26:35.625 --> 00:26:37.208
Uh. Zosia...

288
00:26:42.875 --> 00:26:43.833
Um...

289
00:26:44.958 --> 00:26:46.666
Let's leave that for tomorrow.

290
00:26:50.291 --> 00:26:52.000
Or whenever you'd like. Okay?

291
00:26:53.125 --> 00:26:55.458
[growling. leaves crunching]

292
00:26:56.916 --> 00:26:58.708
-Did you hear that?
-What is it?

293
00:26:58.791 --> 00:27:01.125
[Iza shushing]

294
00:27:01.208 --> 00:27:02.875
-Something's out there.
-[Iza shushes]

295
00:27:09.333 --> 00:27:11.125
-Sit!
-[Julek] Ow!

296
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.333
Stay put.

297
00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:21.541
[creature growling]

298
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:35.583
[Julek whispers] Miss Iza?

299
00:27:36.666 --> 00:27:39.166
-Yeah?
-[Julek] Be careful.

300
00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:41.000
Good idea.

301
00:28:00.416 --> 00:28:02.833
[whining]

302
00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:05.833
What a cutie.

303
00:28:06.833 --> 00:28:08.291
A little fox.

304
00:28:08.375 --> 00:28:11.666
-I wish you'd seen him. Enough for today.
-[Bartek] You all shit your pants.

305
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:12.708
[Iza] Bedtime!

306
00:28:59.166 --> 00:29:01.041
Puffety puff.

307
00:29:18.791 --> 00:29:19.833
That's better.

308
00:29:30.375 --> 00:29:31.375
Jesus.

309
00:29:33.375 --> 00:29:35.250
Wanna give me a heart attack?

310
00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:38.875
I can't sleep with all that noise.

311
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.375
What noise?

312
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:47.666
All those crickets. owls.
ticks and whatnot.

313
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:48.875
[Daniel] Uh-huh.

314
00:29:51.083 --> 00:29:52.125
And how about you?

315
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.333
-Just chillin'.
-[chuckles] So I see. Give me a hit.

316
00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:00.333
You smoke?

317
00:30:07.958 --> 00:30:09.541
We have similar names.

318
00:30:11.666 --> 00:30:13.333
-[Daniel] Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

319
00:30:14.208 --> 00:30:18.208
Daniel. Aniela. Add a D. take away the A.

320
00:30:18.291 --> 00:30:21.750
Coincidence? I don't think so.
Do you have a girlfriend?

321
00:30:21.833 --> 00:30:23.333
No. I mean. yes.

322
00:30:25.625 --> 00:30:26.625
Sometimes.

323
00:30:27.541 --> 00:30:28.500
You know how it is.

324
00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:31.791
No. I don't.

325
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:33.875
Well...

326
00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:36.750
I date several girls.

327
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.166
Depends on the day.

328
00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:44.750
I've got something. too.

329
00:30:52.333 --> 00:30:53.458
You know what it is?

330
00:30:55.625 --> 00:30:56.958
[Daniel] Mmm-hmm.

331
00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.875
[Aniela] So?

332
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.333
-Meaning?
-You want me to help you?

333
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.958
No. there's no need... I mean. uh...

334
00:31:08.916 --> 00:31:10.000
No.

335
00:31:12.708 --> 00:31:13.916
I don't need help.

336
00:31:24.083 --> 00:31:24.958
What's wrong?

337
00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:30.333
Nothing. Uh...

338
00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:33.333
You're gay?

339
00:31:34.708 --> 00:31:35.583
No.

340
00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:38.500
I just...

341
00:31:41.583 --> 00:31:42.583
It's the nerves.

342
00:31:45.083 --> 00:31:45.958
I don't know...

343
00:31:46.875 --> 00:31:48.083
[laughs]

344
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.625
No!

345
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.791
You're a virgin?

346
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:02.416
-And you said you had someone.
-I did.

347
00:32:04.583 --> 00:32:06.750
-Over the internet.
-Mmm.

348
00:32:08.541 --> 00:32:10.208
So you've had cybersex only?

349
00:32:14.708 --> 00:32:15.583
Sorry.

350
00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:35.583
In that case. call me "Teacher."

351
00:32:59.208 --> 00:33:00.666
[Aniela moaning]

352
00:33:26.416 --> 00:33:29.958
[Daniel moaning]

353
00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:44.166
How was it?

354
00:33:48.583 --> 00:33:51.291
-[exhales heavily]
-[chuckles]

355
00:33:53.333 --> 00:33:54.375
[Aniela] I need to crash.

356
00:33:55.583 --> 00:33:57.250
[Daniel] But we'll do it again. right?

357
00:33:58.083 --> 00:33:59.125
[Aniela chuckles]

358
00:33:59.708 --> 00:34:02.500
[Aniela] We'll see. Goodnight!

359
00:34:04.166 --> 00:34:05.041
[Daniel] Thanks.

360
00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:25.541
Wait.

361
00:34:26.833 --> 00:34:27.958
Let's get this out.

362
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:30.583
Right.

363
00:34:31.458 --> 00:34:32.833
Before falling asleep.

364
00:34:37.166 --> 00:34:38.125
Oh.

365
00:34:42.958 --> 00:34:44.333
Mmm...

366
00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.291
[monster growling]

367
00:35:23.791 --> 00:35:25.500
[Daniel screaming]

368
00:35:54.875 --> 00:35:56.458
[laughing]

369
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.916
[imperceptible]

370
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.166
[dramatic music playing]

371
00:36:46.541 --> 00:36:48.500
-[tires screeching]
-[woman screams]

372
00:36:48.583 --> 00:36:50.916
[Iza] Julek! Wake Zosia and Daniel up.

373
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.583
-[Julek] He's not here.
-[Iza] What do you mean?

374
00:36:55.625 --> 00:36:58.041
[Julek] He is not here.
He's not in his tent.

375
00:36:59.291 --> 00:37:02.208
-[Bartek] Maybe he went to shave his legs.
-[Iza] So where is he?

376
00:37:02.291 --> 00:37:03.791
Anyone seen Daniel?

377
00:37:04.958 --> 00:37:08.541
-Did he say he was leaving?
-[Julek] How should I know?

378
00:37:09.833 --> 00:37:13.250
-[Iza] Who's seen him last?
-[Julek] Maybe something happened to him?

379
00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:26.125
All right.

380
00:37:26.916 --> 00:37:28.458
Who was the last person to see him?

381
00:37:36.166 --> 00:37:39.125
Me. We sat by the water together.

382
00:37:40.166 --> 00:37:41.041
[Iza] And?

383
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.291
"Now I'm pregnant."

384
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.875
Show me the exact spot.

385
00:37:59.458 --> 00:38:01.125
[Aniela] Uh. that's not mine.

386
00:38:06.166 --> 00:38:09.125
-[Bartek] What else did you two do?
-[Aniela] Nothing.

387
00:38:10.791 --> 00:38:12.458
[Bartek] You had to do something.

388
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:14.916
[Aniela] We sat. We chatted.
I went to bed.

389
00:38:16.916 --> 00:38:18.458
[Bartek] That's cool.

390
00:38:19.375 --> 00:38:22.791
-What did you talk about?
-[Aniela] Just piss off.

391
00:38:23.833 --> 00:38:25.833
-[Bartek] Why won't you tell me?
-[Aniela] Fuck off.

392
00:38:25.916 --> 00:38:26.916
[Zosia] Hey!

393
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.916
Take a look.

394
00:38:37.791 --> 00:38:38.750
Looks like blood.

395
00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:41.916
-[Bartek] That's massive.
-[Iza] What's up?

396
00:38:44.458 --> 00:38:45.333
[Zosia] Blood.

397
00:38:49.833 --> 00:38:50.791
No. that is...

398
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:56.791
-[Bartek] What?
-[Iza] That is probably sap.

399
00:38:57.833 --> 00:39:02.500
-[Aniela] Sap of that color?
-[Iza] Sure. Lots of trees secrete juices.

400
00:39:02.583 --> 00:39:03.458
What are they called?

401
00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:06.250
-[Iza] Their color is similar to...
-[Julek] They don't grow in Poland.

402
00:39:06.333 --> 00:39:09.000
-[Iza] They sometimes do.
-[Julek] Like where?

403
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.083
-[Iza] Like here.
-[Aniela] That's blood.

404
00:39:12.166 --> 00:39:13.000
No.

405
00:39:14.416 --> 00:39:15.791
No. That's...

406
00:39:15.875 --> 00:39:18.291
Listen. stop panicking. all right?

407
00:39:18.375 --> 00:39:21.125
-[Bartek] We should look for him.
-[Julek] Or head back.

408
00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:23.666
[Bartek] Okay. go back. We'll look.

409
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:26.000
Let's take a vote. I say we get back.

410
00:39:26.083 --> 00:39:28.541
[Iza] Stop panicking. All right.

411
00:39:28.625 --> 00:39:32.458
Bartek and Aniela stay here
in case Daniel shows up.

412
00:39:32.541 --> 00:39:33.916
Don't go anywhere. Clear?

413
00:39:34.833 --> 00:39:38.541
-Zosia and I will look around.
-[Julek] So we split up?

414
00:39:38.625 --> 00:39:41.125
-[Iza] We have to.
-Can I say something?

415
00:39:41.208 --> 00:39:43.208
-[Iza] Be brief.
-In horror movies.

416
00:39:43.291 --> 00:39:47.541
when groups split up. people die.

417
00:39:47.625 --> 00:39:49.583
-[Iza] Julek. please!
-Relax.

418
00:39:50.375 --> 00:39:54.791
I'd feel more relaxed
if we called the police.

419
00:39:54.875 --> 00:39:56.791
We have no phones.

420
00:39:56.875 --> 00:40:01.500
If we don't find him in an hour.
we'll head back to base. Clear?

421
00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:02.583
-[Bartek] Yeah.
-Let's go.

422
00:40:03.291 --> 00:40:06.250
-And what about me?
-I don't know... Stay.

423
00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:07.958
Wait for the police.

424
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.166
[Bartek] What a bummer.

425
00:40:21.375 --> 00:40:22.250
[Iza] Daniel!

426
00:40:23.833 --> 00:40:25.083
[Zosia] Daniel!

427
00:40:28.791 --> 00:40:31.083
-[Julek] Can I say one more thing?
-[Iza] No!

428
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:39.291
In horror movies.
there are six deadly sins.

429
00:40:41.583 --> 00:40:45.208
Curiosity. "I wonder what's inside.
Let's take a peep."

430
00:40:46.083 --> 00:40:47.250
Disbelief.

431
00:40:48.875 --> 00:40:51.541
"It's just my imagination.
No need to fear."

432
00:40:52.125 --> 00:40:55.791
Confidence. "I'm going inside.
Why shouldn't I?"

433
00:40:57.416 --> 00:40:58.541
That was number three.

434
00:40:59.541 --> 00:41:03.166
Number four.
unattractive people never survive.

435
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.541
Five. sex.

436
00:41:05.791 --> 00:41:07.416
Sex is a death sentence.

437
00:41:08.708 --> 00:41:12.000
And six. splitting up.
just like we are doing now.

438
00:41:14.416 --> 00:41:15.291
Let me.

439
00:41:16.458 --> 00:41:17.333
Thanks.

440
00:41:24.541 --> 00:41:26.375
What if they don't come back?

441
00:41:30.375 --> 00:41:31.750
Why shouldn't they?

442
00:41:34.916 --> 00:41:35.750
No idea.

443
00:41:37.291 --> 00:41:38.291
Hypothetically.

444
00:41:40.291 --> 00:41:42.875
If we were to be left alone here...

445
00:41:46.083 --> 00:41:47.000
what would you do?

446
00:41:50.166 --> 00:41:51.166
Hmm...

447
00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:07.916
What's that?

448
00:42:10.833 --> 00:42:11.875
Let's get in.

449
00:42:12.708 --> 00:42:16.250
-But it's private property.
-[Iza] Julek!

450
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.791
Give it a break.
Maybe they've seen Daniel.

451
00:42:22.458 --> 00:42:23.666
I won't squeeze through.

452
00:42:27.666 --> 00:42:28.541
[Iza] Hello?

453
00:42:36.583 --> 00:42:38.166
[Julek] What a fucking mess.

454
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:39.750
[flies buzzing]

455
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:53.791
[knocking on door]

456
00:42:54.708 --> 00:42:55.541
[Iza] Hello?

457
00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:01.833
Good morning!

458
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:06.541
[bell rings]

459
00:43:10.625 --> 00:43:12.583
[fly buzzes]

460
00:43:13.458 --> 00:43:14.416
Is anybody here?

461
00:43:15.666 --> 00:43:16.541
Excuse me.

462
00:44:06.541 --> 00:44:08.541
[ominous music]

463
00:44:25.583 --> 00:44:27.500
No one's here. Let's get back.

464
00:44:31.916 --> 00:44:34.000
[banging]

465
00:44:37.333 --> 00:44:39.083
-Did you hear that?
-Yes.

466
00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:51.041
-[mouse squeaking]
-Oh! Hi. little one.

467
00:44:51.916 --> 00:44:53.000
[groans]

468
00:44:57.666 --> 00:44:58.541
Wait. wait...

469
00:45:03.208 --> 00:45:04.125
Miss Iza...

470
00:45:04.916 --> 00:45:07.000
-Miss Iza...
-[Iza shushing]

471
00:45:07.916 --> 00:45:09.208
Zosia. be careful.

472
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:43.416
Oh. Jesus.

473
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:53.958
[banging]

474
00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:03.125
[breathing heavily]

475
00:46:08.125 --> 00:46:09.208
Someone's coming!

476
00:46:09.291 --> 00:46:11.291
[tense music]

477
00:46:15.666 --> 00:46:16.666
Let's fucking run!

478
00:46:18.083 --> 00:46:19.875
-He's coming!
-[Julek] Hide! Quick!

479
00:46:21.291 --> 00:46:23.125
Someone's fucking coming!

480
00:46:55.958 --> 00:46:56.916
[Julek gags]

481
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:57.958
Quiet!

482
00:47:03.958 --> 00:47:05.250
[heavy footsteps]

483
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:11.541
[Julek coughs]

484
00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:13.458
Be quiet.

485
00:47:15.875 --> 00:47:18.916
-Calm down. Get a grip.
-Fuck.

486
00:47:30.208 --> 00:47:32.208
[dramatic music]

487
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.416
[grunting]

488
00:47:38.916 --> 00:47:39.750
Quick!

489
00:47:42.083 --> 00:47:43.583
-[Julek] I can't climb!
-[Zosia] Julek!

490
00:47:43.666 --> 00:47:45.708
-Hurry up!
-[Zosia] You can squeeze through.

491
00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:46.791
Hurry!

492
00:47:51.875 --> 00:47:53.541
[cell phone ringing]

493
00:47:56.958 --> 00:47:57.916
Miss Iza!

494
00:48:00.875 --> 00:48:01.708
Run!

495
00:48:10.125 --> 00:48:13.000
Come on. you pimply dumbass!

496
00:48:21.958 --> 00:48:24.416
[screaming]

497
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.416
-Fuck...
-Miss Iza?

498
00:48:36.791 --> 00:48:38.500
[Bartek] I always knew I was gay.

499
00:48:39.708 --> 00:48:40.833
You just feel it.

500
00:48:43.125 --> 00:48:44.833
But I still need to hide it.

501
00:48:46.416 --> 00:48:49.458
Try being gay in this country.

502
00:48:50.583 --> 00:48:51.458
It sucks.

503
00:48:52.375 --> 00:48:54.000
[Aniela] Don't take it to heart.

504
00:48:54.666 --> 00:48:56.375
[scoffs] Seriously?

505
00:48:57.583 --> 00:49:00.333
You're a nice. intelligent guy.

506
00:49:02.916 --> 00:49:05.000
I am constantly being labeled. too.

507
00:49:05.791 --> 00:49:07.541
A dumb bimbo. a blonde.

508
00:49:09.416 --> 00:49:11.166
Just good enough for a fuck.

509
00:49:13.333 --> 00:49:16.666
But I just ignore the rules.
and I'm happy with it.

510
00:49:18.083 --> 00:49:19.541
But deep inside...

511
00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:22.541
I wish I could find...

512
00:49:23.958 --> 00:49:25.083
true love.

513
00:49:27.708 --> 00:49:28.666
A real true love.

514
00:49:30.916 --> 00:49:32.458
[both panting]

515
00:49:32.541 --> 00:49:34.541
[tense music]

516
00:49:35.375 --> 00:49:37.625
[Julek] Is he chasing us? [coughs]

517
00:49:39.625 --> 00:49:40.500
Now what?

518
00:49:42.375 --> 00:49:43.291
I don't know.

519
00:49:43.875 --> 00:49:44.916
Game over.

520
00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:47.125
Game over.

521
00:49:47.208 --> 00:49:49.333
It's fucking over.
What are we going to do?

522
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.958
Fucking locals. Poland "B."
What is this? What am I doing here?

523
00:49:54.041 --> 00:49:56.416
I told you all not to come here!

524
00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.833
-But nobody listened! I want to go home!
-Julek!

525
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:01.791
Get it together.

526
00:50:04.541 --> 00:50:06.916
[gagging]

527
00:50:07.916 --> 00:50:08.791
Julek...

528
00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:13.750
It will be all right. okay?
Just calm down.

529
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:26.750
-We should go back for Daniel's phone.
-No. let's not do that. Please.

530
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:39.041
Okay. listen. Here's what we'll do.

531
00:50:39.125 --> 00:50:41.208
We move on. We find some help.

532
00:50:42.375 --> 00:50:43.375
We can do this.

533
00:50:45.875 --> 00:50:46.750
Promise?

534
00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:52.791
Promise.

535
00:50:54.333 --> 00:50:56.541
My father is blind to everything...

536
00:50:59.208 --> 00:51:03.041
He'd sooner believe I was

If I ever grabbed the friend's butt
